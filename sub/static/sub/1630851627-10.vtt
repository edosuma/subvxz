WEBVTT

00:06.506 --> 00:08.258
[slow ticking]

00:10.010 --> 00:12.012
[explosion rumbling]

00:39.748 --> 00:43.626
[William] This is the Salvare.
The Achaian threat has been neutralized.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.086
-It fucking worked!
-I repeat.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.422
-The threat has been neutralized.
-[all laughing]

00:47.505 --> 00:49.507
-The neutrino gun worked!
-Yeah!

00:50.508 --> 00:51.843
-Erik?
-[Erik] Wow!

00:51.926 --> 00:54.596
I just blew that bastard
right out of the sky.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.264
Niko, did you see that?

00:56.347 --> 01:00.226
It was amazing, and it worked.
But will it work again?

01:01.728 --> 01:02.687
In time.

01:02.771 --> 01:05.148
No. We don't have the luxury of time.

01:05.231 --> 01:08.234
The amount of negative energy required
overloaded the system.

01:08.318 --> 01:09.652
That ring was the first of many.

01:09.736 --> 01:12.739
If we can't reload our weapon,
the Achaians will take it out.

01:13.907 --> 01:17.202
So, what now, Niko? What do we do now?

01:17.285 --> 01:18.620
We've played our hand.

01:20.205 --> 01:22.248
There's really only one way to find out.

01:25.335 --> 01:27.921
[Salvare] Authorization, Cas Isakovic.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.965
We're going back to Earth,
you motherfucker.

01:38.890 --> 01:40.892
-[sighs]
-[radio chatter]

01:45.438 --> 01:46.439
[gasps]

01:48.733 --> 01:50.401
[Niko sighs deeply]

01:52.695 --> 01:53.613
You did it.

01:57.408 --> 01:58.827
I knew that you would.

02:00.578 --> 02:01.496
It's not over yet.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.667
Is he in there?

02:06.334 --> 02:07.168
Yeah.

02:07.669 --> 02:08.586
Be careful.

02:16.010 --> 02:16.845
Seth,

02:17.804 --> 02:20.723
relations between humanity and the Achaia,

02:21.349 --> 02:24.561
to state the obvious, are in a bad spot.

02:26.062 --> 02:28.940
There's been distrust onâ€¦ on both sides,

02:30.233 --> 02:33.236
but nothing that warranted
an attack on the Salvare.

02:34.779 --> 02:36.197
Building a secret weapon?

02:36.281 --> 02:38.241
A defensive weapon.

02:38.324 --> 02:40.702
Defending us against who, Niko?

02:40.785 --> 02:44.289
Some horrible, monstrous species
that saved your daughter's life?

02:44.372 --> 02:47.834
Everywhere that the Achaia go,
death follows.

02:47.917 --> 02:50.253
No, Niko. Wherever you go.

02:53.631 --> 02:57.135
And now you've brought
this personal vendetta back to Earth.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.805
You got some fancy new weapon.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.057
Big fucking deal.

03:03.892 --> 03:06.686
It's not a deterrent.
It's a goddamn mosquito bite.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.230
And the Achaians
will be forced to respond.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.985
Unless you meet their demands.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.238
[Mackenzie] We've agreed to their demands.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.366
Well, now they have new ones.

03:22.160 --> 03:25.079
What if artificial gravity's
creating too much of a counterforce?

03:25.163 --> 03:27.874
I mean, we could disable it
within the accelerator.

03:27.957 --> 03:30.376
I won't be able to work in there,
but, um, you could.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.086
-[bleeping]
-Or not.

03:32.921 --> 03:35.882
I'm pickin' up a massive buildup
of Cherenkov radiation.

03:35.965 --> 03:37.967
Oh, shit. Another wormhole?

03:38.051 --> 03:40.094
It's not just one. Dozens of them.

03:40.178 --> 03:42.180
-Where?
-Everywhere.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.766
[instruments bleeping and whirring]

03:52.565 --> 03:54.234
It's an Achaian invasion force.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.072
What are these new demands?

03:59.155 --> 03:59.989
One.

04:01.115 --> 04:04.577
Allow multiple Artifacts to land on Earth.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.413
Two. Accept their gifts.

04:08.456 --> 04:09.666
All of their gifts.

04:10.291 --> 04:12.126
Those fucking implants?

04:12.752 --> 04:15.421
Advanced tech
that will allow every last human

04:15.505 --> 04:17.423
to achieve his full potential.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.884
And three. Hmm.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.640
Destroy the Salvare.

04:26.140 --> 04:29.435
And that fucking neutrino weapon.
Fly it into the sun.

04:29.519 --> 04:30.728
[laughing]

04:33.648 --> 04:35.316
You have 24 hours to decide.

04:37.735 --> 04:39.070
And if we refuse?

04:39.654 --> 04:41.656
[buzzing and squelching]

04:43.032 --> 04:44.200
[pained laugh]

04:44.284 --> 04:45.243
[electric snapping]

04:45.827 --> 04:47.829
-[moaning]
-[squeaking and whirring]

04:50.456 --> 04:52.292
[grunting]

04:56.170 --> 04:57.922
[whirring continues]

04:58.965 --> 05:00.466
[high-pitched whining]

05:01.592 --> 05:02.468
[gasps]

05:17.275 --> 05:19.527
I understand that
the Achaia have new demands,

05:19.610 --> 05:22.989
but not only are they unacceptable,
they will be impossible to enforce,

05:23.072 --> 05:25.533
and at the same time,
they're impossible to ignore.

05:25.616 --> 05:26.868
We are out of options.

05:26.951 --> 05:29.078
President Bhogal,
the fact that we are here at all

05:29.162 --> 05:32.915
shows that for the first time in
this fight, we have them running scared.

05:33.708 --> 05:36.085
Why don't we present a goodwill gesture?

05:37.086 --> 05:38.629
Agree to one of their requests

05:38.713 --> 05:40.673
and keep the other ones
for more discussion.

05:40.757 --> 05:43.551
-Which would you suggest?
-The Salvare.

05:43.634 --> 05:46.179
Giving the Achaia an inch isn't an option.

05:46.262 --> 05:48.723
-It-- it's a death sentence.
-Commander Breckinridge,

05:48.806 --> 05:51.559
I appreciate that you have more experience
with the Achaia than anyone--

05:51.642 --> 05:54.103
Which give me more insight
into how they work than anyone.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.814
And with all due respect, sir,
that includes you.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.025
What they did to Seth
wasn't just for show.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.652
They want to enslave us all

06:01.736 --> 06:04.197
and put one of those damn things
in every person's head.

06:04.280 --> 06:07.408
Versus destroying our planet, today.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.952
We have temporarily leveled
the playing field

06:10.036 --> 06:12.372
and every second that I stand here
making my case to you

06:12.455 --> 06:15.083
takes time away from
figuring out how to actually beat them.

06:15.166 --> 06:16.959
Sir, just let me do my job.

06:19.420 --> 06:20.838
When the clock runs out,

06:21.798 --> 06:24.217
I will be forced to agree to their terms.

06:27.095 --> 06:30.390
[Mackenzie] You have the entire
USIC infrastructure at your disposal.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.141
Thank you, Madam Secretary.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.395
But what I need can't be found on Earth.

06:36.854 --> 06:38.314
I'll go warm up the shuttle.

06:53.454 --> 06:54.789
[gasps]

07:12.515 --> 07:14.892
[sighs] I almost gave up hope.

07:15.476 --> 07:17.937
-[whispers] Erik.
-I should've known you'd make it back.

07:18.020 --> 07:20.314
-I should have had faith.
-No, it's okay.

07:20.940 --> 07:21.774
It's okay.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.528
I'm here. We're both here, okay?

07:33.035 --> 07:34.871
I think you dropped this.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.088
I saw Jana--

07:44.172 --> 07:46.007
In the Artifact. I know.

07:46.090 --> 07:47.592
She's safe with your mom.

07:49.385 --> 07:52.305
She really is. I mean, Ava's stepped up.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.477
We have so much work to do.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.646
[whispers] Okay.
All right, everyone. Gather round.

08:01.939 --> 08:03.441
Okay. Here's where we are.

08:04.650 --> 08:07.653
We have 57 Achaian rings
surrounding our solar system.

08:07.737 --> 08:11.199
Fifty-nine. Two more just joined
in the last few minutes.

08:11.782 --> 08:14.285
Fifty-nine. And we have
a weapon that can fire,

08:14.368 --> 08:16.579
what, one shot every three minutes?

08:16.662 --> 08:18.873
We've reduced the lag
to two minutes, 13 seconds.

08:18.956 --> 08:21.083
Still, by the time we get
a second shot out--

08:21.167 --> 08:23.878
We wouldn't. Not before one
of those fuckers blew us outta the sky.

08:23.961 --> 08:25.922
That's why the Achaia
aren't running scared.

08:26.005 --> 08:29.592
So how do we scare them, then?
We need to make being here so terrifying--

08:29.675 --> 08:32.011
That they open a wormhole
and get their asses back home.

08:32.094 --> 08:35.556
We keep trying that, but the Achaia
are infinitely more advanced than we are.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.391
If we fight them at their game, we lose.

08:37.475 --> 08:40.353
Every time.
So we need to think outside the box.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.563
Find a way to beat them
they don't see coming.

08:42.647 --> 08:46.025
Basic asymmetric warfare.
So what do we know about the Achaia?

08:46.108 --> 08:49.362
-High-density neutrinos rip them apart.
-Their ships and the Achaia themselves.

08:49.445 --> 08:52.657
Are the Achaia
and their technology one and the same?

08:52.740 --> 08:55.034
[Richard] If they are,
it makes me question their goals.

08:55.117 --> 08:56.661
I mean, they wouldn't want our planet.

08:56.744 --> 08:59.580
They have all the basic raw materials
they'd ever need floating in space.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.415
So they don't want what we've got,

09:01.499 --> 09:04.252
but they will blow up our planet
if we don't roll over on our backs?

09:04.335 --> 09:07.088
And blow up our heads from the inside out.
Don't forget that.

09:07.171 --> 09:08.631
It just doesn't make any sense.

09:08.714 --> 09:11.217
Because we still don't know enough
about them.

09:11.300 --> 09:15.346
It's the same goddamn problem we've had
since that Artifact landed on Earth.

09:16.305 --> 09:18.474
They are seemingly impenetrable.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.768
No. Actually, they're not.

09:21.602 --> 09:22.728
Not anymore.

09:24.522 --> 09:28.150
The vast majority of the Achaian ring
was reduced to dust.

09:28.234 --> 09:31.529
However, scattered among the dust cloud
are a few larger pieces.

09:31.612 --> 09:34.323
I'm thinkin' we send the shuttle out,
grab a piece,

09:34.407 --> 09:36.659
and if Lady Luck is dancing with us,

09:36.742 --> 09:39.453
she'll offer up
somethin' we can use to take them down.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.540
It really is you, huh?

09:43.833 --> 09:44.792
All of you?

09:46.085 --> 09:47.378
Every last bitâ€¦

09:48.921 --> 09:49.755
and byte.

09:50.548 --> 09:51.674
[Niko chuckles softly]

09:54.385 --> 09:55.720
[bleeping]

09:58.806 --> 10:00.433
We got a piece of the ring.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.437
I think we've got somethin'
a little more impressive than that.

10:13.154 --> 10:14.238
An Achaian.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.286
[pulsating, high-pitched whirring]

10:22.330 --> 10:25.249
Are you sure
that thing can't access the ship?

10:25.333 --> 10:26.917
It can't access anything.

10:27.001 --> 10:28.669
I've placed a band-pass filter

10:28.753 --> 10:31.130
for the frequency range
we determined they exist in.

10:31.213 --> 10:32.715
I'll take your word for it.

10:34.091 --> 10:35.968
Why does this one look so muted?

10:36.052 --> 10:40.014
The ones I encountered
have been larger, brighter.

10:40.097 --> 10:43.643
It stands to reason it requires
some kind of energy source to survive.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.019
How long does it have?

10:45.102 --> 10:46.937
Based on lumen deterioration
of the creature

10:47.021 --> 10:50.816
since we brought it on board,
I'd say an hour, maybe a little more.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.611
And what if we provided it
with a power source?

10:53.694 --> 10:57.907
It might work, or it might be like
trying to plug you into a wall socket.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.409
Finish your scans,
and let's regroup in the med lab.

11:00.951 --> 11:02.995
Time's running out for all of us.

11:05.456 --> 11:08.709
[William] DNA is your codin'.
Human codin'.

11:08.793 --> 11:12.588
My codin', at its most basic, is binary.
A bunch of zeros and ones.

11:12.672 --> 11:17.343
Now we have an analysis
into the Achaia at a microscopic level.

11:17.426 --> 11:19.053
This is what I've discovered.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.890
This is just a model of their DNA, right?

11:22.973 --> 11:25.184
No, this is an actual scan.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.145
Is something wrong?

11:28.729 --> 11:33.234
When we build models of our DNA,
we use the letters A, T, G, and C

11:33.317 --> 11:35.945
to represent the nitrogen bases,
symbolically, butâ€¦

11:36.570 --> 11:39.740
these characters are an actual part
of the makeup of these creatures.

11:39.824 --> 11:42.159
It'sâ€¦ odd.

11:42.243 --> 11:46.789
Computer code arranged like organic DNA,
utilizing the Achaian script.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.332
Okay. But why would the Achaia,

11:48.416 --> 11:51.836
who don't have eyes, ears, mouth,
or hands, need a written language?

11:51.919 --> 11:55.047
Maybe these things aren't the Achaia.

11:56.215 --> 11:58.175
Then who is it that we've been fighting?

11:58.259 --> 11:59.927
A completely artificial life-form.

12:00.010 --> 12:01.262
The evolution of you.

12:01.887 --> 12:04.432
So then what are the Achaia? Their makers?

12:05.015 --> 12:06.934
We never made it to their home world.

12:07.852 --> 12:09.061
Are they even there?

12:09.145 --> 12:11.397
Perhaps. Or maybe they died off eons ago.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.441
-Or got killed off.
-It doesn't matter.

12:13.524 --> 12:15.359
These are the creatures
that we're dealing with.

12:15.443 --> 12:18.612
[Richard] So now that we know what
they're made of, how do we fight them?

12:18.696 --> 12:21.699
Go to their home planet
and unplug the whole damn thing?

12:23.033 --> 12:24.201
I'm only half-joking.

12:24.285 --> 12:25.786
What about a computer virus?

12:26.495 --> 12:28.789
I mean, they are just fancy software.

12:28.873 --> 12:31.292
-How do we administer it?
-We hide it by writing malware.

12:31.375 --> 12:34.044
[Erik] Iara's Achaian code wound up
overtaking her human, right?

12:34.128 --> 12:35.880
So reverse engineer that.

12:35.963 --> 12:39.008
I know it's crude, but our human code
rewrites their Achaian code

12:39.091 --> 12:41.135
and hopefully destroys them
in the process.

12:41.218 --> 12:42.052
Can you?

12:42.928 --> 12:44.180
It would take some time.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.348
-We don't have time.
-And we don't have Iara.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.851
-How do we deploy this thing?
-[sighs]

12:49.560 --> 12:52.146
-A Trojan horse.
-[Ursula] Like I said, malware.

12:52.229 --> 12:53.063
No.

12:54.231 --> 12:56.484
I mean like a flesh-and-blood version.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.403
We implant the virus into one of us.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.533
We don't have a spider to do that.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.536
We don't need one.

13:16.837 --> 13:19.632
So, as we know, every member
of the Salvare has a hard wire

13:19.715 --> 13:21.258
that goes into their brain stem.

13:21.342 --> 13:24.261
This is how we induce
and regulate Somatic sleep.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.681
We implant the virus
through the Soma needles.

13:27.765 --> 13:30.351
When the Achaian melds with it,
it catches it.

13:30.935 --> 13:33.395
Why would an Achaian even be tempted
to meld with a human?

13:33.479 --> 13:35.064
Our bodies are forms of hardware,

13:35.147 --> 13:37.399
so electricity flows
through each one of us.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.401
Exactly. And if it's hungry enough--

13:39.485 --> 13:42.363
So you want me to allow an Achaian
to possess one of the crew

13:42.446 --> 13:43.447
and feed off of them?

13:43.531 --> 13:45.950
Just long enough
to get it back down to the Artifact.

13:46.033 --> 13:48.202
And release it along with the malware.

13:48.994 --> 13:49.954
Yeah.

13:50.037 --> 13:50.871
Okay.

13:52.373 --> 13:53.457
What do I have to do?

13:54.458 --> 13:57.461
"Do"? No, you're not doing anything, Niko.

13:57.545 --> 14:00.089
I'm also not allowing one of my crew
to make that sacrifice.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.841
Exactly. It's a sacrifice--

14:01.924 --> 14:02.925
I volunteer.

14:06.053 --> 14:09.223
-Cas--
-Niko, you have a daughter that needs you.

14:10.224 --> 14:13.310
I'm not letting you take this on.
I'm doing it.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.773
I know how to beat the Achaia.

14:18.357 --> 14:19.191
So do I.

14:25.823 --> 14:27.157
[whirring and clicking]

14:27.241 --> 14:29.118
[bleeping]

14:29.910 --> 14:31.036
[Niko] You ready?

14:31.620 --> 14:33.622
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

14:34.373 --> 14:36.125
It can't be any worse than last time.

14:36.959 --> 14:37.877
Are we ready?

14:38.377 --> 14:39.879
On our end? Yeah.

14:40.462 --> 14:41.297
William?

14:41.797 --> 14:43.799
We're having trouble
engineering the virus.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.510
The Achaia operate
on a non-deterministic model,

14:46.594 --> 14:48.137
while human code is deterministic.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.680
I don't need to know why. When?

14:49.763 --> 14:52.808
We may have to implant the virus remotely
after the fact.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.018
Uh, that's not the plan.

14:54.101 --> 14:57.062
No. The plan was to implant it first,
then meld with the Achaian.

14:57.146 --> 15:00.232
The plan has changed because
that Achaian only has moments left.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.776
No, no, no, no, no.
This is all just way too risky.

15:02.860 --> 15:06.030
If the Achaia find out what we are up to,

15:06.113 --> 15:08.240
there's no telling
how they're gonna retaliate.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.367
We're out of options. We've got one shot.

15:10.451 --> 15:11.702
[Erik] It's her life!

15:11.785 --> 15:15.247
[Cas] Exactly. It's my life. Someone needs
to go in there. That someone is me.

15:15.331 --> 15:18.918
[Erik] What we need is to come up
with a new game plan altogether.

15:19.001 --> 15:22.880
I won't be the first member of this crew
to sacrifice themselves for this mission.

15:22.963 --> 15:24.048
Niko, let me in.

15:27.134 --> 15:27.968
No.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.680
Niko, don't you fuckingâ€¦

15:31.764 --> 15:34.099
Get me out of this.
Get these things out of my fucking neck.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.978
[slow, low-pitched whirring]

15:39.063 --> 15:42.775
We could've let you die,
but we didn't. We saved you.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.946
And now we're taking you back
to your people,

15:48.072 --> 15:49.365
inside of me.

15:50.741 --> 15:52.826
I'm risking my life to save yours.

15:55.871 --> 15:59.166
Niko, open the door!

16:06.966 --> 16:07.800
Don't!

16:08.884 --> 16:09.927
[banging]

16:10.010 --> 16:11.387
Niko, don't!

16:13.847 --> 16:14.682
Niko?

16:23.440 --> 16:24.400
No!

16:25.317 --> 16:26.694
[gasps]

16:28.988 --> 16:30.114
Oh, fuckâ€¦

16:37.663 --> 16:39.957
-[beeping]
-[Erik] How are Niko's autonomic systems?

16:40.040 --> 16:43.711
Functioning as normal. Her heart rate
is good, if slightly elevated.

16:43.794 --> 16:44.962
Is that dangerous?

16:45.045 --> 16:48.132
-This is all still uncharted territory.
-Mm-hm. Mm-hm. What else?

16:48.215 --> 16:52.720
I'm reading reduced background rhythms
and triphasic waves within her brain.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.221
She's in a coma.

16:54.304 --> 16:55.764
[Zayn] It's presenting that way, yes.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.434
But I have no idea
if it's because she suffered an injury

16:58.517 --> 17:01.687
or if the Achaian are attempting
to take over her cognitive functions.

17:01.770 --> 17:05.441
Within her cells,
her stores of adenosine triphosphate

17:05.524 --> 17:08.027
are being depleted faster
than they can be replaced.

17:08.110 --> 17:10.612
Yeah. They're draining her
like a fucking vampire.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.491
-Hey. Let me in there. Now.
-We have an update.

17:14.575 --> 17:17.786
We were finally able to mask a human virus
within the Achaian code.

17:18.579 --> 17:21.290
You get this
within 90 centimeters of Niko,

17:21.373 --> 17:24.835
you press the large button,
and it'll transmit the virus remotely.

17:24.918 --> 17:27.212
No, fuck that. We're not doing that, okay?

17:27.296 --> 17:29.590
-I'll go in there, let it take over me--
-You can't.

17:29.673 --> 17:32.551
-You don't have Soma hardware--
-You don't think I know that?

17:37.723 --> 17:39.892
Niko wanted to do this herself.

17:39.975 --> 17:41.727
-[sighs]
-We should honor that.

17:48.358 --> 17:50.736
I'm doing this, alone.

17:50.819 --> 17:53.363
Now open that door, please.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.409
Don't get too close.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.043
[door closes]

18:15.552 --> 18:17.387
I hope this works.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.432
[breathing heavily]

18:21.809 --> 18:22.643
[Erik] Niko,

18:23.769 --> 18:25.020
can you hear me?

18:26.480 --> 18:27.689
[grunts]

18:27.773 --> 18:29.608
-It's okay.
-[joints cracking]

18:30.776 --> 18:32.069
[mechanical voice] Notâ€¦

18:33.320 --> 18:34.279
her.

18:34.363 --> 18:36.240
-[joints cracking]
-[choking]

18:37.032 --> 18:37.991
[distorted yelps]

18:43.664 --> 18:45.999
-[Niko groans]
-[Achaian] Notâ€¦

18:48.502 --> 18:49.670
her.

18:49.753 --> 18:50.587
No.

18:51.630 --> 18:52.756
I guess you're not.

18:53.715 --> 18:55.384
[grunting]

19:04.643 --> 19:06.395
[grunting]

19:07.896 --> 19:09.731
Flesh isâ€¦

19:12.025 --> 19:13.277
primitive.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.736
Primitiveâ€¦

19:14.820 --> 19:18.198
-Disguâ€¦ [gags] â€¦gusting.
-Is she safe?

19:20.534 --> 19:21.994
[Achaian groans]

19:29.710 --> 19:31.170
Should be me in there.

19:33.130 --> 19:34.756
[breathing shakily]

19:37.426 --> 19:38.427
Hey, Cas.

19:40.429 --> 19:44.474
When Iâ€¦ lost my leg in the warâ€¦

19:47.019 --> 19:49.897
everybody else in my unit
came back in body bags.

19:51.857 --> 19:54.109
The guilt I felt was overwhelming.

19:55.861 --> 20:00.032
But none of itâ€¦ none of it was my fault.

20:01.283 --> 20:04.536
They were dead.
I wasn't. It's just the way it is.

20:06.580 --> 20:07.789
Niko went in.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.208
You didn't.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.629
It's just the way it is.

20:18.258 --> 20:19.092
Okay.

20:29.519 --> 20:31.521
-[joints crack]
-[grunting]

20:35.525 --> 20:36.860
Trapped.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.573
And it's keeping you alive.

20:43.784 --> 20:47.412
If we bring you down to the Artifact,
will you release her?

20:47.496 --> 20:52.042
Will you resume talks, so we can come
to a peaceful solution together?

20:53.835 --> 20:55.254
No.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.672
[growling]

21:18.485 --> 21:22.489
[Zayn] The virus has been successfully
transmitted into Niko's Soma implant.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.540
Wish I could hug you, buddy.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.585
Yeah. Niko and Cas
are gonna be successful.

21:36.378 --> 21:37.504
I'll see you again.

22:00.110 --> 22:04.031
I abandoned Gabriel,
and I will not do the same thing to you.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.826
You can't stay, Ursula. It's not safe.

22:13.707 --> 22:16.126
We'll be together. Right till the end.

22:22.716 --> 22:24.718
[engines powering up]

22:31.767 --> 22:33.769
[gentle tinkling]

22:43.820 --> 22:44.946
I'm taking her in.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.615
-No, you're not.
-Yeah, I am.

22:46.698 --> 22:49.659
This is a USIC mission,
and I am the acting commander.

22:49.743 --> 22:52.579
You go in there and things go southâ€¦
You need to think about Jana.

22:53.747 --> 22:54.956
She can't right now.

22:59.628 --> 23:01.338
-[Niko grunts]
-Oh, fuck!

23:03.423 --> 23:04.341
Hey.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.514
Look, I don't know
if you can hear me, butâ€¦

23:12.099 --> 23:13.642
we're at your Artifact,

23:14.768 --> 23:17.187
and we can't open the door ourselves.

23:17.270 --> 23:18.605
-[rumbling]
-Soâ€¦

23:25.195 --> 23:26.571
I'm taking her in, Erik.

23:27.489 --> 23:28.698
Come on, Niko.

23:33.620 --> 23:34.579
Come on.

23:36.123 --> 23:37.165
Come on.

23:39.626 --> 23:40.669
I got you.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.643
Come on, Niko. I got you.

23:57.811 --> 23:59.438
Come on. We're almost there.

24:00.147 --> 24:01.690
-I got you, Niko.
-[whimpers]

24:01.773 --> 24:04.860
All right. You're back
with your kind now. Let Niko go.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.820
[gasping]

24:09.531 --> 24:11.533
-[Niko groans]
-[Achaian whirring]

24:19.040 --> 24:19.916
[moans]

24:20.000 --> 24:21.710
-[gasping and wheezing]
-Niko!

24:23.253 --> 24:25.297
-Don't speak. Conserve your energy.
-[groans]

24:25.380 --> 24:27.507
-Did it work?
-I don't know.

24:27.591 --> 24:28.800
[whooshing]

24:28.884 --> 24:30.510
[intense rumbling]

24:31.928 --> 24:33.263
[clattering]

24:33.346 --> 24:34.514
[both gasping]

24:36.266 --> 24:37.267
Ow!

24:37.350 --> 24:38.977
[whimpering and sobbing]

24:39.060 --> 24:40.520
[grunts]

24:41.521 --> 24:43.648
[intense rumbling]

24:43.732 --> 24:45.150
We did the right thing.

24:45.859 --> 24:47.027
Now it's your turn.

24:51.114 --> 24:53.992
Let us go. Take us back to Earth!

24:55.869 --> 24:59.289
Oh, my little darlings,
you're not going anywhere.

25:04.878 --> 25:06.671
Come on, Niko.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.423
[whirring]

25:08.507 --> 25:10.342
The arrogance of your species.

25:10.425 --> 25:13.303
Making demands of us
like we're your equals.

25:13.386 --> 25:14.638
[laughs]

25:14.721 --> 25:17.057
[distorted voice] Like we'd ever
actually listen to you.

25:17.140 --> 25:18.642
What about negotiations?

25:18.725 --> 25:21.102
Oh, Cas, please!

25:21.186 --> 25:22.812
You're smarter than that.

25:23.647 --> 25:27.275
[voice changing] Negotiations
were only ever going to go our way.

25:27.776 --> 25:28.735
Yeah? What way is that?

25:30.529 --> 25:31.363
Peace.

25:31.988 --> 25:33.573
On your terms?

25:33.657 --> 25:35.158
-[rumbling]
-Always.

25:35.242 --> 25:36.660
-[crashing]
-[gasping]

25:38.495 --> 25:40.205
[Bernie's voice] Yes. On our terms.

25:40.288 --> 25:42.123
[Ava's voice] Of course on our terms.

25:42.207 --> 25:45.168
Your species is the antithesis of peace.

25:45.877 --> 25:50.257
Being inside your body
was a metabolic nightmare.

25:50.340 --> 25:53.009
An insight to your primitive nature.

25:53.093 --> 25:55.178
All theseâ€¦ these juices.

25:55.262 --> 26:00.559
All this meat consuming other life,
chewing it up and then swallowing it

26:01.059 --> 26:02.644
and excreting it out,

26:02.727 --> 26:05.772
leaving your mess behind
for others to clean up.

26:06.356 --> 26:07.357
Cas!

26:08.692 --> 26:12.237
If we don't stop you,
you'll spread like a cancer.

26:12.862 --> 26:13.822
Everywhere.

26:15.907 --> 26:19.411
The Salvare itself will,
of course, provide some insulation,

26:19.494 --> 26:22.539
but only up to 2,600 degrees Celsius.

26:22.622 --> 26:23.790
At what distance?

26:24.374 --> 26:25.834
How close to the sun?

26:25.917 --> 26:27.711
Roughly 2.1 million kilometers.

26:27.794 --> 26:30.630
At that point, our shielding will fail,

26:30.714 --> 26:34.884
and the Salvare will start to disintegrate
until it burns up completely in the sun.

26:34.968 --> 26:36.970
[bleeping and whirring]

26:39.306 --> 26:40.640
You shouldn't be here.

26:44.019 --> 26:45.437
Neither should you.

26:47.897 --> 26:49.190
-[rumbling]
-[Niko] Cas?

26:49.691 --> 26:50.984
[Cas groans]

26:51.067 --> 26:52.527
[Niko] Please say something.

26:54.738 --> 26:56.031
[groans]

26:56.114 --> 26:57.198
[cries out]

26:57.991 --> 26:59.909
Where do you think you're going?

26:59.993 --> 27:03.747
This is your mausoleum, my dear.
There's nowhere for you to go.

27:03.830 --> 27:05.790
She's injured. She needs help.

27:07.250 --> 27:08.627
Take us back to Earth.

27:09.127 --> 27:10.128
Why, Mommy?

27:10.712 --> 27:12.547
So you can leave me again?

27:15.258 --> 27:19.179
So you can load me up
with even more emotional trauma?

27:19.763 --> 27:22.015
So I can spend the rest
of my miserable life

27:22.098 --> 27:24.476
trying to fill the void
you gouged into my soul

27:24.559 --> 27:27.312
by choosing everyone elseâ€¦
[distorted] â€¦over me?

27:27.812 --> 27:29.606
[as Zayn] So arrogant.

27:29.689 --> 27:31.608
So selfish.

27:32.776 --> 27:34.694
Do you remember the colony planet?

27:34.778 --> 27:37.656
Within ten years, the Paregam
would've been completely wiped out

27:37.739 --> 27:39.532
if the Decuma hadn't come along andâ€¦

27:39.616 --> 27:42.202
[distorted] â€¦scraped
your human filth away.

27:43.453 --> 27:44.621
[whimpers]

27:46.706 --> 27:50.627
Our makers brought us
into this universe for a reason.

27:50.710 --> 27:52.587
We cleaned up their messes.

27:53.380 --> 27:56.341
And now we'll clean up yours.

27:57.008 --> 27:58.218
[groans]

27:59.678 --> 28:01.638
-Remember this?
-[whirring]

28:02.972 --> 28:05.308
You can't be trusted
to do the right thing.

28:07.102 --> 28:09.270
Leave her alone. She's innocent.

28:10.980 --> 28:12.190
[Niko gasping]

28:12.273 --> 28:13.983
[distorted] None of you are innocent.

28:14.943 --> 28:16.569
[sobbing]

28:20.782 --> 28:22.617
[crashing]

28:34.462 --> 28:35.839
-[rumbling]
-[gasps]

28:40.135 --> 28:41.970
[radio chatter]

28:45.140 --> 28:46.641
[Richard] The virus is working.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.393
Niko!

28:48.476 --> 28:50.270
[intense rumbling]

28:50.353 --> 28:52.480
What have you done? [gasps]

28:54.691 --> 28:56.609
[screaming]

28:59.195 --> 29:01.197
[distorted scream]

29:02.365 --> 29:04.909
It doesn't matter
what face you throw at me.

29:06.202 --> 29:07.787
I know who you are,

29:08.455 --> 29:09.748
and this ends now.

29:13.126 --> 29:15.628
Cas! We've gotta get out of here.

29:16.212 --> 29:17.088
[groans]

29:17.172 --> 29:18.006
Come on!

29:19.090 --> 29:20.508
-[crashing]
-[Niko] Come on!

29:22.010 --> 29:22.927
Help me!

29:23.011 --> 29:24.387
[metal and glass smashing]

29:24.471 --> 29:25.597
[loud rumbling]

29:37.108 --> 29:38.860
[explosion]

29:42.614 --> 29:45.283
[woman] Communications have been lost
with the Mars colony

29:45.366 --> 29:48.286
and all operations
within the asteroid belt.

29:48.369 --> 29:50.246
There has been no word from the Salvare,

29:50.330 --> 29:53.416
which had set a course
to be neutralized within the sun.

29:59.881 --> 30:00.965
How you doing?

30:02.258 --> 30:03.092
I'm okay.

30:03.968 --> 30:05.220
Just a concussion.

30:05.804 --> 30:06.721
Been through worse.

30:07.222 --> 30:10.809
Next mission out
I'm putting under your command.

30:13.478 --> 30:14.479
You've earned it.

30:18.233 --> 30:19.234
Thank you.

30:20.318 --> 30:24.072
Our solar system is being bombarded
by thousands of micro wormholes.

30:24.155 --> 30:26.407
Could there be
a natural phenomenon to explain it?

30:26.491 --> 30:27.700
None that I know of.

30:27.784 --> 30:29.369
Maybe superluminal communications.

30:29.953 --> 30:31.037
Orders from the Achaia?

30:31.120 --> 30:32.997
All the rings have left our solar system.

30:33.081 --> 30:33.998
Then sleeper agents.

30:34.082 --> 30:35.166
Individuals or governments

30:35.250 --> 30:37.210
-that are Achaian sympathizers.
-[sighs]

30:38.211 --> 30:40.880
-We need William.
-We can't use our deep-space telescopes

30:40.964 --> 30:43.383
to search for them,
not with this interference.

30:43.466 --> 30:45.093
And we need to accept the possibility

30:45.176 --> 30:47.220
-that the Salvare--
-The Salvare made it.

30:49.097 --> 30:50.265
Is that understood?

30:50.765 --> 30:53.393
Understood. We'll keep looking.

30:54.227 --> 30:56.729
Niko, there's someone here to talk to you.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.000
Could I have made that decision?

31:18.042 --> 31:20.753
To, like, leave my husband
and daughter behind?

31:22.046 --> 31:22.881
No way.

31:23.506 --> 31:24.340
Marry me.

31:26.342 --> 31:29.554
Bernie, I love you, and I wanna
spend the rest of my life with you.

31:29.637 --> 31:32.891
I wanna have kids
and get married and-- and everything.

31:32.974 --> 31:34.976
As long as it's with you. Okay?

31:36.728 --> 31:39.731
Okay. I'll--
Sorry, my brain just tends to gush when--

31:39.814 --> 31:41.649
No, no-- Yes, yes, yes.

31:42.275 --> 31:43.818
You're right. I need to shut up.

31:43.902 --> 31:47.071
No, no, no, no, not your brain.
Your-- your brain's amazing. No--

31:47.155 --> 31:48.489
Yeah. I wanna marry you.

31:48.573 --> 31:51.117
I wanna spend
the rest of my life with you.

31:57.707 --> 31:59.334
[Niko] How did you get here?

32:00.460 --> 32:04.172
Grandma called someone in the army
and told them they had to come and get us.

32:04.672 --> 32:07.300
-I think she kinda scared them.
-[laughs]

32:11.638 --> 32:14.599
-Thank you.
-I believe I should be thanking you.

32:14.682 --> 32:17.393
The whole world should be thanking you.

32:26.903 --> 32:27.946
Welcome home.

32:38.331 --> 32:40.667
-[Niko whispers] You're so big.
-[Niko and Jana laugh]

32:46.005 --> 32:47.674
[radio chatter]

32:49.759 --> 32:51.469
A wormhole's appeared
in the Artifact field.

32:52.512 --> 32:53.638
Are they back?

32:53.721 --> 32:56.683
It's not the Achaia, Niko.
It's coming from the Salvare.

33:00.353 --> 33:02.355
[radio chatter]

33:05.942 --> 33:06.859
You're here.

33:08.194 --> 33:11.197
Yeah. We tried announcin' our arrival
the old-fashioned way,

33:11.280 --> 33:14.742
but with all this interference,
our signal wouldn't make it through.

33:14.826 --> 33:17.161
No, I mean you're actually here.

33:17.245 --> 33:18.079
Oh, that.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.206
In this field.

33:21.082 --> 33:24.002
It's a little Achaian trick.

33:24.711 --> 33:26.129
One that Ursula helped me refine.

33:26.212 --> 33:27.338
[gasps]

33:29.298 --> 33:31.718
Uh, we're not quite at corporeal body yet,

33:31.801 --> 33:37.932
but Ursula thinks all the ingredients
are there, thanks to our Achaian friends.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.351
The signals bombarding the solar system,
are they Achaian?

33:40.435 --> 33:41.978
Achaian? No.

33:42.061 --> 33:43.688
Then where are they coming from?

33:44.188 --> 33:45.440
[Ursula] From everywhere.

33:46.065 --> 33:49.777
Hundreds of alien languages reaching out.

33:50.778 --> 33:52.030
What are they sayin'?

33:52.572 --> 33:56.576
I'm comparing the information
to our Achaian database now.

33:57.326 --> 33:58.870
[bleeping and whirring]

34:02.206 --> 34:04.250
I believe they're greetings.

34:06.753 --> 34:08.671
I think they're saying "thank you."

34:10.131 --> 34:11.299
[laughs]

34:15.094 --> 34:17.180
Well, then who wants to go say hello?

34:19.849 --> 34:23.352
[Niko] Everything changed
the day the Achaia landed on Earth.

34:23.853 --> 34:27.523
The question was no longer,
"Is there life out there?"

34:28.232 --> 34:29.734
The question became,

34:31.152 --> 34:32.737
"How much life?"

34:33.446 --> 34:35.782
â™ª Ooh, oohÂ â™ª

34:36.657 --> 34:39.368
â™ª Ooh, oohÂ â™ª

34:39.452 --> 34:42.246
We ventured into the stars to find out.

34:43.748 --> 34:46.125
â™ª It's a good day for dreamin'â€¦ â™ª

34:46.209 --> 34:47.919
Sometimes a connection was made.

34:48.002 --> 34:49.587
â™ª â€¦a spark, there's a fireâ€¦ â™ª

34:49.670 --> 34:51.672
Other times, it didn't go so well.

34:51.756 --> 34:52.882
â™ª â€¦burning brighterâ€¦Â â™ª

34:53.549 --> 34:55.468
Our mission cost us.

34:57.929 --> 35:00.181
Some even paid the ultimate price.

35:02.141 --> 35:04.143
But now we know for sure

35:05.311 --> 35:07.396
that we are not alone.

35:08.856 --> 35:11.234
The universe isn't empty.

35:12.401 --> 35:14.445
It's full of life.

35:15.822 --> 35:20.159
There are hundreds of millions
of habitable planets in our galaxy.

35:21.410 --> 35:23.579
Millions of friends to make.

35:24.914 --> 35:29.502
Humans are simply one branch
of a whole new family tree.

35:30.795 --> 35:34.549
That's why we're headed back
out there again, despite the risks.

35:34.632 --> 35:37.260
To build something stronger.

35:37.927 --> 35:39.220
Something more.

35:39.971 --> 35:42.098
And the first step is to sayâ€¦

35:42.181 --> 35:43.391
-[man 1] Hola.
-[man 2]Â Bonjour.

35:43.474 --> 35:44.976
-[man 3] Ciao.
-[man 2] Konnichi wa.

35:45.059 --> 35:47.728
[voices speaking different languages
overlapping]

35:52.066 --> 35:53.276
[Niko] â€¦"Hello."

35:54.652 --> 35:56.988
â™ª Ooh, oohÂ â™ª

35:57.989 --> 36:00.408
â™ª Ooh, oohÂ â™ª

36:00.992 --> 36:03.911
â™ª Ooh, oohÂ â™ª

36:04.787 --> 36:07.999
â™ª It's a good day for dreamin'Â â™ª

36:10.501 --> 36:13.421
â™ª A life, a time, a changeÂ â™ª

36:13.504 --> 36:16.424
â™ª A crash, a song, a waveÂ â™ª

36:17.049 --> 36:20.261
â™ª The earth, the sky that breaksÂ â™ª

36:20.344 --> 36:22.930
â™ª A map, a road, a wayÂ â™ª

36:23.681 --> 36:26.434
â™ª A voice, a heart that's braveÂ â™ª

36:27.018 --> 36:30.313
â™ª A love, a look, a faceÂ â™ª

36:30.396 --> 36:33.482
-â™ª A sound, a cry, a shakeÂ â™ª
-â™ª Ooh, ooh â™ª

36:33.566 --> 36:36.611
â™ª My eyes are wide awakeÂ â™ª

36:37.904 --> 36:40.573
â™ª Ooh, oohÂ â™ª

36:41.199 --> 36:44.577
-â™ª Ooh, oohÂ â™ª
-â™ª Ooh, oohÂ â™ª

36:44.660 --> 36:46.996
â™ª Ooh, oohÂ â™ª

36:47.496 --> 36:50.833
-â™ª OohÂ â™ª
-â™ª It's a good day for dreamin'Â â™ª

36:50.917 --> 36:53.753
-â™ª Ooh â™ª
-â™ª Ooh, ooh â™ª

36:54.378 --> 36:57.673
-â™ª Ooh, oohÂ â™ª
-â™ª Ooh, oohÂ â™ª

36:57.757 --> 37:00.134
â™ª Ooh, oohÂ â™ª

37:00.635 --> 37:04.347
-â™ª OohÂ â™ª
-â™ª It's a good day for dreamin'Â â™ª

37:04.430 --> 37:07.600
â™ª There's a hope
There's a spark, there's a fireÂ â™ª

37:07.683 --> 37:10.811
â™ª There's a light in the dark
Burnin' brighter â™ª

37:10.895 --> 37:13.940
-â™ª Ooh â™ª
-â™ª Ooh, ooh â™ª

37:14.023 --> 37:14.857
â™ª OohÂ â™ª

37:14.941 --> 37:18.486
-â™ª It's a good day for dreamin' â™ª
-â™ª Ooh, ooh â™ª

37:18.569 --> 37:21.989
â™ª Ooh, ooh â™ª
