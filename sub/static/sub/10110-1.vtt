They're mean as.

01:33.424 --> 01:35.427
You're obsessed
with those little,

01:35.460 --> 01:36.728
rich north shore bitches.

01:36.762 --> 01:38.331
Those rich "north shore bitches"

01:38.364 --> 01:40.233
won internationals
three times in a row.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.268
Only 'cause I wasn't
there to carve them up.

01:42.301 --> 01:44.570
Give them a little
southside heat.

01:44.602 --> 01:46.872
Gonna represent, yo!

01:46.906 --> 01:48.641

Hey, hey, hey!

Yeah! Get it, Kalisha.

02:02.921 --> 02:04.623
Hey!

02:06.257 --> 02:09.193
Hey! 'Sup "G"?

02:09.228 --> 02:10.229
What's up, man?

02:10.262 --> 02:11.730
What's up, Boo?

02:11.764 --> 02:12.765
What's up, Benjy?

02:12.798 --> 02:14.734
Kalisha...

02:14.766 --> 02:17.335
Yo.

02:17.368 --> 02:19.472
-Vonnie.
-What's up? Hey.

02:19.504 --> 02:20.939
What's happening,
what's happening?

02:20.973 --> 02:24.510
Hey, so, I've got
an idea for tonight.

02:24.543 --> 02:25.745
Hey, really?

02:25.777 --> 02:28.447
-Whoa. Stop. Like, give up.
-1, 2.

02:28.479 --> 02:31.216
-1, 2, 2.
-Yeah?

02:31.250 --> 02:32.818
What do you think?

02:32.850 --> 02:35.687
Hey, yeah, maybe we could,
like, add a bit more swag to it.

02:35.721 --> 02:37.956
-Wait, wait. Watch this.
-Hey!

02:37.990 --> 02:39.558
Hey, yeah, yeah.

02:39.592 --> 02:41.761
Yeah, what if you
just sit back down?

02:42.829 --> 02:46.331
About to do this, and
then you just took over.

02:46.365 --> 02:47.466
Anybody else got something?

02:47.498 --> 02:50.703
-Hey!
-Hey! Yeah!

Unh! Okay, okay!

03:01.680 --> 03:05.985
Yeah! Hey, hey!

03:06.018 --> 03:09.955
Hey!

03:09.989 --> 03:12.290
Hey, hey!

03:15.828 --> 03:17.396
What's up, boys?

03:17.429 --> 03:20.332
-Hey.
-Hey!

03:20.366 --> 03:23.903
-Hey, hey!
-Hey, hey!

03:23.936 --> 03:28.941
-Hey!
-Hey!

03:34.780 --> 03:36.248
Hey, I'm gonna
go and get a cone.

03:36.282 --> 03:37.283
Keen for a feed?

03:37.316 --> 03:38.516
No. Eating with my dad.

03:38.550 --> 03:40.386
All right. You sure?

03:40.419 --> 03:41.621
Yep.

03:41.653 --> 03:43.455
Oi! Don't forget
the battle tonight.

03:43.489 --> 03:46.359
Whatever, mum.
Hey, you off home?

03:46.391 --> 03:48.593
No. I got to go study.
Meet at yours at 7:00?

03:48.627 --> 03:51.296
Yeah. Later, loser.

03:51.330 --> 03:53.733
Rude.

03:53.765 --> 03:55.768
<i>For the land of the long white</i>

03:55.800 --> 03:57.836
<i>And my mom for the whole flight</i>

03:57.870 --> 04:00.506
<i>Yeah, just a small-town
kid with the midas touch</i>

04:00.538 --> 04:02.641
<i>Trying to make some memories
before the time is up</i>

04:02.675 --> 04:03.676
<i>And it's all</i>

04:03.709 --> 04:05.645
<i>I feel so good today</i>

04:05.677 --> 04:08.247
<i>I feel so good today</i>

04:16.487 --> 04:17.490
Son...

04:19.757 --> 04:24.362
How was your day?

04:24.396 --> 04:27.600
Same as yesterday.

04:27.632 --> 04:29.534
You're done with school.

04:29.567 --> 04:31.403
What are your plans
after the summer?

04:31.437 --> 04:32.805
I don't know?

04:32.838 --> 04:34.573
Hey, I got the job
at the warehouse.

04:34.605 --> 04:36.641
-Recycling plastic.
-It's work.

04:36.675 --> 04:38.511
Heaps of people around
here don't even have jobs.

04:38.543 --> 04:41.781
I promised your mother you'd
make something of yourself,

04:41.814 --> 04:42.915
and that's why I've decided

04:42.949 --> 04:45.818
if you don't have a better
plan after the summer...

04:47.886 --> 04:49.487
You're joining the army.

04:49.521 --> 04:50.788
-What?
-You heard me.

04:50.822 --> 04:53.459
You got six weeks to decide what
you're gonna do with your life.

04:53.492 --> 04:55.762
-That's bullshit.
-Watch your mouth.

04:58.430 --> 05:01.100
Look, I know the army
isn't a flash life,

05:01.132 --> 05:04.370
but this is something
you can be proud of.

05:05.204 --> 05:07.406
Oi! Loser, we're gonna be late.

05:07.439 --> 05:10.443
Coming.

05:11.642 --> 05:14.512
Sarge, the army's your thing.

05:14.545 --> 05:16.682
If you don't find
something better,

05:16.714 --> 05:18.116
it'll be your thing, too.

05:18.149 --> 05:19.685
Tu, hurry up!

05:23.488 --> 05:24.656
Let's go.

05:24.689 --> 05:29.528
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

05:59.158 --> 06:00.693
<i>Change the climate,

06:00.725 --> 06:02.560
<i>Choking on a cohiba</i>

06:02.593 --> 06:03.896
<i>Sculling back Cuba libres</i>

Army or no army, you're
always part of the crew, cuz.

06:50.242 --> 06:51.710
Forget that.

06:51.742 --> 06:53.512
I am not joining the army.

06:53.545 --> 06:54.914
What else are you gonna do?

06:56.081 --> 06:58.617
Yo, Tu!

Yo!

-Far out.

07:23.875 --> 07:25.143
I'll flick you the link.

07:25.177 --> 07:27.680
Cheers, bro.

07:27.713 --> 07:29.548
If we want to rip
it up at regionals,

07:29.581 --> 07:31.650
we have to start going harder.

07:31.682 --> 07:32.651
Yeah, like that's gonna happen.

07:32.684 --> 07:36.489
Straight up. If only
everyone just focused.

07:36.521 --> 07:37.555
What do you care?

07:37.588 --> 07:38.689
You're off to uni soon anyway.

07:38.723 --> 07:41.627
Bro, I'm not going anywhere
without that scholarship.

07:41.660 --> 07:42.761
You're brainy.

07:42.793 --> 07:44.262
Uni-level.

07:44.295 --> 07:45.497
You got this.

07:47.132 --> 07:48.733
Maybe I should join the army.

07:50.201 --> 07:53.172
What? I'd be a better
soldier than you would.

07:53.204 --> 07:54.507
Yeah, probs.

07:54.540 --> 07:58.277
Chin up. Sarge might
change his mind.

07:58.310 --> 07:59.944
Not even.

07:59.978 --> 08:02.548
See you tomorrow, loser.

08:02.581 --> 08:03.850
Later, nerd.

08:18.230 --> 08:20.766
We got to get you ready
for boot camp, soldier.

08:20.798 --> 08:22.567
Rise and shine!

08:22.600 --> 08:24.103
Up and up!

08:25.170 --> 08:27.073
Up and up, son.

08:28.706 --> 08:30.877
We are moving!

08:31.944 --> 08:35.313
Life isn't a box of chocolates.

08:35.346 --> 08:39.751
We couldn't afford
chocolates, so I had no idea.

08:39.784 --> 08:40.985
Come on, son.

08:41.019 --> 08:43.556
Don't let your old
man show you up.

08:43.589 --> 08:46.292
-Hold up!
-To the top.

08:53.664 --> 08:56.601
You'll do better tomorrow, son.

08:56.634 --> 08:58.903
Tomorrow? What?

08:58.937 --> 09:00.639
And every day until you enlist.

09:00.672 --> 09:04.576
We'll find something
better to do with your life.

09:04.610 --> 09:05.911
What if I do have something?

09:05.943 --> 09:08.279
Recycling plastics
doesn't count, son.

09:08.312 --> 09:12.717
-Forget it.
-Okay. Well, tell me, then.

09:12.750 --> 09:13.918
-Hip
-hop.

09:13.951 --> 09:14.919
What?

09:14.952 --> 09:16.588
-Hip
-hop! Dancing!

09:16.621 --> 09:18.990
No, mate. Nice try.
I mean a real job, Tu.

09:19.024 --> 09:20.692
<i>That is a real job.</i>

09:20.725 --> 09:22.827
People make mean money
going all around the world.

09:22.860 --> 09:24.362
People like your
mates from work?

09:24.395 --> 09:25.863
<i>You think they'll make
it big anytime soon?</i>

09:29.234 --> 09:31.737
Moving.

10:03.934 --> 10:05.770
This heat is bullshit.

10:05.803 --> 10:08.807
Aw, man. There's only one damn
fan in this whole building.

10:11.842 --> 10:13.044
Got any sprays?

10:13.077 --> 10:15.280
Yeah, in the back pocket.

10:20.418 --> 10:24.023
-Bro.
-What?

10:24.056 --> 10:26.425
Don't tell me you're
holding at work.

10:26.457 --> 10:28.827
I'm not holding at work.

10:30.261 --> 10:32.163
I'm not gonna leave it at home.

10:32.197 --> 10:35.734
My auntie would thrash
me with a jandal.

10:35.767 --> 10:38.638
Well, are you
using that or what?

11:08.100 --> 11:11.170
Look at this place, man.

11:16.841 --> 11:19.977
Yo, are you Tu kaea?

11:20.010 --> 11:21.879
It depends.

11:21.913 --> 11:23.215
Who's asking?

11:23.248 --> 11:24.950
You might want to check
that attitude, bro.

11:24.982 --> 11:26.984
-Bro!
-Brant, relax.

11:27.018 --> 11:30.822
We didn't come all this
way to start trouble.

11:30.855 --> 11:32.957
We saw your clip.

11:32.990 --> 11:35.360
-Not bad.
-Thanks.

11:35.393 --> 11:38.096
Kane thinks you have what
it takes to join our crew.

11:40.264 --> 11:43.735
I...

11:43.769 --> 11:44.970
I've already got a crew.

11:48.038 --> 11:51.143
So we've come all
this way for nothing?

11:59.484 --> 12:01.887
Hey...

12:01.919 --> 12:04.889
Can I think about it?

12:04.923 --> 12:07.091
-This is a one
-time offer.

12:07.125 --> 12:09.128
Studio's on the north shore.

12:09.160 --> 12:10.828
Address is on the site.

12:10.861 --> 12:12.997
Be there at 4:00
or don't bother.

12:13.030 --> 12:15.466
Hope to see you there.

12:21.405 --> 12:23.141
Who was that?

12:23.174 --> 12:27.311
Bro, you're not
gonna believe it.

12:27.345 --> 12:29.281
That was K-crew.

12:29.313 --> 12:31.916
<i>-Real?! Like the k
-crew?</i>

12:31.950 --> 12:33.018
<i>-The k
-crew.</i>

12:33.051 --> 12:35.954
They want me to audition, man.

12:35.986 --> 12:38.022
Should I do it?

12:38.056 --> 12:41.059
Hell yes! This
could be it for you!

12:41.091 --> 12:43.528
This could be your chance
to get out of this place

12:43.562 --> 12:45.798
and to do it big.

12:45.831 --> 12:48.066
I don't know.

12:48.099 --> 12:51.003
Look, imagine you're me

12:51.035 --> 12:52.870
and your best
mate just got given

12:52.903 --> 12:56.575
the opportunity of a
lifetime dropped in his lap.

12:56.607 --> 12:59.977
Now, what would
you tell him to do?

13:00.010 --> 13:01.012
What do I tell the others?

13:01.046 --> 13:03.048
-Nothing.
-But Vonnie.

13:03.081 --> 13:04.850
Vonnie don't need to know.

13:04.883 --> 13:07.853
<i>No one needs to know, not
till they need to know.</i>

13:07.885 --> 13:09.387
Yeah. I guess you're right.

13:09.421 --> 13:13.258
I know I'm right, and so do you.

13:13.291 --> 13:16.028
K-crew.

13:16.061 --> 13:18.897
It's there. Pretty mean.

13:18.929 --> 13:22.600
Sort of get in early, get
out early kind of thing?

13:22.634 --> 13:24.937
I've been working with kids
on their school holidays

13:24.970 --> 13:26.071
for 20 years,

13:26.105 --> 13:30.042
and no one's ever wanted to
start their shift earlier.

13:30.075 --> 13:32.878
Since my dad's got me up
at the ass crack of dawn,

13:32.910 --> 13:36.013
I reckon I'd just start the day.

13:39.083 --> 13:42.887
6:00 on the dot.

13:42.921 --> 13:45.456
Don't make me regret it.

13:45.490 --> 13:46.926
I won't.

13:49.360 --> 13:51.495
Try and keep up, old man.

13:52.464 --> 13:56.402
Good to see you
finally showed up, son.

14:10.181 --> 14:12.184
<i>Check it out, 1, 2</i>

14:12.216 --> 14:13.651
<i>Hey, yo, hey, yo</i>

14:13.684 --> 14:15.620
<i>I came a long way
since back in the day</i>

14:15.653 --> 14:18.222
<i>From a teenager tryin' to
make it, rappin' this way</i>

14:18.255 --> 14:20.458
<i>Ever since I was a kid,
i had somethin' to say</i>

14:20.491 --> 14:23.027
<i>Rockin' Mikes was the dream,
i didn't care about pay</i>

14:23.061 --> 14:25.364
<i>I sacrificed late nights
and goin' out with my friends</i>

14:25.397 --> 14:27.900
<i>Just to stay home alone
with my pad and my pen</i>

14:27.932 --> 14:30.034
<i>Had my eyes on my
prize, my mind on my goal</i>

14:30.067 --> 14:32.638
<i>As I carved these rhymes
out with my heart and my soul</i>

14:32.671 --> 14:34.973
<i>I didn't have a cd,
all I had was a tape</i>

14:35.005 --> 14:37.475
<i>On the dole through my
flow was my only escape</i>

14:37.509 --> 14:39.912
<i>From a world where they
didn't want to see me prevail</i>

14:39.945 --> 14:41.113
<i>Don't want to see me take it all</i>

14:41.145 --> 14:42.213
<i>They'd rather see me fail</i>

14:42.246 --> 14:43.581
<i>It's like</i>

14:43.615 --> 14:48.653
<i>I was down and out, struggling</i>

14:48.687 --> 14:53.258
<i>Wondered how I'm
gonna make it through</i>

14:53.291 --> 14:55.127
<i>I got a dream</i>

14:55.159 --> 14:56.928
<i>All I had was a pad and a pen</i>

14:56.961 --> 14:58.596
<i>Holding on</i>

14:58.629 --> 15:00.966
<i>Wondered how</i>

15:03.134 --> 15:06.004
<i>I got a dream</i>

15:07.672 --> 15:11.076
<i>I won't let go 'cause I got...</i>

15:26.124 --> 15:27.659
Come on.

15:33.197 --> 15:35.100
Thanks for coming.

15:35.133 --> 15:37.336
Really stoked to have you here.

15:38.736 --> 15:40.605
We've seen your footage.

15:40.638 --> 15:44.977
You know you got the moves,
but do you have what it takes?

15:45.009 --> 15:48.212
Behind me are the best
dancers in New Zealand,

15:48.245 --> 15:50.148
among some of the
best in the world.

15:50.181 --> 15:53.151
And with myself, we make up
the K-crew's national team.

15:53.183 --> 15:55.319
Three-time world champions.

15:55.352 --> 15:56.554
Yeah, buddy.

15:56.587 --> 15:59.091
You have six weeks
before regionals

15:59.124 --> 16:00.524
to show us what you got.

16:00.557 --> 16:05.062
You show us you got the k-factor,
you're in K-crew.

16:05.096 --> 16:12.004
But if you're ever late or you
don't show up, I will cut you.

16:12.037 --> 16:13.437
I don't care if you're sick.

16:13.471 --> 16:15.307
I don't care if you have jobs.

16:15.340 --> 16:19.144
Either we're your
priority or we're not.

16:19.177 --> 16:23.048
And if we're not, leave now.

16:24.682 --> 16:26.183
All right then.

16:26.216 --> 16:28.586
Brant, take them through.

16:28.620 --> 16:31.490
All right, guys, we're
doing basic choreography.

16:31.523 --> 16:33.325
Here we go. Music. Let's do it.

16:33.357 --> 16:37.695
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

16:45.202 --> 16:52.211
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey</i>

16:54.178 --> 16:55.780
It's close.

16:55.813 --> 16:58.817
But for it to work, you have to
do it just like everyone else.

16:58.850 --> 17:00.719
Watch me.

17:09.126 --> 17:11.396
Better.

17:12.195 --> 17:15.199
So, you know everyone here?

17:15.232 --> 17:18.569
<i>Kind of. I know
of everyone here.</i>

17:20.204 --> 17:22.073
What's her story?

17:22.106 --> 17:23.208
Sasha?

17:23.240 --> 17:24.709
Moved over last year.

17:24.741 --> 17:28.145
Been repping out
competitions ever since.

17:28.179 --> 17:29.346
Moved from where?

17:29.380 --> 17:30.715
New York.

17:30.748 --> 17:33.117
-Is she with Kane?
-Better believe it.

17:33.151 --> 17:34.653
Off-limits, Romeo.

17:34.685 --> 17:37.422
Yo, you guys both made it in.

17:37.454 --> 17:39.691
Next session's tricks, though.

17:39.723 --> 17:42.394
Sweet. Thanks, brant.

17:42.426 --> 17:46.230
-Trick.
-Whatever.

17:46.263 --> 17:48.132
You fellas got a beef?

17:48.165 --> 17:49.733
Let's just say

17:49.767 --> 17:53.105
not everyone is as comfortable
with my sexuality as I am.

17:53.137 --> 17:55.339
-What a dick.
-I'm used to it.

17:55.373 --> 17:56.775
Hater's gonna hate.

17:56.807 --> 17:58.710
I bet they're gonna
work us like dogs

17:58.742 --> 18:00.644
to get us ready for regionals.

18:00.678 --> 18:03.515
Woof, woof.

18:28.605 --> 18:29.473
Tu.

18:29.507 --> 18:32.344
Tu, come on. Wake up.

18:41.685 --> 18:43.654
Thanks.

18:47.959 --> 18:50.562
Bro, they've got
a massive studio...

18:50.595 --> 18:53.298
All these mirrors,
locker room, showers.

18:53.330 --> 18:54.632
Sweet setup.

18:54.665 --> 18:57.168
So party on the
north shore, is it?

18:57.201 --> 18:59.436
Nah. We'll party on the
shore if I make the crew.

18:59.470 --> 19:01.206
So when do you find that out?

19:01.239 --> 19:02.207
Six weeks of auditions.

19:02.240 --> 19:03.642
Six weeks?

19:03.674 --> 19:05.342
Oi.

19:05.375 --> 19:09.181
Is Phil all good with you
working half days that long?

19:09.213 --> 19:11.316
I'm here at 6:00,
opening up shop.

19:11.348 --> 19:13.751
Look at you?

19:13.785 --> 19:16.254
Can you flip me the key
so I can hustle some green?

19:17.721 --> 19:19.590
Uncle Tucker's been
bugging me for a new spot.

19:19.624 --> 19:22.394
This place is busy,
but low-key it is

19:22.426 --> 19:24.762
and heaps of places
to stash my stuff.

19:24.796 --> 19:26.597
Just 'cause I ain't
gonna dob you

19:26.631 --> 19:28.200
doesn't mean I'm
gonna help you out.

19:28.232 --> 19:29.334
Yeah, yeah.

19:29.367 --> 19:32.269
But I'm serious about a
party on the shore, though.

19:32.303 --> 19:34.406
Put a little brown
in browns bay.

19:34.439 --> 19:36.240
Got the "little" part right.

19:36.273 --> 19:37.441
Go from this last part.

19:37.474 --> 19:40.311
Smash it out. 5, 6, 7, and 8.

19:40.345 --> 19:43.214
Go 1 and 2 and 3 and ta.

19:43.248 --> 19:46.250
Ta, ta, ta, ta,
ta, ta, boom, ka.

19:46.284 --> 19:47.519
-Yes?
-Okay, all good.

19:47.551 --> 19:49.320
Practice that. Take a break.

19:49.354 --> 19:50.755
We'll come back to it.

19:50.788 --> 19:52.958
Crew not good enough
for you anymore, docks?

19:54.092 --> 19:56.261
Yeah, my auntie said that
she seen you on the bus

19:56.294 --> 19:57.461
going to the north shore.

19:57.494 --> 19:58.929
What's up with that, man?

19:58.962 --> 20:00.965
Yeah...

20:00.999 --> 20:02.666
Are you gonna tell
them, or should I?

20:02.700 --> 20:04.436
What? Tell them what?

20:04.469 --> 20:06.837
Gather around.

20:06.871 --> 20:08.506
-What's happening?
-I've got an announcement.

20:08.538 --> 20:09.840
Benjy, don't.

20:09.874 --> 20:11.343
What's up?

20:11.375 --> 20:13.912
On me.

20:17.648 --> 20:19.316
Tu's in love with a shore girl.

20:20.917 --> 20:22.286
Sad, but true.

20:22.319 --> 20:23.989
-It's nothing serious.
-Nothing serious?

20:24.021 --> 20:26.523
Hell, she got this
maori catching a bus

20:26.557 --> 20:28.793
for three hours two days a week.

20:28.826 --> 20:29.928
What?

20:29.961 --> 20:31.262
Boy's whooped!

20:31.296 --> 20:33.030
-This boy's wet!
-Yeah.

20:34.365 --> 20:36.734
Well...

20:36.768 --> 20:40.505
<i>When a rich, white
girl call for him</i>

20:40.538 --> 20:43.508
lord!

20:43.540 --> 20:45.876
Take a break.

20:48.378 --> 20:52.317
<i>He got to ride that
bus to the north shore</i>

20:52.349 --> 20:53.817
whoo!

20:53.851 --> 20:54.919
Yeah!

20:54.951 --> 20:56.788
<i>If he want it,</i>

20:56.820 --> 20:59.757
<i>he got to ride it
so he can wine it</i>

20:59.790 --> 21:01.292
<i>baby, baby</i>

21:01.326 --> 21:03.761
<i>if he want it, he got to ride it</i>

21:03.795 --> 21:05.397
Benjy, what?

21:08.365 --> 21:11.368
<i>So he can grind it baby, baby</i>

21:11.402 --> 21:16.408
<i>if you want it, you got to
ride it till you can grind it</i>

21:23.815 --> 21:26.451
-See you fellas later.
-Peace.

21:28.353 --> 21:30.422
Bro, stop stalling.
You've got to...

21:40.464 --> 21:44.001
Hey, Tucker, it's Benjy.

21:44.035 --> 21:45.403
What?!

21:45.435 --> 21:47.471
Yo, Tu!

21:47.505 --> 21:50.875
"G," do you remember
that video I made of you?

21:50.907 --> 21:52.343
Yeah.

21:52.376 --> 21:53.912
That's had 20,000 views.

21:59.784 --> 22:00.885
Yo.

22:00.919 --> 22:03.121
I don't think your head's
allowed to get any bigger.

22:03.153 --> 22:04.855
It's ugly enough already.

22:04.888 --> 22:10.394
Yo, Tu. Tu, can I talk to you?

22:10.428 --> 22:12.530
Yeah.

22:12.563 --> 22:13.798
Alone?

22:13.830 --> 22:15.132
What are you up to you?

22:15.165 --> 22:16.900
Don't you worry about
what we're up to.

22:16.933 --> 22:18.670
Get home before
you get in trouble.

22:18.702 --> 22:20.771
Whatever, ball sack.
Come, Ceejay.

22:20.805 --> 22:23.775
The girls are having
a heart-to-heart.

22:23.807 --> 22:25.442
Bro, my uncle's
place just got raided.

22:25.476 --> 22:27.145
I really need your key.

22:27.178 --> 22:27.946
What? No.

22:27.979 --> 22:29.847
Bro, I just need it for tonight.

22:29.881 --> 22:31.583
Then I'll give it straight back.

22:31.615 --> 22:34.051
-I could lose my job, man.
-I know.

22:34.085 --> 22:36.755
I wouldn't ask if
this wasn't legit.

22:36.788 --> 22:38.423
Tucker's on me hard.

22:38.455 --> 22:41.525
So...?

22:41.558 --> 22:42.527
Did I help you before?

22:42.559 --> 22:43.595
Yeah, but...

22:43.627 --> 22:48.432
So two-way street, bro.

22:48.465 --> 22:51.502
I'm serious, Tu. I need this.

22:57.642 --> 22:59.544
I want it back tomorrow.

22:59.576 --> 23:01.913
Tomorrow, first thing.

23:04.449 --> 23:05.583
Thanks, man.

23:05.615 --> 23:07.385
Yeah, yeah. See you.

23:20.530 --> 23:21.899
Nice, Conrad.

23:21.932 --> 23:23.167
Jase.

23:23.201 --> 23:26.971
Show you how it's done.

23:29.906 --> 23:32.676
Keep him in the middle,
team! Let's go!

23:41.885 --> 23:44.588
<i>Wallin' on it</i>

23:46.958 --> 23:48.493
let's take it up a notch.

23:48.526 --> 23:50.095
Brant, Andrew.

23:54.798 --> 23:57.134
<i>Wa, wa, wallin' on it</i>

24:03.240 --> 24:05.076
<i>Wa, wallin'</i>

24:09.980 --> 24:12.083
We got any pairs in the house?

24:12.115 --> 24:14.152
-Yo.
-Yo.

24:17.788 --> 24:20.759
Twins, bro. Twins.

24:29.834 --> 24:33.505
Madison, give me some queen bee.

24:45.615 --> 24:47.985
Yeah!

24:48.019 --> 24:49.554
We got any girls left?

24:49.586 --> 24:51.823
Yeah. Tino's left.

24:51.855 --> 24:53.758
Brant, that's enough.

24:53.790 --> 24:56.226
-All right.
-Sophie.

24:56.259 --> 24:58.096
No.

24:58.128 --> 24:59.796
I got this.

25:24.888 --> 25:27.791
Sasha, your turn.

25:47.811 --> 25:49.680
Tu, what you got?

25:49.713 --> 25:51.883
Top that?

25:51.915 --> 25:54.118
What's the holdup?

27:08.025 --> 27:11.696
So, won these today.

27:11.729 --> 27:13.765
Not really my style.

27:13.798 --> 27:15.700
What are you on about?

27:15.732 --> 27:16.733
These kicks are choice.

27:20.070 --> 27:22.305
Turns out you have some tricks.

27:22.338 --> 27:24.708
A couple.

27:24.741 --> 27:26.911
I seen you guys jam before.

27:26.943 --> 27:28.779
Didn't know you
could dance like that.

27:28.813 --> 27:32.784
Well, ballet really
isn't Kane's thing.

27:32.817 --> 27:34.885
Probably 'cause he can't
lift his leg up that high.

27:36.753 --> 27:37.988
True.

27:38.021 --> 27:42.226
But he does know how
to win championships.

27:44.795 --> 27:47.865
Anyway, I'm out.

27:47.897 --> 27:49.866
A'ight.

27:49.900 --> 27:52.836
Check you out, girl.

27:52.869 --> 27:54.705
See you next week?

27:54.739 --> 27:57.142
A'ight.

28:00.978 --> 28:03.181
Out of the trenches!

28:05.249 --> 28:06.951
Son.

28:06.983 --> 28:08.952
Let me see your war face!

28:08.986 --> 28:10.888
Outside for stretches!

28:10.921 --> 28:12.757
Move it, move it, move it!

28:14.090 --> 28:17.794
<i>I got the new world in my view</i>

28:17.827 --> 28:20.998
<i>On my journey I pursue</i>

28:21.030 --> 28:22.834
<i>I'm running</i>

28:22.866 --> 28:24.167
<i>Running for the city</i>

28:24.201 --> 28:27.270
<i>I got the new world in my view</i>

28:27.304 --> 28:29.307
<i>They ain't got muscle, no hustle</i>

28:29.339 --> 28:31.141
<i>No backbone, I stand alone</i>

28:31.174 --> 28:33.310
<i>Not trippin', just
sayin' I'm different</i>

28:33.344 --> 28:36.080
<i>Ain't hangin' on to the
coattails of the next man</i>

28:36.113 --> 28:37.414
<i>Passport in my left hand</i>

28:37.448 --> 28:39.217
<i>Thinkin' that you are next</i>

28:39.250 --> 28:40.785
<i>Heck, hope you ain't
holding your breath, man</i>

28:40.817 --> 28:41.919
<i>'Cause I'm out here</i>

28:41.951 --> 28:43.855
Boom, boom.

28:43.887 --> 28:47.090
<i>Ain't had this much drive
since my Honda civic got rusty</i>

28:47.124 --> 28:50.294
You should leave.

28:50.326 --> 28:53.830
See ya.

28:53.864 --> 28:55.298
Run it again.

28:55.332 --> 28:57.168
<i>Spoiled it on me
like Willie beanie</i>

28:57.201 --> 28:58.970
<i>Sip it for me like cappuccino</i>

28:59.002 --> 29:00.871
<i>Instagram and tuxedos
with my peoples</i>

29:00.904 --> 29:02.240
<i>We growin' up</i>

29:02.272 --> 29:03.940
<i>Still the scene of us slowin' up</i>

29:03.973 --> 29:05.308
<i>Tense wall we throwin' up</i>

29:05.342 --> 29:07.111
<i>Every time, we be showin' up</i>

29:07.144 --> 29:08.512
<i>Get it while I'm livin'</i>

29:08.546 --> 29:10.213
Up, up, up.

29:10.247 --> 29:11.349
See them?

29:11.382 --> 29:13.151
<i>So I'm 'bout my business</i>

29:13.183 --> 29:14.885
<i>And I'm runnin', I'm runnin'</i>

29:14.919 --> 29:16.954
<i>I'm runnin' with them now</i>

29:16.987 --> 29:18.556
<i>They don't wanna give it up</i>

29:18.588 --> 29:19.823
<i>We gonna make it out</i>

29:34.003 --> 29:36.807
Hey. I'm almost done. I promise.

29:36.840 --> 29:38.508
You're breaking in?

29:38.541 --> 29:40.877
-No, i
-i got a key. I got once cut.

29:40.911 --> 29:42.913
So you involve me
in this bullshit now.

29:42.946 --> 29:44.181
-No.
-No, no, no, no.

29:44.214 --> 29:45.949
I can't believe you!

29:45.982 --> 29:46.850
Piss off, Benjy!

29:46.884 --> 29:49.220
Get that shit out of here.

30:05.001 --> 30:06.303
<i>I've been</i>

30:06.336 --> 30:12.108
<i>Feelin' a little lonely</i>

30:15.045 --> 30:17.480
Okay, stop playing around.

30:17.513 --> 30:20.517
Not until you teach me
some of your fancy moves.

30:21.384 --> 30:23.855
Okay, you're not
taking it seriously.

30:23.887 --> 30:24.923
Excuse me?

30:24.955 --> 30:27.190
I'm trying to broaden my
dance horizons, a'ight?

30:30.059 --> 30:34.598
Okay.

30:34.632 --> 30:39.903
<i>I see you inside my daydreams</i>

30:41.404 --> 30:43.340
Do you want to try some lifts?

30:43.374 --> 30:45.175
Sure.

30:45.209 --> 30:48.078
Okay. I'm gonna run to you.

30:48.112 --> 30:50.948
Turn around. Face this way.

30:50.980 --> 30:52.383
Okay.

30:52.415 --> 30:55.118
I'm gonna run, put my leg here,

30:55.152 --> 30:57.288
and you're gonna wrap
your arm around my body,

30:57.320 --> 31:00.657
and you're gonna flip
me over your shoulder.

31:00.691 --> 31:03.027
This shoulder?

31:03.059 --> 31:04.394
Like superman.

31:04.428 --> 31:06.030
-Like superman?
-Yeah.

31:06.063 --> 31:07.398
-Use those muscles.
-Yo.

31:07.431 --> 31:09.967
-Okay, ready? Try it slow.
-Yeah.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.303
5, 6, 7, 8.

31:12.336 --> 31:15.038
1, 2, 3, grab, pull forward.

31:15.071 --> 31:17.474
So... not there!

31:19.042 --> 31:21.011
No, okay. Again?

31:21.045 --> 31:23.147
Yeah, yeah, okay.

31:23.180 --> 31:25.682
You want to try running into it?

31:25.715 --> 31:27.484
-Sure.
-Okay.

31:27.518 --> 31:29.586
Here we go.

31:29.619 --> 31:31.521
1, 2, 3, 4, lift.

31:34.490 --> 31:35.593
So close.

31:35.625 --> 31:38.663
What do you mean,
close? That was it.

31:38.695 --> 31:41.698
No, hold up.

31:41.731 --> 31:43.533
Let's dance.

31:43.567 --> 31:45.603
Pardon me.

32:00.084 --> 32:02.553
<i>It's no surprise</i>

32:02.586 --> 32:06.257
<i>That we ain't in heaven</i>

32:06.289 --> 32:08.392
<i>We're on the earth</i>

32:08.424 --> 32:10.360
<i>But you</i>

32:10.394 --> 32:14.731
<i>You meet me in my darkest cavern</i>

32:14.765 --> 32:17.001
<i>Can't count what you are worth</i>

32:17.034 --> 32:21.372
<i>'Cause, baby, when
the waves crash over me</i>

32:21.404 --> 32:26.042
<i>And, baby, when
the skies turn crazy</i>

32:26.076 --> 32:30.981
<i>You're the only one
i want next to me</i>

32:31.015 --> 32:33.050
<i>Me</i>

32:33.083 --> 32:37.254
<i>With every passin' second,
every drop of fallin' rain</i>

32:37.287 --> 32:40.991
<i>I realize I'm lucky
to be holding you</i>

32:41.025 --> 32:45.563
<i>When my ground starts shakin'
and my bones start breakin'</i>

32:45.596 --> 32:49.666
<i>I realize I'm lucky
to be holdin' you</i>

32:49.700 --> 32:53.037
<i>We ain't in a perfect world</i>

32:53.069 --> 32:55.572
<i>But you still
bring the stars out</i>

32:55.605 --> 32:57.141
I'm sorry.

32:57.173 --> 32:58.608
Am I interrupting something?

32:58.642 --> 33:01.644
Sasha was just
teaching me some lifts.

33:01.678 --> 33:04.115
True?

33:04.147 --> 33:07.217
How nice of you to
help our guest, Sasha.

33:17.795 --> 33:20.264
Hey, ladies. Is that us?

33:20.297 --> 33:23.200
-No, thanks.
-No, thanks.

33:23.232 --> 33:25.536
Sweet. Up to you.

33:25.568 --> 33:28.572
We're going for a
feed. Burger time.

33:30.740 --> 33:33.544
Bro, they so want this.
-You've got issues.

33:33.576 --> 33:36.247
Is everything all right at home?
-You know you want this, too.

33:37.580 --> 33:39.215
And that's why you're single.

33:39.249 --> 33:41.152
Aw, stop.

33:41.184 --> 33:43.220
Tu, is that us?

33:43.252 --> 33:45.389
Sure.

33:46.557 --> 33:48.325
Madison kept stepping on me.

33:48.357 --> 33:50.060
She's just not used to
dancing with hobbits.

33:50.094 --> 33:52.630
-Shut up.
-Nah. I'm sorry.

33:52.663 --> 33:54.065
I'm sorry.

33:54.097 --> 33:57.067
So, do you guys, like,
go out or something?

33:57.101 --> 34:00.071
No. She's my sister.

34:00.104 --> 34:02.472
-Shane.
-Don't worry, "G."

34:02.506 --> 34:04.075
I used to think they
were dating, too.

34:04.107 --> 34:07.278
Bro, I thought she was
totally out of your league.

34:07.310 --> 34:10.280
Can you not be awkward?

34:10.313 --> 34:11.414
Hey, 'cause you're
pretty all right.

34:11.447 --> 34:13.516
No, really. Just stop.

34:14.550 --> 34:16.186
So, how'd it go with brant?

34:16.219 --> 34:18.487
It was tough, man.

34:18.521 --> 34:19.856
I mean, I hit him
with my best stuff,

34:19.889 --> 34:21.858
but if I couldn't
make it look K-crew,

34:21.891 --> 34:24.194
then he doesn't want
to know about it.

34:24.228 --> 34:27.565
I mean, you're the ish
and everybody knows it.

34:27.597 --> 34:33.237
-And if we can't dance like
them, then chk, chk, chk, chk...

34:33.268 --> 34:35.505
Get the K-crew cut.

34:53.489 --> 34:55.425
I'm not a stalker or anything.

34:55.458 --> 34:57.127
I just saw the lights on.

34:57.161 --> 34:59.730
It's all good.

35:01.164 --> 35:02.867
Working on something new?

35:02.900 --> 35:05.536
No, just conditioning.

35:08.204 --> 35:09.472
Hey, we all good earlier?

35:09.505 --> 35:11.307
I hope I didn't get
you in trouble with...

35:11.340 --> 35:12.876
No, no.

35:12.909 --> 35:14.878
It's totally my fault.

35:14.911 --> 35:16.880
Kane doesn't really
like us messing around

35:16.914 --> 35:17.882
during rehearsals.

35:17.914 --> 35:20.884
It's all right to have
a little bit of fun.

35:20.918 --> 35:23.221
Yeah.

35:27.224 --> 35:28.159
You hungry?

35:28.192 --> 35:29.693
Starving.

35:37.333 --> 35:39.736
Welcome to my home.

35:39.769 --> 35:42.338
Far out.

35:42.371 --> 35:44.841
You sure your olds
won't be mad I'm here?

35:44.875 --> 35:48.344
No. Dad's in China for business,

35:48.378 --> 35:50.347
and mom still lives in New York.

35:50.380 --> 35:53.184
So you got this whole
place to yourself.

35:53.217 --> 35:54.652
Pretty much.

35:54.684 --> 35:57.820
I hope quinoa salad's okay.

35:57.853 --> 35:59.789
Sounds good.

36:05.429 --> 36:07.231
How is it?

36:08.264 --> 36:09.266
Yum.

36:09.298 --> 36:11.668
You liar.

36:14.237 --> 36:17.340
Hey, can I ask you something?

36:17.373 --> 36:20.743
Sure.

36:20.777 --> 36:24.548
Do you ever ask yourself
if it's worth it?

36:24.581 --> 36:26.650
If what's worth it?

36:26.682 --> 36:32.422
All the things that we
do to win, to be the best.

36:32.456 --> 36:34.258
Of course it's worth it.

36:34.291 --> 36:37.294
Why?

36:37.327 --> 36:40.598
'Cause dance is everything.

36:40.630 --> 36:42.333
To dance with the best.

36:42.365 --> 36:46.269
Man, I'd do anything to
be in K-crew with you.

36:46.302 --> 36:47.804
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

36:47.838 --> 36:50.407
I'd be living the dream.

36:50.440 --> 36:51.742
I don't know about dream.

36:51.775 --> 36:54.811
Hey, beats joining the army.

36:54.844 --> 36:57.947
The army?

36:57.981 --> 36:59.817
Dad's thing.

36:59.849 --> 37:01.418
Family tradition.

37:01.451 --> 37:02.552
Sucks.

37:02.585 --> 37:04.588
And your mom?

37:07.456 --> 37:09.592
She's not around anymore.

37:09.626 --> 37:11.394
This your mom?

37:11.427 --> 37:14.330
She's the real deal.

37:14.364 --> 37:18.269
Yeah, well, she's only agreed
to this whole hip-hop phase

37:18.302 --> 37:22.273
'cause K-crew's doing so well.

37:22.306 --> 37:25.675
Second we stop winning...

37:30.514 --> 37:32.449
You sure I can't take you home?

37:32.481 --> 37:33.851
Yeah.

37:33.884 --> 37:36.987
'Cause you're driving
all wrong for a 'cuda.

37:37.019 --> 37:37.887
Really?

37:37.920 --> 37:41.991
Yep. You got to roll
the windows down.

37:45.896 --> 37:49.000
-Check.
-And you got to ride low.

37:52.969 --> 37:54.338
Like this?

37:54.371 --> 37:56.573
No. Like this.

38:04.780 --> 38:07.784
And you got to
turn the music up.

38:09.585 --> 38:11.521
What's up?

38:11.554 --> 38:15.525
Don't judge me.

38:15.559 --> 38:17.827
You got to pump it.

38:17.860 --> 38:19.529
I wouldn't want
to embarrass you.

38:19.563 --> 38:21.331
I don't know
anybody around here.

38:21.364 --> 38:24.334
Turn it up, turn it up.

38:24.367 --> 38:26.869
<i>That somebody loves you</i>

38:26.902 --> 38:32.608
<i>Somebody thinks you
got a halo above you</i>

38:32.641 --> 38:34.510
<i>He thinks you're wonderful</i>

38:34.543 --> 38:36.480
<i>He thinks you're beautiful</i>

38:36.512 --> 38:40.483
<i>In everything you do</i>

38:40.516 --> 38:41.951
<i>Somebody loves you</i>

38:41.985 --> 38:44.421
<i>He wants to tell you
every time you're near</i>

38:44.454 --> 38:47.624
We can't.

38:47.657 --> 38:51.528
<i>Somebody loves you</i>

38:51.561 --> 38:54.431
<i>Somebody loves you</i>

38:54.463 --> 38:55.865
<i>He's right here</i>

38:55.898 --> 38:57.534
I know.

39:10.646 --> 39:11.981
Auger broke.

39:12.014 --> 39:13.583
I opened it up and
already clocked you in.

39:13.617 --> 39:16.721
Move your ass!

39:20.090 --> 39:23.460
Thanks.

39:23.492 --> 39:26.364
I won't be long.

39:46.483 --> 39:48.585
Hey, sorry about last night.

39:48.617 --> 39:50.755
We're gonna be late.

39:58.494 --> 40:00.431
How we all feeling?

40:00.463 --> 40:03.800
Hey, congrats on
making it this far.

40:03.833 --> 40:05.768
But this is just the beginning.

40:05.802 --> 40:07.971
We're going up a level.

40:08.003 --> 40:11.141
We're doing three days a week.

40:11.173 --> 40:12.509
-Sweet?
-Yeah.

40:12.541 --> 40:15.179
Pair up.

40:19.715 --> 40:22.886
Tu, you're with me.

40:29.025 --> 40:31.061
I just want you to
be honest with me.

40:31.094 --> 40:32.095
What's up?

40:32.128 --> 40:34.230
Are you still serious
about being in my crew?

40:34.264 --> 40:35.632
Of course I am.

40:35.664 --> 40:37.967
Then, why are you holding back?

40:38.001 --> 40:39.570
Well, most of my moves
aren't your style.

40:39.603 --> 40:43.173
True. Your moves
are messy as hell.

40:43.206 --> 40:44.740
I could fix it.

40:44.773 --> 40:46.710
It just looks like you
don't want to dance with us.

40:46.742 --> 40:49.947
-What? No. I do.
-I get it.

40:49.980 --> 40:53.916
You see my nice ride,
my private studio.

40:53.949 --> 40:57.053
You think I come from money?

40:57.086 --> 41:03.092
Bro, I come from pommy,
straight-up ghetto trash.

41:03.126 --> 41:06.163
I know what it's like
to come from nothing.

41:06.195 --> 41:09.766
Everything I have now
i got from dancing.

41:09.798 --> 41:13.737
And I got it 'cause I'm all-in.

41:13.769 --> 41:16.806
-So what if I go all
-in but it's not enough?

41:16.840 --> 41:18.608
That's on you.

41:18.641 --> 41:24.981
But if you don't go all-in,
I'll cut you... tonight.

41:25.014 --> 41:27.083
Tu, you're a solid dancer,

41:27.117 --> 41:29.286
and I really want you
to make it into K-crew.

41:29.318 --> 41:32.788
-Tell me what to do, then.
-Bring your "a" game.

41:32.822 --> 41:34.925
So when do we start?

42:09.125 --> 42:11.262
Hey.

42:22.237 --> 42:22.871
What did he say?

42:22.905 --> 42:26.576
Well, what did you guys do?

42:26.610 --> 42:28.077
-You're so his favorite.
-You're so his favorite.

42:28.110 --> 42:29.278
-Clue us up.
-Clue us up.

42:29.311 --> 42:32.114
Whoa, sis. Let the man breathe.

42:32.148 --> 42:35.018
No, but honest,
what did Kane want?

42:35.050 --> 42:37.721
Nothing. He just wanted to talk.

42:37.753 --> 42:39.589
So you guys just talked?

42:39.623 --> 42:41.724
-Jammed a little set.
-Hey!

42:41.757 --> 42:44.894
-What?
-So he danced with you?

42:44.927 --> 42:47.263
He wants me to come up
with a K-crew style set

42:47.297 --> 42:49.632
-and show him next time.
-Sweet!

42:49.666 --> 42:50.701
So at least one of us is in.

42:50.733 --> 42:52.168
The way I see it,

42:52.202 --> 42:54.738
the best dancers they could
pick are standing right here.

42:54.771 --> 42:55.739
That's right!

42:55.771 --> 42:58.741
-Yo!
-Yo!

42:58.775 --> 43:02.679
-K-crew!
-K-crew!

43:12.789 --> 43:15.826
<i>She must be some girl to have
you dancing in the street.</i>

43:15.858 --> 43:17.293
You're out late.

43:19.929 --> 43:21.798
I got the scholarship.

43:21.831 --> 43:23.400
Straight up?

43:23.432 --> 43:25.635
-For real?
-For real.

43:25.668 --> 43:27.003
I'm going to uni.

43:27.036 --> 43:28.638
That's mean, Von!

43:28.672 --> 43:29.972
-Yeah?
-Hell yeah!

43:30.005 --> 43:31.674
I always knew you'd crack it.

43:31.708 --> 43:32.776
Yeah, I know you did.

43:32.809 --> 43:34.177
And you never listen to me.

43:34.210 --> 43:36.746
Yeah, 'cause most of
what you say is stupid.

43:41.217 --> 43:42.919
You know that means I'll
have to leave the crew

43:42.952 --> 43:44.755
when school starts.

43:44.788 --> 43:46.690
You'll be around for regionals.

43:46.722 --> 43:50.793
Yeah, but after that...

43:50.827 --> 43:53.664
I'm gonna tell the crew
at practice tomorrow.

43:59.802 --> 44:01.737
Go to bed, loser.

44:01.771 --> 44:04.775
Whatever. You're the one
hanging around like a creep.

44:04.807 --> 44:08.144
Creep? Aw, shut up.

44:09.945 --> 44:10.980
'Night.

44:19.755 --> 44:21.157
You're home late.

44:21.190 --> 44:22.858
Again.

44:22.891 --> 44:24.160
Where've you been?

44:24.193 --> 44:25.829
Was out with the boys.

44:25.862 --> 44:28.331
You know, living it up
before I get shipped away.

44:28.364 --> 44:32.735
Well, you kids have
got to grow up someday?

44:32.768 --> 44:34.471
Yep.

44:34.503 --> 44:36.072
Get some sleep.

44:36.106 --> 44:37.774
We're up in four hours.

44:45.782 --> 44:49.186
Any luck hooking
some shore honeys?

44:49.219 --> 44:52.489
Bro, you can't stay
angry at me forever.

44:52.521 --> 44:54.458
I've got to go.

45:04.300 --> 45:05.402
You holding, G?

45:05.434 --> 45:06.737
Hey.

45:06.769 --> 45:09.806
Take one.

45:09.838 --> 45:11.842
-How much?
-Just $20.

45:11.875 --> 45:13.710
Sweet.

45:16.478 --> 45:18.013
Got any mates?

45:18.047 --> 45:19.782
Yep.

45:19.815 --> 45:21.050
Got some mates downtown

45:21.083 --> 45:22.786
who might want to
have a word with you.

45:22.818 --> 45:23.920
Aw, shit!

45:23.952 --> 45:24.987
Hey!

45:25.021 --> 45:26.823
Against the wall!

45:26.856 --> 45:29.092
Get off me!

45:29.125 --> 45:32.027
Benjy tuhoro,
you're under arrest!

45:47.010 --> 45:49.980
Love you! Whoo!

45:56.485 --> 45:59.322
Hey, look at him.

46:21.844 --> 46:24.413
-Love you!
-Yeah, boy!

46:26.081 --> 46:27.850
I'm gonna go.

46:27.884 --> 46:29.586
All right.

46:29.619 --> 46:31.021
See you later, all right?

46:31.054 --> 46:32.422
Bye.

46:32.454 --> 46:34.857
Bye, babe.

46:36.860 --> 46:38.061
Hey.

46:38.094 --> 46:40.931
Twins all good?

46:40.963 --> 46:43.266
Gadarthy got cut.

46:43.298 --> 46:46.269
Bro, it could be
any one of us next.

46:49.639 --> 46:50.841
You look terrible.

46:50.873 --> 46:53.375
Bro, I can't even.

46:53.409 --> 46:54.611
What is it?

46:54.643 --> 46:57.580
What's up?

46:57.614 --> 47:00.851
It's just a lot of pressure,

47:00.884 --> 47:02.952
I need to get into K-crew.

47:02.985 --> 47:05.855
If it's too far from karae,
you should just stay up here.

47:05.889 --> 47:07.557
We have a spare room.

47:07.590 --> 47:08.625
All good, bro.

47:08.657 --> 47:12.228
I got to get home, got
to keep my old man happy,

47:12.262 --> 47:16.633
keep my boss happy,
keep my crew happy.

47:16.666 --> 47:19.001
You still jam with 2pk?

47:19.034 --> 47:22.038
Well, I didn't know if this
was gonna be locked down.

47:22.070 --> 47:24.940
And I didn't want to piss
them off over nothing.

47:24.974 --> 47:26.409
All of us left our crews.

47:26.442 --> 47:28.945
This is Kane's national team.

47:31.547 --> 47:33.650
I know, man.

47:33.682 --> 47:36.186
And it's only Tuesday.

47:36.219 --> 47:37.987
It's Wednesday.

47:38.021 --> 47:39.289
Man, I've got to go.

47:39.322 --> 47:42.925
-See you tomorrow.
-If Vonnie hasn't killed me!

47:45.494 --> 47:49.065
Von. Sorry. I got mixed
up. I'm coming now.

47:49.097 --> 47:49.931
Practice is canceled anyway.

47:49.965 --> 47:51.567
That's why I was
trying to call you.

47:51.601 --> 47:53.670
What? Why?

47:53.702 --> 47:56.038
Benjy got arrested.

47:58.141 --> 47:59.909
We're at the warehouse.

47:59.943 --> 48:01.678
Hurry up.

48:11.086 --> 48:12.289
What's the haps, man?

48:12.322 --> 48:14.024
What are you on about?

48:14.056 --> 48:16.692
You, being late for practice.
You were a no-show today.

48:16.726 --> 48:17.827
I've been working, man.

48:17.860 --> 48:19.962
Ceejay said that you've
been leaving early for weeks.

48:19.996 --> 48:22.932
Bro, regionals are
almost here, and you're blowing...

48:22.965 --> 48:24.967
Blowing us off for some
girl on the north shore!

48:25.001 --> 48:26.970
I thought this crew meant
more to you than that.

48:27.003 --> 48:28.939
Bro, not even.

48:28.972 --> 48:31.374
Then what?

48:31.407 --> 48:35.946
I've been... trying out...

48:35.978 --> 48:37.146
For K-crew.

48:37.179 --> 48:38.547
-What?!
-K-crew?!

48:38.581 --> 48:40.617
-Hey! Hey!
-Chill! Chill! Chill!

48:40.650 --> 48:42.352
-"G."
-"G," get off me, man!

48:42.385 --> 48:44.254
I still want to dance with
you if I don't make it!

48:44.286 --> 48:46.622
What?! So we're
you're second choice?

48:46.655 --> 48:48.291
-No.
-Your side crew, is it?

48:48.324 --> 48:49.960
-I just...
-Just what?!

48:49.992 --> 48:51.360
I'm nearly there!

48:51.393 --> 48:53.128
I only have to make it
through one more practice

48:53.161 --> 48:54.163
without getting cut!

48:54.197 --> 48:55.632
So we're just supposed to wait?

48:55.664 --> 48:57.634
Bro, who do you think
you are? Like, honestly.

48:57.666 --> 48:58.735
Benjy's out,

48:58.768 --> 49:01.103
and you think you can just
waste our time like that?

49:01.137 --> 49:02.005
You have to choose.

49:02.038 --> 49:05.208
<i>Vonnie... you guys are my crew.</i>

49:05.240 --> 49:07.476
So you choose us?

49:13.048 --> 49:15.117
No.

49:23.425 --> 49:25.728
Tu, don't you dare
leave us like that.

49:25.762 --> 49:28.164
-What do you want from me?!
-Why didn't you tell me?

49:28.197 --> 49:29.666
'Cause you'd have
talked me out of it!

49:29.699 --> 49:31.134
What?

49:31.166 --> 49:32.335
I'm not like you, okay?

49:32.367 --> 49:34.304
I'm not smart. I'm
not going to uni!

49:34.336 --> 49:36.405
So, yeah, I saw a chance to
make something good of myself,

49:36.438 --> 49:38.574
-and I took it!
-Then why didn't you just leave?

49:38.608 --> 49:41.111
Why lie to us, make up
some girl on the shore?

49:41.143 --> 49:43.045
I didn't make her up!

49:43.079 --> 49:44.748
It's hard to explain.

49:44.780 --> 49:46.016
What do you even care?

49:46.048 --> 49:48.117
You're gone soon, anyway.

49:48.150 --> 49:49.786
'Cause I was gonna leave
you in charge of the crew,

49:49.818 --> 49:52.755
and I thought you
gave a damn about us.

50:12.775 --> 50:15.077
Hey!

50:15.110 --> 50:17.047
What're you doing here?

50:17.079 --> 50:18.447
Coming to work.

50:18.481 --> 50:20.350
You don't work here
anymore. You're fired.

50:20.382 --> 50:22.384
Give me your key.

50:22.418 --> 50:25.288
Benjy said he stole your key,

50:25.320 --> 50:27.089
copied it, swore
you weren't involved.

50:27.123 --> 50:29.326
Is that true?

50:34.197 --> 50:37.400
Whatever it is you're doing...

50:37.432 --> 50:39.735
Hope it's worth it.

50:45.273 --> 50:46.241
All right, listen up.

50:46.275 --> 50:48.677
Today's your last chance.

50:48.710 --> 50:51.146
Show me how much you want this.

50:51.179 --> 50:53.349
Pair up.

50:57.753 --> 51:00.757
Sasha, pair up.

51:04.527 --> 51:06.162
You know, if I make it,

51:06.195 --> 51:08.097
you have to start
talking to me again.

51:08.130 --> 51:09.798
Let's just dance.

51:09.831 --> 51:12.134
5, 6, 7...

51:16.572 --> 51:18.508
-What's wrong with you?
-Nothing.

51:18.541 --> 51:21.177
Then why are you
making me look bad?

51:21.210 --> 51:22.077
Today's my last chance!

51:22.110 --> 51:24.146
Tu, this is just a
friggin' dance crew.

51:24.179 --> 51:25.514
For you, maybe!

51:25.547 --> 51:28.584
My whole life depends on this!

51:28.617 --> 51:31.587
-Tu, I'm so sorry.
-No.

51:34.257 --> 51:37.094
Can I get another
partner, please?

51:39.795 --> 51:42.331
Run it from the top. 5, 6...

51:47.170 --> 51:48.771
How are things at work?

51:48.804 --> 51:51.240
It's too hard to say. You
know, same stuff every day.

51:51.273 --> 51:54.376
You think I don't know
what a lie looks like, boy?

51:54.409 --> 51:55.711
-What?
-Sarge...

51:55.744 --> 51:57.146
So you know nothing
about all that dope

51:57.179 --> 51:58.380
the cops found at
your work, then?

51:58.414 --> 52:00.182
I'm not doing any of that stuff.

52:00.215 --> 52:02.152
Straight up.

52:02.184 --> 52:03.318
I was on the shore all day.

52:03.351 --> 52:04.586
-Out there dealing?
-What? No.

52:04.619 --> 52:09.726
Just... give it to me straight.

52:09.759 --> 52:14.898
Tu kaea, what have
you been doing, son?

52:21.336 --> 52:24.407
Dancing.

52:24.440 --> 52:26.576
I'm one of the
final five in tryouts

52:26.608 --> 52:28.577
to join the best hip-hop
crew in New Zealand.

52:28.610 --> 52:30.346
You're joking, right?

52:30.378 --> 52:31.847
This is it for me.

52:31.880 --> 52:33.750
This is my break.

52:38.653 --> 52:41.757
And what happens if
they don't take you?

52:44.260 --> 52:46.663
What are your plans, son?

52:49.599 --> 52:53.269
They'll take me, dad.

52:53.302 --> 52:55.405
They'll take me.

52:59.574 --> 53:02.545
Move it.

54:07.610 --> 54:10.012
It's good. From the top.

54:14.317 --> 54:17.621
All I can say is that this
is a really hard decision.

54:19.722 --> 54:23.827
You're all mean dancers, but
K-crew can't take you all.

54:24.960 --> 54:27.998
When I call your name, come up.

54:30.333 --> 54:32.402
Sasha.

54:37.005 --> 54:39.341
Brent.

54:43.478 --> 54:45.614
Madison.

54:49.418 --> 54:51.421
Sophie.

54:55.958 --> 54:57.927
Conrad.

55:01.130 --> 55:03.365
Jules.

55:10.438 --> 55:12.574
That leaves one more, right?

55:24.387 --> 55:26.456
Andrew.

55:32.460 --> 55:33.895
Congrats, guys.

55:33.929 --> 55:37.901
Everyone else...

55:39.101 --> 55:40.903
Wait.

55:40.936 --> 55:43.539
That's just last year's crew.

55:44.974 --> 55:47.076
Yeah, it is.

55:47.108 --> 55:50.045
Thanks. You can go.

56:02.023 --> 56:03.592
Tu! Tu, wait!

56:03.626 --> 56:04.761
What was that?!

56:04.793 --> 56:06.996
What were you guys
doing in there?

56:07.028 --> 56:11.800
All I saw were you guys
doing my set, my moves.

56:11.833 --> 56:14.469
<i>Well, technically,
they're our moves now.</i>

56:14.503 --> 56:15.538
-What?!
-Tu!

56:15.570 --> 56:19.074
-Stop! Hey! Wait!
-We were never going to get in.

56:19.108 --> 56:22.111
They just wanted
to steal our sets.

56:22.143 --> 56:23.512
I'm a winner.

56:23.545 --> 56:25.814
I win at all costs.

56:25.847 --> 56:28.483
Something you should learn.

56:28.516 --> 56:30.118
Babe, let's go.

56:30.152 --> 56:32.521
Be right there.

56:35.123 --> 56:39.528
Later, freaks.

56:39.561 --> 56:40.762
How long did you know?

56:40.795 --> 56:43.098
-Tu...
-How long?

56:43.132 --> 56:45.568
I didn't mean for any
of this to happen, but...

56:45.601 --> 56:46.803
But what?

56:46.835 --> 56:49.538
You were having too much
fun in your flash car

56:49.572 --> 56:50.940
and your flash bloody mansion,

56:50.972 --> 56:52.507
laughing with
your stuck-up mates

56:52.541 --> 56:55.745
about how you would trick...

56:55.777 --> 56:57.179
You tricked me.

56:57.213 --> 57:00.149
That's not fair.

57:00.181 --> 57:03.485
You tricked me into
thinking I had a chance.

57:03.518 --> 57:07.189
-No, I just... I have to figure
some things out, okay?

57:07.222 --> 57:09.858
It's too late for that.

57:27.675 --> 57:29.077
Yo.

57:37.519 --> 57:38.820
Hey.

57:38.853 --> 57:41.590
You surprised me.

57:41.623 --> 57:43.625
Just came to check on my girl.

57:45.628 --> 57:46.829
Hey, what's wrong?

57:46.862 --> 57:50.633
What are we doing?

57:50.666 --> 57:53.035
What it takes.

57:53.068 --> 57:54.670
It's wrong.

57:54.702 --> 57:56.739
This is so wrong, Kane.

57:56.771 --> 57:58.139
Are you questioning
how I run my crew?

57:58.172 --> 58:02.611
-No, I just...
-You just... what?

58:02.644 --> 58:04.614
Think you could do a better job?

58:04.646 --> 58:06.114
I didn't say that.

58:06.148 --> 58:08.784
I took a huge risk
letting you in my crew.

58:08.817 --> 58:15.257
You had no hip-hop
experience, no rep, no chance.

58:15.291 --> 58:17.527
But now look at you.

58:17.559 --> 58:21.530
People know your name,
girls want to be you,

58:21.563 --> 58:23.832
guys want to date you.

58:23.865 --> 58:26.869
I made you a winner.

58:31.706 --> 58:37.612
Now, we both know what happens
when you stop winning, right?

58:37.646 --> 58:40.583
You go home.

58:40.615 --> 58:43.286
I don't want you to go home.

58:43.318 --> 58:45.654
Do you?

58:45.688 --> 58:47.722
No.

58:47.755 --> 58:50.826
Then be a good girl.

58:50.858 --> 58:53.161
Keep winning.

01:00:30.958 --> 01:00:32.060
Hey, loser.

01:00:32.094 --> 01:00:34.063
What do you want?

01:00:38.467 --> 01:00:40.135
I didn't make it?

01:00:42.838 --> 01:00:45.408
It was all a lie.

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:46.975
They lied to me.

01:00:47.009 --> 01:00:49.746
To bite our moves.

01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:55.985
Forget it.

01:00:56.018 --> 01:00:57.753
Have fun at uni!

01:00:57.786 --> 01:00:58.820
Tu.

01:00:58.853 --> 01:01:01.756
Bro, drop the act and harden up.

01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:03.025
So you didn't get asked to dance

01:01:03.057 --> 01:01:05.927
with some rich
kids from the shore.

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:07.096
They were my only shot!

01:01:07.128 --> 01:01:08.329
No, no, no, no, no.

01:01:08.362 --> 01:01:11.766
Bro, you're all
wrong. Look at me.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.269
<i>You are your shot.
You don't need them.</i>

01:01:14.302 --> 01:01:16.871
They needed you.

01:01:16.905 --> 01:01:19.975
If they're so stale they've got
to bite other people's moves,

01:01:20.007 --> 01:01:22.110
they already know
they're on the way out.

01:01:22.143 --> 01:01:24.012
But you?

01:01:24.045 --> 01:01:30.118
Tu, you got nowhere
to go but up.

01:01:30.152 --> 01:01:32.288
-Thanks, Von.
-Whatevs.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.922
Just remember Benjy's in jail

01:01:33.956 --> 01:01:36.892
for being even more of
a loser than you are.

01:01:36.925 --> 01:01:39.461
Go and see him, loser.

01:01:42.864 --> 01:01:44.733
It's not that bad.

01:01:44.766 --> 01:01:47.469
Great TV.

01:01:47.503 --> 01:01:48.805
Whatever.

01:01:48.838 --> 01:01:52.775
I'm out on probation in a week.
I ain't never coming back here.

01:01:52.807 --> 01:01:54.744
Thanks for not narcing on me.

01:01:54.777 --> 01:01:59.115
Bro, I put myself in here.

01:01:59.148 --> 01:02:01.217
And what am I gonna do?

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:04.920
Bring you down with me?

01:02:04.952 --> 01:02:08.056
We're all looking
for a way up, cuz.

01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:11.794
I just looked in
the wrong place.

01:02:11.827 --> 01:02:12.928
Yeah, me too.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:15.463
Bro, you're a mean dancer.

01:02:15.496 --> 01:02:16.697
K-crew didn't think so.

01:02:16.731 --> 01:02:20.769
Hey, k-crew know you're one of
the best dancers in the city.

01:02:20.802 --> 01:02:25.007
That's why they scammed
you all in the first place.

01:02:27.275 --> 01:02:31.379
Benjy, you're a genius!

01:02:32.347 --> 01:02:34.784
Thanks, bro!

01:02:36.018 --> 01:02:38.420
What did I say?

01:02:42.123 --> 01:02:44.125
-Hey.
-Yo, what's up?

01:02:44.159 --> 01:02:46.028
-How are you?
-Good.

01:02:46.061 --> 01:02:47.363
What's up, brother?

01:02:47.396 --> 01:02:48.898
-Hey, what's up?
-Hey, what's up?

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:50.298
-Welcome to kuda.
-How are you?

01:02:50.331 --> 01:02:53.902
-You guys are here, so I'm guessing all
-in.

01:02:53.936 --> 01:02:55.938
Well...

01:02:55.971 --> 01:02:57.840
Five isn't enough for a crew.

01:02:57.873 --> 01:03:00.075
Well, good thing I called
some mates to come help out.

01:03:01.610 --> 01:03:04.413
-Look, there they are.
-Easy, tiger.

01:03:04.445 --> 01:03:06.481
Nah, I'm over twins, man.

01:03:06.514 --> 01:03:08.016
Double the trouble.

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:09.385
-I know the south side ones.
-Hey, guys!

01:03:09.418 --> 01:03:10.385
Hey!

01:03:10.418 --> 01:03:12.153
My gosh, I haven't
seen you in so long!

01:03:12.186 --> 01:03:15.223
-Hey, how are you?
-Good.

01:03:15.257 --> 01:03:17.893
Look, it's a nice idea, but...

01:03:17.925 --> 01:03:19.295
They took all of our best sets.

01:03:19.327 --> 01:03:22.197
Our meanest choreography.

01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:24.934
They took our
best K-crew style.

01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:27.369
K-crew dance 'cause
it's what they do.

01:03:27.402 --> 01:03:29.838
But we dance 'cause
it's who we are.

01:03:29.871 --> 01:03:32.106
When was the last time you
guys danced just to dance?

01:03:32.139 --> 01:03:33.541
It's a celebration

01:03:33.574 --> 01:03:36.945
people, get your drinks up

01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:50.425
hey. How you doing?

01:03:50.458 --> 01:03:53.161
Call me.

01:04:00.434 --> 01:04:03.038
I'm finna let it, finna
let it, finna let it go

01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:16.552
yeah, girls.

01:04:20.088 --> 01:04:22.423
<i>O-original, original</i>

01:04:22.456 --> 01:04:23.958
<i>You know I'm original</i>

01:04:23.992 --> 01:04:25.294
<i>We feelin' the floor</i>

01:04:25.327 --> 01:04:26.996
<i>I know you're feelin the floor</i>

01:04:27.028 --> 01:04:29.231
<i>I never did this before,
when I'm killin' the floor</i>

01:04:29.264 --> 01:04:30.966
<i>I said I reel in the dough</i>

01:04:30.998 --> 01:04:33.101
<i>You know I reel in the dough
and I'm stealin' the show</i>

01:04:33.135 --> 01:04:34.470
<i>That's right, I'm
stealing the show</i>

01:04:34.503 --> 01:04:35.938
<i>That's why they feelin' the show</i>

01:04:35.971 --> 01:04:38.407
<i>I got good energy
in all of my chakras</i>

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:40.409
<i>Kickin' all the
bitches like soccer</i>

01:04:40.442 --> 01:04:42.311
<i>Doin' it till
death of my partners</i>

01:04:42.344 --> 01:04:44.480
<i>We gon' keep up but
they callin' us monsters</i>

01:04:44.512 --> 01:04:46.315
<i>I got superstars
all up in my roster</i>

01:04:46.347 --> 01:04:48.516
<i>Shakin' off all of the imposters</i>

01:04:48.550 --> 01:04:49.952
<i>You know I bring the
fire like a roster</i>

01:04:49.985 --> 01:04:51.287
<i>You a hater, see ya later</i>

01:04:51.285 --> 01:04:51.285
<i>Bye</i>

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.454
<i>'Cause I lost ya</i>

01:04:52.487 --> 01:04:54.322
<i>Bong, bong, bong, bong</i>

01:04:54.356 --> 01:04:56.392
<i>They gon' be like,
"this my song"</i>

01:04:56.425 --> 01:04:59.295
<i>Send a shout to my deejay</i>

01:04:59.327 --> 01:05:01.362
<i>We gonna party all night long</i>

01:05:01.396 --> 01:05:03.298
<i>Bong, bong, bong, bong</i>

01:05:03.331 --> 01:05:05.333
<i>They gon' be like,
"this my song"</i>

01:05:05.367 --> 01:05:07.269
<i>Diggy, diggy,
da-diggy-diggy-da</i>

01:05:07.302 --> 01:05:11.073
<i>Diggy, diggy, all night long</i>

01:05:11.106 --> 01:05:14.276
<i>Turn me up in my track
'cause I'm finna let it go</i>

01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:15.945
<i>I'm finna let it go</i>

01:05:15.978 --> 01:05:18.313
<i>I'm finna let it go,
I'm finna let it go</i>

01:05:18.347 --> 01:05:20.015
<i>I'm finna let it go</i>

01:05:20.047 --> 01:05:22.216
<i>I'm finna let it go,
I'm finna let it go</i>

01:05:29.090 --> 01:05:32.126
How does it feel not
to be a dick anymore?

01:05:33.094 --> 01:05:34.596
Pretty good?

01:05:37.365 --> 01:05:39.701
You think our crews can
make it to nationals?

01:05:39.735 --> 01:05:42.104
-It's my last chance, so I'm going all
-out.

01:05:42.137 --> 01:05:43.605
You always do.

01:05:43.637 --> 01:05:46.741
Yeah, I do, I do.

01:05:59.253 --> 01:06:01.990
To the freaks,
the freaks, freaks!

01:06:04.126 --> 01:06:05.594
Of course, K-crew...

01:06:05.626 --> 01:06:06.628
Yeah!

01:06:06.661 --> 01:06:09.664
They're off for the
nationals once again.

01:06:09.697 --> 01:06:11.632
<i>We cruisin', we rollin'</i>

01:06:11.666 --> 01:06:13.001
<i>But when we hit the scene,</i>

01:06:13.034 --> 01:06:15.269
<i>Best believe we gonna go it</i>

01:06:15.302 --> 01:06:16.605
<i>Number-one girl in the game</i>

01:06:16.637 --> 01:06:18.139
<i>White man think they
gonna bring flame</i>

01:06:18.172 --> 01:06:19.273
<i>Boy, what's your claim to fame?</i>

01:06:19.306 --> 01:06:20.575
All right, give it up, guys!

01:06:20.608 --> 01:06:22.411
Yeah, give it up!

01:06:22.443 --> 01:06:25.146
Advancing to the nationals...

01:06:25.179 --> 01:06:26.248
2pk!

01:06:33.454 --> 01:06:35.690
Set it off, set it off,
don't bust your head

01:06:35.724 --> 01:06:39.461
five, six, seven eight. One,
two, three four, five, six.

01:06:39.494 --> 01:06:41.130
Yo, yo!

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:43.498
You guys need to
check this, man.

01:06:43.532 --> 01:06:46.235
Freaks made it
through regionals.

01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:48.336
They're gonna be at nationals.

01:06:54.342 --> 01:06:56.177
They're nothing.

01:06:56.210 --> 01:06:58.680
Back to work.

01:07:11.092 --> 01:07:12.760
He's not home.

01:07:12.793 --> 01:07:15.096
Excuse me?

01:07:15.130 --> 01:07:18.200
It's Sasha, right?

01:07:18.233 --> 01:07:19.802
You must be Vonnie.

01:07:19.835 --> 01:07:21.537
Yeah, and you must be dumb if
you think Tu wants to see you

01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:23.105
after what you did to him.

01:07:23.137 --> 01:07:25.074
Look, I know you guys are close.

01:07:25.106 --> 01:07:26.641
He's my best friend.

01:07:26.675 --> 01:07:29.278
You used him, you lied to
him, and you stole from him.

01:07:29.311 --> 01:07:31.180
I know what I did was wrong.

01:07:31.213 --> 01:07:34.083
But I really do care about Tu.

01:07:34.115 --> 01:07:35.684
Funny way of showing it.

01:07:35.717 --> 01:07:36.585
Is he okay?

01:07:36.617 --> 01:07:39.654
He's tough. He's
always gonna be okay.

01:07:40.554 --> 01:07:42.190
Look, if you really
care about Tu,

01:07:42.224 --> 01:07:45.561
then leave him alone and let
him focus on nationals tomorrow.

01:07:45.594 --> 01:07:49.164
Can you just please
tell him that I was here?

01:07:49.197 --> 01:07:50.800
Yeah, whatever.

01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.382
Who's that?

01:08:07.414 --> 01:08:10.184
Just somebody after Tu.

01:08:10.217 --> 01:08:11.586
What's the boy done now?

01:08:11.619 --> 01:08:14.690
Don't tell me it's this
dance rubbish, either.

01:08:14.722 --> 01:08:15.824
Don't you know?

01:08:15.856 --> 01:08:18.127
Know what?

01:08:19.828 --> 01:08:22.631
What's this?

01:08:22.662 --> 01:08:27.135
Your son.

01:08:27.167 --> 01:08:30.270
He's hit over 800,000 views.

01:08:58.631 --> 01:09:02.270
What's up, bitches?

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:06.274
Look what you did.

01:09:11.947 --> 01:09:13.680
Von!

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:23.457
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be at work?

01:09:23.490 --> 01:09:25.194
Can't a father
give his son a lift

01:09:25.225 --> 01:09:26.493
on the biggest day of his life?

01:09:26.528 --> 01:09:29.532
Can you hurry up?
We're gonna be late.

01:09:32.934 --> 01:09:34.636
Seriously?

01:09:36.371 --> 01:09:38.738
Moving.

01:09:38.773 --> 01:09:39.875
Where's Tu?

01:09:39.908 --> 01:09:41.910
He should be here.

01:09:41.943 --> 01:09:43.679
-There he is.
-Tu! Hey!

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:45.714
-Hey, Tu!
-What's up, G?

01:09:45.747 --> 01:09:47.316
What's up? My gosh.

01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:49.716
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

01:09:57.958 --> 01:10:00.261
Sarge.

01:10:00.295 --> 01:10:02.398
Dad.

01:10:17.279 --> 01:10:18.780
You got this.

01:10:18.813 --> 01:10:20.748
Go.

01:10:52.413 --> 01:10:55.050
Auckland city, are you ready?

01:10:55.984 --> 01:11:00.355
I said, Auckland
city, are you ready?!

01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:06.427
Give it up for Steve grey!

01:11:06.461 --> 01:11:10.298
Lauren dunningham!

01:11:10.332 --> 01:11:15.604
And my man, Gandalf
Archer-mills!

01:11:15.636 --> 01:11:18.673
In our first battle, we
have last year's winners.

01:11:18.707 --> 01:11:22.577
Please give it up for K-crew!

01:11:22.609 --> 01:11:27.014
Up against neon faction!

01:11:27.047 --> 01:11:29.318
Let the battle begin!

01:11:35.689 --> 01:11:37.525
<i>Breakin' all these hos</i>

01:11:37.559 --> 01:11:38.994
<i>Takin' names is why I'm doing it</i>

01:11:39.027 --> 01:11:40.662
<i>Calling all for the broads</i>

01:11:40.694 --> 01:11:41.929
<i>But the car got two in it</i>

01:11:41.962 --> 01:11:43.731
<i>Never downplay my greatness</i>

01:11:43.765 --> 01:11:45.534
<i>Don't do so 'cause
I'm provin' it</i>

01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:47.502
<i>My advice is revise your plan</i>

01:11:47.534 --> 01:11:49.371
<i>Whatever it is, I ruined it,
started with a dollar bill</i>

01:11:49.404 --> 01:11:51.340
<i>Won't stop till i
get a hundred mil</i>

01:11:51.372 --> 01:11:52.606
<i>Then I'll build to the top,
then I'll build from the nine</i>

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:54.810
<i>Brand-new wars that I got</i>

01:11:54.842 --> 01:11:56.877
<i>Then I prove to the
block hard top drop, drop</i>

01:11:56.911 --> 01:12:00.381
<i>Why waste time that
i really don't got?</i>

01:12:00.414 --> 01:12:02.717
<i>You feeling me now?</i>

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:05.119
<i>'Cause the lord is my witness</i>

01:12:05.153 --> 01:12:08.423
<i>He's the king,
get it high, get it</i>

01:12:08.456 --> 01:12:11.793
<i>I'm trying to make a
billion before I finish</i>

01:12:11.826 --> 01:12:14.029
<i>I'm trying to make a
billion before I finish</i>

01:12:14.061 --> 01:12:15.564
<i>Sho' nuff</i>

01:12:15.596 --> 01:12:17.932
<i>'Cause the lord is my witness</i>

01:12:17.966 --> 01:12:20.369
<i>He's the king,
get it high, get it</i>

01:12:20.402 --> 01:12:21.569
<i>Sho' nuff</i>

01:12:27.408 --> 01:12:30.112
Please give it up for K-crew!

01:12:44.591 --> 01:12:48.363
<i>Hey, yo</i>

01:13:41.483 --> 01:13:42.650
<i>Hey, yo</i>

01:13:44.485 --> 01:13:46.954
All right, judges, most
importantly right now

01:13:46.988 --> 01:13:50.192
we need to know
what do you think?

01:13:50.225 --> 01:13:51.693
It's K-crew!

01:13:51.725 --> 01:13:53.862
It's unanimous!

01:13:58.065 --> 01:14:01.603
So, we doing this or what?

01:14:02.737 --> 01:14:06.041
2pk against the freaks.

01:14:06.073 --> 01:14:08.576
-But what if this doesn't...
-Bro.

01:14:08.609 --> 01:14:10.578
It's too late for what ifs.

01:14:10.612 --> 01:14:12.180
That's us.

01:14:12.212 --> 01:14:16.717
We go hard, bro, no matter what.

01:14:16.751 --> 01:14:18.487
Represent.

01:14:23.224 --> 01:14:25.025
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

01:14:25.059 --> 01:14:26.828
the competition is heating up.

01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:32.266
Right about now, we're
gonna bring out 2pk!

01:14:34.269 --> 01:14:35.904
Give it up!

01:14:36.537 --> 01:14:39.673
Yeah, and they're
gonna be battling it out

01:14:39.707 --> 01:14:41.543
against... give it up, y'all...

01:14:41.576 --> 01:14:42.543
For the freaks!

01:14:46.581 --> 01:14:48.516
Yeah, this is what
I'm talking about.

01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:50.819
Y'all ready to get this started?

01:14:50.851 --> 01:14:53.622
I said y'all ready
to get this started?!

01:14:54.756 --> 01:14:58.827
Deejay, drop that beat!

01:14:58.859 --> 01:15:00.961
<i>Beat yourself down, down, yeah</i>

01:15:00.994 --> 01:15:02.663
<i>It's the remix</i>

01:15:02.697 --> 01:15:05.634
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

01:15:05.667 --> 01:15:07.736
<i>Beat yourself down, down, yeah</i>

01:15:07.769 --> 01:15:09.804
<i>It ain't good</i>

01:15:09.837 --> 01:15:11.306
<i>It ain't good
'cause you get your...</i>

01:15:11.338 --> 01:15:12.841
<i>I don't know anybody</i>

01:15:12.873 --> 01:15:14.542
<i>Y'all know what
this says... act right</i>

01:15:14.576 --> 01:15:16.077
<i>It's the kid coming up
next, what was on tap</i>

01:15:16.109 --> 01:15:17.711
<i>Rubbing off grass,
throwing off raps</i>

01:15:17.744 --> 01:15:19.213
<i>Off the hit skill
that'll crush cats</i>

01:15:19.247 --> 01:15:20.582
<i>But it's hard to spit
without coming off</i>

01:15:20.614 --> 01:15:21.815
<i>Never getting an assist</i>

01:15:21.849 --> 01:15:23.685
<i>Dropping off, never gonna sit</i>

01:15:23.717 --> 01:15:25.019
<i>Mouse running in cheddar
and get it all predicted</i>

01:15:25.052 --> 01:15:26.688
<i>So y'all never say</i>

01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:30.692
<i>'Cause the state won't give
me your words to play, y'all</i>

01:15:30.725 --> 01:15:31.893
<i>And I'll make your
pretties look thick</i>

01:15:31.926 --> 01:15:34.095
<i>Like you wrote it in crayon</i>

01:15:34.127 --> 01:15:35.663
<i>Let's go how many dudes you know</i>

01:15:35.697 --> 01:15:36.965
<i>Who float like this?</i>

01:15:36.997 --> 01:15:38.933
<i>How many dudes you know
who float like this?</i>

01:15:38.966 --> 01:15:40.067
<i>How many, if any?</i>

01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:41.902
<i>I don't know anybody</i>

01:15:41.935 --> 01:15:43.572
<i>Yo, scrumptious, so give it up</i>

01:15:43.604 --> 01:15:46.006
<i>And I put the Mike down when
i pick it up, I rip it up</i>

01:15:46.039 --> 01:15:47.641
<i>So don't miss it,
everybody want to hit it</i>

01:15:47.675 --> 01:15:49.978
<i>But y'all need to breathe,
'cause we're going on</i>

01:15:50.011 --> 01:15:51.613
<i>We refuse to leave,
you can't get rid of us</i>

01:15:51.645 --> 01:15:53.648
<i>Yo, if you think I'm on
drugs, please come in the club</i>

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.149
<i>And I'll be dancing by
myself like I don't give a...</i>

01:15:55.182 --> 01:15:57.152
<i>What, what, dropping
the Mike and let it flow</i>

01:15:57.185 --> 01:15:58.753
<i>If you drop it as you
go for the Liberty slow</i>

01:15:58.786 --> 01:16:00.755
<i>I'm hypothetical,
physically, whatever you know</i>

01:16:00.787 --> 01:16:02.356
<i>I got my rhyme packed
tight and I'm ready to go</i>

01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:04.159
<i>I made some mistakes in
the past that was yesterday</i>

01:16:11.064 --> 01:16:12.199
<i>Relax and take a breath, y'all</i>

01:16:12.233 --> 01:16:14.069
What the...

01:16:14.101 --> 01:16:15.836
<i>R-R-R-Relax and
take a breath, yo</i>

01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:21.009
<i>-Hell no.
-Let's go</i>

01:16:21.042 --> 01:16:22.644
<i>I'm here to stay, get
out, you're in the way</i>

01:16:22.676 --> 01:16:25.045
<i>Can I get a guess
so? Yes, yes, yo!</i>

01:16:25.078 --> 01:16:27.114
<i>Man, check it out</i>

01:16:27.148 --> 01:16:30.118
<i>Yo, check it out. Check it out</i>

01:16:30.150 --> 01:16:31.952
<i>Ain't no one like me</i>

01:16:31.985 --> 01:16:34.154
<i>Man, check it out</i>

01:16:34.188 --> 01:16:36.024
<i>Check it out, check it out</i>

01:16:36.056 --> 01:16:38.025
<i>Ain't no one like me, like me</i>

01:16:38.059 --> 01:16:40.128
<i>How many dudes you know
who float like this?</i>

01:16:40.161 --> 01:16:41.829
<i>How many dudes you know
who float like this?</i>

01:16:41.863 --> 01:16:43.664
<i>How many, if any?</i>

01:16:43.698 --> 01:16:45.233
<i>How many, if any?</i>

01:16:45.265 --> 01:16:47.034
<i>How many dudes you know
who got the skills to go</i>

01:16:47.068 --> 01:16:49.104
<i>And rock a show like this?</i>

01:16:50.671 --> 01:16:52.139
<i>I don't know anybody</i>

01:16:52.172 --> 01:16:54.376
<i>Please give it up for seven</i>

01:16:54.408 --> 01:16:55.876
Forget them.

01:16:55.909 --> 01:17:00.014
<i>Holy shit. Thank you very much</i>

01:17:00.047 --> 01:17:04.018
<i>Peace!</i>

01:17:10.057 --> 01:17:12.060
All right, for the
first time in history,

01:17:12.092 --> 01:17:14.429
it seems like two crews
have merged together.

01:17:14.462 --> 01:17:17.265
I don't know what the official
word is on that, judges.

01:17:17.297 --> 01:17:20.135
Seems like it's cool with
them. It's cool with me.

01:17:20.167 --> 01:17:24.038
All right, moving on
to the next round is...

01:17:24.072 --> 01:17:28.810
Make some noise for
the new crew, 2-freaky!

01:17:28.842 --> 01:17:31.246
Yeah!

01:17:31.279 --> 01:17:35.917
2-freaky, 2-freaky!

01:17:35.949 --> 01:17:38.853
Yeah, 2-freaky!

01:17:38.886 --> 01:17:42.658
Yeah, 2-freaky!

01:17:44.859 --> 01:17:48.163
Did you see their faces?

01:17:48.195 --> 01:17:50.899
Sniped them-stealth as.

01:17:50.931 --> 01:17:52.867
Nailed it, bro.

01:17:52.899 --> 01:17:54.835
Hold up. Hold up.

01:17:54.868 --> 01:17:56.938
We just took a risk.

01:17:56.970 --> 01:17:59.373
It paid off, but
if we can improve

01:17:59.407 --> 01:18:01.443
in more than just
a one-dance window,

01:18:01.475 --> 01:18:02.643
we have to bring it.

01:18:02.676 --> 01:18:06.246
Whoever we've got next is
gonna want it just as bad as us.

01:18:06.279 --> 01:18:09.083
So we'll take them down...
Then take K-crew down.

01:18:09.117 --> 01:18:10.752
Easy as.

01:18:10.784 --> 01:18:12.386
"Easy as"?

01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:15.824
Stolen moves aside,
K-crew's last hit was fire,

01:18:15.856 --> 01:18:17.324
and they just came on top.

01:18:17.358 --> 01:18:18.927
Forget them.

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:20.729
This isn't about them.

01:18:20.761 --> 01:18:25.299
It's about us working together
and making our own breaks.

01:18:25.332 --> 01:18:27.034
-Straight
-up.

01:18:27.068 --> 01:18:30.271
Let's take it one
round at a time?

01:18:30.304 --> 01:18:33.240
Bro, you know they
might actually do it?

01:18:33.274 --> 01:18:34.342
What?

01:18:34.375 --> 01:18:37.878
-Make it to finals.
-So what?!

01:18:37.912 --> 01:18:40.882
Are you scared?

01:18:40.914 --> 01:18:44.018
Do you remember the
last time we lost?

01:18:44.051 --> 01:18:47.288
'Cause I don't, either.

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:50.057
So we win today.

01:18:50.091 --> 01:18:52.227
No matter what.

01:19:00.534 --> 01:19:01.536
Aw, yeah.

01:19:01.569 --> 01:19:05.539
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have our final four!

01:19:06.707 --> 01:19:12.980
Of course, K-crew, infamous,
eminence, and 2-freaky!

01:19:13.014 --> 01:19:16.851
First up, though, we got
K-crew versus eminence.

01:19:16.884 --> 01:19:17.886
Let's go!

01:20:08.435 --> 01:20:13.607
Give it up for K-crew,
three-time world champions!

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:15.976
Whoo-whoo-whoo!

01:20:46.407 --> 01:20:49.377
<i>K-crew, smash up the place.</i>

01:20:54.047 --> 01:20:55.617
<i>K-crew.</i>

01:21:05.659 --> 01:21:09.997
All right, so, what
do our judges think?

01:21:10.030 --> 01:21:12.600
It's unanimous! K-crew!

01:21:12.632 --> 01:21:14.301
You're up next! Come
on, come on, come on!

01:21:14.335 --> 01:21:17.505
-Coming to the stage right about, 2
-freaky

01:21:17.537 --> 01:21:20.942
battling up against infamous!

01:21:20.975 --> 01:21:23.111
This is you going all-in?

01:21:25.212 --> 01:21:27.515
Too bad it won't be enough.

01:21:27.547 --> 01:21:29.149
Tu.

01:21:30.685 --> 01:21:31.953
Leave it.

01:21:31.985 --> 01:21:34.122
-You ready?
-Let's go.

01:21:34.154 --> 01:21:37.992
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

01:21:38.024 --> 01:21:39.092
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

01:21:40.594 --> 01:21:42.230
<i>I know y'all seein'
that we back again</i>

01:21:42.262 --> 01:21:44.032
<i>I know y'all seein'
that we back again</i>

01:21:44.064 --> 01:21:45.666
<i>I know y'all seein'
that we back again</i>

01:21:45.699 --> 01:21:47.135
<i>I know y'all, I know
y'all, I know y'all</i>

01:21:48.301 --> 01:21:49.503
<i>We stompin' on your mom</i>

01:21:49.537 --> 01:21:51.105
<i>Shoot, you can't keep up</i>

01:21:51.137 --> 01:21:53.106
<i>Say it again we

01:22:05.752 --> 01:22:07.521
<i>Think I want to spend the
cash on a trip to the moon</i>

01:22:07.555 --> 01:22:11.960
<i>I might be the first,
but we really don't know</i>

01:22:11.993 --> 01:22:15.063
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

01:22:15.095 --> 01:22:16.463
<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

01:22:16.497 --> 01:22:18.066
<i>Chica-chica-bang,

<i>Hey, hey, hey</i>

01:22:42.288 --> 01:22:45.726
Yo, please give
it up for infamous!

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.462
<i>We're infamous.</i>

01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:29.070
<i>Infamous.</i>

01:23:31.738 --> 01:23:34.141
Well, that was a
tough round, for real.

01:23:34.175 --> 01:23:35.409
Let's see what we got.

01:23:35.443 --> 01:23:38.079
We got a 2-freaky.

01:23:38.112 --> 01:23:40.480
We got an infamous.

01:23:40.514 --> 01:23:44.051
And the winner of this
round... 2-freaky!

01:23:44.085 --> 01:23:46.319
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi!

01:23:59.733 --> 01:24:00.734
What up, fairy?

01:24:00.768 --> 01:24:02.569
You know we're gonna kick
your ass tonight, right?

01:24:02.603 --> 01:24:06.239
Bitch, please. Don't touch.

01:24:08.175 --> 01:24:09.310
What the hell, brant?

01:24:09.342 --> 01:24:11.711
You're so tough.

01:24:14.747 --> 01:24:16.616
You think I've never
had to deal with idiots

01:24:16.649 --> 01:24:18.318
like you before?

01:24:18.351 --> 01:24:20.387
You think you're the man?

01:24:20.421 --> 01:24:22.390
Prove it on the floor.

01:24:25.626 --> 01:24:27.295
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

01:24:27.328 --> 01:24:29.263
let's hear it for
our two finalists...

01:24:29.296 --> 01:24:31.599
Last year's winners...
K-crew...

01:24:36.170 --> 01:24:39.106
And of course, the
news, the challengers.

01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:43.177
Make some noise for 2-freaky!

01:24:45.578 --> 01:24:48.282
All right, people,
if y'all are ready

01:24:48.314 --> 01:24:52.519
to get this battle started,
let me hear you say, "ho

01:24:52.552 --> 01:24:55.090
-ho...
-You all done?*

01:25:01.162 --> 01:25:04.398
you sent him to beat
up tino, didn't you?

01:25:04.430 --> 01:25:05.799
What is wrong with you?

01:25:05.832 --> 01:25:08.435
Shut your mouth.

01:25:11.305 --> 01:25:12.606
I'm making sure my crew wins.

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:14.408
Let the battle begin!

01:25:15.576 --> 01:25:18.813
It's not worth it. I'm out.

01:25:24.585 --> 01:25:27.221
We don't need her.

01:25:27.253 --> 01:25:28.590
No mistakes.

01:25:30.757 --> 01:25:33.327
She came to see you yesterday.

01:25:33.359 --> 01:25:35.563
She wanted to say she was sorry.

01:25:35.595 --> 01:25:36.897
It doesn't change what she did.

01:25:36.930 --> 01:25:40.634
Like you've never
made mistakes before?

01:25:40.667 --> 01:25:44.505
At least she was trying
to make things right.

01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:55.009
Snap.

01:26:55.042 --> 01:26:57.712
That was one of the
illest performances

01:26:57.744 --> 01:27:00.381
in the history of
this whole competition.

01:27:00.413 --> 01:27:05.619
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it for K-crew!

01:27:05.653 --> 01:27:09.390
I just wanted to tell
you how sorry I am.

01:27:09.422 --> 01:27:12.993
And good luck out there.

01:27:24.704 --> 01:27:27.641
Right about now,
taking to the stage...

01:27:27.675 --> 01:27:29.310
It's your time to shine.

01:27:29.342 --> 01:27:30.610
It's your turn to burn.

01:27:30.645 --> 01:27:36.317
Please, ladies and gentlemen,
please give it up for 2-freaky!

01:28:06.380 --> 01:28:07.815
How freaky?!

01:28:07.847 --> 01:28:08.748
2-freaky!

01:30:33.126 --> 01:30:36.163
What a finish, but, judges,
what we all want to know

01:30:36.195 --> 01:30:42.635
right now is what
are the final scores.

01:30:42.668 --> 01:30:44.104
<i>Won't leave you behind</i>

01:30:44.136 --> 01:30:46.139
<i>I'll carry you through</i>

01:30:46.172 --> 01:30:47.807
<i>I'll stand by your side</i>

01:30:47.841 --> 01:30:49.176
<i>nothing we cannot do</i>

01:30:49.208 --> 01:30:51.644
Representing us at the
world championships...

01:30:51.677 --> 01:30:56.015
And that's new champions...
2-freaky!

01:30:56.048 --> 01:30:58.652
Give it up! Give it up!

01:30:58.685 --> 01:31:02.923
Yeah!

01:31:02.956 --> 01:31:06.627
Let me hear you say,
"2-freaky, 2-freaky!"

01:31:06.659 --> 01:31:08.496
<i>I am with you</i>

01:31:08.529 --> 01:31:10.631
<i>I'll be with you</i>

01:31:10.663 --> 01:31:11.731
<i>Don't be afraid</i>

01:31:11.765 --> 01:31:14.635
<i>We can start again</i>

01:31:16.235 --> 01:31:18.671
<i>You can stand</i>

01:31:18.704 --> 01:31:20.541
<i>You will rise</i>

01:31:20.573 --> 01:31:22.509
<i>You can start again</i>

01:31:22.542 --> 01:31:24.545
<i>You can start again</i>

01:31:24.578 --> 01:31:26.647
<i>You can start again</i>

01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:30.918
2-Freaky!

01:31:40.627 --> 01:31:42.596
<i>I'll hold you close</i>

01:31:42.628 --> 01:31:44.532
<i>You can stand</i>

01:31:44.564 --> 01:31:46.132
<i>You will rise</i>

01:31:46.166 --> 01:31:48.702
<i>You can start again</i>

01:31:48.734 --> 01:31:50.637
<i>I will be your anchor</i>

01:31:50.671 --> 01:31:52.106
<i>I will not be moved</i>

01:31:52.139 --> 01:31:54.608
<i>Your burdens are lifted</i>

01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:56.009
<i>Out of you</i>

01:31:56.042 --> 01:31:59.979
<i>Now, you opened my eyes
to reclaim this life</i>

01:32:00.012 --> 01:32:04.318
<i>I was drowning at sea
until you rescued me</i>

01:32:04.350 --> 01:32:08.655
<i>So come on, babe,
to the battlefield</i>

01:32:08.689 --> 01:32:10.624
<i>I will be your armor</i>

01:32:10.657 --> 01:32:12.626
<i>The sword and shield</i>

01:32:12.658 --> 01:32:13.960
<i>We will rise again</i>

01:32:13.993 --> 01:32:16.095
<i>With our broken wings</i>

01:32:16.128 --> 01:32:20.667
<i>We will learn to fly
where our souls are free</i>

01:32:20.701 --> 01:32:24.137
<i>With every door that closes in</i>

01:32:24.171 --> 01:32:28.342
<i>Don't be afraid to start again</i>

01:32:28.375 --> 01:32:30.743
<i>I am with you</i>

01:32:30.777 --> 01:32:32.746

<i>We can start again</i>

01:32:36.182 --> 01:32:39.587
<i>I'll hold you
close, you can stand</i>

01:32:39.619 --> 01:32:40.921
<i>We can stand</i>

01:32:40.953 --> 01:32:43.056
<i>You will rise,

<i>And you will start again</i>

01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:18.659
<i>Yeah</i>

01:33:18.692 --> 01:33:20.627
<i>I'll hold you close</i>

01:33:20.661 --> 01:33:22.730

<i>Start again</i>

01:33:40.713 --> 01:33:42.350
<i>Start again</i>

01:33:56.063 --> 01:33:58.032
<i>New on the scene, the ocean mean</i>

01:33:58.064 --> 01:33:59.799
<i>Ain't no crown but she the queen</i>

01:33:59.832 --> 01:34:01.402
<i>Dreads been locked since 17</i>

01:34:01.435 --> 01:34:03.170
<i>Tryin' to hit the
jackpot, slot machine</i>

01:34:03.203 --> 01:34:04.905

01:34:09.975 --> 01:34:11.344
<i>Number-one girl

01:34:11.377 --> 01:34:12.813
<i>Been lifting, gonna
bring the flame</i>

01:34:12.845 --> 01:34:14.380
<i>Boy, what's your claim to fame?</i>

01:34:14.413 --> 01:34:15.815
<i>I got to play in the
game, never be the same</i>

01:34:15.849 --> 01:34:17.251
<i>I got to tell you, boy</i>

01:34:17.283 --> 01:34:18.818
<i>What, other girls

<i>Schooled 'em all, they
ain't enrolled like me</i>

<i>Fake girls, nah,

01:34:23.789 --> 01:34:25.292
<i>Unh, go on, jump ahead</i>

01:34:25.324 --> 01:34:27.126
<i>See 1,000 hands,
wanna pump and hit</i>

01:34:27.159 --> 01:34:28.828
<i>You girls all fine,
Donald trump your heads</i>

01:34:28.862 --> 01:34:30.698
<i>Set it off, set it off,
don't bump your head</i>

01:34:30.730 --> 01:34:32.166
<i>Bounce, make you break your neck</i>

01:34:32.198 --> 01:34:33.866
<i>So all you homies
better learn respect</i>

01:34:33.899 --> 01:34:35.835
<i>Check-mate, homey,
like my fist connects</i>

01:34:35.868 --> 01:34:37.304
<i>Car crash slow, get
ahead, get wrecked</i>

01:34:37.337 --> 01:34:41.307
<i>Get wrecked</i>

01:34:51.217 --> 01:34:52.752
<i>Everybody wanna
cruise with a crew</i>

01:34:52.786 --> 01:34:54.954
<i>Can't do what I do, make
'em all go "boo-hoo"</i>

01:34:54.988 --> 01:34:56.757
<i>She come through
as socks on a tutu</i>

01:34:56.789 --> 01:34:58.292
<i>Wanna spill your brains
out, like I shoot you</i>

01:34:58.324 --> 01:34:59.992
<i>His head is like a
voodoo, they all cuckoo</i>

01:35:00.025 --> 01:35:01.761
<i>Middle finger up
means "screw you"</i>

01:35:01.795 --> 01:35:03.963
<i>Let the bee hit your kung-fu,
I'm gonna dunk on a player</i>

01:35:03.997 --> 01:35:05.298
<i>Haven't figured
that I shoot hoops</i>

01:35:05.332 --> 01:35:06.800
<i>Just be banging like
a drummer, though</i>

01:35:06.832 --> 01:35:08.735
<i>Got heat in the kitchen
in the summer, though</i>

01:35:08.769 --> 01:35:10.738
<i>It's that red-hot-spot flow,
tight like a fresh knot,</i>

01:35:10.770 --> 01:35:12.105
<i>Blocked the shot, guess
you got to ball so hard</i>

01:35:12.139 --> 01:35:13.774
<i>Got me thinking that
you're gonna blow</i>

01:35:13.806 --> 01:35:15.242
<i>Flow so tight, so
tight like a dreaded fro</i>

01:35:15.274 --> 01:35:16.909
<i>Chicks so sick, so
sick, no medic, bro</i>

01:35:16.943 --> 01:35:19.213
<i>Done sweaty for a minute,
giddy as you're ready, go</i>

01:35:19.246 --> 01:35:21.215
<i>Gotta grip, fall, slip,
fall, pick up your bottom</i>

01:35:21.247 --> 01:35:22.849
<i>Lift before you trip-fall,</i>

<i>Lift before you trip-fall</i>

01:35:26.453 --> 01:35:28.021
<i>I'm so on</i>

01:35:28.054 --> 01:35:29.757
<i>I'm so wrong</i>

01:35:29.789 --> 01:35:31.859
<i>I'm so lit</i>

01:35:31.891 --> 01:35:33.327
