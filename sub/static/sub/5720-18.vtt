00:29.668 --> 00:32.006
Excuse me, I did what?

00:32.008 --> 00:33.667
You broke the washing machine.

00:33.668 --> 00:36.837
You put too many bath sheets in it.

00:36.838 --> 00:39.167
What's a bath sheet?

00:39.168 --> 00:40.837
Looks like a regular towel,
only way bigger,

so if you put more than
one in the machine,

Starting in 1947, the

Of the metaphoric clock?

But 79% of that .86% think

07:09.548 --> 07:11.547
it's a reliable indicator

08:26.458 --> 08:28.797
India, of course, is insisting
they'll handle the rescue

08:28.798 --> 08:31.877
and warned the Pakistanis not to
violate their sovereignty again.

08:31.878 --> 08:34.217
Why the hell are the
Pakistanis being so brazen?

08:34.217 --> 08:35.797
We have the leaders of both countries

08:35.798 --> 08:37.256
right here in the building.

08:37.258 --> 08:40.256
Can't we just get them in
a room and work this out

08:40.258 --> 08:42.008
before something goes horribly wrong?

08:43.298 --> 08:44.957
Or "wronger."

08:44.958 --> 08:47.297
As much as I would like
to think that would work,

08:47.298 --> 08:48.627
Prime Ministers Verma and Khoosat

08:48.628 --> 08:49.957
aren't exactly drinking buddies,

08:49.958 --> 08:51.715
and I don't want to put
fuel on this fire.

08:51.716 --> 08:52.898
It's a hell of a way

08:52.899 --> 08:54.171
to kick off peace talks.

08:54.172 --> 08:55.666
Congratulations on your confirmation

08:55.668 --> 08:57.007
as national security advisor.

08:57.008 --> 08:58.757
How's your first day going?

08:58.758 --> 09:02.664
Mr. President, we just got
our first satellite pictures

09:02.665 --> 09:04.168
of the crash site.

09:05.338 --> 09:07.337
(sighs)

09:07.338 --> 09:08.668
- JACKSON: Did it explode?
- WARE: No.

09:08.671 --> 09:10.257
HILL: Pilots must have dumped fuel.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.338
It's a good thing, because of this.

09:13.668 --> 09:15.007
DALTON: Some kind of bomb?

09:15.008 --> 09:17.667
The blunt nose cone and
60-inch body indicate

09:17.668 --> 09:20.048
a heavy spherical core and
thick protective shielding.

09:22.298 --> 09:23.627
You got to be kidding me.

09:23.628 --> 09:24.957
I wish.

09:24.958 --> 09:26.627
That's not just any bomb, sir.

09:26.628 --> 09:28.628
It's a nuclear warhead.

09:30.758 --> 09:38.449
Subtitle sync and corrections by
<b>awaqeded</b> for <b>www.addic7ed.com.</b>

09:43.959 --> 09:46.431
So when are we going to talk
about the elephant in the room?

09:46.432 --> 09:48.188
Which elephant would that be, sir?

09:48.189 --> 09:50.187
Beginning to feel like a herd.

09:50.188 --> 09:51.517
The fact that we didn't
know the Pakistanis

09:51.518 --> 09:52.857
were moving a nuclear bomb.

09:52.858 --> 09:54.517
They hate that we spy
on their nuclear program.

09:54.518 --> 09:56.187
That's why they're always
moving the bombs around.

09:56.188 --> 09:57.517
And we're supposed to be tracking them.

09:57.518 --> 09:58.857
It's an intelligence failure.

09:58.858 --> 10:00.857
Yes, but, to be fair,

10:00.858 --> 10:02.397
I think it's an impossible mission.

10:02.398 --> 10:03.767
The mission is to grab up the nukes

10:03.768 --> 10:05.437
in the event that the government falls.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.107
That's hard to achieve when
we don't know where they are.

10:07.108 --> 10:08.767
Given the fragility of the regime

10:08.768 --> 10:11.019
and the fact the radicals would
almost certainly take over,

10:11.020 --> 10:12.437
we can't afford intelligence failures,

10:12.438 --> 10:14.767
unless we're okay with
nuclear weapons ending up

10:14.768 --> 10:17.437
on the open market and falling
into the hands of terrorists.

10:17.438 --> 10:18.767
Listen, (sighs) all right,

10:18.768 --> 10:21.437
the Pakistanis and the
Indians are minutes away

10:21.438 --> 10:23.437
from a shootout over a nuclear bomb.

10:23.438 --> 10:27.108
I think we need to prioritize
our elephants, sir.

10:28.898 --> 10:30.568
(sighs)

10:34.728 --> 10:37.397
Prime Minister Khoosat, welcome.

10:37.398 --> 10:38.607
Madam Secretary.

10:38.608 --> 10:40.857
Am I to assume that President Dalton

10:40.858 --> 10:43.227
chose to speak with my
Indian counterpart over me?

10:43.228 --> 10:45.267
These aren't the circumstances

10:45.268 --> 10:47.267
that any of us expected
to be meeting under,

10:47.268 --> 10:48.857
so we can debate the protocol later,

10:48.858 --> 10:50.647
but right now

10:50.648 --> 10:53.437
I need you... (sighs)

10:53.438 --> 10:56.307
to call off your military
incursion in India.

10:56.308 --> 10:57.937
Oh, not an incursion...

10:57.938 --> 11:00.357
a simple rescue mission
of our plane's crew.

11:00.358 --> 11:04.267
A column of tanks and heavy artillery

11:04.268 --> 11:06.608
is hardly a simple rescue mission.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.607
You do know that we have satellites.

11:10.608 --> 11:12.937
We have a front row seat,

11:12.938 --> 11:15.397
featuring a perfect view

11:15.398 --> 11:16.938
of your nuclear bomb.

11:18.938 --> 11:21.267
I don't know what you're talking about.

11:21.268 --> 11:23.858
You need to get your
military to stand down.

11:28.308 --> 11:29.647
(sighs)

11:29.648 --> 11:31.147
Does Prime Minister Verma know?

11:31.148 --> 11:33.107
You must be kidding.

11:33.108 --> 11:35.437
Prime Minister Verma,

11:35.438 --> 11:37.897
there are three things
I never kid about:

11:37.898 --> 11:40.647
God, taxes, and nuclear bombs.

11:40.648 --> 11:43.187
Now, you need to call your generals

11:43.188 --> 11:45.898
and tell them to hold their fire.

11:49.568 --> 11:51.307
HENRY: Laila.

11:51.308 --> 11:52.307
Hi.

11:52.308 --> 11:53.477
Can we talk to you for a minute?

11:53.478 --> 11:55.107
This is my colleague, Jane Fellows.

11:55.108 --> 11:56.767
We won't take up much of your time.

11:56.768 --> 11:58.937
I-I only have a half an hour for lunch.

11:58.938 --> 12:01.267
And I-I don't have anything else to say.

12:01.268 --> 12:02.607
I did what you asked.

12:02.608 --> 12:03.807
Yes, you did

12:03.808 --> 12:05.647
and, uh, we greatly appreciate it.

12:05.648 --> 12:08.357
But now that you've established
contact with Hijriyyah,

12:08.358 --> 12:10.397
we need you to send one
more message to her.

12:10.398 --> 12:11.647
We were hoping you could send her

12:11.648 --> 12:12.767
something a little more personal,

12:12.768 --> 12:14.687
to remind her of your
time together back home.

12:14.688 --> 12:16.897
Maybe a video of some kind,

12:16.898 --> 12:19.687
or a PDF of an old assignment, or...

12:19.688 --> 12:21.187
Yeah, although...

12:21.188 --> 12:24.477
don't you people have
anything better to do?

12:24.478 --> 12:26.687
Why are you so interested in Hijriyyah?

12:26.688 --> 12:29.107
What do you want with this girl?

12:29.108 --> 12:30.807
I insist that you tell me.

12:30.808 --> 12:33.017
I understand you're taking

12:33.018 --> 12:35.358
your oath of citizenship tomorrow.

12:36.938 --> 12:38.397
Congratulations.

12:38.398 --> 12:39.208
So this is a threat.

12:39.209 --> 12:40.017
HENRY: No.

12:40.018 --> 12:41.187
Not at all.

12:41.188 --> 12:42.977
Could you just see if
you have anything else

12:42.978 --> 12:44.268
that-that might speak to her?

12:46.398 --> 12:48.607
I suppose I could take a look.

12:48.608 --> 12:51.437
But I can't promise
that I will find anything.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.607
Thank you.

12:52.608 --> 12:53.898
Good luck tomorrow.

13:00.108 --> 13:03.727
So we barely avoided an all-out
war with Russia in the fall,

13:03.728 --> 13:06.147
Hizb Al-Shahid is still out
there plotting more attacks,

13:06.148 --> 13:09.067
and now India is gloating
that a-a Pakistani nuke

13:09.068 --> 13:10.397
crash-landed within their border,

13:10.398 --> 13:12.017
and we're supposed to convince

13:12.018 --> 13:13.807
a bunch of hippie-dippie physicists

13:13.808 --> 13:15.397
that the world <i>isn't</i> getting
any more dangerous?

13:15.398 --> 13:17.147
Apparently, the Doomsday Clock people

13:17.148 --> 13:19.067
also take global warming into account,

13:19.068 --> 13:21.687
but yes, that's pretty
much our marching orders.

13:21.688 --> 13:23.567
Marching into a firing squad.

13:23.568 --> 13:25.898
And now it's time to execute.

13:26.898 --> 13:28.728
So to speak.

13:30.108 --> 13:32.147
Matt, would you please work

13:32.148 --> 13:33.647
with the people on the first floor

13:33.648 --> 13:35.767
on bullet pointing all the positive

13:35.768 --> 13:37.477
diplomatic outcomes from the last year?

13:37.478 --> 13:39.607
Those guys haven't had
anything positive to say

13:39.608 --> 13:41.107
since the Wall came down.

13:41.108 --> 13:43.148
And even then, they were
griping about the clean up.

13:44.018 --> 13:44.897
On it.

13:44.898 --> 13:46.267
Absolutely.

13:46.268 --> 13:48.268
Our time is theirs to squander.

13:49.688 --> 13:51.607
We serve at the pleasure.

13:51.608 --> 13:53.068
Even when it's painful.

13:55.018 --> 13:56.397
Daisy...

13:56.398 --> 13:59.107
this whole Doomsday Clock issue

13:59.108 --> 14:00.687
seems to have touched a nerve.

14:00.688 --> 14:01.977
Really? No.

14:01.978 --> 14:03.978
I'm just trying to get
my head around it.

14:05.478 --> 14:06.767
Okay, it's just...

14:06.768 --> 14:09.267
(sighs) clocks.

14:09.268 --> 14:10.937
One big, terrifying clock

14:10.938 --> 14:12.767
can't help reminding me of another.

14:12.768 --> 14:14.357
Of a more biological nature.

14:14.358 --> 14:15.977
Exactly.

14:15.978 --> 14:16.977
And not just babies.

14:16.978 --> 14:17.977
All of it.

14:17.978 --> 14:19.307
I see.

14:19.308 --> 14:21.067
Well, I don't mean to pry.

14:21.068 --> 14:22.477
No, you can pry.

14:22.478 --> 14:24.006
Clearly, I need to talk about it.

14:24.007 --> 14:25.648
It's affecting my work.

14:27.478 --> 14:29.187
Okay, here it is.

14:29.188 --> 14:32.017
I'm already two years
behind on my life plan.

14:32.018 --> 14:34.147
If everything had happened
the way it was supposed to,

14:34.148 --> 14:36.607
I'd be married and pregnant by now.

14:36.608 --> 14:38.267
As it is, I'm still dating,

14:38.268 --> 14:39.937
and the guy I'm dating... what is that?

14:39.938 --> 14:42.307
I mean, could it really
be a forever thing?

14:42.308 --> 14:44.307
He can barely spare 55 minutes...

14:44.308 --> 14:45.647
how's he gonna have a baby?

14:45.648 --> 14:48.147
That used to be my mind at 3:00 a.m.

14:48.148 --> 14:49.307
Now it's all the time.

14:49.308 --> 14:50.727
And that's really why

14:50.728 --> 14:52.067
you can't commit to him?

14:52.068 --> 14:53.357
Because he's too busy?

14:53.358 --> 14:54.517
No, it's not just that.

14:54.518 --> 14:56.227
I mean, sure, he's a genius

14:56.228 --> 14:57.897
and successful

14:57.898 --> 15:00.067
and funny

15:00.068 --> 15:02.187
and adept, if you know what I mean.

15:02.188 --> 15:03.517
Yes. Thank you.

15:03.518 --> 15:04.647
Up to speed.

15:04.648 --> 15:06.857
And I know that sounds
like the whole package,

15:06.858 --> 15:08.727
but there's this one thing

15:08.728 --> 15:10.147
that really matters to me.

15:10.148 --> 15:11.897
He lacks spontaneity.

15:11.898 --> 15:12.898
Just to go out to lunch,

15:12.899 --> 15:14.645
the guy has to create an App.

15:14.728 --> 15:16.147
I don't want both of us to be

15:16.148 --> 15:18.647
driven and result-oriented.

15:18.648 --> 15:20.107
What kind of life would that kid have?

15:20.108 --> 15:23.607
Two overachieving,
slightly obsessed parents?

15:23.608 --> 15:26.147
He'd be in therapy by preschool.

15:26.148 --> 15:29.017
See, I need someone to bring
out the spontaneity in me.

15:29.018 --> 15:32.357
It seems to me like you
have no idea what you want.

15:32.358 --> 15:34.937
I know exactly what I want.

15:34.938 --> 15:37.067
Just because it's rigid and unrealistic

15:37.068 --> 15:38.567
doesn't mean it's unattainable.

15:38.568 --> 15:40.807
Words to live by.

15:40.808 --> 15:42.687
(door opens)

15:42.688 --> 15:45.187
Verma agreed that India will stand down

15:45.188 --> 15:47.397
and allow a small Pakistani
team to cross its border

15:47.398 --> 15:48.647
and tend to their plane's crew.

15:48.648 --> 15:49.687
Oh, good.

15:49.688 --> 15:51.147
I think Khoosat will go for that.

15:51.148 --> 15:54.187
But he was pretty insistent
about wanting his bomb back.

15:54.188 --> 15:56.567
Yeah, he might, uh,
have to wait on that.

15:56.568 --> 16:00.107
NGA analyzed the satellite
pictures of the warhead.

16:00.108 --> 16:02.687
Apparently, its triggering
mechanism is badly damaged

16:02.688 --> 16:04.187
and the bomb's "penalty" system

16:04.188 --> 16:07.147
is most likely extremely sensitive.

16:07.148 --> 16:08.308
I'm no physicist,

16:08.309 --> 16:10.977
but I don't think you
want your nuclear bomb

16:10.978 --> 16:13.977
overly sensitive or in penalty.

16:13.978 --> 16:17.517
The penalty system
will set off the bomb

16:17.518 --> 16:19.607
if it's tampered with improperly.

16:19.608 --> 16:22.437
And I guess crashing in the
desert wasn't very proper.

16:22.438 --> 16:24.107
So it needs to be defused.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.727
Quickly, expertly,

16:25.728 --> 16:27.437
carefully.

16:27.438 --> 16:30.267
We might have to get Khoosat
and Verma in a room after all.

16:30.268 --> 16:32.227
I-I'm gonna catch up with you.

16:32.228 --> 16:33.357
Just one second.

16:33.358 --> 16:34.607
Do you mind?

16:34.608 --> 16:36.608
- Can I just steal you for one minute?
- Yeah, sure.

16:36.611 --> 16:39.607
You've heard about everything
that's going on here.

16:39.608 --> 16:40.548
Yeah.

16:40.549 --> 16:42.837
So I know it seems pretty
petty for me to bring this up,

16:42.838 --> 16:44.701
but you said you'd handle it,

16:44.702 --> 16:46.437
and it's just causing
me a lot of anxiety,

16:46.438 --> 16:47.608
so I thought I would check.

16:48.768 --> 16:50.567
Oh, the washing machine.

16:50.568 --> 16:51.727
It's fine.

16:51.728 --> 16:52.897
I ordered the part online.

16:52.898 --> 16:54.607
It'll come tomorrow and I'll fix it.

16:54.608 --> 16:55.857
It'll be fine.

16:55.858 --> 16:57.107
You'll fix it?

16:57.108 --> 16:58.977
I thought you were gonna
call a repairman.

16:58.978 --> 17:00.977
No, I said I would take care of it.

17:00.978 --> 17:01.938
Henry...

17:01.939 --> 17:02.897
It's fine.

17:02.898 --> 17:05.147
I don't want to bring
up the garage door.

17:09.647 --> 17:11.357
That was a total fluke.

17:11.358 --> 17:14.567
A fluke that crushed two bicycles

17:14.568 --> 17:16.734
and nearly took out the UPS guy.

17:16.736 --> 17:17.719
Are you aware that I'm capable

17:17.720 --> 17:19.270
of overriding a navigation system

17:19.271 --> 17:20.863
on a fighter jet at 40,000 feet?

17:20.864 --> 17:22.381
I feel really out of control

17:22.382 --> 17:23.798
when a major appliance is broken.

17:24.397 --> 17:26.357
Like I can't take care of my family.

17:26.358 --> 17:28.068
- I know.
- And Alison is two days out

17:28.070 --> 17:29.397
of her school uniform

17:29.398 --> 17:30.589
and then she'll get demerits.

17:30.590 --> 17:31.926
Jason doesn't even have a "B" wardrobe.

17:31.927 --> 17:34.727
(whispering): And I am already
in the sad underwear.

17:34.728 --> 17:36.187
It's gonna be fine.

17:36.188 --> 17:37.977
I promise.

17:37.978 --> 17:39.655
(sighs)

17:39.656 --> 17:41.429
VERMA: <i>I should have known
you could never negotiate</i>

17:41.430 --> 17:42.445
in good faith.

17:42.446 --> 17:44.929
Oh, so you think we crashed
our plane on purpose?

17:44.930 --> 17:47.336
- Okay...
- I think your military only agreed to negotiations

17:47.337 --> 17:49.017
if you moved your nuclear
bombs closer to our border.

17:49.018 --> 17:50.068
- You don't care about peace.
- Prime Minister...

17:50.071 --> 17:52.567
We can move our weapons
wherever we want.

17:52.568 --> 17:54.227
Oh, then we can refuse

17:54.228 --> 17:56.017
to talk to your puppet government

17:56.018 --> 17:57.687
that is controlled by
warmonger generals

17:57.688 --> 17:59.357
that aren't even serious
about negotiating.

17:59.358 --> 18:00.517
DALTON: None of this will matter

18:00.518 --> 18:02.227
if that bomb goes off.

18:02.228 --> 18:04.227
Which it very well may,

18:04.228 --> 18:07.092
unless we agree on a plan
to defuse it and fast.

18:07.093 --> 18:08.679
I am sending in a team of engineers.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.440
- No, you're not.
- KHOOSAT: It's our weapon.

18:10.481 --> 18:12.965
In my country, and if you
can't even transport it

18:12.966 --> 18:14.523
without crashing into our lands,

18:14.524 --> 18:16.187
how are you going to defuse it?

18:16.188 --> 18:18.001
India will send in a team of experts.

18:18.002 --> 18:20.545
To work on Pakistan's bomb?
No. This will not happen.

18:20.546 --> 18:21.699
How will you stop us?

18:21.700 --> 18:23.420
We thought you might
have this reaction,

18:23.421 --> 18:24.606
so we have another idea.

18:24.608 --> 18:26.143
The United States will send

18:26.144 --> 18:28.647
a Joint Tactical Operations team

18:28.648 --> 18:30.147
to defuse the bomb.

18:30.148 --> 18:31.871
In fact, they are already in the air

18:31.872 --> 18:34.044
- from our base in Qatar.
- It is our bomb.

18:34.045 --> 18:36.049
Only our engineers know the design.

18:36.050 --> 18:37.575
ELIZABETH: Yes, and your people

18:37.576 --> 18:39.857
will be there to advise.

18:39.858 --> 18:44.227
Without actually... touching the bomb.

18:44.228 --> 18:46.767
And since the site is inside India,

18:46.768 --> 18:49.977
an Indian team will be there
to oversee the operation.

18:49.978 --> 18:52.267
ELIZABETH: We know it's
not ideal for either of you.

18:52.268 --> 18:55.647
But it is a compromise
that you can both survive

18:55.648 --> 18:56.647
politically.

18:56.648 --> 18:57.925
Now, unfortunately, we don't have

18:57.926 --> 18:59.897
any more time to talk about this.

18:59.898 --> 19:01.608
So are we all in agreement?

19:03.000 --> 19:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

19:15.433 --> 19:17.602
Well, so much for our
do-gooding teacher.

19:17.603 --> 19:20.727
After your visit, she
immediately e-mails Hijriyyah

19:20.728 --> 19:22.900
to warn her about our
attempts to track her down?

19:23.897 --> 19:25.396
I assume that's what you're looking at

19:25.397 --> 19:26.896
with those graveyard expressions.

19:26.897 --> 19:28.346
We knew this was a possibility.

19:28.347 --> 19:31.636
Yes, so we managed
to intercept the e-mail.

19:31.637 --> 19:34.556
But I have had a change of
heart about our strategy.

19:34.557 --> 19:37.306
I am going with arrest and detain her,

19:37.307 --> 19:39.056
ransack her apartment,

19:39.057 --> 19:40.976
block her citizenship

19:40.977 --> 19:42.726
and leave her to the
mercy of Immigration.

19:42.727 --> 19:44.056
You got my vote.

19:44.057 --> 19:45.596
Oh, here's Henry

19:45.597 --> 19:47.396
to tell me why that's too extreme.

19:47.397 --> 19:48.726
Her e-mail showed no complicity

19:48.727 --> 19:50.096
with terrorists or radical jihad.

19:50.097 --> 19:52.976
If she had known that Hijriyyah
was married to the world's

19:52.977 --> 19:54.859
most wanted man, she might
have been willing to help.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.028
She lived for years under
a very oppressive regime.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.037
All she saw was a powerful
government agency

19:59.038 --> 20:00.712
suddenly targeting a former student.

20:00.713 --> 20:02.503
She was concerned
for the girl's safety.

20:02.504 --> 20:05.002
That is profoundly uninteresting to me.

20:05.004 --> 20:08.003
I'm turning this over to Jose now.

20:08.004 --> 20:09.463
Put together a small tactical team

20:09.464 --> 20:10.978
to go in there and turn
the place upside down

20:10.979 --> 20:12.503
for anything that might be of use.

20:12.504 --> 20:14.121
Yes, sir. My pleasure.

20:14.122 --> 20:15.503
You two, get fine with this.

20:15.504 --> 20:16.883
Now, if you'll excuse me,

20:16.884 --> 20:18.884
I have to see about a nuclear bomb.

20:20.714 --> 20:22.213
JOSE: You may have a handle on, uh,

20:22.214 --> 20:24.593
military ethics, Professor,

20:24.594 --> 20:27.763
but I come from the
school of whatever works.

20:27.764 --> 20:29.764
And this works.

20:36.424 --> 20:37.463
How's it going?

20:37.464 --> 20:39.053
No mushroom cloud.

20:39.054 --> 20:40.213
Not yet.

20:40.214 --> 20:42.518
WARE: Sir, our JTOC coordinator

20:42.519 --> 20:43.678
at the bomb site

20:43.679 --> 20:44.968
just sent his latest assessment.

20:44.969 --> 20:46.808
They still think they can
defuse the damn thing?

20:46.809 --> 20:48.428
Yes. But it's not the type of warhead

20:48.429 --> 20:49.758
they expected to find.

20:49.759 --> 20:51.178
What the hell is it?

20:51.179 --> 20:52.929
A hydrogen bomb.

20:56.139 --> 20:58.348
The hits keep coming.

20:58.349 --> 21:00.968
Well, no wonder the
Pakistanis were so reluctant

21:00.969 --> 21:02.848
to let us get under its hood.

21:02.849 --> 21:05.348
So not only did we not
know they were moving it,

21:05.349 --> 21:07.639
we didn't even know they'd
upgraded their technology.

21:12.349 --> 21:14.888
Of course the secretary
is aware of the situation.

21:14.889 --> 21:17.308
Of course she's involved and
of course it is being managed.

21:17.309 --> 21:20.468
It's a misplaced nuclear bomb, Evan.

21:20.469 --> 21:21.928
Do you really think anyone's

21:21.929 --> 21:24.138
waiting around to see how it plays out?

21:24.139 --> 21:26.678
You absolutely can print that.

21:26.679 --> 21:28.348
Hey, ready to go?

21:28.349 --> 21:30.218
I got a recommendation
from Russell Jackson.

21:30.219 --> 21:31.678
It is a six-minute walk.

21:31.679 --> 21:32.968
I printed up the menu,

21:32.969 --> 21:34.928
so we can decide what to
order on the walk over.

21:34.929 --> 21:36.348
And you are looking at me

21:36.349 --> 21:38.178
like you have no idea
what I'm talking about.

21:38.179 --> 21:40.178
The 55-minute window.

21:40.179 --> 21:41.428
I forgot.

21:41.429 --> 21:42.518
But can't.

21:42.519 --> 21:44.468
I have to convince

21:44.469 --> 21:45.848
the <i>Bulletin of Atomic Scientists</i>

21:45.849 --> 21:47.678
to not move the Doomsday
Clock up one minute.

21:47.679 --> 21:49.348
Oh, seriously?

21:49.349 --> 21:50.808
That is so cool.

21:50.809 --> 21:51.974
How is that...?

21:51.975 --> 21:53.138
The people

21:53.139 --> 21:54.558
on the <i>Bulletin's</i> Science
and Security Board

21:54.559 --> 21:57.018
are like rock stars in
their individual fields.

21:57.019 --> 21:59.428
Nobel Prize-winning
physicists and engineers.

21:59.429 --> 22:01.218
I'm a big fan of their work.

22:01.219 --> 22:02.928
And not everyone knows this about them,

22:02.929 --> 22:04.308
insane partiers.

22:04.309 --> 22:06.018
Just before they announce
their publication,

22:06.019 --> 22:08.638
they throw a big blowout
into all hours of the night.

22:08.639 --> 22:12.258
Well, as someone with insight
into these great minds,

22:12.259 --> 22:14.558
do you think I'm gonna
be able to get them

22:14.559 --> 22:16.058
to keep the clock where it is?

22:16.059 --> 22:17.559
- Yeah...
- If the bomb were to detonate...

22:17.562 --> 22:20.018
I don't like your chances.

22:20.019 --> 22:22.218
(reporter continues
speaking indistinctly)

22:22.219 --> 22:24.218
So, I'll-I'll bring something back?

22:24.219 --> 22:26.388
...a nuclear weapon this close
to the Indian border...

22:26.389 --> 22:28.678
a highly-militarized border...

22:28.679 --> 22:31.388
while in the middle of
sensitive peace talks.

22:31.389 --> 22:32.244
Hey.

22:32.245 --> 22:33.098
Hey.

22:33.099 --> 22:34.258
Where are you going?

22:34.259 --> 22:35.428
Uh, just out for some air.

22:35.429 --> 22:36.808
Sure, I'll buy that.

22:36.809 --> 22:38.098
Oh, hey, I've got good news.

22:38.099 --> 22:39.597
I got the order confirmation.

22:39.598 --> 22:41.678
The part for the washing
machine is coming in tonight.

22:41.679 --> 22:43.758
Great, repairman's coming tomorrow.

22:43.759 --> 22:45.758
No, you didn't.

22:45.759 --> 22:47.098
I called Earl.

22:47.099 --> 22:48.598
No, not Earl!

22:48.599 --> 22:50.138
He knows his stuff.

22:50.139 --> 22:52.758
He's judgy and pessimistic,
like if you break an appliance,

22:52.759 --> 22:54.308
your whole house is broken
and there's no hope.

22:54.309 --> 22:55.348
You just have to move.

22:55.349 --> 22:57.468
I know, and then he fixes it.

22:57.469 --> 22:58.518
(sighs)

22:58.519 --> 23:01.258
Look, I-I-I realize
that you could do it.

23:01.259 --> 23:05.518
But it's not your... specialty.

23:05.519 --> 23:08.258
And Earl? That's all he does.

23:08.259 --> 23:09.776
And when you have a problem,

23:09.777 --> 23:11.454
you get the right person for the job.

23:11.455 --> 23:13.033
Babe, it's a washing machine.

23:13.034 --> 23:14.283
It's not a nuclear bomb.

23:14.284 --> 23:15.743
I know that.

23:15.744 --> 23:17.623
I do have perspective.

23:17.624 --> 23:18.953
But he's coming anyway.

23:18.954 --> 23:20.413
First thing in the morning.

23:20.414 --> 23:21.573
(huffs)

23:21.574 --> 23:22.824
I love you.

23:22.825 --> 23:24.074
(chuckles)

23:27.744 --> 23:29.913
Bomb's defused!

23:29.914 --> 23:31.703
Oh, wow.

23:31.704 --> 23:32.863
Ah...

23:32.864 --> 23:34.533
Well, good thing

23:34.534 --> 23:36.783
we weren't on the JTOC team.

23:36.784 --> 23:38.533
Sorry, I guess, uh,

23:38.534 --> 23:40.823
averting a nuclear disaster

23:40.824 --> 23:42.283
got me a little revved up.

23:42.284 --> 23:45.573
Well, that's almost adorable.

23:45.574 --> 23:47.123
Yeah, now the hard work begins.

23:47.124 --> 23:50.493
Are they really going to fight
over custody of this bomb?

23:50.494 --> 23:52.580
They've already dug in.

23:52.581 --> 23:53.950
Damn nuclear arsenal's

23:53.951 --> 23:56.275
the Pakistani people's
greatest point of pride.

23:56.276 --> 23:57.974
Well, the Indians aren't gonna be seen

23:57.975 --> 23:59.894
handing their mortal enemy

23:59.895 --> 24:02.644
their weapon of mass destruction back.

24:02.645 --> 24:05.775
I should've stuck to teaching.

24:07.065 --> 24:10.026
Prime Minister Khoosat,
sorry to keep you waiting.

24:10.027 --> 24:12.906
I was actually surprised
to be left alone

24:12.907 --> 24:14.274
in the Oval Office.

24:14.275 --> 24:17.144
Well, you are the, uh,
first foreign dignitary

24:17.145 --> 24:19.184
ever to have the privilege.

24:19.185 --> 24:22.423
You're not going to convince
me to give up our bomb.

24:23.632 --> 24:24.851
Mr. Prime Minister,

24:24.852 --> 24:28.221
the reason we kept you
waiting is because it took

24:28.222 --> 24:31.011
quite a bit of arm-twisting
to get Prime Minister Verma

24:31.012 --> 24:33.391
to agree to give up
your nuclear warhead.

24:33.392 --> 24:34.681
This is good news.

24:34.682 --> 24:36.328
DALTON: Yes, Verma
agreed to turn it over

24:36.329 --> 24:37.947
to the United States.

24:37.948 --> 24:40.367
ELIZABETH: We understand this
is not exactly what you want,

24:40.368 --> 24:43.867
but it keeps India from learning
your proprietary designs,

24:43.868 --> 24:46.077
so you maintain whatever
strategic advantages

24:46.078 --> 24:47.787
you already have.

24:47.788 --> 24:50.287
We know your arsenal
has more than 100 bombs.

24:50.288 --> 24:54.037
In practical terms,
one fewer won't really matter.

24:54.038 --> 24:56.247
My generals will never accept this.

24:56.248 --> 24:59.747
Well, this is the only deal
India <i>will </i> accept.

24:59.748 --> 25:03.447
I suggest you convince your
generals to get on board

25:03.448 --> 25:06.907
before the Indians change
their minds and take your weapon

25:06.908 --> 25:09.248
to their labs to be dissected.

25:10.618 --> 25:12.407
No.

25:12.408 --> 25:13.787
Absolutely not.

25:13.788 --> 25:15.577
It would make me a traitor

25:15.578 --> 25:16.657
to my people.

25:16.658 --> 25:17.787
You would take a hit

25:17.788 --> 25:18.987
politically.

25:18.988 --> 25:21.867
The alternative is war with India.

25:21.868 --> 25:23.697
Do you think your people
would prefer that?

25:23.698 --> 25:25.158
Yes, I do.

25:25.868 --> 25:29.158
(door opens, closes)

25:42.680 --> 25:44.799
(sighs) I don't have anything for you.

25:44.800 --> 25:46.380
You need to let me in.

25:52.009 --> 25:53.588
LAILA: <i>I looked for an attachment.</i>

25:53.589 --> 25:55.798
I couldn't find anything of interest.

25:55.799 --> 25:58.589
We intercepted your e-mail.

26:03.839 --> 26:05.638
So, what comes now?

26:05.639 --> 26:08.378
You deny my citizenship
application and you send me

26:08.379 --> 26:09.928
back to Libya?

26:09.929 --> 26:11.968
I'm not in favor of that, but shortly

26:11.969 --> 26:14.009
you're gonna be meeting
some people who are.

26:15.429 --> 26:17.928
I can't protect you if
you won't cooperate.

26:17.929 --> 26:21.178
Please, why can't you
just leave me alone?

26:21.179 --> 26:22.428
Are you familiar with the oath

26:22.429 --> 26:23.638
you're planning to take tomorrow?

26:23.639 --> 26:24.678
I'm not vowing

26:24.679 --> 26:27.178
to take action against innocent people.

26:27.179 --> 26:29.638
For all I know you're going
to drone strike her village.

26:29.639 --> 26:31.878
You're going to raid her home,
kill her, call it

26:31.879 --> 26:33.638
collateral damage.

26:33.639 --> 26:36.009
I can't have the blood
of that girl on my hands.

26:37.639 --> 26:39.718
I will only send this e-mail
if you can assure me

26:39.719 --> 26:41.588
that she will be safe.

26:41.589 --> 26:44.049
I can't do that.

26:45.089 --> 26:47.719
Well, then I can't help you.

26:52.839 --> 26:54.549
(sighs)

26:57.219 --> 27:00.429
Hijriyyah's father married her
to a very dangerous man.

27:03.799 --> 27:06.469
The most wanted man
in the world right now.

27:09.969 --> 27:11.878
We have no idea what
her allegiances are.

27:11.879 --> 27:13.428
And you're right.

27:13.429 --> 27:15.798
Most of the people
I work with don't care.

27:15.799 --> 27:18.798
But judging by the e-mail
she sent back to you,

27:18.799 --> 27:20.798
I believe that she is an unwilling

27:20.799 --> 27:23.928
and unhappy participant
in a dangerous place.

27:23.929 --> 27:26.178
The message was a cry for help.

27:26.179 --> 27:29.878
You think that by doing
nothing you're helping her?

27:29.879 --> 27:31.758
You're not.

27:31.759 --> 27:35.378
If you stay silent, you'll be
punished for your betrayal.

27:35.379 --> 27:36.758
I didn't betray...

27:36.759 --> 27:40.338
Hijriyyah will stay in the
care of a violent fugitive.

27:40.339 --> 27:41.758
Someday we're gonna catch him.

27:41.759 --> 27:43.928
I can't tell you when day
that will be, but we will.

27:43.929 --> 27:46.339
And no one is gonna care about
her safety when that happens.

27:49.179 --> 27:51.379
If you help...

27:53.469 --> 27:55.928
...you'll be giving Hijriyyah
her very best chance

27:55.929 --> 27:57.509
at making it out alive.

28:00.049 --> 28:02.088
NADINE: <i>As I'm sure you're aware,</i>

28:02.089 --> 28:04.088
<i>we'd like to continue</i>

28:04.089 --> 28:06.218
the conversation we started earlier

28:06.219 --> 28:08.088
about the Doomsday Clock.

28:08.089 --> 28:09.678
We thought our ideas could be

28:09.679 --> 28:11.838
expressed more accurately in person.

28:11.839 --> 28:14.678
We took the liberty of
making a list of things

28:14.679 --> 28:17.588
this administration has done
to increase nuclear safety,

28:17.589 --> 28:19.218
including... and especially...

28:19.219 --> 28:21.638
the historic peace agreement with Iran,

28:21.639 --> 28:24.138
our Pacific Rim trade agreement,

28:24.139 --> 28:25.338
our peace treaty with Russia.

28:25.339 --> 28:26.548
Well, that was a squeaker.

28:26.549 --> 28:28.968
The president remains committed

28:28.969 --> 28:30.838
to the issue of climate change.

28:30.839 --> 28:32.428
His first year in office,

28:32.429 --> 28:34.878
he passed new standards
for carbon emissions.

28:34.879 --> 28:38.338
He created new incentives
for alternative energy sources.

28:38.339 --> 28:39.968
MAN: Look, the clock isn't a bank.

28:39.969 --> 28:41.468
It isn't a point system.

28:41.469 --> 28:42.798
It's real time,

28:42.799 --> 28:45.008
based on a real threat assessment.

28:45.009 --> 28:46.258
It's not subjective.

28:46.259 --> 28:47.548
It's math.

28:47.549 --> 28:49.035
WOMAN: It is a bit theoretical,

28:49.036 --> 28:50.548
but it's still math.

28:50.549 --> 28:52.878
Well, all right,
while we're talking math,

28:52.879 --> 28:55.138
we've provided you with
this administration's budget

28:55.139 --> 28:57.218
for Federal-supportive science

28:57.219 --> 28:59.218
and nuclear security.

28:59.219 --> 29:01.178
Support, which by the way,

29:01.179 --> 29:03.338
would shrink considerably

29:03.339 --> 29:05.678
if the opposing party
were to take office.

29:05.679 --> 29:07.758
Well, now you're just blatantly
campaigning, Ms. Tolliver.

29:07.759 --> 29:09.928
This isn't politics.

29:09.929 --> 29:11.258
It's science.

29:11.259 --> 29:13.048
We're moving the clock up two minutes.

29:13.049 --> 29:14.548
This morning it was only one.

29:14.549 --> 29:16.508
This morning Pakistan and India

29:16.509 --> 29:18.258
weren't on the brink of a nuclear war.

29:18.259 --> 29:19.838
But the vote isn't final.

29:19.839 --> 29:20.968
Want to put some money on it?

29:20.969 --> 29:23.298
NADINE: All right, well,

29:23.299 --> 29:25.218
who can we speak with then?

29:25.219 --> 29:27.048
We tried to contact Stuart Bachman,

29:27.049 --> 29:28.878
the President of the <i>Bulletin,</i>

29:28.879 --> 29:30.218
but he didn't return our calls.

29:30.219 --> 29:31.378
Yeah, he hates phones.

29:31.379 --> 29:33.008
But you can try him
at the rager tonight.

29:33.009 --> 29:34.468
He's usually in a
pretty good mood there.

29:34.469 --> 29:36.218
Your big doomsday party?

29:36.219 --> 29:37.838
That's happening tonight?

29:37.839 --> 29:38.724
Yes.

29:38.725 --> 29:40.540
The sweet spot is somewhere between

29:40.541 --> 29:42.686
the second martini
and the shots of mescal.

29:42.887 --> 29:44.570
After that it's just
a lot of running man.

29:44.571 --> 29:45.856
Shirtless running man.

29:45.857 --> 29:47.019
And screaming about buckyball

29:47.020 --> 29:49.088
versus M-brane theory.

29:49.089 --> 29:51.088
Yeah, get there early.

29:51.089 --> 29:52.588
Hmm.

29:52.589 --> 29:54.089
(protestors clamoring)

29:55.679 --> 29:57.838
HILL: That's just Islamabad.

29:57.839 --> 29:59.378
We're getting reports
of increasing violence

29:59.379 --> 30:02.178
and protests in Karachi, Rawalpindi,

30:02.179 --> 30:04.298
and Lahore over India
keeping their bomb.

30:04.299 --> 30:06.088
Very Arab Spring.

30:06.089 --> 30:07.713
Short of getting their
bomb back, I'd say it's

30:07.714 --> 30:10.838
only a matter of days before
Pakistan's government collapses.

30:10.839 --> 30:12.270
Or a matter of hours.

30:12.271 --> 30:13.279
DALTON: What is the situation

30:13.280 --> 30:14.475
with the bomb, Ephraim?

30:14.476 --> 30:16.635
The JTOC team is literally
acting at this point,

30:16.636 --> 30:19.805
going through a series
of final safety checks

30:19.806 --> 30:21.385
that aren't really necessary.

30:21.386 --> 30:22.555
It's getting tense.

30:22.556 --> 30:24.632
Pakistan's amassing
troops along the border.

30:24.633 --> 30:26.635
India, of course is responding in kind.

30:26.636 --> 30:28.185
How quickly can we get
our people out there?

30:28.186 --> 30:29.278
As long as it takes them to run

30:29.279 --> 30:30.845
to their choppers... a couple HH-60G's.

30:30.846 --> 30:32.744
JACKSON: Assuming they don't
get caught in the crossfire.

30:32.745 --> 30:34.975
But basically we're looking
at Pakistan imploding

30:34.976 --> 30:37.015
or going to war with India.

30:37.016 --> 30:38.385
JACKSON: Either way,

30:38.386 --> 30:41.475
their nuclear arsenal
becomes incredibly insecure.

30:41.476 --> 30:43.385
Available to the highest bidder.

30:43.386 --> 30:44.765
HILL: Russian GRU has
already reached out

30:44.766 --> 30:47.015
to work in concert with us to secure

30:47.016 --> 30:48.685
Pakistan's nuclear weapons.

30:48.686 --> 30:52.095
But we doubt their intelligence
on them is any better than ours.

30:52.096 --> 30:54.845
So this is where we are.

30:54.846 --> 30:56.555
Maybe we're going at
this the wrong way.

30:56.556 --> 30:57.726
What do you mean?

31:00.266 --> 31:03.056
Maybe the time to negotiate has passed.

31:09.726 --> 31:13.030
Ms. Ayyad, United States
Immigration Service.

31:13.031 --> 31:13.846
Open the door.

31:16.426 --> 31:18.845
Open the door, Ms. Ayyad.

31:18.846 --> 31:20.846
AGENT: The door!

31:22.556 --> 31:23.806
What the hell?

31:25.636 --> 31:27.185
AGENT: Stand down.

31:27.186 --> 31:28.346
Here's our attachment.

31:34.556 --> 31:37.386
Whatever works, right?

31:43.886 --> 31:45.826
Thank you for waiting,
Prime Minister Verma.

31:45.827 --> 31:48.243
My country is preparing for war;
I need to get back.

31:48.244 --> 31:49.243
Have you seen the news?

31:49.244 --> 31:50.953
Islamabad is burning.

31:50.954 --> 31:52.493
I cannot control their people.

31:52.494 --> 31:54.163
That's true.

31:54.164 --> 31:56.823
The problem is Khoosat won't
go down without a fight.

31:56.824 --> 32:00.953
He will choose war over his
government being toppled.

32:00.954 --> 32:02.283
This is up to him,

32:02.284 --> 32:05.704
and there's nothing more
for <i>us </i> to talk about.

32:07.664 --> 32:09.664
DALTON: Prime Minister.

32:14.454 --> 32:18.123
We need to agree, right now,

32:18.124 --> 32:20.453
to allow Pakistan to
have its weapon back.

32:20.454 --> 32:22.453
It will be a black eye for India,

32:22.454 --> 32:24.913
but a hell of a lot better than a war

32:24.914 --> 32:26.413
with millions of casualties.

32:26.414 --> 32:30.073
I already agreed to allow the
United States to hold the bomb.

32:30.074 --> 32:31.863
Which was very diplomatic of you.

32:31.864 --> 32:33.203
Unfortunately,

32:33.204 --> 32:36.413
the rioting in Pakistan
has changed that equation.

32:36.414 --> 32:38.413
Indeed, it has,
but we've had many conflicts

32:38.414 --> 32:40.073
with Pakistan since the partition.

32:40.074 --> 32:41.573
We're prepared for another.

32:41.574 --> 32:44.573
And we're prepared...

32:44.574 --> 32:48.537
to deliver you a package of RQ-4

32:48.538 --> 32:49.243
spy drones

32:49.244 --> 32:52.243
and AT4 anti-tank missiles

32:52.244 --> 32:55.544
and membership into our
Pacific Trade Partnership,

32:55.545 --> 32:58.033
which would bring tens,
if not hundreds,

32:58.034 --> 33:00.413
of billions to your economy.

33:00.414 --> 33:02.823
How about this...

33:02.824 --> 33:04.283
instead of war?

33:04.284 --> 33:07.953
The window on diplomacy has closed.

33:07.954 --> 33:09.623
I must go.

33:09.624 --> 33:11.623
DALTON: Jaya.

33:11.624 --> 33:14.363
This isn't a negotiation.

33:14.364 --> 33:15.913
Excuse me?

33:15.914 --> 33:18.913
The United States team
that worked on the bomb

33:18.914 --> 33:21.413
is going to load it
inside one of our helicopters

33:21.414 --> 33:24.993
and return it to Pasha Base
inside the Pakistani border.

33:24.994 --> 33:28.703
India will be within its rights
to shoot down your helicopter

33:28.704 --> 33:30.363
before it reaches Pakistan.

33:30.364 --> 33:32.363
Yes.

33:32.364 --> 33:34.824
And that would be very foolish.

33:52.484 --> 33:54.044
ELIZABETH: <i>Prime Minister Khoosat.</i>

33:55.744 --> 33:58.403
Surprised you hadn't
returned to Islamabad yet.

33:58.404 --> 34:01.243
Oh, it's easier to manage things
from here than on a plane.

34:01.244 --> 34:05.243
It's a difficult time,
so I'll cut to the chase.

34:05.244 --> 34:07.903
The United States might be willing

34:07.904 --> 34:10.943
to deliver your nuclear
warhead back to Pasha Base.

34:10.944 --> 34:12.193
What about India?

34:12.194 --> 34:14.193
Well, we can handle India,

34:14.194 --> 34:18.243
though it would severely harm
our relationship with them.

34:18.244 --> 34:19.943
But it would be worth it to us

34:19.944 --> 34:22.194
if you give us something
that we want very much.

34:23.944 --> 34:25.283
I'm listening.

34:25.284 --> 34:27.943
Complete access to your
entire nuclear arsenal.

34:27.944 --> 34:31.283
You'll provide us with real-time
reports on their movements,

34:31.284 --> 34:34.612
we'll verify with our own
signals and human intelligence.

34:34.614 --> 34:37.322
We want to know where your bombs are

34:37.324 --> 34:40.324
at every second of every day.

34:41.984 --> 34:43.483
This is insane.

34:43.484 --> 34:45.483
Well, you know we've always
been tracking your arsenal

34:45.484 --> 34:50.283
with human Intel... for exactly
a situation like we faced today.

34:50.284 --> 34:52.435
My government cannot tolerate

34:52.436 --> 34:55.378
your nuclear bombs falling
into the hands of radicals,

34:55.379 --> 34:59.047
which is a distinct possibility
should your government fall.

34:59.054 --> 35:00.483
If you don't give us our bomb back,

35:00.484 --> 35:01.943
my government will fall.

35:01.944 --> 35:03.092
And you will be out of power,

35:03.093 --> 35:05.949
which, I'm just guessing,
is the real reason

35:05.950 --> 35:07.568
why you haven't gotten
on your plane yet.

35:08.984 --> 35:11.323
Things don't look good for you at home.

35:11.324 --> 35:14.323
If I were to give you
access to our bombs

35:14.324 --> 35:16.983
and it ever became public,

35:16.984 --> 35:18.483
I would be ousted.

35:18.484 --> 35:20.484
True.

35:23.324 --> 35:25.323
But you will definitely be ousted

35:25.324 --> 35:26.654
if you don't take this deal.

35:28.444 --> 35:30.443
If you want to take a
chance that I'm bluffing,

35:30.444 --> 35:31.533
that's your call.

35:31.534 --> 35:33.284
(sighs)

35:34.694 --> 35:37.194
♪ ♪

35:38.904 --> 35:40.243
So?

35:40.244 --> 35:42.283
Our chopper carrying Pakistan's nuke

35:42.284 --> 35:45.283
just crossed the border and
is landing at Pasha Base.

35:45.284 --> 35:48.944
(sighs) Well, that was easy.

35:50.244 --> 35:52.403
How did Khoosat take our demands?

35:52.404 --> 35:54.073
Well, let's just say I don't expect

35:54.074 --> 35:56.693
to be on his holiday card list anymore.

35:56.694 --> 35:59.693
Ephraim is already
coordinating with ISI.

35:59.694 --> 36:01.573
Pakistan <i>and</i> India now hate our guts.

36:01.574 --> 36:04.283
Though, officially,

36:04.284 --> 36:06.693
Khoosat is crowing
about standing up to India

36:06.694 --> 36:08.743
and restoring his nation's pride,

36:08.744 --> 36:12.073
while Verma is claiming the
mantle of great statesman,

36:12.074 --> 36:14.073
maintaining the peace

36:14.074 --> 36:16.073
while gaining economic
victories for her people.

36:16.074 --> 36:18.943
Our big peace deal is toast.

36:18.944 --> 36:20.943
Oh, give 'em ten years.

36:20.944 --> 36:22.283
They'll come around.

36:22.284 --> 36:23.757
JACKSON: In the meantime,

36:23.758 --> 36:28.403
access to Pakistan's
nuclear arsenal... is better.

36:28.404 --> 36:30.784
Better than peace?

36:34.944 --> 36:37.284
Another day.

36:43.194 --> 36:45.194
(upbeat music plays)

37:03.324 --> 37:05.864
What?

37:08.244 --> 37:11.074
Oh, I think that's him over
by the grim reaper piñata.

37:23.444 --> 37:24.444
Dr. Bachman?

37:24.445 --> 37:25.443
Yes?

37:25.444 --> 37:26.616
Excuse me. How do you do?

37:26.617 --> 37:30.283
I'm Nadine Tolliver, chief
of staff for Secretary McCord.

37:30.284 --> 37:31.943
This is Daisy Grant.

37:31.944 --> 37:33.823
I left several messages.

37:33.824 --> 37:36.483
Yes, you have a very intelligent voice,

37:36.484 --> 37:38.113
but I bet you get that all the time.

37:38.114 --> 37:39.113
Not really.

37:39.114 --> 37:41.533
Uh, mostly I just get a call back.

37:41.534 --> 37:43.113
Well, there wasn't any point.

37:43.114 --> 37:44.374
I know you were concerned

37:44.375 --> 37:46.472
about the Pakistan and India situation,

37:46.473 --> 37:48.822
but since it's been resolved,
you have to admit,

37:48.824 --> 37:51.823
it was a pretty substantial
move away from midnight.

37:51.824 --> 37:54.153
We're still moving the clock up.

37:54.154 --> 37:56.483
We don't base our decision
on just one event,

37:56.484 --> 37:57.983
rather on global trends.

37:57.984 --> 38:00.653
We understand that, Dr. Bachman,

38:00.654 --> 38:03.983
but it was no small feat
to avert that crisis.

38:03.984 --> 38:06.983
A lot of people made a lot
of intelligent moves.

38:06.984 --> 38:11.323
Yes, and that's why we're only
going up one minute not two.

38:11.324 --> 38:13.483
You're welcome.

38:13.484 --> 38:15.483
Now go get yourselves a drink.

38:15.484 --> 38:17.513
(whispering): I don't like
to talk shop at a party.

38:17.514 --> 38:18.903
- MAN: Dr. Bachman!
- Ah.

38:18.904 --> 38:20.244
(chuckles)

38:24.904 --> 38:27.243
I guess one is better than two.

38:27.244 --> 38:31.283
I had a feeling this whole
thing was a nonstarter.

38:31.284 --> 38:35.283
You can't dissuade people
with that much integrity.

38:35.284 --> 38:37.284
They're in the pocket of "Big Truth."

38:39.284 --> 38:40.613
I'll see you tomorrow.

38:40.614 --> 38:41.944
Okay.

38:50.244 --> 38:53.573
Okay, this is getting a little weird.

38:53.574 --> 38:55.903
You knew I'd be here
because of the calendar App.

38:55.904 --> 38:57.881
Well, yeah, but I'm here
because I was invited.

38:57.882 --> 38:59.159
I'm psyched to meet these people,

38:59.160 --> 39:01.242
and, to be honest,
they are excited to meet me.

39:01.244 --> 39:02.903
I'm sure.

39:02.904 --> 39:05.903
Listen, I know this isn't
exactly the right environment,

39:05.904 --> 39:08.803
but I have to bring up
something kind of awkward.

39:08.804 --> 39:10.693
This is exactly the right environment.

39:10.694 --> 39:11.693
Alcohol and geeks.

39:11.694 --> 39:13.153
This is about us.

39:13.154 --> 39:15.483
I know, the calendar App
is driving you crazy.

39:15.484 --> 39:16.823
We don't have to stick to it.

39:16.824 --> 39:17.814
I did manage to sell it though.

39:17.815 --> 39:18.850
I had to get that in there.

39:18.851 --> 39:20.782
WOMAN: Excuse me, you're Oliver Shaw?

39:20.784 --> 39:22.113
Suzan Simmons.

39:22.114 --> 39:23.443
So happy to meet you finally.

39:23.444 --> 39:25.113
(laughing): Oh, same here.

39:25.114 --> 39:26.404
- This is Daisy Grant.
- I know.

39:26.407 --> 39:28.617
Listen, my husband
is too drunk to dance,

39:28.618 --> 39:30.338
and I have to bust a move or go nuts.

39:30.339 --> 39:32.283
Again, I am your guy.
Uh, hold that thought.

Earl, I know you always think

that it can't be fixed...

42:18.526 --> 42:19.695
It doesn't need to be fixed.

42:19.696 --> 42:21.605
It's got a brand-new spin pulley in it.

42:21.606 --> 42:23.105
It's not the model I would have used,

42:23.106 --> 42:25.105

but works fine.

I hate to do it, but I'm on the clock.

42:31.196 --> 42:32.111
Not a problem.

42:32.112 --> 42:33.025
Have a good day.

42:33.026 --> 42:34.525
