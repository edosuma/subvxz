WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:03.291
HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO HAVE A DREAM
COME TRUE?

00:03.291 --> 00:05.458
WHY? DO I LOOK
LIKE I'M TRAPPED

00:05.458 --> 00:06.834
IN AN ELEVATOR
WITH KATE HUDSON?

00:06.834 --> 00:08.417
DAWSEY, COME ON.

00:08.417 --> 00:11.125
LAST NIGHT AT
THE HOLIDAY PARTY,
YOU KISSED GRETCHEN WITTER.

00:11.125 --> 00:12.542
I MEAN, YOU
REMEMBER HER, RIGHT?

00:12.542 --> 00:15.500
IT'S THE GIRL
YOU ONCE DESCRIBED TO ME
AS YOUR FIRST CRUSH.

00:15.500 --> 00:19.041
SHE PHOTOGRAPHS
VERY NICELY,
DOESN'T SHE?

00:19.041 --> 00:22.250
OK. AS MUCH AS I
APPRECIATE YOUR ATTEMPT
TO FEIGN COOLNESS,

00:22.250 --> 00:23.000
HA HA HA HA.
YOU CAN'T TELL ME

00:23.000 --> 00:25.291
THIS MEANS
NOTHING TO YOU.

00:25.291 --> 00:28.792
OH, NO, NOT NOTHING,
BUT, UH, YOU KNOW,
VIRTUALLY NOTHING.

00:28.792 --> 00:31.375
I MEAN,
WAS SHE ONCE
THE UNAPPROACHABLE,

00:31.375 --> 00:35.000
BIKINI-CLAD OBJECT
OF MY PREADOLESCENT
AFFECTION? YEAH.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.375
IS SHE NOW? NO.

00:36.375 --> 00:38.333
SHE'S A FRIEND.
I WOULD LIKE
TO KEEP HER ONE.

00:38.333 --> 00:40.500
UH-HUH.
FAMOUS LAST WORDS.

00:40.500 --> 00:41.500
NOT EVERY KISS
HAS TO BE

00:41.500 --> 00:42.667
A LIFE-ALTERING
EVENT.

00:42.667 --> 00:44.375
I KNOW.
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

00:44.375 --> 00:45.625
ALL RIGHT. I GOT TO GO.

00:45.625 --> 00:48.041
CAN YOU TAKE THIS
WITH YOU TO JEN'S HOUSE,

00:48.041 --> 00:49.125
GIVE IT TO GRAMS?

00:49.125 --> 00:50.583
HOW DO YOU KNOW
I'M GOING THERE?

00:50.583 --> 00:51.792
PLEASE?
YEAH, OK.

00:51.792 --> 00:53.166
WE'RE DRIVING UP
TO PROVINCETOWN.

00:53.166 --> 00:54.708
WE'RE GOING
TO SOMETHING CALLED

00:54.708 --> 00:56.208
A GAY-STRAIGHT
TEAM COALITION.

00:56.208 --> 00:58.333
IT SOUNDS
VAGUELY POLITICAL.

00:58.333 --> 01:00.041
YEAH. WELL,
THAT'S WHAT
I'M AFRAID OF.

01:00.041 --> 01:03.000
ANYWAY,
IT SHOULD BE
INTERESTING.

01:04.750 --> 01:06.417
Gretchen:
HEY! [CHUCKLES]

01:06.417 --> 01:07.625
HEY.

01:07.625 --> 01:10.542
I, UH, I CAME BY TO,
YOU KNOW, HELP CLEAN UP,

01:10.542 --> 01:12.708
SINCE IT WAS SORT OF
MY PARTY AND ALL.

01:12.708 --> 01:15.041
BUT YOU HAVE OBVIOUSLY
DONE THAT ALREADY.

01:15.041 --> 01:16.667
YEAH. SORRY.

01:18.208 --> 01:19.750
YEAH, OK,
I'M GOING TO GO.

01:19.750 --> 01:22.041
ALL RIGHT.

01:25.208 --> 01:26.417
LATER.
Gretchen: LATER.

01:27.708 --> 01:29.792
UH...

01:29.792 --> 01:32.083
UH, LOOK, DAWSON,
THE REASON I CAME BY

01:32.083 --> 01:33.542
WAS BECAUSE
I REACTED STUPIDLY.

01:33.542 --> 01:35.458
WHEN THE WHOLE MISTLETOE
THING HAPPENED,

01:35.458 --> 01:37.417
I SHOULD HAVE
CLEARED THE AIR
THEN AND THERE.

01:37.417 --> 01:39.291
THAT'S
SORT OF MY POLICY
ON THINGS LIKE THAT.

01:39.291 --> 01:42.375
YOU HAVE A POLICY ON KISSING
YOUR YOUNGER BROTHER'S
FORMER BEST FRIEND

01:42.375 --> 01:44.250
UNDERNEATH THE MISTLETOE
AT PARTIES?

01:44.250 --> 01:45.583
NO.

01:45.583 --> 01:49.083
NO. I JUST--I DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING AT THE TIME

01:49.083 --> 01:51.417
BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID
THAT YOU MIGHT THINK

01:51.417 --> 01:53.458
THAT IT MEANT
SOMETHING MORE
THAN IT DID.

01:53.458 --> 01:54.917
I MEAN,
YOU'RE YOUNG AND--

01:54.917 --> 01:56.250
WELL, I'M NOT THAT YOUNG.

01:56.250 --> 01:59.125
NO. NO, RIGHT.
OF COURSE NOT.

01:59.125 --> 02:01.959
SO OBVIOUSLY YOU DIDN'T

02:01.959 --> 02:02.750
THINK THAT
IT MEANT SOMETHING MORE.

02:02.750 --> 02:05.917
UM, OBVIOUSLY.

02:05.917 --> 02:08.708
BECAUSE SOMETIMES
IF WE DON'T CLEAR
THESE THINGS UP,

02:08.708 --> 02:11.458
THEN THEY CAN
GET KIND OF AWKWARD,
AND THAT WOULD SUCK.

02:11.458 --> 02:13.208
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

02:13.208 --> 02:16.291
SO TO SUM UP, UH,
LAST NIGHT WAS STRICTLY

02:16.291 --> 02:17.834
A SEASON'S GREETING
KIND OF A KISS.

02:17.834 --> 02:19.625
UH, YEAH.

02:19.625 --> 02:21.333
OK.

02:25.417 --> 02:30.083
WELL, UM...HAPPY HOLIDAYS.

02:30.083 --> 02:32.250
HAPPY HOLIDAYS.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.667
BYE. DON'T WORRY.

03:35.250 --> 03:37.041
YOU KNOW, THIS AIN'T
GOING TO BE HALF BAD.

03:37.041 --> 03:40.333
THE 2 OF US TOGETHER.
3 NIGHTS ALONE.

03:40.333 --> 03:43.625
YEAH, PACE, ALONE,
WITH A TODDLER
IN HIS TERRIBLE 2s

03:43.625 --> 03:44.875
AND A TEST TOMORROW
ON TRANSCENDENTALISM.

03:44.875 --> 03:47.917
IF THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE A PRESCRIPTION FOR FUN,

03:47.917 --> 03:50.542
I DON'T KNOW WHAT DOES.

03:50.542 --> 03:53.125
YOU KNOW, WE STILL HAVEN'T
TALKED ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

03:53.125 --> 03:55.625
SURE, WE DID. AND
WE'RE BOTH IN AGREEMENT

03:55.625 --> 03:56.667
THAT YOU WERE
THE HIT OF THE PARTY.

03:56.667 --> 03:59.208
NO, NOT THAT PARTY.
THE OTHER ONE.

03:59.208 --> 04:00.792
WHAT, THE LEERYS'?

04:00.792 --> 04:03.959
YES, THE LEERY PARTY.
YOU KNOW, THE ONE
WITH THE MISTLETOE

04:03.959 --> 04:05.875
WHERE DAWSON
WAS KISSING MY SISTER.

04:05.875 --> 04:07.000
LOOK, PACEY, PLEASE.

04:07.000 --> 04:07.959
I HAVE TOO MUCH ON
MY PLATE NOW

04:07.959 --> 04:09.208
TO EVEN THINK
ABOUT THAT, OK?

04:09.208 --> 04:10.500
I MEAN, I'M UP TO
MY EYEBALLS IN THOREAU,

04:10.500 --> 04:12.834
I HAVEN'T EVEN
STARTED EMERSON,

04:12.834 --> 04:13.708
AND WE
HAVE AN HOUR LEFT

04:13.708 --> 04:15.583
UNTIL ALEXANDER
WAKES UP

04:15.583 --> 04:16.166
FROM HIS NAP
IF WE'RE LUCKY.

04:16.166 --> 04:18.625
[ALEXANDER CRIES]

04:18.625 --> 04:21.625
BRACE YOURSELF. THIS IS
WHERE THE FUN BEGINS.

04:24.208 --> 04:25.542
TAKE A LOOK AROUND
PLEASE.

04:25.542 --> 04:27.208
THIS IS TOTALLY
NOT MY SCENE.

04:27.208 --> 04:28.708
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

04:28.708 --> 04:30.750
LOOK HERE.
FOR ONE THING--

04:30.750 --> 04:33.041
ONE THING,
I'M THE ONLY
GUY HERE

04:33.041 --> 04:34.166
WITH NO
PIERCINGS.

04:34.166 --> 04:36.917
JACK, YOUR SCENE, AS YOU
SO QUAINTLY REFER TO IT,

04:36.917 --> 04:40.583
BASICALLY CONSISTS OF ME,
DAWSON, AND IT PAINS ME
TO SAY IT, GRAMS.

04:40.583 --> 04:42.083
LOOK, I KNOW THAT
THIS IS HARD FOR YOU,

04:42.083 --> 04:45.750
BUT YOU CANNOT
SPEND YOUR ENTIRE LIFE
SURROUNDED BY STRAIGHT PEOPLE.

04:45.750 --> 04:49.792
HI. UH, CAN I GET
2 SKINNY VANILLA LATTES,
EXTRA HOT, NO FOAM?

04:49.792 --> 04:51.875
HEY, YOU HERE
FOR THE MEETING?

04:51.875 --> 04:53.667
YES, WE ARE.

04:53.667 --> 04:55.250
OOH, THANK GOD.

04:55.250 --> 04:56.291
WE NEED
MORE LESBIANS

04:56.291 --> 04:57.542
WITH DESCENT
HAIRCUTS.

04:57.542 --> 04:58.792
I'M TOBEY.

04:58.792 --> 05:02.417
JEN. UH, BUT I'M ACTUALLY
JUST HERE AS A FRIEND.

05:02.417 --> 05:04.875
JACK, TOBEY. TOBEY, JACK.

05:04.875 --> 05:06.708
HAVE WE MET?

05:06.708 --> 05:07.792
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

05:07.792 --> 05:10.250
I'VE DEFINITELY
SEEN YOU
IN SOMETHING.

05:10.250 --> 05:12.000
I KNOW,
YOU'RE THE GAY
FOOTBALL PLAYER.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.291
UH, UH,
LAST YEAR
FROM THE NEWS.

05:13.291 --> 05:14.792
WE ALWAYS
WONDERED
ABOUT YOU.

05:14.792 --> 05:18.083
HEY, UH,
I'M SORRY.
WAS I WRONG?

05:18.083 --> 05:19.750
YOU'RE
NOT THE GAY
FOOTBALL PLAYER?

05:19.750 --> 05:21.625
NO, NO. I AM.
IT'S JUST I'M
NOT COMFORTABLE

05:21.625 --> 05:22.708
WITH LABELS
LIKE THAT. SO--

05:22.708 --> 05:25.125
I SEE.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.458
AND WHICH
LABEL BOTHERS
YOU MORE?

05:27.458 --> 05:29.542
GAY OR
FOOTBALL PLAYER?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.667
A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT ME.
AND WHAT DO YOU GET OUT OF IT?

05:35.667 --> 05:38.375
I GET
A CHANCE TO LEARN
ABOUT FILMMAKING.

05:38.375 --> 05:39.667
PICTURE-MAKING.
SORRY.

05:39.667 --> 05:41.625
A LOT OF DIRECTORS
HAVE DEDICATED THEMSELVES

05:41.625 --> 05:43.625
TO STUDYING
THEIR CINEMATIC
FOREBEARS.

05:43.625 --> 05:45.834
TRUFFAUT AND HITCHCOCK.
BOGDANOVICH AND JOHN FORD.

05:45.834 --> 05:47.333
BILLY WILDER
AND CAMERON CROWE.

05:47.333 --> 05:49.333
I KNOW YOU NEVER
HEARD OF HIM.

05:49.333 --> 05:52.667
I LIED. TALENTED FELLA,
SHAGGY-HAIRED.

05:52.667 --> 05:58.000
DOESN'T HOLD A CANDLE TO,
UH, HANDSOME FELLA,
L.A. CONFIDENTIAL.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.750
BEST PICTURE
OF THE NINETIES.

05:59.750 --> 06:02.000
SO YOU HAVE BEEN
TO THE MOVIES
SINCE STAR WARS.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.959
MY A.A.R.P. CARD GIVES ME
A NICE DISCOUNT AT THE RIALTO.

06:04.959 --> 06:07.667
SO WHAT MAKES
L.A. CONFIDENTIAL  SO GREAT?

06:07.667 --> 06:08.875
YOU REALLY
WANT TO KNOW?

06:08.875 --> 06:10.000
I WOULDN'T BE HERE
IF I DIDN'T.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.333
COME BACK TOMORROW
TO LESSON NUMBER ONE

06:12.333 --> 06:14.166
OF THE A.I. BROOKS
SCHOOL OF CINEMA.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.208
SO YOU'LL DO IT?

06:16.208 --> 06:17.500
PRODUCER CREDIT
ABOVE THE TITLE.

06:17.500 --> 06:19.000
YOU'D BE DIRECTOR
IN NAME ONLY.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.083
LIKE FLEMING IN
GONE WITH THE WIND.

06:21.083 --> 06:22.166
YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?

06:22.166 --> 06:24.041
NO PROBLEM AT ALL.

06:24.041 --> 06:25.333
Man: ...BECAUSE
HE WAS GAY.

06:25.333 --> 06:27.667
OH, GOD. IF I HEAR
THE WORD GAY ONE MORE TIME,

06:27.667 --> 06:28.708
I'M GOING TO SCREAM.

06:28.708 --> 06:29.875
JACK, IT'S JUST A WORD.

06:29.875 --> 06:32.041
IT'S IN EVERY SENTENCE
THE GUY SAYS.

06:32.041 --> 06:34.000
SO--OUR NEW PEOPLE--

06:34.000 --> 06:35.125
JACK, WASN'T IT?

06:35.125 --> 06:38.083
WHY THE, UH, SUDDEN
INTEREST IN JOINING

06:38.083 --> 06:39.542
OUR LITTLE
COFFEE KLATSCH?

06:39.542 --> 06:42.875
WELL, I--I, UH--
UP!

06:42.875 --> 06:44.041
ON YOUR FEET.

06:44.041 --> 06:49.291
AHEM. I WAS, UH, COACHING
A PEE-WEE SOCCER TEAM

06:49.291 --> 06:50.834
OVER IN CAPESIDE, AND I--

06:50.834 --> 06:53.458
SAY NO MORE.
AND THE PARENTS
FIRED YOU

06:53.458 --> 06:54.792
WHEN THEY FOUND OUT
YOU WERE QUEER?

06:54.792 --> 06:57.041
THOUGH, OF COURSE,
THEY WERE
VERY CAREFUL

06:57.041 --> 06:59.083
NOT TO FIRE YOU
BECAUSE
YOU WERE QUEER.

06:59.083 --> 07:01.083
I WOULDN'T EXACTLY
PUT IT THAT WAY.

07:01.083 --> 07:03.250
BUT IT'S
WHAT HAPPENED,
ISN'T IT?

07:03.250 --> 07:05.291
SO, UH,
WHAT'D YOU DO?

07:05.291 --> 07:07.583
I DID THE ONLY THING
I COULD. I--I LEFT.

07:07.583 --> 07:08.625
BUT YOU
DIDN'T PROTEST.

07:08.625 --> 07:09.917
YOU DIDN'T
PUT UP A FIGHT.

07:09.917 --> 07:11.875
NOT EXACTLY
A STEP FORWARD
FOR GAY RIGHTS.

07:11.875 --> 07:14.750
I WASN'T THINKING ABOUT
GAY RIGHTS AT THE TIME.

07:14.750 --> 07:16.583
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT THE KIDS.

07:16.583 --> 07:19.834
AH, OF COURSE.
THOUGH AS EVERYBODY
HERE KNOWS,

07:19.834 --> 07:21.750
THE ONLY WAY
TO MAKE SOCIETY
ANY BETTER

07:21.750 --> 07:25.250
IS TO CONFRONT
PREJUDICE HEAD-ON.

07:25.250 --> 07:28.625
WHICH BRINGS ME
TO OUR LAST ORDER
OF BUSINESS.

07:28.625 --> 07:30.750
YOU CAN
SIT DOWN NOW.

07:30.750 --> 07:34.375
AS THOSE OF YOU
WHO READ MORE THAN
JUST THE SPORTS PAGES NOW,

07:34.375 --> 07:37.125
2 OF OUR FAVORITE LESBIANS,
ANNA AND SARAH,

07:37.125 --> 07:39.166
GOT KICKED OUT
OF STARDUST LANES
IN UPPER WEYMOUTH LAST WEEK

07:39.166 --> 07:41.166
FOR KISSING.

07:41.166 --> 07:42.792
THE OWNERS CLAIM
THAT THEY'RE AGAINST

07:42.792 --> 07:44.792
ALL FORMS OF PUBLIC
DISPLAYS OF AFFECTION,

07:44.792 --> 07:46.458
GAY OR STRAIGHT.

07:46.458 --> 07:48.750
AND WE PLAN TO PUT
THIS POLICY TO A TEST.

07:48.750 --> 07:50.542
GOD FORBID
FUTURE GENERATIONS
OF GAY TEENAGERS

07:50.542 --> 07:52.959
ARE DENIED
THE RIGHT TO BOWL.

07:52.959 --> 07:55.125
JACK, WE'RE KEEPING
AN OPEN MIND HERE, OK?

07:55.125 --> 07:56.250
MM-MMM.
I'M SORRY.

07:56.250 --> 07:58.250
UH, YOU TWO
IN THE BACK?

07:58.250 --> 07:59.417
DO YOU GUYS
HAVE SOMETHING

07:59.417 --> 08:00.959
YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE
WITH THE GROUP?

08:00.959 --> 08:04.834
YEAH, NO.
WE WERE JUST WONDERING
WHAT TIME FOR BOWLING.

08:07.125 --> 08:11.125
[CLANGING]

08:20.166 --> 08:22.333
WHAT, MAY I ASK,
IS GOING ON IN HERE?

08:22.333 --> 08:24.959
WELL, WE'RE JUST DOING
SOME REORGANIZING.

08:24.959 --> 08:26.750
WHAT HAPPENED
TO READING HIM
TO SLEEP?

08:26.750 --> 08:29.625
WELL, HE GOT A LITTLE ANTSY.
I JUST--I LET HIM
TIRE HIMSELF OUT.

08:29.625 --> 08:31.333
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
BETTER, PACEY.

08:31.333 --> 08:33.166
YOU ALWAYS DO THIS.

08:33.166 --> 08:34.750
WHAT?

08:34.750 --> 08:36.207
YOU GET HIM
ALL RILED UP,

08:36.207 --> 08:37.500
NOW HE'LL
NEVER GET TO SLEEP,

08:37.500 --> 08:39.000
AND I'LL NEVER GET
A CHANCE TO STUDY.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.332
YOU CAN STUDY RIGHT NOW.
I'M TELLING YOU.

08:40.332 --> 08:43.833
I GOT THIS WHOLE
BABY PUTTING-TO-BED
THING UNDER CONTROL.

08:43.833 --> 08:45.000
OUT.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
WHAT? OF THE KITCHEN?

08:46.000 --> 08:47.125
NO, OF THE HOUSE.

08:47.125 --> 08:48.375
AS IN GOOD-BYE,
SAYONARA.

08:48.375 --> 08:51.000
YOU'RE SLEEPING
AT HOME TONIGHT. YOUR HOME.

08:51.000 --> 08:51.959
NO. WAIT.
YOU CAN'T
KICK ME OUT.

08:51.959 --> 08:53.834
YOU NEED
ME HERE.
NO, I DON'T.

08:53.834 --> 08:54.750
YES, YOU DO.

08:54.750 --> 08:57.291
HAT.
OW, OW, HAIR!
FACE! OK!

08:57.291 --> 08:58.583
COAT.
WHAT IS IT?

08:58.583 --> 09:00.959
LOOK, I CAN PUT ON
MY OWN CLOTHES.

09:00.959 --> 09:02.625
LOOK, PACE, LOOK.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.000
I APPRECIATE THAT

MEANING TO ASK YOU.

YOU HAD TO KISS DAWSON

TO TALK ABOUT THIS

JUST A KISS.

AS "JUST A KISS."

THAT I KNOW DOES.

TO HER INSTEAD
OF HARASSING ME

WHAT SHE'S TELLING ME,

11:26.834 --> 11:31.166

FORCE THE ISSUE,

IMPOSSIBLE, OK?

OF ITS EXISTENCE,

THE SAME SEXUAL ORIENTATION

IS WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN DAWSON AND GRETCHEN.

18:30.625 --> 18:33.959
UH, I AM NOT UPSET ABOUT
DAWSON AND GRETCHEN.

18:33.959 --> 18:35.417
NO, OK.
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT,

18:35.417 --> 18:39.166
BUT YOU ARE CERTAINLY
UPSET ABOUT DAWSON AND YOU.

18:41.959 --> 18:44.250
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

18:45.125 --> 18:47.625
THAT'S NOT TRUE?
NO.

18:47.625 --> 18:49.625
THEN PLEASE
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

18:49.625 --> 18:52.000
BECAUSE IT'S CERTAINLY NOT
ABOUT YOU AND ME, YOU KNOW.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.917
I HAVEN'T SCREWED UP
FOR AT LEAST A DAY OR 2.

18:53.917 --> 18:55.959
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU
HAVEN'T. YOU NEVER DO.

18:55.959 --> 18:57.667
YOU ARE
THE PERFECT BOYFRIEND,

18:57.667 --> 18:59.125
AND YOU WIN THE PERFECT
BOYFRIEND CONTEST.

18:59.125 --> 19:02.458
YOU BEAT DAWSON.
IS THAT WHAT YOU
WANT TO HEAR, PACEY?

19:06.792 --> 19:08.041
[ALEXANDER FUSSES]

19:21.834 --> 19:24.000
IS HE ASLEEP?

19:24.000 --> 19:26.041
YEP.

19:26.041 --> 19:28.583
I DID THE DISHES.
THANKS.

19:28.583 --> 19:30.500
YOU KNOW,
I DIDN'T COME
OVER HERE TONIGHT

19:30.500 --> 19:31.708
TO FIGHT
ABOUT DAWSON.

19:31.708 --> 19:32.458
YES, YOU DID.

19:32.458 --> 19:35.750
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:35.750 --> 19:37.959
I DID COME
OVER HERE TO FIGHT
ABOUT DAWSON.

19:37.959 --> 19:39.500
BUT ONLY BECAUSE
I DON'T WANT THIS

19:39.500 --> 19:41.708
TO BECOME ONE
OF THOSE THINGS THAT
WE NEVER TALK ABOUT,

19:41.708 --> 19:43.834
THEN I
LOOK UP ONE DAY
AND YOU'RE GONE.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.875
WHAT THINGS, PACEY?

19:45.875 --> 19:47.542
OH, THINGS
LIKE THE FUTURE.

19:47.542 --> 19:49.667
WE TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE.

19:49.667 --> 19:51.375
NO, JOEY, WE TALK
AROUND THE FUTURE.

19:51.375 --> 19:53.166
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

19:53.166 --> 19:54.458
[SIGHS]

19:54.458 --> 19:56.834
[SIGHS]

19:56.834 --> 19:58.166
I DON'T KNOW WHY
IT SHOULD BOTHER ME,

19:58.166 --> 20:01.041
THIS DAWSON
AND GRETCHEN THING.

20:01.041 --> 20:04.000
BUT IT
DOES BOTHER YOU.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.625
IT'S OK
THAT IT BOTHERS YOU.

20:06.625 --> 20:09.250
I JUST
WANT YOU TO BE ABLE
TO TELL ME THAT.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.542
DON'T SHUT ME OUT
FROM THESE THINGS.

20:11.542 --> 20:16.000
PACEY, I DO THINK
ABOUT THE FUTURE.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.041
I DO.

20:18.041 --> 20:20.875
SO WHAT
DO YOU SEE WHEN
YOU SEE THE FUTURE?

20:20.875 --> 20:23.542
US.

20:23.542 --> 20:28.041
ME AND YOU, PACE.
WE GREW UP TOGETHER.

20:28.041 --> 20:31.208
AND SEE, DAWSON AND I,
WE DIDN'T GROW UP.

20:31.208 --> 20:33.834
WE ARE IN THAT HOUSE,
IN DAWSON'S BEDROOM,

20:33.834 --> 20:36.291
ETERNALLY HAVING
THE SAME ARGUMENT
OVER AND OVER AGAIN

20:36.291 --> 20:38.458
IN THIS ENDLESS CYCLE
THAT GOES ON AND ON.

20:38.458 --> 20:42.000
AND...I CAN'T STOP IT.

20:42.000 --> 20:46.542
BECAUSE WHENEVER I'M AROUND
HIM, I BECOME 15 AGAIN.

20:46.542 --> 20:53.542
WELL, AHEM, IF
THAT'S THE PROBLEM,

20:53.542 --> 20:56.625
AND, BELIEVE ME,
THIS ISN'T EASY
FOR ME TO SAY,

20:56.625 --> 21:00.708
YOU HAVE
TO TALK TO DAWSON.

21:00.708 --> 21:03.542
AND THEN WOULD YOU
PLEASE CALL ME?

21:11.166 --> 21:13.125
[KISS]

21:17.667 --> 21:19.625
I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW YOU AND MR. QUARTERBACK

21:19.625 --> 21:21.125
GOT TO BE
SUCH GOOD FRIENDS.

21:21.125 --> 21:23.834
UH, SIMPLE.
WE'RE BOTH TERMINALLY
UNLUCKY IN LOVE.

21:23.834 --> 21:26.250
OH, AND HE--HE'S
NOT THE QUARTERBACK.

21:26.250 --> 21:29.917
HE--THEY THROW HIM THE
BALL AND HE CATCHES IT.

21:29.917 --> 21:34.875
AH, A LOVE OF SPORTS.
NO WONDER WE GET ALONG
SO FAMOUSLY.

21:36.542 --> 21:40.542
AH, THERE HE IS.
CAPTAIN AMERICA.

21:40.542 --> 21:42.250
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
HE WASN'T COMING.

21:42.250 --> 21:46.500
HE WASN'T. I KIND OF
BLACKMAILED HIM
INTO IT.

21:46.500 --> 21:49.917
JACK. HELLO.
OVER HERE.

21:49.917 --> 21:52.000
HEY.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.458
Jen: HEY,
YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND.

21:53.458 --> 21:54.375
AH, FAKE SURPRISE.
IT LOOKS GOOD
ON YOU.

21:54.375 --> 21:56.250
TOBEY,
YOU REMEMBER JACK?

21:56.250 --> 21:58.291
YEAH, HOW
COULD I FORGET?

21:58.291 --> 21:59.291
NICE JACKET.

21:59.291 --> 22:01.500
OH, YEAH, THANKS.

22:01.500 --> 22:03.333
HE'S KIDDING, RIGHT?

22:03.333 --> 22:05.291
ABOUT WHAT?

22:05.291 --> 22:07.417
THE JACKET. I MEAN,
IT'S, LIKE, IRONIC, RIGHT?

22:07.417 --> 22:10.542
OR SOMETHING. HE GOT IT
AT A THRIFT STORE.

22:10.542 --> 22:13.083
NO, NO, THAT'S
REALLY HIS JACKET.

22:13.083 --> 22:14.834
WHAT, IS THERE
A PROBLEM?

22:14.834 --> 22:17.417
UH-UH, NO.

22:17.417 --> 22:18.917
NO, NO, BUT I THINK
IT'S TIME TO BOWL.

22:18.917 --> 22:21.875
TOBEY. PINK.

22:21.875 --> 22:24.333
HMM.

22:27.792 --> 22:28.750
HE IS SWEET,
HUH?

22:28.750 --> 22:32.875
HEH. I'LL
GET SOME SHOES.

22:32.875 --> 22:35.792
Mr. Brooks:
I STARTED HITCHHIKING
TO THE WEST COAST.

22:35.792 --> 22:38.708
IT WAS OUT OF CHICAGO
I HOOKED UP
WITH ROUTE 66.

22:38.708 --> 22:40.708
YOU'VE HEARD OF THAT,
HAVEN'T YOU?

22:40.708 --> 22:41.708
YEAH, SURE.

22:41.708 --> 22:43.291
THE TV SHOW, NO DOUBT.

22:43.291 --> 22:45.166
BET YOU HAVEN'T READ
GRAPES OF WRATH,
EITHER.

22:45.166 --> 22:48.125
I SAW THE MOVIE.

22:48.125 --> 22:49.917
HOW COME I'M NOT
SURPRISED BY THAT?

22:49.917 --> 22:54.500
AH, JOHN HUSTON. NOW,
THERE WAS A DIRECTOR.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.542
JOHN FORD DIRECTED
THE GRAPES OF WRATH.

22:56.542 --> 22:57.750
DIRECTED ALL THOSE EARLY
HENRY FONDA MOVIES.

22:57.750 --> 22:59.667
YOUNG MR. LINCOLN,
DRUMS ALONG THE MOHAWK.

22:59.667 --> 23:02.041
OH, YEAH,
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

23:02.041 --> 23:03.583
HUSTON DIDN'T MAKE
HIS FIRST PICTURE

23:03.583 --> 23:05.542
TILL TREASURE
OF SIERRA MADRE.

23:05.542 --> 23:08.708
MALTESE FALCON,  YEAH.

23:08.708 --> 23:13.333
THAT WAS HUSTON'S
FIRST PICTURE,
NOT SIERRA MADRE.

23:13.333 --> 23:15.041
MR. BROOKS, IF
YOU'RE NOT FEELING WELL,

23:15.041 --> 23:16.333
WE CAN DO THIS
SOME OTHER TIME.

23:16.333 --> 23:19.750
UM, CAN I GET YOU
SOME WATER OR SOMETHING?

23:19.750 --> 23:22.708
OH, THAT'D BE GOOD,
YEAH. WATER, ICE,
BOURBON.

23:22.708 --> 23:23.834
HOLD THE WATER,
HOLD THE ICE.

23:23.834 --> 23:27.125
UH, NOT QUITE SURE
THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

23:27.125 --> 23:30.000
I DON'T GIVE
A TINKER'S DAMN
ABOUT YOUR OPINION.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.458
IF IT'S TOO MUCH
TROUBLE FOR YOU,
I CAN GET IT MYSELF.

23:32.458 --> 23:34.625
NEVER MIND.
SIT RIGHT THERE.
I'LL GET IT.

24:18.291 --> 24:19.917
JACK, ARE YOU
EMBARRASSED TO BE HERE?

24:19.917 --> 24:24.250
ON GAY BOWLING NIGHT?
YEAH, I'M EMBARRASSED.

24:24.250 --> 24:26.375
NOT THE GAY THING,
THOUGH. THE BOWLING.

24:26.375 --> 24:27.583
ALL RIGHT,
I'M WITH YOU.

24:27.583 --> 24:30.000
I ADMIT,
THE BOWLING THING
IS KINDA WACK,

24:30.000 --> 24:32.458
BUT, YOU KNOW,
ITS HEART IS
IN THE RIGHT PLACE,

24:32.458 --> 24:33.750
AND PEOPLE
NEED TO BE WILLING

24:33.750 --> 24:35.291
TO STAND UP FOR
WHAT THEY BELIEVE IN.

24:35.291 --> 24:39.125
YOU'RE BEGINNING
TO SOUND LIKE
YOUR NEW FRIEND TOBEY.

24:39.125 --> 24:42.041
HOW IS
CAPTAIN AMERICA
DOING?

24:43.291 --> 24:46.333
OH, MY GOD,
HE'S EVEN GOOD
AT BOWLING.

24:47.542 --> 24:51.291
WELL, I'M THIRSTY.
UM, YOU?

24:51.291 --> 24:52.708
YEAH.
YOU?

24:52.708 --> 24:53.667
NO, THANKS.

25:00.458 --> 25:03.959
YOU KNOW,
I'M GONNA BITE.

25:03.959 --> 25:04.834
CAPTAIN AMERICA?

25:04.834 --> 25:06.792
SUPERHERO.
MARVEL COMIC.

25:06.792 --> 25:10.000
DON'T WORRY,
IT'S A COMPLIMENT.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.250
HE'S NOT GAY
OR ANYTHING.

25:11.250 --> 25:14.166
OH, OK, I SEE. THAT'S WHAT
YOUR COMMENTS ARE ABOUT.

25:14.166 --> 25:15.625
I'M NOT GAY ENOUGH
FOR YOU?

25:15.625 --> 25:18.208
I DON'T FIT INTO SOME
PRE-EXISTING STEREOTYPE
IN YOUR HEAD?

25:18.208 --> 25:20.166
I SEE. IS, UH,
IS ALL THIS

25:20.166 --> 25:21.667
GETTING A LITTLE
TOO GAY FOR YOU?

25:21.667 --> 25:25.417
YEAH, AS A MATTER
OF FACT, IT IS GETTING
A LITTLE TOO GAY FOR ME.

25:25.417 --> 25:30.542
I GOTTA--I GOTTA ADMIT,
I--I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE POINT TO IT.

25:30.542 --> 25:33.166
TO YOUR GROUP,
TO THE WAY YOU GUYS ACT,

25:33.166 --> 25:35.333
TO YOUR WHOLE
HOLIER-THAN-THOU
ATTITUDE.

25:35.333 --> 25:36.667
YOU WOULDN'T.

25:36.667 --> 25:38.166
I MEAN, NOT FROM
WHERE YOU'RE SITTING

25:38.166 --> 25:39.375
AT THE FUN
AND POPULAR TABLE

25:39.375 --> 25:41.250
WITH THE FOOTBALL PLAYERS
AND CHEERLEADERS.

25:41.250 --> 25:44.125
BUT IN THE REAL WORLD,
THE ONE THAT THE REST
OF US LIVE IN,

25:44.125 --> 25:47.250
PEOPLE WHO FIT IN,
LIKE YOU, BEAT UP PEOPLE
WHO DON'T, LIKE ME.

25:47.250 --> 25:49.583
BUT YOU DON'T GET THAT,
DO YOU?

25:49.583 --> 25:51.208
YOU'VE PROBABLY
NEVER HAD A ROUGH DAY

25:51.208 --> 25:52.208
IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

25:52.208 --> 25:53.542
HEY, YOU DON'T
KNOW ME WELL ENOUGH

25:53.542 --> 25:55.708
TO ASSUME
ANYTHING ABOUT ME

25:55.708 --> 25:57.250
OR HOW ROUGH
IT'S BEEN FOR ME

25:57.250 --> 25:59.250
OR--OR WHAT
MY LIFE IS LIKE

25:59.250 --> 26:00.834
OR WHAT IT'S COST ME
TO GET WHERE I AM.

26:00.834 --> 26:02.834
WHICH IS WHERE,
EXACTLY?

26:05.041 --> 26:06.750
ANYWHERE BUT HERE.

26:18.583 --> 26:20.125
HEY.

26:20.125 --> 26:21.417
HEY, DAWSON.

26:21.417 --> 26:23.166
UM, YOUR MOM SAID
YOU'D BE HOME SOON,

26:23.166 --> 26:25.083
SO I THOUGHT I'D WAIT.
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND.

26:25.083 --> 26:26.583
NO.

26:26.583 --> 26:28.542
I BROUGHT YOU
THESE COUNTING CROWS CDs.

26:28.542 --> 26:30.959
JOEY, THESE ARE YOURS.

26:30.959 --> 26:34.083
I KNOW, I--WELL,
I JUST FIGURED THAT WE COULD
PASS THEM BACK AND FORTH

26:34.083 --> 26:36.542
WHENEVER WE HAD SOMETHING
WE NEEDED TO DISCUSS.

26:36.542 --> 26:39.959
OK. UH, WHAT DO YOU
NEED TO DISCUSS?

26:42.000 --> 26:47.959
SEE, THIS AFTERNOON,
IN KASDAN'S CLASS, I LIED.

26:47.959 --> 26:50.333
I WASN'T OK.

26:50.333 --> 26:55.125
I TOTALLY
BLEW THAT TEST.

26:55.125 --> 26:57.000
YOU KNOW, BESSIE AND BODIE,
THEY WERE GONE,

26:57.000 --> 26:59.917
AND--AND SUDDENLY THESE PEOPLE
JUST SHOWED UP AT THE B&B.

26:59.917 --> 27:00.750
AND I HAD TO GET
ALL THESE ROOMS READY,

27:00.750 --> 27:02.166
I HAD
TO TAKE CARE OF ALEXANDER,

27:02.166 --> 27:05.583
AND I TRIED TO STAY UP
ALL NIGHT CRAMMING,
BUT I FELL ASLEEP

27:05.583 --> 27:10.291
SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE
OF CHAPTER 7, "THE BEAN FIELD."

27:10.291 --> 27:13.291
DON'T LAUGH.
THIS IS TRAGIC.

27:13.291 --> 27:15.208
YOU'RE GONNA DIE IF
YOU GET A "B" ON A TEST.

27:15.208 --> 27:18.625
BASICALLY.

27:18.625 --> 27:22.250
WELL, HOW DID YOU GET
INTO THAT SITUATION
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

27:22.250 --> 27:24.500
WASN'T PACEY WITH YOU?

27:24.500 --> 27:26.834
YEAH.

27:26.834 --> 27:30.250
AND HE WASN'T HELPING?

27:30.250 --> 27:32.583
UM, I KINDA
WOULDN'T LET HIM.

27:32.583 --> 27:35.500
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD
HAVE LET PACEY HELP YOU.

27:35.500 --> 27:38.000
ESPECIALLY WITH ALEXANDER.
I MEAN, HE'S GREAT WITH KIDS.

27:38.000 --> 27:39.500
MOSTLY 'CAUSE
HE STILL IS ONE.

27:39.500 --> 27:42.041
I MEANT THAT
IN A GOOD WAY.

27:42.041 --> 27:46.959
UM, HERE. OPEN
YOUR CHRISTMAS PRESENT.

27:46.959 --> 27:48.875
DAWSON, YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE DONE THIS.

27:48.875 --> 27:51.917
I DON'T HAVE YOURS.
IT'S NOT CHRISTMAS YET.

27:51.917 --> 27:52.792
I KNOW. OPEN IT.

28:12.834 --> 28:15.166
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

28:15.166 --> 28:16.834
YEAH, I'M GETTIN'
BETTER, AREN'T I?

28:16.834 --> 28:19.792
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT. I--

28:19.792 --> 28:22.500
I MEANT--
I KNOW
WHAT YOU MEANT.

28:32.542 --> 28:36.333
THE PARTY WAS FUN.

28:36.333 --> 28:40.291
UH, YEAH.
HAD ITS MOMENTS.

28:40.291 --> 28:43.208
LIKE YOU AND GRETCHEN.

28:43.208 --> 28:47.792
UM, THAT WAS
NOT A MOMENT.

28:47.792 --> 28:52.375
THAT WAS MERELY
A HOLIDAY TRADITION.

28:54.875 --> 28:57.542
SO, WHAT'S THE DEAL?

28:57.542 --> 29:00.208
YOU GUYS FRIENDS OR--

29:00.208 --> 29:02.583
YEAH, WE'RE FRIENDS.
WHAT ELSE WOULD WE BE?

29:02.583 --> 29:05.291
I THOUGHT SINCE
YOU GUYS WERE KISSING--

29:05.291 --> 29:06.875
AH, PLEASE.

29:06.875 --> 29:09.750
SOPHISTICATED, COOL,
21-YEAR-OLD COLLEGE GIRLS

29:09.750 --> 29:11.792
DON'T GENERALLY FALL FOR
DORKY HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS.

29:11.792 --> 29:15.333
SO, YOU'RE NOT
INTERESTED IN HER?

29:15.333 --> 29:19.250
EVEN IF I WERE, SHE'S
NOT INTERESTED IN ME,

29:19.250 --> 29:22.959
SO WHY RUIN A PERFECTLY
GOOD FRIENDSHIP?

29:22.959 --> 29:28.375
THESE THINGS DON'T ALWAYS
HAVE TO WORK THAT WAY.

29:28.375 --> 29:35.834
LOOK AT US. AFTER ALL THAT'S
HAPPENED? AND WE'RE FRIENDS.

29:35.834 --> 29:38.125
IF WE WEREN'T,
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE...

29:43.125 --> 29:45.792
YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE GIVEN ME THIS.

29:46.917 --> 29:50.583
AND I WOULDN'T
BE SITTING HERE

29:50.583 --> 29:56.333
TELLING YOU TO DO
WHATEVER YOUR HEART
TELLS YOU TO DO.

29:56.333 --> 30:05.000
TRUTH IS, GRETCHEN
WOULD BE REALLY LUCKY
TO HAVE SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

30:05.000 --> 30:08.208
HMM.

30:16.458 --> 30:18.500
THANK YOU.

30:28.583 --> 30:31.708
HA! PACEY WITTER.

30:31.708 --> 30:35.208
I THOUGHT WE WEREN'T
DESTINED TO MEET TODAY
UNTIL FOURTH PERIOD.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.500
OR WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HANG AROUND
IN JUNIOR ENGLISH

30:37.500 --> 30:40.166
AND HAVE ANOTHER GO
AT BARTLEBY THE SCRIVENER?

30:40.166 --> 30:42.417
UH, NO, THANKS.
MM-HMM.

30:42.417 --> 30:44.417
I SHOULD PREFER
NOT TO.

30:44.417 --> 30:50.166
BARTLEBY-BASED HUMOR.
VERY IMPRESSIVE, MR. WITTER.

30:50.166 --> 30:52.708
SO WHAT CAN I
HELP YOU WITH?

30:52.708 --> 30:55.333
WELL, UH, YOU GUYS
IN A.P. ENGLISH

30:55.333 --> 30:58.000
HAD A TEST
YESTERDAY, RIGHT?
A BIG TEST.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.083
YEAH.

30:59.083 --> 31:01.917
WELL, LET'S SUPPOSE
FOR A MOMENT

31:01.917 --> 31:05.583
THAT YOU HAD
THIS PERSON
IN YOUR CLASS

31:05.583 --> 31:06.333
WHO IS NORMALLY
A PHENOMENAL STUDENT--

31:06.333 --> 31:08.667
HE OR SHE?

31:08.667 --> 31:11.333
YOU THINK WE COULD
KEEP IT AT "THEY"
FOR RIGHT NOW?

31:11.333 --> 31:13.834
JUST FOR ARGUMENT'S
SAKE, REMAIN
GENDER-NEUTRAL?

31:13.834 --> 31:16.125
AND CONTRIBUTE
TO THE FURTHER CORRUPTION
OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE

31:16.125 --> 31:19.208
AS IT IS SPOKEN
ON THE NORTH AMERICAN
CONTINENT.

31:19.208 --> 31:20.291
PLEASE, BY ALL MEANS.

31:20.291 --> 31:26.166
OK. LET'S SUPPOSE
THAT THIS PERSON

31:26.166 --> 31:27.625
NEEDED TO RETAKE
THAT TEST.

31:27.625 --> 31:28.625
BECAUSE OF ILLNESS?

31:28.625 --> 31:30.542
NO--
FAMILY EMERGENCY?

31:30.542 --> 31:31.625
NO, NOT EXACTLY.

31:31.625 --> 31:35.542
WELL, THEN, CASE CLOSED.

31:35.542 --> 31:36.500
MR. KASDAN,
IF YOU COULD JUST

31:36.500 --> 31:38.208
HEAR ME OUT
FOR ONE SECOND.

31:38.208 --> 31:42.041
THIS STUDENT, HONESTLY,
IS UNDER AN INCREDIBLE
AMOUNT OF PRESSURE.

31:42.041 --> 31:43.125
SHE SETS THESE
RIDICULOUS GOALS
FOR HERSELF,

31:43.125 --> 31:45.500
SHE'S NOT WILLING
TO ACCEPT HELP,

31:45.500 --> 31:46.875
SHE'S UNDER
THE FALSE IMPRESSION

31:46.875 --> 31:48.041
THAT IF SHE GETS
ONE "B,"

31:48.041 --> 31:49.417
THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE
IS GONNA FALL APART.

31:49.417 --> 31:52.458
SHE?

31:52.458 --> 31:54.000
UH, YEAH. SHE.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.208
AHH. I THINK I UNDERSTAND
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM,
MR. WITTER.

31:58.208 --> 31:59.542
OH, YOU DO.

31:59.542 --> 32:01.417
BUT I STILL
HAVE TO SAY NO.

32:01.417 --> 32:03.542
IF I BEND THE RULE
FOR ONE PERSON,

32:03.542 --> 32:05.834
I HAVE TO BEND
THE RULES FOR EVERYBODY.

32:05.834 --> 32:07.625
WELL, I HAD
TO GIVE IT A TRY.

32:12.417 --> 32:15.959
WHICH YOU DID.

32:15.959 --> 32:18.291
ADMIRABLY.

32:25.959 --> 32:28.625
NICE TOWN
YOU'VE GOT HERE.

32:28.625 --> 32:33.041
I, UH, I FIGURED
I'D COME BY AND
HANG SOME FLYERS.

32:33.041 --> 32:38.708
YOU KNOW THE GAYS.
WE'RE, UH, ALWAYS
RECRUITING.

32:38.708 --> 32:40.417
BY THE WAY, UM,

32:40.417 --> 32:43.750
YOU'RE OFFICIALLY
KICKED OUT
OF THE ALLIANCE.

32:43.750 --> 32:45.959
I'M CRUSHED.

32:45.959 --> 32:49.875
AH, I CAN TELL.

32:49.875 --> 32:52.792
LOOK, THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT ME THAT OBVIOUSLY
INTIMIDATES YOU.

32:52.792 --> 32:54.750
IT'S NOT MY FAULT,

32:54.750 --> 32:56.125
AND I'M NOT GONNA
LET YOU PUSH ME AROUND

32:56.125 --> 32:59.625
ANY MORE THAN
I SHOULD HAVE LET
THOSE DAMN SOCCER PARENTS.

32:59.625 --> 33:02.291
FINALLY, SOMETHING
WE AGREE ON.

33:02.291 --> 33:06.750
LOOK, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DON'T KNOW YOU.

33:06.750 --> 33:09.750
AND I CAN'T POSSIBLY
UNDERSTAND YOUR LIFE.

33:09.750 --> 33:10.959
A-AND IF I JUMP
TO CONCLUSIONS

33:10.959 --> 33:13.291
BASED ON APPEARANCES,
IT'S JUST BECAUSE--

33:13.291 --> 33:16.291
WELL, THAT'S THE WAY
I'VE BEEN TREATED
MY ENTIRE LIFE.

33:16.291 --> 33:19.667
HEY, WHEN I WAS 9 I USED
TO WALK HOME THROUGH
THIS BASEBALL FIELD.

33:19.667 --> 33:21.792
ALL THESE OLDER KIDS
WOULD HIDE
IN THE DUGOUTS

33:21.792 --> 33:23.333
AND WAIT FOR ME
TO WALK BY.

33:23.333 --> 33:25.750
THEY'D CALL ME
FAG, SISSY, QUEER.
THE FULL SPECTRUM.

33:25.750 --> 33:30.917
TILL MY OLDER SISTER
WOULD COME ALONG
AND SCARE 'EM AWAY.

33:30.917 --> 33:32.667
THAT'S WHEN
YOU REALLY KNOW
YOU'RE GAY,

33:32.667 --> 33:35.000
WHEN YOUR SISTER
HAS TO FIGHT YOUR
BATTLES FOR YOU.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.291
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT'S LIKE,
DO YOU?

33:37.291 --> 33:41.750
NO, I DON'T.

33:41.750 --> 33:44.375
BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME
ANY MORE STRAIGHT.

33:52.250 --> 33:54.625
Mr. Kasdan: A MORE
PRUDENT APPROACH...

33:54.625 --> 33:57.875
WOULD BE TO HAVE
READ THE BOOK
BEFORE THE TEST.

33:57.875 --> 34:00.500
I BLEW IT, DIDN'T I?

34:00.500 --> 34:02.417
C-MINUS.

34:02.417 --> 34:05.708
CERTAINLY NOT
YOUR FINEST HOUR.

34:05.708 --> 34:08.458
BUT THEN I'M GUESSING
YOU ALREADY KNEW THAT,

34:08.458 --> 34:12.208
CONSIDERING THE LITTLE
VISIT I HAD THIS MORNING
FROM YOUR--

34:12.208 --> 34:16.125
I HESITATE TO USE
THE TERM "BETTER HALF."

34:16.125 --> 34:17.500
PACEY?

34:17.500 --> 34:18.875
HE ASKED ME TO GIVE YOU
A SECOND CHANCE.

34:18.875 --> 34:22.583
I SAID NO, OF COURSE.

34:22.583 --> 34:28.208
HOWEVER, IAN PRANGE
WAS AT THE ORTHODONTIST
AGAIN,

34:28.208 --> 34:31.333
SO I'M GIVING
A MAKE-UP TOMORROW,

34:31.333 --> 34:34.958
AND IF
YOU'D BE INTERESTED
IN RETAKING THE TEST,

34:34.958 --> 34:36.375
YOU COULD DO THAT.

34:36.375 --> 34:37.708
I--I--UH--PLEASE.

34:37.708 --> 34:39.333
I MEAN, I WOULD
REALLY APPRECIATE--

34:39.333 --> 34:41.708
DON'T THANK ME YET.

34:41.708 --> 34:44.000
I'M PLANNING TO PENALIZE
YOU HALF A LETTER GRADE.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.583
OK.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.208
AND, BY THE WAY,

34:47.208 --> 34:50.291
YOU'RE DOING
SOME SERIOUS DAMAGE
WITH THIS HIGHLIGHTER.

35:01.083 --> 35:05.917
"NEAR THE END OF MARCH 1845,
I BORROWED AN AXE

35:05.917 --> 35:10.208
AND WENT DOWN TO THE WOODS
BY WALDEN POND, NEAREST
TO WHERE I--"

35:10.208 --> 35:14.041
WHAT'S THE MOST
IMPORTANT WORD
IN THAT SENTENCE?

35:16.875 --> 35:18.208
WOODS?

35:18.208 --> 35:20.208
BORROWED.

35:20.208 --> 35:21.667
THE IMPORTANT THING

35:21.667 --> 35:25.417
TO REMEMBER ABOUT
THE TRANSCENDENTALISTS

35:25.417 --> 35:28.000
IS THAT WHILE
SELF-RELIANCE IS
A MOST ADMIRABLE TRAIT,

35:28.000 --> 35:33.917
THOREAU WASN'T REALLY
ALL THAT ALONE OUT THERE
BY WALDEN POND.

35:33.917 --> 35:37.333
HE HAD NEIGHBORS,
FRIENDS,

35:37.333 --> 35:41.041
PEOPLE HE COULD RELY ON.

35:41.041 --> 35:44.083
WE SHOULD ALL
BE SO LUCKY.

35:48.959 --> 35:52.708
MR. BROOKS?

35:56.458 --> 36:00.125
OH, UH, I'M SORRY.
I CAN COME BACK LATER.
I JUST--

36:00.125 --> 36:02.750
I KNOW. HE TOLD ME.

36:02.750 --> 36:04.208
SEE, YOU'VE
BEEN REALLY
TIRING HIM OUT

36:04.208 --> 36:06.750
WITH THAT VIDEO
OF YOURS.

36:06.750 --> 36:08.542
OH, NOT INTENTIONALLY.

36:08.542 --> 36:10.166
NO, I THINK THAT
YOU ARE THE REASON

36:10.166 --> 36:11.625
THAT HE'S NOT TAKING
HIS MEDICATION.

36:11.625 --> 36:13.708
HE SAYS IT'S
BECAUSE IT MAKES HIM
FORGET THINGS,

36:13.708 --> 36:17.166
AND I SAID, "WELL,
FORGETTING CAN BE
A GOOD THING,"

36:17.166 --> 36:18.583
AND THEN HE SAID,

36:18.583 --> 36:20.583
"BUT NOT WHEN
YOU'RE MAKING
A DOCUMENTARY."

36:20.583 --> 36:22.333
LOUISE HERE
HAS A BIG MOUTH.

36:22.333 --> 36:23.500
LOVES TO CHAT
WITH NOSY TEENAGERS.

36:23.500 --> 36:27.083
YOU'D THINK I WAS
PAYING HER TO TALK.

36:27.083 --> 36:29.333
NURSES CAN BE
REPLACED, YOU KNOW.

36:29.333 --> 36:33.583
I KNOW. I WILL
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

36:39.708 --> 36:42.041
Mr. Brooks: ALL RIGHT,
THE SECRET'S OUT.

36:42.041 --> 36:43.875
NOT TO WORRY,
I'M NOT DEAD YET.

36:43.875 --> 36:45.166
I'M JUST HOLDING SHORT
WAITING FOR A CLEARANCE.

36:45.166 --> 36:47.792
SO WHAT CAN I
HELP YOU WITH?

36:47.792 --> 36:51.291
I, UH, LEFT
MY VIDEO CAMERA
HERE YESTERDAY.

36:51.291 --> 36:54.333
OH, SORRY.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

36:54.333 --> 36:56.000
THERE IT IS.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.875
SEE? I DIDN'T STEAL
IT OR ANYTHING.

36:59.875 --> 37:04.583
PROBABLY BEYOND ME,
MAJOR MOTION PICTURE
DIRECTOR THAT I AM,

37:04.583 --> 37:07.375
TO FIGURE OUT HOW
THE DAMN THING
WORKS, ANYWAY.

37:07.375 --> 37:10.208
[CHUCKLES]
HEY, HEY,
WAIT A MINUTE.

37:10.208 --> 37:11.458
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

37:11.458 --> 37:14.041
YOU CAN'T ABANDON
THE A.I. BROOKS STORY,

37:14.041 --> 37:15.834
EPIC MOTION PICTURE
IN PROGRESS.

37:15.834 --> 37:17.583
W-WELL, THE NURSE
SAID THAT, UH--

37:17.583 --> 37:18.708
LOOK, I'M NOT GONNA
BE AROUND FOREVER.

37:18.708 --> 37:21.208
MIGHT BE NICE TO LEAVE
SOMETHING BEHIND,

37:21.208 --> 37:23.959
YOU KNOW, FOR PEOPLE
TO REMEMBER ME BY.

37:23.959 --> 37:28.208
SINCE THE A&E BIOGRAPHY
FOLKS AREN'T GONNA GET
TO ME ANY TIME SOON,

37:28.208 --> 37:30.125
WOULD YOU
STILL BE WILLING

37:30.125 --> 37:32.708
TO DIRECT THIS
LITTLE PICTURE OF OURS?

37:32.708 --> 37:33.375
SURE.

37:33.375 --> 37:36.166
ALL RIGHTY THEN.

37:38.792 --> 37:43.458
SO, UH, WHERE DO YOU
WANT TO START?

37:43.458 --> 37:46.917
WHEN I WAS HITCHHIKING
TO THE WEST COAST,

37:46.917 --> 37:48.667
I TRIED TO STAY
ON ROUTE 66, YOU KNOW,

37:48.667 --> 37:51.583
BUT I HAD
TO TAKE SUCH RIDES
AS I COULD GET,

37:51.583 --> 37:54.959
AND SO SOMEHOW I
ENDED UP IN LAS VEGAS,

37:54.959 --> 37:57.750
STRANDED
AT A LITTLE DINER.

37:57.750 --> 37:59.583
THAT'S WHERE I MET HER.

37:59.583 --> 38:02.291
THE GIRL FROM YOUR MOVIE.

38:02.291 --> 38:09.625
ELLIE ANDREWS, WAITRESS.
BORN AND RAISED IN VEGAS
AND HATED IT.

38:09.625 --> 38:10.708
SAID SHE COULDN'T
UNDERSTAND

38:10.708 --> 38:12.250
WHY PEOPLE WOULD
GO OUT IN THE DESERT

38:12.250 --> 38:16.208
TO TAKE CHANCES
THEY'D BE TOO AFRAID
TO TAKE AT HOME.

38:16.208 --> 38:22.458
SAID SHE'D RATHER
GAMBLE ON LIFE THAN
ON THE ROLL OF THE DICE.

38:22.458 --> 38:25.208
ONE DAY A RIDE CAME BY,
TOWARD L.A.,

38:25.208 --> 38:27.792
AND, UH, BEFORE I COULD
SAY GOOD-BYE TO HER,

38:27.792 --> 38:33.583
SHE JUMPED
OVER THE COUNTER
AND CAME WITH ME.

38:33.583 --> 38:35.458
JUST LIKE THAT?

38:35.458 --> 38:41.458
ALL THE WAY
TO SUNSET AND VINE.

38:41.458 --> 38:44.458
GOD, I MISS HER.

38:44.458 --> 38:48.583
A GOOD WOMAN.
YOU'D HAVE LIKED HER.

38:48.583 --> 38:51.625
I MISS HER.

38:58.417 --> 38:59.667
YOU RANG?

38:59.667 --> 39:01.083
I THOUGHT I'D
CALL MY BOYFRIEND

39:01.083 --> 39:03.875
'CAUSE I NEED
A LITTLE HELP
WITH SOMETHING.

39:03.875 --> 39:06.000
WHERE'S ALEXANDER?

39:06.000 --> 39:07.667
WATCHING A VIDEO
IN BESSIE'S ROOM.

39:07.667 --> 39:11.083
OK, NOW I'M STARTING
TO GET SUSPICIOUS.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

39:11.083 --> 39:13.458
I WANTED
TO SAY THANK YOU.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.583
FOR WHAT?

39:17.583 --> 39:20.583
THE TEST.

39:20.583 --> 39:23.500
YOU GOT MR. KASDAN
TO LET ME RETAKE THE TEST.

39:23.500 --> 39:25.333
I DID?

39:25.333 --> 39:28.417
I MEAN, I KNOW THAT
I DID, BUT I DIDN'T
KNOW THAT IT WORKED.

39:28.417 --> 39:29.750
THIS IS GREAT.
SO, HOW'D YOU DO?

39:29.750 --> 39:34.708
OH, I GO TAKE IT TOMORROW
AFTER SCHOOL, SO, UM...

39:34.708 --> 39:37.333
TONIGHT...

39:37.333 --> 39:40.125
UH...

39:40.125 --> 39:41.917
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

39:41.917 --> 39:43.583
WELL, YOU TELL ME.

39:45.834 --> 39:47.750
I DID WHAT YOU ASKED.

39:47.750 --> 39:52.375
ALL GHOSTS
LOCKED FIRMLY AWAY.

39:52.375 --> 39:58.000
EXCEPT FOR THE GHOST
OF CHRISTMAS FUTURE.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.000
AND THERE'S
REALLY NO REASON...

40:00.000 --> 40:03.375
WELL, THERE IS
SOMETHING ELSE

40:03.375 --> 40:06.041
WE PROBABLY
SHOULD BE DOING.

40:06.041 --> 40:07.208
"TRUST THYSELF."

40:07.208 --> 40:08.500
EMERSON.

40:08.500 --> 40:09.959
WHAT
TRANSCENDENTALIST
MAGAZINE

40:09.959 --> 40:11.708
WAS EDITED BY BOTH
EMERSON AND THOREAU?

40:11.708 --> 40:13.375
THE DIAL.

40:13.375 --> 40:15.166
TRANSCENDENTALISM
TOOK ITS NAME FROM
KANT'S CRITIQUE OF...

40:15.166 --> 40:17.542
PURE REASON.

40:17.542 --> 40:18.917
WRONG.
PRACTICAL REASON.

40:18.917 --> 40:21.250
OH.

40:21.250 --> 40:23.166
PRACTICAL REASON.

40:23.166 --> 40:26.750
UH, WHERE WAS
BROOK FARM?

40:26.750 --> 40:29.875
WEST ROXBURY,
MASSACHUSETTS.

40:31.583 --> 40:32.792
DAWSON!

40:32.792 --> 40:35.041
JUST IN TIME.
YOU DIDN'T MISS
ANYTHING YET.

40:35.041 --> 40:37.542
THEY GOT A GOOD ONE
THIS YEAR, DON'T
YOU THINK?

40:37.542 --> 40:40.125
UH, YEAH.

40:40.125 --> 40:42.583
YEAH.

40:42.583 --> 40:44.500
ACTUALLY, I DIDN'T COME
FOR THE CEREMONY.

40:44.500 --> 40:46.208
UH, I CAME
TO TALK TO YOU.

40:46.208 --> 40:50.750
OH. OH, WELL, JUST
DON'T TELL YOUR MOM
THAT I'M OUT HERE.

40:50.750 --> 40:53.667
SHE THINKS
I'M DOING INVENTORY
IN THE STOCKROOM.

40:53.667 --> 40:55.500
OK.

40:55.500 --> 40:59.792
UM, DO YOU LIKE
TO GAMBLE?

40:59.792 --> 41:03.250
UM, ARE WE TALKING
BINGO OR MORE
SERIOUS STUFF?

41:03.250 --> 41:06.083
UH, ANYTHING.
'CAUSE I--I DON'T.

41:06.083 --> 41:07.750
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD
WHY ANYBODY DID IT.

41:07.750 --> 41:10.166
UH, HEH, UNTIL TODAY.

41:10.166 --> 41:13.333
IF THIS HAS
TO DO WITH WHAT HAPPENED
THE OTHER DAY,

41:13.333 --> 41:14.959
I THINK I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA SAY AND--

41:14.959 --> 41:16.750
I LIKE YOU.

41:16.750 --> 41:19.041
THERE. I SAID IT.

41:19.041 --> 41:21.291
I LIKE YOU AND...

41:23.875 --> 41:27.125
THAT KISS MEANT MORE TO ME
THAN JUST HAPPY HOLIDAYS.

41:27.125 --> 41:29.041
AND EVERYTHING I SAID
THE OTHER DAY WAS A LIE.

41:29.041 --> 41:31.625
WELL, NOT A LIE,
BECAUSE I THINK
I MEANT IT AT THE TIME,

41:31.625 --> 41:34.208
BUT I WAS BASICALLY
JUST TRYING TO FOOL MYSELF

41:34.208 --> 41:37.291
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
TO SCREW UP OUR FRIENDSHIP,

41:37.291 --> 41:39.000
AND I WAS GONNA
LET THAT FEAR STOP ME.

41:39.000 --> 41:41.166
BUT I DON'T WANT TO,
AND I'M NOT GOING TO,

41:41.166 --> 41:44.125
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO LEARN THAT LESSON AT 17

41:44.125 --> 41:46.583
OR AT ANY TIME,
FOR THAT MATTER.

41:46.583 --> 41:48.208
AND YOU CAN TELL ME
THAT YOU'RE TOO OLD,

41:48.208 --> 41:49.667
AND YOU CAN TELL ME
THAT I'M TOO YOUNG,

41:49.667 --> 41:52.000
AND YOU CAN TELL ME
THAT I'M NOT OVER JOEY,

41:52.000 --> 41:54.667
BUT NOTHING YOU CAN SAY
IS GONNA CHANGE THE FACT
THAT I SAID IT.

41:54.667 --> 41:56.500
AND I'M REALLY GLAD
THAT I SAID IT

41:56.500 --> 42:00.166
BECAUSE YOU'RE WORTH
RISKING EVERYTHING FOR.

42:02.834 --> 42:04.667
WHAT AM I GONNA
DO WITH YOU?

42:04.667 --> 42:07.166
JUST TELL ME THE TRUTH.

42:07.166 --> 42:09.667
THE TRUTH.

42:09.667 --> 42:12.542
SOMETIMES A KISS
IS JUST A KISS,

42:12.542 --> 42:14.625
AND SOMETIMES
A KISS MEANS...

42:22.333 --> 42:25.500
HAPPY HOLIDAYS.

42:27.041 --> 42:29.458
HAPPY HOLIDAYS.
