39:20.520 --> 39:22.841
We did the science, you're...

39:22.920 --> 39:24.604
You're my family.

39:24.680 --> 39:27.684
You would say anything
to get your sister back.

39:27.760 --> 39:30.001
Think about it, CASTOR and LEDA,

39:30.120 --> 39:33.886
two donors, two originals, siblings!

39:38.200 --> 39:41.090
You are not my family.

39:41.160 --> 39:43.003
Now, I need to go find Gracie.

40:21.280 --> 40:23.009
Mrs Johanssen, please.

40:24.520 --> 40:26.921
We shared everything with you, Mark.

40:28.800 --> 40:31.485
- Our home, our hearts.

40:32.080 --> 40:33.241
Our daughter.

40:33.520 --> 40:36.171
Now you'll answer to us.

40:36.840 --> 40:38.649
(STAMMERS) Please.

(MARK SHUDDERING)

40:41.360 --> 40:42.691
I love her.

40:44.400 --> 40:46.084
Not like her mother.

40:59.280 --> 41:00.566
- (GRUNTS)
- Guards!

41:00.640 --> 41:01.880
You're a shit mother!

41:01.960 --> 41:04.247
- There was a car following me.
- Was it Marci Coates?

41:04.320 --> 41:05.367
MAN: My boss wants a meeting.

41:05.440 --> 41:06.965
- Whoa, mister, that my wife!
- Shut up.

41:07.040 --> 41:08.929
I'm not gonna let an app
decide who I love.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.525
Nobody meets anyone
in person any more, darling.

41:10.600 --> 41:11.647
- I'm not. No.
- Why not?

41:12.040 --> 41:14.361
- (GASPS SOFTLY)
- There you are, Mommy.
