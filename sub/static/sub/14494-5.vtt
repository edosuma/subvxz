04:43.017 --> 04:46.429
Because you're emitting

05:23.715 --> 05:25.246
You see,
what I'm afraid of

is that SHIELD isn't trying
to cure these people.

05:28.785 --> 05:31.556
I'm afraid they're trying
to turn them into weapons.

05:34.926 --> 05:36.084

Who's she talking to?

19:47.355 --> 19:49.884
<i>Good work, Widow.
Hydra is pleased.</i>

19:49.914 --> 19:51.047
[gasps]

20:41.437 --> 20:42.954
[both gasp]

20:42.984 --> 20:44.974
Why'd you do it? Why?

20:45.004 --> 20:47.066
We've been partners
for years.

20:47.963 --> 20:49.913
Tell me the truth.

20:50.190 --> 20:52.240
You owe it to me, Natasha.

20:53.485 --> 20:56.661
The real question is,
why did you do it?

20:56.691 --> 20:59.278
Why did you betray
SHIELD to Hydra?

20:59.313 --> 21:02.515
Was it the power, Clint,
or just the money?

21:02.801 --> 21:04.444
What are you talking about?

21:04.474 --> 21:06.219
The Banner samples
are worth millions

21:06.249 --> 21:09.339
to the right people,
but you know that.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.759
Natasha, what's going on?

21:16.412 --> 21:18.564
[Men grunt]

21:19.431 --> 21:21.934
I will miss working
with you, Clint.

21:27.821 --> 21:30.910
Hawkeye is
a double agent for Hydra.
Take him down.

21:30.940 --> 21:32.990
What? I'm not
the double agent.

21:39.051 --> 21:40.184
[grunts]

21:58.704 --> 22:00.503
Aah!

22:05.092 --> 22:07.370
Take him to the Vault.
Put him in solitary.

22:07.373 --> 22:09.057
No one sees him
until I give the word.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.122
I'll take care
of the Hydra agents.

22:18.694 --> 22:21.800
It worked. We'll need
to arrange a new drop.

22:22.092 --> 22:23.873
But as far
as SHIELD is concerned,

22:24.160 --> 22:27.129
I just took down
a traitorous double agent.

22:27.970 --> 22:30.184
Hail, Hydra.

22:31.305 --> 22:37.588
