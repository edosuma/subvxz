Yo, Miguel,

01:37.997 --> 01:39.332
Save some
for the tournament.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.168
( exhales sharply )

01:42.201 --> 01:44.136
Hey, don't even bother.

01:44.169 --> 01:46.439
He's been super aggro
ever since the breakup.

01:47.307 --> 01:48.341
( exhales sharply )

01:48.374 --> 01:49.776
Well, where's sensei?

01:49.809 --> 01:51.311
The tournament's
gonna start soon.

01:51.344 --> 01:53.346
- Aisha: He'll be here.
- I don't know about that.

01:54.113 --> 01:55.748
What are you
talking about?

01:55.781 --> 01:58.017
I saw him last night
at the mini mall.
I was buying...

01:58.051 --> 01:59.619
(stammers) A carton of milk.

02:00.186 --> 02:01.954

Now who's pissed?

02:10.830 --> 02:13.166
Uh, Sensei?

02:14.300 --> 02:15.734
Everything all right?

02:15.768 --> 02:17.737
We're all gonna die, kid!

02:17.770 --> 02:20.473
- We're all gonna die!
- ( glass shatters )

02:21.674 --> 02:23.643
Well, why didn't you
tell us this earlier?

02:23.676 --> 02:26.112
I don't know.
I guess I'm just so used
to seeing him drunk,

02:26.145 --> 02:27.246
it didn't seem like
that big a deal.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.347
Well, we're here,
and he's not.

02:28.380 --> 02:29.849
So it's officially
a big deal.

02:29.882 --> 02:31.050
What if something happened
to him?

02:31.083 --> 02:32.352
- Like what?
- I don't know.

02:32.385 --> 02:33.719
Like he drove his car
off a cliff,

02:33.752 --> 02:35.388
or he bought a gun
and blew his brains out.

02:35.421 --> 02:36.689
<i>Aisha: No, sensei would never
kill himself.</i>

02:36.723 --> 02:38.324
It's too pussy a move.

02:38.357 --> 02:39.992
Whatever.
I mean, we're here.

02:40.026 --> 02:41.460
We're gonna have to do it
without him.

02:41.493 --> 02:42.829
<i> Johnny: Do what without me?</i>

02:42.862 --> 02:44.497
Sensei.

02:44.530 --> 02:46.599
We didn't think
you were gonna show up.

02:46.632 --> 02:49.001
I may not always win, but
I never back out of a fight.

02:49.035 --> 02:50.069
<i> Miguel: Great.</i>

02:50.103 --> 02:51.704
Let's sign up.

02:51.738 --> 02:52.772
<i>Johnny: Not yet.</i>

02:54.774 --> 02:57.709
There's one more lesson
I have to teach you.

02:57.743 --> 03:01.281
<i>Man: ( over PA )
All teams report to the locker
room in five minutes.</i>

03:01.314 --> 03:03.950
You've all learned
to strike first,

03:03.983 --> 03:05.918
to be aggressive,

03:05.952 --> 03:08.187
not be losers.

03:08.221 --> 03:10.423
I've taught you
to strike hard,

03:10.456 --> 03:14.194
put every ounce of your power
behind everything you do.

03:16.496 --> 03:19.365
But I haven't taught you
the third rule of Cobra Kai...

03:21.567 --> 03:23.069
No mercy.

03:23.102 --> 03:25.138
<i>The older you get,
the more you're gonna learn</i>

03:25.171 --> 03:27.273
that life isn't fair.

03:28.174 --> 03:30.677
You wake up one morning
feeling great,

03:30.710 --> 03:33.413
and then life throws a spinning
heel kick to your balls.

03:33.446 --> 03:35.481
Takes a big steaming shit
in your mouth.

03:36.381 --> 03:38.084
You get an F on a test.

03:38.117 --> 03:39.985
You get suspended.

03:40.019 --> 03:41.787
You fall in love
with a girl,

03:41.820 --> 03:44.490
and some other dude comes
and steals her away.

03:44.524 --> 03:46.559
Your car gets set on fire.

03:46.593 --> 03:50.129
Just when you think
things are going good,
everything falls apart.

03:50.163 --> 03:51.798
That's how it goes.

03:52.965 --> 03:54.867
Life shows no mercy,

03:54.900 --> 03:57.336
so neither do we.

03:57.370 --> 03:59.838
We do whatever it takes
to keep our heads above water.

03:59.872 --> 04:02.574
We do whatever it takes
to keep moving forward.

04:02.608 --> 04:04.577
We do whatever it takes
to win!

04:05.812 --> 04:07.813
Remember who you are.

04:07.847 --> 04:09.549
You're badass.

04:10.316 --> 04:11.918
You don't give a shit.

04:12.885 --> 04:14.354
You kick ass.

04:16.989 --> 04:18.524
You're Cobra Kai.

04:18.558 --> 04:20.593
Cobra Kai!

04:20.627 --> 04:21.727
( all scream )

04:21.760 --> 04:23.262
All right, guys,
let's get down there

04:23.295 --> 04:24.864
and kick the shit out
of everybody.

04:24.897 --> 04:26.432
( together ) Yeah!

04:28.100 --> 04:29.335
No.

04:30.536 --> 04:32.104
You're not wearing those.

04:32.137 --> 04:34.573
<i> Man: ( on TV )
Well, it's a good thing
today is Sunday</i>

04:34.607 --> 04:38.277
<i> because it is gonna be sunny
outside here in LA...</i>

04:38.311 --> 04:39.979
<i> (continues indistinctly)</i>

04:41.347 --> 04:44.717
So is this the plan
for the whole day?

04:44.750 --> 04:46.352
<i> 'Cause I was thinking maybe
we could swing by</i>

04:46.385 --> 04:48.187
<i> the DMV or maybe a funeral.</i>

04:48.220 --> 04:49.689
<i> You know, put a little pep
in our step.</i>

04:50.789 --> 04:52.725
Come on, guys.

04:52.758 --> 04:56.062
So your boyfriend
turned out
to be a jerk.

04:56.095 --> 04:59.499
And your boyfriend
turned out to be the son
of your mortal enemy.

04:59.532 --> 05:02.669
<i>You can't expect me to go
to this tournament
all by myself.</i>

05:02.702 --> 05:05.204
You know
how creeped out I get
by karate moms.

05:05.237 --> 05:06.705
Nobody's making you go.

05:06.738 --> 05:09.007
LaRusso Auto Group
is one of the main sponsors.

05:09.041 --> 05:11.410
<i>One of us has
to be there.</i>

05:11.444 --> 05:14.180
<i>You know what?
Fine. Fine.</i>

05:14.213 --> 05:17.283
I'm gonna be looking at boots
on Zappos if anybody needs me.

05:17.316 --> 05:19.085
<i> Man: ( on TV
speaking indistinctly)</i>

05:23.455 --> 05:25.158
I'll go if you want to go.

05:25.191 --> 05:26.892
- I didn't say anything.
- Sam: I know.

05:26.926 --> 05:28.995
I just know it's your thing.

05:29.028 --> 05:30.997
( scoffs )
Not this year.

05:33.332 --> 05:35.568
Everyone I know
is gonna be there.

05:37.102 --> 05:39.071
It is the 50th anniversary.

05:47.780 --> 05:50.650
<i> The competition
will begin shortly.</i>

05:52.118 --> 05:53.186
Great turnout.

05:53.219 --> 05:54.286
I'm telling you,

05:54.320 --> 05:56.155
it's all about
the blue mats.

05:56.189 --> 05:59.791
Yeah, I'm sure word
really got around.

05:59.825 --> 06:02.228
We don't have to stay long.
We'll just check out
a few matches,

06:02.261 --> 06:03.796
and we'll hit the road,
all right?

06:03.829 --> 06:05.598
<i> - George: There he is.</i>
- ( chuckles )

06:05.631 --> 06:08.935
Hey, everyone,
it's the former
champion in the flesh.

06:08.968 --> 06:10.169
Good to see you, champ.

06:10.202 --> 06:12.204
Are you sure
you don't want me
to keep the car running?

06:12.237 --> 06:13.539
Go ahead.

06:13.572 --> 06:15.374
How are ya?

This has been going on

From Granada Hills,

Oh, hi, Patricia.
You really went all out
this year, huh?

07:20.906 --> 07:22.575
Well, you know,
I want to support my baby.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.277
You know how it goes.

07:24.310 --> 07:26.145
Fighting out of Topanga,

<i> - Daryl: All right, folks.</i>

09:02.074 --> 09:03.008
That's one point, Diaz.

- Sorry.

11:36.428 --> 11:38.064
Eat shit, asshole.

11:38.663 --> 11:40.933
It was a good fight.

11:40.966 --> 11:43.002
- You'll get him next time.
- Whatever.

11:45.003 --> 11:47.006
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

11:49.108 --> 11:50.208
<i> Daryl: Yes!</i>

11:50.242 --> 11:53.278
Let's give it up
for all of our competitors.

You're all winners.

11:55.748 --> 12:00.719
<i> We have seen some great
fighting today, haven't we?
Huh?</i>

12:00.752 --> 12:02.788
You did a great job
out there.

12:05.424 --> 12:06.992
You know,
if he hadn't resorted
to that sweep,

12:07.026 --> 12:08.427
you totally
would have had him.

12:08.460 --> 12:10.496
I don't need your sympathy.

12:12.031 --> 12:15.000
<i> Daryl: There can be only one
true winner,</i>

12:15.034 --> 12:18.704
and he is standing
on this stage right now.

12:18.737 --> 12:21.574
Will it be Miguel Diaz

12:21.607 --> 12:23.075
from Cobra Kai Karate?

12:23.108 --> 12:24.810
Whoo!

12:24.843 --> 12:27.880
Will it be Hawk...

12:27.913 --> 12:29.582
well, I guess it's just Hawk

12:29.615 --> 12:31.717
from Cobra Kai Karate?

12:31.750 --> 12:33.585
<i> - Daryl: Huh?</i>
- Moskowitz.

12:33.619 --> 12:35.788
It's Eli Moskowitz.

12:35.821 --> 12:37.622
Will it be Robby Keene,

12:37.656 --> 12:38.857
unaffiliated?

12:38.890 --> 12:41.127
( scattered applause )

12:42.695 --> 12:45.898
And last
but certainly not least,

12:45.931 --> 12:50.135
last year's champion,
fighting out
of Topanga Karate,

12:50.169 --> 12:52.371
Xander Stone!

( cheers and applause )

12:54.906 --> 12:56.175

12:56.208 --> 12:58.343
I love you, Xander!
You're my boy.

12:58.376 --> 13:01.280
I just wanted to say,
even though I love to fight,

13:01.313 --> 13:04.150
we all need to fight together
against hatred.

13:04.749 --> 13:05.784
( sighs )

13:05.817 --> 13:07.218
Look, I know
this is probably

13:07.252 --> 13:10.022
the last thing
you want to hear
right now.

13:10.055 --> 13:11.924
But I'm really sorry.

13:12.891 --> 13:14.259
You're my oldest friend,

13:14.292 --> 13:15.961
and I never should have been
hanging out

13:15.994 --> 13:18.230
with somebody like Yasmine
in the first place.

13:18.264 --> 13:19.799
You got that right.

13:22.201 --> 13:24.970
All I know is,
after that front wedgie,

13:25.003 --> 13:27.606
she's never gonna
live that down.

13:27.639 --> 13:30.642
- You saw that?
- It's all over YouTube.

13:30.676 --> 13:32.678
You really tore her a new...

13:32.711 --> 13:33.745
vagina?

13:33.778 --> 13:36.248
( both laughing )

13:37.950 --> 13:40.718
You know, I got to admit,
this is a pretty cool gi.

13:40.752 --> 13:41.887
Thank you.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.322
I mean, the snake's a little
on the evil side,

13:43.355 --> 13:46.424
- but I like the colors.
- ( chuckles )

13:46.458 --> 13:48.227
- I can probably get you one.
- Yeah, right.

13:48.260 --> 13:51.296
My dad would have
a heart attack.

13:51.329 --> 13:54.065
Well, even if you
don't join Cobra Kai,

13:54.099 --> 13:56.869
we could definitely use
another girl out there.

13:58.971 --> 14:01.206
<i> Xander: And as I look around

14:01.239 --> 14:03.709
<i> I pray for every race,

that we can all
live together in peace.

14:06.778 --> 14:09.181
Please join me
in a moment of silence

14:09.214 --> 14:12.184

intolerance in our time.

in the face.

He's a kid,
