00:15.140 --> 00:18.268
<i>For Terry, every day</i>
<i>means a new murder case,</i>

00:18.852 --> 00:21.771
<i>and a new celebrity guest star</i>
<i>as his partner.</i>

00:22.272 --> 00:26.484
<i>Today's guest:</i>
<i>Emmy-winning actress Annie Murphy.</i>

00:26.985 --> 00:28.653
<i>But here's the catch.</i>

00:28.737 --> 00:30.822
<i>Annie isn't being given a script.</i>

00:30.905 --> 00:33.825
<i>She has no idea what's about to happen.</i>

00:34.325 --> 00:38.872
<i>Together, she and Terry will have</i>
<i>to improvise their way through the case.</i>

00:38.955 --> 00:42.083
<i>But it'll be up to Annie alone</i>
<i>to name the killer.</i>

00:42.834 --> 00:46.087
<i>So join them</i>
<i>as they punch a one-way ticket</i>

00:46.921 --> 00:48.631
<i>to Murderville.</i>

00:56.264 --> 00:58.099
<i>Another day of solving murders</i>

00:58.183 --> 01:00.977
<i>and dropping hints to my wife</i>
<i>that I wanted her back.</i>

01:01.061 --> 01:04.355
<i>Or as we like to call it</i>
<i>in the murder business, Thursday.</i>

01:04.439 --> 01:07.525
Well, well, well. Free donuts.

01:07.609 --> 01:10.695
Looks like everyone's favorite
senior detective brought free donuts.

01:10.779 --> 01:11.613
That's right.

01:11.696 --> 01:15.241
He's got disposable income
and he's spending it on you.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.035
Unless you want to chip in
because they weren't cheap.

01:17.118 --> 01:19.079
- Thanks, man. I'll have one.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.206
That's mine.

01:22.373 --> 01:24.667
- Which one?
- Which one were you reaching for?

01:24.751 --> 01:26.169
- That one.
- Yeah, that's mine.

01:26.795 --> 01:31.424
Plus I don't like when guys come in
and try to take other guys' donuts.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.009
Maybe it's not your donut to control.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.012
Maybe if you'd been nicer
to that donut,

01:36.513 --> 01:38.097
someone else wouldn't be trying to eat it.

01:38.181 --> 01:41.226
Well, maybe that donut
doesn't understand my love language

01:41.726 --> 01:44.395
and maybe that donut and I
were trying to work on it in therapy.

01:44.479 --> 01:46.523
Well, maybe the donut
just got tired of waiting for you

01:46.606 --> 01:49.484
to figure your shit out and decided
she's ready to be with a real man.

01:49.567 --> 01:50.485
What?

01:55.031 --> 01:56.366
Come on. What?

01:57.700 --> 01:58.827
What is going on?

01:58.910 --> 02:01.454
He started a trash fire.

02:01.538 --> 02:02.997
And I put it out.

02:03.581 --> 02:06.251
Good thing I was here. Thank God.

02:06.334 --> 02:09.170
- Want half my chocolate donut, Chief?
- Thank you.

02:09.254 --> 02:10.672
Anytime.

02:14.342 --> 02:15.009
Okay.

02:15.510 --> 02:18.638
FYI, that donut was a metaphor for you.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.641
So he just ripped you in half.

02:21.724 --> 02:23.476
Sometimes a donut
is just a donut, Terry.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.853
You follow me.

02:30.525 --> 02:33.736
Jesus, Terry, look at this place.

02:33.820 --> 02:35.989
Listen, be real with me.

02:36.072 --> 02:38.074
Is this thing with you and Daz
actually happening?

02:38.158 --> 02:40.660
Terry, it's happening and you're going
to need to just accept it.

02:40.743 --> 02:43.663
Name one thing
that makes him better than me.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.666
Well, I don't think I could pick just one.

02:46.749 --> 02:49.043
Yeah, see? There you go. Can't do it.

02:49.127 --> 02:52.922
Terry, you're going to be okay.
You're going to meet someone new.

02:53.006 --> 02:56.801
In fact, I've got someone new
for you right now. A new partner.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.511
- No, no, no Chief.
- Come on in, Annie!

02:58.595 --> 03:00.680
Chief, come on!
It's like you do this every day.

03:00.763 --> 03:02.181
What are you talking about?

03:03.224 --> 03:04.350
Hi.

03:04.976 --> 03:07.854
Terry, meet your new partner Annie Murphy.

03:07.937 --> 03:10.356
Annie,
this is senior detective Terry Seattle.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.358
Oh, old school handshake.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.985
Hi. Nice to meet you.

03:14.068 --> 03:14.861
Yeah.

03:14.944 --> 03:18.364
By the way, the senior is for importance,

03:18.448 --> 03:19.699
not in terms of age.

03:20.617 --> 03:22.452
Just, you know, I'm obviously very young

03:22.535 --> 03:24.954
which you could
probably tell by my physique. So…

03:25.038 --> 03:26.039
Yeah.

03:26.122 --> 03:27.540
This is what you're dealing with.

03:27.624 --> 03:30.627
Good luck and I apologize
in advance, okay?

03:30.710 --> 03:31.628
Have a seat.

03:31.711 --> 03:32.629
- Okay.
- Yep.

03:32.712 --> 03:33.671
Is this yours?

03:33.755 --> 03:35.548
Oh, you know what?
You can just-- yeah, that's fine.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.467
It's clean. You can hand me that.
Yeah, and it's clean.

03:38.676 --> 03:39.385
No.

03:40.803 --> 03:43.139
Put it in the trash. Not as clean as I

03:43.223 --> 03:45.642
had wanted it to be.
Yeah, grab a seat there.

03:47.810 --> 03:50.980
Okay. All right.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.149
- Annie Murphy.
- Yeah.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.734
Tell you what we're going to do
right off the bat here.

03:54.817 --> 03:57.111
Going to do ourselves a little
role-playing and see what you got.

03:57.195 --> 03:57.904
Okay.

03:57.987 --> 03:59.989
I want to see if you got what it takes
to be a homicide cop.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.076
I'm going to be
a 10-year-old girl named Susie

04:03.701 --> 04:05.912
and I'm running up to you for help. Okay?

04:05.995 --> 04:08.414
And you're a homicide detective
and I'm coming right at you

04:08.498 --> 04:10.250
and I'm a-- Detective, help me.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.168
My name's Susie, I'm 10 years old,
help me!

04:12.252 --> 04:13.503
Susie, what happened?

04:13.586 --> 04:18.258
I came home and mommy and daddy are
lying on the floor and they're not moving.

04:18.341 --> 04:21.552
And they're covered in this red stuff
and it looks like ketchup.

04:21.636 --> 04:24.681
I need you to calm down a little bit.
Okay, will you take me to where you live?

04:24.764 --> 04:25.848
It's red stuff is everywhere.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.101
- Ketchup is everywhere.
- I understand. I understand that.

04:28.184 --> 04:31.896
We own a ketchup factory and there's
ketchup everywhere. What do you think?

04:32.438 --> 04:36.192
Okay. There is--
You do own a ketchup factory?

04:36.276 --> 04:37.151
Yes.

04:37.235 --> 04:38.695
That's it. Okay, okay.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.364
- But they're covered with-- okay?
- Yeah.

04:41.447 --> 04:43.825
- Susie told you it was ketchup.
- Mhm.

04:43.908 --> 04:46.369
- Her family owns a ketchup factory.
- Yeah.

04:46.452 --> 04:49.622
What did you think initially it was when
she said there was red stuff everywhere?

04:49.706 --> 04:51.457
- Blood.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.293
Jesus Christ.

04:53.376 --> 04:54.961
That's where you're gonna go, huh?

04:55.044 --> 04:57.255
- She told you it was ketchup.
- Yeah.

04:57.338 --> 04:59.340
Right off the bat, what really happened

04:59.424 --> 05:01.592
was that their family's ketchup
machine exploded

05:01.676 --> 05:03.553
and it knocked her parents unconscious

05:03.636 --> 05:07.098
and then they died
from carbon monoxide poisoning.

05:07.181 --> 05:08.391
Yeah, I wouldn't have--

05:08.474 --> 05:11.436
And Susie didn't have
any other family to go to,

05:11.519 --> 05:14.063
so she ended up bouncing around
in the foster system,

05:14.147 --> 05:16.482
until she ran away
for a life on the street

05:17.066 --> 05:18.776
and maybe into the human slave trade.

05:21.779 --> 05:24.449
You did a great job, though. I will say
that, that's a tough one to get in.

05:24.532 --> 05:27.160
Susie with the ketchup factory
is one of our toughest.

05:27.243 --> 05:28.244
- Okay.
- My toughest.

05:28.328 --> 05:32.206
I've devised lots of role-playing
over the years to help young trainees.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.624
You know, if we're gonna be partners,

05:33.708 --> 05:36.753
we need to know
that we got each other's backs.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.463
- Yes.
- Would you ever betray me?

05:38.546 --> 05:40.465
Uh, no, I would not.

05:40.548 --> 05:43.426
I wish I could say that I had the same
confidence that I wouldn't betray you.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.219
To be honest, I'm very erratic.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.055
Well, hopefully, we'll never get to that.

05:47.138 --> 05:48.723
Are you sure that you would not betray me?

05:48.806 --> 05:52.435
- I mean, I guess only time will tell.
- Hmm.

05:52.518 --> 05:54.604
I don't want to find out
when that knife is in my back.

05:54.687 --> 05:55.897
Like, now I found out.

05:56.731 --> 05:59.484
Time told. Too late, time.

05:59.567 --> 06:00.902
Yeah. I would not.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.570
Well, we're about to find out.

06:02.653 --> 06:04.989
I'm going to tell you something
that I have never told anybody else.

06:06.616 --> 06:09.827
Ever since Chief
kicked me out of the house…

06:10.828 --> 06:12.288
and asked for a divorce,

06:12.789 --> 06:15.541
I have been living in my office.

06:18.169 --> 06:20.004
Nobody knows that.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.547
Not a single soul knows that.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.883
Nobody in this entire world knows that.

06:23.966 --> 06:26.344
- But I also like to keep it positive.
- Me too.

06:26.427 --> 06:27.970
Sorry for the interruption.

06:28.054 --> 06:31.099
No, you're not interrupting. We're having
a conversation that's finally--

06:31.182 --> 06:34.018
We're positive and we're having fun,
for Christ's sake.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.604
Did you make him cry?

06:36.687 --> 06:38.981
She did. But I'm not crying.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.901
I'm-- I'm--
I'm just overwhelmed with so much…

06:43.027 --> 06:43.986
Joy.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.155
Well, suck it up
because there's been a murder.

06:46.239 --> 06:50.910
The city's chief health inspector
keeled over in his soup, during lunch.

06:50.993 --> 06:52.370
I'm gonna need you two down there.

06:52.453 --> 06:54.122
Hey, don't screw this up.

06:54.622 --> 06:55.540
We won't.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.794
Wow. Chief health inspector.

07:00.545 --> 07:04.882
Okay. Well, are you ready
to solve a crime, Annie Murphy?

07:04.966 --> 07:05.925
I'm ready.

07:06.008 --> 07:08.594
I want to hear it, say,
"I'm ready to solve a crime."

07:08.678 --> 07:10.304
- I'm ready to solve a crime.
- Scream it!

07:10.388 --> 07:12.098
I'm ready to solve a crime!

07:12.181 --> 07:13.015
Let's go!

07:15.560 --> 07:18.354
I forget how strong I am.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.817
<i>We drove my Rampage</i>
<i>over to the crime scene at City Hall.</i>

07:22.900 --> 07:27.864
<i>It was time for Annie</i>
<i>to stare death in its soup stained face.</i>

07:29.198 --> 07:30.158
Thank you.

07:30.241 --> 07:32.452
Waiter, there's a guy in my soup.

07:33.911 --> 07:35.621
Stop it. Come on.

07:35.705 --> 07:38.666
- You supposed to make so many jokes?
- Yeah, we do this on the job.

07:38.749 --> 07:42.420
Sorry. Amber Kang, forensics.
Amber, this is my new partner

07:42.503 --> 07:43.629
Annie Murphy.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.089
You got really lucky with this one.

07:45.173 --> 07:48.050
Yeah. Guy's name is Alistair Hale.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.802
He's the chief health inspector
for the city.

07:50.511 --> 07:52.680
A real hard-ass,
I guess he made a lot of enemies.

07:52.763 --> 07:54.724
- Annie, come on over here.
- Okay.

07:55.558 --> 07:56.559
There you go, Annie.

07:56.642 --> 07:59.562
- What do you see?
- What's the dealio? What do you got?

07:59.645 --> 08:01.063
What do you think? What's your assessment?

08:01.147 --> 08:03.191
Well, it may be a heart attack?

08:03.274 --> 08:06.986
I'm gonna say he got canceled.

08:07.737 --> 08:11.699
And then just gave up his will to live.
He just got canceled.

08:11.782 --> 08:12.658
Murder by cancellation?

08:12.742 --> 08:16.162
Murder by cancellation.
Somebody found out that he peed his pants.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.706
I don't think you can get canceled
for peeing your pants.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.958
Thank God.

08:21.959 --> 08:25.004
My God. You can't get canceled
for peeing your pants.

08:25.087 --> 08:27.215
If that's a rule, then I'm good.

08:27.298 --> 08:28.841
- Okay.
- Not I'm good.

08:29.467 --> 08:32.011
- He's good.
- He's good and we're all good. Yep.

08:32.094 --> 08:34.305
- Well, it's even cooler than that.
- Okay.

08:34.388 --> 08:36.682
This man was killed…

08:38.434 --> 08:39.644
By a frog.

08:39.727 --> 08:43.105
- Specifically the golden poison frog
- Yeah, this guy.

08:43.189 --> 08:45.775
which can be found
in the remote forests of Colombia.

08:45.858 --> 08:49.153
Wow. Of all the ways
to die in Colombia, weird.

08:49.237 --> 08:52.031
Because the first one would be shot by a--

08:52.114 --> 08:55.451
a rain of bullets by a guy
on the back of a moped.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.996
- And the other would be rooty-toot-toot.
- Cocaine overdose. Yeah.

08:59.705 --> 09:01.123
- Root-a-toot-toot.
- Root-a-toot-toot.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.458
So he died…

09:02.542 --> 09:06.087
Oh, yeah. So the Chapote Indians
would harvest its natural toxin

09:06.170 --> 09:08.130
and I just found it in this guy's soup.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.049
Okay, what else?
What else can you tell us?

09:10.132 --> 09:13.302
The victim ordered
from his favorite place, City Soups,

09:13.386 --> 09:15.805
but somebody
obviously tampered with the bag.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.432
City Soup's bag is brown
with a company logo on it.

09:18.516 --> 09:19.684
That bag is white.

09:20.184 --> 09:21.143
Yeah.

09:21.811 --> 09:24.188
Right, so that's clue one. That's a clue.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.649
No one got a look at the delivery person,

09:26.732 --> 09:30.278
but the security guard does remember
hearing someone whistling.

09:30.361 --> 09:34.532
It's not easy to have a recognizable…

09:36.325 --> 09:37.243
Can you?

09:38.828 --> 09:39.787
That's good.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.290
I can do it.

09:44.458 --> 09:45.626
What note are you taking?

09:45.710 --> 09:47.169
Yeah, I think--

09:47.253 --> 09:48.337
You go high.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.006
- Okay.
- Kay, start.

09:56.095 --> 09:56.929
We should probably--

09:57.013 --> 09:59.265
Probably get to--
Yeah. Well, is this his phone?

09:59.348 --> 10:03.311
Let's open this up. We got--
No, it's a Face ID.

10:03.394 --> 10:06.105
Open up
and get his face on there to open it up.

10:06.188 --> 10:10.610
Yeah, just use his face there. Just pull
him up there and grab and let's see his--

10:11.527 --> 10:14.864
Can you-- Yep. Pull up his face.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.365
There you go. That's good.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.451
He's like your little baby.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.413
Ah… There we go. That's got it. Yep.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.834
A-ha. A threatening text
from a disgruntled chef.

10:26.917 --> 10:30.463
Alright. Well, it looks like
we got ourselves our first suspect.

10:30.546 --> 10:32.256
Anything else you want to do?
No more pictures you want to take?

10:32.340 --> 10:33.591
I think I'm pretty good for photos.

10:33.674 --> 10:34.842
I mean, he's pretty handsome.

10:34.925 --> 10:36.802
- How about you take one more?
- But I'm good. I don't-- Nope.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.262
Take one more look.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.973
He's so hand-- Look at that.

10:44.101 --> 10:46.312
Get it, Amber! Get it, get it, get it.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.982
Kay. This feels really, really wrong.

10:50.066 --> 10:54.570
<i>We headed to Chez Nanette to speak</i>
<i>with owner and head chef, Nanette DuBois.</i>

10:54.654 --> 10:58.074
<i>Alistair Hale had recently shut her down</i>
<i>for minor code violations,</i>

10:58.157 --> 11:01.243
<i>which put her at the top</i>
<i>of our menu of suspects.</i>

11:01.327 --> 11:03.287
We are not open yet.

11:03.371 --> 11:08.709
Well, you may not be open for lunch
but are you open for murder?

11:08.793 --> 11:11.420
You are murder police people?

11:11.504 --> 11:14.590
That's right. Check it.
Show her your badge.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.634
Say something cool.

11:16.717 --> 11:17.843
Look at this badge.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.179
Right, say something cooler.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.182
Check this badge out.

11:24.892 --> 11:26.227
Tell her why we're here.

11:26.310 --> 11:28.813
We have a very disturbing scene,

11:28.896 --> 11:30.773
wherein we found a man

11:30.856 --> 11:33.234
face down in a bowl of tomato soup.

11:33.317 --> 11:36.070
Yeah. Mr. Hale ring any bells?

11:36.153 --> 11:39.740
That awful little man is dead.
What a joyful day!

11:39.824 --> 11:42.451
Wow. Okay, well,
we have some questions.

11:42.535 --> 11:45.704
I am very rushed.
We are finally reopening tonight,

11:45.788 --> 11:49.041
so if you want to talk,
you must help me prep. Come, come.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.042
What do you mean?

11:50.126 --> 11:53.337
Alright, yeah.
So you prepare 30 of these

11:53.421 --> 11:57.716
with the <i>framboise</i> and the <i>crème anglaise</i>
buttercream, quick as you can. Okay?

11:57.800 --> 11:58.843
Wait, you want us to do this?

11:58.926 --> 11:59.802
Yes, okay,

11:59.885 --> 12:02.263
- so as quick as you can exactly like this.
- Yeah, we don't know shit about--

12:02.346 --> 12:04.974
- Okay. Well, great.
- Okay. <i>Allez.</i> So you have questions.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.559
Okay. Do you have any questions?

12:06.642 --> 12:08.477
- Should I lead the way?
- Don't you have some questions?

12:08.561 --> 12:10.855
I guess I do, yeah. Sorry.

12:11.730 --> 12:12.690
God, come on.

12:12.773 --> 12:15.192
Gotta keep making while you're doing it
or she's gonna kick us out of here.

12:15.276 --> 12:18.112
First question is
how did you know the victim?

12:18.195 --> 12:21.240
Ah. That little spunk weasel shut down
my restaurant the past three weeks.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.576
Cost me 150,000 in revenue,

12:23.659 --> 12:25.703
all over a missing Tupperware tub.

12:25.786 --> 12:28.706
By the way, this is what
the French don't have is speed.

12:28.789 --> 12:31.041
- I think you want to make it as--
- I'm gonna!

12:31.125 --> 12:33.419
Listen, I feel like
the questions are more important,

12:33.502 --> 12:35.588
but I also hate the way this looks.

12:35.671 --> 12:36.755
What do you mean?

12:36.839 --> 12:38.174
I hate the way that--

12:38.257 --> 12:39.300
You're making me look bad.

12:39.383 --> 12:41.051
I'm just gonna ask the next question.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.386
Ask her the question.

12:43.012 --> 12:45.222
Can you account
for your whereabouts that day?

12:45.306 --> 12:47.641
Ha! Of course I know where I've been.

12:47.725 --> 12:50.186
You think I walk
through the world unconscious?

12:50.269 --> 12:52.897
Is this the sort of thing
you teach your trainees to ask?

12:52.980 --> 12:56.275
It was a stupid question, don't you think?
Look at these things. They're so perfect.

12:56.358 --> 12:57.776
- Thank you.
- You trying to show me up?

12:57.860 --> 12:58.694
- Yes.
- 'Cause mine looks like--

12:58.777 --> 13:00.196
Wait. You are showing me up?

13:00.279 --> 13:01.322
Alright. Oh!

13:04.575 --> 13:05.618
<i>Mon Dieu,</i> what are you doing?

13:05.701 --> 13:08.120
What are you doing? That's crazy.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.039
Okay, that is it.
If you cannot make <i>macaron,</i>

13:10.122 --> 13:12.374
you can stir vichyssoise. Not you. Her.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.043
Stir the vichyssoise, okay.

13:14.126 --> 13:15.794
You must remove all the lumps.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.463
Great. And what can I do for you?

13:17.546 --> 13:20.966
I think maybe you just stand there
and do whatever you do.

13:21.675 --> 13:23.719
God, the French are so sarcastic.

13:23.802 --> 13:25.471
Hey, detective.
Do you have any more questions for me?

13:25.554 --> 13:27.306
Go ahead, superstar.

13:27.389 --> 13:29.767
Can you ask me-- Well, I'm asking you.

13:29.850 --> 13:31.936
- I'm very distracted. I'm so sorry.
- Okay.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.480
Oh, boy. It's just--

13:34.563 --> 13:37.441
Have you recently traveled
to South-- Please?

13:37.525 --> 13:40.611
- What is happening to you?
- Don't-- I'm just-- I can't listen,

13:40.694 --> 13:43.113
I can't focus or hear what she's saying.

13:43.197 --> 13:46.283
I'm trying to help you. I am your partner.
This is what we were talking about.

13:46.367 --> 13:49.161
Mrs. DuBois,
have you traveled to South America?

13:49.245 --> 13:51.038
- Well, of course, I travel all the time.

13:51.121 --> 13:54.083
All over the world searching
for new flavors to integrate into---

13:54.166 --> 13:57.461
Oh, my God,
will you stop that infernal whistling?

13:57.545 --> 13:59.630
Excuse me! Sorry. Sorry.

13:59.713 --> 14:00.881
I told you I could whistle.

14:00.965 --> 14:03.884
I haven't heard one answer.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.386
Any more questions, pretty lady?

14:05.469 --> 14:06.512
Let me just…

14:06.595 --> 14:08.472
I would like you to…

14:09.890 --> 14:10.808
Okay?

14:10.891 --> 14:11.934
Now who's doing a good job?

14:12.017 --> 14:13.686
Why am I not hearing any stirring?

14:13.769 --> 14:15.563
Yeah, why aren't you stirring, Annie?

14:15.646 --> 14:17.147
Okay, this is what you get.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.066
Trying to be a goody two-shoes. Stir that.

14:19.149 --> 14:20.776
- With what?
- Keep stirring.

14:20.859 --> 14:21.735
Use your hands!

14:21.819 --> 14:23.946
- That is unsanitary.
- Just do it a little bit.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.657
She's gonna kick us out of here.
Just keep-- go in.

14:26.740 --> 14:29.743
Put more in. Oh, arm. There we go.
Stir it up.

14:29.827 --> 14:30.870
- There we go.
- I hate this.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.246
Okay, you have questions?

14:32.329 --> 14:33.330
- Yeah, I got a question.
- Yes.

14:33.414 --> 14:36.333
Why is Annie's arm in the vichyssoise?

14:36.417 --> 14:39.545
- What are you doing? You animal!
- What are you doing, Annie?

14:39.628 --> 14:40.421
I'm really sorry.

14:40.504 --> 14:42.047
Are you trying to get me shut down?

14:42.131 --> 14:43.549
I got carried away.

14:43.632 --> 14:44.925
That's it. Both of you out of my kitchen.

14:45.009 --> 14:46.552
- Get out.
- Yes, go.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.137
Can we get a little something to go?

14:48.220 --> 14:50.514
Because we kind of skipped lunch,
like a doggy bag or something.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.725
You think this is
some sort of "Rouge Lobster"

14:52.808 --> 14:54.852
since we have doggy bags
for little doggies?

14:54.935 --> 14:57.354
No. We have no bags, whatsoever.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.023
<i>Putain. Putain de merde.</i>

14:59.106 --> 15:01.191
- Sorry about your vichyssoise.
- <i>Merci.</i>

15:01.275 --> 15:02.735
Yeah, I'm sorry about my partner.

15:02.818 --> 15:05.362
<i>After hosing down Annie's arm,</i>

15:05.446 --> 15:09.158
<i>we headed to a local elementary school</i>
<i>to speak with Ms. Anya Campbell,</i>

15:09.241 --> 15:12.036
<i>a kindergarten teacher</i>
<i>who had a nasty run-in with the victim.</i>

15:12.119 --> 15:16.248
Hi! I'm Anya Campbell.
Welcome to room four.

15:16.332 --> 15:20.586
Yes, thank you. I am senior detective,
Terry Seattle.

15:20.669 --> 15:23.881
It's my partner, Annie Murphy, not senior,

15:23.964 --> 15:26.425
as in not as important.

15:26.508 --> 15:27.801
- Learning.
- Okay.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.386
We're from city homicide.

15:29.470 --> 15:32.264
Oh, the police! Well, that's wonderful.

15:32.348 --> 15:33.891
I tell all my kids,

15:33.974 --> 15:37.770
the police are here
to help you and to keep you safe.

15:37.853 --> 15:38.687
Mm.

15:40.105 --> 15:43.525
So listen, we got something pretty serious
that we need to discuss with you.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.861
Oh, well, then
let's head on over to the carpet

15:45.945 --> 15:47.905
and do some sharing, shall we?

15:47.988 --> 15:49.073
Circle Time.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.908
Ah, come on, I hate Circle Time.

15:50.991 --> 15:53.994
Eh, eh, em. We don't use the H word
in here, detective.

15:54.078 --> 15:56.121
Okay, very good.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.250
Criss-cross applesauce, friends.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.294
See, Annie knows how.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.421
Come on, detective.

16:05.214 --> 16:07.800
So what can I help you with?

16:07.883 --> 16:10.886
Well, we need to discuss with you…

16:11.720 --> 16:13.013
a murder.

16:13.597 --> 16:15.557
- Oh, dear.
- Tell her, Annie.

16:15.641 --> 16:18.811
We just found…

16:18.894 --> 16:22.481
a body floating in a bowl of tomato soup.

16:23.399 --> 16:27.486
And the man who owns that body--
owned that body--

16:27.569 --> 16:30.239
- So there's another man who owns the body?
- No…

16:30.322 --> 16:33.993
- That was misleading as well for me, too.
- I misspoke.

16:35.119 --> 16:37.162
The man whose body it was--

16:37.246 --> 16:38.080
Yes.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.207
And that dead man's name was…

16:44.962 --> 16:48.215
- Alf-- It's Alistair…
- Alf, it's not Alf.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.760
You sometimes…
when we are feeling sad,

16:51.844 --> 16:53.595
it's very hard to remember names.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.806
- It's my first day, I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

16:55.889 --> 16:58.017
The man whose body it was…

16:58.100 --> 16:59.101
Yes.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.602
Was named Alistair Hale.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.938
The health inspector? Oh…

17:03.022 --> 17:07.317
You know, when someone dies,
that can be a forever kind of sad, right?

17:07.401 --> 17:10.404
Do you want to talk about
what kind of feelings you're having?

17:10.904 --> 17:13.323
Just a little bit of frustration.

17:13.407 --> 17:17.619
Frustration, yeah. You're very good
at identifying your feelings. That's good.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.204
One, two, three. Eyes on me.

17:19.288 --> 17:20.956
What? Yes.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.168
Does Detective Seattle
sometimes struggle to maintain focus?

17:24.251 --> 17:25.794
I would say so, yeah.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.047
- I hate-- I can't see--

17:29.214 --> 17:33.177
I'm going to need you to be
my quiet coyote. Okay, Detective?

17:33.260 --> 17:36.388
Otherwise, you'll have to spend
some time on the thinking bench.

17:37.347 --> 17:39.016
What happens
on the thinking bench?

17:39.099 --> 17:41.894
You sit and think about what you've done.

17:42.936 --> 17:44.313
You know what?

17:44.396 --> 17:48.317
Why don't we do
a fun drawing activity while we talk?

17:48.400 --> 17:50.277
- Do you like drawing, detectives?
- No.

17:50.360 --> 17:51.445
Okay.

17:51.528 --> 17:54.073
This is driving me crazy.
Okay, I hate kindergarten.

17:54.156 --> 17:56.658
It's making me sleepy,
I feel like I'm going to cry.

17:56.742 --> 17:57.993
Okay, how are you dealing with this?

17:58.077 --> 18:00.704
Just part of the job description, right?

18:00.788 --> 18:04.833
Well, I would like each of you
to draw a self-portrait. Okay?

18:05.959 --> 18:08.170
Good. Alright, and now, how can I help?

18:08.253 --> 18:11.924
Tell us about
your run-in with Alistair Hale.

18:12.007 --> 18:14.426
Yeah, we were having
this bake sale to raise money

18:14.510 --> 18:16.178
for classroom supplies, you know.

18:16.261 --> 18:20.015
I mean the city's budget doesn't cover
all the stuff that you see around here.

18:20.099 --> 18:24.394
So each year, we hold a big bake sale
to make up the difference.

18:24.478 --> 18:28.190
And he just appeared
out of nowhere and shut it down.

18:28.273 --> 18:29.983
Oh, yeah. Look at this.

18:30.692 --> 18:31.985
That's a puppet.

18:32.069 --> 18:33.445
It's a puppet.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.322
I knew that was a puppet.

18:35.405 --> 18:37.241
All I want to do is poop.

18:37.324 --> 18:41.495
Terry, please take your self-portrait
over to the thinking bench.

18:41.578 --> 18:43.580
- Now.
- Oh, my God.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.999
- 1, 2…
- I'm going, I'm going.

18:46.083 --> 18:49.419
Buckle up. Shoes under your knees.

18:50.879 --> 18:54.967
Anyway, yes,
this inspector just shows up

18:55.050 --> 18:57.219
and says
that we don't have the proper permits,

18:57.302 --> 18:59.054
and that the kids
aren't wearing hair nets,

18:59.138 --> 19:01.723
and that no one is certified
in food handling.

19:01.807 --> 19:06.562
We had to throw everything
in the trash and he fined us $5,000.

19:06.645 --> 19:07.521
$5,000?

19:07.604 --> 19:10.399
- Yeah. So much for glue sticks this year.
- Right.

19:10.482 --> 19:13.235
Oh, my God, how much longer
do I have to be on this thinking bench?

19:13.318 --> 19:17.114
I really-- I gotta go pee
and I want to call my mom.

19:17.197 --> 19:18.282
What are you thinking about?

19:18.365 --> 19:20.284
You're supposed to be thinking
in a thinking bench.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.246
How I can be more polite.

19:24.329 --> 19:25.247
Mhm.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.624
And do you have
anything to say to Annie over here?

19:29.376 --> 19:30.752
Sorry for my behavior.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.881
Very good. Apology accepted.

19:33.964 --> 19:36.466
- That's so nice, Annie. Good job.
- Thank you.

19:36.550 --> 19:40.637
You know what? Why don't we look
at those self-portraits, okay?

19:40.721 --> 19:43.724
We're all done?
Terry, can you please rejoin the group?

19:44.516 --> 19:47.019
Put some pep in your step, Terry.

19:47.102 --> 19:49.229
- Annie, let me see yours.
- I have shin splints.

19:49.313 --> 19:54.776
Oh, wow. That is lovely.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.654
Oh, you are so good at your shapes.

19:57.738 --> 20:01.408
That's so nice.
You know a lot about science, too.

20:02.117 --> 20:03.744
- I do.
- Do you like science, Annie?

20:03.827 --> 20:05.621
Yep, I majored in Biology, so.

20:05.704 --> 20:08.290
- I can see that in your self-portrait.
- Thank you.

20:08.373 --> 20:09.875
We're going to just circle back.

20:09.958 --> 20:12.252
Have you ever traveled to South America?

20:12.336 --> 20:15.047
Well, I think traveling is a lot of fun

20:15.130 --> 20:18.592
and we actually have a travel board
that everyone fills out.

20:18.675 --> 20:20.761
There's a lot of fun places
that everybody can go.

20:21.386 --> 20:22.679
Alright, Terry.

20:22.763 --> 20:24.431
Let's see your self-portrait.

20:28.477 --> 20:29.728
Oh, Terry.

20:29.811 --> 20:32.022
I drew a wolf eating my neck.

20:32.105 --> 20:33.398
Okay, there's--

20:33.482 --> 20:35.400
That's actually the best wolf
I've ever drawn.

20:38.737 --> 20:41.698
<i>We had one more suspect</i>
<i>to interview and this time,</i>

20:41.782 --> 20:45.786
<i>Annie was going to have to go</i>
<i>deep undercover.</i>

20:48.705 --> 20:50.249
Okay, now listen.

20:50.332 --> 20:52.626
Our target is Vinny "The Fork" Palmieri.

20:52.709 --> 20:55.170
He's a crime boss
of the food truck mafia, alright?

20:55.254 --> 21:00.175
And my source tells me that they talked
to Alistair Hale right before he died.

21:00.884 --> 21:02.135
- So…
- Okay.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.137
- You ready?
- Yeah.

21:04.221 --> 21:07.140
I need you to hold this.
Alright, now listen…

21:07.975 --> 21:10.560
You're going in there alone,
so don't get caught.

21:10.644 --> 21:13.772
Okay? Because if you get caught,
this entire investigation is ruined.

21:14.356 --> 21:15.232
You'll be dead,

21:15.315 --> 21:18.068
but I'm going to be the one left
with all the paperwork, you know?

21:18.777 --> 21:20.112
I'm just trying to--

21:20.904 --> 21:22.030
I was just trying to get a voice going.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.282
Find your voice.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.242
- Okay, now listen.

21:25.826 --> 21:29.913
I am gonna be coaching you
via this earpiece. Okay?

21:29.997 --> 21:34.084
Put this in and you just say
exactly what I tell you to say

21:34.668 --> 21:35.627
and you'll be fine.

21:35.711 --> 21:37.045
- Hear me?
- Yeah.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.714
You got your voice?

21:38.797 --> 21:40.549
- Who are you?

21:40.632 --> 21:42.092
I'm Vinny, the champ.

21:42.175 --> 21:44.886
Nope, he's Vinny, "The Fork."

21:46.513 --> 21:47.764
You got this.

21:50.767 --> 21:51.852
Go ahead.

21:53.478 --> 21:54.646
Just get--

21:56.315 --> 21:57.149
Ow.

22:08.410 --> 22:12.372
<i>You're gonna do great,</i>
<i>just say exactly what I tell you to say.</i>

22:16.543 --> 22:17.586
Who the hell are you?

22:17.669 --> 22:19.171
My name is…

22:19.254 --> 22:22.090
My name is…

22:22.174 --> 22:23.717
<i>Johnny.</i>

22:23.800 --> 22:24.634
Johnny.

22:24.718 --> 22:25.844
<i>Maplecock.</i>

22:25.927 --> 22:27.429
Maplecock.

22:27.512 --> 22:30.932
<i>I'm commonly known as</i>
<i>"The Pancake King" in the tristate area.</i>

22:31.016 --> 22:32.934
Well, I'm commonly known

22:33.018 --> 22:36.438
as "The Pancake King"
of the tristate area.

22:36.521 --> 22:37.981
How come I ain't never heard of you?

22:38.065 --> 22:39.608
<i>Maybe you never heard of me…</i>

22:39.691 --> 22:41.943
Yeah, maybe you never heard of me…

22:42.027 --> 22:45.614
<i>You got dog poop inside</i>
<i>your head instead of brains.</i>

22:45.697 --> 22:47.032
Because…

22:47.115 --> 22:50.827
Because you got dog poop inside
your head instead of brains.

22:50.911 --> 22:52.204
The hell you say?

22:52.287 --> 22:54.081
<i>I said I just moved here from Hartford.</i>

22:54.164 --> 22:56.166
I said I just moved here from Hartford.

22:56.249 --> 22:57.626
- Hartford!
- Yeah.

22:57.709 --> 22:59.878
The City of Lights. What a cultural mecca.

22:59.961 --> 23:03.048
I'd like to visit
but the feds took away my passport!

23:03.131 --> 23:04.049
<i>The feds!</i>

23:04.132 --> 23:06.927
The fed--

23:07.010 --> 23:08.428
The feds.

23:08.512 --> 23:11.181
Boss, Hartford's in Connecticut.
You don't need a passport.

23:11.264 --> 23:12.599
What asked you nothing?

23:12.682 --> 23:14.768
<i>- Who nothing you.</i>
- Who nothing you.

23:14.851 --> 23:16.436
I don't even know
what you guys are saying.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.896
Exactly.

23:17.979 --> 23:19.189
<i>You got that right.</i>

23:19.272 --> 23:21.358
Yeah, you bet that.

23:21.441 --> 23:25.403
What can I do for you,
Mr. Pancake King?

23:25.487 --> 23:26.863
<i>I would like your blessing.</i>

23:26.947 --> 23:28.365
I would like your blessing.

23:28.448 --> 23:31.952
<i>To sell my delicious</i>
<i>Connecticut-style pancakes.</i>

23:32.035 --> 23:35.997
To sell my delicious
Connecticut-style pancakes.

23:36.081 --> 23:37.707
<i>From my food truck.</i>

23:38.333 --> 23:42.087
From-- from… my food truck.

23:42.170 --> 23:43.880
What's your truck called?

23:43.964 --> 23:46.133
<i>Flapjack Orgasm.</i>

23:47.050 --> 23:48.009
Flap…

23:49.678 --> 23:51.263
Flapjack Orgasm.

23:51.346 --> 23:53.181
Catchy name.
How'd you come up with the name?

23:53.265 --> 23:55.725
<i>I just thought of two things</i>
<i>your mom likes.</i>

23:55.809 --> 23:57.894
I just thought of two things
your mom likes.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.563
What the hell did you say?

23:59.646 --> 24:00.522
I s--

24:00.605 --> 24:03.400
<i>Oh, God.</i>
<i>Just put the box down on the table.</i>

24:03.483 --> 24:06.528
Let me-- Let me put this down right here.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.655
<i>I got some gifts for yous.</i>

24:08.738 --> 24:10.031
I brought you some gifts.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.617
<i>I got you a PlayStation 2.</i>

24:12.701 --> 24:15.620
I got yous a PlayStation 2.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.706
<i>36 issues of</i> Maxim <i>magazines.</i>

24:17.789 --> 24:21.168
36 issues of <i>Maxim</i> magazine.

24:21.251 --> 24:23.587
<i>And a "Take me drunk, I'm home" t-shirt.</i>

24:23.670 --> 24:26.256
And a "Take me drunk, I'm home" t-shirt.

24:29.009 --> 24:30.093
So…

24:38.351 --> 24:39.895
A generous offering.

24:39.978 --> 24:44.858
You have my blessing to sell
your delicious Connecticut-style pancakes.

24:44.941 --> 24:46.943
<i>One question I need to ask.</i>

24:47.027 --> 24:49.070
One question I must ask.

24:49.154 --> 24:51.364
<i>Will the health inspector be an issue?</i>

24:51.448 --> 24:53.700
Will the health inspector be an issue?

24:55.035 --> 24:55.869
<i>Laugh.</i>

24:57.537 --> 25:00.165
Nobody's gotta
worry about that guy no more.

25:00.874 --> 25:01.833
<i>Laugh harder.</i>

25:02.918 --> 25:04.336
<i>Laugh harder than them.</i>

25:04.419 --> 25:08.798
<i>Hold your stomach,</i>
<i>hold your stomach.</i>

25:10.800 --> 25:12.552
<i>That was hilarious, what you said.</i>

25:12.636 --> 25:14.596
That was hilarious, what you said.

25:14.679 --> 25:17.557
That guy Hale was causing us problems
all over town.

25:17.641 --> 25:19.017
You couldn't reason with him.

25:19.100 --> 25:20.810
You know, we even brought him in
for a sit-down.

25:20.894 --> 25:23.271
- You know, to wet his beak?
- Yeah.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.357
But he wouldn't take a bribe,
so what're you gonna do?

25:25.440 --> 25:26.358
<i>Maybe murder him.</i>

25:26.441 --> 25:27.817
Yeah, maybe murder him.

25:28.944 --> 25:33.323
You know, I happen to be
a big pancake guy myself.

25:33.406 --> 25:35.909
What do you work with, a griddle or pan?

25:35.992 --> 25:37.327
<i>Um…</i>

25:37.410 --> 25:39.162
<i>I cook it with a-- in a pot.</i>

25:39.246 --> 25:41.206
I cook 'em more in a pot.

25:41.289 --> 25:43.124
You cook them in a pot?

25:43.792 --> 25:45.794
- Yeah.
- <i>I steam them, then I boil them.</i>

25:45.877 --> 25:47.754
I steam them, and then I boil them.

25:47.837 --> 25:50.298
You boil your pancakes?

25:50.382 --> 25:53.468
<i>Annie, I'm in over my head</i>
<i>with all this pancake talk.</i>

25:53.551 --> 25:54.844
Something's off about this guy.

25:54.928 --> 25:57.222
Yeah, I don't think so.

25:57.305 --> 25:59.516
- I just can't--
- Hey! Hey, what's the big idea?

25:59.599 --> 26:00.892
Found this guy around the corner.

26:02.852 --> 26:04.187
You alright?

26:04.271 --> 26:07.524
Terry Seattle. I should've known.

26:08.316 --> 26:10.819
You know, I don't know
what you're trying to pin on us,

26:10.902 --> 26:13.321
but I ain't going to stick around
to find out.

26:14.489 --> 26:16.741
Fire up the truck.
We're moving out.

26:16.825 --> 26:17.951
What do you want us to do with him, boss?

26:18.034 --> 26:19.911
Tie 'em up and throw 'em in the freezer.

26:19.995 --> 26:22.872
Hope whoever discovers you
is in the mood for dessert

26:22.956 --> 26:26.710
'cause they're going to find
a couple cop-sicles.

26:27.794 --> 26:29.754
Because you're police, and you're frozen.

26:30.505 --> 26:33.049
Oh, God. I can't believe
it's gonna end like this.

26:33.675 --> 26:34.926
It's gonna end like this?

26:35.010 --> 26:37.762
Yeah. I'm really sorry, Annie.

26:37.846 --> 26:41.349
You trusted me and now
you're gonna die because of it.

26:41.433 --> 26:44.728
And I can't help but feeling that
I'm a little bit responsible for that.

26:44.811 --> 26:47.731
Yeah, I thought
it was going pretty well in there.

26:49.190 --> 26:50.775
If I could do it all over…

26:52.193 --> 26:53.903
I'd have to say that I probably…

26:55.113 --> 26:58.074
Probably learn what a pancake was
before sending you in there.

26:58.992 --> 27:00.702
That would have been helpful, yeah.

27:00.785 --> 27:02.329
You know my biggest regret?

27:02.412 --> 27:05.248
I never went to Broadway
to see Tommy Tune Live.

27:05.332 --> 27:07.125
I don't know what--

27:07.208 --> 27:10.128
Tommy Tune. Song and dance man.

27:12.630 --> 27:13.965
Kind of without equal.

27:14.632 --> 27:16.551
- None of that matters now.
- I knew that. No.

27:17.510 --> 27:20.847
We're stuck in here and
there's no way out. I can't believe it.

27:20.930 --> 27:22.640
I just…

27:23.224 --> 27:24.642
I can't believe that--

27:25.226 --> 27:28.229
- that we're going to be in here for--
- What the--

27:29.272 --> 27:30.231
What?

27:31.107 --> 27:33.234
How long have you had your hands out?

27:36.446 --> 27:39.491
<i>After somehow</i>
<i>managing to untie ourselves,</i>

27:39.574 --> 27:43.536
<i>we lured all three suspects</i>
<i>to Chez Nanette for a special meal.</i>

27:43.620 --> 27:47.040
<i>On the menu that evening</i>
<i>was chicken catch a killer.</i>

27:47.123 --> 27:48.917
Well, here we are.

27:49.626 --> 27:51.044
You looked at all the evidence.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.296
You've talked to the suspects

27:53.380 --> 27:58.301
and now it's time
to serve up some justice.

27:58.385 --> 28:01.054
I want you to place this platter
in front of the person

28:01.137 --> 28:03.723
you think killed Alistair Hale.

28:03.807 --> 28:06.142
Was it Chef Nanette,

28:06.226 --> 28:11.481
Miss Anya Campbell, or Vinny "The Fork"?

28:11.564 --> 28:14.025
I want you to say their name,
and say it loud,

28:14.109 --> 28:16.820
and really make a meal out of it.

28:39.926 --> 28:41.678
Miss Anya Campbell.

28:44.264 --> 28:45.807
What is going on here?

28:45.890 --> 28:48.309
Chief, my partner, Annie Murphy,

28:48.393 --> 28:50.937
just figured out who killed Alistair Hale.

28:51.020 --> 28:52.188
Oh, you did, did you?

28:52.272 --> 28:53.982
And why do you think it was Anya?

28:54.065 --> 28:58.528
Number one,
there was a map in her classroom

28:58.611 --> 29:02.323
telling people where people
had traveled in the world

29:02.407 --> 29:06.327
and her name was on it twice,
in South America.

29:06.411 --> 29:09.247
Second of all,
she had quite a whistle on her.

29:09.914 --> 29:12.834
And also I noticed that

29:12.917 --> 29:14.043
when we were at the murder scene,

29:14.127 --> 29:18.006
the letters that rated the restaurants

29:18.089 --> 29:21.968
were arranged in order A, B, and C.

29:22.886 --> 29:26.306
Much like kindergarten teachers
teach their students.

29:26.389 --> 29:30.852
So I was wondering if maybe
this was kind of like a last gasp

29:30.935 --> 29:36.524
from our victim pointing out
who the murderer was.

29:36.608 --> 29:41.154
Annie Murphy,
you have just used some wild logic.

29:41.237 --> 29:44.282
You missed clues and completely
made up some others.

29:44.365 --> 29:48.244
Your reasoning, frankly,
borders on conspiracy theories.

29:48.328 --> 29:50.497
Annie Murphy, you are….

29:54.334 --> 29:56.628
- You are correct.
- Yeah!

29:58.129 --> 30:00.006
- Wow.
- Amazing work.

30:00.089 --> 30:02.842
The killer was obviously
the kindergarten teacher.

30:02.926 --> 30:07.263
You correctly noted that the "Places We've
Been" map in Anya Campbell's classroom

30:07.347 --> 30:09.766
<i>proved that she traveled to Colombia</i>

30:09.849 --> 30:13.061
where the deadly frog poison
could be found.

30:13.144 --> 30:15.396
Her classroom was filled with paper bags

30:15.480 --> 30:18.316
<i>identical to the one</i>
<i>used to carry the soup.</i>

30:18.399 --> 30:22.237
Anya even whistled, just like the killer,
to get Terry's attention.

30:23.404 --> 30:25.615
It couldn't have been Nanette.
She hated whistling.

30:26.324 --> 30:29.285
Oh, my God,
will you stop that infernal whistling!

30:29.369 --> 30:30.995
Scuse me. Sorry.

30:31.079 --> 30:34.207
And while Vinny used a white paper bag
to hold the bribe money,

30:34.290 --> 30:36.125
he couldn't have traveled to Colombia.

30:36.209 --> 30:38.336
But the feds took away my passport.

30:38.419 --> 30:40.839
But the nail in Anya's coffin

30:40.922 --> 30:45.552
<i>was the deadly animals textbook</i>
<i>on the corner of her desk.</i>

30:46.302 --> 30:48.972
What kind of kindergarten teacher
would need that?

30:49.681 --> 30:51.933
The murdering kind.

30:52.016 --> 30:53.059
Take her away.

30:53.142 --> 30:55.562
I did it for the children.

30:55.645 --> 30:57.397
You know, Annie.

30:58.273 --> 30:59.774
Tell them!

30:59.858 --> 31:03.236
Well, looks like she's about to get
25 years to life…

31:03.862 --> 31:05.697
on the thinking bench.

31:07.198 --> 31:08.449
- Remember?
- Yeah.

31:08.533 --> 31:09.784
- When I was on the--
- I do.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.828
Congratulations, Annie Murphy.

31:11.911 --> 31:14.372
I'm proud. You go, girl.

31:15.206 --> 31:16.916
Well, great job, Annie.

31:17.792 --> 31:18.668
Put 'er there, partner.

31:18.751 --> 31:19.878
Put 'er right there, partner.

31:19.961 --> 31:22.338
You had a hell of a run
and you make a terrific partner.

31:23.089 --> 31:25.592
Well, I tell you
what I could really go for right now.

31:25.675 --> 31:26.926
What?

31:27.010 --> 31:29.762
I could go for a whole bushel of pancakes.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.056
Let's talk it out, okay?

31:32.140 --> 31:33.725
- They don't serve them by the--
- No.

31:33.808 --> 31:34.684
Okay.

31:35.184 --> 31:36.728
Have you ever had a pancake before?

31:36.811 --> 31:38.104
I don't think I have.

31:38.187 --> 31:40.940
<i>On the next episode</i>
<i>of</i> Murderville…

31:41.024 --> 31:43.067
Detective, meet Sharon Stone.

31:43.151 --> 31:44.402
Well, hello.

31:44.485 --> 31:48.573
Under no circumstances can you and I
fall in love with each other.

31:49.532 --> 31:51.701
Oh, my God! We have a little leak.

31:52.327 --> 31:53.912
This is not a first-day thing.
