WEBVTT

00:01.468 --> 00:02.803
All right, so most ballpark
hot dogs

00:02.803 --> 00:05.272
are either steamed or grilled,

00:05.272 --> 00:08.976
but Boston Bangers
are boiled first,

00:08.976 --> 00:10.978
and then they are grilled.

00:10.978 --> 00:13.547
That way, you preserve
the juiciness.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.382
Looks delicious.

00:15.382 --> 00:17.251
Oh, that's the beauty
of a Banger, baby.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.685
(chuckles)
Mmm.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.988
All right, all right,
small tent.

00:20.988 --> 00:23.924
-Can I get one of these things,
or what?
-Oh, yep, Sam. Here you go.

00:23.924 --> 00:25.893
-Incoming.
-Thank you.

00:26.226 --> 00:28.829
Looks pretty good for something
cooked in a parking lot.

00:29.630 --> 00:33.667
-So you're having a good time?
-Uh, yeah, yeah, I think so.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.036
-I'm having a good time, too.
-Nice.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.304
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

00:37.304 --> 00:39.640
Olivia keeps telling me
to be more present.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.842
And I, uh, think it's working.

00:41.842 --> 00:43.710
She's kind of
the best sponsor you can get.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.547
Yeah, she's very cool.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.983
Although...
I did read Eminem is a sponsor,

00:49.983 --> 00:52.452
and he might be
just a little bit cooler.

00:52.452 --> 00:53.854
BOB:
Ah, look at you two,

00:53.854 --> 00:55.923
getting along.
(chuckles)

00:55.923 --> 00:59.092
-Okay, you just made it weird.
-Yeah, stop being so weird, Bob.

00:59.092 --> 01:02.763
-Also, this needs mustard.
-Oh, yes, condiments, flying in.

01:02.763 --> 01:03.964
-(booing)
-Yeah, go home, Yankee!

01:03.964 --> 01:05.165
Yeah, okay, okay,
hi, yeah, yeah.

01:05.165 --> 01:07.467
Hey, where are your heels,
Carrie Bradshaw?

01:07.467 --> 01:08.635
Where's your tutu?

01:11.772 --> 01:12.940
No.

01:12.940 --> 01:15.642
Nathaniel? Hey, wait, hang on.

01:15.642 --> 01:17.444
Nathaniel!

01:17.444 --> 01:19.513
Just get to your car
and then you're home free.

01:19.513 --> 01:20.514
-Wait, wait.
-Okay.

01:20.514 --> 01:22.349
-Nathaniel.
-Just keep walking.

01:22.349 --> 01:23.650
Oh, hang on a second, man. Hey.

01:23.650 --> 01:25.118
(whoops, chuckles)

01:25.118 --> 01:27.688
Hi. Wow, uh, Sam Fink.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.656
Yeah. What are you doing
in Boston? How have you been?

01:29.656 --> 01:31.191
What's going on at Bzzzzzzzzzz?

01:31.191 --> 01:33.260
I'm gonna plead the Fifth
on your questions.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.028
'Cause I don't want
anything I say

01:35.028 --> 01:37.197
to be used against me by you.

01:37.197 --> 01:38.465
-Right?
-You caught me.

01:38.465 --> 01:40.300
Been following you for months.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.502
You know, been videotaping
everything you do,

01:42.502 --> 01:44.938
actually got in your trunk
on the way here.

01:45.539 --> 01:49.343
-I'm kidding.
-Oh, that's not super funny.

01:49.343 --> 01:50.978
-You maimed me.
-Right.

01:50.978 --> 01:53.113
Right? I had an eye patch
for a month.

01:53.113 --> 01:56.183
-I'm-I'm very sorry about that.
-Are you, though?

01:56.183 --> 02:00.220
I endured pirate jokes
every day for a month.

02:00.220 --> 02:02.389
I'm gonna give you a couple, so
you know what I lived through.

02:02.389 --> 02:05.392
"Aye, aye, Captain,"
'cause of my eye.

02:05.392 --> 02:07.127
-Pretty stupid.
-Pretty obvious.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.462
One that was
actually kinda decent,

02:08.462 --> 02:13.400
"Lance Arrrmstrong," right?
One eye, one nut.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.669
That was my life for a month,
because of you.

02:15.669 --> 02:18.038
Right, no, I am,
I am genuinely sorry,

02:18.038 --> 02:20.073
and I'm sober now,
seven months.

02:20.073 --> 02:21.375
-Oh.
-So...

02:21.375 --> 02:23.910
Well, that's good to hear.
I'm glad to hear it.

02:23.910 --> 02:27.447
Yeah, you do, uh,
you do seem less insane.

02:27.447 --> 02:28.949
I'm really happy
to hear that from you,

02:28.949 --> 02:31.318
a man that I respect
and regret maiming.

02:32.886 --> 02:34.321
-Yeah. Thank you.
-Yeah.

02:34.321 --> 02:35.656
Seriously, that piece
that you did

02:35.656 --> 02:37.457
on the, um,
the creepy judges,

02:37.457 --> 02:39.593
the one with the foot fetish,
I thought that was really great.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.662
-Oh, you saw that?
-Yeah.

02:42.295 --> 02:45.465
Yeah, it was a pretty fun piece.
I thought it turned out good.

02:46.233 --> 02:47.634
-Yeah.
-Oh, that's cool.

02:47.634 --> 02:49.002
So, what are you up to?

02:49.002 --> 02:51.238
Like, are you writing at all,
or what's up?

02:51.238 --> 02:54.608
Oh, uh, yeah, you know, just
like classic alcoholic stuff,

02:54.608 --> 02:57.611
some moral inventories
and, like, long amends letters,

02:57.611 --> 03:00.847
long apology letters and...
a ton of letters.

03:00.847 --> 03:04.251
Right. Well, is any of that
publishable? 'Cause, I mean...

03:04.251 --> 03:07.521
-I think we might actually
have something for you.
-Like a job?

03:08.088 --> 03:11.525
Yes, like a job. Listen,
your voice is really funny.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.193
You'll be really good for this,

03:13.193 --> 03:15.162
and plus, like,
everyone's so into women.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.497
Right? Everything now is like,

03:17.497 --> 03:19.299
"Oh, we got to get women,"
right?

03:19.299 --> 03:21.935
-Mm.
-Which is super important, okay?

03:21.935 --> 03:24.004
And obviously that's not
the only reason

03:24.004 --> 03:25.572
I'm bringing this up.

03:25.572 --> 03:27.774
But let me just be clear
about me saying that.

03:27.774 --> 03:29.710
For the record,
I, I don't really care.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.044
I'll take what I can get.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.846
Um, do you think Bzzzzzzzzzz

03:32.846 --> 03:34.014
would let me back
in the building?

03:34.014 --> 03:36.349
No, no, but I'm not
there anymore.

03:36.349 --> 03:38.885
I'm at Smug Media,
have you heard of it?

03:38.885 --> 03:40.587
I was at Doosh,
and then they were dicks,

03:40.587 --> 03:42.389
so I'm now at Smug Media.

03:42.389 --> 03:45.292
Listen, here's my card.
I want you to call my assistant.

03:45.292 --> 03:48.562
And let's, uh, let's get
something on the books.

03:48.562 --> 03:51.264
-Great.
-All right? I want you to send
me some writing.

03:51.264 --> 03:53.266
-Published, unpublished,
doesn't matter.
-Okay.

03:53.266 --> 03:55.435
Let me just see your stuff,
and we'll, we'll go from there.

03:55.435 --> 03:56.436
-All right?
-All right.

03:56.436 --> 03:57.437
All right,
I'll talk to you soon,

03:57.437 --> 03:58.939
-and go Yankees!
-No, Yankees suck!

03:58.939 --> 04:00.674
-(crowd booing)
-NATHANIEL: Go Yankees!

04:00.674 --> 04:02.542
Yeah, take those chicken legs
back where they belong,

04:02.542 --> 04:03.977
you little bitch!

04:03.977 --> 04:05.612
-NATHANIEL: What?
-MAN: Yankees suck!

04:05.612 --> 04:07.114
NATHANIEL:
Shut up!

04:10.917 --> 04:12.786
Nathaniel Nathaniel?

04:12.786 --> 04:14.888
The one who had you carried
out of the building

04:14.888 --> 04:16.156
by security guards?

04:16.156 --> 04:18.658
-BOB: Oh, no.
-No, she's being dramatic.

04:18.658 --> 04:21.762
Yes, Nathaniel. He seemed
really interested, actually.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.930
He said I looked great.
I figure, why not?

04:23.930 --> 04:25.832
You know, I just have to send
him some writing material,

04:25.832 --> 04:27.467
set up a meeting.

04:27.467 --> 04:29.002
I thought you hated it there.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.403
You said it was soul-killing.

04:30.403 --> 04:32.305
Why would you want to go
back to Bzzzzzzzzzz?

04:32.305 --> 04:34.040
Oh, no, he's at Smug Media now.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.342
It's actually
a much bigger deal.

04:35.909 --> 04:38.879
There are so many
opportunities for you here.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.714
You could intern
at The Boston Globe.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.182
I hate to break it to you.

04:42.182 --> 04:44.050
No one really cares about
The Boston Globe anymore.

04:44.050 --> 04:46.753
How can you say that?
Didn't you see Spotlight?

04:46.753 --> 04:49.156
Ooh, I love that flick.
Seen it five times.

04:49.156 --> 04:51.658
You saw Spotlight five times?

04:51.658 --> 04:54.561
Mark Ruffalo, what an actor.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.264
Samantha...

04:57.264 --> 05:01.401
We paid for private school,
we got you through NYU,

05:01.401 --> 05:04.304
you are a writer... writer.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.840
And New York? Bzzzzzzzzzz?

05:06.840 --> 05:09.643
Didn't the whole situation
make you want to drink?

05:09.643 --> 05:12.746
There were a lot of things
that made me want to drink, Mom.

05:20.453 --> 05:22.689
SAMANTHA:
Donna with the doughnuts,
what's up?

05:24.991 --> 05:26.560
Oh... my God.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.628
I've never seen you this happy.

05:28.628 --> 05:30.864
-Are you depressed?
-(laughs) No.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.732
My old boss might have
a job for me in New York.

05:32.732 --> 05:34.835
-Mm.
-Yeah, I thought
that door was closed,

05:34.835 --> 05:36.102
but you know what they say,

05:36.102 --> 05:39.673
when one door closes,
it, um... also opens.

05:40.407 --> 05:41.775
You nervous?

05:41.775 --> 05:43.977
No. Come on. No.

05:43.977 --> 05:46.313
I'm, I'm acting as if.

05:46.313 --> 05:48.982
Just like they tell us to.
Not nervous at all.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.450
Just as if.

05:50.450 --> 05:53.854
It's wild, though. Uh, a couple
investors from down there

05:53.854 --> 05:55.255
asked me to come
and pitch that sobriety app.

05:55.255 --> 05:57.023
Mm-hmm.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.358
I haven't found
the right time, though.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.627
How do you feel
about road trips?

06:00.627 --> 06:02.462
They seemed fun
in Thelma and Louise.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.764
You should come with me
tomorrow, you can be Thelma.

06:04.764 --> 06:07.067
Maybe you should ask
that girl Chloe.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.802
Oh, you mean
hot dance party Chloe?

06:08.802 --> 06:11.838
-Mm-hmm.
-Tiny, little, cute,
spin her around,

06:11.838 --> 06:14.241
-take her for a ride Chloe?
-All right, she's fine.
She's okay.

06:14.241 --> 06:16.009
-She's super hot.
-No, she's not.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.410
-Yeah, well...
-I only think you think that

06:17.410 --> 06:19.045
because she looks like you.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.881
-What?
-You guys look exactly the same.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.182
-We don't.
-Yeah, you do.

06:22.182 --> 06:23.550
It's a little weird.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.752
-She ghosted me,
or else I would.
-Yeah.

06:28.655 --> 06:32.325
-Are you gonna come or not?
We can eat bagels.
-No, I just don't think that...

06:32.325 --> 06:35.028
I don't think a trip together
is a good idea.

06:35.028 --> 06:37.364
You know? 'Cause, like,
is it a friend thing?

06:37.364 --> 06:38.965
Is it a romantic thing?
I don't know.

06:38.965 --> 06:40.000
It's a bagel thing.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.303
Okay. Uh, well, eat one for me.

06:43.303 --> 06:44.871
No.

06:44.871 --> 06:46.373
I'll eat two for me.

06:46.373 --> 06:48.375
Okay. Okay.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.076
(indistinct chatter)

06:50.076 --> 06:51.444
OLIVIA:
See you in there.

06:51.444 --> 06:53.046
See you inside.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.116
OLIVIA:
Hi.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.617
-Hey.
-Welcome.

06:57.617 --> 06:58.785
How are you?

06:59.319 --> 07:01.521
I'm fine. I'm... fine.

07:02.355 --> 07:05.058
Fine as in F-I-N-E?

07:05.058 --> 07:06.927
Freaked out, insecure,
neurotic, and emotional?

07:06.927 --> 07:07.928
(Carol chuckles)

07:07.928 --> 07:09.963
Acronym.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.898
You people love acronyms.

07:12.399 --> 07:14.501
Um, I'm Olivia.
Yeah, come on in.

07:14.501 --> 07:17.404
Yeah, I know. You're, uh,
my daughter's sponsor.

07:17.404 --> 07:18.705
(chuckles)

07:18.705 --> 07:20.340
You have a, a Peabody Award.

07:21.374 --> 07:23.376
And I'm a subscriber
to your podcast.

07:23.376 --> 07:24.844
I purchased your last book.

07:24.844 --> 07:26.546
I just--
I didn't read it yet because...

07:26.546 --> 07:28.949
drama in the book club.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.617
I'm Carol.

07:31.384 --> 07:33.620
-You're Sam's mom.
-Yes.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.722
You don't have to pretend
like you never heard of me.

07:35.722 --> 07:38.758
Oh, my God.
I've definitely heard of you.

07:38.758 --> 07:40.060
All good things.

07:41.494 --> 07:42.929
-What's up, Barry?
-Olivia.

07:44.564 --> 07:48.735
So, if you're open to it,
I would like to pick your brain.

07:48.735 --> 07:50.704
Well, you are welcome to join
us, the meeting's open.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.205
And Sam's actually in there.

07:52.205 --> 07:55.608
Yeah, no, I-- Sam does not need
to know I'm here.

07:55.608 --> 07:56.943
I want to talk to you alone.

07:56.943 --> 08:00.714
-Oh.
-It's a time-sensitive issue.

08:00.714 --> 08:03.383
-So could we get coffee?
-Uh, yeah.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.685
After the meeting.

08:05.685 --> 08:08.922
Just shoot me a text, and I'll,
I'll tell you when and where.

08:08.922 --> 08:11.925
Oh... I will text you right now.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.159
Okay. Great.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.794
I will text you now,
Olivia Elliot.

08:24.604 --> 08:26.606
You're not what I expected.

08:26.606 --> 08:29.042
What did you expect?

08:29.042 --> 08:32.078
Someone older,
who uses less creamer.

08:34.314 --> 08:36.649
So, what's going on?
Parents only come to me

08:36.649 --> 08:38.418
when their kids are pregnant
or drinking or both.

08:38.418 --> 08:40.887
Oh, no, no, no.
It's nothing like that.

08:40.887 --> 08:45.125
I... hope it's nothing
like that. She, um...

08:45.125 --> 08:48.528
she doesn't have a lot of luck
in that area.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.296
The getting lucky area.

08:50.930 --> 08:53.133
You said--
You said it was time sensitive?

08:53.133 --> 08:54.167
Yes.

08:54.167 --> 08:57.270
Samantha is up for a job
in New York.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.438
-I see.
-Mm-hmm.

08:58.438 --> 09:00.340
And?

09:00.340 --> 09:02.108
And what if she gets it?

09:02.108 --> 09:05.278
What if she goes and interviews
and gets it and she's gone?

09:05.278 --> 09:07.414
-Mm.
-Can you talk to her?

09:07.414 --> 09:09.282
Tell her not to go.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.484
Tell her she needs to stay
with me longer.

09:11.484 --> 09:13.319
And pay her rent on time.

09:14.821 --> 09:17.590
Okay, if she wants
to bring it up with me, sure.

09:17.590 --> 09:18.691
But seeing
as I haven't heard from her,

09:18.691 --> 09:19.793
I doubt she wants my advice.

09:19.793 --> 09:20.794
But...

09:21.995 --> 09:24.330
...what if this blows up
in her face?

09:24.330 --> 09:27.133
What if she fails?
What if it breaks her heart

09:27.133 --> 09:29.602
and we're back where we were
when she came here?

09:29.602 --> 09:30.770
Where?

09:30.770 --> 09:32.839
Look, sometimes sponsees fail.

09:32.839 --> 09:34.507
I have this phrase
I like to use with them

09:34.507 --> 09:35.942
when they call me crying:

09:35.942 --> 09:38.878
"Oh, so you decided
to call me now?"

09:38.878 --> 09:40.880
So... yeah.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.782
As her mother,

09:42.782 --> 09:44.684
I am asking you,

09:44.684 --> 09:48.354
tell her not to go. Samantha
does not belong in New York.

09:50.023 --> 09:53.560
My job as her sponsor
is to help her stay sober.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.996
Your job as a mother is
to have this conversation.

09:57.897 --> 09:59.999
Yes! I'm having
this conversation

09:59.999 --> 10:01.701
so you'll talk
to my daughter.

10:01.701 --> 10:03.803
You should talk
to your daughter.

10:04.704 --> 10:06.339
Okay. You're no help.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.008
You are just like Samantha.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.780
Sammy, I respect your right
to look like a hot mess,

10:13.780 --> 10:16.149
-but these dead ends hurt me.
-No, I know, just go for it.
Please.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.484
(gasps) Really?

10:17.484 --> 10:20.186
Aw, you never let me have
my way with your locks.

10:20.186 --> 10:21.488
No, I know, but I need
the bad bitch haircut

10:21.488 --> 10:22.922
to go with the crazy nails.

10:22.922 --> 10:26.226
Yes, bad bitch, bad bitch.
Which bad bitch? Joan Jett.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.393
-No, trim.
-No?

10:27.393 --> 10:29.062
-Trim.
-A trim?

10:29.062 --> 10:30.597
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God!

10:30.597 --> 10:32.098
If you really think a trim's
gonna land you this job,

10:32.098 --> 10:33.366
you're wrong.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.335
Okay, well, the trim's
gonna help, first of all.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.936
-Okay.
-Also, I just,
I just need to send

10:36.936 --> 10:38.771
something good to Nathaniel,
and I got it.

10:38.771 --> 10:42.041
You know? Which I will get on
very, very soon.

10:42.041 --> 10:43.877
Just, you know, send him
something you've already written

10:43.877 --> 10:45.278
and change the title.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.180
Yeah, he's read everything
I've already written.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.515
Well, you haven't written
anything new?

10:48.515 --> 10:49.516
Not really.

10:49.516 --> 10:50.550
I mean, I've been,
like, pretty busy

10:50.550 --> 10:52.585
with the grocery store and...

10:52.585 --> 10:55.488
Also, I really loved drinking
and writing, you know?

10:55.488 --> 10:58.424
Take two shots of tequila,
take out the laptop.

10:58.424 --> 11:00.560
Down two more shots,
you open it,

11:01.294 --> 11:03.696
and then just more shots
'cause it's fun.

11:03.696 --> 11:06.833
Man, can you imagine if I was
like shot, snip, shot, snip?

11:06.833 --> 11:08.835
-Sounds fun.
-Well, what do you do?

11:08.835 --> 11:11.437
All right, well, you know,
I've got my process.

11:11.437 --> 11:14.440
Every morning, I have a green
tea, which you sobers love,

11:14.440 --> 11:17.410
sing a verse of
"Man! I Feel Like a Woman,"

11:17.410 --> 11:20.313
three Hail Marys in the mirror.
Boom. Ready to slay.

11:20.914 --> 11:23.516
Huh. Yeah, I guess I'll have
to figure my own thing out.

11:25.151 --> 11:27.787
-I'm trying to give you
something here.
-No, I know. It's sweet.

11:27.787 --> 11:29.455
But I'm, I'm not worried, you're
more worried about it than I am.

11:29.455 --> 11:30.690
I'm, like, totally fine.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.193
-I mean, I'm not worried.
-Okay, great.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.361
You know, that being said,
I think I will have to bail

11:35.361 --> 11:37.463
on, uh, Baby Boss movie night
with you and Zack

11:37.463 --> 11:39.866
'cause I think I should just
get started, you know.

11:39.866 --> 11:42.669
It's Boss Baby.
The baby's the boss.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.470
He doesn't have a boss.

11:44.470 --> 11:47.073
♪ ♪

11:53.046 --> 11:54.514
(spits)

11:55.748 --> 11:57.750
(clears throat)

12:11.965 --> 12:13.399
I told her not to say anything,
dude,

12:13.399 --> 12:14.901
so that makes it not my fault.

12:14.901 --> 12:17.270
I don't know what to tell you.
Dude, just fire her, then.

12:17.270 --> 12:18.271
I don't give a shit, man.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.272
Hold on a second.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.042
All right, that comes to $16.53.

12:24.377 --> 12:27.046
-Cash. Old school. Sweet.
-Yeah.

12:27.046 --> 12:28.982
I'm supposed to check this
for something, aren't I?

12:28.982 --> 12:30.817
I feel like people always go...

12:30.817 --> 12:33.253
Yeah, it's-it's good.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.487
-Okay.
-Kind of in a rush here.

12:35.855 --> 12:38.791
-(computer beeping)
-Whoa, it's... No?

12:38.791 --> 12:41.327
That's, that's new.

12:41.327 --> 12:43.463
-Hang on.
-Are you, you kidding me, man?

12:45.365 --> 12:46.833
H-H-Hold on, dude.

12:46.833 --> 12:48.501
Manager to bakery.
Manager to bakery.

12:51.004 --> 12:54.374
-She'll be here in a sec.
-Hold on, dude, I'm dealing
with this stupid townie.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.976
-Excuse me?
-Uh, keep the change.

12:56.976 --> 12:59.145
-I just need my receipt, please.
-Okay. Uh-huh.

12:59.145 --> 13:02.015
Yeah, you're also shopping in
this town. You get that, right?

13:02.015 --> 13:04.050
You're just as much
of a townie as I am.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.785
The difference is,
I actually got out.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.121
I mean, I'm back temporarily,
but I will get out again.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.289
'Cause I'm a writer.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.990
Not, like, a super famous one,

13:10.990 --> 13:12.892
but I was recognized
in an H&M once.

13:12.892 --> 13:14.527
I think they thought
I was Selena Gomez,

13:14.527 --> 13:15.962
but I was still recognized,
all right?

13:15.962 --> 13:19.065
So, like, you know what,
dude-man, how about this?

13:19.065 --> 13:21.834
-Eat me. And keep your change.
-Whoa. No.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.603
-I don't need
your blood money, bro!
-You keep it.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.905
-It's...
-Wow, uh, I'm so sorry.

13:25.905 --> 13:27.273
Sam, can I talk to you?

13:28.941 --> 13:31.411
-Dude, I just need a receipt.
-(mockingly): Dude.

13:32.612 --> 13:35.381
Wait, you're this worked up
over a job interview?

13:35.381 --> 13:37.884
Well, I mean, yeah.
Like, what if I get it?

13:37.884 --> 13:41.754
What if I don't? What if I get
the seat on the bus

13:41.754 --> 13:43.790
next to the toilet?
It's a lot of risks.

13:43.790 --> 13:47.360
Girl, a bus ride and
a job interview are not risks.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.995
The only risk is
if you didn't clear it

13:48.995 --> 13:50.096
with your probation officer.

13:51.597 --> 13:52.598
Mm-hmm.

13:52.598 --> 13:53.800
'Cause then you go to jail.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.501
Right.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.303
Oh, of course you didn't.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.574
Well, thank you so much
for squeezing me in.

14:01.574 --> 14:02.975
I didn't realize
that I needed permission

14:02.975 --> 14:04.644
just to take, like,
a quick bus trip to New York.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.512
So, what, what should we do?

14:06.512 --> 14:09.749
Do I have to, like, write
a letter to the governor, or...?

14:09.749 --> 14:12.018
To tell him you have
a job interview?

14:12.018 --> 14:15.088
You don't have a job.
Like, nothing's official.

14:15.888 --> 14:17.990
Okay, it's like,
it's like this dude Jordan.

14:17.990 --> 14:21.060
He texts me
every single morning, like,

14:21.060 --> 14:23.830
"Oh, my God,
you are so beautiful!

14:23.830 --> 14:25.598
"When are you gonna meet my mom?

14:25.598 --> 14:27.066
Can I help you
with your cell phone bill?"

14:27.066 --> 14:29.702
Does that make him my boyfriend?

14:29.702 --> 14:32.739
No. Absolutely not.

14:32.739 --> 14:35.875
Have I had a pregnancy scare?
Multiple.

14:35.875 --> 14:39.379
Did I tell Jordan? No!
Again, not my boyfriend.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.080
You got to know your situation

14:41.080 --> 14:44.050
and then adjust
your expectations accordingly.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.885
What do I do if I get the job?

14:45.885 --> 14:47.487
You're gonna need
more than a letter.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.088
Ooh.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.326
I-I have to fill
all of that out?

14:53.326 --> 14:55.795
I have to fill this out.

14:55.795 --> 14:57.463
I'm just playing.
It's all online.

14:57.463 --> 14:59.265
But I want you to know...

14:59.265 --> 15:02.301
this is the kind of hell
you're gonna put me through.

15:02.301 --> 15:05.271
You just keep that on standby
just in case, huh?

15:05.271 --> 15:07.340
Um...

15:08.341 --> 15:10.109
Okay, but...

15:10.109 --> 15:13.179
you are good to go
for up to 72 hours.

15:13.179 --> 15:15.681
Oh, that was it? Wow, okay,
great, thank you so much.

15:15.681 --> 15:16.682
(laughs):
Okay.

15:16.682 --> 15:17.784
All right, bye, Gail.

15:17.784 --> 15:19.652
Tell Jordan I said hi.

15:19.652 --> 15:20.987
I won't.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.057
(doorbell ringing)

15:30.496 --> 15:32.665
-BRIT: Hi.
-Oh, hi.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.967
-Hey.
-Uh... come on in.

15:34.967 --> 15:36.702
Thanks.

15:36.702 --> 15:39.639
-What's up? Is everything okay?
-Yeah.

15:40.139 --> 15:41.841
Oh, is it the-the last $2,000?

15:41.841 --> 15:43.543
'Cause I'm gonna get it
as soon as I can.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.311
No, no, that's not it. Um...

15:46.045 --> 15:49.048
I just wanted to give you this.

15:49.048 --> 15:50.750
-What'd I win?
-(chuckles)

15:52.018 --> 15:54.587
Joel and I talked about it,
and, uh,

15:54.587 --> 15:56.556
maybe it would be nice
if you were at our wedding.

15:57.356 --> 15:59.559
'Cause, you know,
things feel different.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.861
Oh.

16:01.861 --> 16:02.929
-Right.
-Right.

16:04.263 --> 16:07.767
I'm sorry, I'm just realizing
that was kind of an ambush.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.769
Um, you don't have
to let us know now.

16:09.769 --> 16:12.638
Yeah, I'll... figure it out.

16:13.673 --> 16:14.674
-Cool.
-Yeah.

16:14.674 --> 16:15.908
-Cool. Okay.
-Great.

16:15.908 --> 16:18.444
-I'm gonna...
-Oh. Okay. (chuckles)

16:21.113 --> 16:22.949
-Cool.
-All right.

16:22.949 --> 16:25.952
(door opens and closes)

16:25.952 --> 16:29.288
BOB:
And a little more for me. Oh.

16:29.288 --> 16:31.290
Okay. I'm gonna talk to her.

16:31.290 --> 16:32.758
She can't go. That's it.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.695
On second thought...

16:35.695 --> 16:38.097
I'm gonna go roast a chicken.

16:38.097 --> 16:39.832
Carol, just talk to her.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.834
No!

16:41.834 --> 16:44.070
Trust me,
the chicken will work better.

16:44.070 --> 16:45.838
The way I do it,

16:45.838 --> 16:48.241
first you, you pat it dry.

16:48.241 --> 16:49.842
That's the most important part.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.011
Then you sprinkle it
really liberally with salt

16:52.011 --> 16:53.012
and you take a stick of butter

16:53.012 --> 16:54.313
and you shove it
up under the skin,

16:54.313 --> 16:56.849
and that chicken will say
everything better

16:56.849 --> 16:58.251
than I ever could.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.585
Well, that does sound delicious,

16:59.585 --> 17:01.554
but you should just talk to her.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.155
Hmm?

17:03.155 --> 17:04.156
(sighs)

17:09.228 --> 17:11.330
(knocking on door)

17:13.499 --> 17:15.434
How was your day?

17:15.434 --> 17:18.571
Oh, uh, yeah, it's fine. Um...

17:19.605 --> 17:21.440
Brit invited me to her wedding.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.677
Oh. Maybe we could sit
at the same table.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.248
I know it's not fun.
I know it's weird.

17:29.248 --> 17:31.183
I could hold your hand.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.387
You know, uh...

17:34.387 --> 17:37.089
I don't really want to go,
actually, and I...

17:37.089 --> 17:39.158
don't really want to hold
your hand either,

17:39.158 --> 17:40.726
but thanks for offering.

17:43.162 --> 17:44.263
What are you writing?

17:44.263 --> 17:47.099
Oh, uh, yeah.
Just a piece about...

17:47.099 --> 17:49.302
you know, Gen Z and...

17:49.302 --> 17:51.571
morality and...

17:51.571 --> 17:53.773
-Birkenstocks.
-Oh.

17:54.407 --> 17:57.410
Can I see? Bob wears them.
They help his back.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.845
No, it's not,
it's not really ready yet.

18:01.547 --> 18:03.749
Samantha, just me--
let me take a look.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.251
-Mom.
-No, I won't judge.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.920
I don't want you to see it.
So, sorry, I...

18:09.755 --> 18:11.791
I haven't written anything.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.359
Why not?

18:13.793 --> 18:16.929
I-I can't write
unless I'm drunk, I guess.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.698
I don't know,
I can like, you know,

18:18.698 --> 18:22.168
work in a grocery store
and go to Brit's stupid wedding

18:22.168 --> 18:25.071
and go on
some pretty bad coffee dates,

18:25.071 --> 18:28.240
but I-I cannot write
without alcohol.

18:28.240 --> 18:29.542
(sighs)

18:29.542 --> 18:31.477
I don't know what to tell you.
I can't.

18:34.347 --> 18:35.715
Samantha, here's the thing.

18:37.350 --> 18:40.886
Nobody does
anything better drunk.

18:40.886 --> 18:42.521
Do you really think

18:42.521 --> 18:45.524
everything you wrote then
was so wonderful?

18:45.524 --> 18:47.360
Where are the book sales?

18:47.360 --> 18:50.429
Where are the Pulitzers?
Come on.

18:50.429 --> 18:52.698
Is Bzzzzzzzzzz
the best you can do?

18:53.466 --> 18:56.469
I-I don't know.
At least it was something.

18:57.103 --> 18:59.639
You don't know
what you're capable of now.

18:59.639 --> 19:02.008
So, you're gonna
lock yourself in

19:02.008 --> 19:03.843
and write something. Tonight.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.177
Anything.

19:05.945 --> 19:08.214
Because, even if it sucks,

19:08.214 --> 19:12.218
it will still be good enough
for Smug News.

19:12.218 --> 19:14.220
No, it...

19:14.220 --> 19:15.488
(Carol sighs)

19:15.488 --> 19:17.390
Now I'm gonna go
roast a chicken.

19:17.390 --> 19:20.359
And I'll bring it in to you.

19:20.359 --> 19:21.360
(sighs)

19:24.230 --> 19:26.232
(door closes)

19:27.633 --> 19:29.135
(phone buzzes)

19:40.880 --> 19:42.882
(indistinct chatter)

19:44.450 --> 19:46.552
(clears throat)
Excuse me, miss.

19:46.552 --> 19:49.055
Is this bus going
to the Big Apple?

19:49.055 --> 19:50.423
Wild.

19:50.423 --> 19:53.726
Yeah, I'm sorry, I don't even
know why I tried that...

19:53.726 --> 19:55.227
-You changed your mind.
-I did.

19:55.227 --> 19:56.862
I felt like you needed
a sober trudging buddy.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.264
-Mm.
-I remember my first sober trip,

19:58.264 --> 20:00.232
and I could've used a me.

20:00.232 --> 20:02.334
To be with, to be with me,
you know.

20:02.334 --> 20:04.870
-I get it. We'll trudge.
-Yeah, let's do it.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.372
Can we get back in line now?
'Cause I lost my spot.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.907
Uh, yeah, yeah,
oh, yeah, let's do it.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.042
-We're gonna get bad seats.
-We are.
