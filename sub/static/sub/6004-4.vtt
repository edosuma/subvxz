WEBVTT

00:08.131 --> 00:09.915
I am Groot.

00:09.916 --> 00:13.001
See? I got closer to
the target than you did.

00:13.002 --> 00:14.886
This is not a competition.

00:14.887 --> 00:17.723
I notice you only say that when you lose.

00:19.675 --> 00:21.760
Drax: We are under attack.

00:21.761 --> 00:23.762
Yeah, by Quill's lousy piloting.

00:23.763 --> 00:25.850
Huh? Maybe I'd do better

00:25.851 --> 00:28.936
if the controls weren't
rodent... uh, you-sized.

00:28.937 --> 00:31.021
Eh, so I made a few modifications.

00:31.022 --> 00:34.892
Well, next time you modify
something on my ship, ask.

00:34.893 --> 00:37.144
Hey, I've fixed up at
least half of this junker.

00:37.145 --> 00:40.064
By now, it's more mine
than yours.

00:40.065 --> 00:42.816
Announcer: <i>Conjunction!
Come for the thrills!</i>

00:42.817 --> 00:44.869
What'd you steer us into this time?

00:44.870 --> 00:49.156
<i>Conjunction! Come for the action!</i>

00:49.157 --> 00:53.210
<i>Conjunction! Come for the thrills!</i>

00:53.211 --> 00:56.046
Oh, now that's what I'm talking about!

00:56.047 --> 00:58.048
What I wouldn't do

00:58.049 --> 01:00.885
to get my paws on one of those sweet rides.

01:00.886 --> 01:03.087
Uh-uh, this trip is strictly business.

01:03.088 --> 01:06.840
If we're gonna unlock the secrets of
my boom box, we need Pandorian Crystals.

01:06.841 --> 01:10.461
And it just so happens my
old buddy, Lunatik, has one.

01:11.980 --> 01:14.932
What?
- The man's name is "Lunatic"?

01:14.933 --> 01:17.351
He spells it with a "k", not a "c."

01:22.240 --> 01:24.158
That is a very long list of crimes.

01:24.159 --> 01:27.778
Okay, so he's less a "buddy"
than an "occasional contact".

01:27.779 --> 01:29.113
He's a dangerous mobster, really.

01:29.114 --> 01:31.949
Oh, well, then he's probably a swell guy.

01:31.950 --> 01:33.867
What could go wrong?

01:35.253 --> 01:38.289
I mean, apart from the fact that
your ship is a piece of flarg?

01:38.290 --> 01:41.258
Peter: Hey, how come when it does
anything cool, it's your ship,

01:41.259 --> 01:43.093
but when it's falling apart, it's mine?

01:43.094 --> 01:44.929
Rocket: Think you just
answered your own question.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.880
Gamora: Hull breach!
We're losing life support.

01:46.881 --> 01:50.050
Rocket: By "earned" you mean "steal"
from your pirate buddy, yondu!

01:50.051 --> 01:54.138
I am Groot!

01:54.139 --> 01:55.940
I have it. I have it!

01:55.941 --> 01:57.141
Not a competition.

01:57.142 --> 02:00.978
Better compete to strap in so
maybe you survive this crash.

02:00.979 --> 02:03.981
Gamora: When you're raised by
Thanos, everything is a competition.

02:03.982 --> 02:05.232
You lose, you die.

02:05.233 --> 02:07.554
Rocket: Bad word choice!

02:09.000 --> 02:15.074

Scan for something soft!

02:25.703 --> 02:27.119
That is not soft!

02:47.185 --> 02:49.319
Thank you. We're here all week.

02:49.320 --> 02:51.471
Don't forget to tip your guardians.

02:54.075 --> 02:58.195
Hmmm, vandal. Vermin. Vegetable.

02:58.196 --> 02:59.329
Wait...

02:59.330 --> 03:02.032
Drax the Destroyer?

03:02.033 --> 03:04.334
And the infamous daughter of Thanos?

03:04.335 --> 03:08.238
This game is so on.

03:09.207 --> 03:12.125
Rocket: Yeah... This one's yours.

03:12.126 --> 03:15.045
Freeze, freaks.

03:15.046 --> 03:16.213
Reckless endangerment.

03:16.214 --> 03:18.048
Landing without clearance.

03:18.049 --> 03:20.184
Parking in a red zone.

03:20.185 --> 03:23.053
You lowlifes are so busted.

03:23.054 --> 03:25.222
Whoa, easy there, kitty cat.

03:25.223 --> 03:28.392
The name is Corpsman Titus, punk.

03:28.393 --> 03:30.360
Well, obviously you didn't get the memo

03:30.361 --> 03:32.396
about the Guardians of The Galaxy.

03:32.397 --> 03:35.232
Saviors of your Nova Corps home planet?

03:35.233 --> 03:39.152
Expunged criminal records.
Any of this ring a bell?

03:39.153 --> 03:45.042
I know who you are, and once
a lowlife, always a lowlife.

03:45.043 --> 03:48.328
<i>Welcome to Conjunction,
Nova Corpsman Titus.</i>

03:48.329 --> 03:50.130
<i>I am your host.</i>

03:50.131 --> 03:53.417
The Grandmaster. I know who you are, too.

03:53.418 --> 03:57.254
<i>Then you know my reputation
for putting on a good show.</i>

03:57.255 --> 03:59.223
<i>Like this one.</i>

03:59.224 --> 04:03.393
<i>Rest assured, no one
was ever in danger.</i>

04:03.394 --> 04:05.929
<i>Please release them.</i>

04:05.930 --> 04:08.982
You see this property
damage? Not gonna happen.

04:08.983 --> 04:13.070
<i>The property belongs to me, so
I'll be covering all damages.</i>

04:13.071 --> 04:18.942
<i>After all, what happens on
Conjunction stays on Conjunction.</i>

04:18.942 --> 04:22.279
<i>And I trust my new
guests will stay a while?</i>

04:22.280 --> 04:24.448
<i>I'm assuming you'd rather
take this transport</i>

04:24.449 --> 04:28.952
<i>to my luxury suite than argue
with local law enforcement.</i>

04:28.953 --> 04:30.320
D'ast right!

04:33.124 --> 04:35.259
This isn't over.

04:35.260 --> 04:36.960
Peter: Swanky.

04:36.961 --> 04:38.295
Gamora: Something doesn't smell right.

04:38.296 --> 04:40.964
Drax: I detect no unusual odor.

04:46.104 --> 04:49.339
Okay, maybe we should've taken
our chances with the Nova Corpsman.

04:51.225 --> 04:54.394
No, I like my chances just fine.

05:02.236 --> 05:03.987
I am Groot!

05:06.207 --> 05:08.575
Prepare to be...
- Too slow.

05:10.078 --> 05:11.328
Just saying.

05:11.329 --> 05:13.914
Grandmaster:- Oh, forgive the theatrics.

05:13.915 --> 05:17.301
I just had to see you two fight in person.

05:17.302 --> 05:19.169
Drax the Destroyer.

05:19.170 --> 05:21.054
A huge fan.

05:21.055 --> 05:24.224
And the lovely, lethal Gamora.

05:24.225 --> 05:27.094
Your reputation precedes you.

05:27.095 --> 05:29.146
As do yours, Rocket.

05:29.147 --> 05:32.299
Groot. And, um...

05:34.268 --> 05:37.104
Star... come on.

05:37.105 --> 05:39.072
Lord? Star-Lord?

05:39.073 --> 05:41.108
Seriously? Nothing?

05:41.109 --> 05:43.160
Yes, a pleasure.

05:43.161 --> 05:45.195
Oh, I just had a brilliant idea.

05:45.196 --> 05:49.032
The only thing better than seeing
the two of you fight together

05:49.033 --> 05:50.951
would be seeing you fight

05:50.952 --> 05:52.252
each other.

05:52.253 --> 05:56.123
"The most dangerous
woman in the galaxy versus

05:56.124 --> 06:00.043
"the most destructive
force in the universe!"

06:00.044 --> 06:03.430
I arrange it, of course. And
you get a share of the profits.

06:03.431 --> 06:06.216
We are not interested.

06:06.217 --> 06:07.384
Afraid?

06:07.385 --> 06:09.302
For you.

06:09.303 --> 06:12.222
The Guardians do not fight each
other for anyone's entertainment.

06:12.223 --> 06:13.390
Peter: I would.

06:13.391 --> 06:16.143
Seriously, how much you paying? Anyone?

06:16.144 --> 06:19.312
Hello? Think, buddy.

06:19.313 --> 06:21.398
We could use the dough to fix up my ship.

06:21.399 --> 06:23.116
Oh, totally.

06:23.117 --> 06:25.118
And not "your ship."

06:25.119 --> 06:26.370
We are leaving.

06:26.371 --> 06:28.605
And we are not fighting.

06:29.374 --> 06:32.292
Oh, you will fight.

06:32.293 --> 06:34.277
I guarantee it.

06:40.084 --> 06:41.418
Hey, don't think I ain't noticed

06:41.419 --> 06:43.303
that every shop in this glitz-teroid

06:43.304 --> 06:46.390
has jacked up their prices
only for the parts we need!

06:46.391 --> 06:50.343
We must find a way to get
the money we require. But how?

06:51.012 --> 06:53.063
I am Groot?

06:53.064 --> 06:54.398
Are you kidding?

06:54.399 --> 06:58.985
With that kind of prize money,
we could afford a real ship.

06:58.986 --> 07:01.021
I did not come here to fight.

07:01.022 --> 07:04.908
Oh, come on. It's a license to mint units.

07:04.909 --> 07:09.162
Oh, you've gotta. Once! Maybe twice.

07:11.115 --> 07:13.250
Okay, Lunatik's sensitive about his name.

07:13.251 --> 07:16.086
So just call him Lou. And
don't look him in the eye.

07:16.087 --> 07:18.371
Lunatik: Who you talkin' about, quill?

07:18.372 --> 07:20.290
Oh, hey, Lou.

07:20.291 --> 07:22.959
Buddy. This is...

07:22.960 --> 07:26.379
Looking at me? Nobody looks at me.

07:26.380 --> 07:29.049
I'm the one who looks.

07:32.970 --> 07:35.939
I'm just messin' with you.

07:40.111 --> 07:42.312
Anyway, uh, you remember we talked?

07:42.313 --> 07:43.980
The Pandorian Crystal?

07:43.981 --> 07:46.199
Oh, yeah. Sorry, man.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.285
My lady friend, she wanted it.

07:48.286 --> 07:50.954
Kind of hard to say no to.

07:50.955 --> 07:52.355
Right, babe?

07:55.993 --> 07:57.077
Lucy?

07:57.078 --> 08:00.213
You know her? We dated.

08:00.214 --> 08:02.132
It did not end well.

08:02.133 --> 08:04.167
Neither will this!

08:08.093 --> 08:09.671
Lucy: You lying krutack!

08:09.672 --> 08:13.540
You said you were a prince.
And you never called me!

08:13.541 --> 08:16.543
I thought you were kidding
about dating an A'askavarian.

08:16.544 --> 08:20.631
You left me for this skinny,
green-skinned little flarg?

08:20.632 --> 08:23.600
I am no flarg.

08:26.387 --> 08:28.472
Nobody hits my girl.

08:28.473 --> 08:32.359
Aw, come on, Louie. I need
that crystal, we had a deal.

08:32.360 --> 08:33.727
Lunatik: Deal's off.

08:33.727 --> 08:37.364
I said nobody hurts my girl.

08:37.365 --> 08:39.533
That includes you.

08:39.534 --> 08:41.652
That was before you even met her.

08:45.456 --> 08:49.376
Again, his name is Lunatik.

08:51.663 --> 08:53.413
Bot announcer: <i>That's
gonna leave a mark.</i>

08:53.414 --> 08:55.666
<i>The Masked Pulverizer wins!</i>

08:55.667 --> 08:58.952
<i>Managers, claim your
prize units.</i>

09:00.588 --> 09:02.589
What'd I tell you?

09:02.590 --> 09:05.625
Enough scratch to fix the
ship. Nobody gets hurt.

09:06.644 --> 09:08.345
Mostly.

09:08.346 --> 09:10.264
<i>Crowd seems to like your boy.</i>

09:10.265 --> 09:12.349
<i>Care to keep him in the
ring for another fight?</i>

09:12.350 --> 09:14.601
<i>Double or nothing?</i>

09:14.602 --> 09:17.571
<i>Unless you're afraid.</i>

09:18.656 --> 09:20.524
Audience member: Stakes is high.

09:22.443 --> 09:23.694
We ain't afraid of nothin'!

09:23.695 --> 09:26.613
Dra... uh, Pulverizer! You're going again.

09:26.614 --> 09:28.282
What?

09:43.798 --> 09:45.382
Pretty impressive, huh?

09:45.383 --> 09:47.684
Hang on, I gotta take this.

09:47.685 --> 09:48.769
Hello?

09:48.770 --> 09:51.638
Break it up!

09:51.639 --> 09:54.358
Peter: Corpsman Titus!

09:54.359 --> 09:55.475
Are you following us?

09:55.476 --> 09:57.694
I mean, do you want an
autograph or something?

09:57.695 --> 10:01.648
Let me tell you how your trip
back to Kyln prison is gonna be.

10:01.649 --> 10:04.651
Long and unpleasant.

10:04.652 --> 10:06.653
Lunatik: Yo, cop.

10:06.654 --> 10:08.572
This is my club.

10:08.573 --> 10:13.627
And if I feel like having a
little mosh party with an old pal,

10:13.628 --> 10:17.331
well, what happens on Conjunction...

10:17.332 --> 10:20.634
Don't say it.

10:20.635 --> 10:23.753
I got my eye on you, punks.

10:25.673 --> 10:27.474
Thanks, Lou.

10:27.475 --> 10:29.509
And look, about the
crystal, if we could just...

10:29.510 --> 10:32.346
Yeah. You want the crystal?

10:32.347 --> 10:34.731
Do one thing for me, you can have it.

10:34.732 --> 10:38.769

My ship,

11:49.724 --> 11:51.758
she's beautiful.

11:51.759 --> 11:55.395
I'd forgotten how invigorating
the arena could be.

11:55.396 --> 11:57.814
Yeah!

11:57.815 --> 12:01.685
Okay, down, boy. Our work here is done.

12:01.686 --> 12:03.570
Bot announcer: <i>You've
depleted our account.</i>

12:03.571 --> 12:06.656
<i>But I am authorized
to offer you a wager.</i>

12:06.657 --> 12:10.577
<i>An official Conjunction turbo racer.</i>

<i>It's all yours</i>

<i>If he loses, the

12:19.587 --> 12:23.457
<i>Haven't you always wanted a
ship to call your own? Eh?</i>

12:23.458 --> 12:26.593
<i>That you don't have
to share with anyone?</i>

12:30.465 --> 12:32.466
You got yourself a deal.

12:32.467 --> 12:33.717
<i>You heard it, folks.</i>

12:33.718 --> 12:37.437
<i>The Pulverizer will fight once more!</i>

12:37.438 --> 12:39.473
<i>Against the daughter of Thanos,</i>

12:39.474 --> 12:43.310
<i>the most dangerous
woman in the galaxy.</i>

12:43.311 --> 12:47.364
<i>Gamora!</i>

12:49.734 --> 12:52.569
Drax, what are you doing here?

12:53.404 --> 12:54.621
You knew it was me?

12:54.622 --> 12:56.740
No, I thought it was Rocket.

12:58.543 --> 13:00.460
But I do not resemble Rocket.

13:00.461 --> 13:02.546
Sarcasm. Look into it.

13:02.547 --> 13:04.581
Grandmaster: I did say you two would fight.

13:04.582 --> 13:06.583
The game was getting you here.

13:06.584 --> 13:10.554
Of course, it doesn't hurt to
control everything on Conjunction.

13:10.555 --> 13:15.475
From Club Lunatique to the parts
dealerships, to this very arena.

13:15.476 --> 13:18.345
We won't play your game
anymore, Grandmaster.

13:18.346 --> 13:20.347
Oh, I've already won.

13:20.348 --> 13:22.432
And this is my prize.

13:22.433 --> 13:24.684
I love prizes, don't you?

13:24.685 --> 13:28.555
Yeah! Pound that flarg into the dirt!

13:29.574 --> 13:32.409
She and Quill... dated.

13:32.410 --> 13:34.578
He is braver than I thought.

13:34.579 --> 13:37.947
I told you before, I will not fight her.

13:39.700 --> 13:41.618
I forfeit.

13:41.619 --> 13:43.537
<i>Your fighter forfeits.</i>

13:43.538 --> 13:46.790
<i>So you forfeit your
newly upgraded ship.</i>

13:46.791 --> 13:50.760
Wait. You bet my ship?

13:50.761 --> 13:52.546
My ship?
- Yeah, but...

13:52.547 --> 13:55.599
It's Drax. He's, like, unbeatable.

13:55.600 --> 13:59.719
And you can stick your battle where
your artificial sun don't shine.

13:59.720 --> 14:04.524
Grandmaster: <i>Activate dome
shield. Seal the arena.</i>

14:04.525 --> 14:07.444
Very well. New rule.

14:07.445 --> 14:11.398
You'll fight each other to the death.

14:11.399 --> 14:15.769
Or everyone in this
arena will be vaporized.

14:17.310 --> 14:19.361
Grandmaster: <i>I came to
see the ultimate battle</i>

14:19.362 --> 14:21.313
<i>between Drax and Gamora.</i>

14:21.314 --> 14:23.982
<i>And I will get that battle.</i>

14:23.983 --> 14:27.236
<i>That is, unless you want
to forfeit your lives,</i>

14:27.237 --> 14:30.522
along with everyone else in this arena.

14:32.992 --> 14:34.192
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

14:41.301 --> 14:45.170
Uh, I'm no financial guru, but
isn't vaporizing your customers

14:45.171 --> 14:47.172
gonna eat into your repeat business?

14:47.173 --> 14:49.091
There will always be new customers.

14:49.092 --> 14:51.977
Besides, there's nothing quite like

14:51.978 --> 14:53.178
winning.

14:58.318 --> 15:02.271
Enough, Grandmaster. We will battle.

15:02.272 --> 15:04.072
We are entertainment.

15:04.073 --> 15:07.025
See? Winning!

15:07.026 --> 15:12.030
<i>And now, Gamora. Daughter of Thanos!</i>

15:12.031 --> 15:17.286
<i>Versus Drax the destroyer!</i>

15:17.287 --> 15:20.289
We'll get the ship and take
out that energy-dome-thingy.

15:20.290 --> 15:21.957
Stall for time.

15:21.958 --> 15:24.293
But, you know, you gotta,
like, make it look good.

15:24.294 --> 15:27.496
Oh, I'll make it look real good.

15:36.022 --> 15:38.273
Okay... ideas?

15:38.274 --> 15:39.358
How do we get around this?

15:39.359 --> 15:41.176
Whoa!

15:42.478 --> 15:44.313
Eh, force of habit.

15:44.314 --> 15:46.348
I am Groot.

15:53.156 --> 15:55.457
I am Groot.

15:55.458 --> 15:59.444
Yeah, under works, too.

16:01.998 --> 16:04.166
All right, bud, lead us to my ship.

16:04.167 --> 16:05.334
You mean my ship?

16:05.335 --> 16:07.919
That you gambled away without permission?

16:10.974 --> 16:12.391
You're not even trying to hurt me.

16:12.392 --> 16:15.093
We are just making it look good.

16:18.181 --> 16:20.232
And that gronhak up there
is gonna figure that out.

16:20.233 --> 16:22.100
We need to have a real fight.

16:28.157 --> 16:30.192
Unless maybe you've lost your edge?

16:30.193 --> 16:32.194
Afraid you can't handle me?

16:33.413 --> 16:36.415
I'm Thanos' daughter!

16:36.416 --> 16:40.035
I worked for Ronan.

16:40.036 --> 16:42.254
Tell me you never wondered
if I had something to do

16:42.255 --> 16:44.489
with the destruction of your family!

16:51.047 --> 16:53.382
I didn't, but...

16:53.383 --> 16:55.634
Uh, okay. Dumb move.

17:11.233 --> 17:13.068
Hey, my ship looks great!

17:13.069 --> 17:14.868
Look at all the toys. Groot: I am Groot!

17:20.159 --> 17:22.411
Yeah. One, I paid for those upgrades.

17:22.412 --> 17:25.113
So, again... It's my ship.

17:27.165 --> 17:29.918
Two, if I won that racing ship,

17:29.919 --> 17:31.136
you could have the <i>Milano.</i>

17:31.137 --> 17:33.221
'Cause, you know, I'm nice that way.

17:33.222 --> 17:37.342
And three, Drax was, like, unbeatable.

17:37.343 --> 17:42.097
Okay. One, Drax paid for the ship, not you.

17:42.098 --> 17:45.300
Two, we don't need another ship.

17:47.103 --> 17:49.938
And, three, "like, unbeatable"

17:49.939 --> 17:52.524
is not the same as "unbeatable."

18:00.333 --> 18:02.284
I am Groot.

18:02.285 --> 18:05.287
What do you mean, custom
sizing costs extra?

18:05.288 --> 18:08.123
Ooh, is this real leather?

18:11.210 --> 18:15.046
Peter: The energy dome over the arena is being
projected from the Grandmaster's tower.

18:15.047 --> 18:17.099
We just have to take it out.

18:17.100 --> 18:19.935
Duh, not my first rodeo, slick.

18:23.306 --> 18:25.056
System failures all over the ship.

18:28.027 --> 18:31.313
What's this little gizmo that
looks like a bomb counting down?

18:31.314 --> 18:35.066
Uh, that would be a bomb counting down.

18:35.067 --> 18:37.319
I am Groot. I am Groot. I am Groot!

18:37.320 --> 18:39.321
Rocket: Hey, who's controlling my ship?

18:39.322 --> 18:41.156
Peter: You mean my ship?

18:41.157 --> 18:44.075
Again, I control Conjunction.

18:44.076 --> 18:46.211
I arranged all your upgrades,

18:46.212 --> 18:50.132
and the booby traps, which
means I control your ship.

18:50.133 --> 18:54.052
I've been three steps ahead
of you since you got here.

18:54.053 --> 18:56.087
Stay three steps ahead of this!

19:00.009 --> 19:01.343
What do you think you're doing?

19:01.344 --> 19:04.129
Making my own rules.

19:09.402 --> 19:12.554
Soon as we're over the statue's
head, jettison the bombs.

19:13.272 --> 19:14.356
Roger that.

19:14.357 --> 19:17.075
You're ruining everything.

19:17.076 --> 19:19.310
In three, two, one...

19:27.370 --> 19:31.122
Oh, nobody beats the Grandmaster!

19:39.382 --> 19:42.300
This is Titus. I want
all units on Conjunction

19:42.301 --> 19:44.386
at the arena now.

20:01.370 --> 20:04.372
I propose we postpone this competition.

20:04.373 --> 20:07.209
To protect this undeserving
scum from the angry mob,

20:07.210 --> 20:09.244
or to stave off your own defeat?

20:12.415 --> 20:14.299
Not everything's a competition.

20:14.300 --> 20:17.252
I notice you only say that when you lose.

20:19.138 --> 20:21.423
Be reasonable, I...

20:25.261 --> 20:28.396
This will not stay on Conjunction.

20:28.397 --> 20:31.433
Gamora: Unfortunately, neither will we.

20:43.079 --> 20:47.282
Gamora: Admit it. I could,
would have beaten you.

20:50.419 --> 20:53.204
Think what you like, but no.

20:57.293 --> 21:00.178
I am Groot.

21:00.179 --> 21:01.546
Hey, I'd say we're all winners.

21:01.547 --> 21:04.499
This crystal puts us one step
closer to finding the Cosmic Seed.

21:06.102 --> 21:07.135
What's eating you?

21:07.136 --> 21:10.105
It's not every day you
gotta give up two rides.

21:10.106 --> 21:12.974
Look, I know you've put
in a lot of work on her.

21:12.975 --> 21:15.426
So maybe that makes her a little bit yours.

21:24.153 --> 21:26.354
Nah, you shouldn't have.

21:33.129 --> 21:35.213
Rocket: Hey, how come mine don't recline?
