02:43.990 --> 02:47.500
<b>Japan is way too crowded...</b>

02:48.250 --> 02:53.500
<b>Silva, don't tell me you want to go back home to the patch tribe.</b>

02:54.500 --> 02:55.750
<b>No way, Kalim.</b>

02:56.880 --> 03:00.090
<b>I take great pride in being
one of the ten officiants.</b>

03:01.180 --> 03:04.680
<b>I'll see it through to the end,
until we have a Shaman King.</b>

03:07.390 --> 03:09.480
<b>That's the spirit...</b>

03:10.100 --> 03:11.770
<b>Let's put that thought to the test.</b>

03:12.480 --> 03:14.520
<b>I am the new person in charge of Tao Ren?!</b>

03:15.020 --> 03:18.150
<b>But he's the one who killed Chrom!
He was Silva's best friend.</b>

03:18.180 --> 03:19.710
<b>No matter what you say, that's...</b>

03:19.780 --> 03:21.200
<b>That's exactly why.</b>

03:21.700 --> 03:25.410
<b>I've seen many battles since the preliminaries began...</b>

03:25.530 --> 03:29.120
<b>I've seen the way you favor this Asakura Yoh.</b>

03:30.580 --> 03:33.120
<b>You're right, he's an interesting participant.</b>

03:33.540 --> 03:38.550
<b>But as one of the ten officiants, you have to be impartial.</b>

03:39.090 --> 03:43.090
<b>It may be hard, but that's your job as an officiant.</b>

03:44.090 --> 03:47.760
<b>It's the best way to
show your respect for Chrom.</b>

03:51.390 --> 03:56.690
<b>So this is the place the Great Spirit
has chosen for Yoh-kun's final battlefield.</b>

03:57.400 --> 03:59.610
<b>The day is finally here...</b>

04:00.320 --> 04:01.240
<b>Sure, I guess.</b>

04:01.570 --> 04:06.160
<b>So relaxed! You know if you lose this
match, you're out of the shaman fight!</b>

04:07.530 --> 04:08.740
<b>It's okay, Tamao.</b>

04:09.200 --> 04:13.710
<b>I heard that this boy has
pointy hair and is really scary.</b>

04:14.420 --> 04:17.000
<b>That's why I came all the
way here to root for Yoh-sama.</b>

04:17.590 --> 04:19.750
<b>This is Yoh's battle.</b>

04:20.170 --> 04:22.590
<b>A good woman keeps
quiet and protects the home.</b>

04:24.090 --> 04:26.590
<b>All we can do is have faith that Yoh will win.</b>

04:26.630 --> 04:30.520
<b>And when he comes home we'll
have a nice meal ready for him.</b>

04:33.270 --> 04:35.690
<b>I guess you've arrived.</b>

04:36.060 --> 04:36.980
<b>What?</b>

04:37.150 --> 04:39.940
<b>There's no doubt about it, it's him...</b>

04:49.370 --> 04:53.750
<b>I see, even you can't hide
your tension in front of me.</b>

04:54.160 --> 04:55.420
<b>Asakura Yoh</b>

04:56.170 --> 04:57.710
<b>Well, I can't blame you...</b>

04:58.250 --> 05:03.090
<b>You know firsthand the
power of my Golden Over Soul.</b>

05:04.590 --> 05:08.300
<b>But I won't underestimate
you again, I've seen your power.</b>

05:08.800 --> 05:11.890
<b>You might one day grow to
be a serious obstacle for me.</b>

05:12.680 --> 05:14.150
<b>So I must kill you now...</b>

05:14.230 --> 05:16.560
<b>For I will be the Shaman King!</b>

05:18.690 --> 05:20.400
<b>...Have you gone mad?!</b>

05:21.110 --> 05:25.400
<b>You know, it's just...
This entrance is so "You"</b>

05:25.900 --> 05:27.200

05:29.370 --> 05:31.950
<b>I can't lose any more matches.</b>

05:32.700 --> 05:36.580
<b>I'm sorry, but I have to
win today, no matter what.</b>

05:37.000 --> 05:41.630
<b>Did you just say that
you would defeat me?</b>

05:42.340 --> 05:43.000
<b>Yeah</b>

05:44.840 --> 05:48.300
<b>Does this guy have too
much confidence or stupidity?</b>

05:49.010 --> 05:51.760
<b>He's not just calm...</b>

05:52.330 --> 05:54.220
<b>Something's different about him...</b>

05:54.640 --> 05:55.980
<b>There you are, bastard.</b>

05:56.140 --> 05:58.850
<b>How dare you be so
impudent to the young master!</b>

06:00.810 --> 06:02.320
<b>There you are, Amidamaru!</b>

06:02.480 --> 06:03.780
<b>Stand down, Bason!</b>

06:05.230 --> 06:08.400
<b>Hey, the shaman fight hasn't started yet.</b>

06:08.530 --> 06:09.660
<b>Come back</b>

06:12.030 --> 06:13.740
<b>I just got excited.</b>

06:13.870 --> 06:16.620
<b>That's okay, you were just protecting me.</b>

06:17.040 --> 06:19.750
<b>Thank you, Amidamaru</b>

06:20.330 --> 06:23.290
<b>Again with that idiotic laugh...</b>

06:26.260 --> 06:29.010
<b>You were just a slacker after all.</b>

06:30.010 --> 06:33.680
<b>You are nothing. I don't even
need to use my full powers.</b>

06:33.810 --> 06:36.180
<b>Young master, if you get off White Phoenix...</b>

06:36.350 --> 06:38.730
<b>Shut up loser, I am strong.</b>

06:40.020 --> 06:41.980
<b>I'll finish him with one blow.</b>

06:42.770 --> 06:46.860
<b>Huh? Did you get a little taller
since the last time I saw you?</b>

06:47.740 --> 06:52.620
<b>Of course! I drink 3
glasses of milk every day!</b>

06:54.870 --> 06:56.830
<b>I guess it's time...</b>

06:57.410 --> 06:59.000
<b>Don't be stupid.</b>

06:59.330 --> 07:02.460
<b>That's the countdown to your death.</b>

07:10.260 --> 07:13.640
<b>Bason, integrate in the Bason Blade!</b>

07:16.470 --> 07:18.140
<b>Watch and tremble!</b>

07:18.350 --> 07:21.940
<b>This is my Golden Over Soul!</b>

07:24.440 --> 07:26.480
<b>Golden Chinese Slash Dance!</b>

07:28.360 --> 07:30.240
<b>Ah, you startled me for a second.</b>

07:31.650 --> 07:34.160
<b>You're pretty good!</b>

07:34.700 --> 07:37.790
<b>Is that your new Over Soul?</b>

07:38.790 --> 07:41.330
<b>You seem to have powered up a bit.</b>

07:41.750 --> 07:44.580
<b>Hehe, Thanks for noticing.</b>

07:45.920 --> 07:49.420
<b>Again and again with your stupid answers.</b>

07:50.010 --> 07:51.920
<b>It's starting to piss me off.</b>

07:52.970 --> 07:53.470
<b>But...</b>

07:56.850 --> 07:58.310
<b>Your relaxed attitude...</b>

07:58.890 --> 08:01.930
<b>doesn't work against a king!</b>

08:03.980 --> 08:04.790
<b>Die!</b>

08:06.940 --> 08:09.190
<b>Why didn't he even turn his face?</b>

08:09.940 --> 08:12.780
<b>It's because Yoh-dono can
see through my eyes too!</b>

08:13.320 --> 08:14.950
<b>This guy...</b>

08:15.990 --> 08:19.040
<b>This is how I use my Over Soul.</b>

08:20.910 --> 08:21.660
<b>Amidaryu...</b>

08:23.710 --> 08:25.460
<b>Shockwave Buddhagiri!</b>

08:28.190 --> 08:31.070
<b>Could it be that that Ren guy has lost?</b>

08:32.760 --> 08:35.720
<b>No, he's powerful. that's why...</b>

08:36.640 --> 08:37.930
<b>He's unscathed.</b>

08:38.050 --> 08:40.510
<b>In fact, he's pointier than ever!</b>

08:40.640 --> 08:41.720
<b>Of course.</b>

08:42.020 --> 08:45.350
<b>I live to destroy everything!</b>

08:46.770 --> 08:48.650
<b>Yoh-dono...
Ren's Furyoku...</b>

08:49.230 --> 08:53.440
<b>It's because he was only
using a little Furyoku before.</b>

08:53.990 --> 08:55.780
<b>But now he's getting serious.</b>

08:56.660 --> 08:59.490
<b>So that's how Ren's Over
Soul looks when he's serious.</b>

09:00.120 --> 09:01.370
<b>That's not all.</b>

09:01.910 --> 09:04.160
<b>He pumped more Furyoku into it.</b>

09:04.620 --> 09:05.500
<b>Pumped?</b>

09:20.810 --> 09:23.770
<b>Did you think my attack was over?</b>

09:28.190 --> 09:29.320
<b>Take this!</b>

09:29.340 --> 09:31.770
<b>Bason Golden Punch!</b>

09:34.610 --> 09:37.820
<b>This is how you wield a materialized ghost!</b>

09:38.450 --> 09:42.030
<b>Lament your stupidity in death!</b>

09:50.670 --> 09:53.630
<b>He used his Over Soul as a cushion...</b>

09:57.720 --> 10:00.220
<b>And what's wrong with that?</b>

10:01.300 --> 10:04.060
<b>I'm not good at high places...</b>

10:05.270 --> 10:07.060
<b>I was just a little surprised is all!</b>

10:08.310 --> 10:10.610
<b>An Over Soul is made using Furyoku...</b>

10:11.300 --> 10:14.980
<b>When it is destroyed and recreated,
the Shaman will lose some Furyoku.</b>

10:15.640 --> 10:17.950
<b>The Furyoku value is on the Oracle Bell...</b>

10:18.360 --> 10:21.570
<b>Yoh-kun's level has dropped from 270 to 240..</b>

10:22.580 --> 10:24.450
<b>And Ren still has 350.</b>

10:24.990 --> 10:25.830
<b>Meaning?</b>

10:26.750 --> 10:30.650
<b>Unless he can create an Over Soul stronger
than Ren with his remaining Furyoku...</b>

10:31.710 --> 10:33.500
<b>Yoh-kun has no chance of winning...</b>

10:34.670 --> 10:38.300
<b>You have finally lost
your cool, that's good.</b>

10:38.550 --> 10:41.260
<b>You will die by my hand!</b>

10:46.430 --> 10:52.690
<b>Oh yeah, there's Anna-san! She
might know how to reverse this situation.</b>

10:53.230 --> 10:54.400
<b>Manta?!</b>

10:55.110 --> 10:57.780
<b>Hehehe, did he go call for help?</b>

10:58.150 --> 11:00.650
<b>That's pitiful, Asakura Yoh!</b>

11:05.370 --> 11:06.990
<b>Are you okay?</b>

11:07.120 --> 11:08.910
<b>Yeah, I'll manage.</b>

11:09.460 --> 11:13.040
<b>But at this rate...
Is there nothing we can do?</b>

11:13.250 --> 11:14.340
<b>There is.</b>

11:15.320 --> 11:19.650
<b>He's pumped a huge amount of Furyoku into
his Over Soul to make it big and strong.</b>

11:20.840 --> 11:25.470
<b>So I just have to make an
Over Soul that's even bigger.</b>

11:26.060 --> 11:29.140
<b>As expected from Yoh-dono! Now let's...</b>

11:29.270 --> 11:30.520
<b>Nope.</b>

11:31.020 --> 11:34.310
<b>It's exhausting.
I think I'll stay the way I am.</b>

11:34.650 --> 11:36.610
<b>Now is not the time for...</b>

11:37.230 --> 11:41.490
<b>Just how do you pump more Furyoku into an Over Soul?</b>

11:41.630 --> 11:43.070
<b>I don't really know how.</b>

11:44.330 --> 11:47.600
<b>Hahahaha, that's rich!</b>

11:49.120 --> 11:50.410
<b>Samurai!</b>

11:51.080 --> 11:53.250
<b>Yoh-dono! Is that true?!</b>

11:53.750 --> 11:57.920
<b>It's not impossible if I tried really hard.</b>

11:58.130 --> 11:59.300
<b>Then why?</b>

11:59.670 --> 12:02.760
<b>Remember the reason I lost to Faust that day?</b>

12:03.050 --> 12:05.100
<b>It's because I pushed myself too much.</b>

12:05.760 --> 12:09.600
<b>I can't do it because it makes me
feel like I can't be myself. I hate it.</b>

12:10.560 --> 12:12.980
<b>It’s really scary to lose sight of yourself</b>

12:13.810 --> 12:17.400
<b>You feel confused, you
don't know what's right.</b>

12:17.860 --> 12:19.650
<b>I didn't understand it at first.</b>

12:22.360 --> 12:28.080
<b>In the cavern of the dead, I learned how
important and hard it is to be yourself.</b>

12:29.490 --> 12:32.330
<b>So I'm not going to do
something that isn't me.</b>

12:33.460 --> 12:34.920
<b>I will believe in you, Amidamaru...</b>

12:35.170 --> 12:37.840
<b>And do what we have to do here.</b>

12:40.090 --> 12:41.090
<b>Yoh-dono...</b>

12:41.880 --> 12:45.590
<b>What do you mean you
don't want to push yourself?</b>

12:45.890 --> 12:49.260
<b>That's the idiocy of the
people that don't fight!</b>

12:50.220 --> 12:51.560
<b>Now die!</b>

12:51.680 --> 12:54.690
<b>Bason Golden Double Sledgehammer!</b>

13:08.780 --> 13:10.880
<b>I don't believe it...</b>

13:11.120 --> 13:16.170
<b>Your puny Over Soul
punctured my golden colossus?</b>

13:17.250 --> 13:19.080
<b>It was a fluke!</b>

13:22.210 --> 13:25.840
<b>Yoh-dono, forward and to the right!
Dive under him!</b>

13:29.260 --> 13:30.890
<b>Bason, behind us!</b>

13:31.640 --> 13:33.850
<b>Take a step back, then
leap back even further!</b>

13:38.230 --> 13:42.190
<b>Go! Super Golden Chinese Slash Dance!</b>

13:44.490 --> 13:46.070
<b>That should finish you!</b>

13:46.320 --> 13:47.950
<b>I'm over here.</b>

13:49.950 --> 13:52.280
<b>Impossible, how did you do that?!</b>

13:52.580 --> 13:53.990
<b>You bastard!</b>

13:55.700 --> 13:56.580
<b>Amidaryu...</b>

13:58.620 --> 13:59.880
<b>Halo blade!</b>

14:06.670 --> 14:09.260
<b>How... what's going on?</b>

14:10.430 --> 14:11.510
<b>Answer me!</b>

14:11.720 --> 14:16.020
<b>No one can escape from my
Super Golden Chinese slash dance!</b>

14:16.390 --> 14:18.350
<b>How did you do it?!</b>

14:18.980 --> 14:22.110
<b>No, I didn't evade it.</b>

14:23.860 --> 14:26.110
<b>You hit me four times with that one.</b>

14:28.110 --> 14:29.450
<b>So that's how...</b>

14:30.160 --> 14:32.870
<b>The Over soul is a spiritual construction.</b>

14:33.740 --> 14:36.550
<b>So, no matter how much
Furyoku gets pumped into it...</b>

14:36.620 --> 14:39.120
<b>If the spirit of the wielder falters...</b>

14:39.750 --> 14:41.460
<b>The Over Soul will fail.</b>

14:42.670 --> 14:46.040
<b>Ren's confidence comes from
the huge quantity of Furyoku he has.</b>

14:46.550 --> 14:51.840
<b>But Yoh-kun has kept calm even
though his Furyoku has diminished...</b>

14:52.430 --> 14:55.060
<b>And that has shaken
Ren's confidence to the core.</b>

14:56.600 --> 15:03.060
<b>Because of that, his invincible Over Soul
was shattered along with his confidence.</b>

15:03.730 --> 15:05.020
<b>So that's how...</b>

15:05.440 --> 15:08.110
<b>So this battle will be decided by...</b>

15:08.650 --> 15:10.200
<b>an unwavering heart.</b>

15:13.410 --> 15:16.620
<b>Why are they all dead?</b>

15:17.450 --> 15:21.330
<b>Why do you kill everyone?</b>

15:22.000 --> 15:26.750
<b>Why are you so rotten?</b>

15:28.840 --> 15:31.090
<b>You've become a nuisance...</b>

15:33.300 --> 15:36.140
<b>I have a cause...</b>

15:37.390 --> 15:39.810
<b>To fail would be unthinkable...</b>

15:40.180 --> 15:42.810
<b>I must prevail!</b>

15:44.980 --> 15:46.610
<b>Come White Phoenix!</b>

15:49.530 --> 15:55.030
<b>Now it's time to show
you my final trump card!</b>

16:09.300 --> 16:14.590
<b>This time I'm going to show
you what I'm really made of!</b>

16:16.350 --> 16:18.810
<b>My shaman horse, White Phoenix...</b>

16:19.010 --> 16:22.640
<b>And the finest steed in all of history!</b>

16:23.480 --> 16:25.060
<b>Come out, Black Peach!</b>

16:27.770 --> 16:31.110
<b>Integrate in White Phoenix!</b>

16:34.610 --> 16:37.700
<b>Bason, Maximum Over Soul!</b>

16:39.030 --> 16:43.500
<b>Black Peach is the ghost of the steed that
Bason rode on the battlefields long ago!</b>

16:44.250 --> 16:46.960
<b>His ears can detect any lurking foe...</b>

16:47.210 --> 16:49.960
<b>His eyes can detect any attack...</b>

16:50.170 --> 16:53.880
<b>And his mighty legs hurl
him upon his enemies...</b>

16:54.430 --> 16:57.390
<b>On Black Peach's back, Bason is invincible!</b>

16:57.890 --> 17:01.310
<b>His power is far beyond
that of one measly samurai!</b>

17:09.440 --> 17:10.320
<b>What, really?!</b>

17:11.190 --> 17:14.570
<b>That pointy jerk is using two ghosts! That's not fair!</b>

17:14.860 --> 17:16.660
<b>Of course it is fair.</b>

17:17.910 --> 17:19.950
<b>The more ghosts one uses...</b>

17:20.280 --> 17:21.870
<b>the more Furyoku one expends.</b>

17:22.290 --> 17:25.660
<b>The ability to use Furyoku to it's fullest effects...</b>

17:26.420 --> 17:29.040
<b>Is the very essence of the shaman fight.</b>

17:30.090 --> 17:31.090
<b>Who are you?</b>

17:31.630 --> 17:33.380
<b>Look, Eliza.</b>

17:33.960 --> 17:37.300
<b>I care little about who will win...</b>

17:38.050 --> 17:41.600
<b>In fact, I wish they would both die.</b>

17:44.180 --> 17:45.100
<b>Creepy!</b>

17:46.350 --> 17:49.020
<b>Yoh-kun has 90 Furyoku units left.</b>

17:49.520 --> 17:50.900
<b>Ren has 150.</b>

17:52.270 --> 17:54.490
<b>The match will be decided by the next blow.</b>

17:55.900 --> 17:57.280
<b>Victory will be mine.</b>

17:58.490 --> 18:00.950
<b>I have reason for having to win this match.</b>

18:01.370 --> 18:06.120
<b>Your goals and duties are
inconsequential compared to mine!</b>

18:06.540 --> 18:07.830
<b>What do you mean?</b>

18:08.210 --> 18:10.040
<b>You would never understand...</b>

18:10.540 --> 18:13.090
<b>How do you know that if you don't tell me?</b>

18:13.500 --> 18:20.760
<b>With your fluff brain, you could
never understand how I feel.</b>

18:24.060 --> 18:26.180
<b>He's such a tragic child.</b>

18:27.270 --> 18:28.690
<b>So please...</b>

18:29.270 --> 18:31.360
<b>Please let Ren be free...</b>

18:31.940 --> 18:34.730
<b>Huh, what are you talking about?</b>

18:35.030 --> 18:37.860
<b>Father, can't you see that he's suffering?</b>

18:38.700 --> 18:43.490
<b>The Tao family have slaughtered multitudes
in name of restoration and revenge.</b>

18:44.330 --> 18:47.790
<b>The truth is... There's a gentle soul within him.</b>

18:48.330 --> 18:50.460
<b>He doesn't know how to make the pain stop...</b>

18:50.790 --> 18:53.880
<b>He carries it all within himself.</b>

18:56.460 --> 18:59.090
<b>He's seen too much bloodshed...</b>

19:00.680 --> 19:02.850
<b>Father, he will lose...</b>

19:03.350 --> 19:04.850
<b>Ren will lose?!</b>

19:05.930 --> 19:07.220
<b>How can that be?!</b>

19:08.480 --> 19:09.430
<b>Answer me, Jun!</b>

19:11.020 --> 19:14.270
<b>Because his opponent is Asakura Yoh...</b>

19:16.500 --> 19:17.880
<b>Go!</b>

19:18.110 --> 19:18.610
<b>Yoh-dono!</b>

19:19.320 --> 19:22.950
<b>Hmm... I can't block it...
And I can't evade it either.</b>

19:23.410 --> 19:25.620
<b>Then there's only one thing I can do.</b>

19:26.160 --> 19:27.870
<b>Wha? What is...?</b>

19:29.040 --> 19:31.080
<b>I've got to go head to head with Ren!</b>

19:32.790 --> 19:35.000
<b>Asakura Yoh is a strange boy.</b>

19:35.790 --> 19:40.130
<b>He worried about Pyron
and me, even as he fought us.</b>

19:41.050 --> 19:42.590
<b>But I sensed something in him...</b>

19:43.590 --> 19:47.260
<b>A sadness, just like ours...</b>

19:47.720 --> 19:51.310
<b>And a warmth such as
I have never felt before.</b>

19:52.810 --> 19:55.770
<b>Ren doesn't have that gift,
he only know how to destroy.</b>

19:56.770 --> 20:04.110
<b>Ren is obsessed with him because he sensed a
power in Asakura Yoh that contrasts with his own.</b>

20:04.950 --> 20:07.830
<b>It is the power to create something out of nothing</b>

20:08.700 --> 20:10.370
<b>From nothing?</b>

20:11.330 --> 20:15.960
<b>Ren thinks he can numb his own
sadness by destroying everything...</b>

20:17.570 --> 20:20.790
<b>But only one thing can neutralize
so much negative energy...</b>

20:21.420 --> 20:23.010
<b>Infinite warmth...</b>

20:23.340 --> 20:26.220
<b>The power to create something from nothing.</b>

20:26.390 --> 20:27.760
<b>Hahahaha!</b>

20:28.060 --> 20:30.770
<b>You want to go head to head with me?!</b>

20:31.520 --> 20:33.350
<b>Are you out of your mind?</b>

20:34.020 --> 20:36.190
<b>It's impossible!</b>

20:37.020 --> 20:39.230
<b>Come on, I'll destroy you too!</b>

20:39.440 --> 20:42.690
<b>Bason plus Black Peach in White Phoenix...</b>

20:43.360 --> 20:46.620
<b>Perfect Reenactment of the Chinese Slash Dance!</b>

20:48.240 --> 20:51.700
<b>I told you, I don't overreach...</b>

20:52.830 --> 20:54.790
<b>So it's not impossible...</b>

20:57.170 --> 20:59.710
<b>So what?!</b>

21:12.680 --> 21:14.560
<b>What's going on with this match...?</b>

21:28.200 --> 21:31.330
<b>So it was my loss after all...</b>

21:32.450 --> 21:35.460
<b>I knew it from the start...</b>

21:37.540 --> 21:41.000
<b>From the day I first met him...</b>

21:41.800 --> 21:43.880
<b>I knew I couldn't beat him...</b>

21:46.130 --> 21:49.680
<b>He's like wind and water...</b>

21:50.300 --> 21:53.970
<b>All I can do is crush my opponents with force.</b>

21:54.470 --> 21:57.890
<b>I kept telling myself strength could prevail...</b>

21:58.400 --> 22:00.400
<b>But now I finally understand.</b>

22:01.110 --> 22:04.990
<b>Brute force cannot crush wind or water.</b>

22:05.900 --> 22:08.910
<b>It actually feels good to be out of Furyoku.</b>

22:09.030 --> 22:10.660
<b>It's kind of refreshing.</b>

22:12.080 --> 22:13.290
<b>Asakura Yoh.</b>

22:13.700 --> 22:15.910
<b>I hate to admit it,  but you win.</b>

22:17.660 --> 22:19.170
<b>Hold on, Ren.</b>

22:19.880 --> 22:22.170
<b>Actually, I'm out of Furyoku too...</b>

22:22.380 --> 22:23.420
<b>What will I do now?!</b>

22:23.550 --> 22:26.300
<b>If I lose, Anna will kill me!</b>

22:26.510 --> 22:27.340
<b>Help me!</b>

22:29.090 --> 22:31.010
<b>What the hell?</b>

22:31.510 --> 22:34.220
<b>Then how are we supposed to know who's won?!</b>

22:34.390 --> 22:37.140
<b>You should've been watching more carefully!</b>

22:37.270 --> 22:39.810
<b>Instead you were trying to look cool!</b>

22:39.940 --> 22:41.440
<b>What did you say, you bastard?!</b>

22:41.560 --> 22:43.360
<b>Say it!</b>

22:43.610 --> 22:45.730
<b>You're bickering like old friends.</b>

22:46.650 --> 22:48.900
<b>I was watching the match.</b>

22:49.150 --> 22:49.860
<b>Silva!</b>

22:50.660 --> 22:53.280
<b>You both ran out of Furyoku at the same time.</b>

22:53.910 --> 22:55.830
<b>Therefore, this match is a draw.</b>

22:57.950 --> 22:59.000
<b>Draw?</b>

22:59.210 --> 23:01.710
<b>Hey bastard, how can it be a draw?</b>

23:01.830 --> 23:03.840
<b>Only one of us can go on!</b>

23:04.340 --> 23:05.750
<b>Calm down.</b>

23:06.250 --> 23:08.470
<b>Yoh-kun has 1 win, 1 loss and 1 draw</b>

23:08.800 --> 23:10.590
<b>Ren has 1 win and 1 draw</b>

23:11.340 --> 23:13.430
<b>But this is the last of the preliminaries...</b>

23:13.950 --> 23:18.470
<b>We'll have to turn to the great spirit for
this one, there's nothing else we can do.</b>

23:21.140 --> 23:22.980
<b>Well, Goldva-sama?</b>

23:23.900 --> 23:27.030
<b>Yeah, I just got a response.</b>

23:27.570 --> 23:30.820
<b>They will both go on to the Shaman Fight.</b>

23:32.280 --> 23:37.080
<b>I'm sure that decision was made
because you two have great potential.</b>

23:37.870 --> 23:40.000
<b>Now then, since everyone's here...</b>

23:41.290 --> 23:44.040
<b>Let the opening ceremony begin!</b>

23:46.740 --> 23:50.900
<b>Flame Night</b>

23:46.740 --> 23:50.900
<b>Flame Night</b>

23:47.630 --> 23:49.670
<b>Next time "Night in the Flame"</b>
