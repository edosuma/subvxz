how proud of you I am

04:37.736 --> 04:38.946
for putting together

04:37.736 --> 04:38.946
this fundraiser

04:46.494 --> 04:48.122
Sorry, sweetie.

04:56.046 --> 04:57.881
Now, Joey, you're

04:56.046 --> 04:57.881
going to open the show

04:57.923 --> 04:59.174
by doing your comedy act.

04:59.216 --> 05:01.718
Deej, I've totally

04:59.216 --> 05:01.718
adapted my Vegas act

05:01.760 --> 05:03.804
to the junior

05:01.760 --> 05:03.804
high school crowd.

05:03.845 --> 05:06.681
So this seventh grader

05:03.845 --> 05:06.681
comes up to me and says

05:06.723 --> 05:08.892
"Hey, dude,

05:06.723 --> 05:08.892
got any mousse?"

05:08.934 --> 05:12.437
And I said, "Why, certainly,

05:08.934 --> 05:12.437
is Bullwinkle okay?"

05:14.982 --> 05:18.277
So when I was in junior high

05:14.982 --> 05:18.277
I watched lots of cartoons.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.821
Did you notice that cartoon

05:18.318 --> 05:20.821

05:20.862 --> 05:23.448
whenever they needed it?

05:23.490 --> 05:25.826
And it wasn't the type of

05:23.490 --> 05:25.826
dynamite that would kill you.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.328
It just kinda made

05:25.867 --> 05:28.328
your rear end smolder.

05:29.913 --> 05:33.374
Joey, that's great. My friends

05:29.913 --> 05:33.374
think you're hilarious.

05:33.416 --> 05:36.003

05:33.416 --> 05:36.003

05:36.044 --> 05:39.298

05:36.044 --> 05:39.298
tear it apart, party till the..

05:39.338 --> 05:40.841

05:39.338 --> 05:40.841

05:44.886 --> 05:46.596
when you're up there

05:46.638 --> 05:47.973
introducing Jesse and Joey..

05:48.015 --> 05:49.808
- Yeah, Deej?

05:48.015 --> 05:49.808
- Keep it short.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.853

05:49.850 --> 05:52.853

05:56.690 --> 06:00.110

05:56.690 --> 06:00.110
mention my tushy in public.

06:01.444 --> 06:02.988
I'm going over to Kimmy's.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.405

- Bye.

Jess, I gotta tell you, man,

08:34.514 --> 08:36.891
I know why you rockers

08:36.933 --> 08:38.601
wiggle around

08:36.933 --> 08:38.601
on the stage so much.

08:38.643 --> 08:41.146
These leather pants

08:38.643 --> 08:41.146

08:43.023 --> 08:45.566

my song before D.J. gets home.

08:51.365 --> 08:52.949
Alright.

08:56.744 --> 09:00.457
been my secret dream

09:00.499 --> 09:02.376
to be a real rock star.

...I never told you

09:06.004 --> 09:08.006
this, but, uh

09:08.048 --> 09:10.050
I used to sing with

09:08.048 --> 09:10.050
the Partridge Family.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.636
- You did?

09:12.010 --> 09:13.636

09:19.142 --> 09:21.228
that's ultra

09:19.142 --> 09:21.228
hip and mega cool.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.146
"My Generation" by The Who.

09:23.188 --> 09:26.691
Well, "My Generation" was ultra

09:23.188 --> 09:26.691
hip and mega cool in the '60s

09:26.733 --> 09:28.693
but these kids

09:26.733 --> 09:28.693
won't know that song.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.779
Hey, "My Generation"

09:28.735 --> 09:31.779
is a timeless anthem

09:31.821 --> 09:34.032
of teenage angst

09:31.821 --> 09:34.032
and rebellion.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.201
But I'm not gonna sing it like

09:34.074 --> 09:36.201
some old rock and roll dinosaur.
