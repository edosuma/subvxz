WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:05.422
I think maybe we should talk about
the specificity of the Me Too movements.

00:02.085 --> 00:03.170
 X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=M
PEGTS-,

00:05.506 --> 00:10.469
There was the first wave of guys
who were accused,

00:10.552 --> 00:12.137
and then there was the second wave,

00:12.638 --> 00:15.224
and we could talk about the nuance
between the two.

00:15.682 --> 00:16.683
I don't think I follow.

00:16.767 --> 00:20.896
Well, the first wave was... really bad.

00:21.480 --> 00:24.525
And then the guys accused
in the second wave was just different.

00:25.192 --> 00:26.902
Spell it out for me, won't you, Mitch?

00:27.903 --> 00:30.113
Well, you are actually a predator.

00:30.572 --> 00:33.992
As opposed to...
What are you exactly, Mitch?
ï»¿1

01:15.214 --> 01:16.215
Not you.

02:40.215 --> 02:41.425
Here's your coffee.

02:43.385 --> 02:44.386
Thanks.

02:46.472 --> 02:48.641
Two more days of being 49.

02:49.725 --> 02:50.976
Enjoy.

02:51.894 --> 02:52.895
Yep.

03:44.822 --> 03:48.701
Paul, Paul, Paul, what are you doing
here in the middle of the fuckin' night?

03:48.784 --> 03:51.286
- I don't know. Just couldn't sleep.
- I get it.

03:52.705 --> 03:55.666
And, hey, happy early birthday
since I won't be seeing you Sunday.

03:55.749 --> 03:58.210
Thank you,
but I'd rather forget about this one.

04:05.926 --> 04:07.386
It's from Alex.

04:09.138 --> 04:12.099
Same stupid song she sends me every year.

04:13.767 --> 04:14.935
Let's do it, boss.

04:21.025 --> 04:22.693
She is such an idiot.

04:23.652 --> 04:24.945
I love this song.

04:27.448 --> 04:31.535
<i>Happy, happy birthday, baby</i>

04:34.872 --> 04:38.542
<i>Although you're with somebody new</i>

04:42.296 --> 04:46.175
<i>Thought I'd drop a line to say</i>

04:46.425 --> 04:49.887
<i>That I wish this happy day</i>

04:49.970 --> 04:54.975
<i>Would find me beside you</i>

04:56.559 --> 04:59.188
And Chip's wondering
if you'll reach out to J.Lo,

04:59.271 --> 05:02.107
see if she's interested in talking
about the situation in Puerto Rico.

05:02.191 --> 05:04.485
- Sure. Of course.
- I'll set that up this evening.

05:04.568 --> 05:07.029
Questions for the education
reform debate Tuesday.

05:07.112 --> 05:08.489
Wait, Tuesday?

05:09.531 --> 05:12.242
That's the same day
as the wild card game. I'm doing that.

05:12.951 --> 05:14.453
Yeah, that's what I thought.

05:15.079 --> 05:16.664
I'll talk to Chip about it.

05:23.420 --> 05:24.463
Hey, hey, hey!

05:24.546 --> 05:26.674
- Happy birthday weekend, Big Daddy!
- Okay!

05:26.757 --> 05:28.175
Thank you. Thank you.

05:28.258 --> 05:30.594
- Happy birthday!
- Hi!

05:32.012 --> 05:33.472
- Hey, happy birthday, man.
- Jake!

05:33.889 --> 05:34.974
Man of the hour.

05:35.057 --> 05:37.935
- Don't shortchange me there, Daniel. Hey!
- There he is!

05:38.519 --> 05:39.979
- Man of the year.
- There you go.

05:40.062 --> 05:41.063
- Hey!
- Happy birthday.

05:41.146 --> 05:43.190
Thank you. What do we have?
What do we have?

05:44.608 --> 05:46.443
"Power's yet to be restored in Puerto Rico

05:46.527 --> 05:49.196
following the devastation
of Hurricane Maria"?

05:50.322 --> 05:51.323
Thank you.

05:51.407 --> 05:53.367
The perfect gift for the woman
who has everything.

05:53.826 --> 05:55.285
How old does this make you?

05:56.245 --> 05:59.456
Well, if this were <i>Logan's Run</i>,
they would've killed me 20 years ago.

06:00.833 --> 06:01.875
Help me out?

06:02.418 --> 06:04.086
Old enough to have seen <i>Logan's Run</i>.

06:04.169 --> 06:05.254
Hey.

06:07.297 --> 06:08.424
Hey.

06:09.466 --> 06:10.467
Happy birthday.

06:10.551 --> 06:11.719
Thanks, not till Sunday.

06:11.802 --> 06:12.928
- Oh, yeah.
- But thank you.

06:14.179 --> 06:16.765
<i>- Happy birthday to you...</i>
- Thank you.

06:18.267 --> 06:20.436
You got the Hurricane Maria copy there?

06:20.519 --> 06:21.770
- I do.
- Okay.

06:22.604 --> 06:23.939
- See you in a bit.
- All right.

06:24.023 --> 06:27.026
- Hey!
- Hey! It's the fuckin' birthday boy!

06:37.077 --> 06:38.329
What's that spot?

06:39.455 --> 06:41.999
That's just a finger smudge. My bad.

06:42.082 --> 06:43.459
Oh, my gosh. There it is.

06:44.251 --> 06:46.920
Wow! It's here.

06:47.546 --> 06:49.441
Thanks, man.
Appreciate you bringing it this early.

06:49.465 --> 06:52.718
- Hey, thanks. Wow.
- That's why they call it a crotch rocket.

06:52.801 --> 06:55.804
Oh, my God. Mitch is gonna love this.

06:55.888 --> 06:58.390
- Which is so lame.
- I agree.

06:58.849 --> 07:01.644
Chip, we have a scheduling conflict here.

07:01.727 --> 07:04.104
You have me doing
the education reform debate.

07:04.188 --> 07:06.523
And it's the same day
as the wild card game.

07:07.149 --> 07:09.902
- Yes, about that.
- Yes.

07:09.985 --> 07:11.820
Mitch is gonna cover it.

07:13.447 --> 07:14.948
What? Why?

07:15.574 --> 07:18.911
It's not a big deal. The network
just wants to try Mitch on the playoffs.

07:20.287 --> 07:22.414
But I do the playoffs.

07:22.706 --> 07:24.750
Yeah, but I think they just wanna try it.

07:24.833 --> 07:27.273
<i>YDA's</i> closing the gap.
They're just throwing shit at the wall,

07:27.336 --> 07:29.064
see if they can get more eyeballs
in the morning.

07:29.088 --> 07:30.798
You'll be back on it next year. It's fine.

07:31.215 --> 07:35.678
Chip, people expect to see me in
the studio after the game as a tradition.

07:36.095 --> 07:38.722
Isn't that what baseball's all about?
Tradition?

07:39.139 --> 07:41.266
It's a museum masquerading as a sport?

07:41.600 --> 07:43.811
Look, I'm on your side, okay? It's just...

07:43.894 --> 07:46.605
The network gets a little nervous,
and they did a test.

07:48.899 --> 07:49.900
What?

07:50.859 --> 07:52.111
A test?

07:52.528 --> 07:54.113
The network did a test?

07:55.990 --> 08:01.620
I see. So they pay people 50 bucks to
come in for a ten-cent opinion.

08:01.704 --> 08:03.956
Exactly.
It's stupid, and it's random, okay?

08:04.039 --> 08:07.459
It's just that Mitch happened to
test very well.

08:07.543 --> 08:11.255
Mitch tests really well
when he tests with me. Okay?

08:11.338 --> 08:13.018
- I agree.
- Did they test him with Alison?

08:13.048 --> 08:15.777
Because that's when they should've
tested him, when I was away last month.

08:15.801 --> 08:20.222
Because this party of one,
this focus group, saw it and it sucked.

08:20.306 --> 08:21.682
Look, they're gonna do more tests.

08:21.765 --> 08:24.643
The cream is gonna rise to the top.
You are gonna be fine. Relax.

08:24.727 --> 08:28.272
Oh, my God.
Chip, you used to be my producer.

08:28.731 --> 08:32.818
Don't pull that shit on...
I am still your producer, okay?

08:32.901 --> 08:37.156
I found you. Hello. I found you.

08:37.781 --> 08:39.700
And now you've found your golden goose?

08:40.117 --> 08:42.036
No, you are my golden goose.

08:42.119 --> 08:45.456
It's just that, technically,
I have two golden geese.

08:46.332 --> 08:50.502
But now Mitch has you and Fred
and Reid in his side pocket.

08:50.586 --> 08:52.212
And I know what you guys do.

08:52.296 --> 08:55.341
You hang out, you talk about girls.

08:55.424 --> 08:57.718
You smoke cigars, you play golf.

08:57.801 --> 09:01.388
You give Mitch more good stories,
then more people love Mitch.

09:01.472 --> 09:04.075
The more people that love Mitch,
the better he's gonna test. Come on.

09:04.099 --> 09:06.977
I get this. I'm not an idiot.

09:07.394 --> 09:08.479
It's not that complicated.

09:08.562 --> 09:09.563
- I know.
- Come on.

09:09.647 --> 09:10.832
- What?
- Makeup's ready for you.

09:10.856 --> 09:13.483
All right. Thank you.
I'm not done with this conversation.

09:13.567 --> 09:14.943
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay?

09:15.026 --> 09:16.153
- Seriously?
- What?

09:16.236 --> 09:17.404
Don't worry.

09:18.572 --> 09:19.990
Do I look worried?

09:20.406 --> 09:22.493
Worried. Jesus.

09:26.830 --> 09:28.058
- Coffee for you.
- Claire, right?

09:28.082 --> 09:29.083
- Yes.
- Okay.

09:29.166 --> 09:31.502
- And one of these is yours.
- Yes, thank you.

09:31.919 --> 09:34.922
- And, Lay... Layla...
- Thanks. I'll be fine with that.

09:35.005 --> 09:36.090
Okay.

09:37.341 --> 09:38.717
- Lindsey...
- Yes, hi.

09:38.801 --> 09:40.260
- Take that.
- Thank you, Carla.

09:40.344 --> 09:42.554
- And...
- It's Claire, but...

09:42.972 --> 09:44.473
And Donny. Donny...

09:44.556 --> 09:46.767
Oh, Donny! That's yours.

09:48.560 --> 09:50.187
And Jared...

09:53.232 --> 09:54.775
- Coffee.
- Thanks.

09:55.651 --> 09:57.611
Sorry to bother you, but who is Jared?

09:57.695 --> 09:59.655
Sorry, there are just so many names
to learn here.

09:59.738 --> 10:01.657
I'm Jared. Head booker. Learn my name.

10:02.282 --> 10:03.283
Sorry.

10:03.701 --> 10:06.495
- Don't take it personally. He's just...
- An asshole?

10:06.578 --> 10:07.579
Well, yeah.

10:07.663 --> 10:09.289
Sorry he's your direct superior.

10:09.707 --> 10:12.084
It's all a learning experience.

10:12.167 --> 10:14.253
But I have my goals I'm here to achieve,

10:14.336 --> 10:17.297
so I just figure
I'll use every part of the buffalo,

10:17.381 --> 10:18.382
even the asshole.

10:18.799 --> 10:19.800
- Claire?
- Yes.

10:19.883 --> 10:22.529
Go make sure Alison's dress showed up
for the birthday segment, would you?

10:22.553 --> 10:23.595
- Will do.
- Thank you.

10:23.679 --> 10:25.097
Thank you for being human.

10:26.598 --> 10:27.975
- Hey, Jared. Come here.
- Yeah.

10:28.058 --> 10:29.286
- What's up?
- What the fuck, dude?

10:29.310 --> 10:30.954
What do you mean "what the fuck"?
What's going on?

10:30.978 --> 10:33.618
Why is Alex talking to Owen Gorman
for the Homeland Security story?

10:33.689 --> 10:35.959
You asked me to find someone
to cover the confirmation hearing.

10:35.983 --> 10:38.193
No, I asked you to find a senator
to cover the hearing.

10:38.277 --> 10:40.213
Someone who is,
I don't know, in the actual Senate.

10:40.237 --> 10:41.238
Here you go. Thank you.

10:41.322 --> 10:43.508
As you know, Gorman is a member
of the House of Representatives.

10:43.532 --> 10:45.468
We do not care about
the opinion of Florida's second district.

10:45.492 --> 10:46.618
Gorman is great TV.

10:46.702 --> 10:47.995
Gorman's an attention whore.

10:48.078 --> 10:50.164
He's also an attention whore
that you book biweekly.

10:50.247 --> 10:52.833
So from now on,
there is a moratorium on booking Gorman,

10:52.916 --> 10:54.894
unless there's a fucking atomic bomb
in Tallahassee.

10:54.918 --> 10:56.813
I had Reuben Bowen,
but his press secretary just pulled...

10:56.837 --> 10:58.398
There are 14 senators in this committee.

10:58.422 --> 11:00.502
- One of them wants to talk.
- It's late in the game.

11:00.549 --> 11:03.469
I have some connections
in Sadie Worthington's office.

11:03.552 --> 11:05.179
I can see if I can get her.

11:05.679 --> 11:06.889
Yes! Fuck, yes! This...

11:06.972 --> 11:08.658
Why did you wait until now
to share that information?

11:08.682 --> 11:09.683
- Guys, who cares?
- I...

11:09.767 --> 11:11.477
- Who cares? Just go. Go. Go.
- Going.

11:11.560 --> 11:13.038
I'm gonna push the story as late as I can.

11:13.062 --> 11:14.063
- Keep me updated.
- Okay!

11:14.146 --> 11:15.147
Jesus. Fuck.

11:15.230 --> 11:17.775
- She's a go-getter.
- Yeah. Gorgeous too.

11:18.067 --> 11:20.194
You're so shallow.
Get your head out of the gutter.

11:20.277 --> 11:22.112
I learned by watching you, Dad.

11:22.196 --> 11:26.241
Do you ever pinch yourself because you got
me instead of Alex? I gotta be more fun.

11:26.325 --> 11:27.576
Gee, you think?

11:28.744 --> 11:31.538
- Good mornin'!
- Oh, well, well.

11:31.622 --> 11:34.375
<i>Happy 5-0, Mr. Kessler</i>

11:34.458 --> 11:37.044
Wow. Am I old enough for you yet?

11:37.378 --> 11:41.423
Give it a couple of years. Nothing gets
my juices flowing like an AARP discount.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.634
I will put it in my calendar.

11:44.927 --> 11:49.306
Alison, wow.
That dress is something else. Really nice.

11:49.974 --> 11:51.475
- Alex!
- Yes.

11:51.558 --> 11:53.394
You see that dress that Alison's wearing?

11:54.019 --> 11:57.398
That dress that was just
in my immediate eyeline? Yes, I did.

11:57.982 --> 12:00.693
- I did see it.
- Why don't you wear any dresses like that?

12:00.776 --> 12:02.903
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Hey, Chip, Chip.

12:03.404 --> 12:06.365
Can we get some dresses like that
for Alex? Is that doable?

12:06.448 --> 12:08.093
<i>Yeah, I'll see if I can pull some strings.</i>

12:08.117 --> 12:10.744
Nope. Don't pull anything, Chip.
We're good.

12:10.828 --> 12:13.038
We are live in 30 seconds.

12:13.122 --> 12:14.123
- You know what?
- Mm-mmm.

12:14.707 --> 12:16.643
I would take you in that dress
over Alison any day.

12:16.667 --> 12:17.751
Last looks.

12:18.210 --> 12:19.294
You're so sweet.

12:19.378 --> 12:22.673
Because if you were wearing the dress,
that would mean she's naked.

12:24.091 --> 12:25.843
- There it is!
- Right?

12:25.926 --> 12:27.845
We had it. First of the day, guys.

12:29.930 --> 12:31.307
- You saw that coming.
- I did.

12:31.390 --> 12:32.950
You knew. You knew I was gonna do that.

12:33.017 --> 12:34.703
- I didn't wanna spoil your punch line.
- Thank you.

12:34.727 --> 12:39.440
- Thank you for going with me.
- We are live in five, four, three...

12:41.066 --> 12:42.067
Wow.

12:46.697 --> 12:49.533
Good morning, everyone,
and welcome to <i>The Morning Show</i>.

12:49.616 --> 12:51.785
Our top story today:

12:51.869 --> 12:54.705
Puerto Rico continues to grapple
with the aftermath of Hurricane Maria,

12:54.788 --> 12:58.584
as criticism escalates over
the federal response to the deadly storm.

12:59.084 --> 13:03.047
<i>We now go to Yanko Flores, who is
reporting live from Puerto Rico. Yanko.</i>

13:03.130 --> 13:04.381
- And take it.
<i>- Morning, Mitch.</i>

13:04.465 --> 13:08.510
<i>It's been devastating to witness
conditions here in San Juan today.</i>

13:08.594 --> 13:12.931
<i>The power lines are down.
So many homes are destroyed.</i>

13:13.015 --> 13:14.391
More resources from FEMA,

13:14.475 --> 13:17.186
from the Pentagon,
are expected to arrive early next week.

13:17.603 --> 13:21.607
But until then, the recovery efforts are...
They're proceeding slowly.

13:21.690 --> 13:23.442
How is morale there, Yanko?

13:24.109 --> 13:29.615
<i>Resilient. Truly beautiful, the way that
people are hanging together here on...</i>

13:29.698 --> 13:34.286
la isla del encanto, <i>the Island of
Enchantment as it is affectionately known.</i>

13:34.745 --> 13:37.915
<i>They will recover,
but they could use some caring.</i>

13:37.998 --> 13:43.462
<i>They've had plenty of this force of nature
that just comes through by its own will,</i>

13:43.545 --> 13:46.340
<i>destroys everything and doesn't care.</i>

13:47.216 --> 13:49.885
<i>You have reached the office
of Senator Sadie Worthington.</i>

13:49.968 --> 13:53.263
<i>Due to high call volume, we are
currently unavailable to take your call.</i>

13:53.347 --> 13:54.348
Fuck.

14:01.230 --> 14:03.524
<i>- Hannah?</i>
- Christine, hi.

14:03.607 --> 14:04.984
Thanks for calling me back.

14:05.526 --> 14:08.070
I can't get through to
Senator Worthington's office in DC...

14:08.153 --> 14:10.406
<i>I don't work
for Senator Worthington anymore.</i>

14:10.823 --> 14:13.450
Could you possibly
put me in touch with your...

14:13.534 --> 14:16.078
<i>You never even RSVP'd
to my baby shower.</i>

14:17.579 --> 14:22.001
I'm so sorry.
I'm always traveling for work.

14:22.668 --> 14:24.044
But I do need help.

14:24.128 --> 14:25.963
<i>Or to my goodbye party.</i>

14:29.967 --> 14:31.010
I blew it.

14:32.678 --> 14:33.929
I fuckin' blew it.

14:34.888 --> 14:40.561
I threw myself into work,
and I didn't prioritize our friendship.

14:43.897 --> 14:46.692
I didn't prioritize
any of my personal relationships,

14:46.775 --> 14:48.444
which is clearly not healthy,

14:48.527 --> 14:50.904
but I don't give myself time
to think about that.

14:50.988 --> 14:53.949
<i>I never asked you to put me
ahead of your work.</i>

14:54.033 --> 14:58.245
<i>I only asked for a small amount of decency
from someone I considered my friend.</i>

15:02.249 --> 15:07.046
Listen, I know it doesn't
excuse anything, but...

15:10.883 --> 15:16.513
living in New York by myself
without family, without support...

15:18.432 --> 15:19.850
has been a bitch.

15:21.894 --> 15:23.896
<i>I moved home because I needed it too.</i>

15:31.528 --> 15:35.991
I've just been trying to survive,
you know? It gets scary.

15:36.408 --> 15:38.035
<i>You really hurt my feelings.</i>

15:40.913 --> 15:43.666
I am so sorry.

15:46.335 --> 15:51.048
Really, Christine, I feel horrible.

15:52.675 --> 15:56.011
<i>It's okay, Hannah.
Tell me what you need.</i>

15:57.471 --> 15:58.472
Really?

15:59.723 --> 16:02.101
Coming up, more of our top stories.

16:02.184 --> 16:04.019
And later in the hour,

16:04.103 --> 16:07.314
we sit down with the star of fall's
hottest new show

16:07.398 --> 16:10.109
that's already setting ratings records.

16:10.192 --> 16:14.113
Elsa Hanford from UBA's own
<i>Late Bloomers</i> is with us next.

16:14.196 --> 16:17.324
- Supposed to be great.
- Yep. Oh, wait. What's that?

16:17.408 --> 16:20.035
Yes, yes, yes. And I also hear

16:20.119 --> 16:24.081
that it's someone's big birthday
coming up this weekend.

16:24.498 --> 16:25.499
No, no.

16:25.582 --> 16:28.919
-We are not going to do that, are we?
- Jesus!

16:29.003 --> 16:34.466
<i>Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you</i>

16:34.550 --> 16:36.301
Apparently, we are going to do that.

16:36.385 --> 16:38.846
Yes, we are, my friend.

16:39.638 --> 16:42.266
Stay tuned, everyone.
We will be right back.

16:42.349 --> 16:43.434
Oh, no.

16:43.517 --> 16:46.186
You thought someone shot you, didn't you?
'Cause I did.

16:46.937 --> 16:48.063
And we're clear.

16:48.147 --> 16:49.773
- Oh, God.
- Hey.

16:51.358 --> 16:52.359
Sorry.

16:52.443 --> 16:57.072
What bullshit has been planned
for this horrible, horrible birthday?

16:57.156 --> 17:00.409
Just the normal love wrapped in mockery.

17:00.492 --> 17:03.871
You know it well. A cake, possibly.

17:03.954 --> 17:05.331
God. Fifty! Kill me!

17:05.414 --> 17:07.166
- Yeah.
- Just kill me right now.

17:07.249 --> 17:09.251
You make 50 look so good.

17:09.835 --> 17:11.628
You really do. Happy birthday, honey.

17:11.712 --> 17:14.256
I would not wanna spend it
with anyone other than you.

17:18.719 --> 17:19.720
Thanks, honey.

17:20.638 --> 17:21.972
- Jesus!
- God!

17:22.056 --> 17:23.098
My God!

17:23.599 --> 17:25.017
- Gimme that.
- I hate this.

17:25.100 --> 17:27.269
I'm sorry. It wasn't my idea.

17:27.686 --> 17:29.813
- I gotta get it outta there.
- Get it off of me.

17:29.897 --> 17:32.941
- Here we go.
- Don't...

17:33.776 --> 17:35.378
Don't... What are you doing?
What are you doing?

17:35.402 --> 17:36.403
I can't get it off!

17:36.487 --> 17:39.990
No, no. Come on. Come on. No!
You can't pick up that ball.

17:40.074 --> 17:42.368
You can't pick up that ball. No.

17:43.661 --> 17:46.330
- Goal!
- No. He got it. He got it.

17:46.914 --> 17:48.374
Oh, no.

17:49.041 --> 17:51.377
Oh, no, no.

17:51.793 --> 17:53.921
You gotta go. No, he's coming in.

17:54.003 --> 17:56.130
He's come... Don't do it.

17:57.549 --> 17:59.051
Don't do it.

17:59.468 --> 18:00.719
Mitch.

18:02.303 --> 18:03.806
I thought you were getting ready.

18:03.888 --> 18:04.889
Okay, guys. Guys.

18:04.974 --> 18:08.227
We're supposed to meet Fred and Geneva
at the restaurant in less than an hour.

18:08.310 --> 18:11.397
Like a herd of turtles. Come on. Get up.

18:17.111 --> 18:19.780
Good boys. Thank you.

18:21.115 --> 18:22.741
Let me see.

18:23.033 --> 18:25.536
- Thanks, Mom.
- Napkin on your lap. Napkin on your lap.

18:33.961 --> 18:36.272
- Here. Let me cut that for you. Come here.
- Thank you, Mom.

18:36.296 --> 18:38.549
Can I use your fork? Thanks, honey.

18:42.136 --> 18:43.429
There you go.

19:05.534 --> 19:06.952
I'm sorry, Paige.

19:10.622 --> 19:11.832
Are you kidding?

19:12.666 --> 19:13.959
No, I'm not.

19:18.088 --> 19:19.590
I've been thinking a lot.

19:20.466 --> 19:22.926
Since your most recent affair broke up?

19:27.056 --> 19:28.057
Yes.

19:35.064 --> 19:36.065
I'm sorry.

19:41.445 --> 19:42.446
Okay.

19:46.367 --> 19:49.620
Paige, we've built a life together.
We have two beautiful kids.

19:52.373 --> 19:53.874
I wanna try.

19:58.170 --> 20:00.631
It's hard for me to believe you.

20:01.590 --> 20:02.675
I know.

20:18.107 --> 20:19.358
Oh, shit.

20:20.901 --> 20:22.027
Hey, Chipper.

20:22.111 --> 20:24.655
Don't say anything uncouth.
Paige is in the car.

20:24.738 --> 20:26.073
<i>- Hey, guys.</i>
- Hi.

20:26.156 --> 20:28.200
<i>So sorry to bug you on a Sunday night.</i>

20:28.283 --> 20:30.619
Yeah, and on my birthday, asshole.

20:30.703 --> 20:33.122
<i>Oh, shit. I'm an asshole.</i>

20:33.205 --> 20:36.041
<i>I am so sorry, but I swear
this will just take one second.</i>

20:36.125 --> 20:39.545
Look, pain in the ass, we gotta move up
the attorney general interviews.

20:39.628 --> 20:41.964
I really wanna get you
this research in copy

20:42.047 --> 20:43.799
so you're not flying blind for tomorrow.

20:43.882 --> 20:45.884
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Fine. Just send it to the house.

20:46.844 --> 20:48.762
The restaurant's right by the studio.

20:48.846 --> 20:52.182
We could just stop by in,
like, five minutes and pick it up.

20:52.266 --> 20:54.026
<i>That would be great.
You sure you don't mind?</i>

20:54.560 --> 20:56.562
No, it's fine. Right, Mitch?

21:00.816 --> 21:02.026
Yeah.

21:02.109 --> 21:06.196
Yeah, sure, we'll be late for our dinner,
but that's fine.

21:06.280 --> 21:07.281
<i>Okay.</i>

21:07.364 --> 21:10.200
I will leave it with security.
Have a good night.

21:12.202 --> 21:13.662
It'll just take a second.

21:27.259 --> 21:30.220
- Hey, Jim.
- Hey, Mitch. What are you doing here?

21:31.513 --> 21:33.265
Chip said he had some papers for me.

21:33.349 --> 21:34.850
He didn't leave anything with me.

21:34.933 --> 21:37.895
But I can look around and see if he left
them with Pat before I got here.

21:37.978 --> 21:38.979
Is Chip here?

21:40.105 --> 21:43.484
Yeah. Looks like he's in the studio.
You have to go through the control room.

21:43.567 --> 21:46.236
They're buffing the floors
outside the greenroom.

21:46.320 --> 21:48.405
- Okay, thank you.
- You're welcome.

21:48.489 --> 21:50.032
"Buffing the floors."

22:07.424 --> 22:09.551
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

22:10.552 --> 22:12.262
Oh, my God!

22:15.432 --> 22:17.351
Oh, God. Were you surprised?

22:17.434 --> 22:18.811
So fucking surprised.

22:18.894 --> 22:21.438
Well, buckle up, mister.
This is gonna get better.

22:24.483 --> 22:25.734
Here we go. Come on.

22:26.944 --> 22:28.278
- Look at that!
- I know.

22:31.365 --> 22:32.908
When did you do this?

22:32.992 --> 22:35.619
Oh, you know,
all the spare time that I have.

22:40.582 --> 22:42.334
Oh, my God!

22:43.085 --> 22:44.670
What the fuck?

22:47.589 --> 22:48.966
- No, no.
- You're in heaven.

22:49.049 --> 22:51.385
- You're in heaven. Come on. Look.
- Oh, yes.

22:51.468 --> 22:52.469
Look.

22:53.262 --> 22:55.222
Sit, sit, sit.

22:55.848 --> 22:57.224
Sit, sit.

23:05.983 --> 23:07.943
Let the party begin!

23:12.573 --> 23:14.116

23:18.329 --> 23:22.124

<i>- This an interview</i>
- You're a dead man.

24:03.540 --> 24:07.211
<i>If only the good die young, old man
What does that say for you?</i>

24:08.253 --> 24:11.632
No, stop it! Hang on. Stop it.
Stop it. Stop the music. Enough.

Can you hear me?

24:16.095 --> 24:18.180
Are you able to walk to your seat?

24:18.263 --> 24:20.182
Don't do this. Please don't do this.

24:20.265 --> 24:24.436
This man has a very delicate prostate.
So this is a long journey for him.

Ooh. Oh, boy.

Thank you.

25:54.485 --> 25:55.527
Let's do it again!

26:01.241 --> 26:02.242
Hey.

26:03.911 --> 26:05.287
More please, sir.

26:08.624 --> 26:11.043
This is where he breaks it
before he rides it.

26:12.252 --> 26:14.088
- That fits like a glove.
- Yeah. That's it.

26:14.171 --> 26:16.131
- I like it.
- I wanna try this.

26:16.215 --> 26:18.717
- Oh, no.
- Don't do... No.

26:18.801 --> 26:20.719
- Ready?
- Okay.

26:20.803 --> 26:23.472
- God... Put your leg over the back of it.
- No, no, no.

26:23.555 --> 26:25.057
I wanna... I'm doing sidesaddle.

26:25.557 --> 26:27.851
Fred, why hasn't Dick done a show
for the network?

26:27.935 --> 26:30.521
I'm sorry. You might have him
confused with some other Dick Lundy

26:30.604 --> 26:32.207
who would deign
to do broadcast television.

26:32.231 --> 26:34.483
This guy is a filmmaker, damn it.
He wears berets.

26:34.900 --> 26:37.945
We should send Dick
to meet with Cory Ellison.

26:38.028 --> 26:39.947
Yeah, do a little spin-off
of <i>Late Bloomers</i>.

26:40.030 --> 26:42.241
After all,
it is the number one show in America.

26:42.324 --> 26:44.118
All the bus stops say so.
It's gotta be true.

26:44.201 --> 26:45.953
That's the middle-aged lesbian show?

26:46.036 --> 26:47.997
The major hit "middle-age lesbian show."

26:48.080 --> 26:49.665
Listen, I gotta hand it to the guy.

26:49.748 --> 26:53.377
Only Cory would have taken that pitch,
let alone put it on the air.

26:53.460 --> 26:56.130
Jesus. And in his first
development season? It's ballsy.

26:56.213 --> 26:57.214
The guy takes chances.

26:57.297 --> 26:59.675
- Yeah.
- Now, he's a little... unusual.

26:59.758 --> 27:01.260
- He's weird.
- He does take chances.

27:01.343 --> 27:04.221
Well, that's why he's the president
of entertainment and not news.

27:04.305 --> 27:06.366
I don't know, Reid.
You might have to take some big swings.

27:06.390 --> 27:08.030
<i>Your Day, America's </i>nipping at our heels.

27:08.100 --> 27:10.477
Okay. I'll start by adding lesbians.

27:11.103 --> 27:13.480
Good call.
I'm gonna go check on the real cake.

27:13.564 --> 27:14.732
Good talking to you, Chip.

27:15.774 --> 27:17.276
How much did the Ducati cost us?

27:17.359 --> 27:20.738
Not that much really.
I mean, it's a custom job. Ninety K or so.

27:20.821 --> 27:23.615
It hardly seems enough given how much
money he's made for the network.

27:23.699 --> 27:25.326
- Yeah.
- I'm glad to see him so happy.

27:25.409 --> 27:27.786
We're lucky to have him.
He just gets better with age.

27:27.870 --> 27:29.163
Yeah.

27:31.915 --> 27:34.043
Have you seen the last numbers on Alex?

27:35.336 --> 27:38.922
Yeah. I can accept the scores
on trustworthiness.

27:39.006 --> 27:40.817
In this climate,
every journalist has taken a hit,

27:40.841 --> 27:43.469
but her authenticity
and relatability numbers?

27:43.552 --> 27:44.553
- Yeah.
- Shit.

27:44.637 --> 27:46.472
- Yeah.
- When did that fucking happen?

27:47.056 --> 27:49.475
People just see her as
rich and powerful now.

27:50.017 --> 27:52.936
A "girl next door" was always her magic.

27:53.687 --> 27:55.898
Yeah. Breaks my heart.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.567
It never would occur to me,
when I hired her,

27:58.651 --> 28:01.487
that I might still be around to
put her out to pasture.

28:02.821 --> 28:05.908
Come on. We're not there yet.
We can still reinvent her a little.

28:09.078 --> 28:11.413
Yeah. Yeah. Course. Sure.

28:11.997 --> 28:14.041
We give it time. Let's see what happens.

28:15.918 --> 28:19.672
Time is cruel,
and youth is wasted on the young.

28:28.806 --> 28:30.808
Excuse me, Yanko.

28:31.225 --> 28:34.353
I just wanted to introduce myself.
I'm Claire. I'm the new PA.

28:34.436 --> 28:37.022
- Hey. Nice to meet you. Hi.
- Hey. Nice to meet you.

28:37.106 --> 28:39.316
Well, welcome. Welcome to the show.

28:40.025 --> 28:42.277
It's quite a baptism into this world.

28:42.361 --> 28:45.114
Yeah, and I plan to christen myself
in gin and tonics.

28:45.197 --> 28:46.323
- Nice.
- By the way,

28:46.407 --> 28:48.701
I really enjoyed your piece
on Puerto Rico.

28:48.784 --> 28:51.161
It was incredibly moving.
You're very good.

28:51.245 --> 28:54.581
And I can tell that doing the weather
actually means something to you,

28:54.665 --> 28:56.542
which is unusual. And nice.

28:57.334 --> 28:58.961
Well, thank you, Claire.

29:00.045 --> 29:02.006
You have a great deal of depth, don't you?

29:03.924 --> 29:06.593
No. No. I'm actually incredibly shallow.

29:08.053 --> 29:09.722
Well, I'll be the judge of that.

29:11.390 --> 29:13.684
- Enjoy the party.
- Yeah. You too.

29:26.030 --> 29:28.532
- Here's some people. Hello, everyone.
- Oh, hey. Hi.

29:28.615 --> 29:31.869
- How are you?
- I know, I know. Don't make a big deal.

29:32.328 --> 29:35.748
Oh, hey. Hey.
Nice job getting that senator Friday.

29:36.749 --> 29:39.168
Oh, yeah. Wow. How'd you know?

29:39.585 --> 29:43.088
Well, I kinda know everything that goes on
around this place.

29:43.172 --> 29:45.841
I know that Jared... Where is he?

29:45.924 --> 29:49.803
Jared is lazy and complacent,
and you did the right thing speaking up.

29:51.013 --> 29:54.141
You know what you did?
You made the show better on Friday.

29:54.224 --> 29:55.559
Categorically better.

29:55.643 --> 29:59.897
So, thank you for your efforts,
and keep up the good work.

30:00.898 --> 30:01.899
Thank you so much.

30:10.324 --> 30:14.328
Mitch Kessler, we are lucky to have you.

30:14.995 --> 30:18.874
I am so lucky to have you.
Happy birthday, honey.

30:19.917 --> 30:21.794
Get up here and make some wishes.

30:22.294 --> 30:24.046
You've got about 50 of them.

30:25.381 --> 30:29.343
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

30:29.426 --> 30:30.719
- Here you go.
- Oh, my gosh.

30:30.803 --> 30:34.181
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

30:34.264 --> 30:39.520
<i>Happy birthday, dear Mitch</i>

30:39.937 --> 30:45.567
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

30:52.616 --> 30:58.998
I'm very, very fortunate to have friends
like this and like this in my life.

30:59.415 --> 31:00.874
And as the last candle burns out,

31:01.750 --> 31:05.462
I say thank you so much for coming
and for being my friends. Thank you.

31:05.796 --> 31:06.964
Cheers.

31:08.757 --> 31:13.846
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

31:13.929 --> 31:17.808
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

31:17.891 --> 31:21.020
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

31:21.103 --> 31:23.147
<i>Nobody can deny</i>

31:24.606 --> 31:27.318
I can't believe you.
You put together that whole thing.

31:28.068 --> 31:32.656
I picked the song, I wrote the lyrics,
I auditioned the dancers.

31:32.740 --> 31:35.409
Oh, that's it. That's it.
It all makes sense now.

31:35.492 --> 31:39.830
No. Stop it. Stop it.
I did it because I love you, Mitch.

31:39.913 --> 31:40.914
- I do.
- Oh, God.

31:40.998 --> 31:45.461
It just so happens that loving you
comes with certain fringe benefits.

31:46.920 --> 31:50.507
There are some people out there
who would vehemently disagree with you.

31:50.591 --> 31:53.344
Oh, fuck 'em! You know?

31:53.427 --> 31:54.987
One of the great things of getting old.

31:55.012 --> 31:58.182
You can just say,
"Fuck 'em, fuck it, fuck off."

31:58.932 --> 32:01.602
And be at peace with it.
You've nothing left to prove.

32:01.685 --> 32:04.772
You've carved out your place in the world,

32:05.606 --> 32:08.609
and no one and nobody can take that away.

32:10.444 --> 32:12.488
Yeah, I get that I've accomplished a lot,

32:12.571 --> 32:15.949
but it just doesn't feel like
it really matters. You know?

32:16.784 --> 32:20.954
I mean, this is all fun,
but is that all there is?

32:22.748 --> 32:27.086
I've let down people I love.
Maybe that's my legacy.

32:27.961 --> 32:30.089
At the end, maybe that's it.

32:31.131 --> 32:33.550
Please. Please, please.

32:34.134 --> 32:37.638
Look, I don't know what you've done,

32:37.721 --> 32:42.017
and you certainly don't have to tell me,
but, trust me,

32:42.476 --> 32:44.269
they're gonna get over it.

32:44.353 --> 32:45.354
They will.

32:47.815 --> 32:49.191
Although Penny...

32:51.110 --> 32:52.820
Penny never got over it.

32:55.155 --> 32:56.156
What did you do?

32:56.573 --> 32:57.950
I married Rita.

33:00.577 --> 33:02.788
- And that was a big success, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

33:02.871 --> 33:07.042
Jesus Christ.
How do I even have any money at all?

33:07.126 --> 33:08.627
I don't know.

33:08.711 --> 33:10.713
You know what? Here's the thing.

33:10.796 --> 33:13.257
You are Mitch Kessler.

33:14.133 --> 33:17.094
That matters. Don't forget that.

33:20.889 --> 33:22.766
Doesn't really feel like it matters.

33:25.602 --> 33:27.354
You know, you do all of this stuff,

33:27.438 --> 33:31.358
you achieve all of these things,
and then, at the end of the day,

33:31.442 --> 33:34.778
you're just looking at it
through a car window as you drive by.

33:34.862 --> 33:36.655
Just doesn't fill you up.

33:36.739 --> 33:38.824
You have your films.

33:38.907 --> 33:39.908
Oh, please.

33:39.992 --> 33:42.036
Dick Lundy films will be around forever.

33:42.119 --> 33:45.289
I am ephemeral.
Nobody re-watches the news,

33:45.706 --> 33:49.752
unless it's a plane flying into a building
or assassination or something.

33:49.835 --> 33:51.712
Thank God those things
don't happen very often.

33:51.795 --> 33:52.796
But...

33:54.506 --> 33:58.218
nobody re-watches
"Fall Fashion Trends 2006."

34:00.012 --> 34:02.973
So you say. Where do you think
I got the idea for this outfit?

34:13.859 --> 34:16.737
Well, I have had too much to drink.

34:19.823 --> 34:21.325
So you're heading out?

34:21.408 --> 34:23.702
Nah. I have to be here
in a couple of hours.

34:24.244 --> 34:25.663
I'll sleep when I'm dead.

34:29.333 --> 34:30.793
Fuck it.

34:32.586 --> 34:33.712
Fuck it!

34:34.963 --> 34:36.590
That's my boy.

35:06.286 --> 35:08.080
- Chip.
- I'm up. What happened?

35:08.538 --> 35:10.698
There's a shooting in Las Vegas,
happening as we speak.

35:11.792 --> 35:14.169
Oh, fu... Holy fuck. Okay, I got it.

35:14.253 --> 35:17.297
It's active.
Outside a concert near Mandalay Bay.

35:17.381 --> 35:19.108
The police have been dispatched
to the hotel.

35:19.132 --> 35:21.927
Wait, someone's
firing into a fucking concert?

35:22.011 --> 35:23.012
Rena, get in here.

35:23.554 --> 35:26.015
I mean... Is it still active?
How many are dead? Jesus Christ.

35:26.098 --> 35:27.141
It's not clear.

35:27.224 --> 35:30.227
Someone is saying that there
are multiple shooters in multiple hotels.

35:30.311 --> 35:31.812
I saw that, but it's unconfirmed.

35:33.647 --> 35:36.650
Let's get... Let's get somebody from LA
to cover it right now.

35:36.734 --> 35:39.611
- Go get Mitch and Alex and tell 'em we...
- Mitch is still here.

35:39.695 --> 35:42.132
Get him! Make sure he gets on a plane
as soon as fucking possible.

35:42.156 --> 35:43.883
- Got it!
- I'll call Reid, get the jet approved.

35:43.907 --> 35:46.188
Get Mitch and Alex on that plane
fucking five minutes ago.

35:46.243 --> 35:47.244
Copy.

35:50.914 --> 35:52.416
Oh, Mitch. Good, you're ready.

35:52.499 --> 35:56.003
Car is waiting outside, and
Alex is already on her way to the airport.

35:56.086 --> 35:58.505
We're sending Alex too?
You think that's necessary?

35:58.589 --> 36:02.176
I mean, this is huge. We're doing the
whole show from there, so I need you both.

36:02.593 --> 36:05.387
Okay. If that's your call, Captain.

36:05.471 --> 36:08.307
Chip, I can't get ahold of Jared.
I'm still trying...

36:08.390 --> 36:10.434
You know what? Fuck Jared. He's slipping.

36:11.685 --> 36:14.229
Send that junior booker, Hannah.
She's excellent.

36:15.814 --> 36:16.982
Yeah, that's a good idea.

36:17.066 --> 36:20.319
- Let's find Hannah, and find Mia for me.
- Okay.

36:20.402 --> 36:22.404
Hey, I've been meaning
to talk to you about Mia.

36:22.488 --> 36:25.574
I think maybe you should take her off
my team, put her on Alex's team.

36:26.492 --> 36:28.577
It's just kind of uncomfortable right now.

36:28.661 --> 36:30.913
She's great,
but it's not a good situation.

36:33.999 --> 36:35.959
Mitch wants to move you off his team.

36:38.379 --> 36:39.588
Why?

36:41.090 --> 36:43.425
I think it's just too awkward.

36:47.763 --> 36:49.240
He's punishing me for breaking things off.

36:49.264 --> 36:50.617
- No, he is not.
- Yeah, he is. Come on.

36:50.641 --> 36:52.226
Do not take this personally, okay?

36:53.727 --> 36:55.354
Things got messy, okay?

36:55.437 --> 36:58.649
It's nobody's fault, but he does have
a right to say who he wants on his team.

36:58.732 --> 37:00.734
And I'm sorry. It's...

37:03.320 --> 37:04.321
Where you gonna put me?

37:04.822 --> 37:06.865
- On Alex's team.
- Oh, my God.

37:06.949 --> 37:10.244
It's gonna be best, all things considered.
I'll speak with her about it.

37:12.246 --> 37:13.539
So I'm not going to Vegas?

37:14.289 --> 37:15.290
No.

37:15.708 --> 37:17.334
You get to stay back here with me.

37:20.504 --> 37:23.507
Listen. I really need
your help on this one.

37:26.343 --> 37:27.428
Okay, boss.

37:28.512 --> 37:30.889
I'll get on social,
figure out everything I can.

37:36.395 --> 37:37.396
Shit.

37:37.479 --> 37:39.773
It's gonna be a block of rooms.
Fifteen people.

37:39.857 --> 37:43.235
At least two suites,
as close to the scene as possible.

37:43.319 --> 37:44.462
- You're looking for me?
- Yeah.

37:44.486 --> 37:46.155
You're going to Vegas to do the booking.

37:46.238 --> 37:47.865
- Me?
- Yeah, you're leaving now.

37:47.948 --> 37:49.033
What about Jared?

37:49.116 --> 37:50.826
Mitch wants you. So...

37:53.912 --> 37:56.749
Congrats.
Now get the fuck out of here. Please.

37:57.541 --> 37:58.542
Thank you.

38:03.005 --> 38:05.966
<i>All units, we have shots fired
at the Route 91 Harvest Festival.</i>

38:06.050 --> 38:07.650
<i>Shots are coming from the higher floors.</i>

38:07.926 --> 38:11.722
<i>Details are extremely limited at this
time, but here's what we do know.</i>

38:11.805 --> 38:14.683
<i>There is one, possibly two shooters</i>

38:14.767 --> 38:17.645
<i>that began opening fire from
the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino...</i>

38:17.728 --> 38:20.564
- Oh, my God.
- <i>on one of the top floors.</i>

38:20.648 --> 38:22.250
<i>They're firing into
the Route 91 Harvest Festival.</i>

38:22.274 --> 38:24.526
We'll feed you updates as we get 'em.

38:24.610 --> 38:26.362
<i>- Concert performer Jason Aldean...</i>
- Okay.

38:26.445 --> 38:28.989
<i>- Had just taken the stage.</i>
- All right. Let's go.

38:29.073 --> 38:31.617
<i>The concertgoers
thought they were hearing fireworks.</i>

38:38.082 --> 38:39.083
Sick.

38:45.839 --> 38:47.549
Why do people keep doing this?

38:47.633 --> 38:49.051
I wish I knew.

38:49.718 --> 38:51.470
It's just so overwhelming.

38:51.971 --> 38:54.098
- You can't cry right now.
- I know. I know.

38:54.181 --> 38:55.659
- Think of something else.
- Okay, okay.

38:55.683 --> 38:57.267
- Do Kegels.
- Oh, God.

38:57.351 --> 38:59.687
- Okay. We're live in five...
- I'm sorry.

38:59.770 --> 39:02.147
Four, three...

39:06.318 --> 39:08.112
We're coming to you from Las Vegas,

39:08.195 --> 39:11.407
where over 50 people are confirmed dead
and hundreds injured

39:11.490 --> 39:15.786
in what will go down as the deadliest
mass shooting in US history.

39:16.620 --> 39:20.082
Last night, a gunman opened fire
from the window of a guest room

39:20.165 --> 39:24.336
at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino
into a sea of concertgoers

39:24.420 --> 39:27.214
at the Route 91 Harvest Festival.

39:27.297 --> 39:29.591
A motive has yet to be determined.

39:30.009 --> 39:35.014
As a city and a nation mourn
in the wake of this horrific tragedy,

39:35.097 --> 39:39.768
we will be with you to try to make sense
of an act that cannot be made sense of.

39:42.271 --> 39:44.148
Yes, okay. Of course.

39:44.648 --> 39:45.941
All right, see you soon.

39:47.818 --> 39:49.153
- Hey, Greg.
- Yeah.

39:49.236 --> 39:53.073
I'm gonna meet a girl
whose friend was killed last night.

39:53.866 --> 39:56.660
She thinks she might be willing
to go on the show tomorrow.

39:57.202 --> 39:58.203
Good work, Hannah.

39:59.163 --> 40:00.164
Okay.

40:08.756 --> 40:10.507
Do you think we're dead inside?

40:12.509 --> 40:15.054
I think we're in an induced coma.

40:19.391 --> 40:21.393
How long can we keep doing this?

40:23.062 --> 40:28.651
It's just not natural
to face this kind of pain...

40:29.485 --> 40:32.571
this often... on this level.

40:34.281 --> 40:37.159
Yeah, I don't know. It's awful.

40:38.243 --> 40:40.412
But it might be
the most natural thing there is.

40:42.289 --> 40:45.793
Pain is the most innate part
of the human experience I can think of.

40:50.130 --> 40:52.341
It's very depressing.

40:54.093 --> 41:00.015
It's funny, because, really, the unnatural
part is having this much money.

41:01.809 --> 41:06.105
Part of being this successful is having
enough money to not have to see the pain.

41:06.563 --> 41:09.191
That's why everybody wants to live
in these really nice,

41:09.274 --> 41:11.902
upscale, safe neighborhoods.

41:12.528 --> 41:17.116
So they don't have to
see the realities of life.

41:20.828 --> 41:22.997
The world is unfair and sad.

41:23.497 --> 41:24.748
It's ugly.

41:25.374 --> 41:27.459
And we hide from it in our wealth.

41:29.211 --> 41:31.755
But then the way you and I make our money,

41:31.839 --> 41:35.592
is we put ourselves right in the middle
of everybody else's pain.

41:41.974 --> 41:43.559
But here we are,

41:44.143 --> 41:47.146
with no escape hatch
on this very lucrative,

41:47.229 --> 41:50.024
highly visible hamster wheel from hell.

41:51.984 --> 41:56.780
I don't know how I would do all of this
every day if I didn't have you.

41:57.698 --> 41:58.866
I really don't.

42:01.160 --> 42:02.661
Well, Alex...

42:06.123 --> 42:10.586
you are my best friend,
and all bullshit aside,

42:10.669 --> 42:12.296
you're like a part of me.

42:12.880 --> 42:14.214
You always will be.

42:15.883 --> 42:17.176
Me too, honey.

42:27.269 --> 42:28.937
Okay. We should get back to the hotel.

42:29.021 --> 42:31.732
No. No, no. Don't go.

42:31.815 --> 42:35.027
There's a bar somewhere
with our name on it, calling to us.

42:35.110 --> 42:36.737
We should go drinking.

42:39.740 --> 42:42.493
You have barely slept in 48 hours.

42:43.410 --> 42:44.828
It's time to put you to bed.

42:44.912 --> 42:46.330
- I know. You're right.
- I know.

42:46.997 --> 42:48.540
- You're always right.
- Yeah.

42:49.166 --> 42:51.085
Will you always tell me what to do?

42:51.460 --> 42:52.461
I can do that.

43:32.668 --> 43:34.420
- Hey, man. What's up?
- Hey.

44:27.348 --> 44:28.641
Hey. Hiya.

44:30.100 --> 44:31.185
How you doing?

44:32.436 --> 44:34.480
Oh, I'm fine.

44:35.731 --> 44:36.774
Really?

44:38.692 --> 44:42.279
You shouldn't be.
There's nothing fine about this.

44:52.289 --> 44:53.666
Let's walk back to the hotel.

45:01.757 --> 45:04.551
This is tough. This one especially.

45:06.887 --> 45:10.099
You know, you can't beat yourself up
over not being a robot.

45:10.432 --> 45:14.269
Sometimes you just have to
feel sad as shit and live with it.

45:15.688 --> 45:18.065
Okay then. I'm sad as shit.

45:19.274 --> 45:20.275
That-a-girl.

45:26.073 --> 45:29.660
I don't think I've ever learned
so much in a single day.

45:30.369 --> 45:32.371
Yeah, you're a sponge, aren't you?

45:32.454 --> 45:35.791
You just absorb stuff.
Absorb all sorts of information.

45:35.874 --> 45:37.126
That's what makes you smart.

45:38.085 --> 45:42.214
And you really care about your job.
That's why I wanted you to be here.

45:46.760 --> 45:47.761
Thank you.

45:49.138 --> 45:50.139
Thank you.

46:09.658 --> 46:12.369
<i>Chip, this doesn't make any sense.</i>

46:12.453 --> 46:15.998
<i>I was just with him.
He didn't mention a word about this.</i>

46:16.373 --> 46:18.000
Does he honestly think I'm...

46:18.792 --> 46:22.463
No, I'm not...
I'm not taking Mitch's hand-me-downs.

46:22.546 --> 46:24.465
Alex, Mia is not a hand-me-down.

46:25.215 --> 46:27.593
<i>So, he's not comfortable with her
on his team?</i>

46:27.676 --> 46:30.554
Well, I'm not comfortable with her
on my team. You know what?

46:31.472 --> 46:34.183
He can shit where he eats
all that he wants,

46:34.266 --> 46:37.186
but I am not his fucking trash can.

46:38.187 --> 46:42.733
Okay. Hold on. Okay. Mitch has done
really, really well with Mia on his team.

46:42.816 --> 46:45.778
And maybe with her on your team, you know,
she might help you...

46:45.861 --> 46:50.908
Are you really trying to tell me that
Mia on my team will help me test better?

46:51.950 --> 46:53.869
No, Alex, all I am saying is you...

46:53.952 --> 46:55.120
<i>No, that's it. I'm done.</i>

46:55.204 --> 46:56.830
I'm hanging up on you. I'm over this.

46:56.914 --> 46:58.082
<i>Alex... Come on.</i>

47:03.170 --> 47:04.213
Fuck.

47:05.047 --> 47:06.256
Great.

47:08.634 --> 47:10.678
<i>You know what I think about
when I'm sad as shit...</i>

47:10.761 --> 47:13.347
- What?
- And trying not to kill myself?

47:13.430 --> 47:14.473
Stupid things.

47:15.641 --> 47:20.938
Like this one time, I was younger
than you, just getting started.

47:21.772 --> 47:25.317
KQWK in Sacramento,

47:25.818 --> 47:29.446
ten minutes before 6:00,
the anchor's appendix burst.

47:30.197 --> 47:33.742
That's... No. That's not...
That's not the funny part.

47:34.451 --> 47:38.998
So, none of the fill-ins were available,
so they came to me.

47:39.498 --> 47:42.543
Now, I assure you,
I was way, way down on their list.

47:42.626 --> 47:45.421
I bet that they went to the janitor
before they came to me.

47:45.504 --> 47:46.964
They asked him, he turned it down,

47:47.047 --> 47:49.675
and then they came knocking
on Mitch Kessler's door.

47:50.426 --> 47:53.220
And I was scared shitless.

47:53.304 --> 47:57.391
My shit had left town on a bus.

48:00.019 --> 48:03.564
But I just figured, you know, I want this.

48:04.440 --> 48:08.360
This is my opportunity to show the people
who make the decisions

48:08.444 --> 48:09.737
that I got the goods.

48:10.154 --> 48:11.822
So, I gathered myself,

48:12.239 --> 48:14.742
I put on my very finest tie,

48:15.492 --> 48:19.121
and I went and I assumed my place
at the anchor desk.

48:19.913 --> 48:21.874
And then I passed out.

48:22.833 --> 48:25.669
And I went right over
the back of the chair.

48:25.753 --> 48:28.839
And I woke up in an ambulance.

48:28.922 --> 48:34.428
The EMTs told me that I kept throwing
to them for sports and weather.

48:35.137 --> 48:38.849
Twenty-seven stitches. Look at that.
Right there.

48:38.932 --> 48:40.684
- Oh, my God.
- Yep.

48:40.768 --> 48:43.854
I am very happy
that I don't have Daniel's hair.

48:44.938 --> 48:45.939
You...

48:46.774 --> 48:49.234
You didn't fall out of a chair.
You're doing great.

48:50.736 --> 48:54.573
I know that this is a really dark day
to associate with your big break,

48:54.657 --> 48:56.950
but that's the gig.

48:57.743 --> 49:02.665
Sometimes it's strange, sometimes
downright awful, but you're doing it.

49:05.125 --> 49:08.879
And you are helping to bring the news
to the world,

49:08.962 --> 49:10.589
and you should be proud of that.

49:12.508 --> 49:15.844
- Thank you.
- Oh, yeah. I'm a font of wisdom.

49:16.512 --> 49:18.180
I appreciate the pep talk.

49:18.263 --> 49:21.016
Yuck. Thank you. Thank you.

49:22.309 --> 49:26.021
Actually, when I'm really depressed,

49:26.105 --> 49:29.316
there is one thing that I do have
in my arsenal.

49:32.027 --> 49:33.904
<i>Why don't you
improve your lie a little, sir?</i>

49:33.988 --> 49:35.990
<i>Yes, yes. Winter rules. Right.</i>

49:36.073 --> 49:37.467
I can't believe you've never seen this.

49:37.491 --> 49:39.034
<i>Double farts!</i>

49:41.787 --> 49:43.789
<i>- Fore!
- Fine shot.</i>

49:49.086 --> 49:50.796
<i>I shoulda yelled "two."</i>

49:50.879 --> 49:53.439
- Wow. Is it really that bad?
- <i>Why don't you walk this off, sir?</i>

49:53.465 --> 49:55.926
- You hate it.
- I'm sorry.

49:56.010 --> 49:57.450
<i>Hey, what do you got in here? Rocks?</i>

49:57.511 --> 50:01.056
<i>Are you kidding? When I was your age,
I would lug 50 pounds of ice up five...</i>

50:01.140 --> 50:05.894
It's just... I'm not an expert
at shoving it down just yet. I'm sorry.

50:05.978 --> 50:07.479
- I'll try...
- No, no, no.

50:10.691 --> 50:12.526
You're probably healthier than I am.

50:16.780 --> 50:19.408
Maybe I'm just tired,
and it's catching up with me.

50:20.659 --> 50:21.785
Yeah.

50:23.787 --> 50:25.456
I should go.

50:29.543 --> 50:32.296
I know you have to be up early,
'cause I do too.

50:32.379 --> 50:33.380
No, it's okay.

50:35.132 --> 50:36.300
Thanks.

51:03.410 --> 51:04.787
You smell good.

51:17.716 --> 51:18.717
I like you.

51:22.805 --> 51:25.015
I like you too.

51:43.951 --> 51:46.996
This isn't what
I expected when I came up here.

51:47.496 --> 51:48.580
I know.

51:49.289 --> 51:51.250
It's a nice surprise though, isn't it?

51:53.168 --> 51:54.253
You know?

51:55.295 --> 51:56.338
Hey.

51:59.174 --> 52:00.968
It's okay. Just wanna feel good.

52:09.393 --> 52:11.020
You're so beautiful.

52:14.356 --> 52:15.524
It's okay.

54:16.478 --> 54:18.355
-Push that story in.
- Yes, sir.

54:19.523 --> 54:21.400
-Yeah, everything's up and ready.
- Right.

54:21.483 --> 54:23.277
- Ready to go.
- Yeah.

54:23.360 --> 54:24.903
We just need to come up with...

54:25.529 --> 54:27.573
No, that's exactly what he said.

54:28.907 --> 54:31.452
So we're just gonna put that up front now.

54:32.453 --> 54:34.872
We're turning to something
a little bit more...

54:36.957 --> 54:38.250
Hannah.

54:40.336 --> 54:41.795
Hannah.

54:41.879 --> 54:43.339
Here are the Springsteen tickets

54:43.422 --> 54:46.425
that Jared needed
for the mother of the septuplets.

54:47.593 --> 54:49.094
- Oh, right. Yeah.
- Yeah.

54:49.178 --> 54:50.512
I'll get those to him.

54:52.097 --> 54:53.098
Hey.

54:54.516 --> 54:55.851
How was Vegas?

55:00.105 --> 55:02.733
- It was really sad.
- Yeah.

55:12.868 --> 55:14.787
- Hey, Mitch. Welcome back.
- Thank you.

55:18.791 --> 55:19.792
Hey, Hannah.

57:00.768 --> 57:03.395
Hey. You can't go in there right now.

57:05.064 --> 57:06.940
I work downstairs. I need to speak to you.

57:07.024 --> 57:10.027
- I'm sorry. I told her...
- No, it's fine, James. Give us a moment.

57:17.576 --> 57:20.287
I just got back from Las Vegas
with <i>The Morning Show</i>.

57:23.791 --> 57:25.042
What is it, dear?

57:33.884 --> 57:38.889
Mitch Kessler invited me to his room
to watch a movie, and he wound up...

57:42.726 --> 57:43.769
He...

57:45.437 --> 57:47.439
He wound up...

57:48.816 --> 57:50.192
He...

57:50.818 --> 57:52.152
You don't have to say it.

57:53.320 --> 57:54.822
You don't have to say anything.

57:56.407 --> 57:57.658
What's your name?

58:01.370 --> 58:05.207
I'm Han... I'm Hannah Shoenfeld.
I'm a junior booker.

58:06.875 --> 58:08.127
Hannah Shoenfeld.

58:15.259 --> 58:18.554
I've heard about you.
I hear you're doing some great work.

58:22.725 --> 58:24.184
Hannah Shoenfeld,

58:25.060 --> 58:26.895
I heard head booker...

58:28.522 --> 58:30.024
might be in your future.

58:42.286 --> 58:43.287
So...

58:43.996 --> 58:45.956
So this is how it happens?

58:48.667 --> 58:52.046
Absolutely. People do fantastic work,
and they get promoted.

58:52.129 --> 58:54.882
That is absolutely how it happens.

59:05.351 --> 59:06.352
So...

59:08.312 --> 59:10.189
I'm head booker now?

59:13.567 --> 59:14.568
Yes.

59:23.786 --> 59:24.787
Okay.

1:00:00.698 --> 1:00:04.368
The Times<i> article details shocking
allegations against Weinstein</i>

1:00:04.451 --> 1:00:05.828
<i>from eight different women,</i>

1:00:05.911 --> 1:00:08.789

<i>The story also alleges that Weinstein</i>

1:00:22.594 --> 1:00:24.875
<i>has been paying off his accusers
for over three decades...</i>

1:00:24.930 --> 1:00:26.557
Wow, what a creep.

1:00:27.558 --> 1:00:29.351

- <i>allegedly for $50 million.</i>
- What a pig.

1:00:45.826 --> 1:00:49.496
<i>A spokeswoman for the</i> Times
