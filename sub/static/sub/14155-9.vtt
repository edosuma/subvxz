40:57.667 --> 40:59.033
WHO DOES HE THINK I AM?
SOME CLUELESS KID

40:59.067 --> 41:00.700
POSTING SONGS ON YouTube?

41:01.933 --> 41:04.633
[ CLEARS THROAT ]

41:04.667 --> 41:05.833

41:05.867 --> 41:07.700
EVERYTHING AIN'T
WHAT IT SEEMS.

41:07.733 --> 41:10.367

THE WHISPER-WHISPER SIGH ABOUT?

41:10.400 --> 41:11.800
ME AND GABE ARE GONNA
HAVE A THREESOME.

41:12.900 --> 41:16.300
