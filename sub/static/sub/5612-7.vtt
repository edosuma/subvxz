Hey, Jakey, the place
on the corner

00:02.636 --> 00:04.537
is serving lemonade,
and you get to keep the jar.

00:04.538 --> 00:05.872
It's pretty cool.

00:05.873 --> 00:08.775
Yes, that's very cool, Scully.

00:08.776 --> 00:09.776
Mm-hmm.

00:09.777 --> 00:11.210
Will you excuse me
just one moment?

00:11.211 --> 00:12.210
Oh, sure.

00:12.212 --> 00:14.213
Guys, guys, guys!

00:14.214 --> 00:16.449
Scully has a mason jar
full of lemonade.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.917
You called us in here
to tell us that?

00:17.918 --> 00:20.386
No, I called you in here
to change your lives!

00:20.387 --> 00:22.221
For, you see,
a mere five minutes ago,

00:22.222 --> 00:23.222
Hitchcock introduced me

00:23.223 --> 00:24.657
to his new goldfish,
who lives in...

00:24.658 --> 00:25.658
[gasps]

00:25.659 --> 00:26.726
An identical mason jar!

00:26.727 --> 00:28.899
Oh, this isn't gonna end well.

00:28.900 --> 00:30.063
There are two possible outcomes,

00:30.064 --> 00:31.998
and we're going to bet on
which one happens first.

00:31.999 --> 00:34.534
So, will Hitchcock put fish
food in Scully's lemonade,

00:34.535 --> 00:36.302
or will Scully drink
Hitchcock's goldfish?

00:36.303 --> 00:37.336
Now, you would think that

00:37.337 --> 00:38.805
putting fish food
into lemonade...

00:38.806 --> 00:40.239
Hitchcock just drank
his own fish.

00:40.240 --> 00:41.240

00:41.241 --> 00:44.959

- Hey, guys.

02:07.094 --> 02:08.961
I just discovered
a new drug too.

02:08.961 --> 02:11.030
It's called "your relationship,"

You can't call a kid stupid.

02:20.674 --> 02:21.941

02:21.942 --> 02:23.476
Terry, this is Sam,
my little brother

02:23.477 --> 02:24.744

02:24.745 --> 02:26.512
I think it's funny

- No one cares, stupid.
- Screw you, Rosa.

02:28.715 --> 02:30.983
Sam's selling candy to pay
for his basketball uniforms.

02:30.984 --> 02:33.119

I taught him how to elbow.

02:39.026 --> 02:40.126
She's not that scary.

02:40.127 --> 02:41.527
She used to do ballet.

02:41.528 --> 02:42.562
No way.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.030

02:53.140 --> 02:55.074
It's called "taxi"
because it's yellow,

02:55.075 --> 02:57.176
and it takes you
where you need to be.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.978
Drug dealers have gotten
so creative.

02:58.979 --> 03:01.080
It used to just be "crack,"
and then they'd be like,

03:01.081 --> 03:03.082
"Hey, we got a new one.
What are we gonna call this?"

03:03.083 --> 03:04.617
And they'd go,
"I don't know, crank?"

This is certainly worth
following up on.

That's why HR Jim
keeps high-fiving me.

03:32.079 --> 03:35.781
As a rule, I don't put couples
in the field together,

03:35.782 --> 03:39.485

detectives, so I will allow it.

There's no personal issues here.

- We've never even had a fight.
- It's true.

03:46.026 --> 03:47.193
Our only close call

03:47.194 --> 03:48.995
was when Jake didn't know

- Nice takedown.
- Thanks.

07:25.992 --> 07:27.559
- Oh, my God.
- What?

07:27.560 --> 07:29.728
Nothing, nothing.
Let's just take this guy in.

07:29.729 --> 07:30.762
No. What is it?

07:30.763 --> 07:32.931
It's just... this mattress

07:32.932 --> 07:34.600
looks just like
your mattress at home.

07:34.601 --> 07:35.968
What?
No, it doesn't.

07:35.969 --> 07:38.170
I mean, sure, there are
a couple of similarities, but...

07:38.171 --> 07:39.171
oh, man.

07:39.172 --> 07:40.205
It's the exact same one.

07:40.206 --> 07:42.140
Ugh!
I have a dumpster mattress!

07:42.141 --> 07:43.308
All right. That settles it.

07:43.309 --> 07:44.543
We're going mattress shopping.

07:44.544 --> 07:45.544
Seriously?

07:45.545 --> 07:46.812
Oh, this is the best.

07:46.813 --> 07:48.347
I'm so proud of you.

07:48.348 --> 07:51.016
You know, once we get it,
we'll have to break it in.

07:51.017 --> 07:52.951
Oh, I hear what you're saying:

07:52.952 --> 07:54.353
Mattress trampoline.

07:54.354 --> 07:55.821
Wait, no.
You were talking about sex.

07:55.822 --> 07:57.522
- Yeah.
- Then mattress trampoline.

07:57.523 --> 07:59.223
- Sure.
- Okay.

08:00.827 --> 08:03.061
Diaz, your friend Sam is here.

08:03.062 --> 08:04.196
Nice.

08:04.197 --> 08:06.198
That little dum-dum
finished his homework early.

08:06.199 --> 08:07.231
Where is he?

08:07.267 --> 08:08.634
Before I answer,

08:08.635 --> 08:11.737
maybe we could brew a pot
of nice, relaxing kava tea,

08:11.738 --> 08:12.905
- and then...
- Spit it out.

08:12.906 --> 08:14.705
Sam was brought in
for shoplifting a phone.

08:17.577 --> 08:18.710
I also have chamomile!

08:18.711 --> 08:20.112
That might calm us down.

08:20.113 --> 08:22.714
Oh, if you want calm,
there's some ludes in evidence,

08:22.715 --> 08:24.290
if anybody would ever
let me get them out.

08:24.317 --> 08:25.317
Hey!

08:25.318 --> 08:26.718
What were you thinking?

08:26.719 --> 08:27.719
I made a mistake!

08:27.720 --> 08:29.054
The phones were
just lying there,

08:29.055 --> 08:30.455
and I didn't
think things through.

08:30.456 --> 08:31.757
I'm sorry, Rosa.

08:31.758 --> 08:33.825
Rosa is your friend
from before you were a criminal.

08:33.826 --> 08:35.427
You are dealing
with Detective Diaz now,

08:35.428 --> 08:37.328
and she is gonna make sure
you rot in juvie

08:37.330 --> 08:38.330
for the rest of your life.

08:38.331 --> 08:39.331
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:39.332 --> 08:40.807
Can I talk to you for a minute?

08:44.570 --> 08:46.705
It feels like you're being
a little harsh.

08:46.706 --> 08:47.906
Thanks. Good note.

08:47.907 --> 08:49.808
I was going for extremely harsh.
I'll turn it up.

08:49.809 --> 08:51.810
Diaz, he's just a kid.

08:51.811 --> 08:53.412
Can't you just let him off
with a warning?

08:53.413 --> 08:55.514
Sometimes,
being as tough as possible

08:55.515 --> 08:57.049
doesn't lead
to the best outcome.

08:57.050 --> 08:59.751
This isn't Cagney
calling Lacey a poopy-head.

08:59.752 --> 09:02.087
I'm not just gonna
give him a time-out.

09:02.088 --> 09:03.121
Time-out?

09:03.122 --> 09:04.423
Are you kidding?

09:04.424 --> 09:07.960
"Poopy-head" means
no "Doc McStuffins" for a week!

10:02.315 --> 10:03.315
Mm.

10:03.316 --> 10:05.984

Hello, Brian.

10:48.995 --> 10:50.896
Coming on a little
strong there, buddy...

10:50.897 --> 10:51.897

How much to take

That is much too much money.

Well, you spent twice that

11:00.740 --> 11:02.574
for Mr. Met to come
to your birthday party.

11:02.575 --> 11:04.142
Yeah, and it was worth it.

11:04.143 --> 11:05.977
Mr. Met used my bathroom.
Number two.

11:05.978 --> 11:08.313
That's a memory
I will cherish forever.

11:08.314 --> 11:11.917
Look, mattresses are expensive,
but they're an investment.

11:11.918 --> 11:13.685
It's gonna be in your life

11:13.686 --> 11:16.555
True, but it's also
still just a mattress, you know?

11:16.556 --> 11:18.290
It's a lot of money
to spend on a rectangle

11:18.291 --> 11:19.991
that's filled with springs
and goose hair.

11:19.992 --> 11:21.493
- You know it's feathers.
- I didn't.

11:21.494 --> 11:23.295
And it would be
money well spent,

11:23.296 --> 11:25.730
because it would allow me
to actually sleep in your bed.

11:25.731 --> 11:26.998
But I already have a mattress.

11:26.999 --> 11:28.333
It just doesn't seem worth it.

11:28.334 --> 11:30.335
Okay, well, to me,

11:30.336 --> 11:32.404
it sounds like you're saying
I'm not worth it.

11:32.405 --> 11:34.906
So I'm gonna go sleep
in my grown-up mattress

11:34.907 --> 11:37.708
that I bought this century,
and you're not invited.

11:39.912 --> 11:42.247

mattresses being an investment.

11:42.248 --> 11:43.389

11:48.018 --> 11:49.017
Morning.

11:50.354 --> 11:51.586
You look well-rested.

11:51.622 --> 11:54.724
Yes, because I slept
in my own bed.

11:54.725 --> 11:55.891
I was tossing and turning.

11:55.926 --> 11:57.260
Jake told me about your fight,

11:57.261 --> 11:58.827
and I'm so worried

11:58.862 --> 11:59.861
Thank you, Charles.

11:59.897 --> 12:01.898

the mattress myself?

12:02.900 --> 12:03.900
- Problem solved.
- No.

12:03.901 --> 12:05.001

- Yeah.
- Super mellow and chill.

12:10.774 --> 12:11.874
Yeah.

12:11.875 --> 12:13.109
- She slapped my butt once.
- Mm-hmm.

12:13.110 --> 12:14.342
We're definitely
falling in love.

12:14.378 --> 12:15.778
- All right.
- Good, good, good.

12:15.779 --> 12:17.980

on the dealer you brought in:

12:17.981 --> 12:19.615
Two matchbooks
from the same hotel.

12:19.616 --> 12:21.517
He's refusing to give up
his supplier,

12:21.518 --> 12:23.252
but this could be something.

12:23.253 --> 12:24.587
That's weird.
Look at this.

12:24.588 --> 12:26.923
The same two matches
are missing from both books:

12:26.924 --> 12:29.058
Third one on the bottom row,
and fifth one from the top.

12:29.059 --> 12:30.393
- Coincidence?
- No way.

12:30.394 --> 12:32.295
No one would
take matches out like that.

12:32.296 --> 12:34.130
Trust me; I smoked
four cigarettes in college.

12:34.131 --> 12:35.131

12:35.132 --> 12:36.431
That's a code.

12:38.702 --> 12:40.503
I'll go get my pencil case.

12:40.504 --> 12:41.703

- Well, great.

- The cupcake was Gertie.
- Yes.

14:52.736 --> 14:54.770
- Your butt was Charles's car.
- Yes.

14:54.771 --> 14:56.105
The chair was the parking space.

14:56.106 --> 14:57.206
Yes, I get it.

14:57.207 --> 14:58.474
Your office was the garage.

14:58.475 --> 15:00.275
Yes, I'm telling you
I understand the lesson.

15:00.310 --> 15:04.079
And I was the brilliant
Gina Linetti in both scenarios.

15:04.114 --> 15:05.547
All right.
We're done here.

15:05.582 --> 15:06.748
'Kay.

15:08.552 --> 15:10.118
You're a great captain.

15:11.421 --> 15:13.589
Jake, why don't you
just sit down?

15:13.590 --> 15:14.657
No, thank you.

15:14.658 --> 15:16.092
I can see the feed better
from here.

15:16.093 --> 15:17.893
It's really comfortable.

15:17.894 --> 15:20.161
All right.
I'll sit.

15:21.531 --> 15:22.798
[sighs]

15:22.799 --> 15:24.466
Nope, my butt
hates expensive things.

15:24.501 --> 15:25.501
No.

15:25.502 --> 15:26.769
You know what your butt hates?

15:26.770 --> 15:28.803
Making any sort of
sacrifice for us,

15:28.839 --> 15:31.040
because it's not serious
about this relationship.

15:31.041 --> 15:33.409
Okay, first of all,
my butt is so serious

15:33.410 --> 15:34.844
it should be wearing spectacles.

15:34.845 --> 15:36.245
And second, your butt
is the butt

15:36.246 --> 15:38.047
that is not serious
about this relationship.

15:38.048 --> 15:39.048
[scoffs]

15:39.049 --> 15:40.983
My butt is totally serious.

15:40.984 --> 15:42.618
I've made all kinds of changes.

15:42.619 --> 15:44.487
I bought orange soda for you.

15:44.488 --> 15:45.755
Okay!

15:45.756 --> 15:50.226
For the last time, Orangina
is not orange soda.

15:50.227 --> 15:52.161
Yeah, because it's better.

15:52.162 --> 15:54.463
Uh, okay, now you're
just being crazy.

15:54.464 --> 15:56.632
Ugh, you're not even taking
this argument seriously.

15:56.633 --> 15:58.134
All right.
You want to get serious?

15:58.135 --> 16:00.403
How come you haven't told
your mom that we're dating?

16:00.404 --> 16:01.569
Yeah, that's right.

16:01.605 --> 16:03.406
I saw the text she sent you
about setting you up

16:03.407 --> 16:04.373
with some dude named Gary.

16:04.374 --> 16:05.474
You read my texts?

16:05.475 --> 16:07.076
It buzzed when you were
in the bathroom.

16:07.077 --> 16:09.078
Who doesn't bring their phone
with them into the bathroom?

16:09.079 --> 16:10.613
That's, like, the whole reason
to go in there.

16:10.614 --> 16:12.681
I haven't told her because
I haven't had the chance.

16:12.682 --> 16:13.716
What?

16:13.717 --> 16:14.750
You talk to her, like,
every week.

16:14.751 --> 16:15.851
You basically stalk her.

16:15.852 --> 16:17.086
Why don't you just admit

16:17.087 --> 16:19.021
that you don't want
to tell her about me?

16:19.022 --> 16:20.990
Jake, it's not about you.

16:20.991 --> 16:23.659
Look; The minute I tell her
that I'm dating someone,

16:23.660 --> 16:25.327
she's gonna call me all the time

16:25.328 --> 16:27.596
and ask me a million
annoying questions.

16:27.597 --> 16:29.999
Wow, it sounds like
such a huge drag.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.966
I guess I'm just not "worth it."

16:32.002 --> 16:33.301
Boom... used the thing
you said to me

16:33.336 --> 16:34.703
in a different argument
in this argument.

16:34.704 --> 16:35.703
I win the argument.

16:35.705 --> 16:37.439
Oh, no, no, no.
This is bad.

16:37.474 --> 16:39.041
Well, you started it...
or I did.

16:39.042 --> 16:40.643
- I can't remember at this point.
- No, Jake.

16:40.644 --> 16:42.178
Look at the screen.

16:42.179 --> 16:43.946
Oh, no.

16:43.947 --> 16:48.184
<i>For the last time,
Orangina is not orange soda.</i>

16:48.185 --> 16:49.919
<i>Yeah, because it's better.</i>

16:49.920 --> 16:53.088
<i>Uh, okay, now you're just
being crazy.</i>

16:53.089 --> 16:55.190
<i>You're not even taking this...</i>

16:55.225 --> 16:57.059
You do have to admit,
it was a pretty good point

16:57.060 --> 16:58.426
about Orangina, though.

17:05.875 --> 17:07.308
Your turn, Peralta.

17:07.344 --> 17:09.109
Thank you, Santiago.

17:11.114 --> 17:12.280
Okay.

17:13.883 --> 17:15.951
I know you're mad,
but before you say anything,

17:15.952 --> 17:17.518
yes, we screwed up.

17:17.554 --> 17:19.188
And yes, you warned us.

17:19.189 --> 17:21.557
And yes, I don't know
where I'm going with this.

17:21.558 --> 17:23.325
But I do know this:

17:23.326 --> 17:25.359
I have reached
the end of my sentence.

17:27.364 --> 17:28.329
Oh, my God. Did that work?

17:28.365 --> 17:29.632
- Not at all.
- Oh.

17:29.633 --> 17:32.368
I can't believe
you let a personal argument

17:32.369 --> 17:34.202
derail your investigation.

17:34.237 --> 17:35.571
I would characterize it more

17:35.572 --> 17:37.572
as a professional
police disagreement.

17:37.607 --> 17:39.140
- I listened to the tape.
- Oh, no.

17:39.175 --> 17:41.176
Yeah, well, then you know
that it was a straight-up

17:41.177 --> 17:42.411
crazy bitch fight.

17:42.412 --> 17:44.546
Look; I know we screwed up
the case, and I'm sorry.

17:44.547 --> 17:45.914
But if it's any consolation,

17:45.915 --> 17:48.416
I think we also screwed up
our relationship.

17:48.451 --> 17:49.785
Peralta, have a seat.

17:49.786 --> 17:51.754
I believe this might help.

17:51.755 --> 17:53.722
When Kevin
and I first started dating,

17:53.723 --> 17:55.691
he taught at a small
college upstate.

17:55.692 --> 17:58.060
It was two hours away
by train or bus,

17:58.061 --> 17:59.928
but only 30 minutes by car.

17:59.929 --> 18:01.430
Is this another one
of your riddles?

18:01.431 --> 18:03.132
You rode to work
on his shoulders.

18:03.133 --> 18:05.100
One set of footprints. No?

18:05.101 --> 18:06.567
- No.
- Okay.

18:06.603 --> 18:07.970
Neither of us owned a car,

18:07.971 --> 18:09.905
and I didn't want to buy one
because that would mean

18:09.906 --> 18:11.473
admitting
that I cared for Kevin.

18:11.474 --> 18:13.875
He had the same fear,
and so visits were rare,

18:13.910 --> 18:15.077
and I was miserable.

18:15.078 --> 18:17.846
Then one spring day,
Kevin showed up at my door

18:17.847 --> 18:19.782
having purchased Gertie.

18:19.783 --> 18:22.851
He took the leap,
and I'm so grateful that he did.

18:22.852 --> 18:26.188
I only regret that I didn't
do it first.

18:26.189 --> 18:27.790
Do you understand?

18:27.791 --> 18:29.792
Absolutely.

18:29.793 --> 18:30.925
100%.

18:30.960 --> 18:31.959
The train is your old mattress.

18:31.995 --> 18:33.227
- Yeah.
- The car is your new mattress.

18:33.263 --> 18:34.262
- I got it.
- Kevin is you.

18:34.297 --> 18:35.396
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm Santiago.

18:35.432 --> 18:37.332
Loud and clear.
100%.

18:38.835 --> 18:39.835
[clangs]

18:39.836 --> 18:40.936
So I took care of Sam.

18:40.937 --> 18:41.936
Uh-oh.

18:41.938 --> 18:45.373
That sounds ominous, like you
went all Ms. Miriam on him.

18:45.408 --> 18:46.742
I let him off with a warning.

18:46.743 --> 18:50.045
See, thing about Ms. Miriam
is she made me a good dancer,

18:50.046 --> 18:52.580
but she ruined my childhood.

18:52.615 --> 18:54.950
She was constantly riding me
about my posture

18:54.951 --> 18:56.651
and my technique
and my pink hair.

18:56.686 --> 18:57.985
- Pink hair.
- Never speak of that.

18:58.021 --> 18:59.254
Copy.

18:59.255 --> 19:01.090
She's the reason I quit ballet,

19:01.091 --> 19:02.391
and I sure as hell
don't want Sam

19:02.392 --> 19:04.960
to quit the Big Brother program
'cause of me.

19:04.961 --> 19:06.962
This is totally

19:06.963 --> 19:10.899
how I thought this Ms. Miriam
thing was gonna go.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.668
Another flawless Terry plan.

19:13.703 --> 19:15.303
Boyle, I thought
you should know.

19:15.338 --> 19:17.139
I just got Gertie back
from the garage.

19:17.140 --> 19:18.907
She looks as good as new.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.509
Better, even,
because after 12 years,

19:20.510 --> 19:22.211
they finally got
the Annie Lennox cassette

19:22.212 --> 19:23.211
out of the tape player.

19:23.213 --> 19:24.612
Oh, I love her.

19:24.647 --> 19:26.214
Here's a check
for the full amount.

19:28.284 --> 19:29.984
You don't owe me anything.

19:30.019 --> 19:32.721
It was my fault,
and I behaved poorly,

19:32.722 --> 19:35.124
as Gina made abundantly clear.

19:35.125 --> 19:39.360
Oh, speaking of, you still
owe me $14 for that cupcake.

19:39.396 --> 19:40.996
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:40.997 --> 19:42.231
What's up?

19:42.232 --> 19:43.232
Two things.

19:43.233 --> 19:44.633
I ran the footage from the hotel

19:44.634 --> 19:46.834
through facial recognition
software and got a match:

19:46.870 --> 19:48.504
Grady Lamont.

19:48.505 --> 19:50.339
This is his current address.

19:50.340 --> 19:51.339
That's good, I guess.

19:51.341 --> 19:52.640
Yeah, it's six years old.

19:52.675 --> 19:54.709
Well, druggies are lazy?

19:54.744 --> 19:55.810
He deals in uppers.

19:55.845 --> 19:57.045
- We're screwed.
- Yup.

19:57.046 --> 19:58.947
What's the second thing?

19:58.948 --> 20:00.681
Well, the Captain
and I were jamming

20:00.717 --> 20:03.218
on some personal issues,
just going back and forth.

20:03.219 --> 20:05.787
I honestly think I helped him
more than he helped me.

20:05.822 --> 20:07.522
- I'm not buying any of that.
- No.

20:09.659 --> 20:10.926
[sighs]

20:10.927 --> 20:14.729
Amy Santiago... I want
to change mattresses for you.

20:16.332 --> 20:18.032
That's the best thing
I've ever heard.

20:18.067 --> 20:19.902
I'm sorry I didn't do it sooner.

20:19.903 --> 20:22.905
I think I was just scared
that you were gonna realize

20:22.906 --> 20:24.373
you're way better than me.

20:24.374 --> 20:27.809
Like, you're Orangina,
and I'm orange soda.

20:27.844 --> 20:29.111
Are you kidding?

20:29.112 --> 20:30.244
You're Orangina.

20:30.280 --> 20:31.280
Ugh.

20:31.281 --> 20:32.413
Don't say that.

20:32.449 --> 20:34.183
Look.

20:34.184 --> 20:36.251
I was scared too.

20:36.252 --> 20:37.518
I'm gonna call my mom tonight.

20:40.023 --> 20:42.057
Okay.

20:42.058 --> 20:44.059
Let's buy this baby.

20:44.060 --> 20:47.996
Calling up the website,
finding the mattress,

20:47.997 --> 20:51.266
adding to cart, signing
in as "guest"...

20:51.267 --> 20:53.035
That is not an option.

20:53.036 --> 20:54.536
Creating an account...

20:54.537 --> 20:56.217
You don't have to buy it
right this second.

20:56.239 --> 20:59.174
Nope, this is a big romantic
gesture, and I'm nailing it.

20:59.175 --> 21:01.910
Shipping address...
not the same as billing address.

21:01.911 --> 21:03.511
Got to enter both of those.

21:03.546 --> 21:05.347
Jake, Jake, look!
There's our guy.

21:05.348 --> 21:06.681
Oh, perfect timing.

21:06.716 --> 21:07.816
Submit order.

21:07.817 --> 21:09.017
Province? Oh, no.

21:09.018 --> 21:10.218
We're on the Canadian website.

21:10.220 --> 21:11.353
Click on the American flag.

21:11.354 --> 21:12.386
- Jake!
- Yeah.

21:12.422 --> 21:13.421
We'll do this later.
Let's go!
