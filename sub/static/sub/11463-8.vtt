WEBVTT

00:38.413 --> 00:40.119
They were close friends.

00:40.832 --> 00:42.948
I saw them a few days ago.

00:43.001 --> 00:45.583
They had food, water.

00:45.670 --> 00:47.126
They were okay.

00:49.549 --> 00:51.631
Things change so quickly now.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.101
Where are you going?

01:11.154 --> 01:13.145
South. La Paz. Juan's
father is there.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.942
South. La Paz. Juan's
father is there.

01:14.991 --> 01:16.982
I must try to ﬁnd him.
I owe it to him.

01:16.993 --> 01:18.028
I must try to ﬁnd him.
I owe it to him.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.488
To his mother.

01:19.579 --> 01:22.491
You should come with us.

01:24.459 --> 01:26.666
The others, where will they go?

01:27.212 --> 01:29.168
They'll do as everyone else.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.421
Search for family, sanctuary.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.420
Will they stay together?

01:45.897 --> 01:47.933
You want to follow them?

01:47.982 --> 01:49.973
Is there a place to go
for people like Celia?

01:49.984 --> 01:51.269
Is there a place to go
for people like Celia?

01:51.361 --> 01:54.319
There was talk of heading
north to the city.

01:54.405 --> 01:56.487
There are more there
who embrace the dead.

01:56.574 --> 01:59.156
But there has been talk
of a hundred places.

02:00.245 --> 02:02.076
It's not safe to go alone, Nick.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.404
The north road is
full of La Manas.

02:04.499 --> 02:06.285
They are the worst of men

02:06.376 --> 02:08.617
and this is the lawless world
they've been waiting for.

02:08.711 --> 02:10.622
You don't want to go?

02:10.713 --> 02:12.704
SI’, but not with Juan.

02:12.715 --> 02:14.376
SI’, but not with Juan.

02:14.467 --> 02:16.378
There are too many orphans.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.845
If his father is alive, he
deserves the chance to find him.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.386
Yeah.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.282
There is a mountain shaped like
the ridge of a woman's back.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.453
There is a mountain shaped like
the ridge of a woman's back.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.080
Do you see?

02:51.129 --> 02:52.915
- Yeah.
- Head for it.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.042
The highway north
is just beyond.

02:55.091 --> 02:56.831
Okay.

02:56.926 --> 02:59.303
Should be enough
to get you there.

02:59.345 --> 03:02.303
- Just.
- Thank you.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.885
This will be the least
of your worries.

03:04.976 --> 03:06.762
It won't be an easy trip.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.218
I know.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.362
Juan.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.032
Good luck.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.207
- I hope you find him.

06:29.430 --> 06:31.921
Come on, at least try.

06:32.016 --> 06:33.677
I am, asshole.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.475
Your thumbs are freakishly long.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.512
Dexterous thumbs.
Dexterous thumbs.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.388
Dexterous thumbs.
Dexterous thumbs.

06:40.441 --> 06:42.898
Look, you're pathetic.
You know that?

06:42.985 --> 06:44.976
Oh, type A girl
doesn't like losing.

06:44.987 --> 06:46.272
Oh, type A girl
doesn't like losing.

06:46.322 --> 06:48.358
Type A girl doesn't lose.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.818
One more.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.366
Sure, if we practice.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.744
- Come on.
- Nick, you need to practice.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.742
I am not gonna
shit on my parents

06:56.833 --> 06:59.165
for a "get out of
jail free" card.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.743
Not gonna do it.

07:01.838 --> 07:04.705
Remember Graham Holt?

07:04.799 --> 07:06.790
He had court-mandated rehab
for dealing, same as you.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.257
He had court-mandated rehab
for dealing, same as you.

07:08.302 --> 07:10.293
Um, I was holding for someone.

07:10.304 --> 07:11.589
Um, I was holding for someone.

07:11.639 --> 07:13.925
Mm, where is he?

07:14.851 --> 07:16.216
Good question.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.722
Mm-hmm. On family day,

07:18.813 --> 07:21.395
Graham Holt wouldn't
talk to his folks

07:21.441 --> 07:23.602
so the judge gave
him another month.

07:25.194 --> 07:27.105
You want that?

07:33.494 --> 07:35.485
So after your three
weeks in rehab, Nick,

07:35.496 --> 07:36.827
So after your three
weeks in rehab, Nick,

07:36.914 --> 07:38.905
exploring your thoughts and
feelings about your drug use,

07:38.916 --> 07:40.497
exploring your thoughts and
feelings about your drug use,

07:40.543 --> 07:43.376
are there things you
need to say to me?

07:43.421 --> 07:46.379
- You?
- Pretend I'm your dad.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.380
Start with my mom.

07:48.426 --> 07:49.757
VVhy?

07:49.844 --> 07:51.835
She's like a school counselor.

07:51.846 --> 07:52.926
She's like a school counselor.

07:53.014 --> 07:55.346
She has degrees in this shit.
My dad...

07:57.185 --> 07:59.176
- What?
- He wouldn't hurt a fly.

07:59.270 --> 08:01.636
I'm notjust gonna rip into
him like this for no reason.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.722
- It'll kill him.
- Four more weeks!

08:03.733 --> 08:04.813
- It'll kill him.
- Four more weeks!

08:04.901 --> 08:06.892
Come on, there's got to be something
he does that irritates you.

08:06.903 --> 08:08.689
Come on, there's got to be something
he does that irritates you.

08:08.779 --> 08:10.770
Yeah, sure, but...

08:10.781 --> 08:11.816
Yeah, sure, but...

08:11.908 --> 08:14.240
Use that.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.113
Dad, you're always tired.

08:16.204 --> 08:18.695
- Nick.
- No, no, he is.

08:18.789 --> 08:20.780
You're always tired when
you get home from work.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.661
You just skip dinner
and go to your room.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.951
And ifl go in there to talk to
you, it's like you do listen

08:25.046 --> 08:27.037
and I can tell you hear me, but
it's not like you're there.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.788
and I can tell you hear me, but
it's not like you're there.

08:28.883 --> 08:31.044
You used to be there.

08:31.135 --> 08:32.636
And then you stopped.

08:32.678 --> 08:35.215
And / don 't know
why you did that.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.297
Fathers are supposed to show sons
how to be a man in the world,

08:37.308 --> 08:38.718
Fathers are supposed to show sons
how to be a man in the world,

08:38.809 --> 08:40.970
but I guess the world
is too much for you.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.379
Ah.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.435
Get out of my house!

11:34.694 --> 11:35.774
Get out!

11:36.570 --> 11:38.026
Get away from my daughter!

11:39.949 --> 11:40.984
Get out of my house!

11:42.159 --> 11:43.490
Fuck oﬁ!

11:43.744 --> 11:44.699
Okay.

11:44.787 --> 11:47.324
- Get away from my daughter!
- Okay, okay.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.203
Are you deaf or what?

11:48.249 --> 11:50.831
I thought it was empty.
Okay, |-- shit!

11:50.918 --> 11:52.874
- Okay.
- I'm gonna kill you! Fuck off/

11:52.920 --> 11:55.161
- Okay. Let me just get my bag, all right?
- I'm gonna kill you!

11:55.256 --> 11:57.463
Then I'm gonna go.
I'm just gonna get my bag.

11:57.550 --> 12:00.417
- Let me just get my water. I'll just
get my bag. - Are you deaf?

12:00.511 --> 12:01.296
Okay.

12:01.387 --> 12:02.593
I'm gonna kill you!

12:03.389 --> 12:04.299
Fuck oﬁ!

12:06.183 --> 12:07.969
Damn bastard!

12:08.602 --> 12:10.513
Honey! Are you alright, Honey?

12:12.857 --> 12:14.097
Don 't come back!

14:05.928 --> 14:07.793
This one's mine.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.246
There 's another one alive.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.703
Water...

14:44.633 --> 14:47.045
Water... please...

14:52.016 --> 14:53.881
Oh...

14:58.564 --> 14:59.314
Water...

15:05.905 --> 15:06.735
"Water. .. "

15:18.375 --> 15:19.239
Hey!

15:23.631 --> 15:25.212
After him!

15:27.426 --> 15:28.336
Shoot him!

20:42.699 --> 20:44.655
You okay?

20:44.743 --> 20:46.574
Not really.

20:46.662 --> 20:49.404
They're probably more
nervous than you are.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.834
- Here we go.

20:57.589 --> 20:59.545
- Is that them?
- Please sign in.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.919
- Hello, Bel Air.
- I don't live in Bel Air.

21:02.010 --> 21:04.296
- Beverly Hills?
- Shut up.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.131
That her?

21:09.184 --> 21:11.015
Oh...

21:14.564 --> 21:16.100
Good luck.

21:16.149 --> 21:18.140
All will be well in the garden.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.236
Nick, you and your mom are gonna
meet in private for a moment, okay?

21:30.247 --> 21:32.579
Nick, you and your mom are gonna
meet in private for a moment, okay?

21:33.750 --> 21:35.411
Okay.

21:42.509 --> 21:44.465
No Dad?

21:52.311 --> 21:54.302
Daddy's not coming.

21:54.354 --> 21:56.094
Couldn't get out of bed?

21:58.025 --> 21:59.981
He--

22:00.068 --> 22:01.569
he was in an accident.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.769
At the site?

22:06.241 --> 22:08.106
Coming home.

22:10.996 --> 22:13.203
It was a head-on collision.

22:21.131 --> 22:23.167
He didn't make it, baby.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.167
He didn't make it.

22:45.530 --> 22:47.191
They say he didn't suffer.

22:47.240 --> 22:49.231
They say?

22:49.242 --> 22:51.858
They say?

22:51.953 --> 22:53.864
Hold on.

23:05.675 --> 23:07.381
I'm so sorry.

28:07.477 --> 28:09.889
Follow us.

28:13.024 --> 28:15.015
We 7/ take you home.

28:15.026 --> 28:16.232
We 7/ take you home.

28:19.572 --> 28:21.699
Come with us.

28:24.244 --> 28:26.235
Come. Come home.

28:26.246 --> 28:29.033
Come. Come home.

28:29.124 --> 28:31.615
Follow us.

28:31.668 --> 28:33.078
Home.

28:33.169 --> 28:35.455
Come.

28:37.924 --> 28:40.290
Come with me.

28:47.308 --> 28:49.515
I'll take you home.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.108
Come on, you fucking freaks!

32:22.649 --> 32:24.435
That's not him.

32:27.570 --> 32:29.856
- We should help him.
- No, Francisco.

32:34.202 --> 32:36.067
But he was running with 'em.

32:49.759 --> 32:51.215
Not anymore.

32:51.928 --> 32:53.964
- Luciana...
- Let's go.

32:55.431 --> 32:56.932
Luci! He 7/ die!

33:30.591 --> 33:32.331
Is it good?

33:33.761 --> 33:36.628
My dad gave it to me.

33:36.723 --> 33:38.588
He gave you a lot of books.

33:38.683 --> 33:41.390
It was his way of connecting.

33:41.477 --> 33:43.092
But is it good?

33:44.689 --> 33:46.145
It reminds me of him.

33:46.190 --> 33:47.896
It's just a lot of
people feeling shit

33:47.942 --> 33:49.557
and not saying
anything about it.

33:53.281 --> 33:56.114
What's it about?

33:56.159 --> 33:58.115
Grotesques.

33:59.203 --> 34:01.740
Please expand.

34:01.831 --> 34:03.822
When you hold on to
something for too long

34:03.833 --> 34:04.948
When you hold on to
something for too long

34:05.001 --> 34:06.832
or too hard, you corrupt it.

34:11.883 --> 34:14.374
Sounds like a page-turner.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.551
That's what my mom used to say.

34:33.154 --> 34:35.019
I want to read it.

34:36.949 --> 34:38.564
You should.

34:45.041 --> 34:47.032
In the morning.

38:16.961 --> 38:18.826
That makes it even worse.

38:19.505 --> 38:20.711
Is that a bite?

38:21.424 --> 38:22.209
Infected?

38:22.967 --> 38:24.958
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no infectado.

38:24.969 --> 38:26.550
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no infectado.

38:26.637 --> 38:28.753
It's a dog. A dog.

38:28.848 --> 38:30.964
Um, perro. Perro.

38:40.735 --> 38:41.565
Water?

38:56.667 --> 38:58.498
I know someone who can help you.

39:04.008 --> 39:04.963
Come.

39:41.170 --> 39:43.582
You shouldn't put
any weight on it.

39:46.092 --> 39:48.048
Please.

40:02.942 --> 40:05.354
I will have to cut
your trousers.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.189
Is that okay?

40:26.424 --> 40:29.086
I'm sorry. You are on
the edge of infection.

40:29.802 --> 40:31.383
You're a doctor, right?

40:31.429 --> 40:34.296
You would have died
in the wilderness.

40:35.558 --> 40:37.139
I wouldn't mind that.

40:39.145 --> 40:41.010
This will hurt.

40:49.155 --> 40:51.567
Strange.

40:51.615 --> 40:53.606
Luciana said you were brave.

40:53.659 --> 40:55.524
I'm not.

40:57.413 --> 40:59.404
No, you are foolish.

40:59.415 --> 41:01.406
No, you are foolish.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.620
Death is not to be feared,

41:03.711 --> 41:05.872
but it shouldn't be pursued.

41:05.963 --> 41:07.499
There's a difference.

41:09.925 --> 41:12.382
Steady.

41:14.638 --> 41:16.594
You will recover.

41:19.602 --> 41:21.809
My friends say you were
walking with the dead.

41:23.481 --> 41:25.642
Safety in numbers.

41:25.691 --> 41:27.773
That is strange company.

41:27.860 --> 41:30.146
Safer than the men with guns.

41:32.406 --> 41:34.021
Where did you travel from?

41:34.116 --> 41:35.652
Valle de Guadalupe.

41:35.701 --> 41:37.612
That's a long walk.

41:37.661 --> 41:39.617
You should be dead.

41:39.663 --> 41:42.621
Coulda, shoulda, woulda.
Story of my life.

41:48.047 --> 41:50.038
Why come all this way?

41:52.051 --> 41:54.417
I want to be where the
dead aren't monsters.

42:24.208 --> 42:26.244
Hello.
