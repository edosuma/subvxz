An outside consulting firm.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.300
Would you mind going

05:35.400 --> 05:38.100
Yeah, okay. Birds are
like little dinosaurs.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.700
Well, there is some fat.

05:59.900 --> 06:01.000
What about sid?

06:01.100 --> 06:04.000
Sid? I can't fire our announcer.
He'll lose his insurance.

06:04.100 --> 06:05.600
You know, he has a lot
of health problems.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.200
Yeah, because he was hit by lightning
And can't really talk anymore.

06:08.300 --> 06:16.400
It's tergis with tracky
ng-Jong And jimmy moop!

06:16.500 --> 06:18.400

06:18.500 --> 06:21.500
I'm not firing any of my people.
I'm not doing that to their families.

06:21.800 --> 06:25.400
Or in sid's case, their much younger wife
With whom they have an open relationship.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.100
All right, we'll find
the money somewhere else.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.500

06:28.600 --> 06:32.800
All right, what about straws?

06:32.900 --> 06:34.200
Okay, fine. No mstraws.

06:34.200 --> 06:36.700
Everyone drinks

06:37.000 --> 06:40.200
- Oh, no, we need straws.
- Oh, god! That's its bathroom!

06:40.800 --> 06:44.200
Listen, liz, i'm gonna need your

Tgs is a complicated machine.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.100
- Every part's important.
- Get it.

06:49.300 --> 06:50.800
You don't want to be
the bad guy.

06:50.900 --> 06:53.100
But if you don't make
the cuts, i will.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.300
And i don't give a crap
about anyone here.

06:58.900 --> 07:01.400
Matthew, i know this isn't ea
But the company's facing cutbacks.

07:01.400 --> 07:04.900
And you have to admit your boom box
division Is a little bit behind the times.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.600
We're not behind the times,
we're groovy!

07:06.700 --> 07:08.600
I can offer you
two weeks severance.

07:08.700 --> 07:12.300
Mr. Donaghy, i know you said only

But we have to act now.

07:19.300 --> 07:22.100
Kenneth, this does not qualify
As something important.

07:22.100 --> 07:23.800
I do not want showtime.

07:23.900 --> 07:25.600
Oh, okay.

I hear people are getting fired.

Yeah. I don't know.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.900

- Pretty well.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.400

09:10.700 --> 09:11.700
I'm cheryl, by the way.

09:11.700 --> 09:13.700
You're gonna try to have sex with jack?

09:13.800 --> 09:16.400
I have to.
I have 15 employees.

09:16.600 --> 09:17.900
I'm responsible for them.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.200
Do you have any idea
what that's like?

09:19.200 --> 09:22.100
Well, yeah, i have
200 people under me, but--

09:22.200 --> 09:25.900
Wow. Maybe we could team up,
go in there together,

09:26.000 --> 09:30.000
- lez out, give him a show.
- No. Cheryl, get a grip.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Oh, boy.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.500
Miss lemon, mr. Donaghy
will see you now.

09:37.600 --> 09:38.600
Make it quick, lemon.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.100
I'm in the middle
of a very unpleasant day.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.200
Okay, well, so am i.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.100
I know this cutback stuff
is difficult.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.600
I don't want to fire anyone.

09:45.700 --> 09:47.700
And i don't want to take
anything away from my crew.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.900
And i want to keep making free,
long-Distance prank calls

09:50.900 --> 09:54.300
To people like seattle's
richard sacmuncher.

09:54.400 --> 09:55.800
And i think
that's reasonable.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.200
So what do i do
to get out of this?

09:57.200 --> 10:00.200
The only thing to do is make your cuts
And live to fight another day.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.800
What? That's it?

10:01.900 --> 10:03.900
I thought you'd tell me
to cook the numbers

10:03.900 --> 10:07.000
Or shred something or do
some pelican brief stuff.

10:07.100 --> 10:08.900
Why is everyone talking
about that movie?

10:08.900 --> 10:10.100
It's playing
on showtime.

10:10.200 --> 10:12.000
Kenneth, get me showtime.

10:12.300 --> 10:14.200
What? Why now?

10:14.400 --> 10:15.300
I'm sorry.

10:15.300 --> 10:17.400
I know this is hard,
but there's no way out of it.

10:17.500 --> 10:20.300
Well, little heads up,
Your next meeting might disagree.

10:20.400 --> 10:23.200
She's planning to change
your mind By hitting...

10:23.800 --> 10:25.900
- ...that.
- Oh, no, not again.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.700
This last guy tried
to take my belt off.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.800
But the sad thing is,
it sometimes works.

10:29.900 --> 10:31.200
Sexual bartering pays off.

10:31.300 --> 10:34.500
Salome. Mata hari.
Deborah norville.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.500
Well, good luck downstairs.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

10:36.900 --> 10:38.100
Oh, and one more thing,

10:38.200 --> 10:41.400
uh, don't cut the straw budget
'Cause i've already cut the exterminators.

10:45.100 --> 10:48.100
Jenna, something weird
is going on.

10:48.300 --> 10:51.000
You mean this budget stuff?
Don't worry about it, tracy.

10:51.100 --> 10:52.900
It's just gonna affect
the non-Specials.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.100
No, it's not that.

10:55.200 --> 10:57.700
Jenna, you're the smartest
person i know.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.900
You think kenneth
could be a murderer?

11:00.100 --> 11:01.900
What? Why would you
think that?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Well, i might be crazy,

11:04.200 --> 11:07.300
But neither he nor his bird
would let me into his bedroom.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.900
And why wouldn't you want
to let tracy jordan Into your bedroom

11:09.900 --> 11:11.900
unless you got a bunch
Of dead nurses in there?

11:12.000 --> 11:16.000
Well, i had to study serial killers To prepare
for my role as criminal profiler Jill st. Ferrari

11:16.600 --> 11:19.300
in the lifetime original
miniseries Hushed rapings.

11:19.500 --> 11:22.700
And all masked murderers
share three characteristics:

11:22.800 --> 11:24.200
Cruelty to animals...

11:24.200 --> 11:26.300
- He grew up killing pigs!
- Bedwetting.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.500
No wonder he's fascinated
when i do that!

11:28.600 --> 11:30.800
And an inability to read
human facial queues!

11:30.900 --> 11:33.000
I admonished him
for that earlier!

11:33.200 --> 11:35.200
Three for three.
He's a monster!

11:35.300 --> 11:37.400
Okay, we've gotta go
tell jack.

11:37.700 --> 11:41.700
You know, if kenneth is actually
a killer, We're gonna be heroes.

11:47.300 --> 11:49.500
Liz, our food is gone.
They took it.

11:50.800 --> 11:51.800
It happened this morning.

11:51.900 --> 11:55.500
Do you have a cookie?
Mommy's baby needs his yum-Yums.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.800
Oh, my god.
Sid, did you get fired?

12:00.200 --> 12:02.000
Good-Bye, lerz.

12:03.700 --> 12:06.100
- Liz, it's a massacre!
- What is going on?

12:06.200 --> 12:08.000
Brad came in this morning
and started making cuts.

12:08.100 --> 12:09.700
I can't go back to
teaching high school math.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.900
Those girls pretend
they're not women yet, But they are.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.400
- Do something, liz.
- You're our only hope.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.800
Halster, you look hot in those trousers.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.500
how about we grab drinks tonight?

12:27.800 --> 12:30.600
Marissa, update my sched.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.100
Good morning, sir.

12:42.900 --> 12:46.200

But i need you to focus.

12:46.300 --> 12:47.500

Think before you speak.

12:49.700 --> 12:50.800

12:54.800 --> 12:56.100
Yes.

13:09.100 --> 13:11.200

13:12.400 --> 13:15.200

13:15.500 --> 13:18.100
- How may i help you?
- Um, we need to see jack.

13:18.200 --> 13:19.900
I don't know if i can allow that.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.300
I've made some mistakes lately.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.700
- Terrible mistakes.
- Uh-Huh.

13:24.800 --> 13:27.400
So i need to know
what this is about.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.400
I can't have you getting me
into trouble.

13:29.500 --> 13:30.600
It's not about you.

13:30.700 --> 13:32.100
Yeah,t'out someone else.

13:32.300 --> 13:35.700
I'm afraid this guy know in ca
Might be a serial killer.

13:35.800 --> 13:38.100

- Kenneth.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.100
I mean--I'll tell you his name.

13:40.800 --> 13:42.000
It's kenneth.

13:42.100 --> 13:43.500
Excellent. 

13:43.700 --> 13:49.500
I will be sure to let him know As soon as
he's done firing steven lee from microwaves.

13:49.600 --> 13:50.800
What?

13:50.900 --> 13:54.700
Oh, mr. Lee, i forgot.
He's ready for you now.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.200
I've got chills.
He's evil.

14:00.300 --> 14:02.300
If i had any doubts out this before,

14:02.300 --> 14:04.600
and i don't think i did,
they're gone now.

14:04.700 --> 14:06.600
We gotta go to his apartment
and save who we can.

14:07.100 --> 14:08.900
We're defitely gonna be heroes.

14:09.000 --> 14:12.400

in the pelican brief!

14:17.100 --> 14:19.300
Lee, i need that dress jenna
wore for the hooker sketch,

14:19.400 --> 14:21.800
The heels tracy wears
when he plays michelle obama,

14:21.900 --> 14:23.700
And double--Wait--

14:23.800 --> 14:25.400

No,the sluttier one.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.900
Thanks, liz.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.500
You're our hero.

14:45.100 --> 14:46.800
They may take my dignity,

14:47.000 --> 14:50.200
But they will never take our straws!

14:50.300 --> 14:52.600
Yeah!

14:55.300 --> 14:56.300
Oh, my god.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.800
Why does he have a rolled up towel
Against the bottom of the door?

14:58.900 --> 15:00.100
It's so creepy!

15:00.200 --> 15:04.900
Jenna, i just want you to know that
if we find Any human remains in there,

15:05.100 --> 15:07.700
I'm gonna throw up
all over your face.

15:15.700 --> 15:16.800
Oh, no!

15:16.800 --> 15:19.100
Kenneth's a murderer
and the riddler's coming!

15:19.200 --> 15:22.300
no. it's a bug bomb.
get out. get out.

15:22.400 --> 15:25.000
- It's poisonous. Ah!
- Ah!

15:28.700 --> 15:30.500
So thanks for dinner.

15:30.700 --> 15:33.000
- You sure know a lot about sushi.
- Well, you gotta be careful.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.100
They try to up-Sell you
the real crab.

15:35.900 --> 15:37.400
- So...
- so...

15:38.500 --> 15:41.900
list, i gotta get going.
i got a lotta work tomorrow.

15:43.700 --> 15:45.100
all right, listen,
we're both adults here.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.300
We know the deal.
Let's cut to the chase.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.700
That's certainly direct.

15:48.900 --> 15:52.400
We go upstairs.20 minutes.
Open mouth.I will work your ears.

15:52.500 --> 15:54.600
I don't know, liz. What you're
asking me to do is a big deal.

15:54.700 --> 15:56.800
If i go through with this,
i need to know it's worth it.

15:56.900 --> 15:58.900
Fine. 30 minutes.
I'll make some sounds.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.100
And you can say
one weird thing to me.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.700
All right, hardball.
30 minutes. sounds.

16:03.700 --> 16:05.900
Top front of my body is now
in play. Deal?

16:06.000 --> 16:07.200
Deal.

16:10.500 --> 16:14.400
Lemon, i heard a rumor that you went out
With one of the consultants last night.

16:14.500 --> 16:15.400
Well, i had no choice.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.300
I had to give him
a little taste of the lemon.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.900
And it was not sour,
my friend. Not sour.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.400
It's interesting
you put it that way

16:21.500 --> 16:24.000
Because your writers' room is now the headquarters

16:24.000 --> 16:27.000
For telemundo's coverage of
world cup soccer qualifying.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.000
<i>Equador tiene que ganar
o atar contra peru</i>

16:29.000 --> 16:30.300
<i>Para avanzar en los finales.</i>

16:30.400 --> 16:32.000
- What the what?!
- Ssh.

16:32.100 --> 16:35.400
Brad and i had a deal.
I gave him top front.

16:35.500 --> 16:38.800
Top front? Good lord, lemon,
that's your worst quadrant.

16:41.900 --> 16:45.400
Kenneth, you know how you told
tracy Not to into your bedroom?

16:45.600 --> 16:47.300
Well, naturally, we assumed
you were a serial killer.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.800
and as you can imagine,
your bird is dead.

16:49.900 --> 16:51.000
yeah, but on the bright side,

16:51.000 --> 16:54.100
You've been downgraded From
"suspect" to "person of interest."

16:54.200 --> 16:57.000
Some day, we're gonna
look back on this and laugh.

16:58.300 --> 17:00.500
time does heal all wounds!

17:02.100 --> 17:04.099
now you wait just one minute.

17:04.900 --> 17:08.900
I am sorry to be using my barn voice
In front of a lady, but i am riled up.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.800
it is not enough that you killed
the bird I've had for almost 60 years.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.000
But the fact that you didn't
trust me is unforgivable.

17:17.300 --> 17:18.700
But whd i expect?

17:18.700 --> 17:21.599
Look at you two walking around
without a care in the world

17:21.900 --> 17:23.599
As budgets are slashed

17:23.700 --> 17:27.300
And people keep getting called
into mr. Donaghy's office To be fired.

17:27.599 --> 17:30.800
I may just be a non-Special,

17:31.000 --> 17:34.300
But what you two did
is inexcusable.

17:34.500 --> 17:35.700
Good day.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.600
I'm out of letters.I have to
return my kids' braces.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.800
What did you do?
We trusted you!

17:42.900 --> 17:45.000
You ruined it
with your talking, didn't you?

17:45.100 --> 17:46.100
Hey!

17:46.100 --> 17:48.200
Why are you
still messing with my show?

17:48.400 --> 17:49.300
What about last night?

17:49.300 --> 17:52.200
Liz, last night was what it was,
But business is business.

17:52.300 --> 17:55.300
Right. And last night,
i gave you the business.

17:55.600 --> 17:59.100
We had an agreement.
Top front and some light ear work!

17:59.200 --> 18:01.400
You got your quid, halst
where's my quo?

18:01.500 --> 18:02.700
Oh, my god.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.800
Last night was about the show?

18:05.800 --> 18:07.300
Oh, please,
you know it was.

18:07.400 --> 18:09.100
You were all, oh,
it's gotta be worth it

18:09.200 --> 18:10.800
And what you're asking me to do
is such a big deal.

18:10.900 --> 18:12.200
It was a big deal.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.800
Being with a woman for the
first time since my wife died.

18:14.900 --> 18:17.900
- Ah, snap.
- It was just a transaction?

18:18.200 --> 18:19.200
What kind of person are you?!

18:19.200 --> 18:22.400
Does it help if i tell you I thought
we were doing sexual espionage?

18:22.500 --> 18:24.100
Oh, god.

18:24.500 --> 18:27.600
Sharon! Angel!

18:27.900 --> 18:30.700
i swore to you the next
one would be worthy, But she's not!

18:31.200 --> 18:32.900
she's a monster!

18:33.700 --> 18:37.000
Marissa, add dr. Walters
to my sched.

18:40.100 --> 18:41.500
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go.

18:41.600 --> 18:42.700
Okay

18:42.800 --> 18:46.800
so mr. Halster has filed a complaint
against you With human resources.

18:46.900 --> 18:53.200
Specifically, his claim suggests that you tried to barter
sex In exchange for professional consideration.

18:53.400 --> 18:57.400
In the human resource world, We refer to
that as "being a filthy prostitute."

18:57.500 --> 18:59.900
Now, since this is your first incident

19:00.000 --> 19:03.400
And, uh, mr. Donaghy has explained
The mitigating circumstances...

19:03.500 --> 19:07.300
I'm convinced that this sexual outburst
Was brought on by menopause.

19:07.400 --> 19:11.400
We are recommending only
a two-Week suspension Without pay.

19:11.600 --> 19:13.600
Okay. That's fair.

19:13.700 --> 19:17.000
and obviously mr. halster cannot
function In this hostile work environment.

19:17.100 --> 19:18.700
His company has reassigned him.

19:19.000 --> 19:24.000
And your budget review process
will start over again Under my supervision.

19:24.100 --> 19:25.800
- Really.
- Yes, really.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.000
I hope you've learned
your lesson, miss lemon.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.200
When you harass sexually
in the workplace,

19:30.200 --> 19:33.500
Things do not somehow
just work out in the end.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.600
Mr. Donaghy, i thought you'd like to know
That there's a spider on the printer.

19:39.400 --> 19:41.500
Oh, no.
Am i interrupting?

19:41.500 --> 19:43.600
Is this another firing meeting?

19:44.100 --> 19:45.200
It is now.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.400
Kenneth, have a seat.

19:57.100 --> 20:01.700
Ken, we feel bad that we--
But mostly jenna--Gassed your bird.

20:01.800 --> 20:02.800
I agree.

20:02.800 --> 20:06.800
Not to name names, but it's so sad That
a certain black individual Found it necessary

20:06.900 --> 20:10.100
to trick someone so pretty
Into believing you were a murderer.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.200
I'm sorry, is there
a point to all this?

20:12.300 --> 20:14.300
I've had a bad couple of days.

20:14.700 --> 20:17.800
Well, we feel terrible
about what happened,

20:17.800 --> 20:21.800
So we did a little something
to make it up to you.

20:33.400 --> 20:35.900
looks like i've got
some naming to do.

20:36.700 --> 20:40.100
Pat. Balthazar. Donna.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.500
lorne. michael.
