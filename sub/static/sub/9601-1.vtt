01:25.652 --> 01:26.846
Cotton.

01:27.821 --> 01:28.941
Well, what's this? I got him.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.108
No!

01:30.256 --> 01:31.944
- What's this?
- That would be a troublemaker,

01:32.092 --> 01:34.356
- a little troublemaker.
- You think you're going to church?

01:34.527 --> 01:36.715
- Yes.
- Jump in the shower, honey.

01:36.863 --> 01:40.060
We're going to church.
Going to church. We are going.

01:42.469 --> 01:44.494
Come on, come on, come on.

01:46.873 --> 01:49.569
Want to get the door? Thank you, Justin.

01:50.877 --> 01:51.964
Thanks.

01:52.112 --> 01:55.334
One of the most anointed men of God
that I think I've ever met in my life,

01:55.482 --> 01:57.402
- I think you know my son.
- Yeah.

01:57.550 --> 01:59.643
I think you know my son. Yeah.

02:06.526 --> 02:10.053
Reverend Cotton Marcus.
Let's give another hand for Jesus.

02:11.197 --> 02:12.617
<i>I started preaching pretty young.</i>

02:12.765 --> 02:15.854
<i>You know, my father was a preacher,
and every preacher has to have a hook</i>

02:16.002 --> 02:19.057
that's gonna bring the people in,
that's gonna get them saved

02:19.205 --> 02:22.094
and, well, frankly, get them in their wallet,
'cause a church doesn't run on love,

02:22.242 --> 02:24.596
<i>and, you know,
the child preacher was a great novelty.</i>

02:24.744 --> 02:26.798
<i>So, he started grooming me
in order to preach.</i>

02:26.946 --> 02:29.801
<i>Other kids were outside playing,
and I'd be learning the Gospel of John.</i>

02:29.949 --> 02:32.104
<i>And by the time he invited me up
on the pulpit one Sunday,</i>

02:32.252 --> 02:33.405
<i>you know, as a surprise,</i>

02:33.553 --> 02:35.340
to let the people know
and the congregation know

02:35.488 --> 02:37.956
that the Holy Spirit had visited his son,

02:38.858 --> 02:43.315
as spontaneous as that act
may have seemed to the congregation,

02:43.463 --> 02:45.454
we were ready.

02:45.865 --> 02:50.122
I'm saying right here, if you want an answer,
if you want to know...

02:50.270 --> 02:51.923
- Do you want to know?
- Yes!

02:52.071 --> 02:54.426
Look right here!
It's right here, brother. Right?

02:54.574 --> 02:56.461
<i>Well, Cotton is quite a character.</i>

02:56.609 --> 03:00.532
He's what you would call a performer,
a showman, a...

03:00.680 --> 03:01.733
He's a natural creative.

03:01.881 --> 03:06.138
<i>For example, we have a local theater here,
and Cotton writes plays,</i>

03:06.286 --> 03:08.206
<i>and he's making
these little mini movies now.</i>

03:08.354 --> 03:11.109
<i>He's built props for them, special effects.
Oh, my goodness.</i>

03:11.257 --> 03:13.979
I mean,
he entertains like nobody's business.

03:14.127 --> 03:16.114
And, you know, it starts here with us,

03:16.262 --> 03:18.457
<i>but, of course,
it carries on into his professional life.</i>

03:18.698 --> 03:21.186
Do you believe in Jesus Christ?
Yes, you do!

03:21.334 --> 03:23.755
<i>I mean, so many churches are boring.
People don't want to go,</i>

03:23.903 --> 03:26.371
<i>but when Cotton's there, it is never boring.</i>

03:27.040 --> 03:29.561
Folks, I'm here to tell you today
that the world is filled

03:29.709 --> 03:31.963
with many, many faces.

03:32.111 --> 03:33.465
- Amen.
- Amen.

03:33.613 --> 03:36.168
Right?
Now, some of those faces, they're good.

03:36.316 --> 03:37.936
They're right with God. Right?

03:38.084 --> 03:39.805
And some of those faces,
they're gonna lie to you.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.640
- You gotta watch out for them.
- Absolutely.

03:41.788 --> 03:42.808
So, I'm here to tell you today,

03:42.956 --> 03:44.676
make sure you don't fall for a pretty face,
all right?

03:44.824 --> 03:45.844
- Amen.
- Amen.

03:45.992 --> 03:49.894
'Cause that pretty face just may indeed be
the prince of lies.

03:50.997 --> 03:52.584
- That's right.
- Yeah.

03:52.732 --> 03:57.135
'Cause I'll tell you right now,
his lies are everywhere.

03:57.303 --> 03:58.857
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

03:59.005 --> 04:01.259
<i>It's all about rhythm.
And you get them going,</i>

04:01.407 --> 04:02.727
you hallelujah, and blood of Christ.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.262
- They love the blood, and...
- They love the blood?

04:04.410 --> 04:05.664
Yeah, I mean,
they're practically not listening.

04:05.812 --> 04:07.499
You get them in the right spot,
they're not even listening.

04:07.647 --> 04:08.700
- I mean...
- No, they're listening.

04:08.848 --> 04:11.303
No, they're so much so not listening,
I could talk about anything.

04:11.451 --> 04:15.107
I could talk about
my mom's banana bread recipe in the...

04:15.255 --> 04:16.274
- Oh, God, no.
- You don't think so?

04:16.422 --> 04:17.542
- See, now you're...
- You don't think so?

04:17.690 --> 04:18.710
No, you're underestimating your crowd.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.846
When I go back in there,
I will preach a banana bread sermon.

04:20.994 --> 04:23.224
- No, don't do that. That's embarrassing.
- I'll bet you 10 bucks.

04:23.429 --> 04:26.151
Do you believe that if you go ahead
and allow the Holy Ghost into your heart,

04:26.299 --> 04:28.753
you can be cleansed of all your sins
and sit in the kingdom of God?

04:28.901 --> 04:30.288
- Amen.
- That is what I'm talking about.

04:30.436 --> 04:31.823
- Can I get an amen?
- Amen.

04:31.971 --> 04:33.191
- Can I get a hallelujah?
- Hallelujah.

04:33.339 --> 04:35.527
- Can I get a hallelujah and an amen?
- Hallelujah, amen.

04:35.675 --> 04:37.929
Do you know if you take two ripe bananas,
you put them in a bowl,

04:38.077 --> 04:40.065
and you put some sugar
and you go ahead then bake it for 400,

04:40.213 --> 04:41.833
you can go and pull it out
and have yourself banana bread?

04:41.981 --> 04:43.735
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

04:43.883 --> 04:45.680
Hallelujah, yes, you can.

04:48.554 --> 04:50.715
Praise Jesus, praise Jesus.

04:51.124 --> 04:54.079
We're in my dad's office,
and actually, that's very special,

04:54.227 --> 04:55.819
'cause he doesn't let anybody in his office.

04:56.162 --> 04:57.782
Don't let them see the combination, Dad.

04:57.930 --> 04:59.261
I won't. Yeah.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.628
Yeah, please don't film this combination,
sir, it's...

05:03.736 --> 05:06.534
To be honest with you,
I'm the only one that knows it.

05:06.939 --> 05:08.627
Me and my accountant.

05:08.775 --> 05:11.229
This is the Hortus deliciarum.

05:11.377 --> 05:13.532
There are about 20 in the whole world.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.100
You can show it to them. Show it to them.

05:15.248 --> 05:19.685
This book describes
the various kinds of demons.

05:20.953 --> 05:22.374
Helps you identify them,

05:22.522 --> 05:27.479
and then recommends the process
for getting rid of that demon.

05:27.627 --> 05:33.395
We have had exorcists in our family
for generations.

05:33.933 --> 05:36.454
Generations. And, we...

05:36.602 --> 05:38.900
How many exorcisms you think
you've done with this book?

05:40.340 --> 05:44.276
Hundred and fifty.
Hundred and fifty exorcisms, yeah.

05:45.144 --> 05:49.034
The original story of Lucifer is this:
Lucifer, indeed, was an angel at one point.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.636
Some people say that he was actually
the choirmaster of heaven,

05:51.784 --> 05:54.940
<i>for lack of a better word.
He was helping raise hosannas to God,</i>

05:55.088 --> 05:57.042
<i>but he decided
he wanted the praise himself,</i>

05:57.190 --> 05:59.644
<i>and with that, God cast him out of heaven.</i>

05:59.792 --> 06:02.013
<i>He took a third of the host of heaven
with him,</i>

06:02.161 --> 06:04.282
<i>and those are your demons
that you have today.</i>

06:04.430 --> 06:07.219
<i>And then what you have, basically,
is the set-up of the entire Bible.</i>

06:07.367 --> 06:09.788
<i>You have the soul of man
being fought over.</i>

06:09.936 --> 06:13.158
<i>God wants you to turn to the light of him,
and Satan wants to grab your soul.</i>

06:13.306 --> 06:16.728
<i>Because ultimately Satan wants
to overthrow God, so you have this clash.</i>

06:16.876 --> 06:19.242
The Bible is filled with demons.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.466
If you believe in God,
you have to believe in the devil.

06:21.614 --> 06:22.867
Jesus himself was an exorcist.

06:23.015 --> 06:25.804
Therefore, if you are Christian
and you believe in the Bible

06:25.952 --> 06:29.820
and you believe in Jesus Christ,
you have to believe in demons.

06:31.624 --> 06:34.422
Mostly people contact me by my website.

06:35.795 --> 06:38.696
Yeah. But this, this is old school. Yeah.

06:42.034 --> 06:45.834
That's from Ivanwood. This is from Georgia.

06:48.074 --> 06:51.566
And this one says,
"Please open immediately. Urgent. "

06:54.113 --> 06:57.235
<i>Exorcism is alive and well
in the present age.</i>

06:57.383 --> 07:00.405
People think of it as being a scourge
of the Middle Ages

07:00.553 --> 07:03.575
that somehow went away
and was cured by science,

07:03.723 --> 07:05.744
but the fact of the matter is
it's never gone away.

07:05.892 --> 07:09.089
Exorcism today
is bigger than it's ever been.

07:09.529 --> 07:14.019
The Vatican used to have, like,
20 or 25 sanctioned exorcists on the staff.

07:14.167 --> 07:17.022
Now they have well over 300,
and that's just what they're telling us.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.524
And, you know,
they're not telling us everything.

07:19.672 --> 07:22.127
And that's just the Roman Catholic Church.

07:22.275 --> 07:23.895
They get all the press
'cause they got the movie,

07:24.043 --> 07:25.864
- and that's what's sort of culturally...
- Right.

07:26.012 --> 07:27.399
But the reality of it

07:27.547 --> 07:30.539
is that exorcisms are performed
by every religion all over the world.

07:35.688 --> 07:38.643
As a little boy, I thought this was
in every newspaper all over the world.

07:38.791 --> 07:39.883
Tell me what your dad does.

07:40.726 --> 07:45.561
He fights with the demons
and the vampires and all the ghosts

07:46.365 --> 07:48.128
and all the monsters.

07:48.601 --> 07:51.456
And fights all the ghosts
and the demons and the vampires?

07:51.604 --> 07:52.590
And the monsters.

07:52.738 --> 07:54.365
Do you believe in ghosts?

07:54.740 --> 07:57.038
Does your dad believe in ghosts?

08:03.115 --> 08:05.370
I do not believe in actual demons, no. No.

08:05.518 --> 08:09.614
But when I was doing exorcisms,
you know, I acted like I did.

08:09.889 --> 08:11.976
It's not like I saw any demons
come out of anybody.

08:12.124 --> 08:15.146
So, for the last something-odd years,
you've just been a fraud?

08:15.294 --> 08:17.382
That's your word, not mine.
I wouldn't say that.

08:17.530 --> 08:19.150
I would say that for the last couple of years,

08:19.298 --> 08:21.086
what I've been doing
is doing what I've always been doing,

08:21.234 --> 08:25.694
which is delivering a service for a person
who needs it in a way that they need it.

08:25.972 --> 08:27.025
I'm not saying I'm a doctor,

08:27.173 --> 08:30.462
but I am saying that I helped heal people
from what ailed them.

08:30.610 --> 08:33.064
And what ailed them sometimes
was the thought in their brain

08:33.212 --> 08:34.799
that they were possessed by a devil,

08:34.947 --> 08:39.537
and if I helped make that thought go away
and they felt better, so be it.

08:39.685 --> 08:43.382
<i>I got a life, I got a family to feed.
At least that's how I used to justify it.</i>

08:44.190 --> 08:46.978
<i>Well, basically, everything changed
when Justin was born.</i>

08:47.126 --> 08:50.515
<i>He was born early, and so there was
a while where we weren't sure</i>

08:50.663 --> 08:53.051
<i>our son was gonna be alive,</i>

08:53.199 --> 08:56.521
and then finally,
we found out that he was gonna be okay.

08:56.669 --> 08:59.691
And in that moment,
Cotton was so relieved,

08:59.839 --> 09:02.861
and he was just, like,
"We are so lucky, we are so lucky. "

09:03.009 --> 09:04.929
The best I can do is say,
"Thank you, Doctor," you know?

09:05.077 --> 09:07.532
I should have been thanking God,
but that wasn't my first thought.

09:07.680 --> 09:11.275
I mean, it just wasn't.
And that realization really shook me.

09:12.184 --> 09:14.239
<i>That was a real crisis of faith.</i>

09:14.387 --> 09:17.509
<i>I started to question whether I actually ever
even believed in God in the first place.</i>

09:17.657 --> 09:20.078
<i>I just... Boom, you know,
I started preaching so early and kept going.</i>

09:20.226 --> 09:21.880
<i>Yeah, I was good,
and I got rewarded for being good,</i>

09:22.028 --> 09:22.981
<i>and so who wants to stop that?</i>

09:23.129 --> 09:26.084
So, even when I started to have
this revelation

09:26.232 --> 09:27.519
of maybe I don't believe in God,

09:27.667 --> 09:31.689
and yet I'm still presenting myself
as a preacher, it didn't stop me.

09:31.837 --> 09:35.068
I mean, I was on autopilot. It's what I do.

09:36.509 --> 09:39.164
But it wasn't easy. You know, it got harder.
There's no doubt about that.

09:39.312 --> 09:42.577
He would have quit eventually,
at some point anyway,

09:43.282 --> 09:47.446
but there was this one story,
this little boy named Victor.

09:48.354 --> 09:51.221
His name was Victor Turoy,
from Harrisburg, Texas.

09:51.857 --> 09:53.645
<i>This little boy was autistic,</i>

09:53.793 --> 09:57.251
<i>and he was suffocated to death
during an exorcism,</i>

09:58.264 --> 10:01.486
with well-meaning people trying to get
this demon out of this child.

10:01.634 --> 10:05.623
I read that article and at the same time,
Justin was about this boy's age,

10:05.771 --> 10:08.092
and I started having
this recurring nightmare

10:08.240 --> 10:09.627
<i>where I was the exorcist</i>

10:09.775 --> 10:12.363
<i>and I was wrapping a plastic bag
around my own son's head.</i>

10:12.511 --> 10:15.166
I was watching my son die every night,
and I'd wake up in a cold sweat.

10:15.314 --> 10:18.603
It was not long after that,
I was in there washing dishes,

10:18.751 --> 10:19.904
and he came out of the office,

10:20.052 --> 10:22.885
<i>and he had this story about the new pope
opening an exorcism academy.</i>

10:23.222 --> 10:25.213
<i>I mean, he was visibly shaken,</i>

10:25.825 --> 10:29.347
and he said, "Do you know
how many more people this will hurt?"

10:29.495 --> 10:33.397
You know, and that's when
I really decided that I was done.

10:33.699 --> 10:36.654
I had to get out of that. I'm not interested
in participating in that whatsoever.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.156
I'm not participating in...

10:38.304 --> 10:43.361
What I want to do is expose exorcism
for the scam that it really is,

10:43.509 --> 10:44.629
and that's why we're doing this.

10:44.777 --> 10:46.798
So if I can help expose it for what it really is

10:46.946 --> 10:51.110
and save one kid from having
a plastic bag wrapped around his face,

10:52.084 --> 10:53.638
that sounds like God's work.

10:53.786 --> 10:55.773
What I thought we'd do
is that we will open an envelope

10:55.921 --> 10:58.009
and we will follow that request
wherever it takes us,

10:58.157 --> 11:01.012
and I'll let you follow me,

11:01.160 --> 11:05.597
and that way you can film
all the behind the scenes of my exorcism.

11:06.532 --> 11:10.054
Pick the one on top.
It's from Ivanwood, Louisiana.

11:10.202 --> 11:11.422
They're basically all the same.

11:11.570 --> 11:12.824
There's a whole bunch of people out there

11:12.972 --> 11:14.826
who are definitely convinced
that they are possessed.

11:14.974 --> 11:18.329
There's probably some sort of crop failure
or something wrong with the livestock.

11:18.477 --> 11:22.880
"I feel that I am dealing with a case
of possession by the devil himself. "

11:23.215 --> 11:26.116
"My livestock is being slaughtered nightly. "

11:27.620 --> 11:30.054
"Little doubt
that who is doing this gruesome... "

11:31.057 --> 11:32.243
"Please, please, please," right?

11:32.391 --> 11:34.450
Looks like we're going to Ivanwood.

11:36.562 --> 11:38.894
Get Daddy's candlesticks, okay?

11:41.500 --> 11:42.654
- I love you.
- You'll do great. Love you.

11:42.802 --> 11:43.860
Give me a hug.

11:44.103 --> 11:45.968
You just really...

11:52.778 --> 11:54.541
Bye, guys. Love you.

12:17.036 --> 12:19.724
It's amazing down here.
It's got a real unique feel.

12:19.872 --> 12:23.364
Nothing like it in any other part
of the country. And it's ancient.

12:24.310 --> 12:28.466
Some of the plantations here have been
standing for, you know, hundreds of years.

12:28.614 --> 12:31.769
And this is the only part of the country
that's been flown under six different flags,

12:31.917 --> 12:37.150
so it's a real mix of culture and superstition
and folklore down here.

12:38.357 --> 12:42.213
You've got voodoo, you've got
Roman Catholics, Pentecostalism,

12:42.361 --> 12:46.150
all these different beliefs, you know,
rubbing up against one another.

12:46.298 --> 12:49.426
And they're all looking to save you.
They're all looking to be the answer.

12:50.169 --> 12:52.123
There's a lot of illiteracy
and a lot of poverty,

12:52.271 --> 12:58.229
and between that
and the stopped-in-time feel of the place,

12:58.377 --> 13:04.247
it's like a perfect breeding ground
for demons and evil and...

13:14.293 --> 13:17.482
Can't fight the devil without the armor.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.827
Granted, it's linen, but it's hot down here.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.631
Sorry, sorry.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.029
Yeah, I'm gonna miss this.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.333
Maybe I'll sell real estate.

13:32.711 --> 13:35.441
Turning onto Louisiana Interstate 39.

13:40.452 --> 13:42.140
Down here, if you ask five people
about a demon story,

13:42.288 --> 13:43.841
they'll give you 10 demon stories.

13:43.989 --> 13:45.043
Yeah? We have time for that?

13:45.191 --> 13:46.818
Sure, absolutely.

13:48.394 --> 13:49.480
About 10 miles out of it.

13:49.628 --> 13:51.249
- Is Bush that way, as well?
- Yeah, Bush is that way there.

13:51.397 --> 13:52.850
- Okay.
- Be careful going down Bush.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.986
You hear so many things about that,
going out there.

13:55.134 --> 13:59.824
I think that the very gates to hell is right
over there, right off of Bush Drive.

13:59.972 --> 14:01.459
- Would you... Would you...
- The very gates to hell.

14:01.607 --> 14:03.561
There was a cult in this area,
and there was a temple.

14:03.709 --> 14:06.431
- A cult?
- It's not... Here, you... That's...

14:06.579 --> 14:08.166
Won't be able to describe
exactly where it is now,

14:08.314 --> 14:09.834
but when you get to the Sweetzer farm,

14:09.982 --> 14:11.302
they'll be able to give you specific...

14:11.450 --> 14:13.137
This guy that ran the cult

14:13.285 --> 14:18.576
was so disturbed that he actually thought

14:18.724 --> 14:24.749
that he would, like... He needed to,
like, feed, you know, feed human souls...

14:24.897 --> 14:26.451
- Sure.
... to the devil or whatever.

14:26.599 --> 14:27.998
Where's the UFO landing site at?

14:29.368 --> 14:32.098
That is actually in that direction.

14:56.595 --> 14:58.722
Maybe we could ask this guy.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.891
- No, he's stopping, he's stopping.
- He is?

15:04.036 --> 15:06.357
- Hey, afternoon.
- You guys making a movie?

15:06.505 --> 15:08.960
- A documentary, actually. How's it going?
- Great. I like documentaries.

15:09.108 --> 15:10.094
- Cool.
- Good.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.063
Well, we're looking for the Sweetzer farm.
Can you help us?

15:12.211 --> 15:13.898
- What was your name?
- Reverend Cotton Marcus.

15:14.046 --> 15:15.566
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

15:15.714 --> 15:17.335
- The Sweetzer farm, please?
- Yours?

15:17.483 --> 15:18.970
- I'm Iris. This is Daniel.
- Hey.

15:19.118 --> 15:21.405
Sorry, we're just a little behind schedule.
So...

15:21.553 --> 15:23.908
- No, no problem.
- The Sweetzer farm, please.

15:24.056 --> 15:25.710
Right.
Well, you're going the wrong direction.

15:25.858 --> 15:28.646
- You want to make a U-turn, actually.
- Okay.

15:28.794 --> 15:30.948
You want to take this road and go straight.

15:31.096 --> 15:33.084
You'll see things
you've already seen before. Keep on going.

15:33.232 --> 15:36.030
You're gonna hit the highway. Okay?

15:36.902 --> 15:40.167
And then I want you to go back
where you came from.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.626
Are you kidding?

15:41.774 --> 15:44.470
- No, I'm not kidding.
- Gotcha. Thank you.

15:47.913 --> 15:48.933
Sorry about that.

15:49.081 --> 15:50.635
- Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Jesus!

15:50.783 --> 15:52.003
What? What? Keep going!

15:52.151 --> 15:54.676
- What's he doing? What's he doing?
- Jesus Christ, just go! Go!

15:56.088 --> 15:57.542
You okay?

15:57.690 --> 15:58.782
Yeah.

16:02.261 --> 16:06.357
Seems like the end of the road.
Well, there's a tractor. That's a good sign.

16:07.466 --> 16:11.368
Here's a farmhouse of some sorts.
This has gotta be it.

16:22.147 --> 16:23.100
You know what?

16:23.248 --> 16:25.469
Let me just make sure it's him
before you guys get out. Okay?

16:25.617 --> 16:26.982
All right.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.477
- Mr. Sweetzer?
- Yeah.

16:33.625 --> 16:36.180
- How you doing? Cotton Marcus.
- It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

16:36.328 --> 16:38.950
Nice to meet you. Pardon my dress,
but it's a work day for me, too.

16:39.098 --> 16:40.918
No, no, no. That's...
I'm dressed for work myself.

16:41.066 --> 16:43.921
I understand that. Well, listen. I can't thank
you enough for coming out here.

16:44.069 --> 16:46.457
Absolutely. I reckon... I just figured...

16:46.605 --> 16:48.860
- Hey. Watch out for this kid.
- Hey.

16:49.008 --> 16:53.531
- We just met him on the road.
- Well, I apologize. That's my son, Caleb.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.366
- My apologies.
- No, what did he do?

16:55.514 --> 16:58.803
Well, you know,
it was probably just a misunderstanding.

16:58.951 --> 17:01.305
We asked for... Doesn't really matter.
Hi, good to see you again.

17:01.453 --> 17:03.674
Hi. Thank you so much.

17:03.822 --> 17:07.280
- What's your problem, boy?
- You know they got cameras?

17:09.528 --> 17:10.882
You got cameras?

17:11.030 --> 17:13.651
I was gonna tell you about that.
These are my friends. They came with me.

17:13.799 --> 17:15.987
- This is Iris and...
- Hi. Hi, how are you?

17:16.135 --> 17:17.722
- And Daniel.
- Hi.

17:17.870 --> 17:21.533
Appreciate it.
I'd like you to turn the camera off, though.

17:22.574 --> 17:24.195
Let's go ahead and just turn it off
for right now,

17:24.343 --> 17:25.529
and let's go talk about it, as a matter of fact.

17:25.677 --> 17:26.666
Yeah, great.

17:49.701 --> 17:52.156
This is the second bull I've lost.

17:52.304 --> 17:55.831
Two goats and, I don't know,
several chickens.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.662
Could this have come from an alligator?

17:57.810 --> 18:01.769
But an alligator,
they bite and roll and take chunks.

18:02.314 --> 18:04.902
Not a big, straight cut like that.

18:05.050 --> 18:06.570
You don't think
Caleb could have done this, do you?

18:06.718 --> 18:08.777
No. I'm sure it was Nell.

18:09.688 --> 18:11.679
- And Nell is?
- My daughter.

18:13.292 --> 18:16.591
Right. I knew that.
I remember that from the letter.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.549
I should have read the letter
a little more thoroughly.

18:18.697 --> 18:23.361
I thought it was Louis, not Nell.
I don't like working with kids.

18:24.303 --> 18:25.823
That's from last night.

18:25.971 --> 18:28.906
One just like this
every time I lose an animal.

18:31.910 --> 18:33.664
- She doesn't remember this?
- No, sir.

18:33.812 --> 18:36.367
She doesn't remember anything.

18:36.515 --> 18:41.248
And so it really frightened her a lot,
and so I just quit asking her about it.

18:42.221 --> 18:44.382
- Hello. Is that Nell?
- Hi. Yes.

18:44.890 --> 18:46.510
Hello, Reverend Marcus.

18:46.658 --> 18:47.845
- Nice to meet you.
- So nice to meet you.

18:47.993 --> 18:48.946
- Thank you for coming up.
- Hi.

18:49.094 --> 18:51.722
- Hi.
- Just... Can you come this way?

18:53.565 --> 18:55.519
This is my room.

18:55.667 --> 18:57.388
- Did you do those?
- Yeah.

18:57.536 --> 18:59.800
- Wonderful.
- Thank you.

19:00.172 --> 19:04.302
And this is actually
the story of Esther of Antioch.

19:04.710 --> 19:09.443
She's not from the Bible.
It was something I dreamed of.

19:10.382 --> 19:12.336
- Yeah.
- All this artwork and detail,

19:12.484 --> 19:15.006
it's really well thought out.
I'm very, very impressed.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.883
Well, that's...

19:17.322 --> 19:19.844
So, I just want to, you know,
if you don't mind, Nell,

19:19.992 --> 19:22.146
tell me how you're feeling.
Tell me what's been going on.

19:22.294 --> 19:24.448
Your dad told me about the livestock.

19:24.596 --> 19:26.484
What do you know about that?

19:26.632 --> 19:31.069
Well, I can only think one thing,
that I killed them.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.532
Do you remember killing them?

19:35.541 --> 19:37.361
- No, but...
- Do you remember getting out of bed?

19:37.509 --> 19:39.063
Do you remember walking down the stairs?

19:39.211 --> 19:41.599
- Do you remember walking outside?
- No.

19:41.747 --> 19:44.869
Do you remember doing anything
to the animals at all?

19:45.017 --> 19:46.037
No, but...

19:46.185 --> 19:49.211
Well, then maybe you didn't do
anything at all.

19:49.688 --> 19:52.748
As I mentioned in my letter,
my wife died two years ago.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.179
It was cancer,

19:55.327 --> 19:59.350
and she was being treated,
we thought successfully, for breast cancer,

19:59.498 --> 20:03.888
and then six months later,
it metastasized into her bones,

20:04.036 --> 20:06.698
<i>and three weeks after that she was gone.</i>

20:06.872 --> 20:09.960
<i>It was quite a shock, especially for Nell.
I mean, she was 14 years old.</i>

20:10.108 --> 20:13.264
<i>Just coming into young womanhood,
and so it was very difficult.</i>

20:13.412 --> 20:15.633
I saw that picture downstairs.
You look just like your mother.

20:15.781 --> 20:16.767
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:16.915 --> 20:18.803
- Yeah, I saw the painting downstairs.
- Thank you so much.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.038
That's such a compliment.
She's so beautiful.

20:21.186 --> 20:22.973
She is. Well, so is her daughter, so...

20:23.121 --> 20:24.575
Thank you so much. Thank you, sir.

20:24.723 --> 20:27.912
- Were you very close? Plus being a mom.
- Yeah, she was my best friend.

20:28.060 --> 20:31.359
Yeah. That's safe to say.
She was my best friend.

20:33.899 --> 20:37.062
Did Caleb act any different
after your mom passed?

20:37.469 --> 20:39.664
I think Caleb got frustrated.

20:40.072 --> 20:43.235
He got kind of scary.
He started hating God a lot.

20:44.209 --> 20:46.664
How about your father? How has he been
affected since she's been gone?

20:46.812 --> 20:48.780
It hit him very hard.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.572
It hit him...

20:52.517 --> 20:56.440
If it weren't for my wife, Delle,
and the faith that she instilled in me,

20:56.588 --> 20:58.876
I don't think I would have made it through.

20:59.024 --> 21:02.680
So, since she died,
I have been very determined

21:02.828 --> 21:06.317
to give my children
a more fundamental Christian upbringing.

21:06.465 --> 21:11.589
<i>I'm not real crazy about the influences
that exist in the world today,</i>

21:11.737 --> 21:15.264
and therefore I decided
to home-school Nell.

21:16.108 --> 21:19.597
For a while, I let her go
to the Sunday school at our local church,

21:19.745 --> 21:22.399
but that just didn't seem right, either.

21:22.547 --> 21:25.903
Pastor Manley didn't really teach
only religious music.

21:26.051 --> 21:28.305
So, that's why he pulled me out.

21:28.453 --> 21:29.707
Your dad likes religious music then?

21:29.855 --> 21:31.442
Yeah. Yeah.

21:31.590 --> 21:35.179
I've tried keeping her
as close as I possibly could,

21:35.327 --> 21:39.127
maybe even a little too protective.
I'll admit to that.

21:40.032 --> 21:45.766
But somehow, still, the devil got in her.

21:49.308 --> 21:53.369
<i>Her mother gave her a small crucifix,
and it burns her.</i>

21:54.179 --> 21:57.148
<i>The symbol of our Lord,
and she can't wear it.</i>

22:05.090 --> 22:09.246
I don't know if it's Nell
who's going around killing those animals.

22:09.394 --> 22:12.516
I know she's really isolated out here.
That's gotta drive you crazy.

22:12.664 --> 22:16.387
But the burning cross,
that's just like a nickel allergy.

22:16.535 --> 22:19.470
You get a reaction like that on your skin,
especially if you're stressed out.

22:24.976 --> 22:26.238
Hey, son.

22:26.812 --> 22:27.765
Hi.

22:27.913 --> 22:30.404
Why were you throwing rocks at me?

22:33.018 --> 22:35.573
Are you still gonna perform an exorcism?

22:35.721 --> 22:39.350
An exorcism? Well, I don't know.
That's what I'm here to find out.

22:41.893 --> 22:45.624
'Cause, apparently, there's deaths involved
and people have died.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.618
Well, if you're worried
about something like that,

22:47.766 --> 22:50.221
I'm here to go ahead and assure you
nothing like that happens with me.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.822
I'm here to help.

22:51.970 --> 22:53.857
We don't need your help, though.

22:54.005 --> 22:56.460
Well, your livestock do.
They seem to be dying left and right.

22:56.608 --> 22:57.761
You know anything about that?

22:57.909 --> 23:00.164
I know my father's a superstitious drunk.

23:00.312 --> 23:02.299
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:02.447 --> 23:06.270
Well, do you think he's superstitious
or drunk enough to harm his own animals?

23:06.418 --> 23:08.906
It's possible, you know. I don't know.

23:09.054 --> 23:11.041
Do you think
Nell had anything to do with it?

23:11.189 --> 23:14.178
No, I don't. I don't think Nell's the problem.

23:14.326 --> 23:15.879
Nell doesn't need help.

23:16.027 --> 23:17.281
Well, I...
That remains to be seen, now, doesn't it?

23:17.429 --> 23:20.718
If anything happens to her,
I will hurt you, okay?

23:20.866 --> 23:23.287
And I don't care if the camera's watching.

23:23.435 --> 23:26.632
Okay? It can watch all it wants.
I will hurt you.

23:29.141 --> 23:31.302
- Thank you.
- Thank you, son.

23:32.611 --> 23:33.908
Thank you.

23:35.480 --> 23:36.900
There you go. Nice and relaxed.

23:37.048 --> 23:38.402
- You're not nervous, are you?
- No.

23:38.550 --> 23:41.705
Okay, 'cause you can't be nervous
when I do this.

23:41.853 --> 23:44.008
- Okay. Let's try again. There you go.
- Okay.

23:44.156 --> 23:45.609
- Feel any pressure?
- A little.

23:45.757 --> 23:47.054
You do?

23:48.894 --> 23:51.548
Well, my throat's been a little sore
'cause I've been waking up screaming.

23:51.696 --> 23:53.250
So, you have a sore throat, as well?

23:53.398 --> 23:55.619
Well, just 'cause I've been waking
up screaming, like I said before.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.655
That's all right.
There's nothing to be nervous about.

23:57.803 --> 24:01.392
It's absolutely fine.
Night sweats and night fevers

24:01.540 --> 24:05.362
and the loss of appetite
and fatigue in the afternoon and...

24:05.510 --> 24:07.000
- Whoa.
- What?

24:08.146 --> 24:10.239
- What?
- An...

24:10.849 --> 24:11.902
What?

24:12.050 --> 24:14.518
Let me have your finger. Come here.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.974
Right back here. Can you feel that?

24:17.122 --> 24:19.352
Right there, that indention?
Nell, look straight ahead, please.

24:22.260 --> 24:24.381
Have you always had it this deep?

24:24.529 --> 24:26.784
- Have you guys checked this at all?
- I guess it's deeper now, but...

24:26.932 --> 24:27.918
Yeah, it's a lot deeper now.

24:28.066 --> 24:31.889
Louis, would you get me a pan of water
big enough to go ahead and put her feet in.

24:32.037 --> 24:34.458
- Pan of water. Excuse me.
- Yeah.

24:34.606 --> 24:37.227
I need you to take
your socks and shoes off, okay?

24:37.375 --> 24:39.029
Very pretty shoes you got.

24:39.177 --> 24:40.474
Thank you.

24:43.949 --> 24:46.679
I like your shoes. They're real nifty.

24:47.219 --> 24:49.687
Want to try them on? Here you go.

24:52.657 --> 24:53.911
Hey, they look good on you.

24:54.059 --> 24:55.379
They look...

24:55.527 --> 24:56.480
They're yours.

24:56.628 --> 24:58.282
- No way, Miss Iris.
- Yeah, yeah. Don't worry about it.

24:58.430 --> 25:00.284
- I got a pair of Converse in the car.
- No, please. I mean...

25:00.432 --> 25:03.554
You look good in them, and I'm sure
you can't find them in 300-mile radius, so...

25:03.702 --> 25:06.590
Oh my, Miss Iris. This is the nicest thing
that's ever happened.

25:06.738 --> 25:08.899
Dad, look. Miss Iris gave me her boots.

25:09.274 --> 25:13.764
Well, let's take them off your feet right now.
How about that for starters?

25:13.912 --> 25:15.504
There you go.

25:17.215 --> 25:18.902
Okay, lift them up.

25:19.050 --> 25:22.806
Let's all close our eyes for a moment.
Let's all close our eyes and pray to Jesus

25:22.954 --> 25:25.286
to help us out
in this time of need right now.

25:25.957 --> 25:30.485
Oh, Lord, we ask you
to please give us your strength,

25:32.163 --> 25:35.352
give us your hope and give us your clarity.
Please help us.

25:35.500 --> 25:38.856
We ask you to please take care of Nell,

25:39.004 --> 25:43.160
and in this test, may you please show us
an unadulterated sign

25:43.308 --> 25:45.362
of whether or not we should continue
upon this way,

25:45.510 --> 25:47.698
if we should go ahead and indeed find out
whether we should

25:47.846 --> 25:50.906
- continue down the path...
- Reverend Marcus.

26:00.292 --> 26:01.945
Is this regular water?

26:02.093 --> 26:03.082
Yes.

26:05.263 --> 26:07.527
That's the temperature change.

26:08.466 --> 26:12.527
I was afraid of this.
We will proceed with the exorcism.

26:16.141 --> 26:17.506
It's okay.

26:19.044 --> 26:23.003
I'm afraid that I suspect that Nell
is possessed with a demon named...

26:24.149 --> 26:25.269
"Abalam. "

26:25.417 --> 26:26.475
Abalam.

26:28.053 --> 26:30.207
What is this? What is...
What kind of language is this part?

26:30.355 --> 26:32.843
- Do you not read Latin?
- No, sir.

26:32.991 --> 26:34.511
- It's all right. I got it for you.
- So...

26:34.659 --> 26:36.217
What this tells us is...

26:37.896 --> 26:39.817
Abalam. Inside. Abalam.

26:39.965 --> 26:41.557
- Right there. See, you can see.
- Right, right.

26:43.468 --> 26:45.556
What it says is he's very powerful.

26:45.704 --> 26:48.158
He is perhaps the most powerful being
in the entire book.

26:48.306 --> 26:49.359
What he does is like a snake.

26:49.507 --> 26:52.965
He wraps himself around the coil,
the soul of the person,

26:53.578 --> 26:55.199
and that is why
there's the temperature fluctuation,

26:55.347 --> 26:57.334
up, down, like Nell was showing.

26:57.482 --> 27:02.419
The thing about Abalam is that he preys
on the flesh of the innocent.

27:03.922 --> 27:06.443
He defiles the flesh of the innocent.

27:06.591 --> 27:08.786
- That is what he does.
- Defile?

27:09.494 --> 27:11.189
And it's particularly bad
when he's in young girls.

27:12.397 --> 27:13.864
Look at him.

27:14.633 --> 27:20.868
It says right here that the possessed's
only salvation will come in death.

27:22.574 --> 27:25.543
What? The only salvation is death?

27:26.511 --> 27:28.445
Unless she is exorcised.

27:30.248 --> 27:31.738
You're a fraud.

27:33.718 --> 27:35.481
Hello, Caleb.

27:37.355 --> 27:39.585
You threw something in there.

27:40.525 --> 27:43.914
I saw you. But I won't tell, okay?

27:44.062 --> 27:46.758
I don't know what you're talking about.

27:48.033 --> 27:49.796
That was really good.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.766
We don't have any problems now.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.430
This will shake nicely.

29:13.918 --> 29:15.112
Come in.

29:21.192 --> 29:23.558
Come now. Stand here for a second.

29:25.096 --> 29:28.452
Caleb, if you would, over there.
Louis, beside her.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.754
Nell, go ahead. Get on the bed.

29:30.902 --> 29:36.033
You can sit or you can lay down.
Whatever makes you comfortable.

29:41.312 --> 29:42.566
Are you comfortable?

29:42.714 --> 29:45.402
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Nothing to be nervous about.

29:45.550 --> 29:47.904
Gentlemen, I do not need your help
unless I ask for it.

29:48.052 --> 29:49.339
I ask you to respectfully stay over there.

29:49.487 --> 29:51.742
What I need from you gentlemen
is your faith.

29:51.890 --> 29:55.145
- Yes, sir.
- Your courage and your love.

29:55.293 --> 29:59.650
Because why we are here is because
we love Nell, and we want Nell to get better.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.852
- Isn't that right?
- Yes, Reverend.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.588
Well, then let's do that. Let's start
by praying to the Lord, our God above.

30:04.736 --> 30:06.390
Please, let us close our eyes.

30:06.538 --> 30:08.725
"Beside restful waters, he leads me.
He refreshes my soul.

30:08.873 --> 30:11.495
"He guides me in the right paths,
for his namesake.

30:11.643 --> 30:14.831
"Even though I walk in the dark valley,
I shall fear no evil,

30:14.979 --> 30:18.535
"for you are by my side with your rod
and your staff that give me courage. "

30:18.683 --> 30:20.103
- Do you have courage, Nell?
- Yes, sir.

30:20.251 --> 30:21.772
- Do you believe in Jesus Christ, Nell?
- Yes, sir.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.573
Do you believe
that Jesus can get this demon out of you?

30:23.721 --> 30:26.043
- Yes, sir.
- Then let him expel the demon from you.

30:26.191 --> 30:28.278
I say, demon, begone,
in the name of Jesus Christ.

30:28.426 --> 30:31.114
I say, demon, cast yourself out.
Leave this girl.

30:31.262 --> 30:34.184
In the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord,
and the blood that washes over her,

30:34.332 --> 30:35.719
I say, demon, begone!

30:35.867 --> 30:38.062
I command thee to begone!

30:40.572 --> 30:45.509
No, demon. Don't listen.
Pay no attention. Don't listen at all.

30:47.912 --> 30:50.437
No. No, no.

30:52.183 --> 30:53.303
- Don't worry.
- Hey.

30:53.451 --> 30:56.181
Don't listen to that, Louis. Pay no attention.

30:57.155 --> 31:00.043
Pay no attention! For he is the father of lies.

31:00.191 --> 31:03.246
All he knows are lies,
where all we know, the father of love.

31:03.394 --> 31:04.448
- Oh, my God.
- The prince of peace.

31:04.596 --> 31:06.950
- Our Father who art in heaven...
- The God above who shall save you all.

31:07.098 --> 31:08.752
...please, please!
- Save you all, save you all

31:08.900 --> 31:12.336
by the power, by the power,
name and authority of Jesus Christ, as it...

31:12.837 --> 31:15.459
Sound is so important. Got my player.

31:15.607 --> 31:19.441
I go ahead and program
over 800 different demon sounds.

31:24.983 --> 31:27.070
Trust in the Lord. The Lord shall save you.

31:27.218 --> 31:29.005
- Reverend, the...
- The Lord shall provide for you.

31:29.153 --> 31:31.141
- Reverend, he is here! He's here!
- The laws of our God.

31:31.289 --> 31:33.777
Do you believe in Christ?
Do you believe that Christ shall heal you?

31:33.925 --> 31:36.213
Do you believe that Christ
can heal you, Nell? Can Christ heal you?

31:36.361 --> 31:38.148
- Yes, Christ can heal me.
- Then be healed!

31:38.296 --> 31:40.684
That's right. Be healed! Be healed.

31:40.832 --> 31:41.952
- Say, I love Jesus.
- I love Jesus!

31:42.100 --> 31:44.354
Say that I love Jesus! I love Jesus Christ.

31:44.502 --> 31:46.868
Believe in Christ Jesus, be saved. Saved!

31:47.038 --> 31:50.927
These are two 9-volt batteries,
and attached are wires at the end.

31:51.075 --> 31:54.197
And then you go ahead and run
one of the wires down the sleeve,

31:54.345 --> 31:55.365
and then you attach it right in there.

31:55.513 --> 32:00.270
Believe, believe! Believe, believe, believe!

32:00.418 --> 32:01.817
Oh, my God...

32:02.120 --> 32:05.021
In the name of Jesus Christ,
I command thee to leave!

32:06.090 --> 32:08.923
In the blood of Christ, demon, get thee out!

32:13.564 --> 32:14.929
I can't do it.

32:16.901 --> 32:19.563
You have to. You have to.

32:22.707 --> 32:25.462
God, take me!
Take the demon from this girl.

32:25.610 --> 32:29.800
Grant me thy will, O Lord!
Take the demon, O Lord!

32:29.948 --> 32:31.711
Let me take the demon!

32:40.291 --> 32:41.724
- Praise God.
- Oh, God.

32:42.593 --> 32:43.680
<i>The demon is gone.</i>

32:43.828 --> 32:44.815
<i>Are you okay?</i>

32:44.963 --> 32:49.252
<i>The demon is gone. The demon could not
withstand the sign of our Lord!</i>

32:49.400 --> 32:50.731
<i>Praise God!</i>

32:59.277 --> 33:00.676
You're okay?

33:09.387 --> 33:12.413
- How's she doing? Yeah.
- She's sleeping like a child.

33:13.157 --> 33:14.522
With a little smile on her face.

33:15.159 --> 33:16.780
That's fantastic.

33:16.928 --> 33:20.022
- It's all there?
- There's no reason to count it.

33:23.468 --> 33:24.988
Thank you. Take care.

33:25.136 --> 33:27.791
- Thank you all. Thank you.
- What?

33:27.939 --> 33:31.705
- No, I was just saying thank you.
- What? I can't hear you.

33:33.044 --> 33:34.739
Reverend?

33:35.279 --> 33:37.213
I don't understand.

33:38.149 --> 33:39.377
Reverend.

33:41.219 --> 33:43.881
The Lord has a prophecy for you, Louis.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.844
The Lord says he knows your pain.

33:47.992 --> 33:50.714
He knows
that you're sad for your wife to be gone.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.729
The Lord says, rejoice for she is with him.

33:54.332 --> 33:55.952
The Lord does not want
you to bottle it up inside.

33:56.100 --> 33:58.388
The Lord does not want you to stuff
your anger and your sorrow

33:58.536 --> 34:00.023
and your burden into this bottle
and drink from it.

34:00.171 --> 34:01.625
- No, sir.
- He does not want you to do that.

34:01.773 --> 34:04.294
- No, sir, no. Lord, I won't.
- He does not want you to hide.

34:04.442 --> 34:07.097
- I won't.
- He wants you to smash that bottle,

34:07.245 --> 34:10.100
and in its place,
he wants you to accept love.

34:10.248 --> 34:12.035
He wants you to accept the Lord's love.

34:12.183 --> 34:14.549
I will. Thank you, Lord.

34:14.986 --> 34:17.045
That was highly impressive.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.516
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

34:19.857 --> 34:21.848
Much more than I expected.

34:31.669 --> 34:33.023
- Hey, Louis.
- Yes, sir.

34:33.171 --> 34:34.591
Now, just remember.

34:34.739 --> 34:38.461
I took the devil out of your house,
but it's your job to keep him out.

34:38.609 --> 34:40.463
Yes, sir, I'll do that.

34:40.611 --> 34:42.666
Now, listen. You sure
I can't convince y'all to stay with us?

34:42.814 --> 34:44.167
No, no, no. Thank you for your hospitality.

34:44.315 --> 34:45.902
We're gonna find a motel up the road.

34:46.050 --> 34:47.381
- All right.
- Take care.

34:54.392 --> 34:57.814
She did? Well, why don't you put her on?

34:57.962 --> 35:01.918
Can you do that for me?
I love you, too. Brush your teeth.

35:02.066 --> 35:03.158
Brush them.

35:03.801 --> 35:07.100
Justin said you were crying. Is that true?
What's going on?

35:11.642 --> 35:13.563
We're paid up on that.
He needs a new hearing aid.

35:13.711 --> 35:16.509
We are paid up on that. I am sure of it.

35:18.382 --> 35:19.974
Who's Cassandra?

35:20.518 --> 35:23.180
You know,
I used to want to have a TV ministry.

35:24.489 --> 35:26.457
I thought that'd be cool.

35:28.860 --> 35:32.387
And now, frankly,
all I really want is health insurance.

35:34.198 --> 35:36.419
- You got what you needed today?
- Yes, really, really awesome stuff.

35:36.567 --> 35:39.331
- Thank you. You have a good night.
- All right.

35:39.604 --> 35:42.164
- Good night, good night.
- Good night.

36:17.408 --> 36:18.995
What is she doing here?
What is she doing here?

36:19.143 --> 36:20.964
- I don't know.
- What can I do?

36:21.112 --> 36:22.799
I don't know. She hasn't said a word.

36:22.947 --> 36:24.901
Nell? Can you hear me?

36:25.049 --> 36:26.469
She hasn't responded
to anything I've said so far.

36:26.617 --> 36:28.505
- Where's her dad?
- I have no idea. That's why I called you.

36:28.653 --> 36:31.107
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I woke up. She was standing here.

36:31.255 --> 36:33.476
- Nell. Nell.
- Daniel, stay back, okay?

36:33.624 --> 36:35.114
I think she's bleeding.

36:37.161 --> 36:39.493
Nell, are you okay? Honey?

36:44.569 --> 36:46.264
Honey, can you hear me?

36:50.675 --> 36:53.463
Okay, be gentle with her.
I'm gonna call her dad.

36:53.611 --> 36:56.205
Honey, can you tell us how you got here?

37:08.259 --> 37:09.521
Honey.

37:11.362 --> 37:13.660
I'm not getting any answer here.

37:18.803 --> 37:20.134
Nell, stop.

37:21.138 --> 37:23.606
Okay. No, we need to get her to a hospital.

37:27.445 --> 37:31.609
Nell. Nell. Oh, my God.

37:39.190 --> 37:42.745
I've seen people react, but not 10 hours
after the fact in my hotel room.

37:42.893 --> 37:44.481
Their farm is 5 miles away from the hotel,

37:44.629 --> 37:47.117
and how did she even know
where I was staying?

37:47.265 --> 37:48.857
And that's why I don't work with kids.

37:49.033 --> 37:50.720
Is there a doctor around?
We have a little girl who's sick.

37:50.868 --> 37:53.056
Well, yes, but what...
Hey, where are you going with that camera?

37:53.204 --> 37:54.157
- Sorry. He's with me.
- He's with us.

37:54.305 --> 37:56.693
Okay, well, he can't be with you.
He's gonna have to turn the camera off.

37:56.841 --> 37:58.428
- Okay, well, he's not gonna shoot inside.
- That's fine.

37:58.576 --> 38:00.697
As a matter of fact,
I need him to turn it off and take it outside.

38:00.845 --> 38:03.066
- We don't allow filming in here.
- Okay, okay. All right, that's fine.

38:03.214 --> 38:04.300
I understand. No problem. We'll turn it off.

38:04.448 --> 38:05.568
What part of turn the camera off
do you not get?

38:05.716 --> 38:07.650
Take the camera outside
or I'm going to call security.

38:10.187 --> 38:11.677
Excuse me, sir?

38:13.124 --> 38:14.421
Thank you.

38:14.959 --> 38:17.347
- Is that the doctor?
- Yes, but that camera is turned off?

38:17.495 --> 38:19.360
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yes, yes.

38:19.830 --> 38:22.152
Well, it looks like we got
most of the blood tests back...

38:22.300 --> 38:24.354
- And?
... and everything appears to be normal.

38:24.502 --> 38:26.956
So, what we're gonna do
is let her continue to rest right now.

38:27.104 --> 38:29.125
Can you run
some sort of psychiatric tests on her?

38:29.273 --> 38:31.227
No, we'd have to have
the parents' permission to do that.

38:31.375 --> 38:32.428
Now, what we're gonna do is,

38:32.576 --> 38:34.168
we're gonna wait
for the rest of the tests to come back.

38:46.590 --> 38:48.044
This is Mr. Sweetzer.

38:48.192 --> 38:49.479
Louis Sweetzer, I'd like to see my daughter.

38:49.627 --> 38:52.081
- This is the father.
- Mr. Sweetzer, if you can wait just a minute,

38:52.229 --> 38:53.616
let me see
if I can get in touch with the doctor.

38:53.764 --> 38:54.984
- So, this is...
- She was standing, babbling,

38:55.132 --> 38:56.352
- then she was lying on the bed.
- Well...

38:56.500 --> 38:58.254
You watched her do all this?
Why didn't you call?

38:58.402 --> 39:00.857
I did call you, but nobody answered.

39:01.005 --> 39:04.427
Louis, I feel very strongly that she needs to
have some professional take a look at her.

39:04.575 --> 39:05.695
- She's a young girl. A doctor...
- Excuse me.

39:05.843 --> 39:07.363
- Yeah? Pardon me.
- Mr. Sweetzer.

39:07.511 --> 39:08.631
Thank you.
If you could sign this and give me...

39:08.779 --> 39:09.766
What is this?

39:09.914 --> 39:11.334
That's gonna be
a release for your daughter.

39:11.482 --> 39:14.037
This is just for release.
It's not about any tests or anything?

39:14.185 --> 39:15.138
- No, sir.
- Do you have the form

39:15.286 --> 39:17.173
that he could sign
in order to get psychiatric tests?

39:17.321 --> 39:19.375
- Can we have that?
- Mr. Sweetzer hasn't asked for any forms.

39:19.523 --> 39:20.843
- Louis, how do you get... Since we're here.
- No.

39:20.991 --> 39:23.016
- I'll let him talk to the doctor.
- Please, you didn't...

39:23.260 --> 39:25.515
It looked like
the sort of thing for a young girl,

39:25.663 --> 39:28.952
- considering what she's been through...
- I think we know what Nell...

39:29.100 --> 39:30.590
Mr. Sweetzer.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.822
Nell, how you doing?

39:32.970 --> 39:35.325
Do you remember
being at the hotel last night?

39:35.473 --> 39:38.695
- Did you know you were at his hotel?
- I think so.

39:38.843 --> 39:40.663
Do you want to wait and talk to the doctor,
Mr. Sweetzer?

39:40.811 --> 39:42.244
No, I don't.

39:48.352 --> 39:50.406
What happened, Reverend?
That's the question.

39:50.554 --> 39:52.709
Well, I believe that the demon is gone.

39:52.857 --> 39:55.178
It's as if Nell's house had been vandalized.

39:55.326 --> 39:58.781
The robber is gone, but we need somebody
else to put things right again...

39:58.929 --> 40:01.751
No, don't slough it off
to the big city doctor thing.

40:01.899 --> 40:04.187
Eight of them could not save my wife.

40:04.335 --> 40:07.600
Eight of them could not prolong her life
one day.

40:08.038 --> 40:11.461
And psychiatry? Psychiatry is not of God.

40:11.609 --> 40:13.463
Louis, the tools that God provides for us

40:13.611 --> 40:17.233
<i>sometimes are not always the tools
that we recognize or the tools...</i>

40:17.381 --> 40:19.849
"Our weapons of war are not carnal.

40:20.351 --> 40:24.048
"They are mighty in God
for the pulling down of strongholds. "

40:24.488 --> 40:27.243
Am I right? Am I right?

40:27.391 --> 40:32.385
- Yes, yes, yes. Absolutely. Amen to that.
- That's what we're dealing with, Reverend.

40:32.630 --> 40:36.819
He's stuck on this idea that
I'm some sort of slick, big city preacher.

40:36.967 --> 40:38.798
He's not gonna listen to anything
I have to say.

40:39.270 --> 40:40.999
Let's get somebody local.

40:43.307 --> 40:45.741
It's got to be that one over there.

40:48.712 --> 40:49.766
- Hi.
- Good afternoon,

40:49.914 --> 40:51.467
I'm Reverend Cotton Marcus
from Baton Rouge.

40:51.615 --> 40:53.169
- Hi, I'm Becky.
- Nice to meet you, Becky.

40:53.317 --> 40:54.737
- From where?
- Baton Rouge.

40:54.885 --> 40:57.407
- Okay.
- I'm looking for Pastor Manley,

40:57.555 --> 40:59.989
- if he's around by any chance.
- Yes, he's right back there.

41:00.591 --> 41:03.719
- What are you all doing?
- We're making a movie.

41:04.862 --> 41:09.094
- So, are you all shooting this now?
- Yeah.

41:09.433 --> 41:12.061
- So, will I be in it?
- Yeah, you will.

41:13.037 --> 41:15.925
- Pastor Manley, we've got us some visitors.
- All right.

41:16.073 --> 41:18.561
Afternoon, Reverend Cotton Marcus
from Baton Rouge. How you doing?

41:18.709 --> 41:19.962
Welcome to Second Calvary.

41:20.110 --> 41:21.577
- Thank you.
- Hi.

41:21.946 --> 41:24.701
I know he respects the church,

41:24.849 --> 41:28.004
but at this point, since I'm an outsider,
he's not respecting my opinion,

41:28.152 --> 41:30.239
'cause I'm pushing him to go see a doctor,
'cause she's not well,

41:30.387 --> 41:32.878
and I was hoping you could back me up.

41:33.624 --> 41:35.778
Well, let me tell you my history with Louis.

41:35.926 --> 41:39.082
When she was unexpectedly
pulled out of the Sunday school...

41:39.230 --> 41:42.719
- Right.
... we never found out exactly why,

41:42.867 --> 41:45.121
but he was definitely hostile.

41:45.269 --> 41:49.359
He felt that our Sunday school curriculum
wasn't, you know, sufficiently medieval,

41:49.507 --> 41:53.463
and this was not the same Louis
that I originally knew...

41:53.611 --> 41:55.965
- Did he threaten you at all?
- No, not per se,

41:56.113 --> 41:58.274
but there were voices raised.

41:59.350 --> 42:02.672
So, I think I'm the last guy

42:02.820 --> 42:05.288
- that Louis would really take counsel from.
- Wow. Yeah, maybe.

42:05.723 --> 42:09.412
And as I say, I mean, I wasn't afraid,
but it was very uncomfortable.

42:09.560 --> 42:11.425
How long ago was this?

42:12.263 --> 42:16.219
Two, I guess it's... Since I've seen Nell,
two and a half, two and a half years.

42:16.367 --> 42:18.855
It's been two years?
They haven't even come to church?

42:19.003 --> 42:21.563
No. And I heard about
the home-schooling thing.

42:21.939 --> 42:24.861
I'm not really one to sit here
and say whether that's right or wrong.

42:25.009 --> 42:29.946
I will say that Nell was, when she was here,
a vibrant, happy girl,

42:30.347 --> 42:35.972
and I just don't think to be cut off is,
you know, the best thing for the child.

42:36.120 --> 42:37.974
Would you be willing to come out
to the farm with me?

42:38.122 --> 42:40.352
Lf... Okay, I tell you what.

42:40.858 --> 42:44.259
You get Louis to agree for me
to come to the farm,

42:45.396 --> 42:48.284
and I'll be happy to do that.
I also can line up...

42:48.432 --> 42:49.652
I have a good friend,

42:49.800 --> 42:54.056
psychiatric head of the department
in Baton Rouge, that I can line up for Nell.

42:54.204 --> 42:56.726
Right. Okay, well, I'm gonna
get back to the farm. Thank you, Pastor.

42:56.874 --> 42:58.364
- Well, let me know. Great.
- I appreciate your time.

42:58.909 --> 43:02.709
- You get the pastor to make his contact...
- What's going on over there?

43:03.547 --> 43:05.412
That doesn't look good.

43:07.084 --> 43:11.384
I want my mother. I want my mother.

43:13.691 --> 43:18.219
- She's fine. Get that damn camera off.
- I want my mother. I want my mother.

43:20.764 --> 43:24.325
- Oh, my God. What happened?
- Caleb, you okay?

43:27.004 --> 43:28.494
Can you write?

43:31.642 --> 43:33.906
All right, all right. All right, here.

43:42.319 --> 43:44.219
Caleb? Caleb?

43:47.157 --> 43:49.378
Louis, we need to get him to the hospital.
Really bad pain.

43:49.526 --> 43:52.148
- Louis, what happened?
- He was trying to calm Nell down,

43:52.296 --> 43:54.696
and she attacked him with a knife.

43:55.933 --> 43:57.628
- She did this?
- Yes.

43:59.803 --> 44:01.824
- I got to get him to the hospital.
- Yeah, you better do that.

44:01.972 --> 44:03.793
Could you take him for me?
We need to get him there.

44:03.941 --> 44:07.900
Louis, what if the demon comes back?
I need to be here for that.

44:13.050 --> 44:14.449
You be well.

44:18.455 --> 44:20.889
Look what Caleb wrote.

44:27.197 --> 44:29.495
That's why I wanted to stay.

44:31.669 --> 44:32.897
Nell?

44:34.772 --> 44:37.036
Nell, honey. Can we come in?

44:39.443 --> 44:43.812
- He locked her in.
- Yeah. Hey, honey.

44:44.415 --> 44:45.835
Oh, my God. Hey.

44:45.983 --> 44:49.305
- Are you kidding?
- Let's go find something,

44:49.453 --> 44:51.546
something to get her out of that.

45:02.599 --> 45:05.755
I'm bad. I am. I'm bad.

45:05.903 --> 45:08.491
No, you're not. You're not bad.
Nell, you're not bad.

45:08.639 --> 45:12.328
He's gonna be mad when he comes home
and I'm not chained up.

45:12.476 --> 45:13.462
Okay.

45:13.610 --> 45:15.598
- I'm not gonna go to heaven.
- Honey, yes, you are.

45:15.746 --> 45:18.977
You'll go to heaven. All right?
You'll go to heaven. Oh, my.

45:20.250 --> 45:25.711
I remember hearing screaming,
and when I woke up, his face was cut.

45:26.190 --> 45:28.844
Does Caleb frighten you at all?
Does he ever hurt you

45:28.992 --> 45:32.450
- or tease you or anything like that?
- No, no. Never Caleb.

45:34.531 --> 45:37.022
Nell, has your father ever hurt you?

45:38.836 --> 45:39.928
No.

45:41.572 --> 45:43.904
- You can tell me.
- No.

45:48.178 --> 45:51.079
Let's put you back into bed.
What do you say?

46:28.252 --> 46:29.742
You hear that?

46:48.572 --> 46:51.598
- Is she sleepwalking?
- I don't know.

46:54.077 --> 46:55.169
Nell?

47:00.184 --> 47:02.049
Honey, can you hear us?

47:10.661 --> 47:11.821
Honey?

47:29.780 --> 47:30.966
- Nell?
- Nell? Honey?

47:31.114 --> 47:33.776
Oh, my God. Nell. Nell!

47:38.622 --> 47:39.642
Okay. It's okay. Right here.

47:39.790 --> 47:41.744
Just a doll. You're giving your doll a bath.
That's all.

47:41.892 --> 47:45.157
Hey. Here we go.

47:47.097 --> 47:49.964
Here we go. It's all right, honey.
It's gonna be okay.

47:50.801 --> 47:52.632
Let's take her to bed.

47:53.070 --> 47:56.164
Well, you look better.
I can see your eyes now.

48:00.677 --> 48:02.406
Did you make this?

48:05.916 --> 48:06.974
No.

48:10.520 --> 48:13.683
This is what I got
while we were in the bathroom.

48:20.831 --> 48:22.918
I don't know how she'd know Latin, though.

48:23.066 --> 48:25.660
- Maybe Louis taught her.
- He doesn't know.

48:28.372 --> 48:30.863
- So, it's Nell making those baby noises?
- Yeah.

48:31.141 --> 48:32.199
<i>Nell.</i>

48:47.090 --> 48:49.945
<i>- What's going on?
... and you can give her Pepto-Bismol</i>

48:50.093 --> 48:53.859
<i>for her nausea,
which is very common at this stage of a...</i>

48:54.531 --> 48:57.557
<i>Hi, this is Dr. Kile
from the Ivanwood General.</i>

48:58.135 --> 49:01.924
<i>We just want to make sure
that Nell does not take the Halcyon,</i>

49:02.072 --> 49:05.628
<i>as the person that prescribed it
did not know that she was pregnant.</i>

49:05.776 --> 49:09.965
<i>And you can give her Pepto-Bismol
for her nausea, which is...</i>

49:10.113 --> 49:12.501
Well, this explains it. There you have it.

49:12.649 --> 49:14.904
- Your underlying trauma.
- All they told us was that she was pregnant.

49:15.052 --> 49:16.438
You don't know who she's pregnant by.

49:16.586 --> 49:17.706
We're dealing with incest, okay?
Abusing his...

49:17.854 --> 49:20.009
Iris, you can't go saying that sort of thing
down here.

49:20.157 --> 49:21.343
It would ruin a person's life,
you understand?

49:21.491 --> 49:23.078
It's right there. It's obvious.
I mean, it's right there.

49:23.226 --> 49:24.613
We have to wait for him to come back
and talk to him.

49:24.761 --> 49:25.915
That's exactly what we have to do.
You can't...

49:26.063 --> 49:27.116
We need to take her, and we need to leave.

49:27.264 --> 49:29.185
We're not taking her anywhere.
That's kidnapping.

49:29.333 --> 49:30.786
Well, then what?
You're gonna keep exorcising her

49:30.934 --> 49:33.088
while her dad's raping her
upstairs in the bedroom?

49:33.236 --> 49:35.090
Okay, why don't we just take a break?
Can we just take a break?

49:35.238 --> 49:36.258
What? What kind of break are we taking?

49:36.406 --> 49:37.726
We have to wait for him, no matter what.

49:37.874 --> 49:39.428
- Fine.
- All right.

49:39.576 --> 49:42.665
Guys, why don't we just take a nap
for an hour? We're all pretty wiped out.

49:42.813 --> 49:44.178
Okay, great.

50:39.770 --> 50:41.499
Here, kitty, kitty.

51:50.774 --> 51:54.972
Nell! What are you doing?

51:55.345 --> 51:58.033
It's okay. Good girl. Let go. Let go.

51:58.181 --> 52:00.302
- Put the camera down.
- I'm so sorry.

52:00.450 --> 52:01.439
Let's get some clothes on you.

52:04.988 --> 52:06.546
Seems to be all right.

52:06.823 --> 52:08.313
Guys, come here. Take a look at this.

52:09.726 --> 52:11.580
- Oh, my God.
- Look at these pictures.

52:11.728 --> 52:14.754
- Same cat picture.
- Wow. Look at this one.

52:15.966 --> 52:18.730
Yeah, something's on fire.
Maybe the house.

52:19.069 --> 52:20.089
And look at this one on the right.

52:20.237 --> 52:23.468
- Is that me?
- Yeah. It's all of us. All of us dead.

52:24.541 --> 52:27.271
- I'm in the fire.
- I'm in a million pieces.

52:27.477 --> 52:32.141
- Daniel, you get your head chopped off.
- She's more messed up than I thought.

52:33.650 --> 52:34.603
Not comfortable with what?

52:34.751 --> 52:36.739
Well, I'm not comfortable
that we're in a house with someone

52:36.887 --> 52:40.042
who's doing pictures of my head
being chopped off. You know?

52:40.190 --> 52:42.745
Relax. It's just a bunch of drawings
from a little girl's imagination.

52:42.893 --> 52:43.946
Yeah, imagination's one thing,

52:44.094 --> 52:46.248
but she killed those animals,
and she cut her brother up pretty good.

52:46.396 --> 52:48.717
Well, do you think she's gonna hack you
to pieces and cut your head off?

52:48.865 --> 52:50.352
- Is that what you think?
- No, that's not what I'm saying,

52:50.500 --> 52:52.021
but we've seen signs
of her being dangerous before.

52:52.169 --> 52:53.756
They're just drawings, Daniel. You know,

52:53.904 --> 52:55.557
I mean, we happen to be in the house,

52:55.705 --> 52:56.658
and we happen to be in her drawings.

52:56.806 --> 52:59.561
She's a 16-year-old girl. All right?
We can overpower her if we need to.

52:59.709 --> 53:00.662
Yeah, well, a 16-year-old girl

53:00.810 --> 53:02.865
and a 16-year-old psychopath
are two different things.

53:03.013 --> 53:05.034
She's psychotic, but she's not capable
of chopping your head off.

53:05.182 --> 53:06.468
- Are you worried about that?
- I'm not worried.

53:06.616 --> 53:07.569
I'm just saying
that we should be concerned...

53:07.717 --> 53:08.971
Guys, just take it easy, all right?

53:09.119 --> 53:10.639
- We're all tired and...
- Right.

53:10.787 --> 53:14.043
...we're here to help her, okay?
So, let's keep things in perspective, okay?

53:14.191 --> 53:16.989
- All right, all right.
- All right, fine.

54:02.405 --> 54:05.670
- They saw you drag him around?
- Probably. No doubt.

54:14.918 --> 54:16.943
I'm gonna kill them both.

54:20.590 --> 54:23.718
- You hear that?
- Sounds like there's two people.

54:42.746 --> 54:45.943
- Who were you talking to?
- No one.

55:02.132 --> 55:04.794
I swear there were two people in there.

55:22.152 --> 55:25.908
<i>...just want to make sure
that Nell does not take the Halcyon,</i>

55:26.056 --> 55:29.578
<i>as the person that prescribed it
did not know that she was pregnant.</i>

55:29.726 --> 55:33.282
<i>And you can give her Pepto-Bismol
for her nausea,</i>

55:33.430 --> 55:35.751
<i>which is very common
at this stage of a pregnancy.</i>

55:35.899 --> 55:38.387
<i>But please do not give her the Halcyon.</i>

55:38.535 --> 55:39.555
<i>- The book was right.
- Thank you.</i>

55:39.703 --> 55:42.729
<i>If you have any questions,
please call us here.</i>

55:43.573 --> 55:46.662
- The book was right?
- Book was right.

55:46.810 --> 55:50.541
- What are you talking about?
- The demon defiled my daughter.

55:52.716 --> 55:55.070
My daughter is a virgin, 16-year-old virgin.

55:55.218 --> 55:58.774
How did she get pregnant?
The book said it. You showed it to me.

55:58.922 --> 56:01.243
I don't think
the book has any bearing on this.

56:01.391 --> 56:05.191
I think it's more earthly matters
that we're dealing with now.

56:07.364 --> 56:10.752
Reverend, I need you to perform
another exorcism.

56:10.900 --> 56:14.356
Get rid of that thing.
I will not let that thing grow inside of her.

56:14.504 --> 56:16.024
Louis, I'm not gonna perform
another exorcism.

56:16.172 --> 56:18.436
Reverend, I need you to help me.

56:19.275 --> 56:21.641
I need you to help Nell. Please.

56:22.145 --> 56:23.966
I don't believe a demon had anything
to do with this.

56:24.114 --> 56:26.468
Reverend, I need you to do another
exorcism for the soul of my daughter.

56:26.616 --> 56:28.403
- Louis, this is not about an exorcism.
- I need you to do this.

56:28.551 --> 56:31.206
Louis, I'm not gonna do an exorcism.
What she needs is a doctor.

56:31.354 --> 56:34.255
I know this must be really hard to hear,

56:35.291 --> 56:38.590
but Nell's welfare
is what we're all concerned with.

56:40.897 --> 56:42.330
Right, Louis?

56:45.668 --> 56:50.731
Reverend, if you can't save
my daughter's soul, I will.

56:54.244 --> 56:56.303
What are you talking about?

56:57.447 --> 56:59.301
I would like you all to leave my property.

56:59.449 --> 57:04.273
If you're not off my property in five minutes,
I will consider you all trespassers.

57:04.421 --> 57:07.720
Now, Louis.
Louis, you need to be reasonable. Louis.

57:17.934 --> 57:19.834
I bet he doesn't want to take her to a doctor.

57:20.670 --> 57:22.457
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

57:22.605 --> 57:24.693
I don't want to wait around to find out
what he's gonna do to Nell.

57:24.841 --> 57:27.062
- I'm afraid he's gonna try to hurt her.
- He's gonna kill her.

57:27.210 --> 57:29.531
Death is the only salvation.
You told him that.

57:29.679 --> 57:32.100
Yeah, I know. I think you're right.

57:32.248 --> 57:34.336
We should just take her.
Just grab her and go.

57:34.484 --> 57:37.976
- How are we gonna do that?
- We'll just take her and go.

57:38.922 --> 57:41.823
- What's he doing?
- He's still praying.

57:43.893 --> 57:47.192
- He's got a lot of guns in the house, Cotton.
- I know.

57:48.064 --> 57:49.031
Come on.

57:53.837 --> 57:57.773
- Cotton, what is that?
- I don't know. Somebody upstairs.

58:01.978 --> 58:03.969
- Nell?
- Nell?

58:13.823 --> 58:16.986
I have a key. I have a key here.
Hang on, Nell!

58:24.601 --> 58:25.727
Nell!

59:15.852 --> 59:17.376
Come on, honey.

59:19.856 --> 59:21.483
It's us. Come on.

59:27.564 --> 59:31.295
There you go.
That's a good girl. That's a good girl.

59:32.802 --> 59:35.464
That's a good girl. Right here, yeah.

59:36.005 --> 59:38.405
It's Cotton. It's Cotton. Come on.

59:38.741 --> 59:41.141
Come on, honey. That's it.
That's it. Good girl.

59:41.578 --> 59:45.036
Good girl. It's gonna be okay.
Here you go. That's good.

59:46.883 --> 59:50.546
Nell, we're gonna go now.
We're gonna get you in the car.

59:53.122 --> 59:54.589
Are you okay?

59:55.692 --> 59:56.716
Nell!

59:59.429 --> 1:00:00.521
Nell!

1:00:06.002 --> 1:00:07.333
Nell, stop!

1:00:10.907 --> 1:00:12.033
Nell?

1:00:14.978 --> 1:00:17.105
- You okay?
- It's not that bad.

1:00:22.218 --> 1:00:23.276
Nell?

1:00:32.462 --> 1:00:33.588
Nell?

1:01:01.190 --> 1:01:02.248
Here.

1:01:10.166 --> 1:01:12.566
- What is she doing?
- I don't know.

1:01:54.877 --> 1:01:56.310
Lights are on. Louis is here.

1:01:57.313 --> 1:01:58.366
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.

1:01:58.514 --> 1:01:59.467
- We'll get back to the hotel.
- Fine.

1:01:59.615 --> 1:02:01.412
- We'll call the cops from there.
- Fine. Do you have the keys?

1:02:01.584 --> 1:02:03.814
- Yeah.
- Here. Cotton.

1:02:06.522 --> 1:02:09.457
- Nell.
- No, let's go. Can we please just go?

1:02:10.893 --> 1:02:13.123
- Cotton.
- Here, come here. Come on.

1:02:17.700 --> 1:02:19.964
- Nell?
- Cotton.

1:02:22.872 --> 1:02:26.831
- Nell, are you all right? Honey?
- Cotton.

1:02:29.278 --> 1:02:31.838
Nell, look at me. Can you look at me?

1:02:36.886 --> 1:02:37.853
No!

1:02:42.792 --> 1:02:46.353
- Iris.
- Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1:02:46.829 --> 1:02:49.821
- You got her?
- Oh, God.

1:02:50.733 --> 1:02:51.820
- Louis!
- Look.

1:02:51.968 --> 1:02:53.299
It's Louis!

1:02:53.603 --> 1:02:56.333
Louis, put the gun down, please. Please.

1:03:03.112 --> 1:03:04.841
Get the door! Lock the door!

1:03:07.283 --> 1:03:09.604
Get away from the door! Come here!

1:03:09.752 --> 1:03:11.310
- He's coming!
- Come here.

1:03:30.039 --> 1:03:32.494
- Let her go! Get away!
- No! Louis, no!

1:03:32.642 --> 1:03:34.496
- You don't want to kill her.
- Move away from her!

1:03:34.644 --> 1:03:36.669
- No, no.
- Shoot me, Daddy!

1:03:37.747 --> 1:03:39.408
- Nell. No, Nell.
- Just shoot me!

1:03:40.183 --> 1:03:44.244
I was wrong. You were right.
She's possessed. I'll do another exorcism.

1:03:44.654 --> 1:03:46.053
I'll do it.

1:04:05.274 --> 1:04:07.902
<i>I set out to make this documentary
to save children,</i>

1:04:08.144 --> 1:04:10.408
<i>and now I'm gonna get her killed.</i>

1:04:10.746 --> 1:04:12.805
<i>- What would you have said?
- I don't know.</i>

1:04:14.317 --> 1:04:19.118
It's a no-win situation. What, is she gonna
admit that she's pregnant? And then what?

1:04:19.322 --> 1:04:21.843
Soon, we're all gonna have
a shotgun in our face.

1:04:21.991 --> 1:04:25.085
What could a second exorcism
possibly accomplish?

1:04:59.128 --> 1:05:00.595
Hey, Nell.

1:05:15.444 --> 1:05:19.540
I didn't get him out.
I didn't get the demon out. It's my fault.

1:05:21.217 --> 1:05:25.745
But if you can be strong,
I need you to do it one more time.

1:05:27.924 --> 1:05:30.324
- Can you do that for me?
- No, I don't think I...

1:05:31.093 --> 1:05:33.653
I just need to see him one more time.

1:05:34.664 --> 1:05:40.288
It's not that I don't think I can,
it's just that I don't know how to do it.

1:05:40.436 --> 1:05:43.458
- It just comes involuntarily.
- I think you can.

1:05:43.606 --> 1:05:46.700
I don't have any control over
what happens to me.

1:05:48.945 --> 1:05:50.640
I think you could.

1:05:52.081 --> 1:05:53.981
I think if you want to.

1:05:55.017 --> 1:05:57.071
I wanted to get better last time, though.

1:05:57.219 --> 1:05:58.306
- I know. I know.
- Sorry.

1:05:58.454 --> 1:06:00.008
- That was...
- I really wanted it.

1:06:00.156 --> 1:06:03.011
I mean, I don't think I could have wanted it
any more than last time.

1:06:03.159 --> 1:06:06.424
I know. I failed you that time.

1:06:07.763 --> 1:06:11.324
But this time, I won't.
This time, I won't. I promise.

1:06:12.168 --> 1:06:16.400
But I need you to be willing
to bring him up again.

1:06:17.807 --> 1:06:20.139
I think you can do it. I think...

1:06:21.377 --> 1:06:25.313
I think if you just allow yourself,
I think you can do it.

1:06:31.988 --> 1:06:33.717
- Nell, can you hear me?
- Yeah.

1:06:33.923 --> 1:06:35.823
All right, I'm right here.

1:06:37.960 --> 1:06:41.783
- I'm feeling like I'm falling a lot.
- Okay. Well, you're right here.

1:06:41.931 --> 1:06:43.865
I've got you right here.

1:06:44.433 --> 1:06:47.197
- But it's getting hard to see you.
- Okay.

1:06:49.739 --> 1:06:53.127
Here we go. I'm right here. I'm not going
anywhere. I'm not going anywhere, honey.

1:06:53.275 --> 1:06:55.266
- Right here.
- What is that?

1:06:57.680 --> 1:06:58.900
- There's nothing there.
- What is it?

1:06:59.048 --> 1:07:02.074
There's nothing there.
I'm right here, honey. I'm right here.

1:07:02.518 --> 1:07:04.873
- Right...
- What? Don't. Please, help. It's right...

1:07:05.021 --> 1:07:06.107
- It's coming.
- Good, let him come.

1:07:06.255 --> 1:07:07.208
Let him come, Nell.

1:07:07.356 --> 1:07:08.516
He's coming through my skin.

1:07:09.592 --> 1:07:12.480
Get him out of my skin. Please.

1:07:12.628 --> 1:07:16.291
It's okay. I'm right here.
I'm right here, Nell. It's okay.

1:07:20.636 --> 1:07:23.230
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

1:07:26.709 --> 1:07:27.903
Nell?

1:07:31.680 --> 1:07:32.806
Nell.

1:07:35.251 --> 1:07:36.650
He has her!

1:07:42.458 --> 1:07:46.417
Nell, can you hear me? Nell?

1:07:48.831 --> 1:07:55.066
Reverend Marcus.
I hear you don't believe in me.

1:07:57.840 --> 1:07:59.205
Who are you?

1:08:06.816 --> 1:08:08.010
Abalam.

1:08:10.986 --> 1:08:14.888
- Where's Nell?
- In the fire.

1:08:16.625 --> 1:08:18.889
She's been there for some time.

1:08:21.497 --> 1:08:23.226
Soon you'll join her.

1:08:25.134 --> 1:08:27.796
Don't believe the demon's lies, Louis.

1:08:29.038 --> 1:08:30.733
The demon's lies?

1:08:41.450 --> 1:08:44.005
If I invoke the name of Jesus Christ,
our savior,

1:08:44.153 --> 1:08:47.020
you should be compelled to leave this girl.

1:08:48.390 --> 1:08:51.512
If I beseech our Lord and invoke him,
and I say,

1:08:51.660 --> 1:08:53.147
"Put on the whole armor of God,

1:08:53.295 --> 1:08:55.316
"that he may be able to stand
the wiles of the devil.

1:08:55.464 --> 1:08:57.018
"For while we wrestle not
against flesh and blood,

1:08:57.166 --> 1:08:58.486
"but against principalities, against powers,

1:08:58.634 --> 1:08:59.854
"against the rulers of darkness
in this world,

1:09:00.002 --> 1:09:01.055
- "against the spirits! We have... "
- Words.

1:09:01.203 --> 1:09:03.398
Words, words, words!

1:09:06.775 --> 1:09:08.106
I'll tell you what.

1:09:08.310 --> 1:09:13.077
If you can keep quiet for 10 seconds,
I'll let the girl go.

1:09:13.516 --> 1:09:18.010
- Yes.
- Agreed.

1:09:21.590 --> 1:09:22.614
One.

1:09:26.829 --> 1:09:27.887
Two.

1:09:31.033 --> 1:09:32.120
Nell.

1:09:32.268 --> 1:09:34.031
- Three.
- Stop it. Stop it!

1:09:35.404 --> 1:09:38.396
- Honey. Honey, stop.
- You lose.

1:09:50.619 --> 1:09:53.087
- Louis, I'm sorry.
- Do something.

1:09:55.391 --> 1:09:57.325
I'll do something, Daddy.

1:09:57.693 --> 1:10:00.821
- Reverend, how about a blowing job?
- Nell.

1:10:06.802 --> 1:10:08.429
What did you say?

1:10:11.941 --> 1:10:13.738
What's a blowing job?

1:10:15.144 --> 1:10:18.045
Tell me what that is.
You don't know, do you?

1:10:19.148 --> 1:10:23.137
You don't even know that's not what
it's called, because you are not a demon.

1:10:23.285 --> 1:10:24.872
A demon would know what that is.

1:10:25.020 --> 1:10:28.080
But maybe not a 16-year-old
home-schooled girl.

1:10:28.290 --> 1:10:30.311
- Because I don't think you're a demon, Nell.
- No.

1:10:30.459 --> 1:10:32.346
I don't think you're a demon.
I think you're an innocent girl.

1:10:32.494 --> 1:10:33.714
- No.
- I think you're an innocent girl.

1:10:33.862 --> 1:10:36.484
I think you're a little innocent girl who
doesn't know what she's talking about!

1:10:36.632 --> 1:10:38.019
- I think you're an innocent little girl!
- No! No!

1:10:38.167 --> 1:10:41.055
That's what I think!
I think you're a little girl!

1:10:41.203 --> 1:10:43.433
She isn't innocent!

1:10:45.507 --> 1:10:47.338
She isn't innocent.

1:10:48.110 --> 1:10:50.476
- It's okay. It's okay. Let it out.
- She...

1:10:51.013 --> 1:10:53.208
It's all right. It's just... Turn the camera off.

1:10:54.850 --> 1:10:55.970
- She isn't...
- It's gonna be okay.

1:10:56.118 --> 1:10:57.338
- She isn't innocent.
- Let it out, honey. It's okay.

1:10:57.486 --> 1:10:59.073
- She isn't innocent.
- Turn it off.

1:10:59.221 --> 1:11:00.279
Turn it off!

1:11:07.830 --> 1:11:09.161
She looks like she's resting.

1:11:09.498 --> 1:11:12.296
She is relieved,
and she is resting really well.

1:11:12.868 --> 1:11:14.388
- Praise God.
- Praise God, indeed.

1:11:14.536 --> 1:11:17.258
- Louis, do you know a boy named Logan?
- No.

1:11:17.406 --> 1:11:18.926
He works at a cafe or a restaurant
somewhere around here.

1:11:19.074 --> 1:11:20.598
Is Abalam gone?

1:11:21.210 --> 1:11:25.203
Louis, your daughter doesn't have a demon.
Your daughter's suffering from shame.

1:11:25.748 --> 1:11:28.478
Nell is pregnant, and the father is Logan.

1:11:28.851 --> 1:11:31.439
No, sir. That's impossible. I'm afraid not.

1:11:31.587 --> 1:11:33.608
Louis, you have to admit
that if Nell says that's what happened...

1:11:33.756 --> 1:11:35.917
She's delirious.
Look what she went through.

1:11:37.293 --> 1:11:39.454
- Look what she went through.
- Listen to her yourself, okay?

1:11:39.862 --> 1:11:41.716
We'll talk to Nell ourselves,
and we'll hear it from her,

1:11:41.864 --> 1:11:43.331
and you'll see the truth that she has.

1:11:43.532 --> 1:11:44.485
Can we do that?

1:11:44.633 --> 1:11:47.101
A couple years ago
when her mom was dying,

1:11:48.037 --> 1:11:51.768
and he came by and asked her if she wanted
to go for a ride in his car,

1:11:52.441 --> 1:11:54.875
and he was driving a sports car.

1:11:55.611 --> 1:11:58.341
It was old, but still a sports car.

1:12:00.716 --> 1:12:04.277
And she got in it,
and they started driving out to a field.

1:12:05.554 --> 1:12:09.718
Then he turned to her and he asked her
if she wanted to have sex.

1:12:11.060 --> 1:12:12.687
And she said yes.

1:12:14.363 --> 1:12:17.059
She asked him, she said, "Am I pretty?"

1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:22.027
And he said, "Yes. "
He said, "I think you're so pretty. "

1:12:22.771 --> 1:12:24.659
- And he took her and he laid her back.
- Stop it!

1:12:24.807 --> 1:12:28.095
- She loved how he touched her.
- You were raped! You were raped!

1:12:28.243 --> 1:12:32.009
- She said yes. She liked it.
- That's enough, honey.

1:12:43.058 --> 1:12:46.027
Well, she's right about one thing,
Reverend.

1:12:47.129 --> 1:12:49.757
There is a boy that works at that cafe,

1:12:51.433 --> 1:12:56.029
and I have no idea what his name is,
but for all I know, he could be Logan.

1:13:00.342 --> 1:13:02.902
Pastor Manley,
Reverend Cotton Marcus calling.

1:13:03.345 --> 1:13:07.042
Could you please call me back?
I'm at the Sweetzer farm.

1:13:17.493 --> 1:13:19.188
Pastor Manley, thank you so much
for coming out.

1:13:19.628 --> 1:13:20.948
Reverend Marcus, a pleasure.

1:13:21.096 --> 1:13:23.064
- Good to see you. Welcome.
- Good to see you.

1:13:24.500 --> 1:13:27.196
- Well, just don't forget to smile.
- Hello.

1:13:27.469 --> 1:13:29.630
Louis is upstairs with Nell.

1:13:32.007 --> 1:13:34.929
She finally admitted that Logan was the boy
who impregnated her.

1:13:35.077 --> 1:13:37.798
- Logan.
- Yeah, he works at the cafe down the road.

1:13:37.946 --> 1:13:39.174
I know him.

1:13:39.448 --> 1:13:40.601
So, frankly, Pastor,

1:13:40.749 --> 1:13:44.005
I don't know what more I can do
for them at this point.

1:13:44.153 --> 1:13:47.775
Is Louis on board with psychological help
with my friend in Baton Rouge?

1:13:47.923 --> 1:13:51.012
Yes, do you... I think Louis would be
amenable to that at this point.

1:13:51.160 --> 1:13:53.648
I'll be... I'll call him first thing.

1:13:53.796 --> 1:13:55.383
- Louis.
- Pastor Manley, thanks.

1:13:55.531 --> 1:13:57.863
- It's been too long. Good to see you.
- Thank you for coming, sir.

1:13:58.300 --> 1:13:59.494
My pleasure.

1:14:00.469 --> 1:14:03.438
- Hello. I'm Louis.
- Becky.

1:14:04.139 --> 1:14:05.436
- Hey, Nell.
- Hi.

1:14:06.408 --> 1:14:09.130
- It's good to see you.
- It's good to see you.

1:14:09.278 --> 1:14:11.610
"I cried out to you, O Lord.
You are my refuge,

1:14:11.780 --> 1:14:14.835
"my portion in the land of the living.
Please attend to my cry.

1:14:14.983 --> 1:14:18.806
"Please attend to this child,
for thou art stronger

1:14:18.954 --> 1:14:23.210
"than any possible thing that could
attack this lovely servant of yours.

1:14:23.358 --> 1:14:25.680
"Bring this child's soul out of prison

1:14:25.828 --> 1:14:27.955
"that I may praise your name. "

1:14:49.852 --> 1:14:54.551
I'd be lying if I said I was sure of everything
I did when it came to that.

1:14:54.990 --> 1:14:58.756
I've never seen anything like that. Poor Nell.

1:14:59.695 --> 1:15:02.596
She's gonna have to get some serious help.

1:15:03.565 --> 1:15:05.795
Louis could use some, as well.

1:15:06.668 --> 1:15:10.458
Hey, what was the name of that cafe
that that boy worked at, Logan?

1:15:10.606 --> 1:15:12.471
- Riche's, right?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1:15:13.675 --> 1:15:15.233
Hi, how you doing?

1:15:16.445 --> 1:15:20.438
She's lying, all right?
I'm not the father of her child at all.

1:15:21.383 --> 1:15:23.604
I don't even know the girl.
We met once, you know.

1:15:23.752 --> 1:15:26.073
It was Pastor Manley's party,
and we were both there,

1:15:26.221 --> 1:15:28.676
and she saw me,
and she started talking to me

1:15:28.824 --> 1:15:31.245
for, you know, maybe, like, a minute. Okay?

1:15:31.393 --> 1:15:32.613
- This is Pastor Manley's house?
- Yes.

1:15:32.761 --> 1:15:34.548
- Last summer?
- Yes, last summer. But...

1:15:34.696 --> 1:15:36.823
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

1:15:38.267 --> 1:15:42.294
I didn't get her pregnant, though.
And another thing, I don't...

1:15:42.471 --> 1:15:47.966
She's nice and everything, but I'm not
exactly, interested in, you know...

1:15:50.012 --> 1:15:53.539
- Girls.
- Right. So, she's lying.

1:15:55.017 --> 1:15:57.171
What's a pastor doing throwing a party
for a bunch of 16-year-olds?

1:15:57.319 --> 1:15:59.273
He said he hadn't seen her
in three years, right?

1:15:59.421 --> 1:16:02.109
Yeah, he's lying. And Nell was lying,
'cause the kid was obviously gay.

1:16:02.257 --> 1:16:04.555
- Yeah.
- Why would she lie to us?

1:16:04.993 --> 1:16:07.648
To get rid of us? Maybe she wanted
to get us out of the house.

1:16:07.796 --> 1:16:09.263
Yeah, but why?

1:16:11.767 --> 1:16:14.201
- What are you doing?
- Turning around.

1:16:15.571 --> 1:16:17.869
- Going back to the house?
- Yeah.

1:16:45.601 --> 1:16:46.727
Louis!

1:17:00.349 --> 1:17:01.509
Louis!

1:17:11.760 --> 1:17:13.091
Oh, my God.

1:17:31.179 --> 1:17:34.444
Cotton, the phones have been ripped out
of the wall.

1:17:36.418 --> 1:17:38.909
- Do you hear that?
- What?

1:17:45.560 --> 1:17:49.291
Cotton? Cotton? Cotton, listen to me.

1:17:51.667 --> 1:17:53.191
Cotton, please.

1:17:57.072 --> 1:17:59.627
- This is insane.
- We need to find Nell.

1:17:59.775 --> 1:18:01.868
She's got a point, Cotton.

1:18:09.284 --> 1:18:11.013
Turn off that light.

1:18:45.921 --> 1:18:48.515
That's Nell right there on the table.

1:18:54.229 --> 1:18:55.316
Is that Louis?

1:18:55.464 --> 1:18:56.917
- It is Louis.
- Is he tied up?

1:18:57.065 --> 1:18:59.829
- Oh, my God.
- We should get the police, guys.

1:19:01.603 --> 1:19:03.662
- I want to get out of here.
- Wait, wait.

1:19:06.441 --> 1:19:08.204
That's Pastor Manley.

1:19:09.444 --> 1:19:11.309
That's Pastor Manley.

1:19:13.148 --> 1:19:15.139
Is he leading the thing?

1:19:19.521 --> 1:19:22.046
- We got to get help right now.
- What are they doing?

1:19:22.858 --> 1:19:24.792
- What are they doing with her?
- What is it?

1:19:27.429 --> 1:19:31.991
- Oh, God.
- That isn't human.

1:19:37.105 --> 1:19:38.697
Hail Abalam!

1:19:49.484 --> 1:19:52.544
Daniel, I want to get out of here. Right now.

1:20:04.499 --> 1:20:06.558
We got to go. We got to go.

1:20:23.151 --> 1:20:26.314
Cotton, what are you doing?
Cotton. Cotton!

1:20:26.688 --> 1:20:30.215
Demon, you cannot have the soul
of this girl, for she is a creature of God!

1:20:31.493 --> 1:20:36.692
- The one with the camera! Get him!
- Daniel, they're coming! Run! Run!

1:20:37.232 --> 1:20:38.722
Go! Go! Go!

1:20:48.543 --> 1:20:52.377
- Wait! Please! No! No!
- Kill her! Kill the bitch!

1:21:39.227 --> 1:21:40.489
Caleb.
