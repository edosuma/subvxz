00:24.232 --> 00:26.026
Are you satisfied now?

00:27.527 --> 00:29.696
We've been around this corridor
three times...

00:29.780 --> 00:31.573
and we ain't seen nothing.

00:42.792 --> 00:44.377
You do what you want to do.

00:44.461 --> 00:48.298
I'm going to the back, listen to the radio,
and have me some supper.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.537
What in tarnation has gotten into you?

01:31.257 --> 01:33.301
Come on, let's get out of here!

03:15.444 --> 03:18.196
You've heard about the building
that collapsed last night.

03:19.197 --> 03:21.825
This is what's left of two other buildings.

03:22.326 --> 03:25.829
The city's trying to figure out
what caused them to collapse.

03:26.204 --> 03:30.375
All the night watchman could tell us
was that he heard noises just before.

03:31.460 --> 03:32.919
Noises? Like what?

03:34.546 --> 03:36.465
He said they sounded like...

03:36.882 --> 03:39.718
a million little saws or teeth...
I don't know.

03:40.635 --> 03:42.179
He wasn't much help.

03:42.679 --> 03:45.056
Have you found any
common denominators?

03:45.265 --> 03:46.516
Possibly one.

03:46.600 --> 03:50.395
Ownership of all the buildings
was traced back to a parent company.

03:51.271 --> 03:52.897
GDH Enterprises.

03:53.982 --> 03:55.942
Gideon D. Harcourt.

03:56.234 --> 03:58.570
They invented the phrase
"industrial giant"...

03:58.653 --> 04:00.613
just to describe him, I hear.

04:01.489 --> 04:03.199
You think it's sabotage?

04:03.408 --> 04:06.077
We really don't have any evidence
to that effect.

04:06.161 --> 04:09.330
But considering the fact that
quite a few buildings in this town...

04:09.414 --> 04:11.791
are traced back to his corporation...

04:13.042 --> 04:14.627
We'd better find out.

04:22.802 --> 04:23.845
Yes?

04:23.928 --> 04:27.932
Have you had the opportunity to read
the newspaper today, Mr. Harcourt?

04:28.474 --> 04:31.269
Another one of your buildings
is on the front page.

04:31.352 --> 04:33.438
Exactly as you predicted.

04:33.604 --> 04:37.191
I don't know how or why you're doing this,
but I do know you have a price.

04:37.275 --> 04:38.359
What is it?

04:38.443 --> 04:42.780
Hard as it may be for your materialistic
little mind to grasp, Mr. Harcourt...

04:43.573 --> 04:45.116
I don't want money.

04:45.742 --> 04:49.203
I want you to shut down
the Easton chemical plant.

04:51.456 --> 04:53.124
Ecological blackmail?

04:54.083 --> 04:55.334
That's absurd.

04:55.459 --> 04:59.714
You will shut down
your operations at the plant immediately.

05:00.298 --> 05:04.468
Cancel any and all shipments you planned
to make of the EF-11 pesticide.

05:05.136 --> 05:07.513
And destroy the EF-11 formula.

05:08.556 --> 05:10.641
Or I will destroy you.

05:10.808 --> 05:12.226
You listen to me.

05:12.685 --> 05:15.938
I didn't build an empire
heeding threats from people like you...

05:16.022 --> 05:17.106
whoever you are.

05:17.189 --> 05:18.441
Well, then...

05:19.024 --> 05:22.528
prepare to see that empire crumble,
Mr. Harcourt.

05:23.779 --> 05:26.115
My name, by the way...

05:27.116 --> 05:28.242
is Formicida.

05:53.017 --> 05:54.059
Diana Prince.

05:54.143 --> 05:56.145
Diana, this is Dr. Douglas Radcliffe.

05:56.228 --> 05:59.064
We met at the Western Securities
and Science Conference.

05:59.148 --> 06:00.274
Radcliffe.

06:01.024 --> 06:03.318
Oh, right. The chemist.

06:03.610 --> 06:04.736
I'm being followed.

06:04.820 --> 06:07.698
I know who's responsible
for those buildings caving in.

06:07.781 --> 06:09.700
You do? How?

06:09.825 --> 06:12.369
I can't talk now.
Meet me outside the old warehouse...

06:12.452 --> 06:15.706
on Jefferson and 55th, at 6:30.
No one will be around then.

06:15.789 --> 06:19.167
I'll tell you everything, but please,
Diana, just be there.

06:27.009 --> 06:28.468
Afraid we lost him.

06:28.552 --> 06:30.262
You may have lost him...

06:30.429 --> 06:33.348
but I just heard from
another one of my employees.

06:34.057 --> 06:36.268
Doug intends to meet someone later.

06:36.518 --> 06:38.270
He doesn't know it yet...

06:38.478 --> 06:40.522
but he's going to meet us, too.

06:45.944 --> 06:46.987
Diana?

06:58.707 --> 06:59.958
In here, Doug.

07:56.764 --> 07:58.474
You check back in there.

08:36.846 --> 08:38.681
Okay, boys. The fun's over.

08:39.139 --> 08:41.892
Oh, no, Wonder Woman. It's just begun.

08:48.732 --> 08:51.235
Dr. Radcliffe and I have an appointment.

10:18.405 --> 10:19.614
Hello, Doug.

10:20.407 --> 10:21.783
How's your head?

10:24.786 --> 10:29.207
The least you could do was tell that
goon squad of yours to take it easy on me.

10:29.707 --> 10:31.334
Especially that witch.

10:32.252 --> 10:34.420
What rock did you find her under?

10:38.341 --> 10:40.510
Would you like something to drink?

10:43.471 --> 10:44.764
Stop simpering.

10:45.890 --> 10:49.644
I knew you were the one
sabotaging Harcourt's buildings.

10:50.436 --> 10:52.939
And that's why I'm here. Isn't it?

10:54.399 --> 10:56.734
I couldn't let you tell anyone, Doug.

11:01.614 --> 11:04.534
You know what, Irene, you should
cut the charming hostess routine.

11:04.617 --> 11:06.786
It hardly becomes a jail keeper.

11:09.956 --> 11:13.417
You should never have sold my pesticide
to GDH Enterprise.

11:14.961 --> 11:16.837
Our pesticide, Irene.

11:17.964 --> 11:19.966
I worked on it, too, you know.

11:21.467 --> 11:22.551
It was wrong.

11:22.635 --> 11:24.804
I needed the money. I offered you half.

11:24.887 --> 11:27.890
You wouldn't take that
or any of the credit either.

11:29.350 --> 11:31.477
It isn't the money that made it wrong.

11:31.560 --> 11:35.397
Most people do what they have to do,
and then get on with it.

11:35.981 --> 11:38.901
You never learned how to do that,
have you, Irene?

11:39.819 --> 11:41.570
Lives are at stake, Doug.

11:47.868 --> 11:51.247
Irene, I'm really sorry
for making you go through all that.

11:51.956 --> 11:54.458
I don't hold anything against you, Doug.

11:54.667 --> 11:55.793
You don't?

11:56.168 --> 11:57.252
No.

11:58.504 --> 11:59.672
Not really.

12:05.010 --> 12:06.553
I believe that.

12:08.931 --> 12:11.141
You've always been a decent person.

12:12.893 --> 12:16.271
I'm really sorry for putting down
what you're trying to do.

12:16.897 --> 12:19.775
If you'd let me,
I really would like to help you.

12:23.111 --> 12:24.613
I don't believe it.

12:25.531 --> 12:26.907
It's true.

12:27.366 --> 12:28.617
It really is.

12:29.701 --> 12:31.411
We worked together once.

12:31.995 --> 12:33.830
We can work together again.

12:34.039 --> 12:36.583
Let's clear this whole thing up together.

12:37.292 --> 12:38.335
Okay?

12:39.294 --> 12:40.712
- Cut it out!
- Come on.

12:40.796 --> 12:42.422
Just stop it! Cawley!

12:42.672 --> 12:43.715
Oh, come on.

12:43.799 --> 12:45.884
- Take him downstairs!
- This is-

12:45.967 --> 12:48.136
I have learned a few things, Doug.

12:48.512 --> 12:50.222
I may still be a simpering weakling...

12:50.305 --> 12:53.767
but I've learned that there are ways
to take care of users like you!

12:53.850 --> 12:56.186
You're in a lot more trouble
than you think, Irene.

12:56.269 --> 12:59.439
I already made contact
with an IADC agent.

12:59.523 --> 13:03.401
It's just a matter of time before
they blow your little crusade wide open.

13:03.485 --> 13:05.278
I know who you're meeting.

13:05.403 --> 13:07.280
Her name is Diana Prince.

13:08.156 --> 13:09.199
Cawley.

13:09.282 --> 13:10.659
This is kidnapping, Irene.

13:10.742 --> 13:12.243
Don't make it worse on yourself.

13:12.327 --> 13:13.411
Irene?

13:16.956 --> 13:21.544
Radcliffe, Douglas Emory, holder
of a doctorate in biochemistry from Ohio.

13:22.629 --> 13:26.841
That's him. I'm looking for any connection
between him and GDH Enterprises.

13:28.384 --> 13:30.220
Did you say something else?

13:31.429 --> 13:33.431
No. I was just yawning, Ira.

13:34.933 --> 13:37.477
It's because it's late,
not because I'm bored.

13:37.560 --> 13:40.021
Perhaps you Would like to hear a joke?

13:40.480 --> 13:43.775
No, thanks anyway.
Just the information on Radcliffe.

13:44.400 --> 13:47.195
Six months ago GDH Enterprises...

13:47.278 --> 13:51.074
purchased a formula
from Dr. Douglas Radcliffe.

13:51.699 --> 13:52.909
A pesticide?

13:54.077 --> 13:58.039
Ten-to-one it's the pesticide that
Harcourt's starting to market tomorrow.

13:58.122 --> 14:00.500
It's called EF-11. Have you seen this?

14:01.417 --> 14:05.379
And 10-to-1,
whoever is making disaster areas...

14:05.463 --> 14:07.340
out of Harcourt's buildings...

14:07.423 --> 14:10.009
is also responsible for Doug's kidnapping.

14:10.426 --> 14:11.886
Doug's kidnapping?

14:12.094 --> 14:14.096
I went to meet him and...

14:15.264 --> 14:18.142
he was abducted in front of my very eyes.

14:21.604 --> 14:23.814
This is the only clue I could find.

14:27.818 --> 14:28.861
Ants?

14:30.529 --> 14:34.909
They literally chewed their way
through solid flooring.

14:35.409 --> 14:37.787
And in an isolated area.

14:37.953 --> 14:40.664
Like they were being controlled,
or something.

14:41.874 --> 14:43.459
Ira, a quick readout.

14:45.336 --> 14:47.463
That would sound a lot more incredible...

14:47.546 --> 14:50.341
if we hadn't just been
talking about pesticides.

14:50.424 --> 14:51.967
My thoughts exactly.

14:56.055 --> 15:00.017
Identification ofbiological life form.
Input completed.

15:00.643 --> 15:02.478
Phylum: Arthropoda.

15:02.728 --> 15:04.104
Class: Insecta.

15:04.229 --> 15:06.023
Order: Hymenoptera.

15:06.649 --> 15:08.484
Family: Formicidae.

15:08.692 --> 15:10.486
In plain English, please.

15:11.403 --> 15:13.155
Specimens are carpenter ants...

15:13.238 --> 15:16.283
Well known for their ability
to tunnel through Wood.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.035
Ants.

15:19.995 --> 15:21.413
One more thing, Ira.

15:21.497 --> 15:24.666
Would you please cross-index Radcliffe...

15:24.750 --> 15:28.212
and/or GDH Enterprises
with anyone in the scientific community...

15:28.295 --> 15:29.880
specializing in ants.

15:30.005 --> 15:31.798
And give her a readout tomorrow.

15:31.882 --> 15:34.551
Do you realize how late it is? Look at this.

15:35.844 --> 15:36.929
Now I do.

15:37.721 --> 15:39.431
No wonder I was yawning.

15:40.015 --> 15:42.517
Tomorrow, Ira, and sweet dreams.

15:43.143 --> 15:44.978
I wonder what Ira would dream about?

15:45.062 --> 15:46.688
I shudder to think.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.691
Good night, Rover.

15:52.444 --> 15:55.947
A roving computer module
such as yourself...

15:56.031 --> 15:59.201
could be of special value
in this investigation.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.328
Are you ready for programming?

16:03.788 --> 16:08.793
Prepare circuits B-4 through CM-2
for programming.

16:43.912 --> 16:46.122
Success achieved again.

16:59.844 --> 17:00.928
Hello?

17:01.012 --> 17:04.973
You failed to shut down the Easton
chemical plant today, Mr. Harcourt.

17:05.058 --> 17:07.310
Phone calls in the middle of the night?

17:07.393 --> 17:09.729
You're cheapening your act, Formicida.

17:09.811 --> 17:14.025
So it looks like tomorrow I'm going
to have to hit a little closer to home.

17:15.233 --> 17:16.777
Sorry, but I'm not frightened.

17:16.861 --> 17:17.944
Yet.

17:18.029 --> 17:21.449
Just like you haven't destroyed
the EF-11 formula, yet.

17:41.802 --> 17:44.221
The extra security guards
arrived a half-hour ago...

17:44.305 --> 17:46.182
and have been briefed, as have the staff.

17:46.265 --> 17:48.225
If she appears,
we'll have her, Mr. Harcourt.

17:48.309 --> 17:49.435
Good.

17:49.518 --> 17:50.895
And the Easton plant called.

17:50.978 --> 17:53.355
They're sending over
some classified material.

17:53.439 --> 17:55.107
That's fine.

18:01.155 --> 18:03.157
Place this in the inner office.

18:03.616 --> 18:07.161
After it's delivered,
I'd advise leaving the building quickly.

18:22.384 --> 18:24.303
Oh yes, he's expecting this.

18:24.678 --> 18:26.221
You may go right up.

18:35.355 --> 18:36.440
Hi.

18:36.523 --> 18:37.774
May I help you?

18:37.858 --> 18:40.110
I'd like to see Mr. Harcourt please.

18:41.194 --> 18:44.114
Mr. Harcourt has no appointments
for this morning.

18:44.531 --> 18:47.242
He's not really expecting me
at a certain time.

18:47.326 --> 18:49.411
- I've called, but-
- You've called?

18:49.494 --> 18:50.537
Yes.

18:50.620 --> 18:52.331
I told him I'd be here.

18:54.875 --> 18:57.711
I'm sure that Mr. Harcourt
will want to talk to me...

18:57.794 --> 18:59.629
when he finds out who I am.

19:00.505 --> 19:01.548
Guards!

19:03.758 --> 19:04.843
Stop her!

19:12.142 --> 19:14.644
Here's the package from the Easton plant,
Mr. Harcourt.

19:14.728 --> 19:16.021
Your eyes only.

19:16.521 --> 19:19.232
And sir, we just got a warning
from the lobby.

19:20.025 --> 19:22.402
- She's in the building?
- It appears so.

19:35.039 --> 19:36.124
Hi.

19:58.605 --> 20:00.023
You may leave us.

20:01.983 --> 20:04.944
What are you running here?
A business or an army?

20:05.361 --> 20:08.489
I'd prefer to keep this entire affair
away from the press.

20:08.573 --> 20:10.700
But if you fail to cooperate, I warn you.

20:10.783 --> 20:14.454
I have the power to have you locked up
for the rest of your life.

20:14.829 --> 20:16.831
Mr. Harcourt, you've made some mistake-

20:16.914 --> 20:20.334
And I will not be trifled with
by backward-thinking fanatics.

20:20.418 --> 20:24.130
If your guards would give me my purse,
I will show you my ID.

20:24.297 --> 20:26.716
You do not want ski resorts.

20:27.258 --> 20:28.968
You clamor against nuclear power.

20:29.051 --> 20:32.847
And you rail against all progress
in the name of ecology.

20:33.556 --> 20:34.682
Did you hear that?

20:34.765 --> 20:36.892
With the world on the edge of starvation...

20:36.976 --> 20:39.186
you will deprive it of the one pesticide...

20:39.270 --> 20:41.856
that would insure a continued food supply.

20:51.782 --> 20:52.867
What was that?

20:52.950 --> 20:54.910
It's coming from your office.

20:56.245 --> 20:57.705
What is happening?

21:25.399 --> 21:27.151
My Louis XIV table!

21:29.987 --> 21:32.531
My 19th-century walnut desk!

21:33.615 --> 21:35.200
What in the world...

21:36.201 --> 21:37.286
Ants.

21:39.580 --> 21:41.081
Ants, Mr. Harcourt.

21:48.505 --> 21:49.631
Ants.

22:08.108 --> 22:09.151
Relax.

22:09.526 --> 22:11.778
Take a little break on company time.

23:07.333 --> 23:09.752
- They're in.
- And so are we.

23:19.512 --> 23:21.139
It was amazing, Steve.

23:21.264 --> 23:25.226
Those ants seemed to be programmed
to destroy Harcourt's office.

23:25.601 --> 23:28.020
Harcourt was frightened enough
to admit to me that...

23:28.104 --> 23:31.232
someone was trying to make
him close the Easton plant.

23:31.315 --> 23:33.526
But not frightened enough to comply.

23:33.609 --> 23:36.445
Right. Which means that
whoever's behind this...

23:36.988 --> 23:38.906
will undoubtedly try something else.

23:38.990 --> 23:43.619
He or she is apparently determined to stop
Harcourt from marketing pesticide.

23:46.455 --> 23:47.540
Here comes our man.

23:47.623 --> 23:48.958
This must be from Ira.

23:49.041 --> 23:52.086
The information you asked for last night.
Let's see.

23:57.925 --> 23:59.343
Dr. Irene Janus...

23:59.718 --> 24:03.430
worked closely with Radcliffe
in developing the EF-11 formula.

24:03.889 --> 24:07.685
She's an entomologist with
an intense interest in ants.

24:08.477 --> 24:09.728
Look familiar?

24:14.567 --> 24:17.152
This is not the woman I saw
when Doug was kidnapped.

24:17.236 --> 24:20.489
In light of her former relationship
to him and her interest in ants...

24:20.572 --> 24:22.199
I think maybe I'd better go visiting.

24:22.282 --> 24:24.118
Got her address right here.

24:34.294 --> 24:35.921
What's wrong with him?

24:36.839 --> 24:39.675
Steve, take a look at this. Ants.

24:42.052 --> 24:43.095
You don't suppose that-

24:43.178 --> 24:46.849
I've heard of places being bugged before,
but this is ridiculous.

24:47.099 --> 24:49.434
How did he know that they were there?

24:49.643 --> 24:51.687
Our ever-faithful computer. Ira.

24:52.020 --> 24:55.983
Ira told me this morning that
he programmed the Rover to respond to...

24:56.108 --> 24:59.194
and even generate electronic patterns
emitted by ants.

24:59.987 --> 25:01.363
You mean that...

25:01.697 --> 25:03.657
he can communicate with them?

25:03.907 --> 25:05.534
In crude fashion, yes.

25:09.121 --> 25:12.707
In that case, little buddy,
we are about to take a trip.

25:21.258 --> 25:24.386
It seems that good Dr. Janus
is going to have company.

25:33.728 --> 25:37.774
Mr. Harcourt, you've got to look at
the latest analysis reports on EF-11.

25:38.400 --> 25:41.027
We've been testing it
on laboratory animals.

25:41.820 --> 25:43.613
I'm going out to the Easton plant.

25:43.697 --> 25:48.701
It has the potential of being more than
100 times as toxic as DDT, Mr. Harcourt.

25:51.621 --> 25:56.292
Countries intending to buy EF-11 will be
using a minimum of 3 pounds per acre.

25:56.459 --> 26:00.171
Roughly the equivalent of
300 pounds of DDT.

26:00.880 --> 26:02.465
It's supposed to be powerful.

26:02.549 --> 26:05.760
But when it combines with water
and specific pollutants...

26:05.843 --> 26:07.178
it becomes toxic.

26:07.262 --> 26:08.596
Not just to insects...

26:08.680 --> 26:10.974
but to wildlife and eventually to humans.

26:11.057 --> 26:12.558
The tests prove it.

26:12.934 --> 26:14.477
Then redo the tests.

26:15.103 --> 26:17.438
- What?
- Redo the tests.

26:53.015 --> 26:54.975
Rover, can you tell me if...

27:00.815 --> 27:01.899
Rover!

27:54.826 --> 27:57.162
I'll be with you in a moment, Diana.

27:59.831 --> 28:01.667
It's all right, Dr. Janus.

28:03.168 --> 28:05.170
Chopin is one of my favorites.

28:15.514 --> 28:17.682
It's not often I have an audience.

28:17.933 --> 28:19.226
Oh? Doesn't...

28:20.102 --> 28:22.062
Dr. Radcliffe like music?

28:23.355 --> 28:25.106
I know he's here, Doctor.

28:25.732 --> 28:29.444
I'm not certain why or how,
but I know that you kidnapped him.

28:29.528 --> 28:31.363
Just like I know that you're the one...

28:31.446 --> 28:34.115
making the threats
on Harcourt's pesticide plant.

28:34.199 --> 28:38.203
I'm afraid you're going to regret
your involvements in all this, Diana.

28:39.996 --> 28:42.791
The IADC is involved, not just me.

28:42.874 --> 28:44.584
And they know I'm here.

28:45.877 --> 28:48.129
We crusaders are a dangerous lot.

28:49.214 --> 28:50.340
Aldo!

28:50.799 --> 28:51.966
Right here.

29:12.862 --> 29:15.990
No one is to enter these gates today.
You hear? No one.

29:16.074 --> 29:17.158
Let's go.

29:31.089 --> 29:33.257
I can almost hear the questions...

29:33.591 --> 29:36.469
going round and round
in your respective heads:

29:37.512 --> 29:38.971
How can a plain...

29:39.514 --> 29:40.598
passive...

29:40.681 --> 29:42.725
mousy little person like her...

29:43.142 --> 29:46.604
expect to make GDH Enterprises
knuckle under?

29:52.401 --> 29:54.362
Here, ladies and gentlemen...

29:58.407 --> 29:59.909
here's your answer.

30:00.701 --> 30:02.286
A hormonal formula...

30:04.580 --> 30:07.583
I developed from
my ant friends themselves.

31:13.357 --> 31:16.026
Being so weak and shy...

31:16.109 --> 31:18.987
is what interested me in ants
in the first place.

31:21.281 --> 31:25.827
This potion helps me unlock those
latent and natural abilities in myself...

31:26.703 --> 31:29.706
which coincide with those of the ants.

31:31.791 --> 31:33.502
Hymenoptera: Formicidae.

31:34.127 --> 31:35.962
They're everything I'm not:

31:36.129 --> 31:37.255
Social...

31:37.339 --> 31:38.757
well-organized...

31:39.382 --> 31:41.343
purposeful, and strong.

31:41.843 --> 31:45.221
Did you know an ant can lift
over 50 times its body weight?

31:48.767 --> 31:50.352
What's the matter, Doug?

31:50.435 --> 31:52.145
I'm still not your type?

31:52.604 --> 31:53.855
What a shame.

31:54.147 --> 31:55.982
Why haven't you put this...

31:56.649 --> 31:57.859
discovery...

31:58.026 --> 32:01.237
- to good use instead of-
- I am putting it to good use.

32:01.488 --> 32:03.823
Go on, Doug, tell her what I'm doing!

32:04.657 --> 32:06.409
What's she talking about?

32:07.577 --> 32:11.831
The EF-11 pesticide formula.
I sold it too soon.

32:12.415 --> 32:15.210
What he sold Harcourt
was an incomplete formula.

32:15.293 --> 32:17.837
Incomplete because in its present form...

32:17.921 --> 32:20.548
EF-11, when saturated
with ordinary water...

32:20.632 --> 32:24.677
and exposed to airborne sulfates,
becomes a deadly poison.

32:27.096 --> 32:29.349
Our tests weren't really conclusive.

32:29.766 --> 32:33.936
Not when you sold out to Harcourt for
over $1 million worth of nightlife.

32:34.604 --> 32:35.855
But mine were.

32:36.064 --> 32:37.482
Two months later.

32:38.091 --> 32:42.101
Within four years, EF-11 will seep into
the food chain of those countries...

32:42.136 --> 32:44.697
using it and cause
irreversible damage.

32:45.156 --> 32:47.325
It'll make DDT look like nothing.

32:47.575 --> 32:49.785
Harcourt starts marketing it today.

32:50.286 --> 32:51.996
I'll help you stop him.

32:52.538 --> 32:56.042
I found out the surest way
to see that something doesn't get done...

32:56.125 --> 32:58.544
is to trust it to government bureaucrats.

32:58.628 --> 32:59.962
Cawley, Aldo.

33:04.008 --> 33:05.092
No.

33:06.385 --> 33:08.012
I've made other plans.

33:22.109 --> 33:23.194
Goodbye.

33:39.752 --> 33:41.337
They're flesh-eaters.

33:41.962 --> 33:46.800
Doug, I want you to untie my hands
and I'll get us both out of this.

33:46.884 --> 33:49.261
There's no way. I can't reach you.

34:35.556 --> 34:38.810
- Move the chair over.
- That's not going to help for very long.

34:38.893 --> 34:40.437
It might just do it.

34:44.190 --> 34:45.275
Rover?

34:51.614 --> 34:52.699
The ants.

34:52.866 --> 34:54.701
Tell them to stop. Can you?

35:19.893 --> 35:21.728
Cavalry in computer form?

35:23.730 --> 35:24.939
Don't knock it.

35:25.023 --> 35:27.692
I'm not. There you go.

35:29.569 --> 35:31.029
Rover, I love you.

35:33.781 --> 35:36.826
Call Steve Trevor at the IADC,
and tell him what's happened here.

35:36.909 --> 35:39.912
Tell him to see that the Easton plant
is evacuated immediately.

35:39.996 --> 35:41.789
I'm sure that's where they went.

35:41.873 --> 35:44.083
There were ants in those things
she was carrying.

35:44.167 --> 35:47.170
She must intend to destroy the plant
like she did those buildings.

35:47.253 --> 35:49.505
What about you? Are you gonna be okay?

35:49.589 --> 35:51.048
I'll be all right.

35:51.591 --> 35:54.135
I've got the cavalry on my side,
remember?

36:05.062 --> 36:08.274
We're ready to pump the mixture
into the tanks at the loading dock.

36:08.357 --> 36:09.942
Good.

36:29.962 --> 36:32.506
Mr. Harcourt, the plant manager
just got a call, sir...

36:32.590 --> 36:35.634
from the IADC,
ordering us to evacuate the plant.

36:36.552 --> 36:37.970
Probably just another crank call.

36:38.053 --> 36:42.433
- No, sir. He said Steve Trevor told him-
- It was just another crank call!

36:43.726 --> 36:44.935
Yes, sir.

36:48.647 --> 36:50.024
- All set.
- Good.

36:50.357 --> 36:54.403
The few hundred ants you placed inside
will muster a force of 10 million.

36:54.486 --> 36:55.571
Why do you have to go in?

36:55.654 --> 36:57.698
Can't you signal the ants from out here?

36:57.781 --> 36:59.450
Destroying the building isn't enough.

36:59.533 --> 37:02.035
I've got to neutralize the pesticides...

37:02.119 --> 37:03.704
that he's already manufactured.

37:03.787 --> 37:06.915
If it spills,
it'll poison everything within 10 miles.

37:44.661 --> 37:47.247
Come on, Rover.
We've gotta save the plant.

38:05.098 --> 38:07.600
Okay, little buddy, do your stuff.

38:31.583 --> 38:32.625
Empty.

38:34.752 --> 38:36.838
Do you think you can find those ants...

38:36.921 --> 38:39.799
and tell them to stop,
like you did at the house?

38:43.136 --> 38:44.846
All right. You're sure?

38:59.902 --> 39:01.445
I want you to hurry.

39:02.280 --> 39:03.531
And be careful.

39:17.294 --> 39:18.379
Hey, you!

40:09.930 --> 40:12.015
Nobody's supposed to be in here!

40:48.385 --> 40:49.886
Are you going to tell me...

40:49.970 --> 40:52.764
that you have not received orders
to evacuate this building?

40:52.848 --> 40:56.017
I will not be harassed into
abandoning my endeavors by you...

40:56.101 --> 40:57.602
the IADC, or anyone else.

40:57.686 --> 40:58.812
Harassed?

40:58.895 --> 41:01.940
This whole building
is about to come down, Mr. Harcourt.

41:02.023 --> 41:04.275
Stop your operations and evacuate.

41:04.985 --> 41:06.152
That sound!

41:22.836 --> 41:26.798
Diana Prince has proof that the pesticide
you're about to market is toxic.

41:26.881 --> 41:29.884
Do you really want manslaughter
on your conscience?

41:31.052 --> 41:33.263
Have the people clear the building.

41:37.475 --> 41:38.601
Come on!

42:31.779 --> 42:35.533
- Is everyone out of the building?
- Somebody's in the control room!

42:59.890 --> 43:01.558
Come on, you have to get out of here.

43:01.642 --> 43:04.645
No! The pesticide has to be neutralized!

43:04.728 --> 43:07.856
Help me, please! Help me!

43:12.903 --> 43:13.987
Let me.

43:27.042 --> 43:28.210
Two thousand!

43:28.293 --> 43:31.922
The temperature of the mixture
has to reach 2,000!

43:42.933 --> 43:44.017
Come on!

43:49.689 --> 43:50.816
We did it!

43:52.192 --> 43:53.235
Come on.

43:53.360 --> 43:57.030
No, it's too late.
We'll never get out. Ever.

44:15.965 --> 44:17.217
What happened?

44:30.980 --> 44:33.733
I believe it's the cavalry, Dr. Janus.

44:49.916 --> 44:51.417
Renie, you're safe.

44:51.584 --> 44:53.294
And you're Renie again.

44:53.753 --> 44:55.463
Sorry to disappoint you.

44:56.172 --> 44:57.215
No, look...

44:57.298 --> 44:59.675
I'm sorry for everything I did to you.

45:00.176 --> 45:03.513
You had to become that creature
for the things that I did.

45:03.638 --> 45:05.681
I'm responsible for everything.

45:06.307 --> 45:08.267
Save it for the judge, Doctor.

45:09.227 --> 45:10.937
Maybe you'll get lucky.

45:11.103 --> 45:13.523
Maybe the court will assign you a woman.

45:13.606 --> 45:16.150
I'm the one who's responsible for this...

45:16.359 --> 45:18.361
and the buildings and for her.

45:19.278 --> 45:21.447
I intend to face up to everything.

45:22.573 --> 45:24.617
But do you think, after I do...

45:24.700 --> 45:27.203
that maybe you'll help me to start over?

45:29.205 --> 45:31.457
This can make you forget...

45:31.540 --> 45:34.543
how you created Formicida,
if that's what you want.

45:34.668 --> 45:36.128
It certainly is.

45:47.556 --> 45:51.227
You know, I can't figure out
why that building is still standing.

45:53.479 --> 45:54.730
I'll show you.

46:25.511 --> 46:27.471
He talked the ants out of it?

46:28.847 --> 46:31.683
Diana always said
he has a way with words.
