00:48.501 --> 00:49.991
You know the girl.

00:50.337 --> 00:53.135
Your first real vision of beauty.

00:53.373 --> 00:56.274
The one that all other girls
have to measure up to.

00:56.509 --> 00:59.672
Class, we have a new student today.

00:59.913 --> 01:01.676
Her name is Cristabel.

01:01.915 --> 01:04.247
Everyone say hi to Cristabel.

01:04.483 --> 01:07.044
Hi, Cristabel.

01:09.389 --> 01:10.720
The heavens opened.

01:10.957 --> 01:12.219
And that was it.

01:12.859 --> 01:15.794
The moment l first fell in love.

01:20.033 --> 01:21.466
You know the girl.

01:21.801 --> 01:23.325
The one you run to so you can

01:23.570 --> 01:27.062
breathlessly declare
your undying love.

02:04.411 --> 02:07.346
But things don't always work out
the way you think they will...

02:07.580 --> 02:09.604
...when you're six years old.

02:19.125 --> 02:22.526
She cries at commercials by AT&T.

02:22.762 --> 02:25.822
She sobs at the videos on MTV.

02:26.066 --> 02:29.695
But she says it's got nothing
to do with me...

02:29.936 --> 02:33.667
She's just an emotional girl.

02:33.907 --> 02:37.468
She rips off my suits and
cuts off the sleeves.

02:37.711 --> 02:41.203
And shaves my head while
l'm fast asleep.

02:41.448 --> 02:43.939
Sometimes l feel
she's the princess

02:44.184 --> 02:47.381
and l'm just the pea...

02:48.688 --> 02:51.885
And she's just an emotional girl.

02:52.125 --> 02:54.355
Just an emotional...

02:54.594 --> 02:55.686
You want the guitar?

03:03.903 --> 03:08.704
ls...is everything okay...honey?

03:08.942 --> 03:10.534
You just don't get it, do you.

03:10.777 --> 03:11.835
l don't know.

03:12.078 --> 03:16.014
Your songs, which suck,
by the way...

03:16.316 --> 03:18.307
Are always about things l did.

03:18.551 --> 03:20.746
They're not about you being
in love with me.

03:20.987 --> 03:24.821
They're always about lalalalala
Jane shaved my head.

03:25.558 --> 03:26.786
But you did.

03:27.026 --> 03:27.890
And it's fine.

03:28.128 --> 03:29.595
We can laugh about it now,
sweetie.

03:29.829 --> 03:32.889
Why do you think
l spray painted your car?

03:33.700 --> 03:34.894
And l know this one.

03:36.569 --> 03:39.936
Because you were mad?

03:40.974 --> 03:42.305
l'm leaving....

03:42.776 --> 03:45.802
And l'm taking my drawer.

03:48.548 --> 03:49.173
Fuck this.

03:49.416 --> 03:51.247
For all l've put up with,

03:51.484 --> 03:54.044
l seem to deserve better
than this.

03:58.725 --> 04:01.216
Jane...okay, okay, um...

04:02.896 --> 04:05.387
-Listen, listen, listen...
-What?

04:05.899 --> 04:08.424
Are you going to keep
the actual drawer?

04:08.668 --> 04:11.068
-You're an asshole!
-No. Okay, okay, okay.

04:11.304 --> 04:12.236
You can keep it.

04:12.472 --> 04:14.906
l just don't know what to do
with the rest of it

04:16.209 --> 04:17.437
Come on.

04:18.445 --> 04:21.107
Okay...Jane, you see?

04:21.548 --> 04:24.244
l came all the way
down the stairs.

04:26.419 --> 04:30.185
Stop. Please, please,
please stop. Wait.

04:33.927 --> 04:35.360
Let's talk.

04:37.063 --> 04:39.497
This is not talking.

04:47.941 --> 04:50.466
You don't know what it's
like to be in love with someone

04:50.710 --> 04:53.577
for years and
have absolutely no idea

04:53.813 --> 04:55.747
if they're ever
going to love you back.

05:05.525 --> 05:07.891
You're a loser, Nate Cooper.

05:09.429 --> 05:11.397
And that's when it hit me.

05:12.065 --> 05:14.625
Yes, she may have overreacted...

05:14.868 --> 05:16.631
But Jane was right.

05:16.936 --> 05:20.235
No other girl would ever
make me happy.

05:24.310 --> 05:26.778
Cristabel Abbott was the one.

05:41.628 --> 05:45.894
But how could l have known the
hurdles l would have to overcome.

05:50.970 --> 05:53.268
l have a valentine for you
in my backpack.

05:53.573 --> 05:56.371
We just haven't had a chance to
give ours out yet.

06:02.482 --> 06:04.677
l knew l had to find her.

06:05.051 --> 06:07.519
And l knew just who to go to.

06:11.491 --> 06:13.789
My best friend from first grade.

06:14.027 --> 06:16.587
Who shared in the glories
that were Cristabel

06:16.863 --> 06:18.990
and the art of nose picking.

06:19.499 --> 06:21.364
Arno Blount.

06:21.668 --> 06:23.465
Are you tired of doing
hundreds of ab exercises...

06:23.703 --> 06:25.637
and not getting the flat
stomach you want?

06:25.872 --> 06:27.601
Well, it's time to stop, America...

06:27.840 --> 06:30.331
Because you've been
going the wrong way.

06:30.577 --> 06:31.202
That's right, America.

06:31.444 --> 06:33.275
You've been going the wrong way.

06:33.513 --> 06:35.481
Now there's my Ab Away Pro System.

06:35.715 --> 06:37.774
Designed with reverse ab action.

06:38.017 --> 06:38.813
The fastest, easiest way
to have firm, flat abs.

06:39.052 --> 06:40.485
lt's all the same.

06:41.421 --> 06:45.084
My Arno just loves holiday candies.

06:45.358 --> 06:47.656
So we stock them up year round.

06:47.894 --> 06:49.521
They make me feel happy.

06:49.862 --> 06:53.161
Can l get you a Courvasier

06:53.399 --> 06:56.459
or cocoa?

06:56.970 --> 06:58.801
No thank you, Ms. Blount.

06:59.038 --> 07:00.471
l'm fine.

07:01.274 --> 07:03.265
So you got a degree
in art history, huh?

07:03.509 --> 07:05.739
Uh...yeah.

07:05.979 --> 07:07.446
That means unemployed, right?

07:07.680 --> 07:09.341
-Pretty much, yeah.
-Cool.

07:09.582 --> 07:11.413
Means a lot more time to hang, huh?

07:11.851 --> 07:15.719
-Okay.
-So, you want to know

07:15.955 --> 07:18.321
what happened to Cristabel Abbott.

07:18.558 --> 07:20.321
Well, yeah.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.721
Well, l'm curious to know

07:22.962 --> 07:25.089
how everyone's doing
after all these years.

07:25.331 --> 07:27.561
Everyone...Right.

07:27.900 --> 07:30.232
Well, my friend, you came
to the right place.

07:31.938 --> 07:34.463
Wow, that's Cristabel?

07:34.707 --> 07:35.731
-Yep.
-You know,

07:35.975 --> 07:38.808
"cause usually 13's a bad age.

07:39.045 --> 07:43.175
From the first grade on,
she just got hotter every year.

07:44.851 --> 07:46.341
That's weird.

07:47.453 --> 07:50.081
Dear lord...Oh God.

07:50.323 --> 07:52.723
-ls that...uh...
-June Phigg.

07:53.092 --> 07:54.491
The nottie.

07:55.395 --> 07:56.919
Ooh...nottie?

07:57.163 --> 07:58.494
lt's a very well known
law of physics.

07:58.731 --> 08:00.790
The hotness of one girl is
directly proportional

08:01.034 --> 08:03.093
to the ugliness of
her best friend.

08:03.436 --> 08:05.666
Wow. June Phigg.

08:06.906 --> 08:10.000
lt's sort of sweet they've
stayed friends all these years.

08:10.243 --> 08:11.232
Sweet?

08:11.477 --> 08:15.379
She's like some hideous dragon
guarding the princess from escape.

08:22.789 --> 08:24.222
What?

08:24.791 --> 08:27.055
ln order to
gain access to the hottie

08:27.293 --> 08:29.727
The nottie must be appeased.

08:29.962 --> 08:31.793
You're saying
that June is the reason

08:32.030 --> 08:33.259
why Cristabel's still single?

08:33.499 --> 08:34.693
Of course she is!

08:34.933 --> 08:37.767
That, my friend,
is the whole purpose of the nottie.

08:38.004 --> 08:40.666
Cristabel Abbott is the hottest
woman in Los Angeles.

08:40.907 --> 08:42.568
But no man will ever win her heart

08:42.808 --> 08:45.039
without getting past
that monstrosity.

08:45.278 --> 08:48.873
And she will destroy you.

08:50.416 --> 08:54.182
No. No. This is fate.

08:54.420 --> 08:57.583
Fate is the reason
she is still single.

08:57.824 --> 09:00.349
Look. l came 3000 miles
to get this girl

09:00.593 --> 09:03.858
And it's going to take a lot more
than a June Phigg to stop me.

09:05.298 --> 09:06.925
l like your moxie.

09:07.166 --> 09:08.758
Yeah? Good.

09:09.168 --> 09:11.033
You're gonna
need to see the file.

09:11.270 --> 09:12.498
Ma!

09:12.739 --> 09:13.967
Bring out the file!

09:14.207 --> 09:15.834
Coming, precious.

09:16.375 --> 09:17.672
She loves it.

09:19.312 --> 09:21.872
The hottie and her every move.

09:23.049 --> 09:25.609
This whole thing is about
Cristabel Abbott?

09:25.852 --> 09:27.217
You should see the website.

09:27.687 --> 09:30.247
Now, according to my records

09:30.490 --> 09:33.516
She has a two mile jog every
morning past the Santa Monica pier.

09:33.760 --> 09:35.352
She stops
at Danny's Beachside Cafe

09:35.595 --> 09:38.428
for a light breakfast of ice
buttered mocha and fruit salad.

09:38.698 --> 09:43.499
She'll pass the north end of the
pier between 6:15 and 6:18 a.m.

09:43.736 --> 09:46.899
Benches that face the ocean are
the best ones to view her from.

09:47.140 --> 09:48.937
"Cause if you face the other way,
the sun gets in your eyes

09:49.175 --> 09:50.836
..and you lose the whole thing.

10:32.051 --> 10:33.075
Hey guys.

10:37.290 --> 10:38.780
Here she comes.

10:49.468 --> 10:51.766
Konichiwa. Good morning.

11:01.214 --> 11:02.442
Hi guys.

11:02.682 --> 11:04.172
l love you.

11:17.630 --> 11:19.222
Good morning.

11:30.676 --> 11:33.304
Oh my god, l'm so sorry.

11:33.913 --> 11:35.505
Were you sniffing me?

11:36.515 --> 11:37.812
Sorry.

11:39.051 --> 11:41.519
Hey, aren't you Cristabel Abbott?

11:41.754 --> 11:44.689
-Yeah.
-l think we went to school together.

11:44.924 --> 11:46.482
Back in the first grade.

11:47.727 --> 11:50.525
Were you that guy who used to
put Vienna sausage in his pants?

11:50.763 --> 11:55.029
No. The guy with processed meats
that was Jay Gray.

11:57.069 --> 12:00.038
You're not that kid who used to
stick pencils up his nose, are you?

12:00.273 --> 12:01.433
No, that was my friend, Arno.

12:01.674 --> 12:02.971
Nice guy.

12:05.444 --> 12:10.575
lf we went to first grade together,
and Arno only had one friend...

12:11.183 --> 12:15.517
You must be Nate Cooper.

12:23.095 --> 12:24.323
l don't want to alarm you...

12:24.563 --> 12:27.726
but there's
a really creepy albino guy

12:27.967 --> 12:29.798
standing outside the window.

12:31.771 --> 12:34.103
Oh, that's just my stalker,
Randy.

12:34.340 --> 12:35.864
He's completely harmless.

12:36.108 --> 12:38.736
Randall,
that better be 40 feet away.

12:43.649 --> 12:44.980
So where were we?

12:45.217 --> 12:46.582
Right. My job.

12:46.852 --> 12:49.184
l work as an event planner for
this charity group...

12:49.422 --> 12:53.153
which basically means l get to
throw fun parties for a good cause.

12:53.492 --> 12:54.516
Cool.

12:56.295 --> 12:59.560
And...l'm pregnant.

12:59.899 --> 13:02.367
l'm not sure whose it is,
unfortunately.

13:02.802 --> 13:06.067
Oh, l'm so sorry.

13:06.605 --> 13:07.867
l'm kidding.

13:08.107 --> 13:10.302
No kids, no boyfriend.

13:10.543 --> 13:12.010
No action of any kind.

13:12.244 --> 13:13.711
Oh, good.

13:14.313 --> 13:15.780
Or not.

13:16.048 --> 13:18.209
So what do you do now?

13:18.451 --> 13:20.885
Or are you still into finger
painting and Smurfs.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.179
No, no l um...

13:23.456 --> 13:29.656
l'm a personal trainer.

13:30.763 --> 13:32.458
You're a personal trainer.

13:33.366 --> 13:34.697
Yeah.

13:35.167 --> 13:37.192
Like a gym?

13:37.436 --> 13:38.733
A lot of people mistake
personal fitness

13:38.971 --> 13:41.496
for being brought up
with roid rage.

13:41.741 --> 13:44.938
But who wants adult acne
and a shrunken penis.

13:45.177 --> 13:46.439
Not me.

13:47.446 --> 13:54.909
No, it's a mind, body,
spirit sort of lifestyle.

13:55.187 --> 13:56.677
You are what you eat.

13:56.956 --> 13:58.287
And whatnot.

13:58.524 --> 14:00.082
You should check out my gym.

14:00.326 --> 14:03.591
Actually, my roommate and l are
going there this afternoon for yoga.

14:03.829 --> 14:05.729
So do you want to come?

14:06.399 --> 14:07.957
Absolutely.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.566
My roommate. lt's June.

14:11.170 --> 14:12.797
From the first grade.

14:15.441 --> 14:19.104
Wow...June...Yeah.

14:19.345 --> 14:20.869
June's into heath.

14:21.113 --> 14:22.102
She's a vegan.

14:22.348 --> 14:24.646
Everything she eats is non-fat.

14:25.017 --> 14:27.815
Oh...how delicious.

14:28.054 --> 14:30.522
l'm so glad we ran into
each other, Nate.

14:30.990 --> 14:32.355
Me too.

14:32.691 --> 14:34.556
So the gym is at 6th and Ocean.

14:34.794 --> 14:38.753
Here's my number
if you forget the address.

14:50.810 --> 14:53.608
There. Now you can't lose it.

15:18.137 --> 15:19.502
Hey, Cooper.

15:21.006 --> 15:22.405
Hey.

15:27.580 --> 15:29.309
You remember June.

15:35.187 --> 15:36.449
Oh God...

15:37.823 --> 15:39.256
Of course.

15:39.492 --> 15:43.553
Yes. Who could forget the
lovely...June?

15:43.796 --> 15:45.696
-Oh, Jeanette.
-How are you?

15:45.931 --> 15:47.421
-How are you?
-Good to see you.

15:49.101 --> 15:51.399
-You look beautiful.
-Thank you.

16:00.379 --> 16:01.641
Sorry.

16:01.881 --> 16:03.371
Nice.

16:04.483 --> 16:08.351
June and l don't get much action,
so we take what we can get.

16:08.621 --> 16:10.020
Grab a spot.

16:29.408 --> 16:32.639
So Nate here has become a
personal trainer.

16:32.912 --> 16:34.675
Oh, yeah. But you know what?

16:34.914 --> 16:36.074
Enough about me.

16:36.315 --> 16:39.648
June, what do you do?

16:40.152 --> 16:42.052
June's a handler at the zoo.

16:42.288 --> 16:43.755
That's great.

16:43.989 --> 16:48.119
The only downside is l'm
constantly covered in hair.

16:49.028 --> 16:51.189
Not that l don't already have
enough to begin with.

16:51.430 --> 16:53.625
June has a lot of problems
with hair removal.

16:53.866 --> 16:55.458
l have sensitive skin.

16:55.801 --> 16:56.768
Oh.

16:57.002 --> 16:58.936
l mean, l've tried it all...

16:59.572 --> 17:04.474
Shaving, bumps and ingrown
hairs...Nair.

17:04.910 --> 17:06.400
Nasty chemical reaction.

17:06.645 --> 17:11.513
The only thing l can really do
is Joleen Cream---bleach.

17:11.750 --> 17:12.478
You know what?

17:12.718 --> 17:15.585
lf you hadn't said anything,
l wouldn't have noticed.

17:17.990 --> 17:20.356
Uh, not that l've noticed now.

17:20.659 --> 17:22.455
l'm not focusing on that at all.

17:22.694 --> 17:24.788
lt's natural.

17:25.030 --> 17:25.655
Everybody has it.

17:25.897 --> 17:26.865
Everybody deals with it.

17:27.098 --> 17:28.361
l've got hair.

17:28.767 --> 17:30.064
Okay everyone.

17:30.302 --> 17:33.465
Let's begin with
downward facing dog.

17:33.706 --> 17:37.164
-Adamucha Svenasama.
-Shit.

17:48.654 --> 17:50.554
All right.

17:59.531 --> 18:04.127
And easing into cat pose.

18:06.338 --> 18:08.863
And arching your back.

18:09.875 --> 18:13.675
And moving into downward
facing dog.

18:21.520 --> 18:24.717
Beautiful form, Cristabel.

18:39.271 --> 18:42.763
Oh, that was amazing.

18:47.479 --> 18:51.643
So, Cris,
now that l'm back in town

18:52.051 --> 18:56.852
l thought it'd be wonderful
if maybe you and l could

18:57.189 --> 19:00.454
go out to dinner...maybe.

19:01.026 --> 19:02.493
Yeah, that'd be fun.

19:02.728 --> 19:03.717
Yeah?

19:03.962 --> 19:06.328
But the timing's terrible.

19:06.665 --> 19:09.930
Nate, it probably won't come as
a huge surprise to you...

19:10.302 --> 19:12.862
But June's never had a boyfriend.

19:20.245 --> 19:22.679
-No.
-Yeah.

19:23.716 --> 19:28.346
And all through school,
l went out with any guy who asked.

19:28.654 --> 19:31.088
l didn't know the meaning
of the word "no'.

19:31.457 --> 19:34.119
Sounds like l shouldn't
have left town then.

19:35.294 --> 19:38.354
That's why l made
a promise to myself.

19:38.597 --> 19:40.292
l'm not going to date
anyone again

19:40.566 --> 19:43.399
till June has someone special
in her life.

19:44.203 --> 19:44.862
Wow.

19:45.104 --> 19:48.335
That is...admirable.

19:49.708 --> 19:55.476
But that could be a very,
very long time.

19:55.948 --> 20:01.045
lt's just...the hard part
is going without the sex.

20:04.056 --> 20:05.648
Don't take it personally, Coopie.

20:05.924 --> 20:07.619
You're a great guy.

20:08.026 --> 20:10.187
And if things were different...

20:10.763 --> 20:12.628
Who knows?

20:13.799 --> 20:15.061
l gotta go.

20:16.935 --> 20:19.301
But maybe l'll see you later.

20:20.072 --> 20:23.200
-Yeah. l'll see you...later.
-Goodbye.

20:26.678 --> 20:29.044
She's not only smoking hot...

20:29.281 --> 20:31.545
She's also extremely horny.

20:31.784 --> 20:35.652
And for some unknown reason,
l think she likes me.

20:36.155 --> 20:38.316
l've got to find a guy for June.

20:38.557 --> 20:40.081
There's somebody out there
for her.

20:40.325 --> 20:41.986
There's someone for everyone.

20:42.327 --> 20:43.351
Boys!

20:43.429 --> 20:46.364
Mom. Nate thinks he can
fix up the nottie.

20:47.466 --> 20:49.457
She's got fur on her toes.

20:49.701 --> 20:50.963
Mom!

20:51.203 --> 20:54.969
l understand she has a little
problem with hair removal.

20:55.307 --> 20:56.797
Has she tried the new lasers?

20:57.042 --> 20:59.272
Worked great on my bikini line.

20:59.511 --> 21:01.206
Grew back in like peach fuzz.

21:01.447 --> 21:02.573
That's true.

21:03.148 --> 21:04.080
But what are you going to do?

21:04.316 --> 21:05.840
Laser her whole body?

21:06.084 --> 21:06.880
l mean, you have any idea

21:07.119 --> 21:08.643
what kind of radiation
that would entail?

21:08.887 --> 21:10.821
What if l tell her that
she won a makeover?

21:11.757 --> 21:13.850
Send her to a spa, pretty her up.

21:14.092 --> 21:14.786
Somebody'll take her.

21:15.027 --> 21:15.755
Please.

21:15.994 --> 21:16.653
You want to flip this chick

21:16.895 --> 21:19.090
you're gonna have to do a lot
more than just mow the lawn.

21:20.999 --> 21:21.897
l got it!

21:23.168 --> 21:26.069
What if l pay somebody
to go out with her?

21:26.638 --> 21:28.333
Pause.

21:28.907 --> 21:31.467
Look, you think l
haven't been trying?

21:31.710 --> 21:32.199
All right.

21:32.444 --> 21:33.911
This isn't about a single date.

21:34.146 --> 21:36.478
This is about somebody special
in her life, okay?

21:36.715 --> 21:38.876
And you ain't got that
kind of blood money, my man.

21:39.284 --> 21:40.649
Arno.

21:41.420 --> 21:45.379
The history of mankind
is filled with men saying

21:45.624 --> 21:47.615
that something cannot be done.

21:47.860 --> 21:52.957
who are frequently interrupted by
someone who is already doing it.

21:53.432 --> 21:55.093
What does that even mean?

21:55.534 --> 21:56.330
l don't know.

21:56.568 --> 21:58.502
l saw it on your wall back there.

21:59.938 --> 22:01.269
That is a beautiful blouse.

22:01.507 --> 22:03.532
Thank you. l don't even know
what they're made of,

22:03.775 --> 22:05.037
but they're wonderful.

22:05.277 --> 22:08.246
Thanks. He's sweet.

22:14.753 --> 22:16.448
The reason l asked you
to meet me here...

22:16.688 --> 22:19.486
-And like l said...
-lt's not a date. l know.

22:19.725 --> 22:23.627
l couldn't even think about
selfish desires like that.

22:23.862 --> 22:28.196
l am just too concerned
about June.

22:28.534 --> 22:30.468
You've really been thinking
about June.

22:30.702 --> 22:32.226
Yeah.

22:34.273 --> 22:35.672
That's so sweet.

22:35.908 --> 22:39.810
And l gotta tell you
l am sickened by the fact

22:40.045 --> 22:42.343
that none of these narrow
minded assholes

22:42.581 --> 22:45.345
can see how beautiful she is just

22:45.584 --> 22:48.849
"cause they can't get past
some infected toenails

22:49.087 --> 22:52.352
and some backne, you know.

22:52.591 --> 22:53.319
l know.

22:53.559 --> 22:55.322
l feel the same way.

22:55.561 --> 23:01.932
And l think l have found
the perfect guy for her.

23:02.167 --> 23:03.600
What's his name?

23:04.069 --> 23:05.400
Who?

23:05.938 --> 23:08.566
The guy that's perfect for June.

23:08.907 --> 23:09.805
That guy.

23:10.042 --> 23:12.169
His name is...

23:13.879 --> 23:17.315
Cole Slaw...son.

23:17.549 --> 23:18.743
Cole Slawsen.

23:18.984 --> 23:21.544
A good friend, of a friend.

23:21.787 --> 23:22.845
And that guy's name is Mike.

23:23.088 --> 23:25.249
All real.

23:25.490 --> 23:27.720
So it's the four of us.

23:27.993 --> 23:30.621
Wouldn't you consider
that a double date?

23:31.330 --> 23:34.390
Well, we can throw
them in the pit together

23:34.633 --> 23:36.624
and hope they come out alive.

23:37.469 --> 23:43.101
Or we could lead them
into a friendship that

23:43.342 --> 23:46.436
blossoms into a lifetime of love

23:46.678 --> 23:50.011
lt would be a major step
if we could get her laid.

23:50.616 --> 23:51.173
Right.

23:51.416 --> 23:54.613
The whole lifetime of love
thing would just be a bonus.

23:54.920 --> 23:57.650
lt's just that...she never has...

23:58.023 --> 24:03.859
And l think a life without orgasms
is like a world without flowers.

24:07.899 --> 24:10.595
l couldn't agree with you more.

24:41.266 --> 24:43.200
Yeah, l do. l do.

24:50.075 --> 24:51.838
No. No. Go.

24:52.077 --> 24:54.011
Ewww. Gross.

25:00.419 --> 25:02.216
Other side.

25:02.854 --> 25:04.378
Oh yeah.

25:07.492 --> 25:09.187
Take it.

25:31.483 --> 25:32.814
Okay, listen.

25:33.051 --> 25:34.882
-No. No.
-Okay.

25:35.620 --> 25:36.382
What if l were to tell you

25:36.621 --> 25:38.145
that you could still
make the $500 bucks

25:38.390 --> 25:42.258
but all you had to do was go out
on a few dates with a woman.

25:44.730 --> 25:46.288
Does she have a vagina?

25:46.531 --> 25:48.021
Yeah.

25:48.266 --> 25:52.225
Actually, you're gonna have to
let me know if it goes that far?

25:53.905 --> 25:57.898
ls this woman you in a dress?

25:58.143 --> 26:00.907
No. No. This is a real woman.

26:01.146 --> 26:04.013
But l have to be honest.

26:04.249 --> 26:07.480
She's not necessarily pretty.

26:08.553 --> 26:09.850
None of my girlfriends
have been pretty.

26:10.088 --> 26:11.316
Good.

26:15.927 --> 26:17.155
This is nice.

26:23.502 --> 26:26.130
l'm gonna have her legs
behind her head.

26:26.371 --> 26:27.804
Get her dude.

26:30.809 --> 26:33.903
Oh, these are shoulder blades.

26:36.515 --> 26:38.312
l thought they were wings.

26:38.550 --> 26:40.484
l noticed you from across the bar.

26:40.719 --> 26:42.311
And do you know what the
first thing l thought was?

26:42.554 --> 26:46.046
Her daddy must be a baker "cause
she's got such a nice set of buns?

26:46.291 --> 26:47.758
Do you really think
that all it takes

26:47.993 --> 26:51.656
is a few hair plugs
some porcelain veneers

26:51.897 --> 26:56.129
$250 jeans...to impress a girl
like Cris?

26:56.768 --> 26:58.235
Or didn't that occur to you

26:58.470 --> 27:01.234
while you were schlepping away
your days at the Porsche dealership.

27:01.473 --> 27:03.839
to afford a few more of those
personal enhancements

27:04.075 --> 27:04.598
Which, by the way,

27:04.843 --> 27:07.311
will never hide that you
haven't been laid by anybody

27:07.546 --> 27:09.446
you haven't had to pay for
in over a year.

27:09.681 --> 27:12.616
So why don't you and your starry
head full of doll's hair

27:12.851 --> 27:15.319
take a little walk back to the bar,
have another shot of Jager

27:15.554 --> 27:19.285
And give my friend some space in
case a real man comes by, huh?

27:20.559 --> 27:23.221
Who told you
l used to sell Porsches?

27:23.695 --> 27:24.787
What?

27:27.866 --> 27:29.424
What'd l tell you?

27:29.668 --> 27:31.863
Pay our bar tab, bitch.

27:32.103 --> 27:33.468
What did she say?

27:37.409 --> 27:39.104
Oh god, they're here.

27:39.344 --> 27:40.572
Oh my god, they're here.

27:40.812 --> 27:42.074
God, l'm so nervous.

27:42.314 --> 27:43.212
Don't be nervous.

27:43.448 --> 27:44.938
Just do as l said.

27:45.183 --> 27:46.115
Right.

27:46.351 --> 27:47.682
Keep drinking.

27:48.086 --> 27:50.987
Well that...and just be yourself.

27:51.590 --> 27:53.251
-Okay?
-Okay.

27:55.193 --> 27:57.320
Steal yourself, Cole Slawsen.

27:57.562 --> 27:59.223
Oh, my name's not Cole Slawsen.

27:59.865 --> 28:02.629
Oh...right.

28:02.868 --> 28:03.766
Like l said,

28:04.002 --> 28:06.470
-as long as she's female.
-Okay.

28:10.976 --> 28:15.072
Oh my god, it has whiskers.

28:15.447 --> 28:16.436
And no teeth.

28:16.681 --> 28:17.113
Oh, no.

28:17.349 --> 28:19.749
She has teeth.

28:19.985 --> 28:22.112
They're just not
the conventional shade.

28:22.520 --> 28:25.148
lt's fine. lt's fine.
's fine. Come on.

28:32.831 --> 28:34.321
Hello, ladies.

28:35.367 --> 28:38.928
Cole Slawsen,
this is Cristabel Abbott.

28:39.304 --> 28:40.430
Hello.

28:41.773 --> 28:45.265
And the lovely June Phigg.

28:45.777 --> 28:46.869
Nice to meet you.

28:47.112 --> 28:48.807
-lt speaks.
-She's a woman.

28:49.047 --> 28:51.413
l can't do this
My dingus will fall off.

28:51.650 --> 28:52.776
You were rolling down your
flesh files.

28:53.018 --> 28:53.950
l want to be released
from my contract.

28:54.185 --> 28:54.617
-ls it me?
-Sorry.

28:54.853 --> 28:56.980
l'll triple your offer, Cole.

28:57.222 --> 28:58.280
Fine.

28:58.523 --> 29:01.788
We are too excited to do
this, girls.

29:03.261 --> 29:04.819
Woo.

29:09.801 --> 29:12.827
Now remember to stay focused,
okay?

29:13.071 --> 29:15.369
lf you start to panic,
practice your breathing exercises.

29:15.607 --> 29:17.302
And go into your tranquil haven.

29:21.413 --> 29:23.881
l am a mighty warrior,
fearless and strong.

29:24.115 --> 29:26.447
l admire your commitment
to excellence.

29:26.718 --> 29:28.447
Now, where's that driver guy?

29:28.687 --> 29:29.779
-Captain.
-Captain. Okay.

29:30.021 --> 29:31.648
l told him to be here by three.

29:31.890 --> 29:34.859
Ahoy! Sorry l'm late, folks.

29:35.093 --> 29:37.254
Just had to grab my keys
from the rental office.

29:37.495 --> 29:42.262
And l'm not feeling too well.

29:42.500 --> 29:44.832
You're going to have to find
yourself another skipper.

29:45.337 --> 29:46.827
Out of my way!

29:48.206 --> 29:51.039
-Oh, shucks.
-No, no, no.

29:51.443 --> 29:53.968
Breathe. Look at the beauty.

29:54.212 --> 29:55.804
Drink some of this.

29:58.049 --> 29:58.743
Okay.

29:59.117 --> 30:03.577
What we're going to do now is
what l like to call winging it.

30:03.822 --> 30:04.811
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:05.056 --> 30:06.455
We need you for the date.

30:09.461 --> 30:11.486
Now this is
what l'm talking about.

30:11.730 --> 30:14.198
Sun in my face, wind in my hair.

30:14.432 --> 30:16.491
The smell of salt in the air.

30:17.402 --> 30:19.029
lsn't this great?

30:20.505 --> 30:22.166
Magnificent.

30:23.308 --> 30:27.608
Okay...June,
how's your toe doing?

30:29.381 --> 30:30.871
lt's a lot better, thanks.

30:31.116 --> 30:32.674
This guy l work with at the zoo.

30:32.917 --> 30:33.975
He works with the gorillas.

30:34.219 --> 30:37.552
He actually mixed up a compound for
a silverback who had the same thing.

30:37.789 --> 30:40.849
Okay, anyone want another drink?

30:41.359 --> 30:42.587
Yes, yes.

30:42.827 --> 30:44.385
Absolutely.

30:48.867 --> 30:50.334
Are you okay?

30:51.403 --> 30:52.631
Never better.

30:52.871 --> 30:56.568
Cole has a little bit of
a problem with acid reflux.

30:56.808 --> 31:01.074
l also have irritable
bowel syndrome.

31:01.312 --> 31:04.907
And involuntary
explosive diarrhea, so...

31:05.717 --> 31:06.240
There it goes.

31:06.484 --> 31:07.416
l think l need to be excused.

31:07.652 --> 31:08.448
-You know what? You shouldn't go.
-Yeah, l should.

31:08.686 --> 31:09.345
You should probably stay around.

31:09.587 --> 31:11.077
-No, l shouldn't.
-There's not even a bathroom close.

31:11.322 --> 31:11.788
No, l can't do this.

31:12.023 --> 31:12.455
Look at her.

31:12.690 --> 31:13.247
No, no, no.

31:13.491 --> 31:14.287
You're not going to go.

31:14.526 --> 31:15.788
You're not going anywhere.

31:19.864 --> 31:20.796
You know what?

31:21.266 --> 31:22.290
Let's play a game.

31:22.534 --> 31:23.364
We're going to play a game.

31:23.601 --> 31:24.568
lt's gonna be fun.

31:25.970 --> 31:30.930
lf the two of you could go
anywhere in the world on a date

31:31.509 --> 31:33.477
Where would it be?

31:33.778 --> 31:34.369
Home.

31:34.612 --> 31:35.044
Okay

31:35.113 --> 31:35.875
You know... You know what?

31:35.947 --> 31:37.312
This is a question for me.

31:37.549 --> 31:38.982
Nate. l'll take this one.

31:39.551 --> 31:44.284
lf Nate could go anywhere in
the world on a date.

31:45.123 --> 31:49.025
His dream date would be...Venice.

31:49.961 --> 31:51.451
-Venice?
-Yeah.

31:51.696 --> 31:53.527
That would be my dream date too.

31:53.765 --> 31:54.857
Really?

31:55.166 --> 31:57.100
Anywhere in particular?

31:57.435 --> 31:59.266
No, nowhere really.

31:59.971 --> 32:02.667
l just heard it was a great place
to get lost in.

32:03.842 --> 32:08.006
Well, it's a gorgeous day out
and we're on this boat, so...

32:08.246 --> 32:09.270
Let's go get some sun.

32:09.514 --> 32:12.540
Let's do it...Cole Slawsen.

32:12.784 --> 32:14.183
Get our tan up.

32:54.759 --> 32:56.192
Breathe.

33:08.106 --> 33:09.835
l got this.

33:12.477 --> 33:14.172
l'm a mighty warrior.

33:15.180 --> 33:16.909
Fearless and strong.

33:17.916 --> 33:19.713
Come stop me.

33:21.352 --> 33:22.512
Nate, good news.

33:22.754 --> 33:24.346
l just my toenail.

33:44.642 --> 33:46.109
You know, he's just cooling off.

33:46.344 --> 33:48.278
The Coast Guard will
pick him up eventually.

34:05.296 --> 34:06.991
This should cheer us up.

34:07.332 --> 34:08.128
Good idea.

34:08.366 --> 34:09.628
More alcohol.

34:09.867 --> 34:11.266
That'll help.

34:13.338 --> 34:17.172
Oh...dropped it.

34:17.708 --> 34:19.472
Completely forgot l had this.

34:19.911 --> 34:23.641
They were giving these out to all
the personal trainers in town.

34:23.880 --> 34:25.473
Some sort of a promotion.

34:25.717 --> 34:26.478
What is it?

34:26.717 --> 34:30.745
Gift certificate to a chi-chi
Beverly Hills spa.

34:31.089 --> 34:31.646
Ha. Look at that.

34:31.889 --> 34:32.981
lt's for two people.

34:33.224 --> 34:33.849
You know what?

34:34.092 --> 34:35.286
The two of you
should really have this.

34:35.525 --> 34:37.221
l mean,
l'm never going to use it.

34:38.463 --> 34:41.830
Nate, this is for $2,000 worth
of spa treatments.

34:42.333 --> 34:43.891
You don't say.

34:44.534 --> 34:46.366
No, you and Cris should
go together.

34:46.670 --> 34:48.434
l don't do well
with spa treatments

34:48.672 --> 34:51.266
They tend to backfire.

34:51.509 --> 34:53.875
That Cole was an idiot.

34:54.112 --> 34:56.603
l saw plenty of other guys
checking you out.

34:57.515 --> 34:59.483
Stop it, Cris. Come on.

35:00.351 --> 35:02.148
We both know the only
male attention l get...

35:02.387 --> 35:04.855
...is when they crawl
over me to get to you.

35:05.089 --> 35:07.990
What about that guy who gave
you his card at the mall last week?

35:08.226 --> 35:09.716
He was a dermatologist.

35:09.961 --> 35:12.953
Well, he did offer to remove
your mole for free.

35:13.197 --> 35:13.686
That's cool

35:13.931 --> 35:15.626
He could have been flirting.

35:16.801 --> 35:20.532
l heard somewhere that 95 percent
of the way others see you

35:20.772 --> 35:22.672
is the way you see yourself.

35:23.341 --> 35:25.673
Stop being
so self conscious around guys.

35:26.044 --> 35:27.204
What am l supposed to do?

35:27.445 --> 35:28.912
Pretend they're all blind?

35:29.147 --> 35:33.140
l'm just saying you could try to
be more alluring and subtle.

35:33.551 --> 35:35.314
Men like a little mystery.

35:36.754 --> 35:39.314
Absolutely we do. Yes.

35:39.624 --> 35:43.856
Unraveling the fairer sex is
one of life's greatest riddles.

35:44.095 --> 35:47.656
Oh yeah. l'm the mysterious
type all right.

35:48.733 --> 35:52.396
Nothing says subtle like an
infected toenail in your Chapstick.

35:52.637 --> 35:54.366
June, don't be
so hard on yourself

35:54.605 --> 35:55.572
You know what?

35:55.907 --> 35:56.601
lt's fine.

35:56.841 --> 35:57.830
lt's fine.

35:58.376 --> 35:59.900
l know my place in life.

36:00.578 --> 36:02.671
l allow your many suitors
to do their...

36:02.914 --> 36:05.974
l'm a nice guy so l'm
talking to your ugly friend...

36:06.217 --> 36:07.411
in the hopes that
l might get a glimpse

36:07.652 --> 36:08.880
of your perfect breasts routine.

36:09.120 --> 36:10.485
Right, Nate?

36:13.391 --> 36:14.983
She's a little drunk.

36:15.226 --> 36:20.163
You know, June, some people think
our bodies are like an Earth suit

36:20.398 --> 36:22.389
A vessel that carries our soul

36:22.633 --> 36:26.364
until you pass on from this
planet into the next dimension.

36:28.106 --> 36:30.006
l don't even know
what that means.

36:30.575 --> 36:32.440
Yeah, l'm sort of with
her on this one.

36:33.644 --> 36:35.635
l'm just trying to help, okay?

36:36.247 --> 36:36.770
Great.

36:37.014 --> 36:40.450
Well...thanks for the help.

36:46.257 --> 36:47.690
l'm such a bad friend.

36:47.925 --> 36:49.017
No, that's ridiculous.

36:49.260 --> 36:50.522
You were just trying to help.

36:50.762 --> 36:51.194
Come on.

36:51.429 --> 36:53.420
You're absolutely
wonderful to June.

36:53.664 --> 36:54.187
l'm not.

36:54.432 --> 36:55.592
l'm horrible.

36:56.634 --> 36:59.034
l really made a promise to be
there for her.

36:59.837 --> 37:02.431
You've been so sweet and

37:03.574 --> 37:05.769
l'm really becoming
attracted to you.

37:07.111 --> 37:08.408
You are?

37:08.646 --> 37:11.342
And poor June's in there
crying her eyes out.

37:11.582 --> 37:12.048
Oh, no, no, no.

37:12.283 --> 37:13.011
Don't worry about her.

37:13.251 --> 37:14.411
She's not crying.

37:14.652 --> 37:16.745
She's probably
passed out by now.

37:18.423 --> 37:20.186
l really like you, Nate.

37:20.425 --> 37:21.392
Yeah?

37:21.626 --> 37:23.787
And you're gonna
think l'm crazy, but...

37:24.228 --> 37:26.458
l've thought about you
sometimes over the years.

37:27.198 --> 37:27.892
Really?

37:28.132 --> 37:32.125
l even used to look at our old
class picture once in a while.

37:33.838 --> 37:36.102
lf someone were standing here
telling me that...

37:36.340 --> 37:39.070
l would think they were crazy.

37:39.310 --> 37:41.244
Or a pedophile.

37:43.481 --> 37:44.607
But none of that matters now...

37:44.849 --> 37:47.977
because l can't
just abandon June like that.

37:48.886 --> 37:52.151
Look, l have a confession to make.

37:52.657 --> 37:54.147
When you told me you
weren't dating

37:54.392 --> 37:56.053
till June had
someone in her life...

37:56.294 --> 37:58.762
l did see her as an obstacle.

38:00.565 --> 38:02.157
l lied about the spa promotion.

38:02.400 --> 38:02.957
l paid for it.

38:03.201 --> 38:05.169
To give June a stealth makeover.

38:05.603 --> 38:07.093
That's so sneaky.

38:07.338 --> 38:08.669
l know it's awful.

38:08.906 --> 38:11.898
But now l really do
wantto help her.

38:12.143 --> 38:13.508
And l think l can.

38:13.744 --> 38:15.177
But l need your help.

38:15.680 --> 38:16.908
You know what?

38:17.148 --> 38:18.547
l believe you.

38:18.783 --> 38:19.613
Good.

38:19.851 --> 38:21.148
Now stick with me.

38:21.385 --> 38:22.784
l got a plan.

38:30.795 --> 38:33.355
Are you guys sure this won't
have any residual effects?

38:33.598 --> 38:36.396
Define residual.

38:37.568 --> 38:38.057
Okay.

38:38.302 --> 38:39.633
What we're going to do here today

38:39.871 --> 38:42.533
is a combination of
aversion therapy

38:42.773 --> 38:46.641
and do it yourself hypnosis.

38:47.345 --> 38:49.905
Ma'am? Excuse me.

38:50.147 --> 38:52.945
Hi. Could l um...

39:02.026 --> 39:04.256
Are you insane?

39:04.529 --> 39:05.427
No. Uh...

39:09.534 --> 39:11.092
Okay.

39:13.004 --> 39:16.440
Mmm...isn't it creamy
and delicious?

39:16.674 --> 39:20.735
What a delightful reward for
your attraction to June.

39:23.381 --> 39:24.370
No, no.

39:24.615 --> 39:25.877
This is the good part.

39:27.118 --> 39:28.779
l don't think l can do this.

39:29.020 --> 39:29.952
No, no, no.

39:30.187 --> 39:33.054
Let's not dwell in the negative,
Cole Slawsen.

39:33.291 --> 39:36.727
Your Medieval Times
goblet is half full.

39:36.961 --> 39:37.985
Huh?

39:38.229 --> 39:41.426
Okay...get the pendant.

39:47.605 --> 39:51.234
Your eyes are getting very heavy.

39:51.709 --> 39:52.300
No.

39:53.544 --> 39:56.240
l am going to
count backwards from ten.

39:56.514 --> 39:59.415
And when l finish you will
only remain conscious

39:59.650 --> 40:02.551
to the sound of
my mellifluous voice.

40:02.853 --> 40:11.522
Ten, nine, eight, seven six.

40:11.762 --> 40:13.229
Five...

40:13.497 --> 40:18.491
Four, three, two...

40:21.739 --> 40:23.331
One.

40:29.513 --> 40:31.378
You will open your eyes.

40:31.616 --> 40:34.710
And listen very carefully.

40:35.286 --> 40:38.221
When you see this...

40:38.456 --> 40:43.587
what you actually will be
seeing is this.

40:44.161 --> 40:45.890
Hi, Space Lady.

40:48.566 --> 40:49.726
Good.

40:51.702 --> 40:53.567
When l count to four

40:53.804 --> 40:57.399
You will wake up refreshed,
but you will remember...

40:57.642 --> 40:59.507
nothing of what happened today.

40:59.744 --> 41:02.144
You will, however,
remember my instructions

41:02.380 --> 41:05.315
until which time you hear the phrase,

41:06.083 --> 41:08.176
"l love ...

41:12.356 --> 41:15.416
Midget ...mimes?

41:18.963 --> 41:21.932
l love midget mimes.

41:22.166 --> 41:22.860
Good.

41:23.100 --> 41:23.794
One...

41:24.035 --> 41:27.027
Two, three, four.

41:37.815 --> 41:44.550
Oh, resistance is futile.

41:52.697 --> 41:56.224
Wow, you guys look amazing.

41:56.467 --> 41:59.698
June's going back next week
to get her mole removed finally.

41:59.937 --> 42:02.201
Well, it looks like Cole and
l are going to have to take ...

42:02.440 --> 42:04.931
you two supermodels
out to celebrate.

42:24.495 --> 42:26.224
l can't believe l'm doing this.

42:26.664 --> 42:28.791
l haven't had fat
or dairy in years.

42:29.033 --> 42:31.228
Whatever you've been doing...

42:31.669 --> 42:34.661
it is working, you saucy minx.

42:34.905 --> 42:36.770
The spa said
June's skin needs fat.

42:37.007 --> 42:37.473
Yeah.

42:37.708 --> 42:38.834
They also gave me Rogaine
for women

42:39.076 --> 42:42.011
and prescriptions for my skin
and my toenail thing.

42:42.513 --> 42:45.277
l'm really sorry if my toenail
grossed you out, Cole.

42:45.516 --> 42:46.949
lt was really embarrassing.

42:47.184 --> 42:50.620
how could l ever be grossed out
by such a luscious,

42:50.955 --> 42:54.391
pouty lipped inter---gallactic
vixen such as yourself?

42:56.193 --> 42:58.320
Thank the gods you were
disconnected from the

42:58.562 --> 42:59.859
Borg Collective through
the neutralization of

43:00.097 --> 43:02.395
your upper spinal
column neurotransceiver.

43:04.401 --> 43:05.459
What?

43:05.836 --> 43:08.236
Cole is a Trekkie.

43:08.973 --> 43:09.905
lsn't that fun?

43:10.141 --> 43:13.338
So that is the highest
complement he can pay you.

43:13.577 --> 43:16.273
ln this galaxy or any other.

43:17.515 --> 43:19.210
Let's keep walking.

43:19.450 --> 43:21.179
A little separation is fine.

43:21.519 --> 43:24.488
You know, Cole, the pier is
June's favorite spot in L.A.

43:24.722 --> 43:27.589
Yeah, l like to come down here
late at night,

43:27.825 --> 43:29.793
when everybody's gone.

43:30.060 --> 43:32.290
That way none of the tourists
ask me to take their picture

43:32.530 --> 43:34.191
with them for five dollars.

43:35.633 --> 43:38.033
You are a fiery goddess
with a clever tongue...

43:38.269 --> 43:40.169
to match your stunning countenance.

43:40.471 --> 43:42.302
Oh, you've got a little...

43:43.140 --> 43:44.732
l'll get it.

43:50.014 --> 43:50.503
You know what?

43:50.748 --> 43:53.308
Let's leave these two little
lovebirds alone, huh.

43:53.551 --> 43:54.882
-l don't think that's the best idea.
-No, no, no.

43:55.119 --> 43:57.644
-No, seriously.
-They're cute together. Come on.

43:57.888 --> 43:58.411
He's just a little strange.

43:58.656 --> 44:00.783
We all are in some ways, you know.

44:08.599 --> 44:10.157
You've got to be kidding me.

44:10.401 --> 44:11.299
Oh, look, Daddy.

44:11.535 --> 44:14.265
l love midget mimes.

44:24.248 --> 44:26.216
They're called little people,
honey.

44:34.792 --> 44:37.761
Oh, l totally forgot to tell you

44:37.995 --> 44:40.520
that Cole had
a traumatic experience

44:40.764 --> 44:42.527
with a mime as a child.

44:43.234 --> 44:45.361
Oh, it was awful.

44:45.603 --> 44:49.369
lt was his 5th birthday party and
a mime came to perform and

44:49.673 --> 44:52.233
unfortunately he caught the mime

44:52.476 --> 44:54.808
performing personal services
for his mother

44:55.045 --> 44:57.741
But, hey, look, this is fun.

45:09.059 --> 45:10.686
This might be good.

45:36.587 --> 45:37.918
l'm not going to stand for this.

45:38.155 --> 45:39.383
Excuse me.

45:42.860 --> 45:44.327
Don't mind him.

45:44.695 --> 45:46.492
He's a sad little man.

45:51.835 --> 45:53.302
l'm Johann.

46:01.478 --> 46:03.378
Sorry there's no antipasto...

46:03.614 --> 46:05.411
This is all l could whip up.

46:06.850 --> 46:09.216
-Nice place.
-Thanks, buddy.

46:09.453 --> 46:11.318
lt's cold and a little windy.

46:11.555 --> 46:12.954
Here's to new friends.

46:14.224 --> 46:15.623
Cheers.

46:16.927 --> 46:17.825
Cherrios.

46:18.062 --> 46:20.462
God, this view is incredible.

46:20.698 --> 46:22.359
You can even see
the Pier from here.

46:22.700 --> 46:24.565
l like to go down there sometimes.

46:24.802 --> 46:26.201
Hang out with the crowds.

46:26.437 --> 46:27.870
People watch.

46:28.539 --> 46:30.734
lt could get a little lonely
when you're single.

46:39.183 --> 46:46.885
So...Johann...are you
are you originally from L.A.?

46:47.124 --> 46:48.989
No, l grew up in Europe.

46:49.226 --> 46:50.454
My parents run
a little mountaineering

46:50.694 --> 46:52.355
school in the Swiss Alps.

46:52.596 --> 46:54.757
l moved here when l was
seventeen for college.

46:54.999 --> 46:57.866
Where did you go to college?

46:58.202 --> 46:59.499
Harvard.

47:00.337 --> 47:02.237
Oh...Right.

47:02.473 --> 47:04.600
Oh, it's really not
that impressive.

47:04.842 --> 47:07.140
My parents didn't have to spend
all that lvy League money...

47:07.378 --> 47:09.312
for me just to become a dentist.

47:09.546 --> 47:10.604
You're a dentist?

47:10.848 --> 47:12.941
Yeah, l love it.

47:13.183 --> 47:15.447
lt's so fulfilling.

47:15.686 --> 47:19.816
Of course, l did take a few years
off for the Marines.

47:21.492 --> 47:22.925
Let me get this straight.

47:23.160 --> 47:25.287
You went to Harvard
became a Marine

47:25.529 --> 47:27.463
and now you're a dentist?

47:27.765 --> 47:30.598
Yeah, l also did
a little modeling on the side

47:30.834 --> 47:33.962
just so my folks wouldn't have
to swing dental school.

47:34.238 --> 47:37.401
l still do it every now and
then just for a kick.

47:37.775 --> 47:39.743
Oh my god, l've seen you.

47:40.110 --> 47:42.374
Were you on the cover of
July's Men's Abs?

47:42.613 --> 47:44.308
Yeah. l didn't see it.

47:44.548 --> 47:47.210
l was in Central Asia
over the summer...

47:47.451 --> 47:49.146
doing Doctors Without Borders.

47:50.421 --> 47:52.286
My group's done some
fund raisers with them.

47:52.523 --> 47:54.753
They really do
the most amazing work.

47:54.992 --> 47:58.120
lt's the most rewarding
thing l've ever done.

48:01.331 --> 48:03.492
Have you ever done any modeling?

48:04.168 --> 48:07.535
You have unbelievable
bone structure.

48:09.373 --> 48:11.273
Look at! Oh, look at that.

48:11.508 --> 48:12.497
There's the bread.

48:12.743 --> 48:14.370
lt was hiding from me.

48:15.412 --> 48:17.175
This is so weird.

48:17.448 --> 48:22.078
You and Nate have
so much in common.

48:22.319 --> 48:23.547
We do?

48:23.787 --> 48:25.049
We do?

48:25.355 --> 48:26.652
How's that?

48:27.124 --> 48:31.288
Well...you're both really
into physical fitness.

48:32.496 --> 48:34.987
And Nate, here,
is a personal trainer.

48:36.400 --> 48:37.890
A personal trainer?

48:38.936 --> 48:40.563
Like at a gym?

48:44.007 --> 48:46.032
He's more of a lifestyle coach.

48:46.276 --> 48:47.334
Right, Nate?

48:47.578 --> 48:50.672
-Yeah.
-Exercise, diet, the whole nine yards.

48:50.914 --> 48:51.380
That's it.

48:51.615 --> 48:53.014
All nine of them.

48:53.884 --> 48:57.376
June, if you don't mind me
saying so, you have...

48:57.621 --> 49:02.320
the most intriguing case of
fluorosis l've ever seen.

49:05.496 --> 49:07.327
Please excuse my rudeness.

49:07.564 --> 49:09.429
l just always notice teeth.

49:09.900 --> 49:12.334
You never thought about
getting them fixed?

49:12.669 --> 49:14.796
Well, l thought about it...

49:15.038 --> 49:19.168
but my insurance doesn't
cover any cosmetic stuff, so

49:19.943 --> 49:21.968
l bet you never had a cavity.

49:22.679 --> 49:23.202
That's true.

49:23.447 --> 49:24.744
l never have.

49:24.982 --> 49:26.472
You are so lucky.

49:26.717 --> 49:30.244
Most of my patients would love
to trade places with you.

49:39.863 --> 49:41.854
You are so screwed.

49:42.099 --> 49:42.793
l am?

49:43.033 --> 49:46.161
He's just buttering up the
freak to get to Cristabel.

49:47.504 --> 49:49.597
This is your competition, my man.

49:49.840 --> 49:51.068
Where the hell did you get that?

49:51.308 --> 49:52.741
Mom saves old issues.

49:52.976 --> 49:56.036
l'll put it back on her bed
before she realizes it's gone.

49:56.547 --> 49:58.174
l'm not sure
he's after Cristabel.

49:58.415 --> 50:00.349
l actually think he likes June.

50:00.584 --> 50:03.348
Well has he ever technically
asked June out on a date?

50:03.587 --> 50:05.487
Well, not really.

50:05.722 --> 50:09.351
Any one on one action whatsoever?

50:09.593 --> 50:11.151
He offered to fix her teeth.

50:11.595 --> 50:14.120
Then he hasn't closed
the door to dating Cristabel.

50:14.364 --> 50:17.856
He's just doing a favor for her
hideously deformed friend.

50:20.137 --> 50:22.196
You're going through
the front door.

50:22.739 --> 50:24.798
He's going through
the back door.

50:25.042 --> 50:28.341
He's a back door man! lt's a
time honored technique.

50:28.579 --> 50:31.673
No. But what if Cristabel
doesn't have a back door?

50:31.915 --> 50:33.007
Or what if it's locked,

50:33.250 --> 50:35.184
and everybody just
goes through the front door?

50:35.419 --> 50:38.081
Oh, l'm not interested in you.

50:38.322 --> 50:39.949
l just want to be friends.

50:40.257 --> 50:46.218
Oh, oh, excuse me is that
my penis hitting your cervix?

50:48.432 --> 50:50.059
What am l going to do?

50:50.334 --> 50:53.269
Easy. You shadow him.

50:53.737 --> 50:54.829
Shadow him?

50:55.072 --> 50:56.869
Yeah, just make sure they're
never alone together

50:57.174 --> 51:00.234
where he can impress her without
you being there to deflect it.

51:00.477 --> 51:01.876
What you can't do,

51:02.112 --> 51:04.603
is let him show you up
in any way, okay?

51:04.848 --> 51:07.408
lf he ever tries to take off his
shirt in front of her...

51:07.651 --> 51:10.779
you got to make sure it only
happens over your dead puny body

51:11.021 --> 51:12.648
Shirt stays on. Got it.

51:12.889 --> 51:16.484
And secondly if his shirt ever
does come off in front of her,

51:16.727 --> 51:17.591
poke out her eyes.

51:17.828 --> 51:19.090
Eyes poked out.

51:19.496 --> 51:22.021
Thirdly, lie.

51:22.266 --> 51:22.994
Lie?

51:23.233 --> 51:23.665
Oh, come on.

51:23.900 --> 51:25.629
l thought that the most
important rule in relationships

51:25.869 --> 51:27.268
was to be honest.

51:27.504 --> 51:28.471
l'm sorry.

51:28.705 --> 51:32.038
Are you a former Marine
that graduated from Harvard

51:32.276 --> 51:34.244
and fixes needy
children's teeth?

51:35.045 --> 51:36.808
l got two words for you, my man.

51:37.214 --> 51:38.681
Lie.

51:53.330 --> 51:57.198
The perfect people have left the
genetically inferior ones to die.

51:58.035 --> 51:59.593
Save yourself, Nate.

52:00.003 --> 52:03.268
No, l'm not letting you go.

52:04.641 --> 52:06.233
Not on my watch.

52:06.977 --> 52:08.001
Stop!

52:08.245 --> 52:09.405
Stop, please.

52:09.646 --> 52:11.443
This is awful.

52:11.682 --> 52:13.081
God, you're telling me?

52:13.317 --> 52:14.944
l'm not even
supposed to be in the sun.

52:15.185 --> 52:16.880
l had my skin lasered last week.

52:17.120 --> 52:18.109
Really?

52:18.355 --> 52:20.721
Oh, yeah, l'm nubby.

52:21.892 --> 52:24.122
Johann is making
the veneers next week.

52:24.594 --> 52:27.586
l had to shave down her teeth
in order to take the impression.

52:27.931 --> 52:31.298
She's going to
look like Farrah in '79.

52:31.601 --> 52:33.796
Can you believe
how generous that it?

52:34.037 --> 52:35.197
Super generous.

52:35.439 --> 52:38.067
And clearly
with no ulterior motive.

52:38.308 --> 52:40.572
The truth is,
there is an ulterior motive.

52:40.811 --> 52:43.746
l can show the before and
after pictures to new patients.

52:43.980 --> 52:45.106
That's perfect.

52:45.349 --> 52:49.911
Just gives me more motivation to
enhance June's natural radiance.

52:57.894 --> 52:59.987
Speaking of natural beauty...

53:01.765 --> 53:02.959
Let's go.

53:04.301 --> 53:05.359
Come, guys

53:05.602 --> 53:06.899
Am l bleeding?

53:07.838 --> 53:09.703
Only on the inside.

53:16.346 --> 53:17.608
Cessna.

53:17.848 --> 53:19.440
That's a beaut.

53:21.318 --> 53:23.684
-Where?
-Right up there.

53:25.422 --> 53:26.889
Johann's a pilot.

53:27.190 --> 53:28.748
Of course he is.

53:29.159 --> 53:30.456
Do you fly, Nate?

53:30.694 --> 53:31.718
Yeah. Yeah.

53:31.962 --> 53:32.986
l fly planes.

53:33.230 --> 53:34.697
That's what l do.

53:34.931 --> 53:36.159
You fly?

53:36.867 --> 53:37.356
Yeah.

53:37.601 --> 53:41.093
l mean, to and fro... by and by.

53:41.405 --> 53:47.674
l like to do flips and uh
the tubelyoos and whatnot.

53:47.911 --> 53:49.071
You're a stunt pilot?

53:49.312 --> 53:52.804
Yeah...uh...not professionally, no.

53:53.049 --> 53:58.009
l like to take the kids up
every once in a while.

53:58.255 --> 54:01.281
-The kids?
-Needy children from the ghetto.

54:01.725 --> 54:02.248
Yeah.

54:02.492 --> 54:04.687
Most of the time it's the
first time they've ever flown.

54:04.928 --> 54:09.126
Oh, god it's just...
to see their faces...

54:09.366 --> 54:13.200
when the G forces hit them.

54:13.437 --> 54:15.962
l just can't describe it,
you know.

54:16.206 --> 54:20.438
lt's the most rewarding thing
l've ever done.

54:20.677 --> 54:21.769
So let me get this straight.

54:22.012 --> 54:26.210
You're not a professional pilot,
yet you risk the lives of children

54:26.450 --> 54:29.010
by doing dangerous
stunts in mid air?

54:29.553 --> 54:32.044
Uh...yeah...yeah.

54:32.289 --> 54:34.223
ln my flying dream....

54:34.458 --> 54:35.482
that l have.

54:35.725 --> 54:37.852
Just a little game with the kids.

54:38.094 --> 54:39.925
Didn't l mention it was a dream?

54:40.163 --> 54:41.596
No, you didn't mention that.

54:41.832 --> 54:44.596
Oh, yeah. l could see
how you guys all..

54:44.835 --> 54:48.236
No. lt's-it's-it's
a great dream that l have

54:48.472 --> 54:50.064
Just me and the kids.

54:51.041 --> 54:54.010
Them riding on my back,
my wings out like an angel.

54:54.244 --> 55:01.480
Like a...male heterosexual
angel in the wind.

55:01.785 --> 55:04.754
-Are you done?
-Yeah. Yeah.

55:05.121 --> 55:06.554
Wow. Okay. Yeah.

55:06.790 --> 55:07.313
Flying dreams.

55:07.557 --> 55:10.048
l for one love flying dreams.

55:10.460 --> 55:11.586
How often do you have these

55:11.828 --> 55:15.264
heterosexual male angel
flying dreams, Nate?

55:15.499 --> 55:17.626
Oh, l don't know June,
what's normal.

55:18.268 --> 55:20.862
Once or twice a year.

55:21.137 --> 55:22.832
Oh my god, me too.

55:23.073 --> 55:24.472
And then there's
always that second

55:24.708 --> 55:27.802
when you first wake up and you
actually believe it happened.

55:28.078 --> 55:29.773
Do you guys ever get those?

55:30.480 --> 55:32.107
Every night.

55:34.050 --> 55:35.381
Every night?

55:36.620 --> 55:40.716
l saw on Oprah that flying dreams
symbolize fearlessness.

55:40.957 --> 55:43.118
You can accomplish anything.

55:43.793 --> 55:45.283
Makes sense.

55:45.695 --> 55:47.162
You must be extremely advanced

55:47.397 --> 55:48.557
ln the soul level.

55:48.798 --> 55:51.392
Even Oprah only has them
once in a while.

55:52.102 --> 55:55.162
l don't know about my soul,
but l'm extremely advanced

55:55.405 --> 55:57.566
in the body temperature level.

55:58.375 --> 56:02.573
As the expression goes,
l'm sweating like a racehorse.

56:02.913 --> 56:04.141
l believe the expression is:

56:04.381 --> 56:07.646
l have to piss like a racehorse.

56:11.321 --> 56:14.313
There was a scorpion on your back.

56:14.558 --> 56:16.549
There's no scorpions out here.

56:18.194 --> 56:20.219
Or it might have been a tick.

56:21.097 --> 56:23.395
Now he's a mountaineering
stunt pilot?

56:23.700 --> 56:24.189
Yeah.

56:24.434 --> 56:26.493
We gotta figure out something
you're really good at.

56:26.736 --> 56:29.068
Okay. Figure out
what l'm good at.

56:29.372 --> 56:30.202
l don't know.

56:30.440 --> 56:31.668
What am l good at?

56:32.275 --> 56:34.903
You used to be good at climbing
the rope in gym class.

56:35.145 --> 56:35.611
Okay.

56:35.845 --> 56:36.869
Good at climbing rope.

56:37.113 --> 56:39.138
But how am l going to work
that into the routine?

56:39.382 --> 56:40.349
l don't know.

56:40.617 --> 56:42.949
What did we used to do to
impress girls during recess?

56:43.186 --> 56:44.915
Oh yeah. Yeah.

56:45.155 --> 56:46.247
l could dance.

56:46.489 --> 56:48.719
Of course, l'll have to leave out
the part that l wet myself.

56:48.959 --> 56:50.859
-That's the best part.
-Okay.

56:51.127 --> 56:55.188
What else you got in your arsenal?
What about the kazoo?

56:55.432 --> 56:57.957
Remember, we used to rock
the kazoo at naptime.

56:59.069 --> 57:00.229
Wait a minute.

57:00.537 --> 57:02.437
l got the perfect thing.

57:03.340 --> 57:04.739
What's the perfect thing?

57:05.275 --> 57:06.503
Hello?

57:13.416 --> 57:16.852
These old coffee houses remind me
of the swinging Sixties.

57:17.220 --> 57:20.883
Hey, who wants to hear
some Cat Stevens?

57:21.925 --> 57:24.894
Ooh, what a unique piece.

57:25.195 --> 57:26.560
May l?

57:27.497 --> 57:29.260
Uh, yeah.

57:29.499 --> 57:30.932
Took a little damage.

57:31.167 --> 57:32.134
Recently.

57:32.369 --> 57:37.329
l'm sure we can make
this old lady sing yet.

57:53.023 --> 57:55.685
Some day...

57:56.259 --> 57:58.591
Some how...

57:59.663 --> 58:02.393
You'll find...

58:03.133 --> 58:09.299
You'll shine like the sun.

58:13.243 --> 58:16.371
Some day...

58:16.613 --> 58:22.210
Some how, you'll find...

58:22.452 --> 58:23.350
You'll find...

58:23.586 --> 58:25.611
What you've been...

58:25.855 --> 58:28.380
Looking for...

58:33.463 --> 58:37.331
Some day. Some...

58:37.567 --> 58:43.301
Times, it's nice to see them...

58:43.540 --> 58:49.410
...fireflies burning
the night away.

59:08.598 --> 59:09.826
More. More.

59:10.066 --> 59:11.499
Oh, it works.

59:23.480 --> 59:24.811
lt's loud in here, huh.

59:25.048 --> 59:25.571
Huh?

59:25.815 --> 59:28.340
-lt's loud in here.
-Yeah. Yeah.

59:28.585 --> 59:30.052
What's up with all the hats?

59:30.286 --> 59:32.982
Oh, the Rogaine's working.

59:33.556 --> 59:36.525
Yeah, it's just that weird
in between stage, so.

59:36.760 --> 59:37.192
Cool.

59:37.427 --> 59:40.863
Plus l'm trying to avoid being
attacked by any scorpion ticks.

59:41.397 --> 59:43.456
Heard they were pretty common
around these parts.

59:48.138 --> 59:49.730
This song is amazing.

59:50.473 --> 59:52.168
l love this song.

59:53.877 --> 59:54.707
Care to dance?

59:54.944 --> 59:56.969
Ooh. l'm going to sit this out.

59:57.213 --> 59:58.680
But yeah,
l'll hold that for you.

59:58.915 --> 01:00:03.215
Back in the playground days,
l used to charm the ladies.

01:00:06.055 --> 01:00:07.113
What's...

01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:08.618
He stole my mojo.

01:00:08.858 --> 01:00:09.381
Ooh, that was hard.

01:00:09.626 --> 01:00:11.184
Come on, l did the collar thing.

01:00:11.427 --> 01:00:13.224
l was telling her
l wanted to dance.

01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:14.588
What did l do wrong?

01:00:14.831 --> 01:00:16.731
What? We going to
let them show us up?

01:00:17.967 --> 01:00:19.264
Come on. Don't you like it.

01:00:19.502 --> 01:00:21.231
-Oh, yeah.
-lt's awesome.

01:00:21.471 --> 01:00:22.961
lt's better than
what's out there.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.473
l wish there was a prom
in the first grade...

01:00:25.708 --> 01:00:27.141
... "cause l would have rocked it.

01:00:27.377 --> 01:00:28.207
Stop it.

01:00:28.444 --> 01:00:30.844
Hey we can tango, too, mama.

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.308
Come on.

01:00:32.682 --> 01:00:34.309
Don't get dizzy now.

01:00:44.661 --> 01:00:45.559
Another round?

01:00:46.329 --> 01:00:47.091
Yes. Another round would be great.

01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:47.989
Let's do another round.

01:00:48.231 --> 01:00:49.698
Another round.

01:00:57.507 --> 01:00:58.940
Wow, look at this.

01:00:59.309 --> 01:01:02.437
Back in my country,
they call this Swissmania.

01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:04.906
Ooh, the hands.

01:01:20.697 --> 01:01:22.130
Oh, come on.

01:01:22.365 --> 01:01:23.297
Come on.

01:01:23.533 --> 01:01:25.626
One small scrap of dignity left.

01:01:27.370 --> 01:01:30.066
-No.
-Okay, that's your cue.

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:31.563
Excuse me.

01:01:31.808 --> 01:01:32.240
Step aside.

01:01:32.475 --> 01:01:34.500
Excuse me.

01:01:45.355 --> 01:01:47.983
l've known a lot of jealous men
in my life...

01:01:48.324 --> 01:01:49.313
But you take the cake.

01:01:49.559 --> 01:01:52.084
Well if Men's Abs in there would
just keep his damn clothes on.

01:01:52.328 --> 01:01:52.817
He was hot!

01:01:53.062 --> 01:01:54.086
Oh, he was hot.

01:01:54.330 --> 01:01:56.389
He was sweating like a racehorse.

01:01:56.633 --> 01:01:58.157
The man sweats urine.

01:01:59.035 --> 01:02:01.868
Look just admit that he's hot.

01:02:02.105 --> 01:02:03.231
Johann is hot.

01:02:03.473 --> 01:02:05.338
Oh, so you're
attracted to Johann now.

01:02:05.575 --> 01:02:06.098
ls that it?

01:02:06.342 --> 01:02:07.536
No, l'm not.

01:02:07.777 --> 01:02:08.641
But you are.

01:02:08.878 --> 01:02:10.038
And why wouldn't you be?

01:02:10.280 --> 01:02:12.544
He's some kind of
a damned pod person.

01:02:12.982 --> 01:02:14.279
l don't blame you, okay.

01:02:14.517 --> 01:02:16.246
He's perfect.

01:02:16.486 --> 01:02:18.181
He's the male version of you.

01:02:18.421 --> 01:02:20.286
Oh, so now l'm a pod person.

01:02:20.523 --> 01:02:21.387
No.

01:02:21.624 --> 01:02:22.921
You're just.

01:02:24.527 --> 01:02:26.290
l mean, look at you.

01:02:26.829 --> 01:02:28.353
You're out of my league.

01:02:28.598 --> 01:02:30.122
You're in Johann's league...

01:02:30.366 --> 01:02:33.426
And l can't compete with that.

01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:35.467
You didn't have to compete.

01:02:36.072 --> 01:02:37.630
l was with you.

01:02:38.775 --> 01:02:40.709
l really liked you, Nate.

01:02:41.678 --> 01:02:43.407
l thought you were different.

01:02:43.646 --> 01:02:45.807
That you actually
wanted to help June.

01:02:46.149 --> 01:02:48.014
And that you wanted to
get to know me.

01:02:48.251 --> 01:02:49.650
l did want to help June.

01:02:49.886 --> 01:02:50.944
And you know what?

01:02:51.254 --> 01:02:53.017
l am out of your league.

01:02:53.256 --> 01:02:54.188
You can't sing.

01:02:54.424 --> 01:02:55.448
You can't dance.

01:02:55.692 --> 01:02:57.284
You're a terrible athlete.

01:02:57.527 --> 01:03:00.018
And a really crappy liar.

01:03:02.332 --> 01:03:04.266
l took the time to
get to know you, Nate.

01:03:05.335 --> 01:03:07.565
l really wish you did
the same with me.

01:03:07.804 --> 01:03:08.930
Cris, Cris.

01:03:09.172 --> 01:03:10.332
Hold on.

01:03:10.573 --> 01:03:12.370
Look, l made mistakes.

01:03:12.608 --> 01:03:13.575
l lied.

01:03:13.810 --> 01:03:15.334
l'm not perfect.

01:03:16.179 --> 01:03:19.046
But...it's still me.

01:03:19.282 --> 01:03:19.748
You know?

01:03:19.983 --> 01:03:21.245
Nate Cooper.

01:03:21.517 --> 01:03:23.075
l'm sorry, Nate.

01:03:23.886 --> 01:03:25.444
lt's over.

01:03:31.961 --> 01:03:33.019
Oh, come on.

01:03:33.262 --> 01:03:34.695
Here's your car, Loser.

01:03:35.832 --> 01:03:37.766
When you just
can't hide your abs,

01:03:38.001 --> 01:03:39.400
and that's why
everyone is looking for

01:03:39.635 --> 01:03:42.968
a product that gives them the
most effective workout possible.

01:03:43.206 --> 01:03:46.698
You see exercise should be
safe effective and fun.

01:03:46.943 --> 01:03:48.706
And, of course get you results.

01:03:48.945 --> 01:03:51.505
Time is one thing we all wish
we had more of.

01:03:52.448 --> 01:03:53.574
Look at you.

01:03:54.550 --> 01:03:57.280
You sad, sad man.

01:03:58.788 --> 01:04:00.915
Well, l'm crashing
your pity party.

01:04:01.324 --> 01:04:03.554
Oh, yeah,
it may be too late for me.

01:04:04.627 --> 01:04:06.561
But there's still hope for you.

01:04:10.533 --> 01:04:11.898
You dick!

01:04:12.135 --> 01:04:13.227
l can hear you.

01:04:13.469 --> 01:04:14.834
You're a foot away from me.

01:04:15.071 --> 01:04:15.503
Look, okay.

01:04:15.738 --> 01:04:16.602
There's going to be
a whole world of "ow' ...

01:04:16.839 --> 01:04:19.000
... waiting for you if
you give up now, Nate.

01:04:19.308 --> 01:04:21.640
lt's like what a wise
old lady once said.

01:04:22.245 --> 01:04:26.375
lf you give up on your dream,
you die.

01:04:27.350 --> 01:04:28.874
Are you quoting me Flashdance?

01:04:29.118 --> 01:04:31.678
There's only one person
that can help you now.

01:04:32.522 --> 01:04:35.013
She'll meet you
at Danny's Beachside Cafe

01:04:35.258 --> 01:04:37.192
at five o'clock.

01:04:37.693 --> 01:04:39.524
Five o'clock.

01:04:55.478 --> 01:04:56.740
Hey.

01:04:58.448 --> 01:04:59.540
June?

01:04:59.782 --> 01:05:01.807
Yeah, that's what
they usually call me.

01:05:02.051 --> 01:05:03.109
Your teeth.

01:05:03.352 --> 01:05:04.046
Oh yeah.

01:05:04.287 --> 01:05:05.515
Johann did the veneers yesterday.

01:05:05.755 --> 01:05:06.847
What do you think?

01:05:07.623 --> 01:05:11.821
Wow. You look so...normal.

01:05:12.061 --> 01:05:14.529
Oh, l bet you say
that to all the girls.

01:05:14.764 --> 01:05:17.597
Oh, my god. l'm sorry.

01:05:17.967 --> 01:05:21.232
More evidence of my staggering
lack of insight into women.

01:05:22.305 --> 01:05:24.239
No apology necessary.

01:05:24.474 --> 01:05:25.338
l mean, come on

01:05:25.575 --> 01:05:27.668
l think l look
a hell of a lot better.

01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:29.172
Yeah l'd have to agree.

01:05:29.412 --> 01:05:30.845
Wow, you look great.

01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:31.569
Thanks.

01:05:31.814 --> 01:05:35.375
Oh on my way over here
l'm not certain,

01:05:35.618 --> 01:05:36.880
but l think l was cat called.

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:37.643
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:05:37.987 --> 01:05:41.252
l mean, l know that for most women
that's a hideous daily occurrence,

01:05:41.491 --> 01:05:45.427
but when the guy with the rattail
and the mullet did this thing...

01:05:45.661 --> 01:05:46.252
where he put his hands like...

01:05:46.496 --> 01:05:47.155
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah...

01:05:47.396 --> 01:05:48.260
l know it.

01:05:48.498 --> 01:05:49.089
Okay, well anyway...

01:05:49.332 --> 01:05:50.959
l looked all around...

01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:53.668
and l realized l was
the only woman in sight.

01:05:53.903 --> 01:05:55.461
l mean, he was talking to me!

01:05:56.305 --> 01:05:58.603
l was so excited,
l almost went over and hugged him.

01:05:58.841 --> 01:06:00.001
l swear to God.

01:06:00.243 --> 01:06:01.175
You didn't, though, did you?

01:06:01.410 --> 01:06:01.842
Please.

01:06:02.078 --> 01:06:03.272
Even l have my standards.

01:06:03.513 --> 01:06:05.242
l don't know, though,
he could have been the one.

01:06:05.481 --> 01:06:07.813
So many rattails, no little time.

01:06:10.653 --> 01:06:12.951
lt's like a shock to the system.

01:06:13.189 --> 01:06:14.554
You have a whole new look.

01:06:14.790 --> 01:06:15.950
Don't start.

01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:20.520
Well, to be quite honest with you,
it's not exactly all mine.

01:06:20.763 --> 01:06:22.424
l borrowed the top from Cristabel.

01:06:23.332 --> 01:06:24.196
l thought there was
something about it...

01:06:24.433 --> 01:06:26.162
... that made me
want to shoot myself.

01:06:26.402 --> 01:06:27.630
Poor Nate.

01:06:27.870 --> 01:06:28.802
Oh.

01:06:32.341 --> 01:06:33.433
What?

01:06:36.212 --> 01:06:37.736
Do l have a booger in my nose?

01:06:38.681 --> 01:06:41.411
No...just...

01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:46.087
l'm happy for you.

01:06:46.422 --> 01:06:47.753
l'm happy for me, too.

01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.456
Good.

01:06:48.691 --> 01:06:49.089
l'm glad we agree on something.

01:06:49.325 --> 01:06:50.451
Finally.

01:06:51.661 --> 01:06:52.252
Hey, Randy.

01:06:52.495 --> 01:06:53.257
Hey, Stan.

01:06:53.496 --> 01:06:55.487
-Hey, Nate.
-Hi, Nate.

01:07:06.442 --> 01:07:07.238
Here, l want you to try

01:07:07.476 --> 01:07:09.376
-some of mine.
-Okay.

01:07:09.612 --> 01:07:10.738
Just try it.

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:11.605
ls it better?

01:07:11.847 --> 01:07:13.212
"Cause l think l got
the better one.

01:07:13.449 --> 01:07:14.438
No, l got the better one.

01:07:14.684 --> 01:07:15.708
You gave yourself the better one?

01:07:15.952 --> 01:07:16.577
- Yeah.
- That's so unfair.

01:07:16.819 --> 01:07:17.786
l'm the guest.

01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:19.954
You didn't know and
l'm selfish, so.

01:07:20.189 --> 01:07:20.746
That's a good point.

01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:22.184
l wouldn't have known.

01:07:23.159 --> 01:07:25.992
So, how's Johann?

01:07:26.229 --> 01:07:29.289
Good... l don't know.

01:07:30.466 --> 01:07:31.933
That was a steady decline.

01:07:33.502 --> 01:07:35.265
Well, he hasn't
made a move yet, so...

01:07:35.504 --> 01:07:38.632
l can't really tell
whether he likes me or not.

01:07:39.342 --> 01:07:41.674
Anyway, what's to like, right?

01:07:41.911 --> 01:07:43.344
What's to like?

01:07:43.779 --> 01:07:45.770
Oh, come on,
what does that mean?

01:07:46.015 --> 01:07:47.607
There's plenty to like.

01:07:47.950 --> 01:07:48.644
Such as?

01:07:48.884 --> 01:07:53.514
You can really hold your liquor.

01:07:55.124 --> 01:07:57.490
Sarcasm will get you everywhere.

01:08:02.164 --> 01:08:03.961
Let me ask you a question.

01:08:08.771 --> 01:08:10.636
ls this pointless?

01:08:14.610 --> 01:08:18.011
Am l ever going to have
another chance with Cristabel?

01:08:21.951 --> 01:08:27.912
Oh...yeah. Of course you will.

01:08:28.157 --> 01:08:30.921
Because um...because l'm...

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:34.287
l'm going to tell her
to give you another chance.

01:08:35.531 --> 01:08:38.055
Our annual costume party
is a week from tonight...

01:08:38.301 --> 01:08:40.895
...so you'll both be there.

01:08:41.304 --> 01:08:42.737
Well, that's great.

01:08:42.971 --> 01:08:43.631
Yeah.

01:08:43.872 --> 01:08:49.334
And you're going to
be yourself for once.

01:08:49.578 --> 01:08:51.408
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Please.

01:08:51.647 --> 01:08:54.377
Listen, we've built this
friendship around trust.

01:08:54.617 --> 01:08:55.675
l think we need to keep it there.

01:08:55.917 --> 01:08:56.645
-All right.
-Okay.

01:08:56.886 --> 01:08:58.649
Well, if we're both being
so honest...

01:08:58.888 --> 01:08:59.319
Yeah.

01:08:59.555 --> 01:09:00.852
Why don't you bring
your crappy car ...

01:09:01.090 --> 01:09:02.955
and that guitar you clearly
don't know how to play.

01:09:03.192 --> 01:09:03.624
Okay.

01:09:03.859 --> 01:09:06.089
As long as you bring
that foxy yoga outfit...

01:09:06.328 --> 01:09:08.091
with the granny panties
l love so much.

01:09:08.331 --> 01:09:09.992
Don't make fun

01:09:11.434 --> 01:09:13.698
God. l mean, who really
wants to go to a party...

01:09:13.935 --> 01:09:15.836
... as the girl who's
never been kissed anyway.

01:09:16.072 --> 01:09:18.506
What? No, that's not true.

01:09:18.741 --> 01:09:21.868
l totally planted one on you
at the yoga place.

01:09:22.111 --> 01:09:23.578
Are you out of your mind?

01:09:23.813 --> 01:09:24.541
No, l'm not out of my mind.

01:09:24.779 --> 01:09:25.371
That was not a kiss.

01:09:25.613 --> 01:09:27.411
That was you falling into me.

01:09:27.649 --> 01:09:28.082
That's what l did.

01:09:28.317 --> 01:09:29.944
l got the---Okay, fine.

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:40.554
Oh...well...

01:09:44.367 --> 01:09:46.426
l'm sorry. l, uh...

01:09:47.403 --> 01:09:49.428
l don't know why l did that.

01:09:52.174 --> 01:09:54.904
You don't know
why you did that.

01:09:56.979 --> 01:09:59.641
-No.
-Right.

01:10:00.049 --> 01:10:01.846
-June.
-l think you should just go, Nate.

01:10:02.084 --> 01:10:04.644
June, listen,
l'm trying to figure---

01:10:05.654 --> 01:10:07.053
Get out of here.

01:10:07.289 --> 01:10:09.086
Before your girlfriend gets back.

01:10:42.024 --> 01:10:43.116
Excuse me.

01:10:48.798 --> 01:10:49.787
Traffic's heavy today.

01:10:50.032 --> 01:10:50.623
Beep. Beep. Beep.

01:10:50.866 --> 01:10:52.595
You better have insurance.

01:11:09.051 --> 01:11:11.076
There's my girl.

01:11:16.792 --> 01:11:17.315
Come on.

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:18.891
l want to show you off
to my friends.

01:11:19.295 --> 01:11:20.091
Looking good, buddy.

01:11:20.329 --> 01:11:21.261
Looking good.

01:11:21.497 --> 01:11:22.930
Yeah, you too.

01:11:23.165 --> 01:11:24.996
Oh, by the way,
l talked to Cristabel ...

01:11:25.234 --> 01:11:27.759
and l smoothed everything over,
so she's really excited to see you.

01:11:28.003 --> 01:11:30.130
Although l should warn you,
she's a little bit, you know.

01:11:31.807 --> 01:11:34.503
Oh Coopie...

01:11:34.743 --> 01:11:35.869
What can l say?

01:11:36.111 --> 01:11:38.204
l've always wanted to be a bride.

01:11:39.114 --> 01:11:41.878
Every little girl's dream, right?

01:11:42.885 --> 01:11:43.909
Right.

01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:48.388
You don't have to say a thing.

01:11:49.291 --> 01:11:51.486
June told me what happened.

01:11:52.194 --> 01:11:54.424
-She did?
-Yep.

01:11:54.763 --> 01:11:57.789
You were just being protective
of my little Junie.

01:11:58.033 --> 01:12:00.399
Yes, right.

01:12:00.803 --> 01:12:03.533
l may have misjudged you,
Nate Cooper.

01:12:05.574 --> 01:12:06.802
Oops.

01:12:07.443 --> 01:12:08.375
Don't worry.

01:12:08.611 --> 01:12:10.078
lt wasn't a smelly one.

01:12:10.479 --> 01:12:12.845
l can tell by the way they sound.

01:12:13.082 --> 01:12:14.549
That's good.

01:12:19.488 --> 01:12:20.785
Shit!

01:12:21.023 --> 01:12:22.388
Sorry.

01:12:24.393 --> 01:12:25.360
...listen.

01:12:25.594 --> 01:12:28.688
l read somewhere about white
wine getting out red wine.

01:12:28.931 --> 01:12:29.522
Okay.

01:12:29.765 --> 01:12:32.165
l don't know if that---

01:12:32.434 --> 01:12:34.425
Oh, god.

01:12:34.670 --> 01:12:35.932
lt's not working!

01:12:36.338 --> 01:12:37.635
lt's not working!

01:12:37.873 --> 01:12:38.339
lt's not working!

01:12:38.574 --> 01:12:39.006
l have to go.

01:12:41.744 --> 01:12:44.804
You know, l think Grace Kelly
and l need a minute.

01:12:45.047 --> 01:12:46.514
-Come on.
-Bye.

01:13:10.139 --> 01:13:11.629
Oh hey there, little buddy.

01:13:12.107 --> 01:13:16.100
Just about to finish these pesto
gorgonzola torta rings.

01:13:16.345 --> 01:13:19.610
Why don't you have a taste
and let me know what you think.

01:13:26.155 --> 01:13:27.486
They're wonderful.

01:13:28.123 --> 01:13:28.987
Of course.

01:13:29.224 --> 01:13:30.316
Absolutely wonderful.

01:13:30.559 --> 01:13:31.821
You're wonderful.

01:13:32.061 --> 01:13:34.154
Everything you do is wonderful.

01:13:35.564 --> 01:13:37.498
l've never seen June happier.

01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:39.797
Thanks, pal.

01:13:40.669 --> 01:13:42.000
Don't mention it.

01:13:42.237 --> 01:13:45.798
lt was a lot of work, but once
l put my mind to something...

01:13:46.041 --> 01:13:47.633
l always get what l want.

01:13:48.744 --> 01:13:49.506
You know what?

01:13:49.745 --> 01:13:50.507
Fine.

01:13:50.746 --> 01:13:52.941
l'm happy for you guys, okay?

01:13:53.182 --> 01:13:53.773
l was wrong.

01:13:54.016 --> 01:13:56.610
You and June actually
make a great couple.

01:13:57.052 --> 01:13:59.987
l know. lsn't she amazing?

01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:02.614
Yeah.

01:14:03.058 --> 01:14:04.582
Yeah, she really is.

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:07.594
Now that she's
got some confidence in herself

01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:09.695
there are plenty of guys
who'd love to have her.

01:14:09.932 --> 01:14:11.729
New teeth, hair

01:14:12.701 --> 01:14:14.760
She's almost beautiful now.

01:14:16.839 --> 01:14:22.573
Women like June are just
so much more...grateful.

01:14:24.313 --> 01:14:26.406
Yeah, she worked hard.

01:14:26.982 --> 01:14:31.180
And l think tonight,
it's finally time for her reward.

01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:32.819
You know what l mean?

01:14:38.727 --> 01:14:39.887
What's wrong?

01:14:40.129 --> 01:14:41.858
Did l use too much basil?

01:14:55.277 --> 01:14:56.904
Nate, what are you doing?

01:14:59.948 --> 01:15:02.075
Deep breaths.

01:15:03.252 --> 01:15:04.810
One one-thousand...

01:15:05.087 --> 01:15:06.577
Two one thousand...

01:15:13.028 --> 01:15:13.858
All right, everyone.

01:15:14.096 --> 01:15:14.926
Party's over.

01:15:15.164 --> 01:15:16.631
Out.

01:15:23.338 --> 01:15:25.397
One grain of happiness.

01:15:25.841 --> 01:15:28.469
One grain of happiness
in my entire life.

01:15:28.711 --> 01:15:30.679
l understand you're upset.

01:15:30.913 --> 01:15:32.881
But Johann happens to be the devil!

01:15:33.115 --> 01:15:33.843
Shut up.

01:15:34.083 --> 01:15:34.981
The night of date five,

01:15:35.217 --> 01:15:37.708
when it's okay for
a consenting female adult

01:15:37.953 --> 01:15:40.353
to have sex without
being considered slutty...

01:15:40.589 --> 01:15:41.055
June.

01:15:41.290 --> 01:15:42.382
The night l was going t
become a non-virgin

01:15:42.624 --> 01:15:44.922
-and leave this freak fest behind.
-June. June, listen.

01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:46.457
Shut up!

01:15:48.997 --> 01:15:51.090
l helped you.

01:15:52.935 --> 01:15:53.993
l could have shot you down

01:15:54.236 --> 01:15:56.500
and Cristabel would never
have returned your calls.

01:15:56.739 --> 01:15:58.070
He doesn't love you.

01:16:00.809 --> 01:16:03.209
He said that you would be grateful.

01:16:03.512 --> 01:16:05.207
l am grateful!

01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:13.845
You don't get it, do you.

01:16:14.356 --> 01:16:15.721
l don't know.

01:16:16.225 --> 01:16:20.924
l've never even had a boyfriend.

01:16:21.497 --> 01:16:22.691
He doesn't get you.

01:16:22.931 --> 01:16:23.898
He doesn't deserve you.

01:16:24.133 --> 01:16:26.897
Oh and you think people get
what they deserve in life.

01:16:28.871 --> 01:16:31.032
You think they get
the fairy tale ending.

01:16:31.273 --> 01:16:31.830
l don't know.

01:16:32.074 --> 01:16:33.507
Maybe, yeah.

01:16:33.742 --> 01:16:36.142
You know, if they're
not willing to compromise.

01:16:36.378 --> 01:16:38.778
lf they're not willing
to settle for anything less.

01:16:44.253 --> 01:16:47.950
Well, knowing what you are is
also knowing what you're not.

01:16:51.393 --> 01:16:52.917
l'm not the girl ...

01:16:54.196 --> 01:16:56.096
...the guy runs to,

01:16:56.899 --> 01:16:59.561
to tell his feelings for,
all out of breath.

01:17:00.369 --> 01:17:01.461
Why couldn't you be?

01:17:01.703 --> 01:17:06.106
Because not everybody gets
that out of breath sort of moment.

01:17:07.309 --> 01:17:08.742
That's okay.

01:17:10.879 --> 01:17:11.971
Most of us are just happy...

01:17:12.214 --> 01:17:14.341
... to date a guy
who brushes his teeth.

01:17:18.353 --> 01:17:20.719
That's the thing
about fairy tales, Nate.

01:17:24.693 --> 01:17:26.285
They're just not true.

01:17:39.041 --> 01:17:41.805
Nate, she "s big girl.

01:17:42.044 --> 01:17:45.172
Yeah. l understand that.

01:17:46.381 --> 01:17:48.212
lt's sweet how protective
you've been...

01:17:48.450 --> 01:17:51.078
...but if June wants to be
withJohann tonight...

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:53.584
...then that's
her decision to make.

01:17:55.691 --> 01:17:58.455
Anyway, it's not like she agreed
to marry him or anything.

01:17:58.694 --> 01:18:00.787
lt's just one night.

01:18:01.964 --> 01:18:04.831
Well, somehow l don't take
comfort in that knowledge.

01:18:06.168 --> 01:18:07.863
Relax, Nate.

01:18:08.170 --> 01:18:09.603
You did it.

01:18:09.938 --> 01:18:11.929
You found someone for June.

01:18:13.275 --> 01:18:14.867
And a deal's a deal.

01:18:16.378 --> 01:18:18.573
Now that June gets
what she wants...

01:18:18.814 --> 01:18:20.475
...we can get what you want.

01:18:22.784 --> 01:18:24.809
Oops, l forgot.

01:18:26.021 --> 01:18:27.682
l have a confession to make.

01:18:29.091 --> 01:18:30.854
l was kind of testing you tonight.

01:18:32.694 --> 01:18:33.922
What do you mean?

01:18:34.162 --> 01:18:35.459
This tacky dress...

01:18:35.697 --> 01:18:38.564
acting drunk and anxious
to get married...

01:18:39.034 --> 01:18:41.298
and spilling
the wine all over my dress.

01:18:41.703 --> 01:18:43.261
lt was all an act.

01:18:44.339 --> 01:18:45.397
Why?

01:18:45.641 --> 01:18:47.836
Well, when you really
care about someone...

01:18:48.076 --> 01:18:50.271
...you're willing to
overlook their flaws.

01:18:50.946 --> 01:18:56.179
And l just wanted to make sure
that you liked me for me.

01:19:01.390 --> 01:19:02.914
Come with me.

01:19:03.158 --> 01:19:04.887
l got something to show you.

01:19:37.292 --> 01:19:41.922
Here's to
finding your perfect match.

01:19:54.142 --> 01:19:55.507
Pick one.

01:20:04.086 --> 01:20:06.554
You have excellent taste,
Mister Cooper.

01:20:06.788 --> 01:20:07.777
Thanks.

01:20:08.023 --> 01:20:10.389
So why don't you
go light some candles.

01:20:10.726 --> 01:20:13.160
June has some
in the dresser in her room.

01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:22.561
So was your father a baker
by any chance?

01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:27.334
No. Why?

01:20:27.676 --> 01:20:30.804
"Cause you've
got such great buns.

01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:47.455
l want to become a non-virgin.

01:21:27.202 --> 01:21:29.466
Don't make any sudden moves.

01:21:29.704 --> 01:21:32.400
She's trying to strangle herself
with her hood.

01:21:36.445 --> 01:21:39.141
l just wanted to give her this.

01:21:44.453 --> 01:21:47.854
Thanks....l guess.

01:22:21.490 --> 01:22:24.687
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

01:22:32.534 --> 01:22:33.865
Listen, l think...

01:22:34.102 --> 01:22:35.899
Oh...okay...

01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:42.307
Can you please
put your robe back on?

01:22:42.744 --> 01:22:43.642
Okay.

01:22:43.879 --> 01:22:46.905
lt's the first time anyone's
asked me to do that.

01:22:47.282 --> 01:22:48.544
l'm sure.

01:22:50.352 --> 01:22:52.946
l think that l just want to talk.

01:22:53.622 --> 01:22:55.351
Okay, sure.

01:22:57.526 --> 01:22:58.424
Nate...

01:22:58.660 --> 01:22:59.957
...you can turn around now.

01:23:00.195 --> 01:23:04.154
Right. Turning around.

01:23:11.907 --> 01:23:17.004
lt's just...why me?

01:23:17.312 --> 01:23:18.609
What do you mean?

01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:23.613
There are a million guys
who would kill to be

01:23:23.852 --> 01:23:26.685
sitting here with you right now.

01:23:27.189 --> 01:23:28.781
Why did you pick me?

01:23:29.024 --> 01:23:30.514
l didn't pick you.

01:23:30.859 --> 01:23:32.850
-You didn't?
-No.

01:23:33.428 --> 01:23:37.296
lt was fate. Magic. Serendipity.

01:23:37.532 --> 01:23:42.834
Right, and that's what l thought,
too, but why did you think so?

01:23:43.071 --> 01:23:46.268
Well, you know, after all these
years of not seeing each other...

01:23:46.508 --> 01:23:48.703
and then how we literally ran
into each other at the beach.

01:23:48.944 --> 01:23:51.242
Oh, about that.

01:23:51.947 --> 01:23:53.642
l tracked you down.

01:23:53.982 --> 01:23:57.042
and l found out you were
going to be at the beach that day.

01:23:57.285 --> 01:23:59.276
And l followed you.

01:24:00.655 --> 01:24:01.622
You stalked me.

01:24:01.856 --> 01:24:04.848
Stalked is a big word.

01:24:05.093 --> 01:24:08.119
Uh, listen...

01:24:09.297 --> 01:24:11.424
Ever since the first grade...

01:24:12.634 --> 01:24:16.764
l thought you were the girl
that l was meant to be with

01:24:17.639 --> 01:24:20.506
And now you think you
made a mistake?

01:24:20.742 --> 01:24:22.232
Let's put it this way.

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:28.641
l think l gave the valentine
to the right girl.

01:24:30.885 --> 01:24:33.046
Oh my god.

01:24:33.588 --> 01:24:35.647
You have to go tell her.

01:24:36.191 --> 01:24:37.886
Are you sure?

01:24:38.827 --> 01:24:39.987
Nate, l'll be fine.

01:24:40.228 --> 01:24:42.321
lt's not like l have trouble
getting dates.

01:24:43.665 --> 01:24:45.064
Yeah, you're probably right.

01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:47.996
Um...okay.

01:24:49.137 --> 01:24:49.694
Go.

01:24:49.938 --> 01:24:51.371
Okay.

01:24:53.408 --> 01:24:55.273
Way to go, June.

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:13.884
June?

01:25:27.442 --> 01:25:29.205
l'm so sorry.

01:26:13.688 --> 01:26:15.053
Don't say a word.

01:26:18.159 --> 01:26:21.686
l came here not to tell you
that Johann doesn't deserve you

01:26:21.930 --> 01:26:23.830
which you already
figured out for yourself.

01:26:24.065 --> 01:26:27.034
And not to tell you
that l am in love with you.

01:26:27.402 --> 01:26:28.869
Which l am.

01:26:29.204 --> 01:26:30.694
Desperately.

01:26:32.073 --> 01:26:32.801
My entire life,

01:26:33.041 --> 01:26:35.407
something has been holding me back
from falling in love.

01:26:35.643 --> 01:26:37.372
And l thought it was Cristabel.

01:26:37.612 --> 01:26:44.484
But l realized that l've just
been fumbling my way to you.

01:26:45.186 --> 01:26:47.416
My last girlfriend,
her name was Jane.

01:26:47.655 --> 01:26:49.589
That's one letter off.

01:26:49.858 --> 01:26:50.654
l don't even know
what that means.

01:26:50.892 --> 01:26:51.620
That's dumb.

01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:52.690
l'm sorry.

01:26:52.927 --> 01:26:53.951
Listen.

01:26:54.262 --> 01:26:56.127
l don't deserve you.

01:26:57.432 --> 01:27:01.926
Because l didn't take the time
to see who you were.

01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:10.639
And you have to know
that you're the girl.

01:27:11.679 --> 01:27:14.910
You're the girl that
the guy runs to.

01:27:17.185 --> 01:27:19.085
You're the girl.

01:27:21.222 --> 01:27:25.716
You're...you're out of breath.
