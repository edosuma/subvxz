01:24.793 --> 01:26.461

01:26.503 --> 01:29.381
Could that be one of those gemstone dolphins?

01:29.423 --> 01:31.592
I've never seen one of those!

01:31.633 --> 01:33.218
Boys, let's bring him in!

02:08.753 --> 02:11.048
You're a frisky one, aren't ya?

02:11.090 --> 02:12.716
Yeah, she's gonna pay a pretty penny

02:12.758 --> 02:14.051
for this one.

02:14.093 --> 02:15.260
Let's make a move!

02:42.537 --> 02:43.705
No...

02:43.747 --> 02:46.000
Emerald!

02:46.041 --> 02:48.669
Don't worry, I'll come after you.

02:48.710 --> 02:51.254
You guys stay here so they can't catch you.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.049
I'll find him.

03:05.769 --> 03:08.396
Whoa! Is this
whole place ours?

03:08.438 --> 03:09.606
Sure is.

03:09.648 --> 03:10.732
Not bad, huh?

03:10.774 --> 03:12.651
Not bad at all.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.277
It's even better than it looked online.

03:26.623 --> 03:29.417
Hey, look, there's even an upstairs.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.086
It's like a treehouse!

03:31.128 --> 03:32.379
So cool.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.882
Wow...

03:34.923 --> 03:36.925
If I'm dreaming, don't wake me up!

03:36.967 --> 03:38.593
Speaking of dreaming,

03:38.635 --> 03:42.514
I can't wait to sleep on these cozy beds.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.474
You can see the whole resort from here.

03:44.516 --> 03:45.517
It's awesome.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.354
Whoa...

03:49.396 --> 03:51.148
And there's even a slide!

03:52.149 --> 03:53.901
What? We have a slide!?

03:53.942 --> 03:56.236
Where's Mr. Floatie?
I'm going in.

03:58.279 --> 03:59.198
Hmm...

04:02.325 --> 04:03.577
Huh?

04:07.998 --> 04:08.999
Wow...

04:09.041 --> 04:11.835
These binoculars are super powerful.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.212
Thanks for getting them for me.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.629
No prob.

04:14.671 --> 04:17.298
It's the least I could do
for you and your foot.

04:17.339 --> 04:18.341
You see Ken yet?

04:18.382 --> 04:20.010
Uh...

04:20.052 --> 04:21.553
There he is!

04:21.595 --> 04:23.931
Aw, he caught a sweet wave!

04:23.972 --> 04:25.640
Must be nice.

04:26.892 --> 04:28.227
Do you know how disappointing it is

04:28.268 --> 04:30.145
to sprain your ankle
right before going on vacation

04:30.187 --> 04:33.065
to a beach that has
the best waves in the world?

04:33.107 --> 04:34.858
I know, it's beyond a bummer.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.401
I'm not saying we won't miss you,

04:36.443 --> 04:38.779
but I'm sure you can find
other cool stuff to do.

04:40.155 --> 04:42.282
Collect some shells, check out the birds,

04:42.323 --> 04:43.658
build sandcastles?

04:43.700 --> 04:44.910
Building sandcastles

04:44.952 --> 04:46.870
is not really an extreme sport.

04:46.912 --> 04:48.122
Besides...

04:48.163 --> 04:50.582
you've never gotten sand
inside a cast, have you?

04:50.624 --> 04:52.709
Not exactly comfortable.

04:52.751 --> 04:55.796
Nope.
You've got me there.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.798
At least you get the cast off tomorrow.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.175
I can keep you company till then!

05:00.217 --> 05:01.718
Thanks, Chels.

05:09.226 --> 05:10.894
Oh, check it out!

05:10.936 --> 05:12.312
Our own blender and fresh fruit.

05:12.353 --> 05:13.730
We can make smoothies.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.655
Easy does it, little guy.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.657
I'd love to trade places with you, Stace,

05:23.698 --> 05:27.577
'cause, frankly, I'd prefer to stay
inside and work on my photo blog.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.249
But how are you going to get

05:32.291 --> 05:33.875
that prize-winning
underwater shot

05:33.917 --> 05:35.919
if you don't actually go in the water?

05:35.961 --> 05:36.962
Good point.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.046
Hey!

05:38.088 --> 05:39.173
What do you think?

05:39.214 --> 05:40.048
All settled in?

05:41.508 --> 05:43.010
This place is amazing, Ken.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.846
You're so lucky to be doing

05:45.887 --> 05:47.764
your marine biology internship here.

05:47.806 --> 05:49.266
And we're super stoked to be here!

05:50.892 --> 05:53.436
I'm so glad you guys could come visit.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.563
Have you seen any mermaids yet?

05:55.605 --> 05:56.815
Mermaids?

05:56.857 --> 05:59.901
Chelsea, Ken's here studying real sea life.

05:59.943 --> 06:01.402
Mermaids live in the sea.

06:03.404 --> 06:05.657
Just because you've never seen them
doesn't mean they're not real, Skip.

06:05.699 --> 06:08.451
Well, have you seen any dolphins?

06:08.493 --> 06:10.204
Dolphins? No.

06:10.245 --> 06:12.706
I'm mostly studying starfish
and sea urchins.

06:12.747 --> 06:13.999
And by "studying,"

06:14.041 --> 06:16.417
he means
"cleaning their tanks."

06:16.459 --> 06:18.003
Yeah, you're right.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.963
But I've got another hour

06:20.005 --> 06:21.589
before I have to get back to work,

06:21.631 --> 06:23.342
so who wants to see the reef?

06:23.382 --> 06:24.218
Me!

06:24.259 --> 06:25.969
I wish.

06:26.011 --> 06:27.721
Skip, you're coming, aren't you?

06:27.762 --> 06:28.763
Hey!

06:28.805 --> 06:29.973
Stop it!

06:30.015 --> 06:32.100
Slobber attack!

06:32.142 --> 06:33.601
Good thing this is waterproof.

06:35.270 --> 06:37.772
Come on, Skip, let's go get ready.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.066
I'm coming, I'm coming.

06:39.107 --> 06:41.068
Whoops!
Almost forgot this.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.237
You gonna keep an eye on us, Stacie?

06:43.278 --> 06:45.030
Or are you gonna check out some cool birds?

06:45.072 --> 06:45.989
Nah.

06:46.031 --> 06:47.908
Bird-watching is for...

06:47.949 --> 06:49.076
the birds.

06:49.117 --> 06:52.579
People are much more interesting.

07:01.462 --> 07:03.382
We could just snorkel at the surface,

07:03.422 --> 07:04.966
but I'd recommend free-diving

07:05.008 --> 07:07.552
if we really want to get
a good look at the reef.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.263
What are we gonna see down there?

07:09.304 --> 07:11.514
It doesn't look like much from up here.

07:11.556 --> 07:12.682
Just wait, Skipper.

07:12.724 --> 07:14.059
You'll see.

07:14.101 --> 07:17.478
Technically, you're not supposed
to dive in like this, but...

07:17.520 --> 07:19.398
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

07:23.860 --> 07:25.737
Here goes nothing.

07:25.779 --> 07:26.738
Whoo-hoo!

07:29.991 --> 07:31.326
Come on, Skipper.

Yeah, but I never got a good look.

09:17.349 --> 09:18.225
Do you know what it was?

09:18.266 --> 09:20.685
No idea, but it went that way.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.437
What do you say we follow it?

09:22.479 --> 09:23.897
Sure! I have time.

09:28.151 --> 09:29.861
What's that, Mr. Floatie?

09:29.903 --> 09:32.447
You say you can't get enough of this slide?

09:32.489 --> 09:35.325
Well, neither can I!

09:35.367 --> 09:37.785
Whoo-hoo!

09:37.827 --> 09:38.619
Huh?

09:39.620 --> 09:40.705
Whoo!

09:40.747 --> 09:42.249
Hmm...

09:42.290 --> 09:45.460
Stacie, are you still
people-watching?

09:45.502 --> 09:46.920
Nope.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.172
I'm watching Barbie, Ken,
and Skipper on the boat.

09:49.214 --> 09:51.299
Are they coming back already?

09:51.341 --> 09:52.967
Doesn't look like it.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.053
They're headed in the opposite direction.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.430
Let me see!

09:56.471 --> 09:58.973
Where are they going?

09:59.933 --> 10:01.893
What is that thing?

10:03.270 --> 10:07.441
No fair, it's a bright green dolphin!

10:07.482 --> 10:09.067
A green dolphin?

10:09.109 --> 10:10.693
You're dreaming, Chels.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.529
See for yourself.

10:13.905 --> 10:15.782
Are you kidding me?

10:15.823 --> 10:16.699
Told ya.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.243
We have to go check it out!

10:18.285 --> 10:20.036
What are you talking about, "we"?

10:20.078 --> 10:21.496
You can't even walk!

10:23.623 --> 10:24.832
Huh?

10:28.753 --> 10:30.589
I souped up my ride.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.466
Whoa, sweet!

10:32.507 --> 10:33.758
Let's go!

10:33.800 --> 10:34.801
Whoo-hoo!

10:34.842 --> 10:35.760
Hey, wait up!

10:45.186 --> 10:46.146
Emerald!

10:46.187 --> 10:47.188
There you are!

10:48.940 --> 10:51.485
I'm so happy I found you.

10:51.526 --> 10:52.735
Are you okay?

10:54.737 --> 10:55.947
I know.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.865
We need to get you out of here.

11:01.411 --> 11:02.621
I can't get this open.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.289
It's stuck.

11:04.331 --> 11:07.334
Hmm, there must be a way.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.793
Don't worry.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.378
I'll figure it out.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.009
Gotta go, Emerald.

11:16.050 --> 11:17.344
I'll be back.

11:19.678 --> 11:21.431
I'm pretty sure whatever it was we saw

11:21.473 --> 11:23.266
was headed in this direction.

11:23.308 --> 11:25.310
Wow, what is this place?

11:25.352 --> 11:27.562
: This is
the research facility

11:27.604 --> 11:28.605
where I work.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.485
Come on, Chels, move those feet!

11:33.527 --> 11:35.445
Yeah, I'm trying!

11:35.487 --> 11:37.364
Wow!

11:37.405 --> 11:38.490
Whoa!

11:39.949 --> 11:40.908
Hey, guys,

11:40.950 --> 11:42.536
what are you doing here?

11:42.577 --> 11:43.453
Barbie!

11:43.495 --> 11:44.954
You have to see!

11:44.996 --> 11:47.248
What is it?

11:47.290 --> 11:48.416
It's a dolphin.

11:48.458 --> 11:51.252
I know, but he's green.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.214
Looks like the puppies are curious too.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.520
I think he likes you, Taffy.

12:11.565 --> 12:12.607
Hi there, little guy.

12:14.733 --> 12:16.903
I've never seen anything like this.

12:16.944 --> 12:18.196
Neither have I,

12:18.238 --> 12:19.864
but the locals talk

12:19.906 --> 12:21.908
about the myth of the Gemstone Dolphins.

12:21.949 --> 12:23.660
I thought they were just stories,

12:23.702 --> 12:24.869
like the Loch Ness monster.

12:24.911 --> 12:27.121
Is he supposed to be in here, Ken?

12:27.163 --> 12:28.456
Hmm...

12:28.498 --> 12:29.624
I don't know.

12:29.666 --> 12:30.875
I was told this pool

12:30.917 --> 12:32.919
was for rehabilitating
sick or injured animals.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.213
He doesn't look sick or injured.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.550
I wonder if he got himself in
and can't get out?

12:42.512 --> 12:43.930
He seems like he wants out.

12:48.309 --> 12:49.603
Hey!

12:49.644 --> 12:51.187
Get away from there!

12:51.229 --> 12:53.022
Ken, what are you doing?

12:53.064 --> 12:54.649
Why would you endanger this animal

12:54.691 --> 12:56.234
by opening the gate?

12:56.276 --> 12:57.985
We weren't opening the gate.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.572
We thought maybe it was ajar,
and he got in by mistake.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.198
And how would you know?

13:02.240 --> 13:04.284
Are you a dolphin expert?

13:04.325 --> 13:06.453
Well, no, of course not, but...

13:06.494 --> 13:08.663
Uh, Marlo, this is my friend, Barbie.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.582
Barbie, this is Marlo,

13:10.624 --> 13:13.084
my... boss.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.128
Oh.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.879
Nice to meet you, Ken's boss,

13:16.921 --> 13:18.214
who I've heard so much about.

13:22.427 --> 13:23.553
He just seemed like he wanted out,

13:23.595 --> 13:25.639
so I thought maybe he was trapped.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.056
He isn't trapped.

13:27.098 --> 13:28.433
Can't you see he's sick?

13:28.475 --> 13:30.518
He's under observation.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.186
He doesn't seem sick.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.980
Hey, I'm the expert!

13:34.021 --> 13:35.398
Uh, Marlo,

13:35.440 --> 13:37.858
is this one of those Gemstone Dolphins?

13:37.900 --> 13:40.027
It doesn't have the special markings,

13:40.069 --> 13:41.404
and I thought they were just a myth.

13:41.446 --> 13:42.656
Uh...

13:42.697 --> 13:44.991
No, they're not real.

13:45.032 --> 13:47.619
People just make up stories
about things they can't explain.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.162
You mean like mermaids?

13:49.203 --> 13:50.413
They're really just dugongs, right?

13:51.372 --> 13:52.332
Right.

13:52.373 --> 13:54.875
But mermaids are real!

13:54.917 --> 13:56.544
Anything is possible, Chels.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.674
Marlo, are you sure he's sick?

14:00.715 --> 14:03.468
Look, this dolphin got caught
in a fisherman's net

14:03.510 --> 14:04.969
and needs to be checked out.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.596
The vet is flying in from the mainland

14:06.638 --> 14:08.222
tomorrow afternoon.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.350
He'll give the dolphin
a thorough examination

14:10.391 --> 14:12.393
and decide if he's ready to be released.

14:12.435 --> 14:14.688
Now, if you don't mind,

14:14.729 --> 14:17.023
I'd like my research assistant back.

14:17.064 --> 14:18.107
Sorry, Marlo.

14:18.149 --> 14:19.400
I'm here.

14:19.442 --> 14:20.276
Can we help?

14:20.318 --> 14:22.362
No. I don't think so.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.280
In fact, I think your presence here

14:24.322 --> 14:25.239
is stressing out the dolphin.

14:27.325 --> 14:28.993
I'd ask you not to come back

14:29.035 --> 14:31.329
until the vet arrives tomorrow afternoon.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.540
But we just got to meet him!

14:33.581 --> 14:35.291
Then it will be all the easier

14:35.333 --> 14:37.251
to say goodbye tomorrow.

14:39.086 --> 14:40.380
Time to go.

14:40.421 --> 14:41.715
Let's leave him be.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.223
: After you, Marlo.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.599
: Obviously.

15:02.652 --> 15:03.944
Whoa!

15:03.986 --> 15:05.655
What are you?

15:07.365 --> 15:08.241
Shh! Shh!

15:08.282 --> 15:09.409
Quiet down,

15:09.450 --> 15:11.952
dolphins of the land.

15:11.994 --> 15:15.456
That's it, nice and easy.

15:26.634 --> 15:29.554
Now, don't tell anyone you saw me, okay?

15:29.596 --> 15:32.348
It'll be our little secret.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.143
Whoa!

15:37.687 --> 15:41.608
It's been a while since I walked
on these land legs.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.082
How do I get you out of here, Emerald?

16:00.042 --> 16:02.128
What if I just...

16:05.840 --> 16:06.800
Shh!

16:06.841 --> 16:08.509
Okay, okay!

16:08.551 --> 16:09.719
I know you're excited,

16:09.761 --> 16:11.387
but you've got to keep it down.

16:16.810 --> 16:17.852
Wait!

16:17.894 --> 16:19.604
Where are the puppies?

16:20.688 --> 16:21.689
They must be back at the cove.

16:21.731 --> 16:22.774
I'll go get them

16:22.816 --> 16:24.442
and meet you back at the resort.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.152
Better not let Marlo catch you.

16:26.193 --> 16:27.361
I won't.

16:27.403 --> 16:28.780
I'll be right back.

16:33.534 --> 16:34.744
Huh?

16:39.499 --> 16:41.459
I know, Emerald, I'm trying.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.543
Stop.

16:42.585 --> 16:43.670
What are you doing?

16:43.711 --> 16:45.254
Uh... nothing?

16:45.296 --> 16:47.173
You're trying to open the gate.

16:47.214 --> 16:48.591
Well, yes.

16:48.633 --> 16:50.217
It seems to be stuck.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.553
It's not stuck, it's locked.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.848
Well, then, give me a hand.

16:54.889 --> 16:56.307
No, stop, you shouldn't be doing that.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.351
Why?
He needs to be free.

16:58.392 --> 16:59.226
But he's sick.

16:59.268 --> 17:00.144
What?

17:00.186 --> 17:01.646
What are you talking about?

17:01.688 --> 17:03.606
Well, the dolphin expert says he's sick.

17:03.648 --> 17:04.691
He's not sick.

17:04.732 --> 17:06.192
He's fine.

17:06.233 --> 17:08.528
How do you know?
Do you work here?

17:08.569 --> 17:10.029
No.

17:10.069 --> 17:11.781
So, do you live here?

17:11.823 --> 17:14.742
No, but I grew up on an island,

17:14.784 --> 17:17.161
a really remote island.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.913
Okay, so...

17:18.954 --> 17:20.498
So I've seen enough dolphins

17:20.540 --> 17:22.249
to know he's not sick.

17:22.290 --> 17:23.584
He's a Gemstone Dolphin.

17:23.626 --> 17:25.586
He's supposed to be this color.

17:25.627 --> 17:28.214
Really?
That's amazing!

17:28.255 --> 17:30.925
Wait, how do you know
about Gemstone Dolphins?

17:30.967 --> 17:32.301
Have you seen one before?

17:32.343 --> 17:35.137
Uh, yeah... a few.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.890
There are more of them?

17:36.931 --> 17:39.392
Marlo said Gemstone Dolphins didn't exist.

17:39.433 --> 17:40.560
Who?

17:40.601 --> 17:42.436
Marlo's the dolphin expert.

17:42.478 --> 17:44.355
The one who said he's sick
and needs to stay here.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.649
Doesn't sound like an expert to me.

17:46.691 --> 17:48.150
Look, I agree

17:48.192 --> 17:49.402
that the dolphin should be free, but...

17:49.443 --> 17:50.778
But what?

17:50.820 --> 17:52.739
But Marlo's got a vet
coming in from the mainland

17:52.780 --> 17:54.198
tomorrow.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.034
She said the dolphin got caught
in a fisherman's net,

17:56.075 --> 17:57.284
and that he needs to get checked out

17:57.326 --> 17:59.662
before he can be released.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.917
I'm sure you're right,
and he's completely fine,

18:03.958 --> 18:06.711
but isn't it better to be safe than sorry?

18:06.753 --> 18:08.462
It's just one more day.

18:08.504 --> 18:09.797
Hmm...

18:09.839 --> 18:12.091
Okay, I'll make you a deal.

18:12.132 --> 18:15.344
You don't tell Marlo about
the other Gemstone Dolphins,

18:15.386 --> 18:17.263
and I'll wait
until the vet arrives tomorrow.

18:18.472 --> 18:20.516
Deal.

18:24.812 --> 18:26.814
Well, I guess Emerald approves.

18:26.856 --> 18:27.857
"Emerald?"

18:27.899 --> 18:29.442
You know his name?

18:29.483 --> 18:32.278
Uh, well...

18:32.319 --> 18:34.154
I mean, he's green,

18:34.196 --> 18:36.074
so the name sounded right.

18:37.199 --> 18:38.785
: It suits him.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.622
By the way, I'm Barbie.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.082
I'm Isla.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.583
Nice to meet you, Barbie.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.585
Are you here on vacation with your parents?

18:47.627 --> 18:48.962
Oh...

18:49.003 --> 18:50.755
No. I'm on my own.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.131
So are we.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.340
Hey...

18:53.382 --> 18:55.217
Since the vet won't be here till tomorrow,

18:55.259 --> 18:57.428
why don't you come hang
with me and my sisters?

18:57.470 --> 18:59.263
Uh, well...

18:59.305 --> 19:01.557
Unless you have somewhere else to be.

19:01.599 --> 19:03.183
Not that I can think of.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.184
Great.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.104
Follow me.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.521
I'll see you tomorrow for your release.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.651
You're gonna love my sisters.

19:16.405 --> 19:17.531
Hmm...

19:17.573 --> 19:18.908
See any cool birds?

19:18.950 --> 19:20.576
I could add them to my photo blog.

19:20.618 --> 19:22.870
Birds?
Uh... no.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.831
I'm watching people, remember?

19:25.706 --> 19:26.666
What?

19:28.501 --> 19:29.669
Huh...

19:29.710 --> 19:31.462
I'd suggest you keep an eye on your stuff

19:31.504 --> 19:32.588
if you go to the beach.

19:33.798 --> 19:36.050
Puppies, you're back!

19:36.092 --> 19:37.802
Who wants treats?

19:39.929 --> 19:41.305
Hi, guys.

19:41.347 --> 19:42.807
This is my new friend, Isla.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.642
Isla, these are my sisters,

19:44.684 --> 19:46.352
Skipper, Stacie, and Chelsea.

19:46.393 --> 19:47.436
- Hey!
- Hi!

19:47.478 --> 19:48.896
And you've already met the puppies.

19:50.773 --> 19:52.942
Aw... Hi again!

19:55.820 --> 19:58.405
Wow, she really likes you.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.992
Don't forget, it's our secret.

20:04.286 --> 20:06.288
Hi! I'm Chelsea.

20:06.330 --> 20:07.289
Where are you from?

20:07.331 --> 20:08.624
Are you on vacation?

20:08.666 --> 20:10.209
Do you have any sisters?

20:10.250 --> 20:13.295
I'm from a remote...
island place.

20:14.254 --> 20:15.882
No sisters, just me.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.884
Lucky.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.301
Hmm.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.220
You trying to tell us something?

20:21.261 --> 20:22.555
Kidding!

20:23.973 --> 20:26.017
I'm just really
sick of hand-me-downs.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.853
Are those pics from today?

20:28.895 --> 20:30.730
Yeah, I got some good ones.

20:30.771 --> 20:34.984
But I can't stop looking
at that mysterious thing we saw.

20:35.026 --> 20:37.945
I can't tell what it is.

20:37.987 --> 20:39.279
Well, you know,

20:39.321 --> 20:42.241
there are lots of weird
creatures in the sea.

20:42.282 --> 20:43.534
It could be anything.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.453
Hey, maybe it's another Gemstone Dolphin.

20:46.495 --> 20:47.872
- What?
- Where?

20:47.914 --> 20:50.499
I thought you weren't going to tell anyone.

20:50.541 --> 20:53.127
Sorry, I thought you just meant Marlo.

20:53.169 --> 20:55.379
Sisters tell each other everything.

20:55.421 --> 20:58.382
Well, just make sure you don't tell Marlo.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.718
It'll be our little secret, okay?

21:00.760 --> 21:02.970
You can't trust humans, you know?

21:03.012 --> 21:04.430
Humans?

21:04.471 --> 21:06.682
I mean people.

21:08.475 --> 21:11.229
Hang on, is that a sandwich bar?

21:11.270 --> 21:13.106
Did you say sandwiches?

21:13.147 --> 21:15.900
No one loves sandwiches more then me.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.236
You mean like a witch made of sand?

21:19.153 --> 21:20.362
You crack me up!

21:22.489 --> 21:23.908
A little help here?

21:23.950 --> 21:24.951
You're on your own, Stacie.

21:24.992 --> 21:25.743
See ya there!

21:26.619 --> 21:27.828
Hmm.

21:29.247 --> 21:30.206
Look out!
Coming through!

21:30.248 --> 21:31.415
- Whoa!
- Ah!

21:31.457 --> 21:33.500
She's really fast on that thing.

21:35.753 --> 21:37.213
I'll take one of these, and...

21:37.255 --> 21:38.464
another one of these

21:39.966 --> 21:41.634
Guess I'm not the only one

21:41.675 --> 21:43.052
who likes sandwiches.

21:43.094 --> 21:44.929
: Look at all this food!

21:44.971 --> 21:47.223
Where do we even start?

21:47.265 --> 21:48.599
How about over here?

21:48.641 --> 21:49.433
Whoa...

21:51.227 --> 21:54.272
Huh, what is this?

21:54.313 --> 21:56.107
Uh... bread?

21:56.149 --> 21:57.524
Hmm.

21:58.943 --> 22:02.863
Mm! Oh...
I love bread!

22:03.906 --> 22:06.575
It's so... dry.

22:06.617 --> 22:08.995
You're quirky.

22:22.633 --> 22:24.343
Listen, Hugo,

22:24.384 --> 22:27.013
can you make it here earlier
than tomorrow afternoon?

22:27.054 --> 22:28.639
Good.

22:28.681 --> 22:29.765
I want this to be done

22:29.807 --> 22:31.642
before we have an audience watching.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.393
See you bright and early.

22:35.980 --> 22:38.149
Don't worry, little dolphin,

22:38.191 --> 22:41.443
you're going to make me a lot of money.

22:45.948 --> 22:47.241
These s'mores are the best!

22:47.283 --> 22:49.869
See if you can follow it.

22:52.913 --> 22:54.540
It's so obvious.

22:54.581 --> 22:55.541
That one.

22:57.501 --> 22:58.836
How did you do that?

22:58.878 --> 23:00.296
Hey, guys!

23:00.338 --> 23:02.673
Well, look who finally made it.

23:02.715 --> 23:05.176
Oh, wait, this is perfect!
Group selfie!

23:05.218 --> 23:06.468
Smile, guys!

23:06.510 --> 23:07.845
Whoo-hoo!

23:08.929 --> 23:10.806
Whoa!

23:10.848 --> 23:12.516
Isla, have you met Ken yet?

23:12.558 --> 23:14.227
He grew up next door to us.

23:14.268 --> 23:16.062
We think of him like family.

23:16.103 --> 23:18.105
Nice to meet you, Ken, I'm Isla.

23:18.147 --> 23:19.315
Hey!

23:19.357 --> 23:20.941
He's interning here with Marlo.

23:20.983 --> 23:22.609
Oh.

23:22.651 --> 23:23.861
Hey, Isla!

23:23.903 --> 23:24.737
Huh?

23:28.657 --> 23:30.826
So, you're playing shells, huh?

23:30.868 --> 23:32.494
You know it.

23:32.536 --> 23:34.372
She's been trying to beat me for years.

23:34.412 --> 23:36.582
You mean you've been trying to beat me.

23:36.623 --> 23:37.457
You ready?

23:37.499 --> 23:38.751
Bring it!

23:38.792 --> 23:40.002
Here we go again.

23:41.837 --> 23:44.590
Round and round she goes,

23:44.631 --> 23:47.467
where she stops, only I knows.

23:47.509 --> 23:49.469
Sorry, it rhymed.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.471
Oh, I got this.

23:51.513 --> 23:52.514
That one.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.559
You're good.

23:55.601 --> 23:57.228
Just not that good.

23:57.270 --> 23:58.229
What?

23:58.271 --> 24:00.064
What can I say?
I got skills.

24:01.065 --> 24:02.649
Aw...

24:03.776 --> 24:04.818
Whoops!

24:04.860 --> 24:06.528
I got it.

24:09.907 --> 24:11.867
Huh?

24:13.827 --> 24:14.954

25:37.619 --> 25:40.538
Whoa, you guys were great!

25:46.003 --> 25:47.338
I have to be at work early.

25:47.380 --> 25:48.630
I'd better hit the hay.

25:48.672 --> 25:50.383
"Hit the hay"?

25:50.424 --> 25:51.758
I'm pooped.

25:51.800 --> 25:53.177
"Pooped"?

25:53.219 --> 25:55.429
What do you do at work exactly?

25:57.014 --> 25:59.099
Well, I clean the tanks where
we keep the starfish, and...

25:59.141 --> 26:01.435
Why do you keep them in tanks?

26:01.477 --> 26:03.187
So Marlo can study them.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.980
Oh.

26:05.022 --> 26:06.690
That doesn't seem right.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.734
Where's your cabin, Isla?

26:08.775 --> 26:10.194
My... cabin?

26:10.236 --> 26:12.405
Yeah, where are you going to sleep?

26:12.446 --> 26:15.282
Oh... I'm sleeping
on the beach.

26:17.159 --> 26:18.744
She kills me, this one.

26:21.205 --> 26:22.331
Wait, you're serious?

26:22.373 --> 26:24.458
Why not stay with us instead?

26:24.500 --> 26:26.043
We have plenty of room.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.836
And I can take the puppies.

26:27.878 --> 26:29.046
That's perfect!

26:29.088 --> 26:30.172
Thanks, Ken.

26:30.214 --> 26:31.257
Isla, you in?

26:31.298 --> 26:32.799
Okay.

26:32.841 --> 26:34.676
You know what this means, right?

26:35.886 --> 26:37.888
Sleepover!

26:42.684 --> 26:44.395
I think I ate too many s'mores!

26:44.437 --> 26:45.354
Whoo!

26:45.396 --> 26:46.604
Here you go.

26:46.646 --> 26:48.482
Thanks.

26:48.524 --> 26:50.150
Always carry a spare.

26:50.192 --> 26:52.319
She's, like,
uber-prepared.

26:52.361 --> 26:53.487
Oof!

26:55.197 --> 26:56.198
Hmm...

26:57.533 --> 26:59.285
Well, thank you

26:59.326 --> 27:00.702
for letting me borrow your clothes,

27:00.744 --> 27:02.371
and this, um...

27:02.413 --> 27:03.830
Uh... toothbrush?

27:05.165 --> 27:07.585
Right.

27:07.625 --> 27:09.587
We love an excuse for a sleepover.

27:10.628 --> 27:11.589
Whoa!

27:11.629 --> 27:12.630
Heads up!

27:12.672 --> 27:14.841
This looks great.

27:16.343 --> 27:17.428
Oh...

27:17.470 --> 27:21.599
This is the softest thing in the world.

27:25.311 --> 27:28.230
If I slept on something like this,

27:28.272 --> 27:31.191
I would literally never get up.

27:32.067 --> 27:32.859
Ever!

27:40.242 --> 27:41.743
Well, I guess the sleepover

27:41.785 --> 27:43.996
has officially moved to the "sleep" part.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.625
Okay...

28:02.389 --> 28:04.057
Isla...

28:04.099 --> 28:06.810
Isla, are you awake?

28:06.852 --> 28:08.020
Huh?

28:09.021 --> 28:10.856
Isla..!

28:10.897 --> 28:12.316
Chels.

28:15.735 --> 28:16.903
Whoo-whoo!

28:16.945 --> 28:18.822
♪ I get my boot off today ♪

28:18.864 --> 28:20.658
♪ I get my boot off today ♪

28:20.698 --> 28:22.284
Whoo!

28:22.326 --> 28:24.286
That's great, Stace.

28:24.328 --> 28:27.164
That's right, I almost forgot.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.291
Well, she's gotta get up sometime.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.884
Whoa, impressive.

28:38.925 --> 28:40.469
She was serious.

28:40.511 --> 28:42.179
She's never getting up.

28:46.642 --> 28:47.893
Hi, Honey!

28:49.019 --> 28:51.146
Cutest alarm clock ever.

28:51.188 --> 28:53.315
Hi, guys. Bye, guys.

28:53.357 --> 28:54.441
Sorry, duty calls.

28:54.483 --> 28:55.817
Ken, wait!

28:55.859 --> 28:57.110
When does the vet get here?

28:57.152 --> 28:58.278
This afternoon.

28:58.320 --> 28:59.572
The dolphin looks great.

28:59.613 --> 29:01.323
I'm sure the vet will
give him the all-clear.

29:01.365 --> 29:02.533
I hope so.

29:02.575 --> 29:03.909
We'll come by later to say goodbye to him.

29:03.950 --> 29:04.826
Cool!

29:04.868 --> 29:06.786
I'll see you guys there.

29:06.828 --> 29:08.414
How's it going over there?

29:09.498 --> 29:10.457
Nothing.

29:10.499 --> 29:12.543
I think I know what'll work.

29:12.585 --> 29:14.670
Breakfast sandwiches!

29:15.671 --> 29:16.755
I'm up!

29:18.090 --> 29:19.258
Mm...

29:19.299 --> 29:23.303
Who knew sandwiches
were good any time of day?

29:23.345 --> 29:24.638
It's official,

29:24.680 --> 29:27.307
you like sandwiches way more than me.

29:28.308 --> 29:29.727
That was great,

29:29.768 --> 29:32.354
but now I need to go see Emerald.

29:32.396 --> 29:33.772
I don't think there's much we can do

29:33.813 --> 29:35.399
until the vet arrives.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.735
Plus, Ken is there.
He'll look after him.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.903
Hey, how about we go for a swim?

29:39.945 --> 29:41.196
It'll take your mind off of it.

29:41.238 --> 29:43.699
Uh... I don't know.

29:43.741 --> 29:45.743
Oh, come on.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.202
Okay, sure.

29:47.244 --> 29:48.704
Let's go!

29:57.170 --> 29:58.547
Whoo-hoo!

30:06.054 --> 30:07.889
Wow!

30:07.931 --> 30:09.516
Gemstone Dolphins!

30:09.558 --> 30:11.351
This is amazing!

30:12.436 --> 30:14.229
Look at their colors!

30:14.271 --> 30:16.482
This is so cool.

30:22.613 --> 30:25.240
Isla, this is incredible.

30:25.282 --> 30:27.951
I know, it never gets old.

30:27.993 --> 30:28.952
What?

30:28.994 --> 30:30.621
You've done this before?

30:30.663 --> 30:32.205
Uh...

30:33.039 --> 30:33.957
Ruby!

30:33.999 --> 30:35.375
Wait, "Ruby?"

30:35.417 --> 30:36.543
How do you know her name?

30:37.461 --> 30:38.878
Hey!

30:42.048 --> 30:43.008
Ruby, no!

30:45.260 --> 30:46.679
Uh...

31:12.078 --> 31:13.831
What in the...?

31:17.959 --> 31:18.794
Isla?

31:18.836 --> 31:20.671
So...

31:20.713 --> 31:21.755
You're a...

31:21.797 --> 31:22.922
Mermaid.

31:22.964 --> 31:24.383
Yes! A mermaid!

31:24.424 --> 31:25.467
But, but...

31:25.509 --> 31:27.093
Don't freak out, okay?

31:27.135 --> 31:29.137
Are you kidding?

31:30.222 --> 31:32.850
This is the coolest thing ever!

31:32.891 --> 31:34.601
I mean, how did this happen?

31:34.643 --> 31:35.977
Were you born with a tail?

31:36.019 --> 31:37.020
Do you have magical powers?

31:37.062 --> 31:38.104
Can you talk to dolphins?

31:38.146 --> 31:39.356
Are you even human?

31:40.440 --> 31:41.859
Slow down.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.152
Yes, I was born a mermaid,

31:44.194 --> 31:45.278
with a tail.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.155
Magical powers?

31:47.197 --> 31:48.073
I guess so.

31:48.114 --> 31:49.199
Your necklace!

31:49.241 --> 31:50.367
Uh-huh.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.160
The necklace lets me
switch from tail to legs

31:52.202 --> 31:53.453
and back again.

31:53.495 --> 31:55.205
But Ruby knows the trick,

31:55.247 --> 31:57.082
and likes me better with a tail.

31:57.123 --> 31:59.251
I can't exactly talk to dolphins.

31:59.292 --> 32:01.920
It's more like we "get" each other.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.594
Barbie, this is Topaz...

32:10.345 --> 32:11.722
Amethyst...

32:11.764 --> 32:12.598
...and Ruby.

32:14.349 --> 32:16.810
Guys, this is my friend, Barbie.

32:16.852 --> 32:19.229
Hi, guys!
Nice to meet you.

32:21.523 --> 32:22.733
Show off.

32:24.401 --> 32:27.613
And no, I'm not technically human.

32:27.654 --> 32:30.949
But listen, remember what I said

32:30.990 --> 32:33.034
about not being able to trust people?

32:33.076 --> 32:35.120
Yes, but I would never...

32:35.161 --> 32:37.163
Not you, Barbie, of course not.

32:37.205 --> 32:39.332
But not everyone is like you.

32:39.374 --> 32:41.000
Some people would try to take advantage

32:41.042 --> 32:42.711
of others' specialness.

32:42.753 --> 32:44.922
You can't tell anyone,

32:44.963 --> 32:46.339
not even your sisters.

32:46.381 --> 32:47.591
But...

32:47.633 --> 32:48.759
Not because I don't trust them,

32:48.801 --> 32:50.093
I do.

32:50.135 --> 32:52.429
But the more people who know a secret,

32:52.471 --> 32:54.807
the more chance it will get out.

32:54.848 --> 32:56.141
Of course.

32:56.182 --> 32:57.601
I understand.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.519
Your secret is safe with me.

32:59.561 --> 33:00.520
I promise.

33:00.562 --> 33:02.606
Thank you.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.983
I just need to know one thing.

33:05.024 --> 33:06.359
Yeah?

33:06.401 --> 33:08.821
Can you teach me to swim like a mermaid?

33:10.071 --> 33:11.490
I think so!

33:16.035 --> 33:18.163
You're already a really strong swimmer,

33:18.204 --> 33:21.374
but... this will help.

33:26.797 --> 33:28.089
You'll have more power

33:28.131 --> 33:30.467
if you move your legs like they're one.

33:32.678 --> 33:35.096
So cool!

33:35.138 --> 33:36.181
Now you try it.

33:44.105 --> 33:45.774
That's so fun!

33:45.816 --> 33:47.651
That was great!

33:47.693 --> 33:48.819

You go, girl.

34:39.995 --> 34:42.664
It's good to be out of that boot.

34:42.706 --> 34:44.958
But it was kind of nice

34:45.000 --> 34:46.710
to be forced to just sit and stare all day.

34:46.752 --> 34:48.795
More like stare at people all day.

34:48.837 --> 34:49.795
What?

34:49.838 --> 34:51.840
I've been observing nature.

34:51.882 --> 34:54.342
But now I can do all kinds of stuff,

34:54.384 --> 34:56.094
like body board, and surf,

34:56.135 --> 34:57.637
and swim with that green dolphin.

34:57.679 --> 34:59.305
Easy there, tiger shark.

34:59.347 --> 35:00.098
One thing at a time.

35:00.139 --> 35:01.182
Besides,

35:01.224 --> 35:02.684
I don't think Marlo's going to let you

35:02.726 --> 35:04.519
anywhere near that dolphin.

35:04.561 --> 35:07.898
Yeah, she seems a bit strange.

35:07.940 --> 35:10.442
Yeah, I know what you mean.

35:10.483 --> 35:11.818
Hmm...

35:11.860 --> 35:14.988
I think I could get more out of this image.

35:15.030 --> 35:16.698
I'm running it through a filter.

35:16.740 --> 35:18.575
Hey, Skip, check out the helicopter.

35:24.581 --> 35:26.625
Sweet! Photo op!

35:28.126 --> 35:30.211
Hey, Marlo's waving it in.

35:30.253 --> 35:31.671
That must be the vet.

35:31.713 --> 35:32.881
That's him?

35:32.923 --> 35:35.133
I thought he wasn't coming
till this afternoon.

35:36.969 --> 35:37.928
What?

35:37.970 --> 35:40.430
Now you're both
people-watching?

35:40.472 --> 35:42.265
I thought Stacie getting out of the boot

35:42.307 --> 35:44.350
meant we could go do stuff.

35:44.392 --> 35:45.393
It does.

35:45.435 --> 35:46.394
Let's go find Barbie

35:46.436 --> 35:47.729
and tell her the vet is here.

35:47.771 --> 35:50.189
We don't want to miss
saying goodbye to Emerald.

35:52.609 --> 35:53.735
Huh?

35:53.777 --> 35:55.194
Hey, wait up!

36:10.085 --> 36:12.712
Hey, do you hear that?

36:12.754 --> 36:14.213
It sounds like Emerald.

36:14.255 --> 36:18.259
I wonder why we can hear him
this far from the cove.

36:20.053 --> 36:21.138
Come on!

36:27.644 --> 36:29.228
The clicking came from this spot.

36:38.738 --> 36:40.406
Hey, there's a cave down there!

36:40.448 --> 36:41.491
Really?

36:41.533 --> 36:43.451
Perhaps it's a tunnel to the cove.

36:43.493 --> 36:44.452
Wait here.

36:44.494 --> 36:47.164
I'll go check it out with Ruby.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.582
I'll just be here, uh, floating.

36:58.133 --> 37:00.802
: Any luck
with that mystery image?

37:00.844 --> 37:03.930
This filter is taking forever.

37:03.972 --> 37:06.141
Whoa...

37:06.183 --> 37:08.309
That's some serious machinery.

37:16.526 --> 37:18.070
Rookie, Taffy, wait up!

37:18.111 --> 37:19.237
Follow those dogs!

37:29.206 --> 37:31.583
Man, that crab gets around.

37:31.624 --> 37:33.168
Aw...

37:33.210 --> 37:35.503
cute walrus!

37:35.545 --> 37:37.214
Hmm, kind of a weird logo for a vet...

37:37.255 --> 37:38.423
: The sooner
we get him out of here,

37:38.464 --> 37:39.674
the better.

37:39.716 --> 37:41.551
I want him transported
to the mainland facility

37:41.593 --> 37:43.636
safely and immediately.

37:43.678 --> 37:46.723
That Gemstone Dolphin's
gonna make you a fortune.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.350
And my rates just went up.

37:49.392 --> 37:50.936
Let me be clear.

37:50.977 --> 37:53.646
That dolphin is going to make me a fortune.

37:53.688 --> 37:54.814
You won't see a dime of it

37:54.856 --> 37:57.275
if we don't take off in an hour.

37:57.316 --> 37:59.069
Get everything ready.

37:59.111 --> 38:01.362
The sooner we get him
out of here, the better.

38:08.078 --> 38:10.038
Did I just hear that right?

38:10.080 --> 38:11.998
So he's not a vet?

38:12.040 --> 38:15.085
No, and we need to find Barbie, quick.

38:18.046 --> 38:19.798
Come on, Skip.

38:19.839 --> 38:20.924
Hang on a sec.

38:32.602 --> 38:34.437
What did you find?

38:34.479 --> 38:36.231
There's a maze of tunnels down there,

38:36.273 --> 38:37.607
but it's too confusing.

38:37.649 --> 38:38.942
We kept getting lost.

38:38.984 --> 38:40.318
Right, Ruby?

38:40.359 --> 38:41.444
Ruby?

38:42.445 --> 38:43.863
Where'd she go?

38:43.905 --> 38:45.991
And where's Amethyst and Topaz?

38:46.032 --> 38:47.492
They must have headed to the cove.

38:52.789 --> 38:54.373
Aw, you look scared.

38:54.415 --> 38:55.625
Don't worry, little buddy.

38:55.667 --> 38:56.626
The vet will be here soon...

38:56.668 --> 38:57.752
Ken!

38:57.794 --> 38:59.879
Stop pestering that dolphin!

38:59.921 --> 39:02.340
Uh, I was just checking on him.

39:02.381 --> 39:03.508
He seemed sad.

39:03.549 --> 39:05.010
He's fine.

39:06.594 --> 39:07.637
See?

39:08.471 --> 39:09.347
Huh?

39:11.099 --> 39:12.225
Are those...

39:12.267 --> 39:13.935
It can't be.

39:15.145 --> 39:16.437
Ken, quick,

39:16.479 --> 39:18.273
open the gate and let them in.

39:18.315 --> 39:19.899
They're stressing him out!

39:24.863 --> 39:26.281
Uh... what's the code?

39:26.323 --> 39:28.741
4-8-3-5-6.

39:40.045 --> 39:40.879
Huh...?

39:40.920 --> 39:41.671
The markings...

39:49.012 --> 39:51.848
An entire family of Gemstone Dolphins!

39:51.890 --> 39:53.183
I can't believe this.

39:53.225 --> 39:55.393
Ken, quick, close the gate!

39:55.434 --> 39:56.811
Are you sure?

39:56.853 --> 39:58.146
Now!
Before they get out!

39:58.188 --> 39:59.231
You're the boss.

40:09.366 --> 40:11.659
Don't let them out.

40:11.701 --> 40:13.995
I'll be right back.

40:19.584 --> 40:21.253
I knew there was something
weird about Marlo.

40:23.296 --> 40:24.339
Really, Honey?

40:24.381 --> 40:25.631
You have to go now?

40:27.800 --> 40:29.510
Fine...

40:35.267 --> 40:37.518
Hugo, I'm on my way,

40:37.560 --> 40:39.104
and we're gonna need more nets.

40:40.355 --> 40:41.439
Quick, it's Marlo.

40:41.480 --> 40:42.899
Hide!

40:44.525 --> 40:45.318
What's she doing out here?

40:45.360 --> 40:46.319
Shh!

40:46.361 --> 40:47.237
What?

40:47.279 --> 40:48.654
You need more time?

40:48.696 --> 40:49.864
Who's she talking to?

40:49.906 --> 40:50.949
Shh!

40:51.908 --> 40:53.326
The image.

40:53.368 --> 40:55.161
It's a mermaid!

40:55.203 --> 40:56.537
It's a real mermaid...

40:56.579 --> 40:57.455
Shh!

40:57.496 --> 40:59.249
Hold on.

40:59.291 --> 41:00.333
Who's there?

41:01.960 --> 41:03.836
Hmm...

41:03.878 --> 41:05.546
Anyway, just make it quick.

41:07.924 --> 41:09.384
Come on, let's go.

41:11.844 --> 41:12.762
Oh no!

41:12.804 --> 41:14.513
The dolphins!

41:17.183 --> 41:18.559
Hey! Open the gate!

41:18.601 --> 41:20.061
Ken, what are you doing?

41:20.103 --> 41:22.105
Marlo wanted to bring them

41:22.147 --> 41:23.522
to make Emerald feel more comfortable.

41:23.564 --> 41:24.690
He's stressed.

41:24.732 --> 41:26.401
She didn't bring them in.

41:26.443 --> 41:27.986
She trapped them.

41:28.027 --> 41:29.279
You need to let them back out.

41:29.321 --> 41:30.488
What are you talking about?

41:30.529 --> 41:31.864
Ken, please help.

41:31.906 --> 41:33.491
I'll explain later, I promise.

41:33.532 --> 41:34.867
Uh...

41:38.704 --> 41:40.665
Please, Ken, we don't have much time!

41:41.707 --> 41:43.501
Okay.

41:43.542 --> 41:45.837
I... think I can
remember the code.

41:48.340 --> 41:50.008
What?
That's gotta be the number!

41:52.510 --> 41:54.637
How is that wrong?
She just told me!

41:54.679 --> 41:57.556
I never should have trusted you!

41:57.598 --> 41:59.184
I could have gotten him out on my own,

41:59.225 --> 42:00.810
but now they're all trapped!

42:00.852 --> 42:02.603
Isla, I'm so sorry.

42:02.645 --> 42:03.729
I didn't know.

42:03.771 --> 42:05.815
No. You didn't.

42:05.857 --> 42:07.900
I'll figure it out myself.

42:07.942 --> 42:09.735
Isla, wait!

42:12.738 --> 42:14.240
Barbie!

42:14.282 --> 42:15.867
Marlo's up to something!

42:15.908 --> 42:18.286
This guy, Hugo, arrived by helicopter,

42:18.328 --> 42:20.038
and he's definitely not a vet!

42:20.079 --> 42:21.373
What?

42:21.414 --> 42:23.666
I took a picture of the logo
from the helicopter

42:23.708 --> 42:25.877
and ran a recognition scan over the web.

42:25.918 --> 42:28.087
The helicopter is from a sideshow company,

42:28.129 --> 42:30.089
and Hugo owns it.

42:30.131 --> 42:31.841
Are you serious?

42:31.883 --> 42:34.219
Oh, and Skipper saw a mermaid.

42:34.260 --> 42:35.553
That picture I took?

42:35.594 --> 42:37.222
It's of a mermaid!

42:38.264 --> 42:39.057
Isla...

42:39.098 --> 42:39.974
Really?

42:40.016 --> 42:41.434
A mermaid?

42:41.476 --> 42:44.521
Marlo wants the Gemstone
Dolphins for herself!

42:44.562 --> 42:46.772
That's exactly what Isla said.

42:46.814 --> 42:48.649
Marlo?
How could she?

42:48.691 --> 42:50.776
She's supposed to be helping the dolphins.

42:50.818 --> 42:52.070
Okay.

42:52.111 --> 42:53.612
We have to get them out of here.

42:53.654 --> 42:56.282
Ken, you've got to try
the code one more time.

42:56.324 --> 42:58.617
All right, I'll give it a shot.

43:01.287 --> 43:03.122
Too many passcode attempts.

43:03.164 --> 43:04.665
User locked out.

43:04.707 --> 43:06.501
New code sent to master device.

43:06.543 --> 43:07.460
What!?

43:07.502 --> 43:09.379
Ken, what's the master device?

43:09.421 --> 43:10.380
It must be that little remote

43:10.422 --> 43:12.131
Marlo's been carrying around.

43:12.173 --> 43:13.591
I wondered what it was.

43:13.632 --> 43:14.926
Hmm...

43:14.967 --> 43:16.886
Okay, I have a plan,

43:16.928 --> 43:19.222
but I'm gonna need everybody's help.

43:19.264 --> 43:21.182
- You got it.
- Sure.

43:21.224 --> 43:23.768
: Ken, you're
with Chelsea and the pups.

43:23.809 --> 43:25.728
You need to keep Marlo occupied long enough

43:25.770 --> 43:27.146
for Chelsea to get the master device

43:27.188 --> 43:27.980
to Stacie and Skipper...

43:29.441 --> 43:31.443
Skipper, once you have the master device,

43:31.484 --> 43:33.194
you need to sync it to your tablet,

43:33.236 --> 43:35.154
and download the new passcode.

43:35.196 --> 43:36.531
Stacie, you're going to be

43:36.573 --> 43:38.783
the eyes and ears of this operation...

43:38.824 --> 43:40.659
I'll come up with a distraction
if we need it.

43:40.701 --> 43:41.911
But first,

43:41.953 --> 43:43.829
I need to fix things with Isla.

43:49.502 --> 43:50.669
Hey, Isla.

43:50.711 --> 43:53.381
Hello, Barbie.

43:53.423 --> 43:55.425
Isla, I was wrong.

43:55.467 --> 43:56.426
I'm sorry.

43:56.468 --> 43:58.094
You were right about everything,

43:58.136 --> 44:00.263
Marlo isn't to be trusted at all.

44:00.305 --> 44:02.474
She does want to exploit the dolphins.

44:02.515 --> 44:04.934
I'm not surprised.

44:04.976 --> 44:06.478
I can't take it back,

44:06.519 --> 44:08.438
but I can say I'm sorry.

44:10.731 --> 44:14.152
I have a plan to fix it,
but we need your help.

44:14.193 --> 44:16.904
Count me in, and thank you, Barbie.

44:35.714 --> 44:37.842
Showtime.

44:38.884 --> 44:40.637
Hey, Marlo!

44:41.638 --> 44:42.639
Hey, how's it going?

44:42.680 --> 44:43.973
Having some lunch, I see.

44:44.015 --> 44:45.266
Good lunch?

44:45.308 --> 44:46.142
What's for lunch?

44:48.561 --> 44:49.770
Ken...

44:49.812 --> 44:51.314
Finished your morning tasks already?

44:51.356 --> 44:52.524
Yup.

44:52.565 --> 44:54.733
I cleaned the palm fronds out of the tank,

44:54.775 --> 44:56.027
and checked the water level.

44:56.068 --> 44:59.780
Then... I recorded
the temperature

44:59.822 --> 45:01.366
and collected a sample.

45:01.407 --> 45:03.368
I checked the sample in the lab.

45:03.409 --> 45:04.701
Boom!

45:04.743 --> 45:07.038
Looked like normal
wet, wet water, nothing fishy.

45:07.079 --> 45:08.039
"Fishy..."

45:09.624 --> 45:12.377
Anyway, uh...

45:12.418 --> 45:14.504
What's next?
What are we doing next?

45:16.130 --> 45:17.382
Gross!

45:17.423 --> 45:18.550
Who let a dog in here?

45:18.591 --> 45:20.218
Gross, gross, gross!

45:20.259 --> 45:21.844
Aah!
I'm allergic to fleas!

45:21.886 --> 45:23.012
Aah! There's one
on me right now!

45:23.054 --> 45:23.971
Get them out of here!

45:24.013 --> 45:25.515
Shoo! Out!

45:26.474 --> 45:28.643
Is this your dog?

45:28.685 --> 45:30.269
Oops. Sorry.

45:30.311 --> 45:31.563
I'm trying to eat.

45:31.604 --> 45:33.398
Go play somewhere else.

45:33.439 --> 45:34.190
Okay.

45:35.149 --> 45:36.984
So, Marlo...

45:39.404 --> 45:41.489
What-what are we
doing next?

45:41.531 --> 45:42.948
Swimming with the dolphin?

45:42.990 --> 45:45.159
Uh, playing with the dolphin?

45:45.201 --> 45:46.743
Feeding the dolphin snacks?

45:48.954 --> 45:50.164
Here you go.

45:50.206 --> 45:51.249
Nice work, Chels.

45:53.543 --> 45:55.628
We have dolphin snacks, right?

45:56.795 --> 45:58.631
We do not have dolphin snacks.

45:58.673 --> 46:00.383
Go check the radio antenna

46:00.425 --> 46:01.634
if you're looking for something to do.

46:01.676 --> 46:03.802
Come on, come on!

46:03.844 --> 46:04.761
Great!

46:04.803 --> 46:07.473
Great, gr... eat!

46:08.683 --> 46:10.184
Great. Consider it done.

46:10.226 --> 46:11.852
Uh, then, then...
then what?

46:13.020 --> 46:14.980
Why don't you start with that for now?

46:15.022 --> 46:16.315
I've got to go.

46:19.652 --> 46:21.070
Clear these.

46:21.112 --> 46:22.405
Now!

46:25.617 --> 46:27.076
What was that?

46:28.160 --> 46:29.621
Huh?

46:29.662 --> 46:30.747
Where did it go?

46:33.999 --> 46:36.210
A mermaid?

46:37.794 --> 46:39.422
It's hanging!

46:39.464 --> 46:41.924
Get back there and be ready!

46:41.966 --> 46:45.177
Oh, uh, keep watching!
It might come back!

46:46.304 --> 46:48.180
We're running out of time.

46:48.222 --> 46:50.182
Come on!

46:51.100 --> 46:52.351
Yes!

46:52.393 --> 46:53.269
Done!

46:53.311 --> 46:54.186
Quick, put it back!

47:03.571 --> 47:05.448
Huh, I guess it's gone.

47:05.490 --> 47:07.283
Well, we could wait for it to come back,

47:07.325 --> 47:09.452
but, uh, I don't think it's gonna.

47:11.162 --> 47:12.330
Huh?

47:12.371 --> 47:14.457
Well, I better get back to work.

47:22.340 --> 47:24.634
Hmm...

47:25.760 --> 47:26.636
Whoo-hoo!

47:26.678 --> 47:28.179
You guys were amazing!

47:28.220 --> 47:30.765
And you came up with
a brilliant plan, Barbie.

47:30.807 --> 47:32.141
How did you get Isla

47:32.183 --> 47:33.810
to look so much like a mermaid?

47:33.850 --> 47:36.270
Oh, we just improvised.

47:36.312 --> 47:38.981
Special effects and stuff.

47:41.818 --> 47:44.403
I can't thank you all enough.

47:44.445 --> 47:46.030
But especially Barbie.

47:46.071 --> 47:48.741
You've been such a good friend to me.

47:48.783 --> 47:50.951
And it's a hard thing to ask a friend

47:50.993 --> 47:53.120
to keep a secret for you.

47:53.162 --> 47:55.164
Especially from her sisters.

47:55.206 --> 47:57.249
What?

47:57.291 --> 47:58.626
So...

48:07.343 --> 48:08.260
Huh?

48:08.302 --> 48:09.345
Wow!

48:09.387 --> 48:11.096
Whoa!

48:11.138 --> 48:13.224
A real mermaid!

48:16.394 --> 48:18.730
You're the mermaid from my photo!

48:18.771 --> 48:19.605
See?

48:19.647 --> 48:21.190
I rest my case.

48:25.403 --> 48:28.155
Thank you guys for keeping my secret too.

48:28.197 --> 48:30.408
And these are my puppies of the sea.

48:30.449 --> 48:31.576
You know Emerald,

48:31.617 --> 48:34.328
and this is Topaz, Amethyst, and Ruby!

48:36.080 --> 48:37.914
Cool!
-Wow! -Sweet!

48:37.956 --> 48:38.999
Hiya, guys!

48:39.041 --> 48:41.918
Now, let's get you out of here.

48:41.960 --> 48:44.589
Yeah. I'm on it.

48:52.638 --> 48:54.181
Here comes freedom!

48:54.223 --> 48:55.349
Yeah!

48:56.308 --> 48:57.184
What?

48:57.226 --> 48:58.770
User locked out.

48:58.811 --> 49:00.855
New code sent to master device.

49:00.897 --> 49:02.106
That should have worked!

49:02.147 --> 49:03.649
It can't be.

49:05.777 --> 49:06.819
Come on! Come on!

49:07.695 --> 49:09.029
User locked out.

49:09.071 --> 49:11.031
New code sent to master device.

49:12.241 --> 49:13.826
You looking for this?

49:19.665 --> 49:21.542
When I realized you'd hacked my device,

49:21.584 --> 49:22.710
I reprogrammed it.

49:24.002 --> 49:25.797
But it doesn't matter.

49:25.838 --> 49:28.299
I'm taking the dolphins out by helicopter.

49:28.340 --> 49:30.468
I don't actually need to open the gate.

49:34.931 --> 49:35.807
No!

49:35.848 --> 49:37.182
You can't do this!

49:37.224 --> 49:40.394
Already done, sweetheart.

49:41.646 --> 49:42.772
What?

49:44.064 --> 49:45.107
Where are the dolphins?

49:46.901 --> 49:49.236
I didn't want to spoil
your dramatic moment, but...

49:49.278 --> 49:50.822
they escaped.

49:50.863 --> 49:53.491
There's no way they could get out!

49:53.532 --> 49:55.827
They're probably miles out to sea by now.

49:55.868 --> 49:57.662
Hugo!

49:57.703 --> 50:00.331
We've got to get that helicopter in the air!

50:00.372 --> 50:01.916
Do you think they really got out?

50:01.958 --> 50:03.334
I'm not sure.

50:06.963 --> 50:08.339
Where were you?

50:08.380 --> 50:11.342
We found a hiding place
which was actually a tunnel.

50:11.383 --> 50:12.510
I thought it might be connected

50:12.551 --> 50:15.011
to that cave we found earlier, Barbie,

50:15.053 --> 50:16.347
but we couldn't find a way through.

50:16.388 --> 50:18.557
Every turn we took led us back here.

50:18.599 --> 50:20.184
If only we had some way

50:20.225 --> 50:22.144
to guide them through the tunnels,

50:22.186 --> 50:23.896
some signal from the other side.

50:25.147 --> 50:27.859
Barbie, you're a genius.

50:31.529 --> 50:33.405
I've got something that might do the trick.

50:33.447 --> 50:34.657
Really?

50:40.579 --> 50:41.789
Wow!

50:43.833 --> 50:45.167
Here, take this.

50:45.209 --> 50:47.211
Go to the rocks on the other side.

50:47.252 --> 50:48.337
When you get there,

50:48.379 --> 50:49.839
hold this in your hand.

50:49.881 --> 50:50.965
It's something mermaids use

50:51.007 --> 50:53.843
to find each other in the vast ocean.

50:53.885 --> 50:56.052
If two merpeople each hold a shell,

50:56.094 --> 50:58.389
it creates a current of light and color

50:58.430 --> 51:00.892
that can be followed underwater.

51:00.933 --> 51:02.560
It should also work
with friends of mermaids,

51:02.601 --> 51:04.144
and it will lead me right to you.

51:04.186 --> 51:06.438
Great, we'll give it a shot.

51:06.480 --> 51:07.732
Let's go, Stacie.

51:08.733 --> 51:11.360
Wait, hold up, Stace!

51:13.988 --> 51:15.489
Here, take this

51:15.531 --> 51:16.991
in case your leg gets tired.

51:17.033 --> 51:18.074
Thanks, Ken!

51:18.116 --> 51:19.159
We'll stay here

51:19.201 --> 51:21.037
and keep an eye out for Marlo!

51:21.077 --> 51:23.205
Sounds good!

51:25.624 --> 51:26.709
This is the spot.

51:26.751 --> 51:28.544
Keep an eye out for the helicopter.

51:28.586 --> 51:29.962
Got it!

52:12.088 --> 52:12.922
Whoa!

52:12.964 --> 52:14.214
Whoo-hoo!

52:14.256 --> 52:15.967
Yes!

52:16.008 --> 52:17.927
It's working!

52:17.969 --> 52:20.721
We'll see you on the other side!

52:20.763 --> 52:22.473
Yeah! Whoo!

52:22.514 --> 52:23.682
Huh?

52:24.516 --> 52:25.309
Oh no.

52:27.519 --> 52:28.604
What?

52:28.646 --> 52:30.522
They were there the whole time?

52:30.564 --> 52:32.190
Follow them, Hugo!
They're escaping!

52:33.734 --> 52:35.069
Let's go.

52:37.655 --> 52:38.864
The magic is working,

52:38.906 --> 52:40.365
but they haven't made their way through yet.

52:41.909 --> 52:43.077
The helicopter!
Hide!

53:03.555 --> 53:04.807
The magic stopped,

53:04.849 --> 53:05.891
and there's still no sign of them.

53:05.933 --> 53:07.559
Oh no!

53:12.564 --> 53:14.358
Yes!

53:15.442 --> 53:16.276
It worked!

53:16.318 --> 53:18.320
You made it!

53:18.362 --> 53:21.197
Barbie, thank you, thank you, thank you!

53:27.121 --> 53:28.122
Get in!

53:28.164 --> 53:30.206
We can get you out of here, fast!

53:30.248 --> 53:31.750
Hurry, hurry!

53:37.715 --> 53:40.258
What do we have here?

53:41.927 --> 53:43.888
Ken, Go!

53:47.432 --> 53:48.475
Oh, ho, ho...

53:48.517 --> 53:50.102
You want a chase, do you?

53:50.144 --> 53:52.312
After them, Hugo!

53:52.354 --> 53:53.981
Try to lose them, Ken!

54:05.576 --> 54:07.119
They're still on us!

54:09.747 --> 54:11.165
What are we going to do?

54:14.585 --> 54:16.252
Faster, Hugo, keep on them!

54:16.294 --> 54:17.838
They're trying
to out-maneuver us.

54:21.050 --> 54:22.300
What?
Where are they?

54:22.342 --> 54:25.054
We can't let them escape!

54:25.096 --> 54:26.805
I think we lost them, but not for long.

54:26.847 --> 54:28.473
We need a plan.

54:28.515 --> 54:30.809
There's a fast-moving current
just off shore.

54:30.851 --> 54:34.146
If we can make it there,
we can get far away quickly.

54:34.188 --> 54:36.398
Then I guess this is goodbye.

54:36.440 --> 54:38.192
I'm going to miss you, Isla.

54:38.234 --> 54:40.194
I'll miss you too.

54:40.236 --> 54:42.113
Here.
This belongs to you.

54:42.154 --> 54:43.822
Please.
Keep it.

54:43.864 --> 54:45.199
Uh, guys?

54:45.241 --> 54:47.451
It's getting really shallow here.

54:49.870 --> 54:50.996
Hold on!

54:51.038 --> 54:52.581
Whoa!

54:52.623 --> 54:54.750
This is as far as we can go.

54:54.792 --> 54:56.668
They found us!

54:56.710 --> 54:58.003
There!

54:58.045 --> 54:59.171
Ha ha!

55:02.049 --> 55:03.675
I know.

55:03.717 --> 55:06.470
I have to swim with the dolphins from here.

55:06.511 --> 55:07.679
Thank you, Barbie.

55:07.721 --> 55:09.265
Thank you all for everything you've done.

55:09.305 --> 55:10.224
We're gonna miss you!

55:10.266 --> 55:11.391
- Bye!
- Good luck!

55:11.433 --> 55:12.810
Swim fast, Isla.

55:12.851 --> 55:13.978
You can do this!

55:14.019 --> 55:15.229
Goodbye.

55:24.404 --> 55:25.823
Huh?

55:26.907 --> 55:28.242
A mermaid?

55:28.284 --> 55:29.576
Is that for real?

55:29.618 --> 55:31.578
But I-I thought
they didn't exist.

55:31.620 --> 55:32.788
Forget the dolphins, Hugo.

55:32.830 --> 55:35.124
I want that mermaid.

55:35.166 --> 55:36.000
You got it.

55:37.251 --> 55:38.376
Scatter!

55:46.010 --> 55:47.845
Oh no, they're after Isla now.

55:59.064 --> 56:00.398
I need to help her.

56:10.784 --> 56:12.577
Where'd she go?

56:12.619 --> 56:13.787
There she is!

56:13.829 --> 56:16.498
We've got her now.

56:16.540 --> 56:18.458
Is your net-launcher
ready, Hugo?

56:18.500 --> 56:19.668
Primed and ready.

56:19.710 --> 56:21.045
Perfect.

56:23.421 --> 56:27.551
I've got little miss mermaid
right in my sight!

56:35.976 --> 56:38.979
Yes, I got her!

56:39.813 --> 56:41.190
- No!
- Oh no!

56:53.327 --> 56:57.497
I hope you know you're going
to make me a lot of money.

57:00.334 --> 57:02.211
Oh, hi, Marlo.

57:02.253 --> 57:03.087
What?

57:03.128 --> 57:04.504
This... this can't be!

57:04.546 --> 57:05.923
I hate to break it to you,

57:05.964 --> 57:08.508
but I don't think anyone
will pay to see me as a mermaid.

57:08.550 --> 57:10.468
There was a real mermaid.

57:10.510 --> 57:11.595
I saw it.

57:11.636 --> 57:12.930
You saw it, too.
Right, Hugo?

57:12.971 --> 57:13.847
Right?

57:13.889 --> 57:16.016
I'm not sure what I saw.

57:16.058 --> 57:18.643
But what I do know is that
I came out here for nothing!

57:18.685 --> 57:20.687
Good riddance, Marlo.

57:22.273 --> 57:23.774
Oh, don't worry, Marlo.

57:23.815 --> 57:25.150
I'm sure you'll find a new career

57:25.192 --> 57:26.526
after they take away your research center.

57:26.568 --> 57:30.197
A real marine biologist
wants to help animals,

57:30.239 --> 57:32.283
not just use them to get rich.

57:32.324 --> 57:33.491
No!

57:39.748 --> 57:41.583
Hey, there's Isla!

57:41.625 --> 57:43.335
Whoo-woo, you made it!

57:43.377 --> 57:44.586
Goodbye, Isla!

57:44.628 --> 57:45.796
Goodbye!

57:45.837 --> 57:48.006
I'll never forget you!

57:58.558 --> 57:59.476
Thanks!

58:04.231 --> 58:05.399
Nice work, Chels.

58:05.441 --> 58:06.817
Don't forget this.

58:06.858 --> 58:10.570
Castle Malibu, fit for a queen.

58:10.612 --> 58:12.739
She'd better be tiny!

58:12.781 --> 58:14.532
Whoo-hoo!
Coming through!

58:16.034 --> 58:17.911
Awesome!

58:17.953 --> 58:19.288
Hey, Barbie,

58:19.330 --> 58:21.665
my photo blog won first place.

58:21.706 --> 58:23.208
That's great, Skip.

58:23.250 --> 58:25.085
Did you submit all the photos from our trip?

58:25.127 --> 58:26.795
All but this one.

58:26.837 --> 58:28.546
It's not our secret to tell.

58:29.756 --> 58:31.300
And besides,

58:31.342 --> 58:34.219
this is the best shot of the trip.

58:34.261 --> 58:36.763
It sure is.

58:36.805 --> 58:39.641
I wonder how Isla is doing.

58:39.683 --> 58:42.478
You should go and try that shell again.

58:43.395 --> 58:44.271
Yeah.

58:44.313 --> 58:45.856
You never know.

59:09.129 --> 59:11.507
Maybe someday.

59:14.259 --> 59:16.011
I miss you, Isla.

59:16.053 --> 59:19.890
Then it's a good thing
I followed that current.

59:19.931 --> 59:21.308
Isla!

59:21.350 --> 59:22.434
You found us!

59:23.477 --> 59:25.103
Well, I probably wouldn't have

59:25.145 --> 59:26.897
if you didn't keep trying.

59:26.938 --> 59:29.983
But every time you did,
I was able to get closer.

59:30.025 --> 59:31.860
Thanks for not giving up on me.

59:31.902 --> 59:34.654
I would never give up
on my sister of the sea.

59:35.447 --> 59:36.448
Hey, it's Isla!

59:36.490 --> 59:37.408
- Awesome!
- We missed you!

59:40.244 --> 59:41.578
Hi again!

59:42.620 --> 59:43.621
Look!

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:13.693
♪ Oh-oh... oh-oh ♪

01:00:13.735 --> 01:00:15.153
♪ Uh-huh ♪

01:00:15.195 --> 01:00:16.238
♪ Oh-oh ♪

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.489
♪ Whoo! ♪

01:00:17.531 --> 01:00:18.490
♪ Oh-oh-oh ♪

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:21.243
This is going to be so good!
