WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:03.204
JIMMY:
I'm not sure she's ready
for her first sleepover.

00:03.237 --> 00:05.339
Maybe I should cancel
my bachelor party.

00:05.373 --> 00:07.308
No, then I'll feel guilty about
having my bachelorette party,

00:07.341 --> 00:09.377
and I won't be able
to enjoy watching a...

00:09.410 --> 00:11.345
very muscular half-man,
half-tripod

00:11.379 --> 00:13.081
gyrate in my no-fly zone.

00:13.114 --> 00:15.216
Well, there is not
going to be any of that

00:15.249 --> 00:16.750
happening at my party.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.652
We're just gonna be
hanging out, playing Mad Libs,

00:18.686 --> 00:21.055
see what it's like to play beer
pong sober-- never done that.

00:21.089 --> 00:23.524
And then, after a while,
if we're still going strong,
maybe we'll check out

00:23.557 --> 00:25.159
Jay Leno's take
on the day's events.

00:25.193 --> 00:27.195
Oh, come on.
Don't make me do this alone.

00:27.228 --> 00:30.698
When we compare notes,
we should both feel shameful.

00:30.731 --> 00:34.268
No, I mean...
the last time I went wild,
I knocked up a serial killer.

00:34.302 --> 00:36.770
In fact, every time I've gotten
wild, I've made bad decisions.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.406
In high school,
I became a Goth freak

00:38.439 --> 00:39.773
and I pierced my wang-doodle.

00:39.807 --> 00:41.209
That explains
the whistling noise

00:41.242 --> 00:42.743
when we were getting frisky
the other night.

00:42.776 --> 00:43.777
You know, I thought somebody
put on the teakettle.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.413
Nope.

00:45.446 --> 00:48.482
I've got a tiny, whistling
hole in my wang-doodle.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.227
What's that?

00:59.260 --> 01:01.295
Uh, nothing. Just some...

01:01.329 --> 01:04.432
boring girl stuff I bought
for the bachelorette party.

01:04.465 --> 01:08.302
So boring you had to hide it
in the vegetable crisper?

01:08.336 --> 01:10.238
(sighs)

01:10.271 --> 01:12.140
Okay, fine.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.208
It's a bag of penises.

01:14.242 --> 01:17.245
Whose are they, and why do they
have to be kept crisp?

01:17.278 --> 01:19.547
I went to the novelty store to
pick up some things for tonight,

01:19.580 --> 01:21.549
and I couldn't
stop myself!

01:21.582 --> 01:23.717
They had penis hats,
glasses, socks.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.286
But not all of it
was dirty stuff.

01:25.319 --> 01:26.654
They also had
these salt and pepper shakers

01:26.687 --> 01:29.257
that were shaped
like little mushrooms.

01:29.290 --> 01:32.826
No. Wait.
I just realized something.

01:32.860 --> 01:36.564
Ooh, I see you got some
vagina-shaped pasta.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.766
No, those are just shells.
I stopped by Howdy's.

01:40.234 --> 01:41.635
That is not fair.

01:41.669 --> 01:43.137
You're gonna have a crazy night
with the girls,

01:43.171 --> 01:44.438
and for my first bachelor party,

01:44.472 --> 01:46.174
I don't know exactly
what's gonna happen,

01:46.207 --> 01:47.841
but I've heard
the words "mocktails"

01:47.875 --> 01:49.510
and "jigsaw puzzles,"
so I don't have a good feeling.

01:49.543 --> 01:52.246
You should be proud
that your son isn't a pervert.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.315
I mean, we might have made
some mistakes here and there,

01:54.348 --> 01:57.418
but we were obviously classy
parents who made a good example.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.519
(oven timer buzzes)
Ooh!

01:58.552 --> 02:00.288
My boner scones are ready.

02:01.389 --> 02:02.823
Whoo!

02:02.856 --> 02:04.792
* Here we go

02:04.825 --> 02:08.162
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

02:08.196 --> 02:10.764
Okay. That's the last word.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.433
So the story is,

02:12.466 --> 02:14.502
"I was 'bored'

02:14.535 --> 02:17.505
"in my 'bored' hat
and went to my...

02:17.538 --> 02:18.872
"'boring' room, where I saw

02:18.906 --> 02:20.341
"a 'bored'
that was eating my

02:20.374 --> 02:22.176
giant 'this sucks.'"

02:22.210 --> 02:23.211
I don't think
that even makes sense.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.212
(knocking)

02:24.245 --> 02:25.246
(groans)

02:25.279 --> 02:26.514
(mumbles)

02:26.547 --> 02:27.681
Oh, hi, Tyler.

02:27.715 --> 02:29.250
Hey, I think you got
the wrong house.

02:29.283 --> 02:30.184
We didn't order
any pizzas tonight.

02:30.218 --> 02:31.552
I'm not here
on pizza business.

02:31.585 --> 02:32.820
I'm a videographer.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.522
That's why I brought
my assistants,

02:34.555 --> 02:36.290
my son and his friend,

02:36.324 --> 02:38.392
who was unfortunate enough
to be sleeping over tonight.

02:38.426 --> 02:40.461
The pizzas
are our dinner

02:40.494 --> 02:42.196
since the gentleman
who hired us

02:42.230 --> 02:43.797
refused to provide food.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.933
It's a job, man, not a buffet.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.303
Frank, this doesn't
need to be recorded.

02:49.337 --> 02:51.239
You could say that
about every single

02:51.272 --> 02:53.341
Matthew McConaughey movie
ever made,

02:53.374 --> 02:56.710
but that didn't stop Hollywood,
and it won't stop us.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.250
You're all going down.

03:02.283 --> 03:04.218
Though I guess that is kind
of the point of the game.

03:04.252 --> 03:05.753
Bitches, you don't stand
a chance.

03:05.786 --> 03:08.222
I have low self-esteem
and I'm hungry.

03:08.256 --> 03:11.225
I haven't paid
a speeding ticket since 1962.

03:11.259 --> 03:13.327
You're about to see why.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.362
Okay. On the count of three.

03:14.395 --> 03:15.363
One,

03:15.396 --> 03:16.430
two...

03:16.464 --> 03:17.431
(doorbell rings)

03:17.465 --> 03:19.233
Stripper time!

03:20.268 --> 03:22.270
Somebody order a pizza?

03:22.303 --> 03:23.971
Sabrina, we didn't
order a...

03:27.408 --> 03:28.442
...a stripper.

03:28.476 --> 03:30.278
That's a real pizza guy.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.912
Please don't judge.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.814
I get free pizza
and I sit in a car all night.

03:37.585 --> 03:41.389
Oh! Ah. I found
the corner piece.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.956
BURT: This is
a bachelor party.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.692
I want to go in the bathroom
and find a tiger.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.394
I want to get punched
in the face by Mike Tyson.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.396
I want to wake up on the roof
of a Las Vegas hotel.

03:48.429 --> 03:51.265
Like that movie The Hangover.
Didn't see it.

03:51.299 --> 03:53.434
This is a low-key night--
we're not gonna have
that kind of party.

03:53.467 --> 03:54.802
You can turn
the cameras off.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.405
Nothing crazy
is gonna happen.

03:59.473 --> 04:00.874
(knocking)

04:00.908 --> 04:02.910
Are you open?

04:04.378 --> 04:05.713
(knocking)

04:05.746 --> 04:07.415
Anyone there?

04:07.448 --> 04:09.750
Are you open?

04:09.783 --> 04:12.052
Hello?

04:12.085 --> 04:14.988
It's an emergency.

04:15.022 --> 04:18.426
I can't eat my oatmeal
without raisins!

04:18.459 --> 04:20.461
(sobs)

04:20.494 --> 04:23.497
What the hell happened?

04:26.867 --> 04:27.935
(bleating)

04:27.968 --> 04:29.337
'Sup?

04:29.370 --> 04:31.539
(chittering)

04:38.379 --> 04:40.381
Oh, jeez.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.418
Oh, boy.

04:47.821 --> 04:50.358
Oh, God.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.604
Top of the mornin'.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.473
Last night was wild.

05:05.506 --> 05:08.409
I'm not sure who remembers what,
but don't worry,

05:08.442 --> 05:10.811
Tyler and the kids
captured the whole thing.

05:10.844 --> 05:14.047
They're editing it as we speak.

05:14.081 --> 05:16.517
'Sup, drunk white people.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.118
You can turn the cameras off.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.920
Nothing crazy
is gonna happen.

05:22.590 --> 05:24.525
It's go time.

05:24.558 --> 05:28.028
MEN (chanting):
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!
Jimmy! Jimmy!

05:28.061 --> 05:29.863
What in tarnation?

05:29.897 --> 05:33.066
(chanting):
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!
Jimmy! Jimmy!

05:33.100 --> 05:36.570
Say hello to the boys
of Omicron Delta Sigma,

05:36.604 --> 05:38.038
the hardest partying fraternity

05:38.071 --> 05:40.408
Natesville Vocational School
has to offer.

05:40.441 --> 05:41.742
(barking)

05:41.775 --> 05:43.511
FRANK:
I invited them to help

05:43.544 --> 05:45.078
give you the best night
of your life.

05:45.112 --> 05:47.147
Frat guys? Kegs of beer?

05:47.180 --> 05:49.550
And a free slice of pizza
from two generous young...

05:49.583 --> 05:50.984
Ow. I'll eat chips.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.920
But it's still gonna be
a great night!

05:52.953 --> 05:55.989
Frank, I said I didn't want
a big party!

05:56.023 --> 05:57.725
I heard your words,

05:57.758 --> 06:00.528
but as your BFF--
best friend Frank--

06:00.561 --> 06:02.496
I also heard your thoughts.

06:02.530 --> 06:03.897
Frank!

06:03.931 --> 06:05.499
Stop it! Stop it!

06:05.533 --> 06:06.700
(grunting)

06:06.734 --> 06:10.103
(men barking)
(Jimmy shouting)

06:10.137 --> 06:12.440
* It's time to get
the party started *

06:12.473 --> 06:14.775
* It don't take much
for me to Mardi Gras it *

06:14.808 --> 06:15.909
* And I'm fly regardless

06:15.943 --> 06:17.611
Barney Hughes,

06:17.645 --> 06:20.781
requesting permission
to re-pledge.
Re-pledge?

06:20.814 --> 06:22.182
22 years ago I pledged
your fraternity

06:22.215 --> 06:24.017
when I was at Natesville State.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.620
I made it all the way to when
I had to swallow the goldfish.

06:26.654 --> 06:29.590
But I chewed.
I chewed.

06:29.623 --> 06:32.593
Gross, dude.
Animal cruelty isn't cool.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.795
But if you want the honor
of calling yourself an O-Delt,

06:34.828 --> 06:36.396
just run full-speed
into that tree.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.571
(grunts)

06:43.604 --> 06:45.573
(men groan over video)

06:45.606 --> 06:47.608
Porno! Porno! Porno!

06:47.641 --> 06:48.909
JIMMY:
Whoa! Frank,

06:48.942 --> 06:50.978
we can't watch porn
back here, all right?

06:51.011 --> 06:52.580
Neighbors can see it.

06:52.613 --> 06:53.914
Then they'll get
ideas and come over.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.583
With wine coolers.

06:55.616 --> 06:58.085
Remind me to tell
you that story.
It's not porn.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.220
Aw!
FRANK: Look,
it's no secret

07:00.253 --> 07:01.922
your fiancée
and I don't get along.

07:01.955 --> 07:03.123
So I just want
to make sure

07:03.156 --> 07:04.992
you have a clear picture

07:05.025 --> 07:08.028
of the woman
you're going to call your wife.

07:10.598 --> 07:12.065
(men groan)

07:12.099 --> 07:14.101
Deal-breaker!

07:16.537 --> 07:18.739
(high-pitched flatulence)

07:18.772 --> 07:20.073
MEN (chanting):
Girls don't fart!
Girls don't fart!

07:20.107 --> 07:21.742
FRANK:
You think that's
(chuckles)

07:21.775 --> 07:23.243
disgusting, check out

07:23.276 --> 07:25.813
what she's gonna look like
in 30 years.

07:27.214 --> 07:29.182
(men groan)

07:29.216 --> 07:31.685
FRANK: For lack of a
stronger vocabulary,

07:31.719 --> 07:33.654
she looks like human diarrhea.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.956
JIMMY:
What can I say, Frank?

07:35.989 --> 07:38.025
I'm in love.

07:40.227 --> 07:43.030
All right, looks like
he still wants to do it.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.798
On to phase two.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.767
I was hoping you would change
your mind about this

07:46.800 --> 07:48.502
stupid marriage
if we caught Sabrina

07:48.536 --> 07:49.870
cheating on you,
but unfortunately,

07:49.903 --> 07:51.705
her party was pretty lame.

07:51.739 --> 07:53.741
*

07:54.975 --> 07:57.978
Honey! He's home!

08:03.617 --> 08:04.852
(muffled shouting)

08:04.885 --> 08:07.187
Are you okay?

08:07.220 --> 08:10.591
Oh, my God, did that hurt!

08:10.624 --> 08:13.527
*

08:13.561 --> 08:15.896
Why does your stripper
look like Brian,

08:15.929 --> 08:18.666
the chubby kid I went
to high school with?

08:18.699 --> 08:20.568
Hey. Jimmy Chance.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.235
Long time.
(chuckles)

08:22.269 --> 08:23.971
Quit staring, Jimmy!

08:24.004 --> 08:25.939
You're making
this awkward!

08:27.074 --> 08:29.677
Ah. Aw, keg's dead!

08:29.710 --> 08:30.611
(all groan)

08:30.644 --> 08:33.614
Where we gonna get beer
this time of night?

08:33.647 --> 08:35.583
I have keys to a grocery store!

08:35.616 --> 08:37.685
(all cheer)

08:37.718 --> 08:40.721
MEN (chanting):
Old pledge! Old pledge!
Old pledge! Old pledge!

08:40.754 --> 08:43.891
Old pledge! Old pledge!
Old pledge!

08:46.760 --> 08:48.228
It's all for us!

08:48.261 --> 08:50.297
Take it all!

08:53.634 --> 08:55.669
Whoo!

08:57.905 --> 08:59.673
(bleating)

09:02.776 --> 09:05.579
(chuckling)

09:14.688 --> 09:16.556
(chittering)

09:17.758 --> 09:19.660
Whoo-hoo!

09:19.693 --> 09:21.261
Yeah!
(men cheer)

09:21.294 --> 09:22.596
FRANK:
Everyone was having
a good time,

09:22.630 --> 09:23.897
but I had a job to do.

09:23.931 --> 09:26.099
Pull!

09:26.133 --> 09:28.602
Since none of my plans
to stop this wedding

09:28.636 --> 09:31.605
were working,
I had to go to my last resort.

09:31.639 --> 09:33.607
Check this out.
Mmm.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.776
My sister's old
wedding dress.
(chuckles)

09:35.809 --> 09:37.277
We should have a fake wedding.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.378
It'll be hilarious.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.614
To the happy couple!

09:42.149 --> 09:44.184
(groans)

09:50.023 --> 09:52.092
(all cheering)

09:54.962 --> 09:58.999
Frank, do you take Jimmy to be
your lawfully wedded partner?

09:59.032 --> 10:01.101
I do.
(chuckles)

10:01.134 --> 10:02.803
DANCIN' DAN:
And, Jimmy,

10:02.836 --> 10:05.172
do you take Frank to be
your lawfully wedded partner?

10:05.205 --> 10:06.840
I do.

10:06.874 --> 10:08.642
I always imagined
this would happen in Vegas

10:08.676 --> 10:10.778
in a little wedding chapel
while we're being chased

10:10.811 --> 10:12.112
by this little Asian guy.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.647
You mean like
in The Hangover?

10:13.681 --> 10:16.183
Has everyone seen
this movie except me?

10:16.216 --> 10:19.753
I now pronounce you
husbands for life.

10:19.787 --> 10:20.854
Whoo!
(all cheering)

10:23.156 --> 10:25.425
MEN:
Married! Married!

10:25.458 --> 10:27.427
Married! Married! Married!

10:27.460 --> 10:29.162
FRANK:
And in case you're wondering
if it's legal,

10:29.196 --> 10:31.665
here's our marriage license.

10:31.699 --> 10:33.366
Hey, Jimmy.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.936
The egg delivery guy is here,
and I can't find Barney.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.705
Will you sign for them?
Yeah.

10:40.741 --> 10:44.377
We're gonna need a witness to
prove Jimmy signed for the eggs.

10:44.411 --> 10:45.779
Yeah.

10:45.813 --> 10:48.281
So... sorry, Sabrina.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.718
You can't marry Jimmy anymore

10:50.751 --> 10:52.753
because he's already taken.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.689
(laughs)

11:01.394 --> 11:03.864
(grunting)

11:03.897 --> 11:07.034
Open the damn door,
you little freak!

11:08.068 --> 11:11.371
Oh, the ex.

11:11.404 --> 11:12.773
This is uncomfortable.

11:13.841 --> 11:16.043
You listen to me.
Oh, my God.

11:16.076 --> 11:18.178
(sighs)

11:18.211 --> 11:19.379
I forgot.
You have this whole weird town

11:19.412 --> 11:21.348
and all those creepy dolls.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.383
They're not dolls.
They're action figures.

11:23.416 --> 11:24.985
You better fix this, Frank,

11:25.018 --> 11:27.187
because you are not
messing up my wedding!

11:27.220 --> 11:30.157
I'm sorry, but if I let you guys
get married,

11:30.190 --> 11:32.893
it'll mess up the plans
I made for Jimmy and I.

11:32.926 --> 11:36.696
I mapped out a whole
future for us. Look.

11:40.834 --> 11:44.071
First, I thought
we could learn how to surf

11:44.104 --> 11:46.907
and show off our ripped bods
to the chicks at the beach.

11:46.940 --> 11:49.076
Then, with your artistic talent

11:49.109 --> 11:51.779
and my love
of frigid temperatures,

11:51.812 --> 11:54.948
I thought we could become
professional ice sculptors.

11:54.982 --> 11:57.818
Then, in the off-season,
figured we could go to Spain

11:57.851 --> 12:00.120
and run with the bulls.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.957
Just because Jimmy and I
are getting married

12:03.991 --> 12:06.393
doesn't mean you guys can't
do all that cool stuff together.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.261
Seriously?

12:08.295 --> 12:10.363
Awesome.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.800
I've got a lot of
other ideas, too.

12:12.833 --> 12:15.268
I'll be right back.

12:15.302 --> 12:16.904
(quietly):
What are you doing?

12:16.937 --> 12:18.371
I don't want
to go surfing with Frank.

12:18.405 --> 12:21.074
I'm afraid of sharks
and jellyfish and sea lions.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.810
I don't think sea lions
are what you think they are.

12:22.843 --> 12:23.944
They're the kings
of the ocean, right?

12:23.977 --> 12:25.412
No, not really.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.915
Look, we are dealing
with a mental patient here.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.917
We just have to tell him
exactly what he wants to hear,

12:29.950 --> 12:31.218
and then he'll give you
the divorce,

12:31.251 --> 12:32.820
and then we can go get married.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.088
FRANK: We are going
to have so much fun.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.991
How familiar are you

12:38.025 --> 12:41.829
with the game I just invented
called unicycle lacrosse?

12:41.862 --> 12:44.097
Yeah.

12:44.131 --> 12:46.867
Listen, I'm at
a client's house.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.936
I can't discuss this
right now.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.872
Well, I don't think you should
wear a bow tie to the meeting.

12:52.906 --> 12:54.842
Sorry about that.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.509
Trouble with another client.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.946
Sorry I'm late.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.014
I was having trouble
with my lawyer.

13:01.048 --> 13:03.583
Wait. You're
representing him, too?

13:03.616 --> 13:07.187
Oh, I'm afraid that's
attorney-client privilege.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.822
But since
you're also my client,

13:08.856 --> 13:11.491
I think I can say yes.

13:11.524 --> 13:13.160
An unusual tactic.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.028
I want to see where this goes.

13:15.062 --> 13:16.496
But be warned, counselor.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.365
You're on a short leash.

13:18.398 --> 13:19.532
(whispering):
Law and Order.

13:19.566 --> 13:20.500
WALLY:
Okay.

13:20.533 --> 13:21.969
Before my client

13:22.002 --> 13:23.837
signs these divorce papers,

13:23.871 --> 13:26.840
he's requested that you sign
a postnuptial agreement.

13:26.874 --> 13:30.878
Which my client has full right
to refuse to sign.

13:30.911 --> 13:33.413
You'll sign, or we'll
see you in court.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.150
"I, Jimmy Chance,

13:37.184 --> 13:39.452
"promise to build birdhouses
with Frank Marolla,

13:39.486 --> 13:42.389
"go on a hot air balloon ride,

13:42.422 --> 13:44.524
"do monthly mole check.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.559
"If I should fail
to fulfill these duties,

13:46.593 --> 13:48.628
"I hereby relinquish the rights
to my van

13:48.661 --> 13:50.563
"and custody of my daughter,
what's-her-name,

13:50.597 --> 13:52.399
"who will then
be raised by Frank

13:52.432 --> 13:53.500
"and immediately renamed

13:53.533 --> 13:55.168
She-Frank."

13:55.202 --> 13:56.403
I'm not signing it.

13:56.436 --> 13:58.405
Well, why not?

13:58.438 --> 14:01.208
It's just all the things
you promised we'd do together.

14:01.241 --> 14:03.977
Because I don't want
to do any of that stuff, Frank.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.980
I just want to marry the girl
I love, and if you were

14:07.014 --> 14:08.882
a real friend,
you'd understand that.

14:08.916 --> 14:09.816
Great point, Jimmy.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.920
Frank, how could you let him
say that to you?

14:12.953 --> 14:15.088
I knew this was a mistake.

14:15.122 --> 14:17.590
Never should have agreed
to this stupid meeting.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.130
This is far from over!

14:26.233 --> 14:30.003
I think we're in
pretty good shape.
This is crazy.

14:30.037 --> 14:32.339
Right? I've got to be able
to get a divorce without him.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.275
You get him to sign it,
and it'll be quick and easy.

14:35.308 --> 14:38.178
But if not, and his lawyer
gets wind of this,

14:38.211 --> 14:40.180
which he just did,

14:40.213 --> 14:42.449
then they can really
drag this out.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.117
Which I fully intend to do.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.585
What if someone cuts Frank's
brake lines

14:45.618 --> 14:46.920
and he died
in a fiery car crash?

14:46.954 --> 14:48.255
I'm spit-balling here.

14:48.288 --> 14:49.990
If anybody's got
a better idea

14:50.023 --> 14:51.124
how to kill Frank
and get away with it,

14:51.158 --> 14:52.225
the floor is yours.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.593
Wait a minute.

14:53.626 --> 14:54.995
If he wants
to be married to Jimmy,

14:55.028 --> 14:56.463
maybe we should see

14:56.496 --> 14:58.231
if he really wants
to be married to Jimmy.

14:58.265 --> 15:00.000
That's a great idea.

15:00.033 --> 15:02.469
Jimmy should pressure him
for sex constantly.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.637
He'll enjoy it
for the first couple of months,

15:04.671 --> 15:06.573
but eventually,
it'll just turn into a chore.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.141
VIRGINIA: No,
I'm not saying they should

15:08.175 --> 15:09.642
conjugate the marriage, Burt.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.079
I just think
Frank should see

15:12.112 --> 15:14.147
what it's really like spending
all his time with Jimmy.

15:14.181 --> 15:16.049
(phone ringing)

15:16.083 --> 15:17.050
Wally Phipps.

15:17.084 --> 15:20.120
Oh. You were brilliant,

15:20.153 --> 15:22.155
and that bow tie
did look great.

15:22.189 --> 15:23.957
(laughs)

15:23.991 --> 15:27.394
Oh, those Chances don't
have a chance of winning.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.229
Yeah.

15:29.262 --> 15:32.132
I don't have a fancy pun
for "Frank,"

15:32.165 --> 15:34.001
but we're gonna destroy him.

15:34.034 --> 15:36.069
Oh, wait.

15:36.103 --> 15:37.737
I'm speaking to you frankly.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.072
(laughs)

15:39.106 --> 15:41.008
Nailed it.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.147
All right, Frank thinks

15:47.180 --> 15:48.748
spending all his time
with Jimmy would be great.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.484
But what he doesn't know is what
a pain in the ass you are.

15:51.518 --> 15:54.021
- What are you talking about?
- You've got some annoying
habits.

15:54.054 --> 15:56.189
Like when you sing
in the shower.

15:56.223 --> 15:59.359
JIMMY (off-key):
* I've been working
on the railroad *

15:59.392 --> 16:02.195
* All the livelong day

16:02.229 --> 16:05.198
* I've been working
on the railroad *

16:05.232 --> 16:07.134
* Just to pass the time...
(toilet flushing)

16:07.167 --> 16:08.368
(screaming)

16:08.401 --> 16:09.302
SABRINA:
And when you're irritated,

16:09.336 --> 16:11.471
you do a play-by-play
of your every move.

16:11.504 --> 16:14.674
Oh, great, you ate
the last of the cookies.

16:14.707 --> 16:17.277
Now I've got
to pick up the plate,

16:17.310 --> 16:20.380
walk back
to the kitchen,

16:20.413 --> 16:22.049
put the plate
in the sink.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.383
(glass breaking)

16:23.416 --> 16:25.518
Pick up the broken pieces.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.054
Ah, God!

16:27.087 --> 16:29.189
Cut my finger.

16:29.222 --> 16:31.291
Now I've got to look
for a Band-Aid.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.360
And, of course,
there are none in the drawer.

16:33.393 --> 16:35.728
But I found
some cookies.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.331
Walking back
into the living room.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.702
And I'm sitting
back down.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.305
Only to see you drank
the last of the milk.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.806
Getting up again...

16:46.839 --> 16:47.674
BURT:
It drives me crazy

16:47.707 --> 16:50.277
when you only drink half
of every soda.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.414
Jimmy!

16:54.447 --> 16:57.050
Without the bubbles,
my tongue gets the flavor,

16:57.084 --> 16:58.551
but my nose doesn't get
the tickle.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.353
Puts my whole face out of whack.

17:00.387 --> 17:03.356
I mean, these are all
just bad habits.

17:03.390 --> 17:06.226
I mean, look, somebody could
have just said something.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.560
That's annoying, too.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.062
How you always make everything
our fault.

17:09.096 --> 17:10.097
Totally.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.498
Oh, yeah.

17:11.531 --> 17:14.167
All right, fine.
I'm annoying.

17:14.201 --> 17:15.702
I'll just go
and get Frank

17:15.735 --> 17:18.171
to divorce me
by being myself.

17:18.205 --> 17:19.406
And I'm headed to the door.

17:19.439 --> 17:20.740
I'm grabbing
my jacket.

17:20.773 --> 17:22.175
Ugh!

17:22.209 --> 17:24.111
Looking for
my shoes.
Ugh.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.345
Looking...

17:25.378 --> 17:27.147
The first thing I had to do

17:27.180 --> 17:28.515
was go to Frank's
and make him believe

17:28.548 --> 17:30.250
I was really moving in.

17:30.283 --> 17:31.684
Jimmy?
(loudly):
Okay.

17:31.718 --> 17:35.155
Fine. You know what?! It's over!

17:35.188 --> 17:38.091
Whoa. What happened there?

17:38.125 --> 17:40.427
What can I say, Frank?
Bitches.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.695
Does your offer still stand
to live here?

17:42.729 --> 17:44.264
Are you kidding?

17:44.297 --> 17:46.233
Our monogrammed towels
got here this morning.

17:46.266 --> 17:50.237
Of course it still stands.
Make yourself at home, hubby.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.772
JIMMY:
First, I tried annoying him
in the bathroom.

17:52.805 --> 17:55.808
JIMMY (off-key):
* Someone's in the kitchen,
I know *

17:55.842 --> 17:58.411
* Someone's in the kitchen
with Dinah *

17:58.445 --> 18:00.813
* Strummin' the old banjo

18:00.847 --> 18:03.216
FRANK:
* Fee, fie,
fiddly-i-ay *

18:03.250 --> 18:06.119
* Fee, fie,
fiddly-i-o *

18:06.153 --> 18:08.421
* Fee, fie, fiddly-i-ay

18:08.455 --> 18:10.790
* Strummin' on the old banjo.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.594
JIMMY:
Then I tried annoying him
in the kitchen.

18:14.627 --> 18:18.131
Awesome. I always said the
problem with soda is that

18:18.165 --> 18:21.168
it's too bubbly, and there's
too much of it in each can.

18:21.201 --> 18:24.271
JIMMY:
Some things I didn't even
get a chance to try.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.805
What are you doing in there?

18:25.838 --> 18:27.140
JIMMY:
I'm looking
for a glass.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.441
What about now?

18:28.475 --> 18:30.610
Rinsing the
glass out.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.145
And now?

18:32.179 --> 18:33.480
Still rinsing.

18:33.513 --> 18:34.647
Gonna be a couple minutes.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.849
You want some company?

18:36.883 --> 18:40.187
JIMMY:
Turns out Frank was so happy
to have someone in his life,

18:40.220 --> 18:42.222
he didn't care what I did.

18:42.255 --> 18:44.191
And that actually made being
married to him kind of fun.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.226
(knocking)
BURT:
Psst! Jimmy!

18:48.228 --> 18:50.530
It's been three days.
What's the holdup?

18:50.563 --> 18:52.299
Leave me alone.
All right, I'm working on it.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.334
Work faster. We got sick
of explaining where you were,

18:54.367 --> 18:55.835
so we told Hope
you were mad at her.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.304
The longer
this goes on,

18:57.337 --> 18:58.671
the worse that decision looks.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.707
Maybe it's time
to tell Frank to take a drive.

19:00.740 --> 19:04.677
You know, down a long road,
by a steep cliff.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.713
What? I'm just kidding.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.781
What? I didn't cut
his brake lines.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.351
FRANK:
Jimmy, your sardines are ready.

19:11.384 --> 19:12.285
I'll be right there!

19:12.319 --> 19:14.187
Busting out the big guns, huh?

19:14.221 --> 19:15.188
I forgot how you like
to eat those stinky sardines.

19:15.222 --> 19:16.623
He's gonna hate that.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.226
Yeah, he does hate it,
but you know what?

19:19.259 --> 19:21.661
He doesn't secretly judge me
for my annoying habits
like the rest of you.

19:21.694 --> 19:23.696
He loves me for who I am.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.298
There's no way
he loves you, Jimmy.

19:25.332 --> 19:26.699
You're going to wind up living

19:26.733 --> 19:28.668
in a cage in the basement,
I feel it.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.403
Frank is a wonderful person.

19:30.437 --> 19:33.273
He doesn't yell at me for
leaving my towel on the floor,

19:33.306 --> 19:34.674
or complain
that I'm a horrible singer.

19:34.707 --> 19:38.245
No. He harmonizes and brings me
on-key.

19:38.278 --> 19:40.213
And if that isn't a metaphor,
I don't know what is.

19:40.247 --> 19:42.215
I'm serious. I don't know
what a metaphor is.

19:42.249 --> 19:44.251
Frank wouldn't judge me
for that.

19:44.284 --> 19:46.219
(sighs)

19:46.253 --> 19:48.288
Jimmy,

19:48.321 --> 19:51.324
I just wanted to say
that these last few days

19:51.358 --> 19:54.294
have been better
than I could have ever imagined.

19:54.327 --> 19:56.329
(sighs)

19:56.363 --> 19:58.331
I've never really had
a relationship before,

19:58.365 --> 20:01.701
and every moment with you
has been a revelation.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.670
I know exactly
how you feel.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.239
I've never felt so
accepted for who I am.

20:06.273 --> 20:08.408
Me, neither.
Mmm.

20:08.441 --> 20:11.010
(sighs)
But here's the thing.

20:11.043 --> 20:14.013
I think I might rather
try it with a girl.
A girl?

20:14.046 --> 20:16.583
Yeah, you know,
for the sex part.

20:16.616 --> 20:20.620
So, you're breaking up
with me? Just like that?

20:20.653 --> 20:23.290
But there's so much stuff
that I wanted us to do together.

20:23.323 --> 20:24.791
Well, we can still
be friends, Jimmy.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.626
It's not like
we'll never see each other.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.561
We'll always have Howdy's.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.564
Let me drive you home.

20:31.598 --> 20:34.367
Whoa! Frank, no!
Um, let's walk.

20:34.401 --> 20:37.304
I mean, it's beautiful out.

20:37.337 --> 20:39.539
Sabrina cut my brakes,
didn't she?

20:39.572 --> 20:40.573
Yeah, probably.

20:42.409 --> 20:45.445
That's a damn fine woman
you got there, Jimmy.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.480
Damn fine.

20:47.514 --> 20:49.316
JIMMY:
So, the next day,

20:49.349 --> 20:51.584
Frank and I called Wally
and got a divorce.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.653
But not before
I added a post-nup

20:53.686 --> 20:55.755
to make sure
we'd always stay friends.

20:57.524 --> 21:00.993
I now pronounce you
ex-husband and ex-wife.

21:01.027 --> 21:03.496
You may now kiss
your fiancée.

21:06.399 --> 21:09.001
When I finally
find the one,

21:09.035 --> 21:11.438
I hope you'll at least
consider swapping.

21:15.342 --> 21:17.344
Adios, amigos!
