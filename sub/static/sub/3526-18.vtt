01:47.166 --> 01:48.968
Whoa whoa
whoa whoa!

01:51.371 --> 01:53.072
Stop dumping.
Stop dumping.

01:53.206 --> 01:55.675
- What is matter?
- Lower your bed.

01:55.708 --> 01:58.411
You can't dump here no more.
You need to talk to your boss.

01:58.478 --> 02:00.279
Always we are
dumping here.

02:00.380 --> 02:02.215
Caballero, put the shit
back in your truck.

02:02.281 --> 02:05.018
What?
That is huge job!

02:12.158 --> 02:13.893
Where I am supposed
to be dumping this now?

02:29.409 --> 02:33.246
I just now find out it's asbestos
you've been dumping over there.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.380
What did you
think it was?

02:36.481 --> 02:38.158
I never asked.

02:38.214 --> 02:40.521
<i>Tampax-- What the
fuck do I know?</i>

02:40.659 --> 02:42.150
Well, now you know.

02:42.229 --> 02:44.251
You and your friend there stefano
have been pocketing how much

02:44.357 --> 02:47.420
On this cowboys-And-Indian
asbestos removal?

02:47.565 --> 02:48.920
Billing the townships

02:49.027 --> 02:52.092
Like you're following
althe epa regulations.

02:52.236 --> 02:54.563
You got the same scam, Phil, so why
don't we cut through the bullshit?

02:54.667 --> 02:56.701
<i>How much you figure
you're owed on this?</i>

02:56.766 --> 02:59.000
- 25%.
- Don't be an asshole.

02:59.108 --> 03:01.803
You know, there's close monitoring
at every fucking landfill.

03:01.946 --> 03:04.113
Maybe if somebody had been
upfront with me from the beginning.

03:04.176 --> 03:06.973
Nobody's been hiding nothing. I had the
same dumping deal with what's-His-Name,

03:07.018 --> 03:10.612
The operation's manager since I've
been there at barone sanitation.

03:10.756 --> 03:13.112
You're not there
no more. I am.

03:13.186 --> 03:16.023
You're enjoying your
generous severance package.

03:16.126 --> 03:19.190
25%-- That's not
gonna happen.

03:19.358 --> 03:22.362
You've got a backyard,
a pool, dump it there.

03:22.466 --> 03:24.863
That's my only
other suggestion.

03:31.778 --> 03:33.942
He's got us by the gazz'.
I'll tell you that.

03:34.046 --> 03:36.600
Unless that guy at the pennsy
landfill decides to play ball.

03:36.647 --> 03:39.771
That asshole's shitting his pants
he'll get pinched by the epa.

03:39.876 --> 03:42.042
Frankly, Ton',

03:42.146 --> 03:43.880
I'm thinking maybe we
should meet Phil's number.

03:43.957 --> 03:47.783
Why? I think that would set a
terrible precedent right now.

03:47.925 --> 03:49.722
Just bend over...

03:49.826 --> 03:51.951
when he just became boss
of the family over there?

03:52.056 --> 03:54.791
Yeah, well,
that's the flying ointment.

03:56.125 --> 03:59.560
Even still,
I say let him have it.

03:59.666 --> 04:01.330
Life's too short.

04:01.406 --> 04:04.900
It's also too short to
live it as a fucking lackey.

04:04.975 --> 04:07.071
True too.

04:09.748 --> 04:11.241
What is this,
"make-Believe ballroom"?

04:11.317 --> 04:13.980
How many times you gonna
change the stations?

04:16.688 --> 04:18.752
This "departed" soundtrack's
fucking killer.

04:18.918 --> 04:20.750
<i>- You got it?
- Yeah, it's good.</i>

04:23.995 --> 04:27.320
Regarding, Phil,
I gotta ask:

04:27.426 --> 04:30.492
Whatever happened to
"stop and smell the roses"?

04:32.498 --> 04:34.301
You're right.

04:34.365 --> 04:36.761
U're right.

04:36.937 --> 04:40.102
You can't fight every
fucking battle, right?

04:41.605 --> 04:45.713
Asbestos...

04:56.286 --> 04:58.080
each day's a gift.

04:58.126 --> 05:00.722
Every time I look at my
kid, that's what I realiz

05:00.866 --> 05:03.562
And that shit
with Junior, please.

05:09.966 --> 05:13.302
Just that peoplike Phil,

05:13.476 --> 05:15.073
They're not
on that page--

05:15.148 --> 05:18.141
Take those rosesand stick 'em up
your ass, thorns first.

05:23.645 --> 05:26.652
<i>- This system's
got no balls.</i>

05:55.917 --> 05:58.783
So how was your party
that day at the hous

06:01.087 --> 06:03.220
Slow the fuck down,
will ya?!

06:27.216 --> 06:28.611
Maybe you sh
go back, heidi.

06:28.715 --> 06:30.982
Kennedy, I'm on my
learner's permit after dark.

06:40.596 --> 06:43.223
Ton'...

06:45.236 --> 06:48.232
you gotta...
help me.

06:48.405 --> 06:50.731
I'm coming.

06:53.005 --> 06:54.940
I'll never pass
the drug test.

06:55.008 --> 06:57.511
What?

06:57.618 --> 06:59.640
You gotta get me out.

06:59.776 --> 07:01.812
I'll lose my license.

07:51.735 --> 07:54.901
Never pass a drug test.

07:54.967 --> 07:56.632
Call me a taxi.

09:22.556 --> 09:24.293
<i>911.</i>

09:24.397 --> 09:25.993
We've been
in an accident.

09:26.127 --> 09:29.060
<i>Old pumping station road...</i>

09:29.228 --> 09:31.831
past the reservoir.

09:50.315 --> 09:51.851
Sorry about that.

09:51.956 --> 09:53.650
My friend...

09:53.786 --> 09:56.482
guy I came with,
how is he?

09:56.626 --> 10:00.293
<i>Your friend is dead.
Paramedics called it in the ambulance.</i>

10:00.428 --> 10:02.821
<i>Breathe in, please. Hold it.</i>

10:02.966 --> 10:05.590
Do you know a contact number
for his next of kin?

10:06.667 --> 10:10.971
His wife.

10:22.147 --> 10:25.611
<i>- Hello.
- Hello, may I speak with Carmela Soprano?</i>

10:25.687 --> 10:28.053
<i>- Who is this?
- Nurse al rosario,</i>

10:28.155 --> 10:31.491
<i>St. Clare's hospital, denville.
Is mrs. Soprano there?</i>

10:31.625 --> 10:33.493
Yes, this is
mrs. Soprano.

10:33.626 --> 10:36.391
<i>I'm here with your husband.
He'd like to speak with you.</i>

10:38.996 --> 10:42.501
<i>- Carm.
- Tony, is everything okay?</i>

10:42.636 --> 10:44.033
<i>Are you sitting down?</i>

10:44.177 --> 10:46.401
<i>- I'm serious.
- Yes, I'm in bed.</i>

10:46.508 --> 10:48.243
<i>All right, listen.</i>

10:48.348 --> 10:50.472
<i>Sweetheart,
there's been an accident.</i>

10:51.977 --> 10:54.212
<i>We were coming back
from the city and...</i>

10:55.517 --> 10:59.152
<i>- Christopher's dead.
- Oh my God!</i>

10:59.215 --> 11:01.221
All right.

11:01.357 --> 11:03.652
- Carm.
- What happened?

11:03.756 --> 11:07.362
He drove off the road
and the car flipped over.

11:07.397 --> 11:09.991
<i>- I'll tell you in detail.
- Are you okay?</i>

11:10.027 --> 11:11.992
I just banged my knee,
the one from high school.

11:12.038 --> 11:14.032
I'm fine, but...

11:15.535 --> 11:17.233
he wasn't wearing
a belt.

11:17.338 --> 11:19.171
Where are you,
St. Clare's?

11:19.236 --> 11:23.043
Listen, they're gonna call
kelli if they haven't already...

11:24.248 --> 11:26.173
just get al and rita
on the phone

11:26.247 --> 11:28.013
And get 'em started
over there.

11:28.046 --> 11:31.880
All right, all right.
Oh my God, Tony, he's dead?

11:31.956 --> 11:34.011
Yeah.

11:34.055 --> 11:37.422
All right.
L-Let me get dressed.

11:43.196 --> 11:45.233
Thank you.

12:09.887 --> 12:13.723
Mr. Tony,
Mr. Sil is here.

12:13.797 --> 12:15.521
Okay.

12:15.566 --> 12:18.733
- Mrs. Carmela say you should stay in bed.
- Have him come up.

12:18.796 --> 12:20.503
We're right here, Ton'.

12:20.566 --> 12:22.563
We came as soon
as we heard.

12:24.336 --> 12:27.570
- Ton'.
- Patsy went over to Chrissy's mom's house.

12:27.748 --> 12:30.141
- Yeah, that's where Carmela is.
- Carlo's coming up.

12:30.245 --> 12:31.742
Yeah.

12:36.417 --> 12:38.983
- How you doing, Ton'?
- My knee got banged up.

12:39.085 --> 12:41.081
<i>They said it's
probably gonna be okay.</i>

12:42.607 --> 12:45.321
Last thing
I remember was...

12:45.426 --> 12:47.362
we pulled away
from Phil.

12:47.426 --> 12:49.922
Skid marks all over the
place, the cops told Carm.

12:49.997 --> 12:52.992
He had a heavy foot,
that kid, always.

12:53.098 --> 12:54.932
Almost put me through
a billboard one time.

12:56.766 --> 12:59.002
- Hey, Ton'.
- Come on in.

12:59.106 --> 13:01.400
I'm so sorry, Ton'.

13:01.475 --> 13:03.372
I still can't
believe it.

13:03.508 --> 13:05.871
Thanks. I know
you two were close.

13:05.946 --> 13:07.541
I was making
my collections

13:07.716 --> 13:11.112
And Anthony maffei
called me. Jesus.

13:15.887 --> 13:19.050
<i>It's carlo, I bet.</i>

13:19.157 --> 13:21.993
Fucking idiot didn't even
have his seat belt on.

13:23.297 --> 13:26.063
His chest filled up.

13:27.237 --> 13:29.063
Suffocated
on his own blood.

13:29.137 --> 13:31.971
- Oh, Jesus.
- Jesus Christ.

13:32.076 --> 13:35.240
Seems like that's
the cause of death.

13:37.148 --> 13:39.642
It's not carlo.
I heard AJ.

13:39.718 --> 13:41.712
Carlo's coming up?

13:41.816 --> 13:43.912
What's with you and carlfucking arrival?

13:44.017 --> 13:47.451
- I'm just saying.
- They're gonna do a full blood test on him.

13:47.485 --> 13:50.052
See, you know,

13:50.155 --> 13:53.390
If alcohol,

13:53.421 --> 13:56.898
- Drugs or...
- It did occur to me.

13:57.034 --> 13:59.391
He didn't seem high,
did he?

13:59.499 --> 14:01.360
Are you kidding?
I would have been furi

14:01.439 --> 14:03.430
I would have fucking
strangled him.

14:03.505 --> 14:05.901
He'd been working the program
ever since he threw little Paulie

14:06.006 --> 14:08.841
- Out that window.
- Let's not go there.

14:08.907 --> 14:11.212
Even before that
he was battling that shit.

14:11.347 --> 14:13.172
He gave it his all.

14:13.348 --> 14:16.610
Well, anyway,
he's gone now,

14:16.686 --> 14:18.682
Our Chrissy.

14:20.086 --> 14:21.683
Crazy fucking maniac.

14:24.396 --> 14:25.850
The thing to take
to heart, t,

14:26.027 --> 14:27.993
You're here.
You're all right.

14:28.027 --> 14:30.021
You could have been killed,
for ck's sake.

14:30.197 --> 14:32.432
What are you gonna do?

14:35.867 --> 14:37.303
Thanks.

14:37.378 --> 14:39.701
Whoa.
What are you doing?

14:39.806 --> 14:42.202
No no no, I gotta
try and get up.

14:42.278 --> 14:45.743
Gotta go and meet Carm
over at Chrissy's.

14:45.816 --> 14:47.883
Kelli and all that.

14:49.615 --> 14:51.380
I'll make you
a plate.

14:51.456 --> 14:53.980
- Get me a scotch.
- Are you serious?

14:54.057 --> 14:56.821
Yeah, and have
one yourself.

15:00.565 --> 15:03.793
They were close,
two cousins.

15:08.765 --> 15:10.573
You all right?

15:11.907 --> 15:14.671
I know I had my
differences with that kid,

15:14.745 --> 15:18.170
But maybe I didn't
do right by him, neither.

15:18.248 --> 15:20.680
If you were his dad,
I was his dutch uncle,

15:20.748 --> 15:24.111
And what the fuck did
I do but get pissed off,

15:24.188 --> 15:27.920
Fight with him over
cocksucking fucking money?

15:28.027 --> 15:30.922
I'd break his balls when
he ied not to have a drink

15:30.997 --> 15:33.020
Or a little taste
of snow.

15:33.125 --> 15:35.763
It's over, Paulie.

15:41.166 --> 15:43.673
Did anybody ever hear
from the hospital?

15:43.778 --> 15:46.002
I was waiting
till kelli woke up.

15:47.478 --> 15:50.372
They found cocaine
in his blood.

15:50.445 --> 15:53.512
- Madonn'.
- 'Cause of death was a hemothorax.

15:53.547 --> 15:56.612
Yeah, airbags can crush the ribs
when there's no other restraint.

15:56.785 --> 15:59.611
They said he might
have made it,

15:59.785 --> 16:00.950
But he didn't.

16:01.058 --> 16:02.850
Couldn't have worn
his goddamn seat belt?

16:02.957 --> 16:05.323
- No wonder. He was
whack-A-Doo. - Al, just stop it.

16:05.357 --> 16:08.391
Aw, baloney. He leaves
our granddaughter fatherless.

16:09.798 --> 16:11.963
My only child!

16:12.066 --> 16:14.300
Drinking won't help,
honey.

16:14.368 --> 16:16.303
Jesus Christ.

16:20.308 --> 16:22.873
Look at this.
Syracuse is losing.

16:27.888 --> 16:29.783
I don't know
what to say.

16:29.886 --> 16:32.310
- What?
- I just got a call from little Paulie.

16:33.285 --> 16:35.152
Nucci gualtieri died.

16:37.025 --> 16:39.622
Stroke on the bus back
to the home.

16:39.697 --> 16:42.192
They had gone
to see "Jersey boys."

16:44.938 --> 16:47.600
This is difficult.

16:47.708 --> 16:50.501
This is pain

16:50.677 --> 16:52.371
Like I'm not used to.

16:52.405 --> 16:55.771
We've said before he was
like a son in some ways.

16:55.877 --> 16:58.041
To see him die
like that...

16:59.048 --> 17:00.712
practically
in my arms.

17:00.785 --> 17:04.351
He was just starting
his life.

17:04.516 --> 17:07.353
Yeah.

17:15.396 --> 17:17.133
You know what?

17:18.538 --> 17:21.300
- This is bullshit.
- What?

17:21.407 --> 17:24.032
I haven't been able
to tell anybody this, but...

17:25.806 --> 17:27.942
I'm fucking relieved.

17:28.045 --> 17:29.871
Really?

17:29.977 --> 17:31.972
He was a tremendous drag
on my emotions,

17:32.046 --> 17:35.583
On my... thoughts
about the future.

17:36.887 --> 17:38.850
Every morning
I wake up thinking,

17:38.886 --> 17:41.050
"Is today the day that
one of my best friends

17:41.125 --> 17:43.221
Is gonna dime me
to the FBI?"

17:43.428 --> 17:45.623
And a weak,
fucking sniveling,

17:45.657 --> 17:48.162
Lying drug addict? That's
the worst kind of bet.

17:48.225 --> 17:51.230
The biggest blunder
of my career

17:51.297 --> 17:53.531
Is now gone.

17:53.567 --> 17:57.072
And I don't have to be
confronted by that fact no more.

17:58.237 --> 18:00.371
And as a relative,
a friend,

18:00.406 --> 18:03.403
Someone you can
count on...

18:04.915 --> 18:06.770
I see.

18:11.617 --> 18:13.550
Let me tell you
something:

18:13.658 --> 18:16.882
I've murdered friends
before, even relatives--

18:17.028 --> 18:19.352
My cousin Tony,

18:19.458 --> 18:21.923
My best friend--
Puss.

18:23.625 --> 18:27.462
But this...

18:32.036 --> 18:34.443
was I talking
in my sleep?

18:34.546 --> 18:36.803
Snoring.

18:36.878 --> 18:38.611
I'm gonna put on the TV
if you don't mind.

18:38.677 --> 18:41.480
I can't stay asleep
either. I'm all...

18:47.486 --> 18:50.391
I mean, I can laugh and cry,
and I could always get the part.

18:50.498 --> 18:53.222
- First time?
- First time. Never can keep it.

18:53.358 --> 18:55.490
They got onto me
after a while.

18:55.627 --> 18:58.263
I'd lose my voice, fall
down, get red in the face,

18:58.365 --> 19:01.001
Talk too fast
and couldn't act.

19:31.265 --> 19:33.732
Can you make me
a cappuccino?

19:33.836 --> 19:36.830
That fucking machine from Paulie,
you need a pilot's license.

19:40.606 --> 19:43.573
It's so hard not to think of
Christopher as a child, isn't it?

19:43.617 --> 19:47.041
Caity kind of looks likeim,
which makes it doubly hard

19:48.618 --> 19:50.911
Of course that's not
gonna do her any favors

19:51.018 --> 19:53.552
When she hits puberty--
That schnoz.

19:53.618 --> 19:56.182
A lot of women
found him very attractive.

19:58.556 --> 20:01.293
I think to myself,

20:01.466 --> 20:05.190
How could I have ever said
those things about him,

20:05.308 --> 20:09.030
About him and adriana, what
her mother said he did to her?

20:15.106 --> 20:17.410
Obviously he was violent as an adult.

20:17.478 --> 20:21.143
His upbringing,
but he adored Ade.

20:21.285 --> 20:23.750
He could never let
himself take her life.

20:25.715 --> 20:27.382
Why are we
so quick to blame?

20:27.485 --> 20:29.123
What is
the attraction in that?

20:43.065 --> 20:45.073
It's good.

20:45.108 --> 20:47.071
Thank you.

20:49.145 --> 20:52.240
When I called you...

20:52.315 --> 20:53.943
the night after
the accident,

20:54.085 --> 20:55.813
And you asked me,

20:55.915 --> 20:58.652
"Oh my God, Tony,
he's dead?"

20:58.755 --> 21:00.851
Yeah.

21:00.926 --> 21:03.150
And I thought--

21:03.255 --> 21:06.152
Well, I thought
I picked up a twinge of...

21:09.665 --> 21:11.590
- relief.
- What?

21:11.667 --> 21:13.261
It just seemed like--
I don't know--

21:13.336 --> 21:15.662
How could you say that? You don't
know what you're talking about.

21:15.805 --> 21:17.103
Okay, good, I'm wrong.

21:17.206 --> 21:19.102
Maybe if you did pick up
something like that,

21:19.207 --> 21:21.341
Maybe it's because
I warelieved...

21:21.478 --> 21:23.373
that it was him
and not you.

21:23.477 --> 21:26.371
Well, don't feel bad about
that. That makes sense.

21:29.386 --> 21:32.151
To be going down
to the hospital again

21:32.216 --> 21:34.222
At 2:00 in the morning?

21:39.395 --> 21:41.623
And you know what?
When you were shot,

21:41.696 --> 21:43.962
It was Christopher
who held me.

21:48.806 --> 21:51.701
You know
the baby's car seat?

21:53.205 --> 21:55.871
A giant tree branch
came through the window

21:55.906 --> 21:57.911
And demolished it.

22:00.487 --> 22:03.310
She would have
been dead, caitlin,

22:03.418 --> 22:05.481
Mangled beyond
recognition.

22:18.395 --> 22:20.292
I told her about
the baby seat

22:20.407 --> 22:22.331
So she wouldn't
feel so rotten.

22:22.406 --> 22:25.031
I mean, he was high as a fucking
kite. I didn't tell her that.

22:25.076 --> 22:28.600
In retrospect,
maybe not the best approach.

22:28.676 --> 22:32.410
Right,
I'm the asshole... again.

22:34.048 --> 22:36.443
What?

22:38.187 --> 22:40.011
No, go ahead.

22:41.586 --> 22:44.693
It's amazing
how things work.

22:44.795 --> 22:48.260
His mother,
cousin joanne,

22:48.368 --> 22:50.023
A lush.

22:50.128 --> 22:52.962
Totally abandoned him
as a parent,

22:53.038 --> 22:55.763
But now she's reaping
all the sympathy

22:55.866 --> 22:57.973
And the tears.

22:58.138 --> 23:00.701
How are you doing,
Anthony?

23:02.546 --> 23:05.211
There have been
some hard moments.

23:07.215 --> 23:09.543
But a weak,
lying drug at

23:09.648 --> 23:11.612
Who fantasized
about my downfall,

23:11.657 --> 23:14.052
Who even showed people
his filthy thoughts

23:14.157 --> 23:16.151
On a movie screen...?

23:18.125 --> 23:21.120
Let me tell you something:
I've seen friends die before,

23:21.225 --> 23:23.793
Accidents,

23:23.896 --> 23:25.962
Even murder.

23:26.065 --> 23:28.063
My cousin Tony,
they shot his face away.

23:28.165 --> 23:31.501
And I was fucking
prostate with grief.

23:31.606 --> 23:33.133
But this?

23:34.348 --> 23:36.340
I see.

23:36.447 --> 23:38.642
And it occurs to me,
I hand-Carried this kid

23:38.678 --> 23:41.180
Through the worst
crisis he ever had.

23:43.185 --> 23:46.450
I can't go
into particulars, but...

23:46.616 --> 23:48.781
wives, girlfriends,

23:48.928 --> 23:50.691
They can complicate life
in a major way.

23:50.855 --> 23:52.992
I don't have to
tell you that.

23:56.326 --> 23:59.293
Anyway, huge problem
of his own making.

24:01.508 --> 24:04.302
And he cried.
He couldn't deal with it.

24:04.375 --> 24:06.102
So...

24:06.138 --> 24:08.970
I took up the slack.
I handled it.

24:09.106 --> 24:11.043
I felt sorry
for him.

24:12.478 --> 24:14.341
Now he talked gratitude...

24:16.046 --> 24:17.680
but guess what py
produces in the recipient.

24:17.787 --> 24:19.883
<i>They shit
on your pity.</i>

24:21.558 --> 24:24.522
That's what broke
the camel's back.

24:24.625 --> 24:28.291
How are you
handling all this?

24:28.367 --> 24:30.792
The worst part,
truthfully,

24:30.895 --> 24:33.063
Is I gotta sit there

24:33.168 --> 24:36.630
Withple
who are hurting... bad.

24:37.838 --> 24:41.002
And I gotta have
the long face

24:41.076 --> 24:44.010
And the sighing
and the platitudes.

24:45.576 --> 24:47.540
But I don't feel it.

24:50.248 --> 24:52.510
Then that makes me feel
like a hypocrite.

24:54.686 --> 24:57.052
And that makes
me mad at them.

25:20.047 --> 25:22.281
Oh, hi.

25:22.348 --> 25:24.951
How are you?

25:30.027 --> 25:31.422
Julianna skiffle,

25:31.525 --> 25:34.263
This is my wife
Carmela Soprano.

25:34.397 --> 25:35.721
Skiff.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.933
Oh, yeah, right.

25:38.065 --> 25:41.732
Julianna's a real estate
agent in the old neighborhood.

25:41.805 --> 25:43.703
And you knew
Christopher?

25:43.807 --> 25:45.473
I used to buy my meat
at Satriale's.

25:49.106 --> 25:52.443
I'm a recovering addict.

25:53.715 --> 25:56.441
- I owe him a lot.
- That's nice to hear.

25:58.917 --> 26:02.053
- Well, what are you gonna do, huh?
- Nothing you can do.

26:02.088 --> 26:04.550
That's my point.

26:04.626 --> 26:06.253
He was too young.

26:08.827 --> 26:10.890
Good-Looking woman.

26:30.987 --> 26:33.252
They did
a beautiful job on him.

26:40.365 --> 26:42.591
Oh, I'm gonna go up.

26:43.865 --> 26:46.662
I'll go up later,

26:46.766 --> 26:49.663
Give my seat to someone
in the meantime.

26:54.478 --> 26:56.472
How are you doing?

26:59.178 --> 27:02.210
- It's tough.
- Yeah.

27:02.317 --> 27:04.481
He loved y so much.

27:05.786 --> 27:08.380
- Yeah?
- Well, you know he did.

27:14.328 --> 27:16.393
I'll go up later.

27:33.216 --> 27:36.482
There she is.
3 to 5, 7 to 9.

27:36.587 --> 27:38.153
<i>Why do they call her that?</i>

27:38.215 --> 27:39.752
She never
misses a wake.

27:45.095 --> 27:46.491
Oh, lord, oh, lord!

27:46.557 --> 27:48.561
Fucking
James brown now.

27:51.738 --> 27:53.930
I'm serious.
I can't take it.

27:54.005 --> 27:57.501
It's all right.
We're here for you.

27:57.575 --> 28:00.100
Oh my God.
Look at this.

28:04.347 --> 28:07.512
- Like a movie star.
- Jackie kennedy.

28:25.768 --> 28:28.300
- I'm sorry for the loss of your cousin, bro.
- Thanks.

28:28.407 --> 28:31.470
Me too, bro, me too.

28:31.576 --> 28:33.701
He was a good guy.

28:33.775 --> 28:37.112
Hey, don't let
this linger

28:37.245 --> 28:38.513
On your head now.

28:38.717 --> 28:39.811
You know what
I'm talking about.

28:51.656 --> 28:53.323
You know that night,

28:53.425 --> 28:55.593
A tree limb came in
through the car window,

28:55.666 --> 28:59.062
Completely destroyed
the baby seat.

28:59.138 --> 29:01.300
Tony.

29:01.437 --> 29:04.303
You guys are gonna
hang in a while, right?

29:04.435 --> 29:07.073
We really should make an
appearance at the other wake.

29:26.496 --> 29:28.792
Are we that late?

29:28.865 --> 29:30.662
Glad you came.

29:30.798 --> 29:32.930
- He'll appreciate it.
- Oh, please.

29:48.988 --> 29:50.810
I gotta
get out of here.

29:54.985 --> 29:56.953
- Paul.
- Ton'.

29:57.998 --> 29:59.993
Thanks for coming.

30:01.625 --> 30:03.732
We are so sorry
for your loss, Paulie.

30:03.795 --> 30:05.860
How you hangin' in,
paolucc'?

30:05.995 --> 30:07.402
As well as can be expected.

30:07.506 --> 30:09.161
Must be very
hard for you.

30:09.236 --> 30:11.172
I know how close the two
of you had become again

30:11.235 --> 30:12.671
Yeah.

30:12.807 --> 30:14.473
Not much
of a sendoff here.

30:14.508 --> 30:17.810
- The room is beautiful, Paulie.
- Nobody's in it.

30:17.875 --> 30:19.573
What kind
of testament is this

30:19.677 --> 30:21.340
To the spirit and
generosity of the woman?

30:21.415 --> 30:23.083
We're here
for you, Paulie.

30:23.188 --> 30:24.811
You know that.

30:24.885 --> 30:26.350
Okay.

30:31.328 --> 30:33.321
It's a fundamental
lack of respect

30:33.355 --> 30:35.223
And I'm never gonna
fuckin' forget it, neither.

30:35.365 --> 30:38.263
Jesus, Paulie, people your
mother's age, their friends die off.

30:38.368 --> 30:40.163
What, she outlived
sil? Carlo?

30:40.305 --> 30:41.862
They're all over there
at your nephew's.

30:42.007 --> 30:44.533
- Yeah, but-- - Councilman
carillo was here three minutes.

30:44.607 --> 30:46.173
I clocked him.

30:48.546 --> 30:51.372
People are comin'
and they don't, fuck 'em.

30:51.415 --> 30:53.740
I got 500 prayer cards.

30:53.888 --> 30:55.113
Well, Carm and I aere.

30:55.188 --> 30:56.340
What the fuck
is that? Nothin'?

30:57.617 --> 30:59.181
No, Ton', of course not.

30:59.255 --> 31:01.883
- Means the world.
- Okay.

31:03.588 --> 31:05.350
She suffered too,
you know.

31:05.428 --> 31:08.063
Yeah, well, this isn't
the time or the place.

31:08.196 --> 31:09.963
You're right.

31:13.366 --> 31:15.031
How have you been
dealing witht?

31:15.066 --> 31:17.973
It's really sad but it's
kinda the same as with blanca.

31:18.038 --> 31:21.172
I mean, I don't really just keep
thinking about things the way I did--

31:21.205 --> 31:23.342
Over and over,
you know?

31:23.377 --> 31:26.372
Well, for one thing,
perhaps the meds are working.

31:27.987 --> 31:29.643
Did you finally enroll?

31:29.785 --> 31:31.713
I'm in a few classes

31:31.887 --> 31:34.220
Unofficially, until my
transcript clears from ramapo.

31:34.326 --> 31:36.322
Beginning english.

31:36.388 --> 31:38.893
Oh, and I went
to a class on the history

31:39.055 --> 31:40.793
Of the israeli-Palestinian
conflict.

31:40.926 --> 31:44.062
- Wow.
- I mean, it's hard to pick up in the middle.

31:44.166 --> 31:46.333
I might take it
xt semester.

31:46.397 --> 31:48.661
I mean, it's so
dicked-Up over there

31:48.806 --> 31:51.103
And no one knows
who started it.

31:51.178 --> 31:52.803
- Are you sleeping?
- What? In class?

31:52.977 --> 31:56.100
No. You were having
trouble, remember?

31:58.075 --> 32:00.442
Wellbutrin xl
kicks ass.

32:00.518 --> 32:02.940
I'm hearing good things
about the lexapro.

32:02.986 --> 32:05.083
Check it, paisan.
Long John shithead.

32:08.055 --> 32:10.181
That kid's in my
south American lit class.

32:10.288 --> 32:12.351
He had his toes amputated.

32:17.298 --> 32:19.131
He said it was an accident
with his car battery.

32:19.165 --> 32:20.800
Acid burned right
through his shoe.

32:36.718 --> 32:39.353
Oh, you litt
shfooyadell.

32:39.488 --> 32:41.123
She should nurse.

32:42.155 --> 32:43.890
At least somebody
feels like eating.

32:45.355 --> 32:47.660
She doesn't know.

32:47.725 --> 32:49.761
Isn't God wonderful
that way?

32:59.907 --> 33:02.970
<i>- Hello?
- Alan, it's Tony. You busy?</i>

33:03.076 --> 33:04.713
Usual shit--
Some Japanese guy

33:04.817 --> 33:07.142
Got his suit ruined
at cirque du soleil.

33:07.185 --> 33:09.983
<i>- Listen, I need a suite.
- So all the guys coming out?</i>

33:10.085 --> 33:11.880
No no. I'm solo.

33:11.986 --> 33:14.853
Oh. We'll see what
we can do about that.

33:15.026 --> 33:18.093
<i>Look, I just want to-
Peace and quiet...</i>

33:18.228 --> 33:20.720
- ...chill out.
- You set for transpo?

33:20.826 --> 33:23.192
<i>I'll be happy
to send a plane.</i>

33:58.367 --> 33:59.592
No more bets.

34:02.035 --> 34:05.033
33 black odd.

34:15.217 --> 34:16.411
No more bets.

34:18.918 --> 34:21.920
Five red odd.

34:56.085 --> 34:58.153
It's hard to imagine
for a poet,

34:58.258 --> 35:01.692
But wordsworth
was as rich and popular

35:01.797 --> 35:03.460
As, say, someone like

35:03.596 --> 35:05.963
<i>John grisham nowadays.</i>

35:06.037 --> 35:08.101
But wordsworth writes

35:08.206 --> 35:10.830
"The world is
too much with us."

35:10.937 --> 35:13.202
Later, he invokes
nature again.

35:14.847 --> 35:18.342
Why such strong words
against the material world?

36:02.585 --> 36:05.422
That was fast.

36:05.525 --> 36:07.261
The gatehouse
usually gives

36:07.396 --> 36:09.391
Shitty directions to
the east tower. Come in.

36:11.767 --> 36:13.702
<i>So...</i>

36:14.935 --> 36:18.000
you're a friend
of Chris.

36:18.076 --> 36:20.373
Yeah...
Tony, by the way.

36:20.478 --> 36:22.241
No, I know.

36:22.346 --> 36:23.872
He's mentioned you,
actually.

36:23.946 --> 36:26.572
Well, I heard nothing
but nice things about you.

36:27.948 --> 36:31.513
Except... you're more
beautiful than he let on.

36:31.616 --> 36:33.680
<i>- Really?
- Talked about ya...</i>

36:33.756 --> 36:36.682
a few times, told me more
than once to look you up.

36:36.757 --> 36:38.092
Did he?

36:39.527 --> 36:41.292
Well well well.

36:44.538 --> 36:46.131
You want a drink
or something?

36:46.267 --> 36:48.961
I got some pinot grigio
in the fridge.

36:54.806 --> 36:57.440
I got some, uh...

36:57.546 --> 36:59.640
serious news.

36:59.716 --> 37:02.043
- Uh-Oh.
- It's about Christopher.

37:03.546 --> 37:05.712
- He's dead.
- At?

37:06.887 --> 37:08.550
It was a car accident,

37:08.658 --> 37:10.823
Happened
a couple days ago.

37:14.066 --> 37:15.891
Oh my God.

37:16.898 --> 37:19.060
That's fucking awful.

37:19.236 --> 37:21.031
I'm sorry.

37:21.068 --> 37:24.431
- What happened?
- Bad wreck...

37:24.507 --> 37:26.631
high-Speed...

37:28.178 --> 37:29.800
he was killed instantly.

37:29.907 --> 37:31.811
Somehow, I walked away.

37:31.918 --> 37:33.942
Jesus, that must
have been scary.

37:34.017 --> 37:37.250
The fuckin' sound alone...

37:37.316 --> 37:39.912
did he ever...

37:40.088 --> 37:42.583
marry that one girl--The one wh-

37:42.655 --> 37:44.350
No.

37:45.426 --> 37:47.262
Found a real sweetheart,
though-- Kelli--

37:47.365 --> 37:49.260
And...

37:49.365 --> 37:51.030
they just had
a baby girl.

37:51.097 --> 37:53.090
Maybe that's good,
you know?

37:54.507 --> 37:57.771
I mean,
bad that he left her,

37:57.878 --> 38:00.671
But good that he--
He left something.

38:06.447 --> 38:08.611
I thought
you should know.

38:13.685 --> 38:15.622
Well, um...

38:18.798 --> 38:21.290
extremely cool, you coming
over here. I appreciate that.

38:23.396 --> 38:25.731
- How long you here for?
- I don't know.

38:25.797 --> 38:28.800
Just play it as I go.

38:49.156 --> 38:51.322
<i>- What's up?
- It's stefano.</i>

38:51.397 --> 38:54.262
Look, I'm sorry to bother you,
but I'm here at the school.

38:54.398 --> 38:56.092
<i>The asbestos,
it's backing up.</i>

38:56.166 --> 38:57.990
<i>I've gotta dump
this shit.</i>

38:58.165 --> 39:00.262
<i>It's not wrapped to code and
all the other violations--</i>

39:00.337 --> 39:03.161
- Yeah?
- I could get nailed big time.

39:03.237 --> 39:05.201
We're workin' on it, John.

39:05.336 --> 39:06.771
I'm trying
to negotiate it out,

39:06.835 --> 39:08.442
But the asshole's
taking a hard line for now.

39:08.477 --> 39:11.011
Just hang in there,
let me do my thing.

39:11.116 --> 39:12.941
All right.

39:18.755 --> 39:20.351
- Whoa.
- Jeff'll clean it up.

39:20.428 --> 39:22.223
Make him clean it
in his bare feet.

39:22.286 --> 39:25.353
I got the venison steaks!

39:25.525 --> 39:29.422
Oh!

39:29.565 --> 39:31.593
Oh!

39:32.766 --> 39:35.202
What the fuck?
You blind?

39:35.367 --> 39:38.003
Me?! You open the door,
you don't look at all.

39:38.108 --> 39:40.072
Aw, shit, you wrecked
my fuckin' door.

39:40.135 --> 39:42.370
- You did that to your own door!
- Whoa whoa whoa.

39:42.476 --> 39:44.042
What the fuck
did you say?

39:44.118 --> 39:46.311
I said he opened the door,
he don't look at all.

39:46.415 --> 39:48.082
Look at my fuckin' bike!

39:48.147 --> 39:50.011
- Do you hear this guy?
- You saw it!

39:50.118 --> 39:52.651
Fuck you, nigger.

39:54.657 --> 39:56.150
I am not a nigger!

39:56.286 --> 39:58.651
I am from somalia!
I go to school and I work!

39:58.756 --> 40:00.220
Do not call me
a nigger!

40:00.326 --> 40:02.323
So you're some
terrorist piece of shit.

40:02.395 --> 40:05.061
Either way, motherfucker,
you're in the wrong neighborhood.

40:05.136 --> 40:06.892
Get the fuck away!

40:08.666 --> 40:10.500
You a tough nigger now?!

40:10.578 --> 40:12.502
You got something to say?

40:14.307 --> 40:16.741
<i>Cocksucker!</i>

40:57.215 --> 41:00.252
Do you mind?

41:00.315 --> 41:03.380
No, knock yourself out.

41:06.626 --> 41:09.393
This is the--

41:09.496 --> 41:12.030
This is the new shit--

41:12.138 --> 41:14.660
Medical-Grade, mellow,

41:14.737 --> 41:16.731
Paranoia-Free.

41:19.005 --> 41:21.703
Oh, well, that's good.

41:28.216 --> 41:31.482
Oh, Chris loved
to party.

41:31.586 --> 41:33.983
What's your point?

41:34.056 --> 41:36.980
Nothing.
You just...

41:37.057 --> 41:39.822
remind me
of him, obviously.

41:41.825 --> 41:44.161
What's that mean?
I fuck like him?

41:47.438 --> 41:50.001
So much
for paranoia-Free.

41:50.107 --> 41:52.600
No, you were his
friend, that's all.

41:52.677 --> 41:55.173
Why would you
bring him up?

41:55.245 --> 41:58.010
All I'm saying

41:58.076 --> 41:59.613
Is that there's
a certain kind of guy

41:59.677 --> 42:01.942
That I don't run into
on campus.

42:02.016 --> 42:04.413
But where I dance--

42:04.555 --> 42:07.183
That accent,
the clothes.

42:07.286 --> 42:08.852
I'm a type?

42:09.028 --> 42:11.693
This coming from the girl who's
stripping her way through college?

42:11.798 --> 42:14.523
Actually,
you're a surprise.

42:14.626 --> 42:16.691
Chris sometimes talked
about some sad shit,

42:16.868 --> 42:19.033
But you seem--
I don't know--

42:20.737 --> 42:22.132
Actually sad.

42:22.207 --> 42:25.132
Not right now I'm not.

42:25.206 --> 42:27.873
Jesus, this is some
pretty fucking amazing dope.

42:29.807 --> 42:32.612
Chris said you two...

42:32.716 --> 42:34.410
took peyote together.

42:34.487 --> 42:36.481
Yeah.

42:36.586 --> 42:40.153
I mean, I haven't done
buttons in a while, though.

42:45.427 --> 42:47.920
You know, I've been thinking
why the fuck I'm here.

42:47.995 --> 42:49.823
You can get
to that place.

42:49.966 --> 42:52.932
No. No, I mean Vegas.

42:52.997 --> 42:56.001
<i>Truth is I always wanted
to try that shit...</i>

42:57.635 --> 42:59.802
but I always had

42:59.937 --> 43:02.803
All the responsibilities.

43:07.085 --> 43:09.910
You're a hard man
to reach.

43:09.987 --> 43:11.851
Nobody's seen hide
nor hair.

43:11.918 --> 43:13.782
Yeah, I'm away.
What do you want?

43:13.886 --> 43:15.723
<i>What do I want?
I'm returning your call.</i>

43:15.827 --> 43:17.552
I think this got nothing
to do with asbestos.

43:17.628 --> 43:20.290
Why don't you let go of the
old shit and be a businessman?

43:20.367 --> 43:22.961
- You got everything you want.
- Not everything.

43:23.025 --> 43:26.593
But listen, allow me
to express my condolences

43:26.766 --> 43:28.600
Regarding your nephew.

43:28.708 --> 43:30.161
This is me hanging up.

43:39.818 --> 43:42.482
- I can tell you're upset.
- Big fucking deal.

43:42.548 --> 43:46.512
- What exactly happened this week?
- Nothing.

43:48.226 --> 43:51.951
You know, people walk around
like this is all something.

43:51.998 --> 43:54.292
They'rfucking laughing

43:54.365 --> 43:56.190
And nobody takes
even one second

43:56.326 --> 43:58.061
To think about
what's really going on.

43:58.166 --> 44:00.130
You sound
depressed again.

44:00.197 --> 44:03.403
How can anybody not be?
You'd have to be fucking nuts

44:03.535 --> 44:05.331
Not to be.

44:05.408 --> 44:08.302
I mean, you'd have to have
your head wedged so far

44:08.376 --> 44:10.302
Up your ass that all
you could see

44:10.377 --> 44:12.541
Is your own stupid face.

44:12.675 --> 44:14.480
What specifically
are you talking about?

44:14.545 --> 44:18.150
I mean, everything
is so fucked up.

44:22.086 --> 44:24.923
Why can't we all
just get along?

44:30.965 --> 44:33.803
You don't have to
chew it.

44:35.307 --> 44:37.471
You just wash it down
like a pill.

46:45.367 --> 46:48.460
It's the same principle
as the solar system.

46:55.148 --> 46:58.473
No more bets.

47:00.386 --> 47:03.081
- 24.
- Yes.

47:04.217 --> 47:05.750
Nice.

47:10.828 --> 47:13.920
Press it all.

47:23.567 --> 47:25.770
No more bets.

47:31.046 --> 47:32.870
20.

47:32.945 --> 47:35.713
Holy fucking shit.

47:42.458 --> 47:44.893
Here.

47:44.958 --> 47:46.952
Much appreciated.

47:59.136 --> 48:01.873
<i>No more bets.</i>

48:15.788 --> 48:18.122
24 again.

48:28.506 --> 48:31.531
- He's dead.
- What?

48:31.607 --> 48:33.603
What?

48:46.156 --> 48:47.251
What?

50:10.336 --> 50:12.200
I get it.

50:19.777 --> 50:23.081
I get it!
