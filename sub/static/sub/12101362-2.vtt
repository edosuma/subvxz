00:06.963 --> 00:08.486
<i>Previously on</i> Dynasty... What if I said

00:08.530 --> 00:10.488
that I <i>was</i> responsible
for my mother's death?

00:10.532 --> 00:13.013
And what if your father
knows all about this

00:13.056 --> 00:14.623
and he's trying to make me pay?

00:14.666 --> 00:15.754
Shelly Duncan?

00:15.798 --> 00:17.060
I do know Adam,

00:17.104 --> 00:18.670
and I'm afraid he
might be dangerous.

00:18.714 --> 00:20.324
I just sent
the final signed contract,

00:20.368 --> 00:23.023
putting up my personal assets
as collateral.

00:23.066 --> 00:25.068
Eric's logic
just sold us the loan.

00:25.112 --> 00:26.156
I'm pretty sure
that's the priest

00:26.200 --> 00:27.070
<i>Cristal's been sleeping with.</i>

00:28.506 --> 00:30.247
So, you still want
to marry me tomorrow?

00:30.291 --> 00:31.901
<i>Not only do I want to marry you</i>

00:31.944 --> 00:34.208
but I want to be with you
every day after that.

00:34.251 --> 00:36.036
And I promise you
that no one

00:36.079 --> 00:37.559
will ever tear us apart.

00:38.386 --> 00:40.518
♪ Sun is shinin'
on my shoulders ♪

00:40.562 --> 00:42.607
♪ Oh, ooh ♪ Never want it to be over

00:42.651 --> 00:44.957

00:45.001 --> 00:47.873

00:52.052 --> 00:54.184
♪ With you, yeah.

00:56.404 --> 00:58.188
Power gardening tools

00:58.232 --> 01:01.017
should never be turned on
before 10:00 a.m.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.193
Not even when it's
for our wedding?

01:04.020 --> 01:05.195
Oh, is that today?

01:05.239 --> 01:06.718
Speaking of which,

01:06.762 --> 01:09.373
you have to get out of here
before everyone realizes

01:09.417 --> 01:11.680
I slept with the groom
pre-wedding

01:11.723 --> 01:13.943
and locusts start
raining down upon us.

01:13.986 --> 01:16.467
Well, after the rehearsal
dinner from hell, I just...

01:16.511 --> 01:19.296
thought we weren't worrying
-about tradition anymore.
-Yeah.

01:19.340 --> 01:21.559
I guess you're right. With Sam
performing the ceremony,

01:21.603 --> 01:24.127
we've pretty much tossed
tradition out the window.

01:25.824 --> 01:28.218
Are you...
taking notes

01:28.262 --> 01:29.393
on our conversation?

01:29.437 --> 01:30.742
I'm finishing my vows.

01:30.786 --> 01:33.005
And since tradition's
out the window,

01:33.049 --> 01:34.006
you want to hear
a quick preview?

01:34.050 --> 01:36.052
No! Absolutely not.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.575
Some things are still sacred.

01:37.619 --> 01:40.143
Plus, I don't want to be
bored during the ceremony.

01:40.187 --> 01:42.145
Quite the vote of confidence.
Thank you.

01:42.189 --> 01:43.886
Aw.

01:43.929 --> 01:45.540
Don't look so sad.

01:45.583 --> 01:47.237
I'm sure
whatever you wrote is great.

01:47.281 --> 01:48.804
Now get out of here
so I can finish mine.

01:48.847 --> 01:50.414
Okay.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.068
See you at the altar?

01:52.112 --> 01:53.635
No kissing.

01:57.291 --> 01:59.423
I need your office
to send me proof of sale

01:59.467 --> 02:01.773
as well as evidence of shipping.

02:01.817 --> 02:02.861
Great.

02:02.905 --> 02:04.472
We have a deal.

02:05.516 --> 02:06.648
Bang.

02:06.691 --> 02:08.998
600,000 more barrels secured.

02:09.041 --> 02:11.827
-Where are we?
We are
at 8.2 million barrels.

02:11.870 --> 02:14.177
We need around two million
to fill the order.

02:14.221 --> 02:15.439
So you're giving me
all afternoon

02:15.483 --> 02:17.398
to lock down
the last 1.8 million?

02:17.441 --> 02:18.616
Well, that's easy.

02:18.660 --> 02:19.965
Really? Where you gonna get it?

02:20.009 --> 02:21.793
I know a supplier named
Cliff Wilson.

02:21.837 --> 02:23.447
Haven't tapped
into him yet.

02:23.491 --> 02:25.971
He could easily sell us
enough oil to cover this.

02:26.015 --> 02:27.408
We deliver the oil to Accordion,

02:27.451 --> 02:29.627
collect payment,
repay the loan before it's due

02:29.671 --> 02:31.716
in... four hours and 40 minutes.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.502
Otherwise the bank's gonna start
grabbing my personal assets.

02:34.545 --> 02:36.504
I don't think it'll get to that.

02:39.246 --> 02:40.943
Uh... Oh, right.

02:40.986 --> 02:43.511
I need to get some...

02:43.554 --> 02:45.252
eggs.

02:45.295 --> 02:46.383
Hey there.

02:46.427 --> 02:47.732
You're early.

02:47.776 --> 02:49.212
You know the wedding's
not for hours, right?

02:49.256 --> 02:50.953
I hope you don't mind.

02:50.996 --> 02:51.997
I came here to get dressed.

02:52.041 --> 02:53.564
The rooms

02:53.608 --> 02:56.698
at La Mirage don't quite have
the space I'm used to.

02:56.741 --> 02:57.699
And definitely

02:57.742 --> 02:59.440
-not enough mirrors.
-Surprising,

02:59.483 --> 03:02.094
considering how much Sam loves
to look at himself.

03:04.009 --> 03:06.011
We still have a long way to go
before...

03:06.055 --> 03:07.404
Yeah. No, I know that.

03:07.448 --> 03:09.580
And remember what we discussed
about today.

03:09.624 --> 03:11.147
It's all about
the wedding.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.976
No mention of priests
or Van Kirks.

03:14.019 --> 03:15.238
Exactly.

03:15.282 --> 03:17.632
It's Fallon's day,
not ours.

03:19.111 --> 03:21.549
I'll see you later.

03:24.943 --> 03:27.990
I always felt out of place
in Wyoming, you know?

03:28.033 --> 03:29.339
I mean...

03:29.383 --> 03:30.862
I was an amazing line dancer.

03:30.906 --> 03:33.082
But only because I had
a huge crush on the cowboy

03:33.125 --> 03:34.692
-who taught me.
-Cute.

03:34.736 --> 03:37.042
-I practiced a lot.
-I thought you said
you grew up in Ohio.

03:37.086 --> 03:38.522
Mm-hmm. I did.

03:38.566 --> 03:40.481
Yeah, my mom and I moved
to Wyoming when I was ten.

03:40.524 --> 03:42.178
Where was your dad?
I thought they're still married.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.877
They are. Yeah, um,
he... stayed in New Orleans--

03:45.921 --> 03:47.531
um, I mean Ohio

03:47.575 --> 03:49.185
for a few
more-more months.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.491
It was
a long time ago.

03:50.534 --> 03:51.927
Let's talk about you.

03:51.970 --> 03:54.321
So, uh, you're officiating
a wedding tonight.

03:54.364 --> 03:55.887
You're excited?

03:55.931 --> 03:58.325
Well, I'm not exactly in
a "till death do us part" mood.

03:58.368 --> 03:59.804
Oh. I get it.

03:59.848 --> 04:03.330
I mean, traditional weddings
are pretty...

04:03.373 --> 04:05.157
pretty corny.
When my brother...

04:05.201 --> 04:06.724
You lied to me, Ryan.

04:06.768 --> 04:08.813
You didn't get bumped
off your flight,

04:08.857 --> 04:11.512
and you don't even have
a new one booked home.

04:11.555 --> 04:13.514
How... I called the airline.

04:13.557 --> 04:16.386
Wait, you called the airline?

04:16.430 --> 04:17.605
That's...

04:17.648 --> 04:18.823
Crazy?

04:18.867 --> 04:22.349
No, crazy is lying
about a law school visit

04:22.392 --> 04:24.394
just to swindle the first...

04:24.438 --> 04:27.397
hot, mildly successful guy
you meet.

04:27.441 --> 04:28.746
You are a scammer, buddy.

04:28.790 --> 04:32.315
Yes, I changed my flight.
But not to scam you.

04:32.359 --> 04:33.621
I just... You just

04:33.664 --> 04:34.926
what?

04:34.970 --> 04:36.667
I was trying to make
a romantic gesture.

04:36.711 --> 04:38.495
And-and
I only got flustered

04:38.539 --> 04:40.018
because I like you, okay?

04:40.062 --> 04:41.498
But instead of telling me,

04:41.542 --> 04:45.110
you decided creating
a web of lies was a better plan?

04:45.154 --> 04:46.764
I was worried, Sam.
I mean...

04:46.808 --> 04:48.592
come on, we-we got married,

04:48.636 --> 04:50.507
and I was only
a little bit drunk.

04:50.551 --> 04:52.596
I just--
I-I didn't want to come across

04:52.640 --> 04:55.599
as desperate or a stalker.

04:55.643 --> 04:58.385
Look, I want
to believe you.

04:58.428 --> 05:00.865
But, um, I've
experienced firsthand

05:00.909 --> 05:02.867
that once a liar,
always a liar.

05:02.911 --> 05:04.739
So, uh...

05:04.782 --> 05:06.044
Yeah.

05:06.088 --> 05:07.785
You should
get going.

05:11.876 --> 05:13.182
<i>So, his name's</i>

05:13.225 --> 05:14.401
Cliff Wilson.

05:14.444 --> 05:15.619
He's about to sell Blake

05:15.663 --> 05:16.751
the final crude oil
installment

05:16.794 --> 05:18.318
he needs to
bring C.A. back.

05:18.361 --> 05:19.580
But, I think,
for the right price,

05:19.623 --> 05:20.972
he'd be willing
to sell to you.

05:21.016 --> 05:22.322
-Well, for the price
we'll offer,

05:22.365 --> 05:23.235
Cliff should be willing
to sell us

05:23.279 --> 05:24.628
his firstborn child.

05:24.672 --> 05:26.151
Blake won't be able
to get the oil he needs

05:26.195 --> 05:27.979
to fulfill his contract in time.

05:28.023 --> 05:30.155
Be careful. He knows
he's racing against the clock.

05:30.199 --> 05:31.418
Well, he can race all he wants.

05:31.461 --> 05:32.767
We own the clock.

05:32.810 --> 05:33.985
It's perfect.

05:34.029 --> 05:35.465
Okay.

05:35.509 --> 05:38.686
I'm going to help
my daughter get married.

05:38.729 --> 05:41.602
You two can handle
this transaction?

05:43.343 --> 05:45.301
-We got it.
-Mm.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.650
Look at you guys,

05:46.694 --> 05:48.391
finally becoming friends.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.698
Warms my heart.

05:53.309 --> 05:54.919
We're not friends.

05:54.963 --> 05:56.660
I know.

05:57.748 --> 05:59.359
No.

06:01.404 --> 06:02.884
Okay.

06:03.885 --> 06:05.147
Mm. Maybe.

06:05.190 --> 06:07.323
What bride doesn't have
her shoes picked out

06:07.367 --> 06:08.542
before the wedding day?

06:08.585 --> 06:09.934
Well, I did.

06:09.978 --> 06:11.632
But that's when the ceremony was
in a church.

06:11.675 --> 06:13.373
Different venue,
different footwear.

06:13.416 --> 06:14.591
Well, maybe you should
just go barefoot

06:14.635 --> 06:16.550
so we don't miss
the actual ceremony.

06:16.593 --> 06:17.899
She does have a point.

06:17.942 --> 06:19.074
Also, you'll be
walking on grass now.

06:19.117 --> 06:20.423
Maybe stilettos

06:20.467 --> 06:21.816
aren't the
best idea?

06:21.859 --> 06:23.383
Oh, please.

06:23.426 --> 06:25.036
All I need is
the right Sherpa

06:25.080 --> 06:28.213
and lots of oxygen and I could
climb Mount Everest in heels.

06:28.257 --> 06:31.652
Okay? I'm not trading beauty
for comfort on my wedding day.

06:31.695 --> 06:33.349
-Let me see those.
-Is there
some kind of...

06:33.393 --> 06:35.917
...wedding program
that I can look at?

06:35.960 --> 06:37.701
I don't want to mess things up
in front of a crowd.

06:37.745 --> 06:38.746
Aw.

06:38.789 --> 06:40.269
Preshow jitters are normal.

06:40.312 --> 06:41.705
I remember when I played

06:41.749 --> 06:44.708
Fantine in <i>Les Mis,
I was always nervous preshow.</i>

06:44.752 --> 06:46.884
But once the curtain
came up,

06:46.928 --> 06:47.755
I killed it.

06:47.798 --> 06:49.191
<i>Les Mis?</i> Like on Broadway?

06:49.234 --> 06:50.888
Yeah, yeah.
Like on Broadway but, you know,

06:50.932 --> 06:52.586
in high school, which is, uh...

06:52.629 --> 06:53.804
which is harder than Broadway.

06:53.848 --> 06:55.458
Besides, you'll be great.

06:55.502 --> 06:56.807
Oh, Liam and I

06:56.851 --> 06:58.722
will be reading
our own vows. Actually,

06:58.766 --> 07:00.289
I will be singing mine,

07:00.332 --> 07:02.291
assuming I finish writing them.

07:02.334 --> 07:03.466
Speaking of,

07:03.510 --> 07:04.859
let me show you what I have.

07:11.822 --> 07:14.695
Do you happen to remember who
your understudy for Fantine was?

07:39.676 --> 07:42.505
Does it hurt
-when I do this?
-Ow! Yes!

07:42.549 --> 07:44.420
Note to self,
don't do that.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.726
Maybe it's broken.

07:45.769 --> 07:47.510
It's not broken.

07:48.859 --> 07:50.382
Okay.
But it's not great.

07:50.426 --> 07:52.341
Oh. I thought we were done
with bad things happening.

07:52.384 --> 07:53.995
This wedding is clearly cursed.

07:54.038 --> 07:55.431
What if my whole life is cursed?

07:55.475 --> 07:57.346
What if nothing good
ever happens to me again?

07:57.389 --> 07:59.348
-What if I peaked in high school?
-Fallon,

07:59.391 --> 08:00.480
you're spiraling.

08:00.523 --> 08:02.003
And it's not good
for your worry lines.

08:02.046 --> 08:03.613
And where is Kirby
with the ice?

08:03.657 --> 08:05.397
Mm. She's probably
having a drink first.

08:05.441 --> 08:06.921
Come on, let's get you up.

08:06.964 --> 08:08.183
Okay.
Here we go.

08:08.226 --> 08:09.837
Okay. Let's get
her sitting down.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.142
I just was sitting down.

08:14.885 --> 08:16.017
Great.

08:16.060 --> 08:17.497
I made it two feet.

08:17.540 --> 08:20.456
But unless we move the wedding
to my bedroom,

08:20.500 --> 08:22.371
how am I gonna make it
-down the aisle?
-Well,

08:22.414 --> 08:23.851
Blake is walking you
down the aisle.

08:23.894 --> 08:25.156
Why don't you just...

08:25.200 --> 08:27.681
use him as a crutch and go slow?

08:27.724 --> 08:29.117
And you might want to...

08:29.160 --> 08:31.293
rethink your shoe selection.

08:31.336 --> 08:33.164
I am not wearing flats.

08:33.208 --> 08:35.036
Not today. Not ever.

08:35.079 --> 08:36.646
I would rather crawl.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.258
I just don't think
Blake will be enough.

08:40.302 --> 08:41.695
Well, he never was
for me.

08:41.738 --> 08:43.566
-Ew.
-Okay, Mother,

08:43.610 --> 08:46.264
do you think that you could
possibly find the strength

08:46.308 --> 08:48.571
to put your differences
with Blake aside

08:48.615 --> 08:50.051
for as long as it takes

08:50.094 --> 08:51.879
for you guys to help me hobble
down the aisle?

08:51.922 --> 08:53.576
Of course.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.883
I was wondering why I wasn't
doing it in the first place.

08:55.926 --> 08:56.884
Way to make it about you.

08:56.927 --> 08:58.059
Blake's not gonna be happy.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.103
I'‘ll handle
Blake.

09:00.801 --> 09:02.019
But not right now.

09:02.063 --> 09:04.108
Um, first,
I have to finish my song.

09:04.152 --> 09:05.893
Can you escort me
-down to the piano?
-Yeah.

09:05.936 --> 09:07.721
So I can keep writing it.
And, Mom,

09:07.764 --> 09:09.723
you stay here and, um...

09:09.766 --> 09:13.161
try to come up with a rhyme
for "publisher."

09:16.468 --> 09:19.384
Would you like to guess
what I'm holding in my hand?

09:19.428 --> 09:22.431
Uh... new apartment lease
because you're moving out.

09:22.474 --> 09:24.041
Cute. This is a deed

09:24.085 --> 09:26.391
for all mineral rights
underneath Carrington Manor,

09:26.435 --> 09:27.610
which I own--

09:27.654 --> 09:29.351
well, the mineral
rights, not the manor.

09:29.394 --> 09:33.398
It was left in a
safe-deposit box <i>for me</i>

09:33.442 --> 09:36.967
by our father,
Thomas Carrington.

09:37.011 --> 09:38.665
It's my daughter's wedding day.

09:38.708 --> 09:40.057
Is there a point to this?

09:40.101 --> 09:41.102
Yes.

09:41.145 --> 09:43.408
While you may own
the manor land,

09:43.452 --> 09:46.542
I own anything valuable <i>
under</i> the land.

09:47.891 --> 09:50.241
Rubies, emeralds, whatever.

09:50.285 --> 09:52.026
But since I don't have
the time or the money

09:52.069 --> 09:53.723
to start
excavating,

09:53.767 --> 09:56.683
I'm offering you a chance
to buy my rights.

09:56.726 --> 09:59.468
For a suitable price, of course.

09:59.511 --> 10:00.861
Suitable for who?

10:00.904 --> 10:03.037
I expect to be
-fairly compensated.
-Mm.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.908
No one knows
what treasures lie

10:04.952 --> 10:06.562
-below the surface.
-Look,

10:06.606 --> 10:09.783
I never heard anything about my
father splitting property rights

10:09.826 --> 10:11.611
or leaving you
anything,

10:11.654 --> 10:13.264
so I think I'll politely pass
on your offer.

10:13.308 --> 10:15.005
I think that's a big mistake.

10:15.049 --> 10:17.181
Well, I think I'll be okay.

10:17.965 --> 10:20.184
I'm sorry to show
up unannounced,

10:20.228 --> 10:22.447
especially on your sister's
wedding day.

10:22.491 --> 10:26.495
I just felt like we should
talk about this in person.

10:26.538 --> 10:28.279
Talk about what?

10:28.323 --> 10:30.673
I... I don't know why
you're here in Atlanta.

10:30.717 --> 10:35.199
A man named Joseph Anders
came to see me in Montana,

10:35.243 --> 10:38.289
and he was asking a lot of
questions about your mother.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.248
Such as...?He seemed to have

10:40.291 --> 10:43.555
suspected that you had some
involvement in her overdose.

10:43.599 --> 10:44.992
And I assume you told him

10:45.035 --> 10:46.123
that nothing could be
further from the truth.

10:46.167 --> 10:48.473
Well, I was very vague.

10:48.517 --> 10:52.173
I mean, I do remember a few
things that seemed suspicious,

10:52.216 --> 10:54.871
but I'm willing to forget them

10:54.915 --> 10:59.354
if he or the police asks again.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.445
For a price, I assume.

11:03.488 --> 11:07.841
Well, reimbursement
for my travel, obviously.

11:07.884 --> 11:10.147
And some spending money,

11:10.191 --> 11:12.497
since I'm
retired now.

11:13.237 --> 11:17.285
Uh, I really appreciate you
bringing this to me first...

11:17.328 --> 11:19.026
Shelly.

11:19.069 --> 11:22.507
I have some wedding obligations
I need to fulfill,

11:22.551 --> 11:25.075
so how about we meet
back here later,

11:25.119 --> 11:27.425
when everyone's
at the party, and...

11:28.426 --> 11:31.386
...I'll get you what you want.

11:31.429 --> 11:36.696
♪ You and me and...

11:36.739 --> 11:38.393
There you are.

11:38.436 --> 11:41.091
They told me you needed
a fresh one of these.

11:41.135 --> 11:42.876
Looks angry.

11:42.919 --> 11:45.966
Gonna be tough to hobble down
the aisle with that, hmm?

11:46.009 --> 11:48.577
Oh, funny
you should mention that.

11:48.620 --> 11:49.970
I have a request.

11:50.013 --> 11:52.450
I will <i>not</i> carry you
over the threshold.

11:52.494 --> 11:55.802
Okay, that's more of a
bride-groom thing, so, no.

11:55.845 --> 11:58.369
I was hoping it
would be okay if

11:58.413 --> 12:00.371
Alexis walked with us
down the aisle.

12:00.415 --> 12:02.678
I'm just worried about how
I'm gonna make it...

12:02.722 --> 12:03.984
I have no problem with it.

12:04.027 --> 12:05.986
What?

12:06.029 --> 12:08.640
Oh. Okay, I had a
whole speech planned.

12:08.684 --> 12:10.164
It's your day, sweetheart.

12:10.207 --> 12:13.428
I will do whatever you need
to get you down the aisle.

12:15.473 --> 12:16.823
Are you okay?

12:16.866 --> 12:18.563
Yeah, I just...

12:18.607 --> 12:20.391
I can't believe both
my parents are stepping up

12:20.435 --> 12:22.524
for me when I need them, and...

12:22.567 --> 12:24.004
Yeah.

12:24.047 --> 12:27.398
Okay. Thanks for the ice.

12:29.836 --> 12:31.272
Don't turn around.

12:31.315 --> 12:34.014
How did you get on with Adam?

12:34.057 --> 12:38.322
He wants to meet later,
but he makes me nervous.

12:38.366 --> 12:40.542
Oh, don't worry.
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

12:40.585 --> 12:42.283
You don't know that.

12:42.326 --> 12:44.546
I know that you think
he's dangerous,

12:44.589 --> 12:47.157
but that's the reason why
you agreed to do this.

12:47.201 --> 12:49.812
Adam can't get away
with killing his mother,

12:49.856 --> 12:52.989
and he can't be allowed to hurt
other people, like my daughter.

12:53.033 --> 12:55.078
You're right, I know.

12:55.122 --> 12:57.646
It's just...

12:57.689 --> 12:59.648
he may not admit it to me.

12:59.691 --> 13:01.128
We need proof.

13:01.171 --> 13:02.912
And what if he attacks me?

13:02.956 --> 13:05.828
I'll have men
stationed nearby.

13:05.872 --> 13:08.613
You won't be
in any danger.

13:08.657 --> 13:12.269
Worst case, we can also charge
him with attempted murder.

13:14.706 --> 13:16.883
Too soon for jokes?

13:16.926 --> 13:19.320
Fair enough.

13:19.363 --> 13:20.887
Yeah.
Hey, it's Blake Carrington.

13:20.930 --> 13:22.410
Listen, I'm just wondering

13:22.453 --> 13:23.977
when I can expect
the final payment to come in.

13:24.020 --> 13:26.893
You guys are kind of cutting it
down to the wire here.

13:26.936 --> 13:29.460
What? No.
No, that's impossible.

13:29.504 --> 13:31.723
Look, I'll-I'll call you
right back.

13:32.855 --> 13:35.423
Cliff, hey.
I was just about to call you.

13:35.466 --> 13:37.425
What the hell is going on, huh?

13:37.468 --> 13:39.166
Why hasn't the oil been
delivered to Accordion?

13:39.209 --> 13:40.471
We had a deal.

13:40.515 --> 13:42.038
That's why I'm calling.

13:42.082 --> 13:43.866
I made a little
accounting mistake.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.607
Those 1.8 million barrels
of crude

13:45.650 --> 13:47.609
had already been pre-sold
to someone else.

13:47.652 --> 13:49.741
Hey, that's not a mistake!
That is a giant...

13:49.785 --> 13:51.743
Funny thing.
No one bothered to tell me.

13:51.787 --> 13:54.877
Anyway, I can probably
get you what you need.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.661
Just give me a week or two.

13:56.705 --> 13:59.316
I don't <i>have</i> a week
or two, Cliff!

13:59.360 --> 14:02.189
I got three hours
to find two million barrels

14:02.232 --> 14:04.234
or $100 million
to pay back the bank.

14:04.278 --> 14:07.368
Yeah, I can't help you
with either of those, partner.

14:22.557 --> 14:25.429
It's so nice to see you
back in this room.

14:27.431 --> 14:29.390
Can we talk for a minute?

14:29.433 --> 14:32.741
If I can ask you
a question first.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.525
Sure.

14:34.569 --> 14:36.919
I just got a call from
the hospital clinic.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.703
Did you put a hold
on their funding?

14:38.747 --> 14:39.922
From the foundation?

14:39.966 --> 14:41.445
Yeah, and it's just temporary.

14:41.489 --> 14:44.144
So you're <i>taking</i> money
from charity now?

14:44.187 --> 14:46.537
What is wrong with you?

14:46.581 --> 14:48.539
I borrowed it. I'll replace it
in a few days, I promise.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.672
I saw all those
monitors in your office,

14:50.715 --> 14:52.413
like a control center.

14:52.456 --> 14:54.197
Is there something going on?

14:54.241 --> 14:58.158
Yes. Uh, my company is
in some trouble.

14:58.201 --> 15:00.334
And I know how you feel
about my business, but

15:00.377 --> 15:02.771
this time, I have
personal assets on the line,

15:02.814 --> 15:04.294
and I am out of oil.

15:04.338 --> 15:05.992
That's why I wanted
to talk to you.

15:06.035 --> 15:07.341
What can I do about that?

15:07.384 --> 15:09.343
Well, about the oil, nothing.

15:09.386 --> 15:13.173
But, um... I need some money
to pay back the bank.

15:13.216 --> 15:15.784
And I was wondering if
there's any way that you could

15:15.827 --> 15:17.568
talk to your father
about a quick loan.

15:17.612 --> 15:20.093
He would have his money back
before he knew it was gone.

15:20.136 --> 15:21.703
It would mean the world to me.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.532
To us.

15:24.575 --> 15:26.490
So first,
you steal from the clinic,

15:26.534 --> 15:29.841
and now you want me to just get
back in business with my father?

15:29.885 --> 15:32.192
When I've spent my life
trying to get away from that?

15:32.235 --> 15:34.890
This is different. This could be
the end of Carrington Atlantic.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.937
The fact that you would even
ask me to do that shows how much

15:37.980 --> 15:40.983
this company has destroyed
the man I fell in love with.

15:41.027 --> 15:43.029
My answer is this.

15:43.072 --> 15:44.769
Nothing would make me happier

15:44.813 --> 15:46.989
than to watch
Carrington Atlantic

15:47.033 --> 15:48.556
crash and burn.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.688
It may be the only way
to save our marriage.

15:59.001 --> 16:01.264
Everybody ready?

16:16.236 --> 16:17.541
Amazing.

16:17.585 --> 16:19.761
Darling, you look beautiful.

16:20.936 --> 16:22.677
Oh, make sure
it's not Liam, please.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.548
I mean, the way things
are going, the dress might just

16:24.592 --> 16:27.073
split right down the middle
the second he walks in the room.

16:27.116 --> 16:29.162
It's your dad.

16:29.205 --> 16:30.815
Okay.

16:34.210 --> 16:36.169
Oh.

16:36.212 --> 16:38.388
You look...

16:38.432 --> 16:40.216
Thank you, Daddy.

16:40.260 --> 16:42.218
Can I have a moment
with the bride?

16:49.921 --> 16:51.793
Thank you for being so great

16:51.836 --> 16:53.795
about Alexis and
the aisle walk.

16:53.838 --> 16:55.710
I know it was supposed
to be your thing,

16:55.753 --> 16:58.800
but you have to admit, it was
a little patriarchal anyway.

16:58.843 --> 17:01.716
It's your day.
I want it to be perfect.

17:01.759 --> 17:05.850
Which is why I hate
to do this right now, but, um,

17:05.894 --> 17:07.287
it's a bit of an emergency.

17:07.330 --> 17:10.507
Oh. Well, I mean,
what kind of an emergency?

17:10.551 --> 17:13.858
Well, um, it's about C.A.

17:13.902 --> 17:16.426
Yeah, I borrowed some money
to replace the oil

17:16.470 --> 17:18.472
that we lost
in the refinery explosion.

17:18.515 --> 17:20.474
One of my suppliers has screwed
me out of my last few barrels,

17:20.517 --> 17:22.650
and I'm not getting paid,
which means

17:22.693 --> 17:24.782
I can't pay back
the loan on time.

17:24.826 --> 17:27.481
Was that just a really
long-winded way

17:27.524 --> 17:28.830
of asking me for money?

17:28.873 --> 17:32.007
The loan is due
in less than an hour.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.444
Now, I'm about to call the bank
and ask them for an extension,

17:34.488 --> 17:36.011
but if they don't
give it to me...

17:36.055 --> 17:37.969
I'll pay you back as soon
as I sort this out.

17:38.013 --> 17:40.668
-How much do you need?
-It's just under a hundred mil.

17:40.711 --> 17:43.105
-No.
-It's just a wire transfer.

17:43.149 --> 17:44.585
I'll take care of everything.

17:44.628 --> 17:47.327
You won't have
to give it another thought.

17:48.328 --> 17:50.678
Wow.

17:50.721 --> 17:53.811
This is why you were
being so nice today. Yeah.

17:53.855 --> 17:57.032
And why you were agreeing to
walk down the aisle with Alexis.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.686
You were just buttering me up.

17:58.729 --> 18:00.601
For what?
A wire transfer?

18:00.644 --> 18:03.647
I'm an idiot
for actually believing

18:03.691 --> 18:05.693
my father was gonna
come through for me.

18:05.736 --> 18:06.998
Don't worry.

18:07.042 --> 18:09.566
My mother will walk me
down the aisle. Alone.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.700
<i>I don't understand.</i>

18:12.743 --> 18:15.137
Why couldn't this be
taken care of on the phone?

18:15.181 --> 18:18.749
Because I wanted
to see you.

18:18.793 --> 18:22.318
And apologize
for calling you a liar,

18:22.362 --> 18:25.887
and not letting you have
a late check-out.

18:25.930 --> 18:27.932
-What changed?
-Well, actually,

18:27.976 --> 18:29.934
seeing Fallon with her parents
on her wedding day

18:29.978 --> 18:32.850
made me realize
that I was being cynical.

18:32.894 --> 18:34.635
So you tricked me
into coming back?

18:34.678 --> 18:37.551
Well, "tricked" has kind of
a negative feel to it.

18:37.594 --> 18:38.726
I would think of it

18:38.769 --> 18:41.772
maybe as a romantic gesture.

18:43.252 --> 18:44.949
I really am sorry.

18:44.993 --> 18:46.951
Apology accepted.

18:46.995 --> 18:49.171
But...

18:49.215 --> 18:51.086
I fly out in an hour.

18:51.130 --> 18:54.655
If you want to call the airline
to confirm, be my guest.

18:54.698 --> 18:58.137
Okay. I deserved that.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.486
Look, earlier,

18:59.529 --> 19:02.271
you said that you were flustered

19:02.315 --> 19:04.360
because you had feelings for me.

19:04.404 --> 19:07.189
And, uh, I think I acted
the way I did because...

19:07.233 --> 19:09.626
because I have feelings for you.

19:09.670 --> 19:11.759
What if you stay
a couple more nights?

19:11.802 --> 19:13.804
You could be my plus-one
to Fallon's wedding tonight,

19:13.848 --> 19:15.632
and that would give us
a chance to talk.

19:15.676 --> 19:18.766
I have a dozen tuxedos
for you to try on.

19:18.809 --> 19:21.464
None of them breakaway.

19:21.508 --> 19:23.988
Look, I... I appreciate
the gesture,

19:24.032 --> 19:25.338
but, uh,

19:25.381 --> 19:26.817
I think I just need a-a moment

19:26.861 --> 19:29.603
to step back
and-and process all this?

19:29.646 --> 19:32.171
-Okay. I get it.
-Yeah?

19:32.214 --> 19:33.563
But let's maybe not

19:33.607 --> 19:36.000
ruin a good thing
before it starts.

19:36.044 --> 19:37.959
Well, how about this? Um,

19:38.002 --> 19:41.397
you'll hear from me
if I want to keep talking.

19:41.441 --> 19:43.617
Take as much time as you need.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.707
Just not too much.

19:47.490 --> 19:49.884
All right.

19:52.539 --> 19:54.193
Eric, it's Blake Carrington.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.673
Listen, I am gonna need
a little flexibility

19:56.717 --> 19:58.545
on that loan deadline.

19:59.372 --> 20:01.591
What? What? You sold it to who?

20:02.636 --> 20:05.116
Yeah. Yeah, I want you
to put me through.

20:09.295 --> 20:10.905
Hello?

20:10.948 --> 20:13.690
Alexis?
What the hell's going on?

20:13.734 --> 20:16.171
I assume Eric told you
he sold your loan.

20:16.215 --> 20:19.261
You know how banks do that
sometimes to cover themselves?

20:19.305 --> 20:21.263
Yeah, I know he sold the loan.

20:21.307 --> 20:23.309
Why am I talking
to you about it?

20:23.352 --> 20:25.876
Because he sold it to us.

20:25.920 --> 20:27.748
Pleasure doing
business with you.

20:28.575 --> 20:30.533
I want you both
out of my house.

20:30.577 --> 20:31.882
Actually,

20:31.926 --> 20:33.710
unless you can
pay back the loan in...

20:33.754 --> 20:36.104
Forty....40 minutes,

20:36.147 --> 20:38.149
this isn't your house anymore.

20:38.193 --> 20:39.542
You understand.

20:39.586 --> 20:41.414
We'll have no
choice but to take

20:41.457 --> 20:43.372
all the collateral
you put up.

20:43.416 --> 20:44.808
Including the manor.

20:44.852 --> 20:46.157
I have most of the loan back.

20:46.201 --> 20:47.855
I'm just working
on the last little bit.

20:47.898 --> 20:49.900
Oh, we know it's more
than a little bit, Blake.

20:49.944 --> 20:50.814
Even for you.

20:50.858 --> 20:52.207
And no, we
can't offer you

20:52.251 --> 20:53.687
an extension.

20:53.730 --> 20:55.993
Nothing personal,
just business.

20:56.037 --> 20:57.081
You can't do this!

20:57.125 --> 20:58.387
But we're not cruel.

20:58.431 --> 20:59.954
Oh, of course not,
sweetheart, no.

20:59.997 --> 21:03.436
You don't have to leave
until after the wedding.

21:06.439 --> 21:08.397
Hey, stop it!

21:08.441 --> 21:10.269
Fallon?

21:10.312 --> 21:11.835
I thought you were upstairs.

21:11.879 --> 21:14.969
And I thought you were
the one good parent I had left.

21:25.719 --> 21:27.764
Uh, just bring
your left shoulder

21:27.808 --> 21:29.679
forward a smidge?

21:29.723 --> 21:31.812
That's too much of a smidge.

21:32.856 --> 21:34.510
Perfect.

21:37.992 --> 21:39.254
Hi.

21:39.298 --> 21:40.864
Wow. Are you okay?

21:40.908 --> 21:43.650
Well, my right ankle is
the size of a grapefruit,

21:43.693 --> 21:47.088
my father just asked
me for $100 million,

21:47.131 --> 21:49.220
and my mother stole
the house from him.

21:49.264 --> 21:50.352
So I've been better.

21:50.396 --> 21:51.658
What?

21:51.701 --> 21:52.920
Look, I'll explain
everything in the car.

21:52.963 --> 21:55.314
Can you give us a minute?

21:55.357 --> 21:57.751
-Hey.
-Hey.

21:57.794 --> 21:59.970
What do you say
we blow this popsicle stand

22:00.014 --> 22:02.146
and get married somewhere else?

22:02.190 --> 22:04.932
Weddings are just
for the guests anyway, right?

22:04.975 --> 22:06.977
I'm in. Where do you want to go?

22:07.021 --> 22:09.676
The last place everything
was perfect for me.

22:09.719 --> 22:11.591
By the way, you look beautiful.

22:11.634 --> 22:15.029
Thank you, but you may have
to carry me up these steps.

22:15.072 --> 22:17.727
That was almost as good
as putting Blake in jail.

22:17.771 --> 22:19.381
The look on his face.

22:19.425 --> 22:21.340
Oh, did you see
Fallon's face?

22:21.383 --> 22:23.820
She's going to kill me.

22:23.864 --> 22:26.432
Fallon's a big girl, okay?

22:26.475 --> 22:28.738
She's seen worse.
She's done worse.

22:28.782 --> 22:30.697
She's still my daughter, Jeff.

22:30.740 --> 22:32.612
I'm supposed to help her,
not hurt her.

22:32.655 --> 22:34.048
It's what
mothers do.

22:34.091 --> 22:36.529
Yeah, I'm not sure
Dominique got that memo.

22:36.572 --> 22:37.965
It's not always easy.

22:38.008 --> 22:40.010
You would understand that
if you had kids.

22:42.578 --> 22:44.711
Oh... I'm sorry.

22:44.754 --> 22:47.931
That just slipped out,
but I don't even know

22:47.975 --> 22:50.194
if you want them-- children.

22:50.238 --> 22:52.806
-Do you?
-Do you really want
to talk about this now?

22:52.849 --> 22:54.764
Fallon is starting
her new life with Liam.

22:54.808 --> 22:56.810
I finally have my home back.

22:56.853 --> 22:59.682
You should have
what you want, too.

22:59.726 --> 23:01.641
I don't want to deny you
the chance to have

23:01.684 --> 23:04.252
the life that you see
for yourself.

23:05.079 --> 23:08.691
I guess I do want children, um,

23:08.735 --> 23:10.824
-someday.
-Which means,

23:10.867 --> 23:13.130
there's no future
for this marriage.

23:13.174 --> 23:16.090
Which we both
kind of knew going in.

23:16.133 --> 23:19.093
Have your lawyer draw up
the divorce papers.

23:19.136 --> 23:20.442
And I'll, uh,

23:20.486 --> 23:21.574
sign over my share of the house

23:21.617 --> 23:23.227
to you, of course.

23:24.664 --> 23:26.666
Thanks, Alexis.

23:29.799 --> 23:32.236
Thank you.

23:33.716 --> 23:34.978
Mmm.

23:35.022 --> 23:37.894
Are you supposed
to be eating that right now?

23:37.938 --> 23:39.722
Guests haven't even
started arriving yet.

23:39.766 --> 23:41.376
I can eat whatever I want.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.596
I'm basically the most important
person at this wedding.

23:43.639 --> 23:46.120
Okay, does that mean
you've seen the happy couple?

23:46.163 --> 23:48.383
No, but...

23:50.646 --> 23:52.996
Okay, check your phone,
but be discreet.

23:54.824 --> 23:57.174
Discreet-er.

23:58.567 --> 24:00.264
[phone chimes]
What?

24:00.308 --> 24:02.963
Fallon and Liam are
at a-a high school? What?!

24:03.006 --> 24:05.095
She's been feeling
nostalgic all day.

24:05.139 --> 24:07.489
They want me to come officiate
and you to bring her new shoes.

24:07.533 --> 24:09.404
But we can't tell anyone.

24:09.448 --> 24:12.276
And we shouldn't
leave together, either.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.104
Meet me there.

24:14.148 --> 24:15.758
Okay.

24:15.802 --> 24:17.325
Oh, um...

24:17.368 --> 24:19.109
uh...

24:21.677 --> 24:24.811
Congratulations on your new house.

24:26.639 --> 24:28.336
-Are you really moving in?
-Nah.

24:28.379 --> 24:30.643
Oh!
I just wanted to
make Blake suffer.

24:30.686 --> 24:33.428
Alexis wants it. I was never
interested in living here.

24:33.472 --> 24:36.170
Oh, I don't know. You might
want to think about it.

24:36.213 --> 24:39.260
A Black man owning
-Carrington Manor.
-Mm.

24:39.303 --> 24:41.088
Would definitely
make a statement.

24:41.131 --> 24:42.916
And you could change the name.

24:42.959 --> 24:44.918
Oh, I'm sure
Alexis is already on that.

24:46.659 --> 24:48.225
That's a good point.

24:48.269 --> 24:50.706
Oh, Blake must be
losing his mind.

24:50.750 --> 24:55.058
It is nice to see him finally
get a taste of his own medicine.

24:55.102 --> 24:57.017
Mm.

24:57.060 --> 24:58.540
Hey, where are you going?

24:58.584 --> 25:01.108
Ah. Did you ever talk to Ryan?

25:01.151 --> 25:03.806
Actually, I need
to talk to you for a second.

25:03.850 --> 25:05.721
Can you come with me?

25:05.765 --> 25:08.289
O... kay.

25:12.859 --> 25:13.903
Hi. You've reached
Fallon Carrington.

25:13.947 --> 25:15.078
Damn it. Voice mail.

25:15.122 --> 25:17.385
Let me try your phone.

25:17.428 --> 25:19.561
I imagine
she knows my number, as well.

25:19.605 --> 25:20.910
Really? Why?

25:26.655 --> 25:28.396
Ah.

25:29.963 --> 25:32.792
Anders, would you please

25:32.835 --> 25:34.576
tell my father
to stop calling me?

25:34.620 --> 25:35.882
Fallon, it's me.

25:35.925 --> 25:36.926
Where are you?

25:36.970 --> 25:38.232
If I wanted you to know that,

25:38.275 --> 25:39.799
I wouldn't have disappeared.

25:39.842 --> 25:41.235
Fallon, look, I
know you're upset.

25:41.278 --> 25:43.411
<i>I'm</i> upset. But what
your mother's trying

25:43.454 --> 25:45.239
to pull is selfish,
and it's stupid.

25:45.282 --> 25:46.806
She's trying
to take everything from me.

25:46.849 --> 25:48.372
This is exactly why I left.

25:48.416 --> 25:50.723
You are making this about you,
even on my wedding day.

25:50.766 --> 25:51.811
So just leave me out
of this, okay?

25:51.854 --> 25:53.160
Ladies and gentlemen,

25:53.203 --> 25:54.814
welcome to our production

25:54.857 --> 25:56.729
of Liam and Fallon's wedding.

25:56.772 --> 25:58.382
Liam!

25:58.426 --> 26:00.297
Goodbye.

26:01.995 --> 26:03.605
What is it?

26:03.649 --> 26:05.259
Hey, Adam just texted me.

26:05.302 --> 26:07.174
He said
he needs a few more hours?

26:07.217 --> 26:09.916
Yeah, there's been some sort
of minor delay at the wedding.

26:09.959 --> 26:12.745
Um, why don't you just
say to him

26:12.788 --> 26:14.094
you can't wait any longer?

26:14.137 --> 26:15.748
I don't have
a good feeling about this.

26:15.791 --> 26:18.228
I told you I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

26:18.272 --> 26:21.275
Everything's in place,
my security team's standing by.

26:21.318 --> 26:23.146
As soon as you get a confession,

26:23.190 --> 26:25.105
you're on your way
back to Montana.

26:25.148 --> 26:26.715
How am I supposed
to get a confession

26:26.759 --> 26:28.064
if he doesn't show up?

26:28.108 --> 26:30.632
Text him back.

26:30.676 --> 26:32.591
I'm on my way.

26:34.680 --> 26:36.246
Oh, my God.

26:36.290 --> 26:38.422
How do you not have bunions,
girl?

26:38.466 --> 26:39.989
Shoe, shoe, shoe.

26:40.033 --> 26:43.079
Oh. Flats.

26:43.906 --> 26:47.127
Let's see how it goes. Okay.

26:49.172 --> 26:52.088
Which ones do you want?

27:01.402 --> 27:03.970
Oh.

27:04.013 --> 27:06.276
Okay.

27:07.756 --> 27:09.584
Kirby, right?

27:09.628 --> 27:11.194
Evan Tate.

27:11.238 --> 27:12.500
What are you doing here?

27:12.543 --> 27:13.980
Looking for Fallon.

27:14.023 --> 27:15.808
I have to talk to
her about something.

27:15.851 --> 27:16.852
On her wedding day?

27:16.896 --> 27:18.811
It's urgent. Where is she?

27:18.854 --> 27:23.685
I don't know. Did you try, like
outside... where the wedding is?

27:23.729 --> 27:26.340
It doesn't look like
the wedding's started yet.

27:26.383 --> 27:28.255
Aren't you supposed
to be with the bride?

27:28.298 --> 27:31.084
I just...
forgot my shoes.

27:31.127 --> 27:33.390
But those are Fallon's
shoes, not yours.

27:33.434 --> 27:36.176
You know, I seem to
have lost my phone.

27:36.219 --> 27:37.525
Could I borrow
yours for a moment?

27:37.568 --> 27:39.396
Or just tell me
where she is.

27:39.440 --> 27:41.747
Get away from me!

27:44.575 --> 27:46.577
You're not going anywhere!

28:01.723 --> 28:04.073
Thank you.

28:12.038 --> 28:15.650
So this is where
-the magic happened?
-Yes.

28:15.694 --> 28:18.871
They still talk
about my Nellie Forbush here,

28:18.914 --> 28:21.482
which sounds pornographic,
but really,

28:21.525 --> 28:23.919
it's just a character
from <i>South Pacific.</i>

28:23.963 --> 28:25.051
I'm sorry I missed it.

28:25.094 --> 28:27.662
-The minister has arrived!
-Ah.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.185
Finally. Where's Kirby?

28:29.229 --> 28:31.100
-She's not here yet?
-No.

28:31.144 --> 28:32.711
I knew it.

28:37.063 --> 28:39.152
Okay, okay.

28:39.195 --> 28:42.329
She said she's on her way.
Come on. It's almost showtime.

28:50.119 --> 28:52.643
So I suppose I should
congratulate you.

28:52.687 --> 28:54.167
Well, the mother of the bride

28:54.210 --> 28:56.865
<i>is</i> the second most
important person of the wedding.

28:56.909 --> 28:58.824
I was actually talking
about the rumor I heard

28:58.867 --> 29:00.608
you're the new owner
of Carrington Manor.

29:00.651 --> 29:02.392
It's not a rumor, and I'm sure

29:02.436 --> 29:04.873
you're wondering about
the status of your tenancy.

29:04.917 --> 29:06.527
Actually,

29:06.570 --> 29:07.833
I wanted to discuss ownership.

29:07.876 --> 29:09.399
I've recently discovered

29:09.443 --> 29:11.837
that my father left me
the mineral rights

29:11.880 --> 29:14.013
to the entire manor property.

29:14.056 --> 29:15.928
The mineral...?Rights.

29:15.971 --> 29:18.191
I can spell it for you
if you'd like.

29:18.234 --> 29:20.019
So while you may
own everything

29:20.062 --> 29:23.152
<i>on</i> the land,
I own everything underneath it.

29:23.196 --> 29:25.589
Unless, of course,
I sell the rights to Blake,

29:25.633 --> 29:29.637
which I think he'd be very
interested in buying now.

29:29.680 --> 29:31.508
-I'm sure he would.
-It's only right

29:31.552 --> 29:33.641
that I give you the
opportunity to bid first.

29:33.684 --> 29:38.515
I'm afraid I'm not particularly
liquid at the moment.

29:38.559 --> 29:42.737
I'm sure, as long as
we keep it between us,

29:42.781 --> 29:45.131
we can make arrangements.

29:45.174 --> 29:48.743
I get it. A little something
outside the box?

29:48.787 --> 29:52.486
Outside the box is where I live.

29:55.532 --> 29:56.969
Over here!

29:58.318 --> 29:59.972
I told you not
to tell anyone else!

30:00.015 --> 30:02.801
I think you have enough room
for one more guest.

30:04.411 --> 30:05.804
Oh! Perfect.

30:05.847 --> 30:07.196
Clearly, Kirby is lost,

30:07.240 --> 30:09.068
so you can be
-our witness.
-Wait.

30:09.111 --> 30:10.983
-You're getting married here?
-Yeah.

30:11.026 --> 30:12.854
I mean, it's as good
a place as any.

30:12.898 --> 30:14.943
So, let's get the show
on the road.

30:19.513 --> 30:22.124
Okay.

30:22.168 --> 30:27.347
Welcome, friends,
or, well, friend, technically.

30:27.390 --> 30:29.436
Anyway,

30:29.479 --> 30:31.090
it's great to be here.

30:31.133 --> 30:34.180
Fallon and Liam.
Liam and Fallon.

30:34.223 --> 30:39.141
These two have been
through a lot of ups and downs.

30:39.185 --> 30:40.969
But the one thing that...

30:43.015 --> 30:45.539
-Are you kidding?
-It's Ryan.

30:45.582 --> 30:48.455
Unless his last name is
"Gosling," do not answer.

30:48.498 --> 30:49.804
Well, tell him
you'll call him back.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.154
Okay.

30:52.198 --> 30:53.939
Hey.

30:53.982 --> 30:55.418
I've thought about it, and...

30:55.462 --> 30:57.551
I think
we should give this a try.

30:57.594 --> 30:58.813
Really?

30:58.857 --> 31:00.075
So do I.

31:00.119 --> 31:01.860
Just, uh, give
me five minutes

31:01.903 --> 31:03.122
to marry Fallon and Liam,

31:03.165 --> 31:04.819
and then we can talk
about it, okay?

31:04.863 --> 31:06.647
Uh, no, actually,

31:06.690 --> 31:08.910
listen to my speech. Hold this.

31:08.954 --> 31:11.695
-Uh, hi?
Hey.

31:11.739 --> 31:12.871
Can we get this
over with, please?

31:13.697 --> 31:15.438
So that we can live
happily ever after.

31:15.482 --> 31:18.485
-Okay.
-Look, the point is

31:18.528 --> 31:21.488
that even though
it seemed like a fluke,

31:21.531 --> 31:24.360
you two found each other.

31:25.144 --> 31:26.841
And it doesn't
matter when or why

31:26.885 --> 31:28.495
or under what
circumstance

31:28.538 --> 31:31.628
it took place, because if it
didn't happen the way it did,

31:31.672 --> 31:34.283
it would have happened
in some other crazy way.

31:34.327 --> 31:38.070
When something is meant to be,
it's meant to be.

31:38.113 --> 31:41.812
And it may take you five
months to realize it

31:41.856 --> 31:43.162
or five minutes.

31:43.205 --> 31:44.772
But it didn't take

31:44.815 --> 31:47.166
any of us very long

31:47.209 --> 31:50.256
to realize that you two
are the real thing.

31:50.299 --> 31:51.779
And now for the vows.

31:51.822 --> 31:53.563
Fallon?

31:53.607 --> 31:55.087
Liam,

31:55.130 --> 31:58.525
instead of regular,
old, boring vows,

31:58.568 --> 32:00.483
I wrote a song

32:00.527 --> 32:02.007
just for you.

32:02.050 --> 32:04.009
And all you have to do
is listen.

32:10.537 --> 32:13.018
♪ A courthouse in the rain

32:13.061 --> 32:15.629
♪ Where we begin

32:17.065 --> 32:19.850
♪ You had the chance
to walk away ♪

32:19.894 --> 32:22.244
♪ But you followed me in

32:23.550 --> 32:25.769
♪ I threw you into the fire

32:25.813 --> 32:28.337
♪ And you said it was fun

32:29.686 --> 32:32.820
♪ Should've moved on,
but you stayed ♪

32:32.863 --> 32:34.300
♪ When I told you to run

32:36.084 --> 32:40.001
♪ I was fine alone

32:40.045 --> 32:42.569
♪ But now I've found my home

32:42.612 --> 32:44.745
♪ It's you

32:44.788 --> 32:47.008
♪ And me

32:47.052 --> 32:50.011
♪ And finally

32:50.055 --> 32:52.796
♪ A man of my own way

32:52.840 --> 32:55.799
♪ And you're mine

32:55.843 --> 32:59.629
♪ Now I believe

32:59.673 --> 33:05.244
♪ Without a beat

33:05.287 --> 33:07.855
♪ 'Cause more than before

33:07.898 --> 33:11.685
♪ I love you more

33:12.816 --> 33:14.949
♪ More than before

33:14.993 --> 33:18.866
♪ I love you more

33:18.909 --> 33:21.086
♪ More than before

33:21.129 --> 33:26.352
♪ I love you more than me.

33:40.192 --> 33:41.497
Yeah!

33:41.541 --> 33:44.457
-Are you kidding?
No.

33:44.500 --> 33:48.113
You want me to read my regular,
old, boring vows after that?

33:48.156 --> 33:50.202
-Yeah.
-Okay.

33:50.245 --> 33:53.683
I will make one vow to you.

33:53.727 --> 33:55.772
To never let you go.

33:56.773 --> 33:58.253
Because when you find
the person that you want

33:58.297 --> 34:00.212
to be with forever,
you hold on tight.

34:00.255 --> 34:03.737
And you shout it
so everyone can hear.

34:03.780 --> 34:05.695
I love you,

34:05.739 --> 34:08.481
Fallon Carrington!

34:09.569 --> 34:12.093
I-I was, uh,
expecting hundreds

34:12.137 --> 34:13.747
to hear that. More of an impact.

34:13.790 --> 34:15.096
It's okay. I heard it.

34:15.140 --> 34:17.098
That's all I need.

34:17.925 --> 34:20.710
By the power vested in me

34:20.754 --> 34:23.191
by the Internet,

34:23.235 --> 34:25.193
I now pronounce you

34:25.237 --> 34:28.196
husband and wife.

34:28.240 --> 34:30.764
Kiss it out, kids.

34:44.908 --> 34:45.909
-Cristal.

34:45.953 --> 34:47.172
What are you...

34:47.215 --> 34:48.825
what are you doing here?

34:48.869 --> 34:50.958
Well, I didn't come to work out.

34:51.001 --> 34:52.655
I-I wanted

34:52.699 --> 34:55.745
to call. Um, I'm so sorry
about what happened last night.

34:55.789 --> 34:58.008
I... Cl-Clearly,
I ruined the wedding.

34:58.052 --> 34:59.488
You didn't ruin the wedding.

34:59.532 --> 35:01.055
Blake did.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.317
Though,

35:02.361 --> 35:04.232
you did ruin
the rehearsal dinner.

35:04.276 --> 35:07.409
Yeah. I should have walked away.

35:07.453 --> 35:09.846
Well, I'm glad you didn't.

35:10.630 --> 35:13.763
What does that mean?

35:13.807 --> 35:14.938
It means

35:14.982 --> 35:17.332
I'm still
a married woman...

35:18.551 --> 35:22.120
...but I'm just not sure
if I want to be anymore.

35:23.295 --> 35:24.426
I'll be there in a minute,
Shelly.

35:24.470 --> 35:26.080
As soon as I get this money.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.429
Things have gotten
a little trickier

35:27.473 --> 35:29.083
now that my sister
has disappeared.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.346
Just hang tight.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.920
Kirby? Kirby!

35:39.963 --> 35:42.575
Oh!

35:42.618 --> 35:44.751
Kirby. Kirby, can you hear me?

35:44.794 --> 35:47.406
My guess is they're
in a theater of some kind.

35:47.449 --> 35:49.625
Um, sounded like
a big, open space,

35:49.669 --> 35:52.498
and-and Liam mentioned something
about "production."

35:52.541 --> 35:55.501
So, uh, you know, unfortunately,
we haven't got a lot to go on.

35:55.544 --> 35:57.546
I'm trying to find Kirby,
see if she can help.

35:57.590 --> 35:59.287
Why would they go to a theater?

35:59.331 --> 36:02.638
Fallon hasn't been
in a theater since...

36:02.682 --> 36:05.424
Wait a minute,
I think I know where she is.

36:05.467 --> 36:06.860
So, pretty much how you pictured

36:06.903 --> 36:09.776
your, uh, third wedding
when you were a kid?

36:09.819 --> 36:11.691
Completely.

36:11.734 --> 36:13.780
Well, as long
as we're alone,

36:13.823 --> 36:15.782
maybe we should
consummate the marriage.

36:15.825 --> 36:18.828
You ever had sex on the stage
of your high school theater?

36:18.872 --> 36:20.395
Um,

36:20.439 --> 36:23.833
I don't think you really want me
to answer that question.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.532
No, no, no. Hey, what?

36:26.575 --> 36:28.838
Where are you going?
It was just once.

36:28.882 --> 36:30.449
Well, okay, it was twice.

36:30.492 --> 36:31.754
But it was with the same guy,

36:31.798 --> 36:33.669
so it was kind of like
an encore.

36:33.713 --> 36:36.455
Relax. I'm going to get
the champagne from the car.

36:36.498 --> 36:39.806
Oh, great. I'm sure
it's nice and warm by now.

36:56.388 --> 36:58.520
-Thank you.
You don't say goodbye now?

37:00.870 --> 37:03.133
Well, clearly,
this wedding isn't happening,

37:03.177 --> 37:06.833
-so I figured I'd go.
-Before you do,
can I ask you a question?

37:06.876 --> 37:08.008
Don't ask how,

37:08.051 --> 37:09.836
but I happen to own
the mineral rights

37:09.879 --> 37:12.230
to everything
underneath the manor.

37:12.273 --> 37:13.231
And?

37:13.274 --> 37:15.320
And there are rumored to be

37:15.363 --> 37:17.278
oodles of diamonds down there.

37:17.322 --> 37:18.714
And

37:18.758 --> 37:20.716
just because we aren't
partners anymore sexually

37:20.760 --> 37:24.503
doesn't mean we can't be
partners business-ly.

37:24.546 --> 37:25.895
Well, I do like diamonds.

37:25.939 --> 37:29.072
And knowing that we were
digging up the grounds

37:29.116 --> 37:31.379
would drive Blake insane.

37:32.728 --> 37:34.730
Whatever we find
we can split fifty-fifty.

37:34.774 --> 37:39.082
After I reimburse you
for the excavation, of course.

37:39.126 --> 37:42.085
Yeah, sure. Why not?

37:42.129 --> 37:44.131
Great. I'll be in touch.

37:44.174 --> 37:45.524
Maybe I'll be seeing you

37:45.567 --> 37:48.527
back around here
once in a while after all.

38:00.974 --> 38:02.062
He's in.

38:02.105 --> 38:04.282
I knew
he wouldn't be able to resist.

38:04.325 --> 38:06.719
He is his mother's son.

38:06.762 --> 38:09.025
-Don't let him hear you say that.
-True.

38:09.069 --> 38:10.853
If he finds out
I'm anywhere near this deal,

38:10.897 --> 38:13.203
he'll shut it down
before it begins.

38:13.247 --> 38:15.771
Don't worry. He has
no interest in living here.

38:15.815 --> 38:20.167
He won't know, and we'll be able
to get everything we want.

38:20.210 --> 38:22.300
To a new partnership.

38:22.343 --> 38:23.823
Foot off the gas, okay?

38:23.866 --> 38:26.042
We're not Thelma and Louise.

38:29.045 --> 38:30.612
Keep me informed.

38:30.656 --> 38:32.658
Take care of this, will you?

38:37.619 --> 38:40.143
Liam,
is the champagne at a boil?

38:40.187 --> 38:41.362
Evan?

38:41.406 --> 38:42.624
Liam!

38:42.668 --> 38:44.191
Liam, help!

38:44.234 --> 38:47.063
I'll use this if you
make one more sound.

38:47.107 --> 38:49.501
Don't move.

38:51.677 --> 38:54.680
I guess congratulations
are in order.

39:02.470 --> 39:05.212
Shelly? I'll be right back.

39:05.255 --> 39:09.042
Got to do some reconnaissance,
find out where Adam is.

39:10.565 --> 39:12.175
Evan, you don't have
to do this.

39:12.219 --> 39:13.699
Actually, I do.

39:13.742 --> 39:16.484
It's the least I could
do for my sister.

39:16.528 --> 39:19.095
Wait, this is about Trixie?

39:19.139 --> 39:20.967
But I already explained that
to you.

39:21.010 --> 39:22.490
It was an accident.
I'm so sorry.

39:22.534 --> 39:24.884
Yeah. Yes, when
we were dating.

39:24.927 --> 39:27.365
And what about
the two of us?

39:27.408 --> 39:30.063
You know, I thought we
had something special.

39:30.106 --> 39:31.543
Oh.

39:31.586 --> 39:35.198
I even kept a lock
of your hair.

39:35.242 --> 39:37.070
Okay.

39:37.113 --> 39:38.898
Well, I mean,

39:38.941 --> 39:43.424
I-I thought we had
something special, too.

39:43.468 --> 39:46.775
But then you rejected me
for Liam.

39:46.819 --> 39:48.908
But, you know, to be fair,

39:48.951 --> 39:51.258
Liam did have amnesia.

39:51.301 --> 39:53.086
More excuses!

39:53.129 --> 39:56.263
You know, I tried to open your
eyes by delaying the wedding.

39:56.306 --> 39:58.483
Tried to give you
one last chance to choose me.

39:58.526 --> 40:01.399
Maybe we can just talk.

40:04.576 --> 40:07.143
What the hell is going on here?

40:07.187 --> 40:09.319
You stay right there!

40:12.192 --> 40:14.063
-Kirby?
-I already called 911.

40:14.107 --> 40:15.282
You did this.

40:15.325 --> 40:17.066
No. No, it's not
what it looks like.

40:17.110 --> 40:18.633
If she dies,

40:18.677 --> 40:20.200
so do you.

40:20.243 --> 40:22.115
-Whoa, hey, hey, hey.
-I said don't move!
Either of you.

40:22.158 --> 40:24.160
Evan, Evan, Evan, Evan.

40:24.204 --> 40:27.468
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

40:28.948 --> 40:31.820
Okay? Um... I just, um...

40:31.864 --> 40:34.301
I'm just nervous.

40:34.344 --> 40:36.477
You know? I-I...

40:36.521 --> 40:39.306
I can't believe
there's an actual chance

40:39.349 --> 40:41.395
for us to be together.

40:42.527 --> 40:44.485
Don't lie to me, Fallon.

40:44.529 --> 40:47.575
I know exactly the type
of person you are.

40:47.619 --> 40:50.317
No, I'm not lying. Let's just...

40:50.360 --> 40:52.319
Please put down the knife,

40:52.362 --> 40:54.452
Evan, okay? And...

40:54.495 --> 40:57.498
And we can discuss this
