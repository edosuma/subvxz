this is just, like, Thursday.

I know it's stupid,
but I thought

26:33.291 --> 26:34.917
maybe he'd read it tonight.

Better he reads it

when he writes.

Should we text him?

It just makes us
seem so needy.

27:03.417 --> 27:04.667
- We are needy.
- I know.

But it's too pathetic.

Well, you don't know.

He's like a goldfish.

The minute we leave
his field of vision,

27:16.667 --> 27:17.625
he forgets we exist.

27:17.625 --> 27:21.166
So maybe a text
to nudge him a bit?

"you inconsiderate fucker,"

He wants his name off it,
