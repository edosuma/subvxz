00:32.520 --> 00:34.420
Bobby, honey, don't worry.

00:34.522 --> 00:38.754
Going to your grandmother's
for your birthday is gonna be great!

00:39.193 --> 00:41.354
Let's just get this over with.

00:41.462 --> 00:44.488
What's the matter?
Aren't you excited to fly to Arizona?

00:44.599 --> 00:46.590
They got the Grand Canyon there.

00:46.701 --> 00:48.635
Of course, you won't be seeing it, but...

00:48.736 --> 00:53.105
No. Because Grandma thinks,
"Baby Bobby might fall in."

00:53.374 --> 00:57.572
And anyway, she's got coloring books
of the Grand Canyon.

00:58.679 --> 01:01.546
[Singing] This old man came rolling home

01:03.184 --> 01:06.210
This is my place, Bobby.
Home sweet home.

01:06.621 --> 01:10.990
Building 42, living space K,
in case we get separated.

01:13.594 --> 01:16.722
I know your birthday's
not for another few days...

01:16.831 --> 01:19.026
but I'm no good at keeping secrets.

01:19.133 --> 01:20.623
Happy birthday.

01:23.404 --> 01:25.531
BOBBY: A policeman's uniform.

01:26.107 --> 01:28.473
"Ages seven and up."

01:28.576 --> 01:31.977
Tillie, Bobby isn't seven years old.

01:32.179 --> 01:33.976
He's what, nine? Ten?

01:34.115 --> 01:35.980
I'll be 13 next week.

01:36.083 --> 01:38.745
Thirteen? You know, in my religion...

01:38.853 --> 01:41.879
13 is your official passage into manhood.

01:42.156 --> 01:45.216
It's called a bar mitzvah or "big party."

01:45.459 --> 01:49.190
- Is that an Arizona thing?
- Arizona, New York, Miami.

01:49.630 --> 01:54.090
I got so many fancy pen-and-pencil sets,
I was giving them away for years.

01:54.235 --> 01:55.964
Pen-and-pencil set?

01:56.370 --> 01:59.897
That is very manly.
Can I get a bar mitzvah?

02:00.207 --> 02:02.573
I'm willing to celebrate Hanukkah.

02:02.677 --> 02:06.113
Trust me, it's more work
than you're gonna wanna put in.

02:06.213 --> 02:09.306
I'll tell you what.
Tomorrow, you spend the day with me...

02:09.417 --> 02:12.079
and I'll show you
how a man enjoys Arizona.

02:12.186 --> 02:15.553
By the time you leave here,
you'll have hair on your kishkas.

02:16.957 --> 02:18.788
What you making, Hank?

02:18.893 --> 02:21.384
Hey, Bill. I'm making a coffin.

02:21.562 --> 02:23.086
- A coffin?
- Yep.

02:23.197 --> 02:26.655
I was talking to a client the other day
about forest fires...

02:26.767 --> 02:30.897
and I can't remember exactly
how the conversation turned to coffins.

02:31.305 --> 02:34.172
But, well, long story short, I got the bug.

02:34.608 --> 02:35.973
Looks nice.

02:38.012 --> 02:39.980
This is my bachelor pad.

02:40.214 --> 02:43.206
And for the next week,
because you're so old...

02:43.317 --> 02:46.809
- it's your bachelor pad.
- My own pad.

02:49.890 --> 02:52.188
I wish my girlfriend was here.

02:52.293 --> 02:54.488
She really likes to sit up.

02:55.429 --> 02:59.195
- So you got yourself a girlfriend?
- Yeah. She's on the left.

03:00.034 --> 03:03.800
- She's a little slip of a thing.
- She's got her period already.

03:04.438 --> 03:06.929
Give it 50 years, it'll go away.

03:07.074 --> 03:08.541
Who's the guy?

03:08.642 --> 03:12.806
That's my best friend, Joseph.
He won't be 13 for a few months.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.942
Well, feel free
to give your little friend a call.

03:16.050 --> 03:17.813
I'll give you some privacy.

03:18.419 --> 03:20.649
I almost forgot. Use my cart.

03:28.095 --> 03:30.620
Count Dracula has thousands of coffins.

03:30.731 --> 03:33.461
They say he sleeps in a different coffin
every night.

03:33.567 --> 03:35.831
I don't know if it's true.
It's just what I heard.

03:35.936 --> 03:37.301
It sounds true.

03:37.404 --> 03:39.964
No, it sounds made-up. I don't know.

03:40.274 --> 03:41.901
Okay. That should do it.

03:43.477 --> 03:45.468
That is a terrible coffin.

04:08.803 --> 04:12.899
Mr. O'Connor, I'm Bobby Hill.
I live next door to you.

04:13.073 --> 04:17.533
I'm having some people over
tomorrow night, eightish to whenever.

04:17.778 --> 04:21.043
- What can I bring?
- Your appetite and your wife.

04:21.214 --> 04:24.651
And some potato salad
if she brings her appetite.

04:25.853 --> 04:28.822
Honey, do you want butter beans
or Lima beans?

04:28.956 --> 04:30.719
Are you building a coffin?

04:30.825 --> 04:33.760
Yep. One for me and one for you.

04:40.401 --> 04:43.268
Hank, why doesn't the lid on mine
close all the way?

04:45.039 --> 04:47.599
It does. I mean, it almost closes.

04:47.708 --> 04:51.007
- I'll make sure it closes come the big day.
- No, Hank.

04:51.111 --> 04:52.544
You will build me a new one.

04:52.646 --> 04:56.514
Because if you try to stick
the late Peggy Hill in an inferior casket...

04:56.617 --> 04:59.814
she will come back to haunt you.
I will see to it.

05:06.794 --> 05:08.557
"To Mr. Bobby Hill."

05:11.465 --> 05:14.229
Yes! Today I am a man!

05:20.140 --> 05:23.803
You know, Joseph is also coming home
today from summer camp.

05:23.911 --> 05:25.936
So I thought we'd all go out to dinner.

05:26.046 --> 05:28.514
We're meeting the Gribbles
over at Rattlesnake's.

05:28.616 --> 05:31.278
That's nice. Joseph's a good kid.

05:31.652 --> 05:34.280
I'm planning on taking him
under my wing...

05:34.388 --> 05:35.855
like Garry did with me.

05:46.634 --> 05:49.330
- Joseph?
- Hey, Bobby.

05:50.738 --> 05:55.402
So, did you grow mostly in a few nights
or evenly throughout the summer?

05:55.976 --> 05:57.136
I don't know.

05:57.244 --> 06:00.008
Hi, I'm Jennifer. How is everyone tonight?

06:00.114 --> 06:02.639
Jennifer, we're fantastic!

06:02.883 --> 06:05.147
Can I start you out
with something to drink?

06:06.620 --> 06:10.078
No. I'll take the other menu
like my young friend.

06:10.190 --> 06:11.555
Thank you, Jennifer.

06:11.659 --> 06:15.493
Bobby, order off the kid's menu
while you still can. It's cheaper.

06:15.596 --> 06:17.427
- I'll have beer.
- Beer.

06:17.564 --> 06:19.327
Beer, Jennifer!

06:20.634 --> 06:22.864
- Let me guess. Beer.
- Who?

06:22.970 --> 06:24.198
- What? Me?
- Him?

06:24.305 --> 06:25.795
So, can you believe it?

06:25.906 --> 06:27.737
He must have put six inches on him.

06:27.841 --> 06:30.435
Can you believe it? Hank, can you?

06:31.078 --> 06:34.275
- Peggy, can you believe it?
- Well, I have to, Dale.

06:34.381 --> 06:38.147
- I see Joseph right here.
- You got to see it to believe it.

06:38.552 --> 06:41.180
- Well put.
- I could take your order now.

06:41.288 --> 06:42.755
- Chicken!
- Sir?

06:43.123 --> 06:44.886
- Chicken.
- Okay.

06:45.326 --> 06:46.350
Son?

06:47.861 --> 06:49.226
The chicken, please.

06:49.330 --> 06:53.426
Is that the Chicken Wing Dings
or the Choo Choo Chicken Fingers?

06:59.073 --> 07:00.404
Choo Choo.

07:04.845 --> 07:07.313
Well, how's my little birthday man?

07:07.414 --> 07:10.212
- You notice I said "man."
- You also said "little."

07:10.317 --> 07:12.717
Bobby, honey,
I know you want an adult party.

07:12.820 --> 07:16.312
And what you need
is a professional disc jockey.

07:16.423 --> 07:20.689
So, guess where I was
from 3:10 until 5:00 today?

07:21.128 --> 07:22.595
The Learning Annex.

07:22.696 --> 07:25.392
DJ Spaz taught me
how to really turn it out.

07:25.499 --> 07:26.989
- Mom...
- I learned how to scratch.

07:27.101 --> 07:29.626
- No.
- And cut and wipe...

07:29.737 --> 07:34.436
I was kind of hoping that you and Dad
would stay in the garage during the party.

07:35.576 --> 07:38.773
But I have carried the cake in
12 years in a row.

07:40.514 --> 07:41.811
All right.

07:43.083 --> 07:45.813
It's your father, isn't it?
You know, he will be fine...

07:45.919 --> 07:47.716
- if you only want me there, honey...
- Mom!

07:47.821 --> 07:51.985
Very well. Let's get your first big mistake
as a teenager out of the way.

07:55.629 --> 07:56.994
Hey, Joseph.

07:57.097 --> 08:00.430
My mom said I could have
a six-foot sub for my party.

08:00.768 --> 08:03.328
I could use a little help taste-testing.

08:03.437 --> 08:08.340
I don't have time for this, Bobby.
I've got a lot of important stuff to stow.

08:08.642 --> 08:10.667
It's my 13th birthday.

08:11.045 --> 08:15.106
And if you want me to sneak you
into any PG-13 movies...

08:15.349 --> 08:18.341
you had better get on your bike
and help me eat subs!

08:18.452 --> 08:19.680
I said no.

08:20.721 --> 08:24.157
BOBBY: So then I asked Joseph
if he wanted to go riding bikes.

08:24.258 --> 08:25.589
And he was all:

08:25.692 --> 08:28.991
"No. I got some things to do
around the house."

08:29.496 --> 08:32.431
What's with that? He went to kids' camp.

08:32.533 --> 08:36.832
I'm the one who just spent a week
in a retirement community.

08:36.937 --> 08:38.131
You know, Bobby...

08:38.238 --> 08:41.674
there are some days of the month
that I don't like to ride a bike either.

08:41.775 --> 08:43.743
You mean because you got your period?

08:43.844 --> 08:46.472
- I chose not to use that word.
- Why?

08:46.880 --> 08:50.247
- It's a natural, beautiful thing.
- You don't understand.

08:50.350 --> 08:51.612
You're not there yet.

08:51.718 --> 08:54.050
You had better check the map, honey!

08:54.154 --> 08:57.021
Because I am living in downtown there!

09:05.432 --> 09:08.959
So, fixing up your bike to sell it?

09:09.870 --> 09:14.307
I guess you'll be getting a motorcycle
or a Town Car or something.

09:14.408 --> 09:15.875
[Joseph grunts]

09:17.177 --> 09:20.613
Yeah. Well, here's an invitation
for my birthday party.

09:20.814 --> 09:23.749
There's gonna be a lot of stuff
you'll like there.

09:23.851 --> 09:27.844
- You know, grown-up stuff like dancing.
- Dancing?

09:28.455 --> 09:30.218
No, I don't think so.

09:35.696 --> 09:40.633
What is so funny, Mr. Five-Feet-Ten-Inches
with your fancy armpit hair?

09:40.734 --> 09:42.258
I'm guessing.

09:45.105 --> 09:47.232
Joseph, what's going on?

09:48.008 --> 09:51.341
- I can't dance.
- Compared to me, no.

09:52.012 --> 09:55.675
I've got stretch marks on my shoulders
and zits on my back.

09:56.583 --> 09:58.915
I can't even ride my own bike anymore!

09:59.353 --> 10:03.221
And a million times a day my dad asks me,
"How's the weather up there?"

10:03.323 --> 10:06.121
Tell him it's fair to partly stupid.

10:07.561 --> 10:10.962
Man, you always know just what to say.

10:11.865 --> 10:14.231
That's why you have a girlfriend.

10:14.568 --> 10:16.297
Yeah, I do, don't I?

10:16.403 --> 10:19.133
I want a girl, too! Oh, God!

10:19.239 --> 10:21.503
I just can't stop thinking about them!

10:21.608 --> 10:25.203
I can't get girls out of my head!
I just... Just get out!

10:26.180 --> 10:29.980
Come on, Joseph. I told Charise
you were coming to my party...

10:30.083 --> 10:32.176
and she didn't turn me down.

10:32.286 --> 10:34.618
I bet she grew this summer, too.

10:35.422 --> 10:38.289
And she's always been really tall.

10:40.360 --> 10:42.988
- I didn't know you sewed, Hank.
- Sewer!

10:43.530 --> 10:45.191
I am not sewing.

10:45.299 --> 10:49.258
I am upholstering, which is
one of the five original industrial arts.

10:49.369 --> 10:51.462
Whatever you say, Aunt Bee.

10:51.605 --> 10:55.041
While you're at it, maybe you can quilt
one of them coffins for me.

10:55.142 --> 10:58.509
It's only a matter of time
before Joseph's hormonal rage...

10:58.612 --> 11:02.013
forces him to kill me in my sleep
and marry my mother.

11:02.749 --> 11:05.115
Anyhoo,
are you gonna button-tuck the folds?

11:05.219 --> 11:07.380
Yeah, man. You know,
needle got a lot of better ways...

11:07.487 --> 11:09.455
in them dang old...
Button-tucking them folds?

11:11.658 --> 11:12.989
[Contemporary pop music playing
on stereo]

11:13.093 --> 11:16.187
Well, I won't be able
to blow out my candles...

11:16.296 --> 11:19.288
because you just took my breath away.

11:19.833 --> 11:21.698
Happy birthday, Bobby.

11:23.904 --> 11:26.395
Have you girls seen the new Joseph?

11:27.241 --> 11:29.072
Hey, Alexis. Hi, Stacy.

11:34.147 --> 11:37.116
Oh, Hank. I have carried in
Bobby's birthday cake...

11:37.217 --> 11:39.378
for every one of his birthdays.

11:39.486 --> 11:42.421
I am the Cal Ripken of birthday cakes.

11:42.689 --> 11:43.883
Now look at me.

11:43.991 --> 11:47.358
Banished to the garage while
Bobby's party goes on without me...

11:47.461 --> 11:49.156
or a decent mix tape.

11:49.263 --> 11:51.857
Hey, let's start a new tradition
for Bobby's birthday.

11:51.965 --> 11:54.456
What do you say
you and me just cut loose?

11:56.503 --> 11:58.403
And I ordered pizza.

12:00.207 --> 12:02.471
Come on. I want to show you something.

12:05.545 --> 12:06.807
Feel that.

12:07.914 --> 12:09.381
It's so plush.

12:09.483 --> 12:13.112
Well, it better be.
It's silk stuffed with Canadian goose down.

12:13.220 --> 12:14.915
See, I made yours better than mine.

12:15.022 --> 12:18.924
Mine's just fiberfill left over
from when we insulated the attic.

12:27.067 --> 12:30.264
Oh, Hank.
It's like sleeping on a marshmallow.

12:38.011 --> 12:40.639
Come on, J! Help me bust a move.

12:53.293 --> 12:56.160
Sorry. I just... Sorry.

12:59.099 --> 13:01.033
What are you staring at, weirdo?

13:10.077 --> 13:14.013
Where are you going?
I totally hooked you up with Charise.

13:14.114 --> 13:18.346
- Why didn't you put the moves on her?
- I don't have any moves, Bobby.

13:18.685 --> 13:21.950
Okay. I like working with a clean slate.

13:22.956 --> 13:25.288
Come learn moves from the master.

13:28.729 --> 13:33.166
As promised, I present to you the VIP sub.

13:36.903 --> 13:39.838
Hey, your hands are really soft.

13:39.973 --> 13:41.531
I have a new soap.

13:41.641 --> 13:45.236
Well, you must be using it
on your face, too...

13:45.345 --> 13:48.041
because your skin is beautiful.

13:48.281 --> 13:51.717
What are you talking about?
My face is all broken out.

13:52.519 --> 13:55.955
- Hey, did you kiss me today?
- What?

13:56.123 --> 13:57.283
Enjoy.

14:01.194 --> 14:03.856
Bobby! Joseph is right here!

14:03.964 --> 14:06.194
So? Maybe he'll learn something.

14:06.299 --> 14:08.665
Bobby, you did this
so Joseph could watch?

14:08.769 --> 14:10.202
You're such a creep!

14:10.303 --> 14:11.270
Oops.

14:11.371 --> 14:12.861
Time of the month.

14:13.774 --> 14:16.334
Hey, don't blame you being a jerk on my...

14:16.810 --> 14:19.142
Which I'm not about to talk
to either of you about...

14:19.246 --> 14:22.044
and which I am not even having anyway
because of track!

14:27.187 --> 14:29.052
Joseph likes to watch.

14:30.390 --> 14:31.379
[Knock on door]

14:31.491 --> 14:33.425
Use doorbell, you idiot!

14:35.095 --> 14:36.892
Connie, it's for you.

14:37.264 --> 14:39.391
If it's Bobby, slam the door in his face!

14:39.499 --> 14:43.526
I wish it was so I could.
But it just Jolly Gribble Giant.

14:43.737 --> 14:46.729
What is it now? Did you come here
to watch me do my homework?

14:46.840 --> 14:49.308
I just wanted to say it was all my fault.

14:49.409 --> 14:52.469
I mean, Bobby did it to help me 'cause...

14:52.913 --> 14:55.643
I'm such a... Oh, man!

14:56.082 --> 14:58.482
I'm not good with girls.

14:59.519 --> 15:01.749
You can't be any worse than Bobby.

15:01.855 --> 15:04.085
The way he tried to kiss me in front of...

15:04.191 --> 15:06.853
- Well, you were there.
- Anyways, I'm sorry.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.393
So, see you. Bye.

15:08.495 --> 15:09.689
Ow!

15:09.796 --> 15:10.956
Idiot!

15:12.199 --> 15:14.895
No, you're not.
I don't think you're an idiot.

15:23.210 --> 15:27.271
Connie, I rehearsed an apology.
But I'm gonna throw it away...

15:27.380 --> 15:31.009
because nothing says "I'm sorry"
like "I'm sorry."

15:31.852 --> 15:34.480
Connie, I rehearsed an apology. But...

15:45.499 --> 15:46.966
[Bobby and Joseph grunt]

15:47.167 --> 15:48.964
Bobby, are you okay?

15:50.871 --> 15:52.304
- Ow!
- Bobby!

15:52.706 --> 15:55.937
If my hand didn't hurt so much,
I'd do it again.

15:56.276 --> 15:57.903
What the hell?

15:58.545 --> 15:59.739
CONNIE: Stop it!

16:00.580 --> 16:02.047
I'm bleeding!

16:02.816 --> 16:05.410
Oh, look at you. You grow like bamboo.

16:05.785 --> 16:09.414
- Hey, what happened to his nose?
- I took care of business.

16:09.623 --> 16:11.250
Me and my hammer.

16:11.491 --> 16:16.019
We'd better get some ice on that before
you bleed all over the hand-loomed killer.

16:17.130 --> 16:20.657
- What were you doing, Connie?
- I don't know. It just...

16:22.102 --> 16:24.502
I think you'd better calm down.

16:25.405 --> 16:27.339
How can I calm down?

16:27.674 --> 16:32.168
You were kissing Joseph!
You are not allowed to kiss Joseph!

16:32.312 --> 16:34.837
I can kiss whoever I want, Bobby.

16:35.248 --> 16:38.706
So I guess you're dating Joseph now,
is that it?

16:38.818 --> 16:41.787
Well, maybe I wanted to kiss a guy
with a mustache.

16:41.888 --> 16:43.879
And maybe I didn't want to wait for you.

16:43.990 --> 16:46.458
What? I made you!

16:46.760 --> 16:50.662
You were just a dumb "A" student
until I hit the scene!

16:50.830 --> 16:53.993
Why would you... I just don't...
That does it!

16:54.367 --> 16:56.426
I am breaking up with you.

16:59.706 --> 17:01.435
[Bobby grunts]

17:04.978 --> 17:07.571
Oh, that's right. You blew it!

17:07.948 --> 17:09.074
Jerk!

17:09.883 --> 17:10.906
[Bobby exclaims]

17:11.017 --> 17:13.849
That little hillbilly pack quite a wallop.

17:14.954 --> 17:18.185
- You want some naproxen?
- No, I'm okay.

17:18.391 --> 17:22.885
How did tall, dark, and handsome
get butt-kicked by short, fat, and redneck?

17:25.932 --> 17:27.661
[Romantic instrumental music]

17:34.507 --> 17:37.067
Joseph. What's going on?

17:37.177 --> 17:40.544
Oh, you so cute.
Kahn gonna get a big kick out of this.

17:40.647 --> 17:42.842
Joseph, how could you?

17:44.618 --> 17:46.142
Sorry. I just...

17:46.653 --> 17:48.450
I thought you liked me.

17:48.722 --> 17:50.986
Oh, yeah. You rock my world.

17:59.699 --> 18:01.189
What the...

18:08.775 --> 18:11.335
Something at the party
must have upset Joseph.

18:11.444 --> 18:13.844
You know, it's an awkward age...

18:13.947 --> 18:16.074
what with acne and whatnot.

18:16.783 --> 18:19.650
You think I should get out of my coffin
and see what's going on?

18:19.753 --> 18:21.516
Over my dead body.

18:24.958 --> 18:27.927
I'm sure they're fine. Pass the chips.

18:29.929 --> 18:32.659
Hey, Joseph. How's the weather up there?

18:35.402 --> 18:36.494
That's it!

19:00.160 --> 19:02.094
What are you doing here?

19:02.195 --> 19:04.925
I came to apologize
and make out with tongues.

19:05.031 --> 19:07.090
I don't know where your tongue's been.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.929
Oh, wait. Yes, I do.

19:09.102 --> 19:12.162
I didn't mean to kiss Joseph.
It was just that...

19:12.639 --> 19:15.540
He was so sad and tall.

19:15.642 --> 19:18.509
And you're so loose and cheap.

19:22.315 --> 19:23.976
Connie, wait!

19:28.955 --> 19:30.547
Where are you going?

19:30.657 --> 19:32.488
I'm going as far as...

19:32.592 --> 19:35.527
an eighth of a tank of gas'll get me.

19:35.628 --> 19:37.220
Take me with you.

19:40.400 --> 19:42.891
What are you doing with my woman?

19:43.002 --> 19:45.664
- I'm not your property!
- Leave us alone.

19:51.311 --> 19:54.712
I said I was sorry. So let's do tongues now.

19:54.814 --> 19:57.146
- You're going to French?
- No way!

19:57.550 --> 19:59.381
- You said.
- I did not!

20:18.705 --> 20:20.263
DALE: Oh, no!

20:23.309 --> 20:25.368
My Bug-a-Bago!

20:25.912 --> 20:30.008
What evil hath been wrought
to befall this upon me?

20:31.818 --> 20:33.342
Who did this?

20:33.453 --> 20:37.048
- I don't know, Dale.
- Was it you?

20:41.594 --> 20:43.858
Let me... I wanna...

20:43.963 --> 20:47.490
Calm down, Dale.
Maybe one of these kids saw something.

20:47.801 --> 20:50.269
Bobby, did you see who did this?

20:54.541 --> 20:57.169
It was probably teenagers.

20:59.412 --> 21:02.279
- Yep. Teenagers.
- Teenagers.

21:02.782 --> 21:04.477
Damn teenagers!

21:10.790 --> 21:12.917
I guess you're off the hook.

21:13.026 --> 21:15.324
But don't leave town.

21:21.234 --> 21:23.225
Who wants birthday cake?

21:24.204 --> 21:27.264
Yes! Thirteen for 13!

21:28.174 --> 21:29.869
In your face, boy!

21:31.044 --> 21:33.740
[Rapping] Hey, Bobby, it's your birthday

21:34.981 --> 21:38.610
That's right, I served you cake
I'm Peggy, pull your leggy

21:38.718 --> 21:41.243
Oh, Bobby, let's go
Say what?

21:41.354 --> 21:43.982
That's right
I'm all that, I'm Peggy!

21:45.491 --> 21:46.685
Get funky

22:26.032 --> 22:28.523
DALE: Jennifer, we're fantastic!
