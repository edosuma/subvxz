he had like a wicked scar,

00:59.200 --> 01:00.804
He was kind of dark and mysterious,

01:00.880 --> 01:02.723
and my relationship

there's another guy in the room

kill Hector, you know?

01:44.800 --> 01:47.041
Yes, I have a family practise.

10:49.320 --> 10:50.651
<i>New...</i>

10:54.920 --> 10:56.843
<i>Accessories.</i> (CHUCKLES)

10:57.920 --> 10:59.160
Wha... What's this book say then?

10:59.440 --> 11:00.771
My... My book.

11:00.840 --> 11:02.604
<i>But your father didn't
leave it for you, did he?</i>

11:02.760 --> 11:05.081
<i>He killed himself instead
and left it for Kira.</i>

11:05.240 --> 11:07.129
So we would cooperate.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.886
<i>She thinks Delphine
is going to eliminate her.</i>

11:12.560 --> 11:13.846
<i>I translate...</i>

11:15.120 --> 11:17.441
- Book.
- My... My book

11:18.800 --> 11:21.326
and you take me out of here.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.807
She wants a quiet life

11:28.000 --> 11:29.365
in Taiwan.

11:29.680 --> 11:32.001
You can't disappear twice, can you?

11:32.200 --> 11:33.964
Dead women don't pass customs.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.083
Krystal Goderich.

11:36.520 --> 11:37.806
SCOTT: <i>Who's that?</i>

11:39.080 --> 11:41.048
She's LEDA, isn't she, Rachel?

11:41.120 --> 11:42.121
The one that CASTOR was after.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.451
Yes. Her monitor is...

11:47.440 --> 11:49.488
- Dead.
- Get me ID.

11:50.080 --> 11:53.448
<i>So you want me to steal Krystal's
identity and get you out of Dyad?</i>

11:53.960 --> 11:55.166
- Yes.
- (SARAH SCOFFS)

11:56.240 --> 11:58.208
How do I know you can even
read that book?

12:01.040 --> 12:02.849
She translated the page I gave her.

12:03.720 --> 12:05.529
What's it say, then? Are we in it?

12:06.080 --> 12:08.401
No. It's a...

12:09.320 --> 12:10.367
...nursery rhyme.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.651
"In London town we all fell down..."

12:14.120 --> 12:16.088
And Castor woke from slumber.

12:18.960 --> 12:20.041
Castor.

12:21.880 --> 12:24.645
We need to know what's inside that
book, that's the end of it.

12:27.160 --> 12:28.161
Hello.

12:28.720 --> 12:29.721
Oh, hello, love.

12:30.520 --> 12:32.045
Would you, um, grab your things,

12:32.120 --> 12:34.441
and we'll head over
to the Hendrix's, all right?

12:38.200 --> 12:40.089
You want to free Rachel

12:40.160 --> 12:42.606
over a nursery rhyme coded 'm
<i>Dr Moreau</i> about CASTOR.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.764
That's one page of it, S.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.889
There's got to be
something about us in there,

12:46.960 --> 12:48.246
and it could save Cosima.

12:48.320 --> 12:52.405
Or Duncan could be off his rocker,
or Rachel could be full of shite.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.720
There's only one way to know!

12:54.400 --> 12:57.085
Scott says he and Cosima
can get Rachel out of Dyad.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.368
- How?
- Something to do with his gaming group.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.489
- (SCOFFS)
- SARAH: Okay, good,

13:01.560 --> 13:03.403
so Krystal is 350 kilometres away.

13:03.680 --> 13:06.331
We leave right now
and we can be back by tonight.

13:06.480 --> 13:09.165
Whoa! Did I just get
seconded into this shit?

13:09.240 --> 13:10.605
If you spring Rachel from Dyad,

13:10.680 --> 13:13.729
you will destroy this alliance
with Delphine.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.609
She's the only person standing
between you and Topside.

13:15.680 --> 13:17.762
I don't give a shit
if Delphine's pissed off!

13:17.840 --> 13:20.650
We'll know what it says,
and she'll have to work with us.

13:20.840 --> 13:21.921
All right, give him the keys.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.401
The book might only be about CASTOR.

13:24.920 --> 13:26.160
Why bring it into play?

13:26.480 --> 13:27.925
The CASTOR boys are mayflies.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.082
I'm not gonna sit on my hands
and wait for them to die, S.

13:30.760 --> 13:32.125
Is Mark a mayfly to you?

13:35.480 --> 13:36.766
Sorry, Gracie.

13:38.360 --> 13:41.284
For what it's worth,
he was different from the rest of them.

13:43.400 --> 13:45.721
I'll, um... I'll walk you
to the bus, love.

13:51.480 --> 13:54.086
FELIX: If we're gonna go road-tripping
to steal some poor clone's identity,

13:54.160 --> 13:56.766
then I've only got one demand,
I get to choose the music.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.409
COSIMA: Chill zone over here.
SHAY: Very nice. (LAUGHS)

13:59.480 --> 14:01.721
Um, protein modelling server,
over there.

14:01.800 --> 14:02.801
Mmm-hmm.

14:02.880 --> 14:06.282
As I'm sure you're aware,
uh, fumigation hood for...

14:06.840 --> 14:08.842
- (SHAY MUMBLING)
- A little of that.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.206
- Oh, and Scott.
- Hi.

14:10.360 --> 14:11.441
SHAY: Hi, Scott.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.131
He... He loves lesbians.

14:13.400 --> 14:14.925
- SHAY: Oh, he does?
- Well, I...

14:17.080 --> 14:18.605
Can I sequence your genome?

14:19.200 --> 14:20.804
Uh, thank you.

14:21.320 --> 14:25.291
Um, but I draw the line at sharing
that information with a corporation.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.048
- (WHISPERING) She's smart.
- Seriously, right?

14:30.000 --> 14:31.729
- SCOTT: You got my text?
- Yeah.

14:33.320 --> 14:35.129
And if Sarah's ready, then I'm ready.

14:36.280 --> 14:37.850
Dude, you rock Room <i>Wars?</i>
I play this game

14:37.920 --> 14:39.331
- with my brothers all the time.
- SCOTT: Really?

14:39.400 --> 14:41.482
- Yeah.
- Cosima shreds at it.

14:41.560 --> 14:43.324
I've got a gaming group,
bit of a sausage fest,

14:43.400 --> 14:44.811
- but maybe you'd like to...
- Oh, wow.

14:45.520 --> 14:47.522
<i>Dr Moreau.</i> I love this book.

14:47.720 --> 14:48.721
Sorry. Um...

14:52.680 --> 14:54.523
Scott's really anal about his stuff.

14:54.680 --> 14:56.011
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

14:59.320 --> 15:00.731
Hello again, Shay.

15:01.280 --> 15:02.930
Uh, I got her a visitor pass, so...

15:03.000 --> 15:04.411
Cosima was just showing me around.

15:04.560 --> 15:06.289
It's fine. Um...

15:06.920 --> 15:08.331
But I need to speak with you.

15:08.920 --> 15:09.921
Okay.

15:10.880 --> 15:12.689
- I'll go, babe.
- No! No, no, no. No.

15:12.920 --> 15:14.331
Stay. You don't have to go.

15:14.760 --> 15:15.761
It's all good.

15:15.840 --> 15:18.571
All right, then. This is about
the sequencing issue

15:18.640 --> 15:20.847
we have with the European trials.

15:22.360 --> 15:25.523
Okay. Yeah, it's work stuff. Sorry.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.170
SHAY: Work, work, work.
COSIMA: Yeah.

15:29.480 --> 15:30.845
SCOTT: I'll show her out.

15:35.400 --> 15:38.085
You know, my security concerns,
they're not jealousy.

15:38.840 --> 15:40.968
I'm French. We enjoy lovers.

15:41.640 --> 15:42.641
Wow. Okay.

15:42.880 --> 15:46.441
Look, can we just put our minds together
like we used to

15:46.880 --> 15:48.291
and leave the crazy science out of it?

15:50.080 --> 15:51.081
- Sure.
- Good.

15:51.680 --> 15:55.730
Because this isn't good news.

16:03.360 --> 16:06.807
It can get pretty thick, so you really
gotta put your back into it.

16:07.120 --> 16:08.565
Sestra Alison has good taste.

16:08.840 --> 16:10.410
- Yea h, well, she's very crafty.
- In men.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.165
Wha... What?

16:13.680 --> 16:15.648
You have meat on your bones.

16:15.880 --> 16:17.803
You're strong like baby ox.

16:18.280 --> 16:19.281
This I like.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.121
It's not usually
this thick when Ali does it.

16:25.520 --> 16:27.170
(IN RUSSIAN ACCENT)
So maybe we need two baby ox.

16:27.640 --> 16:28.801
(LAUGHING)

16:34.520 --> 16:36.010
You are funny man, Donnie Hendrix.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.368
- (LAUGHING)
- That's very kind of you.

16:40.480 --> 16:43.484
Why don't you try it, okay?
Be very careful, it's hot.

16:44.560 --> 16:45.925
I gotta talk to my wife.

16:46.240 --> 16:47.401
Two babies.

finish talking about this.

I... You've made me lose my place.

16:58.040 --> 16:59.280
What? Helena's fine.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.010
It's not Helena.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.050
Jason Kellerman kissed you.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.010
Donnie, he kissed Cosima.

17:05.079 --> 17:06.127
He thought it was you.

17:06.200 --> 17:07.884
- It wasn't me.
- He thought it was.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.928
And maybe you would have
kissed him back.

17:12.520 --> 17:13.601
Donnie, this is...

17:15.079 --> 17:16.763
I'll talk to him. I'll talk to him.

17:16.960 --> 17:19.724
I'll clear this up so that he's no
longer under whatever misconception

17:19.800 --> 17:21.086
he's labouring under...

17:21.400 --> 17:22.845
GRACIE: Have a nice day.

17:23.440 --> 17:25.044
Look who's here. (CLEARS THROAT)

17:28.640 --> 17:30.130
Are you ready for your first big day?

17:54.680 --> 17:55.681
So do you.

17:57.200 --> 17:58.201
Helena, I'm...

17:59.600 --> 18:01.409
I'm sorry I lost our baby.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.131
It's not your fault.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.963
You will be aunty to my baby,

18:09.040 --> 18:10.041
Yes?

18:10.600 --> 18:11.647
I would like that.

18:12.400 --> 18:13.606
Thank you.

FELIX: just think, Sarah,

18:36.280 --> 18:38.601
had you finished high school
that could've been you.

18:40.680 --> 18:42.762
So this is a simple
identity theft, yeah?

18:42.840 --> 18:46.640
We need to get her ID
and her accounts to Rachel.

18:46.720 --> 18:47.721
So just get her wallet.

18:48.280 --> 18:50.044
And S will make a passport
if it's not there.

18:50.280 --> 18:51.361

18:51.640 --> 18:52.641

18:55.480 --> 18:59.041
Good. Um, you know how to
get her passcodes, yeah?

You're not the only
hustler in the family.

19:01.880 --> 19:04.167
Promise you, she'll never
pick me out of a line-up.

19:04.360 --> 19:07.045
Make sure she stays naive, Felix.

19:07.560 --> 19:09.085
We don't need anyone else in clone club

19:09.160 --> 19:10.571
and she doesn't need this shit.

19:11.720 --> 19:12.721
Here we go.

happens when you hang out with a guy...

- How you doing?

19:28.120 --> 19:29.565
- Good. You?
- Good.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.524
I got an appointment with Krystal.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.405
Heard she does a mean mani-pedi.

for his extremities, that's hot.

19:58.800 --> 19:59.961

20:00.960 --> 20:03.611
You're CASTOR.

20:08.160 --> 20:10.561
You have a very extensive
sci-fi collection, Scott.

20:12.520 --> 20:13.521
Thank you.

20:14.160 --> 20:16.686
You think I could,
uh, borrow a good book?

20:18.000 --> 20:20.287
Please, Denise has feline asthma.

20:20.600 --> 20:21.647
Oh.

20:21.880 --> 20:24.247
Well, I was gonna
call on your friend Cosima,

20:24.560 --> 20:25.925
but I hear she's not doing well, either.

20:27.600 --> 20:29.841
You think I'd like Asimov?

20:30.160 --> 20:31.446
Probably, classic.

20:31.760 --> 20:33.888
A little too heady,
is that what you're telling me?

20:33.960 --> 20:36.804
No. Go ahead, take it.
Take the <i>Foundation Trilogy.</i>

20:36.880 --> 20:37.881
Well...

20:38.360 --> 20:39.885
There is, um.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.205
One title in particular
that I'm interested in.

20:44.120 --> 20:47.920
A very special edition of HG Wells'

20:48.720 --> 20:50.370
<i>The Island of Dr Moreau.</i>

20:56.640 --> 20:58.881
I couldn't even... I still can't...

20:58.960 --> 21:01.440
You know, identical twin abductors.

21:02.400 --> 21:03.811
How freaky is that?

21:03.880 --> 21:05.689
- (EXHALES)
- Poor Hector.

21:07.560 --> 21:11.929
And I saw the guy with the scar stab
the hotel security guard in the throat.

21:13.320 --> 21:15.288
- Krystal...
- I'm sorry. I, like...

21:16.120 --> 21:18.088
I've nobody left to talk to,

21:18.160 --> 21:20.766
- so I just kind of talk to everybody.
- Yeah.

21:21.840 --> 21:23.763
- Is that okay?
- Yeah, I'm a good listener.

21:24.880 --> 21:26.120
Yeah, I can tell.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.491
It's just been very, like,

21:30.440 --> 21:32.408
- damaging for my psyche.
- Mmm-hmm.

21:32.480 --> 21:35.768
My biggest fears are literally
twins and clowns.

21:36.240 --> 21:38.561
- Clones?
- Clones? Clowns.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.009
- Clown... (LAUGHS) Clowns.
- Yeah.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.525
No. Clones are worse. Twins.

21:42.840 --> 21:44.001
Twins, way worse.

takes her last name" times?

33:54.000 --> 33:55.604
I got the ring, Kellerman.

33:55.760 --> 33:56.966
I don't care what you got.

33:57.040 --> 33:58.326
You work for me now, you understand?

33:58.440 --> 34:00.488
If I want your wife,
I’ll just take her.

34:02.480 --> 34:04.403
Did you just girl-slap me?

34:04.800 --> 34:05.801
You wanna slap?

34:06.240 --> 34:08.288
You want a slap fight, huh?

34:08.719 --> 34:10.529
How's that, slap? How's that, slapper?

34:10.600 --> 34:12.887
You like that, you boat shoe,
chino-wearing bitch?

34:13.360 --> 34:14.804
(BOTH GROAN)

34:16.600 --> 34:19.444
I may be a bitch, but I'm Alison's bitch

34:19.600 --> 34:21.204
and you're just a stupid dropout.

34:27.840 --> 34:28.920
Shit.

34:38.880 --> 34:39.927
DELPHINE: <i>You don't quit us.</i>

34:40.280 --> 34:42.089
In here you have access,
you have control.

34:42.960 --> 34:45.565
Out there, what?
You're just another subject.

34:46.120 --> 34:48.360
- Or worse...
- (SCOFFS) What could be worse than this?

34:48.440 --> 34:51.808
You're self-aware.
Any person, any face, any love.

34:52.320 --> 34:54.129
Anyone could be a spy.

34:54.199 --> 34:55.281
Is that a threat?

34:55.679 --> 34:56.806
Look...

34:58.520 --> 34:59.601
I'm talking about Shay.

34:59.920 --> 35:02.764
Oh, my God. This doesn't have
anything to do with Shay.

35:02.920 --> 35:05.605
Maybe. But how're you going
to know without me?

35:05.680 --> 35:08.126
Delphine, if you're not going
to be with me,

35:08.200 --> 35:11.010
if you're not going to switch sides,
let me go.

35:13.480 --> 35:14.561
SCOTT: Careful, she's delicate.

35:14.640 --> 35:17.564
Yeah, delicate like a spider's web,
aren't you, Rachel?

35:17.640 --> 35:18.721
MRS S: Well done, Scott.

35:18.920 --> 35:20.888
Will you look who's back.

35:22.640 --> 35:23.926
Hello, Sarah.

35:28.440 --> 35:30.647
- SARAH: Krystal Goderich.
- Nice girl.

35:30.840 --> 35:33.002
- Worth 10 of you.
- SARAH: Yeah.

35:33.560 --> 35:36.404
So you better make this
worth it, Rachel.

35:41.800 --> 35:44.804
You need to translate that,
cover-to-cover.

35:44.880 --> 35:46.962
Or else we send you back to Delphine.

35:50.880 --> 35:51.881
Thank you.

36:01.800 --> 36:03.928
The day you left for
Frankfurt, I almost died.

36:06.520 --> 36:08.363
Some kind of near-death experience.

36:09.960 --> 36:12.361
And it was so easy.
I could've just slipped away.

36:13.280 --> 36:14.930
Then I had a vision of you.

36:17.680 --> 36:19.045
I came back for you.

36:21.160 --> 36:22.491
Why didn't you tell me?

36:22.920 --> 36:24.684
'Cause you don't believe
stuff like that.

36:27.640 --> 36:29.210
So we had to move on.

36:29.640 --> 36:31.483
Come here. Come here.

36:43.760 --> 36:45.285
I'm sorry.

36:46.520 --> 36:48.045
You should've trusted me.

- Yeah.

- Maybe.

- Sarah, the code.
- Shit.

37:16.200 --> 37:17.406
Not wise, Mrs Sadler.

37:24.280 --> 37:25.850
It's quite the sight you two make.

37:31.480 --> 37:32.925
Thank you, Rachel.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.684
You filthy...

37:34.760 --> 37:36.364
Sorry to raise any false hopes.

37:37.240 --> 37:38.730
But Delphine knew you had a copy.

37:39.360 --> 37:41.681
(STAMMERS) My book!

37:43.080 --> 37:44.241
My father...

37:44.360 --> 37:45.930
Rachel? Rachel!

37:46.160 --> 37:47.400
She's having some sort of seizure.

37:47.480 --> 37:48.606
Call a medical team.

37:53.280 --> 37:55.965
Nealon, you assured me she
could handle them moving her.

37:56.080 --> 37:57.206
Sorry, I thought she could.

37:57.520 --> 37:58.601
Here's the copy.

37:58.680 --> 38:00.444
It's no use without her.
She's the only one who can read it.

38:00.520 --> 38:02.124
Please. I have to get her to surgery.

38:18.360 --> 38:20.124
Should've made two copies.

38:20.640 --> 38:21.846
Yeah. Amateur hour.

38:23.560 --> 38:25.483
Delphine was onto us the whole time.

38:25.560 --> 38:27.164
The stress was too much for her.

38:28.040 --> 38:30.088
She suffered
an acute intracranial bleed.

38:30.240 --> 38:32.527
I've induced a coma
to control the swelling, but...

38:33.880 --> 38:35.803
She may never recover.

38:36.600 --> 38:39.046
- My apologies.
- Get back to your patient.

38:54.480 --> 38:56.801
We couldn't give you the book because

38:56.920 --> 38:59.002
- if Topside had gotten hold of that...
- Topside.

39:00.920 --> 39:05.164
Scott lost the book because someone
close to you tipped CASTOR off.

39:05.320 --> 39:06.845
It would've been safer with me.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.124
- Where's the copy?
- Secure.

39:09.440 --> 39:10.646
And absolutely useless.

39:11.640 --> 39:13.961
You just cost us the one
person who could translate it.

Your resignation is accepted,
and so is yours.

39:18.360 --> 39:19.407

- London.
- What do you mean?

39:43.640 --> 39:48.168
Well, the bit Rachel translated,
it points to London. It's our best lead.

39:48.600 --> 39:50.125
(LAUGHS) It's our only lead.

39:50.200 --> 39:51.406
To the CASTOR original.

39:51.480 --> 39:54.450
Well, if they find him,
then they'll never stop.

39:54.520 --> 39:55.681
