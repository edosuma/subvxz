08:49.800 --> 08:52.563
CHLOE HAD SO MUCH FUN
AT THE DEALERSHIP

08:52.563 --> 08:54.735
TALKING TO THE ANDERSONS
FROM CHURCH.

08:54.735 --> 08:57.267
SO FUNNY THEY WERE BUYING
THE SAME CAR AS US.

DO THIS ALL THE TIME.

09:10.320 --> 09:12.222

09:17.728 --> 09:20.861
IT SMELLED LIKE FRENCH FRIES
AND CHOCOLATE.

09:20.861 --> 09:23.994
HONEY, NO SNACKS
IN THE NEW CAR, OKAY?

09:23.994 --> 09:26.867

CHLOE, JUST GIVE ME
THE DONUT HOLE.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.999
BUT DADDY--
CHLOE! COME ON.

09:28.999 --> 09:30.270

09:32.673 --> 09:36.006
THAT WAS MY FAVORITE DIRT BALL
FROM THE DOG PARK.

09:38.078 --> 09:41.311
OHH!
NOT IN MY NEW CAR,
YOU DON'T!

09:41.311 --> 09:43.914
UNH-UNH!
( shouting )

09:43.914 --> 09:46.016
YEAH, I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE AWESOME

09:46.016 --> 09:48.018
TO HAVE A REAL DOG
AS THE MASCOT.

09:48.018 --> 09:49.860

THE LOCKER ROOM.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.990

10:19.990 --> 10:22.693
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?!
EL, YOUR HAIR LOOKS
FANTASTIC,

10:22.693 --> 10:25.125
SO FULL OF MOISTURE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING DO?!!

10:25.125 --> 10:27.958
I DON'T KNOW.
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT!

10:27.958 --> 10:29.199
YOU SEEM UPSET.

10:29.199 --> 10:31.061
WE'RE GONNA GO.

10:33.303 --> 10:36.907
I WAS SO STUPID TO RISK
STAN'S SAFETY TO BEGIN WITH.

10:36.907 --> 10:40.270
AND NOW I'M GONNA TAKE
ANY RISK NECESSARY
TO GET HIM BACK.

10:40.270 --> 10:42.773
WHATEVER RULE I HAVE TO BREAK--
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

10:53.884 --> 10:56.656
Stan: WHY DID YOU
SNEAK ME OUT OF THE LOCKER ROOM?

10:56.656 --> 10:59.289
I WAS WORKING OUT
MY HALFTIME ROUTINE
WITH THE BAND!

10:59.289 --> 11:02.232
CHECK IT--
♪ BOOM, SHH, BOOM, SHH ♪

11:02.232 --> 11:04.094
( imitating beat box )

11:04.094 --> 11:05.936
♪ BOOM SHH, BOOM, SHH ♪

11:05.936 --> 11:08.198
♪ SHH SHH SHH SHH ♪

11:08.198 --> 11:09.940
♪ BOOM! ♪
STAN!

11:09.940 --> 11:12.072
I'M PRETENDING
YOU'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED
BY EAST GLENDALE.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.443
IT'S THE PERFECT PRANK.

11:13.443 --> 11:15.746
THEY'RE GONNA GET
IN A TON OF TROUBLE!

11:15.746 --> 11:18.008
BUT NOW I CAN'T BE
A PART OF THE PEP RALLY.

11:18.008 --> 11:21.151
RIGHT! WHICH WILL MAKE
YOUR TRIUMPHANT RETURN
AT THE BIG GAME

11:21.151 --> 11:23.083
THAT MUCH MORE DRAMATIC.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.415
THINK ABOUT IT:
THE HEROIC MASCOT,

11:25.415 --> 11:27.958
HAVING ESCAPED FROM
THE EVIL CLUTCHES
OF HIS TORMENTORS,

11:27.958 --> 11:30.961
REFUSES TO LET
THE CROWD DOWN.

11:30.961 --> 11:32.462
I LOVE IT!

11:32.462 --> 11:35.395
HEY, MAYBE I'LL COME IN
WITH A LIMP, RIGHT?

11:35.395 --> 11:37.898
AND A FAR-AWAY LOOK.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.700
AND WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME
WHAT HAPPENED I'LL SAY,

11:40.700 --> 11:44.134
(hoarse)
"IT'S JUST TOO PAINFUL
TO TALK ABOUT."

11:44.134 --> 11:46.476
BUT YOU CAN'T SAY
ANYTHING, REMEMBER?

11:46.476 --> 11:48.338
OH, RIGHT! RIGHT.

11:48.338 --> 11:52.182
THEN JUST THE LIMP
AND THE...FARAWAY LOOK

11:52.182 --> 11:55.185
Avery:
JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE...
GOOD BOY...

11:55.185 --> 11:57.818
LITTLE BIT...
LITTLE BIT...

11:57.818 --> 12:00.390
GOOD!
WHOA!

12:00.390 --> 12:03.854
IS THAT--?
YEP, THE EAST GLENDALE PIG.

12:03.854 --> 12:06.296
THOSE GUYS KIDNAPPED STAN,
SO I STOLE THE PIG

12:06.296 --> 12:08.158
SO WE CAN TRADE IT
TO GET STAN BACK.

12:08.158 --> 12:10.931
THAT'S RIGHT. YOU DON'T MESS
WITH AVERY JENNINGS.

12:10.931 --> 12:14.034
YOU STEAL MY DOG,
I STEAL YOUR PIG.

12:15.505 --> 12:18.238
I AM RISKING EVERYTHING.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.140
I'M GOING FOUR BALLS!

12:23.974 --> 12:26.817
Stan:
SHE STOLE THE PIG
AND WENT FOUR BALLS!

12:26.817 --> 12:28.218
THIS IS BAD!

12:28.218 --> 12:31.151
BUT IT'S STILL NOT
THE BAD, BAD THING.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.983
STAN?!

12:34.154 --> 12:36.056
YOU'RE OKAY!

12:36.056 --> 12:38.028
THANK GOODNESS! I'VE BEEN
SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

12:38.028 --> 12:39.529
WHAT HAPPENED?

12:39.529 --> 12:42.492
IT'S JUST TOO PAINFUL
TO TALK ABOUT.

12:42.492 --> 12:45.796
STAN WAS NEVER GONE.
IT WAS A PRANK...

12:45.796 --> 12:47.767
TO MESS WITH THEIR MINDS.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.340
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

12:50.340 --> 12:54.174
I TOOK THIS HUGE RISK,
AND NOW I'M GONNA BE EXPELLED.

12:54.174 --> 12:55.545
I WON'T GET INTO LAW SCHOOL,

12:55.545 --> 12:59.109
AND I DEFINITELY WON'T BECOME
THE FIRST JUGGLING PRESIDENT.

12:59.109 --> 13:01.181
SINCE BUCHANAN.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.253
YOU GUYS WANT TO
GO FOR A RIDE IN
THE NEW CAR?

13:03.253 --> 13:06.056
IT'S GOT A SUN ROOF
AND SEAT HEATERS
AND CUP HOLDERS,

13:06.056 --> 13:08.919
AND EACH ONE OF THE--
WHAT IS A PIG DOING
IN OUR FAMILY ROOM?!

13:08.919 --> 13:11.261
HEY, LOOK AT THAT!
A PIG!

13:12.893 --> 13:16.026
I LOVE MY NEW PIG!

13:16.026 --> 13:18.298
THIS IS NOT KOSHER.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.831
ALL RIGHT, WHAT HAPPENED?

13:20.831 --> 13:23.403
WELL, I WAS TRYING TO...
Stan: YOU GUYS ALREADY
KNOW ALL THIS.

13:23.403 --> 13:27.477
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE AVERY
EXPLAIN IT ALL TO MOM AND DAD,
RIGHT?

13:27.477 --> 13:29.039
YOU CAN JUGGLE?

13:31.241 --> 13:34.214
I'M NAMING HIM
"BIG MURRAY."

13:34.214 --> 13:36.116
NO, NO. YOU'RE MISSING
THE BIG PICTURE.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.048
I COULD BE EXPELLED!
Tyler: ME TOO!

13:38.048 --> 13:42.192
I JUST SAY WE TELL EVERYONE
STAN ESCAPED AND FOUND
HIS WAY HOME.

13:42.192 --> 13:45.355
WE LET THE PIG GO,
AND NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW
AVERY TOOK HIM.

13:45.355 --> 13:47.357
WE CAN'T JUST LET A PIG GO.

13:47.357 --> 13:51.561
AN UNSUPERVISED PIG
WOULD NOT LAST TWO MINUTES
IN PASADENA.

13:51.561 --> 13:55.235
I'VE GOT IT. WE HAVE TO
SNEAK HIM BACK BEFORE
THEY KNOW HE'S GONE.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.307
YOU CAN'T TAKE
BIG MURRAY!

13:57.307 --> 14:00.911
HE'S SO MUCH BETTER THAN
MONKEY-FACE CHIMP-BOY.

14:00.911 --> 14:02.572
HEY!

14:02.572 --> 14:04.614
WE HAVE TO.
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

14:04.614 --> 14:08.078
THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS TO CALL
THE OTHER SCHOOL IMMEDIATELY,

14:08.078 --> 14:10.080
TELL THEM EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED,

14:10.080 --> 14:12.152
AND THAT WE HAVE THEIR PIG.

14:12.152 --> 14:15.355
ARE YOU OUT OF
YOUR MIND, WOMAN?!

14:15.355 --> 14:18.188
THIS IS NOT THE TIME
TO DO THE RIGHT THING!

14:18.188 --> 14:21.131
I HAVE BEEN TAKING RISKS
FOR THE LAST TWO DAYS,

14:21.131 --> 14:24.094
AND I AM NOT
GETTING OFF THIS TRAIN NOW!

14:24.094 --> 14:27.097
OKAY, WE'RE SNEAKING
THE PIG BACK.

14:27.097 --> 14:30.140
AM I IN TROUBLE
FOR CALLING YOU "WOMAN"
INSTEAD OF "MOM"?

14:34.474 --> 14:37.647
OKAY, WE CAN'T JUST
LEAD HIM DOWN THE STREET
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT. NO.

14:37.647 --> 14:39.409
OPERATION
"BRING HOME THE BACON"

14:39.409 --> 14:41.211
IS GONNA TAKE
SOME REAL PLANNING.

14:41.211 --> 14:45.185
AS SOON AS IT GETS DARK,
WE GO COMMANDO.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.289
DAD, I DON'T THINK THAT MEANS
WHAT YOU THINK IT MEANS.

14:49.289 --> 14:51.621
BOY, I HOPE NOT.

14:51.621 --> 14:55.125
OKAY, AT 2100,
WE PLACE THE TARGET
IN THE CAR

14:55.125 --> 14:56.896
AND SWIM TO EAST GLENDALE.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.129
NOW, IF I SUSPECT
A BLOWN FLOATER
ON THIS O.P.O.,

14:59.129 --> 15:00.971
I WILL PLANT
A CANARY TRAP,

15:00.971 --> 15:04.134
DRY-CLEAN IT,
GO TOTALLY JOE!

15:04.134 --> 15:07.007
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
ANY OF THAT MEANS--

15:07.007 --> 15:09.279
WHICH I'VE NEVER SAID BEFORE--

15:09.279 --> 15:11.441
BUT I LIKE THE FIRE
IN YOUR EYE!

15:11.441 --> 15:13.913
I AM WITH THIS MAN.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.046
AM I IN TROUBLE FOR
CALLING YOU "THIS MAN"?

15:16.046 --> 15:18.018
NO, NO, NOT AT ALL, SWEETIE!

15:18.018 --> 15:20.020
I'M PUMPED!
I'M READY FOR ACTION!

15:20.020 --> 15:22.252
I'M GONNA NEED
MY BLACK TURTLENECK,
MY SKI MASK,

15:22.252 --> 15:25.055
AND MY SPECIAL OPS
UTILITY PACK.

15:25.055 --> 15:26.626
MY MAN PURSE.

15:28.458 --> 15:31.701
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU SAID PLACE THE PIG
IN THE CAR.

15:31.701 --> 15:35.165
THERE'S NO WAY WE'RE GONNA FIT
ALL OF US AND THAT PIG
IN YOUR CAR

15:37.007 --> 15:39.109
NOOOO.

15:39.109 --> 15:41.241
NO, NO, NO...

15:41.241 --> 15:44.274
NO, NO, NO!
( pig squealing )

15:44.274 --> 15:46.576
YOU SAID WE SHOULD HAVE
A FAMILY OUTING

15:46.576 --> 15:48.348
AND REALLY ENJOY EACH OTHER.

15:48.348 --> 15:50.580
I'M ENJOYING YOU RIGHT NOW.

15:50.580 --> 15:52.282
ARE YOU ENJOYING ME?

15:54.284 --> 15:56.286
I'M GOING DARK.

15:56.286 --> 15:59.729
( pig grunting )
WHAT IS THAT PIG
DOING BACK THERE?!

15:59.729 --> 16:02.062
( clatter, squealing )

16:02.062 --> 16:05.365
I THINK SHE'S NESTING.
MY CAR!

16:05.365 --> 16:08.198
MY BEAUTIFUL NEW CAR!
FORGET THE CAR.

16:08.198 --> 16:12.242
LOOK, I'M NOT LETTING
MY FUTURE GET DERAILED
BY SWINEGATE.

16:12.242 --> 16:14.444
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S WHAT
THEY'LL CALL IT.

16:14.444 --> 16:18.408
I'M SORRY I SNAPPED.
I'M TENSE AND I'VE HAD
NO FRESH FRUIT TODAY.

16:18.408 --> 16:21.311
( louder squealing )
WHAT IS GOING ON BACK THERE?!

16:21.311 --> 16:24.584
IT'S A SHORT RIDE, HONEY.
HOW MUCH DAMAGE CAN HE DO?

16:24.584 --> 16:27.257
WHAT ON EARTH
IS HE DOING?!

16:27.257 --> 16:30.220
I THINK "HE"
JUST HAD BABIES!

16:31.661 --> 16:35.195
BIG MURRAY'S A MOMMY!

16:35.195 --> 16:37.527
OH! OH...

16:41.301 --> 16:45.135
TYLER.
WRAP THE LITTLE PIGS
IN THE BLANKET.

16:45.135 --> 16:47.207
THAT'S FUNNY--
"PIGS IN A BLANKET."

16:47.207 --> 16:49.779
I'M SO SPRITZED OUT
BY THIS MISSION.

16:49.779 --> 16:52.382
I CAN BELIEVE
I'D MISS SOMETHING

16:52.382 --> 16:55.785
I'VE WANTED TO SEE
MY ENTIRE LIFE--
A PIG BIRTH.

16:55.785 --> 16:59.049
YOU CAN STILL SMELL IT
IF YOU WANT.

16:59.049 --> 17:00.520
I WANT TO NAME THEM.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.223
HOW CAN WE TELL THE BOYS
FROM THE GIRLS?

17:03.223 --> 17:04.794
APPARENTLY WE CAN'T.

17:08.128 --> 17:11.301
UNBELIEVABLE. PIG BIRTH
ALL OVER MY NEW CAR?

17:11.301 --> 17:13.563
SO MUCH FOR GETTING RID
OF THE NICKNAME "SMELLEN."

17:13.563 --> 17:16.436
I'LL BE "SMELLEN" FOREVER.
"HI, SMELLEN." "HI, MARY."

17:16.436 --> 17:18.438
"HELLO, SMELLEN."
"HELLO, REBECCA."

17:18.438 --> 17:20.470
"HELLO--"
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!

17:20.470 --> 17:23.213
YOU STAY WITH ME, SOLDIER!

17:23.213 --> 17:24.774
I'M COMING TOO.

17:24.774 --> 17:28.148
I WAN TO SAY GOOD-BYE
TO BIG MURRAY, LITTLE PHYLLIS,

17:28.148 --> 17:30.080
TINY HAROLD AND DAVEED.

17:33.723 --> 17:35.655
ALL RIGHT, STAN,
YOU GUARD THE CAR.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.587
MY PRESIDENCY
HANGS IN THE BALANCE.

17:37.587 --> 17:41.131
IT'S NEVER THE CRIME;
IT'S ALWAYS THE COVER-UP.

17:42.762 --> 17:45.235
THAT'S RIGHT,
I'M GUARDING THE CAR,

17:45.235 --> 17:49.068
THE MOST IMPORTANT PART
OF THE MISSION.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.841
MAN, I'M BORED.

17:54.744 --> 17:58.108
( static ) HEY, THERE IS
A VAN PARKED OUT HERE.

17:58.108 --> 18:01.381
I'M GONNA GO CHECK OUT BACK,
MAKE SURE NO ONE'S MESSING
WITH THE MASCOTS.

18:01.381 --> 18:03.153
UH-OH. GOTTA
DISTRACT HIM.

18:03.153 --> 18:05.084
YO, DUDE!
WHERE YA GOIN'?

18:07.157 --> 18:08.658
WHO SAID THAT?

18:10.820 --> 18:12.662
IS SOMEONE
WITH THIS DOG?

18:12.662 --> 18:15.265
HERE! UNDER THE CAR!
I'M STUCK!

18:16.766 --> 18:19.669
I MEAN UP HERE.
I'M ON TOP OF THE CAR.

18:23.233 --> 18:27.106
O-KAY. WHAT'S GOIN' ON HERE?
WHO'S SAYING THAT?

18:28.678 --> 18:30.780
I'M BEHIND YOU.

18:30.780 --> 18:32.582
I'M OVER YOU!

18:32.582 --> 18:33.613
I'M UNDER YOU.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.645
I'M YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE.

18:35.645 --> 18:38.818
I'M RUNNING DOWN THE STREET!
YOU'LL NEVER CATCH ME!

18:40.690 --> 18:44.724
HA HA HA HA!

18:44.724 --> 18:47.597
WELL, I GUESS WE SEE WHY
HE'S NOT GUARDING A BANK.

18:49.629 --> 18:53.132
WHOO! HIGH FIVE!
HIGH FIVE!
AVERY.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.664
AVERY! CHILL OUT.

18:54.664 --> 18:57.837
NO WAY. I TOOK A HUGE RISK
AND IT PAID OF.

18:57.837 --> 19:01.271
I FEEL GREAT!
LET'S STEAL SOMETHING ELSE
AND PUT IT BACK.

19:01.271 --> 19:03.813
MOVE! COMMENCE PHASE 3.
WHAT'S PHASE 3?

19:03.813 --> 19:05.775
UM...AH...

19:05.775 --> 19:08.178
I ELIMINATE ALL OF YOU
TO COVER MY TRACKS.

19:08.178 --> 19:10.620
OKAY, MAYBE THE WEBSITE
I GOT THIS FROM

19:10.620 --> 19:12.652
WAS A LITTLE HARDCORE.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.254
LET'S JUST GO HOME.

19:14.254 --> 19:15.555
BUT LET'S BE COOL.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.887
YOU DON'T WANT TO DRAW
ANY ATTENTION TO OURSELVES.

19:17.887 --> 19:20.190
WHEN AM I NOT COOL?

19:20.190 --> 19:22.832
( car alarm wails )
UHH!

19:22.832 --> 19:27.297
( barking, shouting,
alarm continues wailing )

19:29.769 --> 19:32.802
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.
FINE WORK, EVERYBODY.

19:32.802 --> 19:34.844
THAT WAS REALLY COOL!

19:34.844 --> 19:38.848
WHICH IS WEIRD,
BECAUSE I WAS WITH MY FAMILY.

19:38.848 --> 19:41.811
I'M JUST HAPPY
THAT THE PIG IS BACK,
STAN IS SAFE,

19:41.811 --> 19:45.815
AND MY 2044 PRESIDENTIAL BID
IS NO LONGER IN JEOPARDY.

19:45.815 --> 19:48.518
OH, AND I WONDER IF
I CAN JUGGLE PINS?

19:48.518 --> 19:50.189
WHERE DID YOU GET THOSE?

19:50.189 --> 19:53.763
I WALKED A 700-POUND PIG
FROM GLENDALE TO PASADENA,

19:53.763 --> 19:57.897
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHERE I GOT BOWLING PINS?

19:57.897 --> 20:01.731
I HAVE TO ADMIT
THIS WHOLE OPERATION
WAS KIND OF EXCITING...

20:01.731 --> 20:03.733
COMMANDER.

20:04.834 --> 20:06.936
IS THIS WHERE
THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL

20:06.936 --> 20:10.580
FALLS FOR THE DASHING,
DANGEROUS SPY?

20:13.513 --> 20:15.445
WHY ARE YOU WEARING
MY TURTLENECK?

20:15.445 --> 20:18.348
WELL, WE WERE IN A HURRY
AND I COULDN'T FIND MINE,
SO I JUST GRABBED THE FIRST--

20:18.348 --> 20:21.891
WAS THE MISSION
SUCCESSFUL OR NOT?!

20:21.891 --> 20:24.854
YES, YOU'RE STILL
MY DASHING, HANDSOME SPY.

20:24.854 --> 20:26.426
HMM...

20:26.426 --> 20:28.298
THIS IS GREAT, HUH?

20:28.298 --> 20:32.462
ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER,
PULLING THIS OFF AS A UNIT,
THE FOUR OF US?

20:32.462 --> 20:34.834
AREN'T THERE FIVE OF US?

20:34.834 --> 20:36.406
Together:
CHLOE!

20:38.908 --> 20:40.570
SERIOUSLY?

20:40.570 --> 20:43.273
YOU GUYS DON'T
TALK AT ALL?

20:43.273 --> 20:45.275
NOT EVEN YOU, DAVEED?

20:46.816 --> 20:47.817
NOTHIN'?

20:47.817 --> 20:49.679
♪ ( ominous organ chord ) ♪

20:49.679 --> 20:51.781
Stan: LEAVING CHLOE
IN A PIG PEN?

20:51.781 --> 20:54.624
STILL NOT THE BAD, BAD THING.

20:54.624 --> 20:56.786
ACTUALLY,
IT'S KIND OF A CUTE THING.

20:58.628 --> 21:01.591
OKAY, GANG, OPERATION
"CHLOE GRAB" IS A GO!

21:01.591 --> 21:02.892
BENNETT? HONEY?

21:02.892 --> 21:04.434
COVER UP.
IF THIS GOES SOUTH,

21:04.434 --> 21:06.896
THAT SWEATER'S NOT
GONNA BE YOUR FRIEND IN JAIL.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.671
Stan:
THE THING ABOUT RISK,

21:11.671 --> 21:14.544
THE MORE YOU PUT ON THE LINE,
THE BIGGER THE PAYOFF.

21:14.544 --> 21:16.976
AVERY RISKED A LOT,
AND IT ALL WORKED OUT.

21:16.976 --> 21:20.480
SHE EVEN GOT IN WITH
THOSE GIRLS ON THE PEP SQUAD.

21:22.011 --> 21:24.914
AND I TOOK SOME RISKS
TO BE MASCOT.

21:24.914 --> 21:26.986
AND IT WAS...

21:26.986 --> 21:29.889
(laughing)...AWESOME!

21:29.889 --> 21:31.791
IT WAS EVERYTHING
I HOPED IT WOULD BE,

21:31.791 --> 21:33.663
MY MOMENT OF GLORY!

21:33.663 --> 21:35.365
AND THAT'S...

21:35.365 --> 21:37.867
WHEN THE BAD, BAD THING
HAPPENED.

21:37.867 --> 21:40.730
A SKATEBOARDING PIG!

21:40.730 --> 21:42.972
NO ONE PAID ATTENTION
TO ME AFTER THAT.

21:42.972 --> 21:46.476
BUT AT LEAST I'M STILL A STAR
IN MY OWN FAMILY--

21:46.476 --> 21:47.937
MOST OF THE TIME.
