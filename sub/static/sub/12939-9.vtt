But the kids are hiding.

00:35.903 --> 00:37.269
So?

Y'see, dice...

01:09.370 --> 01:10.436
At your age,

01:10.438 --> 01:11.737
it's normal for boys

01:11.739 --> 01:12.805
to start noticing new

01:12.807 --> 01:14.039

01:14.041 --> 01:17.209

>> 'Cuz his mom hates fighting,

01:47.942 --> 01:49.308
that goomer's mom is coming?
>> 'Cuz his mom hates fighting,
and goomer's never told her

01:49.310 --> 01:50.342
'cuz his mom hates fighting,

Goomer's not gonna stand up

01:56.917 --> 01:58.050
Goomer's not gonna stand up
to his mother.
And if she finds out

01:58.052 --> 01:59.051
to his mother.
And if she finds out
he's a fighter,

01:59.053 --> 01:59.918
and if she finds out
he's a fighter,
she'll probably make him move

01:59.920 --> 02:02.054
he's a fighter,
she'll probably make him move
back home to Louisiana.

02:02.056 --> 02:03.255
She'll probably make him move
back home to Louisiana.
>> Louisiana?

02:03.257 --> 02:04.056
