00:17.142 --> 00:18.810
So, we're driving to the show?

00:19.602 --> 00:20.603
Yup.

00:20.687 --> 00:21.604
With the wife?

00:21.688 --> 00:22.605
And the kids.

00:22.689 --> 00:23.690
[groans]

00:25.191 --> 00:26.025
Hi, Jack.

00:28.778 --> 00:29.612
Hi, James.

00:30.947 --> 00:33.033
Remind me again why we're doing this?

00:33.408 --> 00:37.912
This Ireland trip is about the family
being together and discovering our roots.

00:37.996 --> 00:39.247
Thanks, sweetie.

00:39.330 --> 00:41.833
Well, I just discovered I don't wanna go.

00:41.916 --> 00:43.126
[cooing]

00:43.209 --> 00:44.794
Walter, you're part of this family
whether you like it or not.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.380
Hey, look what I found
smooshed under the seat.

00:47.464 --> 00:50.717
This old, unopened letter to you, Walter,

00:50.800 --> 00:52.343
-dated 196--
-Give me that.

00:52.927 --> 00:56.681
Oh. Hey, Audrey,
what's this extra baby seat for?

00:56.765 --> 00:58.600
For when Bubba J passes out?

00:58.683 --> 00:59.809
[Walter] What the hell?

01:00.060 --> 01:01.603
[chuckles] You'll see.

01:02.187 --> 01:03.063
[Peanut] "You'll see"?

01:03.980 --> 01:05.732
-What does that mean?
-[Walter] What is this?

01:05.815 --> 01:07.150
[Peanut] Another baby?

01:08.526 --> 01:11.446
Speaking of Bubba J,
has anybody seen him lately?

01:11.529 --> 01:13.990
-[Walter groans]
-Oh, he wanted to ride on the roof.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.617
[chuckles]

01:15.700 --> 01:17.077
[rock music playing]

01:20.705 --> 01:21.956
[chuckling]

01:25.585 --> 01:26.795
[Bubba J mimicking car engine]

01:29.422 --> 01:32.175
[Bubba J] I'm making a left turn! Whoo!

01:47.273 --> 01:49.067
Well, we're here.

01:49.859 --> 01:53.988
Well, we must be in Ireland.
These bugs taste like beer.

01:54.072 --> 01:54.906
[chuckles]

01:57.408 --> 01:59.119
[audience cheering]

01:59.577 --> 02:02.956
[Achmed]  Greetings, Irish infidels.

02:03.414 --> 02:08.169
Please welcome to the stage,
the biggest infidel ever,

02:08.252 --> 02:12.090
Mr. Jeff Dunham!

02:25.728 --> 02:28.481
What a warm welcome.
Thank you for being here this evening.

02:28.565 --> 02:29.732
I wanna start by saying--

02:29.816 --> 02:32.902
People are saying, "Why in the world
did you go to Dublin, Ireland,

02:32.986 --> 02:35.363
to do your Netflix special?"
I'll tell you why.

02:35.446 --> 02:39.242
I got a ventriloquist dummy in the third
grade, started practicing, doing shows,

02:39.325 --> 02:43.037
through elementary, junior high,
high school, paid my way through college.

02:43.121 --> 02:46.249
Did almost 20 years of comedy clubs
throughout the U.S. and Canada,

02:46.332 --> 02:49.586
then turned into small theaters,
then big theaters, then giant arenas,

02:49.669 --> 02:53.423
and all around the world, and here we are.
This is all because of folks like you.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.633
Thanks for making that happen.
There you go.

02:55.717 --> 02:56.926
[audience cheering]

03:03.725 --> 03:05.643
Are you ready for the reason you're here?

03:05.727 --> 03:07.979
Are you ready for the little people
in the boxes?

03:08.062 --> 03:09.314
[audience cheering]

03:15.486 --> 03:16.654
All right.

03:19.365 --> 03:20.199
Thank you.

03:22.285 --> 03:25.038
The first guy I'd like to introduce
I think audiences enjoy,

03:25.121 --> 03:29.500
because everyone knows someone like this,
in your own family or where you work.

03:29.584 --> 03:31.669
Please help me welcome
my old friend, Walter.

03:32.086 --> 03:33.504
[audience cheering]

03:39.219 --> 03:41.346
Oh, shut the hell up.

03:42.305 --> 03:43.765
[groaning]

03:45.016 --> 03:47.977
-How you doing tonight, Walter?
-Who the hell cares?

03:49.103 --> 03:50.772
Lighten up a bit, we're in Dublin.

03:50.855 --> 03:52.565
Oh, yay, Dublin, yay.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.192
[audience laughing]

03:54.275 --> 03:57.779
You know, I've heard the Irish pay
more attention to our American politics

03:57.862 --> 03:59.113
than most Americans do.

03:59.197 --> 04:00.406
Yeah, seems like it.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.785
Yeah. But you watch just for the comedy.

04:03.868 --> 04:05.161
[audience laughing]

04:06.788 --> 04:08.248
[audience cheering]

04:10.833 --> 04:13.878
So, in the U.S. presidential election,
you guys know everything.

04:13.962 --> 04:16.255
Do you know who the real loser was?

04:16.339 --> 04:17.507
-Who?
-Bill.

04:17.589 --> 04:19.007
[chuckles]

04:19.091 --> 04:19.926
Why is that?

04:20.009 --> 04:23.012
Because now,
Hillary is home every single night.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.055
[audience laughing]

04:25.431 --> 04:26.724
[chuckling]

04:30.186 --> 04:34.399
And with Trump in office in the U.S.,
Jeff, now, be prepared.

04:34.482 --> 04:36.901
-For what?
-Soon JosÃ© JalapeÃ±o,

04:36.985 --> 04:39.362
your Mexican guy, will be out of the show.

04:39.445 --> 04:40.822
[audience laughing]

04:43.658 --> 04:45.451
[audience cheering]

04:48.371 --> 04:51.749
Poor JosÃ©. You're gonna have to settle
for an American pickle on a pole.

04:52.208 --> 04:53.876
[audience laughing]

04:53.960 --> 04:55.837
Wrapped in bacon and deep-fried.

04:56.796 --> 04:59.966
Hey, did you notice in the trunk there,
I'm building a little wall?

05:00.049 --> 05:01.175
Did you see that?

05:01.259 --> 05:02.343
[audience laughing]

05:03.261 --> 05:05.513
Yeah, keeping that little bastard
on his side.

05:07.390 --> 05:10.059
And I'm gonna get Jeff
to pay for the wall.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.269
[audience laughing]

05:12.895 --> 05:14.230
[audience cheering]

05:19.360 --> 05:21.487
You know, Walter,
JosÃ© is legal in the U.S.

05:22.238 --> 05:23.197
Oh.

05:23.781 --> 05:25.867
Then I guess I'll build a little gate.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.830
Yeah, little fucker would probably
dig right under it.

05:31.831 --> 05:32.832
Using his stick.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.419
Wait. He can pogo right over the thing.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.796
Doing, Doing, Doing,  ole!

05:40.381 --> 05:43.217
And you know what else?
The racial stuff is worse than ever.

05:43.301 --> 05:45.303
I don't know if it is here,
but it is there.

05:45.386 --> 05:46.304
-That's right.
-Yeah.

05:46.387 --> 05:50.016
Can you even use your African-American
character, Sweet Daddy Dee, anymore?

05:50.600 --> 05:54.854
Wait, I'm sorry. We're in Ireland, yeah.
It's obviously not African-American here.

05:54.937 --> 05:56.856
They don't say African-Irish, do they?

05:56.939 --> 05:58.941
[audience laughing]

05:59.150 --> 06:00.276
They just say black.

06:00.359 --> 06:01.903
Oh. Oh, that's a lot easier.

06:01.986 --> 06:06.532
I don't wanna offend anyone anywhere,
but can I just please say black?

06:06.616 --> 06:09.243
-Okay--
-I am not Northern European-American.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.704
I don't care. I'm freaking white.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.499
Or off-white, or pink, I don't know.

06:15.625 --> 06:18.169
All I know is there's black, brown, red,
yellow, white.

06:18.252 --> 06:20.338
I don't care. Just mow my lawn.

06:20.421 --> 06:21.255
What?

06:21.339 --> 06:22.924
[audience laughing, then cheering]

06:23.716 --> 06:24.550
[Jeff] Walter.

06:25.593 --> 06:26.511
[Walter] What?!

06:27.303 --> 06:28.638
I said "white" last.

06:28.721 --> 06:30.890
Get the white guy to mow my lawn,
I don't care.

06:30.973 --> 06:33.059
The white-trash cracker
from the trailer park.

06:33.142 --> 06:34.393
[audience laughing]

06:34.477 --> 06:36.020
And don't call me racist.

06:36.104 --> 06:38.981
-All right, why not?
-Because calling someone racist is racist.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.567
I'm actually an I-don't-give-a-craprican.

06:43.611 --> 06:46.322
Slightly less angry
than the I-don't-give-a-shitricans.

06:47.365 --> 06:50.451
Now, whatever you do, stay away
from the I-don't-give-a-fuckricans.

06:50.535 --> 06:51.494
[audience laughing]

06:52.036 --> 06:53.079
They have meetings.

06:54.705 --> 06:58.000
Back to what I asked earlier,
can't you use Sweet Daddy Dee anymore?

06:58.084 --> 07:00.253
Yeah. I've been using him
in some of our videos.

07:00.336 --> 07:02.380
Okay, but he's not
on the tour bus right now.

07:02.463 --> 07:03.422
-Not now.
-Okay.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.049
Well, when you do bring him back,

07:05.133 --> 07:08.136
just make sure you don't put him
in the back of the bus.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.138
[audience laughing]

07:14.767 --> 07:15.601
Yeah.

07:20.398 --> 07:21.983
Black puppets matter.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.693
[audience laughing]

07:24.694 --> 07:28.114
On a different subject, you say
one of your daughters is getting married?

07:28.197 --> 07:31.159
-Bree, my oldest. Getting married soon.
-Oh, good. That's great.

07:31.242 --> 07:32.618
[audience laughing]

07:32.702 --> 07:34.078
You were adopted, right?

07:34.162 --> 07:36.122
-Actually, I was adopted.
-Good. yeah.

07:37.790 --> 07:38.708
Are you sure?

07:38.791 --> 07:39.625
Yes, I'm sure.

07:39.709 --> 07:43.087
Or is it just something your parents said
to make themselves feel better?

07:43.171 --> 07:44.672
[audience laughing]

07:45.673 --> 07:47.675
-No, I was adopted.
-Okay, okay.

07:47.758 --> 07:51.345
Are your biological parents
gonna walk your daughter down the aisle?

07:52.263 --> 07:53.347
Why would they?

07:53.431 --> 07:55.266
Well, they're good at giving kids away.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.310
[audience laughing]

07:57.393 --> 07:58.644
[laughing]

08:00.688 --> 08:01.856
That's a good joke.

08:05.401 --> 08:07.153
No, Walter, I'm giving her away.

08:07.236 --> 08:08.863
Yeah, see? It's genetic.

08:08.946 --> 08:10.072
[cackles]

08:13.409 --> 08:16.037
The tradition is for the bride's father
to give her away.

08:16.120 --> 08:19.040
Yeah, you're gonna be going,
"Here you go, pal. Good luck."

08:20.291 --> 08:21.209
Not even close.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.335
But come on, seriously.

08:22.418 --> 08:24.670
When the bride's parents
are divorced like you,

08:24.754 --> 08:27.381
it's gotta be hard for the father
to keep a straight face

08:27.465 --> 08:29.926
-when talking to his future son-in-law.
-How's that?

08:30.009 --> 08:32.053
You're gonna be saying, "You realize, son,

08:32.135 --> 08:34.679
she's related to that bitch
in the corner."

08:34.764 --> 08:36.097
[audience laughing]

08:38.893 --> 08:40.144
No, no, it's fine.

08:40.227 --> 08:43.313
If you say it, it's a lawsuit.
If I say it, it's comedy.

08:43.397 --> 08:44.774
[audience laughing]

08:48.528 --> 08:50.655
-What do you think?
-I really can't comment.

08:51.906 --> 08:53.574
Oh, you're still paying, aren't you?

08:53.658 --> 08:55.493
[audience laughing]

08:55.576 --> 08:57.912
Keep telling jokes, puppet boy.

09:00.206 --> 09:03.626
So, are your daughter and her new husband
gonna have kids soon?

09:03.709 --> 09:05.044
I have no idea.

09:05.127 --> 09:07.463
-Oh, please encourage them to do that.
-Why?

09:07.547 --> 09:10.508
So, I can make fun of you
for having your own kids and grandkids

09:10.591 --> 09:12.051
that are the same age.

09:12.134 --> 09:13.844
[audience laughing]

09:14.428 --> 09:15.471
How screwed up is that?

09:15.555 --> 09:17.890
"Here you go, son.
Go change your uncle's diapers."

09:21.936 --> 09:24.855
-But seriously, more kids at your age?
-Why not?

09:24.939 --> 09:27.817
Because by the time your boys
are old enough to play ball with,

09:27.900 --> 09:30.653
your actual ones will be hanging down
to your ankles.

09:30.736 --> 09:31.946
[audience laughing]

09:32.863 --> 09:34.323
"Dad, wanna play kickball?"

09:34.407 --> 09:36.534
[mimics impact, then groaning]

09:37.368 --> 09:38.995
"I already am."

09:43.583 --> 09:45.668
-So, you really are adopted?
-Yes, I am.

09:45.751 --> 09:47.712
You ever tried to find the other ones?

09:47.795 --> 09:50.006
-My birth parents?
-Is that what they're called?

09:50.089 --> 09:51.757
-Birth parents?
-Typically.

09:51.841 --> 09:55.386
Yeah, they're the ones that had you,
took one look, and then dumped your ass.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.264
-I don't think that's how it went.
-Sure, it did.

09:58.347 --> 10:00.558
They handed you to a nurse
and went, "Run!"

10:00.641 --> 10:02.268
[audience laughing]

10:02.351 --> 10:03.185
I don't think so.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.521
Or maybe they got freaked out
when you cried

10:05.605 --> 10:08.232
and it sounded like it came from the kid
lying next to you.

10:08.316 --> 10:09.942
[audience laughing]

10:15.197 --> 10:16.574
I guess we'll never know.

10:17.158 --> 10:18.951
So, you never met your birth parents?

10:19.035 --> 10:20.328
-No.
-Right.

10:20.411 --> 10:21.787
So, when were you born?

10:21.871 --> 10:22.705
April.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.165
1961?

10:24.248 --> 10:25.499
-'62.
-What?

10:25.583 --> 10:26.792
April 1962.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.044
-In Dallas?
-Right?

10:28.127 --> 10:29.962
No, I meant I was in Dallas.

10:31.255 --> 10:32.673
[audience laughing]

10:34.550 --> 10:36.052
-Okay.
-For a few days.

10:38.554 --> 10:40.181
-Uh-huh.
-In '61.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.435
You and your wife.

10:45.061 --> 10:45.895
No.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.563
[audience laughing]

10:48.314 --> 10:49.148
Just me.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.068
Um...

10:52.610 --> 10:54.820
But you and your wife
were dating at the time.

10:54.904 --> 10:55.738
No.

10:55.946 --> 10:57.239
[audience laughing]

10:57.323 --> 10:58.407
I hadn't met her yet.

10:59.867 --> 11:04.580
Uh, were you dating anyone in July of '61?

11:04.664 --> 11:05.956
-No.
-Oh, good. [chuckles]

11:06.040 --> 11:07.375
Yeah, yeah.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.168
I'm not sure you call it "dating."

11:09.710 --> 11:11.962
[audience laughing]

11:12.046 --> 11:14.340
-What?
-Just watch the video.

11:15.591 --> 11:18.594
[funk music playing]

11:21.722 --> 11:23.766
[Walter]  It was the summer of love.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.434
And love was free.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.729
Unless you were paying for it.

11:29.855 --> 11:32.525
I was very popular with the ladies.

11:36.904 --> 11:38.322
Hey, baby.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.117
Wanna get down and feel the funk?

11:43.327 --> 11:44.537
[coughs]

11:47.790 --> 11:49.208
-[Jeff]  Walter.
-[Walter]  Calm down.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.292
It's not what you think.

11:50.376 --> 11:51.752
-We're jumping rope.
-What?

11:53.462 --> 11:57.842
Well, that's enough jump-roping
for tonight. Whatever-your-name-is.

11:58.759 --> 12:00.636
This rock's gotta roll.

12:05.433 --> 12:07.351
I'll never forget you.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.772
[audience applauding]

12:18.070 --> 12:18.904
Dad?

12:21.157 --> 12:22.032
Bastard?

12:22.116 --> 12:23.909
[audience laughing]

12:26.370 --> 12:28.080
-And who was the woman?
-I forgot.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.081
-You forgot?
-Yeah.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.041
Then what made you bring this up now?

12:31.125 --> 12:34.044
That old letter that Peanut found
in the back of the car,

12:34.462 --> 12:35.713
it had a photo with it.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.924
-Of who?
-Well, looks just like you.

12:39.758 --> 12:40.885
-What?
-You wanna see it?

12:41.302 --> 12:42.219
All right.

12:43.679 --> 12:45.014
[audience laughing]

12:52.480 --> 12:54.565
So, you're saying you think
you could be my--

12:54.648 --> 12:56.817
-Well, that's awful.
-How do you think I feel?

12:57.443 --> 13:01.530
I could have an adult son
who still plays with fucking dolls.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.073
[audience laughing]

13:03.699 --> 13:06.368
-Your wife's younger than you, right?
-Audrey is younger.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.621
-How much younger? It does.
-Doesn't matter.

13:09.246 --> 13:10.122
How much younger?

13:12.291 --> 13:13.125
Eighteen years.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.002
[audience whooping]

13:16.003 --> 13:20.049
I actually like you a lot more now, Jeff.

13:20.132 --> 13:21.717
[audience laughing, then applauding]

13:27.056 --> 13:29.850
-So, was it love at first sight?
-Pretty much.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.686
I wanted to say to her,
"Where you been all my life?"

13:32.770 --> 13:34.146
Yeah, and she would have said:

13:34.230 --> 13:36.607
"Well, for the first half,
I wasn't even born yet."

13:36.690 --> 13:37.775
[audience laughing]

13:39.610 --> 13:42.947
Eighteen years.
When you were 21, she was 3.

13:43.864 --> 13:46.075
You should be a registered sex offender.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.871
What was your pickup line when you met?
"Hey, kid, want some candy?"

13:50.955 --> 13:52.414
[audience laughing]

13:52.748 --> 13:54.833
Seriously, what did you do
on your first date?

13:54.917 --> 13:57.253
What, you take her shopping
for school supplies?

13:58.254 --> 13:59.880
You helped her with her homework?

14:00.422 --> 14:02.925
-We have chemistry.
-Class together.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.176
[audience laughing]

14:05.678 --> 14:06.929
Poor Audrey.

14:07.012 --> 14:08.013
Why "poor Audrey"?

14:08.097 --> 14:11.267
You know, whenever anyone sees
a younger woman with an older man,

14:11.350 --> 14:13.936
they automatically think
she married him for his money.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.938
-That is not what happened with us.
-No?

14:16.021 --> 14:18.899
No. In fact, when Audrey and I met,
she had never heard of me.

14:18.983 --> 14:20.568
She had no idea who I was.

14:20.651 --> 14:23.821
Of course not. Her parents wouldn't
let her watch the comedy channel.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.447
[audience laughing]

14:28.158 --> 14:30.244
She is more familiar with  Sesame Street.

14:31.912 --> 14:35.082
What, you sweep her off her feet
by doing Cookie Monster impressions?

14:35.749 --> 14:39.169
[as Cookie Monster] "Oh, I love Audrey.

14:39.253 --> 14:41.130
[audience laughing, then applauding]

14:46.093 --> 14:49.096
Do you want a kiss or a cookie?"

14:49.179 --> 14:53.058
[as Count] "You're one, two,
three times older than your wife."

14:54.852 --> 14:57.146
[in normal voice]
"Rubber Duckie, you're the one."

14:57.771 --> 14:59.773
[as Audrey] "Oh, Jeff, make it talk."

14:59.857 --> 15:01.150
[audience laughing]

15:03.777 --> 15:05.029
[in normal voice]
I'd love to have been there

15:05.112 --> 15:06.238
the first time her father had met you.

15:06.322 --> 15:08.115
He would have sounded like Scooby-Doo.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.491
[as Scooby-Doo] Huh?

15:11.327 --> 15:12.786
Uh-oh.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.289
[in normal voice]
Her mother would have sounded like Shaggy.

15:15.372 --> 15:16.290
[as Shaggy] Zoinks.

15:17.499 --> 15:19.627
[in normal voice] Then you got married
and had kids right away?

15:19.710 --> 15:21.921
-We waited a few years.
-Oh, yeah.

15:22.421 --> 15:24.590
Sometimes, you gotta let it build up,
don't you?

15:24.673 --> 15:25.758
[audience laughing]

15:26.550 --> 15:28.010
[sighs]

15:28.719 --> 15:31.430
But I think you're doing
the parenting thing a little late.

15:31.513 --> 15:32.806
I like being an older dad.

15:32.890 --> 15:35.517
Why? Because you all get
to wear diapers together?

15:35.601 --> 15:37.186
[audience laughing]

15:37.269 --> 15:38.354
[Walter sniffing]

15:38.437 --> 15:41.190
"Okay, who pooped their diaper?

15:42.483 --> 15:43.901
Dad."

15:44.902 --> 15:48.739
I've heard of parents trying to bond with
their kids, but you're taking it too far.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.867
There's great things
about being an older parent.

15:51.951 --> 15:56.163
Oh, yeah. At the movies, you get child
and senior citizen discounts.

15:56.246 --> 15:57.373
[audience laughing]

15:57.998 --> 15:59.708
Well, I guess they have good parents.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.670
Thank you. Did you have a good
relationship with your parents?

16:02.753 --> 16:03.921
Uh, kind of hit and miss.

16:04.004 --> 16:05.881
Sure. Sometimes good, sometimes bad.

16:05.965 --> 16:09.093
No, hit and miss. Sometimes I got hit,
and sometimes they missed.

16:09.176 --> 16:10.427
[audience laughing]

16:10.511 --> 16:12.846
-It was different back then.
-Sure.

16:12.930 --> 16:15.599
Back then, time out meant Mom
had knocked you senseless.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.853
-What about your dad?
-Oh, she hit him, too.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.480
[audience laughing]

16:23.315 --> 16:25.734
By the way, did I hear you
call yourself middle-aged?

16:25.818 --> 16:27.403
-That's right.
-And you're 55.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.530
-That's right.
-Yeah, being optimistic there,

16:29.613 --> 16:30.906
aren't you, chachi?

16:32.157 --> 16:35.077
Middle-aged, middle, the center, halfway.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.663
You are not gonna make it to 110.

16:37.746 --> 16:38.872
[audience laughing]

16:39.331 --> 16:43.711
And if you do, your kids are gonna
be like, "Dad, it's time to die.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.923
We're in our 70s now,
we have our own problems.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.467
Just fucking die."

16:50.551 --> 16:51.635
[audience laughing]

16:54.346 --> 16:57.641
It's gotta be weird, though, all the songs
that get stuck in your head.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.893
-Like what?
-The Beatles and the Teletubbies.

16:59.977 --> 17:01.687
[audience laughing]

17:01.770 --> 17:03.105
Baby, you could drive my car,

17:03.188 --> 17:05.398
and the wheels on the bus
go round and round.

17:06.483 --> 17:08.819
So, do you ever fall asleep with the kids?

17:09.111 --> 17:10.319
I do, and it's very sweet.

17:10.404 --> 17:13.156
Yeah. Not exactly what you imagined
when you fantasized

17:13.240 --> 17:15.117
about sleeping with twins, was it?

17:15.200 --> 17:17.077
[audience laughing]

17:17.744 --> 17:18.912
"Who's your daddy?"

17:20.998 --> 17:23.291
-Say good night, Walter.
-Thanks, Dublin.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.460
That's Walter.

17:24.542 --> 17:26.295
[audience cheering]

17:26.627 --> 17:27.671
[laughs]

17:32.342 --> 17:33.343
Thank you.

17:35.012 --> 17:38.182
So, there's another reason
that we're here in Dublin doing this show.

17:38.265 --> 17:40.809
I am adopted, as Walter talked about.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.979
And recently, I did the DNA thing
where you'd check your background

17:44.063 --> 17:48.150
of where you're from, and I found out
that I am a huge percentage

17:48.233 --> 17:49.693
of Irish descent.

17:49.777 --> 17:50.819
[audience cheering]

17:55.908 --> 18:00.412
And my act always reflects
what's going on in my real life.

18:00.496 --> 18:03.499
I have my three older daughters,
and now my two toddler sons,

18:03.582 --> 18:07.044
and we have a blended family,
and there's a lot of things to joke about.

18:07.127 --> 18:08.754
A lot of people can relate to that.

18:08.837 --> 18:11.673
That's what this special is all about,
it's all about family.

18:11.757 --> 18:14.593
But we came to Ireland, because you guys
are great audiences,

18:14.676 --> 18:16.512
but also because I'm following my roots.

18:16.595 --> 18:19.139
Also, Audrey and I have done
due diligence about this.

18:19.223 --> 18:20.265
We're happy about it,

18:20.349 --> 18:23.519
but we know there a lot of babies
here in Ireland that need homes.

18:23.602 --> 18:26.563
And so, while we're here,
we're gonna be adopting an Irish baby.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.107
[audience cheering]

18:31.360 --> 18:32.820
[audience laughing]

18:38.283 --> 18:39.493
And his name is Seamus.

18:50.879 --> 18:51.797
Hi, Seamus.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.674
Little baby Seamus, so cute.

18:54.550 --> 18:55.717
Goo, goo, goo, goo.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.345
Cootchie, cootchie, cootchie-coo.

19:00.973 --> 19:04.226
Touch me like that again
and I'll bite your fucking arm off.

19:04.309 --> 19:06.478
[audience laughing, then cheering]

19:21.201 --> 19:23.495
-I'm sorry. I thought you were a baby.
-I am.

19:24.538 --> 19:28.083
-You sound quite a bit older than that.
-That's what a few pints a day

19:28.167 --> 19:29.334
will do to you.

19:30.919 --> 19:32.713
-Pints, you mean beer?
-That's right.

19:32.796 --> 19:35.841
-What happened to drinking from a bottle?
-Oh, now you're talking.

19:35.924 --> 19:37.092
[audience laughing]

19:37.759 --> 19:39.720
I take whiskey as well.

19:40.596 --> 19:43.432
-No, a baby bottle.
-I don't care what it is.

19:43.515 --> 19:47.561
If it's 90 proof or better,
I'll take it from a fucking tin can.

19:47.686 --> 19:48.854
[audience laughing]

19:50.355 --> 19:52.691
-Don't you wanna be breastfed?
-Don't we all?

19:52.774 --> 19:53.901
[audience laughing]

19:55.694 --> 19:57.196
[audience cheering]

20:02.993 --> 20:05.871
But, Seamus, why did you start
drinking alcohol so early?

20:05.954 --> 20:07.539
Oh, well...

20:07.623 --> 20:11.501
Uh, I saw the size of my John Thomas.

20:11.585 --> 20:12.878
[audience laughing]

20:13.795 --> 20:15.589
-Your what?
-My winky.

20:16.924 --> 20:19.676
-Oh, well, that will change.
-I hope so.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.846
What if a woman looked at you
when your knickers were down and said,

20:22.930 --> 20:24.681
"Well, that's a cute one."

20:24.765 --> 20:26.016
[audience laughing]

20:26.391 --> 20:28.769
You'd be hammered all the time as well.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.897
-You'll be fine.
-If not, later in life,

20:31.980 --> 20:35.067
I'll have to drive
a really nice sports car.

20:37.152 --> 20:39.238
[audience laughing]

20:39.821 --> 20:41.990
Wait a minute. I have a nice sports car.

20:42.532 --> 20:43.408
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.244
[audience laughing]

20:45.369 --> 20:47.996
Well, at least you have a big head.
[laughing]

20:51.208 --> 20:54.586
Do you know who the first person
to comment on that was?

20:54.670 --> 20:55.963
-Who?
-My ma.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.633
-What did she say?
-Oh, something along the lines of:

20:59.716 --> 21:01.760
[screaming]

21:03.136 --> 21:06.181
I think a C-section
might have been a bit easier.

21:07.140 --> 21:08.767
-Really?
-Well, it's the difference

21:08.850 --> 21:12.271
between you opening a convertible top
and getting out of the car that way

21:12.354 --> 21:15.274
versus having your arse
shoved out the keyhole.

21:15.399 --> 21:16.608
[audience laughing]

21:21.154 --> 21:23.865
Well, I hope you're happy
with Audrey and me adopting you.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.368
Sure. And if it doesn't work out,

21:26.451 --> 21:29.288
I'll just go live with Angelina Jolie
and Brad Pitt.

21:29.371 --> 21:30.414
[audience laughing]

21:30.914 --> 21:34.209
They need a kid from Ireland
to complete the collection.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.922
I guess you don't know, Seamus,
but they're divorced.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.507
Oh, well, too bad.

21:40.590 --> 21:42.926
I'm probably too white for them anyway.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.469
[audience laughing and groaning]

21:45.137 --> 21:47.347
Oh, fuck you, that's a good joke.

21:47.431 --> 21:48.807
[audience laughing, then cheering]

21:55.564 --> 21:58.400
What do you like to play with?
Was that a baby rattle I heard?

21:58.483 --> 22:01.528
Actually, I think that was Walter's
artificial hip.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.406
[Walter] Asshole!

22:04.489 --> 22:05.949
[audience laughing]

22:06.658 --> 22:10.203
Look, Seamus, have you been enjoying
everything with us so far?

22:10.287 --> 22:12.581
Oh, I like all your friends in the trunks.

22:12.873 --> 22:15.334
-I've asked the guys to leave you alone.
-Why?

22:15.417 --> 22:18.295
I don't think they'd be
a very good influence on a baby.

22:18.378 --> 22:20.964
Everything's fine. If not, I'd kill you.

22:21.048 --> 22:22.215
[laughing]

22:23.675 --> 22:25.844
-That's what I mean.
-If you think that's dark,

22:25.927 --> 22:29.222
you should see what Bubba J's
been doing with the breast pump.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.349
[audience laughing]

22:31.433 --> 22:33.852
I'm never drinking from that thing again.

22:35.729 --> 22:37.814
-By the way, who taught you to curse?
-Peanut.

22:38.940 --> 22:40.192
Babies should not curse.

22:40.275 --> 22:42.444
I know. That guy's an asshole.

22:42.527 --> 22:43.904
[audience laughing]

22:43.987 --> 22:46.740
-Say, is Achmed around?
-He is. Why?

22:46.823 --> 22:49.951
I wanna show him how I can set off
a bomb in my nappy.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.664
I could clear this room right now.

22:55.749 --> 22:58.335
Are you looking forward
to living in the United States?

22:58.418 --> 23:00.545
I don't think I'm going to care
for your pubs.

23:01.004 --> 23:02.339
Our pubs? Why is that?

23:02.422 --> 23:03.507
They close.

23:03.924 --> 23:05.217
[audience laughing]

23:05.592 --> 23:07.302
Who the fuck does that?

23:08.303 --> 23:10.222
Look, is there anything you'd like to do,

23:10.305 --> 23:12.265
or see right away
when you get to the U.S.?

23:12.349 --> 23:14.017
I'd like to see Mount Rushmore.

23:14.309 --> 23:16.895
You know about that.
That's the giant mountain carving

23:16.978 --> 23:18.897
with four of our most famous presidents.

23:18.980 --> 23:21.024
Can you name our presidents
by their heads?

23:22.484 --> 23:23.902
[audience laughing]

23:24.361 --> 23:26.404
Is this a Bill Clinton question?

23:26.947 --> 23:28.448
[audience laughing]

23:33.161 --> 23:34.037
[audience applauding]

23:38.166 --> 23:40.794
So, at this age,
you already know about politics?

23:40.877 --> 23:43.588
-For sure.
-What do you know about Donald Trump?

23:43.672 --> 23:46.216
I think he could have been
my mom's doctor.

23:47.717 --> 23:49.678
-Why is that?
-How do you think I was born?

23:49.761 --> 23:50.971
He grabbed her by the pu--

23:51.054 --> 23:51.972
[shouts]

23:53.849 --> 23:57.352
But from what I could see,
I liked him better than his opponent.

23:57.435 --> 23:59.271
-Hillary Clinton?
-That's the guy.

23:59.396 --> 24:00.564
[audience laughing]

24:01.189 --> 24:02.691
-No, she's a woman.
-Really?

24:02.774 --> 24:05.944
-Mm-hm.
-Maybe I am drinking a wee bit too much.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.281
And I like all your news channels.

24:09.364 --> 24:11.491
What's the one with all foxes on it?

24:12.075 --> 24:13.118
-Fox News.
-Yeah.

24:13.201 --> 24:15.328
The one with all the young ladies
and their huge--

24:15.412 --> 24:16.371
Ah-ah.

24:17.622 --> 24:18.832
--personalities.

24:18.915 --> 24:19.749
[audience laughing]

24:20.792 --> 24:22.377
Hanging out. [laughs]

24:23.545 --> 24:26.548
I watch ten minutes of that,
and I'm starving.

24:26.631 --> 24:28.049
[audience laughing]

24:31.428 --> 24:34.890
-That reminds me. I got a joke for you.
-All right.

24:35.098 --> 24:38.101
Do you know why chicken breasts
don't have nipples?

24:40.937 --> 24:42.606
-Why?
-Because if you froze them,

24:42.689 --> 24:44.608
they'd poke a hole in the package.

24:44.691 --> 24:45.859
[audience laughing]

24:46.651 --> 24:48.278
[Seamus laughing]

24:53.658 --> 24:56.912
Say, you never told me
what happened to my real mother.

24:56.995 --> 24:59.414
Oh, I thought you knew.
She gave you up for adoption.

24:59.497 --> 25:02.083
Oh, she did, now? And why would that be?

25:02.667 --> 25:05.670
I was told that the main reason
was because she was an alcoholic.

25:05.754 --> 25:06.880
That was the best part.

25:08.632 --> 25:12.177
-What?
-Her milk tasted like Baileys Irish Cream.

25:12.260 --> 25:13.929
[audience laughing]

25:14.346 --> 25:17.224
-And you know why they took me from her?
-Not exactly.

25:17.307 --> 25:19.935
She tried to make me
her designated driver.

25:20.018 --> 25:21.686
[audience laughing]

25:22.562 --> 25:26.358
And by the way, why did you keep pulling
your diaper off last night at the hotel?

25:26.775 --> 25:29.653
Uh... Sometimes,
the boys need a little air.

25:29.736 --> 25:31.404
[audience laughing]

25:31.988 --> 25:33.031
We were in the lobby.

25:34.991 --> 25:35.867
Boys' night out.

25:35.951 --> 25:37.535
[audience laughing]

25:40.705 --> 25:41.998
[audience cheering]

25:44.751 --> 25:47.045
-Say, I've got another one for you.
-What?

25:47.128 --> 25:50.090
Do you know what a baby calls
a topless woman?

25:50.173 --> 25:51.591
-What?
-A free bar.

25:51.675 --> 25:52.926
[laughing]

25:53.635 --> 25:55.595
-Walter told me that one.
-Oh, he did?

25:56.221 --> 25:58.265
[Walter laughing]

25:58.348 --> 25:59.557
[audience laughing]

25:59.683 --> 26:01.601
Uh, you do know
we have twin boys at home

26:01.685 --> 26:04.396
-who are gonna be your new brothers.
-Oh, sounds lovely.

26:04.479 --> 26:05.814
I hate to drink alone.

26:07.440 --> 26:08.858
They don't drink alcohol.

26:08.942 --> 26:10.568
Baby steps.

26:12.153 --> 26:13.530
Are you sure they're twins?

26:13.613 --> 26:15.740
-Of course.
-Maybe you're just seeing double.

26:17.075 --> 26:20.537
That happens to me a lot. The other day,
I thought I'd hit the mother lode.

26:20.620 --> 26:21.913
-How is that?
-Four nipples.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.081
[audience laughing]

26:23.540 --> 26:25.875
-And you say your boys are twins.
-They are.

26:25.959 --> 26:27.794
You told your wife to make it a double.

26:27.877 --> 26:29.087
[laughing]

26:29.587 --> 26:30.588
What are their names?

26:30.964 --> 26:33.675
-Jack.
-Oh, as in Jack Daniels?

26:34.592 --> 26:35.719
Sure. And James.

26:35.802 --> 26:37.554
Like Jameson Whiskey?

26:38.555 --> 26:40.682
I love this fucking family.

26:40.765 --> 26:41.599
[audience laughing]

26:42.309 --> 26:43.310
[audience cheering]

26:50.108 --> 26:51.609
So, Seamus, can you walk yet?

26:51.693 --> 26:54.279
No, not yet, but I can do the pub crawl.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.950
-I don't think you should be in a pub.
-Why not?

26:59.034 --> 27:02.287
I can barely hold my head up,
I keep falling over, and I can't walk.

27:03.121 --> 27:04.581
I fit right in.

27:05.915 --> 27:07.917
How can someone your age be at a pub?

27:08.001 --> 27:10.920
Oh, all the drunks just think
I'm a leprechaun.

27:11.004 --> 27:12.505
[audience laughing]

27:12.589 --> 27:14.716
I got thrown out of the pub
the other night.

27:14.799 --> 27:17.552
-What did you do?
-I tried to show off my lucky charms.

27:18.887 --> 27:22.474
To make it worse, I yelled
that they were magically delicious.

27:23.641 --> 27:26.561
And that's Seamus, our new Irish baby.

27:26.644 --> 27:28.146
[audience cheering]

27:29.731 --> 27:30.565
They like it?

27:36.905 --> 27:39.866
So, this next guy is from somewhere
down south in the U.S.

27:39.949 --> 27:41.868
Please, help me welcome Bubba J.

27:41.951 --> 27:43.411
[audience cheering]

27:49.501 --> 27:51.378
[laughing]

27:51.711 --> 27:55.256
-How are you doing, Bubba J?
-I'm doing pretty good.

27:55.340 --> 27:56.424
[audience cheering]

27:57.384 --> 27:59.886
-What do you think so far?
-Well, I've been listening,

27:59.969 --> 28:02.597
and I think this is one
of the best audiences

28:02.680 --> 28:04.516
we have ever had.

28:04.599 --> 28:06.017
[audience cheering]

28:10.855 --> 28:14.109
-Well, that's nice of you to say, Bubba J.
-Well, yeah, I'm drunk.

28:14.192 --> 28:15.985
-So, I actually don't know.
-Okay.

28:16.444 --> 28:17.362
-You're drunk?
-Yeah.

28:17.445 --> 28:19.781
I've been in the trunk
with that Irish kid.

28:20.323 --> 28:22.158
[laughing]

28:22.242 --> 28:25.286
He talks funny,
but he can drink me under the table.

28:26.413 --> 28:27.747
[laughing]

28:27.831 --> 28:28.873
[yells]

28:33.336 --> 28:34.546
The hell is that?

28:35.588 --> 28:36.548
Oh, it's me.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.592
It's your baby picture.

28:40.093 --> 28:42.387
I thought those photos
are supposed to be cute.

28:43.304 --> 28:45.557
I look like Gollum from  Lord of the Rings.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.016
[audience laughing]

28:47.642 --> 28:51.354
Hey, that reminds me. I was
on the tour bus a little earlier today.

28:51.438 --> 28:53.690
-Yeah.
-I was talking to the other guys.

28:53.773 --> 28:57.193
They're talking about some guy around here
they saw who was in his 50's.

28:57.277 --> 29:00.238
-Yeah?
-He and his wife just had twins. Ha, ha.

29:00.321 --> 29:02.240
How stupid is that?

29:03.658 --> 29:06.619
Hey, I wonder who drools more,
him or the kids.

29:06.703 --> 29:07.787
[wails]

29:07.871 --> 29:12.000
Yeah, you can give him a baby shower,
but at his age, that'd be a sponge bath.

29:12.083 --> 29:13.001
[laughing]

29:13.376 --> 29:16.045
And when he takes his kids to college,
folks will be like:

29:16.129 --> 29:19.382
"Hey, it's parents weekend.
Why'd you bring your grandpa?"

29:19.466 --> 29:20.925
[Bubba J and audience laughing]

29:23.344 --> 29:25.764
-What?
-Bubba J, you're talking about me.

29:26.806 --> 29:29.309
You took your grandpa to parents weekend?

29:31.019 --> 29:34.272
No, I'm the 55-year-old guy
that has baby twins.

29:34.647 --> 29:36.232
[Bubba J squeals]

29:38.443 --> 29:40.069
Does your wife know?

29:40.153 --> 29:41.738
[audience laughing]

29:41.821 --> 29:43.656
She had the twins. I'm the father.

29:43.740 --> 29:45.909
-Oh, good for you.
-Thanks.

29:46.326 --> 29:49.537
Yeah, I forgot I went
and visited your boys the other day.

29:49.662 --> 29:51.414
-How did that go?
-Well, like I said,

29:51.498 --> 29:53.541
I forgot. I was drunk. Surprise.

29:54.584 --> 29:57.378
But I do remember
they are good-looking little boys.

29:57.462 --> 29:59.589
-Thank you.
-And your wife is pretty, too.

29:59.672 --> 30:02.383
Well, thank you. And I'm sure
your wife is beautiful as well.

30:02.467 --> 30:03.968
[chuckles] No.

30:04.052 --> 30:05.512
[audience laughing]

30:05.595 --> 30:08.014
-No?
-Well, maybe after a six-pack.

30:08.097 --> 30:09.182
[laughs]

30:09.724 --> 30:11.059
How about after five beers?

30:11.142 --> 30:12.685
Too soon, too soon.

30:14.062 --> 30:15.730
But your wife really had twins?

30:15.814 --> 30:17.649
-She did.
-Which one of them's yours?

30:19.526 --> 30:22.111
-They both are.
-Oh, you dog.

30:23.404 --> 30:26.699
You know, come to think of it,
I got twin kids of my own.

30:26.783 --> 30:27.784
You have twins as well?

30:27.867 --> 30:28.868
-Uh-huh.
-I didn't know that.

30:28.952 --> 30:30.954
-Yeah.
-Well, are yours easy to tell apart?

30:31.037 --> 30:33.248
Not really, but I'm getting better at it.

30:33.331 --> 30:36.584
I know Tommy is 9, and Mary is 3.

30:36.668 --> 30:37.877
[audience laughing]

30:38.503 --> 30:39.838
And she's black.

30:41.589 --> 30:42.966
Your daughter is black?

30:43.049 --> 30:46.135
Yeah, that was a tough one
to explain to my wife.

30:46.219 --> 30:47.345
[audience laughing]

30:50.640 --> 30:52.141
[audience applauding]

30:58.314 --> 30:59.148
Wait, what?

30:59.232 --> 31:03.695
Well, I had to swear up and down
that I had not slept with a black woman.

31:08.616 --> 31:10.827
Bubba J, your wife gave birth
to the child.

31:10.910 --> 31:13.788
I know, and she's gonna be pissed off
when she figures out

31:13.872 --> 31:15.915
that kid might not be hers.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.208
[audience laughing]

31:21.671 --> 31:23.548
Hey, are your twins attached?

31:23.923 --> 31:24.883
[laughs]

31:25.925 --> 31:27.218
No, they're not conjoined.

31:27.302 --> 31:28.595
[laughing]

31:29.596 --> 31:30.430
What?

31:30.930 --> 31:33.141
-They're not conjoined.
-Conjoined?

31:34.642 --> 31:38.938
I like that. "Here come them Dunham boys.
Conjoined, conjoined, conjoined."

31:39.022 --> 31:40.231
-But they're not?
-No.

31:40.315 --> 31:43.776
That's too bad, 'cause you could have had
all them two-for-one specials.

31:45.320 --> 31:49.157
When you go out in public,
you'd never have to say, "Stay together."

31:50.450 --> 31:53.119
'Cause they're already conjoined,
conjoined, conjoined.

31:53.369 --> 31:54.829
No, they're not Siamese twins.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.539
No, they're American twins.

31:56.623 --> 31:58.291
[audience laughing]

31:59.626 --> 32:01.210
[audience cheering]

32:05.256 --> 32:08.760
So, for twins, did you,
"chica, womp, womp," in a twin bed?

32:13.973 --> 32:15.808
No, Bubba J. That's not how it works.

32:16.225 --> 32:18.895
The kind of bed you have
does not impact the child.

32:18.978 --> 32:21.314
I don't know. My brother's a queen.

32:21.814 --> 32:23.149
[audience laughing]

32:31.491 --> 32:33.743
-And my sister's king-sized.
-Oh.

32:34.827 --> 32:35.995
[as Fat Albert] Hey, hey, hey.

32:37.121 --> 32:38.873
-[in normal voice] Why did you have two?
-Well--

32:38.957 --> 32:40.124
In case you dropped one?

32:41.542 --> 32:42.752
-No.
-My mama swears

32:42.835 --> 32:44.796
I was not the twin she dropped.

32:45.713 --> 32:47.090
Oh, so, you're a twin as well?

32:47.173 --> 32:48.591
[chuckles] No.

32:49.884 --> 32:51.844
You said you weren't the twin she dropped.

32:51.928 --> 32:53.429
Right, 'cause I wasn't a twin.

32:55.390 --> 32:56.224
Duh.

32:57.809 --> 32:59.769
-So, she did drop you?
-Well, yeah.

33:01.437 --> 33:03.481
You're not real smart, are you, Jeff?

33:05.316 --> 33:07.819
-Are your twins identical?
-No, they're fraternal.

33:07.902 --> 33:09.487
Oh, they're in a sorority.

33:10.071 --> 33:11.572
[audience laughing]

33:12.573 --> 33:15.118
I'd love to have more kids of my own,
but my doctor said

33:15.201 --> 33:17.203
my squigglers are too drunk to swim.

33:18.329 --> 33:22.166
Yeah, they're like drunk drivers veering
off the road and crashing into bushes.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.751
[audience laughing]

33:33.886 --> 33:36.973
So, Bubba J, did you date a lot of women
before you got married?

33:37.056 --> 33:38.099
Just my wife.

33:38.182 --> 33:40.768
Oh, good for you.
You married your childhood sweetheart.

33:40.852 --> 33:43.479
Oh, no, I didn't marry my dog.

33:43.563 --> 33:44.981
[audience laughing]

33:45.732 --> 33:47.775
I meant the first girl
you fell in love with.

33:47.859 --> 33:50.236
Oh, you know, she had her stomach stapled.

33:50.319 --> 33:51.779
Oh, she's a big girl?

33:51.863 --> 33:54.365
No, she's a centerfold in a magazine.

33:54.449 --> 33:55.408
[audience laughing]

34:04.876 --> 34:07.336
Say, did your wife boob-feed your kids?

34:07.420 --> 34:09.547
[chuckles] Breastfeed.

34:09.630 --> 34:10.922
[giggling]

34:12.007 --> 34:13.259
You said breast.

34:14.510 --> 34:16.054
-Yes, she did.
-In public?

34:16.137 --> 34:17.388
-Not a lot.
-Mine did.

34:17.472 --> 34:18.806
-Yeah.
-I tried not to look.

34:18.889 --> 34:20.558
-Right.
-You're not supposed to look.

34:20.641 --> 34:22.601
-Right.
-You're a pervert if you look.

34:22.768 --> 34:24.603
-Right.
-That's where my wandering eye

34:24.687 --> 34:25.730
comes in handy.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.398
[audience laughing]

34:28.440 --> 34:32.110
I'm looking over here,
but I'm also looking over here.

34:32.195 --> 34:35.489
Whoo! Look at that! [laughs]

34:35.572 --> 34:39.619
So, you got two toddlers at home
and also two kids in college.

34:39.702 --> 34:41.286
-That's right.
-Think about this.

34:41.370 --> 34:42.871
Which ones throw up more?

34:42.955 --> 34:44.623
[Bubba J and audience laughing]

34:46.708 --> 34:47.793
[Jeff] Hmm.

34:53.549 --> 34:57.720
-So, it's five kids from two marriages.
-That's right. I have a blended family.

34:58.137 --> 34:59.097
That ain't blended.

34:59.222 --> 35:02.892
I got a cousin who has a kid
that's half human and half donkey.

35:02.975 --> 35:03.893
[laughs]

35:04.727 --> 35:06.229
That's blended right there.

35:06.979 --> 35:10.858
Their Christmas card looks like something
went horribly wrong at the manger.

35:13.277 --> 35:15.279
-The manger?
-Well, I think it's a manger,

35:15.363 --> 35:18.741
'cause every time somebody looks
at the picture, they go, "Jesus Christ!"

35:18.825 --> 35:20.118
[audience laughing]

35:21.786 --> 35:23.037
[audience applauding]

35:28.835 --> 35:29.877
Anything else going on?

35:29.961 --> 35:32.421
Well, I'm no longer looking for work.

35:32.672 --> 35:36.884
-Oh, good. So, you found a job?
-No, I'm just no longer looking for work.

35:38.261 --> 35:39.929
Is there a job you're interested in?

35:40.012 --> 35:41.472
-Well--
-What do you like to do?

35:41.722 --> 35:43.975
-I like doing this.
-You like talking to people?

35:44.058 --> 35:46.602
-Uh-huh.
-Well, are you up on social issues?

35:46.686 --> 35:49.397
Well, one time, I caught
something from a girl,

35:49.480 --> 35:52.024
and it itched, so I had to get a shot.

35:55.862 --> 35:56.696
What?

35:56.904 --> 35:59.407
Not a social disease, a social issue.

35:59.949 --> 36:02.201
Oh, I thought those are the same thing.

36:02.285 --> 36:03.244
[audience laughing]

36:03.828 --> 36:05.830
It itched, and that was an issue.

36:05.913 --> 36:07.623
[audience laughing]

36:08.249 --> 36:09.834
Especially socially.

36:11.586 --> 36:13.462
No, issues within the community.

36:13.546 --> 36:16.257
Oh, yeah, she's spread it
around the whole damn community.

36:17.717 --> 36:19.927
In fact, I feel like scratching right now.

36:21.262 --> 36:23.431
But my arms ain't long enough.

36:25.766 --> 36:27.560
[audience laughing]

36:30.188 --> 36:32.440
Look, Bubba J, have you ever gotten a job?

36:33.274 --> 36:34.859
You mean, from that girl?

36:38.654 --> 36:39.572
[laughs]

36:40.573 --> 36:42.700
[audience cheering]

36:46.329 --> 36:47.663
No, a paying job.

36:48.206 --> 36:49.665
Well, I offered her ten bucks.

36:51.125 --> 36:54.212
Look, Bubba J, you like talking to people,
and you care about them.

36:54.295 --> 36:56.297
-Yeah.
-You pay attention to the community.

36:56.380 --> 36:58.633
-Sure.
-Well, you could be in politics.

36:58.716 --> 36:59.967
-I could?
-Absolutely.

37:00.051 --> 37:02.887
-I really do like to get things done.
-Really?

37:02.970 --> 37:05.306
No, I'm just fucking with you.
I don't care.

37:06.515 --> 37:08.684
Look, aren't you worried
about Big Brother?

37:08.768 --> 37:10.603
Well, yeah, that guy's also my uncle.

37:15.858 --> 37:18.736
-Wait, your brother's also your unc--
-Don't even try.

37:20.488 --> 37:23.241
It's like arithmetic, it will F you up.

37:24.784 --> 37:27.286
Look, Bubba J, in politics,
you have to give speeches.

37:27.370 --> 37:29.288
-Can you do that?
-Oh, yeah. I memorized one.

37:29.372 --> 37:32.792
Ahem. I did not have sex with that woman.

37:32.875 --> 37:34.460
[audience laughing, then cheering]

37:42.343 --> 37:44.804
Bubba J, that reference
is almost 20 years old.

37:44.887 --> 37:45.846
-Really?
-Yeah.

37:45.930 --> 37:46.973
Oh, okay.

37:47.056 --> 37:50.101
I did not have sex with that little girl.

37:52.895 --> 37:53.771
Oh, shit. Too far?

37:53.854 --> 37:54.981
-Too far.
-Okay.

37:56.482 --> 37:58.442
Do you have any experience with debate?

37:58.526 --> 38:01.112
Oh, sure. I use de-bait to catch the fish.

38:01.195 --> 38:02.446
[laughing]

38:08.828 --> 38:11.956
And then I can pull up some chain-link
between the U.S. and Mexico

38:12.039 --> 38:13.791
and hire a secretary of defense.

38:13.874 --> 38:15.584
[laughing]

38:15.668 --> 38:18.004
I'm killing.
This some funny shit, right here.

38:19.005 --> 38:22.591
Look, Bubba J, if you were in office,
would you reduce the unemployment rate?

38:22.675 --> 38:24.051
Well, yeah, by one.

38:27.388 --> 38:29.307
-'Cause I got the job.
-I know.

38:33.269 --> 38:35.688
-What about everyone else?
-I'd make another speech.

38:35.771 --> 38:38.607
Ahem. Get a job, you lazy bastards!

38:40.067 --> 38:43.779
Look, Bubba J, with your appeal, I think
you could reach out to young people.

38:43.863 --> 38:46.949
Well, my uncle tried that.
He got put on a list.

38:47.033 --> 38:48.200
[audience laughing]

38:53.122 --> 38:55.541
I'm saying,
you should get out and press the flesh.

38:55.624 --> 38:57.793
-No, that's what he did.
-No, no...

38:59.003 --> 39:01.130
You don't know
what "press the flesh" means?

39:01.213 --> 39:04.759
Well, one time, I sat on my own nuts.
Is that it?

39:06.052 --> 39:07.553
I don't know how I did it.

39:08.471 --> 39:09.847
It must have been hot out.

39:10.723 --> 39:12.641
Ain't never been the same, you know.

39:13.267 --> 39:15.436
That's when my eye went crooked.

39:15.519 --> 39:16.687
[audience laughing]

39:17.146 --> 39:19.023
I was drunk when it happened.

39:19.732 --> 39:23.277
I'm pretty sure that's where
the phrase "beer nuts" came from.

39:24.195 --> 39:27.448
-Say good night, Bubba J.
-Thanks, Dublin!

39:27.531 --> 39:29.658
[audience cheering]

39:31.118 --> 39:32.203
-Good job.
-Thank you.

39:38.250 --> 39:40.544
Well, thank you.

39:41.754 --> 39:43.964
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have said it before,

39:44.048 --> 39:46.509
and I will say it again with pride.

39:46.675 --> 39:49.720
Please help me welcome
the world's favorite terrorist,

39:49.804 --> 39:51.889
Achmed the Dead Terrorist.

39:51.972 --> 39:53.265
[audience cheering]

40:05.236 --> 40:09.824
Greetings, Irish infidels!

40:13.786 --> 40:15.037
Good to see you, Achmed.

40:15.121 --> 40:19.083
Oh, it is good to see you, too,
infidel number one.

40:20.042 --> 40:22.002
Thank you. You're in a good mood. Why?

40:22.086 --> 40:24.463
-I cannot believe I am here.
-Why?

40:24.547 --> 40:28.467
Because I was detained at your airport
for days.

40:28.551 --> 40:29.969
[audience laughing]

40:30.553 --> 40:31.720
Why were you detained?

40:34.723 --> 40:36.559
-Seriously?
-Well--

40:36.642 --> 40:40.604
I was detained, because everyone here
thinks I look like a terrorist.

40:41.230 --> 40:43.858
-But you are a terrorist.
-That's racial profiling.

40:44.817 --> 40:47.945
-But in this case, everyone is right.
-You are violating my rights.

40:48.028 --> 40:50.906
-What rights? You're a terrorist.
-It's in your constitution.

40:50.990 --> 40:53.200
-We're not in the United States.
-Same shit.

40:54.660 --> 40:57.663
-What--?
-Freedom of the pressing of buttons.

40:58.706 --> 41:01.917
-No such thing.
-Freedom to assemble shit and blow it up.

41:02.001 --> 41:02.960
[audience laughing]

41:03.043 --> 41:04.170
-Wrong--
-Stop laughing!

41:05.421 --> 41:06.755
What happened at the airport?

41:06.839 --> 41:09.842
I'm in line, and the Immigration guy goes,
"We are vetting you."

41:09.925 --> 41:11.552
I never heard that word, "vetting."

41:11.635 --> 41:13.637
I thought he was gonna kick dirt
on my dog.

41:14.305 --> 41:15.681
-Wait, you have a dog?
-Yes.

41:15.764 --> 41:17.641
-What kind?
-The pain-in-the-ass kind.

41:18.350 --> 41:19.935
-What's his name?
-Little Bastard.

41:21.312 --> 41:23.731
-Why'd you name him that?
-I think it's funny to say:

41:23.814 --> 41:25.107
"Come here, Little Bastard."

41:26.901 --> 41:28.444
-Is he a good dog?
-No.

41:28.527 --> 41:30.905
-Why?
-He's always trying to play fetch with me.

41:32.698 --> 41:35.367
-That's good.
-No, not with me. With me.

41:35.659 --> 41:36.785
It's not funny.

41:36.869 --> 41:37.953
[audience laughing]

41:38.037 --> 41:41.165
If I yell, "Fetch, boy,"
he grabs my leg and runs like hell.

41:41.665 --> 41:42.666
Stop laughing!

41:43.584 --> 41:45.586
You think the sand on me
is from the desert?

41:45.669 --> 41:48.214
No, Little Bastard buried my ass
in the fucking beach.

41:48.297 --> 41:49.590
[audience laughing]

41:50.466 --> 41:51.550
It's not funny.

41:51.634 --> 41:52.760
[audience applauding]

41:57.723 --> 42:01.185
-So, what happened at the airport?
-The Immigration guy yelled at me.

42:01.268 --> 42:03.145
He goes, "Why are you in this country?"

42:03.229 --> 42:05.439
-What'd you say?
-It scared the crap out of me.

42:05.523 --> 42:07.399
I panicked and just blurted it out.

42:07.483 --> 42:08.984
"I'm here to blow up shit."

42:10.694 --> 42:13.405
-That's when he detained you?
-And he did a cavity search.

42:13.948 --> 42:15.324
It's not funny. Look at me.

42:15.407 --> 42:18.869
Find a place on me where there's a cavity
that I can hide stuff. Nowhere!

42:19.328 --> 42:21.455
I didn't even have cavities in my teeth.

42:22.039 --> 42:25.334
-Really?
-No, I floss after every meal. Yup.

42:25.417 --> 42:28.128
-Well, how about under that?
-Don't touch my turban.

42:28.212 --> 42:29.880
-What's under there?
-Under where?

42:29.964 --> 42:31.465
[audience laughing]

42:34.593 --> 42:36.136
What are they laughing at?

42:36.220 --> 42:37.930
-Well, I said, "under there."
-Yes?

42:38.013 --> 42:39.348
And you said, "underwear."

42:41.642 --> 42:43.060
[audience laughing]

42:43.143 --> 42:44.478
What are they laughing at?

42:45.062 --> 42:47.439
You said you have underwear on your head.

42:48.065 --> 42:49.650
That's not even a sentence.

42:50.776 --> 42:51.819
-Underwear.
-Where?

42:51.902 --> 42:53.195
No, underpants.

42:53.654 --> 42:55.531
What? I don't wear underpants.

42:55.906 --> 42:56.824
Don't look.

42:56.907 --> 42:57.825
[laughs]

42:58.450 --> 42:59.910
I free no ball.

43:01.620 --> 43:03.122
[Walter laughing]

43:03.247 --> 43:04.540
[audience laughing]

43:11.005 --> 43:12.881
So, how'd you get away from Immigration?

43:12.965 --> 43:15.175
Easy. I put my leg
in Little Bastard's mouth

43:15.259 --> 43:16.510
and yelled, "Fetch!"

43:17.636 --> 43:20.097
He dragged me all the way here.
Here I am, yay.

43:20.889 --> 43:22.141
But now I have a headache.

43:22.224 --> 43:24.101
-Are you getting sick?
-Just a headache.

43:24.184 --> 43:26.562
-You could be getting sick.
-It's just a headache.

43:26.645 --> 43:28.355
-It really could--
-Read my lips.

43:29.148 --> 43:29.982
I mean...

43:30.524 --> 43:32.943
Shit. Read my teeth. Read my damn teeth.

43:33.527 --> 43:35.863
-It's just a headache.
-Have you had enough water?

43:36.280 --> 43:37.156
What?

43:37.531 --> 43:39.950
Some people don't realize
how important water is.

43:40.034 --> 43:43.704
It's really important. And sometimes
if you don't drink it, you get dehydrated,

43:43.787 --> 43:46.999
You don't know it, you get a headache.
It's really good for your skin.

43:47.082 --> 43:48.167
[audience laughing]

43:48.250 --> 43:49.335
Silence!

43:50.085 --> 43:51.420
I kill you!

43:51.503 --> 43:52.421
[audience cheering]

43:57.134 --> 43:58.594
Oh, thank you.

43:59.011 --> 43:59.928
Thank you.

44:00.262 --> 44:01.263
Thank you.

44:01.347 --> 44:03.766
Silence, I kill you. Silence, I kill you.

44:03.849 --> 44:05.100
Silence, I kill you.

44:05.309 --> 44:08.395
Silence, I kill you.

44:08.937 --> 44:10.564
Achmed, why do you always say that?

44:10.648 --> 44:12.441
-What, "silence, I kill you"?
-Yeah.

44:12.524 --> 44:15.402
Because "hush, hush,
or I give you a noogie" wouldn't cut it.

44:15.486 --> 44:17.112
[audience laughing]

44:17.196 --> 44:18.614
How's everything else going?

44:18.697 --> 44:22.451
Well, I am angry, because
Facebook won't let me on Facebook.

44:23.661 --> 44:26.914
-Because you're a terrorist.
-No. Because I don't have a face.

44:26.997 --> 44:28.415
[audience laughing]

44:33.337 --> 44:35.798
-Maybe I need more water.
-Maybe.

44:41.303 --> 44:43.472
-Anything else bothering you?
-I don't know.

44:43.555 --> 44:46.433
My 72 virgins are driving me crazy.

44:47.559 --> 44:48.894
-Why?
-Why?

44:48.977 --> 44:53.440
Do you know what happens when 72 women
all live in the same place together?

44:53.982 --> 44:56.735
We suicide bombers
are actually killing ourselves

44:56.819 --> 44:58.821
just to get away from the angry virgins.

45:00.239 --> 45:02.449
So, this has been a while
that you've had them.

45:02.533 --> 45:04.535
Is it still 72 virgins?

45:05.536 --> 45:06.453
[groans]

45:07.955 --> 45:09.081
I'm working on it.

45:10.624 --> 45:11.792
I'm exhausted.

45:12.543 --> 45:13.877
I just wanna play golf.

45:15.379 --> 45:18.382
-Oh, you play golf?
-I wish. I don't have the equipment.

45:18.465 --> 45:19.800
[audience laughing]

45:20.300 --> 45:22.136
-No clubs?
-No putter.

45:23.762 --> 45:24.847
No balls.

45:26.640 --> 45:28.225
Not even a bag.

45:28.308 --> 45:29.309
[audience laughing]

45:33.313 --> 45:34.690
[audience cheering]

45:38.610 --> 45:40.529
-What are they laughing at?
-Never mind.

45:40.988 --> 45:44.116
And all of those women,
I am not getting any younger.

45:44.199 --> 45:46.201
I'm like the tired popcorn guy.

45:46.577 --> 45:48.871
-What?
-"Come on, get it while it's hot."

45:51.123 --> 45:54.251
Do you at least enjoy
being with the 72 virgins?

45:54.334 --> 45:56.879
Yes, but I can never remember
all their names.

45:57.463 --> 46:00.299
If you don't, how do you call out
to one of them individually?

46:00.382 --> 46:02.342
Hey, you, in the burka.

46:02.801 --> 46:04.178
[audience laughing]

46:04.803 --> 46:06.805
Then they all turn around
at the same time.

46:07.347 --> 46:09.600
It's like prairie dogs with hats.

46:10.642 --> 46:14.605
If I had a hammer, I could play
the world's largest game of whack-a-mole.

46:14.688 --> 46:15.981
[audience laughing]

46:21.820 --> 46:22.905
Whack-a-virgin.

46:24.656 --> 46:26.533
Hey, wasn't that a Madonna song?

46:30.746 --> 46:33.499
I understand your first wife was with you
in the beginning.

46:33.582 --> 46:35.584
And at the end. [mimics explosion]

46:37.503 --> 46:40.297
-So, what first attracted you to her?
-Her goatee.

46:42.341 --> 46:43.967
She had that much facial hair?

46:44.051 --> 46:46.762
No, no. She had a little animal that went:
[bleating]

46:48.347 --> 46:50.807
-I see.
-No, no, you don't wanna see.

46:50.891 --> 46:54.019
-How's that?
-My first wife was not a pretty woman.

46:54.102 --> 46:55.354
-No?
-No. At the mall,

46:55.437 --> 46:58.023
Santa Claus looked at her and went,
"Ho-ho-holy shit."

46:58.106 --> 46:59.816
[audience laughing]

46:59.900 --> 47:02.444
-But your first wife--
-I didn't care about her looks,

47:02.528 --> 47:06.448
because on our first date,
I got pretty far with her.

47:09.576 --> 47:13.205
-You mean you, like, kissed her?
-Oh, a lot more than that.

47:14.164 --> 47:17.751
-Really?
-Yeah. I got to look at her ankle.

47:17.834 --> 47:19.670
[audience laughing]

47:27.803 --> 47:29.972
-Her ankle?
-Oh, yeah. Just thinking about it...

47:30.055 --> 47:31.515
[moaning]

47:32.849 --> 47:35.185
...gives me a big nothing.

47:36.603 --> 47:37.479
-Really?
-Yeah.

47:37.563 --> 47:39.648
-Maybe I need more water.
-Maybe.

47:40.190 --> 47:43.819
You know, I think comedy
and suicide bombing have a lot in common.

47:43.902 --> 47:45.070
-How's that?
-Timing.

47:45.153 --> 47:46.154
[audience laughing]

47:47.155 --> 47:49.533
Think about it. I kill you.
[mimics explosion] Perfect.

47:50.242 --> 47:51.785
I ki-- [mimics explosion] He fucked up.

47:53.620 --> 47:56.206
So, was your wife one of the 72 virgins?

47:56.290 --> 47:59.668
No, no, no. She was long before them.
And then she divorced me.

47:59.751 --> 48:01.962
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay. I got the goat.

48:03.255 --> 48:06.258
-How have things been going lately?
-Oh, not [bleating] bad.

48:06.341 --> 48:07.593
[audience laughing]

48:07.676 --> 48:09.553
Oh, that gets the laugh.

48:10.929 --> 48:14.725
I'm actually dating someone
who is not one of the annoying 72.

48:14.808 --> 48:17.561
-Really?
-Oh, yeah. She is also a suicide bomber.

48:17.644 --> 48:19.771
-You have a lot in common.
-Yeah, she's dead.

48:20.981 --> 48:23.775
And when I say I wanna jump her bones,
that's all she's got.

48:25.110 --> 48:28.447
Yeah, us having sex
sounds like a horse on cobblestones.

48:31.366 --> 48:32.659
[audience applauding]

48:35.287 --> 48:37.956
When I give her a back rub,
it sounds like a xylophone.

48:38.040 --> 48:40.334
[mimicking xylophone]

48:41.001 --> 48:45.005
So, if you get 72 virgins,
what does a female suicide bomber get?

48:45.422 --> 48:46.256
Crock-Pot.

48:47.883 --> 48:49.593
-Non-stick.
-That's great.

48:49.968 --> 48:52.554
But she is a very interesting woman.

48:52.638 --> 48:55.641
She claims she has edible underwear.

48:57.768 --> 48:59.478
Oh, you have heard of this.

49:00.604 --> 49:04.232
Yes, but what flavor edible underwear
would a female terrorist have?

49:04.316 --> 49:05.359
Cherry Bomb.

49:05.442 --> 49:06.860
[audience laughing]

49:14.534 --> 49:17.079
-You get it? It's like two jokes.
-Yeah.

49:17.162 --> 49:19.498
Hey, speaking of that, how are your twins?

49:20.457 --> 49:21.667
[audience laughing]

49:22.459 --> 49:24.836
-Oh, shit. They turned on me.
-Yeah, they did.

49:25.545 --> 49:26.922
The boys are fine, thank you.

49:27.005 --> 49:30.217
But your wife getting pregnant,
that must have been surprising.

49:30.300 --> 49:31.218
-Surprising?
-Yeah.

49:31.301 --> 49:35.097
You know, like finding out a landmine
still works even though it's really old.

49:37.182 --> 49:39.559
Chica, chica, womp, womp.
[mimics explosion]

49:41.269 --> 49:43.939
The two new little Dunham terrorists.

49:44.439 --> 49:46.983
-They're not terrorists.
-Just wait.

49:47.901 --> 49:50.487
-All kids are terrorists.
-No, they're not.

49:50.570 --> 49:52.864
Hey, when you're holding
one of your little boys,

49:52.948 --> 49:55.742
you never know, any second
he might go off. Boom. Stink bomb.

49:57.202 --> 49:59.663
-What are their names?
-Jack and James.

49:59.746 --> 50:01.790
[laughing]

50:01.873 --> 50:04.626
You are so fucking white. Oh, my God.

50:04.710 --> 50:06.044
[audience laughing]

50:06.670 --> 50:08.463
Jack and James?

50:08.547 --> 50:09.923
[audience applauding]

50:13.844 --> 50:17.055
Sounds like a nursery rhyme
for two gay kids.

50:18.181 --> 50:22.477
[singing]  Jack and James went out the door
To fetch a pail of lattes

50:24.688 --> 50:25.981
What are your kids' names?

50:26.064 --> 50:28.191
Achmed Junior,
Achmed Junior Junior Junior,

50:28.275 --> 50:30.318
Achmed Junior, JR and Steve.

50:32.362 --> 50:34.531
-Steve?
-One of the virgins is white.

50:36.783 --> 50:39.453
One of my boys is getting ready
to go through puberty.

50:39.536 --> 50:41.496
-That is a tough age.
-Yup.

50:41.580 --> 50:42.414
They never listen.

50:42.497 --> 50:45.959
-You have to repeat things over and over.
-Like what?

50:46.042 --> 50:49.087
The same things my father
used to say to me all the time.

50:49.171 --> 50:51.548
-What's that?
-"Stop pulling on your dynamite.

50:56.553 --> 50:57.721
It's gonna go off.

50:59.848 --> 51:01.224
And then you'll be blind."

51:01.308 --> 51:02.392
[audience laughing]

51:03.059 --> 51:04.519
[audience applauding]

51:09.399 --> 51:11.109
Achmed, when my girls were young,

51:11.193 --> 51:13.361
one of their favorite games
was "got your nose."

51:13.445 --> 51:15.030
You ever play...?

51:15.113 --> 51:16.156
[audience laughing]

51:17.407 --> 51:20.327
I am seriously going to kill you
after this show.

51:21.495 --> 51:23.413
So, Achmed, what were your parents like?

51:23.747 --> 51:27.667
Well, after my father went to work,
I didn't see much of him.

51:28.168 --> 51:29.419
[audience laughing]

51:34.299 --> 51:35.133
Where'd he go?

51:35.217 --> 51:37.844
Over there, over there, up there,
down there, over there.

51:39.095 --> 51:39.971
That's...

51:40.514 --> 51:41.807
[audience applauding]

51:44.601 --> 51:45.435
That's terrible.

51:45.519 --> 51:47.854
Yeah. So, now,
whenever there's a sandstorm,

51:47.938 --> 51:49.356
I'm like, "Dad."

51:49.439 --> 51:50.941
[audience laughing]

51:51.691 --> 51:54.986
Achmed, there's been a curiosity
about you in the past ten years.

51:55.070 --> 51:58.532
I get questions about you all the time.
Are you gonna tell your life story?

51:58.615 --> 51:59.866
-Like in a book?
-Yeah.

51:59.950 --> 52:02.077
Oh, that'd be great. Once upon a time...

52:02.160 --> 52:03.245
[mimics explosion] The end.

52:04.746 --> 52:06.081
If you could go back in time,

52:06.164 --> 52:08.708
is there anything you'd do differently
or change?

52:08.792 --> 52:10.210
I'd cut the other wire.

52:10.293 --> 52:11.837
[audience laughing]

52:11.920 --> 52:13.171
It's not funny!

52:14.548 --> 52:16.383
Well, did any good come of your death?

52:16.466 --> 52:20.929
Well, it was near a hospital,
so technically, I'm an organ donor.

52:21.012 --> 52:22.389
[audience laughing]

52:26.268 --> 52:29.938
Yeah, for the hospital staff,
it was like a gross Easter egg hunt.

52:31.398 --> 52:36.278
But now with no skin,
I can't get the tattoo I always wanted.

52:36.361 --> 52:38.864
-What tattoo was that?
-Skull and crossbones.

52:38.947 --> 52:39.990
[audience laughing]

52:40.073 --> 52:41.032
Not funny!

52:42.117 --> 52:43.577
Or maybe a face!

52:44.661 --> 52:46.329
-Covered with water!
-Maybe.

52:47.455 --> 52:50.542
Damn it. Remind me
not to blow myself up anymore.

52:51.251 --> 52:53.003
Well, things could be worse.

52:53.211 --> 52:54.337
How could they be worse?

52:54.421 --> 52:57.340
Well, I could've found out my mother
was a whore

52:57.424 --> 52:59.217
and my real father is Walter.

52:59.301 --> 53:01.303
[audience laughing]

53:04.598 --> 53:05.682
[laughing]

53:09.269 --> 53:11.563
Sucks for you!

53:12.105 --> 53:15.358
Achmed, one of the biggest topics now
that everyone is worried about

53:15.442 --> 53:18.278
is that scary group
who wants to take over the world.

53:18.361 --> 53:20.113
Yeah, the Kardashians.

53:20.196 --> 53:21.406
[audience laughing]

53:26.578 --> 53:27.454
No.

53:31.833 --> 53:34.836
-No, ISIS.
-Oh, those guys.

53:35.170 --> 53:38.506
-Were you ever in ISIS?
-No, I was in a smaller fringe group.

53:38.590 --> 53:41.384
We just blew up things.
We called ourselves the Tali-bam!

53:42.969 --> 53:45.013
But I love the Kardashians.

53:45.096 --> 53:46.598
-You do?
-Oh, sure.

53:46.681 --> 53:48.558
That is one scary-ass family.

53:49.643 --> 53:51.269
I cannot stop watching their show.

53:51.853 --> 53:53.688
Really? Who's your favorite Kardashian?

53:54.230 --> 53:55.106
The black one.

53:56.858 --> 53:58.360
No, that's Kanye. He's West.

53:58.902 --> 54:00.654
I'm pretty sure he's south.

54:02.155 --> 54:03.698
-Not the direction.
-No direction?

54:03.782 --> 54:05.492
-Not that direction.
-Which direction?

54:05.784 --> 54:06.660
None.

54:07.160 --> 54:08.912
-None?
-Well, one direction.

54:08.995 --> 54:10.205
He's in a boy band?

54:10.288 --> 54:11.581
[audience laughing]

54:11.665 --> 54:13.041
No, I said he's West.

54:13.124 --> 54:15.210
Well, I guess. He's certainly not north.

54:15.293 --> 54:16.670
-No, that's his daughter.
-No.

54:23.718 --> 54:25.512
[audience cheering]

54:29.224 --> 54:31.142
His daughter is up north?

54:31.226 --> 54:32.519
No, his daughter is North.

54:32.602 --> 54:33.937
That's what I said.

54:34.020 --> 54:35.605
His daughter is North West.

54:38.650 --> 54:39.526
He's quick.

54:41.361 --> 54:43.154
-No.
-Is he still west?

54:43.238 --> 54:44.197
-No.
-Now no?

54:44.280 --> 54:45.407
No, he's a West.

54:45.991 --> 54:46.992
What are you, Italian?

54:47.867 --> 54:50.370
[in Italian accent] "I don't a-care
if he's a-north or a-south."

54:51.413 --> 54:53.415
No, he's West, but he's not out west.

54:53.498 --> 54:55.500
His daughter is North,
but she's also West.

54:55.583 --> 54:57.919
So, she's North West,
and the whole family is West.

55:01.631 --> 55:05.176
[in normal voice] You've finally started
experimenting with crack, haven't you?

55:05.260 --> 55:06.761
[audience laughing]

55:07.012 --> 55:09.431
-But Kim is Kanye's wife.
-Yes.

55:09.514 --> 55:11.349
-And where is she?
-I don't know.

55:11.933 --> 55:13.560
But you know everyone else is west.

55:15.145 --> 55:16.563
-She is, too.
-A-ha!

55:17.355 --> 55:18.231
Wait.

55:18.314 --> 55:19.399
[laughing]

55:20.150 --> 55:22.402
-Do you know who Kim's stepfather is?
-No.

55:22.485 --> 55:23.778
She's a lovely woman.

55:24.154 --> 55:25.405
[audience laughing]

55:25.989 --> 55:27.490
Stop screwing with me!

55:28.283 --> 55:29.492
I kill you from here!

55:31.953 --> 55:33.079
Not funny!

55:35.373 --> 55:37.625
And you're making it worse,
because I'm hangry.

55:37.834 --> 55:40.462
-You mean hungry?
-No, hangry. I'm hungry and angry.

55:41.755 --> 55:43.131
You're looking a little thin.

55:44.340 --> 55:45.216
Silence!

55:46.468 --> 55:48.636
-Did you eat today? Oh.
-Just breakfast.

55:48.720 --> 55:50.889
-Cereal.
-What's your favorite breakfast cereal?

55:51.473 --> 55:52.307
Life.

55:52.390 --> 55:53.850
[audience laughing]

55:53.933 --> 55:57.353
And then I usually add a few grape nuts
just so I can say I have some.

55:57.437 --> 55:58.938
[audience laughing]

55:59.022 --> 55:59.939
Not funny!

56:01.107 --> 56:03.485
-You like any ethnic foods?
-Mexican.

56:03.568 --> 56:05.403
-Oh, I love Mexican food, too.
-Yeah.

56:05.487 --> 56:08.698
So, if you like Mexican,
do you like soft or crunchy tacos?

56:10.158 --> 56:11.659
[audience laughing]

56:15.080 --> 56:19.375
Uh, in this instance,
are you using taco as a metaphor?

56:19.459 --> 56:20.627
[audience laughing]

56:21.628 --> 56:24.839
Because your answer
will determine my answer.

56:27.008 --> 56:28.259
-No.
-Crunchy.

56:28.343 --> 56:29.177
Okay.

56:30.136 --> 56:31.763
-Yes.
-Soft.

56:33.932 --> 56:37.852
I bet there's some school dropouts here
that are very confused.

56:38.728 --> 56:41.481
"I thought a metaphor
was a new kind of Mercedes."

56:41.564 --> 56:42.565
[groans]

56:43.483 --> 56:46.903
"The Mercedes Metaphor class.
It's like something else."

56:50.406 --> 56:51.533
[laughing]

56:54.577 --> 56:58.164
You know, in all honesty, sometimes
in these places, I don't feel safe.

56:58.248 --> 56:59.666
-A little outnumbered?
-Yeah.

56:59.749 --> 57:00.583
I understand.

57:00.667 --> 57:03.002
I should have some sort of signal
if I need help.

57:03.586 --> 57:07.048
Well, I saw in a movie once
where they told a guy to blink really fast

57:07.132 --> 57:08.299
if he felt in danger.

57:08.383 --> 57:10.343
Oh, okay. [panting]

[audience laughing]

57:18.351 --> 57:20.061
Son of a bitch!

57:21.479 --> 57:25.650
Bubba J's arms are too short
and I don't have any fucking eyelids!

57:26.151 --> 57:27.735
Maybe I need more water!

57:27.944 --> 57:29.529
Maybe. Say good night, Achmed.

57:29.612 --> 57:31.531
Thank you, Dublin!

57:31.614 --> 57:33.199
[audience cheering]

57:36.244 --> 57:37.412
I kill you!

57:42.542 --> 57:44.335
And now for our last guy this evening.

57:44.419 --> 57:46.129
He's purple, he's wacky.

57:46.212 --> 57:47.922
Please help me welcome my buddy, Peanut.

57:48.006 --> 57:49.424
[audience cheering]

57:55.597 --> 57:57.432
-How are you, Peanut?
-Good. How are you?

57:57.515 --> 57:59.934
-I'm fine.
-That's good. That's good.

58:00.018 --> 58:01.060
[laughing]

58:01.144 --> 58:05.398
Two infants at your age,
how the hell did that happen?

58:05.482 --> 58:07.192
[howls]

58:07.734 --> 58:10.570
Didn't anyone ever tell you
about the birds and the bees?

58:10.653 --> 58:13.615
Yup, but nobody mentioned
the birds and the dinosaurs.

58:13.698 --> 58:14.741
[laughing]

58:15.450 --> 58:17.619
I wonder what their first words
are gonna be.

58:17.702 --> 58:19.996
-Mama? Dada?
-More like, "Grandpa."

58:20.079 --> 58:21.122
[laughing]

58:22.081 --> 58:24.459
Don't worry, you'll probably be deaf
by then anyway.

58:25.335 --> 58:26.169
Grandpa.

58:27.253 --> 58:29.756
Hey, you can all share
the same mushed baby food.

58:30.548 --> 58:32.217
-Or eat your shit.
-Stop it.

58:33.343 --> 58:35.595
-Is it hard to tell the twins apart?
-Not at all.

58:35.678 --> 58:38.181
But soon, it'll be hard for you
to tell anything apart.

58:38.264 --> 58:41.726
"No, Dad, that's a toilet plunger.
That is not a dog dish on a stick."

58:42.810 --> 58:44.229
At your age, playing catch

58:44.312 --> 58:47.106
means trying to stop Daddy
from falling down the stairs.

58:47.774 --> 58:49.734
-You got no balance.
-Stop it.

58:50.235 --> 58:52.195
I got to watch them
take their first steps.

58:52.278 --> 58:54.697
Yeah, they get to watch you
take your last.

58:54.781 --> 58:55.823
[audience laughing]

59:04.290 --> 59:06.626
The great thing for them
is when they misbehave,

59:06.709 --> 59:08.711
you won't remember what they did wrong.

59:08.795 --> 59:12.799
"If I told you once,
I told you a thousand times some shit."

59:12.882 --> 59:15.218
-[laughing] You're senile.
-Stop it.

59:15.927 --> 59:18.263
I can't wait to take them
to their first game.

59:18.346 --> 59:19.889
What, bingo? [laughing]

59:21.224 --> 59:22.892
-'Cause you're in a home.
-Stop it.

59:23.768 --> 59:26.271
Will they be riding on the
back of your motorcycle? No.

59:26.354 --> 59:28.648
The back of your electric scooter. Yay!

59:29.232 --> 59:32.110
"Come on, Dad, let's run over
the extension cord again." Yay!

59:32.193 --> 59:33.778
Thump, thump, yay!

59:33.861 --> 59:37.115
You don't have to take them to Disneyland.
You can just put them on your chairlift.

59:37.198 --> 59:39.450
[buzzing]

59:39.534 --> 59:41.411
-You can't use the stairs.
-Stop it.

59:41.494 --> 59:42.537
[laughing]

59:42.912 --> 59:43.871
Stop it.

59:43.955 --> 59:44.998
Play hide-and-seek?

59:45.081 --> 59:49.127
No, because you'll forget
what the fuck you're looking for.

59:49.210 --> 59:50.587
[audience laughing]

59:51.379 --> 59:53.464
[audience cheering]

59:54.048 --> 59:55.091
[laughing]

59:58.803 --> 01:00:02.098
You'll be so old by the time your sons
are ready to hear the sex talk,

01:00:02.181 --> 01:00:03.391
you'll be saying to them:

01:00:03.474 --> 01:00:05.768
"When a man and a woman
love each other very much,

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:07.353
the man takes a blue pill.

01:00:09.314 --> 01:00:11.024
Waits for it to kick in,

01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:13.484
then lowers the railings
on his hospital bed.

01:00:14.819 --> 01:00:17.363
Throws his legs over this side
and breaks his hip."

01:00:18.364 --> 01:00:20.700
Wow, breaking your hip
right after taking a Viagra.

01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:24.454
"Well, before we put a cast on that, sir,
we're gonna have to wait four hours."

01:00:25.246 --> 01:00:26.748
-You got a boner.
-Stop it.

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:29.917
Just do not ever give them that talk.

01:00:30.001 --> 01:00:32.420
No one wants to hear the sex talk
from their grandpa.

01:00:32.795 --> 01:00:34.088
I'm not their grandpa.

01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:36.966
Hey, if it looks like a duck
and it walks like a duck...

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:39.052
-You're a fucking duck.
-Stop it.

01:00:40.136 --> 01:00:41.971
-Might fucking quack.
-Stop it.

01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:42.972
[laughing]

01:00:43.598 --> 01:00:44.557
Stop it!

01:00:45.433 --> 01:00:46.684
I feel sorry for your boys,

01:00:46.768 --> 01:00:48.978
'cause when they're old enough
to go to school,

01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:51.689
other boys will be saying,
"My dad can beat up your dad."

01:00:51.773 --> 01:00:54.275
They'll be saying, "We can beat up
our own fucking dad.

01:00:55.276 --> 01:00:57.779
Just have to knock him
out of his wheelchair first."

01:00:58.988 --> 01:01:00.490
Then you'll be laying
on the ground yelling:

01:01:00.573 --> 01:01:04.035
"Help! My 5-year-old sons
kicked my ass and I can't get up!"

01:01:04.118 --> 01:01:05.787
-'Cause you're weak.
-Stop it.

01:01:06.537 --> 01:01:08.456
-You're gonna get them a dog?
-Eventually.

01:01:08.539 --> 01:01:09.582
No, get them a dog now.

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:12.168
Get them the Shar-Pei,
one of those full-defurred dogs.

01:01:12.251 --> 01:01:13.252
Why that kind of dog?

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:14.504
Well, when they're teens,

01:01:14.587 --> 01:01:17.215
everybody will be used to having
some blind wrinkly thing

01:01:17.298 --> 01:01:19.384
wandering around the house
bumping into walls.

01:01:19.926 --> 01:01:21.302
-You.
-Stop it.

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:23.429
-But they're healthy?
-Yes.

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:25.515
-Good, 20 fingers and 20 toes?
-Yes.

01:01:25.598 --> 01:01:28.101
-Two bats and four balls?
-[chuckles] Yes.

01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:31.312
-You'll bring them on the tour bus?
-Probably.

01:01:31.396 --> 01:01:33.564
Be like us and make them sleep
in the suitcase?

01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:35.608
-'Cause you're an asshole.
-Stop it.

01:01:36.651 --> 01:01:38.820
Just make sure you teach them
how to tell time.

01:01:38.903 --> 01:01:39.987
I will. But why?

01:01:40.071 --> 01:01:42.490
So, they'll know when to give you
your medication.

01:01:42.573 --> 01:01:44.075
[audience laughing]

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:45.660
-Are they talking yet?
-Not yet.

01:01:45.743 --> 01:01:47.829
But we're starting
to watch everything we say,

01:01:47.912 --> 01:01:50.289
'cause eventually,
they repeat everything they hear.

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:52.667
What are they gonna get in trouble
for saying?

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:54.210
Prune juice.

01:01:55.503 --> 01:01:57.755
Osteoporosis.

01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:00.425
-Funeral arrangements.
-Stop it.

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:03.761
Have you kid-proofed the house yet?

01:02:03.845 --> 01:02:06.389
-Everything but a couple of antiques.
-What, you and your mom?

01:02:06.472 --> 01:02:07.765
[laughing]

01:02:07.932 --> 01:02:09.767
-'Cause you're both old farts.
-Stop it.

01:02:11.144 --> 01:02:14.105
Think of how old you'll be
when you teach them to drive.

01:02:14.188 --> 01:02:15.898
-It'll be fine.
-No, it won't.

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:19.485
They'll learn to drive
if their indicator is always on.

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:23.823
When they graduate from high school,
you gonna give them wheels?

01:02:23.906 --> 01:02:26.075
-Probably.
-What, the ones off your walker? [laughs]

01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:29.120
-And two fucking tennis balls.
-Stop it.

01:02:29.787 --> 01:02:33.166
So, with the kids in the house, is
the chica, womp, womp, kind of affected?

01:02:33.249 --> 01:02:36.419
-A little bit.
-Yeah, now it's: chica, womp, womp, womp.

01:02:37.044 --> 01:02:39.881
You used to have on music
like Sade and Luther Vandross.

01:02:39.964 --> 01:02:43.134
Now you do it to the sounds
of the baby monitor.

01:02:43.217 --> 01:02:45.386
Chica, chica, womp, womp, [crackling]

01:02:46.721 --> 01:02:50.016
You light candles, but now it's
to get rid of the smell of the diapers.

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:51.350
-Yeah.
-Not just the boys'.

01:02:55.396 --> 01:02:57.982
What are your wife's signals
when she's ready for love?

01:02:58.065 --> 01:03:00.902
Does she coyly
wipe the spit off her shoulders?

01:03:01.486 --> 01:03:02.653
"Hey, Daddy.

01:03:03.863 --> 01:03:06.365
I can change your diaper.

01:03:07.658 --> 01:03:09.202
Want something to drink?"

01:03:12.246 --> 01:03:15.041
Oh, like you have never thought of that.

01:03:15.833 --> 01:03:18.461
Are you gonna be one of those
really cautious dads?

01:03:18.544 --> 01:03:21.214
-What does that mean?
-Kids wearing knee pads and helmets.

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:22.673
-Probably.
-I mean, you should.

01:03:22.757 --> 01:03:24.717
You didn't have that when you were little.

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:26.052
-No.
-Probably affected you.

01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:26.969
No.

01:03:51.369 --> 01:03:54.247
I know. It's hard for you to accept,
isn't it?

01:03:56.415 --> 01:03:58.209
You should've worn the fucking helmet.

What are you--? What are you doing?

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:13.891
Being annoying.

01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:16.894
This is awkward.

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:19.480
I know.

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:22.608
I don't like this.

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:24.777
Exactly.

Put it back!

-Give me it back!
-You know how this works, right?

01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:16.829
-What?
-You have a hole in your head.

01:05:19.165 --> 01:05:20.082
Is this gonna hurt?

01:05:23.711 --> 01:05:25.880
-I just asked you if this is gonna hurt.
-Yeah.

I bet no one
has ever asked you that before.

â™ª There is no choice, no compromise
Give up one of your kin â™ª

To save your bone and skin â™ª

Turn their faces to the sun â™ª

01:08:23.432 --> 01:08:25.309
â™ª To a place where law
And love were taught â™ª

01:08:25.392 --> 01:08:27.144
â™ª And peace, it overflowed â™ª

01:08:27.228 --> 01:08:30.898
â™ª One night a soulless father
Met the stranger on the road â™ª

01:08:30.981 --> 01:08:34.652
â™ª I'll fight until one of us dies
He screamed into his face â™ª

01:08:34.734 --> 01:08:38.279
â™ª "I admire your noble notion"
Said the stranger, touched by grace â™ª

01:08:38.363 --> 01:08:41.992
â™ª But first please let me show you
Where the young you gave me play â™ª

01:08:42.076 --> 01:08:46.330
â™ª In meadows filled with laughter
Growing wiser by the day â™ª

01:09:00.761 --> 01:09:04.849
â™ª One day your son may save you all
From the hell of Soldierstown â™ª

01:09:04.932 --> 01:09:08.560
â™ª "But take him back," the stranger cried
His patience wearing down â™ª

01:09:08.644 --> 01:09:12.481
â™ª A stranger came to Soldierstown
When 20 years had passed â™ª

01:09:12.564 --> 01:09:17.444
â™ª Looking for his father
Breathing slowly on the glass â™ª

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:31.417
â™ª There is no choice, no compromise
Give up one of your kin â™ª

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:35.129
â™ª To save the other children
To save your bone and skin â™ª

01:09:35.212 --> 01:09:38.631
â™ªTonight's the night, you must decide
Which son will stay or go â™ª

01:09:38.716 --> 01:09:42.678
â™ª The devil rides in Soldierstown
His boots cut through the snow â™ª

01:09:42.761 --> 01:09:46.223
â™ª You can hear the screams in Belfast town
Or so the story goes â™ª

01:09:46.307 --> 01:09:50.019
â™ª You can trace the sets of footprints
In the deepest winter snows â™ª

01:09:50.102 --> 01:09:53.439
â™ª There's nothing here in Soldierstown
Save misery and pain â™ª

01:09:53.814 --> 01:09:58.235
â™ª The devil rides in Soldierstown
He's smiling once again â™ª

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:16.420
â™ª The devil rides in Soldierstown â™ª

01:10:17.305 --> 01:10:23.280
