00:17.600 --> 00:20.100
* Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah *

00:20.100 --> 00:21.667
Looks like my secret
breakfast spot

00:21.667 --> 00:23.067
isn't so secret
anymore.

00:23.067 --> 00:25.467
- Oh, my God. Hi.
- Hi.

00:25.467 --> 00:27.733
Yeah, I would've never
even known about this place,

00:27.733 --> 00:29.233
except I got off
at the wrong stop

00:29.233 --> 00:31.600
one day on my way
to work and...

00:31.600 --> 00:33.667
Tolstoy before
9:00 a.m.

00:33.667 --> 00:35.533
Hasn't anyone told you
about the New York Post?

00:35.533 --> 00:36.733
Yeah, uh--
(scoffs)

00:36.733 --> 00:38.933
Nah, I skip
all the boring parts

00:38.933 --> 00:40.200
about collective
farming

00:40.200 --> 00:41.433
and go straight
to the soap opera

00:41.433 --> 00:43.100
of Anna having
the affair.

00:43.100 --> 00:45.500
It's like Real Housewives
of St. Petersburg...

00:45.500 --> 00:48.633
with dense
Russian prose.

00:48.633 --> 00:50.133
You know, you should
take a crack

00:50.133 --> 00:51.467
at the slush pile
sometime.

00:51.467 --> 00:52.733
The slush pile?

00:52.733 --> 00:55.600
Not Tolstoy,
but you never know.

00:55.600 --> 01:00.200
And if you tell anyone
about the French toast here,

01:00.200 --> 01:01.433
I'm gonna have
to kill you.

01:01.433 --> 01:02.700
Don't worry.
I'm--

01:02.700 --> 01:04.800
I'm really good
at keeping a secret.

01:15.767 --> 01:17.167
Hey.

01:17.167 --> 01:18.367
Morning.

01:18.367 --> 01:20.067
Where's the slush pile?

01:20.067 --> 01:23.733
Uh, it's that sad, little
stack of books behind me.

01:23.733 --> 01:26.800
That's
the slush pile.

01:29.367 --> 01:31.067
[snorts]

01:31.067 --> 01:32.267
Wow, this is
all in caps.

01:32.267 --> 01:33.533
"Girl, do you want
to get paid

01:33.533 --> 01:36.167
like a basic bitch
or a billionaire bitch?"

01:36.167 --> 01:38.433
Oh, my God.
This is awful.

01:38.433 --> 01:39.700
They all are.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.467
Every one is worse
than the last.

01:41.467 --> 01:43.967
All you have to do
is read the first line.

01:43.967 --> 01:46.067
[giggles]

01:46.067 --> 01:48.467
"It turned out Larry's
spirit animal was...

01:48.467 --> 01:49.733
the hedgehog."

01:49.733 --> 01:50.933
[laughs]

01:50.933 --> 01:52.400
"As time went by,
I came to realize

01:52.400 --> 01:54.700
Trevor was definitely
incontinent."

01:54.700 --> 01:55.900
Oh.

01:55.900 --> 01:57.100
(both)
Ew.

01:57.100 --> 01:58.300
[both laughing]

01:58.300 --> 01:59.667
Okay,
and for the win,

01:59.667 --> 02:01.333
by Meredith Montgomery,

02:01.333 --> 02:03.067
The Scarf.

02:05.133 --> 02:06.467
"The severity
often differs,

02:06.467 --> 02:08.433
"even the location
of the wound.

02:08.433 --> 02:09.900
"But what's never changed
is the fact

02:09.900 --> 02:11.467
"that he was
a Confederate soldier

02:11.467 --> 02:12.867
"and my grandfather.

02:12.867 --> 02:16.267
The boy who saved his life
was a Union bugler."

02:16.267 --> 02:18.067
[laughs]

02:18.067 --> 02:19.367
Bugler.

02:19.367 --> 02:20.567
No, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

02:20.567 --> 02:21.767
This one
isn't that bad.

02:21.767 --> 02:24.300
"He was 12, and he made
a tourniquet

02:24.300 --> 02:27.500
"out of his scarf.

"The Confederate
soldier survived,

five years later,

02:31.400 --> 02:33.100
"he tracked down
the little bugler

02:33.100 --> 02:34.933
and gave it back."

02:34.933 --> 02:36.100
Aw, that's sweet.

02:36.100 --> 02:38.333
Liza, it's not
gonna hold up.

02:38.333 --> 02:39.633
You have
a better chance

02:39.633 --> 02:41.733
at matching with
Ryan Gosling on Tinder

02:41.733 --> 02:45.633
than finding a good book
in the slush pile.

03:07.567 --> 03:09.133
[horn honks]

03:17.500 --> 03:18.833
The Scarf?

03:18.833 --> 03:20.400
Yeah, okay, I know
the title is lame,

03:20.400 --> 03:21.933
but it's really good.

03:21.933 --> 03:25.200
It's about how this
12-year-old Union soldier

03:25.200 --> 03:28.833
uses his scarf to save
a Confederate soldier's life

03:28.833 --> 03:31.067
and how that
act of humanity

03:31.067 --> 03:33.367
shapes the identity
of the Union soldier's family

03:33.367 --> 03:34.767
for generations.

03:34.767 --> 03:35.967
Wow.

03:35.967 --> 03:37.233
It's good.
You should read it.

03:37.233 --> 03:39.300
Oh, no, I'm not really
that big of a reader.

03:39.300 --> 03:41.533
I mean, I read Japanese manga
every once in a while,

03:41.533 --> 03:43.767
but mainly for the art,
you know?

03:43.767 --> 03:45.867
Oh, I didn't
know that.

03:45.867 --> 03:49.600
I mean, maybe you can
read it to me in bed

03:49.600 --> 03:52.533
after we play dodgeball.

03:52.533 --> 03:55.967
[people chattering]

03:55.967 --> 03:56.967
Bam!

03:56.967 --> 03:58.767
The Billburg
Ball Slingers?

03:58.767 --> 04:00.200
Yeah, and I designed
the logo myself.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.967
- It's dope, right?
- Totally.

04:01.967 --> 04:04.700
Hey, what up, Donny?
D-cup!

04:04.700 --> 04:06.167
Legend, that one.

04:06.167 --> 04:09.067
Oh, he's on the team?
Okay. Okay.

04:09.067 --> 04:10.600
Then I have nothing
to worry about.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.667
Just watch out
for her,

04:12.667 --> 04:15.800
her, and those two
right there.

04:15.800 --> 04:19.132
Yeah, it got super crazy
one night after finals.

04:19.132 --> 04:20.267
You ready?

04:20.267 --> 04:22.733
No, I don't even
know the rules.

04:22.733 --> 04:24.967
Shh.
Just don't get hit.

[upbeat funky music]

04:50.867 --> 04:52.100

Over there.

* Shake it, shake it

04:56.567 --> 04:58.133

Head down.

04:58.133 --> 04:59.367
You're out!

04:59.367 --> 05:01.533

*

05:15.733 --> 05:17.067
You know what,
the problem is,

05:17.067 --> 05:18.400
is you never found
your rhythm.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.600
I don't think there was
just one problem, Josh,

05:20.600 --> 05:22.600
unless it was me
agreeing to play.

05:22.600 --> 05:23.833
I totally thought
you'd love it.

05:23.833 --> 05:25.067
I'm sorry.

05:25.067 --> 05:26.433
Also, you look
like you'd be

05:26.433 --> 05:28.067
a lot faster
than you were.

05:28.067 --> 05:29.200
There was nowhere
to run!

05:29.200 --> 05:30.567
It was like being
trapped in a cage

05:30.567 --> 05:31.900
with rabid hipsters.

05:31.900 --> 05:33.733
If there's such thing
as artisanal steroids,

05:33.733 --> 05:35.133
I'm pretty sure
they were on them.

05:35.133 --> 05:37.200
Whoa, where was this fire
out on the court?

05:37.200 --> 05:40.567
Huh? I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

05:40.567 --> 05:42.867
I'm gonna go get something else
for your eye, all right?

05:42.867 --> 05:45.200
- Or we could just go home.
- [chuckles]

05:47.767 --> 05:50.200
Hey, Josh's new friend.

05:50.200 --> 05:51.233
I'm Jen.

05:51.233 --> 05:52.833
Liza.

05:52.833 --> 05:55.133
Ooh, I think that's my bad.
Sorry.

05:55.133 --> 05:57.300
You're like my old camera.
You tap it, and, bam,

05:57.300 --> 05:58.700
the air bags deploy.

05:58.700 --> 06:02.067
Tap? Yeah, I actually
think you hit me pretty hard.

06:02.067 --> 06:03.567
Eh, maybe.

06:03.567 --> 06:05.767
When I first joined the league,
it almost wrecked me--

06:05.767 --> 06:07.200
busted finger,
chipped tooth,

06:07.200 --> 06:08.833
and what turned out
to be gonorrhea.

06:08.833 --> 06:10.567
Okay, well, it was
really nice talking to you.

06:10.567 --> 06:13.967
Yeah, I'd just gotten out
of a seven-year relationship.

06:13.967 --> 06:15.800
When you're with a guy
for that long

06:15.800 --> 06:17.633
and you finally
have your freedom,

06:17.633 --> 06:19.767
you make
some bad calls.

06:19.767 --> 06:23.400
So anyway, Josh and I
know each other well.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.633
Gonorrhea well?

06:24.633 --> 06:26.233
[laughs]
Nah.

06:26.233 --> 06:27.833
He's clean.

06:27.833 --> 06:30.900
Have fun with him.
He's gorgeous...

06:30.900 --> 06:33.067
but dumb
as a box of hair.

06:36.867 --> 06:40.467
Hey, I got you
some ice.

06:40.467 --> 06:44.300
Whoa, or is it ices?

06:44.300 --> 06:45.667
[laughs]

06:45.667 --> 06:48.500
What's the plural
of ice, bro?

06:48.500 --> 06:50.600
It's a collective noun.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.233
Hey, I brought you
some ice.

06:54.267 --> 06:55.467
You okay?

06:55.467 --> 06:58.233
Oh--uh, no.
It still smarts--

06:58.233 --> 06:59.567
I mean, hurts.

06:59.567 --> 07:01.700
(man)
* Honey,
a heart attack honey *

07:01.700 --> 07:04.067
* Enough is enough

07:13.367 --> 07:16.100
- Hey. Good morning.
- Morning.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.500
[chuckles]

07:17.500 --> 07:21.167
Looks like someone had a little
too much fun last night.

07:21.167 --> 07:22.567
- Not exactly.
- [gasps]

07:22.567 --> 07:24.833
Oh, my God.
What happened to you?

07:24.833 --> 07:26.500
Dodgeball,
that's what happened.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.133
Why are we still
playing kids' sports?

07:28.133 --> 07:29.800
You shouldn't be allowed
to throw a ball

07:29.800 --> 07:31.467
at someone's face
with adult strength.

07:31.467 --> 07:32.767
Come up to my office.

07:32.767 --> 07:34.267
I've got some
pretty heavy-duty stuff

07:34.267 --> 07:36.433
for period acne
and covering tattoos.

07:36.433 --> 07:37.933
It should
do the trick.

07:37.933 --> 07:39.633
I also got nailed
in the vagina.

07:39.633 --> 07:41.067
[groans]

07:41.067 --> 07:42.200
[laughs]

07:45.267 --> 07:47.167
Can I ask you
something?

07:47.167 --> 07:48.167
Yeah.

07:48.167 --> 07:49.433
Do you think
Josh is dumb?

07:49.433 --> 07:51.600
I'm sure he's dumb.
He's a guy.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.500
Josh dropped out
of college.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.800
So did Mark Zuckerberg.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.900
Kelsey, he doesn't read.

07:56.900 --> 07:58.767
Well, if that's
important to you,

07:58.767 --> 08:00.267
then that's important.

08:00.267 --> 08:01.967
I mean, we all have
our deal breakers.

08:01.967 --> 08:04.067
I finished that book.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.600
It totally held up.

08:05.600 --> 08:06.967
No way.

08:06.967 --> 08:09.467
What happened with
the little bugler's scarf?

08:09.467 --> 08:13.200
Well, it--it becomes
this family legend.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.400
The story of the little bugler

08:14.400 --> 08:16.067
gets passed down
through this family,

08:16.067 --> 08:18.900
like long after
the scarf goes missing.

08:18.900 --> 08:21.133
By the end,
you start to think,

08:21.133 --> 08:22.500
"Maybe there never
was a scarf.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.533
"It was just a way
for this family

08:24.533 --> 08:26.067
to form an identity."

08:26.067 --> 08:27.500
Sounds like
a total mom book.

08:27.500 --> 08:28.967
50 Shades of Grey
was a mom book.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.800
Uh, don't remind me.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.832
My mom kept her copy
in her bath caddy.

08:32.832 --> 08:35.267
I'm like, "Mom, I'm glad
you still have a sex drive,

08:35.267 --> 08:36.832
"but I don't need
to see the evidence

08:36.832 --> 08:38.732
next to your loofah."

08:38.732 --> 08:40.067
I really think
The Scarf

08:40.067 --> 08:41.866
has the potential
to be something, Kels.

08:41.866 --> 08:44.567
Well, the only way
that a book like that happens

08:44.567 --> 08:46.067
is on a grassroots level--

08:46.067 --> 08:48.267
blogs,
suburban book clubs--

08:48.267 --> 08:50.433
I thought those book clubs
were only for,

08:50.433 --> 08:52.400
like, you know,
bored housewives.

08:52.400 --> 08:53.967
Those bored housewives,

08:53.967 --> 08:55.267
with their Oprah picks

08:55.267 --> 08:57.767
and their bottomless glasses
of Pinot Grigio,

08:57.767 --> 08:59.200
drive this business.

08:59.200 --> 09:01.367
If you can get
the housewives,

09:01.367 --> 09:03.133
you can make
the best-seller list.

09:06.533 --> 09:07.767
Michelle?

09:07.767 --> 09:09.933
Liza Miller, it is so good
to hear your voice.

09:09.933 --> 09:12.733
Yours too; I've been
thinking about you so much.

09:12.733 --> 09:13.933
Oh, and me you.

09:13.933 --> 09:15.167
Am I ever gonna see you,

09:15.167 --> 09:16.800
or do I have to hope
to run into you again

09:16.800 --> 09:17.933
on a street in Brooklyn?

09:17.933 --> 09:19.400
Actually, I was wondering

09:19.400 --> 09:21.800
if I was still in good standing
as a member of book club

09:21.800 --> 09:24.367
because I have an amazing book
for us to chat about.

09:24.367 --> 09:27.067
(Michelle)
Well, we're supposed to reread
The Handmaid's Tale,

09:27.067 --> 09:29.867
but it's really just an excuse
to make Margarita Atwoods,

09:29.867 --> 09:31.100
so, yes, of course.

09:31.100 --> 09:32.433
We'd love to read your book,

09:32.433 --> 09:34.133
especially if it means
getting you back.

09:34.133 --> 09:35.333
Thank you so much.

09:35.333 --> 09:36.767
I'll email you a PDF
right now.

09:36.767 --> 09:38.467
A what?

09:38.467 --> 09:39.500
Personal call?

09:39.500 --> 09:41.067
Oh, uh, no.
I finished all my w--

09:41.067 --> 09:42.167
Oh, my God, if you have
conjunctivitis,

09:42.167 --> 09:43.833
you need to leave.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.700
Once someone in the bullpen
gets that, everyone has it.

09:45.700 --> 09:46.800
It's like kennel cough.

09:46.800 --> 09:50.400
No, I--I got this
from dodgeball.

09:50.400 --> 09:53.333
Oh. Cute.
My niece plays dodgeball.

09:53.333 --> 09:54.667
She also calls jeans
"hard pants"

09:54.667 --> 09:56.067
because she's six.

09:56.067 --> 09:57.467
Feel free to go home
and slap a patch on that.

09:57.467 --> 09:59.500
No, actually, I'd like to stay
and do some work.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.367
I--I found a book
in the slush pile

10:02.367 --> 10:04.933
that I'm kind of
excited about.

10:04.933 --> 10:06.500
You're excited
about the slush pile.

10:06.500 --> 10:07.767
Oh, well, perfect.

10:07.767 --> 10:09.133
Then, when you're done
with those,

10:09.133 --> 10:11.567
you can read my junk mail.

10:19.333 --> 10:21.333
Do you want to split
an appetizer?

10:21.333 --> 10:24.533
Yeah, uh,
maybe the "geh-nocchi"?

10:26.033 --> 10:27.733
Actually, it's pronounced
"gnocchi."

10:27.733 --> 10:29.100
What?

10:29.100 --> 10:31.067
Why hasn't anybody
ever told me this?

10:31.067 --> 10:33.533
'Cause you do it
so cute.

10:33.533 --> 10:37.067
It's okay; it's like
the most mispronounced food.

10:37.067 --> 10:38.967
And I took a little Italian
in college, so...

10:38.967 --> 10:40.433
Oh, really?

10:40.433 --> 10:43.167
You're fancy
like that, hmm?

10:43.167 --> 10:44.767
Do you speak
any other languages?

10:44.767 --> 10:46.233
No, I mean,

10:46.233 --> 10:48.900
I took Spanish for a year
in high school, but...

10:48.900 --> 10:51.867
And then after high school,
you just traveled?

10:51.867 --> 10:54.700
Yeah, uh, I guess
I just traveled.

10:54.700 --> 10:56.367
No, I mean,
no college?

10:56.367 --> 10:58.000
I mean, in between
Europe and Asia,

10:58.000 --> 11:00.167
I--I went back
to West Virginia

11:00.167 --> 11:02.067
for a little bit
and enrolled in some college.

11:02.067 --> 11:04.167
Oh, cool.
What was your major?

11:04.167 --> 11:07.733
Smoking weed.
Yeah.

11:07.733 --> 11:10.067
Unfortunately, I was never
really able to declare it

11:10.067 --> 11:12.733
because I only stayed
for a semester, but...

11:12.733 --> 11:14.767
Well, have you ever
thought about going back?

11:14.767 --> 11:17.133
Mm, God, never.
No.

11:17.133 --> 11:18.600
Well, that's okay;
I mean, you know,

11:18.600 --> 11:20.867
a lot of people who didn't
get a great education

11:20.867 --> 11:22.700
can self-educate
with books.

11:25.233 --> 11:28.267
Wait, so is this--
is this whole

11:28.267 --> 11:30.267
me not reading, like,
actually a problem for you?

11:30.267 --> 11:33.933
No, it's just books
and reading are my life.

11:33.933 --> 11:35.300
I--I work in publishing.

11:35.300 --> 11:37.500
Yeah, and I'm
a visual person.

11:37.500 --> 11:40.167
I get turned on
by what I feel

11:40.167 --> 11:42.367
and what I see,

11:42.367 --> 11:45.167
not by just some words.

11:45.167 --> 11:49.200
Of course.
That's right--tattoos.

11:49.200 --> 11:52.700
Tattoos.
Tattoos.

11:52.700 --> 11:54.933
Is that all that you think
that I'm about, though?

11:54.933 --> 11:56.367
Of course not.

11:56.367 --> 11:59.600
[sighs]
That's good.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.533
You know what?
I--I'm actually--

12:01.533 --> 12:03.500
I'm just gonna tell you
some things about me

12:03.500 --> 12:05.967
because I'm not really sure
you've been paying attention.

12:05.967 --> 12:11.533
So I am the type of guy
that likes to play bad music

12:11.533 --> 12:14.633
with his buddies
at the bar around the corner.

12:14.633 --> 12:18.100
I'm someone who actually enjoys
listening to the J train

12:18.100 --> 12:19.600
as it's rattling
outside my window

12:19.600 --> 12:21.200
because I know that
it's filled

12:21.200 --> 12:23.500
with all kinds
of wonderful people

12:23.500 --> 12:26.067
that are just living
their lives.

12:26.067 --> 12:28.767
I like smoggy sunsets,

12:28.767 --> 12:30.267
I like smoking pot,

12:30.267 --> 12:34.267
and I would much rather
experience the world

12:34.267 --> 12:37.733
than read about it
in some book.

12:37.733 --> 12:39.433
Of course.
I know that.

12:39.433 --> 12:41.600
Do you?

12:41.600 --> 12:44.833
'Cause I--'cause I'm not
really sure that you do.

12:44.833 --> 12:47.267
Hey.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.800
- Come on.
- [sighs]

12:48.800 --> 12:50.133
All right.

12:50.133 --> 12:51.733
You know what?
Maybe, uh...

12:51.733 --> 12:54.733
Maybe I don't really know
that much about you, either.

13:04.333 --> 13:06.267
Hey.

13:06.267 --> 13:08.767
Is there a liquor store
in the area that gift-wraps?

13:08.767 --> 13:10.600
I need a really good
bottle of tequila

13:10.600 --> 13:11.933
that can make a guy
blind drunk

13:11.933 --> 13:13.800
and forget everything
I said to him last night.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.867
Uh-oh.
What happened?

13:15.867 --> 13:17.667
Ugh, I let Josh see
the real me,

13:17.667 --> 13:20.433
the self-sabotaging,
40-year-old New Jersey housewife

13:20.433 --> 13:22.767
who couldn't just let
a good thing stay that way.

13:22.767 --> 13:24.067
Wait, you told him
you're 40?

13:24.067 --> 13:26.133
No, but I behaved
that way--

13:26.133 --> 13:30.267
critical, judgmental--
like I have any right.

13:30.267 --> 13:32.067
And, Maggie,
he is so wonderful.

13:32.067 --> 13:35.700
He's heartfelt
and deep,

13:35.700 --> 13:38.067
and I just screwed it
all up.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.667
It's like if I was
really 26

13:39.667 --> 13:42.167
and I could start
all over,

13:42.167 --> 13:44.433
that is the man
I'd be falling in love with.

13:44.433 --> 13:46.767
Okay, well,
he's so wonderful,

13:46.767 --> 13:48.833
and you're so wonderful,
and--

13:48.833 --> 13:50.233
Wait, did you just
say love?

13:50.233 --> 13:53.100
Only in the most
speculative of terms.

13:53.100 --> 13:56.200
Stop using the fancy words
and tell me how you really feel.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.733
Okay, first of all,
I know this is gonna end,

13:58.733 --> 14:00.100
and it's gonna end badly.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.700
Well, if that's
what you believe,

14:01.700 --> 14:04.533
it's probably why you're
trying to push him away.

14:04.533 --> 14:07.233
You're right.
I guess I was trying to do that.

14:07.233 --> 14:09.667
It sounds like
you succeeded.

14:09.667 --> 14:12.067
Spectacularly.

14:17.867 --> 14:20.400
[doorbell rings]

14:22.067 --> 14:23.900
- Hi!
- Hey!

14:23.900 --> 14:25.467
- [laughs]
- Hi. Nice to see you.

14:25.467 --> 14:27.433
- You too. Come in, come in.
- Hi!

14:27.433 --> 14:29.867
- Hey, stranger!
- Nice to see you.

14:29.867 --> 14:31.133
- You too.
- Hi.

14:31.133 --> 14:32.567
Oh, my God.
Does she hit you?

14:32.567 --> 14:34.500
What? No. Who?

14:34.500 --> 14:36.067
There was a rumor
you went to Brooklyn

14:36.067 --> 14:38.100
to be with that
lesbian friend.

14:38.100 --> 14:40.167
It wasn't me,
but now I get

14:40.167 --> 14:42.067
why the setup with Richard
didn't work out,

14:42.067 --> 14:43.833
which is fine;
I'm cool.

14:43.833 --> 14:47.067
Oh, I got this from a city
sports league that I joined,

14:47.067 --> 14:49.067
and I moved to Brooklyn
because my friend,

14:49.067 --> 14:50.333
who happens to be gay,

14:50.333 --> 14:52.200
is graciously
letting me crash.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.300
Whatever you say.
It's none of our business.

14:54.300 --> 14:56.367
I watch Ellen
every day.

14:58.933 --> 15:01.900
Oh, all right.
Who wants to go first?

15:01.900 --> 15:04.100
(Michelle)
Well, I printed
a copy of mine out

15:04.100 --> 15:05.533
and underlined some passages

15:05.533 --> 15:07.300
I thought were
particularly significant.

15:07.300 --> 15:08.833
Would that be
a good place to start?

15:08.833 --> 15:11.433
It's great, but, real quick,
I'm just curious.

15:11.433 --> 15:13.433
Who liked the book?
Be honest.

15:13.433 --> 15:16.067
- Oh, I--I loved it.
- Loved.

15:16.067 --> 15:17.267
- Me too.
- It's so good.

15:17.267 --> 15:18.633
It's Winter's Bone meets

15:18.633 --> 15:20.300
Sisterhood of
the Traveling Pants.

15:20.300 --> 15:21.633
Meets The Alchemist.

15:21.633 --> 15:23.433
I mean, the whole thing
is a parable, right?

15:23.433 --> 15:24.833
I agree with Michelle.
Look.

15:24.833 --> 15:27.233
I even wrote, "Parable?"
on the cover.

15:27.233 --> 15:29.233
What'd you think, Lori?

15:29.233 --> 15:31.467
Oh, honestly, I haven't
read a book since college.

15:31.467 --> 15:33.100
I just come here
for the cocktails.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.567
Sometimes she naps.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.400
Well, I think
it's genius.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.367
I tried to look up some
of the author's other work,

15:38.367 --> 15:39.900
but I couldn't
find anything online.

15:39.900 --> 15:41.733
That's because she's
never been published.

15:41.733 --> 15:43.500
- Oh, you're kidding.
- What do you mean?

15:43.500 --> 15:45.433
She's never been--
how is that possible?

15:45.433 --> 15:47.067
I know.
It's hard to believe.

15:47.067 --> 15:50.500
An editor friend of mine
discovered her.

15:50.500 --> 15:54.067
This friend needs
to get this published.

15:54.067 --> 15:56.767
Yes, she does.

15:56.767 --> 15:58.133
Thank you guys
so much.

15:58.133 --> 15:59.367
- So good to see you.
- Thank you.

15:59.367 --> 16:02.133
- Drive safely.
- Bye. Okay.

Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.200
Hey.

16:06.200 --> 16:08.267
It was so good
to see you!

16:08.267 --> 16:10.200
It was so good
to see you too, Lori.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.600
[panting]

16:17.633 --> 16:21.867
You know, sometimes
I fantasize about being...

16:21.867 --> 16:24.333
in Brooklyn.

16:24.333 --> 16:25.633
- Okay.
- Okay. All right.

16:25.633 --> 16:27.100
- I got to go.
- You--you got to go.

16:27.100 --> 16:28.300
- Yeah.
- Okay, so me too.

16:28.300 --> 16:29.500
All right.
Be safe.

16:29.500 --> 16:30.700
- Good night. You too.
- Okay.

16:30.700 --> 16:31.767
Thank you.

16:31.767 --> 16:33.233
- All right.
- Bye-bye.

16:33.233 --> 16:34.833
Okay, bye.
It's just you're so pretty.

16:34.833 --> 16:36.367
Just don't let anything...

16:36.367 --> 16:39.100
I'm gonna stop talking.
Okay. Who's got my keys?

but look.

17:22.433 --> 17:24.099
Some of the women
from book club

17:24.099 --> 17:26.767
posted great reviews
of The Scarf on Goodreads.

17:26.767 --> 17:28.233
Oh, my God.
They all loved it.

17:28.233 --> 17:30.833
I know, and now all these
other people on the site

17:30.833 --> 17:32.633
are wondering
how they can find it.

What are you doing now?

17:36.833 --> 17:39.300
I'm telling them
to contact Empirical Press

17:39.300 --> 17:41.933
and demand that we
publish the book.

17:41.933 --> 17:45.067
Hey, what do those housewives
do at book club, anyway?

17:45.067 --> 17:47.133

you know, got a little

maybe even put
your arm around me.

18:25.267 --> 18:27.633
And then along the way,
I'd say something charming,

18:27.633 --> 18:30.400
and maybe you'd
forgive me.

18:33.067 --> 18:34.267
It's kind of
a stupid plan,

18:34.267 --> 18:38.633
but sometimes,
I'm kind of stupid.

18:38.633 --> 18:40.933
Oh, did--
did you realize

18:40.933 --> 18:42.533
that we have
something in common?

18:42.533 --> 18:44.833
That is not
what I meant.

18:44.833 --> 18:48.067
I don't think
you're stupid.

18:48.067 --> 18:51.567
[sighs]
Okay.

18:51.567 --> 18:54.500
Why is it such a big deal
to you that I don't read?

18:54.500 --> 18:59.300
Honestly, I think I was
just looking for a problem.

18:59.300 --> 19:02.567
I just don't want to be
blindsided by one down the road.

19:02.567 --> 19:05.900
I feel like I can't trust
how happy I am.

19:07.633 --> 19:08.967
Wow.

19:08.967 --> 19:11.733
Okay.

19:11.733 --> 19:13.300
Do you know what--

19:13.300 --> 19:16.200
what my takeaway is
from hearing all that?

19:16.200 --> 19:18.267
That I'm prone
to emotional sabotage

19:18.267 --> 19:20.767
and have some
past relationship baggage?

19:20.767 --> 19:22.767
No.

19:22.767 --> 19:27.600
It's that I'm emotionally
way smarter than you.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.667
[chuckles]

19:29.667 --> 19:31.067
And better at dodgeball.

19:31.067 --> 19:33.067
So much better
at dodgeball.

19:33.067 --> 19:35.067
[both laugh]

19:37.067 --> 19:40.067
Good thing you're so cute,
you know that?

19:40.067 --> 19:42.900
Just coast
on them good looks.

19:42.900 --> 19:44.567
So you forgive me?

19:46.433 --> 19:48.067
No. No.

19:48.067 --> 19:49.433
Not so fast.

19:49.433 --> 19:51.833
There's a pop quiz later...

19:51.833 --> 19:53.300
clothing optional.

19:53.300 --> 19:55.300
- Okay.
- [mutters]

19:55.300 --> 19:58.833
Okay, come on.
[laughs]

19:58.833 --> 20:00.267
[whack]

20:00.267 --> 20:01.867
[chuckles]
What's up, Jen?

20:04.267 --> 20:05.367
[laughs]

20:05.367 --> 20:08.367
[upbeat music]

20:08.367 --> 20:09.967
*

20:09.967 --> 20:11.667
(woman)
* Mm, mm, mm

20:11.667 --> 20:13.767
I love this area.

20:13.767 --> 20:15.767
It's my favorite
neighborhood.

20:15.767 --> 20:17.367
What's it called?

20:17.367 --> 20:19.500
Dumbo.

20:19.500 --> 20:20.967
[both laugh]

20:20.967 --> 20:22.967
It's beautiful.

20:22.967 --> 20:26.133
(woman)
* I'm seeing stars *

20:26.133 --> 20:28.667
* Mm, mm, mm

20:28.667 --> 20:31.933
* I'm seeing stars *

20:31.933 --> 20:34.167
* Mm, mm

20:34.167 --> 20:36.967
* I'm seeing stars *

20:37.305 --> 20:43.684
