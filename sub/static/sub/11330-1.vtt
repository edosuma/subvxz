<i>Previously on The Secret Life of</i>
<i>the American Teenager...</i>

00:02.981 --> 00:04.882
I'm getting our things
ready for the hospital.

00:04.916 --> 00:06.283
Do you think that this...

00:07.585 --> 00:08.719
This could be it?

00:08.753 --> 00:10.053
Could be.

00:10.088 --> 00:12.589
Everything about Africa,
it just makes me feel so alive.

00:12.624 --> 00:14.391
That's why I want
to go back, Kathleen.

00:14.425 --> 00:15.826
Obviously I want you
to come with me.

00:15.860 --> 00:17.394
Tom and Grace can come too.

00:17.428 --> 00:19.463
I mean, that's an amazing opportunity
for them to see the world.

00:19.497 --> 00:20.831
Did you feel
the baby move?

00:20.865 --> 00:23.967
No. But I'm thinking maybe she's
just getting into position

00:24.002 --> 00:25.636
to, you know,
make her way out.

00:25.670 --> 00:27.070
Let's see
what's going on.

00:29.073 --> 00:30.507
You tested out
of high school?

00:30.542 --> 00:32.543
We were thinking about
driving across America.

00:32.577 --> 00:33.877
That was Ben.

00:33.912 --> 00:35.112
Is everything okay?

00:35.146 --> 00:36.613
No, everything's
not okay.

00:36.648 --> 00:39.516
I'll call you as soon as I know
how serious this is, all right?

00:40.852 --> 00:42.386
I love you, Leo.

00:42.420 --> 00:44.521
<i>Who is this woman with two</i>
<i>children that wants to marry Tom?</i>

00:44.556 --> 00:46.156
I mean, is she after
his money or something?

00:46.191 --> 00:47.424
I don't want
to be in a situation

00:47.458 --> 00:48.892
where I'm forced
to run away from home.

00:48.927 --> 00:50.427
Let me do
what I wanna do.

00:50.461 --> 00:52.563
I've got some bad
news for all of you.

00:52.597 --> 00:54.231
The baby passed away.

01:02.540 --> 01:05.876
Okay, okay,
okay, stop it!

01:05.910 --> 01:07.044
John's in there.

01:07.078 --> 01:08.679
And?

01:08.713 --> 01:13.684
And I have to
get home and change,

01:13.718 --> 01:17.287
and shower and, uh,
get him cleaned up

01:17.322 --> 01:18.488
and to the nursery and...

01:18.523 --> 01:19.656
Bye, bye, Mommy.

01:20.825 --> 01:22.025
Come, Mommy.

01:22.060 --> 01:23.861
Daddy will take you.

01:23.895 --> 01:25.596
Daddy will take you
to the nursery.

01:29.234 --> 01:30.934
I can't believe
we slept over here again.

01:30.969 --> 01:32.102
Why not?

01:32.136 --> 01:34.571
John likes sleeping over here.
And so do you.

01:34.606 --> 01:37.541
No, I love
sleeping over here.

01:37.575 --> 01:39.343
That's why I plan to
sleep over here all summer.

01:40.078 --> 01:43.180
But during the week, it makes
the mornings a little crazy.

01:43.214 --> 01:44.348
Or crazier.

01:44.382 --> 01:46.016
And it makes
the nights crazy too.

01:46.484 --> 01:47.651
Yeah.

01:47.685 --> 01:51.154
You know it would be easier
if you actually moved here.

01:51.189 --> 01:53.523
Brought the rest of your
things and John's things.

01:53.558 --> 01:54.992
You're practically
living here anyway.

01:55.026 --> 01:56.093
You're here all the time.

01:56.628 --> 01:58.462
I'm not here all the time.
Most of the time.

01:58.496 --> 02:00.530
For the past couple of months,
most of the time.

02:00.798 --> 02:04.234
Most of the time is not all of the time.
There's a big difference.

02:06.237 --> 02:08.372
I don't know.

02:08.406 --> 02:11.808
Ashley is taking off
with Toby today and...

02:11.843 --> 02:14.344
And you can't leave your dad
for the father of your son?

02:15.613 --> 02:18.515
Yeah, that doesn't
sound right, does it?

02:18.917 --> 02:20.817
No, it doesn't.

02:20.818 --> 02:23.086
And you can't let him tell you
that you have to stay there

02:23.121 --> 02:25.989
when he and your mom are letting
Ashley travel cross-country

02:26.024 --> 02:27.424
with her boyfriend
at 16.

02:27.458 --> 02:28.926
Yeah. She is.

02:29.727 --> 02:34.231
But, I mean, she graduated
from high school, technically.

02:34.265 --> 02:36.199
And she's too young
to go to college,

02:36.234 --> 02:37.367
even if she could get in.

02:38.236 --> 02:41.939
My mom thinks that it will teach
her the value of education,

02:41.973 --> 02:43.640
And that she'll learn
more about the United States

02:43.675 --> 02:44.775
seeing it than
reading about it.

02:45.276 --> 02:46.944
I can't believe
they're buying that.

02:46.978 --> 02:48.412
It's better for
two sixteen-year-olds

02:48.479 --> 02:50.213
to drive across the country
than go to school?

02:50.248 --> 02:52.950
Well, not all sixteen-year-olds,
just those two.

02:52.984 --> 02:55.218
I mean, maybe
it sounds little crazy,

02:55.253 --> 02:56.853
but, hey, so are we.

02:56.888 --> 02:58.455
I mean, I'm a junior
in high school

02:58.489 --> 03:01.959
and I'm actually thinking about
the three of us living together.

03:01.993 --> 03:04.361
Me and my baby
and the father of my baby.

03:04.395 --> 03:07.364
It's kind of surreal.

03:08.199 --> 03:09.466
I don't know.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.001
I feel as if
we're playing house

03:11.035 --> 03:14.972
more than I feel
that this is our house,

03:15.006 --> 03:16.340
and our family.

03:16.374 --> 03:18.608
I mean, if you want to make
it our house and our family.

03:18.643 --> 03:21.745
I do. I want you and
John to live here.

03:21.779 --> 03:23.647
The three of us together.

03:23.681 --> 03:25.682
It feels right.
It feels good even.

03:26.317 --> 03:29.987
We've been talking about this long enough.
Let's just do it. Move in.

03:30.021 --> 03:33.357
All right, what we've been talking
about is waiting until summer.

03:33.391 --> 03:35.625
Waiting until school is out
and then moving in together.

03:35.660 --> 03:37.794
I know, but it just hasn't
worked out that way.

03:37.829 --> 03:40.364
We're pretty much living together now.
The three of us.

03:42.133 --> 03:43.633
Okay.

03:43.668 --> 03:45.569
Now. Right now. Today.

03:46.104 --> 03:48.472
I said okay!

03:48.506 --> 03:50.974
As of today,
I live here.

03:51.009 --> 03:54.344
We live here.
John and me and you.

03:56.280 --> 03:58.615
Are you going to say anything
to your mom and dad?

03:58.649 --> 04:00.884
'Cause if you say
anything to either of them,

04:00.918 --> 04:02.552
you make a big
announcement or something,

04:02.587 --> 04:03.987
it's not going to happen.
You know that.

04:04.022 --> 04:06.456
You can't really expect them
to tell me that it's okay.

04:06.491 --> 04:08.759
Because it just wouldn't
be right for two parents

04:08.793 --> 04:10.994
to tell their teenage daughter that
she can live with her boyfriend.

04:11.029 --> 04:13.063
I think I'm a
little more than a boyfriend.

04:13.097 --> 04:14.831
Yeah, little more
than a boyfriend

04:14.866 --> 04:16.933
and a little less
than a husband.

04:16.968 --> 04:19.369
So, I don't think we're going
to get their approval.

04:20.171 --> 04:23.440
But we do have a son

04:24.208 --> 04:25.475
and I do love you.

04:27.145 --> 04:28.712
And like you said,

04:28.746 --> 04:31.615
we've been practically living here for
the past few months anyway. So...

04:31.649 --> 04:33.950
So, what's the
hesitation about?

04:33.985 --> 04:37.387
Just hope it doesn't seem
insensitive to other people.

04:37.422 --> 04:40.257
Insensitive, how?
To what other people?

04:40.291 --> 04:42.759
Adrian is going through
hell, and I'm not.

04:44.529 --> 04:45.796
I just feel
a little guilty

04:45.830 --> 04:47.564
that things worked out
so badly for them

04:47.598 --> 04:49.332
and not so badly for us.

04:49.367 --> 04:51.535
No, no, no.
You can't not move in with me

04:51.569 --> 04:54.704
because you feel guilty
about being happy, Amy.

04:54.739 --> 04:57.441
Whatever happens with
Ben and Adrian happens.

04:57.475 --> 04:59.743
Whatever that is,
it shouldn't affect us.

05:00.545 --> 05:04.014
I feel badly for both of
them, but I'm happy for us.

05:04.749 --> 05:07.284
The three of us,
we're a family.

05:07.952 --> 05:10.487
Yeah, we are a family,
aren't we?

05:10.521 --> 05:12.155
Yeah. We are, Amy.

05:12.190 --> 05:14.458
And I'm not going to
let anyone change that.

05:14.492 --> 05:16.693
And I'm not going to do anything
that would jeopardize that.

05:18.029 --> 05:19.229
Yeah, I know that.

05:22.733 --> 05:26.903
Well, I will see you tonight,
and I guess every night.

05:27.672 --> 05:28.939
Yeah, you will, Amy.

06:07.543 --> 06:09.077
so, uh, next year.

06:09.111 --> 06:10.945
No, really,
like I said,

06:11.981 --> 06:14.382
maybe I'll just take
the GED, like Ashley.

06:15.117 --> 06:17.452
The "good enough" diploma?

06:17.486 --> 06:19.387
That's not good
enough for my wife.

06:20.022 --> 06:22.457
You and me, we're going
to graduate together.

06:22.491 --> 06:24.225
If you don't want to go
back to our high school,

06:24.259 --> 06:25.326
we can find another one.

06:25.361 --> 06:26.561
No.

06:28.163 --> 06:29.964
I decided

06:29.999 --> 06:31.899
I'll go with the
GED or something.

06:32.768 --> 06:34.869
Okay, I don't know,
I don't really care.

06:35.504 --> 06:37.772
Just tell Amy
I said hello.

06:37.806 --> 06:39.507
Oh, and Grace, too.

06:40.075 --> 06:42.076
Well, if you see Grant,
tell him to tell her.

06:42.111 --> 06:43.778
She's going to
be back in a week

06:43.812 --> 06:45.813
and she's going
to want to see you.

06:45.848 --> 06:48.783
And Amy wants
to see you right now,

06:48.817 --> 06:50.752
any time you'll let her
come over here.

06:51.620 --> 06:54.322
Aren't you getting
just a little tired

06:54.356 --> 06:57.125
of communicating through
texts and emails?

06:57.659 --> 06:59.093
And don't you want
to see your friends?

07:00.662 --> 07:03.598
Well, um, I'm going
to go to school,

07:04.466 --> 07:06.134
and then I'm going
to go to work,

07:06.168 --> 07:08.836
and then I'm going to go over to my
dad's tonight for dinner after work.

07:08.871 --> 07:10.271
I know.

07:10.305 --> 07:12.540
You told me.
Three times.

07:13.742 --> 07:15.410
It's okay.
Just go have a good time.

07:18.414 --> 07:19.914
Try and have a good time.

07:19.948 --> 07:21.149
I wish
you'd go with me.

07:23.685 --> 07:24.786
I'll get dinner for you.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.120
It's okay.
I'll order in.

07:32.294 --> 07:33.494
Adrian...
No.

07:36.665 --> 07:39.100
You do what
you have to do,

07:39.535 --> 07:42.136
and I'm going to do
what I have to do.

07:43.372 --> 07:44.505
And right now,

07:45.908 --> 07:47.208
this is what
I have to do.

07:47.242 --> 07:48.543
You don't have to.

07:49.278 --> 07:51.646
It's not going to do you
any good or me any good.

07:52.881 --> 07:54.782
It's not going
to bring her back,

07:55.784 --> 07:57.285
hiding here in the condo.

07:59.455 --> 08:00.955
It's not, Adrian.

08:00.989 --> 08:02.156
And

08:03.459 --> 08:04.759
it's been two months.

08:05.461 --> 08:08.629
She would have been
eight weeks old today.

08:08.664 --> 08:09.864
I know that.

08:11.533 --> 08:12.800
I know, Adrian.

08:14.837 --> 08:16.270
She was my daughter, too.

08:16.305 --> 08:18.673
I know how old
she would have been. But...

08:20.576 --> 08:23.377
Adrian, I can't just
lock myself away.

08:24.780 --> 08:26.280
I need to be
around people.

08:26.315 --> 08:29.784
I need to stay
busy with school

08:29.818 --> 08:33.020
or work, or be
with my dad or

08:34.756 --> 08:35.957
with you, Adrian.

08:38.527 --> 08:41.462
Please, let's just
go back to counseling.

08:41.496 --> 08:43.464
We can see someone
other than Dr. Fields.

08:43.499 --> 08:45.533
But you like Dr. Fields,

08:46.835 --> 08:49.704
and he's probably the best
person for you to talk to.

08:51.006 --> 08:52.273
It's just that,

08:53.041 --> 08:55.176
he was no help to me,

08:55.210 --> 09:00.581
and that's probably because
there's nothing anyone can say

09:00.616 --> 09:02.416
that's going to
make this okay.

09:03.352 --> 09:04.385
Nothing.

09:05.521 --> 09:07.355
I don't think the point
is for it to be okay,

09:07.389 --> 09:08.523
or for us to get over it.

09:08.557 --> 09:09.924
The point is for
us to live with it.

09:12.394 --> 09:13.728
You talked to Dr. Ottavi?

09:14.496 --> 09:15.563
About?

09:15.597 --> 09:18.132
About maybe getting
something that

09:19.134 --> 09:20.701
could help
you feel better?

09:20.736 --> 09:22.703
Yeah, I know
you called her.

09:22.738 --> 09:23.804
She told me.

09:25.541 --> 09:31.112
And I don't want any pills to
make me feel better, all right?

09:33.115 --> 09:35.516
And by the way,
she's not really my doctor.

09:35.551 --> 09:37.285
Her son is.
So deal with it.

09:37.686 --> 09:39.887
I just called her because

09:41.023 --> 09:42.957
she was the one
that was here that day,

09:42.991 --> 09:44.759
and I just,
I feel I know her better.

09:44.793 --> 09:46.060
I don't know
what to do here.

09:46.094 --> 09:48.796
Just stop trying
to do anything, okay?

09:49.765 --> 09:53.234
It's like I keep saying it
but it's like you're not listening.

09:54.369 --> 09:57.305
You do what
you need to do

09:57.339 --> 10:00.041
and I'm going to do
what I need to do.

10:00.742 --> 10:04.045
And this, this is
what I need to do.

10:04.079 --> 10:06.214
I need to stay home

10:06.248 --> 10:08.082
and watch the last
year of  <i>Oprah</i>

10:08.116 --> 10:10.718
and eat whatever
I feel like eating.

10:11.687 --> 10:14.322
I need to walk
in the nursery

10:14.356 --> 10:16.357
and look in
the baby's crib

10:16.391 --> 10:18.926
and imagine what
she would look like,

10:19.962 --> 10:23.364
what she'd be wearing,
what she'd be doing.

10:23.398 --> 10:24.966
That's what I need to do.

10:25.801 --> 10:27.868
I don't think it's healthy
hanging out in the nursery.

10:27.903 --> 10:29.437
What are you saying?
I'm fat?

10:29.471 --> 10:31.105
I'm saying
you're beautiful.

10:32.307 --> 10:33.441
And I love you.

10:35.410 --> 10:36.844
I'll call you
tonight, okay?

10:38.447 --> 10:39.680
See you.

10:52.527 --> 10:54.395
I don't see why it's such
a horrible idea.

10:54.429 --> 10:55.863
It would get her
out of the house.

10:55.897 --> 10:58.733
First time out of the house would
be to go to the baby's grave?

10:58.767 --> 11:01.636
Maybe she needs that.
To go there, to grieve.

11:01.670 --> 11:04.005
Maybe she needs to bring all that
grief to the surface, you know?

11:04.039 --> 11:05.139
Let it all out.

11:05.173 --> 11:07.108
Run it by Dr. Fields.
See what he says.

11:07.142 --> 11:09.343
I don't care what he says.
He really wasn't that much help.

11:09.378 --> 11:12.546
Well, that's because both you and Adrian
decided that you don't want any help.

11:12.581 --> 11:14.782
I found the guy very
helpful and so did Ben.

11:14.816 --> 11:17.251
You could have been more supportive
of the family therapy, you know.

11:17.286 --> 11:19.720
Why can't you help her?
I tried, Ruben.

11:19.755 --> 11:21.155
Well, try harder.

11:21.189 --> 11:23.124
She talked to you for
the first couple of weeks.

11:23.158 --> 11:24.725
Maybe you said something
that made her feel bad.

11:24.760 --> 11:27.595
No, I didn't. Did you say
something that made her feel bad?

11:27.629 --> 11:28.763
Because she's not
talking to you either.

11:28.797 --> 11:30.998
I'm her father.
You're her mother.

11:31.033 --> 11:32.400
This is
a mother-daughter thing.

11:32.434 --> 11:33.634
You don't believe that.

11:33.669 --> 11:35.303
You just don't know
what to say to her either.

11:35.337 --> 11:37.305
No, I don't.

11:38.707 --> 11:40.107
I just want to
make her feel better.

11:40.142 --> 11:41.642
Well,

11:42.077 --> 11:43.944
I don't think
we can do that.

11:43.979 --> 11:48.082
We both want her to feel better
but it's out of our control.

11:48.116 --> 11:51.218
And all we can do is just
tell her that we love her

11:51.253 --> 11:53.487
and that we're there
if she needs us.

11:54.489 --> 11:55.656
She just nee more time.

11:55.691 --> 11:57.224
Time to do what?

11:57.259 --> 12:00.094
Sit at home and watch TV and stuff
her face until she's more depressed?

12:00.128 --> 12:01.862
For now, yes.
And you're just going to go to work?

12:01.930 --> 12:04.999
I stayed home for a month.
I took a month off.

12:05.033 --> 12:08.869
I worked hard so I could take a month off.
So, I have to go to work.

12:08.904 --> 12:10.037
You could quit.

12:10.072 --> 12:11.472
I'll see you at
the end of the week.

12:12.107 --> 12:13.407
If you're still here.

12:22.084 --> 12:23.951
I'm not going anywhere.

12:23.985 --> 12:26.153
It's my house,
why would I go anywhere?

12:36.898 --> 12:39.367
I told you, I don't
want to talk to anyone.

12:39.401 --> 12:40.768
I'm fine, okay?

12:40.802 --> 12:42.937
Just leave me alone.
I'm fine.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.805
Can I bring lunch over today?
No.

12:46.241 --> 12:47.508
Look, just please don't.

12:47.542 --> 12:49.977
I don't feel like
having lunch with you.

12:50.011 --> 12:51.912
No offense.
None taken.

12:53.248 --> 12:54.882
But if you need me...
Dad,

12:56.251 --> 12:57.418
I love you,

12:58.120 --> 13:00.087
but I don't need you.

13:00.122 --> 13:02.089
I need to be alone.

13:02.124 --> 13:04.558
Okay, Adrian.
Love you, too.

13:05.026 --> 13:06.026
Bye.

13:24.913 --> 13:27.281
I'm sorry about
the way I left just now.

13:28.216 --> 13:30.117
It's just that
I'm worried about you.

13:30.886 --> 13:33.287
Who called you?
My mom?

13:33.722 --> 13:36.557
She texted me.
But I was on my way back in.

13:37.626 --> 13:40.594
I don't like everyone
worrying about me.

13:40.629 --> 13:41.996
It's a burden.

13:43.899 --> 13:47.735
And I don't need the burden
of everyone worrying about me

13:48.503 --> 13:51.772
on top of
losing my baby.

13:51.807 --> 13:55.943
Well, maybe, everyone wouldn't
worry about you so much

13:55.977 --> 13:59.780
if you could just
give us some indication

13:59.815 --> 14:01.549
that you're feeling
any better...

14:01.583 --> 14:03.017
I don't want to feel better!

14:03.051 --> 14:05.319
Okay, well, then we're right
back to where we started,

14:05.353 --> 14:06.587
so I'll just say goodbye.

14:06.621 --> 14:08.322
Goodbye. Love you.

14:08.824 --> 14:10.291
Love you, Adrian.

14:23.131 --> 14:25.499
You're treating me
like a baby.

14:26.936 --> 14:29.871
Because I won't let your
girlfriend, that I know nothing about,

14:29.905 --> 14:31.806
move into the
guest house with you?

14:32.508 --> 14:35.009
Tom, she's on welfare,

14:35.044 --> 14:39.047
she has two children,
and she's too old for you.

14:39.081 --> 14:44.485
It's not about how old
I am or how old she is.

14:44.520 --> 14:49.424
You think I'm not smart enough
to be with a girl like her.

14:49.458 --> 14:52.760
No, honey, that's not it.
I think you're smart.

14:52.795 --> 14:56.364
I just, I don't think you think
things through sometimes,

14:56.398 --> 14:58.299
and this is
one of those times.

14:58.334 --> 15:01.102
Think it through for me.
Please. Go ahead.

15:01.136 --> 15:03.371
Let's just say the two of you
do end up getting married,

15:03.405 --> 15:06.441
and then she changes her
mind and wants a divorce.

15:07.376 --> 15:09.444
She would get
half your money, Tom.

15:10.079 --> 15:11.980
The money your
birth mother left you,

15:12.014 --> 15:14.215
the money you've
earned and saved.

15:14.250 --> 15:15.483
Half of that
would be gone.

15:15.517 --> 15:18.319
Then I have
half my money left.

15:18.654 --> 15:20.655
And she has
the other half!

15:20.689 --> 15:23.024
I'd say it,
"It was worth it."

15:23.058 --> 15:26.427
Tom, you would
give half of all you have

15:26.462 --> 15:30.465
to this woman just
to be close with her?

15:30.499 --> 15:31.666
Yes!

15:33.802 --> 15:35.236
It's not about sex.

15:35.271 --> 15:37.038
We are not
going to have sex.

15:37.539 --> 15:39.140
You would wanna
be with someone

15:39.174 --> 15:40.408
that didn't want
to have sex with you?

15:40.442 --> 15:43.444
I heard that happens a lot.

15:44.380 --> 15:46.481
Even right here
in this house.

15:46.515 --> 15:49.484
Because Jeff's not here.
He's in Africa.

15:49.518 --> 15:52.754
He's working in Africa because
that's what he wants to do,

15:52.788 --> 15:56.591
and I'm staying here because
that's what I want to do.

15:56.625 --> 16:01.629
And Rachel and I are going to live
together and that's what we want to do.

16:01.664 --> 16:03.364
I have to go to work.

16:10.072 --> 16:11.306
Bye, Tom.

16:13.842 --> 16:16.044
Hey, do you want me to drive Tom in today?
I've got time.

16:16.078 --> 16:19.080
No, I'm sure he wants to take
the bus so he can see Rachel.

16:19.114 --> 16:20.448
Yeah.

16:20.482 --> 16:22.450
I don't know what is
wrong with this woman.

16:22.484 --> 16:24.252
Does something have
to be wrong with her?

16:24.286 --> 16:25.987
Oh, you've been around
her more than I have.

16:26.021 --> 16:27.789
Is something
wrong with her?

16:28.757 --> 16:30.091
I don't know.
Fine.

16:30.125 --> 16:31.225
I'll find out for myself.

16:31.260 --> 16:32.760
I can find another
place to stay.

16:32.795 --> 16:34.262
We only have a few
more months left of school.

16:34.296 --> 16:37.598
Jack, you can stay in the house
if you need to, don't be silly.

16:37.633 --> 16:41.235
Who's being silly? Grace would definitely
not want me to live in the house.

16:41.270 --> 16:42.403
Neither would Grant.

16:42.438 --> 16:43.838
Grace isn't even
in the house.

16:43.872 --> 16:45.707
And Grant doesn't count.

16:45.741 --> 16:47.675
I never thought she'd
actually go to Zimbabwe,

16:47.710 --> 16:49.577
even just to volunteer
for two weeks.

16:49.611 --> 16:51.512
Hmm, Jeff convinced her it
would be good for her resume.

16:51.547 --> 16:52.980
Yeah, but
she's afraid of bugs,

16:53.015 --> 16:54.582
they got parasites
over there.

16:54.616 --> 16:57.018
They get into your eyes
and make you go blind

16:57.052 --> 17:00.121
or lay eggs in your brain
that cause seizures and...

17:01.123 --> 17:04.058
I'm sorry.
I'm sure she'll be fine.

17:04.093 --> 17:06.694
And Jeff, he'll be fine.
And you and Jeff will be fine.

17:06.729 --> 17:09.030
Yeah, well,
we'll give it some time,

17:09.464 --> 17:10.932
see if he really wants
to live over there.

17:10.965 --> 17:12.446
Or if you really
want to live over there.

17:12.448 --> 17:13.510
I don't.

17:13.535 --> 17:14.835
I thought you agreed
to think about it.

17:14.869 --> 17:16.371
Oh, I am thinking
about it.

17:16.405 --> 17:18.606
When I'm not thinking about who's living
or not living in the guest house.

17:19.474 --> 17:20.641
Right.

17:24.980 --> 17:26.714
Bye, Ashley.
Have a nice trip.

17:26.749 --> 17:29.517
Yeah, don't let the door hit you
in the butt on your way out.

17:31.487 --> 17:33.721
I said goodbye already.
What do you want, a hug?

17:33.756 --> 17:36.157
You know, this might be the
last time you ever see me.

17:38.894 --> 17:40.328
You're right.

17:41.230 --> 17:42.597
I'm sorry.

17:42.631 --> 17:44.031
Here...
I don't need a hug.

17:44.466 --> 17:45.600
That's not very nice.

17:47.035 --> 17:49.370
And you know, I'm a little
sensitive to statements like,

17:49.405 --> 17:51.339
"This might be the
last time you ever see me,"

17:51.373 --> 17:53.074
considering everything
that's happened.

17:53.108 --> 17:54.842
Oh, you're not
that sensitive.

17:54.877 --> 17:56.677
You and Ricky are having
the time of your lives

17:56.712 --> 17:58.546
while Ben and Adrian
are going through hell.

17:58.580 --> 17:59.680
You think that's wrong?

17:59.715 --> 18:02.016
Do you care what I think?
Yeah, kind of.

18:02.050 --> 18:04.485
I think it's a little weird for
you and Ricky to get together

18:04.520 --> 18:06.220
during this period
of mourning.

18:07.156 --> 18:09.424
I mean, you've waited
all this time, why now?

18:10.125 --> 18:11.726
'Cause I realized
how much I loved him.

18:11.760 --> 18:13.494
But you didn't before?

18:13.529 --> 18:15.530
What is it?
What are you getting at?

18:15.564 --> 18:17.698
The truth.
No matter how dark it is.

18:17.733 --> 18:19.333
And what dark truth
would that be?

18:19.368 --> 18:22.370
Adrian and Ben could
split up and if they do,

18:22.404 --> 18:23.805
you know she'll come
back for Ricky.

18:23.839 --> 18:26.073
Adrian and Ben are
not going to split up.

18:26.108 --> 18:27.508
If anything,
they're closer than ever,

18:27.543 --> 18:29.210
having been through
what they've been through.

18:29.244 --> 18:30.344
They are.

18:30.379 --> 18:32.180
And I'm not with Ricky to
keep him away from Adrian.

18:32.214 --> 18:34.248
I'm with Ricky
because I love him

18:34.283 --> 18:36.250
and he loves me and we
want to be together.

18:36.285 --> 18:37.585
And the two of us
and what we do

18:37.619 --> 18:39.220
has nothing to do with the two
of them and what they do.

18:39.488 --> 18:40.888
Whether they stay together
or they split up.

18:40.923 --> 18:44.025
So, now it's whether Adrian and
Ben stay together or split up,

18:44.059 --> 18:47.862
when just seconds ago they were not
splitting up, and they're closer than ever?

18:47.896 --> 18:49.130
I swear to you, Ashley.

18:49.164 --> 18:51.499
I am not moving in with Ricky
to keep him away from Adrian.

18:51.533 --> 18:52.800
Well, what about Ricky?

18:52.835 --> 18:55.102
Is he letting you move in to
keep himself from Adrian?

18:55.137 --> 18:56.838
No, he's not!
I know he's not.

18:56.872 --> 18:58.940
He loves me.
And I love him.

18:58.974 --> 19:00.274
And I love being
with him and our son

19:00.309 --> 19:02.109
in that little apartment
over the butcher shop.

19:03.545 --> 19:05.780
He makes me happy.
Why shouldn't I be happy?

19:06.181 --> 19:07.882
Okay, well,

19:08.584 --> 19:09.984
I hope you stay happy.

19:11.253 --> 19:12.420
And I mean that, Amy.

19:12.921 --> 19:14.722
I hope you get happy.

19:15.224 --> 19:16.357
I mean that, Ashley.

19:24.666 --> 19:25.733
Safe travels.

19:26.235 --> 19:27.235
Safe sex.

19:46.656 --> 19:48.056
So?

19:49.149 --> 19:50.420
I picked up
a few more things

19:50.421 --> 19:53.290
but my dad wasn't even there.
He went up to see Robie.

19:53.324 --> 19:55.292
Good, no big exit.
I like that.

19:55.326 --> 19:56.626
It's not like
you won't see him again.

19:56.661 --> 19:58.695
We'll go over there,
we'll have him over.

19:58.729 --> 19:59.996
We'll see him,
and your mom.

20:00.031 --> 20:02.132
Yeah, I'm not worried about it.
Good.

20:02.166 --> 20:03.733
Here's what I am
worried about.

20:03.768 --> 20:06.203
Oh, jeez. Don't worry
about anything.

20:06.237 --> 20:09.072
It's just that it's going to be very
obvious to Ben that I'm living with you.

20:09.106 --> 20:10.407
He knows you
stay over there.

20:10.441 --> 20:12.042
And it doesn't matter,
it's none of his business.

20:12.076 --> 20:14.344
Yeah, but he'll say
something to Adrian.

20:14.378 --> 20:16.980
Even though I know we don't want to
make any big announcement or anything,

20:17.014 --> 20:18.415
I still think
I should let her know.

20:18.449 --> 20:21.451
Why? We just talked
about this this morning.

20:21.485 --> 20:23.620
What we do has nothing
to do with what they do.

20:23.654 --> 20:25.889
I know, but I still would
rather tell her myself

20:25.923 --> 20:27.257
than have
someone else tell her.

20:28.626 --> 20:30.827
You think she'd be upset that we're
living together for some reason?

20:30.861 --> 20:33.463
Do you think she'd be upset that we're
living together for some reason?

20:33.497 --> 20:34.898
No.
Neither do I.

20:34.932 --> 20:36.733
So then what difference
does it make if she knows?

20:36.767 --> 20:38.368
What difference does it make
if she doesn't know?

20:38.402 --> 20:39.803
If the two of them
don't know?

20:39.837 --> 20:41.905
Ben and Adrian don't need to
know everything we're doing.

20:41.939 --> 20:43.006
No one does.

20:43.574 --> 20:46.176
Okay, okay.
I won't say anything.

20:46.210 --> 20:47.510
I just hope Ben
doesn't say anything.

20:47.545 --> 20:48.678
He's not going
to say anything.

20:48.713 --> 20:50.146
He doesn't know anything.

20:50.181 --> 20:52.215
I think
he's going to know.

20:52.250 --> 20:53.516
But whatever.

20:53.551 --> 20:54.884
Does she know about us?

20:54.919 --> 20:57.921
That the two of us are together,
that we're sleeping together?

20:57.955 --> 21:01.091
Um, yeah. I think
I might have mentioned it.

21:01.125 --> 21:02.792
Why did you want
her to know that?

21:02.827 --> 21:05.395
It's not that I wanted her to
know, or didn't want her to know.

21:05.429 --> 21:06.930
I think it just
came up in conversation.

21:06.964 --> 21:10.333
How does whether or not we're having
sex just come up in conversation?

21:10.368 --> 21:11.601
You're kidding, right?

21:12.303 --> 21:14.037
We're friends,
Adrian and me.

21:14.071 --> 21:15.772
I don't care if
you're friends with Adrian.

21:15.806 --> 21:17.440
It's nice that
you're friends with her.

21:17.875 --> 21:19.142
But don't get
too close, huh?

21:19.176 --> 21:22.279
Ricky, Adrian needs friends right now.
And so does Ben.

21:22.313 --> 21:24.948
I know, but I don't want you
and me and Ben and Adrian

21:24.982 --> 21:26.916
to be some kind
of weird foursome.

21:26.951 --> 21:28.251
We have our
lives together,

21:28.286 --> 21:29.386
and they have
their lives together.

21:29.420 --> 21:31.054
I get it.
I totally get it.

21:31.756 --> 21:33.356
But now that you understand
that Adrian already knows

21:33.391 --> 21:34.858
that we're
sleeping together,

21:34.892 --> 21:36.359
don't you think I should just tell
her that we're living together?

21:36.394 --> 21:38.328
No. Wait till she asks.

21:38.362 --> 21:39.529
Okay.

21:40.798 --> 21:42.632
Well, I'll see you
after work.

21:42.667 --> 21:44.167
Should I pick up
something for dinner?

21:44.201 --> 21:46.469
Do you ever pick up
anything for dinner?

21:46.504 --> 21:48.605
No, but I could.
I could even cook.

21:48.639 --> 21:51.007
I'll take care of dinner.
You just bring John home.

21:51.342 --> 21:55.478
Home. Yeah.
Okay.

21:55.513 --> 21:57.647
Um, I like
the sound of that.

21:59.083 --> 22:01.284
See you, um, at home.

22:17.201 --> 22:18.201
Hey.

22:18.936 --> 22:20.337
Good morning.
How are you?

22:20.371 --> 22:21.438
I'm fine.

22:22.440 --> 22:24.507
But I wish you'd stop
asking me that every morning

22:24.542 --> 22:26.876
because I'm never going to say anything
other than "fine" when I'm not.

22:26.911 --> 22:30.080
Okay, I'll stop asking.
And I'm sorry.

22:30.114 --> 22:32.749
I just don't know what to say
that I haven't said before.

22:34.218 --> 22:37.220
I'm just really sorry about
everything that happened, Ben.

22:37.254 --> 22:40.557
Ugh. And I know I say that every day, too.
I'm sorry again.

22:40.591 --> 22:43.360
It's okay.
And I didn't mean to snap at you.

22:44.295 --> 22:47.330
Look, is there any way you
could drop by our condo today

22:47.365 --> 22:49.065
and see if Adrian will let
you in to talk to her?

22:49.100 --> 22:51.267
I don't know.
I tried that before and...

22:55.072 --> 22:56.773
If she's not ready
to see me then...

22:56.807 --> 22:59.242
She has to talk to someone
other than me.

22:59.310 --> 23:01.811
I don't seem to be able to
say or do the right thing,

23:01.846 --> 23:03.046
no matter
what I say or do.

23:03.080 --> 23:05.181
Maybe you could just
try it one more time.

23:05.216 --> 23:07.450
I mean, somebody's
got to get to her.

23:07.485 --> 23:09.352
And do what?
Help her feel better.

23:09.387 --> 23:11.488
Or tell her to see
a doctor or a therapist

23:11.522 --> 23:13.323
or someone who can
help her feel better.

23:13.357 --> 23:15.058
I try not to
give her any advice.

23:15.092 --> 23:17.026
I just email her
and text her stuff

23:17.061 --> 23:19.496
that's going on
at school or with me.

23:20.030 --> 23:25.034
I'm afraid that if I try to get her to get
some help, that she might get offended.

23:25.069 --> 23:26.403
Please.

23:26.971 --> 23:28.605
I don't have anyone
else to turn to.

23:28.639 --> 23:31.441
You and Grace are her closest
friends and Grace isn't around.

23:31.475 --> 23:32.709
Okay.

23:33.544 --> 23:34.944
I mean,
it wouldn't hurt to try.

23:34.979 --> 23:37.414
Um, but I'm going to send her
a text or call her first.

23:37.448 --> 23:39.416
Fine, fine, but she's not going
to tell you to go over there,

23:39.450 --> 23:41.050
so, just go anyway.

23:41.085 --> 23:43.386
Okay? Even if you haven't
heard back from her. Please.

23:44.155 --> 23:45.388
Okay.

23:45.423 --> 23:47.490
Thank you, really. I...

23:48.526 --> 23:50.593
I think this might
help somehow.

23:50.628 --> 23:53.163
I don't know how
but I think it might.

23:56.400 --> 23:57.500
Hey, Ricky.

23:59.336 --> 24:03.773
Um, Ben just asked if I
could go talk to Adrian.

24:05.009 --> 24:06.276
What a coincidence.

24:06.310 --> 24:08.611
Yeah, um, I was
just telling Ricky

24:08.646 --> 24:11.347
that I wanted to go talk to
Adrian, but I don't know.

24:11.382 --> 24:13.850
I'll see what I can do.

24:15.486 --> 24:18.488
I'll see if the counselor will give
me a note so I can leave at lunch.

24:20.424 --> 24:22.025
See you later.

24:28.265 --> 24:30.600
What's going on?
Do you mind if Amy goes over there?

24:30.868 --> 24:32.368
No, I don't mind.

24:32.403 --> 24:34.404
I just don't want her going over
there and talking about us.

24:34.438 --> 24:35.605
Amy and me.

24:35.673 --> 24:39.809
I know what you're thinking
and don't be ridiculous, okay?

24:40.678 --> 24:42.412
Adrian does not
care about you anymore.

24:43.180 --> 24:44.747
I'm sure she doesn't.

24:45.850 --> 24:47.150
Ben, wait. Let's talk.

24:47.184 --> 24:48.685
I don't want to talk!

24:48.719 --> 24:50.286
I've had a bad morning.

24:50.321 --> 24:52.722
For the past eight weeks, I've had a
bad morning followed by a bad night.

24:52.756 --> 24:55.458
I can't talk any more today, okay?
Just leave me alone.

25:00.030 --> 25:01.531
She would have been
eight weeks old today.

25:01.565 --> 25:03.166
I'm sorry, Ben.

25:04.468 --> 25:06.302
It sucks.
Well put.

25:07.838 --> 25:10.640
It does suck.
Life sucks.

25:11.742 --> 25:13.243
Just not for you and Amy.

25:31.231 --> 25:34.166
Good afternoon. How'd your meeting
with the new inspector go?

25:34.200 --> 25:37.302
Well, he looks 12, and thanks but
I don't need any more coffee.

25:38.071 --> 25:41.206
I had to drink plenty just to
stay awake listening to that guy.

25:41.808 --> 25:43.942
He tweets.
He thinks I should tweet.

25:43.977 --> 25:45.410
You definitely shouldn't.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.346
How's Ben?
Did you talk to Ben today?

25:47.380 --> 25:50.716
Every day. He's doing okay,
Adrian not so much.

25:51.284 --> 25:52.884
They had a rough morning.

25:52.919 --> 25:54.386
The baby would have been
eight weeks old today.

25:55.655 --> 25:56.855
It's not that
I'm keeping track.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.724
I mean,
Ben is and Adrian.

25:58.758 --> 26:01.560
I don't think that's a good
idea, but what do I know?

26:02.729 --> 26:04.963
And how are you?
I'm fine, thanks.

26:06.432 --> 26:08.066
But I want to talk
to you about something.

26:08.101 --> 26:10.302
What's that?
Well, it's something personal.

26:10.336 --> 26:11.637
Let's talk
in your office.

26:13.406 --> 26:15.607
Something personal
like what?

26:17.176 --> 26:18.644
Security cameras.

26:18.678 --> 26:21.044
Yeah, so? Who's listening
besides, uh, me

26:21.069 --> 26:22.269
and the guys who work for me?

26:22.482 --> 26:24.616
All right. Well, um,

26:25.451 --> 26:28.320
I just,
I want you to know that

26:29.188 --> 26:30.489
I'm looking
for another job.

26:30.523 --> 26:32.758
That's not personal,
that's business.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.293
Why would you be
looking for another job?

26:34.327 --> 26:35.594
I just think
it would be best.

26:35.628 --> 26:38.530
Best for who?
That wouldn't be best for me.

26:38.564 --> 26:40.265
Why would you
leave your job?

26:40.300 --> 26:42.100
Do you want a raise?
No.

26:42.135 --> 26:43.969
I just gave you a raise.

26:44.003 --> 26:46.371
Or I could give
you another raise.

26:46.406 --> 26:47.739
Or a promotion.

26:47.774 --> 26:50.342
Well, not a promotion,
I want you right here,

26:50.376 --> 26:52.744
but we could call you a vice
president or something.

26:52.779 --> 26:54.046
I mean,
what do you want?

26:54.080 --> 26:55.714
Leo, I don't want
another raise

26:55.748 --> 26:57.382
or to become
vice president or something.

26:57.417 --> 27:00.285
I just, I don't know.

27:00.320 --> 27:04.089
I've thought seriously about this
and I think I need a change.

27:04.123 --> 27:05.324
Since when?

27:05.358 --> 27:07.559
Since when do you think
you need to make the change?

27:07.593 --> 27:10.429
Look, your wife's home, and
she can take care of you now.

27:10.463 --> 27:11.730
More like
I'll take care of her.

27:11.764 --> 27:14.166
But that has nothing
to do with anything.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.168
I thought things
were going fine here.

27:16.202 --> 27:18.437
I mean, after all we've been
through the last few months,

27:18.471 --> 27:19.671
you'd think of leaving?

27:20.573 --> 27:24.009
And never mind the past few months,
what about the past 25 years?

27:24.043 --> 27:27.112
Yeah, well, um, about
the past 25 years...

27:28.915 --> 27:30.115
I...

27:33.219 --> 27:35.654
I just think it's time to
make a change in my life.

27:35.688 --> 27:36.988
That's all.

27:37.023 --> 27:39.791
I'm sorry to hit you with this
as soon as you walked in,

27:39.826 --> 27:41.159
but I'd have lost my
nerve if I had waited.

27:41.194 --> 27:42.694
You should have waited.

27:42.729 --> 27:45.097
You know what
our policy is here.

27:45.131 --> 27:46.998
If you're looking for a job,
you're looking from home.

27:47.033 --> 27:49.101
Leo, it's your company.
You set the policies.

27:49.135 --> 27:50.502
Yes, I do.
For a reason.

27:50.536 --> 27:52.437
I'm not going to reveal
any of your trade secrets

27:52.472 --> 27:54.873
or personal secrets or
anything else to anyone.

27:54.907 --> 27:56.007
You know me
better than that.

27:56.042 --> 27:58.176
Well, I thought I did,
but I guess not.

27:58.211 --> 27:59.811
If you wanna leave, leave.

27:59.846 --> 28:02.280
Leo, you're just angry.
All right.

28:02.315 --> 28:03.849
Just take some time
to think about this.

28:03.883 --> 28:05.484
I've been thinking
about this for weeks,

28:05.518 --> 28:07.352
and it wasn't easy
to come to this decision.

28:07.387 --> 28:09.488
Yeah. Goodbye, Camille.

28:09.822 --> 28:12.591
Fine. You want me to call the guy to
have the locks changed before I leave?

28:12.625 --> 28:14.726
No, you've done enough.
You could go.

28:14.761 --> 28:15.961
Leo.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.230
I'm not good at goodbyes.
You know that.

28:26.539 --> 28:28.540
<i>Did you talk to her?</i>
<i>No.</i>

28:30.243 --> 28:31.676
<i>She's gonna marry Jake.</i>

28:31.711 --> 28:33.545
<i>He promised me</i>
<i>he would wait.</i>

28:33.579 --> 28:35.280
<i>Promises, promises.</i>

28:36.716 --> 28:40.485
Adrian!
Adrian, it's me.

28:52.432 --> 28:53.932
Adrian, it's me.

28:53.966 --> 28:55.167
It's Amy.

28:57.003 --> 28:58.737
I don't have
a lot of time.

29:01.174 --> 29:02.707
Adrian, hi.

29:03.276 --> 29:04.509
Thanks for letting me
come by.

29:04.544 --> 29:06.678
I didn't let you,
you just came over here.

29:06.946 --> 29:08.613
Oh, I didn't know
if you got my text.

29:08.648 --> 29:09.915
Yeah, I did.

29:09.949 --> 29:11.283
Can I come in?

29:20.126 --> 29:21.993
Want something to eat?

29:22.028 --> 29:23.562
No, I'm okay.

29:24.797 --> 29:27.299
Yeah, you probably
don't need food.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.534
Me? I need
food right now.

29:30.269 --> 29:31.503
And lots of it.

29:34.140 --> 29:35.540
Okay, well,

29:35.575 --> 29:39.878
I mean,
maybe, I could, uh,

29:41.414 --> 29:44.249
join you for...

29:45.885 --> 29:47.185
Churro?

29:47.620 --> 29:51.790
Yeah, okay. I, uh,
could eat a churro.

29:59.165 --> 30:01.099
Hey, have you
heard from Grace?

30:01.634 --> 30:02.868
Yeah, I've heard from her.

30:02.902 --> 30:05.237
She's really enjoying
her trip over there...

30:07.740 --> 30:09.574
We all miss you
in school.

30:11.277 --> 30:12.844
No, we do.

30:12.879 --> 30:14.145
Everyone always
asks about you.

30:14.647 --> 30:15.947
Everyone like who?

30:16.816 --> 30:19.317
Everyone like
all your friends.

30:19.352 --> 30:20.886
What friends?
Well, your friends.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.622
You know you have friends.
All the girls who...

30:24.557 --> 30:25.724
Came to the baby shower?

30:26.659 --> 30:28.393
I'm sorry.

30:28.427 --> 30:30.595
I don't
want to see them.

30:31.931 --> 30:34.566
Yeah. Okay, I...
I guess not.

30:38.571 --> 30:40.572
Have you talked
to the counselor?

30:40.606 --> 30:42.774
Do you want to try
and finish the year?

30:42.808 --> 30:45.277
Could I bring your
books home to you?

30:45.311 --> 30:47.212
Or, um, get your
assignments for you?

30:47.246 --> 30:49.381
No. I don't feel
like doing school work.

30:49.448 --> 30:50.849
I don't care about
school right now.

30:51.417 --> 30:52.751
Understandable.

30:54.954 --> 30:56.388
I mean,

30:56.422 --> 30:59.457
I don't know what it feels
like to be in your situation,

31:00.226 --> 31:02.060
but I know it must be
really tough, Adrian.

31:03.563 --> 31:05.564
Yeah, it is.

31:08.234 --> 31:09.501
I'm sorry.

31:09.535 --> 31:10.902
Let's change the subject.

31:11.637 --> 31:12.904
All right.

31:15.808 --> 31:17.742
You can talk to me
about Ricky.

31:17.777 --> 31:20.512
You know, it's not
going to bother me.

31:21.347 --> 31:23.081
I wasn't avoiding
talking about Ricky.

31:23.115 --> 31:25.717
I just, I didn't know
what to say about Ricky

31:25.751 --> 31:27.686
or Ricky and me.

31:28.521 --> 31:30.121
You can say
anything you want.

31:31.457 --> 31:34.626
Amy, I love Ben.

31:36.529 --> 31:38.129
I really love him.

31:39.966 --> 31:41.933
And he loves me.

31:41.968 --> 31:45.570
I mean, I can't believe he's
still here after what happened.

31:46.839 --> 31:49.741
I mean, he obviously
doesn't have to be here.

31:51.611 --> 31:54.813
The only good thing that's
come out of losing Mercy

31:55.781 --> 31:59.184
is that I know I can count on
Ben for the rest of my life.

32:00.653 --> 32:01.886
I didn't know her name.

32:03.089 --> 32:04.222
Yeah.

32:08.394 --> 32:10.562
If we're going
to be friends, Amy,

32:11.430 --> 32:13.098
we're going to have to
be honest with each other.

32:14.634 --> 32:18.703
So, I've been
honest with you,

32:18.738 --> 32:20.605
you be honest with me.

32:21.340 --> 32:23.608
How are things
with Ricky, really?

32:23.643 --> 32:25.143
Has the sex
changed anything?

32:26.712 --> 32:28.580
I don't know. Maybe.

32:28.614 --> 32:29.714
Maybe how?

32:29.749 --> 32:31.416
I don't know, um...

32:35.187 --> 32:37.422
I'm just, I'm happy.

32:38.824 --> 32:41.026
Maybe for the first
time in my life.

32:42.428 --> 32:45.563
I'm just, I'm really
happy being with Ricky

32:46.766 --> 32:49.134
and staying at his
apartment with John,

32:50.102 --> 32:52.237
and I've been doing
that a lot lately.

32:54.240 --> 32:56.608
So...
That's good.

32:57.009 --> 32:58.376
Uh-huh, yeah.

33:00.646 --> 33:01.946
So,

33:04.083 --> 33:06.151
we decided
we'd just move in together.

33:06.185 --> 33:08.586
Now?
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

33:08.621 --> 33:11.322
We were going to wait until
summer, but we decided not to.

33:11.357 --> 33:12.624
Why's that? Why now?

33:12.658 --> 33:14.259
We just want to.

33:17.396 --> 33:18.730
Well, good for you.

33:19.765 --> 33:20.932
And thanks for telling me.

33:23.536 --> 33:25.670
Now this conversation
feels real.

33:25.705 --> 33:28.006
Not like you're tiptoeing around
my feelings or something.

33:30.443 --> 33:31.943
I'm really sick of that.

33:33.512 --> 33:34.612
Thanks, Amy.

33:41.487 --> 33:43.154
If you think having
Amy move in with you

33:43.189 --> 33:46.858
is going to keep you from doing something
stupid in the future with Adrian,

33:46.892 --> 33:49.194
or any other woman,
you're wrong.

33:49.228 --> 33:52.530
Only you can keep you
from doing something stupid.

33:52.565 --> 33:54.099
Is that why
you're doing this?

33:54.133 --> 33:57.035
Is that why you want Amy and
John to move in with you?

33:57.069 --> 33:58.803
As some kind of
anti-cheat insurance?

33:58.838 --> 34:00.238
No.

34:00.272 --> 34:01.873
Do you still have
feelings for Adrian?

34:01.907 --> 34:04.109
Not those
kind of feelings.

34:04.143 --> 34:06.010
I don't want to
have sex with her.

34:06.779 --> 34:10.815
But I can't help
but feel sorry for her.

34:11.951 --> 34:13.717
Feeling sorry for her
is dangerous.

34:13.753 --> 34:15.286
Why's that?

34:15.321 --> 34:18.022
Because it could lead to saying something
stupid or doing something stupid.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.623
You're not going to do
something stupid.

34:19.658 --> 34:20.725
I hope not.

34:20.760 --> 34:22.694
You hope not? Hope?

34:24.563 --> 34:26.598
I know you can make
this relationship work

34:26.632 --> 34:29.601
because you made up
your mind that it will work.

34:29.635 --> 34:32.070
And that's what it takes,
making up your mind.

34:32.103 --> 34:35.340
At least, I thought
your mind was made up.

34:35.373 --> 34:38.810
No, it is.

34:38.844 --> 34:41.880
That is what I want, and I
have made up my mind, but...

34:41.914 --> 34:43.481
But nothing.

34:44.449 --> 34:48.085
Ricky, love changes people.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.889
Having
a monogamous relationship

34:50.956 --> 34:53.123
may always be
a challenge for you,

34:53.159 --> 34:55.393
but you love Amy,
you love John,

34:55.427 --> 34:57.462
and you are surrounded
by people who love you.

34:57.496 --> 35:00.198
Yeah, but Adrian isn't.

35:01.634 --> 35:03.668
Sooner or later,
Ben is gonna leave her.

35:03.702 --> 35:05.937
I can't share information
about other clients with you.

35:05.971 --> 35:07.272
You know that.

35:07.907 --> 35:09.040
I think you just did.

35:24.832 --> 35:25.565
Hi.

35:26.302 --> 35:27.409
I was in
the neighborhood.

35:27.410 --> 35:29.259
I ought I'd drop by
and see if you'd like

35:29.260 --> 35:32.133
to grab a cup of coffee
or get a bite to eat?

35:32.482 --> 35:34.950
I don't like to have
disagreements over food.

35:35.618 --> 35:37.019
Food is really expensive
and a luxury.

35:37.854 --> 35:40.989
So, when I eat,
I just like to eat.

35:41.758 --> 35:43.191
So, no, thank you.

35:43.226 --> 35:45.193
Hmm. Well, I don't
have your phone number.

35:45.828 --> 35:48.230
I had heard Tom say
that you work here.

35:48.731 --> 35:50.098
Yeah, it's the only job
I could get right now.

35:50.933 --> 35:53.502
It's a thrift shop
run by my church.

35:54.003 --> 35:55.736
Oh, well, that's nice.

35:55.738 --> 35:58.140
That your church is helping
you out with a job,

35:58.574 --> 36:00.108
any job, right?

36:00.743 --> 36:02.009
What else would
you rather be doing?

36:02.078 --> 36:04.313
Just about anything other
than talking to you,

36:04.814 --> 36:05.814
to tell you the truth.

36:05.982 --> 36:07.115
I like that.

36:07.150 --> 36:08.317
The truth.

36:09.485 --> 36:10.585
I can deal
with the truth.

36:11.621 --> 36:13.822
I just can't deal with
not knowing the truth.

36:15.892 --> 36:17.224
Now, there must be
some reason

36:17.260 --> 36:20.128
why you would want to be involved
with a man with limitations.

36:20.496 --> 36:21.930
Limitations.

36:22.498 --> 36:23.718
I see.

36:23.800 --> 36:27.969
You know, Tom's heart doesn't
have any limitations.

36:29.672 --> 36:32.441
I know he really cares
about me and my children,

36:32.975 --> 36:34.676
and I know
I can trust him.

36:35.311 --> 36:38.080
And he's funny
and he's sweet.

36:39.315 --> 36:42.417
Ugh, okay, look,
I might as well tell you.

36:43.519 --> 36:46.321
Surprised Tom didn't and
eventually someone's going to.

36:46.689 --> 36:47.788
Hmm.

36:47.890 --> 36:53.962
I divorced my husband
because he beat me up.

36:55.231 --> 36:59.401
Really beat me up.
In front of the children.

37:00.737 --> 37:04.806
He completely
humiliated me,

37:05.641 --> 37:07.409
and he terrified them.

37:07.877 --> 37:12.147
And then he took them and he put
them in a car and drove away.

37:14.050 --> 37:17.285
It took me three
months to find them.

37:19.122 --> 37:23.592
He went to prison and during all
of this, I lost everything.

37:24.627 --> 37:26.928
I spent everything
I had trying to find them.

37:28.898 --> 37:30.799
Tom is the first guy

37:31.934 --> 37:34.669
that they've been comfortable
around since that happened.

37:36.139 --> 37:39.408
Tom makes me laugh.

37:40.243 --> 37:41.977
And he makes me happy.

37:42.512 --> 37:44.513
And, yes, I can see that
he has Down's syndrome

37:45.081 --> 37:46.748
and so can
the children.

37:47.517 --> 37:48.884
It's just,

37:49.619 --> 37:51.620
we see so much more
than that.

37:54.223 --> 37:55.690
Oh,

37:56.893 --> 37:57.959
this used to be mine.

37:58.394 --> 37:59.795
I gave it away.

38:01.898 --> 38:04.299
But I have a job.
I can buy it back.

38:04.834 --> 38:06.601
Hmm.

38:07.437 --> 38:09.805
Right. I'm so sorry.
I need to get this.

38:11.140 --> 38:12.707
Oh, it's Grace.

38:14.377 --> 38:15.944
Hi, sweetie.

38:16.345 --> 38:19.347
Oh, actually, I'm here with
Rachel, Tom's girlfriend.

38:20.516 --> 38:22.484
We were just discussing her
moving into the guest house.

38:25.488 --> 38:26.655
So, did you see her?

38:26.989 --> 38:28.390
Um, yeah.

38:29.692 --> 38:31.059
I saw her.
She let me in.

38:31.661 --> 38:35.497
We talked,
it was okay.

38:36.032 --> 38:38.533
I don't really know if I helped her
or cheered her up or anything.

38:39.168 --> 38:40.435
She seems to
be kind of sad,

38:41.537 --> 38:43.939
and I hadn't really
picked this up in her texts,

38:44.907 --> 38:48.310
but I guess she's also
justifiably kind of angry.

38:48.578 --> 38:50.731
Yeah. I know.
Are you okay?

38:50.613 --> 38:52.344
Me? Yeah, sure. I'm fine.

38:52.421 --> 38:53.457
Was the place a mess?

38:53.482 --> 38:55.212
I mean, it's a mess
when I get home every night,

38:55.218 --> 38:56.517
but I left it clean
this morning.

38:56.586 --> 38:57.953
Ben, none of that stuff
matters right now.

38:58.688 --> 39:00.473
It just doesn't
matter that...

39:00.490 --> 39:02.290
That there was food
all over the place.

39:03.359 --> 39:04.559
I should have warned you.

39:05.561 --> 39:07.696
She's not really taking
care of things, right now.

39:08.297 --> 39:10.432
Not just things, herself.

39:11.267 --> 39:12.701
She's kind of a mess.

39:13.503 --> 39:15.737
She... I just...
I feel so badly for her.

39:17.306 --> 39:19.474
I love her, Amy,

39:20.343 --> 39:21.743
and I know I said
something to you one day

39:22.512 --> 39:24.346
about not wanting
to be married

39:25.047 --> 39:26.631
and not wanting
to be a father but...

39:26.649 --> 39:28.884
I just, I wish
I could take it all back.

39:30.786 --> 39:32.888
I feel that somehow

39:33.789 --> 39:35.824
life betrayed her

39:37.026 --> 39:38.326
because I betrayed her
by saying what I said,

39:39.195 --> 39:42.230
and I just want you
to know that, that...

39:43.933 --> 39:45.200
I want
to take it all back.

39:46.068 --> 39:47.569
Ben, come on.
You did not betray her.

39:48.538 --> 39:50.487
In that single moment
in time, you were scared.

39:50.561 --> 39:52.919
And that doesn't mean that you
really felt that way, all the time.

39:54.203 --> 39:56.468
But even if you did,
having a baby

39:55.478 --> 39:58.014
and getting married
in high school is scary.

39:58.014 --> 40:01.282
Not as scary as holding your
stillborn daughter in your arms.

40:03.786 --> 40:06.721
Hey, it wasn't your fault.
It wasn't.

40:07.924 --> 40:09.505
It wasn't because
you said anything wrong

40:09.592 --> 40:11.693
or did anything wrong,
you know that.

40:19.368 --> 40:21.670
You really are
having a bad day, huh?

40:22.271 --> 40:23.505
Yeah.

40:29.378 --> 40:30.679
He is.

40:31.147 --> 40:32.681
Having a bad day.

40:34.917 --> 40:38.486
I think everyone
is staring at us.

40:39.789 --> 40:41.089
Yeah. I think they are.

40:41.524 --> 40:42.723
What should we do?

40:42.792 --> 40:44.159
I think
we should get used to it.

40:45.428 --> 40:48.663
Everyone is going to be watching
every move the four of us make.

40:51.534 --> 40:53.134
See you at home.

41:11.654 --> 41:12.920
How's that Chianti?

41:12.955 --> 41:14.388
I like a good Chianti.

41:14.523 --> 41:16.024
Especially with
a nice steak like that.

41:17.727 --> 41:18.995
That's your
second bottle.

41:19.161 --> 41:21.596
Well, the first bottle
I shared with Betty.

41:22.064 --> 41:24.299
I just felt like
having another drink.

41:24.667 --> 41:25.909
I'm a big guy.

41:25.968 --> 41:28.503
I could drink a lot
of wine before I feel it.

41:29.972 --> 41:31.763
I wouldn't mind
drinking a little myself.

41:31.807 --> 41:34.609
You know, I don't believe in that.
In underage kids drinking

41:35.311 --> 41:36.577
so they can
get used to it,

41:36.579 --> 41:37.679
and become better
drinkers or something

41:38.381 --> 41:39.614
when they can
legally drink.

41:39.682 --> 41:41.416
Yeah, I know. I just

41:42.818 --> 41:44.085
don't feel like going home.

41:44.654 --> 41:46.655
Well, you have to go home.

41:48.591 --> 41:49.924
And I have
to go upstairs.

41:50.893 --> 41:52.761
You don't want to go upstairs
and be with Betty?

41:53.996 --> 41:56.597
I don't believe in discussing
my wife with my son either.

41:56.599 --> 41:57.899
I'm your grown son.

41:59.535 --> 42:00.734
And after the
past few months,

42:00.803 --> 42:04.606
I thought we could discuss anything.
I'm sorry.

42:06.375 --> 42:08.743
No. I'm sorry, Ben.
Sit down.

42:19.922 --> 42:21.523
Don't say it out loud.

42:24.460 --> 42:26.061
I don't want to be married.

42:31.534 --> 42:32.667
Me neither.

42:35.938 --> 42:37.605
But we can't do
anything about it.
