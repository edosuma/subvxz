WEBVTT

00:02.586 --> 00:04.045
How was the park?

00:04.087 --> 00:05.213
Oh, it was great.

00:05.255 --> 00:06.674
We had a blast.

00:08.592 --> 00:10.552
Hal.

00:08.592 --> 00:10.552
I know,

00:08.592 --> 00:10.552
I know, he's filthy.

00:10.594 --> 00:12.680
I decided to let him

00:10.594 --> 00:12.680
out to crawl around

00:12.721 --> 00:14.055
in the dirt for

00:12.721 --> 00:14.055
a little while,

00:14.097 --> 00:15.223
he had so much fun

00:15.265 --> 00:16.308
rolling around

00:15.265 --> 00:16.308
with the other kids.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.351
Lois, you should have seen him.

00:17.392 --> 00:19.060
Hal...

00:17.392 --> 00:19.060
Lois, you can't

00:19.102 --> 00:20.688
treat the boy like

00:19.102 --> 00:20.688
he's made of glass.

00:20.729 --> 00:22.439
He'll be fine.

00:20.729 --> 00:22.439
We can clean him up.

00:22.481 --> 00:24.942
The important thing is that

00:22.481 --> 00:24.942
Jamie and I had fun together.

00:24.984 --> 00:27.611
This isn't Jamie.

00:29.112 --> 00:32.032
Huh.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.076
I know exactly who

00:33.116 --> 00:35.076
I switched him with.

00:35.118 --> 00:36.662
Hi there.

00:36.704 --> 00:39.915
♪ Life is unfair. ♪

00:45.128 --> 00:46.087
Boys, Aunt Susan

00:46.129 --> 00:47.088
will be here

00:46.129 --> 00:47.088
any minute.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.591
I thought I told you

00:47.130 --> 00:49.591
to clean up the kitchen.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.552
You heard your mother,

00:49.633 --> 00:51.552
do it again.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.094
No, no, no. Wait.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.388
No one's

00:53.136 --> 00:54.388
cleaning up.

00:54.429 --> 00:56.015
If Susan can't accept

00:54.429 --> 00:56.015
how we live,

00:56.056 --> 00:57.599
she can just get back

00:56.056 --> 00:57.599
on her high horse

00:57.641 --> 01:00.060
and ride off to that sterile

00:57.641 --> 01:00.060
tomb she calls a home.

01:01.937 --> 01:04.398
Why is Mom always so

01:01.937 --> 01:04.398
weird about Aunt Susan?

01:04.439 --> 01:06.817
Dad used to be

01:04.439 --> 01:06.817
Aunt Susan's boyfriend...

01:06.859 --> 01:08.109
until Mom stole him.

01:08.151 --> 01:08.986
But we

01:08.151 --> 01:08.986
don't know

01:09.028 --> 01:10.362
anything about it.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.697
We also think Francis

01:11.739 --> 01:13.032
is a year younger

01:11.739 --> 01:13.032
than he really is.

01:13.073 --> 01:13.949
Got it.

01:13.073 --> 01:13.949
(horn honks)

01:13.991 --> 01:15.075
There she is.

01:15.826 --> 01:17.118
Sweet.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.538
She brought the Mustang!

01:17.160 --> 01:19.538
Oh, man.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.122
Well, when you hang

01:19.580 --> 01:21.122
on to every penny

01:21.164 --> 01:22.207
until it screams

01:21.164 --> 01:22.207
bloody murder,

01:22.249 --> 01:23.751
you can afford

01:22.249 --> 01:23.751
nice things.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.293
I wish your father

01:23.792 --> 01:25.293
and I were better

01:25.335 --> 01:27.128
about that instead of

01:25.335 --> 01:27.128
frittering our money away

01:27.170 --> 01:29.088
on all the little

01:27.170 --> 01:29.088
extras for you boys.

01:30.173 --> 01:31.132
Susan!

01:31.174 --> 01:33.301
I'm so happy to see you!

01:33.343 --> 01:35.971
And I don't want you to worry

01:33.343 --> 01:35.971
about your last phone call.

01:36.013 --> 01:37.556
I've completely forgiven you.

01:37.598 --> 01:38.933
It's good

01:37.598 --> 01:38.933
to see you, too.

01:38.974 --> 01:40.559
I guess the drive took

01:38.974 --> 01:40.559
a little longer

01:40.601 --> 01:42.061
than expected?

01:42.101 --> 01:43.437
Well, lunch

01:42.101 --> 01:43.437
will taste fine cold.

01:43.478 --> 01:44.521
Hi.

01:43.478 --> 01:44.521
Hi, Aunt Susan.

01:43.478 --> 01:44.521
Hello.

01:44.563 --> 01:46.815
Listen to the deep voices.

01:46.857 --> 01:48.442
Unbelievable, Lois.

01:48.483 --> 01:49.777
They're almost grown

01:49.818 --> 01:51.028
and you're still

01:49.818 --> 01:51.028
popping them out.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.739
And this must be Jamie.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.074
Hello, sweetie.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.408
Hello, cutie pie.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.158
Hi, Susan.

01:57.200 --> 01:58.159
Hal.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.160
Look at you.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.579
You're such

01:59.202 --> 02:00.579
a sweetie pie.

02:00.621 --> 02:02.372
Uh, boys,

02:00.621 --> 02:02.372
why don't you go get

02:02.414 --> 02:04.875
Aunt Susan's bags out

02:02.414 --> 02:04.875
of her fancy car?

02:04.917 --> 02:07.252
That car

02:04.917 --> 02:07.252
is outrageous.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.379
Well, sometimes you just

02:07.294 --> 02:09.379
have to treat yourself.

02:09.421 --> 02:10.965
Oh, and I brought

02:11.006 --> 02:12.591
a gift for Jamie.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.593
Wow.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.593
Susan, thank you.

02:14.635 --> 02:17.554
After six months of shopping,

02:14.635 --> 02:17.554
this must be quite a card.

02:17.596 --> 02:19.681
Oh, it's not the card,

02:17.596 --> 02:19.681
it's what's inside.

02:19.723 --> 02:21.433
It's a $5,000

02:19.723 --> 02:21.433
savings bond.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.812
Well, I don't know

02:23.477 --> 02:24.812
what to say.

02:24.853 --> 02:25.896
It's going to mature

02:25.938 --> 02:27.106
right around the time

02:27.147 --> 02:28.816
he's ready to go off to college.

02:28.857 --> 02:30.943
Someone should be

02:28.857 --> 02:30.943
thinking of that.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.823
Okay, girls,

02:33.487 --> 02:35.823
this is the wildest,

02:35.864 --> 02:38.199
most remote area

02:35.864 --> 02:38.199
on the entire ranch.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.200
You think

02:38.241 --> 02:39.200
we can handle

02:39.242 --> 02:40.786
a whole weekend out here?

02:40.828 --> 02:43.455
Brittany and Ashley

02:40.828 --> 02:43.455
want to marry you.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.457
No, no,

02:45.499 --> 02:46.500
you can't do that.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.167
George! George!

02:50.671 --> 02:51.922
I'm sorry,

02:50.671 --> 02:51.922
we have to go back.

02:51.964 --> 02:53.132
My ex-husband

02:53.172 --> 02:54.591
is trying

02:53.172 --> 02:54.591
to have my frozen eggs

02:54.633 --> 02:56.217
fertilized by his boyfriend.

02:56.259 --> 02:57.218
Come on, girls.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.220
(all protesting)

02:59.262 --> 03:02.975
Girls, Buttercups are brave

02:59.262 --> 03:02.975
in the face of disappointment.

03:05.978 --> 03:07.146
You know what?

03:07.186 --> 03:08.856
You take the van back.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.024
I'll watch the girls.

03:10.065 --> 03:11.692
Are you sure

03:10.065 --> 03:11.692
you can handle it?

03:11.733 --> 03:13.234
Absolutely.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.234
This is my backyard.

03:13.276 --> 03:15.863
Besides, look at all

03:13.276 --> 03:15.863
those merit badges.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.239
ALL:

03:15.904 --> 03:18.239
Can we?! Can we?! Can we?!

03:18.281 --> 03:21.242
Well, they have been looking

03:18.281 --> 03:21.242
forward to this for so long.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.536
We'll be fine.

03:22.577 --> 03:24.163
(cheering)

03:24.203 --> 03:26.247
Where are we?

03:26.289 --> 03:27.415
I don't know,

03:26.289 --> 03:27.415
sweetie.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.168
Mr. Mountain Lion

03:27.457 --> 03:29.168
didn't give me

03:29.208 --> 03:30.669
enough time

03:29.208 --> 03:30.669
to grab my compass.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.295
I'm hungry.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.295
Yeah, well,

03:32.337 --> 03:34.297
I'm going to refer you back

03:32.337 --> 03:34.297
to the mountain lion thing.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.508
Where are we

03:34.339 --> 03:36.508
going to sleep?

03:36.550 --> 03:37.718
Girls, please.

03:37.759 --> 03:40.095
We have water,

03:37.759 --> 03:40.095
we'll find shelter

03:40.137 --> 03:41.429
and I know the land.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.306
There's food all around us.

03:43.348 --> 03:46.143
Look-- those are edible

03:43.348 --> 03:46.143
fungi called truffles.

03:46.185 --> 03:48.103
Those are deer turds.

03:49.104 --> 03:50.731
Okay, well, we're all

03:50.772 --> 03:53.274
going to learn

03:50.772 --> 03:53.274
a lot this weekend.

03:53.316 --> 03:56.277
That pasta

03:53.316 --> 03:56.277
was fabulous, Reese.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.738
How's Larry?

03:57.779 --> 03:59.156
He won't stop

03:57.779 --> 03:59.156
fighting with Mom.

03:59.198 --> 04:00.490
The other day she

03:59.198 --> 04:00.490
barged in on him

04:00.532 --> 04:01.909
when he was

04:00.532 --> 04:01.909
in the bathtub.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.451
So he stood up,

04:01.950 --> 04:03.451
yanked off her wig,

04:03.493 --> 04:04.452
and dried

04:03.493 --> 04:04.452
himself with it.

04:04.494 --> 04:05.871
Very thoroughly.

04:05.913 --> 04:06.955
(laughing)

04:06.997 --> 04:08.916
That Larry's a keeper.

04:08.957 --> 04:11.752
Yeah, it's so great he's

04:08.957 --> 04:11.752
not a backstabbing weasel.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.296
A weasel is

04:12.753 --> 04:15.296
a horrible animal.

04:15.338 --> 04:19.009
Susan, I've been thinking

04:15.338 --> 04:19.009
about the gift you gave Jamie.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.220
I know, Lois, and you don't

04:19.051 --> 04:21.220
have to worry about it.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.555
I brought gifts

04:21.261 --> 04:23.555
for the other boys, too.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.723
Yes!

04:24.765 --> 04:26.183
Sitting here

04:24.765 --> 04:26.183
looking interested

04:26.225 --> 04:27.101
finally pays off.

04:27.142 --> 04:28.309
No, Susan,

04:27.142 --> 04:28.309
that's not

04:28.351 --> 04:29.310
what I meant.

04:29.352 --> 04:30.979
I'm uncomfortable

04:29.352 --> 04:30.979
with the amount.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.355
It's awfully extravagant.

04:32.397 --> 04:33.899
Oh, you think

04:32.397 --> 04:33.899
everything's extravagant.

04:33.941 --> 04:37.318
Now, I know how much

04:33.941 --> 04:37.318
little Dewey likes candy,

04:37.360 --> 04:39.196
so I got him

04:37.360 --> 04:39.196
a professional

04:39.238 --> 04:42.241
cotton candy machine.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.411
(gasps)

04:46.453 --> 04:47.913
Susan, what are you doing?

04:47.955 --> 04:49.330
We don't own a circus.

04:49.372 --> 04:50.874
Well, now you can

04:49.372 --> 04:50.874
feel like you do.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.001
Now, I'm sorry,

04:51.833 --> 04:53.001
but you two boys

04:53.043 --> 04:53.794
are going to have

04:53.835 --> 04:55.336
to share a gift.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.338
I'm giving you the Mustang.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.757
Oh, my God!

04:57.380 --> 04:58.757
You're kidding!

04:58.799 --> 04:59.633
REESE:

04:58.799 --> 04:59.633
Thank you!

04:59.674 --> 05:00.717
I never believed

05:00.759 --> 05:02.343
anything Mom

05:00.759 --> 05:02.343
said about you.

05:02.385 --> 05:03.720
Susan, you can't

05:02.385 --> 05:03.720
give them a car.

05:03.762 --> 05:04.972
Mom, technically

05:03.762 --> 05:04.972
this is a transaction

05:05.013 --> 05:06.514
between Aunt Susan and us.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.349
And I'm willing to hire

05:06.556 --> 05:08.349
a lawyer to enforce it.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.227
You want to go there,

05:08.391 --> 05:10.227
I'll go there.

05:11.061 --> 05:12.062
You know, Lois,

05:12.104 --> 05:14.355
usually when someone

05:12.104 --> 05:14.355
gives gifts,

05:14.397 --> 05:15.523
people say thank you.

05:15.565 --> 05:18.860
Well, I'm sorry, this...

05:15.565 --> 05:18.860
sudden generosity,

05:18.902 --> 05:21.613
coming from you,

05:18.902 --> 05:21.613
is a little baffling.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.364
Oh, I'm sorry that the concept

05:23.406 --> 05:25.159
of opening your heart and giving

05:25.200 --> 05:26.952
is so baffling to you.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.369
LOIS:

05:26.994 --> 05:28.369
I don't know,

05:26.994 --> 05:28.369
some people might not

05:28.411 --> 05:29.955
think of it as giving.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.291
Some people might think of it

05:29.997 --> 05:32.291
as just showing off.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.417
Oh, here we go! We're only

05:32.332 --> 05:34.417
three hours in, and we've

05:34.459 --> 05:36.253
already received

05:34.459 --> 05:36.253
our first visit

05:36.295 --> 05:38.213
from the Queen Bee

05:36.295 --> 05:38.213
of Moral Superiority.

05:38.255 --> 05:41.300
Oh, and here's the victim,

05:38.255 --> 05:41.300
right on schedule!

05:41.340 --> 05:43.302
I became the victim

05:41.340 --> 05:43.302
on my prom night

05:43.342 --> 05:45.386
when I walked into

05:43.342 --> 05:45.386
the garage and caught

05:45.428 --> 05:47.555
my boyfriend having sex

05:45.428 --> 05:47.555
with my sister

05:47.597 --> 05:49.266
on the hood of my car!

05:53.020 --> 05:54.855
(whispering):

05:53.020 --> 05:54.855
Where do I look?

05:54.896 --> 05:57.524
There's

05:54.896 --> 05:57.524
nowhere  to  look.

06:01.069 --> 06:03.238
Dad, please, you don't

06:01.069 --> 06:03.238
have to do this.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.405
We love this car.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.699
We promise we

06:04.447 --> 06:05.699
won't try to drive it

06:05.740 --> 06:07.117
until you say we can.

06:07.159 --> 06:09.328
You think your mom and I

06:07.159 --> 06:09.328
were born yesterday?

06:09.368 --> 06:11.496
How can you do this?!

06:13.081 --> 06:14.415
Boys, please.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.084
I know this is hard

06:14.457 --> 06:16.084
for you to understand,

06:16.126 --> 06:17.127
but you're just going

06:17.169 --> 06:18.503
to have

06:17.169 --> 06:18.503
to realize that

06:18.545 --> 06:20.214
your mom and Susan are crazy.

06:20.255 --> 06:22.257
The sooner you learn

06:20.255 --> 06:22.257
to accept that, the better.

06:26.303 --> 06:27.428
Okay, girls,

06:27.470 --> 06:29.139
we got a nice cozy cave

06:27.470 --> 06:29.139
to sleep in,

06:29.181 --> 06:30.307
a big roaring fire...

06:30.349 --> 06:31.933
I'd say things are looking up.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.227
That isn't enough firewood.

06:33.268 --> 06:34.435
You have to keep

06:33.268 --> 06:34.435
the fire going

06:34.477 --> 06:37.105
all night

06:34.477 --> 06:37.105
to keep animals away.

06:37.147 --> 06:41.442
Okay, Meagan, Kirsten,

06:37.147 --> 06:41.442
go get more firewood,

06:41.484 --> 06:45.113
and make sure it's not this dumb

06:41.484 --> 06:45.113
green stuff Francis got.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.532
Whoa, whoa, you girls

06:45.155 --> 06:47.532
aren't going anywhere.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.117
It's dark out there.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.952
I'm in charge here

06:49.159 --> 06:50.952
and I'm telling you to stay.

06:52.329 --> 06:54.248
I vote Brittany

06:52.329 --> 06:54.248
to be our new leader.

06:54.289 --> 06:55.165
All in favor?

06:55.207 --> 06:56.457
ALL:

06:55.207 --> 06:56.457
Aye!

06:56.499 --> 06:57.458
I accept.

06:57.500 --> 06:58.668
Now you guys

06:57.500 --> 06:58.668
get the firewood

06:58.710 --> 07:00.461
and you guys move the blankets

07:00.503 --> 07:02.047
to the dry part

07:00.503 --> 07:02.047
of the cave.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.924
What are you doing?

07:02.089 --> 07:03.924
You can't change the leader.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.175
We voted.

07:05.217 --> 07:06.467
It doesn't matter.

07:06.509 --> 07:09.388
Now I'm the grown-up,

07:06.509 --> 07:09.388
so that puts me in charge.

07:09.428 --> 07:10.638
All you girls,

07:10.680 --> 07:13.433
you sit down, 'cause

07:10.680 --> 07:13.433
no one's going anywhere.

07:14.309 --> 07:16.103
♪ We are the Buttercups ♪

07:16.144 --> 07:18.105
♪ We're true blue ♪

07:18.146 --> 07:22.192
♪ We stick together

07:18.146 --> 07:22.192
just like glue ♪

07:22.234 --> 07:26.405
♪ We never doubt

07:22.234 --> 07:26.405
what we can do ♪

07:26.446 --> 07:30.409
♪ We're honest

07:26.446 --> 07:30.409
through and through. ♪

07:35.747 --> 07:38.458
I'm in charge.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.045
I'm in charge.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.505
This is torture.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.216
The car's just sitting there

07:44.547 --> 07:46.216
and no one can drive it.

07:46.258 --> 07:47.592
Yeah, it's like that hot nun

07:47.634 --> 07:49.928
who comes around

07:47.634 --> 07:49.928
every year for toy drive.

07:49.970 --> 07:50.929
You know what?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.222
We're not going to let

07:52.264 --> 07:54.099
Mom and Dad

07:52.264 --> 07:54.099
get away with this.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.516
Forget it, Reese.

07:55.558 --> 07:57.936
Your bolt cutters

07:55.558 --> 07:57.936
can't handle that lock.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.230
And Dad's bolt cutters

07:57.978 --> 08:00.230
are in the garage.

08:00.272 --> 08:01.815
It doesn't matter.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.608
You don't understand the power

08:01.856 --> 08:03.608
of my brain, Malcolm.

08:03.650 --> 08:07.028
It's like a deep ravine

08:03.650 --> 08:07.028
that sits in total darkness,

08:07.070 --> 08:09.530
but once in a while,

08:07.070 --> 08:09.530
just for a moment,

08:09.572 --> 08:13.368
a brilliant shaft of light

08:09.572 --> 08:13.368
shines directly down into it.

08:13.410 --> 08:16.204
And that is the moment I

08:13.410 --> 08:16.204
will think of a genius plan

08:16.246 --> 08:18.957
that will get us

08:16.246 --> 08:18.957
into that Mustang.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.751
So the only way for us

08:18.999 --> 08:21.751
to get out of this situation

08:21.793 --> 08:23.837
is dependent

08:21.793 --> 08:23.837
on you being a genius?

08:23.878 --> 08:26.506
Correct.

08:36.599 --> 08:40.228
(machine humming)

08:50.030 --> 08:54.242
Everything in my life

08:50.030 --> 08:54.242
has led up to this moment.

08:54.284 --> 08:55.576
So, where's Susan?

08:55.618 --> 08:58.413
She said she was

08:55.618 --> 08:58.413
out shopping,

08:58.455 --> 09:00.374
but I wouldn't be surprised

08:58.455 --> 09:00.374
if she was out right now

09:00.415 --> 09:02.583
renting herself a car so we'd

09:00.415 --> 09:02.583
have to accept her Mustang.

09:02.625 --> 09:03.793
She's fully capable of that.

09:03.835 --> 09:05.586
You know, honey,

09:03.835 --> 09:05.586
you may want to...

09:05.628 --> 09:07.588
Okay, never mind.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.007
(phone rings musically)

09:09.049 --> 09:10.591
Can you

09:09.049 --> 09:10.591
believe it?

09:10.633 --> 09:13.178
Classical music-- how

09:10.633 --> 09:13.178
pretentious is  that?

09:13.220 --> 09:14.804
Well, we're just

09:13.220 --> 09:14.804
going to ignore it.

09:14.846 --> 09:16.597
I'm sure she has

09:14.846 --> 09:16.597
voice mail, so we'll just...

09:16.639 --> 09:17.807
LOIS:

09:16.639 --> 09:17.807
Hello?

09:17.849 --> 09:19.476
Hi, Susan, this is Dr. Dumont.

09:19.518 --> 09:21.395
This isn't Susan.

09:19.518 --> 09:21.395
This is her sister.

09:21.436 --> 09:22.521
Excuse me?

09:22.562 --> 09:23.604
This is her sister, Lois.

09:23.646 --> 09:24.814
We just sound a lot alike.

09:24.856 --> 09:26.607
You're Susan's sister?!

09:26.649 --> 09:28.068
Yes.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.194
Her birth sister?!

09:29.236 --> 09:31.612
Yes. What's the problem?

09:31.654 --> 09:33.614
The problem is you should

09:31.654 --> 09:33.614
have been in here

09:33.656 --> 09:35.075
six months ago

09:33.656 --> 09:35.075
for a blood test.

09:35.116 --> 09:37.869
Why? What's going on here?

09:35.116 --> 09:37.869
What's wrong with Susan?

09:37.911 --> 09:41.206
Your sister has

09:37.911 --> 09:41.206
end-stage renal disease.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.290
If she doesn't get

09:42.332 --> 09:43.624
a donor kidney soon,

09:43.666 --> 09:45.043
she's going to die.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.127
And she told me

09:46.169 --> 09:47.587
she was an only child.

10:02.477 --> 10:03.437
Good news, girls.

10:03.478 --> 10:04.854
It took me all day,

10:04.896 --> 10:06.647
but I caught

10:04.896 --> 10:06.647
two delicious-looking lizards

10:06.689 --> 10:09.484
and the back half of what

10:06.689 --> 10:09.484
I'm pretty sure is a gopher.

10:09.526 --> 10:13.321
Meagan and Ashley built a trap

10:09.526 --> 10:13.321
and caught some rabbits.

10:13.363 --> 10:14.489
What's in the pot?

10:14.531 --> 10:15.740
We found some roots

10:14.531 --> 10:15.740
and grasses

10:15.782 --> 10:17.284
to make soup with.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.869
And we're not putting in

10:17.325 --> 10:19.869
your gross lizards.

10:19.911 --> 10:20.912
Yeah.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.539
You can't eat that soup.

10:22.581 --> 10:23.664
There's no way to know

10:23.706 --> 10:25.292
if what you gathered

10:23.706 --> 10:25.292
is safe to eat.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.544
But we only picked things

10:25.333 --> 10:27.544
we saw the bunnies eating.

10:27.586 --> 10:29.129
I'm sorry, it's too risky.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.671
What are you doing?

10:30.713 --> 10:32.466
I'm going

10:30.713 --> 10:32.466
to dump out the soup.

10:32.507 --> 10:36.136
No, you're not.

10:32.507 --> 10:36.136
It's  our  soup.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.846
Okay, we've played

10:36.177 --> 10:38.846
this game long enough.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.516
I am in charge!

10:38.888 --> 10:41.516
I am an adult!

10:41.558 --> 10:43.893
And I also happen to be

10:41.558 --> 10:43.893
much bigger and stronger

10:43.935 --> 10:45.270
than you girls.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.729
So if this is the way

10:45.312 --> 10:46.729
you want to play this,

10:46.771 --> 10:47.855
that's fine, but I...

10:47.897 --> 10:49.774
ALL:

10:47.897 --> 10:49.774
Get him! Get him! Get him!

10:49.816 --> 10:51.151
(clamoring)

10:51.192 --> 10:53.694
You are on thin ice, girls!

10:53.736 --> 10:57.365
One more stunt like this

10:53.736 --> 10:57.365
and I won't be responsible!

10:57.407 --> 10:59.493
I am serious!

10:59.534 --> 11:01.495
Look at you.

11:01.536 --> 11:02.912
Now you're a sleeping sailor.

11:02.954 --> 11:05.373
He can try on the rest

11:02.954 --> 11:05.373
of his new outfits later.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.669
You know, I really missed

11:07.167 --> 11:09.669
the boat not having kids.

11:10.753 --> 11:13.047
I got to admit, I envy you.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.091
Is that why

11:15.133 --> 11:17.010
you're not taking my kidney?

11:15.133 --> 11:17.010
What?

11:17.051 --> 11:20.180
Your cell phone rang

11:17.051 --> 11:20.180
this morning. I answered it.

11:20.221 --> 11:23.975
It was your doctor, Susan.

11:20.221 --> 11:23.975
He told me everything.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.727
How could you tell him

11:24.017 --> 11:26.727
that I don't exist?

11:26.769 --> 11:28.605
How can you not even

11:26.769 --> 11:28.605
ask me for a kidney

11:28.647 --> 11:30.023
when I'm probably

11:28.647 --> 11:30.023
a perfect match?

11:30.064 --> 11:32.651
What kind of weird

11:30.064 --> 11:32.651
psychological issues

11:32.691 --> 11:34.027
are making you do this?

11:34.068 --> 11:37.030
Who gave you the right

11:34.068 --> 11:37.030
to answer my cell phone?!

11:37.071 --> 11:39.157
What is wrong with you?

11:39.199 --> 11:42.118
If I give you one of my kidneys,

11:39.199 --> 11:42.118
you can live.

11:42.160 --> 11:44.745
Well, that's the moment we've

11:42.160 --> 11:44.745
all been waiting for, isn't it?

11:44.787 --> 11:48.916
The almighty Lois now has

11:44.787 --> 11:48.916
the power to grant me life!

11:48.958 --> 11:50.751
Don't mind me. Not staying.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.751
Just getting an innocent

11:50.793 --> 11:52.253
child out of the line of fire.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.253
Enjoy your chat.

11:52.295 --> 11:53.754
See? We're already gone.

11:52.295 --> 11:53.754
Good-bye.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.632
Why do you always twist

11:53.796 --> 11:55.632
around everything I say

11:55.674 --> 11:57.384
to make it seem

11:55.674 --> 11:57.384
like I'm attacking you?

11:57.425 --> 11:58.593
Why do you always

11:57.425 --> 11:58.593
say "always"?

11:58.635 --> 11:59.594
Do you have any idea

11:58.635 --> 11:59.594
how stupid

11:59.636 --> 12:00.761
that makes you sound?!

12:00.803 --> 12:02.013
Don't change the subject!

12:02.055 --> 12:04.683
My God, this is the apple

12:02.055 --> 12:04.683
turnover all over again.

12:04.723 --> 12:08.895
Don't you dare bring up

12:04.723 --> 12:08.895
the apple turnover!

12:09.854 --> 12:11.772
Oh, screw it.

12:11.814 --> 12:14.067
I've had 15 years of therapy.

12:11.814 --> 12:14.067
I'm better than this.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.236
I'm talking to you!

12:16.277 --> 12:18.321
I am not your puppet!

12:19.322 --> 12:23.410
(quiet tapping)

12:24.827 --> 12:25.953
What?

12:25.995 --> 12:27.955
I know what

12:25.995 --> 12:27.955
I did wrong, Hal.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.208
I let her get away

12:27.997 --> 12:30.208
too easily.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.169
Well, I didn't think anything

12:30.250 --> 12:33.169
was gonna be solved

12:33.211 --> 12:36.256
once you got into who

12:33.211 --> 12:36.256
your goldfish liked better.

12:36.297 --> 12:39.217
You're right. Arguing with

12:36.297 --> 12:39.217
her accomplishes nothing.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.635
That's why I'm going to

12:39.259 --> 12:40.635
have a judge

12:40.677 --> 12:41.802
declare her

12:40.677 --> 12:41.802
mentally incompetent.

12:41.844 --> 12:44.472
That's never going to work,

12:41.844 --> 12:44.472
Lois.

12:44.514 --> 12:45.806
Are you kidding?

12:45.848 --> 12:48.393
Any psychiatrist spends

12:45.848 --> 12:48.393
five minutes with her

12:48.435 --> 12:49.728
would say that she's crazy!

12:49.768 --> 12:51.271
Lois, don't take this

12:49.768 --> 12:51.271
the wrong way,

12:51.312 --> 12:52.855
but when you two get together,

12:52.897 --> 12:54.815
you don't exactly have

12:52.897 --> 12:54.815
the high ground on crazy.

12:54.857 --> 12:56.735
Well, what am I

12:54.857 --> 12:56.735
supposed to do, Hal,

12:56.775 --> 12:58.695
just sit back

12:56.775 --> 12:58.695
and watch her die?

12:58.737 --> 13:00.196
I don't know what to do either.

13:00.238 --> 13:01.698
But Susan is an adult.

13:01.740 --> 13:04.783
You can't force someone

13:01.740 --> 13:04.783
to take a kidney.

13:08.371 --> 13:10.373
Hey.

13:30.101 --> 13:31.436
What do you think

13:30.101 --> 13:31.436
you're doing?!

13:31.478 --> 13:32.853
Savoring the greatest

13:31.478 --> 13:32.853
achievement

13:32.895 --> 13:34.105
of a life that so far

13:34.147 --> 13:35.898
has had some

13:34.147 --> 13:35.898
pretty mixed results.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.066
Get in.

13:37.108 --> 13:38.859
What exactly do you think

13:38.901 --> 13:41.112
you're going to accomplish

13:38.901 --> 13:41.112
in a car with no engine?

13:41.154 --> 13:43.490
There's a kegger

13:41.154 --> 13:43.490
down at the field.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.908
They've been without

13:43.531 --> 13:45.908
us long enough.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.703
Reese, you're insane!

13:48.745 --> 13:51.830
Yeah, you could make

13:48.745 --> 13:51.830
an argument for that.

Huh?

14:19.942 --> 14:21.486
Shh!

14:21.528 --> 14:23.404
I have something

14:21.528 --> 14:23.404
very important to tell you.

14:23.446 --> 14:24.989
What?

14:25.031 --> 14:26.907
Brittany told me

14:25.031 --> 14:26.907
that Donny Frost

14:26.949 --> 14:29.118
said that he likes you,

14:26.949 --> 14:29.118
but she won't tell you

14:29.160 --> 14:31.078
'cause she thinks

14:29.160 --> 14:31.078
you're stuck up.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.913
No way!

14:32.955 --> 14:35.792
And also, she said those shoes

14:32.955 --> 14:35.792
she said were cute on you

14:35.834 --> 14:37.126
aren't cute on you at all.

14:37.168 --> 14:39.086
They're actually dorky.

14:39.128 --> 14:41.506
Why would she say

14:39.128 --> 14:41.506
such mean things?

14:41.548 --> 14:43.216
I think it's because

14:41.548 --> 14:43.216
she's a two-face.

14:43.257 --> 14:44.718
But that's not important.

14:44.759 --> 14:46.720
What is important

14:44.759 --> 14:46.720
is that a girl like that

14:46.761 --> 14:48.137
should not be the leader.

14:48.179 --> 14:49.764
You should be the leader.

14:49.806 --> 14:52.350
You're more honest

14:49.806 --> 14:52.350
than she is and prettier.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.769
Me? The leader?

14:54.811 --> 14:57.188
Totally. Together,

14:54.811 --> 14:57.188
we could make this

14:57.230 --> 14:59.232
the best Buttercup troop ever.

14:59.273 --> 15:02.861
All I need you to do

14:59.273 --> 15:02.861
is untie my hands.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.070
Okay.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.949
You are not going

15:06.030 --> 15:08.949
to regret this.

(body thuds)

15:11.828 --> 15:13.663
Buttercups are always loyal!

15:13.705 --> 15:16.875
Think about that

15:13.705 --> 15:16.875
while you're sleeping outside!

15:18.501 --> 15:19.794
Yeah, driving's cool.

15:19.836 --> 15:21.546
I do all my thinking

15:19.836 --> 15:21.546
when I drive.

15:21.588 --> 15:24.883
Of course, sometimes I drive

15:21.588 --> 15:24.883
and I don't think, I just drive.

15:24.924 --> 15:28.428
But no matter where I drive

15:24.924 --> 15:28.428
or how much I drive,

15:28.469 --> 15:30.971
I find that people

15:28.469 --> 15:30.971
are still people.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.182
That is so true.

15:33.224 --> 15:34.975
Thanks for letting me

15:33.224 --> 15:34.975
wear your jacket.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.853
Sure. Let me ask

15:35.017 --> 15:36.853
you something.

15:36.895 --> 15:39.439
Do you remember last week

15:36.895 --> 15:39.439
when I said "hello" to you,

15:39.480 --> 15:42.066
and you said, "Look what's

15:39.480 --> 15:42.066
trying to talk to me?"

15:42.108 --> 15:43.777
Did I?

15:43.818 --> 15:45.612
So, are you nicer to me

15:43.818 --> 15:45.612
now because you realize

15:45.653 --> 15:47.447
we have more in common

15:45.653 --> 15:47.447
than you thought,

15:47.488 --> 15:49.657
or because you find our

15:47.488 --> 15:49.657
differences intriguing,

15:49.699 --> 15:52.076
or because now

15:49.699 --> 15:52.076
I have a car?

15:52.118 --> 15:54.245
Uh, probably the car.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.245
Cool.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.997
Sometimes I love high school.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.999
Hey, why don't we drive

15:57.039 --> 15:58.999
somewhere

15:59.041 --> 16:01.628
so we can have

15:59.041 --> 16:01.628
a little privacy?

16:02.879 --> 16:05.005
I don't see why

16:02.879 --> 16:05.005
we have to drive anywhere.

16:05.047 --> 16:08.008
It's a beautiful night,

16:05.047 --> 16:08.008
I'm with a beautiful girl,

16:08.050 --> 16:10.970
there are some beautiful bushes

16:08.050 --> 16:10.970
over there.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.890
I'll get some blankets.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.015
Come on, Olivia.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.855
You are a god.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.732
A god of a special universe,

16:22.774 --> 16:25.318
where no one thinks

16:22.774 --> 16:25.318
of consequences

16:25.359 --> 16:26.736
and where those of us

16:26.778 --> 16:28.863
constrained by intelligence

16:26.778 --> 16:28.863
and common sense

16:28.905 --> 16:30.281
are not allowed.

16:30.323 --> 16:33.242
But you have invited me in,

16:30.323 --> 16:33.242
and from now on,

16:33.284 --> 16:35.035
I will follow you anywhere.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.720
Uh, I think the battery's dead!

16:52.762 --> 16:54.347
I'll jump it!

Come on, man!

16:56.098 --> 16:57.391
There's no engine!

(sirens approaching)

17:01.103 --> 17:03.105
Hey, somebody stole our engine!

17:03.147 --> 17:05.942
Nobody's going anywhere

17:03.147 --> 17:05.942
until they give it back!

17:05.984 --> 17:08.945
I'm glad the cops are coming!

17:05.984 --> 17:08.945
I want names!

17:08.987 --> 17:10.488
I'm getting worried.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.072

your kidney today.

17:52.030 --> 17:52.989
What?

17:53.031 --> 17:54.114
Susan, we talked about this

17:54.156 --> 17:55.616
on the phone four days ago.

17:55.658 --> 17:57.744
You agreed to do

17:55.658 --> 17:57.744
the procedure today.

17:57.785 --> 17:59.119
Your sister's already...

17:59.161 --> 18:00.204
My sister?

You're not allowed

Post-Op?

18:05.418 --> 18:08.046
Yep. It turns out

18:05.418 --> 18:08.046
I was a perfect match.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.757
My kidney's in a cooler

down the hall.

18:10.798 --> 18:13.634
You can either accept it

18:10.798 --> 18:13.634
or throw it in the trash.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.303
Oh, boy, this is not

18:14.802 --> 18:16.303
going to look good

18:16.345 --> 18:17.638

18:17.680 --> 18:19.306
Are you insane?

18:19.348 --> 18:21.935

18:19.348 --> 18:21.935
after I told you no?

18:21.976 --> 18:23.185
Susan, hi.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.854
Look, I know you don't

18:23.227 --> 18:24.854
care what I think,

18:24.896 --> 18:26.230

18:26.272 --> 18:28.148
that I am so happy that

18:26.272 --> 18:28.148
you agreed to do this.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.609
Oh, I didn't agree to anything.

18:29.650 --> 18:32.570
My treacherous sister

18:29.650 --> 18:32.570
has concocted

18:32.612 --> 18:34.739
a gigantic tissue

18:32.612 --> 18:34.739
of lies to trap me,

18:34.781 --> 18:36.657
but it's not going to work!

18:36.699 --> 18:37.450
What?

18:37.491 --> 18:38.534
Well, she didn't...

18:38.576 --> 18:40.536
Okay, for future reference,

18:40.578 --> 18:43.163
this  is the crazy thing

18:40.578 --> 18:43.163
I was talking about!

18:43.205 --> 18:45.625
I cannot believe

18:43.205 --> 18:45.625
you would be so spiteful

18:45.666 --> 18:49.169
as to let yourself die

18:45.666 --> 18:49.169
after what I have done for you.

18:49.211 --> 18:50.797
What you have done for me?

18:50.838 --> 18:53.173
I am so sick of this!

18:53.215 --> 18:55.009
You know, you actually have me

18:55.051 --> 18:56.094

18:58.137 --> 19:00.222
Susan, please,

18:58.137 --> 19:00.222
just take the kidney.

19:00.264 --> 19:01.891
I don't want to lose you.

19:01.933 --> 19:02.976
Okay, you know what?

19:03.017 --> 19:04.477
Can you do me a big favor

19:04.518 --> 19:06.646
and just stop pretending

19:04.518 --> 19:06.646
like you care about me?

19:06.687 --> 19:08.898
What? Susan, I love you!

19:08.940 --> 19:12.068
Oh, please.

19:08.940 --> 19:12.068
You never loved me!

19:16.489 --> 19:17.991
You see this scar?

19:18.032 --> 19:20.660
When I was six

19:18.032 --> 19:20.660
and you were four,

19:20.701 --> 19:23.203
Dad said we didn't get dessert

19:20.701 --> 19:23.203
because we were bad

19:23.245 --> 19:25.832
and you dumped his pudding

19:23.245 --> 19:25.832
on his head and said,

19:25.873 --> 19:28.626
"Yeah? Well, neither do you,"

19:25.873 --> 19:28.626
and I laughed so hard,

19:28.668 --> 19:31.629
I fell and hit my head on

19:28.668 --> 19:31.629
the corner of the coffee table.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.256
See those four freckles

19:31.671 --> 19:34.256
on your left ankle?

19:34.298 --> 19:36.216
We used to play connect-the-dots

19:36.258 --> 19:38.928
and I drew a bunny

19:36.258 --> 19:38.928
and you named it "Footy."

19:38.970 --> 19:40.596
And this hole in my ear

19:40.638 --> 19:42.306
is from when

19:40.638 --> 19:42.306
you got Dad's tackle box

19:42.348 --> 19:43.724
and you pierced my ears for me

19:43.766 --> 19:45.267
because I was too chicken

19:43.766 --> 19:45.267
to do it.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.020
And that cap on your tooth

19:47.061 --> 19:49.396
is from when Cindy Bauer

19:47.061 --> 19:49.396
called me a bitch

19:49.438 --> 19:51.231
and you beat the crap out of her

19:51.273 --> 19:53.609
and didn't think

19:51.273 --> 19:53.609
I ever knew about it.

19:53.651 --> 19:56.696
And this is the scar

19:53.651 --> 19:56.696
I got from the kidney I gave you

19:56.737 --> 19:59.406
because I love you.

19:59.448 --> 20:04.203
Don't you tell me

19:59.448 --> 20:04.203
I don't love you.

20:08.082 --> 20:10.250
Oh, for God sakes.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.879
All right,

20:10.292 --> 20:12.879
give me the damn kidney.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.254
Thank you.

20:14.296 --> 20:15.548
Don't get too excited.

20:15.589 --> 20:17.050
You know you were always

20:15.589 --> 20:17.050
the big one.

20:17.091 --> 20:20.219
We don't even know

20:17.091 --> 20:20.219
if it'll fit.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.305
Hope you boys don't think

20:21.470 --> 20:23.305
you're going anywhere.

20:23.347 --> 20:24.932
Don't worry.

20:24.974 --> 20:27.185
Until everyone who was

20:24.974 --> 20:27.185
at that party dies of old age,

20:27.226 --> 20:29.103
we have no reason

20:27.226 --> 20:29.103
to ever go out.

20:31.189 --> 20:32.314
Hey, how are you feeling?

20:32.356 --> 20:33.858
Well, it's been three days.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.275
Not so much as a thank you.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.903
No, I meant the incision.

20:36.944 --> 20:39.072
Oh. I'm still pretty sore.

20:39.113 --> 20:42.282
Yeah, well, Susan may not

20:39.113 --> 20:42.282
admit it, but she's grateful.

20:42.324 --> 20:44.326
And if it's any consolation,

20:42.324 --> 20:44.326
she took the kidney.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.703
You won.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.081
Hal, it was never about that.

20:48.122 --> 20:50.249
Nobody won.

20:53.335 --> 20:55.504
(machine humming)

21:04.388 --> 21:06.306
Help!

21:06.348 --> 21:07.767
Help!

21:09.769 --> 21:12.646
Help!
