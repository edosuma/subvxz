WEBVTT

01:13.406 --> 01:14.491
This is safe.

01:26.795 --> 01:27.754
Go.

01:28.838 --> 01:30.757
Will you be okay?

05:00.091 --> 05:01.759
How does it feel to kill a person?

05:25.199 --> 05:26.117
You will

05:27.577 --> 05:28.578
never

05:29.662 --> 05:30.705
ever

05:31.998 --> 05:33.249
forget me.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.750
Do I need to go in for questioning?

07:02.672 --> 07:03.673
Want a drink?

07:16.477 --> 07:17.645
It's the first snowfall.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.025
It's cold.

07:24.694 --> 07:25.778
Have you eaten?

07:30.908 --> 07:32.410
Do you even eat?

07:49.385 --> 07:50.887
The decor is so you.

07:56.058 --> 07:57.477
Tonight isn't…

08:03.774 --> 08:05.026
It's so stuffy in here.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.240
You shouldn't be alone
on a day like today.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.338
Do you like the snow?

08:31.177 --> 08:32.720
You never answer me.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.140
What do you like?

08:36.724 --> 08:38.726
Don't you have any hobbies?

08:40.937 --> 08:43.231
Your fridge tells me it's not cooking.

08:47.026 --> 08:47.902
Not really.

08:50.446 --> 08:52.281
Then what fun is life?

08:54.242 --> 08:55.993
Is life fun?

08:58.913 --> 09:00.248
Gosh.

09:01.999 --> 09:03.668
You're so frustrating.

09:03.751 --> 09:06.128
If you don't have any, make some.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.838
People with jobs like ours

09:07.922 --> 09:11.175
need time to relax and not think at all.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.181
Sitting on the beach.

09:19.600 --> 09:20.518
I like that.

09:21.769 --> 09:22.603
I see.

09:25.356 --> 09:26.190
Well…

09:26.941 --> 09:30.278
How nice it would be
looking at the ocean on a day like this.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.282
Should we go now?

09:35.366 --> 09:37.118
You'll lose your license if we go now.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.998
Let's go another time.

09:43.457 --> 09:45.001
I'm a really good fisher.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.461
You can't eat sushi at restaurants
after having mine.

09:47.545 --> 09:48.713
You're in trouble.

09:53.175 --> 09:54.844
There's no need to try so hard.

10:01.058 --> 10:02.143
I'm all right.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.324
You're not all right.

10:19.243 --> 10:20.328
You and Gangjae…

10:22.163 --> 10:23.581
knew each other, right?

10:25.333 --> 10:28.377
I heard at the junkyard
before I passed out.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.172
He called your name.

10:45.227 --> 10:47.188
He tried to rape me a long time ago.

10:49.523 --> 10:50.608
After drugging me.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.451
I got this scar…

11:03.037 --> 11:05.414
when I tried to wake myself from the drug…

11:13.756 --> 11:14.799
So it was Gangjae.

11:18.260 --> 11:19.929
The person you wanted to catch.

13:30.726 --> 13:33.729
I thought we'd meet after we die,
but here you are again.

13:37.566 --> 13:39.818
Are you still fighting your evils?

13:41.820 --> 13:43.322
I have no choice

13:45.074 --> 13:46.408
if I want to survive.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.372
Living is a war.

13:54.708 --> 13:58.712
You can't lose nor give in.
It is a war indeed.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.344
I don't know how else to live.

14:08.097 --> 14:09.807
Are there people you can trust?

14:15.396 --> 14:16.397
That's good then.

14:17.398 --> 14:18.732
Go after a few days' rest.

14:36.542 --> 14:37.376
Attention.

14:41.088 --> 14:44.008
These are the escape paths
Choi Mujin could have taken yesterday.

14:45.801 --> 14:50.264
Find out if anyone within a 2km radius
is associated with Dongcheon.

14:50.347 --> 14:52.016
He had to have gotten treated,

14:52.099 --> 14:53.809
so find every hospital, vet,

14:53.893 --> 14:56.061
and retired doctor in the area.
Understood?

14:56.145 --> 14:57.229
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

15:02.526 --> 15:03.360
<i>Choi Mujin!</i>

15:13.871 --> 15:15.456
Hi. It's me, Detective Na.

15:15.539 --> 15:19.168
Can I get all the documents
on that car with the fake plates?

15:19.251 --> 15:21.295
Call me when they're ready.
I'll pick them up.

15:21.962 --> 15:22.796
Okay.

15:43.400 --> 15:47.404
JIWOO

16:29.029 --> 16:31.657
SONG JOONSU

16:32.574 --> 16:33.993
Song Joonsu…

16:34.660 --> 16:35.744
<i>Who is Song Joonsu?</i>

16:35.828 --> 16:38.330
He died less than a month
after joining Narcotics.

16:40.624 --> 16:43.002
You don't know anything.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.671
SENDER
DO GANGJAE

16:52.094 --> 16:53.095
<i>Jiwoo.</i>

16:53.887 --> 16:56.890
<i>I'm going to stay here tonight. Come here.</i>

16:59.393 --> 17:02.312
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME…

17:26.295 --> 17:27.337
What's that?

17:27.421 --> 17:29.506
A factory that processes forest products.

17:36.638 --> 17:37.973
What's over that ridge?

17:38.057 --> 17:40.309
There is a small temple
on Cheonwang Mountain.

17:47.566 --> 17:48.650
It's ready.

18:25.312 --> 18:26.355
Have a seat.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.445
How do you feel?

18:36.198 --> 18:37.199
It hurts.

18:38.909 --> 18:41.245
It's a long time since
I've been stabbed. It hurts.

18:43.413 --> 18:44.915
I had forgotten…

18:47.209 --> 18:48.794
how much it hurt.

18:53.423 --> 18:55.551
Do Gangjae sent me a photo.

19:02.057 --> 19:04.476
The Song Joonsu that died 17 years ago…

19:06.103 --> 19:06.979
No…

19:09.064 --> 19:10.899
Was Dad a cop?

19:21.743 --> 19:22.578
Yes.

19:24.454 --> 19:25.873
Donghoon was a cop.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.459
Cha Giho had sent him

19:30.586 --> 19:32.421
to take down our organization.

19:35.048 --> 19:38.552
But Donghoon flipped to our side.

19:41.346 --> 19:42.848
I told you before…

19:45.100 --> 19:46.894
that he saved my life.

19:55.652 --> 19:56.820
Let's go inside.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.158
YOON DONGHOON

20:43.242 --> 20:45.244
I didn't even know my dad's name.

20:48.038 --> 20:49.081
Two names.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.752
Two identities.

20:57.756 --> 21:00.676
Must be why he always looked like
he was at the edge of a cliff.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.308
That's how you look now.

21:12.020 --> 21:13.689
Do you feel like you're on a cliff?

21:16.608 --> 21:18.277
Whenever he had time,

21:19.069 --> 21:21.029
he'd disappear somewhere by himself.

21:22.948 --> 21:24.700
I assumed it was a girl.

21:28.662 --> 21:29.705
<i>One day,</i>

21:30.956 --> 21:32.624
<i>I happened to come across him.</i>

21:34.001 --> 21:35.252
<i>So I followed him.</i>

21:36.670 --> 21:39.298
<i>I was worried
that he was seeing someone shady.</i>

21:43.176 --> 21:45.971
<i>But I just turned around and left.</i>

21:49.224 --> 21:51.476
<i>If she could make him smile like that,</i>

21:52.561 --> 21:54.563
<i>it didn't matter who she was.</i>

21:57.190 --> 21:58.442
I found out later…

22:01.069 --> 22:02.863
that you were in there.

22:08.118 --> 22:09.703
Your dad is Yoon Donghoon.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.749
He lived and died
as a member of the organization.

22:15.584 --> 22:16.585
Jiwoo.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.420
Don't lose focus.

22:20.213 --> 22:22.299
Don't forget how you got here.

22:25.635 --> 22:27.220
Why didn't you tell me?

22:30.807 --> 22:32.476
Because you need conviction

22:33.602 --> 22:35.270
in order to kill someone.

22:38.148 --> 22:40.484
I wanted you to find the answer yourself.

23:05.258 --> 23:06.343
Jiwoo.

23:09.137 --> 23:10.972
Is there still more to confirm?

23:13.600 --> 23:14.601
Or…

23:16.686 --> 23:17.979
are you hesitating?

23:32.619 --> 23:33.495
Have you

23:34.246 --> 23:35.622
seen this man?

23:36.832 --> 23:39.584
No one comes to our temple these days.

23:48.718 --> 23:52.055
People don't come to the temple much
when the weather gets cold.

23:58.061 --> 23:58.937
Hello?

24:03.817 --> 24:04.818
Where are you?

24:26.590 --> 24:28.091
<i>Was Dongcheon involved?</i>

24:28.175 --> 24:29.593
Dongcheon killed him.

24:30.677 --> 24:32.888
Cha Giho could not accept
Donghoon's betrayal

24:35.140 --> 24:36.433
and killed him.

24:37.851 --> 24:39.269
Those assholes can die.

25:06.379 --> 25:08.048
Like what happened to Yoon Donghoon.

25:14.137 --> 25:15.096
Welcome.

25:19.559 --> 25:20.393
Captain.

25:21.436 --> 25:22.687
Hey, you're here.

25:24.648 --> 25:25.607
Want some soju?

25:27.609 --> 25:28.526
It's all burnt.

25:30.654 --> 25:31.488
I won't…

25:33.323 --> 25:34.407
be able to…

25:37.535 --> 25:39.955
fall asleep if I'm sober tonight.

25:52.175 --> 25:53.176
Pildo.

25:54.386 --> 25:57.389
What will you do if you find
the asshole who killed your sister?

26:01.309 --> 26:02.435
I'll catch him.

26:03.019 --> 26:04.354
What if there's no evidence?

26:07.190 --> 26:08.525
What if you find him…

26:10.944 --> 26:12.445
but there's no evidence?

26:28.586 --> 26:29.587
What if

26:30.255 --> 26:31.923
you have the chance to kill him?

26:32.465 --> 26:35.719
No witnesses, no cameras. Nothing!

26:38.638 --> 26:40.056
What would you do?

26:42.976 --> 26:46.896
Do you remember what you said
when I joined Narcotics?

26:50.859 --> 26:53.069
"Drug investigation is
building a sandcastle.

26:54.529 --> 26:56.197
You work hard to build it,

26:56.698 --> 26:58.783
but the wave comes
and knocks it down repeatedly.

27:00.869 --> 27:04.873
But if you keep at it,
the low tide will come eventually.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.752
That's when you catch the culprit."

27:15.467 --> 27:16.468
Choi Mujin.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.471
We can catch him.

27:25.060 --> 27:26.061
Not bad.

27:32.859 --> 27:34.277
I learned from the best.

27:42.202 --> 27:44.287
-May I get a glass, please?
-Okay.

27:48.792 --> 27:49.876
Yes, sir?

27:49.959 --> 27:50.794
<i>Taeju.</i>

27:51.878 --> 27:53.880
<i>I don't think Jiwoo can finish the job.</i>

27:56.841 --> 27:58.259
<i>You get rid of Cha Giho.</i>

28:04.808 --> 28:05.892
Yes, sir.

28:09.979 --> 28:12.982
YOON DONGHOON

29:01.573 --> 29:02.657
Just a minute.

29:04.492 --> 29:06.035
Wait. Careful.

29:06.536 --> 29:07.370
Let's go.

29:32.812 --> 29:35.982
SECURITY GUARD BREAK TIMES

29:38.485 --> 29:39.486
We're home.

29:39.569 --> 29:40.695
-Want to get off?
-Yes.

29:41.279 --> 29:42.530
Careful.

29:42.614 --> 29:43.865
Careful.

29:44.407 --> 29:45.241
Your head.

29:46.034 --> 29:47.702
Get up. You're home.

29:48.244 --> 29:49.496
One, two, three.

29:51.122 --> 29:52.123
Where's your key?

29:52.707 --> 29:53.541
I have it.

29:54.250 --> 29:56.961
-I have it, so go.
-Okay.

30:00.423 --> 30:01.257
Go, Pildo.

30:01.341 --> 30:03.009
-Just open it.
-I'm okay.

30:03.092 --> 30:04.135
Go ahead.

30:05.595 --> 30:07.096
-Want me to stay the night?
-Hey.

30:15.688 --> 30:17.273
-I'll be going.
-Yes. Go, Pildo.

30:18.691 --> 30:20.026
-I love you.
-Okay.

32:45.964 --> 32:46.881
Oh Hyejin.

32:47.423 --> 32:49.258
Choi Mujin's dog!

32:51.344 --> 32:52.887
Are you here to finish me off?

32:56.432 --> 32:57.350
Drop the knife.

32:59.727 --> 33:01.980
Don't you see what's in my hand?

33:05.566 --> 33:06.567
Drop the knife.

33:08.695 --> 33:10.196
I came to ask you a question.

33:12.407 --> 33:13.324
A question?

33:15.201 --> 33:17.787
I may finish you off
depending on your answer.

33:24.711 --> 33:26.295
My dad died because of me.

33:28.297 --> 33:31.551
But he never dropped his knife
until the moment he died. To protect me.

33:33.636 --> 33:36.639
I threw everything away
and came this far to catch the bastard.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.859
Tell me what you did to my dad
five years ago today.

33:50.069 --> 33:51.070
Tell me!

34:01.372 --> 34:02.540
Jiwoo?

34:06.127 --> 34:07.128
Yoon Jiwoo?

34:16.054 --> 34:17.388
You remember my name.

34:20.141 --> 34:20.975
Why?

34:22.518 --> 34:24.020
Do you feel guilty?

34:26.230 --> 34:27.356
Donghoon… No.

34:30.276 --> 34:32.361
Joonsu was not
a member of the organization.

34:34.822 --> 34:36.199
He was a cop.

34:36.282 --> 34:37.408
I know that.

34:39.994 --> 34:42.371
And also that you sent him
into that organization.

34:42.455 --> 34:45.625
But Dad betrayed you.
Is that why you killed him?

34:47.126 --> 34:48.211
Song Jiwoo…

34:51.047 --> 34:52.048
How did you…

34:55.093 --> 34:56.636
end up under Choi Mujin?

35:01.682 --> 35:03.101
Choi Mujin…

35:04.227 --> 35:05.895
That demon!

35:20.910 --> 35:22.203
Captain!

35:23.621 --> 35:25.623
Captain.

35:26.415 --> 35:27.250
Captain!

35:28.000 --> 35:29.627
-Captain!
-Jiwoo.

35:30.837 --> 35:31.712
Captain!

35:32.672 --> 35:33.673
Jiwoo.

35:40.763 --> 35:41.848
Captain.

35:48.479 --> 35:50.314
Captain!

35:53.359 --> 35:54.485
Captain!

36:24.599 --> 36:25.766
Get out of here.

36:47.246 --> 36:49.874
JUNG TAEJU
SECOND-IN-COMMAND

36:52.793 --> 36:54.337
Taeju, you arrange them.

36:54.420 --> 36:55.254
Okay.

36:56.589 --> 36:57.798
You, step in.

36:58.424 --> 36:59.425
-Come on.
-Yes, sir.

36:59.967 --> 37:01.802
