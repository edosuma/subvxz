00:00.961 --> 00:02.504
<i>Previously on iZombie...</i>

00:02.712 --> 00:05.048
- What are you?
- There are zombies
in the world, Peyton.

00:05.256 --> 00:06.174
And I'm one of them.

00:06.383 --> 00:08.635
Once Super Max hits shelves,
you'll be untouchable.

00:08.843 --> 00:10.887
Assuming we're not
mid-zombie apocalypse.

00:11.096 --> 00:12.722
Our surveillance has paid off.

00:12.931 --> 00:14.975
- Hey, roomie.
<i>- We've solved
the zombie problem.</i>

00:15.183 --> 00:17.894
- And how's that?
- We've located the instrument
of their destruction.

00:18.103 --> 00:20.355
<i>So I showed up to train
a new client today,
and he was a zombie.</i>

00:20.563 --> 00:22.107
<i>I knew.
My hair stood on end.</i>

00:22.315 --> 00:25.360
Those 322 people
are suspected zombies.

00:25.568 --> 00:26.987
- You want me to kill them?
- Yes.

00:27.195 --> 00:28.446
<i>You've got
the wrong man for the job.</i>

00:28.655 --> 00:30.573
We do know of one zombie,
Liv Moore.

00:30.782 --> 00:31.825
I've got you over a barrel,
big guy.

00:33.743 --> 00:36.788
Utopium.
We need to get more of this.

00:36.997 --> 00:38.623
- Major? It's me.
- Kinda busy.

00:47.382 --> 00:50.719
Remember at the Botox party,
how she was going around
behind my back,

00:50.927 --> 00:52.470
telling everyone
I was a bitch?

00:52.679 --> 00:54.305
So I called her on it.

00:54.514 --> 00:57.058
Today at lunch. Ha!
She flat-out denied it.
Can you believe it?

00:57.267 --> 00:58.977
<i>Oh, my God!
What did you do?</i>

00:59.185 --> 01:02.063
I threw my drink
in her face and I walked out.

01:04.232 --> 01:07.652
I mean, I love that woman,
but she is just
too much drama.

01:09.738 --> 01:11.114
Hold on, sweetie.

01:15.618 --> 01:18.163
Hi. I'm Alex Towne,
with Montlake Realty.

01:18.371 --> 01:20.290
Are you the owner?

01:20.498 --> 01:22.834
Because I have a client
who is looking for a home
just like this.

01:23.043 --> 01:25.378
I'm sorry, Mr. Towne,
my husband and I
aren't looking to sell.

01:25.587 --> 01:26.796
That's too bad.

01:27.005 --> 01:28.840
For the right property,

01:29.049 --> 01:31.051
my client is willing
to make an all-cash offer
of $10 million.

01:32.510 --> 01:33.970
May I see the view?

01:38.808 --> 01:41.311
Spectacular, isn't it?
And private.

01:41.519 --> 01:43.354
Which is rare, even in
this neighbor...

02:05.543 --> 02:08.505
<i>Taylor, honey? Hello?</i>

02:10.632 --> 02:12.467
<i>Did he say 10 million?</i>

02:37.700 --> 02:39.369
She must have taken
quite a fall.

02:39.577 --> 02:41.162
The other implant burst
on impact.

02:42.747 --> 02:44.124
German. Top of the line.

02:46.626 --> 02:49.254
DOA's name is Taylor Fowler,
age 38.

02:49.462 --> 02:51.422
Wife number two
of Terrence Fowler.

02:51.631 --> 02:54.092
He started the warehouse
liquor chain
Booze of the World.

02:54.300 --> 02:55.260
Taylor married well.

02:55.468 --> 02:56.636
And died hard.

02:56.845 --> 03:00.932
The fall fractured her C3
and C4 cervical vertebrae,
resulting in spinal shock.

03:01.141 --> 03:04.310
Pretty amazing the guy
she took down with her
is still alive.

03:04.519 --> 03:06.104
Technically. He's in a coma.

03:06.312 --> 03:09.399
The hospital's not optimistic
he'll ever come out of it.

03:11.943 --> 03:13.278
What?

03:14.237 --> 03:15.905
Carpal tunnel. Sorry.

03:21.703 --> 03:25.039
I also learned
our coma guy's name
is not Alex Towne, realtor,

03:25.206 --> 03:28.001
despite the business card
we found in his front pocket.

03:28.209 --> 03:31.921
He's Joe Fricano,
a small-time mope
with a history of larceny.

03:32.130 --> 03:35.008
Hmm.
A thief posing as a realtor.
Seems like a lateral move.

03:35.216 --> 03:38.052
Unless he was trying to case
a house from the inside.

03:38.261 --> 03:40.471
We found a printout
of Taylor's Facebook page

03:40.680 --> 03:42.473
with a profile photo
in Joe's pocket.

03:42.682 --> 03:43.975
He wrote her Pilates
schedule on it.

03:44.184 --> 03:46.102
I think we're looking
at a murder-for-hire.

03:46.311 --> 03:48.354
All we have to do is figure
out who did the hiring.

03:48.563 --> 03:50.481
If only contract killers
filed W-4s.

03:50.690 --> 03:51.774
It's the spouse.

03:51.983 --> 03:53.193
We know that's
your default theory.

03:53.401 --> 03:55.153
I'm trying to bring
him in for an interview,

03:55.361 --> 03:57.113
but Terrence Fowler
is a very busy man

03:57.322 --> 03:58.698
with a very fancy lawyer.

03:58.907 --> 04:00.909
While he tries to find
a mutually agreeable time,

04:01.117 --> 04:03.161
I've got the real Alex Towne
coming in later.

04:03.369 --> 04:04.621
Want to see
if that sparks anything?

04:04.829 --> 04:05.747
Sure.

04:05.955 --> 04:09.000
Hey, later-later, like Friday,

04:09.209 --> 04:13.046
I was thinking we could all
grab a drink after work,
maybe get a bite to eat?

04:13.254 --> 04:15.256
I mean, if you guys are free.

04:15.465 --> 04:17.926
It's just been a while
since we got together.

04:18.885 --> 04:20.803
Friday's tricky, yeah.

04:21.012 --> 04:23.223
I've been seeing
Stephanie. You know,
the girl I met at the club.

04:23.431 --> 04:25.600
Been seeing a lot of her,
actually.

04:25.808 --> 04:27.936
She's trying to get Friday
night off work so she can fix
me a home-cooked meal.

04:28.144 --> 04:31.522
Turns out, right,
she's got this whole
Martha Stewart side to her.

04:31.731 --> 04:32.815
Which, combined
with her raw honesty

04:33.024 --> 04:34.317
and lack of intellectual
pretense

04:34.525 --> 04:36.152
is giving me a sense
of emotional intimacy

04:36.361 --> 04:38.529
I've not felt
in a long time, you know?

04:43.201 --> 04:44.786
Can't. Busy.

04:47.538 --> 04:50.041
God, I thought
he'd never shut up.

04:50.250 --> 04:53.002
Moving on
to your more immediate
dining plans...

04:54.921 --> 04:57.173
I've never had a
lady-who-lunches for lunch.

05:08.893 --> 05:10.812
She looks as tasty
as she was tasteful.

05:27.578 --> 05:30.373
Shouldn't you be working
on something other than your
pectoralis majors, Major?

05:30.581 --> 05:32.750
You just missed
my lower body circuit.

05:32.959 --> 05:35.545
You know what? I think of you
every time I squat.

05:35.753 --> 05:38.381
Oh, you mean the list.

05:38.589 --> 05:40.300
Don't worry, I'm on it.

05:40.508 --> 05:42.302
I crossed another name
off this morning.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.512
- Not a zombie?
- Not a zombie.

05:45.513 --> 05:46.681
Just a normal human being.

05:46.889 --> 05:48.599
I'm allowed to not
kill those, right?

05:48.808 --> 05:50.643
You're cute.

05:50.852 --> 05:52.895
But Vaughn Du Clark
expects results.

05:53.104 --> 05:55.315
Does a patient man
invent an energy drink?

05:55.523 --> 05:59.485
I'd be happy to let him
take over the zombie
eradication detail.

05:59.694 --> 06:00.653
Just say the word.

06:01.821 --> 06:04.866
Let me tell you a story.

06:05.074 --> 06:08.036
When we first came up
with the "Suspected Zombie"
list,

06:08.244 --> 06:10.288
Vaughn's idea was to
send them all letters,

06:10.496 --> 06:12.749
zombies and non-zombies alike,

06:12.957 --> 06:16.919
informing them they'd won
an all-expense-paid
Hawaiian cruise.

06:17.128 --> 06:20.214
And then scuttle the ship
in the middle of the Pacific.

06:21.966 --> 06:23.885
Your work,

06:24.093 --> 06:25.636
distasteful as you find it,

06:26.596 --> 06:28.723
saves lives.

06:31.184 --> 06:34.270
Move too slow,
he'll happily revisit
plan B.

06:39.734 --> 06:41.778
To think that some criminal
would use my card

06:41.986 --> 06:44.655
and my reputation
as a specialist
in luxury properties...

06:44.864 --> 06:47.200
He probably picked
it up at one of
your open houses.

06:47.408 --> 06:49.369
Well, I host four or five
of them each weekend.

06:49.577 --> 06:53.206
I'm happy to help.
But I doubt I'll be able
to remember one looky-loo.

06:53.414 --> 06:55.708
Liv, anything you want to ask?

06:56.834 --> 06:58.169
Yes.

06:58.378 --> 06:59.796
Your bag. Is it a Stella?

07:02.423 --> 07:04.509
- Timeless, isn't it?
- I can't even...

07:04.717 --> 07:06.886
I wasn't sure
if it would be appropriate
for a police interview.

07:07.095 --> 07:08.179
It's perfect.

07:08.388 --> 07:09.680
It's businesslike,
but with an informality

07:09.889 --> 07:11.849
that says,
"I am not a suspect."

07:14.852 --> 07:16.771
Here's our killer.

07:16.979 --> 07:18.856
He's the one
who used your card.
You recognize him?

07:19.857 --> 07:21.567
Actually, I do.

07:21.776 --> 07:23.820
He came to my showing
of a Mercer Island
contemporary.

07:24.028 --> 07:25.947
Oh, 4,000 square feet.

07:26.155 --> 07:27.323
Chef's kitchen.

07:27.532 --> 07:29.409
Great flow.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.285
I found him poking around
in a night stand
in the master bedroom

07:31.494 --> 07:32.412
and I asked him to leave.

07:32.620 --> 07:33.704
Any idea
what was he looking for?

07:33.913 --> 07:36.499
A souvenir, I assumed.

07:36.707 --> 07:40.128
The owner is one of Seattle's
most eligible bachelors.

07:41.462 --> 07:42.672
Vaughn Du Clark.

07:44.006 --> 07:45.967
Max Rager CEO,
Vaughn Du Clark?

07:46.175 --> 07:47.176
Mmm-hmm.

07:47.385 --> 07:49.262
He's Seattle's
most eligible bachelor?

07:49.470 --> 07:51.055
You need to rethink
your ranking.

07:51.264 --> 07:53.558
Just hearing his name makes me
need a full body detox wrap

07:53.766 --> 07:55.184
and an ear canal flush.

08:34.474 --> 08:37.310
Once more around the park,
James? No?

08:58.623 --> 09:00.875
Let me out, please!

09:02.168 --> 09:03.961
I won't press charges!

09:04.170 --> 09:06.297
Just take me to an ATM!

09:06.506 --> 09:08.925
I'll give you
as much as you want!
Please!

09:09.133 --> 09:12.261
Don't hurt me.
Don't hurt my dog.

09:12.470 --> 09:14.639
I never saw your face.

09:14.847 --> 09:16.682
I never saw your face!
I can't identify you,
I promise.

09:17.475 --> 09:18.476
Let me out!

09:42.083 --> 09:45.044
I'm confused.
Is this the Seattle morgue
or a Milan catwalk?

09:45.253 --> 09:46.170
You like?

09:47.463 --> 09:48.839
It's my roommate's.

09:49.048 --> 09:50.550
I literally had nothing
to wear

09:50.758 --> 09:53.010
until she gave me a free pass
to raid her closet.

09:53.219 --> 09:54.720
I thought this was
a good look for work

09:54.929 --> 09:56.847
because I wear this dress
like someone's paying me to.

09:57.056 --> 09:59.058
Oh, as do I with this.

09:59.267 --> 10:01.394
Ready to go hang
Vaughn Du Clark's ass

10:01.602 --> 10:04.021
from the highest tree?

10:04.230 --> 10:07.692
When rich wives get killed,
it's either about money
or sex.

10:07.900 --> 10:08.734
Vaughn has no motive.

10:08.943 --> 10:11.028
That we know of, yet.

10:11.237 --> 10:13.614
Don't forget he offed
a reporter who dug too deep
into Max Rager business.

10:13.823 --> 10:15.866
- We couldn't prove that.
- Prove-schmove.

10:16.075 --> 10:18.327
Arranging a murder
is well within his skill set.

10:18.536 --> 10:19.704
You know it. I know it.

10:19.912 --> 10:21.038
- I know it.
- It's known.

10:21.247 --> 10:22.999
The spouse is still
our number one suspect.

10:23.207 --> 10:25.209
Terrence agreed to come
in later for an interview.

10:25.418 --> 10:27.545
It turns out he sits
on the Max Rager board,
so maybe...

10:27.753 --> 10:30.548
Are you kidding with this?
The Max Rager board.

10:30.756 --> 10:34.218
Hello? That's our
Taylor-Vaughn connection.
Vaughn's our guy.

10:34.427 --> 10:36.304
What I was going to say is,

10:36.512 --> 10:38.514
maybe Vaughn can tell
us something that'll
incriminate Terrence.

10:41.309 --> 10:42.768
You ever think
about a pocket square,

10:42.977 --> 10:44.103
a little splash of color?

10:45.187 --> 10:46.856
Every time I get dressed.

10:50.651 --> 10:52.278
Of course
I knew Taylor.

10:52.486 --> 10:54.905
Terrence brought her to board
functions from time to time.

10:55.114 --> 10:57.908
The woman was a real hoot,
let me tell ya.

10:58.117 --> 11:00.244
Always keeping waiters
on their toes,
always getting her way.

11:00.453 --> 11:03.247
You know what would be great?
If I could get
a sparkling water

11:03.456 --> 11:05.082
with a little lime,
<i>s'il vous plait.</i>

11:05.750 --> 11:08.169
Thank you.

11:08.377 --> 11:10.379
What were Taylor and Terrence
like at these functions?

11:10.588 --> 11:13.215
Entitled, vain.
They fit right in.

11:13.424 --> 11:16.886
As a couple,
were they combative?
Affectionate?

11:17.094 --> 11:19.722
How much affection do you
ever really see for couples
who are married so long?

11:19.930 --> 11:21.974
There's a reason
I'm not getting hitched,
Detective.

11:22.183 --> 11:24.393
Because you can't legally
marry your own reflection?

11:24.602 --> 11:26.270
Burn.

11:26.479 --> 11:28.522
Your real estate agent
caught the man
who killed Taylor

11:28.731 --> 11:30.775
going through your drawers
at your open house.

11:30.983 --> 11:32.777
Seems weird, doesn't it?

11:32.985 --> 11:33.903
Yes, it does.

11:36.405 --> 11:37.782
Totally weird.

11:37.990 --> 11:39.367
What's your relationship
with Terrence like?

11:39.575 --> 11:41.577
How would you describe him
as a board member?

11:41.786 --> 11:43.454
Rich.
Wanting to be richer.

11:43.663 --> 11:45.206
I can work with that.

11:45.414 --> 11:46.374
Your three o'clock's here.

11:46.582 --> 11:47.667
Oh, no, no, no. Not yet.

11:50.753 --> 11:52.546
Not yet.

11:54.465 --> 11:56.008
Not yet.

11:56.217 --> 11:58.052
Not yet!

12:00.846 --> 12:02.890
Ms. Moore?
Are you still with us?

12:03.099 --> 12:06.310
My eyes. They burn.

12:06.519 --> 12:08.646
- Do you know
what she's talking about?
- Occasionally.

12:08.854 --> 12:11.982
I'm talking about your dirty
little tantric secret.

12:12.191 --> 12:15.277
So, how many times
did you have sex with Taylor?

12:18.989 --> 12:21.409
Is that your attempt
to trip me up? Huh?

12:22.993 --> 12:24.495
Zero, Ms. Moore. Zero.

12:24.704 --> 12:26.288
We were not lovers, and

12:26.497 --> 12:30.126
at the risk of sounding
like a cliche,
I prefer younger women.

12:30.918 --> 12:33.003
Blonder women.

12:33.212 --> 12:35.297
Are you just gonna let him
talk to me like that?

12:35.506 --> 12:36.465
Like what?

12:38.300 --> 12:40.177
I am not your little whore!

12:41.846 --> 12:43.723
Okay.
I suppose we're done.

12:47.810 --> 12:51.272
I'm really starting to believe
that you don't like me,
Ms. Moore.

12:59.405 --> 13:00.823
Major?

13:02.700 --> 13:04.326
Oh, you two
know each other?

13:14.712 --> 13:15.671
Hey, Liv.

13:17.339 --> 13:18.340
New nails?

13:20.092 --> 13:23.596
Now you're talking to me?
Because I'm kinda busy.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.973
Sound familiar?
And, yes, they're new.

13:26.182 --> 13:29.602
The color is called
"Sorry, Beyonce" and
I might be in love with it.

13:30.770 --> 13:32.521
Like you care.

13:32.730 --> 13:34.440
As long as I've got you,

13:34.648 --> 13:36.734
I had a few more questions
about the Meat Cute
incident.

13:36.942 --> 13:40.279
Oh, did you get re-assigned
to the Solved Crime Squad?

13:40.488 --> 13:42.907
Clive, can you just
give us a moment?

13:43.115 --> 13:44.325
Liv, I don't think
this is the time...

13:44.533 --> 13:46.327
Listen to me, mister.

13:46.535 --> 13:48.913
It's one thing to blow
me off when I drop by
without calling

13:49.121 --> 13:52.249
and you're upstairs
in your room
doing God knows what.

13:52.458 --> 13:56.962
But how can you be here,
working for him?

13:57.171 --> 13:59.924
I've got to make a living,
you know. I was training
a guy who worked here.

14:00.132 --> 14:02.718
He gave me some positive
word-of-mouth, so a bunch more
started coming to me.

14:02.927 --> 14:05.596
- I go where the work is.
- "I was just following
orders."

14:05.805 --> 14:07.264
That's what Nazis say.

14:07.473 --> 14:09.016
- You're being a little
ridiculous.
- I'm what?

14:10.059 --> 14:11.977
Oh! Wow.

14:12.186 --> 14:14.146
You, too, pal? She's a pistol.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.858
I'm so sorry, Major.
It's not me. It's the brain.

14:18.067 --> 14:20.027
Major. Let's go to work.

14:21.195 --> 14:23.447
Take me to church!

14:26.951 --> 14:29.286
One of us needed to slap him.

14:29.495 --> 14:31.121
What happened back
in Vaughn's office?

14:31.330 --> 14:32.665
I assume you had one
of your psychic visions

14:32.873 --> 14:34.375
that told you Vaughn
was sleeping with Taylor?

14:34.583 --> 14:36.377
Yeah.
The kind I would like
to erase.

14:36.585 --> 14:39.463
The man has sex with an ankh
necklace on.

14:39.672 --> 14:41.715
On a leather cord.

14:43.425 --> 14:44.969
Damn it.

14:45.177 --> 14:48.472
Terrence's lawyer just pushed
the interview, time TBD.

14:48.681 --> 14:50.599
And he's insisting
we do it at his house.

14:50.808 --> 14:52.059
I hate rich people. I do.

14:52.268 --> 14:53.519
I screwed up bad, Clive.

14:53.727 --> 14:55.646
With Major? Did you?

14:55.855 --> 14:57.773
I can never tell
what the end goal
is with you two.

14:59.859 --> 15:01.986
When Killer Joe
wasn't pushing women
off balconies,

15:02.194 --> 15:04.488
he installed car stereos.

15:04.697 --> 15:07.324
We need to drop by his job
and see if we can establish
how Terrence came to hire him.

15:07.533 --> 15:09.743
Or how Vaughn
came to hire him.

15:11.245 --> 15:12.788
Yeah.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.835
So you had no idea Joe
was mixed up in
anything illegal?

15:18.043 --> 15:19.795
No.

15:20.004 --> 15:22.172
You recognize either of
these guys? Either one
bring their cars in?

15:22.381 --> 15:24.258
- No.
- Nuh-uh.

15:24.466 --> 15:26.719
Joe did a huge install
for some mystery guy
at his house, though.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.429
If you're rich enough,
we'll come to you.

15:28.637 --> 15:30.514
Well, somebody's gotta know
the client's name.

15:30.723 --> 15:32.057
Our manager will know,
but he's out on some salmon
fishing trip.

15:32.266 --> 15:34.018
He'll be back
in a couple days.

15:34.226 --> 15:35.519
Have your manager
give me a call
when he gets back to town.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.569
Uh, Terrence wants to meet
with us now.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.446
Oh, I'll just wait here.

15:46.697 --> 15:47.907
For you to pull up the car.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.075
What am I, Driving Miss Crazy?

15:50.284 --> 15:51.869
I didn't know
I'd be walking today.

15:52.077 --> 15:53.579
This is more
of a sitting shoe.

15:53.787 --> 15:54.788
Super cute though, huh?

15:54.997 --> 15:56.790
Look how long
they make my legs look.

15:56.999 --> 15:59.501
You need to use
those long legs
and get yourself to my car.

16:08.344 --> 16:10.262
That is quite a view.

16:10.471 --> 16:12.973
Yup, that's Mount Rainier.

16:13.182 --> 16:14.975
Taylor used to text me, "TMO."

16:18.062 --> 16:19.980
"The mountain's out."

16:20.189 --> 16:22.650
How would you describe
your relationship over
the past few weeks?

16:27.363 --> 16:28.906
Happy.

16:31.617 --> 16:35.579
Oh, we were planning
to celebrate
our 10th anniversary

16:35.788 --> 16:37.915
next month with a trip
to the Turks and Caicos.

16:38.123 --> 16:39.917
And those are reservations
I can call and check on?

16:40.125 --> 16:43.253
Of course. My assistant
can get you
the pertinent numbers.

16:43.462 --> 16:46.298
- Meg! Get them
my vacation details.
- Yes.

16:46.507 --> 16:48.258
Where were you
at the time of the murder?

16:48.467 --> 16:51.512
Forgive me, the past
36 hours have been a blur.

16:52.262 --> 16:54.306
Meg?

16:54.515 --> 16:57.351
- You were with
your personal stylist.
- Oh, right.

16:57.559 --> 17:01.188
I was looking over some things
she had picked out for me.

17:01.397 --> 17:02.856
I'll need her number, too.

17:03.065 --> 17:05.484
Now that's how you rock
a pocket square, by the way.

17:05.693 --> 17:06.777
Are we almost done here,
Detective?

17:06.986 --> 17:08.112
Almost, Harry.

17:10.823 --> 17:13.242
What can you tell me
about your wife's affair
with Vaughn Du Clark?

17:17.079 --> 17:18.914
I'm sorry. Did you not know
about their affair?

17:21.667 --> 17:23.085
I'll take that as a "No."

17:23.293 --> 17:24.962
So help me, I'm gonna...

17:25.170 --> 17:26.588
Now we're done.

17:32.553 --> 17:34.596
That certainly looked like
a man who just found out
his wife was cheating on him.

17:34.805 --> 17:36.890
He's definitely capable
of violence.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.687
I'd hate
to be Vaughn Du Clark.

17:45.274 --> 17:47.192
Trying it out for size?

17:49.403 --> 17:52.156
You had to screw
Taylor Fowler?

17:52.364 --> 17:54.867
Her husband represents
a very important swing
vote on the board.

17:56.535 --> 17:57.911
I promise
it will never happen again.

17:58.120 --> 18:01.832
'Cause, you know, she's dead.

18:02.041 --> 18:03.125
Wait, how do you know
about that?

18:03.333 --> 18:05.335
Somehow my zombie
roommate knew.

18:05.544 --> 18:08.005
I don't know how.

18:08.213 --> 18:10.424
Try to keep it in your pants
next time.

18:10.632 --> 18:13.552
Can you do that, champ?

18:13.761 --> 18:15.596
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

18:15.804 --> 18:17.681
Come on, now.
Let's not throw the baby out
with the bath water.

18:17.890 --> 18:21.060
Remember, if it weren't
for me sleeping with
other men's wives,

18:22.019 --> 18:24.772
you would not exist.

18:24.980 --> 18:28.317
Maybe you can have one
of those floozies pin a medal
on your baby-maker.

18:31.570 --> 18:33.113
Perhaps a clip-on.

19:04.937 --> 19:08.565
I had you as more
of a plyometrics guy.

19:08.774 --> 19:12.194
Thought you'd be into
the short, explosive bursts.

19:16.949 --> 19:19.368
But I guess we're both
into slow and controlled,

19:20.661 --> 19:22.121
making it last.

19:42.266 --> 19:43.809
You don't have to go.

19:45.269 --> 19:47.104
I was just looking
for an exercise ball.

20:07.749 --> 20:10.460
Terrence said
he was with you
at the time of the murder.

20:10.669 --> 20:12.212
Looking at some clothes
you found for him.

20:12.421 --> 20:14.673
Textured winter
shirts and day-to-night
denims, yes.

20:14.882 --> 20:16.675
How was he behaving?

20:16.884 --> 20:18.677
Well, he was
pretty skeptical about
wearing denim after 6:00.

20:18.886 --> 20:21.847
Did he seem distracted?
Did he check his watch
or take any calls?

20:22.055 --> 20:23.223
I don't think so, no.

20:23.432 --> 20:25.475
Could your view be nicer?

20:25.684 --> 20:27.811
I see this and I just think
"mat Pilates."

20:28.020 --> 20:30.022
This is where I do yoga.

20:30.230 --> 20:32.191
I can hold a warrior pose
for six minutes
if I'm watching the ferries.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.359
I have to say,
you're kind of a genius.

20:34.568 --> 20:36.570
- You get paid to shop?
Uh,
it's still a job.

20:36.778 --> 20:38.989
My fashion sense
doesn't always match
the client's.

20:39.198 --> 20:41.033
Those shoes are amaze,
by the way.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.994
Thanks. They're actually
my roommate's.

20:44.203 --> 20:46.079
I'm looking to find some that
are like them, but...

20:46.246 --> 20:47.206
Strappier.

20:47.414 --> 20:48.832
- Yes.
- Possibly in suede.

20:49.041 --> 20:51.084
Could you crawl back
out of my mind?

20:51.251 --> 20:53.170
Can I ask
a non-shoe related question?

20:57.174 --> 20:59.801
Did you ever talk
to Terrence's wife, Taylor?

21:00.010 --> 21:01.428
Mostly about clothes.

21:01.637 --> 21:03.347
She was the fashion-conscious
one in the marriage.

21:03.555 --> 21:05.390
With friends like hers,
you'd have to be.

21:05.599 --> 21:07.935
- Have you met Camille
and Debra?
- No.

21:08.143 --> 21:09.770
Great dressers. Awful people.

21:12.940 --> 21:17.194
You and Ms. Debra Canfield
are two of Taylor's
closest friends. Can you...

21:17.402 --> 21:19.696
I'm going to stop you
right there.

21:19.905 --> 21:21.865
I love Debra dearly,

21:22.074 --> 21:23.575
but she can be a real
piece of work.

21:23.784 --> 21:25.577
And the drinking doesn't help.

21:25.786 --> 21:29.331
She ruined Taylor's
wine tasting for juvenile
lupus research

21:29.539 --> 21:31.875
by throwing up
on Kenny G's table.

21:32.084 --> 21:33.752
- When was this?
- About three months ago.

21:33.961 --> 21:35.462
Debra never apologized.

21:35.671 --> 21:37.214
It got ugly.

21:37.422 --> 21:40.592
Look, I love Camille
like a sister,

21:40.801 --> 21:42.761
but she is a compulsive liar.

21:42.970 --> 21:45.222
And she stole Taylor's
business idea.

21:45.430 --> 21:49.685
Camille told Taylor,
"If you sue me, I will shut
your Botoxed face for good."

21:49.893 --> 21:51.895
Please.
I would never say that.

21:52.104 --> 21:55.065
Unlike Debra, I'm the kind
of friend that was always
there for Taylor.

21:55.274 --> 21:58.068
Like when she found out
Terrence was meeting trashy
little gold-diggers

21:58.277 --> 22:01.071
on that website,
SugarDaddio.com.

22:01.280 --> 22:03.448
What-what-io dot com?

22:03.657 --> 22:05.909
Was Camille there for Taylor
the night that Terrence
punched a hole in the wall

22:06.118 --> 22:07.911
when he found out
she was having an affair?

22:10.914 --> 22:13.709
Vaughn Du Clark?
Vaughn Du Clark?

22:13.917 --> 22:16.628
Go video chat with one
of your online gold-diggers,
sugar daddy.

22:16.837 --> 22:18.588
Anybody else! Anybody else!

22:18.797 --> 22:20.924
Not him! Never him!

22:23.593 --> 22:27.014
You know, I sometimes
space out like that when
I'm on a master cleanse.

22:27.889 --> 22:29.725
Excuse us.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.855
What did you just see?

22:35.063 --> 22:37.399
When we interviewed Terrence,
he already knew that Taylor
was sleeping with Vaughn.

22:37.607 --> 22:38.859
I saw the moment
he learned about the affair.

22:39.067 --> 22:42.112
He was pulling
his fist out of a wall. Eek!

22:42.321 --> 22:44.614
So when he shattered
that coffee table,
it was all an act.

22:44.823 --> 22:46.199
I thought
you'd be more surprised.

22:46.366 --> 22:47.826
I was reasonably surprised.

22:48.035 --> 22:51.496
I know, but I was hoping
for something like, "Ah!"

22:51.705 --> 22:55.042
Anyway, Taylor was all,
"Go back to your online sluts,
sugar daddy."

22:57.586 --> 23:00.213
You need to let me go
or bring me a mineral water.

23:05.010 --> 23:06.470
You'll never guess
where I saw Major

23:06.678 --> 23:08.638
doing his personal trainer
thing yesterday.

23:08.847 --> 23:09.973
I don't know. The gym?

23:11.350 --> 23:12.726
Oi, I was watching that.

23:12.934 --> 23:14.561
Max Rager.

23:14.728 --> 23:16.772
He's been working there?

23:16.980 --> 23:18.065
I can't believe
he didn't tell me.

23:18.273 --> 23:20.150
Oh, everything
has to be about you.

23:23.487 --> 23:27.366
<i>We will destroy
your criminal enterprise.
That is my pledge...</i>

23:27.574 --> 23:29.159
I am literally
going through hell.

23:29.368 --> 23:31.078
Do you even care?

23:31.286 --> 23:33.663
Okay, you've literally
forgotten the meaning
of the word "Literally."

23:33.872 --> 23:36.750
It's not my fault!
All my friends are
cold-hearted bitches,

23:36.958 --> 23:38.418
and that includes the men.

23:38.627 --> 23:41.171
Why is everyone
abandoning me? Why?

23:46.343 --> 23:51.014
I'm sorry. I just really need
a pinot and some salty
chocolate right now.

23:51.223 --> 23:52.933
This has been
the worst week ever.

23:54.810 --> 23:56.853
Was Stephanie able to get
Friday night off?

23:57.062 --> 23:58.772
Oh, yeah.

23:58.980 --> 24:00.816
- Sorry.
- Congratulations.

24:01.024 --> 24:02.692
At least you have someone
to go to dinner with.

24:04.236 --> 24:06.530
<i>We are coming after you.</i>

24:06.738 --> 24:09.157
- What's going on?
- Oh, big announcement.

24:09.366 --> 24:11.576
Citywide crackdown
on the Utopium scourge.

24:11.785 --> 24:15.163
<i>To this end, we have formed
a Utopium task force,</i>

24:15.372 --> 24:18.333
<i>headed by a colleague
I am pleased to welcome
back from sabbatical,</i>

24:18.542 --> 24:20.794
<i>assistant DA
Peyton Charles. Peyton?</i>

24:21.002 --> 24:24.047
<i>Thank you, District Attorney
Baracus, for the confidence
you've placed in me.</i>

24:24.256 --> 24:26.383
<i>I promise I will not
let you down...</i>

24:26.591 --> 24:29.010
I don't suppose she told you
she was back in the country.

24:31.721 --> 24:32.889
No. You?

24:33.098 --> 24:34.433
<i>For anyone
in the Utopium trade,</i>

24:34.641 --> 24:36.726
<i>I'm here to tell you,
party's over.</i>

24:36.935 --> 24:38.186
No.

24:46.236 --> 24:49.739
Not a word from Peyton
in three months. And then,
poof, she just shows up?

24:49.948 --> 24:52.033
At least she's comfortable
enough to be back
in the same city as you.

24:52.242 --> 24:55.745
How can you be so
la-dee-da about it?
She ditched you, too.

24:55.954 --> 24:58.165
It's weird, having her
just pop up like that.

24:58.373 --> 25:00.667
But, you know, we were only
dating for a few weeks.

25:02.085 --> 25:03.837
I guess I'm ready to move on.

25:04.045 --> 25:07.757
Look, you and Peyton
have been best friends
since college.

25:07.966 --> 25:10.260
You just don't casually walk
away from that.

25:10.469 --> 25:13.221
I bet she'll want to
be back in your life.

25:13.430 --> 25:14.598
Maybe not right away.

25:14.806 --> 25:16.391
But eventually.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.936
And when she does,
I hope you've left
the door open.

25:29.404 --> 25:30.864
Hello?

25:31.072 --> 25:33.283
Hi, this is Bethany Miller.
Mr. Fowler's stylist.

25:33.492 --> 25:35.118
Oh, hi. What's up?

25:35.327 --> 25:36.620
<i>I found the shoes.</i>

25:36.828 --> 25:39.664
Suede and strappy in black.

25:39.873 --> 25:42.292
- Really?
- I picked them up on approval.

25:42.501 --> 25:43.502
Do you want to try them on?

25:48.298 --> 25:51.259
These shoes
literally go with everything.

25:51.468 --> 25:54.221
This dress, those pants,
this wine...

25:54.429 --> 25:56.640
That dress doesn't deserve
to share a closet
with those shoes.

25:56.848 --> 25:58.225
You might as well wear
a burlap sack.

25:58.433 --> 26:00.018
I got it
on vacation.

26:00.227 --> 26:03.396
To Amish country?
Girl, don't hide
your killer bod.

26:03.605 --> 26:05.774
You need to dump
that boxy for some foxy.

26:05.982 --> 26:07.442
Mmm.

26:07.651 --> 26:10.987
Oh. Here.
This is more like it.

26:11.196 --> 26:12.656
That belongs to someone.

26:12.864 --> 26:14.699
A long time ago,

26:14.908 --> 26:16.284
we used to be friends.

26:16.826 --> 26:18.161
Hmm.

26:19.579 --> 26:21.790
Ready to try on something red?

26:21.998 --> 26:23.375
White is so last bottle.

26:27.837 --> 26:31.174
Speaking of too much to drink,
how were Debra and Camille?

26:31.383 --> 26:33.969
I wish we could put them
in jail just for being
horrible people.

26:34.177 --> 26:36.388
God, please don't let me run
into either of them tomorrow.

26:36.596 --> 26:37.806
Unless it's with your car.

26:39.808 --> 26:42.310
Oh, I'm going
to an invitation-only sale

26:42.519 --> 26:44.563
at one of my favorite
boutiques tomorrow.

26:44.771 --> 26:46.898
- You wanna be my plus one?
- Aw.

26:47.107 --> 26:50.360
I can't remember the last time
I was plus one'd.

26:50.569 --> 26:52.362
- That sale won't know
what hit it.
- Mmm.

27:03.832 --> 27:06.042
Good, you're here.

27:06.251 --> 27:09.087
I just had to see
what you'd think
of these bad girls.

27:09.296 --> 27:11.840
If they don't make
you want to cross-dress,
I don't know what will.

27:12.048 --> 27:13.675
You ever hear
of Casual Fridays?

27:13.883 --> 27:16.678
You ever hear
of casual elegance?

27:16.886 --> 27:19.931
What's wrong, were your bib
overalls in the wash tub?

27:20.140 --> 27:22.142
Look what I got on Terrence.

27:22.350 --> 27:26.104
Photos and online profiles
of everyone he clicked
on at SugarDaddio.com.

27:26.313 --> 27:29.065
If there's an "other woman"
who made him kill Taylor,
she could be in here.

27:29.274 --> 27:31.276
It's like a catalog
of skanks.

27:31.484 --> 27:35.113
Oh, take your finger
out of your mouth, sweetie,
that's full of herpes.

27:35.322 --> 27:39.117
Little Miss Jailbait.
"Likes to be pampered."
As in diapers?

27:39.326 --> 27:41.244
Oh, this one reminds
me that I need to
take out the trash...

27:41.453 --> 27:44.789
Meow. Someone has their
acrylic tips out.

27:44.998 --> 27:48.168
I still haven't established
if Terrence had deeper ties
with any of them.

27:48.335 --> 27:49.836
I'm cross-checking
phone numbers.

27:50.003 --> 27:51.630
No, these kind of women
don't need a phone
to call a man.

27:51.838 --> 27:54.633
They just stand upwind
and drop their panties.

27:54.841 --> 27:59.554
Meanwhile, Joe's boss
at Performance Car Stereo
is back from his fishing trip.

27:59.763 --> 28:02.098
If he can ID Terrence
as Joe's mystery client,

28:02.307 --> 28:04.643
we'll be awfully close
to being able to charge him.

28:04.851 --> 28:05.935
Ready to roll?

28:09.898 --> 28:13.026
- Aren't you coming?
- Oh, sorry,
I have an important meeting.

28:13.234 --> 28:15.862
Oh, wait.
I had a vision.

28:16.071 --> 28:17.447
Terrence did it.

28:18.490 --> 28:20.408
- Run with it.
- Liv?

28:21.451 --> 28:22.661
It's a me day.

28:22.869 --> 28:24.245
I am punching out early.

28:24.454 --> 28:25.622
I'm going to see a friend.

28:26.623 --> 28:27.582
You got this.

28:40.512 --> 28:42.347
Hey there, girl!

28:42.555 --> 28:44.224
Whoo!

28:44.432 --> 28:45.684
She's with me.

28:47.852 --> 28:49.354
Look what I found for you.

28:50.980 --> 28:53.358
That is so cute.

28:53.566 --> 28:56.820
I literally want to die,
just so that I can
be buried in it.

28:57.028 --> 28:58.405
Start a tab.

28:58.613 --> 29:00.490
Thank you, Olivia.

29:00.699 --> 29:04.119
Oh, and happy birthday!

29:04.327 --> 29:06.037
It's your birthday?

29:06.246 --> 29:07.330
It must have slipped my mind.

29:07.539 --> 29:09.499
Shut up! We have to celebrate.

29:09.708 --> 29:12.961
How about dinner at that new
seafood and smoothie place,
Fin & Juice?

29:13.169 --> 29:15.046
I love Fin & Juice.

29:15.255 --> 29:17.799
Oh, but where will we ever
find something to wear?

29:27.559 --> 29:28.727
You the manager?

29:28.935 --> 29:29.978
No. Just a second.

29:32.731 --> 29:36.401
Detective Babineaux.
Glad to hear you made it back.
Were the salmon biting?

29:36.609 --> 29:38.737
Oh, I bagged my limit
and then some.

29:40.613 --> 29:41.823
Crap.

29:42.031 --> 29:44.033
Ah, I'm gonna let it slide
this time.

29:44.242 --> 29:46.494
I'm trying to find some
link between Joe and the man
we suspect

29:46.703 --> 29:48.538
hired him to kill
Taylor Fowler.

29:48.747 --> 29:50.540
Your guys told me Joe
had a wealthy client.

29:50.749 --> 29:52.250
One where Joe did all the
work at the customer's place?

29:52.459 --> 29:53.626
Yeah. That's right.

29:53.835 --> 29:55.170
Is this Joe's mystery
customer?

29:56.171 --> 29:57.797
Uh, nope.

29:58.006 --> 29:59.632
You sure?
The photo is a bit old.

29:59.841 --> 30:01.676
Still wouldn't turn him into
an all-pro cornerback

30:01.885 --> 30:03.428
on the local pro
football team, would it?

30:05.138 --> 30:06.973
He was working for a...

30:07.182 --> 30:09.058
Look, it's no surprise
that Joe got mixed up
in something like this.

30:09.267 --> 30:12.061
He met this girl
a few months back.

30:12.270 --> 30:13.646
He just got obsessed
with her.

30:13.855 --> 30:14.898
She had him wrapped
around her finger.

30:15.106 --> 30:16.524
- A girl? You know her name?
- No.

30:16.733 --> 30:18.067
I only saw her once.

30:18.276 --> 30:20.069
I was at the bar
when Joe picked her up.

30:20.278 --> 30:23.072
Although it was more
like she was picking him up.

30:23.281 --> 30:24.574
Was it either of these two?

30:24.783 --> 30:26.910
No, that's too high class.

30:27.118 --> 30:28.870
She had more
of a skank thing going on.

30:31.748 --> 30:34.751
I happen to have a catalog
of skanks out in the car.

30:34.959 --> 30:37.086
Any chance I can get you
to flip through it?

30:37.295 --> 30:39.047
I suppose I could clear
my schedule.

30:42.675 --> 30:44.928
- Do you like it?
- No.

30:45.136 --> 30:47.055
I lurve it.

30:48.181 --> 30:49.808
Your work here is done.

30:50.016 --> 30:51.434
Go. Get selfish.

30:51.643 --> 30:54.062
Find something
that will put the "you"
in fabulous.

30:57.607 --> 31:00.068
<i>Sometimes you
have to move on
from an old friend.</i>

31:00.276 --> 31:03.988
<i>And when you do,
sometimes there's
a new friend waiting.</i>

31:04.197 --> 31:06.157
<i>Someone who helps you see
that in life,</i>

31:06.366 --> 31:07.617
<i>at the end of the day...</i>

31:13.373 --> 31:14.541
- Hello?
<i>- Liv.</i>

31:14.749 --> 31:16.709
I think I know who hired
Joe to kill Taylor.

31:16.876 --> 31:18.711
<i>It was Terrence's
personal stylist, Bethany.</i>

31:24.509 --> 31:27.846
What? How?
I mean, are you sure?

31:28.054 --> 31:31.516
Bethany and Terrence hooked up
through SugarDaddio.com
a year and a half ago.

31:31.724 --> 31:33.601
Only her name was Harmony
back then.

31:33.810 --> 31:36.437
<i>Turns out she also had
Killer Joe wrapped
around her finger.</i>

31:36.646 --> 31:38.606
<i>Liv? Did I lose you?</i>

31:46.906 --> 31:50.201
I can't believe
my BFF Bethany
was a skanky Harmony!

31:50.410 --> 31:52.078
<i>I'm looking
at her right now.</i>

31:52.287 --> 31:54.455
"Hey, big spender,
I'm a girl who loves
to be spoiled."

31:54.664 --> 31:57.750
The manager ID'd her as
Joe's girlfriend from her
picture on SugarDaddio.

31:57.959 --> 31:59.627
<i>That's where she and Terrence
must have connected</i>

31:59.836 --> 32:02.297
before turning her
into Bethany,
his personal stylist.

32:02.505 --> 32:05.300
It would've made it easier
for him to cover all the money
he was spending on her.

32:05.508 --> 32:07.260
<i>The apartment with the view,
the clothes.</i>

32:07.468 --> 32:10.013
Either Bethany seduced Joe
and put him up
to it on her own,

32:10.221 --> 32:11.764
<i>or she was in on it
with Terrence.</i>

32:11.931 --> 32:14.517
I'm gonna bring her in.
Where are you right now?

32:14.726 --> 32:16.436
Um, shopping.

32:18.396 --> 32:21.149
Why are you whispering?

32:21.357 --> 32:23.693
Because I'm in
Hauter Than Hell
with Bethany.

32:23.902 --> 32:24.819
You are? Why?

32:25.028 --> 32:27.739
She's getting me
40% off.

32:27.947 --> 32:30.074
Okay, well, keep her there.
I'll send backup.

32:34.787 --> 32:36.873
Hey, you.

32:37.081 --> 32:38.666
Do me up?

33:07.362 --> 33:09.697
Miss.

33:09.906 --> 33:11.532
We're calling the police.

33:11.741 --> 33:13.034
Just so you know.

33:13.242 --> 33:14.827
I am the police.

33:16.537 --> 33:19.123
Close enough.

33:19.332 --> 33:22.961
Things were pretty sweet
with you and your sugar daddy,
weren't they?

33:23.169 --> 33:26.464
Terrence set you up
with that nice apartment
and all those fine clothes.

33:26.673 --> 33:29.384
But being the next
Mrs. Fowler?

33:29.592 --> 33:31.344
That would've been
even sweeter.

33:34.472 --> 33:35.473
Keep her away from me.

33:35.682 --> 33:36.808
You got off easy. Trust me.

33:39.727 --> 33:41.854
Sorry, Bethany.

33:42.021 --> 33:44.065
So I guess dinner is off?

33:46.150 --> 33:48.903
So was Terrence
taking too long
leaving Taylor?

33:49.112 --> 33:51.656
You started wondering
if all those promises
were just talk,

33:51.864 --> 33:54.033
so you get dimwitted Joe
wrapped around your finger

33:54.242 --> 33:55.660
with promises of love
and money.

33:55.868 --> 33:57.245
You send him
to find some evidence

33:57.453 --> 33:58.955
that Taylor broke
her marriage vows,

33:59.163 --> 34:00.915
with Vaughn Du Clark, no less.

34:01.124 --> 34:02.917
That would've spurred
Terrence into action.

34:03.126 --> 34:05.920
You knew there was
a way to get all your
sugar daddy's money.

34:06.129 --> 34:08.339
You didn't have to lose half
to Taylor in the divorce.

34:08.548 --> 34:10.341
And you wouldn't
if she were dead.

34:10.550 --> 34:12.176
So you talked Joe
into killing her.

34:13.469 --> 34:15.304
- Prove it.
- I don't have to.

34:15.513 --> 34:17.807
Yeah, Bethany.
Or do you prefer "Harmony"?

34:18.016 --> 34:20.184
Or Ivy. Or Miranda.

34:20.393 --> 34:22.437
Or any of your other aliases
in the three states

34:22.645 --> 34:25.523
where you're wanted for...
Let's see.

34:25.732 --> 34:28.276
Fraud, larceny, blackmail.

34:28.484 --> 34:32.030
All involving scams
where you sunk your hooks
into rich, older men

34:32.238 --> 34:33.531
then took their money.

34:33.740 --> 34:35.950
While you're serving time
for those crimes,

34:36.159 --> 34:39.120
we'll find what we need
to keep you in prison
for the rest of your life.

34:39.328 --> 34:42.749
And I'm going to establish
exactly how deeply
Terrence was involved.

34:44.125 --> 34:45.460
Involved with what?

34:46.711 --> 34:48.546
Enjoy prison.

34:50.131 --> 34:52.091
What doesn't orange go with?

34:54.761 --> 34:57.305
Yo, why didn't you answer
any of my texts

34:57.513 --> 34:59.432
about how I was crushing
my date?

34:59.640 --> 35:01.809
Or did you not get my
happy-face-with-a-tongue-
hanging-out emoji?

35:04.312 --> 35:06.981
Hello there, boy.

35:07.190 --> 35:08.107
Uh...

35:09.025 --> 35:10.526
When did we get a...

35:13.154 --> 35:15.323
- Peyton.
- Hey, you.

35:17.408 --> 35:19.494
Uh, this house
is full of surprises.

35:19.702 --> 35:21.746
Will you be revealing
our new robot chef

35:21.954 --> 35:24.749
or should I prepare
my own snack? Mmm?

35:26.334 --> 35:27.794
You should go to bed.

35:28.002 --> 35:29.462
This one needs some sleep.

35:30.755 --> 35:34.008
He's the doctor, but okay.

35:34.217 --> 35:38.346
Ah, I was planning
on going to sleep
tonight anyway.

35:38.554 --> 35:40.807
- So I'm not just doing
it 'cause you said so.
- Right.

35:43.518 --> 35:44.977
I... I don't know
where to start.

35:45.186 --> 35:48.022
Then let me.

35:48.231 --> 35:52.026
I am so sorry
about disappearing like that.

35:52.235 --> 35:53.986
It turns out
"fight or flight"
is a real thing.

35:56.739 --> 36:00.868
I saw something
that made me fly.

36:02.328 --> 36:04.163
I know what you saw.

36:04.372 --> 36:07.333
Granted, my introduction
to the subject
wasn't nearly as violent.

36:07.542 --> 36:10.545
Well, it took me a while
to wrap my head around it all.

36:10.753 --> 36:14.257
Then I got the call to head
the task force, and I realized
it was time to come home.

36:14.465 --> 36:15.508
And here you are.

36:15.716 --> 36:16.592
Yeah.

36:16.801 --> 36:20.721
What about him?
Does he know?

36:20.930 --> 36:23.057
Well, he's still trying
to wrap his head around it.

36:23.266 --> 36:26.185
Ah.
That explains so much.

36:28.729 --> 36:31.023
I wanted to talk to you
in person.

36:31.232 --> 36:32.692
I went straight
from the airport
to the press conference.

36:32.900 --> 36:34.068
This is the first chance
I've had.

36:37.947 --> 36:39.282
Can I just give you a hug?

36:57.425 --> 37:01.137
So you crushed your date
tonight, huh?
Tell me all about it.

37:13.983 --> 37:16.777
Hey, it's your birthday.

37:16.986 --> 37:18.321
Looks like we're having
quite the party.

37:20.114 --> 37:21.407
Massive.

37:22.658 --> 37:24.619
All my friends will be there.

37:32.627 --> 37:35.213
<i>What was I saying back
at the boutique about friends?</i>

37:35.421 --> 37:37.757
<i>Oh, right. Lose one,
find another.</i>

37:40.092 --> 37:41.135
<i>Hello, friend.</i>

37:41.344 --> 37:43.387
<i>Happy birthday to me.</i>

37:43.596 --> 37:45.723
<i>Hey, I should invent
a special cocktail.</i>

37:45.932 --> 37:51.145
<i>One part spicy whiskey,
two parts zombie tears,
a dash of hot sauce.</i>

37:51.354 --> 37:53.231
<i>I'll call it the Liv & Learn.</i>

37:53.439 --> 37:55.650
<i>Because maybe this is the way
it's going to be
from now on.</i>

38:15.086 --> 38:17.797
What the hell?
You didn't tell me
it was your birthday.

38:18.005 --> 38:19.799
Sorry.
I didn't tell anyone.

38:20.007 --> 38:23.010
Kinda makes me wonder
what other secrets
you've been keeping.

38:23.219 --> 38:25.638
- This isn't my natural
hair color.
- No.

38:25.846 --> 38:28.015
So I don't have you to thank
for the birthday cake?

38:28.224 --> 38:29.934
No.

38:30.142 --> 38:32.395
Some chick came by,
waited around for a bit,
but then she had to fly.

38:32.603 --> 38:35.356
Sorry, I use the names
part of my brain
to store body envy.

38:35.564 --> 38:37.525
This girl had several parts
I'd kill for.

38:37.733 --> 38:40.152
And a beauty mark
right where I wanted
to punch her.

38:40.987 --> 38:41.946
Here.

38:45.992 --> 38:47.576
Her name is Peyton.

39:11.392 --> 39:12.518
Hello, Terrence.

39:14.729 --> 39:16.731
It looks like you're holding
a lot of tension there.

39:16.939 --> 39:18.774
No, what I'm holding
are your nards, Du Clark.

39:29.785 --> 39:31.495
I just wanted to see your face
when I told you

39:31.704 --> 39:33.497
I've got the votes
for a hostile takeover.

39:34.248 --> 39:35.791
Oh, okay.

39:37.918 --> 39:39.086
Now what?

39:39.295 --> 39:41.130
I started putting
my ducks in a row

39:41.339 --> 39:43.549
a few weeks ago
when I found out
you were screwing my wife.

39:43.758 --> 39:46.260
With her death,
my private humiliation's
gonna be front page news.

39:46.469 --> 39:48.888
So now it's my turn
to screw you.

39:49.055 --> 39:50.931
At the next board meeting,
when I call for a vote,

39:52.767 --> 39:53.809
your ass is out of here.

39:54.018 --> 39:57.063
Or you could play it smart.

39:57.271 --> 39:58.939
Take the long view.

39:59.148 --> 40:00.775
Set aside our
petty differences,

40:00.983 --> 40:03.110
because at the end of the day,
we both wanted the same thing,

40:03.319 --> 40:05.696
a Gulfstream, our own island,

40:05.905 --> 40:08.032
our face on a stamp... Well,

40:08.240 --> 40:09.283
maybe that last one
was just me.

40:09.492 --> 40:11.660
Max Rager is
this close to illiquid.

40:11.869 --> 40:13.329
The stock just hit
a 52-week low.

40:14.080 --> 40:15.581
We're close.

40:15.748 --> 40:18.167
And I think you'll forget
all this takeover nonsense

40:18.376 --> 40:20.336
once you see
what we've been doing
in this lab.

40:20.544 --> 40:24.215
You are gonna lose
your head, Terr.

40:24.423 --> 40:25.591
I swear.

40:26.675 --> 40:28.219
Then show me.

40:43.275 --> 40:44.944
<i>Thank you,
Mr. Du Clark. Live to the Max.</i>

40:48.656 --> 40:51.033
How many damn sub-levels
do you have?

40:51.242 --> 40:53.536
Officially? None.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.752
Pretty impressive, huh?

41:02.837 --> 41:04.797
This...

41:05.005 --> 41:06.924
...is where the real magic
happens.

41:14.181 --> 41:16.267
What in the world
is that for?

41:16.475 --> 41:19.478
Oh. Science.

41:19.687 --> 41:22.189
Wait right here.
I gotta go find Dr. Holland.

41:22.398 --> 41:24.567
He was always so good
at explaining things.

41:24.775 --> 41:26.652
- Though since
that lab accident...

41:32.908 --> 41:35.119
What does any of this
have to do with Super Max?

41:39.832 --> 41:43.043
Poor Terrence,
always so consumed by work.

41:44.795 --> 41:46.839
Oh, there's Dr. Holland.
