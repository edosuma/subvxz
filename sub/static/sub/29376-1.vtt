00:17.018 --> 00:19.618
        (metal rolling)

00:23.190 --> 00:24.156
        (metal crashing)

00:24.158 --> 00:27.092
       (gentle tinkling)

00:31.432 --> 00:33.799
          (cow mooing)

00:44.712 --> 00:48.580
  (gentle inspirational music)

01:08.569 --> 01:11.336
        (dramatic music)

01:45.339 --> 01:47.139
       - [Alfie] What are
       you doing Louis?

01:47.141 --> 01:50.242
  - [Louis] It's impossible
  to get this rubbish to work.

01:51.145 --> 01:53.245
   This remote doesn't work.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.615
 - [Alife] There, there
 Louis, don't get all excited.

01:57.685 --> 01:59.451
        Now coffee lads.

02:00.721 --> 02:01.854
      - Yes please Alfie.

02:01.856 --> 02:03.722
 You know me, I love me coffee.

02:03.724 --> 02:07.326
  - I've updated the coffee
  machine with microprocessors

02:07.328 --> 02:10.729
 and Java, so now it's the
 quickest in the whole country.

02:10.731 --> 02:14.266
   (coffee machine clanging)

02:14.268 --> 02:16.802
         (Alfie laughs)

02:17.872 --> 02:19.771
       I hope you're good
       and thirsty Luca.

02:20.875 --> 02:22.674
      (bright jazzy music)

02:22.676 --> 02:24.209
        - I love coffee.

02:27.181 --> 02:27.913
           Steady on.

02:39.927 --> 02:43.529
 - That's that then, anything
 else I need to have a look at?

02:43.531 --> 02:45.464
  (television static whirring)

02:45.466 --> 02:48.233
    - This has gone
    completely pear shaped.

02:48.235 --> 02:51.303
       - Nonsense, I'll
       fix it in no time.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.876
         (owl hooting)

02:59.346 --> 03:02.347
    - Shouldn't we er,
    maybe take the plug out?

03:02.349 --> 03:04.483
     - No need for a
     little job like this.

03:04.485 --> 03:07.186
     (electricity jolting)
     (Louis groans)

03:07.188 --> 03:08.453
   - I need to go to the loo.

03:09.590 --> 03:11.223
    - Can't you just manage
    by yourself for once?

03:11.225 --> 03:13.659
  - But it's so dark outside.

03:13.661 --> 03:14.893
     - Well you should have
     thought about that

03:14.895 --> 03:17.229
     before drinking all
     the coffee in Brazil.

03:25.606 --> 03:28.507
       - It's all right
       lads, don't worry,

03:28.509 --> 03:30.209
 nature's turned the lights on.

03:31.612 --> 03:35.647
 - Here is the news that I feel
 is the most important today.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.983
    - Look it's easy as pie.

03:37.985 --> 03:43.255
     (electricity jolting)
     (Louis yells)

03:51.665 --> 03:52.664
       - Thank you Moon.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.569
   - Which also includes
   the provision that no one

03:57.571 --> 03:59.738
    in the government is
    permitted to ride a cow,

03:59.740 --> 04:01.440
          ever again.

04:01.442 --> 04:02.908
  And we're going to the Moon.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.943
    - Oh yeah, do you
    remember when you tried

04:04.945 --> 04:07.546
    to fool the newspaper
    about going to the Moon?

04:07.548 --> 04:10.015
   - Yes, it would have
   worked too if Luca's head

04:10.017 --> 04:11.450
   hadn't got in the picture.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.321
       - And it's been 50
       years since the UN

04:16.322 --> 04:18.457
     adopted the resolution
     that no country

04:18.459 --> 04:19.925
       can own the Moon.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.628
  The resolution has passed
  it's statute of limitations.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.363
       - Statute of what?

04:24.365 --> 04:26.465
      - It means it's past
      it's expiry date,

04:26.467 --> 04:28.734
  like that sour milk you had
  for breakfast this morning.

04:28.736 --> 04:31.937
     - Oh don't remind me,
     that tasted awful.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.806
 - Three months for a new
 resolution to go into effect,

04:34.808 --> 04:37.709
      and in the meantime
      it's up for grabs.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.745
   Whichever country manages
   to build a rocket,

04:39.747 --> 04:42.547
      fly up there and
      plant a flag first,

04:42.549 --> 04:46.518
 that country will be the sole
 owner of the entire Moon.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.320
       - The entire Moon.

04:48.322 --> 04:50.289
      - Hmm, we could try
      building a rocket.

04:50.291 --> 04:52.791
     - But how could
     anybody own the Moon?

04:52.793 --> 04:55.560
     - And it appears
     Norway is interested.

04:55.562 --> 04:57.763
      Welcome to my show,
      isn't that so,

04:57.765 --> 05:00.766
head of Norway's newly founded,
Government Space Program,

05:00.768 --> 05:02.668
        Vigfus Skonken.

05:02.670 --> 05:05.637
      - Oh yes, Norwegians
      have always explored

05:05.639 --> 05:08.874
 and even conquered land, like
 the South Pole for instance

05:08.876 --> 05:10.909
 by Hansen, Nansen and Alensen.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.444
     - I'm the only one
     who's allowed to look

05:12.446 --> 05:14.313
   directly into the camera.

05:14.315 --> 05:16.381
But Norway has no time to lose,

05:16.383 --> 05:18.717
      other countries are
      also in the race.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.952
    We've obtained
    exclusive secret images

05:20.954 --> 05:22.888
     smuggled from a
     rocket base in Russia

05:22.890 --> 05:24.690
displaying a promising trial run

05:24.692 --> 05:27.092
       for the so called
       Matryoshka Rocket.

05:27.094 --> 05:30.562
     (upbeat Russian music)

05:33.801 --> 05:34.966
         - [Male] Niet!

05:34.968 --> 05:36.401
      - We have also been
      informed that even

05:36.403 --> 05:37.936
      the United States of
      America has resumed

05:37.938 --> 05:40.339
       it's space program
       after many years.

05:40.341 --> 05:44.076
  - [Male] Houston we've got
  a problem, a really big one.

05:44.078 --> 05:45.010
          Don't move.

05:46.547 --> 05:47.746
        - [Male] Sorry.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.481
      - All they need is
      for their astronauts

05:49.483 --> 05:50.849
      to lose some weight.

05:52.086 --> 05:54.686
   But honestly Skonken there
   really isn't any hope

05:54.688 --> 05:56.621
     that Norway will
     stand a chance in this

05:56.623 --> 05:58.657
highly technological space race.

05:58.658 --> 06:00.692
 - I'd have to disagree, don't
 forget that it's typically

06:00.694 --> 06:02.961
 Norwegian to be um Norwegian.

06:04.398 --> 06:07.599
   And do you know Norwegians
   do astoundingly well,

06:07.601 --> 06:10.035
  some of the sharpest brains
  in the world are in Norway.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.537
   And the government thinks
   that the Moon landing

06:12.539 --> 06:14.506
    can become Norway's new

06:16.844 --> 06:18.110
         Moon landing.

06:18.112 --> 06:19.845
  - Don't look into my camera.

06:19.847 --> 06:21.513
  And now over to the weather.

06:22.149 --> 06:25.584
        (goat bleating)

06:25.586 --> 06:28.587
     - Why can't they
     leave the Moon alone?

06:28.589 --> 06:31.923
  - Well it won't be the first
  time people were up there.

06:33.160 --> 06:36.995
  - No it won't be, and it
  hasn't been the same since.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.431
    - Oh I've been dreaming
    about Moon rockets

06:39.433 --> 06:41.600
     since I was knee high
     to a grasshopper.

06:43.670 --> 06:46.471
   How would you fancy a trip
   to the Moon Louis hey?

06:48.709 --> 06:50.008
             Louis?

06:50.010 --> 06:52.744
         (door closing)

06:56.150 --> 06:58.483
        - [Luca] Is that
        a goldfish bowl?

06:58.485 --> 06:59.551
             - Shh.

06:59.553 --> 07:02.821
     I need to study the
     surface, and remember

07:02.823 --> 07:05.757
 where there are lunar craters
 so as not to fall into them.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.726
- You're really going up there?

07:07.728 --> 07:10.162
- The first magpie on the Moon.

07:10.164 --> 07:13.165
    For real this time, not
    just in the newspaper.

07:13.167 --> 07:16.101
 Everyone thought I was a
 wally and called it fake news.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.703
    But now I'll show them.

07:18.705 --> 07:22.140
 - I think a little trip to
 the workshop might be in order

07:22.142 --> 07:23.742
           you know.

07:23.744 --> 07:26.645
  - Now what I need to do is
  go and find some seed money.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.079
      - But Louis, what
      about all the things

07:28.081 --> 07:29.648
      that could go wrong?

07:29.650 --> 07:31.049
    - That can be your job.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.051
     - Well I suppose
     that is my specialty.

07:34.855 --> 07:37.923
      Right, where's the
      goldfish by the way?

07:37.925 --> 07:39.758
          - It's safe.
          - Right.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.927
      - Just er, don't use
      the potty tonight.

07:43.230 --> 07:46.631
     (inspirational music)

07:59.947 --> 08:02.848
        (birds chirping)

08:10.691 --> 08:15.727
        - Louis, Alfie!

08:16.497 --> 08:18.630
       (distant banging)

08:18.632 --> 08:21.800
      Hmm, I wonder what's
      going on in there?

08:21.802 --> 08:24.636
        (Alfie mumbling)

08:26.707 --> 08:28.106
     (electricity jolting)
     - No, no, no, no

08:28.108 --> 08:29.274
    that does not go there.

08:32.645 --> 08:34.679
     - What you doing?
     - Wait a second Luca.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.982
   I'm in the process of
   doing some precision work

08:36.984 --> 08:39.083
  that requires full concen--

08:39.086 --> 08:41.553
       (Louis yells)
       (metal clattering)

08:41.554 --> 08:43.554
     - [Mayor] Oh no sorry.

08:43.557 --> 08:46.258
  - [Louis] Don't worry I was
  gonna buy a new one anyway.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.093
  - [Mayor] Where am I going?

08:48.095 --> 08:49.794
    - [Louis] It's this way,

08:49.796 --> 08:51.963
       it's important to
       record the process

08:51.965 --> 08:54.533
 and the visiting celebrities.

08:54.535 --> 08:58.236
This is the stuff documentaries
and film awards are made of.

08:58.238 --> 09:02.941
 - Good day, good day, my name
 is Widow Stengen Von Glad,

09:02.943 --> 09:07.012
   Lord Mayor of Flaklypa
   for the Centurist Social,

09:07.014 --> 09:09.581
 Labour and Conservative Party.

09:10.918 --> 09:14.185
     Yes, the space program
     is so important

09:14.187 --> 09:17.188
  that the Lord Mayor herself
  is here for a visit.

09:18.625 --> 09:21.226
 - And the city council has
 already pledged their support.

09:21.228 --> 09:25.697
    Don't be shy now Alfie,
    let's see this rocket.

09:25.699 --> 09:28.567
        (dramatic music)

09:30.070 --> 09:32.170
     - Well it's not quite
     finished yet you know,

09:32.172 --> 09:36.241
    but here you have before
    you the La Pollo 0,

09:36.243 --> 09:38.209
    hand polished profiles,

09:38.211 --> 09:39.978
       optimized for low
        air resistance.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.981
High RPM and medium fire hazard.

09:44.184 --> 09:47.686
- Isn't your rocket a tad tiny?

09:47.688 --> 09:51.623
     - Uh no, the first
     tests are small scale.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.792
      When we've completed
      those we launch it

09:53.794 --> 09:55.794
    into the stratosphere
    and then it will be time

09:55.796 --> 09:58.063
to build the actual Moon rocket.

09:58.065 --> 09:58.997
        - Stratosphere?

10:00.033 --> 10:01.800
   Sounds like a scary place.

10:01.802 --> 10:05.770
       - So do we have a
       party pooper here.

10:05.772 --> 10:09.107
      Oh it's wise to be
      careful at the start

10:09.109 --> 10:12.911
    but don't let the
    naysayers run the show.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.245
  It's all about perspective!

10:15.382 --> 10:16.781
        - Oh be careful.

10:16.783 --> 10:19.150
    - There are times when
    we need to forget about

10:19.152 --> 10:22.387
      what might go wrong
      and say yes we can.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.724
         - [Alfie] No!

10:25.726 --> 10:29.761
       (dramatic music)
       (rocket whirring)

10:29.763 --> 10:30.996
       - What on Earth
       is wrong with it?

10:30.998 --> 10:32.697
    - It's not finished yet.

10:33.700 --> 10:34.633
   - Run for cover everyone.

10:37.938 --> 10:39.204
        Watch out Luca!

10:41.241 --> 10:42.273
        - Give me that.

10:59.359 --> 11:03.328
   - (laughs) Look at it go.

11:03.330 --> 11:06.231
     - Well it's
     impossible to control.

11:09.002 --> 11:09.934
            - Oh no!

11:18.445 --> 11:20.945
      - I'm not an expert
      but aren't rockets

11:20.947 --> 11:22.247
       supposed to go up?

11:22.249 --> 11:23.882
       - Where did it go?

11:23.884 --> 11:25.216
        - I don't know.

11:25.218 --> 11:28.153
       (rocket whirring)

11:29.456 --> 11:31.823
    - I think I'll just nip
    in here for a minute.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.771
    - Sounds like it's okay.

11:46.773 --> 11:50.909
       (rocket explodes)
       (Alfie groans)

11:50.911 --> 11:52.944
      - [Luca] Is it safe
      to come out now?

11:56.083 --> 11:58.483
          (Luca gasps)

12:07.160 --> 12:09.928
        (wood creaking)

12:11.031 --> 12:13.431
    - Now then when are you
    going to start working

12:13.433 --> 12:15.166
     on the actual rocket?

12:16.436 --> 12:19.003
   - Never, it's over, this
   is the end of everything.

12:19.005 --> 12:20.305
  Everything we've worked for,

12:20.307 --> 12:23.208
 the entire space race project.

12:23.210 --> 12:24.976
        - But why Alfie?

12:24.978 --> 12:27.512
     - The test was a
     complete catastrophe,

12:28.749 --> 12:30.215
      we can't even
      afford to continue.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.952
    - Well that's why the
    Lord mayor is here hey.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.154
        We'll be back on
        track in no time

12:36.156 --> 12:38.523
   thanks to the council
   and the regional funding.

12:38.525 --> 12:42.327
    - Oh well, er, the
    council has gone through

12:42.329 --> 12:44.529
  an expensive restructuring.

12:44.531 --> 12:47.198
    Executive salaries
    have never been higher.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.300
    - But you said we could
    count on your support.

12:49.302 --> 12:53.972
 - But yes of course, you have
 all of our moral support.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.273
     - Your moral support?

12:55.275 --> 12:57.942
      - Oh yes, there's
      no shortage of that.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.778
      Just let us know if
      you need anymore,

12:59.780 --> 13:01.980
      more morals I mean.

13:03.950 --> 13:07.218
      - Aye, well it was
      fun while it lasted.

13:07.220 --> 13:10.021
  But you're never going to do
  a Moon walk are you Louis?

13:10.023 --> 13:11.289
        Not now anyway.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.526
      - It's probably
      just as well Louis,

13:14.528 --> 13:18.196
  you can walk around all you
  like down here on Earth.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.131
    - We can't give up now.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.066
      - Yes, we have too,

13:22.068 --> 13:24.135
because our little space program

13:24.137 --> 13:27.238
       has been a total
       and utter fiasco.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.439
   - [Luca] Been one of them.

13:28.441 --> 13:31.843
       - Fiasco, that
       word doesn't exist

13:31.845 --> 13:33.444
in Louis Gunderson's dictionary.

13:33.446 --> 13:37.448
  I'm going to the Moon, even
  if it's the last thing I do.

13:38.952 --> 13:41.486
         (gentle music)

13:45.525 --> 13:49.060
   (coffee machine creaking)

13:49.062 --> 13:52.564
   - We don't need the worlds
   quickest coffee machine,

13:52.566 --> 13:54.899
       seeing as how slow
       it is round here.

13:56.570 --> 13:58.436
     - Aren't you gonna
     watch the news Alfie,

13:58.438 --> 14:00.338
     we should maybe check
     up on the space race?

14:00.340 --> 14:01.272
             - Nah.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.842
   - Well I'm gonna watch it.

14:04.578 --> 14:08.046
    (gentle tinkling music)

14:08.048 --> 14:10.515
    - Here is the latest on
    the race to the Moon.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.084
   - Weird all they keep
   talking about on the news

14:13.086 --> 14:15.053
          is the Moon.
          - Shh.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.588
   - Rockets are being
   built all over the world.

14:16.590 --> 14:20.158
  According to our sources
  most of them have problems.

14:20.160 --> 14:23.194
    The EUs attempt has
    been a terrible failure.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.630
    They put the Italians in
    charge of organization,

14:25.632 --> 14:28.633
 the Germans of ornamentation,
 the Greeks of finance,

14:28.635 --> 14:32.070
   and the British Brexited
   before they even started.

14:32.072 --> 14:35.340
     And finally we've been
     told in breaking news,

14:35.342 --> 14:37.175
     the French have taken
     it upon themselves

14:37.177 --> 14:42.247
to completely revamp the launch
pad for no apparent reason.

14:43.283 --> 14:44.916
     This is why there were
     great hopes placed

14:44.918 --> 14:46.951
      on another contender
      in the space race.

14:46.953 --> 14:49.354
      An individual
      called Alfie Clarke,

14:49.356 --> 14:52.657
  an initial test launch took
  place earlier this week.

14:52.659 --> 14:55.126
- How did they hear about that?

14:55.128 --> 14:56.561
        - I don't know.

14:56.563 --> 14:59.230
   - [Reporter] According to
   astronaut Bluka Gunderson,

14:59.232 --> 15:03.268
    in a somewhat unreadable
    press release.

15:03.270 --> 15:05.270
   - No such thing as bad PR.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.671
    - It's a good thing they
    don't have any pictures

15:06.673 --> 15:08.273
        of the disaster.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.675
   - Bluka Gunderson has also
   provided us with footage

15:10.677 --> 15:12.977
      of the test launch.

15:12.979 --> 15:15.280
            - Louis?

15:15.281 --> 15:17.582
 - Unlike the others happened
 to be surprisingly successful.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.267
             - Hey?

15:19.268 --> 15:20.951
 - [Reporter] The commentary
 here is by Gunderson himself.

15:20.954 --> 15:25.123
- [Louis] As we can see La
Pollo 0 is a model with positive

15:25.125 --> 15:28.660
     entry points, and
     explosive exit points.

15:28.662 --> 15:32.263
    This being said, it can
    be maneuvered indoors.

15:32.265 --> 15:35.566
   This tiny model quickly
   reaches impressive heights

15:35.568 --> 15:38.036
    and controlled landings
    on the launchpad

15:38.038 --> 15:41.472
   have been executed without
   any problems whatsoever.

15:44.577 --> 15:47.946
    - And joining us by
    phone is Vigfus Skonken

15:47.948 --> 15:50.448
  Head of Norway's
  governmental space program.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.017
    We hear you already have
    more funding in place

15:53.019 --> 15:54.252
       for Alfie Clarke.

15:54.254 --> 15:57.322
     - That's right, hello,
     hello, are you there?

15:57.324 --> 15:59.157
  Oh there you are, yes okay,

15:59.159 --> 16:00.591
       the government is
       about to announce

16:00.593 --> 16:03.027
this great news to Alfie Clarke.

16:03.029 --> 16:04.562
    - Come on, in here hey.

16:04.564 --> 16:08.166
   - It looks as though it's
   coming together nicely.

16:08.168 --> 16:11.069
      And now we'll go
      over to the Lottery.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.572
     - I am Vigfus Skonken.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.007
      - Right my name is--

16:16.009 --> 16:17.976
      - The man that will
      get us to the Moon.

16:19.612 --> 16:21.746
  And the government will pay.

16:21.748 --> 16:25.483
   - But the test launch
   didn't go quite as well--

16:25.485 --> 16:28.019
      - Don't be bothering
      Vigfus with this.

16:28.021 --> 16:30.021
 I can smell the Moon already.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.657
      - Er, I think that
      might have been me.

16:33.560 --> 16:35.193
   - But it isn't that easy.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.195
      I mean we don't even
      have a launchpad.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.564
       - We're working
       on that presently.

16:39.566 --> 16:42.266
  - What about the materials
  needed to build the rocket?

16:42.268 --> 16:43.601
    - This is just perfect.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.771
      - And the workshop
      needs to be rebuilt.

16:46.773 --> 16:48.639
     - Ready when you are.

16:48.641 --> 16:52.243
 - What about fuel, I doubt
 that Flaklypa service stations

16:52.245 --> 16:55.480
  have 14,000 liters of double
  distilled high octane.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.548
      - No, but we have
      hundreds of oil rigs

16:57.550 --> 16:59.283
       that can help out.

16:59.285 --> 17:01.185
     We will do everything
     in our power

17:01.187 --> 17:03.688
     to launch this rocket
     as soon as possible,

17:03.690 --> 17:05.289
        with me onboard.

17:05.290 --> 17:06.523
          - Huh, you?

17:07.460 --> 17:09.292
You're going to be an astronaut?

17:09.295 --> 17:11.029
       - Aren't you just
       an administrator?

17:11.031 --> 17:12.396
            - Just?

17:12.398 --> 17:14.799
   Look here, since Norway's
   going to own the Moon

17:14.800 --> 17:17.734
  a government official needs
  to set foot on the ground.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.604
       - Looks like it's
       you and me then.

17:19.606 --> 17:21.204
             - Yes.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.574
  - Seems like the government
  has it all under control.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.476
       - Seems like we're
       off to the Moon.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.578
    - Yeah, looks that way.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.515
- This is an Insta moment Luca.

17:32.318 --> 17:33.651
        - Just a minute.

17:36.790 --> 17:38.723
      Go on get in Louis,
      right say cheers.

17:40.827 --> 17:44.796
      - I Think this calls
      for a celebration.

17:44.798 --> 17:46.397
       - I thought the
       council was broke.

17:46.399 --> 17:50.134
  - Huh, really, what ever
  made you think such a thing?

17:50.136 --> 17:52.537
 You're paying for this right?

17:52.539 --> 17:53.771
           - Uh huh.

17:53.773 --> 17:56.140
      - Bubbles all round,
      now let's celebrate.

17:56.142 --> 17:58.176
 I'll just put it on your bill.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.711
         (upbeat music)

18:39.185 --> 18:42.186
       (machine whirring)

18:51.364 --> 18:53.831
         (Luca groans)

18:55.468 --> 18:58.269
        (rocket firing)

19:15.755 --> 19:18.623
        (dramatic music)

19:37.610 --> 19:38.876
    - Come on it's starting.

19:38.878 --> 19:39.810
           - Oh yes.

19:48.755 --> 19:52.690
    - I'm not interested in
    watching space travel.

19:53.826 --> 19:57.495
    - Come here, Flaklypa's
    on the television.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.297
  - What a load of poppycock,

19:59.299 --> 20:01.732
  Alfie Clarke's Moon rocket.

20:01.734 --> 20:02.900
  Huh, what's that compared to

20:02.902 --> 20:04.302
       Oliver Clifford's
       cheese fountain

20:04.304 --> 20:06.370
     for birthday parties,
     and conferences.

20:08.641 --> 20:09.774
           (mumbling)

20:09.776 --> 20:11.609
      - None of the
      seats are reserved.

20:12.445 --> 20:13.311
           (screams)

20:13.313 --> 20:16.247
    (gentle tinkling music)

20:16.249 --> 20:18.416
     - This is so exciting.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.652
           (snoring)

20:20.653 --> 20:22.887
 - And so my avid viewers
 tomorrow is the rocket launch

20:22.889 --> 20:24.889
       at Cape Flaklypa.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.757
   And for the latest
   breaking news on the event

20:26.759 --> 20:28.826
    we go live to our
    reporter on the ground,

20:28.828 --> 20:30.428
       Frederick Hansen.

20:30.430 --> 20:35.233
  - Hello, and welcome, News
  Editor Frederick Hansen here

20:36.302 --> 20:39.570
       to report directly
       from Cape Flaklypa

20:39.572 --> 20:40.671
            - What?

20:40.673 --> 20:42.773
    I'm the only one
    supposed to have a desk.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.642
    Reporters aren't
    supposed to have desks.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.611
       - Well I can't
       hear you properly,

20:46.613 --> 20:49.480
   the connection is bad,
   but I'm sure you asked me

20:49.482 --> 20:51.849
    what it's like for an
    experienced news editor

20:51.851 --> 20:53.951
such as me to host this program.

20:53.953 --> 20:56.320
- No, I most certainly did not.

20:56.322 --> 20:59.857
  - A program such as this
  provides us with excitement,

20:59.859 --> 21:04.795
tension, explosions,
astronauts flying as fire balls

21:04.797 --> 21:06.831
     through the atmosphere
     on their way toward

21:06.833 --> 21:08.599
        a certain death.

21:08.601 --> 21:09.500
             - Oy!

21:10.670 --> 21:13.537
    - And here is the man
    responsible for it all,

21:13.539 --> 21:16.440
     Alfie Clarke, welcome.
     - Er.

21:16.442 --> 21:19.577
    - And the charming
    Madam Mayor of Flaklypa,

21:19.579 --> 21:20.878
        Stengelfohn-Glad

21:20.880 --> 21:24.048
     - Er it's Lord Mayor,
     but I'll let it pass.

21:24.050 --> 21:26.851
        (romantic music)
        (giggles)

21:26.853 --> 21:31.422
 - Quite, so how is it possible
 to have a rocket launch

21:31.424 --> 21:33.758
      in little Flaklypa.

21:33.760 --> 21:34.892
   - Well it's quite simple--

21:34.894 --> 21:37.561
     - Everything is
     possible in Flaklypa.

21:38.865 --> 21:41.399
   You wouldn't believe what
   we have accomplished here.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.868
    - Yes well, indeed,
    why don't we start here

21:43.870 --> 21:45.803
     in the control center.

21:46.906 --> 21:48.939
       This we would call
       mission control.

21:48.941 --> 21:51.909
    Most everything here is
    standard space equipment

21:51.911 --> 21:53.678
according to the tamburg model,

21:53.680 --> 21:57.548
     closely tested using
     the on a whim method.

21:57.550 --> 22:00.518
    The rocket is controlled
    from the ground

22:00.520 --> 22:03.354
 to ensure resting regulations,

22:03.356 --> 22:04.889
        and in case they
        become car sick.

22:04.891 --> 22:06.791
      I mean rocket sick.

22:06.793 --> 22:08.359
         - How clever.

22:08.361 --> 22:10.594
    - We'll be communicating
    on this system

22:10.596 --> 22:11.862
    via analog frequencies.

22:13.066 --> 22:14.065
       We have it all to
       ourselves now that

22:14.067 --> 22:16.501
   everything's gone digital,

22:16.502 --> 22:18.936
 and naturally there is a
 designated area for relaxation

22:18.938 --> 22:22.039
    and contemplation,
    complete with dispensers

22:22.041 --> 22:24.809
 for red and white grape juice,

22:24.811 --> 22:28.079
     and assorted tins with
     various refreshments.

22:28.081 --> 22:29.814
 Naturally recycled materials,

22:29.816 --> 22:31.615
    all very environmentally
    friendly.

22:33.086 --> 22:34.685
         (Mayor yells)

22:34.687 --> 22:37.121
    Well it looks as if the
    Lord Mayor has a fancy

22:37.123 --> 22:38.689
  for that particular detail.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.459
  - Well you have to practice
  what you preach I say.

22:41.461 --> 22:43.394
      (Frederick mumbles)

22:43.396 --> 22:44.929
      - And here we have
      a machine that beeps

22:44.931 --> 22:46.964
     as long as everything
     is doing well.

22:46.966 --> 22:50.000
 These gauges are for measuring
 fuel and oxygen levels,

22:50.002 --> 22:52.536
     as well as weather
     conditions, stability,

22:52.538 --> 22:54.505
       and excess weight.

22:54.506 --> 22:56.473
 - Hmm, and what type of cargo
 are you bringing to the Moon?

22:56.476 --> 22:57.808
     - That's the
     governments business,

22:57.810 --> 23:00.678
      I'm merely in charge
      of transportation.

23:00.680 --> 23:04.548
      - Transportation,
      (laughs maniacally)

23:04.550 --> 23:08.886
  Emanuel, fetch the largest
  cheese in the storage room.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.488
       (Emanuel mumbles)

23:10.490 --> 23:13.090
 Can you imagine how much
 people would be willing to pay

23:13.092 --> 23:15.593
       for cheese that's
       been to the Moon.

23:15.595 --> 23:19.663
     - Yeah, I mean who
     are they to disabrie?

23:19.665 --> 23:22.500
            (laughs)

23:22.502 --> 23:24.168
       Get it, disabrie.

23:24.170 --> 23:26.637
     - Well that would be
     a bit cheesy (laughs).

23:31.110 --> 23:34.412
       Hey, I said go
       fetch that cheese.

23:35.782 --> 23:39.016
 - Um, as you can see the mood
 for the day before take off

23:39.018 --> 23:40.885
       is rather cheery.

23:40.887 --> 23:44.555
      - Oh yes, we're all
      very cheerful here.

23:44.557 --> 23:45.923
             Rose.

23:45.925 --> 23:46.857
           - Cheers.
           - Cheers.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.839
 - Well you'll be off tomorrow?

24:01.841 --> 24:06.177
 - Yeah but we'll keep in touch
 by radio the entire time.

24:06.179 --> 24:08.913
      And we'll be back
      before you know it.

24:08.915 --> 24:11.115
       - Promise you'll
       come back though?

24:12.185 --> 24:15.019
      - Of course, I'm not
      leaving you Luca.

24:15.021 --> 24:18.055
    We're gonna be mates for
    the rest of our lives.

24:18.057 --> 24:20.558
      - Well how can you
      be so sure about it?

24:24.464 --> 24:28.899
   - See this glass jar, I'll
   fill it up with Moon dust

24:28.901 --> 24:31.669
       and then bring it
       home just for you.

24:31.671 --> 24:33.821
            - Yeah.

24:33.822 --> 24:35.972
- And in order to keep my
promise of giving you Moon dust

24:35.975 --> 24:38.476
   I have to return don't I?

24:38.478 --> 24:42.146
    - Okay, but just be
    careful Louis all right.

24:42.148 --> 24:44.582
       - Look Alfie built
       the rocket yeah,

24:44.584 --> 24:48.118
 I'm at the controls, I mean
 what could possibly go wrong?

24:54.660 --> 24:57.928
     (tense dramatic music)

25:01.167 --> 25:04.568
     (gentle bright music)

25:06.105 --> 25:08.205
      - Oh yeah, it's
      starting soon, yeah.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.509
           (snoring)

25:27.827 --> 25:29.560
            (groans)

25:29.562 --> 25:30.961
    (bright tinkling music)

25:30.963 --> 25:32.730
 - The day has finally arrived.

25:32.732 --> 25:35.065
    A Norwegian rocket will
    be sent to the Moon,

25:35.067 --> 25:37.234
     Norway is in the lead
     of the space race now,

25:37.236 --> 25:40.838
     the Moon could
     actually be Norwegian.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.006
           This is--

25:42.007 --> 25:43.173
    - I have to interrupt
    that boring introduction

25:43.175 --> 25:44.608
  that didn't even mention me.

25:44.610 --> 25:47.845
   Here come the astronauts.

25:47.847 --> 25:51.849
 (dramatic inspirational music)

26:00.793 --> 26:05.863
 - Whoops, well if you insist.

26:20.613 --> 26:24.615
   - Hey up, Louis, the jar!

26:27.887 --> 26:32.957
 - Today my friends, today
 they aren't just two men who,

26:34.026 --> 26:37.328
    well yes they actually
    aren't in fact two men.

26:37.330 --> 26:40.931
We have one man and one magpie.

26:40.933 --> 26:45.135
      Today it isn't just
      a man and a magpie

26:45.137 --> 26:46.870
   who are going to the Moon,

26:48.074 --> 26:51.709
      because they
      represent all of us.

26:52.945 --> 26:57.848
  La Pollo has a little bit of
  all of us on that journey.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.317
    - Never mind that, is it
      time for lunch hey?

27:02.188 --> 27:06.056
  (dramatic suspenseful music)

27:11.631 --> 27:14.965
   - Louis to Alfie, we are
   now in the control module.

27:16.235 --> 27:18.936
  - Great, prepare for systems
  checks before take off.

27:18.938 --> 27:21.805
     - Roger, I mean Alfie.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.778
   - Check the gyrostabilizer
   to counteract gravity

27:27.780 --> 27:28.712
         and vomiting.

27:32.818 --> 27:33.784
            - Check.
            - Check.

27:34.820 --> 27:36.320
      - [Alfie] Check
      rocket brake system.

27:38.090 --> 27:40.057
            - Check.
            - Check.

27:40.059 --> 27:42.660
 - [Alfie] Check payment method
 in case of crash landing

27:42.662 --> 27:44.128
     in a foreign country.

27:44.130 --> 27:45.996
       - Travelers check.
       - Check.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.331
  - [Alfie] Check fuel level.

27:49.735 --> 27:52.202
       - Full, as a bloke
       on Christmas day.

27:52.204 --> 27:53.871
        - Check, check.

27:53.873 --> 27:56.073
  - Run procedure for
  checking the aluminum hull.

27:56.075 --> 27:57.141
        (metal banging)

27:57.143 --> 27:58.008
            - Check.

27:58.010 --> 28:00.461
            - Check.
            - Check.

28:00.462 --> 28:02.913
 - Hang about, Louis you forgot
 the jar for the Moon dust.

28:02.915 --> 28:05.416
  - [Alfie] Check machine that
  goes beep to ensure that all

28:05.418 --> 28:06.717
        systems are go.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.119
            - Check.
            - Check.

28:09.955 --> 28:11.121
       - [Alfie] Oxygen.

28:11.123 --> 28:13.757
      - Enough to the
      Moon and back again.

28:13.759 --> 28:15.259
   - [Alfie] Seal the hatch.

28:15.261 --> 28:16.727
    - Sealing the hatch now.

28:23.969 --> 28:25.169
            - Hello?

28:25.171 --> 28:26.937
     - All systems are go.

28:26.939 --> 28:30.074
    - [Alfie] Then sit back
    and start the engines,

28:30.076 --> 28:31.709
 and we'll commence countdown.

28:34.080 --> 28:37.014
       (engine chugging)

28:40.720 --> 28:43.187
- There, can you feel it Melvin?

28:43.189 --> 28:47.891
  The magnitude of space, the
  yearning for the unknown?

28:47.893 --> 28:49.927
       - Yeah, yeah, yeah
       I'm feeling it.

28:50.730 --> 28:52.930
       Oh I need the loo.

28:52.932 --> 28:54.431
    - Can't you hold it in?

28:54.433 --> 28:58.869
 - [Louis] All systems are a go
 as they say across the pond.

28:58.871 --> 29:01.305
      - Commence automatic
      start sequence.

29:01.307 --> 29:04.174
Take off in T-minus two minutes.

29:04.176 --> 29:06.477
 - Oh yes, tea would be lovely.

29:06.479 --> 29:08.445
     - No that means that
     the rocket will launch

29:08.447 --> 29:09.847
        in two minutes.

29:09.849 --> 29:14.017
      - Yes, yes, it's all
      very, very exciting.

29:15.221 --> 29:18.155
      - Perhaps you and
      Luca could step out.

29:18.157 --> 29:20.174
            - Luca?

29:20.175 --> 29:22.192
 Last time I saw him he was
 hitching a ride on the rocket.

29:23.963 --> 29:24.962
            - What?

29:24.964 --> 29:26.463
      - Is that a problem?

29:27.767 --> 29:30.100
     - [Alfie] Louis check
     the lifeform detector.

29:32.004 --> 29:35.839
        (radar beeping)
        - What?

29:35.841 --> 29:37.875
    (Luca breathing heavily)

29:37.877 --> 29:41.945
   There is something
   moving in the cargo hold.

29:41.947 --> 29:47.017
- Just as I suspected, okay
we'll have to abort the mission.

29:48.888 --> 29:51.321
 - Are we on the Moon already?

29:59.465 --> 30:01.198
  - Ah, now we're ready Vigfus

30:03.502 --> 30:06.370
     - Will this jeopardize
     the Moon landing?

30:06.372 --> 30:10.908
   - Oh no, Luca brought me
   something very important.

30:13.913 --> 30:16.046
     Alfie we're ready now.

30:16.048 --> 30:17.481
 - Right, we'll try that again.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.817
Let's pick up where we left off.

30:19.819 --> 30:23.487
       T-minus one minute
       and 26 seconds.

30:23.489 --> 30:24.855
       - Is it tea time?

30:24.857 --> 30:27.825
    - No it means that's
    the length of time left

30:27.827 --> 30:29.326
 until the rocket is launched.

30:29.328 --> 30:31.295
 Urgh, don't you know anything.

30:31.297 --> 30:33.831
      - Louis, disconnect
      the fuel intake.

30:36.202 --> 30:40.304
     - [Mayor] T-minus one
     minute and 11 seconds.

30:40.306 --> 30:41.505
             - 11.

30:41.507 --> 30:42.906
       - [Alfie] Maximize
       the fuel pressure.

30:42.908 --> 30:44.408
     - Maximizing pressure.

30:44.410 --> 30:46.243
      - [Mayor] One
      minute to lift off.

30:47.346 --> 30:50.080
    - In one minute Norway
    will be making history,

30:50.082 --> 30:51.381
       Frederick Hansen?

30:51.383 --> 30:53.183
- I'm in the middle of blogging.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.519
    Can't a reporter even
    write an emotional blog

30:55.521 --> 30:58.021
  about space exploration now.

30:58.023 --> 31:00.991
     Let's see, how do
     you spell death trap?

31:02.895 --> 31:05.329
  - [Alfie] Transfer from
  external to internal power.

31:05.331 --> 31:07.331
 - Terminating external power.

31:08.167 --> 31:11.969
  (bright inspirational music)

31:25.417 --> 31:28.085
      Transfer to internal
      power complete.

31:28.087 --> 31:30.254
- Splendid, sit back and relax,

31:30.256 --> 31:32.289
and I will take over from here.

31:32.291 --> 31:34.258
     - T-minus 30 seconds.

31:34.260 --> 31:35.993
   - We're going to be rich.

31:44.303 --> 31:49.139
 - Count down from 20, 19, 18,

31:50.376 --> 31:54.311
 17, where are you off to now?

31:54.313 --> 31:55.479
           - The loo.

31:55.481 --> 31:57.247
    - 13, you'll miss the--

31:57.249 --> 31:59.216
        - 12.
        - Rocket launch.

31:59.218 --> 32:01.151
 - I've had enough of rockets.

32:01.153 --> 32:02.519
       - Lift off in 10.

32:04.623 --> 32:05.522
             Nine.

32:06.525 --> 32:07.591
       (engine rumbling)
       Eight,

32:07.593 --> 32:08.492
             Seven.

32:10.996 --> 32:15.132
       - It's happening,
       it's happening.

32:15.134 --> 32:17.567
     - So we're getting in
     reports from onsite

32:17.569 --> 32:20.103
 that it is actually happening.

32:20.105 --> 32:21.038
            - Three,

32:23.208 --> 32:24.141
              two,

32:26.278 --> 32:27.210
              one.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.013
            - Zero.

32:30.015 --> 32:32.950
       (engine blasting)

32:39.158 --> 32:42.059
        (dramatic music)

32:50.569 --> 32:53.170
       - Can you describe
       what it feels like

32:53.172 --> 32:55.305
 to be so close to the rocket?

32:55.307 --> 33:00.243
   - Of course, yes, it's
   absolutely indescribable.

33:17.429 --> 33:20.297
      - We have lift off.

33:20.299 --> 33:22.065
      Some bubbly perhaps.

33:22.067 --> 33:23.433
        - No, thank you

33:23.435 --> 33:27.337
   I'm the designated driver
        of this rocket.

33:27.339 --> 33:30.040
         (cork popping)

33:32.011 --> 33:32.743
             oh no.

33:38.751 --> 33:40.117
       The cork is stuck.

33:40.119 --> 33:42.652
      I can't control it.

33:43.589 --> 33:44.654
         - Oh goodness.

33:51.563 --> 33:52.529
       - What's going on?

33:55.067 --> 33:56.466
 - Oh we have to do something,

33:56.468 --> 33:58.568
    I should take a selfie.

34:02.441 --> 34:04.241
          - My cheese.

34:04.243 --> 34:08.110
   - They'll be dust and
   debris, de-brie, (laughs).

34:09.047 --> 34:10.781
 - Louis you have to take over,

34:10.783 --> 34:13.382
    I need to disconnect the
    external control system.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.719
     - Oh that sounds like
     a delicate operation.

34:17.156 --> 34:19.723
         (Alfie yells)

34:19.725 --> 34:21.525
- 30% keel over and increasing.

34:21.527 --> 34:23.793
 Connect gyrostabilizer flaps.

34:26.165 --> 34:27.097
            Peddle.

34:34.172 --> 34:37.507
  - This is appalling, someone
  could get badly hurt here.

34:37.509 --> 34:40.643
   Why aren't we filming
   people who could get hurt?

34:40.646 --> 34:42.746
- Because er, we could get hurt.

34:47.753 --> 34:51.188
 - Rocket injuries are covered
 by the natural disaster fund.

34:51.190 --> 34:53.824
 - Listen to me Louis, you
 need to level out the rocket.

34:53.826 --> 34:56.359
   Reverse the gyrostabilizer
   and give extra thrust

34:56.360 --> 34:58.428
when you reach the safety zone.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.230
         - I am trying.

35:00.232 --> 35:05.302
     - This was not part
     of my job description.

35:11.743 --> 35:14.778
       (engines blasting)

35:24.389 --> 35:27.724
  - Fantastic, have you ever
  seen anything so beautiful?

35:28.861 --> 35:30.193
     - Get out of the way.

35:32.498 --> 35:33.430
            - Yeah!

35:36.668 --> 35:37.601
             - Huh?

35:43.609 --> 35:46.143
   - Can I go to the loo now?

35:46.145 --> 35:49.212
  - What, yes you can go now.

35:49.214 --> 35:50.480
          - Thank you.

35:50.482 --> 35:53.650
     - Oh wasn't there a
     loo here a moment ago.

35:53.652 --> 35:56.920
     (tense dramatic music)

36:02.161 --> 36:05.495
     - Must be the cabbage
     I had yesterday.

36:05.497 --> 36:08.298
        (alarm blaring)

36:10.502 --> 36:14.638
- Alfie, did we build the rocket
with an external bathroom?

36:14.640 --> 36:15.772
  - [Alfie] What do you mean?

36:15.774 --> 36:17.807
       - The loo is stuck
       to the rocket.

36:17.809 --> 36:20.443
     - Oh no, that's
     where Luca was going.

36:23.916 --> 36:26.850
   - We have to get Luca in
   here before he falls out.

36:26.852 --> 36:28.451
      Here you take over.

36:47.239 --> 36:48.572
       (knocking on door)

36:48.574 --> 36:50.907
  - It's occupied do you mind.

36:56.982 --> 36:58.515
        What's going on?

36:59.418 --> 37:01.952
         (Luca screams)

37:03.689 --> 37:04.621
            Me hat!

37:15.968 --> 37:19.636
 - You have to stop doing this
 Luca, you could get hurt.

37:20.672 --> 37:23.840
    - Louis I'm never ever
    going to the loo again.

37:23.842 --> 37:25.842
      - This is not going
      according to plan.

37:25.844 --> 37:29.346
  - Oh don't worry, the more
  people we have from Flaklypa

37:29.348 --> 37:32.983
     the better, it simply
     confirms that Flaklypa

37:32.985 --> 37:35.919
      is the space capital
      of the world.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.989
       - Yeah, how is the
       loo, I mean Luca.

37:38.991 --> 37:42.392
   - He has his liquorice and
   he's sitting up in bed.

37:42.394 --> 37:43.927
       - Will he be okay?

37:43.929 --> 37:47.864
  - Everything under control,
  he likes the outdoors,

37:47.866 --> 37:51.368
  couldn't be further out then
  this, isn't that right Luca?

37:51.370 --> 37:52.602
       We're doing great.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.371
    - [Alfie] You're about
    to exit the atmosphere,

37:54.373 --> 37:56.673
 extinguish the booster rockets

37:56.675 --> 38:00.043
      and set your course
      for the Moon.

38:00.045 --> 38:03.980
     - Aye aye, I'm setting
     course for the Moon.

38:03.982 --> 38:06.449
- Our heroes are on their way--

38:06.451 --> 38:09.853
     - Our heroes are on
     their way to the Moon.

38:09.855 --> 38:11.788
 - We'll return as soon as
 something interesting happens.

38:11.790 --> 38:15.458
 - We'll return as soon as
 something interesting happens.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.661
       Thanks so much
       for tuning in to--

38:17.663 --> 38:19.396
       - That's my line,
       not yours Hansen.

38:19.398 --> 38:22.699
  - We'll return as soon as
  something happens here in--

38:22.701 --> 38:25.068
    - As soon as something
    happens here in Flaklypa

38:25.070 --> 38:27.070
- Good evening, and good night.

38:27.072 --> 38:29.506
    - Good evening and thank
    you for watching, cut.

38:29.508 --> 38:30.840
   - Thank you for watching.

38:31.910 --> 38:35.312
     (bright bouncy music)

38:41.053 --> 38:44.954
  - In less then a week we'll
  be selling Moon cheese.

38:46.091 --> 38:49.693
    (gentle classical music)

39:25.630 --> 39:26.796
            - Louis!

39:26.798 --> 39:28.098
        - Not now Luca.

39:41.780 --> 39:42.679
           - Sausage.

39:47.152 --> 39:50.120
  - [Alfie] Remember to engage
  artificial gravitation

39:50.122 --> 39:52.889
    so you don't float about
    and hurt yourselves.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.891
  - Artificial gravitation on.

39:54.893 --> 39:57.660
         (Luca groans)

39:57.662 --> 39:59.896
      Next stop, the Moon.

40:10.609 --> 40:12.809
           (snoring)

40:26.191 --> 40:29.092
        - Space it's so,
        it's really big,

40:30.662 --> 40:32.462
      and dark, and empty.

40:34.132 --> 40:37.767
 - There's also the occasional
 planet I've been told.

40:37.769 --> 40:41.104
 And stars with light that
 travels for thousands of years

40:41.106 --> 40:42.972
     before we can see it.

40:42.974 --> 40:45.909
       - Is light usually
       so slow in space?

40:45.911 --> 40:50.146
  - No but the stars are very
  far away from where we are

40:50.148 --> 40:52.916
     so they could actually
     be long extinguished

40:52.918 --> 40:55.018
before we even see their light.

40:55.020 --> 40:56.619
 - [Luca] That's very far away.

40:56.621 --> 40:59.055
    - And the universe is
    even greater then that.

40:59.057 --> 41:01.558
     Even a blood pimped
     Delorean time machine

41:01.560 --> 41:04.928
   with triple boost turbo
   could drive for thousands

41:04.930 --> 41:07.564
       of years and never
       reach the end.

41:07.566 --> 41:08.798
     Think about that Luca.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.667
    - [Luca] You'd probably
    hit a wall or something

41:10.669 --> 41:12.936
        sooner or later.

41:12.937 --> 41:15.204
 - [Louis] Luca, when you run
 into that wall in outer space,

41:15.207 --> 41:18.675
   you have to ask yourself,
   what is on the other side

41:18.677 --> 41:19.609
         of that wall?

41:22.614 --> 41:24.814
         (loud banging)

41:24.816 --> 41:25.982
          - The wall.

41:25.984 --> 41:28.051
      - No space rubbish.

41:28.053 --> 41:31.154
 The universe will be the
 dumping ground of the future.

41:31.156 --> 41:33.890
   People think that they can
   chuck anything out here.

41:35.193 --> 41:39.162
   - Oh such a shame to
   throw out all that stuff.

41:39.164 --> 41:41.164
     Things that could
     have been used again,

41:41.166 --> 41:43.833
 bits and bobs, this and that.

41:43.835 --> 41:46.069
   You can make loads of
   stuff out of other stuff.

41:46.071 --> 41:48.671
    - Look I think the
    Russians have been here.

41:48.673 --> 41:50.607
  - And the Americans an all.

41:51.243 --> 41:54.143
        (dramatic music)

41:57.582 --> 42:02.652
        (fabric tearing)
        (air hissing)

42:03.989 --> 42:05.722
        (alarms blaring)

42:05.724 --> 42:07.190
 - The government never sleeps.

42:07.192 --> 42:08.959
            - What?

42:08.960 --> 42:10.727
 - Louis you're leaking
 oxygen, you need to go outside

42:10.729 --> 42:11.828
         and repair it.

42:11.830 --> 42:14.230
  - Out, go out of the rocket?

42:14.232 --> 42:17.700
     - Don't worry yourself
     he has six jet packs.

42:17.702 --> 42:20.737
   - Do you mean jet packs,
   or do you mean six packs.

42:20.739 --> 42:21.771
         - I mean both.

42:23.909 --> 42:26.709
     The six jet pack has a
     built in micro brewery

42:26.711 --> 42:28.678
   which generates the power.

42:28.680 --> 42:30.880
     100 Newton meters of
     pressure are produced

42:30.882 --> 42:33.316
     by the brewing process
     which can be adjusted

42:33.318 --> 42:37.120
   to make stronger ale for
   extra thrust is required.

42:42.561 --> 42:45.628
      (suspenseful music)

42:51.336 --> 42:54.671
      (jet pack whooshing)

43:02.714 --> 43:05.148
         (air hissing)

43:13.825 --> 43:15.925
       (Louis screaming)

43:15.927 --> 43:16.859
             - No!

43:29.774 --> 43:30.873
         Oh no, Louis!

43:44.689 --> 43:46.623
     - Can he fix the hole?

43:48.660 --> 43:50.644
        - Looks like it.

43:50.645 --> 43:52.629
    - Oh I think this calls
    for a small celebration.

43:53.698 --> 43:55.665
     - Well the hole is
     fixed but they've lost

43:55.667 --> 43:59.335
a lot of oxygen in the meantime,
this could mean trouble.

43:59.337 --> 44:02.372
  - We have just received
  word from the control center

44:02.374 --> 44:05.642
  that things could go wrong.

44:05.644 --> 44:07.777
       - How on Earth did
       they know that?

44:07.779 --> 44:10.013
     - This according to
     the sources very close

44:10.015 --> 44:11.848
      to the inventor, and
      everyone is asking

44:11.850 --> 44:15.118
 whether or not the Moon
 landing could be compromised.

44:15.120 --> 44:17.286
           (farting)

44:17.288 --> 44:21.691
- Just pretend I'm not here,
but is the landing compromised,

44:21.693 --> 44:23.226
    everyone's been asking.

44:23.228 --> 44:26.996
     - No, no, the landing
     is not compromised.

44:26.998 --> 44:28.931
     - Viewers we've just
     received conformation

44:28.933 --> 44:32.168
      that the landing
      is not compromised.

44:32.170 --> 44:36.172
 - No it's not compromised, but
 anymore unexpected problems

44:36.174 --> 44:38.808
    like that one and we'll
    have to turn around.

44:38.810 --> 44:40.009
             - Yes.

44:40.011 --> 44:41.077
             - Yes.

44:41.079 --> 44:42.011
             - Yes.

44:42.013 --> 44:45.248
    - [Alfie] Start descent
    and landing procedures.

44:46.317 --> 44:48.985
     - Commence descent and
     landing procedures.

44:48.987 --> 44:50.853
     Louis, where are you?

44:50.855 --> 44:53.322
       - I'm just fixing
       the six jet pack.

44:54.993 --> 44:57.026
      Never know when it
      will come in handy.

44:58.897 --> 45:00.263
         (Louis burps)

45:00.265 --> 45:04.367
  - But Louis you're the first
  in command, the captain.

45:05.336 --> 45:06.269
             - Er,

45:07.939 --> 45:10.039
why is that green dot blinking?

45:10.041 --> 45:11.474
- It's just the motion sensors,

45:11.476 --> 45:13.876
      Louis is down below
      in the cargo hold.

45:16.314 --> 45:19.849
    - But are there supposed
    to be two dots there?

45:21.319 --> 45:24.987
     Oh dear, that's more
     then there should be.

45:25.924 --> 45:28.391
 - Take it easy Luca I'm on it.

45:36.801 --> 45:39.869
      (suspenseful music)

45:43.174 --> 45:45.975
        (radar pinging)

45:54.319 --> 45:55.885
       Is somebody here?

46:18.543 --> 46:20.376
- Don't take another step Louis,

46:20.378 --> 46:22.445
     there's something
     right in front of yah.

46:24.349 --> 46:25.281
             - Huh?

46:36.528 --> 46:37.860
         - Louis stop.

46:47.405 --> 46:48.905
        - Nothing here.

46:50.408 --> 46:55.478
       What in the name?

47:01.286 --> 47:03.553
           (growling)

47:05.356 --> 47:07.190
  Flaklypa we have a problem.

47:10.929 --> 47:13.296
  - He says he's here to
  keep an eye on some cheese,

47:13.298 --> 47:16.165
   a chap called Oliver
   Clifford smuggled onboard.

47:16.167 --> 47:20.303
 - Oh for heavens sake, I can't
 believe that Oliver Clifford.

47:20.305 --> 47:21.938
    This is the final straw.

47:21.940 --> 47:24.173
  - One more person
  shouldn't matter should it?

47:24.175 --> 47:27.443
     - Yeah but that person
     is Emanuel Desperado,

47:27.445 --> 47:29.212
       lungs like a tuba.

47:29.214 --> 47:33.916
   He'll use a lot of oxygen,
   and after that leak it's--

47:33.918 --> 47:36.319
   - But there's some oxygen
   surely it will be enough.

47:36.321 --> 47:38.588
   - The most important thing
   now is that we get them

47:38.590 --> 47:41.891
     back home, the oxygen
     level is far too low

47:41.893 --> 47:45.995
  to sustain four astronauts,
  you must abort the mission.

47:46.898 --> 47:49.065
            (growls)

47:56.441 --> 48:01.043
    Hello, I repeat the
    oxygen level is too low,

48:01.045 --> 48:03.980
  abort mission, hello, abort.

48:05.917 --> 48:07.984
     Hello can you hear me?

48:07.986 --> 48:11.520
  - This will make Flaklypa no
  better then any other town.

48:11.522 --> 48:13.522
        - Oh no, that is
        not the problem.

48:13.524 --> 48:17.226
  - Not a problem, that's the
  greatest load of rubbish

48:17.228 --> 48:18.327
        I've ever heard.

48:20.265 --> 48:21.597
        (alarm blaring)
        - Oh no.

48:25.136 --> 48:27.904
      I need peace and
      quiet so I can work.

48:27.906 --> 48:31.340
    - You will be remembered
    as a complete failure.

48:33.177 --> 48:38.247
  - Calling La Pollo One, I
  repeat abort mission, hello.

48:42.687 --> 48:43.586
            - Hello.

48:44.455 --> 48:45.454
      - What's Alfie say?

48:45.456 --> 48:49.692
     - I don't know, it's a
     very poor connection.

48:52.063 --> 48:54.397
          (dial tone)

48:54.399 --> 48:55.665
      - What do we do now?

48:55.667 --> 48:58.000
     - We land, Alfie said
     it was very important

48:58.002 --> 49:00.603
   that we land it, that
   was all I could make out.

49:02.273 --> 49:04.707
  Come on then Captain Louis.

49:07.145 --> 49:10.413
    - The first Norwegian
    to set foot on the Moon.

49:10.415 --> 49:13.316
       (engine rumbling)

49:14.419 --> 49:17.553
    - So gentlemen the Moon
    will soon be Norwegian.

49:18.656 --> 49:21.090
     - But why can't the
     Moon just be Moonian?

49:22.593 --> 49:25.528
    - What, Moonian, listen
    here, there's no doubt

49:25.530 --> 49:27.697
     that Norway is the
     right nation to manage

49:27.699 --> 49:29.565
      the Moons resources.

49:29.567 --> 49:30.499
          - Resources?

49:30.501 --> 49:35.571
- The remote control is ruined,
I need to get in contact

49:35.573 --> 49:39.075
       with them or it'll
       be a disaster.

49:42.180 --> 49:45.648
      - Citizens of Norway
      at this very moment,

49:45.650 --> 49:49.618
     La Pollo One is
     going in for landing.

49:52.123 --> 49:54.523
     - My cheese'll land on
     the Moon any minute.

49:55.994 --> 49:59.628
  - I am sitting here with
  Lord Mayor Stengelfohn-Glad.

49:59.630 --> 50:04.266
    - Space Exploration Lord
    Mayor Stengelfohn-Glad.

50:04.268 --> 50:06.635
     - Yes, there seemed to
     be an issue regarding

50:06.637 --> 50:09.071
    the oxygen, is it fixed?

50:09.073 --> 50:13.743
   - Oh yes, nothing can stop
   the people of Flaklypa.

50:13.745 --> 50:15.644
       When we've got our
       eye on something.

50:16.748 --> 50:18.481
             - Oh.

50:18.483 --> 50:21.684
     (inspirational music)

50:32.263 --> 50:35.131
        (engine roaring)

50:43.674 --> 50:48.377
   - Oh no, La Pollo One,
   you are nearly out of air,

50:48.379 --> 50:49.412
        take off again.

50:49.414 --> 50:54.750
     Oh I need to regain
     contact with them now.

51:00.658 --> 51:01.757
         - Easy peasy.

51:03.561 --> 51:04.794
              Yes!

51:04.796 --> 51:08.431
      - Yes my friends the
      eagle has landed.

51:10.701 --> 51:12.735
 Well perhaps it's a pheasant.

51:12.737 --> 51:14.637
      - It could be
      anything from here.

51:14.639 --> 51:16.572
       - No, no, I think
       it's a pheasant.

51:16.574 --> 51:20.342
    But that's beside the
    point, the main thing is

51:20.344 --> 51:23.479
      the rocket has now
      landed on the Moon.

51:23.481 --> 51:28.551
 And the moment we've all been
 waiting for is almost here.

51:29.153 --> 51:30.119
         - The buffet?

51:30.121 --> 51:32.621
 - No, a Norwegian on the Moon.

51:32.623 --> 51:35.357
      - Oh yes, that too.

51:48.306 --> 51:51.240
     - [Frederick] Is
     that Louis Gunderson?

51:51.242 --> 51:53.642
 - Louis, Louis, Louis, Louis!

51:55.847 --> 52:00.649
    Oh, Vigfus, Vigfus,
    Vigfus, Vigfus, Vigfus!

52:02.420 --> 52:04.453
            (gasps)

52:05.656 --> 52:08.657
     - In the future
     everyone will remember

52:08.659 --> 52:11.727
      what they were doing
      at this very moment.

52:13.297 --> 52:14.230
           - Boogers.

52:15.500 --> 52:18.567
   - I think everyone in the
   country must be watching

52:18.569 --> 52:20.402
    their screens right now.

52:23.741 --> 52:25.841
     And we will shortly be
     hearing from the brave

52:25.843 --> 52:27.810
        patriot himself.

52:29.547 --> 52:31.814
   - One small step for man,

52:37.622 --> 52:42.591
     but one huge step for
     Norwegian bureaucracy.

52:42.593 --> 52:45.794
 - Yeah, yes, that's beautiful.

52:47.331 --> 52:51.800
  - Hey, you said you'd wait
  for me so I could go first.

52:54.272 --> 52:55.504
            (laughs)

52:55.506 --> 52:57.273
      - The government
      doesn't pay millions

52:57.275 --> 52:59.708
      so a non-government
      official like you

52:59.710 --> 53:02.211
    can go first, buzz off.

53:02.213 --> 53:05.381
     (inspirational music)

53:11.756 --> 53:15.424
     I hereby declare the
     Moon to be Norwegian.

53:20.331 --> 53:24.633
   May you provide our nation
   with joy and wealth.

53:24.635 --> 53:26.936
           (cheering)

53:31.676 --> 53:34.810
       - In your face
       rest of the world.

53:34.812 --> 53:35.878
          - Wonderful!

53:49.293 --> 53:51.860
   - The previous owner did
   a poor job of tidying up.

53:52.863 --> 53:55.798
    I'm sure there's a
    return deposit on this.

53:55.800 --> 53:58.500
- Yes, time to start the robot.

53:59.770 --> 54:00.703
          - The robot?

54:08.279 --> 54:10.813
        (alarm blaring)

54:14.318 --> 54:17.586
    What in the world,
    Alfie didn't make that.

54:19.824 --> 54:21.924
      - No this is too
      high tech for Alfie.

54:21.926 --> 54:24.460
  It is the Gov Vacuum C-type.

54:24.462 --> 54:27.863
    A very complex robot,
    it will vacuum the Moon.

54:27.865 --> 54:29.431
           - But why?

54:29.433 --> 54:32.635
   - You see Moon dust
   contains a very rare metal

54:32.637 --> 54:34.737
   that isn't found on Earth.

54:34.739 --> 54:36.272
           Vigfusium.

54:36.974 --> 54:40.042
 - Vigfusium, named after you?

54:40.044 --> 54:43.979
     - Vigfusium is a very
     valuable substance

54:43.981 --> 54:47.983
      with countless uses,
      we'll start it now

54:47.985 --> 54:51.020
     so it can gather dust
     for several years

54:51.022 --> 54:53.589
       and we'll return
       to fetch it later.

54:53.591 --> 54:55.624
     And then we'll sell
     the dust for billions.

54:55.626 --> 54:57.893
     - But what'll happen
     to the Moon if we take

54:57.895 --> 55:00.496
   all the Moon dust off it?

55:00.498 --> 55:01.630
       - Nothing at all.

55:05.036 --> 55:06.702
      Well almost nothing.

55:06.704 --> 55:09.038
     The reflections will
     be weaker that's all.

55:10.875 --> 55:13.509
 - Weaker reflections he says,

55:16.080 --> 55:17.580
   what does he mean by that?

55:17.581 --> 55:19.081
   - He means Luca that the
   Moon won't shine no more.

55:20.618 --> 55:25.688
    - No more Moon lantern.

55:28.492 --> 55:31.393
        (dramatic music)

55:39.937 --> 55:41.070
    - But you can't do that.

55:41.072 --> 55:43.005
     - We can buy a million
     electric lights

55:43.007 --> 55:44.573
 with all the money we'll earn.

55:44.575 --> 55:46.809
   - That doesn't matter,
   you are not going to drive

55:46.811 --> 55:48.644
     this robot out Vigfus.

55:48.646 --> 55:50.913
  - That's not your decision,
  it is the Norwegian people

55:50.915 --> 55:52.715
     represented by the
     Norwegian government,

55:52.717 --> 55:53.782
       represented by me.

55:53.784 --> 55:57.086
- I'm people too, I pay my tax.

55:59.490 --> 56:02.057
     Or at least I've paid
     a lot of parking fines

56:02.059 --> 56:03.559
        over the years.

56:03.561 --> 56:07.896
     - Fine, let's do this
     the democratic way.

56:07.898 --> 56:11.500
 We'll vote on it, those in
 favor of exploiting the Moons

56:11.502 --> 56:14.370
      resources so that
      Norway can get rich

56:14.372 --> 56:15.938
and we can create a banana fund,

56:15.940 --> 56:18.374
     and buy all the
     bananas in the world,

56:19.110 --> 56:21.043
  apprehend the other two now.

56:21.979 --> 56:24.847
        (dramatic music)

56:25.850 --> 56:29.017
      - I thought we
      were a team Vigfus.

56:29.019 --> 56:32.488
     - I'm sorry Louis but
     I am the government,

56:32.490 --> 56:34.523
  that's the only team I need.

56:37.828 --> 56:40.662
        (Louis groaning)

56:45.703 --> 56:47.469
     ¶ Norway is the best ¶

56:47.471 --> 56:49.972
 ¶ It always stands the test ¶

56:49.974 --> 56:52.474
   ¶ Norway can vacuum the ¶

56:52.476 --> 56:55.077
       ¶ Entire planet ¶

57:04.855 --> 57:07.990
     - Cooey don't you want
     to celebrate Alfie?

57:07.992 --> 57:10.492
     - Why don't you go
     celebrate on your own

57:10.494 --> 57:13.495
   somewhere very far away,
   I need to get my lads home

57:13.497 --> 57:14.797
  before they run out of air.

57:14.799 --> 57:16.532
     - Are they in danger?

57:16.534 --> 57:18.767
     - If I can recalibrate
     this to the machine

57:18.769 --> 57:21.470
 that goes beep when everything
 works as it should--

57:21.472 --> 57:22.638
             - Yes.

57:22.640 --> 57:24.173
      - I could do with
      another power lead.

57:24.175 --> 57:27.009
      - I am a born
      leader, I can help.

57:27.011 --> 57:28.744
  - No, something with metal.

57:28.746 --> 57:30.179
       Oh I don't have
       the time for this.

57:33.117 --> 57:34.567
          - Like this?

57:34.568 --> 57:36.018
     - That might actually
     work, thanks.

57:36.020 --> 57:40.088
   - Don't mention it, we
   must get those boys back.

57:40.090 --> 57:42.574
             - Yes.

57:42.575 --> 57:45.059
- Oh there will be consternation
in the press otherwise.

57:45.863 --> 57:49.131
     (tense dramatic music)

57:53.070 --> 57:54.670
      ¶ Hooray for Norway
      independence day ¶

57:54.672 --> 57:58.874
       ¶ And the Moon and
       all that stuff ¶

58:00.478 --> 58:02.611
      - You're gonna
      regret this Emanuel.

58:03.614 --> 58:05.948
       (Emanuel mumbles)

58:05.950 --> 58:08.750
     - I hope someone up
     there knows Morse code

58:08.752 --> 58:10.252
'cause we don't have much time.

58:11.822 --> 58:15.757
    ¶ The Moon is dark, very
    very dark and gray ¶

58:15.759 --> 58:17.259
    - Well time to go home.

58:17.261 --> 58:20.863
    - You need me to fly the
    rocket, so let me go.

58:20.865 --> 58:24.700
   - So you can sabotage my
   robot on the Moon, never.

58:24.702 --> 58:28.103
     I can manage just fine
     with my new pilot,

58:28.105 --> 58:30.539
        Captain Emanuel.

58:30.541 --> 58:33.141
        (Emanuel gasps)

58:36.580 --> 58:39.681
   Just give it a little bit
   of time, we'll be fine.

58:39.683 --> 58:43.185
   - Here Louis, why's that
   machine beeping like that?

58:44.255 --> 58:45.854
       - It's supposed
       to beep so we know

58:45.856 --> 58:47.022
     everything's in order.

58:48.058 --> 58:51.059
    - Oh good thing too
    'cause that wouldn't be

58:51.061 --> 58:55.664
  a very good message if that
  was actually Morse code.

58:55.666 --> 58:57.599
   - Do you know Morse code?

58:57.601 --> 59:01.870
  - Oh yeah, it's the
  emergency code used as sea.

59:01.872 --> 59:03.739
     You know like if you
     get into difficulties

59:03.741 --> 59:05.674
       out on the ocean.

59:05.676 --> 59:09.177
 - And what would that beeping
 mean if it were Morse code?

59:09.179 --> 59:14.216
       - Come back now,
       not much air left.

59:16.120 --> 59:19.221
      But this isn't Morse
      code though, is it?

59:21.859 --> 59:24.626
 - Vigfus, what have you done!

59:24.628 --> 59:26.161
     - We can discuss that
     later but for now

59:26.163 --> 59:28.263
    you are reinstated as
    captain so we can hurry

59:28.265 --> 59:29.331
        back home again.

59:29.333 --> 59:31.133
       (Emanuel grumbles)

59:31.135 --> 59:34.703
    - Calling Flaklypa, La
    Pollo calling Flaklypa.

59:34.705 --> 59:38.006
      I can't get through.

59:38.008 --> 59:42.244
   - Oh dear, this must be
   the source of the failure.

59:42.246 --> 59:46.248
   - Calling Flaklypa, Alfie
   are you there, Alfie.

59:49.753 --> 59:51.653
     - [Alfie] Is everyone
     okay up there?

59:51.655 --> 59:54.056
    - We just found out
    about the oxygen Alfie,

59:54.058 --> 59:56.224
  is there still hope for us?

59:56.226 --> 59:59.094
  - Of course, but you need
  to take one thing at a time.

59:59.096 --> 01:00:01.229
     It's difficult but if
     the rocket comes up

01:00:01.231 --> 01:00:02.731
      to it's full speed.

01:00:02.733 --> 01:00:05.000
      - Good, commence
      departure procedure.

01:00:06.136 --> 01:00:09.671
    (rocket engine roaring)

01:00:11.008 --> 01:00:12.741
      Are you ready Luca?

01:00:13.978 --> 01:00:14.910
             Luca?

01:00:20.384 --> 01:00:22.784
     - He's probably hiding
     in the cargo hold.

01:00:27.658 --> 01:00:28.757
         - Oh no Luca.

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:38.066
            - Stop!

01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:47.876
    In the name of the Moon.

01:00:50.914 --> 01:00:51.813
             Stop!

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.000
         (Luca groans)

01:01:15.439 --> 01:01:17.839
   - Luca what are you doing?

01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:22.144
      We're going home, we
      have to leave now.

01:01:22.146 --> 01:01:27.015
    - But the robot it's
    gonna destroy the Moon.

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:31.186
   - We need to leave now or
   we'll run out of oxygen.

01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:33.755
    If that isn't dangerous
    I don't know what is,

01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:35.357
         come on Luca.

01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:37.693
           - Er, no!

01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:39.728
             - No?

01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:42.764
     - Remember those stars
     you told me about,

01:01:42.766 --> 01:01:45.867
      the ones that died
      a very long time ago

01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:47.736
     but they still shine?

01:01:47.738 --> 01:01:49.071
            - Yeah.

01:01:49.073 --> 01:01:53.075
     - If we leave now the
     Moon will go all dark

01:01:53.077 --> 01:01:56.211
 and that's how it'll stay for
 the rest of our lifetimes.

01:01:57.147 --> 01:01:59.381
 - Yeah I know but Luca look--

01:01:59.383 --> 01:02:02.484
   - But if we save the Moon
   it'll keep on shining

01:02:02.486 --> 01:02:05.754
     long after we're gone,
     maybe even longer.

01:02:09.793 --> 01:02:14.730
 And not a lot of people get to
 save the Moon Louis, do they?

01:02:20.938 --> 01:02:24.773
   - Luca, I rarely say this,

01:02:24.775 --> 01:02:27.876
but you know what you're right.

01:02:30.814 --> 01:02:33.949
 - No, no, no, those idiots
 are going to ruin everything,

01:02:33.951 --> 01:02:36.818
       I must stop them,
       I'll be back soon.

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:37.486
       (Emanuel mumbles)

01:02:37.488 --> 01:02:38.820
     Don't breath too much.

01:02:40.224 --> 01:02:42.257
       (machine whirring)

01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:43.925
        - We'll never be
        able to stop it.

01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:47.129
 - It's just a machine, and
 machine's can be switched off.

01:02:49.299 --> 01:02:51.833
        - Hello, hello.

01:02:51.835 --> 01:02:54.102
   Can someone tell me
   what's going on up there?

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:57.038
       (Emanuel mumbles)

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:04.980
   What, I don't understand,
   can you repeat that?

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:08.984
        (dramatic music)

01:03:10.187 --> 01:03:13.054
       (machine beeping)

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:17.993
          (Luca yells)

01:03:17.995 --> 01:03:19.795
      - There's the
      control panel Luca.

01:03:21.031 --> 01:03:23.865
      You're gonna have to
      disable the robot.

01:03:23.867 --> 01:03:25.500
      - How am I supposed
      to get onto it?

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:29.137
          - Good Luca.

01:03:30.073 --> 01:03:31.406
      Pull out the cable.

01:03:31.408 --> 01:03:36.211
 It's been fun Mr Robot but
 it's time to say night night.

01:03:40.818 --> 01:03:41.550
              Huh?

01:03:41.552 --> 01:03:42.951
  - You might as well give up.

01:03:43.854 --> 01:03:45.020
           - Vigfus!

01:03:45.022 --> 01:03:46.988
    - The government is
    always two steps ahead.

01:03:49.059 --> 01:03:51.259
    I apologize, but I
    can't allow you to stop

01:03:51.261 --> 01:03:53.895
    the robot, this is what
    we will all live off

01:03:53.897 --> 01:03:54.996
     when the oil is gone.

01:03:57.501 --> 01:04:00.569
    I just have Norway's
    best interests in mind.

01:04:00.571 --> 01:04:01.837
      This isn't personal.

01:04:02.906 --> 01:04:04.372
       - That's a relief.

01:04:07.077 --> 01:04:09.511
      - Let go, that is
      government property.

01:04:10.614 --> 01:04:13.215
          (Luca yells)

01:04:15.919 --> 01:04:16.852
            Get off.

01:04:20.257 --> 01:04:21.590
        - Out of my way.

01:04:28.632 --> 01:04:29.965
     - The remote control!

01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:34.236
       - I'm stuck, help!

01:04:36.139 --> 01:04:37.272
       - I'm coming Luca.

01:04:39.509 --> 01:04:41.543
       - Vacuum Type-C
       has gone bonkers.

01:04:49.253 --> 01:04:50.919
            - Help!

01:04:50.921 --> 01:04:51.653
           - I can't.

01:04:52.489 --> 01:04:53.421
            - Help!

01:05:01.198 --> 01:05:04.199
       (machine groaning)

01:05:10.674 --> 01:05:11.573
            Emanuel?

01:05:22.986 --> 01:05:24.419
       - Oh he saved us.

01:05:27.291 --> 01:05:29.324
     - He's got a good
     pair of lungs on him.

01:05:29.326 --> 01:05:32.093
    - Looks like he lifts
    weights too doesn't he?

01:05:32.095 --> 01:05:35.297
     - Lifts them, he eats
     them for breakfast.

01:05:38.335 --> 01:05:41.303
      Vigfus you dimwit
      what are you doing?

01:05:41.305 --> 01:05:42.570
      - I didn't mean too,

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:47.542
I just, well the government and,

01:05:47.544 --> 01:05:49.210
      it was all so clear.

01:05:50.247 --> 01:05:51.980
      - You could have
      actually killed us.

01:05:53.016 --> 01:05:57.285
      - I have killed us,
      a long time ago.

01:05:57.287 --> 01:05:59.988
      We don't have enough
      oxygen to get back.

01:06:09.967 --> 01:06:10.699
             - No.

01:06:15.105 --> 01:06:17.305
   Sorry I let you down lads.

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:31.286
     - Look for a pessimist
     I'm really impressed

01:06:31.288 --> 01:06:33.755
       that you're taking
       this so well Luca.

01:06:33.757 --> 01:06:36.358
   And you know if this
   really, really is the end

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:40.195
  for Louis Gunderson at
  least we go out with a bang,

01:06:40.197 --> 01:06:41.129
          on the Moon.

01:06:41.131 --> 01:06:44.566
    I can honestly say I've
    had an interesting life,

01:06:44.568 --> 01:06:47.535
 with good friends, not
 everyone has been so blessed.

01:06:48.739 --> 01:06:51.306
   - I thought the
   government was my friend,

01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:54.342
     it's been the only
     friend I've ever had.

01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:00.081
     - It's never too
     late to make friends.

01:07:00.083 --> 01:07:04.085
 We could be your friends, for
 whatever little time's left.

01:07:16.233 --> 01:07:20.769
   - So ladies and gentlemen
   all hope is lost,

01:07:20.771 --> 01:07:22.137
 and now we're going over to--

01:07:22.139 --> 01:07:24.572
      - La Pollo One has
      no more oxygen left,

01:07:24.574 --> 01:07:26.174
    it's probably all over.

01:07:42.225 --> 01:07:44.325
     - Imagine we'll never
     taste another cup

01:07:44.327 --> 01:07:46.227
of freshly brewed coffee again.

01:07:47.764 --> 01:07:51.433
    - And I'll never smell a
    beautiful flower again.

01:07:53.503 --> 01:07:57.605
 - And I'm never going to have
 another day at the office.

01:08:00.143 --> 01:08:03.144
      Well, that's
      actually not so bad.

01:08:03.146 --> 01:08:05.547
    - And I'll never again
    get to take my rage out

01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:07.615
on random objects like this one.

01:08:13.457 --> 01:08:15.857
       - Oh I thought it
       would be heavier.

01:08:15.859 --> 01:08:20.694
    - Oh Vigfusium it really
    is an amazing substance.

01:08:20.697 --> 01:08:24.666
   Can also be used as
   fuel, it makes any engine

01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:26.768
     go five times faster.

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:31.439
       It's too bad we're
       not out of fuel.

01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:34.876
- Five times the speed you say.

01:08:37.581 --> 01:08:40.482
 - Flaklypa we have a solution.

01:08:40.484 --> 01:08:42.383
      The Moon dust is a
      very efficient fuel,

01:08:42.385 --> 01:08:45.120
    we can modify the
    engine so that we can go

01:08:45.122 --> 01:08:47.154
     five times the speed.

01:08:47.157 --> 01:08:51.359
   - If you go five times
   faster the tiny little bit

01:08:51.361 --> 01:08:54.662
  of oxygen you have left
  might just last long enough

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:56.898
      to get you back
      into our atmosphere.

01:08:58.335 --> 01:09:00.234
     - Well we have to try.

01:09:00.237 --> 01:09:01.536
     - Only problem is
     the rocket isn't made

01:09:01.537 --> 01:09:03.238
      to go at that speed.

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:05.140
      - But the rocket is
      made by the best,

01:09:05.142 --> 01:09:07.575
       no one knows how
       much it can take,

01:09:07.577 --> 01:09:09.810
     not until it's
     pushed to it's limit.

01:09:09.813 --> 01:09:11.412
     Vigfus are you coming?

01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:18.319
       - Yes, I'm coming.

01:09:20.624 --> 01:09:23.491
        (engine roaring)

01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:27.462
 - Let's give it our best shot.

01:09:27.464 --> 01:09:28.796
        - Let's go home.

01:09:31.835 --> 01:09:34.636
      - La Pollo has taken
      off from the Moon,

01:09:34.638 --> 01:09:36.770
   but will they return home?

01:09:36.773 --> 01:09:38.773
      They'll have to fly
      faster then anyone

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:40.575
     has ever flown before.

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:48.383
           (groaning)

01:09:48.385 --> 01:09:49.817
- They're on their way at least.

01:09:49.819 --> 01:09:53.188
      - It's a long road,
      a very long road.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:56.824
   - But they are heroes
   regardless of how it ends.

01:09:56.826 --> 01:09:59.894
  Yes it would be great fun
  if they returned home alive,

01:09:59.896 --> 01:10:00.962
      especially for them.

01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:09.671
        (alarm blaring)

01:10:11.274 --> 01:10:13.708
       - Oh this is not
       going to end well.

01:10:19.349 --> 01:10:20.949
- Is it just me or is it getting

01:10:20.951 --> 01:10:22.617
       a bit hot in here?

01:10:23.887 --> 01:10:25.653
  - I'm sorry but at the speed
  you're traveling at now

01:10:25.655 --> 01:10:27.989
     through the atmosphere
     it's bound to heat up.

01:10:29.926 --> 01:10:31.559
    - Heat up, by how much?

01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:34.395
     - It'll be hot enough
     to take a sauna Luca.

01:10:39.436 --> 01:10:42.337
        (glass breaking)

01:10:46.443 --> 01:10:50.445
    - Now I know how freshly
    baked bread feels.

01:10:50.447 --> 01:10:53.848
    - And now I'm here with
    our aluminum expert,

01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:57.352
    can the hull of La Pollo
    One withstand the heat?

01:10:57.354 --> 01:10:58.720
     - Oh yes, no problem.

01:10:58.722 --> 01:10:59.721
         - That's good.

01:10:59.723 --> 01:11:01.456
- But the passengers might not.

01:11:01.458 --> 01:11:05.593
       - Oh, well, will
       they return home,

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:09.931
 or will they fry like
 sausages in their own grease?

01:11:17.874 --> 01:11:21.009
      - Well that's it,
      they're out of air.

01:11:21.011 --> 01:11:23.778
- This is it, hold your breath.

01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:11.726
 - They should be here shortly.

01:12:18.335 --> 01:12:19.734
         - Is that it?

01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:29.477
         (crowd gasps)

01:12:34.351 --> 01:12:39.420
       (triumphant music)
       (crowd cheers)

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:01.976
           - Oh Luca.

01:13:04.114 --> 01:13:06.147
      - I'm never going
      to leave you again.

01:13:07.984 --> 01:13:08.916
            - Alfie!

01:13:11.855 --> 01:13:12.787
       - Thank goodness.

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:20.628
        (Emanuel grunts)

01:13:21.865 --> 01:13:22.897
         - Moon cheese.

01:13:26.469 --> 01:13:28.536
            (yells)

01:13:29.606 --> 01:13:32.607
     - We managed to return
     safely because well,

01:13:32.609 --> 01:13:34.008
      we worked as a team.

01:13:34.010 --> 01:13:37.078
   - But the big question
   is, is the Moon Norwegian?

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:40.681
   - We did plant the
   Norwegian flag on the Moon

01:13:40.683 --> 01:13:43.818
       so the Moon was
       really Norwegian,

01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:47.488
    but we had to bring the
    flag back down again.

01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:49.023
     - Can you tell us why?

01:13:49.025 --> 01:13:51.159
      - I'm afraid that's
      a classified secret,

01:13:51.161 --> 01:13:53.494
  desperate situations
  require desperate measures.

01:13:53.496 --> 01:13:55.496
    - Did we really have to
    take the flag back down?

01:13:55.498 --> 01:13:57.098
- No, but no one owns the Moon.

01:13:58.935 --> 01:14:01.769
 - So the Moon isn't Norwegian?

01:14:01.771 --> 01:14:06.507
    - The Moon is, as a wise
    man once said, Moonian.

01:14:06.509 --> 01:14:09.710
      - A wise man, I
      thought I said that?

01:14:09.712 --> 01:14:12.847
  - Right, will there be more
  Moon expeditions Alfie?

01:14:12.849 --> 01:14:15.783
    - Well I don't think so.

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:19.787
      - But isn't Norway's
      future out there?

01:14:19.789 --> 01:14:23.491
      - When a bicycle
      repair man inventor,

01:14:23.493 --> 01:14:27.528
      a tough magpie, and
      a nervous hedgehog,

01:14:28.765 --> 01:14:32.967
    and a strong gorilla and
    a boring administrator,

01:14:33.937 --> 01:14:34.869
         when a gang--

01:14:34.871 --> 01:14:37.872
  - And a charming Lord Mayor.

01:14:37.874 --> 01:14:40.508
    - When a gang like this
    manages to cooperate

01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:42.743
       to get a rocket to
       the Moon and back,

01:14:43.847 --> 01:14:48.216
     I'm convinced that the
     future lies down here.

01:14:54.657 --> 01:14:57.091
      - And this concludes
      our program.

01:14:57.093 --> 01:14:59.527
     Frederick Hansen would
     you like to sign off?

01:14:59.529 --> 01:15:01.095
      - No, no, you do it.

01:15:01.097 --> 01:15:02.096
           - No you.

01:15:02.098 --> 01:15:03.097
        - No really you.

01:15:03.099 --> 01:15:03.998
           - No you.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:04.999
     - No, no you take it.

01:15:05.001 --> 01:15:07.235
- No you, you deserve the honor.

01:15:07.237 --> 01:15:09.003
        - I'll take it.

01:15:09.005 --> 01:15:10.204
         Say goodnight.

01:15:13.243 --> 01:15:16.511
      (smooth jazz music)

01:15:36.299 --> 01:15:38.666
      - Imagine we was all
      the way up there.

01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:42.103
     - And imagine we
     came back home again.

01:15:42.105 --> 01:15:44.138
      - Yes imagine that.

01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:47.608
    I will never be sending
    you away that far again.

01:15:48.678 --> 01:15:51.279
      - You know it's not
      that far to Mars.

01:15:51.281 --> 01:15:55.616
    - I know but we'd need a
    larger rocket for that,

01:15:55.618 --> 01:15:59.086
      that would mean
      drafting new plans.

01:15:59.088 --> 01:16:01.222
     - [Louis] Read 'em
     and weep, three jacks.

01:16:02.659 --> 01:16:03.891
   - Are you cheating Louis?

01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:07.662
      - Me, I'm as honest
      as the day is long.

01:16:08.765 --> 01:16:10.298
     'specially during the
     short days of winter.

01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:12.633
       - But I have two
       jacks too you see,

01:16:12.635 --> 01:16:14.035
      that can't be right.

01:16:14.037 --> 01:16:16.003
   - Oh there seems to be an
   unusual amount of jacks

01:16:16.005 --> 01:16:17.171
         in this deck.

01:16:17.173 --> 01:16:21.175
    - Well I've got four
    of these, queens, look.

01:16:21.177 --> 01:16:22.944
     - Ah that's where they
     are, I was wondering

01:16:22.946 --> 01:16:24.145
     where they'd got too.

01:16:24.147 --> 01:16:28.716
     - Ah Luca, you always
     have such good luck.

01:16:28.718 --> 01:16:32.587
 - [Luca] Yeah but what if
 all my luck runs out one day?

01:16:33.656 --> 01:16:35.690
      - [Alfie] Nothing
      to worry about Luca,

01:16:35.692 --> 01:16:37.692
    nothing to worry about.

01:16:42.765 --> 01:16:46.233
   (upbeat triumphant music)
