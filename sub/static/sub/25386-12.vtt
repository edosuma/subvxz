to take all that and put it

11:10.211 --> 11:12.171
No, it is not my jam.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.548
I prefer
to spend time
with Matteo,

11:14.548 --> 11:17.510
pleasing my core processors
with cognitive challenges.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.638
Sorry, but he and I
are going rock chucking.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.640
No, you are not.

11:22.640 --> 11:23.974
Now, get out.

11:24.225 --> 11:27.311
(OTIS LAUGHING)

11:27.686 --> 11:30.147
(GRUNTS)
I got soap in my mouth.

11:30.398 --> 11:31.690
This is giving
me flashbacks

11:31.690 --> 11:35.111
to the time I got
my mouth washed out
for saying the S word.

11:35.111 --> 11:36.821
You said...
Yup.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.156
Science.
Door open.

11:39.156 --> 11:42.326
(OTIS LAUGHING)
Door closed.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.041
What happened
to you on stage?

11:49.375 --> 11:52.128
Janice distracted me
by yelling,
"You can do it.

11:52.128 --> 11:53.629
"Woo-hoo."

11:53.629 --> 11:55.631
Can you imagine
anything more devious

11:55.631 --> 11:57.174
or cutthroat?

11:57.174 --> 11:59.301
Or maybe,
she was just being nice.

11:59.635 --> 12:03.139
Lou,
I've been through this
a thousand times.

12:03.139 --> 12:05.099
Janice knows I'm
her main competition,

12:05.391 --> 12:07.393
so she's playing
mind games with me.

12:07.393 --> 12:08.811
Well, game on.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.563
If you want
a real mind game,

12:10.563 --> 12:12.231
there's a box of hay
in the cabin.

12:16.026 --> 12:17.445
Hey, Janice.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.655
Great job
in the question and answer.

12:19.655 --> 12:21.782
Really?
You think
I did all right?

12:21.782 --> 12:22.950
Heck, yeah.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.954
So, the talent competition
is coming up.

12:27.288 --> 12:29.415
What you got
up your sleeve?

12:29.707 --> 12:33.169
Well, despite the fact
that it is Saturday,

12:33.169 --> 12:37.423
I was going to make
one of my famous
ice cream sundaes.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.593
(PATRONIZINGLY)
Oh, that sounds cute.

12:41.677 --> 12:43.304
You don't sound
too impressed.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.264
It's just...

12:46.098 --> 12:47.933
I want to see
you do well.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.603
And making
one sundae is okay,

12:51.228 --> 12:54.398
but, I'd bet you'd really
dazzle the judges,

12:54.648 --> 12:56.609
if you made enough
for the entire crowd,

12:56.859 --> 12:58.027
in 30 seconds.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.528
Oh.

12:59.904 --> 13:02.072
But how
could I do that?

13:02.323 --> 13:05.075
Well, I don't
normally help
competitors.

13:05.534 --> 13:07.953
But,
since you've been
so darn nice,

13:08.496 --> 13:10.539
I suppose
I could tell you
how I'd do it.

13:11.499 --> 13:14.293
You are just
the sweetest thing.
I could hug you!

13:16.128 --> 13:17.671
Still not ready
for the hug?

13:17.671 --> 13:19.298
We'll work
our way up to it.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.598
Otis, Finn said
you were being
mean to him.

13:27.848 --> 13:30.935
I was simply trying
to prevent him from
making a huge mess

13:30.935 --> 13:32.895
that I would have
to clean up.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.730
Well, you are
a cleaning robot.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.565
Isn't cleaning
kind of your jam?

13:37.024 --> 13:38.817
Stop calling me
a cleaning robot.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.195
I am so much
more than that.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.614
Okay, perhaps it is time
to shut you down.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.700
Shut down? Whoa!

13:47.284 --> 13:48.953
Let us not get
ahead of ourselves.

13:49.286 --> 13:51.497
How about when
Matteo gets back,

13:51.747 --> 13:54.959
the three of you
sit down and have
a Grizzly Council Circle?

13:55.459 --> 13:57.378
Please don't make
me do that.

13:57.378 --> 13:58.712
Otis is right.

13:58.712 --> 14:01.090
A Grizzly Council Circle
is exactly what we need.

14:01.590 --> 14:02.591
Science!

14:04.093 --> 14:07.096
Ravi,
why don't you take Finn
to the bathroom

14:07.096 --> 14:08.973
to help him clean up
for the council.

14:09.306 --> 14:11.141
I will light the incense.

14:11.892 --> 14:13.143
Oh, great idea.

14:13.143 --> 14:15.521
I will get
the Tibetan singing bowl.

14:16.772 --> 14:17.982
(DOOR LOCKS)

14:19.733 --> 14:21.819
Hey!
Let us out!

14:22.736 --> 14:24.822
Ha, ha, ha! Suckers.

14:27.741 --> 14:28.993
We have, Janice.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.077
(CROWD APPLAUDING)

14:30.077 --> 14:32.705
And for those of you
who can't read her sash,

14:32.705 --> 14:35.875
she's representing
Ahern's Tick Removal.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.377
You have ticks,
they have tweezers.

14:40.004 --> 14:43.632
Janice is apparently
demonstrating her
vacuuming skills?

14:44.133 --> 14:45.968
Actually, I'm going
to make two dozen

14:46.510 --> 14:48.554
fudge and rainbow sprinkle
ice cream sundaes

14:48.554 --> 14:49.680
in under 30 seconds.

14:50.681 --> 14:51.807
That sounds...

14:52.182 --> 14:53.350
Unnecessary

15:00.274 --> 15:01.483
Okie dokie.

15:01.942 --> 15:03.319
Here goes nothing.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.740
You can do it, Janice!
Woo-hoo!

15:22.671 --> 15:24.924
Oh, sprinkles!

15:27.843 --> 15:29.386
And game over.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.850
Destiny,
what did you do?

15:35.476 --> 15:37.978
Nothing.
I just wished
Janice luck.

15:37.978 --> 15:39.229
I play by the rules.

15:39.229 --> 15:41.732
Unlike the girl
who used a metal detector

15:41.732 --> 15:43.484
to try to find
a needle in a haystack.

15:43.859 --> 15:46.779
Um, I read every word
of those instructions,

15:46.779 --> 15:48.822
and all they said was,
"Find needle."

15:49.531 --> 15:51.951
Destiny, you can't
treat people like this.
It's not right.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.162
Jeepers.

15:55.537 --> 15:57.456
I really blew it. (SIGHS)

15:57.790 --> 15:59.875
I just hope you have
better luck out there
than I did.

16:00.542 --> 16:02.503
If it's not going
to be me who wins,

16:02.836 --> 16:04.421
I really just hope
it's you.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.091
Oh, stop
with the mind games.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.010
I know you want the tiara
just as much as I do.

16:10.803 --> 16:11.929
What?

16:11.929 --> 16:13.055
What are you talking about?

16:13.639 --> 16:16.058
Destiny, I think
you have Janice all wrong.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.643
No, I don't.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.895
This is Lisa
all over again.

16:20.270 --> 16:23.482
You think if I take pity
on you, I won't go in
for the kill?

16:23.857 --> 16:26.819
Well, when I'm in
pageant zone,
I'm a great white.

16:27.528 --> 16:29.905
Look into my eyes,
nothing there.

I have to go get ready
for my performance
of Tomorrow.

Janice, I'm really sorry
Destiny is behaving this way.

16:43.794 --> 16:44.920
Let me go talk to her.

16:44.920 --> 16:45.921
That's okay.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.090
I thought we were
becoming friends.

16:48.882 --> 16:50.426
Obviously, I was wrong.

16:56.932 --> 16:59.810
Otis, you have to
stop playing this song.

the model plane kit.

Destiny,
you really upset Janice.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.954
Well, being a pageant girl
is a hard-knock life.

18:01.955 --> 18:04.875
You are so wrapped up
in this pageant that
you're not being yourself.

18:05.292 --> 18:08.587
The Destiny I know,
would never hurt someone
the way you hurt Janice.

18:09.004 --> 18:11.673
I'm not trying to hurt her.
I'm just trying
to win the tiara.

18:12.049 --> 18:14.009
Yeah, well,
Janice quit the pageant.

18:14.259 --> 18:15.677
So, it looks like
you'll get what you want.

18:16.303 --> 18:17.387
She quit?

18:17.930 --> 18:20.933
So, she wasn't playing
mind games with me?

18:20.933 --> 18:21.975
No.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.561
She was just trying
to be your friend.

I can do this.

you have to do this.

burger you served up
in the question and answer.

what's not awkward?

near-sighted lumberjacks.

Do not make me angry, Matteo.

19:21.118 --> 19:23.912
Otis, you are
completely out of control.

19:24.454 --> 19:26.290
It's time to shut you down.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.374
No.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.626
I will not allow that.

19:30.043 --> 19:31.753
How are you
going to stop me?

19:32.212 --> 19:34.256
I have Finn's dirty laundry,

19:34.256 --> 19:36.175
and I'm not afraid to use it.

Get what?

to choose

Yes.
Finn might be messy,
but he is my friend.

and he never tried to boil
anyone with a toilet.

of our cabin to a robot
wasn't the best idea.

and be a little cleaner
with your stuff.

pass around this plunger.

about me.

is winning the tiara.

I guess I was so worried
about pageant girls
messing with my head,

21:58.483 --> 22:01.320
I didn't notice,
I had become
just as bad as they were.

22:03.447 --> 22:06.325
See, I have been
in pageants
my whole life,

22:06.742 --> 22:09.328
and I've always seen
the other girls
as my competition.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.205
Well, this was
my first pageant,

22:12.706 --> 22:14.708
and maybe I'm stupid,

22:14.708 --> 22:17.836
but I thought it was
a good way to make friends.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.464
You're not stupid at all.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.799
In fact, I'm the one
who had it wrong.

22:23.300 --> 22:26.261
Pageants should be a place
for girls to show off
their best qualities,

22:26.803 --> 22:28.305
not their worst.

22:28.305 --> 22:29.890
I should have
supported you,

22:30.140 --> 22:31.808
instead of sabotaging you.

22:32.309 --> 22:34.102
What made you
realize that?

22:34.519 --> 22:35.645
You.

22:35.645 --> 22:37.481
I've met a lot of girls
in pageants,

22:37.856 --> 22:40.150
but never one
who cared less
about winning,

22:40.442 --> 22:42.027
than she did about
being my friend.

22:42.569 --> 22:44.196
That makes finding
someone like you,

22:44.905 --> 22:47.324
well, like finding
a needle in a haystack.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.701
Ooh, I love that game.

22:49.701 --> 22:51.453
It's whole bunches of fun.

22:53.330 --> 22:55.707
So, what do you think
about us being friends?

22:56.958 --> 22:59.044
Abso-stinking-lutely!

22:59.336 --> 23:02.172
I knew there was a sweetheart
behind those dead shark eyes.

23:02.756 --> 23:05.383
Now, come on over here
for a big old hug.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.345
Unless,
you're still not ready.

23:08.970 --> 23:11.890
Oh, I'm
abso-stinking-lutely ready.

23:12.140 --> 23:13.266
(CHUCKLES)

23:17.896 --> 23:18.897
Wonderful.

23:20.649 --> 23:23.652
The TV Station preempted
the pageant for live
breaking news coverage.

23:23.652 --> 23:25.654
I had to give everyone
their money back.

23:26.154 --> 23:27.364
Oh, the poor campers.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.199
To heck with the campers,
poor me!

23:30.033 --> 23:32.619
Well, I'm sure whatever
the news was,
it was very important.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.205
The town's
stoplight went out.

23:37.541 --> 23:39.459
That's it,
this game is impossible.

23:39.459 --> 23:40.669
I'm returning it.

23:41.294 --> 23:43.380
What's that tiny little bag
stapled to the box?

23:46.049 --> 23:47.259
"Contains needle."

23:48.468 --> 23:51.138
"Tear open and drop into hay."

23:52.013 --> 23:53.348
Damn, stinking needle.

23:54.391 --> 23:55.475
(BOTH LAUGH)
