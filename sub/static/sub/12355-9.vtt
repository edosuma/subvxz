<i>Previously on</i> House of Lies...
Fly?

00:09.127 --> 00:11.492
Nice.
<i>Why are you taking fashion advice</i>

00:11.493 --> 00:15.326
from <i> Boys Don't Cry</i> in there?
<i>Dad, I think that</i> he

00:15.327 --> 00:18.359
<i>is the first person</i>
<i>who's ever really gotten me.</i>

00:18.360 --> 00:21.892
Which one of you stole
my fucking drugs?

00:21.893 --> 00:24.859
Nobody stole your fucking drugs.
Okay? I'm out. Have a good life.

00:24.860 --> 00:27.059
<i>You're mine forever.</i>

00:27.060 --> 00:28.159
<i>They think they can just</i>
<i>get rid of me?</i>

00:28.160 --> 00:30.459
<i>I was the linchpin behind</i>

00:30.460 --> 00:33.259
that shit show.
Whoa, whoa.

00:33.260 --> 00:35.159
- She got fired.
<i>- Our guys are looking to trade</i>

00:35.160 --> 00:38.359
<i>their hard-earned credibility</i>
<i>for a big ol' payday.</i>

00:38.360 --> 00:42.226
<i>Little wrinkle here: they</i>
<i>started on a street corner.</i>

00:42.227 --> 00:43.459
Drug dealers.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.326
Lukas is all,
"DollaHyde my baby."

00:45.327 --> 00:47.126
I want him out.

00:47.127 --> 00:49.192
Lukas knows Dre is trying
to push him out of the company.

00:49.193 --> 00:51.126
<i>If we're gonna make a move</i>
<i>to win him over, Marty,</i>

00:51.127 --> 00:52.326
we gotta do it now.

00:52.327 --> 00:52.992
Call Marty.

00:52.993 --> 00:54.892
Tell him that...

00:54.893 --> 00:59.292
you'll sign away DollaHyde but
only under the follow condition.

00:59.293 --> 01:00.826
<i>Lukas is going to be asking</i>

01:00.827 --> 01:03.226
for $150 million.

01:03.227 --> 01:05.292
Lukas is gone as soon
as he gets the cash.

01:05.293 --> 01:06.892
Cash that Dre doesn't have.

01:06.893 --> 01:08.860
Then I guess
you're Lukas's bitch.

01:10.527 --> 01:12.626
<i>- Continue to roll.</i>
<i>- We need B-roll.</i>

01:12.627 --> 01:15.259
<i>Lukas, it's not cute.</i>
<i>No. It's not cute. Exactly. Stop.</i>

01:15.260 --> 01:17.126
No, no, no.
Continue to roll.

01:17.127 --> 01:18.627
- Turn this...
- Shut it off.

01:20.227 --> 01:23.260
Hey. This is gold. Keep rolling.
Goddamn it.

01:26.427 --> 01:29.793
Turn this fucking thing off!

01:34.060 --> 01:37.492
Wait.

01:37.493 --> 01:40.459
So what are you saying, Marty?
I'm saying

01:40.460 --> 01:42.559
that many places... well,

01:42.560 --> 01:44.992
how 'bout just every
fucking bank in the world...

01:44.993 --> 01:46.792
does not want to make this loan
with your boy Lukas.

01:46.793 --> 01:48.992
He's had fucking felonies, man.

01:48.993 --> 01:52.026
His drug ties, his goddamn gun-running.
Right. But what about

01:52.027 --> 01:54.260
your client, uh,
uh, U.S. National?

01:54.284 --> 01:57.716
You told me you had 'em all in your pocket.
Yeah, well, uh...

01:57.717 --> 02:00.650
turns out this deal is way too
black for them. That motherfucker

02:00.651 --> 02:03.783
has poisoned the whole goddamn
universe against DollaHyde.

02:03.784 --> 02:05.916
Listen, the universe
is huge, okay?

02:05.917 --> 02:09.650
We just need to find some...
high-net-worth,

02:09.651 --> 02:11.616
non-risk-averse
players.

02:11.617 --> 02:14.083
You know, I didn't want to
have to make this play,

02:14.084 --> 02:16.716
but I've been thinking on it.

02:16.717 --> 02:17.751
I got the guy.

02:19.184 --> 02:20.083
Zhang.

02:20.084 --> 02:22.083
Zhang?
Zhang.

02:22.084 --> 02:23.583
He don't sound like a local.

02:23.584 --> 02:25.383
Not exactly.
He's out of Guanzhou.

02:25.384 --> 02:27.350
Oh, great. Right back
to fucking China.

02:27.351 --> 02:29.616
Oh, no, no, no.
This is a solo trip.

02:29.617 --> 02:31.816
Zhang, he doesn't dig strangers,

02:31.817 --> 02:33.350
so I'm going in alone.
He's offered

02:33.351 --> 02:35.983
to be a silent partner, he's offered
loans, manufacturing partnerships...

02:35.984 --> 02:38.050
the man knows

02:38.051 --> 02:40.850
we're sitting on a gold mine
with DollaHyde.

02:40.851 --> 02:42.716
You really think
he can get this money?

02:42.717 --> 02:44.283
I mean the whole nut.

02:44.284 --> 02:46.616
I think, if I go to him...

02:46.617 --> 02:48.916
and kiss his ass just right,

02:48.917 --> 02:51.083
I can get this goddamn money,

02:51.084 --> 02:54.916
even if I'm not...
thrilled about his terms.

02:54.917 --> 02:56.751
Well, smooch, smooch.

02:58.117 --> 02:59.583
Yeah.

02:59.584 --> 03:01.583
I'll get on a plane today.

03:01.584 --> 03:03.750
In the meantime, why don't you
grab a driver out of that bag

03:03.751 --> 03:05.651
and I can show you
how to hit a real golf ball.

03:09.551 --> 03:11.483
Oh.

03:11.484 --> 03:12.916
All right, Grandpa.
I'm here. Huh?

03:12.917 --> 03:14.050
Oh, my God, look...
What? What?

03:14.051 --> 03:15.516
Oh, oh. Yeah. Okay,
I'm cool, I'm cool.

03:15.517 --> 03:16.750
Yeah.
Bye.

03:16.751 --> 03:18.683
Take care, man.
I'll see you. Bye, Chantelle.

03:18.684 --> 03:20.450
Hey, Gramps.

03:20.451 --> 03:22.283
What it is?
Well, hey,

03:22.284 --> 03:24.616
Lex. Beautiful day, huh?

03:24.617 --> 03:25.950
Hadn't noticed.

03:25.951 --> 03:28.383
Hey, Roscoe.

03:28.384 --> 03:30.350
"Hey, Roscoe."

03:30.351 --> 03:32.183
Hey, Lex.
Hey, Coltrane.

03:32.184 --> 03:34.716
So, they're, uh... they're
doing the 818 again tonight,

03:34.717 --> 03:36.483
that krumping thing in the
Valley I was telling you about.

03:36.484 --> 03:38.916
It's pretty sick.
You should come by.

03:38.917 --> 03:40.383
You could throw down some moves
if you want.

03:40.384 --> 03:43.083
Yeah... Sounds super edgy, Jazz Hands.
Wouldn't miss it.

03:43.084 --> 03:46.016
I was talking to Roscoe, Lex.
Yeah, Coltrane, yeah, we'll come down.

03:46.017 --> 03:49.316
We'll check it out.
I'm gonna wear my clown makeup.

03:49.317 --> 03:50.716
- It's not like that.
- It's just...

03:50.717 --> 03:52.850
It's labbing, trying new stuff,
throwing down.

03:52.851 --> 03:54.650
'Cause you two have
something to krump about?

03:54.651 --> 03:56.683
Whatever. See you, Roscoe.

03:56.684 --> 03:58.883
- See you, Coltrane.
- See you, Roscoe.

03:58.884 --> 04:01.316
I am so glad

04:01.317 --> 04:02.683
I'm not 14 anymore.

04:02.684 --> 04:04.183
You're close, though.

04:04.184 --> 04:06.050
Oh, you did... Come on!

04:06.051 --> 04:08.551

04:24.117 --> 04:26.084
Hi!

04:27.117 --> 04:29.084
Hello?

04:32.451 --> 04:35.150
Excuse me. Um...

04:35.151 --> 04:37.016
Hey, where the fuck is Marty

04:37.017 --> 04:38.783
and why have I been waiting
for ten minutes?

04:38.784 --> 04:40.383
Hi, Ms. Talbot.

04:40.384 --> 04:41.650
You're adorable.
Oh.

04:41.651 --> 04:43.350
Thank you.
Now, where the fuck is Marty?

04:43.351 --> 04:45.316
As a top-tier
consultant,

04:45.317 --> 04:47.783
you know all about putting out
fires at the highest level.

04:47.784 --> 04:51.083
This morning, Marty had
a five-alarm predawn fire.

04:51.084 --> 04:52.850
And he is just finishing

04:52.851 --> 04:54.583
that up right now, and he
should be back any minute.

04:54.584 --> 04:57.016
I'm sorry, who are you?
I'm Caitlin Hobart.

04:57.017 --> 04:59.750
I'm one of the junior analysts
here at Kaan and Associates.

04:59.751 --> 05:02.383
I don't care if you're bouncing
up and down on Marty's cock.

05:02.384 --> 05:04.116
I want to know why he's not here

05:04.117 --> 05:06.850
right now.

05:06.851 --> 05:09.583
I am paying full freight for Kaan
and Associates for this consult.

05:09.584 --> 05:12.283
Not Associates,
<i>Kaan</i> and Associates.

05:12.284 --> 05:13.850
Certainly not junior

05:13.851 --> 05:16.483
fucking associates.
Right. Understandable.

05:16.484 --> 05:20.283
Um... So, I thought that you
and I could just start by

05:20.284 --> 05:23.483
just chunking out
a journey line and...

05:23.484 --> 05:25.950
Look into my eyes.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.650
Uh-huh.
What do you see?

05:27.651 --> 05:30.616
I see...

05:30.617 --> 05:33.850
You see a woman who was stabbed

05:33.851 --> 05:36.550
by her junior analyst.

05:36.551 --> 05:38.783
You see a woman
who will never be stabbed again.

05:38.784 --> 05:39.883
Do you know why?

05:39.884 --> 05:41.316
I'm so sorry.

05:41.317 --> 05:43.817
Because I will stab first.

05:49.217 --> 05:50.516
What'd I miss?

05:50.517 --> 05:52.850
Well, hey, Tiger Woods.
What's up?

05:52.851 --> 05:54.283
Was it a golf fire?

05:54.284 --> 05:56.384
Come on.

06:06.784 --> 06:08.383
Oh, keep walking, coward.

06:08.384 --> 06:09.984
Hey, Mon?

06:11.617 --> 06:13.616
You're on the clock, so, uh...

06:13.617 --> 06:14.584
what do you got?

06:15.984 --> 06:17.416
This right here

06:17.417 --> 06:19.083
is gonna make me fucking rich.

06:19.084 --> 06:20.883
Is it full of magic beans?

06:20.884 --> 06:22.650
No. It's full of...

06:22.651 --> 06:25.516
WON. W-O-N.

06:25.517 --> 06:27.350
Stands for
"Wholesome Organic Nutrition."

06:27.351 --> 06:29.850
Or...

06:29.851 --> 06:31.250
like Monica just WON
the lottery.

06:31.251 --> 06:34.683
Or Monica just WON
a $20 million payday.

06:34.684 --> 06:36.416
But also like it is the one,

06:36.417 --> 06:39.050
the only thing you ever have
to eat or drink for the rest

06:39.051 --> 06:42.150
of your fucking days.

06:42.151 --> 06:43.516
And since you no longer have

06:43.517 --> 06:44.816
to cook or eat,

06:44.817 --> 06:47.550
you are free to spend more time
blogging about your...

06:47.551 --> 06:49.083
meaningless life.

06:49.084 --> 06:51.583
That's a great pitch.
Mm-hmm, insofar as it sounds like,

06:51.584 --> 06:53.650
well, every other protein
powder on the market,

06:53.651 --> 06:55.883
I think. Yeah.
As far as I can tell,

06:55.884 --> 06:57.616
it is.
But it doesn't matter

06:57.617 --> 07:01.283
because the fucking Millennials
are gobbling this shit up.

07:01.284 --> 07:04.050
Oh, but Millennials
don't gobble anything up.

07:04.051 --> 07:06.651
Hmm. Well, maybe we should
just take a look at this shit.

07:08.717 --> 07:10.083
No.
Bam.

07:10.084 --> 07:11.116
There's no way that...

07:11.117 --> 07:12.516
This looks like gobbling to me.

07:12.517 --> 07:14.383
Hallelujah.

07:14.384 --> 07:17.250
I have achieved wood.

07:17.251 --> 07:19.416
Oh, my God, he's not kidding.

07:19.417 --> 07:21.583
Monica, did you make
these numbers up?

07:21.584 --> 07:23.950
I mean, does anything up
there even resemble reality?

07:23.951 --> 07:25.483
Oh, this is vetted.

07:25.484 --> 07:28.116
This is so vetted I have
deferred my normal fee,

07:28.117 --> 07:30.816
and I am taking
some massive stock options.

07:30.817 --> 07:32.550
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Uh, kiddies,

07:32.551 --> 07:35.283
can you please tell Monica the
number one rule in consulting?

07:35.284 --> 07:36.083
No freebies.
No freebies.

07:36.084 --> 07:37.183
No inappropriate touching.

07:37.184 --> 07:39.016
No... freebies.
No freebies.

07:39.017 --> 07:40.916
I'm the big-dicked bitch
that made up the rules, Marty,

07:40.917 --> 07:42.484
and I am telling you...

07:43.251 --> 07:44.983
...this is a grand slam.

07:44.984 --> 07:48.417
I just need your team to
get me to that IPO and...

07:49.551 --> 07:51.250
Let me just...

07:51.251 --> 07:53.250
Sorry.

07:53.251 --> 07:56.250
Just try... I mean, those
numbers are, uh, compelling.

07:56.251 --> 07:59.284
I'll give it right back.
Sure. No, you can keep that one.

08:05.751 --> 08:07.816
Oh.
My God.

08:07.817 --> 08:10.116
Come on.
She's not that bad.

08:10.117 --> 08:11.316
She's not that bad?

08:11.317 --> 08:13.250
I have looked the fucking
Medusa in her face.

08:13.251 --> 08:16.850
She's not that fucking bad.
Well, what do you care?

08:16.851 --> 08:19.483
I mean, you've got your Special
Lady, huh? Y-your big account.

08:19.484 --> 08:21.850
Do me a favor. Don't call her
my "Special Lady."

08:21.851 --> 08:24.016
Why? But, yeah, no, you know what?
Things are going

08:24.017 --> 08:25.383
actually pretty good.
All right.

08:25.384 --> 08:26.916
And things are going <i> very</i> well

08:26.917 --> 08:29.150
in the old "throw my sausage
into her vagina" department.

08:29.151 --> 08:31.983
Oh, yeah, tell me less.
I can't.

08:31.984 --> 08:34.816
I told you everything there is. Yeah,
I know... it was too much, it was too much.

08:34.817 --> 08:38.482
Okay, that's my fault. Yeah, she's kind
of cute and all, if you're cool with, uh,

08:38.484 --> 08:40.450
tying yourself down.
"Tying yourself down"?

08:40.451 --> 08:42.216
Yeah. You know, just because
you fucked things up

08:42.217 --> 08:44.015
with a girl who actually wanted
to marry you

08:44.017 --> 08:47.083
and... even more shocking... was
willing to have sex with you

08:47.084 --> 08:48.683
doesn't mean I should send Marissa packing.
Do you remember

08:48.684 --> 08:50.516
when you were single and
Doug the Gugg was your wingman

08:50.517 --> 08:51.616
and the two of us got...

08:51.617 --> 08:53.016
Doug the Gugg
was never my wingman.

08:53.017 --> 08:54.784
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

08:58.151 --> 09:00.150
Don't. Don't, pl...

09:00.151 --> 09:02.716
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

09:02.717 --> 09:04.383
There's the Puss 'N Goots.

09:04.384 --> 09:05.850
I don't want to talk
to Puss 'N Goots.

09:05.851 --> 09:07.183
No, he doesn't hunt alone.

09:07.184 --> 09:10.950
Nuh-uh. He's looking
for Claude Oberholt.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.716
Where is he?
Claude Oberholt. Yes.

09:12.717 --> 09:14.650
And he's talking about
his right paw man

09:14.651 --> 09:16.550
looking for little
chicks to hunt and kill.

09:16.551 --> 09:18.416
What? Is this really you,
Pussy 'N Goots?

09:18.417 --> 09:19.450
Going around look for pussy.
We're gonna look for some shit.

09:19.451 --> 09:20.583
What do you do

09:20.584 --> 09:22.383
when you see a big pussy?
What do you do when you see

09:22.384 --> 09:23.983
a big dick?

09:23.984 --> 09:25.583
What do you do
when you see a pussy?

09:25.584 --> 09:28.516
Oh, yeah, there it is.
It's ol' Cats. He's back, baby.

09:28.517 --> 09:29.550
He's back.

09:29.551 --> 09:31.583
What-what would you do
if Lukas Frye was around?

09:31.584 --> 09:32.783
This is Puss 'N Goots, man.

09:32.784 --> 09:35.316
Lukas Frye don't scare
Puss 'N Goots.

09:35.317 --> 09:37.483
Uh-uh. He can
kiss my Rum Tum

09:37.484 --> 09:39.050
Tugger ass.
He can? Just like that?

09:39.051 --> 09:40.483
Puss 'N Goots only cares
about pussy,

09:40.484 --> 09:41.850
not <i> pussies,</i> like Lukas Frye.

09:41.851 --> 09:43.116
Boo!
Huh? God!

09:43.117 --> 09:44.250
Hey, man.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.883
Uh, I'm sorry. You...

09:45.884 --> 09:47.083
This is what we pay you to do?

09:47.084 --> 09:48.250
You should see your face.

09:48.251 --> 09:49.416
You're lucky
I got a sense of humor.

09:49.417 --> 09:50.750
I pegged you for a <i> Cats</i> fan.

09:50.751 --> 09:52.216
Am-am I right?
So, I was...

09:52.217 --> 09:54.383
I was, um, uh, Rum Tug Tugger.

09:54.384 --> 09:56.450
Mm. And he was a character
based on Mick Jagger.

09:56.451 --> 09:57.683
Jesus Christ.
Do you have any idea

09:57.684 --> 09:58.883
how much you're
digging your own grave?

09:58.884 --> 10:00.416
I do, yeah.
So go get Marty.

10:00.417 --> 10:02.083
Yes. Okay, okay.
All right, hold up, man. Now don't go.

10:02.084 --> 10:04.983
I'll be back. Stay right there.
Nobody move.

10:04.984 --> 10:06.550
Uh, Lukas. Hold on.

10:06.551 --> 10:07.783
Um, Lukas?

10:07.784 --> 10:09.550
Lukas, Lukas,
ah, let me explain.

10:09.551 --> 10:10.716
Hold on. Hold on.

10:10.717 --> 10:11.916
The fuck...?
Will, handle this, please.

10:11.917 --> 10:13.750
Copy that.

10:13.751 --> 10:16.050
I'm more of Mungojerrie or Rumpleteazer
man myself. What did I tell you?

10:16.051 --> 10:18.316
You get that? You get that?
What is this?

10:18.317 --> 10:20.083
- What the fuck is this?
- Quite a little show you brought

10:20.084 --> 10:22.583
in here today. You forget we had a meeting
on the books today?

10:22.584 --> 10:23.816
No, I-I didn't forget.

10:23.817 --> 10:25.650
I just figured you'd
be back at DollaHyde,

10:25.651 --> 10:27.783
you know, holding your company
hostage, bleeding it dry.

10:27.784 --> 10:30.316
Mm. One
of the few things

10:30.317 --> 10:32.950
I like about you, Marty...
you have a sense of humor.

10:32.951 --> 10:34.516
Oh, you got a sense
of humor, too.

10:34.517 --> 10:36.383
I mean, you took time
out of your busy day

10:36.384 --> 10:37.683
to come all the way down here

10:37.684 --> 10:39.050
and just shit all
over my company.

10:39.051 --> 10:40.750
You are mighty angry for
a super-white black dude.

10:40.751 --> 10:41.916
You know that?

10:41.917 --> 10:43.250
But to answer your question,

10:43.251 --> 10:45.116
it's because
I'm paying for all this.

10:45.117 --> 10:46.483
I figure we'd keep
the meeting today,

10:46.484 --> 10:47.750
and I can introduce you to my

10:47.751 --> 10:50.850
documentarist, Shane Boorstein.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.350
Oh, that's great.

10:52.351 --> 10:53.116
Shake-cam, and...

10:53.117 --> 10:54.950
All right.

10:54.951 --> 10:56.316
Hey, man,
we are gonna win the shit

10:56.317 --> 10:58.450
out of Sundance
with this shit, man.

10:58.451 --> 10:59.616
Congratulations in advance.

10:59.617 --> 11:00.983
Oh, this is fucking awesome.

11:00.984 --> 11:04.916
Marty, Shawty, see this?

11:04.917 --> 11:06.750
This whole world you
got here with this shit...

11:06.751 --> 11:08.050
this is bullshit.

11:08.051 --> 11:09.783
It is fictitious,
it lacks substance.

11:09.784 --> 11:11.983
It's not real.
It's not me.

11:11.984 --> 11:13.350
You getting all this?
I mean,

11:13.351 --> 11:14.883
Jesus Christ, Denzel, go.

11:14.884 --> 11:18.616
I know Dre is in China
grinding on Zhang for the money.

11:18.617 --> 11:20.283
Fish much?

11:20.284 --> 11:22.416
My shit goes deep throat,
Marty Kaan.

11:22.417 --> 11:24.416
Just try to assume
that I know everything.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.050
But relax.

11:26.051 --> 11:28.250
Y'all are still repping
DollaHyde, correct?

11:28.251 --> 11:29.650
Yeah, that's correct.

11:29.651 --> 11:31.516
So, why is it
that you meet with Dre,

11:31.517 --> 11:33.750
you conspire with Dre,
you hold hands

11:33.751 --> 11:35.816
and skip around
in his wine cellar together,

11:35.817 --> 11:37.783
but you don't know who we are?

11:37.784 --> 11:40.083
I know who you are.

11:40.084 --> 11:42.350
How? From growing up on the
mean streets of Hancock Park?

11:42.351 --> 11:43.717
That how you know?

11:45.317 --> 11:47.183
Your little boyfriend
is out of the country,

11:47.184 --> 11:48.883
so let's take this
as an opportunity

11:48.884 --> 11:50.450
to show you where it get real.

11:50.451 --> 11:53.483
See what I'm doing
with my people in my hood.

11:53.484 --> 11:55.316
Bring your Armani
asses to Compton,

11:55.317 --> 11:58.550
we'll settle this shit once
and for all in my house.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.383
Um, but your house
is in Beverly Hills.

12:01.384 --> 12:02.850
Man, shut the fuck up, Doug!

12:02.851 --> 12:04.416
Hey, man,
cut that part out, man.

12:04.417 --> 12:05.683
Since the idea
of coming to Compton

12:05.684 --> 12:06.950
got your ass
all shook up, man...

12:06.951 --> 12:09.116
No, no, no, Lukas,
we would love to see what

12:09.117 --> 12:10.016
you are up to
in the neighborhood.

12:10.017 --> 12:11.316
We-We would?
Yes, we would.

12:11.317 --> 12:12.316
Would we?
Let's-let's go.

12:12.317 --> 12:14.250
Let's go.
Right now?

12:14.251 --> 12:15.716
Well, I'm gonna text
you the address on MapQuest.

12:15.717 --> 12:17.550
Have fun.
Let's go, Doug.

12:17.551 --> 12:19.584
Goddamn it. Hey.

12:25.717 --> 12:27.750
Oh, my God.

12:27.751 --> 12:29.583
Wow.

12:29.584 --> 12:31.551
This is fucking awesome.

12:33.217 --> 12:36.183
Uh, you know what? I'm just
gonna go ahead and shoot myself,

12:36.184 --> 12:37.350
save someone the trouble.

12:37.351 --> 12:38.516
Or I can shoot you.

12:38.517 --> 12:40.183
I mean, it's been
on my bucket list forever.

12:40.184 --> 12:41.383
I just want to kill you.

12:41.384 --> 12:42.516
Yeah, this isn't cool.

12:42.517 --> 12:43.783
Guys, just relax, oaky?

12:43.784 --> 12:45.950
This is all a part of
Lukas's passion play.

12:45.951 --> 12:49.150
He wants to put us in danger,
then he gets to come save us.

12:49.151 --> 12:51.983
Okay, or he won't,
and we'll all die out here.

12:51.984 --> 12:53.283
Shut up, Doug.

12:53.284 --> 12:54.483
Shit. Get down!

12:54.484 --> 12:57.584
It's a Mercedes, you idiot.

13:02.584 --> 13:04.150
See y'all finally made it.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.316
You see right here?

13:05.317 --> 13:06.816
This where I met Dre.

13:06.817 --> 13:10.584
Ten years old,
already corner boys.

13:13.184 --> 13:15.416
A'ight, man,
first of many things to see.

13:15.417 --> 13:17.784
Let's go.

13:21.476 --> 13:23.116
You're not gonna kill us
in here, are you?

13:23.117 --> 13:24.916
Nah. I don't want
to mess up my seats.

13:24.917 --> 13:26.483
See, I brought you
here 'cause I wanted

13:26.484 --> 13:30.016
to show you motherfuckers
what's real... to me.

13:30.017 --> 13:33.116
And this is it.

13:33.117 --> 13:35.117
Compton.

13:36.651 --> 13:39.616
All the rest of the bullshit,
man... it's just an illusion.

13:39.617 --> 13:41.950
Just like a shot of
heroin, you know?

13:41.951 --> 13:43.650
Makes your world all pretty,

13:43.651 --> 13:46.383
make you feel much
better for a minute.

13:46.384 --> 13:49.116
Then, after that, goes away.

13:49.117 --> 13:51.583
It's over with;
dissipates.

13:51.584 --> 13:54.016
You're back to your reality.

13:54.017 --> 13:57.684
You lose sight of that,
you lose everything.

14:00.917 --> 14:02.883
Yeah.

14:02.884 --> 14:04.884
This is where we from.

14:06.651 --> 14:08.651
A'ight, man, let's go.

14:09.617 --> 14:13.116
This is it.

14:13.117 --> 14:15.250
<i>It's where I'm from.</i>

14:15.251 --> 14:17.083
It's where your new BFF
is from, too, Marty.

14:17.084 --> 14:20.083
Whether he chooses
to acknowledge it or not.

14:20.084 --> 14:22.350
<i>This is where it began.</i>

14:22.351 --> 14:24.384
And this is where it should end.

14:30.284 --> 14:33.750
In here, we have
the largest hip-hop clothing

14:33.751 --> 14:36.250
manufacturing plant
in the United States.

14:36.251 --> 14:39.716
Well, that is,
up until about seven years ago,

14:39.717 --> 14:41.316
when Dre just up and decided

14:41.317 --> 14:43.616
he wanted to move all of our
production overseas and shit.

14:43.617 --> 14:45.850
I still keep a few hundred
people on payroll, man.

14:45.851 --> 14:48.450
You know what I'm saying? Just
to make sure they can have jobs

14:48.451 --> 14:50.016
and health care and whatnot.

14:50.017 --> 14:51.616
Fill a few orders
every now and again.

14:51.617 --> 14:53.216
I got to. If not me,

14:53.217 --> 14:54.850
who else gonna do it?

14:54.851 --> 14:56.750
Why would I want to do
some shit like that

14:56.751 --> 14:58.283
when I could just sell
for $50 million

14:58.284 --> 15:00.316
and run off to Barney's?

15:00.317 --> 15:01.816
Hey, man, what's going on?

15:01.817 --> 15:02.850
He's amazing.

15:02.851 --> 15:05.316
What, does this guy feed
and clothe the hungry?

15:05.317 --> 15:07.083
Yeah, and heal the sick.

15:07.084 --> 15:09.183
This is a financial
sinkhole, man.

15:09.184 --> 15:11.550
Doug, is this place for real?

15:11.551 --> 15:13.683
Uh, yeah.
It's on the DollaHyde books.

15:13.684 --> 15:15.316
Hey, well, hey, man,
I got to run, man.

15:15.317 --> 15:17.116
Them dollars ain't gonna
hop in my pocket.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.283
Y'all take it light.
Another thing.

15:19.284 --> 15:20.683
Do you know
that Dre's motherfucking ass

15:20.684 --> 15:24.283
has not been to this place
since we moved production?

15:24.284 --> 15:27.550
Not once. What kind of guy
would do a thing like that

15:27.551 --> 15:29.850
to all these people?

15:29.851 --> 15:31.283
In his defense,
he's probably just busy,

15:31.284 --> 15:32.816
off in China trying
to save his ass

15:32.817 --> 15:34.216
from Mr. Zhang and shit, right?

15:34.217 --> 15:35.583
You keep saying
that fucking name.

15:35.584 --> 15:36.824
I... What are you
talking about?

15:37.917 --> 15:39.550
That sense of humor gig.

15:39.551 --> 15:41.016
Come on, everybody
get in the car, man.

15:41.017 --> 15:42.250
Come on, man.

15:42.251 --> 15:44.250
Get in, get in.
Come one, come all, man.

15:44.251 --> 15:45.983
I'm a consultant, as well,

15:45.984 --> 15:48.350
so, any bullshit
that you feed me,

15:48.351 --> 15:51.116
I've already fed
to someone else.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.050
I know what you're going to say

15:53.051 --> 15:55.783
before it even comes out of your

15:55.784 --> 15:57.450
lie-holes.
Does that make sense?

15:57.451 --> 15:58.850
You got it, Monica.

15:58.851 --> 16:00.483
We'll start grinding
on these models.

16:00.484 --> 16:01.983
Great.
And certainly Jeffrey

16:01.984 --> 16:04.216
and I can start with a white
paper and just brain-dump...

16:04.217 --> 16:06.116
What did I just say...?

16:06.117 --> 16:06.984
Bullshit.

16:07.817 --> 16:08.883
Bullshit.

16:08.884 --> 16:10.783
That was bullshit.
Good boy.

16:10.784 --> 16:12.384
Thank you.

16:16.417 --> 16:18.516
Mmm.

16:18.517 --> 16:19.783
Can I talk to you for a second?

16:19.784 --> 16:21.251
I think she's nice.

16:32.851 --> 16:34.483
And hey, hey, that's Bludso's

16:34.484 --> 16:35.650
right there, man.

16:35.651 --> 16:37.083
That's where we came up with

16:37.084 --> 16:38.916
the name DollaHyde.

16:38.917 --> 16:41.816
Yeah.
There was this guy, man.

16:41.817 --> 16:43.483
His name was Douglas Dollarhide.

16:43.484 --> 16:45.816
He became the first black mayor
of Compton.

16:45.817 --> 16:48.316
<i>So we get to printing up</i>
<i>our little logos</i>

16:48.317 --> 16:49.683
on the T-shirts and shit,
start selling 'em

16:49.684 --> 16:51.850
out the trunk of my car
right there in the front.

16:51.851 --> 16:54.316
All of 'em smelled
like barbeque.

16:54.317 --> 16:55.816
Uh-oh.

16:55.817 --> 16:57.616
That probably why we couldn't

16:57.617 --> 16:59.284
print enough of them
motherfuckers.

17:04.817 --> 17:06.717
This corner right there.

17:08.784 --> 17:10.383
Ooh, I was walking
with the homies, man.

17:10.384 --> 17:11.516
I think it was, uh, me,

17:11.517 --> 17:13.483
Dre and-and Ronnie,

17:13.483 --> 17:16.349
and Ronnie's going on
about how one day,

17:16.351 --> 17:18.717
the Clippers are gonna
be a great team.

17:20.050 --> 17:22.383
This nigger was funny
as shit, man. I'm talking,

17:22.384 --> 17:24.250
fuck-Richard-Pryor funny, man.

17:24.251 --> 17:28.183
Way, way out in the distance,
we hear, "Pah!"

17:28.184 --> 17:29.716
Ronnie dropped to the ground.

17:29.717 --> 17:31.016
I look at him, and I say,

17:31.017 --> 17:32.616
"Man, look at you.
You just spilled soda

17:32.617 --> 17:35.384
all over yourself trying
to motherfucking get a laugh."

17:36.617 --> 17:38.783
Man, and then,
we turned around again,

17:38.784 --> 17:42.016
and seen Ronnie wasn't
getting up.

17:42.017 --> 17:43.783
Ronnie had been shot.

17:43.784 --> 17:47.916
In the hood, it's as simple as,

17:47.917 --> 17:49.650
one minute you talking
to your friend,

17:49.651 --> 17:51.816
and then, the next minute,

17:51.817 --> 17:54.183
all the jokes stop

17:54.184 --> 17:55.684
forever.

18:01.217 --> 18:03.983
A'ight, man. We here.

18:03.984 --> 18:05.383
Where is "here?"
Come on.

18:05.384 --> 18:07.516
Stick close to me,
try not to get shot.

18:07.517 --> 18:09.283
What's up, G?

18:09.284 --> 18:11.617
Hey, they with me.

18:13.751 --> 18:16.116
One and all, please, this way.

18:16.117 --> 18:19.283
Last but not least
on our trip down memory lane.

18:19.284 --> 18:20.416
What's happening, guy?

18:20.417 --> 18:22.216
It bring me a great
honor and pleasure

18:22.217 --> 18:23.616
to introduce you

18:23.617 --> 18:25.083
to Ronjon's Lounge.

18:25.084 --> 18:27.216
Now, for our first
couple years, this...

18:27.217 --> 18:30.083
thing of beauty that you see
before you right now

18:30.084 --> 18:33.950
was the DollaHyde office.
It's amazing.

18:33.951 --> 18:35.183
- It's nice.
- It's where it all began.

18:35.184 --> 18:37.083
Can we get the fuck
out of here, please?

18:37.084 --> 18:39.116
Man, cool it.
I mean, I know

18:39.117 --> 18:41.083
real can get real scary for you

18:41.084 --> 18:42.383
when you, you know, had those

18:42.384 --> 18:44.183
bougie academics
for parents, Marty.

18:44.184 --> 18:46.183
Well, an orthopedist
and a teacher.

18:46.184 --> 18:47.483
I'm scared, too.

18:47.484 --> 18:49.116
No, real is when you're
not full of shit.

18:49.117 --> 18:51.216
Okay? Whatever
theatrical this is,

18:51.217 --> 18:53.583
it's over. We're done.
Uh, no,

18:53.584 --> 18:55.183
Let's just finish, please, Go.

18:55.184 --> 18:56.650
what we came here to do.

18:56.651 --> 18:58.216
You are
an intelligent man, Lukas.

18:58.217 --> 18:59.683
Tell us what the play is here?

18:59.684 --> 19:01.216
You've been dancing
around it all day, man.

19:01.217 --> 19:02.750
Just tell us what
the fuck is going on.

19:02.751 --> 19:04.583
That is the sound

19:04.584 --> 19:06.350
of my heart breaking.

19:06.351 --> 19:08.116
Here I am, trying to bond,

19:08.117 --> 19:10.650
trying to share, being sincere.

19:10.651 --> 19:12.416
Well, I tell you what.

19:12.417 --> 19:14.316
You may as well pull up
a seat and have a drink.

19:14.317 --> 19:15.383
Get you some popcorn.

19:15.384 --> 19:16.683
Because this movie of mine

19:16.684 --> 19:19.150
is about to reach the
motherfucking climax.

19:19.151 --> 19:21.183
Come on, man.
Round of Hennessy for everybody.

19:21.184 --> 19:23.150
No cups, out the bottle.
Like the old times.

19:23.151 --> 19:25.350
- Oh, no, no, no.
- We're civilized.

19:25.351 --> 19:26.616
I'll just get a Pimm's and soda.

19:26.617 --> 19:28.150
Uh, I mean,
you're buying, right?

19:28.151 --> 19:30.050
I'm asking.

19:30.051 --> 19:31.083
Oh, you're so gonna die.

19:31.084 --> 19:32.516
No, you're gonna die.

19:32.517 --> 19:34.516
What do you care if I'm a
guy or a girl, douche bag?

19:34.517 --> 19:35.683
You're probably some
old pervert, anyway.

19:35.684 --> 19:38.816
Do they have any
idea we're even here?

19:38.817 --> 19:40.516
Oh, no.
Total immersion.

19:40.517 --> 19:41.783
Yeah!

19:41.784 --> 19:44.417
Smoked your ass, pervert.

19:47.284 --> 19:49.350
So you want to check out that

19:49.351 --> 19:51.150
whole 818 thing tonight?

19:51.151 --> 19:52.817
Um, let me think. No.

19:53.917 --> 19:55.250
Sounds pretty cool, actually.

19:55.251 --> 19:57.150
Well, yeah, if you're into that

19:57.151 --> 19:58.783
drama geek shit.

19:58.784 --> 20:00.650
Honey, I'll be
right back. Hmm?

20:00.651 --> 20:03.016
Hmm?
Yeah.

20:03.017 --> 20:06.050
I'll drive you,
you can Uber back.

20:06.051 --> 20:07.950
I didn't even say we were going.

20:07.951 --> 20:09.616
Yeah, I know you didn't.

20:09.617 --> 20:11.417
I did. Huh?
Come on.

20:12.917 --> 20:14.150
Awesome.

20:14.151 --> 20:16.417
Thanks, Grandpa.

20:22.317 --> 20:23.750
Let's go, y'all, back this way.

20:23.751 --> 20:25.683
Hey, walk, y'all. Shit.

20:25.684 --> 20:28.116
You know, I figured you all
wanted to meet Mr. Zhang,

20:28.117 --> 20:31.916
since he'll be such a big part
of your lives and all,

20:31.917 --> 20:33.716
so I took the liberty
of digging us a hole

20:33.717 --> 20:35.157
in the back.
We're gonna go to China.

20:42.784 --> 20:44.951
Hey, make sure the cameras
and shit get in here, too.

20:46.417 --> 20:47.883
The fuck you doing here?

20:47.884 --> 20:49.850
What the fuck?
You know,

20:49.851 --> 20:52.250
you are one low-down
piece of shit.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.950
Excuse me, I'm being rude,
I'm sorry.

20:53.951 --> 20:55.216
Ladies, gentlemen...
Mr. Zhang.

20:55.217 --> 20:56.683
Wait a minute, so,

20:56.684 --> 20:58.083
so this guy's Chinese
on his mother's side?

20:58.084 --> 21:00.816
Marty, listen.
Marty, this here's Lovey.

21:00.817 --> 21:04.083
Lovey is the man in the hood
you come to when you need money.

21:04.084 --> 21:06.150
Lukas, why don't you

21:06.151 --> 21:09.216
and your bitch-ass lawyers...

21:09.217 --> 21:13.116
get the fuck out of here so I can
finish up my business. I'm sorry, OG,

21:13.117 --> 21:15.950
excuse me, but I can't
do that, please forgive me.

21:15.951 --> 21:17.716
Let's keep this rolling.
And keep it real.

21:17.717 --> 21:19.116
Whoa, what the fuck is all this?

21:19.117 --> 21:20.383
What's going on
with these cameras?

21:20.384 --> 21:22.616
Get that fucking camera out my face.
Dre...

21:22.617 --> 21:26.483
call when you get
this shit settled, a'ight?

21:26.484 --> 21:28.216
Let's go!
Lovey. Come on, man.

21:28.217 --> 21:29.716
Look, I'm-a call you

21:29.717 --> 21:32.483
a little bit later, all right?
This is just some bullshit.

21:32.484 --> 21:35.583
You got to be kidding me.
It's unbelievable. That's what I'm saying.

21:35.584 --> 21:38.483
What the fuck did we talk about? You just
made it dirtier. What you talking about?

21:38.484 --> 21:40.850
I expect this dude to be a clown.
Get that fucking camera

21:40.851 --> 21:43.150
out of here. You come down to the gutter
to get the money?

21:43.151 --> 21:45.450
You're supposed to be in China right now.
And what was you gonna do

21:45.451 --> 21:48.016
about it? I came to you, you said all of
your resources are exhausted, right?

21:48.017 --> 21:50.283
Dre, you just made it worse.
So I got to get it the way...

21:50.284 --> 21:52.416
What the fuck care for, anyway?
You just made it worse.

21:52.417 --> 21:54.083
Hey, guys, guys, guys, guys,
guys, guys, guys. Come on, man.

21:54.084 --> 21:55.616
Oh, this your first fight.

21:55.617 --> 21:57.583
I feel personally
responsible, I'm sorry.

21:57.584 --> 22:00.016
If it's any consolation
to you, Marty, dig it.

22:00.017 --> 22:01.116
Never gonna sell.

22:01.117 --> 22:02.516
Under no circumstances.

22:02.517 --> 22:04.816
Ever. Okay?

22:04.817 --> 22:06.816
I just wanted to see
my guy run around the hood

22:06.817 --> 22:08.616
begging for money
like a little junkie.

22:08.617 --> 22:12.016
And to see Marty Kaan
scrambling to save

22:12.017 --> 22:14.216
his assimilated black ass.

22:14.217 --> 22:15.816
- Priceless.
- Well...

22:15.817 --> 22:18.050
there's no fucking way you guys
make it to an IPO now.

22:18.051 --> 22:20.116
There's no way you can go public
with either one of you

22:20.117 --> 22:22.350
being the face of the company.
Yeah, now you're stuck with each other.

22:22.351 --> 22:24.550
This is gonna be
fine, all right?

22:24.551 --> 22:28.216
We've had CEOs who hate each other
more than you two.

22:28.217 --> 22:30.416
This is the worst... fuck it,
this is the absolute worst.

22:30.417 --> 22:32.683
But we can make it work because
you don't have any other choice.

22:32.684 --> 22:34.716
Making it work...

22:34.717 --> 22:36.016
Not a problem for me.

22:36.017 --> 22:38.416
So, Andre here,
we got to worry about.

22:38.417 --> 22:40.650
No. You ain't
got to worry about Andre.

22:40.651 --> 22:43.583
It is what it is, right?
We'll get it done.

22:43.584 --> 22:45.883
But I know one thing's for sure,

22:45.884 --> 22:47.150
we not gonna be the...

22:47.151 --> 22:49.784
blood brothers on the corners
that we once were.

22:51.151 --> 22:52.984
We damn sure ain't
brothers no more.

23:01.017 --> 23:03.950
I told you there was a method
to my madness, now, see?

23:03.951 --> 23:05.983
Yeah, it was amazing.
Thank you.

23:05.984 --> 23:08.283
That the end of the excursion?

23:08.284 --> 23:09.416
That was pretty much my finale.

23:09.417 --> 23:10.450
Okay, fantastic.
Great, great.

23:10.451 --> 23:11.616
You got us, Martin Scorsese.

23:11.617 --> 23:13.183
We got Punk'd! Okay?

23:13.184 --> 23:15.416
Now cut the thing off.
No, no, no, no, no, no, continue to roll.

23:15.417 --> 23:17.116
We need B-roll.

23:17.117 --> 23:19.583
No, it's-it's not cute.
No. It's not cute, exactly. Stop.

23:19.584 --> 23:21.583
Stop tou... Stop touching the camera.
No, no, continue to roll.

23:21.584 --> 23:23.050
Turn this fucking...
Shut it off.

23:23.051 --> 23:24.783
Ow! Fuck! My face!

23:24.784 --> 23:27.150
Hey, hey. This is gold.
Keep rolling.

23:27.151 --> 23:29.283
Marty! Find his weak spot.
I got to get... get...

23:29.284 --> 23:30.283
Give it to him.

23:30.284 --> 23:31.383
Give it to me.

23:31.384 --> 23:33.050
Turn it off.

23:33.051 --> 23:35.616
Get the fucking camera.

23:35.617 --> 23:36.983
Son of a bitch.

23:36.984 --> 23:39.650
Look into the fucking camera.

23:39.651 --> 23:41.784
Damn it.
Hurry!

23:43.584 --> 23:44.716
Fuck off.

23:44.717 --> 23:46.416
Turn that mother left.

23:46.417 --> 23:48.483
To the left.

23:48.484 --> 23:50.751
Turn that fucking thing off!

24:24.751 --> 24:26.850
Pretty sick, right?

24:26.851 --> 24:27.884
Yeah, amazing.

24:29.784 --> 24:31.384
Can't believe how good
they even are.

24:34.616 --> 24:35.816
You're good enough to do this.

24:35.817 --> 24:37.550
Bullshit.

24:37.551 --> 24:39.616
What's he gonna krump about?
His "bwoken" home?

24:39.617 --> 24:41.983
You get up there, you're
gonna be just another biter.

24:41.984 --> 24:44.016
I'm not a biter.
I have my own moves.

24:44.017 --> 24:46.516
All right.

24:46.517 --> 24:48.150
What do you all think?

24:48.151 --> 24:50.883
Rich little 14-year-old over
here thinks he got the moves.

24:50.884 --> 24:53.116
Biter?
Biter.

24:53.117 --> 24:55.183
I don't see you up there, Lex.

24:55.184 --> 24:56.516
Go fuck yourself, Jazz Hands.

24:56.517 --> 24:58.016
You know what?
I want to go.

24:58.017 --> 25:00.617
What?
I said I'm going.

25:15.284 --> 25:16.616
Hey, Marty.

25:16.617 --> 25:18.617
Hey, Chantelle.

25:21.317 --> 25:22.283
Where's Pop?

25:22.284 --> 25:24.750
Oh, he went to sleep
a little while ago.

25:24.751 --> 25:25.991
Insert age-difference
joke here.

25:27.051 --> 25:28.683
No, I'm good.

25:28.684 --> 25:30.351
I'll... I'll get you later.

25:32.517 --> 25:33.583
You want some?

25:33.584 --> 25:35.551
No.

25:38.051 --> 25:39.083
Are you okay?

25:39.084 --> 25:41.250
Seem a little shook up.

25:41.251 --> 25:42.783
Oh, I won't shrink you,
I promise.

25:42.784 --> 25:44.751
It's just been a rough day.

25:46.717 --> 25:48.850
Well, you should probably know

25:48.851 --> 25:52.183
that Roscoe went out
with Lex tonight.

25:52.184 --> 25:53.950
Fuckin' perfect.

25:53.951 --> 25:55.983
Yeah, I know.

25:55.984 --> 25:58.150
Hey, I'm sorry.

25:58.151 --> 26:01.916
I think your dad's plan is to
let him play it out on his own.

26:01.917 --> 26:03.184
Yeah.

26:07.184 --> 26:08.950
No, no, no, no.

26:08.951 --> 26:10.884
Come here, man.
Come here.

26:14.617 --> 26:18.250
Listen, I don't care what
your grandpa said, all right?

26:18.251 --> 26:20.384
When I tell you
to do something, you...
