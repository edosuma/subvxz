24:22.983 --> 24:24.288
[whooshing]

24:24.332 --> 24:25.942
[Brainy] We've got to
stop those land sharks.

24:25.986 --> 24:29.293
Where's CJ? She can't
tell the world about this.

24:29.337 --> 24:30.730
She must have gone this way.

24:32.732 --> 24:34.995
It's a remote control
for a drone.

24:35.038 --> 24:37.127
That must be how she saw us
in the clearing.

24:37.171 --> 24:39.086
[police siren wailing]

24:39.129 --> 24:40.783
[man over loudspeaker]
Attention, this is the Midvale
Police Department.

24:40.827 --> 24:43.090
Come out of that structure
with your hands up.

24:47.834 --> 24:50.663
Kara. Kara, no. Kara.

24:54.188 --> 24:55.798
Everyone, exit the craft.

24:55.842 --> 24:57.539
Keep your hands
where we can see them.

24:57.583 --> 25:00.063
This is a CJ Grant exclusive.

25:00.107 --> 25:01.935
Kara, what do we do?

25:01.978 --> 25:05.634
Brilliant. Everyone
in the world is going
to know that name. Keera.

25:09.595 --> 25:11.727
My face is numb.

25:11.771 --> 25:14.687
My heart, it's racing.
Feel that. That's not normal.

25:14.730 --> 25:16.166
That is not normal.

25:16.210 --> 25:18.995
We have irrevocably changed
space and time.

25:19.039 --> 25:22.129
-You say that a lot.
-Yes, but this time it's true.

25:22.172 --> 25:25.262
You understand? We released
a horde of savage aliens.

25:25.306 --> 25:27.177
Kara, she's exposed.

25:27.221 --> 25:30.267
Supergirl is lost in
the Phantom Zone,
and we are running out of time.

25:31.791 --> 25:33.140
There's no undoing this one.

25:34.837 --> 25:36.099
But there is, isn't there?

25:38.058 --> 25:40.321
Yes, we can.
Brainy, we have a time machine.

25:40.364 --> 25:43.454
We can fix everything.
We can go back to when
we first landed and start over.

25:43.498 --> 25:45.369
Absolutely not.

25:45.413 --> 25:48.503
Trying to relive
the past two days
would be catastrophic.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.244
There are too many variables.

25:50.287 --> 25:52.159
Landing a millisecond later
than we originally did

25:52.202 --> 25:54.030
would have ramifications
we can never account for.

25:54.074 --> 25:55.858
So what if we don't go back
that far?

25:55.902 --> 25:58.034
What if we only redo
the last couple hours?

25:58.078 --> 25:59.862
My dream was about Cat, right?

25:59.906 --> 26:02.038
So what if we go back to right
before she lets Naxim out?

26:04.084 --> 26:07.174
-But how would be stop her?
-I can stop her.

26:07.217 --> 26:09.568
We can still
salvage this, Brainy.

26:09.611 --> 26:12.701
If we go back to the ship
right now, we can fix
everything. Please.

26:12.745 --> 26:16.705
[officer] Place your hands on
your head where we can
see them. All of you, now.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.580
Get away from my sister! No.

26:21.623 --> 26:22.624
Alex.

26:23.494 --> 26:24.365
Kara.

26:26.280 --> 26:27.890
-Kara.
-Easy.

26:27.934 --> 26:30.197
This jacket is worth more
than your yearly salary.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.939
I'm sorry, you guys,
for everything.

26:34.680 --> 26:35.898
But I'm gonna fix this.

26:46.692 --> 26:48.084
[birds chirping]

26:58.617 --> 26:59.661
[beeping]

27:03.230 --> 27:04.318
Right on time and place.

27:05.754 --> 27:07.930
According to
this energy signature,

27:07.974 --> 27:09.758
Naxim Tork's ship
should be right over there.

27:09.802 --> 27:12.108
So we just have to find CJ
before she finds it.

27:12.152 --> 27:14.676
Honestly, I was dubious
of our plan succeeding...

27:14.720 --> 27:17.810
but, eh, looks like our luck is
finally turning for the better.

27:20.377 --> 27:21.248
Hi, guys.

27:22.771 --> 27:23.946
Don't be mad.

27:28.081 --> 27:29.473
-[Brainy] Okay.
-[Kara sighs]

27:29.517 --> 27:31.301
You stowed away?

27:31.345 --> 27:33.173
I... I heard you say you were
going back in time
to fix things,

27:33.216 --> 27:34.827
so I just...
I followed my instincts and...

27:34.870 --> 27:36.132
Okay, wait.

27:36.176 --> 27:37.090
[sighs]

27:38.831 --> 27:40.397
It was awful.

27:40.441 --> 27:42.791
Under those
police-issued flashlights,

27:42.835 --> 27:47.361
with the reporter
asking me questions and...
and the cops coming in.

27:48.710 --> 27:52.192
In that moment,
I saw my future,

27:52.235 --> 27:54.716
and I'm only 17.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.980
I don't know anything. I...
I don't have a driving permit.

27:58.024 --> 28:00.026
Eliza's only let me do the
laundry once,

28:00.069 --> 28:03.420
and I'm not even sure
I know how to make rice.

28:03.464 --> 28:07.860
I don't know what I want
my future to look like,
but that wasn't it.

28:07.903 --> 28:10.819
So, please,

28:10.863 --> 28:14.214
let me help you
find the reporter
and change things back.

28:16.912 --> 28:18.653
Brainy, you know she's right.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.655
-What?
-That future wasn't hers.

28:20.699 --> 28:23.049
Uh, no. No, no, no.

28:24.703 --> 28:25.704
No super-hearing.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.184
-Brainy.
-No.

28:28.228 --> 28:30.578
-Hey!
-We can't do this, Nia.

28:30.621 --> 28:32.188
What if she runs into herself?

28:32.232 --> 28:34.756
She can't meet Cat Grant.
It's too early.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.324
Well, clearly locking her up
doesn't work.

28:37.367 --> 28:38.368
We'll keep her close.

28:38.891 --> 28:40.283
[whooshing]

28:40.327 --> 28:41.371
[Naxim Tork] I love it,
with the animals...

28:41.415 --> 28:42.851
That's Naxim.

28:42.895 --> 28:44.287
[Nia] Ambushing the old us.

28:45.375 --> 28:47.813
We have to find CJ
and her drone now.

28:49.510 --> 28:51.033
Fine. You can help.

28:51.077 --> 28:53.949
But stay close
and stay out of sight.

28:56.647 --> 28:57.866
[device beeping]

29:03.785 --> 29:04.830
[Kenny] Brandon?

29:06.179 --> 29:07.571
Kara?

29:07.615 --> 29:10.357
CJ's half a mile north. Go.
We'll deal with them.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.968
You want to save your future?
Best thing you can do now
is do nothing.

29:13.012 --> 29:15.275
[chuckling] Hey, Kenny.

29:15.318 --> 29:16.363
Kenny Li.

29:16.406 --> 29:19.061
Alex Danvers.
What are you guys...

29:19.105 --> 29:20.933
What are you guys doing here?

29:20.976 --> 29:23.152
We thought you were in trouble.

29:23.196 --> 29:25.067
-Trouble? I... [scoffs]
-Yeah.

29:25.111 --> 29:26.895
Where... where did Brenda go?

29:26.939 --> 29:28.592
What are you wearing?

29:28.636 --> 29:30.638
What am I wearing?
What are you wearing?
[chuckles]

29:30.681 --> 29:32.814
I'm so sorry, Alex.
I'll tell you everything, okay?

29:32.858 --> 29:34.250
It is a wild story.

29:34.294 --> 29:37.166
It involves alien hunters,
large explosions...

29:37.210 --> 29:39.125
and, well, an excess
of formal wear.

29:39.168 --> 29:41.431
So, at times,
it may seem improbable.

29:41.475 --> 29:42.998
But it's all true.

29:47.089 --> 29:48.351
[drone buzzing]

29:51.877 --> 29:53.226
Gotcha, Ms. Grant.

29:56.490 --> 29:57.621
[drone clanking]

29:57.665 --> 29:58.492
[drone thuds]

29:59.449 --> 30:02.322
No. No, no, no.

30:02.365 --> 30:05.107
I need you to collect
my evidence.

30:05.151 --> 30:08.328
Can't this excuse for a town
do anything for me?

30:09.677 --> 30:10.634
Who are you?

30:10.678 --> 30:12.114
Um...

30:12.158 --> 30:14.421
-Have I seen you before?
-No. But...

30:15.639 --> 30:16.989
but I know you. You're--

30:17.032 --> 30:19.252
If you say Lois Lane,
I will expire.

30:19.295 --> 30:20.731
You're CJ Grant.

30:20.775 --> 30:21.820
How'd you know that?

30:23.169 --> 30:25.258
He sent you, didn't he?

30:25.301 --> 30:27.913
You're one of Perry's weasels
here to drag me back

30:27.956 --> 30:31.046
-to the gossip rag.
-Who's Perry?

30:31.090 --> 30:34.006
My overreaching editor,
Perry White.

30:34.049 --> 30:36.095
PW. Of course.

30:36.138 --> 30:37.357
So, you do work for him?

30:37.400 --> 30:39.272
-No. No, no, no.
-[groaning]

30:39.315 --> 30:42.318
I... I'm just
a journalism major
at a local college.

30:42.362 --> 30:45.321
It's a bit formal for college.

30:45.365 --> 30:47.628
-I'm minoring
in performance art.
-Hmm.

30:47.671 --> 30:51.327
But I have to say,
if this Perry White

30:51.371 --> 30:54.853
wants to keep you
in the gossip column,
he's an idiot.

30:55.375 --> 30:56.637
Oh.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.682
Well, I don't disagree.

30:58.726 --> 31:01.860
You don't need to be
in the woods trying to
prove yourself to Perry White.

31:01.903 --> 31:03.470
You're a visionary,

31:03.513 --> 31:06.429
you're formidable, [chuckling]
you're friends with Oprah.

31:06.473 --> 31:07.474
I am?

31:07.517 --> 31:11.565
Uh, you should be,
in the future.

31:11.608 --> 31:13.697
-Hmm.
-You're a natural-born leader.

31:13.741 --> 31:16.265
You're someone who knows what
she wants and knows
how to get it.

31:16.309 --> 31:18.224
-I am, aren't I?
-Yes.

31:18.267 --> 31:21.096
Yes. You don't need
the Daily Planet.

31:21.140 --> 31:23.533
You have an entire media empire
to build

31:23.577 --> 31:26.928
and an entire generation
of women to inspire.

31:26.972 --> 31:28.930
You're freakin' Cat Grant.

31:28.974 --> 31:30.149
Cat Grant?

31:30.192 --> 31:31.715
-Um...
-Huh.

31:31.759 --> 31:34.066
When I went to work for Perry,
he started calling me CJ,

31:34.109 --> 31:38.331
and I just stuck with it.
But "Cat Grant"...

31:39.288 --> 31:40.594
I like the ring of that

31:41.595 --> 31:42.422
Hmm.

31:44.424 --> 31:45.338
[exhales]

31:49.603 --> 31:51.257
Brenda. Did you find her?

31:51.300 --> 31:52.954
Kara and I put
everything and everyone else

31:52.998 --> 31:55.348
-back to where
they need to be, so--
-She bought it.

31:55.391 --> 31:57.480
-It's time to get out here.
-Wait.

31:57.524 --> 32:00.396
How do we know the future
is really fixed?

32:01.920 --> 32:03.051
[whooshing]

32:08.709 --> 32:11.930
My presets worked.
We're back in 2009 Midvale,

32:11.973 --> 32:14.497
one hour before the meteor
enters the Earth's atmosphere.

32:14.541 --> 32:16.586
-[Nia and Kara chuckle]
-We did it.

32:16.630 --> 32:19.024
My future is mine.
Thank you, guys.

32:20.025 --> 32:21.156
[cell phone ringing]

32:22.592 --> 32:24.812
-Hey, Alex.
-Where are you? I've looked...

32:24.855 --> 32:28.120
-She's freaking out.
I have to go.
-[chuckles]

32:28.163 --> 32:31.732
But Brenda, Brandon...

32:32.863 --> 32:35.431
thank you. Thank you so much.

32:37.477 --> 32:39.261
I'm never gonna forget you.

32:41.872 --> 32:45.615
No. No, I wasn't talking to
anyone. It was just music.

32:45.659 --> 32:47.661
Yeah. I'm on my way.

32:50.229 --> 32:52.318
So, you're sure it worked?

32:52.361 --> 32:54.668
Did we really prevent CJ
from freeing Naxim?

32:56.583 --> 32:57.976
[slow jazz playing]

33:00.021 --> 33:01.066
Mmm.

33:10.684 --> 33:11.685
[cell phone ringing]

33:15.863 --> 33:16.995
Hello.

33:20.346 --> 33:22.696
Perry, let me stop you
right there.

33:22.739 --> 33:26.526
I don't know exactly
what a balloon boy is,

33:26.569 --> 33:29.833
but I do know that I will
not be reporting on one.

33:29.877 --> 33:32.488
I am done reporting on your

33:32.532 --> 33:35.839
shallow, insipid
white-noise bunk.

33:35.883 --> 33:37.319
I did not become a journalist

33:37.363 --> 33:39.539
to write about
which celebrity is in rehab.

33:39.582 --> 33:42.281
I became a journalist
to make waves.

33:42.324 --> 33:44.805
And that is exactly
what I am going to do.

33:45.893 --> 33:47.025
I quit.

33:48.113 --> 33:51.333
Oh, and, Perry, from now on,

33:51.986 --> 33:53.727
it's Cat Grant.

34:00.212 --> 34:01.561
That's one mission down.

34:05.260 --> 34:08.002
Maybe if you bend this way
and I...

34:08.046 --> 34:09.221
Ouch!

34:09.264 --> 34:10.874
-...slide it-- [grunting]
-That's painful.

34:10.918 --> 34:11.788
[beeping]

34:15.227 --> 34:17.098
-Mitch, what did you press?
-Nothing, sir.

34:17.142 --> 34:20.406
But it does sound like
the autopilot's starting up
the engines.

34:22.147 --> 34:24.105
Well, that's not good.

34:24.149 --> 34:27.021
If we launch like this,
things will become
incredibly painful for me.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.066
[both scream]

34:32.113 --> 34:33.723
Two missions down.

34:33.767 --> 34:35.073
[exhales] One more to go.

34:35.899 --> 34:37.075
Any bad dreams?

34:38.859 --> 34:39.729
Not anymore.

34:43.951 --> 34:45.213
[exploding]

34:45.953 --> 34:47.128
Oh, no.

34:51.785 --> 34:52.829
That was close.

34:57.007 --> 34:58.487
Way too close.

34:59.488 --> 35:02.926
Kara. Kara, wake up. Kara!

35:02.970 --> 35:05.146
Inside voice, please.

35:06.539 --> 35:08.062
Kara!

35:08.106 --> 35:09.890
What happened? Are you okay?

35:11.761 --> 35:15.243
-It's just a flesh wound.
-[Alex] This time.

35:15.287 --> 35:16.462
Can you stand?

35:19.247 --> 35:22.468
Okay. Stay here.
I'll get the van and we'll
get you home, okay?

35:25.601 --> 35:27.342
-Huh. [chuckles]
-[Kenny chuckles]

35:27.386 --> 35:28.822
I'm so glad you're okay.

35:31.433 --> 35:34.262
You know,
it's starting to feel like

35:34.306 --> 35:37.831
the universe doesn't want me
to hear whatever it is
you need to tell me.

35:42.836 --> 35:43.663
Kenny...

35:45.360 --> 35:46.579
I love you...

35:47.536 --> 35:50.496
and I love our life here.

35:53.847 --> 35:56.415
But next year...

35:57.938 --> 36:00.854
I can't stay here
and super like we planned.

36:02.551 --> 36:04.466
My mother used to say
that we are

36:04.510 --> 36:07.513
the sum total of all
the choices we make in life.

36:07.556 --> 36:12.648
But... I didn't choose Midvale.

36:12.692 --> 36:15.999
I didn't even choose these
powers. I...

36:16.043 --> 36:20.787
I crashed here by accident
and kind of got locked into
this life.

36:21.266 --> 36:23.181
And...

36:23.224 --> 36:26.184
and I love this life. I do.

36:27.315 --> 36:31.667
But if I stay here
and keep supering,

36:31.711 --> 36:33.582
then I'll just
get locked in again.

36:34.714 --> 36:36.672
And I don't think I want that.

36:36.716 --> 36:40.198
I... I don't even know
if I want to keep supering
all my life,

36:40.241 --> 36:42.330
or stay in Midvale, either.

36:44.376 --> 36:46.552
I think I just need
to make more choices.

36:48.118 --> 36:49.772
I need to figure out who I am.

36:52.688 --> 36:53.559
I...

36:54.908 --> 36:58.433
just got accepted
into National City University,

36:58.477 --> 37:00.783
and I'm choosing to go there.

37:03.786 --> 37:04.744
Come with me?

37:06.702 --> 37:07.703
[Kenny snickers]

37:10.576 --> 37:13.796
Before I met you, Kara,
I was a mess.

37:15.102 --> 37:19.106
My dad had just passed away,
and... and my mom,

37:19.149 --> 37:21.804
she was so depressed that she
couldn't even get out of bed.

37:21.848 --> 37:23.545
So, I'd go to school
in the mornings,

37:23.589 --> 37:28.289
and then I'd run the shop
at night and on the weekends.

37:28.333 --> 37:31.597
And I thought that's how
the rest of my life
was gonna be.

37:33.033 --> 37:34.469
And then you came along.

37:35.949 --> 37:37.429
And you were this...

37:37.472 --> 37:41.041
amazing light
in a world of darkness.

37:42.172 --> 37:45.698
You changed me, Kara Zor-El.

37:45.741 --> 37:47.265
When I'm around you, I'm...

37:48.135 --> 37:49.484
I'm braver.

37:49.528 --> 37:53.445
I'm stronger, I'm...
I'm better.

37:53.488 --> 37:55.751
But after everything that's
happened this past week,

37:55.795 --> 37:57.971
I'm starting to realize that...

37:58.014 --> 38:00.452
maybe I haven't changed
as much as I thought.

38:01.931 --> 38:05.239
And it's great to know
that I could be saved by you.

38:05.283 --> 38:09.330
But I think it's time that I
figure out how to save myself.

38:10.723 --> 38:11.724
So, uh...

38:13.987 --> 38:15.815
no, Kara.

38:16.642 --> 38:17.947
I can't go with you.

38:20.472 --> 38:21.690
[Kara sniffles]

38:26.347 --> 38:27.392
I can...

38:28.523 --> 38:31.221
fly home
on the weekends, right?

38:31.265 --> 38:32.440
[Kenny snickers]

38:34.181 --> 38:35.313
[horn honks]

38:38.664 --> 38:41.319
Stargazing and Monty Python?

38:41.362 --> 38:42.972
Best prom ever.

38:43.016 --> 38:44.322
[both chuckle]

38:52.678 --> 38:54.114
All missions accomplished.

38:58.684 --> 38:59.989
You were great today.

39:03.384 --> 39:05.386
No. Hey, Nia.

39:06.822 --> 39:08.171
You were.

39:08.215 --> 39:12.393
You conjured the dream world
into reality...

39:12.437 --> 39:14.526
and you interpreted your dream
about Cat,

39:14.569 --> 39:16.658
and used that information

39:16.702 --> 39:19.618
to save
the space-time continuum.

39:19.661 --> 39:23.709
I was only able to interpret
my dream because
I've lived through Cat Grant.

39:28.061 --> 39:29.062
You saved us.

39:31.847 --> 39:34.763
And when we save Supergirl
from the Phantom Zone,

39:35.851 --> 39:37.549
it will be because of you.

39:44.077 --> 39:45.121
Brainy, are you crying?

39:46.819 --> 39:47.907
[chuckles and sniffles]

39:47.950 --> 39:48.821
It's just...

39:49.996 --> 39:52.085
[exhales]

39:52.128 --> 39:54.957
I've been so consumed with
negative emotions lately, I...

39:56.611 --> 39:58.396
I forgot how
the good ones felt.

39:58.439 --> 40:02.008
-[chuckles]
-Maybe that's the lesson
of high school.

40:02.051 --> 40:04.793
You're not meant
to suppress the bad emotions,

40:04.837 --> 40:08.406
you're simply meant
to endure them.

40:08.449 --> 40:10.843
So you can appreciate
the good ones when they come.

40:12.148 --> 40:13.019
Mmm.

40:14.412 --> 40:15.587
What are you feeling now?

40:18.416 --> 40:19.591
[beeps and whirrs]

40:20.940 --> 40:21.810
Hopeful.

40:33.692 --> 40:35.737
