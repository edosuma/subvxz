00:45.867 --> 00:49.690
- It was around this
time last night, 11 p.m.,

00:49.690 --> 00:51.023
here on Long Island.

00:52.150 --> 00:55.430
Guess you could say I had a UFO sighting.

00:55.430 --> 00:58.320
I mean, I don't know what the hell it was,

00:58.320 --> 01:01.420
but I'm guessing it was several miles out,

01:01.420 --> 01:03.700
just hovering in the sky,

01:03.700 --> 01:07.853
this orange glowing light,

01:10.660 --> 01:11.960
and before I can pull over,

01:11.960 --> 01:14.100
it darts across the sky,

01:14.100 --> 01:15.083
and it's gone.

01:16.130 --> 01:20.793
No way it was a man-made
craft or drone or whatever.

01:21.900 --> 01:23.493
There wasn't even any sound.

01:24.650 --> 01:28.047
I don't know, I've never
seen anything like it before.

01:32.196 --> 01:35.113
(airplane passing)

01:37.357 --> 01:39.274
Aaah, just an airplane.

02:31.770 --> 02:33.683
Well, at least the moon's out.

02:38.760 --> 02:41.233
1 a.m., still no sign of anything.

02:43.300 --> 02:45.250
Really wishing I had some proof,

02:45.250 --> 02:50.250
but yeah I think it's time to head home,

02:51.237 --> 02:53.430
and I guess I'll just post this online,

02:53.430 --> 02:54.483
see what people say.

03:00.348 --> 03:03.098
(mouse clicking)

03:12.430 --> 03:14.380
This is where I was.

03:14.380 --> 03:17.980
Bendigo Road, if that's
how you pronounce it,

03:17.980 --> 03:21.473
about an hour from my
apartment in Riverhead.

03:23.540 --> 03:25.900
Let's see, believe

03:27.170 --> 03:28.900
I was right about

03:30.810 --> 03:35.653
here when I saw the UFO
off to the northwest,

03:36.950 --> 03:37.783
and,

03:38.800 --> 03:39.750
I checked the news,

03:39.750 --> 03:42.450
nothing about strange lights in the sky,

03:42.450 --> 03:47.150
but I did find there's
been quite a history

03:48.010 --> 03:51.150
of sightings on Long Island.

03:51.150 --> 03:52.030
All right,

03:52.030 --> 03:55.990
each one of these symbols
represents a sighting,

03:55.990 --> 03:58.183
and these are just the most recent ones.

03:59.610 --> 04:01.553
You can see they're all over the place.

04:03.570 --> 04:05.320
Looks like we got one in Riverhead.

04:10.830 --> 04:13.090
Okay,

04:13.090 --> 04:15.733
May 16th, 2016,

04:17.110 --> 04:20.500
circular green object
entering our atmosphere turned

04:20.500 --> 04:22.483
into light storm of energy.

04:24.980 --> 04:26.210
Looks like there's one

04:28.270 --> 04:29.103
out here.

04:29.103 --> 04:29.936
Let's see what that,

04:32.180 --> 04:33.013
okay,

04:33.013 --> 04:33.846
says East,

04:33.846 --> 04:36.453
East Hampton but looks like Montauk.

04:37.640 --> 04:40.433
February 14th, 2016,

04:41.450 --> 04:44.820
bright orange light shines
down into my bathroom window

04:44.820 --> 04:46.283
then disappears.

04:48.360 --> 04:49.193
Hmm.

04:51.930 --> 04:54.483
Should see about getting
my sighting on here.

04:55.740 --> 04:59.020
Found this video on some UFO channel

04:59.020 --> 05:03.943
and this sighting looks almost
exactly like what I saw,

05:06.330 --> 05:07.163
but anyway.

05:10.646 --> 05:13.229
(wind howling)

05:52.530 --> 05:54.840
Same shape and everything,

05:54.840 --> 05:55.763
pretty much,

05:57.830 --> 05:59.520
although mine was more orange

06:00.610 --> 06:02.453
and, of course, it was further away.

06:05.770 --> 06:07.810
It's not every day you
see something like this,

06:07.810 --> 06:08.733
that's for sure.

06:14.020 --> 06:16.463
It's been five days since the sighting.

06:19.660 --> 06:22.210
Just gonna keep posting these videos.

06:22.210 --> 06:27.210
At least I'm getting some
feedback from others who believe,

06:27.330 --> 06:28.563
which is encouraging,

06:30.510 --> 06:33.170
'cause I don't think my family and friends

06:33.170 --> 06:34.530
really believe me,

06:34.530 --> 06:36.133
at least not the ones I've told.

06:38.570 --> 06:39.930
I guess it sounds crazy,

06:39.930 --> 06:44.700
but still, I know what I saw.

06:44.700 --> 06:46.950
No way it was military,

06:46.950 --> 06:49.293
or some kind of natural phenomena.

06:51.630 --> 06:52.900
I mean, there's gotta be other

06:52.900 --> 06:55.390
intelligent life-forms out there,

06:55.390 --> 06:56.970
if not in our solar system,

06:56.970 --> 06:58.373
then some other system,

07:00.210 --> 07:02.763
especially when there's
billions of galaxies,

07:06.920 --> 07:07.800
or maybe these

07:09.210 --> 07:14.060
visitors are from a parallel
universe or alternate dimension

07:18.640 --> 07:19.473
and then,

07:21.170 --> 07:22.870
what the hell are they doing here?

07:25.000 --> 07:26.340
One can only imagine.

07:33.300 --> 07:36.943
So I decided to make my sighting official,

07:39.917 --> 07:41.800
got this form all filled out,

07:41.800 --> 07:43.240
ready to go.

07:43.240 --> 07:45.303
UFO Reporting Headquarters.

07:46.400 --> 07:50.194
Actually there's quite
a number of websites and

07:50.194 --> 07:52.483
organizations that do these,

07:53.720 --> 07:56.683
but anyway,

07:59.400 --> 08:02.300
didn't mark any of these off
'cause none of this happened.

08:03.380 --> 08:04.520
Were there any electrical

08:04.520 --> 08:08.120
or magnetic effects such
as the car engine stopping?

08:08.120 --> 08:09.003
No.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.050
Close encounters?

08:12.050 --> 08:13.033
No.

08:14.820 --> 08:17.360
Was missing time experienced?

08:17.360 --> 08:18.303
No.

08:20.560 --> 08:21.393
Let's see,

08:21.393 --> 08:25.013
this chart was useful.

08:27.560 --> 08:30.873
Didn't realize there was
so many different shapes.

08:33.090 --> 08:37.083
Some of these are really weird.

08:40.080 --> 08:40.913
Anyway,

08:42.040 --> 08:43.733
witness contact information?

08:44.590 --> 08:47.650
Yes, I give permission to release my name.

08:47.650 --> 08:49.960
I mean I'm already public about this so...

08:51.580 --> 08:53.410
Submitting image and video.

08:53.410 --> 08:55.153
Of course I don't have anything,

08:56.480 --> 08:57.800
although they say you can

08:57.800 --> 08:58.883
submit a drawing,

09:00.370 --> 09:02.093
but this will do.

09:03.780 --> 09:04.613
Here we go.

09:11.500 --> 09:12.950
Here at work,

09:12.950 --> 09:14.370
lunch break actually,

09:14.370 --> 09:15.203
and,

09:16.530 --> 09:19.760
really wishing I could just
take the rest of the day off,

09:19.760 --> 09:24.760
but anyway, this guy
messaged me from online,

09:24.820 --> 09:26.720
says he used to live in Long Island

09:26.720 --> 09:28.740
and that all the sightings are linked

09:28.740 --> 09:31.323
to some secret project in Montauk,

09:33.920 --> 09:36.850
but yeah he's agreed to
do a video call tonight,

09:36.850 --> 09:40.190
although he doesn't wanna
reveal his identity,

09:40.190 --> 09:44.070
so I'm not really sure
how that's gonna work, but

09:45.630 --> 09:47.260
I don't know, we'll see what he has to say

09:47.260 --> 09:48.973
and hopefully he's serious.

09:53.980 --> 09:55.420
Hey,

09:55.420 --> 09:57.025
thanks for doing this call.

09:57.025 --> 09:59.657
I'm recording this just so you know.

09:59.657 --> 10:01.550
Yeah, no problem, man.

10:01.550 --> 10:03.440
People gotta hear the truth.

10:03.440 --> 10:05.327
- Nice costume.

10:05.327 --> 10:06.160
-  Costume?

10:06.160 --> 10:09.380
Ha, ha, whatever works, man.

10:09.380 --> 10:11.470
- So what's the deal in Montauk?

10:11.470 --> 10:16.030
I got the link you sent about
the Camp Hero Air Force base,

10:16.030 --> 10:18.837
but it looks like it's just a park.

10:18.837 --> 10:20.270
-  Well, that's what

10:20.270 --> 10:21.510
they want you to think.

10:21.510 --> 10:23.820
I'm surprised you didn't know about it.

10:23.820 --> 10:25.000
- I've only been here a year.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.873
I'm from Connecticut actually.

10:27.756 --> 10:28.589
-  All right,

10:28.589 --> 10:30.200
well here's the deal.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.023
The park is just a cover.

10:33.035 --> 10:36.460
What it really is is an underground base

10:36.460 --> 10:39.720
with, I believe, 12 subterranean levels

10:39.720 --> 10:42.164
and a series of interconnected tunnels.

10:42.164 --> 10:45.200
(coughing)

10:45.200 --> 10:46.307
- You all right?

10:47.773 --> 10:49.440
-  My father told me

10:49.440 --> 10:52.330
that's where the experiments took place.

10:52.330 --> 10:56.070
We're talking psychic warfare,

10:56.070 --> 10:57.770
mind control,

10:57.770 --> 10:59.350
even time travel.

10:59.350 --> 11:00.411
- Time travel, really?

11:00.411 --> 11:01.609
That's--

11:01.609 --> 11:02.860
-  Well yeah.

11:02.860 --> 11:05.483
It's not as far fetched as you think.

11:06.790 --> 11:08.350
Anyway,

11:08.350 --> 11:10.223
they'd mostly take young men,

11:11.350 --> 11:12.538
I mean they'd fucking steal the homeless

11:12.538 --> 11:14.410
right off the streets,

11:14.410 --> 11:16.073
transients, runaways.

11:16.990 --> 11:21.000
Less than 1% of them would
even survive the experiments.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.670
I mean, were talking
at least 10,000 people

11:24.670 --> 11:27.660
and that's just between '71 and '83,

11:27.660 --> 11:30.030
when the project was at its peak,

11:30.030 --> 11:32.740
and I still believe it's going on now.

11:32.740 --> 11:34.163
- The Montauk project?

11:35.064 --> 11:37.090
-  That's right.

11:37.090 --> 11:37.923
- Well how could they could

11:37.923 --> 11:41.030
they be getting away with
this, all those people,

11:41.030 --> 11:42.224
that's insane.

11:42.224 --> 11:43.057
-  The government's

11:43.057 --> 11:44.433
gotten away with worse before.

11:46.040 --> 11:48.123
- And what about the UFO connection then?

11:49.029 --> 11:50.810
Well don't you get it?

11:50.810 --> 11:53.540
They're using alien technology.

11:53.540 --> 11:54.660
- Alien technology,

11:54.660 --> 11:55.677
yep, that's--

11:55.677 --> 11:56.510
-  Yeah,

11:56.510 --> 11:58.735
the ETs are part of the project.

11:58.735 --> 12:00.040
Well, that's why there's so

12:00.040 --> 12:01.493
many sightings in that area.

12:03.120 --> 12:06.770
You see, we're talking about
our own shadow government here,

12:06.770 --> 12:09.860
colluding with Nazi SS scientists.

12:09.860 --> 12:11.233
- So Nazis are--

12:11.233 --> 12:13.690
-  Uh, yeah.

12:13.690 --> 12:16.970
I mean after the second World War,

12:16.970 --> 12:19.000
through Operation Paperclip

12:19.000 --> 12:21.770
they brought these scientists over

12:21.770 --> 12:23.755
and they took their knowledge,

12:23.755 --> 12:26.005
(coughing)

12:27.760 --> 12:31.763
some of which they used in the
Montauk Project years later.

12:33.700 --> 12:36.551
- And your father was a project member?

12:36.551 --> 12:37.384
-  No, no.

12:37.384 --> 12:39.485
He was only stationed there.

12:39.485 --> 12:40.985
God rest his soul.

12:42.637 --> 12:44.600
- What about some kind of evidence,

12:44.600 --> 12:47.940
documents or something

12:47.940 --> 12:50.847
to prove the Montauk Project was real?

12:50.847 --> 12:51.750
-  Oh, it's real,

12:51.750 --> 12:52.583
trust me.

12:53.710 --> 12:56.610
But I doubt there's ever gonna
be any kind of paper trail.

12:57.770 --> 12:58.730
Look, all I know is

12:58.730 --> 13:03.133
what my father told me and
what others have made public.

13:04.020 --> 13:06.679
But I've only scratched the surface.

13:06.679 --> 13:08.210
The rabbit hole goes much deeper

13:08.210 --> 13:10.804
than you could possibly imagine,

13:10.804 --> 13:13.054
(coughing)

13:14.690 --> 13:16.830
but you're gonna need to
do the digging on your own.

13:16.830 --> 13:17.900
- Oh, I plan on it, believe me.

13:17.900 --> 13:20.149
I need to cut this short,

13:20.149 --> 13:22.103
my health ain't what it used to be.

13:23.080 --> 13:23.913
- All right.

13:23.913 --> 13:28.180
Well, keep in touch and
thanks for doing this

13:28.180 --> 13:30.480
and everything and letting me record.

13:30.480 --> 13:31.368
-  Hey,

13:31.368 --> 13:32.285
be careful.

13:35.315 --> 13:38.232
(computer chiming)

13:43.780 --> 13:46.150
- Been reading through this website

13:46.150 --> 13:47.843
which that guy recommended.

13:50.310 --> 13:55.310
Lots of info about the experiments
that supposedly went on,

13:56.250 --> 13:58.443
some background about the project.

14:02.320 --> 14:03.880
Definitely disturbing,

14:03.880 --> 14:04.963
to say the least.

14:07.836 --> 14:09.573
And Montauk of all places.

14:16.150 --> 14:17.030
This is like

14:19.688 --> 14:21.423
Nevada's Area 51,

14:23.660 --> 14:25.243
only more sinister.

14:29.060 --> 14:29.943
I don't know.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.523
Camp Hero State Park.

14:34.860 --> 14:39.453
This at the eastern tip of Long Island,

14:41.530 --> 14:44.053
754 acres.

14:46.170 --> 14:48.983
And this is the military area,

14:51.650 --> 14:54.313
built in 1942.

14:58.300 --> 14:59.133
And

15:02.040 --> 15:03.823
here's the old radar.

15:06.920 --> 15:08.340
Supposedly they were using

15:08.340 --> 15:13.203
this thing as massive transmitter,

15:14.540 --> 15:16.793
which was key to the experiments.

15:19.090 --> 15:19.923
That's

15:20.840 --> 15:22.233
if the stories are true.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.353
It's about midnight,

15:30.450 --> 15:32.563
just had this awful nightmare.

15:34.750 --> 15:37.010
I was at Camp Hero,

15:37.010 --> 15:39.023
standing before that radar.

15:41.010 --> 15:42.550
There was a thunderstorm,

15:42.550 --> 15:43.783
it's night,

15:45.870 --> 15:47.230
and I can see something

15:47.230 --> 15:49.683
standing at the top of that radar tower,

15:52.170 --> 15:53.863
just staring down at me,

15:55.750 --> 15:58.623
like a dark shape or silhouette.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.500
I can't really make out
any of its features,

16:04.500 --> 16:06.603
even in the flashes of lightning,

16:08.380 --> 16:09.843
but I can tell it's humanoid,

16:11.550 --> 16:14.663
although its head seems
too large for its body,

16:16.280 --> 16:18.113
which is almost skeletal,

16:21.640 --> 16:22.893
and it keeps staring.

16:25.726 --> 16:27.963
All I wanna do is run, but I can't.

16:31.270 --> 16:33.290
Then suddenly this tidal wave comes

16:33.290 --> 16:38.290
rising behind the tower out
of nowhere and crashes down.

16:40.940 --> 16:42.553
I'm underwater,

16:43.450 --> 16:44.543
I can't breathe.

16:46.860 --> 16:47.763
Then I woke up.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.173
Seemed so real.

16:57.062 --> 16:57.950
I don't know.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.270
Maybe I'm getting too
obsessed with this stuff.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.260
Been looking through my videos,

17:10.260 --> 17:13.320
and I just wanna thank
everyone that's been

17:13.320 --> 17:14.923
commenting and everything.

17:16.940 --> 17:19.633
It's good to know there's
open minds out there,

17:20.750 --> 17:23.390
especially when people I'm close to

17:23.390 --> 17:25.643
still aren't taking me seriously,

17:28.042 --> 17:30.363
and now they know about
my sighting at work.

17:31.320 --> 17:34.473
Some joker left this on my desk,

17:40.680 --> 17:41.953
but anyway,

17:44.310 --> 17:47.123
I think this weekend I'm
gonna head out to Camp Hero,

17:48.420 --> 17:49.760
go for a cruise.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.240
Get out of town,

17:51.240 --> 17:52.720
maybe stay the whole weekend,

17:52.720 --> 17:56.073
if there's any hotels open.

18:00.290 --> 18:02.590
I don't know what else
I can do at this point.

18:05.080 --> 18:07.603
So I'll leave it at that.

18:13.253 --> 18:17.263
Been driving about 80
minutes now from Riverhead,

18:18.780 --> 18:20.463
Camp Hero should be coming up.

18:22.990 --> 18:24.290
Plan is,

18:24.290 --> 18:25.410
get a bunch of footage,

18:25.410 --> 18:26.827
scope things out.

19:22.354 --> 19:24.752
Let's see, I'm right about here.

19:27.820 --> 19:32.113
These shaded areas are restricted access,

19:34.100 --> 19:35.363
off limits.

19:37.250 --> 19:39.307
Have to see how close I can get.

20:43.790 --> 20:48.010
You know, if the electromagnetic
radiation emitted

20:48.010 --> 20:51.140
from a cell phone can alter our brain

20:51.140 --> 20:54.180
wave activity like some
studies have shown,

20:54.180 --> 20:58.063
imagine what the EM radiation
from that radar could do.

20:59.200 --> 21:02.790
I mean, if it's transmitting
at the right frequencies,

21:02.790 --> 21:05.750
it could definitely alter
our mood and behavior,

21:05.750 --> 21:08.293
making us susceptible to control.

21:10.610 --> 21:12.370
Sounds like science fiction,

21:12.370 --> 21:14.440
but it's actually reality.

22:01.930 --> 22:04.060
This radar was initially key

22:04.060 --> 22:06.560
to the mind control experiments,

22:06.560 --> 22:11.020
but around 1974, they
began using something

22:11.020 --> 22:13.666
called the Montauk Chair which,

22:13.666 --> 22:15.150
from what I read,

22:15.150 --> 22:18.448
was based on alien technology.

22:18.448 --> 22:21.030
Anyway, they hooked this chair device

22:21.030 --> 22:23.600
to the radar system so it could harness

22:23.600 --> 22:28.600
the electromagnetic energy
to amplify psychic powers,

22:29.210 --> 22:32.490
like remote viewing, telepathy,

22:32.490 --> 22:34.702
and there was one psychic

22:34.702 --> 22:37.920
who became the project's most advanced.

22:37.920 --> 22:41.358
Not only was he was able to create objects

22:41.358 --> 22:42.730
out of thin air,

22:42.730 --> 22:47.120
but he could even open
gateways into space and time,

22:47.120 --> 22:48.553
when hooked into the chair,

22:50.680 --> 22:54.953
although, eventually, he
helped sabotage the project.

23:28.317 --> 23:32.067
This is the back of the
maintenance building.

23:46.450 --> 23:48.193
This is one of the bunkers.

23:56.500 --> 23:57.610
Oh, look at that.

23:58.710 --> 23:59.710
Ooh, we got company.

24:34.060 --> 24:35.753
Looks like we got something here.

24:56.200 --> 24:57.033
Yep.

24:57.033 --> 24:58.453
No way I'm getting down there.

25:07.210 --> 25:08.043
What the heck?

25:24.050 --> 25:26.893
Looks like this is the
transmitter building.

26:12.060 --> 26:13.543
Let's see what we can see.

26:25.058 --> 26:28.141
Oh damn it, wish I could get in here.

26:31.711 --> 26:34.044
This is part of Battery 113.

26:48.330 --> 26:49.983
The Montauk Project supposedly came

26:49.983 --> 26:54.980
to an end on August 12th, 1983.

26:54.980 --> 26:57.690
As far as I know, several
key project members,

26:57.690 --> 27:00.550
who were concerned the
experiments were out of control,

27:00.550 --> 27:03.910
had devised a plan to crash the program.

27:03.910 --> 27:06.840
So they had this advanced psychic

27:06.840 --> 27:10.270
guy I talked about create
an invisible creature

27:10.270 --> 27:12.040
from his subconscious mind

27:12.040 --> 27:14.073
when hooked into the Montauk Chair.

27:15.090 --> 27:17.460
They had hoped this would
scare the project heads

27:17.460 --> 27:20.210
into ending all the experiments,

27:20.210 --> 27:23.000
but the plan backfired,

27:23.000 --> 27:26.560
and instead this thing
manifested as a huge,

27:26.560 --> 27:28.830
hairy, beast that went out of control,

27:28.830 --> 27:31.690
destroying everything in its path.

27:31.690 --> 27:34.140
So they rushed to cut the
power to the transmitter

27:34.140 --> 27:36.490
which finally shut everything down,

27:36.490 --> 27:40.033
including this mind-created monster.

27:40.960 --> 27:44.130
Anyway, the base was
soon purged and abandoned

27:44.130 --> 27:45.703
after this disaster.

27:47.240 --> 27:49.348
At least that's how the legend goes.

27:59.060 --> 28:01.260
I've pretty much been
around the whole base.

28:02.550 --> 28:04.700
Doesn't look like much is going on,

28:04.700 --> 28:08.990
but there's definitely a strange vibe.

28:08.990 --> 28:10.153
Not a good feeling.

28:12.640 --> 28:15.890
Anyway, the park closes at sunset

28:15.890 --> 28:19.280
and it's almost eight, so

28:21.300 --> 28:22.250
I'm gonna head out.

28:42.710 --> 28:47.360
Let's see, I'm at some
motel here in Montauk.

28:47.360 --> 28:48.873
Luckily they had a room.

28:50.160 --> 28:53.620
Anyway, the plan is
head out again tomorrow,

28:53.620 --> 28:55.313
get a closer look around,

28:57.650 --> 29:02.273
probably check out this back trail,

29:04.060 --> 29:06.220
which leads to Battery 112

29:08.930 --> 29:12.283
and down by the old Montauk highway.

29:15.610 --> 29:20.610
Definitely gonna need some
cover if I sneak in after dark.

29:23.412 --> 29:25.662
(grunting)

29:30.140 --> 29:33.543
I'm about a mile down from Camp Hero.

29:36.470 --> 29:39.310
Gonna leave my car here
and head to the back trail.

29:39.310 --> 29:42.130
That'll probably be my best way in,

29:42.130 --> 29:44.830
given there's a white
SUV with dark windows

29:44.830 --> 29:47.560
just sitting by the park entrance,

29:47.560 --> 29:49.913
so this place is definitely patrolled.

29:50.820 --> 29:53.320
I mean, the goal is not
to get arrested here.

29:53.320 --> 29:56.620
Haven't done this kind of
shit since I was a kid.

29:56.620 --> 29:58.063
Definitely feeling a rush.

29:59.890 --> 30:01.290
Let's see, tick repellent,

30:01.290 --> 30:03.690
extra batteries,

30:03.690 --> 30:04.523
bolt cutters,

30:04.523 --> 30:05.393
bunch of stuff.

30:06.910 --> 30:08.175
Should be ready to go.

30:48.220 --> 30:50.220
Kind of wishing I brought my cell phone,

30:51.600 --> 30:55.990
but too risky when it could
be used to track my location.

30:57.760 --> 30:59.260
Not taking any chances.

31:11.282 --> 31:12.115
OK.

31:13.612 --> 31:16.445
(car approaching)

31:39.985 --> 31:42.402
Looks like one of those SUVs.

31:43.508 --> 31:44.341
Shit.

32:01.233 --> 32:02.550
I believe I've gone a mile now,

32:02.550 --> 32:04.827
so I don't know where the trail is,

32:04.827 --> 32:06.013
unless I missed it.

32:10.596 --> 32:13.846
I don't know, maybe I should turn back,

32:15.312 --> 32:18.895
but still I got a
feeling about this place.

32:50.132 --> 32:51.751
Here we go,

32:51.751 --> 32:52.584
finally.

34:19.258 --> 34:22.190
This has gotta be Boulder Field,

34:22.190 --> 34:24.833
which means I'm getting
close, according to the map.

34:37.290 --> 34:38.763
Yep, almost there.

34:40.686 --> 34:41.686
Not too far.

35:05.351 --> 35:06.184
11 p.m.

35:06.184 --> 35:08.773
Just felt this strange vibration,

35:09.990 --> 35:12.393
almost like a tremor
coming from the ground.

35:13.590 --> 35:16.263
I'd say it lasted maybe 10 seconds.

35:17.680 --> 35:19.610
Gotta be from an underground facility.

35:19.610 --> 35:21.360
I don't know what else could it be.

36:11.872 --> 36:13.372
Coast looks clear.

37:20.251 --> 37:22.297
Not sure how close I'm gonna get,

37:22.297 --> 37:25.987
given the area by the radar
is under video surveillance,

37:26.906 --> 37:28.893
although I didn't see any
cameras yesterday so--

37:28.893 --> 37:31.882
-  Archer
6, this is Archer X-ray.

37:31.882 --> 37:34.490
Indicate a perimeter breach,
in sector alpha-seven.

37:34.490 --> 37:35.384
-  Shit.

37:35.384 --> 37:36.544
-  Roger, X-ray.

37:36.544 --> 37:38.155
Probably just some more
deer. We'll check it out.

37:38.455 --> 37:39.668
Roger 6 out.

37:39.668 --> 37:43.001
(Jed breathing heavily)

38:44.286 --> 38:47.619
(Jed breathing heavily)

39:09.012 --> 39:12.429
(helicopter approaching)

40:00.229 --> 40:03.562
(Jed breathing heavily)

40:23.450 --> 40:26.783
(Jed breathing heavily)

40:45.487 --> 40:47.456
-  Archer
2, target in sight.

40:47.456 --> 40:50.677
-  Roger 2, intercept
and secure tango.

40:50.677 --> 40:53.677
-  Archer 2 Roger.

41:10.617 --> 41:13.950
(Jed breathing heavily)

41:29.097 --> 41:31.997
(strange humming)
(eerie whirring)

43:00.158 --> 43:02.325
(sighing)

43:21.017 --> 43:22.760
- I'm gonna have to bushwhack outta here

43:22.760 --> 43:27.343
or try to connect to
the old Montauk Highway.

43:29.160 --> 43:30.833
Gotta get back to my car.

43:33.410 --> 43:35.543
Either way, this isn't gonna be easy.

43:44.240 --> 43:47.223
Something is definitely
affecting my compass.

43:50.911 --> 43:51.744
(sighing)

43:51.744 --> 43:53.494
I don't believe this.

44:38.589 --> 44:39.422
My God.

44:54.191 --> 44:55.191
Jesus Christ

45:28.872 --> 45:30.933
Gotta get this footage online,

45:30.933 --> 45:32.183
no matter what.

45:35.094 --> 45:36.594
This shit is real.

45:38.539 --> 45:40.789
All those people, murdered.

45:43.701 --> 45:45.534
It's gotta be stopped,

45:46.635 --> 45:48.135
whatever it takes.

45:49.670 --> 45:51.837
There's no going back now.

46:14.735 --> 46:17.652
Should hit the old Montauk Highway.

46:19.125 --> 46:21.375
(coughing)

46:26.640 --> 46:28.890
(coughing)

46:35.653 --> 46:37.903
(coughing)

46:53.570 --> 46:56.903
(Jed breathing heavily)

47:18.367 --> 47:20.617
(coughing)

47:22.459 --> 47:23.626
Gonna be sick.

47:32.061 --> 47:34.311
(retching)

47:47.969 --> 47:50.219
(coughing)

48:10.236 --> 48:12.486
(coughing)

48:18.704 --> 48:21.537
Must've been exposed to something.

48:22.547 --> 48:24.697
God only knows what
they're doing out here.

48:29.319 --> 48:30.152
Oh man.

48:31.399 --> 48:33.149
I don't look so good.

48:37.356 --> 48:38.439
Not stopping.

48:41.983 --> 48:44.879
(coughing)

48:44.879 --> 48:47.129
(growling)

49:35.734 --> 49:38.992
I don't know what the hell that was.

49:38.992 --> 49:43.152
Definitely felt like
something was watching me,

49:43.152 --> 49:44.819
something unnatural.

49:47.174 --> 49:48.811
I mean,

49:48.811 --> 49:50.038
this place is like,

49:50.038 --> 49:52.288
(coughing)

49:54.174 --> 49:57.089
like one big Twilight Zone.

49:57.089 --> 50:01.973
Like all reality's been
warped or turned on its head.

50:11.452 --> 50:12.285
Come on.

50:17.353 --> 50:19.603
(coughing)

50:36.211 --> 50:37.378
Oh, thank God.

50:57.715 --> 50:59.965
(coughing)

51:16.106 --> 51:16.939
Oh God.

51:19.319 --> 51:21.231
I'm almost there,

51:21.231 --> 51:22.314
almost there.

51:36.604 --> 51:38.854
(coughing)

51:46.567 --> 51:49.900
(Jed breathing heavily)

52:01.338 --> 52:03.588
(coughing)

52:17.518 --> 52:19.435
No, no, no, not my car.

52:26.843 --> 52:30.176
(Jed breathing heavily)

52:43.223 --> 52:44.056
Goddamnit.

52:45.890 --> 52:47.540
I should've listened to that guy.

52:49.173 --> 52:51.253
(sighing)

52:51.253 --> 52:52.886
Shadow government,

52:54.430 --> 52:56.080
alien world order.

52:58.424 --> 53:03.424
(car approaching)
(wind whooshing)

53:07.822 --> 53:10.072
(coughing)

53:22.589 --> 53:27.006
(coughing)
(gasping)

53:47.495 --> 53:50.828
(Jed breathing heavily)

54:02.525 --> 54:04.767
(strange humming)

54:22.975 --> 54:26.016
(eerie whirring)
(strange humming)

54:33.587 --> 54:36.920
(Jed breathing heavily)

55:01.453 --> 55:02.494
Oh my God,

55:04.092 --> 55:05.175
I can see it.

55:07.388 --> 55:08.388
There it is.

55:20.149 --> 55:25.149
(eerie warbling)
(Jed screaming)

56:55.680 --> 56:58.847
(eerie ambient music)
