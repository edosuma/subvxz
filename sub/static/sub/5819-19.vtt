WEBVTT

00:01.176 --> 00:02.614
CAMI: Previously on The Originals...

00:02.644 --> 00:04.996
FREYA: If this prophecy is fulfilled,

00:05.026 --> 00:06.275
you will all fall.

00:06.305 --> 00:07.398
One by friend,

00:07.428 --> 00:08.350
one by foe,

00:08.390 --> 00:10.687
and one by family.

00:10.717 --> 00:11.913
(Grunts)

00:11.943 --> 00:13.980
The Ancestors are doing this to you.

00:14.010 --> 00:15.377
You have to get out of this city,

00:15.407 --> 00:18.156
somewhere where they can't reach you.

00:19.236 --> 00:21.331
(Gasping in pain)

00:21.361 --> 00:23.040
(Panting)

00:23.070 --> 00:24.820
Did Nik ever mention to you what happens

00:24.850 --> 00:26.719
when a vampire goes into a room

00:26.749 --> 00:27.898
without being invited?

00:27.928 --> 00:29.308
(Screaming)

00:29.310 --> 00:31.081
Let her go!

00:32.646 --> 00:34.646
HAYLEY: Aurora's still out cold.

00:34.648 --> 00:36.531
What are the chances
of keeping her that way?

00:36.533 --> 00:38.450
Well, my spell will keep her down.

00:38.452 --> 00:40.624
Covens will never know peace
with the Mikaelsons living here.

00:40.654 --> 00:44.273
Now, my guess is, the Ancestors
see Lucien as a weapon.

00:44.275 --> 00:45.941
This transformed me

00:45.943 --> 00:47.581
into something new.

00:47.611 --> 00:50.279
- My bite is lethal.
- (Screams)

traffic in distance)

01:10.134 --> 01:11.472
Ah.

01:11.502 --> 01:13.919
All the makings of a lovely day.

01:32.723 --> 01:34.173
(Gasps)

01:34.614 --> 01:38.011
Ah, Camille! Finally awake.

01:38.195 --> 01:40.029
Perfect.

01:40.370 --> 01:42.395
You've got a big day ahead of you.

01:43.475 --> 01:44.491
You bit me.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.456
And sampled quite a bit
of your blood, actually.

01:46.486 --> 01:47.824
It was very tasty.

01:47.854 --> 01:50.445
Although more bitter than I expected.

01:52.691 --> 01:54.445
Oh, my God.

01:54.530 --> 01:55.916
I'm gonna die.

01:55.946 --> 01:57.151
Yeah.

01:57.181 --> 01:58.714
Apologies.

01:58.716 --> 02:00.587
But, to be honest,
your days were numbered

02:00.617 --> 02:02.395
the moment you caught Nik's eye.

02:02.425 --> 02:03.599
'Tis ever thus for those

02:03.629 --> 02:05.657
who get close to the bastard.

02:05.727 --> 02:07.123
Myself excluded.

02:07.153 --> 02:09.079
(Whistling)

02:09.109 --> 02:11.744
Ah. Care for tea?

02:16.766 --> 02:18.301
Oh, please, Cami.

02:18.331 --> 02:20.135
Have you not learned?

02:20.337 --> 02:21.552
If you try to fight me,

02:21.582 --> 02:23.772
you will always lose.

02:23.924 --> 02:25.008
(Groans)

02:25.038 --> 02:26.038
(Sighs)

02:26.716 --> 02:27.731
Enough.

02:27.761 --> 02:30.762
If you insist on making
things difficult...

02:30.764 --> 02:31.764
(Grunts)

02:40.719 --> 02:41.719
(Sighs)

02:43.682 --> 02:44.682
(Panting)

02:54.020 --> 02:55.603
CAMI: Klaus?

02:55.605 --> 02:56.603
(Panting)

02:56.761 --> 02:59.097
- Klaus?
- What is it?

02:59.127 --> 03:01.026
Something happened and
you're gonna be angry,

03:01.263 --> 03:02.928
but Lucien wants you to be angry.

03:02.930 --> 03:04.233
He's trying to lure you into a trap.

03:04.263 --> 03:05.219
What did he do?

03:05.249 --> 03:06.532
Promise me you won't

03:06.534 --> 03:09.289
fly off the handle
and do something crazy.

03:09.683 --> 03:11.132
Promise me.

03:17.844 --> 03:20.311
Before you lose it...

03:20.606 --> 03:22.013
Klaus...

03:22.015 --> 03:23.065
look at me.

03:24.323 --> 03:26.468
I love you.

03:26.670 --> 03:29.386
And I won't let you get yourself killed.

03:29.690 --> 03:32.025
- Camille...
- (Gasping)

03:32.055 --> 03:34.676
I just needed you to know.

03:35.075 --> 03:37.129
I can tell you I love you tomorrow.

03:38.284 --> 03:40.725
You're not dying today.

03:46.387 --> 03:50.424
(Buzzing whine)

03:57.837 --> 03:59.411
(Muffled): Cami?

04:00.420 --> 04:01.420
Cami.

04:02.172 --> 04:04.111
(Buzzing whine continues)

04:04.141 --> 04:05.440
Cami...

04:05.442 --> 04:06.942
- (Buzzing stops)
- Hey.

04:07.732 --> 04:09.027
Are you all right?

04:10.442 --> 04:11.980
Yeah.

04:12.382 --> 04:14.048
Considering.

04:16.101 --> 04:17.635
Hold still.

04:20.891 --> 04:22.640
This is going to burn.

04:23.979 --> 04:25.202
(Gasps) Ow.

04:25.248 --> 04:26.545
Ow, what is that?

04:26.547 --> 04:29.152
It's a healing salve. Motherwort.

04:29.182 --> 04:31.149
White willow bark.

04:31.151 --> 04:33.434
The recipe's over 1,000 years old.

04:33.436 --> 04:34.686
So, the good stuff, huh?

04:34.688 --> 04:36.404
Well, it will ease the pain,

04:36.406 --> 04:38.429
dull the symptoms, but...

04:38.459 --> 04:40.509
it won't stop the infection.

04:41.248 --> 04:42.633
So I'm screwed.

04:42.713 --> 04:45.096
We're gonna do everything
that we can, Cami.

04:45.098 --> 04:47.233
ELIJAH: To that end,

04:47.263 --> 04:49.134
a little assistance.

04:49.136 --> 04:50.635
Cami, I'm so sorry.

04:50.637 --> 04:52.270
You should be.

04:52.789 --> 04:54.289
This is your fault.

04:54.291 --> 04:56.312
It was you who turned
Lucien into a beast.

04:56.342 --> 04:57.843
CAMI: Klaus. Stop.

04:57.873 --> 04:59.593
It's not his fault.

04:59.595 --> 05:00.761
HAYLEY: Cami's right.

05:00.763 --> 05:02.213
We all need to work together

05:02.215 --> 05:03.126
to fix this.

05:03.156 --> 05:04.749
KLAUS: Yeah.

05:04.751 --> 05:06.667
Yeah, I think I know how to fix it.

05:06.869 --> 05:09.453
Lucien has always been obsessed with me.

05:09.455 --> 05:11.677
He made himself like me.

05:11.707 --> 05:14.414
My bite is cured by my blood.

05:14.444 --> 05:16.194
Do you think his blood can save her?

05:16.196 --> 05:16.817
ELIJAH: It makes sense.

05:16.847 --> 05:18.180
Lucien would want that power.

05:18.182 --> 05:20.716
Allowing him to lord
himself over his victims.

05:20.718 --> 05:23.051
Okay, so we got a working
theory. Now we gotta test it.

05:23.453 --> 05:25.620
Lucien's blood is all over my apartment.

05:25.622 --> 05:27.756
I sliced him all to hell before I ran.

05:27.758 --> 05:29.457
Okay, I got this one.

05:29.459 --> 05:31.793
Lucien's got no reason to
be on the lookout for me.

05:33.977 --> 05:36.097
Maybe... maybe we hedge our bets.

05:36.099 --> 05:37.515
Hope is a Mikaelson witch

05:37.517 --> 05:38.933
who carries the wolf gene.

05:39.886 --> 05:41.052
We already know

05:41.054 --> 05:42.053
that she has healing power.

05:42.055 --> 05:43.405
It's worth a try.

05:43.435 --> 05:45.890
I'll tell Mary that I'm coming.

05:53.212 --> 05:54.712
(Ship's horn blares)

05:57.437 --> 05:58.770
DAVINA: You just leave?

05:58.772 --> 06:00.855
No good-bye, nothing.

06:00.857 --> 06:02.307
What are you doing here?

06:02.309 --> 06:03.470
I tried to use magic to track you.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.644
Then I realized you were hiding
somewhere magic couldn't reach.

06:05.646 --> 06:06.690
Davina, you should go.

06:06.720 --> 06:08.880
Why would you leave without telling me?

06:09.866 --> 06:11.066
Why would you come back

06:11.068 --> 06:12.273
if you weren't going to tell me?

06:12.303 --> 06:14.374
- Why are you walking away?
- I didn't want to go.

06:14.404 --> 06:16.288
Nor was it my intention to come back.

06:16.290 --> 06:18.657
The Ancestors won't let me leave.

06:19.459 --> 06:20.992
The second I got to the city limits,

06:20.994 --> 06:22.294
I started to desiccate.

06:22.296 --> 06:24.162
I'm cursed, luv.

06:25.632 --> 06:28.333
Those witch spirits have
their hooks deep inside of me.

06:28.335 --> 06:30.502
They allow me no peace,

06:30.504 --> 06:32.387
just a hunger that I can't control.

06:32.389 --> 06:33.838
Look, there's got to be a fix.

06:34.687 --> 06:36.891
Just promise you'll
never leave me again.

06:38.261 --> 06:39.511
(Phone buzzing)

06:40.948 --> 06:42.164
I'm in the middle of something.

06:42.366 --> 06:44.321
Davina, we have a situation.

06:44.351 --> 06:45.984
Lucien went after Cami.

06:45.986 --> 06:46.867
Now, she managed to get away,

06:46.897 --> 06:49.020
but he bit her.

06:49.022 --> 06:50.355
What? Is she...?

06:50.357 --> 06:51.606
MARCEL: No, no, no,
no. She's still alive.

06:51.608 --> 06:53.191
Klaus is with her at the compound.

06:53.193 --> 06:55.007
I'm headed there now.
Let me come get you.

06:55.037 --> 06:55.860
No.

06:55.862 --> 06:57.078
I'll meet you there.

06:57.604 --> 06:59.016
Be careful. All right?

06:59.046 --> 07:00.796
Lucien could be anywhere.

07:19.936 --> 07:20.936
Klaus?

07:21.888 --> 07:23.688
You should be laying down.

07:24.481 --> 07:26.481
You should be getting me soup.

07:26.943 --> 07:29.293
It's the one advantage to being sick.

07:31.198 --> 07:32.697
Or we could just stand here

07:32.699 --> 07:34.315
and stare at your comatose ex.

07:34.517 --> 07:38.507
I was wrong to deny you
the satisfaction of revenge.

07:41.143 --> 07:46.027
I know I'm supposed to
be this big, bad vampire,

07:46.029 --> 07:48.830
but all of the sudden, I'm
not so hung up on "revenge."

07:49.602 --> 07:52.166
Am I angry at what Aurora did to me?

07:53.115 --> 07:54.115
Yeah.

07:54.422 --> 07:56.274
And I've been living in fear
of what else she might do.

07:56.304 --> 08:00.675
But... all of that anger and fear,

08:01.153 --> 08:02.353
that's not me.

08:04.199 --> 08:05.046
I'm the kind of person

08:05.048 --> 08:07.048
that helps people like Aurora.

08:08.381 --> 08:11.181
I'm not gonna let her
take that away from me.

08:13.640 --> 08:14.973
DAVINA: I'm not arguing with you.

08:14.975 --> 08:15.905
If I'm gonna help Cami,

08:15.935 --> 08:17.407
I need to go right to
the source of the problem.

08:17.437 --> 08:20.778
Lucien is an unstoppable
monster made by the Ancestors.

08:20.780 --> 08:22.397
I have stood up to Klaus.

08:22.814 --> 08:25.316
I'm not afraid of some
second-string copycat.

08:25.579 --> 08:27.107
But I can't leave here.

08:27.137 --> 08:28.386
And I am not letting you walk

08:28.388 --> 08:29.921
into a fight by yourself.

08:29.923 --> 08:30.923
Let go.

08:33.413 --> 08:35.510
You can barely control yourself.

08:35.511 --> 08:37.095
Now, if Lucien's working
with the Ancestors,

08:37.097 --> 08:38.563
maybe he can tell me
what they've done to you.

08:38.565 --> 08:40.129
This is madness. You can't fight him!

08:40.159 --> 08:41.705
I don't need to fight him.

08:41.735 --> 08:43.835
I need him to tell me the truth.

08:46.181 --> 08:47.220
And I know a way to do that.

08:47.250 --> 08:49.350
So just stay here, wish me luck.

08:54.114 --> 08:55.747
Davina!

08:56.508 --> 08:57.508
Davina!

09:09.535 --> 09:11.678
This will help slow the
spread of the infection.

09:11.711 --> 09:13.747
In the meantime, you
need to keep her relaxed.

09:13.777 --> 09:15.276
My talents do not lend themselves

09:15.278 --> 09:16.828
to playing nursemaid.

09:17.669 --> 09:19.269
Do you care about her?

09:22.742 --> 09:23.942
Figure it out.

09:28.025 --> 09:29.675
(Distant conversations)

09:41.112 --> 09:43.062
It really is a beautiful day.

09:44.114 --> 09:45.590
Well, perhaps once we've
got all this sorted,

09:45.592 --> 09:47.242
we can go for a stroll.

09:49.829 --> 09:51.295
My sister gave me this concoction.

09:51.297 --> 09:53.719
She assures me it will
put you on the mend.

09:54.029 --> 09:55.029
(Sniffs)

09:55.059 --> 09:58.309
Unfortunately, she's not
quite the mixologist you are.

09:59.814 --> 10:01.305
(Sniffs, groans)

10:01.307 --> 10:02.647
If I am really am dying, there's no way

10:02.677 --> 10:04.677
that's gonna be my last drink.

10:05.052 --> 10:06.502
What can I get you?

10:07.413 --> 10:08.413
Bourbon.

10:08.615 --> 10:10.448
- Neat.
- Neat?

10:10.937 --> 10:12.750
Either you're extremely sophisticated

10:12.752 --> 10:14.685
or you've had one hell of a day.

10:14.872 --> 10:17.122
Need the two be mutually exclusive?

10:19.676 --> 10:21.476
I loved being a bartender.

10:22.382 --> 10:24.545
That endless parade of faces...

10:24.547 --> 10:27.715
Each night, someone new would come in

10:27.717 --> 10:29.667
with a good story.

10:30.235 --> 10:31.435
One guy's shy,

10:32.133 --> 10:33.833
the other won't shut up.

10:34.151 --> 10:35.151
Cheers.

10:42.618 --> 10:44.068
(Places glass down)

10:44.616 --> 10:45.866
I used to think

10:46.852 --> 10:49.191
if you just give someone a little booze,

10:49.221 --> 10:51.021
they'll tell you anything.

10:51.633 --> 10:53.974
Then I realized it wasn't the alcohol.

10:54.228 --> 10:57.060
People just want someone to listen.

10:57.062 --> 10:59.346
Yes, well, you're quite
adept at listening.

10:59.348 --> 11:01.769
In fact, I would so far as to call you

11:01.799 --> 11:03.549
a connoisseur of stories.

11:05.437 --> 11:06.837
Particularly mine.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.607
I should've published your memoir.

11:10.609 --> 11:12.409
I would've made a fortune.

11:13.576 --> 11:15.551
Hey, will you do something for me?

11:15.581 --> 11:18.115
You'd think with current events,
I would've written a will.

11:18.117 --> 11:19.667
But no time like the present.

11:19.669 --> 11:20.718
Will you write a few things down?

11:20.748 --> 11:23.287
- Camille.
- Look,

11:23.289 --> 11:25.289
I've made my peace with dying.

11:25.647 --> 11:26.647
I just...

11:27.375 --> 11:28.793
don't want to leave any loose ends,

11:28.795 --> 11:29.795
so...

11:32.473 --> 11:33.681
Besides...

11:33.683 --> 11:35.383
I was your stenographer.

11:35.833 --> 11:36.883
You owe me.

11:49.739 --> 11:50.789
(Footsteps)

11:51.203 --> 11:52.989
(Sighs) What the hell, man?

11:53.019 --> 11:55.141
Elijah called. Said you'd be here.

11:55.171 --> 11:56.971
I came to watch your back.

11:58.438 --> 11:59.423
How is she?

11:59.425 --> 12:00.975
How you think she is?

12:02.277 --> 12:04.011
She got pulled into a vampire vendetta,

12:04.013 --> 12:06.347
and now if we can't make
this work, she's gonna die,

12:06.349 --> 12:09.216
so she's scared, she's
angry, and right about now,

12:09.218 --> 12:12.553
she's probably wishing that she
never set foot in the Quarter.

12:12.555 --> 12:13.555
(Sighs)

12:18.127 --> 12:19.727
You care about her.

12:19.729 --> 12:20.945
So do I.

12:21.346 --> 12:22.268
And I know you want to help her,

12:22.298 --> 12:23.530
so focus.

12:23.560 --> 12:25.332
Do what you got to do.

12:26.396 --> 12:27.396
Yeah.

12:29.578 --> 12:31.578
(Chanting in ancient language)

12:50.069 --> 12:52.749
- (Gasps)
- Vincent? What's wrong?

12:52.779 --> 12:54.028

12:54.030 --> 12:55.030
Ooh...

12:55.698 --> 12:58.532
The Ancestors are fickle.

12:58.883 --> 13:00.662
They don't want me using
magic, because they know

13:00.692 --> 13:02.018
I sided with vampires.

13:02.048 --> 13:03.048
Come on.

13:44.947 --> 13:46.647
seeking his retribution.

Enough! This is-is pointless.

16:58.932 --> 17:01.384
See, if they help me,

17:01.414 --> 17:03.677
we'd exterminate a certain family

17:03.679 --> 17:05.509
of vermin vampires.

Some loophole to save you

17:35.792 --> 17:37.042
from your doom.

17:38.013 --> 17:39.619
Well, the thing is

17:39.649 --> 17:41.615
I don't believe in loopholes.

vampires near her cabin.

Hope are under my protection.

Unfortunately for Mary,
that didn't do much

18:21.496 --> 18:23.246

Klaus?

22:15.796 --> 22:17.337
A shattering defeat for most men.

22:17.367 --> 22:19.608
But I have since realized

22:19.638 --> 22:20.938
that love simply

22:21.197 --> 22:23.297
makes one weak.

And I can prove it.

22:25.025 --> 22:26.275
When Cami dies,

22:26.305 --> 22:28.807
Nik will be struck by
such overpowering grief,

22:33.147 --> 22:36.615

If you love something, you have
to accept the good with the bad.

23:43.972 --> 23:46.255
I prefer to shape reality to my will.

23:46.257 --> 23:47.757
That's a far better practice

23:47.759 --> 23:49.725
than simply accepting
what's been offered.

23:50.100 --> 23:53.229
Even you don't get to
micromanage the world.

23:53.231 --> 23:56.015
Besides, it's an unhealthy impulse.

23:56.017 --> 23:58.017

Healthy, happy people get by just fine

24:04.776 --> 24:07.076
The whole revenge thing,
the obsession with power...

24:07.078 --> 24:08.277
it's all rooted in fear.

24:08.279 --> 24:09.659
I've been around 1,000 years.

horrors as I've committed.

24:13.386 --> 24:16.786
For one, you're afraid of
what will happen when I'm gone.

24:16.985 --> 24:18.993
I don't want to talk about this.

24:19.023 --> 24:20.517
I'm just trying to enjoy my perfect day.

24:20.547 --> 24:23.747
And I will be able to, if
you allow me make my point.

24:24.534 --> 24:26.734
Do you remember when we first met?

24:27.158 --> 24:28.658
You were so damaged.

24:29.050 --> 24:30.200
Manipulative.

24:30.348 --> 24:31.850
People were just things

24:31.880 --> 24:33.783
that you used to get what you wanted.

24:33.785 --> 24:36.285
(Laughs) That's a harsh appraisal.

24:36.552 --> 24:38.302
Though, I admit accurate.

24:39.250 --> 24:42.300
But you wanted to show me
you were more than that.

24:42.940 --> 24:45.116
So you showed me your whole life.

24:45.492 --> 24:47.285
You wanted to be understood, Klaus.

24:47.315 --> 24:49.170
That's a human impulse, and
if you're capable of that

24:49.200 --> 24:50.533
after everything you've been through,

24:50.535 --> 24:51.656
then you're capable of everything else

24:51.686 --> 24:54.739
that comes with being
human: joy, hope, love.

24:54.769 --> 24:57.440
Do you know that, Klaus?

24:58.206 --> 25:00.393
You are loved.

25:02.614 --> 25:05.109
By Elijah. Rebekah. Freya.

25:05.139 --> 25:07.483
Why are you telling me this?

25:08.967 --> 25:10.787
Because love will make you strong.

25:11.602 --> 25:12.572
It will make you the man

25:12.574 --> 25:15.124
that I know you want to be.

25:15.615 --> 25:17.899
And you're gonna have
to remember that...

25:18.103 --> 25:20.703
because I won't to
be here to remind you.

25:24.996 --> 25:27.003
Hey, hey.

25:27.279 --> 25:28.329

25:30.361 --> 25:31.811
It's gonna be okay.

26:00.151 --> 26:01.401
You lied to me.

26:02.424 --> 26:04.624
I warned you there
would be consequences.

26:04.626 --> 26:07.342
The Ancestors tampered with the
spell I used to bring you back.

26:07.372 --> 26:08.522
We knew that.

26:08.685 --> 26:10.535
But you didn't tell me how.

26:11.349 --> 26:12.754
It was a dark spell to begin with.

26:12.784 --> 26:14.884
They want you to kill me, right?

26:15.091 --> 26:16.452
They want revenge.

26:17.190 --> 26:18.743
Why didn't you say something?

26:18.773 --> 26:20.222
What would you have me say?

26:20.224 --> 26:22.725
"Thank you for saving
me from unending torment,

26:22.727 --> 26:24.777
"I adore you with all my heart.

26:24.779 --> 26:26.729

rip out your throat."

26:30.211 --> 26:32.652

you can't trust me,

29:23.338 --> 29:24.781
I could put her soul in another body...

No. She'd have to agree
for the transfer to hold

38:06.080 --> 38:08.700
This family owes you.

38:08.702 --> 38:11.236
You deserved better.

38:11.238 --> 38:14.156
♪ It's enough of a fight ♪

38:14.158 --> 38:17.910
♪ Staying alive anyway... ♪

38:49.360 --> 38:50.360

39:03.490 --> 39:05.958
What happened to her is on me.

39:08.095 --> 39:10.963
I did the spell that
turned Lucien into...

39:11.710 --> 39:12.965
whatever the hell he is.

39:12.967 --> 39:14.466
And he used my blood.

39:14.682 --> 39:16.885
My family's magic.

39:17.215 --> 39:18.553
Which means

39:18.555 --> 39:19.944
we made him.

39:20.740 --> 39:23.475
And now that we have his blood...

39:23.477 --> 39:27.195
we're gonna find a way to unmake him.

39:32.703 --> 39:35.370
I really wish I could
talk to you right now.

39:48.502 --> 39:49.702
(Wind blowing)

39:59.813 --> 40:00.813
(Rumbling)

40:02.766 --> 40:05.233

40:07.187 --> 40:10.105
(Crowd clamoring in terror)

40:32.212 --> 40:35.130
(Gasping)

40:36.334 --> 40:37.334
Kol?

40:42.890 --> 40:44.022
(Gasps)

40:44.024 --> 40:46.224
(Screams) No, stop!

40:46.226 --> 40:47.893
(Crying)

41:09.640 --> 41:11.750
Davina?

41:19.472 --> 41:21.226
No, no, no...

41:21.228 --> 41:22.228
(Grunting)

41:22.258 --> 41:23.533
Wake up!

41:24.670 --> 41:26.231
Wake up!

41:26.588 --> 41:28.433
Wake up...

41:30.186 --> 41:32.604
Wake up.

41:33.842 --> 41:36.324
(Crying): Wake up...
