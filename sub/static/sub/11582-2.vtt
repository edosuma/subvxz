In the criminal justice system,

00:08.542 --> 00:10.211
sexually based offenses

00:10.244 --> 00:12.180
are considered
especially heinous.

00:12.213 --> 00:13.514
In New York City,

00:13.547 --> 00:15.049
the dedicated detectives

00:15.083 --> 00:16.584
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.617 --> 00:18.152
are members of an elite squad

00:18.186 --> 00:19.720
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.753 --> 00:23.057
These are their stories.

00:23.091 --> 00:25.326
I got six of my own
plus 11 grandkids.

00:25.359 --> 00:26.794
I know
when something's not right.

00:26.827 --> 00:28.596
How long has the baby
been screaming like that?

00:28.629 --> 00:30.364
All day.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.466
My husband's been super
for 30 years.

00:32.500 --> 00:35.169
Always been a nice building.
Good families.

00:35.203 --> 00:36.804
The woman in 2D.
How long she lived here?

00:36.837 --> 00:38.506
Mrs. Wu?
Couple of years.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.708
Always nice and quiet.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.576
Don't speak a lot
of English though.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.747
Mrs. Wu, police.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.317
Everything okay in there?

00:49.350 --> 00:51.419
Someone's moving.
Give me the key.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.621
[baby screaming]

00:53.654 --> 00:55.289
Mrs. Wu!
Hello?

00:55.323 --> 00:57.325
Closet.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.760
[baby screaming]

01:03.597 --> 01:05.099
(Tanner)
No sign of the mother

01:05.133 --> 01:06.334
and the little girl
only speaks Chinese.

01:06.367 --> 01:08.236
Got that covered.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.303
You know their names?

01:09.337 --> 01:10.304
Landlady says
the baby's Suzie.

01:10.338 --> 01:12.140
This is Hannah.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.142
Hannah.

01:14.175 --> 01:16.410
[in Mandarin]
My name is George.
I'm here to help you.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.712
[responding in Mandarin]

01:18.746 --> 01:20.848
Please find my mama.

01:20.881 --> 01:23.284
Honey, is this your mama?

01:23.317 --> 01:24.218
[Huang translates]

01:24.252 --> 01:25.686
(Benson)
Where did your mama go?

01:25.719 --> 01:29.123
[Huang translates]

01:29.157 --> 01:30.824
[Hannah responds in Mandarin]

01:30.858 --> 01:31.792
(Huang)
Mama locked the door

01:31.825 --> 01:34.162
and said
give the baby a bottle

01:34.195 --> 01:36.164
when the hand
points to the red.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.568
Every three hours.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.836
[speaking in Mandarin]

01:42.870 --> 01:44.272
(Huang)
I used up all the milk.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.740
Suzie was crying.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.676
I gave her some crackers,
but she kept crying.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.178
(Benson)
How long has your mama
been gone?

01:52.213 --> 01:54.615
[Huang translates]

01:54.648 --> 01:56.517
[responds in Mandarin]

01:56.550 --> 01:58.219
A really, really long time.

01:58.252 --> 01:59.553
(Stabler)
You know, I'd say

01:59.587 --> 02:01.155
judging from the empty
formula bottles,

02:01.189 --> 02:03.457
that mama's been gone
a week.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.678
Mother's name is Jiao Wu.

02:57.711 --> 02:58.812
Illegal immigrant.

02:58.846 --> 02:59.913
No criminal record.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.349
We checked jails,
hospitals.

03:01.382 --> 03:02.650
No sign of her
in the system.

03:02.683 --> 03:03.984
No husband in the picture.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.686
ACS know the family?

03:05.719 --> 03:07.521
No. And they said
it's gonna take a couple days

03:07.555 --> 03:09.390
to find a Chinese
foster home.

03:09.423 --> 03:10.524
Well, she taught
her six-year-old

03:10.558 --> 03:11.692
how to feed the baby.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.294
Left a supply of formula.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.296
Sounds like she planned
on being gone quite a while.

03:15.329 --> 03:16.497
Probably shackin' up
with a boyfriend.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.898
It's the number one reason
for home alones.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.900
You know, if that landlady
had not called the cops,

03:19.933 --> 03:21.869
those kids coulda died.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.271
They're ready.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.438
(Benson)
Okay, Hannah,

03:24.472 --> 03:25.839
I need you to think
really hard.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.975
Did your mama say
where she was going?

03:28.008 --> 03:32.446
[Huang translates]

03:32.480 --> 03:34.948
[Hannah responds in Mandarin]

03:34.982 --> 03:37.251
To meet a man.

03:37.285 --> 03:38.852
Do you know the man?

03:38.886 --> 03:40.220
[translates]

03:41.789 --> 03:44.858
No. Has her mama
left them alone before?

03:44.892 --> 03:47.461
[translates]

03:47.495 --> 03:51.465
[responds]

03:51.499 --> 03:52.800
Auntie Li Mei
usually watches us.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.034
(Benson)
Does your mom

03:54.067 --> 03:55.336
have other friends?

03:55.369 --> 03:57.371
[Huang translates]

03:59.373 --> 04:01.642
[responds in Mandarin]

04:03.911 --> 04:06.514
Miss Penny.

04:06.547 --> 04:09.016
She works at the market
next door.

04:12.420 --> 04:13.787
(Miss Penny)
Jiao has a sister,

04:13.821 --> 04:14.888
but I never met her.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.023
Do you know where she lives?

04:16.056 --> 04:17.858
She didn't say.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.760
Jiao pretty much kept
to herself.

04:19.793 --> 04:20.994
(Stabler)
Keep her boyfriend
to herself?

04:21.028 --> 04:21.995
(Miss Penny)
Why?

04:22.029 --> 04:24.432
Because she left her two kids
alone for a week.

04:24.465 --> 04:27.034
Jiao would never leave
her kids for him.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.769
Who was he?

04:28.802 --> 04:30.638
Some rich white guy.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.606
Can't blame her
for tryin' to marry for money.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.375
For citizenship.
You ever meet him?

04:34.408 --> 04:36.310
No.

04:36.344 --> 04:38.412
I told her be careful.

04:38.446 --> 04:39.413
Lotta creeps out there

04:39.447 --> 04:40.681
like Asian women.

04:40.714 --> 04:41.982
How did they hook up?

04:42.015 --> 04:44.618
Dating service.

04:44.652 --> 04:45.819
(Stabler)
You got a name?

04:45.853 --> 04:48.889
Golden Happiness.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.324
It's an introduction service
for Asian women.

04:50.358 --> 04:51.525
Totally legal, detectives.

04:51.559 --> 04:53.561
That go for your clients?

04:53.594 --> 04:55.463
Illegal immigrants
have the right to get married.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.498
(Stabler)
Not if it's a scam
to get a green card.

04:57.531 --> 04:58.932
These women don't pay me
a dime.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.868
The white guys do
and they're all citizens.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.370
(Benson)
How much do you charge?

05:02.403 --> 05:03.871
Flat fee.
8,000.

05:03.904 --> 05:06.440
Guaranteed to find you a wife
or your money back.

05:06.474 --> 05:07.741
How closely do you screen
these guys?

05:07.775 --> 05:09.677
I check their credit.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.512
So you could be handing over
vulnerable women to psychopaths.

05:11.545 --> 05:13.381
Not my problem.

05:13.414 --> 05:14.915
If they've got the dough,
I've got the girls.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.950
Who got Jiao Wu?

05:16.984 --> 05:20.788
Pretty girl.
A lot of guys liked her picture.

05:20.821 --> 05:24.324
Let's see.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.428
Lucky winner,

05:27.461 --> 05:29.029
Howard Kendall.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.699
Hot shot Wall Street guy.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.504
(Benson)
Howard Kendall
has one DV assault,

05:36.537 --> 05:39.072
a couple of calls for DWI
plus resisting arrest.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.908
Drunk with a temper, huh?

05:40.941 --> 05:42.810
Maybe he lost it
when he found out

05:42.843 --> 05:44.712
Jiao only wanted him
for his money.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.547
Can I help you?

05:46.580 --> 05:48.849
Yeah, we're looking
for Howard Kendall.

05:48.882 --> 05:50.518
I'm Howie.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.886
You're the mail boy.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.622
Who the hell are you?

05:54.655 --> 05:58.426
Police. Why don't we talk
in your office, Howie?

05:58.459 --> 05:59.693
Yeah, I know Jiao Wu.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.962
We went out a couple times.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.531
Awful fast worker, Howie.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.566
Two, three dates with a woman
who barely speaks English

06:05.599 --> 06:07.167
and we hear
you're getting married.
Not anymore.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.769
We broke up.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.004
(Benson)
Why?
Jiao's a lying bitch.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.606
She told me she was 25.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.807
Then I find out she's 33

06:13.841 --> 06:15.609
with two brats.

06:15.643 --> 06:16.710
I still would've
married her,

06:16.744 --> 06:18.779
but then she dumped me
last week

06:18.812 --> 06:20.781
when I told her
I was a mail clerk.

06:20.814 --> 06:23.050
You sound like an angry guy.
Damn right.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.552
She called the wedding off

06:24.585 --> 06:26.587
and then she welshed
on three grand she owed me.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.088
(Benson)
For what?
Wedding dress.

06:28.121 --> 06:32.125
She said she couldn't return it.
I told her to leave.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.961
You get rough with her?

06:33.994 --> 06:37.064
Maybe I shoved her.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.967
But not so hard
that she had to call you.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.936
No, she didn't.
Jiao's missing.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.205
She's probably out scammin'
some other sucker.

06:45.238 --> 06:49.176
Or maybe you pushed her harder
than you meant to.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.478
No, she was fine.

06:50.511 --> 06:51.779
She called the next day

06:51.812 --> 06:53.581
askin' for this purse
she left at my place.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.182
I told her to come here
and get it

06:55.215 --> 06:56.183
but she never showed.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.686
You still got that purse?

06:58.719 --> 06:59.953
Yeah, it's right here.

07:01.489 --> 07:02.756
Yeah.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.127
That's an Hermes Birkin bag.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.796
It's gotta be $10,000 retail.

07:08.829 --> 07:10.030
(Howie)
Must be fake.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.765
She said she made it
at work.

07:11.799 --> 07:12.966
(Stabler)
Where's that?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.235
I don't know.
Some sweatshop in Chinatown.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.170
The counterfeit squad
can help us with that.

07:17.204 --> 07:18.606
(D'Allesandro)
Leather's good quality

07:18.639 --> 07:20.240
but the machine stitching's
a giveaway.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.543
Hermes bags are hand sown.
It's definitely a fake.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.578
We got a witness that says
the bag was made locally.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.647
Any idea by who?

07:26.680 --> 07:28.582
We used to raid sweatshops
every week

07:28.616 --> 07:30.017
for makin' phony hand bags,

07:30.050 --> 07:31.852
designer jeans,
even T-shirts.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.487
But since 9-11,

07:33.521 --> 07:36.590
we put all our man power
into DVDs.

07:36.624 --> 07:38.592
Bootleg movies pose a threat
to national security?

07:38.626 --> 07:40.227
When Al-Qaeda's
selling them.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.762
Interpol raided
a sleeper cell,

07:41.795 --> 07:43.497
found 20,000 copies
of The Lion King.

07:43.531 --> 07:44.832
Cheap to make.

07:44.865 --> 07:45.866
The profit margin's
higher than drugs

07:45.899 --> 07:47.601
and a helluva lot
less risky.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.202
Using Mickey Mouse to fund
terrorist attacks on America.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.971
What next?

07:51.004 --> 07:52.973
Baby formula, brake pads.
Hell, even double-A batteries.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.975
Best bet
to find a sweatshop

07:55.008 --> 07:56.810
is to track it back
from the retailer.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.646
You got
a Chinatown connection.

07:58.679 --> 08:01.549
Let's start on Canal Street.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.186
Nice bag.
Kate Spade.

08:06.219 --> 08:07.621
Only $40.

08:07.655 --> 08:09.757
Yeah, I'm lookin'
for leather.

08:09.790 --> 08:10.824
We got a nice Coach.
$50.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.660
Everybody has those.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.528
I'm looking
for something really special

08:14.562 --> 08:17.565
like Prada, Ferragamo--
Oh, do you have Hermes?

08:17.598 --> 08:18.899
You got good taste.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.902
How about this?

08:21.935 --> 08:23.070
Take your pick.

08:23.103 --> 08:25.105
I will take this one
right here.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.107
Very nice.
For you, 300.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.277
You got yourself a deal.

08:30.310 --> 08:31.144
All right.

08:31.178 --> 08:32.813
Go.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.181
Police!
Whoa, what's goin' on?

08:34.214 --> 08:37.250
You're under arrest
for trademark infringement.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.787
I didn't know
they were fake.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.989
That's funny since
the real ones cost 10 grand.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.223
Guy gave me
a good discount.

08:43.256 --> 08:45.058
We can get you one
on your prison term

08:45.092 --> 08:46.894
if you tell us
where you got this bag.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.328
They make them
over on Eldridge Street.

08:48.361 --> 08:49.329
(Benson)
Police!

08:49.362 --> 08:50.864
Nobody leaves!

08:50.898 --> 08:52.265
[Policeman translates]

08:52.299 --> 08:54.267
We're not Immigration.
We just need your help.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.103
[Policeman translates]

08:56.136 --> 08:57.738
We're looking
for a woman who works here.

08:57.771 --> 08:58.939
Jiao Wu.

09:01.642 --> 09:04.177
Jiao has not come to work
for a week.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.747
Do you have any idea why?

09:06.780 --> 09:08.916
No, but she's been
very upset.

09:08.949 --> 09:09.883
Said she's been having
problems.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.619
We heard Jiao has a sister.

09:11.652 --> 09:12.886
Do you know her?

09:15.756 --> 09:17.090
Jiao's missing.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.226
We just want to speak
with her sister.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.894
Li Mei Wu.

09:20.928 --> 09:25.766
Works at the laundry
on Pell Street.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.701
That's Li Mei up there.

09:27.735 --> 09:28.936
She speak English?

09:28.969 --> 09:30.337
Always taking classes.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.805
Thank you.

09:31.839 --> 09:32.940
Li Mei Wu.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.975
Yes?

09:35.008 --> 09:37.044
Detective Benson.
This is Detective Stabler.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.046
We'd like to talk to you
about your sister.

09:39.079 --> 09:40.648
Did something happen?

09:40.681 --> 09:42.115
We don't know.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.752
We found Hannah and Suzie
alone in the apartment.

09:44.785 --> 09:46.386
Oh, no.
Are they all right?

09:46.419 --> 09:48.789
Right now
they're in foster care.

09:48.822 --> 09:51.859
How long has Jiao been gone?

09:51.892 --> 09:54.194
(Benson)
We think about a week.

09:54.227 --> 09:58.098
This is all a mistake.
You'll see.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.233
Hannah feeds the baby like
she's had a lot of practice.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.903
Does your sister leave them
alone when she goes to work?

10:02.936 --> 10:04.071
No. No, never.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.405
Jiao takes them
to a baby-sitter,

10:05.438 --> 10:08.208
a woman who works night
at the factory.

10:08.241 --> 10:09.409
She--she loves the girls.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.078
She's a good mother.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.981
When was the last time
you talked to her?

10:14.014 --> 10:15.282
About two weeks ago.

10:15.315 --> 10:16.650
We had a fight.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.285
(Stabler)
About what?

10:18.318 --> 10:20.253
About money.

10:20.287 --> 10:23.023
She wanted to borrow some
and I said no.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.958
You know why
she wanted the money?

10:24.992 --> 10:27.695
For her wedding.

10:27.728 --> 10:28.996
What did Hannah tell you?

10:29.029 --> 10:32.199
Not too much.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.735
Jiao taught Hannah
never to talk to the police.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.236
She's afraid of Immigration.

10:36.269 --> 10:38.105
Please let me see Hannah.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.840
She'll talk to me.

10:41.709 --> 10:43.811
[speaking in Mandarin]

10:47.948 --> 10:50.884
[Mandarin]

10:50.918 --> 10:54.888
She say
she don't know anything.

10:54.922 --> 10:56.389
Can I take the girls home?

10:56.423 --> 10:58.325
There's a family court hearing
the day after tomorrow.

10:58.358 --> 11:01.028
She's lying.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.162
That's not
what Hannah said.

11:02.195 --> 11:03.964
She said mama went to give
the man money

11:03.997 --> 11:07.134
for our big sister.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.704
Jiao has another child?

11:13.473 --> 11:15.142
Her name is Ping.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.711
(Benson)
Where is Ping now?
I don't know.

11:17.745 --> 11:20.147
Don't lie to us again.

11:22.983 --> 11:26.386
Please,
if I say anything else,

11:26.419 --> 11:28.688
they'll be killed.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.430
(Stabler)
Li Mei, you've got
to trust me.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.999
I am afraid.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.333
I understand
that you're afraid.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.235
But I can't help you,
your sister, or her daughter

11:42.269 --> 11:43.470
unless you do trust me.

11:43.503 --> 11:46.139
You've got to tell me
everything.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.141
Now let's start with Ping.

11:48.175 --> 11:51.344
How old is she?

11:51.378 --> 11:54.214
15.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.349
Ping was only a baby

11:56.383 --> 11:59.987
when Jiao and her husband
came here.

12:00.020 --> 12:03.423
They couldn't take her
on the boat.

12:03.456 --> 12:07.094
We saved every penny
to bring her to America.

12:07.127 --> 12:11.398
And then Jiao's husband left
and took all our money.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.033
Where's Ping now?

12:13.066 --> 12:14.201
I don't know.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.468
Come on.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.204
Hannah told you Jiao paid
the man

12:17.237 --> 12:18.839
to bring her over here
from China.

12:18.872 --> 12:21.408
Yes, but I don't know
if Ping is here.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.813
And the wedding money
is for the smugglers, right?

12:25.846 --> 12:30.517
These snakeheads
charge $50,000.

12:30.550 --> 12:35.122
And until you pay off
the debt, they own you.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.858
These snakeheads.
I need names.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.259
I don't know.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.294
Li Mei, these are the people
who have your sister.

12:41.328 --> 12:44.164
Every second you waste
keeps us from finding her.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.867
Please, you must believe me.
I don't know.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.502
I-I begged her not to go.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.504
I told her
that these people kill

12:51.538 --> 12:53.506
if you don't pay them back.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.247
Your sister took a huge risk.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.521
Do you have children,
Mr. Stabler?

13:11.524 --> 13:13.360
Yeah, I've got four.

13:13.393 --> 13:16.229
Then...

13:16.263 --> 13:20.067
wouldn't you deal
with murderers

13:20.100 --> 13:22.502
to get your baby back?

13:27.374 --> 13:30.010
(Benson)
You think the snakeheads
killed Jiao?

13:30.043 --> 13:31.578
She's dead,
she can't repay her debt.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.213
They kill members
of her family first

13:33.246 --> 13:34.547
to intimidate her.

13:34.581 --> 13:36.183
More like they stash Jiao
in some sweatshop

13:36.216 --> 13:37.918
to work off what she owes.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.286
Probably in Chinatown.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.088
But nobody there
talks to outsiders.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.422
Especially the police.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.224
I'll take a few days,
ask around.

13:44.257 --> 13:46.059
It doesn't matter
you know the language.

13:46.093 --> 13:47.294
They'll make you
for a cop.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.962
Have you got a better idea?

13:48.996 --> 13:51.264
Use Li Mei.

13:51.298 --> 13:53.033
You can't send her
out there alone.

13:53.066 --> 13:54.501
(Stabler)
I wasn't planning to.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.136
I'll go with her.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.570
And they won't make you
for a cop.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.406
I'm not going to be doing
any questioning.

13:59.439 --> 14:00.974
She'll do the talking,
I'll play her boyfriend.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.075
I'll do it.

14:04.211 --> 14:05.478
Miss Wu,
that's against our policy.

14:05.512 --> 14:08.348
Agent Wong will be handling
the investigation.

14:08.381 --> 14:09.917
No, they don't know him.

14:09.950 --> 14:12.519
They're not going to tell him
anything.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.554
I can't allow a civilian
to be put at risk.

14:14.587 --> 14:17.257
Fine. Then I go myself.

14:17.290 --> 14:20.093
Jiao is my sister.

14:20.127 --> 14:22.329
She is all I have.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.164
I don't stop
until I find her.

14:26.399 --> 14:29.469
Why don't we grab
a cup of coffee?

14:35.375 --> 14:37.144
(Huang)
Don't do it, Captain.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.512
I'll be with her
every step of the way.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.548
The minute it gets hairy,
I'll yank her out of there.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.583
She'll be safe.
Too dangerous.

14:43.616 --> 14:46.319
You heard Li Mei.
She's going with or without us.

14:46.353 --> 14:49.089
I'm there,
I can protect her.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.926
Background information only.

14:52.960 --> 14:55.362
The first hint of trouble,
I'm shuttin' you down.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.237
(Li Mei)
Mr. Zhang comes
from our village in China

15:04.271 --> 15:06.406
and runs the district
association.

15:06.439 --> 15:09.342
My sister often comes to him
for advice.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.244
[Li Mei greets Zhang
in Cantonese]

15:11.278 --> 15:13.646
Who are you?

15:13.680 --> 15:15.282
I'm with her.

15:15.315 --> 15:19.086
You not come here
to pray.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.121
No, Mr. Zhang.

15:21.154 --> 15:24.591
Just to ask you
for your help.

15:24.624 --> 15:27.360
My sister and I, we had
a stupid fight the other day.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.062
With the company
you're keeping,

15:29.096 --> 15:32.432
I'm not surprised.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.601
I want to say sorry to her,
but she's not home.

15:34.634 --> 15:37.070
Have you seen her?

15:37.104 --> 15:40.073
[responds in Cantonese]

15:44.711 --> 15:46.613
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

15:49.482 --> 15:50.750
So what'd he have to say

15:50.783 --> 15:52.619
after he lectured you for dating
a white guy?

15:52.652 --> 15:53.820
Jiao came to visit him.

15:53.853 --> 15:56.256
Asked whether it was safe to
visit the INS detention center.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.091
Did he say
who she wanted to visit?

15:58.125 --> 16:00.193
No, he didn't know.
But it must've been my niece.

16:00.227 --> 16:02.195
Ping must've been caught
coming in.

16:02.229 --> 16:04.097
Makes sense Jiao would want
to see her daughter

16:04.131 --> 16:05.365
before she got deported.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.167
Maybe they found out
my sister is illegal

16:07.200 --> 16:08.501
and locked her up too.

16:08.535 --> 16:10.137
Li Mei, we checked.
She hasn't been deported.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.671
She's not in jail.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.273
We must go
the detention center.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.142
I'll check it out
after I drop you off.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.376
No, no.
I'm going with you.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.211
Li Mei, listen to me.
You're undocumented.

16:18.245 --> 16:20.713
I can protect you on the streets
but not from the Feds.

16:27.087 --> 16:28.555
(man)
A 15 year old named Ping Wu

16:28.588 --> 16:31.358
was popped at JFK getting off
a flight from Jamaica.

16:31.391 --> 16:32.525
I thought Chinese smugglers

16:32.559 --> 16:34.227
brought their "cargo" in
by container ships.

16:34.261 --> 16:35.495
Not since the Golden Venture

16:35.528 --> 16:37.130
ran aground back in '93.

16:37.164 --> 16:39.066
So how do they
get them here now?

16:39.099 --> 16:40.567
They fly from China to Cuba

16:40.600 --> 16:42.702
then take a boat to some
small Caribbean island.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.337
Then a commercial flight
to the states,

16:44.371 --> 16:46.373
try to blend in
with the tourists.

16:46.406 --> 16:47.774
How did she get caught?

16:47.807 --> 16:49.742
The girl's papers
were really bad fakes.

16:49.776 --> 16:51.178
She get deported?
No.

16:51.211 --> 16:52.545
Straight to detention,

16:52.579 --> 16:53.780
then her attorney filed
an asylum claim.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.682
You still got her
in your lockup?

16:55.715 --> 16:57.217
I'll check.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.686
A pending asylum claim
makes her eligible for bail.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.688
Yeah. Three grand bond
posted last week.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.056
By a Jiao Wu?

17:03.090 --> 17:04.091
That's her mother.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.425
No, by Winnie Chan.

17:07.527 --> 17:08.661
Don't know that name.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.063
Okay, we'll also need

17:10.097 --> 17:11.631
the lawyer's contact
information.

17:13.766 --> 17:18.071
Roger Baker.
Office on Essex Street.

17:18.105 --> 17:19.572
Every detainee
at the Center knows me.

17:19.606 --> 17:21.408
I'm the only guy left
who will do deportation cases

17:21.441 --> 17:22.575
without cash up front.

17:22.609 --> 17:23.610
No good deed
goes unpunished.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.145
What do you mean?

17:25.178 --> 17:27.247
The address that Ping
gave Immigration is phony.

17:27.280 --> 17:28.748
So is the relative
who bailed her out.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.283
Guess I'm not getting paid.

17:30.317 --> 17:31.618
You don't sound surprised.

17:31.651 --> 17:34.187
Unfortunately,
it happens a lot.

17:34.221 --> 17:36.156
Then why do you do it?

17:36.189 --> 17:37.190
This is still
the United States.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.392
All our grandparents
came here from somewhere else.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.194
These people are entitled
to the same chance.

17:41.228 --> 17:42.429
I wish she trusted me.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.431
I think she had a good shot
at asylum.

17:44.464 --> 17:45.665
On what grounds?

17:45.698 --> 17:46.633
She converted
to Christianity,

17:46.666 --> 17:48.568
was being persecuted
for practicing her faith.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.103
That plus her age--

17:50.137 --> 17:51.371
I could've gotten her
a green card.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.140
Ping's mother hire you?
No.

17:53.173 --> 17:54.507
Ping called herself.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.109
My number
gets passed around a lot.

17:56.143 --> 17:58.678
Give us a call if Ping
gets in touch with you, okay?

17:58.711 --> 18:01.080
I will, but she won't.

18:04.217 --> 18:05.718
Did you find Ping?

18:05.752 --> 18:07.587
Your niece got sprung
from the detention center.

18:07.620 --> 18:09.389
Nobody knows
where she went.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.724
Why aren't you looking
for her?

18:11.758 --> 18:13.693
There's nothing more
we can do tonight.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.795
No, no.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.630
First my sister is missing
and now my niece.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.799
You're wasting time.
Listen to me.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.668
Hannah and Suzie are due
in family court

18:21.701 --> 18:23.470
tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM.
You meet us there.

18:23.503 --> 18:24.637
I'll recommend
that the children

18:24.671 --> 18:26.339
are released to you.

18:26.373 --> 18:28.275
And then what?
I'll keep looking.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.543
You take care
of those children.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.448
I will be there tomorrow
at 9:00.

18:41.421 --> 18:42.455
(Stabler)
It's five to 10:00.

18:42.489 --> 18:43.690
Where the hell is Li Mei?

18:43.723 --> 18:45.525
She's--she'll be here.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.194
She wouldn't be this late.
There's something wrong.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.162
All parties
on the matter of the Wu children

18:49.196 --> 18:50.563
step forward.

18:50.597 --> 18:52.599
I want you to go see
if you can find her.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.434
I'll get the case recalled
for this afternoon.

18:57.504 --> 18:58.771
Li Mei was here
last night.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.373
She wasn't scheduled to work,

19:00.407 --> 19:01.841
but she said she needed
some overtime.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.243
When did she leave?

19:03.276 --> 19:05.212
About 5:00 AM.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.879
She had to get dressed
for court.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.781
Make a good impression
on the judge.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.583
She never made it there
and she's not at home.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.485
Well, then I don't know
where she is.

19:12.519 --> 19:14.187
Look, pal, I got two women
missing already.

19:14.221 --> 19:15.788
You don't want
to piss me off today.

19:15.822 --> 19:19.826
I talk to you,
my trucks can have accidents...

19:19.859 --> 19:22.595
my store can burn down.

19:22.629 --> 19:25.232
Bad things could happen to you
if you don't talk to me.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.969
This kid Tommy--
gangster wannabe.

19:30.002 --> 19:32.805
He came in here
to see Li Mei last night.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.874
For what?

19:34.907 --> 19:36.443
Money.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.578
So he was shakin' her down?

19:38.611 --> 19:40.780
You did nothing to help her?

19:40.813 --> 19:42.315
She's an employee.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.916
I got my own family
to worry about.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.852
She leave with him?

19:45.885 --> 19:47.954
Down the back stairs.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.304
[muffled groan]

20:07.607 --> 20:09.208
Oh, my God.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.982
Li Mei.
Li Mei!

20:18.818 --> 20:19.952
Manhattan SVU,

20:19.986 --> 20:22.722
I need a bus Canal and Ludlow
immediately.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.624
Li Mei.
Li Mei.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.559
...on the way.
Come on.
Hang in there.

20:26.593 --> 20:27.960
Hang in there.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.729
It's gonna be all right.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.331
It's gonna be all right.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.270
How is Li Mei?

20:37.304 --> 20:38.938
They beat the hell
out of her.

20:38.971 --> 20:40.407
Nasty cut on her head.

20:40.440 --> 20:42.642
A few broken ribs,
but she'll be all right.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.677
They taught her a lesson.

20:44.711 --> 20:46.513
Next time, she won't be
so lucky.

20:46.546 --> 20:49.382
Detective,
you can see her now.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.284
I'll wait out here.

21:06.733 --> 21:08.735
Li Mei,
who did this to you?

21:10.470 --> 21:11.771
Leave me alone.

21:11.804 --> 21:14.541
Stop. You're in no shape
to move.

21:14.574 --> 21:16.909
I am not talking to you.

21:21.047 --> 21:23.683
Who's Tommy?

21:23.716 --> 21:26.819
Did he want money
or was he trying to scare you?

21:29.856 --> 21:33.560
Li Mei, I know you're afraid.
You've got to talk to me.

21:35.428 --> 21:37.530
My sister is dead.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.900
How do you know that?

21:40.933 --> 21:42.735
The man who beat me...

21:42.769 --> 21:45.405
said they cut her throat.

21:47.540 --> 21:49.709
When Jiao
didn't get her daughter,

21:49.742 --> 21:52.745
they--she told them
that she would go to the police.

21:52.779 --> 21:55.815
And now Jiao's debt
is my debt.

22:10.763 --> 22:11.964
Who beat you up?

22:11.998 --> 22:14.467
Was it the kid
at the laundry?

22:14.501 --> 22:16.636
No, no.
Not Tommy.

22:16.669 --> 22:19.539
Then who?

22:19.572 --> 22:21.408
It was too dark.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.510
I-I-I couldn't see
his face.

22:23.543 --> 22:24.644
Please, please,

22:24.677 --> 22:27.814
just go, just go.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.382
Li Mei...

22:32.051 --> 22:33.920
I'm sorry.

22:37.890 --> 22:40.827
What can I do
so you'll trust me?

22:44.831 --> 22:48.067
Can you protect my nieces?

22:48.100 --> 22:49.969
They'll kill
Hannah and Suzie

22:50.002 --> 22:53.640
if I don't give them
all my savings tomorrow.

22:55.808 --> 22:58.044
I promise you nothing
will happen to them.

23:04.917 --> 23:09.689
When I know they're safe,

23:09.722 --> 23:12.391
I'll do anything you want.

23:18.931 --> 23:20.533
Has anyone been here
to see you?

23:20.567 --> 23:22.735
[Li Mei translates]

23:22.769 --> 23:25.438
[Hannah responds in Mandarin]

23:25.472 --> 23:28.007
A man came when she
was playing outside,

23:28.040 --> 23:30.977
told her to give me
this picture.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.411
It's Ping.
Look how she's dressed.

23:36.182 --> 23:38.485
Snakeheads
are pimpin' her out.

23:38.518 --> 23:39.986
[Hannah speaking Mandarin]

23:40.019 --> 23:44.123
She's asking
about her mother.

23:44.156 --> 23:45.792
Don't-don't tell her
that she's dead

23:45.825 --> 23:47.994
until we know for sure.

23:51.197 --> 23:55.868
[speaking in Mandarin]

24:03.776 --> 24:06.012
You sure they'll be safe?

24:06.045 --> 24:07.847
Cops will be on the girls
'round the clock.

24:07.880 --> 24:10.082
Nobody's getting near them.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.584
Go.

24:14.921 --> 24:16.055
Where are you meeting
the snakeheads?

24:16.088 --> 24:17.790
No, no.
I can't.

24:17.824 --> 24:19.592
We had a deal.

24:19.626 --> 24:20.927
That was before
I saw the picture.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.096
If they find out
I am helping you,

24:24.130 --> 24:26.766
they will kill Ping.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.638
Come on, Li.

24:31.671 --> 24:32.672
Why are we here?

24:32.705 --> 24:34.073
Something you need to see.

24:34.106 --> 24:36.142
Cardillo.
Take all the time
you need.

24:38.177 --> 24:40.146
Who are all these people?
Nobody knows.

24:43.015 --> 24:44.984
These are the dead
we can't identify.

24:49.856 --> 24:50.923
Please, don't make me--

24:50.957 --> 24:52.124
No. Look.
All of them.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.726
Young women exploited,

24:53.760 --> 24:54.961
thrown out like garbage.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.163
Stop it.
Just stop it.

24:57.196 --> 24:58.531
Have you seen enough?

24:58.565 --> 25:00.533
Why are you doing this?

25:00.567 --> 25:02.001
Because the snakeheads
will keep killing girls

25:02.034 --> 25:03.770
until someone stands up.

25:03.803 --> 25:06.573
I can't promise you
we'll find Ping in time,

25:06.606 --> 25:08.074
but the only chance we have

25:08.107 --> 25:12.278
is if you tell me
where that meeting is.

25:12.311 --> 25:15.548
Chinatown.

25:15.582 --> 25:16.983
In a restaurant.

25:18.951 --> 25:21.988
Mobile one.
Street's clear.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.290
(Stabler)
Leader to Ghost one, report.

25:24.323 --> 25:26.893
[whispering]
I'm in.

25:26.926 --> 25:28.861
Ghost two?

25:28.895 --> 25:30.630
Have no sign of her yet.

25:30.663 --> 25:33.065
Hold your positions.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.676
Little sister's on the set.
Stand by.

25:45.845 --> 25:47.279
Got an eyeball on her.

25:58.825 --> 26:00.092
Little sister's in.

26:06.198 --> 26:07.333
It's all there.

26:07.366 --> 26:09.335
Better be.

26:09.368 --> 26:10.937
Sit.

26:10.970 --> 26:13.139
Have some tea.

26:13.172 --> 26:16.008
I'll see you next week.
Same amount.

26:19.646 --> 26:21.147
Subject's on the move.

26:21.180 --> 26:22.982
Red leather jacket.

26:37.797 --> 26:39.065
Red jacket on foot

26:39.098 --> 26:40.366
moving south on Mott.

26:40.399 --> 26:42.168
I got him.

26:57.383 --> 26:59.786
Just turn right
on Elizabeth.

26:59.819 --> 27:01.854
We got the eyeball.

27:11.764 --> 27:13.132
He's going
into the pool hall.

27:35.121 --> 27:37.023
It's all here, man.

27:37.056 --> 27:38.858
Nice and clean.
Very easy.

27:38.891 --> 27:42.729
Red leather jacket
is making the handoff.

27:42.762 --> 27:44.030
Corner table.

27:44.063 --> 27:45.765
This subject
is an Asian male

27:45.798 --> 27:47.166
in a dark blue suit.

27:47.199 --> 27:49.268
We're a go.
I repeat, go.

27:51.337 --> 27:54.006
Police! Put your hands
on the table now!

27:54.040 --> 27:56.342
Put down your cue and put
your hands on the table now.

27:56.375 --> 27:57.343
Who are you?

27:57.376 --> 27:59.311
No.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.983
What's that?

28:06.953 --> 28:09.055
What's your name?

28:09.088 --> 28:12.291
You speak English?

28:12.324 --> 28:13.726
Oh, Ricky Yao.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.762
You're under arrest
for extortion.

28:15.795 --> 28:16.929
Call my lawyer.

28:16.963 --> 28:19.866
Go to my place
and wait for me.

28:19.899 --> 28:21.233
I'll be there soon.

28:21.267 --> 28:22.969
Don't bet on that, pal.
Let's go.

28:27.506 --> 28:29.108
Where's Jiao Wu?

28:29.141 --> 28:30.242
Who's that?

28:30.276 --> 28:32.278
The woman you murdered.

28:32.311 --> 28:34.313
You have the wrong guy.

28:34.346 --> 28:35.915
We've got your errand boy
next door.

28:35.948 --> 28:37.316
First one to talk
gets a deal.

28:37.349 --> 28:39.986
How about the two of us,

28:40.019 --> 28:41.854
candlelight,

28:41.888 --> 28:44.090
bottle of Cristal.

28:44.123 --> 28:46.859
I don't date scum.

28:46.893 --> 28:49.161
Such a beautiful woman
with such a foul mouth.

28:49.195 --> 28:50.529
What a turn on.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.398
Shut up and wait
for your lawyer.

28:52.431 --> 28:55.201
I bet Junior's already
spillin' his guts.

28:55.234 --> 28:56.468
You can't scare me
into talking.

28:56.502 --> 28:57.837
I know my rights.

28:57.870 --> 28:59.105
Tommy, you're a smart kid.

28:59.138 --> 29:00.306
What do you think'll happen

29:00.339 --> 29:03.075
when Ricky Yao finds out
you led us to him?

29:03.109 --> 29:04.510
You're settin' me up
to be killed.

29:04.543 --> 29:06.378
After what you did to Li Mei,

29:06.412 --> 29:08.114
I don't give a crap what Ricky
does to you.

29:09.115 --> 29:10.783
I'm not a rat.

29:10.817 --> 29:12.819
Ricky knows I'll never
betray him.

29:12.852 --> 29:14.787
I'm not worried.
Tommy won't talk.

29:14.821 --> 29:16.956
My partner can be
pretty persuasive.

29:16.989 --> 29:19.091
Can your partner
promise him a future?

29:19.125 --> 29:20.559
Tommy's a bright kid.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.929
He knows I can off him
opportunities.

29:22.962 --> 29:24.496
Like sharing your cell
at Rikers?

29:24.530 --> 29:26.298
Is he gonna be
your punk there too?

29:26.332 --> 29:27.399
I'm not going to jail,
Detective.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.535
You have nothing on me.

29:29.568 --> 29:32.238
Just a coupla counts
of assault and extortion.

29:32.271 --> 29:35.407
Not to mention three open
homicides.

29:35.441 --> 29:38.277
Check my rap sheet.
No charge has ever stuck.

29:38.310 --> 29:39.445
That's because your witnesses
seem to disappear

29:39.478 --> 29:41.447
or get amnesia.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.082
Not this time, Ricky.

29:43.115 --> 29:46.252
That's a promise.

29:46.285 --> 29:47.820
What is it with this
tough guy act?

29:47.854 --> 29:48.921
I know underneath
you're a good kid.

29:48.955 --> 29:51.057
Stop blowin' smoke
up my ass.

29:51.090 --> 29:53.860
All right.

29:53.893 --> 29:56.095
Where were you born?

29:56.128 --> 29:57.096
Here.

29:57.129 --> 29:59.198
Your parents?

29:59.231 --> 30:00.566
They're from Fujian,
little village,

30:00.599 --> 30:01.901
middle of nowhere.

30:01.934 --> 30:04.403
Coming to America,
they took a lot of risks

30:04.436 --> 30:06.038
for a chance at
a better life, huh?

30:06.072 --> 30:07.306
Some life.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.208
My dad was a teacher
in China.

30:09.241 --> 30:11.911
Here he's nothin' but
a delivery man,

30:11.944 --> 30:14.413
ridin' around
on a stupid bicycle,

30:14.446 --> 30:16.348
shovin' menus under doors.

30:16.382 --> 30:18.417
"Beef flied lice,
two dollar."

30:18.450 --> 30:20.452
You ever ask yourself
why he does it?

30:20.486 --> 30:22.388
He tells me all the time.

30:22.421 --> 30:24.857
For me so I can have
a better life.

30:24.891 --> 30:27.493
Well, that's what
I'm tryin' to do.

30:27.526 --> 30:29.862
By workin' for Ricky Yao?

30:29.896 --> 30:31.197
I earn more in a week

30:31.230 --> 30:32.498
than my dad makes in a month.

30:32.531 --> 30:34.200
You shake people down.

30:34.233 --> 30:36.302
I-I pick up the money.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.004
I-I don't hurt anyone.

30:38.037 --> 30:40.039
You muscle working people
like your dad

30:40.072 --> 30:45.077
for their last dimes
and hand it over to Ricky Yao.

30:45.111 --> 30:48.414
You're rippin' off poor folks
to make that dirtbag rich?

30:54.620 --> 30:57.289
Tommy, talk to me.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.962
I can't betray my people.

31:02.995 --> 31:04.630
Ricky Yao's not your people!
Don't ya get it?

31:04.663 --> 31:07.199
He preys on your people!

31:07.233 --> 31:11.103
He beat up Li Mei in that alley.

31:11.137 --> 31:15.975
Be a man.

31:16.008 --> 31:18.610
You stand up for her.

31:30.957 --> 31:34.927
Now, Ricky told Li Mei
her sister was dead.

31:34.961 --> 31:37.496
That true?

31:37.529 --> 31:40.599
Yeah.
You see it happen?

31:40.632 --> 31:42.501
No, I...

31:42.534 --> 31:45.337
Ri--Ric--Ricky called me over...

31:45.371 --> 31:47.006
to his whorehouse
out in Flushing.

31:49.275 --> 31:51.277
He told me to bring
a shovel.

31:55.514 --> 31:57.349
Found the room Ping
was photographed in.

31:57.383 --> 31:59.618
She was here, but the house
has been cleaned out. No girls.

31:59.651 --> 32:02.354
We're checkin' the grounds
right now, I'll let ya know.

32:02.388 --> 32:03.589
Methane probe hit something
that's decomposing

32:03.622 --> 32:05.591
under those trees.

32:05.624 --> 32:08.660
Well, it looks like
we got somethin'.

32:11.197 --> 32:12.464
Dead cat.

32:12.498 --> 32:14.133
Keep searchin'.

32:14.166 --> 32:15.134
You wake up
half the neighborhood

32:15.167 --> 32:19.205
because someone gave Miss Kitty
a proper burial?

32:19.238 --> 32:20.439
Uh, yeah, well...

32:20.472 --> 32:22.508
You notice any guys
workin' out here last week?

32:22.541 --> 32:24.310
Just the moving van.

32:24.343 --> 32:26.578
All those lovely exchange
students went back to China.

32:26.612 --> 32:29.215
Anyone digging?
No.

32:29.248 --> 32:32.484
No. But they did repave
the garage last week.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.726
Hand me the crowbar.

32:45.297 --> 32:47.366
One, two, three.

33:13.059 --> 33:14.726
[sighs]

33:14.760 --> 33:16.262
Jiao Wu.

33:21.800 --> 33:24.803
Yes, this is
my sister.

33:24.836 --> 33:27.106
If you can just
sign the form...

33:27.139 --> 33:29.175
When can I bury her?

33:29.208 --> 33:32.478
As soon as the autopsy's done.

33:32.511 --> 33:33.679
Come on.

33:33.712 --> 33:35.081
I know they killed Ping.

33:35.114 --> 33:36.115
We don't know that.

33:36.148 --> 33:37.383
I know she's dead.

33:37.416 --> 33:39.051
Listen to me,
we're not givin' up.

33:39.085 --> 33:40.419
We're gonna find her.

33:40.452 --> 33:41.687
How?

33:41.720 --> 33:43.422
We got Ricky Yao.

33:45.157 --> 33:46.758
(Novak)
You ready to deal?

33:46.792 --> 33:48.527
(Ricky)
Like I told that hot
lady cop

33:48.560 --> 33:50.096
I have nothin' to say.

33:50.129 --> 33:52.698
Maybe this will change
your mind.

33:52.731 --> 33:54.733
We found Jiao's body buried
underneath your whorehouse

33:54.766 --> 33:56.635
in Flushing.

33:56.668 --> 33:57.636
Check the property rolls.

33:57.669 --> 33:59.705
Mrs. Chan owns that place.

33:59.738 --> 34:01.140
Sweet old lady.

34:01.173 --> 34:03.242
Grandma didn't
slit Jiao's throat.

34:03.275 --> 34:04.243
How do you know?

34:04.276 --> 34:05.644
Do you have any
direct evidence

34:05.677 --> 34:07.779
linking my client
to this murder?

34:07.813 --> 34:09.781
We have enough to arrest him.

34:09.815 --> 34:11.417
Anyone could have
killed that woman.

34:11.450 --> 34:12.518
Especially if the place
was a whorehouse.

34:12.551 --> 34:15.754
(Ricky through speakers)
So many man coming and going.

34:15.787 --> 34:17.323
(Novak)
We'll find witnesses.

34:17.356 --> 34:20.592
Meanwhile, we'll hold you
on the extortion.

34:20.626 --> 34:22.294
And my client will make bail
at arraignment.

34:25.564 --> 34:27.733
By the way, I hear your
detectives are very concerned

34:27.766 --> 34:29.735
about a missing girl.

34:29.768 --> 34:32.571
(Ricky)
Jiao's daughter.

34:32.604 --> 34:35.407
What was her name?

34:35.441 --> 34:37.809
Oh yes, Ping.

34:37.843 --> 34:40.346
Have you found her?

34:44.283 --> 34:46.285
We get the girl...

34:46.318 --> 34:49.355
I'll recommend reduced
sentencing.

34:49.388 --> 34:54.226
Murder two--12 1/2 to 25.

34:54.260 --> 34:55.427
You'll have to do better.

34:55.461 --> 34:58.664
Young girls get lost
so easily.

34:58.697 --> 35:01.467
(Ricky)
I could be very helpful.

35:04.770 --> 35:05.737
No.

35:05.771 --> 35:09.175
Too bad about the kid.

35:09.208 --> 35:14.446
I hear she's a real nice
piece of ass.

35:14.480 --> 35:18.284
Ping's gotta be alive if he's
using her as a bargaining chip.

35:18.317 --> 35:19.618
Or maybe he's playin' us.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.453
I think he's sweatin'
over her.

35:21.487 --> 35:23.589
Maybe she saw Ricky
murder her mother.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.491
Ping was at that brothel.

35:25.524 --> 35:27.326
He can't let her
testify against him.

35:27.359 --> 35:29.328
Second he gets
to Central Booking,

35:29.361 --> 35:31.230
he makes a phone call,
she's dead.

35:33.765 --> 35:35.901
We're done with Ricky Yao,
you can process him.

35:35.934 --> 35:38.737
I can drive him downtown,
give you a little time.

35:38.770 --> 35:40.206
Liv, I can't do anything
in an hour.

35:40.239 --> 35:41.640
Talked to a friend in vice.

35:41.673 --> 35:43.942
Bunch of Chinese hookers
got picked up last night.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.711
Ricky Yao's girls?
Yeah.

35:45.744 --> 35:47.446
Vice shuttered the brothel,

35:47.479 --> 35:49.581
but he's probably got it back up
at another new spot by now.

35:49.615 --> 35:51.817
Are the girls at Rikers?

35:51.850 --> 35:54.953
Immigration.
Waiting to get deported.

35:54.986 --> 35:58.724
Kathy's cousin
works Central Booking.

35:58.757 --> 36:00.359
Mistakes happen.

36:00.392 --> 36:03.229
Or he could get on a bus.
To Attica.

36:03.262 --> 36:04.896
Give us time to talk
to those hookers.

36:04.930 --> 36:07.433
We gotta get to Ping
before he gets to a phone.

36:11.637 --> 36:13.905
When I met Ricky, he said
I was gonna be a waitress.

36:13.939 --> 36:15.874
Stupid me,
I believed him.

36:15.907 --> 36:18.210
How many other girls has
he got working for him?

36:18.244 --> 36:19.645
About a hundred
come through each year.

36:19.678 --> 36:20.746
Where are the brothels?

36:20.779 --> 36:22.781
Ricky owns houses
all over the place.

36:22.814 --> 36:23.749
Queens, plus Chinatown,

36:23.782 --> 36:25.584
some in Brooklyn.

36:25.617 --> 36:28.754
Maybe you can save other girls
from what you went through.

36:28.787 --> 36:29.788
You recognize her?

36:29.821 --> 36:32.324
Name's Ping Wu.

36:32.358 --> 36:34.860
Yeah. Came in with a bunch of
new girls about a week ago,

36:34.893 --> 36:36.562
when we were at the house
out in Flushing.

36:36.595 --> 36:38.430
Well, she wasn't picked up
in the raid last night.

36:38.464 --> 36:39.798
She's very young,

36:39.831 --> 36:42.000
so Ricky probably had her
working at a private party.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.469
We need to find her.

36:43.502 --> 36:45.837
Do you have any idea
where they are now?

36:45.871 --> 36:48.507
I could probably find out

36:48.540 --> 36:50.809
if you can help me
beat this deportation.

36:50.842 --> 36:52.778
If your information is good,

36:52.811 --> 36:53.779
we'll work out a deal.

36:53.812 --> 36:55.714
I want a deal in writing.

36:55.747 --> 36:56.748
Get me a lawyer.

36:58.684 --> 37:01.620
Call Roger Baker, see if he'll
do another pro bono case.

37:01.653 --> 37:04.690
Baker! That's the sonuvabitch
who filed my asylum claim,

37:04.723 --> 37:06.325
and then he sent me
to Ricky Yao.

37:09.328 --> 37:10.696
(Huang)
Thank you for coming
Mr. Baker.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.631
How can I help you?
My cousin was caught
at the airport.

37:12.664 --> 37:14.533
She will be sent back
to China.

37:14.566 --> 37:16.568
They say you are
very good lawyer.

37:16.602 --> 37:18.304
I've had some success.

37:18.337 --> 37:20.272
Please...help her.

37:20.306 --> 37:22.508
First, I need
to take a look at her case.

37:22.541 --> 37:23.509
Okay.

37:23.542 --> 37:26.378
Shing Shing...

37:26.412 --> 37:30.282
Mr. Baker, this is
my cousin Shing Shing.

37:30.316 --> 37:33.952
I could file
asylum papers for her.

37:33.985 --> 37:35.387
But that's expensive.

37:35.421 --> 37:37.856
I cannot pay very much
right now.

37:37.889 --> 37:39.558
Maybe a few hundred dollars.

37:39.591 --> 37:42.294
Your cousin is young?
She, she's a hard worker?

37:42.328 --> 37:44.730
She is.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.398
I think she could make
good money

37:46.432 --> 37:47.799
working for a friend of mine.

37:47.833 --> 37:50.302
The debt would be repaid
in no time.

37:50.336 --> 37:55.541
[speaking Mandarin]

37:55.574 --> 37:58.577
[responds in Mandarin]

37:58.610 --> 38:01.947
She says...
she'll do anything.

38:01.980 --> 38:04.750
Good.
I'll bail her out.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.017
Take her to see this man.

38:07.853 --> 38:09.087
Ricky Yao?

38:09.120 --> 38:11.457
Yeah.

38:11.490 --> 38:14.426
You're not goin' anywhere.

38:16.428 --> 38:17.863
I don't know what that hooker
told you,

38:17.896 --> 38:19.431
but I didn't kill anyone.

38:19.465 --> 38:21.367
Yeah, you're just a saint
with a law degree.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.601
I'm just tryin' to help
these people, okay?

38:22.634 --> 38:24.970
Your big house
in the Hamptons...

38:25.003 --> 38:26.572
Your power boat, the Porsche,

38:26.605 --> 38:28.707
your Chinese clients
help you pay for that?

38:28.740 --> 38:29.975
The market's been good to me.

38:30.008 --> 38:31.443
You're buy your toys
with blood money.

38:31.477 --> 38:33.779
I never hurt anyone.
Okay?

38:33.812 --> 38:35.013
Is that what you tell yourself

38:35.046 --> 38:36.648
so you can sleep at night?

38:36.682 --> 38:38.049
These people are
gonna be deported.

38:38.083 --> 38:40.519
I'm helping them
stay in this country.

38:40.552 --> 38:43.622
By being Ricky Yao's
sex slaves, huh?

38:43.655 --> 38:46.024
To be used up and buried
when he's done with 'em.

38:46.057 --> 38:47.993
You're a pimp
and a murderer.

38:48.026 --> 38:49.761
No. Now listen, listen.

38:49.795 --> 38:53.565
Yao--Yao calls me when people he
smuggles are picked up by INS.

38:53.599 --> 38:55.634
I-I spring 'em
with phony asylum claims

38:55.667 --> 38:58.036
and then he--he fronts the bail
and they go to work.

38:58.069 --> 38:59.705
In his whorehouse.

38:59.738 --> 39:00.739
The--the pretty girls.

39:00.772 --> 39:02.073
The other ones work
straight jobs.

39:02.107 --> 39:04.576
Where's Ping Wu?
Where's Ping Wu!

39:04.610 --> 39:07.546
I thought she was cute.
She would make good money.

39:07.579 --> 39:08.614
I-I sent her to the brothel.

39:08.647 --> 39:09.981
Where did he move her to?

39:10.015 --> 39:11.550
Where'd he move her to?

39:11.583 --> 39:12.718
I...
[chokes]

39:12.751 --> 39:15.421
Mosco--Mosco Street.

39:17.656 --> 39:20.559
Your honor, they put my client
on the bus to Attica.

39:20.592 --> 39:22.961
It appears to have been
a clerical error, your honor.

39:22.994 --> 39:24.896
It better have been,
Miss Novak.

39:24.930 --> 39:26.998
With the court's apology,
Mr. Yao.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.773
In recognition of this
glaring violation of his rights,

39:34.806 --> 39:37.509
I'm releasing the defendant
on his own recognizance.

39:37.543 --> 39:38.777
Thank you.

39:38.810 --> 39:40.111
(judge)
Miss Novak...

39:40.145 --> 39:42.481
Do you plan to present
this case to the Grand Jury?

39:42.514 --> 39:43.949
(Novak)
Yes, your honor.

39:43.982 --> 39:45.984
(counsel)
Then my client asserts his
right to testify

39:46.017 --> 39:48.053
in his own defense
pursuant to 1AD-80.

39:48.086 --> 39:49.421
(judge)
So noted.

39:49.455 --> 39:51.156
I'll see you
back in court on Monday.

39:51.189 --> 39:53.459
Mr. Yao?
You're free to go.

39:53.492 --> 39:54.560
Court is adjourned.

39:54.593 --> 39:55.727
[gavel bangs]

39:56.895 --> 39:58.163
[ladies scream]

39:58.196 --> 39:59.731
Police, nobody move.

39:59.765 --> 40:00.966
Stay right where you are.

40:00.999 --> 40:02.734
Have you seen this girl?

40:06.672 --> 40:07.973
Ping Wu!

40:08.006 --> 40:08.974
[woman screaming]

40:09.007 --> 40:10.576
Okay,
look at this picture.

40:10.609 --> 40:11.877
Have you seen this girl?
Is she here?

40:11.910 --> 40:13.512
Where is she?
Down the hall.

40:13.545 --> 40:14.546
Down the hall.

40:14.580 --> 40:16.081
Officer, get that man
off the phone.

40:17.082 --> 40:18.484
[speaking Mandarin]

40:19.985 --> 40:21.152
Too late!

40:22.688 --> 40:24.189
[woman screams]

40:24.222 --> 40:26.057
We're walkin' out
or she's dead.

40:26.091 --> 40:27.225
Don't hurt her.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.795
(Benson)
Okay, okay, take it easy.

40:29.828 --> 40:30.929
Put the gun down.

40:36.902 --> 40:38.604
Ping, it's okay.

40:38.637 --> 40:40.739
It's okay. We're gonna take you
to your family, okay.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.474
[Huang translating to Mandarin]

40:42.508 --> 40:45.544
(Benson)
Let's get her outta here.

40:45.577 --> 40:47.546
[Huang translating to Mandarin]

41:01.226 --> 41:03.128
Is she okay?
She's fine.

41:03.161 --> 41:04.863
The blood's not hers.

41:04.896 --> 41:07.465
Ping.
[in Mandarin]

41:10.769 --> 41:12.871
You can come with us
to the hospital, okay?

41:12.904 --> 41:14.072
Come on.

41:25.984 --> 41:28.620
Thank you.

41:40.766 --> 41:42.801
Elliot.

41:42.834 --> 41:46.905
Internal Affairs
is waitin' on ya.

41:46.938 --> 41:49.675
And they'll want this.

42:37.789 --> 42:40.025
( wolf howling )
