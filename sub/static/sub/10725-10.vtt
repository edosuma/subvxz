00:37.451 --> 00:39.253
- Yeah.
- That's what I'm talking about.

00:53.435 --> 00:55.404
We had a very good night, Aunt M.

00:55.436 --> 00:56.704
Hmm?

00:56.738 --> 00:58.240
I'd say any night where
I don't have to clean up

00:58.272 --> 01:00.207
your broken bottles is a good night.

01:01.442 --> 01:04.146
Boys, <i>danke.</i> You've
been such a godsend to me

01:04.179 --> 01:05.346
these past few weeks.

01:05.379 --> 01:07.048
No, thank you.

01:07.081 --> 01:09.717
Honestly, hanging out
here has been just cool.

01:09.751 --> 01:11.353
Yeah, I mean, if it weren't for you,

01:11.385 --> 01:13.220
Timothy and I would be stuck somewhere

01:13.254 --> 01:14.656
in the middle of Georgia,

01:14.688 --> 01:16.257
bulldozing dirt for Dad's company.

01:16.290 --> 01:17.625
Not exactly how you'd dream of whiling away

01:17.659 --> 01:19.161
your days between semesters.

01:19.194 --> 01:20.394
I'm going to miss you boys

01:20.427 --> 01:21.997
when you have to go back home for school.

01:22.030 --> 01:23.364
We'll miss you, too.

01:23.397 --> 01:25.533
Ah. <i>Goeie nag,</i> boys.

01:25.566 --> 01:27.401
- Good night.
- Night, Aunt M.

01:27.435 --> 01:30.105
You know, I get why Dad
moved away from Johannesburg

01:30.138 --> 01:31.740
back in the day, but I don't get

01:31.772 --> 01:34.408
why he doesn't like
coming back here to visit.

01:34.441 --> 01:36.310
Who knows? You know how Dad is.

01:36.343 --> 01:37.678
Yeah, you're right.

01:37.712 --> 01:39.381
I'm gonna take the rest of this trash out.

01:39.414 --> 01:41.016
You need me to dump anything else?

01:41.048 --> 01:43.250
Nah, I'm good. I'm gonna head upstairs.

01:43.284 --> 01:44.753
Okay.

01:52.593 --> 01:54.262
Tim, are you okay?

02:01.135 --> 02:02.337
Tim?

02:12.213 --> 02:14.083
Tim!

02:17.218 --> 02:19.655
Hey, quit screwing around!

02:21.255 --> 02:23.691
Hey. Hey, what happened?

02:27.462 --> 02:29.498
Brandon Smit, 22,

02:29.530 --> 02:31.499
a senior at Hallridge University,

02:31.533 --> 02:33.235
and his brother, Timothy, 18,

02:33.267 --> 02:35.669
a freshman at Burlington Crest College.

02:35.702 --> 02:38.140
Both boys hail from Roswell, Georgia.

02:38.172 --> 02:41.342
They were on a break visiting
Johannesburg, South Africa,

02:41.375 --> 02:43.611
where they'd taken temporary jobs in a bar

02:43.644 --> 02:45.780
working for their aunt, Mariam Nell,

02:45.814 --> 02:48.316
who reported them missing 24 hours ago.

02:48.349 --> 02:49.718
<i>Then eight hours ago,</i>

02:49.750 --> 02:52.153
<i>police discovered the
body of Timothy Smit,</i>

02:52.186 --> 02:54.388
<i>mutilated and staged
in an abandoned shanty</i>

02:54.422 --> 02:56.191
<i>just inside the Azaria District,</i>

02:56.224 --> 02:57.492
<i>one of the poorest
neighborhoods in Johannesburg</i>

02:57.524 --> 02:59.694
<i>and 12 miles from their aunt's bar.</i>

02:59.726 --> 03:02.563
Brandon's still missing,
and it would appear

03:02.596 --> 03:05.399
that his murder is consistent with this.

03:05.433 --> 03:07.636
One month ago, Lara Bosch, 29,

03:07.668 --> 03:10.338
was kidnapped from her home in Pretoria,

03:10.370 --> 03:12.606
40 minutes north of Johannesburg.

03:12.640 --> 03:16.445
Her body was later found
like this, also inside Azaria.

03:16.477 --> 03:18.480
You know, the desecration of these bodies,

03:18.512 --> 03:20.248
it's very specific.

03:20.280 --> 03:23.584
Bodies caked in white clay,
spikes driven through foreheads,

03:23.618 --> 03:25.387
tongues severed.

03:25.420 --> 03:26.821
It's derived from

03:26.855 --> 03:28.756
a rare Southern African divining practice,

03:28.790 --> 03:31.192
which is meant to represent <i>umkovu,</i>

03:31.225 --> 03:32.726
which are basically

03:32.760 --> 03:34.563
corpses that have been dug
up and revived by a shaman

03:34.595 --> 03:36.331
in order to do his bidding.

03:36.363 --> 03:38.299
So you think our unsub
believes that he's recruiting

03:38.333 --> 03:39.835
his own zombie soul brigade?

03:39.868 --> 03:43.438
Now given the present status
of Brandon Smit's abduction,

03:43.470 --> 03:45.506
the South African Special Forces Brigade

03:45.540 --> 03:47.275
have taken charge of the mission.

03:47.308 --> 03:49.144
Paramilitary tactics are a
bit of a blunt instrument,

03:49.177 --> 03:50.512
don't you think?

03:50.545 --> 03:51.745
That might be why our ambassador

03:51.779 --> 03:53.548
and the South African foreign minister

03:53.581 --> 03:55.583
have asked us to work with the S.F.B.

03:55.617 --> 03:57.552
Well, time is not on our side.

03:57.584 --> 03:59.521
Brandon's been missing
for over 36 hours now.

03:59.553 --> 04:01.522
I mean, by the book, after 72,

04:01.555 --> 04:04.426
a rescue mission usually
turns into a recovery mission.

04:04.458 --> 04:06.393
Yeah, but if our unsub planned
on killing both brothers,

04:06.427 --> 04:08.196
why wouldn't he have just
done it at the same time

04:08.229 --> 04:10.531
and then arrange their bodies side by side?

04:10.565 --> 04:12.701
Because, for whatever reason,

04:12.733 --> 04:16.303
our unsub's not done with Brandon... yet.

04:16.336 --> 04:18.505
As terrible as that sounds,

04:18.540 --> 04:21.709
it may mean we still have time to save him.

04:38.492 --> 04:39.660
Where's my brother?

04:42.663 --> 04:45.199
Hey! What have you done with him?!

04:50.905 --> 04:54.708
<i>Wena ungufakazi wami.</i>

04:54.742 --> 04:58.580
<i>Wena ungufakazi wami.</i>

04:58.612 --> 05:02.884
What? What do you want?

05:02.917 --> 05:04.553
Please!

05:04.585 --> 05:05.686
No!

A Zulu proverb reminds
us, "Hope does not kill."

05:39.563 --> 05:40.863
Yes, we'll take care of it.

05:40.897 --> 05:42.466
Welcome to you.

05:42.498 --> 05:45.201
I am Brigadier General Yazeen Zwane.

05:45.234 --> 05:47.537
You must be Unit Chief Jack Garrett, eh?

05:47.570 --> 05:48.871
Yes, I am,

05:48.904 --> 05:51.707
and this is my team,
Supervisory Special Agents

05:51.741 --> 05:54.378
Clara Seger, Matt Simmons, and Mae Jarvis.

05:54.411 --> 05:56.547
If you would, follow me, please.

05:56.580 --> 05:58.714
I have been in constant communication

05:58.748 --> 06:01.551
with your ambassador, as
well as our foreign minister,

06:01.585 --> 06:04.854
and I assure you of the utmost cooperation

06:04.887 --> 06:06.789
- with this mission.
- I appreciate that, General.

06:06.823 --> 06:08.524
However, we are concerned

06:08.558 --> 06:11.395
about the application of
counterinsurgency tactics

06:11.428 --> 06:13.697
- in this investigation.
- I understand.

06:13.729 --> 06:17.533
I suppose it seemed like, uh,
using a cannon to swat a fly.

06:17.566 --> 06:19.502
Obviously, we'd feel more comfortable

06:19.536 --> 06:20.437
coordinating this mission

06:20.471 --> 06:22.673
based on a comprehensive criminal profile.

06:22.705 --> 06:25.308
We really need to get to
work on that immediately.

06:25.342 --> 06:27.544
- Brandon's life depends on it.
- I could not agree with you more.

06:27.577 --> 06:30.547
That is why we've called in
our country's premier profiler

06:30.580 --> 06:32.515
to assist you...

06:32.549 --> 06:35.818
Lieutenant Ananda Doshi.

06:35.851 --> 06:39.623
I am sorry. Will there
be a problem with that?

06:39.656 --> 06:42.793
No. No problem.

06:42.825 --> 06:44.660
But I'll wanna walk
through the body dump site

06:44.693 --> 06:46.597
with Agent Seger,

06:46.630 --> 06:49.332
and have Agent Simmons here
inspect the abduction site

06:49.366 --> 06:52.483
while Agent Jarvis assists
with Timothy Smit's autopsy.

06:52.694 --> 06:53.301
Certainly.

06:53.303 --> 06:54.671
I will arrange for your escort

06:54.703 --> 06:56.906
and for Lieutenant Doshi to meet you

06:56.940 --> 06:58.541
at the Azaria scene.

06:58.575 --> 07:00.277
You sure you're gonna be okay

07:00.310 --> 07:02.412
- working with her again?
- I'm sure.

07:02.445 --> 07:03.413
Is this the same Ananda Doshi

07:03.445 --> 07:05.715
that's responsible for
catching Gabriel Imani,

07:05.748 --> 07:07.818
a.k.a. "The Archangel," in Madagascar?

07:07.851 --> 07:09.386
Didn't you work that case, Boss?

07:09.419 --> 07:11.654
Yeah, which is why I'm bringing it up.

07:11.688 --> 07:13.690
Look, if they want her, we got her.

07:13.722 --> 07:15.458
We have a job to do.

07:16.726 --> 07:20.264
Why did I allow my sons to go?

07:20.296 --> 07:23.032
I insisted you let them, Armand.

07:23.065 --> 07:25.868
It's not like they
hadn't been there before.

07:25.902 --> 07:28.671
They missed your sister.

07:28.705 --> 07:31.608
Then she should have come to visit us.

07:31.640 --> 07:34.477
I'll still never understand
why she chose to stay

07:34.510 --> 07:36.912
in that godforsaken place after I left.

07:36.945 --> 07:39.749
Mr. and Mrs. Smit, I know
this a difficult time for you,

07:39.782 --> 07:41.951
but you cannot blame yourselves

07:41.984 --> 07:43.854
for what happened to Timothy and Brandon.

07:43.887 --> 07:45.756
I wish I could believe you,

07:45.789 --> 07:47.758
but a man's sole responsibility

07:47.791 --> 07:49.793
is to protect the ones he loves.

07:49.825 --> 07:52.729
That's why I left South
Africa 25 years ago.

07:52.762 --> 07:54.064
I met my wife.

07:54.097 --> 07:56.933
I wanted to start a
family in a better place.

07:56.965 --> 08:00.037
I understand, Sir. I'm... I'm sorry.

08:00.070 --> 08:01.837
I just have a couple more questions.

08:01.871 --> 08:03.472
Given the neighborhood,

08:03.505 --> 08:04.974
did the boys ever mention

08:05.008 --> 08:07.777
being hassled by any of the local gangs?

08:07.811 --> 08:09.779
No. Why?

08:09.813 --> 08:11.414
Nothing specific.

08:11.448 --> 08:14.418
We just have to evaluate
every possible threat.

08:14.450 --> 08:17.786
Now, Mr. Smit, you immigrated
from South Africa in 1990

08:17.820 --> 08:19.989
and then became a U.S. citizen in 2004?

08:20.022 --> 08:21.657
That's correct.

08:21.690 --> 08:24.428
And your only other living
relative in South Africa

08:24.460 --> 08:25.795
is your sister, Mariam Nell?

08:25.828 --> 08:28.664
- Is that right?
- Yes.

08:28.697 --> 08:30.833
The boys just adored Mariam.

08:30.867 --> 08:34.570
She and I were the ones who
made the arrangements for them

08:34.604 --> 08:36.907
to stay and work down
there for a few weeks.

08:36.940 --> 08:39.075
The only security camera the police found

08:39.109 --> 08:41.912
was situated over this bar
pointing at the cash register.

08:41.945 --> 08:45.782
Yeah. The only one I thought I needed.

08:45.815 --> 08:48.685
That, and the <i>geweer</i> behind the bar.

08:48.718 --> 08:49.853
Sorry. The... the what?

08:49.886 --> 08:52.389
I bought a gun. A.38.

08:52.421 --> 08:55.725
Right, but no gun was... was found.

08:55.758 --> 08:58.794
It wasn't any help at all, was it?

08:58.828 --> 09:00.797
I just never should have left them.

09:00.830 --> 09:04.066
Ms. Nell, did you or the
boys ever receive any threats?

09:04.099 --> 09:06.069
<i>Ja.</i>

09:06.102 --> 09:09.539
A couple of Ibhuloho came
around a few months back.

09:09.571 --> 09:11.541
They wanted me to start
paying them protection money,

09:11.574 --> 09:14.710
but I refused to pay them.

09:14.743 --> 09:16.680
You think they did this to my nephews?

09:16.713 --> 09:18.515
Do you think you could identify these men?

09:18.547 --> 09:19.682
<i>Ja,</i> I might.

09:19.715 --> 09:23.018
Uh, just one last thing.

09:23.051 --> 09:25.522
- You recognize this woman?
- No.

09:25.555 --> 09:27.858
Her name is Lara Bosch.

09:27.891 --> 09:29.459
Bosch?

09:29.492 --> 09:32.462
Yes. Does that ring a bell?

09:32.494 --> 09:35.532
No, I'm sorry.

09:37.200 --> 09:40.469
You think she's involved somehow?

09:40.503 --> 09:44.040
She's another victim, Ma'am.

10:01.523 --> 10:02.825
Yeah, I've heard Doshi's methodology

10:02.859 --> 10:04.728
can be a little unorthodox,

10:04.761 --> 10:05.796
but you never told me what
happened between the two of you.

10:05.829 --> 10:07.664
What caused the falling out?

10:07.696 --> 10:09.666
I'm not sure this is the time.

10:09.699 --> 10:12.868
I'm not sure it's fair to have
me go in there flying blind.

10:12.902 --> 10:14.503
Doshi may have been
trained by Scotland Yard

10:14.537 --> 10:15.806
in forensic psychology,

10:15.839 --> 10:18.775
but she doesn't really
see herself as a profiler.

10:18.807 --> 10:21.177
Then how does she see herself?

10:21.210 --> 10:23.846
<i>Ungesabi.</i>

10:23.879 --> 10:25.881
<i>Ngizwe.</i>

10:25.915 --> 10:28.752
<i>Wena akudingeki wesabe.</i>

10:28.785 --> 10:33.457
Timothy, speak, if you will.

10:37.960 --> 10:39.762
It's been too long, Jack.

10:39.796 --> 10:41.031
I'm told you now run

10:41.064 --> 10:43.900
your own personal division of the FBI.

10:43.932 --> 10:45.768
It's not my personal division.

10:45.801 --> 10:48.471
It's the Bureau's
International Response Team.

10:48.504 --> 10:49.839
I'm the unit chief.

10:49.873 --> 10:52.075
And this is S.S.A. Clara Seger.

10:52.108 --> 10:54.743
Lieutenant Doshi, your
reputation precedes you.

10:54.777 --> 10:57.814
I'm afraid that's my cross to bear.

10:57.846 --> 10:59.782
The candles? I'm sure you waited...

10:59.815 --> 11:02.551
Until the scene was processed. Yes, I did.

11:02.585 --> 11:06.889
Unfortunately, the time
elapsed was far too long.

11:06.922 --> 11:09.625
If Timothy found his way back here,

11:09.658 --> 11:11.628
he did not linger for long.

11:11.661 --> 11:12.929
You mean Timothy's spirit?

11:12.961 --> 11:15.498
No. I mean Timothy himself.

11:15.532 --> 11:17.934
I do not subscribe to the Western dualism

11:17.966 --> 11:19.902
of physical versus spiritual.

11:19.936 --> 11:23.006
When we die, there's not
some part of us that lives on.

11:23.038 --> 11:25.841
It's the whole of us that evolves

11:25.874 --> 11:29.512
into a new and marvelous incarnation.

11:29.546 --> 11:32.883
Uh, if that is true, then why
would Timothy come back here?

11:32.916 --> 11:35.551
Because the real tragedy of murder

11:35.585 --> 11:39.922
is that our transmigration is
so abrupt that we get scared

11:39.955 --> 11:42.825
and try to cling to this flesh and bone,

11:42.859 --> 11:46.729
thus a homicide victim
lingers at his crime scene.

11:46.762 --> 11:49.298
Well, based on the lack of blood evidence,

11:49.331 --> 11:51.867
maybe Timothy didn't come back here

11:51.901 --> 11:54.838
because this wasn't where he
was murdered and mutilated.

11:54.870 --> 11:57.006
- Mm.
- Just where he was staged.

11:57.040 --> 11:59.876
Yeah, staged in close proximity
of where Lara's body was,

11:59.908 --> 12:01.243
just a quarter-mile away.

12:01.277 --> 12:02.912
This Azaria District...

12:02.945 --> 12:04.980
It appears to mean something to our unsub.

12:05.013 --> 12:09.753
But he's a poacher. He likes
to hunt across a wide terrain.

12:09.786 --> 12:11.621
Victoria to Johannesburg...

12:11.653 --> 12:13.822
That's nearly 9,000 square kilometers.

12:13.855 --> 12:16.325
Which isn't inconsistent
with our gang theory.

12:16.359 --> 12:18.762
But the explicit precision of mutilations,

12:18.795 --> 12:20.997
it seems more likely to
be a physical manifestation

12:21.030 --> 12:24.634
of our unsub's internal fantasy psychosis.

12:24.666 --> 12:25.936
You think so?

12:25.969 --> 12:28.104
'Cause I think they
look like very convincing

12:28.137 --> 12:31.308
"don't you dare mess with me" warnings.

12:31.340 --> 12:34.945
Again, not inconsistent with the gang.

12:34.978 --> 12:37.046
The only question is, to whom
are these warnings directed?

12:37.080 --> 12:39.148
Still, why go to all this trouble?

12:39.181 --> 12:42.085
If these are fear
tactics, they seem extreme.

12:42.118 --> 12:43.820
This is South Africa, Jack.

12:43.853 --> 12:45.955
We've been through some serious strife.

12:45.988 --> 12:48.925
If you really want to put
the fear of God into us,

12:48.958 --> 12:51.695
you definitely need to step up your game.

13:06.642 --> 13:07.945
Uhh!

13:12.014 --> 13:14.817
<i>Igazi.</i>

13:14.850 --> 13:18.721
<i>Wena ungufakazi wami.</i>

13:18.754 --> 13:21.090
<i>Iqiniso.</i>

13:23.059 --> 13:25.028
Mariam Nell's physical
description of the gang members

13:25.061 --> 13:27.129
that approached her gave us these.

13:27.162 --> 13:28.797
We have yet to I.D. them.

13:28.830 --> 13:31.000
Okay, if all this is related to the gang,

13:31.033 --> 13:34.069
not only do we need to ask
ourselves about their connection

13:34.103 --> 13:36.039
to the victims, we need to ask, why now?

13:36.071 --> 13:37.272
What's changed for them?

13:37.306 --> 13:39.275
You know what I find most fascinating

13:39.307 --> 13:41.210
about American criminal procedure?

13:41.243 --> 13:42.945
Is the obsessive fixation

13:42.979 --> 13:45.648
with applying logical motivations

13:45.681 --> 13:49.385
to inherently aberrant
and impassioned behaviors.

13:49.418 --> 13:52.688
You would prefer that we
apply a more emotional logic

13:52.721 --> 13:54.089
to our analysis?

13:54.123 --> 13:56.825
At some point, we must draw ourselves

13:56.859 --> 14:00.363
into the hearts and minds
of these unknown subjects.

14:00.396 --> 14:04.200
I disagree. That approach is
self-indulgent and reckless.

14:04.233 --> 14:07.237
And why I would prefer
the guidance of the dead.

14:10.038 --> 14:13.777
Gang or no gang, these
murders aren't just about fear.

14:13.810 --> 14:15.145
They're about recognition.

14:15.177 --> 14:17.046
Bodies left to be found.

14:17.080 --> 14:19.315
The stark brutality of their desecration.

14:19.348 --> 14:22.051
And holding on to a hostage
without so much as a word

14:22.085 --> 14:24.153
to the families or to the authorities,

14:24.186 --> 14:28.157
as if demanding, "Do I have
your undivided attention?"

14:28.190 --> 14:30.192
And he won't stop until he feels satisfied

14:30.225 --> 14:32.695
that we know exactly how much power he has

14:32.729 --> 14:35.031
over life and death.

14:37.032 --> 14:39.702
If we can find a way to deal with Nosumi,

14:39.735 --> 14:41.104
would he sign the contract?

14:41.137 --> 14:43.772
<i>Maar dit is nie wat
hy gesê het nie.</i>

14:45.108 --> 14:47.010
No, we already agreed
that if we throw that in,

14:47.042 --> 14:48.912
then we close the deal.

14:48.945 --> 14:52.147
So come on, Gareth. <i>Dit
is regtig nie moeilik nie.</i>

14:55.151 --> 14:57.721
Gareth? Gareth?

14:57.753 --> 15:00.156
I'm sorry. I have to call you back.

15:10.398 --> 15:12.068
Uhh!

15:29.051 --> 15:30.520
I must say,

15:30.552 --> 15:33.355
I'm surprised you agreed
to work with me again,

15:33.388 --> 15:35.424
considering the way we left it.

15:35.458 --> 15:37.993
Well, experience has taught
me to pick my battles.

15:38.027 --> 15:40.964
Besides, the way we left it was...

15:40.997 --> 15:42.165
You caught the bad guy.

15:42.197 --> 15:43.966
But you still don't trust me.

15:43.999 --> 15:46.869
Trust isn't the issue, is it?

15:46.902 --> 15:49.438
Another body has been
discovered in Botes...

15:49.471 --> 15:51.106
The heart of Azaria.

15:51.139 --> 15:53.509
- Is it Brandon?
- We have yet to make

15:53.542 --> 15:55.344
a positive identification of the victim,

15:55.378 --> 15:57.980
since entry into this particular
quarter of the district

15:58.013 --> 15:59.315
is precarious.

15:59.348 --> 16:01.050
Well, let's gear up and get going.

16:01.083 --> 16:03.052
I'm afraid I cannot allow it.

16:03.085 --> 16:05.254
But we were allowed access
to the last crime scene

16:05.287 --> 16:06.955
under similar circumstances.

16:06.988 --> 16:08.925
Regrettably, local law
enforcement has ceded

16:08.958 --> 16:13.062
control of certain
neighborhoods to gang elements.

16:13.094 --> 16:14.897
It would be best for my officers and me

16:14.931 --> 16:16.431
to secure the crime scene.

16:16.464 --> 16:19.301
Lieutenant Doshi, if you would. Excuse us.

16:19.335 --> 16:20.836
Wait. Hold on. How come she gets to go?

16:20.869 --> 16:22.437
Because she talks to the dead,

16:22.470 --> 16:25.107
and they do not bide at the scene for long.

16:25.141 --> 16:26.910
Does one of you speak to the dead, too?

16:26.942 --> 16:28.844
He can.

17:02.444 --> 17:04.847
You good?

17:10.452 --> 17:11.988
Clear!

17:22.597 --> 17:24.133
You want we should let you bleed out

17:24.165 --> 17:25.500
- right here in the street?
- No, no, no, no!

17:25.534 --> 17:28.171
Who ordered you to take us out?

17:28.203 --> 17:30.940
Ingwe! It was Ingwe!

17:30.972 --> 17:32.207
Who the hell is Ingwe?!

17:32.240 --> 17:35.110
Probably an alias. We will run it.

17:35.143 --> 17:37.447
_

17:40.548 --> 17:43.051
I'm going to order a lockdown of Botes.

17:43.085 --> 17:43.986
That is 20 square blocks.

17:44.019 --> 17:46.256
I won't be able to hold it for very long.

17:46.288 --> 17:48.157
I get it. We need to work fast.

17:59.468 --> 18:01.604
That's not Brandon.

18:01.636 --> 18:03.339
No, it's not.

18:04.239 --> 18:07.109
Older than Brandon, but not by much.

18:07.142 --> 18:10.145
And there's been no missing
persons report recently,

18:10.179 --> 18:12.015
so no one's had any time to miss him.

18:12.047 --> 18:14.450
Our unsub's window between
abduction and staging

18:14.482 --> 18:16.085
is closing.

18:16.117 --> 18:18.987
Don't move. You'll frighten him.

18:19.020 --> 18:22.392
Let us bring you peace on your journey.

18:22.424 --> 18:25.193
<i>Ngubani owenze lokhu kuwe.</i>

18:25.227 --> 18:28.197
Please.

18:28.229 --> 18:30.199
<i>Ungahambi.</i>

18:30.231 --> 18:32.501
Oh! No.

18:40.343 --> 18:44.046
He's gone.

18:44.079 --> 18:46.081
Ananda, we don't have time for this.

18:46.114 --> 18:47.349
Brandon is still out there.

18:47.383 --> 18:48.951
They're related...

18:48.985 --> 18:52.021
This man and the woman,
the lawyer, Lara Bosch.

18:52.054 --> 18:54.223
Besides that little voice inside your head,

18:54.256 --> 18:57.192
- how do you know that?
- It's <i>his</i> voice, Jack.

18:57.226 --> 18:59.529
Well, it's speaking to me,
too, and so is this scene.

18:59.562 --> 19:01.497
Our unsub was right here.

19:01.529 --> 19:04.299
Based on the wounds, this
accelerated pattern of attack,

19:04.333 --> 19:06.335
I'd say it was less than two hours ago.

19:06.369 --> 19:08.071
Which means he came prepared.

19:08.104 --> 19:11.239
Which means he executes with
military-style precision.

19:11.273 --> 19:13.743
So we may be looking for someone trained

19:13.776 --> 19:15.111
as a child soldier

19:15.143 --> 19:17.980
in the Congo, Sierra Leone, or the Sudan.

19:18.014 --> 19:19.282
That would be in step

19:19.315 --> 19:21.616
with his need to send this message of fear.

19:21.650 --> 19:23.987
I agree. Agent Seger was right.

19:24.019 --> 19:27.589
This <i>is</i> a manifestation
of a inner fantasy psychosis.

19:27.623 --> 19:29.624
Whoever we're dealing with,

19:29.658 --> 19:32.662
he's existing in a psychic borderland,

19:32.694 --> 19:35.163
straddling the line between this reality

19:35.197 --> 19:38.101
and the fantasy world
he's creating for himself.

19:38.133 --> 19:40.135
With that kind of dysfunction,

19:40.169 --> 19:42.005
he'll probably need to hide
behind someone else's identity.

19:42.037 --> 19:47.210
Or possibly even masquerade
in another creature's persona.

20:03.191 --> 20:06.796
Kill me already! Just get it over with!

20:06.828 --> 20:09.531
You must bear witness.

20:09.565 --> 20:11.566
You will be the one after the reckoning

20:11.600 --> 20:13.169
who tells them all the truth.

20:13.201 --> 20:15.805
<i>Iqiniso.</i>

20:20.108 --> 20:21.143
You have news about Brandon?

20:21.177 --> 20:23.679
No, not yet. I'm sorry.

20:23.711 --> 20:26.281
There's just a discrepancy
I found I'd like to clear up.

20:26.315 --> 20:28.383
- What do you mean?
- Well...

20:28.417 --> 20:30.553
South African documents indicate

20:30.585 --> 20:32.488
that Brandon was born there.

20:32.520 --> 20:35.223
But your wife's records
reveal adoption papers for him.

20:35.257 --> 20:38.193
Agent Montgomery, maybe
it has something to do

20:38.227 --> 20:40.496
with my having started the process

20:40.528 --> 20:42.664
of adopting Brandon in the U.S.

20:42.698 --> 20:45.535
Before Armand and I
married in South Africa.

20:45.567 --> 20:47.135
Does it really matter

20:47.169 --> 20:49.405
if Brandon is not our biological son?

20:49.438 --> 20:51.306
No, no, of course not.

20:51.340 --> 20:53.242
I'm just trying to understand
why there's a difference

20:53.275 --> 20:55.344
between South African
documents and American.

20:55.376 --> 20:57.680
Obviously, someone made a clerical error

20:57.712 --> 21:00.383
8,000 miles away.

21:07.323 --> 21:08.825
General Zwane wanted you to know

21:08.857 --> 21:11.426
that they have identified
the subject known as "Ingwe,"

21:11.460 --> 21:13.595
the man who ordered the attack on our team.

21:13.629 --> 21:15.465
It's an alias for Paul Ntombi.

21:15.498 --> 21:18.801
Says here he was suspected of
being a top Ibhuloho lieutenant.

21:18.834 --> 21:21.604
Even though he's been
behind bars for 25 years.

21:21.636 --> 21:24.673
Kidnapped as a boy, Ntombi was
a child soldier in Mozambique.

21:24.707 --> 21:27.510
Now we believe he's been in
control of the Ibhuloho Gang

21:27.543 --> 21:30.179
- for more than a decade.
- That's interesting.

21:30.211 --> 21:32.381
Possibly reaching out from prison.

21:32.413 --> 21:34.450
He very well could be
the man behind our unsub.

21:34.482 --> 21:36.685
So we might just wanna have
a little chat with this guy.

21:39.654 --> 21:42.791
Did you know capital punishment
was abolished in South Africa

21:42.825 --> 21:45.228
on the 6th of June, 1995?

21:45.260 --> 21:47.629
So hypothetically, if I
were involved with this,

21:47.662 --> 21:50.565
since I am serving life, how
do you imagine punishing me?

21:50.598 --> 21:52.400
Well, hypothetically, Paul,

21:52.433 --> 21:55.837
international laws regarding
criminal conspiracies

21:55.871 --> 21:57.873
resulting in the death of Americans

21:57.906 --> 21:59.808
leans pretty heavy in our favor.

21:59.842 --> 22:01.777
Meaning we could pack
you up, take you home,

22:01.809 --> 22:03.912
where a lethal injection
will be waiting for you.

22:05.413 --> 22:08.584
Ah, yes, you Americans, mmh.

22:08.616 --> 22:11.921
Always with your "kill them
all, let God sort them out."

22:11.953 --> 22:13.421
I love it.

22:13.454 --> 22:15.657
Hey, we are not playing games here.

22:15.690 --> 22:18.361
This is all a game, my dear.

22:18.393 --> 22:20.429
Why do you think General Zwane
wants you to waste your time

22:20.461 --> 22:22.265
- talking to me?
- We're talking to you

22:22.297 --> 22:23.766
because you ordered some
of your boys to kill us.

22:23.798 --> 22:25.902
And we think that order has
something to do with the fact

22:25.934 --> 22:27.836
that you're trying to
protect whoever's doing this.

22:27.870 --> 22:29.472
We can link your gang to the victims

22:29.505 --> 22:30.773
and you to a suspect.

22:30.806 --> 22:32.674
It's only a matter of time, Paul.

22:32.708 --> 22:34.643
But you help us catch this killer,

22:34.677 --> 22:37.714
you can stay here, serving
life like nothing ever happened.

22:43.852 --> 22:45.287
The thing is,

22:45.321 --> 22:48.457
I don't want you to catch him.

22:48.489 --> 22:49.825
As far as I'm concerned,

22:49.857 --> 22:51.760
not enough Afrikaans blood has been spilled

22:51.794 --> 22:53.763
to make up for the blood of my ancestors.

22:53.796 --> 22:56.298
Yeah, I'd say you've really
done your ancestors proud,

22:56.332 --> 22:58.334
killing and enslaving
your brothers over drugs.

22:58.366 --> 23:00.702
Don't you lecture me about my history.

23:00.736 --> 23:02.537
If it weren't for Mandela,

23:02.571 --> 23:05.208
there'd be no need for Ibhuloho.

23:05.240 --> 23:07.410
If Madiba would have
done what was necessary

23:07.442 --> 23:09.478
and exterminate the white devil,

23:09.510 --> 23:11.379
there'd be plenty for all my people.

23:11.412 --> 23:13.449
And what, you think you're the savior

23:13.481 --> 23:14.783
of all those left behind?

23:14.816 --> 23:16.451
Let me tell you something.

23:16.485 --> 23:18.621
You are nothing but a parasite.

23:20.288 --> 23:22.857
I will tell you something.

23:22.891 --> 23:24.893
You want to know what this is? Hmm?

23:24.927 --> 23:26.629
"Helter Skelter."

23:26.662 --> 23:28.698
The beginning of the end.

23:28.730 --> 23:31.400
There is a debt of blood out there,

23:31.432 --> 23:33.536
and I will tell you, my dear,

23:33.568 --> 23:36.571
payback is a bitch.

23:36.604 --> 23:38.274
<i>20 square blocks</i>

23:38.306 --> 23:39.976
<i>of the Botes Neighborhood of Azaria</i>

23:40.008 --> 23:42.478
<i>continue to be cordoned off by
law enforcement this evening</i>

23:42.510 --> 23:44.779
<i>as the manhunt continues
for the suspects responsible</i>

23:44.813 --> 23:47.450
<i>for the brutal slayings
of Attorney Lara Bosch,</i>

23:47.482 --> 23:49.317
<i>American tourist Timothy Smit,</i>

23:49.351 --> 23:52.388
<i>and what is now a third, yet
unidentified male victim.</i>

23:52.421 --> 23:54.289
<i>The suspects are also
believed to be holding</i>

23:54.323 --> 23:56.359
- <i>American Brandon Smit...</i>
- Brandon Smit.

23:58.027 --> 23:59.828
You don't think he could
be your old friend's son,

23:59.862 --> 24:01.964
do you, Pa?

24:01.997 --> 24:04.533
- Pa?
- What?

24:04.565 --> 24:06.402
Brandon. Armand's oldest boy.

24:06.434 --> 24:08.703
No, it can't be.

24:08.737 --> 24:11.340
Armand and his family moved away years ago.

24:11.373 --> 24:12.842
<i>Ja,</i> to the U.S.

24:12.874 --> 24:13.192
_

24:14.354 --> 24:15.622
_

24:19.315 --> 24:21.383
It can't be the same boy.

24:28.524 --> 24:30.593
I got an I.D. on our John Doe.

24:30.625 --> 24:34.329
I pulled titanium dental implant
that had a P.N. number on it

24:34.363 --> 24:36.766
which traced back to a local dentist,

24:36.798 --> 24:39.434
who had a patient by
the name of Kurt Adams.

24:39.468 --> 24:41.037
Now here's the kicker...

24:41.069 --> 24:43.838
Family court records
indicate that Kurt Adams

24:43.872 --> 24:45.608
is Lara Bosch's half-brother.

24:45.641 --> 24:47.043
Doesn't actually look

24:47.075 --> 24:48.810
like Lara knew she had a brother.

24:48.844 --> 24:50.446
Says here that Kurt is the illegitimate son

24:50.479 --> 24:52.014
of her father, Rowan Bosch.

24:52.046 --> 24:54.416
Okay, and here's where
it gets even more curious.

24:54.450 --> 24:56.951
As far as anyone can
tell, Rowan is still alive,

24:56.985 --> 24:59.488
but four weeks ago, when the
police tried to notify him

24:59.520 --> 25:01.556
of his daughter's death,
he was nowhere to be found.

25:01.590 --> 25:03.859
So you're not thinking he's a suspect.

25:03.892 --> 25:05.527
I don't know what I'm thinking,

25:05.560 --> 25:08.396
but I don't think it's a
coincidence that our victims

25:08.430 --> 25:11.033
are either the offspring of
Rowan Bosch or Armand Smit.

25:11.065 --> 25:12.567
So there has to be some kind of connection

25:12.601 --> 25:13.969
between the two fathers.

25:14.001 --> 25:16.404
Jack, hand me Paul Ntombi's file.

25:16.438 --> 25:19.441
You think you know a link
between Ntombi and the fathers?

25:19.475 --> 25:20.743
I think I now remember

25:20.776 --> 25:22.878
seeing this <i>umkovu</i>
mutilation before.

25:24.513 --> 25:27.717
Yes. Ntombi was detained for questioning

25:27.749 --> 25:30.118
on February 5, 1989,

25:30.152 --> 25:33.488
in connection with the murder
of Constable Sara Miller.

25:33.521 --> 25:35.890
Why is that significant?

25:35.923 --> 25:37.526
I'll show you.

25:37.558 --> 25:39.427
Constable Sara Miller...

25:39.460 --> 25:43.065
Her assassination in the winter of 1989

25:43.097 --> 25:45.901
set South African Defense
Forces on high alert,

25:45.933 --> 25:48.503
particularly the Office of State Security.

25:48.537 --> 25:51.006
- That's like South Africa's K.G.B.
- Only worse.

25:51.038 --> 25:54.809
Their sole purpose was to
preserve and protect apartheid

25:54.843 --> 25:56.479
by any means necessary.

25:56.511 --> 25:59.381
In its dying days, the
Office of State Security

25:59.414 --> 26:01.883
used Constable Miller's martyrdom

26:01.917 --> 26:05.020
as an excuse to form a covert unit

26:05.053 --> 26:08.591
to stamp out the anti-apartheid
movement once and for all.

26:08.623 --> 26:10.526
It was code-named "Pretorius."

26:10.558 --> 26:13.395
In 11 months, Pretorius was
responsible for the torture

26:13.429 --> 26:16.899
and murder of 14 anti-apartheid activists.

26:16.931 --> 26:18.433
But I suspect no one knew

26:18.467 --> 26:19.668
what crimes Pretorius had committed

26:19.700 --> 26:21.437
until after the fall of apartheid.

26:21.469 --> 26:24.539
1995, when the truth and
reconciliation commission

26:24.573 --> 26:25.574
was formed.

26:25.606 --> 26:27.075
That's where this comes from.

26:27.108 --> 26:29.110
Yes, the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission

26:29.143 --> 26:32.547
was set up as an open forum for
people to confess their crimes

26:32.581 --> 26:34.116
without fear of prosecution.

26:34.149 --> 26:36.886
And in the name of national reconciliation,

26:36.919 --> 26:40.523
the names of the three Pretorius
agents were never disclosed,

26:40.556 --> 26:44.460
their crimes against
humanity never to be punished.

26:44.492 --> 26:47.862
And so it would seem that
like my fellow South Africans,

26:47.895 --> 26:52.133
I've not only tried to forgive,
apparently I nearly forgot.

26:52.167 --> 26:53.068
And now years later,

26:53.102 --> 26:56.138
our unsub mimics this particular murder.

26:56.171 --> 26:58.974
Because maybe he's
identified these three men

26:59.007 --> 27:02.111
and is now targeting
their children for revenge.

27:02.143 --> 27:05.013
The cruelest punishment of all
is for a parent to bury a child.

27:05.046 --> 27:07.482
In this case, child by blood, if we believe

27:07.516 --> 27:09.051
that he's keeping Brandon alive.

27:09.084 --> 27:10.518
Okay, not to be the naysayer here,

27:10.552 --> 27:12.221
but accusing Rowan Bosch and Armand Smit

27:12.254 --> 27:14.523
of being part of this group
is a pretty serious thing.

27:14.556 --> 27:16.525
I would feel a lot more
comfortable if we had

27:16.557 --> 27:18.560
- more to go on than just a theory.
- I'll have Monty follow up

27:18.594 --> 27:20.595
with the covert history on Bosch and Smit.

27:20.629 --> 27:24.200
We might find something in one
of our own intelligence files.

27:24.232 --> 27:25.667
You know, with this latest crime scene,

27:25.700 --> 27:27.036
I think we might have enough data

27:27.068 --> 27:28.537
for Simmons and I to head back to the jet

27:28.569 --> 27:29.871
and build a geo-profile.

27:29.904 --> 27:32.508
And Agent Jarvis and I can
run our criminal profile

27:32.540 --> 27:34.809
against a new pool of potential suspects...

27:34.843 --> 27:38.180
The surviving family members
of Pretorius' victims.

27:38.212 --> 27:40.248
Okay, let's get to work.

27:52.059 --> 27:55.864
Mr. Smit, I have something
I need to show you.

27:56.899 --> 27:58.734
You recognize this man?

28:00.102 --> 28:01.836
- Sorry, I don't know him.
- Okay.

28:01.870 --> 28:04.006
Well, you can clear up one
more discrepancy for me.

28:04.038 --> 28:06.241
This man's name is Rowan Bosch.

28:06.275 --> 28:08.177
You two have something
very interesting in common.

28:08.210 --> 28:09.944
Neither one of you is on record as serving

28:09.978 --> 28:11.680
in the South African Defense Force.

28:11.712 --> 28:13.081
What's interesting about that

28:13.114 --> 28:14.650
is that military service was compulsory

28:14.682 --> 28:17.018
for all white males until 1993.

28:17.052 --> 28:18.921
What are you insinuating, <i>son?</i>

28:18.953 --> 28:22.858
That'd be "Agent Montgomery," <i>sir.</i>

28:24.058 --> 28:25.960
We have reason to believe
that Timothy was murdered

28:25.994 --> 28:29.899
and Brandon was taken
as payback for Pretorius.

28:34.001 --> 28:37.171
You were one of them, weren't you?

28:37.204 --> 28:40.642
How dare you accuse me of that?

28:40.675 --> 28:42.677
What in God's name is wrong with you?

28:42.710 --> 28:46.114
What about my son? Where is he?

28:46.148 --> 28:47.783
I swear, if he dies,

28:47.815 --> 28:50.286
I will hold you personally responsible,

28:50.318 --> 28:53.055
<i>Agent</i> Montgomery.

28:56.758 --> 28:58.561
I'm sorry, Jack.

28:58.594 --> 29:00.328
I shouldn't have confronted him like that.

29:00.362 --> 29:02.730
Just when I compared the two bios,

29:02.764 --> 29:04.767
I realized I had seen
the pattern of detail,

29:04.799 --> 29:06.267
or lack thereof, before,

29:06.300 --> 29:08.269
in cover stories created
for Witness Protection.

29:08.303 --> 29:10.639
Then he had the nerve to
look me in the eye and lie.

29:10.671 --> 29:12.975
But his deflection confirms our theory.

29:13.008 --> 29:15.244
He and Bosch are two of the
three agents of Pretorius.

29:15.277 --> 29:18.113
And now we're face-to-face
with one of the men responsible

29:18.145 --> 29:20.615
for torturing and murdering
14 innocent people...

29:20.649 --> 29:22.051
People who were just
fighting for their freedom,

29:22.084 --> 29:23.318
and there's not a damn thing we can do

29:23.352 --> 29:24.753
to bring them to justice.

29:24.786 --> 29:26.654
I know, but I think
the best thing right now

29:26.688 --> 29:28.056
is to remember the sins of the father

29:28.090 --> 29:29.792
have nothing to do with the son.

29:29.825 --> 29:32.061
We need to stay focused
on saving Brandon's life.

29:32.094 --> 29:33.863
You're right.

29:35.963 --> 29:37.799
How's it looking?

29:37.833 --> 29:39.835
Oh, well, the biggest
challenge has been reconciling

29:39.867 --> 29:41.903
the two axioms of serial killer behavior.

29:41.937 --> 29:43.939
Right... never commit a
crime too close to home,

29:43.971 --> 29:45.807
and never travel further than necessary

29:45.841 --> 29:48.077
- to get your victims.
- But our unsub is a poacher.

29:48.110 --> 29:49.745
He's willing to go the extra mile.

29:49.777 --> 29:52.113
Which complicates the math for our model.

29:52.146 --> 29:53.748
But Monty hooked us up with this program

29:53.781 --> 29:55.650
that helps us compare
the patterns of our unsub

29:55.683 --> 29:57.286
with the patterns of past serial killers

29:57.318 --> 29:59.654
active in similar urban terrain.

29:59.688 --> 30:02.925
So... it should be able to calculate

30:02.958 --> 30:06.027
the highest probable location
of our unsub's home, sweet home.

30:06.060 --> 30:07.762
Nice work.

30:07.796 --> 30:10.699
Looks like our unsub may be
somewhere in Briars Point.

30:10.731 --> 30:12.867
Yeah, but by home, we're
probably not talking

30:12.901 --> 30:15.304
about his residence.
This guy wants isolation.

30:15.336 --> 30:19.374
So he might just like this old
Norris Mining Industries Plant

30:19.408 --> 30:20.876
which closed in 1975.

30:20.909 --> 30:22.844
Clara, you coordinate
from the command post.

30:22.877 --> 30:26.114
Simmons and I will round up
General Zwane and his men.

30:56.877 --> 30:58.681
- Brandon.
- Let me go. Please.

30:58.713 --> 30:59.815
- Brandon.
- What?

30:59.847 --> 31:02.084
Hey. You're gonna be all right, son.

31:02.116 --> 31:05.119
I'm Jack Garrett, FBI. You're safe.

31:11.192 --> 31:13.061
FBI! Don't move!

31:13.094 --> 31:14.896
Drop your weapon!

31:14.930 --> 31:16.465
Drop it!

31:16.498 --> 31:18.867
<i>Beka phansi isibhamu!</i>

31:25.340 --> 31:28.110
Do not move! I will shoot!

31:29.376 --> 31:31.279
His arm's tied to the chair.

31:49.831 --> 31:51.333
Oh, my God.

31:51.365 --> 31:52.902
It's Rowan Bosch.

31:55.036 --> 31:57.472
Son of a bitch lobotomized him.

32:02.244 --> 32:04.012
Thanks.

32:04.045 --> 32:05.279
So Bosch is in critical condition.

32:05.313 --> 32:06.849
Brandon appears to be stable.

32:06.882 --> 32:08.249
They're both on their
way to the hospital now.

32:08.283 --> 32:09.918
- Well, that's good news.
- Yeah.

32:09.950 --> 32:11.219
Bad news is, our unsub staged the scene

32:11.252 --> 32:12.920
like he knew we were coming.

32:12.953 --> 32:15.123
<i>Or he knew this was his end game.</i>

32:15.156 --> 32:17.925
Maybe our beast is on his final hunt.

32:17.959 --> 32:19.827
Where are we in running the profile

32:19.861 --> 32:21.130
against our victims' families?

32:21.162 --> 32:22.797
Nowhere is where we are.

32:22.831 --> 32:24.299
There's not one viable suspect in the pool.

32:24.332 --> 32:27.201
And there's still one more
agent of Pretorius to identify.

32:27.235 --> 32:28.937
Even if he is dead,

32:28.969 --> 32:30.271
his children or blood
relatives are in danger.

32:30.305 --> 32:32.874
- There's something we're missing. <i>
- About what?</i>

32:32.908 --> 32:35.310
- The victims? Pretorius?
- I'm not sure, but I don't think

32:35.343 --> 32:36.979
we're looking at this the right way.

32:37.011 --> 32:38.980
I mean, it was the last gasp of apartheid.

32:39.014 --> 32:40.382
<i>Even President Botha</i>

32:40.414 --> 32:41.849
<i>was willing to negotiate
with Mandela for peace.</i>

32:41.883 --> 32:43.117
Something had to be done,

32:43.151 --> 32:45.321
especially in this security state where...

32:47.454 --> 32:49.123
Where white is black,

32:49.156 --> 32:51.893
and black is white.

32:56.597 --> 32:58.966
Okay, there was a man named David Lubbe.

32:58.999 --> 33:00.335
He was arrested and confessed

33:00.367 --> 33:02.837
<i>to killing Miller.
He died in prison.</i>

33:02.871 --> 33:04.339
Monty?

33:04.372 --> 33:06.341
<i>Clara, what if the murder
of Constable Miller</i>

33:06.373 --> 33:07.843
<i>was a false flag?</i>

33:07.875 --> 33:09.411
What if it had been this covert op

33:09.443 --> 33:12.079
that was designed to incite
the social unrest necessary

33:12.113 --> 33:14.016
to justify the creation of Pretorius?

33:14.048 --> 33:15.483
Well, if that's true...

33:15.517 --> 33:16.919
Well, then we need to apply our profile

33:16.951 --> 33:18.520
to the family of Sara Miller.

33:22.289 --> 33:24.358
Do you remember Constable Miller?

33:24.392 --> 33:26.228
You remember what you
and your Pretorius boys

33:26.260 --> 33:28.564
did to my sister?

33:28.596 --> 33:30.164
I have no idea what you're talking about.

33:30.198 --> 33:31.566
You have the wrong man!

33:32.968 --> 33:34.503
The wrong man went to prison.

33:34.536 --> 33:37.372
And he died there.

33:37.404 --> 33:39.373
Rowan Bosch told me everything.

33:39.406 --> 33:42.877
He came to me, dying of
cancer, asking for forgiveness.

33:42.911 --> 33:45.980
Even had documents to prove every word.

33:46.014 --> 33:48.417
Please. There must be
something that I could...

33:48.450 --> 33:50.384
- You could do?
- Yes.

33:50.418 --> 33:53.522
Hmm. You can wait with me
for your little girl Lydia

33:53.555 --> 33:56.123
to come home, and you can
watch as I spill her blood

33:56.156 --> 33:57.558
all over this floor.

33:57.592 --> 33:58.594
Her blood, and the
blood of your grandchild.

34:06.401 --> 34:09.337
Constable Sara Miller's family
was devastated by her death,

34:09.370 --> 34:11.405
none more so than her brother Curtis.

34:11.438 --> 34:14.275
He attended David Lubbe's trial every day

34:14.308 --> 34:16.143
and later received a discharge

34:16.176 --> 34:19.045
from the South African
National Defense Force

34:19.080 --> 34:21.616
based on concerns about his mental health.

34:21.649 --> 34:24.252
Says here Miller's
parents passed away in 2000

34:24.284 --> 34:25.585
and Curtis inherited the family home

34:25.620 --> 34:27.388
in Auckland Park.

34:27.422 --> 34:28.891
Which S.F.B. officers just raided.

34:28.924 --> 34:30.225
There was nothing there.

34:30.257 --> 34:31.460
Looks like he cleared out weeks ago.

34:31.493 --> 34:33.094
So Curtis Miller's in the wind,

34:33.127 --> 34:35.463
and we still don't know who
this third Pretorius agent is.

34:35.496 --> 34:37.531
- His children are in imminent danger.
- Monty,

34:37.563 --> 34:39.467
<i>you've held off notifying
Armand Smit and his wife</i>

34:39.500 --> 34:41.136
<i>about Brandon's rescue, right?</i>

34:41.168 --> 34:43.906
- As you requested.
- So now we have no choice.

34:43.938 --> 34:46.607
The only way to get the name
of that third Pretorius agent

34:46.639 --> 34:48.976
is for Monty to get it from Smit himself.

34:49.009 --> 34:51.946
But doesn't he actually have
to admit who he is first?

34:51.980 --> 34:54.350
That's exactly what he has to do.

34:57.642 --> 34:59.845
So... I have news about your son.

35:01.012 --> 35:02.847
We rescued him.

35:02.880 --> 35:04.849
He's alive and recovering
at Brisbane Hospital.

35:04.883 --> 35:07.253
Oh!

35:08.720 --> 35:11.724
He was found with Rowan Bosch...

35:11.756 --> 35:14.526
Or what's left of him.

35:16.727 --> 35:18.697
Rowan Bosch?

35:18.729 --> 35:22.267
Is... is he related to
that woman you showed us?

35:22.300 --> 35:24.035
Yes.

35:24.068 --> 35:25.704
He was her father.

35:25.737 --> 35:29.541
He worked with your husband in Pretorius.

35:29.573 --> 35:30.909
Pretorius?

35:30.941 --> 35:32.910
This is harassment.

35:32.943 --> 35:35.413
I'll sue you and the Bureau.

35:35.447 --> 35:37.282
Armand, what's going on?

35:37.316 --> 35:40.352
You go ahead and do that, Mr. Smit.

35:40.385 --> 35:41.987
But right now is what my
grandmother likes to call

35:42.019 --> 35:43.621
a "come to Jesus" time.

35:43.655 --> 35:45.758
There are lives at stake.

35:45.791 --> 35:48.727
I know you and Bosch were
two of three men in Pretorius.

35:48.760 --> 35:50.863
I'm gonna need that third man's name,

35:50.896 --> 35:54.633
before his children suffer the same fate

35:54.666 --> 35:57.936
as Kurt...

35:57.968 --> 36:02.340
And Lara...

36:02.374 --> 36:04.376
And Timothy,

36:04.409 --> 36:07.680
your own son.

36:09.814 --> 36:11.517
What did you do?

36:11.550 --> 36:13.552
Nothing. I did nothing wrong.

36:13.584 --> 36:15.653
Seriously? You're just gonna let the blood

36:15.686 --> 36:17.689
of that man's children be on your hands?

36:17.722 --> 36:18.791
Let's go, Camille.

36:18.823 --> 36:20.459
Oh, you think the blood

36:20.492 --> 36:21.794
will just blend in with all the rest, huh?

36:21.827 --> 36:24.530
Hey! Look at him!

36:28.800 --> 36:32.037
Now give me the man's name.

36:36.874 --> 36:39.544
I knew there were secrets about your past,

36:39.577 --> 36:41.412
but... I loved you,

36:41.445 --> 36:45.950
so I never asked you any questions.

36:45.983 --> 36:48.554
We knew a Bosch once.

36:48.586 --> 36:51.889
When we first met.

36:51.923 --> 36:53.758
And there was another man.

36:53.791 --> 36:56.427
- Camille, please.
- His name was...

36:56.461 --> 36:58.564
Coetzee.

36:58.597 --> 37:01.700
Noah Coetzee.

37:01.733 --> 37:04.470
He may still live in Bloemfontein.

37:06.771 --> 37:08.974
Thank you.

37:20.452 --> 37:22.454
Pa?

37:22.487 --> 37:23.956
- No!
- Pa?

37:23.988 --> 37:25.990
Lydia! Get out!

37:26.023 --> 37:27.992
Uhh!

37:28.026 --> 37:29.661
Aah!

37:29.693 --> 37:31.896
No! No! Oh!

37:31.930 --> 37:34.133
My baby, please! Please, my baby!

37:34.166 --> 37:37.436
- No, please.
- Noah, look at this.

37:37.468 --> 37:38.836
My baby, please.

37:38.869 --> 37:42.640
Let her go. Kill me. I did it.

37:42.673 --> 37:46.579
What did you do? Tell me. Tell her.

37:50.881 --> 37:53.985
I murdered your sister.

37:54.019 --> 37:57.488
Armand, Rowan, and I, we ambushed her

37:57.521 --> 38:02.026
when she was on patrol in Azaria.

38:02.059 --> 38:04.028
I wanted to shoot her,

38:04.061 --> 38:06.931
but Rowan wanted to make it look more Zulu.

38:06.965 --> 38:09.635
So Armand stabbed her.

38:09.668 --> 38:12.738
And I knew the young
man we could pin it on.

38:15.740 --> 38:17.443
- FBI.
- Let her go.

38:17.476 --> 38:18.943
Get out.

38:18.976 --> 38:20.878
Curtis, we know the truth
about your sister's murder,

38:20.912 --> 38:23.482
and we're here now to
punish the men responsible,

38:23.514 --> 38:25.550
so you don't have to hurt this
woman and her baby. Let her go.

38:25.584 --> 38:28.220
You cannot punish these men.
They're protected forever.

38:28.253 --> 38:30.222
No, Curtis, you don't understand.

38:30.255 --> 38:32.724
So I will end them forever.

38:32.756 --> 38:34.626
Please.

38:34.659 --> 38:36.093
No!

39:09.026 --> 39:12.231
You have a good team.
You should be very proud.

39:12.264 --> 39:15.099
- I am.
- I understand why you think

39:15.133 --> 39:18.570
my methods diminish the
science of criminal profiling.

39:18.602 --> 39:21.005
- It's not magic.
- No, it isn't,

39:21.039 --> 39:22.874
but I wish you could understand

39:22.907 --> 39:25.043
that you and I are not
as different as you think.

39:25.075 --> 39:28.780
In every fiber, in every print,

39:28.813 --> 39:32.117
in every drop of blood left behind,

39:32.150 --> 39:35.052
are not the dead speaking to you, Jack?

39:35.086 --> 39:38.090
In a manner of speaking, yes.

39:38.122 --> 39:40.592
But maybe what's most important

39:40.624 --> 39:44.195
is that I speak for them.

40:06.017 --> 40:08.220
Brandon?

40:11.689 --> 40:14.126
Oh, my baby.

40:14.159 --> 40:16.294
Mom.

40:16.327 --> 40:19.096
Armand Smit...

40:19.130 --> 40:20.932
You're under arrest for murder.

40:20.965 --> 40:23.801
Murder? What murder? What
are you talking about?

40:23.834 --> 40:26.137
Stop! I have complete immunity.

40:26.171 --> 40:28.974
- The Commission decreed it.
- You're right.

40:29.006 --> 40:31.142
You have immunity for the
14 murders you committed

40:31.175 --> 40:33.044
while you were an agent of Pretorius.

40:33.077 --> 40:35.079
But not for the one that created it.

40:35.113 --> 40:38.083
The staged execution of
Constable Sara Miller.

40:38.115 --> 40:40.818
And there is no statute
of limitations on murder.

40:40.851 --> 40:42.920
Court's already granted your extradition.

40:42.954 --> 40:46.124
You're going home to stand trial.

40:50.862 --> 40:52.865
Get him out of here.

40:58.202 --> 41:02.206
It may have been delayed,
but justice wasn't denied.
