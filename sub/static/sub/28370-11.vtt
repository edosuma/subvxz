22:55.896 --> 22:56.853
Okay.

22:59.856 --> 23:01.162
Hey.

23:01.205 --> 23:02.816
Thanks.

23:04.165 --> 23:05.819
I just want to say I'm sorry.

23:05.862 --> 23:08.125
You were right-- I should
never have made that arrest.

23:08.169 --> 23:09.475
It was sloppy.

23:09.518 --> 23:10.867
As it stands,

23:10.911 --> 23:12.913
I think I was wrong.

23:12.956 --> 23:15.350
I thought they indicted him.They did.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.526
But I think someone's
framing him.

23:17.570 --> 23:19.920
Framing him?
Jules, come on.

23:19.963 --> 23:22.313
Darnell was Tyson's boss--
he probably found out

23:22.357 --> 23:24.751
that he was selling
to somebody else.

23:24.794 --> 23:27.144
We've seen this kind of thing
happen a thousand times.

23:27.188 --> 23:29.059
Darnell's DNA was found

23:29.103 --> 23:32.280
on Tyson's steering wheel
from dental floss.

23:32.323 --> 23:34.282
And I found footage
of a guard taking the trash

23:34.325 --> 23:36.545
out of his holding cell
the day the DNA showed up.

23:36.589 --> 23:37.677
Jules...Sarah,

23:37.720 --> 23:39.200
this whole Tyson case might be

23:39.243 --> 23:40.767
being orchestrated
by someone. I mean,

23:40.810 --> 23:42.290
I'm starting
to second-guess

23:42.333 --> 23:45.424
if the Wesley theory
even holds water anymore.

23:45.467 --> 23:48.078
You compromised a case that
I have been building for months

23:48.122 --> 23:50.516
for an arrest you're
now telling me was wrong?

23:50.559 --> 23:51.821
I don't even know

23:51.865 --> 23:54.563
what to say to you
at this point.

23:56.043 --> 23:57.436
REBECCA:
Hi.

23:57.479 --> 23:59.002
You must be Felix?That's me.

23:59.046 --> 24:01.396
Hi.Felix Bell, CEO. Hi.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.442
Look at those little cuties.

24:03.485 --> 24:04.878
REBECCA:
Yes, they're very excited

24:04.921 --> 24:06.662
to go get trained.Let me just say

24:06.706 --> 24:09.099
I hope this is the start
of a real synergy

24:09.143 --> 24:12.668
between your beautiful puppies
and my beautiful company.

24:12.712 --> 24:14.409
Same here.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.106
Oh. So, uh,

24:16.150 --> 24:17.891
this is for you,
mademoiselle.Oh.

24:17.934 --> 24:19.066
[laughs]Thank you.

24:19.109 --> 24:20.459
Yes.Where's your vehicle?

24:20.502 --> 24:21.677
Just there.

24:21.721 --> 24:23.723
Oh. The Chevy?

24:23.766 --> 24:25.420
It's a classic.
[chuckles]

24:25.464 --> 24:26.856
And who's that man?

24:26.900 --> 24:29.293
No one.

24:29.337 --> 24:31.905
You don't have a...
a van with crates?

24:31.948 --> 24:34.951
Oh, no. Yeah,
of-of course we do.

24:34.995 --> 24:37.345
Just not...
at this moment.

24:37.388 --> 24:39.869
But plenty
of space here.

24:39.913 --> 24:42.176
Plenty of room inside,
as you will see...

24:43.482 --> 24:44.961
Uh, uh...

24:45.005 --> 24:46.310
Is that garbage?

24:46.354 --> 24:47.921
Just-just a little bit.

24:47.964 --> 24:50.227
I take the trash to
the dump myself to save money.

24:50.271 --> 24:52.273
But you know what?
It's fine.

24:52.316 --> 24:55.232
I can get rid of it.You-you can't leave
your trash here.

24:55.276 --> 24:58.453
Oh. Uh, no, no, no, no, no.
I-I will come back to get it

24:58.497 --> 25:00.063
after I dump the puppies.

25:00.107 --> 25:03.023
Drop off the puppies.
Drop off the puppies.

25:03.066 --> 25:05.547
Uh, I don't think,
uh, uh, Guiding Hope

25:05.591 --> 25:07.593
is the right fit for us.

25:08.594 --> 25:10.160
[forced chuckle]

25:10.204 --> 25:11.945
What?

25:11.988 --> 25:13.555
Okay, well...

25:13.599 --> 25:17.211
Don't-don't-don't
do that. Please.

25:17.254 --> 25:18.995
Uh, just
give me the...

25:19.039 --> 25:20.997
just give me
the puppies, huh?

25:21.041 --> 25:22.825
Wh-What if I... what if I
come back tomorrow, okay?

25:22.869 --> 25:24.958
Then can I have the puppies?I'm-I'm...

25:25.001 --> 25:27.569
Don't. No, don't-don't...
I-I just...I'm sorry.

25:27.613 --> 25:29.179
What do you think I'm gonna do,
strangle them?

25:29.223 --> 25:31.051
[chuckles]
I-I love puppies.

25:31.094 --> 25:32.966
Puppies love me.
Everybody...

25:33.009 --> 25:34.271
um...

25:35.621 --> 25:37.579
...knows that, so...

25:48.459 --> 25:50.897
Want to give me a hand?No.

25:50.940 --> 25:54.248
Yeah, don't forget to take
that down in your little notes.

26:00.123 --> 26:02.082
It's been, like, an hour.

26:02.125 --> 26:04.127
You're not... you're not gonna
offer us another beer?

26:04.171 --> 26:05.999
I bag groceries, so...

26:06.042 --> 26:08.001
can't just be giving out
free beer.

26:08.044 --> 26:09.480
Yeah.If I give you this,

26:09.524 --> 26:11.482
can I have another beer?

26:11.526 --> 26:12.658
[snickers]

26:12.701 --> 26:13.746
What?

26:14.790 --> 26:17.097
Nothing.

26:17.140 --> 26:18.185
Coming up.

26:18.228 --> 26:19.795
[quietly]:
Bitch.

26:19.839 --> 26:20.970
JESS: Murphy?MURPHY: What?

26:21.014 --> 26:23.277
I do not think Max
is coming back here,

26:23.320 --> 26:25.801
and I think we should go,
because I'm very uncomfortable.

26:25.845 --> 26:27.934
You're always uncomfortable.Well...

26:27.977 --> 26:30.197
Why haven't you
gotten used to it by now?

26:30.240 --> 26:32.329
JESS:
Thank you so much.

26:32.373 --> 26:34.549
What did you mean when
you said, "That tracks"?

26:34.593 --> 26:37.421
What's that?When I said
I was a friend of Max's,

26:37.465 --> 26:40.686
you said, "That tracks."
What does that mean?Well, you're hot,

26:40.729 --> 26:44.428
and, now I know,
maybe an alcoholic.

26:44.472 --> 26:46.213
I'm not an alc...
Um, what's the point?

26:46.256 --> 26:47.997
Well, it's kind of

26:48.041 --> 26:50.391
Max's thing:
wounded girls.

26:50.434 --> 26:52.828
Wow. We should go.I'm not wounded, either.

26:52.872 --> 26:54.525
More specifically,
addicts.

26:54.569 --> 26:56.310
It's 'cause of his mom,
you know?

26:56.353 --> 26:58.094
Hmm.Right.

26:58.138 --> 27:00.096
I knew her before
it happened.

27:00.140 --> 27:03.186
She was a drunk. Max was the
only one who tried to stop it.

27:03.230 --> 27:05.449
Everyone else just kept drinking
with her until she ended it.

27:05.493 --> 27:06.668
Yeah.

27:06.712 --> 27:09.323
It's, uh, it's
an awful story.

27:09.366 --> 27:11.891
Hmm. Well, I think
it always bothered Max

27:11.934 --> 27:14.284
that he couldn't fix her,
you know,

27:14.328 --> 27:15.764
before it was
too late.

27:18.158 --> 27:19.899
[whistles brief melody]

27:19.942 --> 27:21.335
[clears throat]

27:21.378 --> 27:23.337
Okay, honestly, guys,

27:23.380 --> 27:25.469
I don't think he's coming back.
He's probably crashing

27:25.513 --> 27:27.080
with someone else tonight.MURPHY:
Well, is there a place

27:27.123 --> 27:29.822
we can get some food
around here?The-the Rockpile.

27:29.865 --> 27:31.737
It's just down
the road.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.521
If I see him again,
I'll tell him you're there.

27:33.564 --> 27:35.305
Thank you so much.

27:42.399 --> 27:43.444
Murph, did you really know

27:43.487 --> 27:45.576
all that stuff
about Max's mom already?

27:45.620 --> 27:48.318
No.That's what I thought.

27:48.362 --> 27:51.452
Now we know why he's
such a disaster.

27:51.495 --> 27:52.714
[sighs]:
Oh, yeah. Seriously.

27:52.758 --> 27:54.585
Look, I know I'm supposed
to be all, like,

27:54.629 --> 27:56.936
"support all women"
or whatever, but...

27:56.979 --> 27:59.590
Jenny's a bitch.

27:59.634 --> 28:00.896
Like...

28:00.940 --> 28:02.898
[scoffs]
"Max dates addicts."

28:02.942 --> 28:04.987
Shut up. You don't
even know me.

28:05.031 --> 28:07.555
Yeah.Like, just 'cause we
dated the same guy

28:07.598 --> 28:09.122
doesn't mean you can
psychoanalyze me.

28:09.165 --> 28:11.646
Go away. She sucks.[groans]
I know.

Incoming call from Dork.

28:13.692 --> 28:16.520
[phone vibrating]Why is Felix calling me?

28:16.564 --> 28:18.479
Bourbon.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.047
What?

28:21.090 --> 28:23.136
You stole my van
and got me cut off!

28:23.179 --> 28:24.528
All my assets!

28:24.572 --> 28:26.748
I am toast. We all are.

28:26.792 --> 28:29.055
And guess what.
Do you realize that you have now

28:29.098 --> 28:32.319
taken away the one thing,
the one thing I have left?

28:32.362 --> 28:33.799
Well, Felix,
I'm sorry we took the van.

28:33.842 --> 28:34.800
No,

28:34.843 --> 28:36.758
Murphy, you're not sorry,

28:36.802 --> 28:38.499
because you revel
in my misfortune.

28:38.542 --> 28:41.328
My pain is like
a candy bar to you.

28:41.371 --> 28:43.025
My hurt is like

28:43.069 --> 28:45.071
a warm bath that you bathe in.

28:45.114 --> 28:46.463
Where are you?

28:46.507 --> 28:49.336
At some dump in Peoria.
