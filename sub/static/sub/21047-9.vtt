00:09.929 --> 00:12.564
<i>- Previously on "Blood Drive"...</i>
- Tell me about what you write

00:12.599 --> 00:13.799
in that little diary of yours.

00:13.834 --> 00:15.370
I got enough dirt here
to start a garden.

00:15.394 --> 00:18.035
<i>I just gotta figure out a way
to put all the pieces together.</i>

00:18.071 --> 00:20.638
I give you a lot of shit,
but you're the real deal.

00:20.678 --> 00:22.484
A fucking hero in blue.

00:22.527 --> 00:24.568
Remember Officer Aki?
I think she's kind of into me.

00:24.600 --> 00:25.934
Welcome to Heart.

00:25.969 --> 00:27.768
When my partner busts me out of here,

00:27.804 --> 00:30.104
we're gonna beat you
to a pile of bolts and wires.

00:30.140 --> 00:32.006
Arthur has a new partner now.

00:32.042 --> 00:34.442
So don't expect them to come rescue you.

00:34.477 --> 00:35.843
<i>Something's different.</i>

00:35.878 --> 00:37.677
<i>You're becoming human.</i>

00:37.713 --> 00:38.924
<i>This evidence was handed down to me</i>

00:38.948 --> 00:40.613
<i>by the best person I ever knew.</i>

00:40.649 --> 00:44.417
He made me promise
I'd pick up where he left off.

00:45.787 --> 00:48.455
Ain't no law without blood.

00:48.490 --> 00:50.357
You don't see that yet, but you will.

00:50.392 --> 00:51.725
You don't know me.

00:51.760 --> 00:55.527
I know why you carry
that goddamn diary around.

00:55.563 --> 01:00.900
I saw what you did to get it,
and I... see... you.

01:06.574 --> 01:08.807
Terry says there's
a doctor in the next town.

01:08.843 --> 01:10.141
<i>You're gonna be okay.</i>

01:32.098 --> 01:34.865
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

01:43.108 --> 01:44.507
What the fuck?

01:57.789 --> 02:00.755
What the hell?

02:15.973 --> 02:18.672
Barbie, you're not gonna believe this.

02:18.707 --> 02:21.442
Come on, Barbie. Don't quit on me now.

02:21.477 --> 02:22.543
Come on.

02:25.815 --> 02:27.781
We need help, or a phone.

02:27.817 --> 02:29.116
Or if anyone's a doctor,

02:29.152 --> 02:30.784
that'd be really clutch right about now.

02:30.820 --> 02:32.786
Welcome to Tasty Dragon.

02:32.822 --> 02:33.954
Table for two?

02:33.989 --> 02:35.688
No, ma'am, we need a doctor.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.223
We can stitch him up.

02:37.259 --> 02:39.625
But you have to order something first.

02:39.661 --> 02:40.893
Are you shitting me?

02:40.929 --> 02:42.462
Jesus Christ.

02:42.497 --> 02:43.896
Just take that and call it even.

02:43.932 --> 02:46.499
You have to order something.

02:46.534 --> 02:47.900
Fine, I'll just do it myself.

02:47.936 --> 02:49.169
If I break the rules for you,

02:49.204 --> 02:50.804
I have to break the rules for everybody.

02:50.839 --> 02:53.738
Fine, fine, then
just give us the special, okay?

02:56.110 --> 02:58.210
I worked hard on this soup.

02:58.245 --> 03:00.245
The least he can do is taste it.

03:00.281 --> 03:02.147
Nononononono. Nononono.

03:05.186 --> 03:07.152
Arthur?

03:22.802 --> 03:24.802
Where the hell am I?

03:48.259 --> 03:50.526
Am I dead?

03:51.896 --> 03:53.195
That's up to you.

04:11.281 --> 04:14.115
If I'm not dead, then where am I?

04:14.151 --> 04:15.917
People call it lots of things.

04:15.952 --> 04:17.918
A vision quest,

04:17.952 --> 04:19.886
dark night of the soul,

04:19.922 --> 04:22.256
tripping balls.

04:22.291 --> 04:24.591
I prefer to call it dreaming.

04:24.626 --> 04:27.727
If that's true, then why are you here?

04:27.763 --> 04:29.930
And where's Christopher?
I heard you two are pals now.

04:29.965 --> 04:31.798
Christopher's fine.

04:31.833 --> 04:36.735
In real life, he's with his.

04:37.805 --> 04:39.838
What was that?

04:39.874 --> 04:40.906
What was what?

04:40.942 --> 04:43.176
That beeping?

04:43.211 --> 04:45.844
This is your dream, Arthur.

04:45.880 --> 04:49.782
I'm a creation from your own brain.

04:55.122 --> 04:58.590
If you don't know
what's happening to Christopher,

04:58.625 --> 04:59.924
then how could I?

04:59.960 --> 05:01.126
So none of this is real?

05:01.161 --> 05:02.294
I said this was a dream.

05:02.329 --> 05:05.363
I didn't say it wasn't real.

05:05.399 --> 05:07.364
Okay, so let me guess,
you're supposed to

05:07.400 --> 05:10.267
guide me through this.

05:10.303 --> 05:12.035
Well, thanks, but no thanks.

05:12.071 --> 05:14.638
Hey, I know this is freaky,

05:14.673 --> 05:16.974
but you're a cop.

05:17.009 --> 05:19.009
How do I know I can trust you?

05:20.813 --> 05:22.379
I am you.

05:22.415 --> 05:25.215
Is there some reason
you can't trust yourself?

05:28.386 --> 05:30.220
Hey.

05:30.255 --> 05:32.155
You still with me, handsome?

05:32.190 --> 05:34.957
You're not gonna
leave me alone, are you?

05:34.993 --> 05:38.128
Probably not.

05:42.399 --> 05:43.798
What are you doing?

05:46.437 --> 05:48.337
Follow me.

06:04.020 --> 06:05.419
Sencha green tea.

06:05.455 --> 06:07.054
Calms the nerves.

06:07.089 --> 06:09.089
Lady, quit the Chingchong bullshit.

06:09.125 --> 06:11.759
Could you be
10% less Chinese for a second

06:11.794 --> 06:13.161
and help me stitch up my friend?

06:13.196 --> 06:15.262
Well, that's not offensive at all.

06:15.297 --> 06:16.996
You white people

06:17.032 --> 06:19.199
come in here...

06:19.234 --> 06:23.836
expecting a show, a mystic
experience of the East,

06:23.872 --> 06:26.773
and "Chingchong bullshit"
rakes in the tips.

06:26.808 --> 06:28.085
Well, maybe I'd be more sensitive

06:28.109 --> 06:30.076
if my friend weren't bleeding to death.

06:30.111 --> 06:31.411
We should have never come here.

06:31.446 --> 06:33.879
You could drive for miles
in every direction

06:33.914 --> 06:35.725
and your friend will be dead
before you get anywhere.

06:35.749 --> 06:37.883
Okay, well, then stop wasting my time.

06:37.918 --> 06:40.886
Help him, please.

06:40.921 --> 06:45.224
We'll need more towels
from the dining room.

06:45.259 --> 06:47.259
Hope blood doesn't make you squeamish.

07:06.812 --> 07:08.778
What the hell?

07:16.988 --> 07:18.922
What the hell did you do to Arthur?

07:18.957 --> 07:20.490
I'm trying to help him.

07:20.526 --> 07:22.125
The fuck you are.

07:22.160 --> 07:23.459
Look, I don't want to hurt you.

07:24.495 --> 07:25.861
But you fix him right now,

07:25.896 --> 07:27.830
or this knife is going in your throat.

07:27.865 --> 07:30.032
No, it won't, Grace.

07:31.469 --> 07:33.102
That's not who you are anymore.

07:35.873 --> 07:37.551
What was that you were saying
about stereotypes again?

07:37.575 --> 07:39.875
This used to be Springfield, Missouri,

07:39.910 --> 07:41.509
the whitest city in America.

07:41.545 --> 07:44.812
Asian girl's gotta know
how to defend herself.

07:58.227 --> 07:59.960
This would be so much easier

07:59.995 --> 08:01.228
if you'd only listen.

08:09.171 --> 08:12.506
You must have been a real
pantydropper with this whole

08:12.541 --> 08:15.975
strong, silent type routine.

08:16.010 --> 08:19.078
This is the first layer
of your subconscious.

08:19.113 --> 08:22.315
But you could call it your happy place.

08:22.350 --> 08:23.849
Seems kind of boring.

08:23.885 --> 08:26.586
Happiness usually is.

08:26.621 --> 08:28.988
So almighty spirit guide,
what great truths

08:29.023 --> 08:30.990
will I be learning about myself today?

08:31.025 --> 08:33.258
It's my job to help you find the key

08:33.294 --> 08:34.826
to get out of this dream.

08:34.861 --> 08:35.994
Anything else you learn

08:36.029 --> 08:37.596
along the way is up to you.

08:37.631 --> 08:40.332
But your brain plays tricks on you.

08:40.366 --> 08:43.268
So consider yourself warned.

08:43.304 --> 08:45.437
Can I go anywhere?

08:45.472 --> 08:49.072
Your journey, your choice.

09:06.224 --> 09:08.191
Hey!

09:08.226 --> 09:09.526
That's not where we need to go!

09:09.561 --> 09:11.928
My journey, my choice, right?

09:20.972 --> 09:22.205
Arthur?

09:22.240 --> 09:24.206
You don't have to knock.

09:24.241 --> 09:26.107
Did you forget your keys?

09:26.143 --> 09:28.243
Wait, Arthur! We can't go...

09:41.198 --> 09:43.098
Is this our house?

09:43.594 --> 09:45.594
Of course it's our house, silly.

09:45.768 --> 09:48.198
And somebody's been missing you all day.

09:50.538 --> 09:52.071
I...

09:52.264 --> 09:53.858
we have a baby?

09:53.900 --> 09:54.933
Shh...

09:54.968 --> 09:56.000
How did this happen?

09:57.470 --> 09:58.747
Now, I don't really have to explain

09:58.771 --> 10:01.172
the birds and the bees to you, do I?

10:01.207 --> 10:03.123
The birds and the...

10:07.925 --> 10:10.458
He's beautiful.

10:10.494 --> 10:11.793
I've given it a lot of thought,

10:11.828 --> 10:13.728
and I know you wanted
to name him Harrison

10:13.764 --> 10:16.198
after your grandfather, but...

10:16.233 --> 10:19.034
I think he looks a lot more
like a Ribbone, don't you?

10:20.076 --> 10:21.402
Rib...

10:21.437 --> 10:22.403
wha... what?

10:22.438 --> 10:24.005
Ribbone?

10:24.040 --> 10:26.207
Why would you name our son
after that psycho?

10:26.242 --> 10:28.142
What... why not James

10:28.177 --> 10:29.743
or Danny? I mean...

10:30.947 --> 10:33.047
It reminds me of when we first met.

10:35.618 --> 10:36.918
Jeez.

10:36.953 --> 10:38.551
Now we'll never get you out of here.

10:38.586 --> 10:40.820
You need to focus.

10:40.855 --> 10:42.055
Is this my future?

10:42.090 --> 10:43.589
Yeah.

10:43.625 --> 10:48.094
If you're into the whole baby thing.

10:48.130 --> 10:50.063
We need to go.

10:50.098 --> 10:51.098
Why?

10:52.134 --> 10:53.566
Because of him.

11:01.475 --> 11:03.108
Who the hell is that?

11:06.880 --> 11:08.747
Sweetheart, would you mind
putting the baby

11:08.782 --> 11:10.449
in the garbage disposal, please?

11:12.785 --> 11:14.953
What did you just say?

11:14.988 --> 11:18.089
How else are we gonna fuel the house?

11:23.896 --> 11:26.597
The house runs on blood?

11:26.632 --> 11:29.799
Everything runs on blood.

11:29.835 --> 11:31.634
Just give her the baby.

11:31.670 --> 11:32.902
No, sh...

11:32.938 --> 11:34.571
I won't let you kill our son.

11:34.606 --> 11:36.974
Arthur Bailey, I'm gonna count to three.

11:37.009 --> 11:39.242
I don't care if you count
to a fucking billion, bitch.

11:39.278 --> 11:40.944
You're gonna give me that baby.

11:40.980 --> 11:43.220
I am not gonna give you the
baby... get your hands off...

11:48.519 --> 11:49.651
What the hell?

11:49.687 --> 11:50.831
This could have been your future,

11:50.855 --> 11:52.788
but you don't think you deserve it,

11:52.823 --> 11:54.623
so it's falling apart.

12:03.700 --> 12:05.900
Holy shit...

12:12.642 --> 12:13.774
God.

12:13.810 --> 12:16.744
You're such a misogynist cliché.

12:16.779 --> 12:19.680
Chicks are either
the Madonna or the whore to you.

12:21.050 --> 12:22.649
I'm objectifying her?

12:26.022 --> 12:27.521
Dude, trust me,

12:27.556 --> 12:29.656
the key is not in her coin slot.

12:29.691 --> 12:31.825
Maybe objectification isn't so bad.

12:31.860 --> 12:33.627
- We have to go.
- Just...

12:33.662 --> 12:35.329
- Now.
- I don't want to go.

12:35.364 --> 12:36.596
You go.

12:44.672 --> 12:47.206
God, no.

12:47.242 --> 12:48.807
Nonono, please, please, don't shoot.

12:48.843 --> 12:50.709
Please...

12:50.745 --> 12:52.211
God.

12:52.247 --> 12:54.046
God, Grace, Grace.

12:54.081 --> 12:55.047
Grace!

12:55.082 --> 12:57.182
- Grace.
- Come with me!

12:57.217 --> 12:58.883
You didn't say this was a nightmare!

12:58.919 --> 13:01.119
You neglected to tell me
how much baggage you have.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.820
Now come with me.

13:06.226 --> 13:09.027
You said this was a dream.
Why does this actually hurt?

13:09.063 --> 13:11.062
Because this isn't any normal dream.

13:11.097 --> 13:14.065
If you die here, you die in real life.

13:21.407 --> 13:24.141
What just happened? Did Grace just die?

13:24.177 --> 13:27.044
It's not her dream, so no, relax.

13:29.281 --> 13:31.214
- That's good.
- No, it's not good!

13:31.249 --> 13:33.349
The prick with the gun won't stop until

13:33.385 --> 13:35.651
he destroys you from the inside out.

13:45.629 --> 13:47.762
Saw this number on the mailboxes.

13:49.133 --> 13:51.333
1031.

13:51.368 --> 13:53.268
Must really mean something to you.

13:53.304 --> 13:55.937
When you wake up, you should
play those lotto numbers.

13:55.973 --> 13:58.773
The universe might be trying
to give you a little gift.

14:03.980 --> 14:07.848
Thanks for taking that bullet for me.

14:07.883 --> 14:10.351
You're my hero.

14:10.386 --> 14:12.920
Yeah, well... it was no big deal.

14:14.224 --> 14:17.024
Especially since
I didn't take it for you.

14:21.830 --> 14:23.263
Jessica!

14:23.298 --> 14:25.398
My pet fish from when I was a kid!

14:27.269 --> 14:31.238
Memories, emotions, phobias...
that sort of thing.

14:31.273 --> 14:35.308
Inside one of these memories
is the key to get you out.

14:55.695 --> 14:59.664
Look what I found!

15:21.520 --> 15:24.788
You're quite the fighter.

15:24.823 --> 15:27.190
It's kept you alive all these years.

15:27.225 --> 15:30.793
Here, it'll just make you tired.

15:33.498 --> 15:37.500
You still think
you came here by accident.

15:37.535 --> 15:39.835
We had no choice.

15:39.870 --> 15:41.215
Your joint's the only thing standing

15:41.239 --> 15:43.138
in this godforsaken desert.

15:43.174 --> 15:45.807
Which doesn't make any sense
because we're by the Scar,

15:45.842 --> 15:47.509
and nothing's supposed to work here.

15:47.544 --> 15:49.344
I provide a sacred space

15:49.379 --> 15:51.379
for travelers to find their path.

15:51.415 --> 15:54.849
Your friend and his demons
are here to make things right.

15:54.884 --> 15:57.985
Just like everyone else who comes here.

15:58.021 --> 15:59.153
Yeah?

15:59.189 --> 16:02.022
How many of them get happy endings?

16:02.057 --> 16:03.957
Most.

16:03.992 --> 16:05.892
But not all.

16:05.928 --> 16:08.061
Those the herbs you're using on Arthur?

16:10.165 --> 16:12.032
They're not herbs.

16:12.067 --> 16:13.500
They're remains...

16:13.536 --> 16:16.970
travelers who didn't
survive their quest.

16:18.940 --> 16:21.374
Looks like you're
pretty shitty at your job.

16:21.409 --> 16:24.310
Not everyone who comes here
survives their quest,

16:24.346 --> 16:25.978
just like in life.

16:26.013 --> 16:29.215
Why should a dream be any different?

16:29.251 --> 16:31.262
Lady, it looks like you've
been drinking your own soup,

16:31.286 --> 16:33.052
'cause we're not on any quest.

16:33.087 --> 16:35.920
We're your fucking prisoners.

16:35.956 --> 16:37.389
There is no greater prison

16:37.424 --> 16:40.892
than the one in which we trap ourselves.

16:40.927 --> 16:44.195
Besides, who said you were my prisoner?

17:33.528 --> 17:35.329
You can't go back the way you came.

17:35.364 --> 17:37.931
You can only move forward.

17:37.966 --> 17:40.667
Welcome to the second layer
of your subconscious.

17:40.714 --> 17:44.641
This is where things
start to get interesting.

17:44.676 --> 17:45.808
Great.

17:52.683 --> 17:55.884
You want to tell me what
I'm supposed to be looking for?

18:00.424 --> 18:02.491
Pixie Swallow? Are you serious?

18:02.526 --> 18:05.393
Why would the key be there?

18:05.428 --> 18:08.296
It's your brain, not mine.

18:11.801 --> 18:14.402
So the key is somewhere inside there.

18:14.437 --> 18:16.737
But first we have to sneak past them

18:16.773 --> 18:18.706
without getting killed.

18:18.741 --> 18:20.741
They look pretty harmless.

18:20.777 --> 18:22.409
Now they do.

18:22.444 --> 18:24.778
But if you disturb them in any way,

18:24.813 --> 18:26.579
they will wake up

18:26.615 --> 18:29.282
and come after you with a vengeance.

18:29.318 --> 18:31.418
Of course Grace is Mary Magdalene.

18:31.453 --> 18:33.687
And why is Ribbone a rabbi?

18:33.722 --> 18:36.523
Not everything has to mean something.

18:36.558 --> 18:39.758
Why is Clowndick
wearing a cocktail dress?

18:39.794 --> 18:41.460
Can we go another way?

18:41.495 --> 18:42.695
No.

18:42.730 --> 18:46.064
Da Vinci or Dark Horseman?

18:46.099 --> 18:48.801
Your choice.

18:59.612 --> 19:02.814
I'm no doctor, but that
does not look like it's working.

19:02.849 --> 19:05.783
Eastern medicine, Western medicine...

19:05.819 --> 19:07.885
so much depends on him.

19:07.920 --> 19:10.921
He's got to find his own way.

19:10.957 --> 19:13.457
We try to control our lives,

19:13.492 --> 19:16.526
but the world always has the final say.

19:22.835 --> 19:27.404
This was my life, before the Scar.

19:27.439 --> 19:30.105
One day I was printing menus,

19:30.140 --> 19:33.075
the next, the ground had opened up

19:33.110 --> 19:36.512
and swallowed up my entire world,

19:36.547 --> 19:39.415
including my daughter

19:39.450 --> 19:41.650
and her damn cat.

19:46.023 --> 19:47.955
Why not just leave?

19:47.991 --> 19:51.659
I'm bound to this restaurant.

19:51.695 --> 19:53.661
Why not just create
a dreamworld for yourself

19:53.697 --> 19:56.498
where your daughter's still alive?

19:56.533 --> 19:58.666
Doesn't work that way.

19:58.702 --> 20:00.835
There are limits.

20:00.871 --> 20:04.872
The Scar likes things
done a certain way.

20:04.907 --> 20:06.540
How can the Scar like anything?

20:06.575 --> 20:08.642
It's just a crack in the earth.

20:12.748 --> 20:15.682
I'm sorry, there's just
too many bone fragments.

20:15.718 --> 20:17.551
- What?
- I can't get them all out.

20:17.586 --> 20:19.553
You should prepare to say goodbye.

20:19.588 --> 20:21.153
No, you don't know him like I do.

20:21.188 --> 20:23.689
He's not just gonna give up. Try again.

20:23.725 --> 20:25.391
I'm sorry.

20:25.427 --> 20:28.728
Sometimes that's the way
the fortune cookie crumbles.

20:28.763 --> 20:31.564
He's beyond my abilities.
He's too far gone.

20:31.599 --> 20:33.365
I'm not gonna lose you too.

20:33.401 --> 20:35.835
If you won't do it, I will.

20:50.751 --> 20:52.717
Hey.

20:52.753 --> 20:54.385
Hey.

20:54.421 --> 20:55.719
Is this the key?

21:38.562 --> 21:39.928
Arthur, hurry!

21:52.108 --> 21:56.076
Hurry... before the chef comes back.

21:56.112 --> 21:58.078
Okay.

21:58.114 --> 21:59.814
Hold on...

21:59.849 --> 22:01.716
Just... sit tight.

22:01.751 --> 22:02.949
Why can't I...

22:02.985 --> 22:04.918
Why can't I get this free?

22:10.659 --> 22:12.626
Okay. Hold on.

22:12.661 --> 22:13.727
Just a second.

22:22.003 --> 22:23.502
They're all fucking dull!

22:23.538 --> 22:25.470
Hey, hey, it's okay.

22:25.506 --> 22:28.273
You tried. Take the key and go.

22:28.308 --> 22:29.909
- I won't leave you.
- You have to.

22:29.944 --> 22:32.144
No, no. I'm gonna save you.

22:32.179 --> 22:33.946
You're gonna be fine, I promise.

22:35.182 --> 22:38.149
Just...

22:39.619 --> 22:41.853
Fuck. God!

22:41.888 --> 22:43.621
Fucking come on!

23:02.240 --> 23:04.541
Buddy.

23:04.577 --> 23:06.543
I'm so glad to see you, man.

23:06.579 --> 23:09.179
Not for long, dude.

23:09.214 --> 23:10.980
What?

23:11.015 --> 23:12.548
You want to suffer.

23:12.584 --> 23:13.883
No, I don't.

23:13.918 --> 23:16.619
And I'm here to grant your wish.

23:16.654 --> 23:19.564
What are you talking about?

23:33.349 --> 23:35.183
Sorry.

23:35.219 --> 23:38.320
This bullet is just so damn

23:38.355 --> 23:40.455
stubborn.

23:40.759 --> 23:42.726
Using your whole fist?

23:45.669 --> 23:48.813
That's a great idea.

23:48.971 --> 23:50.771
Nono. No, no, no!

23:53.809 --> 23:55.643
What's that?

23:55.678 --> 23:57.718
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you
with all the yelping.

23:57.747 --> 23:59.813
You've always been such a whiny fucker.

23:59.849 --> 24:03.751
I thought we were partners.
Why are you doing this, man?

24:03.786 --> 24:04.997
Because he's not the real Christopher.

24:05.021 --> 24:07.554
He's the version in your head.

24:07.589 --> 24:11.703
You must feel guilty
for leaving him behind.

24:13.179 --> 24:15.247
You're not still mad, are ya?

24:15.299 --> 24:18.000
I didn't shoot ya, make you wander off

24:18.035 --> 24:20.102
into the Scar, halfdead.

24:20.137 --> 24:21.436
You're such a piece of shit.

24:21.472 --> 24:23.204
Now, now, don't get your blood up.

24:23.239 --> 24:26.107
It'll spoil the meat.

24:26.142 --> 24:27.441
Look, I get it.

24:27.477 --> 24:29.510
You're pissed.

24:29.545 --> 24:31.512
But I only did what
I had to do to survive.

24:31.547 --> 24:33.915
When I was stuck in that
Heart Enterprise hellhole

24:33.950 --> 24:35.950
and you were out there
fucking and killing

24:35.986 --> 24:37.451
and fucking some more?

24:37.487 --> 24:38.452
That's what you call survival?

24:38.488 --> 24:39.952
Nononononol...

24:39.977 --> 24:41.731
I only fucked her so
my head wouldn't explode!

24:41.755 --> 24:43.055
That's what they all say!

24:43.080 --> 24:44.762
You would have done the same
thing if you were there!

24:44.786 --> 24:46.431
Excuse me, I'm sorry,
I don't mean to interrupt

24:46.455 --> 24:49.288
this beautiful "broment,"
but there's so much

24:49.313 --> 24:50.880
pain and suffering to do

24:50.914 --> 24:52.215
and so little time to do it.

24:56.808 --> 24:58.708
- No...
- I'm happy we're doing this

24:58.733 --> 25:00.500
- together.
- No. Christopher, no.

25:00.535 --> 25:02.968
Because the only thing better
than being inside of you,

25:03.004 --> 25:05.350
is knowing I get to eat you afterword.

25:20.854 --> 25:22.720
It's not the first time
you did this, is it?

25:22.756 --> 25:24.388
No.

25:24.424 --> 25:26.057
I did it once before.

25:26.092 --> 25:29.327
On my daughter, Aki.

25:29.362 --> 25:33.129
I can only imagine how much
she meant to you. I'm sorry.

25:35.167 --> 25:37.133
Thank you for helping us.

25:45.110 --> 25:46.977
Is this some kind of a joke?

25:47.012 --> 25:49.111
Like I said,

25:49.146 --> 25:51.246
your friend isn't
the only one on a quest.

25:51.282 --> 25:52.915
Enough of the mystical bullshit.

25:52.951 --> 25:55.184
How do you have this?
How do you even know about Karma?

25:55.219 --> 25:57.353
I know everything about you.

25:57.388 --> 25:58.855
I know you blame yourself

25:58.890 --> 26:00.790
because you couldn't save your sister.

26:00.825 --> 26:02.792
I know you refuse
to let go of your friend,

26:02.827 --> 26:04.360
even though he's clearly dying.

26:04.395 --> 26:09.097
And I didn't need the Scar
to tell me that.

26:09.132 --> 26:10.966
You don't know shit.

26:11.001 --> 26:12.467
Yeah?

26:12.503 --> 26:14.102
Let's see.

26:21.344 --> 26:23.210
First, you try
pretending you don't care.

26:23.245 --> 26:25.045
But that never works.

26:25.080 --> 26:27.882
Now it seems you care too much.

26:27.917 --> 26:30.017
At some point,

26:30.052 --> 26:31.218
you have to accept that

26:31.253 --> 26:33.487
it doesn't matter what you care about.

26:33.523 --> 26:34.955
Shit happens.

26:34.991 --> 26:38.392
There's nothing you can do to stop it.

26:38.427 --> 26:40.292
Somewhere in there, Grace,

26:40.328 --> 26:43.229
you have to let go.

26:54.175 --> 26:56.408
God damn it.

26:56.443 --> 26:58.410
You know, we better
serve the first course soon

26:58.445 --> 27:00.089
or our guests here
are gonna help themselves

27:00.113 --> 27:01.747
to some Arthur tartare.

27:03.283 --> 27:05.083
I don't work well under pressure.

27:05.118 --> 27:06.818
Can't we just get this over with?

27:06.854 --> 27:09.821
No, no, there's no
"get this over with" here!

27:09.857 --> 27:12.390
We're preparing a Promethean feast

27:12.426 --> 27:16.027
with you as the main course.

27:16.062 --> 27:17.361
Promethean what?

27:18.464 --> 27:19.931
We're gonna butcher you up,

27:19.966 --> 27:21.766
then we're gonna devour you.

27:21.801 --> 27:23.834
And after we eat you,
we're gonna digest you

27:23.870 --> 27:25.169
and shit you out our backside.

27:25.204 --> 27:27.572
But, you, see, you're gonna heal up

27:27.607 --> 27:31.441
all good as new so that we
get to eat you again tomorrow.

27:31.476 --> 27:33.043
And the next day.

27:33.078 --> 27:36.379
And the day after that
and the day after that,

27:36.414 --> 27:40.416
leaving you with
an eternity to contemplate

27:40.452 --> 27:42.385
your regrets.

27:42.420 --> 27:45.421
And to think all of this

27:45.457 --> 27:46.589
came out of your boring

27:46.624 --> 27:49.858
little Boy Scout brain.

27:49.894 --> 27:52.394
Actually, I have to say, I'm...

27:52.429 --> 27:54.897
I'm quite jealous.

27:54.932 --> 27:57.900
So all this is just a bunch of bullshit?

27:57.935 --> 27:59.101
Including the key?

27:59.136 --> 28:01.403
No, the key was real.

28:01.438 --> 28:04.271
And it means everything.

28:04.307 --> 28:06.474
But I actually never
wanted you to find it.

28:11.615 --> 28:13.380
That's my cue.

28:14.985 --> 28:16.317
Shit.

28:16.352 --> 28:18.252
Didn't expect him that quick.

29:01.995 --> 29:04.996
As much as I enjoy a good gunfight,

29:05.032 --> 29:08.033
what do you say we
flip for Arthur's soul?

29:08.068 --> 29:11.469
Like gentlemen.
I'll even let you call it.

29:18.510 --> 29:20.144
Fuck me.

29:32.590 --> 29:35.357
I see you, Arthur Bailey.

29:43.101 --> 29:45.634
There's no place I can't find you.

30:03.086 --> 30:05.086
If you got something to say,

30:05.121 --> 30:07.722
say it.

30:14.630 --> 30:17.264
Wait, I thought we were gonna talk.

30:17.299 --> 30:19.366
You've talked enough.

30:21.737 --> 30:25.438
It's time to listen.

30:25.473 --> 30:26.940
No, no.

30:26.975 --> 30:28.341
Nonononono!

30:29.377 --> 30:31.244
Arthur.

30:34.216 --> 30:36.716
No. No, you don't have to...

30:36.751 --> 30:38.117
you don't have to do this.

31:14.499 --> 31:16.733
You don't have to do this.

31:16.769 --> 31:18.301
I'm sorry.

31:18.336 --> 31:20.237
I'll be good, I promise. I'll be good.

31:20.272 --> 31:22.806
I'll be good. I'll be good.

31:22.841 --> 31:25.575
Haven't you figured it out yet?

31:33.517 --> 31:35.384
There are no good guys.

32:03.345 --> 32:05.279
<i>Remember the first heat wave?</i>

32:05.314 --> 32:07.181
Summer after the fracking quake?

32:07.216 --> 32:09.316
This whole city was rioting.

32:09.351 --> 32:10.695
I broke into a public storage unit,

32:10.719 --> 32:12.585
trying to steal some food.

32:12.621 --> 32:14.521
I got caught by a cop.

32:14.556 --> 32:16.389
That guy still on the force?

32:39.579 --> 32:40.579
Hold it right there.

32:41.648 --> 32:43.448
LAPD! Hold your fire!

32:43.483 --> 32:45.350
LAPD ain't even in control anymore!

32:45.385 --> 32:48.553
Yeah? Well, you sure ain't.

32:48.588 --> 32:50.822
And you are in the wrong place.

32:50.857 --> 32:54.959
Throw the gun out along the floor.

32:57.830 --> 33:01.631
All right, come out of there.
Nice and easy.

33:01.667 --> 33:05.035
No sudden moves.

33:05.071 --> 33:08.304
Come on, kid, what
the hell are you doing?

33:08.340 --> 33:10.373
Wait a minute.

33:10.408 --> 33:12.008
You one of those demos?

33:12.043 --> 33:13.343
Demo what?

33:13.378 --> 33:15.879
What color do you bleed?

33:23.021 --> 33:25.387
You make one more move,

33:25.422 --> 33:27.589
and I will blow the wires
right out of your head.

33:29.927 --> 33:32.361
Who sent you?

33:32.396 --> 33:35.430
Are you fucking crazy, man?

33:35.465 --> 33:36.932
I just came in for supplies.

33:36.967 --> 33:39.501
Check my bag, I swear.

33:50.380 --> 33:52.579
My God.

33:52.615 --> 33:55.682
I really thought you were a...

33:55.718 --> 33:59.286
But you are just some dumb-ass burglar.

33:59.321 --> 34:02.389
<i>Sutherland,
what's the status on that 1070?</i>

34:02.424 --> 34:03.924
<i>Should we send backup?</i>

34:03.959 --> 34:05.569
No, hey, I'm sorry
I took all that stuff, man.

34:05.593 --> 34:06.804
I'm sorry I took all that stuff.

34:06.828 --> 34:09.029
I... I... just...
I was just trying to eat.

34:15.157 --> 34:17.458
Roger, I'm 10106 here.

34:17.972 --> 34:19.804
False alarm.

34:20.022 --> 34:21.940
Looks like a rat
broke into the storage room

34:21.976 --> 34:23.309
and chewed through some wires.

34:25.679 --> 34:28.480
You're letting me go?

34:28.514 --> 34:30.748
Yeah. I'm letting you go.

34:30.784 --> 34:32.384
Thank you.

34:32.420 --> 34:33.562
Thank you, man. I won't say shit, man.

34:33.585 --> 34:35.453
I swear. Thank you.

34:35.487 --> 34:36.487
Wait.

34:41.094 --> 34:42.493
You forgot something.

34:46.833 --> 34:49.699
Come on. Take it.

34:57.876 --> 35:01.127
I know you're just
trying to survive, kid.

35:02.547 --> 35:05.115
But if you think that world
is bad out there now,

35:05.373 --> 35:08.765
it's about to get a whole lot worse.

35:09.020 --> 35:11.646
So you gotta stop being stupid.

35:11.812 --> 35:13.622
Stop being selfish.

35:13.657 --> 35:15.358
You gotta start caring

35:15.393 --> 35:19.128
about something bigger than yourself.

35:19.163 --> 35:23.699
You understand me?

35:23.734 --> 35:25.433
Now get the hell out of here.

35:31.741 --> 35:33.541
Shit.

35:33.576 --> 35:34.876
Shit, shit.

35:34.911 --> 35:36.177
Jesus...

35:36.213 --> 35:38.546
Shit. God.

35:38.581 --> 35:40.781
What the fuck?

35:40.817 --> 35:43.884
God.

35:43.919 --> 35:45.019
What do I do?

35:45.054 --> 35:46.720
I can't believe it.

35:46.755 --> 35:48.989
I got killed by a Backstreet Boy.

35:49.025 --> 35:50.790
Who?

35:50.826 --> 35:52.792
You're not gonna die, man.
I'm not gonna let you.

35:52.828 --> 35:55.062
Fuck.

35:55.097 --> 35:56.963
Okay, fuck.

35:58.533 --> 36:00.500
Sorrysorrysorry.

36:00.535 --> 36:02.013
Why didn't you tell me
you were hurt, man?

36:02.037 --> 36:04.904
I would have tried to help you.

36:04.939 --> 36:07.706
God, there's so much blood.

36:07.742 --> 36:09.909
You gotta call
the paramedics on your radio.

36:09.944 --> 36:12.078
Kid.

36:12.113 --> 36:14.914
ContraCrime might have
just bought the LAPD...

36:14.949 --> 36:17.049
they took over the hospitals years ago.

36:17.084 --> 36:20.885
Do I look like I can
afford an ambulance?

36:20.921 --> 36:23.221
God damn it, this is so fucked up.

36:23.257 --> 36:24.923
I can't... I can't...

36:24.958 --> 36:26.691
I can't stop the bleeding.
It's too much.

36:26.726 --> 36:28.093
- Relax, kid.
- Fuck.

36:28.128 --> 36:29.928
You're not the one who's dying.

36:29.963 --> 36:31.863
But it was my fault.

36:31.898 --> 36:33.697
Can't argue with that.

36:33.732 --> 36:37.034
Kid,

36:37.070 --> 36:40.771
you want to make this right?

36:45.178 --> 36:47.278
Here.

36:47.313 --> 36:50.813
Take this.

36:50.848 --> 36:52.048
Are you... you want me...

36:52.084 --> 36:53.649
you want me to give this to somebody?

36:53.685 --> 36:57.087
Nah, there's nobody to give it to.

36:57.122 --> 37:00.223
Nobody'd ever believed me.

37:00.258 --> 37:02.125
There's somebody behind
all of this crazy shit

37:02.160 --> 37:04.660
that I was talking about before.

37:04.696 --> 37:07.096
But I just don't know who.

37:07.131 --> 37:11.233
But everything I do know

37:11.268 --> 37:14.936
is in that book.

37:14.972 --> 37:17.172
I don't expect you to believe it.

37:17.208 --> 37:21.221
Didn't believe it myself
when I first found out.

37:22.179 --> 37:24.436
But if you do believe it,

37:25.014 --> 37:27.227
don't ignore it.

37:27.433 --> 37:29.338
Okay.

37:30.153 --> 37:31.973
I'll do...

37:32.314 --> 37:35.410
I'll do whatever you want.

37:35.891 --> 37:37.925
That book is the only
shred of evidence I have

37:37.960 --> 37:40.027
I did anything worthwhile with my life.

37:42.231 --> 37:43.696
<i>Sutherland, you copy?</i>

37:45.367 --> 37:48.034
<i>Sutherland, where are you?
We're on the way.</i>

37:48.069 --> 37:51.273
- Kid, you gotta go.
- No, no, no...

37:51.298 --> 37:52.654
They'll never believe
this was an accident.

37:52.678 --> 37:54.439
- I can't do it.
- You gotta go.

37:54.464 --> 37:56.063
- I can't, no.
- You gotta go.

37:56.088 --> 37:57.719
<i>Sutherland, we're sending backup.</i>

37:57.744 --> 38:00.547
The world still needs heroes.

38:01.753 --> 38:04.521
Now go.

38:32.561 --> 38:34.625
I tried my best.

38:51.310 --> 38:53.831
I did everything I could.

38:54.474 --> 38:56.680
There's only one cop left to kill.

39:18.241 --> 39:20.006
It's gotta be you, kid.

39:22.177 --> 39:24.878
You're the only one
who can make this right.

39:57.444 --> 40:00.077
Arthur.

40:00.113 --> 40:01.846
Shit.

40:01.882 --> 40:03.147
Don't quit on me now.

40:03.182 --> 40:04.816
Your friend is dying.

40:04.851 --> 40:06.851
Well, then do something.

40:06.887 --> 40:08.720
You can't change his fate.

40:08.755 --> 40:10.321
I don't believe in fate.

40:12.892 --> 40:15.225
His pressure's dropping.

40:17.062 --> 40:18.695
He's lost too much blood.

40:18.731 --> 40:20.731
Come on. Come on, Arthur.

40:20.766 --> 40:22.165
Arthur.

40:22.200 --> 40:24.435
He needs more blood than you can give.

40:24.470 --> 40:25.869
Are you prepared to die?

40:25.905 --> 40:27.070
What do you think?

40:31.476 --> 40:33.275
Come on, Arthur.

40:51.462 --> 40:52.861
Arthur?

40:55.432 --> 40:57.065
You gotta be shitting me.

40:57.100 --> 41:00.068
You billed me for this shit?

41:17.453 --> 41:20.186
Shit.

41:22.591 --> 41:25.558
Arthur!

42:14.219 --> 42:16.486
Fuck you, Pearl.

42:22.514 --> 42:25.015
Arthur!

42:25.050 --> 42:27.010
