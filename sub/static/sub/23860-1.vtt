00:51.218 --> 00:53.912
So many people
settle for love that

00:53.913 --> 00:56.680
doesn't really ask
anything of them,

00:56.765 --> 00:59.428
that they don't have to
make any sacrifices for.

01:00.352 --> 01:01.638
I don't want that.

01:02.396 --> 01:05.855
I want an ideal love that I
have to give everything to.

01:56.408 --> 01:57.774
Where are you?

01:59.202 --> 02:00.818
Where are you?

02:06.585 --> 02:08.622
Why are you doing this?

02:27.606 --> 02:28.813
In the name of the Father...

02:33.987 --> 02:37.355
Benedicamus Domino

02:42.162 --> 02:45.655
Benedicamus Domino

02:45.749 --> 02:47.581
Dear Christ.

03:30.210 --> 03:33.248
I was 17 years old when
I came to the convent,

03:33.338 --> 03:35.546
18 when I entered the novitiate.

04:01.825 --> 04:04.533
I know a lot of people could
probably never understand...

04:10.375 --> 04:13.539
Never understand how
someone so young

04:13.628 --> 04:15.961
with their entire
life ahead of them

04:17.466 --> 04:19.673
would want to give
it all away to God.

04:26.141 --> 04:29.509
They think of nuns today, and
they see a bunch of old women.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.811
Women who couldn't find husbands,

04:31.897 --> 04:34.480
or for some reason,

04:34.566 --> 04:36.774
just couldn't make it
in the outside world.

04:45.202 --> 04:48.445
So they ran off to a monastery
to escape everything.

04:59.424 --> 05:03.338
What they don't understand is
that beneath everything else...

05:17.067 --> 05:18.899
We were women in love.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.527
You're all I could ever want.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.686
You ready for this?

05:55.772 --> 05:57.934
Okay, you can come
right out this way.

06:08.285 --> 06:09.617
Is my hair all right?

06:14.791 --> 06:16.248
Good morning, Father.

06:25.760 --> 06:29.253
Nora Harris? I can't
believe it. Is it you?

06:29.347 --> 06:31.304
Hey, Rob, it sure
is. How you been?

06:31.391 --> 06:34.054
I've been good. I've
been real good.

06:34.144 --> 06:38.013
Now, wait a minute. Now don't
tell me. Is this Cathleen?

06:38.690 --> 06:40.727
It sure is. Can you believe
it? Look how big she got.

06:40.817 --> 06:43.400
My goodness. Hey, pretty
lady. How are you?

06:43.486 --> 06:45.694
You know, you're not allowed
to grow up that fast.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.648
Soon, you'll be taller than me.

06:49.826 --> 06:52.159
I gotta say, Nora, I'm a little
surprised to see you here.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.577
I've known you all my life,

06:53.663 --> 06:55.347
and I don't think
I've ever seen you

06:55.348 --> 06:57.077
within 500 yards of
a Sunday service.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.079
Yeah, well, don't
get your hopes up.

06:59.169 --> 07:00.910
I'm not here to be saved
or nothing like that.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.165
I just thought it about time

07:02.255 --> 07:04.963
that Cathleen learned
what religion was about.

07:05.050 --> 07:07.081
Or supposed to be about, you know.

07:07.082 --> 07:08.082
Yeah.

07:08.083 --> 07:09.676
Plus, we were a little
bored, weren't we?

07:09.763 --> 07:12.255
Well, hey, that's all right with
me. I'm just glad you're here.

07:12.349 --> 07:13.816
- Let's get you all a good seat.
- All right.

07:13.892 --> 07:16.179
Come on in. Right there's
two, right up front there.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.181
Blessed be God the Father.

07:18.271 --> 07:22.436
Because although you have not
seen Him, you still love Him.

07:23.234 --> 07:26.352
Although you do not know Him,
you still believe in Him.

07:27.030 --> 07:30.740
You feel His presence all around
without knowing His name,

07:30.825 --> 07:35.069
and you rejoice with an
indescribable ecstasy.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.698
Because if there's
one thing we know,

07:38.792 --> 07:41.785
it's that God's love
is unconditional.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.373
Put your napkin in your lap.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.134
Thank you.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.642
Did you like going to
that church today?

07:58.728 --> 08:00.560
Yeah, I did.

08:00.647 --> 08:01.808
Yeah?

08:02.565 --> 08:04.522
What'd you like about it the most?

08:06.861 --> 08:08.102
I don't know.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.688
I guess I just thought
it was peaceful.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.858
"Peaceful," huh?

08:15.996 --> 08:18.204
Yeah, I guess it was
kind of peaceful.

08:18.289 --> 08:20.497
What kind of church was it, again?

08:21.209 --> 08:23.417
That was a Catholic church.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.921
Are we Catholic?

08:28.842 --> 08:30.174
No, we're not anything.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.798
I don't really believe
in religion, actually.

08:32.886 --> 08:35.220
I think it's kind
of a waste of time.

08:35.974 --> 08:40.684
But when you're older, you
can decide for yourself.

08:51.573 --> 08:53.530
Looks like Daddy's home.

09:03.835 --> 09:06.373
Hey, hey, hey, baby.

09:07.172 --> 09:09.664
How's Daddy's little girl?

09:10.717 --> 09:12.925
What'd you do today? Did
you have a good day today?

09:13.011 --> 09:14.127
Daddy, where were you?

09:14.220 --> 09:15.802
We've been waiting
for you for so long.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.472
Yeah, it's a valid question,
Chuck. Where you been?

09:18.558 --> 09:20.140
I was out. That's all.

09:20.226 --> 09:24.937
Okay. Because we've been sitting
here all day, waiting on you.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.639
You never heard of a phone or...

09:26.733 --> 09:29.146
Come on, Nora, please. Of
course I've heard of a phone.

09:29.235 --> 09:32.353
Well, that's good. You've heard
of a phone. That's nice.

09:33.615 --> 09:34.947
What do you want me to say, Nora?

09:35.200 --> 09:38.364
Is there anything in particular
that you'd like to hear me say?

09:38.453 --> 09:39.489
I don't know, Chuck.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.010
Maybe I'd just like
you to be a man

09:41.011 --> 09:42.322
every once in a while, you know?

09:42.415 --> 09:44.156
Be a fucking father for a change,

09:44.250 --> 09:46.207
maybe learn to sacrifice
a little bit.

09:46.294 --> 09:49.628
Give me a break, okay? Are
you serious with that?

09:49.714 --> 09:52.297
What, you want me to drop it,
Chuck? Is that what you want?

09:52.383 --> 09:53.624
- Yeah.
- Well, fuck you.

09:53.718 --> 09:56.802
Fuck me? Fuck you, Nora.

09:56.888 --> 09:59.301
As a matter of fact,
fuck all this shit.

09:59.390 --> 10:00.471
I'm sick of this.

10:00.558 --> 10:03.175
I'm sorry that I can't be the
person you want me to be.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.135
No, you can't be the man
I wanted you to be.

10:05.230 --> 10:07.062
- You are the opposite of that.
- Okay. All right.

10:07.148 --> 10:10.607
I was out. That's all. You
can't handle that, I'm gone.

10:10.693 --> 10:11.993
Where do you think
you're going, Chuck?

10:12.070 --> 10:13.070
You're not leaving.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.396
You got a little
girl now. Hear me?

10:15.490 --> 10:18.528
- If you leave, you get out.
- Well, fuck you.

10:27.919 --> 10:29.831
Honey, will you take this for me?

10:30.880 --> 10:32.041
You got it?

10:36.136 --> 10:37.752
Excuse me?

10:37.846 --> 10:39.678
Can I help you?

10:39.764 --> 10:41.596
Yes. Are you Mrs Harris?

10:42.225 --> 10:44.558
- Yes.
- My name is Sister Gloria.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.431
This is Sister Eleanor.

10:46.521 --> 10:48.513
We're from Our Lady
of Blessed Sorrows,

10:48.606 --> 10:50.939
the parochial school
just up the road.

10:51.901 --> 10:57.067
We are very proud to say that it
is the nuns, Sisters like us,

10:57.157 --> 11:00.400
who have built the Catholic
school system in this country,

11:00.493 --> 11:02.280
brick by brick.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.204
Your little one is so
lovely, by the way.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.703
May I ask how old?

11:07.792 --> 11:08.999
Cathleen is 12.

11:10.295 --> 11:13.163
Look, we appreciate
your coming by,

11:13.256 --> 11:16.624
but the truth is, we're
not all that religious.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.589
I mean, we go to church when
we can, like everybody else.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.137
But my husband, Cathleen's father,

11:22.223 --> 11:25.682
he left us a while back, so
it's just me taking care of us.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.511
Sorry to hear that, Mrs Harris.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.437
God cherishes your strength.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.480
But one thing you should know,

11:32.567 --> 11:34.900
our doors are open to everyone,

11:34.986 --> 11:37.569
practising, non-practising alike.

11:37.655 --> 11:42.070
Our first priority is just to
provide an exceptional education.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.704
Well, how much does
it cost? I don't

11:45.705 --> 11:47.280
know if we can afford this school.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.080
Well, that's just it.

11:49.167 --> 11:52.001
Right now, we're offering
full scholarships

11:52.587 --> 11:54.249
on a first-come basis.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.251
Silence, girls.

11:56.341 --> 11:57.832
Silence.

11:59.886 --> 12:02.549
How many in this room
were baptised Catholic?

12:04.682 --> 12:06.822
Don't worry, this
is not a judgement

12:06.823 --> 12:08.847
on anybody's background or belief.

12:08.937 --> 12:12.851
No, the reason I ask the question

12:12.941 --> 12:16.309
is because I wonder
if any of you know

12:16.402 --> 12:19.941
what the difference is between
the Catholic religion

12:20.031 --> 12:21.567
and all the other religions.

12:21.658 --> 12:25.868
Say like, the Protestants,
the Baptists, the Jews?

12:27.872 --> 12:29.204
Love

12:30.583 --> 12:34.167
and sacrifice.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.917
Love and sacrifice.

12:38.925 --> 12:42.293
Because if there's one
thing I know for certain,

12:42.387 --> 12:45.676
there can be no love

12:45.765 --> 12:48.178
without sacrifice.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.271
Hi, there.

12:59.362 --> 13:01.604
How come you're sitting all alone?

13:01.698 --> 13:04.281
You don't wanna join the others?

13:06.494 --> 13:08.702
They're all talking
about their boyfriends.

13:10.331 --> 13:12.288
I don't have a boyfriend.

13:12.375 --> 13:13.741
Oh, no?

13:14.877 --> 13:16.038
Me, neither.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.041
I'm told they're overrated.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.589
Mind if I join you?

13:23.094 --> 13:26.553
I'm Sister Margaret, by the
way. You're Cathleen, right?

13:27.265 --> 13:30.429
I haven't had you in my class
yet, but I've noticed you

13:30.518 --> 13:32.555
because you're shy, like me.

13:32.645 --> 13:37.185
You seem to like to be by
yourself a lot, to think a lot?

13:37.275 --> 13:39.016
I guess so.

13:39.110 --> 13:42.103
I like to be by myself
and think a lot, too.

13:42.822 --> 13:43.822
You do?

13:44.449 --> 13:46.190
What do you like to think about?

13:46.284 --> 13:48.776
Mostly about God.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.290
Can I show you something?

13:57.295 --> 13:59.252
You see that light in there?

14:00.089 --> 14:02.126
That's His light.

14:02.759 --> 14:07.550
And the statue to the side, the
Saviour, of course, Jesus Christ.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.341
Here, you wanna sit
down for a sec?

14:17.482 --> 14:18.689
Go ahead.

14:22.945 --> 14:25.779
Just because someone
likes to be alone

14:25.865 --> 14:28.733
doesn't mean they don't
still crave intimacy.

14:31.162 --> 14:35.497
You really think God
and Jesus are real?

14:35.583 --> 14:38.917
Of course I do. I more than do.

14:39.003 --> 14:41.336
Because I'm married
to them, silly.

14:42.590 --> 14:45.958
Didn't you know? All nuns
are brides of Christ.

14:47.428 --> 14:48.760
But why?

14:48.846 --> 14:51.680
I bet you could have married
anyone you wanted to.

14:53.017 --> 14:56.681
Well, I'm not so sure about that.

14:58.022 --> 14:59.263
And either way,

14:59.357 --> 15:01.648
I doubt any other
relationship would

15:01.649 --> 15:03.567
have been quite as fulfilling.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.488
I gotta go. I've got class.

15:15.039 --> 15:16.200
Are you coming?

15:16.290 --> 15:19.030
I think I'll stay
for a little while,

15:19.031 --> 15:21.410
if that's okay with you, Sister.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.541
Of course.

15:49.365 --> 15:50.822
Good night, Cathleen.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.490
Good night, Miss Williams.

16:05.798 --> 16:06.834
Hi.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.215
Who is he?

16:15.516 --> 16:18.475
He's just a friend
of mine, that's all.

16:18.561 --> 16:19.802
Another one?

16:22.607 --> 16:25.145
What are you doing
up so early, anyway?

16:25.234 --> 16:27.977
I set my alarm so I can
go to Mass before school.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.072
Okay.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.779
You need a ride?

16:34.869 --> 16:36.576
That's okay.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.124
Hey, Cathleen?

16:44.587 --> 16:49.423
You're not getting too into God
and all that stuff, are you?

16:51.344 --> 16:53.006
What do you mean?

16:53.095 --> 16:57.089
I just mean there's more to life
than God and church and praying.

18:04.166 --> 18:05.998
You're serious, Cathleen?

18:08.462 --> 18:12.672
I honestly didn't even realise
you'd been considering this.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.091
I want to give my life to God.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.386
You're such a passionate girl.

18:18.472 --> 18:21.135
You remind me of
myself at your age.

18:21.225 --> 18:23.638
I think you're making
the right decision.

18:23.728 --> 18:26.391
A nun? What are you talking about?

18:26.480 --> 18:28.392
That's just fucking
crazy, Cathleen.

18:28.482 --> 18:29.563
I knew you wouldn't understand,

18:29.650 --> 18:31.117
but you don't have to
understand. I didn't...

18:31.193 --> 18:32.309
It's not that I don't understand,

18:32.403 --> 18:35.237
it's just that it's the
stupidest idea I've ever heard.

18:35.323 --> 18:37.110
You throw your life
away in some convent...

18:37.199 --> 18:38.406
But I'm not throwing my life away.

18:38.492 --> 18:39.903
I don't know how you
can even say that...

18:39.994 --> 18:41.361
You're absolutely
throwing your life away.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.195
Well, I don't get it.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.325
Do you think I wanted this?

18:44.415 --> 18:45.872
Do you think I wanted
to be a single mother?

18:45.958 --> 18:47.790
But it's not about that. It
has nothing to do with you.

18:47.877 --> 18:48.877
Then what is it?

18:48.961 --> 18:51.328
- I'm in love, Mum.
- You're in love with who?

18:53.049 --> 18:54.631
What?

18:57.845 --> 18:59.131
God?

19:00.056 --> 19:03.049
Oh, my God, that's crazy.
That is fucking crazy.

19:03.142 --> 19:06.306
That doesn't even make
sense, "in love with God."

19:07.563 --> 19:09.600
I don't know how to explain this,

19:11.025 --> 19:12.937
but I was called, and
I'm gonna become a nun.

19:13.027 --> 19:14.438
And there's really
nothing that you can say

19:14.528 --> 19:16.110
that's gonna make
me change my mind.

19:19.450 --> 19:20.941
Cathleen.

19:23.454 --> 19:25.320
You're a 17-year-old girl.

19:26.415 --> 19:28.498
You don't know anything
about religion.

19:29.669 --> 19:32.878
And you sure as hell don't
know anything about love.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.768
Where are you?

19:51.982 --> 19:53.564
It's not right.

19:56.112 --> 19:57.819
It's not fair.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.527
Someone gives you
their whole life...

20:03.828 --> 20:05.239
Where are you?

20:37.653 --> 20:39.315
Good afternoon, all of you.

20:39.405 --> 20:42.773
My name is Reverend
Mother Marie St Clair.

20:42.867 --> 20:45.402
You can call me
"Reverend Mother," or

20:45.403 --> 20:47.737
simply "Mother," if you prefer it.

20:48.497 --> 20:51.035
I am the Mother
Superior, or Abbess

20:51.125 --> 20:55.369
of this particular order of
Sisters of Beloved Rose.

20:56.046 --> 20:59.960
I myself have been a Rose
for nearly 40 years.

21:00.050 --> 21:03.134
Meaning, some 40 years ago,

21:03.220 --> 21:05.462
I first came through those
gates as a postulant,

21:05.556 --> 21:07.218
same as all of you.

21:07.892 --> 21:11.385
And now, 40 years later,

21:11.479 --> 21:15.268
I have not once set foot
outside those gates.

21:16.233 --> 21:19.067
So, as far as all of
you are concerned,

21:19.153 --> 21:21.941
you might consider me like the
voice of God around here.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.985
Meaning, since unfortunately

21:25.075 --> 21:28.159
God can't be here to run
this convent Himself,

21:28.245 --> 21:32.489
my voice will serve as
a stand-in for His.

21:32.583 --> 21:36.076
And you can expect that
whenever you hear me speak,

21:36.170 --> 21:39.038
it is on behalf of His wishes.

21:40.007 --> 21:41.339
And over the next two years,

21:41.425 --> 21:45.260
I personally will be separating
the wheat from the chaff,

21:45.679 --> 21:49.389
determining which of
you actually belong,

21:49.475 --> 21:50.841
as opposed to which of you

21:50.935 --> 21:54.645
are simply victims of a
childish imagination.

21:55.147 --> 22:00.438
Because in this monastery,
God is not a fantasy to us.

22:01.111 --> 22:04.900
Not a fantasy, not a daydream,

22:04.990 --> 22:07.653
and certainly not your
invisible best friend.

22:08.869 --> 22:12.533
To the contrary, God
is work. Hard work.

22:12.623 --> 22:16.958
The work of a very
special kind of love,

22:17.044 --> 22:18.831
which you'll all be trained in.

22:19.755 --> 22:23.169
You'll be spending the next
six months as postulants.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.843
After that, and for those
of you who make it,

22:26.929 --> 22:31.173
you'll take your very first
vows and enter the novitiate.

22:31.267 --> 22:35.136
And as a rule, we make it a point
to never discuss the novitiate

22:35.229 --> 22:37.846
until we've been
through it ourselves.

22:37.940 --> 22:42.105
So for now, you'll
just have to wait.

22:42.778 --> 22:46.237
Finally, I'd like to
talk about silence.

22:46.824 --> 22:49.658
We observe two kinds
of silence here,

22:49.743 --> 22:53.783
regular silence and grand silence.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.284
During regular silence,

22:55.374 --> 22:58.742
if you feel you have the need
to speak, it's permissible.

22:58.836 --> 23:01.704
But when you hear that
bell at 9:00 at night,

23:01.797 --> 23:04.790
signifying the beginning
of grand silence,

23:04.884 --> 23:09.299
that means you don't talk.

23:10.306 --> 23:11.672
Any questions?

23:13.767 --> 23:16.601
Put your hand down, Sister.
Postulants don't have questions.

23:16.687 --> 23:18.770
And you are free to go home.

24:47.903 --> 24:49.269
Good afternoon, Mother.
Praise the Lord.

24:49.363 --> 24:50.729
Now and forever. God bless.

24:51.740 --> 24:54.608
- Praise the Lord.
- Now and forever. God bless.

24:55.077 --> 24:56.659
Good afternoon, Mother.
Praise the Lord.

24:56.745 --> 24:58.702
Now and forever.
God bless, Sister.

25:05.671 --> 25:09.631
Totally love Him, who gave
Himself totally for your love.

25:10.551 --> 25:13.794
He, Christ, is the splendour
of eternal glory,

25:13.887 --> 25:17.972
the brightness of eternal light
and the mirror without cloud.

25:25.065 --> 25:27.728
I haven't had the chance to
formally introduce myself yet.

25:27.818 --> 25:29.650
I'm Sister Mary Grace.

25:29.737 --> 25:32.480
I will be your postulant mistress
for the next six months,

25:32.573 --> 25:35.156
perhaps your novice
mistress after that.

25:35.242 --> 25:37.404
This is Sister Anne.

25:38.078 --> 25:40.286
Sister Catherine, Kate.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.740
Both professed nuns. Both
just took their final vows.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.621
We're very proud of them.

25:45.711 --> 25:48.200
Now, it is our job
to help guide you as

25:48.201 --> 25:50.502
you try to adapt to
our way of life.

25:50.591 --> 25:54.005
I'm sure at the beginning,
it will feel very different.

25:54.094 --> 25:55.756
That's normal.

25:55.846 --> 26:00.557
I remember when I first came here,
everything seemed so strange.

26:00.642 --> 26:03.510
I didn't know if I'd ever
truly make it as a nun.

26:03.604 --> 26:05.561
Please don't worry about that.

26:05.647 --> 26:07.309
I'm sure you all will be great.

26:08.192 --> 26:11.026
Now, we should probably
go over the schedule.

26:11.695 --> 26:15.530
Postulants usually have the
same schedule every single day.

26:15.616 --> 26:18.984
The most important thing to
pay attention to is the bell.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.946
Pretty much everything we
do here, all day long,

26:22.039 --> 26:23.405
all comes down to the bell.

26:27.211 --> 26:31.080
The first bell you'll hear each
morning is the 5:00 am bell.

26:32.549 --> 26:34.131
That bell lets everyone know

26:34.218 --> 26:37.427
it's time to wake up, get
ready for morning Mass.

26:47.314 --> 26:50.022
Mass begins once
Father Luca arrives.

26:50.109 --> 26:53.318
Father Luca always keeps his
back to us the whole time,

26:53.403 --> 26:56.111
and he always reads
the liturgy in Latin.

26:56.198 --> 26:57.939
Sometimes it's hard to keep up.

26:59.827 --> 27:01.068
After daily chores,

27:01.161 --> 27:03.403
you'll hear the third
bell of the morning.

27:03.497 --> 27:06.581
That lets us know that
grand silence is over.

27:07.501 --> 27:09.868
Good afternoon, Mother.
Praise the Lord.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.546
Now and forever. God bless.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.045
Good afternoon, Mother.
Praise the Lord.

27:17.761 --> 27:21.880
As you probably noticed, all our
meals begin with a reading.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.715
Even though it's
after grand silence,

27:23.809 --> 27:27.177
we should all try and remain
as quiet as possible.

27:28.063 --> 27:29.770
Sometimes you might see
some of the novices

27:29.857 --> 27:32.895
doing their own penances
in the refectory.

27:32.985 --> 27:36.569
Probably best to just ignore it
until you're novices yourselves.

27:39.658 --> 27:43.868
Every day after the 3:00 pm bell,
we'll have our lessons together.

27:43.954 --> 27:47.948
As you probably remember, Reverend
Mother made it absolutely clear

27:48.041 --> 27:51.534
that we are not to speak
during grand silence,

27:51.628 --> 27:54.211
so let's practise a little
bit of sign language.

27:54.298 --> 27:56.085
Slowly, that is, "What...

27:59.011 --> 28:00.011
"Job...

28:03.807 --> 28:05.093
"Right now?"

28:39.801 --> 28:40.882
Sorry to interrupt, Mother,

28:40.969 --> 28:44.053
but you just got another
package from the Archdiocese.

28:44.139 --> 28:45.139
What?

28:59.071 --> 29:01.404
They can't be serious.

29:03.492 --> 29:05.074
Thank you, Sister.

29:09.998 --> 29:12.160
What are they asking of us?

29:18.799 --> 29:24.136
My mother always said at least
one child should be sacrificed.

29:24.221 --> 29:26.884
And even though I come
from a big family,

29:26.974 --> 29:29.637
I'm the only girl
with five brothers,

29:29.726 --> 29:35.063
so I guess it was pretty obvious
who was going to become a nun.

29:35.691 --> 29:38.559
Honestly, though, I'm
really happy to be here.

29:38.652 --> 29:42.236
And I know that it's
supposed to be so hard,

29:42.322 --> 29:46.282
but I really can't wait
until we get to novitiate

29:46.368 --> 29:48.735
and we get to wear
those white veils.

29:50.289 --> 29:51.450
Who wants to go next?

29:54.960 --> 29:58.499
Well, as for me, I
have two cousins,

29:58.588 --> 30:02.923
an aunt and one older sister
who joined the Sisterhood.

30:03.010 --> 30:07.254
So, I guess, in a way,
it's kind of in my blood.

30:07.973 --> 30:11.592
And who knows, maybe one day I'll
die young and become a saint.

30:14.271 --> 30:15.432
Thank you, Sister Emily.

30:17.941 --> 30:22.060
Sister Cathleen, did you always
know that you wanted to be a nun?

30:24.489 --> 30:27.197
No, actually, I wasn't
raised in the Church, so...

30:27.284 --> 30:30.277
What do you mean, you weren't
raised in the Church?

30:30.370 --> 30:31.486
Aren't you Catholic?

30:31.580 --> 30:35.950
I guess I'm not Catholic in the
same way that you guys are.

30:36.043 --> 30:37.784
Well, what are you
even doing here, then?

30:37.878 --> 30:39.585
I mean, is this even allowed?

30:39.671 --> 30:41.913
Sister Candace, please. Ladies.

30:43.467 --> 30:44.708
I went to Catholic school.

30:45.135 --> 30:46.842
That's where I learned
about the Sisters.

30:46.928 --> 30:51.218
I just thought it seemed like
the most beautiful idea,

30:52.184 --> 30:55.348
to be able to spend my
entire life devoted to love.

30:57.814 --> 30:59.430
Tell me about the new postulants.

30:59.524 --> 31:01.436
I'm so impressed with
them as a group.

31:01.526 --> 31:04.485
They're full of energy
and enthusiasm,

31:04.571 --> 31:06.201
really passionate
about finding their

31:06.202 --> 31:07.530
own relationships with Christ.

31:14.456 --> 31:15.788
What is this you're reading?

31:15.874 --> 31:20.790
This is something to do
with this Vatican II.

31:22.214 --> 31:23.750
Vatican what?

31:26.718 --> 31:28.209
From what I can make out,

31:28.303 --> 31:30.545
our Pope has suddenly
got it into his head

31:30.639 --> 31:33.677
to turn himself into
some sort of reformer.

31:33.767 --> 31:35.599
Meaning what, exactly?

31:35.685 --> 31:38.428
Meaning he's organised some
ridiculous new council in Rome

31:38.522 --> 31:41.105
to speak about changes
to the Church.

31:41.191 --> 31:43.524
Well, that's a good
thing, isn't it?

31:44.277 --> 31:47.395
The Church hasn't reviewed its
practises in over 100 years.

31:47.489 --> 31:48.489
Perhaps change is...

31:48.573 --> 31:50.064
You think the Church
is in need of change?

31:51.034 --> 31:53.117
Are you questioning me?

31:53.203 --> 31:55.866
I happen to think the Church
is perfect the way it is.

31:55.956 --> 31:58.323
Well, what reforms are
they talking about?

31:58.417 --> 32:00.784
- Can I see?
- It's not important.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.036
This will all blow over very soon.

32:03.130 --> 32:05.543
It's nothing to concern
yourself with.

32:05.632 --> 32:08.090
Pay attention. I'm going
to show you how we walk.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.634
It's called "custody of the eyes."

32:10.720 --> 32:13.633
You put your hands in
your sleeve like this.

32:13.723 --> 32:17.512
Always go slowly, gracefully,
never in a hurry.

32:17.602 --> 32:20.515
And most important is you
keep your eyes down.

32:20.605 --> 32:21.937
Always make sure you're looking

32:22.023 --> 32:24.106
straight ahead at the
floor in front of you.

32:24.192 --> 32:25.273
Why?

32:25.360 --> 32:26.567
Excuse me?

32:27.320 --> 32:28.856
Why do we have to walk like that?

32:28.947 --> 32:31.314
I mean, what if we can't
see where we're going?

32:33.660 --> 32:35.367
Not that it's your place
to question anything,

32:35.454 --> 32:36.911
but it's a part of our discipline.

32:36.997 --> 32:38.238
We keep our eyes down

32:38.331 --> 32:40.288
so we don't allow in
any extra stimulation

32:40.375 --> 32:42.162
that might distract
us from our Lord.

32:44.087 --> 32:45.953
Something funny, Sisters?

32:46.548 --> 32:47.664
You two, come here.

32:48.508 --> 32:49.508
Come on.

32:52.053 --> 32:53.669
Stand face-to-face.

32:55.348 --> 32:57.840
Now, both of you look at
each other in the eyes.

33:15.619 --> 33:19.329
- What just happened?
- I started thinking about her.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.537
Yeah, I started thinking
about her, too.

33:23.627 --> 33:26.461
Exactly. We're not supposed
to think about each other.

33:26.546 --> 33:30.415
Because we're not here for each
other, we are here only for God.

33:31.176 --> 33:32.383
Move on, Sisters.

33:36.932 --> 33:38.548
I love you, God.

33:47.234 --> 33:48.975
Thank you for letting me be here.

33:51.238 --> 33:53.571
Thank you for letting
me love you like this.

33:57.661 --> 34:00.404
Thank you for letting me
feel you so close to me.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.405
Thank you.

34:07.921 --> 34:09.456
I love you, God.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.632
I love you so much.

34:17.013 --> 34:21.098
This is the first time I've
seen you in your outfit.

34:21.184 --> 34:22.219
Yeah.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.099
Do you like it?

34:26.188 --> 34:28.897
- You look like a real nun.
- Thanks.

34:29.818 --> 34:32.481
I'm not a real nun
yet. Not yet, but...

34:34.114 --> 34:35.480
What is with this thing?

34:35.574 --> 34:38.987
This is terrible.
It's like prison.

34:39.077 --> 34:41.284
Yeah, it's just the
way they do it.

34:41.371 --> 34:44.580
It's like a symbol
of our enclosure.

34:44.666 --> 34:46.123
What the...

34:47.960 --> 34:49.452
What does that mean?

34:51.255 --> 34:52.417
It's nothing.

34:54.634 --> 34:56.466
So, how are you?

34:57.137 --> 35:00.676
Are you... You like it
here? Are you happy?

35:00.765 --> 35:02.131
Yeah.

35:02.809 --> 35:04.300
Yeah, I am.

35:06.062 --> 35:11.353
I don't know how to describe it,
but it feels like I belong here.

35:13.987 --> 35:16.342
I guess that means
you plan on staying,

35:16.343 --> 35:18.402
and you plan on taking those vows.

35:18.491 --> 35:20.574
What do they call
it, the "novanate"?

35:20.660 --> 35:23.403
- Novitiate.
- "Novitiate." Nova-something?

35:25.373 --> 35:27.349
Yeah, it's just a temporary vow

35:27.350 --> 35:29.708
that we take for a
year and a half.

35:29.794 --> 35:32.002
And we find out

35:32.088 --> 35:36.549
if we're ready to
marry God forever.

35:39.679 --> 35:42.968
I'm pretty sure I'm going
to be here my whole life.

35:44.601 --> 35:48.595
Jesus Christ, Cathleen, what
the hell did I do wrong?

35:55.195 --> 35:56.195
How...

35:57.656 --> 35:58.817
How have you been?

36:01.618 --> 36:02.904
Well, I'm just fine.

36:03.870 --> 36:07.034
I picked up a few more shifts
at work, keeping myself busy.

36:07.123 --> 36:09.786
I don't really know
what to do with myself.

36:10.794 --> 36:15.539
Because I most... I... I
mostly just miss you so much.

36:16.966 --> 36:20.209
How about Dad? How's Dad?

36:20.303 --> 36:21.934
Have you heard anything from Dad?

36:21.935 --> 36:22.935
Your father? No.

36:23.515 --> 36:27.725
Your grandma did call and said
he'd been sick or something.

36:27.811 --> 36:29.803
That's probably why you
haven't heard from him.

36:29.896 --> 36:31.128
But do you want me
to track him down?

36:31.129 --> 36:32.296
I'm sure he'd love
to come see you.

36:32.357 --> 36:36.271
That's okay, don't bother.
I'll pray for him.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.982
It's fine.

36:39.948 --> 36:42.031
But it's like a... It's
a really busy day here.

36:42.117 --> 36:44.200
I should get going.

36:44.285 --> 36:48.120
What? No. We have
ten more minutes.

36:48.206 --> 36:50.620
I know, but I just
have a lot of work.

36:50.621 --> 36:51.916
What are you doing?

36:52.001 --> 36:53.993
Maybe we can spend more time
together next time, though.

36:54.087 --> 36:58.582
Okay. Well, can you just wait?
Wait, wait, wait. Wait one second?

37:01.469 --> 37:04.678
Maybe I could just touch
your hand for a second.

37:07.475 --> 37:09.182
- Just for a second.
- Yeah...

37:09.811 --> 37:11.848
We're really not supposed to
touch like that, Mum, so...

37:11.938 --> 37:13.804
- Okay.
- I gotta go.

37:14.607 --> 37:17.395
Okay. Cathleen, I love you.

37:18.236 --> 37:19.602
Thank you for coming.

37:21.614 --> 37:22.821
Oh, God.

37:36.463 --> 37:40.958
I guess I just didn't really know
it was going to be like this.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.131
Like what?

37:42.218 --> 37:44.122
That we'll be spending our whole

37:44.123 --> 37:46.383
entire lives here
and never leaving.

37:46.473 --> 37:49.011
We won't even be able to go
to our own parents' funerals.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.030
Who cares? They'll
be dead, anyway.

37:51.031 --> 37:52.639
It's not like they'll notice.

37:53.730 --> 37:58.646
Besides, don't you think knowing
God knows we're here for Him,

37:58.735 --> 38:01.218
knowing we are so
much more special

38:01.219 --> 38:03.150
to Him than anybody else...

38:03.823 --> 38:06.190
Don't you think that
makes it all worth it?

38:08.661 --> 38:10.573
Yeah, I guess.

38:10.663 --> 38:13.201
Well, why did you come here, then?

38:14.584 --> 38:15.950
Audrey Hepburn.

38:18.087 --> 38:19.749
What are you talking about?

38:20.340 --> 38:21.797
Audrey Hepburn.

38:22.926 --> 38:25.669
I wanted to be a nun

38:25.762 --> 38:31.554
because I saw A Nun's Story,
and she's Sister Gabrielle.

38:32.352 --> 38:33.593
And I just thought

38:33.686 --> 38:38.727
she was so holy and
beautiful and perfect.

38:41.528 --> 38:44.487
I wanted to be like
her. Don't laugh at me.

38:44.572 --> 38:47.189
That's not very holy.

38:48.284 --> 38:49.650
I won't tell anybody.

38:50.370 --> 38:52.077
This was a mistake.

38:53.706 --> 38:55.493
I was too young for it.

39:00.296 --> 39:03.084
I didn't ever mean
to disappoint you.

39:08.429 --> 39:11.092
I just don't know if
I feel it, you know?

39:13.309 --> 39:14.390
Feel what?

39:17.730 --> 39:21.394
My relationship with Him.

39:22.569 --> 39:24.856
Whatever we're supposed to feel.

39:28.950 --> 39:33.365
I can't tell if I'm
communicating with Him,

39:33.955 --> 39:37.665
and it's really Him or if
it's just all in my head.

39:41.212 --> 39:45.582
Reverend Mother says we can't fake

39:45.675 --> 39:47.507
our relationship with Him.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.461
Because if...

39:50.555 --> 39:55.095
Even if nobody else knows, He'll
know and He'll shun us for it.

39:57.353 --> 40:01.097
But I'm just worried,
what if I'm faking it,

40:01.691 --> 40:03.808
and I don't even realise?

41:29.570 --> 41:32.028
No, I have them right
here in front of me. I...

41:38.621 --> 41:41.034
It's not that I wasn't
going to respond. I...

41:43.126 --> 41:45.368
Of course I understand
the historic...

41:50.341 --> 41:52.048
And also with you.

42:22.457 --> 42:23.457
Good morning, Reverend Mother.

42:23.541 --> 42:25.032
- Praise the Lord.
- Now and forever.

42:25.960 --> 42:27.826
Did you just speak?

42:29.213 --> 42:31.125
Did I just hear you speak?

42:36.304 --> 42:39.263
What's your name?

42:41.517 --> 42:42.633
I'm Sister Sissy.

42:42.727 --> 42:44.138
Sister Sissy?

42:45.354 --> 42:47.767
Well, Sister Sissy...

42:49.442 --> 42:52.105
Why don't you tell me what
you've been doing lately,

42:52.195 --> 42:55.063
besides getting fat,
being late for Mass,

42:55.823 --> 42:58.486
and talking during grand silence.

43:02.830 --> 43:06.790
I didn't realise it was
still grand silence.

43:08.044 --> 43:11.082
Well, because they told us to
count the bells before noon.

43:11.172 --> 43:12.172
And I counted...

43:12.256 --> 43:14.714
Do you not understand
what "silence" means?

43:15.468 --> 43:17.676
Was it not explained
to you properly?

43:20.640 --> 43:23.508
During grand silence,
you are silent.

43:24.102 --> 43:26.936
And silence means you don't talk.

43:27.021 --> 43:28.762
You shut your mouth.

43:30.817 --> 43:34.527
But, Reverend Mother,
you're talking.

43:34.612 --> 43:37.320
That is because I am reprimanding
you right now, Jenny.

43:37.406 --> 43:40.490
- I am reprimanding you.
- It's "Sissy."

43:44.372 --> 43:45.954
I don't care in the least.

43:46.040 --> 43:47.906
I want you to get down
on your hands and knees

43:48.000 --> 43:49.000
and crawl all the way here.

43:49.085 --> 43:52.499
Say as many Hail Marys as you
can, from here to there.

43:53.005 --> 43:54.621
Right now.

43:55.675 --> 43:57.837
On your hands and knees, Sister.

44:01.848 --> 44:03.965
Hail... Hail Mary...

44:04.183 --> 44:05.890
Are you talking?

44:06.102 --> 44:08.936
Do I still hear you talking?

44:15.194 --> 44:17.106
Silence.

44:56.110 --> 44:58.022
I didn't have any clue.

45:00.406 --> 45:02.489
Sorry. I didn't realise
anybody was here.

45:02.575 --> 45:03.575
No, no, it's okay.

45:05.494 --> 45:06.860
Come here.

45:07.121 --> 45:09.078
Come here. I'd like
to talk to you.

45:19.675 --> 45:22.133
- How are you, Sister Cathleen?
- Good.

45:23.721 --> 45:24.962
Thank you.

45:26.140 --> 45:28.223
And the other girls?

45:28.309 --> 45:30.892
Are they still upset about
Sister Sissy being sent home?

45:32.438 --> 45:35.055
Everybody mostly understands.

45:36.108 --> 45:38.350
We all miss her. I
miss her, but...

45:38.694 --> 45:40.026
Of course.

45:41.656 --> 45:44.023
Do you often come here
to pray by yourself?

45:44.367 --> 45:45.949
Sometimes.

45:46.994 --> 45:49.281
Especially now that our
first vows are coming up.

45:49.664 --> 45:53.624
I just wanted to spend some extra
time communicating with Him,

45:53.709 --> 45:58.079
and make sure He's okay
with me becoming a novice.

45:59.298 --> 46:01.631
I'm pretty sure He's okay with it.

46:03.135 --> 46:05.593
I think you're gonna
be a great nun.

46:05.680 --> 46:07.216
Thank you, Sister.

46:19.986 --> 46:22.148
Just do me a favour, okay?

46:23.531 --> 46:26.444
Please make sure this
is what you want.

46:28.661 --> 46:30.573
Do you understand what I'm saying?

46:33.833 --> 46:35.165
Okay.

46:36.669 --> 46:39.412
Lord, please forgive me, I
haven't done well today.

46:41.507 --> 46:43.749
I didn't focus enough on
my prayers this morning,

46:43.843 --> 46:45.129
and I rushed to Mass

46:46.554 --> 46:48.887
because I just wanted
to be with my friends.

46:51.309 --> 46:53.676
And I'm sorry,
sometimes I feel like

46:53.894 --> 46:56.682
I pay more attention to
my friends than I do you.

46:58.649 --> 47:00.481
And I just pray that
you censure my heart,

47:01.610 --> 47:04.853
and you centre my thoughts
and my mind only on you.

47:04.947 --> 47:07.610
You shall speak to him

47:07.700 --> 47:11.193
And put the words in his mouth

47:11.287 --> 47:14.405
And I will be with your mouth

47:14.623 --> 47:16.956
And with his mouth

47:17.043 --> 47:20.832
And will teach you both what to do

47:20.963 --> 47:23.797
You shall speak to him

47:23.883 --> 47:27.126
And put the words in his mouth

47:27.219 --> 47:30.587
And I will be with your mouth

47:30.681 --> 47:32.923
And with his mouth

47:33.017 --> 47:36.977
And will teach you both what to do

47:37.313 --> 47:39.896
You shall speak to him

47:39.982 --> 47:43.146
And put the words in his mouth

47:43.235 --> 47:46.444
And I will be with your mouth

47:46.530 --> 47:48.567
And with his mouth

47:48.657 --> 47:52.241
And will teach you both what to do

47:52.828 --> 47:55.821
You shall speak to him

47:55.915 --> 47:59.124
And put the words in his mouth

47:59.210 --> 48:02.499
And I will be with your mouth

48:02.588 --> 48:04.921
And with his mouth

48:05.007 --> 48:09.047
And will teach you both what to do

48:09.136 --> 48:11.503
You shall speak to him

48:12.056 --> 48:15.595
And put the words in his mouth

48:15.810 --> 48:18.974
And I will be with your mouth

48:19.105 --> 48:20.437
And with his mouth

48:20.523 --> 48:21.639
Keep going.

48:21.732 --> 48:25.021
And will teach you both what to do

48:25.653 --> 48:26.734
Keep singing.

48:26.821 --> 48:28.357
You shall speak to him

48:28.447 --> 48:31.861
And put the words in his mouth

48:31.951 --> 48:33.943
I owe you no explanation
whatsoever.

48:34.036 --> 48:36.073
I just want you to
collect your belongings

48:36.163 --> 48:38.906
and get yourselves back home.

48:41.377 --> 48:43.585
All right, out you go.

48:43.671 --> 48:45.207
Enough's enough.

48:47.341 --> 48:48.582
Come along.

49:00.479 --> 49:02.562
- What just happened?
- Nothing.

49:02.648 --> 49:04.264
I'm sending those two girls home.

49:04.608 --> 49:07.601
You're sending Mariana
and Teresa home?

49:09.989 --> 49:11.605
I was told that their relationship

49:11.699 --> 49:13.406
was veering toward
something inappropriate.

49:13.492 --> 49:15.575
But they're just
young girls, right?

49:15.995 --> 49:17.827
Perhaps they're just friends.

49:17.913 --> 49:20.246
Perhaps they're just seeking
comfort in each other.

49:21.041 --> 49:23.283
Seeking comfort in each other?

49:23.627 --> 49:25.960
Is that what we do
around here now?

49:27.756 --> 49:29.338
Are you questioning me again?

49:31.260 --> 49:34.003
Are you questioning my judgement?

49:35.806 --> 49:38.219
So, why don't you
tell me, Mary Grace.

49:38.309 --> 49:41.222
How are those two girls expected
to go their entire lives

49:41.353 --> 49:43.766
without any form of
physical affection,

49:43.856 --> 49:46.439
when they can't even
make it a few months?

49:47.526 --> 49:48.562
I don't know.

49:49.612 --> 49:55.028
You know, there have
been moments, recently,

49:58.078 --> 50:00.445
when it's begun to feel to me

50:00.539 --> 50:04.328
as if you don't want to
be here with us any more.

50:05.419 --> 50:10.210
As if everything requires some
sort of inquisition by you.

50:14.136 --> 50:16.048
What is your trouble exactly?

50:16.138 --> 50:17.504
Part of my trouble is you.

50:18.224 --> 50:19.635
Me?

50:19.725 --> 50:21.557
I don't understand
your motivations.

50:21.644 --> 50:23.636
God is my motivation.

50:23.729 --> 50:26.642
God is my reason and motivation
for everything I do.

50:26.774 --> 50:28.515
How can you be absolutely
certain of what He wants?

50:28.609 --> 50:29.645
I am quite certain.

50:29.777 --> 50:32.815
I think it's wrong of you to keep
us in the dark about Vatican II.

50:32.905 --> 50:34.271
Whatever's in those documents,

50:34.365 --> 50:35.822
whatever it is that
you're hiding from us,

50:35.908 --> 50:37.865
that's going to
affect all of us...

50:37.952 --> 50:40.035
It is not going to
affect any of us.

50:40.120 --> 50:43.158
- This will affect none of us.
- Why can't you just tell me?

50:43.874 --> 50:47.288
Because I don't want to. I don't
have to, and I don't want to.

50:47.378 --> 50:49.119
- Fine, Mother.
- Yes, fine.

50:49.213 --> 50:51.000
Fine indeed, Mary.

51:24.290 --> 51:26.498
I just wanted to...

51:27.918 --> 51:31.662
I just wanted to tell you I've
decided to leave the convent.

51:32.047 --> 51:33.413
What?

51:36.010 --> 51:37.706
I'm very sorry that
I won't be there

51:37.707 --> 51:39.219
to see you take your first vows.

51:39.305 --> 51:41.342
What do you mean?
Where are you going?

51:41.515 --> 51:43.131
It's because of Reverend
Mother, isn't it?

51:43.642 --> 51:45.258
She wants to take
you away from us.

51:45.436 --> 51:48.099
No, no, no, that's not it.

51:48.480 --> 51:50.597
This is my decision.

51:51.358 --> 51:54.101
I've been a Rose since
I was 16 years old.

51:55.613 --> 51:57.730
My time here has been wonderful,

51:58.240 --> 52:00.232
but I am not meant
to be here any more.

52:01.327 --> 52:04.911
Will you still be a member of
the Church after you leave?

52:07.833 --> 52:09.244
Yes.

52:10.461 --> 52:12.248
This is my family.

52:13.672 --> 52:16.415
You, each and every one of you

52:16.508 --> 52:19.751
that I've spent day
in and day out with.

52:19.845 --> 52:24.681
I love each and every one of you
with everything in my heart.

52:29.146 --> 52:33.811
"We become what we love and who
we love shapes what we become.

52:33.901 --> 52:37.269
"Imitation is not a literal
mimicking of Christ,

52:37.363 --> 52:39.901
"rather it means becoming
the image of the beloved.

52:40.824 --> 52:43.692
"An image disclosed
through transformation."

53:04.765 --> 53:06.301
Be still...

53:07.101 --> 53:08.342
Please clear the way

53:08.435 --> 53:11.269
for my untouched
virginal body to pass.

53:11.605 --> 53:13.141
There's a new era coming,

53:13.816 --> 53:15.808
a new wind blowing in here.

53:16.151 --> 53:18.234
There will come a time, very soon,

53:18.320 --> 53:21.859
when all your cathedrals
will finally crumble.

53:21.990 --> 53:26.109
All these trappings and clothing
falling away to the ground.

53:26.453 --> 53:28.194
And it'll be us, all of us,

53:29.123 --> 53:31.866
standing here naked before God.

54:06.660 --> 54:08.401
Girls, we only have
a few more minutes.

54:10.122 --> 54:12.409
- We have a long way to go.
- Can you do it yourself?

54:13.041 --> 54:14.452
Our parents are out there.

54:14.960 --> 54:16.417
Does anyone have a
knitting needle?

54:16.545 --> 54:18.286
Sister Anne, do you have
any knitting needles?

54:19.006 --> 54:20.338
I don't even have them.

54:20.424 --> 54:21.827
Can someone help
her with her veil?

54:21.828 --> 54:22.828
I'll get it.

54:23.385 --> 54:24.421
I need a band.

56:01.942 --> 56:03.433
With the help of God,

56:04.570 --> 56:06.186
I have come to know
in this community...

56:06.488 --> 56:10.107
both the difficulty and the joy of
a life completely devoted to Him.

56:10.576 --> 56:14.195
My desire is to be allowed to
make perpetual profession.

56:14.496 --> 56:18.706
I seek to become a temporary bride
of Christ for a year and a half

56:18.792 --> 56:21.785
and to persevere in all
of my undying love.

57:30.447 --> 57:34.282
May we be worthy of Christ's love.

57:45.420 --> 57:49.209
We're married. We're
married. We're married.

57:49.299 --> 57:51.882
- I love you, God.
- I love you, Jesus.

57:58.016 --> 57:59.803
I'm married to Jesus.

58:01.645 --> 58:03.136
Christ. Christ.

58:05.107 --> 58:07.520
The novitiate, as I'm
sure you've all heard,

58:09.695 --> 58:12.529
is the most gruelling

58:12.614 --> 58:14.446
and demanding period...

58:14.741 --> 58:16.573
Why are they breaking
our mirrors like that?

58:16.702 --> 58:17.988
In any nun's life.

58:21.206 --> 58:25.621
It is then when the strength
of your so-called vocations

58:25.711 --> 58:29.125
will be tested to their limits.

58:30.215 --> 58:33.674
It's also about
learning to be perfect.

58:35.679 --> 58:39.593
Because, and I think
you'd all agree,

58:39.683 --> 58:42.801
our Saviour deserves no less

58:42.894 --> 58:46.012
from each one of you
than a perfect wife.

58:46.982 --> 58:52.228
So, once a week, we will
be meeting in this room

58:52.320 --> 58:55.529
for an exercise called
"Chapter of Faults."

58:56.408 --> 58:58.616
And one thing I can assure you,

58:59.870 --> 59:03.989
we do not leave until the
chapter is finished.

59:04.416 --> 59:08.660
So... You, Sister.

59:10.255 --> 59:12.292
Me? Evelyn.

59:13.216 --> 59:14.798
I'm Sister Evelyn.

59:15.594 --> 59:17.711
Come to the centre
of the room, please.

59:31.693 --> 59:33.525
Now...

59:33.862 --> 59:36.195
I want you to think for a moment,

59:37.699 --> 59:42.034
and then I want you
to carefully list

59:42.120 --> 59:45.363
every single fault

59:45.499 --> 59:48.367
you're aware of in yourself.

59:52.506 --> 59:54.088
I'm sorry, what?

59:54.382 --> 59:56.419
What don't you understand?

59:57.761 --> 59:59.172
Are you perfect?

01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:02.593
No.

01:00:02.682 --> 01:00:04.719
I don't know...

01:00:05.477 --> 01:00:06.684
What do you mean?

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:10.104
Are you a perfect person,
a perfect human being?

01:00:10.857 --> 01:00:12.348
A perfect nun?

01:00:12.526 --> 01:00:15.269
No. Of course not.

01:00:15.487 --> 01:00:16.978
Wouldn't you like to be perfect?

01:00:19.825 --> 01:00:23.569
Don't you think you should
at least try to be perfect?

01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:26.572
Yes, if I could.

01:00:29.251 --> 01:00:33.541
So what do you think
stands in the way most

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:36.418
between you and perfection?

01:00:37.884 --> 01:00:39.170
My faults.

01:00:39.761 --> 01:00:41.047
Correct.

01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:45.966
Because there's really no way for
any of us to achieve perfection

01:00:46.059 --> 01:00:48.802
without first getting
rid of our faults.

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:50.056
I guess so.

01:00:50.564 --> 01:00:51.975
You guess what, Sister?

01:00:53.525 --> 01:00:57.144
Yes, Mother, I agree.

01:00:57.487 --> 01:00:59.900
All right. Let's hear it.

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:01.526
Let's hear your faults.

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:04.735
Well, I'm untidy.

01:01:05.912 --> 01:01:07.995
I mean, I am... I'm messy.

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:11.874
I feel like a slob, and...

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:15.662
I space out sometimes.

01:01:17.382 --> 01:01:18.382
I mean, in school, they...

01:01:18.466 --> 01:01:19.800
- All right.
- I can't. I really can't...

01:01:19.801 --> 01:01:21.591
Hold it. Hold. Hold. Hold.

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:22.919
Just a moment.

01:01:23.889 --> 01:01:28.805
Leaving clothes on the floor
and lack of concentration,

01:01:28.935 --> 01:01:30.642
or "spacing out," as you call it,

01:01:31.229 --> 01:01:34.393
while I agree these
are all weaknesses

01:01:34.394 --> 01:01:37.476
that you need to
know about yourself,

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:40.402
they're also quite superficial

01:01:40.488 --> 01:01:43.276
and won't get us very
far in this process.

01:01:44.826 --> 01:01:45.862
So...

01:01:48.121 --> 01:01:49.862
I want you to start again.

01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:52.323
And this time,

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:56.707
I want you to fully
examine your conscience

01:01:56.796 --> 01:02:01.632
and come up with a list of
things you do on a daily basis

01:02:01.718 --> 01:02:04.085
to fail our Lord Christ.

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:09.306
Ways that I fail...

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:14.433
Ways that I fail Christ.

01:02:16.441 --> 01:02:19.730
Well, there's a part of me

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:24.939
that thinks that I'm not
good enough to be here,

01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:28.405
that I don't deserve to be here.

01:02:29.037 --> 01:02:32.371
I want to be pure, and
I want to be good.

01:02:33.667 --> 01:02:35.329
But...

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:41.755
I don't know if that's who
I really am on the inside.

01:02:42.425 --> 01:02:44.166
Because...

01:02:45.095 --> 01:02:47.929
Sometimes my thoughts inside

01:02:48.014 --> 01:02:51.007
don't match the way I
act on the outside.

01:02:56.106 --> 01:03:01.568
And I just feel bad
and ugly inside.

01:03:08.118 --> 01:03:09.859
And I've let people down before.

01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:14.118
I've let my parents down,
my ma and my father,

01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:16.540
but I don't want to
let Him down, Mother.

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:19.835
I don't want to let Jesus down.

01:03:22.882 --> 01:03:27.092
And I just hope that He knows
that I can do better...

01:03:30.015 --> 01:03:31.722
If He'll let me.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:35.388
All right, Sister.
Very brave of you.

01:03:36.855 --> 01:03:38.141
And now for your penance,

01:03:38.231 --> 01:03:40.974
I'd like to assign you
ten rosaries next week.

01:03:41.693 --> 01:03:44.731
And I'd also like you to starve
yourself all day on Friday.

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:46.153
Thank you, Mother.

01:03:47.866 --> 01:03:49.653
Where are you going?

01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:58.032
I thought that I was done.

01:03:59.044 --> 01:04:01.502
Done? No one said you were done.

01:04:01.588 --> 01:04:03.045
Come back here.

01:04:14.726 --> 01:04:16.496
Now that Sister has
been brave enough

01:04:16.497 --> 01:04:18.219
to share some of her
faults with us,

01:04:18.313 --> 01:04:20.600
I'd like to open it up to the room

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:24.893
to help point out any
additional character flaws

01:04:24.986 --> 01:04:27.899
that they are aware
of in their Sister.

01:04:35.413 --> 01:04:36.529
Well, somebody say something.

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:38.410
We've already established
she's not perfect.

01:04:40.335 --> 01:04:42.247
- I saw her smile.
- What?

01:04:44.089 --> 01:04:47.423
Just now, when you said
she did a good job,

01:04:48.468 --> 01:04:50.050
I saw her smile.

01:04:50.929 --> 01:04:53.467
Like she was pleased with herself.

01:04:54.349 --> 01:04:56.215
Like it was all a joke to her.

01:04:57.769 --> 01:04:58.930
Is that true?

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:01.687
No.

01:05:01.773 --> 01:05:02.980
And how would she know

01:05:03.066 --> 01:05:04.773
if she hadn't broken
the custody of eyes?

01:05:04.859 --> 01:05:06.145
I didn't. You're vain.

01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:09.274
You did. You're a liar.
How else would she know?

01:05:09.364 --> 01:05:11.651
All right. That's enough.

01:05:14.786 --> 01:05:16.243
Sister, your turn is finished.

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:18.913
However, if that is true,

01:05:19.707 --> 01:05:23.200
and you had the nerve to mock
this process, it's pathetic.

01:05:23.628 --> 01:05:25.085
What sort of nun are
you going to be

01:05:25.171 --> 01:05:28.585
if you can't even stand a single
moment of self-reflection

01:05:28.675 --> 01:05:30.086
without gloating?

01:05:32.178 --> 01:05:33.919
So in addition to
your other penance,

01:05:34.013 --> 01:05:37.506
I would like you to use the
discipline on yourself.

01:05:40.228 --> 01:05:41.594
What?

01:05:57.370 --> 01:05:59.077
Was it that bad?

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:00.700
What do you think?

01:06:07.005 --> 01:06:09.088
You don't have to
stay here, you know.

01:06:09.174 --> 01:06:10.790
None of us do.

01:06:10.884 --> 01:06:12.420
You can leave
whenever you want to.

01:06:15.013 --> 01:06:16.504
And do what?

01:06:17.599 --> 01:06:21.183
You mean go home and tell
everyone and my parents

01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:22.976
that I failed at being a nun?

01:06:24.063 --> 01:06:26.726
- No, I can't do that.
- Sister Mary Grace did it.

01:06:27.525 --> 01:06:29.016
It's not the same.

01:06:30.278 --> 01:06:31.940
Sister, I'm...

01:06:34.491 --> 01:06:37.074
I don't think you're vain at all.

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:39.485
I didn't know.

01:06:40.288 --> 01:06:41.745
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:45.116
- I'm sorry, too.
- We're all vain.

01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:47.827
She's just teaching us
how to lose our vanity.

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:52.506
Sisters, I need your
attention, please.

01:06:53.968 --> 01:06:56.506
As of today, we have a new member.

01:06:56.596 --> 01:06:59.339
Sister Gabrielle Emanuel will
be joining our community.

01:06:59.724 --> 01:07:01.761
Sister Emanuel was
previously a member

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:05.310
of the Order of the Sisters
of Christ in New Hampshire.

01:07:05.396 --> 01:07:07.638
But as she felt the
culture of the Roses

01:07:07.732 --> 01:07:10.065
was more suited to
her religious needs,

01:07:10.151 --> 01:07:12.188
she has decided to transfer here.

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:14.820
She'll be joining us as
a first-year novice.

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:17.072
So let's make her feel welcome.

01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:23.616
I guess all my friends
are just back home,

01:07:23.706 --> 01:07:25.698
and they're doing a
bunch of teenage stuff.

01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:29.126
They're going to the
drive-in movies.

01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:32.421
And they're going roller-skating

01:07:32.507 --> 01:07:36.217
and watching the fireworks
on the Fourth of July,

01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:38.134
or they're going...

01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:39.803
They're going on dates with boys.

01:07:41.182 --> 01:07:44.391
- With boys.
- Yeah. I don't know, I...

01:07:46.604 --> 01:07:48.095
Even...

01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:52.224
Even what?

01:07:53.152 --> 01:07:54.393
You know.

01:07:56.406 --> 01:07:57.613
What?

01:07:58.866 --> 01:07:59.866
Sex.

01:08:03.746 --> 01:08:06.284
Come on. You can't say that you've
never thought about it before.

01:08:06.374 --> 01:08:07.660
Everybody does.

01:08:08.209 --> 01:08:11.202
Even nuns do, they just
don't ever talk about it.

01:08:13.256 --> 01:08:15.168
How do you know that?

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:18.466
Because it's normal.

01:08:19.679 --> 01:08:21.716
It's more normal than you think.

01:08:25.225 --> 01:08:28.685
I don't really think about it.

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:32.229
So, you never even kissed a
boy before you came here,

01:08:32.317 --> 01:08:33.728
nothing like that?

01:08:40.533 --> 01:08:42.194
Have you?

01:08:43.703 --> 01:08:46.069
Yeah. Only once, though.

01:08:46.163 --> 01:08:48.781
Wait, don't tell all the other
Sisters, though, please.

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:51.328
- I won't.
- Okay.

01:08:53.671 --> 01:08:58.541
"Let him kiss me with the
kisses of his mouth,

01:08:58.635 --> 01:09:02.174
"for your love is
better than wine.

01:09:03.221 --> 01:09:06.636
"Your anointing oils are fragrant.

01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:10.932
"Your name is oil
poured out on me.

01:09:11.898 --> 01:09:15.983
"Therefore, virgins love you."

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:27.702
Sister Cathleen.

01:09:43.888 --> 01:09:47.256
I wish I could be more loved back.

01:09:50.435 --> 01:09:51.551
I wish I knew for sure...

01:09:53.898 --> 01:09:55.855
I wish we all knew for sure

01:09:57.902 --> 01:10:01.066
that He really loves us
as much as we love Him.

01:10:03.491 --> 01:10:06.074
I just wish I could feel it more.

01:10:08.913 --> 01:10:12.281
Don't wish for things
you shouldn't, Sister.

01:13:01.085 --> 01:13:03.543
For it is in giving
that we receive,

01:13:03.629 --> 01:13:06.713
and in pardoning, that we are
pardoned, and in dying...

01:13:06.799 --> 01:13:09.758
Excuse me, Mother. The
Archbishop is here to see you.

01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:11.843
The Archbishop.

01:13:28.487 --> 01:13:30.479
Good afternoon, Mother.

01:13:32.742 --> 01:13:33.949
Go ahead, sit.

01:13:34.952 --> 01:13:36.864
Let me get you some tea.

01:13:37.455 --> 01:13:39.947
- No, thank you.
- A little drop won't hurt you.

01:13:40.041 --> 01:13:41.873
So, how are you, Marie?

01:13:42.501 --> 01:13:44.493
You seem a little bit on edge.

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:46.751
Perhaps it's because
I haven't been

01:13:46.752 --> 01:13:48.631
in the company of a
man for a while.

01:13:48.716 --> 01:13:50.082
It's unusual for me.

01:13:52.803 --> 01:13:55.341
- Do you know why I'm here?
- No, I don't.

01:13:55.890 --> 01:13:59.099
- You have no idea why I'm here?
- No, I honestly do not.

01:14:00.811 --> 01:14:03.398
Well, I've been hearing
a lot recently

01:14:03.399 --> 01:14:05.852
about how this Order,
in particular,

01:14:05.942 --> 01:14:07.729
is having some trouble embracing

01:14:07.818 --> 01:14:10.652
some of the changes that have
been put forth by Vatican II.

01:14:10.738 --> 01:14:12.900
Now, you tell me,
is that accurate?

01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:14.447
Accurate to a point.

01:14:15.159 --> 01:14:17.572
Some of the changes we've
adopted, others we haven't.

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:19.035
Great.

01:14:20.081 --> 01:14:21.242
You care to elaborate?

01:14:22.041 --> 01:14:26.251
The memos sent over from your
office used the word "suggestion"

01:14:26.337 --> 01:14:29.876
in regards to all these
changes we're supposed...

01:14:31.592 --> 01:14:33.584
Well, that's amusing.

01:14:33.678 --> 01:14:36.295
I think you're the only one
who missed the subtext there.

01:14:37.556 --> 01:14:39.889
You see, for most of us,

01:14:39.976 --> 01:14:42.582
the word "suggestion"
is understood

01:14:42.583 --> 01:14:44.971
as synonymous with "obligation."

01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:49.024
Perhaps I'm not all that
attuned to subtext.

01:14:49.944 --> 01:14:51.810
- My apologies.
- Of course.

01:14:51.904 --> 01:14:52.904
Are we done here?

01:14:52.905 --> 01:14:54.567
No, no, no. Sorry, we're not done.

01:14:55.574 --> 01:14:59.033
Why don't you tell me

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.453
what exactly you have the
most difficulty with?

01:15:01.539 --> 01:15:03.451
Just lay it all out for me.

01:15:03.541 --> 01:15:04.748
I have no difficulty.

01:15:05.042 --> 01:15:07.284
I just happen to disagree
with it. All of it.

01:15:07.378 --> 01:15:09.415
Not to mention it's
a slap in the face

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:11.667
that the Sisters weren't given
any voice in the matter.

01:15:11.757 --> 01:15:14.044
You honestly expected them to have
their own voice, the Sisters?

01:15:14.135 --> 01:15:15.797
We are a part of this church, too.

01:15:15.886 --> 01:15:18.048
Marie, Marie, that's
not how it works.

01:15:18.139 --> 01:15:19.812
I don't think you
really understand

01:15:19.813 --> 01:15:20.973
what this will do to us.

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:25.344
If we were to truly embrace
all these changes,

01:15:25.438 --> 01:15:29.182
it will ruin the very institution
of Catholic nuns as...

01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:40.534
Are you still encouraging all of
your novitiates and postulants

01:15:40.619 --> 01:15:44.784
to perform extreme acts
of penance on themselves?

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:50.127
All that old mediaeval stuff?
Because that's gotta stop.

01:15:50.212 --> 01:15:51.999
I never asked my girls
to do anything for God

01:15:52.089 --> 01:15:53.455
that I haven't done myself.

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:54.835
Like I said, gotta stop.

01:15:56.552 --> 01:15:58.919
As for the rest of
Rome's recommendations,

01:15:59.013 --> 01:16:01.596
I would just hope that you
can keep an open mind

01:16:01.682 --> 01:16:06.677
and try to see things as
part of the larger context.

01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:10.515
A theme of change, adaptation,
of spiritual evolution.

01:16:10.941 --> 01:16:15.936
Do me a favour, just open
your mind a little bit.

01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:20.862
Otherwise, I may have to "suggest"

01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:24.320
that we find a
replacement for you.

01:16:31.003 --> 01:16:36.215
I never ever, ever thought
that I would say this,

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:40.169
but there are times
where I question

01:16:41.722 --> 01:16:43.964
whether or not God is even real.

01:16:44.058 --> 01:16:46.846
And I know, I know
that's so horrible,

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:49.019
but what scares me to think is,

01:16:49.396 --> 01:16:53.015
what if He actually doesn't exist?

01:16:53.818 --> 01:16:56.026
What if He's just something
that we all made up one day

01:16:56.112 --> 01:16:57.648
and everybody started
believing it?

01:16:59.824 --> 01:17:03.864
Everything that we do for Him and
what we put ourselves through,

01:17:03.953 --> 01:17:07.117
to only live in His image, but...

01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:12.413
But are we spreading any sort of
love in here or in the world,

01:17:12.545 --> 01:17:14.002
or any kindness, or...

01:17:14.088 --> 01:17:17.252
Or are we even getting
to know God more?

01:17:18.259 --> 01:17:20.672
And if it ever turned out

01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:24.884
that God didn't really exist...

01:17:25.766 --> 01:17:27.723
Then who would we all
be doing this for?

01:17:30.896 --> 01:17:32.762
Sister, you come in
here week after week

01:17:32.857 --> 01:17:36.476
with the same
ridiculous confession

01:17:36.569 --> 01:17:39.437
about your wavering spirituality.

01:17:41.407 --> 01:17:43.444
Frankly, it's grown tiresome.

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:48.950
Your utter spiritual wretchedness.

01:17:51.417 --> 01:17:55.081
So, for your penance, I'm
assigning you no penance.

01:17:57.006 --> 01:17:58.338
Don't bother.

01:18:03.345 --> 01:18:04.756
Excuse.

01:18:27.077 --> 01:18:31.321
I just don't understand who she
is or what she's doing here.

01:18:31.415 --> 01:18:34.908
Apparently, the SOCs weren't
strict enough for her.

01:18:35.461 --> 01:18:38.420
I guess she came here for all
the extra self-punishment.

01:18:39.173 --> 01:18:40.505
Really?

01:18:42.343 --> 01:18:44.551
She really thinks she's that holy?

01:19:17.795 --> 01:19:19.331
You can come in now.

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:26.835
What did you want to see me for?

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:32.633
I was wondering if I could
borrow the discipline?

01:19:33.185 --> 01:19:35.142
Just for tonight, please?

01:19:35.938 --> 01:19:36.938
Discipline?

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:39.222
What did you do?

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:43.644
If it's okay with you, I
would rather not say.

01:19:43.737 --> 01:19:46.275
- It's not okay.
- No.

01:19:46.365 --> 01:19:48.152
I can't just give it
to you without knowing

01:19:48.242 --> 01:19:50.450
what you need it for
first. You know that.

01:19:51.370 --> 01:19:53.157
Yeah, of course. I...

01:19:57.626 --> 01:20:00.164
I broke grand silence
twice this week.

01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:01.836
And...

01:20:03.424 --> 01:20:05.256
I was uncharitable
to one of my Sisters

01:20:05.342 --> 01:20:07.004
when I didn't mean to be.

01:20:07.761 --> 01:20:09.252
That's all.

01:20:10.055 --> 01:20:12.763
That's what you want to
punish yourself for?

01:20:14.977 --> 01:20:16.388
Honestly?

01:20:20.607 --> 01:20:21.643
Yes.

01:20:38.751 --> 01:20:40.492
Thank you, Mother.

01:22:12.511 --> 01:22:16.130
Excuse me, Sister. Your
mother's here to see you.

01:22:17.641 --> 01:22:20.509
What do you mean, why?
It's not visiting day.

01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:35.823
It's okay. Reverend Mother said
you can use the other door today.

01:22:43.917 --> 01:22:45.033
Hi, my love.

01:22:47.588 --> 01:22:49.044
Is there some place
we could talk? I

01:22:49.045 --> 01:22:50.422
have something I have to tell you.

01:22:50.924 --> 01:22:52.005
She already told me.

01:22:56.889 --> 01:22:58.425
Yeah. So, I guess no one...

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:01.174
No one knew how sick he was,

01:23:01.268 --> 01:23:03.305
and I know he wasn't the
best father, but I just...

01:23:04.104 --> 01:23:05.811
I didn't want you to be alone.

01:23:12.112 --> 01:23:13.728
Okay, I don't...

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:15.654
I came here to tell
you your dad died,

01:23:15.741 --> 01:23:17.152
and now you hear it
from somebody else?

01:23:17.242 --> 01:23:19.074
I don't understand
what's going on.

01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:21.532
I'm sorry you're upset, Mum.

01:23:22.372 --> 01:23:23.988
What the hell is going on here?

01:23:24.166 --> 01:23:26.283
And why does it look like
you've lost a bunch of weight?

01:23:26.376 --> 01:23:28.288
I really haven't lost very
much weight. I'm fine.

01:23:28.378 --> 01:23:29.594
You have lost some
weight, Cathleen.

01:23:29.595 --> 01:23:30.745
So, how much weight have you lost?

01:23:32.925 --> 01:23:34.485
What's going on, they
don't feed you in here?

01:23:34.493 --> 01:23:36.127
- You're not allowed to eat?
- No, I'm fine, okay?

01:23:36.128 --> 01:23:37.453
- Let me look at you.
- I'm fine, okay?

01:23:37.454 --> 01:23:39.371
- Let me look at you, Cathleen.
- I'm sorry. I have to go.

01:23:39.372 --> 01:23:40.372
Sorry to hear about Dad.

01:23:40.373 --> 01:23:41.940
I'll pray that God meets
him at his grace, okay?

01:23:41.945 --> 01:23:43.531
- I really need to go.
- What do you mean, you have to go?

01:23:43.532 --> 01:23:45.166
- Don't go yet.
- I need to leave, I'm sorry, Mum.

01:23:45.171 --> 01:23:46.871
I've been driving for three
hours. Stop. Stop, stop.

01:23:46.873 --> 01:23:47.873
Cathleen? Cathleen.

01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:52.142
I'd like to thank you for
stopping in, Mrs Harris.

01:23:52.236 --> 01:23:53.602
I don't think we've
had the pleasure.

01:23:53.695 --> 01:23:56.108
Just wanna know what's going on
with my daughter, that's all.

01:23:56.657 --> 01:23:58.023
Going on with your daughter?

01:23:58.116 --> 01:23:59.778
- In what way?
- Look, Miss...

01:23:59.868 --> 01:24:01.029
Mother.

01:24:01.119 --> 01:24:02.119
Excuse me?

01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:04.533
It's "Mother." Or
"Reverend Mother."

01:24:04.623 --> 01:24:07.536
I'm not a "Miss," or a "Missus"
either, for that matter.

01:24:07.626 --> 01:24:09.913
Lady, I am not calling you Mother.

01:24:11.547 --> 01:24:14.255
Mrs Harris, I understand you've
had a loss in the family.

01:24:14.341 --> 01:24:16.048
- And I would like to express...
- Save it.

01:24:16.343 --> 01:24:18.585
You know, I haven't seen my
daughter in over six months.

01:24:19.513 --> 01:24:21.300
And I came here today to
tell her about her dad,

01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:22.676
and I barely recognise her.

01:24:24.309 --> 01:24:26.926
She looks completely different,
like she's lost 20 pounds.

01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:29.478
I wanna know what you're
doing to her in here.

01:24:29.815 --> 01:24:31.272
What I'm doing?

01:24:31.942 --> 01:24:34.810
You're talking about her body,
which is a superficial topic.

01:24:34.903 --> 01:24:36.064
Are you blind?

01:24:38.115 --> 01:24:39.572
Have you seen her lately?

01:24:39.658 --> 01:24:41.445
She looks like she's dying.

01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:43.484
Just, please, calm down.

01:24:43.579 --> 01:24:46.196
I said, I wanna know
what's going on in here.

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:51.250
Honestly, Mrs Harris,
with all due respect,

01:24:52.754 --> 01:24:55.997
in a sense, you did bring
your daughter here to die.

01:24:56.842 --> 01:24:59.004
You brought her here to
die to the outside world

01:24:59.094 --> 01:25:01.256
and be born again
in Christ's love.

01:25:01.805 --> 01:25:04.468
It's a process. She's
simply going through it.

01:25:04.558 --> 01:25:05.674
That's all.

01:25:07.603 --> 01:25:08.639
For what it's worth,

01:25:08.729 --> 01:25:10.595
I do understand how
difficult it can be

01:25:10.689 --> 01:25:12.476
for a parent to give
their child to God.

01:25:12.691 --> 01:25:15.104
And that's because you
have children of your own?

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:16.441
No, I don't,

01:25:17.112 --> 01:25:18.728
but neither do you any more.

01:25:26.705 --> 01:25:27.991
Okay. Well...

01:25:29.499 --> 01:25:30.785
Just so you know,

01:25:31.209 --> 01:25:32.575
and with all due respect to you,

01:25:32.669 --> 01:25:34.786
Miss whatever the fuck
you want to be called,

01:25:36.548 --> 01:25:38.039
I didn't bring my daughter here.

01:25:39.509 --> 01:25:41.171
I didn't bring her here at all.

01:25:41.261 --> 01:25:44.004
But if I ever come here and
see her like this again,

01:25:44.097 --> 01:25:46.510
I will take her out of here.

01:26:34.356 --> 01:26:36.018
Are you all right,
Sister Cathleen?

01:27:30.912 --> 01:27:32.494
Reverend Mother...

01:27:34.291 --> 01:27:35.657
She asked me to check on you.

01:27:37.377 --> 01:27:39.289
And we don't have to sign.
It's not grand silence yet.

01:27:41.548 --> 01:27:43.005
They asked me to
bring soup for you.

01:27:58.523 --> 01:27:59.730
Thank you.

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:15.196
So you were at the SOCs, right?

01:28:18.293 --> 01:28:19.627
What happened, you
didn't like it there?

01:28:25.175 --> 01:28:27.132
It's not that I didn't
like it, it's just...

01:28:28.553 --> 01:28:29.760
I don't know, I just thought

01:28:31.056 --> 01:28:32.718
being a Rose would
be better for me.

01:28:33.558 --> 01:28:34.674
I thought it would be easier.

01:28:36.019 --> 01:28:37.601
Isn't it so much stricter here?

01:28:39.773 --> 01:28:42.891
Sometimes when things are
stricter, it makes them easier.

01:28:44.110 --> 01:28:45.146
I wouldn't know.

01:28:46.905 --> 01:28:48.646
All I ever wanted
was to be a Rose.

01:28:49.366 --> 01:28:50.982
Seems to come so naturally to you.

01:28:51.910 --> 01:28:53.276
Sometimes, I guess.

01:28:53.370 --> 01:28:54.736
I just know that

01:28:57.374 --> 01:29:00.412
I want God's love

01:29:01.837 --> 01:29:05.376
and if being a good nun is what
it takes to deserve it, then...

01:29:05.841 --> 01:29:07.423
I admire your devotion.

01:29:08.635 --> 01:29:11.469
The passion you feel,
it seems real with you.

01:29:12.264 --> 01:29:14.005
Isn't it with you, too?

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:27.188
Sister Emanuel?

01:30:01.438 --> 01:30:04.055
Maybe it's a strange
question, but...

01:30:06.359 --> 01:30:07.770
Why'd you do it?

01:30:09.487 --> 01:30:14.073
I mean, why did you starve
yourself, make yourself sick?

01:30:17.454 --> 01:30:19.070
Did you do it for Christ?

01:30:26.296 --> 01:30:29.414
I'm sorry, it's... It's
really not my place to ask.

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:32.333
You can turn around.

01:30:43.563 --> 01:30:46.306
I thought I was doing
it for Christ.

01:30:47.943 --> 01:30:48.979
Or,

01:30:50.987 --> 01:30:53.149
just to be a better nun,

01:30:55.367 --> 01:30:57.859
but maybe I also thought that

01:31:01.414 --> 01:31:03.952
if I made myself
starve on the outside,

01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:06.245
I wouldn't feel myself

01:31:08.588 --> 01:31:10.204
starving as much on the inside.

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:13.132
What are you starving for?

01:31:16.554 --> 01:31:17.795
I don't know.

01:31:37.033 --> 01:31:38.490
"Let not your heart be troubled.

01:31:40.954 --> 01:31:43.571
"You believe in God.
Believe also in me.

01:31:44.582 --> 01:31:46.699
"In my Father's house,
there are many rooms.

01:31:47.544 --> 01:31:48.625
"Were it not so,

01:31:48.712 --> 01:31:50.578
- "I should have told you..."
- Will you please stop?

01:31:51.589 --> 01:31:53.376
I'm sorry.

01:31:54.009 --> 01:31:55.966
I'm sorry, did I do
something wrong?

01:32:01.433 --> 01:32:02.433
I don't understand.

01:32:10.984 --> 01:32:13.818
You can just keep reading. Please
go back to reading, please.

01:32:16.489 --> 01:32:17.855
Just read. I'm sorry.

01:33:16.007 --> 01:33:18.590
No, that was a mistake. I'm sorry.

01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:19.960
- It's my fault.
- That was my fault.

01:33:19.969 --> 01:33:20.969
I'm sorry. That was a mistake.

01:33:21.054 --> 01:33:23.387
- I'm sorry, it was my fault.
- No, it's me. I have to go.

01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:27.136
So stupid of...

01:33:49.707 --> 01:33:52.950
Lord, make me an
instrument of thy peace.

01:33:53.545 --> 01:33:55.878
Where there is hatred,
let me sow love,

01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:58.877
where there is injury, pardon,

01:33:59.384 --> 01:34:01.000
where there is doubt, faith,

01:34:02.262 --> 01:34:03.969
where there is despair, hope,

01:34:04.514 --> 01:34:06.096
where there is sadness, joy,

01:34:06.558 --> 01:34:08.094
where there is darkness, light.

01:34:08.601 --> 01:34:10.137
Oh, Divine Master,

01:34:10.436 --> 01:34:13.679
grant that I may not so much seek
to be consoled as to console,

01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:18.143
to be understood as to understand,
to be loved as to love.

01:34:20.530 --> 01:34:22.772
Love, love, love.

01:34:23.449 --> 01:34:24.656
Love.

01:34:58.943 --> 01:35:00.184
Sisters.

01:35:00.778 --> 01:35:02.144
I have an announcement.

01:35:03.072 --> 01:35:05.985
I apologise that this
has taken so long,

01:35:07.076 --> 01:35:09.864
but there's something
very important

01:35:09.954 --> 01:35:12.788
that I've been meaning
to inform you of.

01:35:13.458 --> 01:35:15.541
I'm sure, by now,

01:35:15.627 --> 01:35:19.416
at least a few of you have heard
of something called Vatican II.

01:35:20.465 --> 01:35:22.001
In a nutshell,

01:35:22.842 --> 01:35:25.550
there's been a series
of meetings in Rome

01:35:26.846 --> 01:35:28.587
over the past three years.

01:35:30.225 --> 01:35:32.337
These meetings have
been principally

01:35:32.338 --> 01:35:33.764
concerned with revisions

01:35:33.853 --> 01:35:35.515
that the Pope and others

01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:39.769
felt necessary to
ensure the survival

01:35:41.194 --> 01:35:42.401
of our Church.

01:35:45.865 --> 01:35:50.360
I, myself, couldn't
be more pleased

01:35:50.453 --> 01:35:52.570
with the results of Vatican II.

01:35:53.998 --> 01:35:59.790
Pope John XXIII was nothing
short of a visionary

01:35:59.879 --> 01:36:01.745
in terms of...

01:36:04.884 --> 01:36:06.500
In terms...

01:36:09.472 --> 01:36:11.054
Well, let's not belabour it.

01:36:11.724 --> 01:36:16.640
I will read this letter
from the Archdiocese.

01:36:17.355 --> 01:36:18.766
A letter,

01:36:19.983 --> 01:36:22.270
regarding certain reforms

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:26.149
which we will be
adopting immediately.

01:36:30.451 --> 01:36:32.864
"From now on, please be advised

01:36:32.954 --> 01:36:35.314
"that priests are
no longer required

01:36:35.315 --> 01:36:37.164
to read the liturgy in Latin

01:36:37.458 --> 01:36:40.747
"and should face the
congregation during Mass.

01:36:42.839 --> 01:36:46.082
"All Catholics are further
encouraged to embrace

01:36:46.384 --> 01:36:49.502
"the idea of full
religious tolerance.

01:36:49.595 --> 01:36:53.214
"While we may not share the
same beliefs as others,

01:36:53.308 --> 01:36:55.391
"we will honour and respect

01:36:55.476 --> 01:36:59.595
"each and every individual's
belief as their own.

01:37:00.648 --> 01:37:04.688
"Please be advised
also that all nuns

01:37:04.777 --> 01:37:08.487
"and women religious,
cloistered and non-cloistered,

01:37:10.199 --> 01:37:14.409
"are no longer required to
wear the traditional habit

01:37:15.288 --> 01:37:18.952
"as a symbol of their
lifelong matrimony to Christ.

01:37:19.792 --> 01:37:20.908
"In fact,

01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:25.663
"they are now free to
wear what they want.

01:37:28.092 --> 01:37:31.176
"Regarding the culture of
more extreme abnegation

01:37:31.262 --> 01:37:33.624
"and self-punishment
still prevalent

01:37:33.625 --> 01:37:35.347
in many communities today,

01:37:36.434 --> 01:37:38.972
"please be advised that
according to the Council,

01:37:39.062 --> 01:37:41.054
"this is no longer understood

01:37:42.899 --> 01:37:45.186
"to be the appropriate
path to follow

01:37:45.276 --> 01:37:48.144
"for all those seeking
greater union with Christ.

01:37:48.905 --> 01:37:50.771
"It is no longer acceptable

01:37:50.865 --> 01:37:54.609
"to view any acts of
extreme sacrifice

01:37:55.912 --> 01:37:57.699
"as an act of love.

01:37:58.539 --> 01:37:59.746
"Finally,

01:38:01.751 --> 01:38:03.208
"from here forward,

01:38:03.461 --> 01:38:08.422
"in the eyes of both the
Holy Church and God,

01:38:10.635 --> 01:38:13.469
"the status of all nuns
shall be reduced as equal

01:38:13.554 --> 01:38:18.800
"to that of any regular
practising Catholic.

01:38:18.893 --> 01:38:23.012
"While the choice to enter the
convent remains one's own,

01:38:23.898 --> 01:38:26.561
"this does not necessarily
make nuns any more

01:38:28.903 --> 01:38:31.441
"beloved or special

01:38:32.657 --> 01:38:34.398
"in the eyes of God."

01:38:38.579 --> 01:38:42.664
I am deeply sorry, Sisters.

01:38:43.709 --> 01:38:44.870
Have a pleasant day.

01:39:06.524 --> 01:39:08.231
Where are you?

01:39:14.031 --> 01:39:18.901
I can feel you, right
next to me, for so long.

01:39:19.454 --> 01:39:20.661
With me

01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:26.283
all that time, my darling husband.

01:39:28.796 --> 01:39:31.789
And now you've abandoned me.

01:39:39.599 --> 01:39:41.090
And you hoped

01:39:42.351 --> 01:39:44.434
that I would lose faith in you?

01:39:47.190 --> 01:39:51.525
You imagined that I would
just walk out those gates?

01:39:55.823 --> 01:39:57.359
I cannot.

01:40:01.162 --> 01:40:02.698
I made a commitment

01:40:04.665 --> 01:40:06.156
forty years ago.

01:40:08.377 --> 01:40:12.337
And even if you choose to turn
your light from me forever...

01:40:17.553 --> 01:40:19.135
I am yours.

01:40:23.809 --> 01:40:25.766
Oh, my darling husband.

01:40:59.178 --> 01:41:00.464
You can't be here.

01:41:08.521 --> 01:41:09.521
Okay.

01:41:19.865 --> 01:41:20.865
Okay.

01:41:35.047 --> 01:41:36.208
It's okay.

01:42:06.871 --> 01:42:08.237
Do you remember...

01:42:14.086 --> 01:42:16.453
Do you remember when you asked
what I was starving for?

01:42:24.597 --> 01:42:25.929
I just want to be comforted.

01:42:28.976 --> 01:42:31.093
Please, will you just
comfort me? Please?

01:42:37.318 --> 01:42:38.918
Please, will you just...
Please, will you just...

01:42:39.278 --> 01:42:40.485
Will you, please? Just...

01:42:49.330 --> 01:42:51.868
Please, will you just comfort
me? Please, please, please.

01:42:54.794 --> 01:42:58.378
Please, will you just comfort me?
Please, will you just comfort me?

01:43:01.509 --> 01:43:02.875
I can't.

01:43:05.971 --> 01:43:09.055
Please, I just want to be
comforted. Please, please, please.

01:43:12.395 --> 01:43:13.602
Please.

01:43:19.610 --> 01:43:21.101
- Okay.
- Please comfort me.

01:43:21.195 --> 01:43:23.482
- I will. I will comfort you.
- Please, please, please.

01:43:23.572 --> 01:43:24.813
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:43:39.964 --> 01:43:41.580
Please, please, please.

01:43:41.674 --> 01:43:45.588
Okay. Okay. Stop talking.

01:43:50.349 --> 01:43:51.349
Please.

01:44:03.946 --> 01:44:05.687
Please, just comfort
me. Please, please.

01:44:07.700 --> 01:44:08.736
Please.

01:44:28.888 --> 01:44:30.254
- Please, please.
- Okay, okay.

01:44:30.347 --> 01:44:32.589
- Please, please.
- Okay, okay.

01:44:36.771 --> 01:44:37.887
Comfort me.

01:44:43.903 --> 01:44:45.610
I take it you're feeling better?

01:44:49.533 --> 01:44:52.651
Yes. I am.

01:44:53.412 --> 01:44:54.619
Thank you.

01:44:55.998 --> 01:44:58.185
I appreciate the
devotion you showed,

01:44:58.186 --> 01:44:59.912
starving yourself for Christ.

01:45:00.795 --> 01:45:01.876
Thank you, Mother.

01:45:05.382 --> 01:45:07.169
So, a few bumps here and there,

01:45:07.259 --> 01:45:10.297
but mostly you have been
exceptional during your training.

01:45:11.931 --> 01:45:14.093
I believe you belong
here with us, Sister.

01:45:15.351 --> 01:45:16.808
Doesn't that make you happy?

01:45:18.062 --> 01:45:19.143
Yes.

01:45:20.481 --> 01:45:21.688
Of course.

01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:24.061
Of course I'm happy.

01:45:30.032 --> 01:45:33.446
I don't know how much you've
heard about this Vatican II?

01:45:35.454 --> 01:45:36.865
Not much,

01:45:36.956 --> 01:45:38.572
just little things I've
heard here and there

01:45:38.666 --> 01:45:39.998
from some of the others.

01:45:43.879 --> 01:45:45.461
When I first came here...

01:45:47.925 --> 01:45:51.885
When I first came to this
convent, I had nothing.

01:45:55.266 --> 01:45:58.759
No home, no family, nothing.

01:46:02.606 --> 01:46:06.270
The Church is the only
thing that ever held me.

01:46:07.528 --> 01:46:08.939
It gave me my work,

01:46:10.072 --> 01:46:11.279
my community,

01:46:12.032 --> 01:46:13.364
even my identity.

01:46:15.452 --> 01:46:17.999
And now Vatican II is trying to

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:21.039
invalidate all that,
for all of us.

01:46:23.168 --> 01:46:25.000
Saying none of it matters.

01:46:27.381 --> 01:46:28.838
So, my question is,

01:46:29.884 --> 01:46:32.877
what is it that really
does still matter?

01:46:55.242 --> 01:46:56.483
Sister?

01:47:05.294 --> 01:47:08.207
So much has changed since
we were postulants.

01:47:10.633 --> 01:47:13.341
I know that when I
first had my vocation,

01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:15.836
that it was real.

01:47:16.472 --> 01:47:17.929
It was a real vocation.

01:47:19.808 --> 01:47:23.051
Really, truly, His
voice calling to me.

01:47:29.735 --> 01:47:31.897
I just don't know sometimes

01:47:31.987 --> 01:47:34.525
if that was what He was
really calling me for.

01:47:36.659 --> 01:47:38.867
Maybe He wants
something else for me.

01:47:41.163 --> 01:47:43.701
Maybe He never meant for
me to be a nun at all...

01:47:48.087 --> 01:47:51.125
Just wants me to be happy
and be good to others.

01:47:56.345 --> 01:47:57.711
Or maybe not.

01:48:04.019 --> 01:48:06.406
For your penance,
I'd like you to say

01:48:06.407 --> 01:48:08.605
three extra Hail Marys at bedtime.

01:48:09.191 --> 01:48:10.523
You can do it quickly
if you'd like.

01:48:16.323 --> 01:48:17.655
Sister Cathleen.

01:48:19.076 --> 01:48:20.692
Come to the centre
of the room, please.

01:48:30.295 --> 01:48:32.912
You have any accusations
you'd like to share with us?

01:48:35.801 --> 01:48:36.837
Faults?

01:48:42.391 --> 01:48:43.882
- Do you hear me, Sister?
- Yes.

01:48:51.483 --> 01:48:52.940
I want to accuse myself.

01:49:00.951 --> 01:49:02.487
I accuse myself of
having feelings.

01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:05.991
"Feelings"?

01:49:08.208 --> 01:49:10.165
Feelings I'm not sure
I'm supposed to have.

01:49:13.672 --> 01:49:15.379
Like wanting to be
with another person

01:49:20.596 --> 01:49:21.882
in a way that made me

01:49:23.932 --> 01:49:24.932
feel...

01:49:25.017 --> 01:49:26.428
Feel what?

01:49:28.395 --> 01:49:29.395
Comforted.

01:49:31.607 --> 01:49:32.814
Wanted.

01:49:34.359 --> 01:49:35.475
Loved.

01:49:37.571 --> 01:49:38.937
I wanted someone to touch me.

01:49:41.158 --> 01:49:42.375
I wanted someone to make me feel

01:49:42.376 --> 01:49:43.821
something more than
God can give me.

01:49:43.911 --> 01:49:45.447
More than God can give you?

01:49:46.246 --> 01:49:47.362
What do you mean?

01:49:47.635 --> 01:49:48.635
Explain yourself.

01:49:48.636 --> 01:49:50.456
I don't know how
to explain myself.

01:49:53.587 --> 01:49:55.254
I'm accusing myself of being
intimate with someone.

01:49:55.506 --> 01:49:57.168
- Intimate?
- With another Sister.

01:49:58.801 --> 01:50:00.008
Feeling love for her.

01:50:02.387 --> 01:50:04.504
And I don't think it was a sin.
I don't think it was a sin.

01:50:04.598 --> 01:50:07.557
Because it didn't feel like a sin.
It felt like I'm supposed to feel.

01:50:08.352 --> 01:50:09.593
A particular friendship?

01:50:10.854 --> 01:50:12.186
With someone in this room?

01:50:14.900 --> 01:50:16.357
- Who?
- I'm not going to say, Mother.

01:50:16.443 --> 01:50:17.443
I did what you asked.

01:50:17.528 --> 01:50:20.271
I made my confession. Will
you just give me my penance?

01:50:20.489 --> 01:50:24.529
I want you to tell me exactly
what you did and with whom.

01:50:24.585 --> 01:50:26.119
No, I did what you asked,
I made my accusation.

01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:27.283
Will you just give me my penance?

01:50:27.284 --> 01:50:28.284
Do you want your penance?

01:50:28.288 --> 01:50:30.088
Yes, I want my penance. Please
just give me my penance.

01:50:30.089 --> 01:50:31.423
You want your penance, Cathleen?

01:50:31.425 --> 01:50:33.883
Yes, I just want my penance.
Please just give me my penance.

01:50:33.961 --> 01:50:35.418
You do? You want your penance?

01:50:36.213 --> 01:50:38.421
Yes, I just want my penance.
I want my penance, please.

01:50:38.507 --> 01:50:40.248
- Do you want your penance?
- Please, yes.

01:50:43.345 --> 01:50:44.756
Please give it to me.

01:50:45.430 --> 01:50:50.425
I want you to crawl
around this room

01:50:50.519 --> 01:50:55.014
and ask this group
for your penance.

01:50:55.107 --> 01:50:57.440
I just want my penance. Please,
I beg you. Please. Please.

01:50:58.402 --> 01:50:59.859
I'm begging you, please.

01:51:03.407 --> 01:51:04.818
I'm begging you.

01:51:08.036 --> 01:51:10.528
Please, I'm begging
you. Please, please.

01:51:14.710 --> 01:51:16.793
I'm begging you, please.

01:51:39.985 --> 01:51:41.942
I don't understand.
Where is everyone?

01:51:43.447 --> 01:51:44.528
Gone.

01:51:44.865 --> 01:51:46.401
Gone? What do you mean, "gone"?

01:51:47.117 --> 01:51:48.324
Didn't you hear?

01:51:49.119 --> 01:51:50.985
It's because of Vatican II.

01:51:53.498 --> 01:51:55.205
Now and forever.
God bless, Sister.

01:51:57.461 --> 01:52:00.044
You three are late.
Is everyone here now?

01:52:05.093 --> 01:52:08.461
Why are there only five dresses?
Where's Sister Emanuel?

01:52:08.555 --> 01:52:10.421
Sister Emanuel's dress will
not be needed any more

01:52:10.515 --> 01:52:11.722
because Sister Emanuel left.

01:52:12.267 --> 01:52:14.259
She's not going to be taking
vows with the rest of you.

01:52:14.353 --> 01:52:15.764
What do you mean, she
left? Where'd she go?

01:52:15.854 --> 01:52:17.436
I have no idea, she
just left. That's all.

01:52:17.814 --> 01:52:19.350
I guess she didn't want
to be a nun any more.

01:52:23.570 --> 01:52:25.411
I don't know if this is something

01:52:25.412 --> 01:52:27.530
that I need to figure
out on my own.

01:52:28.825 --> 01:52:30.361
I'll do whatever it takes.

01:52:32.204 --> 01:52:33.866
If you want me to
stay, then I'll stay.

01:52:38.669 --> 01:52:41.753
But I can't tell if that's
what you want any more.

01:52:41.880 --> 01:52:43.872
I can't hear you,
and I don't know.

01:54:12.346 --> 01:54:13.803
I pray and beseech thee

01:54:15.057 --> 01:54:16.548
that each of these dear pledges...

01:54:16.549 --> 01:54:17.595
Is he speaking English?

01:54:17.684 --> 01:54:19.016
Of Jesus and Mary,

01:54:19.686 --> 01:54:22.850
their being preserved
from all uncleanness.

01:54:23.231 --> 01:54:26.941
Thy may with spotless mind,
pure heart and a chaste body

01:54:27.986 --> 01:54:32.606
serve Jesus and Mary most
chastely all the days of my life.

01:54:32.699 --> 01:54:33.699
Amen.

01:54:39.539 --> 01:54:40.996
What is it you seek?

01:54:42.376 --> 01:54:45.164
I seek to take the vows

01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:50.791
of chastity, poverty
and obedience.

01:54:52.344 --> 01:54:53.630
To give my life

01:54:54.888 --> 01:54:57.005
to God for eternity.

01:54:58.100 --> 01:55:03.812
To be married forever to
our Lord Jesus Christ.

01:55:05.690 --> 01:55:09.149
Bride of Christ, you
are now professed.

01:55:27.712 --> 01:55:29.578
What is it you desire?

01:55:34.302 --> 01:55:35.543
With the help of God,

01:55:37.222 --> 01:55:39.134
I have come to know
in this community

01:55:41.143 --> 01:55:43.681
both the difficulty and joy

01:55:44.771 --> 01:55:46.888
of a life completely
devoted to Him.

01:55:50.485 --> 01:55:53.899
My desire is to make
permanent profession

01:55:55.407 --> 01:55:56.989
within this community

01:55:59.411 --> 01:56:01.448
and to wear the holy
habit of the Rose.

01:56:02.164 --> 01:56:03.905
And what is it you seek?

01:56:19.764 --> 01:56:20.880
I seek...

01:56:22.809 --> 01:56:24.050
What do I seek?

01:56:28.899 --> 01:56:30.185
What do I seek?

01:56:42.704 --> 01:56:43.945
I seek...

01:56:47.459 --> 01:56:48.791
I seek something more.
