00:14.715 --> 00:17.551
**

00:24.625 --> 00:26.327
**

00:29.630 --> 00:31.265
What are you doing here
so early?

00:31.265 --> 00:32.333
I thought you weren't
working until later.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.668
I was waiting for you.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.537
Why?

00:43.811 --> 00:45.513
Whoa.

00:45.513 --> 00:47.681
That didn't feel like
a "just friends" kiss.

00:47.681 --> 00:49.583
It wasn't.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.453
I don't understand.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.523
I don't either.

01:00.928 --> 01:02.530
**

01:13.641 --> 01:15.576
This is it.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.845
142 Sycamore.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.347
You think she's in there?

01:22.483 --> 01:24.017
Eh, you wouldn't understand.

01:25.519 --> 01:28.889
You've had those parts removed.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.158
All right.

01:31.892 --> 01:33.294
Wish me luck.

01:54.248 --> 01:55.549
Hello?

01:59.687 --> 02:00.921
Hello?

02:00.921 --> 02:02.190
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.991
I'm sorry to disturb you.

02:03.991 --> 02:06.194
I'm looking for Sun Hi Lee.

02:06.194 --> 02:07.828
I was told that she lives here.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.263
Oh, she did.

02:09.263 --> 02:10.964
I'm sorry.
My information is old.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.234
Do you have any idea where
she might have moved to?

02:13.234 --> 02:17.104
Oh, she died two years ago
of cancer.

02:20.408 --> 02:22.210
Um, did you know her well?

02:22.210 --> 02:25.246
She was my mother-in-law.
Yeah.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.847
Sun Hi had a son.
Wow. Okay, okay.

02:26.847 --> 02:29.250
- Who are you again?
- I'm sorry. I'm Sam Myers.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.451
I'm an old friend.

02:30.451 --> 02:31.485
Who is it, honey?

02:31.485 --> 02:34.222
Someone who knew your mom.

02:34.222 --> 02:36.857
Hi, I'm Peter Lee.
Who are you?

02:36.857 --> 02:37.825
Sam Myers.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.293
How do you know my mother?

02:39.293 --> 02:43.231
We were very friendly
a long time ago in Korea.

02:43.231 --> 02:45.466
Ah. Army?

02:45.466 --> 02:48.001
Quartermaster server,
Second Infantry.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.571
I was born there.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.343
Is that right?

02:55.343 --> 02:57.978
You have no trace of an accent.

02:57.978 --> 03:00.781
I grew up on an army base.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.883
Oh.

03:02.883 --> 03:05.953
And then we moved to the States
when I was seven.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.589
You say, when you were seven?

03:08.589 --> 03:10.258
Yeah.

03:10.258 --> 03:11.925
That's when you
and your mom moved here.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.060
That was '63, right?

03:13.060 --> 03:15.996
That's right.

03:15.996 --> 03:19.967
So you were seven,
so then you were born in '56.

03:19.967 --> 03:21.435
Yeah.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.271
'Cause I didn't ship out
until '53,

03:23.271 --> 03:25.873
and then--

03:25.873 --> 03:30.278
My parents split in '65,
after my dad retired
from the army.

03:30.278 --> 03:32.280
He lives in Phoenix.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.150
Hi, I'm Sam.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.720
Hi. Peter.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.691
It was really fun.

03:43.691 --> 03:46.560
I'd never been
to a comedy show before,

03:46.560 --> 03:49.497
and Margot was hysterical.

03:49.497 --> 03:51.599
Did you guys do anything after?

03:51.599 --> 03:54.968
Um, yeah, we hung out
backstage, had a drink.

03:54.968 --> 03:58.539
- And?
- And that's it.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.674
You didn't go back
to her place?

04:00.674 --> 04:04.044
Well, she asked me to,
but I just couldn't.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.479
Not on a second date.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.815
I mean,
I know it's 1986 and all,

04:07.815 --> 04:10.117
but I'm just not
that kind of girl.

04:10.117 --> 04:11.319
Do you know,

04:11.319 --> 04:13.086
when I was dating Sam,

04:13.086 --> 04:16.390
I think I dated him six months
before I would let him touch me

04:16.390 --> 04:17.658
down there?

04:17.658 --> 04:20.761
Well, it's okay
to take it slow.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.497
- You think?
- Of course.

04:25.165 --> 04:27.535
Okay. Here we go.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.337
Okay.

04:29.337 --> 04:32.673
Hello. I'm Judy Myers. Welcome.

04:32.673 --> 04:36.176
Judy, thank you.
I love it.

04:36.176 --> 04:37.878
I'm very interested.

04:37.878 --> 04:41.349
- You have my number.
- I will call you.

04:41.349 --> 04:42.850
Please do.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.963
Oh.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.665
This is her at the hospital?

04:57.665 --> 04:59.900
Right before she died.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.769
Pity.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.437
So young.

05:03.437 --> 05:05.238
Yeah.

05:05.238 --> 05:09.410
So she went back to her maiden
name after the divorce, huh?

05:09.410 --> 05:12.380
She was pretty pissed
at my dad.

05:12.380 --> 05:15.082
So he always had a temper.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.750
For sure.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.720
And by the way,
she went by Sunny,
not Sun Hi.

05:19.720 --> 05:23.290
She said it was easier
for Americans to understand.

05:23.290 --> 05:25.993
Sunny, huh?
That's nice.

05:27.395 --> 05:31.432
I like that. Apropos.

05:36.437 --> 05:39.039
Hey, uh, do you know CPR?

05:39.039 --> 05:40.841
No, why?

05:40.841 --> 05:44.111
Stu collapsed in the break room.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.780
How about working a TV camera?

05:46.780 --> 05:49.583
Yeah, yeah. Come on.
You're gonna learn. Come on.

05:50.684 --> 05:53.487
Okay, rack focus, rack focus.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.789
Stop doing that.
Just rack focus.

05:55.789 --> 05:58.058
Okay, better.
A little to the left.

05:58.058 --> 06:00.494
Just hold the camera like
you're holding a woman
or a wheelbarrow.

06:00.494 --> 06:02.195
You got the hang of it.
Good, good, good.

06:02.195 --> 06:05.933
There's no wrong way
to get turned on, Valerie.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.968
If your man goes wild
for duck waders,

06:07.968 --> 06:10.571
I say find the sexiest pair
you can,

06:10.571 --> 06:12.473
strap 'em on and go for it.

06:12.473 --> 06:15.008
Get some reactions.
Get those girls.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.710
Their reactions are terrible.
Go back to Rhonda.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.713
Our next caller is Ned
from Paramus.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.515
Ned, you're on the air.

06:21.515 --> 06:23.884
Hey, Rhonda.
Long-time viewer,
first-time caller.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.086
What's on your mind,
sweetheart?

06:26.086 --> 06:28.055
I just started dating
this amazing woman,

06:28.055 --> 06:30.758
who I've had a crush on for,
like, ever.

06:30.758 --> 06:33.193
And we made out a few times,

06:33.193 --> 06:34.227
and it's been incredible.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.796
Oh, so what's the problem?

06:35.796 --> 06:37.731
Well, she wants to cook me
dinner this Saturday

06:37.731 --> 06:39.332
when her mom's out of town,

06:39.332 --> 06:41.469
and we'll have the place
to ourselves,

06:41.469 --> 06:44.171
and I'm just worried
that she'll wanna have,

06:44.171 --> 06:46.840
you know, sex.

06:46.840 --> 06:50.077
Oh, worried because
your penis is small.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.812
What? No!

06:51.812 --> 06:53.781
-Oh, Rhonda.
- I don't think so.

06:53.781 --> 06:58.385
Worried because I don't have
a lot of, well, experience.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.554
Oh, are you a virgin?

07:00.554 --> 07:01.955
No, but...

07:01.955 --> 07:03.691
I haven't been with
a ton of women,

07:03.691 --> 07:05.526
just, like, a few.

07:05.526 --> 07:06.827
Two.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.496
Or I guess technically
one and a half.

07:08.496 --> 07:11.765
Anyway, I'm just afraid
that I'll disappoint her.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.667
I'm not really much
of an athlete.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.569
Okay, slow push on Rhonda.

07:15.569 --> 07:17.771
- I wanna hear this.
- It's called performance
anxiety,

07:17.771 --> 07:19.507
and it is very common
in young men.

07:19.507 --> 07:21.809
But you have nothing
to worry about.

07:21.809 --> 07:24.377
If this girl is a good person,

07:24.377 --> 07:26.213
who is worthy of your love,

07:26.213 --> 07:27.715
she'll be patient with you.

07:27.715 --> 07:30.083
Good advice, good advice.
Okay, three-shot now.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.519
Okay, Rhonda.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.186
Uh, thanks.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.156
Bye.

07:42.830 --> 07:46.233
All right, next up
is Linda from Teaneck.

07:46.233 --> 07:47.901
**

07:53.541 --> 07:56.143
Oh, my heartfelt
congratulations.

07:56.143 --> 07:59.713
- Twenty-five years
with this beauty.
- Huh?

07:59.713 --> 08:00.881
Such nachas.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.349
- Aww.
- Thank you, Herb.

08:02.349 --> 08:03.717
You're the best.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.418
And Fay, my condolences.

08:05.418 --> 08:08.188
Aww.

08:10.423 --> 08:11.859
- Sweetie?
- Hmm?

08:11.859 --> 08:14.127
Think maybe you should
slow down a little bit?

08:14.127 --> 08:15.563
I'm having fun.

08:15.563 --> 08:17.397
- Okay.
- Hmm?

08:18.566 --> 08:21.101
Herb, what do you hear?

08:21.101 --> 08:24.337
Do I have anything to worry
about with this upcoming
election?

08:24.337 --> 08:26.206
It's hard to say.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.741
But if I were you,

08:27.741 --> 08:29.577
I would clear up
this trial business.

08:29.577 --> 08:32.312
- The sooner, the better.
- Yeah.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.615
I'm trying.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.684
What kind of rubbers
do you like?

08:36.684 --> 08:38.185
My birthday isn't until April.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.753
Ha-ha, very funny.
Come on, be serious.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.822
I don't know. Anything.
Trojans. Why?

08:41.822 --> 08:45.192
'Cause I'm meeting Misty
when I get off work tonight.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.927
Tonight's the night?

08:46.927 --> 08:49.597
Yep. I've been watching
a ton of porn to prepare,

08:49.597 --> 08:51.098
boning up on positions
and stuff.

08:51.098 --> 08:53.433
- Sorry, bad choice of verbs.
- Another, please.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.468
You know what I mean.
Anyways, it's kind of
intimidating, porn.

08:55.468 --> 08:57.938
All these dudes are super-fit
and have giant dicks.

08:57.938 --> 09:00.741
Mine's average at best,
like a B, B-plus.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.743
Just chill.
Don't overthink it.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.845
That's not easy, given that
I've been thinking about
being with Misty

09:04.845 --> 09:08.181
pretty much non-stop since
sophomore year in high school.

09:09.617 --> 09:10.984
- Hey.
- Hey. You made it.

09:12.419 --> 09:13.754
Barely.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.923
My cab broke down
on the GW Bridge.

09:15.923 --> 09:17.625
Did you say hi
to your folks yet?

09:17.625 --> 09:19.359
I am gonna need a drink first.

09:19.359 --> 09:21.629
French martini?

09:21.629 --> 09:23.330
French people
don't drink martinis.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.132
They will mine.
I invented it.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.900
- Let me make you one.
- All right.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.936
Hey, I'm sorry
about the other night.

09:28.936 --> 09:31.304
- I was in a weird mood.
- It's okay.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.240
Did you end up staying late?

09:33.240 --> 09:36.043
Not there. Bunch of us
went back to my place,

09:36.043 --> 09:38.846
including that friend of Zan's
that teaches life drawing

09:38.846 --> 09:39.980
at the New School.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.082
She offered to critique
my work.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.517
- What did she think?
- She was pretty harsh.

09:44.517 --> 09:46.787
Brutal, actually.

09:46.787 --> 09:50.090
- I'm sorry.
- Whatever. What about you?

09:50.090 --> 09:51.524
- What did you do?
- Oh, nothing.

09:51.524 --> 09:54.294
You know, got some food,
went to bed.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.201
Nice, right?

10:02.535 --> 10:04.437
- Not bad.
- Not bad?

10:04.437 --> 10:06.606
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.975
Well, here I go.

10:13.246 --> 10:16.684
- Sweetheart.
- Happy anniversary.

10:16.684 --> 10:17.918
- Hey.
- Hi.

10:21.421 --> 10:24.224
Thank you for coming.
It means a lot.

10:26.694 --> 10:28.361
Where's Mom?

10:28.361 --> 10:32.232
She over with
the Sanders.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.401
Is that a new dress?

10:34.401 --> 10:37.971
Well, I got in Paris, so...

10:37.971 --> 10:40.373
- It's gorgeous.
- Thanks.

10:42.509 --> 10:45.178
- How's work?
- Good.

10:45.178 --> 10:46.446
And the trial?

10:46.446 --> 10:49.416
We had a good week.

10:49.416 --> 10:51.284
The lawyers are optimistic.

10:51.284 --> 10:52.720
That's good.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.087
Yeah.

11:04.732 --> 11:06.800
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:06.800 --> 11:10.570
So... how was work?

11:10.570 --> 11:13.073
No one drowned. You?

11:13.073 --> 11:16.409
Pretty good.
Made some decent tips.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.347
Okay, I know I said
I'd cook you dinner,

11:20.347 --> 11:22.449
but the truth
of the matter is...

11:22.449 --> 11:25.085
- I'm kind of a disaster
in the kitchen.
- That's great!

11:25.085 --> 11:27.587
'Cause I was thinking we
could actually go out instead.

11:27.587 --> 11:29.857
Oh, yeah. Okay. Um--

11:29.857 --> 11:31.959
Stupid door has a mind
of its own.

11:37.230 --> 11:40.100
Wouldn't you rather go back
to my ma's place and order in?

11:40.100 --> 11:43.270
I'd really like to take you out
somewhere nice, you know,

11:43.270 --> 11:45.939
something romantic
with waitresses and shit.

11:47.474 --> 11:48.475
Okay.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.377
Yeah? Cool.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.789
Mr. and Mrs. Getty,

12:01.789 --> 12:03.290
please allow me
to congratulate you

12:03.290 --> 12:04.892
on this most momentous
occasion.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.326
- Okay.
- Thank you.

12:08.195 --> 12:11.064
Mmm. Ahh.

12:17.337 --> 12:20.540
How's your little girlfriend,
the merry widow?

12:20.540 --> 12:22.309
Oh, so you've heard?

12:22.309 --> 12:24.211
Yes, we endeavored
to keep it discreet,

12:24.211 --> 12:26.546
but I suppose it was inevitable
that people would hear

12:26.546 --> 12:28.081
about our affair.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.817
I don't know what
I ever did to her,

12:29.817 --> 12:33.153
but she is busting my balls
on this election recall thing.

12:34.654 --> 12:37.891
To tap that prick Feinberg
to run against me?

12:37.891 --> 12:39.893
That was a low fucking blow.

12:41.461 --> 12:44.965
She's a spirited woman.
Passionate. Resolute.

12:44.965 --> 12:49.336
See, I think you get
a little confused sometimes

12:49.336 --> 12:52.505
as to who your real
friends are.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.374
Sir?

12:54.374 --> 12:57.845
If memory serves,
I was the one who
recruited you here.

12:57.845 --> 12:59.746
I hired you away
from Wendy Bush.

12:59.746 --> 13:02.549
I gave you your first
fuckin' job as a head pro.

13:02.549 --> 13:03.851
That was me.

13:03.851 --> 13:05.285
And I will forever
be grateful for that.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.420
No, what you should
be grateful for is,

13:07.420 --> 13:08.956
I didn't tell the feds

13:08.956 --> 13:12.492
that you bought Galexis
stock off of my tip,

13:12.492 --> 13:14.461
and I could have.

13:14.461 --> 13:15.896
Still can.

13:22.202 --> 13:23.236
Yeah.

13:27.540 --> 13:28.876
Hey.

13:28.876 --> 13:31.578
- What was that about?
- Ah, nothing.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.213
He's a big idiot.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.348
I should fire him and make
your boyfriend the head pro.

13:35.348 --> 13:38.685
Although, you know what,
David's developing quite
an interest in finance.

13:38.685 --> 13:42.055
Since when?

13:42.055 --> 13:45.258
We've talked about it
several times over lunch.

13:48.896 --> 13:52.499
Oof. Wow.
I liked you before,

13:52.499 --> 13:55.235
but now that I've seen
what you can do to
all-you-can-eat shrimp--

13:55.235 --> 13:57.604
Felt like a dare.
You grossed out?

13:57.604 --> 13:59.072
Totally the opposite.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.408
Like, if here wasn't
a 72-hour waiting period,

14:01.408 --> 14:03.410
I'd marry you tonight.

14:03.410 --> 14:08.115
So, uh, feel like picking up
some ice cream and eating it
back at my place?

14:08.115 --> 14:10.817
Sure. Yeah, yeah.

14:10.817 --> 14:14.221
- Or we could go catch a movie.
- A movie?

14:14.221 --> 14:17.090
Have you seen Aliens?
I hear its awesome.

14:24.231 --> 14:27.534
My darling.
Oh, you're a sight
for sore eyes.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.837
- You look ravishing as always.
- Oh, you're sweet.

14:30.837 --> 14:32.639
I'm glad I caught you.

14:32.639 --> 14:35.842
- I was hoping
that we could talk.
- Me, too.

14:35.842 --> 14:37.444
I've got a bit
of a surprise for you.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.479
Now, I know you said you wanted
to take it easy this weekend,

14:39.479 --> 14:42.115
but I cannot allow such
an important milestone

14:42.115 --> 14:43.951
to pass without celebrating.

14:43.951 --> 14:46.619
Milestone?

14:46.619 --> 14:48.721
It was exactly one month ago

14:48.721 --> 14:50.523
that we had our first date.

14:50.523 --> 14:53.526
One month since you rescued me
from a life of solitude

14:53.526 --> 14:55.028
and meaningless sex,

14:55.028 --> 14:57.965
and showed me that passion
is not merely reserved

14:57.965 --> 14:59.199
for the tenants
of Knott's Landing.

14:59.199 --> 15:01.134
- Oh.
- So to the mark the occasion,

15:01.134 --> 15:02.335
I've booked a room

15:02.335 --> 15:04.037
in a romantic little B&B
I know upstate,

15:04.037 --> 15:05.973
where we will enjoy
a three-star meal,

15:05.973 --> 15:07.574
Champagne breakfast,

15:07.574 --> 15:10.877
and a hot air balloon ride.

15:10.877 --> 15:14.747
Oh, Nasser, you are such
a dear, sweet man.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.116
Well--

15:16.116 --> 15:17.884
That's what makes this
so difficult.

15:17.884 --> 15:19.252
Oh, no, they're
actually quite safe.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.421
They almost never crash
or burst into flames.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.489
I did my research.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.591
I've met someone.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.893
Excuse me?

15:26.893 --> 15:28.395
Actually, that's not true.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.163
We've known each other
for many years.

15:30.163 --> 15:33.500
He is an old and dear
family friend,

15:33.500 --> 15:37.137
and we only recently realized
that our feelings for each other

15:37.137 --> 15:40.173
go deeper
than just friendship.

15:41.808 --> 15:44.477
I'm sorry.
Who is this?

15:44.477 --> 15:47.614
Rabbi Ken.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.716
The mohel?

15:49.716 --> 15:51.151
I'm so sorry.

15:57.857 --> 16:00.027
**

16:05.565 --> 16:07.100
Here you are.

16:12.139 --> 16:14.441
Your parents happy you came?

16:14.441 --> 16:15.642
Ecstatic.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.844
Of course, they want me
to stay the weekend.

16:17.844 --> 16:19.512
Awesome.

16:21.214 --> 16:24.751
- Except I can't.
- Oh.

16:24.751 --> 16:28.421
Why didn't you tell me
you've been having lunches
with my father?

16:31.058 --> 16:32.925
I didn't think
it was worth mentioning.

16:32.925 --> 16:35.695
"Not worth mentioning."

16:35.695 --> 16:37.430
It's no big deal. Honest.

16:37.430 --> 16:40.500
You said yourself
you wanted us to get
to know each other better.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.469
That's how he knew
where I work.

16:42.469 --> 16:43.836
You told him.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.938
No, I may have.
I don't remember--

16:45.938 --> 16:49.076
No, Zan said he came in
the other day looking for me.

16:49.076 --> 16:53.646
And when I wasn't there,
he tipped her $20 not
to mention he dropped by.

16:53.646 --> 16:56.183
Well, he's your father.
He has a right to know
where you work.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.784
Why are you defending him?

16:57.784 --> 16:59.519
- I'm--
- What?

16:59.519 --> 17:02.089
- Let go of me!
- Sweetheart, you're drunk!

17:02.089 --> 17:04.791
- I'm having fun!
- Lower your voice!
Lower your voice!

17:04.791 --> 17:05.892
Give me that.
Give me that.

17:05.892 --> 17:08.295
Aah!

17:08.295 --> 17:12.532
Oh, Christ.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.134
Fay, are you okay?

17:14.134 --> 17:16.669
- I need a refill.
- Get out of there.

17:16.669 --> 17:19.472
- The water's really nice.
- Do not make a scene!

17:19.472 --> 17:22.309
This is a scene? Getting cuffed
by the feds, that's a scene!

17:22.309 --> 17:24.344
This is a fucking party!

17:24.344 --> 17:26.279
- Do something, please.
- Like what?

17:26.279 --> 17:28.248
Hey, pull your car around
back to staff parking.

17:28.248 --> 17:29.782
I'll meet you there
in five minutes.

17:29.782 --> 17:30.750
Okay, okay.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.990
- Come here, Mrs. Getty.
- I'm liking you more and more.

17:37.990 --> 17:39.626
He is a good boy.

17:43.763 --> 17:46.933
- I'm never gonna sleep again.
- I know.

17:46.933 --> 17:50.002
So good. Though I totally knew
that Weyland Corporation dude

17:50.002 --> 17:53.640
was evil when he showed up
in that tan camping vest.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.376
All right, next time,
I get to pick the movie.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.711
Deal.

17:58.711 --> 18:02.482
Hey, so I should probably
drop you off home, right?

18:02.482 --> 18:05.918
Drop me off? What do you mean?
Don't you want to hang out?

18:05.918 --> 18:08.755
Oh, uh...

18:08.755 --> 18:12.058
yeah, I don't know, 'cause
it's getting kind of late.

18:12.058 --> 18:14.194
Okay. Wheeler, what's going on?

18:14.194 --> 18:16.363
Huh? Nothing.

18:16.363 --> 18:18.165
No, you've been acting weird
all night.

18:18.165 --> 18:21.768
It's like you're afraid
to be alone with me
or something.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.770
What? No.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.505
Really?

18:25.505 --> 18:28.575
I thought the plan was
for us to go to my ma's house,

18:28.575 --> 18:30.310
have a romantic night,
you know?

18:30.310 --> 18:32.245
Just the two of us.

18:32.245 --> 18:35.448
I just felt more like seeing
a movie and...

18:37.384 --> 18:39.852
Fuck.

18:43.423 --> 18:47.294
What's wrong?
You can tell me.

18:47.294 --> 18:50.630
Just this thing I've wished for
so long is finally happening,

18:50.630 --> 18:52.865
and I don't wanna screw it up.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.467
How would you screw it up?

18:54.467 --> 18:57.504
Disappointing you.

18:57.504 --> 18:59.639
Sexually.

19:01.574 --> 19:02.909
You won't.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.812
Now take me home.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.455
Thanks for the dry clothes.

19:15.455 --> 19:17.724
Hey, look at that.
Almost fits.

19:17.724 --> 19:20.126
- Here, get that in you.
- Oh, no, thanks.

19:20.126 --> 19:22.229
So you don't get pneumonia.

19:26.233 --> 19:28.235
- Is Mrs. Getty okay?
- Yeah.

19:28.235 --> 19:29.902
Skye's putting her to bed.

19:29.902 --> 19:32.239
She's gonna have a heck
of a hangover in the morning.

19:32.239 --> 19:35.642
Listen, I really appreciate
what you did for us tonight.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.644
Oh, yeah, sure.

19:39.111 --> 19:40.947
Those look really good on you.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.115
- You think?
- Yeah.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.451
I got a couple of suits
I don't wear.

19:44.451 --> 19:45.885
You can have them if you want.

19:45.885 --> 19:48.087
Armani. I got a pinstripe,
double-breasted.

19:48.087 --> 19:50.857
Oh, thanks. I mean, I don't
really wear suits a lot.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.292
Yeah, but you might.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.427
You know,
you can't play tennis forever,

19:54.427 --> 19:56.696
unless you want to end up
like Nash.

19:56.696 --> 20:00.267
And I've been thinking,
actually, uh...

20:00.267 --> 20:01.968
if you're interested,

20:01.968 --> 20:03.503
'cause I think you're ready,

20:03.503 --> 20:05.071
I could set you up with
an entry-level position

20:05.071 --> 20:06.539
on my trading desk
this fall.

20:06.539 --> 20:09.842
- Wow.
- Yeah, you think about it.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.511
Think about what?

20:11.511 --> 20:14.481
Coming to work for me
at Getty Capital.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.290
Good luck.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.725
Excuse me.

20:36.436 --> 20:40.139
Crap. Brad's here.

20:40.139 --> 20:42.208
But I thought you said
we had the place to ourselves.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.911
No, I know.
I guess they came home early.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.979
Fuck.

20:50.317 --> 20:51.851
What do we do now?

21:03.996 --> 21:07.500
I didn't give up living
in Paris just to come back

21:07.500 --> 21:09.436
to Jersey
and date a stock broker.

21:09.436 --> 21:11.237
I didn't say I was taking
the job.

21:11.237 --> 21:13.072
Well, you didn't say
you wouldn't.

21:13.072 --> 21:14.507
Well, he just asked.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.142
How much time do you need
to think about it?

21:16.142 --> 21:18.911
It would have been disrespectful
to turn him down too fast.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.847
But you are going
to turn him down, right?

21:20.847 --> 21:23.082
- Probably.
- Probably?

21:23.082 --> 21:25.618
Look, I'd be an idiot
to not at least consider it.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.354
There must be a thousand
other guys out there

21:27.354 --> 21:29.489
who would kill
for a job on Wall Street.

21:29.489 --> 21:32.359
But you're not like
a thousand other guys.

21:34.260 --> 21:36.062
And I thought you were
an artist.

21:36.062 --> 21:37.797
You know, I wish you'd
stop calling me that.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.098
Why?

21:39.098 --> 21:42.569
- It's what Zan calls herself.
- Exactly.

21:42.569 --> 21:43.970
What's that supposed to mean?

21:43.970 --> 21:45.805
Well, She's pretentious
as shit.

21:45.805 --> 21:49.275
Well, she says that you're
bridge and tunnel, so...

21:49.275 --> 21:51.043
Why are we talking about Zan?

21:51.043 --> 21:52.745
I just don't understand
why you're giving up

21:52.745 --> 21:54.013
on something that
you said you wanted.

21:54.013 --> 21:55.415
No, I'm not giving up.

21:55.415 --> 21:57.384
I'm just being realistic.

21:57.384 --> 21:58.685
That's your answer
for everything.

21:58.685 --> 22:00.387
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

22:00.387 --> 22:04.256
And it's not even true.
It's just an excuse.

22:04.256 --> 22:07.026
- You're just scared.
- Of what?

22:07.026 --> 22:10.663
Of everything.
Of everything.
Of taking a risk,

22:10.663 --> 22:11.898
of becoming a filmmaker.

22:11.898 --> 22:14.401
Instead,
you're wasting your time

22:14.401 --> 22:17.737
coaching tennis
and filming brises.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.105
It's called making
a living, okay?

22:19.105 --> 22:20.673
I wouldn't expect you
to understand.

22:20.673 --> 22:23.410
Excuse me!
I worked a double last night!

22:23.410 --> 22:24.844
Oh, give me a break!

22:24.844 --> 22:27.514
We both know it's not tips
paying your rent

22:27.514 --> 22:29.582
or your nice clothes
or your taxis to the city.

22:29.582 --> 22:31.884
It's your daddy's credit card.

23:08.955 --> 23:11.458
** "Emotion In Motion"
by Ric Ocasek]

23:20.332 --> 23:22.034
Good morning.

23:37.484 --> 23:39.786
* I would do anything *

23:41.488 --> 23:43.523
* To hold on to you *

* Till the stars
no longer wink *

24:04.210 --> 24:06.078
* I'll hold on to you *

24:09.516 --> 24:11.884
* Till you figure out *

24:11.884 --> 24:15.021
* Just what to think 'cause *

24:15.021 --> 24:18.024
* You're emotion in motion *

24:20.527 --> 24:22.595
* My magical potion *

24:24.363 --> 24:27.534
* You're emotion in motion *

24:27.534 --> 24:28.968
* To me *

24:36.543 --> 24:38.711
* I would go anywhere *

24:40.547 --> 24:42.549
* To meet up with you *

24:44.551 --> 24:49.556
* That's just about anywhere *

24:49.556 --> 24:51.558
* For one rendezvous *

24:53.960 --> 24:56.596
* I'd hold on to you *
