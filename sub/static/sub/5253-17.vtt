Really did a number on him.

15:57.287 --> 15:59.353
I mean, it doesn't have to
be like that, am I right?

15:59.355 --> 16:00.655
I mean, look at you.

16:00.657 --> 16:01.856
You're one of Matty's exes,

16:01.858 --> 16:03.491
and you guys are still chill.

16:03.493 --> 16:04.992
We are.

16:04.994 --> 16:06.761
<i>So Matty hadn't trashed me to Sully.</i>

16:06.763 --> 16:08.462
<i>He had protected me,</i>

protected him with my mom.</i>

16:11.000 --> 16:12.967
<i>We still had each other's backs.</i>

16:12.969 --> 16:15.569
He needed some serious cheering up.

16:15.571 --> 16:17.138
Took a while to get him out of that

16:17.140 --> 16:18.639
depressed head space he was in,

16:18.641 --> 16:23.277
but once he did, it's
been a party ever since.

16:23.279 --> 16:25.112
He's a really great guy.

16:25.114 --> 16:26.881
You're pretty great too, Sully.

Oh, whoa!

16:34.624 --> 16:36.991
Whoops, totally misread the vibe.

16:36.993 --> 16:39.660
My bad.

16:39.662 --> 16:42.763
Whoo! Fourth of July!

16:48.749 --> 16:49.981
I can't remember.

16:49.983 --> 16:51.449
Is it my turn to drink?

16:51.451 --> 16:52.384
No, you're good.

16:52.386 --> 16:53.952
Sully can really put them away.

16:53.954 --> 16:54.953
How do you keep up with her?

16:54.955 --> 16:56.288
I don't.

16:56.290 --> 16:57.956
I have one drink for every three she does.

16:57.958 --> 16:59.958
Oh, man, I've been going one for one.

16:59.960 --> 17:03.395
[both laughing]

17:03.397 --> 17:05.096
Hey, you're a good guy, Matty.

17:05.098 --> 17:06.897
I can't even remember why I hated you.

17:06.900 --> 17:09.434
Oh, right, because Jenna
was in love with you

17:09.435 --> 17:12.203
when she was dating me.

17:12.204 --> 17:13.771
Oh!

17:13.773 --> 17:16.675
Hey, hey, it is cool, dude.

17:16.676 --> 17:19.678
You don't have to worry about
Jenna and me anymore, okay?

17:19.680 --> 17:21.246
That chapter's closed.

17:22.647 --> 17:24.915
Okay. Okay.

17:28.921 --> 17:32.624
I just can't believe how hot
you got after high school.

17:32.626 --> 17:36.227
I literally would've voted
you most likely to not get hot.

17:36.229 --> 17:37.562
- Hmm.
- No offense.

17:37.564 --> 17:39.998
Hey, one thing I took
away from high school

17:40.000 --> 17:41.399
was a thick skin.

17:41.401 --> 17:43.335
And the one thing I left behind:

17:43.337 --> 17:45.870
my obsession for Jenna Hamilton.

17:45.872 --> 17:47.105
I realize it blinded me

17:47.107 --> 17:49.074
to all the other hot girls at Palos Hills

17:49.076 --> 17:50.075
I should've stalked.

17:50.077 --> 17:51.376
Okay, that was cute.

17:51.378 --> 17:53.478
Uh, Tamara, are you using me for sex

17:53.480 --> 17:56.548
because I'm the only single guy here?

17:56.550 --> 17:58.850
Yeah, sorry.

17:58.852 --> 18:00.352
I knew it.

18:00.354 --> 18:02.420
Wait, you're okay with this?

18:02.422 --> 18:03.655
Hell yeah!

18:03.657 --> 18:05.056

18:05.058 --> 18:06.391
- Let's go.
- [giggles]

18:10.930 --> 18:12.998
I better get the golf cart back.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
Those golf mofos get up early.

18:15.002 --> 18:17.135
Oh.

18:17.137 --> 18:20.205
Oh, I didn't realize
it was getting so late.

18:21.407 --> 18:23.475
We might as well crash at the clubhouse.

18:23.477 --> 18:25.744
We have to be back at
work in a couple hours.

18:25.746 --> 18:27.145
Well, what about Luke?

18:27.147 --> 18:28.913
I can't just leave him on the tee.

18:36.757 --> 18:39.858
[groans] Okay.

18:39.860 --> 18:41.026
He got so drunk.

18:41.028 --> 18:42.194
It's so not like him.

18:42.296 --> 18:43.862
Work is just stressing him out

18:43.864 --> 18:44.996
more than he'll admit.

18:44.998 --> 18:46.431
It's okay; everybody needs

18:46.433 --> 18:48.833
to blow it out every once in a while.

18:48.835 --> 18:50.802
He's a good guy.

18:50.804 --> 18:52.937
And he cares a lot about you.

18:52.939 --> 18:54.139
Thanks.

18:54.141 --> 18:57.008
And Sully's really cool too.

18:57.010 --> 18:58.676
You two are a good match.

18:58.678 --> 19:01.279
So now you're okay with my party girl?

19:01.281 --> 19:03.681
Yes, and I'm sorry about all that

19:03.683 --> 19:08.253
and also about how everything
went down last year.

19:08.255 --> 19:10.955
I was just really caught
up in my own stuff.

19:10.957 --> 19:12.490
No, you were doing your thing.

19:12.492 --> 19:15.760
The whole transferring to
Wyckoff idea was stupid.

19:15.762 --> 19:16.895
Really?

19:16.897 --> 19:18.129
Yeah, I get why you thought

19:18.131 --> 19:19.898
it was such a bad idea.

19:19.900 --> 19:23.068
I'm glad I stayed at Berkeley.

19:23.070 --> 19:24.769
It's all good now.

19:24.771 --> 19:27.972
Actually, there's just one
little thing to clear the air.

19:27.974 --> 19:31.009
Um, Sully tried to make out with me.

19:31.011 --> 19:33.678
Yeah?

What the hell is going on here?

19:48.840 --> 19:50.673
My boss called me in early

19:50.675 --> 19:52.341
because he said some idiots

19:52.343 --> 19:54.043
were having a party out on the golf course

19:54.045 --> 19:56.012
and they trashed the 16th tee.

19:56.014 --> 19:57.013
And that was you?

19:57.015 --> 19:58.114
Just get out of here.

Uh, I'm just cleaning up.

20:07.325 --> 20:09.058
I've got it under control.

Hey, Jake. Great party.

20:15.033 --> 20:16.432
That's it. You're fired.

You're gonna put all your
friends on the payroll

20:19.704 --> 20:20.770
I don't think so.

20:20.772 --> 20:21.737
You need to pack up your stuff.
