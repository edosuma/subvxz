<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:36.119 --> 00:38.019
Hank, it's hot again!

00:38.054 --> 00:39.146
It's Indian summer.

00:39.189 --> 00:41.453
Okay, Joe Jack,
you're on spatulas.

00:41.491 --> 00:42.924
Enrique, accessories.

00:42.959 --> 00:45.427
If we get any more crowded,
we'll go zone.

00:45.462 --> 00:46.952
Can I just get my tank filled?

00:46.996 --> 00:48.293
You know, I could do this

00:48.331 --> 00:50.094
on the Internet
for half the price.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.725
I've been here
longer than him.

00:53.002 --> 00:55.664
"Service" means
"serve us."

00:55.705 --> 00:57.400
He's right.

01:00.243 --> 01:01.267
Great!

01:01.311 --> 01:03.279
You're taking a break!

01:06.149 --> 01:08.947
Well, this all looks normal.

01:08.985 --> 01:12.148
Normal? I spent all day at work
bent over like an "L."

01:12.188 --> 01:15.487
Good posture is one of a
salesman's most potent weapons.

01:15.525 --> 01:17.686
I'm sorry, Mr. Hill.
I understand it's painful,

01:17.727 --> 01:20.161
but soft tissue injury just
doesn't show up on film.

01:20.196 --> 01:21.424
Huh, so how do you fix it?

01:21.464 --> 01:23.227
Well, there's really
nothing <i>I</i> can do.

01:23.266 --> 01:24.631
What your back needs is rest.

01:24.667 --> 01:26.066
Just have your office
send over

01:26.102 --> 01:27.626
your workers'
compensation forms,

01:27.670 --> 01:28.898
and I'll sign off on them.

01:28.938 --> 01:30.064
Workers' comp?!

01:30.106 --> 01:32.404
Do I look like a hobo to you?

01:32.442 --> 01:34.933
No, sir!
I'm not going on welfare.

01:34.978 --> 01:36.468
It's Indian summer!

01:36.513 --> 01:38.276
Well, if you insist
on working,

01:38.314 --> 01:41.112
I'll write you a prescription
for pain medicine.

01:41.151 --> 01:42.618
Whoa, there,
Dr. Feelgood.

01:42.652 --> 01:45.678
I work at a propane
dealership, not Woodstock.

01:45.722 --> 01:47.747
Then I'm sorry,
but all Western medicine

01:47.791 --> 01:49.986
can really offer you
are drugs and nothing.

01:50.026 --> 01:52.358
But some people have had
good luck with yoga.

01:52.395 --> 01:54.727
I heart here's a studio
over in McMaynerbury.

01:54.764 --> 01:57.096
Yoga?
Isn't that a cult?

01:57.133 --> 01:59.293
The group that rented the space
before them was a cult.

01:59.302 --> 02:00.862
That's probably
what you're thinking of.

02:00.904 --> 02:02.838
So, those are my choices?

02:02.872 --> 02:05.966
Workers' comp, drugs, or yoga?

02:10.547 --> 02:13.516
I hate to ask you this,
but I'm going to need

02:13.550 --> 02:15.882
some help putting
my pants back on.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.589
I hope I'm not being fussy.

02:22.625 --> 02:24.183
Actually, I know I'm not.

02:24.227 --> 02:27.287
But you put my canned tomatoes
on top of my bread

02:27.330 --> 02:29.764
and my chicken
right next to my bleach.

02:29.799 --> 02:30.857
So?

02:30.900 --> 02:33.164
So, I think
my family deserves better

02:33.203 --> 02:36.263
than poisoned chicken sandwiches
on crushed bread.

02:37.674 --> 02:40.074
Manager on four, please.

02:40.109 --> 02:41.235
Forget the ID, Mandy.

02:41.277 --> 02:42.904
Just sell her the cigarettes.

02:42.946 --> 02:44.379
This lady's got some deal

02:44.414 --> 02:46.814
about the chicken
or the bag or something.

02:46.850 --> 02:49.876
Peggy?! Do you know
who this lady is?

02:49.919 --> 02:52.251
This is Peggy Platter,
the greatest bagger

02:52.288 --> 02:53.915
the Pink and White ever saw!

02:53.957 --> 02:57.620
I'm Peggy Hill now,
but I think I still remember

02:57.660 --> 02:59.924
which end the food goes into.

03:01.831 --> 03:03.765
Whoo, its been a long time

03:03.800 --> 03:06.234
since I was on this side
of the dairy case.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.998
Those were the
days, huh, Pete?

03:08.037 --> 03:09.902
Me cutting my teeth in produce,

03:09.939 --> 03:12.066
and you anchoring
check stand three.

03:12.108 --> 03:13.507
Regular dream team.

03:13.543 --> 03:15.738
I know you've got
fresher milk back there!

03:15.778 --> 03:16.938
Put it out!

03:16.980 --> 03:18.607
Ah, everything's changed.

03:18.648 --> 03:21.879
Ever since Mega-Lo-Mart
started selling groceries,

03:21.918 --> 03:23.818
all folks want is low prices,

03:23.853 --> 03:26.253
convenient parking
and huge selection.

03:26.289 --> 03:27.313
I can't compete.

03:27.357 --> 03:29.325
Yes, you can.

03:29.359 --> 03:31.850
With great,
old-fashioned service.

03:31.895 --> 03:33.988
The kind I used to deliver.

03:34.030 --> 03:36.123
Peggy, are you saying?

03:36.165 --> 03:38.326
No, I'm not saying.
I'm bagging!

03:38.368 --> 03:39.960
Pete, fire up
your label maker.

03:40.003 --> 03:41.493
I'm going to need a name tag.

03:46.142 --> 03:48.007
Relax.

03:48.044 --> 03:49.671
I'm going to move the energy

03:49.712 --> 03:51.771
from your thighs
to your buttocks now.

03:51.814 --> 03:53.145
Hey, is my back straight?

03:53.182 --> 03:54.672
Face the wall!

03:54.717 --> 03:55.843
Uh, hello.

03:55.885 --> 03:57.944
I was wondering
if yoga can help my back,

03:57.987 --> 03:59.386
because it hurts like all...

04:00.423 --> 04:01.515
Huh?!

04:01.557 --> 04:03.081
Let me tell you a story.

04:03.126 --> 04:06.562
Once I was like you...
skeptical, nearsighted, paunchy.

04:06.596 --> 04:08.393
Then I met a special friend.

04:08.431 --> 04:12.333
This glorious friend took me
to places I thought I'd never...

04:12.368 --> 04:14.928
Excuse me, but is this
one of those stories

04:14.971 --> 04:18.498
where this "special friend"
of yours turns out to be yoga?

04:18.541 --> 04:21.567
What time do you
evacuate your bowels?

04:21.611 --> 04:23.238
What? There's only
one right answer...

04:23.279 --> 04:25.406
between 4:00 and 6:00
in the morning.

04:25.448 --> 04:26.813
Well, this was

04:26.849 --> 04:28.783
a great way
to spend a lunch hour.

04:28.818 --> 04:32.083
Lunch is one of the worst things
you can do to yourself.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.650
Dad, I learned
how to do a wheelie.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.387
Watch!

04:41.864 --> 04:43.661
Pretty impressive, son.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.997
Extreme.

04:45.034 --> 04:46.501
How was it?

04:46.536 --> 04:47.867
Crap wheelie.

04:47.904 --> 04:49.963
Dad, you look like
that old man

04:50.006 --> 04:51.837
we hate getting stuck behind

04:51.874 --> 04:53.899
in the buffet line at Luly's.

04:53.943 --> 04:56.503
Uh... yeah, I just got
a little knot in my back.

04:56.546 --> 04:57.672
It's nothing.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.773
Have you tried walking it off?

04:59.816 --> 05:01.613
That's great advice, Bobby.

05:01.651 --> 05:05.519
I'll finish up here,
then walk it off a little later.

05:07.123 --> 05:08.818
I didn't want
to tell Bobby this,

05:08.858 --> 05:11.258
but I spent all morning
trying to walk it off.

05:11.294 --> 05:12.886
I guess
we're just getting old.

05:12.929 --> 05:15.693
I used to be able to pull
my thumb back this far

05:15.732 --> 05:16.790
without it hurting.

05:16.833 --> 05:18.494
Now, when I do it, it hurts.

05:21.137 --> 05:22.695
It was easier
back in high school.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.172
When you didn't feel so great,

05:24.207 --> 05:25.765
Coach Sauers
would just give you

05:25.808 --> 05:27.901
some of those "go" pills,
and you felt like

05:27.944 --> 05:29.741
you could take on
the Dallas Cowboys.

05:29.779 --> 05:32.304
Man, you talkin'
'bout them dang ol' "go" pills, man?

05:32.348 --> 05:34.248
Talkin' 'bout
them ol' horse crank, man.

05:34.283 --> 05:35.750
Yeah, Coach's special vitamins

05:35.785 --> 05:36.945
really did the trick.

05:36.986 --> 05:38.977
I broke my leg
going for a touchdown,

05:39.022 --> 05:40.990
and I didn't realize
it for two days!

05:41.024 --> 05:44.118
Took seven police officers
to get me into that ambulance.

05:44.160 --> 05:45.593
Well, I may not have
"go" pills,

05:45.628 --> 05:46.788
but I have something else

05:46.829 --> 05:48.524
that's going to get me
through this...

05:48.564 --> 05:49.997
my work ethic.

05:50.033 --> 05:52.058
Hear! Hear!

05:55.238 --> 05:58.207
Oh, fine, I'll use a coaster.

05:59.475 --> 06:01.238
<i>Okay, big day today, folks</i>.

06:01.277 --> 06:03.302
Joe Jack, get those tanks
polished.

06:03.346 --> 06:05.371
Donna, where are those
P.O.'s I asked for?

06:05.415 --> 06:06.382
I'm Melinda.

06:06.416 --> 06:07.747
Oh, sorry.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.149
The new shoes threw me.

06:09.185 --> 06:11.210
Maybe you should just go home.

06:11.254 --> 06:14.018
What are you talking about,
uh, Brown Shoes?

06:14.057 --> 06:15.820
I'm fine.

06:17.560 --> 06:21.860
Uh, I'm just gonna
move this over there.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.731
And now for the test.

06:34.210 --> 06:35.768
I'm ready, Chet.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.211
Open the line.

06:37.246 --> 06:38.713
Paper or plastic?

06:38.748 --> 06:39.646
Plastic.

06:39.682 --> 06:41.309
That was a rhetorical question.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.757
Hank, I had the
most amazing day.

06:52.795 --> 06:55.457
Maybe good bagging
doesn't save lives,

06:55.498 --> 06:57.557
but I'd like to see
a heart surgeon

06:57.600 --> 07:00.569
pack a watermelon and light
bulbs in the same bag.

07:00.603 --> 07:03.299
Yeah, uh, could you open
this freezer for me?

07:03.339 --> 07:04.363
I got it started.

07:04.407 --> 07:06.170
Hank, this is ridiculous.

07:06.209 --> 07:07.801
You're gonna file
for Workers' Comp

07:07.844 --> 07:10.142
and lie around this house
until you are healthy.

07:10.179 --> 07:12.841
No! What kind of message
am I sending Bobby

07:12.882 --> 07:14.850
if I get paid for laying around

07:14.884 --> 07:16.112
doing nothing?

07:25.695 --> 07:27.253
Hmm, maybe you're right.

07:29.565 --> 07:31.260
How's your back, honey?

07:31.300 --> 07:32.267
Great, Joe Jack.

07:32.301 --> 07:34.269
How's your gambling problem?

07:36.973 --> 07:37.940
I'm sorry, Joe Jack.

07:37.974 --> 07:39.271
I'm just a little under...

07:39.308 --> 07:41.299
Hank, I can't have
my salespeople

07:41.344 --> 07:43.778
all hunched over
talking to themselves.

07:43.813 --> 07:45.144
It ain't good for business.

07:45.181 --> 07:47.513
You give any thought
to going on Workers' Comp?

07:47.550 --> 07:49.177
Rest easy,
Mr. Strickland.

07:49.218 --> 07:50.776
That's not gonna happen.

07:50.820 --> 07:52.947
Whoa! Slow down, Old Top.

07:52.989 --> 07:56.618
If you go on Worker's Comp,
I can have Joe Jack's cousin

07:56.659 --> 07:58.684
fill in for you
for half the pay

07:58.728 --> 08:02.357
and still have half to buy
my new lady some studio time.

08:02.398 --> 08:04.866
Mr. Strickland,
as long as I'm breathing,

08:04.901 --> 08:06.163
I'm gonna do my job.

08:06.202 --> 08:07.794
Now, if you'll excuse me, sir,

08:07.837 --> 08:10.237
I have some new tongs
that need displaying.

08:19.282 --> 08:21.580
I'm okay. I'm okay.

08:25.621 --> 08:29.785
Enrique, could you hand me one
of those Workers' Comp forms?

08:29.825 --> 08:31.122
And a pen.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.126
Wait, never mind.

08:32.160 --> 08:33.991
There's a bunch under this desk.

08:44.006 --> 08:45.246
<i>So what are we looking at here?</i>

08:45.274 --> 08:47.174
Slip and fall, carpal tunnel?

08:47.210 --> 08:48.507
Oh, here it is.

08:48.544 --> 08:51.069
"Lifted
two propane tanks at once."

08:51.113 --> 08:54.139
Yeah, I almost
wrote "temporary insanity."

08:54.183 --> 08:56.276
Boy, a lot

08:56.319 --> 08:57.411
of paperwork, huh?

08:57.453 --> 08:58.715
Mmm. It's half my job.

08:58.754 --> 09:01.279
The other half
is exposing fakers.

09:01.324 --> 09:02.882
Why would anybody fake it?

09:02.925 --> 09:05.155
I love the look
on a customer's face

09:05.194 --> 09:07.321
when I top off
their propane tank.

09:07.363 --> 09:08.762
The government can't send me

09:08.798 --> 09:10.789
that kind
of satisfaction in the mail.

09:10.833 --> 09:13.358
Mr. Hill, you can
take it down a notch.

09:13.402 --> 09:15.597
Okay. You need
to see a doctor.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.196
I already saw a doctor.

09:17.240 --> 09:19.868
Just for fun, see our doctor.

09:19.909 --> 09:21.467
There's nothing here,

09:21.510 --> 09:24.536
but you say that you
can't straighten up?

09:24.580 --> 09:26.878
Well, maybe the first thing
we should look at...

09:26.916 --> 09:29.180
What did you do that for?

09:29.218 --> 09:30.685
It slipped.

09:30.720 --> 09:33.689
As I was saying,
back injuries vary.

09:33.723 --> 09:35.850
I've found the best
course of treatment...

09:35.891 --> 09:37.916
What the got-danged?

09:37.960 --> 09:40.019
Oh, well played, Mr. Hill.

09:40.062 --> 09:42.792
It's my medical opinion
that you might not be faking.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.356
Go home. Wait for your check.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.867
Well, aren't you gonna help me?

09:45.901 --> 09:46.890
I don't want a check.

09:46.936 --> 09:48.460
I just want to get back to work.

09:48.504 --> 09:51.098
I already said
well played, Mr. Hill.

09:54.410 --> 09:55.741
Back trouble?

09:55.778 --> 09:57.643
You look like you
could use a second opinion.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.477
Torn cartilage...

09:59.515 --> 10:01.642
hernia, stress trauma...

10:01.684 --> 10:03.879
Oh, we're going to need
a lot more X rays.

10:03.919 --> 10:07.719
More? I've had 40 got-danged
X rays in two days.

10:07.757 --> 10:10.021
Well, nobody said making money
was easy, Mr. Hill.

10:10.059 --> 10:11.856
Think of getting X rays
as your new job.

10:11.894 --> 10:14.192
Oh, and for your
emotional distress,

10:14.230 --> 10:16.070
here's the number
of a very sympathetic lawyer.

10:16.832 --> 10:18.197
<i>"Accidente?!"</i>

10:18.234 --> 10:20.202
Hey, this guy's on TV.

10:20.236 --> 10:21.794
This consultation

10:21.837 --> 10:22.861
is over.

10:27.243 --> 10:29.234
And you have
a great day, you hear?

10:30.446 --> 10:31.845
You know, bagging groceries

10:31.881 --> 10:34.475
has given me a strange
window into people's lives.

10:34.517 --> 10:36.417
I put their secrets
in a paper sack.

10:36.452 --> 10:38.215
I tell them to have a great day,

10:38.254 --> 10:40.085
but I'm not sure they do.

10:40.122 --> 10:44.081
I'm up to three beers
on my lunch break.

10:45.127 --> 10:47.220
Mmm. Yup.

10:47.263 --> 10:48.423
Yep.

10:48.464 --> 10:50.227
Mm-hmm.

10:50.266 --> 10:51.824
Yup.

10:52.935 --> 10:54.459
All I want to do is go to work

10:54.503 --> 10:55.970
and everybody's acting like

10:56.005 --> 10:58.166
I'm trying to pull off
some kind of scam.

10:58.207 --> 11:00.334
Your shoe's untied, Bill.

11:00.376 --> 11:01.775
How embarrassing.

11:01.811 --> 11:04.177
I thought I'd removed the
laces from these shoes.

11:04.213 --> 11:05.612
Yeah, man,
you been knocked down

11:05.648 --> 11:07.377
in your prime, man,
just talkin' 'bout,

11:07.416 --> 11:09.179
like, like dang ol'
<i>Brian's Song,</i> man.

11:09.218 --> 11:10.879
That part when
they go dang ol' talkin' 'bout

11:10.920 --> 11:11.920
ol' "Hang in there, Pic."

11:11.921 --> 11:12.888
You'll see, Hank.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.549
Lying around the house alone

11:14.590 --> 11:15.852
all day isn't so bad.

11:15.891 --> 11:18.416
After a while,
your couch and your TV

11:18.461 --> 11:20.861
will become
your mother and father.

11:20.896 --> 11:22.727
The couch is your mother.

11:22.765 --> 11:25.199
Clearly, you are
not yet comfortable

11:25.234 --> 11:27.202
being a leech on the system.

11:27.236 --> 11:31.502
Slither into America's large
intestine and clamp on, Hank.

11:31.540 --> 11:33.337
Sorry, Dale,
but that's not for me.

11:33.376 --> 11:35.435
My first Workers' Comp
check came today

11:35.478 --> 11:37.207
and I don't even
want to open it.

11:37.246 --> 11:40.807
Well, if you're determined to
hold on to your blind prejudice

11:40.850 --> 11:44.547
against being a parasite, maybe
you should go see John Redcorn.

11:44.587 --> 11:46.714
Nancy used to get
his deep massages

11:46.756 --> 11:48.747
and come home limp as a noodle.

11:50.593 --> 11:53.221
Oh, Hank, you look
lonely down there.

11:53.262 --> 11:54.354
Bill.

11:54.397 --> 11:55.762
Sorry.

12:01.604 --> 12:02.832
Uh...

12:02.872 --> 12:03.896
Hank?

12:03.939 --> 12:05.167
Uh...

12:05.207 --> 12:07.698
Funny story, John Redcorn, uh...

12:07.743 --> 12:09.768
See, I'm in terrible pain.

12:11.414 --> 12:15.043
♪ Close the door... ♪

12:15.084 --> 12:16.517
Yeah... So, uh...

12:16.552 --> 12:18.611
This is my first massage.

12:18.654 --> 12:20.281
Put your face in the hole, Hank.

12:20.322 --> 12:22.620
Can you make
the lights any brighter?

12:22.658 --> 12:24.387
That's as bright as they go.

12:24.427 --> 12:27.055
Is this Luther Vandross?

12:27.096 --> 12:28.723
Teddy Pendergrass.

12:28.764 --> 12:30.891
Can you, uh, turn it off?

12:30.933 --> 12:33.060
No. It's wired to the lights.

12:34.570 --> 12:35.594
Guess I'll begin.

12:35.638 --> 12:37.435
Yeah.

12:43.245 --> 12:45.213
I was also thinking
about yoga.

12:45.247 --> 12:46.407
Yoga's great.

12:46.449 --> 12:47.973
Do it, man.
Forget the massage.

12:54.723 --> 12:57.851
Oh, look who's
come crawling back.

12:57.893 --> 13:00.828
Hank, why does your yoga mat
say "Welcome?"

13:00.863 --> 13:04.230
Because where I get my mats,
they don't sell yoga mats.

13:05.601 --> 13:08.502
And let's get started
with Pavanamuk tasana.

13:12.475 --> 13:15.171
That's a funny name,
pavanamuk?

13:15.211 --> 13:17.702
It means
the Wind-Relieving Pose.

13:17.746 --> 13:19.179
Why do they call it that?

13:24.620 --> 13:28.181
Breathe through your feet.

13:28.224 --> 13:30.522
Draw the air from the floor,

13:30.559 --> 13:32.390
through your ankles...

13:32.428 --> 13:33.861
Breathe through your feet?

13:33.896 --> 13:37.593
You know, most men
desire control.

13:37.633 --> 13:41.399
Yogis control desire.

13:41.437 --> 13:43.405
Excuse me, Victor.

13:43.439 --> 13:46.840
Uh, Victor? Vic?

13:46.876 --> 13:48.867
Yogi Victor.

13:48.911 --> 13:49.878
Yes?

13:49.912 --> 13:51.402
We've been doing these stretches

13:51.447 --> 13:52.414
for half an hour.

13:52.448 --> 13:53.608
When do we start the yoga?

13:58.721 --> 13:59.847
Hank, do you tell your blood

13:59.889 --> 14:01.083
to start moving through your
veins?

14:01.123 --> 14:03.421
Or the air
to start filling your lungs?

14:04.860 --> 14:06.384
You probably do.

14:06.428 --> 14:07.827
You know, Vince Lombardi

14:07.863 --> 14:12.061
won five championships
without ever using sarcasm.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.194
He just yelled
and shoved people.

14:14.236 --> 14:17.296
Until you learn how to do that,
I'm out of here.

14:17.339 --> 14:20.001
Hey... I'm bending.

14:20.042 --> 14:21.566
Son of a gun,

14:21.610 --> 14:22.577
it's working!

14:22.611 --> 14:23.669
It's not working.

14:23.712 --> 14:25.202
It is.

14:29.552 --> 14:31.315
This is the first time

14:31.353 --> 14:33.617
I've ever been disgusted
by the human body.

14:41.630 --> 14:43.825
As you breathe into this pose,

14:43.866 --> 14:46.528
remember: I have
a new relaxation tape

14:46.569 --> 14:48.366
of me making ocean noises.

14:48.404 --> 14:49.393
And Friday night,

14:49.438 --> 14:50.598
my band will be performing

14:50.639 --> 14:52.079
at the Pita Pocket
on Wimberley Road.

14:53.576 --> 14:55.942
The pain... it's gone.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.070
I'm better!

14:57.112 --> 14:58.443
I can finally quit
this nonsense.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.641
One can't leave yoga, Hank.

15:00.683 --> 15:01.911
Yoga...
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:01.951 --> 15:04.442
Everything is one way,
then it's the opposite.

15:04.486 --> 15:05.748
Gotta go.

15:31.580 --> 15:34.276
I saw a man and a woman
buying the same kind of soup

15:34.316 --> 15:35.613
and I introduced them.

15:35.651 --> 15:37.983
Maybe I can even find
someone for you, Pete.

15:39.455 --> 15:42.583
Heck, who'd want a 40-year-old
supermarket manager?

15:42.625 --> 15:43.751
Mmm, good point.

15:43.792 --> 15:45.157
Peggy,

15:45.194 --> 15:46.559
my back's all better!

15:46.595 --> 15:49.860
Yep, that yoga mumbo-jumbo
almost drove me crazy.

15:49.898 --> 15:51.763
But you can't argue
with this...

15:57.573 --> 15:58.699
Where are you going?

15:58.741 --> 15:59.730
To work!

15:59.775 --> 16:00.742
Aw, dang it,

16:00.776 --> 16:02.300
it's already 5:00.

16:02.344 --> 16:04.403
I wonder if I'll be able
to sleep tonight!

16:04.446 --> 16:06.141
God, I feel great!

16:10.152 --> 16:11.847
Say "fraud!"

16:22.765 --> 16:24.392
I'm gonna leave
a little early,

16:24.433 --> 16:27.300
pick up a "It's Good to be
Back" cake for the gang.

16:28.971 --> 16:30.632
Feeling better, Mr. Hill?

16:30.673 --> 16:32.834
I knew you
were a fraud from the get-go.

16:32.875 --> 16:34.069
Fraud?! What?

16:34.109 --> 16:36.441
No, I've only been better
a few hours.

16:36.478 --> 16:38.036
Sure. Let me guess...

16:38.080 --> 16:39.707
you were just
on your way to work.

16:39.748 --> 16:41.477
I was!
Look at my shirt!

16:41.517 --> 16:43.109
Oh, please.

16:43.152 --> 16:45.211
My teenage daughter
has a work shirt that says "Hank".

16:45.254 --> 16:49.418
Mr. Hill, the law takes a very
dim view of workers' comp fraud.

16:49.458 --> 16:53.292
Oh, God... Are we talking
about the bunco squad?

16:53.328 --> 16:55.057
I'll see you
at the fraud inquiry.

16:55.097 --> 16:56.530
Feel free to wear the shirt.

16:56.565 --> 16:58.795
I'd love to help you, Hank,
but you're on your own.

16:58.834 --> 17:00.358
Mr. Strickland!

17:00.402 --> 17:01.960
I know you're telling
the truth,

17:02.004 --> 17:03.403
but when I get on the stand,

17:03.439 --> 17:06.704
I got a nasty habit
of incriminating myself.

17:06.742 --> 17:08.471
We can't have both of us
in the pokey.

17:08.510 --> 17:10.478
What about Team Strickland?

17:10.512 --> 17:13.845
Yeah, I never understood
what you meant by that, Hank.

17:13.882 --> 17:16.406
Now, I need to get Jasmine
to the studio.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.214
I got a record to produce.

17:18.252 --> 17:20.380
Putout that cigarette.

17:20.422 --> 17:22.515
You're gonna hurt your pipes.

17:23.892 --> 17:26.952
I was going crazy when
I was out of work for a week.

17:26.994 --> 17:29.259
Now I could be out
of propane forever.

17:29.298 --> 17:32.199
Who's going to hire
a guy convicted of fraud?

17:32.234 --> 17:33.861
Oh, I'll hire you, Hank.

17:33.902 --> 17:35.631
I can always use a convict

17:35.671 --> 17:37.468
to blame my shoddy work on.

17:38.907 --> 17:40.169
<i>Mr. Hill,</i>

17:40.209 --> 17:41.809
workers' comp fraud
is a very big problem

17:41.810 --> 17:43.243
in this state.

17:43.278 --> 17:45.712
You know how many mailmen
slipped on ice last year?

17:45.748 --> 17:47.272
412.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.375
You know how much ice
we got in Texas?

17:49.418 --> 17:50.783
None.

17:50.819 --> 17:53.720
Mr. Chairman, I know you see me
as a cheat and a fraud.

17:53.756 --> 17:56.452
But back when I played football
at Arlen High,

17:56.492 --> 18:00.189
I called a penalty on myself
for illegal motion.

18:00.229 --> 18:01.856
Wait, you played for Arlen?

18:01.897 --> 18:03.228
Yep, running back.

18:03.265 --> 18:05.790
Would've probably won State
if our special teams,

18:05.834 --> 18:07.597
and my ankle,
hadn't broken down.

18:07.636 --> 18:09.797
I played for Arlen, too.

18:09.838 --> 18:11.135
Class of '75.

18:11.173 --> 18:13.368
I was one
of the "Sack-tastic Four."

18:13.408 --> 18:15.239
Wait, you were the one
who yelled,

18:15.277 --> 18:16.574
"It's clobbering time."

18:16.612 --> 18:18.671
Mr. Hill, you seem
like a decent guy,

18:18.714 --> 18:20.648
and I'd really like
to believe you,

18:20.682 --> 18:22.274
but you don't have pictures.

18:22.317 --> 18:23.648
This lady has pictures.

18:23.685 --> 18:26.153
She took those
after I did my yoga.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.951
You did yoga?

18:27.990 --> 18:31.790
Are you sure you played
American football, not soccer?

18:31.827 --> 18:33.818
No, no. I hate soccer.

18:33.862 --> 18:36.490
I just went to that place
because...

18:36.532 --> 18:40.093
Uh, Mr. Chairman,
if it pleases the fraud hearing,

18:40.135 --> 18:43.002
I would like to call
a surprise witness.

18:43.038 --> 18:45.700
Wow, we've never had
one of those before.

18:51.947 --> 18:56.680
This room has an awful energy.

18:56.718 --> 18:59.687
Now, which one of you
doubts my powers?

18:59.721 --> 19:01.382
You? You?

19:01.423 --> 19:02.583
You?

19:02.624 --> 19:03.955
Calm down, fella.

19:03.992 --> 19:06.119
Your powers
aren't under investigation here.

19:06.161 --> 19:09.858
Now, could you please tell us
about Mr. Hill's rehabilitation?

19:09.898 --> 19:12.128
I can attest that
he came to class

19:12.167 --> 19:14.795
complaining of
debilitating back pain,

19:14.837 --> 19:17.305
attended three
classes, and he left.

19:17.339 --> 19:19.102
He bought no merchandise,

19:19.141 --> 19:21.473
and complained
about the incense.

19:24.413 --> 19:25.880
Okay, and for the record,

19:25.914 --> 19:28.974
could you explain the nature
of your yoga treatment.

19:29.017 --> 19:32.316
I could try,
but how could you put <i>this</i>

19:32.354 --> 19:33.719
into the record?

19:33.755 --> 19:35.655
Mmm...

19:35.691 --> 19:37.682
Mmm... ooh.

19:37.726 --> 19:40.160
Mr. Hill, this guy is
not helping your case.

19:40.195 --> 19:41.321
Exactly.

19:41.363 --> 19:43.331
Let me ask you,
what healthy person

19:43.365 --> 19:46.459
would voluntarily spend
five minutes with this joker?

19:46.501 --> 19:49.368
If I wasn't in horrible pain,

19:49.404 --> 19:51.838
wouldn't I have kicked
this guy's ass?

19:54.910 --> 19:56.343
We find for Hank Hill.

19:56.378 --> 19:57.675
Congratulations.

19:57.713 --> 19:59.010
Oh, thank God.

19:59.047 --> 20:00.776
Why are you rewarding this man

20:00.816 --> 20:02.511
for abandoning the yoga way?!

20:02.551 --> 20:04.018
Look at him!

20:04.052 --> 20:05.519
He's clenched
from his back muscles

20:05.554 --> 20:06.851
down to his inner eye.

20:06.889 --> 20:08.379
You can't deny you still hurt.

20:08.423 --> 20:10.084
Is that true, Mr. Hill?

20:10.125 --> 20:11.990
Are you still experiencing
any pain?

20:12.027 --> 20:13.858
Just an occasional twinge.

20:13.896 --> 20:15.193
I'm sorry, Mr. Hill,

20:15.230 --> 20:16.891
but we can't risk
you having a relapse.

20:16.932 --> 20:19.059
You're going to have to continue
your treatment.

20:20.135 --> 20:23.104
I demand you buy a tank top.

20:23.138 --> 20:24.969
I just had the most
brilliant idea.

20:25.007 --> 20:26.599
As a promotion,
I could compete

20:26.642 --> 20:28.610
against some sort
of bagging machine.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.373
A Russian bagging machine.

20:30.412 --> 20:32.903
Uh, I don't know if
that's gonna happen, Peggy.

20:32.948 --> 20:34.939
Pink & White's
going out of business.

20:34.983 --> 20:36.848
Turns out people
really do care

20:36.885 --> 20:39.376
more about low prices
than good bagging.

20:39.421 --> 20:40.718
I can't believe it.

20:40.756 --> 20:42.849
Chet and I got offers
from Mega Lo Mart.

20:42.891 --> 20:44.188
Why don't you come with?

20:44.226 --> 20:45.557
Mm-mm, not for me.

20:45.594 --> 20:47.186
Maybe, in another 20 years,

20:47.229 --> 20:49.493
people will appreciate
bagging again.

20:49.531 --> 20:50.896
Sure doesn't look like it.

20:50.933 --> 20:51.991
And when they do,

20:52.034 --> 20:54.093
Peggy Hill will be ready.

20:56.505 --> 20:58.939
That jackass at the Yoga center

20:58.974 --> 21:01.534
calls this one,
"Sun salutation,"

21:01.576 --> 21:04.374
but I prefer
"Modified Joe Theisman."

21:04.413 --> 21:06.210
Hey, Hank,
I feel, like, at one

21:06.248 --> 21:07.840
with everything right now.

21:07.883 --> 21:10.784
I just felt my
chakra open, honey.

21:10.819 --> 21:13.117
Now we're gonna move
into something I call,

21:13.155 --> 21:16.249
"Fertilizing the Lawn."

21:16.291 --> 21:22.751
