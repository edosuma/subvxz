00:25.400 --> 00:28.893
So, without further ado,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:29.029 --> 00:32.192
I present to you the governor
of this great state of ours,

00:32.323 --> 00:36.409
dare I say the future President
of these United States,

00:36.537 --> 00:40.076
please welcome Governor John Francis!

00:48.840 --> 00:51.708
Thank you. Thank you.

00:51.843 --> 00:55.507
Thank you all for coming out
on this very special night.

00:59.851 --> 01:03.470
Ladies and gentlemen,
fellow Washingtonians,

01:04.982 --> 01:09.943
we live in dangerous times,
times riddled with adversity.

01:10.862 --> 01:13.400
But it is only through challenges

01:13.532 --> 01:16.570
that great opportunities
present themselves

01:16.702 --> 01:18.864
to change our very future.

01:56.283 --> 01:59.151
Christ, I could use a stiff drink
and some SportsCenter.

01:59.286 --> 02:00.993
These speeches are starting
to get a little...

02:01.121 --> 02:03.864
- Rote, sir?
- Well, I was going to go with soul-sucking,

02:03.999 --> 02:06.366
but, yes, now that I'm running
for President,

02:06.501 --> 02:09.084
I guess rote does sound better.

02:25.145 --> 02:28.434
Come on, guys, is this really necessary?

02:31.610 --> 02:32.646
Down!

03:03.850 --> 03:05.136
Do I know you?

03:07.813 --> 03:10.556
If you pull that trigger, I guarantee you

03:10.691 --> 03:14.731
my guys will not stop,
not until you're found,

03:14.861 --> 03:16.568
captured, and killed.

03:57.404 --> 04:00.647
Police, move! Move, move, move!

04:48.121 --> 04:50.613
Police! Hands in the air!

04:53.001 --> 04:55.914
Hands where I can see them.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.839
Hands in the air!

05:00.967 --> 05:03.675
I need you to slow down. Where you at?

05:03.804 --> 05:05.887
Watch out, he's got a bomb!

05:06.014 --> 05:08.131
He's got a bomb! Down!

05:08.266 --> 05:11.054
- Everyone down!
- Move, move!

05:45.512 --> 05:47.174
Jesus, baby.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.801
- Are you okay?
- Uh-huh.

05:54.563 --> 05:58.728
I warned you, you can't mix
the grain with the grape.

06:04.197 --> 06:08.111
- Were we drinking last night?
- Yeah, with the Andersons.

06:08.243 --> 06:11.953
We had wine with dinner,
then you drank whiskey with Phil.

06:12.080 --> 06:15.244
- I have this worst headache, too.
- Oh, here.

06:22.424 --> 06:24.336
Here you go, tough guy.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.088
Thanks.

06:35.395 --> 06:40.060
Dr. Connelly, it's a pleasure to have you
here to talk about the brain,

06:40.191 --> 06:43.855
the body and the connections
that you have made between the two.

06:43.987 --> 06:48.402
Now, I have read about identical twins
being separated at birth that grew up...

06:48.533 --> 06:53.073
- I hope Jesse got the register fixed.
- Yet they have the same hobbies,

06:53.204 --> 06:56.447
they wear the same clothes,
they have the same hairstyle,

06:56.583 --> 07:01.374
even down to the same type of dog, but you
are suggesting something so much more.

07:01.504 --> 07:03.666
Well, something deeper in their DNA.

07:03.798 --> 07:06.757
My research has shown
in some cases these types of twins

07:06.885 --> 07:09.423
can share some of the same
emotions and memories

07:09.554 --> 07:12.922
due to synaptic, possibly
even telepathic, convergence.

07:13.058 --> 07:16.472
That's interesting.
What made you go down that path?

07:16.603 --> 07:20.813
- That aspirin actually helped.
- Good. You look better.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.441
There you go.

07:51.096 --> 07:53.713
Have you been before?
Like, would you wanna go, or...

07:53.848 --> 07:56.181
- Ah, I'll check on my schedule.
- Okay.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.892
Here, pancakes there.
Om, scrambled, there.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.977
- Thank you.
- Sarah, I was thinking...

08:01.106 --> 08:02.642
- No.
- Maybe when you...

08:02.774 --> 08:06.063
- No, Jesse. Just no.
- See what she does to me.

08:06.194 --> 08:08.902
- Jesse?
- It's 'cause you ask every time.

08:12.242 --> 08:16.031
The bitch thought I wasn't good enough.
Do I look not good enough to you?

08:16.162 --> 08:18.370
Jesse, honey, table six.

08:18.498 --> 08:22.583
Alright, I get it. Wait. Uh... okay, fine.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.508
- Good morning, Gabriel.
- Morning, Sheriff.

08:34.639 --> 08:38.383
- Brinn, how's it going, darling?
- Not bad.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.510
Oh, Gabe, Jesse said that
he can take me home tonight.

08:41.645 --> 08:43.511
I got my cooking class.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.814
You know, before we kilt 'em all,

08:54.159 --> 08:57.527
the Indians believed that when you died,

08:57.662 --> 08:59.699
you were reborn

08:59.831 --> 09:03.541
over and over and over.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.084
Called it reincarnation.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.499
I think you mean Buddhists.

09:08.631 --> 09:11.089
Well, either way,
it kind of makes you wonder

09:11.217 --> 09:14.255
why that was ever a need for law and order.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.846
I mean, if you're just gonna wake up again,

09:17.974 --> 09:22.389
then why not kill your friend
and fuck his wife?

09:23.104 --> 09:25.437
Well, you best be careful.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.433
Buddhists also believe in bad karma.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.185
You could come back as that fly.

09:32.155 --> 09:36.866
Well, I was fighting in Iraq.
We were fighting for the right reasons.

09:37.993 --> 09:41.462
To protect you... and your flies.

10:01.184 --> 10:03.096
- Hey.
- Hi.

10:03.228 --> 10:04.764
Those for me?

10:04.896 --> 10:09.891
Um, no, I was going to have
a date, but... they cancelled.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.985
I got a knife in my hand, do not tease me.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.400
I will keep that in mind.

10:15.532 --> 10:16.864
13!

10:17.575 --> 10:19.316
Lucky number.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.786
It's only the sixth.
My birthday's not for another week.

10:22.914 --> 10:24.906
Well, consider it an early gift,

10:25.041 --> 10:27.658
in case I forget like last year.

10:33.758 --> 10:37.627
If you like the stew tonight,
we can put it on the new menu.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.490
Gabriel, honey, you're having a seizure!

11:08.626 --> 11:11.994
Talk to me!
Baby, baby, talk to me, please!

11:12.130 --> 11:14.087
Oh, my God.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.575
Beer's nice and cold.

12:02.889 --> 12:05.347
- Jack?
- Yes, dear?

12:05.475 --> 12:08.092
Why'd you have to become a politician?

12:08.228 --> 12:10.390
You know why, dear.

12:10.521 --> 12:12.137
Make a difference.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.640
Then let's stop going
to those insufferable events

12:14.776 --> 12:17.143
and go to Africa
and make a real difference.

12:17.278 --> 12:20.988
I thought we were still
talking about beer.

12:22.200 --> 12:25.034
I don't know, Republic of Congo
is poverty stricken, isn't it?

12:25.161 --> 12:28.325
Maybe we should go to the Congo.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.911
- Mm...
- Beer?

12:38.967 --> 12:40.924
Mm. Tasty.

12:41.052 --> 12:44.511
You know, I can't tell
if you are smart, or naughty.

12:44.639 --> 12:47.507
You'll have to find out, won't you?

12:49.269 --> 12:52.353
- Bring me some peanuts.
- All right.

13:18.506 --> 13:20.213
Who sent you?

13:20.842 --> 13:22.049
Get back!

13:22.844 --> 13:26.463
- Oh, my God, Jack!
- Julia, back inside.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.229
Who the fuck sent you? Ah!

13:41.446 --> 13:43.904
SOL? Who was it?

13:44.907 --> 13:46.239
SFB?

13:47.785 --> 13:48.946
Argh!

13:59.172 --> 14:00.959
Ah!

14:06.721 --> 14:08.087
Let us go!

14:09.222 --> 14:10.339
Stop it!

14:10.475 --> 14:12.307
Stop or I'll shoot!

15:25.550 --> 15:28.418
You're scaring me. You can't do this
when you wake up from dreams.

15:28.553 --> 15:30.135
You gotta just try and forget about it.

15:30.263 --> 15:34.052
It's so... it's so vivid,
every fucking scene.

15:35.226 --> 15:38.390
Every heartbeat. I have no control.

15:38.521 --> 15:41.389
Something's fucking wrong with me!

15:41.524 --> 15:43.516
I don't know what to do.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.068
You're going to be okay.

16:22.899 --> 16:24.106
Gabriel.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.107
Dr. Reese.

16:26.235 --> 16:29.524
- My pleasure to finally meet you.
- It's good to meet you.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.942
Why don't you come inside?

16:33.034 --> 16:35.151
Please, have a seat.

16:39.874 --> 16:42.708
Well, it's... Everything's white.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.202
Very... comforting.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.209
Precisely.

16:50.593 --> 16:53.336
I've looked at your medical records.

16:53.471 --> 16:56.805
Brain scan, MRIs seem normal.

16:58.059 --> 17:00.551
This seems psychologically based.

17:00.686 --> 17:03.099
I'm really just here for her.

17:03.231 --> 17:05.848
- Ah, Brinn.
- Yeah.

17:06.442 --> 17:10.106
So tell me about these dreams
you've been having.

17:10.238 --> 17:12.901
Sometimes they just feel real, that's all.

17:13.031 --> 17:15.523
Your wife said she found you
sleepwalking once.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.571
This is more like I wake up

17:17.703 --> 17:20.867
and I'm not really sure
if I was dreaming or not.

17:20.998 --> 17:24.537
Gabriel, the unconscious
dream can become...

17:25.502 --> 17:27.085
...borderline conscious.

17:27.213 --> 17:31.378
Like, you're awake
but you're still dreaming.

17:31.509 --> 17:35.423
You want to wake up and get
out of there, but you can't.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.138
To a certain extent, we all have these...

17:38.266 --> 17:40.633
so-called waking dreams.

17:40.768 --> 17:43.260
In my waking dreams...

17:44.313 --> 17:47.056
...I'm chasing people.

17:48.359 --> 17:50.146
I'm killing them.

17:51.028 --> 17:53.441
The mind stores everything.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.566
Television news, movies, billboards.

17:57.743 --> 18:00.451
And these thoughts, these visual cues,

18:00.580 --> 18:04.699
can return to us quite vividly
in waking dreams.

18:04.834 --> 18:07.497
How is your relationship with your wife?

18:07.628 --> 18:11.167
- What are you suggesting?
- I don't make suggestions, I ask questions.

18:11.299 --> 18:13.962
I don't know, we fight,
I guess, sometimes.

18:14.093 --> 18:17.928
She's shoved me a few times, but...
Am I going crazy?

18:19.432 --> 18:23.051
No. You're a hard-working man, Gabriel.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.427
And you're stressed.

18:25.563 --> 18:29.432
When I wake up from these dreams,
I get terrible headaches.

18:29.567 --> 18:32.651
If you can tolerate it,
aspirin would be best.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.737
I'm also going to put you
on a mild sedative.

18:35.865 --> 18:39.984
One tablet in the morning,
one tablet in the evening.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.904
And that's it? Just take a pill?

18:45.416 --> 18:47.078
Gabriel...

18:48.169 --> 18:52.630
...sometimes our problems are
not as complex as we'd hoped.

18:52.757 --> 18:56.125
This should help with the sleep
and the anxiety.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.840
Now tell me that song doesn't make you

18:59.972 --> 19:01.884
want to dial up
your old high-school sweetheart.

19:02.016 --> 19:05.100
Come on down to Estell's Department Store,
where you're always treated like family.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.560
Estell's, home away from home.

21:47.973 --> 21:52.513
The murder-suicide came as a shock
to friends and family, stating,

21:52.645 --> 21:56.138
- Jack Kenneth and his wife...
- That's not your job.

21:56.273 --> 21:59.266
Look, you... you don't understand.
I don't care.

21:59.401 --> 22:04.112
I don't care if they're left, or right,
or center. It's all the same game.

22:06.075 --> 22:07.407
Right.

22:08.536 --> 22:11.654
I understand that you don't understand.

22:20.631 --> 22:24.466
No, no, look, no, that's not your job.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.793
I'm catching a train.

22:28.055 --> 22:29.671
I'll call you later.

22:30.724 --> 22:34.092
- Hey, Officer, how you doing?
- Good.

22:36.438 --> 22:39.226
See that guy at the vending
machine over there?

22:39.358 --> 22:42.567
Little weird.
Just hope you keep an eye on him.

22:47.408 --> 22:50.151
- Can I help you?
- Yes, I'm late for a meeting.

22:50.286 --> 22:53.950
Is it the yellow or the red line to midtown?

22:54.081 --> 22:55.617
- Yellow.
- Yellow?

22:55.749 --> 22:57.456
Right over there.

23:41.049 --> 23:42.475
Freeze!

24:35.015 --> 24:36.881
Please!

24:37.351 --> 24:38.762
I have a...

25:21.145 --> 25:24.684
- Gabriel, what are you doing?
- Do not fucking touch me.

25:24.815 --> 25:28.149
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Back the fuck off.

25:30.154 --> 25:32.237
What happened to me last night?

25:32.364 --> 25:34.230
What do you mean?

25:34.366 --> 25:37.700
I want to know what happened
to me last night.

25:37.828 --> 25:40.366
I don't know. We went to work.
We served customers.

25:40.497 --> 25:43.911
Jesse liked the lamb stew,
we decided to put it on the menu.

25:44.043 --> 25:47.036
- What, is that what you wanted to know?
- Okay, what happened after?

25:47.171 --> 25:48.707
- After?
- Yeah.

25:48.839 --> 25:51.001
You stayed with Jesse. I went home.

25:51.133 --> 25:53.216
You guys talked about girls.

25:53.343 --> 25:56.177
You came home, you went to bed,
I woke you up.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.849
No, no, no, no! That is not what happened!

26:03.187 --> 26:05.474
Do not fucking lie to me.

26:06.356 --> 26:08.473
That is what happened, Gabriel.
It is what happened!

26:08.609 --> 26:11.443
- Do not fucking lie to me.
- I'm not fucking lying to you!

26:11.570 --> 26:14.904
- Bullshit. Bullshit, you aren't lying to me.
- Why would I lie to you? Why?

26:15.032 --> 26:17.274
- Why would I lie to you?
- I don't know!

26:17.409 --> 26:19.696
Because you think I'm fucking crazy!

26:19.828 --> 26:22.616
No, I think that you're sick.

26:22.748 --> 26:24.740
And that you need help.

26:26.085 --> 26:29.419
- There's something wrong with you.
- Jack Kenneth.

26:31.965 --> 26:34.298
- What?
- Jack Kenneth.

26:35.594 --> 26:39.679
In my dreams, the man I killed...
I looked him up.

26:39.807 --> 26:42.925
He's a fucking Washington, D.C. guy.
Look him up.

26:43.060 --> 26:45.017
Look him the fuck up.

26:46.271 --> 26:49.230
We all know that he was murdered, Gabriel.

26:49.358 --> 26:53.022
You're putting yourself in the news.
It's in your head.

26:58.242 --> 27:01.110
You need to talk to Dr. Reese again, okay?

27:01.245 --> 27:03.157
You need to go see him.

27:05.415 --> 27:08.203
'Cause I can't take this anymore.

28:02.431 --> 28:05.469
I need to... I need to wash my hands.

29:22.219 --> 29:23.835
Afternoon.

29:25.555 --> 29:27.296
Something I can do you for?

29:27.432 --> 29:30.015
Yes, um, is Sheriff Hodge in?

29:31.979 --> 29:33.720
He's on a call.

29:33.855 --> 29:36.017
I help you with anything?

29:36.149 --> 29:38.106
No, I'll... I'll wait.

29:38.235 --> 29:40.898
Well, he's kind of busy.

29:41.571 --> 29:44.234
This is kind of important, so...

29:44.366 --> 29:47.154
Sir, we said he's busy.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.994
Right, and I said I'll wait.

29:50.122 --> 29:54.082
What the hell's going on out there?

29:54.209 --> 29:56.326
Can I talk to you for one second, please?

29:56.461 --> 29:59.545
- Get on in here.
- Thank you.

29:59.673 --> 30:02.211
- Enjoy your doughnut.
- Huh.

30:05.220 --> 30:08.008
Okay, what's so urgent?

30:09.766 --> 30:13.601
This is going to sound crazy.
Okay, just please bear with me.

30:15.439 --> 30:17.396
Here we go, copies.

30:20.068 --> 30:23.232
These two men, they were killed.

30:23.363 --> 30:24.945
And they were killed while...

30:25.073 --> 30:27.531
they were doing something important.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.618
Gabriel, we know they were killed.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.200
You doing okay?

30:35.792 --> 30:37.328
How's Brinn?

30:38.086 --> 30:41.250
She's... She's fine, but listen.

30:41.381 --> 30:44.499
These men, right, that were killed,

30:44.634 --> 30:47.172
someone benefited from their death.

30:47.304 --> 30:51.844
Uh, that'll be all, Deputy,
and shut the door on your way out.

30:54.728 --> 30:59.098
Listen, both your parents
passing away last year,

30:59.232 --> 31:01.394
you taking over the diner,

31:02.778 --> 31:04.440
it's a full plate.

31:04.571 --> 31:06.278
You're doing a hell of a job.

31:06.406 --> 31:07.772
We're trying.

31:07.908 --> 31:11.652
You and I, let's hunt some deer
this fall, like old times.

31:11.787 --> 31:13.528
Okay?

31:22.089 --> 31:23.671
Truvio.

31:24.633 --> 31:26.966
He's having dangerous thoughts.

31:27.094 --> 31:29.256
Keep an eye on him.

31:36.770 --> 31:38.557
Hey, delivery come?

31:38.688 --> 31:40.725
Yeah, it's in the back.

31:42.609 --> 31:47.195
I also forgot to tell you that the
dishwasher's on the fritz again, man.

31:47.322 --> 31:49.154
Seriously?

31:49.282 --> 31:51.023
Working fine yesterday.

31:51.159 --> 31:55.654
Oh, I don't know.
I think it's the hydro line, though.

31:55.789 --> 31:58.748
If not, we'll have to replace
the whole damn thing,

31:58.875 --> 32:01.788
and I just cannot afford that right now.

32:01.920 --> 32:06.381
I'll run to the hardware store
after the morning rush.

32:06.508 --> 32:09.842
Till then, we'll just have
to wash them by hand.

32:09.970 --> 32:12.553
By we, you mean me, right?

32:13.682 --> 32:17.596
Underpaid and overworked,
heard it all before.

32:17.727 --> 32:19.138
Yeah.

32:53.180 --> 32:55.422
What the... Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, man.

32:55.557 --> 32:58.516
- What you doing, man?
- Who do you work for?

32:58.643 --> 33:01.260
- What are you talking about?
- Tell me, goddammit, tell me right now.

33:01.396 --> 33:03.228
- I don't know.
- Bullshit.

33:03.356 --> 33:04.892
- Who told you to play that song?
- Nobody!

33:05.025 --> 33:07.688
Do not lie to me, Jesse.
Who do you work for?

33:07.819 --> 33:11.859
You? Please, please don't hurt me, please.

33:39.142 --> 33:40.724
I'm sorry.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.263
You alright?

33:46.775 --> 33:50.234
I'm sorry, had a rough couple of days.

35:08.481 --> 35:10.689
What was I supposed to do, man?

35:10.817 --> 35:14.527
You're scaring us, dude.
You're acting insane, bro.

38:06.201 --> 38:09.990
Goddammit, open the door!
Right now, open it!

38:10.121 --> 38:14.081
Open the goddamn door,
or I'm calling the police!

38:17.837 --> 38:21.421
- What the fuck is the matter with you?
- What is the matter with you?

38:21.549 --> 38:23.415
Am I so unbearable to live with?

38:23.551 --> 38:27.545
You can't sleep one night
without having a goddamn nightmare!

38:27.680 --> 38:29.387
- Really?
- What is wrong with you?

38:29.516 --> 38:32.509
- No, what is wrong with you?
- There's nothing wrong with me!

38:32.644 --> 38:34.180
It's you!

38:34.312 --> 38:36.679
I found the fucking video camera!

38:36.815 --> 38:39.603
What are you, a sick freak?

38:39.734 --> 38:42.818
What are you trying to do?
Film us or something? You...

38:42.946 --> 38:46.735
No. No, you need to stop!
Fucking kidding me? Really?

40:07.322 --> 40:09.029
What's it like?

40:10.909 --> 40:12.821
Sometimes...

40:15.413 --> 40:17.826
...I can feel my heartbeat.

40:22.921 --> 40:28.258
I just can't bring myself
to admit that it's just a dream.

40:29.844 --> 40:34.930
And I want to believe you, I do.
But... if what you're saying is true,

40:35.058 --> 40:37.345
then none of this is real.

40:38.311 --> 40:41.975
The diner, the town, our house.

40:42.106 --> 40:43.642
Me.

40:50.531 --> 40:52.272
Feel that?

40:54.452 --> 40:56.068
That's real.

40:59.666 --> 41:03.285
What we have is good
and worth fighting for.

41:10.134 --> 41:13.002
The dreams, they're getting worse?

41:13.137 --> 41:15.094
They're not dreams.

41:15.223 --> 41:17.966
So... they're reality.

41:18.810 --> 41:22.099
- Who do you work for?
- If you allow me to do my job, maybe you'll...

41:22.230 --> 41:24.347
I want to know who you are.

41:24.482 --> 41:28.897
I want to know the Reese
behind the smile, the handshake.

41:29.988 --> 41:32.071
The sterile white bullshit.

41:34.909 --> 41:37.026
We're focusing on you.

41:38.037 --> 41:40.074
Are you hearing voices now?

41:40.206 --> 41:43.825
Right, go ahead,
try to make me doubt myself now.

41:43.960 --> 41:46.873
Is that what you think I'm doing?

41:51.592 --> 41:54.130
Are you still having violent thoughts?

41:55.054 --> 41:58.013
I'm starting to really enjoy killing.

41:58.141 --> 42:01.384
The more I do it, the more fun it gets.

42:02.645 --> 42:06.480
- Do you want my help or not?
- Where did you study psychiatry?

42:08.109 --> 42:11.022
With the loss of your parents,
your long working hours,

42:11.154 --> 42:14.238
your lack of sleep,
the lack of trust in your relationship,

42:14.365 --> 42:16.607
the lack of children in your marriage,

42:16.743 --> 42:20.532
all of this loss
and frustration in your life...

42:22.123 --> 42:26.037
...you may be unleashing
all this depression and frustration

42:26.169 --> 42:29.412
by lashing out in these violent dreams.

42:32.467 --> 42:36.256
I must say, I'm becoming very concerned
about your lack of progress,

42:36.387 --> 42:38.629
and for the safety of your wife.

42:38.765 --> 42:42.600
Brinn told me you threw out your medication,
replaced it with ibuprofen.

42:42.727 --> 42:46.892
Migraines got worse
and my dreams got more vivid.

42:47.023 --> 42:50.391
Gabriel, you didn't take the pills.

42:51.486 --> 42:53.022
You threw them out.

42:55.114 --> 42:56.650
I'll be right back.

43:12.715 --> 43:15.082
So, Gabriel...

43:19.347 --> 43:22.715
This is a much higher dose
of sedative than the last time.

43:22.850 --> 43:26.890
It should keep you from making
any dangerous decisions.

43:28.189 --> 43:29.771
Thank you.

53:30.040 --> 53:31.372
Track him.

56:10.576 --> 56:11.862
Hey!

57:24.942 --> 57:26.433
Turn around.

57:33.784 --> 57:37.368
I'm having another violent dream, Doctor.

57:37.496 --> 57:40.204
Brinn's been worried sick about you.

57:40.332 --> 57:43.825
She's been looking
for you everywhere, Gabriel.

57:43.961 --> 57:46.169
Have you hurt yourself?

57:46.296 --> 57:48.709
Do you want me to take you
to an emergency room?

57:48.840 --> 57:52.709
Cut... cut the "first do
no harm" bullshit, okay?

57:52.844 --> 57:54.301
Alright?

57:55.305 --> 57:57.922
Who are the Sons of Liberty? Hmm?

58:00.310 --> 58:02.848
I'm just moving offices, Gabriel.

58:02.980 --> 58:06.564
I only came here to collect
your confidential medical records.

58:07.359 --> 58:08.850
No, it's not Gabriel.

58:08.986 --> 58:12.400
I'm not Gabriel, and you aren't Dr. Reese.

58:13.573 --> 58:15.155
Okay.

58:16.034 --> 58:17.775
Who am I?

58:17.911 --> 58:20.403
Hmm, Dr. Anton maybe.

58:21.248 --> 58:23.581
Hmm? Does that sound right?

58:23.709 --> 58:26.577
And this... this lady...

58:27.504 --> 58:29.712
She was your wife.

58:30.841 --> 58:34.209
I don't know what you're talking about.

58:36.054 --> 58:39.013
- Look, my arms are tired. Can I...
- Fine.

58:39.850 --> 58:43.309
Your denying this will not save your life.

58:49.359 --> 58:51.476
It was a car accident.

58:52.779 --> 58:55.192
And I loved my wife.

58:56.742 --> 59:00.031
Gives you no right to do
what you did. None.

59:00.162 --> 59:02.529
You didn't give me meds for anxiety,

59:02.664 --> 59:06.203
you gave me meds
because I was remembering shit.

59:06.334 --> 59:10.248
I didn't want to hurt you, Gabriel!
You've got to believe me.

59:10.380 --> 59:13.373
You and Brinn are wonderful people.

59:13.508 --> 59:15.545
I want the best for you.

59:15.677 --> 59:18.715
I never wanted to do you any harm.

59:18.847 --> 59:21.510
You and countless others on a grand scale.

59:21.641 --> 59:23.724
Now you're sounding crazy.

59:25.479 --> 59:28.096
You were just a killing machine,

59:28.231 --> 59:31.599
but this project is independently funded.

59:32.569 --> 59:35.152
- The government.
- No, not exactly.

59:35.572 --> 59:38.986
But we're making great strides
in perfecting it.

59:40.243 --> 59:42.200
You won't stop them,

59:43.330 --> 59:47.995
and you will never stop me
from trying to bring back my wife.

01:00:02.307 --> 01:00:05.220
Go around back! You, come with me.

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:20.745
Brinn?

01:04:36.498 --> 01:04:38.034
Get up.

01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:40.369
- What are you doing?
- Get the fuck up.

01:04:40.502 --> 01:04:43.540
What are you doing? I'm scared right now!

01:04:43.671 --> 01:04:45.458
What are you doing? What are you doing?

01:04:45.590 --> 01:04:49.083
- What am I doing? Are you in on it?
- Stop, you're scaring me right now.

01:04:49.219 --> 01:04:50.801
- Are you in on it?
- In on what?

01:04:50.929 --> 01:04:53.763
- Are you in on it?
- In on what? Gabriel, stop! Stop!

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:57.099
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Bullshit! Don't lie to me.

01:04:57.227 --> 01:05:01.312
I'm not really in the mood
for lies right now. Sit down.

01:05:01.439 --> 01:05:03.305
Tell me the fucking truth.

01:05:03.441 --> 01:05:07.459
- I don't know.
- Bullshit! Goddammit, Brinn!

01:05:07.594 --> 01:05:10.938
Hodge has been chasing me all fucking day.

01:05:11.674 --> 01:05:13.441
All fucking day!

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:16.819
Put the gun down,
you're acting fucking insane.

01:05:16.955 --> 01:05:18.617
I'm acting insane?

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:21.115
I just spoke with Dr. Reese,

01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:24.415
the doctor that you fucking sent me to!

01:05:24.546 --> 01:05:27.914
- How much did you fucking betray me?
- I didn't! I don't know.

01:05:28.049 --> 01:05:29.836
Bullshit! Goddammit!

01:05:30.844 --> 01:05:32.585
Goddammit.

01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:37.928
- You're acting fucking crazy right now.
- Shut up.

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:44.396
Gabriel, please, please don't hurt me,
please. Gabriel, I'm your wife.

01:05:44.524 --> 01:05:46.891
- Tell me, I know you're my wife.
- Baby, it's me!

01:05:47.026 --> 01:05:49.609
- Please tell me.
- It's me, it's Brinn! I didn't do anything!

01:05:49.737 --> 01:05:52.445
Tell me everything that you fucking know
about Sons of Liberty.

01:05:52.574 --> 01:05:54.315
- Tell me, I swear...
- You're hurting me!

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:56.659
- I need to fucking know something!
- You're hurting me!

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:59.278
I don't care! I don't care.

01:05:59.414 --> 01:06:01.781
You fucking ruined my life!

01:06:02.834 --> 01:06:05.998
You fucking broke my heart.
What the fuck are you doing to me?

01:06:06.129 --> 01:06:08.462
Okay! Okay.

01:06:10.508 --> 01:06:12.591
I'm not your wife.

01:06:14.179 --> 01:06:16.466
- What?
- I was...

01:06:16.598 --> 01:06:18.464
recruited a year ago, but I didn't know

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:22.719
that I would meet you and I didn't know
I would fall in love with you, and...

01:06:22.854 --> 01:06:25.847
and I did it because they hired me!

01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:29.771
Because I had legal problems,
I had money problems.

01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:32.646
But it wasn't supposed to be like this.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:34.942
I promise you, it wasn't.

01:06:35.074 --> 01:06:38.317
And they're bad people and I realized it.

01:06:38.453 --> 01:06:42.288
How could you do that to someone?
How could you do that me? Why?

01:06:44.209 --> 01:06:45.950
I'm sorry.

01:06:46.628 --> 01:06:48.164
I'm so sorry.

01:06:48.296 --> 01:06:49.958
Don't fucking touch me.

01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:53.173
I promise you I just thought
that it was for the money,

01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:56.009
but I didn't know that I would meet you.

01:06:56.137 --> 01:06:59.301
I loved you. You were my fucking wife.

01:07:01.684 --> 01:07:03.801
Do you even know who I am?

01:07:28.002 --> 01:07:29.664
Shit. That window.

01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:31.662
Window, window, window.

01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:40.467
Hey!

01:07:42.767 --> 01:07:44.804
Brinn is innocent.

01:07:45.436 --> 01:07:47.393
It's your call, Gabriel.

01:07:59.784 --> 01:08:02.618
Jesus, what the fuck took you so long?

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:05.158
We took a nice scenic river drive.

01:08:05.290 --> 01:08:08.374
He's good, but he ain't better than us.

01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:13.587
I've been waiting all day to do that.

01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:17.631
What happened to you, soldier?

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:42.987
Let Reese know he's awake.

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:52.456
- What happened?
- It's best... if you just relax.

01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:03.345
You've been here before.
Nothing to worry about.

01:09:12.106 --> 01:09:15.224
Stop struggling, I'm trying to help you.

01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:46.005
No, you motherfuck!
Fuck you. I'm gonna fucking kill you.

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:47.801
Fuckers.

01:09:55.983 --> 01:09:57.190
Fucker.

01:10:01.823 --> 01:10:04.156
If it's any comfort,

01:10:04.283 --> 01:10:08.323
know that when you wake up,
you won't remember any of this.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.397
Gabriel, stay with us.

01:13:03.963 --> 01:13:05.579
You motherfucker.

01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:09.254
I want you to put your hands
behind your head,

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:12.219
interlock your fingers and turn around.

01:13:13.973 --> 01:13:15.305
Slower.

01:13:22.481 --> 01:13:24.097
Is anyone else here?

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:28.401
I'm unarmed.

01:13:30.698 --> 01:13:32.655
Where are we?

01:13:32.783 --> 01:13:35.992
This is where you were born, Gabriel.

01:13:41.459 --> 01:13:43.075
You won't get out.

01:13:43.210 --> 01:13:46.248
Right now, I just need
a reason not to kill you.

01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:48.667
- Because you can't live
without knowing the answer

01:13:48.799 --> 01:13:52.258
to the question that's burning inside you.

01:13:52.386 --> 01:13:54.002
Let's take a walk.

01:13:56.724 --> 01:14:01.264
That's an awful lot of oxygen and air
to run an underground facility, huh?

01:14:02.313 --> 01:14:03.679
Hold up there.

01:14:10.696 --> 01:14:13.564
Really only going to ask one thing:

01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:15.986
Who are the Sons of Liberty?

01:14:18.913 --> 01:14:20.529
Aah!

01:14:28.589 --> 01:14:31.457
"An organization of American colonists,

01:14:31.592 --> 01:14:33.959
"a secret society to fight British taxation

01:14:34.095 --> 01:14:39.807
known for undertaking
the Boston Tea Party in 1773."

01:14:41.143 --> 01:14:44.352
I have a feeling that they still exist.

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:47.689
Oh, my God,
I'm killing people who are fighting

01:14:47.817 --> 01:14:51.401
for real liberty so they can keep control?

01:14:51.529 --> 01:14:53.270
Jesus, fuck.

01:14:55.741 --> 01:14:57.573
Very good, Gabriel.

01:14:57.702 --> 01:14:59.318
Get up.

01:15:14.093 --> 01:15:15.584
Everybody get out.

01:15:20.391 --> 01:15:24.510
Before you go too far,
I need to show you something.

01:15:25.062 --> 01:15:28.521
I know they're coming for me.
We need to keep moving.

01:15:29.108 --> 01:15:31.976
You still don't know who you are.

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:45.072
Initially, I grew skin for burn victims.

01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:49.326
Then I started doing the research
nobody would dare do.

01:15:50.629 --> 01:15:52.461
Limb reanimation.

01:15:53.257 --> 01:15:55.965
Brain-tissue regeneration.

01:15:56.093 --> 01:15:59.382
Trying to figure out
how the human body works.

01:16:00.139 --> 01:16:02.973
And then learning how to duplicate it.

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:06.059
So you could bring back your wife?

01:16:08.105 --> 01:16:10.313
She was everything to me.

01:16:11.484 --> 01:16:14.192
Then the fine people
at the American Medical Association

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.812
had me arrested for unsanctioned research.

01:16:16.947 --> 01:16:21.237
Sons of Liberty had the charges dropped,
faked my death,

01:16:21.368 --> 01:16:25.408
and wrote me a blank cheque
to continue my research.

01:16:26.373 --> 01:16:27.659
Gabriel.

01:16:31.670 --> 01:16:33.411
Meet Daniel.

01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:38.004
Yes, it's you.

01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:42.303
Daniel Lucas Forney,

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:43.888
Navy SEAL,

01:16:44.016 --> 01:16:46.929
noted for his exceptional
sharpshooting skills,

01:16:47.061 --> 01:16:50.020
black ops in Iraq, Kuwait, Columbia.

01:16:51.273 --> 01:16:54.186
First do no harm, that was my goal.

01:16:56.946 --> 01:16:58.903
We cleared every room.

01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:03.067
There were dozens of them.

01:17:04.995 --> 01:17:08.705
But they were all just mothers,

01:17:08.833 --> 01:17:12.577
trying to...
trying to protect their fucking kids.

01:17:12.711 --> 01:17:14.703
Cut the camera.

01:17:16.006 --> 01:17:19.124
Get a grip, boy. Come on, sit up.

01:17:20.094 --> 01:17:21.835
You're my bitch now.

01:17:21.971 --> 01:17:26.636
No, I'm not your bitch now.
Okay, I volunteered for this shit.

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:33.605
Welcome to the program, Gabriel.

01:17:33.732 --> 01:17:35.473
Sedate him.

01:17:36.735 --> 01:17:38.692
I'll fucking kill him!

01:17:41.031 --> 01:17:42.647
Oh, my God!

01:17:44.243 --> 01:17:47.702
Daniel Forney was the best assassin

01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:50.288
the American military ever had.

01:17:50.416 --> 01:17:53.284
You erased my fucking memory?

01:17:53.419 --> 01:17:56.912
Programmed me like a fucking machine?

01:17:57.047 --> 01:17:59.080
Triggered to be active,
kill on command now.

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:02.755
Wow, that's fucking great,
fucking great! Jesus.

01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:10.767
Who the hell is Hodge?

01:18:10.895 --> 01:18:14.559
Your commanding officer,
before he was recruited by SOL.

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:15.806
Brinn?

01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:20.777
Her job was to be an emotional anchor
for the incarnations of Gabriel.

01:18:22.615 --> 01:18:24.322
There are others?

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:40.838
We call them shadows.

01:18:40.966 --> 01:18:44.130
But, yes, they are clones.

01:18:50.893 --> 01:18:52.930
13 shadows,

01:18:53.062 --> 01:18:55.349
13 elimination targets.

01:18:56.190 --> 01:18:57.806
But not yet perfected,

01:18:57.942 --> 01:19:03.313
which is why you had to create
a false life in between missions.

01:19:03.447 --> 01:19:06.406
Keep the shadows from going mad, right?

01:19:06.533 --> 01:19:10.243
We had to reanimate immediately
on the death of the previous.

01:19:12.373 --> 01:19:16.743
I had no idea that the memory threads
would jump from clone to clone like twins.

01:19:16.877 --> 01:19:18.994
Really, I didn't.

01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:22.122
But you see...

01:19:22.258 --> 01:19:24.591
this is a pilot program.

01:19:25.511 --> 01:19:29.471
My ultimate goal
is to eliminate human soldiers.

01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:37.642
I'm sorry, Gabriel.

01:19:53.372 --> 01:19:55.489
You go round back.

01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:02.421
I see he at least showed you
your old self on the monitor.

01:20:02.548 --> 01:20:05.131
But Gabriel, you're not Daniel.

01:20:06.468 --> 01:20:08.084
There's more of you.

01:20:09.221 --> 01:20:11.804
Your dream of freedom, it's over.

01:20:12.891 --> 01:20:16.100
World's got too many people now,

01:20:16.228 --> 01:20:17.810
too few resources.

01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:23.191
You're a damn good shot.

01:20:25.279 --> 01:20:27.566
How many rounds you got left?

01:20:27.698 --> 01:20:29.234
12?

01:20:29.366 --> 01:20:31.733
Maybe 15?

01:20:31.869 --> 01:20:33.656
Enough.

01:20:35.372 --> 01:20:37.455
The elevators are locked.

01:20:37.583 --> 01:20:41.122
There's 300 feet of earth
between you and the sun.

01:20:41.503 --> 01:20:44.996
What the fuck do you care about
the rest of anything, anyhow?

01:20:45.132 --> 01:20:47.715
I'm done being your puppet.

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:50.836
Last person I'm going to kill is you, sir.

01:21:04.443 --> 01:21:06.400
What are you doing here?

01:21:36.809 --> 01:21:41.304
Please cease operations
and leave the building

01:21:41.438 --> 01:21:44.021
utilizing the nearest exit...

01:21:46.026 --> 01:21:47.938
I can handle it, sir.

01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:58.862
Take Gabriel alive.

01:21:58.997 --> 01:22:03.037
Once an animal escapes,
it'll never go domestic again.

01:22:03.168 --> 01:22:07.003
I spent years of research on that boy!
I'm not allowing you...

01:22:07.131 --> 01:22:10.670
Are you the hunter or the scientist here?

01:22:10.801 --> 01:22:13.088
Now get back to the surface!

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:39.865
Please cease operations

01:22:39.997 --> 01:22:43.365
and leave the building
utilizing the nearest exit,

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:46.243
- or fire exit.
- Open this gate, you cunt!

01:22:54.386 --> 01:22:58.380
Come on, Gabe, we've got to move.
Gabe, come on, we have to move, come on.

01:22:58.515 --> 01:23:00.552
No, I can't make it.

01:23:00.684 --> 01:23:03.848
Please, the gate is not gonna hold them,
it's not gonna hold them.

01:23:03.979 --> 01:23:07.313
Look at me. I need you to do
something for me. Can you?

01:23:07.441 --> 01:23:10.809
I need you to break him out, okay?

01:23:10.944 --> 01:23:14.358
When one dies, the other one is activated.

01:23:14.490 --> 01:23:17.528
- Stay with me.
- Look at me.

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:19.275
I fucking love you.

01:23:21.411 --> 01:23:23.450
I wish it was different.

01:23:24.625 --> 01:23:26.992
Stay with me, stay with me.

01:23:28.295 --> 01:23:30.378
Oh, God. Oh, God!

01:24:11.922 --> 01:24:13.379
Dr. Reese.

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:17.838
- Everything's gone to hell.
- I suspected.

01:24:19.137 --> 01:24:20.878
And Hodge?

01:24:21.014 --> 01:24:23.427
No one's getting out of there.

01:24:24.017 --> 01:24:25.758
You did what you could.

01:24:51.461 --> 01:24:54.704
Come on, Gabe. Gabe!

01:24:55.173 --> 01:24:57.415
Gabe, Gabe!

01:24:59.011 --> 01:25:01.799
Come on, come on.

01:25:06.935 --> 01:25:09.177
Six, seven, eight,

01:25:09.313 --> 01:25:11.270
nine, 10...

01:25:22.534 --> 01:25:25.743
Come on! Two, three, four, five, six.

01:25:25.871 --> 01:25:28.409
Come on, come on, Gabriel!

01:25:32.127 --> 01:25:33.618
Come on!

01:25:34.588 --> 01:25:36.295
Come on!

01:25:37.507 --> 01:25:38.839
Oh, my God.

01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:50.719
You think I don't know every twitch
you're going to throw?

01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:54.727
Remember 15-year-old Malika?

01:25:56.026 --> 01:25:57.938
Killed in Iraq?

01:25:59.029 --> 01:26:00.941
I picked up that pipe.

01:26:02.032 --> 01:26:04.900
She screamed, "What do you want?

01:26:05.035 --> 01:26:07.778
Want me to tell you you can rape me?"

01:26:07.913 --> 01:26:11.281
And I said, "We take what we want.

01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:16.832
And what we don't want, we kill."

01:26:18.256 --> 01:26:23.593
Now I'm getting tired...
of this cat-and-mouse bullshit.

01:27:00.966 --> 01:27:05.131
Relax, I'm not going to kill the Brinn.

01:27:07.472 --> 01:27:09.054
He is.

01:27:10.308 --> 01:27:12.675
On your feet, soldier.

01:27:15.105 --> 01:27:16.437
Gabriel.

01:27:17.190 --> 01:27:18.897
He couldn't deal.

01:27:19.025 --> 01:27:20.561
PTSD.

01:27:20.694 --> 01:27:22.777
- Gabriel.
- Nightmares.

01:27:25.407 --> 01:27:27.774
That's my only regret.

01:27:27.909 --> 01:27:30.652
Gabriel, remember who you are.

01:27:30.787 --> 01:27:32.574
- That I didn't kill him sooner.
- Gabriel.

01:27:32.706 --> 01:27:35.039
- Gabe, Gabe!
- Pick up that gun.

01:27:35.167 --> 01:27:37.409
No, Gabriel. It's me, Brinn.

01:27:37.544 --> 01:27:40.252
- Go ahead, pick it up.
- Gabriel, don't do it.

01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:45.796
Gabe, please, remember who you are!
Please, Gabriel. It's me, Brinn.

01:27:47.262 --> 01:27:49.424
- Please remember who you are.
- Aim...

01:27:49.556 --> 01:27:52.139
You're not a killer. You're not a killer!

01:27:53.059 --> 01:27:54.391
Gabriel.

01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:58.263
- Go ahead... aim.
- Oh, no...

01:27:59.566 --> 01:28:03.310
- Gabriel, please, please! No! Please!
- Now fire. Go ahead, fire.

01:28:03.445 --> 01:28:06.938
- Gabriel, no, please, please!
- Shoot her! Fire!

01:28:07.073 --> 01:28:08.439
Gabriel!

01:28:19.961 --> 01:28:21.327
Gabriel.

01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:25.214
Gabriel. Oh, my God. Oh!

01:28:25.342 --> 01:28:28.676
...leave the building utilizing
the nearest exit or the fire exit.

01:28:28.804 --> 01:28:31.888
Do not use elevators. Repeat...

01:28:32.015 --> 01:28:34.758
Shit. Oh, shit, there's smoke.

01:28:36.394 --> 01:28:39.228
- Shit, there's gas everywhere.
- We gotta go.

01:28:40.582 --> 01:28:42.269
Clothes.

01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:49.234
Shit... it's not working.

01:29:09.177 --> 01:29:12.887
Alright, so listen.
Babe, listen to me. Hold on, listen.

01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:16.473
You need to hang on really tight, okay?
And then when you get to the top...

01:29:16.601 --> 01:29:20.060
- No, no, you're coming with me.
- I can't.

01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:23.101
No, you have to, please.
Please, I came back for you, Gabriel.

01:29:23.233 --> 01:29:26.397
- No, no, no, babe, I'm not afraid.
- I'm not leaving you down here!

01:29:26.528 --> 01:29:29.066
You have to.
I'm a killer and this is where...

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:31.154
No, you're not a killer!

01:29:31.283 --> 01:29:35.118
No, you're number 13,
you're my lucky number.

01:29:35.245 --> 01:29:40.081
You're not a killer, you can go with me,
we'll start a new life together, please.

01:29:40.208 --> 01:29:41.699
I can't.

01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:45.373
This is the closest I've ever been.

01:29:46.756 --> 01:29:48.748
- Sorry, I'm sorry.
- No.

01:29:48.884 --> 01:29:52.002
Look, look, look, you have
to tell everyone what they did.

01:29:52.137 --> 01:29:56.177
You have to make it. I'm so fucking
happy you came back for me,

01:29:56.308 --> 01:30:00.302
but you need to go,
you need to go right now, okay? Okay?

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:03.221
Okay, no, please.

01:30:43.521 --> 01:30:47.356
Darling, are you feeling sick again?

01:30:48.305 --> 01:30:54.175
