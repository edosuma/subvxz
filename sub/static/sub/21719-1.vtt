05:15.225 --> 05:16.770
Adele?

05:18.061 --> 05:19.907
It's you!

05:20.296 --> 05:24.111
Where have you been?
We've been so worried about you.

05:25.201 --> 05:28.816
Why? You okay?

05:32.108 --> 05:35.432
What did you do? What did you do?

05:35.512 --> 05:37.892
What did you do? What did you do?

05:37.972 --> 05:40.604
Adele, what did you do?

07:06.336 --> 07:11.418
Zoey, hey. What are you fussing about?

07:17.580 --> 07:21.195
How can such a little baby
make so much noise?

07:23.686 --> 07:25.232
Zoey.

07:27.490 --> 07:29.970
Hey, it's okay.

07:38.168 --> 07:40.247
Is there any sign of him?

07:42.105 --> 07:43.650
No.

07:46.943 --> 07:48.823
He should be here by now.

07:55.785 --> 07:57.831
Sure everything's fine.

08:00.857 --> 08:05.066
Mom, why don't you just...
sit down and relax.

08:09.666 --> 08:11.745
They should've been here by now.

08:31.988 --> 08:34.469
Looks like someone wants Nana.

08:35.592 --> 08:38.639
Oh, God. Look at you.

08:39.929 --> 08:43.376
Look at you. Yeah.

08:44.601 --> 08:46.680
Everybody likes you.

08:54.943 --> 08:58.125
Don't bother. Reception up here is for shit.

09:04.587 --> 09:07.067
Daddy's coming home soon.

09:11.894 --> 09:15.786
I'm sorry, can I have her back?
I know I'm crazy.

09:15.866 --> 09:19.079
Oh, no. You're a mom.

09:19.886 --> 09:21.590
There you go.

10:23.866 --> 10:26.546
- What's wrong?
- It's the tire.

10:56.332 --> 10:58.031
What the fuck?

11:00.903 --> 11:02.883
Get on the fucking ground now.

11:12.882 --> 11:14.324
Hey!

11:15.485 --> 11:18.732
- What is this?
- Get on the fucking ground now.

11:19.572 --> 11:21.385
On your stomach!

11:22.558 --> 11:24.384
Get up.

11:24.464 --> 11:27.884
Come on. Get up. Get up.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.360
You good? It's time.

13:11.934 --> 13:14.781
Hey, Campbell, give us a hand here, will you.

13:24.480 --> 13:27.369
- What happened to you?
- It's nothing.

13:27.449 --> 13:29.296
Let's get him inside.

13:32.555 --> 13:34.568
You grab his legs, okay.

13:52.374 --> 13:54.187
Let's get him upstairs.

13:58.351 --> 14:01.452
Mom, come on, let's go!

14:08.613 --> 14:09.769
Okay.

14:12.728 --> 14:14.974
Okay, right.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.115
Alright, get the jacket off.

14:29.812 --> 14:31.358
Okay.

14:36.552 --> 14:40.367
What the hell? Jesus.

14:57.873 --> 14:59.719
Tie him up.

15:40.916 --> 15:43.506
- Mom.
- Hey.

15:46.288 --> 15:48.744
Yes, it's me, Justin.

15:48.824 --> 15:52.305
I'm here, baby. I'm here, it's me.

15:53.496 --> 15:55.308
Easy, Kathy.

15:56.232 --> 15:58.377
Cam, what are you doing?

16:07.376 --> 16:09.856
It's gonna be okay, Justin.

16:11.714 --> 16:14.762
- What is this shit?
- Justin.

16:16.285 --> 16:17.864
Hey.

16:21.450 --> 16:25.391
- He's gonna break it.
- Take it easy, okay. I'm sorry.

16:25.471 --> 16:27.760
The ropes are a necessity
right now. I'm sorry.

16:28.160 --> 16:32.488
- Who the hell are you?
- My name is Jimmy. I'm here to help you.

16:32.568 --> 16:34.434
We're all here to help you.

16:39.308 --> 16:42.155
You should all think
about helping yourselves.

16:47.983 --> 16:52.065
- Justin.
- My name is not Justin!

16:56.993 --> 17:01.884
Your name's not Justin.
Alright. It's my mistake.

17:01.964 --> 17:03.510
You untie me now.

17:03.590 --> 17:07.646
You're not getting out of that chair
until you start making some sense.

17:12.942 --> 17:15.412
- Calm down.
- Jesus.

17:15.492 --> 17:18.134
- Calm down, Justin!
- I'm not Justin!

17:18.214 --> 17:21.170
You're not Justin? Your family
told me your name was Justin.

17:21.250 --> 17:23.630
They're not my family.

17:24.119 --> 17:26.242
Well, I'm pretty sure
that's your father, Andrew.

17:26.323 --> 17:28.401
This is your mother, Kathy.

17:28.958 --> 17:33.240
Your brother, Campbell.
And your girlfriend, Samantha.

17:37.466 --> 17:39.216
And this is your baby.

17:42.872 --> 17:45.795
- Thanatos
- Excuse me.

17:45.875 --> 17:47.632
Thanatos.

17:47.712 --> 17:49.856
Thanatos? Is that your name?

17:50.026 --> 17:51.801
Thanatos.

17:51.881 --> 17:54.894
So who named you that
because it wasn't your parents?

17:57.586 --> 17:59.132
No.

18:00.422 --> 18:02.469
My real family.

18:04.560 --> 18:08.027
Listen to me, Justin. Your family
is very concerned about you.

18:08.107 --> 18:10.327
They wanna talk to Justin.

18:13.869 --> 18:15.682
What's going on, Justin?

18:16.939 --> 18:19.466
Talk to me. We were just talking here.

18:20.676 --> 18:22.722
Come on, man.

18:23.112 --> 18:24.991
Open your eyes.

18:26.982 --> 18:28.528
Son.

18:30.753 --> 18:32.802
Look at these pigs.

18:32.882 --> 18:35.302
Lined up for slaughter.

18:35.791 --> 18:38.314
You greased hogs.

18:38.394 --> 18:41.118
- Waiting for the knife.
- No.

18:42.031 --> 18:43.810
Untie me now.

18:43.899 --> 18:46.381
Or I will watch you suffer...

18:46.461 --> 18:48.711
...and bleed.

18:48.791 --> 18:52.212
Bleed out like the fucking pigs you are!

18:52.292 --> 18:56.633
I will bathe your blood
the whole fucking lot of you!

18:56.713 --> 18:58.268
That's enough.

18:58.348 --> 19:02.171
No... my son would never
talk to me like that.

19:02.351 --> 19:06.120
Here, piggy, piggy, piggy,
piggy, piggy, piggy.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.135
You little piece of shit!

19:09.525 --> 19:12.621
Get off of him! Get off of him!

19:12.851 --> 19:14.504
Come get me, Campbell.

19:14.584 --> 19:17.952
When was the last time
you ever protected anybody?

19:18.032 --> 19:20.907
Your window of opportunity
is closing piggies.

19:20.987 --> 19:23.269
Untie me now or suffer the...

19:36.152 --> 19:38.835
Why are you looking at her like that?

19:39.822 --> 19:43.436
This is your little girl. Our little girl.

19:44.093 --> 19:46.139
What the hell is wrong with you?

19:48.280 --> 19:52.011
That's it! Everybody out.
Out! Out! Out of the room.

20:03.879 --> 20:06.189
Jesus Christ, Campbell. You gotta calm down.

20:06.269 --> 20:07.474
Fuck off!

20:07.554 --> 20:10.172
Look, I know what you're going through.

20:10.252 --> 20:13.008
- I've been there.
- Yeah, the hell you have.

20:13.088 --> 20:17.329
Look, we got your brother back alive.
Alright? So that's a start.

20:20.019 --> 20:23.599
- Sorry about that.
- That's alright. Let's focus on Justin now.

20:23.679 --> 20:26.212
What have they done to him?
That's not my boy.

20:26.292 --> 20:29.013
They brain washed him. And they've
done a pretty good job on him.

20:29.093 --> 20:32.628
I don't even know who that is
up there. That's not my son.

20:32.708 --> 20:36.498
- It's some kind of animal.
- We've talked about this, okay?

20:36.578 --> 20:39.391
He doesn't seem like himself,
but it is Justin up there.

20:39.471 --> 20:42.472
Keep reminding yourself. That is your son.

20:42.552 --> 20:44.573
That's your brother.

20:44.653 --> 20:48.744
Your boyfriend. There's a lot
I can do to try and bring him back.

20:48.824 --> 20:51.237
But I can't if you give up on him.

20:51.693 --> 20:56.114
He needs to know that you still love him.
That you're going to accept him.

20:56.194 --> 21:00.122
Once he lets go all this bullshit
that that monster put into his head.

21:00.202 --> 21:03.352
It's not an easy task. I'm gonna ask you
to do some of the hardest things...

21:03.432 --> 21:05.928
...you've ever done in your whole life.

21:06.008 --> 21:09.405
And when I ask you to,
you're gonna do them. No questions.

21:09.485 --> 21:13.809
We need to reach inside,
find Justin and bring him back.

21:14.015 --> 21:16.275
And I can't do that without you.

21:17.019 --> 21:18.898
Is that understood?

21:21.190 --> 21:22.735
Campbell?

21:24.493 --> 21:25.719
Fine.

21:26.262 --> 21:28.341
I gotta get back upstairs.

21:30.499 --> 21:32.712
You guys just try and relax for a while.

21:34.670 --> 21:36.403
I'll let you know when I need you.

21:41.343 --> 21:45.014
- Well, I need a cigarette.
- When did you start smoking?

21:45.094 --> 21:46.997
Right around the time you left.

22:26.422 --> 22:28.051
Thanatos.

22:37.749 --> 22:41.044
Normal folks, they...
they don't understand, do they?

22:45.507 --> 22:47.920
Freedom. Power.

22:49.611 --> 22:51.658
They're just stuck in there.

22:52.014 --> 22:56.463
Your world, a nine to five job,
dealing with mortgages and bills.

22:57.085 --> 22:58.908
While you're just a kid.

22:59.388 --> 23:03.269
Everybody's telling you
don't do this, don't do that, right?

23:04.193 --> 23:05.947
Your new family...

23:06.027 --> 23:09.118
...they don't use that word don't, do they?

23:09.198 --> 23:11.477
It's not in their vocabulary.

23:12.968 --> 23:16.649
They don't punish indulgence.
They applaud it.

23:18.874 --> 23:20.829
Must be something.

23:20.909 --> 23:24.357
You're gonna do whatever you want,
whenever you want.

23:25.147 --> 23:26.926
Sin without consequence.

23:31.086 --> 23:34.100
Took a hell of a time
getting your brother off you.

23:34.289 --> 23:36.503
I don't think he likes me very much.

23:37.893 --> 23:41.374
Seems to be hiding something to me.
I don't know.

23:41.597 --> 23:45.576
I have a brother like Campbell.
When we were growing up I hated him.

23:45.656 --> 23:49.458
I mean, he was such a prick.
Always beating the hell out of me.

23:49.538 --> 23:52.494
I joined the marines so that
one day I could take him on.

23:52.574 --> 23:55.054
Give him a little payback, you know?

23:55.811 --> 23:58.534
Because I think
there are two kinds of brothers.

23:58.614 --> 24:01.194
There are the ones
that back you up in a fight.

24:01.883 --> 24:04.239
And then there are the ones
that throw you to the wolves...

24:04.319 --> 24:07.967
...as they sit back, laugh and point
at you while you're eating shit.

24:09.191 --> 24:11.638
I bet I know which kind Campbell is.

24:27.609 --> 24:29.155
Hey.

24:30.079 --> 24:31.891
Do you have another one of those?

24:35.985 --> 24:37.530
Thanks.

24:46.495 --> 24:48.307
Where's the baby?

24:49.131 --> 24:51.210
Your mom's watching her for me.

24:51.567 --> 24:55.497
Guess you're okay with her
doing that with a drink in her hand.

24:55.577 --> 24:57.960
Why won't you lay off of her?

24:58.040 --> 25:02.027
She just watched her son
turn into a complete lunatic.

25:02.107 --> 25:03.690
Yeah.

25:04.546 --> 25:06.142
Yeah.

25:06.948 --> 25:11.241
He went and got himself
completely fucked up in the head.

25:12.321 --> 25:16.254
Yeah, Mom and Dad are insane if they
think G.I. Joe's gonna pull him out of it.

25:16.334 --> 25:18.151
'Cause that guy is a fucking asshole.

25:18.231 --> 25:21.704
We have to try. Okay, Zoey needs her father.

25:21.784 --> 25:25.655
Face it, Sam. Justin is never
going to be dad material...

25:25.735 --> 25:29.820
- ...even if this bullshit actually works.
- You have no idea how hard it is.

25:29.900 --> 25:32.225
I had to drop out of school to have Zoey.

25:34.076 --> 25:35.788
We all want him back.

25:41.183 --> 25:43.919
He used to love coming
to this place when we were kids.

25:44.119 --> 25:48.935
As soon as we got here every summer,
he'd go off into the woods on his own.

25:49.691 --> 25:51.780
And we'd think he was lost.

25:51.860 --> 25:53.915
Mom would panic.

25:53.995 --> 25:56.541
But then we would find him
under a tree somewhere...

25:56.621 --> 26:01.680
...playing weirdo games with pine cones
and animals bones and shit.

26:03.105 --> 26:04.951
Yeah, that sounds like Justin.

26:05.724 --> 26:08.988
There was an owl that lived in this tree.

26:11.196 --> 26:13.750
I would tell Justin that it was
the devil watching him...

26:13.830 --> 26:17.664
...that if he didn't do everything
I told him it would kill him in his sleep.

26:19.588 --> 26:21.777
I thought it would scare
the shit out of him...

26:21.857 --> 26:25.664
...but he got a sleeping bag and he
spent the whole night right here.

26:26.144 --> 26:28.040
Just to prove me wrong.

26:30.525 --> 26:33.099
You know they're into that kind of stuff too.

26:33.902 --> 26:36.603
Who is? His family?

26:37.219 --> 26:41.020
Deep dark forest. Creatures of the night.

26:42.010 --> 26:45.154
Come on. Let's head back.

26:48.183 --> 26:50.405
We really let him down, didn't we?

26:51.285 --> 26:53.032
Speak for yourself.

26:53.288 --> 26:56.335
There's only person responsible for Justin.

27:13.775 --> 27:15.587
Here you go.

27:18.417 --> 27:22.637
Your leader must be an amazing guy
to have you so devoted to him.

27:22.717 --> 27:25.811
I mean, he says jump. You say how high?

27:25.891 --> 27:28.210
He told you about the cataclysm, right?

27:28.290 --> 27:30.503
The revolution he's got planned.

27:31.092 --> 27:33.511
The war where he comes out on top...

27:33.591 --> 27:37.610
...and kills everyone else
that's unworthy of being in his club.

27:41.350 --> 27:43.926
"The unworthy will know
unimaginable suffering...

27:44.006 --> 27:46.762
...and there will be a blood bath
that will cleanse the Earth."

27:46.842 --> 27:49.216
You read this I assume.

27:49.296 --> 27:52.992
Of course, you have.
Your boss wrote it, right?

27:59.137 --> 28:01.400
What makes you one of the worthy?

28:02.724 --> 28:04.478
Has it ever occurred to you...

28:04.558 --> 28:08.007
...that you may be part of that family
because they're using you?

28:09.631 --> 28:12.645
I mean, revolutions ain't cheap, buddy.

28:14.803 --> 28:18.284
They know you're a rich kid.
They know your dad's well connected.

28:18.840 --> 28:21.653
When do you think
they're gonna cash in on that?

28:25.247 --> 28:28.094
Look, I know they made you feel special.

28:28.433 --> 28:30.246
Accepted you...

28:31.686 --> 28:33.566
...but you're a smart kid.

28:38.860 --> 28:43.047
I can tell you're smart. Why can't
you see you're just a tool to them?

28:43.127 --> 28:47.413
They prey on the weak, that's their gig!
Hey, I'm talking to you...

28:47.902 --> 28:49.198
Fuck!

28:52.240 --> 28:55.084
What did you do? Bite your fucking tongue?

28:55.767 --> 28:57.289
Alright.

28:57.746 --> 29:00.702
Here. We wouldn't want it
to get infected now, would we?

29:00.782 --> 29:04.005
Open up your goddamn mouth! How about that?

29:04.894 --> 29:08.277
There you go. Now they'll know
that at least they gave you...

29:08.357 --> 29:11.803
...a little first aid treatment
when you got injured, see?

29:17.416 --> 29:19.187
Come here.

29:19.267 --> 29:21.866
Let me clean you up. There you go.

29:22.271 --> 29:24.750
Yeah. There you go.

29:44.092 --> 29:47.786
- How could I ever let this happen?
- It's not your fault, Kath.

29:47.866 --> 29:50.333
You always told me I babied him too much.

29:50.823 --> 29:54.046
No, I was... I was too hard on him.

29:55.016 --> 29:57.563
Justin's always been the sensitive one.

30:00.442 --> 30:04.843
I shouldn't have got so upset with him
when I found out that he got her pregnant.

30:06.047 --> 30:09.095
I should've just told him
to use rubbers years before.

30:11.152 --> 30:13.599
Yeah, as if it would've mattered.

30:15.907 --> 30:18.587
I saw the pain attached to his life.

30:20.729 --> 30:23.151
He never recovered from the divorce.

30:23.231 --> 30:25.787
Yeah, I should've handled that better too.

30:25.867 --> 30:28.623
I'm the one that drove him
straight into their arms.

30:28.703 --> 30:32.207
Andrew, I blame you for a lot of things.

30:32.287 --> 30:34.353
I don't blame you for this.

30:50.992 --> 30:53.005
You're up, Samantha.

30:53.395 --> 30:57.007
- Leave the baby, just you.
- How's he doing?

30:57.087 --> 31:00.946
Look, there's a system to this.
We'll get through to him.

31:02.971 --> 31:05.977
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm just nervous.

31:06.057 --> 31:08.330
There's nothing to be nervous about, alright?

31:08.410 --> 31:12.233
You're gonna go up there, you're gonna
talk to him about the things we discussed.

31:12.313 --> 31:16.576
Don't get too close to him. There's some
blood on his shirt, but it's nothing.

31:16.918 --> 31:21.534
- Okay, did he say anything or...
- No, so don't expect it.

31:21.990 --> 31:24.012
- Okay.
- Just be strong.

31:24.092 --> 31:26.314
Stick to what we talked about, alright.

31:26.394 --> 31:27.940
Okay.

32:22.150 --> 32:23.996
Hey, Justin.

32:26.521 --> 32:29.948
I wanted to apologize...

32:30.028 --> 32:32.887
...for the last time I saw you.

32:33.294 --> 32:37.876
I told you Zoey would be
better off without you, but...

32:38.700 --> 32:43.726
...I didn't mean that.
I was just upset and I'm sorry.

32:48.326 --> 32:52.000
Your parents have been really great to us.

32:52.080 --> 32:57.163
Me and Zoey, I don't... I don't know
what I would have done without them.

32:58.253 --> 33:02.477
And I know that they freaked out at first...

33:02.557 --> 33:04.091
...but...

33:04.596 --> 33:06.727
...they love her so much.

33:09.364 --> 33:12.621
You know, we're...
we're living with your mom now.

33:12.701 --> 33:17.533
She has plenty of room and a nice house.

33:18.239 --> 33:21.207
We really want you to live with us too.

33:24.145 --> 33:26.392
Zoey has your eyes.

33:27.849 --> 33:30.305
He's lashing out due to feelings of guilt.

33:30.385 --> 33:34.725
Even fear of what the cult itself
might be thinking about him right now.

33:34.805 --> 33:39.080
It's a normal reaction.
He's torn between two father figures.

33:39.160 --> 33:42.385
Come on. This is all just a waste of time.

33:42.465 --> 33:44.886
So helping your brother
is just a waste of time?

33:44.966 --> 33:47.243
You're gonna psychoanalyze me
now Mr. Tough Love?

33:47.323 --> 33:51.292
- Cam, that's enough out of you.
- I'm already fighting with your brother.

33:51.372 --> 33:54.987
I'm not gonna fight with you too.
I need your help.

33:55.109 --> 33:57.796
- Okay.
- Someone's out there.

33:57.876 --> 33:59.391
What?

34:00.515 --> 34:02.094
Where?

34:04.252 --> 34:06.332
Where the swing's at.

34:13.194 --> 34:15.868
Goddammit, Justin.

34:16.364 --> 34:18.811
Why won't you talk to me?

34:19.167 --> 34:22.657
Stop this, it's me. It's Sam.

34:22.737 --> 34:25.630
You have to know that I still love you.

34:25.940 --> 34:30.216
Okay, all I care about is our future.

34:30.879 --> 34:35.261
- Together. You, me and Zoey.
- Where's the baby?

34:36.251 --> 34:37.795
What?

34:38.186 --> 34:40.600
Zoey's... Zoey's downstairs sleeping.

34:42.322 --> 34:44.202
Not for long.

34:45.760 --> 34:46.899
What?

35:08.850 --> 35:10.429
Hey!

35:11.419 --> 35:13.665
Why would you say that?

35:14.305 --> 35:16.185
That's your baby.

35:16.558 --> 35:19.257
Your little girl. Don't you care?

35:19.337 --> 35:21.206
Of course, I care.

35:22.397 --> 35:24.994
My brothers and sisters...

35:25.074 --> 35:27.713
...we need all the babies we can get.

35:28.953 --> 35:31.617
They are the future after all.

35:34.893 --> 35:38.340
You're on private property.
It's time to move on.

35:44.752 --> 35:46.598
Did you hear what I said?

35:48.089 --> 35:49.548
Hey!

36:04.906 --> 36:06.418
Fuck.

36:20.054 --> 36:23.612
What? Justin, why are you acting like this?

36:23.692 --> 36:25.591
You're scaring me.

36:35.436 --> 36:37.482
The hell are you doing?

37:25.280 --> 37:26.985
What just happened?

37:27.388 --> 37:28.967
Dad?

37:39.067 --> 37:42.123
Kathy, I need you to call the police.

37:42.203 --> 37:44.360
Tell them to get up here as fast as they can.

37:44.440 --> 37:46.950
- You're not going out there.
- I'm going with you.

37:47.030 --> 37:48.563
Campbell, no.

37:48.643 --> 37:51.456
- What was that?
- The cars.

37:54.582 --> 37:57.783
Let's go. You lock this door behind me.

38:02.023 --> 38:03.515
Okay.

38:03.858 --> 38:05.134
Okay.

38:05.827 --> 38:07.373
Jimmy.

38:09.964 --> 38:11.510
Jimmy!

38:38.760 --> 38:40.169
What do you want?

38:49.504 --> 38:52.317
Now, let's go. Go. Go!

38:55.209 --> 38:58.093
- Mom, open the door!
- Shit.

39:04.635 --> 39:06.775
- Where's Jimmy?
- There are people out there.

39:06.855 --> 39:08.767
What people?

39:09.457 --> 39:13.199
- Oh, my God.
- They've come for me.

39:14.896 --> 39:18.544
My brothers and sisters, they've come for me.

39:22.336 --> 39:24.192
Did you get through to the police?

39:24.272 --> 39:27.119
The phone's dead. Someone cut the line.

39:29.083 --> 39:31.399
Andrew, who the hell is out there?

39:31.479 --> 39:33.142
Justin's cult.

39:35.450 --> 39:37.929
He said they've come to take him back.

39:38.619 --> 39:40.675
Oh, God.

39:40.755 --> 39:44.015
Right, Kathy. You make sure
the kitchen windows are locked, alright.

39:44.095 --> 39:46.014
- Campbell, get my tool box.
- Okay.

39:46.094 --> 39:48.488
Samantha, there's some
kerosene lanterns in the hallway.

39:48.568 --> 39:50.075
Okay.

39:58.539 --> 40:02.036
We need to gather everything that we can
that can be used as a weapon.

40:02.116 --> 40:04.732
Well, how many of them are there out there?

40:04.812 --> 40:06.802
- I don't know.
- Are there three of them?

40:06.882 --> 40:08.404
- Are there 30 of them?
- I don't know.

40:08.484 --> 40:11.039
- Can we try talking to them?
- We tried that, Mom.

40:11.119 --> 40:14.642
Okay, these are crazy people.
You've heard about what they do.

40:14.722 --> 40:17.412
- They already got Jimmy.
- What?

40:17.492 --> 40:19.771
What do you mean? What happened?

40:22.897 --> 40:24.742
We don't know.

40:25.533 --> 40:26.889
Oh, my God.

40:39.980 --> 40:41.526
Here.

41:01.269 --> 41:02.848
Knives.

41:31.999 --> 41:34.279
How far is the closest neighbor?

41:34.602 --> 41:36.215
At least a mile away.

41:46.947 --> 41:48.784
I need to change her diaper.

41:51.075 --> 41:53.899
- Okay. I'll go with you.
- Okay.

41:53.979 --> 41:56.732
- I'm gonna go check on Justin.
- Yeah.

42:15.393 --> 42:17.038
Hey, son.

42:17.845 --> 42:19.691
You okay?

42:20.281 --> 42:22.761
Just wanted to bring you some light.

42:33.027 --> 42:36.484
Remember when I brought that lava lamp
in here for you and your brother?

42:37.264 --> 42:40.312
I thought that maybe
you might be scared of the dark.

42:40.801 --> 42:44.759
Turned out that your brother
was scared of the lava lamp.

42:55.216 --> 42:58.519
- Anything?
- No, nothing.

42:58.599 --> 43:02.543
I think if these assholes were serious,
they would've done something by now.

43:02.623 --> 43:05.448
Well, they did something
to Jimmy, right? Do you think...

43:29.984 --> 43:31.830
It's Jimmy's tattoo.

43:33.421 --> 43:35.033
What? No.

43:35.113 --> 43:39.369
- It's okay. It's okay.
- It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

43:45.739 --> 43:47.513
That's alright.

43:48.182 --> 43:50.019
That's alright.

44:18.833 --> 44:21.619
- Stay here. Campbell!
- What?

44:27.375 --> 44:30.269
- It's Jimmy.
- No, Dad. Wait, wait.

44:30.349 --> 44:32.157
It's Jimmy.

45:24.332 --> 45:26.211
The door.

45:44.618 --> 45:46.664
Let's get him to the bedroom.

45:57.231 --> 45:58.674
Give me a towel.

46:01.101 --> 46:03.023
Go check on the girls,
make sure they're safe.

46:03.103 --> 46:05.116
And make sure the doors are locked.

46:12.113 --> 46:15.193
- Fuck!
- Jimmy, what happened?

46:15.916 --> 46:18.063
I underestimated them.

46:18.342 --> 46:20.193
I gotta get you to a hospital, Jimmy.

46:20.273 --> 46:22.133
There's no time.

46:22.623 --> 46:24.577
There's too many of them.

46:24.657 --> 46:26.530
They're fucking everywhere.

46:28.629 --> 46:31.843
- How many came in?
- Just one.

46:32.917 --> 46:34.779
They're toying with you.

46:38.305 --> 46:42.477
They want him to redeem himself.
Justin on his own.

46:43.377 --> 46:45.256
They're not gonna stop.

46:46.881 --> 46:50.128
- Fuck.
- Jimmy, Jimmy.

47:03.874 --> 47:05.376
Fuck!

47:23.767 --> 47:26.798
How did Justin get involved
with these people?

47:27.087 --> 47:28.900
He's never been violent.

47:29.957 --> 47:31.836
He's a young man.

47:32.593 --> 47:34.973
Young men need to find their tribe.

47:35.429 --> 47:37.918
He needs something to believe in.

47:37.998 --> 47:40.065
Well, then we failed him as parents.

47:43.270 --> 47:45.435
What are they doing out there?

47:45.515 --> 47:46.637
Nothing.

47:48.024 --> 47:50.564
- Can you still see them?
- No.

47:50.644 --> 47:52.490
Maybe they've gone.

47:53.948 --> 47:55.793
What are we gonna do?

47:56.717 --> 47:58.796
I haven't figured that out yet.

47:59.520 --> 48:01.509
What about the cars?

48:01.589 --> 48:03.868
I don't think that's gonna work.

48:04.858 --> 48:07.072
How'd these assholes even find us here?

48:08.128 --> 48:12.177
While we grabbed Justin,
there was another kid with him.

48:13.167 --> 48:15.180
He must've known about the cabin.

48:19.206 --> 48:22.930
What if one of us...
by one of us, I mean me...

48:23.010 --> 48:25.025
...makes a run out of the backdoor
to try and get help.

48:25.105 --> 48:27.162
Campbell, no.

48:27.242 --> 48:30.939
But I'm fast. And I'll body check
any lunatic who tries to slow me down.

48:31.019 --> 48:33.071
No, I can't risk you getting caught.

48:33.151 --> 48:36.235
What if we cause some sort
of distraction? A diversion.

48:36.315 --> 48:38.443
- Yeah.
- We could get all of their attention...

48:38.523 --> 48:40.774
...to the front of the cabin
and send Cam out the back.

48:40.854 --> 48:42.355
- Yes.
- No!

48:42.435 --> 48:44.322
Do you have any other ideas at all?

48:44.402 --> 48:47.651
I know your usual solution to problems
is just throw money at them...

48:47.731 --> 48:49.491
...but the guy you paid this time is dead.

48:49.571 --> 48:53.525
We're not gonna risk them
catching you. No, Campbell.

48:55.843 --> 48:58.656
Why don't they just get it over with?

48:59.680 --> 49:03.528
Why haven't they just smashed
the windows and killed us?

49:03.817 --> 49:06.031
It's a show of force for them.

49:06.767 --> 49:08.866
They want us to submit.

49:10.824 --> 49:14.906
Well, then what about this?
Why don't we just give him to them?

49:15.963 --> 49:18.956
- What?
- They already killed one person.

49:19.036 --> 49:21.860
They just tried to kill you and me.
If all they want is Justin...

49:21.940 --> 49:23.785
...why don't we just hand
the little shit over to them?

49:23.865 --> 49:26.851
- That's your brother you're talking about.
- It's what they want!

49:26.934 --> 49:30.733
- It's what he wants.
- How can you even think like that?

49:30.823 --> 49:34.802
- Come on. We're all thinking it.
- We are not giving your brother over.

49:34.882 --> 49:37.756
We can not give him back to them, Cam. No.

49:37.836 --> 49:40.459
We need to stick together as a family.

49:40.821 --> 49:42.670
A family?

49:42.750 --> 49:44.796
What family?

49:44.892 --> 49:47.055
You and Mom split up.

49:47.135 --> 49:48.720
Campbell...

49:49.530 --> 49:54.011
...it's my fault your mother left.
I was cheating on her.

49:54.334 --> 49:57.826
All those late nights. Business meetings.

49:57.906 --> 50:01.315
Okay, guys.
This really is not the time for this.

50:01.395 --> 50:02.988
Yeah.

50:05.446 --> 50:09.260
I felt sorry for you. Defended you.

50:12.152 --> 50:14.413
Dammit, I was on your side!

50:15.307 --> 50:17.455
I was on your side!

50:17.858 --> 50:19.454
I get it, Dad.

50:19.534 --> 50:22.884
It's that guilty conscience of yours
that you're so disappointed...

50:22.964 --> 50:24.818
...didn't get passed on to your sons.

50:24.898 --> 50:28.216
You really thought hiring Jimmy,
getting Justin back...

50:28.296 --> 50:30.302
...bringing all of us here to the cabin...

50:30.382 --> 50:33.297
...you actually thought that would put
things back together, didn't you?

50:33.377 --> 50:35.912
Saving Justin redeems you.

50:35.992 --> 50:39.132
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but our best bet right now...

50:39.212 --> 50:43.905
...is to go upstairs, untie him and let him
march out that fucking front door...

50:43.985 --> 50:46.464
...to rejoin the psycho brigade.

50:46.544 --> 50:49.834
And who's to say they wouldn't burn
the cabin down with us in it...

50:49.914 --> 50:51.769
...after we give him back?

51:08.976 --> 51:11.422
Campbell, no, wait.

51:25.092 --> 51:26.738
They're everywhere.

51:36.537 --> 51:39.583
- He's back.
- What?

51:57.910 --> 52:00.338
He wants us to turn Justin over.

52:02.996 --> 52:07.107
So this is it! We hand him over.
Come on, this is our chance.

52:07.187 --> 52:08.656
Campbell, no.

52:08.736 --> 52:10.859
- Get out of my way.
- No.

52:10.939 --> 52:13.554
These people are fucking wackos, Sam.

52:13.634 --> 52:16.010
What do you think happens
when they get their hands on Zoey?

52:16.090 --> 52:20.291
Is it really worth what they'll do to her
if we don't hand him over now? Move!

52:20.371 --> 52:22.470
- No.
- Samantha, I swear to God...

52:22.550 --> 52:24.894
...if you don't get out of my way
I will knock you on your ass.

52:24.974 --> 52:30.200
Goddammit, what is this? What are you
doing, what are you talking about this for?

52:41.903 --> 52:43.693
Oh, my God. What is that?

52:43.773 --> 52:45.930
- Everything's locked, right?
- Yeah.

52:46.010 --> 52:49.229
Okay, we gotta go upstairs
and get your brother.

52:49.310 --> 52:52.156
- Okay.
- I have to get Zoey.

54:19.937 --> 54:21.661
That's him.

54:21.951 --> 54:25.653
- Who?
- The kid who was with Justin.

54:26.406 --> 54:28.595
You killed my brother.

54:28.675 --> 54:33.290
Your brother?
I'm your brother, you little shit!

54:35.649 --> 54:37.662
You're a monster.

54:37.985 --> 54:39.697
Let's get him downstairs.

54:59.606 --> 55:02.429
I want to do something that
we haven't done for a long time.

55:02.509 --> 55:05.189
Just have a conversation. Okay.

55:13.113 --> 55:14.818
- You're dead.
- Shut up.

55:15.088 --> 55:20.751
He's gonna save me and deliver me
to my brothers and sisters.

55:20.961 --> 55:24.996
You and that tough guy, Jimmy.
Where is he, by the way?

55:25.899 --> 55:28.822
He's dead. They killed him.

55:28.902 --> 55:32.091
I knew it. How did they kill him?

55:32.171 --> 55:35.019
Was it something spectacular?

55:40.514 --> 55:42.326
I bet it was.

55:43.350 --> 55:47.074
- Justin...
- My name... is Thanatos!

55:47.154 --> 55:48.942
Okay?

55:49.522 --> 55:53.971
Is there something we can tell
those people outside...

55:54.094 --> 55:56.106
...to make them stop?

55:57.664 --> 56:00.574
Let... me... go!

56:00.654 --> 56:03.667
- No.
- I won't do that.

56:03.747 --> 56:07.160
Well, then we'll just sit here
and prolong the inevitable.

56:07.240 --> 56:09.754
They'll come in here soon and when they do...

56:11.278 --> 56:13.154
...they'll rape these two.

56:14.448 --> 56:18.225
Make you watch before
they cut your fucking heads off.

56:19.052 --> 56:21.808
- Campbell, no!
- Campbell, that's enough!

56:21.888 --> 56:25.283
Maybe you forgot all the times I kicked
your ass over the years, little man?

56:25.363 --> 56:29.745
It all just came back to me.
I'm gonna savor watching you suffer.

56:30.215 --> 56:33.251
- They'll skin you alive.
- Yeah, I'd like to see that...

56:33.331 --> 56:35.714
- Back off!
- I'll like to see them try!

56:35.794 --> 56:37.343
That's enough!

56:37.813 --> 56:39.660
Back off!

56:39.910 --> 56:42.628
- You hear the shit he's saying?
- He doesn't know what's he's talking about.

56:42.708 --> 56:46.633
Jesus Christ, Dad! He's fucking faking it!
He's playing us.

56:46.713 --> 56:49.536
Justin, can't you see
what we're trying to do for you?

56:49.616 --> 56:53.831
We are all here for you and we love you.
Do you understand that?

56:54.754 --> 56:57.635
We just want our Justin back. That's all.

57:05.315 --> 57:07.995
Stop this. Look at me.

57:09.035 --> 57:10.915
Look at me.

57:12.405 --> 57:14.218
Whatever you've done.

57:15.041 --> 57:17.064
We love you.

57:17.144 --> 57:19.356
We just want you to come back.

57:20.030 --> 57:21.919
You're my baby.

57:22.549 --> 57:24.386
You are my baby.

57:24.466 --> 57:28.090
Remember all the wonderful times we had here.

57:29.022 --> 57:32.002
All the promises we made to each other.

57:34.594 --> 57:36.440
You remember?

57:55.682 --> 57:57.901
Goddamn you. Goddamn you.

57:57.981 --> 57:59.770
Fuck God.

58:00.120 --> 58:03.968
You gotta get it together!
You gotta get it together! Alright?

58:06.776 --> 58:09.523
I can count on you, right? Right?

58:11.264 --> 58:13.344
You really think
you can make it to that cabin?

58:13.466 --> 58:16.691
Yeah, yeah. I mean,
it's only a mile and a half?

58:16.771 --> 58:19.203
I know this forest, I can do it.

58:19.283 --> 58:21.495
What are you going to do to distract him?

58:21.775 --> 58:23.854
I'm gonna give them what they want.

58:44.264 --> 58:46.110
Here he is!

58:46.666 --> 58:48.746
Here's your Thanatos!

58:51.104 --> 58:52.983
Come out.

58:54.207 --> 58:57.461
Come out! I know you're out there.

58:58.345 --> 59:01.293
- Come out and get him.
- Oh, God!

59:01.632 --> 59:04.862
You want him, you got him.

59:39.786 --> 59:41.608
You win.

59:41.688 --> 59:43.818
Do you think that's all of them?

59:44.057 --> 59:45.903
I hope so.

59:47.994 --> 59:49.507
Okay.

01:00:00.574 --> 01:00:02.081
I think they're all up front.

01:00:02.161 --> 01:00:04.932
The second I'm out the door,
you close it and lock it. You got it?

01:00:05.012 --> 01:00:07.588
- Yeah.
- Don't stop and look, just close it tight.

01:00:07.668 --> 01:00:09.926
If you want him back...

01:00:10.006 --> 01:00:12.907
...I need to save the rest
of my family. You hear me?

01:00:12.987 --> 01:00:15.076
I'll get to the Russell's cabin
and call for help.

01:00:15.156 --> 01:00:18.190
- Cops will be here in no time, okay?
- Please just be careful.

01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:22.559
Don't be scared, Sam. We're all
gonna make it out of this, I promise.

01:00:22.639 --> 01:00:25.075
You need to get the hell out of here.

01:00:25.198 --> 01:00:29.054
All of you, go!
I'll give him back if all of you go!

01:00:29.134 --> 01:00:30.490
Oh, baby.

01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:32.416
Do we have a deal?

01:00:34.107 --> 01:00:35.853
Do we have a deal?

01:00:39.246 --> 01:00:42.893
One, two, three.

01:00:51.408 --> 01:00:54.471
Oh, my God! Get off me!

01:00:58.598 --> 01:01:00.001
Let me go!

01:01:05.338 --> 01:01:08.082
- Get off me!
- Oh, shit.

01:01:11.278 --> 01:01:13.123
Let me go!

01:01:14.447 --> 01:01:17.313
Get off! Get off!

01:01:17.617 --> 01:01:19.173
Get out of here.

01:01:23.356 --> 01:01:24.944
Kathy!

01:01:25.434 --> 01:01:27.745
Get out! Goddammit!

01:01:29.393 --> 01:01:31.206
Oh, my God!

01:01:31.531 --> 01:01:34.120
- It's okay.
- Kathy!

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:36.680
Kathy, open up!

01:01:37.687 --> 01:01:39.166
Kathy.

01:01:46.413 --> 01:01:50.694
Stay back! Get out! Get out!

01:02:03.296 --> 01:02:06.177
It's okay, Zoey. It's okay.

01:03:19.939 --> 01:03:21.819
What the fuck?

01:06:26.059 --> 01:06:27.904
They're moving away.

01:06:41.124 --> 01:06:43.620
- What?
- Campbell?

01:06:53.152 --> 01:06:54.899
Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:06:57.957 --> 01:07:00.446
- I gotta go help him.
- No.

01:07:00.526 --> 01:07:03.407
Andrew, that's my son out there.

01:07:20.413 --> 01:07:24.303
- Dad!
- No! That's my son out there!

01:07:24.383 --> 01:07:25.836
That's our son!

01:07:35.862 --> 01:07:38.622
Stop, please.

01:07:44.954 --> 01:07:46.567
Dad!

01:07:53.596 --> 01:07:56.130
Dad, they only want Justin!

01:07:58.584 --> 01:08:01.064
Please just give him to them!

01:08:11.097 --> 01:08:16.560
They'll let us live if we just
give him to them. Please, Dad!

01:08:17.435 --> 01:08:20.082
- No.
- We need to give them Justin.

01:08:20.173 --> 01:08:25.415
No, they told him to say that. If we
give him to them, then we're all dead.

01:08:25.645 --> 01:08:29.171
- Samantha, get out of my way.
- No, stay away from him!

01:08:29.252 --> 01:08:33.013
No, Mr. Powell. You're gonna
have to find another way.

01:08:33.685 --> 01:08:37.533
If we give Justin back to them
then we're all dead!

01:08:38.157 --> 01:08:41.805
Your wife and your granddaughter.

01:08:48.868 --> 01:08:50.380
Dad!

01:08:51.237 --> 01:08:53.493
Please help me!

01:08:53.573 --> 01:08:56.479
No! Oh, God, no!

01:09:05.886 --> 01:09:07.731
What is that?

01:09:07.819 --> 01:09:09.341
Give it to me.

01:09:09.421 --> 01:09:11.702
- No.
- Give it to me.

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:15.629
Please.

01:09:24.737 --> 01:09:26.170
Oh, God!

01:09:27.273 --> 01:09:28.779
No!

01:09:41.737 --> 01:09:44.818
Justin, you have to do something. Help him.

01:09:47.026 --> 01:09:49.038
That is your brother!

01:09:56.168 --> 01:10:00.216
No. Please don't! Stop!

01:10:00.306 --> 01:10:01.399
No!

01:10:10.617 --> 01:10:13.551
Stop! Please, no!

01:10:13.631 --> 01:10:15.842
Please! Please!

01:10:15.922 --> 01:10:17.982
Stop it! No!

01:10:19.258 --> 01:10:21.182
Stop it!

01:10:22.395 --> 01:10:24.174
Please! Please!

01:10:25.364 --> 01:10:26.930
Baby...

01:10:46.569 --> 01:10:50.003
No! No!

01:11:00.533 --> 01:11:03.157
Mrs. Powell, no. No! No, no, no, no!

01:11:03.237 --> 01:11:05.758
Mrs. Powell, you can't go out there!

01:11:05.838 --> 01:11:07.394
No!

01:11:46.212 --> 01:11:47.758
Campbell.

01:11:52.718 --> 01:11:55.942
Look at me. I'm here.

01:11:56.022 --> 01:11:57.576
I'm here.

01:11:57.656 --> 01:11:59.536
Don't be afraid.

01:12:00.559 --> 01:12:02.772
I'll always be with you.

01:12:03.029 --> 01:12:04.574
Okay.

01:12:49.942 --> 01:12:51.868
Where's Kathy?

01:12:52.845 --> 01:12:56.059
I tried to stop her. I tried.

01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:16.475
No!

01:13:17.124 --> 01:13:19.557
Mr. Powell, please don't go.

01:13:19.638 --> 01:13:21.484
I have to.

01:13:22.375 --> 01:13:24.388
You lock that door behind me.

01:13:26.712 --> 01:13:29.192
Campbell, I'm coming!

01:13:29.348 --> 01:13:30.894
I'm coming!

01:13:31.684 --> 01:13:33.563
I'm coming!

01:13:42.494 --> 01:13:44.040
Samantha.

01:13:48.734 --> 01:13:50.280
Sam.

01:13:55.441 --> 01:13:58.106
Please take this collar off me.

01:13:58.186 --> 01:14:00.600
I have to go out there and stop this.

01:14:01.647 --> 01:14:03.480
How can I trust you?

01:14:04.383 --> 01:14:07.797
It's me. Sam, it's Justin.

01:14:08.961 --> 01:14:11.360
Let me go before they kill my parents.

01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:12.666
No.

01:14:20.466 --> 01:14:24.047
What happens to me and Zoey
if I cut you loose?

01:14:26.672 --> 01:14:29.656
Once I'm outside, I want you to take Zoey...

01:14:29.736 --> 01:14:32.598
...go out the back door
and you run like hell.

01:14:32.678 --> 01:14:36.034
There's another cabin about
a mile and a half north of here.

01:14:36.114 --> 01:14:37.737
You don't stop till you get there, okay?

01:14:37.817 --> 01:14:39.813
I thought you were just going
to go talk to them.

01:14:39.893 --> 01:14:43.467
Please just do it before it's too late.

01:14:45.557 --> 01:14:46.703
Okay.

01:15:15.087 --> 01:15:16.633
Justin?

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:22.972
Justin, no.

01:16:09.575 --> 01:16:11.421
Thank you.

01:16:42.608 --> 01:16:43.854
Campbell.

01:16:52.551 --> 01:16:54.447
I'm the father.

01:16:58.290 --> 01:17:00.136
I'm the father.

01:18:49.034 --> 01:18:53.249
It's okay, Zoey.
We're gonna make it, I promise.

01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:24.313
Please. Here.
