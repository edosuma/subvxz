Hey, guys, thanks.

00:37.500 --> 00:39.415
Support your team?
Thank you.

00:39.541 --> 00:41.249
Hey, guys,
did you get one of these?

00:41.375 --> 00:43.665
- Hope you can make it.
- What's this?

00:43.791 --> 00:45.624
The girls' volleyball team
has a big game tonight,

00:45.750 --> 00:47.707
and we're just asking for people
to come cheer us on.

00:47.833 --> 00:49.249
Girls' volleyball?

00:51.666 --> 00:53.249
Uh, sorry.
We're actually busy.

00:53.375 --> 00:55.749
What's wrong with
supporting girls' athletics?

00:55.875 --> 00:57.707
Dude, girls should totally
be allowed to play sports.

00:57.833 --> 00:59.415
You just can't expect people
to want to watch.

00:59.541 --> 01:00.957
Okay?
All right.

01:01.083 --> 01:02.749
You know,
we're actually in the playoffs,

01:02.875 --> 01:05.040
and all we keep hearing is,
"We're too busy."

01:05.166 --> 01:07.957
But we actually are busy.
Tonight's the big fight.

01:08.083 --> 01:08.957
What fight?

01:09.083 --> 01:11.707
Dude, Kenny is fighting
Slaughterhouse tonight.

01:11.833 --> 01:12.707
I mean, no offense,

01:12.833 --> 01:15.415
but we're not gonna miss the
fight for girls' volleyball.

01:17.333 --> 01:19.415
Yeah, so, sorry you're not
getting any spectators,

01:19.541 --> 01:22.290
but there's hard-core
dude shit to watch.

01:31.791 --> 01:34.457
All right, I'm going to play
a fifth mana card.

01:34.583 --> 01:37.290
And then I'm going to attack
with my Elder Beast.

01:37.416 --> 01:40.457
Hold on. Wait. Hold on.

01:42.166 --> 01:44.124
Can Kenny block
his Elder Beast?

01:44.250 --> 01:46.165
Not with his Shapeshifter.
It's already tapped.

01:46.291 --> 01:48.040
This asshole
needs to make a move already.

01:48.166 --> 01:49.915
Quiet in the peanut gallery,
please.

01:50.041 --> 01:51.207
I am attacking,

01:51.333 --> 01:53.874
but with a newly summoned
Spark Ghast who has trample.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.415
Four damage
to your Planeswalker.

01:55.541 --> 01:56.790
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

01:56.916 --> 01:57.915
Oh, no! Kenny!

01:58.041 --> 01:59.790
- Shh!
- But he's dying!

02:03.166 --> 02:04.624
- What's that?
- He's playing an enchantment.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.040
This late?

02:06.166 --> 02:07.624
He's just
stacked his Shapeshifter

02:07.750 --> 02:08.582
with an Elven Blade!

02:08.708 --> 02:10.790
I can block that
with Uprooted Minotaur!

02:12.000 --> 02:13.790
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

02:13.916 --> 02:15.165
Serendib Sorcerer unblocked.

02:15.291 --> 02:16.415
Winner -- McCormick!

02:16.541 --> 02:18.249
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

02:18.375 --> 02:20.207
No!

02:20.333 --> 02:22.415
Dude, it was
complete brutality.

02:22.541 --> 02:24.457
You've never seen anything
so ruthless.

02:24.583 --> 02:25.832
It was seriously
almost hard to watch.

02:25.958 --> 02:28.582
At one point, Kenny actually
polymorphed the dude

02:28.708 --> 02:30.749
into a blue frog
with an instant attack card.

02:30.875 --> 02:32.540
It was carnage, bro.

02:32.666 --> 02:33.999
Wendy, did you hear about
last night?

02:34.125 --> 02:35.540
Yeah, I heard
the girls' volleyball team

02:35.666 --> 02:36.915
won by like 20 points.

02:37.041 --> 02:39.165
Not that.
Did you actually go to that?

02:39.291 --> 02:41.707
Yeah. You should show
your support, too, sometime.

02:41.833 --> 02:42.957
Whatever.

02:43.083 --> 02:44.874
Dude, I don't think people
are appreciating this.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.915
It was such "pwnage,"
it was almost repulsive.

02:48.041 --> 02:51.624
Hey! Psst!
Come over here.

02:51.750 --> 02:54.332
You guys
like hard-core stuff, huh?

02:54.458 --> 02:56.832
Yeah, we like hard-core stuff.
We're fucking dudes, bro.

02:56.958 --> 03:00.124
Yeah, well, you boys want
to get in on some real action?

03:00.250 --> 03:01.957
If you like excitement.

03:02.083 --> 03:04.124
I'm not talking about
that little-boy stuff.

03:04.250 --> 03:05.915
I'm talking real man shit.

03:06.041 --> 03:07.165
We're men.

03:07.291 --> 03:10.624
Well, then, if you want to see
real fights with real brutality,

03:10.750 --> 03:11.832
go here.

03:11.958 --> 03:14.624
This is the underground stuff,
so keep it quiet.

03:14.750 --> 03:17.290
And you might want
to pack a barf bag.

03:17.416 --> 03:19.249
Cool!

03:21.000 --> 03:24.582
Should be the next one --
2778 Mala Vista Drive.

03:24.708 --> 03:26.665
Wait.
This is City Wok.

03:26.791 --> 03:29.999
What's exciting and hard-core
about shitty shrimp?

03:30.125 --> 03:33.624
It doesn't even
look like they're open.

03:34.958 --> 03:36.624
We crose!
We crose for the night!

03:36.750 --> 03:37.790
Go away, prease!

03:37.916 --> 03:39.749
Uh, Mitchell the janitor
sent us.

03:39.875 --> 03:41.165
You porice?

03:41.291 --> 03:43.249
- Rmh?
- Dude, do we look like police?

03:43.375 --> 03:44.290
Okay, come on.
Come on.

03:44.416 --> 03:45.457
Five darra.
Five darra each!

03:45.583 --> 03:46.374
Come on!
Five darra!

03:46.500 --> 03:49.415
Five darra?!

03:51.375 --> 03:53.040
You go down.
Go down, find seat.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.249
We in the sixth fight.

03:54.375 --> 03:55.832
Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

04:12.916 --> 04:14.707
Scrambles plays

04:14.833 --> 04:16.165
a Black Swamp mana card.

04:17.250 --> 04:19.707
Fluffy counters
with a mana card of his own.

04:21.375 --> 04:24.040
And he plays a Fugitive Wizard!

04:24.166 --> 04:25.874
More mana from Scrambles.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.624
And yes,
that is Crippling Blight!

04:27.750 --> 04:29.624
Crippling Blight
to the Fugitive Wizard!

04:29.750 --> 04:32.290
Creature now has minus one
to strength and defense!

04:32.416 --> 04:33.332
More mana from Fluffy.

04:33.458 --> 04:35.082
Now he'll attack
with Fugitive Wizard.

04:35.208 --> 04:37.249
And there's an instant attack
from Scrambles!

04:37.375 --> 04:38.999
That is Peel from Reality!

04:39.125 --> 04:41.040
Fugitive Wizard
is literally torn apart

04:41.166 --> 04:42.207
from the battleground!

04:42.333 --> 04:43.082
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

04:43.208 --> 04:44.499
The mana is flying now,

04:44.625 --> 04:46.040
as both roosters
play sorcery spells!

04:46.166 --> 04:49.499
It's Mass Calcify
against Into the Void!

04:49.625 --> 04:53.290
- Dude, that was total carnage.
- That was freaking hard-core.

04:53.416 --> 04:54.665
Can you believe that rooster

04:54.791 --> 04:56.999
played a Kalonian Twingrove
with half his mana tapped?

04:57.125 --> 04:57.999
It was just decimation.

04:58.125 --> 04:59.499
It was really
about the most man thing

04:59.625 --> 05:00.874
I think
we've ever been a part of.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.207
We're going again
on Friday, right?

05:02.333 --> 05:03.290
Hell yeah!

05:03.416 --> 05:05.040
What's the matter, Kenny?

05:05.166 --> 05:08.040
Mrph rmhmhm.
Rmh rmphm rm.

05:08.166 --> 05:09.749
What's mean about it?

05:09.875 --> 05:12.874
Mrph rmhmhm rm
mrph rmh rmphm.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.374
You feel bad
for the roosters?

05:14.500 --> 05:16.207
Rm.
Mrph rmh rmphm mrph rmhmhm.

05:16.333 --> 05:18.415
Look, who's to say
the roosters don't want to play?

05:18.541 --> 05:19.874
I mean, they were
going at it pretty hard.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.499
Yeah. Maybe that's just
kind of what they do naturally.

05:22.625 --> 05:24.332
Guys, I think
maybe Kenny's a little hurt

05:24.458 --> 05:26.040
because he
was the big Magic champion

05:26.166 --> 05:27.624
and now chickens
are stealing his thunder.

05:27.750 --> 05:28.957
- Rm.
- Huh? A little bit?

05:29.083 --> 05:29.957
Rm!

05:30.083 --> 05:31.207
Dude, you know
what we should do?

05:31.333 --> 05:32.499
We should all go in
on a rooster.

05:32.625 --> 05:33.540
Dude, totally.

05:33.666 --> 05:34.749
With Kenny's Magic skills,

05:34.875 --> 05:36.540
we could probably
kick serious ass!

05:36.666 --> 05:37.624
What do you think, Kenny?

05:37.750 --> 05:39.332
Would that
make you feel better, huh?

05:39.458 --> 05:41.082
Come on.
Where's that smile?

05:41.208 --> 05:43.499
Where's that smile, Kenny?

05:43.625 --> 05:45.707
I think he's smiling,
you guys.

05:48.416 --> 05:50.374
Hello, Mr. McCormick.
Surprised to see us?

05:50.500 --> 05:51.957
What do you mean?

05:52.083 --> 05:53.415
Let's cut the crap, huh?

05:53.541 --> 05:56.165
We know there's an illegal Cock
Magic ring going on in town.

05:56.291 --> 05:58.124
We just want to know
who's leading it.

05:58.250 --> 05:59.499
What's Cock Magic?

05:59.625 --> 06:00.707
Right.

06:00.833 --> 06:02.540
Roosters are being
forced against their will

06:02.666 --> 06:03.832
to play Magic: The Gathering,

06:03.958 --> 06:06.665
and you know nothing about it
because you're white.

06:06.791 --> 06:08.165
Let's get something straight.

06:08.291 --> 06:10.999
Cock Magic isn't an Asian thing
or a Mexican thing.

06:11.125 --> 06:13.707
White people do it, too,
if they're poor enough.

06:13.833 --> 06:15.957
You got a junked car in
your front yard, Mr. McCormick.

06:16.083 --> 06:18.499
Care to tell us where the Cock
Magic fights are being held?

06:18.625 --> 06:21.290
I don't go
to any Cock Magic fights.

06:21.416 --> 06:24.790
Do you have sympathy at all
for the animals, Mr. McCormick?

06:24.916 --> 06:27.207
Can you imagine
being kept in a small cage,

06:27.333 --> 06:30.290
barely able to turn around,
and then finally let out,

06:30.416 --> 06:32.374
only to be blasted
by Arctic ice spells

06:32.500 --> 06:34.290
and legendary creature cards?

06:34.416 --> 06:36.499
It's illegal, and it's wrong.

06:36.625 --> 06:40.415
And anyone I find involved
with this filth is going down!

06:40.541 --> 06:42.290
Now, I don't want to
lecture anybody,

06:42.416 --> 06:44.957
but what you boys are getting
involved in is dangerous.

06:45.083 --> 06:46.582
Dad, it's not that big a deal.

06:46.708 --> 06:49.290
It is a big deal, okay?
People can get hurt.

06:49.416 --> 06:52.624
Believe it or not, I was
into cock magic back in college.

06:52.750 --> 06:53.624
You were?

06:53.750 --> 06:56.249
Yeah, so I'm not some
fuddy-duddy who doesn't get it.

06:56.375 --> 06:57.999
I just want to make sure
if you boys do it,

06:58.125 --> 07:01.124
you do it right and safely.

07:12.916 --> 07:15.915
Dad, that's not --
that's not Cock Magic.

07:16.041 --> 07:19.957
Oh? Not impressed?
How about this?

07:26.375 --> 07:28.124
What is it?

07:28.250 --> 07:29.790
Hello? We're looking
to buy a rooster

07:29.916 --> 07:31.457
that can play
Magic: The Gathering.

07:31.583 --> 07:34.290
Never heard of Cock Magic
or roosters!

07:34.416 --> 07:36.665
Uh, we aren't cops
or anything.

07:37.916 --> 07:40.915
Come on in the back.
Don't mind the smell.

07:41.041 --> 07:44.457
We only deal in the highest
quality poultry Planeswalkers.

07:44.583 --> 07:46.040
Are you looking for
a New Hampshire

07:46.166 --> 07:47.290
or a Cornish breed?

07:47.416 --> 07:49.624
We don't
really know the difference.

07:49.750 --> 07:51.290
Well, your New Hampshire
broiler chickens

07:51.416 --> 07:52.915
are the best for white mana.

07:53.041 --> 07:55.290
These here have been raised
to play mostly protection spells

07:55.416 --> 07:57.040
and do well
with sorcery cards.

07:57.166 --> 07:59.624
And here you got
your green mana necromancers --

07:59.750 --> 08:01.957
lots of earthy growth
and hindering incantations

08:02.083 --> 08:04.957
that are good against
blue- or black-stacked decks.

08:05.083 --> 08:06.915
You think they're happy?

08:07.041 --> 08:09.040
Do I think they're happy?

08:09.166 --> 08:10.207
Yeah, like,
you think they mind

08:10.333 --> 08:11.749
being made to play
Magic: The Gathering?

08:14.041 --> 08:15.957
They're fucking chickens.

08:16.083 --> 08:18.790
Well, our friend here
has some animal-rights concerns.

08:18.916 --> 08:20.624
You have
any free-range chickens?

08:20.750 --> 08:23.624
Free-range chickens are
primarily control-deck players

08:23.750 --> 08:26.749
that slow the game down
with board-control cards.

08:26.875 --> 08:29.040
Oh, screw the free-range
chickens, huh, Kenny?

08:29.166 --> 08:31.082
Hey, how about
this little guy?

08:32.250 --> 08:34.165
That one's kind of young.

08:34.291 --> 08:36.665
I don't even know
what kind of cards he prefers.

08:36.791 --> 08:38.249
Then he's perfect for us.

08:38.375 --> 08:40.124
What should we name him,
Kenny?

08:40.250 --> 08:43.040
I know.
How about McNuggets?

08:43.166 --> 08:45.832
Hey, McNuggets.
You want to come play for us?

08:45.958 --> 08:47.957
"Yes, I do, you guys."

08:48.083 --> 08:51.999
Oh, wow.
Did you hear him, Kenny?

08:52.125 --> 08:55.124
Mom, will you tell Dad
to get out of the bathroom?

08:55.250 --> 08:57.540
He's been in there
for an hour!

09:01.166 --> 09:02.415
Randy?

09:02.541 --> 09:05.290
Hey! Hoo!

09:05.416 --> 09:08.040
Ooh, thank you!

09:08.166 --> 09:09.374
Randy, what are you doing?!

09:09.500 --> 09:11.374
Oh!
Nothing, Sharon!

09:11.500 --> 09:14.207
Just going to the bathroom,
if you don't mind.

09:14.333 --> 09:15.457
Hey!

09:15.583 --> 09:17.499
Randy, why are there
drums playing?

09:20.083 --> 09:21.540
All right, Sharon.

09:21.666 --> 09:22.749
I'm practicing.

09:22.875 --> 09:25.207
Cock magic
is making a comeback.

09:25.333 --> 09:26.540
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

09:26.666 --> 09:28.082
Oh, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes.

09:28.208 --> 09:29.999
Sharon,
I don't know why or how,

09:30.125 --> 09:32.915
but people all over town
are talking about it again.

09:33.041 --> 09:36.040
Now, you know that I was
one of the best back in college.

09:36.166 --> 09:38.790
I know that's why
you got kicked out of college.

09:38.916 --> 09:40.665
Because people
didn't understand.

09:40.791 --> 09:42.249
People were afraid, Sharon.

09:42.375 --> 09:43.999
But now culture has caught up,

09:44.125 --> 09:47.082
and even our son is discovering
what cock magic has to offer.

09:47.208 --> 09:48.415
Stanley?

09:48.541 --> 09:49.999
People are going to do it,
Sharon,

09:50.125 --> 09:51.582
and it's up
to the professionals

09:51.708 --> 09:53.415
to make sure
it's handled the right way.

09:53.541 --> 09:54.582
Oh!

09:54.708 --> 09:56.957
Oh, my gosh!

10:04.083 --> 10:06.457
Reuben casts Silklash Spider.

10:06.583 --> 10:09.790
Silklash Spider can block
as if it had flying.

10:14.125 --> 10:19.665
And now he casts Geistflame,
dealing one damage to McNuggets!

10:19.791 --> 10:20.999
Come on, McNuggets!
Fight!

10:21.125 --> 10:22.374
You can do it, McNuggets!

10:22.500 --> 10:24.957
Quiet, please.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.124
Wait!

10:26.250 --> 10:28.624
McNuggets has cast
Punishing Fire,

10:28.750 --> 10:29.915
absorbing the Geistflame

10:30.041 --> 10:32.374
and dealing two damage
to the opponent!

10:32.500 --> 10:34.124
Game, set, and match,
McNuggets!

10:34.250 --> 10:35.124
Whoa!

10:36.458 --> 10:37.332
- All right!
- Yeah!

10:37.458 --> 10:38.499
All right, McNuggets!

10:38.625 --> 10:40.665
Did we pick the right rooster
or what?

10:40.791 --> 10:42.082
That was goddamn manly.

10:42.208 --> 10:43.457
I mean, no offense to Kenny,

10:43.583 --> 10:45.082
but that shit made regular
Magic: The Gathering

10:45.208 --> 10:46.499
look like girls' volleyball.

10:46.625 --> 10:47.832
Excuse me.

10:47.958 --> 10:49.832
That was pretty impressive
down there.

10:49.958 --> 10:52.540
You boys have a nice cock.

10:52.666 --> 10:54.332
Thank you so very much.

10:54.458 --> 10:56.457
I've never seen a rooster
throw down spells

10:56.583 --> 10:57.749
with such raw brutality.

10:57.875 --> 10:59.999
How would you like
to move him up to the big time?

11:00.125 --> 11:01.540
You mean
there's more to this?

11:01.666 --> 11:03.290
Oh, yes,
and I'm not talking about

11:03.416 --> 11:05.374
the basement of
some seedy Chinese restaurant.

11:05.500 --> 11:06.582
I'm talking about the basement

11:06.708 --> 11:09.124
of a well-established
Chinese franchise.

11:09.250 --> 11:11.165
Saturday night.
Here's the address.

11:11.291 --> 11:14.165
Let's see what kind of money
your cock can really make.

11:14.291 --> 11:15.499
Gee, thanks.

11:15.625 --> 11:17.165
You hear that, McNuggets?

11:17.291 --> 11:19.415
You're going
to the big leagues.

11:21.083 --> 11:23.582
Okay, kids, it's time
for our birthday show.

11:23.708 --> 11:25.624
Everyone, let's be quiet now.
Come on.

11:25.750 --> 11:27.665
Yay!
A show, a show!

11:27.791 --> 11:29.124
Do you kids like magic?

11:29.250 --> 11:30.665
Yeah! Yay! Yeah!

11:30.791 --> 11:34.124
Okay, well, let's all give
a cheer for the Amazingly Randi!

11:34.250 --> 11:36.999
Hey, kids, are we having fun?

11:37.125 --> 11:38.915
Oh, where'd my hat go?

11:39.041 --> 11:40.749
Anyone seen my hat?

11:42.333 --> 11:43.957
Okay.
The magician started.

11:44.083 --> 11:45.665
Let's get the cake ready.

11:45.791 --> 11:49.165
Now, some of you might think
that this is a little crazy.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.790
But if you believe in magic...

11:51.916 --> 11:53.249
You'll find that --

11:53.375 --> 11:55.624
Ow! Ow!

11:55.750 --> 11:58.540
Oh, God!
Can somebody help?! Please!

11:58.666 --> 12:01.582
They're getting
a kick out of the magician, huh?

12:02.750 --> 12:03.790
God, somebody help me out!

12:03.916 --> 12:05.415
Can somebody -- You!
Little girl!

12:05.541 --> 12:08.415
Can you please just --
just check behind your ear?

12:11.416 --> 12:13.124
Oh, it was behind her ear!

12:15.166 --> 12:17.124
And there we go,
we're all better,

12:17.250 --> 12:18.707
and I am the Amazingly Randi.

12:18.833 --> 12:19.874
Thank you.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.457
I hate you!

12:22.916 --> 12:24.582
Dude, it was so badass.

12:24.708 --> 12:26.874
Our guy slaughtered
every other fighter there,

12:27.000 --> 12:28.957
and now he's moving up
to the real hard-core shit.

12:29.083 --> 12:31.415
It was seriously about
the greatest night of our lives.

12:31.541 --> 12:33.457
- Where was all this?
- We can't tell you, bro.

12:33.583 --> 12:35.332
It's, like, hard-core,
underground shit.

12:35.458 --> 12:36.790
Yeah.
You got to know people.

12:36.916 --> 12:38.499
Dang it.
I wish I knew people.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.332
All right, kids,
before we get started,

12:40.458 --> 12:42.415
the coach of the girls'
volleyball team is here

12:42.541 --> 12:44.124
and would like to say
a few words.

12:44.250 --> 12:45.790
Thank you, Mr. Garrison.

12:45.916 --> 12:46.874
Listen, uh, last night,

12:47.000 --> 12:48.874
we had a pretty big game
against Evergreen.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.040
The girls really hammered them,
but once again

12:51.166 --> 12:53.582
we're, uh, a little disappointed
in the turnout.

12:53.708 --> 12:55.957
Oh, Jesus.
Give it a rest already.

12:56.083 --> 12:57.207
Yeah.

12:57.333 --> 12:59.124
You know, when you put your all
into something,

12:59.250 --> 13:01.374
it's kind of a bummer
when people don't seem to care.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.249
Kind of makes you feel like
the sport you love

13:03.375 --> 13:04.624
is becoming a joke.

13:04.750 --> 13:05.915
Dude, girls' volleyball
isn't a joke.

13:06.041 --> 13:07.415
Jokes are hard
and require skill.

13:07.541 --> 13:09.790
Oh!

13:09.916 --> 13:11.707
Fantastic girls' volleyball
joke, Stan.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.249
The girls
wanted to say something,

13:14.375 --> 13:15.832
so we're now
gonna hear a few words

13:15.958 --> 13:17.957
from the captain
of the girls' volleyball team.

13:19.875 --> 13:20.790
Hey, guys.

13:20.916 --> 13:22.249
These games coming up
are really big,

13:22.375 --> 13:23.832
and it would mean a lot to us
if you could try and make it.

13:23.958 --> 13:24.957
Thanks.

13:29.625 --> 13:31.915
Dude, Wendy plays volleyball.

13:32.041 --> 13:35.749
Did you know that?
I don't think you knew that.

13:38.333 --> 13:41.540
And then he, uh, took his penis
from behind our daughter's ear

13:41.666 --> 13:43.957
and, uh, we, uh --
that's when we saw him

13:44.083 --> 13:46.999
with, uh, the three rings
and his penis.

13:47.125 --> 13:49.457
He was pulling it
through them somehow.

13:49.583 --> 13:50.665
Uh-huh.

13:50.791 --> 13:53.415
And what about the Cock Magic?
Where was that?

13:53.541 --> 13:55.999
That's what I'm telling you.
It was right here.

13:56.125 --> 13:57.165
Except -- Except for the thing

13:57.291 --> 13:58.790
where he poured the milk
into his penis.

13:58.916 --> 13:59.790
He did that over there.

13:59.916 --> 14:01.249
All right. All right.
Let's try and focus.

14:01.375 --> 14:03.082
What kind of decks
were they using?

14:03.208 --> 14:05.040
- Decks?
- Who?

14:05.166 --> 14:06.874
There -- There weren't
any decks.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.874
Oh.
I get it now.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.374
Do you know
what the penalty is

14:11.500 --> 14:13.582
for calling in
a false Cock Magic report?

14:13.708 --> 14:15.707
I'm so confused,
babe.

14:15.833 --> 14:16.790
Who paid you to call us

14:16.916 --> 14:18.749
and take our focus away
from the investigation?

14:18.875 --> 14:21.165
- What color were they?
- Nobody paid us anything!

14:21.291 --> 14:23.207
Now, there has been
a crime here,

14:23.333 --> 14:25.040
and you better
do something about it!

14:25.166 --> 14:28.249
Agreed.
Who first called 911?

14:28.375 --> 14:31.457
Please! Don't take me
away from my child!

14:31.583 --> 14:32.707
Mommy!

14:34.875 --> 14:38.040
This is it.
1421 Plaza de Estereotipo.

14:38.166 --> 14:40.665
Wow.
Here we are, McNuggets.

14:40.791 --> 14:42.457
You've reached the big time.

14:49.041 --> 14:50.915
Sorry. Panda Express is crosed.
We crosed.

14:51.041 --> 14:52.165
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:52.291 --> 14:53.707
We're here
for the Cock Magic.

14:53.833 --> 14:55.540
Oh, okay. Come on.
10 darra. 10 darra.

14:55.666 --> 14:57.790
10 darra?!

15:00.083 --> 15:02.040
For the next round,

15:02.166 --> 15:07.207
it is Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds,
versus Clucky.

15:07.333 --> 15:08.249
Who is that?

15:08.375 --> 15:10.832
That's Gadnuk,
Breaker of Worlds.

15:12.083 --> 15:13.332
He's never lost a fight.

15:13.458 --> 15:16.082
Hell, he's never even
lost one health.

15:22.208 --> 15:23.082
What do you mean?

15:23.208 --> 15:24.957
Is he a Red Mage
or a Green Mage?

15:25.083 --> 15:26.332
Dude, he's, like, a beast.

15:26.458 --> 15:28.707
He's got more legendary creature
cards than I've ever seen.

15:28.833 --> 15:30.915
McNuggets is scared!
He doesn't want to play!

15:31.041 --> 15:32.499
McNuggets is scared, dude.

15:32.625 --> 15:34.999
Can you stack his deck
with more mana?

15:35.125 --> 15:37.957
Can you stack McNuggets' deck
with more mana?!

15:38.083 --> 15:39.874
He didn't stand a chance.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.874
Not one spell cast before he was
obliterated by health drains.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.582
That thing isn't human!

15:49.458 --> 15:51.665
All right.
Your rooster's up next, boys.

15:51.791 --> 15:53.832
I don't think
he wants to play, dude.

15:53.958 --> 15:55.415
He doesn't have a choice.

15:55.541 --> 15:58.915
But this isn't even a fight.
This is just a slaughter.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.832
What do you think all
these people are here to see?

16:01.958 --> 16:02.957
Holy shit, dude!

16:03.083 --> 16:04.665
Dude, we forfeit!
We forfeit!

16:04.791 --> 16:09.290
The hell you do!
Get your cock in there.

16:10.625 --> 16:12.957
You're watching ESPN Illegal,

16:13.083 --> 16:16.915
your source for bull fighting,
dog fighting, and Cock Magic.

16:17.041 --> 16:20.207
And a warm welcome back
to the Cock Magic championships.

16:20.333 --> 16:22.040
Certainly an electric atmosphere

16:22.166 --> 16:23.832
here in the basement
of Panda Express.

16:23.958 --> 16:26.165
The fight we were expecting,
of course --

16:26.291 --> 16:27.415
Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds,

16:27.541 --> 16:30.957
versus 10-month-old
Cornish rooster McNuggets.

16:31.083 --> 16:32.832
In a complete shocker,
the challenger, McNuggets,

16:32.958 --> 16:33.957
has been scratched,

16:34.083 --> 16:37.999
and substituting for him
is 9-year-old Kenny McCormick.

16:38.125 --> 16:41.540
Never a dull moment in
the illegal sport of Cock Magic.

16:41.666 --> 16:46.582
Let's rejoin the battle now as
we wait for Gadnuk's sixth move.

16:52.125 --> 16:55.165
Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds,
plays a creature card.

16:55.291 --> 16:57.499
Jesus,
Paragon of Fierce Defiance.

16:57.625 --> 16:59.040
Now every red creature
Gadnuk plays

16:59.166 --> 17:00.332
will have a plus-one attack.

17:03.041 --> 17:04.874
Come on, Kenny.

17:11.875 --> 17:14.040
What did he play?
Did he tap all his mana?

17:14.166 --> 17:15.790
Dude, he just cast
Psychogenic Probe.

17:15.916 --> 17:17.790
Now every time the other rooster
has to shuffle his deck,

17:17.916 --> 17:18.790
he loses two health.

17:18.916 --> 17:19.790
He just had to shuffle it.

17:19.916 --> 17:21.957
Did you hear that?
He's shuffling the deck already.

17:22.083 --> 17:24.290
The only thing he's got on the
battleground now is an Overseer.

17:24.416 --> 17:25.957
Does an Overseer
have trample?

17:26.041 --> 17:28.582
Does an Overseer
have trample?!

17:28.708 --> 17:30.249
A second Elvish Mystic now,

17:30.375 --> 17:33.290
and Gadnuk attacks
with Merciful Pretender.

17:33.416 --> 17:35.540
McCormick sends Charging Rhino
to the graveyard.

17:35.666 --> 17:38.124
He's desperate now.
Not too much he can --

17:38.250 --> 17:41.415
Oh! And he's just laid down
Life's Legacy!

17:41.541 --> 17:43.957
That was not expected!

17:44.083 --> 17:45.790
Gadnuk doesn't know
what hit him!

17:45.916 --> 17:50.415
McCormick follows with Crackling
Doom and Abzan Battle Priest!

17:50.541 --> 17:51.540
Holy shit, dude!

17:51.666 --> 17:53.957
Gadnuk tries to block
with Living Totem, but --

17:54.083 --> 17:56.124
Oh!
There is Terra Stomper!

17:56.250 --> 17:58.374
This is absolute savagery!

17:58.500 --> 18:00.457
Frenzied Goblin
has been sent to the graveyard,

18:00.583 --> 18:03.290
and now there is no one
to block Pearl Lake Ancient!

18:03.416 --> 18:05.957
My God! Someone has to
put a stop to this!

18:06.083 --> 18:08.082
Freeze!

18:12.625 --> 18:14.124
Well, well.

18:14.250 --> 18:16.999
Looks like
I finally caught the big boys.

18:17.125 --> 18:19.957
You're all going to jail
for a long time,

18:20.083 --> 18:21.957
especially you, scumbag!

18:22.083 --> 18:24.415
Lousy cops.
How did you find us?

18:24.541 --> 18:25.999
We saw your flyers.

18:26.125 --> 18:29.332
"Panda Express.
Cock magic at 9:00 p.m."

18:29.458 --> 18:31.249
We didn't put those flyers out.

18:31.375 --> 18:34.332
And now, for your
half-time entertainment,

18:34.458 --> 18:36.499
please welcome the incomparable,

18:36.625 --> 18:40.832
the beautiful,
the Amazingly Randi.

18:42.416 --> 18:44.207
Uh, dude, your dad's here.

18:44.333 --> 18:46.040
Thank you! Hey!

18:46.166 --> 18:50.290
You know, we live in a world
of brutality and violence.

18:50.416 --> 18:53.290
And some people think there's
no room for wonder anymore.

All right, for this last bit,
I'm gonna need a volunteer.

19:57.583 --> 19:58.457
Anybody?

19:58.583 --> 20:00.790
I'll volunteer.

20:00.916 --> 20:02.249
All right.
Come on up here.

20:02.375 --> 20:03.249
What's your name?

20:03.375 --> 20:05.790
I'm Detective Harris,
South Park Police.

20:05.916 --> 20:08.249
All right, a hand
for Detective Harris.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.874
You know, if there's one thing
I could leave you all with,

20:12.000 --> 20:13.082
it's this --

20:13.208 --> 20:16.374
let cock magic be done
by the professionals.

20:16.500 --> 20:17.374
Sir?

20:48.250 --> 20:49.874
It was so hard-core,
you guys.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.790
Kenny laid waste
to Gadnuk, Breaker of Worlds.

20:52.916 --> 20:54.582
It got so out of hand
that the fucking cops

20:54.708 --> 20:56.124
had to come
and break it up.

20:56.250 --> 20:57.624
- Wow! The cops came?
- Yeah.

20:57.750 --> 21:00.332
It was seriously the most manly
thing that's ever happened.

21:00.458 --> 21:01.624
Kenny cast Glacial Crasher,

21:01.750 --> 21:03.332
and then Stan's dad
shot his dick off.

21:03.458 --> 21:05.624
I just -- I seriously don't know
where we go from here.

21:05.750 --> 21:06.707
You all right, Kenny?

21:06.833 --> 21:07.707
Mrph rmh rmphm.

21:07.833 --> 21:09.332
Mrph rmh rmh
rmphm mrph rmphm.

21:09.458 --> 21:11.290
Hey, yeah.
What about poor McNuggets?

21:11.416 --> 21:12.457
What's he gonna do now?

21:12.583 --> 21:14.165
Wait a minute.
I've got it, you guys.

21:14.291 --> 21:15.165
Got what?

21:15.291 --> 21:18.290
A way to finally do something
good for other people.

21:25.083 --> 21:27.457
South Park serves,

21:27.583 --> 21:29.999
and McNuggets
plays a Plains land card.

21:30.125 --> 21:31.874
1-nil, South Park.

21:35.583 --> 21:36.749
Another serve.

21:36.875 --> 21:39.957
And McNuggets
summons Dawntreader Elk.

21:40.083 --> 21:42.332
One South Park player
is eliminated.

21:42.458 --> 21:45.540
You, the girl with
the ponytails -- You are dead.
