WEBVTT

02:18.611 --> 02:21.115
Who'll pinch me
to wake me up?

02:26.794 --> 02:28.898
Who will laugh at me
when I fall?

02:33.708 --> 02:35.879
Whose breath will
I listen for...

02:38.751 --> 02:41.857
...so that I may sleep?

02:41.891 --> 02:47.703
Whose hand will I hold...

02:47.736 --> 02:50.509
...so that I may walk?

03:05.371 --> 03:08.845
(man) We may question
ourselves

03:08.878 --> 03:12.385
at moments such as these.

03:14.657 --> 03:16.894
Did we make the right
decision to settle here?

03:28.083 --> 03:31.857
We are grateful for the time
we have been given.

03:46.654 --> 03:49.359
(murmuring)

03:49.392 --> 03:52.699
(thunderclap)

03:52.733 --> 03:55.003
(moaning)

06:19.358 --> 06:22.264
What manner of spectacle
has attracted your attention

06:22.297 --> 06:24.268
so splendidly? I ought to
carry it in my pocket

06:24.301 --> 06:26.773
to help me teach.

06:28.878 --> 06:31.149
(flies buzzing)

06:35.123 --> 06:37.127
Who came upon this?

06:41.335 --> 06:44.877
Philip, did you
move this?
No, Mr. Walker.

06:44.910 --> 06:47.347
(flies buzzing)

06:53.326 --> 06:56.165
I inspected it carefully.
Its head was twisted back

06:56.199 --> 06:58.905
and much of its
fur removed.
I see.

06:58.938 --> 07:01.175
It was murdered.

07:01.209 --> 07:03.313
(Walker) But who
is the culprit?

07:03.346 --> 07:07.154
Who has done this
heinous act?

07:07.187 --> 07:11.395
Those We Don't
Speak Of killed it.
There it is.

07:11.429 --> 07:15.103
Why would such a notion
come into your mind?

07:16.907 --> 07:18.945
They're meat eaters.
Mmm.

07:18.978 --> 07:21.883
They have large claws.

07:21.917 --> 07:24.055
Children...

07:24.088 --> 07:26.292
...Those We Don't Speak Of

07:26.325 --> 07:30.367
have not breached our
borders for many years.

07:30.400 --> 07:34.075
We do not go
into their woods,

07:34.108 --> 07:37.247
they do not come
into our valley.

07:37.281 --> 07:39.385
It is a truce.

07:39.418 --> 07:41.957
We do not threaten them.

07:41.991 --> 07:44.228
Why would they do this?

07:44.261 --> 07:49.305
And we ought not to overlook
the Flight of the Birds.

07:49.338 --> 07:52.244
We didn't have it last year
and I, for one,

07:52.277 --> 07:55.183
missed it desperately.
(laughs)

07:55.217 --> 07:58.423
And I know your wife
missed the children

07:58.456 --> 08:01.429
dressed in feathers
and such.
I am fond of it.

08:01.462 --> 08:03.266
Mmm.

08:03.299 --> 08:06.205
I do not have a say
in this matter.

08:06.239 --> 08:08.544
August Nicholson is chair
of today's meeting.

08:08.577 --> 08:11.282
(knocking/door opens)

08:11.315 --> 08:13.119
(man) There's a young man
who has requested

08:13.153 --> 08:16.292
a word with the elders.

08:16.325 --> 08:18.897
Well, do have him
come forward.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.171
Alice.

08:25.443 --> 08:27.381
(August) Hello, Lucius.

08:33.359 --> 08:37.534
"My mother is unaware of
the reason for my visit today.

08:37.568 --> 08:39.505
"She did not
give her consent

08:39.539 --> 08:45.951
or consult me
in any form.

08:45.984 --> 08:49.425
"The passing of little
Daniel Nicholson from illness,

08:49.458 --> 08:53.032
"and other events,
have weighed on my thoughts.

08:53.065 --> 08:57.307
"I ask permission to cross
into the forbidden woods

08:57.341 --> 08:59.445
"and travel to
the nearest town.

08:59.478 --> 09:03.453
"I will gather new medicines,
and I will return.

09:03.486 --> 09:06.325
"With regards to
Those We Don't Speak Of,

09:06.359 --> 09:09.265
"I am certain they
will let me pass.

09:09.298 --> 09:13.574
"Creatures can sense
emotion and fear.

09:13.607 --> 09:17.481
"They will see I am pure
of intention, and not afraid.

09:17.514 --> 09:19.351
The end."

09:27.167 --> 09:30.006
(Alice) What goes on
in that head of yours?

09:32.311 --> 09:34.348
Say something, Lucius.

09:38.323 --> 09:40.560
Finton Coin is
in the tower,

09:40.594 --> 09:43.132
and I've promised
to sit with him.

09:43.165 --> 09:44.535
Hmm.

09:47.441 --> 09:50.814
Do you ever think
of the towns, Finton?

09:50.848 --> 09:53.319
The towns?

09:53.353 --> 09:56.325
What for?

09:56.359 --> 09:58.496
They're wicked places
where wicked people live.

09:58.529 --> 10:01.302
That's all.

10:05.310 --> 10:08.850
Thank you, Lucius.

10:08.884 --> 10:11.455
You're a good friend.

10:15.162 --> 10:18.403
I do hope no one saw you.

10:18.436 --> 10:21.409
(howling)

10:32.531 --> 10:35.638
(flies buzzing)

10:41.482 --> 10:43.453
What we seem
to have amongst us

10:43.486 --> 10:46.425
is a predator
of some type,

10:46.459 --> 10:51.369
most likely a coyote
or a wolf.

10:52.805 --> 10:56.612
Its manner of... of killing
and removing the fur,

10:56.645 --> 10:59.886
but leaving
the flesh torn,

10:59.919 --> 11:05.329
may be a sign that this animal
suffers from madness.

11:05.363 --> 11:08.469
And for the next fortnight,
we should be vigilant

11:08.503 --> 11:11.308
for sightings
of this coyote.

11:11.341 --> 11:14.347
Keep careful watch
over our little ones

11:14.381 --> 11:16.720
as they play
on the hills.

11:19.391 --> 11:23.232
As for the other notion...

11:23.265 --> 11:27.373
...we do not believe our
boundary has been breached.

11:27.407 --> 11:30.513
Those We Don't Speak Of...

11:30.547 --> 11:35.356
are much larger creatures
than coyotes...

11:35.389 --> 11:39.364
...and we would know
if they had been here.

11:39.397 --> 11:41.970
(murmuring)

11:42.003 --> 11:44.541
(door opens)

11:44.575 --> 11:47.948
Ahh, it's frightful, this
business with the coyote.
Is it not, Papa?

11:47.982 --> 11:50.419
Do not feel
worried, Kitty.
You are not troubled?

11:50.453 --> 11:52.958
I'm certain it will
all end soon.

11:52.992 --> 11:55.329
Can we speak on
other matters, then?

11:55.362 --> 11:57.968
It would be a relief.

11:58.002 --> 12:00.573
I'm in love!

12:00.607 --> 12:03.613
I want your permission
to marry, Papa.

12:03.646 --> 12:06.786
There's a proper manner in which
things are supposed to happen!

12:06.820 --> 12:09.024
Such as, the boy would not
only be standing next to you,

12:09.057 --> 12:12.330
in a moment as this...
Where is the boy in all this,
Kitty?

12:12.363 --> 12:14.467
I haven't spoken to
him as of yet.

12:14.501 --> 12:18.108
The young man is unaware
of your intentions?

12:18.142 --> 12:20.346
He has a quiet way.

12:20.379 --> 12:23.118
I was going to talk with him,
Papa, but not without your
blessings.

12:23.152 --> 12:25.389
I won't talk with him
without your blessings.

12:25.422 --> 12:31.401
Kitty!
It's Lucius Hunt.

12:31.434 --> 12:34.708
Lucius?
You think badly of him?

12:36.178 --> 12:37.647
No, no. I've been thinking
about him recently.

12:37.681 --> 12:40.152
He's not like
the other boys, Papa.

12:40.186 --> 12:42.156
He doesn't joke
or bounce about.

12:42.190 --> 12:46.498
No, he certainly
does not.

12:46.531 --> 12:49.137
Do I have your
blessings, then?

12:51.208 --> 12:53.478
(sighs)

12:55.717 --> 12:58.522
Look, do me
one favor first.

12:58.555 --> 13:01.061
Do not tell anyone else
of your burstings

13:01.094 --> 13:03.633
until you have spoken
with the young man.

13:10.112 --> 13:12.784
Good afternoon,
Lucius.

13:16.591 --> 13:20.599
I wanted to... to
tell you something.

13:23.205 --> 13:25.710
I love you, Lucius.

13:26.946 --> 13:31.856
I love you... like the day
is long!

13:31.890 --> 13:34.527
I love you more than
the sun and the moon together.

13:34.560 --> 13:39.104
And if you feel the same way,
then we should not hide it
any longer.

13:39.137 --> 13:42.777
It's a gift, love is!
We should be thankful!

13:42.811 --> 13:46.719
We should bellow it out
with all the breath in
our lungs!

13:46.752 --> 13:48.288
Thank you!

13:48.322 --> 13:52.663
Thank you!
Thank you!

13:55.269 --> 13:58.175
(screaming/sobbing)

13:58.208 --> 14:00.981
Shh, shh.

14:01.014 --> 14:02.683
Shh.

14:04.587 --> 14:07.260
(sobbing)

14:07.293 --> 14:12.570
* Baby, sleep,
gently sleep

14:12.603 --> 14:17.781
* Life is long
and love is deep

14:17.814 --> 14:23.859
* Time will be
sweet for thee

14:23.894 --> 14:27.233
* All the world to see

14:27.266 --> 14:31.876
* Time to look about and know

14:31.910 --> 14:35.918
* How the shadows
come and go

14:35.951 --> 14:41.896
* How the breeze
stirs the trees

14:41.930 --> 14:45.669
* How the blossoms grow

14:56.859 --> 14:59.932
I often wondered if you
and my son bonded

14:59.966 --> 15:02.270
because neither of you
is fond of speaking.

15:02.303 --> 15:05.209
You're very kind.

15:05.242 --> 15:06.778
You must pardon
my manners.

15:06.811 --> 15:09.817
I haven't slept
in many nights.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.339
(man) You are doing capital,
Jamison.

15:20.372 --> 15:23.980
Just a few more moments, huh?
Gather your bravery.

15:24.014 --> 15:28.355
Do not jostle about so.
You'll ruin my shirt.

15:28.388 --> 15:30.826
(whimpering)

15:30.859 --> 15:33.832
(howling)

15:33.865 --> 15:36.838
They made a sound
when I made a sound,

15:36.871 --> 15:40.412
and they mimic
before they attack.
Have courage, man.

15:40.446 --> 15:42.783
That's a wives' tale.
It isn't true.

15:42.816 --> 15:45.889
Do not falter.
Steel yourself!

15:50.399 --> 15:53.538
(August) You know,
like a dog can smell you.

15:53.572 --> 15:55.409
Pardon me,
Mr. Nicholson?

15:55.442 --> 15:57.746
Hmm.

15:59.850 --> 16:04.060
You may run from sorrow,
as we have.

16:04.094 --> 16:06.431
Sorrow will find you.

16:09.137 --> 16:11.774
It can smell you.

16:28.175 --> 16:31.981
(rustling)

16:32.016 --> 16:34.887
(gasping)

16:38.495 --> 16:40.966
(rustling continues)

16:40.999 --> 16:43.905
(footsteps)

16:43.938 --> 16:46.644
(growl)

16:46.678 --> 16:49.417
(whimpering)

16:49.450 --> 16:53.158
(howling)

16:53.192 --> 16:55.028
Hurry.

17:01.974 --> 17:05.082
I didn't know you
could run so fast.

17:05.116 --> 17:07.453
We're still for running
and staying-- Hey!

17:07.486 --> 17:10.023
(laughing)

17:10.058 --> 17:11.461
(Kitty) Noah ought
to be punished.

17:11.493 --> 17:14.599
He whacked little Joseph
with a stick again.

17:14.634 --> 17:17.140
(crowd groans)

17:17.173 --> 17:19.577
Ouch!
(girl) No more hitting!
Put it down!

17:19.609 --> 17:22.049
Ow, ow, ow!

17:22.082 --> 17:24.053
(girl #2) Why don't
they grab it?

17:24.086 --> 17:26.458
(distant shouting)

17:34.174 --> 17:38.081
(woman) Noah Percy!

17:38.114 --> 17:40.619
Stop your fussing
right this moment.

17:40.652 --> 17:42.990
(murmuring/laughing)

17:53.578 --> 17:58.020
You're in trouble,
you know.
No hitting, no hitting.

17:58.053 --> 18:00.192
I'm to place you
in the quiet room.

18:00.226 --> 18:03.131
Um, I'll cry quarts.

18:03.164 --> 18:07.640
What if we strike a deal?
Yeah, capital idea.

18:07.673 --> 18:11.581
It would be prudent to keep our
deal a secret. Can you do that?

18:11.614 --> 18:16.157
Can I keep a secret?
Like a church mouse.

18:16.190 --> 18:17.826
You needn't go to
the quiet room

18:17.860 --> 18:20.566
if you a take an oath
to never strike

18:20.599 --> 18:24.173
any person again.

18:24.206 --> 18:26.778
No hitting, no hitting.
No. No hitting.

18:26.811 --> 18:31.754
No hitting, no hitting.
No hitting!

18:31.788 --> 18:35.060
The deal is struck.

18:39.236 --> 18:41.541
(sighs)

18:41.574 --> 18:44.146
We ought not return
right away, huh?

18:44.179 --> 18:48.154
What shall we do
with our stolen time?

18:48.187 --> 18:50.124
Hmm.
Hmm.

18:50.158 --> 18:53.164
Hmm. Shall we have
a foot race?
Yes.

18:53.197 --> 18:55.736
Up the hill to
the resting rock?
No cheating.

18:55.769 --> 18:57.272
What a deeply scandalous
thing to say.

18:57.306 --> 19:00.278
I insist you take that back.
Is that the school bell?

19:06.324 --> 19:08.595
(shouting)

19:08.628 --> 19:10.766
Ivy, you cheated!

19:10.799 --> 19:14.607
I know! I'm sorry!

19:14.640 --> 19:16.578
(giggling)

19:19.216 --> 19:20.752
Whoo!

19:40.358 --> 19:42.696
My sister cried a lot.

19:44.700 --> 19:48.006
You wonder how
I recognized you?

19:48.040 --> 19:51.848
Some people - just a handful,
mind you -

19:51.881 --> 19:53.852
give off the tiniest color.

19:53.885 --> 19:57.359
It's faint, like a haze.

19:57.392 --> 20:01.367
It's the only thing
I ever see in the darkness.

20:01.400 --> 20:05.909
Papa has it, too.

20:05.942 --> 20:08.046
Do you wonder what
your color is?

20:08.080 --> 20:09.884
Well, that I won't
tell you.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.721
It's not ladylike to
speak of such things.

20:11.754 --> 20:13.758
You shouldn't
even have asked.

20:13.792 --> 20:15.929
(bird flying)

20:20.706 --> 20:23.010
You run like a boy.

20:25.014 --> 20:27.319
Thank you.

20:32.128 --> 20:34.867
I know why you
denied my sister.

20:36.871 --> 20:39.810
When I was younger...

20:39.844 --> 20:43.384
...you used to hold
my arm when I walked.

20:43.417 --> 20:47.793
Then suddenly,
you stopped.

20:47.826 --> 20:51.734
One day, I even tripped in your
presence, and nearly fell.

20:51.768 --> 20:53.972
I was faking, of course,

20:54.005 --> 20:56.678
but still, you
did not hold me.

20:58.180 --> 21:00.719
Sometimes we don't do
things we want to do

21:00.752 --> 21:03.925
so that others won't know
we want to do them.

21:14.780 --> 21:16.517
What?
(frog croaks)

21:16.550 --> 21:19.055
(yelps/laughs)

21:27.071 --> 21:28.975
What's this?

21:29.008 --> 21:32.883
Oh, berries.
What a splendid present.

21:32.916 --> 21:35.054
(Lucius) Be cautious.

21:35.087 --> 21:37.793
You are holding
the bad color.

21:44.105 --> 21:46.744
This color attracts
Those We Don't Speak Of.

21:46.778 --> 21:48.948
You must bury it.

21:50.786 --> 21:54.125
You ought not to pick
that color berry any more.

21:55.294 --> 21:57.966
He picked it
from his pocket.

21:59.837 --> 22:03.110
What's wrong?
Your breathing has changed.

22:03.143 --> 22:06.149
(Lucius) I've never set
eyes on these before.

22:06.182 --> 22:09.890
You did not pick that now.
Where did you find this?

22:17.004 --> 22:20.545
"Today at Resting Rock,
Noah Percy handed Ivy Walker

22:20.578 --> 22:22.148
"berries of the bad color.

22:22.181 --> 22:25.054
"When asked where
he found these berries,

22:25.087 --> 22:27.224
"for they were not like
others I have seen,

22:27.258 --> 22:31.266
"he pointed to the drawing
upon Resting Rock.

22:31.299 --> 22:35.340
"It is my belief that Noah
Percy has entered the woods,

22:35.375 --> 22:39.750
"and has done so
on many occasions.

22:39.784 --> 22:42.856
"It is also my belief that,
because of his innocence,

22:42.890 --> 22:46.931
"those creatures who reside
in the woods did not harm him.

22:46.964 --> 22:50.304
"This strengthens my feeling
that they will let me pass

22:50.337 --> 22:53.812
if they sense I am
not a threat."

22:53.845 --> 22:58.120
(Alice) We shall speak of
the town, just this once,

22:58.153 --> 23:01.026
and we shall never
speak of it again.

23:04.198 --> 23:09.308
Your father left for
the market on a Tuesday,

23:09.342 --> 23:12.782
at a quarter past nine
in the morning.

23:15.455 --> 23:18.995
He was found
robbed and naked,

23:19.028 --> 23:22.334
in the filthy river,
two days later.

23:27.846 --> 23:30.952
Why'd you tell me
this blackness?

23:30.986 --> 23:35.294
So you will know the nature
of what you desire.

23:35.327 --> 23:37.298
I do not desire it.

23:37.331 --> 23:39.803
My intentions are true
to my word.

23:39.836 --> 23:42.041
I think of nothing but
the people of this village.

23:42.074 --> 23:47.051
Forgive me. I am but scared
for my only son's life.

23:47.084 --> 23:49.924
I am not the one
with secrets.

23:52.529 --> 23:55.200
What is your meaning?

23:55.234 --> 24:00.077
There are secrets in every
corner of this village.

24:00.110 --> 24:03.116
Do you not feel it?

24:03.150 --> 24:05.387
Do you not see it?

24:05.420 --> 24:08.193
That is for my own
well-being,

24:08.226 --> 24:10.197
so the evil things
from my past

24:10.230 --> 24:12.401
are kept close
and not forgotten.

24:12.434 --> 24:15.074
Forgetting would be to let them
be born again in another form.

24:15.107 --> 24:19.215
Then let us open it.
No!

24:19.248 --> 24:22.221
Perhaps we should speak
with Edward Walker together.

24:22.254 --> 24:25.996
He may be able--
He hides, too.

24:26.029 --> 24:28.400
He hides his
feelings for you.

24:28.433 --> 24:31.206
Oh.

24:39.188 --> 24:41.927
Sometimes we
don't do things,

24:41.960 --> 24:45.300
yet others know we want to do
things, so we don't do them.

24:50.144 --> 24:53.416
What nonsense
are you saying?

24:57.058 --> 24:59.295
You needn't worry.

24:59.328 --> 25:02.201
Nothing will happen to me.

25:04.539 --> 25:08.514
You remind me of
a colt sometimes.

25:15.595 --> 25:19.135
What makes you think
he has feelings for me?

25:23.076 --> 25:25.447
He never touches you.

27:08.586 --> 27:11.459
(growling)

27:14.432 --> 27:17.170
(rustling)

27:34.505 --> 27:36.642
(growling)

27:40.384 --> 27:42.689
There's no escape!

27:44.993 --> 27:48.366
Oh, hello.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.671
I was just playing
a game with Noah.

27:50.705 --> 27:54.478
The rascal must have gone
to hide in my house again.

27:54.512 --> 27:56.382
(loudly) Houses are
against the rules!

27:56.416 --> 27:58.520
(whispering) He knows that.

28:01.025 --> 28:05.366
Are you all right?

28:05.400 --> 28:09.007
We're tending to the children
tonight, Kitty and I.

28:09.041 --> 28:12.280
I should be with her.
Be well.

28:17.624 --> 28:21.031
I heard my parents
speaking of you.

28:21.065 --> 28:25.273
I know of your request
to go to the towns.

28:25.306 --> 28:29.548
I think it is noble, but I
do not think it is right.

28:29.582 --> 28:31.753
Are you not angry
you have no sight?

28:33.422 --> 28:37.664
I see the world,
Lucius Hunt.

28:37.698 --> 28:40.470
Just not as
you see it.

28:47.450 --> 28:50.456
What of Noah, then?

28:50.490 --> 28:52.694
What if there are
medicines for Noah

28:52.728 --> 28:56.101
that could help him
be still and to learn?

28:56.135 --> 28:59.743
May we stop speaking of this?
It is putting knots
in my stomach.

29:05.019 --> 29:06.656
Kitty is to be married.

29:09.161 --> 29:12.367
She's found love, again,

29:12.400 --> 29:14.705
with Christop Crane.

29:14.738 --> 29:17.711
You think it
an odd choice, right?

29:17.744 --> 29:19.748
You know, he won't sit
back in his chair for fear

29:19.783 --> 29:23.389
of setting wrinkles
on his shirts.

29:23.422 --> 29:26.495
But he does have a gentlemanly
way about him...

29:26.528 --> 29:31.071
...and he does care
for my sister deeply.

29:32.540 --> 29:34.411
I think Kitty is blessed.

29:38.485 --> 29:41.458
I am blessed as well.

29:41.491 --> 29:44.598
My older sister
is now spoken for.

29:44.632 --> 29:47.570
I am now free to receive
interest from anyone...

29:49.775 --> 29:52.013
...who might
have interest.

29:55.921 --> 29:58.592
(children laughing)

30:02.533 --> 30:04.071
I'm going to get you!

30:04.104 --> 30:07.077
Ohh, I got you!
I got you!

30:07.110 --> 30:09.114
Can you fetch a blanket for me?

30:09.147 --> 30:11.218
(Ivy) Have you seen Noah?

30:26.548 --> 30:28.686
(loud thump)

30:30.156 --> 30:32.227
Lucius?

30:49.194 --> 30:51.933
Lucius?

30:54.037 --> 30:56.175
(growling)

30:56.208 --> 30:58.145
(whimpers)

31:05.895 --> 31:09.234
(gasping)

31:37.323 --> 31:40.296
(man) Hurry, to the cellar!
(woman) Oh, good gracious!

31:40.329 --> 31:42.969
(bell ringing/shouting)

31:59.501 --> 32:02.207
They're coming!
They're coming!
Close the door!

32:02.240 --> 32:04.344
Noah, close
the door, OK?
They're coming!

32:04.377 --> 32:08.852
Close the door.
Coming!

32:08.886 --> 32:11.325
Here we go.

32:11.358 --> 32:14.932
Noah, come on inside!
(Noah) Come on inside!

32:14.966 --> 32:18.906
(man) Everyone, inside!
Everyone, inside!

32:32.400 --> 32:34.437
(bell ringing)

32:35.473 --> 32:37.443
(grunting)

32:41.518 --> 32:45.493
(Noah) They're coming!
Come on in!
Just close the door!

32:45.526 --> 32:48.299
Lucius is outside,
walking.

32:48.332 --> 32:51.505
They're coming!
He's inside
safe somewhere!

32:51.538 --> 32:53.942
Please, close the door!

32:56.115 --> 32:58.952
He'll come back to
make sure we're safe.

32:58.987 --> 33:01.458
Ivy! Ivy, please!

33:08.405 --> 33:11.011
(heavy footsteps)

33:17.990 --> 33:20.496
(scratching)

33:20.529 --> 33:22.900
(growling)

33:29.581 --> 33:33.922
(Kitty) Please.
No.

33:33.955 --> 33:36.128
Don't let them in.

33:40.969 --> 33:43.575
(grunting)

33:43.609 --> 33:46.148
(growling)

34:21.217 --> 34:24.757
Come on in.

34:24.791 --> 34:27.630
(thumping)

34:32.806 --> 34:35.646
(rumbling)

34:40.489 --> 34:42.592
(rustling)

34:48.839 --> 34:50.809
(thumping)

34:50.842 --> 34:53.148
(loud thump)

34:53.181 --> 34:56.420
(hinges creaking)

35:05.639 --> 35:11.618
(Walker) By the markings
we find this morning
on our homes...

35:11.651 --> 35:17.530
...I feel they were warning us.
They acted as if threatened.

35:17.563 --> 35:21.204
(August) Creatures have never
attacked us without reason.

35:21.237 --> 35:26.147
Does anyone here
know of a reason...

35:26.180 --> 35:29.085
...why these events
may have occurred?

35:36.601 --> 35:38.839
Who has written
this note?

35:48.692 --> 35:51.831
(clears throat)

35:51.865 --> 35:54.504
"Please read so
that all may hear.

35:54.537 --> 35:59.847
"I have brought this
burden upon us.

35:59.881 --> 36:01.951
"On the day before
last, I...

36:01.985 --> 36:06.795
crossed the forbidden line
into Covington Woods..."
(crowd gasps)

36:06.828 --> 36:10.969
"...and was witnessed there
by Those We Don't Speak Of.

36:11.003 --> 36:13.642
"I am deeply sorry.

36:13.675 --> 36:17.650
"I have shamed myself
and my family.

36:17.683 --> 36:21.525
"I pray that my actions
will cause no further pains.

36:21.558 --> 36:24.931
With deepest sorrow,
Lucius Hunt."

36:24.964 --> 36:27.202
(crowd murmuring)

36:54.924 --> 36:58.298
Is he in trouble?
(laughing)

37:09.353 --> 37:12.693
Do not fret.

37:20.141 --> 37:24.884
You are fearless in a way
that I shall never know.

37:31.898 --> 37:34.604
(overlapping chatter)

37:36.073 --> 37:39.145
(Walker) We are grateful...

37:39.179 --> 37:41.985
...for the time
we have been given.

37:42.018 --> 37:45.492
(man) Yes. Yes, indeed.

37:45.525 --> 37:48.431
(crowd laughs)

37:48.464 --> 37:50.703
(overlapping) Cheers.

38:31.149 --> 38:33.789
(distant singing)

38:33.822 --> 38:37.128
I had an elder sister.

38:37.161 --> 38:42.539
Mrs. Clack, you've
been keeping secrets.

38:42.572 --> 38:45.846
Oh, Kitty reminds
me of her so.

38:47.983 --> 38:52.727
(Ivy) What manner
of person was she?

38:52.760 --> 38:55.131
Saucy.
Oh.

38:55.164 --> 38:57.770
And we fought
endlessly.

39:02.245 --> 39:05.017
May I ask her name?

39:07.255 --> 39:10.929
Why did she not come
to Covington Woods?

39:16.039 --> 39:20.047
My sister did not live
past her 23rd birthday.

39:21.885 --> 39:26.093
A group of men took her life
in an alley by our home.

39:28.999 --> 39:31.369
Please rise!

39:31.404 --> 39:33.741
Come on.

39:33.775 --> 39:36.113
(overlapping chatter)

40:06.975 --> 40:13.788
She's not gonna squeeze
my shirt like that, is she?

40:13.821 --> 40:15.926
(murmuring)

40:23.007 --> 40:27.248
Many blessings on this
most joyous of days.

40:27.281 --> 40:30.221
It was a rare and lovely
ceremony, was it not?

40:30.254 --> 40:32.191
Glorious.

40:35.064 --> 40:37.001
I saw your hand
move to your eyes

40:37.035 --> 40:39.239
on more than
one occasion.

40:39.272 --> 40:42.211
That must have been
dust of some matter.

41:49.513 --> 41:51.183
(scream)

41:56.560 --> 41:58.230
(scream)

42:01.236 --> 42:02.939
(scream)

42:02.972 --> 42:05.211
(boy) Mr. Walker!

42:09.385 --> 42:12.959
(boy) Mr. Walker!
(boy #2) Mr. Walker!

42:12.992 --> 42:15.932
(murmuring)

42:15.965 --> 42:18.370
(man) Behind them.

42:18.403 --> 42:20.542
(man #2) How did she deal
with this brightness?

42:20.575 --> 42:23.948
(woman) Help us out.

42:23.981 --> 42:25.484
(man #3) Where are
the rest of them?

42:30.127 --> 42:32.599
Speak up.

42:32.632 --> 42:35.003
They're in the village.

42:35.036 --> 42:38.143
What?
They left more warnings.

42:38.177 --> 42:40.481
They wish us to leave.

42:40.514 --> 42:42.986
That cannot be.

42:43.019 --> 42:46.092
One saw us.

42:46.125 --> 42:48.163
It ran off into
the darkness.

42:48.197 --> 42:51.203
You are certain?

42:58.317 --> 43:00.354
Can you boys stay
close to Ivy here?

43:00.387 --> 43:02.358
She'll tell you
some funny stories

43:02.391 --> 43:12.144
and have you
laughing soon.

43:12.177 --> 43:14.382
We will go together.

43:19.626 --> 43:22.398
(children whimpering)

44:11.496 --> 44:14.635
(Alice) Livestock has been
taken and skinned.

44:14.670 --> 44:18.377
The hides and feathers
are missing.

44:18.410 --> 44:22.886
There are marks on the door
where it was opened.

44:26.325 --> 44:29.465
The marks are high.

44:29.499 --> 44:33.373
Coyotes cannot reach
that height.

45:10.815 --> 45:12.651
(gasps)

45:35.063 --> 45:38.838
(Ivy) The elders are going
to have an inquiry tomorrow.

45:38.871 --> 45:41.342
Each member of the village
is to be questioned

45:41.375 --> 45:43.613
in the meeting hall.

45:43.647 --> 45:46.118
(Lucius) To see how
the border was breached?

45:46.152 --> 45:47.989
(Ivy) Yes.

45:52.866 --> 45:55.070
It is cold outside.

45:55.103 --> 45:57.074
You ought to go in.

45:59.846 --> 46:02.585
Why are you
on this porch?

46:03.888 --> 46:06.158
It is not safe.

46:06.192 --> 46:08.597
There are
other porches.

46:11.703 --> 46:14.609
Do you find me
too much of a tomboy?

46:15.912 --> 46:19.418
I do long to
do boy things...

46:19.451 --> 46:22.859
...like that game the boys
play at the stump.

46:22.892 --> 46:26.065
They put their backs
to the woods,

46:26.098 --> 46:31.542
and see how long they can
wait before getting scared.

46:31.575 --> 46:33.780
That's so exciting.

46:35.651 --> 46:39.725
I understand you
hold the record.

46:39.759 --> 46:43.499
It will never be
broken, they say.

46:43.532 --> 46:47.641
It's just
children's games.

46:47.675 --> 46:49.913
How is it you are brave
when all the rest of us

46:49.946 --> 46:53.753
shake in our boots?

46:53.787 --> 46:56.659
I do not worry about
what will happen,

46:56.693 --> 46:59.799
only what needs
to be done.

47:03.206 --> 47:05.143
How did you
know I was here?

47:05.176 --> 47:08.817
I saw you out
the window.

47:08.851 --> 47:11.622
No...

47:11.655 --> 47:14.228
...I won't tell
you your color.

47:14.261 --> 47:16.699
Stop asking.

47:21.242 --> 47:25.150
When we are married,
will you dance with me?

47:25.183 --> 47:28.589
I find dancing
very agreeable.

47:33.699 --> 47:36.705
Why can you not say
what is in your head?

47:39.745 --> 47:43.219
Why can you not stop saying
what is in yours?

47:45.223 --> 47:49.765
Why must you lead
when I want to lead?

47:49.799 --> 47:53.372
If I want to dance,
I will ask you to dance.

47:53.406 --> 47:57.747
If I want to speak, I will
open my mouth and speak.

47:59.251 --> 48:03.894
Everyone is forever
plaguing me to speak further.

48:03.928 --> 48:06.332
Why? What good is it
to tell you

48:06.365 --> 48:08.736
you are in my every thought
from the time I wake?

48:08.769 --> 48:10.740
What good can come
from my saying I...

48:10.773 --> 48:12.744
I sometimes cannot
think clearly,

48:12.777 --> 48:15.750
or do my work
properly?

48:15.783 --> 48:18.756
What gain can rise
from my telling you

48:18.789 --> 48:22.865
the only time I feel
fear as others do...

48:22.898 --> 48:25.670
...is when I think
of you in harm?

48:27.875 --> 48:31.715
That is why I am on
this porch, Ivy Walker.

48:32.986 --> 48:36.725
I fear for your safety
before all others.

48:40.901 --> 48:44.808
And, yes...

48:44.841 --> 48:47.747
...I will dance with you
on our wedding night.

49:06.954 --> 49:08.923
(woman) I had been to
the storage shed twice

49:08.958 --> 49:11.528
to fetch food prior to
the wedding ceremony.

49:11.562 --> 49:15.036
(Alice) And the livestock
was untouched at that time?

49:15.070 --> 49:18.376
(woman) Yes, Mrs. Hunt.
All was as it should be.

49:18.409 --> 49:20.813
Thank you, Beatrice.

49:28.429 --> 49:31.969
I beg your pardon.

49:32.004 --> 49:36.912
Is it true... about
Lucius and Ivy?

49:36.945 --> 49:39.451
There are whispers
all over the village.

49:43.159 --> 49:48.536
We were informed early this
morning of their intentions.

49:48.569 --> 49:52.944
It is amazing to witness
which two people
love chooses to unite.

49:52.977 --> 49:55.883
It follows no rules.

49:55.916 --> 50:00.326
Kitty... I wanted
to speak with you first.

50:02.097 --> 50:06.072
I would not want you to
feel pain, in any fashion.

50:07.040 --> 50:10.413
You are my
cherished one.

50:10.446 --> 50:14.421
If you were to feel badly about
Lucius, I would not have it.

50:14.454 --> 50:18.929
One love to sacrifice
another love is not right.

50:23.639 --> 50:25.943
There is nothing
you could do

50:25.976 --> 50:29.918
that would sacrifice
my love for you.

50:29.951 --> 50:32.557
You are my
cherished one as well.

50:41.575 --> 50:44.948
God bless you and
your life together.

50:53.632 --> 50:55.936
(knock on door)

51:02.550 --> 51:05.089
(wind blowing)

51:05.122 --> 51:07.025
What's happened?

51:15.176 --> 51:17.980
Is this about
Ivy and myself?

51:29.170 --> 51:33.145
I know you are
very fond of her.

51:33.178 --> 51:35.115
I know she
is fond of you.

51:41.528 --> 51:44.434
There are different
types of love.

52:06.144 --> 52:07.814
Oh.

52:14.928 --> 52:17.900
Oh, God.

52:17.934 --> 52:19.871
(wind blowing)

52:21.842 --> 52:24.147
(moaning)

52:30.192 --> 52:32.263
(continues moaning)

52:32.296 --> 52:34.834
Oh, Ivy...

52:38.342 --> 52:41.648
(groans)

52:57.714 --> 53:00.920
(rustling)
Noah?

53:00.953 --> 53:04.761
You'll be late
for the meeting hall.

53:04.794 --> 53:08.536
Would you like your father
to walk you there?

53:08.569 --> 53:10.906
(creaking)
Noah?

53:34.654 --> 53:36.892
Oh, the bad--

53:36.925 --> 53:39.297
The bad color!

53:41.702 --> 53:42.937
Oh!

53:46.444 --> 53:49.718
The bad color,
the bad color...

53:53.859 --> 53:56.063
(mouthing)

53:58.736 --> 54:00.706
Mama!

54:00.740 --> 54:02.810
(door opens)

54:07.152 --> 54:09.824
I beg your pardon.
What is it?

54:09.858 --> 54:11.728
There's been
an accident.

54:23.886 --> 54:27.827
Noah Percy was found
with quarts of blood

54:27.860 --> 54:29.998
upon his clothes
and hands.

54:30.031 --> 54:31.735
The blood was
not his own,

54:31.768 --> 54:33.672
and he will not speak
as to whose it is.

54:33.706 --> 54:36.444
God in heaven.

54:36.477 --> 54:38.047
Ivy!

54:38.080 --> 54:41.922
(man) Is there anyone
injured in here?

54:41.955 --> 54:44.928
(Alice) Has anyone
been hurt in this home?

54:46.230 --> 54:48.636
Is anyone in here?

54:48.669 --> 54:51.106
(Walker) Is anyone hurt
in this house?

54:57.954 --> 55:00.760
(muttering)

55:00.793 --> 55:04.132
22, 23, 24...

55:14.821 --> 55:18.127
31, 32, 33...

55:36.932 --> 55:39.002
Lucius?

55:41.742 --> 55:44.312
Lucius Hunt!

55:44.347 --> 55:48.087
You answer me
right this moment!

55:48.120 --> 55:50.893
(breeze blowing)

56:04.086 --> 56:06.290
(distant voices)

56:12.135 --> 56:15.141
(Walker) Is anyone hurt
in this house?

56:17.078 --> 56:19.249
(Walker) They're fine.

56:19.282 --> 56:21.988
Mr. Walker!

56:25.028 --> 56:26.932
(Walker) Joseph!

56:30.973 --> 56:35.048
Papa... I cannot see
his color.

56:41.193 --> 56:44.332
Ivy, come away.
Come away.

56:44.366 --> 56:46.136
(screams)
Come away!

56:46.170 --> 56:49.176
Here, take her!
Take her!

56:50.178 --> 56:52.148
(screams) No!

56:56.925 --> 57:01.033
(Mrs. Clack) He has
suffered a great deal.

57:01.066 --> 57:04.206
He may pass at any time.

57:08.214 --> 57:11.922
Please give him all your
prayers and good thoughts.

57:11.955 --> 57:14.192
He will hear them.

57:39.978 --> 57:41.847
(door unlocking)

58:01.020 --> 58:02.489
(whimpering)

58:05.028 --> 58:07.032
(man) Turn!

58:11.073 --> 58:12.408
(groans)

58:14.913 --> 58:17.485
(crying)

58:20.224 --> 58:22.262
(yelling/banging)

58:31.180 --> 58:33.918
(Ivy) I am in love.

58:33.951 --> 58:37.092
(Walker) I know.

58:37.125 --> 58:39.362
He is in love with me.

58:41.300 --> 58:44.038
I know.

58:45.040 --> 58:46.476
If he dies...

58:48.548 --> 58:51.386
...all that is life to me
will die with him.

58:55.128 --> 58:59.369
I ask permission...

58:59.402 --> 59:02.142
...to travel through
Covington Woods...

59:05.414 --> 59:07.418
...and go to the towns...

59:09.590 --> 59:12.328
...to retrieve medicines...

59:15.268 --> 59:17.338
...that may save...

59:19.442 --> 59:21.446
...Lucius Hunt.

59:33.170 --> 59:35.508
You are my father.

59:35.541 --> 59:38.347
I will listen to you
in all things.

59:41.052 --> 59:43.557
I will trust your decision.

59:49.336 --> 59:51.807
(man) I've done what I can
to close the wounds.

59:51.841 --> 59:54.647
There's an infection.

59:54.680 --> 59:57.285
What can be done
to mend him?

59:59.188 --> 01:00:01.460
We can only pray.

01:00:03.096 --> 01:00:06.436
If there were no limitations,
what could be done?

01:00:08.574 --> 01:00:12.415
Hmm? What are you
asking me?

01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:18.695
Is there anything
at all

01:00:18.728 --> 01:00:22.234
that can be done
to mend the boy?

01:00:26.443 --> 01:00:30.584
Please, Victor. Would you be so
kind as to answer my question?

01:00:39.201 --> 01:00:42.342
(Victor) If the infection
is contained, he may
still survive.

01:00:45.348 --> 01:00:49.489
I must speak up.

01:00:49.522 --> 01:00:52.528
You have a restless spirit.

01:00:52.562 --> 01:00:55.468
I know the thing
that is in your head.

01:00:57.338 --> 01:01:00.378
You're thinking of
going to the towns.

01:01:01.747 --> 01:01:05.354
Tell me I'm wrong!

01:01:05.388 --> 01:01:08.460
You have made
an oath, Edward,

01:01:08.494 --> 01:01:11.466
as all have,
never to go back.

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:13.470
It is a painful
bargain,

01:01:13.504 --> 01:01:15.374
but no good can come
without sacrifice.

01:01:15.408 --> 01:01:17.378
These are your
words I'm saying.

01:01:17.412 --> 01:01:19.248
You cannot
break the oath.

01:01:19.281 --> 01:01:21.486
It is sacred!
It is a crime,

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:26.229
what has happened
to Lucius.

01:01:26.262 --> 01:01:28.500
You have taken
the oath.

01:01:28.534 --> 01:01:32.341
You and the rest of the elders -
Are you listening to me?

01:01:32.374 --> 01:01:35.514
You...

01:01:35.548 --> 01:01:37.719
...have taken the oath.

01:02:04.005 --> 01:02:07.545
The moment I heard my daughter's
vision had finally failed her,

01:02:09.616 --> 01:02:11.452
and that she would
forever be blind,

01:02:11.486 --> 01:02:16.095
I was sitting in
that very chair.

01:02:16.129 --> 01:02:18.500
I was so ashamed.

01:02:22.675 --> 01:02:28.520
What do you know
about your grandfather?

01:02:28.554 --> 01:02:31.794
He was the wealthiest
man in the towns?

01:02:31.827 --> 01:02:35.133
That he was.
He had a gift for that.

01:02:35.167 --> 01:02:38.006
If he was given one dollar,
in less than a fortnight,

01:02:38.039 --> 01:02:42.014
he would have
turned it into five.

01:02:42.047 --> 01:02:45.153
You do not know of money.
It is not part of our life here.

01:02:45.187 --> 01:02:48.159
Money can be
a wicked thing.

01:02:48.193 --> 01:02:52.602
It can turn men's hearts black -
good men's hearts.

01:02:52.635 --> 01:02:56.442
My father could not see this.
For all his gifts,

01:02:56.475 --> 01:02:59.883
he was a poor judge
of a man's character.

01:02:59.917 --> 01:03:02.021
Your grandfather
was a good man, Ivy.

01:03:02.054 --> 01:03:04.558
He had a laugh that could
be heard three houses away.

01:03:04.592 --> 01:03:07.632
He used to hold my hand
as I hold yours.

01:03:07.665 --> 01:03:10.570
He taught me strength
and showed me love,

01:03:10.604 --> 01:03:12.574
and told me to...

01:03:12.608 --> 01:03:16.683
lead when others
would only follow.

01:03:21.827 --> 01:03:24.598
Your grandfather, James Walker,
died in his sleep.

01:03:24.632 --> 01:03:28.239
A man put a gun to his head
and shot him while he dreamed.

01:03:28.273 --> 01:03:30.243
I tell you this...

01:03:30.277 --> 01:03:33.249
so you will understand
some of the reasons

01:03:33.283 --> 01:03:38.093
for my actions, and...

01:03:38.126 --> 01:03:39.830
...and the actions of others.

01:03:42.802 --> 01:03:45.607
You are
a strong one, Ivy.

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:47.678
You lead when
others would follow.

01:03:47.712 --> 01:03:50.852
You see light when
there is only darkness.

01:03:56.562 --> 01:03:58.599
I trust you.

01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:04.611
I trust you
among all others.

01:04:07.718 --> 01:04:10.590
Thank you, Father.

01:04:10.623 --> 01:04:14.832
Ivy, do you know
where you are?

01:04:14.867 --> 01:04:17.704
At the old shed
that is not to be used.

01:04:19.877 --> 01:04:21.746
Yeah.

01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:28.626
Ivy.
Yes, Father?

01:04:28.659 --> 01:04:31.732
Do your very best
not to scream.

01:04:34.238 --> 01:04:36.375
(door unlocking)

01:04:36.409 --> 01:04:38.713
(door opening)

01:04:38.746 --> 01:04:40.851
What?

01:05:12.247 --> 01:05:15.820
I am leaving to
fetch you medicines.

01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:22.001
I had a difficult
time getting away.

01:05:22.034 --> 01:05:26.809
What is it?

01:05:26.842 --> 01:05:28.213
(Walker sighs)

01:05:31.954 --> 01:05:34.491
Ivy...

01:05:34.525 --> 01:05:37.831
...has asked...

01:05:37.864 --> 01:05:40.837
...to go to the towns...

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:44.245
...for medicines.

01:05:45.313 --> 01:05:47.918
(sniffling)

01:05:51.392 --> 01:05:54.398
(footsteps approaching)

01:07:23.609 --> 01:07:25.480
Christop.

01:07:30.657 --> 01:07:34.565
Christop... you
needn't be scared.

01:07:34.598 --> 01:07:37.504
We have the magic rocks.

01:07:37.537 --> 01:07:40.008
They will keep us safe.

01:07:41.512 --> 01:07:45.187
Why have we not heard
of these rocks before?

01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:49.595
Christop, please.
Do not leave us.

01:07:49.628 --> 01:07:53.203
There is nothing to fear.

01:07:53.236 --> 01:07:56.475
Then why do you wear the cloak
of the safe color?

01:07:56.509 --> 01:07:59.448
We will light torches.

01:07:59.481 --> 01:08:02.454
It will be safe.

01:08:02.487 --> 01:08:05.058
It is forbidden.

01:08:05.827 --> 01:08:07.697
(Finton) Christop.

01:08:55.259 --> 01:08:59.801
Ivy... there's something
in these woods.

01:09:01.772 --> 01:09:04.109
It turns my stomach to rot.

01:09:11.792 --> 01:09:13.929
You will be safe.

01:09:13.962 --> 01:09:17.470
They will not harm you,
because you cannot see.

01:09:17.504 --> 01:09:20.209
They will take pity on you,
the way they took pity on Noah

01:09:20.242 --> 01:09:25.620
when-when he ventured
in the woods.

01:09:25.653 --> 01:09:28.859
They will kill me, Ivy.

01:09:29.327 --> 01:09:31.832
I cannot stay.

01:09:37.844 --> 01:09:40.550
You're better in these
woods than most boys.

01:09:40.582 --> 01:09:44.858
Anyone would say so.
It is my burden, Finton.

01:09:46.862 --> 01:09:48.966
You may go.
Come with me.

01:10:17.323 --> 01:10:19.661
(Walker) Do your very
best not to scream.

01:10:19.695 --> 01:10:21.965
(door opens)

01:10:34.457 --> 01:10:36.729
(Ivy) There's an odd smell.

01:10:41.137 --> 01:10:43.743
(Walker) It is ahead of you.

01:10:45.713 --> 01:10:48.452
(Ivy) What is it?

01:10:48.485 --> 01:10:52.125
(Walker) I cannot explain
in words.

01:10:52.159 --> 01:10:54.931
It is just a few steps.

01:11:04.918 --> 01:11:08.392
(screams)
Those We Don't Speak Of!

01:11:08.425 --> 01:11:12.834
Do not be frightened.

01:11:12.867 --> 01:11:15.907
It is only farce.

01:11:17.711 --> 01:11:21.050
Do not be frightened.

01:11:32.907 --> 01:11:36.481
There did exist
rumors of...

01:11:36.514 --> 01:11:38.886
creatures in these woods.

01:11:38.919 --> 01:11:43.495
It is in one of the history
books I used to teach in
the towns.

01:11:43.528 --> 01:11:47.971
The screams
from the woods?

01:11:48.004 --> 01:11:50.710
We created those sounds.

01:11:51.879 --> 01:11:54.517
The Ceremony of Meat?

01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:58.959
We remove it ourselves.
An elder is always assigned.

01:11:58.993 --> 01:12:02.265
The drills -
they are farce, too?

01:12:02.299 --> 01:12:05.740
We did not want anyone
to go to the towns, Ivy.

01:12:08.746 --> 01:12:11.885
What about the animals -

01:12:11.919 --> 01:12:15.291
the skinned ones? Are the elders
responsible for that, too?

01:12:15.325 --> 01:12:17.997
I believe one of the elders
is responsible.

01:12:18.031 --> 01:12:20.803
It will not happen again.

01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:24.309
There is no one in this village
who has not lost someone
irreplaceable,

01:12:24.344 --> 01:12:26.815
who has not felt
loss so deeply

01:12:26.849 --> 01:12:31.090
that they questioned the very
merit of living at all.

01:12:31.123 --> 01:12:34.865
It is a darkness I wished...

01:12:34.898 --> 01:12:37.035
...you would never know.

01:12:39.239 --> 01:12:41.343
Forgive us our
silly lies, Ivy.

01:12:41.378 --> 01:12:45.151
They were not
meant to harm.

01:12:52.901 --> 01:12:57.844
I am... sad
for you, Papa.

01:12:59.948 --> 01:13:02.085
For all the elders.

01:13:12.139 --> 01:13:14.911
On this paper
has been written

01:13:14.945 --> 01:13:17.249
a tool of medicine.

01:13:17.282 --> 01:13:19.955
It is common in the towns.
You will go...

01:13:19.988 --> 01:13:23.428
...with two escorts.

01:13:23.462 --> 01:13:26.133
Follow the sounds
of the stream.

01:13:26.167 --> 01:13:29.339
A half day's journey will
bring you to a hidden road.

01:13:29.373 --> 01:13:32.279
At this hidden road,
the two escorts will wait

01:13:32.312 --> 01:13:37.924
as you continue. You alone
will follow the road...

01:13:39.359 --> 01:13:43.034
...and leave Covington Woods.

01:13:43.067 --> 01:13:47.309
You are to tell no one
in the towns where we are...

01:13:47.342 --> 01:13:50.248
...and return with haste.

01:13:52.887 --> 01:13:55.960
I cannot come with you.

01:13:59.399 --> 01:14:03.041
You gave your heart
to this boy.

01:14:03.074 --> 01:14:06.247
He is in need.

01:14:08.217 --> 01:14:12.059
Are you ready to
take this burden,

01:14:12.092 --> 01:14:16.233
which, by right,
is yours and yours alone?

01:14:25.085 --> 01:14:30.061
I am making fresh cloths
for Lucius. He needs them.

01:14:30.095 --> 01:14:32.165
Alice, I've
sent for help.

01:14:37.275 --> 01:14:40.949
I've sent Ivy
to the towns.

01:14:42.219 --> 01:14:46.160
You cannot.

01:14:46.193 --> 01:14:49.133
It is all that
I can give you.

01:14:57.082 --> 01:15:00.255
It is all that
I can give you.

01:15:03.995 --> 01:15:06.200
I accept.

01:15:25.371 --> 01:15:28.111
What have you done?

01:15:28.144 --> 01:15:32.185
He is the victim
of a crime.

01:15:32.219 --> 01:15:35.926
We have agreed never
to go back. Never!

01:15:35.959 --> 01:15:38.397
What was the purpose
of our leaving?

01:15:38.431 --> 01:15:41.303
Let us not forget
it was out of hope

01:15:41.337 --> 01:15:43.407
of something good
and right.

01:15:43.441 --> 01:15:46.046
You should not have made
decisions without us.

01:15:46.079 --> 01:15:50.321
You have gone too far.
I'm guilty, Robert!

01:15:50.355 --> 01:15:52.125
I made a decision
of the heart!

01:15:52.159 --> 01:15:54.564
I cannot look into
another's eyes

01:15:54.597 --> 01:15:57.335
and see the same look
I see in August's

01:15:57.369 --> 01:16:00.241
without justification!

01:16:00.275 --> 01:16:03.347
It is too painful.
I cannot bear it!

01:16:03.381 --> 01:16:07.121
You have jeopardized
everything we've made.

01:16:10.328 --> 01:16:14.203
Who do you think will continue
this place, this life?

01:16:16.307 --> 01:16:20.348
Do you plan to
live forever?

01:16:20.381 --> 01:16:23.287
It is in them that
our future lies.

01:16:23.321 --> 01:16:25.358
It is in Ivy and Lucius
that this...

01:16:25.391 --> 01:16:28.464
this way of life
will continue.

01:16:28.497 --> 01:16:30.368
Yes, I have risked!

01:16:30.401 --> 01:16:33.374
I hope I am always able
to risk everything

01:16:33.407 --> 01:16:36.012
for the just
and right cause.

01:16:39.185 --> 01:16:41.423
If we did not make
this decision,

01:16:41.457 --> 01:16:44.396
we could never again
call ourselves innocent.

01:16:44.429 --> 01:16:48.070
And that, in the end, is what
we have protected here,

01:16:48.103 --> 01:16:50.508
innocence!

01:16:50.541 --> 01:16:53.381
That I'm not
ready to give up.

01:16:59.894 --> 01:17:02.399
Let her go.

01:17:04.503 --> 01:17:07.241
If it ends, it ends.

01:17:10.247 --> 01:17:12.385
We can move towards hope.

01:17:12.419 --> 01:17:15.591
It's what's beautiful
about this place.

01:17:15.625 --> 01:17:18.196
We must not run
from heartache.

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.271
You know, my brother
was slain in the towns.

01:17:22.305 --> 01:17:24.343
The rest of my
family died here.

01:17:24.376 --> 01:17:27.515
Heartache is a part
of life. We know that now.

01:17:27.549 --> 01:17:31.590
Ivy's running toward hope.
Let her run.

01:17:31.623 --> 01:17:36.668
If this place is worthy, she'll
be successful in her quest.

01:17:38.404 --> 01:17:40.876
How could you
have sent her?

01:17:40.909 --> 01:17:44.182
She's blind.

01:17:44.215 --> 01:17:47.321
She's more capable than
most in this village...

01:17:49.225 --> 01:17:53.333
...and she is led by love.

01:17:53.367 --> 01:17:56.540
The world moves for love.

01:17:59.245 --> 01:18:02.619
It kneels before it in awe.

01:18:13.474 --> 01:18:17.348
* All the world to see

01:18:17.381 --> 01:18:21.590
* Time to look about and know

01:18:21.623 --> 01:18:25.698
* How the shadows come and go

01:18:25.732 --> 01:18:30.274
* How the breeze stirs the trees

01:18:30.307 --> 01:18:34.048
* How the blossoms grow

01:18:34.082 --> 01:18:38.390
* Sleep, baby, sleep

01:18:38.423 --> 01:18:41.964
* Sleep, gently, sleep...

01:19:10.555 --> 01:19:12.491
(screams)

01:19:29.894 --> 01:19:32.098
(whimpering)

01:19:57.181 --> 01:19:59.820
(grunting)

01:20:24.803 --> 01:20:26.740
(gasping)

01:20:30.849 --> 01:20:32.819
(continues gasping)

01:20:57.970 --> 01:21:02.711
(Walker) There did exist rumors
of creatures in these woods.

01:21:02.745 --> 01:21:04.682
It is in one of the
history books I used to
teach in the towns.

01:21:04.715 --> 01:21:06.787
(grunts)

01:21:08.623 --> 01:21:10.727
(whimpering)

01:21:33.206 --> 01:21:35.277
(gasps)

01:21:38.450 --> 01:21:40.687
(rustling)

01:22:14.022 --> 01:22:15.925
(rustling)

01:22:30.054 --> 01:22:32.291
(whimpering)

01:22:35.564 --> 01:22:37.801
(rustling)

01:22:37.834 --> 01:22:39.838
(whimpering)

01:23:14.975 --> 01:23:16.979
(growl)

01:23:21.156 --> 01:23:22.924
(growl)

01:23:31.008 --> 01:23:35.050
It is not real.
It is not real.

01:23:37.054 --> 01:23:39.024
(gasping)

01:23:58.096 --> 01:23:59.898
(growls)

01:24:19.003 --> 01:24:21.442
(roars)

01:24:39.245 --> 01:24:41.382
(screaming)

01:24:42.818 --> 01:24:44.722
(roaring)

01:24:57.681 --> 01:24:59.818
(roars)

01:24:59.852 --> 01:25:02.089
(screaming)

01:25:06.299 --> 01:25:08.703
(gasping)

01:26:02.544 --> 01:26:04.748
(roaring)

01:26:15.370 --> 01:26:17.240
(woman) Noah?

01:26:19.912 --> 01:26:23.319
Oh, my God.
What is this?
What is this?

01:26:23.352 --> 01:26:25.590
(woman) Where is he?

01:26:29.698 --> 01:26:32.738
(Robert) He found one of
the suits we kept under
the floorboards.

01:26:32.771 --> 01:26:34.842
(woman sobbing) Oh, no.

01:26:34.875 --> 01:26:38.550
Oh, God, the animals.

01:26:39.652 --> 01:26:41.789
(wind blowing)

01:26:44.995 --> 01:26:47.668
(moaning)

01:26:52.611 --> 01:26:54.948
(whimpering)

01:27:04.768 --> 01:27:07.608
(whimpering)

01:27:49.958 --> 01:27:52.029
(gasps)

01:28:05.824 --> 01:28:09.130
(Walker) His will to live
is very strong.

01:28:50.847 --> 01:28:55.055
(Walker) A half day's
journey will bring you
to a hidden road.

01:28:55.088 --> 01:28:59.163
You alone will
follow the road...

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:05.208
...and leave Covington Woods.

01:29:05.242 --> 01:29:09.016
You are to tell no one
in the towns where we are...

01:29:10.085 --> 01:29:12.858
...and return with haste.

01:29:56.377 --> 01:29:58.314
(yelps)

01:30:18.422 --> 01:30:20.994
(grunting)

01:31:19.276 --> 01:31:23.251
(Mrs. Clack) My sister did not
live past her 23rd birthday.

01:31:23.284 --> 01:31:27.126
A group of men
raped and killed her.

01:31:27.159 --> 01:31:31.100
They stuffed her
in a Dumpster,

01:31:31.134 --> 01:31:35.509
three blocks from
our apartment.

01:31:35.543 --> 01:31:39.450
(August) My brother worked in
an emergency room downtown.

01:31:39.483 --> 01:31:44.026
A drug addict came in
with a wound to his ribs.

01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:47.399
My brother tried
to dress the wound.

01:31:47.432 --> 01:31:50.505
He pulled a gun
from his jacket...

01:31:50.539 --> 01:31:54.981
...then he shot my brother
through his left eye.

01:31:55.014 --> 01:31:58.421
(Alice) My husband, Michael,
left for the supermarket

01:31:58.454 --> 01:32:01.427
at a quarter past nine
in the morning.

01:32:01.460 --> 01:32:06.270
He was found with
no money and no clothes

01:32:06.304 --> 01:32:09.443
in the East River,
three days later.

01:32:09.476 --> 01:32:13.518
(Walker) My father was shot
by a business partner,

01:32:13.552 --> 01:32:17.192
who then hanged himself
in my father's closet.

01:32:17.226 --> 01:32:21.033
They had argued over money.

01:32:21.066 --> 01:32:25.475
I am a professor.
I teach American History

01:32:25.508 --> 01:32:28.448
at the University of
Pennsylvania.

01:32:28.481 --> 01:32:32.088
I have an idea...

01:32:32.122 --> 01:32:35.596
...that I would like
to talk to you about.

01:32:35.629 --> 01:32:38.401
(siren blaring)
Mile 27 - there's a girl.

01:32:38.434 --> 01:32:40.338
I'm gonna check it out.

01:32:40.372 --> 01:32:42.977
(man on radio) Be careful.

01:32:45.114 --> 01:32:47.352
(siren blaring)

01:33:03.518 --> 01:33:06.490
You're not allowed
to go in there.

01:33:06.524 --> 01:33:09.129
Please return
to your vehicle.

01:33:09.162 --> 01:33:14.306
What was that noise?

01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:16.811
What are you doing
out here?

01:33:16.845 --> 01:33:22.522
How'd you get here?
Are you from the towns?

01:33:22.556 --> 01:33:25.462
Uh, where are you from?

01:33:29.236 --> 01:33:31.240
The woods.

01:33:35.248 --> 01:33:39.857
You came from the woods?

01:33:39.891 --> 01:33:43.130
In there?

01:33:43.163 --> 01:33:46.537
Will you help me?

01:33:46.570 --> 01:33:50.545
I need to find
a doctor of medicine.

01:33:50.578 --> 01:33:53.117
I must find these things.
We must make haste.

01:33:53.150 --> 01:33:56.557
Listen, ma'am.

01:33:56.590 --> 01:33:58.428
I'm just supposed to...

01:34:16.397 --> 01:34:18.468
Is someone hurt?

01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:24.413
Please, sir.
We must make haste.

01:34:29.322 --> 01:34:31.193
Well, you-you
live in there?

01:34:31.226 --> 01:34:33.364
I do, sir.

01:34:41.614 --> 01:34:44.553
(man on walkie-talkie) Breaker.

01:34:46.356 --> 01:34:48.661
What is your name?
Kevin.

01:34:48.695 --> 01:34:50.632
Kevin.

01:34:52.368 --> 01:34:55.408
You have kindness
in your voice.

01:34:56.410 --> 01:34:59.315
I did not expect that.

01:35:04.994 --> 01:35:07.031
We have guard shacks
every ten miles

01:35:07.065 --> 01:35:08.735
around the perimeter
of the preserve.

01:35:08.769 --> 01:35:11.540
We keep medical supplies there
in case of animal bites

01:35:11.574 --> 01:35:14.045
or related injuries.

01:35:14.079 --> 01:35:16.416
You can find the things
written on the paper?

01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:22.061
Uh... you have
to wait here.

01:35:22.095 --> 01:35:23.999
Please, sir.

01:35:24.032 --> 01:35:26.670
Please... take
this as payment.

01:35:33.450 --> 01:35:36.023
Wait, y-you're not...

01:35:36.056 --> 01:35:38.694
You're not tricking me,
are you?

01:35:38.728 --> 01:35:40.966
I do not understand.

01:35:43.704 --> 01:35:46.476
What's your name?

01:35:46.510 --> 01:35:48.714
Ivy.

01:35:50.151 --> 01:35:52.990
Ivy Elizabeth Walker.

01:35:55.427 --> 01:35:57.666
(man on radio) There's
an overturned trailer

01:35:57.699 --> 01:36:00.371
causing a one-hour delay
at the Lincoln Tunnel.

01:36:00.404 --> 01:36:06.016
The body of seven-year-old
Katrina Nelson was found
today...

01:36:06.049 --> 01:36:08.855
(chiming)

01:36:08.889 --> 01:36:13.063
It's 35 degrees outside...

01:36:13.097 --> 01:36:15.836
What's with the girl? I tried
calling you back on the walkie.

01:36:15.869 --> 01:36:18.173
You didn't answer.
Oh, it was just
some teenagers.

01:36:18.207 --> 01:36:21.179
They were lost.

01:36:21.213 --> 01:36:23.517
Can I give you
some advice?

01:36:23.550 --> 01:36:27.025
Don't get into conversations.
You start talkin',

01:36:27.058 --> 01:36:30.031
you start gettin' into how
some estate is payin' all of us,

01:36:30.064 --> 01:36:33.537
and no one's allowed to go in
there and disturb the animal
sanctuary.

01:36:33.570 --> 01:36:35.775
People's interest
gets piqued.

01:36:35.809 --> 01:36:38.147
It's a really
easy gig, Kevin.

01:36:38.180 --> 01:36:42.588
Maintain and protect
the border. That's it.

01:36:42.622 --> 01:36:45.494
A few years ago, it got
out in the papers

01:36:45.527 --> 01:36:47.065
that some government guys
had been paid off

01:36:47.098 --> 01:36:50.772
to keep plane routes from
flying over this place.

01:36:50.805 --> 01:36:53.177
That was a very
stressful time for me.

01:36:53.210 --> 01:36:55.614
Don't cause me
any troubles.

01:36:55.648 --> 01:36:57.853
Do not get
into conversations.

01:37:49.255 --> 01:37:51.726
Hey, Jay, where's
the maintenance ladder?

01:37:54.399 --> 01:37:57.238
I n-need to fix a sign.

01:37:58.673 --> 01:38:00.644
It's in the back.

01:38:45.001 --> 01:38:47.705
(chiming)

01:39:10.051 --> 01:39:12.855
Ivy has returned with
medicines from the towns.

01:39:12.888 --> 01:39:15.894
She was attacked by
a creature and killed it.

01:39:18.267 --> 01:39:20.337
(sobbing)

01:39:27.351 --> 01:39:31.293
Noah. Oh, God.

01:39:31.326 --> 01:39:36.469
We will find him.

01:39:36.503 --> 01:39:38.507
We will give him...

01:39:40.477 --> 01:39:42.848
...a proper burial.

01:39:45.321 --> 01:39:47.491
We will tell the others...

01:39:51.066 --> 01:39:53.570
...he was killed
by the creatures.

01:39:58.080 --> 01:40:01.386
Your son has made
our stories real.

01:40:05.394 --> 01:40:08.433
Noah has given us a chance
to continue this place...

01:40:12.908 --> 01:40:15.114
...if that is something...

01:40:18.453 --> 01:40:20.957
...we still wish for.

01:41:32.768 --> 01:41:35.207
I'm back, Lucius.
