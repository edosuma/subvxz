WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:03.571
We are Nadja and Laszlo,
the human music group.

00:03.604 --> 00:05.273
She's a superb lyricist.

00:05.373 --> 00:07.741
* We're feeling horny
For love *

00:07.775 --> 00:10.944
* We're feeling horny
For love *

00:11.045 --> 00:13.181
(up-tempo music plays)

00:14.748 --> 00:15.749
VOCALISTS: Hey!

00:22.856 --> 00:25.493
"My Dick Sucks"
put him on the map.

00:25.526 --> 00:26.694
(exhales sharply)

00:26.727 --> 00:29.330
The Somebody Suck Me
Competition?

00:29.363 --> 00:30.898
Well, that proved that he could
infiltrate pop culture

00:30.931 --> 00:32.666
like that.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.336
Now, what's the next big project
that's gonna elevate Dave

00:35.369 --> 00:38.539
to become an icon-level artist?

00:38.572 --> 00:41.575
Well, lucky for you guys,
he's working on that right now.

00:41.609 --> 00:44.512
And maybe it can be
with Katonah Records.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.847
DAVE:
And just to piggyback
off Mike-- thank you--

00:46.880 --> 00:48.682
I'm working on my next album
right now.

00:48.716 --> 00:51.585
I really think it's gonna be,
like, the zenith of musicality.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.854
-JONATHAN: Hmm.
-It's called Penith.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.456
(laughter)

00:57.125 --> 00:59.860
But do you guys actually get it?

00:59.893 --> 01:01.529
-Like, fully?
-MIKE: They get it.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.197
What does "penith" mean to you?

01:03.231 --> 01:04.765
I don't mean to harp,
but I feel like...

01:04.798 --> 01:06.867
-They get it. He gets it.
-All I know is,

01:06.900 --> 01:10.271
somebody wants to get
their dick sucked right now.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.773
-(quietly): What?
-You get that?

01:12.806 --> 01:14.575
That we want to sign you?

01:14.608 --> 01:16.710
Oh! Dope.

01:16.744 --> 01:19.713
I can talk like this because
this is a creative meeting.

01:19.747 --> 01:22.916
Thus, HR can't get mad
at me again. (laughs)

01:22.950 --> 01:26.220
-Okay.
-I haven't worked in corporate
America for a while, but...

01:26.254 --> 01:29.823
Hey, Dave. Have you ever
been sucked like this?

01:33.827 --> 01:35.062
Hmm.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.764
A record deal.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.067
-I do love to get sucked.
-(laughter)

01:40.100 --> 01:42.236
MIKE:
He does.

01:42.270 --> 01:45.439
But this feels like I'm being
fucked up my ass.

01:45.473 --> 01:48.476
Or how I'd imagine
it feels like.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.780
So...
(exhaling sharply)

01:57.017 --> 01:59.086
MIKE:
Ugh. Hmm...

01:59.119 --> 02:03.424
I have a slack jaw,
and a underbite.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.427
And that's why I could only bite
that amount of it.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.796
Come back with something better,

02:08.829 --> 02:11.999
or, hey, Denzel Washington will
walk right out your front door.

02:12.032 --> 02:13.100
Hmm.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.802
Me.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.639
I act as well.

02:22.009 --> 02:24.144
-Do you have another copy?
-* Hi, I'm Dave *

02:24.178 --> 02:26.180
-* I'm Lil Dicky *
-* Hi, I'm Dave *

02:26.214 --> 02:27.781
-* Who's Dave? *
-* Hi, I'm Dave. *

02:27.815 --> 02:30.984
I say this
with the utmost sincerity,

02:31.018 --> 02:32.853
I am the next Kanye West.

02:33.854 --> 02:38.125
Except... I'm white.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.793
-Oh.
-It's a shitty reality,

02:39.827 --> 02:41.795
but white rappers sell more.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.464
Records, ticket sales.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.966
It's just, it sucks,
but it's the cold, hard truth.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.468
I hate that it's true,
by the way.

02:47.501 --> 02:51.539
So, I'm actually more like
Eminem, to the consumer.

02:51.572 --> 02:52.973
The highest selling rapper

02:53.006 --> 02:54.475
-of all time.
-MIKE: Drake is.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.477
-What?
-Drake.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.646
Drake is the highest selling
rap-- He surpassed him.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.314
-When?
-This year.

03:00.348 --> 03:01.882
DAVE:
Well, I mean, he's Jewish,
so whatever.

03:01.915 --> 03:04.652
I'm like Eminem,
except I'm wholesome.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.320
And, like, sweet.

03:06.354 --> 03:08.656
I'm, like, a sweet man.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.824
Any 12-year-old girl in America
is gonna look at me and be like,

03:10.858 --> 03:12.826
-"Oh, my God,
I could marry that guy."
-Oh.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.529
DAVE:
And by the way, I wouldn't
marry a 12-year-old girl.

03:15.563 --> 03:16.997
I'm just saying,
they will want to marry me.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.732
-(Kelsey clears throat)
-Mentally.

03:18.766 --> 03:20.668
They'll never have a chance
because I'm not a pedophile.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.336
Keep going. Just keep going.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.037
DAVE:
And that brings me
to my next point.

03:24.071 --> 03:26.073
My physicality.

03:26.106 --> 03:28.208
I'm just, like,
I read all the comments,

03:28.242 --> 03:29.843
and I-I see everything,
and it didn't--

03:29.877 --> 03:31.679
-It was not always this way.
-No.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.046
DAVE:
If you look at my face now,

03:33.080 --> 03:34.848
you'd never realize
what I used to look like.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.750
When I as a kid,
my face was haunted.

03:36.784 --> 03:40.521
People used to scream at me.

03:40.554 --> 03:43.457
-Oh.
-And you what's gonna
end up happening, right?

03:45.058 --> 03:48.028
The Zayn effect.
Like, who is Zayn?

03:48.061 --> 03:51.031
-Zayn Malik?
-I don't even know what
that guy's music sounds like,

03:51.064 --> 03:53.233
but it doesn't even matter,
he's so hot.

03:53.267 --> 03:54.602
-Yeah. He's hot.
-TRAVIS: It's pretty good.

03:54.635 --> 03:55.703
-He's really hot.
-Yeah.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.037
DAVE:
Anyways, you put all three

03:57.070 --> 04:00.107
of those things together
and you have Lil Dicky.

04:00.140 --> 04:02.943
I'm Dave Burd.
I'm also a hopeless romantic.

04:02.976 --> 04:05.713
I just learned you're supposed
to call Hispanic people La-tinx.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.882
And I love chicken fingers
with a side of honey mu-stard.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.618
Let's make a billion dollars.
Thank you.

04:10.651 --> 04:11.885
(laughter, applause)

04:11.919 --> 04:13.421
Wow.

04:15.423 --> 04:20.127
We think you have the potential
to be the next Lonely Island.

04:21.329 --> 04:22.596
Yeah.

04:22.630 --> 04:25.098
Is my music a joke to you guys?

04:25.132 --> 04:26.567
Yeah, it's so funny.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.235
-Hilarious.
-DAVE: I am one

04:28.268 --> 04:30.638
of the five best rappers alive,
probably.

04:30.671 --> 04:32.640
-Mm-mm.
-Well.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.775
Well, I guess I'm not better
than Nas, or, like,

04:34.808 --> 04:36.744
-Lil Wayne. Yeah.
-Lil Wayne.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.145
-Young Thug, either.
-MIKE: No.

04:38.178 --> 04:40.080
I have to, like, write it all--
I-I don't know.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.915
But I'm saying it's, like, ver--
It's not-- Like, Lonely Island,

04:41.949 --> 04:43.617
-I mean...
-I'm-I'm so sorry. I didn't...

04:43.651 --> 04:45.653
I didn't mean to get off
on the wrong foot.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.588
Um, what else
are you working on?

04:47.621 --> 04:49.923
Well, I'm working on an album.

04:49.957 --> 04:50.958
That's great.

04:51.992 --> 04:53.627
It's called Penith.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.295
(laughter)

04:56.497 --> 04:58.165
Penith?

04:58.198 --> 04:59.800
(laughter)

05:01.469 --> 05:04.004
-(loud laughter)
-He's just so funny. Penith?

05:04.037 --> 05:06.774
-They got it.
-(stammers) No. Do you even know
what "zenith" means?

05:06.807 --> 05:09.109
-Do you even know, do you even
know what you're laughing at?
-KELSEY: You said "penith."

05:09.142 --> 05:10.511
Okay. You don't even know--

05:10.544 --> 05:12.813
You guys don't even know
what you're laughing at.

05:12.846 --> 05:13.847
(laughter echoes)

05:14.982 --> 05:16.450
PAM:
Dave,

05:16.484 --> 05:17.951
I'm just gonna cut
to the chase here.

05:17.985 --> 05:22.623
You're hilarious,
but we are a record label.

05:22.656 --> 05:25.526
We make music,
and your music is what we want.

05:25.559 --> 05:28.362
(laughs):
Your rapping is amazing.

05:28.396 --> 05:30.364
-Yeah. It's good, right?
-Yeah.

05:30.398 --> 05:33.133
-Yeah, we love it.
-I'm an incredible rapper.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.035
-We concur.
-I think so.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.170
-Thanks.
-Question is,

05:37.204 --> 05:39.139
are you willing
to settle for that?

05:39.172 --> 05:41.975
-How far do you want to go?
-All right, cut the shit.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.377
If I ever sign with a label,

05:43.411 --> 05:45.379
it would only be
to use them as a machine.

05:45.413 --> 05:48.048
Like, I would never want you
guys touching the creative.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.483
There's no idea
you could give me

05:49.517 --> 05:51.652
that I wouldn't already know
myself better.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.854
Oh, absolutely. We're coming in
just as partners.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.489
Nothing creative.
That's all you.

05:55.523 --> 05:56.690
EXECUTIVE:
Yeah, you do your thing.

05:56.724 --> 06:00.193
Just think of us as planets
around your sun.

06:00.227 --> 06:03.497
Well, I believe in simulation
theory right now, so that's...

06:03.531 --> 06:07.668
-Mm-hmm.
-Tell me, in actuality,
how you'd add value.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.903
Have you ever heard
of New Music Fridays on Spotify?

06:09.937 --> 06:11.905
No.

06:11.939 --> 06:14.007
-Of course I've heard of it.
Everyone's...
-Yeah. Yeah.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.343
That's where we come in. That's
our job, the boring stuff,

06:16.376 --> 06:17.711
to put you on that front page.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.580
That would be useful.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.682
I mean, yeah. That-That's
what you need them for.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.717
A label is about
cross-pollination.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.553
It's about collaboration.

06:25.586 --> 06:28.522
Right. And you haven't worked
with any other rappers, right?

06:28.556 --> 06:31.592
I mean, it's, like, not easy
to just work with other rappers.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.594
I'm not, like,
best friends with these guys.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.429
-Yeah, but we can
make it easy for you.
-JIM: Mm-hmm.

06:35.463 --> 06:38.198
We open doors, dude.
That's what we do here.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.400
We'll be your whores,
you leverage that.

06:40.434 --> 06:41.702
-My whores?
-(Pam chuckles)

06:41.735 --> 06:43.370
-Whores.
-For you.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.405
It's a metaphorical whore, like,

06:45.439 --> 06:47.441
-I don't mean that romantically
in any way.
-Yeah, absolutely.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.109
I don't think
she took it sexistly.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.611
And I-I didn't take it
heterosexistly.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.045
I've seen a lot of male whores.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.748
And you won't even attempt
to put a finger

06:54.782 --> 06:57.551
-on the creative in any way?
-No.
-Mm-mm.

06:57.585 --> 06:58.886
-Yeah.
-PAM (chuckles): Yeah.
-JIM: That being said,

06:58.919 --> 07:01.421
I wouldn't mind setting you up
with Benny Blanco.

07:01.455 --> 07:03.757
He's a superproducer pal
of ours.

07:03.791 --> 07:07.895
Uh, every pop hit you see
on Billboard, that's Benny.

07:07.928 --> 07:11.264
-I mean, this guy
is an out-and-out genius.
-(imitating buzzer sound)

07:11.298 --> 07:12.733
What are you doing? Sit down.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.468
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

07:14.502 --> 07:17.070
Not-on-the-same-page alert going
off right now, guys. Sorry.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.072
-What's the issue?
-I don't make pop music.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.741
I'm a rapper. I hate pop music.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.576
Why would I want to work
with a pop producer?

07:22.610 --> 07:25.579
Oh, well, Benny doesn't just
work with pop singers.

07:25.613 --> 07:28.115
He also works with rappers.
He actually just

07:28.148 --> 07:29.583
-worked on a song with Swae Lee.
-And...

07:29.617 --> 07:31.418
-You like Swae Lee?
-He just did Kanye.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.820
-PAM: Yeah.
-Oh, he works with Kanye?

07:32.853 --> 07:34.588
-JIM: Mm-hmm.
-Sign me up. I'll do anything

07:34.622 --> 07:35.989
-this man says
if he worked with Kanye.
-MIKE: Yes.

07:36.023 --> 07:37.958
-Cool.
-DAVE: You know, guys,

07:37.991 --> 07:39.459
in the beginning
of this meeting,

07:39.493 --> 07:41.261
I was actually
considering taking this glass

07:41.294 --> 07:42.663
and just hurling it
through the window.

07:42.696 --> 07:43.931
Why would you tell them that?
That's...

07:43.964 --> 07:45.098
Just to set the tone.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.767
But now,

07:46.800 --> 07:49.202
-you have me listening.
-We will take that meeting.

07:57.377 --> 08:01.114
(phone clicking)

08:01.148 --> 08:02.482
BENNY:
Somebody lay me down,

08:02.516 --> 08:05.452
pour buttermilk all over me,

08:05.485 --> 08:07.988
dust me in a light dusting
of corn flakes,

08:08.021 --> 08:10.490
front-flip me into a deep fryer,

08:10.524 --> 08:13.794
spit on my asshole,
flip me back around,

08:13.827 --> 08:18.799
shove wasabi up my dickhole,
put fucking sashimi all over me,

08:18.832 --> 08:21.802
light me on fire, gently...
(exhales sharply)

08:21.835 --> 08:25.172
blow me off and lick down
like my body's a maze

08:25.205 --> 08:27.708
till you get to the bottom--
right about there--

08:27.741 --> 08:30.477
and I want you to suck me,
right now.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.312
What's up, man? Benny Blanco.

08:32.345 --> 08:36.650
-(music playing faintly)
-Wow. Great spot.

08:36.684 --> 08:39.186
Nice decor.
Nice ambience in here.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.388
Thanks, man. Oh, shit. I'm just
finishing a session, okay?

08:41.421 --> 08:43.023
-So just like...
-Okay. Wait a minute.
Why is my song...?

08:43.056 --> 08:44.524
-This is my song.
-Dicky.

08:44.558 --> 08:45.726
-(gasps)
-Hey, bro.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.895
-I'm just watching your video.
-Oh...

08:47.928 --> 08:49.396
-It's actually sick, dude.
-Oh, my God.

08:49.429 --> 08:50.998
-Yeah. Hey. How are you?
-(laughs): Hi. Nice to--

08:51.031 --> 08:52.532
-No, I'm so good. Yeah.
-Good, good.

08:52.566 --> 08:54.401
-Um...
-Best I've ever been in my life,
I think.

08:54.434 --> 08:56.536
I got to roll. Um, you're gonna
come tonight, right?

08:56.570 --> 08:57.838
-BENNY: Yeah, of course, man.
-Cool, cool, cool.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.339
Party, tonight.
Come to my house.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.708
-Your house party?
-Yeah. My house party.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.509
-Come on, hang.
-Uh, let me think
about what I had

09:02.542 --> 09:04.511
going on, uh, and I've thought
about it. There's nothing.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.847
-Nothing?
-Yeah, I was actually
just gonna PIBE.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.515
PIBE?

09:08.548 --> 09:10.017
Yeah, PIBE.
Play It By Ear.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.085
It's a new acronym
that I'm trying to...

09:12.119 --> 09:14.021
-get off the ground. Um...
-Okay.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.723
You know, it's got no legs yet.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.925
-Nothing.
-If you pushed it,
who knows, but...

09:17.958 --> 09:19.860
And by the way, my girlfriend
is your biggest fan.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.228
-She's obs-- yeah,
she's obsessed.
-Biggest fan.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.230
Yeah, I never heard that before.
No, I'm just...

09:23.263 --> 09:25.866
Real good idea, man.
You got anything else?

09:25.899 --> 09:28.268
-He's probably gonna remember
this the rest of his life.
-Yeah, uh...

09:28.301 --> 09:30.237
-I, uh, I got to roll...
-Absolutely.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.773
...but, um, yeah, tonight,
you should come.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.875
-I'll come.
-Yeah. Cool, cool. All right.

09:34.908 --> 09:35.943
Yep.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.277
-Cool.
-Yep. We'll see ya.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.578
-Um...
-Peace, man.

09:38.612 --> 09:40.080
Yeah. Biebs out.
I'm just kidding.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.882
I don't actually say that.
I'm pretty normal.

09:41.915 --> 09:42.883
-All right.
-Yeah.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.217
Uh, I'm a normal guy, too,

09:44.251 --> 09:45.552
if you want to chill, or...

09:45.585 --> 09:46.720
JUSTIN:
All right. Bye, Benny!

09:46.754 --> 09:48.388
BENNY:
All right, peace!

09:48.421 --> 09:50.390
You know, you could be
as big as him,

09:50.423 --> 09:52.059
like, very easily.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.394
Y-Yes.
I've-I've always thought that.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.730
I mean, look,
the one problem is,

09:56.764 --> 09:59.232
your music currently sucks,
it's terrible.

09:59.266 --> 10:02.102
Hmm. Okay, I... you know,
I think your music sucks.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.404
You make shitty pop music
for 14-year-old girls.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.574
-Yeah. How many number ones
do you have again?
-Number ones?

10:07.607 --> 10:08.976
Like, what does that even mean?

10:09.009 --> 10:10.811
Like, who can define
what a number one is?

10:10.844 --> 10:12.746
Oh, man, there's a small company
down the street,

10:12.780 --> 10:14.247
it's called Billboard.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.449
How many Billboard number ones
do you have?

10:16.483 --> 10:18.585
I don't check this...

10:18.618 --> 10:20.087
-Yeah.
-...publication, but I,

10:20.120 --> 10:21.822
I know the answer is none.

10:21.855 --> 10:23.991
-Yeah, the answer is none.
-Why? How many do you have?

10:24.024 --> 10:26.760
I stopped counting at, like,
20 or something.

10:26.794 --> 10:27.928
Right.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.262
-Yeah.
-Well...

10:29.296 --> 10:30.998
All right, this is depressing.
Just, like...

10:31.031 --> 10:32.465
play me some of your music.

10:32.499 --> 10:34.134
Like, unreleased music?

10:34.167 --> 10:37.137
(scoffs) Yeah, man. I want to
hear some unreleased music.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.505
You have, like, two songs out.

10:38.538 --> 10:42.275
Okay. This is just one
of the many that I'm...

10:42.309 --> 10:44.344
* My flow is crazy,
I don't spit nothin' basic *

10:44.377 --> 10:46.313
* For example, I could be like,
ain't nobody *

10:46.346 --> 10:48.281
* Fuckin' with Lil Dickey when
they get up on the shit *

10:48.315 --> 10:49.449
* And spit it really ridiculous,
rippin' the shit *

10:49.482 --> 10:50.818
* Like it's never been did... *

10:50.851 --> 10:52.119
All right, stop right here.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.955
Like, why are you, like...
(speaking gibberish)

10:54.988 --> 10:57.024
Like, wh-what
are you trying to prove?

10:57.057 --> 10:59.860
-I'm trying to show that,
like, I'm a great rapper.
-Dude, it's, like,

10:59.893 --> 11:01.661
verbal diarrhea--
I can't... it's, like,

11:01.695 --> 11:04.297
I'm just getting pounded with
information over and over again

11:04.331 --> 11:05.966
-to my head.
-Well, we only listened

11:05.999 --> 11:07.868
-to part of it, but...
-By the way,

11:07.901 --> 11:08.969
who makes these beats?

11:09.002 --> 11:10.370
They're so white.

11:10.403 --> 11:13.140
My friend from overnight camp
makes my beats.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.641
Um, and he's black.

11:14.674 --> 11:15.976
-(door closes)
-ELSIE: Babe.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.010
Oh.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.315
Hi. I need to go get
some coffee.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.650
Do you want anything?

11:23.683 --> 11:25.485
Uh, no, I'm okay.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.054
You want anything, Dave?

11:27.087 --> 11:28.321
No, I'm...

11:28.355 --> 11:29.857
I'm, uh...

11:29.890 --> 11:31.691
I'm good.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.365
I know what you're thinking.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.701
How's a guy like André the Giant
meets Danny DeVito

11:41.735 --> 11:44.004
-pull a girl like this?
-I...

11:44.037 --> 11:45.372
truthfully was wondering that.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.240
My features are so grotesque,

11:47.274 --> 11:50.210
I'm like a science experiment
gone wrong.

11:50.243 --> 11:51.912
And it's just, like, I...

11:51.945 --> 11:53.847
I don't know,
I shot out the other side,

11:53.881 --> 11:55.215
-and now I'm hot.
-Shut up.

11:55.248 --> 11:56.850
I don't know
why you say these things.

11:56.884 --> 11:59.019
-You're not ugly.
-Hmm.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.054
You guys actually
kind of look like brothers.

12:01.088 --> 12:03.523
-That's 'cause
we're both Jewish.
-Jewish.

12:03.556 --> 12:04.892
Right.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.560
(exhaling)

12:07.594 --> 12:10.363
That's right, Justin Bieber

12:10.397 --> 12:12.599
invited me... to...

12:12.632 --> 12:14.534
(grunts)
a party... tonight.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.369
Gonna go.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.872
-Yeah.
-I told you that meeting was
a good idea, Dave.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.373
You sure did. You were right.
When you're right,

12:20.407 --> 12:21.541
-you're right, Mike.
-Yes, I was.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.076
You know what?
I'm gonna go get the good tongs.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.045
You do get the good tongs.
I like when you get them.

12:25.078 --> 12:28.715
I get to meet Justin Bieber
tonight?

12:28.748 --> 12:31.551
-Oh.
-Oh, my God, do you think
the Kardashians will be there?

12:31.584 --> 12:34.221
I don't think I can bring
anybody to this thing.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.556
-What?
-I shouldn't bring somebody.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.258
You can't bring people
to a party?

12:38.291 --> 12:40.093
I'm sure I could,
but I don't know that I can,

12:40.127 --> 12:41.895
and I don't want to, like,
hit him up and ask,

12:41.929 --> 12:43.296
'cause it's the whole,
you know, I don't know

12:43.330 --> 12:45.098
the etiquette,
so I'm gonna play it safe.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.567
The last thing I want to do
is go to a party at Bieber's.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.436
Reverse psychology.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.771
-Okay. I'll consider it.
-GATA: Hey, bro-bro.

12:51.805 --> 12:53.807
-What's up?
-I ain't trying to go,
either, my nigga.

12:53.841 --> 12:55.408
Big facts. That's a--
you're not going.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.577
Okay, can you at least
do me the favor

12:57.610 --> 13:00.280
of giving just
every single detail about him?

13:00.313 --> 13:02.415
-Like, please tell me
exactly what he smells like.
-Okay, hold on,

13:02.449 --> 13:04.151
let me just go back-- eh!

13:04.184 --> 13:05.919
-I'm there. Citrus.
-Oh!

13:05.953 --> 13:07.487
-Smells like citrus.
-Mm.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.489
Jawline chiseled.
It's jutting.

13:09.522 --> 13:10.757
It's, like, he's Tom Cruise-ian.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.259
It's exactly
what you read about.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.627
The ink pops off
this guy's body.

13:14.661 --> 13:16.830
-I mean, he looks like
high-end wallpaper in person.
-Oh, my God.

13:16.864 --> 13:19.266
Bro, who cares
about Justin Bieber?

13:19.299 --> 13:20.767
Everybody on the planet.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.102
You know who I care about?

13:22.135 --> 13:23.971
Benny Blanco.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.506
So, tell me about
the LeBron James of production.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.675
He... he did, uh,
talk about your beats.

13:28.708 --> 13:30.110
You see? Hold on.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.945
Let me...
let me bask in my greatness.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.181
And he said,
"Who made your beats?

13:35.315 --> 13:36.483
"They suck...

13:36.516 --> 13:39.352
-GATA: Ha!
-...and are too white."

13:39.386 --> 13:41.621
I'm telling you what he said.
He said they were too white.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.023
-Oh...
-He said I suck, too, so...

13:43.056 --> 13:45.125
Oh, he said you suck
for not bringing your girlfriend

13:45.158 --> 13:47.460
-to the party of her dreams?
Is that what he said?
-It's a net--

13:47.494 --> 13:48.661
it's, like,
I'm there to network.

13:48.695 --> 13:50.197
I got this meeting from a label.
It's, like...

13:50.230 --> 13:52.665
Actually, I decided I kind of
don't really care about it,

13:52.699 --> 13:54.968
because I have some totally
chill, like, really cool plans

13:55.002 --> 13:56.203
with my friend Elz.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.470
-Whoo!
-We're gonna go see

13:57.504 --> 13:58.872
the Pats-Birds at a bar, so...

13:58.906 --> 14:00.640
You're gonna go watch that
at a bar?

14:00.673 --> 14:02.642
It's nationally televised.
Why would you choose

14:02.675 --> 14:05.378
to surround yourself with
everybody vying for a seat

14:05.412 --> 14:07.147
and the sound coming
all over the place,

14:07.180 --> 14:08.715
no real clarity on, like...

14:08.748 --> 14:11.551
Why are you so passionate about
the least important things?

14:11.584 --> 14:13.820
You know what? I'm sorry.
Take a step back.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.189
I'm used to talking to Justin
a certain way.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.158
I got to re-center myself--
I'm around my old group

14:18.191 --> 14:19.826
of friends-- recalibrate.

14:19.859 --> 14:21.828
Uh, never mind.
Do what you want to do.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.230
Have fun at the sports bar.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.165
All right. These steaks
are almost done, kids.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.733
GATA:
Aw, shit.

14:26.766 --> 14:27.834
I almost forgot.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.402
I got some salmon
over here, bro.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.004
Fresh out the Atlantic.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.539
-Salmon?
-Yeah, salmon, bro.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.541
You had salmon in your backpack?

14:34.574 --> 14:36.409
It's gonna be, like, really...

14:36.443 --> 14:38.045
a dream.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.913
What's up, bro, you gonna cook
this shit for me or not?

14:39.947 --> 14:41.348
I-I cannot do that.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.016
I'm not putting backpack salmon
on my grill.

14:43.050 --> 14:46.019
This shit don't expire
for another couple days, it say.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.055
Gata, okay, I'm sorry, I'm just,
I'm not doing that, all right?

14:48.088 --> 14:49.589
Why don't you guys
come over here,

14:49.622 --> 14:51.891
have some homemade ice tea
from yours truly, okay?

14:54.127 --> 14:56.729
GATA:
What the fuck? Y'all got

14:56.763 --> 14:59.432
-a hole through the table?
-Yeah.

14:59.466 --> 15:01.901
It's, uh... it's for milking.

15:01.935 --> 15:04.437
And we're not happy about it,
are we?

15:04.471 --> 15:06.139
Uh...

15:11.078 --> 15:12.946
(loud cheering, whooping)

15:12.980 --> 15:14.914
Fuck!

15:14.948 --> 15:16.783
Bro, can you believe
that this guy Benny Blanco

15:16.816 --> 15:18.418
says my beats are white?

15:18.451 --> 15:21.121
Tell that to my mom and dad,
you know what I mean?

15:21.154 --> 15:24.257
-Can I ask you something?
-Mm-hmm.

15:24.291 --> 15:27.927
Do you think Dave is gonna be
as big as he thinks he is?

15:28.996 --> 15:31.264
He's either gonna be
the way he says he is

15:31.298 --> 15:33.100
and he's gonna be, like,
the biggest star in the world,

15:33.133 --> 15:35.969
or he's not,
and he's gonna be, you know,

15:36.003 --> 15:39.106
some sad Jewish kid
crying everywhere we go.

15:39.139 --> 15:41.641
-MAN: Touchdown!
-(cheering)

15:43.276 --> 15:45.912
Justin, how do you take
your mind off being an artist?

15:45.945 --> 15:47.914
'Cause, you know, I find...
Oh, me?

15:47.947 --> 15:51.584
I... I hoop,
I grill chicken, guy stuff.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.753
Leo, I would not go
in that bathroom.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.822
Renée Zellweger just,
I think she shit her pants,

15:55.855 --> 15:56.823
to be honest, brother.

15:56.856 --> 15:58.825
Yes, Key & Peele,
it is very common

15:58.858 --> 16:01.094
for hair to go
all the way up a guy's shaft.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.430
I'm surprised
you did not know that.

16:03.463 --> 16:04.998
LeBron, are you on Propecia?

16:05.032 --> 16:06.099
I am.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.300
Ri-Ri!

16:07.334 --> 16:08.968
What's up, girl?
What are you doing?

16:09.002 --> 16:10.437
You want to go
to the Met Gala next year

16:10.470 --> 16:11.604
and dress as wedge salads?

16:11.638 --> 16:13.273
-Emma Stone...
-Beyoncé...

16:13.306 --> 16:16.143
-What's that, Shaq?
-Timothée,
I saw Call Me by Your Name,

16:16.176 --> 16:18.345
and I actually got
a full-on boner in the theater.

16:18.378 --> 16:19.979
And, you know,
I'm not even gay.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.648
I just, it's such good acting.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.316
Really good sexual energy,
brother.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.118
Elon, what is
your ethnic background?

16:25.152 --> 16:26.186
You Korean, man?

16:26.219 --> 16:27.487
Tom Clancy, I don't read,

16:27.520 --> 16:29.022
but, you know, people love ya.

16:29.056 --> 16:30.690
Mr. Chang,
by the end of tonight

16:30.723 --> 16:33.026
I need a commitment
that I can call you P.F.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.628
What do you say?
I'll bet you a plate of lo mein.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.365
Justin, man-to-man,
what's your boner life?

16:38.398 --> 16:39.966
Mr. Spacey...

16:39.999 --> 16:41.834
you should go.

16:41.868 --> 16:44.671
* I am 50 Cent *

16:44.704 --> 16:47.807
* I am 50 Cent, I am 50 Cent *

16:47.840 --> 16:49.642
* Bro *

16:49.676 --> 16:53.046
* I am 50 Cent,
I am 50 Cent... *

16:53.080 --> 16:55.982
BENNY (calls):
Hey, Dave!

16:56.015 --> 16:57.484
Hey!

16:57.517 --> 16:59.986
Somebody lay me down,

17:00.019 --> 17:02.489
sous vide me in my own juices,

17:02.522 --> 17:04.724
light up a hibachi grill,

17:04.757 --> 17:08.061
put a little bit of my breast
into a pepper mill,

17:08.095 --> 17:10.197
pepper me with my own tits,

17:10.230 --> 17:11.564
-and suck me.
-(laughs)

17:11.598 --> 17:13.666
What's up, man?

17:13.700 --> 17:15.068
Hey, man.

17:15.102 --> 17:17.003
I'm gonna come down to you.
Just meet me

17:17.036 --> 17:19.872
behind the fourth
Ping-Pong table.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.008
All right.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.543
BENNY:
Hey, man, nice coat.

17:23.576 --> 17:26.012
I didn't realize you were
in The Temptations.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.014
This house is so cool.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.083
I feel like Bieber
probably kissed women

17:30.117 --> 17:32.051
in every crevice of it.

17:32.085 --> 17:34.053
Dude, this house sucks.
Look at the art.

17:34.087 --> 17:35.388
He doesn't even own it.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.224
Universal pays
for the whole thing.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.558
Whoa. Moving.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.527
Speaking of Universal, how...

17:40.560 --> 17:43.530
I'm trying to decide if I
should sign with a label or not.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.365
Do you have any,
like, advice there?

17:45.398 --> 17:47.367
BENNY:
Look, there are pros and cons.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.036
-It just depends on the artist.
-Well, I'm the artist, man.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.105
I'm obviously asking
for that reason.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.706
Like, I'd love to get
into the minutiae with you.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.209
Yeah, man, I think I saw
a few outlets over there

17:56.243 --> 17:57.710
where we could plug in
some computers

17:57.744 --> 17:59.912
and do a little
PowerPoint presentation.

17:59.946 --> 18:01.714
Should I have brought Justin,
like, a bottle of wine?

18:01.748 --> 18:02.749
I don't know the etiquette.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.050
A bottle of wine?

18:04.083 --> 18:05.585
He's sober,
he's a man of Christ.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.387
Plus, he's not
even gonna be here.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.922
What do you mean he's not
gonna be here? It's his party.

18:09.956 --> 18:11.558
Half the time he doesn't
even come to these things.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.126
Sometimes he just goes out
on a whim

18:13.160 --> 18:16.563
and gets a jet and goes
to Peru or Vegas or something.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.798
And then, sometimes
he doesn't want to come

18:18.831 --> 18:20.233
and get pictures
taken with, like,

18:20.267 --> 18:21.901
nine million people
he doesn't know.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.736
-ELSIE: Babe?
-That's so sad.

18:23.770 --> 18:24.737
Hi.

18:24.771 --> 18:25.905
What do you mean?

18:25.938 --> 18:27.474
-That's gonna be you.
-Hi.

18:27.507 --> 18:28.475
Hey.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.243
-I love this jacket.
-Yeah?

18:30.277 --> 18:32.145
Well, he was giving me shit
for it, but he's got no taste.

18:32.179 --> 18:35.815
Um, there's a bunch of really
pretty girls here.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.083
-Really?
-Yeah.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.085
You know, I'm a taken man.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.420
So I got a girlfriend.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.488
But I, I'll observe, sure.

18:41.521 --> 18:42.922
You have a...?

18:42.955 --> 18:44.657
Why didn't you bring her?

18:44.691 --> 18:46.493
I didn't know, like,
the situation

18:46.526 --> 18:48.127
in terms of,
like, bringing people.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.629
I didn't want to...

18:49.662 --> 18:51.931
hit you and be like,
"Yo, I got to bring friends."

18:51.964 --> 18:53.266
It's, you know,
it's kind of our first, uh,

18:53.300 --> 18:55.602
foray into the R.W.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.103
Real world.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.605
-Do you want to go
to the weed bar?
-Yeah.

18:58.638 --> 18:59.672
All right,
I'll see you in a bit, bud.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.974
I blow gas.

19:04.311 --> 19:07.113
(loud cheering, whooping)

19:07.146 --> 19:08.948
Mmm.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.283
Okay, can we...?

19:10.317 --> 19:11.651
Here's the new plan.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.853
Can we get browned out tonight?

19:13.886 --> 19:15.455
-Yes, ma'am.
-Oh.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.789
Yes!

19:16.823 --> 19:18.024
What do you want?

19:18.057 --> 19:18.958
Uh, surprise me.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.360
Okay.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.829
MAN:
Yo, Belichick.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.831
How you like that shit?

19:24.864 --> 19:26.399
I'm Belichick?

19:27.334 --> 19:29.001
I'm Tom Brady.

19:29.035 --> 19:30.803
Belichick wouldn't
even be in a jersey, so...

19:30.837 --> 19:32.372
Probably more of a hoodie guy.

19:32.405 --> 19:33.973
Yeah, a hoodie,
and he would cut off

19:34.006 --> 19:36.142
the sleeves like a badass.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.177
-So...
-Holy shit.

19:38.211 --> 19:40.380
You actually know about sports?

19:40.413 --> 19:43.650
-Oh, my God,
that's so crazy, right?
-Oh, my God.

19:43.683 --> 19:44.884
-It's-it's insane.
-Yeah.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.152
How not typical of a girl.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.654
No, I know, you know,
normally, like, they'll say,

19:47.687 --> 19:50.323
-like, the pink hat stuff,
you know what I mean?
-Yeah.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.658
-Yeah, yeah, crazy.
-But you, like, totally know
what's up.

19:51.691 --> 19:52.659
Yeah, I totally know what's up.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.826
-This is amazing.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.328
You seem...

19:55.362 --> 19:56.829
like you're the worst.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.731
I-I'm confused.
'Cause you were being super cool

19:58.765 --> 20:00.199
and now you're being
a huge bitch.

20:00.233 --> 20:02.168
-Did I, did I miss
something somewhere?
-Oh...

20:02.201 --> 20:03.670
-Yeah, you missed the part...
-What was that?

20:03.703 --> 20:06.339
...where you were just
a full-blown douchebag.

20:06.373 --> 20:07.407
Oh, I see where this is going.

20:07.440 --> 20:08.675
Do we have a-a soapbox
we can get for you?

20:08.708 --> 20:10.243
You gonna, you gonna get up
and tell me

20:10.277 --> 20:11.844
how much men suck-- is that
what's gonna happen here?

20:11.878 --> 20:13.380
No, I-I don't want
to tell you anything.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.847
I don't want to talk to you.

20:14.881 --> 20:15.915
-Yeah, no,
it's totally cool though.
-Yeah.

20:15.948 --> 20:17.417
Yeah, you just keep
being the way you are.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.518
Two new deflated balls.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.353
-Fuck you...
-And the Patriots!

20:20.387 --> 20:21.854
-MAN: And the Patriots.
-Oh, my God!

20:21.888 --> 20:22.922
That's what I'm talking about.
Chest bump, baby!

20:22.955 --> 20:24.857
-Fuckin' talking...
-(both shouting)

20:24.891 --> 20:26.526
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

20:26.559 --> 20:28.027
(laughs):
Oh, my God.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.729
I want to key his car.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.063
-Douches.
-Douches.

20:31.097 --> 20:33.533
(both laughing)

20:33.566 --> 20:34.901
Oh, God.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.937
Do the whole thing.
Don't be a bitch.

20:37.970 --> 20:40.239
*

20:40.273 --> 20:42.742
* I'm smokin' a backwood
full of them Skittles *

20:42.775 --> 20:44.744
* I feel like Craig
stealin' boxes, nigga... *

20:44.777 --> 20:46.713
KOURTNEY:
I would definitely

20:46.746 --> 20:49.115
-have another baby.
-Really?

20:49.148 --> 20:52.218
When I pulled Mason
out of my vagina,

20:52.251 --> 20:55.455
I had this maternal obligation

20:55.488 --> 20:58.224
to do the same
with my other two kids.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.560
Giving birth is so gnarly.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.562
No, it's such a good experience.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.896
It's actually really fun.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.465
I wish I could give birth.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.266
Nothing is li--

21:07.300 --> 21:09.902
Like, think, you have,
like, an orb in your...

21:09.936 --> 21:11.471
-Yeah.
-It's not an orb.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.740
Like, obviously, it must
suck in, like, in terms

21:13.773 --> 21:15.575
of, like, the vagina being
just ripped open or whatever.

21:15.608 --> 21:18.478
-Oh.
-But to, like, carry life and...

21:18.511 --> 21:20.813
Think about, like,
a pregnant woman.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.815
All the mass.

21:22.849 --> 21:25.652
A man actually gave birth.

21:25.685 --> 21:26.919
You could do it.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.588
What?

21:28.621 --> 21:29.922
It was a few years ago.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.091
-It was on Oprah.
-Oprah?

21:32.124 --> 21:33.793
I feel like CNN would've
had that story

21:33.826 --> 21:35.161
-way before Oprah.
-No, I think it was everywhere.

21:35.194 --> 21:36.996
I think it was
on magazine covers...

21:37.029 --> 21:39.098
I mean, any screen in...
in, like, the world would've

21:39.131 --> 21:40.767
-been like, "Breaking news!"
-It was, it was!

21:40.800 --> 21:42.268
Like, "everything's
different now."

21:42.301 --> 21:44.136
-You would've...
-Fuck you, I'm googling it.

21:44.170 --> 21:45.805
Yeah, google it--
google "man gives birth."

21:45.838 --> 21:48.274
It should pop up
all over the place.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.009
-"Man... gives birth."
-Yeah, a man gave birth.

21:50.042 --> 21:52.479
-No.
-A man gave birth, 100%.

21:52.512 --> 21:53.946
-No!
-2007.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.782
2007, what? There's no way.

21:55.815 --> 21:57.684
A trans man.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.819
"A trans man"?

21:59.852 --> 22:01.621
A transgender person.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.656
Transgender, well...

22:03.690 --> 22:05.625
And by the way, I'm...

22:05.658 --> 22:07.694
totally...

22:07.727 --> 22:09.496
aware that you have
transgender family,

22:09.529 --> 22:11.698
and I mean nothing by it, but...

22:11.731 --> 22:13.132
for the sake of this argument,

22:13.165 --> 22:15.368
I cannot give birth.

22:15.402 --> 22:17.837
-You cannot give birth, so...
-And that was the root of the...

22:17.870 --> 22:19.472
It was like me saying,
"I want to give birth."

22:19.506 --> 22:21.474
So I'll let you have this.

22:21.508 --> 22:24.310
Thanks, Kourtney Kardashian.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.978
Yeah, I know your full name.

22:26.012 --> 22:27.514
Don't know your middle name
or if you have one or...

22:27.547 --> 22:28.981
-Nice to meet you.
-Dave.

22:29.015 --> 22:31.183
-My middle name is Mary.
-Hey, let me ask you this.

22:31.217 --> 22:33.386
What's it like
for your entire family

22:33.420 --> 22:37.356
to be the most famous people
in the world at once together?

22:37.390 --> 22:40.493
I mean, I would rather do it
with my entire family

22:40.527 --> 22:42.495
than do it alone.

22:42.529 --> 22:44.330
Right, hmm.

22:44.363 --> 22:46.332
Poignant.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.834
And by the way,

22:47.867 --> 22:49.235
if I could give birth,
I'd pull it right

22:49.268 --> 22:50.937
-out of my asshole,
same way you do.
-(laughter)

22:56.275 --> 22:58.277
*

23:04.216 --> 23:06.419
Hey, Dave!

23:06.453 --> 23:09.055
Look who I just found trying
to get in using my name.

23:09.088 --> 23:10.356
(laughs)

23:10.389 --> 23:13.760
-What the fuck?
-What's up? (laughs)

23:13.793 --> 23:17.430
-How-- why are you guys here?
-Aw, man, Justin Bieber's
birthday party!

23:17.464 --> 23:20.867
-They used your name?
-Hey, is your grandma's
aunt's uncles coming?

23:20.900 --> 23:22.268
Should I alert
some people at the door?

23:22.301 --> 23:23.703
I could text them
right now if you want.

23:23.736 --> 23:24.871
I'm sorry, I did not...

23:24.904 --> 23:26.573
Wait, he told me what you said.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.207
Oh, yeah.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.609
Uh, he's the guy
that makes my beats.

23:29.642 --> 23:31.277
Okay, okay.

23:31.310 --> 23:33.079
Honestly, your beats, they suck.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.881
-You just crushed
my fucking dreams.
-Wait, wait.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.382
If you have great beats,
why don't you,

23:36.415 --> 23:37.917
why don't you send them to me?

23:37.950 --> 23:40.119
I don't got your
fucking number, nigga.

23:40.152 --> 23:41.721
I'll give it to you right now.

23:41.754 --> 23:46.058
Oh, my God, you look like
a mountain I want to climb.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.794
He doesn't even look drunk, man.

23:47.827 --> 23:49.562
DAVE:
Oh, my God.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.397
He's gonna be a problem.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.399
What, where the fuck
did you get that?

23:53.432 --> 23:55.101
The fridge--
they got some good shit

23:55.134 --> 23:56.969
-in that fridge.
-The fridge, what are you...?

23:57.003 --> 23:58.738
That could be, like,
eight days old or something.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.773
This is seafood--
what the fuck is wrong with you?

24:00.807 --> 24:02.642
Eight days? Oh, that's, oh...

24:03.676 --> 24:04.944
Okay, don't--

24:04.977 --> 24:06.813
I know what you're gonna say.

24:06.846 --> 24:09.782
He was determined
and very fucked up.

24:09.816 --> 24:12.284
So I didn't want him to come
alone and to be completely

24:12.318 --> 24:14.754
-embarrassing...
-I'm sorry.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.423
I should've invited you here
in the first place.

24:17.456 --> 24:20.092
It's so stupid I give a fuck
about what Justin Bieber thinks?

24:20.126 --> 24:21.828
-I can't ask for a plus-one?
-Wait, really?

24:21.861 --> 24:23.462
Yeah, I love you, I should
only care about, like,

24:23.496 --> 24:24.764
what the love of my life thinks.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.933
-(laughs): Really?! Oh...
-Yeah, I love you.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.935
-I love you.
-This is so...

24:28.968 --> 24:30.269
It's great to have you here.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.772
...surprisingly good of you.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.841
-Oh, well, get used to it,
Tootsie Pop.
-(laughs)

24:34.874 --> 24:37.610
Oh, is, uh... where is he?

24:37.644 --> 24:39.445
-Oh, Justin?
-Yeah.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.648
Oh, I don't even think
he's here, to be honest...

24:41.681 --> 24:43.282
-Just wanted to say bye.
-Oh!

24:43.315 --> 24:44.651
-It was so nice to meet you.
-You, too.

24:44.684 --> 24:46.853
-Bye. Take care.
-Bye! You're the best.

24:46.886 --> 24:48.354
Thank you, Kourt.

24:48.387 --> 24:50.657
-You're a good sport.
-Bye.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.124
So I just want you to know

24:52.158 --> 24:53.626
-I'm the first to admit it.
-I'm sorry.

24:53.660 --> 24:54.861
What just... what?

24:54.894 --> 24:56.128
-Oh, yeah.
-What just happened?

24:56.162 --> 24:57.196
-Kourt?
-Did you see what she...?

24:57.229 --> 24:58.698
-Kourt?!
-Kourt, yeah.

24:58.731 --> 25:00.299
We got in an argument
that I won.

25:00.332 --> 25:03.536
I heard her, I heard her-her
vocal fry in my own ears.

25:03.570 --> 25:05.805
-Her vocal fry?
-And I looked at
her beautiful skin.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.974
-What did she say?
What did she say exactly?
-I think she...

25:08.007 --> 25:10.176
She said, well, I think she said
to me, "You're the best."

25:10.209 --> 25:11.811
Oh, my God!

25:11.844 --> 25:15.514
Excuse me, fucking
cutie pie coming through.

25:15.548 --> 25:17.316
Oh, fuck!

25:17.349 --> 25:18.851
It's fucking Marshmello.

25:18.885 --> 25:21.554
Man, look at you.
(laughs)

25:21.588 --> 25:22.855
Look at me, guys,
I'm Marshmello!

25:22.889 --> 25:24.824
So what are you
gonna do about it then?

25:24.857 --> 25:27.894
Oh, wait, you're a table!
(laughs)

25:27.927 --> 25:29.729
-Do you talk?!
-He's fully blacked out.

25:29.762 --> 25:31.698
Are you a robot?
Hey, man, come on.

25:31.731 --> 25:32.899
We're, like, at somebody's
fucking birthday party,

25:32.932 --> 25:34.333
bro, take the fucking mask off.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.002
Be a normal guy
for one night, okay?

25:36.035 --> 25:37.837
Do we stop him?

25:37.870 --> 25:40.339
You fucking ugly bitch.

or something.

25:48.748 --> 25:50.583

Fuck! Bro, what is
wrong with you, man?!

We're too white for that.
We're not allowed.
