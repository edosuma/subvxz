01:04.897 --> 01:08.401
<i>Negative,
that's just a cam on the comer.</i>

01:49.842 --> 01:51.844
Stand by.

01:51.911 --> 01:53.982
On my mark.

01:54.047 --> 01:59.554
Three, two, one, mark.

01:59.619 --> 02:00.859
Move.

02:03.089 --> 02:05.330
Halt.

02:05.391 --> 02:06.995
I'll cover short wall.
You cover long wall.

02:07.026 --> 02:09.336
Do not proceed
until I give you a go. Copy?

02:09.395 --> 02:10.896
<i>COPY
COPY</i>

02:10.963 --> 02:12.408
I'm moving.

02:18.838 --> 02:20.943
Please! Please!

02:21.007 --> 02:22.748
<i>Nu one can
fucking save her.</i>

02:22.775 --> 02:24.777
I'm going to blow
your fucking brains out.

02:24.844 --> 02:26.755
<i>You've got two choices.</i>

02:26.813 --> 02:27.985
Put the gun
on the ground,

02:28.047 --> 02:29.754
or I'll put you down.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.625
Put the gun
on the ground now!

02:34.387 --> 02:36.060
Fuck you!

02:43.529 --> 02:44.769
I'm moving!

02:46.599 --> 02:47.907
Hit!

02:52.105 --> 02:53.709
Clear.

03:04.984 --> 03:06.429
SWAT,
give it up, man.

03:08.154 --> 03:09.656
I'd rather rot in hell.

04:41.180 --> 04:44.787
It's very important, too,
and I am super, super excited.

04:44.851 --> 04:46.626
Please, please,
look at the colors.

04:46.686 --> 04:48.996
It's driving me crazy.
You know how OCD I am.

04:49.055 --> 04:53.629
Can you at least give me to the end
of my shift to check them out'?

04:53.693 --> 04:55.172
Okay, well,
if you pick the color,

04:55.228 --> 04:57.139
I promise I will go buy
a baby doll outfit

04:57.196 --> 04:59.574
for you in that color.
I'll be waiting for you.

04:59.632 --> 05:02.203
<i>Yes, l promise. I will look
through every single one, okay?</i>

05:02.268 --> 05:04.077
<i>Even the pinks.</i>

05:04.136 --> 05:07.049
I said the pinks.
Okay, I can't wait.

05:07.106 --> 05:09.108
Okay.
Okay, love you.

05:09.175 --> 05:10.654
I love you, too. Bye.

05:10.710 --> 05:13.691
"I love you."

05:13.746 --> 05:19.059
Anyway, so how do
you think we did today'?

05:19.118 --> 05:21.120
<i>I think we did good, man. Yeah'?</i>

05:21.187 --> 05:23.030
I think we kicked ass.

05:32.899 --> 05:34.674
Sorry about that.
Is he there'?

05:41.841 --> 05:43.718
Hey. There's my girl.
How are you'?

05:43.776 --> 05:45.255
Good.

05:45.311 --> 05:47.621
Mmm.
Ooh, woo!

05:47.680 --> 05:50.160
Geez, Chris. What have you
been feeding her'? Shut up.

05:50.216 --> 05:51.251
Come eat.

05:51.317 --> 05:53.228
What's up, buddy'?

05:53.286 --> 05:55.095
<i>Sam, what's going on, man?</i>

05:55.154 --> 05:58.033
Man, lam starving, brother.

05:58.090 --> 06:00.127
<i>Tonight, on Crime Watch, the search</i>

06:00.192 --> 06:03.139
<i>for 19-year-old Janet Andrews
has come to a happy end.</i>

06:03.195 --> 06:06.233
<i>Police raided a suspected base camp
of human trafficking</i>

06:06.299 --> 06:08.779
When was this'?
Did you know about this'?

06:08.834 --> 06:10.609
Mm-mmm.

06:10.670 --> 06:12.308
Oh, my God.

06:12.572 --> 06:14.347
Hey, everybody, Sammy.
Sammy is on TV.

06:14.607 --> 06:17.986
<i>...rescue of Janet Andrews
and the other hostages.</i>

06:18.044 --> 06:20.251
<i>A shoot out occurred,
which resulted in the deaths</i>

06:20.313 --> 06:22.850
<i>of three of the alleged kidnappers.</i>

06:22.882 --> 06:24.623
<i>Now, back to you at the studio.</i>

06:30.189 --> 06:32.328
You can't play
cowboys forever, you know.

06:32.592 --> 06:35.869
I'm not harping
on you at all,

06:35.928 --> 06:39.740
but today you could
have been killed.

06:39.765 --> 06:43.770
And you don't just have the two
of us to worry about anymore.

06:43.836 --> 06:46.077
I took this job
because I wanted to do

06:46.138 --> 06:49.642
something important.
You know? I get it, though.

06:49.709 --> 06:52.189
I get it. I understand
where you're coming from.

06:52.244 --> 06:55.020
We--we do have
something important, though.

06:55.081 --> 06:58.255
I know. We've got a
baby on the way.

06:58.317 --> 07:01.161
I know.
And honestly, Chris,

07:03.155 --> 07:06.693
every single time you walk
out that door, I worry.

07:06.759 --> 07:10.172
And every time that phone
rings while you're on duty,

07:10.229 --> 07:12.732
it's ridiculous.
I lose a year of my life.

07:12.798 --> 07:14.368
I'm going to be gray
in, like, a year.

07:14.634 --> 07:17.171
Oh, my gosh, you are
not going to be gray.

07:17.236 --> 07:19.113
And if you are gray,
I will still love you,

07:19.171 --> 07:21.708
and we will buy you the
best hair dye in the world.

07:21.774 --> 07:23.344
But I don't need
to be gray.

07:23.409 --> 07:25.047
Listen to me.
You need to be safe.

07:25.111 --> 07:28.820
Yes, I will, okay'?
Every day I am safe.

07:28.881 --> 07:31.384
I came home tonight. I'm going
to come home tomorrow night.

07:31.651 --> 07:33.187
And I'm going to come
home every night

07:33.219 --> 07:35.199
for the rest of your life.
You know why'?

07:35.254 --> 07:36.790
Because I love you.

07:36.856 --> 07:38.802
So trust me, okay'?

07:38.858 --> 07:40.201
I like the way that sounds.

07:40.259 --> 07:42.796
Good. Okay, so,
keep your promise.

07:42.862 --> 07:44.398
I will keep my promise.
Okay.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.911
Ma'am.

09:36.041 --> 09:37.452
Son of 5..

09:40.379 --> 09:42.222
Get me everything
you have on this bastard.

09:42.281 --> 09:44.192
Be ready for a briefing
in 10 minutes.

09:44.216 --> 09:45.126
Ma'am.

09:49.789 --> 09:51.234
All right, everybody,
listen up.

09:51.290 --> 09:53.896
We've got a situation.

09:53.959 --> 09:55.939
A tier 3 target
was just identified

09:55.995 --> 09:58.339
arriving at LAX just
a short while ago.

09:58.397 --> 10:01.537
One Damian White.

10:01.801 --> 10:05.180
White is an ex special military
ops turned career criminal.

10:05.237 --> 10:07.808
<i>He's managed to stay off the
grid for the last seven years,</i>

10:07.873 --> 10:10.353
so we're not exactly sure his
reason for popping up again,

10:10.409 --> 10:12.218
but it can't be good.

10:12.244 --> 10:14.246
The last time, he managed
to hijack a shipment

10:14.313 --> 10:16.020
of raw radioactive materials

10:16.081 --> 10:19.358
for the ecu-terrorism
organization, the ELF.

10:19.418 --> 10:21.830
This character here
is Nick Koslow.

10:21.887 --> 10:23.889
Okay, Koslow is White's
right-hand man,

10:23.956 --> 10:25.492
his enforcer.

10:25.558 --> 10:28.095
You should all recognize
these three clowns.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.401
Now let's see if we can't get
some eyes on each one of them.

10:30.462 --> 10:32.373
See if we can't
flush Damian out.

10:32.431 --> 10:34.206
<i>Their roles
as black market arms dealers</i>

10:34.266 --> 10:37.304
makes them a likely
first stop for Damian.

10:37.369 --> 10:39.110
If White is back
out in the open,

10:39.171 --> 10:43.313
you can rest assured
that these men are, too.

10:43.375 --> 10:45.514
Other than that,
we are flying blind here.

10:45.578 --> 10:48.559
God knows I hate
flying blind.

10:48.614 --> 10:51.561
All right, let's get as much
information as possible,

10:51.617 --> 10:54.530
their local contacts,
known associates,

10:54.587 --> 10:57.033
any gossip that might be
brewing in the trenches.

10:57.089 --> 10:59.000
And I need it yesterday.

10:59.058 --> 11:01.129
Okay, connect
with your contacts.

11:01.193 --> 11:02.536
Let's nail this bastard.

11:10.035 --> 11:11.070
You okay, ma'am'?

11:13.439 --> 11:15.214
We need to alert
local authorities,

11:15.274 --> 11:17.276
and get the police captain
on the phone.

11:18.510 --> 11:21.320
Yes, ma'am.

11:21.380 --> 11:24.088
- This is <i>Uni!</i> 887.
- We <i>have a</i> report

11:24.149 --> 11:26.220
<i>of a 273 Delta in progress</i>

11:26.285 --> 11:28.595
<i>just east of your position.
Can you respond?</i>

11:28.654 --> 11:30.930
Yeah, we're on the corner
of Van Nuys Boulevard

11:30.990 --> 11:32.628
and Market.
10-4, in route.

12:09.028 --> 12:10.564
Oh, you fucking bitch.

12:16.302 --> 12:19.476
Jimmy. Jimmy. Jimmy what'?
Jimmy what'?

12:19.538 --> 12:21.381
Put the gun down, please.
Listen, Jimmy.

12:21.440 --> 12:23.386
Shut up. Shut up.

12:23.442 --> 12:26.582
I don't understand why
you're doing this. Shut up.

12:26.645 --> 12:28.989
I can't--
Shut up, shut up.

12:29.048 --> 12:31.289
Shut up.

12:39.558 --> 12:41.299
What is this'?

12:41.360 --> 12:42.430
What is this'?

12:42.494 --> 12:44.599
Mm-mmm.

12:44.663 --> 12:46.643
What is this'?
Mm-mmm.

12:46.699 --> 12:49.305
Huh'?
What is this'?

12:52.004 --> 12:54.450
My neighbors here, they're
normally good people.

12:54.506 --> 12:57.112
Okay. Right'? And I just hear
weird noises coming out of there.

12:57.142 --> 12:58.553
Listen to me,
why don't you calm down'?

12:58.610 --> 13:00.556
You sure they're
not just, you know,

13:00.612 --> 13:02.421
doing something?
What kind of noises?

13:07.019 --> 13:09.124
Tell me.
Tell me!

13:09.188 --> 13:12.567
Okay, I was just going to visit
my mom for a little while, okay'?

13:14.593 --> 13:16.300
Don't fucking lie to me.

13:16.362 --> 13:18.535
I was just going
to see her for the weekend.

13:18.597 --> 13:20.338
Who are you fucking'?
Tell me!

13:20.399 --> 13:22.072
I'm not fucking anyone.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.738
Believe me.

13:24.003 --> 13:25.641
Who are you fucking'?

13:25.704 --> 13:27.581
Trust me,
I'm not fucking anyone.

13:27.639 --> 13:29.550
Who are you fucking'?
I'm not fucking anyone.

13:29.608 --> 13:31.281
Look at these lips.
Look at these lips.

13:31.343 --> 13:32.686
Whose lips have
you been kissing?

13:32.745 --> 13:33.746
Don't! Don't!

13:34.013 --> 13:36.721
Tell me, come on.

13:36.782 --> 13:38.022
Tell me!

13:45.624 --> 13:49.037
Please, Jimmy,
put the gun down, please.

13:49.094 --> 13:50.471
Open your mouth.

13:50.529 --> 13:52.236
What are you doing?
Open your mouth!

13:52.297 --> 13:54.038
What are you doing?
Stop it!

13:54.099 --> 13:56.079
Come on, open your mouth.
You know how to.

13:56.135 --> 13:58.638
Come on. Open your mouth!
Sir, I need you to calm down.

13:58.704 --> 14:01.048
Tell me exactly what's going on.
What would Jesus do--

14:01.140 --> 14:03.120
What's your name?
Okay, sir, what's your name?

14:03.175 --> 14:04.552
Oh, shit!

14:09.415 --> 14:10.826
Hey, no!
Chris, get in there.

14:11.083 --> 14:13.085
Listen to me!
No, wait!

14:13.152 --> 14:14.597
No, no, no!

14:14.620 --> 14:15.724
Go, get in there!

14:16.622 --> 14:17.726
I'm going!

14:17.790 --> 14:21.203
Jimmy, Jimmy,
think about this.

14:21.260 --> 14:24.730
Don't do this, Jimmy.
Stop it, stop it, please.

14:43.682 --> 14:45.389
Hey, stop!
Hey, stop!

14:52.591 --> 14:53.797
Thank you.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.119
<i>Hicks, what's your 20?</i>

15:19.184 --> 15:20.629
<i>Do not pursue the suspect.</i>

15:20.686 --> 15:22.427
<i>Wait for backup.
[radio beeps}</i>

16:12.738 --> 16:14.740
I'm on the corner
of 8th and 9th Street.

16:14.806 --> 16:16.717
We need backup.
This is Officer Hicks.

16:16.775 --> 16:19.688
My partner is on his way.

16:19.745 --> 16:21.486
<i>We have a man down.</i>

16:21.547 --> 16:24.289
<i>Suspect down. Report.</i>

16:27.319 --> 16:30.528
<i>I'm reporting live from downtown
Los Angeles at a crime scene.</i>

16:30.589 --> 16:33.229
<i>Earlier today, a woman
was found at her house</i>

16:33.292 --> 16:34.737
<i>tied up by her boyfriend.</i>

16:34.760 --> 16:36.967
<i>The man ran
to avoid capture.</i>

16:37.229 --> 16:38.708
<i>An officer shot the man</i>

16:38.764 --> 16:40.744
<i>whose identity
remains unknown.</i>

16:40.799 --> 16:42.870
<i>The woman was saved
by Officer Cutter</i>

16:42.935 --> 16:43.970
<i>and Officer Hicks.</i>

16:47.406 --> 16:49.886
Hicks and Cutter,
get your asses in here.

16:59.418 --> 17:00.362
Sit down.

17:03.288 --> 17:04.733
<i>That was some stunt
you guys pulled.</i>

17:04.790 --> 17:07.828
Chief wanted to come down
on you guys very hard.

17:09.761 --> 17:13.573
<i>Captain... Did I fell
you to fucking talk?</i>

17:13.632 --> 17:18.512
Then shut up. Don't think you're
going to be cooling your heels

17:18.537 --> 17:20.710
and sipping Mai Tais
waiting for the review board

17:20.771 --> 17:22.773
to go over
that disaster yesterday.

17:22.840 --> 17:25.845
I'm putting yous
on babysitting detail.

17:25.911 --> 17:28.858
<i>Tonight, Senator James Abrahams
is doing a big deal</i>

17:28.914 --> 17:32.384
and he wants a couple cops
to keep an eye on his VIPs.

17:32.451 --> 17:35.432
Since I don't want
to break up this happy marriage,

17:35.487 --> 17:38.331
<i>you're going to accompany him
on his babysitting detail</i>

17:38.390 --> 17:40.631
until the review board
clears him for general duty.

17:40.692 --> 17:42.729
<i>I understand, sir.</i>

17:42.794 --> 17:45.604
I mean, I'm sure I could be used
better on some other detail.

17:45.664 --> 17:46.768
Don't you think'?

17:46.832 --> 17:48.675
You know, you should have
thought of that

17:48.734 --> 17:51.613
before you let
your fucking partner play hero.

17:54.273 --> 17:55.547
Now, get the fuck
out of here.

17:55.607 --> 17:56.642
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

17:58.710 --> 17:59.984
Hicks...

18:04.516 --> 18:06.427
<i>You're not going
to last in the PD</i>

18:06.485 --> 18:09.864
if you don't learn
to play by the rules.

18:09.921 --> 18:11.491
It's that simple.

18:41.653 --> 18:43.530
<i>LAPD.</i> Captain Ryan.

18:43.588 --> 18:45.659
<i>One moment, please,

18:49.328 --> 18:51.638
<i>Captain Ryan, you
have a call on line two.</i>

18:51.697 --> 18:53.506
Yeah, Captain Ryan.

19:03.475 --> 19:04.545
Hmm.

19:17.456 --> 19:18.662
Success.

19:18.724 --> 19:20.101
To life.

19:26.598 --> 19:28.407
<i>Get locked and loaded.</i>

19:28.467 --> 19:29.036
Copy that.

19:44.950 --> 19:47.055
So make sure we have
our insurance policy, okay'?

20:00.465 --> 20:01.773
Give me a kiss.

20:11.843 --> 20:13.550
Hey, look, um...

20:13.612 --> 20:14.920
I'm on a date, so...

20:14.980 --> 20:16.789
Ready to go.
It's show time.

20:42.441 --> 20:45.149
I'll have one of my agents
send over all the info.

20:48.613 --> 20:51.651
If that's right,
Damian White.

20:51.716 --> 20:53.525
Ma'am, I think
I got something.

20:53.585 --> 20:56.031
Okay, we'll be in touch.
What do you have'?

20:56.087 --> 20:58.693
Ma'am, my asset just reported
a large movement of firearms

20:58.757 --> 21:01.135
from a warehouse
in this area downtown.

21:09.801 --> 21:11.144
All right, that's good.

21:11.203 --> 21:13.046
Good work.
Thank you.

21:13.104 --> 21:15.084
All right, let's get
some people down there.

21:15.140 --> 21:16.016
I'm on it.

21:38.964 --> 21:43.106
Okay, you two are going to man
the south wing checking the IDs.

21:43.168 --> 21:46.843
The Senator is going to be
in the north wing with the main body.

21:46.905 --> 21:48.942
Why would he have us
on the south end,

21:49.007 --> 21:51.044
and everyone else on the north end'?
I mean, what's going on'?

21:51.109 --> 21:55.182
Because the Senator wants
all his team on the north side.

21:55.247 --> 21:57.818
<i>Why move all the gallery
security to the perimeter?</i>

21:57.883 --> 22:01.160
They know this place better than anyone.
Because he doesn't want any problems.

22:01.219 --> 22:03.665
<i>I guess there's a lot
of bigwigs here tonight, huh?</i>

22:03.722 --> 22:07.636
<i>The senator rubs elbows with
a whole bunch of high-profile people.</i>

22:07.692 --> 22:09.535
<i>He likes to make
a big splash.</i>

22:09.594 --> 22:11.073
<i>Okay, sounds easy enough.</i>

22:11.129 --> 22:12.540
Sounds like
we're on grunt duty.

22:12.597 --> 22:14.304
We hit the south wing,
stand still,

22:14.566 --> 22:16.671
watch stars, you guys
get to have fun.

22:16.735 --> 22:18.806
Correct? It's going
to be a good time.

22:18.870 --> 22:21.976
<i>[Coffins on radio} Just stay
out of everybody's' way.</i>

22:22.040 --> 22:24.816
<i>This is going to be a walk in the park.
Come an.</i>

22:24.876 --> 22:27.652
Okay, I understand
we're hereto work, not question.

22:27.712 --> 22:28.713
I get it.

22:28.780 --> 22:29.952
Take care of it.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.551
I'm going to go mingle.

22:31.616 --> 22:33.687
And don't cause any trouble.

22:33.752 --> 22:36.858
You see what
you get us into'?

22:36.922 --> 22:39.095
<i>There's no working
as a team, huh?</i>

22:40.191 --> 22:42.068
So why don't we go
the rest of the night

22:42.127 --> 22:43.970
and you try
not to fuck up, okay'?

22:44.029 --> 22:46.031
Just pay attention, man.
Seriously, please.

22:46.097 --> 22:48.134
<i>I got you, man. Please, please?
Look at me.</i>

22:48.199 --> 22:50.270
<i>Can you pay attention? Du
you think this is easy?</i>

22:50.335 --> 22:51.871
<i>Nu, I'm not saying it's easy.
Okay.</i>

22:51.937 --> 22:54.076
<i>Pay attention, okay?</i>

22:54.139 --> 22:56.915
Here she comes. That's what you're
worried about right now, a girl?

22:56.975 --> 22:58.318
Hey, look at this one.

22:58.577 --> 23:00.648
We're on detail,
and you're worried about a girl.

23:00.712 --> 23:02.658
Hello. How you holding
up down here?

23:02.714 --> 23:04.216
Doing well.
How are you'?

23:04.282 --> 23:06.125
Pretty well.
You boys having fun'?

23:06.184 --> 23:08.664
Couldn't be better.
That's good, man.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.859
Nice black.
Thank you, thank you.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.129
Sorry, this smells smelly.

23:12.157 --> 23:14.000
Yes?
It's been out.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.130
Shrimp? No, thank you, I'm good.

23:16.161 --> 23:17.606
Okay, enjoy-
Enjoy.

23:17.662 --> 23:18.936
Thank you.

23:25.370 --> 23:27.008
All right, we got work to do.
Come on.

23:27.038 --> 23:27.948
Let's go.

23:42.053 --> 23:43.896
<i>Hicks, I'm going 10-1.</i>

23:43.955 --> 23:45.298
<i>Cover me.
Yes, sir.</i>

25:34.299 --> 25:37.280
Make sure to
secure our hostages, okay'?

25:39.003 --> 25:41.279
If anybody gives you
any shit, kill them.

25:41.339 --> 25:43.751
<i>Everybody on the ground!</i>

25:43.808 --> 25:47.779
Everybody on the ground now!

25:47.846 --> 25:49.450
<i>This is not a game!</i>

25:49.514 --> 25:52.085
Shots fired!
Shots fired!

25:52.150 --> 25:54.391
Collins, this is Sam.
Say that again.

25:54.452 --> 25:57.228
I repeat, City Hall
is under attack.

25:57.288 --> 25:59.268
Sam, Cutter!
Copy.

25:59.324 --> 26:00.962
Cutter, come in,
there's shots fired

26:01.025 --> 26:02.333
on the north end.
What's your ETA'?

26:07.999 --> 26:10.070
Which...

26:10.135 --> 26:12.308
one of you...

26:12.337 --> 26:13.509
<i>is Dr. Land's?</i>

26:16.374 --> 26:18.445
<i>Somebody better speak up.</i>

26:20.278 --> 26:22.280
<i>Come on, compliance,
people, compliance.</i>

26:22.814 --> 26:24.088
<i>The sooner
we figure things out,</i>

26:24.149 --> 26:26.390
<i>the sooner we can
all get out of here.</i>

26:26.451 --> 26:27.862
Yo, what the fuck, man'?

26:29.487 --> 26:31.467
What the fuck'?

26:31.489 --> 26:33.264
We're just trying to have
a good time, man.

26:33.324 --> 26:34.997
You got something
to say, hipster man'?

26:43.468 --> 26:46.938
I'm not going to ask again!

26:50.408 --> 26:56.984
You know what'? Everyone, jewelry,
wallets, cell phones, in the bag now.

26:57.048 --> 26:59.528
Collect them. Come on,
compliance, people, compliance.

26:59.584 --> 27:00.995
<i>Get them in the bag.</i>

27:01.052 --> 27:03.123
<i>Don? try to be a hero.</i>

27:03.188 --> 27:05.828
<i>Compliance means
you stay alive.</i>

27:05.890 --> 27:09.360
You don't want to end up
like this shithead here!

27:09.427 --> 27:10.599
What about you, huh'?

27:10.862 --> 27:14.036
Hey,you look
like a doctor.

27:14.098 --> 27:16.237
No, no, you got
the wrong guy.

27:16.301 --> 27:18.008
Got a stethoscope
under there?

27:18.069 --> 27:20.447
Don't play with me. Don't play with me.
Check him out.

27:20.505 --> 27:21.575
I'm not a doctor, man.

27:26.845 --> 27:30.190
<i>Tick-took, you are messing
with my patience.</i>

27:30.248 --> 27:34.025
I will find out
who the good Dr. Landis is.

27:40.358 --> 27:42.463
Get over here.

27:43.962 --> 27:45.407
Get down, get down!

27:45.463 --> 27:47.033
What do you want with me'?

27:47.098 --> 27:49.009
Please.

27:49.067 --> 27:52.276
Please, don't hurt
my little girl.

27:52.337 --> 27:53.475
Oh, please.

27:55.273 --> 27:57.310
Don't take my baby!

27:58.877 --> 28:00.015
It'll be okay!

28:00.078 --> 28:01.955
Mommy!
Quiet.

28:03.548 --> 28:05.050
Baby, hold on.

28:05.116 --> 28:06.094
Mom.

28:06.150 --> 28:07.390
Quiet, you.

28:12.523 --> 28:15.367
<i>What's your name,
sweetheart?</i>

28:15.426 --> 28:16.564
It's Landis.

28:17.929 --> 28:19.931
So, you are Landis.

28:19.998 --> 28:21.978
Mommy!
Quiet.

28:22.033 --> 28:25.242
That was" that was
your daughter, wasn't it'?

28:25.303 --> 28:29.046
You were setting
a bad example as a parent.

28:29.107 --> 28:31.053
You were going to let
all these people die.

28:31.075 --> 28:33.351
I love you!
Quiet!

28:34.646 --> 28:36.319
I'm disappointed in you.

28:41.185 --> 28:42.459
Very disappointed.

28:42.520 --> 28:43.999
Mom!

28:44.055 --> 28:46.968
Be quiet!

28:47.025 --> 28:48.504
<i>No, don? hurt her.</i>

28:48.559 --> 28:50.163
Why don't you leave
the little girl alone?

28:50.228 --> 28:51.502
Shut the fuck up.
Get down!

28:51.562 --> 28:53.007
Get down, get down.

28:53.064 --> 28:54.509
Like him, you'll be dead.

28:56.034 --> 28:57.104
<i>Kill him.</i>

29:01.306 --> 29:02.683
<i>(Dr. Landis}
Please don't hurt her.</i>

29:02.941 --> 29:04.978
Secure our guests.
We're within 30 seconds.

29:05.043 --> 29:06.021
Get them up, let's go.

29:06.077 --> 29:07.317
Let's go!

29:07.378 --> 29:08.618
Get them up!
Get up.

29:08.680 --> 29:09.954
<i>You know where to get them.</i>

29:10.014 --> 29:10.992
UP, UP-

29:12.216 --> 29:13.559
UP, up, up.

29:13.618 --> 29:14.961
UP, UP-

29:15.019 --> 29:17.226
Go. We're in the wind.
Let's go, people.

29:19.257 --> 29:22.238
Make sure we have the insurance
policy, okay, asshole?

29:22.293 --> 29:23.670
<i>Let's go!</i>

29:25.430 --> 29:26.500
Don't you fucking move!

29:28.499 --> 29:30.638
Get your ass up.
Get up!

29:39.978 --> 29:41.321
Get the fuck up.

29:45.083 --> 29:47.063
Get up!

29:49.587 --> 29:52.193
Get up!

30:13.411 --> 30:14.412
<i>Get the fuck up!</i>

30:25.556 --> 30:26.660
Drop your fucking weapon!

30:29.060 --> 30:31.597
<i>Hey, look,
you get locked and loaded.</i>

30:31.662 --> 30:33.733
I think something
is wrong.

30:33.798 --> 30:35.641
Drop the fucking gun.

30:35.700 --> 30:38.704
<i>Really wrong.
I got to go.</i>

30:38.770 --> 30:40.340
If I don't come back,
just leave.

30:40.405 --> 30:42.749
Okay'? No big deal.

30:42.807 --> 30:44.343
If I don't come back,
just leave.

30:46.044 --> 30:47.523
<i>Drop the fucking gun.</i>

30:47.578 --> 30:48.579
Drop it.

30:48.613 --> 30:50.354
Put it down.

30:50.415 --> 30:52.156
Put your fucking gun down.

30:52.216 --> 30:53.456
Cutter, talk to me.

30:55.186 --> 30:57.462
I'm okay.

30:57.522 --> 30:59.092
Chris, talk to me.

30:59.157 --> 31:01.603
<i>Stay with me.
I'm all right.</i>

31:08.633 --> 31:10.613
<i>Stay with me, Chris.</i>

31:14.272 --> 31:15.808
Chris!

32:05.189 --> 32:07.430
He's not breathing. I
don't think he has a pulse.

32:07.492 --> 32:10.234
There's blood everywhere. There's
a woman screaming in the back.

32:10.294 --> 32:12.399
They took our phones.

32:12.463 --> 32:14.204
Yes.

32:14.265 --> 32:16.871
No, I don't know
if he stopped breathing.

32:17.135 --> 32:19.581
I don't know.
I don't know.

32:19.637 --> 32:22.709
Sam, talk to me. Sam,
look at me, look at me.

32:22.773 --> 32:24.548
I don't think he has a pulse.

32:24.575 --> 32:26.350
We're at City Hall. Look at me.
Look at me.

32:26.410 --> 32:27.445
Look at me.
Look at me.

32:29.881 --> 32:31.758
Look at me, Sam.
Sam, look at me!

32:31.816 --> 32:33.295
Look at me, man.
Look at me.

32:33.351 --> 32:34.489
Look at me, Sam. Sam.

32:34.552 --> 32:36.293
Sam, Sam.

32:44.362 --> 32:45.864
Give me the phone,
give me the phone.

32:45.930 --> 32:48.342
Listen, this is
Officer Chris Cutter.

32:48.399 --> 32:49.742
Yes, we've been jacked.

32:49.800 --> 32:50.870
We're at City Hall.

32:50.935 --> 32:52.642
I don't know, maybe
four, five, six, yes.

32:52.703 --> 32:54.740
They've got guns.
They've got automatic weapons.

32:54.805 --> 32:56.478
I have no idea
where they're at.

32:56.541 --> 32:58.248
We've got a deceased male,
middle-aged,

32:58.309 --> 32:59.788
about 25 years old.

32:59.844 --> 33:02.916
Please, I'm begging you, get
somebody here now. Okay'? Please.

33:03.181 --> 33:04.319
Keep pressure on that.

33:04.348 --> 33:05.622
Hold this, hold this.

33:14.325 --> 33:15.895
<i>Let me out of here!</i>

33:20.665 --> 33:22.611
I was able
to getaway.

33:22.667 --> 33:23.975
They still have
my daughter.

33:24.235 --> 33:25.578
Please help me.
Come here.

33:33.344 --> 33:36.348
Ma'am, this just came in.
What is it'?

33:36.414 --> 33:39.224
<i>AH units be advised,
shots fired at City Hall.</i>

33:39.283 --> 33:40.785
<i>Any available unit respond.</i>

33:40.851 --> 33:42.353
<i>Potential hostage situation.</i>

33:42.420 --> 33:44.263
<i>Expect heavy firepower.</i>

33:44.322 --> 33:47.462
<i>Reports from inside suggest
military grade weaponry.</i>

33:47.525 --> 33:50.005
Get me that
security footage.

33:50.261 --> 33:52.400
<i>Everybody on the ground!</i>

33:52.463 --> 33:53.567
<i>This is not a game!</i>

33:55.299 --> 33:56.903
<i>Which one of you</i>

33:56.934 --> 33:58.845
<i>is Dr. Landis?</i>

33:58.903 --> 34:01.713
Whoa, whoa, did
he just say Landis'?

34:03.441 --> 34:05.352
<i>Everybody on the ground!</i>

34:05.409 --> 34:06.854
<i>This is not a game!</i>

34:08.646 --> 34:10.420
<i>Which one of you</i>

34:10.481 --> 34:12.460
<i>is Dr. Landis?</i>

34:12.516 --> 34:14.324
Son of a bitch.

34:14.385 --> 34:16.797
<i>Mum!</i>

34:16.853 --> 34:20.630
You mean to tell me that
local PD is compromised.

34:20.690 --> 34:23.399
<i>According to the NCIC,
that's Paul Stein.</i>

34:23.460 --> 34:25.031
<i>He's a hitman.</i>

34:25.295 --> 34:27.003
In and out of prison
since he could carry a gun.

34:27.264 --> 34:30.542
And if I had to guess,
that's a stolen uniform.

34:30.601 --> 34:32.877
<i>Nicholas Kosiow,

34:32.937 --> 34:34.610

34:39.010 --> 34:41.489
Listed as having fled
the country

34:41.545 --> 34:45.458
after he slipped away during a
weapons drop that he organized.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.518
And known associate
of Damian White.

34:49.320 --> 34:51.561
Any sign of Damian'?

34:51.621 --> 34:52.896
No, ma'am.

34:52.956 --> 34:55.301
Nothing.

34:55.359 --> 34:56.804
Not yet anyways.

34:56.860 --> 34:59.705
<i>Wait, wait, hold it.
Who's that?</i>

34:59.730 --> 35:01.835
<i>That's-
that's Chris Cutter, ma'am.</i>

35:03.567 --> 35:05.478
Is he one of ours
or one of theirs?

35:05.536 --> 35:06.879
<i>Oh, he's one of ours.</i>

35:06.937 --> 35:08.314
<i>Cutter is 32 years old.</i>

35:08.372 --> 35:10.443

35:10.508 --> 35:12.784

35:14.912 --> 35:17.552
<i>Born in South Carolina,

35:19.917 --> 35:22.329

35:22.386 --> 35:25.765

surveillance from the street cams

35:25.823 --> 35:27.962

LoJack system,

35:28.025 --> 35:29.629

35:29.694 --> 35:31.002
You got it.

35:51.015 --> 35:53.359
<i>beep, man on radio]
This is an emergency alert.</i>

35:53.417 --> 35:55.988
<i>Breaking news
from Senator Abrahams' charity gather.</i>

35:56.053 --> 35:58.533
<i>Reports of shots fired.</i>

35:58.589 --> 36:01.365
<i>No reports of number of casualties
or who is behind the attack.</i>

36:01.425 --> 36:03.928
<i>Be advised, all roads
surrounding the incident</i>

36:06.063 --> 36:07.770
<i>Please use
an alternative route.</i>

36:07.832 --> 36:10.039
<i>More updates as things unfold.</i>

36:10.101 --> 36:12.775
<i>And now back to
some more music for your soul</i>

36:12.837 --> 36:16.944
<i>right here at 105.9 WWKY.</i>

36:22.513 --> 36:23.890
Please pick up.
Please pick up.

36:25.883 --> 36:30.423
Hello. Hey, I'm so
glad you're okay.

36:30.488 --> 36:31.831
No, I'm listening
to the news.

36:31.889 --> 36:34.460
I hear reports of gunfire
and casualties. Babe.

36:34.525 --> 36:35.799
<i>Yes, I know.</i>

36:35.860 --> 36:37.601
Baby, listen to me.
You need to go home.

36:37.661 --> 36:39.504
Go to your mother's house.
I will call you.

36:39.563 --> 36:41.565
I knew this was going to happen.
I can't lose you.

36:41.632 --> 36:43.475
I can't-J can't
lose you right now.

36:43.534 --> 36:45.536
You trust me, right'?

36:46.604 --> 36:48.948
I think you need
to come home.

36:49.006 --> 36:50.007
I love you, okay'?

36:50.074 --> 36:53.146
Now, just go home, go to your
mother's house, do something, please.

36:53.411 --> 36:55.084
<i>Okay?
I'll call you soon.</i>

36:55.146 --> 36:56.557
Okay.

36:58.649 --> 37:00.026
I love you, too, Chris.

37:12.430 --> 37:14.137
And I got him.

37:14.198 --> 37:15.802
They're heading west
on the 10.

37:18.969 --> 37:22.849
I've got Cutter
on the phone, ma'am.

37:22.907 --> 37:28.220
Cutter, this is Special Agent Melanie Hamlin.
I need you to listen carefully.

37:28.479 --> 37:31.517
You are to proceed directly to a
safe house at a secure location.

37:31.582 --> 37:34.586
I will have one of my agents
forward you the coordinates now.

37:34.652 --> 37:37.132
<i>Okay, but ma'am, you need to
tell me what's going on first.</i>

37:37.188 --> 37:38.997
That's classified.
All I can tell you

37:39.056 --> 37:41.593
is that you are transporting
atop priority asset.

37:41.659 --> 37:43.639
<i>Dr. Landis
is extremely important</i>

37:43.694 --> 37:45.640
to the International
Bioterrorism Division.

37:45.696 --> 37:47.505
I need to secure her
immediately.

37:47.565 --> 37:49.602
<i>Look, I don'! care about
what's classified, okay?</i>

37:49.667 --> 37:51.647
They shot my partner,
and they gather daughter.

37:51.702 --> 37:54.114
So I need to speak
to my superiors right now.

37:54.171 --> 37:57.914
You need to proceed directly
to the secure location.

37:57.975 --> 37:59.750
I will contact
your superiors

37:59.810 --> 38:01.517
and they will be in touch.

38:01.579 --> 38:02.216
<i>I understand.</i>

38:04.582 --> 38:07.791
All right, how long before we can
get some info on those hostages?

38:07.852 --> 38:09.627
An hour, maybe two.

38:09.687 --> 38:12.065
Good, all right, also
confirm that Claire Landis

38:12.122 --> 38:13.795
was on that guest list.

38:13.858 --> 38:15.633
I'll send a transfer
for the asset, ma'am.

38:15.693 --> 38:17.104
<i>Whoa, this is
not our jurisdiction.</i>

38:17.161 --> 38:19.038
Until we know
of White's involvement,

38:19.096 --> 38:21.838
we are to assist only.

38:24.635 --> 38:25.807
Roger that, ma'am.

38:59.036 --> 39:01.812
My, my, my, my.

39:01.872 --> 39:04.079
<i>What the fuck
just happened?</i>

39:08.212 --> 39:10.590
<i>I've gut the call</i>

39:10.648 --> 39:13.959
saying that my car
was rerouted.

39:14.018 --> 39:17.090
<i>And I've got
a hostage situation.</i>

39:17.154 --> 39:20.328
Four fucking hostages, Mike.

39:20.591 --> 39:24.232
How did they disappear and taken from
underneath the nose of your officers?

39:24.295 --> 39:27.037
I lost a few
of those officers, Jim.

39:27.097 --> 39:30.237
And we had no way
of seeing this coming.

39:33.270 --> 39:36.251
Do you know
who was at the event'?

39:36.307 --> 39:38.844
Hmm'? Do you'?

39:38.909 --> 39:41.856
Do you know if the media will
get their hands on that'?

39:41.912 --> 39:45.724
We are doing everything
that can be done.

39:45.783 --> 39:48.764
Not now, not in this
damn situation right now.

39:48.819 --> 39:50.662
Listen to me...

39:50.721 --> 39:53.827
the live techs are working
to ID the John Doe from the hallway.

39:53.891 --> 39:57.270
We will have
some information soon.

39:59.096 --> 40:03.067
Hmm. I cannot believe it.

40:03.133 --> 40:05.135
I cannot believe it.

40:08.172 --> 40:11.642
With all night it had
to be tonight, huh'?

40:11.709 --> 40:13.814
And tomorrow
is the conference.

40:13.877 --> 40:16.153
We're doing all we can do,

40:16.213 --> 40:18.124
but there's just
not that much information

40:18.182 --> 40:20.128
to work on yet.

40:20.184 --> 40:23.757
Really?

40:23.787 --> 40:26.324
I want you

40:26.390 --> 40:29.030
to make sure that
you take care of this

40:29.093 --> 40:31.164
quietly and quickly.

40:31.228 --> 40:32.639
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

40:32.696 --> 40:34.642
I need your help, Mike.

40:37.768 --> 40:40.180
You know what will happen to
me if the press finds out'?

40:40.237 --> 40:43.912
Hmm?

40:43.974 --> 40:46.045
Done.
Done.

40:46.110 --> 40:51.389
I'm so close to retirement
and then this fucking happens.

40:51.649 --> 40:54.186
Unbelievable.
Un-fucking-believable.

40:57.021 --> 40:59.092
You asked
for a couple of cops

40:59.156 --> 41:02.194
to keep an eye on your VIPs.

41:02.259 --> 41:05.706
There was no indication that there
was going to be a terrorist strike.

41:15.072 --> 41:19.714
What do you think
we should do, Mike?

41:23.047 --> 41:26.119
Until they contact us,
there's nothing to do.

41:26.183 --> 41:30.461
And this is
your suggestion?

41:30.721 --> 41:32.997
To sit down
on our hands and...

41:37.194 --> 41:39.367
wait for our
ransom call, right'?

41:39.430 --> 41:42.900
It's all I've got, Jim.

41:42.966 --> 41:45.105
I'm sorry.

41:45.169 --> 41:47.115
That's it'?

41:47.171 --> 41:49.378
That's the best that
you can come up with'?

41:49.440 --> 41:50.976
Mike? Really?

42:18.302 --> 42:20.179
Mary washed
her little lamb'?

42:20.237 --> 42:23.013
<i>Well, she played
with the three blind mice.</i>

42:26.944 --> 42:29.424
Come on,
this way, ma'am.

42:29.480 --> 42:32.290
Ma'am, straight forward. We got a
clean room right here on the right.

42:32.349 --> 42:37.321
Mikayla'? Mikayla will be okay.
Your daughter will be fine, okay'?

42:37.387 --> 42:39.799
Just right this way.

42:39.857 --> 42:41.097
Where's my daughter?

42:41.158 --> 42:42.933
Ma'am, ma'am,
just sit down.

42:48.031 --> 42:49.510
I got you.
Be still.

42:49.767 --> 42:51.007
There you go.

42:55.005 --> 42:57.110
I know it's not
a hotel, ma'am.

42:57.174 --> 42:59.085
Sheets are not
the cleanest.

42:59.143 --> 43:00.781
We got fresh towels.

43:00.844 --> 43:02.050
We got water.

43:02.112 --> 43:04.490
You let me know if you need
anything, all right'?

43:09.119 --> 43:11.827
Cutter, you know
the house rules.

43:11.889 --> 43:14.096
All lines are secure.

43:14.158 --> 43:16.434
Knock twice if you
need anything, all right'?

43:18.796 --> 43:20.207
Please tell me
my daughter is okay.

43:20.264 --> 43:22.335
Please just help me
find my daughter.

43:22.399 --> 43:24.902
Ma'am, I'm going to help you
find your daughter, okay'?

43:24.968 --> 43:27.346
Just relax.

43:27.404 --> 43:30.214
John, just get some coffee
and a secure line, please.

43:30.240 --> 43:31.446
Yes, sir.

43:33.377 --> 43:34.947
Where is my daughter?

43:35.012 --> 43:36.855
Where is my daughter?

43:36.914 --> 43:38.154
I will do
whatever you want.

43:38.215 --> 43:40.252
I will answer whatever
questions you want.

43:40.317 --> 43:43.389
Just help me
find my daughter.

43:43.453 --> 43:46.195
<i>She was wearing
a pink dress.</i>

43:46.256 --> 43:49.567
She's going to go home to visit
her grandma for Christmas

43:49.827 --> 43:51.101
and bake cookies,

43:51.161 --> 43:53.004
and I just
love her so much.

43:53.063 --> 43:56.510
You've got to help me
find my daughter, Chris.

43:56.567 --> 43:58.012
Please.

43:59.570 --> 44:02.346
I'm pregnant.  Chris!

44:04.341 --> 44:06.378
<i>Just help
me find my daughter.</i>

44:12.282 --> 44:13.852
I love you.

44:30.033 --> 44:33.913
Mikayla, honey, where are you'?
Are you okay'?

44:33.971 --> 44:36.008
<i>Hello again.
Who is this'?</i>

44:36.073 --> 44:38.417
Hey, who is this'?

44:38.475 --> 44:40.546
<i>Christopher, Christopher,
Christopher.</i>

44:40.611 --> 44:44.286
Hey, it's very unfortunate
that we are in this predicament,

44:44.348 --> 44:46.157
but we are.

44:46.216 --> 44:48.059
<i>You have something
that I very much want.</i>

44:49.519 --> 44:51.157
<i>You up for a little game?</i>

44:51.221 --> 44:53.497
I said, you up
for little game'?

44:53.557 --> 44:55.002
<i>What do you mean, game?</i>

44:55.058 --> 44:57.004
I'm not playing
any game.

45:07.170 --> 45:09.047
Yes, Sergeant Kane.
I've got Cutter for you.

45:09.106 --> 45:10.449
You're going
to want to hear this.

45:13.243 --> 45:15.416
Kane,
I wish I could say--

45:17.247 --> 45:20.126
<i>Who is this?
Who am I talking to?</i>

45:20.183 --> 45:22.220
<i>I have four people
who would very much</i>

45:22.286 --> 45:24.391
<i>like to leave
in the next 24 hours.</i>

45:24.454 --> 45:28.129
<i>They don? want to die.</i>

45:32.229 --> 45:34.709
<i>You're not going to let
them die, are you, Christopher?</i>

45:34.965 --> 45:36.376
Are you?

45:36.433 --> 45:39.607
<i>Oh, so you think playing with
peoples lives, that's a game?</i>

45:39.670 --> 45:41.115
What do you want'?

45:41.171 --> 45:44.948
No! Hey.

45:45.008 --> 45:47.955
That's not how
this game works.

45:48.011 --> 45:49.957
Okay?

45:50.013 --> 45:52.220
<i>You don? ask me questions.</i>

45:52.282 --> 45:54.228
<i>I ask you questions.</i>

45:54.284 --> 45:56.628
<i>Okay, you have something
that I very much want,</i>

45:56.687 --> 45:59.224
like I said,
and I have three fat cats

45:59.289 --> 46:02.031
and a little girl that would very
much like to go home, okay'?

46:02.092 --> 46:03.594
I'm sure we can
come to some--

46:03.660 --> 46:06.266
some kind of agreement
and arrangement.

46:06.330 --> 46:08.503
But only if you
follow the rules.

46:08.565 --> 46:12.069
<i>You have a pen? Because you
might want to [at this dawn.</i>

46:12.135 --> 46:16.379
One, absolutely
no more press!

46:18.208 --> 46:21.314
What does that mean?
You heard that, right'?

46:21.378 --> 46:25.258
Shh.

46:25.315 --> 46:28.353
I want it quiet.

46:28.418 --> 46:30.659
You hear that'?
It's really quiet.

46:30.721 --> 46:33.258
I want it that quiet.

46:33.323 --> 46:37.362
Two, absolutely
no feds.

46:37.427 --> 46:40.306
I don't want to wake up with some
FBI drones kicking down my door.

46:40.364 --> 46:43.243
If that happens and they die just
like your poor partner, okay'?

46:43.300 --> 46:45.302
Listen to me, you cock
sucking motherfucker,

46:45.369 --> 46:47.144
I swear to God,
when I find you

46:47.204 --> 46:49.275
lam going to kill you.
You hear me'?

46:49.339 --> 46:50.647
<i>Listen to me, asshole.</i>

46:50.707 --> 46:52.084
Don't be rude.

46:52.142 --> 46:53.382
It's unnecessary.

46:53.443 --> 46:55.753
Three, I want a plane.

46:56.013 --> 46:58.584
I said I want a plane.

46:58.648 --> 47:00.423
A midsize,
you know, a G6.

47:00.484 --> 47:02.293
No miles,
full tank of gas.

47:02.352 --> 47:04.457
You know, the kind
those Hollywood guys fly.

47:04.521 --> 47:07.161
<i>Okay?
And the last thing,</i>

47:07.224 --> 47:09.397
I want $100 million.

47:12.195 --> 47:14.197
<i>I said I want
$100 million.</i>

47:14.264 --> 47:17.268
<i>want $100 million and a G6.
What's wrong with that?</i>

47:17.334 --> 47:19.245
Who wouldn't want that'?

47:19.302 --> 47:22.044
And you're going to give
it to me, aren't you'?

47:22.105 --> 47:24.312
That's not too much to ask for,
all things considered.

47:24.374 --> 47:27.116
<i>Oh, and Christopher,
I don't know if you remember,</i>

47:27.177 --> 47:31.421
but I have four bartering chips,
and every six hours that pass

47:31.481 --> 47:33.825
that I don't get what I want,
I don't give a fuck what it is.

47:34.084 --> 47:36.291
I may improvise and say I
want to get a blow job,

47:36.353 --> 47:40.529
and I don't get it, you will
have killed one of these people.

47:40.590 --> 47:42.194
Okay?

47:42.259 --> 47:44.239
So...

47:44.294 --> 47:46.433
let's get the ball rolling,
shall we'?

47:49.833 --> 47:52.336
Let's get the ball rolling,
I said, shall we'?

48:05.415 --> 48:06.621
That's called a gun

48:06.683 --> 48:08.321
you just heard.

48:08.385 --> 48:10.160
<i>Hey, I am
a cold-blooded killer.</i>

48:10.220 --> 48:12.496
<i>It's what I do best.
I kill people.</i>

48:12.556 --> 48:14.661
Now I have
three bartering chips.

48:14.724 --> 48:15.862
Don't forget about me.

48:17.561 --> 48:19.700
This salad sucks.
Who made this shit'?

48:19.763 --> 48:22.107
Sorry, sir. It's all right.
Don't be sorry, man.

48:22.165 --> 48:23.371
Just do.

48:23.433 --> 48:27.609
Is this a fucking joke?
Shh! Cutter.

48:27.671 --> 48:30.379
Cutter! So what are you
going to do about it'?

48:30.440 --> 48:32.579
<i>Jesus Christ, Cutter.
You stay put.</i>

48:32.642 --> 48:34.349
<i>We're coming to you.</i>

48:39.749 --> 48:43.196
You better start talking
right fucking now.

48:43.253 --> 48:45.790
You get the IT guys
to trace that number.

48:45.822 --> 48:49.133
Right now, Cutter is
the only solid lead we have.

48:49.192 --> 48:51.536
Now Kane, I need you
to run point on this,

48:51.595 --> 48:53.575
and we got to move
on this fast, my man.

48:53.630 --> 48:55.576
If I'm running point,
I'm choosing my own team.

48:55.632 --> 48:58.476
<i>They understand
the importance</i>

48:58.535 --> 48:59.809
of keeping things quiet.

48:59.836 --> 49:01.838
That is my team, sir.

49:01.905 --> 49:02.849
You got it.

49:12.682 --> 49:14.753
Get me personnel.

49:40.644 --> 49:44.888
<i>Chris! They'll die just
like your poor partner.</i>

49:44.948 --> 49:47.827
<i>They'll die
just like your poor partner.</i>

49:56.793 --> 49:59.637
<i>You might want
to jut this dawn.</i>

49:59.696 --> 50:02.734
<i>One...</i>

50:06.269 --> 50:09.910
<i>Two, absolutely no feds.</i>

50:09.973 --> 50:11.850
<i>I don? want to wake up
with some FBI drones</i>

50:11.908 --> 50:13.888
<i>kicking down my door.
That happens and they die</i>

50:13.944 --> 50:17.357
<i>just like
your poor partner, okay?</i>

50:17.414 --> 50:19.951
<i>And lastly,
I wan! $100 million.</i>

50:20.217 --> 50:22.891
<i>You're going to give it
to me, aren't you?</i>

50:22.953 --> 50:25.297
<i>That's not too much to ask
for, all things considered.</i>

50:25.355 --> 50:27.426
<i>Oh, and Christopher,
I don't know if you remember,</i>

50:27.490 --> 50:29.800
<i>but I have
four bartering chips.</i>

50:29.859 --> 50:33.466
<i>Every six hours that pass
that I don't get what I want,</i>

50:33.496 --> 50:34.736
<i>I don? give a fuck what it is.</i>

50:34.798 --> 50:37.244
<i>I may improvise and say I
want to get a blow job.</i>

50:37.300 --> 50:39.940
<i>and I dun '1 get it, you will
have killed one of these people.</i>

50:40.003 --> 50:41.949
<i>Okay?</i>

50:42.005 --> 50:44.611
<i>So let's get the ball rolling,
shall we?</i>

50:44.674 --> 50:47.416
<i>Let's get the ball rolling,
I said, shall we?</i>

50:49.346 --> 50:52.486
Where the fuck
is the info on these hostages?

50:56.553 --> 50:59.329
Does he have
any connection to Landis?

50:59.389 --> 51:02.768
We've got the basics, but nothing
connecting him to the doctor, no.

51:03.994 --> 51:05.871
Give me what you've got.

51:09.866 --> 51:11.971
The first is Alan Brolin.

51:12.035 --> 51:13.742
CEO, Pharmatech.

51:13.803 --> 51:16.306
<i>Billionaire,
on a second marriage,</i>

51:16.373 --> 51:19.718
two kids,
no connection to Damian,

51:19.776 --> 51:20.948
and no criminal history.

51:21.011 --> 51:23.582
<i>Next is Joel Fisher.</i>

51:23.647 --> 51:25.718
<i>He's one of our state
representatives.</i>

51:25.782 --> 51:27.557
Typical upper
middle-class background,

51:27.617 --> 51:29.619
married, no kids.

51:29.686 --> 51:31.632
<i>Got into some trouble in college,</i>

51:31.688 --> 51:33.565
but nothing major.

51:33.623 --> 51:37.298
And the third
is Jordan Lawrence.

51:37.360 --> 51:39.931
<i>She's a state
Superior Court judge</i>

51:39.996 --> 51:44.877
<i>and former national pageant winner.
Squeaky clean.</i>

51:44.934 --> 51:49.610
Keep digging. Having zero connection
just doesn't make any sense.

51:49.673 --> 51:53.621
And what about Jenkins?
Any further connection?

51:53.677 --> 51:57.853
Possibly, ma'am.

51:57.914 --> 52:00.827
I'll send our guys in
to collect the asset.

52:02.786 --> 52:04.459
Stop the transport.

52:04.521 --> 52:06.865
Damian has got us
by the balls on this one.

52:06.923 --> 52:10.029
We've got no choice
but to play by his rules.

52:10.093 --> 52:11.800
Then let's get a hold
of Captain Ryan,

52:11.861 --> 52:13.568
get him up to speed
about Jenkins.

52:13.630 --> 52:15.769
Maybe we can
do something with that.

52:15.832 --> 52:17.004
And for the love
of fucking God,

52:17.067 --> 52:19.047
get Cutter
back on the phone.

52:21.004 --> 52:22.677
I've never seen
any of those men.

52:22.739 --> 52:24.514
I don't know who any
of these people are.

52:24.574 --> 52:26.747
Well, they know
who you are. Okay'?

52:26.810 --> 52:28.790
It may have been
just a heist gone bad.

52:28.845 --> 52:31.121
It may be something else,
but this is what I can tell you.

52:31.381 --> 52:33.383
They want you dead,
they have your daughter,

52:33.450 --> 52:35.589
and there's
a very real chance

52:35.652 --> 52:37.529
that this could go very bad.
And do you hear me'?

52:37.587 --> 52:39.089
What I need you to do
is be strong,

52:39.356 --> 52:41.768
listen to me,
and you need to stay calm.

52:41.825 --> 52:44.135
Okay, you need to tell me
everything that you know.

52:48.064 --> 52:50.135
This is Cutter.
Cutter.

52:50.400 --> 52:52.141
You're on your own
for the next few hours.

52:52.402 --> 52:54.040
I'm contacting
your captain now.

52:54.104 --> 52:56.448
Letting him know that
under no circumstances

52:56.506 --> 52:58.884
is anyone to meet
Damian's demands.

52:58.942 --> 53:00.717
<i>I understand.</i>

53:20.430 --> 53:22.808
Hey, Don, you want to have
some fun tonight, huh'?

53:27.937 --> 53:29.814
<i>Hey, birdie. Hey, birdie.</i>

53:29.873 --> 53:31.648
<i>Hey, little bird.</i>

53:31.708 --> 53:33.745
What were you doing
taking me Yankee dollars, eh'?

53:33.810 --> 53:35.687
What are you doing
taking me Yankee dollars?

53:35.745 --> 53:37.952
I seen it. You let
that pecker get away.

53:38.014 --> 53:39.823
You tired
of sucking cock, are you'?

53:39.883 --> 53:41.794
You tired of sucking cock?

53:41.851 --> 53:43.091
Take that.

53:43.153 --> 53:44.928
Get down.
You want some cock?

53:44.988 --> 53:47.696
I'm going to piss my lap--
on your fucking face.

53:47.757 --> 53:50.033
You tired
of sucking cock, are you'?

53:50.093 --> 53:51.595
Come here.
Let's piss on you.

53:51.661 --> 53:53.937
Get the fuck off my corner.

53:53.997 --> 53:55.977
Who the fuck are you'?

53:56.032 --> 53:57.636
Just talk away, man.

53:57.700 --> 53:59.145
Look at you,
you filthy bitch.

53:59.202 --> 54:02.945
Who the fuck are you
coming around here?

54:03.006 --> 54:06.146
Fuck off my corner, bitch.

54:06.209 --> 54:08.052
Now, that was
pretty sneaky.

54:08.111 --> 54:10.955
Hey, nobody touches my pimp.

54:12.582 --> 54:15.119
<i>Jesus Chris t! Bitch.</i>

54:15.185 --> 54:17.028
What the fuck
is the matter with you'?

54:19.189 --> 54:21.066
You're some sort of bitch.

54:21.124 --> 54:23.627
You're a fucking bitch.

54:23.693 --> 54:27.573
You fucking stinky cunt.

54:27.630 --> 54:29.667
<i>Yeah, help me, lads.</i>

54:29.732 --> 54:31.609
<i>Chris f.</i>

54:31.668 --> 54:33.614
Jesus Christ.
Yeah, that's right.

54:33.670 --> 54:36.173
They went over there.
They went over there.

54:36.239 --> 54:37.741
You've got the wrong guy.

54:37.807 --> 54:39.787
I was just out for a walk.

54:39.843 --> 54:42.653
<i>!'m not the one.
I was out for a walk, lads.</i>

54:42.712 --> 54:44.055
<i>I was out for a walk.</i>

54:44.113 --> 54:46.923
Come on.
Look, he's getting away.

54:46.983 --> 54:50.021
Settle down.
I'm just taking a walk.

54:50.086 --> 54:52.498
Just out here after the bar.

54:52.555 --> 54:55.502
Come on, she's getting away
right over there.

54:55.558 --> 54:56.935
How did that
work out for you'?

54:56.993 --> 55:00.099
<i>How'd it work out?
You've got the wrong guy.</i>

55:00.163 --> 55:02.837
Come on, lads. I was in there
watching the football game.

55:02.899 --> 55:04.901
I've got a right
to take a walk.

55:11.140 --> 55:12.983
Obviously,
you're okay.

55:13.042 --> 55:16.512
You sure kicked
the fuck out of him.

55:16.579 --> 55:18.923
Yep, and I was just
starting to have fun,

55:18.982 --> 55:20.689
so what's up, Snowden'?

55:20.750 --> 55:23.754
I was just told to bring
you in and give you this.

55:23.786 --> 55:26.232
It must be important.

55:26.289 --> 55:27.825
Better be fucking important.

55:51.214 --> 55:54.218
Damn, Bruno,
that ass is fine.

55:54.250 --> 55:56.696
Hey yo, you ain't hit
that shit, have you'?

55:56.753 --> 55:57.731
Hey look, bro.

55:57.787 --> 55:59.926
I'm going to go
take care of business.

55:59.956 --> 56:01.993
<i>Man, that shit
can wait, dude.</i>

56:02.058 --> 56:03.628
Yo, what's
the fucking hurry'?

56:03.693 --> 56:05.695
Answer
my motherfucking question.

56:05.762 --> 56:08.299
Look, bro, I got my own bitch
at home that needs attention.

56:08.565 --> 56:12.308
Okay, I feel you on that.
I feel you on that.

56:12.569 --> 56:14.048
You don't feel me.

56:14.103 --> 56:15.878
You ain't paying
no attention, bro.

56:15.939 --> 56:17.612
<i>None.</i>

56:17.674 --> 56:19.119
Pay me attention.

56:19.175 --> 56:20.313
That I Will.

56:22.779 --> 56:25.589
Oh, shit.

56:25.648 --> 56:26.956
What's your name'?

56:27.016 --> 56:28.996
Ten minutes, bro.
Ten minutes.

56:29.052 --> 56:31.862
Bro, I think I'm going to need a
little longer than 10 minutes.

56:31.921 --> 56:33.264
<i>Come on, bro,
for real, 10 minutes.</i>

56:35.992 --> 56:37.801
Oh. See you enjoying yourself.

56:37.860 --> 56:39.305
All right.

56:49.238 --> 56:52.242
Hold up, baby,
business.

56:52.308 --> 56:53.616
Hey, chill.

56:56.679 --> 56:58.750
What the fuck
you cops doing here?

56:58.815 --> 57:01.159
Ain't you see we was
having a conversation?

57:01.217 --> 57:03.322
I'm looking
for a piece of shit,

57:03.386 --> 57:06.765
and he looks
just like you, asshole.

57:08.191 --> 57:10.296
Thought all you
cracker motherfuckers

57:10.360 --> 57:13.034
thought all us niggers
looked alike.

57:13.062 --> 57:15.770
Hey, bro, kill that shit.

57:15.798 --> 57:19.302
You think I give a fuck
about what these pigs think'?

57:19.369 --> 57:20.973
He's the toughest guy
in the room.

57:23.272 --> 57:24.751
I didn't do shit.

57:24.807 --> 57:26.252
You're under arrest.

57:26.309 --> 57:28.846
Damn, bro, chill.
He ain't do nothing.

57:28.911 --> 57:30.219
Anybody else want to play'?

57:30.279 --> 57:32.259
<i>Now hang on, man.</i>

57:32.315 --> 57:35.660
You have the right to remain silent.
I didn't <i>'1</i> do shit!

57:35.718 --> 57:37.197
Anything you say can
and will be used--

57:37.220 --> 57:39.166
<i>Man, fuck,</i>
I <i>didn't '1 do shit.</i>

57:39.222 --> 57:42.203
You don't know who y'all fucking with.
I didn't do shit.

57:42.258 --> 57:44.329
You have the right to an attorney.
I didn't do shit.

57:44.394 --> 57:47.000
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you.

57:47.063 --> 57:48.701
Y'all don't know
who you fucking with.

57:48.765 --> 57:50.210
No, man, fuck that shit.

57:50.266 --> 57:52.007
That nigger was
acting a fool anyway.

57:55.038 --> 57:57.245
Yeah, yeah.

57:57.306 --> 57:59.217
Hey, give me my drink.

57:59.275 --> 58:02.222
Fuck, man. I should have
slapped the fuck out of you

58:02.278 --> 58:04.155
for slamming my head
on the table like that.

58:04.213 --> 58:05.749
Dude, we had
to get you out of there.

58:05.815 --> 58:08.125
I had to make it look real.
I was doing you a favor.

58:08.184 --> 58:09.720
I'll remember
that shit next time.

58:09.786 --> 58:11.060
What the fuck
did you pull me for'?

58:11.120 --> 58:12.121
Fuck if I know.

58:12.188 --> 58:14.930
They told me to bring you out
and give you this.

58:15.825 --> 58:16.997
What's in it'?

58:17.060 --> 58:18.903
I don't know.
Read it.

58:18.961 --> 58:20.736
Why you smirking?
Think this shit is funny'?

58:20.797 --> 58:24.438
Yeah, little bit.
What the fuck'?

58:24.701 --> 58:26.009
<i>I don? know
who those men are.</i>

58:26.069 --> 58:28.242
<i>I don'! know who any
of these people are.</i>

58:30.940 --> 58:34.319
Please, just help me
find my daughter, Mikayla.

58:42.752 --> 58:45.426
So, what's going on that you
needed all of us so urgently?

58:45.488 --> 58:49.095
I'm sure you all know about what happened
last night at the Senator's gala.

58:49.158 --> 58:51.729
<i>Well, there's more to it
than you think.</i>

58:51.794 --> 58:55.241
The people behind it were actually
trying to kidnap a scientist.

58:55.298 --> 58:57.244
Dr. Landis,
to be specific.

58:57.300 --> 58:59.974
So, what do we have
to work with so far'?

59:00.036 --> 59:03.074
Not much. They threatened to
kill a hostage every six hours

59:03.139 --> 59:04.914
unless we turn Landis
over to them.

59:04.974 --> 59:06.851
<i>That ain't going to happen.</i>

59:06.909 --> 59:09.321
But we're taking it seriously.

59:09.378 --> 59:13.485
And remember, we do not
negotiate with terrorists.

59:13.750 --> 59:17.220
Fisk, Aubrey, since you guys
have worked undercover,

59:17.286 --> 59:21.496
there's got to be people you can tap
for information. Get that information.

59:21.758 --> 59:25.763
Somebody knows something
about where that heavy artillery came from.

59:25.828 --> 59:27.034
Copy that.

59:27.096 --> 59:28.939
Epps, you go with them.

59:28.998 --> 59:30.944
<i>Lance, you're with me.</i>

59:31.000 --> 59:33.173
You, Cutter, and I are going
to go question Dr. Landis.

59:33.236 --> 59:35.182
We could use
afresh pair of eyes.

59:35.238 --> 59:36.945
Let's move on this.

59:37.006 --> 59:39.452
Oh, fuck.

59:43.379 --> 59:45.222
Those fucking cameras.

59:54.457 --> 59:56.061
I'll willing to cooperate.

59:56.125 --> 59:58.537
I will do anything
you want me to do.

59:58.795 --> 01:00:00.468
I'll tell you
anything you want.

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.075
Whoa!

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:07.443
<i>You done fucking around?</i>

01:00:07.503 --> 01:00:10.848
It's just me.

01:00:10.907 --> 01:00:12.250
Put your fucking weapon down.

01:00:14.443 --> 01:00:16.286
Move your ass.
We got work to do.

01:00:25.321 --> 01:00:27.927
Please, just let me
out of here.

01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:29.492
I need to get my daughter.

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:35.307
So, how is she doing?

01:00:35.364 --> 01:00:37.469
She seems to be
holding up all right.

01:00:37.533 --> 01:00:40.241
She keeps talking
about her kid.

01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:41.577
Anything else?

01:00:41.838 --> 01:00:44.876
<i>Nope, just waiting
on a background check.</i>

01:00:45.408 --> 01:00:47.581
Not a word about what
these guys might want with her'?

01:00:47.844 --> 01:00:49.414
No, sir, she says
she has no idea

01:00:49.478 --> 01:00:51.116
what they could possibly
want with her.

01:00:55.985 --> 01:00:57.328
Hey, flip to Channel 6.

01:01:14.871 --> 01:01:18.284
<i>News Channel 4 has
acquired exclusive security footage</i>

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:21.254
<i>from the attack
at Senator Abrahams' gala</i>

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:24.120
<i>that left several dead
and countless wounded.</i>

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.251
<i>So now we bring you
an inside look</i>

01:01:26.315 --> 01:01:29.421
<i>at the horrors that went on
during the attack.</i>

01:01:29.485 --> 01:01:31.396
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:01:31.454 --> 01:01:33.934
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:36.231
So what does this mean
for the other hostages?

01:01:36.292 --> 01:01:37.896
Nothing good.

01:01:40.196 --> 01:01:41.300
It's him.
This is him.

01:01:41.364 --> 01:01:43.571
Record this, okay'?
Track it.

01:01:43.633 --> 01:01:45.306
<i>This is Cutter.</i>

01:01:47.103 --> 01:01:50.141
Hey, guess who'?

01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:55.083
<i>I assume
you've seen the news.</i>

01:01:55.144 --> 01:01:59.650
Huh'? What was
my first rule, Christopher?

01:01:59.916 --> 01:02:01.623
Listen to me,
don't do that, okay'?

01:02:01.684 --> 01:02:03.220
Look, just give us
some more time.

01:02:03.286 --> 01:02:06.597
What was my first rule'?

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:08.636
You don't need
to hurt anyone, okay'?

01:02:08.691 --> 01:02:11.001
<i>We didn'! break any
of your stupid ass rules.</i>

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:13.199
<i>We're just trying to get
people home safe, okay?</i>

01:02:13.262 --> 01:02:14.673
<i>So, please...</i>

01:02:14.931 --> 01:02:16.706
This is extremely
disappointing.

01:02:16.966 --> 01:02:20.607
Extremely disappointing, because
you're going to have to do better.

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:23.344
Okay'? Look, what you're asking
for is not that easy, okay'?

01:02:23.406 --> 01:02:26.080
If you give me a little
more time, I can do this.

01:02:26.142 --> 01:02:28.088
<i>Hey look,
the rules were very clear.</i>

01:02:28.144 --> 01:02:31.091
They were very clear.

01:02:31.147 --> 01:02:32.626
And this is no lane's fault...

01:02:32.682 --> 01:02:35.561
but yours.

01:02:35.618 --> 01:02:37.325
Now, who should be next'?

01:02:37.386 --> 01:02:40.424
Huh'? The butcher?

01:02:40.489 --> 01:02:42.332
The candlestick maker?

01:02:42.391 --> 01:02:44.496
Or Little Miss Muffet'?

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.631
Huh'? Or you'?

01:02:46.696 --> 01:02:48.334
Nobody else
has to die, okay'?

01:02:48.397 --> 01:02:50.104
Nobody has to die.

01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:51.645
Give me some more time.

01:02:51.701 --> 01:02:54.147
Christopher...

01:02:54.203 --> 01:02:55.238
you're a fuck up.

01:02:56.539 --> 01:02:58.746
Damian, please,
give me some more time.

01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:02.755
We got a lock, sir.

01:03:03.012 --> 01:03:05.117
Kiss my ass.

01:03:37.413 --> 01:03:40.724
Hello, doctor.
I'm Sergeant Kane.

01:03:40.783 --> 01:03:43.730
This is Officer Lance, and I know
you've already met Officer Cutter.

01:03:51.794 --> 01:03:54.673
Nuclear or biological doctor'?

01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:56.368
What'?

01:03:59.168 --> 01:04:00.579
Your specialty, Doctor.

01:04:00.636 --> 01:04:04.049
Nuclear or biological?

01:04:04.106 --> 01:04:08.316
Hey, let me
tell you something.

01:04:08.377 --> 01:04:10.186
I've done this
long enough to know

01:04:10.246 --> 01:04:12.590
that when people with
that kind of heavy artillery

01:04:12.648 --> 01:04:15.686
come after people like you,
people with your pedigree,

01:04:15.751 --> 01:04:18.698
<i>it's always about getting access
to one of two things</i>

01:04:18.754 --> 01:04:20.756
<i>every single time.</i>

01:04:20.823 --> 01:04:23.064
<i>Nuclear or biological weapons.</i>

01:04:24.693 --> 01:04:26.070
So which is it'?

01:04:29.832 --> 01:04:33.803
<i>Biological.
Okay.</i>

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:36.573
But I would never hurt anyone.
I would never hurt a fly.

01:04:36.639 --> 01:04:39.779
So, who are they, and what exactly
could it be they're after'?

01:04:39.842 --> 01:04:41.753
<i>F</i> don't know. What do you
mean you don't know?

01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:43.791
What do you mean
you don't know?

01:04:43.846 --> 01:04:46.349
You understand, somebody is going
to die if you don't talk'?

01:04:46.415 --> 01:04:48.554
Please help us! Cutter,
Cutter, I said that's enough.

01:04:48.617 --> 01:04:51.097
I don't care what you--
You don't care'?

01:04:52.721 --> 01:04:54.428
I said enough.

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:56.299
Yeah, their deaths
are on your head, okay?

01:05:05.201 --> 01:05:06.680
Help me find
my daughter.

01:05:24.487 --> 01:05:26.160
Carrot?

01:05:26.222 --> 01:05:27.792
Aw, the man has
got good eyes.

01:05:27.857 --> 01:05:29.234
Good for you.

01:05:59.688 --> 01:06:03.636
<i>So my boys tell me
you need to talk to me?</i>

01:06:03.692 --> 01:06:06.536
Very convincingly,
I hear.

01:06:06.595 --> 01:06:08.700
Sometimes you got
to make an impression.

01:06:08.764 --> 01:06:13.509
Mm-hmm, yeah, you know, you can
also try doing that with respect.

01:06:13.569 --> 01:06:15.640
Now, you'd better be talking
about a lot of money

01:06:15.704 --> 01:06:18.310
or else I'm going to take
care of all of these people.

01:06:18.374 --> 01:06:19.785
You got it'?

01:06:19.842 --> 01:06:22.755
<i>Respect goes both ways.</i>

01:06:22.811 --> 01:06:26.349
Now, money?
I got that.

01:06:26.415 --> 01:06:29.794
But I'd rather not
talk business with the help.

01:06:29.852 --> 01:06:32.856
Chill, I got this.

01:06:34.723 --> 01:06:37.761
All right, we can
do this privately.

01:06:37.826 --> 01:06:38.896
Jesse,
take them outside.

01:06:47.803 --> 01:06:49.476
Let's step
into my office.

01:06:57.646 --> 01:06:58.920
So, what can
I do you for'?

01:06:58.981 --> 01:07:00.983
Need a little info.

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:03.856
Fancy shindig
got hit last night.

01:07:03.919 --> 01:07:05.728
<i>Big rm.</i>

01:07:05.788 --> 01:07:07.563
Heavy artillery.

01:07:07.623 --> 01:07:09.261
You know anything
about that'?

01:07:09.325 --> 01:07:11.327
Nah, I mean,
I heard about it,

01:07:11.393 --> 01:07:13.999
but I know nothing.

01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:17.342
Hmm.

01:07:17.399 --> 01:07:19.970
So, where they get
their firepower?

01:07:20.236 --> 01:07:21.772
It wasn't me.

01:07:21.804 --> 01:07:23.477
I ain't stupid.

01:07:23.539 --> 01:07:27.783
Ain't messing with crazy
honkies, no mad scientists.

01:07:27.843 --> 01:07:30.790
Well, look, do me a solid.

01:07:30.846 --> 01:07:32.826
<i>Matter of fact,
you know what?</i>

01:07:35.317 --> 01:07:36.921
I'll act like
I didn't see this.

01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:40.957
<i>You should give me a call
if you hear something.</i>

01:07:41.023 --> 01:07:43.025
I'll do that.

01:07:43.292 --> 01:07:45.533
Make sure you do that.

01:07:45.594 --> 01:07:47.631
Oh, hey, Fisk.

01:07:47.696 --> 01:07:50.404
Um, now don't forget.

01:07:50.466 --> 01:07:51.672
If your boys
need anything...

01:07:53.702 --> 01:07:55.409
you know where to come.

01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:59.283
I'll remember that.

01:08:00.809 --> 01:08:02.288
You remember that.

01:08:05.714 --> 01:08:06.954
Kane, talk to me.

01:08:10.919 --> 01:08:12.455
Nice work.

01:08:12.521 --> 01:08:14.467
They were able
to trace the call.

01:08:14.523 --> 01:08:16.696
Team is prepping to move
into the location as we speak.

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:19.899
So it's not about
her daughter now.

01:08:19.962 --> 01:08:21.566
It was unavoidable.

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:25.407
Listen, she's refusing
to cooperate.

01:08:25.466 --> 01:08:27.606
She's pushing to go along
with the team.

01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:30.377
You know it's obviously
out of the question.

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:34.446
Any leverage
for her to talk,

01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:37.787
because you know
we're going in blind.

01:08:37.845 --> 01:08:41.350
No, no, any leverage
we might have had is gone.

01:08:41.417 --> 01:08:42.919
She has no other family.

01:08:42.984 --> 01:08:45.397
We weren't able to put
a lock on the father.

01:08:45.453 --> 01:08:48.332
She's insisting
we turn her over to them.

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:52.861
Mike, an exchange
is out of the question.

01:08:54.395 --> 01:08:56.033
Agreed.

01:08:58.767 --> 01:09:01.645
I hope you and Kane know
what the hell you're doing,

01:09:01.703 --> 01:09:05.777
but I have a summit
I need to prepare for tonight.

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:07.649
I'm leaving this
up to you.

01:09:09.712 --> 01:09:11.350
<i>And Mike?</i>

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:12.916
Don't let me down, huh'?

01:09:58.794 --> 01:10:00.034
Okay.

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:03.103
We just got word

01:10:03.165 --> 01:10:06.476
that the local PD has tracked
Damian's phone and they're on route.

01:10:06.535 --> 01:10:09.778
Damian is too smart to be
traced by a cell phone.

01:10:09.838 --> 01:10:11.909
He doesn't make
mistakes like that.

01:10:15.677 --> 01:10:17.554
All boys in Bravo Team.

01:10:17.613 --> 01:10:19.650
Cover the rear
and side entrances.

01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:22.559
<i>Keeping anyone from leaving
and covering our asses.</i>

01:10:22.618 --> 01:10:24.529
Meanwhile, Team Alpha

01:10:24.586 --> 01:10:26.896
will infiltrate
the main entrance.

01:10:28.791 --> 01:10:30.600
Hi.
Good evening, ma'am.

01:10:33.662 --> 01:10:34.868
You seemed
a little restless.

01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:36.500
When we're all set,

01:10:36.565 --> 01:10:38.101
Bravo will detonate
smoke grenades,

01:10:38.167 --> 01:10:39.840
giving us cover
on the inside.

01:10:43.872 --> 01:10:46.113
Oh, that coffee
is good.

01:10:46.175 --> 01:10:47.984
Cheers.
Cheers.

01:10:49.745 --> 01:10:51.588
Sorry I've been
so upset today.

01:10:51.647 --> 01:10:53.957
Yeah, it's hard being locked
in this room all day.

01:10:54.016 --> 01:10:56.462
I mean, you've been watching
the cameras, right'?

01:10:56.518 --> 01:10:57.997
<i>Yes, that is my job.</i>

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:03.968
Don't you go anywhere.

01:11:07.963 --> 01:11:09.738
Clear!

01:11:09.798 --> 01:11:11.539
Clear!
Clear!

01:11:27.149 --> 01:11:29.151
Place is empty.

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:30.959
We're too late.

01:11:33.989 --> 01:11:35.696
What the fuck
are you doing?

01:11:59.114 --> 01:12:00.684
Son of a bitch.

01:12:45.594 --> 01:12:49.132
Hey, yeah, I just got away
from the officer.

01:12:49.197 --> 01:12:50.733
I'm on my way to you.

01:12:50.799 --> 01:12:52.710
Let me speak to Mikayla.

01:12:52.768 --> 01:12:54.338
Goddamn, they played us.

01:12:55.237 --> 01:12:58.047
<i>No one was ever here. They just
dropped the body of the hostage off.</i>

01:12:58.106 --> 01:13:00.882
The judge, <i>f think.</i> I know he's
given you his list of demands.

01:13:00.943 --> 01:13:02.320
I've heard the tape,

01:13:02.578 --> 01:13:04.922
but with Damian it's never
just about the money.

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:07.824
In my experience, it's always
something more complicated than that.

01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:11.160
He made sure to target the most
high profile people at that event,

01:13:11.219 --> 01:13:15.190
guaranteeing we'd at least
entertain his demands.

01:13:15.257 --> 01:13:16.861
I can only give you
a few hours.

01:13:16.925 --> 01:13:19.269
Then I've got no choice
but to move in.

01:13:36.211 --> 01:13:37.690
John, look at me.
Are you okay'?

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:39.282
John, what happened?

01:13:39.348 --> 01:13:41.760
She-she just--

01:13:41.817 --> 01:13:43.353
Look, stop stuttering.
Talk to me, okay'?

01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:45.064
What happened?
How did she get out'?

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:48.294
Where is she at'? I messed up, all right'?
She got me.

01:13:48.357 --> 01:13:51.804
She came out of nowhere, and she
clocked me with a freaking coffee pot.

01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:54.033
She's-- she's gone. How did
she get a coffee pot'?

01:13:54.096 --> 01:13:56.872
I don't know. We were making coffee earlier.
What is wrong with you'?

01:13:56.932 --> 01:13:59.310
I didn't see her. She came out of nowhere.
She took off.

01:13:59.368 --> 01:14:02.315
How did she get out of the room'? I don't
know, no one was watching the room.

01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:04.214
She just came out. No one
was watching the room'?

01:14:04.272 --> 01:14:06.411
No one was watch--
Do you hear yourself?

01:14:06.675 --> 01:14:08.780
I messed up.
I'm sorry.

01:14:08.844 --> 01:14:11.085
We'll find her.
We'll find her.

01:14:11.146 --> 01:14:12.989
Goddammit!

01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:17.192
Ugh!

01:14:17.252 --> 01:14:20.392
Son of a bitch. We got played.

01:14:20.656 --> 01:14:21.896
Cutter.
Sir, listen to me.

01:14:21.957 --> 01:14:23.368
Dr. Landis
knocked John out.

01:14:23.425 --> 01:14:26.065
She took his car.
I believe she's going to Damian.

01:14:26.094 --> 01:14:28.165
Give me the phone.

01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:30.801
<i>Cutter, there's only
two hostages left.</i>

01:14:30.866 --> 01:14:33.813
That means there's 12 hours
and no bargaining chip.

01:14:33.869 --> 01:14:35.314
Let's move it, okay'?

01:14:38.073 --> 01:14:40.883
Pick up, pick up.

01:14:40.942 --> 01:14:43.354
<i>Listen to me.
Something is not right.</i>

01:14:43.412 --> 01:14:44.948
<i>Some {hing hasn't seemed right.</i>

01:14:45.013 --> 01:14:47.289
Think about it, okay'?
If they took the hostages' phones,

01:14:47.349 --> 01:14:48.953
<i>how did Dr. Landis
get a phone?</i>

01:14:49.017 --> 01:14:50.826
<i>They took them all.
They put them in a bag.</i>

01:14:50.886 --> 01:14:53.389
So, why did Dr. Landis
have a phone?

01:14:53.455 --> 01:14:55.867
Cutter, I've got no choice
but to move in.

01:15:29.224 --> 01:15:32.467
This is Cutter. Did you
find my little package?

01:15:32.728 --> 01:15:34.264
All wrapped up neatly
with a bow'?

01:15:34.329 --> 01:15:36.002
Yeah, I got your package,

01:15:36.064 --> 01:15:37.873
and I'm going to be
seeing you really soon.

01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:40.004
You should know by now
I wouldn't make it that easy for you.

01:15:40.068 --> 01:15:44.915
Listen to me, you sick fuck. Tick took,
tick took, tick took, Christopher.

01:15:44.973 --> 01:15:48.147
Asshole.

01:15:58.153 --> 01:16:00.963
We are tracing the LoJack
system on John's car

01:16:01.022 --> 01:16:02.126
right now as we speak.

01:16:02.190 --> 01:16:03.828
We should have
a lock anytime.

01:16:03.892 --> 01:16:06.065
So get backup ready,
get everybody ready,

01:16:06.128 --> 01:16:08.199
and meet me
at the location.

01:16:10.365 --> 01:16:12.402
Hey. Ready to go'?
Yes, sir.

01:16:12.467 --> 01:16:15.073
Come on, let's get it together
so we can catch our plane.

01:16:15.137 --> 01:16:17.048
<i>Let's go, move. Hurry. Yes, sir.</i>

01:16:21.309 --> 01:16:23.084
<i>Be cool.</i>

01:16:23.145 --> 01:16:25.455
Were you followed?
Huh'?

01:16:25.514 --> 01:16:28.825
No, I made sure of that.

01:16:28.884 --> 01:16:31.330
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:16:33.155 --> 01:16:34.964
Listen to me.

01:16:35.023 --> 01:16:37.833
I don't want no trouble
from you. All right'?

01:16:37.893 --> 01:16:42.035
You so much as breathe a
word I don't like, boom.

01:16:42.097 --> 01:16:43.906
Please, just let me
see my daughter.

01:16:43.965 --> 01:16:46.536
Please, just
let me see my daughter.

01:16:46.802 --> 01:16:48.475
<i>We are a go
to move in on the target.</i>

01:16:48.537 --> 01:16:50.847
<i>Location is three blocks
south of Main Street.</i>

01:16:50.906 --> 01:16:53.147
<i>I repeat,
all units be advised.</i>

01:16:53.208 --> 01:16:55.154
<i>We are a go to move in
on the target.</i>

01:16:55.210 --> 01:16:57.486
<i>Location is three blocks
south of Main Street.</i>

01:16:57.546 --> 01:16:59.958
This is Special Agent
Melanie Hamlin.

01:17:00.015 --> 01:17:03.986
Badge number
Alpha Delta 0735441.

01:17:04.052 --> 01:17:05.531
I'm requesting
immediate air support.

01:17:05.587 --> 01:17:07.362
Tier 3 target's name
is Damian White.

01:17:07.422 --> 01:17:10.369
Be advised that local PD
is already en route.

01:17:29.945 --> 01:17:33.119
Copy that.
Send all available units.

01:17:33.181 --> 01:17:35.923
Lance, look, when we land,
get to higher ground.

01:17:35.984 --> 01:17:36.962
Got it'?

01:17:37.018 --> 01:17:39.294
Get me that
security footage.

01:17:43.225 --> 01:17:44.898
Son of a bitch.

01:17:50.365 --> 01:17:53.107
The video was never
about the fucking demands.

01:17:56.271 --> 01:17:57.545
Stop, stop, stop, fuck.

01:17:58.874 --> 01:18:00.285
It's okay.

01:18:07.916 --> 01:18:09.190
Goddammit.

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:12.192
Here.

01:18:20.128 --> 01:18:20.970
Come on, Lance.

01:18:22.530 --> 01:18:25.306
Stay back here
and provide cover.

01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:26.107
Copy that, sir.

01:18:26.167 --> 01:18:28.511
These motherfuckers
got a sniper.

01:18:29.604 --> 01:18:33.074
We need to get everyone
out of City Hall. Now.

01:18:35.076 --> 01:18:36.384
A bio-weapon'?

01:18:38.013 --> 01:18:39.117
Holy shit.

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:42.695
Come on, Lance,
goddammit, come on.

01:18:42.951 --> 01:18:44.225
Now!

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:26.095
Move, move, move.

01:19:30.298 --> 01:19:31.504
Nick!

01:19:31.566 --> 01:19:33.341
Come on, let's go!

01:19:36.171 --> 01:19:37.172
Let's go.

01:19:39.307 --> 01:19:40.513
I'm on it.

01:19:50.051 --> 01:19:51.553
Move!
Keep running!

01:19:56.224 --> 01:19:57.464
We need to get
that hostage.

01:19:57.525 --> 01:19:59.163
We're fucked.
Got it'?

01:19:59.227 --> 01:20:00.535
Copy that.
Let's go.

01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:18.616
<i>Lance, you see that
shut, you take it, copy.</i>

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:20.682
Cutter, I'm hit.
He shot my scope.

01:20:37.198 --> 01:20:39.337
How you doing?
They're upstairs.

01:20:39.401 --> 01:20:41.381
All right, I got your lead.
Let me lead.

01:20:41.436 --> 01:20:44.417
I'll protect you. That's cute.
I got you.

01:20:57.152 --> 01:20:58.358
Let's go.

01:21:00.588 --> 01:21:02.795
<i>Any sign of Landis?</i>

01:21:36.791 --> 01:21:38.828
Sir! Sir,
are you okay'?

01:21:39.094 --> 01:21:40.767
Don't ever
ask me that again.

01:21:40.829 --> 01:21:41.807
Go.

01:22:03.885 --> 01:22:05.387
Move.

01:22:20.702 --> 01:22:23.273
Exactly what kind of weapon
are you talking about?

01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:24.681
I'm pulling up
the schematics now

01:22:24.706 --> 01:22:25.844
and sending them
over to you.

01:22:29.444 --> 01:22:31.617
<i>I got 100 plus people
in this building.</i>

01:22:31.679 --> 01:22:34.717
That's not enough time
to clear them to a safe perimeter.

01:23:18.526 --> 01:23:19.732
Guy was thick.

01:23:19.761 --> 01:23:20.933
Move!

01:23:27.569 --> 01:23:29.606
I want to thank you

01:23:29.637 --> 01:23:31.742
<i>for being here,
and I know</i>

01:23:31.806 --> 01:23:34.719
<i>exactly what you need to do.</i>

01:23:34.776 --> 01:23:37.689
So, make the right choice.

01:23:37.745 --> 01:23:40.351
Can you pass these
over, please?

01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:43.390
Nick, Nick!

01:23:43.451 --> 01:23:45.761
Put the fucking gun
on the ground right now.

01:23:48.823 --> 01:23:50.496
Want to ask if one
wasn't enough?

01:23:50.558 --> 01:23:52.469
Please give me a reason
to fucking kill you.

01:23:52.527 --> 01:23:54.768
<i>Kane to Cutter,
Damian is on the roof.</i>

01:23:54.829 --> 01:23:56.502
<i>Do you copy?</i>

01:23:56.564 --> 01:23:57.907
I'll handle this.

01:23:57.966 --> 01:23:59.468
Go get Damian.

01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:07.914
Ready for this,
big boy'?

01:24:10.411 --> 01:24:12.914
All right.

01:24:12.981 --> 01:24:14.585
I haven't had
my workout today.

01:24:14.649 --> 01:24:17.528
Huh.
I'll advise you.

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:18.929
Okay.

01:25:13.675 --> 01:25:15.086
Got to cheat, huh'?

01:25:15.343 --> 01:25:16.845
It ain't cheating.

01:25:16.911 --> 01:25:18.584
It's fucked, bitch.

01:25:26.621 --> 01:25:28.328
Yeah! Woo!

01:25:28.389 --> 01:25:30.426
Yeah!

01:25:50.745 --> 01:25:52.486
Who's the bitch now'?

01:26:06.394 --> 01:26:07.896
<i>Kane to One,
I've located the Senator.</i>

01:26:12.667 --> 01:26:14.613
Ladies and gentlemen,
I need your attention.

01:26:14.669 --> 01:26:17.081
I need you to evacuate
the building immediately.

01:26:17.138 --> 01:26:18.947
This is not a drill.

01:26:19.006 --> 01:26:20.644
There's a bomb
in the building.

01:26:20.708 --> 01:26:21.948
Please do not panic.

01:26:22.009 --> 01:26:23.818
Just exit as quickly
as possible.

01:26:23.878 --> 01:26:25.983
Let's go, let's go,
all of you, please.

01:26:26.047 --> 01:26:27.390
<i>Out of the building.</i>

01:26:27.448 --> 01:26:28.586
<i>Right away.</i>

01:26:31.152 --> 01:26:34.827
What the fuck
is going on, Mike?

01:26:34.889 --> 01:26:36.698
What the fuck
is the matter with you'?

01:26:36.758 --> 01:26:38.431
We've got to evacuate
the building.

01:26:38.493 --> 01:26:40.666
Dr. Landis planted
a bio-weapon in here,

01:26:40.728 --> 01:26:42.639
and it's going
to detonate in six minutes.

01:26:42.697 --> 01:26:44.472
Do you understand me'?

01:26:44.532 --> 01:26:46.409
Look, look for the
fucking bomb or get out.

01:26:46.434 --> 01:26:48.539
What'? Find weapon?

01:26:48.569 --> 01:26:51.175
I thought your team had did a
thorough sweep of the building.

01:26:51.439 --> 01:26:52.713
Would you shut up'?

01:26:52.774 --> 01:26:54.117
Obviously not
thorough enough.

01:26:54.175 --> 01:26:56.086
Now, get those people
out of here.

01:26:56.144 --> 01:26:58.454
Call a hazmat unit, and have
them set up a perimeter.

01:26:58.513 --> 01:27:00.720
Senator, please just get
the fuck out of the building.

01:27:00.782 --> 01:27:02.022
Go, go!
There's a bomb in here.

01:27:02.083 --> 01:27:03.824
Your ass!
Get out!

01:27:03.885 --> 01:27:05.558
Your ass!
My ass.

01:27:10.458 --> 01:27:11.664
This has got to be it.

01:27:29.177 --> 01:27:32.124
<i>Hey! Put your gun
on the ground now.</i>

01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:35.593
Motherfucker, I'm going
to kill you. Fuck you.

01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:21.101
Dammit, why can't they
just label this stuff'?

01:28:21.162 --> 01:28:22.573
It would make it
a lot easier.

01:28:27.268 --> 01:28:29.646
All right, here we go.

01:28:38.546 --> 01:28:39.957
All right, I'm doing it.

01:28:43.084 --> 01:28:44.256
Here we go.

01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:54.803
I did it.

01:28:54.862 --> 01:28:57.069
I did it.

01:28:57.098 --> 01:28:59.874
I did shit my pants
but I did it.

01:29:06.541 --> 01:29:07.952
I did it.
I shit my pants.

01:29:24.225 --> 01:29:27.729
It is never easy to say
goodbye to a fellow officer,

01:29:27.795 --> 01:29:30.708
especially someone
I will call a brother.

01:29:30.731 --> 01:29:32.768
<i>I met Sam
during our training</i>

01:29:32.833 --> 01:29:36.576
<i>and watched him grow
info an incredible officer.</i>

01:29:36.637 --> 01:29:39.140
<i>His courage and his strength</i>

01:29:39.206 --> 01:29:42.187
<i>are not to be forgotten.</i>

01:29:42.243 --> 01:29:45.884
Sam, we will never forget you.

01:29:45.947 --> 01:29:49.588
And we will never forget the
sacrifice you made for this city

01:29:49.650 --> 01:29:51.061
<i>and her people.</i>

01:29:52.653 --> 01:29:54.326
<i>God bless your soul</i>

01:29:54.589 --> 01:29:57.195
and I know I'll see you
soon one day again, brother.

01:30:08.869 --> 01:30:09.904
Have a beer.

01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:14.677
You did good, kid.

01:30:14.742 --> 01:30:17.746
Like, I couldn't have done
this without you.

01:30:17.812 --> 01:30:20.656
If there's anything you need at
all, we're here for you, okay'?

01:30:21.616 --> 01:30:23.152
Take care, buddy.

01:30:23.217 --> 01:30:25.026
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:30:25.086 --> 01:30:27.327
Hey, baby, I'm just going
to grab her some tissue.

01:30:27.388 --> 01:30:28.924
She's not doing so good.
Okay.

01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:30.901
Be right back, okay'?
All right.

01:30:30.925 --> 01:30:32.063
You okay, Ms. Hicks?

01:30:33.794 --> 01:30:35.398
I'll make it.
You sure'?

01:30:35.663 --> 01:30:37.700
Thank you.
Come here.

01:30:37.765 --> 01:30:39.938
Why don't you come
have a seat, okay'?

01:30:40.001 --> 01:30:42.174
Get off your feet. It will
do you some good, okay'?

01:30:42.236 --> 01:30:45.149

of the place we hit?</i>

01:31:13.868 --> 01:31:16.212
<i>They're voting
to shutdown my research.</i>

01:31:18.172 --> 01:31:20.152
What the hell they have you
doing out there, huh'?

01:31:20.207 --> 01:31:21.880
Oh, you don't
want to know.

01:31:21.942 --> 01:31:23.216
Believe me.
Oh, I do too.

01:31:25.079 --> 01:31:26.683
Is everything
in order here?

01:31:26.747 --> 01:31:29.694
Such a good performance.

01:31:29.717 --> 01:31:31.697
You almost had me worried

01:31:31.752 --> 01:31:34.096
that somebody actually kidnapped
my precious little girl.

01:31:35.723 --> 01:31:37.396
Are you up for little game'?
