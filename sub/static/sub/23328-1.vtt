01:29.339 --> 01:31.419
Order!

01:33.886 --> 01:36.296
Order! Order!

01:36.805 --> 01:39.845
Mr. Speaker! Mr. Speaker!

01:40.058 --> 01:42.978
Order!
The leader...

01:43.061 --> 01:44.441
Order.

01:44.521 --> 01:47.571
The leader of the Opposition,
Clement Attlee.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.900
Mr. Speaker.

01:50.652 --> 01:54.032
It seems that
I have not been clear enough.

01:55.490 --> 01:58.580
Then let me leave no doubt

01:59.244 --> 02:02.294
about my feelings regarding
Mr. Chamberlain's future

02:02.372 --> 02:03.872
as prime minister.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.207
All right,
honorable gentlemen!

02:06.293 --> 02:09.213
Give way! Give way!

02:09.295 --> 02:10.756
Give way!

02:10.839 --> 02:15.089
Owing to his years of inactivity

02:15.177 --> 02:17.507
and incompetence,

02:17.596 --> 02:21.016
we find him personally responsible...

02:22.476 --> 02:26.476
personally responsible
for leaving this nation

02:26.563 --> 02:29.903
ruinously unprepared
to face the present Nazi peril.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.989
- Order! Order!
- Sit down!

02:37.074 --> 02:39.874
Shame on you! Shame!

02:39.952 --> 02:42.622
We are at war, Mr. Speaker...

02:42.704 --> 02:47.214
at war. And leaving aside
whether he is fit

02:47.292 --> 02:52.382
to be a leader in peacetime,
he has proved himself incapable

02:52.464 --> 02:54.474
of leading us in wartime!

02:55.926 --> 02:57.256
Sit down!

02:58.554 --> 03:00.974
Order! Order!

03:05.227 --> 03:07.267
I said, "Order!"

03:07.354 --> 03:11.654
Therefore, in the national interest,

03:11.984 --> 03:16.114
we, the Opposition,
are willing to enter into

03:16.446 --> 03:20.826
a grand coalition
with the ruling Conservative Party...

03:21.118 --> 03:23.038
so-called...

03:23.120 --> 03:26.120
- Order! Order!
- but not...

03:26.206 --> 03:28.826
and I stress never...
under the leadership

03:28.917 --> 03:30.787
of Mr. Chamberlain, who has lost

03:30.878 --> 03:32.548
the confidence of this House.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.804
In the country's interest, man,

03:36.884 --> 03:41.394
resign, step down,
and let us find a new leader.

03:41.471 --> 03:44.021
Sit down. Shame on you.

03:44.099 --> 03:47.309
- Shame.
- You've got some nerve!

03:47.394 --> 03:49.234
Where's Winston?

03:49.354 --> 03:52.614
Ensuring his fingerprints
are not on the murder weapon.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.570
Order!

03:58.530 --> 04:00.780
As the Opposition refuse

04:00.866 --> 04:03.656
to join any government headed by me,

04:03.744 --> 04:06.254
we must now select my successor,

04:06.330 --> 04:09.210
someone with new strength

04:09.291 --> 04:12.291
to form a coalition government.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.172
I will step down tomorrow,

04:18.216 --> 04:22.007
but, I did want my own party,

04:22.095 --> 04:24.425
the gentlemen I most respect,

04:25.474 --> 04:27.144
to know first.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.105
Yeah.

04:31.647 --> 04:34.187
- And it must be Halifax.
- Hear, hear.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.484
There's no question.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.987
- Our foreign secretary.
- Halifax.

04:38.070 --> 04:39.490
Yeah, of course.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.779
No contest. Halifax.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.076
Thank you, gentlemen.

04:44.159 --> 04:45.553
I appreciate your confidence in me.

04:45.577 --> 04:48.457
However, my time has not yet come.

04:50.332 --> 04:51.582
Then who?

04:51.959 --> 04:54.459
But, on whomever the task may fall,

04:54.545 --> 04:58.135
he shall be required
to explore every avenue.

04:58.215 --> 05:00.725
Including that of diplomatic talks.

05:00.801 --> 05:05.351
Indeed. Towards the restoration
of peace in Europe.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.680
- Absolutely.
- Hear, hear.

05:07.766 --> 05:10.726
Well, gentlemen,
there is only one candidate...

05:10.811 --> 05:14.061
only one man
the Opposition will accept.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.647
- Oh, no. Oh, surely not.
- God, has it come to that?

05:16.733 --> 05:17.903
No, no, no.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.955
No, this is totally absurd.

05:31.415 --> 05:33.045
And if he stretches out his hand

05:33.125 --> 05:34.385
and says, "Gimme,"

05:34.459 --> 05:36.209
you need to anticipate what he wants.

05:36.295 --> 05:38.215
Black pen, red pen, paper

05:38.297 --> 05:40.377
or "clop"... that's his hole punch.

05:41.758 --> 05:44.178
How selfish to resign, time like this.

05:44.261 --> 05:45.363
Do you think they'll take me

05:45.387 --> 05:47.007
to Downing Street if he gets the job?

05:47.097 --> 05:49.467
Not after that spotted dick
you served last week, eh?

05:49.558 --> 05:53.268
He mumbles, so it's almost impossible
to catch everything.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.863
Be prepared to type fast...
short bursts and double-spaced.

05:56.940 --> 05:59.280
He hates single-spaced.
Hates it.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.153
Good luck.

06:22.841 --> 06:25.391
To the French ambassador.

06:28.847 --> 06:31.017
With German forces...

06:32.309 --> 06:34.099
crossing into Holland...

06:34.520 --> 06:36.520
Holland alone...

06:37.022 --> 06:38.442
Come on. Telegram.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.444
Holland alone...

06:41.652 --> 06:44.032
requests reassurance

06:44.821 --> 06:47.821
that French forces will now move...

06:48.242 --> 06:49.912
No, move at once.

06:50.369 --> 06:53.409
Into, to protect Belgium.

06:53.497 --> 06:55.167
Stop.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.839
French ambassador, sir.

07:04.216 --> 07:06.296
Monsieur Ambassador.

07:08.887 --> 07:09.887
Oh.

07:12.558 --> 07:15.138
They've already invaded Belgium?

07:16.186 --> 07:18.726
Holland and Belgium?

07:19.314 --> 07:23.864
I will convey your plea
to the prime minister at once.

07:24.528 --> 07:29.408
Yes. The situation is still very confused.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.752
Yes.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.791
Good-bye.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.958
"To the French ambassador.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.229
- With German..."
- No, scrap that.

07:41.253 --> 07:43.343
New telegram.

07:43.422 --> 07:45.222
To General Ismay.

07:45.299 --> 07:47.009
In...

07:47.092 --> 07:49.182
- What is it now?
- Your son.

07:50.888 --> 07:52.638
Randolph, quickly.

07:54.892 --> 07:56.692
No, last night, they said

07:56.768 --> 07:58.558
I might be made prime minister today,

07:58.645 --> 08:00.725
but that-that was yesterday.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.734
Let's see what happens today.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.146
Yeah? Let's see what,

08:05.235 --> 08:08.065
let's see what Neville does today.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.195
Yes.

08:13.285 --> 08:14.705
Thank you, my boy.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.326
Yes.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.623
Yes. Keep buggering on.

08:22.753 --> 08:24.093
Where, now...

08:24.171 --> 08:25.421
"To General Ismay."

08:25.506 --> 08:27.166
Ah, General Ismay.

08:27.257 --> 08:28.797
Yeah. Sawyers.

08:28.884 --> 08:30.894
Get rid of this, will you?

08:35.890 --> 08:38.020
To General Ismay.

08:39.394 --> 08:42.984
In light of today's events,

08:43.065 --> 08:46.615
the time is ripe...

08:48.445 --> 08:52.365
for many preparations to be...

08:52.449 --> 08:54.449
Are you

08:54.785 --> 08:57.415
striking those keys
in a normal fashion?

08:57.496 --> 09:00.116
It's awfully loud. I can't...
I can't hear myself think.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.417
Read it back.

09:01.959 --> 09:04.339
"To General Ismay.

09:04.419 --> 09:07.009
In the light of today's events,
the time is right..."

09:07.089 --> 09:09.549
"Ripe"! Not "right"!

09:09.633 --> 09:11.553
God's teeth, girl.

09:11.635 --> 09:13.555
I said "ripe"!

09:13.637 --> 09:15.057
Ripe! Ripe!

09:15.138 --> 09:16.308
Last sentence.

09:16.390 --> 09:19.230
"The time is ripe." Puh.

09:19.309 --> 09:20.809
- For...
- "For..."

09:20.894 --> 09:22.944
- For...
- "Man-Many, many, many..."

09:23.021 --> 09:24.441
Many, many, many, many, many.

09:24.523 --> 09:27.363
How many "many" s did you write,
you nincompoop?

09:27.442 --> 09:29.362
One "many." For...

09:29.444 --> 09:33.624
"For many preparations to be made."

09:35.284 --> 09:38.204
Single-spaced. Single-spaced!

09:38.453 --> 09:40.583
Were you not briefed, young lady?

09:40.664 --> 09:41.874
Single-spaced!

09:41.957 --> 09:43.827
Someone set it on single-space, and...

09:43.917 --> 09:45.127
Then why did you persist?

09:45.210 --> 09:47.590
- Well, I...
- Oh, goddamn! Tell...

09:47.671 --> 09:49.211
Tell Evans to send me someone

09:49.298 --> 09:51.878
who can get it right the first time!

09:51.967 --> 09:53.257
Go on! Out!

09:54.011 --> 09:55.221
"Right"!

10:02.477 --> 10:03.767
He shouted at you.

10:03.854 --> 10:05.614
- Did he shout at you?
- No.

10:05.731 --> 10:07.321
- He can be an awful brute!
- I'm...

10:07.399 --> 10:09.729
- I made too many mistakes.
- I think you were nervous,

10:09.818 --> 10:11.462
and he has a knack
for drawing out the very worst

10:11.486 --> 10:12.797
in those who are trying
to help him the most.

10:12.821 --> 10:13.882
No, no, it's not... It's not him.

10:13.906 --> 10:15.026
It's me. He's... he's...

10:15.115 --> 10:17.235
He's a man, like any other.

10:18.619 --> 10:21.159
Come on. What you doing?

10:21.246 --> 10:22.576
Dearest.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.714
The War Cabinet's been called.

10:25.042 --> 10:27.842
- Bloody cat's under the bed again.
- My darling?

10:27.920 --> 10:29.564
- Tango.
- May I tell you something

10:29.588 --> 10:31.258
I feel you really ought to know?

10:34.259 --> 10:38.389
I have noticed a recent
deterioration in your manner.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.642
You're not as kind as you used to be.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.929
You've become rough.

10:43.477 --> 10:45.727
And sarcastic and overbearing and rude.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.482
Oh, is this about the new girl?

10:48.649 --> 10:50.335
If the king does ask you
to become prime minister...

10:50.359 --> 10:51.689
We don't know that for sure.

10:51.777 --> 10:54.197
I don't want you to be disliked.

10:54.279 --> 10:56.159
More than I already am?

10:56.240 --> 11:00.080
My darling, you are on the brink

11:00.160 --> 11:01.950
of having tremendous power,

11:02.037 --> 11:03.437
surpassed only by that of the king,

11:03.497 --> 11:06.827
and with such power
you really must try and be more kind.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.998
And, if possible, calm.

11:13.590 --> 11:17.260
I want others to love
and respect you, as I do.

11:26.562 --> 11:28.232
Telegram for Mr. Churchill.

11:28.313 --> 11:29.863
Excuse me?

11:30.649 --> 11:31.649
I'm not...

11:50.169 --> 11:52.129
...troops have
destroyed all bridges

11:52.212 --> 11:54.802
of the Isle and Meuse rivers.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.882
This is the BBC Home Service.

11:58.594 --> 12:00.724
Here is a short news bulletin.

12:02.264 --> 12:03.814
The German army invaded

12:03.891 --> 12:06.941
Holland and Belgium
early this morning, by land...

12:07.019 --> 12:08.496
- There's a telegram.
- ...and by landings

12:08.520 --> 12:09.940
from parachutes.

12:10.022 --> 12:12.362
The armies of the Low Countries

12:12.441 --> 12:13.781
are resisting.

12:14.359 --> 12:16.109
An appeal for help has been made

12:16.195 --> 12:17.705
to the Allied governments...

12:17.779 --> 12:19.579
- It's from the Palace.
- ...and Brussels says

12:19.656 --> 12:23.076
that Allied troops
are moving to their support.

12:24.036 --> 12:27.576
A hundred war planes
were seen over Brussels,

12:27.664 --> 12:29.544
and it is now reported

12:29.625 --> 12:32.005
that in the first raid over Brussels,

12:32.085 --> 12:35.705
several hundred people
were killed and wounded,

12:35.797 --> 12:38.427
and several buildings destroyed.

12:40.219 --> 12:41.849
Five minutes ago,

12:41.929 --> 12:43.929
the Air Ministry announced

12:44.014 --> 12:46.474
that in the early hours of this morning...

12:46.558 --> 12:49.938
Thank you, Miss?

12:50.437 --> 12:51.807
Layton.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.648
- You're shaking.
- So are you.

12:56.735 --> 13:00.155
You... you from excitement,
I from terror.

13:00.239 --> 13:02.739
You've wanted this your entire adult life.

13:02.824 --> 13:05.794
No. Since the nursery.
But do the public want me?

13:05.869 --> 13:08.139
It's your own party to whom
you'll have to prove yourself.

13:08.163 --> 13:11.423
I'm getting the job only
because the ship is sinking.

13:11.500 --> 13:14.090
It-It's not a gift, it's revenge.

13:14.169 --> 13:16.759
Let them see your true qualities,
your courage.

13:16.839 --> 13:19.009
- My poor judgment.
- No, your lack of vanity.

13:19.091 --> 13:21.091
- And my iron will.
- Your sense of humor.

13:21.176 --> 13:22.506
Ho, ho, ho.

13:23.929 --> 13:25.929
Now go.

13:26.014 --> 13:27.394
- Go?
- Be...

13:27.474 --> 13:28.524
Be what?

13:28.600 --> 13:30.020
Be yourself.

13:32.938 --> 13:34.018
Myself?

13:37.776 --> 13:40.566
Which self should I

13:41.154 --> 13:42.494
be today?

13:44.074 --> 13:46.664
One should have had power
when a young man.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.243
When wits were sharp.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.788
Sinews strong.

13:49.872 --> 13:51.212
Oh, well.

13:51.290 --> 13:53.040
Lead on, Macduff.

13:53.792 --> 13:56.092
When youth departs,

13:56.587 --> 13:59.007
may wisdom prove enough.

14:50.432 --> 14:53.312
Hardly seems like there's a war on at all.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.900
Do you know I've never ridden a bus?

14:58.732 --> 14:59.902
Sir?

15:00.484 --> 15:02.244
I've never queued for bread.

15:03.862 --> 15:06.112
I believe I can boil an egg.

15:06.740 --> 15:08.660
But only because I've seen it done.

15:10.869 --> 15:13.749
The only time I tried
riding the Underground

15:13.830 --> 15:15.670
was during the General Strike.

15:15.749 --> 15:18.959
Clemmie dropped me off
at South Kensington station.

15:19.044 --> 15:21.304
I went down but got lost.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.010
I came straight back up!

15:24.091 --> 15:25.721
It was awful.

15:27.511 --> 15:30.011
Why not Halifax? I favor Halifax.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.427
I wanted Halifax.

15:31.849 --> 15:33.599
The Lords wanted Halifax.

15:34.059 --> 15:36.979
Perhaps, Halifax wanted Halifax.

15:37.271 --> 15:40.651
Then why have I been forced
to send for Churchill?

15:41.441 --> 15:43.651
Because he is the only
member of our party

15:43.735 --> 15:45.695
who has the support of the Opposition.

15:45.779 --> 15:49.159
His record is a litany of catastrophe.

15:49.950 --> 15:52.410
Gallipoli, 25,000 dead,

15:52.494 --> 15:55.084
the India policy, the Russian Civil War,

15:55.372 --> 15:56.752
the Gold Standard,

15:58.292 --> 16:02.252
the abdication
and now this Norway adventure.

16:02.337 --> 16:03.797
What's that, 1,800 men?

16:03.881 --> 16:06.381
One aircraft carrier, two cruisers,

16:06.466 --> 16:08.676
seven destroyers and a submarine.

16:08.760 --> 16:12.220
- Winston lacks judgment.
- He was right about Hitler.

16:12.306 --> 16:15.136
Well, even a stopped clock
is right twice a day.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.189
First Lord of the Admiralty,
Mr. Winston Churchill.

16:22.274 --> 16:23.324
Early.

16:23.567 --> 16:24.567
Keen.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.695
I accept your resignation,

16:31.658 --> 16:33.948
but I want you to know how...

16:34.828 --> 16:36.828
cruelly I think you've been treated.

16:38.332 --> 16:39.922
Thank you, Your Majesty.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.546
Oh, this way, My Lord.

17:24.169 --> 17:25.339
Your Majesty.

17:25.420 --> 17:26.670
Mr. Churchill.

17:27.589 --> 17:29.339
I believe you know

17:31.009 --> 17:33.719
why I have asked you here today.

17:33.804 --> 17:36.474
Sir, I simply cannot imagine why.

17:41.061 --> 17:43.861
It is my duty to invite you

17:43.939 --> 17:46.359
to take up the position of prime minister

17:46.441 --> 17:48.321
of this United Kingdom.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.815
Will you form a government?

17:51.864 --> 17:53.034
I will.

17:53.532 --> 17:54.572
Very well.

18:10.090 --> 18:11.590
Well, that was quite easy.

18:12.968 --> 18:14.298
Yes, it was.

18:19.349 --> 18:23.019
I believe we are to meet regularly.

18:23.896 --> 18:25.356
Once a week, I'm afraid.

18:25.439 --> 18:26.479
How is...

18:28.692 --> 18:30.192
How are you for Mondays?

18:31.111 --> 18:33.531
I shall endeavor to be available

18:33.614 --> 18:35.414
- on Mondays.
- 4:00?

18:35.490 --> 18:37.160
I nap at 4:00.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.162
Is that permissible?

18:41.496 --> 18:43.326
No. But necessary.

18:43.415 --> 18:44.535
I work late.

18:44.625 --> 18:46.635
Then perhaps lunchtime.

18:47.002 --> 18:48.342
Lunch?

18:49.004 --> 18:50.344
Mondays?

18:54.009 --> 18:55.839
Your Majesty.

18:55.928 --> 18:57.178
Prime Minister.

19:23.664 --> 19:25.714
- Can we get any closer?
- Mr. Churchill!

19:26.708 --> 19:29.088
Good evening, gentlemen.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.563
Mr. Churchill, welcome to Number Ten.

19:30.587 --> 19:31.877
Thank you, sir.

19:31.964 --> 19:33.674
Mr. Churchill, what's your agenda?

19:33.757 --> 19:37.297
The agenda? A glass of Pol Roger.

19:37.386 --> 19:39.176
- Cheers.
- Over here, sir!

19:39.263 --> 19:40.643
You'll-you'll have your pictures.

19:40.722 --> 19:42.022
Prime Minister.

19:42.099 --> 19:43.309
Anthony.

19:43.392 --> 19:45.142
How is the king?

19:45.227 --> 19:46.597
Anxious.

19:47.020 --> 19:50.270
He's never forgiven me for supporting

19:50.691 --> 19:53.821
his brother's marriage to Wallis Simpson.

19:53.902 --> 19:55.862
You only have to meet him once a week.

19:55.946 --> 19:57.946
Oh, but that's like saying
you only have to have

19:58.031 --> 20:00.081
your tooth pulled once a week.

20:01.118 --> 20:03.038
Composition of your War Cabinet.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.750
Who should sit on it?

20:04.830 --> 20:05.960
Yeah.

20:06.039 --> 20:08.249
Chamberlain, of course.

20:09.126 --> 20:12.296
The Reverend Holy Fox.

20:12.754 --> 20:14.014
Halifax.

20:14.882 --> 20:16.682
Keeping your enemies close?

20:16.758 --> 20:18.338
Oh, more than that.

20:18.510 --> 20:21.510
Without them, the party
will have rid of me.

20:21.597 --> 20:24.717
Oh, and that sheep
in sheep's clothing, Attlee.

20:25.559 --> 20:27.599
Come on, Daddy. Everyone's waiting.

20:27.686 --> 20:30.516
Yes, I'll be there in a jiffy, my love.

20:31.481 --> 20:33.731
I heard that before you were asked,

20:33.817 --> 20:35.397
they offered it to Lord Halifax.

20:35.485 --> 20:36.855
Oh, I doubt that.

20:37.154 --> 20:39.824
Halifax would never turn it down.

20:39.907 --> 20:42.487
He's the fourth son of an earl.

20:42.576 --> 20:44.366
Fourth sons turn nothing down.

20:46.205 --> 20:49.295
I wish the position had come
your way in better times, sir.

20:50.751 --> 20:52.311
You have an enormous task ahead of you.

20:52.377 --> 20:54.667
I only hope it's not too late.

20:55.214 --> 20:57.594
I'm very much afraid it is.

20:58.926 --> 21:01.136
But we can only do our best, hmm?

21:01.345 --> 21:04.395
- Hip hip!
- Hurray!

21:04.473 --> 21:05.643
Oh, heavens!

21:05.724 --> 21:07.644
What a frightful sight.

21:07.726 --> 21:09.766
- A toast.
- Yes, a speech.

21:10.145 --> 21:11.895
- Yes.
- Mama.

21:13.482 --> 21:14.692
Yes.

21:14.775 --> 21:16.995
My darling husband.

21:17.069 --> 21:20.109
Some of you may not know that on the eve

21:20.197 --> 21:22.447
of our marriage, I got cold feet.

21:22.533 --> 21:25.333
But as I'd already
called off two engagements

21:25.410 --> 21:27.170
by the age of 21
and was in danger of gaining

21:27.204 --> 21:28.544
a reputation for being a bolter

21:28.622 --> 21:30.122
it would have been poor form

21:30.207 --> 21:31.957
- to call off a third.
- Hear, hear.

21:32.042 --> 21:33.382
Lucky for Daddy.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.710
But the real reason for my wintery feet

21:35.796 --> 21:38.466
was that I knew, even then,

21:39.091 --> 21:41.301
that his priority would be public life.

21:42.803 --> 21:44.197
But it worried a young girl greatly,

21:44.221 --> 21:46.641
this wretched thought
of eternally coming second.

21:47.266 --> 21:48.926
But so it has proven to be.

21:49.476 --> 21:52.596
And in due course, our children
would have to make their peace

21:52.688 --> 21:54.058
with this same fact.

21:56.900 --> 21:58.280
We all did, you see.

21:58.861 --> 22:00.201
In our own way.

22:03.365 --> 22:08.285
And now, today,
we are to receive our reward.

22:09.288 --> 22:11.458
Proof that our small sacrifice

22:11.540 --> 22:13.710
was for a far, far greater good.

22:15.335 --> 22:17.295
I give you your father,

22:18.213 --> 22:22.263
my beloved husband, the Prime Minister.

22:23.177 --> 22:24.467
The Prime Minister.

22:25.012 --> 22:26.642
Here's to,

22:29.308 --> 22:31.728
to not buggering it up.

22:31.810 --> 22:33.730
To not buggering it up.

22:35.189 --> 22:37.019
Belgium was a ploy.

22:37.524 --> 22:40.194
They punched through
the Ardennes into France.

22:40.277 --> 22:43.237
Crossed the Meuse River in under 24 hours.

22:43.322 --> 22:45.242
No one can cross the Meuse in 24 hours.

22:45.324 --> 22:46.744
Well, apparently the Germans can.

23:21.485 --> 23:23.115
Look to Chamberlain's handkerchief.

23:23.195 --> 23:25.865
If he waves it
at the end of Churchill's speech,

23:25.948 --> 23:27.368
we show approval.

23:28.742 --> 23:31.332
If not, keep quiet.

23:32.412 --> 23:34.462
The Prime Minister.

23:44.967 --> 23:46.297
Here we go.

23:49.179 --> 23:50.679
Mr. Speaker,

23:51.682 --> 23:54.602
on Friday evening last,

23:54.893 --> 23:58.103
I received His Majesty's commission

23:58.188 --> 24:01.018
to form a new administration.

24:02.401 --> 24:05.321
It was the evident wish and will

24:05.404 --> 24:08.414
of Parliament and the nation

24:08.490 --> 24:13.700
that this should be conceived
on the broadest possible basis.

24:13.787 --> 24:16.537
And that it should include all parties.

24:16.623 --> 24:18.083
Hear, hear.

24:19.501 --> 24:22.381
A War Cabinet has been convened.

24:22.462 --> 24:26.222
No. Correction.

24:26.300 --> 24:28.180
Has been formed.

24:30.095 --> 24:31.095
"Formed."

24:31.555 --> 24:35.735
A War Cabinet has been formed
of five members

24:35.809 --> 24:39.149
representing, with the Opposition parties,

24:39.730 --> 24:41.440
the unity of the nation.

24:44.026 --> 24:45.316
Read.

24:45.694 --> 24:47.172
"The three
party leaders have agreed

24:47.196 --> 24:48.946
"to serve either in the War Cabinet

24:49.031 --> 24:51.621
"or in high executive office."

24:51.700 --> 24:54.660
With this agreement in place,

24:54.745 --> 24:56.915
I now invite the House

24:56.997 --> 25:00.667
by the resolution which
stands in my name...

25:01.084 --> 25:04.094
...to record its approval

25:04.588 --> 25:07.918
and to declare its confidence

25:08.008 --> 25:09.338
in the new government.

25:12.554 --> 25:13.684
Miss?

25:14.473 --> 25:17.313
I'm coming out in a state of nature.

25:23.899 --> 25:25.319
It must be remembered

25:26.068 --> 25:28.778
that we are in the preliminary stage

25:28.862 --> 25:32.622
of one of the greatest battles in history.

25:33.075 --> 25:37.625
And that many preparations
have to be made here at home.

25:37.704 --> 25:39.084
Hear, hear.

25:39.164 --> 25:41.544
Sir, I take up my task

25:41.625 --> 25:44.635
with a buoyancy and hope,

25:45.045 --> 25:48.545
and say to the House, as I have said

25:48.632 --> 25:50.512
to those who have joined the government,

25:51.009 --> 25:54.009
I have nothing to offer

25:54.221 --> 25:58.731
but blood, toil, tears and sweat.

26:00.894 --> 26:05.324
We have before us an ordeal
of the most grievous kind.

26:06.233 --> 26:09.573
We have before us many, many long months

26:09.653 --> 26:12.283
of struggle and of suffering.

26:12.948 --> 26:16.118
You ask, "What is our policy?"

26:17.369 --> 26:19.619
I say it is to wage war

26:19.705 --> 26:23.335
by sea, land and air

26:23.417 --> 26:25.167
with all our might

26:25.627 --> 26:29.797
and with all the strength
that God can give us.

26:30.465 --> 26:36.255
To wage war against a monstrous tyranny

26:36.430 --> 26:39.850
never surpassed
in the dark and lamentable catalog

26:39.933 --> 26:41.483
of human crime.

26:41.560 --> 26:44.980
That is our policy.

26:45.689 --> 26:48.479
Oh, you ask, "What is our aim?"

26:49.193 --> 26:52.243
I can answer in one word.

26:53.614 --> 26:54.994
Victory.

26:55.073 --> 26:57.533
Victory at all costs.

26:58.243 --> 27:01.373
Victory, in spite of all terror.

27:01.455 --> 27:06.465
Victory, however long and hard
the road may be.

27:07.044 --> 27:09.554
For without victory,

27:10.005 --> 27:13.215
there can be no survival.

27:29.691 --> 27:30.691
What's he doing?

27:39.535 --> 27:40.875
Contempt.

27:41.370 --> 27:43.290
We have to start somewhere.

27:44.498 --> 27:45.538
Snap.

27:54.216 --> 27:57.216
"Our policy is to wage war.

27:57.636 --> 27:59.136
"At all costs.

27:59.221 --> 28:00.891
"No survival."

28:00.973 --> 28:02.183
Good God, he's incapable

28:02.266 --> 28:04.886
of even pronouncing the word "peace,"

28:05.143 --> 28:07.483
let alone entering into negotiations.

28:08.564 --> 28:10.824
Awful, the thought that I shall never see

28:10.899 --> 28:12.819
my country at peace again.

28:16.446 --> 28:17.736
I have cancer.

28:22.870 --> 28:23.910
Oh, Neville.

28:29.751 --> 28:32.131
Winston must be removed from office.

28:32.212 --> 28:34.512
If we can get him
to declare that he refuses

28:34.590 --> 28:37.090
to even consider peace
negotiations with Germany,

28:37.176 --> 28:40.096
you and I would perhaps
have clear grounds to resign.

28:41.180 --> 28:43.560
That would force
a vote of no confidence.

28:43.640 --> 28:45.480
The party couldn't countenance that.

28:45.559 --> 28:47.309
You're the chairman, for heaven's sake.

28:48.312 --> 28:49.352
He'd be finished.

28:49.438 --> 28:52.068
And you would agree to be prime minister.

28:52.816 --> 28:54.226
Well...

28:55.485 --> 28:57.695
with Winston out of the way,
who can say?

28:57.779 --> 29:00.029
But the important thing, Neville,

29:00.115 --> 29:03.575
is that your policies
would be back on the table.

29:03.660 --> 29:06.250
Peace and the protection of our nation.

29:06.330 --> 29:07.750
On record.

29:08.081 --> 29:09.171
I beg your pardon.

29:09.249 --> 29:10.419
He must declare, on record,

29:10.501 --> 29:13.881
his refusal to engage in peace talks.

29:14.379 --> 29:16.379
We must have it in writing.

29:56.088 --> 29:57.418
Thank you.

29:59.341 --> 30:00.931
- Miss Layton.
- Morning.

30:01.051 --> 30:02.391
Follow me.

30:16.024 --> 30:17.154
Morning.

30:17.234 --> 30:18.784
Thank you, sir.

30:20.112 --> 30:21.492
Thank you, ma'am.

30:23.574 --> 30:25.204
What goes on down here?

30:25.284 --> 30:28.204
That's need-to-know, and you don't.

30:28.287 --> 30:30.657
- The lavatory?
- For the PM's use only.

30:31.623 --> 30:32.753
Sleeping quarters,

30:32.833 --> 30:34.833
for when you miss the last train.

30:36.545 --> 30:37.555
Ma'am.

30:39.923 --> 30:41.803
That's the Map Room.

30:42.426 --> 30:44.756
- No women allowed.
- What department's this?

30:44.845 --> 30:47.015
Indiscretion in conversation
or any other form,

30:47.097 --> 30:49.117
within or without these rooms
regarding what happens here,

30:49.141 --> 30:51.771
is a statutory offense punishable by up to

30:51.852 --> 30:54.192
two years imprisonment with hard labor.

30:54.855 --> 30:56.115
Clear?

30:56.190 --> 30:57.360
Crystal.

30:57.441 --> 30:58.481
Good.

30:59.902 --> 31:01.572
That's the War Cabinet room.

31:01.987 --> 31:03.147
Never.

31:04.865 --> 31:07.665
I don't mean to be rough on you, but

31:08.243 --> 31:09.873
them's the rules.

31:11.205 --> 31:13.255
This is the typists' pool.

31:13.373 --> 31:15.503
- Good morning, sir.
- Ladies.

31:17.294 --> 31:18.844
And here's you.

31:26.678 --> 31:29.098
Belgium and Holland may fall at any hour.

31:29.181 --> 31:30.561
And the French?

31:30.641 --> 31:32.061
The entire French Ninth Army,

31:32.142 --> 31:34.732
some 200,000 men, have capitulated.

31:35.437 --> 31:36.437
All of them?

31:36.522 --> 31:37.692
Capitulated.

31:37.773 --> 31:39.693
Deserted. It was a rout.

31:39.775 --> 31:42.655
All our land forces,
roughly 300,000 men,

31:42.736 --> 31:44.066
are now in full retreat.

31:44.530 --> 31:46.610
Air cover? For our troops?

31:46.698 --> 31:48.578
The Luftwaffe control the skies.

31:48.659 --> 31:51.119
We simply don't have enough
planes to challenge them.

31:51.203 --> 31:53.413
In fact, I strongly
recommend we stop sending

31:53.497 --> 31:56.367
our precious fighter planes
to be wasted in France.

31:56.458 --> 31:58.288
Save them for our own defense.

31:58.502 --> 32:01.342
And our navy sits idle,

32:01.421 --> 32:03.591
neutralized, useless.

32:03.674 --> 32:06.134
Our fleets no sooner
come within their range

32:06.218 --> 32:08.178
than we come under blistering air attack.

32:08.262 --> 32:12.312
Well, their speed is devastating.

32:12.391 --> 32:15.641
Panzer tanks moving rapidly westward
through the center.

32:15.727 --> 32:19.807
Well, they will have to pause
for fuel supplies.

32:19.898 --> 32:21.478
This is not the last war, sir.

32:21.567 --> 32:24.487
Their tanks can stop for fuel
at a petrol station.

32:25.696 --> 32:27.156
Petrol station?

32:27.239 --> 32:29.739
The road to Paris now lies open.

32:29.825 --> 32:32.165
Seven million refugees are on the move.

32:33.745 --> 32:35.575
Collectively, we are looking
at the collapse

32:35.664 --> 32:37.964
of Western Europe in the next few days.

32:38.041 --> 32:40.421
Should the public be told?

32:46.717 --> 32:48.087
Not yet.

32:48.844 --> 32:51.474
First, we must rouse our old friends

32:51.555 --> 32:54.145
to a heroic resistance.

32:55.142 --> 32:57.942
France must be saved.

34:03.168 --> 34:04.588
Premier.

34:30.987 --> 34:33.818
Perhaps, in English, Prime Minister.

34:34.241 --> 34:35.451
Well...

34:35.534 --> 34:40.043
We have survived crises before,

34:40.121 --> 34:43.962
and I am... I am confident
we will survive this one.

34:44.042 --> 34:47.422
Tell me how you plan to counter-attack.

34:49.297 --> 34:50.588
There is no plan.

34:52.342 --> 34:54.512
Well...

34:54.636 --> 34:56.545
Well, you must counter-attack.

34:57.181 --> 34:59.181
Well, you must.

35:07.941 --> 35:11.741
I do not
believe that this,

35:12.112 --> 35:15.372
Panzer breakthrough is a real invasion.

35:15.449 --> 35:17.409
Not a real invasion?

35:17.492 --> 35:20.752
No. As long as their tank crews
are not supported

35:20.829 --> 35:23.619
by infantry units, they are

35:24.249 --> 35:27.749
merely little flags stuck on a map.

35:27.836 --> 35:31.166
Because the tank crews
cannot support themselves.

35:31.256 --> 35:33.426
No. I refuse to see,

35:33.509 --> 35:36.799
in this spectacular raid
of the German tank,

35:37.095 --> 35:39.005
a real invasion.

35:51.485 --> 35:52.995
He's an actor,

35:53.070 --> 35:55.200
in love with the sound of his own voice.

35:55.280 --> 35:57.320
I love to listen to him.

35:57.783 --> 35:59.873
But we must never take his advice.

36:00.285 --> 36:02.195
Has a hundred ideas a day.

36:02.287 --> 36:03.747
Four of them are good,

36:04.122 --> 36:06.082
the other 96 downright dangerous.

36:06.166 --> 36:10.086
His father was the same.
Great orator, but...

36:10.170 --> 36:11.960
Until he lost his mind to syphilis.

36:12.381 --> 36:15.471
How nations suffer
for the sins of their fathers.

36:15.551 --> 36:16.761
My opinion?

36:16.844 --> 36:19.394
At this critical juncture for the empire,

36:20.305 --> 36:23.015
we have a drunkard at the wheel.

36:23.392 --> 36:25.482
Wakes with a scotch,

36:25.769 --> 36:28.479
bottle of champagne for lunch,

36:28.564 --> 36:30.154
another one at dinner.

36:30.983 --> 36:33.783
Brandy and port until the wee hours.

36:34.528 --> 36:36.698
I wouldn't let him borrow my bicycle.

36:36.780 --> 36:39.620
He's a Conservative
who defects to the Liberals,

36:39.700 --> 36:42.240
lobs grenades at us for ten years,

36:42.327 --> 36:45.957
then flops Conservative again
as it bloody suits him.

36:46.039 --> 36:49.169
Sorry, but he stands for one thing.

36:49.334 --> 36:50.504
Himself.

36:51.503 --> 36:53.673
We may have to replace him, Bertie.

36:55.132 --> 36:56.422
Replace him?

36:57.050 --> 36:58.930
We must strive for peace

36:59.469 --> 37:01.599
so that every
son and daughter of this land

37:01.680 --> 37:03.260
can emerge from this crisis

37:03.348 --> 37:05.558
with something recognizable as home.

37:07.352 --> 37:09.602
Spoken like a true prime minister.

37:24.745 --> 37:26.915
"V for Victory."

37:28.582 --> 37:31.212
You need to reply to the Lord Privy Seal.

37:34.546 --> 37:38.466
Tell the Lord Privy Seal
I am sealed in the privy.

37:39.676 --> 37:42.796
And I can only deal
with one shit at a time.

37:50.145 --> 37:54.145
The broadcast is tonight,
so don't spare me, Anthony.

37:54.525 --> 37:55.785
Be frank.

38:04.076 --> 38:05.696
I don't think so.

38:06.036 --> 38:07.946
You don't think so what?

38:08.247 --> 38:10.497
You're suggesting we're somehow winning.

38:10.916 --> 38:12.166
We're not.

38:13.001 --> 38:16.631
No, but it will inspire them.

38:17.130 --> 38:19.170
- Winston, I know...
- Anthony, Anthony.

38:19.258 --> 38:22.638
I am going to imbue them with a...

38:22.719 --> 38:26.889
a spirit of feeling
they don't yet know they have.

38:26.974 --> 38:28.314
You asked my opinion.

38:29.518 --> 38:31.268
I caution against it.

38:33.814 --> 38:34.814
Cicero.

38:37.359 --> 38:39.069
Cicero!

38:41.405 --> 38:45.785
"If fortune is adverse..." something,

38:45.868 --> 38:48.198
something, something.

38:53.917 --> 38:55.207
Well...

38:55.711 --> 38:58.801
Well, it's not there. I left it there.

38:58.881 --> 39:00.471
Clemmie!

39:01.091 --> 39:02.381
Cat!

39:02.467 --> 39:03.637
Clemmie!

39:03.719 --> 39:04.929
We cannot pay our bills.

39:05.012 --> 39:07.602
My copy of Cicero.

39:07.973 --> 39:09.450
- Did-did you shelve it?
- Did you hear what I said?

39:09.474 --> 39:10.814
- What was that?
- We're broke.

39:12.936 --> 39:14.556
Oh, um... Out! Out.

39:14.646 --> 39:16.396
Come on. Everybody out.

39:17.441 --> 39:19.111
I dare not write another check.

39:20.360 --> 39:21.990
Well, I'll economize.

39:22.237 --> 39:24.737
Only four cigars a day.

39:24.823 --> 39:26.703
You are insufferable!

39:30.913 --> 39:32.253
Is there anything else?

39:32.956 --> 39:34.246
Yes.

39:34.333 --> 39:35.463
My love for you.

39:36.418 --> 39:38.138
How much have you had
to drink this morning?

39:40.088 --> 39:41.878
I see you now

39:42.799 --> 39:44.879
as I first saw you

39:45.093 --> 39:47.763
in 1904.

39:47.846 --> 39:50.266
And I simply stood, speechless.

39:50.349 --> 39:51.829
Well, I must have been very beautiful

39:51.892 --> 39:53.272
to achieve that miraculous effect.

39:53.352 --> 39:56.022
Four years until we saw each other again.

39:56.104 --> 39:57.314
Went by in an absolute flash.

39:57.397 --> 39:59.267
You didn't lack for admirers.

39:59.358 --> 40:03.488
Your fidele serviteur in Sidney Peel.

40:03.570 --> 40:05.360
- Brilliant man.
- Lionel Earle.

40:05.447 --> 40:07.407
Wonderful dancer.

40:08.575 --> 40:11.195
And then at
Lady St. Helier's dinner party.

40:11.662 --> 40:13.412
Who should show up?

40:14.581 --> 40:15.711
Pig.

40:18.252 --> 40:19.502
Just the same.

40:30.639 --> 40:32.059
Are we terribly old?

40:33.183 --> 40:34.353
Yes, I'm afraid you are.

40:35.018 --> 40:36.558
Oh, you beast.

40:36.645 --> 40:38.735
Oh, you...

40:41.441 --> 40:44.111
Would you hear me read my speech

40:44.194 --> 40:45.824
for tonight's broadcast?

40:46.947 --> 40:48.157
Prime Minister.

40:48.240 --> 40:49.717
Prime Minister, the situation in France.

40:49.741 --> 40:51.951
Is it true we're in full retreat?

40:52.035 --> 40:53.655
Is France lost?

41:00.878 --> 41:03.548
"The Spanish ships I cannot see,

41:03.630 --> 41:05.300
"for they are out of sight."

41:06.091 --> 41:07.971
If you will sit here

41:08.802 --> 41:10.432
at your desk.

41:12.264 --> 41:14.684
And speak slowly and clearly.

41:15.851 --> 41:17.061
Into the microphone.

41:17.895 --> 41:18.905
So...

41:19.396 --> 41:22.646
if you're ready, on the stroke of 9:00,

41:22.733 --> 41:24.483
the red light will come on,

41:24.568 --> 41:26.648
and we shall go live to the nation.

41:28.906 --> 41:31.156
9:00, red light...

41:32.492 --> 41:33.992
you begin.

41:34.077 --> 41:35.407
Yes?

41:36.371 --> 41:37.371
One moment.

41:44.796 --> 41:47.376
Prime Minister, are we ready?

41:47.466 --> 41:51.046
One moment, one moment.

41:56.725 --> 41:58.765
We are going live...

41:58.852 --> 42:00.402
One moment, damn you!

42:07.236 --> 42:10.606
And four, three,

42:11.031 --> 42:12.951
two, one.

42:33.720 --> 42:36.770
I speak to you for the first time

42:36.849 --> 42:38.679
as prime minister

42:39.351 --> 42:43.811
in a solemn hour
for the life of our country,

42:44.690 --> 42:48.230
of our empire, of our allies

42:48.861 --> 42:52.611
and, above all, of the cause of freedom.

42:53.949 --> 42:55.699
A tremendous battle

42:55.784 --> 42:59.454
is raging in France and Flanders.

43:01.039 --> 43:04.829
The Germans, by a remarkable combination

43:05.419 --> 43:09.299
of air bombing and heavily armored tanks,

43:10.007 --> 43:12.757
have broken through the French defenses

43:12.843 --> 43:15.723
north of the Maginot Line

43:16.013 --> 43:17.473
and strong columns

43:17.556 --> 43:18.926
of their armored vehicles

43:19.016 --> 43:21.886
are ravaging the open country...

43:23.187 --> 43:25.107
...which, for the first day or two,

43:25.230 --> 43:27.270
was without defenders.

43:28.317 --> 43:33.697
However, I have invincible confidence

43:34.114 --> 43:37.744
in the French Army and its leaders.

43:37.826 --> 43:40.946
Only a very small part
of that splendid army

43:41.038 --> 43:43.418
has yet been heavily engaged,

43:43.498 --> 43:48.958
and only a very small part
of France has yet been invaded.

43:49.463 --> 43:50.923
Side by side,

43:51.465 --> 43:55.265
the British and French peoples
have advanced.

43:55.344 --> 43:58.474
- "Advanced"?
- To rescue not only Europe.

43:58.555 --> 44:01.635
- How bloody dare he.
- But mankind

44:01.725 --> 44:06.395
from the foulest and most
soul-destroying tyranny

44:06.563 --> 44:09.023
which has ever darkened

44:09.107 --> 44:11.937
and stained the pages of history.

44:12.528 --> 44:16.198
But now one bond unites us all.

44:16.782 --> 44:21.162
To wage war until victory is won,

44:21.245 --> 44:24.295
and never to surrender ourselves

44:24.915 --> 44:28.045
to servitude and shame.

44:28.126 --> 44:29.706
Whatever the cost

44:31.296 --> 44:32.956
and the agony may be,

44:33.674 --> 44:36.134
conquer we must,

44:36.802 --> 44:39.602
as conquer we shall.

44:46.353 --> 44:47.603
Well done, sir.

45:54.213 --> 45:57.303
Oh! I thought you did marvelously.

45:58.050 --> 45:59.470
The last ten years,

45:59.551 --> 46:01.891
I was the only one
who told them the truth.

46:02.471 --> 46:03.971
Until tonight.

46:05.682 --> 46:07.272
There is no advance.

46:09.603 --> 46:11.233
It's a shambles.

46:12.272 --> 46:14.362
We're in full retreat.

46:16.527 --> 46:18.027
But would you be serving them tonight

46:18.111 --> 46:19.701
by denying them their sleep

46:19.780 --> 46:21.660
and terrifying their children?

46:22.157 --> 46:24.027
What, even if the terror is coming?

46:24.117 --> 46:25.907
Because the terror is coming.

46:27.621 --> 46:29.581
There's time enough for the truth.

46:39.591 --> 46:41.221
Have you seen this?

46:45.222 --> 46:47.182
What's so funny?

46:48.559 --> 46:50.639
Prime Minister. Sir.

46:50.727 --> 46:51.977
Yes, what is it?

46:53.522 --> 46:54.812
Perhaps...

46:58.360 --> 46:59.690
Look, I'm...

46:59.778 --> 47:02.028
I'm not sure if you know this, but,

47:03.156 --> 47:05.236
but the way you're doing
your "V for Victory" sign...

47:06.994 --> 47:09.164
Well, in the poorer quarters,

47:09.454 --> 47:10.964
that gesture means something else.

47:11.039 --> 47:12.499
What does it mean?

47:12.583 --> 47:14.043
Well, I wouldn't like to say, sir.

47:14.126 --> 47:16.416
I was captured by the Boer.

47:16.503 --> 47:18.963
I spent time in a South African prison.

47:19.590 --> 47:20.630
Up your bum.

47:22.009 --> 47:23.049
Sir.

47:23.760 --> 47:25.430
Up your bum?

47:26.096 --> 47:27.136
Up your...

47:30.058 --> 47:32.688
The way you're doing it, sir, yes, sir.

47:34.062 --> 47:36.362
But if you turn it around, that's fine.

47:38.275 --> 47:39.905
I wouldn't like millions of people

47:39.985 --> 47:41.155
to take it the wrong way.

47:41.236 --> 47:42.606
Indeed.

47:43.238 --> 47:44.698
- Sir.
- Sir.

47:45.616 --> 47:48.906
And up your bum!

47:49.036 --> 47:50.116
Your Majesty.

47:50.621 --> 47:52.831
Don't want to take
too much of your time.

47:53.457 --> 47:55.377
I heard you on the wireless.

47:56.543 --> 47:58.253
Was I comprehensible?

47:59.296 --> 48:03.216
The public need to be led, not misled.

48:03.300 --> 48:06.010
Not left to work it out for themselves.

48:09.806 --> 48:11.016
Right.

48:11.391 --> 48:13.391
Will that be all, Your Majesty?

48:13.644 --> 48:14.644
Yes.

48:14.728 --> 48:16.148
Good day, Prime Minister.

48:16.230 --> 48:17.440
Good day.

48:20.943 --> 48:25.163
I believe I have just received
a royal rap on the knuckles.

48:31.662 --> 48:33.372
As of 20:00 hours last night,

48:33.455 --> 48:36.825
the Germans have encircled 60 British,

48:36.917 --> 48:38.997
Belgian and French divisions.

48:40.212 --> 48:43.972
On our part, all our forces
under Lord Gort have withdrawn

48:44.049 --> 48:47.009
or are trying to withdraw
to the French coast, to Dunkirk,

48:47.344 --> 48:49.144
where we cannot reach them.

48:49.221 --> 48:50.851
How many of our men are trapped?

48:50.931 --> 48:52.311
All of them.

48:52.766 --> 48:55.266
Our country's entire
professional soldiery.

48:55.686 --> 48:58.056
And we can see no clear way
to rescue them.

49:01.608 --> 49:04.238
General, are you telling me

49:04.319 --> 49:08.369
that we shall have lost
the entire British Army

49:08.448 --> 49:09.988
by the next few days?

49:10.993 --> 49:12.083
That's correct.

49:12.828 --> 49:16.158
The German force
is superior in every regard

49:16.248 --> 49:18.208
and only 50 miles from the coast.

49:18.292 --> 49:20.502
They are pushing us into the sea.

49:20.586 --> 49:23.956
No, the Germans must not reach the sea.

49:24.423 --> 49:27.843
Not before we evacuate our men.

49:27.926 --> 49:29.836
Ismay, what have you got for us?

49:29.928 --> 49:31.258
As it stands, I cannot see

49:31.346 --> 49:35.056
we have much hope of getting
any of our forces out in time.

49:36.727 --> 49:38.307
Not a man?

49:39.771 --> 49:42.441
Well, we... Well, we cannot be so

49:42.691 --> 49:44.191
totally at their mercy.

49:44.276 --> 49:45.816
What's our next step?

49:46.695 --> 49:47.985
Anyone?

49:49.072 --> 49:50.162
Come on, speak!

49:53.327 --> 49:54.721
We still have a garrison at Calais.

49:54.745 --> 49:56.005
25 miles to the west.

49:56.079 --> 49:57.659
Well, how many men do we have there?

49:57.748 --> 49:59.078
4,000, more or less.

50:01.793 --> 50:04.213
Then why... Why didn't you say so?

50:05.255 --> 50:08.585
Yes. Then we... We have them go east,

50:08.675 --> 50:11.045
engage with the German columns
moving on Dunkirk,

50:11.136 --> 50:12.296
buy us some time.

50:12.387 --> 50:14.967
Draw the... the Nazi focus

50:15.057 --> 50:17.887
away from Dunkirk whilst we execute a...

50:17.976 --> 50:20.346
a maritime evacuation of our forces.

50:20.437 --> 50:21.897
Is that possible?

50:21.980 --> 50:23.360
It would mean a huge sacrifice.

50:23.440 --> 50:25.360
4,000 young men.

50:25.442 --> 50:28.402
To save 300,000.

50:28.487 --> 50:31.107
Under whose command
is the Calais garrison?

50:31.198 --> 50:32.568
Brigadier Nicholson.

50:32.658 --> 50:33.908
Very well.

50:35.536 --> 50:37.406
Tell Nicholson it is
of the greatest importance

50:37.496 --> 50:39.206
to this island that...

50:39.289 --> 50:42.379
that his garrison draw the enemy's tanks

50:42.459 --> 50:44.669
and artillery and bombers
away from Dunkirk.

50:44.753 --> 50:46.923
Invite their wrath, and...

50:48.674 --> 50:50.184
Well, and to fight on

50:51.510 --> 50:52.970
if needs be.

50:56.682 --> 51:00.392
If needs be,
until the destruction of his command.

51:03.105 --> 51:04.775
It's suicide.

51:16.577 --> 51:20.287
Prime Minister, I have reservations.

51:20.914 --> 51:23.464
Well, who is free of reservations?

51:23.917 --> 51:25.747
About unnecessary sacrifice,

51:26.211 --> 51:27.801
when there is an available alternative.

51:29.423 --> 51:30.763
What alternative?

51:31.550 --> 51:33.640
Italy has offered to mediate peace talks

51:34.178 --> 51:35.598
between ourselves and Germany.

51:35.679 --> 51:36.929
I already indicated that,

51:37.014 --> 51:38.366
provided the liberty and independence

51:38.390 --> 51:39.970
of the British Empire was assured,

51:40.559 --> 51:42.479
we would consider any proposal.

51:42.561 --> 51:47.321
With, with Hitler holding the whip hand.

51:47.399 --> 51:49.029
Do you really think he would honor

51:49.109 --> 51:50.319
our liberty and independence?

51:50.694 --> 51:52.744
It would be in his interest to do so, sir.

51:53.113 --> 51:55.243
- Because the British Empire...
- The only thing to do

51:55.324 --> 51:58.244
is to show that maniac

51:58.327 --> 52:00.367
that he cannot conquer this island,

52:00.454 --> 52:02.084
and for that we need an army.

52:02.164 --> 52:03.474
General, tell Brigadier Nicholson

52:03.498 --> 52:04.958
the Germans must not reach the sea.

52:05.042 --> 52:07.922
Not before we-we get our boys

52:08.003 --> 52:10.053
off of that bloody beach!

52:10.130 --> 52:11.920
I take full responsibility.

52:12.007 --> 52:13.257
Really?

52:13.342 --> 52:15.262
Really! Yes, sir.

52:15.344 --> 52:16.724
It is the reason

52:16.803 --> 52:19.223
I sit in this chair!

52:22.434 --> 52:23.984
Well, surely, before you take

52:24.061 --> 52:26.731
full responsibility
for the deaths of 4,000 men,

52:26.813 --> 52:30.113
you'd wish to consider
every available avenue.

52:32.569 --> 52:34.859
What is this?

52:36.323 --> 52:39.203
What is your mind
on the principle of peace talks, sir?

52:43.038 --> 52:46.168
Do we take it, for example,
that you preclude yourself

52:46.250 --> 52:49.790
from even considering
taking part in such negotiations?

53:09.690 --> 53:13.440
I should like to speak to Viscount Halifax

53:13.527 --> 53:15.357
and Mr. Chamberlain.

53:16.071 --> 53:17.321
Alone.

53:18.156 --> 53:20.986
Issue the order to the Calais garrison.

53:21.910 --> 53:23.580
Confirm it has been done.

53:24.037 --> 53:25.327
Dismissed.

53:27.207 --> 53:28.747
Now, you two come on.

53:28.834 --> 53:30.044
Out.

53:32.129 --> 53:33.169
Bridges!

53:33.255 --> 53:34.885
You come on, hop it!

53:34.965 --> 53:36.475
Out. Out!

54:45.369 --> 54:46.659
Winston,

54:47.913 --> 54:50.333
we are facing certain defeat on land,

54:50.999 --> 54:55.049
the annihilation of our army,
and imminent invasion.

54:55.879 --> 54:57.629
We must be rational.

54:57.714 --> 55:00.554
We are a seagoing nation.

55:00.634 --> 55:03.854
Have been since the Bronze Age.

55:04.680 --> 55:06.430
The Channel is ours.

55:06.515 --> 55:09.395
It's our moat, our battlement,

55:09.476 --> 55:12.096
and the German doesn't
recognize an expanse of water

55:12.187 --> 55:14.107
greater than a bloody lake.

55:14.231 --> 55:17.781
They have first to reach
this island, Edward.

55:17.860 --> 55:19.530
Where men, women and children,

55:19.611 --> 55:21.611
whom we will have failed despicably

55:21.697 --> 55:23.657
in our duty of protection, will be

55:23.740 --> 55:25.760
- entirely defenseless...
- And whose fault is that?

55:25.784 --> 55:28.754
...against the largest army
the world has ever seen.

55:28.829 --> 55:30.459
Furthermore, once France falls,

55:30.539 --> 55:33.329
Germany can concentrate
on aircraft production.

55:33.417 --> 55:35.787
They will then have
the French fleet as well.

55:35.878 --> 55:38.338
What is to stop
Herr Hitler then, Winston?

55:38.422 --> 55:41.802
Words, words, words alone.

55:43.760 --> 55:45.930
If you will not permit any talk of peace,

55:46.013 --> 55:47.223
then I shall be forced...

55:47.306 --> 55:49.096
Might we not allow Edward

55:49.183 --> 55:52.943
simply to meet the
Italian Ambassador Bastianini,

55:53.020 --> 55:55.270
discuss a possible role

55:55.355 --> 55:58.685
as mediators between us and Germany,

56:00.068 --> 56:01.358
and find out their price?

56:18.212 --> 56:19.302
Sir.

56:39.650 --> 56:42.190
- Mr. President.
- Winston.

56:42.277 --> 56:43.947
Franklin.

56:44.154 --> 56:47.374
- How are you?
- Fine. Fine.

56:47.449 --> 56:49.119
How are you, Prime Minister?

56:49.451 --> 56:51.241
Oh, I'm in fine fettle.

56:51.370 --> 56:52.500
Fine fettle.

56:52.579 --> 56:54.459
Listen.

56:54.748 --> 56:59.628
I'm, telephoning about your navy ships.

56:59.711 --> 57:02.171
If you could loan us just,

57:02.923 --> 57:05.593
50 older destroyers.

57:05.676 --> 57:08.846
- Ah, yes.
- Or even 40 would do.

57:09.471 --> 57:11.141
Well, I,

57:11.223 --> 57:13.063
I did ask around,

57:13.559 --> 57:16.689
but just not possible, I'm afraid.

57:16.979 --> 57:21.649
The Neutrality Act we signed
last year has tied my hands.

57:21.733 --> 57:23.323
Just can't swing it.

57:23.694 --> 57:24.784
I tried.

57:24.862 --> 57:26.572
Well, can I...

57:28.532 --> 57:32.412
Do I have your permission

57:32.494 --> 57:35.164
to send an aircraft carrier

57:35.247 --> 57:37.167
to pick up the P-40 fighter planes

57:37.249 --> 57:38.669
we purchased from you?

57:42.588 --> 57:44.168
Mr. President?

57:44.965 --> 57:47.135
Well, you've got me there again.

57:47.217 --> 57:49.757
New law preventing transshipment

57:49.845 --> 57:51.685
of military equipment.

57:51.763 --> 57:53.933
But we paid for them.

57:54.224 --> 57:56.814
We paid for them with the money that we...

57:56.894 --> 57:58.604
that we borrowed from you.

57:58.812 --> 58:01.942
I'm so, so sorry, Winston.

58:06.361 --> 58:09.701
I need not impress upon you the...

58:10.365 --> 58:14.615
the trouble faced
by the Western Hemisphere,

58:15.787 --> 58:19.917
without your support in some fashion.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.840
I know. I know.

58:21.919 --> 58:24.709
You are on my mind day and night.

58:27.007 --> 58:30.587
Look, we could possibly...

58:30.677 --> 58:32.637
Mr. President...

58:32.721 --> 58:34.391
I mean to say...

58:34.473 --> 58:39.893
We are facing the gravest odds.

58:39.978 --> 58:41.398
We could take your planes

58:41.480 --> 58:44.020
to about a mile from the Canadian border.

58:44.900 --> 58:46.740
And then, if you send across

58:46.818 --> 58:51.408
a team of horses from Canada,
nothing motorized

58:51.490 --> 58:54.330
then you could pull them
over the border yourself.

58:56.203 --> 58:58.203
How does that sound?

59:01.416 --> 59:02.746
Horses?

59:04.294 --> 59:06.714
You did say,

59:06.797 --> 59:09.297
a team of horses?

59:09.800 --> 59:12.760
Well, I guess you could
push them yourself.

59:13.387 --> 59:15.387
Damn things have wheels.

59:18.350 --> 59:19.480
Up to you.

59:23.146 --> 59:25.816
We could do that, Prime Minister.

59:29.486 --> 59:30.696
Prime Minister?

59:34.700 --> 59:37.580
Anything you could do at this time,

59:37.661 --> 59:39.661
Franklin, would be most welcome.

59:40.789 --> 59:42.829
Good night to you, Winston.

59:43.208 --> 59:45.338
It must be late there.

59:46.295 --> 59:51.225
In more ways than you could possibly know.

01:00:25.542 --> 01:00:28.342
- Prime Minister.
- Prime Minister.

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:39.470
Get me Admiral Ramsay
on one of these, will you?

01:00:39.556 --> 01:00:41.806
Yes, Prime Minister.

01:00:42.309 --> 01:00:44.519
Put me through to Admiral Ramsay.

01:01:03.497 --> 01:01:05.077
Admiral Ramsay.

01:01:05.165 --> 01:01:06.995
It's the prime minister.

01:01:08.126 --> 01:01:09.376
Bertie?

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:13.300
Bertie, I hope I didn't wake you.

01:01:13.382 --> 01:01:16.132
Not at all. I was just reading the Bible.

01:01:16.218 --> 01:01:18.178
Exodus?

01:01:19.096 --> 01:01:20.676
Listen, Bertie.

01:01:21.139 --> 01:01:23.479
We need to evacuate our boys.

01:01:23.559 --> 01:01:26.729
The Navy is saying that with one cruiser

01:01:26.812 --> 01:01:28.652
and six destroyers and with the...

01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:31.730
the Luftwaffe controlling the skies above,

01:01:31.817 --> 01:01:33.777
we'll be lucky to get ten percent out.

01:01:34.111 --> 01:01:38.781
I want you to order an assembly of boats.

01:01:40.492 --> 01:01:41.952
Boats?

01:01:42.035 --> 01:01:43.325
Yes.

01:01:43.412 --> 01:01:45.412
Civilian boats.

01:01:45.497 --> 01:01:48.537
As many as you can get your hands on.

01:01:48.625 --> 01:01:51.625
Longley's Clipper,
Fearnley's Gin Palace,

01:01:51.712 --> 01:01:54.132
anyone with a pleasure craft
bigger than 30 foot

01:01:54.214 --> 01:01:55.634
that can get to France.

01:01:58.135 --> 01:01:59.935
Bertie, you still there?

01:02:00.762 --> 01:02:02.182
Um... Right.

01:02:04.099 --> 01:02:07.309
Help me stage this thing, Bertie?

01:02:07.895 --> 01:02:11.945
We must at least try to bring
some of our boys home.

01:02:13.192 --> 01:02:15.322
Well, I'll have the BBC issue the order.

01:02:15.736 --> 01:02:16.946
Good.

01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:19.569
Oh, and Bertie, you still there?

01:02:20.699 --> 01:02:23.029
- Sir.
- We need a name

01:02:23.827 --> 01:02:25.117
for this operation.

01:02:28.248 --> 01:02:30.059
Good morning, Prime Minister.
Prime Minister, do you have

01:02:30.083 --> 01:02:31.478
anything you'd like to say
to our readers this morning?

01:02:31.502 --> 01:02:33.212
Prime Minister. Mr. Churchill, sir.

01:02:33.295 --> 01:02:34.898
Prime Minister, do you have
anything you'd like to say?

01:02:34.922 --> 01:02:37.012
Prime Minister?
Prime Minister, are you going to...

01:02:37.090 --> 01:02:39.130
Prime Minister, would you like to...
Prime Minister?

01:02:46.683 --> 01:02:49.143
How do you manage drinking during the day?

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:54.610
Practice.

01:03:13.043 --> 01:03:14.043
I...

01:03:15.087 --> 01:03:16.797
should like to discuss...

01:03:17.005 --> 01:03:20.295
I have been asked if plans should be drawn

01:03:20.384 --> 01:03:24.974
to evacuate myself
and my family to Canada.

01:03:26.098 --> 01:03:28.728
I would like to know
the opinion of our prime minister.

01:03:30.602 --> 01:03:32.482
Well, my opinion would be that you must do

01:03:32.563 --> 01:03:34.813
what you feel is right for yourself,

01:03:35.691 --> 01:03:38.691
your family and the nation.

01:03:40.028 --> 01:03:42.448
I mean, your survival is paramount.

01:03:43.699 --> 01:03:45.529
Prime ministers...

01:03:45.617 --> 01:03:48.867
well, we seem to come and go
at an astonishing rate.

01:03:49.288 --> 01:03:52.328
Your position in Parliament, I...

01:03:53.083 --> 01:03:55.423
I'm told, is not strong.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:58.420
My party

01:03:59.464 --> 01:04:05.224
resents the way
Chamberlain was pushed aside.

01:04:05.304 --> 01:04:06.934
And many others doubt me.

01:04:07.347 --> 01:04:08.847
They want Halifax still,

01:04:08.932 --> 01:04:11.062
but why get rid of the organ grinder

01:04:11.143 --> 01:04:12.643
and replace him with the monkey?

01:04:12.728 --> 01:04:15.938
Lord Halifax is
a close personal friend of mine.

01:04:21.695 --> 01:04:23.565
I am unwanted.

01:04:26.158 --> 01:04:29.788
I've never been trusted
since the Gallipoli campaign.

01:04:31.205 --> 01:04:32.545
Unwanted.

01:04:33.248 --> 01:04:35.418
Perhaps it's because you scare people.

01:04:35.876 --> 01:04:37.036
Who?

01:04:37.127 --> 01:04:38.207
You scare me.

01:04:39.338 --> 01:04:40.708
What nonsense.

01:04:42.841 --> 01:04:46.091
What could possibly be scary about me?

01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:49.220
One never knows what's going
to come out of your mouth next.

01:04:49.306 --> 01:04:51.016
Something that will flatter,

01:04:51.099 --> 01:04:52.979
something that will wound.

01:04:58.106 --> 01:05:01.736
My emotions are unbridled.

01:05:03.570 --> 01:05:05.990
A wildness in the blood

01:05:06.073 --> 01:05:09.533
I share with my father.

01:05:10.536 --> 01:05:12.696
And my mother also.

01:05:13.539 --> 01:05:16.459
We lacked the gift of temperance.

01:05:18.877 --> 01:05:20.337
Were you close to your parents?

01:05:20.629 --> 01:05:24.219
My mother was glamorous,

01:05:25.592 --> 01:05:28.092
but perhaps too widely loved.

01:05:29.555 --> 01:05:32.475
My father was like God,

01:05:33.058 --> 01:05:34.558
busy elsewhere.

01:05:35.853 --> 01:05:36.853
Hmm.

01:06:18.437 --> 01:06:19.997
- Good day, gentlemen.
- Prime Minister.

01:06:20.022 --> 01:06:25.692
I have asked the minister for war
to join us.

01:06:25.944 --> 01:06:28.454
Neville, would you...

01:06:28.572 --> 01:06:29.862
Anthony.

01:06:32.034 --> 01:06:36.794
Obviously, we are
in a dangerous situation.

01:06:37.164 --> 01:06:39.544
But I am assured by the French premier

01:06:39.625 --> 01:06:42.635
that while some German tank units

01:06:42.711 --> 01:06:44.751
have reached the sea,

01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:47.880
the situation generally seems
to be well in hand.

01:06:47.966 --> 01:06:50.546
What news from Calais?

01:06:50.636 --> 01:06:52.506
The garrison attacked, but was forced back

01:06:52.596 --> 01:06:54.556
and is now surrounded on all sides.

01:06:55.557 --> 01:06:57.887
They're being shelled
and bombed mercilessly.

01:06:58.310 --> 01:06:59.980
Casualties are at 60%.

01:07:04.024 --> 01:07:05.034
Hmm.

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:12.740
Prime Minister.

01:07:13.492 --> 01:07:14.952
The question of peace talks.

01:07:15.994 --> 01:07:17.834
We must hold our nerve.

01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:23.000
Signal only that we intend
to fight it out until the end.

01:07:23.418 --> 01:07:25.248
A peace offer

01:07:25.379 --> 01:07:27.169
- telegraphs our weakness.
- Agreed.

01:07:27.256 --> 01:07:29.666
And even if we were beaten,
we should be no worse off

01:07:29.758 --> 01:07:32.218
than we should be if we were
now to abandon the struggle.

01:07:32.803 --> 01:07:34.513
Let us therefore avoid

01:07:34.596 --> 01:07:37.886
being dragged down the slippery slope

01:07:37.975 --> 01:07:40.105
with talk of a negotiated peace.

01:07:40.185 --> 01:07:42.265
Slippery slope? The only...

01:07:42.354 --> 01:07:45.574
- I suspect Italy and Germany...
- The only slippery slope...

01:07:45.649 --> 01:07:48.229
...wish to get us so deeply
involved in negotiations

01:07:48.318 --> 01:07:51.198
- that we should be unable to turn back.
- Nonsense.

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:53.320
- Bastianini informed me...
- I propose...

01:07:53.407 --> 01:07:55.807
- The only slippery slope...
- Would you stop interrupting me

01:07:55.868 --> 01:07:57.828
while I am interrupting you?

01:08:01.874 --> 01:08:04.254
When I chose my War Cabinet,
I took great care

01:08:04.334 --> 01:08:06.964
to surround myself with old rivals.

01:08:08.172 --> 01:08:09.592
I may have overdone it.

01:08:10.465 --> 01:08:12.045
Viscount Halifax,

01:08:12.384 --> 01:08:16.104
the approach you propose is...
It's not only...

01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:17.760
It's futile.

01:08:18.307 --> 01:08:20.477
But it involves us in a deadly danger.

01:08:20.559 --> 01:08:22.189
The deadly danger here

01:08:22.269 --> 01:08:26.689
is this romantic fantasy
of fighting to the end.

01:08:28.442 --> 01:08:29.902
What is the end,

01:08:30.319 --> 01:08:33.198
if not the destruction of all things?

01:08:34.113 --> 01:08:35.283
There's nothing heroic

01:08:35.365 --> 01:08:37.575
in going down fighting
if it can be avoided.

01:08:37.658 --> 01:08:41.118
Nothing even remotely patriotic
in death or glory

01:08:41.205 --> 01:08:43.335
if the odds are firmly on the former.

01:08:43.415 --> 01:08:46.785
Nothing inglorious
in trying to shorten a war

01:08:46.877 --> 01:08:48.287
that we are clearly losing.

01:08:48.377 --> 01:08:50.917
Losing? Europe is still...

01:08:51.006 --> 01:08:52.376
Europe is lost.

01:08:59.515 --> 01:09:02.895
And before our forces
are wiped out completely,

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:05.560
now is the time to negotiate,

01:09:05.645 --> 01:09:08.566
in order to obtain
the best conditions possible.

01:09:10.567 --> 01:09:12.737
Hitler will not insist on
outrageous terms.

01:09:12.819 --> 01:09:14.109
He will know his own weaknesses.

01:09:14.196 --> 01:09:15.696
He will be reasonable.

01:09:15.781 --> 01:09:17.911
When will the lesson be learned?

01:09:18.283 --> 01:09:20.743
When will the lesson be learned?

01:09:22.162 --> 01:09:24.462
How many more dictators

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:28.000
must be, wooed, appeased,

01:09:28.085 --> 01:09:30.055
good God, given immense privileges

01:09:30.127 --> 01:09:32.008
before we learn?

01:09:32.381 --> 01:09:35.381
You cannot reason with a tiger

01:09:35.466 --> 01:09:38.006
when your head is in its mouth!

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.010
Prime Minister.

01:09:42.099 --> 01:09:44.099
Winston. Winston.

01:09:45.394 --> 01:09:46.662
Yesterday, you gave permission...

01:09:46.687 --> 01:09:48.057
What permission?

01:09:48.145 --> 01:09:49.935
For me to meet Bastianini.

01:09:50.023 --> 01:09:51.703
I sanctioned
the theoretical exploration...

01:09:51.774 --> 01:09:52.774
Theoretical?

01:09:52.859 --> 01:09:55.110
...of what price Italy would ask.
Nothing more.

01:09:55.195 --> 01:09:57.215
- I did not sanction any...
- If you will not permit

01:09:57.239 --> 01:09:59.159
further exploration of a peace agreement,

01:09:59.241 --> 01:10:00.701
then you will have my resignation.

01:10:00.784 --> 01:10:02.414
Don't be absurd, Edward.

01:10:02.494 --> 01:10:05.834
- I need you. You know I do.
- I will not stand by

01:10:05.914 --> 01:10:09.174
to watch another generation
of young men die

01:10:09.251 --> 01:10:10.881
at the bloody altar of your hubris.

01:10:10.961 --> 01:10:13.591
Oh, and you would have us die as lambs!

01:10:13.672 --> 01:10:15.222
Was Gallipoli not enough for you?

01:10:15.299 --> 01:10:16.799
How dare you!

01:10:17.217 --> 01:10:21.007
Our troops were chewing
barbed wire in Flanders,

01:10:21.096 --> 01:10:22.506
and I saw it!

01:10:23.348 --> 01:10:26.728
Opening a second front,
outflanking the Turks

01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:29.190
was a serious military idea,

01:10:29.271 --> 01:10:31.231
and it could have
damn well worked if the...

01:10:31.315 --> 01:10:33.275
if the admirals and the First Sea Lord

01:10:33.358 --> 01:10:36.438
hadn't dithered away
our element of surprise.

01:10:40.908 --> 01:10:42.368
Choice is yours, Winston.

01:10:42.826 --> 01:10:45.036
You have 24 hours
to enter into peace talks,

01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.410
or I shall resign.

01:11:01.094 --> 01:11:02.434
I told him.

01:11:02.888 --> 01:11:04.348
It shook him.

01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:06.520
I imagine it did.

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.480
Gave him 24 hours.

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:11.650
I don't expect he'll agree,
so I shall resign first.

01:11:11.730 --> 01:11:13.690
You then follow, that's critical if we're

01:11:13.774 --> 01:11:15.864
to trigger a vote
of no confidence in the House.

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:17.740
I shall announce it.

01:11:19.696 --> 01:11:21.196
The king will back us.

01:11:37.589 --> 01:11:38.879
Prime Minister.

01:11:38.966 --> 01:11:40.336
I wonder if we might schedule you

01:11:40.425 --> 01:11:41.585
to address the Outer Cabinet.

01:11:43.762 --> 01:11:45.365
Today, the Admiralty

01:11:45.389 --> 01:11:47.519
have made an order requesting all owners

01:11:47.599 --> 01:11:49.019
of self-propelled pleasure craft

01:11:49.101 --> 01:11:51.691
between 30 and 100 feet in length

01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:55.020
to send all particulars
to the Admiralty immediately...

01:11:55.107 --> 01:11:57.107
To Brigadier Nicholson.

01:12:00.237 --> 01:12:04.367
30 Infantry Brigade, Calais.

01:12:07.411 --> 01:12:08.831
Every hour

01:12:09.872 --> 01:12:12.172
you continue to exist

01:12:13.375 --> 01:12:15.415
is of the greatest help

01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:19.010
to our forces at Dunkirk.

01:12:22.009 --> 01:12:26.719
Have the greatest possible admiration

01:12:27.681 --> 01:12:29.681
for your splendid stand.

01:12:35.022 --> 01:12:37.112
Your evacuation, however,

01:12:37.858 --> 01:12:40.398
will not take place.

01:12:46.158 --> 01:12:47.738
I repeat,

01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:51.790
will not take place.

01:13:00.255 --> 01:13:01.375
Sign.

01:13:16.688 --> 01:13:18.728
Here. Here.

01:13:22.277 --> 01:13:23.647
May I be excused?

01:13:24.029 --> 01:13:25.199
You may not.

01:13:27.157 --> 01:13:28.947
What is this about?

01:13:31.537 --> 01:13:33.197
No one tells us anything.

01:13:35.082 --> 01:13:36.922
It's all classified.

01:13:38.669 --> 01:13:41.669
We hear scraps,
and it's worse than knowing nothing.

01:13:46.468 --> 01:13:48.218
What would you like to know?

01:13:56.019 --> 01:13:58.479
How many men will survive?

01:14:05.445 --> 01:14:06.735
Come with me.

01:14:15.205 --> 01:14:16.785
I'm not allowed in the Map Room.

01:14:16.874 --> 01:14:18.424
- Well, you are now.
- Prime Minister.

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:21.090
At ease, gentlemen.

01:14:22.796 --> 01:14:24.006
Now...

01:14:27.301 --> 01:14:29.841
The German army controls every French port

01:14:29.928 --> 01:14:32.388
except Dunkirk here
and Calais here to the west,

01:14:32.472 --> 01:14:35.062
where the garrison
under Brigadier Nicholson

01:14:35.142 --> 01:14:39.272
is drawing fire and delaying
the German advance on Dunkirk.

01:14:39.354 --> 01:14:42.944
At both points, our troops are encircled.

01:14:43.025 --> 01:14:45.035
Now, we are still trying

01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:47.610
to clear Dunkirk Harbor of wrecked ships

01:14:47.696 --> 01:14:50.486
so that we can then land
the boats we need to get

01:14:50.574 --> 01:14:52.034
our boys off those beaches.

01:14:52.117 --> 01:14:54.987
But enemy aircraft
is attacking us constantly.

01:14:55.078 --> 01:14:59.668
Our only hope in Dunkirk
is thick cloud cover

01:14:59.917 --> 01:15:02.997
to thwart these attacks,
but the skies remain clear.

01:15:03.587 --> 01:15:07.837
And even then, I am told
we will need a...

01:15:07.925 --> 01:15:11.395
a miracle to get even
ten percent of our men out.

01:15:14.515 --> 01:15:16.895
Courage, Miss Layton.

01:15:18.018 --> 01:15:19.308
Courage.

01:15:19.937 --> 01:15:21.187
General.

01:15:21.647 --> 01:15:23.937
How long have they got

01:15:25.275 --> 01:15:26.815
if we don't rescue them?

01:15:29.947 --> 01:15:32.657
One, maybe

01:15:33.784 --> 01:15:35.294
two days.

01:15:40.916 --> 01:15:43.496
News from Calais, the 30th Infantry, sir.

01:15:43.585 --> 01:15:45.455
They've retreated to the town's citadel

01:15:45.546 --> 01:15:48.166
as a last and probably hopeless stand.

01:15:48.257 --> 01:15:50.927
The order, "every man
for himself," has been given.

01:15:51.009 --> 01:15:52.445
- Thank you, thank you.
- Brigadier Nicholson.

01:15:52.469 --> 01:15:54.389
- There's a telegram, sir.
- Thank you.

01:15:59.685 --> 01:16:00.855
Good show, chaps.

01:16:00.936 --> 01:16:03.396
Well done, lads. Well done.

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:04.980
All right.

01:16:08.610 --> 01:16:10.400
He's losing too much blood.

01:16:10.487 --> 01:16:12.697
We need another transfusion here.

01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:20.040
All right, men? All right?

01:16:33.051 --> 01:16:35.641
Your evacuation, however,

01:16:36.054 --> 01:16:38.604
will not take place.

01:16:40.517 --> 01:16:43.767
I repeat, will not take place.

01:17:30.817 --> 01:17:32.397
Go to bed, Pig.

01:17:34.238 --> 01:17:35.948
You must sleep.

01:17:38.492 --> 01:17:40.452
Leave me, Clemmie.

01:17:41.119 --> 01:17:43.999
The opportunity for doing so
passed a long time ago.

01:18:15.571 --> 01:18:17.491
Operator.
How may I direct your call?

01:18:17.573 --> 01:18:20.623
- Give me Ramsay.
- One moment, please.

01:18:21.994 --> 01:18:23.874
- Bertie?
- Sir?

01:18:24.079 --> 01:18:25.409
What's been the response?

01:18:25.497 --> 01:18:26.917
It will take time.

01:18:26.999 --> 01:18:28.289
It's too soon to judge.

01:18:28.375 --> 01:18:29.825
How many boats so far?

01:18:29.918 --> 01:18:31.878
Winston, it will take time.

01:18:31.962 --> 01:18:35.512
The request for civilian boats,
Bertie, was not a request.

01:18:35.591 --> 01:18:37.631
It was an order!

01:18:52.566 --> 01:18:54.606
- Miss Layton.
- Sir.

01:18:54.693 --> 01:18:57.493
I need to reach,

01:18:57.946 --> 01:18:59.106
to reach,

01:19:00.282 --> 01:19:01.702
to speak to...

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:04.200
To?

01:19:04.912 --> 01:19:06.042
3:00 p.m.

01:19:06.121 --> 01:19:07.371
2:00 p.m., sir?

01:19:08.415 --> 01:19:10.035
Yes. Yes.

01:19:10.125 --> 01:19:12.995
Ask Bridges to summon the...

01:19:14.087 --> 01:19:15.167
Oh, God.

01:19:15.255 --> 01:19:17.585
The War Cabinet, at 3:00 p.m.

01:19:17.674 --> 01:19:18.804
Thank you!

01:19:22.971 --> 01:19:24.141
Sir.

01:19:24.723 --> 01:19:27.433
From Lord Gort in France, sir.

01:19:32.356 --> 01:19:34.566
Belgium has fallen.

01:19:36.527 --> 01:19:39.697
They will surrender at midnight.

01:19:42.616 --> 01:19:44.616
France will soon follow suit.

01:19:57.631 --> 01:19:58.971
We have received reports

01:19:59.049 --> 01:20:00.759
that the most probable method of attack

01:20:00.843 --> 01:20:03.053
which Germany might employ
against this country

01:20:03.178 --> 01:20:05.928
is a large fleet of fast motorboats,

01:20:06.014 --> 01:20:08.774
possibly up to 200,
carrying a hundred men apiece,

01:20:08.851 --> 01:20:11.601
to carry out a seaborne raid
on a large scale.

01:20:11.687 --> 01:20:14.267
By these means,
a considerable force of the enemy

01:20:14.356 --> 01:20:16.396
could be landed
at many points on the coast

01:20:16.483 --> 01:20:19.613
simultaneously with airborne raids inland.

01:20:19.695 --> 01:20:23.455
We do not feel
that by naval or air action,

01:20:23.532 --> 01:20:25.532
we could prevent such a landing.

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:29.540
Could you repeat that?

01:20:29.955 --> 01:20:31.295
We must prepare

01:20:31.373 --> 01:20:33.503
for the imminent invasion of our island.

01:20:37.588 --> 01:20:40.088
We must prepare for
the imminent invasion of our island.

01:20:40.841 --> 01:20:42.551
We recommend that the country

01:20:42.634 --> 01:20:45.604
should be warned and roused
to the immediate danger,

01:20:45.679 --> 01:20:47.139
and that all personnel

01:20:47.222 --> 01:20:49.892
required to put Britain
in a state of defense

01:20:49.975 --> 01:20:53.275
should be mobilized
without a moment's delay.

01:20:53.353 --> 01:20:54.523
Lights.

01:21:00.611 --> 01:21:03.321
Thank you, General.

01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:10.200
Let all preparations be made.

01:21:11.705 --> 01:21:13.615
Let the record state, I have received word

01:21:13.707 --> 01:21:15.377
from the Italian embassy in London.

01:21:15.459 --> 01:21:17.629
Italy is prepared to mediate a resolution

01:21:17.711 --> 01:21:19.841
between Britain, its allies and Germany.

01:21:25.928 --> 01:21:28.468
Perhaps then,

01:21:30.307 --> 01:21:35.057
the time for such an offer from us

01:21:35.145 --> 01:21:36.765
is when...

01:21:41.318 --> 01:21:43.358
Well, is when...

01:21:45.739 --> 01:21:51.119
Is when Germany has made
an unsuccessful attempt

01:21:51.203 --> 01:21:53.793
- to invade this country.
- Unsuccessful?

01:21:53.872 --> 01:21:55.792
Then you leave me
no other option but to offer...

01:21:55.874 --> 01:21:57.634
Winston. Winston!

01:21:58.293 --> 01:22:02.463
You are refusing to grasp the realities

01:22:02.548 --> 01:22:05.968
of how precarious our position is.

01:22:06.677 --> 01:22:10.507
Our entire army is about to be wiped out.

01:22:10.889 --> 01:22:13.729
Terms must be struck.

01:22:18.730 --> 01:22:20.070
Anthony.

01:22:38.458 --> 01:22:41.038
Then it seems we...

01:22:43.005 --> 01:22:45.055
We have no choice

01:22:46.008 --> 01:22:48.638
but to at least consider the

01:22:49.386 --> 01:22:52.506
path of negotiation.

01:22:54.516 --> 01:22:57.556
If Hitler's peace terms are

01:22:59.688 --> 01:23:03.438
over lordship of Central Europe,

01:23:04.276 --> 01:23:08.276
return of certain German colonies,

01:23:09.323 --> 01:23:13.373
and if he will leave us

01:23:14.578 --> 01:23:16.868
our independence,

01:23:19.166 --> 01:23:22.336
then I'd be grateful

01:23:23.337 --> 01:23:26.007
to get out of our present...

01:23:27.508 --> 01:23:28.878
difficulties.

01:23:30.511 --> 01:23:32.301
But it is unlikely

01:23:33.263 --> 01:23:36.103
that he will make such an offer.

01:23:36.183 --> 01:23:41.353
But if I were told
what the German terms were,

01:23:46.068 --> 01:23:50.238
well, then I'd be prepared
to consider them.

01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:54.200
Thank you, Prime Minister.

01:23:55.035 --> 01:23:57.575
We shall prepare
a draft memorandum at once.

01:24:10.133 --> 01:24:14.053
I have come to wonder,

01:24:14.137 --> 01:24:16.967
in recent days...

01:24:21.728 --> 01:24:24.188
whether it was...

01:24:27.025 --> 01:24:28.895
part of my duty...

01:24:32.406 --> 01:24:35.156
part of my...

01:24:36.034 --> 01:24:38.504
part of my duty to...

01:24:40.163 --> 01:24:42.293
to consider...

01:24:44.251 --> 01:24:45.841
to consider,

01:24:52.217 --> 01:24:54.387
to consider...

01:24:56.972 --> 01:24:59.472
...whether it was...

01:24:59.558 --> 01:25:01.848
Will that be all for tonight, sir?

01:25:06.231 --> 01:25:09.281
...whether it was part of my duty

01:25:09.359 --> 01:25:13.449
entering into...

01:25:14.364 --> 01:25:17.534
into negotiations with,

01:25:22.331 --> 01:25:23.711
...that...

01:25:25.959 --> 01:25:27.839
...that corporal...

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:35.680
that child.

01:25:40.098 --> 01:25:43.018
And monster of wickedness.

01:25:44.770 --> 01:25:45.940
That butcher.

01:25:46.146 --> 01:25:49.516
That savage.

01:25:49.858 --> 01:25:52.148
Monstrous savage.

01:25:58.909 --> 01:26:00.739
That wicked

01:26:01.870 --> 01:26:04.080
house painter.

01:26:07.292 --> 01:26:09.212
House painter!

01:26:16.176 --> 01:26:19.296
Where were we?

01:26:22.766 --> 01:26:23.976
Well?

01:26:26.854 --> 01:26:28.774
I didn't understand you, sir.

01:26:30.315 --> 01:26:31.725
You were...

01:26:32.109 --> 01:26:33.359
Were?

01:26:34.444 --> 01:26:35.744
You were mumbling.

01:26:35.821 --> 01:26:37.571
"Mumbling."

01:26:42.828 --> 01:26:45.748
The right words

01:26:47.291 --> 01:26:48.751
won't come.

01:26:49.376 --> 01:26:50.616
They will come, sir.

01:26:51.253 --> 01:26:53.843
No one can put words together like you.

01:27:04.725 --> 01:27:05.735
Oh!

01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:18.320
Your beau?

01:27:19.698 --> 01:27:21.028
My brother.

01:27:23.744 --> 01:27:25.204
Where is he now?

01:27:25.871 --> 01:27:27.831
He was falling back on Dunkirk.

01:27:29.458 --> 01:27:31.128
But he never made it.

01:27:55.776 --> 01:27:56.936
What?

01:28:02.533 --> 01:28:04.453
Just looking at you.

01:28:31.395 --> 01:28:33.155
Shall I read back what we have?

01:28:35.691 --> 01:28:37.861
Yes, please.

01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:46.790
"I have come to wonder in recent days

01:28:47.703 --> 01:28:50.083
"whether it was my duty to consider

01:28:50.163 --> 01:28:54.633
"entering into negotiations with..."

01:28:58.338 --> 01:28:59.758
With?

01:29:47.930 --> 01:29:49.970
I've just been standing,

01:29:50.265 --> 01:29:54.225
imagining never being here anymore,

01:29:55.312 --> 01:29:57.732
whether it is because I'm no longer alive

01:29:57.814 --> 01:30:00.154
or that the palace itself is gone.

01:30:00.234 --> 01:30:02.034
Canada.

01:30:03.237 --> 01:30:04.647
You must decide, sir.

01:30:05.322 --> 01:30:06.492
You could rule in exile.

01:30:06.573 --> 01:30:09.083
Truly? Is that to be my fate?

01:30:14.122 --> 01:30:15.502
You know something?

01:30:15.582 --> 01:30:18.962
I'm aware in this moment of feeling angry.

01:30:21.630 --> 01:30:23.260
Bloody angry.

01:30:26.927 --> 01:30:28.637
Darling.

01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:33.390
Winston, darling.

01:30:36.186 --> 01:30:37.766
There's someone to see you.

01:30:38.438 --> 01:30:39.768
You have a visitor.

01:30:51.118 --> 01:30:53.408
My darling, you have the full weight

01:30:53.495 --> 01:30:55.115
of the world on your shoulders.

01:30:55.789 --> 01:30:57.619
No, I know, I know.

01:30:57.708 --> 01:31:00.168
But these inner battles

01:31:01.712 --> 01:31:04.212
have actually trained you

01:31:04.756 --> 01:31:06.166
for this very moment.

01:31:07.050 --> 01:31:09.720
You are strong because you are imperfect.

01:31:09.803 --> 01:31:13.853
You are wise because you have doubts.

01:31:16.101 --> 01:31:18.521
Now, shall I let him in?

01:31:20.272 --> 01:31:21.482
Who?

01:31:22.524 --> 01:31:23.694
The king.

01:31:23.775 --> 01:31:25.815
Which king?

01:31:26.528 --> 01:31:28.358
Our king?

01:31:28.447 --> 01:31:31.657
Well, if it isn't him,
it's a marvelous impersonation.

01:31:41.376 --> 01:31:42.836
Mr. Churchill.

01:31:43.128 --> 01:31:46.628
I hope you can forgive the late hour, but

01:31:46.715 --> 01:31:50.175
your wife thought tonight
would be a good time.

01:31:51.637 --> 01:31:52.847
Shall we sit?

01:31:53.263 --> 01:31:54.643
Oh, yes.

01:31:54.723 --> 01:31:56.523
Please.

01:32:00.729 --> 01:32:02.399
Something to drink, perhaps?

01:32:02.481 --> 01:32:03.611
No.

01:32:10.781 --> 01:32:16.161
I received a visit.

01:32:17.204 --> 01:32:18.464
From?

01:32:18.539 --> 01:32:20.039
Viscount Halifax.

01:32:20.123 --> 01:32:23.003
It appears that
the prospect of a peace deal

01:32:24.378 --> 01:32:27.838
has increased dramatically.

01:32:29.508 --> 01:32:33.928
The War Cabinet is drafting
a letter to Mussolini,

01:32:34.638 --> 01:32:39.808
asking him to broker talks
with Herr Hitler.

01:32:43.063 --> 01:32:46.153
Then Halifax was correct.

01:32:48.402 --> 01:32:50.702
I should like to know your mind.

01:32:50.779 --> 01:32:53.779
It would be helpful to know yours first.

01:32:54.116 --> 01:32:57.536
I should like to know it myself.

01:32:59.371 --> 01:33:01.501
Nations

01:33:01.957 --> 01:33:05.127
which go down fighting rise again,
and those

01:33:06.086 --> 01:33:08.376
that surrender tamely are finished.

01:33:08.463 --> 01:33:09.713
Belgium?

01:33:10.674 --> 01:33:12.094
- Collapsed.
- Norway?

01:33:12.176 --> 01:33:13.506
Holland.

01:33:14.094 --> 01:33:15.724
France any hour.

01:33:15.804 --> 01:33:17.224
And the mood of Parliament?

01:33:17.306 --> 01:33:18.386
Fear. Panic.

01:33:18.473 --> 01:33:20.023
And you?

01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:23.480
Are you not afraid?

01:33:24.855 --> 01:33:27.905
I am, most terribly.

01:33:29.568 --> 01:33:34.318
Support in the War Cabinet

01:33:35.490 --> 01:33:37.700
for the campaign of resistance

01:33:39.077 --> 01:33:40.287
has collapsed.

01:33:48.462 --> 01:33:53.972
Later today,
I will address the House accordingly.

01:34:04.770 --> 01:34:06.600
You have my support.

01:34:13.904 --> 01:34:15.494
Your Majesty?

01:34:16.532 --> 01:34:18.662
You have my support.

01:34:21.078 --> 01:34:22.618
I confess, I

01:34:23.497 --> 01:34:27.417
had some reservations about you
at first, but

01:34:27.501 --> 01:34:31.051
while some in this country
dreaded your appointment,

01:34:31.129 --> 01:34:35.259
none, none dreaded it like Adolf Hitler.

01:34:35.342 --> 01:34:39.142
Whomever can strike fear
into that brute heart

01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:42.220
is worthy of all of our trust.

01:34:42.724 --> 01:34:44.024
We shall work together.

01:34:44.101 --> 01:34:46.981
You shall have my support at any hour.

01:34:47.646 --> 01:34:49.266
Beat the buggers.

01:34:50.691 --> 01:34:52.361
I will go to Parliament.

01:34:53.277 --> 01:34:56.447
But without support in my own party,

01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:58.910
I must sue for peace.

01:35:02.953 --> 01:35:04.413
You once gave me some advice.

01:35:04.496 --> 01:35:06.916
Perhaps I can... I can give you some.

01:35:08.167 --> 01:35:09.877
Go to the people.

01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:12.340
Let them instruct you.

01:35:12.421 --> 01:35:15.471
Quite silently, they usually do.

01:35:15.883 --> 01:35:17.263
But tell them

01:35:18.302 --> 01:35:20.972
the truth unvarnished.

01:35:21.054 --> 01:35:23.474
If invasion is imminent,

01:35:23.557 --> 01:35:25.677
if our troops in France are lost,

01:35:26.101 --> 01:35:27.691
they must be prepared.

01:35:31.148 --> 01:35:32.938
On certain matters,

01:35:34.902 --> 01:35:39.282
I have very few people with whom I can

01:35:39.698 --> 01:35:42.408
talk frankly.

01:35:42.492 --> 01:35:44.242
Perhaps now we have each other.

01:35:46.371 --> 01:35:48.791
And I no longer scare you?

01:35:48.874 --> 01:35:50.544
A little.

01:35:50.959 --> 01:35:52.459
But I can cope.

01:36:02.846 --> 01:36:04.676
We are ready. More or less.

01:36:04.765 --> 01:36:07.185
More or less what, Bertie?

01:36:07.267 --> 01:36:08.807
Give me a number.

01:36:08.894 --> 01:36:11.564
In total, 860 vessels.

01:36:11.647 --> 01:36:14.397
The biggest civilian fleet ever assembled.

01:36:14.483 --> 01:36:17.033
Operation Dynamo waits on your command.

01:36:17.110 --> 01:36:18.780
Admiral,

01:36:19.363 --> 01:36:22.243
initiate Dynamo.

01:36:22.324 --> 01:36:25.044
And may God watch over them all.

01:37:50.162 --> 01:37:51.872
We've lost the prime minister.

01:38:14.186 --> 01:38:16.266
Do you know how to use this thing?

01:38:16.355 --> 01:38:17.445
Yes, sir.

01:38:18.690 --> 01:38:20.780
How do I get to Westminster?

01:38:20.859 --> 01:38:22.529
Westminster.

01:38:23.779 --> 01:38:26.199
The District Line, east. One stop.

01:38:26.281 --> 01:38:28.991
District Line. East. One stop.

01:38:29.076 --> 01:38:31.486
Well, that doesn't sound so hard.

01:38:31.578 --> 01:38:32.658
No, sir.

01:38:32.746 --> 01:38:34.206
Thank you.

01:38:34.289 --> 01:38:35.789
Thank you, sir.

01:38:35.874 --> 01:38:40.304
The memorandum is titled
"Suggested Approaches to Italy"

01:38:40.379 --> 01:38:41.759
and is as follows.

01:38:41.839 --> 01:38:45.259
"If Signor Mussolini
will cooperate with us

01:38:45.342 --> 01:38:49.182
"in securing a settlement
of all European questions

01:38:49.263 --> 01:38:51.063
"which safeguard
the independence

01:38:51.139 --> 01:38:55.349
"and security of the allies,
and could be the basis

01:38:55.435 --> 01:38:58.305
"of a just and durable peace for Europe,

01:38:58.397 --> 01:39:01.517
"we will undertake at once to discuss,

01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:04.150
"with the desire to find solutions,

01:39:04.236 --> 01:39:06.736
"the matters in which Signor Mussolini

01:39:06.822 --> 01:39:08.912
"is primarily interested.

01:39:08.991 --> 01:39:12.331
"We understand that
he desires the solution

01:39:12.411 --> 01:39:14.831
"of certain Mediterranean questions,

01:39:14.913 --> 01:39:18.793
"and if he will state
in secrecy what these are,

01:39:18.876 --> 01:39:21.836
"France and Great Britain will at once

01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:24.210
"do their best to meet his wishes."

01:39:29.636 --> 01:39:33.596
So, this is the Underground.

01:39:46.361 --> 01:39:47.611
Thank you.

01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:28.030
Does anyone have a match?

01:40:33.659 --> 01:40:35.039
Thank you.

01:40:36.495 --> 01:40:38.125
Thank you.

01:40:40.666 --> 01:40:42.826
What are you all staring at?

01:40:42.918 --> 01:40:45.378
Have you never seen the prime minister

01:40:45.462 --> 01:40:47.302
ride the Underground before?

01:40:50.342 --> 01:40:51.762
What is your name?

01:40:51.844 --> 01:40:53.764
Oliver Wilson, sir.

01:40:55.138 --> 01:40:56.848
And what do you do, Mr. Wilson?

01:40:56.932 --> 01:41:00.142
- Bricklayer, sir.
- Ah, bricklayer.

01:41:00.227 --> 01:41:03.557
We shall have great need
of bricklayers soon.

01:41:03.647 --> 01:41:05.187
Business will be looking up.

01:41:09.820 --> 01:41:11.490
Progress.

01:41:17.119 --> 01:41:18.289
How old?

01:41:18.370 --> 01:41:19.540
Five months, sir.

01:41:19.621 --> 01:41:21.751
He looks like you.

01:41:22.374 --> 01:41:24.924
Madam, all babies look like me.

01:41:27.629 --> 01:41:28.959
Well, what is your name?

01:41:29.047 --> 01:41:30.717
Mrs. Jessie Sutton.

01:41:30.799 --> 01:41:32.629
Ah, Mrs. Sutton.

01:41:32.718 --> 01:41:34.138
It's a pleasure.

01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:36.300
Abigail.

01:41:36.638 --> 01:41:37.848
Abigail Walker.

01:41:37.931 --> 01:41:40.931
- Marcus Peters.
- Marcus Peters.

01:41:43.687 --> 01:41:45.857
- Agnes Dillon.
- Agnes.

01:41:45.939 --> 01:41:48.529
- Maurice Baker.
- Mr. Baker.

01:41:48.609 --> 01:41:50.899
- Alice Simpson.
- Alice Simpson.

01:41:50.986 --> 01:41:52.776
Miss Margaret Jerome.

01:41:53.155 --> 01:41:54.785
Oh, a Jerome.

01:41:54.865 --> 01:41:56.835
My mother was a Jerome.

01:41:56.909 --> 01:42:00.079
I expect we are closely related.

01:42:01.121 --> 01:42:02.911
Please, please. Sit.

01:42:02.998 --> 01:42:04.208
Sit, everyone.

01:42:07.836 --> 01:42:09.916
Thank you, Mr. Baker.

01:42:10.005 --> 01:42:14.755
So, how are you all,
how are you all bearing up?

01:42:15.844 --> 01:42:17.724
Good spirits?

01:42:17.804 --> 01:42:19.184
- Yes.
- Yes?

01:42:19.264 --> 01:42:20.934
Just as well.

01:42:21.016 --> 01:42:22.846
We shall need them.

01:42:24.978 --> 01:42:26.768
Let me ask you something

01:42:27.231 --> 01:42:30.821
that's been weighing on my mind.

01:42:30.901 --> 01:42:33.821
Perhaps you can provide me with an answer.

01:42:34.363 --> 01:42:38.453
You, the British people.

01:42:39.409 --> 01:42:41.329
What is your mood?

01:42:41.912 --> 01:42:44.872
Is it confident?

01:42:44.957 --> 01:42:47.167
- Yeah.
- If confident, how confident?

01:42:47.251 --> 01:42:50.171
- Very.
- Some people say it's a lost cause.

01:42:50.254 --> 01:42:51.924
No, lost causes are the only ones

01:42:52.005 --> 01:42:54.005
- worth fighting for.
- Too right.

01:42:54.091 --> 01:42:56.011
Yes. Now let me ask you this.

01:42:56.093 --> 01:42:58.053
If the worst came to pass

01:42:58.136 --> 01:43:02.176
and the enemy were to appear on those...

01:43:02.266 --> 01:43:05.266
those streets above, what would you do?

01:43:05.352 --> 01:43:07.192
- Fight.
- Fight the fascists.

01:43:07.271 --> 01:43:08.915
Fight them with anything
we can lay our hands on.

01:43:08.939 --> 01:43:11.439
- Broom handles if we must.
- Street by street.

01:43:11.525 --> 01:43:13.235
They will never take Piccadilly.

01:43:13.986 --> 01:43:16.526
Never take Piccadilly, indeed.

01:43:16.613 --> 01:43:19.703
And what if I put it to you all

01:43:19.783 --> 01:43:25.503
that we might, if we, if we ask nicely

01:43:25.581 --> 01:43:29.671
get very favorable terms from Mr. Hitler

01:43:29.751 --> 01:43:33.671
if we enter into a peace deal
with him right now?

01:43:34.131 --> 01:43:35.721
What would you say to that?

01:43:35.799 --> 01:43:38.339
Never! Never! Never!

01:43:38.427 --> 01:43:40.097
Never! Never!

01:43:48.312 --> 01:43:49.562
Never.

01:43:51.690 --> 01:43:52.980
Never.

01:43:54.234 --> 01:43:56.034
Will you never give up?

01:43:56.111 --> 01:43:57.651
No. Never.

01:43:59.281 --> 01:44:03.951
"Then out spake brave Horatius,

01:44:06.246 --> 01:44:08.826
"Captain of the Gate:

01:44:10.042 --> 01:44:13.172
"To every man upon this earth

01:44:13.253 --> 01:44:17.923
"Death cometh soon or late.

01:44:18.717 --> 01:44:23.347
"And how can man die better

01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:25.850
"Than facing fearful odds

01:44:28.352 --> 01:44:30.982
- "For the ashes..."
- "For the ashes of his fathers

01:44:31.438 --> 01:44:34.188
"And the temples of his Gods."

01:44:44.117 --> 01:44:45.537
Are you crying?

01:44:45.994 --> 01:44:47.294
I...

01:44:47.621 --> 01:44:50.371
Yes, yes. I...

01:44:50.707 --> 01:44:52.827
I blub a lot, you know.

01:44:54.461 --> 01:44:56.801
You'll have to get used to it.

01:44:59.174 --> 01:45:01.134
What stop is this?

01:45:01.552 --> 01:45:03.642
It's Westminster, sir.

01:45:04.054 --> 01:45:07.434
Westminster. It's my stop.

01:45:39.298 --> 01:45:40.668
Prime Minister.

01:45:43.510 --> 01:45:44.590
Sir.

01:45:46.388 --> 01:45:48.058
The War Cabinet.

01:45:48.140 --> 01:45:49.560
Sir, they're waiting.

01:45:49.641 --> 01:45:52.231
I'm due to address the Outer Cabinet.

01:45:53.103 --> 01:45:54.523
- When?
- Now.

01:45:54.605 --> 01:45:56.405
I haven't spoken to them

01:45:56.481 --> 01:45:58.401
since the formation of the new government.

01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:03.700
- Prime Minister.
- Good day, gentlemen.

01:46:03.780 --> 01:46:05.870
Prime Minister...

01:46:05.949 --> 01:46:10.249
I-I'm about to, speak to
my Outer Cabinet in my rooms,

01:46:10.329 --> 01:46:13.539
and I extend the invitation to any of you

01:46:13.624 --> 01:46:15.084
who would care to join them.

01:46:17.169 --> 01:46:19.669
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

01:46:37.940 --> 01:46:39.440
This afternoon,

01:46:41.944 --> 01:46:44.034
I shall address the House

01:46:45.364 --> 01:46:48.494
on the matter of our nation's security.

01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:53.330
At this very moment, the War Cabinet

01:46:53.413 --> 01:46:57.423
is drafting papers
that lay out a willingness

01:46:57.501 --> 01:47:00.921
to enter into peace talks
with Herr Hitler,

01:47:01.630 --> 01:47:03.300
via his

01:47:04.132 --> 01:47:06.592
his lackey, Mussolini.

01:47:08.637 --> 01:47:13.557
I have thought
very carefully in these last days

01:47:13.642 --> 01:47:16.272
whether it was part of my duty

01:47:16.979 --> 01:47:21.189
to consider entering
into negotiations with...

01:47:25.362 --> 01:47:27.032
With that man.

01:47:29.366 --> 01:47:31.446
But then I...

01:47:33.704 --> 01:47:37.044
I spoke with

01:47:40.460 --> 01:47:42.130
Oliver Wilson,

01:47:43.130 --> 01:47:45.720
Mrs. Jessie Sutton,

01:47:46.425 --> 01:47:49.895
Mrs. Abigail Walker,

01:47:50.262 --> 01:47:52.512
Marcus Peters,

01:47:52.598 --> 01:47:54.768
Maurice Baker,

01:47:54.850 --> 01:47:56.350
Alice Simpson

01:47:56.435 --> 01:47:59.195
and Miss Margaret Jerome.

01:47:59.563 --> 01:48:01.823
Brave, good, true citizens
of this kingdom.

01:48:01.899 --> 01:48:05.989
And they argued strongly
that it was idle to think,

01:48:06.069 --> 01:48:08.949
if we tried to make peace now,

01:48:09.031 --> 01:48:12.741
we should get better terms
than if we fought it out.

01:48:13.785 --> 01:48:18.495
The Germans, Mr. Baker felt,

01:48:18.832 --> 01:48:22.292
would demand,
in the name of disarmament,

01:48:22.377 --> 01:48:24.457
our naval bases and much else,

01:48:24.546 --> 01:48:26.336
and I think he's right.

01:48:26.423 --> 01:48:30.433
Jessie Sutton, speaking for many,

01:48:30.511 --> 01:48:34.011
believes we would then become a...

01:48:34.097 --> 01:48:36.057
a slave state.

01:48:36.600 --> 01:48:40.480
A British government
which would be Hitler's puppet.

01:48:40.562 --> 01:48:44.822
A government set up under Mosley

01:48:44.900 --> 01:48:47.030
- or some such person.
- No, no.

01:48:47.110 --> 01:48:50.820
And I join with them in asking
a further question.

01:48:50.906 --> 01:48:53.406
A question I now put to you.

01:48:54.117 --> 01:48:58.157
Where should we be
at the end of all that?

01:49:03.418 --> 01:49:05.248
Some might benefit.

01:49:05.462 --> 01:49:09.632
I mean, the powerful might
be able to parlay good terms,

01:49:09.716 --> 01:49:12.636
preserved in their country redoubts,

01:49:12.719 --> 01:49:17.099
out of sight of the swastika flying over

01:49:17.182 --> 01:49:19.732
over Buckingham Palace!

01:49:19.810 --> 01:49:21.850
Over Windsor!

01:49:22.187 --> 01:49:24.687
And, draped on these very buildings!

01:49:24.773 --> 01:49:26.573
- Never! Never!
- No! No!

01:49:26.650 --> 01:49:28.650
So I come to you...

01:49:30.362 --> 01:49:33.032
I come to you

01:49:34.074 --> 01:49:38.044
to learn your minds in this grave hour.

01:49:39.121 --> 01:49:42.041
You see, it was pointed out to me

01:49:42.124 --> 01:49:46.254
by my new friends
that you might even rise up

01:49:46.336 --> 01:49:49.336
and tear me down were I for one moment

01:49:49.423 --> 01:49:51.423
to contemplate parlay or surrender.

01:49:56.430 --> 01:49:57.680
Were they wrong?

01:49:57.764 --> 01:49:59.064
No!

01:49:59.141 --> 01:50:00.481
- Were they wrong?
- No!

01:50:00.559 --> 01:50:02.229
Were they wrong?

01:50:02.311 --> 01:50:04.191
- No!
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:50:04.271 --> 01:50:05.731
Then I have heard you.

01:50:06.190 --> 01:50:07.900
I have heard you.

01:50:10.194 --> 01:50:14.074
It appears to be your will also

01:50:14.615 --> 01:50:19.545
that if this long island story
of ours is to end at last,

01:50:19.620 --> 01:50:23.460
then let it end only when each one of us

01:50:23.707 --> 01:50:28.207
lies choking in his own blood
upon the ground!

01:50:28.295 --> 01:50:31.265
- Yes!
- Bravo!

01:50:31.340 --> 01:50:32.630
Yes.

01:50:35.135 --> 01:50:37.545
And when I asked
to know their minds,

01:50:37.638 --> 01:50:39.508
there occurred a demonstration which,

01:50:39.598 --> 01:50:41.808
considering the character
of the gathering,

01:50:41.892 --> 01:50:43.692
quite surprised me.

01:50:44.353 --> 01:50:48.823
There is no doubt that if we falter at all

01:50:48.899 --> 01:50:50.729
in the leading of the nation,

01:50:50.817 --> 01:50:53.607
we should all be hurled out of office.

01:50:54.279 --> 01:50:55.819
I am sure now that every minister

01:50:55.906 --> 01:50:57.276
on both sides of the House

01:50:57.366 --> 01:50:59.866
is ready to be killed quite soon,

01:50:59.952 --> 01:51:03.042
and have all his family
and possessions destroyed,

01:51:03.121 --> 01:51:04.711
rather than give in.

01:51:05.624 --> 01:51:09.344
In this, they represent
almost all the people.

01:51:10.045 --> 01:51:14.795
And it falls to me
in these coming days and months

01:51:15.259 --> 01:51:18.929
to express their sentiments.

01:51:21.390 --> 01:51:25.940
There shall be no negotiated peace.

01:51:30.315 --> 01:51:32.685
And you must each do now

01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:34.990
as you see fit.

01:51:39.825 --> 01:51:43.125
If you will excuse me, gentlemen

01:51:43.203 --> 01:51:46.753
I believe I am due to address Parliament.

01:51:47.249 --> 01:51:51.169
And I have yet to write
a word of my speech.

01:51:51.253 --> 01:51:52.923
There's the buggers.

01:51:56.258 --> 01:51:57.878
- Tiny.
- Sir.

01:52:03.807 --> 01:52:05.847
- Miss Layton.
- Sir.

01:52:06.351 --> 01:52:07.771
I am in need of you.

01:52:10.189 --> 01:52:13.019
We must both now resign,
force a vote of no confidence.

01:52:14.401 --> 01:52:16.991
Well, let us go to the Commons first,

01:52:17.696 --> 01:52:18.776
join our colleagues.

01:52:20.157 --> 01:52:23.737
Then speak after
the prime minister's address.

01:52:43.096 --> 01:52:45.426
Here is a woman who's always tired,

01:52:46.391 --> 01:52:50.191
for she lives a life
where too much is required.

01:53:18.131 --> 01:53:20.381
The Prime Minister.

01:53:29.685 --> 01:53:33.815
Turning once again
to the question of invasion,

01:53:33.897 --> 01:53:37.977
I would observe that there
has never been a period

01:53:38.068 --> 01:53:41.568
in all these long centuries
of which we boast

01:53:41.655 --> 01:53:47.295
when an absolute guarantee
against invasion

01:53:47.744 --> 01:53:50.664
could have been given to our people.

01:53:51.540 --> 01:53:53.290
Hear, hear.

01:53:57.588 --> 01:53:59.458
But I have myself

01:54:00.382 --> 01:54:04.302
full confidence that if all do their duty,

01:54:04.845 --> 01:54:07.395
if nothing is neglected,

01:54:07.848 --> 01:54:09.428
and the best arrangements are made,

01:54:09.516 --> 01:54:12.056
as they are being made,

01:54:12.561 --> 01:54:15.441
we shall prove ourselves once more able

01:54:15.522 --> 01:54:18.022
to defend our island home.

01:54:18.108 --> 01:54:22.488
To ride out the storm of war

01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:26.410
and to outlive the menace of tyranny.

01:54:26.491 --> 01:54:28.331
If necessary

01:54:28.744 --> 01:54:32.584
for years, if necessary

01:54:33.707 --> 01:54:34.917
alone.

01:54:36.919 --> 01:54:39.549
At any rate, that is what we are

01:54:39.630 --> 01:54:41.460
are going to try to do.

01:54:42.007 --> 01:54:46.757
That is the resolve
of His Majesty's Government,

01:54:46.845 --> 01:54:48.605
- every man of them.
- To your right, please.

01:54:49.056 --> 01:54:51.266
That is the will

01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:53.730
of Parliament and the nation.

01:54:53.810 --> 01:54:56.060
Hear, hear.

01:54:56.939 --> 01:54:58.769
The British Empire

01:54:58.857 --> 01:55:00.527
and the French Republic,

01:55:00.609 --> 01:55:04.779
linked together
in their cause and in their need,

01:55:05.072 --> 01:55:07.622
will defend to the death

01:55:07.699 --> 01:55:09.619
their native soil.

01:55:09.701 --> 01:55:11.041
Hear, hear!

01:55:11.119 --> 01:55:14.909
Aiding each other like good comrades

01:55:15.374 --> 01:55:17.924
to the utmost of their strength.

01:55:18.001 --> 01:55:19.091
Hear, hear.

01:55:21.296 --> 01:55:25.426
Even though large tracts of Europe

01:55:25.717 --> 01:55:27.757
and many old and famous states

01:55:27.845 --> 01:55:32.145
have fallen or may fall into

01:55:32.224 --> 01:55:35.814
the grip of the Gestapo

01:55:36.061 --> 01:55:40.271
and all the odious apparatus
of the Nazi rule,

01:55:41.066 --> 01:55:43.896
we shall not flag or fail.

01:55:45.195 --> 01:55:47.905
We shall go on to the end!

01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:49.990
Hear, hear!

01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:56.080
We shall fight in France.

01:55:56.790 --> 01:56:00.880
We shall fight
on the seas and the oceans.

01:56:01.378 --> 01:56:05.088
We shall fight with growing confidence

01:56:05.174 --> 01:56:07.134
and growing strengths in the air.

01:56:07.217 --> 01:56:08.547
Hear, hear!

01:56:08.635 --> 01:56:11.965
We shall defend our island,

01:56:12.055 --> 01:56:14.675
whatever the cost may be.

01:56:14.766 --> 01:56:16.886
Hear, hear.

01:56:17.186 --> 01:56:20.146
We shall fight on the beaches.

01:56:20.230 --> 01:56:23.940
We shall fight on the landing grounds.

01:56:24.401 --> 01:56:27.491
We shall fight in the fields

01:56:27.571 --> 01:56:29.821
and in the streets.

01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:33.080
We shall fight in the hills.

01:56:33.493 --> 01:56:35.663
We shall never surrender!

01:56:38.207 --> 01:56:41.037
- Hear, hear.
- Hear, hear.

01:56:45.339 --> 01:56:46.799
And if...

01:56:50.969 --> 01:56:52.599
And if

01:56:54.097 --> 01:56:57.227
which I do not for a moment believe,

01:56:57.476 --> 01:57:02.016
this island or large part of it were...

01:57:02.105 --> 01:57:05.225
were subjugated and starving,

01:57:05.943 --> 01:57:10.323
then our empire beyond the seas,

01:57:10.405 --> 01:57:14.445
armed and guarded by the British fleet,

01:57:14.952 --> 01:57:18.792
- would carry on the struggle.
- Hear, hear!

01:57:19.373 --> 01:57:21.623
Until, in God's good time,

01:57:22.125 --> 01:57:26.955
the New World,
with all its power and might,

01:57:27.464 --> 01:57:30.184
steps forth to the rescue

01:57:30.259 --> 01:57:33.009
and the liberation of the old!

01:58:10.215 --> 01:58:11.835
Bravo!

01:58:11.925 --> 01:58:13.335
Victory!

01:58:14.553 --> 01:58:18.723
Victory! Victory!

01:58:23.312 --> 01:58:24.902
Changed your mind?

01:58:25.647 --> 01:58:27.517
Those who never change their mind

01:58:27.983 --> 01:58:29.733
never change anything.

01:58:32.988 --> 01:58:34.358
What just happened?

01:58:35.449 --> 01:58:37.739
He mobilized the English language

01:58:39.036 --> 01:58:40.946
and sent it into battle.
