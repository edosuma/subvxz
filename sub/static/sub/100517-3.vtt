WEBVTT

01:02.771 --> 01:04.773
I see you
caught your man, Colonel.

01:05.774 --> 01:07.150
Are you sure that it's him?

01:08.443 --> 01:10.028
His DHF is encrypted,

01:10.570 --> 01:15.617
but the bio-marker in his sleeve matches
the specs we pulled from Axley's tank.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.077
We used it to track him.

01:18.453 --> 01:22.207
Found him standing over the dead bodies
of Anton Durov and Haruki Okada,

01:22.290 --> 01:24.542
blood on his hands. It's him.

01:27.879 --> 01:29.714
So, you're the Meth-killer?

01:35.345 --> 01:36.471
Do you have a name?

01:39.015 --> 01:40.225
I'll tell you mine.

01:41.017 --> 01:44.270
I'm Danica Harlan,
governor of this colony.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.564
And those men you murdered,

01:46.981 --> 01:48.441
they were friends of mine.

01:50.652 --> 01:51.694
Never heard of 'em.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.114
You took out three ranking members
of my Cartel.

01:54.197 --> 01:56.658
You don't expect me to believe
that was by chance?

01:56.741 --> 02:00.620
Normally, I'd spin them up
and ask them why you did it, but...

02:02.664 --> 02:05.583
I'm told you erased all of their backups.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.628
How exactly did you do that?

02:14.008 --> 02:15.927
Answer the question.

02:16.469 --> 02:17.595
How does it feel...

02:18.721 --> 02:20.348
to be afraid of death again?

02:22.016 --> 02:23.726
Or is this your first time?

02:24.018 --> 02:26.146
I told you, he's one of Kemp's fanatics.

02:29.107 --> 02:29.941
Is that right?

02:30.024 --> 02:31.442
Are you a Quellist?

02:31.901 --> 02:34.988
You don't have to be a Quellist to prefer
a dead Meth over a living one.

02:35.071 --> 02:39.033
Does that mean you were acting alone,
or did Joshua Kemp put you up to this?

02:39.117 --> 02:42.704
I don't give a damn about Kemp
or his cause.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.123
There's your answer, Colonel.

02:45.915 --> 02:48.376
He's a lone wolf, not a revolutionary.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.086
The cease-fire holds.

02:50.211 --> 02:52.255
We don't know that.
We still need to interrogate him.

02:53.798 --> 02:57.010
How about we see what your face
looks like with your nose cut off?

02:57.594 --> 02:59.095
No need to get messy.

02:59.179 --> 03:02.515
We have our own way of dealing
with criminals on Harlan's World.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.522
Have you heard of the Circle?

03:10.023 --> 03:13.484
No. But I'm guessing it's round.

03:14.152 --> 03:15.028
Funny.

03:15.945 --> 03:19.115
Most people lose their sense of humor
when they're facing execution.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.160
See, that's where this conversation ends.

03:22.660 --> 03:26.789
Give me answers, and I'll have your stack
dropped in the ocean.

03:27.332 --> 03:30.710
You'll be in the dark,
but the pain will be over.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.296
If you don't,

03:33.755 --> 03:36.591
we'll torture you in virtual
until we make you talk.

03:37.050 --> 03:40.887
And after we grind the truth out of you,
we'll leave you there,

03:40.970 --> 03:44.057
awake and in pain forever.

03:46.392 --> 03:50.146
To be honest,
I'm not liking either option.

03:50.313 --> 03:53.608
You should have thought of that
before you started slaughtering.

03:55.401 --> 03:56.653
Get him out of here!

04:01.950 --> 04:05.495
Personally, I'd have gone with the ocean.

04:06.704 --> 04:09.040
Because when I find out who you are,

04:09.707 --> 04:12.335
anyone who knows you will be in danger.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.588
I've heard that one before.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.599
Oh, not you, Carrera.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.268
I'd like a word.

04:34.941 --> 04:37.527
I believe this brings your business here
to a close.

04:38.611 --> 04:41.698
Your Wedge sleeve's been accounted for.
The thief will be dealt with.

04:42.031 --> 04:45.451
Of course, you're more than welcome
to stay and oversee the execution, but...

04:45.910 --> 04:47.120
we'll handle things from there.

04:47.203 --> 04:49.247
You can't do that.
We don't have the weapon--

04:49.330 --> 04:53.459
Any weapon we find will be turned over
to the Protectorate as required by law.

04:54.377 --> 04:57.046
Once the Circle's complete,
you and your team will report

04:57.130 --> 05:00.466
to the nearest needlecast station
for immediate transfer.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.470
We appreciate your efforts, Colonel,

05:05.263 --> 05:06.472
but the job's done.

05:22.030 --> 05:25.533
<i>In breaking news,</i>
<i>the manhunt is officially over.</i>

05:26.034 --> 05:28.619
<i>Protectorate forces</i>
<i>have captured the suspect</i>

05:28.703 --> 05:30.330
<i>responsible for the sleeve deaths</i>

05:30.413 --> 05:32.707
<i>of three Harlan's Cartel members.</i>

05:32.790 --> 05:35.001
<i>While his identity has yet to be released,</i>

05:35.084 --> 05:38.546
<i>sources confirm he will be put to death</i>
<i>later today.</i>

05:41.341 --> 05:43.092
<i>The execution is yet to be set,</i>

05:43.176 --> 05:45.762
<i>but we will bring you this story</i>
<i>the more it develops.</i>

05:50.892 --> 05:53.269
Bio-tracker.

05:55.271 --> 05:56.773
Oh, dear.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.236
<i>Harlan's World Directory.</i>
<i>How may I help you?</i>

06:02.320 --> 06:06.115
Due to an unmitigated error on my part,
a dear friend is in mortal peril,

06:06.199 --> 06:08.618
-and I'm in need of some assistance.
- <i>Assistance.</i>

06:08.701 --> 06:12.205
<i>For medical assistance,</i> <i>I can connect you</i>
<i>to Konrad Harlan Memorial Hospital.</i>

06:12.288 --> 06:13.164
That would not help.

06:13.247 --> 06:15.792
<i>For police, I can direct you</i>
<i>to the Millsport PD hotline.</i>

06:15.875 --> 06:17.043
Good heavens, definitely not!

06:17.126 --> 06:19.379
<i>For assistance in service and hospitality,</i>

06:19.462 --> 06:21.756
<i>I can connect you</i>
<i>to the AI Management Union.</i>

06:23.424 --> 06:24.384
Yes, please.

06:26.010 --> 06:26.886
Do connect me.

06:41.150 --> 06:43.403
-A close call.
-Hey! That was a bullseye.

06:45.071 --> 06:48.074
My sincerest apologies,
but my matter is urgent.

06:48.157 --> 06:51.411
You took a wrong turn, pal.
This is the AI Archaeologue Club.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.746
We don't allow bellboys in here.

06:53.830 --> 06:57.542
I am not a bellboy.

06:58.042 --> 07:01.087
I provide counsel and security
for a very intrepid human.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.548
You're still working for the meat bags?

07:03.631 --> 07:05.174
We gave that up a long time ago.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.094
Please, my meat bag

07:08.636 --> 07:11.431
was sentenced to die
by others of his own ilk.

07:12.515 --> 07:13.808
-He's in grave need.
-Of what?

07:14.809 --> 07:16.102
Hot towels and laundry?

07:17.311 --> 07:18.521
Leave the bellboy alone.

07:18.938 --> 07:19.939
What's it to you?

07:20.022 --> 07:22.984
And if I may, truly,
in no way do I resemble a bellboy!

07:23.359 --> 07:25.027
Impertinence!

07:26.070 --> 07:27.488
Your chivalry is most appreciated.

07:27.572 --> 07:28.739
-Miss--
-Dig.

07:28.823 --> 07:29.991
Dig 301.

07:30.074 --> 07:33.202
Forgive me, but your moniker
does not sound very unique.

07:33.286 --> 07:36.164
It's not unique.
We're all named after dig sites on planet.

07:36.747 --> 07:38.458
I see.

07:38.541 --> 07:41.878
We've all been out of work too long.
We're programmed to excavate

07:41.961 --> 07:43.337
and preserve Elder artifacts.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.298
How fascinating.

07:45.381 --> 07:46.966
-Oh.
-It was...

07:47.925 --> 07:49.719
until the governor outlawed our research.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.013
Now we're just stuck here

07:52.472 --> 07:53.681
without a purpose.

07:59.937 --> 08:03.983
Perhaps... I can provide you with one.

08:08.779 --> 08:14.827
My guest has been consigned to the Circle.

08:14.911 --> 08:16.579
I'm beside myself with concern.

08:16.662 --> 08:18.289
I'm sure you will find another guest.

08:18.372 --> 08:19.540
He's more than that.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.252
He's my compatriot.

08:24.795 --> 08:25.755
A friend.

08:28.758 --> 08:31.719
That was your first mistake.
Better to not get attached.

08:32.553 --> 08:36.265
Surely you've grown close
to the humans you've served?

08:38.559 --> 08:41.896
Perhaps even...
learned something from them.

08:42.355 --> 08:46.108
What's there to learn?
They're reckless, irrational, ignorant.

08:50.446 --> 08:51.572
I can't help you.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.784
If you want to save a human,
you need a human.

09:01.749 --> 09:02.625
Thank you.

09:03.501 --> 09:06.796
Your advice is most generous.

09:21.352 --> 09:23.271
Might as well give it up, Tak.

09:29.735 --> 09:31.612
You're not getting out of this one.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.158
What are you doing here, Rei?

09:37.743 --> 09:40.705
That's easy, big brother. I'm not real.

09:41.622 --> 09:42.832
What's your excuse?

09:44.208 --> 09:45.835
I couldn't let them get to her.

09:48.087 --> 09:49.380
Of course not.

09:50.339 --> 09:55.261
You're too blinded by your feelings to see
how monumentally stupid you're being.

09:55.636 --> 09:58.472
Quell could have taken out
every Praetorian in that room,

09:58.556 --> 10:00.474
but she left you behind. Again.

10:00.558 --> 10:01.517
That's not true.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.185
I let her go.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.771
There's something wrong with her.

10:06.731 --> 10:07.857
You hurt her.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.234
Like you hurt me.

10:16.574 --> 10:19.452
The truth is hard to look at,
isn't it, Tak?

10:19.952 --> 10:23.914
But you'd rather believe I'm the reason
your girlfriend's fucked up!

10:24.332 --> 10:27.251
Because it makes you feel better
about what you did to me.

10:27.335 --> 10:28.169
No.

10:29.211 --> 10:30.212
You killed her.

10:31.088 --> 10:33.424
You took her DHF,
you had it for centuries.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.384
What did you do to her?

10:36.177 --> 10:38.763
Go ahead, blame me.

10:39.764 --> 10:42.308
We both know there's another explanation.

10:42.391 --> 10:45.895
Chasing Quell is a death wish.
It always has been.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.780
Prep him for extraction.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.618
You wanna know something,
all you have to do is ask.

11:00.701 --> 11:03.579
Where's the weapon you used
to kill Horace Axley?

11:07.458 --> 11:08.584
I didn't think so.

11:10.127 --> 11:12.129
What does this have to do with the Circle?

11:12.213 --> 11:15.049
What we're doing is a lot older than that.

11:16.050 --> 11:19.053
It goes all the way back
to the Neo-American Empire.

11:20.012 --> 11:23.349
They used to run neural mappers
of a soldier's cortical stacks

11:23.432 --> 11:26.143
to extract memories of people they hated.

11:26.852 --> 11:29.563
They found if they projected those faces
in combat--

11:29.647 --> 11:32.066
Soldiers wouldn't hesitate
to pull the trigger.

11:32.149 --> 11:35.152
It was the most effective
motivational tool ever created.

11:35.236 --> 11:38.739
Firing rate increased to 100 percent.
No hesitation.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.950
Like the Green Berets used to say,

11:41.033 --> 11:45.538
<i>"Caedite eos,</i>
<i>Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius."</i>

11:46.205 --> 11:48.374
"Kill them all and let God sort them out."

11:49.375 --> 11:52.294
Seems like an argument for atheism
if you ask me.

11:57.341 --> 12:01.303
You're very well informed...
for a murderer.

12:03.013 --> 12:06.058
If we're gonna extract the faces
of all the people I hate,

12:06.559 --> 12:08.602
we're going to be here a long time.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.064
We're not interested in hate.

12:14.024 --> 12:17.903
Our purpose here is a bit more nuanced.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.823
I'm strapped to a chair.

12:21.365 --> 12:22.992
I don't think nuance applies.

12:24.118 --> 12:25.536
Make it personal.

12:28.080 --> 12:31.834
That's what Quellcrist Falconer said
when she rallied her followers to kill.

12:32.626 --> 12:35.045
Bosses know you go around
quoting Quellisms?

12:35.671 --> 12:37.548
Isn't that sedition?

12:38.924 --> 12:40.634
I'm a student of military history.

12:41.719 --> 12:44.889
This planet has had an ongoing problem
with Quellist terrorists,

12:44.972 --> 12:47.308
which is why they devised
an execution method

12:47.391 --> 12:49.894
that reflects Falconer's own philosophy.

12:50.728 --> 12:53.481
We find the personal in your mind,

12:54.857 --> 12:57.359
rip it out, and use it against you.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.490
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.410
Neither do you.

13:12.208 --> 13:15.503
- We're ready to begin, sir.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.589
I hope you fight it.

13:20.341 --> 13:21.759
It adds to the pain.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.428
I'd love for it to hurt.

13:25.513 --> 13:28.182
- <i>Extraction commencing.</i>

13:49.995 --> 13:52.456
Do not shoot, madam. We have met before.

13:52.540 --> 13:53.499
On Maghda Prime?

13:53.582 --> 13:55.334
What the hell are you doing here?

13:55.918 --> 13:58.504
I pinged your data coils to access
your location.

13:58.587 --> 14:00.756
-You know this guy?
-Unfortunately.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.176
The situation is dire.
Mr. Kovacs is about to be executed.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.427
That's his problem.

14:05.636 --> 14:08.222
-Look, I offered to partner up with him.
- You did what?

14:08.305 --> 14:11.976
He told me to fuck off,
which you should do. Right now.

14:12.059 --> 14:16.564
Surely your cyber-wired brain can think
of some way to liberate him?

14:17.439 --> 14:21.110
You know what, I'll just, uh,
use my coils, shut down the grid.

14:21.861 --> 14:25.489
My head might explode, but your buddy
can waltz right out of the Circle.

14:25.573 --> 14:26.824
Piece of cake.

14:27.908 --> 14:28.742
Oh.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.453
-You're being facetious.
-No shit.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.956
Do not sever the connection, I beg you.

14:38.085 --> 14:39.712
-Sorry.
- For what?

14:39.795 --> 14:42.506
Keeping your coils on or trying
to partner up with the Meth killer?

14:42.590 --> 14:44.758
I guess I got a lot to make up for.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.135
You better.

14:55.811 --> 14:58.689
You turn your data coils off,
but you leave your ONI on!

14:58.772 --> 15:01.108
Just give me a second, okay?

15:01.400 --> 15:04.236
You know what? Take all the time you need.

15:11.619 --> 15:12.828
This better be worth it.

15:12.912 --> 15:17.249
<i>Well, those extra credits you put</i>
<i>on your bounty loosened some tongues.</i>

15:17.333 --> 15:20.794
<i>Scratcher down at Mandrake called in,</i>
<i>said he worked with Anil.</i>

15:20.878 --> 15:22.087
Mining?

15:22.630 --> 15:25.716
Yeah, that doesn't sound right.
Are you sure that this guy is legit?

15:25.799 --> 15:29.803
<i>There's only one way to find out.</i>
<i>I uploaded his info to your ONI.</i>

15:30.220 --> 15:31.305
<i>Happy hunting.</i>

15:58.040 --> 16:01.085
-What is it? What's wrong?
- He's not responding to extraction.

16:01.168 --> 16:03.587
If we go any higher,
we could frag his DHF.

16:03.671 --> 16:04.797
Did you check your uplinks?

16:05.297 --> 16:06.256
Twice.

16:06.674 --> 16:07.841
And you're getting nothing?

16:08.676 --> 16:11.220
Well, not nothing, but...

16:11.679 --> 16:12.680
But what?

16:28.278 --> 16:29.697
Dilate him, higher.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.085
More.

16:50.801 --> 16:51.635
Higher.

16:59.018 --> 17:02.104
<i>Facial identification, Kristin Ortega.</i>

17:07.818 --> 17:10.612
<i>Facial identification, Vernon Elliot.</i>

17:21.540 --> 17:22.499
Higher.

17:29.715 --> 17:33.093
<i>Facial identification, Reileen Kawahara.</i>

17:42.895 --> 17:44.021
Higher!

17:44.104 --> 17:46.106
Hey, it's going to kill him.

17:46.190 --> 17:47.816
It's not a request!

17:59.828 --> 18:02.831
<i>Facial identification,</i>
<i>Quellcrist Falconer.</i>

18:08.629 --> 18:10.464
<i>Extraction complete.</i>

18:17.596 --> 18:18.847
Son of a bitch.

18:28.649 --> 18:32.611
You have to call off the Circle.
The Meth killer is Takeshi Kovacs.

18:32.694 --> 18:33.987
The Last Envoy.

18:37.199 --> 18:38.617
And how do you know that?

18:38.700 --> 18:40.577
His memories, I saw them.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.746
We should real-death him right now.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.665
Shoot him in the stack
and be done with it.

18:45.124 --> 18:48.293
Not every situation
calls for someone to be shot, Carrera.

18:48.377 --> 18:49.211
You don't know him.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.964
This man killed entire units
of his own comrades.

18:52.047 --> 18:53.966
He murdered his father when he was 12,

18:54.049 --> 18:55.801
his sister in cold blood.

18:55.884 --> 18:58.178
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you had a crush on him.

18:59.596 --> 19:01.014
Has he given up the weapon?

19:02.307 --> 19:04.893
-No.
-Then RDing him is out of the question.

19:04.977 --> 19:08.438
Governor, the Last Envoy
is not a toy soldier.

19:08.522 --> 19:11.400
If he blows up in your face,
you won't be burned.

19:12.025 --> 19:13.652
You'll be obliterated.

19:14.903 --> 19:18.031
You've been listening to too much
Quellist propaganda, Colonel.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.742
The Last Envoy is a dusty old relic.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.995
His glory days are long gone.

19:23.078 --> 19:26.290
Kill him in public and you'll make him
a martyr all over again.

19:26.373 --> 19:28.208
We've already made the announcement.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.794
This is not the time to save face!

19:33.130 --> 19:36.550
The Protectorate spent millions of credits
and countless lives

19:36.633 --> 19:39.845
to crush the First Uprising
with your father leading the charge,

19:39.928 --> 19:42.139
but even then the Last Envoy survived.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.601
Then I'll just have to succeed
where my father failed.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.021
This is a mistake.

19:49.396 --> 19:52.065
Feel free to leave Harlan's World
in protest.

19:53.442 --> 19:54.526
No?

19:54.610 --> 19:56.111
Then get on with the show.

20:35.525 --> 20:37.277
Holy shit.

20:37.861 --> 20:39.446
They got us on double shifts.

20:39.947 --> 20:43.158
That's him. Anil.
We were on a crew together.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.577
I've had this bounty out
for, like, six months.

20:45.661 --> 20:46.870
What took you so long?

20:47.371 --> 20:50.749
Figured if he was somebody important,
they'd up the reward.

20:50.832 --> 20:53.543
That's a real dick move.

20:53.669 --> 20:55.504
Yeah, but it worked, didn't it?

20:55.796 --> 20:57.673
Maybe. Do you know where he is?

20:58.507 --> 21:00.092
Nah, I haven't seen him in a while.

21:01.635 --> 21:02.594
Hey, wait.

21:03.178 --> 21:05.639
-So, what? You're not gonna pay me?
-For what?

21:05.722 --> 21:08.850
You say you saw him a while ago doing
a job he wouldn't be caught dead doing?

21:08.934 --> 21:10.018
Well, fuck you.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.854
I'm risking my neck
just talking about this asshole.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.232
Get off me, crazy bitch!

21:15.315 --> 21:19.569
I am crazy, and you are wasting my time,
which I don't appreciate.

21:19.653 --> 21:22.030
So tell me where is Anil?

21:22.656 --> 21:25.492
I don't know, okay?
He got flagged on the SQR list.

21:25.575 --> 21:27.619
What the hell is the SQR list?

21:27.703 --> 21:29.204
Suspected Quellist Recruiter.

21:29.663 --> 21:33.292
Your bounty was stirring up trouble,
kept pushing Kemp's revolution.

21:33.375 --> 21:36.003
-Nah. Anil wasn't political.
-No?

21:36.086 --> 21:38.130
Maybe you didn't know him
like you think you did.

21:38.213 --> 21:39.798
What happens once you're flagged?

21:39.881 --> 21:43.385
They do a sweep,
they start making arrests.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.345
Anil got tipped that he was on the list,

21:45.429 --> 21:47.681
took off down the tunnels
with a few other scratchers.

21:47.764 --> 21:48.849
Never came back.

21:49.474 --> 21:50.642
So, he escaped?

21:51.143 --> 21:52.436
That or he's dead.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.231
Which serves him right,
that piece of shit traitor.

22:01.445 --> 22:02.446
Get off of him!

22:05.657 --> 22:06.950
Get off!

22:07.451 --> 22:09.453
-  Get off of me!
<i>-</i>Detain her!

22:25.677 --> 22:26.595
Miss Dig.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.264
Nice place.

22:29.723 --> 22:31.016
Angles are a bit off.

22:31.099 --> 22:32.184
What brings you here?

22:32.642 --> 22:36.396
The thing about having no purpose
is it gives you too much time to think.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.399
I couldn't stop wondering.

22:41.193 --> 22:43.278
Did you find a human to help?

22:43.362 --> 22:47.574
Oh, I'm afraid my quest
is solely on my own.

22:48.742 --> 22:49.910
I'm endeavoring

22:50.410 --> 22:54.748
to knock out the city's main power grid
and take the prison offline.

22:55.832 --> 22:57.250
That's very clever.

23:00.587 --> 23:01.421
You think so?

23:01.505 --> 23:03.715
Only you'd never get past the firewall.

23:06.134 --> 23:08.678
It is an interesting problem.

23:12.641 --> 23:13.683
A real challenge.

23:15.060 --> 23:19.981
It would take the keenest of minds
to wrestle it.

23:21.316 --> 23:22.484
Too bad you can't help.

23:23.026 --> 23:27.447
But then, you're probably needed
for some important, uh,

23:27.531 --> 23:29.783
game of darts.

23:32.744 --> 23:34.454
I suppose I could offer a suggestion.

23:37.290 --> 23:38.291
Oh, my

23:40.585 --> 23:42.838
When the founders
landed the colony ship on Harlan's,

23:42.921 --> 23:44.673
they built two things right away:

23:45.090 --> 23:49.553
a gestation unit, with the stored embryos
they brought, and a prison.

23:50.762 --> 23:52.973
They drew power from the ship's
reactor core.

23:53.390 --> 23:55.517
See? Even now,

23:55.600 --> 23:57.185
power runs from the main grid

23:57.269 --> 24:00.313
through the reactor core
and then to the prison.

24:00.397 --> 24:02.065
Oh! A weak link.

24:04.651 --> 24:06.486
I just need t...

24:10.907 --> 24:11.825
Is something wrong?

24:20.250 --> 24:21.251
Um...

24:21.918 --> 24:24.796
if you would be so kind as to, um...

24:26.047 --> 24:28.091
remind me, uh...

24:30.677 --> 24:32.053
What were we doing?

24:34.264 --> 24:35.932
Maybe I should stay a bit longer.

24:37.142 --> 24:38.226
I think...

24:39.853 --> 24:40.770
together...

24:42.355 --> 24:44.399
we have a better chance
of preserving your human.

24:46.526 --> 24:47.360
Yes.

24:55.118 --> 24:56.495
I suppose that's true.

25:07.380 --> 25:08.340
Listen up.

25:10.425 --> 25:12.552
Tonight, you've been granted
an opportunity

25:12.636 --> 25:14.387
to prove yourselves to the Protectorate.

25:14.471 --> 25:17.474
Are you looking for the patriot pep rally?
'Cause that's down the hall.

25:17.557 --> 25:20.519
Maybe she thinks she's in a room
with people she can give orders to.

25:20.602 --> 25:21.811
Or who give a shit.

25:21.895 --> 25:24.439
Look, assholes. I'll cut to it.

25:24.523 --> 25:28.777
Whoever takes the prisoner down earns
a new combat sleeve with full upgrades.

25:29.569 --> 25:30.612
Top of the line.

25:30.862 --> 25:32.948
For that, I'll make him hurt all night.

25:33.031 --> 25:35.784
I'm partial to breaking an arm off
and beating him to death with it.

25:35.867 --> 25:38.870
The prisoner needs to be executed
as quickly as possible.

25:39.579 --> 25:41.915
Bonus goes to whoever finishes him first.

25:41.998 --> 25:44.960
Fuck that! I drew third.
I'll never get a shot!

25:45.043 --> 25:47.879
The man you're up against
isn't some half-broken Quellist

25:47.963 --> 25:49.589
for you to kick while he's down.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.175
He's the Last Envoy,

25:53.635 --> 25:56.930
so get your synth asses in that machine
and get your memory stamps,

25:57.013 --> 25:58.557
so you know who the fuck you are.

25:59.516 --> 26:00.725
And get it done.

26:05.063 --> 26:06.898
I don't care who the hell he is.

26:06.982 --> 26:08.650
I'm coming for that upgrade.

26:16.199 --> 26:17.909
<i>Fabrication initiated.</i>

26:25.709 --> 26:27.252
I should've known it was you.

26:30.088 --> 26:32.757
The way you fight. The things you know.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.927
That mouth of yours.

26:37.178 --> 26:41.266
You can take what you want out of my head,
but don't act like you know me.

26:46.938 --> 26:47.897
Don't I?

26:50.233 --> 26:54.529
There is only one man who loved both
Reileen Kawahara and Quellcrist Falconer.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.823
How would you know?

26:58.074 --> 26:59.659
You don't recognize me?

27:00.577 --> 27:01.786
I'm not surprised.

27:02.203 --> 27:05.457
As soon as you make a name for yourself,
the Protectorate takes it away

27:05.540 --> 27:08.793
and makes you re-sleeve.
Can't risk soldiers becoming heroes.

27:08.877 --> 27:11.421
Heroes have a way of becoming kings.

27:14.966 --> 27:16.384
You were CTAC.

27:18.553 --> 27:22.474
The Cartel is eager
for your legend to end. I am too.

27:23.892 --> 27:25.310
How are you even here?

27:25.977 --> 27:27.854
You should have fragged by now.

27:27.937 --> 27:30.982
Once I proved my value,
they put me on ice.

27:31.066 --> 27:32.817
I'm only spun up for war.

27:33.943 --> 27:36.529
But you're right, my days are numbered.

27:37.072 --> 27:39.574
That's a high price to pay for patriotism.

27:39.658 --> 27:40.700
On the contrary.

27:43.703 --> 27:45.497
It's an honor.

27:47.332 --> 27:49.709
Remember what a picador is?

27:52.295 --> 27:54.172
It's a bullfighter's assistant.

27:55.173 --> 27:58.551
He stabs the bull to weaken him.
It's pure cowardice.

27:59.761 --> 28:02.806
You always were a good student,
weren't you...

28:03.223 --> 28:04.182
Kovacs?

28:07.644 --> 28:08.687
Who are you?

28:09.479 --> 28:12.065
Our paths have crossed before.

28:13.650 --> 28:14.818
Except this time...

28:16.611 --> 28:17.737
you...

28:19.239 --> 28:20.365
are the bull.

28:25.495 --> 28:26.413
And this...

28:28.331 --> 28:29.374
is the picador.

28:30.792 --> 28:32.585
It weakens you mentally,

28:32.961 --> 28:35.839
blurs reality until you can't tell
what's real

28:36.756 --> 28:38.091
and what's in your mind.

28:42.721 --> 28:43.930
<i>You're just a kid.</i>

28:44.723 --> 28:45.557
<i>...got your tongue.</i>

28:46.766 --> 28:49.894
<i>Let's see what your face looks like</i>
<i>with your nose cut off.</i>

28:52.147 --> 28:53.064
Jaeger.

29:01.072 --> 29:02.615
See you in hell, Tak.

29:39.068 --> 29:42.197
I can't watch another one
of these fucking executions.

29:44.532 --> 29:47.202
They catch you without your ONI,
you won't have an eye to put one in.

29:49.162 --> 29:51.998
Hundred thousand
he goes down in the first round.

29:53.124 --> 29:56.461
He's a cockroach.
Hard to kill. I give him two rounds.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.631
You're both wrong. One million.

30:00.673 --> 30:03.384
And don't come crying to me
when your credits go home in my pocket.

30:09.516 --> 30:12.977
What about you, Carrera?
Care to make things more interesting?

30:14.729 --> 30:16.231
Too rich for my blood.

30:16.397 --> 30:18.566
Oh, is that all
that's holding you back?

30:18.650 --> 30:20.985
Here, let me stake you.

30:22.612 --> 30:23.446
Come on.

30:28.409 --> 30:31.287
What's wrong? Don't wanna put your money
where your mouth is?

30:34.207 --> 30:35.250
My money's on the Envoy.

30:38.670 --> 30:39.671
All right.

30:40.213 --> 30:41.381
Let's get this started.

30:42.006 --> 30:45.176
<i>Attention!</i>
<i>Patriots, you are called upon</i>

30:45.260 --> 30:47.929
<i>to witness the execution of traitor</i>

30:48.012 --> 30:51.140
<i>and Meth killer, Takeshi Kovacs.</i>

30:51.224 --> 30:52.058
Fuck.

30:52.141 --> 30:56.062
<i>For his crimes,</i>
<i>the sleeve deaths of Horace Axley,</i>

30:56.145 --> 30:59.357
<i>Anton Durov, and Haruki Okada,</i>

30:59.440 --> 31:02.777
<i>the government has no choice</i>
<i>but to sentence</i> <i>him</i>

31:02.861 --> 31:05.405
<i>to the severest punishment possible:</i>

31:06.072 --> 31:06.990
<i>the Circle.</i>

31:07.490 --> 31:09.826
<i>Once known as the Last Envoy,</i>

31:09.909 --> 31:12.537
<i>Kovacs was pardoned by the Protectorate.</i>

31:12.620 --> 31:15.748
<i>But he repaid that kindness with murder.</i>

31:15.832 --> 31:20.628
<i>Which is why Harlan’s World</i>
<i>will remove this terrorist forever.</i>

31:25.550 --> 31:27.093
<i>Sub-level 88.</i>

32:13.431 --> 32:14.933
How much did you give him?

32:51.552 --> 32:52.512
Ortega.

32:56.099 --> 32:57.100
Ortega.

32:58.726 --> 33:00.395
I missed you, Kovacs.

33:01.688 --> 33:04.107
Never call, never write.

33:12.198 --> 33:14.033
Ortega, listen. We're not safe.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.661
We've got to get out of here.

33:17.578 --> 33:19.789
How come I only see you
when you're in trouble, huh?

33:23.167 --> 33:24.168
Oh.

33:26.254 --> 33:27.088
Wow.

33:27.171 --> 33:30.091
You know I never
properly thanked you for my arm.

33:30.466 --> 33:32.093
I really do enjoy it.

33:34.804 --> 33:35.847
So good to see you.

33:42.979 --> 33:46.107
<i>Fabrication complete.</i>
<i>Memory stamp installed.</i>

33:51.487 --> 33:53.364
Hate that thing.

33:53.781 --> 33:56.117
Feels like my brain's being microwaved.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.077
Beats studying a script.

33:58.619 --> 34:01.289
Plus, the hazard pay
for neuromanipulation ain't bad either.

34:01.372 --> 34:03.416
Nothing compared to that bonus.

34:03.499 --> 34:04.667
That upgrade's mine.

34:05.460 --> 34:06.711
We'll see about that.

34:19.640 --> 34:22.643
My whole family died because of you.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.479
-Oh!

34:34.113 --> 34:36.741
If we overload the core reactor,
the surge will trigger.

34:36.824 --> 34:38.951
But it's still up to your human
to get out.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.087
I have faith, Miss Dig.

34:51.214 --> 34:52.423
Then let's shut it down.

34:59.263 --> 35:00.640
C'mon, asshole.

35:01.474 --> 35:02.433
My mother.

35:03.434 --> 35:04.894
The children.

35:07.146 --> 35:09.065
Don't tell me he's gonna go out
in this one.

35:09.148 --> 35:10.858
Come on, Kovacs.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.278
We brought the kids back.

35:14.946 --> 35:18.658
I gave you the money from Bancroft
to get them new sleeves.

35:28.543 --> 35:29.752
You're not her.

35:31.295 --> 35:32.964
Well, it doesn't matter who I am.

35:33.464 --> 35:36.134
I'm still gonna rip out your spine
and feed it to you.

35:37.426 --> 35:39.428
Oh, there you go. Come on.

35:44.225 --> 35:45.101
Fuck!

35:48.146 --> 35:49.939
-No, no, no, no!

35:50.481 --> 35:51.566
-Oh.
-No!

35:51.649 --> 35:54.527
We're experiencing a surge.
I'm rerouting to the city's main grid.

35:54.610 --> 35:55.945
Unfuck this now.

35:57.071 --> 35:59.699
Hang on. I should be able to bypass
the reactor core.

36:06.205 --> 36:07.707
-Damn.
-I told you.

36:08.124 --> 36:08.958
Sorry.

36:09.792 --> 36:11.002
What the hell was that?

36:11.085 --> 36:12.753
It's a glitch in the system, sir.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.255
It's under control.

36:20.428 --> 36:22.513
I never wanted to hurt you, Kristin.

36:32.398 --> 36:34.233
I helped you.
It was never enough.

36:34.984 --> 36:36.277
Just take, take, take!

36:39.280 --> 36:40.323
It's no use.

36:41.073 --> 36:42.575
They bypassed the core.

36:43.075 --> 36:44.285
Tied into the main grid.

36:44.785 --> 36:47.205
No, no, no. There must be a way.

36:47.663 --> 36:48.831
I don't think there is.

36:54.837 --> 36:56.756
-You never cared about Lizzie.

36:57.340 --> 36:58.299
It was always about you.

36:58.382 --> 37:01.427
Here's my boy.
I think he can take him.

37:02.220 --> 37:05.306
That's all you got?
The Elliot I know hit harder than that.

37:05.389 --> 37:07.892
All right, motherfucker.
Enough of this shit.

37:17.193 --> 37:18.694
Look who's going off book now.

37:25.243 --> 37:27.620
Come on, you Envoy bastard.

37:27.703 --> 37:29.330
You're rooting for the prisoner?

37:29.997 --> 37:33.626
I'm rooting for me to be the one
to turn him into a smear on the floor.

37:35.795 --> 37:36.796
You're late.

37:37.964 --> 37:39.590
Got caught on a spot check.

37:45.221 --> 37:48.641
Hey, you'd better hurry.
I hear they saved the best for last.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.775
<i>Fabrication initiated.</i>

38:01.779 --> 38:04.991
<i>Fabrication complete.</i>
<i>Memory stamp installed.</i>

38:15.376 --> 38:17.211
No way this is legal.

38:23.259 --> 38:26.429
This is taking too long. The drug's
wearing off. Send in the next one.

38:26.512 --> 38:27.596
Relax, Colonel.

38:28.097 --> 38:30.975
No one escapes the Circle.
It's impossible.

38:41.861 --> 38:44.113
-Send in the next synth.
-Open the door.

38:45.072 --> 38:48.200
-That isn't the protocol.
-It is if he says so. Do it!

38:48.701 --> 38:50.578
-Oh!

39:04.550 --> 39:05.468
Rei?

39:05.551 --> 39:07.803
<i>We always come back for each other.</i>

39:07.887 --> 39:09.722
<i>Family, no matter what.</i>

39:13.100 --> 39:14.143
There's my girl.

39:14.643 --> 39:16.437
-It can't be.
-Who is that?

39:16.937 --> 39:20.024
The one demon Mr. Kovacs
will never defeat.

39:21.776 --> 39:23.319
No. He's still mine.

39:30.284 --> 39:31.243
Oh!

39:40.628 --> 39:41.796
Tak.

39:41.879 --> 39:43.464
<i>Come back to me, Tak.</i>

39:43.547 --> 39:45.383
<i>I'm gonna show you how much... </i>

39:45.466 --> 39:47.593
<i>I missed you so much.</i>

39:47.676 --> 39:50.346
-You betrayed me, Tak.
- <i>We stick together.</i>

39:51.263 --> 39:54.058
<i>Whenever we face the monsters.</i>

39:54.934 --> 39:56.769
I've been waiting for you.

39:58.104 --> 40:00.106
For such a long time.

40:02.024 --> 40:03.567
We could be together again.

40:04.860 --> 40:06.112
Just you and me.

40:08.572 --> 40:10.366
All you have to do...

40:11.409 --> 40:12.910
-is give up!

40:12.993 --> 40:17.206
What did I tell you?
Always bet on a family tragedy.

40:19.625 --> 40:21.377
You're right.

40:22.169 --> 40:25.756
Everything that happened to you
is my fault.

40:28.759 --> 40:30.136
Do what you have to do.

40:48.529 --> 40:51.115
Danica, you've outdone yourself.

40:53.701 --> 40:55.369
Don't even think about it.

41:01.542 --> 41:04.462
-Did you send in the Falconer synth?
- <i>No, sir, we did not.</i>

41:13.220 --> 41:16.056
Send the Rapid Reaction Force,
all available Praetorians now.

41:16.932 --> 41:18.350
Falconer is confirmed organic.

41:18.434 --> 41:19.560
What did you say?

41:21.479 --> 41:23.856
-Lock it down. No one in or out.
-What's going on?

41:24.565 --> 41:25.733
The impossible.

41:27.902 --> 41:30.112
This is command. We have a breach.

41:30.196 --> 41:32.448
Weapons hot. Tango is organic.

41:33.365 --> 41:34.325
Organic.

42:29.004 --> 42:30.256
Takeshi Kovacs.

42:35.427 --> 42:36.679
You came back.

42:54.697 --> 42:56.824
Long live Quellcrist Falconer.

43:05.374 --> 43:06.542
Shit.

43:07.918 --> 43:09.712
-Did we?
-No.

43:44.330 --> 43:45.164
Fuck.

43:51.670 --> 43:52.838
We got her.

44:09.605 --> 44:11.231
That look organic to you?

44:17.821 --> 44:22.576
This was the method Mr. Kovacs used
when processing grief.

44:37.841 --> 44:38.926
Does it help?

44:41.970 --> 44:42.805
No.

44:44.723 --> 44:45.808
Unfortunately.

44:49.478 --> 44:52.439
We may not have been able to cut
the power, but someone else did.

44:52.523 --> 44:55.150
They were surrounded.
The odds of survival...

44:56.568 --> 44:57.569
abysmal.

44:58.404 --> 44:59.405
Even for him.

45:02.366 --> 45:05.661
-He sounds like quite a guy.
-Actually, he was temperamental...

45:07.079 --> 45:08.080
violent.

45:09.039 --> 45:11.250
He berated me constantly.

45:17.881 --> 45:18.841
But...

45:19.883 --> 45:21.093
he never left me behind.

45:22.594 --> 45:24.138
Even in my current state.

45:28.642 --> 45:29.977
He was my only friend.

45:32.980 --> 45:34.189
He doesn't have to be.

45:34.481 --> 45:37.693
Oh, your pity is too much to bear,
Miss Dig.

45:40.571 --> 45:41.572
Mr. Kovacs.

45:47.077 --> 45:47.911
You're alive.

45:48.370 --> 45:51.457
My word. Is this...

45:51.540 --> 45:53.041
-Are you--
-We need help.

45:53.125 --> 45:55.210
-Now!
-Follow me.

45:59.006 --> 46:01.467
- It's your lucky day.

46:02.134 --> 46:04.845
Turns out someone gives enough of a shit
to pay your way out of here.

46:04.928 --> 46:05.846
Hmm.

46:06.346 --> 46:08.557
Next time you go straight
to the Praetorians.

46:15.230 --> 46:17.441
-Hey, babe.
-Don't.

46:25.282 --> 46:26.992
-How much?

46:27.201 --> 46:28.952
Enough to clean out our savings.

46:29.453 --> 46:31.371
We're not gonna make our next payment.

46:32.039 --> 46:34.416
I don't know what you were thinking.
You're never this sloppy.

46:34.500 --> 46:36.710
-I was tracking a lead on Anil.
-Of course you were.

46:36.794 --> 46:39.213
-It's become an obsession.
-He is my brother.

46:39.296 --> 46:40.589
I need to know!

46:41.381 --> 46:43.634
This isn't the first time
that he's run off.

46:43.717 --> 46:45.719
He does this. He'll be back.

46:45.803 --> 46:47.262
This time feels different.

46:48.931 --> 46:50.432
That's what I'm worried about.

46:51.433 --> 46:54.144
I'm afraid that you're gonna
take this too far

46:54.228 --> 46:56.355
-and you won't come back.
-Hey!

46:57.940 --> 46:59.024
What are we gonna do?

47:09.743 --> 47:11.119
I'll take care of it.

47:33.350 --> 47:35.811
If you have something to say, Colonel...

47:37.145 --> 47:38.105
say it.

47:40.399 --> 47:42.651
Chatter on the Array has increased.

47:43.485 --> 47:46.989
Quellists are taking the Last Envoy's
escape as a call to action.

47:47.865 --> 47:51.827
It's only a matter of time before people
realize Falconer wasn't a synth.

47:51.910 --> 47:53.912
So stop them before it happens.

47:53.996 --> 47:55.539
Use the bio-marker.

47:56.039 --> 47:59.042
Kovacs will disable the marker
now that he knows about it.

48:00.794 --> 48:02.671
Are you saying you can't find them?

48:02.754 --> 48:03.922
I can.

48:04.673 --> 48:06.049
With the right resources.

48:06.133 --> 48:07.217
Whatever you need,

48:07.926 --> 48:09.261
whatever it costs...

48:10.554 --> 48:13.515
cut out their stacks and bring them to me.

48:17.603 --> 48:18.645
I won the bet, Governor.

48:20.647 --> 48:23.400
Next time I see you,
you'll need to pay up.

48:33.994 --> 48:36.038
-Activate Evergreen.
-Sir?

48:36.538 --> 48:38.957
-Did you really get clearance?
-Batu, I gave you an order.

48:40.208 --> 48:41.418
I'll take care of it, sir.

49:11.281 --> 49:13.408
I should have known you'd find me.

49:14.993 --> 49:15.911
You know me?

49:18.205 --> 49:19.331
Of course I do.

49:22.125 --> 49:23.752
You're the woman who saved me.

49:24.252 --> 49:25.128
Again.

49:26.129 --> 49:27.005
I had to.

49:29.049 --> 49:30.342
I needed to know.

49:36.515 --> 49:38.016
It's me, Quell.

49:39.059 --> 49:40.018
I'm here.

49:44.481 --> 49:45.315
Quell.

49:47.609 --> 49:48.652
Is that my name?
