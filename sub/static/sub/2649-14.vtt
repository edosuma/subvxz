00:03.086 --> 00:04.963
Oh, I hope Tad likes salmon.

00:05.047 --> 00:06.845
It's a bit of a risk
serving fish ...

00:06.924 --> 00:08.471
to a first-time diner
at Dunphy's.

00:08.550 --> 00:10.552
Maybe I should marinate
a steak for backup.

00:10.636 --> 00:12.434
I think someone
has a man crush.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.515
First of all, I would never
date a potential client.

00:14.598 --> 00:16.145
That's first of all.

00:16.225 --> 00:18.944
Secondly, I really need this to go
well so he makes me his Realtor.

00:19.019 --> 00:22.068
This guy's flippin' properties like
they're extras in a kung fu movie.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.990
So you're just kissing up
to this guy for his money.

00:24.066 --> 00:25.534
Not just.
I really like him.

00:25.609 --> 00:29.409
He travels the world doing charity
work, rock climbs, flies planes.

00:29.488 --> 00:31.411
How does he have time
to do all that?

00:31.490 --> 00:33.367
Got divorced
and his whole life opened up.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.293
Guy's livin' the dream.

00:36.787 --> 00:39.415
His dream. Not my dream.

00:39.498 --> 00:40.966
I'm living my dream.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.801
You're my dream.
You can stop.

00:43.627 --> 00:45.379
I so don't want to do this.

00:45.462 --> 00:48.511
Recently, Haley got a little creative
on one of her college applications ...

00:48.590 --> 00:51.184
and listed herself
as a Big Sister.

00:51.260 --> 00:53.683
Technically,
I am a big sister.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.605
She capitalized
the "B" and the

00:55.681 --> 00:57.683
Which makes sense,
'cause it was.

00:57.808 --> 01:00.357
So Claire and I
suggested that- Forced.

01:00.435 --> 01:03.609
That she volunteer
for the organization.

01:03.689 --> 01:06.033
We couldn't be prouder.

01:06.108 --> 01:08.156
We could. A little bit.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.613
Hey, Dad, did you
accidentally leave ...

01:10.696 --> 01:13.245
this hilarious book of lawyer
jokes in the guest room?

01:13.323 --> 01:15.121
I'll tell you if you can
answer the following question:

01:15.200 --> 01:18.204
What's the difference between
a catfish and a lawyer?

01:18.287 --> 01:19.288
I don't know. What?

01:19.371 --> 01:21.248
Well, one's
a bottom-feeding mud dweller.

01:21.331 --> 01:22.833
The other's a fish.

01:22.916 --> 01:25.419
Zing! Aaah.

01:25.544 --> 01:28.423
Okay, everyone, dinner is served.
Let's get it.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.132
Our house is being fumigated,
so Jay and Gloria ...

01:30.215 --> 01:32.263
invited us to stay here
for a few days.

01:32.342 --> 01:35.095
I'm very excited to have 72 hours
with this one.

01:35.178 --> 01:36.805
We don't get to spend
much time together,

01:36.888 --> 01:40.893
so I know that we're
gonna be like, um- um-

01:41.018 --> 01:43.362
Fred and Ginger? Who?

01:45.105 --> 01:48.700
Movie night!

01:49.776 --> 01:52.245
It's noisier than usual
around here.

01:52.321 --> 01:54.369
Oh, gosh.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.125
# Hey, hey #

01:57.200 --> 01:59.248
# Hey, hey #

01:59.328 --> 02:01.251
# Hey, hey #

02:01.330 --> 02:03.173
# Hey, hey #

02:03.248 --> 02:04.716
# Hey ##

02:08.086 --> 02:09.679
Tad, this wine is fantastic.

02:09.755 --> 02:11.257
Spend a week in Mendoza,

02:11.340 --> 02:13.513
and you'll find a dozen
or so Malbec producers ...

02:13.634 --> 02:16.854
that'll give most Bordeaux a
real run for their money. Hmm.

02:16.928 --> 02:18.225
I'm sorry.

02:18.305 --> 02:21.354
"May cause pretentiousness."

02:21.433 --> 02:24.312
"May be fascinating."

02:24.394 --> 02:25.771
Oh!
Oh, gosh.

02:25.854 --> 02:28.573
Oh, that's like the ninth time
this screw has popped out.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.323
Oh, you know what? I need the angled screwdriver.
I left it at the office.

02:31.401 --> 02:35.201
I, um- I keep it there
because of all my signs.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.907
I'll, uh, put up
a "for sale" sign,

02:37.032 --> 02:40.036
and next day, of course, I gotta
put up that "sold" banner. Yeah.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.586
Then next day, same deal.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.171
For sale, sold. Mm-hmm.

02:43.246 --> 02:46.045
For sale, sold. For sale, sold.
Great, great salesman.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.588
I'm getting that.
For sale, sold.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.137
Right. Listen, I gotta
go relieve the babysitter.

02:50.212 --> 02:54.342
My ex-wife took 50% of my stuff
and left me 100% of my kids.

02:54.466 --> 02:56.059
They're great.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.929
Hey, listen, um, thank you
so much for coming. Yeah.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.686
Oh, no, thank you, Phil,
so much for the salmon ...

03:01.765 --> 03:04.518
and the steak and the
chicken and the shrimp.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.069
I mean, it was all just delicious.
Great.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.609
This guy is very lucky
to have you. Oh.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.741
Okay. Thanks.
Yeah.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.658
All right.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.205
Let me grab that.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.120
Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.

03:22.494 --> 03:24.792
- Did you see that?
- A handshake that almost became a hug?

03:24.871 --> 03:27.590
Yeah, I saw it. I lived it.
I think I'm in.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.259
No, honey.
He kissed me on the lips.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.879
Another good sign!
it's not a good sign.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.714
Sweetie, you don't think
that's weird?

03:33.797 --> 03:36.391
The guy's a world traveler. He
has a time-share in Costa Rica.

03:36.466 --> 03:37.809
That's probably
how they do it there.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.307
Oh, no, honey.
it felt like he lingered.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.481
It's a progressive culture.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.058
Most of 'em travel
by zip line.

03:44.141 --> 03:45.484
Mmm.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.236
Biscuits and gravy?

03:48.311 --> 03:51.611
Yep. My grandma Bitsy's secret
recipe, given to her ...

03:51.690 --> 03:54.864
by her housekeeper, Delilah, who
raised her and was her best friend.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.866
Kind of like The Help,
except Delilah was white,

03:56.945 --> 04:00.415
and was actually herself
quite the racist.

04:00.490 --> 04:01.537
Eat up.

04:01.616 --> 04:02.959
Good morning!

04:03.076 --> 04:03.998
Hi, Mom.
Hi, sweetheart.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.330
Ah. Where did those come from?

04:06.413 --> 04:09.166
- Yeah, I thought amaryllis were out of season.
- Oh, I got a guy.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.752
You know, I just thought they'd
brighten up the house a little bit.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.837
Oh, that was so thoughtful
of you.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.094
I didn't realize that my house
needed brightening up.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.517
There she is!

04:18.591 --> 04:20.265
Gloria, Gloria!
Â¡Ay!

04:20.343 --> 04:22.060
Let me fix your hair.

04:22.137 --> 04:25.186
Oh, well, isn't that sweet.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.439
I didn't realize
her hair was broken.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.737
Oh, that smells delicious,
but nothing for me.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.280
I've got
an early work lunch.

04:32.355 --> 04:35.575
Really? I didn't hear an ambulance.

04:35.650 --> 04:38.449
Yeah, it's funny because it's
what I've dedicated my life to.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.576
Oh, is this that meeting with
the deejay with the funny name?

04:40.655 --> 04:42.123
- Booker Bell.
- Booker Bell.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.951
- Booker Bell?
- Everybody now!

04:44.034 --> 04:45.786
Booker Bell was only
the greatest deejay ...

04:45.869 --> 04:47.496
in the history
of drive time radio.

04:47.579 --> 04:49.581
Yeah, well, now he has some
wetlands that developers want,

04:49.664 --> 04:51.632
and we're trying to get him
to donate for preservation.

04:51.708 --> 04:54.461
When I was on the road selling,
I used to listen to Booker all the time.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.262
He practically invented
the prank phone call.

04:56.379 --> 04:59.633
Okay. Wish me luck. Good luck, sweetie.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.686
Booker would play a prank, the sucker
would be twisting in the wind,

05:02.761 --> 05:04.354
and just when you couldn't
stand it anymore,

05:04.429 --> 05:06.773
he'd say, "Guess who just got
their Bell rung?"

05:06.890 --> 05:08.358
God, I'd love to meet him.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.481
Oh, they're just goin' down to Ray's.
You should pop down.

05:10.602 --> 05:12.696
I'm sure he'd love to meet a fan.
I don't know.

05:12.813 --> 05:16.113
I met Boz Scaggs once. Got all tongue-tied.
Oh, you'll be fine.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.614
Oh- Oh, Lily,
it's time for school, sweetie.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.363
Oh, I can take her.
Yay! Yay!

05:21.446 --> 05:23.790
Oh. That'd be great.

05:23.865 --> 05:26.118
Yeah, that'd give me some more
time to clean the kitchen.

05:26.201 --> 05:28.044
Maybe do a little dusting.

05:28.119 --> 05:30.747
- Delicious, Cam.
- Mm-hmm.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.419
Annie was amazing.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.800
So funny and cute and sweet.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.348
- Yeah, you've said.
- She made this for me last night.

05:40.423 --> 05:41.925
Look how she signs her name ...

05:42.008 --> 05:43.806
with that big loopy

05:43.885 --> 05:46.058
I'm totally going to frame this.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.105
I made this for Haley
four years ago.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.980
You think this got framed?

05:52.060 --> 05:54.609
She tossed it
in the garbage-

05:54.688 --> 05:58.409
right after she wrote "Mrs. Haley Jonas
Brothers" on it, like, 30 times.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.654
The tax write-off alone
makes financial sense,

06:01.736 --> 06:03.579
you know, even if you take
the environment out of it.

06:03.655 --> 06:05.157
Well, don't take
the environment out of it.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.163
Without the wetlands,
there's no ducks.

06:07.242 --> 06:09.210
Without the ducks, there's
nothing for me to shoot at.

06:09.286 --> 06:11.209
Okay, well, we're shootin'
from two different angles,

06:11.288 --> 06:13.962
but, uh, hopefully we'll
end up at the same place.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.417
Mitch.
Dad.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.549
I just had to stop down
and meet this guy.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.096
Booker Bell,
I'm Boz Scaggs-

06:20.171 --> 06:22.765
No, I mean- Jay
Pritchett, damn it!

06:22.841 --> 06:24.684
- It's nice to meet you.
- This is such an honor.

06:24.801 --> 06:28.556
- You are hands-down my favorite radio personality of all time.
- That's kind of you to say.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.106
Okay. Well, thanks
for stopping by, Dad.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.396
I gotta tell you one thing.
I'll see you back at the house.

06:32.475 --> 06:35.274
One time, when I was driving
from Youngstown to Sugar Creek,

06:35.353 --> 06:37.401
you called this guy
at a kitty litter company ...

06:37.480 --> 06:39.357
and you asked him to bring
over 900 pounds of litter.

06:39.441 --> 06:42.536
And in the background, you heard
all these lions roarin' and-

06:46.656 --> 06:49.409
L- I laughed so hard,
I almost had an accident.

06:49.492 --> 06:50.664
The car or you?

06:52.037 --> 06:54.540
Funny as ever.
Anyway-

06:54.623 --> 06:56.375
Hey, are you still in touch
with the old gang?

06:56.458 --> 06:58.176
Grandma Groovy?
Spaceman Clyde?

06:58.251 --> 07:00.629
- Are you kiddin'? I am the old gang.
- No way.

07:00.712 --> 07:03.215
I may be old,
but I still know how to boogie.

07:03.298 --> 07:04.891
My God, it's like she's here!

07:05.008 --> 07:06.601
She is here.

07:06.718 --> 07:08.470
How are you still not getting this?

07:08.595 --> 07:10.563
That's her.
Excuse me for a second.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.483
What are you doing?
What? I'm a fan.

07:14.601 --> 07:17.104
I came down to say hi.
This is a business meeting.

07:17.187 --> 07:19.610
Do you have any idea
how inappropriate this is?

07:19.689 --> 07:21.862
No. No, of course you don't, because
as far as you're concerned,

07:21.942 --> 07:25.242
all a lawyer does is walk into a
bar with a rabbi and a polar bear.

07:26.863 --> 07:30.242
Grizzly, 'cause otherwise, when the
bartender says- Dad, I'm working!

07:30.325 --> 07:32.544
You're embarrassing both of us.
Please, you gotta go.

07:32.661 --> 07:36.131
All right, I didn't realize that.
Yeah. Yeah, you didn't.

07:36.206 --> 07:37.674
I'm sorry. Go.

07:37.749 --> 07:40.343
Hey.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.680
Hey, where's my stalker? Oh, he's gone.
Got rid of him.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.928
Sorry that
he attacked you like that.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.556
Attacked? Nah. I don't mind a
little smoke up my bloomers.

07:48.635 --> 07:51.104
Well, I just thought since
this was a business meeting-

07:51.179 --> 07:54.558
And you thought maybe having somebody
make me feel good would wreck it?

07:54.641 --> 07:57.315
There's-There's been a lot of
tension between me and my dad.

07:57.394 --> 07:59.396
I'm actually staying
at his house, and it's just-

07:59.479 --> 08:01.698
Oh, so you chased away
a man who's opened his home to you.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.859
I get the sense
that I'm losing you.

08:04.943 --> 08:07.196
Could I talk
to Grandma Groovy?

08:07.278 --> 08:09.121
Honey, I'm home.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.165
Well, I didn't expect you
so early, dear.

08:11.241 --> 08:12.618
What? You?

08:12.701 --> 08:15.170
Yeah, look who came by
to fix the table.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.667
Well, I had some time
to kill,

08:16.788 --> 08:19.337
so I thought I'd drop by with
that tool your wife needed. Mmm.

08:19.416 --> 08:22.295
- Wow. What a guy.
- Mm-hmm. He also brought some wine.

08:22.377 --> 08:24.175
Well, you said you liked it
last night,

08:24.254 --> 08:26.097
so I had a couple
extra bottles lyin' around-

08:26.172 --> 08:29.346
Boy, do you know the way to this gal's heart

08:29.426 --> 08:32.179
I didn't just come here to fix your
table and get your wife drunk.

08:32.261 --> 08:35.482
I actually decided to give you that
listing on the Sycamore property.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.809
- Really? That's great.
- Yeah.

08:37.892 --> 08:39.690
Why don't you come over
for dinner tonight ...

08:39.769 --> 08:42.397
and, uh, we'll work out all
the details- One entrÃ©e.

08:42.522 --> 08:43.774
Okay.
Claire, you should come too.

08:43.898 --> 08:46.117
Oh, no, no. No, no. If it's
business, I'm- I insist.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.694
He insists. We'll be there.
We're coming.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.450
Shall we say, uh, 7:00?

08:49.571 --> 08:51.164
7:00 sounds great.
Okay.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.707
All right.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.284
I'll let myself out.
Okay.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.248
Wow.

08:59.330 --> 09:00.798
Wow is right.

09:00.915 --> 09:02.883
Mm-hmm.
I just got Sycamore,

09:02.959 --> 09:05.633
a house that sells itself
and gives me the commission.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.931
How does that not bother you?

09:08.006 --> 09:09.508
Claire, it's an expression.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.719
There's work.
Inspections, appraisals-

09:11.801 --> 09:15.146
He brought me wine. He took his
shirt off when you weren't here.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.895
Um, he brought us wine, and it doesn't
look super-vacuumed down there.

09:17.974 --> 09:19.442
I'm surprised
he kept his pants on.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.360
Okay. Okay. I can see
what's going on.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.063
You're just so focused
on getting his business ...

09:23.146 --> 09:25.069
that you don't see what's
going on in front of you.

09:25.190 --> 09:28.239
Okay. Now I do see what's going on.
What?

09:28.359 --> 09:30.032
Come here, pretty girl.
What?

09:30.111 --> 09:32.864
You are, you know.
You don't hear it enough.

09:32.947 --> 09:37.669
The other night, when you put on
makeup, I was like, "There she is."

09:37.744 --> 09:39.246
Oh, my God.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.798
You think I'm making this up
as some part of an ego boost?

09:41.873 --> 09:44.376
Do you realize
how insulting that is?

09:46.503 --> 09:48.050
What are you doing?

09:48.129 --> 09:49.597
Helping my little sister
with her homework.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.766
That seems ... mean.

09:51.841 --> 09:56.267
Annie, this is Alex- that other
sister I was telling you about.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.144
Hi. So nice to meet you.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.726
Um, if you're going
to study there,

10:00.809 --> 10:02.982
you might need to correct
numbers seven through 10.

10:03.061 --> 10:06.190
This bed has higher standards
than that bed.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.570
I'm going to get
some more lemonade.

10:10.860 --> 10:14.285
I think your sister's mad
at our sister.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.629
- We're back!
- Oh, well, there you are.

10:21.704 --> 10:24.127
I guess "lunch, then home" means
different things to different people.

10:24.207 --> 10:25.629
We had a girls' day.

10:25.708 --> 10:28.962
Lily, Lily, come. Show
your papa what we bought.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.797
Matching jackets!

10:30.880 --> 10:33.303
It's like she's the baby
leopard and I'm the mama.

10:33.383 --> 10:36.262
Or they just happened to have two
jackets, one large, one small.

10:37.428 --> 10:38.896
What happened here?
Where is my tea?

10:38.972 --> 10:40.645
Oh, it's in this drawer
over here.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.350
As a thank-you,
I took some time ...

10:42.433 --> 10:45.152
to rearrange your kitchen
so it makes sense.

10:45.228 --> 10:46.571
To who?

10:46.646 --> 10:48.523
To everyone. There's a flow now.
Watch.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.779
Tea, mug, kettle.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.868
You're welcome.
I didn't thank you.

10:54.571 --> 10:57.040
You don't have to.
I won't.

11:08.001 --> 11:12.256
Cam, our shared bathroom is not the place
to work out whatever's going on here.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.840
I'm a child of divorce.

11:13.923 --> 11:16.426
Conflict resolution
is something of a specialty.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.638
The key is, tell a personal story
that applies to their situation,

11:19.721 --> 11:21.439
even if you have to
make one up.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.767
That way, they really hear
what they need to hear.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.020
I'm sorry. You're right.

11:27.103 --> 11:30.107
No. I'm sorry I snapped.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.864
I'm just going through some stuff
with this girl I like, Danielle.

11:32.942 --> 11:36.367
She came over the other day,
and Stella was all over her,

11:36.446 --> 11:38.665
and I got jealous,
which is crazy, right?

11:38.740 --> 11:42.210
I mean, Stella was only playing
with her because she was new.

11:42.285 --> 11:46.006
Manny, sounds like Danielle was trying
to get between you and your puppy,

11:46.080 --> 11:47.332
and that ain't cool.

11:47.415 --> 11:51.136
She seems immature,
and you can do better.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.932
I'm sorry to be blunt, but I'm goin'
through somethin' myself right now.

11:55.006 --> 11:56.508
So chin up. Okay.

11:56.591 --> 12:00.141
It may not work every time, but
you only need one fish to bite.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.893
Who is this Danielle?

12:01.971 --> 12:05.066
She's my study partner in my history
class, and we share a notebook.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.735
But her notes are really
confusing, so I put them in order.

12:07.810 --> 12:10.063
Instead of thanking me
for making our lives easier,

12:10.146 --> 12:12.444
she got all mad because she
thought I was judging her.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.444
This girl
is very bad news, Manny.

12:16.527 --> 12:18.529
You stay away from her.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.126
Hey.
Hi.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.791
We're Phil and Claire.
Hey. I'm Tony.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.543
Come on in. I'll go get my dad.
Okay.

12:27.622 --> 12:28.874
Great. Thanks.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.251
Wow. I don't like the way
that kid was looking at you.

12:31.334 --> 12:34.588
We are not friends right now. I am only
here to help pump up the college fund.

12:34.671 --> 12:38.016
Claire, if Tad even makes a move
towards you, his ass is grass.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.310
Really?
I thought that was just my ego.

12:40.385 --> 12:43.104
So far, yeah, but just know
I'm ready to grass his ass.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.556
Hey, hey, hey, guys.
Oh, hey.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.308
Hey, how are you?
Good, good.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.934
Good to see you.
Yeah.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.519
Hi. That's good.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.650
Well, I love the place.
Did you remodel this?

12:51.729 --> 12:55.279
Uh, actually, my ex-wife. She had a,
uh, passion for modern architecture ...

12:55.358 --> 12:56.985
and at least one
modern architect.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.408
I have
to sell this one next.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.410
Really?
Wow. I love how open it is.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.158
Do you mind if I poke around?
Yeah.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.500
It's beautiful.
All right. Thanks.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.373
Tad, if you don't need my help
anymore with the kids,

13:06.494 --> 13:07.916
I'll be going.
Thank you so much, Ellen.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.755
You're welcome. Mmm. Okay,
we'll see you later.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.253
I saw this house
eight years ago.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.627
There used to be a wall here, right?
That's right. That's right.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.753
That was all covered.
Yeah. I'm a detail guy.

13:15.878 --> 13:18.051
Hard to get much past me.

13:18.172 --> 13:20.220
Hello, hello.
Hey, how are you?

13:20.300 --> 13:21.643
Good, Tad.
How you doing?

13:21.718 --> 13:22.719
Bye, Daddy.
Bye, sweetie.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.270
Bye, Dad.
Have fun.

13:24.387 --> 13:25.639
Okay. See you later.
All right, bye.

13:25.722 --> 13:26.974
Come on, guys. Let's go. Bye.

13:27.056 --> 13:30.185
These stairs used
to be teak, am I right?

13:30.268 --> 13:32.612
This guy's good.
Yeah. He's good.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.523
He's sharp.
I forgot my bag.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.650
You do that every time.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.407
Yeah.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.370
I don't miss much.

13:47.785 --> 13:49.458
Oh, I'm sorry.
Were you trying to read?

13:49.537 --> 13:51.130
You're the one
who tries to read.

13:51.205 --> 13:53.003
Oh, my gosh!
I am not that stupid!

13:53.082 --> 13:55.050
Seriously, Haley, you think you
are the coolest person ever.

13:55.126 --> 13:57.094
Stop just judging me
about everything that I do!

13:57.170 --> 13:58.843
Enough! Enough!

13:58.921 --> 14:01.219
I am so sick of you two
fighting all the time.

14:01.299 --> 14:04.553
You're a bad big sister,
and you're a bad little sister.

14:04.635 --> 14:07.889
And you're both
bad big sisters to me.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.474
Be normaler.

14:13.686 --> 14:17.611
Wow. I've never
seen him like that.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.569
Well, we do kind of neglect him.

14:20.651 --> 14:25.157
And if you think about it,
he is kind of our little sister.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.958
Remember how we used
to dress him up?

14:28.034 --> 14:29.661
I miss her.

14:29.744 --> 14:32.418
I hear you, and I don't
like where this is going.

14:32.497 --> 14:34.750
You get the lipstick. I'll get
the bra and tennis balls.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.926
Betty Luke!

14:37.001 --> 14:38.844
I will burn this house down!

15:00.358 --> 15:02.326
Where is the cheese grater?

15:06.155 --> 15:07.828
Where is the cutting board?

15:08.658 --> 15:10.160
Where would you want it to be?

15:13.704 --> 15:16.548
Yes, right here,
next to the cheese grater.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.718
I know it's hard to tell
by looking at me,

15:18.793 --> 15:21.421
but I am not
a natural homemaker.

15:21.504 --> 15:24.223
So when Cam came
and organized my kitchen,

15:24.298 --> 15:27.427
I felt insecure
and lashed out.

15:27.510 --> 15:31.060
In a way, I'm no better than
Manny's crazy friend Danielle.

15:32.515 --> 15:34.563
Can we just focus on the cooking?

15:39.021 --> 15:40.864
Daddy, we forgot
to give you this.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.694
It's like our jackets.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.615
I love it.

15:50.366 --> 15:53.961
I guess I've always been a little
sensitive about Lily not having a mother,

15:54.036 --> 15:55.663
and Gloria's so good at it.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.124
I got jealous.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.301
Maybe I should tell Manny
this story.

16:00.376 --> 16:03.004
It might help him with that
train wreck, Danielle.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.215
You know what? Why don't you
turn that music back on?

16:05.298 --> 16:07.096
It was kind of nice.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.706
Hey, Dad? Don't need
to talk about it.

16:33.784 --> 16:36.003
I was out of line comin' down there.
It won't happen again.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.422
- Scotch is at the bar.
- No, I've been giving this a lot of thought.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.502
- I guess we're gonna talk about it.
- I was rude to you.

16:41.584 --> 16:43.507
I think I was just annoyed
by all the lawyerjokes.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.054
I mean, let's be honest.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.757
You don't exactly beam with pride
over what I do for a living.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.934
Mockery is the sincerest form
of flattery.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.307
I'm pretty sure that's
not the saying, but-

16:52.386 --> 16:55.105
Um, you know, Manny told me a
story about his friend Danielle.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.980
Whew. She sounds like a real
piece of work, by the way.

16:58.059 --> 17:02.064
But, uh, it made me realize that I
take myself a little too seriously.

17:02.146 --> 17:04.523
Listen,
it goes without saying ...

17:04.607 --> 17:07.531
I've always been proud of you, and
I brag about you all the time.

17:07.609 --> 17:11.079
So if I say, "What do lawyers
use as birth control?",

17:11.155 --> 17:13.156
and the answer is,
"Their personalities,"

17:13.241 --> 17:14.992
I want you to know
I'm not referring to you.

17:16.368 --> 17:17.915
You don't need
any birth control.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.217
Hello.

17:23.291 --> 17:25.339
Yeah, this is Jay Pritchett.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.592
- What? When?
- What happened?

17:27.672 --> 17:29.049
It's the police.
My car got stolen.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.475
Yeah, 2012. Gray.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.646
No, not pewter.
More like a light- like a-

17:34.720 --> 17:36.939
No, not slate. Um-

17:37.014 --> 17:38.812
I don't even know
what Coastal Fog is.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.484
Just put down gray.

17:41.519 --> 17:43.192
Kilo? That's not my car.

17:43.271 --> 17:45.774
Yeah, she's Colombian.
What does that have to do with-

17:45.856 --> 17:47.403
No, I'm comin' down there.
Hang on.

17:47.483 --> 17:49.986
Grab your keys.
I think I might need a lawyer.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.032
Guess who
just got his Bell rung?

18:00.371 --> 18:03.591
That's good.
It's good.

18:03.666 --> 18:05.384
Here you go.
Have a seat.

18:05.459 --> 18:08.178
I got a bottle of port
from 1899.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.346
Whoa.
Wow.

18:09.422 --> 18:12.346
Okay, I got it for 18.99,
but it's a good one.

18:17.138 --> 18:18.731
Fun night, right?
Yes.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.646
Great dinner.
Yes.

18:20.725 --> 18:22.819
And Tad is great,

18:22.935 --> 18:25.358
and I know I was giving
you a hard time- Hey.

18:25.479 --> 18:27.732
Hey, hey, Claire. but I feel like
I should say that I'm sorry.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.988
You don't need to explain.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.944
Your apology
is apology enough-.

18:32.028 --> 18:34.497
Oh, I forgot the best part
of the Costa Rica story.

18:34.572 --> 18:37.917
So we get home, and they've
taken over the living room.

18:37.992 --> 18:39.619
They've taken over the kitchen.

18:39.702 --> 18:42.125
I mean, they're in the food.
They're on the bed.

18:42.204 --> 18:45.754
And finally, after two years of
complaining to Diego about this,

18:45.833 --> 18:47.460
he finally stops and says,

18:47.543 --> 18:52.049
"Okay, now I see it. You
do have a monkey problem."

18:57.887 --> 19:01.187
A monkey problem! Yeah, I
heard him the first time.

19:01.265 --> 19:05.691
You can kiss my wife, you can take her
to bed, but you cannot make her laugh.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.649
I want to go back.

19:09.732 --> 19:11.279
You can kiss my wife,

19:11.359 --> 19:14.158
but only I can take her to bed
and make her laugh.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.785
I want to go back.

19:16.864 --> 19:21.745
Only I can take my wife
to bed, comma,

19:21.827 --> 19:23.579
and make her laugh.

19:24.955 --> 19:27.504
I mean,
they were in everything.

19:27.583 --> 19:30.086
The only thing they didn't
the bananas.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.674
Monkeys love bananas!

19:34.799 --> 19:37.723
You would think they would love the bananas!
Yeah, we should go.

19:37.843 --> 19:40.221
They'd want the bananas. Yeah, we need to go.
We gotta get goin'.

19:40.346 --> 19:41.643
Oh, no, no, no.
Yeah, we're late.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.437
But we just opened the- We're
late for getting home.

19:43.557 --> 19:44.774
We're having-
Let's go.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.189
Okay.  Okay.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.736
What is wrong with you?

19:47.853 --> 19:49.855
You laughed like it was
"Who's on first?" What?

19:49.939 --> 19:51.907
He's on second.
Don't try to cheer me up.

19:51.982 --> 19:53.655
I know what's going on here.
You're jealous.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.078
Of him?
Uh-huh.

19:56.153 --> 19:59.373
He's not even funny. What's he
got, like a soft 10 minutes?

19:59.448 --> 20:02.042
And he goes to the Costa Rican well
a little too much for my taste.

20:02.118 --> 20:04.291
Oh, God.

20:04.412 --> 20:07.040
Really? This is still about the monkeys?
No, no, no, no.

20:07.123 --> 20:10.218
It's you. You are making
me so happy right now.

20:10.292 --> 20:13.216
You stormed out of there, and
you're acting like an idiot.

20:13.295 --> 20:16.219
You like this? Because I'm
really uncomfortable.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.845
Honey, I love it.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.393
Makes me feel special.

20:19.468 --> 20:22.017
Sometimes I really don't
understand you.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.894
I know it's stupid,

20:23.973 --> 20:26.271
but it's nice to know that
sometimes you'll fight for me,

20:26.350 --> 20:29.604
and all I have to do is laugh
at some other guy's story.

20:29.687 --> 20:32.315
But no one makes me laugh
like you do.

20:33.691 --> 20:35.659
As long as it's always genuine.
Mm-hmm.

20:35.735 --> 20:38.864
You can fake anything you want
with me, but not your laugh.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.661
I'd like to go back.
Yeah.

20:44.702 --> 20:46.249
Stop it! Leave me alone!

20:46.328 --> 20:48.422
- Oh, hold still!
- Stop moving!

20:48.497 --> 20:49.840
I hate you! Get off me!

20:49.915 --> 20:51.838
What is going on?

20:53.419 --> 20:55.421
You guys are in a lot
of trouble.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.097
Haley, I told you
to clean this mess up.

20:57.173 --> 20:58.766
And, Alex,
your books are everywhere.

20:58.841 --> 21:01.185
Betty Luke, sit down
while your dad gets the camera.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.352
Got it.

21:03.304 --> 21:04.772
Last time,
you made a funny face ...

21:04.847 --> 21:06.474
and we didn't really get
a good shot,

21:06.557 --> 21:08.059
so let's work on our smile.

21:08.142 --> 21:10.520
Okay. Good to see you,
Betty Luke.
