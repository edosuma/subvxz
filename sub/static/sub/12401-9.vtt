Take it easy.

02:51.038 --> 02:52.771
        What do you want, Byron?

02:52.773 --> 02:54.540
I came to say goodbye.

02:54.542 --> 02:55.641
           Bullshit.

02:55.643 --> 02:56.975
       You came to gloat.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.710
Now, you know
good and well

02:58.712 --> 03:02.314
I'm too old and tired
to get caught up in pride.

03:02.316 --> 03:05.384
I didn't ask you to leave
because I wanted to.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.486
       You didn't ask me
       to do anything.

03:07.488 --> 03:09.454
But what I did for you,

03:09.456 --> 03:12.291
  I wouldn't do
  for anyone else.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.393
I gave you
what you wanted.

03:14.395 --> 03:17.729
A chance
for you and Kat to...

03:17.731 --> 03:19.798
keep on keepin' on.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.301
              You had any sense,

03:22.303 --> 03:25.237
you'd have been running
Anderson and Barnes out of town,

03:25.239 --> 03:27.873
   instead of betraying
   your best friend of 20 years.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.374
              The one person

03:29.376 --> 03:31.510
    who could have protected you
    from what's comin'.

03:31.512 --> 03:33.545
  And what is that?

03:33.547 --> 03:36.548
                 (chuckles)
No, you got something to say,

03:36.550 --> 03:38.083
     come on out
     and say it.

03:38.085 --> 03:40.852
       You got things
       all turned around, Byron.

03:40.854 --> 03:43.222
           None of this is
           what you think it is.

03:43.224 --> 03:44.690
       Gettin' rid of one of 'em

03:44.692 --> 03:47.192

                           Babe?

03:48.996 --> 03:51.463
        We should get going.
LENNY: I'm comin'.

03:52.765 --> 03:56.368
   You know how bad traffic gets
   on the interstate.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.437
             I said I'll be
             right there, honey.

04:00.573 --> 04:03.041
     Do yourself a favor, Byron.

04:03.043 --> 04:05.677
           Stay clear of things
           you don't understand.

04:05.679 --> 04:09.448
Be a real shame if something bad
happened to you.

              why don't you, uh,

04:26.300 --> 04:28.934
            have a seat here
            where I can see you.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.535
             I'll be right back.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.639
      Is everything okay, Daddy?

04:34.741 --> 04:36.808
Yeah, it's okay.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.744
Better than okay.

04:38.746 --> 04:40.646
It's perfect, just like you.

05:05.572 --> 05:07.139
This is West Virginia.

05:07.141 --> 05:08.940
I'm still allowed
to shoot you.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.909
     We just went by the school.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.678
    They say you called in sick.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.479
Well, that's what
normal people do

05:14.481 --> 05:15.847
when they're not feeling well.

05:17.784 --> 05:19.084
              What happened
              to your hand?

05:19.086 --> 05:21.320
        I broke a glass.

05:23.489 --> 05:26.291
    Oh, it was an accident.

05:26.293 --> 05:28.260
         Was it really?

05:28.262 --> 05:30.529
I could really do
without the judgments right now.

05:30.531 --> 05:31.830
            I'm not judging you.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.399
        Then what are you doin'?
  Hey.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.136
Checking in on you, shithead,

05:38.138 --> 05:39.805
like you did for me.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.039
                (sighs)

05:42.008 --> 05:44.776
Mark's gonna find another job.

05:44.778 --> 05:48.680
Donnie, he'll crumble
when the truth comes out.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.282
         You...

05:50.284 --> 05:53.352
need to quit beatin' on yourself
for things you can't change.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.888
             That's good advice.

05:57.890 --> 05:59.057
          I liked it much better

05:59.059 --> 06:01.793
         the hundred times
         I was giving it to you.

06:03.396 --> 06:06.565
        Yeah, well, just
        be glad I listened.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.633
        (scoffs)
        Finally.

06:09.802 --> 06:10.902
          KYLE: (sighs)

06:12.905 --> 06:14.606
          Megan, I need a favor.

06:16.976 --> 06:18.877
                  Amber's, uh...

06:18.879 --> 06:19.911
       she's having a hard time.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.380
                  She's...

06:21.382 --> 06:24.149
                  confused.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.685
        I think she needs
        to just start acting
        like a normal kid again.

06:26.687 --> 06:30.255
You want me to get
her enrolled in my school?

06:30.257 --> 06:33.091
          Figure maybe you could
          pull some strings.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.127
Without anybody
asking questions?

06:36.162 --> 06:37.329
Okay.

06:37.331 --> 06:38.930
I'll see what I can do.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.399
                Thanks.

06:41.501 --> 06:43.668
Have you heard from Allison?

06:45.405 --> 06:47.038
                 No.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.441
     I'm tired of waiting around
     by the phone.

06:50.543 --> 06:52.844
What are you gonna do?

06:52.846 --> 06:54.980
             I'm gonna go out
             and find her.

06:57.617 --> 06:59.418
   (distant thunder rumbling)

06:59.420 --> 07:00.819

07:07.794 --> 07:09.127
                         John?

07:14.901 --> 07:18.069
           You know, when my son
           was about 13,

07:18.071 --> 07:20.739
               he got kicked out
               of school.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.374
              Really?

07:22.376 --> 07:24.042
               Well, not exactly
               kicked out.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.644
                He got suspended
                for a few days.

07:25.646 --> 07:29.247
There was this kid
in his class teasing him,

07:29.249 --> 07:33.652
and, so, Matthew waited
'til after school...

07:33.654 --> 07:35.287
gave him
a real ass whoopin'.

07:36.722 --> 07:39.458
        Fighter like his father.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.193
I told him
he'd embarrassed me.

07:42.895 --> 07:44.996
             That he was the son
             of a preacher man.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.731
               He needed to get
               his shit together

07:46.733 --> 07:48.300
      and start acting like one.

07:52.104 --> 07:54.940
     Wonder what
     he would have made of my...

07:54.942 --> 07:56.708
                little show
                the other night.

07:59.011 --> 08:00.645
Well, I think
he probably would say

08:00.647 --> 08:02.647
what I'm about to say.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.716
Get your shit together.

08:06.185 --> 08:07.752
 (chuckles)

08:12.158 --> 08:13.758
             I want you
             to move in with me.

08:17.096 --> 08:18.964
         Tricia--
                Don't worry.

08:18.966 --> 08:22.467
             I'm not looking
             for a crutch.

08:22.469 --> 08:25.103
            I just want
            some normalcy.

08:28.307 --> 08:31.176
You know that
people are talking about us.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.280
               Fuck 'em.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.723
     (children chattering)

08:53.032 --> 08:55.567
      (whispers)
      Hey, you know what?

08:56.736 --> 08:58.203
         Everyone says

08:58.205 --> 09:01.773
    she's the nicest teacher
    in the whole school.

09:05.077 --> 09:07.546
     I wanna stay with you.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.554
 Look, Amber...

09:17.557 --> 09:22.360
      you've been through
      a lot of changes recently,

09:22.362 --> 09:25.330
            and that ain't fair,
            I know that.

09:25.332 --> 09:26.998
              But I'm gonna
              make it up to you.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.036
          I swear, I'm gonna get
          things back to normal.

09:31.038 --> 09:34.639
You're gonna look
for Mommy, aren't you?

09:37.076 --> 09:39.010
                  Yeah, I am.

09:40.513 --> 09:43.181
           I know it makes you
           nervous, baby, but...

09:43.183 --> 09:46.384
           you'll see,
           once we get her home.

09:46.386 --> 09:48.253
           It's for the best.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.421
           We'll be a family.

09:49.423 --> 09:51.289
            No one can ever
            hurt us again.

09:52.525 --> 09:53.892
       You're lyin'.

09:53.894 --> 09:55.760
            Why do you say that?

09:55.762 --> 09:57.762
'Cause that's what grownups do.

10:01.734 --> 10:03.368
                   Look...

10:03.370 --> 10:07.439
 if you promise you make
 a good go of it at this school,

10:07.441 --> 10:11.042
           I promise I won't lie
           to you about Mommy

10:11.044 --> 10:13.411
          or anything else ever.

10:13.413 --> 10:15.614
        That's the honest truth.

10:17.249 --> 10:18.783
       I promise.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.852
            Oh, thank you, baby.

10:25.391 --> 10:27.892
           (rattling)

10:34.433 --> 10:36.468
Good morning, Florence.

10:36.470 --> 10:38.837
              Reverend Anderson.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.739
I just need a few minutes
of your time.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.407
        Oh, I'm sorry, Reverend,

10:42.409 --> 10:44.409
            I'm already
            really running late.

10:44.411 --> 10:45.910
 Florence, please.

10:45.912 --> 10:48.647
               If anyone sees me
               talking to you...

10:48.649 --> 10:50.649
You and I, we've been
on the front line

10:50.651 --> 10:51.983
for as long as I can remember,

10:51.985 --> 10:55.453
and together we've helped
so many of our neighbors.

10:55.455 --> 10:58.089
You know, the-- the truth is
I don't have many friends left.

10:59.158 --> 11:01.026
And all I can do now
is rely on those

11:01.028 --> 11:03.028
that still believe
in my work.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.230
Who may still believe in me.

11:08.300 --> 11:09.934
            Well, what can I do?

11:09.936 --> 11:13.038
You could tell me what
the deacons are saying about me.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.807
What they're thinkin'.

11:15.809 --> 11:19.511
    They're meetin' at noon
    to discuss your replacement.

11:32.224 --> 11:33.525
   I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.694
          You want anything
          from the store?

11:35.696 --> 11:37.529
  Somethin' salty.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.497
        No, your blood pressure
        is already high enough.

11:39.499 --> 11:42.367
            How about a nice,
            tasty apple?

11:42.369 --> 11:43.935
       Sounds delicious.

11:49.008 --> 11:51.042
          (urinating)

11:55.514 --> 11:57.415
                (knock on door)

11:57.417 --> 11:59.417
Just a second.

12:01.187 --> 12:03.088
I said just a second!

12:03.090 --> 12:06.091
       (footsteps approaching)
                (door closes)

12:16.001 --> 12:17.469
        (toilet flushes)

12:19.839 --> 12:22.173
                SIDNEY:
                Aren't you gonna
                wash your hands?

12:28.881 --> 12:30.582
What are you doin' here?

12:30.584 --> 12:33.284
            You left without
            saying goodbye.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.754
 Well, I couldn't.

12:35.756 --> 12:37.155
Giles was watchin'.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.593
           I suppose some things
           are just...

12:41.595 --> 12:43.795
             out of our control.

12:45.030 --> 12:48.433
         I wish everybody showed
         your initiative, Kat.

12:49.969 --> 12:52.604
       I have a new job for you.

12:59.445 --> 13:00.979
                 Mark!

13:00.981 --> 13:02.747
         Hey.

13:02.749 --> 13:04.382
     Megan told me
     what happened.

13:04.384 --> 13:07.418
      I'm sorry.
      Yeah, it ain't
      my proudest moment, but...

13:07.420 --> 13:09.587
            you know,
            life goes on, right?

13:09.589 --> 13:11.322
    Look, I know
    my timing's awful,

13:11.324 --> 13:14.726
but I don't really know
what else to do.

13:14.728 --> 13:15.927
         About Allison?

13:15.929 --> 13:17.896
       Yeah.

13:17.898 --> 13:21.432
 You know, sometimes people just
 need time to sort stuff out.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.568
                      What if...

13:23.570 --> 13:25.136
                   What if this
                   is different?

13:25.138 --> 13:26.271
                    What if...

13:26.273 --> 13:28.139
               something else?

13:28.141 --> 13:29.340
               She might...

13:29.342 --> 13:32.777
What, you think
she might hurt herself?

13:32.779 --> 13:35.280
       I don't know, but, Mark,
       I can't take that chance.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.182
      Would you if it was Megan?

13:38.918 --> 13:40.585
When was the last time
you were at her house?

13:41.687 --> 13:43.254
            Yesterday.
            There was no answer.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.689
What, you didn't go inside?

13:44.691 --> 13:46.758
I got the restraining order. I--

13:48.360 --> 13:50.595
All right, well, if you
don't say nothin', I won't.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.997
Come on.
I'll follow you.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.365
                    All right.

14:16.622 --> 14:17.755
            (sighs)

14:31.003 --> 14:33.104
       (muffled chatter)

14:40.813 --> 14:42.814
       MAN:
       The storm in Roanoke
       when I was--

14:44.884 --> 14:46.050
         (door closes)

14:47.152 --> 14:48.419
Pardon the interruption.

14:50.089 --> 14:51.823
           But before you all
           make a grave mistake,

14:51.825 --> 14:53.258
       I would like to be heard.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.260
           (scoffs)
I believe I've earned
that right at least.

14:55.262 --> 14:57.495
             This is a private
             church meeting.

14:59.765 --> 15:01.733
        I am this church, Tansy.

15:02.768 --> 15:05.003
        I built it from nothin'.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.572
  Laid the foundations of my own
  blood, sweat, and tears,

15:07.574 --> 15:09.007
      and you damn well know it.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.710
      Now, at some point,
      every one of you

15:12.712 --> 15:14.612
    has come to me
    for spiritual guidance,

15:14.614 --> 15:16.481
      and I've always been there
      to provide it.

15:17.683 --> 15:20.118
        Now, I implore you

15:20.120 --> 15:21.986
      to place your trust
      in me now.

15:21.988 --> 15:23.755
          I implore you

15:23.757 --> 15:27.125
      to believe that my actions
      are in your best interest

15:27.127 --> 15:28.693
               and that of this
               entire community.

15:28.695 --> 15:31.462
  The way they always have been,
  the way they always will be.

15:31.464 --> 15:32.897
      John, John!

15:32.899 --> 15:34.766
You should leave now.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.167
                SIDNEY:
                Yes, Reverend...

15:37.436 --> 15:39.003
you really should go.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.107
                  The hell is
                  he doing here?

15:44.276 --> 15:47.045
Do you have any idea
what you have done

15:47.047 --> 15:49.247
inviting the devil
into God's house?

15:49.249 --> 15:52.250
               FLORENCE: Oh, no.
Sidney has come
to make a donation.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.319
     His decision
     to forgive your insults

15:54.321 --> 15:57.221
    should be a lesson
    in kindness and charity.

15:57.223 --> 15:58.990
        ANDERSON:
        How can you be so blind?

15:58.992 --> 16:01.426
          This man is pretending
          to be one of us,
          but he is not!

16:01.428 --> 16:02.760
John, that's it!
            He is not one of us!

16:02.762 --> 16:04.829
  That is enough
  out of you!
          I will not allow you

16:04.831 --> 16:07.498
      to poison anymore souls
      with your hatred and bile!

16:07.500 --> 16:11.135
I think you have
the wrong impression
of me, Reverend.

16:11.137 --> 16:14.038
I'm not some kind of monster.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.240
         What are you?

16:16.242 --> 16:17.775
Well, just a man,

16:17.777 --> 16:19.911
trying to live as...

16:19.913 --> 16:22.981
    as righteous a life
    as I can.

16:22.983 --> 16:26.684
Now, I'm sorry
if that offends you, but...

16:26.686 --> 16:29.087
maybe you're the one
who needs to be reminded

16:29.089 --> 16:32.690
what it means to be
a... a good Christian.

16:33.692 --> 16:35.126
                   FLORENCE:
                   Reverend, no!

16:35.128 --> 16:37.261
                       MAN:
                       Chaplain!

16:37.263 --> 16:38.329
        Oh, stop!

16:39.765 --> 16:40.832
                      Reverend!

17:04.123 --> 17:05.522
What were you thinking?

17:06.992 --> 17:08.826
I came to get my job back.

17:08.828 --> 17:10.560
             Hell of a strategy.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.131
It's exactly what he wanted.

17:14.665 --> 17:16.800
To get his ass kicked?

17:16.803 --> 17:19.303
        To isolate and embarrass
        me even further.

17:20.506 --> 17:21.973
It's been his plan all along.

17:21.974 --> 17:23.340
         Well, if you knew that,

17:23.343 --> 17:25.410
then why'd you fall for it?

17:29.014 --> 17:32.450
 It's not every day you get
 to punch the devil in the face.

17:34.253 --> 17:35.319
            (chuckles)

17:36.722 --> 17:38.256
Why isn't he in handcuffs?

17:41.493 --> 17:43.261
   Look, mister.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.263
Since there's
no real harm done,

17:45.265 --> 17:50.601
I suggest we forgo
all the usual legal formalities.

17:53.872 --> 17:55.907
           Why would we do that?

17:55.909 --> 17:57.575
   That man there,

17:57.577 --> 18:00.845
I've known for the better part
of 20 years.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.680
But you...

18:02.682 --> 18:05.183
you, I don't know from Adam.

18:05.185 --> 18:08.186
Now, I warned you once
about messing with my friends.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.420
Don't make me show you

18:09.422 --> 18:12.423
just how little patience
I really have.

18:16.195 --> 18:18.729
        I want to press charges.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.364
            I want him arrested.

18:22.067 --> 18:23.634
     It's okay, Chief.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.436
  You can get me out of here.

18:33.979 --> 18:36.547
(handcuffs clicking)

18:55.834 --> 18:59.070
  One of the perks
  of not being a cop anymore.

18:59.072 --> 19:00.738
                 After you.

19:15.120 --> 19:16.521
Why don't you go upstairs?

19:16.523 --> 19:18.322
I'll check around down here.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.390
                      Yeah.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.565
                    (clattering)

19:30.302 --> 19:31.569
Allison!

19:37.309 --> 19:39.043
     (clattering continues)

19:45.817 --> 19:47.351
            Allison!

19:47.353 --> 19:48.619
     Allison, let me in.

19:48.621 --> 19:49.954
                    (clattering)

20:12.678 --> 20:14.111
         (sighs)

20:27.559 --> 20:29.260
MARK:
Kyle?

20:31.863 --> 20:33.464
        She's not here.

20:34.566 --> 20:37.201
You been through hell
on this, and...

20:37.203 --> 20:39.270
I may have been
too hard on you.

20:39.272 --> 20:41.339
       Just protecting
       your family, Mark.

20:41.341 --> 20:42.506
        It's all right.

20:42.508 --> 20:43.674
(phone vibrates)

20:43.676 --> 20:46.143
Amazing how far
a man will go to do that.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.646
    This is Mark.

20:51.583 --> 20:52.650
        Yep.

20:53.619 --> 20:55.519
   Well, thank you.

20:56.855 --> 20:59.790
That was the school nurse.

20:59.792 --> 21:01.926
Guess Megan went home.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.194
                  Is she okay?

21:03.196 --> 21:06.631
I guess she's got
some sort of stomach bug.

21:06.633 --> 21:09.200
I'm gonna head home,
see if she's okay.

21:09.202 --> 21:11.068
          I'm worried about her.

21:11.070 --> 21:13.371
        She hasn't been herself.

21:13.373 --> 21:15.273
Well, she'll pull through.

21:15.275 --> 21:18.276
She's been through worse.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.311
Hell, you both have.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.614
All right,
I'll call you later.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.016
                Mark?

21:28.153 --> 21:29.453
                   Thanks.

21:37.796 --> 21:40.998
              <i> ¶ ¶</i>

22:45.364 --> 22:46.797
(clattering)

22:48.900 --> 22:50.267
            Allison!

22:53.405 --> 22:54.538
Lauren.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.207
Wait.

22:57.409 --> 22:58.642
                        Wait!

22:58.644 --> 23:00.244
                   Wait.

23:01.646 --> 23:02.980
            Lauren, please wait!

23:02.982 --> 23:04.315
        No.

23:05.250 --> 23:07.051
            Just let me explain.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.720
I'm calling the police, Kyle.
                      No, don't.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.489
            Listen to what
            I have to say first.

23:11.491 --> 23:13.891
     Allison left Amber with me.

23:13.893 --> 23:15.092
 I know.

23:15.094 --> 23:16.694
              Wait a minute.

23:16.696 --> 23:18.362
           You've spoken to her?

23:18.364 --> 23:20.097
               Where is she?

23:20.099 --> 23:22.032
She doesn't want to see you.

23:22.034 --> 23:23.534
    That doesn't make any sense.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.035
            She came back to me.

23:25.037 --> 23:28.305
And my daughter
was very confused.

23:29.508 --> 23:31.709
             She's not afraid
             of me anymore.
No.

23:31.711 --> 23:33.878
 She's afraid of herself.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.746
     I blame you for that.

23:35.748 --> 23:38.682
I don't know
what happened that day,

23:38.684 --> 23:40.885
but it changed
my beautiful baby girl

23:40.887 --> 23:43.521
into someone
I barely recognize.

23:43.523 --> 23:46.457
I just want
the real Allison back.

23:46.459 --> 23:47.992
            So do I.

23:49.861 --> 23:51.595
            Just tell me
            where she is.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.097
                Please.

24:20.892 --> 24:22.126
What, that's it?

24:22.128 --> 24:23.461
           That's it.

24:24.896 --> 24:26.597
Are you sure?

24:26.599 --> 24:28.999
I mean, I can't stop
until I've seen this through.

24:30.068 --> 24:32.102
          When you get jammed up
          out there,

24:32.104 --> 24:33.671
        you give me a call.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.172
        I'll come runnin'.

24:40.679 --> 24:42.480
(door opens)

24:42.482 --> 24:43.848
(door closes)

24:50.789 --> 24:52.356
          KAT: (sighs)

24:52.358 --> 24:54.024
         He was right.

24:54.026 --> 24:56.093
        This is perfect!

24:57.162 --> 24:58.762
                    I don't know
                    about this.

24:58.764 --> 25:00.498
     Oh, what's not to know?

25:00.500 --> 25:03.767
       Everything we need
       is all right here!

25:06.004 --> 25:07.805
                   Why you, Kat?

25:07.807 --> 25:09.039
                         Why us?

25:09.041 --> 25:11.308
          Why not us?

25:11.310 --> 25:15.112
Don't you think we deserve
this responsibility?

25:16.281 --> 25:18.382
        Watchin' after
        a few folks in the woods

25:18.384 --> 25:20.851
             is one thing,
             but this...

25:20.853 --> 25:22.453
          Why can't he do it?

25:24.289 --> 25:25.523
                 Ohh.

25:25.525 --> 25:28.893
There somethin' wonderful
comin', sweetheart,

25:28.895 --> 25:35.199
and this is our part
that we've been chosen to play.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.368
        You know I'd do anything
        for you, babe.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.304
   But none of this feels right.

25:42.240 --> 25:45.376
               We can get in
               the car right now

25:45.378 --> 25:47.678
        and go anywhere we want.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.346
          Leave all this behind.

25:49.348 --> 25:51.148
                Just you and me.

25:53.852 --> 25:55.719
You do what you have to.

25:56.855 --> 25:59.290
There is no you and me
without this.

26:14.839 --> 26:18.709
        If... if Giles finds out
        we haven't left town...

26:18.711 --> 26:21.078
Giles chose the wrong side.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.247
He'll get what's coming
to him soon enough.

26:23.249 --> 26:25.549
            What about Anderson?

26:25.551 --> 26:28.352
            And Barnes?
            We got real lucky
            with them last time.

26:29.688 --> 26:32.756
Luck had nothing
to do with that.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.858
 You rescued me.

26:34.860 --> 26:36.594
    You.

26:36.596 --> 26:38.295
(giggles)

26:38.297 --> 26:41.465
Come to think of it...

26:41.467 --> 26:45.402
I never had a chance to...

26:45.404 --> 26:46.904
show my appreciation.

26:46.906 --> 26:48.339
              Hm?

26:49.941 --> 26:51.208
            Hm?
              (breathes heavily)

26:51.210 --> 26:52.743
            Hm?

26:52.745 --> 26:54.478
        You trust me, babe?

26:54.480 --> 26:55.813
                        Yes.

26:55.815 --> 26:59.850
Then you have absolutely
nothin' to worry about.

27:07.592 --> 27:09.627
You puked in front
of the whole school?

27:09.629 --> 27:10.761
                 (sighs)

27:10.763 --> 27:13.464
                 I've never been
                 so embarrassed.

27:15.100 --> 27:17.201
                 Oh, baby.

27:19.804 --> 27:22.506
      Are you okay?
                    No, Mark.

27:22.508 --> 27:25.476
                I'm the opposite
                of okay.

27:25.478 --> 27:27.277
             What if the charges
             against you stick?

27:27.279 --> 27:28.612
       What if you go to prison?

27:28.614 --> 27:30.114
    That's not gonna happen.

27:30.116 --> 27:32.416
            How are you so sure?

27:32.418 --> 27:34.752
       I'm just trying
       to stay positive.

27:34.754 --> 27:35.853
              (chuckles)

27:35.855 --> 27:38.088
For both of us.
               (chuckles)

27:39.758 --> 27:41.592
     You may need to try harder.

27:45.697 --> 27:47.364
         I'm pregnant.

27:52.470 --> 27:55.105
      It's like some kind
      of sick joke.

27:56.808 --> 27:58.008
                         (sighs)

28:03.148 --> 28:05.883
   Maybe you're just not looking
   at this the right way.

28:06.985 --> 28:08.952
     What's the right way, Mark?

28:08.954 --> 28:12.056
    This the absolute worst time
    this could happen.

28:12.058 --> 28:13.891
            Any way you spin it,

28:13.893 --> 28:15.259
                   we're fucked.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.532
      I'll call the doctor
      in the mornin',

28:21.534 --> 28:22.633
    have it taken care of.

28:22.635 --> 28:24.301
Hey, hey, sweetie, come on.

28:25.904 --> 28:28.072
You don't gotta do that.

28:29.007 --> 28:31.375
        Baby...

28:31.377 --> 28:33.377
this is a sign, Megan...

28:34.813 --> 28:37.514
that everything's gonna
be all right.

28:37.516 --> 28:39.783
That we're supposed to go on
living our lives.

28:42.087 --> 28:44.121
              Have you forgotten
              what it's like?

28:45.090 --> 28:47.591
           Babies need car seats
           and diapers

28:47.593 --> 28:51.028
     and doctor visits, formula.

28:51.030 --> 28:53.063
         Mm-hmm.
            With one salary,

28:53.065 --> 28:55.265
      w-- we can barely afford
      the bills we already have.

28:55.267 --> 28:57.935
Yeah, well, it's a good thing
I got a job interview tomorrow.

28:57.937 --> 29:00.838
             Wait, what?
        Yeah.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.606
They need
another security guard

29:02.608 --> 29:03.907
down at the mill.

29:05.376 --> 29:08.145
Baby, I'm due
for some good luck.

29:10.949 --> 29:13.717
              Are you sure
              we should do this?

29:13.719 --> 29:15.119
     Baby...

29:16.521 --> 29:18.355
this is a clean slate for us.

29:19.457 --> 29:20.991
   A fresh start.

29:26.264 --> 29:27.598
                      Wow.

29:28.633 --> 29:30.801
             I'm gonna be a mom!

29:32.303 --> 29:34.772
                 Again.
        (both chuckle)

29:36.775 --> 29:39.209
Maybe after this one,
we can try for a third, huh?

29:39.211 --> 29:41.879
              Oh, don't make
              me hurt you!
      Come here.

29:43.047 --> 29:44.348
       Come here.

30:04.769 --> 30:06.136
        (elevator dings)

30:17.182 --> 30:18.549
           Yes, sir.

30:25.957 --> 30:27.591
            Yes, sir. All right.

30:28.626 --> 30:29.993
                 Can I help you?

30:31.029 --> 30:33.030
  Uh, I need to see a patient.

30:33.032 --> 30:34.965
      Allison Barnes.

30:34.967 --> 30:39.002
              We have a strict
              no-visitor policy.

30:39.004 --> 30:42.005
      Ma'am, I broke into
      my own house today,

30:42.007 --> 30:43.874
   convinced I was gonna find
   the love of my life

30:43.876 --> 30:46.944
      hanging from a rope
      and afraid of how

30:46.946 --> 30:50.013
    I was gonna explain that
    to our little girl.

30:51.516 --> 30:55.452
If there was ever a time
to break the rules, this is it.

30:56.888 --> 30:58.288
               Please.

31:00.225 --> 31:02.693
    Allison was
    particularly agitated
    when she checked herself in.

31:02.695 --> 31:04.561
           We've been giving her
           a sedative.

31:05.496 --> 31:08.198
    Something to help her relax.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.466
Wait right here.

31:14.639 --> 31:16.073
                (whimpering)

31:17.475 --> 31:18.909
WOMAN:
Mr. Barnes.

31:18.911 --> 31:21.144
Mr. Barnes.

31:21.146 --> 31:22.479
You can have a few minutes.

31:37.996 --> 31:39.830
Allison. Hey, baby.

31:52.277 --> 31:55.445
There's so many things
I need to tell you.

31:55.447 --> 31:57.848
Things I should have told you
a long time ago.

31:59.017 --> 32:00.751
 And I wanted to.

32:00.753 --> 32:03.420
The other night
on the porch, I did.

32:05.523 --> 32:06.990
I just didn't know how.

32:10.461 --> 32:12.496
And I didn't want this.

32:17.735 --> 32:20.771
What happened to us that day
wasn't your fault.

32:24.375 --> 32:26.476
  My mother

32:26.478 --> 32:27.744
     wasn't sick, Allison.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.980
       She wasn't bipolar
       like they said.

32:31.616 --> 32:34.651
       She had somethin'
       inside of her.

32:34.653 --> 32:37.621
Something controllin' her.

32:37.623 --> 32:39.823
And I don't know why, but...

32:39.825 --> 32:42.459
they seem to choose
the people that I love.

32:46.331 --> 32:47.965
      I think it's
      'cause they need me,

32:47.967 --> 32:50.200
      we're connected
      or somethin'.

32:53.071 --> 32:54.738
        I know how
        this all sounds.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.239
           It's true.

32:58.009 --> 32:59.443
    But there's hope, baby.

32:59.445 --> 33:02.112
I can stop them.

33:02.114 --> 33:04.448
I can draw
these things out of people

33:04.450 --> 33:06.984
and make 'em go away,
and, baby, that's...

33:06.986 --> 33:08.986
that's what I did that day.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.488
To the one that
was inside of you.

33:11.490 --> 33:12.856
    It's gone.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.492
  Okay? You're not sick.

33:17.328 --> 33:19.930
    You're not dangerous
    to anybody anymore.

33:21.099 --> 33:23.767
I want you
to come home, baby.

33:23.769 --> 33:27.971
I want you
to come home to a family.

33:27.973 --> 33:29.539
          Our family.

33:32.777 --> 33:34.778
     You don't belong here.

33:41.319 --> 33:44.788
   You are the kindest,
   gentlest man I've ever known.

33:46.557 --> 33:50.460
               But, baby,
               you can't protect
               me anymore.

33:50.462 --> 33:53.463
     Baby, that's not true.
                Not from myself.

33:54.532 --> 33:57.067
    You need to move on. Please.

33:58.169 --> 34:01.171
          You need to be the one
          to raise Amber now.

34:01.173 --> 34:02.873
                    Not me.

34:03.908 --> 34:05.308
                         Not us.

34:05.310 --> 34:06.676
       Baby--

34:06.678 --> 34:08.145
              No.

34:09.213 --> 34:10.480
   Please.
                Wait.

34:13.818 --> 34:15.385
           Baby, no.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.721
         (both crying)

34:17.723 --> 34:19.822
       I love you, baby. Please.

34:21.059 --> 34:22.993
                  Wait.

34:26.931 --> 34:29.632
              <i> ¶ ¶</i>

35:11.209 --> 35:12.776
(moped stops)

35:32.163 --> 35:33.730
SIDNEY:
(speaking indistinctly)

35:36.667 --> 35:38.702
         (line ringing)

35:43.141 --> 35:44.307
       MEGAN (on phone):
       <i> Hey.</i>

35:44.309 --> 35:46.109
                 Hey. It's me.

35:46.111 --> 35:48.111
You sound terrible.

35:48.113 --> 35:49.880
                      KYLE:
                      <i> Thanks.</i>

35:51.249 --> 35:52.749
                 How's Amber?

35:52.751 --> 35:54.017
 MEGAN:
 <i> You were right</i>
 <i> about school.</i>

35:54.019 --> 35:57.020
She made
three new friends today.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.690
               That's great.

36:01.659 --> 36:03.393
 Any news on Allison?

36:06.030 --> 36:08.265
                No. Nothin'.

36:10.101 --> 36:11.701
  Don't give up, Kyle.

36:11.703 --> 36:14.771
If anybody deserves
a happy ending to their story,

36:14.773 --> 36:15.939
           it's you.

36:15.941 --> 36:19.209
     Uh, thought I'd say, uh...

36:19.211 --> 36:22.345
 I might be a couple hours
 before I can come and get her.
 Is that all right?

36:24.115 --> 36:25.849
   Well, she's welcome
   to stay the night.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.951
 The girls would love
 a slumber party.

36:27.953 --> 36:29.219
    <i> Thanks.</i>
    <i> That's all right. I...</i>

36:30.721 --> 36:32.889
          I'd like for her to be
          under my roof tonight.

36:32.891 --> 36:34.357
                  You know?

36:34.359 --> 36:37.561
<i>Give the firefly a little kiss</i>
<i>on the head for me, will you?</i>

36:37.563 --> 36:39.196
 <i> Tell her I'll see her soon.</i>

36:39.198 --> 36:40.330
            Will do.

36:40.332 --> 36:42.199
                  Thanks, Megan.

36:42.201 --> 36:43.767
      <i> Sure. Bye.</i>

37:01.185 --> 37:04.287
              <i> ¶ ¶</i>

38:06.917 --> 38:08.251
    What is this?

38:08.253 --> 38:10.053
Where have you been?
         Out.

38:11.889 --> 38:13.657
       Just answer the question.

38:13.659 --> 38:15.425
        Bite me.
      Aaron!

38:15.427 --> 38:17.961
I saw you with Sidney.

38:17.963 --> 38:19.262
            So what?

38:19.264 --> 38:20.797
             Now, I need
             to know everything.

38:20.799 --> 38:21.831
              No.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.833
Aaron!

38:23.835 --> 38:25.468
I don't want you going near
that man ever again.

38:25.470 --> 38:27.170
He is very dangerous.
            Why?

38:27.172 --> 38:29.773
     Because the asshole
     you're boning says so?

38:29.775 --> 38:31.408
       Don't you dare speak
       to your mother like that.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.310
   Yeah, what are you
   gonna do about it?

38:33.312 --> 38:36.813
   You know what?
   I should take a damn belt
   to that smart mouth of yours!

38:36.815 --> 38:38.515
   Teach you some
   goddamn manners!
John!

38:38.517 --> 38:40.517
  Don't let him hurt me!
              You have to leave.
              You have to leave!

38:40.519 --> 38:42.185
   He's playing you.
            Mom!

38:42.187 --> 38:44.020
            Get out of my house.

38:48.759 --> 38:50.694
            Please? Just go!

38:51.829 --> 38:53.263
He's playing you, Patricia.
                    Please.

39:21.392 --> 39:23.059
        (engine starts)

39:41.479 --> 39:44.881
     My father used to beat
     the crap out of me.

39:44.883 --> 39:46.883
          Did the same
          to my mom.

39:49.653 --> 39:52.655
      I guess this means
      you won't be coming
      around here anymore.

39:55.092 --> 39:58.261
   Oh! Yeah, I almost forgot.

39:58.263 --> 40:02.565
  Sidney says that
  you're too late to stop it.

40:03.868 --> 40:05.402
               Stop what?

40:08.606 --> 40:12.008
   I'll catch you later,
   Reverend Shit-For-Brains.

40:19.383 --> 40:21.151
           (knocking)

40:28.692 --> 40:30.260
        We should talk.

40:51.882 --> 40:53.483
         (loud squeak)

40:55.753 --> 40:58.288
          (screaming)

41:28.319 --> 41:29.352
        (doorknob turns)

41:29.354 --> 41:31.254
Megan, you all right?

41:31.256 --> 41:32.889
               I heard a scream.

41:35.593 --> 41:38.261
                 Baby, you okay?

41:41.699 --> 41:43.533
(gasping)

41:56.013 --> 41:59.449
Megan, hel-- help.

42:01.051 --> 42:03.286
     Help. Help.

42:03.288 --> 42:05.288
       Why?

42:08.626 --> 42:11.027
              No!

42:11.029 --> 42:13.630
          (gasping)

42:22.306 --> 42:24.240
             Megan.

42:24.242 --> 42:26.876
           (gasping)

42:44.028 --> 42:47.163
              <i> ¶ ¶</i>

42:56.440 --> 42:58.608
                    (clattering)

43:01.545 --> 43:04.814
I'm so damn tired
of pushing a rock up a hill.

43:06.917 --> 43:08.585
             I know the feeling.

43:10.521 --> 43:12.455
My way isn't working.

43:12.457 --> 43:14.190
    I accept that.

43:15.859 --> 43:18.661
But if anything,
all I've done is hold you back.

43:19.930 --> 43:21.864
    The truth is...

43:23.934 --> 43:26.002
 I'm jealous of you, Kyle.

43:27.605 --> 43:29.005
             Shouldn't be.

43:31.208 --> 43:33.476
      I don't know what the hell
      I'm doin', Rev.

43:34.445 --> 43:36.879
     You're the one
     with the gift.

43:36.881 --> 43:39.449
                Whatever it is,
                it ain't a gift.

43:40.884 --> 43:43.553
           It's taken the people
           I love from my life.

43:45.389 --> 43:47.323
             Made me hurt people
             I don't even know.

43:47.325 --> 43:50.693
         Little Joshua, Sherry.

43:52.429 --> 43:54.063
      The way they looked at me.

43:55.265 --> 43:57.033
             Like I'm the freak.

44:00.604 --> 44:02.538
            Maybe they're right.

44:03.607 --> 44:05.074
    No, they're not.

44:05.076 --> 44:07.343
        (phone vibrates)

44:12.916 --> 44:15.318
                  Hello?
    AMBER: <i> Dad? Daddy?</i>

44:15.320 --> 44:17.286
       AMBER AND HOLLY:
       (sobbing on phone)

44:17.288 --> 44:18.621
            Amber, what's wrong?

44:18.623 --> 44:20.990
         <i> Aunt Megan.</i>

44:20.992 --> 44:23.793
    <i> She's sick like Mommy!</i>

44:23.795 --> 44:26.663
      (screaming on phone)

44:26.665 --> 44:28.097
                      Amber!

44:28.099 --> 44:29.799
     (screaming continues)

44:29.801 --> 44:30.867
                       Amber!

44:30.869 --> 44:32.368
         (echoing)
        <i> Amber! Amber!</i>

44:32.370 --> 44:33.836
        <i> Amber! Amber!</i>

44:33.838 --> 44:35.338
              <i> Amber! Amber!</i>

44:35.340 --> 44:37.040
                  <i> Amber! Amber!</i>
