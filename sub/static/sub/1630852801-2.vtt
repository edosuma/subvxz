[narrator]<i> previously on</i>
<i> the</i> kings of napa...

00:03.070 --> 00:04.370
<i> Family owns</i>
<i> house of king wines in napa.</i>

00:04.472 --> 00:06.572
-We haven't thought about
dessert wine.
-Lemme think about it.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.907
Why do you always entertain
her erroneous ideas?

00:09.010 --> 00:10.642
-Now go to hell, dana.
-Enough!

00:10.745 --> 00:12.144
[vanessa] honey! My god!

00:12.246 --> 00:13.946
[man]<i> reginald</i>
<i> saw fit that August</i>

00:14.048 --> 00:15.247
-would be president.
-What?

00:15.349 --> 00:17.383
Why would my husband
borrow money from you?

00:17.485 --> 00:19.651
-We had a baby!
-This is crazy.

00:19.754 --> 00:21.954
-We're sisters?
-Did you know
your brother slept with her?

00:22.056 --> 00:23.622
Of course not, vanessa.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.724
-[woman 1] kelvin.
-[woman 2] don't.
He's married.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.826
There's a lot more to this
than you know.

00:27.928 --> 00:30.095
[man] [distorted]<i> I expect</i>
<i> you keep up</i>
<i> with your father's payments.</i>

00:40.708 --> 00:42.141
Forty-eight seconds,
still she's late.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.343
She's allowed to be
on cp time.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.111
You think spike lee's on time
to set every day?

00:46.213 --> 00:47.780
-He's early.
-I know.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.448
I read it in his
<i> do the right thing</i> book.

00:49.550 --> 00:52.451
Good morning.
How's everyone doing?

00:52.553 --> 00:54.987
Waiting for August.
It's like waiting godot,

00:55.089 --> 00:57.322
-but more absurd.
-[christian] you're
doin' okay, mom?

00:57.425 --> 00:59.858
I'm hangin' in there, honey.

00:59.960 --> 01:03.095
Hello, my beautiful
black people!

01:03.197 --> 01:06.765
-Where's August?
-Five, four,

01:06.867 --> 01:10.269
-three--
-hey, everybody.
Sorry, I'm late.

01:11.305 --> 01:12.871
Embracing your
inner easter egg, I see.

01:12.973 --> 01:14.807
-Nice dress.
-Thank you.

01:14.909 --> 01:19.044
-Doin' all right, sis?
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

01:19.146 --> 01:23.649
As you know, I wanna bring
house of kings
into the future.

01:23.751 --> 01:26.285
Help not only boost
our bottom line,

01:26.387 --> 01:29.521
but make this place
one of the premier vineyards
in the world.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.857
I see that we can do it.

01:31.959 --> 01:34.359
But we have to buckle down.
Now if we launch

01:34.462 --> 01:37.496
our dessert wine
in the next six months,
we can achieve this.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.698
And I realize
that's a little fast,

01:39.800 --> 01:41.834
but I'm coming up
with an innovative
marketing plan

01:41.936 --> 01:43.535
that will target millennials

01:43.637 --> 01:46.138
and truly get this family
out of the hole.

01:48.809 --> 01:51.176
August's little
dessert wine fairytale

01:51.278 --> 01:54.213
could decrease
our profit margins by 17%.

01:54.315 --> 01:58.383
Making it harder to release
our pinot grigio
in merlot as planned.

01:58.486 --> 02:01.887
The return on our investment
will more than offset the
losses you're anticipating.

02:01.989 --> 02:04.556
Plus, we can always access
our credit line.

02:04.658 --> 02:07.259
As cfo, I know that
our credit line
is almost maxed up.

02:07.361 --> 02:09.495
We can work it out.

02:09.597 --> 02:12.564
Look, I'm not tryin' to
poo-poo on your parade,

02:12.666 --> 02:15.200
but dana's brilliant
with the company's finances

02:15.302 --> 02:17.002
and predicting
our yearly profits.

02:18.172 --> 02:21.173
Besides, millennials
don't drink wine.

02:21.275 --> 02:24.576
They drink craft ipas
and vape organic weed strains.

02:24.678 --> 02:28.013
-Facts.
-Despite what dana has to say,

02:28.115 --> 02:29.848
we have no time
to lose on this.

02:29.950 --> 02:32.684
I believe it can work,
so it's all-hands-on-deck.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.253
I'm already
in the bottle facility,
sterilizing.

02:34.355 --> 02:35.821
But with bridgette gone,

02:35.923 --> 02:37.756
I also need you to make sure
that grapes
are being harvested correctly.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.124
Harvesting it up, too, baby.

02:39.226 --> 02:42.528
Yvette, I need you
to work your game

02:42.630 --> 02:45.063
and secure us
the distribution deal
that will get the support

02:45.166 --> 02:46.932
in michelin restaurants
around the world.

02:47.034 --> 02:49.935
[laughs] shit. A sister
be travelling.

02:50.037 --> 02:52.804
-I'mma see paris, london...
-[all chuckle]

02:52.907 --> 02:56.408
-...Beijing...
-Rose, I need
a social media pr campaign...

02:56.510 --> 03:00.045
-...The motherland, bora-bora.
-[all laugh]

03:00.147 --> 03:02.581
...That has influencers
around the world

03:02.683 --> 03:04.483
under our influence.

03:04.585 --> 03:07.219
You know, when regie and I
built this place,

03:07.321 --> 03:09.655
we said that people
were going to see

03:09.757 --> 03:11.223
black excellence in motion.

03:11.325 --> 03:15.260
Wine, style, cuisine,
all of it.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.262
-I heard that.
-Mmm.

03:17.364 --> 03:20.766
Look, I know this

03:20.868 --> 03:23.335
recent revelation about dad
has been rough,

03:23.437 --> 03:25.938
but we've got to build
on his legacy.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.974
We must continue
to show the world

03:29.076 --> 03:31.109
that we are kings.

03:31.212 --> 03:33.812
Now, this new wine
could revolutionize us.

03:33.914 --> 03:37.416
It's like dad always said.
"some people
die on the vine,

03:37.518 --> 03:39.518
but we're gonna
thrive on it."

03:43.624 --> 03:44.856
[theme music playing]

04:14.288 --> 04:15.454
-baby?
-Hmm.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.889
-Great job back there.
-You're just sayin' that.

04:17.992 --> 04:20.659
[chuckles] no,
I'm being serious.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.862
-You remind me
of my journalism days.
-[chuckles]

04:23.964 --> 04:26.498
and I'm happy to see
you're still using that cream
that I gave you.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.167
Mom, the cream you gave me
is for hemorrhoids.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.937
-[scoffs]
-I used a concealer,
it gets the job done, too.

04:35.909 --> 04:39.544
-I'm throwing out
your father's things today.
-Mom!

04:39.647 --> 04:42.047
You know you don't
have to move so fast.

04:42.149 --> 04:43.815
You're allowed to mourn,
this is big.

04:43.917 --> 04:46.151
Honey, this land,
these grapes,

04:46.253 --> 04:49.655
the endless bottles of wine,
it is my heaven, August.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.823
But your father's large
omniscient ego stain that,

04:51.925 --> 04:54.059
that in it is something
that I need to remove.

04:54.161 --> 04:57.329
Mom, it's dad.
It's your sister.

04:57.431 --> 04:59.998
It's only been three weeks
since we buried him.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.200
I mean, if you told us
that you wanted to hide out

05:02.303 --> 05:04.269
at canyon ranch
for the rest of the year,
we would get it.

05:04.371 --> 05:08.573
-Don't be ridiculous.
I am fine.
-You're lying.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.709
Maybe you need to unpack this
with dr. Isaacs like I did.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.377
I don't need
a therapist, honey.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.913
What I need is to get through
this gala tonight,

05:15.015 --> 05:17.182
move on
and return to my paradise.

05:17.284 --> 05:20.052
Mom, let me accept
dad's reward. You should rest.

05:20.154 --> 05:23.388
No. You know, I have always
covered for your father

05:23.490 --> 05:25.424
with these
non-profit organizations,
but for once,

05:25.526 --> 05:28.226
I like to be in the spotlight
for something I actually did.

05:28.329 --> 05:29.761
But don't worry though,
I'll go through the back,

05:29.863 --> 05:31.096
say the damn speech
and get out.

05:31.198 --> 05:33.565
Now what are you doing
to pay
my deceitful sister back?

05:33.667 --> 05:35.600
I'm working on something
for her, mom.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.202
Well, work harder, honey.

05:37.304 --> 05:39.404
Focus on it,
like you're a normal
30-something-year old

05:39.506 --> 05:41.807
who needs to find her
prince charming
before it's all too late.

05:41.909 --> 05:44.643
-Like that.
-Too bad kelvin's married,
with a kid.

05:44.745 --> 05:47.145
And represents my sister.

05:47.247 --> 05:49.114
-You know, the black sisters
who wine...
-[women] hey!

05:49.216 --> 05:51.983
...Are here
for their annual tour.

05:52.086 --> 05:53.985
You sure you don't want me
to get someone else to do it?

05:54.088 --> 05:58.657
Nonsense. Honey, that is what
black girl magic is for.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.425
Pretend you're happy
even when you're not.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.462
Besides, I have a dessert wine
to champion.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.397
Hey, ladies.

06:06.266 --> 06:08.567

What if I don't do it?

06:35.596 --> 06:39.631
I don't get it.
We was so close.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.033
-Why isn't vanessa
taking this out on me?
-No idea.

06:42.136 --> 06:43.869
How's your mom doing?

06:43.971 --> 06:47.038
She's pacing all night.

06:47.141 --> 06:50.976
Wants to go over there
and talk to her, but she's
afraid she's gonna get killed.

06:51.078 --> 06:54.246
All this time, I knew
you were my cousin
when we were close,

06:54.348 --> 06:57.015
but now that I found out
you're my sister,
I feel like we lost time.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.418
We didn't.
That's why we're so tight.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.019
We unconsciously knew.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.655
Studying wine together.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.057
Taking all of the same
courses.

07:06.160 --> 07:09.027
-That trip to tuscany.
-[both laugh]

07:10.597 --> 07:13.331
yeah, now we have to
meet up on a sneak tip

07:13.434 --> 07:15.167
like we're
star-crossed lovers.

07:15.269 --> 07:17.536
It's temporary.

07:17.638 --> 07:21.873
Besides, we're gonna
have to, um, figure
something out, because...

07:25.546 --> 07:27.012
We're being extorted.

07:28.115 --> 07:29.548
Wait, what?

07:29.650 --> 07:31.082
Way to bury the lede.

07:31.185 --> 07:33.518
I'm only tellin' you
'cause I don't wanna freak
the family out.

07:33.620 --> 07:37.222
They were shaking down dad,
and now the want $150,000
by tonight.

07:37.324 --> 07:41.092
Wait, hold on-- uncle regie
was being squeezed? By who?

07:41.195 --> 07:41.226
God, who knows?

07:43.130 --> 07:45.397
Our family is crazy.

07:45.499 --> 07:46.932
We've got
an out-of-pocket brother

07:47.034 --> 07:49.100
handling all our company's
finances,

07:49.203 --> 07:53.438
a grandmother in paris
who never made it
to her son-in-law's funeral,

07:53.540 --> 07:56.708
and now we've got some psycho
shaking us down for money.

07:57.878 --> 08:00.879
-Who could be doing this?
-I don't know.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.447
Everyone loved him.

08:02.549 --> 08:05.383
Had you ever seen him
acting odd

08:05.486 --> 08:07.052
or suspicious?

08:07.154 --> 08:10.755
He would sometimes
take calls behind
the production facility,

08:10.858 --> 08:13.291
but I thought
he just needed space.

08:13.393 --> 08:15.360
He was consistent
like an old clock.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.463
Road his bike on saturdays.

08:18.565 --> 08:21.766
Even stuck
to our lobster roll schedule.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.602
Lobster rolls?

08:23.704 --> 08:25.837
He and I would go
to sam shipyard once a month.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.541
Like a...
Like a standing date?

08:30.511 --> 08:33.812
Ah. [scoffs] he never
did that really.

08:33.914 --> 08:36.381
-We only did once in a while.
-It wasn't a date.

08:36.483 --> 08:39.084
It was more so he could
go to the bank.

08:40.053 --> 08:41.953
Wait. [chuckles] back up.

08:42.055 --> 08:45.056
Dad hadn't been inside
of a bank for years,
he had a business manager.

08:45.158 --> 08:47.092
Yeah, and he went
to napa republic, trust me.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.895
It's right across the street
from the restaurant.

08:51.431 --> 08:53.265
-Come on.
-Uh, where are you going?

08:53.367 --> 08:55.400
They're not gonna let you just
break in to his bank account.

08:55.502 --> 08:58.970
Like hell they won't!
I have his death certificate,
come on.

08:59.072 --> 09:02.207
I'm not gonna let anyone mess
with our father's
legacy.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.244
[sighs]

09:18.725 --> 09:21.192
jackpot. Our dad had
a secret account here.

09:21.295 --> 09:25.130
He was making monthly
$150,000-withdrawals

09:25.232 --> 09:27.299
for the last ten months.

09:27.401 --> 09:30.969
-Where is he getting
the money from?
-Probably my mom.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.837
-We should ask her.
-And what if we find out

09:32.940 --> 09:35.206
some more things
about our father
that we can't handle?

09:37.210 --> 09:41.780
Then we'll go through this
like we always have. Together.

09:46.553 --> 09:48.954
Did you know our dad
was being extorted?

09:49.056 --> 09:53.058
-[sighs]
-aunt melanie, now is not
the time to be tight-lipped.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.894
You were tryin' to warn me
outside the restaurant.

09:55.996 --> 09:58.897
Your father was under
a lot of stress, okay?

09:58.999 --> 10:00.665
When he borrowed that money
from me two years ago,

10:00.767 --> 10:02.334
he was paying me back
religiously.

10:02.436 --> 10:04.235
I got a check every month.

10:04.338 --> 10:05.637
But then, this past year,
something happened

10:05.739 --> 10:10.642
and a strange person
started asking him for money.

10:10.744 --> 10:13.378
-Did he ever go to the cops?
-He was too afraid.

10:13.480 --> 10:16.381
Regie didn't know
if it was a syndicate
or organized crime.

10:16.483 --> 10:18.984
All he told me was that
he was under it.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.719
And why did he go to you
and not my mom?

10:20.821 --> 10:23.188
Because he was desperate
not to ruin her image of him.

10:23.290 --> 10:26.324
But he could get it in
with her little sister,
that makes total sense.

10:26.426 --> 10:29.361
And did the caller ever say
what he would do

Continue the payments.

get out of it, he would have.

I should grab a few of them.

You all right, vanessa?

11:56.516 --> 11:58.283
I'm just worried.

12:00.087 --> 12:02.921
You know,
I was not planning this.

12:03.023 --> 12:07.258
I thought
we had another 30 years.
Now, he's dead,

and he took the first 30 years
with him.

12:08.862 --> 12:12.797

No, I cannot deal with her

Sometimes, there's casualties
in war.

Who died and made her king?

13:05.652 --> 13:07.352

Both, more like a wolf version

I suggest we let
the authorities handle this.

was scared whoever this was,
would hurt us.

Have you had a lobotomy?
You went to melanie, too?

15:37.737 --> 15:39.103
What kind of president
are you?

to run all her decisions

than you think, dana.

21:34.027 --> 21:36.494
[r&b music playing]

21:36.596 --> 21:40.164
[dana] it's crazy
that dad's been paying
this guy this whole time.

21:40.266 --> 21:42.867
I just don't get
why dad didn't tell mom
about any of this.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.770
She loved him.
I mean, why only tell
aunt melanie about it.

21:45.872 --> 21:48.139
Gee, I don't know.

21:48.241 --> 21:50.541
Perhaps, their love
wasn't as reciprocal
as we believe.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.443
We were still a family though.

21:52.545 --> 21:55.846
And it could've been
a lot stronger if he just
told us the truth.

21:55.948 --> 21:58.449
[laughs sarcastically]
stronger family.

21:58.551 --> 22:02.320
If dad cheated on mom,
there's no way we can
continue being a family.

22:03.122 --> 22:05.756
Oh, my god. August?

22:06.626 --> 22:08.993
[bridgett] is that
kelvin's wife?

22:09.095 --> 22:11.228
I cannot believe
what I'm seeing right now.

22:11.331 --> 22:14.165
The August king.
And look at you,
you look amazing.

22:14.267 --> 22:16.801
Oh, don't. [chuckles]

22:16.903 --> 22:19.203
oh, my gosh.
Hey, bridgette and dana.

22:19.305 --> 22:20.971
You guys look so great.

22:21.074 --> 22:23.174
Wow. You're all grown-up, too.

22:23.276 --> 22:24.742
[bridgette] hey, sonya.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.477
Uh, you know, sonya?

22:26.579 --> 22:28.679
We're a little busy
right now, so--

22:28.781 --> 22:30.381
all good.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

22:30.483 --> 22:33.017
Just, um... Just you and me,
we'll get together.

22:33.119 --> 22:34.385
Bye!

22:34.487 --> 22:35.886
[bridgette] she's so bitchy.

22:35.988 --> 22:38.089
I can't believe she popped
the kid out of that hot bod.

22:38.191 --> 22:40.057
You're eyeing her body
while we're
going through this?

22:40.159 --> 22:42.593
Whatever! Dad wasn't happy.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.596
He covered it up
by overworking
at the hospital.

22:45.698 --> 22:48.599
Putting on a good face,
talkin' to everyone
around town,

22:48.701 --> 22:50.701
showering us with gifts,

22:50.803 --> 22:53.938
and treating our mom
like a queen
while hiding a double life.

22:54.040 --> 22:57.074
Hell, bridgette came
into the picture,

22:57.176 --> 22:58.776
he had another lie to carry.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.711
Are you saying uncle regie
didn't want me?

23:00.813 --> 23:04.715
No, I'm saying... It's better
to be slapped with the truth

23:04.817 --> 23:07.051
than to be kissed with a lie
by him every night.

23:07.153 --> 23:10.688
But we were kids back then.
I get that part.

23:10.790 --> 23:13.190
No, you don't get it.

23:13.292 --> 23:15.426
We were loyal to him.
I was loyal to him.

23:15.528 --> 23:17.194
And more than anything,

23:17.296 --> 23:19.196
the saddest part
about the lies, all of them,

23:19.298 --> 23:21.899
it's that they didn't come
from an enemy,
they came from our father.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.635
An enemy that
we didn't even know.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.103
A damn traitor.

23:26.205 --> 23:29.940
Dana, you're spiraling,
you're not thinking straight.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.976
If you tell mom,
it will destroy her.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.278
No, I'm thinking
quite clearly.

23:34.380 --> 23:37.281
I don't wanna
keep this a secret.
I've changed my mind.

23:37.383 --> 23:39.717
Screw this. I'm done!

23:39.819 --> 23:41.252
And this family's gonna know
what's going on.

23:41.354 --> 23:42.386
[August] dana,
what are you doing?

23:44.891 --> 23:46.724
He's gonna tell aunt vanessa,
isn't he?

23:54.133 --> 23:57.435

24:02.508 --> 24:06.010
dana, I think you're right.
You should tell your mom
about the extortion.

24:06.112 --> 24:08.479
I know.
I have to figure out when.

24:10.683 --> 24:13.751
Do it now. This will show
you're a leader.

24:13.853 --> 24:17.154
Hey. Where were you all
last night?
I didn't hear you come in.

24:17.256 --> 24:19.824
We stopped at a diner.
The food at the ceremony
was horrible.

24:19.926 --> 24:22.026
Diner? I thought
you hated diners.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.328
Mrs. King, I believe
we should discuss

24:24.430 --> 24:26.263
what actually happened
last night.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.300
What happened last night?

24:29.969 --> 24:32.102
Dana, you wanna tell her?

24:33.773 --> 24:35.139
Just tell her.

24:35.675 --> 24:37.041
Mom...

24:38.845 --> 24:41.545
-Dad was--
-[August] dana, dad
always said, "family first."

24:43.316 --> 24:45.049
what happened last night?

24:46.853 --> 24:50.588
-Dad was--
-...Helping kids in oakland

24:50.690 --> 24:52.256
to pay for college.

24:52.358 --> 24:53.891
-[rose] August...
-What?

24:53.993 --> 24:57.595
-That's why he got all that
money from aunt melanie.
-Mmm-hmm.

24:57.697 --> 25:01.365
He's giving.
He was a giving man.

25:01.467 --> 25:03.033
And why didn't he tell me?

25:03.135 --> 25:05.069
Oh, he probably thought
you'd think

25:05.171 --> 25:06.737
his philanthropic efforts
were blinding him.

25:06.839 --> 25:08.405
Dana, really?

25:09.509 --> 25:11.141
Well, thank you, rose.
I suppose

25:11.244 --> 25:12.977
if she hadn't told me,
I wouldn't have known.

25:13.079 --> 25:14.979
-We were gonna tell you.
-When?

25:15.081 --> 25:17.214
I don't know, mom.
I... I'm sorry.

25:17.316 --> 25:20.284
We just wanted to keep
dad's image as intact for you
as it can be.

25:20.386 --> 25:23.921
No. No more sorries.
No more secrets.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.123
And in case you forgot,
I'm on the board.

25:26.225 --> 25:27.658
And if you can't get this
company back on track

25:27.760 --> 25:29.226
in the next six months,
we'll vote you out.

25:30.663 --> 25:34.431
And we will pick someone
to run this company
who tells me the truth.

25:35.167 --> 25:37.735
-Okay?
-Okay.

25:37.837 --> 25:39.737
Now, take your food to go,
and do your job.

25:39.839 --> 25:42.439
-[scoffs]
-yeah. And you, too, dana,

25:42.542 --> 25:44.208
this company's
gotta stay afloat.

[sighs]

26:24.317 --> 26:25.316
[sighs]

26:40.466 --> 26:42.666
question, kelvin,

26:42.768 --> 26:46.704
what are the legalities
of someone blackmailing you
for a ransom?

26:46.806 --> 26:48.238
Oh, that's extortion, August.

26:48.341 --> 26:50.474
It's a federal crime.
Is there something going on?

26:50.576 --> 26:53.344
No. No, I'm just...
I'm just thinking out loud.

26:54.180 --> 26:55.646
Are you sure?
You can talk to me.

26:55.748 --> 26:58.582
I've known you
since high school.
I know when something's up.

27:01.454 --> 27:03.320
You know, I'm good. I'm good.

27:03.422 --> 27:05.422
Let's just
focus on why I came.

27:05.524 --> 27:07.825
Where are we
with the melanie thing?

27:07.927 --> 27:10.928
Well, oddly, I just got a call
from her this morning.

27:11.030 --> 27:13.764
She wants to revise
the agreement
she previously offered.

27:13.866 --> 27:15.899
Said she's concerned
about a situation

27:16.002 --> 27:17.768
you, bridgette,
and the family are in,

27:17.870 --> 27:20.871
and wanted to make sure
paying her back
wasn't too much of a burden.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.673
Are you kiddin' me?

27:22.775 --> 27:24.375
Just start paying her back
according to plan,

27:24.477 --> 27:25.743
and she'll take it
on good faith

27:25.845 --> 27:28.112
that you'll give bridgette
her job back
as soon as possible.

27:28.214 --> 27:31.048
-Yes, of course.
-All you have to do
is sign this.

27:38.057 --> 27:39.790
-There you go.
-Thank you.

27:41.027 --> 27:42.226
[sighs]

27:44.664 --> 27:47.865
so... That's it?

27:47.967 --> 27:49.400
Yeah.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.536
Now...

27:54.707 --> 27:56.807
When can I start seeing
the other August?

28:00.079 --> 28:01.445
Wow.

28:01.547 --> 28:03.147
Wow!

28:03.249 --> 28:06.150
You really are just like
every other married brother

28:06.252 --> 28:09.820
tryin' to step to
some single girl
to get your swag back.

28:09.922 --> 28:13.223
It is not my fault
that you decided
to jump the broom

28:13.325 --> 28:15.559
with some woman you clearly
don't love,

28:15.661 --> 28:17.461
or even like.

28:17.563 --> 28:18.796
I mean,
what were you expecting?

28:18.898 --> 28:20.631
We'd grab a couple of drinks,
and hook-up doggy style

28:20.733 --> 28:22.332
at the hotel like we did
after the prom?

28:23.369 --> 28:26.670
No, no, no.
I can't go out like that.

28:26.772 --> 28:30.274
I will not
be someone's leftovers

28:30.376 --> 28:32.109
while your wife,
who I saw last night,

28:32.211 --> 28:34.278
by the way,
gets the main course.

28:34.380 --> 28:37.748
I am
the whole damn restaurant.

28:37.850 --> 28:40.117
-Are you finished?
-Oh, you have
something to say?

28:40.886 --> 28:42.286
I'm separated, August.

28:44.557 --> 28:46.590
And I ain't never
lost my swag.

28:48.694 --> 28:52.129
[chuckles] but your
wedding ring.

28:52.231 --> 28:55.265
You know, maybe I should've
put my stuff on instagram,

28:55.367 --> 28:58.969
so the whole world could see
my marriage fall apart,
but the truth is...

28:59.071 --> 29:01.171
I didn't feel like dating,
so I left it on.

29:01.273 --> 29:04.308
Uh... Why didn't you tell me?

29:06.112 --> 29:07.845
I was just tryin'
to suss you out.

29:07.947 --> 29:10.814
I didn't know if you were
with somebody, and, uh--

29:10.916 --> 29:12.716
are you single?

29:14.320 --> 29:16.787
Oh... [laughs] um...

29:16.889 --> 29:18.989
Is that a yes?

29:19.091 --> 29:20.724
No?

29:20.826 --> 29:23.927
[laughs] you would like
to know, wouldn't you?

29:26.732 --> 29:29.299
Bridgette, what up, girl?
I mean...

29:29.401 --> 29:30.667
How did you even
get past security?

29:30.770 --> 29:32.236
I need to see August.
It's important.

29:32.338 --> 29:33.837
Yo, homegirl bounced,
but in the meantime,

29:33.939 --> 29:36.874
can you tell me why otis
always acts like he got
something stuck up his ass?

29:36.976 --> 29:38.909
I don't have time to play
vineyard tutor
with you right now.

29:39.011 --> 29:40.544
Just get some cliff notes.

29:40.646 --> 29:42.980
What? They have cliff notes
on wine making?

29:45.184 --> 29:46.183
What's going on?

29:49.021 --> 29:50.454
I need to talk to you.

29:51.257 --> 29:52.189
Privately.

29:56.629 --> 29:59.596
-This is about the family?
-I found something.

30:06.105 --> 30:07.404
It's really delicate.

30:07.506 --> 30:10.240
Especially, with
all the secrets we're hiding
from aunt vanessa.

30:10.342 --> 30:13.177
But that means
you really have to help me
get my job back.

30:13.279 --> 30:14.778
You know, I'm your only ally
in this house.

30:14.880 --> 30:17.614
I'm going to help you
get your job back.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.450
It's deeper
than we could've imagined.

30:21.987 --> 30:23.387
And I'm sorry.

30:30.663 --> 30:31.929
[August] what is this?

30:32.031 --> 30:34.231
My dad wrote aunt melanie
love letters?

30:35.801 --> 30:38.535
And she's sending mixtapes.

30:38.637 --> 30:40.270
Oh, my god.

30:40.372 --> 30:42.539
-If my mom found this,
she would--
-[vanessa] show it to me.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.245
Give it to me, now.

30:55.221 --> 30:57.054
"dear melanie...

30:57.156 --> 31:01.158
I know it's...
Been a long time,

31:01.260 --> 31:05.162
but I've been thinking
about you and us.

31:05.865 --> 31:08.098
And the last time we--"

31:13.072 --> 31:14.238
[door opens]

31:14.340 --> 31:16.273
mom? The lovely sisters
who're wining

31:16.375 --> 31:17.841
came all the way
from baltimore

31:17.943 --> 31:19.509
and have been waiting for you
in the tasting room.

31:19.612 --> 31:21.144
-We need to--
-yeah, uh, um...

31:21.247 --> 31:22.312
Dana, I'll handle it.

31:22.414 --> 31:24.648
You've done enough,
don't you think?

31:24.750 --> 31:27.017
-Aunt v--
-and this...

31:27.119 --> 31:28.952
This is how you repay me?

31:29.054 --> 31:31.288
Mom, she was just
tryin' to help.

31:32.291 --> 31:35.058
Mom. Mom? What are you doing?

31:36.595 --> 31:38.462
[August] mom. Mom!

31:38.564 --> 31:40.864
[women laughing]

31:41.867 --> 31:43.867
[women speaking indistinctly]

31:48.707 --> 31:51.541
ladies, please accept
my sincere apologies.

31:51.644 --> 31:54.444
But I have
some cardinal advice
to get off my chest.

31:54.546 --> 31:57.547
"don't you ever give up
your dreams for a man."

31:57.650 --> 32:01.151
see, I was a journalist
who could've been
barbara walters by now.

32:01.253 --> 32:05.222
I was gonna write books,
win a pulitzer, but no!

32:05.324 --> 32:08.792
I traded it all in to have
a family with a brother

32:08.894 --> 32:11.161
who not only
stepped out on me,

32:11.263 --> 32:13.997
but he put his single-minded
no-good crusty package

32:14.099 --> 32:15.832
-into my sister.
-[women gasp]

32:15.935 --> 32:17.801
oh, you heard me.

32:17.903 --> 32:19.636
My sister.

32:19.738 --> 32:21.838
My ride-or-die bestie

32:21.941 --> 32:24.741
-sat on my husband's big dick!
-[women exclaim]

32:24.843 --> 32:27.811
-mom, mom!
-[woman] damn! She's
spilling all the tea!

32:27.913 --> 32:30.514
And then ran over my heart
with an amazon truck...

32:30.616 --> 32:32.582
Full of jeff bezos' money.

32:33.285 --> 32:36.987
With that, this is the end
of my tour.

32:37.089 --> 32:40.257
And I wish you all
a safe travels
back to baltimore.

32:40.359 --> 32:41.858
And we'll see you next year.

32:41.961 --> 32:46.263
And remember
the house of kings
is about black excellence

32:46.365 --> 32:48.932
-and infidelity.
-[gasps]

We'll see you next time.

33:15.961 --> 33:18.362

Did he love her more than me?

33:18.464 --> 33:19.997

Mom, stop.
You're eating too much.

33:36.482 --> 33:38.949
Well, are you shaming me
during my grief?

33:39.051 --> 33:41.618
-They were on my bed, honey.
-I'll make you a fruit salad.

his recipe.

goes down on your husband,

Trust me, give it to me!
-No!

No. Trust me.

33:53.232 --> 33:55.966
the caller was in here.
We've gotta amp up
our security.

33:56.068 --> 33:58.402
-I'll make some calls.
-They're crazy.

33:58.504 --> 34:00.604
And we'll have to
work together on this.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.372
And what about bridgette?

34:02.474 --> 34:04.374
She wasn't here tryin'
to make things worse, dana.

34:04.476 --> 34:06.576
She was tryin'
to prove her loyalty.

34:06.678 --> 34:07.811
-She did more damage.

34:07.913 --> 34:10.580

she's family!

34:10.682 --> 34:15.218
August, I know you want
to bring bridgette back.

34:15.320 --> 34:16.586
But if she walks back
in this house,

34:16.688 --> 34:18.422
mom will kill her
and then herself.

34:18.524 --> 34:21.091

You haven't rewarded them

Please don't tell me
you showed them
to the kings.

-Because they're my family!

They're gonna take care of me,
they're gonna bring me back.

And when they do,
I'm gonna make sure
they leave you high and dry

if I could come back?

I couldn't,

supposed to be best friends,

have to trust me.

This is my life, August.

my mom will have
a breakdown.
