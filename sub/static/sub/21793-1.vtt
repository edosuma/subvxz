01:51.829 --> 01:53.880
So, 1600 a month?

01:53.881 --> 01:56.192
- Yep, that's what it is.

01:56.193 --> 01:57.212
- Well, I want to rent
the apartment, not the

01:57.213 --> 01:58.296
whole block.

01:59.209 --> 02:01.860
- It has got everything
you could possibly need.

02:01.861 --> 02:03.796
I mean it's close to the shops,

02:03.797 --> 02:05.760
the tube station is right down the road,

02:05.761 --> 02:07.848
it has got some great pubs on the corner

02:07.849 --> 02:09.752
and it's furnished.

02:09.752 --> 02:11.716
- Yeah, I know.

02:11.717 --> 02:12.948
- So you'll take it right?

02:12.949 --> 02:13.949
- Uh, well.

02:15.599 --> 02:17.896
- You're an actress, aren't you?

02:17.897 --> 02:18.730
- Yeah.

02:18.731 --> 02:22.472
- Yeah, yeah, I saw you in the silent

02:22.473 --> 02:23.306
- Day.

02:23.307 --> 02:24.723
- The Silent Day.

02:25.565 --> 02:27.815
Yeah, you were really good.

02:30.423 --> 02:33.092
- Okay, well I don't want to push you,

02:33.093 --> 02:34.384
but this place is going to be rented

02:34.385 --> 02:35.660
by the end of the day.

02:35.661 --> 02:36.708
- Really?

02:36.709 --> 02:38.224
- Yeah, I mean, these types

02:38.225 --> 02:41.310
of apartments are almost
impossible to find.

02:41.311 --> 02:42.992
I've got like 10 people coming by

02:42.993 --> 02:44.896
to visit this place just today.

02:44.897 --> 02:45.730
- 10?

02:45.730 --> 02:46.563
- Yeah.

02:46.564 --> 02:47.646
- Yeah right.

02:52.727 --> 02:56.560
- Jonathan, hi, please
tell me I got the job.

02:58.053 --> 02:59.053
Oh fuck.

03:01.205 --> 03:03.122
Did they get my script?

03:04.969 --> 03:06.386
Did they like it?

03:07.445 --> 03:08.505
What?

03:08.506 --> 03:09.923
Not enough drama?

03:13.385 --> 03:14.612
My script is so much better than all

03:14.613 --> 03:16.363
this Hollywood crap.

03:18.289 --> 03:20.539
Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry too.

03:21.753 --> 03:24.304
Okay, speak to you tomorrow.

03:24.305 --> 03:25.305
Bye.

03:27.153 --> 03:28.153
Fuck.

03:39.331 --> 03:40.414
I'll take it.

04:08.591 --> 04:09.525
- Morning Sandra.

04:09.526 --> 04:10.884
- Good morning Dick,

04:10.885 --> 04:11.748
I hope you don't mind

04:11.749 --> 04:13.428
but we've all started working already.

04:13.429 --> 04:15.662
- No, I don't mind.

04:15.663 --> 04:17.411
- Oh, it's really good to see you anyway.

04:17.413 --> 04:18.517
- Yeah, you too.

04:18.519 --> 04:19.878
And you know I'm wishing you double

04:19.879 --> 04:21.320
what you're wishing me.

04:21.321 --> 04:23.085
- I can't go to hell twice, Dick.

04:23.086 --> 04:27.253
- Yeah, but two Sandra's
wouldn't fit anyway, would they?

04:31.231 --> 04:32.314
Morning mate.

04:34.852 --> 04:37.925
- I just sold them an Audi Q5.

04:37.926 --> 04:39.926
That's number 87 so far.

04:44.283 --> 04:45.337
What?

04:45.338 --> 04:48.505
You're not happy for your best friend?

04:49.483 --> 04:52.084
Are you feeling depressed?

04:52.085 --> 04:54.079
- No, I'm reading this book,

04:54.080 --> 04:55.574
it's fascinating.

04:55.575 --> 04:56.934
- Selling cars for dummies?

04:56.935 --> 04:58.516
- Don't be a Dick Sandra.

04:58.517 --> 05:00.500
It's about ancient wisdom.

05:00.501 --> 05:01.966
- Ah.

05:01.967 --> 05:03.548
- Oh, nice.

05:03.549 --> 05:05.584
- Did you know that when you buy a car,

05:05.585 --> 05:07.335
you feel happy right?

05:08.219 --> 05:09.969
But it isn't according to this,

05:09.970 --> 05:11.876
the car that causes the happiness.

05:11.877 --> 05:14.237
The happiness is created by the fact that

05:14.238 --> 05:18.248
in that moment you are free from desire.

05:18.249 --> 05:22.166
And so for a moment life
is as good as it gets.

05:23.894 --> 05:26.088
- Listen, happiness is the absence

05:26.089 --> 05:27.895
of striving for happiness.

05:27.896 --> 05:28.934
Chuang Tzu.

05:28.935 --> 05:30.072
- Yeah.

05:30.073 --> 05:32.022
- Mate, do you never
think about this stuff?

05:32.023 --> 05:33.404
Like what it's all about?

05:33.405 --> 05:34.257
Because you know what.

05:34.258 --> 05:35.580
I was reading this last night

05:35.581 --> 05:37.656
and do you know what I realized?

05:37.657 --> 05:39.162
- You're having a midlife crisis?

05:39.163 --> 05:41.446
- I realized who I was.

05:41.447 --> 05:44.697
- Come on Dick, our meeting's starting.

05:53.229 --> 05:55.229
- Right guys, listen up.

05:56.203 --> 05:58.514
First of all the results so far.

05:58.515 --> 05:59.515
Leo, 86.

06:00.419 --> 06:02.502
- I just sold an Audi Q5.

06:03.393 --> 06:05.060
- My correction, 87.

06:06.226 --> 06:08.596
Philip, 79, above expectation.

06:08.597 --> 06:09.597
Arno, 71.

06:12.010 --> 06:13.093
And Dick, 29.

06:17.450 --> 06:21.380
You sold just 1 car over
the last two weeks Dick.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.048
Success is a choice.

06:24.291 --> 06:26.874
It all depends on one question.

06:27.741 --> 06:30.457
Are you an eagle or a Duck?

06:30.458 --> 06:31.974
- I'm sorry?

06:31.975 --> 06:34.808
- Are you an eagle or a Duck Dick?

06:35.987 --> 06:38.602
I want only eagles on my team.

06:38.603 --> 06:41.270
Ducks they just swim and waddle.

06:42.220 --> 06:43.803
Now an eagle flies,

06:46.609 --> 06:48.425
has a great overview

06:48.426 --> 06:51.176
and knows precisely when to swoop

06:52.321 --> 06:53.738
and get its prey.

06:55.807 --> 06:58.224
- Yeah, but I'm a vegetarian.

07:03.032 --> 07:05.462
- You have one more
month to prove yourself,

07:05.463 --> 07:07.213
otherwise you're out.

07:08.890 --> 07:09.899
Moving on gentlemen.

07:09.900 --> 07:10.900
Next item.

07:16.307 --> 07:17.362
- Hi sweet.

07:17.363 --> 07:18.363
- Hi.

07:19.199 --> 07:20.913
- How was the audition?

07:20.914 --> 07:23.568
- Yeah, they seemed to like it.

07:23.569 --> 07:24.973
I think it went well.

07:24.974 --> 07:25.974
- Great!

07:27.323 --> 07:28.786
Where's Anna?

07:28.787 --> 07:29.787
- What?

07:30.895 --> 07:32.916
I thought you were picking her up.

07:32.917 --> 07:34.430
You knew I had an audition.

07:34.431 --> 07:35.279
- You said

07:35.280 --> 07:36.928
- No, no, you relax, stay here,

07:36.929 --> 07:37.781
don't worry about it,

07:37.782 --> 07:39.448
I'll go and get her.

07:41.278 --> 07:42.445
- Take my car!

07:43.711 --> 07:45.878
- Oh, thank you very much.

08:06.273 --> 08:07.121
Anna!

08:07.122 --> 08:08.157
- Mum!

08:08.158 --> 08:10.928
- You cannot just walk home on your own.

08:10.929 --> 08:12.338
- You didn't pick me up.

08:12.339 --> 08:13.683
- I'm sorry.

08:13.684 --> 08:15.620
Come on, come with me.

08:15.621 --> 08:16.954
Are you alright?

08:19.955 --> 08:20.857
- Can I have a sweetie?

08:20.857 --> 08:21.857
- Yep.

08:23.459 --> 08:25.959
So how was your day at school?

08:27.357 --> 08:29.324
- We had sports day.

08:29.325 --> 08:30.262
- What?

08:30.263 --> 08:33.340
- You forgot to bring my sports clothes.

08:33.341 --> 08:34.506
- I didn't know Anna.

08:34.508 --> 08:36.140
They should have told me.

08:36.142 --> 08:38.975
- It was in the letter I gave you.

08:42.376 --> 08:43.744
Who's Lucile?

08:43.745 --> 08:44.745
- What?

08:51.442 --> 08:54.828
It's one of your father's
colleagues darling.

08:54.829 --> 08:57.996
She must really like working with him.

09:10.909 --> 09:11.909
- Hi dad.

09:14.900 --> 09:16.688
- I'm sorry sweet.

09:16.689 --> 09:19.240
I thought your mum was
coming to pick you up.

09:19.241 --> 09:20.884
- It's okay.

09:20.885 --> 09:21.825
- Anna, why don't you go

09:21.826 --> 09:23.020
and watch the television?

09:23.021 --> 09:23.854
- Alright.

09:23.854 --> 09:24.854
- Good girl.

09:26.781 --> 09:28.584
- Give me your phone.

09:28.585 --> 09:30.111
- What?

09:30.112 --> 09:31.862
- Give me your phone.

09:34.433 --> 09:37.914
- My phone's none of your business.

09:37.915 --> 09:41.706
- Why, is it only Lucille's business?

09:41.707 --> 09:42.946
- We're work colleagues.

09:42.947 --> 09:44.020
- Mum, may I have a drink?

09:44.021 --> 09:46.414
- Yeah, in a minute Anna.

09:46.415 --> 09:48.150
- We're work colleagues, it's nothing.

09:48.151 --> 09:49.782
Nothing.

09:49.783 --> 09:51.296
- How long has this been going on?

09:51.297 --> 09:52.484
- Nothing is going on.

09:52.485 --> 09:53.486
- Do you think I'm an idiot?

09:53.487 --> 09:54.339
- No.

09:54.340 --> 09:55.866
- Did you have sex with her?

09:55.867 --> 09:57.140
- No.

09:57.141 --> 09:58.328
- Mum.

09:58.329 --> 10:01.130
- Yeah, in a second Anna.

10:01.131 --> 10:03.964
- You can sleep on the couch mate.

10:38.626 --> 10:39.910
- Anna?

10:39.911 --> 10:41.324
You're still awake?

10:41.325 --> 10:42.686
- Yes.

10:42.687 --> 10:43.687
- Yeah okay.

10:48.812 --> 10:49.990
I've got to talk to you.

10:49.991 --> 10:50.991
Okay?

10:59.612 --> 11:02.512
- Why are you angry with dad?

11:02.513 --> 11:04.596
- Let's put it this way,

11:08.092 --> 11:11.509
Mummy had baked daddy a really tasty cake

11:15.393 --> 11:19.148
and she was waiting for him to get home

11:19.149 --> 11:20.899
to give him the cake.

11:21.969 --> 11:25.469
And when he finally arrived he was full up

11:28.549 --> 11:32.716
because he had already
eaten another woman's cake.

11:33.952 --> 11:38.119
That's why mummy has to
go on holiday for a while.

11:43.132 --> 11:44.592
- To Spain?

11:44.593 --> 11:45.593
- London.

11:48.833 --> 11:53.324
But you can come and visit
me whenever you like okay?

11:53.325 --> 11:54.325
If you want.

12:22.769 --> 12:26.186
- Are you looking for UFO's or something?

12:46.311 --> 12:47.311
- Oh hello.

13:00.551 --> 13:02.970
Good morning Sandra.

13:02.971 --> 13:04.731
You look beautiful today.

13:04.732 --> 13:05.732
- What?

13:10.993 --> 13:12.768
- Morning Leo.

13:12.769 --> 13:14.192
- And he is late again.

13:14.193 --> 13:16.610
That's a record even for you.

13:19.111 --> 13:21.587
- Oh, it's happening.

13:21.588 --> 13:22.651
- What?

13:22.652 --> 13:23.652
- All this.

13:24.652 --> 13:26.150
Isn't it wonderful?

13:26.151 --> 13:27.968
- Are you feeling alright Dick?

13:27.969 --> 13:29.472
- Hey Leo,

13:29.473 --> 13:31.790
has anyone ever told you,

13:31.791 --> 13:33.541
that you are perfect?

13:34.833 --> 13:35.833
- What?

13:39.249 --> 13:40.749
- You are perfect.

13:41.932 --> 13:43.128
- Are you on drugs Dick?

13:43.129 --> 13:44.369
- You know I love you.

13:44.370 --> 13:46.112
- Get off, get off.

13:46.113 --> 13:47.888
Are you crazy?

13:47.889 --> 13:48.972
- Mr. Hanson.

13:50.529 --> 13:51.531
I have come to tell you I am taking

13:51.532 --> 13:52.532
the day off.

13:53.372 --> 13:54.369
- Dick, you know that there's

13:54.370 --> 13:55.888
a procedure for these things.

13:55.889 --> 13:59.691
- It is far too nice out there for work.

13:59.692 --> 14:00.689
- Mr. Hanson,

14:00.690 --> 14:03.211
he's feeling a bit confused.

14:03.212 --> 14:06.811
- He's reading this book
on spirituality and so

14:06.812 --> 14:09.110
- Dick, I don't care
if in your private time

14:09.111 --> 14:10.987
you listen to vegetarian music.

14:10.988 --> 14:12.790
But here we work.

14:12.791 --> 14:14.608
I suggest you focus on your targets.

14:14.609 --> 14:16.651
- And then what?

14:16.652 --> 14:17.990
We focus on our targets

14:17.991 --> 14:19.910
and we make our goals and then next year

14:19.911 --> 14:24.349
we make new goals and
then we all panic again.

14:24.350 --> 14:25.712
Does no one else see that that

14:25.713 --> 14:28.130
is just completely pointless?

14:31.073 --> 14:32.656
- You are so fired.

14:36.129 --> 14:37.796
- Oh, thank you sir.

14:41.208 --> 14:43.208
- Get out, you imbecile.

14:48.252 --> 14:49.667
- Do you know what your
gravestone is going

14:49.668 --> 14:51.931
to say when you die?

14:51.932 --> 14:53.051
It's gonna say,

14:53.052 --> 14:56.219
here lies John, he sold a lot of cars?

15:00.156 --> 15:02.073
Who's the imbecile now?

15:14.433 --> 15:16.233
- Oh, that one over there.

15:16.234 --> 15:17.234
Thanks.

15:19.233 --> 15:21.696
- It's so nice having
you living next to me.

15:21.697 --> 15:24.635
A close neighbor is better
than a far-away friend.

15:24.636 --> 15:25.791
- Sure.

15:25.792 --> 15:27.312
- So, that's so exciting that your mum's

15:27.313 --> 15:28.670
going to be living here.

15:28.671 --> 15:31.094
- It's just a holiday.

15:31.095 --> 15:32.428
- Oh, I thought.

15:36.611 --> 15:37.610
- My mum and dad are on holiday

15:37.611 --> 15:39.094
as well at the moment.

15:39.095 --> 15:41.413
They are on a cruise around Scandinavia.

15:41.414 --> 15:43.712
So I have the whole apartment to myself.

15:43.713 --> 15:45.915
- You still live with your mum and dad?

15:45.916 --> 15:47.094
- Yep, do you know how expensive it is

15:47.095 --> 15:48.614
to rent in London at the moment?

15:48.615 --> 15:49.615
- No.

15:51.692 --> 15:53.611
- Don't you have a job?

15:53.612 --> 15:58.112
- Yes, I'm a computer programmer
in PHP, C++, javascript,

15:58.113 --> 16:01.696
HANA technology and
mobile cloud solutions.

16:04.375 --> 16:05.625
- This is Lisa.

16:09.356 --> 16:10.832
- Any more to bring in?

16:10.833 --> 16:12.233
- No, that's great.

16:12.234 --> 16:13.312
- If you need any more help,

16:13.313 --> 16:15.191
feel free to ask me.

16:15.192 --> 16:16.192
- Great.

16:16.192 --> 16:17.192
Bye.

16:18.417 --> 16:19.415
- Bye, Anna.

16:19.416 --> 16:20.811
- Bye.

16:20.812 --> 16:21.814
- Martin.

16:21.815 --> 16:22.950
- Bye, Martin.

16:22.951 --> 16:23.951
- Bye.

16:48.694 --> 16:50.777
- Mum, it's Martin again.

16:56.292 --> 16:57.813
- I was thinking.

16:57.814 --> 16:59.376
Could I take you for a drink

16:59.377 --> 17:01.534
somewhere this week?

17:01.535 --> 17:03.476
- I've just moved in so.

17:03.477 --> 17:06.470
- Just to get to know
each other as neighbors?

17:06.471 --> 17:07.721
Just one drink?

17:09.297 --> 17:10.294
- Yes.

17:10.295 --> 17:12.016
- Great, tomorrow?

17:12.017 --> 17:14.117
- Perhaps a little later in the week?

17:14.117 --> 17:15.117
Thursday?

17:16.054 --> 17:17.115
- Perfect.

17:17.116 --> 17:18.117
We can go to the Red Lion

17:18.117 --> 17:19.133
at the end of the street.

17:19.134 --> 17:20.131
- Sure.

17:20.132 --> 17:21.376
- Say at seven PM?

17:21.377 --> 17:22.693
- Eight.

17:22.694 --> 17:24.611
- Perfect, great, nice.

17:25.617 --> 17:26.617
- Okay.

17:27.396 --> 17:28.816
Well bye.

17:28.817 --> 17:31.936
- Yeah okay, yeah, bye then.

17:31.937 --> 17:32.937
- Bye.

18:01.916 --> 18:03.973
- Wow, thank you.

18:03.974 --> 18:06.453
That is such a great farewell party.

18:06.454 --> 18:07.287
- Well you know,

18:07.288 --> 18:08.574
we're really gonna miss you Dick.

18:08.575 --> 18:10.949
It's like who's going to
insult me in the morning?

18:10.950 --> 18:12.873
- Don't worry, I'll text you.

18:12.874 --> 18:13.874
- Oh joy.

18:14.575 --> 18:17.492
- Can I have a cola, please?

18:17.493 --> 18:18.633
- A glass of white wine.

18:18.634 --> 18:20.134
- Sparkling water.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.014
- You know what?

18:24.015 --> 18:27.294
It's absolutely wonderful to be free.

18:27.295 --> 18:29.934
And you know what I've realized what I am?

18:29.935 --> 18:30.935
- A dick?

18:32.496 --> 18:34.153
- No, listen.

18:34.154 --> 18:35.154
Who are you?

18:36.997 --> 18:37.997
- Leo.

18:38.842 --> 18:40.629
- Yeah okay so you're Leo.

18:40.630 --> 18:43.875
But let's say you change
your name to Roger.

18:43.876 --> 18:45.556
Are you still Leo?

18:45.557 --> 18:48.974
- Why would Leo change his name to Roger?

18:50.031 --> 18:52.405
- Well okay, you know what?

18:52.406 --> 18:53.593
That's beside the point.

18:53.594 --> 18:54.612
What I'm trying to explain

18:54.613 --> 18:56.574
is that you are not your name.

18:56.575 --> 18:57.796
This is probably the most important

18:57.797 --> 18:59.732
question you're ever
going to ask yourself.

18:59.733 --> 19:00.733
Who are you?

19:02.997 --> 19:03.997
- Cheers.

19:05.637 --> 19:07.636
- Because I think you
think you're your body.

19:07.637 --> 19:09.454
But you are not your body.

19:09.455 --> 19:11.612
- My scales will beg to differ.

19:11.613 --> 19:15.363
- Okay, but what if I
cut off both your arms

19:16.470 --> 19:19.314
and both your legs, are you still you?

19:19.315 --> 19:20.334
- I really don't think that's

19:20.335 --> 19:22.052
the best way to lose weight, Dick.

19:22.053 --> 19:23.453
- If you haven't got any arms and legs,

19:23.454 --> 19:25.054
are you still you.

19:25.055 --> 19:26.414
- Yes, of course you are.

19:26.415 --> 19:28.532
- So where then is the hidden I am,

19:28.533 --> 19:29.636
this little I.

19:29.637 --> 19:30.974
In your body?

19:30.975 --> 19:33.732
I know what you're want to say now.

19:33.733 --> 19:35.076
You want to say,

19:35.077 --> 19:36.633
actually it's in my mind.

19:36.634 --> 19:38.153
You think there is a little Sandra

19:38.154 --> 19:40.254
up in your mind steering the wheel.

19:40.255 --> 19:44.612
But that, that little
I, that's an illusion.

19:44.613 --> 19:45.913
- Whatever.

19:45.914 --> 19:46.914
- No Sandra.

19:48.117 --> 19:51.876
Listen, if you look for that I you're

19:51.877 --> 19:54.309
never going to find it.

19:54.310 --> 19:57.593
- Oh, so The I is like
a girlfriend for Leo.

19:57.594 --> 19:58.671
- What?

19:58.672 --> 19:59.774
- You'll never find one.

19:59.775 --> 20:00.773
- Oh come on.

20:00.774 --> 20:02.212
Just because I haven't had a date in

20:02.213 --> 20:03.972
a while doesn't mean I
can't get laid anymore.

20:03.973 --> 20:04.974
- Of course it doesn't.

20:04.975 --> 20:06.532
It just means you have to pay for it.

20:06.533 --> 20:07.773
- I have sex from time to time.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.614
I just don't always
tell you guys about it.

20:09.615 --> 20:11.652
- What a minute.

20:11.653 --> 20:15.812
This is possibly the most
existential question ever here,

20:15.813 --> 20:17.391
and you've just turned it to sex.

20:17.392 --> 20:18.532
- Everything is about sex.

20:18.533 --> 20:20.254
Life is about sex.

20:20.255 --> 20:23.832
We're only here because
somebody has been fucking.

20:23.833 --> 20:25.731
Well apart from Leo obviously.

20:25.732 --> 20:27.009
- And how many have you had Sandra?

20:27.010 --> 20:28.772
- What, today?

20:28.773 --> 20:31.412
- No, you guys, you don't understand it.

20:31.413 --> 20:34.355
Our brains, they are creating

20:34.356 --> 20:36.607
this self-awareness all the time

20:36.608 --> 20:38.608
and then you think that.

20:47.435 --> 20:50.616
- My goal in life is
connect with the source,

20:50.617 --> 20:53.034
to be one with infinite love.

20:56.412 --> 20:57.995
- Thank you, Alice.

21:03.396 --> 21:05.612
- I could do it a bit more
aggressively if you like.

21:05.613 --> 21:06.809
- No, no, no, it was good.

21:06.810 --> 21:09.155
- Yes, thank you Alice.

21:09.156 --> 21:09.989
- It was great to see
you and solid audition.

21:09.990 --> 21:12.069
What's your availability at the moment?

21:12.070 --> 21:13.315
- You know what it's like,

21:13.316 --> 21:15.129
I've got a lot of jobs on the go.

21:15.130 --> 21:17.313
- Oh, we're filming in the next few days

21:17.314 --> 21:18.653
and if you're busy then.

21:18.654 --> 21:21.256
- No, no, no, I'm sure I can fit it in.

21:21.257 --> 21:23.395
I can be pretty flexible.

21:23.396 --> 21:25.029
- Good, we'll give you a call.

21:25.030 --> 21:26.472
- Thanks, Tom.

21:26.473 --> 21:27.555
It's good to see you.

21:27.556 --> 21:29.592
We should catch up.

21:29.593 --> 21:31.843
- I'll walk with you Alice.

21:34.758 --> 21:36.045
- Bridget.

21:36.046 --> 21:36.879
- Hi, Ismael.

21:36.879 --> 21:37.802
- Nice seeing you.

21:37.802 --> 21:38.635
- How are you?

21:38.636 --> 21:39.968
- Good, come in.

21:51.798 --> 21:52.845
- Oh, Alice.

21:52.846 --> 21:53.679
- Hi.

21:53.680 --> 21:54.813
- Sorry I'm late,

21:54.814 --> 21:57.301
I had to go to an audition.

21:57.302 --> 21:58.517
- Oh, you're an actress?

21:58.518 --> 21:59.971
- Yeah.

21:59.972 --> 22:01.185
- Oh shit.

22:01.186 --> 22:04.335
Have I seen you in anything?

22:04.336 --> 22:07.169
- You remember Elements of Spring?

22:08.205 --> 22:09.538
- No, no, sorry.

22:11.057 --> 22:13.965
- Well, next week I might be winning

22:13.966 --> 22:16.245
the award for best actress

22:16.246 --> 22:18.079
in the The Silent Day.

22:22.070 --> 22:24.201
- Nothing To Be Lost?

22:24.202 --> 22:25.401
- The one with the bear.

22:25.402 --> 22:26.314
- Vampires.

22:26.315 --> 22:27.741
- Vampires, bear.

22:27.742 --> 22:29.569
- Do you ever go to the cinema?

22:29.570 --> 22:32.285
- I am terrible with names.

22:32.286 --> 22:33.829
- No One Left?

22:33.830 --> 22:35.705
- The Western?

22:35.706 --> 22:39.206
- No it's the crime drama with Rick Alan.

22:41.030 --> 22:42.785
You've been living in a hole.

22:42.786 --> 22:44.619
These aren't B movies.

22:47.450 --> 22:49.533
- Would you like a drink?

22:52.118 --> 22:52.951
- Yeah, please.

22:52.952 --> 22:54.034
A white wine.

22:57.066 --> 22:58.316
- A white wine.

23:00.636 --> 23:02.598
- Do I know you from somewhere?

23:02.599 --> 23:03.905
- Well

23:03.906 --> 23:04.794
- I totally remember.

23:04.795 --> 23:07.205
You used to work in a shoe shop

23:07.206 --> 23:08.623
in Oxford Street?

23:09.714 --> 23:12.473
- Yeah, that was a long time ago

23:12.474 --> 23:13.666
when I was a student.

23:13.667 --> 23:16.834
- You sold me a great pair of loafers.

23:18.310 --> 23:19.727
- I have loafers.

23:26.062 --> 23:29.062
- So my neighbor's a famous actress.

23:30.354 --> 23:32.391
Do you have time to date with your career?

23:32.392 --> 23:33.937
- Well, it's hard.

23:33.938 --> 23:35.557
Most people just want to date me

23:35.558 --> 23:37.793
because I'm in TV and filming.

23:37.794 --> 23:39.053
- Oh, sorry.

23:39.054 --> 23:41.001
It's my agent.

23:41.002 --> 23:42.002
Hi Jonathan.

23:43.553 --> 23:45.981
Yeah, I thought I'd be hearing from you.

23:45.982 --> 23:47.633
Yeah.

23:47.634 --> 23:49.057
What?

23:49.058 --> 23:50.977
With Walter Blackmore?

23:50.978 --> 23:52.509
Yeah.

23:52.510 --> 23:53.677
What?

23:53.678 --> 23:54.609
Tomorrow?

23:54.610 --> 23:56.001
Why so soon?

23:56.002 --> 23:57.429
No, no, no, it's not a problem.

23:57.430 --> 23:58.597
Not a problem.

23:58.598 --> 23:59.431
Alright.

23:59.432 --> 24:00.577
Brilliant.

24:00.578 --> 24:02.109
Get them to bike the script over for me.

24:02.110 --> 24:03.110
Super.

24:03.850 --> 24:04.869
Good to hear from you.

24:04.870 --> 24:06.620
Thanks Jonathan, bye!

24:07.854 --> 24:09.187
This is amazing.

24:10.374 --> 24:13.927
I could be working with Walter Blackmore.

24:13.928 --> 24:15.893
You know who he is right?

24:15.894 --> 24:16.894
- Yep.

24:20.555 --> 24:22.805
Do you get recognized much?

24:23.770 --> 24:25.569
- Well, literally yesterday this guy

24:25.570 --> 24:26.949
stopped me on the street.

24:26.950 --> 24:29.616
He said, hey you're Alice Richardson,

24:29.617 --> 24:30.931
can I have your number?

24:30.932 --> 24:32.301
And I said, Darling, to me you

24:32.302 --> 24:33.802
are just a number.

24:35.447 --> 24:36.452
Do you get it?

24:36.453 --> 24:37.453
- Yeah.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.805
- And then he said, can
I give you my number?

24:40.806 --> 24:44.825
I said, what for, just
in case I need a plumber?

24:44.826 --> 24:46.249
- Oh, he was a plumber.

24:46.250 --> 24:47.250
- No, silly.

24:52.893 --> 24:54.321
- I'm gonna watch all your movies, Alice.

24:54.322 --> 24:55.489
- All of them?

24:56.929 --> 24:57.762
- Yep.

24:57.763 --> 24:59.001
- You're so sweet.

24:59.002 --> 25:02.463
- I'm gonna be your biggest fan.

25:02.464 --> 25:04.205
You're wonderful Alice.

25:04.206 --> 25:05.419
You're beautiful,

25:05.420 --> 25:07.429
so funny and talented.

25:07.430 --> 25:09.097
I really enjoy this.

25:10.102 --> 25:13.019
- I'm just going to powder my nose.

25:57.650 --> 25:58.835
- Cut.

25:58.836 --> 26:00.586
We're gonna go again.

26:05.645 --> 26:07.311
- Tom, I just wanted to say

26:07.312 --> 26:09.875
I am so excited to be here.

26:09.876 --> 26:11.479
And I think you have done

26:11.480 --> 26:14.047
a really great job putting me with Walter.

26:14.048 --> 26:14.992
- It's good to have you here.

26:14.992 --> 26:15.908
Michelle Jones was going

26:15.908 --> 26:16.741
to play the part,

26:16.741 --> 26:17.574
but we found out she was pregnant

26:17.575 --> 26:18.575
at the last minute.

26:18.576 --> 26:19.536
- Oh.

26:19.537 --> 26:21.095
- Yeah, so we are really
happy you were free.

26:21.096 --> 26:23.887
Can you jump in first again?

26:23.888 --> 26:25.221
First positions.

26:27.620 --> 26:29.787
Sound, camera, and action.

26:45.355 --> 26:46.772
- May I sit here?

26:48.364 --> 26:49.364
- Yes.

26:54.950 --> 26:56.200
- Hi, I'm Dick.

26:59.165 --> 27:00.165
- Nina.

27:01.195 --> 27:03.588
- Do you come here often?

27:03.589 --> 27:05.189
- No.

27:05.190 --> 27:09.107
- Me neither so we've
got a lot in common then.

27:23.337 --> 27:24.920
- Welcome everyone.

27:26.395 --> 27:30.483
Today I am going to talk
about identification.

27:30.484 --> 27:33.817
All suffering comes from identification.

27:34.853 --> 27:36.891
I was just reading in the newspaper that

27:36.892 --> 27:38.600
the Chelsea hooligans rioted

27:38.601 --> 27:41.351
after Chelsea lost the cup final.

27:42.811 --> 27:45.402
So you can see that if you identify with

27:45.403 --> 27:47.403
your team and they lose,

27:48.412 --> 27:50.931
you will feel the pain.

27:50.932 --> 27:54.349
- Yeah, but Chelsea fans are cowards.

27:54.350 --> 27:55.808
- But I was just talking about

27:55.809 --> 27:57.680
identification in general.

27:57.681 --> 27:59.192
- Then why'd you bring up Chelsea?

27:59.193 --> 28:01.443
- Because I just read it in the paper,

28:01.444 --> 28:04.277
and it seemed like a good example.

28:05.633 --> 28:08.638
Okay, which club do you support?

28:08.639 --> 28:09.639
- West Ham.

28:11.486 --> 28:13.462
- You're used to losing a lot then.

28:13.463 --> 28:14.463
- What?

28:16.217 --> 28:17.906
- Okay, you don't need
to take it personally.

28:17.907 --> 28:20.012
- This is personal.

28:20.013 --> 28:22.285
- Hey, just relax.

28:22.286 --> 28:26.119
- Hey, we're talking
about enlightenment here.

28:30.835 --> 28:33.568
- We're all just one, aren't we?

28:33.569 --> 28:37.560
It's just all about finding
out who you really are.

28:37.561 --> 28:38.558
You see, it's so simple.

28:38.559 --> 28:40.499
If I just cut of both your arms

28:40.500 --> 28:41.399
and both your legs.

28:41.400 --> 28:44.625
- It's like, when you were hit,

28:44.626 --> 28:45.959
I could feel it.

28:48.292 --> 28:50.653
Although, no one was hit.

28:50.654 --> 28:52.487
Because there is no I.

28:53.875 --> 28:55.542
- Yeah, not anymore.

28:56.447 --> 28:58.170
Would you like a coffee?

28:58.171 --> 28:59.171
- Cut.

29:00.186 --> 29:01.186
- Tom.

29:03.027 --> 29:04.359
- I need a bit more sexual attraction,

29:04.360 --> 29:06.338
none of this wet fish stuff.

29:06.339 --> 29:08.696
- He is a wet fish, read the script.

29:08.697 --> 29:11.114
Who writes this stuff anyway?

29:11.998 --> 29:13.596
Okay, watch and learn,

29:13.597 --> 29:15.514
this is a pick up line.

29:18.867 --> 29:19.822
- Are you from heaven?

29:19.823 --> 29:21.386
Because every time I look in those

29:21.387 --> 29:24.377
eyes all I see is an angel.

29:24.378 --> 29:26.825
- Yeah that's because you are a sleazebag.

29:26.826 --> 29:29.243
- Tommy, I am taking a break.

29:33.037 --> 29:35.037
Can I make you a coffee?

29:37.030 --> 29:38.113
- Yes please.

29:42.249 --> 29:46.154
- Americano, latte, cappuccino, espresso?

29:46.155 --> 29:47.777
- Espresso please.

29:47.778 --> 29:49.111
- Espresso okay.

29:51.109 --> 29:55.042
- Look, I have been a fan
of yours for many years.

29:55.043 --> 29:56.594
- Single or double espresso?

29:56.595 --> 29:57.595
- Single.

29:59.096 --> 30:01.164
I watched all the episodes
of Don't be a Dick.

30:01.165 --> 30:03.597
It really is an honor to be part of it.

30:03.598 --> 30:06.636
- Well, we had to make
some changes, didn't we?

30:06.637 --> 30:09.103
We got ourselves a very nice new hot lady

30:09.104 --> 30:13.104
and then they added the
spiritual stuff as well.

30:13.963 --> 30:15.776
- Yeah, I love it.

30:15.777 --> 30:19.527
- And now it's all we
have lost God and hope,

30:20.787 --> 30:23.049
what's the meaning of life?

30:23.050 --> 30:24.727
It's all a crock of bullshit

30:24.728 --> 30:26.474
as far as I'm concerned.

30:26.475 --> 30:28.596
But you know, you go with what works in

30:28.597 --> 30:31.745
the moment until the next fad.

30:31.746 --> 30:32.913
- Yeah, right.

30:34.376 --> 30:35.376
- Nina.

30:37.563 --> 30:38.563
- Alice.

30:45.358 --> 30:46.812
- Thank you so much.

30:46.813 --> 30:48.230
- You're welcome.

30:50.648 --> 30:54.357
- So, you've got any
more projects coming up?

30:54.358 --> 30:55.553
- I just wrapped on Red Rocks,

30:55.554 --> 30:57.938
so for a nice change I get to concentrate

30:57.939 --> 30:59.522
on Don't be a Dick.

31:01.323 --> 31:03.213
- Red Rocks, that was with,

31:03.214 --> 31:04.961
oh God what was her name?

31:04.962 --> 31:07.116
- Lucy Anderson.

31:07.117 --> 31:08.791
- I read in the tabloids that she

31:08.792 --> 31:11.527
is putting her acting career on hold.

31:11.528 --> 31:12.872
- Yeah, little Lucy.

31:12.873 --> 31:14.373
She says it's because she wants

31:14.374 --> 31:15.919
to become a mother.

31:15.920 --> 31:19.879
But basically unfortunately
it's that lame excuse.

31:19.880 --> 31:22.092
She is basically just too old.

31:22.093 --> 31:23.261
Let me give you some advice.

31:23.262 --> 31:25.098
You need to look at your career

31:25.099 --> 31:27.549
like a soccer player does.

31:27.550 --> 31:29.830
You've got till maybe
somewhere in your thirties,

31:29.831 --> 31:31.797
the odd one or two will
make it until they're forty.

31:31.798 --> 31:33.453
And then they go into teaching

31:33.454 --> 31:35.378
or production or something.

31:35.379 --> 31:37.500
Listen, that is a hard truth I know.

31:37.501 --> 31:39.031
But I'm the good guy here,

31:39.032 --> 31:40.221
I tell it how it is instead

31:40.222 --> 31:43.044
of pretending it doesn't happen right.

31:43.045 --> 31:44.522
It is more graceful to go out

31:44.523 --> 31:46.341
on your own terms then

31:46.342 --> 31:48.342
it is to get kicked off.

31:49.976 --> 31:51.324
How old are you anyway?

31:51.325 --> 31:52.325
- 29.

31:54.459 --> 31:57.285
- Well baby we better get moving.

31:57.286 --> 31:58.222
Excuse me, can we get a couple

31:58.223 --> 32:00.055
more drinks here mate.

32:01.477 --> 32:04.375
Listen if you've got the chops.

32:04.376 --> 32:07.509
Maybe we could do a feature together.

32:07.510 --> 32:11.010
- Oh, now that I really like the sound of.

32:12.024 --> 32:13.282
- I thought you might.

32:13.283 --> 32:14.283
- So, hello.

32:15.124 --> 32:16.124
- Martin.

32:16.919 --> 32:17.819
Martin I am right in the middle

32:17.820 --> 32:19.980
of a conversation.

32:19.981 --> 32:21.981
- I'm Alice's boyfriend.

32:23.094 --> 32:24.515
- Boyfriend.

32:24.516 --> 32:27.394
- Martin, you are not my boyfriend.

32:27.395 --> 32:29.268
- Oh, so our kiss meant nothing?

32:29.269 --> 32:31.519
- This is Walter Blackmore.

32:32.437 --> 32:34.018
- Why are you doing this to me Alice?

32:34.019 --> 32:35.511
- Okay, you know what sweetheart,

32:35.512 --> 32:36.662
you need to sort your shit out

32:36.663 --> 32:37.866
with your boyfriend first.

32:37.867 --> 32:38.771
- No, no, no.

32:38.771 --> 32:39.670
Just wait.

32:39.671 --> 32:43.101
Walter, honestly I can explain it to you.

32:43.102 --> 32:44.769
- Oh for fucks sake.

32:47.227 --> 32:50.310
- I thought we had something special.

32:51.259 --> 32:53.975
- Have you been following me?

32:53.976 --> 32:55.957
- So, I'm not allowed to
have a drink in this pub?

32:55.958 --> 32:56.958
- Oh my God.

32:57.830 --> 32:59.080
Leave me alone.

33:05.841 --> 33:07.522
- Do you like cake daddy?

33:07.523 --> 33:09.220
- Yes I do.

33:09.221 --> 33:11.943
- Mum says you ate another woman's cake.

33:11.944 --> 33:12.944
- What?

33:14.024 --> 33:17.200
- She said you ate another woman's cake

33:17.201 --> 33:19.506
- Another woman's cake?

33:19.507 --> 33:21.842
- Yeah, she said that's why she left.

33:21.843 --> 33:24.402
- Well that's not exactly true.

33:24.403 --> 33:27.522
I didn't eat another woman's cake.

33:27.523 --> 33:29.143
- I eat cake at Jennie's house

33:29.144 --> 33:31.004
and mum doesn't mind that.

33:31.005 --> 33:32.684
- It's just that when you're married

33:32.685 --> 33:36.386
you are not allowed to
eat other people's cake.

33:36.387 --> 33:37.666
- You can only eat mum's cake?

33:37.667 --> 33:38.882
- Yeah.

33:38.883 --> 33:40.162
- And she can only eat your cake?

33:40.163 --> 33:41.163
- Yeah.

33:42.863 --> 33:44.983
- I think you two are
very bad at marriage then

33:44.984 --> 33:48.764
because I've seen you both
eat other people's cake.

33:48.765 --> 33:50.402
- Really?

33:50.403 --> 33:52.402
- We have it at grandma's,

33:52.403 --> 33:56.146
when we're in Spain, and at birthdays.

33:56.147 --> 33:57.144
- Yes.

33:57.145 --> 33:58.727
But that's allowed.

34:00.662 --> 34:03.586
- Basically, mum can't
have cake from another man

34:03.587 --> 34:06.920
and I can't eat cake from another woman.

34:07.923 --> 34:09.042
So we can eat it as long

34:09.043 --> 34:10.802
as it's not directly from

34:10.803 --> 34:12.219
the opposite sex

34:16.284 --> 34:17.118
or family or friends.

34:17.119 --> 34:20.993
Family, friends, restaurants
and parties are okay.

34:20.994 --> 34:23.594
- And you ate another woman's cake?

34:23.596 --> 34:24.775
- I didn't eat it,

34:24.777 --> 34:26.779
I just looked at it.

34:26.780 --> 34:29.052
- You just looked at it?

34:29.053 --> 34:30.315
- I looked at it when I was meant

34:30.315 --> 34:32.315
to be eating your mum's.

34:46.902 --> 34:47.905
- Mummy.

34:47.906 --> 34:49.239
- Hello sweetie,

34:50.647 --> 34:51.647
come on in.

34:54.183 --> 34:55.185
- How are you?

34:55.186 --> 34:56.853
- Yeah, I'm alright.

34:57.932 --> 35:00.523
I've got a job on Don't be a Dick.

35:00.524 --> 35:01.883
- Don't be a Dick?

35:01.884 --> 35:02.884
Wow, great.

35:04.245 --> 35:06.406
Can I come in, talk
about your custody papers

35:06.407 --> 35:07.824
and your divorce?

35:10.204 --> 35:12.145
- Just tell me.

35:12.146 --> 35:14.419
What do you want to say?

35:14.420 --> 35:16.523
- I can't believe this divorce.

35:16.524 --> 35:18.843
Divorce because I flirt with a colleague.

35:18.844 --> 35:20.086
- And the rest Mark.

35:20.087 --> 35:21.163
- There is no rest.

35:21.164 --> 35:23.366
I kissed her once and that's it.

35:23.367 --> 35:25.382
- We hadn't had sex in months.

35:25.383 --> 35:27.185
You could walk into a room

35:27.186 --> 35:30.518
and I'd be naked and you
wouldn't even notice.

35:30.519 --> 35:31.585
A woman knows.

35:31.586 --> 35:32.886
- You are here in London while

35:32.887 --> 35:34.225
I'm with her every night.

35:34.226 --> 35:35.559
- Yeah blame me.

35:39.047 --> 35:40.523
- You want it like this?

35:40.524 --> 35:41.942
Do you like this?

35:41.943 --> 35:43.403
Is this the way you want it?

35:43.404 --> 35:45.425
You want me to file for full divorce,

35:45.426 --> 35:46.642
full custody and the house?

35:46.643 --> 35:49.222
Is that what you want?

35:49.223 --> 35:50.662
Because I've spoken to a lawyer

35:50.663 --> 35:54.223
and they've assured me I will win.

35:54.224 --> 35:57.307
- And your true colors shine through.

36:03.341 --> 36:05.424
- I still love you Alice.

36:12.466 --> 36:14.216
- I'm not doing this.

36:34.983 --> 36:36.625
- I love Don't be a Dick.

36:36.626 --> 36:37.926
I've seen all of the episodes.

36:37.927 --> 36:38.924
- Really?

36:38.925 --> 36:40.422
- Yeah, you write for it don't you?

36:40.423 --> 36:41.482
- Yeah.

36:41.483 --> 36:43.142
- Did you write for all seven seasons?

36:43.143 --> 36:44.162
- Yeah.

36:44.163 --> 36:45.163
- Cool.

36:48.242 --> 36:49.745
I write.

36:49.746 --> 36:50.802
- Oh, really?

36:50.803 --> 36:52.646
Anything I might know?

36:52.647 --> 36:56.923
- I'm focusing more on
the writing at the moment.

36:56.924 --> 36:58.977
I haven't really sent anything out.

36:58.978 --> 36:59.978
- Oh, okay.

37:01.767 --> 37:04.582
- The writing on this is incredible.

37:04.583 --> 37:05.926
I mean those jokes that Dick tells

37:05.927 --> 37:09.177
about your weight are always hilarious.

37:10.764 --> 37:14.182
Not that you are
overweight really, I mean.

37:14.183 --> 37:15.461
Maybe a little above average.

37:15.462 --> 37:16.683
But it's not like you need lifting

37:16.684 --> 37:20.517
out of the house by a
crane or anything is it?

37:21.986 --> 37:25.803
- Oh Walter, I'm sorry about
what happened yesterday.

37:25.804 --> 37:28.387
It's my creepy neighbor Martin.

37:29.382 --> 37:32.246
- You make out with all
your creepy neighbors?

37:32.247 --> 37:34.203
- It was just a kiss
on the cheek good bye.

37:34.204 --> 37:36.283
He is a total freak.

37:36.284 --> 37:38.201
- Okay next scene guys.

37:47.026 --> 37:49.364
- Wow, it looks amazing.

37:49.365 --> 37:52.282
- You wait till you see the inside.

37:58.967 --> 37:59.967
- Hello?

38:01.563 --> 38:02.563
Alice?

38:06.887 --> 38:07.887
Hi Anna.

38:49.063 --> 38:51.542
- Hello there, sign here please.

38:51.543 --> 38:52.545
- Sign?

38:52.546 --> 38:53.546
- Yeah.

38:55.244 --> 38:56.244
- Thank you.

38:57.484 --> 38:59.484
Good luck in court mate.

39:12.066 --> 39:13.063
- You know what?

39:13.064 --> 39:15.730
I want to do a feature with you.

39:16.807 --> 39:18.262
My dad's got one that's come up.

39:18.263 --> 39:19.462
The production company wants me

39:19.463 --> 39:22.203
to star in it, of course.

39:22.204 --> 39:24.262
But he actually thinks you'd be

39:24.263 --> 39:26.180
a perfect leading lady.

39:31.607 --> 39:34.002
And you should join the Blackmore Agency.

39:34.003 --> 39:35.766
- I'm with Jonathan.

39:35.767 --> 39:37.563
- My dad gets approached double, triple

39:37.564 --> 39:41.505
what Jonathan does by
casting directors, producers.

39:41.506 --> 39:43.126
- I've been with him since the beginning.

39:43.127 --> 39:46.127
- He knows everybody who is anybody.

39:49.570 --> 39:52.320
- All right, I'll think about it.

39:53.970 --> 39:56.465
- Oh my god, look at your body.

39:56.466 --> 39:57.943
Look at it, it's amazing.

39:57.944 --> 40:00.746
- That is enough Walter.

40:00.747 --> 40:01.846
- Oh my God that's beautiful.

40:01.847 --> 40:02.847
- Stop it.

40:17.948 --> 40:19.781
- Do you want a drink?

40:20.642 --> 40:22.546
- Yes, a coffee please.

40:22.547 --> 40:24.529
- A coffee, sure.

40:24.530 --> 40:25.910
- Actually, make that a shot.

40:25.911 --> 40:27.009
- A shot?

40:27.010 --> 40:28.870
- Tequila, vodka, whatever you got.

40:28.871 --> 40:30.166
- It's not even 11 AM.

40:30.167 --> 40:31.670
- Where am I?

40:31.671 --> 40:33.590
An AA meeting?

40:33.591 --> 40:36.427
I have an impossible decision to make.

40:36.428 --> 40:38.587
- Between vodka and tequila?

40:38.588 --> 40:41.323
- I have a meeting in half

40:41.324 --> 40:43.824
an hour about changing agents.

40:46.844 --> 40:49.302
- Why don't you just flip a coin?

40:49.303 --> 40:50.582
- Flip a coin?

40:50.583 --> 40:51.750
- Flip a coin.

40:53.047 --> 40:54.123
- Is that how you ended up running

40:54.124 --> 40:55.823
a pub instead of a pizzeria?

40:55.824 --> 40:56.843
- Absolutely.

40:56.844 --> 40:58.600
That's how I ended up serving alcohol

40:58.601 --> 41:02.566
to desperate people like you at 11 AM.

41:02.567 --> 41:03.985
Heads or tails?

41:03.986 --> 41:06.945
- I'm not flipping a coin
to make this decision.

41:06.946 --> 41:08.726
- Heads is your current agency.

41:08.727 --> 41:10.662
Tail is the new agency.

41:10.663 --> 41:12.330
Tell me their names?

41:13.847 --> 41:16.283
- I'm with Jonathan Howard associates.

41:16.284 --> 41:18.784
The other is Blackmore agency.

41:20.004 --> 41:23.504
- Okay, head is Howard, tail is Blackmore.

41:24.386 --> 41:29.286
- Which side of the coin
do you hope it's gonna be?

41:29.287 --> 41:31.704
I know you have a preference.

41:32.662 --> 41:34.225
It's not the coin,

41:34.226 --> 41:37.643
it's your heart that gave you the answer.

41:44.887 --> 41:47.105
- Alice, Walter's told me that you want

41:47.106 --> 41:49.602
to invest in our agency.

41:49.603 --> 41:50.603
- Invest?

41:51.765 --> 41:56.023
I heard that you were
looking to represent me

41:56.024 --> 41:59.947
and that there might be a
movie that I'd be right for.

41:59.948 --> 42:02.027
- Of course, that's a given.

42:02.028 --> 42:03.626
But let's talk about the investment.

42:03.627 --> 42:05.265
How much can you invest?

42:05.266 --> 42:06.621
- Invest?

42:06.622 --> 42:10.289
No I was just interested
in changing agents.

42:11.804 --> 42:13.984
- You don't have any savings?

42:13.985 --> 42:15.867
- Well, of course I do.

42:15.868 --> 42:18.663
- We can offer six percent of the stock.

42:18.664 --> 42:20.864
Our expected interest on investment

42:20.865 --> 42:23.423
is over 17% on a yearly basis.

42:23.424 --> 42:25.924
- 17% that's really good.

42:26.988 --> 42:30.406
But what about my role in the new movie.

42:30.407 --> 42:32.246
- Think bigger Alice.

42:32.247 --> 42:34.187
As an investor in our
agency we will ensure

42:34.188 --> 42:35.762
that you get first choice

42:35.763 --> 42:39.680
of auditions leading you
to all the main roles.

42:42.284 --> 42:45.067
So six percent is £54,000.

42:45.068 --> 42:46.568
Is that a problem?

42:49.265 --> 42:52.543
- Well, that's nearly all my savings.

42:52.544 --> 42:55.243
- You don't believe in your own talent?

42:55.244 --> 42:56.722
- Of course I do.

42:56.723 --> 42:58.683
I'm nominated.

42:58.684 --> 43:00.646
I'm going to have to
speak to Jonathan first.

43:00.647 --> 43:02.230
- Oh come on Alice.

43:02.231 --> 43:04.067
Jonathan has never
allowed you the confidence

43:04.068 --> 43:06.205
that your talent deserves.

43:06.206 --> 43:08.789
This should be an absolute yes.

43:10.309 --> 43:11.976
I believe in myself,

43:13.068 --> 43:15.068
I believe in my success.

43:15.968 --> 43:17.718
But most importantly,

43:18.710 --> 43:20.627
I believe in you Alice.

43:23.207 --> 43:26.369
Blackmore agencies will get you there.

43:26.370 --> 43:28.120
I will get you there.

43:56.071 --> 43:57.190
- Sorry.

43:57.191 --> 43:59.387
- No, now is not the right time Martin.

43:59.388 --> 44:00.449
I'm going to the movie awards

44:00.450 --> 44:02.127
and I need to leave in 20 minutes.

44:02.128 --> 44:04.587
- Can you please accept these flowers?

44:04.588 --> 44:06.987
- Just to be clear.

44:06.988 --> 44:09.889
There is nothing between us okay?

44:09.890 --> 44:12.907
Let's just say hi as neighbors, that's it.

44:12.908 --> 44:13.910
- Hi.

44:13.911 --> 44:14.911
- Not now.

44:29.042 --> 44:30.459
- Are you joking?

44:35.287 --> 44:36.287
- Hi mummy!

44:37.367 --> 44:38.450
- Hi sweetie!

44:40.151 --> 44:43.568
- Wow Alice, you look gorgeous, gorgeous.

44:44.631 --> 44:47.350
Killer dress for the awards.

44:47.351 --> 44:48.351
Nervous?

44:49.190 --> 44:51.440
- Yeah, yeah, a little bit.

44:54.290 --> 44:55.287
- Come on in sweetie,

44:55.288 --> 44:56.620
go to your room.

45:00.168 --> 45:02.587
- Please tell the babysitter she

45:02.588 --> 45:04.849
has been a little bit ill this week.

45:04.850 --> 45:06.966
A bit of a tummy problem.

45:06.967 --> 45:09.446
- Yes I will tell her.

45:09.447 --> 45:13.197
- The doctor is saying
divorce causes stress.

45:14.348 --> 45:15.348
- Okay.

45:18.988 --> 45:20.086
- Monday at seven.

45:20.087 --> 45:21.087
- Yeah.

45:23.510 --> 45:25.943
- By the way, good luck tonight.

45:25.944 --> 45:27.194
- Thanks, Mark.

45:32.311 --> 45:33.311
- Shit.

45:45.090 --> 45:46.107
Martin.

45:46.108 --> 45:47.108
- Alice.

45:47.927 --> 45:49.627
- Thank you for the flowers.

45:49.628 --> 45:51.425
I really love them.

45:51.426 --> 45:53.467
And I am sorry for all the horrible things

45:53.468 --> 45:54.885
I've said to you.

45:55.970 --> 45:58.150
I really like you.

45:58.151 --> 46:00.546
But just as a friend, okay.

46:00.547 --> 46:02.486
- Yeah, just as a friend.

46:02.487 --> 46:05.009
- We're neighbors and it's always nice

46:05.010 --> 46:07.306
to be friends with neighbors.

46:07.307 --> 46:08.870
- Yeah.

46:08.871 --> 46:13.329
- And as neighbors we help
each other out, right?

46:13.330 --> 46:14.330
- Yeah.

46:15.250 --> 46:17.387
- Oh, you're so sweet.

46:17.388 --> 46:21.190
As you know, I'm going to
an awards ceremony tonight.

46:21.191 --> 46:23.191
I'm up for best actress.

46:24.107 --> 46:25.345
It's massive.

46:25.346 --> 46:27.270
And I really need to be there.

46:27.271 --> 46:28.289
- You want me to come?

46:28.290 --> 46:29.290
- No.

46:30.615 --> 46:32.806
- I've actually got a little black jacket.

46:32.807 --> 46:35.190
I bought it for my nan's funeral.

46:35.191 --> 46:36.608
- Martin, Martin,

46:38.025 --> 46:42.207
could you look after Anna for me tonight?

46:42.208 --> 46:46.128
- Yeah, of course, it would be an honor.

46:46.129 --> 46:47.590
- Thank you.

46:47.591 --> 46:49.387
You are really helping me out.

46:49.388 --> 46:51.446
You can watch TV,

46:51.447 --> 46:54.086
fall asleep on my couch
until I get back okay?

46:54.087 --> 46:55.649
- Okay, yeah, I'll do that.

46:55.650 --> 46:57.910
- Thank you Martin.

46:57.911 --> 46:59.578
- I almost lost you.

47:02.900 --> 47:06.138
I'm so glad we have
found each other again.

47:06.139 --> 47:07.972
I need you in my life.

47:12.319 --> 47:14.843
- You know I'm nominated
for best actress right?

47:14.844 --> 47:15.844
- Yes.

47:17.080 --> 47:21.207
- Well, tonight they are
announcing who is winning

47:21.208 --> 47:25.125
the award and they really
want me to be there.

47:26.179 --> 47:28.762
So I want you to be a big girl.

47:29.644 --> 47:33.242
You can stay up and watch
cartoons until eight o clock,

47:33.243 --> 47:37.142
but then you have to put
yourself to bed okay?

47:37.143 --> 47:38.143
- 8:30?

47:39.944 --> 47:41.921
- No answering the door okay?

47:41.922 --> 47:42.922
Promise?

47:58.583 --> 48:02.750
- Alice, Walter, what an
exciting evening for us all.

48:06.743 --> 48:10.243
One nomination for you and two for Walter.

48:12.940 --> 48:15.803
- I'm so proud of my Dick.

48:15.804 --> 48:17.721
But his name is Walter.

48:20.002 --> 48:21.187
- Cally.

48:21.188 --> 48:22.299
- How are you feeling?

48:22.300 --> 48:23.419
- A little bit nervous.

48:23.420 --> 48:24.801
- You'll be fine.

48:24.802 --> 48:25.899
- I don't understand why you're

48:25.900 --> 48:27.302
not nominated you know.

48:27.303 --> 48:29.019
You are such a good actress.

48:29.020 --> 48:30.401
- Well thank you.

48:30.402 --> 48:34.057
- So there is a guy with
a dog in a pub right,

48:34.058 --> 48:36.059
watching footie on the TV.

48:36.060 --> 48:37.942
Aston Villa getting beating three nil

48:37.943 --> 48:40.443
and when the final whistle goes,

48:40.444 --> 48:42.182
the dog lies on his back

48:42.183 --> 48:44.338
with his feet up in the air playing dead.

48:44.339 --> 48:45.338
The bartender goes,

48:45.339 --> 48:47.803
what does he do when they win?

48:47.804 --> 48:50.423
The guy goes, I have no idea,

48:50.424 --> 48:54.379
I've only had the dog for eight months.

48:54.380 --> 48:55.761
- Walter says I need to treat my career

48:55.762 --> 48:57.462
more like a football player.

48:57.463 --> 48:58.539
- Oh, what like earn money

48:58.540 --> 49:00.001
without using your brains?

49:00.002 --> 49:01.002
Cheers.

49:03.100 --> 49:05.360
- Well he says you have your career

49:05.361 --> 49:06.939
until somewhere in your thirties

49:06.940 --> 49:10.385
and then go into coaching or training.

49:10.386 --> 49:12.216
- So I'm not interrupting any conversation

49:12.217 --> 49:14.481
of any value whatsoever I assume?

49:14.482 --> 49:16.625
- Well actually I was
just telling Cally about

49:16.626 --> 49:20.417
the comparison you made between
footballers and actresses.

49:20.418 --> 49:21.917
- Yes, that's true.

49:21.918 --> 49:23.781
Men are rather more like fine wine,

49:23.782 --> 49:26.539
they get better with age.

49:26.540 --> 49:29.281
Whereas women are rather more

49:29.282 --> 49:31.115
like milk aren't they?

49:33.218 --> 49:35.356
- You're right about men being like wine.

49:35.357 --> 49:39.357
Too much of their crap
will give you a headache.

49:42.780 --> 49:44.421
- Do not let Walter put you down.

49:44.422 --> 49:47.339
- Oh no, I know Walter pretty well.

49:56.561 --> 49:59.643
- Last year they asked me
to announce best actress

49:59.644 --> 50:02.981
and this year they've asked me again.

50:02.982 --> 50:06.149
I guess they know I'm good with women.

50:07.644 --> 50:09.839
- Sarah Lin won last year

50:09.840 --> 50:12.720
and ever since we have
seen her everywhere.

50:12.721 --> 50:13.721
Literally.

50:16.364 --> 50:20.531
You know the nude pictures
that were leaked online?

50:25.302 --> 50:27.885
And the award for best actress,

50:29.964 --> 50:31.881
is it Katherine Height?

50:38.300 --> 50:39.717
No, no, sit down.

50:41.980 --> 50:44.147
The award for best actress

50:46.363 --> 50:48.446
goes to Alice Richardson.

51:32.581 --> 51:33.680
- Thank you.

51:33.681 --> 51:35.840
Thank you so much.

51:35.841 --> 51:37.508
You are magnificent.

51:39.644 --> 51:42.539
I want to thank my fabulous directors

51:42.540 --> 51:45.493
Ismael Lotz and Tom Deville

51:45.494 --> 51:47.827
for seeing all of my talent.

51:49.020 --> 51:52.103
Oh and my boyfriend Walter Blackmore,

51:53.559 --> 51:55.800
thank you darling.

51:55.801 --> 51:58.218
Thank you so much, thank you.

52:03.521 --> 52:05.938
Thank you, thank you so much.

52:08.641 --> 52:10.724
Oh, it's good to see you.

52:15.884 --> 52:17.259
- If they would give an award

52:17.260 --> 52:18.699
for the hottest actress,

52:18.700 --> 52:19.941
I wouldn't just give you one,

52:19.942 --> 52:21.359
I'd give you two.

52:23.001 --> 52:24.421
- It's a curse being beautiful.

52:24.422 --> 52:26.005
- Yes I understand.

52:28.044 --> 52:31.199
Look, if there is any way I can help

52:31.200 --> 52:33.499
you through these tough times,

52:33.500 --> 52:35.563
why don't you let me know?

52:35.564 --> 52:37.259
- Thank you.

52:37.260 --> 52:40.677
Please make me your next charity project.

52:43.740 --> 52:45.381
- Bridget.

52:45.382 --> 52:47.323
You might be able to help me actually.

52:47.324 --> 52:50.581
Cause you're too good to be true.

52:50.582 --> 52:53.620
I can't take my eyes off you.

52:53.621 --> 52:57.288
- Walter, darling, the
limousine is waiting.

53:09.084 --> 53:11.334
- What an incredible night.

53:12.961 --> 53:15.378
I'm sorry you didn't win too.

53:18.422 --> 53:21.141
- I already have eleven
of those ugly statues.

53:21.142 --> 53:22.392
- Yeah, I know.

53:23.820 --> 53:26.021
Walter, you know those photos

53:26.022 --> 53:28.501
of me you have by the pool.

53:28.502 --> 53:30.835
Can you delete those please?

53:32.018 --> 53:34.421
It's not that I don't
trust you or anything,

53:34.422 --> 53:36.353
I just don't want them to end up

53:36.354 --> 53:37.797
on the internet you know.

53:37.798 --> 53:39.136
I don't want to be the next

53:39.137 --> 53:42.000
naked award winning actress.

53:42.001 --> 53:43.099
- They're off my phone.

53:43.100 --> 53:44.100
- Thank you.

53:45.457 --> 53:47.124
- Safe on my laptop.

53:49.019 --> 53:50.173
- Don't be funny Walter,

53:50.174 --> 53:51.499
delete them please.

53:51.500 --> 53:52.496
- Don't be such a prude.

53:52.497 --> 53:53.877
It kind of turns me on

53:53.878 --> 53:56.176
to think that people could see you naked.

53:56.177 --> 53:59.510
- Hey I trusted you with those pictures.

54:02.195 --> 54:04.437
- You invite me in?

54:04.438 --> 54:05.935
- No, my daughter is upstairs,

54:05.936 --> 54:07.692
I don't think it's a good idea tonight.

54:07.693 --> 54:08.799
- You have a daughter?

54:08.800 --> 54:10.358
- Yes.

54:10.359 --> 54:11.963
- When were you going
to tell me about that?

54:11.964 --> 54:15.019
- Well I'm not exactly hiding it from you.

54:15.020 --> 54:16.619
- You know what, fucking get out!

54:16.620 --> 54:17.617
- What?

54:17.618 --> 54:18.736
- Get the fuck out of the car!

54:18.737 --> 54:21.397
- Hang on, you're not getting laid

54:21.398 --> 54:23.756
so I have to get out?

54:23.757 --> 54:24.775
- Yes, you know what.

54:24.776 --> 54:26.834
This ride has become
complete waste of fuel.

54:26.835 --> 54:28.335
- Fuck you Walter.

54:36.038 --> 54:37.455
Anna? Anna? Anna?

54:43.420 --> 54:45.096
- So, did you win?

54:45.097 --> 54:47.014
- Martin, Anna is gone.

54:49.137 --> 54:50.172
- I was watching a movie till late

54:50.173 --> 54:51.579
and someone randomly knocked on the door.

54:51.580 --> 54:53.116
- Where is she?

54:53.117 --> 54:54.316
- I opened the door and there

54:54.317 --> 54:55.360
was this little girl crying.

54:55.361 --> 54:56.640
- Tell me where she is.

54:56.641 --> 54:58.294
What have you done with her you freak.

54:58.295 --> 54:59.393
- She's with her dad.

54:59.394 --> 55:00.400
- What?

55:00.401 --> 55:01.520
- She's with her dad.

55:01.521 --> 55:03.200
She had a headache, she
felt nauseous, and fever

55:03.201 --> 55:05.136
and so I took her to see her father.

55:05.137 --> 55:06.137
- Oh fuck.

55:07.877 --> 55:08.880
- I really think you need

55:08.881 --> 55:10.240
a bit more responsibility Alice.

55:10.241 --> 55:11.792
You can't leave your child home alone.

55:11.793 --> 55:12.793
- Shut up.

55:13.537 --> 55:14.677
- No you shut up.

55:14.678 --> 55:16.400
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

55:16.401 --> 55:17.651
- Where's Anna?

55:22.060 --> 55:23.211
- Hi mum.

55:23.212 --> 55:24.295
- Sweetheart.

55:25.318 --> 55:27.819
- I was feeling sick mummy.

55:27.820 --> 55:31.056
- I know baby, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

55:31.057 --> 55:34.724
- Anna, mum and dad
will be right back okay.

55:37.857 --> 55:39.499
- Have you gone insane?

55:39.500 --> 55:40.560
You're leaving a seven year old

55:40.561 --> 55:42.539
girl home alone all night?

55:42.540 --> 55:43.600
You know what I think.

55:43.601 --> 55:44.816
I think you wanted out.

55:44.817 --> 55:46.016
You're using all this

55:46.017 --> 55:48.277
because you can't admit to yourself

55:48.278 --> 55:49.280
that you don't want Anna

55:49.281 --> 55:50.993
and you don't want me.

55:50.994 --> 55:52.327
- I'd better go.

55:55.958 --> 55:57.616
- By the way,

55:57.617 --> 55:59.637
leaving Anna home alone will damage you

55:59.638 --> 56:01.115
in a custody hearing.

56:01.116 --> 56:03.366
Even for an awards evening.

56:07.100 --> 56:08.100
- I won.

56:14.459 --> 56:16.376
- No, tonight you lost.

56:31.617 --> 56:32.939
- So what do you think?

56:32.940 --> 56:34.197
- I don't know Dick,

56:34.198 --> 56:36.281
I think it's a bit weird.

56:37.361 --> 56:38.737
For the first time in my life

56:38.738 --> 56:40.997
I'm doing something meaningful.

56:40.998 --> 56:43.135
I am helping people.

56:43.136 --> 56:44.879
Well, actually I am helping raise

56:44.880 --> 56:49.019
the levels of consciousness in humanity.

56:49.020 --> 56:50.770
- In an orange dress?

56:52.557 --> 56:54.276
- I'm a spiritual teacher now Leo.

56:54.277 --> 56:56.298
This is what we wear.

56:56.299 --> 56:57.557
- Why?

56:57.558 --> 56:58.560
- What do you mean why?

56:58.561 --> 57:00.299
There is no why.

57:00.300 --> 57:03.536
We are showing people the light.

57:03.537 --> 57:05.179
Here, we help them connect

57:05.180 --> 57:06.997
with their true selves.

57:06.998 --> 57:09.248
Exploring your true nature.

57:12.697 --> 57:14.240
Okay whatever.

57:14.241 --> 57:16.824
Now, I do need some help though

57:17.917 --> 57:20.420
tomorrow night with the talk.

57:20.421 --> 57:23.600
Would you sit on door
and collect the money?

57:23.601 --> 57:24.601
- Yeah.

57:26.444 --> 57:27.441
- See?

57:27.442 --> 57:29.097
Sri Dickji.

57:29.098 --> 57:30.515
It works I think.

57:31.740 --> 57:33.740
- It doesn't even rhyme.

57:41.660 --> 57:42.993
Dick, it's time!

57:45.638 --> 57:47.221
- How many people are there?

57:47.222 --> 57:48.222
- Just six.

57:52.678 --> 57:55.317
- It's not about quantity Leo.

57:55.318 --> 57:56.778
- I don't mind, I don't have to pay

57:56.779 --> 57:58.612
the rent for the room.

58:25.241 --> 58:26.241
- Namaste.

58:29.201 --> 58:32.540
Welcome to this meeting in truth.

58:32.541 --> 58:34.374
My name is Sri Dickji.

58:37.502 --> 58:41.504
Today we're going to talk
about self-realization.

58:41.505 --> 58:44.864
Many people suffer because
they believe themselves

58:44.865 --> 58:46.818
to be a separate person.

58:46.819 --> 58:48.819
But this is an illusion.

58:50.261 --> 58:51.261
- Why?

58:52.625 --> 58:54.901
- Because you are simply happening,

58:54.902 --> 58:56.821
but our brains, your brain,

58:56.822 --> 59:00.017
creates this self-awareness so you view

59:00.018 --> 59:03.120
yourself, we all do, as an I.

59:03.121 --> 59:04.121
- And so?

59:05.041 --> 59:06.374
- There is no I.

59:07.388 --> 59:09.679
- But I chose to come to this meeting.

59:09.680 --> 59:14.645
- Ah, that's just a story
you're telling yourself.

59:14.646 --> 59:17.941
- And that's the story
you're telling yourself.

59:17.942 --> 59:21.403
- And Sandra, you may not
ask any more questions.

59:21.404 --> 59:22.739
- Why not?

59:22.740 --> 59:24.955
- Because you do not understand.

59:24.956 --> 59:28.789
- Well maybe you are not
telling it very well.

59:30.502 --> 59:31.584
- If you are identified

59:31.585 --> 59:34.880
with your body and your thoughts,

59:34.881 --> 59:37.701
then you don't see the
whole overview, do you?

59:37.702 --> 59:40.202
So it just begs that question,

59:41.162 --> 59:43.039
are you a duck or are you a bird?

59:43.040 --> 59:44.040
- Eagle.

59:48.022 --> 59:49.680
- Are you an eagle or are you a bird?

59:49.681 --> 59:50.681
- Duck.

59:52.081 --> 59:53.914
Eagle or a Duck, Dick.

59:55.046 --> 59:57.184
- Are you an eagle or are you a duck?

59:57.185 --> 59:59.435
Because an eagle flies high

01:00:00.726 --> 01:00:02.944
and has a great overview,

01:00:02.945 --> 01:00:05.195
whereas a duck just waddles

01:00:06.043 --> 01:00:08.376
and flies to and then swims.

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:17.061
- So are there any more questions?

01:00:17.062 --> 01:00:18.229
- Yes, Sandra?

01:00:20.241 --> 01:00:24.324
- Did you just ask me if
I am an eagle or a Duck?

01:00:38.401 --> 01:00:39.781
- And cut.

01:00:39.782 --> 01:00:41.120
Have lunch everybody, take a break.

01:00:41.121 --> 01:00:42.121
Thank you.

01:00:43.841 --> 01:00:45.758
- Well done Sri Dickji.

01:00:47.379 --> 01:00:48.379
- Thank you.

01:00:50.238 --> 01:00:51.739
Do you know that some gurus they

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:54.443
use their status to get sex.

01:00:54.444 --> 01:00:55.824
- Really?

01:00:55.825 --> 01:00:58.720
- Think you'd fall for that?

01:00:58.721 --> 01:01:01.504
- I'd see straight through it.

01:01:01.505 --> 01:01:02.960
But you are more than welcome

01:01:02.961 --> 01:01:04.358
to come back to my apartment

01:01:04.359 --> 01:01:08.200
for some philosophical
discussion and herbal tea.

01:01:08.201 --> 01:01:12.261
- I'm sure Sri Dickji would be honored,

01:01:12.262 --> 01:01:14.762
but he might prefer a whiskey.

01:01:18.662 --> 01:01:21.563
- Thank you my sweet servant.

01:01:21.564 --> 01:01:23.999
I can't stay too late.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.461
- Oh.

01:01:25.462 --> 01:01:27.163
- I've got one of those boring investor

01:01:27.164 --> 01:01:29.743
parties to go to with my dad.

01:01:29.744 --> 01:01:34.501
- But I thought you had
something to make up to me?

01:01:34.502 --> 01:01:37.180
- Well it's not that I like
going to those parties.

01:01:37.181 --> 01:01:40.931
- I'm trying so hard
to have a nice evening.

01:01:43.724 --> 01:01:45.701
All I want is for you

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:47.858
to spend the night with me.

01:01:47.859 --> 01:01:51.664
You know how much I
love making love to you.

01:01:51.665 --> 01:01:53.323
Please?

01:01:53.324 --> 01:01:55.324
Send your dad a message.

01:02:37.418 --> 01:02:38.418
- Alice?

01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:41.077
- You're a computer programmer right?

01:02:41.078 --> 01:02:45.237
- Yeah, in PHP, C++, Javascript.

01:02:45.238 --> 01:02:46.757
- I just need you to get into this laptop.

01:02:46.758 --> 01:02:48.496
I need the password.

01:02:48.497 --> 01:02:50.000
- That would take me at least an hour.

01:02:50.001 --> 01:02:51.637
- Do it.

01:02:51.638 --> 01:02:52.640
- I'm not going to hack someone's

01:02:52.641 --> 01:02:53.979
laptop without knowing why.

01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:55.840
- I don't have time to explain.

01:02:55.841 --> 01:02:57.360
You know Walter Blackmore, the actor.

01:02:57.361 --> 01:02:58.619
Well this is his laptop.

01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:00.080
I need the password.

01:03:00.081 --> 01:03:03.397
Please Martin, you're
the only man I can trust.

01:03:03.398 --> 01:03:05.760
- Okay, I'll bring it back in the morning.

01:03:05.761 --> 01:03:07.094
- No, do it now.

01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:10.517
I'll come back and pick it up in an hour.

01:03:10.518 --> 01:03:11.920
- It's the middle of the night.

01:03:11.921 --> 01:03:15.520
- Please Martin, I'd be really grateful.

01:03:15.521 --> 01:03:16.891
Please?

01:03:16.892 --> 01:03:18.975
- Okay, consider it done.

01:03:55.657 --> 01:03:56.907
- Alice, Alice.

01:04:00.698 --> 01:04:01.698
- Martin.

01:04:03.558 --> 01:04:04.757
- What the fuck?

01:04:04.758 --> 01:04:05.760
- No, no, it's all right,

01:04:05.761 --> 01:04:06.758
it's my neighbor.

01:04:06.759 --> 01:04:07.760
I'll sort this out,

01:04:07.761 --> 01:04:08.758
it's fine.

01:04:08.758 --> 01:04:09.591
- You're sleeping with him.

01:04:09.592 --> 01:04:10.674
- Go outside.

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:14.214
- Next time you have an
epileptic seizure Martin,

01:04:14.215 --> 01:04:16.161
call a doctor.

01:04:16.162 --> 01:04:17.829
- Epileptic seizure?

01:04:24.288 --> 01:04:26.871
- You can't keep running to me.

01:04:27.847 --> 01:04:30.390
- Martin has epilepsy and he fits

01:04:30.391 --> 01:04:31.408
- You know, that's enough.

01:04:31.409 --> 01:04:34.909
That's twice with this flipping dork here.

01:04:38.006 --> 01:04:40.150
You, you've got issues.

01:04:40.151 --> 01:04:41.401
I'm going home.

01:04:43.009 --> 01:04:44.009
- Oh fuck.

01:04:46.807 --> 01:04:48.057
Go home Martin.

01:04:51.809 --> 01:04:53.476
- It's the password.

01:04:56.689 --> 01:04:57.687
Thank you Martin.

01:04:57.688 --> 01:05:00.230
You're welcome Alice.

01:05:00.231 --> 01:05:02.314
- Martin get out of here.

01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:21.293
- So, you finally won an award?

01:05:26.748 --> 01:05:28.267
- Finally?

01:05:28.268 --> 01:05:29.888
- Yeah, I mean.

01:05:29.889 --> 01:05:33.888
For how long have you
been in the industry?

01:05:33.889 --> 01:05:35.556
- Quite a long time.

01:05:38.908 --> 01:05:41.908
Hey, never too late to win an award.

01:05:42.848 --> 01:05:44.068
- Alice.

01:05:44.069 --> 01:05:45.152
- Ismael, hi.

01:05:51.588 --> 01:05:52.589
How are you?

01:05:52.590 --> 01:05:53.589
- Good, good.

01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:54.592
How are you?

01:05:54.593 --> 01:05:55.591
- Very well.

01:05:55.592 --> 01:05:56.592
Good to see you.

01:05:56.593 --> 01:05:57.591
- Good seeing you.

01:05:57.592 --> 01:06:00.388
- I think life is total craziness.

01:06:00.389 --> 01:06:02.351
It's like everything we perceive,

01:06:02.352 --> 01:06:03.852
none of it's real.

01:06:06.412 --> 01:06:09.030
How can we know what's true.

01:06:09.031 --> 01:06:10.031
We can't.

01:06:11.575 --> 01:06:13.851
You think you've woken up.

01:06:13.852 --> 01:06:17.126
I think you're in a deep sleep.

01:06:17.127 --> 01:06:18.625
- Great, thanks Alice.

01:06:18.626 --> 01:06:20.112
- Yes thank you.

01:06:20.113 --> 01:06:21.111
- I did mention to your agent

01:06:21.112 --> 01:06:23.014
that we're looking for
someone mid-twenties.

01:06:23.015 --> 01:06:24.432
Five years ago you would have

01:06:24.433 --> 01:06:25.431
been perfect for this role.

01:06:25.432 --> 01:06:29.181
But now you're just a
little bit more mature.

01:06:30.433 --> 01:06:31.691
Don't take offense Alice,

01:06:31.692 --> 01:06:33.390
I'm just trying to give you some advice.

01:06:33.391 --> 01:06:34.934
- I'm not taking offense.

01:06:34.935 --> 01:06:37.687
This audition is for a supporting role

01:06:37.688 --> 01:06:40.342
and I only audition for leads.

01:06:40.343 --> 01:06:42.386
So, I was giving you a chance.

01:06:42.387 --> 01:06:43.531
- Giving me a chance?

01:06:43.532 --> 01:06:45.115
- Yes Tom, goodbye.

01:07:05.152 --> 01:07:06.214
- Hi, you've reached Walter,

01:07:06.215 --> 01:07:07.548
leave a message.

01:07:09.111 --> 01:07:11.030
- Hi Walter, it's me.

01:07:11.031 --> 01:07:12.364
We need to talk.

01:07:13.361 --> 01:07:15.734
I'm sorry about what happened yesterday.

01:07:15.735 --> 01:07:18.832
My neighbor Martin's
parents are away on a cruise

01:07:18.833 --> 01:07:21.451
and they asked me to keep an eye on him.

01:07:21.452 --> 01:07:23.851
I must be too giving.

01:07:23.852 --> 01:07:26.588
Also, your father sent me on an audition

01:07:26.589 --> 01:07:28.172
and I got rejected.

01:07:29.687 --> 01:07:31.654
So, I'm not sure what happened there,

01:07:31.655 --> 01:07:34.155
but I really wanted that role.

01:07:35.251 --> 01:07:36.491
Give me a call when you get

01:07:36.492 --> 01:07:37.670
the message Walter.

01:07:37.671 --> 01:07:39.271
I've been trying to get you all afternoon.

01:07:39.272 --> 01:07:40.272
Okay, bye.

01:07:53.516 --> 01:07:54.516
- Hi Alice.

01:07:55.312 --> 01:07:58.352
- Could I speak to Walter please?

01:07:58.353 --> 01:07:59.353
- Sure.

01:08:00.657 --> 01:08:01.657
Walter?

01:08:06.691 --> 01:08:07.691
- Hey Alice.

01:08:08.893 --> 01:08:10.550
- Who's that?

01:08:10.551 --> 01:08:12.214
- This is Bridget,

01:08:12.215 --> 01:08:14.251
newest member of the Blackmore Agency.

01:08:14.252 --> 01:08:15.872
- What?

01:08:15.873 --> 01:08:17.611
- You have a problem with that?

01:08:17.612 --> 01:08:21.779
- Yes, I don't want my
competitors at my own agency.

01:08:23.334 --> 01:08:24.331
- You know what,

01:08:24.332 --> 01:08:25.830
it's not really your agency is it.

01:08:25.831 --> 01:08:28.413
Since you only own six percent.

01:08:29.831 --> 01:08:31.854
- Could I speak to Walter alone?

01:08:31.856 --> 01:08:32.856
- Sure.

01:08:35.296 --> 01:08:36.576
So that's it?

01:08:36.577 --> 01:08:38.198
It's over between us?

01:08:38.198 --> 01:08:40.095
- What exactly did we have?

01:08:40.095 --> 01:08:41.578
- Is this because of what happened

01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:43.499
last night with Martin?

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:46.198
- You need to get over yourself,

01:08:46.198 --> 01:08:47.948
because as if I care.

01:08:49.136 --> 01:08:51.616
- You just move right on to the next one.

01:08:51.617 --> 01:08:52.617
- Yeah.

01:08:53.576 --> 01:08:54.875
- You realize she is half your age,

01:08:54.876 --> 01:08:56.399
she's just using you to
get into the business.

01:08:56.401 --> 01:08:57.401
- And?

01:08:58.560 --> 01:08:59.644
- Disgusting.

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:03.558
- Women they use sex to get power

01:09:03.559 --> 01:09:05.920
and men they use power to get sex.

01:09:05.921 --> 01:09:07.738
That's how the game works.

01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:10.416
- Well maybe I don't like that game.

01:09:10.417 --> 01:09:11.417
- Hey Alice,

01:09:13.697 --> 01:09:16.947
good luck with your tiny little career.

01:10:37.882 --> 01:10:40.049
- I want to say I'm sorry.

01:10:40.903 --> 01:10:44.236
I was wrong and what I did was ignorant.

01:10:45.961 --> 01:10:47.984
I think what tends to happen is that we

01:10:47.985 --> 01:10:51.402
just see things from our own perspective.

01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:59.660
But you know what,

01:11:00.641 --> 01:11:02.808
now that I can see clearly

01:11:06.023 --> 01:11:10.190
I just really hope that
you can accept my apology.

01:11:25.999 --> 01:11:27.916
- That is so beautiful.

01:11:28.924 --> 01:11:29.924
Thank you.

01:11:40.561 --> 01:11:41.561
- Cut.

01:11:42.321 --> 01:11:43.321
Well done.

01:11:47.425 --> 01:11:50.258
- You know what, just do the work.

01:11:52.023 --> 01:11:53.883
- Alice, can I have a quick word

01:11:53.884 --> 01:11:55.217
with you please?

01:11:58.361 --> 01:12:02.521
Yeah so, there's no easy way to put this.

01:12:02.522 --> 01:12:06.018
But, it's not working out with your role

01:12:06.019 --> 01:12:08.186
and we have to let you go.

01:12:12.122 --> 01:12:14.239
- Anything else?

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.322
- I'm so sorry Alice.

01:12:15.323 --> 01:12:17.120
- You save me the faked empathy.

01:12:17.121 --> 01:12:18.742
- But Alice.

01:12:18.743 --> 01:12:20.944
- So that's it, you just kick me out?

01:12:20.945 --> 01:12:23.760
- I don't know what you're talking about.

01:12:23.761 --> 01:12:25.243
- You made big promises to me

01:12:25.244 --> 01:12:27.264
and none of them came true.

01:12:27.265 --> 01:12:29.160
- Alice, take a seat.

01:12:29.161 --> 01:12:30.924
- You found a younger model

01:12:30.925 --> 01:12:32.438
and you just push me aside?

01:12:32.439 --> 01:12:33.856
- Alice sit down.

01:12:39.218 --> 01:12:41.281
- Walter's laptop has been
missing since yesterday.

01:12:41.282 --> 01:12:43.740
I was wondering whether
maybe you knew where it is?

01:12:43.741 --> 01:12:46.074
- How the hell would I know?

01:12:48.301 --> 01:12:51.634
- Perhaps this will refresh your memory.

01:13:10.018 --> 01:13:12.518
- Can you tell me where it is?

01:13:20.539 --> 01:13:22.456
- I threw it in a lake.

01:13:28.599 --> 01:13:29.599
- I see.

01:13:30.839 --> 01:13:32.417
As I'm sure you can understand,

01:13:32.418 --> 01:13:35.918
we will have to report this to the police.

01:13:38.378 --> 01:13:39.378
- No, John.

01:13:40.938 --> 01:13:43.100
Please, you can't do that.

01:13:43.101 --> 01:13:45.034
If I have a criminal record,

01:13:45.035 --> 01:13:47.196
I could lose the custody of my child.

01:13:47.197 --> 01:13:48.758
Please Walter?

01:13:48.759 --> 01:13:50.059
I will buy you a new laptop.

01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:51.855
I will do whatever it takes.

01:13:51.856 --> 01:13:54.523
Please let me make it up to you.

01:13:55.698 --> 01:13:57.196
- All right.

01:13:57.197 --> 01:13:59.238
I'll make you a deal.

01:13:59.239 --> 01:14:01.356
If you don't want us to report this,

01:14:01.357 --> 01:14:03.715
you give us back the six percent stock

01:14:03.716 --> 01:14:05.299
and we pay you zip.

01:14:07.858 --> 01:14:11.236
Otherwise you can take the consequences.

01:14:11.237 --> 01:14:13.904
If you agree, you can sign here.

01:14:15.101 --> 01:14:16.601
Oh and by the way,

01:14:19.437 --> 01:14:22.520
you're fired from Blackmore Agencies.

01:14:46.472 --> 01:14:47.937
- Hi Mark.

01:14:47.938 --> 01:14:49.158
- Alice, it would have been a sign

01:14:49.159 --> 01:14:51.593
of respect to show up in court.

01:14:51.594 --> 01:14:53.036
- What?

01:14:53.037 --> 01:14:54.598
What do you mean?

01:14:54.599 --> 01:14:55.777
- You don't care about the custody

01:14:55.778 --> 01:14:57.913
of our own daughter?

01:14:57.914 --> 01:15:00.300
- I don't know what you're talking about.

01:15:00.301 --> 01:15:01.857
- You're a liar.

01:15:01.858 --> 01:15:02.860
Bullshit.

01:15:02.861 --> 01:15:05.036
You got a registered letter.

01:15:05.037 --> 01:15:08.358
- Mark, please I didn't receive anything.

01:15:08.359 --> 01:15:12.497
- Well, you can see our
child one weekend a month.

01:15:12.498 --> 01:15:14.977
You just think she's bothering you anyway.

01:15:14.978 --> 01:15:16.955
So well done Alice.

01:15:16.956 --> 01:15:18.380
Good mothering.

01:15:18.381 --> 01:15:19.381
You failed.

01:16:29.783 --> 01:16:32.200
- So, you had a good weekend?

01:16:33.819 --> 01:16:34.819
Good.

01:16:36.442 --> 01:16:38.775
- Why do you never visit me?

01:16:41.501 --> 01:16:44.334
- Oh sweetheart, it's complicated.

01:16:45.485 --> 01:16:46.485
- It's not.

01:16:47.861 --> 01:16:51.444
You have a car so you
can just drive to me.

01:16:53.661 --> 01:16:55.580
When I have an argument with a friend,

01:16:55.581 --> 01:16:58.831
you always tell me to talk and make up.

01:17:00.045 --> 01:17:01.212
Why don't you?

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.244
- Okay, I'm sorry.

01:17:05.245 --> 01:17:06.242
I promise I'm gonna come

01:17:06.243 --> 01:17:07.517
and see you more often.

01:17:07.518 --> 01:17:08.518
- Daddy.

01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:19.860
- Bye Alice.

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:33.019
- Somehow I have the feeling that you

01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:34.853
are not doing so well.

01:17:37.142 --> 01:17:38.741
- You're a bartender Paolo,

01:17:38.742 --> 01:17:40.325
not a psychologist.

01:17:41.436 --> 01:17:43.739
- Here, this one is on the house okay.

01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:45.040
Maybe it will help you to get away

01:17:45.041 --> 01:17:46.619
from your misery

01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:48.703
and feel a little better.

01:17:49.884 --> 01:17:51.217
Thank you Paolo.

01:17:56.662 --> 01:17:59.200
- Could you lend me some money?

01:17:59.201 --> 01:18:01.061
- Listen, I can give you free drinks.

01:18:01.062 --> 01:18:03.045
I can even put a mall on the tap.

01:18:03.046 --> 01:18:05.184
But lending you money, come on.

01:18:05.185 --> 01:18:08.768
I'm a bartender, not a charity foundation.

01:18:08.769 --> 01:18:11.168
- I'm a month late on my rent.

01:18:11.169 --> 01:18:14.267
The landlord wants to kick me out.

01:18:14.268 --> 01:18:15.685
- I have an idea.

01:18:22.385 --> 01:18:24.302
- You got to be joking.

01:18:28.288 --> 01:18:30.229
- That's what we're going to do.

01:18:30.230 --> 01:18:32.667
I'll lend you the money now

01:18:32.668 --> 01:18:35.085
and you start tomorrow at 10.

01:18:36.224 --> 01:18:37.787
- Oh Paolo.

01:18:37.788 --> 01:18:40.288
- Okay, let's make it 12 okay?

01:18:48.236 --> 01:18:49.459
- Are you going to make the decision

01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:51.460
or shall we flip a coin?

01:19:29.702 --> 01:19:31.483
- Good morning.

01:19:31.484 --> 01:19:33.882
- Oh, Paolo no, I can't.

01:19:33.883 --> 01:19:35.243
- Listen, go take a shower,

01:19:35.244 --> 01:19:36.363
put on this outfit

01:19:36.364 --> 01:19:38.443
and then we walk together.

01:19:38.444 --> 01:19:40.580
- I'm not gonna be a waitress.

01:19:40.581 --> 01:19:43.280
- You're going to act like one then.

01:19:43.281 --> 01:19:45.344
- Please Paolo!

01:19:45.345 --> 01:19:46.342
- Please?

01:19:46.343 --> 01:19:47.344
Shower.

01:19:47.345 --> 01:19:48.345
Chop Chop.

01:20:05.665 --> 01:20:07.206
- You writing a screenplay?

01:20:07.207 --> 01:20:09.483
- I am just writing down my dramas.

01:20:09.484 --> 01:20:11.344
- I think it's good to write down things,

01:20:11.345 --> 01:20:13.040
takes them out of your head.

01:20:13.041 --> 01:20:14.396
- Now it's officially down on paper

01:20:14.397 --> 01:20:16.624
how much I screwed up my life.

01:20:16.625 --> 01:20:19.540
- Oh come on Alice, don't be so negative.

01:20:19.541 --> 01:20:22.257
There are a lot of
positive things going on.

01:20:22.258 --> 01:20:24.261
You are young, you are
beautiful, you are healthy.

01:20:24.262 --> 01:20:26.523
And besides there is
this amazing bartender

01:20:26.524 --> 01:20:28.921
who just gave you a job so you can get

01:20:28.922 --> 01:20:31.280
your life back on track.

01:20:31.281 --> 01:20:34.948
- It's a drama Paulo,
not a science fiction.

01:20:44.439 --> 01:20:45.939
Tell me something.

01:20:48.945 --> 01:20:50.597
Why are you helping me?

01:20:50.598 --> 01:20:51.664
- Because a long time ago you

01:20:51.665 --> 01:20:54.740
sold me some great loafers.

01:20:54.741 --> 01:20:56.496
- Seriously.

01:20:56.497 --> 01:20:57.504
- Well you know.

01:20:57.505 --> 01:20:58.827
You've been in the movies,

01:20:58.828 --> 01:21:00.261
you've been on television

01:21:00.262 --> 01:21:04.012
and I thought maybe I
can enter the industry.

01:21:36.102 --> 01:21:37.867
- Hey Alice.

01:21:37.868 --> 01:21:38.960
- Hi.

01:21:38.961 --> 01:21:41.465
- Oh oh, somebody is in a foul mood today.

01:21:41.466 --> 01:21:43.728
- I haven't had enough
coffee yet for you Paolo.

01:21:43.729 --> 01:21:44.944
- You didn't sleep well?

01:21:44.945 --> 01:21:46.853
- I was working on my script.

01:21:46.854 --> 01:21:48.662
- Did you find out Who is Alice?

01:21:48.663 --> 01:21:50.384
- Alice is very tired and moody,

01:21:50.385 --> 01:21:52.848
so don't be too witty.

01:21:52.849 --> 01:21:55.387
- Listen, I just wanted
to tell you something.

01:21:55.388 --> 01:21:57.867
It's been nice to have you around

01:21:57.868 --> 01:21:59.184
in these couple of months.

01:21:59.185 --> 01:22:00.187
Really.

01:22:00.188 --> 01:22:02.165
After 12 O'clock you almost become

01:22:02.166 --> 01:22:03.904
a decent human being.

01:22:03.905 --> 01:22:04.905
Seriously.

01:22:06.487 --> 01:22:07.945
I want to ask you if you want

01:22:07.946 --> 01:22:10.306
to work for me full time.

01:22:10.307 --> 01:22:11.305
It would be an honor to have

01:22:11.306 --> 01:22:13.305
you around all the time.

01:22:15.367 --> 01:22:17.784
- Okay, do you Paolo Benazzo,

01:22:20.647 --> 01:22:24.390
take your lawful employee
Alice Richardson,

01:22:24.391 --> 01:22:27.419
do you covenant to love
her, to cherish her,

01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:30.800
and to give her a raise of 10 percent.

01:22:30.801 --> 01:22:31.919
- 10 percent?

01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:33.819
I give you five.

01:22:33.820 --> 01:22:35.462
- Oh, you want to toss a coin?

01:22:35.463 --> 01:22:37.142
- Okay that's good, you
mess with my accent.

01:22:37.143 --> 01:22:38.459
That's actually good for business.

01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:40.710
Seven, I'll give you seven.

01:22:42.823 --> 01:22:46.073
- I would have settled for five sucker.

01:22:48.916 --> 01:22:50.198
- What can I get you?

01:22:50.199 --> 01:22:51.201
- Alice?

01:22:51.202 --> 01:22:52.199
- Cally?

01:22:52.200 --> 01:22:53.478
- Oh my goodness, what a surprise.

01:22:53.479 --> 01:22:54.479
How are you?

01:22:55.740 --> 01:22:56.740
- Good, you?

01:22:57.639 --> 01:22:59.259
- I am good, thanks!

01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:02.059
- Oh sorry, this is Alice Richardson.

01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:03.681
- Linda, hi.

01:23:03.682 --> 01:23:05.099
- So, how's life?

01:23:07.202 --> 01:23:10.055
- I ruined my finances,
I ruined my career,

01:23:10.056 --> 01:23:11.622
I ruined my marriage,

01:23:11.623 --> 01:23:13.622
and now I only see my
child one weekend a month

01:23:13.623 --> 01:23:17.979
and I help out desperate
bartenders at 11 AM.

01:23:17.980 --> 01:23:19.897
- Do you want a coffee?

01:23:22.443 --> 01:23:24.022
- I hadn't realized the
security camera recorded

01:23:24.023 --> 01:23:26.123
the whole thing.

01:23:26.124 --> 01:23:27.121
So that's why they dropped me

01:23:27.122 --> 01:23:28.945
from Blackmore Agency.

01:23:28.946 --> 01:23:29.946
- Wow.

01:23:31.484 --> 01:23:33.062
- So, what happened to
your psycho neighbor.

01:23:33.063 --> 01:23:34.203
- Martin.

01:23:34.204 --> 01:23:35.921
Oh, his parents came
back from their cruise

01:23:35.922 --> 01:23:37.462
and moved to Scotland.

01:23:37.463 --> 01:23:39.244
So he had to find his own place to live.

01:23:39.245 --> 01:23:41.628
At least I haven't' got
somebody watching me 24/7.

01:23:41.629 --> 01:23:42.879
- What a shame.

01:23:44.421 --> 01:23:46.641
- I am writing a script.

01:23:46.642 --> 01:23:48.023
I haven't finished it yet.

01:23:48.024 --> 01:23:50.441
But would you read it for me?

01:23:51.544 --> 01:23:54.081
- Yes sure, I'd love too.

01:23:54.082 --> 01:23:55.260
- Great.

01:23:55.261 --> 01:23:58.844
I will get you another
coffee on the house.

01:24:03.325 --> 01:24:04.361
- Hi Alice.

01:24:04.362 --> 01:24:05.703
- Martin.

01:24:05.704 --> 01:24:07.721
- I am just collecting
the mail for my parents.

01:24:07.722 --> 01:24:09.121
The new owners keep it for us,

01:24:09.122 --> 01:24:11.201
and I pick it up.

01:24:11.202 --> 01:24:13.047
So how are you?

01:24:13.048 --> 01:24:14.029
- Yeah, good.

01:24:14.029 --> 01:24:15.029
- Me too.

01:24:16.008 --> 01:24:19.841
I'm not having as many
epileptic fits anymore.

01:24:20.808 --> 01:24:22.204
- So how is Anna?

01:24:22.205 --> 01:24:23.943
- She's good.

01:24:23.944 --> 01:24:25.847
She's coming to stay at the weekend.

01:24:25.848 --> 01:24:28.327
- Oh, well say hello from me.

01:24:28.328 --> 01:24:29.328
- I will.

01:24:30.205 --> 01:24:31.922
Bye Martin.

01:24:31.923 --> 01:24:33.506
- I miss you Alice.

01:24:34.888 --> 01:24:36.471
You really hurt me.

01:24:38.027 --> 01:24:39.482
- Martin, I was never looking

01:24:39.483 --> 01:24:41.816
for a relationship with you.

01:24:43.688 --> 01:24:44.967
You're a really nice guy,

01:24:44.968 --> 01:24:47.801
I just wasn't looking for romance.

01:24:50.408 --> 01:24:52.407
- You are so special to me.

01:24:52.408 --> 01:24:54.385
To Walter you are just a number.

01:24:54.386 --> 01:24:56.386
- Martin just let it be.

01:24:57.443 --> 01:24:59.943
- In fact, you were number 52.

01:25:03.469 --> 01:25:05.302
- What do you mean 52?

01:25:06.968 --> 01:25:09.400
- He recorded all his girlfriends.

01:25:09.401 --> 01:25:10.524
- Recorded?

01:25:10.525 --> 01:25:11.525
Like what?

01:25:12.747 --> 01:25:14.065
- Like when you press record

01:25:14.066 --> 01:25:16.149
and you record something.

01:25:17.585 --> 01:25:19.918
For example, in the bedroom.

01:25:22.429 --> 01:25:23.762
Sex tapes Alice.

01:25:25.469 --> 01:25:28.908
- He recorded all of his girlfriends?

01:25:28.909 --> 01:25:30.524
- Yep, 52 women!

01:25:30.525 --> 01:25:33.608
Well, 51, one turned out to be a guy.

01:25:35.149 --> 01:25:38.149
He didn't realize, but he found out.

01:25:39.346 --> 01:25:41.596
- And how do you know this?

01:25:42.605 --> 01:25:45.355
- I made a copy of his harddrive.

01:25:46.365 --> 01:25:48.448
- And where is that copy?

01:25:49.484 --> 01:25:50.651
- At my place.

01:25:52.749 --> 01:25:55.332
- Oh Martin, you are my savior.

01:26:01.506 --> 01:26:04.865
Did you see any pictures of me?

01:26:04.866 --> 01:26:06.866
- I didn't look at them.

01:26:08.328 --> 01:26:11.285
I'm not keen on swimming pools anyway.

01:26:11.286 --> 01:26:14.647
- Martin, what I want
you to do is to go home,

01:26:14.648 --> 01:26:19.244
get the tape and very
carefully bring it to me.

01:26:19.245 --> 01:26:20.385
Okay?

01:26:20.386 --> 01:26:22.544
- Okay, so, it's a date.

01:26:22.545 --> 01:26:24.295
- Just go and get it.

01:26:26.328 --> 01:26:27.328
Go on then.

01:26:36.267 --> 01:26:37.964
- John, Walter.

01:26:37.965 --> 01:26:40.905
I know we haven't seen
each other for a while,

01:26:40.906 --> 01:26:42.807
but I thought it would be nice

01:26:42.808 --> 01:26:45.102
to have a little chat.

01:26:45.103 --> 01:26:47.068
The last time I was here you asked me

01:26:47.069 --> 01:26:49.464
to return my six percent stocks.

01:26:49.465 --> 01:26:53.215
And you gave me absolutely
nothing in return.

01:26:54.546 --> 01:26:58.629
Now I'm here to kindly
ask you to give them back.

01:26:59.885 --> 01:27:03.552
- And what makes you
think we would do that?

01:27:07.308 --> 01:27:10.058
- 52 sex tapes recorded in secret

01:27:11.608 --> 01:27:14.275
by Walter of 52 different women.

01:27:15.848 --> 01:27:17.265
Oh, no sorry, 51.

01:27:19.389 --> 01:27:22.222
One of them turned out to be a he.

01:27:24.546 --> 01:27:26.188
- So what?

01:27:26.189 --> 01:27:29.468
- Now seeing as I have
absolutely no interest

01:27:29.469 --> 01:27:32.781
in owning a share in your company

01:27:32.782 --> 01:27:36.365
I will settle for the
return of my £54,000.

01:27:38.484 --> 01:27:39.984
Do we have a deal?

01:27:42.185 --> 01:27:43.185
- Do it dad.

01:27:46.589 --> 01:27:48.339
- You get your money.

01:27:51.528 --> 01:27:52.861
You utter moron.

01:28:00.685 --> 01:28:02.768
- Hey, someone once said,

01:28:04.827 --> 01:28:07.308
men use power to get sex

01:28:07.309 --> 01:28:09.844
and women use sex to get power.

01:28:09.845 --> 01:28:11.178
Funny, isn't it?

01:28:12.248 --> 01:28:13.581
It really works.

01:28:21.347 --> 01:28:24.347
- So John, still proud of your Dick?

01:28:26.130 --> 01:28:28.047
- Just get out of here.

01:28:42.312 --> 01:28:43.329
- Hi Bridget.

01:28:43.330 --> 01:28:44.331
- Hi.

01:28:44.332 --> 01:28:45.330
- How are things?

01:28:45.331 --> 01:28:46.951
- Good, a lot of work.

01:28:46.952 --> 01:28:48.252
Mostly features.

01:28:48.253 --> 01:28:49.409
- Wow, nice.

01:28:49.410 --> 01:28:50.929
- And I've been nominated twice.

01:28:50.930 --> 01:28:51.932
For Distant places?

01:28:51.933 --> 01:28:52.951
Have you seen it?

01:28:52.952 --> 01:28:54.748
- No, sorry.

01:28:54.749 --> 01:28:56.268
- It's with Gerard Mans.

01:28:56.269 --> 01:28:57.352
We're dating.

01:28:58.989 --> 01:29:00.666
I didn't see you on

01:29:00.667 --> 01:29:02.988
the list of nominees this year.

01:29:02.989 --> 01:29:05.308
- No, I've had a little change of career.

01:29:05.309 --> 01:29:07.452
- So what do you do?

01:29:07.453 --> 01:29:10.203
- I'm a waitress in the Red Lion.

01:29:11.352 --> 01:29:14.249
- Wow, I see you're really
planning your career.

01:29:14.250 --> 01:29:15.547
- Oh yeah, I'm planning it.

01:29:15.548 --> 01:29:18.048
I'm just planning it downhill.

01:29:22.089 --> 01:29:25.086
- Have you heard of John Lennon?

01:29:25.087 --> 01:29:26.828
- Is he an actor?

01:29:26.829 --> 01:29:28.746
- No, he was in a band.

01:29:29.947 --> 01:29:32.529
And he once said life is what

01:29:32.530 --> 01:29:36.311
happens when you're
busy making other plans.

01:29:36.312 --> 01:29:37.788
- Okay, and I suppose he thought

01:29:37.789 --> 01:29:39.645
that philosophy would make him a career?

01:29:39.646 --> 01:29:42.268
- I think he was pointing at

01:29:42.269 --> 01:29:44.471
the idea that whatever happens

01:29:44.472 --> 01:29:47.722
in life really is all out of our hands.

01:29:49.191 --> 01:29:52.608
- Especially if you end up as a waitress.

01:29:55.831 --> 01:29:57.664
- Let's just leave it.

01:30:05.037 --> 01:30:07.729
- It's good to see you too.

01:30:07.730 --> 01:30:08.967
Cally?

01:30:08.968 --> 01:30:10.968
- Hi Alice, have a seat.

01:30:14.148 --> 01:30:16.231
- What exactly am I auditioning for?

01:30:16.232 --> 01:30:18.899
I'm sorry I didn't get a script.

01:30:19.949 --> 01:30:22.028
- We want to talk about your script.

01:30:22.029 --> 01:30:23.809
- My script?

01:30:23.810 --> 01:30:24.967
- Yes, Who is Alice.

01:30:24.968 --> 01:30:26.049
We love it.

01:30:26.050 --> 01:30:27.287
It's powerful, dynamic,

01:30:27.288 --> 01:30:29.270
and the narrative is fantastic.

01:30:29.271 --> 01:30:31.489
It's really written well.

01:30:31.490 --> 01:30:32.490
- Thank you.

01:30:34.392 --> 01:30:37.325
But I still haven't finished the ending.

01:30:37.326 --> 01:30:39.326
- No, I love the ending.

01:30:40.488 --> 01:30:42.655
- How exactly does it end?

01:30:47.629 --> 01:30:49.148
- After you thank the director

01:30:49.149 --> 01:30:50.289
for offering you the role

01:30:50.290 --> 01:30:51.304
to play Alice,

01:30:51.305 --> 01:30:53.722
you go home singing out loud.

01:30:59.848 --> 01:31:00.967
- Mark?

01:31:00.968 --> 01:31:01.968
- Hi Alice.

01:31:03.749 --> 01:31:05.666
- What brings you here?

01:31:06.587 --> 01:31:08.609
- After the verdict,

01:31:08.610 --> 01:31:11.407
they congratulated me on winning.

01:31:11.408 --> 01:31:14.075
But to be honest, I feel I lost.

01:31:17.149 --> 01:31:18.149
- What?

01:31:20.392 --> 01:31:22.929
You got the house, you've got Anna.

01:31:22.930 --> 01:31:24.097
You want more?

01:31:26.168 --> 01:31:27.751
- Yeah, I want you.

01:31:33.352 --> 01:31:35.019
- That is so cheesy.

01:31:39.069 --> 01:31:40.247
- What?

01:31:40.248 --> 01:31:42.071
- That is such a cheesy ending.

01:31:42.072 --> 01:31:44.149
I would never write that.

01:31:44.150 --> 01:31:45.149
- I think it's good that you

01:31:45.150 --> 01:31:47.169
and Mark get back together in the end.

01:31:47.170 --> 01:31:48.265
- You think I'd go back to him just

01:31:48.266 --> 01:31:50.164
because he says I want you?

01:31:50.165 --> 01:31:53.748
No, he should at least
go down on one knee.

01:31:56.609 --> 01:31:58.887
- Alice, you mean the world to me.

01:31:58.888 --> 01:32:02.188
I've never met a more beautiful,
talented, spontaneous,

01:32:02.189 --> 01:32:05.689
humorous, intelligent, sexy lady than you.

01:32:07.789 --> 01:32:09.046
You know you're really amazing,

01:32:09.047 --> 01:32:11.467
and besides the fact that you're an

01:32:11.468 --> 01:32:12.461
award winning actress,

01:32:12.462 --> 01:32:13.741
you know you could be

01:32:13.742 --> 01:32:15.992
and should be a supermodel.

01:32:18.167 --> 01:32:19.804
- Sorry, don't you think that is

01:32:19.805 --> 01:32:21.859
a bit over the top?

01:32:21.860 --> 01:32:23.846
- Just kidding.

01:32:23.847 --> 01:32:25.126
- Kidding about what?

01:32:25.127 --> 01:32:26.683
- Oh, I was just explaining to Tom

01:32:26.684 --> 01:32:30.603
and Cally that an ending
like this would never happen.

01:32:30.604 --> 01:32:31.854
It's so cheesy.

01:32:32.924 --> 01:32:34.203
I mean, think about it.

01:32:34.204 --> 01:32:36.283
Throughout the film we have argued,

01:32:36.284 --> 01:32:38.322
we filed lawsuits,

01:32:38.323 --> 01:32:39.767
for the last part of the movie

01:32:39.768 --> 01:32:41.025
we hardly saw each other

01:32:41.026 --> 01:32:43.083
and now you've come back

01:32:43.084 --> 01:32:46.543
to make up to me so we
can have a happy ending.

01:32:46.544 --> 01:32:48.582
It makes no sense!

01:32:48.583 --> 01:32:49.983
- People love happy endings.

01:32:49.984 --> 01:32:52.785
- I know that everybody loves
the cliché Hollywood stuff,

01:32:52.786 --> 01:32:56.582
but real life doesn't work like that.

01:32:56.583 --> 01:32:58.646
And in a movie a character has

01:32:58.647 --> 01:33:00.625
to go through a change.

01:33:00.626 --> 01:33:02.203
- You did go through a change.

01:33:02.204 --> 01:33:03.643
You had your ego crushed,

01:33:03.644 --> 01:33:05.984
you became more humble, more open.

01:33:05.985 --> 01:33:08.166
Bust most importantly,

01:33:08.167 --> 01:33:11.167
it all happened in your imagination.

01:33:35.906 --> 01:33:38.073
- This feels so good Nina.

01:33:58.423 --> 01:34:02.246
- I love you, I don't
want to move to London.

01:34:02.247 --> 01:34:05.247
I want to be here with you and Anna.

01:34:07.207 --> 01:34:08.742
I love you.

01:34:08.743 --> 01:34:09.826
- I love you.

01:34:16.183 --> 01:34:18.183
- I need to go see Anna.

01:34:55.586 --> 01:34:57.253
- This is pure love.

01:34:58.567 --> 01:35:02.234
It's so beautiful that
they connected again.

01:35:04.546 --> 01:35:07.213
Because that is our true nature.

01:35:08.066 --> 01:35:09.066
Love.

01:35:12.087 --> 01:35:15.046
- Do you think Martin put
those naked picture online?

01:35:15.047 --> 01:35:19.047
- It's a movie Leo, there
are no naked pictures.

01:35:21.346 --> 01:35:23.013
- Hey, you sleeping?

01:35:24.626 --> 01:35:26.418
- Oh, is it over?

01:35:26.419 --> 01:35:27.643
Did I miss it?

01:35:27.644 --> 01:35:29.425
Did she win the award?

01:35:29.426 --> 01:35:31.862
- She won the award and
they got back together.

01:35:31.863 --> 01:35:33.260
- Who did?

01:35:33.261 --> 01:35:34.260
- Oh hello mate,

01:35:34.261 --> 01:35:36.182
Alice and Mark.

01:35:36.183 --> 01:35:37.183
- What?

01:35:38.924 --> 01:35:40.182
She left him and then in

01:35:40.183 --> 01:35:41.702
the end they get back together again.

01:35:41.703 --> 01:35:45.618
What is the whole point of this film?

01:35:45.619 --> 01:35:46.981
- It's about waking up

01:35:46.982 --> 01:35:48.742
from this dream that we live in.

01:35:48.743 --> 01:35:50.486
What we create in our thoughts,

01:35:50.487 --> 01:35:52.070
that's not reality.

01:35:53.047 --> 01:35:54.982
- No, that's not the message.

01:35:54.983 --> 01:35:57.222
What they showed is that you have

01:35:57.223 --> 01:35:58.566
to look out for women,

01:35:58.567 --> 01:36:00.923
because they use sex to get power.

01:36:00.924 --> 01:36:02.443
- Well, then they never try that on you,

01:36:02.444 --> 01:36:03.444
do they Leo?

01:36:07.303 --> 01:36:09.981
- Don't you get that message?

01:36:09.982 --> 01:36:12.006
- You should never eat
another woman's cake?

01:36:12.007 --> 01:36:13.404
- No.

01:36:13.405 --> 01:36:14.726
- Oh, you should always flip a coin

01:36:14.727 --> 01:36:16.785
when you've got a
difficult decision to make?

01:36:16.786 --> 01:36:18.865
- No, the coin is just there

01:36:18.866 --> 01:36:21.745
for you to be able to
understand your heart.

01:36:21.746 --> 01:36:23.300
You don't get that?

01:36:23.301 --> 01:36:24.726
- No I don't, but isn't that exactly

01:36:24.727 --> 01:36:26.945
how it's supposed to be?

01:36:26.946 --> 01:36:28.705
- So you do understand it!

01:36:28.706 --> 01:36:30.141
- I don't do anything,

01:36:30.142 --> 01:36:31.725
I'm just happening.

01:36:32.658 --> 01:36:33.663
- Oh wow,

01:36:33.664 --> 01:36:37.831
you have just finally figured
out who you really are.

01:36:42.349 --> 01:36:43.349
We are love.

01:36:47.106 --> 01:36:48.439
- Oh, bollocks.

01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:16.798
♫ I am you, you are me

01:37:16.799 --> 01:37:20.897
♫ Why is that such a mystery?

01:37:20.898 --> 01:37:24.798
♫ There is no separateness

01:37:24.799 --> 01:37:26.856
♫ There's no need,

01:37:26.857 --> 01:37:30.024
♫ No need to pretend.

01:37:31.997 --> 01:37:35.164
♫ Life goes on and on

01:37:38.762 --> 01:37:42.929
♫ In a universe where all is one.

01:37:47.297 --> 01:37:51.017
♫ For a moment I could see

01:37:51.018 --> 01:37:54.601
♫ I am you and you are me.

01:37:55.679 --> 01:37:58.929
♫ It's such a mystery.

01:38:03.940 --> 01:38:07.817
♫ Let it go, let it be.

01:38:07.818 --> 01:38:12.201
♫ Let it flow, nothing is real

01:38:12.202 --> 01:38:14.335
♫ In this world.

01:38:14.336 --> 01:38:16.315
♫ There's no end.

01:38:16.316 --> 01:38:18.078
♫ It's a play

01:38:18.079 --> 01:38:21.079
♫ An eternal dance.

01:38:22.522 --> 01:38:26.254
♫ What comes up goes down.

01:38:26.255 --> 01:38:30.422
♫ For a moment we just roam around.

01:38:35.780 --> 01:38:39.881
♫ For a moment I could see

01:38:39.882 --> 01:38:43.465
♫ I am you and you are me.

01:38:45.758 --> 01:38:49.008
♫ It's such a mystery.

01:38:50.042 --> 01:38:52.633
♫ Breathe in breathe out

01:38:52.634 --> 01:38:57.118
♫ That's the rhythm of our lives.

01:38:57.119 --> 01:38:59.286
♫ Move on

01:39:00.762 --> 01:39:04.512
♫ Fill the emptiness inside.

01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:09.043
♫ Wake up wake up wake up.

01:39:18.964 --> 01:39:23.203

♫ That all comes down.

01:39:35.162 --> 01:39:39.982
♫ When you wake up from this dream

01:39:39.983 --> 01:39:43.923
♫ And inner peace is found

01:39:43.924 --> 01:39:46.841
