00:05.216 --> 00:07.950
<i>Carrie... Carrie Bradshaw</i>
<i>from Castlebury, Connecticut.</i>

00:07.952 --> 00:09.051
I love you.

00:09.053 --> 00:11.387
There are so many soirees
now in the city.

00:11.389 --> 00:12.688
- I know.
- Do you?

00:12.690 --> 00:15.023
How's my article coming?

00:15.025 --> 00:18.026
Actually, I decided
not to finish the piece.

00:18.028 --> 00:19.294
You know what?
I just don't think

00:19.296 --> 00:20.529
it's gonna happen for you
right now,

00:20.531 --> 00:22.130
but be a love
and go make me a cappuccino.

00:22.132 --> 00:24.066
I'm pregnant.
Maggie, I'm engaged.

00:24.068 --> 00:25.300
What am I gonna do?

00:25.302 --> 00:26.969
We'll figure out what
your choices are... together.

00:26.971 --> 00:29.504
It appears your daughter
has an ectopic pregnancy.

00:29.506 --> 00:31.373
You are a lowlife,
getting my daughter pregnant,

00:31.375 --> 00:33.809
- putting her life at risk.
- Why didn't you tell Maggie's parents

00:33.811 --> 00:35.077
that you're not the father?

00:35.079 --> 00:36.878
She wouldn't want her parents,
especially her dad

00:36.880 --> 00:38.513
to know she was involved
with Simon.

00:38.515 --> 00:40.482
Do you not understand
what people will think of you?

00:40.484 --> 00:43.051
The only thing I care about
is that you know the truth.

01:29.432 --> 01:31.065
I knew this was a bad idea.

01:31.067 --> 01:32.734
I shouldn't have
come back to school.

01:32.736 --> 01:36.237
- Should've just told everyone I was sick...
- forever.

01:36.689 --> 01:38.923
You have
nothing to be ashamed of.

01:38.925 --> 01:41.225
You were out
with a burst appendix.

01:41.227 --> 01:43.260
At least that's
what I've been telling everyone.

01:43.262 --> 01:44.662
Thanks, Carrie.
But you know,

01:44.664 --> 01:46.564
half the town
knows that I was pregnant,

01:46.566 --> 01:48.432
and the other half thinks
that I was out

01:48.434 --> 01:50.668
because you beat me up
to get your boyfriend back.

01:50.670 --> 01:52.470
People just love a juicy story
so they don't have to think

01:52.472 --> 01:53.904
about their own boring lives.

01:53.906 --> 01:55.739
They'll forget about it
in a week

01:55.741 --> 01:57.508
when something else comes up.

01:57.510 --> 01:59.343
I don't know. I have
a terrible poker face.

01:59.345 --> 02:01.078
It's gonna be hard to hide
that this is

02:01.080 --> 02:02.780
one of <i>the</i> worst of my life.

02:02.782 --> 02:06.083
Whoo-hoo! Harvard!
I just got in!

02:06.085 --> 02:10.253
Early admissions. This is
the greatest day of my life.

02:10.256 --> 02:13.223
Yeah, I kick ass.

02:13.225 --> 02:16.193
Um, did you guys just hear me?

02:16.195 --> 02:19.630
I got into Harvard...
in Cambridge?

02:19.632 --> 02:21.432
- Congrats, Mouse.
- That's great, Mouse.

02:21.434 --> 02:22.599
Great.

02:22.601 --> 02:25.369
That's better.
Except Walt's not here.

02:25.371 --> 02:27.404
Way to ruin a perfect moment.

02:27.406 --> 02:29.573
Where the hell is he, anyway?

02:34.512 --> 02:37.314
What's going on?

02:39.183 --> 02:41.251
I've packed some things
for you.

02:43.788 --> 02:46.256
You told dad.

02:46.258 --> 02:48.091
It's something
he should know...

02:48.093 --> 02:49.626
about his son.

02:51.529 --> 02:52.729
Where is he?

02:52.731 --> 02:55.298
He doesn't want to see you.

02:57.935 --> 03:01.505
Can... we please
talk about this?

03:01.507 --> 03:05.342
Do you have any idea
what you've put us through?

03:05.344 --> 03:12.148
Don't make this any harder
than it already is, Walter.

03:25.930 --> 03:28.665
My parents kicked me out.

03:36.674 --> 03:39.175
- Hey, dad.
- Hi.

03:39.177 --> 03:41.611
I have something kinda major
to ask you.

03:41.613 --> 03:43.279
More major than when
you asked me

03:43.281 --> 03:44.814
to live in New York
last summer?

03:44.816 --> 03:46.849
Well, oddly enough,
it involves the person

03:46.851 --> 03:49.185
I was living with
in New York last summer...

03:49.187 --> 03:50.353
Walt.

03:50.355 --> 03:53.589
Um... you know
he would never be

03:53.591 --> 03:55.792
interested in me, right?

03:55.794 --> 03:57.727
Uh...

03:57.729 --> 04:01.097
Well, yeah. Yeah, I mean,
I-I, um,

04:01.099 --> 04:04.300
I probably wouldn't have
let you live with him

04:04.302 --> 04:07.036
if I hadn't known
that Walt was...

04:07.038 --> 04:12.775
Not interested in... in you
or... others like you.

04:12.777 --> 04:14.076
Well, he's in trouble.

04:14.078 --> 04:17.113
You see, his parents
found out that he's...

04:17.115 --> 04:20.315
not interested
in people like me,

04:20.317 --> 04:22.218
and they kicked him out.

04:22.220 --> 04:23.920
Is he doing all right?

04:23.922 --> 04:26.455
Not really.
Would you be?

04:26.807 --> 04:30.242
His own mother packed
all his stuff.

04:30.244 --> 04:33.712
What kind
of mother does that?

04:33.714 --> 04:37.049
Well, I was hoping
he could stay with us.

04:37.051 --> 04:38.951
Is that okay?

04:38.953 --> 04:43.455
Uh, well... Carrie, look,
I know that Walt is your friend,

04:43.457 --> 04:45.824
but I'm not so sure that

04:45.826 --> 04:47.726
we should be getting involved

04:47.728 --> 04:50.062
in someone else's
family problems.

04:50.064 --> 04:53.332
You know, dad,
you're the last person

04:53.334 --> 04:55.567
I expected
to have an issue with this,

04:55.569 --> 04:56.668
and another thing...

04:56.670 --> 04:59.805
it's not <i>someone else.</i>
It's Walt...

04:59.807 --> 05:02.341
one of my best friends
who you've known

05:02.343 --> 05:04.876
practically his whole life.

05:04.878 --> 05:07.012
Is it because he's gay?

05:07.014 --> 05:09.815
Because I would hate to think
that's why.

05:09.817 --> 05:14.052
I'll admit that it makes me
a little uncomfortable.

05:14.054 --> 05:16.888
I mean, I'm not sure I even
know someone who's gay.

05:16.890 --> 05:18.723
Well, you know Walt.

05:20.193 --> 05:21.793
You know what?

05:21.795 --> 05:23.762
Forget I even asked

05:23.764 --> 05:26.298
or that I told my friend
he could rely on me.

05:26.300 --> 05:28.433
I'm sure he'll be fine
living in his car.

05:32.098 --> 05:34.239
Carrie, stop.

05:40.980 --> 05:42.414
You're right.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.783
Of course he can stay.

05:46.252 --> 05:47.752
Really?

05:50.089 --> 05:51.990
Thanks, dad.

05:51.992 --> 05:55.160
Yeah.

06:00.566 --> 06:02.934
Thanks again, Mr. Bradshaw,
for letting me stay.

06:02.936 --> 06:05.470
Yeah, of course. No, I want you
to make yourself at home

06:05.472 --> 06:06.972
and enjoy your gay.

06:07.907 --> 06:09.574
I mean your <i>stay.</i>

06:09.576 --> 06:10.875
I should...

06:10.877 --> 06:14.913
Go and, uh, finish up
some... stuff.

06:16.115 --> 06:18.349
Your dad doesn't exactly
seem comfortable having me here.

06:18.351 --> 06:19.751
No, he's fine.

06:19.753 --> 06:22.020
'Cause I really don't want
to impose.

06:22.022 --> 06:23.988
- You're not imposing.
- Um, hello?

06:23.990 --> 06:25.256
That's easy for you to say.

06:25.258 --> 06:27.358
You're not the one being
made homeless in all this.

06:27.360 --> 06:30.528
You're not homeless, Dorrit.
Walt's the one who's homeless.

06:30.530 --> 06:31.963
So how come I'm being punished

06:31.965 --> 06:33.531
by getting kicked out
of my room?

06:33.533 --> 06:36.033
I don't have to stay
in your room.

06:36.201 --> 06:39.504
Ugh. Then your crap
will be all over the den.

06:39.506 --> 06:41.839
It's fine you're in my room.

06:41.841 --> 06:44.909
Are... those clothes dirty?
'Cause I could wash 'em for you.

06:44.911 --> 06:48.312
I like my clothes like this.

06:50.749 --> 06:52.150
Are you sure Walt's okay?

06:52.152 --> 06:54.152
I tried inviting him to come
stay with me in the city,

06:54.154 --> 06:55.620
but he said no.

06:55.622 --> 06:57.188
Should I be worried?

06:57.190 --> 06:58.523
I think he just wants
to keep his life

06:58.525 --> 07:00.358
as normal as possible
right now.

07:00.360 --> 07:03.694
So he's staying in school
and crashing with us.

07:03.696 --> 07:06.130
Well, I'm glad he's at least
with people who care about him.

07:06.132 --> 07:08.733
Honestly, I think he just
doesn't wanna seem like a mooch.

07:08.735 --> 07:10.735
Fantastic.
I'll see you there.

07:11.905 --> 07:14.572
Guess who's
gonna be a sexy elf?

07:14.574 --> 07:16.974
I just booked a job as one
of Santa's little helpers

07:16.976 --> 07:18.809
at a party for Bongo Jeans.

07:18.811 --> 07:20.077
I thought I told you,

07:20.079 --> 07:21.779
you can't use the phones here
for personal calls.

07:21.781 --> 07:23.080
Since when are you
such a goody-goody?

07:23.082 --> 07:24.615
It's making
my daily hangouts here

07:24.617 --> 07:25.783
so much less fun.

07:25.785 --> 07:27.885
You know it's not mandatory
that you come here.

07:27.887 --> 07:29.353
And I'm not being a goody-goody.

07:29.355 --> 07:30.621
I just wanna stop being

07:30.623 --> 07:33.224
Larissa's cappuccino-making
monkey

07:33.226 --> 07:35.659
and get her back to thinking
of me as a potential writer.

07:35.661 --> 07:37.928
Members of
the "Interview" -igentisia,

07:37.930 --> 07:40.397
in my office... now.

07:43.936 --> 07:46.670
I just came back
from my fall holiday...

07:46.672 --> 07:48.906
Uh, um...
what's it called?

07:48.908 --> 07:50.074
Thanksgiving?

07:50.076 --> 07:52.276
The one with the Turkey?

07:52.278 --> 07:55.713
Yes. Anyway,
I spent the whole time

07:55.715 --> 07:59.616
on the untamed frontier
of this beautiful country,

07:59.618 --> 08:03.087
experiencing
your wild, wild west

08:03.089 --> 08:05.689
in the town of Aspen.

08:05.691 --> 08:08.525
I've seen America...

08:08.527 --> 08:11.195
and it is...

08:11.197 --> 08:14.198
Denim. It's all about
Americana now, darlings.

08:14.200 --> 08:15.833
I want stories on the frontier.

08:15.835 --> 08:17.501
I want stories about cowboys.

08:17.503 --> 08:20.270
I want stories
about blue jeans. Go.

08:20.272 --> 08:23.307
And, Janet,
bring me a cappuccino.

08:26.311 --> 08:27.577
Did you see that?

08:27.579 --> 08:28.578
What?

08:28.580 --> 08:30.047
The ho-ho-hoedown
that is now Larissa?

08:30.049 --> 08:33.015
Well, that, and she didn't
ask me for a cappuccino.

08:33.018 --> 08:34.051
Poor Janet.

08:34.053 --> 08:36.086
You know what that means,
don't you?

08:36.087 --> 08:37.287
It means you're out
of the doghouse.

08:37.289 --> 08:38.355
You can pitch stories again.

08:38.357 --> 08:39.890
If I wanna get back
in her good graces,

08:39.892 --> 08:41.291
as well as published,

08:41.293 --> 08:44.861
all I have to do is find
a great Americana story.

08:46.798 --> 08:48.899
I think I have another shot
at a piece in the magazine

08:48.901 --> 08:52.402
if I can pitch the perfect
Americana story to Larissa,

08:52.404 --> 08:55.572
and I think I found one.
Bongo Jeans.

08:55.574 --> 08:57.073
Bongo Jeans? Really?

08:57.075 --> 08:59.142
Yeah. Uh,
it's an American brand.

08:59.144 --> 09:01.811
It's denim. I mean,
they're literally creating

09:01.813 --> 09:04.147
a new niche in fashion...
hip jeans.

09:04.149 --> 09:06.549
So it would combine
Larissa's two favorite things...

09:06.551 --> 09:07.717
commerce and fashion.

09:07.719 --> 09:09.886
If it came with a drink,
Larissa would marry it.

09:09.888 --> 09:11.254
Sounds pretty cool.

09:11.256 --> 09:12.522
Yeah, and it gets better.

09:12.524 --> 09:14.991
Samantha is working
the Bongo Jeans Holiday Party,

09:14.993 --> 09:17.394
so she can sneak me in.
Not exactly sure how.

09:17.396 --> 09:19.362
We haven't quite
figured that out yet.

09:19.364 --> 09:21.931
And then I need to think
of a way to introduce myself

09:21.933 --> 09:23.199
to the C.E.O....

09:23.201 --> 09:25.301
Carter something or other.

09:25.303 --> 09:28.338
- Carter Richman.
- Yeah. How'd you know?

09:28.340 --> 09:30.273
- Because I know him.
- What?

09:30.275 --> 09:31.608
He's an old golf buddy
of my dad's.

09:31.610 --> 09:33.443
We get invited
to all his parties.

09:33.445 --> 09:36.112
I know for a fact that my dad
already R.S.V.P.'d "Yes."

09:36.114 --> 09:39.015
So let me take you.
No need to go in the side door.

09:39.017 --> 09:42.285
Wait. So does this mean I'm
actually going to meet your dad?

09:42.287 --> 09:43.419
That's a big deal.

09:43.421 --> 09:45.822
Or not. He never really
shows up to these things.

09:45.824 --> 09:48.357
Even though he R.S.V.P.'d,
I think he's still in Laguna,

09:48.359 --> 09:50.326
which, trust me,
is for the best.

09:50.328 --> 09:51.327
You don't want my dad around

09:51.329 --> 09:52.695
if you're trying to get
an Interview.

09:52.697 --> 09:56.232
- But still, I'd be excited to meet him.
- Some other time.

09:56.234 --> 09:58.434
The Bongo party will be
about you getting your story.

09:58.436 --> 10:00.269
You sure?

10:00.271 --> 10:02.238
I'm gonna make this
happen for you.

10:02.240 --> 10:06.042
<i>It looked like my second chance</i>
<i>with Sebastian</i>

10:06.044 --> 10:09.745
<i>would be my second chance</i>
<i>with "Interview."</i>

10:13.770 --> 10:16.603
I love this tradition...
you and me, holiday shopping,

10:16.723 --> 10:18.790
the smell of Christmas
in the air.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.958
Oh. And too much perfume.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.995
I'm happy
to have you back, Mags.

10:23.997 --> 10:27.131
I'm happy to be back...
and to start over with you.

10:27.133 --> 10:28.399
Yeah. Clean slate.

10:30.303 --> 10:32.303
Oh.

10:32.305 --> 10:34.372
Hello. How are you?

10:34.374 --> 10:38.776
She's fine. Great, actually, no
thanks to you.

10:38.778 --> 10:41.345
Hi, girls.
I think we met before.

10:41.347 --> 10:42.613
- Yeah.
- Hi.

10:42.615 --> 10:44.849
You're Maggie, right?
The chief's daughter.

10:44.851 --> 10:48.619
Your dad would not believe what
a softie Simon is when it comes

10:48.621 --> 10:49.854
to Christmas shopping.

10:49.856 --> 10:52.723
He actually got my mom
an engraved picture frame.

10:52.725 --> 10:54.158
How sweet is that?

10:54.160 --> 10:55.359
That's adorable.

10:55.361 --> 10:57.228
Well, we should be going.

10:57.230 --> 11:00.264
These... these presents
aren't gonna buy themselves.

11:00.266 --> 11:02.099
Okay. Bye, girls.

11:02.101 --> 11:03.734
Good luck.

11:09.975 --> 11:12.409
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

11:17.016 --> 11:18.582
I hate that he gets to me.

11:18.584 --> 11:21.585
- Well, you almost died because of him.
- Yeah, and I'm sure he knows.

11:21.587 --> 11:24.829
My blabbermouth brother Joey
tells him everything.

11:24.949 --> 11:26.090
They're best buds.

11:27.692 --> 11:30.794
I can't believe he never
even checked in on me.

11:30.796 --> 11:32.529
Simon is not a good person.

11:32.531 --> 11:34.865
I don't care how many
picture frames he buys.

11:34.867 --> 11:38.402
Yeah, I know that.

11:38.404 --> 11:42.105
It still kills me
to see him with <i>her.</i>

11:42.107 --> 11:44.274
They're gonna have babies
together.

11:45.343 --> 11:46.443
After what I went through,

11:46.445 --> 11:50.280
I don't know if
I <i>can</i> have them, ever.

11:50.282 --> 11:54.051
You have to tell your dad
it was Simon.

11:54.053 --> 11:56.720
No, I'm scared to.

11:56.722 --> 11:58.789
He's already so disappointed
in me for getting pregnant.

11:58.791 --> 12:01.224
If I told him I seduced
one of his officers,

12:01.226 --> 12:02.225
it'd be even worse.

12:02.227 --> 12:04.027
You didn't seduce anyone.

12:04.029 --> 12:05.195
You're a teenager.

12:05.197 --> 12:07.597
Simon's an adult.
He's the bad guy here,

12:07.599 --> 12:09.533
which is ironic
since he's a cop

12:09.535 --> 12:12.536
and is supposed to
protect people, not hurt them.

12:12.538 --> 12:14.671
You have to tell
your dad, Mags.

12:14.673 --> 12:17.140
This will always haunt you
if you don't.

12:17.142 --> 12:19.609
<i>While Maggie debated whether</i>
<i>to give her father</i>

12:19.611 --> 12:21.044
<i>some upsetting news...</i>

12:21.046 --> 12:23.113
<i>Mouse was
still trying to figure out</i>

12:23.115 --> 12:26.249
<i>how to deliver her good news</i>
<i>to West.</i>

12:26.251 --> 12:28.585
- Hey!
- Welcome back!

12:28.587 --> 12:30.020
Great news!

12:30.022 --> 12:32.255
Really? So you heard?

12:32.257 --> 12:34.224
We won regionals.

12:34.226 --> 12:35.358
That's terrific!

12:35.360 --> 12:36.826
Any other good news?

12:36.828 --> 12:38.862
Well, this is my third time
winning regional championship,

12:38.864 --> 12:40.730
so I feel like I don't need
anything more than that.

12:40.732 --> 12:42.732
Maybe any college news?

12:42.734 --> 12:44.701
Is there something wrong, Mouse?
What's going on?

12:44.703 --> 12:46.035
No.

12:46.037 --> 12:47.437
No, it's just...

12:47.439 --> 12:49.606
I got into Harvard.

12:52.777 --> 12:53.877
Oh! That's amazing.

12:53.879 --> 12:55.745
I was waiting here for you
because I was hoping

12:55.747 --> 12:57.714
you were gonna tell me
that you got in, too,

12:57.716 --> 13:00.783
- so that we could celebrate together.
- Absolutely.

13:00.785 --> 13:02.518
So you did get in?

13:02.520 --> 13:03.586
No, I didn't get in.

13:03.588 --> 13:05.855
Oh. Maybe your mom
got the letter today,

13:05.857 --> 13:08.224
and it's waiting for you
at home right now.

13:08.226 --> 13:09.726
Mouse, listen to me.

13:09.728 --> 13:11.127
I didn't get in.

13:11.129 --> 13:13.429
But that's not gonna stop us
from celebrating your victory.

13:13.431 --> 13:15.465
Are you sure?
Are you okay?

13:15.467 --> 13:16.866
I'm fine.

13:16.868 --> 13:19.802
Let's focus on you.
This is your dream come true.

13:19.804 --> 13:24.640
Yes, it is. But I don't
wanna rub it in your face.

13:24.642 --> 13:26.375
I-I feel awful.

13:26.377 --> 13:28.578
Don't. I'm so proud of you.

13:28.580 --> 13:32.381
You're an amazing man!

13:32.383 --> 13:36.252
Trust me, this piece about Bongo
is the biggest thing

13:36.254 --> 13:39.536
that's going to happen to denim
since the California gold rush.

13:39.656 --> 13:40.412
I'm listening.

13:40.532 --> 13:42.958
Sort of. What I'm hearing
right now is you have ideas

13:42.960 --> 13:44.459
but not a plan.

13:44.461 --> 13:45.576
Can you actually get
to this man?

13:45.696 --> 13:46.752
My Interview with Carter Richman

13:46.872 --> 13:48.189
is already scheduled
in his calendar.

13:48.309 --> 13:49.917
- It's on the books, set in stone.
- Good.

13:50.001 --> 13:52.668
Because if you drop the story
again like you did with Weaver,

13:52.670 --> 13:55.771
you're done at "Interview."
I give second chances,

13:55.773 --> 13:56.839
but not third ones.

13:56.841 --> 13:59.808
Got it.

14:01.811 --> 14:03.946
Way to go, Carrie.

14:03.948 --> 14:05.848
I didn't know you scheduled
an Interview with the C.E.O.

14:05.850 --> 14:07.382
I didn't.
I totally lied.

14:07.384 --> 14:09.151
But I am going to go
to this party

14:09.153 --> 14:11.153
and figure out a way
to get to him,

14:11.155 --> 14:12.554
and if I fail, then I guess

14:12.556 --> 14:14.623
my career at "Interview"
is over.

14:16.326 --> 14:18.327
- Go big or go home?
- Exactly.

14:18.329 --> 14:21.296
- That sounds stressful.
- Yeah. You think?

14:21.298 --> 14:23.632
So how about you?
Any plans for tonight?

14:23.634 --> 14:24.633
No.

14:24.635 --> 14:25.934
Well, you wanna come
to the city

14:25.936 --> 14:27.369
with me and Sebastian?

14:27.371 --> 14:28.603
No. Thanks.

14:28.605 --> 14:29.971
I think I've done enough
Bradshaw intruding

14:29.973 --> 14:31.273
for one lifetime.

14:31.275 --> 14:33.108
You're not intruding.

14:33.110 --> 14:34.276
You are a welcome guest,

14:34.278 --> 14:36.678
and I know Dorrit hasn't
been the nicest, but...

14:36.680 --> 14:39.147
I love that
Dorrit's being so rude.

14:39.149 --> 14:40.482
It's Dorrit being Dorrit.

14:40.484 --> 14:42.818
She's treating me like
she always treated me,

14:42.820 --> 14:44.486
and that makes me feel normal.

14:44.488 --> 14:46.254
She's the one person
not making me feel

14:46.256 --> 14:49.124
like I'm walking around
on tiptoes in this house.

14:49.126 --> 14:50.959
Hey! I'm not.

14:52.296 --> 14:54.129
Well, that's Sebastian.

14:54.131 --> 14:57.232
You sure you don't
wanna come with us?

14:57.234 --> 14:58.366
At least to the city.

14:58.368 --> 14:59.734
I mean, we can
drop you off at Bennet's.

14:59.736 --> 15:02.337
And sit cramped
in the back of that Porsche?

15:02.339 --> 15:03.638
No. I'm good here.

15:03.640 --> 15:06.604
I just wanna lay low and
watch some TV.

15:06.724 --> 15:07.670
Okay.

15:10.012 --> 15:11.212
Have fun.

15:15.217 --> 15:17.452
Hey, you.

15:18.454 --> 15:20.989
I am so excited to chase down
this Interview

15:20.991 --> 15:23.658
with you at my side.
You're like my guy Friday.

15:23.660 --> 15:25.460
I'm excited you're excited.

15:25.462 --> 15:27.662
And, uh, I have some
good news and some bad news.

15:27.664 --> 15:29.497
I called Carter's office

15:29.499 --> 15:30.865
and told them
that I'm coming to the party

15:30.867 --> 15:32.467
<i>and</i> that I'm bringing
a journalist from "Interview"

15:32.469 --> 15:34.168
who's interested
in talking to him.

15:34.170 --> 15:35.203
Is that the bad news?

15:35.205 --> 15:36.604
Please tell me
that's the bad news,

15:36.606 --> 15:38.506
because that's
awesome bad news.

15:38.508 --> 15:40.608
My dad is gonna be there.

15:40.610 --> 15:42.176
Okay.

15:42.178 --> 15:44.178
And I didn't exactly
tell him we would be there.

15:44.180 --> 15:46.080
So I have no idea
how he's gonna react

15:46.082 --> 15:48.716
or... I can guess
he might react kinda badly,

15:48.718 --> 15:49.817
w-which means...

15:49.819 --> 15:51.853
That this night might be
an absolute disaster

15:51.855 --> 15:53.154
where you and your dad
come to blows,

15:53.156 --> 15:55.890
and my chance at a story
goes down the drain.

15:55.892 --> 15:57.391
It'll be okay.

16:00.630 --> 16:02.430
Okay.

16:16.172 --> 16:18.340
<i>♪ "Bah, humbug,"</i>
<i>no, that's too strong ♪</i>

16:18.342 --> 16:20.342
And if my dad's
drinking scotch,

16:20.344 --> 16:22.978
- he may get cranky.
-  - Okay.

16:22.980 --> 16:24.212
And there may be bimbos.

16:24.214 --> 16:26.214
- All right.
- And snide comments.

16:26.216 --> 16:28.583
Okay, now you're starting
to scare me.

16:28.585 --> 16:29.584
Scared is good.

16:29.586 --> 16:30.919
Scared is prepared.

16:30.921 --> 16:34.055
The only thing I wanna be
prepared for is my interview.

16:34.057 --> 16:35.457
<i>♪ Ski shoppin' ♪</i>

16:35.459 --> 16:36.825
Oh, look, there's Samantha.

16:36.827 --> 16:38.526
<i>♪ Had his number</i>
<i>but never the time ♪</i>

16:38.528 --> 16:41.763
And there's my dad. Looks like
he's already made a friend.

16:41.765 --> 16:43.164
Well, I'm just happy
it's not Samantha.

16:43.166 --> 16:45.367
That I am definitely
not prepared for.

16:45.369 --> 16:47.001
I don't want you to worry
about anything but your article.

16:47.003 --> 16:49.838
Okay? In terms of my dad,
I got this.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.706
But I wanna make
a good impression.

16:51.708 --> 16:53.041
You're not the one
I'm worried about.

16:53.043 --> 16:57.111
And here comes my dad.
12:00.

16:57.113 --> 17:00.381
I wasn't expecting
to see you here tonight.

17:01.684 --> 17:03.751
And you're smart
not to drink the scotch.

17:03.753 --> 17:06.988
It tastes like
warm... cat... urine.

17:07.924 --> 17:10.491
And who's this?
Uh, Mr. Kydd,

17:10.492 --> 17:12.827
I'm Carrie Bradshaw.

17:12.829 --> 17:14.095
My girlfriend, dad.

<i>so they're going to Hawaii...</i>

17:27.844 --> 17:30.244
- Hey, Walt.
- Hey, Mr. Bradshaw.

17:30.246 --> 17:31.479
Do you want the TV?

17:31.481 --> 17:33.681
No. No, no. I just, uh...
I just wanted to make sure

17:33.683 --> 17:35.116
everything was good with you.

17:35.118 --> 17:37.018
You, uh, settling in okay?

17:37.020 --> 17:38.286
Yeah. Great.

17:38.288 --> 17:40.121
Good. Good. Very good.

17:41.524 --> 17:43.224
It's just, it's Saturday night.

17:43.226 --> 17:45.793
I mean, wouldn't you...
Rather be out with your friends?

17:45.795 --> 17:48.796
No. I don't mind staying in.

17:48.798 --> 17:50.564
I brought over
some episodes I taped

17:50.566 --> 17:52.733
of my new favorite show,
"The Golden Girls."

17:52.735 --> 17:55.936
Ooh. Sounds interesting.
Just who are these golden girls?

17:55.938 --> 17:58.873
They're... just four ladies
who live in Miami together.

17:58.875 --> 18:01.142
And... solve crimes?

18:01.144 --> 18:03.577
<i>With</i>
<i>a 14-year-old in the house.</i>

18:03.579 --> 18:05.880
Actually... they sort of just
sit around eating cheesecake,

18:05.882 --> 18:07.381
talking about their lives.

18:07.383 --> 18:09.550
It's really funny.

18:09.552 --> 18:12.453
There's the ditzy one,
the fun one, the wise one,

18:12.455 --> 18:14.388
and the really old one.

18:14.390 --> 18:16.857
Uh...  Four women
who sit around

18:16.859 --> 18:19.326
talking about their lives?
That's a TV show?

18:19.328 --> 18:21.528
I don't see it lasting.

18:21.530 --> 18:23.530
You're probably
right, but I like it.

18:23.532 --> 18:25.065
<i>What ever</i>
<i>would we do with him</i>

18:25.067 --> 18:26.667
<i>- for two weeks?</i>
- Do you wanna watch with me?

18:26.669 --> 18:27.802
<i>There's plenty of things
to do down here.</i>

18:27.922 --> 18:28.821
Uh... sure.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.504
<i>We can take him</i>
<i>to Disney world,</i>

18:30.506 --> 18:33.407
<i>the Seaquarium,</i>
<i>the Everglades...</i>

18:33.409 --> 18:34.475
<i>Rambo.</i>

18:34.477 --> 18:36.410
<i>Rambo?</i>

18:36.412 --> 18:39.279
<i>The movie...</i>
<i>With Sly Stallone.</i>

18:39.281 --> 18:41.181

<i>You'll love it.</i>

18:41.183 --> 18:44.318
<i>He sweats like a pig,</i>
<i>and he doesn't put a shirt on.</i>

18:47.388 --> 18:51.124
Mouse, I can feel your eyes
boring through the menu.

18:51.126 --> 18:52.960
I just hope you're okay...

18:52.962 --> 18:55.996
About not getting
into Harvard.

18:55.998 --> 18:57.965
Why are you whispering?

18:57.967 --> 19:00.367
I don't want
anyone to overhear.

19:00.369 --> 19:01.335
It's no one's business.

19:01.337 --> 19:03.136
You should be able
to tell people

19:03.138 --> 19:04.838
in your own way
when you're ready.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.640
I don't have
a terminal illness, Mouse.

19:06.642 --> 19:08.008
It's just a college.

19:08.010 --> 19:09.242
A university.

19:09.244 --> 19:13.547
The most prestigious
in this country.

19:14.983 --> 19:16.917
And I know it has to bother you

19:16.919 --> 19:18.785
that I got in and you didn't.

19:18.787 --> 19:21.056
Mouse, I don't really wanna
talk about this anymore.

19:21.176 --> 19:23.957
- Okay?
- Okay, I get it.

19:24.926 --> 19:27.227
I just don't want you
to give up.

19:27.229 --> 19:29.596
There's still
regular admission.

19:29.598 --> 19:31.331
It's not over for you yet.

19:31.333 --> 19:34.267
Maybe I could talk to someone
now that I'm in.

19:34.269 --> 19:38.204
I didn't get into Harvard
because I didn't apply early.

19:38.206 --> 19:40.173
What?

19:40.175 --> 19:41.841
Why?

19:41.843 --> 19:43.643
Because last year,
that girl from Harvard

19:43.645 --> 19:44.778
told us they would probably

19:44.780 --> 19:46.813
only accept one student
from Castlebury.

19:46.815 --> 19:48.081
And if I had applied,

19:48.083 --> 19:50.617
I would have been the one
accepted, not you.

19:50.619 --> 19:52.886
That's not true.

19:52.888 --> 19:55.722
Please. We have the same grades,
same extracurricular.

19:55.724 --> 19:58.191
And then I'm an athlete,
I letter in three sports,

19:58.193 --> 20:00.760
have a single mom
and a brother in a wheelchair.

20:00.762 --> 20:01.928
It would have been me.

20:01.930 --> 20:03.296
And since I love you

20:03.298 --> 20:06.399
and I know that Harvard
is your lifelong dream,

20:06.401 --> 20:10.436
I bowed out.
So call off the pity party.

20:13.707 --> 20:15.274
You're welcome.

20:17.512 --> 20:19.746
<i>While Mouse</i>
<i>was learning a hard truth,</i>

20:19.748 --> 20:21.314
<i>so was Maggie's father.</i>

20:21.316 --> 20:22.482
I just didn't
want you thinking

20:22.484 --> 20:23.683
that Sebastian was the father.

20:23.685 --> 20:28.221
It wouldn't be right.

20:29.356 --> 20:32.758
I can't imagine
what you must think of me.

20:35.362 --> 20:36.462
Daddy, please!

20:36.464 --> 20:38.264
I could kill him.

20:41.669 --> 20:43.102
Did you say "him"?

20:43.104 --> 20:46.205
What kind of sicko
preys on a teenager?

20:46.207 --> 20:49.308
You're not mad at me?

20:49.310 --> 20:51.277
No, I'm angry at the bastard...

20:53.613 --> 20:55.481
And at myself.

20:55.483 --> 20:59.318
This is my fault.

20:59.320 --> 21:02.354
I-I'm your father.

21:02.356 --> 21:03.889
I'm supposed to be
protecting you,

21:03.891 --> 21:06.392
not leaving you vulnerable.

21:06.394 --> 21:08.127
Don't blame yourself, daddy.

21:08.129 --> 21:09.895
I'm sorry
this happened to you.

21:09.897 --> 21:13.766
Come here, come here.

21:13.768 --> 21:16.669
Oh, my little girl.

21:23.677 --> 21:26.345
I can't believe you got
to fly in the concorde.

21:26.347 --> 21:27.946
I've always wanted to do that.

21:27.948 --> 21:31.165
Do they really give you your own
eyeshades and slippers?

21:31.285 --> 21:32.299
That they do.

21:32.419 --> 21:35.187
Now that plane may be fast,
but it is not comfortable.

21:35.189 --> 21:36.321
The seats are tiny.

21:36.323 --> 21:38.290
But you get there in, what,
five hours?

21:38.292 --> 21:40.425
Mm. Hopefully someday
I get to fly in it,

21:40.427 --> 21:42.060
who knows?
Maybe for a story.

21:42.062 --> 21:44.329
She's a real go-getter
you've got here, Sebastian.

21:44.331 --> 21:46.465
Maybe she'll rub off
on you, huh?

21:46.467 --> 21:47.733
Yeah, maybe.

21:47.735 --> 21:49.601
So Sebastian tells me
that you're looking to get

21:49.603 --> 21:50.602
an Interview with Carter
tonight.

21:50.604 --> 21:52.704
Well, I-I was hoping
I could,

21:52.706 --> 21:54.706
- but I know it might...
- Let me get you a personal introduction.

21:54.708 --> 21:55.807
Really?

21:55.809 --> 21:57.876
That would be amazing,
Mr. Kydd.

21:57.878 --> 21:59.011
Oh, it's not a problem.

21:59.013 --> 22:00.837
And please, call me Garrett.

22:00.957 --> 22:03.248
Now... where is
that son of a bitch?

22:04.485 --> 22:06.918
Guess who just got
bango-ed in her Bongos?

22:06.920 --> 22:09.521
And in Santa's house no less.

22:09.523 --> 22:10.822
What? With who?

22:10.824 --> 22:12.724
Let me see, what was his name?

22:12.726 --> 22:14.860
Chris... Caleb?

22:14.862 --> 22:16.261
Carter!
Carter!

22:16.263 --> 22:18.430
Oh, no.

22:18.432 --> 22:21.132
- This could be bad.
-  - Garrett, you old dog.

22:21.134 --> 22:23.635
Hey. Look,
I want to introduce you.

22:23.637 --> 22:25.103
This is... please say she's
not your new girlfriend.

22:25.105 --> 22:26.104
She's a little young...

22:26.106 --> 22:28.006
- Even for you.
- No, don't be ridiculous.

22:28.008 --> 22:29.007
This is my son's girl.

22:29.009 --> 22:30.508
Come on. They're still
in high school.

22:30.510 --> 22:33.011
- You remember Sebastian.
- Of course.

22:33.131 --> 22:35.613
- And how do you all know Samantha?
- Don't worry.

22:35.615 --> 22:37.348
They don't know me
the way <i>you</i> know me.

22:37.350 --> 22:39.884
And Carrie's one of my girls.
I call her "Bambi."

22:39.886 --> 22:42.554
Carter, I wanted to introduce
you to Carrie Bradshaw.

22:42.556 --> 22:44.923
- You see...
- Wait, Carrie Bradshaw?

22:44.925 --> 22:46.658
- You're the "Interview" reporter?
- Yes.

22:46.660 --> 22:48.226
- Well, I-I...
- Hang on, I thought I was being interviewed

22:48.228 --> 22:49.561
by a real journalist,

22:49.563 --> 22:52.197
not a high school student
who hangs out with hostesses.

22:52.199 --> 22:53.464
I have investors
to think about,

22:53.466 --> 22:54.899
and who I give access to
matters.

22:56.936 --> 22:59.804
<i>Second chance?</i>

22:59.806 --> 23:03.241
<i>More like</i> fat <i>chance.</i>

23:07.151 --> 23:09.573
This is a disaster.
I should just leave.

23:11.388 --> 23:13.321
Look, he's distracted. I can
make a break for it.

23:13.323 --> 23:15.090
Carrie... calm down.
You can handle this.

23:15.092 --> 23:16.558
Can I? You heard him.

23:16.560 --> 23:18.460
He thinks I'm just
a high school student,

23:18.462 --> 23:20.095
not someone to take seriously.

23:20.097 --> 23:21.696
I'm pretty sure
when I was dragging you off,

23:21.698 --> 23:22.931
I heard him call me
"Bambi."

23:22.933 --> 23:24.866
Oh, he probably heard
Samantha call you that.

23:24.868 --> 23:26.801
This just keeps getting worse.

23:26.803 --> 23:29.504
Carrie, I've known Carter
all my life.

23:29.506 --> 23:30.572
He's a good guy...

23:30.574 --> 23:32.207
much more of a good guy
than my dad is.

23:32.209 --> 23:34.242
And you managed to charm
the hell out of Garret.

23:34.244 --> 23:35.744
Go talk to him.

23:35.746 --> 23:37.512
You're prepared.
He'll see that and be impressed.

23:37.514 --> 23:41.082
This is much different
than winning over your dad.

23:41.084 --> 23:42.684
I'm great with parents.

23:42.686 --> 23:44.552
I'm untested in the department

23:44.554 --> 23:46.588

fashion companies...

23:46.590 --> 23:47.822

23:47.824 --> 23:50.558
I'm best friends
with Trampy the Christmas elf.

23:50.560 --> 23:52.994
Don't worry about Samantha.
You are gonna kill this.

23:52.996 --> 23:54.929
He thinks I'm just a kid.

23:54.931 --> 23:57.198
You know Carter was 19
when he started this company?

23:57.200 --> 23:59.434
I know.
I did my research.

23:59.436 --> 24:01.836
Exactly. So you know
you can do this.

24:01.838 --> 24:04.005
- This is your second chance...
- And my last.

24:04.007 --> 24:06.708
If I blow this, it's over for me
at the magazine.

24:06.710 --> 24:07.709
Carrie, I get it.

24:07.711 --> 24:09.210
Going after what you want
is scary...

24:09.212 --> 24:10.645
And possibly heart-breaking.

24:10.647 --> 24:12.947
But if you don't go for it,
you'll have nothing but regrets.

24:12.949 --> 24:14.649
And I know that's not you.

24:14.651 --> 24:16.551
This is your chance.
You have to take it.

I'm kind of afraid to.

25:41.603 --> 25:43.636
Why?

25:46.040 --> 25:48.942
I guess seeing my parents' faces
and what they thought of me...

25:50.444 --> 25:52.245

about who I am...

25:52.247 --> 25:55.849
and what I'm doing.

25:55.851 --> 25:57.984
So maybe if I just don't do it,

25:57.986 --> 25:59.986

28:59.232 --> 29:02.133
Damn lucky you are to still
be drawing breath?

29:02.135 --> 29:04.402
You hand in your badge and gun,

29:04.404 --> 29:06.070
and do everything you can
to make sure

29:06.072 --> 29:08.873
I never see your face again.

29:08.875 --> 29:11.909
Get out.

29:21.320 --> 29:24.036
I'm so excited
and nervous.

29:24.156 --> 29:25.856
I stayed up late
and finished my article

29:25.858 --> 29:28.659
so my dad could drop it
on his way to work.

29:28.661 --> 29:30.927
Am I crazy, or are things
finally looking up

29:30.929 --> 29:33.063
- for all of us?
- Oh, you're crazy.

29:33.065 --> 29:34.798
But then
again, aren't we all?

29:34.800 --> 29:36.266
- Pretty much.
-  Where is she?!

29:38.504 --> 29:39.603
Where is she?!

29:39.605 --> 29:41.772
You little bitch!

29:41.774 --> 29:43.974
Oh, my God, this isn't happening.
It's okay. We're here.

29:43.976 --> 29:45.442
How could you do this to me?

29:45.444 --> 29:46.943
Your dad fired me,
and I got dumped

29:46.945 --> 29:48.211
all because you're just
a little slut

29:48.213 --> 29:49.379
who was <i>asking</i> for it!

29:49.381 --> 29:50.514
Don't you dare.

29:50.516 --> 29:51.815
You better get outta here.

29:51.817 --> 29:53.016
You're lucky
you're not in jail.

29:53.018 --> 29:54.184
What, let me guess,

29:54.186 --> 29:55.619
you told your little whore
of a friend

29:55.621 --> 29:56.820
that she should
tell her daddy on me.

29:56.822 --> 29:59.356
Was this your idea?
Don't get near them.

29:59.358 --> 30:01.057
What are you gonna do about it?

30:01.059 --> 30:02.592
Whoa.

30:02.594 --> 30:06.129
Pretty boy thinks
he can take me.

30:06.131 --> 30:07.797
Oh!

30:09.034 --> 30:10.767
No, stop!

30:10.769 --> 30:11.968
Stop it, you guys! Stop!

30:11.970 --> 30:13.837
Stop it!

30:17.809 --> 30:20.477
Sebastian, stop!

30:20.479 --> 30:21.644
Oh!

30:21.646 --> 30:23.213
You know the kind of hell
you put us through,

30:23.215 --> 30:24.814
you selfish bastard?

30:24.816 --> 30:26.449
Stop it.
I took the fall for this.

30:26.451 --> 30:27.517
Oh!

30:27.519 --> 30:29.719
- Hey, break it up!
-  Whoa. Whoa.

30:29.721 --> 30:34.591
Stop! Stop!
Stop. Calm down, okay?

30:45.770 --> 30:48.071
Not the best news.

30:48.073 --> 30:50.540
- I've been expelled.
- What?

30:50.542 --> 30:52.141
I don't get it.
Simon came here

30:52.143 --> 30:54.377
and started the fight.
Everyone saw that.

30:54.379 --> 30:55.745
Yeah, well, with my record,

30:55.747 --> 30:58.281
I guess this was the last straw.

30:58.283 --> 30:59.916
My dad is gonna <i>kill</i> me.

30:59.918 --> 31:01.984
No... he's not.

31:01.986 --> 31:05.021
He's... you're right.
He's gonna kill you.

31:05.023 --> 31:07.690
So the principal calls me.

31:07.692 --> 31:10.393
This is unbelievable.
This is unacceptable!

31:10.395 --> 31:13.329
Look, dad, I'm sorry. I... I-I...
<i>- You're</i> sorry?

31:13.331 --> 31:15.398
What are you sorry for?

31:15.400 --> 31:18.067
You're the only one
making any sense around here.

31:18.069 --> 31:20.770
Some scum cop harasses
a 17-year-old girl,

31:20.772 --> 31:22.838
and nobody does anything
about it except you.

31:22.840 --> 31:26.142
You stepped up,
did the right thing.

31:26.144 --> 31:28.644
I'm really glad
you feel that way, dad.

31:28.646 --> 31:29.845
Really glad.

31:29.847 --> 31:31.847
I bet you're proud
to be with a man

31:31.849 --> 31:33.582
who knows how to stand up
for what's right.

31:33.584 --> 31:35.317
I am... very.

31:35.319 --> 31:37.920
You know, I have always
hated these uptight,

31:37.922 --> 31:39.588
stuck up Connecticut types.

31:39.590 --> 31:41.991
It was your mother
who made us move here, you know?

31:41.993 --> 31:44.827
But now... we can get out
of this town for good.

31:44.829 --> 31:47.296
What do you mean?

31:47.298 --> 31:49.531
I mean, I've been wanting
to move to Laguna full-time.

31:49.533 --> 31:51.333
The only thing stopping me
was you being in school.

31:51.335 --> 31:53.202
But now that
that's apparently done,

31:53.204 --> 31:54.703
we can move to California.

31:54.705 --> 31:57.639
- Yeah, I don't know, dad.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

31:57.641 --> 31:59.641
Come on. There's surf,
there's sunshine,

31:59.643 --> 32:01.877
convertibles...

32:01.879 --> 32:03.011
Carrie can come visit.

32:03.013 --> 32:04.913
It's a done deal, Sebastian.

32:04.915 --> 32:07.049
You're coming.

32:24.167 --> 32:26.368
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:26.370 --> 32:27.903
Can I sit down?

32:27.905 --> 32:30.238
Sure.

32:35.778 --> 32:38.647
I just wanted to apologize.

32:38.649 --> 32:40.782
Really, I couldn't be happier
that you got into Harvard.

32:40.784 --> 32:43.251
And I never meant
for you to know

32:43.253 --> 32:46.655
that I didn't apply
so that you can get in.

32:46.657 --> 32:48.256
And yet you told me.

32:48.258 --> 32:50.392
You were just so patronizing.

32:50.394 --> 32:53.194
You were making all
these sad clucking noises

32:53.196 --> 32:54.996
and... and acting
like you were better than me.

32:54.998 --> 32:58.433
When clearly you think
you're better than me...

32:58.435 --> 32:59.834
and more qualified.

32:59.836 --> 33:04.639
I guess I just didn't care
about Harvard as much as you do.

33:04.641 --> 33:06.207
I'm not even sure
it's my first choice,

33:06.209 --> 33:08.443
so I thought
I'd give it to you.

33:08.445 --> 33:10.311
See...

33:10.313 --> 33:13.548
even saying it that way...

33:13.550 --> 33:15.450
If you weren't even sure
it was your first choice,

33:15.452 --> 33:18.086
then why didn't you
just tell me that...

33:18.088 --> 33:20.688
That you decided
not to apply early...

33:20.690 --> 33:23.524
Instead of making me feel
like you <i>gave</i> me Harvard?

33:23.526 --> 33:25.193
Because I did.

33:27.864 --> 33:29.497
Well, the fact that you felt

33:29.499 --> 33:32.834
I wouldn't be able
to get in on my own...

33:32.836 --> 33:36.070
only makes me think...

33:36.072 --> 33:38.740
you don't think
very highly of me.

33:38.742 --> 33:42.443
I don't know.

33:42.445 --> 33:44.746
Maybe I'm just tired
of your obsessiveness.

33:44.748 --> 33:46.380
It's in everything you do.

33:46.382 --> 33:49.317
Homecoming, our relationship,
getting into Harvard...

33:49.319 --> 33:51.252
it's just... too much.

33:51.254 --> 33:56.791
You used to think
my determination was cute.

34:00.562 --> 34:02.630
Do you not love me anymore?

34:02.632 --> 34:03.731
Maybe I'm just exhausted

34:03.733 --> 34:06.000
from your endless need
for competition...

34:07.436 --> 34:09.937
and I just don't care about
Harvard as much as you do.

34:09.938 --> 34:12.806
But you know I do.

34:12.809 --> 34:16.444
And now you've tainted that,
because now I'll always wonder

34:16.446 --> 34:18.978
if I got in
for the wrong reasons.

34:21.382 --> 34:22.650
I'm sorry, Mouse.

34:22.652 --> 34:25.252
Me, too.

34:27.155 --> 34:29.924
- I guess I should...
- Go?

34:29.926 --> 34:32.726
Yeah, I think you should.

34:38.099 --> 34:40.034
Merry Christmas.

34:40.036 --> 34:42.168
You, too.

34:48.777 --> 34:51.210
How can I do this...

34:51.213 --> 34:53.847
when we're finally back
together?

34:53.849 --> 34:56.884
How can I move
across the country now?

34:56.886 --> 34:58.519
How can you not?

34:58.521 --> 35:01.555
Things are finally good
between you and your dad.

35:01.557 --> 35:02.923
That's what
you've always wanted.

35:02.925 --> 35:06.226
But I also want you...
more than anything.

35:06.228 --> 35:08.495
We'll work it out.

35:08.497 --> 35:09.863
It's the modern age.

35:09.865 --> 35:12.900
There are phones and airplanes.

35:12.902 --> 35:15.335
We can write love letters
to each other.

35:15.337 --> 35:16.703
It'll be romantic.

35:16.705 --> 35:19.539
I'll be, like, your
Elizabeth Barrett Browning.

35:19.541 --> 35:22.442
Don't know who that is,
but I like how you're thinking.

35:22.444 --> 35:23.777
We can make long distance work.

35:23.779 --> 35:24.945
Of course we can.

35:24.947 --> 35:26.646
I'll fly back all the time.

35:26.648 --> 35:29.015
I'll fly back so much,
you'll get sick of me.

35:29.017 --> 35:30.383
You'll be thankful
to ship me back

35:30.385 --> 35:32.452
to a house 3,000 Miles away.

35:32.454 --> 35:34.387
I doubt that.

35:35.556 --> 35:37.224
When's your flight?

35:37.226 --> 35:39.559
In a few hours.

35:43.264 --> 35:45.966
Listen...

35:45.968 --> 35:47.567
I refuse to say "Good-bye,"

35:47.569 --> 35:49.269
because it's not good-bye.

35:49.271 --> 35:52.939
So let's just say something
casual, like...

35:52.941 --> 35:55.508
"See ya," or "Later, dude."

35:56.878 --> 35:58.912
I don't think I can call you
"Dude" with a straight face.

35:58.914 --> 36:02.015
Well, then,
how about <i>"Adios, chiquita"?</i>

36:02.017 --> 36:03.083
Mm.

36:03.085 --> 36:06.519
I like my first idea best...
"See ya."

36:06.521 --> 36:09.522
It's poetic in its simplicity.

36:21.969 --> 36:25.438
See ya, Bradshaw.

36:25.440 --> 36:29.309
See ya, Kydd.

36:40.924 --> 36:43.592
Dorrit, can you pass me
some more tinsel, please?

36:43.594 --> 36:46.662
You're, like, two steps away.
Get it yourself.

36:46.664 --> 36:47.997
Walt...

36:47.999 --> 36:50.399

37:01.312 --> 37:04.947
Carrie... Dorrit, um,
you guys have made me feel

37:04.949 --> 37:08.150
like a real part of the family.

37:08.152 --> 37:10.953

37:10.955 --> 37:12.721

37:12.723 --> 37:15.057

37:16.327 --> 37:18.494
has made me think of nothing else.

37:18.496 --> 37:20.229
I would love
some cheesecake, too.

37:20.231 --> 37:21.997
Uh, okay.

37:21.999 --> 37:23.699
I can run to the grocery

spending the holidays with you?

37:39.249 --> 37:41.516

could go to Junior's with you,

to pick up the cheesecake,

37:44.855 --> 37:46.822
well, you know...
that's okay, too.

Oh, Larissa.

40:13.602 --> 40:15.602
You sound about
as happy to hear from me

40:15.604 --> 40:18.539

- Sorry.

40:18.541 --> 40:20.807
I was just, um,
expecting someone else.

Buck up. I have a
<i>glorious</i> Christmas gift for you.

40:30.719 --> 40:33.387
