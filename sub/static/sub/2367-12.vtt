[coughing]

02:21.516 --> 02:22.726
[gasps]

02:25.062 --> 02:26.271
[sighs]

02:35.948 --> 02:37.115
[sighs]

02:48.794 --> 02:49.878
[clears throat]

02:49.962 --> 02:52.005
[gasps]

02:52.089 --> 02:55.342
It's a difficult thing, isn't it?

02:55.425 --> 02:57.177
Taking a life...

02:59.012 --> 03:01.765
feeling of the weight
and responsibility

03:01.849 --> 03:04.727
of all the years the person
you've murdered has lived...

03:05.728 --> 03:07.645
moments that they've cherished...

03:08.814 --> 03:12.359
the dreams that they've
struggled towards, gone...

03:15.528 --> 03:17.072
because of you.

03:20.408 --> 03:22.410
I want you to know something.

03:23.536 --> 03:26.832
Something important
that I've learned.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.919
That it gets easier...

03:32.504 --> 03:34.923
the more you do it.

03:35.007 --> 03:36.216
[screams]

03:42.139 --> 03:44.141
[theme music playing]

04:48.997 --> 04:51.416
[door unlocking]

05:11.979 --> 05:13.688
[breathes sharply]

05:36.461 --> 05:37.504
[floor creaking]

05:37.587 --> 05:40.632
-[gasps] Jesus.
-[Foggy] It's okay, it's just me...

05:40.715 --> 05:42.675
the dick.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.677
What are you doing here?

05:44.761 --> 05:46.763
Last I checked, it was my office.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.098
Yeah, yours and Matt's.

05:49.516 --> 05:52.310
Is that why you're creeping around
so late, to avoid him?

05:52.394 --> 05:53.728
Okay, first, there was no creep.

05:53.811 --> 05:56.481
You were just too whatever you were
looking out the window

05:56.564 --> 05:59.442
to realize I stepped out of my office.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.528
And have you been hitting the juice?

06:01.611 --> 06:03.196
Because you kind of smell
like a distillery.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.281
You're one to talk.

06:04.364 --> 06:07.450
I found you practically curled up
under the bar at Josie's.

06:07.534 --> 06:08.535
[Foggy] Fair enough.

06:08.618 --> 06:11.496
But that was the end of my night.
What happened to you after that?

06:12.747 --> 06:13.748
Nothing.

06:13.831 --> 06:17.377
That nothing include drinking and dancing?
Or just the drinking?

06:17.460 --> 06:19.504
Funny, you actually sound like you care.

06:19.587 --> 06:22.715
Karen, what's going on
with me and Matt...

06:22.799 --> 06:24.968
it sucks that it's bleeding over to you.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.844
It's the last thing
I'd ever want to happen.

06:28.513 --> 06:29.722
I know.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.267
Sorry, just, I, uh...

06:35.312 --> 06:37.689
Just had a...
a rough night.

06:37.772 --> 06:40.943
-You and I should not drink.
-[scoffs] Yeah.

06:41.026 --> 06:43.528
Yeah, I'm thinking about giving it up,
moving on to the hard stuff.

06:43.611 --> 06:46.739
-Narcotics? Deal me in.
-[Karen laughs]

06:46.823 --> 06:49.826
-You don't seem like the type.
-Yeah, I smoked a doobie once.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.203
Made me drool.

06:51.286 --> 06:54.206
-A doobie...
-Weed, pot, the Mary Jane.

06:54.289 --> 06:56.249
Whatever the kids
are calling it these days.

06:56.333 --> 06:59.252
I'm not sure that's, uh,
considered hard anymore.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.296
At least, not according
to Denver, anyway.

07:01.379 --> 07:03.756
The times they are a-changin'.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.302
Yeah.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.305
Yeah.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.309
So, you coming back to the office?

07:15.560 --> 07:18.438
I just needed to pick up a few things.

07:20.523 --> 07:21.733
Wait, Foggy.

07:21.816 --> 07:24.652
Let's not do this right now.
It's not a good time.

07:24.736 --> 07:25.903
Is it ever gonna be?

07:25.988 --> 07:27.948
[sighs] I don't know.

07:28.031 --> 07:29.324
That's not really an answer.

07:30.533 --> 07:31.826
Best one I got.

07:33.911 --> 07:35.705
Whatever's going on
between you and Matt,

07:35.788 --> 07:39.209
it would be really nice
not to be alone here, you know?

07:39.292 --> 07:42.837
I know. What you said
last night, you were right.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.007
No matter what's going on
between me and Matt...

07:45.090 --> 07:47.300
that doesn't change
anything with Fisk.

07:47.384 --> 07:48.593
I'm gonna keep digging.

07:48.676 --> 07:52.139
You can't just run around killing people
and call yourself a human being.

07:52.222 --> 07:56.018
He's gonna pay for what he's done,
just like you said.

07:56.101 --> 07:59.229
Do we still have a copy of all
that stuff Ben gave us, from the...

08:00.730 --> 08:02.274
the man in the mask?

08:04.401 --> 08:06.819
Yeah, uh, I think so.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.906
What are you gonna do with it?

08:09.990 --> 08:12.659
Honestly, I have no idea.

08:15.912 --> 08:19.207
So, you, uh... you don't think
the Mask is a terrorist anymore?

08:21.043 --> 08:23.253
I don't understand what he is.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.756
But no,
I don't think he's a terrorist.

08:28.300 --> 08:29.801
It's a start, I guess.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.888
Look, I know things are... weird.

08:35.473 --> 08:36.724
But I'm still around.

08:36.808 --> 08:38.726
You need me, just call.

08:40.728 --> 08:43.606
-You gonna pick up this time?
-Yeah, I'll pick up.

08:45.233 --> 08:48.611
Might not seem like it,
but everything's gonna be all right.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.031
How can you be sure?

08:51.948 --> 08:53.200
Because I have to be.

08:55.077 --> 08:58.621
Ease off the booze,
stay away from the Mary Jane.

09:00.082 --> 09:01.583
Will do.

09:24.021 --> 09:25.773
Well, that wasn't awkward.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.153
What are you doing here so late?

09:32.489 --> 09:34.949
-Or early or whatever it is?
-Um...

09:36.493 --> 09:37.994
couldn't sleep.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.331
Lot of that going around.

09:42.540 --> 09:45.210
Seems like it's the only thing
we still all have in common.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.588
I'm sorry, Karen.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.715
For which part?

09:53.468 --> 09:55.387
All of it, pretty much.

09:58.348 --> 09:59.432
You want coffee?

10:00.517 --> 10:01.976
Yeah, please.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.158
You know,
he thinks he got her killed...

10:16.241 --> 10:17.825
Elena.

10:17.909 --> 10:18.951
He didn't.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.454
You wanna try telling him that?

10:23.665 --> 10:24.957
Oh, right, that...

10:25.041 --> 10:27.335
that would be if you two
were still speaking to each other.

10:27.419 --> 10:29.587
It's his choice.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.301
Only if you let it be.

10:46.146 --> 10:49.149
You know, I'm starting to feel
like I made a mistake...

10:49.232 --> 10:50.983
coming to work here.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.279
-Do you want to leave?
-No.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.115
This is my home.

10:59.284 --> 11:02.954
You and Foggy, you're the only
good things in my life right now.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.540
Karen, did something happen?

11:11.629 --> 11:12.672
Yes.

11:19.304 --> 11:21.097
The world fell apart.

11:23.558 --> 11:24.767
Didn't you notice?

11:42.494 --> 11:44.579
[sighs deeply]

11:49.376 --> 11:50.585
[weakly] Wilson?

11:51.669 --> 11:53.087
[stammering] You...

11:54.589 --> 11:57.717
[stuttering] Don't speak.
I'll get the doctor.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.553
Why... why am...

12:00.637 --> 12:02.639
why am I here?

12:05.683 --> 12:07.394
It was the benefit.

12:07.477 --> 12:10.438
Something was in your drink.

12:10.522 --> 12:12.231
But it was my fault.

12:12.315 --> 12:14.859
I should have known,
the way things are,

12:14.942 --> 12:17.153
that someone would try to get to me.

12:18.321 --> 12:21.533
And I'm sorry.
You were caught in the middle.

12:22.659 --> 12:27.830
[laughs softly] Someone tries to kill you
and you're the one apologizing?

12:29.206 --> 12:32.669
You almost died, Vanessa,
because of me...

12:33.670 --> 12:36.088
because of who I am.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.965
I made arrangements.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.677
When you're able to be moved,
you'll be...

12:42.762 --> 12:44.931
taken out of the country.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.518
Are you coming with me?

12:52.314 --> 12:54.231
Then...

12:54.316 --> 12:57.652
I think I'll stay where I am.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.406
I need to keep you safe.

13:02.324 --> 13:05.577
Is that really all you need?

13:05.660 --> 13:07.412
I was being selfish...

13:09.331 --> 13:11.082
believing that I could have this...

13:11.165 --> 13:14.001
that there would be
no consequences.

13:14.085 --> 13:16.463
I knew being with you would be...

13:18.548 --> 13:19.966
complicated.
[chuckles]

13:21.217 --> 13:23.094
I made that choice.

13:24.679 --> 13:26.514
One I still make.

13:29.308 --> 13:33.896
Find who did this to us
and make them understand.

13:33.980 --> 13:36.148
Understand what?

13:37.525 --> 13:40.528
That they could never
take you away from me.

13:40.612 --> 13:42.279
-[sighs]
-[knocking on door]

13:42.364 --> 13:45.116
-[Francis] Sir?
-Not now.

13:45.199 --> 13:48.495
Go. Go.

13:48.578 --> 13:50.830
-No, it can wait.
-I'm still here.

13:52.415 --> 13:54.250
I'm not leaving.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.754
I'll make them suffer
for what they've done.

13:57.837 --> 14:01.007
I expect nothing less.

14:10.767 --> 14:13.060
-Sorry, sir.
-What is it?

14:14.103 --> 14:15.438
They've located him.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.483
And where is he?

14:22.194 --> 14:23.905
[man] Sir, excuse me, stop.
I can't let you go in--

14:23.988 --> 14:27.367
[Leland] Get your hands off me, moron.
He called me.

14:27.450 --> 14:28.785
[Leland sighs]

14:30.077 --> 14:31.704
Oh, shit.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.458
[Fisk] Look what they did, Leland.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.127
Look what they did to him.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.296
What happened?

14:40.380 --> 14:44.133
He got a call last night
at the hospital.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.719
-[Leland] From who?
-I don't know.

14:46.803 --> 14:49.389
He asked for the keys
to the SUV and my gun.

14:51.182 --> 14:52.517
[Fisk] And you let him leave?

14:53.267 --> 14:54.644
Alone?

14:57.730 --> 14:59.982
He ordered me to stay.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.777
He wanted as many men
on you as possible.

15:08.365 --> 15:10.452
-[Francis groaning]
-[Leland] Whoa, Wilson!

15:12.704 --> 15:14.205
-Wilson!
-He's my friend!

15:14.288 --> 15:16.332
He's... my... friend!

15:16.416 --> 15:20.545
May... maybe this isn't the best time
to be beating your men to death.

15:20.628 --> 15:23.965
He... he did what he was told.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.551
I think they call that loyalty,
or something.

15:28.219 --> 15:29.596
[breathing heavily]

15:40.773 --> 15:42.108
[muttering]

15:43.443 --> 15:45.695
Clean him up.

15:59.250 --> 16:02.629
[Leland] First, the attack
at the benefit, now this?

16:02.712 --> 16:04.005
[Leland sighs]

16:04.088 --> 16:06.549
Somebody's not happy.

16:06.633 --> 16:09.927
Nobu's accounts...
are they still active?

16:10.011 --> 16:14.056
Yeah, but nothing's been touched
since he went up in smoke.

16:14.140 --> 16:17.477
-And Gao?
-You think this is her?

16:17.560 --> 16:20.647
No, my money's on the Japanese.

16:21.731 --> 16:25.401
Maybe they found out about
your little bonfire with their boss.

16:28.029 --> 16:30.031
You can go now, Leland.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.240
Okay.

16:33.075 --> 16:37.497
But... whatever war
you're thinking about starting...

16:38.915 --> 16:40.708
don't lose sight of the end game.

16:40.792 --> 16:45.171
Once Senator Cherryh has cleared
the last of the zoning issues,

16:45.254 --> 16:47.256
you can tear down
the rest of Hell's Kitchen

16:47.339 --> 16:50.342
and build your better tomorrow.

16:53.555 --> 16:56.933
It's a shame not everybody'll
be there to see it, but...

16:58.768 --> 16:59.936
shit happens.

17:04.481 --> 17:06.317
Find out who did this to...

17:08.110 --> 17:10.362
to Vanessa and to Wesley.

17:10.446 --> 17:12.281
[Leland] I'll see what I can shake loose.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.201
Just remember, uh...

17:16.786 --> 17:20.915
wind blows the hardest
the closer you get to the mountaintop.

17:23.835 --> 17:26.295
[sighs]

17:34.804 --> 17:36.305
[breathes deeply]

17:42.103 --> 17:43.312
[sighs]

18:24.896 --> 18:26.355
[grunts]

18:28.816 --> 18:30.777
You like making an entrance,
don't you?

18:34.739 --> 18:36.699
-I need information.
-Yeah?

18:36.783 --> 18:40.077
Haven't heard anything about a man
in a mask beating on bad guys lately.

18:40.161 --> 18:41.495
Thought maybe you'd quit on us.

18:42.664 --> 18:43.706
I'm still here.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.418
Somebody get a piece of you?

18:48.252 --> 18:50.171
We went the distance,
it's all that matters.

18:50.254 --> 18:53.215
"Went the distance," huh?
Sound like a boxer.

18:53.299 --> 18:55.592
[chuckles]
Always a reporter.

18:55.677 --> 18:57.637
Hey, it's what I do.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.640
Why I'm here.

19:00.723 --> 19:03.685
[Ben] Yeah, I've seen this around...

19:03.768 --> 19:05.937
all over the city.

19:06.020 --> 19:08.731
Heroin, pure like you've never seen.

19:09.857 --> 19:11.776
Call it "Steel Serpent" on the streets.

19:11.859 --> 19:14.236
The man I took that off of
murdered Elena Cardenas.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.321
Yeah, I heard about that.

19:15.404 --> 19:16.656
He was working for Fisk.

19:16.739 --> 19:18.490
Vladimir Ranskahov,
before he died,

19:18.574 --> 19:20.993
he said Fisk arranged access
to the Chinese and their drugs.

19:21.077 --> 19:24.455
-Russians got wiped out.
-I'm not interested in the Russians.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.749
You're thinking about
making a move on the triads now?

19:26.833 --> 19:28.835
-Russians were distribution, right?
-That's what I hear.

19:28.918 --> 19:31.462
With them out the way, there's an
awful lot of money lying on the table.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.380
You think Fisk picked up distribution?

19:34.381 --> 19:36.258
Like I said, a lot of money.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.887
And I'm guessing
tearing down Hell's Kitchen isn't cheap.

19:40.930 --> 19:43.224
Interrupting the cash flow may...
slow him down.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.017
Doubt if it'll stop him.

19:45.101 --> 19:46.227
No...

19:47.561 --> 19:49.731
but it might knock him off balance.

19:49.814 --> 19:53.442
Get him mad, maybe enough to
make a mistake big enough to matter.

19:54.902 --> 19:59.323
I got something I'm working on, might help
push that bald prick over the edge.

19:59.406 --> 20:02.994
No, I want you to keep your head down,
until this is over.

20:03.077 --> 20:05.204
My head's fine where it's at.

20:05.287 --> 20:06.580
Oh, yeah?

20:06.663 --> 20:08.791
Vladimir's brother
probably thought the same.

20:11.252 --> 20:13.004
Point taken.

20:13.087 --> 20:15.381
The Chinese,
who's the man at the top?

20:15.464 --> 20:18.634
Isn't one, it's a woman.
Never got her name.

20:18.718 --> 20:22.346
-Any idea where I can find her?
-If I did, it'd be on the front page.

20:22.429 --> 20:25.016
The Russian that Blake shot
in interrogation,

20:25.099 --> 20:27.810
there was a Chinese man
in the back of his cab in an alley.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.186
Blind, carried a backpack.

20:29.270 --> 20:32.815
I've seen those guys around town.
Drugs in the pack?

20:33.775 --> 20:35.109
Little busy to check.

20:36.027 --> 20:39.864
Would make sense.
Nobody'd look at a blind man twice.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.742
No, they wouldn't.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.162
You said you've seen them around.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.371
Where?

20:48.330 --> 20:49.498
51st and 9th.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.000
No...

20:51.083 --> 20:52.919
10th.
51st and 10th.

20:53.002 --> 20:54.711
But that was a while back.

20:54.796 --> 20:56.672
I'll see what I can find.

20:56.756 --> 20:59.050
It was during the day,
morning rush hour.

20:59.133 --> 21:02.719
-Guy like you might stick out.
-I'll dress down.

21:02.804 --> 21:03.846
[chuckles]

21:03.930 --> 21:06.140
It's cold, you should
get yourself a better coat.

21:07.141 --> 21:08.642
How about you get
yourself a better outfit,

21:08.725 --> 21:11.020
you gonna keep running
around out there?

21:11.103 --> 21:12.188
I'm working on it.

21:14.231 --> 21:15.942
Watch your back, Ben.

21:16.025 --> 21:19.486
Fisk is an animal...
and we're backing him into a corner.

21:29.872 --> 21:32.416
Hey, sorry.
Couldn't flag a cab.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.711
You know that buffalo wouldn't
make me a vodka martini?

21:35.795 --> 21:38.339
I had to settle for just vodka.
[sniffs] Hmm.

21:38.422 --> 21:41.508
Oh, yeah, she can be, um...
You gotta ask nice.

21:41.592 --> 21:43.803
I pay nice.
[whispers] That should be enough.

21:43.886 --> 21:45.596
You want a martini?
I'll get you a martini.

21:45.679 --> 21:48.724
What I want is to not be in this
petri dish a second longer than I have to.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.101
Why are we meeting here?

21:51.518 --> 21:53.896
[sighs]
I need your help.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.647
My help?

21:55.731 --> 21:56.858
Yeah.

21:57.524 --> 22:00.152
That's disappointing,
I thought this was a booty call.

22:00.236 --> 22:01.445
[laughs]

22:01.528 --> 22:04.866
You remember the tenement case,
that I came to Landman and Zack about?

22:04.949 --> 22:06.242
Yeah, Mrs. Cardenas.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.744
Thought you were gonna say
"Carnitas" again.

22:08.828 --> 22:11.747
I'm not a complete asshole.
I heard about what happened to her.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.374
Yeah, but that's only half the story.

22:13.457 --> 22:15.584
Her tenement was just
one building that was targeted.

22:15.667 --> 22:18.004
There's dozens of others across
Hell's Kitchen, maybe hundreds.

22:18.087 --> 22:19.796
Targeted by who?

22:21.924 --> 22:23.009
[whispers] Wilson Fisk.

22:24.551 --> 22:26.971
-Okay, I gotta go.
-Wait, just wait a second.

22:27.054 --> 22:29.223
We represent Fisk.
I can't talk to you about this.

22:29.306 --> 22:31.058
Then don't talk, just...

22:34.228 --> 22:35.646
read.

22:35.729 --> 22:37.982
Five minutes, please.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.234
Five minutes.

22:40.317 --> 22:42.444
And only because you were actually
really good the other night.

22:50.702 --> 22:52.079
[floor creaking]

22:53.455 --> 22:55.124
Everybody's gotta be
sneaking around tonight?

22:55.207 --> 22:56.500
What the hell are you doing?

22:56.583 --> 22:58.961
Why haven't you published the story
about what Fisk did to his father?

22:59.045 --> 23:01.838
-I told you, I'd think about it.
-It needs to be out there, Ben.

23:01.923 --> 23:03.257
Can we talk about this tomorrow?

23:03.340 --> 23:05.009
I think they know...

23:06.427 --> 23:08.429
that we found his mother.

23:10.222 --> 23:13.309
I think they know, Ben.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.521
Been trying to find a second source.

23:17.604 --> 23:21.067
There's a guy...
who knew Rigoletto back in the day...

23:22.484 --> 23:24.111
relocated to Florida.

23:24.195 --> 23:26.155
Just waiting to hear back.

23:26.238 --> 23:30.159
What does that have to do with...
It isn't about who he owed money to.

23:30.242 --> 23:31.368
It's a connection.

23:31.452 --> 23:34.496
Bill Fisk owed money to Rigoletto.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.832
My source remembers
anything about that,

23:36.915 --> 23:39.335
it's a piece of her story
we can prove.

23:39.418 --> 23:40.419
From there--

23:40.502 --> 23:43.965
There isn't going to be a "from there"
if we don't do something... right now.

23:44.048 --> 23:46.092
I work for a newspaper, Karen.

23:46.175 --> 23:49.886
Not some Internet blog where
the facts are whatever you make up.

23:49.971 --> 23:51.263
Yeah.

23:52.473 --> 23:54.016
[Ben sighs]

23:58.145 --> 24:02.441
You said you think they might know
that we went out to Saint Benezet.

24:02.524 --> 24:03.692
How?

24:06.028 --> 24:07.779
It's just a feeling.

24:10.032 --> 24:13.285
Yeah, had plenty of those
over the years.

24:13.369 --> 24:15.371
Sometimes they were right,
sometimes not.

24:15.454 --> 24:18.832
No, you have to trust me on this, Ben.

24:18.915 --> 24:21.585
We need that story out there
before it is too late.

24:21.668 --> 24:25.047
Could always...
post it yourself on the Net.

24:25.131 --> 24:27.341
-Don't need me.
-[scoffs]

24:27.424 --> 24:30.636
And who'll believe me
when they start digging?

24:30.719 --> 24:32.179
When they find...

24:34.223 --> 24:35.766
what you found...

24:37.309 --> 24:39.103
when you were looking into me.

24:47.653 --> 24:50.322
I'll see if I can shake loose
any other sources.

24:51.573 --> 24:54.035
Write up what I've got tomorrow,
give it to my editor.

24:54.118 --> 24:55.452
See what happens.

24:56.537 --> 24:59.123
Thank you. Thank you.

25:02.751 --> 25:04.961
[Foggy] That was longer
than five minutes.

25:05.046 --> 25:06.463
Where did you get all this?

25:07.381 --> 25:10.176
Some of it Matt and I turned up
working the tenement case.

25:10.259 --> 25:11.593
And the rest of it?

25:12.719 --> 25:14.180
[sighs]

25:14.263 --> 25:15.639
The Devil of Hell's Kitchen.

25:17.224 --> 25:19.435
You're working with that prick
that blew up half the city?

25:19.518 --> 25:21.103
You read what's in there.
He didn't do it.

25:21.187 --> 25:22.646
-It was your client.
-[scoffs]

25:22.729 --> 25:25.774
My client has been all over
the news trying to help this city.

25:25.857 --> 25:29.278
So, there's nothing that's been
going on at Landman and Zack?

25:29.361 --> 25:32.198
Nothing that doesn't feel right
with Fisk?

25:34.741 --> 25:39.121
Fisk is one of our most billable clients,
along with Owlsley at Silver and Brent.

25:39.205 --> 25:41.665
You know, I could lose my job
just sitting here.

25:41.748 --> 25:43.417
Maybe even get disbarred.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.794
You didn't answer the question.

25:47.588 --> 25:48.755
Remember what I said

25:48.839 --> 25:51.300
when I came in into Landman and Zack
to discuss the case?

25:53.260 --> 25:54.928
About how you used to have a soul?

25:55.011 --> 25:58.307
-[scoffs]
-That wasn't just a jab, Marci.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.933
I remember how much you cared.

26:00.016 --> 26:03.145
About the law,
about what was right.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.521
Before the clothes
and the expense account,

26:04.605 --> 26:05.814
and scrambling to make partner.

26:05.897 --> 26:08.275
You're asking me to
commit career suicide.

26:08.359 --> 26:11.112
I'm asking you to trust me.

26:11.195 --> 26:14.030
One way or another,
Fisk, Owlsley,

26:14.115 --> 26:16.450
anyone connected
with what they've been doing,

26:16.533 --> 26:17.993
they're gonna get
what's coming to them.

26:18.076 --> 26:19.453
And there are gonna be
some hard questions

26:19.536 --> 26:22.748
about how much Landman and Zack knew
and when they knew it.

26:22.831 --> 26:25.876
This is your chance
to get out in front of that...

26:25.959 --> 26:27.628
and take your soul back.

26:31.089 --> 26:32.633
[indistinct conversations]

26:36.345 --> 26:37.888
[cars honking]

26:49.733 --> 26:51.735
[bicycle chain whirring]

26:54.363 --> 26:55.656
-[car honking]
-[man] Whoa! Whoa, watch out!

26:55.739 --> 26:57.115
[skidding]

26:57.199 --> 26:59.451
[dog panting]

27:01.537 --> 27:03.955
[coughing]

27:04.039 --> 27:05.582
[sneezing]

27:07.083 --> 27:09.044
[cane tapping]

27:53.380 --> 27:57.050
[classical music playing on car stereo]

27:59.720 --> 28:00.929
[music fades]

28:20.491 --> 28:22.493
[music continues faintly]

28:32.461 --> 28:34.087
[music continues]

28:54.650 --> 28:55.817
[grunts]

29:00.281 --> 29:01.907
[music continues]

29:22.177 --> 29:23.887
[music continues]

29:37.192 --> 29:38.819
[music continues]

29:52.165 --> 29:55.544
-[panting]
-[classical music ends]

30:00.215 --> 30:03.259
[knocking rhythmically]

30:23.655 --> 30:24.865
Ellison in his office?

30:24.948 --> 30:27.826
His kid's got something at school,
he'll be in later.

30:41.089 --> 30:46.345
[Fisk] I know you want to stay,
but it's not safe at Saint Benezet.

30:46.428 --> 30:48.847
There are people...
They--

30:48.930 --> 30:50.766
I liked it there.

30:52.643 --> 30:57.564
They brought me a piece of Zuppa
every night before I went to bed.

30:57.648 --> 31:00.191
They have Zuppa in Italy, Mother.
The real kind.

31:00.275 --> 31:03.404
I don't know any Italian.

31:03.487 --> 31:07.032
-What am I gonna watch on the TV?
-Oh, we'll sort it out.

31:09.075 --> 31:13.329
They brought a piece of Zuppa...
every night.

31:14.831 --> 31:15.999
Mother...

31:20.336 --> 31:21.922
Mom.

31:27.177 --> 31:29.971
It's such a beautiful day, isn't it?

31:30.681 --> 31:31.848
It is.

31:33.308 --> 31:37.312
Have you thought any more about my...
my friend Wesley?

31:37.396 --> 31:39.230
James Wesley?

31:39.314 --> 31:42.358
We spoke about him on the phone.

31:43.026 --> 31:45.446
[gasps] Oh, yes, James.

31:45.529 --> 31:48.114
-Such a handsome boy.
-Mmm.

31:48.198 --> 31:50.742
Always so well dressed, polite.

31:50.826 --> 31:53.078
He called you the other night.

31:54.245 --> 31:55.456
He did?

31:56.915 --> 32:00.335
When I was busy.
It was the last phone call that he...

32:02.212 --> 32:04.297
Do you remember
what you talked about?

32:09.470 --> 32:10.679
Mother?

32:13.765 --> 32:16.351
Such a beautiful day, isn't it?

32:20.021 --> 32:21.773
[sighs]

32:21.857 --> 32:23.775
[cell phone ringing]

32:25.944 --> 32:28.363
-Hey, is he back?
-[Ben] No.

32:28.447 --> 32:31.157
His kid plays the cello, got a solo.

32:31.241 --> 32:32.701
Looks like there's a reception after.

32:32.784 --> 32:36.497
-Did you try his phone?
-Yeah, he's not picking up. Look...

32:36.580 --> 32:40.041
sit tight until he gets back
and I can run this past him.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.460
And keep your eyes open, okay?

32:41.543 --> 32:43.712
Yeah.
You, too.

32:44.671 --> 32:47.508
-[phone beeps]
-Uh, hang on a second.

32:48.383 --> 32:50.218
Yeah, I gotta take this.
It's Matt.

32:50.301 --> 32:51.720
I'll call you when I know something.

32:55.056 --> 32:56.517
Hey, you coming in?

32:56.600 --> 32:59.686
[wincing] I had a rough morning.
I'm gonna need the day.

33:00.395 --> 33:02.022
[groans] Listen...

33:02.105 --> 33:04.357
I'm working on something.

33:04.440 --> 33:06.109
I think it might help.

33:06.192 --> 33:09.655
But until I know for sure,
I need you to stay out of it.

33:09.738 --> 33:11.990
If you talk to Foggy,
you tell him the same?

33:13.825 --> 33:16.995
Uh, yeah, I'll pass it along...

33:17.078 --> 33:19.289
if I, uh, talk to him.

33:19.372 --> 33:20.707
Uh, Karen?

33:22.918 --> 33:25.962
Everything's gonna work out...
I promise.

33:27.673 --> 33:29.465
Yeah...

33:29.550 --> 33:31.176
See you tomorrow.

33:34.470 --> 33:36.682
-I'm not having this conversation.
-[Ben] Yes, you are.

33:36.765 --> 33:38.433
You're in the middle of having it with me.

33:38.517 --> 33:41.728
Heard my son play Brahms today,
in front of the entire school.

33:41.812 --> 33:43.980
One of the greatest
moments of my life.

33:44.064 --> 33:46.775
I read the story you handed me,
the exact opposite.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.484
This could expose Fisk.

33:48.569 --> 33:51.613
All this story is gonna do is
expose this paper to a lawsuit.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.990
I mean, there is no follow-up,
no corroboration.

33:54.074 --> 33:56.367
You read what his mother said
about what he did when he was a kid?

33:56.451 --> 33:57.619
She's a sick old lady.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.621
I mean, she probably thinks
Nixon's still in office.

33:59.705 --> 34:01.748
Run the article.
It'll sell papers, it's sexy.

34:01.832 --> 34:03.249
You sound like a whore.

34:03.333 --> 34:05.544
Well, I learned how to be one from you.

34:06.377 --> 34:08.379
I get lucky sometimes, sure.

34:08.463 --> 34:10.882
Land a story that makes a difference,
like Union Allied.

34:10.966 --> 34:14.886
But most of the time, now,
working for this paper...

34:14.970 --> 34:18.348
I might as well be wearing
lipstick and a red dress.

34:20.350 --> 34:23.478
Take the rest of the week.
You're suspended.

34:23.562 --> 34:25.772
Look, just take another look at it.

34:25.856 --> 34:28.524
Fisk is leaving a trail of bodies
and if we don't stop it--

34:28.609 --> 34:32.738
Wilson Fisk is spending millions
of dollars trying to save this city.

34:32.821 --> 34:34.489
Maybe you should drop
the Woodward and Bernstein,

34:34.573 --> 34:37.450
try writing a story about that.

34:37.533 --> 34:38.827
How much is he paying you?

34:41.121 --> 34:43.206
Ever since Union Allied,

34:43.289 --> 34:47.961
I can't get a story that's about what's
really happening in this city to print.

34:48.879 --> 34:51.840
So, how much is Fisk paying you
to keep it that way?

34:51.923 --> 34:56.637
The reason that you can't get any of
your crime pieces into the paper lately

34:56.720 --> 34:59.139
is because they're shit, Ben.

34:59.222 --> 35:00.556
Just like that one.

35:00.641 --> 35:04.185
And I think, deep down,
you know that, too.

35:04.269 --> 35:06.855
You know what,
forget about the suspension.

35:06.938 --> 35:09.024
Clear out your office.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.234
I'm done trying to help you.

Wait, no, please!

[all clamoring]

38:41.402 --> 38:44.739
[Leland] Couldn't find anything on
the Japanese that puts them on this.

38:44.823 --> 38:45.907
Not that I would.

38:45.991 --> 38:49.660
Bastards are like
shadows in a dark room.

38:49.744 --> 38:52.788
Maybe all this really was
that nut in the mask.

38:54.374 --> 38:57.919
Poison and guns aren't
the way he operates.

38:58.003 --> 39:01.506
Piss a guy off enough,
he'll start doing whatever it takes.

39:01.589 --> 39:02.841
Francis.

39:04.467 --> 39:05.593
Sir?

39:05.676 --> 39:07.595
Double the offer on the streets.

39:07.678 --> 39:10.598
-Keep doubling it until someone talks.
-Yes, sir.

39:12.142 --> 39:14.769
You trust him after
that beating you laid on?

39:15.686 --> 39:17.022
Wesley trusted him.

39:17.105 --> 39:19.232
-That's all that matters now.
-[cell phone ringing]

39:19.315 --> 39:20.650
That his?

39:20.733 --> 39:21.817
Yes?

39:23.528 --> 39:26.531
No, he's not able to come to the phone.
What do you have?

39:31.161 --> 39:32.495
Thank you.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.665
I have to go.

39:35.748 --> 39:39.002
Go where?

All those people...

40:17.582 --> 40:19.875
-You took their eyes.
-No.

40:19.960 --> 40:22.378
They blinded themselves.

40:22.462 --> 40:24.005
Why would they do that?

40:24.089 --> 40:26.549
Because they have faith.

40:26.632 --> 40:29.052
In you and your drugs?

40:29.135 --> 40:32.805
In something beyond
the distractions of your world.

40:34.057 --> 40:36.184
You have taken that from them.

40:37.268 --> 40:40.105
Now, they will have nothing.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.565
You're gonna tell me about Fisk.

Don't you move!

Hands, let me see your hands!

Hands!

42:14.865 --> 42:16.409
Slowly, slowly.

42:17.577 --> 42:19.370
You're the guy.

42:19.454 --> 42:21.497
The one that killed Blake
and shot those cops!

42:24.542 --> 42:26.294
[both grunting]

42:26.377 --> 42:30.048
I did not kill Detective Blake,

42:37.972 --> 42:40.933
Along with a lot of others
in your precinct.

42:41.016 --> 42:43.228
I'm not the bad guy.

42:43.311 --> 42:44.520
Then what are you?

42:44.604 --> 42:46.106
[siren wailing]

42:51.277 --> 42:53.363

Call it in now.

[sirens wailing in distance]

[sighs]

43:06.751 --> 43:07.877
You're late.

43:07.960 --> 43:11.672
Apologies, I was detained
by unfortunate events.

43:13.841 --> 43:15.260
You speak English now?

43:15.760 --> 43:18.053
The need for illusion has passed.

43:19.680 --> 43:22.225
That have anything to do
with why you're late?

43:22.308 --> 43:24.310
The man in the mask.

43:24.394 --> 43:27.688
-The heroin?
-Lost in the flames.

43:28.606 --> 43:29.940
So, bring more in.

43:30.024 --> 43:33.361
My interest here has never been
about heroin, Leland.

43:33.444 --> 43:37.907
That was borne of convenience,
and it is no longer so.

43:39.450 --> 43:43.621
Do what you want.
I could honestly care less.

43:43.704 --> 43:47.542
If he finds out what we did...
this isn't gonna matter.

43:47.625 --> 43:49.377
Wilson suspects?

43:49.460 --> 43:51.337
Not yet, but that could change.

43:51.421 --> 43:54.924
We knew the risk,
and the reward,

43:55.007 --> 43:58.344
if his woman were to be removed
as a distraction.

43:58.428 --> 44:00.430
I should've just had her shot.

44:00.513 --> 44:03.057
Well, he still believes that
the poison was meant for him,

44:03.141 --> 44:04.892
-yes?
-Far as I know.

44:04.975 --> 44:07.312
Then our path was the correct one.

44:07.395 --> 44:10.022
Except for the part
where she's not dead, sure.

44:10.105 --> 44:12.858
The woman is stronger
than assumed.

44:12.942 --> 44:14.902
Yeah, she's a real mule.

44:16.737 --> 44:17.863
What about Wesley?

44:17.947 --> 44:20.283
-What about him?
-He's dead.

44:20.366 --> 44:23.411
Found in a basement,
couple holes in his chest.

44:23.494 --> 44:24.704
Thought maybe that was you.

44:24.787 --> 44:28.791
No... he had never
shown me discourtesy.

44:28.874 --> 44:29.917
[sighs]

44:30.918 --> 44:32.670
So, what's our play here?

44:32.753 --> 44:35.423
The wheel constantly turns.

44:35.506 --> 44:39.927
We must adapt to its position,
or be crushed beneath it.

44:40.010 --> 44:42.930
What? Where the hell are you going?

44:43.013 --> 44:46.892
I will visit my homeland
and reflect upon the future.

44:46.976 --> 44:48.478
Home? China?

44:50.605 --> 44:53.233
It is a considerable distance farther.

44:54.900 --> 44:56.569
We shall not speak again.

44:58.195 --> 44:59.489
Fine, go!

45:00.406 --> 45:02.700
You think I don't have a fallback?

45:02.783 --> 45:06.912
You think I got this far without looking
at my own damn tea leaves, huh?

45:08.122 --> 45:11.041
What, you think I'm gonna just...

45:22.262 --> 45:24.680
[sighs] Those for me?

45:24.764 --> 45:26.891
Till I get a better girl.

45:26.974 --> 45:28.393
You can't get a better girl.

45:28.476 --> 45:31.186
-Don't I know it.
-[laughing]

45:31.771 --> 45:32.980
Ah... [laughs]

45:34.815 --> 45:35.816
Mmm.

45:37.777 --> 45:38.819
Hard day?

45:38.903 --> 45:40.571
[sighs]

45:40.655 --> 45:41.781
I've had better.

45:41.864 --> 45:44.700
You've had worse, too.
Am I right?

45:45.618 --> 45:47.287
Usually are.

45:47.370 --> 45:49.246
I have my moments.

45:49.330 --> 45:51.749
Not many lately, but...

45:53.501 --> 45:55.169
Let's go to Paris...

45:56.337 --> 45:58.798
-like we always talked about.
-[chuckles]

46:01.050 --> 46:02.677
While we're still young.

46:02.760 --> 46:06.013
Ooh, you want to run away together?

46:06.096 --> 46:08.891
Or just... run away?

46:11.977 --> 46:14.605
How long we been together?

46:14.689 --> 46:17.525
Don't remember a time
when we weren't.

46:17.608 --> 46:21.070
Got to know that look
in your eye early on.

46:21.153 --> 46:26.367
Ben, there's a story eating at you...
one you know you gotta tell.

46:27.284 --> 46:29.286
Not that simple.

46:29.370 --> 46:32.790
Telling the truth is never simple...
or easy.

46:32.873 --> 46:35.835
Why, only the best of us ever really try.

46:36.669 --> 46:37.753
Yeah.

46:38.671 --> 46:40.506
Ellison thinks it's a pile of shit.

46:40.590 --> 46:43.258
You straighten him out.

46:43.343 --> 46:45.345
We got into it.

46:47.638 --> 46:49.223
He let me go.

46:52.101 --> 46:55.270
Good...
You never needed that man.

46:55.355 --> 46:57.314
You never needed that paper.

46:57.398 --> 46:59.900
You only ever needed a story.

46:59.984 --> 47:01.361
Go tell it.

47:01.444 --> 47:03.863
How? Shout it from the rooftops?

47:03.946 --> 47:08.158
You know there's this thing
called the Internet, right?

47:08.242 --> 47:11.203
Reach a whole lot of folks, huh?

47:11.286 --> 47:13.789
More than you ever could
at the Bulletin.

47:13.873 --> 47:16.667
The Internet's all gossip, noise.

47:16.751 --> 47:18.586
So, cut through it.

47:18.669 --> 47:21.631
The world needs Ben Urich
to tell the truth...

47:21.714 --> 47:23.966
any way he can.

47:28.095 --> 47:30.890
-You quit?
-Not exactly the way it went.

47:30.973 --> 47:32.224
[Karen] Oh...

47:32.307 --> 47:34.935
[sighs] I'm sorry.

47:35.019 --> 47:36.521
Don't be.

47:36.604 --> 47:38.773
Bulletin's not the paper
I fell in love with.

47:38.856 --> 47:40.065
Hasn't been for a long time.

47:40.149 --> 47:42.818
Just too damn stubborn to let it go.

47:42.902 --> 47:45.738
You really think Ellison
was taking money from Fisk?

47:45.821 --> 47:48.991
Don't know.
Explains a lot.

47:49.074 --> 47:51.577
So, uh, what do we do next?

47:51.661 --> 47:53.829
Thinking I might start a blog.

47:53.913 --> 47:55.289
Hear that's all you kids
read these days.

47:55.372 --> 47:57.750
I thought you hated that kind of shit.

47:57.833 --> 48:00.002
Yeah, but you can reach
an awful lot of people that way

48:00.085 --> 48:02.337
if you got the right story to tell.

48:02.422 --> 48:04.048
You're gonna write about
Fisk killing his father?

48:05.633 --> 48:07.677
I'm going to write about all of it...

48:07.760 --> 48:08.928
tonight.

48:09.762 --> 48:11.013
Get it out there.

48:11.096 --> 48:13.433
Fisk wants to sue me...

48:14.975 --> 48:16.852
at least I know a couple decent lawyers.

48:16.936 --> 48:18.395
[chuckles]

48:18.479 --> 48:21.566
This is gonna change everything, Ben.
It has to.

48:21.649 --> 48:23.609
One foot in front of the other.

48:23.693 --> 48:26.487
I'll send you the link when it's up.

48:26.571 --> 48:28.823
We'll go from there, okay?

48:28.906 --> 48:30.074
Call you in the morning.

48:30.157 --> 48:32.409
Okay. [sniffling]
Good night.

[banging on door]

48:55.725 --> 48:58.519
[Matt] Karen? Karen?
You in there?

49:00.730 --> 49:02.940
Yeah, just a minute.

49:08.195 --> 49:09.697
I'm sorry.

49:11.907 --> 49:14.201
We, uh, locking this now?

49:17.538 --> 49:18.914
Seems like a good idea.

49:25.212 --> 49:26.547
Yeah...

49:31.468 --> 49:34.013
It's, uh, late.
You should go home.

49:38.851 --> 49:39.977
Matt?

49:45.816 --> 49:47.943
Is this what we are now?

49:49.737 --> 49:52.865
Three people who don't even
talk to each other?

49:57.036 --> 49:58.621
I know this guy...

50:00.623 --> 50:02.416
We were close once.

50:05.169 --> 50:06.712
[stutters] He told me if I, uh...

50:09.464 --> 50:13.052
I'd have to push the people
that I care about away...

50:16.305 --> 50:18.599
if I wanted to be effective at what I do.

50:21.602 --> 50:23.563
Seems like you listened.

50:24.980 --> 50:26.023
Yeah.

50:27.066 --> 50:28.776
I thought I didn't.

50:29.944 --> 50:32.572
This guy, he has a way of, uh...

50:33.656 --> 50:35.950
getting in your head, you know?

50:40.412 --> 50:41.914
And here's the thing...

50:43.332 --> 50:45.125
I had a really shitty night.

50:47.169 --> 50:50.756
The kind where you think
you've seen the bottom of humanity,

50:50.840 --> 50:55.219
and the pit just keeps
getting deeper, you know?

50:58.639 --> 51:00.933
I... I can't...

51:03.102 --> 51:04.937
I can't do this alone.

51:07.898 --> 51:09.233
I can't...

51:11.276 --> 51:14.238
I can't take another step.

51:14.321 --> 51:16.573
[stifled sobbing]

51:27.126 --> 51:30.713
[sniffling] You're not alone, Matt.
You never were.

51:34.341 --> 51:36.218
[groans tearfully]

52:16.050 --> 52:18.135
[sighs deeply]

52:43.994 --> 52:46.163

52:55.255 --> 52:56.340
I've made mistakes...

52:58.175 --> 53:01.011
in the years since I was a boy.

53:02.096 --> 53:05.307
I try to learn from them,
but it isn't always enough.

53:06.516 --> 53:08.185
Get out of my house.

53:09.228 --> 53:10.604
I'll leave.

53:11.563 --> 53:15.609
But first, I'd... I'd like to have
a conversation with you.

53:15.692 --> 53:17.236
Off the record, of course.

53:17.903 --> 53:20.072
You think I believe
anything you have to say?

53:21.573 --> 53:26.036
Well, I... I promise that
I'll be honest with you, Mr. Urich.

53:27.371 --> 53:30.207
Whether you choose to believe,
that's up to you.

53:33.543 --> 53:34.879
All right.

53:36.881 --> 53:38.090
Let's hear it.

53:38.173 --> 53:39.925
I want to apologize.

53:43.470 --> 53:47.767
I thought that your days
of being relevant were past.

53:48.976 --> 53:50.770
And for thinking that, I...

53:51.812 --> 53:53.814
I'm truly sorry.

53:54.899 --> 53:56.525
Apology accepted.

53:58.861 --> 54:00.529
You know where the door is.

54:00.612 --> 54:02.114
Oh...

54:05.034 --> 54:08.537
I know you lost your position
at the Bulletin.

54:10.080 --> 54:11.791
News travels fast.

54:11.874 --> 54:17.379
After your article on...
Union Allied, I took precautions.

54:18.881 --> 54:21.675
I didn't want to be surprised
by any more exposés.

54:22.717 --> 54:25.595
Figured you had somebody
at the paper on your payroll.

54:26.221 --> 54:29.724
As I said,
I try to learn from my mistakes.

54:32.937 --> 54:34.396
You're not the only one.

54:36.982 --> 54:41.361
And do you think that rambling
on the Internet will change anything?

54:43.030 --> 54:46.783
People seek the truth...
no matter where they find it.

54:48.077 --> 54:51.621
That may have been the case
when you and I were young.

54:54.333 --> 54:59.922
This world around us is preoccupied
with celebrity weddings and...

55:00.923 --> 55:02.507
videos of cats.

55:03.175 --> 55:07.262
But... complicated issues,
issues that matter...

55:10.474 --> 55:12.392
they take too much focus.

55:14.186 --> 55:16.771
They take too much
time away from texting

55:16.856 --> 55:19.859
and the thousand channels
on the satellite dish.

55:20.692 --> 55:23.278
Guess I have more faith in humanity.

55:23.362 --> 55:24.821
Ah.

55:26.198 --> 55:28.325
So did Christ, if I recall.

55:30.995 --> 55:32.371
I'll go.

55:33.330 --> 55:35.165
Just one more thing.

55:39.669 --> 55:42.381
Were you alone when
you spoke to my mother?

55:49.513 --> 55:51.140
Your guy at the Bulletin.

55:51.223 --> 55:54.268
Yes, I received a call
that was upsetting.

55:56.353 --> 55:58.313
Were you alone?

56:00.357 --> 56:03.777
Yeah...
I was alone.

56:06.113 --> 56:08.365
Wesley, was that you?

56:09.408 --> 56:12.827
-Wesley?
-Yes, I didn't think so.

56:12.912 --> 56:14.746
You're a man of principle,
of conviction.

56:14.829 --> 56:17.624
I understand that,
I even admire it.

56:22.379 --> 56:24.756
But you went after my mother.

56:27.717 --> 56:30.804
That's not something
that I can forgive.

56:35.267 --> 56:38.437
I wrote a lot of stories
in my years pushing ink.

56:40.064 --> 56:43.483
You know how many times
people have threatened me...

56:43.567 --> 56:45.485
get me to keep my mouth shut?

56:46.946 --> 56:52.492
But this is my mother...
that you brought into this, Mr. Urich.

56:52.576 --> 56:53.785
My mother!

56:58.540 --> 57:01.085
So I am not here to threaten you.

57:01.168 --> 57:03.003
I'm here to kill you.

57:03.087 --> 57:04.671
[grunting]

57:08.092 --> 57:09.301
[Ben choking]

57:09.384 --> 57:10.844
[screaming]

57:39.289 --> 57:41.375
[sighs deeply]

57:52.177 --> 57:53.387
[sighs]

58:06.441 --> 58:08.443
[dramatic music playing]
