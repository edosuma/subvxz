01:42.693 --> 01:44.862
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

05:43.380 --> 05:45.758
Penguin sighting! Man or myth?

05:45.966 --> 05:49.137
What is he? Today's edition.
Another penguin sighting.

05:49.221 --> 05:51.890
Another penguin sighting! Check it out!

05:52.057 --> 05:56.646
Penguin man living in Gotham's sewers!
Read all about the latest sighting!

06:01.567 --> 06:03.986
<i>May I have your attention, Gotham City?</i>

06:04.237 --> 06:07.366
<i>It is time for tonight's lighting of the tree.</i>

06:12.121 --> 06:13.623
How about that?

06:29.975 --> 06:32.854
Part man, part penguin! All horrifying!

06:33.604 --> 06:36.314
Find out for only 50 cents! Come on!

06:36.773 --> 06:40.862
Read about the possible terror
beneath our feet! Check it out!

06:41.112 --> 06:42.613
Read about it!

06:45.242 --> 06:47.411
Missing link between man and bird.

06:47.494 --> 06:48.829
My dear boy...

06:48.997 --> 06:51.958
...sometimes it's a diversion
to read such rubbish.

06:52.125 --> 06:54.293
Usually, it's a waste of time.

06:54.460 --> 06:57.922
Whatever. Today's issue!
"The Penguin: Man or myth?"

06:58.840 --> 07:01.385
<i>The Globe! Right here! 25 cents!</i>

07:25.996 --> 07:27.665
Well, here's hoping.

07:27.832 --> 07:31.543
With luck, Gotham will have its first
merry Christmas in years.

07:31.710 --> 07:34.297
I feel almost vulgar at Yuletide...

07:34.672 --> 07:36.883
...mentioning the new power plant.

07:37.050 --> 07:40.846
But if we're to break ground
when we must, I'll need permits...

07:41.180 --> 07:44.726
...variances, tax incentives.
That sort of pesky nonsense.

07:46.186 --> 07:47.645
Power plant?

07:47.853 --> 07:52.359
Studies show we've enough power to get
us into the middle of the next century.

07:52.526 --> 07:56.989
Your analysts foresee growth
at 1% per annum. That's a mild swelling.

07:58.741 --> 07:59.909
Imagine...

08:00.201 --> 08:01.703
...a Gotham City...

08:02.412 --> 08:05.831
...of the future, lit up like a blanket
of stars...

08:06.375 --> 08:08.669
...but blinking on and off...

08:09.044 --> 08:11.255
...embarrassingly low on juice.

08:11.505 --> 08:12.840
Frankly...

08:13.591 --> 08:15.510
...I cringe, Mr. Mayor.

08:16.678 --> 08:19.515
Sorry, any plans must go
to the usual committees...

08:19.598 --> 08:21.600
...through the usual channels.

08:21.684 --> 08:23.519
I have a suggestion.

08:31.444 --> 08:32.529
Well...

08:33.446 --> 08:36.366
...actually, really, just more like a question.

08:38.535 --> 08:41.998
I'm afraid we haven't
properly housebroken Ms. Kyle.

08:42.874 --> 08:44.835
In the plus column, though...

08:44.960 --> 08:46.753
...she makes great coffee.

08:55.430 --> 08:56.307
Dad.

08:57.308 --> 09:00.977
Mr. Mayor. Time to go down
and bring joy to the masses.

09:11.656 --> 09:13.409
"Actually, more of a question."

09:13.492 --> 09:15.328
You stupid corn dog.

09:16.578 --> 09:18.331
Corn dog, corn dog.

09:45.486 --> 09:49.491
I have enough signatures
from Shreck employees to warrant a recall.

09:49.658 --> 09:52.202
That's not a threat, just simple numbers.

09:52.285 --> 09:56.414
Maybe. But you sure as hell
don't have an issue or a candidate.

09:57.667 --> 09:59.835
<i>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

10:00.753 --> 10:04.007
<i>From those of us at City Hall
to each and every one of you...</i>

10:04.091 --> 10:05.551
<i>... happy holidays.</i>

10:06.343 --> 10:10.847
<i>We have with us a man who needs
no introduction, he's given us so much.</i>

10:11.682 --> 10:15.144
<i>Please welcome Gotham's
own Santa Claus, Max Shreck.</i>

10:36.752 --> 10:39.589
Pick up those contracts for Personnel and...

10:39.755 --> 10:42.551
...pick up the dry cleaning
and paper towels...

10:45.428 --> 10:46.346
Darn!

10:52.270 --> 10:53.771
I forgot my speech.

10:53.938 --> 10:56.608
Remind me to take it out
on what's-her-name.

11:00.946 --> 11:02.406
<i>Santa Claus?</i>

11:02.615 --> 11:03.949
<i>Afraid not.</i>

11:05.117 --> 11:07.661
<i>I'm just a poor schmo. Got lucky.</i>

11:09.247 --> 11:10.582
<i>Sue me...</i>

11:11.124 --> 11:13.168
<i>... if I want to give some back.</i>

11:16.130 --> 11:19.091
<i>I only wish I could hand out more
than just...</i>

11:19.258 --> 11:20.928
<i>... expensive baubles.</i>

11:22.136 --> 11:24.890
<i>I wish I could hand out world peace...</i>

11:25.641 --> 11:27.893
<i>... and unconditional love...</i>

11:29.436 --> 11:31.481
<i>... wrapped in a big bow.</i>

11:33.107 --> 11:34.776
<i>Oh, but you can.</i>

11:35.318 --> 11:37.029
<i>Oh, but you will.</i>

11:43.953 --> 11:45.496
Merry Christmas.

11:58.970 --> 12:00.388
Great idea.

12:01.013 --> 12:02.139
Not mine.

12:54.741 --> 12:57.118
What are you waiting for? The signal!

13:28.445 --> 13:31.615
We want the big guy!
The guy who runs the show!

13:34.369 --> 13:35.536
What do you want?

13:35.620 --> 13:36.913
Not you!

13:37.790 --> 13:38.791
Shreck!

13:39.208 --> 13:41.210
You'll have to go through me.

13:43.129 --> 13:45.047
Dad, go! Save yourself!

13:45.297 --> 13:46.298
Dad, go!

15:40.594 --> 15:41.887
Shut up!

15:50.021 --> 15:52.691
Take one step closer, Mr. Manbat, and I'll...

15:58.614 --> 15:59.782
You missed.

16:12.964 --> 16:14.382
The Batman.

16:15.133 --> 16:17.135
Or is it just "Batman"?

16:21.432 --> 16:23.143
Your choice, of course.

16:25.436 --> 16:26.937
Well, that was...

16:27.271 --> 16:28.607
...very brief.

16:29.107 --> 16:31.276
Just like all the men in my life.

16:32.110 --> 16:33.445
What men?

16:34.238 --> 16:35.281
Well...

16:36.282 --> 16:39.578
...then again, there's you.
But you need therapy.

17:01.309 --> 17:05.146
Thanks for saving the day, Batman.
The Circus Gang is back.

17:05.314 --> 17:06.482
We'll see.

17:06.648 --> 17:10.069
They almost made off with our mover
and shaker, Max Shreck.

17:10.819 --> 17:12.906
Where is that insufferable son of a bitch?

18:30.243 --> 18:33.204
I believe the word you're looking for is...

18:44.343 --> 18:47.137
Actually, this is all just a bad dream.

18:48.263 --> 18:50.098
You're at home in bed...

18:50.265 --> 18:53.186
...heavily sedated, resting comfortably...

18:53.770 --> 18:57.524
...dying from the carcinogens
you've personally spewed...

18:58.609 --> 19:01.111
...in a lifetime of profiteering.

19:01.445 --> 19:02.864
Tragic irony...

19:03.031 --> 19:04.865
...or poetic justice?

19:05.032 --> 19:06.492
You tell me.

19:07.701 --> 19:09.454
My God, it's true.

19:09.871 --> 19:11.957
Penguin Man of the sewer.

19:16.212 --> 19:18.339
Odd as it may seem, Max...

19:19.298 --> 19:22.051
...you and I have something in common:

19:24.220 --> 19:26.723
We're both perceived as monsters.

19:31.062 --> 19:32.605
But somehow...

19:33.982 --> 19:36.652
...you're a well-respected monster...

19:36.986 --> 19:38.988
...and I am, to date...

19:39.988 --> 19:41.239
...not!

19:41.490 --> 19:44.952
Frankly, I feel that's a bum rap.
I'm a businessman.

19:45.327 --> 19:46.704
Tough, yes.

19:46.870 --> 19:50.292
Shrewd, okay. But that does not
make me a monster.

19:51.042 --> 19:53.379
Don't embarrass yourself, Max!

19:53.671 --> 19:55.548
I know all about you.

19:55.840 --> 19:57.967
What you hide, I discover.

19:59.051 --> 20:01.178
What you put in your toilet...

20:01.345 --> 20:04.224
...I place on my mantle. Get the picture?

20:04.891 --> 20:07.185
Is that supposed to hypnotize me?

20:07.394 --> 20:09.981
No, just give you a splitting headache.

20:10.857 --> 20:12.275
It's not working.

20:13.401 --> 20:15.111
Oh, you big baby!

20:15.695 --> 20:17.030
Just blanks.

20:17.238 --> 20:20.367
Would I go through all this trouble
just to kill you?

20:20.576 --> 20:21.869
No, Max.

20:22.244 --> 20:24.747
I have an entirely other purpose.

20:25.915 --> 20:27.500
I'm ready, Max.

20:28.043 --> 20:30.337
I've been down here too long.

20:30.712 --> 20:33.006
It's time for me to ascend...

20:33.715 --> 20:35.425
...to re-emerge...

20:37.094 --> 20:38.638
...with your help...

20:38.763 --> 20:40.389
...your know-how...

20:40.556 --> 20:42.100
your savvy

20:42.935 --> 20:45.604
I wasn't born in the sewer, you know.

20:46.730 --> 20:48.274
I come from...

20:48.942 --> 20:50.276
...like you.

20:50.567 --> 20:53.154
And, like you, I want some respect!

20:53.905 --> 20:56.491
A recognition of my basic humanity.

20:57.283 --> 20:58.744
But most of all...

20:59.745 --> 21:02.122
...I want to find out who I am...

21:02.289 --> 21:04.292
...by finding my parents...

21:04.459 --> 21:06.586
...learning my human name.

21:07.462 --> 21:11.424
Simple stuff that the good people
of Gotham take for granted!

21:12.926 --> 21:14.094
And...

21:14.260 --> 21:17.014
...exactly why am I going to help you?

21:18.808 --> 21:19.976
Well...

21:24.648 --> 21:26.107
Let's start.

21:34.284 --> 21:36.661
Let's see what we have in here.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.919
A batch of toxic waste...

21:44.128 --> 21:46.630
...from your clean textile plant!

21:47.506 --> 21:50.760
There's a whole lagoon of this crud
in the back!

21:50.969 --> 21:53.138
It could have come from anywhere.

21:53.555 --> 21:58.060
What about the documents that prove you
own half of the firetraps in Gotham City?

21:58.311 --> 22:00.480
If there were such documents...

22:00.647 --> 22:02.440
...that's not an admission...

22:02.523 --> 22:04.567
...they would've been shredded.

22:05.444 --> 22:06.820
Good idea.

22:08.196 --> 22:12.118
A lot of tape and a little patience
make all the difference.

22:14.954 --> 22:16.457
By the way...

22:16.957 --> 22:19.376
...how's Fred Atkins, your old partner?

22:19.626 --> 22:20.793
Fred?

22:21.879 --> 22:23.547
Fred's actually...

22:24.131 --> 22:27.260
I believe he's on an extended vacation.
He's good.

22:30.805 --> 22:31.973
Good.

22:33.976 --> 22:36.854
Hiya, Max. Remember me?
I'm Fred's hand!

22:38.147 --> 22:40.733
Want to greet any other body parts?

22:41.067 --> 22:42.735
Remember, Max...

22:42.985 --> 22:45.280
...you flush it, I flaunt it.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.327
You know what, Mr. Penguin, sir?

22:54.667 --> 22:56.250
I think, perhaps...

22:56.417 --> 22:59.837
...I could help orchestrate
a "Welcome Home" scenario for you.

22:59.921 --> 23:03.384
Once we're both back home,
perhaps we could help each other.

23:04.593 --> 23:07.138
You won't regret this, Mr. Shreck.

23:15.021 --> 23:16.691
Honey, I'm home!

23:18.859 --> 23:21.237
Oh, I forgot. I'm not married.

23:31.790 --> 23:33.209
Miss Kitty.

23:34.711 --> 23:38.172
Back from more sexual escapades
you refuse to share?

23:40.551 --> 23:42.386
Not that I'd ever pry.

23:44.306 --> 23:45.724
Drink your dinner.

23:52.314 --> 23:53.481
What?

23:54.983 --> 23:57.320
How can anyone be so pathetic?

23:58.821 --> 24:01.908
Yes, to you I seem pathetic,
but I'm a working girl.

24:02.075 --> 24:05.912
Must pay the rent. Maybe if you
chipped in instead of stepping out.

24:07.748 --> 24:11.251
<i>Selina, dear, it's your mother.
Just calling to say hello.</i>

24:11.418 --> 24:12.754
Yeah, but...

24:12.920 --> 24:16.257
<i>But I'm disappointed you're not
coming home for Christmas.</i>

24:16.341 --> 24:19.845
<i>I want to discuss why you insist
on languishing in Gotham City...</i>

24:19.928 --> 24:21.930
<i>... as some lowly secretary.</i>

24:22.097 --> 24:23.767
Lowly assistant.

24:25.684 --> 24:28.855
<i>Selina, about that Christmas getaway
we planned...</i>

24:29.939 --> 24:34.779
<i>I'll be going alone. Dr. Shaw says I need
to be my own person, not an appendage.</i>

24:39.200 --> 24:40.786
Some appendage!

24:46.291 --> 24:50.045
The party never stops
on Selina Kyle's answering machine.

24:52.131 --> 24:55.218
I should've let him win
that last racquetball game.

24:55.551 --> 24:56.553
<i>Hello...</i>

24:56.720 --> 24:58.222
<i>... Selina Kyle.</i>

24:58.389 --> 25:01.809
<i>We're calling to tell you about exciting,
new Gotham Lady perfume.</i>

25:01.892 --> 25:06.480
<i>It makes women feel like women...
and the men have no complaints either.</i>

25:08.817 --> 25:13.406
<i>This is yourself reminding you to come
all the way back to the office...</i>

25:14.782 --> 25:18.411
<i>- ... if you forgot the Bruce Wayne file...
- You stupid corn dog!</i>

25:38.057 --> 25:39.517
Working late?

25:41.895 --> 25:45.984
I'm just boning up for your Bruce Wayne
meeting in the morning.

25:46.693 --> 25:50.196
I pulled all the files
on the proposed power plant...

25:52.700 --> 25:56.954
...and Mr. Wayne's hoped-for investment.
I even opened the protected files...

25:58.205 --> 25:59.582
How industrious!

26:01.250 --> 26:03.587
How did you open the protected files?

26:04.588 --> 26:05.756
May I ask?

26:11.386 --> 26:15.642
I figured your password was "Geraldo,"
your Chihuahua, and it was.

26:23.400 --> 26:27.697
This is all very interesting,
though a bit on the technical side...

26:29.949 --> 26:33.578
...about how the power plant
is a power plant in name only...

26:33.912 --> 26:37.249
...since, in fact, it's going to be a big,
giant...

26:37.792 --> 26:39.919
...big, giant... capacitor.

26:42.589 --> 26:46.593
And, instead of generating power,
it'll be sucking power from...

26:47.469 --> 26:48.929
...Gotham City...

26:50.097 --> 26:51.640
...and storing it...

26:52.266 --> 26:53.935
...stockpiling it...

26:54.310 --> 26:57.271
...which is a very novel approach, I'd say.

27:00.150 --> 27:01.777
Who'd you say this to?

27:05.447 --> 27:06.448
Nobody.

27:12.789 --> 27:15.292
What did curiosity do to the cat?

27:17.503 --> 27:18.921
I'm no cat.

27:19.840 --> 27:21.675
I'm just an assistant.

27:22.133 --> 27:23.300
A secretary.

27:23.843 --> 27:25.679
And a very good one.

27:26.513 --> 27:27.806
Too good?

27:29.016 --> 27:30.100
Listen...

27:30.183 --> 27:32.353
...it's our secret. Honest.

27:32.645 --> 27:35.481
How can you be so mean
to someone so meaningless?

27:35.648 --> 27:37.151
This power plant...

27:37.651 --> 27:40.361
...is my legacy. It's what I leave behind.

27:40.528 --> 27:41.822
For Chip.

27:42.156 --> 27:44.283
Nothing must prevent that.

27:47.829 --> 27:51.791
Go ahead. Intimidate me.
Bully me, if it makes you feel big.

27:52.208 --> 27:54.211
It's not like you can kill me!

27:54.628 --> 27:57.006
Actually, it's a lot like that.

28:14.902 --> 28:17.653
For a second, you really frightened me.

28:28.333 --> 28:29.501
Really?

29:45.210 --> 29:46.545
Honey, I'm home!

29:49.799 --> 29:51.885
Oh, I forgot. I'm not married.

30:27.842 --> 30:30.595
<i>Selina, this is your mother. Call me.</i>

30:31.846 --> 30:35.768
<i>Selina, this is your mother.
Why haven't you called me back?</i>

30:36.394 --> 30:38.187
<i>Hello, Selina Kyle.</i>

30:39.021 --> 30:42.483
<i>We're just calling to make sure
you've tried Gotham Lady perfume.</i>

30:42.566 --> 30:46.822
<i>One whiff of this and your boss
will ask you to stay after work...</i>

30:47.030 --> 30:49.742
<i>... for a candlelight staff meeting for two.</i>

30:49.909 --> 30:53.913
<i>Gotham Lady perfume.
Exclusively at Shreck's department store.</i>

33:38.264 --> 33:41.560
I don't know about you,
Miss Kitty, but I feel...

33:42.352 --> 33:44.146
...so much yummier.

34:02.793 --> 34:04.378
<i>Ladies and gentlemen:</i>

34:06.213 --> 34:11.135
<i>I stand before you again to denounce
the urban chaos we live with in our city.</i>

34:12.386 --> 34:13.804
<i>It's got to stop.</i>

34:13.971 --> 34:17.016
<i>It's going to stop!
Our community is coming apart...</i>

34:17.266 --> 34:20.562
<i>... in a season when
it should be coming together.</i>

34:20.646 --> 34:24.234
<i>I don't care what the cynics may say.
This is the Christmas season...</i>

34:24.317 --> 34:25.985
<i>... and should be a healing time.</i>

34:26.069 --> 34:28.655
<i>I say that not only as an official...</i>

34:29.487 --> 34:31.658
<i>... but as a husband and a father.</i>

34:32.074 --> 34:34.577
<i>Last night's violence won't happen again.</i>

34:37.915 --> 34:41.002
<i>I'm not good at speeches,
so I'll just say, "Thanks."</i>

34:49.761 --> 34:52.056
<i>It's the hideous Penguin Man.</i>

34:52.598 --> 34:55.226
<i>Take the baby. Just don't hurt me, please!</i>

35:48.161 --> 35:52.248
<i>This was the remarkable scene
only minutes ago in Gotham Plaza.</i>

35:52.415 --> 35:55.920
<i>The mysterious Penguin saving the life
of the mayor's baby...</i>

35:56.087 --> 35:59.840
<i>- ... and announcing his presence.
- All I want in return...</i>

36:00.716 --> 36:02.343
<i>... is a chance...</i>

36:02.676 --> 36:04.805
<i>... to find my mom and dad.</i>

36:06.556 --> 36:09.185
<i>A chance to find out who they are...</i>

36:10.395 --> 36:11.854
<i>... and thusly...</i>

36:12.188 --> 36:13.648
<i>... who I am.</i>

36:14.399 --> 36:15.734
<i>And then...</i>

36:16.025 --> 36:17.902
<i>... with my parents...</i>

36:18.194 --> 36:20.364
<i>... try to understand... why.</i>

36:21.907 --> 36:25.411
<i>Why they did what I guess
they felt they had to do...</i>

36:27.580 --> 36:29.249
<i>... to a child...</i>

36:29.916 --> 36:31.544
<i>... who was born...</i>

36:34.587 --> 36:36.506
<i>... a little different.</i>

36:38.384 --> 36:39.510
<i>A child...</i>

36:40.052 --> 36:42.597
<i>... who spent his first Christmas...</i>

36:43.557 --> 36:45.392
<i>... and many since...</i>

36:46.935 --> 36:48.271
<i>... in a sewer.</i>

36:48.438 --> 36:50.690
Mr. Wayne? Something wrong?

36:54.277 --> 36:55.445
His parents.

36:55.611 --> 36:57.947
<i>This scene, direct from Gotham Plaza.</i>

36:59.408 --> 37:01.118
I hope he finds them.

37:02.119 --> 37:06.082
<i>Here he is, standing alongside
Gotham's leading citizen, Max Shreck.</i>

37:06.249 --> 37:09.126
<i>How about a statement?
People want to know.</i>

37:19.972 --> 37:23.143
- Penguin's not to be disturbed!
- It's a public place!

37:23.268 --> 37:25.812
- Walk. Now. Move.
- Freedom of the press!

37:25.896 --> 37:27.439
Wait a minute.

37:28.565 --> 37:31.903
What about the freedom
to rediscover your roots...

37:32.403 --> 37:34.405
...with dignity and privacy?

37:34.572 --> 37:36.908
Is the Penguin a personal friend?

37:37.075 --> 37:40.746
He's a personal friend of the whole city,
so have a heart.

37:40.996 --> 37:43.792
Give the Constitution a rest.
It's Christmas.

38:23.293 --> 38:27.132
"Red Triangle Circus put on
a swell show with fierce lions.

38:31.344 --> 38:33.722
"Circus returns for a two-week...

38:33.973 --> 38:35.474
"Kids will love..."

38:35.975 --> 38:37.059
Thanks.

38:41.355 --> 38:42.398
It's cold!

38:42.481 --> 38:43.900
It's vichyssoise.

38:45.068 --> 38:46.820
It's supposed to be cold.

38:49.365 --> 38:52.660
"Circus is back with a freak show,
may not be suitable for kids...

38:52.744 --> 38:54.830
"...featuring a poodle lady...

38:55.080 --> 38:57.081
"...the world's fattest man...

38:57.331 --> 38:59.459
"...and Aquatic Bird Boy."

39:00.586 --> 39:03.130
Why are you determined to prove...

39:03.380 --> 39:06.259
...that this Penguin is not what he seems?

39:06.676 --> 39:09.763
Must you be the only lonely "man-beast"
in town?

39:10.013 --> 39:12.099
"The circus folded its tents yesterday...

39:12.183 --> 39:15.393
"...after reports of missing children
in several towns.

39:15.602 --> 39:18.606
"Police have closed down
the Red Triangle fairgrounds.

39:18.689 --> 39:22.402
"However, at least one
freak-show performer vanished before...

39:22.861 --> 39:25.030
"...he could be questioned."

39:26.782 --> 39:28.785
I suppose you feel better now.

39:31.620 --> 39:32.621
No.

39:33.915 --> 39:35.917
Actually, I feel worse.

39:54.437 --> 39:55.940
<i>Why're you still out?</i>

39:56.023 --> 39:59.944
<i>Are you concerned about that strange,
heroic Penguin person?</i>

40:01.655 --> 40:04.032
I think he knows who his parents are.

40:05.867 --> 40:07.661
There's something else.

42:03.917 --> 42:05.168
Mr. Penguin...

42:05.252 --> 42:07.880
A penguin is a bird that cannot fly!

42:09.590 --> 42:11.008
I am a man!

42:12.175 --> 42:13.719
I have a name!

42:17.682 --> 42:19.393
Oswald Cobblepot!

42:21.270 --> 42:24.148
You'll never be able to settle with them?

42:27.610 --> 42:28.778
True.

42:29.863 --> 42:32.115
I was their "Number-One" son...

42:32.449 --> 42:35.034
...and they treated me like number two.

42:35.953 --> 42:38.372
But it's human nature to fear...

42:39.874 --> 42:41.293
...the unusual.

42:42.294 --> 42:43.670
Perhaps...

42:44.129 --> 42:45.672
...when I held my...

42:45.797 --> 42:47.799
...Tiffany baby rattle...

42:48.800 --> 42:50.886
...with a shiny flipper...

42:51.303 --> 42:53.890
...instead of five chubby digits...

42:55.391 --> 42:57.059
...they freaked.

43:00.814 --> 43:02.608
But I forgive them.

43:04.319 --> 43:07.321
"Penguin forgives parents!
'I'm at peace with myself and the world!

43:07.404 --> 43:09.991
"'Don't need hands as long
as you got heart.

43:10.116 --> 43:13.328
"'My heart is filled with love.
I feel five feet tall."'

43:13.411 --> 43:17.374
- He's like a frog that became a prince.
- No, he's more like a penguin.

43:23.005 --> 43:25.342
Now, now, pretty little thing.

43:25.759 --> 43:27.302
Nice and easy.

43:31.599 --> 43:36.355
I love a big, strong man who's not afraid
to show it with someone half his size.

43:38.816 --> 43:41.150
Be gentle, it's my first time.

43:48.368 --> 43:49.828
Tic-tac-toe.

43:55.292 --> 43:57.545
You make it easy, don't you?

43:58.045 --> 44:00.798
Always waiting for some Batman
to save you.

44:03.677 --> 44:05.345
I am Catwoman...

44:06.471 --> 44:08.140
...hear me roar.

44:22.489 --> 44:26.578
I'd offer you coffee, but my assistant
is using her vacation time.

44:26.703 --> 44:31.500
Good time. Everyone but the bandits'll
be slacking off till after the New Year.

44:32.084 --> 44:34.252
I'm not sure I like the inference.

44:34.335 --> 44:36.254
I didn't realize I made one.

44:41.010 --> 44:45.098
I'm pushing this power plant now
because it'll cost more later.

44:45.682 --> 44:47.935
A million saved is a million earned.

44:48.728 --> 44:51.522
I commissioned this report.
Take a look at it.

44:53.941 --> 44:57.612
Gotham City has a power surplus.
I'm sure you know that.

44:58.196 --> 44:59.782
My question is:

45:00.699 --> 45:01.867
What's your angle?

45:01.950 --> 45:04.579
"Power surplus?" Bruce, shame on you!

45:05.455 --> 45:08.750
No such thing. One can never have
too much power.

45:09.042 --> 45:12.128
If my life has a meaning,
that's the meaning.

45:14.005 --> 45:18.093
I'll fight you. I've already spoken
to the mayor and we agree.

45:18.260 --> 45:19.762
Mayors come and go.

45:19.970 --> 45:21.848
Blue bloods tire easily.

45:22.140 --> 45:24.643
Can you go 15 rounds
with Muhammad Shreck?

45:24.851 --> 45:26.854
I guess we'll find out.

45:27.146 --> 45:30.190
Of course, I don't have a crime boss
like Cobblepot in my corner.

45:30.273 --> 45:32.652
"Crime boss?" Shows what you know...

45:32.777 --> 45:35.613
..."Mr. To-The-Manor-Born-
With-A-Silver-Spoon."

45:35.696 --> 45:37.991
Oswald is Gotham's new golden boy.

45:38.242 --> 45:41.912
<i>If his parents hadn't 86'ed him,
you'd have been bunkies at prep school.</i>

45:41.995 --> 45:46.041
He controls the Red Triangle Gang.
I can't prove it yet, but we both...

45:46.208 --> 45:48.878
I'll not stand for mud-slinging here.

45:49.045 --> 45:52.423
If my assistant was here,
she'd have already escorted you out...

45:52.507 --> 45:54.051
Anywhere he wants.

45:54.301 --> 45:56.887
Preferably some nightspot grotto...

45:58.222 --> 45:59.223
or

45:59.683 --> 46:01.518
...secluded hideaway.

46:03.519 --> 46:04.895
Nice suit.

46:11.195 --> 46:15.408
That's my name, don't wear it out
or I'll make you buy me a new one.

46:19.705 --> 46:21.372
This is Bruce...

46:21.748 --> 46:22.833
...Wayne.

46:23.625 --> 46:24.751
We've met.

46:25.252 --> 46:26.253
Have we?

46:26.420 --> 46:29.591
No, I'm sorry. I mistook me
for somebody else.

46:31.092 --> 46:32.803
You mean, "mistook me."

46:33.554 --> 46:35.556
Isn't that what I said?

46:36.223 --> 46:37.850
I don't think so.

46:39.226 --> 46:40.478
What happened?

46:41.729 --> 46:44.691
Did you hurt yourself... on that ski slope?

46:46.234 --> 46:49.572
Is that why you cut short your vacation?
Came back?

46:52.867 --> 46:54.327
It's a blur.

46:55.788 --> 47:00.375
Not complete amnesia. I remember
Sister Mary Margaret puking in church...

47:01.293 --> 47:03.796
...and Betsy saying
it was morning sickness.

47:03.879 --> 47:07.050
And the time I forgot to wear
my underpants to school...

47:07.133 --> 47:10.970
...and the name of the boy who noticed
was Ricky Friedburg.

47:11.972 --> 47:13.516
He's dead now.

47:13.891 --> 47:15.391
But last night...

47:15.600 --> 47:17.311
...complete blur.

47:19.104 --> 47:21.023
Couldn't you just die?

47:25.153 --> 47:26.488
Please...

47:27.656 --> 47:29.283
...show out Mr. Wayne.

47:29.617 --> 47:30.993
With pleasure.

47:33.496 --> 47:35.373
Your coat, Mr. Wayne.

47:49.264 --> 47:52.517
You don't seem like the type
who does business with Shreck.

47:52.600 --> 47:55.354
No. You don't seem like the type
to take orders from him.

47:55.437 --> 47:56.856
Well, that's a...

47:57.106 --> 47:58.649
...long story.

47:59.441 --> 48:01.570
I could free up some time.

48:03.363 --> 48:05.365
- I'm listed.
- I'm tempted.

48:05.615 --> 48:06.826
I'm working.

48:08.118 --> 48:09.369
I'm leaving.

48:09.870 --> 48:11.873
You buy that blurry business?

48:12.039 --> 48:13.124
Women.

48:13.541 --> 48:15.418
Nothing surprises me...

48:15.960 --> 48:17.796
...except your late mother.

48:18.380 --> 48:21.216
Who'd have thought Selina
had a brain to damage?

48:21.383 --> 48:22.843
Bottom line?

48:23.219 --> 48:27.222
She tries to blackmail me,
I'll drop her out of a higher window.

48:27.389 --> 48:28.558
Meantime...

48:28.641 --> 48:31.019
...l've got badder fish to fry.

48:42.574 --> 48:43.908
Oswald...

48:44.492 --> 48:45.827
...it's Max.

48:59.176 --> 49:00.594
You're home?

49:08.019 --> 49:09.354
How've you been?

49:11.022 --> 49:12.900
Your extended family?

49:13.359 --> 49:14.985
Good to have a family.

49:16.779 --> 49:18.948
I'd rather not be disturbed now.

49:19.281 --> 49:22.201
Come on downstairs, Oswald.
I have a surprise.

49:22.368 --> 49:24.371
I don't like surprises.

49:41.390 --> 49:42.391
Come on.

49:55.405 --> 49:56.656
Don't peek.

49:58.826 --> 50:00.244
You'll spoil it.

50:23.604 --> 50:26.774
Adulation is a cross to bear.
God knows I know.

50:27.942 --> 50:31.654
But someone's got to supplant our
standing in the way of progress, Mayor.

50:31.738 --> 50:35.283
And don't deny it, Mr. Cobblepot,
you've got the magic.

50:35.451 --> 50:38.954
Your charisma's bigger than both of us.
Come on down.

50:41.124 --> 50:42.334
Mayor?

50:43.460 --> 50:44.669
Mayor.

50:46.714 --> 50:49.883
Elections happen in November.
It's late December.

50:50.050 --> 50:51.384
Don't worry.

50:51.551 --> 50:55.139
I want you to meet Jen and Josh,
my image consultants.

50:56.724 --> 50:57.893
Here.

50:58.060 --> 51:00.062
Reclaim your birthright.

51:02.689 --> 51:03.983
I'm Jen.

51:07.528 --> 51:12.033
Okay, let's see. What I'd like to do first
is put these gloves on you.

51:12.367 --> 51:15.371
Our research tells us
that voters like fingers.

51:15.538 --> 51:18.123
So if we were to just lose this...

51:19.709 --> 51:21.670
We'll do it another time.

51:23.379 --> 51:26.800
Not a lot of reflective surfaces
in the sewer, huh?

51:38.230 --> 51:40.148
Still, it could be worse.

51:40.899 --> 51:43.277
My nose could be gushing blood.

51:47.030 --> 51:49.117
What do you mean by that?

51:54.081 --> 51:56.125
Everybody, back to work!

51:56.917 --> 51:58.420
Let's make...

51:59.086 --> 52:00.504
...a mayor!

52:06.094 --> 52:09.097
You're right, we missed
the regular election...

52:09.265 --> 52:12.018
...but elected officials can be recalled,
impeached...

52:12.101 --> 52:14.771
...given the boot. Look at Nixon, Agnew.

52:14.938 --> 52:16.481
Then think of you...

52:16.607 --> 52:19.358
...Oswald Cobblepot, filling the void.

52:20.109 --> 52:21.904
I'd like to fill her void.

52:24.448 --> 52:28.703
We'll need signatures to overturn
the ballot. I can supply those.

52:29.287 --> 52:33.209
- Teach her my French flipper trick.
- We need one more thing.

52:35.585 --> 52:37.004
A platform?

52:38.464 --> 52:42.886
Stop global warming. Start global cooling.
Make the world an icebox.

52:43.303 --> 52:47.599
I like it. But to get the mayor recalled,
we must have a catalyst.

52:48.142 --> 52:50.478
"You're doing great, Mayor Cobblepot."

52:51.103 --> 52:53.898
"Your table is ready, Mayor Cobblepot."

52:54.607 --> 52:57.360
"I need you, Oswald. I need you now!"

52:59.279 --> 53:02.282
"That's the biggest parasol I've ever seen."

53:03.784 --> 53:08.039
Soon an incident like the Gulf of Tonkin,
or the Reichstag fire...

53:15.506 --> 53:18.008
You want my old friends up there...

53:18.175 --> 53:20.845
...to drive the mayor into a foaming frenzy?

53:21.012 --> 53:22.889
- Exactly.
- Sounds fun.

53:23.682 --> 53:24.766
But...

53:25.600 --> 53:28.228
...I mustn't get sidetracked, Maxie.

53:28.687 --> 53:30.856
I have my own things to tend to.

53:31.189 --> 53:34.694
"Sidetracked?" This is your chance
to fulfill your destiny...

53:34.861 --> 53:37.447
...that your parents carelessly discarded.

53:41.368 --> 53:43.454
Reclaim my birthright, you mean?

53:43.621 --> 53:46.623
Lmagine, as mayor,
you have the ear of the media...

53:46.874 --> 53:49.752
...access to the captains of industry...

53:50.295 --> 53:52.213
...unlimited poontang.

53:55.801 --> 53:58.220
You drive a hard bargain, Maxie.

53:59.556 --> 54:01.391
All right, I'll be mayor.

54:05.395 --> 54:07.105
Burn, baby, burn!

56:49.371 --> 56:51.457
- Who is she?
- What is she?

56:51.874 --> 56:54.835
I don't know whether to open fire
or fall in love.

56:55.545 --> 56:57.047
You poor guys.

56:57.214 --> 57:00.509
Always confusing your pistols
with your privates.

57:02.844 --> 57:05.597
Don't hurt us. Our take-home's
less than $300.

57:05.681 --> 57:07.725
You're overpaid. Hit the road.

57:26.079 --> 57:27.914
Go ahead and hit me.

58:06.291 --> 58:08.002
Admiring your handiwork?

58:10.254 --> 58:12.256
Touring the riot scene.

58:13.758 --> 58:16.302
Gravely assessing the devastation.

58:18.471 --> 58:20.474
"Upstanding-Mayor" stuff.

58:24.687 --> 58:26.272
You're not the mayor.

58:28.149 --> 58:29.692
Things change.

58:31.694 --> 58:33.112
What do you want?

58:33.988 --> 58:35.824
The direct approach.

58:36.158 --> 58:38.744
I admire that in a man with a mask.

58:43.792 --> 58:46.504
You don't really think you'll win, do you?

58:49.339 --> 58:50.882
Things change.

59:16.036 --> 59:18.330
I saw her first. Got to fly.

01:00:07.844 --> 01:00:10.097
How could you? I'm a woman!

01:00:10.848 --> 01:00:12.099
I'm sorry.

01:00:26.115 --> 01:00:30.036
As I was saying, I'm a woman
and can't be taken for granted.

01:00:31.705 --> 01:00:33.958
Life's a bitch, now so am I.

01:00:50.977 --> 01:00:52.144
Who are you?

01:00:52.811 --> 01:00:54.772
Who's the man behind the bat?

01:00:56.816 --> 01:00:58.902
Maybe you can help me find...

01:00:59.403 --> 01:01:00.821
...the woman...

01:01:01.488 --> 01:01:03.073
...behind the cat.

01:01:05.827 --> 01:01:07.620
No, that's not you.

01:01:11.249 --> 01:01:12.584
There you are.

01:01:28.602 --> 01:01:30.520
Saved by Kitty Litter.

01:01:34.525 --> 01:01:35.818
Bastard!

01:01:53.129 --> 01:01:54.214
Alfred...

01:01:54.965 --> 01:01:57.551
...bring me some antiseptic ointment.

01:01:57.718 --> 01:01:59.888
<i>Coming. Are you in pain, sir?</i>

01:02:02.724 --> 01:02:04.058
Not really.

01:02:26.416 --> 01:02:29.045
I may have saved the mayor's baby...

01:02:30.672 --> 01:02:33.175
...but I refuse to save a mayor...

01:02:33.342 --> 01:02:36.095
...who stood by, helpless as a baby...

01:02:36.512 --> 01:02:39.473
...while Gotham was ravaged
by a disease...

01:02:40.557 --> 01:02:43.853
...that turned Eagle Scouts
into crazed clowns...

01:02:45.355 --> 01:02:48.108
...and happy homemakers into catwomen.

01:02:49.277 --> 01:02:50.403
Thank you.

01:02:53.573 --> 01:02:57.910
Oswald Cobblepot, the mystery man-beast,
made his bid to run Gotham.

01:03:00.914 --> 01:03:05.419
Mr. Cobblepot, you are the coolest
role model a young person could have.

01:03:06.045 --> 01:03:08.548
And you're the hottest young person...

01:03:08.715 --> 01:03:10.883
...a role model could have.

01:03:13.387 --> 01:03:14.430
Here.

01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:16.974
Wear a button.

01:03:18.434 --> 01:03:20.603
Let me just get it on here.

01:03:25.233 --> 01:03:26.568
Thank you.

01:03:31.407 --> 01:03:35.912
This mayor stuff is not about power,
it's about reaching out to people...

01:03:36.078 --> 01:03:38.164
...touching people, groping people.

01:03:38.247 --> 01:03:40.167
- Penguin...
- My name is not Penguin!

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:42.169
It's Oswald Cobblepot.

01:03:42.794 --> 01:03:45.673
Oswald, there's somebody here to see you.

01:03:53.973 --> 01:03:56.644
Just the pussy I've been looking for.

01:04:01.441 --> 01:04:03.276
It's chilly in here.

01:04:04.444 --> 01:04:05.779
I'll warm you.

01:04:06.154 --> 01:04:07.657
Down, Oswald.

01:04:09.991 --> 01:04:11.451
We need to talk.

01:04:11.618 --> 01:04:12.995
You see...

01:04:13.162 --> 01:04:15.915
...you and I have something in common.

01:04:16.165 --> 01:04:17.834
Sounds familiar.

01:04:18.335 --> 01:04:20.420
Appetite for destruction?

01:04:20.629 --> 01:04:22.965
Contempt for the czars of fashion?

01:04:23.299 --> 01:04:25.134
Wait, don't tell me.

01:04:25.343 --> 01:04:27.261
Naked sexual charisma?

01:04:28.805 --> 01:04:30.056
Batman.

01:04:31.182 --> 01:04:33.434
The thorn in both our sides.

01:04:34.144 --> 01:04:36.188
The fly in our ointment.

01:04:36.814 --> 01:04:38.148
Ointment?

01:04:38.649 --> 01:04:41.027
I've got scented and unscented.

01:04:41.528 --> 01:04:43.321
I'll come back later.

01:04:43.822 --> 01:04:47.701
Perchance, are you a registered voter?
I'm a mayoral prospect.

01:04:47.867 --> 01:04:50.245
I have but one pet cause today:

01:04:51.205 --> 01:04:52.665
Ban the Bat.

01:04:53.165 --> 01:04:57.254
Oh, him again. No bother.
He's already history. Check it out.

01:04:57.963 --> 01:05:02.384
We'll disassemble his Batmobile
and turn it into an H-bomb on wheels.

01:05:05.887 --> 01:05:08.391
He'd have even more power as a martyr.

01:05:08.641 --> 01:05:13.105
To destroy Batman, we must first
turn him into what he hates the most.

01:05:13.731 --> 01:05:15.149
Namely, us.

01:05:17.067 --> 01:05:18.403
Frame him?

01:05:18.570 --> 01:05:21.739
Not even in office yet
and already an enemies list.

01:05:23.574 --> 01:05:26.202
Those names are not for prying eyes.

01:05:28.079 --> 01:05:30.875
Why should I trust some catbroad anyway?

01:05:32.084 --> 01:05:36.256
Maybe you're a screwed-up sorority chick
getting back at her daddy...

01:05:36.423 --> 01:05:39.967
...for not buying her that pony
when she turned sweet-sixteen.

01:05:57.196 --> 01:05:58.656
Nice birdie.

01:06:14.048 --> 01:06:15.466
Nice kitty.

01:06:15.967 --> 01:06:17.385
Nice kitty.

01:06:24.226 --> 01:06:26.229
Batman napalmed my arm.

01:06:26.813 --> 01:06:30.984
He knocked me off a building just
when I started to feel good about myself.

01:06:31.067 --> 01:06:34.237
I want to play an integral part
in his degradation.

01:06:38.409 --> 01:06:40.160
A plan is forming.

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:49.546
I want in.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:55.094
The thought of busting Batman
makes me feel all...

01:06:57.179 --> 01:06:58.265
...dirty.

01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:05.440
Maybe I'll just give myself a bath
right here.

01:07:16.327 --> 01:07:18.203
<i>I challenge the mayor...</i>

01:07:18.370 --> 01:07:22.208
<i>... to re-light the Christmas tree
in Gotham Plaza tomorrow night.</i>

01:07:23.376 --> 01:07:28.089
Sir, shall we change the channel
to a program with some dignity and class?

01:07:28.715 --> 01:07:30.968
<i>The Love Connection perhaps?</i>

01:07:33.387 --> 01:07:35.598
<i>... not that I have any faith in the mayor.</i>

01:07:35.681 --> 01:07:37.559
<i>But I hope and pray...</i>

01:07:37.893 --> 01:07:39.353
<i>... that Batman...</i>

01:07:39.519 --> 01:07:42.356
<i>... will be present to preserve the peace.</i>

01:07:43.690 --> 01:07:44.858
Subtle.

01:07:48.404 --> 01:07:50.365
Why are you doing this?

01:07:52.575 --> 01:07:53.744
Selina?

01:07:55.913 --> 01:07:58.249
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

01:07:58.416 --> 01:08:01.085
Scare me? I was just scaring myself.

01:08:01.919 --> 01:08:03.922
I don't see how, but...

01:08:04.214 --> 01:08:07.509
It's nice to see you in the real world,
away from Shreck.

01:08:09.052 --> 01:08:10.763
It's nice to be here.

01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:15.560
Are you all right?

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:20.691
You look like you have the holiday blues
or something.

01:08:23.568 --> 01:08:25.654
Boy, the news these days.

01:08:26.613 --> 01:08:27.615
Weird!

01:08:29.367 --> 01:08:32.496
I heard on TV that Catwoman
weighs 140 pounds.

01:08:34.622 --> 01:08:36.792
How do these hacks sleep at night?

01:08:36.959 --> 01:08:39.752
It's not even accurate. "Batman blows it"?

01:08:40.087 --> 01:08:43.133
He probably saved millions
in property damage alone.

01:08:44.426 --> 01:08:48.096
You're not going to the re-lighting
of the tree, are you?

01:08:48.305 --> 01:08:50.640
I wouldn't be caught dead there.

01:08:51.809 --> 01:08:55.104
It's going to be a hot time
in the cold town tonight.

01:08:57.148 --> 01:08:59.943
You got kind of a dark side, don't you?

01:09:00.611 --> 01:09:02.154
No darker than yours.

01:09:06.326 --> 01:09:09.621
Why don't you come over
and we can watch it on TV?

01:09:09.997 --> 01:09:12.165
The tree-lighting ceremony.

01:09:12.457 --> 01:09:15.335
I can't. I have to be somewhere tonight.

01:09:16.170 --> 01:09:18.631
How about coming for dinner at five?

01:09:18.796 --> 01:09:20.131
Let's say six?

01:09:21.301 --> 01:09:22.093
Five.

01:09:22.176 --> 01:09:23.636
Five. You and me.

01:09:31.310 --> 01:09:34.439
The tree lights up
and then I push the button.

01:09:34.774 --> 01:09:35.941
Wait, wait.

01:09:36.108 --> 01:09:39.071
I push the button, then the tree lights up.

01:09:41.365 --> 01:09:42.823
Who are you?

01:09:43.368 --> 01:09:44.868
Talent scout.

01:09:45.536 --> 01:09:46.828
Come in.

01:09:47.371 --> 01:09:50.457
I don't just light trees.
I'm an actress as well.

01:09:52.877 --> 01:09:55.798
What is that thing?
A camera or something?

01:09:56.465 --> 01:09:57.800
Say, "Cheese!"

01:09:59.552 --> 01:10:00.553
Cheese.

01:10:12.233 --> 01:10:13.484
Thanks, Alfred.

01:10:15.403 --> 01:10:17.656
I'm sure he's wonderful company...

01:10:17.823 --> 01:10:21.576
...but doesn't the "gold-plated-bachelor" bit
get a little stale?

01:10:22.828 --> 01:10:26.164
A lot like the "lonely-secretary" syndrome,
I guess.

01:10:26.748 --> 01:10:28.584
Executive Assistant.

01:10:28.835 --> 01:10:29.836
Sorry.

01:10:33.173 --> 01:10:34.508
Secretary.

01:10:39.014 --> 01:10:40.597
Any girlfriend?

01:10:43.434 --> 01:10:44.602
Sure.

01:10:45.854 --> 01:10:47.897
You mean, as in serious?

01:10:49.190 --> 01:10:51.068
No. Had one, didn't work.

01:10:51.444 --> 01:10:53.571
What went wrong? Hang on!

01:10:53.779 --> 01:10:55.198
I think I know!

01:10:55.699 --> 01:10:57.367
You kept things from her.

01:10:57.451 --> 01:10:59.076
I told her everything.

01:11:00.287 --> 01:11:01.955
The truth frightened her?

01:11:02.039 --> 01:11:04.041
There are two truths...

01:11:05.877 --> 01:11:07.211
...you know?

01:11:07.545 --> 01:11:10.965
She had trouble reconciling them
because I had trouble...

01:11:12.301 --> 01:11:13.886
...reconciling them.

01:11:17.890 --> 01:11:19.141
Vicki thought...

01:11:19.224 --> 01:11:20.225
Vicki?

01:11:21.393 --> 01:11:23.229
Ice skater or stewardess?

01:11:25.398 --> 01:11:27.734
No, she was a photojournalist.

01:11:28.986 --> 01:11:30.988
Was Vicki right about your...

01:11:31.155 --> 01:11:32.990
...difficulty with duality?

01:11:36.994 --> 01:11:38.245
You see...

01:11:39.164 --> 01:11:41.208
...if I say yes, then...

01:11:42.918 --> 01:11:45.088
...you'll think of me as a...

01:11:45.254 --> 01:11:48.049
...Norman Bates, a Ted Bundy type and...

01:11:56.433 --> 01:11:58.435
You might not let me kiss you.

01:12:01.272 --> 01:12:04.609
It's the so-called normal guys
who always let you down.

01:12:04.776 --> 01:12:07.947
Sickos never scare me.
At least they're committed.

01:12:48.074 --> 01:12:49.409
I can't do that.

01:12:49.576 --> 01:12:50.828
Neither can I.

01:12:50.953 --> 01:12:54.582
<i>This is a special bulletin.
The Ice Princess has been kidnapped.</i>

01:12:55.666 --> 01:12:59.880
<i>Can you confirm reports of Batman's
suspected involvement in the abduction?</i>

01:13:00.922 --> 01:13:03.675
<i>The evidence is purely circumstantial.</i>

01:13:04.051 --> 01:13:08.640
<i>This was found, stained with blood,
in the missing girl's dressing room.</i>

01:13:10.224 --> 01:13:12.644
- I must go.
- No, it's your house.

01:13:13.062 --> 01:13:16.607
Hold on. Just sit for a second and relax.
I'll be right back.

01:13:27.369 --> 01:13:29.580
I've got to go to the plaza.

01:13:29.747 --> 01:13:33.042
- He is begging me to show.
- I hoped you'd snub him.

01:13:33.209 --> 01:13:36.797
I can't. There's been a kidnapping.
Here's what I want you to do.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:37.880
Shit!

01:13:41.718 --> 01:13:44.888
Tell Selina, Ms. Kyle,
I had to go out of town.

01:13:46.099 --> 01:13:49.686
Tell her that a big business deal came up...
You know what?

01:13:50.228 --> 01:13:53.816
Let her know, not in some kind of dumb,
"be-my-girlfriend" way...

01:13:53.899 --> 01:13:55.733
I'll relay the message.

01:14:00.739 --> 01:14:03.368
Mr. Wayne told me to tell you that...

01:14:03.743 --> 01:14:05.161
Bruce, yes...

01:14:06.454 --> 01:14:08.332
Would you tell him...

01:14:08.582 --> 01:14:11.919
...l've been going through...
a lot of changes and...

01:14:13.921 --> 01:14:15.381
Just that...

01:14:15.589 --> 01:14:17.591
...this is not a rejection...

01:14:18.092 --> 01:14:19.803
...my abruptly leaving.

01:14:19.928 --> 01:14:22.347
In fact, he makes me feel the way...

01:14:22.931 --> 01:14:24.767
...I hope I really am.

01:14:26.477 --> 01:14:30.107
Could you just make up a sonnet or...
a dirty limerick?

01:14:30.774 --> 01:14:32.942
One has just sprung to mind.

01:14:34.277 --> 01:14:35.821
This way, ma'am.

01:15:37.057 --> 01:15:38.642
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen.</i>

01:15:38.892 --> 01:15:41.436
<i>Please, may I have your attention?</i>

01:15:43.814 --> 01:15:46.108
<i>I know that to many of you...</i>

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:49.487
<i>... Gotham seems a bit
beleaguered these days.</i>

01:15:50.154 --> 01:15:52.741
<i>But I want you to know
your elected officials...</i>

01:15:52.825 --> 01:15:54.910
<i>... and your police department...</i>

01:15:54.994 --> 01:15:57.579
<i>... have the situation well in hand.</i>

01:16:58.064 --> 01:16:59.149
Got to hurry.

01:16:59.232 --> 01:17:00.150
Thank you.

01:17:00.233 --> 01:17:02.069
It was set up to look like I did it.

01:17:02.152 --> 01:17:05.782
I'll tell the police I was kidnapped
by an ugly birdman with fish breath.

01:17:05.865 --> 01:17:07.533
Did somebody say fish?

01:17:07.784 --> 01:17:09.953
I haven't been fed all day.

01:17:10.788 --> 01:17:12.163
Eat floor.

01:17:13.706 --> 01:17:14.874
High fiber.

01:17:16.043 --> 01:17:17.378
Hey, stud...

01:17:17.544 --> 01:17:20.798
...I thought we had something together.
- We do.

01:17:36.774 --> 01:17:38.694
Got to go. Girl talk.

01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:10.771
She let me go. I think 'cause I reasoned
with her, girl-to-girl.

01:18:12.565 --> 01:18:14.608
Be careful. Don't move.

01:18:16.945 --> 01:18:18.321
Lawn dart!

01:18:22.410 --> 01:18:24.619
Rats with wings, do your thing.

01:18:31.127 --> 01:18:32.963
Batman pushed the Princess!

01:18:48.605 --> 01:18:49.899
Hold your fire!

01:19:04.915 --> 01:19:07.335
You're catnip to a girl like me.

01:19:08.586 --> 01:19:10.338
Handsome, dazed...

01:19:11.757 --> 01:19:13.509
...and to die for.

01:19:21.433 --> 01:19:23.937
Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it.

01:19:24.688 --> 01:19:26.189
But a kiss...

01:19:26.523 --> 01:19:29.110
...can be even deadlier if you mean it.

01:19:38.536 --> 01:19:41.456
You're the second man
who's killed me this week.

01:19:41.623 --> 01:19:43.625
But I've got seven lives left.

01:19:43.792 --> 01:19:45.253
I tried to save you...

01:19:45.336 --> 01:19:48.506
Seems like every woman
you try to save ends up dead.

01:19:48.881 --> 01:19:50.718
Or deeply resentful.

01:19:51.718 --> 01:19:53.636
Maybe you should retire.

01:20:16.620 --> 01:20:17.789
Damn.

01:20:52.953 --> 01:20:54.413
Outstanding!

01:20:55.122 --> 01:20:57.459
You're Beauty and the Beast...

01:20:57.959 --> 01:21:00.754
...in one luscious Christmas gift pack.

01:21:01.964 --> 01:21:04.383
You said you'd scare the Ice Princess.

01:21:04.466 --> 01:21:06.635
She looked pretty scared to me.

01:21:08.971 --> 01:21:10.807
A touch of the bubbly?

01:21:14.728 --> 01:21:16.814
So what are we waiting for?

01:21:17.022 --> 01:21:19.651
Let's consummate our fiendish union.

01:21:20.485 --> 01:21:21.652
What?

01:21:22.152 --> 01:21:23.612
Oh, come on.

01:21:24.155 --> 01:21:25.740
Can't you picture?

01:21:25.907 --> 01:21:28.076
It's dark in the mayor's mansion.

01:21:28.451 --> 01:21:31.706
I'm bushed, so here you come
into the bedroom...

01:21:32.915 --> 01:21:35.001
...twitching your little tail...

01:21:35.168 --> 01:21:38.504
...my slippers in one hand,
a dry martini in the other.

01:21:38.754 --> 01:21:39.839
Please.

01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:42.467
I wouldn't touch you to scratch you.

01:21:42.551 --> 01:21:46.889
You lousy minx! I should have you spayed!
You sent out all the signals!

01:21:47.515 --> 01:21:50.017
I don't think I like you anymore!

01:21:58.026 --> 01:22:00.070
Good-bye, my unintended.

01:22:00.571 --> 01:22:01.864
Go to heaven.

01:23:01.556 --> 01:23:02.766
There he is!

01:23:05.395 --> 01:23:07.146
<i>Don't adjust your sets.</i>

01:23:07.354 --> 01:23:08.648
<i>Welcome...</i>

01:23:08.898 --> 01:23:11.984
<i>... to the Oswald Cobblepot
School of Driving.</i>

01:23:13.361 --> 01:23:15.781
<i>Gentlemen, start your screaming.</i>

01:23:49.902 --> 01:23:54.032
<i>This may be a bad time to mention it,
but my license has expired!</i>

01:24:11.218 --> 01:24:12.219
<i>Relax.</i>

01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:16.892
<i>I'll take care of the squealing, wretched,
pinhead puppets of Gotham!</i>

01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:07.949
<i>You must admit I played this stinking city
like a harp from hell!</i>

01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:30.557
Helpless old lady at 12:00 high!

01:26:08.016 --> 01:26:09.267
That's funny.

01:26:18.028 --> 01:26:19.780
Now I'm a little worried.

01:26:46.684 --> 01:26:48.561
So he survived. Why worry?

01:26:48.728 --> 01:26:52.483
He didn't even lose a limb!
An eyeball! Bladder control!

01:26:53.359 --> 01:26:56.780
Listen to them. They've lost faith
in old symbols.

01:26:57.406 --> 01:27:00.409
They're ready to bond with you,
the icon of the future.

01:27:00.492 --> 01:27:02.411
If it works, don't fix it.

01:27:02.661 --> 01:27:05.122
We'll celebrate tonight at my annual ball.

01:27:05.205 --> 01:27:07.208
Shreck and Cobblepot...

01:27:07.834 --> 01:27:09.961
...the visionary alliance.

01:27:29.692 --> 01:27:31.527
<i>When it came time...</i>

01:27:31.861 --> 01:27:34.822
<i>... to ensure the safety of our fair city...</i>

01:27:36.365 --> 01:27:38.659
<i>... did the mayor have a plan?</i>

01:27:39.536 --> 01:27:40.620
<i>No!</i>

01:27:42.122 --> 01:27:43.915
<i>He relied on a man.</i>

01:27:45.877 --> 01:27:47.211
<i>A Batman.</i>

01:27:48.212 --> 01:27:51.133
<i>A ticking time-bomb of a costumed freak...</i>

01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:55.554
Our prime concern is
this ghastly grotesque.

01:27:56.221 --> 01:27:59.391
But let's not forget about
repairing the Batmobile.

01:27:59.641 --> 01:28:01.603
There's security to consider.

01:28:01.895 --> 01:28:04.856
We can't just take it to any old body shop.

01:28:05.982 --> 01:28:07.067
Security?

01:28:07.318 --> 01:28:09.570
Who let Vicki Vale into the Batcave?

01:28:09.653 --> 01:28:13.991
I'm working, I turn around and there she is.
"Hi, Vick. Come on in."

01:28:23.419 --> 01:28:25.713
- Ready?
- I'll take the stairs.

01:28:47.403 --> 01:28:50.323
<i>You ask... am I up here for personal glory?</i>

01:28:52.868 --> 01:28:53.953
<i>No.</i>

01:29:06.883 --> 01:29:09.637
<i>The glory that I yearn to recapture...</i>

01:29:10.888 --> 01:29:13.016
<i>... is the glory of Gotham!</i>

01:29:31.162 --> 01:29:33.456
<i>How can this be accomplished?</i>

01:29:35.876 --> 01:29:37.210
<i>I know...</i>

01:29:37.419 --> 01:29:39.462
<i>... you're all concerned.</i>

01:29:41.923 --> 01:29:43.133
<i>Relax.</i>

01:29:43.759 --> 01:29:48.181
<i>I'll take care of the squealing, wretched,
pinhead puppets of Gotham.</i>

01:29:55.647 --> 01:29:57.232
I didn't say that.

01:29:59.610 --> 01:30:02.697
<i>You must admit I played
this stinking city...</i>

01:30:03.782 --> 01:30:05.867
<i>... like a harp from hell!</i>

01:30:07.619 --> 01:30:09.038
<i>You must admit...</i>

01:30:09.205 --> 01:30:12.708
<i>... I played this stinking city
like a harp from hell!</i>

01:31:06.102 --> 01:31:10.022
Why is there always someone who brings
eggs and tomatoes to a speech?

01:31:34.008 --> 01:31:35.468
There he is!

01:32:07.045 --> 01:32:08.421
My babies.

01:32:09.715 --> 01:32:11.383
Did you miss me?

01:32:25.398 --> 01:32:27.068
Did you miss me?

01:32:28.736 --> 01:32:30.613
Great speech, Oswald.

01:32:31.865 --> 01:32:33.784
My name is not Oswald!

01:32:34.409 --> 01:32:35.911
It's Penguin!

01:32:36.203 --> 01:32:38.205
I am not a human being!

01:32:38.580 --> 01:32:40.916
I am an animal. Cold-blooded!

01:32:42.376 --> 01:32:43.962
Crank the A.C.!

01:32:44.170 --> 01:32:46.965
Where are my lists? Bring me the names!

01:32:48.008 --> 01:32:49.385
It's time.

01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:53.557
These are the names of the first-born sons
of Gotham City.

01:32:54.182 --> 01:32:55.850
Just like I was.

01:32:56.267 --> 01:32:59.271
And like me, a terrible fate waits for them.

01:33:01.106 --> 01:33:03.817
Tonight, while their parents party...

01:33:04.442 --> 01:33:06.779
...they'll be dreaming away...

01:33:07.196 --> 01:33:09.282
...in their safe cribs...

01:33:09.532 --> 01:33:11.410
...their soft beds...

01:33:11.785 --> 01:33:13.953
...and we'll snatch them...

01:33:14.120 --> 01:33:16.123
...carry them into the sewer...

01:33:16.290 --> 01:33:19.585
...and toss them into a deep, dark,
watery grave.

01:33:21.629 --> 01:33:22.797
Penguin?

01:33:23.548 --> 01:33:25.800
Killing sleeping children...

01:33:26.134 --> 01:33:27.887
...isn't that a little...

01:33:38.148 --> 01:33:39.733
No, it's a lot.

01:33:49.702 --> 01:33:51.037
A reminder.

01:33:51.204 --> 01:33:55.209
Tonight is that loathsome party hosted
by the odious Mr. Shreck.

01:33:55.542 --> 01:33:58.378
May we RSVP
in the resoundingly negative?

01:33:59.087 --> 01:34:00.381
Not interested.

01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:03.802
Although...

01:34:06.137 --> 01:34:08.223
...Selina Kyle might be there.

01:34:31.499 --> 01:34:33.252
Ingenious costume.

01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:35.170
Let me guess.

01:34:35.337 --> 01:34:37.339
Trust-fund goody-goody?

01:34:38.675 --> 01:34:40.093
Feeling good?

01:34:41.094 --> 01:34:44.514
You almost made a monster the mayor
of Gotham City.

01:34:44.931 --> 01:34:47.267
I am the light of this city...

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:50.104
...and I am its mean, twisted soul.

01:34:50.521 --> 01:34:52.273
Does it matter who's mayor?

01:34:52.356 --> 01:34:53.566
It does to me.

01:34:53.941 --> 01:34:55.110
Yawn.

01:35:33.402 --> 01:35:35.821
I'm sorry about yesterday, but I had...

01:35:35.946 --> 01:35:39.409
...a pretty big deal come through.
Fall through, actually.

01:35:39.576 --> 01:35:42.454
It's okay. I had to go home
and feed my cat.

01:35:51.423 --> 01:35:53.090
No hard feelings then?

01:35:55.594 --> 01:35:57.012
Actually...

01:35:59.139 --> 01:36:01.059
...semi-hard, I'd say.

01:36:07.274 --> 01:36:10.777
There's a big, comfy California King
over in Bedding.

01:36:12.321 --> 01:36:13.989
Why don't we...

01:36:15.115 --> 01:36:16.992
Take off our costumes?

01:36:20.497 --> 01:36:22.666
I'm tired of wearing masks.

01:36:23.501 --> 01:36:24.752
Me too.

01:36:26.170 --> 01:36:27.922
Let me ask you something.

01:36:29.173 --> 01:36:30.883
Why'd you come tonight?

01:36:31.509 --> 01:36:33.511
- You first.
- To see you.

01:36:35.973 --> 01:36:36.974
Lovely.

01:36:38.642 --> 01:36:41.896
I wish I could say the same,
but I came for Max.

01:36:44.858 --> 01:36:46.484
Do you mean you...

01:36:46.818 --> 01:36:48.194
Not you and Max?

01:36:49.654 --> 01:36:51.073
Me and Max?

01:36:57.664 --> 01:36:59.416
No. This and Max.

01:37:02.670 --> 01:37:06.798
Don't tell me killing Max
won't solve anything, because it will.

01:37:07.884 --> 01:37:11.220
Aren't you tired of this
sanctimonious robber baron...

01:37:11.387 --> 01:37:14.308
...coming out on top when
he should be six feet under?

01:37:14.391 --> 01:37:18.563
You may have problems with your boss,
but who do you think you are?

01:37:21.565 --> 01:37:23.818
I don't know anymore, Bruce.

01:37:38.335 --> 01:37:40.504
A kiss under the mistletoe.

01:37:43.757 --> 01:37:45.927
"Mistletoe can be deadly if you eat it."

01:37:46.010 --> 01:37:48.262
"But a kiss can be even deadlier...

01:37:50.765 --> 01:37:52.309
"...if you mean it."

01:38:02.612 --> 01:38:04.030
Oh, my God.

01:38:04.948 --> 01:38:07.492
Does this mean we have to start fighting?

01:38:08.536 --> 01:38:10.120
Let's go outside.

01:38:45.994 --> 01:38:48.080
- Are you okay?
- I'm all right.

01:38:56.255 --> 01:38:58.175
You didn't invite me...

01:38:58.425 --> 01:39:00.093
...so I crashed!

01:39:03.639 --> 01:39:04.724
What do you want?

01:39:04.807 --> 01:39:06.642
Right now, my troops...

01:39:06.893 --> 01:39:09.145
...are fanning out across town...

01:39:09.395 --> 01:39:11.230
...for your children!

01:39:11.522 --> 01:39:12.523
Yes!

01:39:12.690 --> 01:39:14.776
For your first-born sons!

01:39:15.527 --> 01:39:18.405
The ones you left defenseless at home...

01:39:18.697 --> 01:39:21.034
...so you could dress up like jerks...

01:39:21.117 --> 01:39:23.244
...get juiced and dance...

01:39:24.037 --> 01:39:25.372
...badly!

01:39:29.959 --> 01:39:31.962
I've personally come...

01:39:32.546 --> 01:39:34.924
...for Gotham's favorite son...

01:39:35.132 --> 01:39:36.927
...Mr. Chip Shreck.

01:39:38.136 --> 01:39:40.847
You're coming with me,
you Great White Dope...

01:39:41.807 --> 01:39:44.142
...to die, way down in the sewer!

01:39:44.809 --> 01:39:48.606
Not Chip. If you have any human feeling,
take me instead.

01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:52.610
I don't. So, no!

01:39:53.070 --> 01:39:54.363
I'm the one you want.

01:39:54.446 --> 01:39:57.950
Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated
and betrayed you?

01:39:58.493 --> 01:40:00.578
Isn't it Max, not Chip...

01:40:01.162 --> 01:40:04.666
...you want to see immersed
to his eyeballs in raw sewage?

01:40:09.672 --> 01:40:11.423
Okay, you got a point.

01:40:11.757 --> 01:40:14.510
I'll let the little prince live, for now.

01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:15.971
In the duck!

01:40:43.459 --> 01:40:45.628
This is going to be good...

01:40:46.379 --> 01:40:50.134
...to cut down a whole crop
of Gotham's most promising...

01:40:51.218 --> 01:40:52.887
...before their prime.

01:40:55.222 --> 01:40:57.808
You ask me... how do I lure them in?

01:41:01.938 --> 01:41:04.316
A little "Pied Penguin" action.

01:41:06.903 --> 01:41:09.405
And you get to watch them sink...

01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:12.075
...into a deep puddle...

01:41:12.242 --> 01:41:14.785
...of your industrial by-products.

01:41:15.621 --> 01:41:16.747
Then...

01:41:16.955 --> 01:41:18.582
...you join them.

01:41:52.453 --> 01:41:55.040
Hurry up and get those kids loaded.

01:42:04.634 --> 01:42:06.636
Right this way, kiddies.

01:42:07.178 --> 01:42:08.680
Come with me.

01:42:25.156 --> 01:42:27.493
So where are all the children?

01:42:31.497 --> 01:42:32.833
"Dear Penguin:

01:42:33.041 --> 01:42:36.169
"The children regret
they're unable to attend.

01:42:36.712 --> 01:42:38.046
"Batman!"

01:42:51.562 --> 01:42:53.355
My dear penguins...

01:42:54.732 --> 01:42:57.235
...we stand on a great threshold!

01:42:58.695 --> 01:43:00.697
It's okay to be scared!

01:43:01.364 --> 01:43:03.867
Many of you won't be coming back.

01:43:04.242 --> 01:43:06.037
Thanks to Batman...

01:43:06.704 --> 01:43:08.539
...the time has come...

01:43:08.748 --> 01:43:11.167
...to punish all God's children!

01:43:12.669 --> 01:43:15.547
First-, second-, third- and fourth-born!

01:43:16.340 --> 01:43:17.883
Why be biased?

01:43:18.175 --> 01:43:19.843
Male and female!

01:43:20.594 --> 01:43:22.847
Hell, the sexes are equal...

01:43:23.765 --> 01:43:26.017
...with their erogenous zones...

01:43:26.184 --> 01:43:27.936
...blown sky-high!

01:43:30.856 --> 01:43:32.024
Forward...

01:43:33.359 --> 01:43:34.528
...march!

01:43:34.945 --> 01:43:37.112
The liberation of Gotham...

01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:39.783
...has begun!

01:44:24.917 --> 01:44:27.253
<i>The penguins are moving above ground.</i>

01:44:52.615 --> 01:44:54.116
<i>Penguin army...</i>

01:44:54.283 --> 01:44:57.621
<i>... approaching launch destination
at Gotham Plaza.</i>

01:44:58.955 --> 01:45:01.082
<i>One minute until ignition.</i>

01:45:01.625 --> 01:45:03.920
They wouldn't put me on a pedestal...

01:45:04.085 --> 01:45:06.504
...so I'm laying them on a slab!

01:45:07.757 --> 01:45:10.509
<i>Penguins seem to be converging
on Gotham Plaza.</i>

01:45:33.744 --> 01:45:35.872
<i>Thirty seconds until ignition.</i>

01:45:37.832 --> 01:45:40.376
<i>Estimated casualties after launch:</i>

01:45:41.503 --> 01:45:43.088
<i>100,000 people.</i>

01:45:46.509 --> 01:45:49.303
<i>The penguins have reached
Gotham Square.</i>

01:46:08.701 --> 01:46:10.703
<i>Fifteen seconds to ignition.</i>

01:46:13.289 --> 01:46:15.000
Ready when you are, sir.

01:46:17.793 --> 01:46:19.546
I've got the coordinates.

01:46:27.388 --> 01:46:29.098
Let's turn them around.

01:46:37.649 --> 01:46:39.151
<i>Something is wrong.</i>

01:46:40.903 --> 01:46:42.989
<i>Something has jammed the signal.</i>

01:46:53.250 --> 01:46:55.628
<i>They seem to be turning around.</i>

01:47:26.704 --> 01:47:29.582
<i>There is also something coming this way.</i>

01:47:30.541 --> 01:47:32.544
<i>Very large. Very fast.</i>

01:47:48.813 --> 01:47:50.147
Who's there?

01:47:57.406 --> 01:47:59.742
I'm homing in on the signal's origin.

01:49:15.786 --> 01:49:18.872
You're jealous
because I'm a genuine freak...

01:49:19.206 --> 01:49:21.459
...and you have to wear a mask!

01:49:21.709 --> 01:49:23.378
You might be right.

01:49:25.964 --> 01:49:29.927
But what it all comes down to is:
Who's holding the umbrella?

01:49:56.415 --> 01:49:57.791
My babies!

01:51:34.484 --> 01:51:38.821
I don't know what you want,
but I can get it with a minimum of fuss.

01:51:40.991 --> 01:51:42.158
Money.

01:51:42.492 --> 01:51:43.493
Jewels.

01:51:43.785 --> 01:51:45.788
A very big ball of string.

01:51:50.252 --> 01:51:51.920
Your blood, Max.

01:51:52.129 --> 01:51:53.713
I gave at the office.

01:51:54.130 --> 01:51:56.300
A half-pint. I'm talking gallons.

01:51:56.675 --> 01:51:58.135
Let's make a deal!

01:51:58.302 --> 01:52:00.429
Other than my blood, what can I do?

01:52:00.512 --> 01:52:02.807
Sorry, Max. A die for a die.

01:52:14.028 --> 01:52:16.405
You're not just saving a life...

01:52:16.530 --> 01:52:18.575
Shut up. You're going to jail.

01:52:19.284 --> 01:52:23.539
Don't be naive. The law doesn't
apply to people like him... or us.

01:52:24.123 --> 01:52:25.708
Wrong on both counts.

01:52:35.802 --> 01:52:36.970
Why do this?

01:52:40.975 --> 01:52:43.144
Let's just take him to the police.

01:52:44.729 --> 01:52:46.440
Then we can go home...

01:52:47.649 --> 01:52:48.816
...together.

01:52:54.865 --> 01:52:55.950
Selina...

01:52:59.162 --> 01:53:00.830
...don't you see?

01:53:01.958 --> 01:53:03.250
We're the same.

01:53:05.669 --> 01:53:07.087
We're the same.

01:53:08.798 --> 01:53:09.882
Split...

01:53:10.299 --> 01:53:11.801
...down the center.

01:53:33.367 --> 01:53:34.618
Please.

01:53:35.870 --> 01:53:37.038
Bruce...

01:53:37.872 --> 01:53:41.042
...I would love to live with you
in your castle...

01:53:43.545 --> 01:53:46.299
...forever, just like in a fairy tale.

01:53:52.055 --> 01:53:55.851
I just couldn't live with myself.
Don't pretend this is a happy ending.

01:53:58.562 --> 01:53:59.813
Selina Kyle.

01:54:01.315 --> 01:54:02.734
You're fired.

01:54:03.151 --> 01:54:04.736
And Bruce Wayne...

01:54:05.236 --> 01:54:07.071
...why are you dressed up like Batman?

01:54:07.155 --> 01:54:09.575
Because he is Batman, you moron!

01:54:10.951 --> 01:54:12.036
Was.

01:54:14.623 --> 01:54:15.582
Don't.

01:54:15.748 --> 01:54:19.377
You killed me, the Penguin killed me,
Batman killed me.

01:54:19.919 --> 01:54:22.964
Three lives down.
Got enough to finish me off?

01:54:23.048 --> 01:54:24.592
One way to find out.

01:54:28.179 --> 01:54:29.180
Four.

01:54:29.430 --> 01:54:30.599
Five.

01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:35.269
Still alive!

01:54:44.948 --> 01:54:46.032
Six.

01:54:46.199 --> 01:54:47.284
Seven.

01:54:47.493 --> 01:54:49.745
All good girls go to heaven.

01:54:56.210 --> 01:54:57.796
Two lives left.

01:55:00.048 --> 01:55:02.550
I'll save one for next Christmas.

01:55:04.971 --> 01:55:06.889
But in the meantime...

01:55:08.725 --> 01:55:10.893
...how about a kiss, Santie Claus?

01:56:42.079 --> 01:56:43.247
Shit!

01:56:43.581 --> 01:56:45.416
I picked a cute one.

01:56:48.921 --> 01:56:51.006
The heat's getting to me.

01:56:51.924 --> 01:56:54.177
I'll murder you momentarily.

01:56:56.470 --> 01:56:57.930
But first...

01:56:58.681 --> 01:57:00.767
...I need a cool drink...

01:57:01.476 --> 01:57:03.144
...of ice water.

01:58:45.176 --> 01:58:46.511
Stop the car.

02:00:07.519 --> 02:00:09.188
Come what may...

02:00:09.605 --> 02:00:11.606
...Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.

02:00:12.608 --> 02:00:14.360
Merry Christmas, Alfred.

02:00:16.111 --> 02:00:17.781
Goodwill toward men.

02:00:20.450 --> 02:00:21.701
And women.
