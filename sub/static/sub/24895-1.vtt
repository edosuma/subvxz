08:42.366 --> 08:45.433
(gentle piano music)

08:55.933 --> 08:57.200
- [Ella] Kevin.

08:58.433 --> 08:59.433
Kevin!

08:59.433 --> 09:00.333
- Yeah?

09:00.334 --> 09:02.067
- What are you doing?

09:03.233 --> 09:04.899
- I've been doing some research,

09:04.900 --> 09:06.366
hear me out here.

09:06.367 --> 09:08.432
See this is what I think,

09:08.433 --> 09:11.532
see how you can see the
Empire State building there?

09:11.533 --> 09:14.232
Do you notice how you can
see all of those buildings

09:14.233 --> 09:15.966
all the way in the distance?

09:15.967 --> 09:17.932
You know up Madison
Avenue there?

09:17.933 --> 09:19.132
- Yeah?

09:19.133 --> 09:21.732
- Okay, well I feel
like since I can see all

09:21.733 --> 09:24.066
of those buildings, not just
the Empire State building,

09:24.067 --> 09:27.499
but like literally all of them
all the way in the distance

09:27.500 --> 09:28.567
from the sidewalk up,

09:29.667 --> 09:31.187
there's only one
conclusion I can make.

09:31.211 --> 09:33.211
- And that would be?

09:35.233 --> 09:36.500
- That the earth is flat.

09:37.933 --> 09:39.366
- Oh Jesus!

09:39.367 --> 09:42.899
- I'm serious I mean there
should be some sort of curvature

09:42.900 --> 09:43.967
there, some drop-off.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.600
It only makes sense,
scientifically and...

09:48.667 --> 09:49.866
- Zip it.

09:49.867 --> 09:52.566
Kevin, I don't care
what you think,

09:52.567 --> 09:54.099
where the Madison
Avenue has a curve,

09:54.100 --> 09:57.432
the buildings go sideways,
flat, forwards, whatever,

09:57.433 --> 10:00.832
the earth is round,
it's always been round.

10:00.833 --> 10:02.932
Check your information.

10:02.933 --> 10:06.332
- Okay wait, look way down
there in the distance,

10:06.333 --> 10:10.132
the Freedom Tower, the former
site of the Twin Towers.

10:10.133 --> 10:13.332
Anyways, scientists have
confirmed that no matter

10:13.333 --> 10:15.499
where the sun was in
the sky during the day,

10:15.500 --> 10:18.699
the towers would never cast
a shadow on each other,

10:18.700 --> 10:21.266
it was just magical.

10:21.267 --> 10:22.267
- You know what?

10:23.000 --> 10:24.932
Before you open up your mouth,

10:24.933 --> 10:26.832
make sure you confirm
with me the topic

10:26.833 --> 10:29.132
of your conversation, okay?

10:29.133 --> 10:30.133
- I just...

10:31.000 --> 10:32.200
- It's not negotiable.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.332
Can we get outta here?

10:36.333 --> 10:38.373
And can we also find somebody
else to hang out with?

10:38.397 --> 10:40.632
Kevin is a complete basket-case,

10:40.633 --> 10:42.866
I mean don't you know
any like really cool hot

10:42.867 --> 10:45.732
soho guys who would crash
a party or something?

10:45.733 --> 10:48.233
- Yeah, I'll get right on
that, find hot gay guys.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.199
- Are you listening to me

10:52.200 --> 10:54.800
or are you just whisking
me away with your words?

10:55.900 --> 10:56.900
- Both.

10:58.167 --> 10:59.832
- What are you doing?

10:59.833 --> 11:01.166
- What?

11:01.167 --> 11:02.927
- What are you doing?
- What are you reading?

11:03.800 --> 11:06.066
- This is an encyclopedia
of the serial killers

11:06.067 --> 11:07.266
of New York State.

11:07.267 --> 11:10.266
- Oh God, what did I
do to deserve this?

11:10.267 --> 11:12.066
I'm hanging out with a reject

11:12.067 --> 11:14.332
and the walking dead over here.

11:14.333 --> 11:16.266
- If I had any respect for you,

11:16.267 --> 11:19.099
I would take offense
to that, skank.

11:19.100 --> 11:20.967
- Skank? Skank?

11:22.367 --> 11:25.832
I'm not the one whose mom
named me Tiffani with an "I",

11:25.833 --> 11:27.513
I mean shouldn't you
be stripping somewhere

11:27.514 --> 11:28.913
in maybe some
black lingerie or...

11:28.914 --> 11:31.066
- Ella, drop it.

11:31.067 --> 11:32.366
You're just lonely and horny.

11:32.367 --> 11:34.499
Why don't you go hook up
with Kevin over there?

11:34.500 --> 11:36.266
You're both recently single.

11:36.267 --> 11:37.600
- Ewww, Kevin?

11:39.300 --> 11:41.066
All right.

11:41.067 --> 11:43.066
All right Kevin boy,

11:43.067 --> 11:44.599
here we are.

11:44.600 --> 11:47.666
It looks like you two
with me this weekend,

11:47.667 --> 11:49.307
and I'll tell you what
we're not gonna do,

11:49.308 --> 11:51.040
we're not gonna dick
around here anymore,

11:51.041 --> 11:53.467
so why don't you try to keep up.

11:58.767 --> 12:01.767
(eerie piano music)

12:51.300 --> 12:54.067
(train bustling)

13:08.133 --> 13:11.099
(traffic)

13:11.100 --> 13:12.500
- Let's just get outta here.

13:13.833 --> 13:15.366
- Let's just get outta where?

13:15.367 --> 13:17.533
- The city, just
for a couple days.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.833
- Yes! And go where?

13:21.733 --> 13:23.066
- Upstate.

13:23.067 --> 13:24.866
My friend gave me this
good connect for an.

13:24.867 --> 13:27.467
I-stay bed and breakfast
house in Swamp Hollow.

13:28.400 --> 13:29.866
- Swamp Hollow?

13:29.867 --> 13:32.699
No fucking way, that town
keeps popping up in this book

13:32.700 --> 13:33.932
all the time.

13:33.933 --> 13:36.932
That place is ripe with
murders and murderers.

13:36.933 --> 13:38.232
- Oh great choice, Kevin.

13:38.233 --> 13:41.399
- I mean, I didn't
know about all that,

13:41.400 --> 13:44.266
just thought it would be
fun for the three of us.

13:44.267 --> 13:46.599
- I think it's a fun
idea buddy 'ol pal.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.232
I can't think of a
better idea myself.

13:49.233 --> 13:50.732
We'll go upstate for a few days,

13:50.733 --> 13:53.499
explore all the sites of the
famous murders and murderers,

13:53.500 --> 13:54.500
it'll be a blast.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.367
- (laughs) You make
it sound so relaxing.

13:59.600 --> 14:01.800
- Come on, don't puss out on us.

14:03.367 --> 14:06.133
- All right guys, the one
thing I don't do is puss out.

14:08.533 --> 14:09.733
Fine, let's do it.

14:12.067 --> 14:13.532
- Okay great.

14:13.533 --> 14:15.373
Just hold on a second
and let me call my friend

14:15.397 --> 14:16.332
and set this up.

14:16.333 --> 14:17.333
I'm excited!

14:26.600 --> 14:29.066
- Listen, I'm all up for
going to the country,

14:29.067 --> 14:34.067
and maybe possibly seeing
some really cute country boys.

14:34.933 --> 14:36.299
But, do we have to take Kevin?

14:36.300 --> 14:37.500
He's such a dweeb.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.433
- All guys are
gross most the time.

14:41.600 --> 14:42.932
- Yeah I know but...

14:42.933 --> 14:44.933
- [Tiffani] But, he
is cute sometimes,

14:46.167 --> 14:48.099
when he's not being annoying,

14:48.100 --> 14:49.366
which is hardly ever.

14:49.367 --> 14:50.599
- Hardly.

14:50.600 --> 14:54.099
- But, it does seem like
he has a house connect

14:54.100 --> 14:56.199
and if we don't offer him money,

14:56.200 --> 14:58.667
he'll probably be too
chicken shit to ask for it.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.732
- [Ella] Free ride?

15:01.733 --> 15:03.167
- You bet your ass free ride.

15:04.467 --> 15:07.066
- All right, but if
he ruins things man,

15:07.067 --> 15:09.699
we may as well just get our
own ticket and go our own way,

15:09.700 --> 15:10.700
seriously.

15:13.633 --> 15:17.432
- Okay, we all good,
we got the place.

15:17.433 --> 15:19.432
Check-in is tonight.

15:19.433 --> 15:20.953
- Perfect, let's try
to make the train.

15:20.977 --> 15:23.199
I had to start working
on the itinerary.

15:23.200 --> 15:26.133
So many murder sites
to see, so little time.

15:27.600 --> 15:30.533
(traffic bustling)

15:35.200 --> 15:36.800
- [Train Attendant]
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:36.824 --> 15:38.899
if you are not exiting
at the next station

15:38.900 --> 15:42.866
please move away from the doors
and allow exiting customers

15:42.867 --> 15:44.832
to leave the train quickly.

15:44.833 --> 15:46.299
Thank you for your cooperation.

15:46.300 --> 15:48.499
- [Ella] Would you put that
thing down for a second?

15:48.500 --> 15:50.580
- [Tiffani] Butcher Bill is
one of the most notorious

15:50.604 --> 15:53.299
of serial killers in the
greater New York region

15:53.300 --> 15:55.666
with a body count
totaling over 35

15:55.667 --> 15:57.532
that the authorities know of.

15:57.533 --> 15:59.066
It's not that he
killed that many

15:59.067 --> 16:01.166
but the way in which he did so.

16:01.167 --> 16:03.766
Most of Bills victims were
missing men and women.

16:03.767 --> 16:06.432
Runaways, hookers, you name it.

16:06.433 --> 16:08.132
He would snatch 'em
up off the street

16:08.133 --> 16:09.899
then transport them
to his barn compound

16:09.900 --> 16:12.132
where he proceeded
to torture and kill

16:12.133 --> 16:14.199
with various pieces
of farm equipment,

16:14.200 --> 16:17.566
even parts of one victim
were found inside freshly

16:17.567 --> 16:19.066
made bales of hay.

16:19.067 --> 16:19.867
- Hookers in the hay?

16:19.868 --> 16:22.766
And you call me a freak.

16:22.767 --> 16:24.733
Now that guy sounds
like a super freak,

16:25.667 --> 16:27.366
he's super freaky.

16:27.367 --> 16:30.399
- Okay, you two are a
different level of freak,

16:30.400 --> 16:34.732
and by the way, one is not
better than the other, trust me.

16:34.733 --> 16:36.733
- There are like three
different murder sites alone

16:36.757 --> 16:39.232
right in the neighborhood
were we'll be staying,

16:39.233 --> 16:41.899
including our friend
Butcher Bill's barn.

16:41.900 --> 16:43.660
We're definitely checking
out all three sites

16:43.684 --> 16:46.232
and taking selfies to document.

16:46.233 --> 16:48.799
- Oh my God, what have
I gotten myself into?

16:48.800 --> 16:50.399
A weekend of this shit?

16:50.400 --> 16:51.667
- Did someone say selfie?

16:52.600 --> 16:55.100
Selfie time, yes.

17:01.067 --> 17:03.700
(camera clicks)

17:14.067 --> 17:15.267
Our chariot awaits.

17:16.267 --> 17:17.900
- Oh my God,

17:19.067 --> 17:20.900
- you have got to be...
- be shitting me.

17:22.767 --> 17:24.867
- Howdy city folk,
how was the ride up?

17:26.633 --> 17:29.167
- In retrospect, luxurious.

17:30.367 --> 17:32.432
- Well, she may not
be much to look at,

17:32.433 --> 17:34.867
but old Betsy here will
get us where we need to go.

17:38.600 --> 17:41.500
(trunk slams shut)

17:42.733 --> 17:46.233
(deep, dark, eerie music)

17:49.812 --> 17:51.732
- What brings y'all all
the way up to these parts

17:51.733 --> 17:53.966
I mean, why would you come here?

17:53.967 --> 17:57.699
- Well for one, we're bored
out of our fucking minds,

17:57.700 --> 17:59.566
but from the looks of this,

17:59.567 --> 18:02.100
I honestly don't think this
was the brightest idea.

18:03.533 --> 18:06.499
- Actually, what my friend
here is trying to say is

18:06.500 --> 18:09.466
this town is filled with
such a rich history.

18:09.467 --> 18:12.432
We couldn't help but be drawn
to experience it first-hand,

18:12.433 --> 18:14.632
There's no place we'd rather be.

18:14.633 --> 18:16.066
- History?

18:16.067 --> 18:18.187
I'm not aware of much of
anything goin' on around here

18:18.211 --> 18:19.811
to be makin' any
kind of history.

18:21.167 --> 18:22.966
- Serial killers.

18:22.967 --> 18:25.832
The history of serial killers.

18:25.833 --> 18:28.500
Apparently you guys in
this town are trying to

18:29.433 --> 18:30.932
corner the market.

18:30.933 --> 18:32.666
- [Driver] I don't know what
you all heard about this town,

18:32.667 --> 18:33.966
but that kinda stuff,

18:33.967 --> 18:35.966
killin' and all,

18:35.967 --> 18:38.399
that happens everywhere,
not just here.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.240
You're talkin' about
Butcher Bill and the likes

18:40.264 --> 18:41.264
of him I reckon.

18:41.600 --> 18:44.400
Well, he's done long gone

18:45.800 --> 18:47.733
down in the penitentiary,
rottin' away.

18:48.633 --> 18:50.266
We all good people up here now.

18:50.267 --> 18:52.700
Besides, it wasn't
always Bills fault.

18:54.833 --> 18:56.866
Sometimes them whores

18:56.867 --> 18:58.200
be comin' in from the city,

18:59.367 --> 19:01.966
be comin' up, stirring
up all sorts of trouble.

19:01.967 --> 19:05.333
Trouble that makes it
hard to stay out of.

19:06.533 --> 19:08.699
- Hey fuck-face, what're
you fuckin' lookin' at?

19:08.700 --> 19:09.567
(engine blows)

19:09.567 --> 19:10.400
- Oh shit!

19:10.401 --> 19:13.067
(car screeches)

19:19.467 --> 19:20.800
- Pop the trunk.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.667
Today, pop the trunk.

19:26.900 --> 19:30.266
Kevin, how far is
it to the house?

19:30.267 --> 19:31.899
- It's about another

19:31.900 --> 19:33.740
two miles straight down
the road it looks like.

19:33.764 --> 19:35.164
- I said to pop the trunk!

19:40.067 --> 19:41.067
Today!

19:47.167 --> 19:50.067
I don't know about you
guys, but we walk from here.

19:58.300 --> 20:00.333
- No charge, 'till next time.

20:02.367 --> 20:03.367
Be safe.

20:08.300 --> 20:12.067
(deep, dark, eerie rumbling)

20:16.800 --> 20:18.599
- What a whack job.

20:18.600 --> 20:19.832
I mean seriously,

20:19.833 --> 20:21.673
if this trip is gonna be
nothin' ut hanging out

20:21.697 --> 20:23.132
with crazies like these,

20:23.133 --> 20:26.133
I am takin' the next train
back to the city pronto.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.432
- He was harmless.

20:28.433 --> 20:30.299
I mean, can you blame him?

20:30.300 --> 20:31.999
You do have really nice legs,

20:32.000 --> 20:34.432
and your dress is really short,

20:34.433 --> 20:36.366
and your boobs are really nice,

20:36.367 --> 20:38.166
and they are
practically hanging out.

20:38.167 --> 20:39.167
- Oooh!

20:41.833 --> 20:44.432
- Don't worry, the women
are in charge this weekend,

20:44.433 --> 20:47.666
and besides, aren't
you guys excited to see

20:47.667 --> 20:49.299
some of the actual sites

20:49.300 --> 20:51.500
of some of the greatest
murders of all time?

20:53.500 --> 20:55.066
- Okay,

20:55.067 --> 20:57.533
you need help, the
both of you, all right?

20:58.700 --> 21:02.066
Oh, and by the way,
try to catch up.

21:02.067 --> 21:03.067
It's getting dark.

21:08.233 --> 21:10.833
(creepy music)

21:12.333 --> 21:13.666
Whoa,

21:13.667 --> 21:16.900
this place is creepy!

21:19.067 --> 21:20.767
- Yeah, sure is.

21:21.733 --> 21:23.399
Isn't it awesome?

21:23.400 --> 21:25.332
(Ella laughs)

21:25.333 --> 21:27.700
- [Tiffani] You think it's open?

21:34.300 --> 21:35.566
- Here, come this way.

21:35.567 --> 21:37.600
They said there's a key
in the front somewhere.

21:39.133 --> 21:42.233
(creepy, dark music)

21:54.667 --> 21:58.833
- Well, here we are
in front of the house.

22:01.567 --> 22:04.599
- Oh, real secure, leave
the key right in the corner.

22:04.600 --> 22:08.432
- It's the country, what
could possibly happen up here?

22:08.433 --> 22:10.500
- [Ella & Tiffani]
(laughs) Butcher Bill.

22:16.633 --> 22:17.633
- Whooo.

22:25.833 --> 22:27.666
Oh you magician, you.

22:27.667 --> 22:29.166
Now for your next trick,

22:29.167 --> 22:31.287
you think you could find out
which door we go through?

22:32.200 --> 22:33.200
- Give me that.

22:34.067 --> 22:36.166
Only one way to find out.

22:36.167 --> 22:39.667
(slow, dark, eerie music)

22:50.567 --> 22:51.567
Voila.

22:53.933 --> 22:54.933
- Thank you.

22:56.067 --> 22:59.299
Okay, so they said the
whole upstairs is ours.

22:59.300 --> 23:03.199
As for the rest of
the house, off limits.

23:03.200 --> 23:07.266
Lemme go first.

23:07.267 --> 23:10.699
- [Ella] If must be
safe, he's going first.

23:10.700 --> 23:11.867
Giant wuss.

23:16.567 --> 23:17.567
(screams frighteningly)

23:17.568 --> 23:19.967
(girls gasp)

23:21.100 --> 23:22.100
- [Kevin] Just kidding.

23:22.101 --> 23:23.466
- You jackass.

23:23.467 --> 23:24.833
- [Tiffani] I
almost peed myself.

23:47.833 --> 23:49.367
- Not bad, not bad.

23:50.667 --> 23:52.633
I could do this for
a couple of days.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.300
Sure beats garbage
day in the city.

23:57.633 --> 24:00.300
- Okay, this is my room.

24:04.433 --> 24:05.433
- Me too.

24:07.067 --> 24:10.867
Uh-oh, it looks like the
sofa for you Mobidra.

24:12.333 --> 24:14.099
- That's fine by me.

24:14.100 --> 24:17.566
Share a bed with
perv-tastic, no thanks.

24:17.567 --> 24:19.899
And he probably snores.

24:19.900 --> 24:21.132
- No doubt.

24:21.133 --> 24:22.100
(both laugh)

24:22.101 --> 24:24.499
- Um, hello, I can hear you.

24:24.500 --> 24:26.100
I'm standing right here.

24:27.567 --> 24:28.832
- Don't even worry about it,

24:28.833 --> 24:30.233
he's not gonna get
under the covers.

24:30.257 --> 24:31.732
And if it's a problem,

24:31.733 --> 24:35.099
there's always the wooden
floor for you darling.

24:35.100 --> 24:37.066
(laughs)

24:37.067 --> 24:39.532
Come on, let's go
get our drink on.

24:39.533 --> 24:40.533
Woohoo!

24:51.267 --> 24:53.399
All right, who's in?

24:53.400 --> 24:54.233
- Me.

24:54.233 --> 24:55.167
- Me.

24:55.167 --> 24:56.167
- Nice.

24:59.700 --> 25:00.700
For you.

25:02.067 --> 25:03.067
All right.

25:05.067 --> 25:06.199
(cans pop open)

25:06.200 --> 25:07.200
- To friends.

25:09.067 --> 25:10.233
- To murderers.

25:11.500 --> 25:13.967
- To some hot country
boy up in this bitch!

25:18.100 --> 25:21.067
(strumming guitar)

25:49.800 --> 25:50.800
Whoooo!

25:52.067 --> 25:53.067
- [Tiffani] Wow.

25:53.068 --> 25:54.599
- Thank you, thank you.

25:54.600 --> 25:57.066
- I didn't know you
were a rock star.

25:57.067 --> 25:58.666
15 more of these,

25:58.667 --> 26:01.166
and I just might make
out with you tonight.

26:01.167 --> 26:03.766
- [Ella & Tiffani]
Not! (Both laugh)

26:03.767 --> 26:06.799
- Like I'd get with
either of you anyways.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.532
I do have standards you know.

26:08.533 --> 26:09.799
- Oh really?

26:09.800 --> 26:11.699
It's not what I heard.

26:11.700 --> 26:14.632
That's not what Sandy said
when she dumped your ass

26:14.633 --> 26:17.399
for filling up a
waitress in Charlie's.

26:17.400 --> 26:18.400
Beer me.

26:19.367 --> 26:21.466
- That's not what happened.

26:21.467 --> 26:22.866
That's what she told you?

26:22.867 --> 26:23.867
- What did happen?

26:25.433 --> 26:26.433
- Forget it.

26:26.434 --> 26:27.867
- We are officially out.

26:28.700 --> 26:29.899
No more beer,

26:29.900 --> 26:32.367
I guess that means it's
time to hit the hay.

26:33.533 --> 26:36.066
- Oh hell no, we
ain't doin' that.

26:36.067 --> 26:37.766
- What do you mean?

26:37.767 --> 26:39.566
We have a long day
scheduled tomorrow,

26:39.567 --> 26:41.632
we have a lot of
sight-seeing to do.

26:41.633 --> 26:43.432
We need all the rest we can get.

26:43.433 --> 26:45.533
- Yeah I'm actually a
little tired myself.

26:48.233 --> 26:49.233
- Okay.

26:50.167 --> 26:52.299
You all have voiced
your concerns,

26:52.300 --> 26:54.400
and I hear you loud and clear.

26:55.600 --> 26:57.066
But unfortunately,

26:57.067 --> 26:59.266
you're going to have to kill me

26:59.267 --> 27:02.699
if either one of you two
wanna get any sleep tonight.

27:02.700 --> 27:04.700
So, let's take a vote on it.

27:06.600 --> 27:08.833
All in favor for
going to bed tonight

27:09.800 --> 27:10.800
raise your hand.

27:16.567 --> 27:19.599
All in favor for not
going to bed tonight

27:19.600 --> 27:20.600
raise your hand.

27:24.267 --> 27:25.699
Ah, well,

27:25.700 --> 27:26.900
I guess that settles it.

27:27.900 --> 27:29.932
Get your I.D., get your wallets,

27:29.933 --> 27:34.499
we are gonna find a bar up
in this country ass town

27:34.500 --> 27:37.332
and we gonna find
some drinks and stuff.

27:37.333 --> 27:39.599
Kevin, get your phone darling.

27:39.600 --> 27:40.867
You're navigating.

27:42.700 --> 27:44.232
- Can I just say,

27:44.233 --> 27:46.466
I'm having a really great
time with you guys so far.

27:46.467 --> 27:48.533
(laughs)

27:57.333 --> 28:00.367
(deep, eerie music)

28:15.067 --> 28:18.067
(upbeat rock music)

28:19.933 --> 28:21.067
- This will have to do.

28:22.367 --> 28:23.767
- You're buying the first round.

28:25.333 --> 28:26.900
- Somebody please shoot me now.

28:28.933 --> 28:31.767
- Well hello stud,
my name is Ella.

28:32.800 --> 28:34.233
- Howdy Ella, name's Steve.

28:35.667 --> 28:39.066
Did you three stumble into
these parts accidentally or,

28:39.067 --> 28:41.966
plane crash? Land
in a corn field?

28:41.967 --> 28:46.967
- Ooh, you do have a
wild imagination Steve.

28:47.833 --> 28:50.133
I like that in a guy, it's sexy.

28:51.267 --> 28:54.132
However, we just
happen to be in town

28:54.133 --> 28:55.300
and decided to come in.

28:56.400 --> 28:59.067
Really, it's my
friend Tiffani's idea.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.067
- Tiffani, much obliged.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.432
- Fuck it was,

29:05.433 --> 29:06.533
I'd be dead right now.

29:07.967 --> 29:10.232
- I don't know if I can
mix that drink up but uh,

29:10.233 --> 29:11.832
what would y'all like?

29:11.833 --> 29:12.833
- Beer me.

29:12.834 --> 29:14.332
- Make that three,

29:14.333 --> 29:19.333
and two shots of tequila,
one for me, and one for you.

29:20.200 --> 29:23.100
- I, I like your style, I think.

29:31.333 --> 29:34.633
- Cheers guys.

29:40.167 --> 29:41.167
Cheers.

29:47.233 --> 29:49.232
You know what that was to?

29:49.233 --> 29:50.632
- What's that?

29:50.633 --> 29:52.533
- The luckiest
bartender in the world.

29:54.067 --> 29:55.599
- [Steve] Why's that?

29:55.600 --> 29:59.300
- You'll find out.

30:06.267 --> 30:07.267
- Howdy beautiful.

30:10.167 --> 30:11.500
Can I buy you some bourbon?

30:12.867 --> 30:14.167
Real smooth stuff.

30:15.800 --> 30:16.967
It'll keep you warm.

30:18.500 --> 30:20.567
From the inside, real warm.

30:22.300 --> 30:23.300
- Fuck off.

30:25.933 --> 30:26.933
- Bitch.

30:39.400 --> 30:41.866
- So hey, I just saw
your moves there,

30:41.867 --> 30:43.532
they were pretty funny there.

30:43.533 --> 30:44.999
I liked it.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.599
- Oh yeah? You like that?

30:46.600 --> 30:47.567
- Yeah I did.

30:47.567 --> 30:48.533
- You wanna see some more?

30:48.534 --> 30:51.932
I got more. (Gina chuckles)

30:51.933 --> 30:53.699
(Gina laughs)

30:53.700 --> 30:54.500
- Really?

30:54.501 --> 30:55.766
- Yeah.

30:55.767 --> 30:58.166
That's how I do it,
Kevin, by the way.

30:58.167 --> 31:00.099
- You don't look like
you're from here.

31:00.100 --> 31:01.599
- I'm from the city actually.

31:01.600 --> 31:03.099
I live in Brooklyn currently.

31:03.100 --> 31:03.933
- Oh yeah?

31:03.934 --> 31:05.132
- Yeah.

31:05.133 --> 31:07.066
- I'm from here. (Laughs)

31:07.067 --> 31:07.833
- Oh are you?

31:07.834 --> 31:09.066
- Yeah.

31:09.067 --> 31:11.232
- So you just like
to come here and

31:11.233 --> 31:16.199
scout guys with nice
dance moves like myself?

31:16.200 --> 31:18.333
Where are your moves
at, show me somethin'.

31:20.767 --> 31:22.966
- Well well well, it
looks like Kevin's

31:22.967 --> 31:24.400
nabbed himself an admirer,

31:25.633 --> 31:27.133
and she's not half bad either.

31:28.600 --> 31:30.332
- Oh that's Gina.

31:30.333 --> 31:31.533
She's a regular,

31:33.100 --> 31:34.466
and she likes to fuck.

31:34.467 --> 31:36.699
(laughing)

31:36.700 --> 31:39.067
- Well, that makes
the two of us.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.067
Way to go bro.

31:43.967 --> 31:45.566
(laughs)

31:45.567 --> 31:46.567
When do you get off?

32:06.300 --> 32:08.067
Well, that was fun.

32:09.600 --> 32:11.666
Well I guess we have to go now,

32:11.667 --> 32:14.399
we'll be taking a
long walk through

32:14.400 --> 32:16.932
a very dark woods,

32:16.933 --> 32:20.199
who knows what might be
lurking around the corners

32:20.200 --> 32:21.233
of this place

32:22.167 --> 32:23.799
in the cold,

32:23.800 --> 32:24.800
dark night.

32:26.200 --> 32:28.399
- I can get Jimmy
to, (blows smoke)

32:28.400 --> 32:31.300
wrap up and I could give you
and your friends a ride home.

32:32.233 --> 32:34.866
- Wow, I thought
you'd never ask.

32:34.867 --> 32:35.867
Shotgun!

32:37.067 --> 32:38.166
- Can I come?

32:38.167 --> 32:39.333
- Yeah, of course hun.

32:40.533 --> 32:43.232
- We do have to stop for
some smokes on the way.

32:43.233 --> 32:45.166
- Of course, let's
lock and load.

32:45.167 --> 32:48.500
- All right.

32:49.400 --> 32:52.400
(upbeat rock music)

33:30.733 --> 33:34.400
So, what does a hunk
like you do here for fun?

33:36.933 --> 33:39.899
- You know, nothing much,

33:39.900 --> 33:42.133
hiking, dirtbikin',

33:43.333 --> 33:44.566
huntin'.

33:44.567 --> 33:46.833
- (laughs) That's a lot of N's.

33:47.867 --> 33:49.499
- Wranglin', - wrangling?

33:49.500 --> 33:50.400
- Stuff like that.

33:50.400 --> 33:51.400
- I like that.

33:52.667 --> 33:54.467
- How about you?
- How's the big city?

33:56.300 --> 33:57.300
- Eh, you know.

33:58.567 --> 34:00.232
- I was thinkin' about
movin' down there,

34:00.233 --> 34:02.166
gettin' outta the
sticks, ya know but,

34:02.167 --> 34:06.566
time and, you know, it
never happens like that.

34:06.567 --> 34:08.333
- [Kevin] We're back.

34:19.067 --> 34:20.067
- Let's go.

34:25.199 --> 34:28.600
(creepy, menacing music)

34:50.667 --> 34:51.733
- Nice place.

35:03.567 --> 35:07.132
- Hey, that part of the
house is off limits.

35:07.133 --> 35:08.532
You're gonna get me in trouble,

35:08.533 --> 35:10.432
it's my name in the I-stay app,

35:10.433 --> 35:12.367
they will charge
me a penalty fee.

35:13.667 --> 35:16.167
- Too bad fuckboy,
we're going exploring.

35:17.900 --> 35:19.867
- Mm, fuckboy, I like that.

35:20.867 --> 35:22.967
(laughs)

35:24.600 --> 35:27.700
(deep, creepy music)

35:37.333 --> 35:39.067
- Now that's what
I call a bedroom.

35:40.200 --> 35:42.066
- You sure it's
cool to be in here?

35:42.067 --> 35:43.433
Your friend seemed concerned.

35:44.600 --> 35:47.567
- It's fine, should
be fine, come on.

35:49.467 --> 35:52.067
(erotic music)

35:54.433 --> 35:55.700
I'll take that.

36:11.500 --> 36:14.599
I got something for you.

36:14.600 --> 36:16.767
(giggles)

36:22.767 --> 36:23.767
Surprise.

36:40.567 --> 36:43.566
(Ella moaning)

36:43.567 --> 36:46.133
(erotic music)

37:10.600 --> 37:11.600
- Oh, shit.

37:14.467 --> 37:15.932
Oh, damn.

37:15.933 --> 37:16.933
Take that shirt off.

37:20.433 --> 37:22.667
(grunting)

37:36.433 --> 37:39.299
Your ass.

37:39.300 --> 37:41.467
(moaning)

37:44.467 --> 37:45.467
- Wait.

37:45.468 --> 37:48.066
(moaning)

37:48.067 --> 37:49.632
- Gross.

37:49.633 --> 37:53.300
(Ella moaning and grunting)

38:17.267 --> 38:18.267
- Mmm.

38:21.067 --> 38:26.067
That was great. (Giggles)

38:29.667 --> 38:30.767
- I gotta go,

38:33.567 --> 38:36.366
they'll be wondering where I am.

38:36.367 --> 38:37.367
- They?

38:38.467 --> 38:40.767
Girlfriend? Wife perhaps?

38:42.833 --> 38:46.066
Aww, don't worry farm boy,

38:46.067 --> 38:48.067
your secret's safe with me.

38:49.067 --> 38:51.132
I won't tell anybody.

38:51.133 --> 38:53.066
(giggles)

38:53.067 --> 38:55.899
Y'all come back now, ya hear?

38:55.900 --> 38:56.900
Toodles.

38:58.700 --> 38:59.700
Man.

39:05.967 --> 39:09.800
(deep, sharp, menacing music)

39:26.633 --> 39:27.633
- Whoo!

39:42.933 --> 39:46.167
(choking and gurgling)

39:58.533 --> 40:01.700
(deep menacing music)

40:40.900 --> 40:43.967
(creepy opera music)

41:01.067 --> 41:04.333
(Steve gasping for air)

41:29.267 --> 41:31.533
(gurgling)

41:55.133 --> 41:58.266
(heavy blood splatter)

41:58.267 --> 42:01.333
(creepy opera music)

42:22.400 --> 42:25.633
(gurgling and gagging)

42:39.500 --> 42:40.500
- I'm tired.

42:42.467 --> 42:46.432
- Yeah, I think me and you
should just go to sleep.

42:46.433 --> 42:47.600
- Let's do it.

42:48.767 --> 42:51.267
- Yeah, that was a long night.

42:58.633 --> 43:00.099
- Pinch my nipples.

43:00.100 --> 43:02.633
(Gina giggles)

43:04.567 --> 43:06.800
(chopping)

43:28.933 --> 43:32.200
(loud, menacing tunes)

43:42.933 --> 43:44.466
- Okay.

43:44.467 --> 43:47.200
(breathing hard)

44:04.767 --> 44:07.500
(fire crackling)

44:48.533 --> 44:52.367
(slightly creepy piano music)

45:11.833 --> 45:15.433
(bones clanking in bucket)

45:37.367 --> 45:39.467
- My God, it's the worst.

45:41.767 --> 45:44.632
I'm not drinking
tequila shots again.

45:44.633 --> 45:45.700
Make it stop.

45:51.200 --> 45:52.866
Okay.

45:52.867 --> 45:56.700
(slightly creepy piano music)

47:41.767 --> 47:42.767
Oh God.

47:50.100 --> 47:52.066
- [Kevin] Fuck.

47:52.067 --> 47:53.400
- So, lovebirds,

47:55.067 --> 47:56.300
breakfast is served.

47:58.533 --> 48:01.066
- How can you be so
chipper man this morning,

48:01.067 --> 48:03.599
my head is on fucking fire.

48:03.600 --> 48:05.367
- Yeah, I think I'm gonna puke.

48:06.367 --> 48:08.132
- Well first of all,

48:08.133 --> 48:11.466
I wasn't hitting the
tequila shots like you,

48:11.467 --> 48:15.232
secondly, I wasn't
up fucking all night

48:15.233 --> 48:16.300
like the both of you,

48:17.433 --> 48:18.533
and thirdly...

48:19.800 --> 48:20.800
- Thirdly what?

48:22.067 --> 48:25.432
- Thirdly, eat your breakfast
and get your shit together.

48:25.433 --> 48:27.067
We have a long day today,

48:28.200 --> 48:30.966
and the first stop of
the Tiffani murder tours

48:30.967 --> 48:34.599
is the Codebrook
Motel triple homicide.

48:34.600 --> 48:35.667
- Oh God.

48:36.800 --> 48:39.367
(creepy music)

48:59.700 --> 49:02.467
(faucet running)

49:44.300 --> 49:45.766
- [Tiffani] Kevin,

49:45.767 --> 49:47.966
can you help me with the dishes?

49:47.967 --> 49:48.967
- Coming.

49:53.400 --> 49:54.599
- [Tiffani] Nathan Jackson

49:54.600 --> 49:56.600
was the owner of
the Flashback Motel,

49:57.767 --> 49:59.667
since renamed the
Codebrook Motel.

50:01.700 --> 50:04.099
Nathan was good
with electronics.

50:04.100 --> 50:07.332
He had each room bugged
with pinhole cameras

50:07.333 --> 50:10.666
overlooking the
bed and a bathroom.

50:10.667 --> 50:14.599
In fact, each room had
approximately 10 hidden cameras

50:14.600 --> 50:16.899
hooked up to the master console.

50:16.900 --> 50:19.632
Every night, Nathan
would sit at the console

50:19.633 --> 50:21.367
in his back office watching.

50:22.900 --> 50:25.966
To say that he was
aroused by this footage

50:25.967 --> 50:27.333
would be an understatement.

50:28.533 --> 50:31.899
Over a seven year
span back in the '90s,

50:31.900 --> 50:33.799
Nathan began
sneaking in the rooms

50:33.800 --> 50:36.799
of the guest that gave
him a real good cam show

50:36.800 --> 50:40.132
and would torture and kill
them right where they lay,

50:40.133 --> 50:42.800
and of course, it was
all on camera still.

50:43.900 --> 50:47.167
(deep, haunting music)

50:49.133 --> 50:52.466
Candace was Butcher
Bills seventh victim.

50:52.467 --> 50:54.133
Her friends called
her Bubblegum.

50:55.100 --> 50:56.966
She was a working girl.

50:56.967 --> 50:59.566
She was working all the
way up until the one night

50:59.567 --> 51:01.267
she ended up in
the wrong vehicle.

51:02.500 --> 51:04.433
Butcher Bills
beige pickup truck.

51:05.567 --> 51:08.467
Knocked unconscious,
she didn't feel anything

51:09.800 --> 51:12.832
until she woke up
dangling from a meat hook

51:12.833 --> 51:14.067
inside of Bill's barn.

51:15.533 --> 51:16.533
And here it is.

51:17.600 --> 51:18.732
- Terrific.

51:18.733 --> 51:20.499
- Candace was drugged
up just enough

51:20.500 --> 51:22.260
that when the butcher
had peeled all the skin

51:22.284 --> 51:25.399
off her right arm, she
screamed bloody murder,

51:25.400 --> 51:27.399
but did not lose consciousness.

51:27.400 --> 51:29.067
Same with the left arm.

51:30.200 --> 51:32.099
In fact, it wasn't
until the butcher...

51:32.100 --> 51:32.933
- Aargh.

51:32.934 --> 51:34.199
(Ella gasps in shock)

51:34.200 --> 51:35.766
- You fuckin' jerk.

51:35.767 --> 51:37.833
(laughs)

51:38.700 --> 51:39.899
- Where did you get that?

51:39.900 --> 51:41.799
- From behind the barn there.

51:41.800 --> 51:43.932
There's all sorts of
rusty things over there.

51:43.933 --> 51:46.933
- Put that thing back, you're
disturbing a piece of history.

51:48.067 --> 51:49.799
- You are loopy.

51:49.800 --> 51:52.432
Does your mother know
how screwed up you are?

51:52.433 --> 51:53.433
- My mother's dead.

51:54.533 --> 51:56.132
- Sorry about that.

51:56.133 --> 51:57.866
- I killed her.

51:57.867 --> 52:00.267
(all laugh)

52:02.467 --> 52:03.666
- Okay, okay.

52:03.667 --> 52:05.499
Look, this is a
lovely story and all,

52:05.500 --> 52:07.499
and I can't wait to
hear the rest of Candace

52:07.500 --> 52:08.866
the dead hooker,

52:08.867 --> 52:10.566
but, you know,

52:10.567 --> 52:12.699
all the body arts
and stuff and yeah,

52:12.700 --> 52:15.566
serial killers and shit
hangin' in barns and

52:15.567 --> 52:18.866
fuckin' tools that you're rip
people apart with but really,

52:18.867 --> 52:20.787
I really wanna get outta
here 'cause I'm startin'

52:20.811 --> 52:21.911
to feel a little sick.

52:22.800 --> 52:24.400
- Okay, fine,

52:25.533 --> 52:28.199
just one more quick stop
before we head home.

52:28.200 --> 52:29.200
- What?

52:31.233 --> 52:32.967
Why, why?

52:37.400 --> 52:40.500
(gentle piano music)

52:44.667 --> 52:46.899
Oh, how fitting,
a graveyard, gee.

52:46.900 --> 52:49.799
I wonder who and how
many people died here,

52:49.800 --> 52:52.299
and what was the tools that
they used to kill them with?

52:52.300 --> 52:54.799
Oh, and how bad did they suffer?

52:54.800 --> 52:57.199
Gee, give me all
the gory details.

52:57.200 --> 53:01.767
- Actually, this story involves
a young girl named Nora.

53:03.600 --> 53:05.832
There are different accounts
of the Nora murders.

53:05.833 --> 53:08.767
So, it's almost like local
folklore at this point.

53:10.667 --> 53:13.266
But most can agree
on some of the facts.

53:13.267 --> 53:15.400
It was Halloween night
almost 20 years ago.

53:16.733 --> 53:19.232
She went trick or treating
with her brothers.

53:19.233 --> 53:21.332
She ran off without
them seeing her

53:21.333 --> 53:24.066
to the house at a
corner of the street.

53:24.067 --> 53:27.066
Again, details are
sketchy as to which house,

53:27.067 --> 53:29.333
what street, even her last name.

53:30.767 --> 53:31.767
What they do know

53:32.800 --> 53:35.399
is that the next time
that Nora was found,

53:35.400 --> 53:38.066
she was nailed to the
inside of the front door

53:38.067 --> 53:39.067
of that house,

53:39.900 --> 53:40.900
just hanging there

53:41.800 --> 53:43.099
like a big X.

53:43.100 --> 53:44.332
- Oh that's it,

53:44.333 --> 53:46.732
we are getting the fuck
outta here right now.

53:46.733 --> 53:49.099
- I didn't even get
to Nora murders parts.

53:49.100 --> 53:50.666
- I don't give a shit.

53:50.667 --> 53:53.699
- Okay, fine, but tonight,

53:53.700 --> 53:55.866
we are having a seance

53:55.867 --> 53:58.832
to try and wake the
spirits of Swamp Hollow.

53:58.833 --> 54:01.766
- Oh the fuck no we're not.

54:01.767 --> 54:03.366
Oh come on, man,

54:03.367 --> 54:05.299
I had enough of this spook shit.

54:05.300 --> 54:08.799
I just wanna see my stud
bar boy tonight please.

54:08.800 --> 54:09.867
- Yeah, me too,

54:11.067 --> 54:13.233
but not stud boy,
more like stud girl.

54:14.633 --> 54:17.699
She kinda snuck out last
night while I was sleeping.

54:17.700 --> 54:20.132
I didn't even get the
chance to say goodbye.

54:20.133 --> 54:21.900
- I would take that
as a hint dude.

54:23.333 --> 54:26.666
Anyways, you all got to do
what you wanted last night,

54:26.667 --> 54:28.399
now it's my turn to choose.

54:28.400 --> 54:29.400
It's my day.

54:30.367 --> 54:31.632
- Your turn?

54:31.633 --> 54:35.132
We have been doing this
spook shit all day long!

54:35.133 --> 54:37.166
All I wanna do is spend
a nice day in the country

54:37.167 --> 54:39.066
and this is not my
idea of doing it.

54:39.067 --> 54:40.599
Kevin.

54:40.600 --> 54:41.667
- Well actually,

54:42.667 --> 54:43.667
it was kinda cool.

54:45.400 --> 54:47.467
- Okay, let's vote on it.

54:48.900 --> 54:51.332
All in favor of a seance tonight

54:51.333 --> 54:52.333
raise your hand.

54:54.700 --> 54:58.366
Great that's two against one.

54:58.367 --> 54:59.532
Let's go.

54:59.533 --> 55:00.533
- Shit.

55:04.700 --> 55:07.267
(creepy music)

55:29.367 --> 55:30.899
- Hey guys,

55:30.900 --> 55:32.900
I told you that we're not
allowed to use any of the

55:32.901 --> 55:34.141
rooms downstairs in this house,

55:34.165 --> 55:35.599
they're off limits.

55:35.600 --> 55:36.840
You're gonna get me in trouble,

55:36.864 --> 55:39.099
they have my credit
card information.

55:39.100 --> 55:41.332
- Oh will you relax?

55:41.333 --> 55:43.932
It's not like the rental
office is next door.

55:43.933 --> 55:45.599
I mean, don't you
know where we are

55:45.600 --> 55:47.532
in the middle of nowhere?

55:47.533 --> 55:50.499
Did you not hear what the
rapist cab driver said?

55:50.500 --> 55:54.299
Middle of nowhere, okay?

55:54.300 --> 55:56.899
And besides, they left
a key right out in front

55:56.900 --> 56:00.599
so we got full reign, and
I don't care what you say,

56:00.600 --> 56:04.200
but I am loving
my king size bed.

56:05.800 --> 56:07.533
- What in the hell
are you wearing?

56:08.733 --> 56:11.066
- This outfit will help
me to better communicate

56:11.067 --> 56:12.067
with the dead.

56:12.800 --> 56:15.199
(laughing)

56:15.200 --> 56:16.600
- You're hilarious, classic.

56:18.067 --> 56:21.466
What do you do, carry that thing
with you everywhere you go?

56:21.467 --> 56:23.199
- You know how we roll,

56:23.200 --> 56:25.732
always carry at least
two changes of clothing

56:25.733 --> 56:27.267
in our bags at all times,

56:28.700 --> 56:31.466
just in case the day takes
us somewhere unplanned.

56:31.467 --> 56:34.166
Raver rule number 47,

56:34.167 --> 56:37.232
I happen to carry three
changes of clothes with me

56:37.233 --> 56:40.166
just in case we
were to encounter

56:40.167 --> 56:41.567
this very situation.

56:43.233 --> 56:46.132
- That's cool,
always be prepared.

56:46.133 --> 56:49.399
- Yeah well, you know
how I get prepared?

56:49.400 --> 56:51.066
Always carry lingerie.

56:51.067 --> 56:52.366
Prepared!

56:52.367 --> 56:54.666
(giggles)

56:54.667 --> 56:55.967
- This isn't a card table.

57:01.600 --> 57:03.666
- Is it not a bar either?

57:03.667 --> 57:05.067
- No, it isn't.

57:06.067 --> 57:07.966
- All right. (Laughs)

57:07.967 --> 57:10.532
Let's get on with
this, call up the dead.

57:10.533 --> 57:12.100
I wanna see this shit for real.

57:13.933 --> 57:16.099
- This is not how it works.

57:16.100 --> 57:19.067
We need to focus and unite
our connective energies.

57:21.900 --> 57:23.432
Focus!

57:23.433 --> 57:24.433
- [Kevin] Fine.

57:27.400 --> 57:29.266
- Come on guys, please.

57:29.267 --> 57:30.767
Let's take each others hands,

57:31.867 --> 57:32.867
close our eyes.

57:36.333 --> 57:37.867
Oh spirits of Swamp Hollow,

57:39.167 --> 57:42.332
we thank you as
visitors of your realm

57:42.333 --> 57:43.733
for your hospitality.

57:46.200 --> 57:47.767
Ooohm.

57:51.100 --> 57:53.699
We are not here to disturb you,

57:53.700 --> 57:57.600
but to ask you to enlighten
us with your knowledge.

57:59.067 --> 58:02.133
Knowledge that you're
willing to impart upon us.

58:04.733 --> 58:05.733
Nora,

58:07.533 --> 58:08.533
Nora,

58:09.833 --> 58:13.066
the secular world longs to know

58:13.067 --> 58:15.133
what happened to you
that horrible night.

58:16.833 --> 58:17.833
Where were you?

58:19.167 --> 58:20.167
Who were you with?

58:21.300 --> 58:22.333
What happened to you?

58:24.633 --> 58:25.633
Where were you?

58:26.467 --> 58:27.600
Who were you with?

58:28.867 --> 58:29.900
What happened to you?

58:34.433 --> 58:39.432
- At the corner of
a yellow maple road.

58:39.433 --> 58:40.667
- [Kevin] Old man Detmar,

58:41.800 --> 58:43.767
the owner of the
corner store in town.

58:47.767 --> 58:51.099
- I choked on his lollipop.

58:51.100 --> 58:53.500
(both laugh)

58:59.733 --> 59:01.699
- That's just great you guys.

59:01.700 --> 59:03.967
You just ruined any
chance of any connection.

59:05.300 --> 59:08.799
- Oh, so fucking sue me
man, I'm going to bed.

59:08.800 --> 59:10.699
- [Kevin] Sue me too I guess.

59:10.700 --> 59:12.933
(laughing)

59:15.167 --> 59:17.766
(cards clapping against wall)

59:17.767 --> 59:18.767
- I'm sorry Nora.

59:19.867 --> 59:21.567
My friends are assholes.

59:22.967 --> 59:26.200
(deep spiritual music)

01:00:13.433 --> 01:00:16.433
(slightly grunting)

01:00:48.433 --> 01:00:51.333
(angrily grunting)

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.532
(gasps in shock)

01:00:58.533 --> 01:01:00.867
(blunt hit)

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:07.700
(creepy opera music)

01:01:20.767 --> 01:01:22.067
- What the f...

01:01:25.133 --> 01:01:27.067
What the fuck happened?

01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:29.300
Oh my God!

01:01:30.067 --> 01:01:33.100
(creepy opera music)

01:01:52.933 --> 01:01:55.867
(deep eerie music)

01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:05.540
- Don't worry I'm
not mad at you guys

01:02:05.564 --> 01:02:07.099
anymore for last night.

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:09.867
I realized you must have
had gore overload, my bad.

01:02:11.833 --> 01:02:12.833
- I'm not worried,

01:02:13.767 --> 01:02:15.899
and did you just
apologize to me?

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:17.466
- Barely.

01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:19.466
Hey has Ella been
in touch with you?

01:02:19.467 --> 01:02:21.132
I haven't seen her this morning,

01:02:21.133 --> 01:02:23.532
and I went to try and
find her downstairs,

01:02:23.533 --> 01:02:25.133
that place is creepy down there.

01:02:26.533 --> 01:02:28.732
- How many times do I
have to tell you guys

01:02:28.733 --> 01:02:30.666
not to go down there?

01:02:30.667 --> 01:02:33.399
Okay, you're going
to get me in trouble.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.567
Seriously, how come
nobody listens to me?

01:02:37.367 --> 01:02:39.199
- Anyway, she wasn't down there.

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:41.900
The bed isn't made and she
isn't anywhere to be found.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:46.300
(knocking on door)

01:02:47.467 --> 01:02:48.467
- Oh shit.

01:02:56.733 --> 01:02:59.900
(raindrops splashing)

01:03:06.067 --> 01:03:07.067
- Ella?

01:03:08.367 --> 01:03:09.367
- Hello?

01:03:10.367 --> 01:03:12.066
Ella?

01:03:12.067 --> 01:03:13.067
- Ella, you here?

01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:27.100
- Strange.

01:03:27.101 --> 01:03:28.699
- Is Ella fucking with us?

01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:29.533
(sudden deep menacing tune)

01:03:29.533 --> 01:03:30.533
Jesus!

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:41.599
- Um, can we help you?

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.900
- I've seen the vision
since the dawn of time.

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:47.066
The curses are upon us.

01:03:47.067 --> 01:03:48.499
There's nowhere to run

01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.100
and nowhere to hide.

01:03:51.333 --> 01:03:53.399
- Lady, what're
you talking about?

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.299
Who are you? Why are you here?

01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:56.799
- Why am I here?

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:59.066
That's a good question.

01:03:59.067 --> 01:04:01.400
I haven't been in these
parts and 40 years.

01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:04.400
- Hold on a second.

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:09.899
Yo, this chick is crazy.

01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:11.066
40 years ago?

01:04:11.067 --> 01:04:12.147
This chick would've been...

01:04:12.171 --> 01:04:13.766
- Negative 16 years old.

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:14.767
- Exactly.

01:04:16.367 --> 01:04:17.599
She's hot though.

01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:18.600
Ow!

01:04:20.267 --> 01:04:21.933
Let's just find
out what she wants.

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:32.767
- Beware of the danger
that lurks in this world.

01:04:34.133 --> 01:04:38.600
The spiritual presence is
strong and deep in these parts.

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:42.466
The energy here does
more harm than good.

01:04:42.467 --> 01:04:44.666
- What about the energy on me?

01:04:44.667 --> 01:04:46.067
Don't I get a face rub too?

01:04:47.467 --> 01:04:49.200
- Why do you feel
like old souls?

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:52.699
What purpose do you have here?

01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:54.367
Are you here to
disturb the dead?

01:04:56.100 --> 01:04:58.066
- No we're not here
to disturb anybody,

01:04:58.067 --> 01:05:01.100
we're just taking some time off
from the bustle of the city.

01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:04.233
- Your lies do not become you.

01:05:07.233 --> 01:05:08.467
Leave this place,

01:05:10.067 --> 01:05:11.832
leave this place.

01:05:11.833 --> 01:05:14.666
Why must you test the spirits?

01:05:14.667 --> 01:05:17.467
Leave, leave, and leave now.

01:05:23.533 --> 01:05:26.267
(rain splashing)

01:05:31.967 --> 01:05:34.199
- C'mon, finish your breakfast.

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:36.367
Don't let broom Hilda
ruin our last day.

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:39.267
- She just creeps me out.

01:05:43.467 --> 01:05:44.467
(glass spills)

01:05:44.467 --> 01:05:45.467
- [Kevin] Shit.

01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:49.067
I think I saw some towels
in the hallway closet.

01:06:01.133 --> 01:06:03.700
(message tone)

01:06:05.433 --> 01:06:09.467
- Sorry, ran off to hang
with my sexy bartender today.

01:06:10.667 --> 01:06:12.466
All your death talk
yesterday got me all

01:06:12.467 --> 01:06:14.532
hot and bothered I guess.

01:06:14.533 --> 01:06:16.732
- [Both] Don't do
anything I wouldn't do,

01:06:16.733 --> 01:06:19.566
winky face, winky
face, smiley face.

01:06:19.567 --> 01:06:20.733
X-O-X-O.

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:23.767
- Well, there you have it.

01:06:24.767 --> 01:06:26.232
I guess just you and me today.

01:06:26.233 --> 01:06:31.199
- Yes, and today is my day,
so no voting necessary.

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.699
We do as I say.

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:33.800
- And what do you say?

01:06:34.967 --> 01:06:38.067
Well I guess the bedroom
is outta the question?

01:06:39.567 --> 01:06:41.767
- I will cut you
fucker, don't go there.

01:06:42.767 --> 01:06:44.432
- I was just joking,

01:06:44.433 --> 01:06:46.966
you don't have to
be a bitch about it.

01:06:46.967 --> 01:06:48.233
- Okay, fine.

01:06:49.667 --> 01:06:52.067
I'm sorry. Let's go fuck.

01:06:53.733 --> 01:06:55.799
I'm kidding, geez.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:56.800
So gullible.

01:06:58.533 --> 01:07:01.299
- Anyway, let's
just get outta here.

01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:02.832
Figure it out on the road.

01:07:02.833 --> 01:07:05.199
We can just walk
into town I guess.

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.132
- [Tiffani] At least
you have a plan.

01:07:07.133 --> 01:07:08.133
- Let's go.

01:07:28.967 --> 01:07:32.067
(creepy opera music)

01:08:14.867 --> 01:08:16.800
(thud)

01:08:18.233 --> 01:08:20.466
(grunting)

01:08:25.233 --> 01:08:27.966
- So Kev, how do you like
the country life up here?

01:08:29.067 --> 01:08:30.765
I think it's kinda cool.

01:08:30.767 --> 01:08:31.899
Laid back, but cool.

01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:36.732
- Yep. I remember it
like it was yesterday.

01:08:36.733 --> 01:08:37.733
- Remember what?

01:08:39.067 --> 01:08:42.067
- I mean, I remember country
living like it was yesterday.

01:08:43.067 --> 01:08:44.367
This is what I used to do.

01:08:45.733 --> 01:08:49.099
I mean, not here but, you know.

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:50.332
It's all the same shit.

01:08:50.332 --> 01:08:52.233
Whichever bum-fuck
town you grow up in.

01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:54.500
So I remember

01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.733
all this like it was yesterday.

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.733
- And? Bueno?

01:09:01.567 --> 01:09:02.932
No bueno?

01:09:02.933 --> 01:09:06.432
- Well, aside form waste
products for parents,

01:09:06.433 --> 01:09:07.899
it wasn't all that bad.

01:09:09.167 --> 01:09:10.966
I woulda punch my father
back if knew he would

01:09:10.991 --> 01:09:12.224
remember it the next day.

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:15.233
You know, that kinda shit.

01:09:16.133 --> 01:09:17.500
- Wow, sorry.

01:09:18.466 --> 01:09:19.767
- Same goes for my mother.

01:09:21.067 --> 01:09:22.067
Bitch.

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:27.066
- Well, my perfect upbringing
wasn't that much more fun

01:09:27.067 --> 01:09:28.866
from what I remember.

01:09:28.867 --> 01:09:30.799
At least yours was interesting

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.600
in a fucked up freak
show kinda way.

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:35.099
- Thank you?

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:37.399
- Where the fuck are we anyway?

01:09:37.399 --> 01:09:38.767
- It's just a little further.

01:09:41.767 --> 01:09:46.767
(Ella crying) (menacing music)

01:09:57.533 --> 01:09:58.533
- Oh my God.

01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:04.732
- So, why did you
and Sandy break up?

01:10:04.733 --> 01:10:06.700
If it wasn't action
with that waitress.

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:09.433
- It's a log story.

01:10:13.533 --> 01:10:15.067
Action with a big black guy.

01:10:16.667 --> 01:10:17.667
Story over.

01:10:18.467 --> 01:10:20.599
- That's a joke right?

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:21.600
You and a big dude?

01:10:22.467 --> 01:10:23.467
- No.

01:10:24.433 --> 01:10:26.433
I walked in on her
fucking her neighbor.

01:10:27.633 --> 01:10:30.299
She didn't know I had
the key to her place,

01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:32.933
she was all mad at me for
coming in without knocking.

01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:38.567
- You are such a buzzkill.

01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:40.800
- Apparently.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.066
But I don't blame him though,

01:10:44.067 --> 01:10:46.833
he was just another guy
screwing some random chick.

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.100
She was the one that
was unforgivable.

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:52.200
Whore bitch.

01:10:53.667 --> 01:10:55.232
- Hey,

01:10:55.233 --> 01:10:56.600
I'm sorry I brought it up.

01:10:57.433 --> 01:10:58.433
I didn't know.

01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:01.100
- That's okay.

01:11:02.067 --> 01:11:03.067
It's all good now.

01:11:07.567 --> 01:11:09.266
(menacing music)

01:11:09.267 --> 01:11:10.400
- Oh God.

01:11:22.167 --> 01:11:24.267
(crying)

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:51.533
(horrified gasp)

01:11:57.367 --> 01:12:00.867
(menacing suspense music)

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:47.367
(creepy opera music)

01:13:00.933 --> 01:13:02.399
- I'm gonna go
have a smoke quick.

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:03.880
- I reckon you'll
have a knee slapping

01:13:03.904 --> 01:13:05.299
good 'ole time with that.

01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:07.300
See, I'm kinda liking
this country vibe.

01:13:08.933 --> 01:13:09.933
- You are weird.

01:13:15.067 --> 01:13:18.133
(creepy opera music)

01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:50.300
- Boo!

01:13:50.301 --> 01:13:52.399
- Oh shit. (Laughing)

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:53.599
- I got you.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:54.966
- You bitch.

01:13:54.967 --> 01:13:55.967
Scared the shit outta me.

01:13:55.968 --> 01:13:58.099
Made me drop my smoke.

01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:59.100
- I got you though.

01:14:00.567 --> 01:14:02.532
This mask looks real, right?

01:14:02.533 --> 01:14:04.567
I found it in one of
the bedroom drawers.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.266
C'mon, it's our last night.

01:14:08.267 --> 01:14:10.233
Ella's not allowed
to have all the fun.

01:14:13.433 --> 01:14:17.533
(opera music fades, chair rocks)

01:14:18.533 --> 01:14:21.600
(creepy piano music)

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:34.500
♪ Up here in the woods

01:14:35.667 --> 01:14:39.900
♪ I'm getting drunk
with all my friends ♪

01:14:41.867 --> 01:14:45.933
♪ I'm up here in
the woooooooods ♪

01:14:54.967 --> 01:15:00.067
♪ Up here in the woods

01:15:01.433 --> 01:15:06.433
♪ I'm getting drunk
with all my friends ♪

01:15:08.167 --> 01:15:12.333
♪ I'm up here in
the wooooooooods ♪

01:15:18.633 --> 01:15:20.967
- I like the direction
your music was taking.

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:25.600
Much better than that uppity
pop crap you usually play.

01:15:26.467 --> 01:15:27.867
- Thank you I guess?

01:15:34.133 --> 01:15:37.800
So, what's your story for real?

01:15:38.967 --> 01:15:40.666
We've been friends
for a while now but,

01:15:40.667 --> 01:15:43.433
I hardly know
anything about you.

01:15:45.067 --> 01:15:48.732
Why are you so
withdrawn all the time?

01:15:48.733 --> 01:15:50.867
- And what do you wanna know?

01:15:52.367 --> 01:15:53.932
- I don't know,

01:15:53.933 --> 01:15:57.233
like who's the last
guy you slept with?

01:15:58.567 --> 01:16:01.067
- (laughs) Just like a man,

01:16:02.067 --> 01:16:03.200
one track mind.

01:16:06.067 --> 01:16:07.933
Last guy I slept with,

01:16:09.367 --> 01:16:10.866
Lisa

01:16:10.867 --> 01:16:12.067
the barista

01:16:13.067 --> 01:16:15.766
at East Village Cafe.

01:16:15.767 --> 01:16:17.100
- Get out of here.

01:16:19.067 --> 01:16:20.067
- You're welcome.

01:16:20.767 --> 01:16:22.100
For your wet dream tonight.

01:16:24.067 --> 01:16:25.866
I like guys by the way,

01:16:25.867 --> 01:16:27.666
just not boys like you.

01:16:27.667 --> 01:16:29.267
- Like I'd want you anyways.

01:16:30.467 --> 01:16:31.900
I mean what is there to want?

01:16:34.667 --> 01:16:36.067
- Wouldn't you like to know.

01:16:39.167 --> 01:16:40.467
You would wouldn't you?

01:16:42.300 --> 01:16:43.767
Ella's more my type anyway.

01:16:45.667 --> 01:16:48.900
Strong, sexy, funny,

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:51.300
you should take notes.

01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:55.667
- Now it all makes sense.

01:16:58.467 --> 01:17:01.132
- Keep telling yourself that.

01:17:01.133 --> 01:17:03.300
If I were straight,
I'd be all over you.

01:17:09.433 --> 01:17:12.966
- Anyways, how
about another song?

01:17:12.967 --> 01:17:15.867
(strumming guitar)

01:17:29.667 --> 01:17:33.067
(ice clacking in glass)

01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:42.867
- We haven't even
finished a bottle yet.

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:46.500
- [Kevin] Bourbon.

01:17:48.367 --> 01:17:49.600
- [Tiffani] You lightweight.

01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:07.067
Hey, so you know,

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:10.333
that Lisa thing
was two years ago.

01:18:13.867 --> 01:18:15.599
- Better was.

01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:16.799
- Yeah.

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:18.733
Long fucking time without sex.

01:18:20.333 --> 01:18:22.867
- Sex, I like sex.

01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:28.599
- Maybe I should've
done like you guys.

01:18:28.600 --> 01:18:31.600
Get me a nice
country boy, or girl.

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:37.466
I just kinda hopes that
Ella would slip up and

01:18:37.467 --> 01:18:38.833
play my team for the night.

01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:40.700
That didn't happen.

01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:45.800
- Play on your team, huh. Okay.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.833
- By the way, you are cool.

01:18:52.200 --> 01:18:53.600
I like hanging out with you.

01:18:55.900 --> 01:18:57.467
- [Kevin] Gee, thanks.

01:18:59.667 --> 01:19:00.867
- You are very talented.

01:19:02.333 --> 01:19:05.299
I wish I could play the
guitar like you can.

01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:06.300
- Bet you do.

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:10.400
- You are even cute sometimes.

01:19:12.167 --> 01:19:14.599
I'm sorry I give
you so much shit.

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:16.467
I'm just fucked up.

01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:19.300
- Very fucked up.

01:19:21.467 --> 01:19:22.733
- I guess I deserve that.

01:19:29.633 --> 01:19:30.667
I like you, you know.

01:19:32.333 --> 01:19:33.333
You're very sweet.

01:19:35.433 --> 01:19:37.433
A lot sweeter than
the other friends.

01:19:39.567 --> 01:19:40.567
- [Kevin] Thanks.

01:19:45.067 --> 01:19:47.233
- You're not gonna rememeber
any of this are you?

01:19:48.467 --> 01:19:49.467
- Nope.

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:53.600
- Hey,

01:19:55.133 --> 01:19:56.367
I'm gonna go take a bath.

01:19:59.067 --> 01:20:00.067
Come and say hi.

01:20:05.333 --> 01:20:06.333
- Hello.

01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:13.900
Oh shit.

01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:20.399
(slow, mysterious music)

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:23.067
(water running)

01:21:27.933 --> 01:21:30.600
(door creaking)

01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:55.233
(footsteps)

01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:03.200
- Kevin, is that you?

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:16.267
I thought you
weren't gonna come.

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:19.100
I've been waiting for you.

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:29.933
Well, aren't you gonna join me?

01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:36.067
(loud thud, blood squishing)

01:22:38.567 --> 01:22:40.733
(gagging)

01:22:44.833 --> 01:22:47.400
(creepy music)

01:23:41.067 --> 01:23:45.066
- You know, you really
think I wanna hear this shit

01:23:45.067 --> 01:23:47.233
from you all day long?

01:23:48.267 --> 01:23:50.067
Ella, Ella, Ella,

01:23:50.933 --> 01:23:52.266
I know,

01:23:52.267 --> 01:23:53.899
you don't wanna fuck me.

01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:57.067
Okay, so, I got
it loud and clear.

01:23:59.700 --> 01:24:03.066
You're not that hot
anyways stripper.

01:24:03.067 --> 01:24:06.333
Always yapping your mouth,
you're just too cool for school.

01:24:07.933 --> 01:24:09.599
Why do I even hang out with you?

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:12.132
Just say it, say it to my face.

01:24:12.133 --> 01:24:14.466
Call me a loser
okay, I can take it.

01:24:14.467 --> 01:24:16.533
I take it from
everyone all day long.

01:24:18.267 --> 01:24:19.267
Even Tiffani.

01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:22.232
Tiffani,

01:24:22.233 --> 01:24:24.199
I thought you'd be cool to me.

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:25.866
Pretending like you're
into me sometimes

01:24:25.867 --> 01:24:27.699
and then you just go off on me,

01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:29.699
it's verbal assault.

01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:34.066
Where do you even get
off up in black dahlia?

01:24:34.067 --> 01:24:38.499
Oh, you're so obsessed
with murders, whoopty shit.

01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:39.733
Like anyone gives a shit.

01:24:41.133 --> 01:24:43.599
Why the fuck do I even hang
out with the two of you?

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:45.480
I mean isn't there anyone
out there in the world

01:24:45.481 --> 01:24:46.713
that is not a total dick,

01:24:46.714 --> 01:24:49.867
I mean a real fucking
veiny certifiable cock?

01:25:31.133 --> 01:25:33.932
I mean what the fuck am
I gonna do with myself?

01:25:33.933 --> 01:25:36.066
Am I just gonna keep
takin' this shit?

01:25:36.067 --> 01:25:38.566
I am not going to let
these toxic relationships

01:25:38.567 --> 01:25:40.367
get to the point they
get to next time around,

01:25:40.391 --> 01:25:43.066
I mean you say a couple
bad things to me, about me,

01:25:43.067 --> 01:25:44.067
and that is it.

01:25:45.767 --> 01:25:48.232
I can make new
friends easy enough.

01:25:48.233 --> 01:25:50.633
I don't have to continually
take shit from nobody.

01:26:00.067 --> 01:26:02.799
Like you for example.

01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:04.520
Are you really just
gonna treat me like that

01:26:04.544 --> 01:26:05.944
and expect me to do nothing?

01:26:07.267 --> 01:26:09.700
How do you expect someone to
just sit there and take it?

01:26:11.067 --> 01:26:13.027
You really think I wouldn't
find out that you were

01:26:13.051 --> 01:26:14.632
just totally screwing me,

01:26:14.633 --> 01:26:16.233
fucking with me, using me?

01:26:17.133 --> 01:26:18.733
You deserved everything you got.

01:26:19.633 --> 01:26:20.633
Burn in hell.

01:26:28.133 --> 01:26:31.300
(deep menacing music)

01:26:47.467 --> 01:26:49.400
(thud)

01:26:51.433 --> 01:26:54.966
And you, you sloppy
motherfucker.

01:26:54.967 --> 01:26:57.799
You left Sandy's blood all
over the fucking place.

01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:59.599
I saw it all dried up
all over the house,

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:02.232
all over doorknobs, walls,
all over the fucking place.

01:27:02.233 --> 01:27:04.099
Are you fucking kidding me,

01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:05.600
you think nobody would notice?

01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:11.600
Fucking Sandy.

01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:14.240
Did you think I wouldn't
find out you were

01:27:14.264 --> 01:27:15.399
totally using me?

01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:17.666
Playing me, fucking with me?

01:27:17.667 --> 01:27:19.732
You just think I
wouldn't notice?

01:27:19.733 --> 01:27:21.267
Are you listening to me?

01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:30.766
First of all, thank you.

01:27:30.767 --> 01:27:32.799
Thank you for taking care
of that bartender for me.

01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:37.532
I mean he just walks in here
and fucks Ella just like that?

01:27:37.533 --> 01:27:39.173
I've been trying to
get with he for months

01:27:39.197 --> 01:27:41.830
and he just strolls in
here and ruins everything?

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:46.966
Thank you for noticing
my dislike in that hick,

01:27:46.967 --> 01:27:49.400
hope he begged for
his life, scum.

01:27:55.067 --> 01:27:56.399
(thud)

01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:58.767
Bones in the fucking campfire?

01:27:59.633 --> 01:28:01.266
Are you fucking kidding me,

01:28:01.267 --> 01:28:03.027
you're just gonna burn
up that asshole's body

01:28:03.051 --> 01:28:05.984
right outside when I had guests
sleeping in the house here?

01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:08.932
Are you fucking crazy,

01:28:08.933 --> 01:28:11.013
what if any of them got up
in the middle of the night

01:28:11.037 --> 01:28:13.066
to go pee and they
look outside the window

01:28:13.067 --> 01:28:16.466
and see you cooking human
flesh on a fucking campfire?

01:28:16.467 --> 01:28:17.699
You fucking moron,

01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:19.599
I should just kill you
right here at the table

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.067
for having shit for brains.

01:28:25.567 --> 01:28:27.432
And then there's Ella.

01:28:27.433 --> 01:28:30.499
What the fuck are you doing
with her up in the barn

01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:32.699
all day long, are
you kidding me?

01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:35.132
You don't think I saw
you turning lights

01:28:35.133 --> 01:28:36.666
on and off up there,

01:28:36.667 --> 01:28:38.467
I was fucking looking
in the window.

01:28:40.567 --> 01:28:43.266
How the fuck do you expect
to keep up with this killing

01:28:43.267 --> 01:28:45.399
without somebody finding out?

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.199
I mean, it's just
really fucking sloppy,

01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:50.099
I mean what if Tiffani
was looking in the window,

01:28:50.100 --> 01:28:52.332
she woulda freaked the fuck out.

01:28:52.333 --> 01:28:54.399
The last thing I need
are chicks running around

01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:55.880
the property and we
have to catch them

01:28:55.904 --> 01:28:58.899
just so we can kill them.

01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:00.466
It's just really fucking sloppy

01:29:00.467 --> 01:29:02.666
I mean, how embarrassing.

01:29:02.667 --> 01:29:05.599
Nora would be ashamed if
she was here right now,

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:08.333
if she saw how half
assed you are sometimes.

01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:15.867
Why did you have
to leave us, Nora?

01:29:18.333 --> 01:29:20.132
Why did you have to go
over to Mr. Welman's

01:29:20.133 --> 01:29:21.133
house that night?

01:29:22.433 --> 01:29:23.567
What did he say to you?

01:29:24.533 --> 01:29:26.132
What did he do to you?

01:29:26.133 --> 01:29:27.699
Did he touch you?

01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:30.533
Huh? Did he fucking touch you?

01:29:35.300 --> 01:29:38.232
I'll tell you what we
did to Mr. Welman, Nora.

01:29:38.233 --> 01:29:40.132
We waited 'till he
least expected it

01:29:40.133 --> 01:29:41.367
and broke into his house.

01:29:42.833 --> 01:29:45.932
Same house where he took your
innocent little life from us.

01:29:45.933 --> 01:29:48.432
We gagged that motherfucker
before he knew what hit him,

01:29:48.433 --> 01:29:51.099
that wiry little
fuck gagged him.

01:29:51.100 --> 01:29:52.100
That murderer.

01:29:54.067 --> 01:29:55.600
Heroin is such a great drug.

01:29:57.067 --> 01:29:59.066
It just leaves you wide
awake and able to take

01:29:59.067 --> 01:30:00.333
some really horrible shit.

01:30:01.667 --> 01:30:04.399
And that's what we
wanted for Mr. Welman,

01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:05.467
really horrible shit.

01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:09.232
We tied him up in his
very own living room

01:30:09.233 --> 01:30:11.299
and preceded to
amputate his limbs

01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:14.432
limb by limb, one by one,

01:30:14.433 --> 01:30:16.532
while he is just staring
up at us in shock

01:30:16.533 --> 01:30:19.166
that he's not even
able to feel any of it,

01:30:19.167 --> 01:30:21.832
lying there on his
living room floor

01:30:21.833 --> 01:30:24.199
sobbing like a
four year old boy.

01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:26.966
Well good, good riddance
to you Mr. Welman,

01:30:26.967 --> 01:30:30.800
may you burn in
hell, burn in hell.

01:30:33.167 --> 01:30:35.066
(crying) I'm sorry sweet
brother for slapping

01:30:35.067 --> 01:30:36.067
you like that.

01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:39.633
You know it's for
your own good, right?

01:30:40.833 --> 01:30:42.133
'Cause I love you brother,

01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:45.533
sweet, sweet brother.

01:30:47.433 --> 01:30:49.533
(crying)

01:30:52.367 --> 01:30:54.967
You and me, we
make a great team.

01:30:57.133 --> 01:30:58.533
I think Nora would be proud.

01:31:01.333 --> 01:31:02.866
Thank you for being my brother,

01:31:02.867 --> 01:31:04.400
for doing the work that you do.

01:31:06.067 --> 01:31:07.833
We're making the
world a better place.

01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:12.199
That's all that Nora
would want us to do.

01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:14.467
I just wish you was here
to see us right now.

01:31:16.767 --> 01:31:20.067
Okay, I'm sorry, I
keep going on and on.

01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:25.300
So here's to us,

01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:27.200
two bro's

01:31:28.233 --> 01:31:29.700
making a difference
in the world.

01:31:31.633 --> 01:31:34.066
May we continue to do
the good work for as long

01:31:34.067 --> 01:31:35.400
as the universe will let us.

01:31:37.067 --> 01:31:38.567
Oh and thank you for Tiffani.

01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:42.800
It's what beautiful work you do.

01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:47.332
I just hope I can get the
bloodstains outta the bathtub,

01:31:47.333 --> 01:31:49.466
(giggles)

01:31:49.467 --> 01:31:50.467
but don't worry.

01:31:51.767 --> 01:31:54.333
No-one will ever find out
what you do, what we do.

01:31:56.100 --> 01:32:00.267
For Nora, nobody ever, and
I will make sure of it.

01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:05.200
You can count on it.

01:32:06.833 --> 01:32:08.300
So, sweet brother,

01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:12.800
with glasses held
high, let us toast

01:32:13.833 --> 01:32:14.833
to family

01:32:15.633 --> 01:32:16.633
forever.

01:32:18.067 --> 01:32:20.567
(glasses ding)

01:32:37.433 --> 01:32:40.333
(knocking on door)

01:32:44.133 --> 01:32:46.733
(creepy music)

01:33:05.933 --> 01:33:07.066
Can I help you?

01:33:07.067 --> 01:33:08.333
- Hi, I'm John.

01:33:10.100 --> 01:33:11.666
- John?

01:33:11.667 --> 01:33:12.667
- Ella's boyfriend,

01:33:13.667 --> 01:33:14.667
ex boyfriend.

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:17.600
I was just wondering
is she here?

01:33:19.933 --> 01:33:21.800
I thought I saw her
come up this way.

01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:25.067
- Oh, that John, got it.

01:33:26.667 --> 01:33:28.499
All the way up here
in the country able to

01:33:28.500 --> 01:33:30.067
track down sweet Ella I see.

01:33:31.067 --> 01:33:33.067
Well yeah, of course she's here.

01:33:34.433 --> 01:33:35.533
- Well, can I see her?

01:33:36.767 --> 01:33:37.767
- Yep, sure.

01:33:38.900 --> 01:33:39.900
Come right in.

01:33:42.067 --> 01:33:44.800
(menacing music)

01:34:03.067 --> 01:34:05.533
(door closes)

01:34:10.733 --> 01:34:14.233
(John screaming horridly)

01:34:16.633 --> 01:34:19.800
(creepy piano music)

01:34:20.305 --> 01:34:26.252
