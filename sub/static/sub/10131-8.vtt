16:17.101 --> 16:19.604
- Alright.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.314
[muffled]

16:19.646 --> 16:21.314
And I'll go talk to Stephanie.

16:21.355 --> 16:23.065
Whoa, whoa, wait.

16:21.355 --> 16:23.065
I'll talk to Stephanie.

16:23.107 --> 16:25.777
- Here, you take Michelle.

16:23.107 --> 16:25.777
- Okay.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.987
Oh, by the way, you got

16:25.819 --> 16:27.987
a bottle stuck on your tongue.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.332
[muffled]

16:37.580 --> 16:39.332
Another miracle..

16:42.335 --> 16:44.420
[imitating trumpet fanfare]

16:46.422 --> 16:48.174
...of Thanksgiving!

16:50.009 --> 16:51.427
Turkey!

16:54.681 --> 16:56.098
Dad, you don't have to tell me.

16:56.140 --> 16:59.393
I know I ruined

16:56.140 --> 16:59.393
Thanksgiving for everyone.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.729
You didn't ruin anything.

17:01.771 --> 17:04.106
I let mom down.

17:04.148 --> 17:05.358
Why?

17:05.399 --> 17:07.360
Because of the turkey?

17:07.401 --> 17:10.822
D.J., mom knew Thanksgiving

17:07.401 --> 17:10.822
wasn't about turkeys.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.782
It's about family

17:12.824 --> 17:15.660
and about being thankful

17:12.824 --> 17:15.660
for what we have.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.996
I'm thankful I've got you.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.122
You're the one who pulled us

17:18.037 --> 17:20.122
all together tonight.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.168
You're just trying

17:21.708 --> 17:24.168
to make me feel better.

17:24.210 --> 17:27.087
- Is it working?

17:24.210 --> 17:27.087
- No.

17:27.129 --> 17:30.341
You think you feel bad.

17:27.129 --> 17:30.341
I feel worse.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.844
- You couldn't.

17:30.383 --> 17:32.844
- Oh, yeah?

17:32.886 --> 17:34.721
Wait till I tell you

17:32.886 --> 17:34.721
what's been going on.

17:34.762 --> 17:37.682
I felt so bad

17:34.762 --> 17:37.682
about your frozen turkey

17:37.724 --> 17:41.227
that I offered those ladies

17:37.724 --> 17:41.227
$200 for theirs.

17:41.268 --> 17:43.521
Dad, that's crazy.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.898
You should've just

17:43.563 --> 17:44.898
told me the truth

17:44.939 --> 17:47.525
and given<i> me</i> the $200.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.612
And that would've

17:49.736 --> 17:51.612
made me feel better.

17:53.364 --> 17:55.742
Thanks for making

17:53.364 --> 17:55.742
me feel better.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.618
You're welcome.

17:58.870 --> 18:02.331
Sometimes you remind me

17:58.870 --> 18:02.331
so much of your mom.

18:02.373 --> 18:05.376
You always have a smile

18:02.373 --> 18:05.376
for me when I need one.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.211
Yeah, well, like mom said

18:07.253 --> 18:09.422
smiles are free,

18:07.253 --> 18:09.422
so give them away.

18:14.677 --> 18:17.346
(Steph)

18:14.677 --> 18:17.346
'Uncle Jesse,

18:14.677 --> 18:17.346
are you still here?'

18:17.388 --> 18:18.556
No, I left.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.140
You can come out

18:18.598 --> 18:20.140
of the closet now.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.769
'Nice try.'

18:22.810 --> 18:25.980
Alright, that's it. I'm coming

18:22.810 --> 18:25.980
in there with you. Look out.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.191
Whoa, ah. Ow.

18:31.027 --> 18:33.571
[grunts]

18:33.613 --> 18:35.155
Hi.

18:35.197 --> 18:37.450
I broke the pie.

18:37.491 --> 18:40.661
Oh, that's alright. People

18:37.491 --> 18:40.661
break things all the time.

18:40.703 --> 18:43.330
It's okay, no big deal.

18:40.703 --> 18:43.330
Everybody makes mistakes.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.083
Not pie mistakes.

18:45.124 --> 18:48.252
Even pie mistakes.

18:45.124 --> 18:48.252
You know what?

18:48.294 --> 18:50.755
I'm gonna show you a mistake

18:48.294 --> 18:50.755
I made when I was your age.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.548
Hop on my back. Come on, I'll

18:50.797 --> 18:52.548
give you a piggyback ride.

18:52.590 --> 18:55.134
Hop on. There we go.

18:55.175 --> 18:57.177
It's kind of fun

18:55.175 --> 18:57.177
hanging out in the closet.

18:57.219 --> 18:59.263
You don't get out much, do you?

19:01.515 --> 19:03.225
Alright, come here.

19:03.267 --> 19:06.270
Now you settle down here

19:03.267 --> 19:06.270
and be prepared

19:06.312 --> 19:08.188
to be amazed at my stupidity.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.231
Here, come on,

19:08.230 --> 19:09.231
sit on my lap.

19:09.273 --> 19:11.150
- Okay.

19:09.273 --> 19:11.150
- Alright.

19:11.191 --> 19:12.902
Take a look at that.

19:12.944 --> 19:14.278
Who's that goofy-looking guy

19:14.320 --> 19:16.656
with silly hair and big ears?

19:19.033 --> 19:21.160
I don't have big ears.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.621
They're fine now that

19:21.201 --> 19:23.621
your head's bigger.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.458
Why is your hair so lopsided?

19:27.500 --> 19:28.793
Well, that's the thing, see?

19:28.835 --> 19:30.628
When I was five

19:28.835 --> 19:30.628
and your mom was ten

19:30.670 --> 19:32.130
I let her cut my hair

19:30.670 --> 19:32.130
because she said

19:32.171 --> 19:33.798
she was in beauty school.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.634
- And you believed her?

19:33.840 --> 19:36.634
- Well, I said I was five.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.512
I'm five and I

19:36.676 --> 19:39.512
wouldn't fall for that.

19:39.553 --> 19:42.056
Well, maybe you're just

19:39.553 --> 19:42.056
a little smarter than I am.

19:42.098 --> 19:44.183
Huh? You a little

19:42.098 --> 19:44.183
uncle biter, huh?

19:45.559 --> 19:47.854
- Look at this one.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.854
- Oh, yeah.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.271
Hey.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.315
Who's that little girl with you?

19:53.818 --> 19:55.778
That's your mommy.

19:55.820 --> 19:58.280
She's pretty, isn't she?

19:58.322 --> 19:59.907
Yeah.

19:59.949 --> 20:02.451
What's she holding?

20:02.493 --> 20:04.912
Well, in one hand

20:02.493 --> 20:04.912
she's holding her scissors

20:04.954 --> 20:07.581
and in the other hand, she's

20:04.954 --> 20:07.581
holding about 95% of my hair.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.000
[Steph laughing]

20:09.042 --> 20:11.210
Oh, yeah, that's

20:09.042 --> 20:11.210
for Halloween, huh?

20:11.251 --> 20:13.046
Hey. How you guys doing?

20:13.087 --> 20:14.421
- We're cool.

20:13.087 --> 20:14.421
- We're fine.

20:14.463 --> 20:15.965
Let's go have some black turkey

20:16.007 --> 20:17.508
and some pie a la floor.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.721
Okay but can we make a new pie?

20:21.762 --> 20:23.097
Sure, Steph.

20:23.139 --> 20:24.849
I promise not to drop it.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.143
And I promise not to freeze it.

20:28.602 --> 20:29.979
- Okay, let's go.

20:28.602 --> 20:29.979
- Okay.

20:30.021 --> 20:31.313
Come on, let's go eat.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.481
I'm hungry.

20:34.817 --> 20:37.153
You missed a great

20:34.817 --> 20:37.153
thanksgiving, sis.

20:38.529 --> 20:41.615
- You coming?

20:38.529 --> 20:41.615
- Yeah. Yeah, let's go.

20:41.657 --> 20:44.744
Wait, look at this.

20:44.785 --> 20:48.081
I forgot how much the girls look

20:44.785 --> 20:48.081
like Pam when she was their age.

20:48.122 --> 20:51.042
Yeah, right.

20:48.122 --> 20:51.042
Come on, let's go, man.

20:51.084 --> 20:53.086
Wait a second. You wanna talk?

20:53.127 --> 20:55.295
No. Why would I wanna talk?

20:53.127 --> 20:55.295
Come on, let's go.

20:55.337 --> 20:58.424
Jesse, it's okay

20:55.337 --> 20:58.424
if you're hurting.

20:58.465 --> 21:00.509
I'm not hurting,

20:58.465 --> 21:00.509
I'm hungry. I wanna go eat.

21:00.551 --> 21:02.678
Let's go, please.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.304
You know, I hadn't

21:02.720 --> 21:04.304
thought about this

21:04.346 --> 21:06.390
but this must be

21:04.346 --> 21:06.390
real hard on you.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.559
You've spent more Thanksgivings

21:06.432 --> 21:08.559
with Pam than any of us.

21:08.601 --> 21:09.936
Hey, what does it take

21:08.601 --> 21:09.936
to get through to you?

21:09.977 --> 21:11.812
I don't wanna have

21:09.977 --> 21:11.812
this conversation, okay?

21:11.854 --> 21:13.606
So leave me alone.

21:13.647 --> 21:16.400
Okay. Fine.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.527
I'll be just moseying along.

21:18.569 --> 21:20.196
But if you wanna talk..

21:20.238 --> 21:21.864
...you know my home number.

21:24.867 --> 21:27.161
When is it going

21:24.867 --> 21:27.161
to stop hurting, man?

21:27.203 --> 21:29.288
[instrumental music]

21:31.290 --> 21:33.584
I-I keep thinking

21:31.290 --> 21:33.584
the pain's gonna go away

21:33.626 --> 21:36.254
but it doesn't.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.756
When I see pictures of her,

21:36.295 --> 21:38.756
I think of her..

21:40.174 --> 21:42.760
I get this feeling.

21:40.174 --> 21:42.760
This empt..

21:44.929 --> 21:46.973
[sighs]

21:47.932 --> 21:50.601
I know that feeling, Jesse.

21:50.643 --> 21:53.353
And I don't think it ever

21:50.643 --> 21:53.353
completely goes away.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.315
Sometimes it's easier

21:56.356 --> 21:59.152
but on days like this,

21:56.356 --> 21:59.152
it's real hard.

21:59.193 --> 22:01.821
But you don't have to

21:59.193 --> 22:01.821
go through this alone.

22:04.949 --> 22:06.742
I'm missing her, man.

22:08.286 --> 22:11.247
It's, it's hard

22:08.286 --> 22:11.247
for me to talk about it.

22:13.291 --> 22:16.376
Talking about it,

22:13.291 --> 22:16.376
that's what helps me.

22:16.418 --> 22:18.671
Talking about the memories.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.464
That's what keeps her

22:18.712 --> 22:20.464
in your heart.

22:23.134 --> 22:25.219
- Yeah?

22:23.134 --> 22:25.219
- Yeah.

22:31.391 --> 22:32.893
You know, everybody

22:31.391 --> 22:32.893
knows the story about

22:32.935 --> 22:34.854
how I got my hair

22:32.935 --> 22:34.854
all chopped up and everything

22:34.895 --> 22:37.857
but I bet you don't know

22:34.895 --> 22:37.857
how I retaliated.

22:38.732 --> 22:40.943
Look at this.

22:40.985 --> 22:43.821
Did you ever see your wife

22:40.985 --> 22:43.821
with red, white and blue hair?

22:43.863 --> 22:45.781
I think she looks cute.

22:45.823 --> 22:46.866
How'd you do this?

22:46.907 --> 22:48.159
Well, picture this, man.

22:48.201 --> 22:49.576
It was the middle of the night.

22:49.618 --> 22:52.370
Two things of finger-paints

22:49.618 --> 22:52.370
and vanilla pudding.

22:52.412 --> 22:54.456
[laughing]

22:54.498 --> 22:56.876
I was a wicked little

22:54.498 --> 22:56.876
five year old, wasn't I?

22:58.752 --> 23:00.296
I'm glad you're here, Jesse.

23:03.423 --> 23:05.467
Lord, as we gather

23:03.423 --> 23:05.467
this Thanksgiving

23:05.509 --> 23:08.386
we wanna thank you

23:05.509 --> 23:08.386
for this bountiful

23:08.428 --> 23:11.307
yet slightly overcooked,

23:08.428 --> 23:11.307
reheated meal.

23:11.349 --> 23:12.933
(all)

23:11.349 --> 23:12.933
Amen!

23:12.975 --> 23:14.768
But what we're

23:12.975 --> 23:14.768
most thankful for

23:14.810 --> 23:16.562
is being part of a family

23:16.603 --> 23:17.897
who really loves each other.

23:17.938 --> 23:19.606
(all)

23:17.938 --> 23:19.606
Amen!

23:19.648 --> 23:21.234
And god bless my mom and dad

23:21.275 --> 23:22.400
who are in Orange County

23:22.442 --> 23:24.904
with all my dad's

23:22.442 --> 23:24.904
goofy relatives.

23:24.945 --> 23:26.322
(all)

23:24.945 --> 23:26.322
Amen!

23:26.364 --> 23:28.032
And I'd just like to say

23:26.364 --> 23:28.032
that I'm happy

23:28.074 --> 23:29.658
to be a part of this family

23:29.700 --> 23:33.453
and God bless my dad

23:29.700 --> 23:33.453
and his third wife..

23:33.495 --> 23:34.788
...Janice.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.165
And to my mom who's on a

23:36.207 --> 23:37.666
Thanksgiving gambling junket

23:37.708 --> 23:39.210
to Atlantic City.

23:39.252 --> 23:40.336
7 come 11, mom.

23:40.378 --> 23:41.837
(all)

23:40.378 --> 23:41.837
Amen!

23:41.879 --> 23:43.505
Carve the turkey, dad.

23:43.547 --> 23:44.798
My pleasure.

23:45.716 --> 23:47.343
Okay, who wants

23:45.716 --> 23:47.343
white meat?

23:47.385 --> 23:49.970
- I do. I want some!

23:47.385 --> 23:49.970
- Me.

23:51.055 --> 23:52.181
Scratch the white meat.

23:52.223 --> 23:53.431
We have dark meat
