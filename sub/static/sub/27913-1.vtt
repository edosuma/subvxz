00:20.054 --> 00:21.755
My name's Peter.

00:21.789 --> 00:24.658
This is my best friend, Dave.
- Hey.

00:24.692 --> 00:28.229
This our
friend, George.

00:28.262 --> 00:29.697
- What are you doing?

00:29.730 --> 00:32.665
- Well, I was just setting
the scene, introducing myself,

00:32.700 --> 00:36.170
my friends, trying to keep
things a little exciting.

00:36.204 --> 00:37.205
- Don't do that.

00:37.238 --> 00:40.508
I know who you are, Peter.
- Oh.

00:40.541 --> 00:41.375
Okay.

00:42.610 --> 00:43.544
Whatever.

00:43.577 --> 00:46.214
- Peter, why are you here?

00:46.247 --> 00:48.249
- I really have no idea.

00:50.351 --> 00:51.819
- Has something happened?

00:53.187 --> 00:55.756
- Yeah, you could say that.

00:55.789 --> 00:58.192
- Why don't you tell me
what has happened, Peter.

00:58.226 --> 01:00.494
- Okay, but if I'm gonna tell
you everything that happened,

01:00.528 --> 01:03.197
the first thing you need
to know about is the cabin.

01:04.732 --> 01:07.135
And, this is the cabin.

01:07.168 --> 01:09.137
Every summer, Dave, George
and I go to the cabin

01:09.170 --> 01:11.539
and have the time of our lives:

01:11.572 --> 01:14.442
drinking, playing
games, more drinking,

01:14.475 --> 01:16.177
George trying to kill me--

01:16.210 --> 01:17.445
- George tried to kill you?

01:17.478 --> 01:18.712
- Well, yeah, sure, of course,

01:18.746 --> 01:21.315
but that was only
because I just...

01:21.349 --> 01:23.717
Where to start, where to start.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.627
I guess, looking back,
it really all started

01:33.661 --> 01:36.130
the day of Steve's
Halloween party.

01:36.164 --> 01:37.131
- What are you gonna be,
what are you gonna be,

01:37.165 --> 01:38.031
what are you gonna be,
what are you gonna be,

01:38.065 --> 01:39.333
what are you gonna be?

01:39.367 --> 01:39.900
- Vampire.
- Terrible.

01:39.933 --> 01:40.734
- What?

01:40.768 --> 01:42.136
Surprise hug.

01:43.204 --> 01:44.305
- What are you gonna be?

01:44.338 --> 01:45.839
- That's a surprise, too.
- All right.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.175
- Hey, buddy, did you ask
out that mystery chick yet?

01:47.208 --> 01:48.108
Not yet.

01:48.142 --> 01:49.377
I had tried
to ask her out before

01:49.410 --> 01:51.512
with mixed results.
- Yeah?

01:51.545 --> 01:53.314
Listen, I don't know
how you got this number,

01:53.347 --> 01:54.915
I don't care whose
father you are,

01:54.948 --> 01:57.318
stop calling this
office, all right?

01:57.351 --> 01:59.153
And, love you, Dad, bye.

02:02.256 --> 02:03.757
Hi?
- Oh, uh, hi.

02:03.791 --> 02:04.625
Hi, Susie.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.295
Halloween,

02:09.430 --> 02:10.764
Halloween party.

02:12.500 --> 02:16.437
I'm going to a Halloween
party, tonight.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.706
- You must be very excited.

02:20.774 --> 02:24.712
Well, these files aren't
gonna file themselves.

02:24.745 --> 02:27.915
- Uh huh, they must
be very important.

02:31.985 --> 02:32.820
- Hello?

02:34.222 --> 02:35.923
Who the fuck is Joseph?

02:36.857 --> 02:38.359
Oh, you're Joseph.

02:39.560 --> 02:40.661
- Oh, not yet, what
are you waiting for?

02:40.694 --> 02:41.895
It's so easy.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.664
Just be confident
and assert yourself.

02:43.697 --> 02:46.434
I've told you this
before, watch.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.473
Hi.
- Fuck off.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.509
- My name's George Sullivan.

02:55.543 --> 02:57.311
Do you watch the show Friends?

02:57.345 --> 02:58.412
- I don't have a TV.

02:58.446 --> 02:59.313
Do you
like to eat food?

02:59.347 --> 03:00.948
- I actually love food.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.816
- So do I, do you want
to get dinner sometime?

03:02.850 --> 03:03.751
- Yeah, why not?

03:03.784 --> 03:04.718
- Okay, what's your name?

03:04.752 --> 03:06.654
- Jade, hi.
- Jade, okay.

03:06.687 --> 03:07.855
Find me on Facebook, okay?
- Okay.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.290
- It's George Sullivan.

03:09.323 --> 03:10.258
- George Sullivan?
- Right.

03:10.291 --> 03:11.559
- Bye, George Sullivan.

03:11.592 --> 03:12.960
- You are the master,
how do you do that?

03:12.993 --> 03:13.961
- It's just a matter
of confidence.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.363
It works on guys, too.

03:15.396 --> 03:16.297
- What?
- Huh?

03:16.330 --> 03:17.831
- Are you still seeing Carol?

03:17.865 --> 03:18.966
- No.
- I thought you liked her.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.301
- I did.

03:20.334 --> 03:21.134
Now, I like somebody else.

03:21.168 --> 03:21.835
- You ever think
you'll meet someone

03:21.869 --> 03:23.471
who you don't dump in a month?

03:23.504 --> 03:25.639
- No, my old Pappy told
me, "Rent, don't buy."

03:25.673 --> 03:27.875
- You told me your old
Pappy was an idiot.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.944
- Yeah, but he's
like family to me.

03:30.978 --> 03:32.012
- You guys still goin
to Steve's, right?

03:32.045 --> 03:32.980
- Yeah, wouldn't miss it.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.348
- Okay, I'll see you there.

03:34.382 --> 03:36.717
I have some business
to attend to.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.018
- I'm gonna ask her
out, I'm doing it.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.887
- Who?
- Susie!

03:39.920 --> 03:40.788
- Oh, the mystery girl?

03:40.821 --> 03:41.955
- That's right.
- Okay.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.558
- She's sitting right over
there and talking to George.

03:44.592 --> 03:45.493
She's talking to George.

03:45.526 --> 03:46.994
Why is she talking to George?

03:47.027 --> 03:49.029
- Oh, my God, you're so
adorable, like a dolphin.

03:51.499 --> 03:52.966
Seriously, though, I'm
going to a party tonight

03:53.000 --> 03:54.402
at my friend Steve's and
I want you to be my date,

03:54.435 --> 03:55.636
so say, "Yes."

03:55.669 --> 03:57.004
- I don't know.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.539
- Say, "Yes."

03:59.740 --> 04:01.675
Yes.

04:01.709 --> 04:02.943
- All right.

04:02.976 --> 04:05.012
- All right, excellent,
eight o'clock.

04:05.045 --> 04:07.281
- Sure, why not?
- Great.

04:07.315 --> 04:08.349
Hi!

04:08.382 --> 04:09.917
- Oh, Peter, hi.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.419
You know Peter?

04:11.452 --> 04:12.420
- Yeah, we work together.

04:12.453 --> 04:13.654
- Hi!
- Smooth.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.689
Hi, I'm Dave; I'm Peter
and George's friend.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.358
- Hi.

04:17.391 --> 04:20.594
- So, so, so Susie, how
do, how do you know George?

04:20.628 --> 04:21.695
- Oh, we just met.

04:21.728 --> 04:22.630
- Just met?

04:22.663 --> 04:24.432
You just met, that's insane.

04:24.465 --> 04:25.433
Did you hear that, Dave?

04:25.466 --> 04:26.467
They just met.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.701
- I heard.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.437
- Susie's coming with
me to Steve's party.

04:29.470 --> 04:30.671
- Is she?

04:30.704 --> 04:31.705
That is great.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.407
That's, that's great.

04:33.441 --> 04:35.008
- What's his problem?

04:36.410 --> 04:37.945
- Just a matter of
confidence, like I said.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.713
Now, ask out that mystery girl.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.349
- I'll be sure to do that.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.450
- See you later.

04:42.483 --> 04:43.717
Shall we?
- Okay.

04:43.751 --> 04:44.618
- I'm not going.

04:44.652 --> 04:45.453
- Yes, you are.

04:45.486 --> 04:46.654
- No, I'm really not.

04:46.687 --> 04:47.888
- No, you gotta go;
you'll have fun.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.323
If you don't, we can
leave, I promise.

04:49.357 --> 04:50.324
- You'll leave if I'm
not having a good time?

04:50.358 --> 04:51.359
- I promise.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.394
Fine.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.365
I'm not having a good time.

04:57.398 --> 04:58.366
What?

04:59.400 --> 05:01.068
- I'm not having a good time.

05:01.101 --> 05:03.737
- We've only been
here five minutes.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.873
All right, look, I'm going
to tell you this as a friend,

05:05.906 --> 05:08.041
but staring at two people
making out at a party

05:08.075 --> 05:09.643
is really weird.

05:09.677 --> 05:10.944
- You're right.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.079
Can you believe him?

05:12.112 --> 05:14.014
I said I was dressing
as a vampire,

05:14.047 --> 05:15.115
so what does he do?

05:15.148 --> 05:17.718
He dresses as a vampire,
only, he's a sexy vampire.

05:17.751 --> 05:18.586
You think
George is sexy?

05:18.619 --> 05:19.853
What, no!

05:19.887 --> 05:21.054
Hey look,
it doesn't matter,

05:21.088 --> 05:22.222
'cause how long hae
we known George?

05:22.255 --> 05:25.626
And, in all that time, how
long has he been with a girl,

05:25.659 --> 05:27.561
maybe a month at the most?

05:27.595 --> 05:28.429
So, just relax.

05:28.462 --> 05:29.663
It's fine.

05:29.697 --> 05:32.065
Let's have fun, 'cause
not to sound cliche,

05:32.099 --> 05:33.967
but there are are plenty
more fish in the sea.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.470
And, by sea, I mean this party

05:36.504 --> 05:39.773
and by girls, I
mean fish, right?

05:39.807 --> 05:41.742
So, let's see each
other at the bar.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.343
You go, yeah, yeah.

05:44.445 --> 05:45.713
- All right, I'll see you there.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.548
* All I know to make you

05:47.581 --> 05:51.118
* Make it easy to say no to me

05:51.151 --> 05:52.953
- Who are we staring at?

05:52.986 --> 05:57.791
- And, that, that is the
first time I met Nancy.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.026
And, I, I didn't
know it at the time,

05:59.059 --> 06:01.395
but she almost didn't
even come to the party.

06:01.429 --> 06:02.430
- Uh, Nancy?

06:02.463 --> 06:03.597
Oh, close your eyes.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.766
- Seriously?
- Seriously, close 'em.

06:05.799 --> 06:08.035
- Uh, fine, they're closed.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.538
- Okay, open them.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.109
* What do you think?

06:16.143 --> 06:17.645
- Adorable.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.413
- What are you gonna wear?

06:19.447 --> 06:20.814
- Uh, where?

06:20.848 --> 06:22.483
- To the costume party.

06:22.516 --> 06:25.085
- Uh, right, the costume party.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.087
Um, about that.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.490
- Mary?
- I can't go.

06:29.523 --> 06:30.691
- Oh, why?

06:30.724 --> 06:33.093
No, the only reason I said
I'd go to this stupid party is

06:33.126 --> 06:34.628
'cause you said you were going.

06:34.662 --> 06:36.129
- I know, I really wanted to go.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.297
- Okay, then go!

06:37.330 --> 06:40.701
I, I, I am literally begging
you, please do not make me

06:40.734 --> 06:42.169
go to this party alone,
please, please, please,

06:42.202 --> 06:43.203
please, please, please,

06:43.236 --> 06:44.304
please, please.
- Aw.

06:44.337 --> 06:46.139
Oh my God and
now you're laughing at me!

06:46.173 --> 06:48.642
- No, I'm not, I'm taking
this very seriously.

06:48.676 --> 06:50.210
- So, you'll go?

06:50.243 --> 06:51.745
- I, I'm sorry, I can't.

06:51.779 --> 06:52.880
- Why not?

06:52.913 --> 06:54.715
- There was an
explosion in the lab.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.518
Cheryl's in the hospital.
- So?

06:58.519 --> 07:00.588
Uh, she's
pretty banged up.

07:00.621 --> 07:01.889
- It's Cheryl.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.924
- She might not make it.

07:05.526 --> 07:08.929
- Fine, I don't know if I
want to go to the party, now.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.598
- No, don't do that.

07:10.631 --> 07:11.832
You're already all dressed up

07:11.865 --> 07:13.867
in your very cute
ladybug costume.

07:13.901 --> 07:15.703
- It is pretty cute.

07:15.736 --> 07:16.970
It is.

07:17.004 --> 07:17.905
- I don't know.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.640
- You're gonna go to that party,

07:19.673 --> 07:22.910
you're gonna have a great
time for the both of us

07:22.943 --> 07:24.678
and then, tomorrow morning,
you're gonna call me

07:24.712 --> 07:26.680
and tell me all about it.

07:26.714 --> 07:29.116
Come on, do it for
Cheryl.

07:29.149 --> 07:30.083
- Oh, fine.

07:34.622 --> 07:37.190
- I'm wondering when they're
gonna come up for air.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.559
- That's Susie Smith.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.227
Oh, she works in my building.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.696
Could be a while.

07:42.730 --> 07:44.164
She's very pretty.

07:44.197 --> 07:45.566
- Yes, she is.

07:47.568 --> 07:50.538
I guess, I mean, not
as pretty as you.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.207
- I'm Nancy.

07:54.241 --> 07:55.943
- Uh, hi, Peter.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.011
- Nice to meet you, Peter.

07:58.045 --> 08:00.147
- It's nice to meet you, Nancy.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.616
Can I get you a drink?
- Sure.

08:09.623 --> 08:12.092
- She's a lady, but she's a bug.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.732
Oh, fuck.
- It's true.

08:18.766 --> 08:20.601
- You gonna be okay
getting home on your own?

08:20.634 --> 08:21.669
- I'm good, I'm great, I'm good.

08:21.702 --> 08:24.037
Listen, you need to forget
about what's-her-name

08:24.071 --> 08:25.639
because Nancy's hot.

08:25.673 --> 08:26.974
You can't do better than that.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.642
Look at yourself.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.578
Look at you, you mess, she's,
she's way better than you.

08:30.611 --> 08:31.979
Don't tell her.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.582
And, you, be nice to my
friend; he's a nice guy.

08:34.615 --> 08:35.948
He's a really nice guy, just
don't be a meanie, okay?

08:35.982 --> 08:37.150
- I'll do my best.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.217
All right, I love
you.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.186
I love you.
- Oh.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.754
- Be good.

08:40.788 --> 08:42.556
God bless you guys.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.659
- Aw, your friend
really cares about you.

08:45.693 --> 08:46.660
- Yeah, Dave's the best.

08:46.694 --> 08:48.295
I've known him forever, so--

08:48.328 --> 08:50.297
- He would be perfect
for my best friend Mary,

08:50.330 --> 08:53.066
but she is dating some
asshole right now.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.202
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

08:56.637 --> 08:59.106
So, this girl that Dave
wants you to forget about,

08:59.139 --> 09:00.641
it wouldn't be Susie, is it?

09:00.674 --> 09:02.943
Because, she is a
real heart breaker.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.177
- Was I that obvious?

09:04.211 --> 09:05.579
- Well, the way you
were staring at them,

09:05.613 --> 09:07.314
it was either Susie or George

09:07.347 --> 09:09.583
and I hope it's not
George, 'cause--

09:09.617 --> 09:10.217
- It's Susie.

09:11.852 --> 09:14.655
- Look, Nancy, I had
a great time tonight

09:14.688 --> 09:16.890
and I really, really didn't
think I was going to,

09:16.924 --> 09:18.859
so, thank you for that.

09:19.827 --> 09:20.928
You're welcome.

09:26.667 --> 09:29.002
So, this is my place.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.170
Do you want to come up?

09:30.203 --> 09:31.605
- You're not the type of girl

09:31.639 --> 09:32.472
who's just gonna
use me for my body

09:32.505 --> 09:33.841
and I'll never see
you again, are you?

09:33.874 --> 09:34.842
- What body?

09:34.875 --> 09:36.644
- Ouch, oh,
- Oh, ouch.

09:36.677 --> 09:38.946
- Very hurtful, very hurtful.

09:38.979 --> 09:41.181
- You're not getting
rid of me that easy.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.726
- I know, I know, I'm late.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.695
Sorry, had a crazy day at work

09:54.728 --> 09:57.297
and you wouldn't
believe the traffic.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.599
Oh, are we going on a trip?

10:00.734 --> 10:03.370
Then, what's with the bag?

10:03.403 --> 10:05.372
- I'm not happy.

10:05.405 --> 10:06.774
Are you happy?

10:07.675 --> 10:09.877
- What, what's going on?

10:09.910 --> 10:12.379
- This isn't working anymore.

10:12.412 --> 10:14.715
- Are you leaving me?

10:14.748 --> 10:16.817
- Think of it as a
trial separation.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.218
- Oh God, you are leaving me.

10:18.251 --> 10:19.352
I'm not happy.

10:19.386 --> 10:22.122
- You're not happy, so you
just pack your bag and go?

10:22.155 --> 10:24.658
- It's not my bag,
it's your bag.

10:24.692 --> 10:26.694
Why would
you pack my bag?

10:26.727 --> 10:28.261
- I'd like you to leave.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.130
- You're kicking
me out of my house?

10:30.163 --> 10:32.733
- It's our house,
Peter, our house.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.735
- Just talk to me, Nancy.

10:34.768 --> 10:35.869
We've talked.

10:35.903 --> 10:37.404
We've talked so much.

10:37.437 --> 10:38.438
- Yeah, and I thought
things were better.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.207
We, we were meeting
with Dr. Gordon

10:40.240 --> 10:43.176
and he had some
interesting ideas

10:43.210 --> 10:45.679
and I thought thought
things were better.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.215
- They're not.

10:49.783 --> 10:52.219
Peter, you lost your--

10:52.252 --> 10:53.921
- I know, I've
lost a little hair,

10:53.954 --> 10:55.923
but I think it's just thinning.

10:55.956 --> 10:59.760
There's nothing I can
really do about that.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.931
What, what do you want, Nancy?

11:06.834 --> 11:08.235
- Peter, just go.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.735
She just left you?

11:41.769 --> 11:42.803
- Yep.

11:42.836 --> 11:44.104
- She kicked you
out of the house?

11:44.137 --> 11:46.439
- Yes.
- What did you do?

11:46.473 --> 11:48.075
- What do you mean,
what did I do?

11:48.108 --> 11:51.178
- I, I just thought
things were better.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.045
- Me, too.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.148
How many of
those have you had?

11:55.182 --> 11:56.850
- Not enough.

11:56.884 --> 11:59.486
- I'm sure she just needs
a few days to cool off

11:59.519 --> 12:00.553
and then you'll be fine.

12:00.587 --> 12:03.390
You'll be back in the
house before you know it.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.792
- What's with your watch?

12:04.825 --> 12:05.525
- My watch?

12:05.558 --> 12:06.960
- You keep checking your watch.

12:06.994 --> 12:08.428
- It's nothing, it's
just, I got a thing

12:08.461 --> 12:10.530
with Mary and her
parents later, it's okay.

12:10.563 --> 12:14.067
- You're gonna leave me
now, just like Nancy.

12:14.101 --> 12:18.972
- I'm not gonna leave you,
I'm, I'll stay right here.

12:19.006 --> 12:22.475
It's just, we were
planning this for a while

12:22.509 --> 12:25.312
and Mary was looking forward
to it, but it's okay,

12:25.345 --> 12:27.414
I'll stay right here with you

12:27.447 --> 12:30.851
and then she'll realize that
she can do better than me

12:30.884 --> 12:33.220
and she'll leave me and
I'll be alone, just like--

12:33.253 --> 12:34.788
- Forget it, forget it.

12:34.822 --> 12:35.889
Go be with your
girlfriend and her family.

12:37.157 --> 12:39.126
- Thank you, muah,
you're the best.

12:39.159 --> 12:40.493
- You're a terrible friend.

12:40.527 --> 12:41.829
- You don't mean that.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.797
Yes, I do mean
that.

12:43.831 --> 12:45.933
I love you, too.

12:49.236 --> 12:53.406
I will have another
of those and your number.

12:54.241 --> 12:55.943
Fair enough.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.577
You
can't do that, pass.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.013
We were on a break.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.887
Oh, come on, Rachel.

13:06.920 --> 13:07.520
- George?

13:07.554 --> 13:08.555
- What's up?

13:09.923 --> 13:10.991
- We need to talk.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.893
- Okay, talk.

13:12.926 --> 13:15.095
- Well, we've been
together for four years

13:15.128 --> 13:17.898
and I was wondering
if you thought about

13:17.931 --> 13:19.900
where we might be
going as a couple.

13:19.933 --> 13:22.135
- I had a feeling this
conversation was coming.

13:22.169 --> 13:24.471
- All of our friends are
married or getting married.

13:24.504 --> 13:28.441
- False, Dave and Mary, not
married or gettin' married,

13:28.475 --> 13:29.409
like you say.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.312
- They've only been
together for a few months.

13:32.345 --> 13:36.549
- Right, my point is, Dolphin,
they're not married, okay.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.852
Do you ever think
you want to get married?

13:38.886 --> 13:41.188
- Susie, I'm watching Friends.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.590
- George, this is important.

13:46.960 --> 13:47.861
- No.
- No?

13:48.962 --> 13:50.931
You never wanna get married?

13:50.964 --> 13:53.033
So, you don't want to have kids?

13:53.066 --> 13:55.435
- Is this about kids?

13:55.468 --> 13:56.970
'Cause, I promise you,

13:57.004 --> 13:59.639
you do not have to be married
to have children, okay?

13:59.672 --> 14:01.474
This is a medical...

14:02.675 --> 14:04.277
Have you been poking
holes in my condoms?

14:04.311 --> 14:05.946
- What?

14:05.979 --> 14:08.982
- It's a guy's number one
fear, behind alien abduction,

14:09.016 --> 14:11.919
crazy girl pokes holes
in a guy's condoms.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.420
- That has never happened.

14:13.453 --> 14:16.589
- Oh, yeah, it has happened,
'cause I Googled it, okay.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.125
Can I put my program back on?

14:18.158 --> 14:20.193
- And, that's what you think
of me, I would do that,

14:20.227 --> 14:21.929
to what, to trap you?

14:21.962 --> 14:23.130
- It's not what I think of you;

14:23.163 --> 14:25.232
it's just all this marriage
talk gets me thinking, you know?

14:25.265 --> 14:27.467
- And, you think
I'd do that to you?

14:27.500 --> 14:29.336
- I would hope that you wouldn't

14:29.369 --> 14:30.570
and I know that you wouldn't

14:30.603 --> 14:33.941
because I pre-check
all of my condoms

14:33.974 --> 14:36.043
before I apply
them to my harpoon.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.577
- You're so weird.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.279
- That's judgemental.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.413
And, if we're gonna use labels,

14:40.447 --> 14:43.183
which you know I disapprove of,

14:43.216 --> 14:45.552
I'd say that you're awesome.

14:47.220 --> 14:50.958
Let's be honest, okay, I
don't believe in marriage.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.961
- You don't believe in marriage?

14:53.994 --> 14:57.965
I mean, my Dad, who's a
very close relative,

14:59.099 --> 15:00.968
he told me, "Don't
ya ever get married,"

15:01.001 --> 15:04.037
and then my uncle
joined in and...

15:05.172 --> 15:07.240
I don't want to talk about that.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.709
I'm a very sexual being,
is what I'm trying to say.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.112
Oh, you're
a very sexual being?

15:12.145 --> 15:14.181
We haven't had sex in weeks.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.949
- I've grown bored
of you sexually.

15:15.983 --> 15:17.584
Oh, it feels good to say that.

15:17.617 --> 15:18.451
- You're bored of me?

15:18.485 --> 15:19.386
- No, no!

15:19.419 --> 15:20.553
No, I'm not bored of you.

15:20.587 --> 15:24.391
It just, it's just that I'm
bored of making love to you,

15:25.725 --> 15:27.360
but we could fix it.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.029
Oh, believe me, we could fix it.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.731
I've got this friend named
Jamie who is more than willing

15:31.764 --> 15:34.701
to join us in the
bedroom for a menage

15:34.734 --> 15:36.503
and it'll spice things up.

15:36.536 --> 15:39.539
- You want me to have a threesome with some strange woman?

15:39.572 --> 15:44.377
It's not a woman
and we don't have to do it,

15:44.411 --> 15:47.981
but we do have to put
the program back on.

15:48.015 --> 15:51.051
- I obviously have a
lot to think about.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.285
- Was this a fight?

15:54.121 --> 15:56.023
It was a fight.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.059
- Oh, Mary.

15:59.092 --> 15:59.759
- Oh, Dave.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.494
- I like you.
- Oh.

16:02.762 --> 16:04.197
- Hold on, I'm sorry,
- Seriously?

16:04.231 --> 16:05.632
- I'm sorry, it's just Peter.

16:05.665 --> 16:06.733
He keeps calling.

16:06.766 --> 16:09.036
- Hmm, how is Peter?

16:09.069 --> 16:11.071
- It's all right, I mean,
he puts on a brave face,

16:11.104 --> 16:12.705
but you can tell
it's killing him.

16:12.739 --> 16:13.640
How's Nancy?

16:13.673 --> 16:14.774
- Same, I can't believe

16:14.807 --> 16:16.776
they haven't gotten
back together yet.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.412
- I know, but what can you do?

16:19.446 --> 16:21.748
- Is Peter coming to
the cabin next month?

16:21.781 --> 16:23.183
Not if Nancy's coming.

16:23.216 --> 16:26.186
- What if she wasn't coming?
- She is.

16:26.219 --> 16:29.456
- But, what if Peter
thought she wasn't coming?

16:29.489 --> 16:30.323
- Wait.

16:31.758 --> 16:34.761
So, your friends were trying
to trick you and your wife

16:34.794 --> 16:37.297
into spending more
time together?

16:37.330 --> 16:39.766
- Well, sure, when you say it
like that, it sounds insane.

16:43.770 --> 16:44.837
- I don't know.

16:44.871 --> 16:46.773
I really think I should
just stay home this year.

16:46.806 --> 16:49.542
- But, you said you were
coming this weekend.

16:49.576 --> 16:52.145
- I know, it's just that, with
everything that's happened--

16:52.179 --> 16:55.148
- Don't stay home, that's
the worst thing you can do.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.750
Dave wants all of us to
be there this weekend.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.286
I want you to be there.

16:59.319 --> 17:00.753
- We go every year.

17:00.787 --> 17:03.623
- I know, but it's not every
year my wife leaves me.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.592
- I thought it was just
a trial separation.

17:05.625 --> 17:06.759
It is.

17:06.792 --> 17:08.395
The trial's not going great.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.829
- Peter will be there and I
haven't seen Peter in months.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.232
- Peter's not coming.

17:12.265 --> 17:13.665
- Nancy's not coming.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.068
- Why?

17:15.102 --> 17:16.069
Is it because she thinks
I'm gonna be there?

17:16.103 --> 17:17.002
Because you can tell her
I'm not gonna be there,

17:17.036 --> 17:19.138
you should tell her
I'm not gonna be there.

17:19.172 --> 17:20.339
Why not?

17:20.373 --> 17:24.176
- Uh, I don't know,
Dave said he had plans.

17:24.211 --> 17:26.378
So, if he's the only
reason you're not coming,

17:26.413 --> 17:28.348
please come, please.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.783
- No, it's nothing to do
with you, she's got plans.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.353
It's gonna be me and
Mary, George and Susie.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.587
- Susie?

17:34.621 --> 17:35.855
- Yeah, me and Mary,
George and Susie.

17:35.888 --> 17:39.692
- Well, it might be nice
to get out of the city.

17:39.726 --> 17:41.828
- Okay, sure, I guess.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.663
I might be a little late
getting there, though.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.432
- Great, you're not
gonna regret this.

17:45.465 --> 17:46.833
We're gonna have a great time.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.735
- I'll tell Mary;
she'll be thrilled.

17:48.768 --> 17:51.171
- You're absolutely sure
Peter's not going to be there?

17:51.204 --> 17:52.639
- Definitely not.

17:52.672 --> 17:55.175
- And, Dave, you're, you're
sure Nancy's not gonna be there?

17:55.208 --> 17:56.809
- I'm absolutely positive.

17:56.843 --> 17:58.445
- Okay, see you then, bye.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.250
- Who'd Peter have plans with?

18:05.552 --> 18:07.154
- Is Peter coming?

18:07.187 --> 18:08.688
- Yep, isn't she?

18:10.157 --> 18:12.559
- Yep, he'll thank us for this.

18:14.427 --> 18:17.230
He will, they both will.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.498
- So, it was all set.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.533
Nancy and I were both
coming to the cabin

18:20.567 --> 18:22.735
and Susie had gotten
back together with George

18:22.769 --> 18:24.904
after their fight.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.140
- Yep, all right then.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.875
I'll see you soon, bye.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.444
- Who was that?

18:31.478 --> 18:33.280
- That's Dave.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.814
Dave said Peter's in.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.583
- Peter's coming?
- Mm-hmm.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.884
- But, I thought he
wasn't gonna come

18:37.917 --> 18:40.153
because Nancy's gonna be there.

18:40.187 --> 18:42.155
- Nope, Dave said it's all good.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.892
- Why don't we go away
alone together this weekend,

18:46.793 --> 18:49.396
just the two of us,
what do you think?

18:49.429 --> 18:50.697
- What's gotten into you?

18:50.730 --> 18:52.565
- No, I'm, nothing, I mean,

18:52.599 --> 18:54.667
I just want to be
alone with my big man.

18:54.701 --> 18:58.505
- Hmm, well, I haven't seen
Peter in, like, a year,

18:58.538 --> 19:01.174
so, let's just stick
to the original plan

19:01.208 --> 19:03.210
and we'll do that Bermuda
trip you were talking about,

19:03.243 --> 19:04.644
swim with the dolphins.

19:04.677 --> 19:06.213
Okay?
- Great.

19:07.214 --> 19:08.348
- I love you.

19:12.452 --> 19:13.286
- Fuck.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.256
You coming, Honey?

19:16.289 --> 19:18.925
- Yeah, I'll be
there in a minute.

19:18.958 --> 19:19.792
Hey, Mom.

19:21.694 --> 19:22.929
Yeah, I got it.

19:23.963 --> 19:26.933
I'm gonna ask her this weekend.

19:26.966 --> 19:28.301
Yeah, we're heading
out to the cabin

19:28.335 --> 19:30.870
in a little bit.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.171
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

19:36.543 --> 19:37.377
Yeah, no.

19:39.246 --> 19:43.916
No, she has no idea and I'd
like to keep it that way, okay?

19:43.950 --> 19:46.353
All right, I love you too.

19:46.386 --> 19:49.222
I'll see you when I get back.

19:49.256 --> 19:50.056
- Got everything?

19:50.089 --> 19:52.959
Hey,
yeah, you scared me.

19:52.992 --> 19:55.428
- Sorry, who was
that on the phone?

19:55.462 --> 19:57.397
- Um, Steve, from work.

19:58.598 --> 20:00.967
Yeah, I had to tell him
where the paperwork was.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.335
- Oh, that's it?

20:03.703 --> 20:04.671
- Yeah.

20:04.704 --> 20:05.805
You ready to go?

20:05.838 --> 20:07.507
- Sure.
- All right.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.821
- Yoo hoo!

20:21.854 --> 20:23.923
Peter.
- Hey, George!

20:27.294 --> 20:28.761
Susie,
it is so good to--

20:28.795 --> 20:29.629
No need.

20:29.662 --> 20:30.663
- Ah, hooch.

20:33.666 --> 20:34.601
What'd you do, stud?

20:34.634 --> 20:35.468
- What, nothing, why?

20:35.502 --> 20:36.303
What did she say I did?

20:36.336 --> 20:38.538
I didn't do anything.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.039
- Just messing with you.

20:40.072 --> 20:43.943
She's been acting like a real
B-word, all day.

20:43.976 --> 20:45.778
I think she has her period.
- Oh.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.047
She's bleeding from the--

20:48.080 --> 20:51.384
- Oh, no, I get it, yeah.
- Vagina.

20:56.689 --> 20:57.857
- Here you go.

21:03.062 --> 21:05.332
- I think I need a straw.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.970
- Hey, fellas.
- Ooh, hey.

21:11.003 --> 21:12.372
- I can't wait for this weekend.

21:12.405 --> 21:13.640
It's going to be
an amazing time.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.608
- Yep, great time.
- I can feel it.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.344
- Yep, um, I'm starving,

21:17.377 --> 21:18.277
so I'm, I think I'm
gonna go in the kitchen

21:18.311 --> 21:20.313
and see if there's
anything to eat, okay?

21:20.347 --> 21:24.517
So, that's what I'm gonna
do, just go into the kitchen.

21:28.521 --> 21:31.023
- He has no idea that
Nancy's coming, does he?

21:31.057 --> 21:35.462
- Nah, but they'll thank
us, they both will.

21:35.495 --> 21:36.763
- What could go wrong?

21:55.982 --> 21:57.450
Rachel, I love you.

21:57.484 --> 21:58.518
- Where's the suitcase?

21:58.551 --> 22:00.987
- Huh?
- Our fucking rolly bag.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.656
- Oh, right, it's on the,
the first room on the left.

22:03.690 --> 22:05.425
- That's Dave and Mary's room.

22:05.458 --> 22:07.494
Could you go and get it
and put it in our room?

22:07.527 --> 22:09.061
- I'm watching Friends.

22:09.095 --> 22:10.463
Uh, during the commercial, okay?

22:11.431 --> 22:12.632
- Forget it, I'll go do it.

22:12.665 --> 22:13.800
I wouldn't want you
to miss Mr. Chandler.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.402
- You're the best.
- Fuck you.

22:15.435 --> 22:16.969
- Huh?
- Love you.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.438
- Oh, I love you, too.

22:20.106 --> 22:22.409
- He wanted the rolly
bag so he can roll it,

22:23.676 --> 22:25.678
but I'm the one who's
always carrying it.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.083
- Hey, Susie, can I
help you with that bag?

22:31.117 --> 22:32.885
- No, thanks, I've got it.

22:32.919 --> 22:34.153
- Susie, we need to talk
about what happened.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.555
Just ignoring it isn't--

22:35.588 --> 22:37.023
- Nope, can't,
I'm unpacking now.

22:37.056 --> 22:39.158
- Ignoring it isn't
healthy, but sure, later.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.394
- All right, later then.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.602
- Mary, have you seen our bag?

22:49.636 --> 22:51.804
- Uh, last I saw,
it was on the floor,

22:51.838 --> 22:52.772
but the side of the bed.

22:52.805 --> 22:54.407
- No, I put it on the bed.

22:54.441 --> 22:55.842
- See, side of the bed.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.744
No!

22:57.777 --> 22:59.779
I mean, I don't want you
to do that, I'll do that.

22:59.812 --> 23:02.882
I, I want you to
relax this weekend.

23:02.915 --> 23:04.551
Do you want to go for a walk?

23:04.584 --> 23:05.818
- Sure.
- Okay.

23:05.852 --> 23:09.121
Bring your silly hat.
- Ooh, good idea!

23:11.190 --> 23:12.692
Hmm.

23:30.510 --> 23:31.811
- George, George!

23:31.844 --> 23:33.813
George, George.

23:33.846 --> 23:35.515
What's going on, man?

23:35.548 --> 23:36.716
- Steve.
- Yeah.

23:36.749 --> 23:37.850
What's up, man?

23:37.884 --> 23:38.951
- Nothing much, man.

23:38.985 --> 23:40.186
I'm here to party, man.

23:40.219 --> 23:41.488
- Oh, no, no, no.

23:41.521 --> 23:43.756
It's a, it's a couples thing.

23:43.790 --> 23:44.691
- A couples thing?

23:44.724 --> 23:46.493
- Yeah, how about next year,

23:46.526 --> 23:47.694
we lock it up for
the boys, okay?

23:47.727 --> 23:49.862
- Hey, you think you can give
me a ride back to the ferry?

23:49.896 --> 23:51.698
It's two miles
away, I just walked

23:51.731 --> 23:53.566
and the last ferry
leaves in 15 minutes.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.435
- No, I gotta go,
the finish line.

23:59.005 --> 24:01.941
Gotta get, gotta
get to finish line.

24:05.111 --> 24:07.547
- Are you--
- I really wanna--

24:13.085 --> 24:15.021
Finish line!

24:21.260 --> 24:23.696
- Uh, I'm gonna go start dinner.

24:23.730 --> 24:24.631
- Oh, okay.

24:31.871 --> 24:34.574
- That's a lovely hat she has.

24:38.678 --> 24:40.547
- Is Peter here?

24:40.580 --> 24:42.882
- Uh, no, I think he's outside.

24:42.915 --> 24:45.217
- Can I talk to you
about something personal?

24:45.251 --> 24:46.686
- Sure, what's going on?

24:46.719 --> 24:48.087
- It's about Peter.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.956
- All right, spill.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.257
What's going on with you two?

24:51.290 --> 24:53.259
- Nothing, why, what did he say?

24:53.292 --> 24:56.128
- He didn't say anything,
but, for starters,

24:56.162 --> 24:58.230
you're avoiding Peter
like he has the plague.

24:58.264 --> 25:00.166
I thought you and
Peter were friends.

25:00.199 --> 25:01.568
- We are.
- What?

25:05.037 --> 25:06.773
- Something happened.

25:11.744 --> 25:12.645
Dave,
what are you doing?

25:12.679 --> 25:15.582
- Hey, Peter, how are you?

25:16.515 --> 25:18.585
- Um, look, I need
to ask you something

25:18.618 --> 25:20.219
and what I need to ask you
might be vitally important

25:20.252 --> 25:23.623
to my future happiness,
so I need your advice.

25:23.656 --> 25:25.592
- Oh, if it's vitally important
to your future happiness,

25:25.625 --> 25:26.693
how can I refuse?

25:26.726 --> 25:28.595
- Cool, cool, cool, cool.

25:28.628 --> 25:29.829
You can't tell anyone.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.297
You can't tell Mary.

25:31.330 --> 25:33.332
You certainly can't tell George.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.868
- Okay, Peter, what's going on?

25:35.902 --> 25:37.970
- Well, you know how
I had a crush on Susie

25:38.004 --> 25:39.806
before her and George
started dating?

25:39.839 --> 25:41.741
- I think everybody
but Susie knew that.

25:41.774 --> 25:44.143
- Yeah, well,
something happened.

25:44.176 --> 25:45.678
- What happened?

25:45.712 --> 25:47.146
- A couple of weeks ago,

25:47.179 --> 25:49.682
me and George got into
a really bad fight.

25:49.716 --> 25:51.050
- What did you fight over?

25:51.083 --> 25:52.785
- Well, we've been together
for four fucking years,

25:52.819 --> 25:54.320
that's two Summer Olympics,

25:54.353 --> 25:56.322
a girl has expectations.

25:56.355 --> 25:57.389
- Well, sure.

25:57.423 --> 25:59.626
- Look, this is the wedding
album my mother gave me

25:59.659 --> 26:02.662
when I was little and
that's all I've ever wanted.

26:02.695 --> 26:03.796
I take it everywhere I go.

26:03.830 --> 26:06.365
A fairytale wedding
with ice sculptures

26:06.398 --> 26:08.635
and a horse-drawn carriage--

26:08.668 --> 26:10.637
- A castle?
- Yeah.

26:10.670 --> 26:13.139
- That's an actual castle?

26:13.172 --> 26:14.641
- No, it's the Berlin Wall.

26:14.674 --> 26:17.610
Mary, that's not the point.

26:17.644 --> 26:19.078
It doesn't even matter

26:19.111 --> 26:21.714
because George doesn't
even want to get married.

26:21.748 --> 26:23.650
Oh.

26:23.683 --> 26:26.653
In fact, he doesn't
believe in marriage at all.

26:26.686 --> 26:29.622
Anyway, he said some
shit, I said some shit.

26:29.656 --> 26:30.890
- I'm so sorry.

26:30.923 --> 26:32.258
Is everything all right?

26:32.291 --> 26:33.926
- It is, now, but at the time,

26:33.960 --> 26:37.263
it didn't seem like it
was gonna be, so I left.

26:37.296 --> 26:39.131
- What do you mean, you left?

26:39.165 --> 26:41.734
- I left the house
and I went to a bar.

26:41.768 --> 26:43.670
- So, when Nancy left me,
I didn't take it very well.

26:43.703 --> 26:45.672
In fact, most nights, I
went to a bar to get drunk.

26:45.705 --> 26:46.372
- Yeah, I know, I was with you.

26:46.405 --> 26:48.007
- Yeah, but not that night.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.742
I was already pretty
drunk when she walked in.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.243
Who?

26:51.277 --> 26:52.378
Peter was there,
looking miserable as always,

26:52.411 --> 26:56.115
nursing his drink and him
and Nancy had been separated

26:56.148 --> 26:57.216
for a couple of months.

26:57.249 --> 26:59.719
- So, she sits down next
to me, so I buy her a drink

26:59.752 --> 27:01.654
and we start talking and it's
like I can tell her anything

27:01.688 --> 27:02.822
and she can tell me anything.

27:02.855 --> 27:05.992
So, she tells me about this
huge fight her and George had

27:06.025 --> 27:07.426
and she doesn't know what to do.

27:07.459 --> 27:08.427
She was a mess.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.196
- So, I'm telling him things

27:10.229 --> 27:12.732
that I've never
told anyone before

27:12.765 --> 27:14.767
and we're both just
buying each other drinks

27:14.801 --> 27:16.936
and we got pretty drunk.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.370
And, we're standing
outside and I tell her,

27:18.404 --> 27:19.505
I don't want to be alone tonight

27:19.538 --> 27:22.875
and then she tells me she
doesn't want to be alone.

27:22.909 --> 27:24.744
And then, we sort of kissed.

27:24.777 --> 27:26.746
- Whoa, whoa, you
sort of kissed?

27:26.779 --> 27:28.447
You can't sort of kiss; you
either kiss or you don't kiss.

27:28.480 --> 27:29.749
What happened?

27:29.782 --> 27:32.084
- You kissed him?
- Yeah.

27:32.118 --> 27:33.285
- Then what happened?

27:33.319 --> 27:34.320
No, you know what,
don't tell me.

27:34.353 --> 27:35.454
I don't want to know.
- Okay.

27:35.487 --> 27:36.288
- Who kissed who?

27:36.322 --> 27:37.924
- I thought you
didn't want to know.

27:37.957 --> 27:39.425
- I don't, but I'm in
too deep, just spill.

27:39.458 --> 27:40.492
- She kissed me first, but
then, I was kissing her

27:40.526 --> 27:42.995
and then we were both
sort of kissing each other

27:43.029 --> 27:45.097
and then I invited her
back to my apartment.

27:45.131 --> 27:46.465
- You went to his apartment?

27:46.498 --> 27:48.935
- It seemed like a
good idea at the time.

27:48.968 --> 27:50.870
- You slept with Peter?

27:50.903 --> 27:52.138
Well, there wasn't
much sleeping going on,

27:52.171 --> 27:53.405
if you know what I mean.

27:53.439 --> 27:54.807
I don't want
to know what you mean.

27:54.841 --> 27:56.809
- I'm talking about
sex, Dave, lots of sex.

27:56.843 --> 27:57.676
It was great!

27:57.710 --> 27:59.979
It was
awful, I felt terrible.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.480
- Oh, I felt great the next day.

28:01.513 --> 28:02.782
It was like Nancy leaving me
wasn't the end of my life,

28:02.815 --> 28:04.817
but just the
beginning, you know?

28:04.851 --> 28:05.752
- What about George?

28:05.785 --> 28:07.253
- George?

28:07.286 --> 28:08.955
Oh, we weren't thinking much
about George at the time.

28:08.988 --> 28:09.989
- Does George know?

28:10.022 --> 28:11.758
- No, and you can't tell him.

28:11.791 --> 28:13.926
- How could you do
that with Peter?

28:13.960 --> 28:15.494
He's George's friend.

28:15.527 --> 28:16.963
- George is our friend!

28:16.996 --> 28:19.065
- Yes, yes he is,

28:19.098 --> 28:20.833
but he's always been more
your friend than mine.

28:20.867 --> 28:22.368
We all sort of just
hung out together.

28:22.401 --> 28:23.836
- But, you like George.
- I do.

28:23.870 --> 28:27.139
I like him a lot, but I
always liked Susie more.

28:27.173 --> 28:28.340
- Oh, what about Nancy?

28:28.374 --> 28:31.377
- Nancy, Nancy doesn't want me.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.112
Nancy doesn't even
talk to me anymore.

28:33.145 --> 28:34.480
- Peter--
- I know.

28:34.513 --> 28:36.916
I know, but it just,
that night with Susie,

28:36.949 --> 28:40.186
it was like all those old
feelings just came back.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.254
- Do you have
feelings for Peter?

28:42.288 --> 28:44.456
- No, were you even listening?

28:44.490 --> 28:46.893
I had enough to drink
to sink the Titanic,

28:46.926 --> 28:48.795
but that's not the problem.

28:48.828 --> 28:50.162
- Then, what's the problem?

28:50.196 --> 28:52.298
- I think the sick fuck
might be in love with me.

28:52.331 --> 28:54.166
- Anyway, I think
Susie's in love with me.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.835
And, anyway, George only
beat me to asking her out

28:55.868 --> 28:56.936
by, like, five minutes.

28:56.969 --> 28:59.005
- I know, I just can't
believe you slept with Susie.

28:59.038 --> 29:00.873
- Well, we were
both pretty drunk.

29:00.907 --> 29:01.974
- Would you take this seriously?

29:02.008 --> 29:03.976
- I am, I'm taking
it very seriously.

29:04.010 --> 29:06.412
I'm gonna get Susie to dump
George and go out with me.

29:06.445 --> 29:08.514
- No, not this weekend!

29:08.547 --> 29:10.516
- Why, what's so special
about this weekend?

29:10.549 --> 29:12.985
- I'm gonna ask
Mary to marry me.

29:13.019 --> 29:15.154
- Aw, you're gonna
ask Mary to marry you?

29:15.187 --> 29:20.126
That's why you wanted us
all to be here this weekend?

29:20.159 --> 29:21.560
Okay, I'll do my best.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.495
I won't even talk to
Susie this weekend.

29:23.529 --> 29:24.396
- I would appreciate it.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.232
Just keep it in your
pants for 48 hours.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.534
- Listen, you have to
talk to him this weekend.

29:28.567 --> 29:32.204
You have to leave him with no
hope of this going anywhere.

29:32.238 --> 29:34.506
- I know.
- Tonight!

29:34.540 --> 29:36.876
It's not fair to Peter
or Nancy if he thinks

29:36.909 --> 29:39.045
there's some future
with you two.

29:39.078 --> 29:40.412
- You're right.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.181
I'll tell him tonight.

29:42.214 --> 29:45.051
- I'll avoid her like the plague,
I promise, for you, buddy.

29:45.084 --> 29:45.918
- Thank you.

29:47.586 --> 29:49.421
- Peter, we need to talk.

29:49.455 --> 29:50.957
- I tried my best.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.426
- Hey, guys, look
at who I found.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.462
- Hey, everybody, am I late?

29:56.495 --> 29:57.496
- Holy shit!

29:58.464 --> 29:59.832
What is she doing here?

29:59.866 --> 30:00.867
- What am I doing here?

30:00.900 --> 30:02.034
What are you doing here?

30:02.068 --> 30:04.570
Mary said you weren't coming
to the cabin this weekend.

30:04.603 --> 30:05.671
- Well, Dave told me
you weren't coming.

30:05.704 --> 30:07.840
If I thought you'd be here,
I would never have come.

30:07.874 --> 30:09.942
- Now, everybody,
just calm down.

30:09.976 --> 30:13.880
Mary and I thought that it
would be best for you guys

30:13.913 --> 30:16.015
to come here and
talk things out.

30:16.048 --> 30:17.850
- Ha, talk it out?

30:17.884 --> 30:19.919
Not exactly Peter's strong suit.

30:19.952 --> 30:20.619
- Oh, I talked, I talked.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.021
I thought we were doing better.

30:22.054 --> 30:23.289
I thought we were
making progress.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.424
I even went to see that
stupid doctor of yours.

30:25.457 --> 30:27.960
- Dr. Gordon is not stupid.

30:27.994 --> 30:30.429
- Dr. Gordon's a moron.

30:30.462 --> 30:32.932
- You think I'm a moron.

30:32.965 --> 30:35.467
I, I never said that.

30:35.501 --> 30:37.236
- You just said it.

30:37.269 --> 30:39.872
- Oh, well, um, anyway.

30:39.906 --> 30:41.173
- Guys--

30:41.207 --> 30:43.976
- Mary, how would you
think this would work?

30:44.010 --> 30:47.046
I can understand and idiot move
like this coming from Dave.

30:47.079 --> 30:48.380
- Hey!

30:48.414 --> 30:51.417
- An idiotic, but
well-intentioned, move, better?

30:51.450 --> 30:52.885
- Little bit.

30:52.919 --> 30:55.955
- Mary, I told you things
about me and Peter.

30:55.988 --> 30:57.523
You must have known
this wouldn't work.

30:57.556 --> 31:00.559
- I'm beginning to see that.

31:00.592 --> 31:02.995
You two are our best friends.

31:03.029 --> 31:06.232
- Hey!
- Two, of our best friends.

31:06.265 --> 31:07.967
You loved each other so much.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.969
We just wanted to help.

31:10.002 --> 31:11.403
We thought if we
just got you both

31:11.437 --> 31:15.207
in the same room together,
maybe, I don't know.

31:17.176 --> 31:19.078
- Well, Peter,
- Nancy.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.414
- Do you want to go or should I?

31:22.448 --> 31:24.283
- I'll go, you stay.

31:24.316 --> 31:26.185
- No, you got here
first, I'll go.

31:26.218 --> 31:27.119
- Well, if you insist.

31:27.153 --> 31:28.487
Take the roads carefully.

31:28.520 --> 31:30.189
It gets a little
dangerous at night, okay?

31:30.222 --> 31:31.357
- Peter!
- What?

31:31.390 --> 31:32.959
She wants to go.

31:32.992 --> 31:34.460
- Nobody's going anywhere.

31:34.493 --> 31:37.997
The last ferry's gone
with the wind, 1939.

31:39.531 --> 31:41.500
- Um, I can, uh,
swim across the lake

31:41.533 --> 31:43.002
and then once I
get to the highway,

31:43.035 --> 31:44.136
I can hitchhike to
a hotel, I guess.

31:44.170 --> 31:46.072
- Look, we were
married for years.

31:46.105 --> 31:48.340
I think we can spend one weekend
together in the same house

31:48.374 --> 31:49.976
without killing each other.

31:50.009 --> 31:51.443
- Can we?
- Great.

31:52.511 --> 31:53.579
Who's hungry?

32:12.531 --> 32:15.267
- This dinner is
excellent, Mary.

32:16.702 --> 32:20.339
I haven't had a home-cooked
meal in I don't know how long.

32:22.708 --> 32:24.243
- What's that supposed to mean?

32:24.276 --> 32:26.979
- Nothing, I'm just
complimenting Mary's cooking.

32:27.013 --> 32:30.349
It's been a while since
anyone cooked for me.

32:30.382 --> 32:32.018
The fact that I was
kicked out of my house

32:32.051 --> 32:34.120
and had to live in a hotel
for a month, I'm sure,

32:34.153 --> 32:35.621
has nothing to do with it.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.723
- I suppose that's my fault?

32:37.756 --> 32:41.994
- Well, I didn't kick
myself out of the house.

32:49.735 --> 32:52.304
- George, Susie was saying
that you guys are thinking

32:52.338 --> 32:54.273
about going to Bermuda.

32:55.174 --> 32:56.475
- We're thinking about it,

32:56.508 --> 32:58.610
thinking hard.

32:58.644 --> 33:00.412
Well, that's great.

33:00.446 --> 33:02.181
And, the chicken is really good.

33:02.214 --> 33:03.349
It's really good.

33:03.382 --> 33:04.616
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

33:04.650 --> 33:05.484
- Eh.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.323
- It's nice to get away.

33:11.357 --> 33:13.359
- It is.
- Yep.

33:13.392 --> 33:15.427
- God, you know, I think the
last time I went on vacation

33:15.461 --> 33:17.629
was my honeymoon.

33:17.663 --> 33:20.299
- I took you on other vacations.

33:20.332 --> 33:25.171
- Yes, our summer getaway
to Hoboken was so nice.

33:25.204 --> 33:28.207
- You seemed to
like it at the time.

33:33.579 --> 33:38.117
I'm sorry,
it's just funny, I mean,

33:38.150 --> 33:40.719
six friends,
stranded in a cabin.

33:42.188 --> 33:44.256
I mean, if this
was a horror movie,

33:44.290 --> 33:48.760
we'd all be dead by
morning.

34:01.173 --> 34:03.109
- All right, that's it.

34:03.142 --> 34:07.113
When are you two gonna
get back together?

34:07.146 --> 34:09.114
Everyone's thinking it.

34:09.148 --> 34:11.817
- Susie, that's
wildly inappropriate.

34:11.850 --> 34:13.385
- You know, I'm
gonna go lie down.

34:13.418 --> 34:15.187
It was a long car ride.

34:15.221 --> 34:16.155
- Yeah.
- Sure.

34:16.188 --> 34:18.190
I'll show you your room.

34:21.293 --> 34:24.096
I'm sorry about all that.

34:24.130 --> 34:25.496
We really did want to help.

34:25.531 --> 34:27.166
- I know, I know.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.172
What was that?

34:34.206 --> 34:36.175
- Oh my God, it was so awkward.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.643
That was
the worst dinner ever.

34:37.676 --> 34:39.277
- Oh!

34:39.311 --> 34:40.212
- So.
- So?

34:41.679 --> 34:43.649
- It's important you know how
uncomfortable that was for me.

34:43.681 --> 34:46.485
- Mm-mm, it was pretty
uncomfortable for everybody.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.219
- I have to know,

34:48.254 --> 34:49.521
what exactly did you think
was gonna happen, tonight?

34:49.554 --> 34:52.224
Was I supposed to see
Nancy and she would see me

34:52.257 --> 34:53.859
and then, suddenly, we'd
be all over each other?

34:53.891 --> 34:55.594
No.

34:55.627 --> 34:58.297
You were supposed to see
her and then talk to her

34:58.330 --> 35:01.133
and then you'd be
all over each other.

35:01.167 --> 35:03.235
- Nancy doesn't love me anymore.

35:03.269 --> 35:04.870
She said, I'm not
the man she married,

35:04.903 --> 35:06.272
whatever the hell that means,

35:06.305 --> 35:08.374
and one weekend was
never gonna change that

35:08.407 --> 35:10.209
and you should have known that,

35:10.242 --> 35:12.311
especially with what I
told you this morning.

35:12.344 --> 35:13.812
- Like, I'm supposed
to cook for him?

35:13.845 --> 35:15.647
- Gimme my chicken.

35:15.681 --> 35:18.217
Iron my socks.

35:18.250 --> 35:19.451
He doesn't talk
like that at all.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.488
- That's gonna win me over.

35:22.521 --> 35:23.922
- I don't know what that was.

35:23.955 --> 35:27.293
Uh, whew, I mean,
we wanted to try.

35:28.494 --> 35:30.862
If it weren't for you guys
we wouldn't be together, so--

35:30.896 --> 35:33.265
- I know, I appreciate it.

35:33.299 --> 35:36.735
- I think, I think
Dave's cheating on me.

35:37.936 --> 35:38.804
- What?

35:38.837 --> 35:40.806
- No, it's nothing,
I'm, I'm being crazy.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.908
- Why do you think
he's cheating on you?

35:42.941 --> 35:46.612
- I don't know, he's been
really distant and secretive.

35:46.645 --> 35:49.448
He was on the phone and
he was talking about me

35:49.481 --> 35:51.650
and, uh, he lied about it.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.587
And then, he wouldn't
let me open his bag.

35:55.621 --> 35:57.423
- I don't know, I
mean, that's weird.

35:57.456 --> 36:01.227
It's weird, but I don't think
that means he's cheating.

36:01.260 --> 36:03.962
- Yeah, I know, I'm being crazy.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.964
- Dave would never cheat on you.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.433
Dave loves you.

36:08.900 --> 36:13.472
- Well, he might love me a
little more after tonight

36:13.505 --> 36:16.575
'cause I'm planning
to seduce him.

36:19.578 --> 36:21.580
Okay, I'll let you rest.

36:22.581 --> 36:24.983
I gotta go get ready.
- Oh, wow.

36:25.016 --> 36:28.186
Damn.

36:44.370 --> 36:45.837
- Oh my God, George.

36:49.007 --> 36:51.343
Yes!
- Yes, to what?

36:51.377 --> 36:54.513
- Yes, to whatever you want
to ask me this weekend.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.014
- Whatever?
- Mm-hmm.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.683
Oh, how about that?

36:57.716 --> 37:00.652
How about this, yeah?

37:02.888 --> 37:05.791
- Is there anything you
wanna ask me, right now?

37:05.824 --> 37:07.893
- Mm, I can't think
of anything right now,

37:07.926 --> 37:11.029
but later on, when
we're, I have an idea,

37:11.062 --> 37:12.431
so you can say yes to that.

37:13.465 --> 37:15.401
Just keep an open mind.

37:15.434 --> 37:16.502
- All right.
- Okay.

37:16.535 --> 37:18.370
- Later, then.
- Later.

37:18.404 --> 37:20.572
I don't know what's gotten
into you, but I like it.

37:20.606 --> 37:22.441
- George,
- Dolphin?

37:22.474 --> 37:24.310
- I think that you should help

37:24.343 --> 37:26.878
Nancy and Peter
get back together.

37:26.912 --> 37:28.847
Help them find that
spark that we have,

37:28.880 --> 37:31.049
that they don't
have, that we have.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.051
- Right.
- Right.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.520
- How do I do it?

37:34.553 --> 37:37.356
Do whatever it takes.

37:37.389 --> 37:39.325
Oh, anything goes?

37:39.358 --> 37:40.392
- Anything goes.

37:42.328 --> 37:43.395
- Could you hit me again?

37:43.429 --> 37:44.363
- No, that's weird.

37:44.396 --> 37:47.966
And it's,

37:49.468 --> 37:50.736
not that weird.

37:54.473 --> 37:55.474
- Oh, sorry.

37:57.008 --> 37:59.878
I didn't mean to interrupt you.

37:59.911 --> 38:02.581
Look, dinner was pretty awful.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.082
- It wasn't that bad.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.352
- It was pretty bad.

38:06.385 --> 38:07.653
- Okay, it was bad.

38:07.686 --> 38:09.388
- I don't want
things to be weird

38:09.421 --> 38:11.757
with us this whole weekend, I
mean, we're stuck here, right?

38:11.790 --> 38:16.094
So, we could at least try
to be civil with each other.

38:16.127 --> 38:17.596
- I couldn't agree more.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.965
- Good, can you believe
Dave and Mary thought

38:19.998 --> 38:21.367
this was a good idea?

38:21.400 --> 38:22.734
- They were just trying to help;

38:22.768 --> 38:25.437
plus, maybe it
couldn't hurt to talk.

38:25.471 --> 38:26.304
- Maybe.

38:30.376 --> 38:30.976
Hello?

38:31.009 --> 38:32.678
- Hey, it's just me.

38:32.711 --> 38:34.446
Why are you in the closet?

38:34.480 --> 38:36.382
I'll be out in a minute, Honey.

38:36.415 --> 38:37.983
I've got a surprise for you.

38:38.016 --> 38:40.386
- Oh, I love surprises.

38:52.698 --> 38:55.133
Honey, I gotta go outside, now.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.402
I will be back.

38:59.605 --> 39:01.373
Peter, I need your help!
- What?

39:01.407 --> 39:03.942
- I lost the ring.
- Whoa!

39:03.975 --> 39:06.612
- You can't tell Mary.
- Mary!

39:07.913 --> 39:08.547
- Peter!

39:09.648 --> 39:11.016
Peter, what are you doing here?

39:11.049 --> 39:13.118
- I'm, I'm helping?

39:13.151 --> 39:14.753
- Dave, get him out of here.

39:14.786 --> 39:16.388
- Uh, breasts, nice
to see you, Mary.

39:16.422 --> 39:17.623
You look great!

39:17.656 --> 39:18.890
Ow, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa,

39:18.924 --> 39:19.825
whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

39:19.858 --> 39:20.626
- What is wrong with you?

39:20.659 --> 39:21.427
- What's wrong with me?

39:21.460 --> 39:22.894
What's wrong with you?

39:22.928 --> 39:23.829
You almost pulled my ear
off and she does look great.

39:23.862 --> 39:24.630
Now, what ring did you lose?

39:24.663 --> 39:26.064
- The engagement ring.

39:26.097 --> 39:27.198
- How do you lose
an engagement ring?

39:27.232 --> 39:29.034
- I don't know; it was in
the top pocket of my luggage

39:29.067 --> 39:30.101
and now it's gone.

39:30.135 --> 39:31.437
I need you to go to the
living room and look for it

39:31.470 --> 39:32.404
and I need to go back in there.

39:32.438 --> 39:33.171
- Okay, okay.
- Go, I need it.

39:33.204 --> 39:34.506
- I'll find it.
- Now, go, go!

39:34.540 --> 39:36.408
You can count on me.

39:43.682 --> 39:45.016
Look, excuse me.

39:47.919 --> 39:49.154
- Are you looking
for something, Peter?

39:49.187 --> 39:53.692
- Um, yes, have you
seen a small shaped box?

39:53.725 --> 39:55.461
- Sit, just sit.

39:55.494 --> 39:57.663
We were on a break!

39:57.696 --> 39:58.530
- Good.

40:00.499 --> 40:01.800
This is nice.

40:01.833 --> 40:02.634
How you doing?

40:02.668 --> 40:04.102
- How long has it been

40:04.135 --> 40:05.437
since we've all been here
together, like a year?

40:05.471 --> 40:07.939
- Yeah, I guess, a year.

40:07.973 --> 40:09.641
- What happened to you two?

40:09.675 --> 40:10.676
Everything was so perfect.

40:10.709 --> 40:12.177
You loved each other.

40:12.210 --> 40:13.344
- George, I appreciate what
you're trying to do, but--

40:13.378 --> 40:17.883
- Shh, Nancy, I know you two
were happy, what happened?

40:17.916 --> 40:19.718
- I was; we were happy.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.487
I was very happy.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.455
And then, I wasn't.

40:23.489 --> 40:24.222
- You never told me why.

40:24.255 --> 40:26.091
Was I just supposed to guess?

40:26.124 --> 40:27.192
- Peter, I...

40:29.695 --> 40:31.730
One day, the spark
was just gone.

40:31.763 --> 40:32.764
- Ooh, ouch.

40:34.232 --> 40:36.568
- You know, Nancy, sometimes
in a long-term relationship,

40:36.602 --> 40:39.705
the spark just
fizzles out.

40:39.738 --> 40:41.473
But, I think I could help.

40:41.507 --> 40:42.841
- How are you gonna
help us with that?

40:42.874 --> 40:44.910
- Peter, ae you familiar
with the menage?

40:44.943 --> 40:46.177
- A threesome?

40:46.211 --> 40:47.713
You want me and Nancy
to have a threesome?

40:49.648 --> 40:51.082
- Just watch, Peter.

40:51.116 --> 40:52.551
I guess
that's why we're all friends.

40:52.584 --> 40:53.852
- No, nope, no it's
not gonna happen.

40:53.885 --> 40:55.153
Nancy, it's not
gonna happen, right?

40:55.186 --> 40:56.121
Nancy!

40:56.154 --> 40:57.989
George, stop kissing Nancy!

40:58.023 --> 41:00.659
Upf, oh!

41:00.692 --> 41:02.260
It's, it's been a while.

41:02.293 --> 41:05.230
Um, I, I gotta go lay down.

41:05.263 --> 41:07.065
Um, headache.

41:09.267 --> 41:11.503
- Well, I tried.

41:11.537 --> 41:12.571
Tell Susie I tried.

41:12.604 --> 41:14.606
- Wait, wait, wait, Susie
asked you to do that?

41:14.640 --> 41:16.675
- Oh, she wanted me to
get you kids talking.

41:16.708 --> 41:17.509
That was my idea.

41:17.543 --> 41:18.777
She said anything goes.

41:18.810 --> 41:20.145
Speaking of Susie, though--

41:20.178 --> 41:21.547
- What about Susie?

41:21.580 --> 41:23.248
- She's been acting
strange lately.

41:23.281 --> 41:25.551
- Strange, how strange?

41:25.584 --> 41:27.519
- I don't know,
she won't tell me.

41:27.553 --> 41:28.587
She's outside, now.

41:28.620 --> 41:30.789
Do you, you think you could
go talk to her for me?

41:30.822 --> 41:32.057
- You want me to go outside

41:32.090 --> 41:34.059
and talk to Susie,
alone, right now?

41:34.092 --> 41:36.194
- It would mean a lot.

41:36.227 --> 41:37.829
- Okay, I'll do it.

41:40.098 --> 41:42.267
- Oh, you are such
a good person.

41:42.300 --> 41:43.535
Oh, thank you.

41:43.569 --> 41:45.270
- Oh, tell Susie I tried, okay?

41:45.303 --> 41:46.772
I will.

41:46.805 --> 41:49.007
- And, um, let me
know what she says

41:49.040 --> 41:51.543
and if you change your
mind about anything,

41:51.577 --> 41:54.112
- Okay.
- I'm right here.

41:54.145 --> 41:55.213
- Okay, okay.

41:57.949 --> 41:59.885
Oh, I am going to hell.

42:01.286 --> 42:03.254
* I'm getting married
at Buon Assista

42:07.693 --> 42:09.260
- Peter, I was
just about to go--

42:09.294 --> 42:12.731
- Susie, Susie, you were the
one who said we needed to talk,

42:12.764 --> 42:13.932
so let's talk.

42:13.965 --> 42:16.702
Just give me two minutes
and that's it, okay?

42:16.735 --> 42:18.570
- Okay, let's talk.

42:18.604 --> 42:20.706
What happened that
night was a mistake.

42:20.739 --> 42:22.173
- Aw, don't say that.

42:22.207 --> 42:24.309
That night was amazing.

42:24.342 --> 42:27.245
- Eh, it, it was nice, but--

42:27.278 --> 42:29.915
- Susie, I love, the
way you have your hair.

42:29.948 --> 42:32.017
Is it raining?

42:33.051 --> 42:34.653
No rain, I'll be.

42:36.988 --> 42:38.890
You guys need
anything, any drinks?

42:38.924 --> 42:40.091
- Nope.
- Good, we're good.

42:40.125 --> 42:41.559
- Good.
- Drinks.

42:45.330 --> 42:46.431
- What was that about?

42:46.464 --> 42:48.366
- George wants me to find
out what's wrong with you.

42:48.399 --> 42:49.300
- Peter!
- I know, I know, I know,

42:49.334 --> 42:50.235
I know, I'm awful human being.

42:50.268 --> 42:52.303
Look, if you can tell
me that things with,

42:52.337 --> 42:54.239
between you and George
are better, now,

42:54.272 --> 42:56.742
than they were that night,
then I'll leave you alone.

42:56.775 --> 42:59.711
I'll never bother
you again, I promise.

42:59.745 --> 43:01.680
- I love George.

43:01.713 --> 43:03.615
I know that's not what you
want to hear, right now,

43:03.649 --> 43:04.750
but it's true.

43:04.783 --> 43:05.951
- But, can George give you--

43:05.984 --> 43:06.952
puppy dogs?

43:08.386 --> 43:10.889
- I know liars when I see liars.

43:10.922 --> 43:12.624
You two are thirsty.

43:16.294 --> 43:17.729
Puppy dogs?

43:17.763 --> 43:20.098
- It's the first thing
that came to my mind.

43:20.131 --> 43:21.399
It's nice to see you laugh.

43:21.432 --> 43:25.370
So, what about us?

43:25.403 --> 43:27.372
- Peter, I like you.

43:27.405 --> 43:31.777
If me and George weren't
together, maybe, probably not,

43:33.945 --> 43:35.146
but things have changed.

43:35.180 --> 43:37.348
I didn't think they
could, but they have.

43:37.382 --> 43:39.617
- So, that's a maybe?
- No.

43:41.720 --> 43:42.353
- Oh,

43:43.722 --> 43:44.990
okay.

43:45.023 --> 43:46.758
- Peter--
- No, no, yeah.

43:46.792 --> 43:48.059
- I, I'm sorry.

43:54.199 --> 43:56.802
No, I'm really not sorry.

43:58.103 --> 43:58.937
- Well?

44:00.271 --> 44:01.707
- I tried my best.

44:11.783 --> 44:15.721
- The heck is wrong with
everyone this weekend?

44:19.457 --> 44:22.060
- Dave, did you find
your toothbrush yet?

44:22.093 --> 44:22.928
- Not yet.

44:23.795 --> 44:24.963
- You can just use mine

44:24.996 --> 44:26.464
and we can get you a
new one in the morning.

44:26.497 --> 44:29.735
- Gross, I like to use my own.

44:29.768 --> 44:31.102
- Dave!
- Yes, dear.

44:31.136 --> 44:32.771
- When your girlfriend,

44:32.804 --> 44:35.440
who is wearing some
very sexy lingerie

44:35.473 --> 44:37.943
that she bought
especially for this trip

44:37.976 --> 44:39.811
is telling you to come to bed,

44:39.845 --> 44:43.815
the correct response
is, "Right away."

44:44.482 --> 44:46.417
So, I'll ask you again,

44:48.253 --> 44:49.420
are you coming to bed?

44:49.454 --> 44:50.488
- Right away!

44:56.494 --> 44:58.830
- What are you doing?
- Foreplay?

44:58.864 --> 45:02.000
- Ooh, you're so
distracted tonight.

45:02.033 --> 45:03.401
I guess I'll have
to do something

45:03.434 --> 45:07.205
to get your mind off
whatever's distracting you.

45:24.222 --> 45:26.524
- I can't stop
thinking about you.

45:26.557 --> 45:28.326
I tried, but I can't.

45:29.795 --> 45:31.362
I've been in love
with you for years

45:31.396 --> 45:35.100
and if you feel the same way
about me that I feel about you,

45:35.133 --> 45:37.969
meet me in the patio
after everyone's asleep,

45:38.003 --> 45:39.938
at one o'clock.

45:39.971 --> 45:41.773
Love always, Peter.

46:16.607 --> 46:19.777
- Well, I guess
that's a hard no.

46:21.379 --> 46:22.814
- Peter?
- Susie?

46:24.015 --> 46:25.516
Nancy.
- Oh my God,

46:26.985 --> 46:28.586
did you do all this for me?

46:28.619 --> 46:31.857
- Of course I did, uh, who
else would I do it for?

46:31.890 --> 46:32.490
Have a seat.

46:35.160 --> 46:37.395
- Chocolate covered
strawberries?

46:37.428 --> 46:38.997
I didn't think you remembered.

46:39.030 --> 46:40.966
- Of course, I remembered.

46:40.999 --> 46:44.936
What I'm really wondering
is if you remembered.

46:44.970 --> 46:48.539
- I don't think I've had
these since our honeymoon.

46:48.573 --> 46:52.010
- Our honeymoon, how
could I forget that?

46:53.111 --> 46:54.545
- This is so unlike you.

46:54.579 --> 46:57.615
It's so romantic
and spontaneous.

46:57.648 --> 46:58.917
- I'm romantic.

46:58.950 --> 47:00.886
- No, you're not.

47:00.919 --> 47:03.088
That was part of the problem.

47:03.121 --> 47:05.891
- Well, better late than never.

47:07.658 --> 47:09.861
- Wait, what were you
doing, just sitting here?

47:09.895 --> 47:11.362
What were you waiting for?

47:11.396 --> 47:15.533
- Um, I was waiting, I was
waiting for the courage,

47:16.935 --> 47:18.169
the courage to come get you.

47:18.203 --> 47:19.470
I didn't, I didn't know

47:19.504 --> 47:23.541
if you'd like all
this, or me, anymore.

47:23.574 --> 47:27.245
- Peter, of course
I still like you.

47:27.278 --> 47:29.915
I just feel like
we've been strangers

47:29.948 --> 47:32.617
living in the same house
for years, you know?

47:32.650 --> 47:34.219
- Of course, I know.

47:34.252 --> 47:35.921
How do you think I felt?

47:35.954 --> 47:39.124
- I had no idea
you felt that way.

47:39.157 --> 47:43.028
- It'd be a shame to let
this wine go to waste.

47:43.061 --> 47:45.463
Would you like a glass?

47:45.496 --> 47:46.932
- Sure, why not?

47:46.965 --> 47:49.534
Just one, though.
- Oh, just one.

48:02.013 --> 48:04.015
To unexpected surprises.

48:04.049 --> 48:06.017
- To unexpected surprises.

48:12.023 --> 48:13.358
- Hey, Dolphin.

48:13.391 --> 48:14.960
Well?

48:14.993 --> 48:15.693
- Well?

48:15.726 --> 48:16.527
- Well, we're alone, now.

48:16.561 --> 48:18.696
Don't you have
something to ask me?

48:18.729 --> 48:19.998
- Oh, really?

48:21.199 --> 48:22.667
Okay,
- Okay.

48:22.700 --> 48:26.704
- I will, oh, will you,
Susie the Dolphin Smith--

48:26.737 --> 48:28.273
- Yes, yes, yes!

48:28.306 --> 48:29.540
Hey, hey, hey!

48:29.574 --> 48:30.541
I didn't even ask
you the question.

48:30.575 --> 48:32.710
Okay.

48:32.743 --> 48:36.147
- Will you, Susie
Smith, love of my life,

48:37.682 --> 48:39.284
get it on, with me?

48:40.718 --> 48:41.953
- What?

48:42.988 --> 48:43.921
Oh, I know.

48:45.056 --> 48:46.524
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

48:46.557 --> 48:48.159
- If you know,
could you tell me?

48:48.193 --> 48:49.627
- Did you lose something?

48:49.660 --> 48:53.164
- No, the anal beads
are in the bag, babe.

48:56.601 --> 48:58.536
This is a ring.

48:58.569 --> 49:00.071
- I know.

49:00.105 --> 49:01.506
I found it in your bag.

49:01.539 --> 49:02.740
I couldn't help myself.

49:02.773 --> 49:06.144
I'm sorry, George, but
yes, I'll marry you.

49:06.177 --> 49:08.013
Of course, I will marry you.

49:10.448 --> 49:13.051
- That's not my ring.
- What?

49:14.252 --> 49:16.087
- This is not my ring.

49:17.122 --> 49:19.057
- It was in your bag.

49:23.794 --> 49:26.264
- That's not my bag.

49:26.297 --> 49:28.133
That must be Peter
or Dave's bag,

49:28.166 --> 49:31.036
which is actually hilarious

49:31.069 --> 49:34.672
because they're gonna be
in for a huge surprise

49:34.705 --> 49:39.477
when they find all that weird
crap in there.

49:39.510 --> 49:40.545
- Oh my God.

49:40.578 --> 49:43.081
- Oh my God is right,
you could say that again.

49:43.114 --> 49:44.015
Give me a hug.

49:44.049 --> 49:45.616
- You sick fuck.

49:45.650 --> 49:48.986
You are never gonna
ask me to marry you.

49:51.489 --> 49:53.124
- You know I don't
believe in marriage, babe.

49:53.158 --> 49:54.725
We talked about this.

49:54.759 --> 49:55.560
You don't?

49:55.593 --> 49:56.394
- I don't!

49:57.328 --> 49:58.396
I really don't.

49:58.429 --> 50:01.599
We talked, I talked, you yelled.

50:01.632 --> 50:04.502
And, then, we got
into another fight.

50:04.535 --> 50:07.105
I mean, think about
Peter and Nancy, right.

50:07.138 --> 50:08.806
They were really, really happy

50:08.839 --> 50:13.010
and then this thing gets involved and now they're miserable.

50:14.645 --> 50:16.081
- They're separated.

50:16.114 --> 50:18.149
- Right, and I don't
want us to get separated

50:18.183 --> 50:20.818
because we love each other,
so.

50:20.851 --> 50:23.688
- I think I'm gonna stay in
one of the empty rooms tonight.

50:23.721 --> 50:26.291
- How about hugs instead?
- No.

50:28.159 --> 50:29.460
You're disgusting.

50:30.828 --> 50:33.331
You're disgusting.

50:35.833 --> 50:38.269
Peter?

50:38.303 --> 50:42.140
I know I'm late, but, I
hope I'm not too late.

50:50.515 --> 50:51.782
- There she is.

50:51.816 --> 50:54.485
I haven't seen you laugh
in a very long time.

50:54.519 --> 50:59.190
- Well, you haven't said anything funny in a very long time.

50:59.224 --> 51:00.258
I don't know if it's
the wine talking,

51:00.291 --> 51:02.860
but you are looking very sexy.

51:02.893 --> 51:04.795
- It's the wine.

51:05.896 --> 51:08.099
Trust me, it's the wine.

51:09.700 --> 51:12.737
Do you remember the first
time we came up here,

51:12.770 --> 51:15.106
- Yes.
- We were walking by the lake

51:15.140 --> 51:15.973
and George--

51:16.006 --> 51:18.343
- George wanted to
go skinny-dipping.

51:19.644 --> 51:23.181
- He always wanted
to go skinny-dipping.

51:23.914 --> 51:26.851
- You know, we had some
good times up here.

51:26.884 --> 51:28.353
- Yeah, we did.

51:33.724 --> 51:36.127
- I don't think I've been
up this late in years.

51:36.161 --> 51:39.830
- Ah, as I recall, most
of those nights were

51:41.232 --> 51:43.768
also with me and
a bottle of wine

51:45.203 --> 51:48.306
and I also recall how most
of those nights ended.

51:48.339 --> 51:51.709
- Peter, are you asking
me to spend the night?

51:51.742 --> 51:53.311
I think I am.

51:53.344 --> 51:55.280
- What kind of girl
do you think I am?

51:55.313 --> 51:56.514
I'm hoping the kind

51:56.547 --> 51:58.916
that sleeps with a
guy on the first date.

51:58.949 --> 52:02.119
- Is that what this
is, our first date?

52:03.188 --> 52:05.590
- I'm hoping the first of many.

52:24.975 --> 52:26.577
Where are you going?

52:26.611 --> 52:29.180
- I'm, I'm just
gonna go get a drink.

52:29.214 --> 52:30.281
I'll be back.

52:31.582 --> 52:33.318
- But, I'm so sleepy.

53:05.250 --> 53:06.984
- Shh, shh.
- Shh.

53:10.688 --> 53:11.989
- Okay, okay, I will go slip

53:12.022 --> 53:13.424
into something more comfortable.

53:13.458 --> 53:15.826
You go warm up the
sheets for me, okay?

53:15.860 --> 53:17.362
- Yes, ma'am.

53:21.332 --> 53:22.233
Whoa!

53:22.267 --> 53:23.468
- Peter, we need to talk.

53:23.501 --> 53:24.969
- Oh, yes, yes, you're right.

53:25.002 --> 53:28.806
Um, look, I'm sorry I saw you
in your lingerie and stared,

53:28.839 --> 53:29.974
but, to be fair,
you're very attractive

53:30.007 --> 53:31.141
and I'm just--
- What?

53:31.175 --> 53:33.344
No, this has nothing to do
with you; this is about Dave.

53:33.378 --> 53:33.978
Are you drunk?

53:34.011 --> 53:34.812
- What? Yes, a little.

53:34.845 --> 53:36.647
Dave, what about Dave?

53:36.681 --> 53:37.848
- He's been acting
weird all night

53:37.882 --> 53:39.850
and there were some things in
his bag that were disturbing.

53:39.884 --> 53:41.252
- You found the case?

53:41.286 --> 53:41.986
- What case?

53:42.019 --> 53:43.588
- Nevermind.
- Fine.

53:43.621 --> 53:44.822
I think he's hiding
something from me.

53:44.855 --> 53:47.458
He went to get a drink
and he hasn't come back.

53:47.492 --> 53:49.327
You're his best friend,
do you know what happened?

53:49.360 --> 53:50.227
- What?

53:50.261 --> 53:51.962
Yes, no, um, uh, no,
I'm sure he's fine.

53:51.996 --> 53:53.831
Uh, look, why don't you
just go back into your room

53:53.864 --> 53:55.032
and wait for him.

53:55.065 --> 53:56.601
I'm sure he'll be
back in a few minutes.

53:56.634 --> 53:57.702
- Okay, yeah.

53:58.736 --> 54:01.339
Yeah.

54:06.644 --> 54:10.315
Shit!

54:16.887 --> 54:19.990
- Mare Elizabeth McConnell,
just go back to bed.

54:20.024 --> 54:22.327
He'll be back any minute.

54:24.662 --> 54:25.496
Shit!

54:29.434 --> 54:32.337
Dave?

54:32.370 --> 54:33.838
Dave, where are you?

54:38.409 --> 54:40.978
If you're cheating on
me, I swear to God...

54:54.592 --> 54:58.363
- Peter.
- Susie.

54:58.396 --> 54:59.564
What are you doing here?

54:59.597 --> 55:01.432
- I changed my mind.

55:01.466 --> 55:02.667
I read your letter.

55:02.700 --> 55:04.502
It was beautiful.

55:04.535 --> 55:07.538
You were right, George is never
gonna give me what I want.

55:07.572 --> 55:09.073
Well, what about you?

55:09.106 --> 55:12.377
- Oh, this is
spectacularly bad timing.

55:24.522 --> 55:25.990
- Why are you running from me?

55:26.023 --> 55:27.057
- I'm not running.

55:27.091 --> 55:29.093
Oh, I get it,
you're playing hard to get.

55:29.126 --> 55:31.095
- No, no, no, no, no,
you said you loved George

55:31.128 --> 55:33.598
and that this could never
happen again, right?

55:33.631 --> 55:35.433
- Oh, George and I have been
together for four years.

55:35.466 --> 55:37.835
He's never gonna
ask me to marry him.

55:37.868 --> 55:39.437
Let's forget about George.

55:42.440 --> 55:43.040
Who's George?

55:44.742 --> 55:46.411
- Peter, you didn't?

55:47.978 --> 55:50.515
- Well, I, the thing is,

55:50.548 --> 55:51.716
I was, I just,

55:53.418 --> 55:54.051
yeah.

55:55.420 --> 55:56.854
Yes, I did.

55:56.887 --> 55:58.589
Okay.

55:58.623 --> 56:00.157
- I know what you're thinking,

56:00.190 --> 56:03.461
but I'm not the bad guy here.

56:03.494 --> 56:04.962
- Okay.

56:04.995 --> 56:08.933
- I mean, I didn't mean
to hurt anyone; I didn't.

56:08.966 --> 56:09.800
- Okay.

56:29.186 --> 56:30.521
- Ooh, shit!

56:30.555 --> 56:31.622
Fuck, shit!
- Who's that?

56:31.656 --> 56:33.424
- Um, probably Nancy.

56:33.458 --> 56:34.925
- Nancy, what's she doing here?

56:34.959 --> 56:36.427
- Um, I, I invited her.

56:36.461 --> 56:37.762
You invited her?

56:37.795 --> 56:39.597
Oh, did George tell you
about that threesome thing?

56:39.630 --> 56:40.531
It never happened.

56:40.565 --> 56:41.932
- What, no, no, no, no, no!

56:41.966 --> 56:44.902
I had wine and strawberries
and candles for you.

56:44.935 --> 56:46.003
- Oh that's so sweet.

56:46.036 --> 56:47.438
Peter.
- Yeah.

56:47.472 --> 56:48.573
But then, you know,
you didn't show up

56:48.606 --> 56:50.040
and then Nancy was there.

56:50.074 --> 56:51.609
We had a few drinks and
one thing led to another

56:51.642 --> 56:53.544
and I invited her back here.

56:53.578 --> 56:54.178
You can't be here.

56:54.211 --> 56:55.212
You can't be here.

56:55.245 --> 56:56.046
Nancy can't see you.

56:56.080 --> 56:57.515
- I'm not gonna hide!

56:57.548 --> 56:58.148
- I just need you to
wait in the bathroom

56:58.182 --> 57:00.618
for a couple minutes.

57:00.651 --> 57:03.888
- Fine, get rid of her, fast.
- I will.

57:07.792 --> 57:08.626
- Come in!

57:09.794 --> 57:11.462
George.
- We need to talk, Peter.

57:12.730 --> 57:13.831
George, what are you doing here?

57:13.864 --> 57:14.765
- I read the letter.

57:14.799 --> 57:16.000
- Oh God, you read the letter.

57:16.033 --> 57:16.934
Look, George, I swear
to God I never meant

57:16.967 --> 57:17.902
for you to read that letter.

57:17.935 --> 57:19.203
- Sit.
- Now, George, come on.

57:19.236 --> 57:20.070
- Sit!

57:23.240 --> 57:24.642
- Now, George, you
have to believe me,

57:24.675 --> 57:25.242
I never meant you
to see that letter.

57:25.275 --> 57:26.677
- I'm glad I read it.

57:26.711 --> 57:28.513
- You're, you're
glad you read it?

57:28.546 --> 57:32.517
- Yeah, I mean, honestly,
I thought it was strange,

57:33.918 --> 57:36.921
at first, but then it all
started to make sense.

57:36.954 --> 57:38.222
You know, like?

57:39.657 --> 57:40.958
- I can't believe
you're cool with this?

57:40.991 --> 57:44.695
- Of course, I'm cool
with this, you know?

57:44.729 --> 57:46.764
I mean, we're friends.

57:46.797 --> 57:48.499
- Yeah, I never realized
we were that close.

57:51.168 --> 57:52.202
George!

57:52.236 --> 57:53.037
What are you doing?

57:53.070 --> 57:54.004
You're gay?

57:55.139 --> 57:56.907
- Peter, I hate labels.

57:56.941 --> 57:58.743
Let's just say I'm curious.

57:58.776 --> 58:00.044
After all, you're
the one that said

58:00.077 --> 58:01.712
you're in love
with me for years.

58:01.746 --> 58:02.913
- Oh, no.

58:02.947 --> 58:05.282
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

58:05.315 --> 58:08.085
George, this is a huge mistake.

58:08.118 --> 58:10.655
- The only mistake
would be keeping

58:10.688 --> 58:12.923
your clothes on, Peter.

58:14.191 --> 58:15.225
Peter,
I'm here; open up.

58:15.259 --> 58:16.527
- Nancy!
- What's Nancy doing?

58:16.561 --> 58:17.562
- I invited her.

58:17.595 --> 58:18.763
Uh, you have to hide.

58:18.796 --> 58:20.831
- No more hiding, ever again.

58:20.865 --> 58:23.568
You invite her in, we can
all make love together.

58:23.601 --> 58:25.836
- Um, I don't think
Nancy's ready for that.

58:25.870 --> 58:27.638
I need you to hide.

58:28.606 --> 58:30.608
- Okay, I'll hide
in the bathroom.

58:30.641 --> 58:31.241
- Yes, yes, the bathroom.

58:31.275 --> 58:32.309
Go in the bathroom.

58:32.342 --> 58:34.812
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

58:34.845 --> 58:35.913
You can't go in the bathroom.

58:35.946 --> 58:37.582
Why not?

58:37.615 --> 58:39.984
- Because it's a mess and
you don't like messes.

58:40.017 --> 58:42.920
- Oh.
- Hide under the bed.

58:42.953 --> 58:44.254
Peter, I'm cold.

58:44.288 --> 58:45.690
* Just one moment

58:45.723 --> 58:47.558
- Okay, make it quick.

58:48.726 --> 58:49.794
Or, don't.

58:52.362 --> 58:54.932
- Nancy, you look amazing.

58:54.965 --> 58:56.567
- Aren't you going
to invite me in?

58:56.601 --> 58:59.570
I think I'm coming down
with a cough.

58:59.604 --> 59:01.171
We might want to wait
until it goes away.

59:01.205 --> 59:03.908
- I think I'll take my chances.

59:05.943 --> 59:07.745
- Oh, I am so much trouble.

59:11.115 --> 59:12.750
- Peter.

59:12.783 --> 59:14.852
- George, what are
you doing here?

59:14.885 --> 59:16.120
Where's your shirt?

59:16.153 --> 59:18.222
George, what
are you doing here?

59:18.255 --> 59:20.357
- No more lies, Peter.

59:20.390 --> 59:23.828
Nancy, Peter's in love with
me, has been for years.

59:23.861 --> 59:26.664
Him and I are gonna get
funky on this bed, M-kay.

59:26.697 --> 59:28.899
If you want to join us,
you're more than welcome.

59:28.933 --> 59:31.335
- Um, there really is
a very good explanation

59:31.368 --> 59:32.703
for all of this.

59:34.371 --> 59:35.906
- What's Nancy
doing in your bed?

59:35.940 --> 59:37.642
I thought you were
gonna get rid of her.

59:37.675 --> 59:38.876
George, put your shirt on.

59:38.909 --> 59:40.611
No one wants to see
your lopsided nipples.

59:40.645 --> 59:42.146
- Why am I here?

59:42.179 --> 59:44.649
Why are you in my husband's
bathroom in your underwear?

59:44.682 --> 59:45.883
- I, I can explain this.

59:45.916 --> 59:47.017
There was, um--

59:47.051 --> 59:48.152
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

59:48.185 --> 59:51.388
Peter, after the beautiful
letter that you wrote me,

59:51.421 --> 59:53.323
there shouldn't be
any more secrets.

59:53.357 --> 59:54.959
- The letter was
for me, you moron.

59:54.992 --> 59:56.160
- What letter?

59:57.361 --> 59:58.162
It was for me.

59:58.195 --> 59:59.730
Peter, tell the Dolphin.

01:00:02.399 --> 01:00:05.402
- Oh my God, it was all for her,

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:08.773
all of it, though, the
wine and the strawberries.

01:00:08.806 --> 01:00:10.708
- Nancy, I--
- Oh my God.

01:00:10.741 --> 01:00:12.309
Peter, don't.
- Nancy.

01:00:16.313 --> 01:00:17.882
- There's nothing
wrong with my nipples.

01:00:17.915 --> 01:00:18.983
- You were gonna
sleep with your wife

01:00:19.016 --> 01:00:20.350
while I was in the bathroom?

01:00:20.384 --> 01:00:23.654
- What, uh, yes,
no, I, I don't know.

01:00:24.722 --> 01:00:26.156
I'm pretty drunk, right now.

01:00:26.190 --> 01:00:27.692
- Did you mean
anything you said?

01:00:27.725 --> 01:00:29.326
- Yes, I meant
everything I said.

01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:32.396
That, that night with you
was the happiest I've been

01:00:32.429 --> 01:00:33.798
in a long time.

01:00:33.831 --> 01:00:35.265
- Then, why was
Nancy in your bed?

01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:37.401
- I don't know, she,
she was my wife.

01:00:37.434 --> 01:00:39.704
She is my wife.

01:00:39.737 --> 01:00:41.405
But, then George
came and kissed me

01:00:41.438 --> 01:00:43.407
and it was all very confusing.
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:47.878
So, not only

01:00:47.912 --> 01:00:52.349
do you not love me, but you're
sleeping with my girlfriend.

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:53.450
- I'm gonna kill you.

01:00:56.887 --> 01:00:58.222
Nancy?

01:01:00.725 --> 01:01:01.792
Are you okay?

01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:07.364
- Now, George, don't
do anything stupid.

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:08.532
- Let's think about this.

01:01:08.565 --> 01:01:10.434
You obviously have some very
strong feelings towards me.

01:01:10.467 --> 01:01:12.036
I think we should all just
sit down and talk about it

01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:14.905
and relax a little before
we do anything rash.

01:01:14.939 --> 01:01:16.707
- I don't want to kill you,

01:01:16.741 --> 01:01:18.909
so you should run.
- What?

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:23.380
Run, now.

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:25.816
- George, George,
let's talk about this!

01:01:25.850 --> 01:01:27.351
- Oh, there's nothing
to talk about.

01:01:27.384 --> 01:01:29.019
- I knew it!

01:01:29.053 --> 01:01:30.487
How could you, Dave?
- George, let's talk.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:32.222
- That's my best friend.
- It's not what it looks like!

01:01:32.256 --> 01:01:34.725
What is it you want?

01:01:34.759 --> 01:01:36.727
- What the fuck is going on?
- Oh, I'm so sorry, Dave.

01:01:36.761 --> 01:01:37.728
That was meant for Peter.

01:01:37.762 --> 01:01:39.463
He harpooned my Dolphin.

01:01:39.496 --> 01:01:41.065
- Again?
- Again!

01:01:41.098 --> 01:01:42.800
You knew about this?

01:01:42.833 --> 01:01:43.667
- Oh, don't act so outraged.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.269
You were about to
have sex with Peter.

01:01:45.302 --> 01:01:47.738
- George, you're gay?

01:01:47.772 --> 01:01:49.139
- I'm omni-sexual!

01:01:49.173 --> 01:01:51.275
I don't believe in
terms and labels

01:01:51.308 --> 01:01:54.144
when it comes to love and
lovemaking and I told you that!

01:01:54.178 --> 01:01:55.279
- I thought you were joking!

01:01:55.312 --> 01:01:56.180
- What bullshit!

01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:57.848
- It's not bullshit.

01:01:57.882 --> 01:02:00.284
You can Google it and, another
thing, you're a cheater.

01:02:00.317 --> 01:02:04.454
It was you that went in his
room in your unmentionables.

01:02:04.488 --> 01:02:07.224
- I asked you for one thing
this weekend, for one thing,

01:02:07.257 --> 01:02:08.225
for you to keep it in your pants

01:02:08.258 --> 01:02:09.459
and you couldn't even do that!

01:02:09.493 --> 01:02:10.928
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:02:10.961 --> 01:02:12.129
- So many things.

01:02:12.162 --> 01:02:13.764
- Leave him alone,
you hypocrite!

01:02:13.798 --> 01:02:15.232
- Mary, you don't understand.

01:02:15.265 --> 01:02:16.901
- I understand perfectly.

01:02:16.934 --> 01:02:19.203
You were sleeping with Nancy!

01:02:19.236 --> 01:02:20.771
- You were sleeping
with my wife?

01:02:20.805 --> 01:02:22.006
- Oh fuck!

01:02:22.039 --> 01:02:24.208
- Can I ask which one
of you geniuses brought

01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:25.810
the engagement ring?

01:02:25.843 --> 01:02:26.877
- You found the ring!

01:02:26.911 --> 01:02:28.278
- Oh, it was yours?

01:02:28.312 --> 01:02:31.048
- Oh, Peter, you were
gonna ask me to marry you?

01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:32.482
- You were gonna ask
her to marry you?

01:02:32.516 --> 01:02:33.350
- Nope, not my ring.

01:02:33.383 --> 01:02:35.485
- Great, so no one
wants to marry me.

01:02:35.519 --> 01:02:36.787
- Whose ring is it, Loverboy?

01:02:36.821 --> 01:02:38.122
- I can't say.
- You can't say?

01:02:38.155 --> 01:02:39.824
Kiss me, right now.

01:02:39.857 --> 01:02:41.926
- I don't care about the fricking ring;
I just want to know

01:02:41.959 --> 01:02:45.195
why you were sleeping
with my best friend!

01:02:45.229 --> 01:02:46.563
Nancy, how could you?

01:02:48.866 --> 01:02:50.567
- What do you mean who was it?
- What are you talking about?

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:55.005
Will everyone shut up?

01:02:55.039 --> 01:02:57.808
- George, let go of Peter.

01:02:57.842 --> 01:02:59.309
You're not gonna kill him.

01:02:59.343 --> 01:03:01.846
You really, really should,
but you're not gonna,

01:03:01.879 --> 01:03:03.413
so let him go.

01:03:03.447 --> 01:03:06.250
And, Mary,

01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:08.953
I would never cheat on you.

01:03:08.986 --> 01:03:10.787
I love you so much.

01:03:12.256 --> 01:03:13.858
The ring is mine.

01:03:14.859 --> 01:03:16.493
I brought you here this weekend

01:03:16.526 --> 01:03:18.595
because I wanted to
ask you to be my wife.

01:03:19.563 --> 01:03:20.564
- Oh my God.

01:03:21.866 --> 01:03:23.333
Dave, I had no idea.

01:03:24.969 --> 01:03:26.003
I saw you with Nancy

01:03:26.036 --> 01:03:30.975
and then there were
mysterious phone conversations

01:03:31.008 --> 01:03:33.310
and sex toys in the luggage.

01:03:33.343 --> 01:03:34.144
- Sex toys?

01:03:36.613 --> 01:03:38.115
It doesn't matter.

01:03:40.517 --> 01:03:42.586
Mary Elizabeth McConnell,

01:03:44.554 --> 01:03:48.926
I have loved you from the very
first moment that I met you.

01:03:49.894 --> 01:03:51.295
Will you marry me?

01:03:51.328 --> 01:03:52.229
- Yes!

01:03:52.262 --> 01:03:54.965
Yes, of course, I'll marry you.

01:04:04.408 --> 01:04:06.843
- Let's get you cleaned up.

01:04:10.647 --> 01:04:12.249
- Nancy, I never meant--

01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:15.219
- You can go to hell.

01:04:16.086 --> 01:04:17.254
- Fair enough.

01:04:24.161 --> 01:04:26.630
Well, that could
have all gone better.

01:04:26.663 --> 01:04:29.399
- I don't even know what to say.

01:04:29.433 --> 01:04:30.600
I have to go.

01:04:30.634 --> 01:04:34.004
- Susie, I just want to let
you know that I don't blame you

01:04:34.038 --> 01:04:36.240
for anything that
happened this weekend

01:04:36.273 --> 01:04:39.343
and, more importantly,
I forgive you.

01:04:42.079 --> 01:04:44.915
- No, you don't forgive me.

01:04:44.949 --> 01:04:47.651
George, you just tried
to sleep with Peter.

01:04:47.684 --> 01:04:48.618
Mm-hmm.

01:04:48.652 --> 01:04:52.122
- I'm sorry, I can't
talk to you right now.

01:04:53.557 --> 01:04:56.160
- George, I just want to say
I'm, I'm flattered that--

01:04:56.193 --> 01:04:58.328
- Don't speak, I know
just what you're saying,

01:04:58.362 --> 01:05:00.197
so please stop explaining.

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:05.002
Don't tell me 'cause it
hurts, No Doubt.

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:20.951
* Tired of the seas

01:05:20.985 --> 01:05:24.054
* Boat comes ashore

01:05:24.088 --> 01:05:26.590
* Needing a breather

01:05:26.623 --> 01:05:29.193
* He comes up for more

01:05:29.226 --> 01:05:33.097
* Than he ever could before

01:05:35.032 --> 01:05:37.634
* She was gone

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:46.143
* Do ooh ooh ooh ooh

01:05:49.579 --> 01:05:51.615
* Into the streets

01:05:51.648 --> 01:05:55.519
* He twiddles his hands

01:05:55.552 --> 01:05:58.722
* Since then uneasy

01:05:58.755 --> 01:06:00.724
* Tries to make friends

01:06:00.757 --> 01:06:05.095
* But it ain't
like it used to be

01:06:06.696 --> 01:06:10.600
* Not before he set out to see

01:06:14.404 --> 01:06:17.574
* What have we become

01:06:19.243 --> 01:06:22.179
* Since she's gone

01:06:27.217 --> 01:06:30.087
* Do do do do

01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:33.557
* Ooh do woo hoo hoo

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:36.526
* Walks to the hillside

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:39.129
* Gear on his back

01:06:39.163 --> 01:06:43.433
- Trying to sneak out
before anybody wakes up?

01:06:43.467 --> 01:06:45.702
- I thought it was for
the best, considering.

01:06:45.735 --> 01:06:46.803
- Considering what?

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:48.772
- You know, everyone hating me.

01:06:48.805 --> 01:06:50.807
- Everybody doesn't hate you.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.542
I don't hate you.

01:06:52.576 --> 01:06:53.677
- How's Mary?

01:06:54.578 --> 01:06:56.313
- She doesn't hate you, either,

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:57.481
well, much.

01:06:57.514 --> 01:06:58.815
- Well, that's something.

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:01.385
Oh, Geez, I'm sorry
I punched you.

01:07:01.418 --> 01:07:03.053
- It's okay.

01:07:03.087 --> 01:07:05.322
If I thought you slept with
Mary, I would do the same thing.

01:07:05.355 --> 01:07:07.457
- I would never
sleep with Peter.

01:07:07.491 --> 01:07:10.094
- Oh, not your weekend, there.

01:07:10.127 --> 01:07:11.328
Kisses.

01:07:11.361 --> 01:07:12.729
- No, it is not.

01:07:12.762 --> 01:07:15.432
Thank you, Mary,
that means a lot.

01:07:15.465 --> 01:07:16.800
Still, I'm sorry for everything.

01:07:16.833 --> 01:07:18.502
Congratulations, by the way.

01:07:18.535 --> 01:07:20.637
You two make a lovely couple.

01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:22.839
I'm looking forward
to the wedding.

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:24.040
I have a feeling I
won't be that popular

01:07:24.074 --> 01:07:26.843
with the wedding party, so I
hope you can find me a seat.

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:29.113
- Oh, you're not going
near the wedding party.

01:07:29.879 --> 01:07:31.181
We'll put you in the kitchen.

01:07:31.215 --> 01:07:32.249
- As I deserve.

01:07:35.152 --> 01:07:38.655
Tell George and Susie
I'm sorry for everything.

01:07:38.688 --> 01:07:43.160
I really screwed everything
up, didn't I, and Nancy?

01:07:43.193 --> 01:07:45.495
- You should probably
talk to them yourself.

01:07:45.529 --> 01:07:46.696
- Maybe, yeah.

01:07:51.768 --> 01:07:53.270
- Oh, dammit!

01:07:57.474 --> 01:07:58.808
- Car trouble?

01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:02.446
- The car won't start
and the earliest

01:08:02.479 --> 01:08:04.848
the tow company can
come is on Monday.

01:08:04.881 --> 01:08:06.416
Perfect weekend.

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:10.287
- Let me give you a
ride back to the city.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:11.455
- No.
- Unless you want

01:08:11.488 --> 01:08:13.557
to stay here all weekend.

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:16.760
- Fine.

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:23.233
I was trying to leave
before anybody woke up.

01:08:23.267 --> 01:08:24.401
- Me, too,

01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:27.537
except Dave was already up.
- Oh.

01:08:27.571 --> 01:08:30.174
- Can you believe he
asked Mary to marry him?

01:08:30.207 --> 01:08:31.575
- It's nice.

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:32.442
- It is.

01:08:33.777 --> 01:08:36.912
Nancy, I just want to say I--

01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:39.149
- Peter, not now.

01:08:39.183 --> 01:08:40.517
- Okay.

01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:47.524
- So, what now?

01:08:48.725 --> 01:08:50.460
We go home.

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:10.413
- I'll see you later.

01:09:10.447 --> 01:09:11.848
- You going to meet Peter?

01:09:11.881 --> 01:09:13.950
- Yeah, me and George are
going to take him out to lunch.

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:15.219
You want to go with us?

01:09:15.252 --> 01:09:16.620
No.

01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:18.287
- All right, I'll tell
him you said, "Hi."

01:09:18.322 --> 01:09:20.224
- Please don't.
- Okay.

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:25.194
Mary says, "Hi."

01:09:25.229 --> 01:09:26.029
- Really?

01:09:26.062 --> 01:09:27.863
That's nice, I
thought she hated me.

01:09:27.897 --> 01:09:28.898
- No.

01:09:28.932 --> 01:09:30.600
- So, is George coming?

01:09:30.634 --> 01:09:31.801
- He said he is.

01:09:31.835 --> 01:09:33.002
- I haven't seen
him since the cabin.

01:09:33.036 --> 01:09:36.240
He did send me a very nice
birthday card, which was nice.

01:09:36.273 --> 01:09:37.474
- Did you talk to Nancy?

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:38.308
I did.

01:09:38.341 --> 01:09:38.942
- How'd that go?

01:09:38.975 --> 01:09:40.277
- Not well.

01:09:40.310 --> 01:09:41.678
I'm so glad you came, Nancy.

01:09:41.711 --> 01:09:43.412
- I thought we should talk.

01:09:43.447 --> 01:09:44.948
- I couldn't agree more.

01:09:44.981 --> 01:09:47.617
Look, I am so sorry
about everything

01:09:47.651 --> 01:09:49.286
that happened at the cabin.

01:09:49.319 --> 01:09:51.287
I don't know what was
going through my mind.

01:09:51.321 --> 01:09:52.656
Look, I brought you flowers.

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:53.857
- Peter, stop.

01:09:55.992 --> 01:09:57.561
I'm seeing somebody.

01:09:57.594 --> 01:09:58.762
- You're seeing someone?

01:09:58.795 --> 01:10:00.964
- His name is Frank

01:10:00.997 --> 01:10:02.599
and I don't know if
it's going somewhere,

01:10:02.632 --> 01:10:04.334
but I want to find out.

01:10:04.368 --> 01:10:05.702
- Frank?
- He's,

01:10:08.272 --> 01:10:10.974
nothing like you which is
what I need, right now.

01:10:11.007 --> 01:10:12.008
- That's hurtful.

01:10:13.343 --> 01:10:15.445
- Goodbye, Peter.
- Nan...

01:10:17.314 --> 01:10:18.548
Goodbye, Nancy.

01:10:19.483 --> 01:10:20.917
- I'm sorry, buddy.

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:22.452
- Yeah, me too.

01:10:22.486 --> 01:10:24.388
But, you know, it's okay.

01:10:24.421 --> 01:10:26.890
We tried to make things
work, we tried to fix things

01:10:26.923 --> 01:10:29.459
and we couldn't,
so it's all right.

01:10:29.493 --> 01:10:31.995
- That's a very positive,
and completely unlike-you,

01:10:32.028 --> 01:10:33.196
way of looking at things.

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:37.534
- Thank you, I'm working on
personal growth with Dr. Gordon.

01:10:37.567 --> 01:10:38.702
- I thought Dr.
Gordon was an idiot?

01:10:38.735 --> 01:10:40.404
- Oh, oh, he is, he is an idiot,

01:10:40.437 --> 01:10:41.838
but Nancy seemed to like him,

01:10:41.871 --> 01:10:43.907
so I'm gonna give him a chance.

01:10:43.940 --> 01:10:46.976
- Yeah, so are you
seeing anybody?

01:10:47.010 --> 01:10:48.645
Mary wanted to know if you
wanted to bring a plus one?

01:10:48.678 --> 01:10:50.547
- Yeah, yeah, I
was seeing Susie.

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:52.015
- You're seeing Susie?

01:10:52.048 --> 01:10:55.319
- Emphasis on the word
was, about four months ago.

01:10:55.352 --> 01:10:57.387
It turns out we had
nothing in common.

01:10:57.421 --> 01:10:58.855
She's with someone else, now.

01:10:58.888 --> 01:11:00.357
- Who?
- A real prince.

01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:01.491
- Nice guy, huh?

01:11:01.525 --> 01:11:03.627
- No, no, he's an actual
prince of a European country.

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:05.895
Uh, she got the fairytale
wedding she wanted.

01:11:05.929 --> 01:11:08.332
I think she's, like, third
in the line for the throne.

01:11:08.365 --> 01:11:09.633
She sent me a Christmas card.

01:11:09.666 --> 01:11:10.467
- That's weird.

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:12.001
- Yeah, yeah, it is.

01:11:12.035 --> 01:11:13.937
But, well, you know, when
it's right, it's right,

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:16.306
so I wish her all the
happiness in the world.

01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:17.774
- And, how are you?

01:11:17.807 --> 01:11:22.045
- I'm great, thanks to
my lover, Adam Rosenbaum,

01:11:22.078 --> 01:11:26.750
and you can tell Mary that
I'll be a plus one, a gay one.

01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:28.418
- You could just say, plus one.

01:11:28.452 --> 01:11:29.886
- That's offensive.

01:11:29.919 --> 01:11:33.790
And, you, I am
working on forgiving you for,

01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:39.028
harpooning my Dolphin,
I'm working on it.

01:11:39.062 --> 01:11:39.963
- Thank you?

01:11:39.996 --> 01:11:41.164
- So, are you bringing anybody?

01:11:41.197 --> 01:11:43.567
- Well, I was going to bring
this girl I was seeing, Jane,

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:45.702
but she doesn't want
to see me anymore.

01:11:45.735 --> 01:11:47.371
She said I lacked maturity.

01:11:47.404 --> 01:11:49.773
She's 19, but I lack maturity.

01:11:49.806 --> 01:11:51.007
- 19 is young.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.409
- Who's she gonna
take to the prom, now?

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:55.412
- At least, you got your job.

01:11:55.445 --> 01:11:57.013
- Actually, I do not.

01:11:57.046 --> 01:12:00.016
Apparently, they frown on you
not coming in for two weeks.

01:12:00.049 --> 01:12:01.685
- Jobs do that.
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:01.718 --> 01:12:02.952
- You still have the apartment?

01:12:02.986 --> 01:12:04.354
- Actually, I've been
meaning to talk to you

01:12:04.388 --> 01:12:05.555
about that, you and Mary,

01:12:05.589 --> 01:12:08.057
I'm just gonna need a place
to stay for a couple of weeks,

01:12:08.091 --> 01:12:09.926
just until I get my,
back up on my feet.

01:12:09.959 --> 01:12:12.962
- I would love to, but the
dog and you're allergic, so--

01:12:12.996 --> 01:12:14.464
- I'm not allergic to dogs.

01:12:14.498 --> 01:12:17.100
- But, Mary does not like you.

01:12:17.133 --> 01:12:19.403
- You could stay
with Adam and I.

01:12:19.436 --> 01:12:21.070
- I could sleep on the couch.

01:12:21.104 --> 01:12:23.473
- Actually, he's on business.

01:12:23.507 --> 01:12:25.475
You could stay in bed with me.

01:12:25.509 --> 01:12:26.910
- Nah.
- Remember when we kissed?

01:12:26.943 --> 01:12:28.612
- Yes, I do.
- I do.

01:12:30.647 --> 01:12:32.482
I still love you.

01:12:32.516 --> 01:12:34.384
- You guys kissed?

01:12:34.418 --> 01:12:36.586
Let's show him?

01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:38.455
- So, that was it.

01:12:38.488 --> 01:12:40.457
I'd hit rock bottom:

01:12:40.490 --> 01:12:43.159
no wife, no girlfriend,

01:12:43.192 --> 01:12:46.430
no job, practically homeless.

01:12:46.463 --> 01:12:48.665
Nancy filed for divorce.

01:12:48.698 --> 01:12:52.436
So, it was at that moment,
when I was at my lowest,

01:12:52.469 --> 01:12:55.405
that I decided I needed
to turn my life around.

01:12:55.439 --> 01:12:57.006
I got a new apartment.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:00.444
It's bit of a fixer upper,
but I'll make it work.

01:13:01.811 --> 01:13:03.780
Also, my old company
hired me back.

01:13:05.048 --> 01:13:07.484
Funny enough, it's
Susie's old job.

01:13:07.517 --> 01:13:08.418
Hello?

01:13:08.452 --> 01:13:09.085
It's an entry-level position.

01:13:09.118 --> 01:13:10.019
Oh, hi, Joseph.

01:13:10.053 --> 01:13:11.521
But, I'm told there's
room for advancement.

01:13:11.555 --> 01:13:12.556
Yep, uh huh.

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:18.194
- So, things are
going well, now?

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:20.163
- Yeah, pretty well.

01:13:20.196 --> 01:13:21.197
Dave and Mary got married.

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:22.899
It was a lovely ceremony.

01:13:22.932 --> 01:13:25.535
Mary had me sitting in
the back, by the kitchen.

01:13:25.569 --> 01:13:29.739
I thought she was joking
about that; she was not.

01:13:29.773 --> 01:13:31.207
- I see.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:33.176
- And, Nancy got Dave and Mary
in the divorce, of course,

01:13:33.209 --> 01:13:36.713
so I can only see Dave every
other weekend.

01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:38.414
I'm kidding, mostly.

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:43.787
- Well, you've certainly
been through a lot, Peter,

01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:46.690
but like I always
say, it's the journey

01:13:46.723 --> 01:13:49.959
and not the destination
that's important.

01:13:49.993 --> 01:13:53.497
So, have you learned
anything from your journey?

01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:56.533
- Absolutely.
- That's good, Peter.

01:13:56.566 --> 01:13:57.867
What have you learned?

01:13:57.901 --> 01:14:02.806
- I'm in love with Nancy
and I'm gonna get her back.

01:14:02.839 --> 01:14:04.040
- What?

01:14:04.073 --> 01:14:07.210
- Oh, Frank asked
Nancy to marry her.

01:14:07.243 --> 01:14:09.513
- Ah, I'm sorry.

01:14:09.546 --> 01:14:12.081
- Yeah, I'm going
to the wedding.

01:14:14.984 --> 01:14:17.587
- Were you invited
to the wedding?

01:14:17.621 --> 01:14:19.088
- I'm gonna go to the wedding

01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:22.892
and get Nancy to dump Frank
and get back together with me.

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:29.265
- That's very funny, Peter.

01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:33.737
You are joking, right?

01:14:36.172 --> 01:14:37.473
Right, Peter?

01:14:38.608 --> 01:14:39.308
Peter?

01:14:39.342 --> 01:14:43.813
* And that's where I got started

01:14:43.847 --> 01:14:45.849
* I'm headed back home

01:14:48.618 --> 01:14:50.119
* Boots in the garden

01:14:50.153 --> 01:14:52.188
* Boots in the garden

01:14:52.221 --> 01:14:53.757
* Oh, boots in the garden

01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:55.291
* Boots in the garden

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:57.226
* Boots in the garden

01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:59.195
* Boots in the garden

01:14:59.228 --> 01:15:00.830
* Oh, boots in the garden

01:15:00.864 --> 01:15:02.632
* Boots in the garden

01:15:02.666 --> 01:15:06.269
* Oh, yeah, oh, oh

01:15:06.302 --> 01:15:08.071
* Boots in the garden

01:15:08.104 --> 01:15:10.640
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

01:15:10.674 --> 01:15:13.509
* Ooh ooh hoo hoo

01:15:14.305 --> 01:15:20.905
