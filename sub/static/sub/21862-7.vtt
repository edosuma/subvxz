<c.speaker><i>and you will fool everyone. </i>

01:10.375 --> 01:13.083
<c.speaker>There's a powerful malvago
frozen like a statue

01:13.083 --> 01:14.375
<c.speaker>in a palace garden.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.625
<c.speaker>A malvago could get us
into the Treasury

01:16.625 --> 01:18.250
<c.speaker>to steal that tiara.

01:18.250 --> 01:21.625

01:27.000 --> 01:30.625
<c.speakerTop>...and as the legend goes,
an explorer was sent off

01:30.625 --> 01:34.583
<c.speakerTop>by royal decree to explore
unchartered lands.

01:34.583 --> 01:37.750
<c.speakerTop>His heartbroken wife
cried nonstop,

01:37.750 --> 01:40.208
<c.speakerTop>and her tears, filled with love,

01:40.208 --> 01:42.291
<c.speakerTop>seeped into the barren ground.

01:42.291 --> 01:43.291
<c.speakerTop>[gasp]

01:43.291 --> 01:44.708
<c.speaker>I know, right?!

01:44.708 --> 01:46.000
<c.speaker>But it gets better.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.500
<c.speaker>Oh, then please go on!

01:47.500 --> 01:49.750
<c.speaker>When the explorer
finally returned,

01:49.750 --> 01:52.833
<c.speaker>the ground was covered
with his wife's favorite flower,

01:52.833 --> 01:54.416
<c.speaker>the sunflower.

01:54.416 --> 01:58.333
<c.speaker>Her undying love gave
the barren land
its first spring.

01:58.333 --> 02:00.291
<c.speaker>-Aww!
-Ugh!

02:00.291 --> 02:03.333
<c.speaker>And that's what
The Sunflower Festival
is all about,

02:03.333 --> 02:05.875
<c.speaker>celebrating love
and new beginnings.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.458
<c.speaker>What a sweet story.

02:07.458 --> 02:10.333
<c.speaker>It really tugged
my heartstrings.

02:10.333 --> 02:13.291
<c.speaker>My parents loved it
so much that we used to
perform a song

02:13.291 --> 02:17.458
<c.speaker>inspired by the story
at every Sunflower Festival.

02:17.458 --> 02:19.250
<c.speaker>[sigh] This will be the first
year we've done it without them.

02:23.333 --> 02:25.458
<c.speaker>Aww. I'm sorry.

02:25.458 --> 02:26.708
<c.speaker>Thanks, Naomi.

02:28.333 --> 02:29.625
<c.speaker>Princess Elena!

02:29.625 --> 02:30.875
<c.speaker>Armando!

02:30.875 --> 02:32.625
<c.speaker>The palace looks great!

02:32.625 --> 02:33.875
<c.speaker>Thanks, Your Highness!

02:33.875 --> 02:35.458
<c.speaker>The singers and musicians
will be here

02:35.458 --> 02:36.458
<c.speaker>in an hour for practice.

02:36.458 --> 02:37.875
<c.speaker>[gasp]
Huh?

02:39.416 --> 02:41.416
<c.speaker>Oh, here,
let me take those.

02:41.416 --> 02:42.875
<c.speaker>(whispers) Not now!

02:42.875 --> 02:44.375
<c.speaker>Rita?

02:44.375 --> 02:45.375
<c.speaker>-Rita!
-Uh!

02:45.375 --> 02:47.416
<c.speaker>Oh! Sorry!

02:47.416 --> 02:49.083
<c.speaker>Here!

02:49.083 --> 02:51.458
<c.speaker>Hey. What's up with your hair?

02:51.458 --> 02:54.500
<c.speaker>Oh! The sun makes
my hair darker.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.291
<c.speaker>Well, I gotta go!
See ya!

02:56.291 --> 02:58.458
<c.speaker>Don't forget we're working on
decorations later!

02:58.458 --> 03:00.375
<c.speaker>-Whoa!
-I'll be there!

03:00.375 --> 03:03.458
<c.speaker>Hmm. I thought hair
turned lighter in the sun.

03:04.750 --> 03:09.250
<c.speaker>[grunts] Ow! Whoa!
[panting]

03:09.250 --> 03:11.875
<c.speaker>You really need to find a more
comfortable meeting place, papá.

03:11.875 --> 03:14.333
<c.speaker>(old voice) And you need--!
[coughing]

03:14.333 --> 03:17.166
<c.speaker>And you need to steal the
Maruvian Spell Breaker potion

03:17.166 --> 03:19.291
<c.speaker>so we can free that malvago.

03:19.291 --> 03:21.458
<c.speaker>Shuriki is losing her patience.

03:21.458 --> 03:23.333
<c.speaker>It's already lost.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.500
<c.speaker>Shuriki, I need more
shape-shifting potion.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.458
<c.speaker>The spell is wearing off.

03:27.458 --> 03:30.333
<c.speaker>And whose fault is that, Carla?

03:30.333 --> 03:31.708
<c.speaker>You've been "Rita" for weeks.

03:31.708 --> 03:35.166
<c.speaker>Is it that hard to swipe
a potion from a boy wizard?

03:35.166 --> 03:36.583
<c.speaker>I've been trying!

03:36.583 --> 03:38.000
<c.speaker>But Elena
has me busy

03:38.000 --> 03:40.375
<c.speaker>preparing for that
flower festival tomorrow.

03:40.375 --> 03:42.583
<c.speaker>She's invited
the entire kingdom.

03:42.583 --> 03:44.833
<c.speaker>And if I have to decorate
one more poster--

03:44.833 --> 03:47.583
<c.speaker>Wait! She invited
the whole Kingdom?

03:47.583 --> 03:48.958
<c.speaker>[gasps]

03:48.958 --> 03:51.500
<c.speaker>So the gates will be open
to all visitors?

03:51.500 --> 03:54.000
<c.speaker>Uh, yeah. How else
are they going to get in?

03:54.000 --> 03:56.375
<c.speaker>Suddenly, I feel...

03:56.375 --> 03:58.375
<c.speaker>[shudder] festive.

03:58.375 --> 04:00.125
<c.speaker>You? Festive?

04:00.125 --> 04:02.083
<c.speaker>You feel?

04:02.083 --> 04:03.583
<c.speaker>I have a new plan.

04:03.583 --> 04:06.250
<c.speaker>Tomorrow, Victor and I will
attend the festival

04:06.250 --> 04:09.583
<c.speaker>with the other partygoers.
And if you haven't stolen

04:09.583 --> 04:13.166
<c.speaker>the potion by then,
I will do it myself.

04:13.166 --> 04:15.583
<c.speaker>[sigh] I can do it!

04:15.583 --> 04:17.583
<c.speaker>Either way, tomorrow

04:17.583 --> 04:20.750
<c.speaker>I will turn that statue
back into Fiero.

04:20.750 --> 04:23.416
<c.speaker>And he will steal
the magic jewel I need

04:23.416 --> 04:25.583
<c.speaker>to make a new wand.

04:25.583 --> 04:27.458
<c.speaker>Then we take over Avalor.

04:27.458 --> 04:30.458
<c.speaker>Then <i>I </i>take over Avalor!

04:30.458 --> 04:33.750
<c.speaker>And you finally
get to become malvagos.

04:33.750 --> 04:35.583
<c.speaker>If you don't mess it all up.

04:35.583 --> 04:38.750
<c.speaker>Here, cover your hair
and get back to the castle.

04:38.750 --> 04:40.958
<c.speaker>I will get that potion.

04:40.958 --> 04:43.583
<c.speaker>See you at the festival.

<c.speaker>What, what, what?!

05:17.458 --> 05:19.708
<c.speaker>Christina,
you should join the dance.

05:19.708 --> 05:21.458
<c.speaker>I'd love that,

05:21.458 --> 05:24.166
<c.speaker>but it's kinda hard
to dance on wheels.

05:24.166 --> 05:26.625
<c.speaker>Especially a dance
with so many steps.

05:26.625 --> 05:28.625
<c.speaker>Then we'll just
have to change them!

05:28.625 --> 05:29.625
<c.speaker>Really?

05:29.625 --> 05:32.000
<c.speaker>Why not change
it up this year?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.458
<c.speaker>You would do that
for my daughter?

05:33.458 --> 05:35.458
<c.speaker>Of course.

05:35.458 --> 05:37.458
<c.speaker>Elena and I
will plan it tonight

05:37.458 --> 05:39.625
<c.speaker>and we can meet in the morning
before the festival

05:39.625 --> 05:40.625
<c.speaker>to go over it.

05:40.625 --> 05:41.583
<c.speaker>That's perfect!

05:41.583 --> 05:43.833
<c.speaker>Isn't that
great news, Cristina?

05:43.833 --> 05:45.958
<c.speaker>Yeah, can't wait!

05:48.958 --> 05:52.166
<c.speaker>The time has finally come...

05:52.166 --> 05:55.291
<c.speaker>to put on your festival dresses!

05:55.291 --> 05:56.875
<c.speaker>[gasp] They're beautiful!

05:56.875 --> 05:59.333
<c.speaker>Thanks, Elena!

05:59.333 --> 06:02.166
<c.speaker>I've got one for Rita, too.
Uh, has anyone seen her?

06:02.166 --> 06:03.125
<c.speaker>Not since yesterday.

06:03.125 --> 06:04.416
<c.speaker>Huh, and she never showed up

06:04.416 --> 06:06.000
<c.speaker>to help me finish
the decorations.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.583
<c.speaker>Huh. She's usually
so dependable.

06:08.583 --> 06:11.500
<c.speaker>I'm sure she's around
the castle somewhere.

06:11.500 --> 06:12.750
<c.speaker>I'll find her!

06:22.250 --> 06:24.208
<c.speaker>[knocking]

06:24.208 --> 06:25.416
<c.speaker>Hello?

06:25.416 --> 06:26.583
<c.speaker>Anyone in there?

06:29.458 --> 06:30.583
<c.speaker>Come on!

06:30.583 --> 06:33.208
<c.speaker>Ow!

06:33.208 --> 06:34.416
<c.speaker>-Ah! There you are!
-[gasp]

06:34.416 --> 06:36.291
<c.speaker>Mmm, looking for Mateo?

06:36.291 --> 06:37.875
<c.speaker>Uh, yeah.

06:37.875 --> 06:40.166
<c.speaker>I wanted to surprise him
with chilaquiles.

06:40.166 --> 06:41.583
<c.speaker>I know how much
he loves them.

06:41.583 --> 06:43.291
<c.speaker>That's great, but...

06:43.291 --> 06:45.208
<c.speaker>where are they?

06:45.208 --> 06:46.708
<c.speaker>[nervous chuckle] Oh!

06:46.708 --> 06:48.708
<c.speaker>I... I must have
left them in the kitchen!

06:48.708 --> 06:52.583
<c.speaker>Whoa. The sun is really
doing a number on your hair.

06:52.583 --> 06:55.875
<c.speaker>[laughing] Sure is.

06:55.875 --> 06:58.750
<c.speaker>Anyway! What a pretty dress
you have there.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.750
<c.speaker>It's for you.

07:00.750 --> 07:04.708
<c.speaker>And just so you know,
if the painting is shut,
Mateo's not home.

07:04.708 --> 07:07.458
<c.speaker>C'mon, let's go get ready
for the festival.

07:08.458 --> 07:10.458
<c.speaker>[children laughing]

07:12.083 --> 07:13.458
<c.speaker>We're in.

07:13.458 --> 07:16.000
<c.speaker>Now let's go find Carla.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
<c.speaker>(old voice) Right!
[coughs]

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
<c.speaker>Right!

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
<c.speaker>Okay. Let's try it again.

07:25.750 --> 07:28.000
<c.speaker>♪

07:33.083 --> 07:35.208
<c.speaker>-Ay!
-Oh!

07:35.208 --> 07:36.708
<c.speaker>Oop! Sorry!

07:36.708 --> 07:37.583
<c.speaker>I'm okay.

07:37.583 --> 07:38.583
<c.speaker>-Ahh!
-Sorry!

07:47.291 --> 07:48.958
<c.speaker>What's wrong?

07:48.958 --> 07:51.083
<c.speaker>I'm just getting
in the way.

07:51.083 --> 07:53.625
<c.speaker>And I know how important
this dance is to your family.

07:53.625 --> 07:56.458
<c.speaker>Cristina, you're not in the way.

07:56.458 --> 07:58.458
<c.speaker>And we have plenty more time
to practice

07:58.458 --> 07:59.833
<c.speaker>before the festival starts.

07:59.833 --> 08:02.583
<c.speaker>[trumpets]

08:02.583 --> 08:04.291
<c.speaker>The festival's starting!

08:04.291 --> 08:06.708
<c.speaker>Or not. But you know
all the moves.

08:06.708 --> 08:07.500
<c.speaker>You'll be fine.

08:08.875 --> 08:10.583
<c.speaker>[sigh] Okay.

08:14.083 --> 08:15.583
<c.speaker>Oh! Elena!

08:15.583 --> 08:18.708
<c.speaker>Wow! The dress looks
great on you.

08:18.708 --> 08:20.125
<c.speaker>-Did you find Rita?
-Yeah.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.416
<c.speaker>Can I talk to you
for a second?

08:21.416 --> 08:23.625
<c.speaker>Um, why don't you all
go on ahead?

08:23.625 --> 08:24.875
<c.speaker>I'll be right out.

08:24.875 --> 08:26.625
<c.speaker>Okay! We'll
see you there.

08:26.625 --> 08:28.083
<c.speaker>What's up?

08:28.083 --> 08:30.708
<c.speaker>I caught Rita poking around
by Mateo's workshop,

08:30.708 --> 08:31.708
<c.speaker>acting all weird.

08:31.708 --> 08:33.875
<c.speaker>[sigh] Not this again.

08:33.875 --> 08:36.250
<c.speaker>Naomi, the last time you thought
she was acting weird,

08:36.250 --> 08:37.708
<c.speaker>it turned out to be nothing.

08:37.708 --> 08:39.333
<c.speaker>But this time,
it's different.

08:39.333 --> 08:41.291
<c.speaker>-How?
-I'm not sure.

08:41.291 --> 08:43.625
<c.speaker>I just have a gut feeling
she's up to something.

08:43.625 --> 08:45.000
<c.speaker>You've gotta trust me.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.291
<c.speaker>I do, but you have to
give me more to go on

08:47.291 --> 08:48.708
<c.speaker>than just a gut feeling.

08:48.708 --> 08:51.333
<c.speaker>Okay, fine.
I'll get you proof.

08:51.333 --> 08:55.000
<c.speaker>Or, you can remember that this
is a festival of new beginnings

08:55.000 --> 08:57.875
<c.speaker>and you can give your friendship
with Rita a fresh start.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.458
<c.speaker>Hmm. I like my plan better.

09:08.166 --> 09:09.250
<c.speaker>-Oh!
-Ugh!

09:14.375 --> 09:15.375
<c.speaker>Mateo!

09:15.375 --> 09:17.333
<c.speaker>You got my name right!

09:17.333 --> 09:19.208
<c.speaker>[giggling] Let's dance!

09:19.208 --> 09:20.833
<c.speaker>Uh, okay!

09:20.833 --> 09:22.833
<c.speaker>But I should warn you,
I have two left feet.

09:22.833 --> 09:24.583
<c.speaker>Oh! [laughs]

09:24.583 --> 09:27.208
<c.speaker>And I have two right feet,
so we're a perfect match.

09:27.208 --> 09:28.208
<c.speaker>Oh! [nervous chuckle]

09:29.333 --> 09:31.333
<c.speaker>Cha-cha!
[dancing grunts]

09:35.875 --> 09:37.583
<c.speaker>I was looking for you earlier,

09:37.583 --> 09:39.708
<c.speaker>but I couldn't figure out
how to open the painting.

09:39.708 --> 09:41.875
<c.speaker>What do you have to do?
Say "open sesame",

09:41.875 --> 09:43.875
<c.speaker>"ábrete sésamo"
or something?

09:43.875 --> 09:46.833
<c.speaker>No, you just need the key.
It used to take three keys,

09:46.833 --> 09:49.750
<c.speaker>but the door got blown up.
It's a long story.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.875
<c.speaker>You'll have to
tell me sometime.

09:51.875 --> 09:53.583
<c.speaker>[dancing grunts]

09:57.875 --> 10:00.000
<c.speaker>[chicken noises]

10:02.958 --> 10:03.958
<c.speaker>-Whoa!
-[giggles]

10:03.958 --> 10:05.958
<c.speaker>-Ow!
-Whoops!

10:06.958 --> 10:07.958
<c.speaker>Ugh!

10:07.958 --> 10:09.708
<c.speaker>Sorry about that!

10:09.708 --> 10:12.708
<c.speaker>Ah, don't be! I was the one
who dropped you.

10:12.708 --> 10:14.333
<c.speaker>Anyway, thanks for the dance!

10:14.333 --> 10:15.708
<c.speaker>Whoa!

10:15.708 --> 10:17.083
<c.speaker>[evil chuckle]

10:17.083 --> 10:19.833
<c.speaker>But the song
isn't over yet.

10:19.833 --> 10:21.750
<c.speaker>Oh! Ha, thanks, Naomi.

10:21.750 --> 10:22.875
<c.speaker>Where's Rita?

10:22.875 --> 10:23.750
<c.speaker>Oh! She's right--

10:23.750 --> 10:25.625
<c.speaker>Uh, where'd she go?

10:32.291 --> 10:33.583
<c.speaker>Okay.

10:33.583 --> 10:35.833
<c.speaker>I just need to find
the keyhole.

10:37.958 --> 10:38.958
<c.speaker>Is that...?

10:48.500 --> 10:51.458
<c.speaker>Now, where are the potions?

10:54.875 --> 10:57.750
<c.speaker>Ugh! Which one is it?!

10:57.750 --> 11:00.833
<c.speaker>[growls] That, no, no, no, no.

11:02.750 --> 11:04.416
<c.speaker>"Enlarging potion".
No.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.958
<c.speaker>"Ensmalling potion".
Nope.

11:08.958 --> 11:10.958
<c.speaker>-[sad whimper]
-"Disappearing potion".

11:10.958 --> 11:12.583
<c.speaker>-Nope!
-[tiny scream]

11:12.583 --> 11:16.083
<c.speaker>Maruvian Spell Breaker! Finally!

11:28.375 --> 11:30.208
<c.speaker>What are you up to?

11:39.583 --> 11:40.583
<c.speaker>[gasp]

11:42.416 --> 11:43.416
<c.speaker>Hmm...

11:46.958 --> 11:48.250
<c.speaker>Is that Mateo's potion?

11:48.250 --> 11:50.375
<c.speaker>-[mariachi music]
-[grunting] Excuse me!

11:51.875 --> 11:54.000
<c.speaker>Uh, excuse me!
Can you...

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
<c.speaker>Ah! [gasp]

11:58.000 --> 12:00.375
<c.speaker>Ugh. I've gotta find Mateo.

12:02.875 --> 12:04.458
<c.speaker>Mateo! [panting]

12:04.458 --> 12:06.500
<c.speaker>I just saw Rita with one
of your potion vials.

12:06.500 --> 12:07.958
<c.speaker>That's impossible.

12:07.958 --> 12:10.458
<c.speaker>My potions are all locked up
in my workshop,

12:10.458 --> 12:12.958
<c.speaker>and I'm the only one
with the key.

12:14.875 --> 12:16.708
<c.speaker>It's... it's gone.

12:16.708 --> 12:19.708
<c.speaker>I knew she was up to something
while you two were dancing.

12:19.708 --> 12:21.708
<c.speaker>Wow! You danced with Rita?

12:21.708 --> 12:23.875
<c.speaker>Why, yes. I did.

12:23.875 --> 12:25.125
<c.speaker>Guys, focus!

12:25.125 --> 12:28.000
<c.speaker>I saw her give the potion
to a man and a woman,

12:28.000 --> 12:29.583
<c.speaker>but then I lost 'em.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.875
<c.speaker>I'll check my workshop
to see if anything's missing.

12:31.875 --> 12:32.875
<c.speaker>I'll check
the rest of the palace.

12:32.875 --> 12:34.500
<c.speaker>And I'll tell Elena!

12:36.000 --> 12:37.833
<c.speaker>The malvago's statue
is over here.

12:44.083 --> 12:45.958
<c.speaker>Well done, Carla.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.416
<c.speaker>I never thought
I'd hear you say that.

12:49.416 --> 12:50.958
<c.speaker>Neither did I.

13:01.375 --> 13:02.375
<c.speaker>No!

13:02.375 --> 13:04.083
<c.speaker>Calm down, Fiero.

13:06.375 --> 13:07.708
<c.speaker>Shuriki?

13:07.708 --> 13:10.708
<c.speaker>Your battle with
the royal wizard is over.

13:10.708 --> 13:13.125
<c.speaker>The bad news is you lost

13:13.125 --> 13:15.416
<c.speaker>and the boy
turned you to stone.

13:15.416 --> 13:17.500
<c.speaker>And the good news?

13:17.500 --> 13:19.833
<c.speaker>I just freed you.

13:19.833 --> 13:22.708
<c.speaker>So now you owe me.

13:22.708 --> 13:26.958
<c.speaker>I owe you nothing.
You banished me
from Avalor years ago.

13:26.958 --> 13:28.375
<c.speaker>Join the club.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.125
<c.speaker>That's all in the past now

13:30.125 --> 13:32.000
<c.speaker>and if I were in your robe,

13:32.000 --> 13:35.000
<c.speaker>I'd start thinking
about your future.

13:35.000 --> 13:39.208
<c.speaker>Now, I need you to get me
into the Royal Treasury.

13:39.208 --> 13:42.416
<c.speaker>I will help you
on one condition.

13:42.416 --> 13:45.291
<c.speaker>The royal wizard has
a book of magic spells

13:45.291 --> 13:48.000
<c.speaker>called the Codex Maru.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.500
<c.speaker>I want it.

13:49.500 --> 13:51.708
<c.speaker>Oh! Is that all?

13:51.708 --> 13:53.583
<c.speaker>Then we have a deal.

14:02.875 --> 14:06.083
<c.speaker>Welcome to
the Sunflower Festival.

14:06.083 --> 14:07.625
<c.speaker>I'm happy to bring back
this tradition

14:07.625 --> 14:10.000
<c.speaker>which reminds us
that every Spring

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
<c.speaker>brings a new beginning.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.083
<c.speaker>And so,
I dedicate this new dance

14:15.083 --> 14:18.000
<c.speaker>to the memory of my parents.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
<c.speaker>Everybody ready?

14:23.458 --> 14:26.166
<c.speaker>No. I can't do it.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.875
<c.speaker>I'm sorry.

14:27.875 --> 14:31.458
<c.speaker>Cristina, the last time
Isa and I did this dance,

14:31.458 --> 14:33.166
<c.speaker>it was with our parents.

14:33.166 --> 14:35.750
<c.speaker>I know, that's why
I can't do it.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.958
<c.speaker>It's too important
and I'm gonna mess it up.

14:37.958 --> 14:41.000
<c.speaker>I'm gonna let you in on
a little secret.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.583
<c.speaker>I didn't get the steps down

14:42.583 --> 14:45.000
<c.speaker>the first time I performed
the dance either.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.250
<c.speaker>You didn't?

14:46.250 --> 14:47.375
<c.speaker>No.

14:47.375 --> 14:49.833
<c.speaker>But my father was
proud of me for trying.

14:49.833 --> 14:52.000
<c.speaker>Just like your father
is proud of you now.

14:54.750 --> 14:56.416
<c.speaker>Okay, I'll do it.

14:56.416 --> 14:57.583
<c.speaker>Great!

14:57.583 --> 14:59.375
<c.speaker>All right, we're ready.

16:49.125 --> 16:50.250
<c.speaker>Elena!

16:50.250 --> 16:51.333
<c.speaker>You wanted more than
a gut feeling.

16:51.333 --> 16:52.166
<c.speaker>Well, I've got it.

16:52.166 --> 16:53.333
<c.speaker>Ahh!

16:53.333 --> 16:55.333
<c.speaker>What happened?

16:55.333 --> 16:56.416
<c.speaker>Fiero?!

16:56.416 --> 16:57.416
<c.speaker>BOQATO!

16:57.416 --> 16:59.125
<c.speaker>Ahh!

<c.speaker>Hmm...

17:10.166 --> 17:13.458
<c.speaker>Fiero, you have
the Codex Maru. Let's go.

17:13.458 --> 17:15.208
<c.speaker>Yeah, maybe you
can read that later.

17:17.291 --> 17:18.291
<c.speaker>CANAZA!

17:32.583 --> 17:35.000
<c.speaker>How do you know
it was a vial of potion?

17:35.000 --> 17:37.458
<c.speaker>Because I saw it
with my own two eyes.

18:17.708 --> 18:19.291
<c.speaker>and Carla?!

18:19.291 --> 18:21.416
<c.speaker>You were Rita?

18:21.416 --> 18:23.166
<c.speaker>And you were clueless.

18:26.583 --> 18:27.833
<c.speaker>VADISIMA!

18:29.958 --> 18:33.250
<c.speaker>Come out, come out
wherever you are, Elena.

18:33.250 --> 18:35.458
<c.speaker>[panting] I have to
get my scepter.

<c.speaker>Let's focus on
not getting blasted first.

18:40.875 --> 18:42.375
<c.speaker>Ahh! Oof!

18:42.375 --> 18:45.375
<c.speaker>There's no amulet
to protect you this time.

18:45.375 --> 18:46.375

<c.speaker>-Nice shot!
-Thanks.

18:58.333 --> 19:01.583
<c.speaker>[groans] How did
the scepter do that?

19:01.583 --> 19:03.333
<c.speaker>[grunts] CONGLARI!

19:03.333 --> 19:04.333
<c.speaker>XIMOCU!

<c.speaker>My wand!

19:21.833 --> 19:23.875
<c.speaker>Drop the wand, Fiero.

19:23.875 --> 19:26.375
<c.speaker>That scepter is
too powerful, Shuriki.

19:26.375 --> 19:27.375
<c.speaker>We must go.

19:27.375 --> 19:30.333
<c.speaker>Put it down!

19:30.333 --> 19:32.125
<c.speaker>I would rather put it up!

19:32.125 --> 19:33.166
<c.speaker>BOQATO!

19:36.000 --> 19:37.333
<c.speaker>Ahh!

19:38.583 --> 19:39.833
<c.speaker>[panting]

19:41.416 --> 19:44.125
<c.speaker>I cannot let her get away.

19:44.125 --> 19:45.333
<c.speaker>Elena, wait!

19:47.708 --> 19:50.000
<c.speaker>[panting] Oh!
How did she do that?!

19:50.000 --> 19:52.458
<c.speaker>The Royal Scepter
couldn't do anything
magical before.

19:52.458 --> 19:55.375
<c.speaker>Don't worry. These pages will
lead us to something

19:55.375 --> 19:57.125
<c.speaker>even more powerful.

19:57.125 --> 19:58.750
<c.speaker>Those pages are blank!

19:58.750 --> 20:01.375
<c.speaker>Or are they?
QUITTIZ!

20:04.166 --> 20:06.333
<c.speaker>[gasp] What does it say?

20:06.333 --> 20:09.625
<c.speaker>How we can defeat
Princess Elena.

20:09.625 --> 20:12.083
<c.speaker>But, before I tell you,

20:12.083 --> 20:14.333
<c.speaker>I want something in return.

20:14.333 --> 20:16.125
<c.speaker>What is that?

20:16.125 --> 20:18.500
<c.speaker>What I have always wanted.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.708
<c.speaker>To be the Royal Malvago.

20:20.708 --> 20:23.416
<c.speaker>-Ugh! What about us?
-Yeah?

20:23.416 --> 20:26.375
<c.speaker>I will make you malvagos
once you have earned it.

20:26.375 --> 20:29.708
<c.speaker>But Fiero will be
my Royal Malvago!

20:32.000 --> 20:34.583
<c.speaker>Then we better move quickly.
We have much to do.

20:39.708 --> 20:41.458
<c.speaker>-Whoa, Canela!
-[horse whinny]

20:43.500 --> 20:45.625
<c.speaker>[horse snorts]

20:45.625 --> 20:47.708
<c.speaker>I can't tell
which way they went.

20:47.708 --> 20:49.750
<c.speaker>Don't worry. I'll assemble
the Royal Guard.

20:49.750 --> 20:51.000
<c.speaker>We'll track them down.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.375
<c.speaker>There's no time to wait.

20:52.375 --> 20:53.708
<c.speaker>We'll have to split up.

20:53.708 --> 20:55.083
<c.speaker>Ah, no way.

20:55.083 --> 20:56.583
<c.speaker>It's not safe for you
out there alone.

20:56.583 --> 20:58.000
<c.speaker>And there's
no trace of them.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.583
<c.speaker>We'd just be
searching blindly.

21:03.250 --> 21:05.000
<c.speaker>We should head back
to the festival.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.583
<c.speaker>People will start wondering
where you are.

21:06.583 --> 21:10.458
<c.speaker>But, [sigh]
You're right.

21:10.458 --> 21:12.250
<c.speaker>Gabe, assemble
the guard.

21:15.750 --> 21:17.416
<c.speaker>Naomi.

21:17.416 --> 21:19.458
<c.speaker>I should've listened
to you about Rita.

21:19.458 --> 21:21.625
<c.speaker>Ugh, I mean Carla.

21:22.625 --> 21:24.000
<c.speaker>I'm sorry.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.208
<c.speaker>You don't need to apologize.

21:26.208 --> 21:28.458
<c.speaker>The Sunflower Festival
is all about new beginnings,

21:28.458 --> 21:30.583
<c.speaker>-right?
-Right.

21:30.583 --> 21:33.250
<c.speaker>Then maybe we can
begin again, too.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.166
<c.speaker>And this time,
you'll trust me more?

21:35.166 --> 21:37.875
<c.speaker>You have my word.

21:37.875 --> 21:41.083
<c.speaker>The sunbird oracle said
darkness was coming.

21:41.083 --> 21:43.208
<c.speaker>And here it is.

21:43.208 --> 21:46.416
<c.speaker>This must be the big test
Quita Moz spoke of.

21:46.416 --> 21:49.166
<c.speakerTop>I have to stop Shuriki.

21:49.166 --> 21:51.583
<c.speakerTop>Once and forever.

21:51.583 --> 21:53.625
<c.speakerTop>-[grunt]

22:03.625 --> 22:06.416
