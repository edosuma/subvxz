Jimmy, look out!

01:21.365 --> 01:23.165
You all right?

01:24.051 --> 01:27.102
Yeah. I think I got a few scratches.

01:27.579 --> 01:28.879
How about you?

01:30.626 --> 01:31.984
I'm caught.

01:32.084 --> 01:35.377
- Over there. See if you can lift it.
- Okay.

01:38.840 --> 01:40.207
Damn!

01:42.853 --> 01:45.212
Here, let me help you up.

01:46.181 --> 01:47.681
Shit!

01:51.661 --> 01:53.964
Put your arm around me.

01:54.064 --> 01:55.698
Over there.

02:06.780 --> 02:08.036
I'll find help.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.903
Hello? Hello?

02:43.071 --> 02:44.671
Shit.

03:05.410 --> 03:06.619
Jimmy?

03:08.989 --> 03:10.489
Jim!

03:13.443 --> 03:14.702
Jimmy?

03:28.167 --> 03:29.967
Jimmy!

03:37.376 --> 03:39.376
Jim?

06:18.553 --> 06:21.355
Filth! Don't you know better?

06:21.690 --> 06:22.690
Filth!

06:30.690 --> 06:32.649
Wake up pigs!

06:34.486 --> 06:36.512
Eggar, what the hell you doing in here?

06:44.129 --> 06:46.813
Morning Eggar, up to your old tricks?

06:50.835 --> 06:54.171
- Hey Zorich!
- Get the hell out of here!

06:55.256 --> 06:58.151
- Wake up!
- You goddamn geek.

06:58.251 --> 07:01.338
- Who you calling geek, boy?
- You wanna mess with me?

07:01.538 --> 07:03.597
You want to dance?

07:15.051 --> 07:16.552
Hey, cupcake.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.039
You better find someone
to take care of you.

07:22.250 --> 07:24.950
I don't need anybody to take care of me.

07:29.816 --> 07:31.910
Go on, get out of here!

07:32.010 --> 07:33.836
You heard him Eggar.

07:36.498 --> 07:39.209
10 number 10 cans is missing
from my store room.

07:39.309 --> 07:42.794
You got to sign. I'm not
coming up short in my pantry.

07:43.346 --> 07:46.648
Now, you make sure those boys
behave themselves, you hear?

07:46.750 --> 07:48.150
There.

07:48.435 --> 07:51.179
Mike, this is crazy. Why in the
hell are you bringing us along?

07:51.279 --> 07:53.588
Man, this whole thing is bullshit.

07:54.507 --> 07:56.993
It's just for my man to get
off with his lady, huh?

07:57.093 --> 08:00.688
See the kind of gratitude I get? I go
out of my way, I go out on a limb,

08:00.788 --> 08:03.041
to set it up so these guys
can have a little holiday.

08:03.141 --> 08:06.936
- Well, how many girls are coming along?
- 3, plus my girlfriend.

08:07.036 --> 08:08.412
Yeah, but what do they look like?

08:08.880 --> 08:14.903
Listen. These are very classy ladies.
I want you guys to try to be gentlemen.

08:15.003 --> 08:17.931
Be polite and try to be cool.

08:18.031 --> 08:22.492
- Well, you know us.
- That's exactly what I mean.

08:22.635 --> 08:24.578
Why's Eggar coming?

08:24.929 --> 08:28.240
Coming along so he can pick us up
on Friday when we get off the river.

08:28.375 --> 08:31.444
You better keep him away from
us before he gets his ass kicked.

08:31.544 --> 08:34.145
He's already starting on Cerone.

08:35.456 --> 08:39.501
Okay. I'm going to talk to him.

08:39.678 --> 08:42.996
Why don't you guys come
along and help him load the bus.

08:44.099 --> 08:47.542
Oh, and Dennis? Wear some underwear.

08:52.757 --> 08:54.615
A forestry worker and a female companion

08:54.715 --> 08:56.812
are missing in the North
Mill Creek vicinity.

08:56.912 --> 08:58.637
- Authorities are continuing the search.
- Eggar!

08:58.856 --> 09:00.849
The weather will continue
fair through tomorrow...

09:00.949 --> 09:03.976
- Eggar!
- Over here.

09:07.497 --> 09:11.384
Hey, what's going on man?
I just got orders, a change in plans.

09:11.484 --> 09:13.320
You're going to go to Mill
Creek instead of Wolf Creek.

09:13.420 --> 09:15.363
That's 30 miles further than
where we're supposed to go.

09:15.463 --> 09:18.116
Mill Creek's real dangerous. You don't
want to take these kids out over there.

09:18.316 --> 09:19.458
Somebody might get hurt.

09:19.592 --> 09:23.204
What the hell is the matter with you Eggar?
I thought we understood each other.

09:23.304 --> 09:26.581
Now, the bus was supposed
to be ready to go an hour ago.

09:26.933 --> 09:30.645
The bus was ready to go an hour ago.
I do your job for you, didn't I?

09:30.745 --> 09:33.022
I had to wake your baby
punks out of bed!

09:33.122 --> 09:35.241
And you're using a state
vehicle for personal business

09:35.341 --> 09:37.802
and you're transporting outsiders.
Now, I know who you're taking.

09:37.902 --> 09:39.246
And I know what you're
going to do with her too.

09:39.346 --> 09:42.674
This is still a work detail.
I've got all the authorization I need!

09:42.774 --> 09:45.952
You let that garbage do what they want
instead of teaching them right from wrong!

09:46.052 --> 09:47.562
Listen Eggar,
let's get something straight.

09:47.662 --> 09:49.939
I'll take care of my job and
you take care of yours.

09:50.039 --> 09:53.042
Mine is to plan the work details
and yours it to get me there.

09:53.142 --> 09:55.954
What the hell you think they're gonna
do out there in the woods with girls?

09:56.054 --> 09:57.321
Pray?

10:04.333 --> 10:06.312
Let's see what we got here.

10:10.852 --> 10:11.961
Come on, cool it!

10:12.061 --> 10:13.504
- Oh, man.
- Morning, sir!

10:15.206 --> 10:17.023
Mama looks good.

10:22.839 --> 10:24.439
Thank you.

10:24.824 --> 10:27.392
It's a really nice house you
have here, Mr. Morgan.

10:28.094 --> 10:30.313
- We had a little automotive difficulties.
- I understand.

10:30.413 --> 10:32.814
These are my boys from the camp.

10:33.533 --> 10:34.993
Do you believe all this shit?

10:35.293 --> 10:36.536
Bye dear.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.463
- Bye mom, bye daddy.
- Bye dear.

10:38.563 --> 10:41.999
- What about that missing couple?
- They'll be okay, there's 3 adults.

10:43.051 --> 10:45.335
Got more rafts than the Navy.

10:46.879 --> 10:49.324
- Leave her alone.
- You can come sit over here with me.

10:49.424 --> 10:52.419
- Oh shit.
- Okay, get on, all right.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.613
We're going to take real good
care of your daughters here,

10:54.713 --> 10:56.464
don't you worry about anything.

11:01.361 --> 11:05.557
3 blind mice, 3 blind mice.

11:05.857 --> 11:10.270
3 blind mice, 3 blind mice.

11:10.370 --> 11:14.689
- They all ran after the farmer's wife.
- 3 blind mice, 3 blind mice.

11:16.876 --> 11:20.246
3 blind mice, 3 blind mice!

11:20.346 --> 11:24.659
- Hallelujah!
- 3 blind mice, 3 blind mice.

11:24.759 --> 11:26.358
Oh, yeah!

11:28.988 --> 11:31.715
Did you ever see such
a sight in your life?

11:33.034 --> 11:37.005
3 blind mice! 3 blind mice!

11:37.105 --> 11:39.806
See how they run!

11:50.743 --> 11:53.330
- The bus will take us to this point, here.
- That'll be the work site.

11:53.430 --> 11:55.207
- This is where we're going to work, yeah.
- Where is the work site?

11:55.307 --> 11:57.409
Right there. We're going to go
to the stream for fish and game.

11:57.509 --> 12:00.954
Ain't that where you took us before?
That's a long way in there.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.789
Yeah, it's about 30 miles deeper in.

12:02.889 --> 12:06.985
Yeah, we're going to hike about 15
miles down to a place called Mill Creek.

12:07.085 --> 12:09.454
And then the rafts will meet us
there at the forestry outpost.

12:09.554 --> 12:10.780
How do the rafts get there?

12:10.880 --> 12:13.366
Oh, well Eggar will take them.
Yeah, he'll meet us there with the bus.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.657
Then we're going to raft about 30
miles down to a place that, Mike,

12:16.757 --> 12:18.830
- what's the name of that place you told me about?
- Happy Camp.

12:18.930 --> 12:21.258
- What kind of bear they got up there?
- Big.

12:21.358 --> 12:24.528
- You mean you girls gonna work for us?
- Sure!

12:24.628 --> 12:28.648
Does anyone really know the way?
Hey Mel, are there any deer there?

12:28.848 --> 12:31.300
Look, all I can tell you is it's wild,

12:31.400 --> 12:33.895
it's practically untouched
and you're going to love it.

12:33.995 --> 12:36.022
It's really beautiful,
you're just going to love it.

12:36.122 --> 12:38.174
Ain't no reason to be there.
Trails don't need no clearing

12:38.274 --> 12:39.651
and the streams ain't no good.

12:39.751 --> 12:41.803
Lot of wild animals.
You girls ain't never been up there.

12:41.903 --> 12:43.922
You going to have a lot of trouble
with these dried out trees.

12:44.022 --> 12:47.132
They keep... logs keep falling down,
branches and stuff.

12:47.267 --> 12:50.954
Couple friends of mine got hurt up there
a couple years ago, one man was killed.

12:51.054 --> 12:55.274
I know a stretch a patch about 30 miles
north of here that would be a lot easier

12:55.374 --> 12:57.961
for y'all to get through.
It got a lot of nice streaming up there

12:58.061 --> 13:01.239
and y'all have a better time doing
it that way and nobody get hurt.

13:01.339 --> 13:03.542
If I do get you up there,
y'all going to be bitching and moaning

13:03.642 --> 13:07.253
about how dark it is and how rough it is.
Come 12 o'clock, midnight,

13:07.353 --> 13:10.006
- I won't be there to help y'all.
- Why don't you just drive the bus all right?

13:10.106 --> 13:12.526
I'm just warning you.
Somebody's going to get hurt, you do that.

13:13.493 --> 13:14.886
- I'm going to tell them Eggar.
- Shut up back there!

13:14.986 --> 13:17.313
- I'm going to tell them all about you.
- You hear me Zorich?

13:17.413 --> 13:20.750
I ain't going to take your
shit no more! You hear me?

13:26.047 --> 13:29.499
Hey Eggar, isn't that your old home?

13:31.294 --> 13:34.338
You know what that is Windy?
A mental institution.

13:58.788 --> 14:00.690
- Don't put that there.
- Where's your gloves, goddammit?

14:00.790 --> 14:03.401
- Come on.
- Boone, wear your gloves next time!

14:03.501 --> 14:04.376
Shit.

14:05.294 --> 14:07.697
You'll be much more comfortable
if you wear them, darling.

14:07.797 --> 14:08.781
Here.

14:10.950 --> 14:15.378
You do that on purpose? It ain't funny,
goddammit! That's how people get hurt!

14:17.406 --> 14:19.600
- Hey, Eggar!
- Leave me alone.

14:20.084 --> 14:21.961
- Shit.
- Hey, Eggar!

14:22.061 --> 14:25.096
- Come on Eggar!
- Cut your shit out, out here!

14:28.351 --> 14:29.361
Eggar!

14:29.761 --> 14:32.130
Oh, it's beautiful!

14:36.325 --> 14:40.288
Hey, simple! Boats stay on the bus.
How you supposed to get downstream?

14:40.388 --> 14:43.949
Now come on, get down there. We got
a stream to clear. Let's go, let's go.

14:47.145 --> 14:48.945
Pick up that box.

14:51.007 --> 14:53.826
Hey! What you doing?
Just go on, I'll take care of that.

14:53.926 --> 14:55.828
Get that out of here. Go ahead!

14:55.928 --> 14:58.214
- Okay man, why don't you get off my back?
- You keep walking.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.074
- You just keep walking.
- Fool.

15:18.217 --> 15:20.553
Gold, gold!

15:22.588 --> 15:26.408
It's real? Hardly.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.851
Hey, city boy.

15:53.886 --> 15:57.056
Hey, Mike! Why don't you
give these guys a break?

15:58.157 --> 16:00.650
Hey, you guys, take a break. Take 5.

16:11.787 --> 16:14.865
So, tell me. How much dope
they grow around here?

16:21.556 --> 16:23.957
Come on, give me a break!

16:24.575 --> 16:27.220
I bet you guys got plenty of
stuff growing around here.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.630
What, you think the mad Romanian's
going to turn you guys in?

16:29.730 --> 16:33.276
Hey, you Romanian jerk. You start
messing with somebody else's crop

16:33.376 --> 16:36.437
you're going to get your ass blown away.
You think that's funny?

16:36.537 --> 16:39.707
We got too close once, one of them
hippie guys came out with an M16.

16:39.807 --> 16:42.618
Hey city boy.
Want to try some knuckle brew?

16:43.911 --> 16:47.238
- How about some of my stash?
- Naw, give it to Eggar.

16:47.373 --> 16:51.869
- Well, I ain't got no brain cells.
- He can't get high.

16:55.298 --> 16:57.950
You little peckers keep
up that horse shit

16:58.050 --> 17:00.085
and I'm going to strand
your butts out there.

17:00.987 --> 17:03.463
I remember a wise ass
butt just like you, Zorich.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.459
And he was pestering
like y'all been doing.

17:06.659 --> 17:10.454
One night I took him.
Way up there in the hills.

17:10.554 --> 17:13.890
And I tied him down so
nobody could find him.

17:14.483 --> 17:17.644
Because I about had
it with his horse shit.

17:19.321 --> 17:21.439
And I left him there.

17:23.058 --> 17:25.568
And ain't nobody ever found him since.

17:27.195 --> 17:28.314
Y'all hear me now?

17:30.133 --> 17:31.734
You all hear me now?

17:36.756 --> 17:39.242
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

17:39.342 --> 17:43.044
Don't ever come back!
Don't ever come back!

17:47.433 --> 17:50.503
Oh, Mike, they told me
that one in kindergarten.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.572
Okay, Boone. It's your turn.

17:52.672 --> 17:55.016
- Come on, your turn.
- Oh, come on Rich!

17:55.116 --> 17:57.301
Tell it, go on man. Go ahead.

17:57.401 --> 17:59.879
- You don't have to be bashful.
- Come on, Boone.

18:00.679 --> 18:02.347
I'll get the wood.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.278
Okay.

18:09.789 --> 18:14.485
So once upon a time, not too long ago,

18:15.962 --> 18:19.456
this used to be a logging camp,
right here.

18:20.607 --> 18:26.188
There was this little sweet 14 year old
girl who lived here with a big family.

18:26.898 --> 18:30.794
And her father died. So her uncle
came to take care of the place.

18:31.294 --> 18:33.045
And he was a lumberjack.

18:33.145 --> 18:37.324
And he was a mean son
of a bitch. Mean, boy.

18:40.186 --> 18:43.491
And one night this uncle said,

18:44.599 --> 18:50.020
"Hey Susie Q, you want to go
for a little walk in the woods?"

18:51.555 --> 18:56.311
So he took her on one of these trails,
here. Way far out, you know, like we are.

18:57.611 --> 18:59.529
And he raped her.

19:00.314 --> 19:02.574
She screamed but nobody could hear her.

19:04.927 --> 19:07.914
She had to keep all this
inside after the rape.

19:08.014 --> 19:11.536
Because she couldn't tell anybody because,
you know, he was supporting the family.

19:11.636 --> 19:16.139
She was afraid to.
So she started going crazy.

19:16.639 --> 19:20.343
So what they done is,
they put her in a mental institution.

19:20.643 --> 19:23.536
You know that one we
passed on the way down here?

19:23.696 --> 19:28.149
And while she's in the hospital
they find out that she's pregnant.

19:30.177 --> 19:33.514
So she has this little baby boy.
But the doctor says,

19:33.614 --> 19:36.609
"Well, she's too messed up
to take care of the kid."

19:36.809 --> 19:39.077
So they take the baby away from her.

19:39.587 --> 19:42.135
Okay, so 19 years later...

19:43.420 --> 19:48.169
this young kid, just about my age,
shows up down there at the hospital.

19:50.089 --> 19:52.257
He wants to see this lady.

19:52.758 --> 19:54.876
So they let him in.

19:55.394 --> 19:59.548
And he goes crazy.
I mean he just freaks out.

19:59.648 --> 20:03.844
He says, "You can't treat my Mama like this,
you can't keep her in this garbage can!"

20:03.944 --> 20:08.640
It was her son. He just stole her
right out of the place. Just took her.

20:10.067 --> 20:13.111
But she was so crazy, you know,

20:13.287 --> 20:17.740
that he didn't know what to do with her.
So he put her out here in these woods

20:18.000 --> 20:20.377
so she could live in peace, you know.

20:21.187 --> 20:25.915
But the story goes that whenever
anybody camps out around here,

20:26.959 --> 20:29.551
she sneaks into your camp...

20:30.381 --> 20:33.487
and she whispers to you.
She bends down over you,

20:33.587 --> 20:37.280
man, you can just smell her breathing
on you. You can feel it. And she says,

20:38.644 --> 20:42.925
"Who stole my lamb?"

20:43.725 --> 20:46.086
"Who stole my..."

21:02.019 --> 21:04.196
What the hell you telling
stories like that for, boy?

21:04.296 --> 21:06.699
What the hell you doing like that?

21:06.799 --> 21:09.884
- Scaring these girls half to death!
- Eggar, it ain't your turn.

21:10.803 --> 21:12.488
You think that's funny?

21:12.788 --> 21:15.767
- Eggar!
- I ought to cut your tongue out.

21:16.267 --> 21:18.676
- You shit!
- Hey, Eggar.

21:19.562 --> 21:23.424
I want to talk to you. Privately.

21:23.524 --> 21:27.386
Don't need to talk about anything.
Get your stuff ready. I'm leaving now.

21:27.486 --> 21:32.231
Fine. Just be sure you get the boats
there when they're supposed to be.

21:33.451 --> 21:35.394
Let's get everything on
the bus that's going on it.

21:35.494 --> 21:38.154
- It's leaving now.
- Where's my hat?

21:39.181 --> 21:40.361
We'll be rid of him.

21:51.760 --> 21:55.089
This guy in my neighborhood made a
fortune one week off of some smoke

21:55.189 --> 21:56.916
he bought from a farmer up here.

21:57.016 --> 21:59.734
We don't buy grass here.
We pull it out of the ground.

21:59.868 --> 22:02.988
The only reason you're coming is
because Boone's hot for that chick.

22:05.774 --> 22:07.725
It's about time!

22:08.369 --> 22:11.505
What took you so damn long?
It's freezing up here!

22:13.741 --> 22:15.100
Cerone.

22:17.403 --> 22:20.439
- Where the hell is Boone?
- He's got lady plans tonight.

22:20.539 --> 22:23.526
What the hell you bring him for?
I don't know him from Adam.

22:23.626 --> 22:26.862
- What do you need to know?
- Man, it's what you need to know.

22:28.280 --> 22:31.283
Stealing weed ain't like taking
candy from a grocery store.

22:31.383 --> 22:32.476
Hey, where do you think I come from man?

22:32.576 --> 22:34.620
- I don't care where you come from!
- Shut up!

22:34.720 --> 22:36.555
I deal with this stuff on the
streets all the time, man.

22:36.655 --> 22:38.499
- Shut up!
- I don't know this guy!

22:38.599 --> 22:41.510
Nathaniel, how's this?

22:41.610 --> 22:47.557
He can be our lookout. We need someone
to cover our ass. Remember last time?

22:49.835 --> 22:51.261
All right, all right.

22:54.415 --> 22:55.815
All right.

22:57.051 --> 23:02.156
You cover our ass tonight,
you do a good job of it,

23:02.556 --> 23:05.825
we'll cut you in for 20 percent.

23:13.217 --> 23:14.243
A third.

23:14.443 --> 23:17.354
- Kiss my...
- Nathaniel, Nathaniel just hold on.

23:18.639 --> 23:20.048
20 percent.

23:21.642 --> 23:23.611
- Fuck you.
- Hey, wait a minute.

23:23.811 --> 23:26.680
Nathaniel, give me 10 minutes with him.

23:31.902 --> 23:33.761
I'm relying on you.

23:40.494 --> 23:43.814
All right, a third.

23:43.914 --> 23:46.115
This is the way we do it.

23:47.334 --> 23:51.363
I want you to stay here
unless somebody comes.

23:51.463 --> 23:54.682
I want you to howl like
a wolf every 45 seconds.

23:55.634 --> 24:00.831
Wait, I know it sounds crazy. I done
it myself before, but it's fool proof.

24:00.931 --> 24:03.334
Why don't I howl when
I do spot somebody?

24:03.434 --> 24:06.012
You mean to tell me,
cracker come up to you,

24:06.112 --> 24:08.122
stick a M16 up your asshole,
you're going to say,

24:08.222 --> 24:11.808
"Excuse me, sir, I got to
howl like a wolf now?"

24:12.668 --> 24:14.519
Use your head.

24:15.404 --> 24:20.783
It's when the howling stops
that we know someone's coming.

24:24.112 --> 24:25.613
Okay.

24:26.932 --> 24:28.025
Howl.

24:28.125 --> 24:30.376
Like a wolf? A howl?

24:35.924 --> 24:41.080
You mean that's all you can do for a third,
you can't do better than that?

24:47.419 --> 24:49.672
You like that? Good.

24:49.772 --> 24:52.424
Now, don't you let up until we get back.

24:52.524 --> 24:55.378
- How long am I supposed to do this?
- A couple hours.

24:55.478 --> 24:58.855
You got to remember. You're special.

24:59.198 --> 25:02.567
We never let nobody in
for a third before, ever.

25:06.930 --> 25:08.597
Hey, Zorich?

25:09.433 --> 25:11.525
You're a real generous guy.

25:12.144 --> 25:14.087
You just keep howling.

25:21.812 --> 25:23.706
- Did he take the bait?
- You kidding?

25:23.806 --> 25:26.000
Cerone is dumber than I thought he was.

27:08.786 --> 27:11.445
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

27:11.705 --> 27:14.217
- Rise and shine.
- No.

27:14.317 --> 27:15.817
Yes.

27:16.652 --> 27:20.296
- We have to set an example.
- What time is it?

27:20.714 --> 27:26.293
It's late. Look, you go get the
guys and I'll go get the girls.

27:30.991 --> 27:32.466
Hey, you guys!

27:34.620 --> 27:36.303
Get up!

27:36.980 --> 27:38.132
Come on girls!

27:39.233 --> 27:40.808
Come on!

27:43.904 --> 27:48.225
Let's go, wake up. Come on. Come on girls,
let's wake up. Let's go, come on.

27:48.325 --> 27:49.818
- Hey, Vanessa.
- Stop it!

27:49.918 --> 27:52.563
Good heavens Melanie, take it easy.

27:52.663 --> 27:55.823
- Come on Windy.
- I didn't sleep a wink.

28:00.988 --> 28:03.539
Hey, come on you guys, get up.

28:04.733 --> 28:07.668
Dennis. Come on, get up man.

28:08.570 --> 28:11.039
Hey, Nathaniel, rise and shine.

28:11.139 --> 28:12.833
- Rise and shine.
- Rise and shine.

28:12.933 --> 28:14.268
Rise and shine.

28:14.368 --> 28:15.753
- Get up!
- Don't!

28:15.853 --> 28:21.459
Hey asshole, get up. Looks like Marco
Cerone beat all you guys to the latrine.

28:21.859 --> 28:23.719
Go bring one of them girls over here.

28:25.019 --> 28:27.639
Come on, get up.
Breakfast is almost ready.

28:29.424 --> 28:30.851
What year is this?

28:31.451 --> 28:34.396
Hey, greenie, Windy, come on let's go.

28:41.219 --> 28:42.578
Night.

28:43.130 --> 28:45.148
I should have slept
over there last night.

28:50.971 --> 28:53.440
Hey, watch what you're doing
you almost hit my foot.

28:53.540 --> 28:54.715
Quiet!

28:57.336 --> 29:02.640
1, 2, 3, Marco!

29:04.092 --> 29:06.386
You guys didn't hear him
around at all this morning?

29:06.486 --> 29:08.639
I didn't hear a single thing.

29:08.739 --> 29:12.051
Wonder where he wandered off to.
You'd think he'd show up for breakfast.

29:12.451 --> 29:13.701
Guy's a lone wolf.

29:15.537 --> 29:18.890
- Meaning what?
- City boy couldn't wait to get in the woods.

29:20.417 --> 29:23.654
- Control yourself.
- He went on a nature hike.

29:23.954 --> 29:26.247
- When?
- Last night.

29:27.165 --> 29:28.466
He's been out all night?

29:29.343 --> 29:31.903
- Well, where'd you leave him?
- Out there.

29:33.513 --> 29:34.498
Shut up.

29:34.598 --> 29:36.792
Why don't we all go home
and forget this trip?

29:36.892 --> 29:38.527
No, no, no.
The first thing we're going to do

29:38.627 --> 29:41.138
is you guys are going to show me
where you left him. All of you!

29:41.238 --> 29:43.624
- He didn't have nothing to do with it.
- You two then.

29:44.624 --> 29:46.175
Move!

29:53.325 --> 29:55.151
Marco!

29:56.295 --> 29:58.546
Hey Marco!

30:00.958 --> 30:03.894
- Marco!
- Marco!

30:05.504 --> 30:07.037
Marco!

30:09.174 --> 30:12.543
We're not going to be able to get on
the river today because of you guys.

30:13.053 --> 30:14.538
Marco!

30:14.638 --> 30:17.598
Hey, Mike, come on,
we didn't mean any harm.

30:21.561 --> 30:23.380
Fun's fun, but not all night.

30:23.480 --> 30:28.309
Man, they did that to me a million times.
They did it to me when I first came.

30:28.768 --> 30:32.855
- Marco!
- Come on, Mike, it ain't that serious.

30:33.907 --> 30:37.285
- Is this it?
- Looks different in daylight.

30:37.385 --> 30:41.280
Bet you he's back at the camp.
Laughing his... butt off.

30:41.757 --> 30:44.058
What the hell is that?

30:54.970 --> 30:57.147
All right, listen you guys.

30:57.247 --> 31:00.417
I want you to go back to camp.
Mark the trail on your way.

31:00.517 --> 31:04.646
Get Mel. Send her out here to me.
You two go downstream, search up.

31:04.746 --> 31:07.674
We'll go upstream, we'll search down.
Okay, come on. Move!

31:07.774 --> 31:09.800
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yes, sir!

31:22.789 --> 31:24.573
Marco?

31:56.990 --> 31:59.275
Mike!

32:09.595 --> 32:11.278
Cerone!

32:14.941 --> 32:17.411
Marco!

32:17.511 --> 32:19.579
Marco!

32:19.679 --> 32:22.315
Marco!

33:10.522 --> 33:12.723
Come on, let's get shaking.

33:12.941 --> 33:16.094
- What you did was really stupid.
- It ain't none of your business, lady!

33:16.194 --> 33:18.905
Well, unfortunately,
we're all on this trip together.

33:19.005 --> 33:22.309
You tell your friend's father to buy you
better company next time, you understand?

33:22.409 --> 33:25.128
- Well, I sure will.
- Lighten up, will you man?

33:25.228 --> 33:28.774
- Get out of my face, you understand me?
- Get up the stream.

33:28.874 --> 33:32.150
Get up the goddamn stream!
You little shit!

33:33.461 --> 33:36.955
Margaret, I think that guy's psychotic.

33:40.510 --> 33:42.795
Goddamn Zorich.

33:54.043 --> 33:55.801
What are you doing here?

33:55.901 --> 33:58.369
- I'm looking for you!
- Are you?

34:07.095 --> 34:09.831
- You didn't see Marco?
- No, you didn't either?

34:09.931 --> 34:13.018
No, I saw this,
and it looked much better.

35:04.139 --> 35:06.163
No.

35:13.392 --> 35:15.030
No.

35:15.230 --> 35:17.381
Marco!

35:18.300 --> 35:22.287
That dude dies because we left him
out there it's negligent homicide, man.

35:22.387 --> 35:25.223
- Bullshit.
- Listen, I know what I'm talking about.

35:25.323 --> 35:28.217
Every time I play one of your
silly games I get in trouble.

35:29.736 --> 35:30.978
Look at that!

35:33.548 --> 35:35.290
Check it out.

35:36.626 --> 35:39.654
- Use hand signals.
- Will you cut the Army crap?

35:39.754 --> 35:42.866
This is private property, bud.
They might not like your kind.

35:42.966 --> 35:44.784
Man, give me a break.

35:52.017 --> 35:55.093
I'm going in. Cover me.

35:56.104 --> 35:58.013
With what?

36:06.681 --> 36:08.565
What's with you, man?

36:16.115 --> 36:17.442
Hey!

36:19.202 --> 36:20.753
Come here.

36:30.305 --> 36:33.208
- It's one of the old camp rafts.
- How did it get there?

36:48.114 --> 36:52.343
- Think somebody's buried there?
- Probably just a dog.

36:52.443 --> 36:53.860
Yeah.

37:58.143 --> 37:59.877
Zorich?

38:07.318 --> 38:08.910
Zorich.

38:12.866 --> 38:14.474
Zorich?

38:17.145 --> 38:18.345
Zorich.

38:20.940 --> 38:22.240
Zoro!

38:26.504 --> 38:28.982
- I'm going to kill you!
- You wouldn't hurt an old lady, would you?

38:29.082 --> 38:30.749
I'm going to kill you!

38:33.845 --> 38:37.589
- Hold it, hold it!
- What the...

38:38.516 --> 38:41.385
Oh, man. What the hell is going on here?

38:57.619 --> 38:59.285
Can you tell?

39:00.271 --> 39:01.673
Mushrooms?

39:01.773 --> 39:05.367
Pure magic. Guaranteed to get you high.

39:06.427 --> 39:07.687
Better than acid.

39:07.787 --> 39:11.949
Some funky mother's been living around
here. Look at all these women's clothes.

39:26.022 --> 39:27.589
I don't believe this.

39:28.216 --> 39:30.927
- Nathaniel.
- What?

39:31.027 --> 39:32.277
It's Eggar!

39:33.446 --> 39:34.889
You think he's got a woman living here?

39:34.989 --> 39:38.266
Ain't no woman living here,
he's a goddamn freak!

39:44.624 --> 39:48.911
That sucker. I told you
he's been stealing from me!

39:50.621 --> 39:53.683
Now we're going to get his ass fired!

39:56.761 --> 39:57.971
Come on, let's go.

39:58.271 --> 40:01.757
Wait a minute. I just want to
see what else he's got around.

40:06.312 --> 40:08.889
He's sicker than I thought he was.

40:11.484 --> 40:14.019
Let's get the hell out of here.

40:30.712 --> 40:33.498
I seen a lot of crazy people in my
life but this freak takes the cake.

40:33.798 --> 40:35.492
You think maybe Cerone
slept there last night?

40:35.592 --> 40:40.462
Cerone slept there?
Man, this cat is sick!

40:41.806 --> 40:44.834
Thing is, you just don't know
what Eggar's doing up here.

40:44.934 --> 40:47.277
Who knows what the
hell we're doing up here.

40:47.904 --> 40:51.306
Look, all we can do is wait.
For Mike and Mel.

40:51.482 --> 40:54.601
They know what they're doing,
I mean, they're probably all right.

40:56.487 --> 40:59.240
They wouldn't have left us up here all
night if there wasn't something wrong.

41:02.452 --> 41:06.996
This is what we're going to do.
First thing, pair up.

41:07.248 --> 41:10.877
- Nobody comes or goes alone anymore.
- Now you're concerned?

41:10.977 --> 41:12.529
You don't know what
you're dealing with, lady.

41:12.629 --> 41:14.972
Come on! Go keep watch.

41:18.468 --> 41:20.627
Wake me up when you get tired.

42:14.114 --> 42:17.267
Shit! Dammit!

42:18.611 --> 42:20.847
What's the screaming about?
What's going on?

42:20.947 --> 42:23.591
There's somebody here.
There's someone around.

42:23.991 --> 42:27.312
I smelled this smell.
There was this smell.

42:27.412 --> 42:31.627
And there was these hands, these hands
in my hair. I swear I'm not dreaming,

42:31.727 --> 42:35.744
- I'm not dreaming there's somebody!
- It's okay, listen to me. It's okay.

42:36.045 --> 42:40.424
- I thought you were on guard.
- I was. I heard a noise, Eggar maybe.

42:40.842 --> 42:44.002
Fell in the damn creek
and sprained my wrist.

42:47.598 --> 42:51.676
This all started because you
played that stupid prank on Cerone.

42:52.462 --> 42:53.729
Light up a joint.

42:56.265 --> 42:57.958
Is it dry?

43:09.287 --> 43:11.554
Windy, give me the axe.

43:20.265 --> 43:21.690
What the hell was that?

43:26.028 --> 43:27.721
Who is it?

43:28.890 --> 43:31.450
Good evening gentlemen.

43:33.820 --> 43:35.255
You turkey.

43:37.090 --> 43:39.015
It's Cerone!

43:41.319 --> 43:43.137
- Scared the shit out of me.
- Hey, Cerone.

43:43.237 --> 43:46.014
- Where've you been?
- That was great Cerone.

43:46.766 --> 43:49.075
Ain't as dumb as you thought,
is he Zorich?

43:55.541 --> 43:57.067
Anybody want to get high?

43:58.002 --> 43:59.636
Do we still get a third?

44:01.330 --> 44:03.599
Did you see Mike or Mel
out there anywhere?

44:04.650 --> 44:06.127
No, they're not around?

44:06.427 --> 44:08.329
They're not here because
they thought you were lost

44:08.429 --> 44:10.330
and went looking for you this morning.

44:11.974 --> 44:15.527
- I wasn't lost. I been all over.
- Where?

44:18.397 --> 44:19.465
Around.

44:19.565 --> 44:24.529
Oh, great. We have Romeo and
Juliet lost in the woods somewhere.

44:24.629 --> 44:28.908
A driver who's an absolute lunatic.
A quite unnecessarily broken wrist.

44:29.008 --> 44:34.116
I mean, what is wrong with you people?
Our trip is a complete disaster

44:34.216 --> 44:38.234
and we're playing childish games
and stupid juvenile pranks!

44:38.334 --> 44:40.853
If you were trying to scare us,
you succeeded.

44:40.953 --> 44:45.015
Congratulations. Now, perhaps,
you'll concentrate on growing up.

44:46.467 --> 44:49.295
- Where do you think you're going?
- The outhouse, if it's any of your concern.

44:49.395 --> 44:52.906
- Not alone you're not.
- Don't give me orders!

45:51.282 --> 45:53.066
Vanessa, come on!

45:54.827 --> 45:55.770
Come on!

45:59.332 --> 46:01.234
All right, you're all right,
you're all right!

46:15.848 --> 46:18.174
Oh, my God, it's Mike.

46:19.243 --> 46:20.977
- No!
- No!

46:22.404 --> 46:23.881
What is it?

46:23.981 --> 46:25.732
Oh, don't look, don't look!

46:51.676 --> 46:55.136
- We have to find Melanie.
- She's right.

46:57.006 --> 46:59.250
May be too late but we got to find out.

46:59.350 --> 47:02.455
Where I come from, you learn not to
mess around with something like this.

47:02.555 --> 47:05.965
It's out of our hands. We should get
out of here on the road we came in on.

47:06.065 --> 47:09.394
45 miles? That's a two day hike.

47:09.494 --> 47:12.005
You try something like that on open
road and you're a sitting duck.

47:12.105 --> 47:14.015
What do you suggest we do then?

47:14.215 --> 47:17.143
I suggest we stay right here.
At least for the night.

47:17.243 --> 47:19.845
In the morning we'll head
down by the river.

47:19.945 --> 47:22.105
From there it's only
six miles to the ocean.

47:23.332 --> 47:25.693
I don't need this bullshit.

47:25.793 --> 47:28.553
Tomorrow morning, dawn,
we hit that house quick.

47:29.630 --> 47:34.001
Maybe if we're lucky we'll
find Eggar fast asleep.

47:34.101 --> 47:37.422
You better stop that
bullshit about revenge Zorich!

47:37.522 --> 47:40.166
We don't all want to
play your little war game!

47:40.266 --> 47:42.418
We don't want to play
cowboys and Indians!

47:42.518 --> 47:46.771
- We want to get out of here!
- Please, please stop it!

47:47.857 --> 47:51.384
- Just stop it, stop!
- Listen to me.

47:51.494 --> 47:53.846
You people want to survive this thing

47:53.946 --> 47:58.433
you got to start looking
and thinking like the forest.

48:02.755 --> 48:07.026
You tie those beads back, you understand?
Blondie, you get that hair under a cap.

48:07.126 --> 48:09.978
And Boone, get off that white shirt.

49:42.905 --> 49:44.722
Eggar!

49:46.509 --> 49:48.560
Get your ass out here!

49:53.299 --> 49:55.099
Eggar!

49:57.544 --> 50:00.237
We coming to get you man!

50:54.343 --> 50:57.203
Guys, what's going on in there?

51:00.466 --> 51:02.166
God.

51:38.420 --> 51:40.398
There any of Mel's things in here?

51:41.298 --> 51:44.768
- Oh, my God!
- I'm going to kill that bastard.

51:45.552 --> 51:48.313
- We can't leave without Melanie.
- I'm going to kill him.

51:48.413 --> 51:52.633
Come on Windy.
Don't stay in here. Windy!

51:53.977 --> 51:57.889
Let's get the hell out of here.
Let's get down by the river.

51:59.817 --> 52:01.809
I'm going to kill him.

52:13.606 --> 52:15.331
Let's go!

52:19.795 --> 52:23.424
Let's burn this sucker.
Burn this whole thing down right now.

52:23.524 --> 52:25.843
No! We got to show them
what Eggar did here.

52:25.943 --> 52:30.171
We stick together, get the hell out
of here and let the cops handle it.

53:45.714 --> 53:47.074
This one?

53:47.174 --> 53:49.500
- Take mine.
- Take that one.

53:53.972 --> 53:56.591
Make sure you got something warm on.

54:04.525 --> 54:08.853
- Hey, I hope you guys realize I can't swim.
- Don't worry, sit by me.

54:34.138 --> 54:37.465
Keep your eyes open, no more surprises.

54:42.104 --> 54:43.721
Even!

55:09.631 --> 55:11.323
Watch the edge.

56:01.517 --> 56:04.795
Hey, Boone, give me the canteen.
Anybody want any water?

56:04.895 --> 56:06.846
I'll have some.

56:56.572 --> 56:58.355
Melanie!

57:00.075 --> 57:01.492
You're dead Eggar!

57:05.906 --> 57:07.698
Eggar!

57:10.919 --> 57:12.361
Come back Zorich!

57:13.338 --> 57:14.789
Dammit!

57:39.339 --> 57:40.806
Enough already.

58:02.679 --> 58:06.274
Faster goddammit, move it!

58:07.826 --> 58:10.629
Come on, come on, come on.

58:10.729 --> 58:13.840
We got it, we got it,
we got it, come on.

58:13.940 --> 58:19.888
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

58:20.188 --> 58:21.924
- Wait!
- Easy, jump in. Easy.

58:22.024 --> 58:23.757
Here Vanessa.

58:25.118 --> 58:27.620
- Okay, let's go.
- Get off the raft!

58:30.123 --> 58:33.935
- You get out of that boat!
- Zorich, don't be hollering at her no more!

58:34.928 --> 58:36.977
We got you, we got you.
Come on, be cool.

58:37.077 --> 58:39.206
- Vanessa!
- Relax, relax!

58:39.466 --> 58:41.293
- Shit!
- Only 3 feet, lady.

58:41.393 --> 58:44.837
- Shut up!
- I've had enough of you Zorich!

59:09.805 --> 59:12.941
- How could he do all this?
- I don't know, man.

59:13.041 --> 59:17.202
But I know if we can get that thing
started we can get our butts out of here.

59:18.547 --> 59:20.488
It's a trap.

59:21.299 --> 59:23.459
We'll stay here til dark.

59:43.071 --> 59:46.315
- Be careful Boone!
- Windy be quiet!

59:50.954 --> 59:52.988
Come on, Eggar.

59:58.670 --> 01:00:01.580
Come on, Eggar, I know you're on here.

01:00:03.008 --> 01:00:05.692
Be careful. Stay back.

01:00:06.136 --> 01:00:09.680
Come on, Eggar, come on out.

01:00:11.975 --> 01:00:13.676
Come on, Eggar.

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:15.727
What you see?

01:00:44.341 --> 01:00:45.674
He's not here.

01:00:46.176 --> 01:00:47.793
Come on in.

01:00:51.389 --> 01:00:53.882
All right, our stuff is still here.

01:01:08.532 --> 01:01:11.435
Where the hell is he?
I know he's here somewhere.

01:01:11.535 --> 01:01:13.619
Zorich, is there any keys up there?

01:01:16.831 --> 01:01:19.593
Yeah. No juice.

01:01:19.693 --> 01:01:24.138
Well we going to start this mother anyway.
Come on, let's check under the hood.

01:01:27.759 --> 01:01:29.244
Check the battery.

01:01:29.344 --> 01:01:32.296
- The wire's cut.
- Here.

01:01:35.392 --> 01:01:38.545
Marshmallows, chocolate.

01:01:38.645 --> 01:01:42.381
- Check against the back, there.
- I done did, it ain't here.

01:01:42.566 --> 01:01:44.099
Shit.

01:01:49.739 --> 01:01:53.484
This bus ain't going nowhere.
Eggar took care of that.

01:01:54.369 --> 01:01:56.245
Then we sure shouldn't stay here.

01:01:57.272 --> 01:01:59.983
And what we going to do Windy?
Go down the river at night?

01:02:00.083 --> 01:02:02.761
- What we going to do is stay here til sunrise.
- Not so bad.

01:02:02.861 --> 01:02:05.989
There's some dry clothes and there's
some food in the cooler back there.

01:02:06.089 --> 01:02:09.625
- I'll eat anything.
- Come on, Windy, light up a joint.

01:02:12.262 --> 01:02:15.172
- Want an orange?
- I'll take a piece of fruit.

01:03:05.148 --> 01:03:07.816
I told them not to come.

01:04:23.893 --> 01:04:27.172
- Pull, darn it!
- Pull on it!

01:04:27.272 --> 01:04:30.433
- Get out of the way, I'll kick the door open!
- Kick it Marco!

01:04:31.443 --> 01:04:33.360
Get out the back!

01:04:34.521 --> 01:04:35.721
Eggar!

01:04:36.406 --> 01:04:37.786
Eggar!

01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:39.413
Eggar!

01:04:40.952 --> 01:04:42.437
Leave them alone!

01:04:42.537 --> 01:04:44.439
- It's stuck!
- Break the goddamn thing!

01:04:44.539 --> 01:04:46.191
Don't push me!

01:04:46.291 --> 01:04:48.033
Come on, let's go!

01:04:50.545 --> 01:04:53.581
I'm stuck! I'm fucking stuck!

01:04:56.926 --> 01:04:58.910
Come on, Zorich!

01:05:06.361 --> 01:05:07.504
Where do I go?

01:05:07.604 --> 01:05:10.138
All right, keep going!
Stay together, keep running!

01:05:10.315 --> 01:05:12.968
- Where we running to?
- Just keep going!

01:05:13.068 --> 01:05:14.969
I don't know, just keep running!

01:05:15.845 --> 01:05:17.996
I can't see a thing!

01:05:24.329 --> 01:05:25.854
Come on, lady!

01:05:46.142 --> 01:05:50.304
Zorich! Zorich, wait up!

01:05:58.655 --> 01:06:00.314
Zorich?

01:06:03.151 --> 01:06:04.893
Boone?

01:06:09.749 --> 01:06:13.428
- Just got to find a way out of here.
- Find a way out of here, I'll be fine.

01:06:15.238 --> 01:06:17.205
Zorich!

01:06:20.635 --> 01:06:22.669
Margaret!

01:06:27.776 --> 01:06:29.343
Vanessa?

01:06:29.970 --> 01:06:33.096
Goddamn it Zorich, why'd you
let her out of your sight?

01:06:35.775 --> 01:06:37.259
Windy!

01:06:40.747 --> 01:06:42.096
Windy!

01:06:43.116 --> 01:06:44.204
Windy!

01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:51.148
Windy!

01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:56.853
Windy!

01:06:58.164 --> 01:06:59.245
Windy!

01:06:59.883 --> 01:07:02.952
It's okay, we're here.
It's okay, it's okay.

01:07:03.178 --> 01:07:06.097
- Where'd he go?
- It's okay, we're here, it's okay.

01:07:13.404 --> 01:07:16.265
I'm going to have to stop the bleeding.
I'll need something to sew her up with.

01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:18.318
Here.

01:07:21.196 --> 01:07:22.421
And quickly.

01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:25.275
There's a first aid kit at the bus,
we're going to have to go back.

01:07:25.775 --> 01:07:26.818
I'll go.

01:07:27.118 --> 01:07:31.279
Hines, you stay with us. Zorich, you go.

01:07:31.706 --> 01:07:34.366
It's okay Windy, it's okay.

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:44.543
It's okay, Windy, it's okay.
We're right here.

01:07:44.728 --> 01:07:47.037
Windy, it's going to be okay.

01:07:55.313 --> 01:07:57.731
Come on, you guys, hurry please!

01:08:13.998 --> 01:08:16.198
Come on, let's go!

01:08:28.595 --> 01:08:31.805
There, there. You're going to be okay.

01:08:31.906 --> 01:08:34.959
You're going to be okay.
It's going to be all right.

01:08:37.814 --> 01:08:40.865
Come on, just relax.
Margaret knows what she's doing.

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:49.033
There, hold on, hold on.
That's good, that's good, that's good.

01:08:49.133 --> 01:08:51.352
It's going to be okay.
It's going to be okay.

01:08:51.452 --> 01:08:53.944
- Doing good.
- It's all over, it's all over.

01:08:56.741 --> 01:08:58.017
Eggar's the enemy.

01:08:59.277 --> 01:09:01.412
Our job is to kill him.

01:09:07.527 --> 01:09:09.794
Eggar should die.

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:16.551
Zorich.

01:09:17.185 --> 01:09:20.054
There's too much room
up here to trap him.

01:09:20.765 --> 01:09:24.350
If we get him down in the
ravine it'll be nice and close.

01:09:51.261 --> 01:09:55.382
Cut the song Zorich. Crazy bastard.

01:10:04.917 --> 01:10:08.421
Easy now, take it easy now. You okay?

01:10:16.496 --> 01:10:18.572
Y'all watch your step.

01:10:58.162 --> 01:10:59.471
Zorich, shut up.

01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:26.097
Okay, this is great.
This is where we're going to do it.

01:11:41.122 --> 01:11:44.625
Great. This is great.

01:11:58.273 --> 01:11:59.756
Come here!

01:12:00.349 --> 01:12:02.350
Found something!

01:12:32.298 --> 01:12:36.409
I'm going to kill him. Right here.

01:12:37.678 --> 01:12:40.288
This is where it's going to happen.

01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:42.548
Beautiful.

01:12:43.242 --> 01:12:45.744
This is beautiful, ain't it?

01:12:46.604 --> 01:12:48.896
You know something?

01:12:49.181 --> 01:12:53.134
Throughout all this, I respect him.

01:12:54.654 --> 01:12:59.308
He's just quiet, waiting.

01:12:59.508 --> 01:13:03.937
That's the reason we lost the war.
You know that, don't you?

01:13:04.288 --> 01:13:06.931
Well, the VC knew that.

01:13:07.458 --> 01:13:09.367
They did.

01:13:10.127 --> 01:13:13.839
- They knew about the forest.
- You took them mushrooms, didn't you?

01:13:16.751 --> 01:13:20.754
We found some magic mushrooms in
the shack. He's stoned out his mind.

01:13:21.281 --> 01:13:22.498
Damn you!

01:13:22.598 --> 01:13:27.210
- Hey, man, it's a war game!
- Then get your act together!

01:13:28.779 --> 01:13:31.147
Blond hair bitch.

01:13:31.607 --> 01:13:33.301
You keep off my ass!

01:13:33.401 --> 01:13:36.561
Zorich, goddammit! We need your help.

01:13:36.696 --> 01:13:38.189
You're damn right you do.

01:13:38.289 --> 01:13:41.649
Okay, good Zorich.
You do your thing, okay?

01:13:42.768 --> 01:13:47.188
And we'll do ours. Leave him alone.
Come on, let's go.

01:13:48.499 --> 01:13:50.108
Chump.

01:13:50.318 --> 01:13:54.579
Goddamn. I ain't stoned.

01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:46.130
- How you doing?
- Okay.

01:15:12.458 --> 01:15:17.287
Hey, Cerone!
Nobody's keeping your ass here!

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:07.120
Eggar!

01:16:13.953 --> 01:16:15.628
Eggar!

01:16:20.359 --> 01:16:21.968
Eggar!

01:16:26.882 --> 01:16:28.799
Eggar!

01:16:39.003 --> 01:16:41.228
Listen to me Eggar!

01:16:45.076 --> 01:16:47.385
They're going to get you Eggar!

01:16:51.349 --> 01:16:53.916
They're going to get you bad Eggar!

01:16:57.421 --> 01:17:01.182
I don't give a damn Eggar!
I just want to get out of here!

01:17:03.869 --> 01:17:06.212
Eggar, I want to help you!

01:17:19.919 --> 01:17:22.795
Damn you Eggar, show yourself.

01:17:27.810 --> 01:17:31.521
- Where are you Eggar...
- You say too much!

01:17:33.432 --> 01:17:38.295
I told you not to come! But now you
done it. They're going to take her away.

01:17:38.395 --> 01:17:42.890
They're going to take away.
Why'd you come? Why'd you come?

01:17:46.987 --> 01:17:48.963
Now!

01:19:01.195 --> 01:19:03.238
