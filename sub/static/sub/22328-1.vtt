01:21.041 --> 01:22.291
Ah shit...

21:22.916 --> 21:27.708
No. You must not put that on him now.

23:28.166 --> 23:30.708
Yes! Fits you perfect.

23:44.875 --> 23:47.291
You look like my father.

23:53.416 --> 23:55.833
You look like my father.

23:57.125 --> 23:58.625
Father?

23:59.291 --> 24:00.750
Yes.

24:12.250 --> 24:13.708
Yes.

31:01.833 --> 31:02.791
Quiet!

31:17.833 --> 31:27.333
The man became consumed with revenge.

31:28.541 --> 31:38.375
He let his mother be carried
to sea by the whale.

31:40.375 --> 31:49.708
But the mother's hair became twisted
into a tusk, as she turned into a narwhal.

31:58.833 --> 32:00.125
That's his mother.

32:00.666 --> 32:02.791
Yes.

32:03.333 --> 32:07.375
The circles of revenge form a chain.

32:07.375 --> 32:10.166
His revenge didn't make him happy.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.208
You can only break the circles
of revenge with forgiveness.

33:26.041 --> 33:27.958
I haven't eaten since yesterday.

33:42.666 --> 33:44.166
Get her something to eat.

33:44.166 --> 33:44.916
Okay.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.041
Sokanon. He's going to lead you
into trouble.

48:25.041 --> 48:27.000
What you're doing is no safer.

48:27.000 --> 48:30.333
But it might stop another village
from being raided.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.583
I have sworn to my sister that
I'd protect Harp.

48:33.583 --> 48:38.791
Your sister is the reason you should not
be going off with this white boy.

48:39.875 --> 48:44.541
The trade is here to stay, Omaciw.
They can't be the only ones to benefit.

48:45.666 --> 48:48.916
Our young girls, not even ten years old,
are being sold off as slaves.

48:48.916 --> 48:51.416
Having to lie with fat old white men
against their will.

48:51.708 --> 48:54.166
If we can save them, shouldn't we?

48:55.291 --> 49:02.041
Sokanon, you follow Harp like a dumb blind girl.
But where is he now?

50:05.875 --> 50:07.208
Who is there?

50:41.708 --> 50:43.708
Where is Declan Harp?
