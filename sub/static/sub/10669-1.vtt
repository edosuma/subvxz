00:34.295 --> 00:35.620
Come on, people!

00:35.644 --> 00:37.665
The clock is ticking!

00:37.689 --> 00:41.887
So Brooke, this is our
Friday night special?

00:41.911 --> 00:43.579
I thought a little
prosciutto would compliment

00:43.591 --> 00:45.271
the shrimp and the
sun-dried tomatoes.

00:45.295 --> 00:46.384
Hm...

00:49.484 --> 00:51.790
Black olive tapenade.

00:53.966 --> 00:55.988
That's a bold move
on a dish like this.

00:56.012 --> 00:57.753
It was just a taste.

01:01.235 --> 01:03.691
It's too busy. You hate it.

01:03.715 --> 01:06.781
I hate that you've made
something more interesting

01:06.805 --> 01:09.523
than anything we've had on the
specials in the last four months.

01:09.547 --> 01:10.940
You're my new sous chef.

01:12.289 --> 01:15.814
It's a creme brulee,
not a French...

01:22.691 --> 01:24.538
Oh, you got my text.

01:24.562 --> 01:25.887
Thank you for the heads up.

01:25.911 --> 01:27.150
Is that for me?

01:27.174 --> 01:29.326
Connie, what would Larry say?

01:29.350 --> 01:30.892
If that was from Buttery Bakery,

01:30.916 --> 01:32.546
he'd thank you with
his mouth full.

01:32.570 --> 01:34.679
She's at the bar.

01:34.703 --> 01:37.029
She's gonna love it.

01:37.053 --> 01:39.186
- Go get 'er, tiger.
- Thanks, Connie.

01:44.582 --> 01:46.169
New Zealand...

01:46.193 --> 01:47.672
Looks like you have a fan club.

01:49.065 --> 01:50.347
Congrats, baby.

01:50.371 --> 01:52.175
Lance! Hey.

01:52.199 --> 01:53.828
Oh, my god. How did you know?

01:53.852 --> 01:55.265
- Connie.
- Yeah...

01:55.289 --> 01:56.440
well don't party too hard.

01:56.464 --> 01:57.789
You have a big night tomorrow.

01:57.813 --> 01:59.182
I'm looking forward to it.

01:59.206 --> 02:01.227
- Thanks, Chef.
- Yeah, don't thank me yet.

02:01.251 --> 02:03.166
My right hand is the
one I usually burn.

02:04.428 --> 02:06.145
Bye, Marco.

02:06.169 --> 02:08.452
Oh, flowers!

02:08.476 --> 02:10.976
But it's not even our
two year anniversary.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.088
It has been one week since
you moved in, though.

02:12.100 --> 02:13.200
Mm.

02:13.224 --> 02:15.589
And a salted caramel cake?

02:15.613 --> 02:17.113
That's my favorite.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.724
Not bad, Mr. Boston.

02:19.748 --> 02:22.248
I am really proud of you.

02:22.272 --> 02:23.404
Thanks, baby.

02:26.849 --> 02:28.689
All right, a beer for me,
and a shot of tequila

02:28.713 --> 02:30.169
for the sexy top chef.

02:30.193 --> 02:31.692
What are you doing?

02:31.716 --> 02:32.824
Celebrating your promotion.

02:32.848 --> 02:34.347
Come on.

02:34.371 --> 02:36.958
Well in that case, make
it two shots of tequila.

02:36.982 --> 02:38.438
Okay.

02:38.462 --> 02:41.528
What? Now that you're here,
I'm not driving home.

02:41.552 --> 02:44.531
To your promotion
and to one week

02:44.555 --> 02:45.915
of living together
without a fight.

02:48.516 --> 02:51.258
Let's enjoy it while it lasts.

02:53.695 --> 02:56.761
- And your second celebration shot.
- Oh, I'll grab it.

02:56.785 --> 03:00.156
This one's to allhe amazing
food you're gonna cook for me.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.268
Okay.

03:04.488 --> 03:06.771
I can't believe I
almost forgot my cake.

03:06.795 --> 03:08.164
Your cake?

03:08.188 --> 03:09.508
You're not gonna
share it with me?

03:11.103 --> 03:13.143
Okay, I thought we agreed
when we moved in together,

03:13.167 --> 03:14.387
everything would be 50/50.

03:14.411 --> 03:16.571
Uh, except for when you bring
home salted caramel cake.

03:16.595 --> 03:17.782
Then it's a 70/30 split.

03:17.806 --> 03:19.827
Oh, okay. I see how it is.

03:19.851 --> 03:21.394
Not cool.

03:21.418 --> 03:22.767
Very cool!

03:24.987 --> 03:28.208
♪ Some people want to have
their cake and eat it too ♪

03:30.949 --> 03:34.059
♪ And after I take my bite
I give the rest to you ♪

03:34.083 --> 03:35.626
How's the paper coming along?

03:35.650 --> 03:37.802
Still got a ways to go.

03:37.826 --> 03:39.282
But good news is, it
looks like we're getting

03:39.306 --> 03:40.626
another grant from
the university,

03:40.650 --> 03:41.806
so I'll have more time.

03:41.830 --> 03:43.590
- How much?
- I don't know.

03:43.614 --> 03:45.288
$20,000 I think.

03:45.312 --> 03:46.506
Nice.

03:46.530 --> 03:48.595
That should buy you some time.

03:48.619 --> 03:50.339
Yeah, but as much as I
enjoy the sabbatical,

03:50.363 --> 03:51.772
I miss the students.

03:51.796 --> 03:53.596
It'll be nice when I can
get back to teaching.

03:53.620 --> 03:55.950
Or you know, we could just...

03:55.974 --> 03:59.040
get married now and
start having kids?

03:59.064 --> 04:00.912
Um...

04:00.936 --> 04:02.914
I just got promoted.

04:02.938 --> 04:05.395
Are you gonna be a
stay-at-home dad?

04:05.419 --> 04:07.484
- I could learn to lactate.
- All right.

04:07.508 --> 04:09.074
Here.

04:10.946 --> 04:13.165
Lance!

06:37.875 --> 06:40.114
Lance! Lance!

06:40.138 --> 06:43.030
- Take it easy, Ms. Harmon.
- Lance is going to be okay.

06:43.054 --> 06:45.206
You're in the hospital,
but everything is okay.

06:45.230 --> 06:46.947
Where is he? I wanna see him.

06:46.971 --> 06:48.122
And you will.

06:48.146 --> 06:49.666
He's recovering from
surgery right now.

06:49.690 --> 06:51.256
Surgery? What happened to him?

06:51.280 --> 06:53.476
You were both in an accident.

06:53.500 --> 06:56.261
You suffered a laceration to
your ribs, and your friend...

06:56.285 --> 06:58.132
- Lance. His name is Lance.
- Okay.

06:58.156 --> 07:00.134
Lance fractured his femur.

07:00.158 --> 07:01.788
What? What happened to us?

07:01.812 --> 07:03.703
You were in a car accident.

07:03.727 --> 07:04.927
He was pinned behind the wheel

07:04.951 --> 07:06.605
when the EMTs arrived
on the scene.

07:09.124 --> 07:11.189
Wh...

07:11.213 --> 07:12.799
What about... What
about the man?

07:12.823 --> 07:14.063
What about the man in the road?

07:14.087 --> 07:15.672
I'm sorry?

07:15.696 --> 07:18.675
The two of you were
brought in alone.

07:18.699 --> 07:20.265
There was nobody with you.

07:22.790 --> 07:24.332
Okay.

07:24.356 --> 07:26.968
I'm gonna send the
doctor in to see you...

07:28.404 --> 07:30.077
and then we'll see
what we can do

07:30.101 --> 07:33.429
about taking you to
see Lance, okay?

07:33.453 --> 07:34.802
Here we go.

07:36.107 --> 07:38.303
Thank you, Barb...

07:38.327 --> 07:39.720
Barbara.

07:40.938 --> 07:42.679
Thank you, Barbara.

07:45.203 --> 07:46.727
You can call be Barb.

08:00.131 --> 08:02.090
- He's right in there.
- Thank you.

08:08.139 --> 08:10.161
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:10.185 --> 08:11.684
I've been waiting for you.

08:11.708 --> 08:13.188
How are you feeling?

08:14.711 --> 08:17.037
Like crap.

08:17.061 --> 08:18.976
But the drugs have helped.

08:21.065 --> 08:22.478
How are you feeling?

08:22.502 --> 08:24.088
I'm fine.

08:24.112 --> 08:25.916
I'm just glad you're okay.

08:25.940 --> 08:28.396
I'm so sorry, baby.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.224
Don't be sorry.

08:30.248 --> 08:32.530
- I didn't see him until the last second...
- Lance...

08:32.554 --> 08:34.272
it was an accident.

08:34.296 --> 08:35.818
He jumped out into the road.

08:38.996 --> 08:41.876
Sorry to bother you guys, but there's
a Detective Thames here to see you.

08:44.174 --> 08:45.892
Okay. Send him in.

08:45.916 --> 08:47.396
- Right this way.
- Thanks. Thank you.

08:48.484 --> 08:50.593
Hi. Pardon the interruption.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.595
I just need a minute to collect

08:52.619 --> 08:55.119
an official statement regarding
the accident, all right?

08:55.143 --> 08:56.536
Of course.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.782
Do we know what happened
to the man we hit?

08:59.806 --> 09:01.068
Yeah, is he gonna be okay?

09:04.456 --> 09:05.651
You know, I...

09:05.675 --> 09:07.285
I'm sorry.

09:09.636 --> 09:12.397
But you'll be glad to know
that your blood alcohol test

09:12.421 --> 09:14.312
came back below the legal limit.

09:14.336 --> 09:16.856
So as of right now, I am only here
to get an official statement.

09:17.948 --> 09:19.123
All right?

09:27.349 --> 09:29.327
Bottom line, Brooke,
is you guys need to be

09:29.351 --> 09:31.068
incredibly thankful
that you survived.

09:31.092 --> 09:33.200
I know.

09:33.224 --> 09:34.854
Just can't believe he died.

09:34.878 --> 09:36.682
It wasn't your fault.

09:36.706 --> 09:38.839
That guy jumped out
in front of your car.

09:42.494 --> 09:44.081
I guarantee you
they will find out

09:44.105 --> 09:46.126
he was hopped up on something.

09:46.150 --> 09:47.867
He could have
killed both of you.

09:47.891 --> 09:49.956
I texted you Gwen's number.

09:49.980 --> 09:51.479
Besides being
Marco's girlfriend,

09:51.503 --> 09:53.143
she is the best attorney
on the West Side.

09:53.167 --> 09:54.265
Oh, my god.

09:54.289 --> 09:56.136
I haven't even spoken to Marco.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.573
No worries.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.139
He just wants you to heal up

09:59.163 --> 10:01.098
and come back when you're ready.

10:01.122 --> 10:02.962
Sorry to interrupt. I
need to change your pack.

10:04.255 --> 10:06.103
Hey Connie, let
me call you back.

10:06.127 --> 10:07.234
Thanks again.

10:07.258 --> 10:08.303
Okay. Bye.

10:19.662 --> 10:20.881
Are you okay?

10:22.099 --> 10:23.294
Yeah.

10:23.318 --> 10:24.600
Sorry.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.167
I'm just having one
of those days.

10:27.191 --> 10:29.387
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah. Lost a patient.

10:29.411 --> 10:32.303
She's had a heart disease
for a long time,

10:32.327 --> 10:33.696
but she finally died last night.

10:33.720 --> 10:34.880
She was one of our favorites.

10:34.904 --> 10:36.350
I'm so sorry.

10:36.374 --> 10:38.048
Well, it goes with
the territory.

10:38.072 --> 10:39.752
You'd think I'd be used
to it, but I'm not.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.966
In happier news...

10:42.990 --> 10:45.271
I heard that you and Lance are
gonna be released tomorrow.

10:45.295 --> 10:46.688
Yeah.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.997
I'm so happy that Lance is okay.

10:54.741 --> 10:57.807
It's important to know that
your loved ones are safe.

10:57.831 --> 11:00.113
Hey, um...

11:00.137 --> 11:01.941
I was informed that
Lance would need

11:01.965 --> 11:03.726
an in-home nurse for
a couple of weeks.

11:03.750 --> 11:05.110
I was wondering if
that's something

11:05.134 --> 11:06.772
they give you leave to do?

11:06.796 --> 11:09.122
Unfortunately no, but
we do have a database

11:09.146 --> 11:11.951
of referrals from the different
insurance companies.

11:11.975 --> 11:13.692
We can help you set that up.

11:13.716 --> 11:16.347
Okay. Thank you.

11:16.371 --> 11:19.243
- Drink some water.
- Okay.

11:21.071 --> 11:22.507
Feel better.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.363
Brooke! Hey!

11:32.387 --> 11:34.067
I'm glad I caught you
guys before you left.

11:34.091 --> 11:36.367
So look, we found you
a pre-approved nurse

11:36.391 --> 11:39.022
under your insurance provider for
up to six weeks of in-home care.

11:39.046 --> 11:40.545
She can do physical
therapy, too.

11:40.569 --> 11:42.025
Great! Thank you.

11:42.049 --> 11:43.548
Definitely. You guys take care.

11:43.572 --> 11:44.941
- You, too.
- Yeah. Thanks, Paul.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.682
All right...

11:46.706 --> 11:48.466
Ready to get out of here?

11:48.490 --> 11:50.840
- Oh, yeah.
- Let's go.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.466
- Okay...
- Okay...

12:13.950 --> 12:16.712
Oh, god. Okay.

12:16.736 --> 12:17.911
All right.

12:21.784 --> 12:23.196
Thank God for oxy.

12:23.220 --> 12:24.308
Are you okay?

12:25.483 --> 12:26.528
Yeah.

12:28.008 --> 12:29.488
Are you sure you don't
want me to hang

12:29.512 --> 12:31.378
around for just a
couple of more days?

12:31.402 --> 12:33.424
We can postpone
this nurse thing.

12:33.448 --> 12:34.841
No, babe. I'll be fine.

12:36.016 --> 12:37.626
Stop worrying so much.

12:39.149 --> 12:42.128
You need to get back to
your big new promotion.

12:42.152 --> 12:43.521
I know.

12:43.545 --> 12:45.436
I just want to make sure
you're taken care of.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.916
Oh, I know.

12:46.940 --> 12:49.048
But I'll have this new nurse.

12:49.072 --> 12:50.833
I'll be fine.

12:50.857 --> 12:53.705
She's coming by for an
interview in the morning.

12:53.729 --> 12:55.533
She sounded really
nice on the phone.

12:55.557 --> 12:57.753
Wonderful.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.406
Is there anything you
need from school?

12:59.430 --> 13:00.990
I can pick it up for
you in the morning.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.061
No, I think I'm okay.

13:02.085 --> 13:03.541
I got everything I
need on my laptop.

13:03.565 --> 13:05.891
I called the school this
morning and told them

13:05.915 --> 13:08.024
I'd keep working from home.

13:08.048 --> 13:09.808
They're having me
rebuild the site.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.375
- Mm!
- Yeah.

13:11.399 --> 13:13.439
Well, you're the best cyber
builder in the business.

13:13.463 --> 13:14.725
That's me.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.817
If I didn't have this
stupid leg thing,

13:18.841 --> 13:21.080
I'd rebuild your site right now.

13:21.104 --> 13:22.647
What does that even mean?

13:22.671 --> 13:24.257
I have no idea.

13:24.281 --> 13:25.781
- Mm.
- Come here.

13:25.805 --> 13:26.805
Okay.

13:29.896 --> 13:31.482
Okay. Careful.

13:31.506 --> 13:32.506
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:33.725 --> 13:36.728
Oh, this feels so good.

13:38.165 --> 13:40.578
It's good to be home.

13:40.602 --> 13:42.212
It's good to be home.

13:55.356 --> 13:56.705
All right...

13:58.098 --> 14:00.728
I'm sure it won't be as
good as the hospital food,

14:00.752 --> 14:03.035
but just give it a shot.

14:03.059 --> 14:04.732
Oh, babe. Thank you.

14:04.756 --> 14:06.865
- It looks amazing.
- Mm-hmm.

14:06.889 --> 14:10.347
Look listen, when I heal up,
let's go take a trip somewhere.

14:10.371 --> 14:12.218
That little inn
in Santa Barbara?

14:12.242 --> 14:14.177
Oh, yes.

14:14.201 --> 14:15.700
The one where we
lock ourselves in

14:15.724 --> 14:17.920
all weekend like
hibernating cubs?

14:17.944 --> 14:20.052
Oh.

14:20.076 --> 14:23.447
And that would be your
prospective nurse.

14:23.471 --> 14:25.255
I'll get it.

14:28.911 --> 14:31.281
Hi. I'm Chloe.

14:31.305 --> 14:34.458
Hi, Chloe. I'm Brooke.

14:34.482 --> 14:36.808
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, it's nice to meet you.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.505
Why don't you come on in?

14:38.529 --> 14:39.704
Okay.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.607
- Oh, very smooth.
- Oh, my.

14:53.631 --> 14:56.088
Uh... paper towels in there?

14:56.112 --> 14:58.743
- I got it.
- Oh please, it's my job.

14:58.767 --> 15:00.266
Oh, god.

15:00.290 --> 15:02.834
I didn't know Maxim
Magazine staffed nurses.

15:02.858 --> 15:04.599
Not laughing.

15:09.256 --> 15:10.537
- There.
- Thanks.

15:10.561 --> 15:12.191
Yeah. You might wanna...

15:12.215 --> 15:13.932
I'll grab that.

15:13.956 --> 15:16.437
Thanks, but I'm not
a complete invalid.

15:18.091 --> 15:19.546
You must be Lance.

15:19.570 --> 15:20.876
It's nice to meet you, Chloe.

15:22.138 --> 15:24.421
How's the leg feeling today?

15:24.445 --> 15:29.382
Sore and stiff but...
better than yesterday.

15:29.406 --> 15:31.036
That's normal.

15:31.060 --> 15:33.473
Your report said you suffered
a nasty femoral fracture.

15:33.497 --> 15:35.562
Yeah. It wasn't pretty.

15:35.586 --> 15:37.458
Why don't you have
a seat, Chloe?

15:39.547 --> 15:41.786
Can I get you anything to drink?

15:41.810 --> 15:44.223
Uh... no. I'm good. Thanks.

15:44.247 --> 15:46.573
So how long have you
been doing this for?

15:46.597 --> 15:50.969
Oh, practically my whole life. Um...
my parents worked a lot,

15:50.993 --> 15:53.015
- so I looked after my sick grandmother...
- Ow!

15:53.039 --> 15:54.359
From the time that I was eight.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.758
Um... I realized then

15:57.782 --> 15:59.282
that this was what
I wanted to be.

15:59.306 --> 16:02.546
I went to nursing school
right out of high school

16:02.570 --> 16:05.288
and 23 patients
later, here I am!

16:05.312 --> 16:07.183
Oh, sorry.

16:08.924 --> 16:10.032
Of course.

16:10.056 --> 16:11.337
What?

16:11.361 --> 16:13.687
Renee and Alejandro
called in sick.

16:13.711 --> 16:16.168
I wasn't supposed to go
back until tomorrow.

16:16.192 --> 16:18.272
Uh, I've got nothing planned
for the rest of the day.

16:18.296 --> 16:20.346
I'd be happy to
look after Lance.

16:20.370 --> 16:22.210
- You could think of it as a trial run.
- Oh...

16:23.808 --> 16:25.308
- Really?
- Go.

16:25.332 --> 16:27.266
I'll be fine, babe.

16:27.290 --> 16:28.900
Go do your sous chef thing.

16:31.381 --> 16:32.880
Are you sure you don't mind?

16:32.904 --> 16:34.099
Of course not.

16:34.123 --> 16:35.448
Okay.

16:35.472 --> 16:38.277
Well in that case then, um...

16:38.301 --> 16:40.181
let's go in the kitchen
and I'll run you through

16:40.205 --> 16:42.045
- his meds and his allergies and stuff.
- Okay.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.990
Come on, people working!

16:55.014 --> 16:58.080
Well, it seems like I don't need
to find a replacement after all.

16:58.104 --> 16:59.168
As if you could.

16:59.192 --> 17:01.170
Brooke, I need you to dazzle me

17:01.194 --> 17:03.781
with an appetizer for
tonight's special, okay?

17:03.805 --> 17:05.478
It's nice to have you back.

17:05.502 --> 17:07.089
I'm glad you're okay.

17:07.113 --> 17:09.134
Work for me!

17:09.157 --> 17:11.136
He did miss you, you know.

17:11.160 --> 17:13.790
Yeah, I can tell.

17:13.815 --> 17:15.184
So how's Lance doing?

17:15.208 --> 17:16.707
Better.

17:16.731 --> 17:18.883
We got him all set up in
the den, a little ramp...

17:18.906 --> 17:20.145
He's good to go.

17:20.169 --> 17:22.626
And how's the nurse
search comin'?

17:22.650 --> 17:24.569
Actually, we have someone
watching him right now.

17:24.594 --> 17:26.455
Uh, she seems very competent.

17:26.480 --> 17:28.414
And very stunning.

17:28.438 --> 17:30.112
Uh-oh.

17:30.136 --> 17:32.679
No. I totally trust Lance.

17:32.703 --> 17:34.986
Just like he totally trusts me.

17:35.010 --> 17:37.230
Okay.

17:38.405 --> 17:41.103
It's just... men are men.

17:42.846 --> 17:45.127
That's probably the most brilliant
thing you've ever said.

17:45.151 --> 17:47.390
I mean, it's in their
genetic make up.

17:47.414 --> 17:49.720
They can't help themselves.

17:51.374 --> 17:53.396
Lance can.

17:53.420 --> 17:55.137
Well, the good news
is he's got you,

17:55.161 --> 17:56.964
so why would he want
anyone else, right?

17:56.988 --> 17:58.033
Right.

18:06.302 --> 18:07.801
Hey.

18:07.825 --> 18:09.673
Hey, babe.

18:09.697 --> 18:11.196
How are you feeling?

18:11.220 --> 18:14.025
Actually, it's the most
comfortable I've felt yet.

18:14.049 --> 18:15.659
Oh, that's great.

18:18.227 --> 18:20.379
Oh, sorry.

18:20.403 --> 18:21.380
Hi, Brooke!

18:21.404 --> 18:23.774
Hey, Chloe.

18:23.798 --> 18:25.471
Did you do laundry, too?

18:25.495 --> 18:26.951
Yeah. You know, there were just

18:26.975 --> 18:29.095
a few loads in there, so I
figured I'd just, you know.

18:29.119 --> 18:31.825
Are you kidding me?
Thank you so much.

18:31.849 --> 18:34.176
Should I take 'em upstairs?

18:34.200 --> 18:36.787
No. Put it down. I'll
take care of it.

18:36.811 --> 18:38.180
Are you sure?

18:38.204 --> 18:39.790
It's not a problem.

18:39.814 --> 18:41.974
Chloe, you weren't even
supposed to come to work today.

18:41.998 --> 18:42.975
I think you've done enough.

18:42.999 --> 18:44.664
Okay.

18:44.688 --> 18:46.492
So can you come back
tomorrow at 9:00?

18:46.516 --> 18:49.278
Absolutely. Thank you.

18:49.302 --> 18:50.975
Happy to have you.

18:50.999 --> 18:52.542
Happy to be had.

18:52.566 --> 18:54.239
And Lance is in good hands.

18:54.263 --> 18:55.656
I can see that.

18:57.310 --> 18:58.678
So I brought home some dinner.

18:58.702 --> 18:59.984
Why don't you stay and join us?

19:00.008 --> 19:03.161
Oh... Oh, gosh. No. That...
I... Thank you.

19:03.185 --> 19:05.105
That's very kind of you,
but you guys should have

19:05.129 --> 19:07.410
your time together and I need
to get back to my boyfriend.

19:07.434 --> 19:08.775
It's my night to make dinner.

19:08.799 --> 19:11.359
Oh. Well in that case, you'll have
to take some of this with you.

19:11.383 --> 19:13.345
Save yourself the trouble.

19:13.369 --> 19:15.739
Oh, wow. Thank you.

19:15.763 --> 19:18.307
That... that is so sweet of you.
Thank you.

19:18.331 --> 19:19.525
All right.

19:19.549 --> 19:21.223
Well, goodnight.

19:21.247 --> 19:22.311
Goodnight, Lance!

19:22.335 --> 19:23.399
Goodnight, Chloe.

19:23.423 --> 19:24.685
- Bye.
- Bye!

19:27.166 --> 19:28.166
Bye!

19:32.475 --> 19:34.061
Right?

19:34.085 --> 19:36.000
That was better than I thought.

19:39.265 --> 19:41.243
- I missed you.
- I missed you.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.833
Get some of this.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.895
We agreed no boots on the couch.

20:10.470 --> 20:11.751
And you agreed you wouldn't see

20:11.775 --> 20:13.840
anymore male patients
after the last one.

20:13.864 --> 20:16.800
Well, sometimes I
don't get a choice.

20:16.824 --> 20:18.565
Someone's gotta pay the
bills around here.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.981
Was he good-looking?

20:24.005 --> 20:25.461
Yep.

20:25.485 --> 20:27.226
And so is his wife.

20:30.185 --> 20:32.032
Seriously?

20:32.056 --> 20:33.275
James, get off.

20:34.494 --> 20:37.299
James, I said get off of me!
James!

20:37.323 --> 20:39.823
James! James, get off!

20:39.847 --> 20:41.477
James get...

20:41.501 --> 20:42.589
Ah!

21:47.610 --> 21:49.133
You'll need to
finish that by noon.

21:51.135 --> 21:52.311
Diuresis.

21:53.442 --> 21:55.377
Excuse me?

21:55.401 --> 21:57.379
When a person is supplying
the shift of blood

21:57.403 --> 22:00.295
from the legs into the thorax,
it increases atrial stress,

22:00.319 --> 22:03.123
stimulating the release of
ANP, which initiates diuresis,

22:03.147 --> 22:04.560
leading to significant
water loss.

22:04.584 --> 22:07.171
- Okay, you lost me at "When."
- Ha.

22:07.195 --> 22:08.738
Sorry.

22:08.762 --> 22:11.002
Sometimes I get a little carried
away with the tech talk.

22:11.026 --> 22:12.481
Um...

22:12.505 --> 22:14.744
The bottom line is, because
you're on bed rest,

22:14.768 --> 22:16.572
there's an increase
of urine output

22:16.596 --> 22:18.530
and less blood volume,
which means...

22:18.554 --> 22:20.706
dehydration.

22:20.730 --> 22:23.037
Drink up, my friend.

22:25.126 --> 22:27.955
Okay so, I made up
a little schedule.

22:29.652 --> 22:31.978
We want to make sure the
only atrophy happens

22:32.002 --> 22:34.241
on the bum leg and not
th rest of your body

22:34.265 --> 22:37.157
and you should know that I combine
traditional nursing practices

22:37.181 --> 22:39.334
with eastern
Nepalese philosophy,

22:39.358 --> 22:41.074
which is not only
proven effective,

22:41.098 --> 22:44.077
but has proven a
speedier recovery.

22:44.101 --> 22:47.167
- Well, I'm all for a speedier recovery.
- I thought so.

22:47.191 --> 22:49.344
All right. Let's get
started, shall we?

22:49.368 --> 22:52.129
Kay, left hand out, please.

22:52.153 --> 22:53.739
Keep the hand open.

22:53.763 --> 22:55.306
Okay.

22:55.330 --> 22:57.700
So there's five major
pressure points on the hand

22:57.724 --> 23:00.901
and the arm that serve as a
breaker box to the body.

23:04.557 --> 23:06.535
Oh, I feel that in my low neck.

23:06.559 --> 23:10.277
Good. Now you should feel
this one in your left side.

23:10.301 --> 23:11.888
Oh, my god.

23:11.912 --> 23:14.194
Okay...

23:14.218 --> 23:16.980
And there's this one that
not only relieves pressure,

23:17.004 --> 23:19.330
but it stimulates muscle
activity in your lower legs.

23:19.354 --> 23:21.724
That's incredible.

23:21.748 --> 23:23.750
Oh, I totally feel that.

23:25.926 --> 23:27.667
Okay. And here's the last one.

23:53.519 --> 23:55.119
You don't want to
overstimulate your body

23:55.143 --> 23:57.624
on our first go around,
so just drink that water.

24:12.581 --> 24:14.298
It was just weird.

24:14.322 --> 24:15.908
It's like a slap in the face.

24:15.932 --> 24:18.694
Literally the entire box
of pasta in the trash.

24:18.718 --> 24:20.696
Well come on, maybe she's vegan

24:20.720 --> 24:22.524
or lactose intolerant
and she didn't want

24:22.548 --> 24:24.288
to come across
rude or flatulent.

24:25.986 --> 24:27.093
Yeah, I guess you're right.

24:27.117 --> 24:28.399
I could be overreacting.

24:28.423 --> 24:30.488
You? No...

24:30.512 --> 24:32.359
What? I don't overreact.

24:32.383 --> 24:34.690
I don't overreact!

24:36.387 --> 24:37.539
What?

24:37.563 --> 24:38.651
I don't.

24:51.577 --> 24:52.902
Okay.

24:52.926 --> 24:54.773
Hey Lance, I just got
a text from Brooke.

24:54.797 --> 24:57.428
She said that she's
working late tonight.

24:57.452 --> 25:00.039
What do you think you're doing?

25:00.063 --> 25:02.172
My bladder is about 30
seconds from imploding.

25:02.196 --> 25:04.174
Okay. We'll get you
to the bathroom...

25:04.198 --> 25:05.958
together and carefully.

25:05.982 --> 25:07.090
There you go.

25:07.114 --> 25:08.394
All right, all right, all right.

25:08.418 --> 25:10.572
We're going, we're going.

25:10.596 --> 25:12.676
- Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
- There we go.

25:12.700 --> 25:13.488
Okay.

25:13.512 --> 25:16.969
So you a fan of
Thai food or what?

25:16.993 --> 25:19.232
- I love Thai food.
- Yeah?

25:19.256 --> 25:21.176
I never get to have it
'cause Brooke's not a fan.

25:21.200 --> 25:22.627
- Oh.
- Are we getting Thai food?

25:22.651 --> 25:24.890
- Yeah. Absolutely. We're gonna order it.
- Awesome.

25:24.914 --> 25:26.457
Must be your lucky night.

25:26.481 --> 25:28.178
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, we got it.

25:29.658 --> 25:31.767
- Okay.
- Okay. Hold on.

25:31.791 --> 25:33.638
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I'm going as fast as I can.

25:33.662 --> 25:35.205
- I know, I know, I know.
- All right.

25:35.229 --> 25:36.598
Okay. I think I
got it from here.

25:36.622 --> 25:37.990
- Oh!
- Okay.

25:38.014 --> 25:39.601
All right, let's
do this together.

25:39.625 --> 25:40.993
- Nice and easy...
- All right.

25:41.017 --> 25:42.560
Okay.

25:42.584 --> 25:45.084
Slowly, slowly.
Just slowly there.

25:45.108 --> 25:46.303
All right.

25:46.327 --> 25:47.763
- Okay.
- Okay. Go ahead.

25:53.203 --> 25:55.051
Lance, this is what
I do for a living.

25:55.075 --> 25:56.635
Go ahead. It's all
very technical to me.

26:17.097 --> 26:18.272
Okay.

26:20.100 --> 26:21.797
There you go.

26:26.149 --> 26:27.586
Fire away.

26:29.718 --> 26:30.763
Stage fright.

26:34.549 --> 26:35.855
I'll plug my ears.

26:55.048 --> 26:58.593
Yeah, my family are
crazy about basketball.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.977
When I was a kid, my dad had
season tickets to the Clippers.

27:01.001 --> 27:02.892
And it didn't matter if
they were down by 20

27:02.916 --> 27:05.425
in the last five minutes,
we had to stay to the end.

27:05.449 --> 27:07.297
Um, my uncle had
season tickets, too.

27:07.321 --> 27:08.559
- No.
- Yeah.

27:08.583 --> 27:11.780
We were there every
game to the bitter end.

27:11.804 --> 27:13.477
Oh, so that was you
seated across from us.

27:13.501 --> 27:14.633
Yeah, that was us!

27:16.765 --> 27:17.960
Ooh.

27:17.984 --> 27:19.614
Are you okay?

27:19.638 --> 27:21.572
Yeah. I just started
to feel light-headed.

27:21.596 --> 27:23.052
Okay.

27:23.076 --> 27:24.730
Let's get you moving
around a bit.

27:26.557 --> 27:27.733
Ooh.

27:37.046 --> 27:38.415
Better?

27:38.439 --> 27:40.049
Yeah.

27:41.964 --> 27:43.226
Yeah. A lot.

27:44.575 --> 27:45.575
Thanks, Chloe.

27:47.274 --> 27:49.731
I really, really appreciate it.

27:49.755 --> 27:51.384
It's my job.

27:51.408 --> 27:52.845
A very admirable one at that.

27:54.368 --> 27:55.737
Unlike mine.

27:55.761 --> 27:57.347
What do you do?

27:57.371 --> 27:58.740
I'm a web designer.

27:58.764 --> 28:00.959
That's a great job!

28:00.983 --> 28:02.961
Come on, everybody
needs a website.

28:02.985 --> 28:04.354
Yeah.

28:04.378 --> 28:05.938
Oh, you know what?
This could be Brooke.

28:08.295 --> 28:09.513
Brooke?

28:11.907 --> 28:12.907
No.

28:14.040 --> 28:15.191
You okay?

28:15.215 --> 28:17.454
Yeah.

28:17.478 --> 28:19.045
That wasn't too convincing.

28:21.787 --> 28:23.765
Relationship issues.

28:23.789 --> 28:26.313
Mm. Those are fun.

28:27.488 --> 28:28.924
Yeah...

28:30.883 --> 28:32.603
Just tell me they stop
once you get married.

28:35.017 --> 28:36.323
I wouldn't know.

28:38.281 --> 28:40.129
Brooke and I aren't married.

28:40.153 --> 28:42.305
- Get outta here.
- Yeah.

28:42.329 --> 28:43.915
Well, not yet at least.

28:43.939 --> 28:46.483
I asked her a year ago, but...

28:46.507 --> 28:48.067
she has this theory
that we need to wait

28:48.091 --> 28:49.616
until the three year mark.

28:49.640 --> 28:50.792
Really?

28:50.816 --> 28:52.271
Yeah.

28:52.295 --> 28:54.602
At first I was bitter
about it, but...

28:56.125 --> 28:59.085
You know, after a while, I
started to understand it.

29:02.436 --> 29:03.698
Now, this texting guy.

29:04.873 --> 29:05.873
Is he the one for you?

29:09.399 --> 29:10.792
I don't know.

29:14.143 --> 29:15.686
Sorry, I just...

29:15.710 --> 29:18.321
I always envisioned the guy
that I ended up with...

29:19.975 --> 29:21.368
treating me like a princess.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.477
And this one, not so much.

29:24.501 --> 29:26.765
Then dump him.

29:28.549 --> 29:29.874
Seriously.

29:29.898 --> 29:31.658
Why shouldn't you be
treated like a princess?

29:33.162 --> 29:35.556
You deserve that, don't you?

29:38.777 --> 29:40.039
Why settle?

29:51.615 --> 29:53.855
I appreciate you staying
a little longer.

29:53.879 --> 29:55.682
Oh, come on. It's my pleasure.

29:55.706 --> 29:57.946
You know, Lance is one of
the more civilized patients

29:57.970 --> 29:59.774
I've had in a long time.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.776
Here. I packed you a
little something.

30:01.800 --> 30:02.844
Oh...

30:04.454 --> 30:06.041
Uh, we ordered in
Thai food tonight.

30:06.065 --> 30:07.825
- I'm full.
- Great!

30:07.849 --> 30:10.654
I'm so relieved he finally has
someone to enjoy Thai with.

30:10.678 --> 30:12.395
Cool.

30:12.419 --> 30:14.659
Just for future knowledge, are
you allergic to any foods?

30:14.683 --> 30:15.528
No.

30:15.552 --> 30:16.921
Okay. So you're not vegan

30:16.945 --> 30:19.010
or you don't have an
allergy to pasta?

30:19.034 --> 30:20.707
No, I love pasta.

30:20.731 --> 30:22.884
Which by the way, thank
you again for last night.

30:22.908 --> 30:24.363
The pasta was delicious.

30:24.387 --> 30:26.931
Sure. My pleasure.

30:26.955 --> 30:28.846
Okay. Well, you
have a good night.

30:28.870 --> 30:30.263
Bye, Lance.

30:36.530 --> 30:38.290
I don't know what to say, love.

30:38.314 --> 30:41.467
Maybe she has an
aversion to Italian food

30:41.491 --> 30:43.165
and she didn't want to tell you.

30:43.189 --> 30:44.862
Why wouldn't she
want to tell me?

30:44.886 --> 30:46.733
Who knows?

30:46.757 --> 30:48.605
Maybe because you're a sous chef

30:48.629 --> 30:50.433
at an authentic
Italian restaurant

30:50.457 --> 30:52.783
and she didn't want
to offend you.

30:52.807 --> 30:54.219
It's just odd.

30:54.243 --> 30:56.047
It's like she wanted me
to see it, you know...

30:56.071 --> 30:58.204
putting it in our trash can.

31:03.687 --> 31:04.863
Nice.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.900
There's my lady.

31:44.293 --> 31:45.792
I'm going to bed.

31:45.816 --> 31:47.838
Hey, hey, hey.

31:47.862 --> 31:49.318
Hey!

31:49.342 --> 31:51.494
Is that how you treat
the man you're with?

31:51.518 --> 31:53.235
How 'bout a proper hello?

31:53.259 --> 31:55.454
Just get off me, okay?

31:55.478 --> 31:56.891
What?

31:56.915 --> 32:00.440
Baby, I'm just trying
to spread the love.

32:13.540 --> 32:15.126
- Hey.
- Hi.

32:15.150 --> 32:16.736
- Thanks for coming,
- Oh, of course.

32:16.760 --> 32:18.327
Come on in.

32:21.374 --> 32:23.134
His name was Darren Wells.

32:23.158 --> 32:24.788
Mid 40s. He drove
a delivery truck.

32:24.812 --> 32:26.355
He was off that night.

32:26.379 --> 32:28.923
The toxicology lab reported
that he had a very high

32:28.947 --> 32:30.387
amount of alcohol
in his bloodstream.

32:30.411 --> 32:32.404
Apparently he was a
recovering addict

32:32.428 --> 32:34.276
who had taken to heavy drinking.

32:34.300 --> 32:36.887
I spoke with a DA, who
is a personal friend,

32:36.911 --> 32:39.107
and I think that this is
just one of those cases

32:39.131 --> 32:41.022
that tends to go away.

32:41.046 --> 32:44.242
But... I mean, that poor man.

32:44.266 --> 32:46.984
We just feel so bad
about what happened.

32:47.008 --> 32:48.943
Did he have a family?

32:48.967 --> 32:51.336
Well, since both of his
parents are deceased,

32:51.360 --> 32:54.818
I really don't foresee a lawsuit
or anything of that nature.

32:54.842 --> 32:56.733
Well, was he married
or did he have kids?

32:56.757 --> 32:58.561
Nope. Just a brother
in Wisconsin.

32:58.585 --> 33:00.563
But I believe that
if a suit was filed,

33:00.587 --> 33:03.107
we would have already heard about
it from the county courthouse.

33:03.131 --> 33:04.436
I don't know.

33:04.460 --> 33:06.090
I feel like we should at least

33:06.114 --> 33:08.788
reach out to his brother
and send our condolences.

33:08.812 --> 33:10.573
That is very sweet
of you, Brooke,

33:10.597 --> 33:12.270
but I don't recommend it.

33:12.294 --> 33:14.664
In these cases, it's
best to just lay low

33:14.688 --> 33:17.101
and let him grieve his loss
because the bottom line is,

33:17.125 --> 33:18.929
the two of you were
victims in the situation

33:18.953 --> 33:20.781
just as much as he was.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.642
This is top five for sure.

33:36.666 --> 33:38.905
- For reals?
- For reals.

33:38.929 --> 33:41.929
Yes! Because I'm going to feature it at
the restaurant fundraiser on Friday.

33:41.953 --> 33:44.085
Well seriously, hon,
it's phenomenal.

33:44.109 --> 33:46.043
I'm already thinking
about seconds.

33:46.067 --> 33:48.045
Well somebody sure has
his appetite back.

33:48.069 --> 33:49.916
I know.

33:49.940 --> 33:52.963
I'm feeling more like myself
these past couple of days.

33:52.987 --> 33:54.791
I guess Chloe's doing
something right.

33:54.815 --> 33:56.010
Seriously, hon.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.114
She knows what she's doing.

33:57.138 --> 33:58.708
She uses this traditional.

33:58.732 --> 34:02.103
Nepalese medical philosophy
with these pressure points

34:02.127 --> 34:04.670
and herbal medicine...

34:04.694 --> 34:06.846
- The pain has been cut in half.
- Oh, my god.

34:06.870 --> 34:09.197
That's great, sweetie.

34:09.221 --> 34:11.938
And here I am being so selfish

34:11.962 --> 34:14.985
and complaining about her when
she's helping you get healthy.

34:15.009 --> 34:16.639
I'm awful.

34:16.663 --> 34:18.099
Yes, you are.

34:19.360 --> 34:20.884
Seconds, please.

34:23.713 --> 34:26.909
- All right.
- More... more...

34:26.934 --> 34:28.196
- Okay.
- Uh-huh. There we go.

34:50.914 --> 34:52.501
Oh!

34:52.525 --> 34:54.165
So sorry I didn't mean
to sneak up on you.

34:54.188 --> 34:56.157
No, no. I'm just a big baby.

34:56.181 --> 34:57.767
No.

34:57.791 --> 34:59.160
You look pretty.

34:59.184 --> 35:01.553
Thanks.

35:01.577 --> 35:03.947
They were just giving
away free makeup samples

35:03.971 --> 35:06.297
at Bloomingdale's, so
I thought, "Why not?"

35:06.321 --> 35:08.865
I love makeup samples.

35:08.889 --> 35:11.737
Yeah. I wish they were giving away
free samples of your perfume.

35:11.761 --> 35:13.261
I love that.

35:13.285 --> 35:14.305
Oh, thank you.

35:14.329 --> 35:15.959
It's Lance's favorite.

35:15.983 --> 35:17.917
It's called Forbidden Romance.

35:17.941 --> 35:20.141
It's actually one of the more
affordable ones out there.

35:22.381 --> 35:24.576
Uh, Chloe, I just wanted to
say how much I appreciate

35:24.600 --> 35:26.491
everything that you're
doing for Lance.

35:26.515 --> 35:29.103
It's my pleasure.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.017
Not to mention, my job, which...

35:31.041 --> 35:32.321
I should get back to our patient

35:32.345 --> 35:34.151
'cause Lord knows he's
gonna need help again

35:34.175 --> 35:35.568
aiming for that toilet.

36:08.209 --> 36:10.013
Okay.

36:10.037 --> 36:13.040
Your meal of
champions is served.

36:14.694 --> 36:15.845
Ta-da!

36:15.869 --> 36:17.238
A very colorful display.

36:17.262 --> 36:19.065
It's no Brooke, but I'm shooting

36:19.089 --> 36:20.719
to be better than the hospital.

36:20.743 --> 36:22.765
You're really reaching
for that gold standard.

36:22.789 --> 36:25.420
All right, let's
get you situated.

36:25.444 --> 36:27.770
I recognize that fragrance.

36:27.794 --> 36:29.467
Do you like it?

36:29.491 --> 36:30.686
It's a favorite of Brooke's.

36:30.710 --> 36:32.166
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.645
Hm.

36:33.669 --> 36:35.995
So it's pins and
needles in my leg.

36:36.019 --> 36:37.040
Okay. Lower or upper?

36:37.064 --> 36:38.239
Lower.

36:42.069 --> 36:43.375
Okay...

36:49.381 --> 36:51.141
Um... I'm good.

36:51.165 --> 36:53.317
You... you nailed it.
I feel great.

36:53.341 --> 36:55.061
- Okay.
- Could you pass me my iPad, please?

36:55.822 --> 36:57.626
Not before you eat your soup.

36:57.650 --> 36:59.690
Oh, it's okay. I'm not really
that hungry right now.

36:59.714 --> 37:01.543
You've got to stick to
the program, Mister.

37:01.567 --> 37:03.525
And I slaved in the
kitchen all day!

37:04.744 --> 37:06.156
All right.

37:06.180 --> 37:07.225
Yes, ma'am.

37:11.011 --> 37:12.597
So?

37:12.621 --> 37:14.295
It's delicious.

37:14.319 --> 37:16.277
Simple, yet so robust.

37:18.845 --> 37:19.889
Oh.

37:21.195 --> 37:22.477
Okay, let's...

37:22.501 --> 37:24.174
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

37:24.198 --> 37:25.523
Here...

37:25.547 --> 37:26.707
Yeah, let's just take it off.

37:26.731 --> 37:27.906
Okay.

37:33.642 --> 37:34.793
Um...

37:34.817 --> 37:36.230
I'm gonna get you a clean shirt.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.255
- Okay.
- Yeah.

37:59.755 --> 38:03.455
I picked the blue one 'cause I
like this color best on you.

38:04.760 --> 38:06.153
All right...

38:07.546 --> 38:08.764
Arms up.

38:11.071 --> 38:12.246
Perfect.

38:13.987 --> 38:15.902
Oh, you got somethin'.

38:20.820 --> 38:22.276
Uh yeah, you know what?

38:22.300 --> 38:24.911
It's... it's not budging.

38:27.914 --> 38:28.915
Got it.

38:31.483 --> 38:32.658
Ah!

38:38.446 --> 38:40.381
That prick from the
Times is here!

38:40.405 --> 38:42.078
Hasn't reviewed me
in over twyears!

38:42.102 --> 38:43.582
- Harrison Duben?
- No. The other one.

38:43.606 --> 38:45.951
- Sherridan Tishman?
- No. The other one.

38:45.975 --> 38:47.692
The only other one
is Gena Slutzky.

38:47.716 --> 38:49.346
That prick.

38:49.370 --> 38:50.521
She almost ruined my career.

38:50.545 --> 38:52.218
Okay.

38:52.242 --> 38:55.483
I need something...
magic from you tonight.

38:55.507 --> 38:56.484
Can I count on you?

38:56.508 --> 38:58.007
Of course.

38:58.031 --> 38:59.400
That's my girl.

38:59.424 --> 39:01.924
Whose got table 49?

39:01.948 --> 39:03.428
I need his plated in five!

39:20.053 --> 39:22.248
- Hey.
- Hi.

39:22.272 --> 39:23.815
Is Brooke here?

39:23.839 --> 39:25.406
She had to work late again.

39:28.453 --> 39:31.194
Does it bother you that your
relationship is so one-sided?

39:32.457 --> 39:33.806
It's not one-sided.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.114
I think you deserve better.

39:41.204 --> 39:45.557
Like, a wise and incredibly handsome
man wouldn't simply settle.

39:48.429 --> 39:50.146
I took your advice, by the way.

39:50.170 --> 39:51.930
I dumped James.

39:51.954 --> 39:54.585
He was gone first
thing in the morning.

39:54.609 --> 39:56.959
Yeah well, I'm not settling.

39:58.526 --> 40:00.833
Brooke is everything
I ever wanted.

40:03.226 --> 40:04.750
I'm a very lucky man.

40:06.882 --> 40:08.860
Really?

40:08.884 --> 40:10.277
Yes.

40:12.148 --> 40:14.736
She turned down your
marriage proposal.

40:14.760 --> 40:16.718
She's never around
when you need her.

40:19.373 --> 40:21.419
Actions speak louder than words.

40:26.902 --> 40:28.358
Chloe, enough!

40:28.382 --> 40:30.186
What? Stop.

40:30.210 --> 40:32.971
Okay, you need to get
your things and leave!

40:32.995 --> 40:34.997
Lance, I'm sorry. I didn't...

40:36.303 --> 40:37.759
I mean...

40:37.783 --> 40:39.674
I was getting mixed messages.

40:39.698 --> 40:41.351
Excuse me?

40:42.831 --> 40:45.549
Okay, it was my fault.
Completely my fault.

40:45.573 --> 40:47.227
I crossed lines. I don't...

40:48.663 --> 40:52.406
Just kind of... am going
through a lot right now.

40:59.239 --> 41:01.304
Don't fire me.

41:01.328 --> 41:03.175
Please.

41:03.199 --> 41:05.027
Chloe, this is all
just so bizarre.

41:06.812 --> 41:09.094
I mean, I don't see any way
that we can keep you on.

41:09.118 --> 41:11.096
I screwed up, okay?

41:11.120 --> 41:12.489
I screwed up.

41:12.513 --> 41:15.187
It is not gonna happen again.
I promise you.

41:15.211 --> 41:17.668
All right, I'm gonna be completely
professional from now on.

41:17.692 --> 41:19.085
Okay?

41:21.043 --> 41:22.325
Please.

41:22.349 --> 41:24.177
Lance, please.

41:26.005 --> 41:29.332
All right, let's just call it
a day and sleep on it, okay?

41:29.356 --> 41:30.705
Okay.

41:32.185 --> 41:33.945
Um...

41:33.969 --> 41:35.686
I'm just gonna finish
the laundry...

41:35.710 --> 41:37.122
No. No need. It's fine.

41:37.146 --> 41:40.648
Just go home and get some rest.

41:40.672 --> 41:42.737
- Are... are you okay by yourself?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

41:42.761 --> 41:44.441
I'm just exhausted and
going back to sleep.

41:48.114 --> 41:50.072
I'm just gonna let
myself out then.

41:53.380 --> 41:54.642
Thank you...

41:56.035 --> 41:57.079
Lance.

41:59.168 --> 42:00.343
Sure.

42:01.780 --> 42:02.780
Okay.

42:33.681 --> 42:35.441
Whoa.

42:35.465 --> 42:37.574
Somebody's a little jumpy.

42:37.598 --> 42:39.426
Sweetheart.

42:40.993 --> 42:42.536
Thank God it's you.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.562
Who else would it be?

42:46.041 --> 42:48.063
Just had a nightmare.

42:48.087 --> 42:49.630
You know, people
coming after me.

42:49.654 --> 42:51.893
Oh, poor baby.

42:51.917 --> 42:53.919
Do you want me to
make it better?

43:07.672 --> 43:08.997
I missed you.

43:09.021 --> 43:10.457
I missed you, too.

43:11.719 --> 43:13.610
How was work?

43:13.634 --> 43:16.874
Stressful and amazing
all at the same time.

43:16.898 --> 43:18.683
We had the Times reviewer there.

43:20.162 --> 43:21.662
Anyway, I'll tell
you all about it,

43:21.686 --> 43:23.601
but first, I must shower.

43:25.690 --> 43:27.126
How was everything here today?

43:28.954 --> 43:30.322
Great.

43:30.346 --> 43:33.064
You know, just...
same old, same old.

43:33.088 --> 43:34.631
Great.

43:34.655 --> 43:35.961
Be back in a flash.

44:35.585 --> 44:36.998
Geeze!

44:37.022 --> 44:38.173
I didn't hear you come in.

44:38.197 --> 44:40.329
You shouldn't be moving
around without me.

44:44.420 --> 44:46.442
Actually, I feel good.

44:46.466 --> 44:48.749
Good enough that I can wheel
this thing on my own.

44:48.773 --> 44:51.969
Well, I am your nurse and
you need to do as I advise.

44:51.993 --> 44:56.408
And right now, I advise you
to get back onto the couch.

44:56.432 --> 44:58.106
Okay.

44:58.130 --> 45:00.262
All right. Carefully...

45:06.921 --> 45:08.357
Great.

45:10.751 --> 45:12.773
So I'm gonna go
back in the kitchen

45:12.797 --> 45:14.426
and make you your first meal.

45:14.450 --> 45:16.650
Not to mention, you are way
overdue for your medication.

45:38.997 --> 45:40.957
If you need anything else,
I'll be in the kitchen.

45:43.828 --> 45:45.090
Hey, Chloe?

45:47.179 --> 45:48.678
Look...

45:48.702 --> 45:50.767
I want you to know
that I'm sorry...

45:50.791 --> 45:52.488
if I was at all a
bit harsh with you.

45:54.882 --> 45:56.754
I appreciate
everything you said.

45:59.321 --> 46:01.560
And I'm more than
willing to keep you on.

46:01.584 --> 46:03.195
Can I go into the kitchen now?

46:04.892 --> 46:06.522
Uh...

46:06.546 --> 46:07.915
okay.

46:07.939 --> 46:08.983
Sure.

46:21.039 --> 46:24.322
Ugh. Typical Monday.
Eight reservations.

46:24.346 --> 46:25.976
Hey, Marco's not here tonight.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.022
Why don't you go home and
make dinner for your man?

46:28.046 --> 46:30.111
- Really?
- Yeah. I can cover around here.

46:30.135 --> 46:31.852
All right.

46:31.876 --> 46:32.964
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

46:49.894 --> 46:51.156
Honey?

46:52.722 --> 46:53.723
Lance?

46:56.726 --> 46:58.095
Lance?

46:58.119 --> 46:59.947
Lance!

47:01.079 --> 47:03.057
Lance, wake up!

47:03.081 --> 47:04.058
Wake up!

47:04.082 --> 47:05.015
Chloe!

47:05.039 --> 47:06.562
Call 911!

47:08.042 --> 47:10.412
Baby? Baby?

47:10.436 --> 47:11.436
God.

47:21.621 --> 47:24.295
And you have no idea how
long he was like that for?

47:24.319 --> 47:25.906
I mean, what were you doing?

47:25.930 --> 47:27.733
I was just doing laundry.

47:27.757 --> 47:29.561
I was in the other room. I'm...

47:29.585 --> 47:31.781
I know this is my fault.

47:31.805 --> 47:34.547
It's just that I have no idea
what could have happened to him.

47:37.593 --> 47:39.963
Bad reactions to drugs
happen all the time,

47:39.987 --> 47:41.660
so maybe the oxy
was just too much

47:41.684 --> 47:43.097
with his slight arrhythmia.

47:43.121 --> 47:44.707
Ms. Harmon?

47:44.731 --> 47:46.491
I'm sorry, we're just gonna have Ms.
Harmon

47:46.515 --> 47:48.450
come back right now.
You can follow me.

47:48.474 --> 47:51.583
I'm his nurse, so I should be fine
to go in and I'd like to see him.

47:51.607 --> 47:53.368
I understand, but I
have doctors' orders.

47:53.392 --> 47:54.717
No one else is gonna
be let in tonight.

47:54.741 --> 47:56.545
You should really go
home and get some rest.

47:56.569 --> 47:58.025
We'll take good care of him.
Come on.

47:58.049 --> 47:59.877
Could you call or
text me, please?

48:07.972 --> 48:10.080
Do you have any
idea what happened?

48:10.104 --> 48:12.517
How much oxycodone he took
in the last 24 hours?

48:12.541 --> 48:14.693
I don't know. The
amount he always takes.

48:14.717 --> 48:16.043
The amount he was prescribed.

48:16.067 --> 48:17.740
The tox report says otherwise.

48:17.764 --> 48:20.045
A normal dose couldn't have
caused what happened to Lance.

48:20.941 --> 48:22.310
Wait a second.

48:22.334 --> 48:24.834
Are you telling me that
Lance was poisoned?

48:24.858 --> 48:26.705
What I'm telling you is
that he's very lucky

48:26.729 --> 48:28.577
you showed up when you did.

48:28.601 --> 48:32.537
Look, the average person takes between
12 and 20 breaths per minute.

48:32.561 --> 48:33.841
When they wheeled Lance in here,

48:33.865 --> 48:36.019
his BPM was well below ten.

48:36.043 --> 48:37.934
He was on his way
to cardiac arrest.

48:37.958 --> 48:40.850
What I'd like to know is where his
nurse was during all of this.

48:40.874 --> 48:43.984
She was doing laundry
in the other room.

48:44.008 --> 48:46.725
Are you sure this
wasn't an accident?

48:46.749 --> 48:48.684
I just don't see how.

48:48.708 --> 48:51.034
Oh, my god.

48:51.058 --> 48:54.342
Listen, his doctor will be in
to speak with you shortly.

48:54.366 --> 48:55.933
You can go in.

49:04.028 --> 49:05.309
Lance?

49:05.333 --> 49:08.510
Hey. Hey, babe.

49:14.386 --> 49:16.127
This is like my second home.

49:18.433 --> 49:20.150
How are you feeling?

49:20.174 --> 49:21.959
Loopy.

49:23.482 --> 49:24.874
What happened?

49:26.485 --> 49:29.029
You OD'd on your drugs.

49:29.053 --> 49:30.726
What?

49:30.750 --> 49:33.120
Did Chloe give you any extra?

49:33.144 --> 49:35.035
Or did you take any extra?

49:35.059 --> 49:36.993
No.

49:37.017 --> 49:38.017
No.

49:39.977 --> 49:41.674
Well, do you remember anything?

49:44.155 --> 49:45.436
Not much.

49:45.460 --> 49:47.134
Just...

49:47.158 --> 49:49.005
I was trying to get some
work done on the couch

49:49.029 --> 49:52.443
and then I started to
feel groggy, and...

49:52.467 --> 49:54.880
I turned on the TV and then...

49:54.904 --> 49:56.819
and then I wake up here.

49:58.691 --> 50:00.190
Is it still Monday?

50:00.214 --> 50:01.607
It's Tuesday.

50:04.001 --> 50:05.393
Listen...

50:06.742 --> 50:08.851
Barb thinks that Chloe did it.

50:08.875 --> 50:10.616
What?

50:13.575 --> 50:16.380
I... is that what
the doctor said?

50:16.404 --> 50:17.971
That I was
purposefully poisoned?

50:19.625 --> 50:21.279
It looks that way. Yeah.

50:27.111 --> 50:28.329
Brooke...

50:30.853 --> 50:33.006
I haven't been totally
honest with you.

50:33.030 --> 50:35.747
Things haven't been going
as smoothly with Chloe

50:35.771 --> 50:36.771
as I lead you to believe.

50:39.732 --> 50:42.711
She made a pass at me.
She tried to kiss me

50:42.735 --> 50:44.800
and I... I pushed her
away and I sent her home.

50:44.824 --> 50:46.410
Why didn't you tell me?

50:46.434 --> 50:48.151
Because I felt bad.

50:48.175 --> 50:52.764
She seemed like she was about
to fall off the deep end and...

50:52.788 --> 50:55.289
And I knew that if I told you,
you would freak out about it.

50:55.313 --> 50:57.726
That's not the kind of thing
you keep from me, Lance.

50:57.750 --> 50:59.336
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

50:59.360 --> 51:00.622
I made a mistake.

51:03.277 --> 51:06.117
But you know, we just, we were just
talking about her guy problem and...

51:07.281 --> 51:09.562
I told her that she could do
better and she must have been

51:09.586 --> 51:12.175
crazy enough to think
that I meant myself.

51:12.199 --> 51:14.699
You're not supposed to
be her friend, Lance.

51:14.723 --> 51:16.788
She's your nurse.

51:16.812 --> 51:18.412
You can't even pee
without help from her.

51:18.436 --> 51:20.183
I mean, what were you thinking?

51:20.207 --> 51:22.055
You probably weren't thinking.

51:22.079 --> 51:25.493
You were probably just playing
your cutesy, handsome, charming,

51:25.517 --> 51:27.408
absent-minded
professor as usual.

51:27.432 --> 51:28.887
Brooke, that's not fair.

51:28.911 --> 51:31.064
I didn't want to cause
more problems in the event

51:31.088 --> 51:33.936
that it was just some silly,
conjured, isolated incident.

51:33.960 --> 51:36.025
Yeah. A silly, isolated incident

51:36.049 --> 51:38.593
incident that almost got
you killed... again.

51:38.617 --> 51:39.724
Brooke!

51:39.748 --> 51:41.030
Where are you going?

51:41.054 --> 51:42.403
To call the cops.

51:46.059 --> 51:49.367
Detective Thames, we need you to
come to the hospital right away.

51:51.543 --> 51:53.303
Well, how are we doing, Mr.
Boston?

51:53.327 --> 51:55.088
Okay, I guess.

51:55.112 --> 51:57.655
I've seen better days.

51:57.679 --> 52:00.223
So listen, your girlfriend
told me that you overdosed

52:00.247 --> 52:01.920
on this medication
you've been on

52:01.944 --> 52:04.227
and that made me very concerned
about this nurse of yours.

52:04.251 --> 52:06.011
Chloe Spade?

52:06.035 --> 52:08.753
I don't know if either
of you know this,

52:08.777 --> 52:10.842
but Ms. Spade is
manic depressive.

52:10.866 --> 52:13.802
Well, we knew she was on
medication, so we kind of figured.

52:13.826 --> 52:15.586
Yeah. Well, this
isn't the first time

52:15.610 --> 52:17.250
she's had issues with
one of her patients.

52:17.274 --> 52:18.850
Oh, so she tried to
kill someone else?

52:18.874 --> 52:20.354
No, no. But...

52:21.790 --> 52:25.074
Well, this previous patient
a few years back, um,

52:25.098 --> 52:27.163
he was a successful
actor in Brentwood,

52:27.187 --> 52:29.339
injured himself on set,
couldn't walk, and...

52:29.363 --> 52:32.105
they became involved.

52:33.498 --> 52:35.867
When Ms. Spade found out
that he was married,

52:35.891 --> 52:38.329
his wife was in Canada working
on another film, um...

52:40.287 --> 52:41.830
she went crazy.

52:41.854 --> 52:45.268
Uh... destroyed the house,
left the guy helpless

52:45.292 --> 52:47.468
and immobile without
food or a phone.

52:49.078 --> 52:51.361
- But she didn't try to murder him?
- Well, technically.

52:51.385 --> 52:53.537
But it's negligence
all the same.

52:53.561 --> 52:55.601
I mean, it was just virtue
of the fact that they guy

52:55.625 --> 52:58.586
decided to drop the charges she
hooked on with another contractor.

52:58.610 --> 53:00.762
But you know, given her history,

53:00.786 --> 53:03.504
her dad's abuse, her illness,

53:03.528 --> 53:06.463
the drug cocktails
she's taken...

53:06.487 --> 53:07.943
it's bad.

53:07.967 --> 53:09.858
Well, how is she even
able to nurse still?

53:09.882 --> 53:12.382
I... I don't know.
We're working on that.

53:12.406 --> 53:14.887
Okay, and how can we be sure
that she wanted to kill me?

53:16.193 --> 53:18.083
I mean, she's a nurse, right?

53:18.107 --> 53:19.955
She knows what it takes
to kill somebody,

53:19.979 --> 53:21.913
so if she wanted me
dead, I'd be dead.

53:21.937 --> 53:24.089
So...

53:24.113 --> 53:26.788
maybe she wanted to be heard?

53:26.812 --> 53:28.790
Or... maybe she was just pissed?

53:28.814 --> 53:31.271
It doesn't change
what she did, Lance.

53:31.295 --> 53:32.881
I mean, you could have died!

53:32.905 --> 53:35.231
She shouldn't be anyone's
nurse if she's crazy!

53:35.255 --> 53:38.582
You're right... but I'm not sure

53:38.606 --> 53:41.281
I want to press charges either.

53:41.305 --> 53:44.022
I mean... Chloe needs
to be in a hospital,

53:44.046 --> 53:45.415
not in some jail cell.

53:45.439 --> 53:47.635
Look, the doctor would
probably suggest rehab,

53:47.659 --> 53:49.680
but I doubt very much that Ms.
Spade would admit to anything.

53:49.704 --> 53:51.291
And in the way that she
administered your drugs,

53:51.315 --> 53:53.031
the doctor wasn't even
sure of her intent.

53:53.055 --> 53:55.033
So it's time for you
to get another nurse.

53:55.057 --> 53:56.777
In the meantime, I'm
going to look into this

53:56.801 --> 53:58.841
a little bit further, and
if you hear anything else,

53:58.865 --> 54:00.300
you guys call me right away.

54:00.324 --> 54:03.172
- And get out of this bed.
- Thanks, Detective.

54:03.196 --> 54:04.596
- Thank you.
- All right. Take care.

54:15.817 --> 54:17.317
Oh, Brooke!

54:17.341 --> 54:18.907
How is he? How's Lance?

54:23.303 --> 54:25.194
You don't have to worry.

54:25.218 --> 54:26.717
We decided not to press charges.

54:26.741 --> 54:28.197
Press charges?

54:28.221 --> 54:29.503
For what?

54:29.527 --> 54:31.093
Don't make this
harder than it is.

54:32.791 --> 54:34.334
The oxy.

54:34.358 --> 54:36.534
We know you tried to OD him.

54:38.405 --> 54:40.035
No! What?

54:40.059 --> 54:41.979
I gave him the same amount
I've always given him.

54:42.003 --> 54:43.283
The amount that he's prescribed.

54:43.307 --> 54:44.801
It's in his report, Chloe.

54:46.370 --> 54:47.956
Brooke, I didn't do this.

54:47.980 --> 54:50.025
Is this like that
actor in Brentwood?

54:52.114 --> 54:53.115
Oh, my...

54:55.379 --> 54:59.272
That... I was not
in my right mind.

54:59.296 --> 55:00.969
Are you ever in your right mind?

55:00.993 --> 55:02.953
Or are you just utterly and
completely delusional?

55:04.344 --> 55:06.496
Our attorney has
called your contractor

55:06.520 --> 55:08.080
and let them know that
we will no longer

55:08.104 --> 55:09.282
be needing your services.

55:09.306 --> 55:10.370
You're fired.

55:10.394 --> 55:12.459
No. No, no. Don't do this.

55:12.483 --> 55:14.591
No, no. I... I didn't
do anything wrong.

55:14.615 --> 55:16.550
Between making passes
at my boyfriend

55:16.574 --> 55:18.094
and then almost killing
him with drugs,

55:18.118 --> 55:19.422
I disagree.

55:19.446 --> 55:22.797
This... this can't
be happening again.

55:25.409 --> 55:28.605
Chloe look, I should hate you

55:28.629 --> 55:30.781
for what you did, but I don't.

55:30.805 --> 55:33.567
I know you haven't
had an easy life,

55:33.591 --> 55:35.786
but you need to seek
professional help.

55:35.810 --> 55:38.485
The staff here is
willing to help you.

55:38.509 --> 55:41.401
No. I am not going
to rehab again.

55:41.425 --> 55:42.489
Fine.

55:42.513 --> 55:45.318
But you're not fit to nurse.

55:45.342 --> 55:47.581
Okay.

55:47.605 --> 55:51.193
Let me just... let me
just go see Lance, okay?

55:51.217 --> 55:52.657
Let me just tell him goodbye.
Please?

55:52.681 --> 55:54.030
Absolutely not.

55:57.223 --> 55:58.442
Fine.

56:05.971 --> 56:09.385
You know, if you guys were
so perfect for each other,

56:09.409 --> 56:11.019
why haven't you married him yet?

56:13.370 --> 56:14.956
It's people like you, Brooke,

56:14.980 --> 56:16.479
who have the world
handed to them

56:16.503 --> 56:18.829
on a silver platter,
taking every single thing

56:18.853 --> 56:21.595
for granted, who
deserve nothing.

56:30.038 --> 56:32.669
This is Lance. Leave a
message at the [beep]

56:32.693 --> 56:34.541
Lance, hi. It's Chloe.

56:34.565 --> 56:37.326
Listen, um, can you just call me
as soon as you get this, please?

56:37.350 --> 56:39.510
You have to know I would never
do anything to hurt you.

56:42.529 --> 56:44.139
I love you, okay?

56:46.446 --> 56:49.841
I know you're with Brooke, but please,
I just need you to call me, okay?

57:21.002 --> 57:22.351
What do you want?

57:24.353 --> 57:26.225
Chloe, I know it's you.

57:43.938 --> 57:46.221
Wow, she really wants
to talk to you.

57:46.245 --> 57:47.918
I guess you guys really bonded.

57:47.942 --> 57:50.443
What, between the Thai food and
her helping you urinate...

57:50.467 --> 57:51.748
Come on, Brooke.

57:51.772 --> 57:52.923
You know nothing happened.

57:52.947 --> 57:54.035
Do I?

57:56.037 --> 57:58.276
I thought we trusted each other.

57:58.300 --> 57:59.780
So did I.

58:02.174 --> 58:03.630
Now where are you going?

58:03.654 --> 58:05.153
If we're gonna get stuck
here another night,

58:05.177 --> 58:06.850
then I need to go home
and take a shower

58:06.874 --> 58:08.074
and get us some fresh clothes.

58:08.098 --> 58:09.549
Brooke!

58:09.573 --> 58:11.488
Don't leave like this.

58:15.579 --> 58:16.991
Get some rest.

58:17.015 --> 58:18.190
I'll be back later.

01:00:07.342 --> 01:00:08.711
Chloe!

01:00:08.735 --> 01:00:10.191
You better get out of here!

01:00:10.215 --> 01:00:11.782
I'm two seconds from
calling the police!

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:38.611
Do you know if she
was admitted yet?

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:41.091
Excuse me, I have a
delivery for Lance Boston.

01:00:41.115 --> 01:00:42.440
Do you know which room he's in?

01:00:42.464 --> 01:00:44.007
Thanks. You can
just leave it here.

01:00:44.031 --> 01:00:46.096
We'll make sure he gets it.

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:48.760
Oh. I promised the courier that I
would deliver it to him directly.

01:00:48.784 --> 01:00:50.090
What floor do you work on?

01:00:51.386 --> 01:00:53.060
First floor check-in.

01:00:53.084 --> 01:00:54.884
I didn't know we had any
new hires down there.

01:00:54.908 --> 01:00:56.127
What's your name, Miss?

01:00:59.351 --> 01:01:01.658
Just make sure Lance
Boston gets these, please.

01:01:07.446 --> 01:01:09.206
I want to throw up.

01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:11.295
I'm so sorry.

01:01:11.319 --> 01:01:12.775
It's not your fault, Barb.

01:01:12.799 --> 01:01:14.124
The hospital needs to figure out

01:01:14.148 --> 01:01:15.668
a better system to
screen these people.

01:01:15.692 --> 01:01:17.475
I agree.

01:01:17.499 --> 01:01:21.001
Listen, I have a bunch of
vacation days stockpiled.

01:01:21.025 --> 01:01:22.567
I'll take care of Lance.

01:01:22.591 --> 01:01:24.047
Oh, that's so sweet.

01:01:24.071 --> 01:01:25.875
But we couldn't ask
you to do that, Barb.

01:01:25.899 --> 01:01:27.268
I'm not asking.

01:01:27.292 --> 01:01:29.009
I'm telling.

01:01:29.033 --> 01:01:30.687
Can't argue with that, babe.

01:01:39.957 --> 01:01:41.369
Thanks a lot.

01:01:41.393 --> 01:01:43.588
All right, you ready
to get out of here

01:01:43.612 --> 01:01:45.808
once and for all?

01:01:45.832 --> 01:01:48.752
Aw, but I was finally getting used to
the bedspring prodding my sphincter.

01:01:48.776 --> 01:01:49.682
Hi!

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:50.866
Getting out on good behavior?

01:01:50.890 --> 01:01:52.685
Yeah.

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:55.109
The doctor says he thinks he'd
be better off resting at home.

01:01:55.133 --> 01:01:57.907
I'm just a little bit concerned
about Chloe making an appearance.

01:01:57.931 --> 01:02:00.910
Well, the good news is besides
filing the restraining order,

01:02:00.934 --> 01:02:03.054
I also put in a call in to
her staffing administration

01:02:03.078 --> 01:02:05.360
to make sure that she does
not do this to anyone again.

01:02:05.384 --> 01:02:06.699
Amen.

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:08.443
You did change the locks
in your house, yes?

01:02:08.467 --> 01:02:09.832
- Of course.
- Good.

01:02:09.856 --> 01:02:12.096
Now, I don't want you guys to
worry about anything, okay?

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.445
But just do not
encourage her behavior.

01:02:14.469 --> 01:02:16.360
Don't answer her phone
calls, her text messages,

01:02:16.384 --> 01:02:17.448
her e-mails... Nothing.

01:02:17.472 --> 01:02:19.886
And she's gonna go away, okay?

01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:22.870
All right, I have another client here
to see, but you guys take care, okay?

01:02:22.894 --> 01:02:25.026
You, too. Thanks, Gwen.

01:02:30.268 --> 01:02:32.072
No. Monday is a no-go.

01:02:32.096 --> 01:02:33.726
No. I have lunch with
Brilstein at noon,

01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:35.249
and then I'm going dress
shopping with my sister after.

01:02:35.273 --> 01:02:36.903
I'm not gonna cancel
on her again.

01:02:36.927 --> 01:02:37.991
Okay.

01:02:38.015 --> 01:02:39.688
Okay. Yes.

01:02:39.712 --> 01:02:41.232
I have a hot date
tonight with a bottle

01:02:41.256 --> 01:02:42.952
of chardonnay in
my bed, goodnight.

01:02:42.976 --> 01:02:44.562
You can't take my
job away from me.

01:02:44.586 --> 01:02:46.782
Nursing is the
only thing I love.

01:02:46.806 --> 01:02:48.784
Oh, well then you shouldn't
be so awful at it.

01:02:48.808 --> 01:02:50.046
I'm calling the police.

01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:51.158
What are you doing?

01:03:11.613 --> 01:03:13.113
Hello?

01:03:13.137 --> 01:03:14.679
Brooke, it's Connie.

01:03:14.703 --> 01:03:16.507
Gwen's been attacked.
She's in the hospital.

01:03:16.531 --> 01:03:17.857
What?

01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:19.902
It's serious. She's
not waking up.

01:03:19.926 --> 01:03:21.798
- Brooke, she's not waking up!
- Babe... babe.

01:03:23.147 --> 01:03:24.496
Oh, my god.

01:03:30.937 --> 01:03:32.852
You don't think it could've
been Chloe, do you?

01:03:38.902 --> 01:03:40.270
I don't know.

01:03:40.294 --> 01:03:42.427
I mean, would Chloe
even know who Gwen is?

01:03:44.168 --> 01:03:45.362
They never met.

01:03:45.386 --> 01:03:46.973
I don't know.

01:03:46.997 --> 01:03:49.366
It just seems like a
weird coincidence.

01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:50.411
Yeah.

01:03:50.435 --> 01:03:53.414
Now she's in coma.

01:03:53.438 --> 01:03:54.958
I was thinking about
going to visit her

01:03:54.982 --> 01:03:57.022
in the hospital after the
fundraiser tomorrow night.

01:03:57.046 --> 01:03:58.331
You should.

01:04:02.751 --> 01:04:04.642
I'm sorry.

01:04:04.666 --> 01:04:06.190
For what?

01:04:07.713 --> 01:04:09.647
I haven't been the
best girlfriend.

01:04:09.671 --> 01:04:11.954
Brooke...

01:04:11.978 --> 01:04:13.545
I'm always putting myself first.

01:04:15.286 --> 01:04:17.486
If there's anything good that's
come out of all of this,

01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:19.510
it's that I realize I could
never live without you.

01:04:19.534 --> 01:04:20.528
Babe...

01:04:20.552 --> 01:04:22.293
if anyone should apologize,
it should be me.

01:04:24.295 --> 01:04:25.644
I should've told you.

01:04:27.646 --> 01:04:28.797
I don't know why I didn't.

01:04:28.821 --> 01:04:29.821
I just...

01:04:31.824 --> 01:04:33.086
I'm sorry.

01:04:41.312 --> 01:04:42.942
I'm sorry I said
I wanted to wait

01:04:42.966 --> 01:04:44.489
when you asked me to marry you.

01:04:45.969 --> 01:04:47.947
I wanted to.

01:04:47.971 --> 01:04:50.079
I guess I just thought that...

01:04:50.103 --> 01:04:52.192
we could wait until we
had more money or...

01:04:53.759 --> 01:04:54.954
more time.

01:04:54.978 --> 01:04:57.086
I know.

01:04:57.110 --> 01:04:59.417
But we don't always
get more time, do we?

01:05:02.028 --> 01:05:03.136
I love you.

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.683
I love you, too.

01:05:10.167 --> 01:05:12.212
All right. Eat up.

01:05:21.047 --> 01:05:23.808
And I can't get in to see
him sooner than that, huh?

01:05:23.832 --> 01:05:26.159
Because...

01:05:26.183 --> 01:05:28.335
something is wrong
with my pills and...

01:05:28.359 --> 01:05:29.858
they're not working.

01:05:29.882 --> 01:05:31.884
I need something
stronger, you know?

01:05:33.668 --> 01:05:35.429
Next Monday.

01:05:35.453 --> 01:05:37.020
Okay. Great. Thanks.

01:05:55.386 --> 01:05:57.930
Boy do I have a treat for you.

01:05:57.954 --> 01:05:59.888
Cookies?

01:05:59.912 --> 01:06:03.109
Rumor has it you
have a sweet tooth.

01:06:03.133 --> 01:06:05.154
Ms. Harmon tipped me off.

01:06:05.178 --> 01:06:07.026
You know, she's not
much of a baker.

01:06:07.050 --> 01:06:08.766
She's much more into the savory,

01:06:08.790 --> 01:06:11.315
which is probably good for me,
'cause if she was, I'd be fat.

01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:16.905
This was my mother's recipe.

01:06:16.929 --> 01:06:19.038
Even after she got
sick with Alzheimer's,

01:06:19.062 --> 01:06:20.822
she didn't miss a
beat in the kitchen.

01:06:20.846 --> 01:06:23.246
I think she believed that good
cooking was the best medicine.

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:26.421
Well, it must have
been hard, though.

01:06:27.896 --> 01:06:29.570
Yeah.

01:06:29.594 --> 01:06:31.528
You know what they say...

01:06:31.552 --> 01:06:34.575
If it doesn't kill you,
it makes you stronger.

01:06:34.599 --> 01:06:37.795
I think it's what made
me the nurse I am today.

01:06:37.819 --> 01:06:40.059
A damn good one, from
what I can tell.

01:06:40.083 --> 01:06:42.148
Thank you for that.

01:06:42.172 --> 01:06:44.063
And speaking of which,
how's the new patient?

01:06:44.087 --> 01:06:46.239
Is Gwen gonna be okay?

01:06:46.263 --> 01:06:48.284
I heard she was
doing really well.

01:06:48.308 --> 01:06:50.373
She's expected to
make a full recovery.

01:06:50.397 --> 01:06:51.722
That is great.

01:06:51.746 --> 01:06:53.313
Yeah. She got lucky.

01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:56.640
You expecting company?

01:06:56.664 --> 01:06:58.947
No.

01:06:58.971 --> 01:07:00.557
Well, let's see who it is.

01:07:00.581 --> 01:07:01.930
Coming!

01:07:03.976 --> 01:07:05.127
What are you doing here?

01:07:05.151 --> 01:07:07.216
I came to see Lance.

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:09.088
You're not welcome here, Ms.
Spade.

01:07:09.112 --> 01:07:10.504
- Lance!
- Hold on.

01:07:12.506 --> 01:07:13.507
Lance.

01:07:14.856 --> 01:07:16.225
I've been so worried about you.

01:07:16.249 --> 01:07:17.849
I don't know what
happened the other day,

01:07:17.873 --> 01:07:20.577
but I swear to you, I
didn't poison you.

01:07:20.601 --> 01:07:23.711
Look Chloe, the police
are looking for you.

01:07:23.735 --> 01:07:25.800
You need to check yourself in

01:07:25.824 --> 01:07:27.628
and get yourself some
real help now, okay?

01:07:27.652 --> 01:07:29.543
I'm here to help you.

01:07:29.567 --> 01:07:32.372
I want to work for you again.
Please.

01:07:32.396 --> 01:07:34.833
I think he's made himself
perfectly clear.

01:07:36.487 --> 01:07:38.334
I'm supposed to be his nurse!

01:07:38.358 --> 01:07:39.881
Not anymore you're not.

01:08:24.404 --> 01:08:26.339
And she didn't say
anything else?

01:08:26.363 --> 01:08:27.774
No.

01:08:27.799 --> 01:08:29.639
She didn't try to force
herself in or anything.

01:08:29.662 --> 01:08:31.474
She just left.

01:08:31.497 --> 01:08:33.737
This is just getting
so out of hand.

01:08:33.761 --> 01:08:36.000
What did the detective say?

01:08:36.024 --> 01:08:38.090
Just that they're still
looking for her.

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:39.961
Well, that's reassuring.

01:08:39.984 --> 01:08:43.380
Brooke, baby... relax.

01:08:44.772 --> 01:08:46.470
The police are
taking care of it.

01:08:48.776 --> 01:08:50.667
Trust me...

01:08:50.691 --> 01:08:52.779
everything's gonna be fine.

01:09:05.792 --> 01:09:08.120
Chloe Spade! This is
Detective Thames!

01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:09.424
Can you open up
the door, please?

01:09:12.322 --> 01:09:14.952
We have a warrant to
search the premises!

01:09:14.975 --> 01:09:17.041
I'm gonna need you to
open the door, ma'am!

01:09:17.064 --> 01:09:18.589
Ms. Spade!

01:09:52.144 --> 01:09:53.189
Hello?

01:09:54.384 --> 01:09:55.384
Hey, Barb.

01:09:55.408 --> 01:09:57.038
Listen...

01:09:57.062 --> 01:10:00.172
I'm not supposed to
share this with anyone,

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:02.435
but I think you should know.

01:10:02.459 --> 01:10:05.288
Last night, Ms. Spade was
admitted to the hospital.

01:10:06.463 --> 01:10:08.267
Seriously? What for?

01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:09.920
Apparently she tried
to commit suicide.

01:10:09.944 --> 01:10:11.487
The cops found her.

01:10:11.511 --> 01:10:13.968
She took a lethal dose of
oxy, which I can only imagine

01:10:13.992 --> 01:10:15.883
came from Lance's prescription.

01:10:15.907 --> 01:10:18.842
Uh... Chloe tried to
kill herself last night.

01:10:18.866 --> 01:10:20.235
- She's in the hospital.
- What?

01:10:20.259 --> 01:10:21.628
How is she doing?

01:10:21.652 --> 01:10:23.238
Well, she's stable.

01:10:23.262 --> 01:10:26.198
The bigger question is whether
the doctor admits her

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:27.721
to a psychiatric
hospital or not.

01:10:27.745 --> 01:10:29.288
My guess is that
he probably will,

01:10:29.312 --> 01:10:30.811
but she's got at
least 24 hours here.

01:10:30.835 --> 01:10:32.116
I thought you should know.

01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:34.510
Okay. Please keep us updated.

01:10:34.534 --> 01:10:35.753
You bet.

01:10:38.059 --> 01:10:40.299
This is insane.

01:10:40.323 --> 01:10:42.281
Chloe tried to kill herself?

01:10:45.197 --> 01:10:47.610
I think she must have felt
some serious guilt...

01:10:47.634 --> 01:10:49.419
after what she'd done to us.

01:10:51.327 --> 01:10:53.007
Maybe it all just finally
caught up to her.

01:10:53.031 --> 01:10:54.250
Yeah. Maybe.

01:10:55.468 --> 01:10:56.924
I'm just glad they found her.

01:10:56.948 --> 01:10:58.508
I hope she gets committed
somewhere soon

01:10:58.532 --> 01:11:00.014
so she can't get near us again.

01:11:00.038 --> 01:11:01.711
Yeah.

01:11:01.735 --> 01:11:03.824
Yeah. Me, too.

01:11:17.011 --> 01:11:18.250
Hey.

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:20.164
How's it goin'?

01:11:20.188 --> 01:11:22.036
Chloe's in the hospital.

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:24.343
She tried to kill
herself last night.

01:11:24.367 --> 01:11:25.779
They're gonna hold her.

01:11:25.803 --> 01:11:27.643
Hopefully they'll finally
commit her this time.

01:11:27.667 --> 01:11:29.435
Well, that's exactly
what she needs.

01:11:29.459 --> 01:11:32.612
Yeah. I'm just glad that I can
leave Lance at home and not worry.

01:11:32.636 --> 01:11:34.788
Nice to finally have
your life back, right?

01:11:34.812 --> 01:11:35.943
Oh, yeah.

01:11:44.474 --> 01:11:45.929
Paul?

01:11:45.953 --> 01:11:47.670
Hey, Barb.

01:11:47.694 --> 01:11:50.891
Dr. Floyd just got the order to
prep Chloe Spade for transport.

01:11:50.915 --> 01:11:53.633
- Wait. That's tonight?
- Apparently so.

01:11:53.657 --> 01:11:55.659
All right. I'll get on it.

01:12:05.712 --> 01:12:07.777
And how are we feeling, dear?

01:12:07.801 --> 01:12:09.388
We're alone.

01:12:09.412 --> 01:12:11.477
You can drop the
holier-than-thou act.

01:12:11.501 --> 01:12:13.348
Well, fine.

01:12:13.372 --> 01:12:15.394
Since we're sharing
our true feelings,

01:12:15.418 --> 01:12:18.353
I have to tell you, I'm a bit
disappointed in you, Chloe...

01:12:18.377 --> 01:12:21.859
Trying to check out of the
job I paid you to do.

01:12:25.210 --> 01:12:28.929
But then I realized,
it's partially my fault,

01:12:28.953 --> 01:12:31.801
what, with the placebo
pills and all.

01:12:31.825 --> 01:12:34.369
Placebo?

01:12:34.393 --> 01:12:36.917
The ones I replaced your
anti-depressants with.

01:12:38.789 --> 01:12:40.810
You gave me placebos?

01:12:40.834 --> 01:12:43.552
Well, I had to tip
the scales somehow.

01:12:43.576 --> 01:12:45.097
God.

01:12:45.109 --> 01:12:46.642
Your sex appeal wasn't
doing it on its own.

01:12:46.666 --> 01:12:47.904
That's why I was so messed up.

01:12:47.928 --> 01:12:49.602
You bitch!

01:12:49.626 --> 01:12:51.821
Such language.

01:12:51.845 --> 01:12:53.910
We were only supposed
to mess with them.

01:12:53.934 --> 01:12:55.695
I could go to jail for
attempted murder!

01:12:55.719 --> 01:12:57.523
You could go to jail for murder.

01:12:57.547 --> 01:12:58.785
What?

01:12:58.809 --> 01:13:00.656
Don't worry.

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:03.659
I'm gonna make absolutely
sure you don't go to jail.

01:13:03.683 --> 01:13:06.183
Don't do me any
favors, all right?

01:13:06.207 --> 01:13:07.687
I made up my mind.
When the cops come,

01:13:07.711 --> 01:13:08.601
I'm telling them everything.

01:13:08.625 --> 01:13:10.623
No, no, no.

01:13:10.647 --> 01:13:13.103
Just let me do my job.

01:13:13.127 --> 01:13:14.931
And what does that mean?

01:13:14.955 --> 01:13:17.456
I'm the best nurse
in this hospital.

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:19.893
Just let me make it all better.

01:13:19.917 --> 01:13:21.503
Just like I always do.

01:13:21.527 --> 01:13:22.939
I want nothing to do with this.

01:13:22.963 --> 01:13:24.114
Do you understand? I'm out.

01:13:24.138 --> 01:13:25.551
Oh, I know.

01:13:25.575 --> 01:13:27.379
Last night when they
brought you in here,

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:29.990
I realized that you gave
me the perfect opportunity

01:13:30.014 --> 01:13:34.061
to clean this whole thing
up nice and neat...

01:13:36.542 --> 01:13:38.302
just like I did with James.

01:13:38.326 --> 01:13:39.632
James?

01:13:41.068 --> 01:13:42.698
What did you to to J...

01:13:42.722 --> 01:13:44.071
What the...

01:14:37.298 --> 01:14:39.344
Now the big guy
comes up to bat...

01:14:49.267 --> 01:14:52.638
I really am sorry
about this, Chloe,

01:14:52.662 --> 01:14:54.944
but I've seen so
many girls like you.

01:14:54.968 --> 01:14:58.450
Trust me, you weren't
gonna get any better.

01:15:15.206 --> 01:15:16.947
The first pitch...

01:15:27.218 --> 01:15:28.543
Surprise!

01:15:28.567 --> 01:15:30.414
Barb! Hey.

01:15:30.438 --> 01:15:32.025
Is everything okay?

01:15:32.049 --> 01:15:34.157
I just wanted to
check in on you.

01:15:34.181 --> 01:15:35.541
I'll just put these
in the kitchen.

01:15:35.565 --> 01:15:37.698
Oh! Well, that's very...
sweet of you.

01:15:42.059 --> 01:15:44.472
It is so sweet how he
likes to rub my feet

01:15:44.496 --> 01:15:47.823
at the end of the day,
but they're so sweaty.

01:15:47.847 --> 01:15:51.305
I've been in these freaking
shoes for 12 hours.

01:15:51.329 --> 01:15:52.480
- Marry him.
- Yeah.

01:15:52.504 --> 01:15:53.766
Hold on.

01:15:57.335 --> 01:15:59.356
- This is Brooke Harmon.
- Hi, Brooke.

01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:01.402
This is Eric, Darren
Wells's brother?

01:16:01.426 --> 01:16:03.622
- Well hello.
- I'm sorry to call you like this,

01:16:03.646 --> 01:16:05.624
but I really need to warn you.

01:16:05.648 --> 01:16:08.844
Your nurse Barbara... she
isn't who she says she is.

01:16:08.868 --> 01:16:10.174
Wait. What did you say?

01:16:19.009 --> 01:16:20.706
Cookies were delicious.

01:16:22.099 --> 01:16:24.904
I really appreciate you
stopping by, Barb.

01:16:24.928 --> 01:16:28.148
I am just all of a
sudden exhausted.

01:16:30.237 --> 01:16:32.370
I think I'm just gonna crash.

01:16:34.328 --> 01:16:38.482
That's because I put something
extra special in these cookies.

01:16:38.506 --> 01:16:40.702
Excuse me?

01:16:40.726 --> 01:16:43.749
You didn't think you were gonna
get away with it, did you?

01:16:43.773 --> 01:16:45.751
What?

01:16:45.775 --> 01:16:47.840
Killing him.

01:16:47.864 --> 01:16:49.842
Darren.

01:16:49.866 --> 01:16:51.060
What are you talking about?

01:16:51.084 --> 01:16:53.454
The man you ran over.

01:16:53.478 --> 01:16:57.066
Left in the street bloody.

01:16:57.090 --> 01:16:58.459
That was my fiancée...

01:16:58.483 --> 01:17:00.616
Darren Wells.

01:17:11.104 --> 01:17:13.213
Barb...

01:17:13.237 --> 01:17:16.956
whatever pain we've caused
you, we've already paid for it

01:17:16.980 --> 01:17:19.591
tenfold with everything Chloe
put us through already.

01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:25.704
Chloe works for me.

01:17:25.728 --> 01:17:28.315
I paid her to take care of you.

01:17:28.339 --> 01:17:31.579
You paid Chloe to
try to kill me?

01:17:31.603 --> 01:17:33.102
Nah.

01:17:33.126 --> 01:17:34.756
No, no.

01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:37.391
She's much too much
of a coward for that.

01:17:38.958 --> 01:17:40.719
I paid her to ruin your life

01:17:40.743 --> 01:17:42.396
like you ruined mine.

01:17:43.789 --> 01:17:45.356
I'm the one that made you OD.

01:17:46.705 --> 01:17:48.620
I'm the one that
wants to kill you.

01:17:49.795 --> 01:17:52.165
And this time...

01:17:52.189 --> 01:17:53.906
I'm not gonna fail.

01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:55.472
Barb...

01:17:55.496 --> 01:17:57.934
Go to your happy place, Lance.

01:17:59.805 --> 01:18:02.199
That would be right
here with me, bitch.

01:18:09.032 --> 01:18:11.140
I can't feel anything.

01:18:11.164 --> 01:18:12.751
Now where were we?

01:18:12.775 --> 01:18:14.578
What did you do to me?

01:18:14.602 --> 01:18:17.538
- You don't have to do this!
- Back away from him, Barb!

01:18:17.562 --> 01:18:19.042
Honey, you got to be kidding me.

01:18:20.565 --> 01:18:22.151
Okay...

01:18:22.175 --> 01:18:24.153
Take it easy, Chloe.

01:18:24.177 --> 01:18:27.113
If you help me out, I
can give you double.

01:18:27.137 --> 01:18:28.636
I'm not interested.

01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:30.638
You sure?

01:18:30.662 --> 01:18:34.274
You could do a whole
lot with $5,000.

01:18:36.102 --> 01:18:37.253
No!

01:18:37.277 --> 01:18:39.715
Barb! Get off, Barb!

01:18:45.329 --> 01:18:47.350
Barb, stop it!

01:18:47.374 --> 01:18:49.265
Barb! Barb, please!

01:18:49.289 --> 01:18:50.943
No!

01:19:12.704 --> 01:19:15.030
- Oh...
- Honey.

01:19:15.054 --> 01:19:16.447
Is she dead?

01:19:17.970 --> 01:19:19.319
How did you know?

01:19:20.843 --> 01:19:23.082
- I sent a card to Darren Wells's brother.
- What?

01:19:23.106 --> 01:19:27.695
He called me and he said that Darren
was engaged to a nurse named Barb.

01:19:27.719 --> 01:19:29.436
Oh.

01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:31.244
I'm so glad you're okay.

01:19:34.073 --> 01:19:36.965
My hero.

01:19:36.989 --> 01:19:39.751
Babe, it's over.

01:19:39.775 --> 01:19:41.796
- It's over.
- It's over.

01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:43.972
What about Chloe?

01:19:43.996 --> 01:19:45.345
Let's get her some help.

01:19:55.878 --> 01:19:59.553
The first drink
I've had in ages.

01:19:59.577 --> 01:20:01.033
So good.

01:20:01.057 --> 01:20:02.382
Cheers.

01:20:02.406 --> 01:20:03.470
Cheers!

01:20:03.494 --> 01:20:06.236
Oh! And I got you...

01:20:07.411 --> 01:20:08.780
Mm!

01:20:08.804 --> 01:20:10.520
Salted caramel cake?

01:20:10.544 --> 01:20:12.198
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

01:20:15.636 --> 01:20:17.813
Thought it was about
time that I asked again.

01:20:20.946 --> 01:20:23.906
Might be a little hard for me to get
down on one knee at the moment, but...

01:20:27.605 --> 01:20:29.801
Well, I was actually
thinking that

01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:31.585
since I said no the first time,

01:20:31.609 --> 01:20:33.698
I should be the one to ask you.

01:20:38.442 --> 01:20:40.139
Lance...

01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:44.361
will you marry me?

01:20:49.105 --> 01:20:50.715
It's about damn time.

01:20:57.200 --> 01:21:00.005
- So is that a yes?
- Yes! That is a yes.

01:21:00.029 --> 01:21:01.615
Okay. Good.

01:21:01.639 --> 01:21:04.052
- Does it fit?
- Let's see.

01:21:04.076 --> 01:21:05.948
Let's put in on. Ah!
