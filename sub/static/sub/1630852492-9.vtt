of nathan jr..

00:04.038 --> 00:05.771
- You're kidding, right?
- I hope you don't mind

00:05.840 --> 00:08.440
That I picked nathan jr. Up
from school today.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.709
- I convinced the board
to reissue

00:10.711 --> 00:12.778
"the raccoon and the rock."
- what?

00:12.847 --> 00:14.546
- I wanna get this right,
jenny.

00:14.582 --> 00:17.115
- Your pregnancy is high-risk.
- No, it's not.

00:17.184 --> 00:18.917
- Jesus, lionel,

00:18.919 --> 00:20.786
What is going on with us?
- (sighs)

00:20.855 --> 00:22.187
- Wait, are you hiding
something?

00:23.824 --> 00:25.824
- What are you doing here?
- Is annie here?

00:25.826 --> 00:27.459
- No! No thank you!
(door slams)

00:27.495 --> 00:29.795
- You released some chapters.
- The cat's out of the bag.

00:29.930 --> 00:32.097
- Big mistake. Huge.

00:33.934 --> 00:36.734
- Now, with pinworm season
on the horizon,

00:36.771 --> 00:39.605
I thought it only appropriate
we talk about our fears.

00:41.008 --> 00:43.442
Joseph and jacob: Mom? Mom? Oh!
- Oh god.

00:43.444 --> 00:45.277
- Joseph, jacob?
What are you--

00:45.279 --> 00:47.345
- We know we're supposed
to register and shit,

00:47.381 --> 00:50.248
But can crystal join
your little group?

00:51.385 --> 00:53.051
- Who is she?
- Oh, just our girlfriend!

00:53.054 --> 00:55.788
- "our?"
- yeah! Full of our seed.

00:55.923 --> 00:57.222
- Mm-hmm.
- What?

00:57.224 --> 00:59.091
- Val, I think they're
trying to tell you

00:59.093 --> 01:00.992
That you're gonna be a grandma.
- Oh wait,

01:01.062 --> 01:03.027
Which one of you is the father?
- Oh, we don't know.

01:04.065 --> 01:06.264
- What?!
- Hang on a second.

01:06.266 --> 01:08.033
How does this work, exactly?

01:08.102 --> 01:10.235
- Is this like a threesome
situation?

01:10.237 --> 01:12.170
- He's my brother! Gross!

01:12.239 --> 01:14.339
- Maya, don't pull back
the veil on this.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.541
- So...

01:16.577 --> 01:19.043
She can join?

01:19.180 --> 01:20.512
- (inhales deeply)

01:21.782 --> 01:23.982
Of course,
the more the merrier.

01:23.984 --> 01:25.850
Crystal, jacob: Exactly! Nice!
Val: Unbelievable.

01:25.886 --> 01:27.719
- My dudes, please treat
crystal here like

01:27.721 --> 01:29.788
You would your own mother.
Crystal: Come on!

01:29.790 --> 01:32.057
- Okay, bye! Mm! Have fun!
- Okay! Thank you.

01:32.126 --> 01:33.992

Peace!

01:37.998 --> 01:39.398

talking about?

01:39.533 --> 01:41.933
- Oh, um... Uh, val?

01:42.002 --> 01:44.069
- Oh, just my biggest fear.

01:44.071 --> 01:46.738
Which is certainly not
my two monstrous children

01:46.874 --> 01:48.806
Making me a grandma
before my time

01:48.843 --> 01:50.542
By sharing the vagina
of a woman

01:50.578 --> 01:52.478
Who doesn't even care
what semen she's cooking.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.346
(laughs) it's not that.

01:54.348 --> 01:56.748
It's uh...

01:58.485 --> 02:00.385
It's really not.
(children shout playfully)

02:00.387 --> 02:02.587
- So what is it?

02:03.724 --> 02:05.257
- (horrified exhale)

02:05.259 --> 02:07.960
- Why do we come to this thing?

02:07.962 --> 02:09.427
- I don't know.
I don't know.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.599

02:16.503 --> 02:18.436
Charlie: I know!

02:18.472 --> 02:22.508

but she wouldn't listen.

Hey buddy, who you talkin' to?

02:31.452 --> 02:33.418
Just talkin' to the wall?
That's kinda fun.

02:33.420 --> 02:35.453
But, you know, it's late.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.789
- No, I'm talking to her.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.727
- Who's uh, who's her?
(chuckles nervously)

02:41.729 --> 02:43.328
- The lady.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.866
- Uh huh.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.601
- She's watching you.

to someone.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.345
- Mm-hmm.

03:00.347 --> 03:03.081
- Pausing to let them speak,
nobody there. Ugh!

03:03.150 --> 03:04.616
- Okay, well... (sighs)

03:04.685 --> 03:06.418
It's one of two things:

03:06.487 --> 03:08.620
Either charlie has
an imaginary friend

03:08.622 --> 03:10.088
Or, and this is a big or,

03:10.224 --> 03:12.891
Charlie has contacted a spirit.
- What?

03:13.026 --> 03:14.426
- Kids see ghosts!

03:14.495 --> 03:16.961
My aunt mona saw ghosts all
the time when she was a kid,

03:16.997 --> 03:18.430
And she was the life
of the party.

03:18.499 --> 03:20.198
- Was?

03:20.201 --> 03:21.700
- Well, no one's seen her
in 15 years.

03:21.769 --> 03:24.002
- (snaps fingers) great news!
- It was benign?

03:24.004 --> 03:25.737
- Two for two!
- (relieved sigh)

03:25.872 --> 03:27.639
- I am unkillable!
(laughs)

03:27.774 --> 03:29.908
But that's not the news,
chapter-gate worked.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.376
- What do you mean,
how do you know?

03:31.445 --> 03:33.211
- We've been getting nothing
but press requests

03:33.247 --> 03:35.681
For rebecca anderson
since those leaked pages.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.982
- Yes, yes, yes!
We are winning!

03:38.018 --> 03:39.417

03:39.419 --> 03:41.420

(chuckles)

03:44.791 --> 03:46.458
Did I not use that correctly
or what? What--

03:46.593 --> 03:48.192
- No, you did.

03:48.229 --> 03:49.461
- I mean, it was like,
perfect, actually.

03:49.596 --> 03:52.063
- Hmm! Check me out.
- (kate laughs)

03:52.099 --> 03:54.800
- Oh, uh, you have that pitch
session with the cereal

03:54.935 --> 03:56.635
Company this afternoon, right?
- Holey loops.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.804
- Let's keep up the momentum,
huh?

03:58.806 --> 04:01.139
(chuckles) you still think
you can talk 'em out

04:01.208 --> 04:02.741
Of that dreadful slogan?

04:02.810 --> 04:04.676
- I think I can convince them
to listen to reason.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.945
- (snaps his fingers)
keep on poppin' off!

04:07.080 --> 04:09.548

04:09.683 --> 04:11.349
Nailed it again there, eh?

04:11.418 --> 04:14.452

04:14.488 --> 04:16.421
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

She's at the wheel.

04:18.993 --> 04:20.358
She's at the wheel--

04:20.427 --> 04:22.427
I should work on the cereal
thing, though.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.696
- So was everyone excited to
find out you were pregnant?

04:24.732 --> 04:27.833
- Oh, my reveal was... Usurped.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.567
- No! By who?

04:29.603 --> 04:31.503
- Nina harris.

04:31.638 --> 04:34.439
An emotionally charged
brown-noser at wynston.

04:34.441 --> 04:37.643
Oh, and she got "the raccoon
and the rock" re-issued.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.578
- But I thought you were--
- yeah, me too.

04:39.713 --> 04:42.580
But I guess the new girl
gets whatever she asks for.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.516
Oh, and by the way,

04:44.585 --> 04:46.718
I am also going to be
her mentor,

04:46.787 --> 04:48.520
At her request.

04:48.589 --> 04:50.388
- That's actually
a huge compliment.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.457
- Oh, I'm telling you,
I don't trust this bitch.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.793
I have worked too hard
and too long to be replaced.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.662
So if wynston thinks that
I am just gonna step aside

04:57.665 --> 04:59.798

04:59.800 --> 05:01.432

05:01.468 --> 05:03.167
Namaste.

05:05.072 --> 05:06.404
- You know, it sounds
like you and nina

05:06.540 --> 05:08.439
Are just very different people.
- Clearly.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.274
- But you know what?

05:10.311 --> 05:13.178
Everybody in this park

sunshine to go around.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.185

05:21.221 --> 05:22.854

08:57.804 --> 08:59.637
You have been giving me
nothing but shit

08:59.706 --> 09:01.839
About that whole getting kicked
out of the courtroom thing,

09:01.909 --> 09:04.275
And this whole time, behind
my back, you kissed this?!

09:04.278 --> 09:06.243
Do you want me to kill you?!

09:06.280 --> 09:07.879
- No, not my face!
Lionel: Anne!

09:07.948 --> 09:09.547
(glass shatters)
- oh!

09:09.583 --> 09:11.349
- Oh my god, annie!

09:11.484 --> 09:12.884
- Hey, you're bleeding.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.652
Hey, anne, you're bleeding.
- I'm fine.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.988
Do not follow me!

09:17.057 --> 09:18.723
- Come on,
let me take care of you.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.424
- No.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.393
- Um, annie, I don't think
I can actually leave

09:22.429 --> 09:23.661
Until I get that forgiveness.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.597
- Tomé, get the fuck
out of my house.

09:25.599 --> 09:26.831
- Oh.

09:29.469 --> 09:31.435
Raffic rumbles)

09:32.539 --> 09:34.438
- Thanks again for taking me
to lunch.

09:34.474 --> 09:35.941
- Yeah.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.742
- You know, I, I kinda thought

09:37.744 --> 09:39.611
That maybe you didn't like me.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.413
I was a bit worried
I had stepped on your toes

09:41.415 --> 09:44.282
With the whole "raccoon
and the rock" thing.

09:44.284 --> 09:46.017
- Well...

09:47.254 --> 09:49.287
There's enough sunshine
for everybody, right?

09:49.422 --> 09:51.289
- I just really wanted
to impress you,

09:51.424 --> 09:53.458
It's not very often
you get to sit across

09:53.593 --> 09:55.426
From someone of your
credentials.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.629
- Anyone can get the credits
if they work hard enough.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.131
- Yeah, but that's not all
there is to it, right?

10:00.167 --> 10:01.900
What about the stuff
they don't teach you,

10:01.902 --> 10:03.835
Like, reading people.

10:03.904 --> 10:05.837
- Sure, I mean, yeah,

10:05.906 --> 10:07.905
Being intuitive is important,
mm-hmm.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.841
- And your drive, I mean,
it's not every woman

10:09.910 --> 10:12.410
Who puts her career above
starting a family.

10:15.182 --> 10:17.782
- Well, I hate to break it
to you, but, uh...

10:17.818 --> 10:20.018
- Wait, what?

10:20.020 --> 10:22.854
- (laughs)
- you are not pregnant!

10:25.459 --> 10:27.325
You're braver than I thought.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.759
- Thank you.

10:30.364 --> 10:33.398
Yeah, I've-I've barely
told anyone, and um...

10:33.467 --> 10:35.400
It feels really good to.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.436
- Oh! Are you crying?

10:38.505 --> 10:40.271
No! You're gonna make me cry!

10:40.273 --> 10:41.973
(both laugh)
- you started it.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.275
- (laughs) not now!
- Go away!

10:46.146 --> 10:47.745
(both laugh)

10:49.149 --> 10:51.348
- I gotta tell you,
we are such big fans

10:51.385 --> 10:53.150
Of holey loops cereal
around here.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.652
We love all the flavours.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.120
The variety is second
to none.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.622
Now, I'd love to talk to you
about the slogan.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.424
- No, we don't touch
the slogan.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.027
- Oh, uh...

11:02.162 --> 11:03.962
"a hole for every taste."

11:04.097 --> 11:05.730
- Came up with it myself.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.832
Pretty proud of it, actually.
- Uh huh.

11:07.834 --> 11:11.335
I just um, I don't think
it speaks to the product.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.605
- How do you mean?
- Well, do you worry,

11:14.675 --> 11:16.908
You know, that it could be
misconstrued?

11:17.043 --> 11:20.378
All the "hole" talk,
a little bit confusing.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.313
- Uh, I don't think
it's confusing at all.

11:22.315 --> 11:23.981
It's hole-shaped cereal,

11:24.017 --> 11:26.651
That comes in many flavours.
So it satisfies every taste.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.186
It's quite simple, actually.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.321
Even a complete idiot could
understand it. (chuckles)

11:32.893 --> 11:34.859
- Uh huh.

11:34.895 --> 11:36.794
Thank you for coming in today.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.030
I know this focus group
was short notice,

11:39.032 --> 11:41.065
But we wanted to get your
thoughts and reactions

11:41.101 --> 11:42.867
On a particular slogan.

11:42.869 --> 11:46.837
What kind of product do you
think this is a slogan for?

11:48.208 --> 11:50.541
- It's for flavoured
dental dams, duh!

11:51.678 --> 11:52.910
- Interesting, sure.

11:52.946 --> 11:54.578
Any other guesses?

11:54.614 --> 11:56.915
Forrest?
- What are dental dams?

11:56.917 --> 11:58.883
- They're condoms,

11:58.952 --> 12:01.018
But for muff-diving.
- What?!

12:01.054 --> 12:03.053
I've been putting myself
at risk for all these years?

12:03.090 --> 12:04.722
- I'm so sorry.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.491
- I'll show you how they work
if you wanna suit up.

12:06.626 --> 12:07.892
- For real?

12:07.894 --> 12:09.894
- Okay, so, it's uh,
it's not a dental dam.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.363
- How could it be a slogan for
anything but a dental dam?

12:12.432 --> 12:13.765
(all arguing at once)

12:13.767 --> 12:15.767
- I can't believe you pulled
this off so quickly.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.835
- Are you kidding? These people
have nowhere else to be.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.771
- They're definitely
proving your point.

12:19.773 --> 12:21.306
Juniper: Maybe it's just me,
but when it comes

12:21.441 --> 12:23.574
To dental dams, I actually
prefer the rubber flavour.

12:23.643 --> 12:26.377
- Like, what kinda rubber,
though? Tire? Rain boot?

12:26.513 --> 12:28.046
- Yeah, this is insane,
how are they supposed

12:28.181 --> 12:29.781
To understand this without
context?

12:29.916 --> 12:31.316
- Fair, totally fair.

12:31.451 --> 12:34.919
So, what if I told you that
"a hole for every taste"

12:34.921 --> 12:37.388
Was a cereal slogan?

12:37.390 --> 12:39.623
All: Ohhhh!

12:40.927 --> 12:43.394
Juniper: Nice!
- See? They get it.

12:43.396 --> 12:47.198
- Because like, the whole world
gets to taste it.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.733
- Wrong spelling of "hole,"
but very close.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.135
- Ah, we're gettin' close,
we're gettin' close.

12:51.138 --> 12:53.537
Joseph: Yeah.
- Because it's in a hole.

12:53.573 --> 12:55.340
And they're hole-they're...

12:55.475 --> 12:57.508
- I guess they're confused.
- Hmm!

12:57.577 --> 12:59.910
- What, is it like,
whole milk, maybe?

12:59.946 --> 13:01.846
Juniper: Which hole do you
put the cereal in?

13:01.915 --> 13:03.815
Is it dealer's choice?
- No, no, no, no!

13:03.817 --> 13:05.517
It tastes like different holes!

13:05.652 --> 13:07.484
- Nope, wrong again, whew!

13:07.521 --> 13:09.053
- Oh my god, guys!

13:09.122 --> 13:12.656
It's hole-shaped cereal that
comes in many flavours!

13:13.794 --> 13:15.726
- Why didn't you just say that?
- I did!

13:15.762 --> 13:17.996
- Holes are all kinds
of shapes, man.

13:17.998 --> 13:20.798
- So stupid.
- I think I used to work here.

13:20.867 --> 13:23.901
- (sighs) okay,

13:23.970 --> 13:25.837
You've made your point.

13:25.839 --> 13:28.106
I'll talk to my partners,
and we'll set up a follow-up.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.708
- I think that's really smart,
yeah.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.177
<i> Protesters: (chanting)</i>
<i> we're clean, you're dirty!</i>

13:32.312 --> 13:34.178
- What's that chanting?

13:34.181 --> 13:36.014
- Ugh! So many protests
in the neighbourhood, very hip.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.182
(chuckles) so maybe we could
sit down next week?

13:38.218 --> 13:40.451
- Uh, kate? A word?

13:40.453 --> 13:42.520
- Just uh, one sec.
And then we--

13:42.655 --> 13:44.455
- Urgent! Sorry, uh,
it's urgent.

13:44.591 --> 13:47.191
- It's urgent, so just...
- Mm-hmm.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.193
(protesters chant)
- what?

13:49.196 --> 13:51.329
- Looks like goldie's got
an army outside the building.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.631
- We're clean, you're dirty!

13:53.633 --> 13:55.733
- Sorry, are they
protesting you?

13:55.802 --> 13:57.534
- I don't...

13:57.571 --> 14:00.204
- I think we're gonna hold off
on that follow-up meeting.

- We're clean, you're dirty!

14:13.253 --> 14:15.053
- Okay, let's just calm down.

14:15.188 --> 14:17.221
- What's your plan, exactly,
kate?

14:17.223 --> 14:18.989
Because that's an angry mob.
- He's right.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.759
Things could get ugly, fast!
- Would you two stop?

14:21.761 --> 14:23.494
I'm sure these people will
listen to some good,

14:23.630 --> 14:25.363
Old-fashioned communication.

14:25.432 --> 14:27.498

Okay! Okay.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.570
Okay, someone brought eggs.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.171
Guys, listen to me, all right,

14:34.207 --> 14:36.307
I empathize with
your situation.

14:36.442 --> 14:38.676

14:38.745 --> 14:40.378
Kate: Okay!
Rosie: Oh no!

don't want you to sabotage

14:43.450 --> 14:45.349

14:47.420 --> 14:48.653

yeah, thanks, gare.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.211
Next.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.213

15:16.616 --> 15:18.082
You look very sweaty.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.351
- Well, maybe if it wasn't
so goddamn hot in here!

15:20.420 --> 15:22.553
- Okay, uh, these people put
a lot of time and energy

15:22.622 --> 15:24.489
Into this, honey, okay?
- Yeah, but, city hall--

15:24.624 --> 15:26.590
- We can go later.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.359
A few weeks isn't going
to kill anybody.

next is louise.

and I can't wait to meet

16:22.148 --> 16:24.114
Sloane, you connect
with the author?

16:24.150 --> 16:26.617

that I could do that.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.822
- Well, uh, I've already
cultivated a relationship

16:31.858 --> 16:33.758
With the author, so I think
it's probably best

16:33.827 --> 16:35.193
If I handle that invitation.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.495

16:40.700 --> 16:42.233

you guys to pull the trigger.
