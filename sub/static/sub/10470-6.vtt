WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:01.710
'Previously on Broadchurch.'

00:01.760 --> 00:03.750
She says she forgives you...

00:03.800 --> 00:05.150
about the pendant.

00:05.200 --> 00:08.230
Why would I kill a 12-year-old girl?

00:08.280 --> 00:10.430
Why was her pendant
found in your vehicle?

00:10.480 --> 00:15.870
My DS was taking that bagged
evidence... back to HQ.

00:15.920 --> 00:18.070
And... her car was broken into.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.670
~ There's grounds for reopening the case.
~ Don't do this.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.430
Oh, God. You're his wife.

00:22.480 --> 00:26.310
I can't go on meeting you here, mate. People
will start getting the wrong idea.

00:26.360 --> 00:29.070
~ What are you doing here?
~ I want to give evidence.

00:29.120 --> 00:31.430
You want me to go in the
witness box, don't you?

00:31.480 --> 00:33.470
Honestly? I'm torn.

00:33.520 --> 00:36.670
You said yourself, somebody needs
to speak up for Dan. Well...

00:36.720 --> 00:39.920
I'm his dad. It should
be down to me, you know?

00:40.080 --> 00:42.510
Thorp AgriServices.
What is it they do?

00:42.560 --> 00:45.430
Services to the
agricultural industries.

00:48.600 --> 00:50.310
Oh, God, it's a furnace.

00:50.360 --> 00:53.230
Do you still think
Lisa Newbery's alive?

00:55.000 --> 01:01.074

01:09.960 --> 01:13.160
There's a narrow lane about
500 yards in that direction.

01:13.600 --> 01:16.910
This footpath and the lane were
both examined by Forensics

01:16.960 --> 01:20.270
for tyre tracks and footmarks, but
they never got anything useful.

01:20.320 --> 01:23.230
It's a long way to carry a
body without being noticed.

01:23.280 --> 01:26.230
This stretch was never used
much, even by the dog walkers.

01:26.280 --> 01:28.230
So the killer had enough
local knowledge

01:28.280 --> 01:30.910
to realise the chances
of being spotted were low.

01:30.960 --> 01:34.360
Other access points are
through those woods there.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.000
What time's Tom due in the box?

01:52.800 --> 01:54.940
Why have they called Tom?

01:55.520 --> 01:58.520
Son's love for a father - that
sort of thing, I expect.

02:05.040 --> 02:08.389
~ We could have got back in time.
~ Tom said if I was there

02:08.440 --> 02:10.750
he'd ask from the witness
box for me to be removed.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.800
God, I'm sorry.

02:14.960 --> 02:18.680
~ Are you all right?
~ I walked through here
just before I found Pippa.

02:23.320 --> 02:26.720
So how far are we from
where the Gillespies live?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.270
Er... Just over three miles.

02:30.240 --> 02:33.270
And you think Pippa's body could
have been brought through here?

02:33.320 --> 02:35.990
That's what I always thought
but it was impossible to know.

02:36.040 --> 02:39.310
It was spring so this whole
area was covered in bluebells.

02:39.360 --> 02:42.390
And Claire Ripley's being sent
bluebells through the post.

02:42.440 --> 02:44.950
Or she's sending them to herself.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.350
Hiding it in a wardrobe in a guest
room, where it might be found.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.550
~ Why would she do that?
~ To screw around with us.

02:50.600 --> 02:53.310
It's what they all do - her and
Ashworth, even the Gillespies.

02:53.360 --> 02:55.590
I don't think any one of
them told the whole truth.

02:55.640 --> 02:59.510
The stress they've put you under,
do it to them and start with Claire.

03:06.920 --> 03:10.120
It's from Lucy. Tom's going
in the witness box.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.070
Do you get along with your dad, Tom?

03:16.240 --> 03:17.750
I love him.

03:17.800 --> 03:21.960
Has he ever made you do anything
that made you feel uncomfortable?

03:22.920 --> 03:28.270
~ No.
~ Were you aware of any contact
between Danny and your dad?

03:28.320 --> 03:30.630
No. Danny was my friend, not his.

03:30.680 --> 03:35.320
The day Danny's body was found,
how did your dad behave?

03:36.760 --> 03:38.590
Normally.

03:38.640 --> 03:41.190
I got home from school
and he made me tea.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.440
How was he the days after?

03:44.040 --> 03:46.580
He was upset... like we all were.

03:48.640 --> 03:51.840
Now, how did you get
to know Susan Wright?

03:52.960 --> 03:54.350
Erm...

03:54.400 --> 03:56.800
Right, I met her in the arcade.

03:57.920 --> 04:00.110
I liked her dog, Vince.

04:00.160 --> 04:02.270
She let me visit her caravan.

04:02.320 --> 04:05.520
Have you ever met anyone
else in that caravan?

04:06.560 --> 04:08.560
(Beth, listen.)

04:13.440 --> 04:15.440
Yes.

04:21.640 --> 04:23.630
Danny's dad, Mark.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.390
~ What's he talking about?
~ Nothing.

04:25.440 --> 04:28.150
(Why didn't Mark tell us about that?)

04:28.200 --> 04:32.190
He said that... we could meet and
other people don't have to know.

04:32.240 --> 04:34.600
What did you do with Mark?

04:36.160 --> 04:38.830
We played FIFA on the PlayStation.

04:38.880 --> 04:41.280
Did you ever talk about Danny?

04:44.360 --> 04:46.360
Yes.

04:49.720 --> 04:51.720
He said he was guilty.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.560
Guilty of what?

05:00.200 --> 05:02.190
He said...

05:02.240 --> 05:04.510
Danny's death was his fault.

05:05.040 --> 05:07.040
(What?!)

05:14.480 --> 05:18.080
That's where you were all
those times I was calling.

05:20.840 --> 05:23.180
It made me feel close to Dan.

05:27.520 --> 05:29.520
(I'm sorry.)

05:42.800 --> 05:45.510
It doesn't help me if I
don't know these things.

05:45.560 --> 05:47.910
I never thought it would be
a part of this. I'm sorry.

05:47.960 --> 05:49.950
Everything's a part of it, Mark.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
What are you gonna do?

05:53.840 --> 05:56.310
Try and take Tom Miller apart...

05:56.840 --> 05:59.110
.. kindly, precisely, so...

05:59.840 --> 06:02.070
.. the jury don't hate me...

06:02.120 --> 06:04.120
or you.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.190
~ Hello?
~ It's me.

06:17.240 --> 06:19.390
~ I think we are done.
~ What?

06:19.440 --> 06:22.110
I was protecting you from Lee,
you don't want that any more.

06:22.160 --> 06:25.310
You keep changing your story about
what happened. This isn't working,

06:25.360 --> 06:27.350
I need you to move out.

06:27.400 --> 06:30.030
Alec, where are you? Let's
talk about this face-to-face.

06:30.080 --> 06:33.070
~ No, I'm giving you 48 hours.
~ What's going on? You can't do that!

06:33.120 --> 06:35.720
I can. It's over, Claire. OK?

06:43.680 --> 06:45.680
Oh, shit.

06:51.760 --> 06:53.750
Oh, shit.

06:53.800 --> 06:55.800
Shit! Shit! Shit!

06:58.240 --> 07:00.240
Oh, shit!

07:13.400 --> 07:17.670
Tom, you know, don't you, that when
someone is found guilty of murder

07:17.720 --> 07:20.590
they go to prison for
a number of years?

07:22.560 --> 07:24.550
Yes.

07:24.600 --> 07:27.470
You love your dad very
much, don't you?

07:31.400 --> 07:33.390
He's a great dad.

07:33.440 --> 07:37.430
But you know that telling lies,
even to protect someone you love,

07:37.480 --> 07:39.480
is wrong?

07:40.600 --> 07:42.740
I'm not lying for my dad.

07:43.720 --> 07:48.000
Tom, I'm suggesting that that's
exactly what you are doing.

07:50.760 --> 07:54.480
~ No.
~ Mark Latimer didn't say
he killed Danny, did he?

07:57.720 --> 07:59.710
He said he was guilty.

07:59.760 --> 08:03.160
Did he say he 'was' guilty
or he 'felt' guilty?

08:03.920 --> 08:07.400
~ There's a big difference.
~ My dad wouldn't have killed Danny.

08:09.080 --> 08:11.510
So let me ask you...

08:11.560 --> 08:15.790
has every single word you've
said to this court

08:15.840 --> 08:18.400
been absolutely, 100% true?

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Tom?

08:29.160 --> 08:31.390
I think so.

08:31.440 --> 08:34.440
I'm sorry, 'I think
so' isn't good enough.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.880
The court needs you to be certain.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.880
This isn't about your dad. This
is about your friend Danny.

08:43.240 --> 08:46.640
Because Danny can't speak
up for himself any more.

08:47.160 --> 08:51.710
So our job is to find out what
Danny would say if he was here.

08:51.760 --> 08:54.100
You see that, don't you, Tom?

08:54.360 --> 08:57.480
~ Yes.
~ We all want justice for Danny.

09:02.520 --> 09:04.660
So let me ask you again.

09:06.040 --> 09:10.120
Has every word you've said
here been 100% true?

09:14.800 --> 09:17.960
Did Mark Latimer say he 'was' guilty?

09:27.760 --> 09:29.760
No.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.320
I'm sorry.

09:37.640 --> 09:39.640
Thank you, Tom.

09:49.120 --> 09:51.990
I want the details of the stalker
that was seen around the estate

09:52.040 --> 09:53.950
in the weeks before
the girls disappeared.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.790
And against my better judgement
I put all the statements -

09:56.840 --> 09:59.390
four sightings in the
week before - on here.

09:59.440 --> 10:02.430
~ Thank you.
~ Plus all CCTV collected from the case.

10:02.480 --> 10:05.310
And there's a company
- Thorp AgriServices.

10:05.360 --> 10:08.150
~ If we could send a forensics team -
~ Uh-uh. Stop.

10:08.200 --> 10:11.070
No forensics teams, nothing
official. I'm pushing as it is.

10:11.120 --> 10:13.120
Do not drop me in it.

10:13.720 --> 10:17.200
Erm... I'm going into hospital
tomorrow - pacemaker.

10:19.320 --> 10:21.320
Bloody hell.

10:22.800 --> 10:25.070
Are you all right with that?

10:26.160 --> 10:28.350
If anything happens,
I've made a will.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.390
You are worried.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.440
Have you told Daisy?

10:35.160 --> 10:37.430
Phew!

10:37.480 --> 10:39.480
Well erm...

10:40.480 --> 10:42.480
.. good luck.

10:43.360 --> 10:45.230
~ I miss you, Tess.
~ Oh, Alec, please...

10:45.280 --> 10:48.280
I wish we could go back,
still be a family.

10:52.960 --> 10:56.070
Right, these are the accounts
for the last seven years.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.190
Oh, do you remember
ever doing any work

10:58.240 --> 11:01.110
for a company called
Thorp AgriServices?

11:01.560 --> 11:03.150
I don't think so.

11:03.200 --> 11:06.390
I'm surprised you remember anything,
the amount of that you put away.

11:06.440 --> 11:08.440
Are you still here?

11:10.720 --> 11:13.120
Oh, that's a beautiful picture.

11:14.320 --> 11:16.310
It's my favourite one of her.

11:16.360 --> 11:19.910
And that pendant, is that the one
that was found in Ashworth's car -

11:19.960 --> 11:22.560
~ the missing bit of evidence?
~ Yeah.

11:23.480 --> 11:26.270
The side gate was open. Sorry,
I got a bit delayed.

11:26.320 --> 11:30.360
Ah. Don't worry, I was just
about to... go outside anyway.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.710
No texts, Lucy's not
answering her phone,

11:34.760 --> 11:36.590
and Olly's not tweeting
court updates.

11:36.640 --> 11:39.270
~ Well, maybe the court's still sitting.
~ I need to get back.

11:39.320 --> 11:40.990
I need to know what's happened.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.030
Did you ask Cate about
Thorp AgriServices?

11:43.080 --> 11:45.480
Yeah, she denied all knowledge.

11:49.320 --> 11:51.320
What are you doing?

11:53.880 --> 11:56.150
Ah.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.070
Do all the gardens have those?

11:58.120 --> 12:00.630
No, it was put in by Lee Ashworth.

12:00.680 --> 12:04.070
With Ricky and Cate's approval. Why
did they never have it removed?

12:04.120 --> 12:07.790
It's for kids to go in and out of
each other's gardens, not grown-ups.

12:07.840 --> 12:11.160
Lee and Claire didn't have any
kids. Why have they got that?

12:44.540 --> 12:47.340
Are you all right?
What are you doing?

12:49.180 --> 12:51.650
Has he told you what he's done?!

12:51.780 --> 12:55.020
~ Yeah.
~ Oh, right. So he's sent you along, has he?

12:56.060 --> 12:58.050
His pet, Ellie.

12:58.100 --> 13:00.970
~ I just came to see how you were doing.
~ I put my life in his hands

13:01.020 --> 13:04.210
and he dragged me here to
this shithole - hid me away!

13:04.260 --> 13:06.490
I put my trust in him.
I've done nothing wrong

13:06.540 --> 13:08.940
and he just drops me like that.

13:11.020 --> 13:13.010
Can I come and live with you?

13:13.060 --> 13:15.930
That wouldn't work - I live
in a tiny little studio flat

13:15.980 --> 13:18.730
~ near the station in Devon.
~ What about your house in town?

13:18.780 --> 13:20.330
~ No.
~ Why not?

13:20.380 --> 13:24.010
~ I don't want you living there.
~ I thought we were friends.
~ Really?

13:24.060 --> 13:26.170
I think you've been
playing all of us.

13:26.220 --> 13:28.210
~ Why would I do that?
~ I don't know.

13:28.260 --> 13:31.370
Well, I haven't done that.
I swear, I have not done that.

13:31.420 --> 13:34.130
And he's just jealous because
I've slept with Lee.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.320
Why would he be jealous?

13:36.580 --> 13:38.570
Angry, OK? I meant angry.

13:38.620 --> 13:41.330
Look, either you want protecting
from Lee or you don't.

13:41.380 --> 13:42.810
You can't have it both ways.

13:42.860 --> 13:44.810
I said, when I see him,
I just lose myself.

13:44.860 --> 13:46.730
It's... it's the sex, Ellie.

13:46.780 --> 13:49.250
It's just... something happens
when we're together.

13:49.300 --> 13:52.170
Oh, please. Have a
little self-control.

13:52.500 --> 13:55.450
Look, if you want to be my friend,
you tell me everything -

13:55.500 --> 13:57.250
the truth, past and present -

13:57.300 --> 14:00.820
and then maybe I'll have a little
word with with Hardy about you.

14:03.020 --> 14:04.850
Fine.

14:04.900 --> 14:08.170
I will. You come over and we'll talk.
And maybe I can do your hair.

14:08.220 --> 14:11.970
~ What?
~ Well, it's... I-I haven't done
anybody's hair in a long time.

14:12.020 --> 14:14.010
Please?

14:14.060 --> 14:16.060
All right.

14:16.940 --> 14:19.250
I told Chlo to stay home
with Lizzie today.

14:19.300 --> 14:22.420
~ Maybe you shouldn't come either.
~ Nice try. I'm coming.

14:23.300 --> 14:26.900
Tell the truth up there. We can't
have another witness unravel.

14:29.260 --> 14:33.530
Now, what I want from you
is an exact written timeline

14:33.580 --> 14:36.290
of who was where when
my son was beaten up.

14:36.340 --> 14:40.450
I want to know the names of officers
and supervisors on duty

14:40.500 --> 14:43.800
so I can make a specific
disciplinary complaint.

14:44.140 --> 14:46.490
Oh, no, no, no.

14:46.540 --> 14:48.570
It's not gonna take
any longer than that

14:48.620 --> 14:50.810
because I'm not gonna
be off your back

14:50.860 --> 14:53.530
until I know that he is
on his way somewhere safe.

14:53.580 --> 14:56.980
And don't try and piss me about,
because I am relentless.

14:57.420 --> 14:59.410
You've got 60 minutes.

14:59.460 --> 15:00.970
(Prick.)

15:01.020 --> 15:02.690
~ Morning!
~ Hi.

15:02.740 --> 15:05.810
They're doing it. Mark Latimer
is going in the box.

15:05.860 --> 15:08.090
~ Good.
~ Good?

15:08.140 --> 15:11.340
This is what you've been
aiming for, isn't it?

15:21.500 --> 15:23.930
Do you wish to swear or affirm?

15:23.980 --> 15:25.730
Affirm.

15:25.780 --> 15:27.780
Please read the card.

15:29.420 --> 15:31.930
'I do solemnly, sincerely
and truly declare

15:31.980 --> 15:34.770
and affirm that the evidence
I shall give...

15:34.820 --> 15:38.300
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.'

15:44.540 --> 15:46.740
(What the living fuck.)

15:50.340 --> 15:52.370
Are you sure you want
to be here today?

15:52.420 --> 15:55.420
I want to know what's
being said about me.

15:58.140 --> 16:01.780
Mr Latimer, how well do
you know Nigel Carter?

16:02.420 --> 16:05.010
Very well. He's worked
with me four years now.

16:05.060 --> 16:07.130
Do you trust him?

16:07.180 --> 16:09.370
With my life.

16:09.420 --> 16:10.730
And my son's life.

16:10.780 --> 16:14.450
So what do you say to the accusation
that Susan Wright saw Nigel Carter

16:14.500 --> 16:16.770
carrying your son's body
the night of his death?

16:16.820 --> 16:20.420
She's obviously got two bald blokes
mixed up, cos it wasn't Nige.

16:22.140 --> 16:26.700
Since Danny's death, have
you been meeting Tom Miller?

16:28.380 --> 16:30.380
Yeah, I have.

16:30.860 --> 16:33.660
I was trying to help
him through this.

16:34.380 --> 16:37.650
But I should have thought
it through a bit more. It...

16:37.700 --> 16:39.690
It looks a bit odd.

16:39.740 --> 16:41.940
Did you tell Tom Miller...

16:42.740 --> 16:45.010
.. that you were guilty
of killing your son?

16:45.060 --> 16:47.210
No.

16:47.260 --> 16:49.400
I said I 'felt' guilty...

16:50.580 --> 16:53.180
.. because I wasn't there for Dan.

16:53.620 --> 16:56.900
Where were you on the night of
your son's death, Mr Latimer?

17:06.060 --> 17:09.180
I was with Becca Fisher - the
owner of the Traders Hotel.

17:10.220 --> 17:12.210
Were you having an affair?

17:12.260 --> 17:14.260
No.

17:15.460 --> 17:18.170
It was the first time anything
had... happened.

17:18.220 --> 17:20.490
Did you have sex that night?

17:22.660 --> 17:24.660
~ Yes.
~ Where?

17:26.819 --> 17:29.050
In her car.

17:29.100 --> 17:30.970
Then what did you do?

17:31.020 --> 17:33.330
Then she drove me back
to the cliff-top car park.

17:33.380 --> 17:35.730
I picked up my car and...

17:35.780 --> 17:37.650
we went our separate ways.

17:37.700 --> 17:40.050
And did you go home immediately?

17:40.100 --> 17:42.090
No, it was...

17:42.140 --> 17:44.850
about an hour, an hour
and a half later.

17:44.900 --> 17:47.500
Where did you go during that time?

17:51.700 --> 17:53.970
Mr Latimer, where were you?

17:59.260 --> 18:01.400
I drove through the vale.

18:01.780 --> 18:04.050
And I parked up on the hill.

18:06.940 --> 18:10.500
And I started writing this
- I dunno - note, letter.

18:11.820 --> 18:13.820
A letter to whom?

18:15.860 --> 18:17.860
To Beth, my wife.

18:18.980 --> 18:21.490
Why would you be writing
a letter to your wife

18:21.540 --> 18:23.810
at that time of the morning?

18:26.740 --> 18:28.880
I was saying it was over.

18:30.780 --> 18:33.860
That I'd met someone else,
that our marriage was done.

18:37.180 --> 18:39.720
I'd gone a bit mad. I was like...

18:40.420 --> 18:44.220
.. like a kid of 14, giddy
with a fling. I'm not proud.

19:04.700 --> 19:06.840
Come on, Beth. Come here.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.370
Beth, come on. Come here.

19:09.420 --> 19:12.420
Come here. It's all
right. It's all right.

19:12.660 --> 19:15.940
It's not Mark. This is not Mark.
This is Joe doing this to us.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.640
We won't let him win, OK?

19:36.900 --> 19:40.170
~ Why are we waiting here anyway?
~ Just hang on for one minute.

19:40.220 --> 19:42.850
Now, Ell, before you say anything -

19:42.900 --> 19:44.730
~ I don't want to talk to you.
~ Sit down.

19:44.780 --> 19:46.210
Sit down!

19:46.260 --> 19:48.490
Do you see what you put
Mark and Beth through?!

19:48.540 --> 19:50.530
He wouldn't be up there
if it wasn't for you.

19:50.580 --> 19:53.610
I know you want to protect your father
but he is a murderer and a shit

19:53.660 --> 19:55.930
and he deserves none of
your feelings for him.

19:55.980 --> 19:57.410
Look what you ended up doing!

19:57.460 --> 20:01.130
You lied, on oath, in a court of
law and I hope you're ashamed!

20:01.180 --> 20:03.100
Are you? ARE YOU?!

20:03.580 --> 20:04.650
Yes. Yes, Mum.

20:04.700 --> 20:07.090
You are coming home with me
tonight back to the house.

20:07.140 --> 20:09.850
~ No, we're not cos -
~ Yes we are because I am your bloody mother!

20:09.900 --> 20:12.210
If I have to drag you kicking
and screaming, I will!

20:12.260 --> 20:15.250
Your father has done enough damage
and I will not let him destroy us!

20:15.300 --> 20:17.300
Do you understand?!

20:20.140 --> 20:22.130
Yes, Mum.

20:22.180 --> 20:24.180
Right, that's... good.

20:31.220 --> 20:35.330
It's quite a coincidence that
neither you nor Nigel Carter

20:35.380 --> 20:38.900
have an alibi for around the time
of your son's death, isn't it?

20:39.300 --> 20:42.730
~ That's the way it was.
~ You admit that you were at the car park

20:42.780 --> 20:46.890
next to the cliff-top hut around
the time your son was killed?

20:46.940 --> 20:49.250
I was, yeah.

20:49.300 --> 20:52.300
What's the distance between
the car park and the hut?

20:53.060 --> 20:55.050
I don't know, 50 yards.

20:55.100 --> 20:59.580
You were 50 yards away from
where your son was killed.

21:02.500 --> 21:06.900
~ Yes.
~ At almost exactly the time he was killed.

21:12.660 --> 21:13.770
Yeah.

21:13.820 --> 21:15.410
So, from the hut,

21:15.460 --> 21:17.770
it's possible that Danny
could have seen you

21:17.820 --> 21:20.160
with Becca Fisher that night?

21:25.260 --> 21:27.660
You need to answer, Mr Latimer.

21:29.980 --> 21:31.980
It's possible, yeah.

21:33.300 --> 21:35.530
Isn't it true...

21:35.580 --> 21:38.170
that because Danny saw you
with Becca that night -

21:38.220 --> 21:40.250
I said it was possible,
not that it happened.

21:40.300 --> 21:43.650
.. that you strangled him
in that cliff-top hut -

21:43.700 --> 21:46.130
~ No.
~ .. and then called your mate

21:46.180 --> 21:50.130
and colleague Nige Carter
to dispose of the body -

21:50.180 --> 21:53.570
~ None of that happened.
~ .. who was then seen by Susan Wright.

21:53.620 --> 21:55.010
Not true! None of that is true!

21:55.060 --> 21:58.850
And then you arrange these strange
meetings with Tom Miller

21:58.900 --> 22:01.930
because you felt guilty that
his father was taking the blame.

22:01.980 --> 22:03.980
I did not kill my son!

22:09.220 --> 22:13.460
How did you get in to see Joe Miller
while he was in police custody?

22:19.180 --> 22:22.330
~ I don't know what you mean.
~ Did you bribe a police officer?

22:22.380 --> 22:25.690
My Lady, this has no relevance to
the evidence Mr Latimer can give.

22:25.740 --> 22:28.480
It's fantastically relevant, My Lady.

22:29.060 --> 22:31.260
You can wait, Miss Knight.

22:31.620 --> 22:34.620
How did you get into
the cells, Mr Latimer?

22:37.020 --> 22:40.290
The custody sergeant was
an old friend. He let me in.

22:40.340 --> 22:44.100
Did you go there to threaten
Mr Miller to be silent?

22:44.540 --> 22:49.490
Or to gloat that he was taking the
blame for a murder you'd committed?

22:49.540 --> 22:50.810
No, it was nothing like that.

22:50.860 --> 22:53.170
My Lady, I'd like to
raise a point of law.

22:53.220 --> 22:55.650
I'm sure you would, Miss Bishop.

22:55.700 --> 22:58.700
Members of the jury, would
you step out, please?

23:00.540 --> 23:02.450
Tell me we didn't know any of this!

23:02.500 --> 23:04.970
It's not in any statement,
any disclosure.

23:05.020 --> 23:07.160
Mark just didn't tell us.

23:41.300 --> 23:44.090
The investigating officers
in this case

23:44.140 --> 23:49.380
have breached the PACE codes
of practice time and time again.

23:50.220 --> 23:55.100
This is a fundamentally flawed
investigation, littered with errors.

23:55.780 --> 23:58.610
The defence applies for
a stay of proceedings

23:58.660 --> 24:02.410
on the grounds that there has been
an abuse of the court's process -

24:02.460 --> 24:05.940
such that the defendant
cannot have a fair trial.

24:08.020 --> 24:11.140
My Lady, I'm asking you
to dismiss this case.

25:14.880 --> 25:17.590
'Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

25:17.640 --> 25:19.640
Wake up! Wake up!'

25:20.920 --> 25:22.920
'Wake up! Wake up!'

25:24.880 --> 25:27.350
(I'm alive.)

25:27.400 --> 25:29.510
I'll hear your submission
now, Miss Knight.

25:29.560 --> 25:31.710
I'd ask for an adjournment

25:31.760 --> 25:34.630
while we obtain statements
from the relevant officers.

25:34.680 --> 25:37.710
Only then can I address whether
there has been an abuse

25:37.760 --> 25:40.030
which prejudices this trial.

25:42.120 --> 25:45.630
All right. You have your
adjournment, Miss Knight.

25:45.680 --> 25:49.790
Talk to the officers concerned and I'll
hear full arguments on it before ruling.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.830
Thank you, my Lady.

26:00.040 --> 26:01.440
What?

26:03.400 --> 26:05.870
~ A text?
~ Don't start, Miller.

26:05.920 --> 26:07.910
You sneak off and send me a text,

26:07.960 --> 26:10.030
knowing my phone won't
be on in the courtroom.

26:10.080 --> 26:11.430
I'll give you money to shut up.

26:11.480 --> 26:13.950
I'll give you more money
to be less of a knob.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.340
I made it. I made it through!

26:16.400 --> 26:20.150
~ Why didn't you tell me?
~ You'd only come and sit with me.

26:20.200 --> 26:22.190
What is wrong with you?!

26:22.240 --> 26:25.310
~ I do need a lift home later, though.
~ I can't.

26:25.360 --> 26:28.640
I'm picking Fred up from Lucy's
and I'm bringing Tom home.

26:29.080 --> 26:31.390
I can drive him.

26:31.440 --> 26:34.870
~ What are you doing here?
~ Suddenly had a thought you might die,

26:34.920 --> 26:36.750
I felt I had to drive
down and see you.

26:36.800 --> 26:39.000
~ I've got this.
~ Right, OK.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.990
I've spoken to the doctors.

26:45.040 --> 26:47.310
They recommend you stay in.

26:49.160 --> 26:51.160
Take me home.

26:53.360 --> 26:55.550
Why is he throwing you out?

26:55.600 --> 26:58.230
Because of you. Because you came
round and we had sex there.

26:58.280 --> 27:00.680
~ Yeah, and you told him.
~ Mm-hm.

27:00.800 --> 27:04.520
~ And what else have you been talking about?
~ No, we need to make a plan.

27:05.160 --> 27:06.990
We had a plan...

27:07.040 --> 27:09.040
and you screwed it.

27:09.760 --> 27:12.960
Oh, you want to talk about
screwing, do you? Huh?

27:22.160 --> 27:24.160
Well, go on!

27:26.160 --> 27:28.150
Go on.

27:28.200 --> 27:31.600
What are you gonna do, Lee?
What are you gonna do?

27:32.640 --> 27:35.750
Do you want to strangle me?
Do you want to punch me?

27:35.800 --> 27:37.800
Do you want to...?

28:35.000 --> 28:37.710
I had to go and see Joe. I
had to look him in the eye.

28:37.760 --> 28:39.630
I wasn't thinking about
the future, Beth,

28:39.680 --> 28:42.750
~ I was thinking about what he'd done to Dan.
~ How is this a marriage?

28:42.800 --> 28:44.310
You share nothing.

28:44.360 --> 28:46.230
You keep everything
locked away from me.

28:46.280 --> 28:47.830
Not from you. It's not about you.

28:47.880 --> 28:49.430
Why isn't it about me?!

28:49.480 --> 28:52.680
Why can't you make it
about me, just for once?

28:53.520 --> 28:56.950
Why are we together, Mark?
Is it just because Danny died?

28:57.000 --> 28:58.670
~ No.
~ Because if it is, don't bother.

28:58.720 --> 29:01.710
~ I don't need you. I could do without you.
~ Don't talk to me like that.

29:01.760 --> 29:03.150
Are you gonna write me a letter?

29:03.200 --> 29:07.350
~ It's better than your endless talking
about it and nothing changing!
~ If you're gonna stay,

29:07.400 --> 29:10.680
sort yourself out. Tell
me everything or piss off.

29:11.280 --> 29:13.710
And, by the way, if this
trial collapses now

29:13.760 --> 29:15.760
it's because of you.

29:46.840 --> 29:49.380
I'm not myself when I'm with you.

29:51.440 --> 29:54.960
I was worried when she wouldn't
put me in the witness box, but...

29:56.000 --> 29:58.400
.. now I see what her plan was.

29:59.760 --> 30:01.760
What do you reckon?

30:02.160 --> 30:03.950
Do you think they'll dismiss it?

30:04.000 --> 30:06.940
Do you think... Do
you think I'm winning?

30:09.440 --> 30:11.440
You're guilty, Joe.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.430
I thought you were on my side.

30:17.480 --> 30:20.750
And I thought I could help you come
to terms with what you've done.

30:20.800 --> 30:25.200
But... I don't see you taking
responsibility for your actions.

30:28.240 --> 30:30.980
How do you think God would view that?

30:35.440 --> 30:37.830
When I was a paramedic...

30:37.880 --> 30:39.950
I saved a lot of lives.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.040
God sees that.

30:44.680 --> 30:47.750
~ He knows the good I've done.
~ It doesn't work like that.

30:47.800 --> 30:50.400
You watched your son lie for you...

30:51.760 --> 30:55.200
.. on oath, and still you're
trying to wriggle free.

31:00.160 --> 31:02.430
I'm done with these visits.

31:05.400 --> 31:07.400
Goodbye, Joe.

31:08.160 --> 31:10.160
Paul?

31:12.480 --> 31:14.480
Paul, don't walk away.

31:16.480 --> 31:18.480
Paul?

31:25.440 --> 31:27.440
All right, wiggy?

31:28.160 --> 31:30.560
Still after that profile piece?

31:30.840 --> 31:34.030
'Woman beneath the wig:
next legal hotshot.'

31:34.080 --> 31:37.480
~ Hey? How am I doing?
~ Can you stop flirting with me?

31:38.160 --> 31:40.230
I'm from London - I know
what you're doing.

31:40.280 --> 31:42.280
Oh, right. OK.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.470
Can you afford to buy me dinner?

31:53.600 --> 31:55.190
So, tell me again.

31:55.240 --> 31:57.910
I spoke to the officer
concerned. He did let Mark in

31:57.960 --> 32:00.550
but Mark spoke to Joe
through the wicket only.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.790
Said he'd known the
Latimers for 15 years.

32:02.840 --> 32:07.270
So now he'll be suspended of duties,
pending an investigation.

32:07.320 --> 32:09.460
Right, clear some space.

32:09.920 --> 32:12.660
Well, move all these papers. Come on.

32:14.760 --> 32:17.070
It's only carbonara...

32:17.120 --> 32:19.830
~ but it's better than nothing.
~ It's great.

32:19.880 --> 32:22.070
Sorry, why are you
cooking for us again?

32:22.120 --> 32:26.070
Ha! Has she ever offered you any food

32:26.120 --> 32:28.310
the whole time you've
worked with her?

32:28.360 --> 32:30.230
~ No.
~ Ha! See?
~ I have.

32:30.280 --> 32:33.790
~ You have not.
~ Well, what about those
Jaffa Cakes that time?

32:33.840 --> 32:35.550
~ I bought those.
~ Did you?

32:35.600 --> 32:38.400
~ You never change.
~ That's a good thing.

32:39.200 --> 32:41.910
Now, Ben...

32:41.960 --> 32:44.310
Jocelyn's got something to tell you.

32:44.360 --> 32:46.900
~ Have I?
~ Have you?
~ Yes, she has.

32:47.720 --> 32:51.240
Something she's been meaning to
say for a while, in confidence.

32:52.880 --> 32:55.270
~ Tell him.
~ You only cooked so you could corner me.

32:55.320 --> 32:57.310
Absolutely.

32:57.360 --> 32:59.360
Get on with it.

33:04.240 --> 33:06.240
My sight's failing.

33:08.160 --> 33:10.160
I'm going blind.

33:10.760 --> 33:14.440
~ What?
~ I have macular degeneration.

33:16.240 --> 33:18.830
It started at the
centre of my vision,

33:18.880 --> 33:22.440
like a... small... black hole.

33:24.160 --> 33:26.150
At the beginning I...

33:26.200 --> 33:29.880
I didn't think it was so serious
but it's steadily getting worse.

33:30.440 --> 33:32.430
Which is why...

33:32.480 --> 33:34.620
I need you to read and...

33:35.680 --> 33:37.820
.. to record everything.

33:38.080 --> 33:40.510
Which is why I stopped taking cases.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.560
Well, until this one.

33:44.680 --> 33:48.070
~ Are you... getting treatment?
~ Mm. I have injections,

33:48.120 --> 33:50.120
which keeps it at bay.

33:51.600 --> 33:53.710
~ For now.
~ I-I'm sorry.

33:53.760 --> 33:56.390
Well, don't be. I mean, the
body lets down the mind,

33:56.440 --> 33:58.430
the mind lets down the body.

33:58.480 --> 34:00.480
It comes to us all.

34:01.160 --> 34:05.000
~ Are you fit enough to
keep going with the case?
~ Yes. I am.

34:05.640 --> 34:08.030
And don't you dare suggest otherwise.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.080
I need this, Ben.

34:11.040 --> 34:13.040
Eat your carbonara.

34:13.800 --> 34:16.150
And you, stop looking so smug.

34:16.199 --> 34:18.199
You're welcome.

34:23.880 --> 34:26.040
Right. Well, this is you.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.600
Mm-hm.

34:29.120 --> 34:32.030
~ They've got nice rooms here, haven't they?
~ OK, Olly,

34:32.080 --> 34:35.230
~ what I'm about to say - it's
not about you, it's about me.
~ Oh, right.

34:35.280 --> 34:37.310
It's just I haven't had sex in ages

34:37.360 --> 34:39.750
and I really feel
like I've earned it.

34:39.800 --> 34:41.190
~ Oh, right.
~ Where do you live?

34:41.239 --> 34:44.830
~ Because I cannot have my
boss finding out about this.
~ Er...

34:44.880 --> 34:47.219
~ That way.
~ OK. Come on, then.

34:49.679 --> 34:53.469
I can't be long, I'm picking up Tom
again. Taking him home, finally.

34:53.520 --> 34:56.320
~ You must be relieved about that.
~ Yeah.

34:56.400 --> 34:58.940
Him, me and Fred - home together.

34:59.600 --> 35:02.270
~ Me and Lee are looking at a house later.
~ Really?

35:02.320 --> 35:04.320
Yeah. Why wouldn't we?

35:04.800 --> 35:08.830
~ So you kept your hairdressing stuff, then?
~ Oh, yeah. That's my magic bag.

35:08.880 --> 35:12.190
Even when I had to leave with Alec,
it was the first thing I packed.

35:12.240 --> 35:15.110
~ Got my portfolio, everything still in it.
~ Really? Can I see?

35:15.160 --> 35:17.160
Yeah, have a look.

35:20.240 --> 35:22.240
Ooh.

35:22.920 --> 35:25.150
Look at you! Nice.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.340
I scrub up well, don't I?

35:28.120 --> 35:31.820
We were back there the other
day, near your old house.

35:32.880 --> 35:34.880
~ Really?
~ Yeah.

35:35.920 --> 35:39.510
I saw the river where they found
Pippa, walked through the woods.

35:39.560 --> 35:41.870
I spoke to Cate.

35:41.920 --> 35:43.990
~ Is she still drinking?
~ A bit, yeah.

35:44.040 --> 35:47.270
I assumed that was since the deaths,
but was she always like that?

35:47.320 --> 35:48.710
I don't want to speak ill of her -

35:48.760 --> 35:50.670
not after everything
she's been through -

35:50.720 --> 35:55.950
~ but she always had a posh glass
of wine in her hand. Made sure
you knew it was expensive.
~ Right.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.230
Maybe it was because we
were renting off them,

35:58.280 --> 36:01.150
but I just... always felt
she was looking down on us.

36:01.200 --> 36:04.150
Well, me. Lee she just flirted with,
but everybody flirts with Lee

36:04.200 --> 36:06.870
and he just flirts right back, so...

36:07.120 --> 36:09.110
You don't think...

36:09.160 --> 36:11.430
Did they ever have a thing?

36:24.040 --> 36:26.040
I hate her.

36:27.840 --> 36:29.840
Sorry, but I do.

36:37.000 --> 36:40.510
He was never interested in her.
He's never looking to go older.

36:40.560 --> 36:43.160
Younger, maybe, but not Cate's age.

36:55.640 --> 36:58.040
Right, nearly finished!

36:59.640 --> 37:01.640
Thanks.

37:15.880 --> 37:17.880
Come on.

37:18.840 --> 37:21.240
Right. Get some old clothes on.

37:21.800 --> 37:24.510
~ What for?
~ First order of business,

37:24.560 --> 37:28.510
we're gonna paint the bedroom where
me and your dad used to sleep.

37:28.560 --> 37:32.150
~ I don't know how to paint.
~ Well, tonight's the night you'll learn.

37:32.200 --> 37:35.200
We're gonna do the whole
house eventually.

37:36.080 --> 37:38.310
This is ours, Tom.

37:38.360 --> 37:40.360
You, me and Fred.

37:47.600 --> 37:50.800
~ OK, just take it slow. Where are we going?
~ It's just here.

37:53.720 --> 37:56.460
~ This is where you live?
~ Don't start.

37:58.280 --> 38:00.280
Bloody hell, Alec.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.110
It's very quiet but it's only a six
or seven-minute walk into town.

38:08.160 --> 38:11.600
A five-minute walk to the beach.
Lovely area, great schools.

38:31.760 --> 38:33.760
We can't do this.

38:35.840 --> 38:37.840
Then what do we do?

38:44.880 --> 38:46.880
Are you warm enough?

38:51.400 --> 38:53.400
Right, two of these.

39:03.360 --> 39:05.360
Why did you come?

39:07.480 --> 39:09.480
Honestly?

39:11.080 --> 39:14.480
I thought if you had died
and I never said that...

39:19.080 --> 39:21.950
When the pendant was
stolen from my car -

39:22.000 --> 39:25.200
When you were shagging Dave
while we were still married.

39:26.360 --> 39:28.350
You took the blame.

39:28.400 --> 39:31.900
You covered for me, just
so I wouldn't get the rap.

39:32.400 --> 39:34.670
You're a good man, Alec.

39:34.720 --> 39:37.320
They would have ruined your career.

39:37.680 --> 39:40.280
I got away with mine... just.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.710
I just wanted you to know
I loved you for that.

39:43.760 --> 39:45.760
But not enough.

39:50.280 --> 39:52.680
Where are you staying tonight?

39:54.560 --> 39:57.360
~ On your sofa?
~ Have you seen that sofa?

40:00.520 --> 40:02.510
Oh, it's your daughter.

40:02.560 --> 40:04.960
Hey, Daze. Yeah, I'm with him.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.790
Pretty shit.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.110
No, much worse than normal.

40:10.480 --> 40:12.680
She wants to speak to you.

40:14.040 --> 40:16.040
Do you need me to...?

40:18.480 --> 40:20.960
Hi, darlin'. Fine.

40:21.360 --> 40:22.950
No, just a little bit of metal.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.510
It's the first step to being
the Six Million Dollar Man.

40:25.560 --> 40:30.790
What do you mean you've never heard
of the Six Million... What do they
teach you at that school?

40:30.840 --> 40:32.840
Yeah, it's all fixed.

40:34.400 --> 40:36.400
No more broken heart.

40:55.400 --> 40:57.390
What? You are kidding!

40:57.440 --> 41:00.080
~ Hi.
~ I don't want you in my house.

41:00.520 --> 41:03.110
Well, bad luck. I'm shagging
your son tonight.

41:03.160 --> 41:06.430
~ Where is he?
~ Sleeping. Snoring, hence me awake.

41:06.480 --> 41:08.110
Olly!

41:08.160 --> 41:11.310
~ You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
~ Oh, he's not that bad.

41:11.360 --> 41:14.350
~ I mean, what you're doing to this town.
~ I'm just doing my job.

41:14.400 --> 41:16.270
What, and you think
Joe's gonna get off?

41:16.320 --> 41:18.830
Do you think this whole trial's
gonna be over tomorrow?

41:18.880 --> 41:21.750
~ Hopefully, yeah.
~ I fucking hate lawyers.

41:22.120 --> 41:26.760
Olly! Olly, will you wake up and
get this woman out of my house?!

43:09.720 --> 43:13.960
No evidence was compromised, no
physical intimidation occurred.

43:14.640 --> 43:17.960
We have a sworn statement from
the officer who was present.

43:18.360 --> 43:20.910
My Lady, it was an
unfortunate incident

43:20.960 --> 43:23.830
but the process of justice
can still flow.

43:23.880 --> 43:27.080
This doesn't mean the defendant
cannot have a fair trial.

43:28.120 --> 43:31.310
There have clearly been failings
in this investigation

43:31.360 --> 43:33.430
and in the conduct of officers,

43:33.480 --> 43:35.030
but I am satisfied

43:35.080 --> 43:38.280
that the defendant can
indeed get a fair trial.

43:39.840 --> 43:43.120
So I'm going to refuse
the application.

43:46.560 --> 43:48.560
Thank you, My Lady.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.990
I'm not losing to her, Abby.

43:58.040 --> 44:00.840
We're gonna fight
till the bitter end.

44:01.320 --> 44:03.720
I think I might have something.

44:04.040 --> 44:06.040
It could be juicy.

44:08.160 --> 44:10.710
Well done! You got it back on track.

44:10.760 --> 44:12.910
The power of a good carbonara.

44:12.960 --> 44:16.070
Still a lot of work to
do. Oh, by the way...

44:16.120 --> 44:18.350
I got you both this.

44:18.400 --> 44:23.680
~ Wonders will never cease!
~ Yeah, well, thank you very much!

44:24.760 --> 44:28.120
~ Hello?
~ It's Andrew Darlington from the care home.

44:29.120 --> 44:31.510
Oh, I'm at work. Could
you call back later?

44:31.560 --> 44:34.320
Not really. Your mother had a fall.

44:35.320 --> 44:37.660
I-I'm afraid she passed away.

44:50.400 --> 44:52.190
Oh.

44:52.240 --> 44:54.640
I was expecting him to answer.

44:55.640 --> 44:58.960
~ He's asleep.
~ Listen, tell him the trial's still on.

44:59.800 --> 45:01.950
But, also - and you need
to know this, too -

45:02.000 --> 45:03.990
Claire Ripley showed me a photograph.

45:04.040 --> 45:06.510
She was wearing Pippa's pendant.

45:07.960 --> 45:09.950
Can you get hold of it?

45:10.000 --> 45:12.740
It's in her portfolio at the cottage.

45:24.920 --> 45:27.360
Not here. Someone might see.
