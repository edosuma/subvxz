WEBVTT

00:11.417 --> 00:13.077
They said he was
out the door in two weeks.

00:13.101 --> 00:14.801
Then I hear the guy's re-upped
for five years.

00:14.837 --> 00:15.838
The label hated it.

00:15.921 --> 00:18.215
This castle belongs
to the Duke of Gloucester.

00:18.298 --> 00:21.635
So I realize that was the guy who kept
angrily staring at me the whole time.

00:21.719 --> 00:23.471
Hey, Kevin. Hey, Lorne.

00:23.554 --> 00:25.194
- You ready for this?
- Yeah, what's that?

00:25.263 --> 00:26.823
Oh, oh! We're gonna do the thing. Okay.

00:26.849 --> 00:28.317
All right, you want to start it off?

00:28.341 --> 00:30.603
- Talk to you, or talk to the lens?
- Either way.

00:31.479 --> 00:33.814
So, Sandy Wexler...

00:37.109 --> 00:38.652
Where do I begin?

00:38.736 --> 00:40.988
He may be the most unique guy I ever met.

00:41.071 --> 00:44.617
If you were working in Los Angeles
in the '90s, any time in there,

00:44.700 --> 00:46.419
you'd run into Sandy Wexler at some point.

00:46.443 --> 00:48.537
Sandy was one of those
fringe Hollywood managers

00:48.621 --> 00:50.330
that you always sort of saw around.

00:50.413 --> 00:55.002
You know, you'd see him at a wrap party,
and he'd be laughing, stuffing his face.

00:55.085 --> 00:57.630
You'd think,
"No one even invited this guy."

00:57.713 --> 01:00.633
Sandy said I could be
the next Patrick Swayze.

01:00.716 --> 01:03.051
Only thing he ever said to me
that made sense.

01:03.135 --> 01:07.055
Sandy was not a big shot.
He was a... He was a tiny shot.

01:07.139 --> 01:11.434
But anybody who met him,
you never forgot him.

01:11.519 --> 01:14.647
You know, you gotta remember
there was no YouTube, there was no Vines.

01:14.730 --> 01:16.866
And none of that...
None of the social media platforms.

01:16.890 --> 01:18.734
You really needed a guy like Sandy
to be seen.

01:18.817 --> 01:23.030
Not Sandy.
Not Sandy, but a guy like Sandy.

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074

01:52.475 --> 01:57.147
Hey, Arsenio!
Nice to see you again, kiddo.

01:57.230 --> 01:58.649
Have I seen you before?

01:58.732 --> 02:01.234
Yeah, it's Sandy Wexler.

02:01.318 --> 02:05.113
I met you at Bernie's beach house,
with Doug and Danny.

02:05.197 --> 02:07.074
You guys were playing hangman.

02:07.157 --> 02:11.119
You were hysterical that night.
No one could figure out the word "canoe."

02:12.079 --> 02:13.956
I have no idea
what you're talking about, man.

02:14.039 --> 02:16.625
How you doing with your manager, kid?
Are you still fighting?

02:17.292 --> 02:18.627
I don't have a manager, man.

02:18.711 --> 02:21.254
Well, you do now. If you want one.

02:21.338 --> 02:23.006
No, I'm good. I... I have an agent.

02:23.090 --> 02:24.930
- Oh.
- As a matter of fact, I have six agents.

02:25.008 --> 02:26.194
Got plenty of white people in my life.

02:26.218 --> 02:27.278
- All right.
- I'm good, dawg.

02:27.302 --> 02:31.348
An agent is business. A manager is family.

02:31.431 --> 02:35.603
He guides you. He advises you.
He fights the good fights.

02:35.686 --> 02:37.229
Makes the tough phone calls.

02:37.312 --> 02:40.566
Truth is, I'm not happy unless...
unless you're happy.

02:40.649 --> 02:44.069
So what do you say, Arsenio?
You wanna get happy together?

02:46.279 --> 02:49.032
Continued success, Arsenio!

02:50.158 --> 02:52.661
Okay? Oh!

02:52.745 --> 02:55.413
I got a hit on the hip, and it's Sinbad.

02:55.497 --> 02:57.433
I don't think any of those people
were really beeping him.

02:57.457 --> 02:59.918
'Cause he would just go, like,
"Oh, jeez, Mackenzie Phillips."

03:00.002 --> 03:01.294
The one thing about Sandy is,

03:01.378 --> 03:04.089
- he just never stopped lying.
- Always.

03:04.172 --> 03:06.884
Managers get used to lying,
but Sandy took it to an art form.

03:06.967 --> 03:11.722
Where am I? I'm in Joel Silver's office
right now, talking about you.

03:11.805 --> 03:13.098
If you land on your feet...

03:13.181 --> 03:14.575
Hey, buddy, how long are you gonna be?

03:14.599 --> 03:17.770
Excuse me, I am talking
to Lew Wasserman's neighbor right now.

03:19.271 --> 03:21.732
That was Janet Maslin from the Times.

03:21.815 --> 03:23.025
Sandy's personal life?

03:23.108 --> 03:25.778
- I know nothing. I know nothing.
- Did he have a personal life?

03:25.861 --> 03:27.780
- He wasn't married.
- Didn't date.

03:27.863 --> 03:29.799
It was sad. Seemed like he
didn't have any friends, right?

03:29.823 --> 03:30.823
He had no friends.

03:35.996 --> 03:37.039
Any good?

03:41.669 --> 03:43.629
No, no, no, no, no, no.

03:47.257 --> 03:48.550
That's great.

03:50.302 --> 03:54.097
But he was
the king of the fake laugh

03:54.181 --> 03:56.809
- and the applauding combo. Yeah.
- Combo. Yeah.

04:00.020 --> 04:02.147
Next time he'll get his own ketchup.

04:04.692 --> 04:05.693
You gotta go.

04:05.776 --> 04:07.903
Is Mary Jo Slater
the casting agent on this?

04:07.986 --> 04:09.338
- No. I don't know.
- Good job, guys.

04:09.362 --> 04:12.615
I was in Nam.
But, you know, I was there in 1984,

04:12.700 --> 04:15.327
so it was... It was a different vibe.

04:19.164 --> 04:20.644
And then all I hear in the back is...

04:23.919 --> 04:26.588
- He would fake laugh at funny comics.
- That melon.

04:26.672 --> 04:28.716
It was like, "Why are you fake laughing?"

04:28.799 --> 04:30.479
- "It's Eddie Murphy. He's funny."
- Right!

04:30.550 --> 04:33.053
When it came to eating
with Sandy, he, um...

04:33.136 --> 04:35.222
It was like a smorgasbord on his face.

04:35.305 --> 04:38.391
I mean, he was on the Atkins diet, right?
So he always had, like, chicken...

04:38.475 --> 04:40.102
- Kielbasa.
- T-bone steak.

04:40.185 --> 04:41.519
- Brisket.
- Beef jerky.

04:41.603 --> 04:44.522
I never actually ate with Sandy,
but I did hear it was kind of gross.

04:46.441 --> 04:48.235
Can you close your mouth
just a little bit?

04:50.362 --> 04:51.822
What did I do?

04:51.905 --> 04:54.742
He dressed like your grandfather,

04:54.825 --> 04:59.788
he had the table manners of a horse,
but he was a great manager.

04:59.872 --> 05:01.957
He really cared about his clients.

05:02.040 --> 05:04.793
He made them his family.
He was with them all the time.

05:04.877 --> 05:08.005
And, uh, I wasn't sure
what he was doing for them,

05:08.088 --> 05:09.208
but you could feel the love.

05:09.715 --> 05:13.886
I spoke to Chili's. I think I can
get us the corner table there

05:13.969 --> 05:15.470
and preorder the appetizers.

05:15.553 --> 05:17.198
I don't give a shit
about Chili's right now.

05:17.222 --> 05:18.742
I thought you wanted to go to Chili's.

05:18.807 --> 05:20.407
- No, I never said that.
- You said that.

05:20.475 --> 05:21.769
That's okay.

05:21.852 --> 05:24.229
You're nervous.
I can see that you're sweating.

05:24.312 --> 05:25.605
- I'm scared, Sandy.
- Yeah.

05:25.688 --> 05:27.816
I gotta jump over ten trailers
and land on a waterbed.

05:29.735 --> 05:30.986
Why are you laughing?

05:31.069 --> 05:33.030
Because you're funny.
You make me laugh.

05:33.113 --> 05:35.466
- Well, I'm not trying to be funny.
- No, it's the way you said it.

05:35.490 --> 05:37.325
The way I said...
What are you...

05:37.409 --> 05:38.994
Look at the size of this crowd.

05:41.246 --> 05:43.081
You said they'd come, and they came.

05:43.165 --> 05:48.336
Ladies and gentlemen
of El Segundo Motor Home Court,

05:48.420 --> 05:50.297
here to defy gravity,

05:50.380 --> 05:56.553
please let's welcome Wild Gary Roberts!

05:56.636 --> 05:58.638
- Rodgers!
- Rodgers!

06:00.348 --> 06:01.975
He said that. He said Rodgers.

06:02.059 --> 06:03.601
Yeah, 'cause I told him to!

06:03.685 --> 06:05.062
He said it the first time.

06:05.645 --> 06:09.441
I... I wish we could...
'Cause he did say it the first time.

06:09.524 --> 06:12.235
- Stop talking.
- All right. I will.

06:12.319 --> 06:14.863
You get up there
and you show these people who you are.

06:14.947 --> 06:16.949
Gary Rodgers.

06:17.032 --> 06:18.951
It's Gary Rodgers. You said that, right?

06:19.034 --> 06:20.077
The second time.

06:20.160 --> 06:21.661
Yeah, but you knew it.

06:21.744 --> 06:23.413
Okay, guys, let's do this.

06:33.673 --> 06:35.926
What are you saying?
I don't know what you're...

06:38.345 --> 06:41.389
What are you pointing to?
I can only go forward.

06:45.768 --> 06:47.312
Oh, my God.

06:47.896 --> 06:50.398
He's really gonna jump
over all those trailers?

06:50.482 --> 06:53.735
Sir, my client is the best daredevil
trapeze artist in the world.

06:53.818 --> 06:54.903
Thank you very much.

06:55.653 --> 06:57.572
Let's go.

06:58.531 --> 06:59.531
Yeah!

07:00.283 --> 07:01.869
What?

07:05.622 --> 07:07.082
Oh, shit!

07:07.165 --> 07:09.709
Jesus Christ!

07:10.627 --> 07:11.879
Sandy.

07:13.255 --> 07:15.423
- He had this one guy, Ted Rafferty...
- Oh, yeah.

07:15.507 --> 07:18.426
Who was a, you know, puppet act.
Not that good. Like, a middle act.

07:18.510 --> 07:20.512
He believed in him.
He thought he was the greatest.

07:20.595 --> 07:23.223
He's like, "I'm gonna make him
the next Mr. Buttons."

07:24.933 --> 07:27.936
So, uh, Charlie,
have you always been a puppet?

07:28.020 --> 07:30.939
Well, I don't know.
Have you always been a parade float?

07:32.565 --> 07:34.734
I'm just trying
to get to know you better, that's all.

07:34.817 --> 07:37.070
Know me better?
I'm sitting on your lap.

07:38.405 --> 07:40.615
No, but seriously,
what's it like being a puppet?

07:40.698 --> 07:42.492
Well, I come from a long line of puppets.

07:42.575 --> 07:46.079
My father was a puppet.
My father's father was a puppet.

07:46.163 --> 07:48.790
Really? Was your father's father's
father a puppet?

07:51.293 --> 07:53.586
Wait for the punch line, buddy.

07:56.423 --> 08:00.260
Somebody call JCPenney.
One of the mannequins is on the loose.

08:02.971 --> 08:04.681
Sir, have you ever had
a date in your life?

08:04.764 --> 08:06.308
Actually, I have.

08:06.391 --> 08:08.685
Your Anita Bryant poster doesn't count.

08:12.772 --> 08:15.525
But honestly, sir,
how long have you been dead for?

08:20.113 --> 08:24.076
Where do you come up with this stuff?
I wish you didn't.

08:24.159 --> 08:25.911
That was hysterical.

08:25.994 --> 08:27.346
So you caught the whole show, then?

08:27.370 --> 08:30.082
I saw every word of it.
It was sensational.

08:30.165 --> 08:31.666
I saw you come in late!

08:31.749 --> 08:34.294
Nah. Nah, I was there the whole time.

08:34.376 --> 08:36.087
Will you get a load of this bullcrap.

08:36.171 --> 08:38.465
I was. I was.

08:38.548 --> 08:40.467
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
now, guys, guys, please.

08:40.549 --> 08:42.219
All right. Sandy, I... I believe you.

08:42.302 --> 08:43.510
Thank you, Ted.

08:43.595 --> 08:48.058
And I was thinking, you'd do so well now
with the beach theater crowd.

08:48.141 --> 08:52.770
And you've got the once a month gig
opening for Fred Travalena at the Trop.

08:52.854 --> 08:54.356
I don't wanna lose that.

08:54.439 --> 08:56.942
It might be time
to move on to the next level.

08:57.025 --> 08:58.860
Kicking the piss out of you?

08:58.944 --> 09:01.738
No. Television.

09:02.864 --> 09:03.949
But...

09:04.032 --> 09:06.409
I don't know the first thing
about the TV business.

09:06.493 --> 09:07.577
That's why you got me.

09:07.660 --> 09:09.912
- I know my way around the networks.
- Liar!

09:09.997 --> 09:13.416
Hey, I've had a relationship
with CBS since 1965

09:13.500 --> 09:15.418
when I was a PA on Gilligan's Island.

09:15.502 --> 09:19.672
Now, look, kids love the puppets.
And I know there's an audience for that.

09:19.756 --> 09:21.091
Mmm, maybe.

09:22.009 --> 09:23.676
Well, what about this?

09:23.760 --> 09:27.347
I know it's out of left field,
but how about a show for kids?

09:28.056 --> 09:29.557
Yeah, I was just saying that.

09:29.641 --> 09:31.143
So we agree.

09:32.685 --> 09:35.188
My favorite thing about Sandy
is where he lived.

09:35.272 --> 09:36.814
The place was a palace.

09:36.898 --> 09:39.026
He lived
on the biggest property in Bel Air.

09:39.109 --> 09:40.110
Yeah.

09:40.193 --> 09:41.486
Gorgeous pool.

09:41.569 --> 09:44.531
One of the finest collections
of luxury cars I've ever seen.

09:45.115 --> 09:48.618
Make sure you hydrate, Yoshi!
It's a hot day!

09:51.454 --> 09:53.623
Of course,
none of it belonged to Sandy.

09:53.706 --> 09:55.708
It was owned by some Jewish Iranian...

09:55.792 --> 09:58.836
The guy never even set foot
in the United States.

09:58.920 --> 10:01.256
Who needed Sandy there
for legal reasons.

10:01.339 --> 10:04.967
And he was not allowed in the main house.

10:05.052 --> 10:07.637
He was in the cabana by the pool.

10:07.720 --> 10:10.807
No, no, no, no.

10:11.933 --> 10:15.270
Oh, no! Oh, no, no! No, no, no!

10:15.353 --> 10:17.272
Stay! Stay! Stay!

10:18.981 --> 10:23.153
I've lived here for four years already.
You should know me by now.

10:23.236 --> 10:25.863
Get to see the face.
The king of Hollywood.

10:25.947 --> 10:26.948
Do you understand me?

10:27.032 --> 10:28.450
- Sandy?
- Ahh!

10:29.659 --> 10:33.913
Oh. Hi, uh, Amy.
Hi, Donna and Kendra.

10:33.996 --> 10:35.540
- Lola.
- Jesse.

10:35.623 --> 10:39.044
Yeah, that's right.
Wow, they're getting sharp.

10:39.127 --> 10:42.004
What brings you all the way out here
from Tarzana?

10:42.089 --> 10:44.317
Well, you said you'd watch the kids
while I go on the audition.

10:44.341 --> 10:45.342
Is that still okay?

10:45.425 --> 10:51.264
Oh, don't be silly. Of course.
We're gonna have a good time, guys.

10:51.348 --> 10:52.432
I have to get it, Sandy.

10:52.515 --> 10:54.809
I'm working two jobs
just to tread water out here.

10:54.892 --> 10:59.647
You're the quintessential American mother.
Oscar Mayer would be crazy to pass on you.

10:59.731 --> 11:03.735
Oscar Mayer? I thought I was auditioning
to play a hooker in a Wes Craven movie.

11:03.818 --> 11:07.197
You know what? My doctor put me
on a new thyroid medicine.

11:07.280 --> 11:10.283
He said it might make me foggy,
and I guess he was right.

11:11.284 --> 11:12.827
- Okay, Sandy, I'm gonna go.
- Yeah.

11:12.910 --> 11:14.704
Girls, be nice to Mr. Wexler. Okay?

11:14.787 --> 11:15.788
Yes, Mommy.

11:15.872 --> 11:17.624
- Oh, we're gonna have fun, guys.
- Okay.

11:17.707 --> 11:19.876
- Go get 'em, kid. Go get 'em.
- Okay.

11:20.960 --> 11:22.837
Oh, there's dogs out there. They...

11:22.920 --> 11:27.342
Hey! Hi, guys. Hi, sweet girl. Hi.

11:28.301 --> 11:30.303
So what are you shmegegges up for?

11:30.387 --> 11:33.848
I have the original script
of On Golden Pond.

11:33.931 --> 11:35.933
Do you wanna read that out loud?

11:36.017 --> 11:37.059
No?

11:37.144 --> 11:38.561
What would you like to do?

11:38.645 --> 11:39.729
Go swimming?

11:39.812 --> 11:42.440
No, no, no.
That could get me kicked out of here.

11:42.524 --> 11:44.042
I thought you were the king of Hollywood?

11:44.066 --> 11:45.152
I never said that.

11:45.235 --> 11:47.945
- You said it to the dogs.
- Like a minute ago.

11:48.029 --> 11:49.029
No, I didn't.

11:50.198 --> 11:52.617
You guys like roller coasters?

11:53.493 --> 11:55.703
Unbelievable.

11:55.787 --> 12:00.458
Rifkin left Triad and he's joining forces
with Zifkin over at William Morris.

12:00.542 --> 12:07.299
After I was promoted out of the mailroom
at MCA, I was assigned to Frank Gorshin.

12:07.382 --> 12:12.345
And Frank Gorshin used to have me
hand-wash the Riddler costume,

12:12.429 --> 12:17.684
because he felt washing machines
might stretch out the material.

12:19.018 --> 12:22.522

Excuse me.
You were fantastic up there.

13:22.499 --> 13:24.501
- Oh, thanks. You're sweet.
- Yeah.

13:24.584 --> 13:25.793
It's corny, but it's fun.

13:25.877 --> 13:28.630
Corny? That had an edge to it.
I'm Sandy Wexler.

13:28.713 --> 13:30.757
Courtney. Nice to meet you.

13:30.840 --> 13:33.343
I just... I couldn't keep
my eyes off you up there.

13:33.426 --> 13:35.970
Please don't hit on me
in front of your kids. That's creepy.

13:36.053 --> 13:37.764
- He's not our dad.
- No, I'm not.

13:37.847 --> 13:38.927
He's the king of Hollywood.

13:38.973 --> 13:41.476
She thinks I said that to the dogs,
but I didn't.

13:41.559 --> 13:44.020
Listen, can we talk somewhere?
I'm a talent manager.

13:44.103 --> 13:46.230
I kinda gotta go.
We have a show every 12 minutes.

13:46.314 --> 13:48.733
It'll take four minutes of your time.
It'll be worth it.

13:52.445 --> 13:56.115
Someone who advises you,
someone who guides you,

13:56.198 --> 14:00.412
who makes the tough phone calls,
fights the big fights.

14:01.037 --> 14:02.038
Atkins.

14:03.623 --> 14:05.207
I mean, your voice,

14:05.292 --> 14:08.878
it sounds like a...
a bird and an angel had a baby.

14:10.046 --> 14:12.256
And you just so happen to be beautiful.

14:12.882 --> 14:14.426
You can't teach beautiful.

14:14.509 --> 14:17.804
If you could, I'd be in class right now,
believe me.

14:19.096 --> 14:21.098
I'm telling you, you could be somebody.

14:21.683 --> 14:24.519
Come on. If I was gonna be anybody,
I'd be her by now.

14:25.186 --> 14:27.021
Everybody's gotta start somewhere.

14:27.104 --> 14:31.150
Buddy Hackett was a dishwasher
in the Catskills till he was 60.

14:31.233 --> 14:35.071
Barbra Streisand started
as a backup singer in a petting zoo.

14:35.154 --> 14:38.283
Liza Minnelli used to sing in a coal mine.

14:38.866 --> 14:40.410
Wasn't her mother Judy Garland?

14:40.493 --> 14:42.078
No, that's made up.

14:43.079 --> 14:46.708
The mightiest tornado
starts with a small breeze.

14:46.791 --> 14:48.543
You sound like a fortune cookie.

14:48.626 --> 14:50.962
I used to represent a guy
who wrote fortune cookies.

14:51.045 --> 14:52.630
Get out of here.

14:52.714 --> 14:55.174
Yeah, he wrote for Happy Days
and fortune cookies.

14:56.133 --> 14:57.134
Let me ask you something.

14:58.970 --> 15:00.597
Why do you do what you do?

15:01.764 --> 15:03.308
I don't know.

15:03.391 --> 15:06.311
The only time I really feel alive
is when I'm singing.

15:06.394 --> 15:10.732
Well, imagine if you were singing
on stage in front of 50,000 people.

15:10.815 --> 15:12.567
You think you'd feel alive then?

15:13.192 --> 15:16.654
Up there singing like a bird
and an angel had a baby?

15:17.238 --> 15:19.198
You like the bird and angel thing,
don't you?

15:19.281 --> 15:20.825
I said that already?

15:20.908 --> 15:22.952
- Can I ask you something?
- Please do.

15:23.035 --> 15:24.912
Can you get any of that food
in your mouth?

15:27.081 --> 15:32.462
So you're saying I should quit right now
and leave with you?

15:32.545 --> 15:35.590
You're too big for this duck pond.
It's time to fly.

15:37.049 --> 15:38.968
You like to make trouble,
don't you, Sandy?

15:40.219 --> 15:42.013
What do you say? Wanna team up?

15:42.597 --> 15:46.308
I'll tell you what I told Josh Gelfand
in the sixth grade

15:46.393 --> 15:48.686
- when he asked me to the spring social.
- Uh-huh.

15:48.770 --> 15:51.022
I'd love to,
but we gotta ask my dad first.

15:51.105 --> 15:53.315
Ooh!

15:56.653 --> 15:59.447
I guess I should have mentioned
my Dad's in Seward, Alaska.

15:59.531 --> 16:01.282
Oh, that's fine. I love it there.

16:01.366 --> 16:02.200
It's beautiful.

16:02.283 --> 16:04.494
- Oh, you've been?
- No, I haven't been there.

16:05.453 --> 16:06.933
- But you just said...
- No, I didn't.

16:08.039 --> 16:10.417
I guess I should have also
mentioned the prison thing.

16:10.500 --> 16:11.501
Are you kidding?

16:11.584 --> 16:14.879
I was in prison my entire childhood.

16:14.962 --> 16:19.175
An emotional prison.
That's a life sentence, I'm telling you.

16:19.801 --> 16:24.180
- The Yugo, imported from France.
- Isn't it from Yugoslavia?

16:24.263 --> 16:30.520
No. "You go" to France.
"You go" and have a good time. Bonjour.

16:34.065 --> 16:35.650
Hey, Poppy.

16:35.733 --> 16:37.109
How you doing?

16:37.193 --> 16:39.487
Oh, it's always a great day
when I see my little girl.

16:39.571 --> 16:44.116
Mr. Clarke, truly a pleasure.
Sandy Wexler of Wexler Artists.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.952
Is this the fool that want to manage you?

16:46.536 --> 16:49.872
Um, yes, I did come up here
to talk to you about that.

16:49.956 --> 16:54.043
And if you're available
to speak, you know, and now's the time,

16:54.126 --> 16:56.588
I would love to have
a conversation about this.

16:56.671 --> 16:58.590
If we could conversate, I'm here to...

16:58.673 --> 17:00.758
What about Six Flags Magic Mountain?

17:01.884 --> 17:04.637
I mean, she got benefits,
a paycheck every week.

17:04.721 --> 17:06.137
That mountain is truly magical.

17:06.222 --> 17:07.263
No, it is.

17:07.348 --> 17:11.268
I just, with all due respect,
I think your daughter has the magic.

17:11.352 --> 17:15.607
With her talent,
she could have a dream-come-true life.

17:15.690 --> 17:17.108
You mean, better than all of this?

17:18.818 --> 17:19.818
What?

17:21.278 --> 17:22.614
Dad.

17:23.321 --> 17:24.491
Who else have you managed?

17:24.574 --> 17:27.117
You ever hear of Indiana Jones?

17:27.201 --> 17:28.703
You work with Harrison Ford?

17:28.786 --> 17:31.122
No, but I do represent the guy

17:31.205 --> 17:34.166
who got his heart pulled out of his chest
in Temple of Doom.

17:34.250 --> 17:35.334
I love that guy.

17:35.417 --> 17:36.919
Everybody does.

17:37.003 --> 17:39.672
I don't know anything
about show business, Sandy.

17:39.756 --> 17:41.066
How do I know if I can trust you?

17:41.090 --> 17:45.762
Because I can look you dead in the eye
and promise you this:

17:46.471 --> 17:50.432
I will always do what's best
for your daughter.

17:55.605 --> 17:57.273
Well, okay. In that case...

18:07.617 --> 18:10.036
Okay. Good. Will do...
Will never do it again.

18:10.119 --> 18:12.329
You guys want to go out and celebrate?

18:12.413 --> 18:13.706
I can't go nowhere.

18:13.790 --> 18:17.001
Oh, that's right. I'm sorry.
Please don't shiv me.

18:17.084 --> 18:21.338
Shiv you? Man, I ain't no inmate. I work
here. I've got... got the night shift.

18:21.422 --> 18:23.675
What the... What?

18:23.758 --> 18:24.926
Got ya.

18:25.009 --> 18:27.053
Oh! Ha!

18:27.136 --> 18:28.137
Very good.

18:28.220 --> 18:32.391
Darling, you should take Sandy out
for a dinner and a show, Alaskan style.

18:34.894 --> 18:37.522
- That's amazing.
- Right?

18:37.605 --> 18:38.815
So good.

18:38.898 --> 18:43.110
The northern lights
and my new friend Sandy.

18:43.194 --> 18:44.612
That's as good as it gets.

18:45.487 --> 18:47.489
Northern lights are something else.

18:47.574 --> 18:49.384
I was actually talking
about the burger, though.

18:49.408 --> 18:51.786
Is this bison, or is it moose meat?

18:51.869 --> 18:53.621
What's making it so good?

18:53.705 --> 18:55.790
It's a hamburger, crazy man.

18:55.873 --> 18:58.018
- A hamburger?
- And you're missing out without the bun.

18:58.042 --> 18:59.418
Now, the bun...

18:59.501 --> 19:01.629
If I lose five more pounds,
it's back to the buns.

19:01.713 --> 19:02.714
Oh, my God.

19:05.091 --> 19:07.218
So you really think I could be somebody?

19:07.802 --> 19:10.471
- You are going straight to the top.
- Yeah?

19:10.555 --> 19:12.807
Up there
with all the other beautiful stars.

19:13.641 --> 19:14.892
Show me which star I am.

19:14.976 --> 19:17.186
- You wanna know which star you are?
- Yeah.

19:17.269 --> 19:18.354
Let's see.

19:18.437 --> 19:21.065
You are that one right there.

19:21.148 --> 19:22.900
Sandy, that's an airplane.

19:23.525 --> 19:26.362
I know. I told you, you were going places.

19:26.445 --> 19:29.448
- That's real smooth, Sandy.
- Thank you.

19:29.531 --> 19:31.450
You must be a real lady-killer.

19:31.533 --> 19:32.910
Listen,

19:32.994 --> 19:36.247
if we're gonna do business together,
we gotta have boundaries.

19:36.330 --> 19:38.708
I'm sorry,
but I learned that the hard way.

19:38.791 --> 19:40.292
A bad breakup?

19:41.335 --> 19:42.920
His name was Alfred.

19:43.004 --> 19:44.964
Oh, you're gay!

19:46.173 --> 19:47.299
I can see that now.

19:47.383 --> 19:49.594
No, I'm not gay as far as I know.

19:50.970 --> 19:54.015
- Alfred was my first client.
- Mmm-hmm.

19:54.098 --> 19:56.601
More than that.
He was... He was my best friend.

19:56.684 --> 19:57.894
Did he die?

19:57.977 --> 19:59.186
No, no.

20:00.521 --> 20:04.400
He got famous, and he, uh...
and he dumped me.

20:05.234 --> 20:06.235
That dick!

20:06.318 --> 20:09.864
He wasn't a dick.
I was the dick. It was my fault.

20:09.947 --> 20:13.117
I let the friendship
get in the way of the business.

20:13.200 --> 20:17.121
Now understand it's show business,
not show friendship. Right?

20:17.204 --> 20:18.831
That is so sad.

20:18.915 --> 20:21.375
It's not sad. It's actually a good thing.

20:21.458 --> 20:25.379
Because I got a stable of talent
in Hollywood

20:25.462 --> 20:29.050
that I, quite frankly,
think is the best of the bunch.

20:29.133 --> 20:32.428
And Eisner knows it, and Ovitch knows it.

20:33.429 --> 20:35.932
I'm sorry,
and I don't wanna toot my own horn

20:36.015 --> 20:38.893
'cause that's not what I like to do,
but toot-toot.

20:39.601 --> 20:40.728
Hmm.

20:40.812 --> 20:43.522
Best thing to me is I found you.

20:45.066 --> 20:46.442
I'm glad you found me.

20:46.525 --> 20:49.028
You're not as happy as I am.
Trust me.

20:49.611 --> 20:51.572
But we gotta get to work.

20:51.656 --> 20:53.449
Whenever Sandy signed a new client,

20:53.532 --> 20:57.662
he had a team of support people that
immediately began making over the client.

20:57.745 --> 21:01.165
He would just enroll everybody
in classes for the stuff they didn't do.

21:01.248 --> 21:03.167
Movement, martial arts...

21:03.250 --> 21:05.962
A posture person, and then a hair person.

21:06.045 --> 21:08.339
- And no one was better off after that.
- No.

21:08.422 --> 21:09.423
It was a train wreck.

21:09.506 --> 21:10.675
I'm not a dancer, Sandy.

21:10.758 --> 21:12.998
- It doesn't matter if you can't dance.
- It's all right.

21:13.052 --> 21:16.013
- Miss Gideon is gonna teach you to move.
- I got you, sweetheart.

21:16.097 --> 21:18.491
- It's about presence on stage.
- All right. That's enough, Sandy.

21:18.515 --> 21:20.327
- All right. Here we go.
- It's about being comfortable.

21:20.351 --> 21:23.062
- You know, Baryshnikov, I hear...
- Shut it, Sandy. I got her.

21:23.145 --> 21:26.565
Who me? Who me? Who me?

21:26.648 --> 21:28.609
I'm a rock star. I'm a rock star.

21:28.693 --> 21:32.822
And pass the mic. Pass the mic.
Down the mic. Down the mic.

21:32.905 --> 21:34.240
That's it. That's it.

21:34.323 --> 21:36.083
- That's it. Now you're in it.
- Bobby Brown.

21:36.158 --> 21:38.285
More madness! Stomp the ant.

21:38.369 --> 21:39.912
Seattle. Seattle.

21:40.913 --> 21:43.750
- She doesn't know how to dance?
- You're a diva!

21:43.833 --> 21:46.878
- This girl can do it all.
- Feel it. And stop!

21:46.961 --> 21:48.129
Hammer time!

21:52.049 --> 21:53.801
Wonderful.

21:53.885 --> 21:55.845
Okay. Let's see it.

21:56.888 --> 21:58.680
Very good.

22:00.057 --> 22:01.058
Very bad.

22:01.976 --> 22:03.519
Complete shit.

22:03.602 --> 22:07.857
You know what? I don't like the ice cream.
It's a bad idea. Looks terrible.

22:07.940 --> 22:11.402
Now let's go sexy, huh?
Can you give me some sexy, Courtney?

22:11.485 --> 22:13.285
Come on.
Let's put on some sexy music, Willow.

22:17.158 --> 22:21.662
Okay. Yes. Let's shoop this shit.
Shoop it up, huh?

22:21.745 --> 22:24.832
Let's shoop the shoop.
Show me the sexy. Come on.

22:24.916 --> 22:26.375
Give me sexy.

22:26.458 --> 22:28.585
Honey, think of something sexy, huh?

22:28.669 --> 22:30.963
- Like what?
- Like moose burgers.

22:31.047 --> 22:32.548
And there it is. Shoot that.

22:33.174 --> 22:36.760
Ah, Sandy likes it. No one knows why.

22:36.844 --> 22:38.429
Put your hand on your chin.

22:39.721 --> 22:41.348
Not like you're stroking a beard.

22:41.432 --> 22:44.143
Like you're thinking,
thinking filthy thoughts.

22:44.226 --> 22:45.895
Like wieners!

22:45.978 --> 22:49.565
Ah, that's good, Willow!
Wieners is good. You're brilliant today.

22:49.648 --> 22:51.818
Come on. Hand on chin,
thinking of wieners.

22:52.734 --> 22:53.735
I suck at this.

22:53.820 --> 22:55.255
- No, you don't. You're great.
- Oh, come on.

22:55.279 --> 22:57.281
It... You just... It's easy.

22:57.364 --> 22:58.490
Then you do it, Sandy.

22:58.574 --> 22:59.968
- Come on. Get over here.
- No, no, no, no.

22:59.992 --> 23:02.995
- You're a performer. I don't do that.
- Come on, Sandy.

23:03.079 --> 23:05.331
You said it's easy.
Dream of the wieners, huh?

23:05.414 --> 23:06.665
Come over here. Come on.

23:06.748 --> 23:08.750
Do I wear my glasses,
or do I take them off? Or...

23:08.835 --> 23:10.419
Nobody gives a shit. Come on.

23:11.378 --> 23:13.422
Eh...

23:13.505 --> 23:16.300
- You put your hand on the chin.
- Uh-huh.

23:16.383 --> 23:18.052
You just... You think.

23:20.137 --> 23:23.682
Huh? Just thinking.
Little more thinking over here.

23:24.350 --> 23:26.310
Yes, that's brilliant.

23:26.393 --> 23:30.064
Beautiful. Thank you, Sandy.
Clear out of frame.

23:30.147 --> 23:32.024
- Get out.
- No, I'm gonna miss him.

23:32.608 --> 23:35.111
No, you'll be fine.
Sexy will be right over here.

23:35.194 --> 23:36.403
- Don't worry.
- I'll be there.

23:36.487 --> 23:38.822
He's still got his hand on his chin.
He's so cute.

23:39.406 --> 23:41.200
Ah, that's much better.

23:41.283 --> 23:43.202
Yes, that's it.

23:43.285 --> 23:45.246
Yes, now I see sexy.

23:51.460 --> 23:53.880
The definition of, like, a given

23:53.963 --> 23:56.382
is that kids wake up
and they think, "Me so horny."

23:56.465 --> 24:00.177
And then, you know, you don't need
a song that just reinforces,

24:00.261 --> 24:01.595
they know they're so horny.

24:01.678 --> 24:04.118
If it was, like, "Me So Introspective"
or something like that.

24:04.181 --> 24:06.475
Or "Me So Ambivalent" or...

24:06.558 --> 24:07.894
Just so good.

24:07.977 --> 24:11.522
Talk about fearless. Best in town by far.

24:11.605 --> 24:13.274
Isn't she?

24:13.357 --> 24:14.483
She? Who's she?

24:15.276 --> 24:16.277
What?

24:16.903 --> 24:19.405
- Did you call him?
- Yeah, I called him.

24:19.488 --> 24:20.656
What'd he say?

24:22.158 --> 24:24.911
- What'd who say?
- The guy you called.

24:24.994 --> 24:26.412
Who did I call?

24:26.996 --> 24:29.498
The guy from the Young Comedians Special.

24:29.581 --> 24:31.918
Oh, yeah. No, I gotta call him.

24:32.001 --> 24:34.795
- So you didn't call him?
- No, I called him.

24:34.878 --> 24:36.130
No, you didn't.

24:36.213 --> 24:37.589
I thought you called him.

24:37.673 --> 24:40.051
Sandy, you're making
even less sense than usual.

24:40.134 --> 24:41.010
No, I'm not.

24:41.093 --> 24:43.095
- Something's off.
- Off how?

24:43.179 --> 24:45.806
I don't know. Different.

24:46.933 --> 24:48.333
Did you dye your hair or something?

24:48.809 --> 24:49.893
I don't think so.

24:49.977 --> 24:51.520
Maybe it's a brain tumor.

24:51.603 --> 24:53.105
Maybe it is.

24:53.189 --> 24:56.692
- Anyway, can we run lines?
- Yeah, that's why I'm here.

24:58.319 --> 25:00.612
I need to know the truth,
you son of a bitch!

25:00.696 --> 25:04.366
All right, I dyed my hair.
Just the tips. You happy?

25:04.450 --> 25:06.202
No, the line, Sandy.

25:06.868 --> 25:08.955
I know. I was improvising.

25:09.038 --> 25:11.332
But you want this line? Um...

25:11.415 --> 25:16.128
"The truth? You wouldn't know the truth
if it bit you on the..."

25:16.212 --> 25:17.504
Bird.

25:17.588 --> 25:19.715
We gotta find a way.
Don't you think, Sandy?

25:20.799 --> 25:22.051
Sandy?

25:22.134 --> 25:24.053
A way? What way?

25:24.136 --> 25:26.013
A way to get rid of the birds.

25:26.097 --> 25:29.516
Yeah, a bird and a baby had an angel.

25:30.101 --> 25:31.435
Are you stoned or something?

25:31.518 --> 25:34.313
Stoned? I don't do pot. Come on.

25:34.396 --> 25:38.442
Well, you seem stoned out of your mind.
What's with the crazy smile?

25:38.525 --> 25:43.280
I don't know, I'm just smiling at the fact
you might become the new Captain Kangaroo.

25:43.364 --> 25:44.740
He's lying again.

25:44.823 --> 25:46.367
No, I'm not. I'm not lying.

25:46.450 --> 25:50.579
I've been thinking about how you
can work on your kid-friendly material.

25:50.662 --> 25:52.206
Maybe go to Magic Mountain.

25:52.289 --> 25:55.084
When you see all the children on line,
just start doing jokes for 'em.

25:55.167 --> 25:57.461
- See if it works.
- That feels very child molestery.

25:57.544 --> 26:00.006
He wants to ruin you. Fire him!

26:00.089 --> 26:02.299
Fire me?
If you're firing anybody, I'd fire him.

26:02.383 --> 26:04.051
He's useless. He does nothing.

26:04.135 --> 26:06.012
I do everything! What do you do?

26:06.095 --> 26:08.115
Guys, guys, guys!
Come on, we're on the same team here.

26:08.139 --> 26:09.973
- That's what I'm trying to tell him.
- Yes.

26:10.057 --> 26:11.267
Teammates?

26:12.184 --> 26:13.435
Yeah, thank you.

26:14.811 --> 26:17.981
- You took my arm! You took my arm!
- Oh, come off it. That's...

26:18.065 --> 26:20.026
- You took my arm!
- That's not...

26:20.109 --> 26:21.735
Thank you, Martin.

26:21.818 --> 26:26.157
Let's find out who the judges chose
as returning champ tonight.

26:26.740 --> 26:30.494
The judges gave Kevin Connors one star

26:30.577 --> 26:34.164
and the champion,
Martin Lawrence, four stars!

26:34.248 --> 26:35.957
The new champion, Martin Lawrence.

26:37.167 --> 26:40.087
Oh... Come on.

26:40.879 --> 26:42.214
Wexler Artists.

26:42.298 --> 26:44.175
- It's me.
- Hi, Kevin.

26:44.258 --> 26:45.301
Did you know that was on?

26:45.384 --> 26:47.844
No. I didn't know
they were gonna repeat it.

26:47.928 --> 26:49.572
- I never want to see that again!
- Well...

26:49.596 --> 26:53.684
I can't stop them, Kevin, legally,
'cause we signed an agreement.

26:53.767 --> 26:55.519
It's... They own the material.

27:14.121 --> 27:16.332
Well, she'd light up a room
in that purple one.

27:26.800 --> 27:27.884
Sandy!

27:28.427 --> 27:30.387
Barry Bubatzi.

27:31.054 --> 27:32.055
Barry.

27:32.889 --> 27:35.726
Yeah, I was
Carr D'Angelo's assistant?

27:36.310 --> 27:39.188
- Hiccups? That's you?
- Yeah.

27:39.271 --> 27:41.815
- Look at this. Hiccups.
- Yeah.

27:41.898 --> 27:43.192
Bubatzi!

27:43.275 --> 27:44.943
He... he called me Hiccups

27:45.026 --> 27:47.547
because I had the hiccups this one time
I was on the phone with him.

27:47.571 --> 27:49.341
Well, listen,
he didn't just have the hiccups,

27:49.365 --> 27:50.657
he had the hiccups.

27:50.741 --> 27:52.576
- He wouldn't stop hiccupping.
- Yeah.

27:52.659 --> 27:56.122
Uh, you can die from hiccups.
I was terrified.

27:56.205 --> 27:57.873
I was actually concerned.

27:57.956 --> 28:01.168
It was nerve-racking. A little bit.

28:01.252 --> 28:04.338
How's your sister?
Did she get into Penn State?

28:04.421 --> 28:07.549
- She just graduated.
- Another successful Bubatzi.

28:07.633 --> 28:11.512
- You see, that is why I love this guy.
- What?

28:11.595 --> 28:15.015
He actually talked to me
when I was just an assistant.

28:15.098 --> 28:17.100
You treated me with respect, Sandy.

28:17.184 --> 28:18.784
- Not many people did.
- Well, of course.

28:18.810 --> 28:20.729
- This is my girl, Mary.
- Hi.

28:20.812 --> 28:22.022
Mary. Sandy Wexler.

28:22.105 --> 28:23.333
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

28:23.357 --> 28:24.797
Are you...
What happened to your arm?

28:25.484 --> 28:29.488
- Yeah, I got myself a tattoo.
- What'd you get?

28:29.571 --> 28:32.616
Uh... it is that of a dog bite.

28:34.118 --> 28:35.994
So how's Carr D'Angelo?

28:36.077 --> 28:39.039
Well, he, uh... he left.
He's working for Blockbuster Video now.

28:39.623 --> 28:43.252
Smart move.
The music business has its ups and downs,

28:43.335 --> 28:46.338
but Blockbuster Video's here
for the long haul.

28:47.005 --> 28:49.090
And you, what are you up to?

28:49.175 --> 28:50.384
I left, too.

28:50.467 --> 28:52.678
- I'm at Capitol Records now.
- Oh.

28:52.761 --> 28:54.138
He's head of A&R.

28:55.264 --> 28:57.474
You know how happy that makes me?

28:57.558 --> 28:59.935
Hiccups Bubatzi goes big time.

29:00.018 --> 29:02.479
That's just...
That's the way it should be.

29:02.563 --> 29:04.731
You worked your ass off, kiddo.

29:04.815 --> 29:07.401
Can I talk business for a second?
Is that all right?

29:07.484 --> 29:09.587
I have a client that, actually,
you would love to meet...

29:09.611 --> 29:10.862
- Tell you what...
- What?

29:10.946 --> 29:14.450
Call my office next week. Yeah.

29:14.533 --> 29:16.743
I mean, you sure? 'Cause I will call.

29:16.827 --> 29:18.870
I know.

29:18.954 --> 29:20.723
- It was great seeing you, pal.
- It was great seeing you.

29:20.747 --> 29:23.167
And I hope, uh,
one of those dresses works out for you.

29:23.250 --> 29:25.336
- Oh, no, this isn't...
- Cute.

29:25.419 --> 29:27.504
- It was... I mean...
- So good.

29:28.088 --> 29:30.674
It's a Bubatzi world. We're all just...

29:30.757 --> 29:32.718
Could you please
not block the whole aisle?

29:33.677 --> 29:35.095
We're all just living in it.

29:35.179 --> 29:36.555
I wasn't blocking the aisle.

29:42.269 --> 29:43.354
Wow.

29:46.064 --> 29:47.941
- Hi.
- Hey, neighbor.

29:48.024 --> 29:49.860
Hi, Cindy!

29:49.943 --> 29:52.112
Where's that
billionaire landlord of yours?

29:52.196 --> 29:54.406
Is he ever going to grace us
with his presence?

29:54.490 --> 29:56.325
What a question.

29:56.408 --> 29:59.077
Listen, he's supposed to come out
for Rosh Hashanah,

29:59.160 --> 30:01.079
but he said last year Purim,
so who knows?

30:01.162 --> 30:03.123
But anyways, how are you?

30:03.207 --> 30:04.500
How is your husband?

30:05.542 --> 30:07.628
Doctors say it could be any day now. Hmm.

30:07.711 --> 30:10.464
Oh, I'm so sorry. It's just...

30:11.047 --> 30:13.509
How are you doing?
No one ever asks how you're doing.

30:13.592 --> 30:14.593
How you feeling?

30:15.176 --> 30:17.095
The truth is that I'm just...

30:17.804 --> 30:19.055
a little bit lonely.

30:19.139 --> 30:22.393
You were together so long.
Of course you're lonely.

30:22.476 --> 30:25.061
So if you ever see
my tennis court lights on at night...

30:26.187 --> 30:28.274
that means that I could use some company.

30:31.777 --> 30:35.364
- It was great to see you, Cindy.
- Bye, Sandy.

30:35.989 --> 30:39.034
Okay, we're gonna go.
All right. Good night, now.

30:39.117 --> 30:40.452
Good night.

30:40.536 --> 30:43.289
Look, Gary Rodgers can't make that jump

30:43.372 --> 30:46.792
unless you clear
every bird from the sky, Tom.

30:49.711 --> 30:53.299
I don't know. Is there a spray for it?
Like, a... a roach spray or...

30:53.382 --> 30:55.175
There's dogs. There's dogs.

30:55.259 --> 30:57.177
A roach spray for birds.

30:58.011 --> 31:01.765
Tom, I'm sorry.
That's not my job. That's your job.

31:01.848 --> 31:03.809
That's why I'm telling you.

31:03.892 --> 31:05.227
I'm telling ya!

31:05.894 --> 31:09.105
Listen, don't do that to me!
I'll pull the plug on this thing!

31:09.189 --> 31:10.774
Do you hear me?

31:12.318 --> 31:15.529
All right. I'm sorry I got hot there,
Tom, but you weren't listening.

31:15.612 --> 31:19.240
Okay, here's a stock tip
for you to make up for that.

31:19.325 --> 31:21.618
Pull all your money out of Apple,

31:21.702 --> 31:23.787
'cause no one's using
the Macintosh anymore.

31:23.870 --> 31:30.251
Put 80% into small local bookstores,
the other 20% into Woolworth's.

31:31.169 --> 31:33.171
Righto.

31:33.297 --> 31:36.675
- Look at you, Mr. Manager Man.
- You don't wanna yell at people,

31:36.758 --> 31:38.844
but sometimes
it's the only way they can hear.

31:38.927 --> 31:40.011
You look stunning.

31:40.095 --> 31:45.351
Well, this yard is the most amazing yard
I've ever seen, and that pool...

31:45.434 --> 31:47.227
The pool's off-limits. House rules.

31:47.311 --> 31:49.688
So, Yuri stopped by my office.

31:49.771 --> 31:52.483
Yeah, I know. He's right there.

31:54.818 --> 31:57.654
You see him? Let's go over.

31:58.614 --> 32:01.408
We need to find the one
that expresses the right message.

32:01.492 --> 32:04.536
You know, "I'm fun.
I'm complicated. I'm sexy."

32:04.620 --> 32:06.830
I'm confused. I'm crazy. I'm embarrassed.

32:06.913 --> 32:09.375
You're beautiful is what you are.
Stop that.

32:09.458 --> 32:11.960
Got a hit on the hip.

32:12.043 --> 32:14.713
This is someone I actually have to call.

32:15.756 --> 32:17.716
Okay, I'll be back in a few seconds.

32:17.799 --> 32:19.468
Okay, cool, we'll be in the pool.

32:20.135 --> 32:21.553
You stay out of the pool.

32:21.637 --> 32:22.804
I was just kidding.

32:23.430 --> 32:25.724
I know, and it was hysterical.

32:25.807 --> 32:27.643
But seriously, stay out of the pool.

32:27.726 --> 32:29.811
No, not you, Barry. Hi!

32:31.563 --> 32:34.024
- I don't know how you do it.
- Do what?

32:34.650 --> 32:36.943
Deal with all the crazy Sandy shit.

32:37.027 --> 32:40.030
- Man, he's such a...
- Boner face?

32:40.113 --> 32:42.616
- I love that.
- He's not a boner face.

32:42.699 --> 32:44.576
- He's a badass.
- Okay.

32:45.411 --> 32:48.497
Well, listen, this girl is one
of the best singers you'll ever see,

32:48.580 --> 32:50.916
and the best, brightest person ever.

32:50.999 --> 32:54.753
I'm gonna go with the one
on the top right corner.

32:55.421 --> 32:58.256
And can you blow up... that one?

32:59.132 --> 33:00.467
Oh, my God.

33:00.551 --> 33:02.052
What? It's a good picture.

33:02.135 --> 33:04.513
Sandy already asked me to do that for him.

33:07.766 --> 33:09.601
I have some interesting news.

33:09.685 --> 33:12.979
Capitol Records wants
to meet with you next week.

33:13.063 --> 33:14.731
They want to hear your demo.

33:16.107 --> 33:17.651

there's a chance you forgot?

34:32.476 --> 34:34.603

- Uh-huh.

34:35.771 --> 34:37.063

Is it in the board?

34:48.784 --> 34:50.034
No.

34:50.118 --> 34:53.539

Let's just go again.

35:05.175 --> 35:09.012
Courtney, there was an issue
on the subwoofer.

35:09.095 --> 35:10.471
It was a bit tinny.

35:10.556 --> 35:13.183
We adjusted that,
and we're ready for you this time.

35:13.266 --> 35:17.062
I'm sorry. On us, not you.
Just one more time.

35:17.145 --> 35:20.481

on the road. Okay?

I didn't know were invented yet.

I'm gonna take a listen.

that I said hi to you.

38:20.078 --> 38:21.496
- Your father, Marty?
- Yeah.

38:21.579 --> 38:24.457
Say hi for me.
He's a good man. A smart man.

38:24.540 --> 38:28.503
Um, he felt bad that you didn't get
into Hillcrest Country Club this year.

Oh, listen, that's not his fault. I was...
That was fine. There's other clubs.

38:33.008 --> 38:35.927
No, actually I think
that his was the deciding vote.

38:36.011 --> 38:39.597
No. It's a capacity thing.
It's not his fault. It's...

38:39.680 --> 38:40.724
Let's do the meeting.

38:40.807 --> 38:43.268
- All right. We're glad you're here.
- Okay. Good.

38:48.689 --> 38:50.191
So, spoke to Barry.

38:50.275 --> 38:52.443
And, uh, Barry wanted us
to listen to your demo,

38:52.527 --> 38:54.654
and I gotta say, some good stuff there.

38:54.738 --> 38:55.739
Thank you.

38:55.822 --> 38:59.325
Just to... I mean, to me, no one's doing
what this kid is doing out there.

38:59.409 --> 39:01.661
It's... it's not Mariah.
It's not Whitney. It's...

39:01.745 --> 39:04.223
Well, listen, if she got the album sales
of Whitney, we'll take it.

39:04.247 --> 39:05.331
Oh. Well, no,

39:05.415 --> 39:08.334
in terms of sound
and commerciability, absolutely.

39:08.418 --> 39:10.754
It's definitely Whitney.
It's a Whitney, 100%.

39:10.837 --> 39:12.439
- Yeah, it has potential.
- Well, hold on now.

39:12.463 --> 39:14.132
The production quality is complete shit.

39:14.215 --> 39:16.509
Complete shit. Terrible.

39:16.592 --> 39:20.221
But the song has potential.
Yeah, no diggity, no doubt.

39:20.305 --> 39:21.389
- Thank you.
- That's it.

39:21.472 --> 39:23.266
The song is all we're worried about.

39:23.349 --> 39:25.685
You gotta lose the corny triangle,
though, man.

39:26.937 --> 39:29.397
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, consider that gone.

39:29.480 --> 39:32.483
Let me ask you something, man.
Whose insane idea was that, anyway?

39:33.318 --> 39:35.528
Whose idea was it? Was it your idea?

39:35.611 --> 39:37.173
No, it was that... It was the engineer's.

39:37.197 --> 39:40.200
I gotta be honest.
It was absolutely ridiculous.

39:40.283 --> 39:44.245
I mean, how big of an asshole
do you have to be to say,

39:44.329 --> 39:46.790
"You know what? Let's put a...

39:46.873 --> 39:49.000
at the end of a ballad"?

39:51.461 --> 39:54.047
So, ready to check out our digs?

39:56.925 --> 39:59.135
This is Studio A.

40:00.136 --> 40:04.057
Les Paul helped engineer it,
and Sinatra made it infamous.

40:04.140 --> 40:07.060
I'm telling you,
this studio is all that...

40:07.143 --> 40:09.687
and a bag of chips.

40:10.313 --> 40:11.314
Yes.

40:13.774 --> 40:15.526
See this star here?

40:15.610 --> 40:18.947
This star marks the spot
with the best acoustics on the...

40:21.116 --> 40:22.450
Sandy?

40:22.533 --> 40:25.411
- How many of these things are there?
- We got a lot.

40:25.495 --> 40:28.039
- Can we talk about this star for a second?
- Yeah, go ahead.

40:28.123 --> 40:30.583
It's got the best acoustics
on the entire planet.

40:30.666 --> 40:32.543
- You good, Sandy?
- Comfortable.

40:33.753 --> 40:35.005
- Could I?
- Right there.

40:53.106 --> 40:55.025
What the hell?
Why the lights out?

40:55.108 --> 40:57.735
Electric bill?
Did you guys pay it this month?

40:57.818 --> 41:00.238
No, he's leaning
on the light switch.

41:00.321 --> 41:01.656
No, I'm not.

41:01.739 --> 41:03.783
- Can you step aside, Sandy?
- Sure.

41:06.036 --> 41:08.788
What? That wasn't me. Wasn't me.

41:08.872 --> 41:10.498
Let's try this again.

41:12.708 --> 41:13.877
From the top.

41:18.589 --> 41:20.633
Sandy, step away
from the light switch.

41:20.716 --> 41:23.594
I did it on purpose that time.
A joke.

41:23.678 --> 41:26.389

you all actually just listened to it.

completes a project,

43:46.029 --> 43:47.947
- we gather together.
- We do?

43:48.031 --> 43:50.991
We didn't even know
you had other clients until today.

43:51.076 --> 43:53.411

43:53.494 --> 43:54.555
I knew you had other clients,

43:54.579 --> 43:56.598
but you told me I was
in a different league from them.

43:56.622 --> 43:59.209
That's what the prick told us, too.

43:59.292 --> 44:01.001
Sorry, we've never done the ritual before.

44:01.086 --> 44:03.588
If it's a first time, Sandy,
how can it be a ritual?

44:03.671 --> 44:05.465
Okay, and who is that guy?

44:05.548 --> 44:08.301
Can we put him in a drawer or something?
That's horrifying.

44:08.384 --> 44:11.137
Sandy, aren't you forgetting
the best part of the ritual?

44:11.221 --> 44:13.723
- What's that, dear?
- Jumping in the pool.

44:13.806 --> 44:15.641
- Yeah! Let's do it!
- Oh, no, no, no, no!

44:15.725 --> 44:17.560
No, that's not part of the ritual!

44:19.019 --> 44:22.482
No, no, no, wait!
We are not permitted in the pool! Okay?

44:22.565 --> 44:25.526
- Firuz forbids it.
- You're not in a cult, are you, Sandy?

44:25.610 --> 44:27.320
No, Firuz is my landlord.

44:27.403 --> 44:30.740
He does not allow us in the pool.
It is forbidden.

44:30.823 --> 44:31.991
No, no. All right!

44:32.075 --> 44:35.453
Ah! Don't you come any closer, Sandy.
I'll put my whole foot in, I swear.

44:35.536 --> 44:36.829
No, no!

44:36.912 --> 44:38.789
- Please don't... No!
- Ooh!

44:38.873 --> 44:41.667
No, I am not kidding you, Courtney.
I will let you go as a client.

44:41.751 --> 44:43.604
- I didn't wanna have to say that.
- Oh, my God.

44:43.628 --> 44:45.921
Do not put your foot in the pool,
or the career is done.

44:46.005 --> 44:47.483
And I'm not... I'm not messing with you.

44:47.507 --> 44:49.267
- Oh, God.
- I don't care what you're saying.

44:49.342 --> 44:50.968
Whoa!

44:51.051 --> 44:53.095
Okay, you did it! You did it!
You did the foot.

44:53.179 --> 44:54.722
You did the foot. The foot is wet.

44:54.805 --> 44:58.351
Please come back in the house.
I'm asking nicely.

44:58.434 --> 45:00.520
I just don't have... I can't...

45:00.603 --> 45:02.563
I wasn't gonna go in.

45:02.647 --> 45:04.690
I know you weren't gonna go in.

45:04.774 --> 45:06.817
I... I can't joke, too?

45:06.901 --> 45:08.944
- Really? "I know you won't."
- I can't joke, too.

45:09.028 --> 45:11.364
Whoo! Cannonball!

45:11.447 --> 45:12.573
Whoo!

45:32.885 --> 45:35.263
Maybe tomorrow. Maybe tomorrow, okay?

45:35.346 --> 45:36.556
Maybe I'll wear you tomorrow.

45:36.639 --> 45:38.559
And... and it's not you guys.
You're doing great.

45:38.599 --> 45:40.685
I love you guys.
I love you guys, all right?

45:40.768 --> 45:42.603
Good night. Good night, everybody.

45:42.687 --> 45:43.854
Good night.

You find someone ♪

45:50.570 --> 45:55.366

- Sandy?
- Who's that?

46:00.663 --> 46:02.332
Don't "who's that" me, man.

46:02.415 --> 46:04.124
Why do you screw Firuz?

46:04.209 --> 46:06.502
- Firuz?
- Yes.

46:06.586 --> 46:09.297
I don't see you. Show your face!

46:09.380 --> 46:11.549
I'm in Tehran, you imbecile.

46:11.632 --> 46:14.260
I tell you to stay out of my pool,
and what do you do?

46:14.344 --> 46:16.011
You go in my pool.

46:16.095 --> 46:19.557
Uh, nobody went in your pool.
No, no, who told you that? The dogs?

46:19.640 --> 46:23.561
I have cameras everywhere, man.
I'm watching you all the time.

46:23.644 --> 46:26.356
You're much better
than anything we have on Iranian TV.

46:26.439 --> 46:28.399
I see you with bacon over the sink,

46:28.483 --> 46:31.361
I see you fall asleep in my chair,
watching my Cinemax.

46:31.444 --> 46:33.279
And I see your godless friends in my pool!

46:33.363 --> 46:35.865
No, no, listen, Firuz.
Here's what happened.

46:35.948 --> 46:38.368
There was an earthquake in Los Angeles.

46:38.451 --> 46:42.247
So we just went in the pool
'cause it's the safest place to be.

46:42.330 --> 46:45.500
But we didn't go all the way in.
No water was touched.

46:45.583 --> 46:48.461
Sandy, you lie all the time, man.
It's embarrassing.

46:48.544 --> 46:51.005
I wish I was lying. I wish I was.

46:51.088 --> 46:53.888
And how many times are you going to
listen to that one song, my friend?

46:53.924 --> 46:56.218
I mean, mix in a little
Miami Sound Machine or something.

46:56.302 --> 46:58.137
It's a client of mine. Courtney Clarke.

46:58.220 --> 46:59.430
What, you don't like it?

46:59.514 --> 47:01.932
The song is good, and I like her, too.

47:02.016 --> 47:04.894
You know, when she was in bathroom,
I got quite a good look at her.

47:04.977 --> 47:06.771
- You what?
- Firuz joking.

47:06.854 --> 47:09.274
I don't have cameras
in bathroom anymore.

47:09.357 --> 47:11.335
I had them taken out
when you had the big hemorrhoid.

47:11.359 --> 47:14.111
That wasn't a hemorrhoid,
that was a fissure.

47:14.194 --> 47:17.782
But, Sandy, people in my pool,
this I do not like!

47:17.865 --> 47:19.575
- I...
- That's strike one, Sandy!

47:19.659 --> 47:20.743
I'm telling you...

47:20.826 --> 47:23.746
- You don't want to get strike two.
- I... I agree.

47:23.829 --> 47:25.873
Goodbye from Firuz.

47:26.499 --> 47:27.667
Bye-bye.

47:31.712 --> 47:35.925
You know, I did tell them not to go
in the pool, and they did it anyway.

47:36.008 --> 47:37.885
- So you admit it?
- No! I...

47:37.968 --> 47:41.055
Strike two! Firuz knows everything.

47:45.017 --> 47:47.770
Okay,
what are we doing today, big guy?

47:47.853 --> 47:50.940
We going to Jerry's?
Or you want to go to Carney's?

47:51.023 --> 47:52.358
I can go either one.

47:52.442 --> 47:56.028
It's all good for the Atkins.
I can get a frankfurter, no bun.

47:56.111 --> 47:58.238
- I know.
- I can get a plate of roast beef...

47:58.323 --> 48:00.008
- or corn beef...
- Don't go over the whole menu.

48:00.032 --> 48:01.552
I don't give a shit about your roast beef.

48:01.576 --> 48:04.119
Stu Smiley passed on me
for the Young Comedians Special.

48:04.203 --> 48:05.764
- That's right. He...
- I don't even believe it.

48:05.788 --> 48:07.164
- He's a moron.
- He's not a moron.

48:07.247 --> 48:12.670
He's a pompous know-it-all,
smarmy little Ivy League pussy.

48:12.753 --> 48:17.717
- He went to San Diego State... actually.
- You're kidding me right now, right?

48:17.800 --> 48:19.653
You corrected me
'cause he went to San Diego State?

48:19.677 --> 48:21.136
No, I'm agreeing with you.

48:21.220 --> 48:26.684
I'm saying you are too smart
and too topical to be on HBO.

48:26.767 --> 48:27.977
They like young and stupid.

48:28.060 --> 48:29.979
- They like cute and moronic.
- Yes.

48:30.062 --> 48:32.815
- Nothing challenging, nothing unfamiliar.
- No.

48:32.898 --> 48:35.776
- They want some, like, ex-Florida DJ...
- Ha!

48:35.860 --> 48:37.362
Who's blandly handsome,

48:37.445 --> 48:41.741
and his little gimmicks, his voice cracks
on the punch line or he's...

48:41.824 --> 48:43.624
Pretends to be tripping
on acid the whole set.

48:44.744 --> 48:46.078
Chinese food?

48:47.079 --> 48:48.539
I don't want Chinese food for lunch.

48:49.457 --> 48:50.958
All right, beef and broccoli.

48:51.041 --> 48:53.628
This conversation goes a lot better
when it's just me talking.

48:53.711 --> 48:56.464
- I'm not in the conversation?
- Oh, you are, but you aren't.

48:56.547 --> 49:00.385
You can let... Blast off on me. Go ahead.
Yell at me as much as you want.

49:00.468 --> 49:03.471
As long as you promise to bring it
on the stage with you tonight,

49:03.554 --> 49:04.972
- and you show HBO...
- I promise.

49:05.055 --> 49:06.641
They don't need to discover you.

49:06.724 --> 49:09.852
Kevin Connors will discover himself.
Thank you very much.

49:09.935 --> 49:13.355
What does that even mean?
How do I discover myself?

49:13.439 --> 49:15.483
Do you know how dumb that sounds?

49:15.566 --> 49:18.694
That's one of the... Don't click.
Why're you clicking? Stop clicking!

49:18.778 --> 49:21.280
You always click whenever
you get nervous. It's psychotic.

49:21.363 --> 49:22.782
Your technique...

49:22.865 --> 49:23.991
What is that?

49:24.074 --> 49:26.368
It's, uh... That's Courtney's song.

49:26.452 --> 49:28.621
That's... Ask her what station it is.

49:28.704 --> 49:30.498
What station is it?

49:30.581 --> 49:33.042
Excuse me, miss? Oh, wow. Hi.

49:33.125 --> 49:35.127
Oh, my God, I know you.

49:35.210 --> 49:36.295
- She knows me.
- Hey. Yeah.

49:36.378 --> 49:39.048
Didn't you get one star
on Star Search the other day?

49:39.131 --> 49:40.758
No.

49:40.841 --> 49:43.010
This... What station are you listening to?
The number?

49:43.093 --> 49:45.220
- What?
- The station you're listening to?

49:45.304 --> 49:47.741
You need to enunciate.
I can't understand what you are saying.

49:47.765 --> 49:49.600
No, no, what is the dial number?

49:49.684 --> 49:51.393
What are you tripping about, bro?

49:51.477 --> 49:54.522
I'm asking you
what station you're listening to!

49:54.605 --> 49:56.482
Don't you... What are you...

49:56.566 --> 49:58.108
Good job. You scared her off.

49:58.192 --> 50:00.194
Oh, come on here.

50:00.277 --> 50:01.654
It's your Uncle Joe Benson...

50:04.073 --> 50:06.283
There it is. There it is!

50:07.452 --> 50:09.286
This is Courtney's song.

50:10.245 --> 50:11.973
What are you shocked by?
She's a great singer.

50:11.997 --> 50:13.040
Oh, my God.

50:13.123 --> 50:15.918
♪ And we were in a tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G ♪

50:17.920 --> 50:19.171
What the hell, Sandy?

50:20.715 --> 50:22.508
You can take care of this, right?

50:22.592 --> 50:24.912
My Nautilus place is right here.
I'm gonna go do a circuit.

50:25.970 --> 50:28.055
How about this song? Huh, guys?

50:30.057 --> 50:34.144
I got Integrity No-Fault Insurance.
How about you?

50:38.398 --> 50:39.525
The song... This song...

50:40.275 --> 50:41.276
Ha...

51:10.264 --> 51:11.390
Hey, hey.

51:22.359 --> 51:24.319
You look like a star.

51:24.904 --> 51:26.238
Thank you!

51:26.321 --> 51:28.866
You look like Mike Tyson knocked you out.

51:28.949 --> 51:30.242
What happened?

51:30.325 --> 51:33.370
Oh, I ran into a moose on Melrose.

51:33.453 --> 51:37.082
Yeah, it must have escaped
off the Paramount lot.

51:37.708 --> 51:41.796
- This dress on you...
- I just love it.

51:41.879 --> 51:45.716
Of course you do. It's from
your dirty magazine page, ya weirdo.

51:49.053 --> 51:50.387
Well, it works!

51:50.470 --> 51:53.599
What are we doing tonight to celebrate?
You were on the radio!

51:53.683 --> 51:55.768
Hmm. Well, Bling just called,

51:55.851 --> 51:59.980
and Quincy Jones invited me
to his party tonight.

52:00.064 --> 52:03.818
- Jonesy? Jonesy's having a party?
- Okay. Uh-huh.

52:03.901 --> 52:05.235
I heard he was gonna have a...

52:05.319 --> 52:06.821
- I just didn't know when.
- Oh.

52:06.904 --> 52:08.906
So what?
Did you get a plus-one or...

52:08.989 --> 52:10.407
Yes, plus-one.

52:11.158 --> 52:13.035
- And I'm the one?
- Yeah.

52:13.118 --> 52:17.081
You know, I met his grandmother
years ago at a Hamburger Hamlet.

52:17.164 --> 52:19.333
She calls him Quincelius.

52:19.416 --> 52:22.044
So every time I see him,
I say, "Hi, Quincelius."

52:22.127 --> 52:23.879
He gives me a look like,
"How did he know?"

52:23.963 --> 52:27.299
Okay, cool.
So should we go to the party?

52:27.382 --> 52:29.885
You wanna go to it?
Why shouldn't... Let's pop by.

52:29.969 --> 52:31.303
He lives in Venice, right?

52:31.386 --> 52:33.513
Uh... no, the address is in Bel Air.

52:33.598 --> 52:36.767
Oh, so he moved? Okay, okay, he moved.

52:50.447 --> 52:52.742
Sandy Wexler. Wow.

52:52.825 --> 52:54.368
They let you in this party?

52:54.451 --> 52:55.703
Hey, Bronstein.

52:55.786 --> 52:57.806
You heard you didn't get into
Hillcrest Country Club, right?

52:57.830 --> 52:58.914
Yeah, I heard.

52:58.998 --> 53:01.709
This place is incredible!

53:01.792 --> 53:03.919
Yeah, it's nice. It's nice.

53:04.003 --> 53:06.338
His one in Venice wasn't trying as hard.

53:07.214 --> 53:09.610
Quincy never lived in Venice.
What you talking about, Willis?

53:09.634 --> 53:11.260
What? No, she said he did.

53:11.343 --> 53:14.221
- What?
- She? Oh!

53:14.304 --> 53:15.890
I'm a huge fan. I'm Arsenio.

53:16.556 --> 53:19.476
I know, Arsenio. Courtney.

53:19.559 --> 53:24.189
Hey, Arsenio. Good to see you.
I'm Sandy Wexler, her manager.

53:24.273 --> 53:27.359
You remember? We met at, uh...
at Bernie's beach house.

53:27.442 --> 53:30.237
Your manager look like he fell down
an elevator shaft. What's up?

53:30.320 --> 53:34.241
No, no, no. I, uh... Fender bender.
You should see the other guy.

53:34.324 --> 53:36.493
- Oh, he got hurt?
- Who did?

53:36.576 --> 53:38.954
- The other guy?
- What? No.

53:40.665 --> 53:43.083
You know what?
I heard your new song, "Mr. DJ."

53:43.167 --> 53:45.603
I love it. It's off the chain.
You've gotta come on the show and do it.

53:45.627 --> 53:47.379
- I would love to.
- Oh, well, listen.

53:47.462 --> 53:49.924
I got a call from Johnny Carson
today, actually.

53:50.007 --> 53:54.594
He heard the song as well on the radio,
and he booked her on the show next week.

53:54.679 --> 53:55.930
Carson?

53:57.097 --> 53:58.307
Well, congratulations.

53:58.390 --> 54:02.019
You ever need me, Stage 29.
I'll be there forever, baby.

54:02.102 --> 54:05.522
Ah, thanks, Arsenio.
No, I didn't mean any problem...

54:05.605 --> 54:08.275
You didn't tell me
I was doing Carson next week!

54:08.358 --> 54:11.987
That was a negotiation ploy.
I may have overplayed my hand there.

54:12.071 --> 54:13.655
Carson retired two years ago.

54:13.739 --> 54:15.950
Sandy Wexler?
Somebody hide the pastrami.

54:17.284 --> 54:19.119
Hey, thank you. Good to see you, too.

54:20.746 --> 54:24.124
Wow. Look at all these awards he has.

54:24.208 --> 54:25.584
You'll have more one day.

54:25.667 --> 54:27.669
- Me?
- Yes, you.

54:27.753 --> 54:28.879
You promise me this.

54:28.963 --> 54:31.423
- After you win your first Grammy...
- Uh-huh.

54:31.506 --> 54:35.385
You go home that night,
you put your ugly duckling hat on...

54:35.469 --> 54:36.629
I am not putting that hat on.

54:36.678 --> 54:38.323
To remind yourself where you come from.

54:38.347 --> 54:41.558
- You put it on. I'm not putting it on.
- You don't wanna see me in that...

54:41.641 --> 54:43.769
Sandy, Sandy, Sandy.

54:44.353 --> 54:46.313
Well, who whooped your ass
and got away with it?

54:46.396 --> 54:51.401
No, this was a high-impact
Tae Bo class I took. It's fine.

54:51.485 --> 54:52.486
Okay.

54:52.569 --> 54:55.614
How about our girl here
getting the radio play, huh?

54:55.697 --> 54:57.657
Did I tell you she's a superstar or what?

54:57.742 --> 54:59.368
Oh, yeah, she's getting some heat.

54:59.451 --> 55:01.703
- Yeah, we'll see where it goes.
- Thanks, Bling.

55:01.787 --> 55:06.333
Excuse me. Excuse me, Shortie Doo-Wop,
can I get two Zimas and for Sandy...

55:06.416 --> 55:08.335
I'll take a diet ginger ale.

55:08.418 --> 55:11.463
- Amy Baskin.
- Sandy, what are you doing here?

55:11.546 --> 55:14.759
I was invited.
Thank you very much. Hi.

55:15.467 --> 55:17.636
Bling, I want you to meet Amy Baskin.

55:17.719 --> 55:20.472
To me, she is the next Grace Kelly.

55:20.555 --> 55:23.142
- I'm trying.
- Amy? Courtney.

55:23.225 --> 55:24.702
Remember me from the ritual pool party?

55:24.726 --> 55:27.772
Oh, my God. I heard your song
on the radio twice today.

55:27.855 --> 55:30.900
- Congratulations, Courtney.
- Oh, well, we got a great manager.

55:30.983 --> 55:33.485
He told me to always sing from the heart.

55:33.568 --> 55:36.071
And I tell this girl,
"Always act from the heart."

55:36.155 --> 55:38.842
Hey, did we get the offer on
the Mentos commercial I was on hold for?

55:38.866 --> 55:42.619
No, you weren't on hold for it.
What I said was,

55:42.702 --> 55:46.498
"I called them and they put me on hold
for about 45 minutes."

55:46.581 --> 55:50.085
But when they... they got on the phone,
they told me they passed on you.

55:51.253 --> 55:52.838
- Well, there you go.
- No, it's good.

55:52.922 --> 55:54.423
They said she had a great reading.

55:54.506 --> 55:56.926
That it truly looked like
she loved the Mentos.

55:57.759 --> 55:59.011
I'll be back with your drinks.

55:59.094 --> 56:00.095
- Okay.
- Okay.

56:00.179 --> 56:03.473
Yo, check it out. It's OJ Simpson,
Phil Spector and Robert Blake.

56:03.557 --> 56:06.393
Good guys.
Call 'em the dream team.

56:06.476 --> 56:08.121
- I'm gonna go chop it up with 'em.
- All right.

56:08.145 --> 56:11.023
The juice is on the loose!
What's happening, killer?

56:11.606 --> 56:15.152
So, uh, what do you think?
We've been to the party. We had fun.

56:15.235 --> 56:17.779
- Time to go?
- I wanna see Jonesy.

56:17.863 --> 56:20.199
- Who's Jonesy?
- Quincy?

56:20.282 --> 56:22.827
- Oh, Quincy? You wanna see, uh...
- Yeah.

56:22.910 --> 56:24.286
Quincelius?

56:24.369 --> 56:25.787
All right. Let's get that done.

56:25.871 --> 56:28.391
- You think he's around?
- Yeah, it'll be good to see him again.

56:28.999 --> 56:30.334
Uh, yeah, let's find him.

56:31.043 --> 56:35.881
Okay, now, Courtney,
it's Domaines Ott Bandol Rosé.

56:35.965 --> 56:37.216
- My favorite.
- Mmm.

56:43.889 --> 56:45.224
What do you think?

56:45.307 --> 56:48.102
Mmm! This is so good, Mr. Jones.

56:48.185 --> 56:49.937
What do you think, Sandy?
You like it?

56:51.480 --> 56:52.898
What's the matter, man?

56:52.982 --> 56:55.025
Nothing. No, I think it's good.

56:55.109 --> 56:57.402
It's... it's... It's just grapey.

56:58.237 --> 57:02.616
- What do you mean "grapey"?
- Oh, I... I didn't say it was a bad thing.

57:03.617 --> 57:06.078
Okay. I'm gonna try
to respect your opinion, brother.

57:06.661 --> 57:10.415
Let me try another one.
I've got a '61 Château Pétrus downstairs.

57:10.499 --> 57:11.625
Okay.

57:11.708 --> 57:14.419
I paid eight grand for it
at the Côte de Nuits.

57:14.503 --> 57:16.296
- Yeah, okay.
- That's too much. No.

57:16.380 --> 57:18.590
Pretty sure this'll get your attention.

57:18.673 --> 57:20.300
Thank you, Quincelius.

57:20.384 --> 57:21.801
Who the hell is Quincelius?

57:22.719 --> 57:25.055
Nobody. Come on. What are we doing here?

57:27.975 --> 57:29.559
Thank you.

57:29.643 --> 57:31.854
It was grapey. It was a little grapey.

57:31.937 --> 57:35.524
- I think you offended him.
- No, I didn't.

57:35.607 --> 57:37.151
I thought it was cool.

57:38.193 --> 57:42.156
When he comes back,
I dare you to say you hate that one, too.

57:42.239 --> 57:43.407
What?

57:43.490 --> 57:46.743
The man spent $8,000 on the wine.
He'll kill me.

57:46.826 --> 57:49.538
Oh, we'll laugh our asses off. Come on.

57:49.621 --> 57:54.293
- Courtney, what do you got me doing here?
- I was saving this for a special occasion.

57:54.376 --> 57:56.170
I think this is special enough.

57:58.338 --> 58:00.632
You'll have to let me know
what you think, baby.

58:00.715 --> 58:02.467
Yeah. Thank you.

58:03.718 --> 58:04.844
Very much.

58:06.305 --> 58:07.932
What do you think, honey?

58:08.015 --> 58:11.226
Mr. Jones, this is exquisite.

58:11.310 --> 58:12.937
And, Sanford, you likey?

58:18.233 --> 58:20.819
- Honestly?
- What else, man?

58:22.362 --> 58:24.990
- It's a little nutty.
- Nutty?

58:26.241 --> 58:27.742
For my taste.

58:32.414 --> 58:34.917
Maybe if you put an ice cube in it...

58:35.000 --> 58:39.713
- Oh, my goodness.
- Get out of my house!

58:39.796 --> 58:41.276
- Now!
- Hey, hey, I didn't mean to...

58:43.300 --> 58:45.302
- Now! Out! Out!
- I'm gonna leave.

58:45.385 --> 58:47.972
- No, I just got to get my jacket.
- Out! Get... get out of here.

58:48.055 --> 58:49.681
- Listen.
- Out!

58:49.764 --> 58:53.102
Man, one of these is mine.
Is this navy or black?

58:53.185 --> 58:57.022
I'm having a hard time seeing.
My glasses are blurry from the wine toss.

58:57.106 --> 58:58.273
Get out!

58:58.357 --> 59:00.943
You know what? This is probably it.
I... I'm gonna go.

59:01.026 --> 59:03.737
- Leave!
- Courtney! Okay.

59:03.820 --> 59:06.949
Hey. Thank you, Q-bert.
It was a great night.

59:07.032 --> 59:10.035
- Did you see the way that was...
- You made me do that! You!

59:10.119 --> 59:11.471
- How are we getting out?
- Are you happy?

59:11.495 --> 59:13.830
I don't know where...
Go. Just go. Is he coming?

59:13.913 --> 59:17.792
Courtney's first single was huge.
I remember the album was even bigger.

59:17.876 --> 59:20.837
I heard every song
on every station of every radio.

59:25.550 --> 59:27.177
Yay, Courtney!

59:29.429 --> 59:32.016
Courtney blew up
to Whitney Houston-type status.

59:32.099 --> 59:33.100
Oh, really?

59:33.183 --> 59:34.983
- So it was crazy.
- Mariah Carey, you know...

59:39.231 --> 59:43.152
You're nobody, and then you're somebody,
and everyone's clamoring after you.

59:43.235 --> 59:45.737
And it's scary. It can be scary.

59:59.001 --> 01:00:01.420
- Sandy...
- Courtney, what's wrong?

01:00:01.503 --> 01:00:03.713
I think someone's outside my house.

01:00:03.797 --> 01:00:06.401
I'm scared it's one of those freaks
that's been calling me or something.

01:00:06.425 --> 01:00:08.510
What? Who's calling you?

01:00:08.593 --> 01:00:09.803
I don't know.

01:00:09.886 --> 01:00:12.681
I've been dealing with this
ever since I moved into this place.

01:00:12.764 --> 01:00:14.891
- Are your doors locked?
- Yeah.

01:00:14.974 --> 01:00:17.144
You stay inside. I'll be right there.

01:00:27.779 --> 01:00:29.489
You're in trouble now, tough guy!

01:00:30.324 --> 01:00:33.327
Look what I've been carrying
around in my backseat...

01:00:33.993 --> 01:00:37.039
ever since I was attacked
on Ventura Place.

01:00:37.956 --> 01:00:40.334
Huh? You like this?

01:00:41.043 --> 01:00:42.836
You wanna... You wanna feel it?

01:00:44.504 --> 01:00:46.048
Come out! Where are you?

01:00:47.216 --> 01:00:49.926
Courtney, stay in the house!

01:00:53.263 --> 01:00:54.431
What's that?

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:58.185
What? You think you can hide?

01:01:00.854 --> 01:01:04.441
Are you scared? Huh?

01:01:04.524 --> 01:01:06.860
'Cause I'm scared, too.

01:01:06.943 --> 01:01:10.280
I'm scared I'm gonna shatter
every bone in your face!

01:01:17.246 --> 01:01:18.497
You're gone?

01:01:20.374 --> 01:01:23.085
That's it. Truce.

01:01:24.294 --> 01:01:25.295
No more.

01:01:30.717 --> 01:01:32.094
Ow!

01:01:36.515 --> 01:01:41.645
What you were so afraid of
was nothing but a raccoon.

01:01:41.728 --> 01:01:42.729
No way.

01:01:42.812 --> 01:01:46.108
I'm telling you, you'll never have to
worry about him again, though.

01:01:46.816 --> 01:01:48.527
You didn't kill him, did you?

01:01:49.403 --> 01:01:51.696
No. No. Uh, I...

01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:56.034
I seen him go out into the forest again
to see his family, so...

01:01:56.118 --> 01:01:57.786
All right? But I screamed at him.

01:01:57.869 --> 01:02:01.206
I let him know, "Don't come back here.
You stay with the..."

01:02:02.374 --> 01:02:04.251
On your side of the fence."

01:02:04.334 --> 01:02:06.170
Okay.

01:02:06.253 --> 01:02:08.172
Come on in.
Let me wash those clothes.

01:02:08.255 --> 01:02:12.301
When I used to represent Hooch
from Turner & Hooch,

01:02:12.384 --> 01:02:16.638
I got a similar call
about a late-night trespasser.

01:02:16.721 --> 01:02:19.349
Turned out it was Benji's trainer.

01:02:19.433 --> 01:02:24.479
Uh, he was jealous that Hooch
was now the hottest dog in the business.

01:02:24.563 --> 01:02:27.607
- You're making that up.
- No, no, no, I think that's true.

01:02:27.691 --> 01:02:30.860
You're insane, Sandy.
Take off those pants.

01:02:31.611 --> 01:02:34.198
What? What, right here?

01:02:34.281 --> 01:02:35.324
I won't look.

01:02:35.407 --> 01:02:37.492
Well, you'll be missing out, then.

01:02:37.576 --> 01:02:39.244
Oh, really?

01:02:39.911 --> 01:02:42.121
No. Maybe you should turn around.

01:02:42.206 --> 01:02:44.666
Turning around.

01:02:44.749 --> 01:02:47.752
I'm glad you took this place, by the way.

01:02:47.836 --> 01:02:49.588
The real estate lady told me

01:02:49.671 --> 01:02:53.467
that David Crosby died
three times in this house.

01:02:53.550 --> 01:02:55.802
I'm gonna keep the beeper,
if that's all right.

01:02:55.885 --> 01:02:58.638
Kevin Connors did a show on Brea tonight,

01:02:58.722 --> 01:03:02.767
co-headlining with AJ Jamal.
I wanna make sure that went well.

01:03:03.727 --> 01:03:06.104
So, pants are coming down.

01:03:07.021 --> 01:03:08.273
Here you go.

01:03:10.692 --> 01:03:13.237
All right. Come on.
Let's get these washed.

01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:15.905
Sure. Hey, thanks for doing that.

01:03:19.784 --> 01:03:21.370
You called Bling, too?

01:03:21.453 --> 01:03:23.413
Oh, I was here anyway, Sandy.

01:03:23.497 --> 01:03:25.374
With my pants on.

01:03:30.044 --> 01:03:32.964
The important thing
is that Courtney feels safe.

01:03:33.047 --> 01:03:34.966
- That's all I'm worried about.
- Hmm.

01:03:35.049 --> 01:03:36.718
An unlisted phone number.

01:03:36.801 --> 01:03:38.696
That's the way to go
for an artist of your stature.

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:40.680
I can get that done for you
tomorrow morning.

01:03:40.764 --> 01:03:43.975
Oh, no, it's all... It's all good, Sandy.
I handled it already.

01:03:44.058 --> 01:03:47.145
Oh, you did? Good. Good. Good for you.

01:03:50.064 --> 01:03:52.025
Sandy, can you pass me the gravy?

01:03:52.108 --> 01:03:55.612
Can I pass you the gravy?
Absolutely. I can pass you the gravy.

01:03:55.695 --> 01:03:57.507
- Here. You want me to put it on for you?
- I got it.

01:03:57.531 --> 01:03:58.823
- You got it?
- Yeah.

01:03:58.907 --> 01:04:01.660
I was thinking we should get back
in the studio, Courtney.

01:04:01.743 --> 01:04:04.162
Maybe noodle around with some new tunes.

01:04:04.246 --> 01:04:06.873
With all due respect, Sandy,
I understand that,

01:04:06.956 --> 01:04:10.168
but, uh, her existing record's
gonna be on the charts for months.

01:04:10.252 --> 01:04:12.504
You don't want her competing
against herself now, do you?

01:04:12.587 --> 01:04:16.633
Who else do you want her competing with?
I mean it's a win-win. To me.

01:04:19.218 --> 01:04:20.470
I know what you mean, Sandy.

01:04:20.554 --> 01:04:23.765
I have lots of ideas,
but I can't tomorrow.

01:04:23.848 --> 01:04:25.975
We've got publicist meetings.

01:04:26.059 --> 01:04:29.271
- Publicists? What... what publicists?
- Oh, yeah, just the top ones.

01:04:29.354 --> 01:04:30.998
You know what?
I'll send you the list, actually.

01:04:31.022 --> 01:04:33.608
You know what?
Better yet, I'll e-mail you the list.

01:04:33.692 --> 01:04:36.445
- What is that?
- Oh, you're not familiar with e-mail?

01:04:36.528 --> 01:04:40.282
E-mail? Of course I heard of that.
Which one are you talking about?

01:04:40.365 --> 01:04:44.536
You got your computer, right?
And you plug that into your phone line...

01:04:44.619 --> 01:04:50.334
and you could send a document to
another computer clear across the country

01:04:50.417 --> 01:04:52.502
in a matter of minutes.

01:04:52.586 --> 01:04:56.298
Who licks the envelope? R2-D2?
I'm lost right now.

01:04:56.381 --> 01:04:59.050
Now I think we're making
a wrong move here.

01:04:59.133 --> 01:05:03.221
I have a publicity campaign designed
strictly for this woman right here.

01:05:03.305 --> 01:05:06.433
You have a publicity campaign? Well,
I mean, we're... The family's all here.

01:05:06.516 --> 01:05:08.267
We would love to hear about it.
What is it?

01:05:08.352 --> 01:05:10.770
Well, I usually like my clients
to start slow.

01:05:10.854 --> 01:05:12.897
Keep it simple. Don't overexpose.

01:05:14.232 --> 01:05:16.150
- Really, Sandy?
- Yes.

01:05:16.234 --> 01:05:18.434
Just gonna spit your chicken on my face?
That's for you.

01:05:19.237 --> 01:05:22.407
Okay. Maybe we'll hold off
on the publicist thing.

01:05:22.491 --> 01:05:23.492
Thank you.

01:05:23.575 --> 01:05:25.243
But then we'll bring in one soon.

01:05:25.327 --> 01:05:26.953
- Okay, boys?
- We'll talk about that.

01:05:27.036 --> 01:05:29.122
Absolutely. I think that's smart.

01:05:29.205 --> 01:05:31.207
All right. I'm gonna go check
on these jeans.

01:05:31.290 --> 01:05:33.209
- Okay?
- Yes, my queen.

01:05:33.292 --> 01:05:34.628
Your queen?

01:05:36.588 --> 01:05:41.050
Sandy, you are the reason
she needs a publicist.

01:05:41.134 --> 01:05:42.511
I'm the reason?

01:05:42.594 --> 01:05:45.448
You know how many calls I got after
Quincy Jones threw you out of his party?

01:05:45.472 --> 01:05:49.351
- Oh... She dared me to do it.
- What are you, 14, Sandy?

01:05:49.434 --> 01:05:51.811
No, I'm not 14. I'm not 14 at all.

01:05:51.895 --> 01:05:53.312
Your job is to protect her.

01:05:53.397 --> 01:05:55.399
I protect her 24/7!

01:05:55.482 --> 01:05:58.067
And how is that?
By screwing up her shot on Arsenio?

01:05:58.151 --> 01:05:59.694
We got the show, didn't we?

01:05:59.778 --> 01:06:01.195
Because I fixed it!

01:06:01.279 --> 01:06:04.323
You fixed it. You did everything.
You invented music.

01:06:04.408 --> 01:06:05.659
What did you do, Sandy?

01:06:05.742 --> 01:06:08.303
Did you file the paperwork for the Grammy
nomination before the deadline?

01:06:08.327 --> 01:06:10.414
Did you squash the story in the Enquirer

01:06:10.497 --> 01:06:13.833
about her corrections officer father
falling asleep during a prison riot?

01:06:13.917 --> 01:06:15.960
Did you send envelopes of cash
to the radio stations

01:06:16.044 --> 01:06:17.336
so they could play her record?

01:06:18.337 --> 01:06:19.839
No, you didn't do that.

01:06:19.923 --> 01:06:21.442
You know how I know
you didn't do it, Sandy?

01:06:21.466 --> 01:06:23.342
Because I did it. I did all those things.

01:06:23.427 --> 01:06:26.012
And what did you do? Hmm?

01:06:26.095 --> 01:06:30.016
You made sure Gary,
the daredevil trapeze artist,

01:06:30.099 --> 01:06:32.936
was her opening act
at the Universal Amphitheatre.

01:06:33.937 --> 01:06:34.938
Gary is family.

01:06:35.021 --> 01:06:37.691
This dude shattered his pelvis
on an amplifier!

01:06:37.774 --> 01:06:39.401
I was there. I saw.

01:06:39.484 --> 01:06:41.360
There was blood
all over the first three rows!

01:06:41.445 --> 01:06:43.405
- People were vomiting!
- Yeah, all right.

01:06:43.488 --> 01:06:44.698
That doesn't really segue well

01:06:44.781 --> 01:06:47.451
into soulful singer-songwriter now,
does it, Sandy?

01:06:47.534 --> 01:06:49.911
She got 'em back.
She's too good to lose a crowd.

01:06:49.994 --> 01:06:51.413
She's too good for you.

01:06:52.288 --> 01:06:54.008
Sandy, she could have
any manager she wants.

01:06:54.082 --> 01:06:55.166
She wants me!

01:06:55.249 --> 01:06:57.419
And that is what's holding her back.

01:06:59.170 --> 01:07:00.880
Look, Sandy, you did your job.

01:07:01.756 --> 01:07:04.426
You brought her up to the big leagues.

01:07:04.509 --> 01:07:06.970
I'm telling you. Come on!

01:07:07.887 --> 01:07:10.724
But now you're just...
You're out of your depth.

01:07:10.807 --> 01:07:13.184
Don't let your ego get in the way.

01:07:13.893 --> 01:07:17.981
Can you look me in the eye and tell me
you're doing what's best for her?

01:07:22.401 --> 01:07:23.653
- Okay.
- Ah!

01:07:23.737 --> 01:07:26.155
Pants-Off Dance-Off
is officially canceled.

01:07:26.239 --> 01:07:27.616
- Put these bad boys on.
- Okay.

01:07:27.699 --> 01:07:31.703
You got the stain out?
Very nice. Look at you. Look at you.

01:07:31.786 --> 01:07:35.164
Well, I'm beat to shit.
I'm gonna call it.

01:07:35.749 --> 01:07:39.002
You're gonna call it?
All right. I'll walk you out, then.

01:07:39.085 --> 01:07:42.589
Thank you for everything.
Appreciate it all.

01:07:52.015 --> 01:07:54.893
Oh. Oh, yeah. Good night.

01:08:06.530 --> 01:08:08.364
Thanks for scaring the stalker raccoon.

01:08:08.447 --> 01:08:11.660
You don't have to thank me, Courtney.
That's my pleasure.

01:08:11.743 --> 01:08:12.744
Look, Sandy...

01:08:14.453 --> 01:08:16.247
This rock star thing is new to me.

01:08:17.122 --> 01:08:19.457
I'm doing the best I can
to make everybody happy, you know.

01:08:19.542 --> 01:08:23.796
You make the world happy, Courtney.
That's all you need to worry about.

01:08:24.714 --> 01:08:25.799
Thank you, Sandy.

01:08:26.508 --> 01:08:29.301
That's why it's difficult
for me to tell you this.

01:08:29.385 --> 01:08:33.014
But where you are right now
in your career,

01:08:33.096 --> 01:08:36.768
and what it requires of my time, it's...

01:08:38.937 --> 01:08:43.608
I'm being kind of forced here
to make sacrifices that,

01:08:43.692 --> 01:08:46.944
with good conscience,
I don't really wanna make.

01:08:47.028 --> 01:08:48.487
Like what?

01:08:48.572 --> 01:08:52.576
Like my stable of talent.

01:08:52.658 --> 01:08:57.162
I can't give them what I believe
each and every one of them deserves

01:08:57.246 --> 01:09:02.794
if I'm worried about all the complexities
of your day-to-day.

01:09:02.877 --> 01:09:05.046
It's a lot, kid. I'm sorry.

01:09:05.129 --> 01:09:08.216
So what? You don't want
to work together anymore?

01:09:08.299 --> 01:09:12.303
Well, it's just the current situation
isn't fair to you, either.

01:09:12.386 --> 01:09:17.265
I can't commit to you 100%
if I got other things on my mind,

01:09:17.350 --> 01:09:20.019
which unfortunately I do.
The stable.

01:09:20.103 --> 01:09:22.731
Sandy, let's not do this right now.

01:09:24.107 --> 01:09:26.776
Let's take a minute and think it over.

01:09:26.859 --> 01:09:28.778
I don't need a minute.

01:09:28.862 --> 01:09:32.406
I promised your dad
I'd always do what's best for you.

01:09:32.490 --> 01:09:33.825
This is best.

01:09:38.121 --> 01:09:39.287
So that's it?

01:09:41.165 --> 01:09:44.042
You ever need me, just beep.

01:09:46.379 --> 01:09:47.546
Sandy.

01:09:50.841 --> 01:09:51.843
Beep.

01:09:53.636 --> 01:09:55.429
You're gonna be all right, Courtney.

01:09:56.430 --> 01:09:57.849
You're gonna be a legend.

01:10:00.434 --> 01:10:01.895
Brightest star out there.

01:10:26.169 --> 01:10:30.381
Legend has it he stayed in that car
and cried for... six hours?

01:10:35.428 --> 01:10:38.973
Someone called child services 'cause
they thought a little girl was in trouble.

01:10:39.057 --> 01:10:40.058
- Yeah.
- In a car.

01:10:44.729 --> 01:10:46.690
I mean, not that anybody has a good cry,

01:10:46.773 --> 01:10:48.650
but his cry sounded
like some kind of, like,

01:10:48.733 --> 01:10:51.235
lonesome moose.

01:10:56.991 --> 01:10:59.661
Whatever the amount of time was
that he cried,

01:10:59.744 --> 01:11:01.705
he broke his own rules.
He just got too close.

01:11:01.788 --> 01:11:04.082
It was Alfred all over again.

01:11:04.165 --> 01:11:05.416
That was a tough time...

01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:13.341
'cause Sandy not only lost
his most talented client ever,

01:11:13.424 --> 01:11:17.095
but he also lost this person
he had feelings for.

01:11:18.096 --> 01:11:19.856
It must've been
especially painful for Sandy,

01:11:19.931 --> 01:11:22.266
because Courtney Clarke was everywhere.

01:11:25.394 --> 01:11:26.395
Whoo!

01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:36.781

Yeah, she's doing great. Uh...

01:11:58.762 --> 01:12:01.014
We're not working together
anymore, though.

01:12:02.098 --> 01:12:04.683

01:12:06.144 --> 01:12:08.396
Yeah. That makes sense.

01:12:09.230 --> 01:12:11.775
It makes sense if I kill you, Arsenio.

01:12:12.901 --> 01:12:14.110

What have we got here?

01:13:49.831 --> 01:13:52.291
Sandy!

01:13:52.375 --> 01:13:54.418
I was scared you wouldn't come.

01:13:55.962 --> 01:13:59.298
Hey. Where's Peter? Is he doing PT?

01:13:59.382 --> 01:14:02.551
Sandy, why don't you
take off your shoes?

01:14:02.635 --> 01:14:05.138
Take off my... Oh, for your rug?

01:14:05.221 --> 01:14:07.140
You know, my shoes are actually cleaner

01:14:07.223 --> 01:14:09.767
than my socks, but...

01:14:09.851 --> 01:14:11.269
And here we are.

01:14:12.896 --> 01:14:14.856
- Hey, hey.
- And here's your throne.

01:14:14.939 --> 01:14:16.983
Why don't you sit down, Sandy?

01:14:17.066 --> 01:14:19.152
- Hey.
- What would you like to drink?

01:14:19.235 --> 01:14:21.362
You know, I got a bit of a sour stomach.

01:14:21.445 --> 01:14:25.533
If you got Dr. Brown's black cherry diet,
that would be perfect.

01:14:27.493 --> 01:14:30.538
Or a big glass of whiskey.
Either way is...

01:14:40.298 --> 01:14:41.299
Oh, look.

01:14:41.883 --> 01:14:43.634
Ah.

01:14:47.388 --> 01:14:51.600
Did you ever see
that naughty little movie, 9½ Weeks?

01:14:51.684 --> 01:14:53.019
No, I didn't.

01:14:53.102 --> 01:14:56.314
I saw Problem Child, though.
That kid was hysterical.

01:14:58.482 --> 01:15:02.486
Well, not as funny as that.
Look at you.

01:15:03.321 --> 01:15:06.365
- Peter's been sick for a long time.
- Yeah.

01:15:07.366 --> 01:15:09.827
And a woman yearns for a man's touch.

01:15:10.536 --> 01:15:12.038
Hey, no, that's natural.

01:15:12.121 --> 01:15:13.998
Are you a man, Sandy?

01:15:15.083 --> 01:15:16.875
I don't know. I...

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:19.545
I was bar mitzvahed,
but that was a long time ago.

01:15:22.465 --> 01:15:24.467
- You know what I love about you?
- Yeah?

01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:26.760
Your voice.

01:15:26.844 --> 01:15:29.013
Come on. I've got a surprise.

01:15:30.348 --> 01:15:31.533
- Come along.
- Hey, what's this?

01:15:31.557 --> 01:15:33.851
- Just sit here. Now, sit.
- Oh! Oh, yeah.

01:15:33.935 --> 01:15:36.520
Aye, aye, aye! Yeah!

01:15:36.604 --> 01:15:38.397
Touch me, Sandy. Touch me.

01:15:38.481 --> 01:15:41.484
Well, I... I was just walking
on the carpet in my socks.

01:15:41.567 --> 01:15:46.530
- I don't wanna zap you.
- Oh. You can zap me. Just zap me.

01:15:50.243 --> 01:15:51.995
Cindy!

01:16:01.712 --> 01:16:05.924
Don't worry about Peter.
He only wants my happiness.

01:16:06.009 --> 01:16:07.260
Yeah.

01:16:13.807 --> 01:16:16.310
I can't do it. I can't.

01:16:16.394 --> 01:16:18.854
- I'd feel better if we...
- Don't, Sandy, please.

01:16:18.938 --> 01:16:21.440
- Don't leave. Stay here.
- Oh...

01:16:21.524 --> 01:16:23.359
We... we could put a blanket
over his head.

01:16:24.193 --> 01:16:28.156
That's... that's actually a thought.

01:16:28.239 --> 01:16:30.908
No. He says no. He said... I'm sorry.

01:16:30.992 --> 01:16:34.120
I consider Peter a friend,

01:16:34.203 --> 01:16:38.041
whether he's alive or dead
or in a vegetative state.

01:16:38.124 --> 01:16:40.501
Thanks for the offer, okay?

01:16:41.710 --> 01:16:44.963
I got the shock! I knew I... The socks.

01:16:52.305 --> 01:16:53.306
Pervert.

01:16:58.644 --> 01:16:59.770
- Cindy!
- Cindy!

01:16:59.853 --> 01:17:01.147
Madonna!

01:17:01.230 --> 01:17:02.315
Melissa!

01:17:03.191 --> 01:17:05.734
Wrapping up the CDs.

01:17:05.818 --> 01:17:07.945
Doing too good a job. I feel that...

01:17:09.405 --> 01:17:12.991
Just... a little bit overzealous
with the wrapping is my feeling.

01:17:13.076 --> 01:17:16.370
What is the security on this thing?

01:17:16.454 --> 01:17:17.746
It's a $12 item.

01:17:17.830 --> 01:17:19.748
They got it wrapped up
like the Hope Diamond.

01:17:20.874 --> 01:17:22.668
It's impossible
that they have cellophane...

01:17:22.751 --> 01:17:26.922
What are you doing? You look gloomy.
Reiser's killing out there. Come on.

01:17:27.005 --> 01:17:29.675
You're like a monkey with a coconut.
You're just looking at it...

01:17:29.758 --> 01:17:32.612
He's killing the jokes that I wrote.
It should be me up there killing it.

01:17:32.636 --> 01:17:36.307
Next year, it will be.
CBS sees your jokes work now.

01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:39.227
Next year, you'll be telling those jokes,
'cause you wrote 'em.

01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:46.109
You want me to do the jokes
he's telling right now

01:17:46.192 --> 01:17:47.193
on next year's Grammys?

01:17:47.276 --> 01:17:49.070
But you do 'em in your voice.

01:17:49.153 --> 01:17:51.631
But the punch lines are the same.
People have heard them already.

01:17:51.655 --> 01:17:53.199
You do new punch lines.

01:17:53.282 --> 01:17:55.409
So then they're new...
They're new jokes.

01:17:55.493 --> 01:17:57.661
No, but you're doing 'em in your voice.

01:17:57.745 --> 01:17:59.122
I wanna strangle you.

01:17:59.205 --> 01:18:00.765
- Don't say "your voice" again.
- What are you...

01:18:00.789 --> 01:18:02.509
I'm gonna kill you
if you say "in my voice."

01:18:02.541 --> 01:18:04.668
- Would you stop? I can't ever...
- Sandy?

01:18:07.255 --> 01:18:08.256
Courtney.

01:18:09.507 --> 01:18:11.259
Look at you!

01:18:11.342 --> 01:18:14.845
- Hey! Hey.
- Hey! Oh.

01:18:16.639 --> 01:18:20.518
You, uh, remember my, uh,
client Paul Reiser?

01:18:21.519 --> 01:18:23.646
- Kevin Connors.
- Kevin!

01:18:24.355 --> 01:18:26.440
They should have had you host this show.

01:18:26.524 --> 01:18:30.569
Paul Reiser is usually funny,
but his jokes tonight are just corny.

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:34.573
- You still doing Atkins? I see.
- Atkins.

01:18:34.657 --> 01:18:36.377
- You look great!
- Thank you. Well, my God.

01:18:36.450 --> 01:18:38.095
- I look good? Look at you.
- You look so good!

01:18:38.119 --> 01:18:40.829
I have been following you.
You are doing so well.

01:18:40.913 --> 01:18:44.500
The Grammy tonight. Did I tell you
when that was gonna happen, huh?

01:18:44.583 --> 01:18:46.127
You deserve it all. You really do.

01:18:46.210 --> 01:18:49.505
You deserve it, too.
I wouldn't be here without you.

01:18:49.588 --> 01:18:52.675
Are you kidding me?
You cannot stop a shooting star.

01:18:52.758 --> 01:18:54.635
- Aw.
- Our scientists have proven this.

01:18:55.261 --> 01:18:57.221
You are unbelievable, Sandy.

01:18:57.305 --> 01:18:59.307
How's Bling? Where is he?

01:18:59.390 --> 01:19:02.560
Yeah, he's my label guy.
He's not my guy-guy anymore.

01:19:02.643 --> 01:19:05.979
- Well, I'm so sorry. That's...
- Don't be.

01:19:06.063 --> 01:19:07.898
Things happen for a reason.

01:19:07.981 --> 01:19:09.581
I scored us each a goodie bag, my sweet.

01:19:09.608 --> 01:19:11.860
- Hi, cuteness.
- Can I keep your PlayStation?

01:19:11.944 --> 01:19:13.196
Yes.

01:19:13.279 --> 01:19:18.909
Guys, this is my new boyfriend, Ra...
Say it for me, babe.

01:19:18.992 --> 01:19:20.411
Ramiro Alejandro.

01:19:20.494 --> 01:19:24.207
- Sandy Wexler.
- Nice to meet you, Ramir...

01:19:24.290 --> 01:19:26.083
- Ramiro Alejandro.
- I know.

01:19:26.167 --> 01:19:29.295
Oh, is this the old Make-A-Wish guy
you were telling me about?

01:19:29.378 --> 01:19:32.005
No. No, we used to work together.

01:19:32.089 --> 01:19:35.050
Hey, you wanna come to Clive Davis'
after-party? You could ride with us.

01:19:35.133 --> 01:19:36.969
I, uh, would love to.

01:19:37.052 --> 01:19:39.305
- I, uh, have to go somewhere.
- Aw.

01:19:39.388 --> 01:19:42.391
A client of mine... Amy Baskin.
You... you remember Amy.

01:19:42.475 --> 01:19:43.476
Yeah!

01:19:43.559 --> 01:19:47.813
Yes, well, she got the lead in
Sound of Music at the Pasadena Playhouse.

01:19:47.896 --> 01:19:51.817
- She'll be Partygoer Number One.
- Yeah, that's the lead.

01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:54.445
It is. She's... she's the lead partygoer.

01:19:54.528 --> 01:19:57.698
Let's get together real soon, Sandy.
Promise me.

01:19:57.781 --> 01:20:00.659
- I promise. You promise me this.
- Of course. What?

01:20:00.743 --> 01:20:02.103
- After Clive's party...
- Mmm-hmm.

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:04.538
- You put on the ugly duckling hat...
- Oh, gosh.

01:20:04.622 --> 01:20:06.582
And you remind yourself
where you came from.

01:20:06.665 --> 01:20:07.958
Not on this hair.

01:20:08.041 --> 01:20:10.043
- Like we... Nope, not on your hair.
- Courtney...

01:20:10.127 --> 01:20:11.629
- You promise?
- We have to go.

01:20:11.712 --> 01:20:13.422
- I promise. Okay.
- I gotta see you. Okay.

01:20:13.506 --> 01:20:15.299
Good to see you, babe.

01:20:15.383 --> 01:20:18.844
Nice meeting you, Sammy!
Hope they find a cure for you, buddy.

01:20:18.927 --> 01:20:20.721
Buddy, move. Move!

01:20:20.804 --> 01:20:22.604
- Get out the way!
- Which way are you moving?

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:23.825
- Okay, go!
- Sandy, move! Sandy!

01:20:23.849 --> 01:20:25.643
That was another tough goodbye for Sandy.

01:20:25.726 --> 01:20:29.021
He... he didn't even know if he
would ever see or talk to Courtney again.

01:20:29.104 --> 01:20:30.564
Of course he kept himself busy.

01:20:30.648 --> 01:20:32.149
He actually signed someone

01:20:32.233 --> 01:20:35.110
who was involved in the biggest form
of entertainment in the '90s.

01:20:35.193 --> 01:20:36.695
Wrestling. Professional wrestling.

01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:42.576
Yeah!

01:20:51.835 --> 01:20:52.836
Yeah!

01:21:02.346 --> 01:21:07.184
Go to sleep, baby!
It's night-night time!

01:21:18.195 --> 01:21:19.905
- You're the man, Bedtime.
- Isn't he?

01:21:19.988 --> 01:21:21.716
Oh, I know you're gonna
take the title on Sunday.

01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:24.785
I'm gonna make 'em go night-night.

01:21:25.869 --> 01:21:28.664
- Thank you.
- I'm gonna lose.

01:21:28.747 --> 01:21:30.624
You don't know that. Hang on, please.

01:21:30.708 --> 01:21:33.627
Yeah, I do know that. I got the script.

01:21:33.711 --> 01:21:37.340
Tsunami sits on my face until I tap out.
I'm never gonna be the champ.

01:21:37.423 --> 01:21:38.591
Okay, look.

01:21:38.674 --> 01:21:42.720
The good thing is, you're gonna have
a grown man sit on your face

01:21:42.803 --> 01:21:46.056
and the entire world is gonna be watching.
That's a positive.

01:21:46.139 --> 01:21:48.285
- That's not a positive.
- It's a positive because it's...

01:21:48.309 --> 01:21:49.602
- The fame factor.
- What?

01:21:49.685 --> 01:21:52.885
Hey, Bedtime. Will you rock me like a baby
while my brother Dicky gets a picture?

01:21:52.938 --> 01:21:54.857
- What are you, six?
- Yeah, of course he will.

01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:57.126
- Of course he will do it.
- Do you see the size of this guy?

01:21:57.150 --> 01:21:58.193
Just get on it.

01:21:58.276 --> 01:22:02.197
Oh. Hang on, guys.
My cellular device is ringing.

01:22:02.948 --> 01:22:05.283
And I hit this, and I pull this.

01:22:06.118 --> 01:22:07.244
Wexler Artists.

01:22:07.328 --> 01:22:09.747
Mr. Wexler, it is Chippy from Dan Tana's.

01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:14.585
Chippy! Hey! How's it going?
How was your vacation to Cincinnati?

01:22:14.668 --> 01:22:17.295
It was, uh, not a vacation.
My mother died.

01:22:17.380 --> 01:22:18.922
I went to Cincinnati for the funeral.

01:22:19.006 --> 01:22:21.258
Oh, yeah. That's right. How's your mother?

01:22:22.885 --> 01:22:24.094
What are you calling for?

01:22:24.177 --> 01:22:27.890
We have a delicate situation with a client
of yours who has had too much to drink.

01:22:27.973 --> 01:22:30.726
And unfortunately,
there are very many paparazzi out front.

01:22:31.935 --> 01:22:34.104
Oh, boy. Was it Gary or Kevin?

01:22:39.276 --> 01:22:41.236
Yeah, I chased him
for six or seven blocks.

01:22:41.319 --> 01:22:45.073
Just come on. Get a life, guys. Jeez.

01:22:51.329 --> 01:22:53.123
- Bring me to the package.
- This way.

01:23:02.716 --> 01:23:03.926
Courtney?

01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:08.346
What the... What's going on, kiddo?

01:23:08.931 --> 01:23:11.224
Sandy! They found you!

01:23:11.308 --> 01:23:12.768
Yeah, they found me.

01:23:12.851 --> 01:23:16.188
You just stay put, okay?
You stay right there.

01:23:20.984 --> 01:23:23.362
Aw, Sandy to the rescue.

01:23:24.279 --> 01:23:27.575
No one can find out about this.
You understand me, Chippy? Not even you.

01:23:28.617 --> 01:23:29.785
Okay, Sandy.

01:23:31.203 --> 01:23:32.663
- Okay.
- Sandy!

01:23:34.707 --> 01:23:37.710
What? She'll suffocate?
Is that what you're saying?

01:23:37.793 --> 01:23:40.253
Courtney! Courtney! Courtney!

01:23:40.337 --> 01:23:42.214
Go jump in a lake, fellas!

01:23:47.970 --> 01:23:52.641
Ah! No, no, no, no! Oh, come on!
Oh, please, please, please.

01:23:53.851 --> 01:23:56.394
Keep your voices down. Let her sleep.

01:23:58.021 --> 01:24:01.525
That's right. Just sleep. Sleep, sleep.

01:24:02.109 --> 01:24:04.445
Let me get this up for you.

01:24:05.362 --> 01:24:08.031
And you... you're breathing.

01:24:08.782 --> 01:24:09.950
Are you breathing?

01:24:10.659 --> 01:24:12.661
Yeah, there it is. Okay.

01:24:12.745 --> 01:24:13.829
You'll be all right.

01:24:15.956 --> 01:24:19.793
I'm telling you, he's the best
ventriloquist in the business. He...

01:24:19.877 --> 01:24:21.336
You don't see him talking?

01:24:21.419 --> 01:24:26.341
No, you see his lips move slightly,
but that's not the important thing.

01:24:26.424 --> 01:24:28.969
The important thing
is what the guy is saying.

01:24:29.052 --> 01:24:32.097
No one looks at the lips
if they're laughing, then...

01:24:32.180 --> 01:24:33.849
No, kids love him.

01:24:33.932 --> 01:24:37.686
That's why I'm bringing it up
to you. The kids will love this guy.

01:24:37.770 --> 01:24:41.273
He's got curly hair,
and... and he's got the mustache.

01:24:41.356 --> 01:24:42.357
I'm sorry.

01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:45.402
- Linda, I'm... I'm just asking if you...
- Do you want some breakfast?

01:24:45.486 --> 01:24:47.404
- Sandy...
- If you could just

01:24:47.488 --> 01:24:49.447
put a good word in for me. That's it.

01:24:49.532 --> 01:24:51.617
Maybe put his headshot on his desk.

01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:54.036
- I really wish I could, Sandy.
- Hey, just meat, right?

01:24:54.119 --> 01:24:56.454
Oh, yeah. Hold on. Just meat.

01:24:57.498 --> 01:24:58.666
Just meet with him.

01:24:59.374 --> 01:25:01.752
That's all I'm asking you to do.
Just meet with him.

01:25:01.835 --> 01:25:03.003
All right, Sandy.

01:25:03.086 --> 01:25:06.464
Thank you, Linda! Thank you!

01:25:06.549 --> 01:25:08.425
Happy birthday on Wednesday.

01:25:08.509 --> 01:25:10.803
- How did you know that?
- Yeah, 'cause I know.

01:25:10.886 --> 01:25:13.138
'Cause I know. I know everything.

01:25:14.973 --> 01:25:17.518
How good is this? Phenomenal.

01:25:17.601 --> 01:25:19.562
No one knows
how to cook health food like...

01:25:19.645 --> 01:25:22.105
You're fantastic. You can do it all.

01:25:22.815 --> 01:25:26.193
I owe you for last night.
I'm embarrassed.

01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:29.362
Hey, everybody gets zonked
once in a while.

01:25:29.446 --> 01:25:31.824
The question is, why are we doing it?

01:25:33.075 --> 01:25:34.493
I don't know. I...

01:25:35.035 --> 01:25:36.494
I just broke up with Billy.

01:25:36.579 --> 01:25:40.332
Billy? Who's Billy?
What happened to the Marc Anthony fella?

01:25:40.415 --> 01:25:41.959
Marc Anthony? Come on, Sandy.

01:25:42.042 --> 01:25:44.587
Pick up a People magazine
every once in a while.

01:25:44.670 --> 01:25:46.755
That was three boyfriends ago.

01:25:46.839 --> 01:25:50.425
Oh, hey, I gotta start writing
some of these names down.

01:25:50.508 --> 01:25:53.637
I'm getting lost.
I'm joking around with you.

01:25:53.721 --> 01:25:56.139
What you're doing's perfectly natural.

01:25:56.223 --> 01:25:58.642
Anyone in your position
would be doing the same.

01:25:58.726 --> 01:26:00.060
Look, Liza did it.

01:26:00.769 --> 01:26:03.856
Elizabeth Taylor did it.
Sherwood Schwartz did it.

01:26:03.939 --> 01:26:06.483
Just my life.

01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:09.319
It feels out of control.

01:26:09.402 --> 01:26:13.782
I can't connect with anybody.
I don't... I just don't feel safe.

01:26:13.866 --> 01:26:15.826
I can't even go ten feet

01:26:15.909 --> 01:26:20.706
without the paparazzi following me,
taking pictures of me, spying on me.

01:26:20.789 --> 01:26:22.350
I don't even want to
leave my house anymore.

01:26:22.374 --> 01:26:24.001
What? You gotta leave your house.

01:26:24.084 --> 01:26:26.962
Even Michael Jackson
leaves his house once in a while.

01:26:27.713 --> 01:26:28.547
How?

01:26:28.631 --> 01:26:31.634
He just don't look like Michael Jackson.

01:26:35.470 --> 01:26:37.555
Excuse me, sir.
You know what time it is?

01:26:40.517 --> 01:26:42.060
Can you do me a favor?

01:26:42.144 --> 01:26:45.689
Courtney Clarke was just in there.
Uh, could you find out where she went?

01:26:45.773 --> 01:26:48.525
This is...
Somebody just got their life back!

01:26:48.609 --> 01:26:51.278
Why do you own this stuff?

01:26:51.361 --> 01:26:53.739
Why? Those are my workout clothes.

01:26:53.822 --> 01:26:55.699
You work out?

01:26:55.783 --> 01:26:59.828
Suzanne Somers personally gave me
one of the very first ThighMasters.

01:26:59.912 --> 01:27:01.163
I use it as much as I can.

01:27:01.246 --> 01:27:02.915
This conversation is over.

01:27:02.998 --> 01:27:05.292
What? It's for firm thighs and buttocks.

01:27:05.375 --> 01:27:07.836
- Sandy, please stop talking.
- All right.

01:27:08.586 --> 01:27:09.672
What we gonna do today?

01:27:09.755 --> 01:27:12.633
What we gonna do today?
Anything you want, kiddo.

01:27:12.716 --> 01:27:15.761
- Okay, lead the way, ThighMaster.
- Hey! Now, wait a minute.

01:27:15.844 --> 01:27:18.764
- By the way, the dogs are good for cardio.
- Oh.

01:27:19.807 --> 01:27:20.808
What does that mean?

01:27:20.891 --> 01:27:22.059
You'll see.

01:27:22.142 --> 01:27:24.895
- Go! Run! Run! Run!
- Okay! Okay!

01:27:26.772 --> 01:27:28.481
Well, here comes the test.

01:27:29.692 --> 01:27:32.485
Look at that. Look at that. Huh?

01:27:32.569 --> 01:27:34.154
Wow.

01:27:35.698 --> 01:27:37.115
Why am I golfing?

01:27:37.199 --> 01:27:39.034
Golfing is very relaxing.

01:27:39.117 --> 01:27:42.412
You don't have to think
about nothing but smacking that ball.

01:27:42.495 --> 01:27:44.206
Have you ever played before?

01:27:44.289 --> 01:27:47.125
- No.
- No? It's quite easy.

01:27:47.209 --> 01:27:50.587
I'll take out the big stick
'cause it's fun to hit 'em far.

01:27:50.671 --> 01:27:54.216
It's always good to warm up a little bit.
Ow! Okay.

01:27:54.299 --> 01:27:57.135
I got actually a little problem
in the back.

01:27:57.219 --> 01:27:59.596
- You okay?
- Yeah. Just give me one sec.

01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:00.681
God damn it.

01:28:00.764 --> 01:28:02.659
- Should I call for help?
- No, I'll be all right.

01:28:02.683 --> 01:28:04.893
Just give me one sec.
I just gotta stretch.

01:28:06.687 --> 01:28:09.815
All right. Just give me one more sec.
I do need help.

01:28:16.989 --> 01:28:18.531
You need to go to the bathroom?

01:28:18.615 --> 01:28:21.159
No, I'm just... I'm getting it lined up.

01:28:22.285 --> 01:28:25.831
Let's just say goodbye
to all our troubles, okay?

01:28:25.914 --> 01:28:26.915
Okay.

01:28:26.999 --> 01:28:30.002
If you got any problems,
put 'em into the ball and send them away.

01:28:32.504 --> 01:28:35.257
Is it supposed to curve
off to the right like that?

01:28:35.340 --> 01:28:37.509
Yeah, I was playing a dogleg right.

01:28:37.592 --> 01:28:39.302
- A dogleg?
- Right.

01:28:39.386 --> 01:28:42.389
You gotta bend it around the trees,
and that's what I was going for.

01:28:42.472 --> 01:28:44.557
- Can I try it?
- You wanna try? Okay.

01:28:44.641 --> 01:28:46.601
I was gonna show you
a little more, but okay.

01:28:46.684 --> 01:28:48.270
- Okay.
- So let me...

01:28:48.353 --> 01:28:50.123
You know, maybe you should
tee it up for yourself.

01:28:50.147 --> 01:28:51.439
Tee it up. Here.

01:28:51.523 --> 01:28:53.901
- You tee it up, and you say goodbye.
- Right here.

01:28:53.984 --> 01:28:54.985
Okay.

01:28:55.068 --> 01:28:57.005
And just have a good time
and don't worry about where it goes.

01:28:57.029 --> 01:28:58.739
- Let's see.
- Okay.

01:29:03.243 --> 01:29:06.079
Am I being hustled right now?
What was that?

01:29:06.163 --> 01:29:10.250
I swear I didn't play every day growing up
with my Uncle Davey who's a golf pro.

01:29:10.333 --> 01:29:12.127
Oh, well...

01:29:12.210 --> 01:29:14.755
Does this guy need a manager because...

01:29:14.838 --> 01:29:16.673
- Come over here.
- What are we doing?

01:29:16.757 --> 01:29:18.037
We gotta work on that slice leg.

01:29:18.091 --> 01:29:19.652
- Oh, my God.
- Here you go. Here you go.

01:29:19.676 --> 01:29:21.863
- This is your day. I don't want to...
- No. No, no, no. You got it?

01:29:21.887 --> 01:29:24.222
- You're okay with it?
- Oh, it's my day now. Come on.

01:29:24.306 --> 01:29:25.515
- In the hips.
- In the hips.

01:29:25.598 --> 01:29:26.599
Here we go.

01:29:26.683 --> 01:29:29.394
Oh! All right! Hold on now.

01:29:30.020 --> 01:29:32.605
Huh? I beg your pardon?

01:29:32.689 --> 01:29:33.690
Tell me. Tell me.

01:29:33.774 --> 01:29:34.900
A company called Pixar...

01:29:34.983 --> 01:29:36.294
- Pixar?
- Wants me to do a voice

01:29:36.318 --> 01:29:38.445
in some animated movie
about a bunch of toys.

01:29:38.528 --> 01:29:39.905
Cartoons are dead.

01:29:39.988 --> 01:29:41.489
Tell 'em pass.

01:29:41.573 --> 01:29:44.076
- Okay. Sandy knows best.
- I mean, come on. I do know best.

01:29:44.159 --> 01:29:48.455
The lady at Chili's said they'll keep it
open till 10:30 for us, so that's good.

01:29:48.538 --> 01:29:49.873
How you feeling anyway?

01:29:49.957 --> 01:29:51.041
As good as anybody can feel

01:29:51.124 --> 01:29:53.444
knowing they're about to get
their face sat on by that guy.

01:29:54.252 --> 01:29:55.462
Damn, that's a big ass!

01:29:55.545 --> 01:29:57.172
- That's right...
- Get off me!

01:29:57.255 --> 01:30:00.342
Listen. Will you just trust me?
This is a good night for you.

01:30:00.425 --> 01:30:01.551
Trust you? It's humiliating.

01:30:01.634 --> 01:30:04.346
My kids are out there, man!
My wife might not ever kiss me again!

01:30:04.429 --> 01:30:07.390
Randy Savage had to get whooped 24 times

01:30:07.474 --> 01:30:10.768
before he finally pinned Ted DiBiase
to win the belt, man!

01:30:10.853 --> 01:30:13.373
How does your platinum-selling ass
know about wrestling history?

01:30:13.438 --> 01:30:16.608
I'm from Alaska.
It was either watch wrestling or fish.

01:30:16.691 --> 01:30:18.276
Is that adorable?

01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:21.279
Will you just take it all in
and promise me you'll have fun?

01:30:21.363 --> 01:30:23.823
This is a big night for you.
Look at me.

01:30:23.907 --> 01:30:26.493
Man, how does your goofy ass
have me feeling good right now?

01:30:26.576 --> 01:30:27.577
That's impossible!

01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:30.372
Because you know I love ya
and I'm your family.

01:30:30.455 --> 01:30:32.124
All right, good luck.

01:30:32.207 --> 01:30:33.541
Get out there!

01:30:38.171 --> 01:30:39.547
Yeah! Come on!

01:30:48.723 --> 01:30:50.808
Fight!

01:30:54.104 --> 01:30:55.188
Okay.

01:31:11.538 --> 01:31:12.747
No!

01:31:19.671 --> 01:31:20.964
Break, break, break, break!

01:31:21.798 --> 01:31:24.717
Hey, what are you doing?
Stick to the script.

01:31:24.801 --> 01:31:26.695
I'm sorry, Tsunami.
You're gonna have to earn this one.

01:31:26.719 --> 01:31:27.930
What? Hey...

01:31:32.225 --> 01:31:34.852
This is bullshit.
I'm supposed to win.

01:31:34.937 --> 01:31:37.522
This happening?
Huh, this is happening?

01:31:37.605 --> 01:31:38.690
Well, bring it on!

01:31:44.737 --> 01:31:46.739
Okay, get back there, champ!

01:31:49.492 --> 01:31:51.536
There it is. Now it's getting real.

01:31:55.707 --> 01:31:56.916
Thank you very much!

01:32:01.463 --> 01:32:02.463
What is this?

01:32:10.097 --> 01:32:12.432
No, you're not! What's going on here?

01:32:21.733 --> 01:32:22.817
Say it!

01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:25.112
It's time to go night-night!

01:32:45.340 --> 01:32:48.051
- I got the belt! I'm the champ!
- You the man! You the man!

01:32:48.135 --> 01:32:50.928
- Sandy! How?
- What do you... Huh?

01:32:51.513 --> 01:32:56.684
The referee is a client, and
Wexler Artists look out for each other.

01:32:56.768 --> 01:32:58.978
Oh, man!
Those guys are gonna fire his ass!

01:32:59.062 --> 01:33:00.605
Of course they are,

01:33:00.688 --> 01:33:04.567
but I already got him a job as a referee
for the Harlem Globetrotters.

01:33:04.651 --> 01:33:06.986
- I know. I understand.
- You're never going to work again!

01:33:07.070 --> 01:33:09.447
What do you say, champ? Proud of ya.

01:33:10.365 --> 01:33:13.035
Oh! I'm so happy, Sandy!

01:33:13.118 --> 01:33:16.621
I love you. This is your moment.
This is all you.

01:33:16.704 --> 01:33:19.332
I'm just so happy for you
and your wife and your kids.

01:33:19.416 --> 01:33:20.667
Okay? That's all I want.

01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:23.086
- I love you! I love you!
- You deserve everything!

01:33:23.170 --> 01:33:25.880
- Courtney, get in here!
- You deserve everything!

01:33:25.963 --> 01:33:27.674
Uh, we do have to go to Chili's, though.

01:33:27.757 --> 01:33:30.427
I told the lady we'd be there
by 10:30, so let's get going.

01:33:30.510 --> 01:33:33.030
- Why are you talking about Chili's now?
- I just don't wanna...

01:33:33.096 --> 01:33:36.224
I don't want her to screw us
for the next time, you know. Let's go.

01:33:50.238 --> 01:33:52.865
Eat up those baby backs, guys.

01:33:54.784 --> 01:33:59.706
How do you take care of everybody
and never worry about yourself?

01:34:00.915 --> 01:34:02.667
How do you become Sandy?

01:34:02.750 --> 01:34:04.294
Oh, well, listen.

01:34:04.377 --> 01:34:07.964
How do you get to Carnegie Hall?
Practice, practice, practice.

01:34:08.047 --> 01:34:09.674
- Hmm.
- Huh?

01:34:12.510 --> 01:34:14.679
I wish I could stay here.

01:34:14.762 --> 01:34:17.557
This is the best day I've had in years.

01:34:19.226 --> 01:34:22.019
Listen, you can stay as long as you want.

01:34:23.105 --> 01:34:25.273
I'm supposed to go to New York tomorrow

01:34:25.357 --> 01:34:28.318
and shoot this VH1 thing
with Lenny Kravitz.

01:34:29.068 --> 01:34:30.069
Yeah?

01:34:31.363 --> 01:34:32.655
That's a good thing.

01:34:33.740 --> 01:34:34.741
Is it?

01:34:36.284 --> 01:34:37.619
Then why don't I wanna go?

01:34:43.208 --> 01:34:44.667
Tell me I don't have to go, Sandy.

01:34:46.628 --> 01:34:48.255
No, no, no.

01:34:49.672 --> 01:34:50.798
Why won't you?

01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:54.802
'Cause that's not my job anymore.

01:34:55.970 --> 01:34:57.347
Okay.

01:34:58.181 --> 01:34:59.682
What do you want me to do?

01:35:02.477 --> 01:35:07.357
What I want you to do
is concentrate on your career.

01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:09.108
Music comes first.

01:35:10.318 --> 01:35:11.903
Go to New York.

01:35:16.408 --> 01:35:19.035
- You know what?
- What?

01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:22.455
You're a jerk.

01:35:32.257 --> 01:35:34.050
Oh, God, yes!

01:35:35.260 --> 01:35:36.719
What was that?

01:35:37.595 --> 01:35:39.931
- Firuz!
- Oh, all right, then.

01:35:40.014 --> 01:35:41.724
I'll go take a walk or something.

01:35:42.434 --> 01:35:44.561
Have the best night of your life, Sandy.

01:35:45.687 --> 01:35:47.146
I'm trying.

01:35:49.732 --> 01:35:51.901
Ultimately, I have to move.

01:36:29.564 --> 01:36:32.734
The day was perfect, the night was better.

01:36:32.817 --> 01:36:35.320
Thank you. I'm off to New York.

01:36:35.403 --> 01:36:37.239
Sandy knows best.

01:36:37.322 --> 01:36:38.573
Love, Court.

01:36:46.205 --> 01:36:49.000
- Pick that up!
- Shut up, Firuz!

01:36:52.211 --> 01:36:53.880
Just shut up.

01:36:53.963 --> 01:36:55.632
Success can be really lonely.

01:36:55.715 --> 01:36:58.343
That's why you kinda long
for someone to share it with.

01:36:58.426 --> 01:37:00.928
So a week later,
her and Lenny Kravitz moved in together.

01:37:01.012 --> 01:37:03.598
And then two weeks later after that,
moved out.

01:37:03.681 --> 01:37:05.016
And she moved on to Johnny Depp.

01:37:05.099 --> 01:37:06.369
- Chris Cornell.
- George Clooney.

01:37:06.393 --> 01:37:08.227
- Ziggy Marley.
- Pauly Shore.

01:37:08.311 --> 01:37:09.937
I went out with her?

01:37:10.021 --> 01:37:12.315
Man, Sandy was messed up.

01:37:13.650 --> 01:37:15.318
Sir, are you committing suicide?

01:37:15.402 --> 01:37:17.404
'Cause I don't think
I'm allowed to film that!

01:37:17.487 --> 01:37:19.113
No, I'm not!

01:37:19.196 --> 01:37:21.366
I'm fine, thank you very much!

01:37:21.449 --> 01:37:25.202
She can date whoever she wants to date!
That's her thing!

01:37:25.287 --> 01:37:27.830
- He's talking to me.
- He's talking to you?

01:37:34.045 --> 01:37:38.132
Sandy, that pool looks far away.
How long until my skin starts burning?

01:37:38.215 --> 01:37:44.055
I think the safety advisor
said four seconds you get

01:37:44.138 --> 01:37:45.890
before you must be wet.

01:37:45.973 --> 01:37:47.733
You think he said that
or he said that? Four?

01:37:47.809 --> 01:37:51.020
I got to admit, I haven't been sleeping.
I'm just so tired.

01:37:51.103 --> 01:37:52.783
I don't care. I'm about to be lit on fire!

01:37:52.855 --> 01:37:55.232
He said it! He said what he said.

01:37:55.317 --> 01:37:59.236
Okay, here we go. Right calf first.

01:37:59.321 --> 01:38:01.489
Okay. Okay.

01:38:01.572 --> 01:38:03.908
- Okay!
- Okay, go, go, go!

01:38:03.992 --> 01:38:05.868
Whoo! Yeah!

01:38:07.286 --> 01:38:09.246
What? Oh!

01:38:09.997 --> 01:38:11.541
No!

01:38:14.251 --> 01:38:16.045
No!

01:38:17.046 --> 01:38:20.800
Okay. So birds sleep at night,
but the bats wake up.

01:38:20.883 --> 01:38:22.469
Okay.

01:38:22.552 --> 01:38:25.847
Now we know. Now we know.
No, this is a good thing.

01:38:29.851 --> 01:38:32.186
I'm telling you, Bud,
he can follow anybody.

01:38:32.269 --> 01:38:35.440
He can follow... He followed Minnie
at The Ice House recently.

01:38:35.523 --> 01:38:39.276
I know you don't like The Ice House.
I don't know why I said that. I'm sorry.

01:38:39.361 --> 01:38:41.028
All right, I'm gonna go watch Kevin.

01:38:41.654 --> 01:38:43.573
- Hey, Sandy.
- Kirby.

01:38:43.656 --> 01:38:44.657
You got a minute?

01:38:44.741 --> 01:38:47.535
Yeah, I'm going to watch
my client on stage.

01:38:47.619 --> 01:38:50.287
Actually, Kevin and I think
it's time for a change.

01:38:50.372 --> 01:38:51.831
He's dumping me through you?

01:38:51.914 --> 01:38:54.501
You gotta admit,
you've been a bit clingy. I'm telling ya.

01:38:54.584 --> 01:38:55.978
You're telling me? I'm telling you.

01:38:56.002 --> 01:38:57.086
So we agree.

01:38:58.505 --> 01:39:02.133
Bud, Alex, how are you guys?
Good to see you.

01:39:02.216 --> 01:39:04.218
It's all happening here tonight, isn't it?

01:39:10.016 --> 01:39:14.061
♪ You give me butterfly, butterflies ♪

01:39:14.145 --> 01:39:16.272
♪ Down in my soul ♪

Why the hell do you
have me singing that song?

01:39:21.611 --> 01:39:23.279
- They hated it!
- No.

01:39:23.362 --> 01:39:24.822
This is an awful idea, Sandy!

01:39:24.906 --> 01:39:28.117
No, I... I'm telling you,
you did better than you think!

01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:31.162
- You are out of your mind!
- No! No!

01:39:31.245 --> 01:39:32.705
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't.

01:39:32.789 --> 01:39:34.916
- It's time you go night-night.
- No night-night! No!

01:39:34.999 --> 01:39:37.334
- You're fired.
- Oh, God! Come on!

01:39:37.419 --> 01:39:40.797
No! You can't do that to me! Aah!

01:39:43.466 --> 01:39:45.134
We're done, Sandy. We're done!

01:39:45.217 --> 01:39:46.302
Don't say that.

01:39:51.683 --> 01:39:53.476
Your life is an adventure.

- Can I have some?

You said it was

Teddy!

01:41:26.694 --> 01:41:30.156
Wonderful news. Mr. Buttons is dead!

01:41:31.658 --> 01:41:33.159
You killed him?

01:41:33.242 --> 01:41:36.370
No! He hung himself!

01:41:36.453 --> 01:41:39.541
- Really?
- His time slot's open, guys.

01:41:39.624 --> 01:41:41.167
I got you the audition.

01:41:41.250 --> 01:41:43.753
It doesn't feel right.
I mean, I feel bad for the guy.

01:41:43.836 --> 01:41:45.838
Screw Mr. Buttons! It's our turn!

01:41:45.922 --> 01:41:50.009
- He couldn't take the pressure.
- He took the coward's way out.

01:41:50.092 --> 01:41:54.346
I gotta tell you, it's the first time
I... I agree with the puppets.

01:41:58.475 --> 01:42:01.103
Friend Boom Boom is gonna
sing a song for us today, kids.

01:42:01.187 --> 01:42:03.027
Would you like that?
Would you like to hear it?

01:42:04.523 --> 01:42:05.775
I hate singing.

01:42:05.858 --> 01:42:08.319
What are you talking about?
You sing all the time.

01:42:08.402 --> 01:42:10.738
You sing in the car,
you sing in the shower...

01:42:10.822 --> 01:42:12.574
You spy on me in the shower?

01:42:14.033 --> 01:42:17.078
- That is not what I meant.
- I can sing, Ted.

01:42:17.161 --> 01:42:20.331
- Would you like to hear that, kids?
- Yeah!

01:42:26.378 --> 01:42:28.089
You have something
in your throat, Heather?

01:42:28.172 --> 01:42:29.465
Yeah, your hand, dummy!

01:42:33.385 --> 01:42:35.930
I can't believe it.
These kids are eating your boy up!

01:42:36.013 --> 01:42:37.493
I mean, he could be the next Buttons.

01:42:37.556 --> 01:42:39.809
- Didn't I tell you? Didn't I say?
- Yeah, great.

01:42:39.892 --> 01:42:42.436
Hey! There's a caterpillar on your face.

01:42:43.688 --> 01:42:45.272
What's with you?
What, are you okay?

01:42:45.356 --> 01:42:47.984
- No, no, I, uh...
- Something wrong? There's something wrong?

01:42:48.067 --> 01:42:51.362
Maybe a little dizzy.
I had too many bacon bits this morning.

01:42:51.445 --> 01:42:54.448
Bacon Bits? What is that?
That's a dog food, no?

01:42:54.531 --> 01:42:56.701
No. Didn't say that on the box.

01:42:56.784 --> 01:43:00.246
Yeah, all right, whatever. Tell you what,
you come to my office in an hour.

01:43:00.329 --> 01:43:01.789
We'll hammer out a deal.

01:43:01.873 --> 01:43:04.959
I'll get your boy on the air ASAP.
Okay, bud?

01:43:05.042 --> 01:43:07.962
All righty. That makes me very happy.

01:43:10.506 --> 01:43:12.216
They absolutely loved you.

01:43:12.299 --> 01:43:14.802
- You're getting the job, Teddy.
- I did good. I did good.

01:43:14.886 --> 01:43:18.597
My only fear is they're gonna try
to lowball you on the deal, all right?

01:43:18.681 --> 01:43:21.142
The key to this meeting is tough talk.

01:43:21.809 --> 01:43:25.813
These TV jerks only respond
to bullying and aggression.

01:43:25.897 --> 01:43:28.440
Well, I'll let you handle all that, okay?

01:43:29.901 --> 01:43:33.445
I'm no doctor,
but Sandy look like crap on a stick.

01:43:33.529 --> 01:43:35.072
No, I'm fine.

01:43:35.156 --> 01:43:37.574
- Sandy!
- No.

01:43:37.659 --> 01:43:39.618
I think
he's having a heart attack.

01:43:39.702 --> 01:43:42.579
We... we gotta get you to a hospital.
Boom Boom, call an ambulance!

01:43:42.664 --> 01:43:49.086
No, Boom Boom.
First meeting, close deal, then hop-ital.

01:43:49.170 --> 01:43:51.338
Forget the meeting.
You can barely speak.

01:43:51.964 --> 01:43:55.301
But... you can.

01:43:58.763 --> 01:44:02.850
So what we saw in there
told us everything we need to know.

01:44:03.517 --> 01:44:06.312
We love Ted. The kids love Ted.

01:44:06.395 --> 01:44:08.022
That is... That's spectacular.

01:44:08.105 --> 01:44:09.648
Thank you. Thank you so much.

01:44:09.732 --> 01:44:12.819
But the fact is
he's never been on television.

01:44:12.902 --> 01:44:14.570
So here's the deal.

01:44:14.653 --> 01:44:19.701
Six episodes, 15 grand a pop,
and then we see what we do from there.

01:44:26.207 --> 01:44:28.250
Are you kidding me, Marty?

01:44:29.501 --> 01:44:33.089
- What?
- You think I'm a complete a-hole?

01:44:33.172 --> 01:44:34.548
No, no, no.

01:44:34.631 --> 01:44:37.093
Then why are you treating me like one?

01:44:37.676 --> 01:44:40.429
I think it's a reasonable
starting place, Sandy.

01:44:42.139 --> 01:44:45.517
Reasonable, Fishbein? It's dog crap.

01:44:46.102 --> 01:44:47.436
If we take this deal,

01:44:47.519 --> 01:44:51.733
my guy's gonna end up at the end of a rope
just like your last clown.

01:44:52.358 --> 01:44:54.568
- Whoa, man!
- All right. Sandy, Sandy. Take it easy.

01:44:54.651 --> 01:44:57.446
Take it easy. Just make us a counter.

01:44:58.823 --> 01:45:02.869
We want a two year...
Five year deal.

01:45:02.952 --> 01:45:04.036
Sandy, please.

01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:07.957
Twenty-four show minimum,
50 grand an episode,

01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:12.628
with a 200K bump
every year we're on the air.

01:45:13.295 --> 01:45:14.922
This guy's an animal.

01:45:15.006 --> 01:45:16.548
He's literally foaming at the mouth.

01:45:16.632 --> 01:45:19.718
And the puppets get
their own dressing rooms.

01:45:22.013 --> 01:45:23.097
Just kidding.

01:45:24.265 --> 01:45:25.391
Okay.

01:45:25.474 --> 01:45:29.603
Three years, 20 show minimum,
at the numbers you mentioned.

01:45:30.646 --> 01:45:31.688
Deal.

01:45:31.773 --> 01:45:35.484
Ted, welcome to the UPN family.

01:45:41.698 --> 01:45:47.204
And that's how Sandy died.
On the conference room floor at UPN.

01:45:48.956 --> 01:45:50.875
Just kidding.
They took him to the hospital.

01:45:52.334 --> 01:45:53.753
Where am I?

01:45:53.836 --> 01:45:56.798
You had a minor heart attack.
A warning shot.

01:45:57.506 --> 01:46:00.009
Probably due to stress. And meat.

01:46:00.092 --> 01:46:03.137
Just need to rest for a few days.
Here you go.

01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:13.772
This is too nice of a room for me.
I can't afford this.

01:46:13.856 --> 01:46:17.902
Come on, man. I wasn't gonna let you
slum it down in the regular people ward.

01:46:17.985 --> 01:46:20.696
First class all the way for my Sandman.

01:46:20.779 --> 01:46:23.240
- You came!
- Of course.

01:46:23.324 --> 01:46:25.742
Miss Clarke, I love your new album.

01:46:25.827 --> 01:46:27.470
I play it every day. I'm obsessed with it.

01:46:27.494 --> 01:46:28.495
Thank you.

01:46:28.579 --> 01:46:29.848
- You're so beautiful.
- Thank you.

01:46:29.872 --> 01:46:31.916
Can I touch you?

01:46:33.667 --> 01:46:36.295
Oh, I... I...
I just touched the queen!

01:46:36.378 --> 01:46:40.257
Oh, and you, sir, you need a new bedpan,
so I'm gonna grab that for you.

01:46:40.341 --> 01:46:43.219
- I used the bedpan while I was sleeping?
- Thanks.

01:46:44.803 --> 01:46:46.722
You did a new album?

01:46:46.805 --> 01:46:50.434
Oh. Don't you worry about that.
I want you to worry about getting better.

01:46:51.143 --> 01:46:54.271
It's scary, knowing your heart's not good.

01:46:54.355 --> 01:46:59.568
Sandy Wexler, you have
the biggest, best, strongest heart

01:46:59.651 --> 01:47:03.322
in this whole miserable town.
And that's a fact.

01:47:03.405 --> 01:47:05.116
Miserable town?

01:47:05.199 --> 01:47:08.494
It's been quite nice to you,
thank you very much.

01:47:08.577 --> 01:47:09.871
I guess.

01:47:09.954 --> 01:47:12.164
I just feel like I need a change,
you know?

01:47:13.916 --> 01:47:15.792
So I'm moving to Seattle.

01:47:15.877 --> 01:47:18.795
Seattle? What are you talking about?

01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:25.177
That whole grunge thing, that's old hat.
Why would you go there?

01:47:26.095 --> 01:47:29.765
The guy I'm marrying lives there.

01:47:32.643 --> 01:47:34.228
You're getting married?

01:47:35.980 --> 01:47:37.398
Yeah.

01:47:37.481 --> 01:47:39.650
Saturday, in Malibu.

01:47:39.733 --> 01:47:43.362
His name is Eric Lamonsoff.
He's not in show business.

01:47:43.445 --> 01:47:45.864
He owns a chain of coffee stores.

01:47:45.948 --> 01:47:49.493
A store that just sells coffee?
I don't know.

01:47:49.576 --> 01:47:51.620
That ain't gonna work, kid.

01:47:52.454 --> 01:47:55.457
I just need a... a break from the music.

01:47:56.042 --> 01:47:59.921
But singing's the only thing
that makes you happy.

01:48:00.004 --> 01:48:03.257
Yeah, but I'm looking for something else
to make me happy.

01:48:05.384 --> 01:48:06.802
'Cause that's not it anymore.

01:48:10.139 --> 01:48:13.684
Miss Clarke, I'm so sorry to bother you,
but would you?

01:48:13.767 --> 01:48:15.019
Sure.

01:48:15.102 --> 01:48:17.813
Is that the record? Can you play it?

01:48:17.896 --> 01:48:19.941
- Is there a player in the room?
- Yeah.

01:48:20.983 --> 01:48:22.859
I gotta hear this.

01:48:29.741 --> 01:48:31.618
You were always there for me.

01:48:34.330 --> 01:48:35.664
Even when you weren't.

01:48:44.506 --> 01:48:45.882

Alfred?

01:50:17.141 --> 01:50:19.893
Wow. Nobody's called me that in years.

01:50:20.894 --> 01:50:22.229
Good to see you, Sandy.

01:50:22.313 --> 01:50:24.981
Hey, what are you doing here?

01:50:25.066 --> 01:50:27.526
Well, this is where
I get all my best ideas.

01:50:27.609 --> 01:50:29.027
Well, here and the radio.

01:50:29.111 --> 01:50:31.822
Yeah, you... you've been on such a roll.

01:50:31.905 --> 01:50:35.742
From "My Bologna"
to "Pretty Fly for a Rabbi."

01:50:35.826 --> 01:50:37.869
Just great. Clever stuff.

01:50:37.953 --> 01:50:40.640
Oh, thanks, man. Well, you know,
you're the one who put it all together.

01:50:40.664 --> 01:50:42.624
Remember what you told me?

01:50:42.708 --> 01:50:44.168
- Stick with the accordion.
- Uh-huh.

01:50:44.251 --> 01:50:46.170
Only wear Hawaiian shirts.

01:50:46.253 --> 01:50:48.922
Do funny words to other people's songs.

01:50:49.005 --> 01:50:50.299
- Genius.
- Huh?

01:50:50.382 --> 01:50:54.511
I'm glad. I'm glad it all worked out
for you. I really am. Sincerely.

01:50:54.595 --> 01:50:58.390
Thank you, man. Well, I'm just sorry
that we couldn't have done it together.

01:50:58.974 --> 01:51:00.892
Hey, listen. I got too close.

01:51:00.976 --> 01:51:03.645
Our friendship was getting
in the way of our business.

01:51:03.729 --> 01:51:05.606
You did what you had to do.

01:51:05.689 --> 01:51:08.734
Wait a minute.
Is that what you think happened?

01:51:08.817 --> 01:51:10.068
That is what happened.

01:51:10.152 --> 01:51:12.821
- You thought we got too close?
- Yeah.

01:51:12.904 --> 01:51:15.532
- No, Sandy.
- That's not why I left you.

01:51:15.616 --> 01:51:18.952
I left you because you
could never tell me the truth.

01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:21.247
What? That's ridiculous!

01:51:21.330 --> 01:51:23.915
Tell me one time
I didn't tell you the truth.

01:51:25.334 --> 01:51:27.961
You told me we could copyright
the word "weird."

01:51:28.044 --> 01:51:31.757
No, I said it was weird
that we couldn't copyright it.

01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:34.551
You... Come on. You were hearing
what you want to hear.

01:51:34.635 --> 01:51:36.970
Sandy, you tell people
what you think they want to hear.

01:51:37.053 --> 01:51:39.556
- I don't agree.
- No, look.

01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:45.437
For me, if you really care about someone,
you tell 'em the truth.

01:51:54.530 --> 01:51:55.947
You're right, Alfred.

01:51:57.408 --> 01:51:59.326
Damn it, you're 100% right.

01:52:00.869 --> 01:52:03.872
- Your hair looks good, by the way.
- Thanks, man, I...

01:52:04.748 --> 01:52:08.210
- You're lying again.
- I am. It looks like dirty spaghetti.

01:52:08.294 --> 01:52:10.962
I gotta stop. I'm gonna stop!

01:52:11.046 --> 01:52:12.923
- I'm gonna stop, Alfred.
- You should.

01:52:17.303 --> 01:52:20.514
Hey! Hey! You suck!

01:52:20.597 --> 01:52:23.184
You know what?
Real funny, Weird Al.

01:52:23.267 --> 01:52:27.271
Why don't you make me laugh one time
without using somebody else's music?

01:52:27.354 --> 01:52:28.480
Get off of me.

01:52:29.731 --> 01:52:33.068
I'd like to book a space
for a private event.

01:52:33.151 --> 01:52:37.614
No! No! Don't tell me it's impossible!
Everything's negotiable!

01:52:43.204 --> 01:52:46.415
Put it on your calendar, Ted.
Okay? Don't be late.

01:52:46.498 --> 01:52:47.958
I think we'll be busy.

01:52:48.041 --> 01:52:49.335
- I'm not talking to you.
- Hey!

01:52:49.418 --> 01:52:50.544
I'm talking to Ted!

01:52:50.627 --> 01:52:52.838
- Okay. We'll be there.
- What's his problem?

01:52:52.921 --> 01:52:54.673
I don't know. Just do what he says.

01:53:04.266 --> 01:53:07.686
It's an international call,
so talk fast, okay?

01:53:08.437 --> 01:53:09.646
Can I count on you?

01:53:10.689 --> 01:53:11.690
Perfect.

01:53:11.773 --> 01:53:13.609
And you have a valid driver's license?

01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:19.531
How am I looking?

01:53:19.615 --> 01:53:21.074
You actually look good, Sandy.

01:53:21.157 --> 01:53:22.659
That surprises you?

01:53:27.163 --> 01:53:29.791
- Courtney, your limo is here.
- It's showtime, girl.

01:53:29.875 --> 01:53:32.419
Wow. Um, it's early.
I'll be right down, guys.

01:53:42.971 --> 01:53:45.266
It's a big day, Miss Courtney Clarke.

01:53:46.182 --> 01:53:47.518
The biggest.

01:53:47.601 --> 01:53:50.228
- You look very beautiful.
- Thanks.

01:53:50.312 --> 01:53:51.647
How is traffic out there?

01:53:51.730 --> 01:53:55.066
Traffic's not a problem.
You sit back, relax.

01:53:58.362 --> 01:54:00.322
Let Firuz take good care of you.

01:54:04.826 --> 01:54:07.203
Sir, I think you missed our turn.

01:54:07.288 --> 01:54:08.664
No, no, no, no.

01:54:08.747 --> 01:54:10.791
That was a thing that on purpose I did.

01:54:11.458 --> 01:54:13.835
We're going shortcut.

01:54:32.646 --> 01:54:34.440
What are we doing here?

01:54:34.523 --> 01:54:36.817
Please, miss, go inside.

01:54:37.776 --> 01:54:39.445
I'm going inside to call the police.

01:55:16.272 --> 01:55:17.316
Sandy?

01:55:18.359 --> 01:55:21.403
Just you and me
under the stars again, kid.

01:55:21.487 --> 01:55:25.240
- Yeah, but now's not exactly a good time.
- I know.

01:55:25.324 --> 01:55:30.412
And I have no right to say to you what
I'm gonna say, but I'm gonna do it anyway.

01:55:31.788 --> 01:55:34.416
You like making trouble,
don't you, Sandy?

01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:36.627
Look, here's the thing.

01:55:36.710 --> 01:55:41.673
Maybe sometimes I got a way of telling
people what I think they want to hear,

01:55:41.757 --> 01:55:44.635
rather than what I'm really thinking.

01:55:44.718 --> 01:55:48.889
So I was thinking, if I started
saying the stuff that I think,

01:55:49.598 --> 01:55:53.268
maybe I'm gonna find out that's actually
what the people wanted to hear.

01:55:54.019 --> 01:55:56.146
Oh, shit, Sandy.
You mixed up your pills.

01:55:56.813 --> 01:56:00.817
What I'm trying to say is
this Eric Lamonsoff guy is wrong for you.

01:56:00.901 --> 01:56:05.071
Just like Bling was the wrong guy
and Lenny Kravitz.

01:56:05.155 --> 01:56:09.743
Marc Anthony. And Prince.
And Apollonia.

01:56:10.326 --> 01:56:13.329
Dennis Rodman,
who's great on the boards, but...

01:56:13.414 --> 01:56:15.582
You dated Dennis Rodman?
Good Lord.

01:56:16.625 --> 01:56:18.043
Dad, what are you doing here?

01:56:18.126 --> 01:56:20.295
Sandy's gettin' to that part.
You just listen.

01:56:20.379 --> 01:56:22.005
Yeah, thank you, Willy.

01:56:22.714 --> 01:56:24.215
All right, here's the deal.

01:56:25.426 --> 01:56:28.929
All those guys were chasing you
because you're incredible.

01:56:29.012 --> 01:56:32.098
But none of them really know who you are.

01:56:33.517 --> 01:56:34.893
Who am I, Sandy?

01:56:34.976 --> 01:56:37.020
You're Courtney Clarke.

01:56:38.104 --> 01:56:40.566
The beautiful swan from Magic Mountain.

01:56:41.567 --> 01:56:43.694
Now, I wouldn't tell you to break a deal

01:56:43.777 --> 01:56:47.197
unless I thought there was
a better offer out there for you.

01:56:47.864 --> 01:56:50.492
- Is there a better offer?
- Oh, absolutely.

01:56:50.576 --> 01:56:52.994
There's an aggressive offer out there.

01:56:53.078 --> 01:56:59.125
There's a guy who's willing to be devoted
to you 100% for your entire life.

01:56:59.209 --> 01:57:03.296
A guy who will make all the tough
phone calls, fight all the big fights.

01:57:03.379 --> 01:57:05.841
A guy who will never doubt you.

01:57:05.924 --> 01:57:07.801
Even when you doubt yourself.

01:57:08.677 --> 01:57:09.678
Keep going.

01:57:09.761 --> 01:57:14.683
He has surprisingly muscular quads
due to the ThighMaster.

01:57:16.351 --> 01:57:18.311
But what does this guy want in return?

01:57:18.394 --> 01:57:21.314
All he wants in return
is for you to be you,

01:57:21.397 --> 01:57:25.318
just the way you are,
because he loves you.

01:57:26.528 --> 01:57:27.654
I love you.

01:57:29.823 --> 01:57:31.658
I've always loved you.

01:57:33.702 --> 01:57:35.496
You're my star, Courtney.

01:57:36.955 --> 01:57:39.040
I love you, too, Sandy.

01:57:40.626 --> 01:57:43.169
I should have told you the truth
so long ago.

01:57:43.253 --> 01:57:46.172
Listen, I dye my hair.

01:57:46.882 --> 01:57:49.843
And I also apologize to my clothes
if I don't wear 'em enough.

01:57:49.926 --> 01:57:51.803
- No more truth.
- Absolutely.

01:57:51.887 --> 01:57:53.346
Just kiss me.

01:57:54.473 --> 01:57:57.643
Save that kiss. I came
all the way down here for a wedding.

01:57:57.726 --> 01:58:00.311
- Let's get to it.
- Yeah, let's not get him mad.

01:58:00.395 --> 01:58:01.730
Yeah, you're right.

01:58:02.898 --> 01:58:06.777
Boom Boom is ordained
as an interdenominational minister.

01:58:06.860 --> 01:58:08.695
Or we also have...

01:58:09.445 --> 01:58:11.406
Hey. Shalom.

01:58:12.115 --> 01:58:13.366
There he is.

01:58:13.449 --> 01:58:15.118
What do you say, kid?

01:58:16.077 --> 01:58:17.453
Will you marry me?

01:58:17.538 --> 01:58:19.372
You had me at "shalom."

01:58:21.542 --> 01:58:26.171
♪ I prefer you to remain a Christian ♪

01:58:26.254 --> 01:58:29.382
No, no, no. That's fine.
Either way, I'm good.

01:58:35.806 --> 01:58:39.518
Meanwhile, Eric Lamonsoff
was across town waiting at the altar.

01:58:39.601 --> 01:58:40.745
And don't feel sorry for him.

01:58:40.769 --> 01:58:42.688
That whole coffee thing
worked out just great.

01:58:42.771 --> 01:58:45.941
Plus, he ended up marrying
Downtown Julie Brown.

01:58:46.024 --> 01:58:47.025
- Honey?
- What?

01:58:47.108 --> 01:58:49.253
- You got a little schmutz, right there.
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:58:49.277 --> 01:58:50.821
Something had clicked with Sandy.

01:58:50.904 --> 01:58:54.700
And he started reaching out
one by one to his old clients.

01:58:54.783 --> 01:58:56.663
And because he started
telling them the truth...

01:58:57.160 --> 01:58:59.204
most of them ended up
having pretty big careers.

01:58:59.287 --> 01:59:00.956
- I signed with him.
- I signed with him.

01:59:01.039 --> 01:59:03.416
- I signed with him.
- We signed with him.

01:59:03.499 --> 01:59:06.211
And of course, I went back to Sandy.

01:59:06.294 --> 01:59:08.547
He's my manager and my best friend again.

01:59:08.630 --> 01:59:12.300
Too bad a wedding officiated
by a puppet was not legal.

01:59:12.383 --> 01:59:16.221
Which is why, 20 years later,
they're finally making it real.

01:59:16.304 --> 01:59:19.600
- There he is!
- Yeah! How y'all doing?

01:59:25.606 --> 01:59:28.567
Show business wealth is good,
but it's not real wealth.

01:59:28.650 --> 01:59:30.569
- It's not...
- Hey, shot, man?

01:59:30.652 --> 01:59:32.589
- Let's do a shot? Oh, all right.
- I'm good. I'm good.

01:59:32.613 --> 01:59:36.032
- Hey!
- Oh, my God! Hi!

01:59:37.367 --> 01:59:38.368
I'm sorry, what?

01:59:39.828 --> 01:59:42.538
I'm sorry, man.
I can't understand a word you're saying.

01:59:42.623 --> 01:59:44.249
No, seriously, I got nothing.

01:59:49.963 --> 01:59:53.549
All right. Hello. Hello. Hello.
Hi, guys.

01:59:53.634 --> 01:59:54.968
Oh, thank you, Sandy.

01:59:55.051 --> 01:59:57.531
All these years in the business,
he's got me working a wedding.

01:59:57.596 --> 02:00:01.057
This is fantastic. He booked me
in a tent, really is what it is.

02:00:01.850 --> 02:00:04.686
Said if I do good here,
I get a yurt next year.

02:00:07.355 --> 02:00:10.441
No, um... that was, uh,
some ceremony, too.

02:00:10.525 --> 02:00:12.962
It was a... It was a little awkward,
the priest and the rabbi together.

02:00:12.986 --> 02:00:14.029
That's always a...

02:00:14.112 --> 02:00:16.740
The rabbi, he was, like, Googling,
"Who's Jesus Christ?"

02:00:16.823 --> 02:00:17.908
But that's okay.

02:00:19.785 --> 02:00:21.411
Uh, what else is going on?

02:00:21.494 --> 02:00:24.665
- Just bring out the couple already.
- Yeah, quit doing your act.

02:00:24.748 --> 02:00:26.332
You're right. Okay.

02:00:26.416 --> 02:00:32.463

02:03:42.028 --> 02:03:43.864
Yeah, I want to represent him."

02:03:43.947 --> 02:03:46.532
He didn't understand
that that's a cartoon character.

02:03:46.616 --> 02:03:49.410
You can't really manage
a cartoon character.

02:03:49.494 --> 02:03:52.038
And, uh, he did give me his number though,

02:03:52.122 --> 02:03:55.083
and, uh, we used to call him
in the middle of the night.

02:03:58.753 --> 02:04:00.505
Wexler Artists.

02:04:00.588 --> 02:04:03.091
Is this Sandy?

02:04:03.174 --> 02:04:05.760
Yeah. Yeah, who... who is this?

02:04:05.844 --> 02:04:07.595
You know who this is.

02:04:07.678 --> 02:04:10.265
No, I don't. That's why I'm asking.

02:04:10.348 --> 02:04:12.642
Guess.

02:04:12.725 --> 02:04:14.685
Are you Gary Busey?

02:04:14.769 --> 02:04:17.397
No way! Dumbass.

02:04:17.480 --> 02:04:19.565
Who? Beavis?

02:04:20.316 --> 02:04:23.694
- You suck!
- What? No, I don't.

02:04:23.778 --> 02:04:24.946
You suck balls.

02:04:25.030 --> 02:04:26.739
No, no, no, no.

02:04:26.822 --> 02:04:28.366
You don't sound so good.

02:04:28.449 --> 02:04:31.494
Now, tell me where you are
and I'll pick you up.

02:04:31.577 --> 02:04:33.163
I'm in your butt.

02:04:33.246 --> 02:04:35.456
What? What's this?

02:04:35.540 --> 02:04:38.501
Yeah, I'm in there right now.

02:04:38.584 --> 02:04:39.752
Hemorrhoids.

02:04:39.835 --> 02:04:43.714
Wait. You get out of my butt.
Get out right now.

02:04:43.798 --> 02:04:45.216
Kill yourself.

02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:48.929
Okay. Okay, that's it.
I'm hanging up the phone.

02:04:51.973 --> 02:04:53.808
Wexler Artists.

02:04:53.892 --> 02:04:55.894
Uh... Sandy Wexler?

02:04:57.020 --> 02:04:58.104
Who is this?

02:04:58.188 --> 02:05:00.773
Uh, this is Butt-Head.

02:05:00.856 --> 02:05:03.568
Oh, hi, Butt-Head.

02:05:03.651 --> 02:05:07.197
Uh, Sandy,
I'm calling about Beavis.

02:05:07.280 --> 02:05:11.534
Uh, yeah. Beavis wasn't
too courteous last night, Butt-Head.

02:05:11.617 --> 02:05:13.828
Uh, that's why I'm calling.

02:05:13.912 --> 02:05:14.913
Uh-huh.

02:05:14.996 --> 02:05:17.290
Uh, Beavis wanted
to say he's sorry.

02:05:17.373 --> 02:05:20.710
Oh, okay. He is, huh?
He... he's sorry?

02:05:20.793 --> 02:05:23.922
Yeah. Beavis says
he's sorry you're such a dumb-ass.

02:05:24.005 --> 02:05:26.967
What? What's that?
What? What'd you say?

02:05:27.050 --> 02:05:29.052
Uh, and he's also sorry

02:05:29.135 --> 02:05:33.681
that he said your face looks like a toilet
and your balls smell funny.

02:05:34.349 --> 02:05:37.560
Okay, okay.
Well, you tell him I accept.

02:05:37.643 --> 02:05:40.813
Look, you're good kids,
and I like what you're doing.

02:05:40.896 --> 02:05:44.525
I think if you want to get
to the next level, you're gonna...

02:05:44.609 --> 02:05:47.028
- Uh, hang on a second.
- Okay.

02:05:47.112 --> 02:05:48.821
Beavis wants to say something, sir.

02:05:48.904 --> 02:05:51.657
- Oh, okay.
- Hey, this is Beavis.

02:05:51.741 --> 02:05:53.701
Uh... oh, hi, Beavis.

02:05:54.910 --> 02:05:56.912
- Sandy Wexler?
- Yeah.

02:05:56.997 --> 02:05:59.457
Sandy Wexler?

02:05:59.540 --> 02:06:03.461
- Yeah, I know my name.
- Of Wexler Fartists?

02:06:03.544 --> 02:06:06.422
All right. Okay, come on, guys.

02:06:06.506 --> 02:06:10.385
Uh...
You said you wanna come on guys?

02:06:12.053 --> 02:06:13.554
That's it. I'm getting off.

02:06:13.638 --> 02:06:17.100
You said you're getting off.

02:06:17.183 --> 02:06:19.935
All right.
Listen, you sons of bitches.

02:06:20.020 --> 02:06:21.312
I'll find your parents

02:06:21.396 --> 02:06:25.066
and make you wish you never messed
with the king of Hollywood.

02:06:25.150 --> 02:06:26.901
You said "wood."

02:06:26.985 --> 02:06:29.279
All right. Come on!

02:06:30.405 --> 02:06:31.572
Stop it!

- All right, good.

02:06:34.534 --> 02:06:36.536
Yeah!
