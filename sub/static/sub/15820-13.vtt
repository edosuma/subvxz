00:21.187 --> 00:22.747
What's the deal with this music?

00:22.787 --> 00:25.823
You know uniforms aren't
gonna touch anything.

00:31.788 --> 00:32.988
Is that a rat?

00:33.888 --> 00:36.198
That's his hair replacement system.

00:36.288 --> 00:37.160
His what?

00:37.195 --> 00:38.948
They used to call it a toupee?

00:38.988 --> 00:41.958
Yeah, well, they used
to call them bald, too.

00:42.389 --> 00:44.303
Huh. This water is still hot.

00:44.389 --> 00:46.489
This bottle's half empty.

00:47.289 --> 00:49.863
This guy got drunk and cooked to death.

00:50.289 --> 00:51.221
Help me up.

00:51.256 --> 00:52.949
Who are you to be givin' me orders?

00:52.989 --> 00:54.837
Senior officer at the scene.

00:55.589 --> 00:56.711
Lieutenant Flynn,

00:57.390 --> 00:59.990
see if this bottle has any prints on it

01:00.090 --> 01:05.090
other than the ones belongin' to
our big-time Hollywood producer here.

01:05.390 --> 01:06.590
Thank yew!

01:06.690 --> 01:08.390
Ha ha ha ha!

01:08.490 --> 01:09.490
Yoohoo!

01:09.590 --> 01:10.891
Detective Sanchez!

01:10.991 --> 01:12.791
Yoohoo! Uh,

01:12.991 --> 01:17.991
would you ask S. I. D to come
down here for one little second?

01:18.091 --> 01:19.873
Oh, and, detective Daniels,

01:19.891 --> 01:22.551
I want to talk to the
neighbor who called this in.

01:22.591 --> 01:24.307
Thank you. Lieutenant Tao,

01:24.392 --> 01:25.492
grab your abacas

01:25.592 --> 01:29.024
and see if y'all can't
figure out the time of death.

01:31.392 --> 01:33.392
Thank yew, lieutenant.

01:34.292 --> 01:36.492
Those are all excellent ideas.

01:47.093 --> 01:49.007
Neighbor reported loud music.

01:49.093 --> 01:51.153
Local division sent some officers by.

01:51.193 --> 01:55.153
Found Mr Pruitt here checkin'
out the bottom of his jacuzzi.

01:56.094 --> 01:58.954
I understand your
neighbor was botherin' you?

01:58.994 --> 02:00.710
Since the day he moved in.

02:00.894 --> 02:02.654
Wife and son are
staying at her parents'.

02:02.694 --> 02:04.654
They've been there since yesterday.

02:04.694 --> 02:06.255
Look, I keep to myself, but they don't.

02:06.295 --> 02:08.955
It is one screaming argument
after another over here.

02:08.995 --> 02:11.995
These Hollywood types… class-less.

02:12.195 --> 02:15.355
He did it on purpose, too… Chased off
his wife so his girlfriend could come over.

02:15.395 --> 02:19.155
Then he'd chase off his girlfriend
so some hooker could come over.

02:19.195 --> 02:20.955
Did you hear anything like that tonight?

02:20.995 --> 02:23.216
No. Just the outrageously loud music,

02:23.256 --> 02:27.480
which, in my experience, means
he's miserable, drunk, and alone.

02:27.495 --> 02:29.195
So… he's really dead?

02:29.595 --> 02:31.495
Yes. I'm so sorry.

02:32.595 --> 02:34.773
Will this affect property values?

02:38.896 --> 02:40.942
Seems like regular old tequila.

02:41.196 --> 02:42.384
It's not uncommon.

02:42.596 --> 02:43.322
Guy drinks,

02:43.696 --> 02:44.756
passes out in the hot tub.

02:44.796 --> 02:46.578
His body temperature rises…

02:46.996 --> 02:48.697
and his liver explodes.

02:48.797 --> 02:50.909
But this robe… it's soakin' wet.

02:52.997 --> 02:53.897
Chlorine.

02:53.997 --> 02:55.857
It's been in and out
of the water recently.

02:55.897 --> 02:56.857
The whole thing.

02:56.897 --> 02:58.857
And I doubt it climbed out on its own.

02:58.897 --> 03:01.358
Lieutenant Tao, could you
follow up on this, please?

03:01.398 --> 03:03.958
Detective Sanchez, I'm gonna want
to visit with the wife tomorrow.

03:03.998 --> 03:05.758
I think it's odd she's not around.

03:05.798 --> 03:06.854
I want an alibi.

03:06.998 --> 03:07.858
Detective Daniels,

03:07.898 --> 03:10.758
this portable CD player
seems to have raised the roof.

03:10.798 --> 03:12.358
Let's rush some prints on it.

03:12.398 --> 03:15.659
Lieutenant Flynn, could you do
the honors at the morgue, please?

03:15.699 --> 03:16.999
Wake someone?

03:17.299 --> 03:19.299
And, lieutenant Provenza…

03:19.399 --> 03:20.199
Yes, ma'am.

03:20.234 --> 03:24.699
I need this hurried to S. I. D…
in about 2 shakes of a lamb's tail.

03:25.999 --> 03:27.799
Thank you so very much.

03:28.799 --> 03:31.460
And keep it taped off,
ladies and gentlemen.

03:31.500 --> 03:34.272
Because until we
understand things better…

03:36.200 --> 03:38.625
Uh, this is a crime scene, y'all.

04:07.579 --> 04:08.635
What time is it?

04:08.679 --> 04:09.480
10 to 8:00.

04:09.780 --> 04:11.280
Oh, my lord!

04:11.380 --> 04:12.941
Why'd you let me sleep so late?

04:12.981 --> 04:13.941
I was makin' breakfast.

04:13.981 --> 04:17.142
Thought you might want
more 'n one hour of sleep.

04:17.182 --> 04:18.283
I made waffles.

04:19.283 --> 04:20.668
I have a waffle iron?

04:21.884 --> 04:24.145
Hey, by the way, your
mom called last night.

04:24.185 --> 04:25.571
Right after you left.

04:25.785 --> 04:26.886
She called here?

04:27.086 --> 04:29.147
She's a nice lady. Great sense of humor.

04:29.187 --> 04:31.247
You answered the phone? Oh, my lord!

04:31.287 --> 04:32.277
What'd you say?

04:32.288 --> 04:33.288
I'm kidding.

04:33.688 --> 04:36.349
I just heard her leave
a message on the machine.

04:36.389 --> 04:37.650
Don't scare me like that.

04:37.690 --> 04:38.950
I didn't mean to scare you.

04:38.990 --> 04:39.950
Thought I was bein' funny.

04:39.990 --> 04:44.346
Just wanted to lighten the mood
before I told you the other thing.

04:44.392 --> 04:45.514
What other thing?

04:45.993 --> 04:49.029
About some calls we got
at the FBI last night.

04:49.794 --> 04:50.794
Look. First…

04:51.395 --> 04:52.504
have a waffle.

04:55.496 --> 04:56.684
That enough syrup?

04:58.997 --> 05:00.998
–More syrup… please.
–Ok.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.072
Got a minute?

05:09.301 --> 05:10.261
Wanna show you something.

05:10.301 --> 05:13.562
This, uh… came up to my office
from internal affairs last night.

05:13.602 --> 05:14.303
Late.

05:15.303 --> 05:16.161
After I left.

05:18.304 --> 05:21.736
An anonymous complaint
against deputy chief Johnson.

05:22.706 --> 05:24.818
“Conduct unbecoming an officer.”

05:25.006 --> 05:25.985
Man.

05:27.307 --> 05:31.669
The charges which come from somebody in the
LAPD aren't related to her effectiveness,

05:31.709 --> 05:34.810
but how she's treated
the DA. and the FBI.

05:36.010 --> 05:38.271
If she really can't be reduced in rank,

05:38.311 --> 05:41.472
this might give the law enforcement
community an opportunity to…

05:41.512 --> 05:44.548
An I. A. investigation
into conduct unbecoming

05:45.014 --> 05:46.974
is not a note in the
complaint box, Taylor.

05:47.014 --> 05:47.875
It's a serious charge.

05:47.915 --> 05:49.575
It could end up taking
Brenda off the force,

05:49.615 --> 05:53.707
smearing her reputation, in
addition to blowing up in my face.

05:53.817 --> 05:55.777
And I would appreciate it very much

05:55.817 --> 05:57.533
if this somehow went away.

05:59.619 --> 06:01.929
That's going to be difficult to do.

06:02.520 --> 06:05.281
I mean, it's unethical
to even question people

06:05.321 --> 06:07.582
about whether they made an anonymous…

06:07.622 --> 06:08.422
Complaint.

06:11.023 --> 06:11.937
Right.

06:13.424 --> 06:15.536
I think you're right about that.

06:18.225 --> 06:19.226
Right. Well…

06:21.226 --> 06:24.592
then I guess I'm obligated
to review these charges.

06:28.729 --> 06:30.090
Correct me if I'm wrong,

06:30.130 --> 06:35.431
but isn't it also an ethical violation
to contact potential witnesses

06:35.531 --> 06:39.227
in an internal affairs
investigation and, uh, brief 'em…

06:39.233 --> 06:41.033
Coach 'em… stuff like that?

06:41.434 --> 06:45.262
That could trigger an I. A.
investigation, too, I believe.

06:45.535 --> 06:47.936
I believe that's so… sir.

06:48.436 --> 06:49.636
I know that's so.

06:52.437 --> 06:56.133
I sure do hope I don't find
that's what's been going on.

07:00.140 --> 07:02.901
So, our potential victim
had a bit of a record.

07:02.941 --> 07:06.302
Smacked his wife around a couple
times… that we know about.

07:06.342 --> 07:07.903
She refused to press charges.

07:07.943 --> 07:13.245
Also, he was arrested 5 times
for DU. I., 4 of which went away.

07:13.345 --> 07:16.446
Autopsy report. Had water in the lungs.

07:16.546 --> 07:18.647
So he didn't cook. He drowned.

07:18.747 --> 07:21.648
Had a blood alc of.16.

07:21.848 --> 07:22.813
Now…

07:22.848 --> 07:28.010
That might make your average bear susceptible
to passing out in a hot tub, but not a drunk.

07:28.050 --> 07:28.924
Jeez.

07:28.959 --> 07:30.111
If this guy was murdered,

07:30.151 --> 07:32.412
wouldn't you expect to see
some evidence of a struggle?

07:32.452 --> 07:36.613
The temperature of the water might've
cut down the visibility of bruisin'.

07:36.653 --> 07:38.814
We do have some abrasion on the heels.

07:38.854 --> 07:40.815
I think the toupee is
evidence of a struggle.

07:40.855 --> 07:43.155
Oh, baloney! How so?

07:43.456 --> 07:44.314
This is true.

07:44.356 --> 07:49.258
It's a Lee Quong, medium-density,
poly-mesh hair unit.

07:49.358 --> 07:53.120
It has a french lace front.
It is virtually undetectable.

07:53.159 --> 07:55.820
He stuck it on with
clips, then silicone glue.

07:55.860 --> 07:58.521
The temp in the hot tub wouldn't
have done anything to it.

07:58.561 --> 07:59.521
Then there's the robe.

07:59.561 --> 08:01.822
Trace evidence shows chlorine, bromide,

08:01.862 --> 08:05.123
and a few algaecides unique to the
samples we took from Pruitt's jacuzzi.

08:05.163 --> 08:08.124
I admit to being a little vague
on the subject of hot tubs,

08:08.164 --> 08:13.114
but don't people usually take off their
robes before they get in the water?

08:16.767 --> 08:19.829
So, the water saturation
level in the skin indicates

08:19.869 --> 08:21.829
he was in the hot tub for 3 hours.

08:21.869 --> 08:22.870
At 8:30,

08:23.270 --> 08:24.530
the neighbor… Mr Mitchell… calls

08:24.570 --> 08:28.031
and says the music from the
portable CD player's too loud.

08:28.071 --> 08:30.777
Uh, maybe someone
came into the backyard.

08:32.073 --> 08:36.534
Someone Pruitt knew. Uh, he didn't
get outta the tub, saw no reason to.

08:36.573 --> 08:39.635
Uh, someone turned up the
music on the CD player…

08:39.676 --> 08:43.537
Grabbed the robe, put it over his head,
and held him there till he drowned.

08:43.577 --> 08:46.481
Sounds a lot like angry
wife syndrome to me.

08:46.678 --> 08:51.232
Yeah, but she and her kid have been
at her parents' house for 2 days.

08:51.380 --> 08:53.180
Mr and Mrs Alonso Lopez.

08:53.280 --> 08:54.741
He's a concert pianist.

08:54.781 --> 08:57.342
I apologize for my
cultural shortcomings.

08:57.382 --> 09:00.143
Tell 'em I'm on my way
to talk to their daughter.

09:00.183 --> 09:00.883
Also,

09:00.983 --> 09:02.244
I heard somethin' about a girlfriend?

09:02.284 --> 09:04.544
Lieutenant Flynn, could
you check that out?

09:04.584 --> 09:08.046
And I'd like to have S. I. D rush
the prints on that CD player.

09:08.086 --> 09:10.446
Look into that, lieutenant Tao, please?

09:10.486 --> 09:13.247
Detective Daniels, that neighbor
seems like a bit of a know-it-all.

09:13.287 --> 09:14.748
I'd like to see him again.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.636
And, lieutenant Provenza, y…

09:17.589 --> 09:19.350
Ch… check out Mr Pruitt's street.

09:19.390 --> 09:22.651
See if anyone saw a visitor goin'
in or out of our victim's backyard.

09:22.691 --> 09:23.444
Thank you.

09:23.479 --> 09:26.713
Sergeant Gabriel, would
you come with me, please?

09:34.829 --> 09:36.786
Sergeant, just… just
one minute, please.

09:36.826 --> 09:37.785
Something personal.

09:37.825 --> 09:38.873
Excuse me.

09:38.908 --> 09:41.680
When were you going to tell me
about this anonymous complaint?

09:41.720 --> 09:42.681
Great.

09:42.819 --> 09:45.176
I was never going to tell
you about the complaint,

09:45.216 --> 09:48.780
because I'm going to find
some way to make it go away.

09:48.811 --> 09:50.065
Conduct unbecoming?

09:50.709 --> 09:52.366
What about my conduct is unbecoming?

09:52.406 --> 09:53.511
Nothing.

09:53.605 --> 09:55.462
Brenda, please, don't worry about it.

09:55.502 --> 09:57.260
If I can't get these charges withdrawn,

09:57.300 --> 10:00.556
I'll find some way to show that
they are completely without merit.

10:00.596 --> 10:02.254
And incidentally, just so you know,

10:02.294 --> 10:03.951
this is an attack on me, too,

10:03.991 --> 10:08.046
so have no doubts about how
vigorously I'm going to fight it, ok?

10:08.086 --> 10:10.084
So, just work your case.

10:11.482 --> 10:12.441
If I'm in trouble, Will,

10:12.481 --> 10:14.263
I deserve to know about it.

10:15.177 --> 10:16.247
I agree,

10:16.675 --> 10:17.995
but so far, this is…

10:20.570 --> 10:22.814
It's in my hands, and you're fine.

10:24.565 --> 10:26.445
Go solve your case.

10:37.119 --> 10:40.824
So, this is everyone who was
here last night, Mr Lopez?

10:41.325 --> 10:42.278
Yes.

10:42.327 --> 10:44.390
Mrs Pruitt, according
to your neighbors,

10:44.430 --> 10:47.695
you and your husband were quarreling
around the time you left your home.

10:47.735 --> 10:49.698
What exactly were you
guys arguing about?

10:49.738 --> 10:51.200
It… it doesn't matter anymore.

10:51.240 --> 10:52.494
I'm afraid it does.

10:54.745 --> 10:56.247
Oh, no, thank you.

10:56.347 --> 10:57.612
No, thank you.

10:57.647 --> 11:01.415
Police officers also responded to other
reports of domestic violence at your home.

11:01.455 --> 11:03.217
I mean, we have it on record.

11:03.257 --> 11:03.983
Amelia, no.

11:04.860 --> 11:05.864
Please.

11:06.262 --> 11:08.506
Yes, yes, they have argued before.

11:08.866 --> 11:10.128
Why is that your business?

11:10.168 --> 11:14.260
Because this last argument seems
to have been pretty physical.

11:14.674 --> 11:18.301
Mrs Pruitt, 2 days ago,
you took your 3-year-old son,

11:18.301 --> 11:20.250
you left your house,
and you came here.

11:20.290 --> 11:23.194
Was that the last time
you saw your husband?

11:23.687 --> 11:26.261
–Yes.
–I'll ask you the question again.

11:26.992 --> 11:28.840
What were you arguing about?

11:28.995 --> 11:30.117
I don't remember.

11:30.898 --> 11:34.363
Do you remember how you got those
bruises on your wrists and on your neck?

11:34.403 --> 11:35.565
–This is too upsetting.
–Ma'am,

11:35.605 --> 11:38.770
It's important that we determine the
whereabouts of your daughter last night.

11:38.810 --> 11:41.974
Amelia has never left this
house since she got here.

11:42.014 --> 11:43.977
She's devastated by Richard's death,

11:44.017 --> 11:46.882
and you are asking her all
these suspicious questions.

11:46.922 --> 11:48.638
Amelia was here all night.

11:48.824 --> 11:50.487
We all had dinner here together.

11:50.527 --> 11:51.626
And you are?

11:51.661 --> 11:53.091
–I'm Dennis.
–This is Dennis Burke,

11:53.131 --> 11:54.693
one of my master students.

11:54.733 --> 11:58.799
We asked him to stay and eat with us
after his lesson as we almost always do.

11:58.839 --> 11:59.801
It's my pleasure to hang.

11:59.841 --> 12:02.547
I almost never get
to see Amelia anymore.

12:04.147 --> 12:06.611
Look, have you even
proven there was a murder?

12:06.651 --> 12:08.961
We haven't been able to dismiss it.

12:10.056 --> 12:12.519
So, what time did you
eat dinner last night?

12:12.559 --> 12:13.661
At 7:00, Alonso?

12:14.462 --> 12:15.320
Right before.

12:15.964 --> 12:18.274
Is there anything else, Ms Johnson?

12:18.668 --> 12:21.242
We have a very hard day to get through.

12:21.272 --> 12:21.973
Of course.

12:22.975 --> 12:25.078
No, no. Thank you.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.698
Thank you very much.

12:38.462 --> 12:41.125
Well, I'd say the wife has
a pretty airtight alibi.

12:41.165 --> 12:43.475
You know who needs airtight alibis?

12:43.567 --> 12:45.193
Murderers.

12:51.194 --> 12:52.253
Let me emphasize this.

12:52.293 --> 12:56.152
The DA. 's office has no argument
with Ms Johnson's abilities.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.212
Right.

12:57.591 --> 13:00.849
She thinks pretty highly of
herself, but she's competent.

13:00.889 --> 13:03.648
Always glad to hear about competence
from the FBI, agent Jackson.

13:03.688 --> 13:08.486
It's her behavior, her manner,
her… her dismissive attitude.

13:08.586 --> 13:09.785
I agree with that.

13:09.885 --> 13:11.594
We made it clear to chief Johnson

13:11.634 --> 13:15.442
that there might be $2 million
moving into terrorists' hands,

13:15.482 --> 13:20.140
and she completely blew us off for a pretty
routine case of a wife murdering her husband.

13:20.180 --> 13:25.238
And she suggested that I'd made serious
errors in the prosecution of Bill Croelick.

13:25.278 --> 13:26.202
All right, so,

13:26.677 --> 13:28.836
if internal affairs were to contact you

13:28.876 --> 13:31.035
regarding deputy chief Johnson today,

13:31.075 --> 13:32.334
you would be inclined…

13:32.374 --> 13:35.872
She's bad at inter-agency relations.

13:36.272 --> 13:38.252
That's the gist of it, anyway.

13:39.471 --> 13:40.459
All right.

13:40.870 --> 13:45.688
Might you be open to another solution?
Because I have a proposal to make.

13:51.100 --> 13:53.608
I understand Mr
Pruitt's girlfriend's…

13:55.302 --> 13:56.762
Mr Pruitt's girlfriend's here?

13:56.802 --> 13:57.863
Uh, Dick's girlfriend.

13:57.903 --> 13:59.063
She called Mr Pruitt “Dick.”

13:59.103 --> 14:00.463
–All right.
–They were close.

14:00.503 --> 14:02.285
Her name is Sandra Decourt.

14:03.305 --> 14:04.505
Hmm hmm,

14:04.605 --> 14:08.506
the Drill Team was his
first film as a producer,

14:08.707 --> 14:11.267
and it never would've
gotten made without me.

14:11.307 --> 14:13.221
I set it up. I attached Dick.

14:13.508 --> 14:16.346
I bet she attached
Dick to a lot of things.

14:19.711 --> 14:22.212
When you say you attached Dick,

14:22.812 --> 14:24.772
I'm not sure I know what that means.

14:24.812 --> 14:26.513
Well, I had the idea,

14:27.313 --> 14:28.435
I got the writer,

14:29.214 --> 14:32.774
and I took Dick with me to the studio
with the first draft of the Drill Team,

14:32.814 --> 14:35.075
and they agreed to let him produce it.

14:35.115 --> 14:37.276
Was that the first time
that you met Mr Pruitt?

14:37.316 --> 14:38.016
Hmm hmm.

14:38.116 --> 14:39.817
I flipped for Dick.

14:40.317 --> 14:41.637
His attitude rocked,

14:43.018 --> 14:45.279
and I brought him in for a meeting.

14:45.319 --> 14:48.553
And I got Dick his
First-Look deal at the studio.

14:48.620 --> 14:50.534
So you guys all heard, right?

14:51.121 --> 14:52.882
About the, uh, I. A. investigation?

14:52.922 --> 14:54.572
What I. A. investigation?

14:54.923 --> 14:58.084
An anonymous complaint
against deputy chief Johnson.

14:58.124 --> 14:59.424
Conduct unbecoming.

14:59.524 --> 15:01.385
Anybody here know anything about that?

15:01.425 --> 15:04.686
–Did he appreciate all you'd done for him?
–Oh, you'd think so, right?

15:04.726 --> 15:06.787
I figured we had a good run, he and I.

15:06.827 --> 15:08.988
His next movie, “Patty's Pep Squad”,

15:09.028 --> 15:13.129
which was originally my idea,
it got a green light last week.

15:13.730 --> 15:16.891
And then he tells me, in
regards to my participation,

15:16.931 --> 15:20.297
the studio has decided to
go a different direction.

15:20.732 --> 15:25.034
So, where did Mr Pruitt tell
you that you'd been unattached?

15:25.534 --> 15:27.035
In a hot tub, maybe?

15:27.335 --> 15:28.635
Ok, you know what?

15:29.035 --> 15:30.636
It was partly my idea.

15:30.736 --> 15:32.122
I helped think it up,

15:32.136 --> 15:33.337
but I backed out,

15:33.737 --> 15:36.598
and I had no part in
submitting the complaint, none.

15:36.638 --> 15:39.476
Yeah, but you know who
did for sure, right?

15:39.639 --> 15:40.550
Yeah…

15:42.540 --> 15:44.241
And so do you, sergeant.

15:44.341 --> 15:46.602
 boyfriend. He was
a project I'd set up.

15:46.642 --> 15:48.160
And I am sorry he died.

15:49.943 --> 15:50.888
Really.

15:51.944 --> 15:53.792
But you don't have an alibi.

15:53.945 --> 15:56.717
God, if you want to
be exact about it, no.

15:56.846 --> 16:00.107
Look, what happened to Dick
doesn't have a twist at the end.

16:00.147 --> 16:01.647
Amelia did it.

16:02.648 --> 16:04.809
You know she did it. I know she did it.

16:04.849 --> 16:06.609
Her parents know she did it.

16:06.649 --> 16:08.310
She had every right to do it.

16:08.350 --> 16:11.111
In fact, I would have probably done
it myself if I was in love with him,

16:11.151 --> 16:13.131
but I wasn't in love with him.

16:17.453 --> 16:18.575
All right, chief.

16:19.154 --> 16:20.915
All right, I'm buying
this guy was murdered,

16:20.955 --> 16:22.539
but I just can't believe

16:22.555 --> 16:24.616
that he was done in
by his wife or this…

16:24.656 --> 16:25.537
this D-girl.

16:25.572 --> 16:26.517
What's her name, Sandy?

16:26.557 --> 16:27.679
What is a D-girl?

16:27.757 --> 16:30.210
D-girl. It's a
derogatory title for women

16:30.250 --> 16:32.019
who develop movie and T. V. scripts,

16:32.059 --> 16:34.219
and why is it you think
she couldn't have done it?

16:34.259 --> 16:36.720
Because a woman like Sandy
couldn't hold a big guy

16:36.760 --> 16:39.321
like Pruitt underwater
while he's drowning, Daniels.

16:39.361 --> 16:41.262
Really? Get up.

16:41.662 --> 16:42.654
What?

16:43.363 --> 16:45.343
–Come on. Come on.
–All right…

16:48.865 --> 16:50.779
Or should I just take it off?

16:50.866 --> 16:52.026
Oh, no, here we go.

16:52.066 --> 16:55.467
Just do what you're told
just this once and sit.

16:57.468 --> 17:01.069
Ah, now if only some fine-lookin' woman

17:01.169 --> 17:04.073
would come up behind
me and try to drown me.

17:09.071 --> 17:10.523
Wait a minute. Freeze.

17:15.575 --> 17:17.435
All right. Sanchez, sit back down.

17:17.474 --> 17:18.376
Come on.

17:18.976 --> 17:21.477
Uh, I got a bad feeling about this.

17:21.777 --> 17:22.569
Take it off.

17:23.678 --> 17:24.470
Start again.

17:29.980 --> 17:32.381
Ok! Ok! God!

17:33.481 --> 17:35.082
Ok! All right, damn it!

17:38.983 --> 17:40.284
Sorry. Ha ha ha.

17:40.384 --> 17:42.085
Your hair stayed on.

17:45.186 --> 17:46.346
Ah, let's do it again.

17:46.386 --> 17:47.574
Let's do it again.

17:47.787 --> 17:48.987
Not necessary.

17:49.087 --> 17:50.588
Thank you very much.

17:50.788 --> 17:53.949
All right, so the wife and
girlfriend are back on the list, yes?

17:53.989 --> 17:55.045
Yeah, uh, chief,

17:55.290 --> 17:56.150
neighbor's on the phone.

17:56.190 --> 17:57.150
You want to talk to him?

17:57.190 --> 17:58.391
No, thank you.

17:58.491 --> 18:00.801
I'd like to visit him at his house.

18:00.992 --> 18:01.946
Sergea…

18:02.592 --> 18:04.242
Where's sergeant Gabriel?

18:04.493 --> 18:05.493
Uh, he's busy.

18:07.094 --> 18:08.995
And… he's busy.

18:09.895 --> 18:11.017
I think he's, uh,

18:11.095 --> 18:13.933
getting the print
report on that CD player.

18:14.497 --> 18:15.457
I'll go with you.

18:15.497 --> 18:17.096
Oh, all right.

18:21.756 --> 18:25.363
David, I get that this
internal affairs investigation

18:25.463 --> 18:27.768
is going to be hard on your boss

18:27.968 --> 18:29.156
and on your squad,

18:29.572 --> 18:33.532
but there's really no reason
for you to get involved at all.

18:35.383 --> 18:38.990
Allow the system to handle
this anonymous complaint

18:39.792 --> 18:40.782
in its own way.

18:41.595 --> 18:42.958
Except this anonymous complaint,

18:42.998 --> 18:44.561
it's not that anonymous, sir.

18:44.601 --> 18:48.561
Len's already talked about it.
Everybody knows who filed it.

18:49.010 --> 18:51.916
Well, you know what you think you know.

18:52.116 --> 18:53.880
Well, let's suppose I don't.

18:53.920 --> 18:56.585
Let's suppose I have no specific
knowledge as to who filed the complaint.

18:56.625 --> 19:01.796
Suppose I were just to discuss the charge of
conduct unbecoming an officer on its merits,

19:01.836 --> 19:05.002
because internal affairs
is gonna ask me about it,

19:05.042 --> 19:06.505
and I'm gonna answer them.

19:06.545 --> 19:08.261
And your response will be?

19:10.753 --> 19:13.709
I'm going to tell them
that I've observed

19:14.390 --> 19:17.326
deputy chief Johnson on
every case that she's worked

19:17.366 --> 19:22.477
and that I think the charges
against her are small-minded,

19:22.978 --> 19:25.683
petty, and malicious

19:25.783 --> 19:29.591
and that I'm ashamed of
whoever may have filed them.

19:30.893 --> 19:33.005
That's what I'm gonna tell them.

19:38.308 --> 19:39.628
You feel better now?

19:41.414 --> 19:44.120
You feel righteous, all puffed-up?

19:44.220 --> 19:45.021
No, sir.

19:45.222 --> 19:46.938
I feel sick to my stomach.

19:48.328 --> 19:51.826
If you'll excuse me, I'm
investigating a murder, sir.

19:58.822 --> 20:02.650
I really don't pay that much
attention to their arguments,

20:02.721 --> 20:04.480
but it wasn't his wife
he was fighting with.

20:04.520 --> 20:05.972
It was his girlfriend.

20:06.020 --> 20:08.462
Oh, this is the night before he died.

20:09.019 --> 20:10.878
Did you hear anything specific?

20:10.918 --> 20:11.818
Not really.

20:11.918 --> 20:15.017
I mean, “F” this, “F” that, “F” you.

20:15.216 --> 20:18.582
Something about how hard
she'd worked on pep squad,

20:18.615 --> 20:20.331
and how could he dump her?

20:20.415 --> 20:22.614
And how he just used her,

20:22.714 --> 20:26.173
and then he told her she was
too expensive for what she did.

20:26.213 --> 20:27.929
Shame so much escaped you.

20:28.012 --> 20:30.916
Is this the F'ing
girlfriend that you heard?

20:31.611 --> 20:32.383
Yeah.

20:32.418 --> 20:34.210
She drives a silver BMW X5

20:34.310 --> 20:37.280
and parks it about 5
feet away from the curb.

20:37.509 --> 20:41.968
So, after that, the girlfriend left, the wife
stayed gone, and no one else came or went?

20:42.008 --> 20:43.724
Nope. Except the gardener.

20:48.105 --> 20:49.565
What time did you see him?

20:49.605 --> 20:54.663
I didn't, but his truck was still parked out
front when I walked the dog by around, uh…

20:54.703 --> 20:56.003
7:30.

20:56.403 --> 20:57.402
Excuse me.

21:02.101 --> 21:04.345
So, you both work for the Pruitts?

21:04.800 --> 21:05.828
Yes.

21:06.499 --> 21:10.327
And were you working at the
Pruitts' house 2 evenings ago?

21:12.697 --> 21:13.397
Yes.

21:15.296 --> 21:18.255
And did you climb mount
Everest in your undershorts?

21:18.295 --> 21:18.995
Yes.

21:21.494 --> 21:25.454
Maybe this would go a little
quicker if I handled it, chief.

21:25.993 --> 21:27.092
Ya think?

21:28.892 --> 21:29.791
Jes.

21:30.591 --> 21:31.591
Señor Pruitt…

21:32.890 --> 21:33.890
I speak German,

21:34.090 --> 21:36.349
russian, and am fully
conversant in czech,

21:36.389 --> 21:37.549
and I have to move to the one city

21:37.589 --> 21:40.559
where half the people
are from Latin America?

21:41.388 --> 21:43.047
He's asking them what specific problems

21:43.087 --> 21:44.737
they have with Mr Pruitt.

21:44.786 --> 21:45.974
You speak spanish?

21:45.986 --> 21:47.834
My stepfather's from Mexico.

21:48.385 --> 21:51.284
Pruitt was always yelling at them.

21:51.784 --> 21:54.622
He thinks they cut the
trees back too much.

21:56.782 --> 21:58.382
And last christmas,

21:58.582 --> 22:00.628
he didn't even give them a tip.

22:03.980 --> 22:05.498
 Jacobsons. In Westwood.

22:18.527 --> 22:19.324
Abogado.

22:20.220 --> 22:21.002
Yes.

22:21.017 --> 22:22.570
Did he just say, “avocado”?

22:22.610 --> 22:24.503
No. Abogado.

22:24.602 --> 22:25.658
What does that mean?

22:25.698 --> 22:27.533
Attorney.

22:34.232 --> 22:35.330
Just one second.

22:45.110 --> 22:46.867
All right, I think I've found a solution

22:46.907 --> 22:48.164
to your internal affairs problem,

22:48.204 --> 22:49.761
and I would love it if
you would just hear me out

22:49.801 --> 22:52.256
and not get all angry as
I go through the options.

22:52.296 --> 22:53.953
What happened to making it all go away?

22:53.993 --> 22:58.283
Just… just listen, ok, because
in essence, that's what I'm doing.

22:59.383 --> 23:00.880
You wanna sit down?

23:02.477 --> 23:06.371
Here's what could happen going
from worst scenario to best.

23:07.168 --> 23:10.022
Worst, you're given leave,
paid or unpaid, depending,

23:10.062 --> 23:14.114
while the charges against you are
investigated for up to 2 years.

23:14.154 --> 23:15.369
Next worst,

23:15.452 --> 23:17.348
you remain on duty here

23:17.847 --> 23:19.005
while you're being investigated

23:19.045 --> 23:22.398
and somebody from internal
affairs hounds you constantly.

23:22.438 --> 23:24.494
That, of course, could also take ages.

23:24.534 --> 23:28.786
Well, you've succeeded in scaring me enough
to listen to your last weaselly option.

23:28.826 --> 23:29.838
What is it?

23:30.024 --> 23:32.679
You took less time to
break up with me, I swear.

23:32.719 --> 23:34.475
You're not gonna believe
how simple this is.

23:34.515 --> 23:36.611
I invite Jackson from the FBI

23:36.711 --> 23:38.667
and deputy DA. Powell to my office,

23:38.707 --> 23:39.865
along with captain Taylor,

23:39.905 --> 23:42.759
whom we all know filed
this “anonymous” complaint.

23:42.799 --> 23:44.515
You just pop your head in,

23:44.995 --> 23:47.949
briefly apologize for not having
worked as well with everyone

23:47.989 --> 23:51.343
as you could have and promise
to do better in the future,

23:51.383 --> 23:52.503
and we're done.

23:52.780 --> 23:55.934
Taylor will see that if internal
affairs calls the FBI and the DA.,

23:55.974 --> 23:57.822
he's gonna look like an ass.

23:58.270 --> 24:01.372
We can get this outta
the way tomorrow morning.

24:06.454 --> 24:07.752
All right, then.

24:09.947 --> 24:11.069
I'll talk to 'em.

24:11.744 --> 24:12.842
Ok, and, uh,

24:13.241 --> 24:15.836
you think you know what to say?

24:16.036 --> 24:17.554
Yes, well, I'll get it.

24:18.631 --> 24:19.629
What time?

24:21.026 --> 24:22.224
8:45.

24:22.823 --> 24:23.879
All right, then.

24:24.120 --> 24:25.218
I'll be there.

24:27.015 --> 24:29.259
Thanks for working everything out.

24:32.504 --> 24:34.218
Ok. Thank you.

25:04.379 --> 25:05.441
Maid said to wait.

25:05.481 --> 25:08.319
I have waited 20
minutes. It's long enough.

25:31.066 --> 25:32.254
Pretty impressive.

25:33.667 --> 25:34.528
Thanks.

25:34.563 --> 25:36.939
Middle section was a little sketchy.

25:44.170 --> 25:47.131
–You're here a lot, aren't you?
–Just a second.

25:47.171 --> 25:49.572
There, there. That's sloppy.

25:50.872 --> 25:51.905
Excuse me.

25:52.373 --> 25:55.674
Um, I don't have a grand piano at home,

25:55.974 --> 25:57.934
and I have a competition
coming up in october,

25:57.974 --> 26:00.680
so when I can't
schedule a practice room,

26:00.775 --> 26:02.227
they let me play here.

26:04.276 --> 26:06.454
The Lopezes are wonderful people.

26:06.577 --> 26:08.038
I mean, Alonso's sort of a taskmaster.

26:08.078 --> 26:09.938
He doesn't like me to
leave here until I have it.

26:09.978 --> 26:12.816
Like the other night
when he kept you late?

26:14.480 --> 26:16.940
You guys are really
obvious, you know that?

26:16.980 --> 26:18.641
I stay for dinner almost
every time I'm here.

26:18.681 --> 26:21.842
He wasn't actually trying to
put together an alibi for Amelia.

26:21.882 --> 26:23.642
So y'all had dinner together?

26:23.682 --> 26:25.343
Well, Alonso never sits very long.

26:25.383 --> 26:26.643
He has a tour to practice for,

26:26.683 --> 26:28.444
so he pounded down some salad

26:28.484 --> 26:30.134
and then he came in here.

26:30.585 --> 26:32.345
So then it was just the 3 of you.

26:32.385 --> 26:33.486
Well, no.

26:33.886 --> 26:37.347
Mrs Lopez got up about halfway
through the meal to take Alonso a plate.

26:37.387 --> 26:40.027
I think she wanted me to talk to Amelia.

26:40.988 --> 26:43.089
We were close… friends,

26:43.189 --> 26:43.988
but, uh…

26:45.988 --> 26:47.149
I think she wasn't really in the mood.

26:47.189 --> 26:49.149
After a while, she went upstairs.

26:49.189 --> 26:51.150
And when did Ms Lopez come back?

26:51.190 --> 26:52.550
I don't know. A little while later.

26:52.590 --> 26:53.851
I read the paper for a bit.

26:53.891 --> 26:55.251
So how long were you alone, then?

26:55.291 --> 26:57.392
Like I said, I don't know.

26:57.892 --> 26:59.153
Mrs Lopez came back.

26:59.193 --> 27:01.293
We shared a piece of cake,

27:01.793 --> 27:03.154
and then she asked me to come in here

27:03.194 --> 27:05.254
and beg Alonso to join
us for coffee, at least,

27:05.294 --> 27:08.355
'cause I think the practicing was
getting on her nerves a little.

27:08.395 --> 27:10.256
Did she ask where Amelia had gone?

27:10.296 --> 27:11.957
Amelia hadn't gone anywhere.

27:11.997 --> 27:13.297
But she had,

27:13.397 --> 27:15.958
because her father was
in the next room playing,

27:15.998 --> 27:17.058
her mother went to join him,

27:17.098 --> 27:19.408
you were at the dinner table alone,

27:19.699 --> 27:21.019
so where was Amelia?

27:21.099 --> 27:22.485
Upstairs in her room.

27:23.200 --> 27:24.916
I went and checked on her.

27:25.301 --> 27:26.701
Amelia was exhausted.

27:27.001 --> 27:27.962
Now I'm afraid I'm going to have to

27:28.002 --> 27:29.562
ask you to leave my husband's studio.

27:29.602 --> 27:31.763
No one's allowed in here
except family and students.

27:31.803 --> 27:34.203
Mrs Lopez, we need to see Amelia.

27:34.304 --> 27:35.464
She's not available.

27:35.504 --> 27:37.765
I could have her brought down to
Parker center for an interview,

27:37.805 --> 27:39.965
but in light of what she's
been through, I'd rather not.

27:40.005 --> 27:41.466
The lawyer that we can provide for her

27:41.506 --> 27:43.967
will certainly advise
her to say nothing.

27:44.007 --> 27:45.167
I assure you, Ms Johnson,

27:45.207 --> 27:47.268
Alonso and I have the
will and the means,

27:47.308 --> 27:49.668
whatever it may take,
to protect our daughter.

27:49.708 --> 27:51.869
Ma'am no one's accused
your daughter of anything.

27:51.909 --> 27:52.909
Listen to me!

27:53.109 --> 27:55.023
The night Richard was killed,

27:55.110 --> 27:57.571
Amelia was in this
house with Alonso and me.

27:57.611 --> 28:01.072
And if you insist on coming
back here without our permission,

28:01.112 --> 28:04.573
I intend to report you to
your superiors for harassment.

28:04.613 --> 28:06.725
You might have to take a number.

28:17.416 --> 28:18.575
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

28:18.615 --> 28:20.046
I don't know, what are you thinking?

28:20.086 --> 28:22.480
I'm thinking that no one could've
gotten from here to Pruitt's house

28:22.520 --> 28:23.971
and back in under an hour.

28:24.011 --> 28:26.269
I mean, there were shows at
the Greek and Hollywood Bowl.

28:26.309 --> 28:28.568
It would've been bumper
to bumper for miles.

28:28.608 --> 28:29.767
Is that what you were thinking?

28:29.807 --> 28:32.183
No. I was thinking about the subway.

28:32.904 --> 28:33.704
Oh, yeah.

28:34.104 --> 28:35.160
We got a subway.

28:37.201 --> 28:39.160
I wonder if the timing would work.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.958
Never ridden the subway before.

28:40.998 --> 28:43.357
Something about going
underground in a city

28:43.397 --> 28:45.355
that shakes that freaks me out a bit.

28:45.395 --> 28:47.753
Sergeant, I need to ask you a question.

28:47.793 --> 28:48.696
Ok.

28:49.592 --> 28:51.506
Have I been a difficult boss?

28:52.690 --> 28:55.448
Have I offended you in
some way without knowing it?

28:55.488 --> 28:56.456
No.

28:56.487 --> 28:59.185
Well, at first, you know?

28:59.927 --> 29:02.842
I don't know, I guess
I've kind of gotten used to you.

29:02.882 --> 29:05.480
You did pay me a compliment once.

29:05.880 --> 29:06.817
Once?

29:06.852 --> 29:07.838
Yeah. Yeah, a couple weeks ago,

29:07.878 --> 29:09.577
you said, “good work”.

29:11.675 --> 29:14.573
Look, I know this is a mess now.

29:14.673 --> 29:15.708
But you…

29:15.872 --> 29:17.831
you'll find your way through it.

29:17.871 --> 29:19.124
Eventually.

29:19.869 --> 29:21.468
I know you will.

29:22.268 --> 29:23.667
I know you will.

29:30.062 --> 29:31.920
There's a red line
stop in North Hollywood

29:31.960 --> 29:34.219
that's under a mile
from the Lopez house.

29:34.259 --> 29:35.148
Convenient.

29:35.158 --> 29:36.717
Trains run every 20 minutes.

29:36.757 --> 29:38.715
What's the closest station
to the Pruitt house?

29:38.755 --> 29:40.214
There's 2: Hollywood and Vine,

29:40.254 --> 29:41.213
Hollywood and Western.

29:41.253 --> 29:43.512
What's the travel time between
the North Hollywood station

29:43.552 --> 29:45.011
and the one on Hollywood and Western?

29:45.051 --> 29:45.850
13 minutes.

29:46.050 --> 29:47.209
Yeah, but nobody's gonna walk

29:47.249 --> 29:50.606
from Hollywood and Western up
into the hills of Las Villas,

29:50.646 --> 29:52.605
take another 20 minutes to Pruitt's.

29:52.645 --> 29:53.804
Double it, there and back.

29:53.844 --> 29:56.642
Chief, remember the neighbors said

29:56.742 --> 30:00.199
that they saw a truck parked
outside of Pruitt's around 7:30.

30:00.239 --> 30:01.598
Thought it was the gardener.

30:01.638 --> 30:02.737
It's near dark.

30:02.837 --> 30:05.295
You see a ratty truck with
a leaf blower in the back,

30:05.335 --> 30:07.694
–and you just assume.
–You know who has ratty cars,

30:07.734 --> 30:09.792
and portable CD players,
and rides the subway?

30:09.832 --> 30:10.931
Music students.

30:11.331 --> 30:13.641
And this crime was carefully timed.

30:14.429 --> 30:16.687
This CD player didn't
have any prints on it.

30:16.727 --> 30:17.686
It was wiped clean.

30:17.726 --> 30:19.970
Maybe it was brought to the scene.

30:20.024 --> 30:23.082
Lieutenant Tao, let's drag the
L. A. metro security cameras.

30:23.122 --> 30:24.281
Detective Daniels, let's see

30:24.321 --> 30:27.879
if that so-called gardening truck
parked near any of our subway stations.

30:27.919 --> 30:29.833
It might have been impounded.

30:30.417 --> 30:31.394
Make some calls.

30:31.434 --> 30:32.548
Lieutenant Provenza…

30:32.588 --> 30:35.162
Flynn and I are gonna go back to Sandy.

30:35.313 --> 30:36.171
Why, exactly?

30:36.212 --> 30:37.400
Tie up loose ends.

30:39.210 --> 30:40.926
Her loose ends need tying.

30:44.706 --> 30:47.676
You two take the train
to and from both stops

30:47.704 --> 30:50.062
and have a car drive you to
and from the Pruitt house.

30:50.102 --> 30:50.961
Let's get this timed.

30:51.001 --> 30:51.801
Yes, ma'am.

30:52.600 --> 30:53.399
I…

30:54.699 --> 30:57.396
I just wanna say that

30:58.396 --> 31:00.654
there's been a complaint
lodged against me,

31:00.694 --> 31:03.664
an anonymous complaint
with internal affairs,

31:03.692 --> 31:04.951
and there's a meeting about it tomorrow,

31:04.991 --> 31:07.631
and I don't know what's going to happen.

31:11.886 --> 31:13.584
Interrogating people,

31:15.183 --> 31:16.569
getting to the truth,

31:17.082 --> 31:18.206
and, um,

31:19.080 --> 31:21.852
knowing the right
thing to do politically,

31:22.578 --> 31:24.558
are two very different things.

31:25.875 --> 31:27.834
In fact, to do either of them very well,

31:27.874 --> 31:30.632
you have to pretty much
ignore one of them altogether,

31:30.672 --> 31:32.256
which is what I've done.

31:32.570 --> 31:33.370
So, now,

31:33.470 --> 31:36.767
like through most of my life, my career,

31:37.766 --> 31:41.726
which is the best argument for
reincarnation I can think of…

31:43.162 --> 31:44.548
I'm in trouble again.

31:45.561 --> 31:46.553
And, um,

31:47.959 --> 31:48.881
I don't know

31:48.916 --> 31:51.424
if I'll even be here tomorrow evening.

31:53.155 --> 31:54.354
And if I'm not,

31:54.554 --> 31:55.478
I just wanted…

31:57.252 --> 31:58.251
to tell you all

31:58.751 --> 32:01.325
how much I've enjoyed working with you.

32:04.846 --> 32:05.945
Y'all are just…

32:06.845 --> 32:08.495
just really great people.

32:15.338 --> 32:16.238
Ok.

32:17.037 --> 32:19.413
I'll see y'all in the morning, then.

32:26.613 --> 32:27.614
Ok.

32:28.943 --> 32:31.121
We all know what's going on here.

32:34.210 --> 32:38.236
The smart move is to not get
involved until the dust settles.

32:38.869 --> 32:41.443
Yeah, that's the smart move, all right.

32:41.908 --> 32:43.476
What's your idea?

32:55.000 --> 32:56.659
Well, mama, I tried calling earlier,

32:56.699 --> 32:58.283
but there was no answer.

32:59.996 --> 33:02.900
You went to Stone
Mountain for the Lazerama?

33:03.593 --> 33:05.045
Did you have a picnic?

33:06.990 --> 33:08.706
Oh, I wish I'd been there.

33:13.285 --> 33:14.869
No, I'm fine, it's just…

33:15.982 --> 33:19.876
I'm dealing with a bunch of
rude jerks at work, that's all.

33:20.978 --> 33:22.077
Ha ha ha! No.

33:22.677 --> 33:25.175
Daddy can't talk to 'em. No.

33:25.874 --> 33:27.073
No, mama. No.

33:27.173 --> 33:28.832
There's nothing daddy can do.

33:28.872 --> 33:30.654
Don't put him on the phone.

33:30.670 --> 33:31.669
Hi, daddy.

33:32.668 --> 33:34.067
Oh, no.

33:34.967 --> 33:36.925
Oh, I appreciate that, you know,

33:36.965 --> 33:38.224
but I think this is something

33:38.264 --> 33:40.244
I have to deal with on my own.

33:41.461 --> 33:43.759
Hey, Brenda, I got the…

33:44.459 --> 33:46.109
No, no, it's just the TV.

33:48.655 --> 33:51.493
Yeah, I should let
y'all go to sleep there.

33:51.553 --> 33:52.352
Don't worry.

33:52.452 --> 33:53.351
I'll be fine.

33:54.250 --> 33:56.049
Ok. I love you, too.

33:57.148 --> 33:57.947
Bye-bye.

33:58.547 --> 33:59.599
Bye.

34:00.745 --> 34:02.304
How are your parents doin'?

34:02.344 --> 34:05.301
My daddy wants to fly
here and punch somebody.

34:05.341 --> 34:06.265
That's my job.

34:06.440 --> 34:07.599
Who should I start with?

34:07.639 --> 34:08.438
Maybe me.

34:09.837 --> 34:11.196
You know, it's not like I start out

34:11.235 --> 34:14.094
wantin' the FBI and the
DA. 's office to hate my guts.

34:14.134 --> 34:15.132
Just happens.

34:15.931 --> 34:17.190
Well, what am I supposed to do,

34:17.231 --> 34:19.090
tell 'em they're right
when they're wrong?

34:19.130 --> 34:20.888
I'm not paid to be agreeable.

34:20.928 --> 34:22.313
You certainly aren't.

34:22.627 --> 34:24.079
I should quit is what.

34:25.924 --> 34:27.208
Well…

34:27.822 --> 34:29.081
If you wanna resign…

34:29.121 --> 34:30.420
I have a mortgage.

34:32.717 --> 34:33.972
Quizno's is hiring.

34:40.112 --> 34:41.101
You know…

34:47.406 --> 34:49.121
I put a little money away.

34:50.303 --> 34:51.103
And…

34:53.500 --> 34:55.018
if push comes to shove,

34:55.797 --> 34:58.438
we might think about moving in together.

35:00.694 --> 35:01.948
Splitting expenses.

35:03.991 --> 35:06.499
You never come by my apartment anyway.

35:09.586 --> 35:12.044
Those are all terrible
reasons to move in together.

35:12.084 --> 35:14.130
Yeah, well, spur of the moment.

35:14.782 --> 35:17.092
Give me a chance to think about it.

35:30.385 --> 35:33.051
I've got some pictures
that might interest you.

35:33.091 --> 35:36.660
Blown up off tape we got from
L. A. metro's surveillance cameras.

35:36.700 --> 35:40.970
And impound got a pickup truck with a
lawnmower and a leaf blower in its bed

35:41.010 --> 35:44.879
towed from beneath the Ralph's on Hollywood
and Western the morning after the murder.

35:44.919 --> 35:47.024
And this…

35:47.826 --> 35:50.070
was found in the cab of the truck.

35:50.632 --> 35:52.150
Goes with the pictures.

35:54.341 --> 35:56.145
Thank you, lieutenant Tao.

35:56.646 --> 36:01.959
Um, have sergeant Gabriel meet
me outside chief Pope's office.

36:02.360 --> 36:04.725
I'm gonna have to speed
out of here like the wind.

36:04.765 --> 36:06.943
We're all pulling for you, chief.

36:07.372 --> 36:08.824
Thank you, lieutenant.

36:09.276 --> 36:10.773
That means a lot.

36:18.750 --> 36:21.126
Chief Johnson, thank you for coming.

36:22.450 --> 36:24.811
We realize this may be a
little difficult for you…

36:24.851 --> 36:26.699
Y'all didn't need to get up.

36:26.851 --> 36:28.751
I'm sorry, agent Jackson.

36:28.851 --> 36:30.211
I didn't mean to interrupt you.

36:30.251 --> 36:32.495
It's one of my bad habits. I know.

36:33.051 --> 36:33.951
Sit. Sit.

36:35.752 --> 36:37.336
Shouldn't take too long.

36:38.252 --> 36:40.826
And, yes, it has been difficult for me.

36:40.852 --> 36:42.832
It's kind of you to note that.

36:45.253 --> 36:49.015
Chief Pope, I wanna thank you
for arrangin' this meetin'.

36:50.753 --> 36:55.769
Let's get to it, because I have an
arrest to make in a murder investigation.

36:55.854 --> 36:58.362
I'd like to start with you, Ms Powell.

37:01.054 --> 37:04.654
I'd like to say how sorry I am…

37:08.855 --> 37:10.515
that I was unable to ignore

37:10.555 --> 37:12.115
your general level of incompetence

37:12.155 --> 37:15.515
in the wrongly obtained conviction
in the case of Bill Croelick,

37:15.555 --> 37:17.916
and I'm sorry if you
felt hurt and defensive

37:17.956 --> 37:19.916
about putting a man on death
row for the wrong crime,

37:19.956 --> 37:23.116
and I certainly hope that that
will never, ever happen again.

37:23.156 --> 37:27.116
Agent Jackson, I deeply regret
that the FBI handed over $2 million

37:27.156 --> 37:31.117
to a man on the terrorist watch
list without the capacity to trace it

37:31.157 --> 37:32.831
or manage to follow him for months

37:32.871 --> 37:36.017
without knowing his wife was
having an affair with the doctor.

37:36.057 --> 37:38.718
And I hope you do much
better in the future.

37:38.758 --> 37:41.218
Captain Taylor,
I suppose I should apologize to you

37:41.258 --> 37:43.318
for not having been born in Los Angeles,

37:43.358 --> 37:47.258
but having seen you work up
close now for several months,

37:47.458 --> 37:50.159
I can honestly say that try as I might,

37:50.259 --> 37:53.955
I can't think of any fair
and reasonable system on earth

37:53.959 --> 37:55.873
where I wouldn't outrank you.

37:57.959 --> 37:58.659
There.

38:00.660 --> 38:02.838
I hope that clears everything up.

38:05.160 --> 38:06.216
well, excuse me.

38:06.960 --> 38:08.071
I mean, uh,

38:08.960 --> 38:09.818
I have to go.

38:11.561 --> 38:12.961
Thank you very much.

38:14.661 --> 38:16.292
Thank you.

38:25.343 --> 38:26.406
Well…

38:28.082 --> 38:30.150
She did say she was sorry.

38:36.156 --> 38:38.730
I'm sorry. Of course, this is terrible.

38:40.549 --> 38:42.535
Terrible.

38:49.287 --> 38:50.553
Can't you just go away?

38:50.593 --> 38:51.357
I am entering this house.

38:51.397 --> 38:52.361
You can either stay here,

38:52.401 --> 38:54.571
or sergeant Gabriel here
will escort you downtown.

38:54.611 --> 38:55.514
Mama!

38:55.816 --> 38:57.283
Please! Please leave them alone!

38:57.323 --> 38:58.775
They're protecting me.

38:59.633 --> 39:01.502
Whoa. Why don't you people
just wait in the living room?

39:01.542 --> 39:02.808
First of all, we're not “you people.”

39:02.848 --> 39:04.214
We're Los Angeles police,

39:04.254 --> 39:05.319
and when we show up unexpectedly,

39:05.359 --> 39:06.525
it's not because we have a problem,

39:06.565 --> 39:07.329
it's because you do.

39:07.369 --> 39:09.941
Now, I suggest you
step aside and be quiet.

39:09.981 --> 39:11.447
I will file a grievance against you.

39:11.487 --> 39:12.954
Delia Lopez, I'll ask you again.

39:12.994 --> 39:14.361
Who were you with during the time

39:14.401 --> 39:17.776
your son-in-law was forcibly
drowned in his hot tub?

39:17.816 --> 39:20.589
–I want you out of my house!
–The answer is no one.

39:20.629 --> 39:23.201
Arrest Delia Lopez for the
murder of Richard Pruitt.

39:23.241 --> 39:24.306
I want an attorney!

39:24.346 --> 39:25.402
You'll need one.

39:25.552 --> 39:27.521
Keep her in the living
room until I come out.

39:27.561 --> 39:28.626
–What is going on?
–Step back inside.

39:28.666 --> 39:29.932
–Please, Mr Lopez.
–What is this about?

39:29.972 --> 39:35.318
I need you to make a choice about who
you're protecting with this alibi of yours.

39:42.317 --> 39:44.816
My daughter is a victim herself.

39:45.216 --> 39:46.602
Can you not see that?

39:46.615 --> 39:49.074
My wife, my wife is incapable of murder.

39:49.114 --> 39:50.474
She could help plan one,

39:50.514 --> 39:53.173
if, in her mind,
the murder was justified.

39:53.213 --> 39:55.572
You see, I can break
this alibi of yours.

39:55.612 --> 39:57.371
I can prove you don't
know where Amelia was

39:57.411 --> 39:58.471
when this murder was committed.

39:58.511 --> 39:59.610
Amelia was here.

39:59.710 --> 40:00.910
She was here.

40:01.109 --> 40:01.969
Dennis saw her.

40:02.009 --> 40:02.869
My wife saw her.

40:02.909 --> 40:04.368
You cannot prove otherwise.

40:04.408 --> 40:05.808
My daughter was here!

40:05.908 --> 40:06.898
I know she was,

40:06.907 --> 40:08.161
but where were you?

40:11.006 --> 40:12.986
One of the unexpected benefits

40:13.205 --> 40:16.439
of terrorist activity is
the excellent camerawork

40:16.803 --> 40:19.773
throughout our public
transportation systems.

40:20.402 --> 40:22.301
First movement, allegro.

40:22.601 --> 40:25.637
Alonso getting into the
subway near his house.

40:25.900 --> 40:27.899
Second movement, adagio.

40:27.999 --> 40:31.357
Alonso getting off the train
at Western and Hollywood.

40:31.397 --> 40:35.156
And here is Alonso coming home
from his son-in-law's house,

40:35.196 --> 40:38.495
his clothes damp from
drowning Richard Pruitt.

40:38.894 --> 40:39.694
Agitato.

40:40.294 --> 40:42.993
And here, the final movement, vivace.

40:43.393 --> 40:45.492
Coming home as fast as you can.

40:47.591 --> 40:51.889
Here is the cap that
you left in the truck

40:53.089 --> 40:57.247
that you bought from a used car
dealer on Melrose and Highland.

41:04.584 --> 41:05.574
That is not me.

41:07.983 --> 41:08.709
I was here,

41:09.282 --> 41:11.281
playing the entire time.

41:12.581 --> 41:15.221
It certainly sounded like you were here.

41:16.379 --> 41:17.409
But…

41:19.378 --> 41:23.137
You didn't keep Dennis around
here as an alibi for Amelia.

41:23.177 --> 41:26.015
You kept him here as
an alibi for yourself.

41:26.076 --> 41:28.135
Dennis was stalled at the dinner table

41:28.175 --> 41:30.834
so he could say he heard
you playing in the next room.

41:30.874 --> 41:32.933
But you don't have enough
memory in your playback

41:32.973 --> 41:35.132
to cover the entire
period you were away,

41:35.172 --> 41:37.031
so your wife pretended to come in

41:37.071 --> 41:38.985
and give you a plate of food.

41:39.870 --> 41:40.670
She waited,

41:41.369 --> 41:43.415
and she restarted your program,

41:43.469 --> 41:46.637
all of which makes Delia
an accessory to murder.

41:49.266 --> 41:50.066
Unless…

41:55.064 --> 41:56.449
Unless?

42:07.519 --> 42:10.973
Alonso Lopez, you are under arrest
for the murder of Richard Pruitt.

42:11.013 --> 42:12.271
You have the right to remain silent.

42:12.311 --> 42:15.465
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

42:15.505 --> 42:16.763
You have the right to an attorney.

42:16.803 --> 42:17.761
If you can't afford one,

42:17.801 --> 42:19.658
one will be provided
for you by the state.

42:19.698 --> 42:22.536
Have you heard and
understood these rights?

42:24.090 --> 42:25.288
Yes, I… I have.

42:28.283 --> 42:31.537
Would you like to waive
your right to an attorney?

42:31.577 --> 42:34.831
Because if you do, it's
possible you could tell me

42:34.871 --> 42:39.523
that your wife was surprised not to find
you in this room when she brought you dinner.

42:39.563 --> 42:41.543
She could visit you in prison.

42:42.957 --> 42:45.861
Do you understand what
I'm saying, Mr Lopez?

42:49.545 --> 42:50.730
Yes.

43:06.715 --> 43:07.865
Yes.

43:11.108 --> 43:13.418
I do waive my right to an attorney.

43:15.200 --> 43:18.994
My wife and daughter are not involved.

43:21.290 --> 43:25.682
I murdered that filth
who beat my daughter.

43:27.379 --> 43:29.076
I protected my family,

43:30.773 --> 43:33.545
as the basest of
animals is allowed to do,

43:34.866 --> 43:39.133
as I have the right to do.

43:49.202 --> 43:51.264
It doesn't matter what
Jackson and Powell think.

43:51.304 --> 43:53.152
After what she said to them?

43:53.206 --> 43:55.668
There's a limit to how much
the chief cares about all that.

43:55.708 --> 43:58.025
What really matters is the
internal part of the complaint.

43:58.065 --> 43:59.503
Well, I disagree!

43:59.538 --> 44:01.113
And it is my strong,

44:01.613 --> 44:03.857
and, frankly, unswerving position,

44:04.216 --> 44:06.378
that this department is best served

44:06.418 --> 44:09.080
when we review all
legitimate grievances,

44:09.120 --> 44:11.683
and I don't think I'm alone on this one.

44:11.723 --> 44:12.777
Really?

44:15.226 --> 44:17.628
Well, do you think, uh…

44:18.629 --> 44:21.232
Gabriel is with you?

44:23.634 --> 44:25.536
Or Daniels?

44:26.737 --> 44:30.340
Sanchez, Provenza, Tao.

44:32.142 --> 44:34.644
How about… Flynn?

44:37.847 --> 44:41.250
Resignations from every
single member of her squad,

44:41.650 --> 44:42.711
effective immediately,

44:42.751 --> 44:45.854
if chief Johnson is
transferred or put on leave

44:46.055 --> 44:51.560
in regard to any disciplinary action
relating to this anonymous complaint.

44:53.762 --> 44:59.467
Now, if someone wants to be responsible
forgetting rid of some of the best,

44:59.667 --> 45:02.330
most experienced people
in this department,

45:02.370 --> 45:04.218
many of whom you hand-picked

45:04.672 --> 45:07.378
for Priority Homicide
in the first place,

45:08.475 --> 45:10.389
I guess I can't stop someone.

45:11.378 --> 45:16.042
But if the chief decides that this was a
colossal waste of our time and our resources,

45:16.082 --> 45:18.458
there will be serious repercussions.

45:19.786 --> 45:21.238
If, on the other hand,

45:21.587 --> 45:24.359
this complaint were
to suddenly disappear,

45:25.691 --> 45:29.651
loath as I am to suggest it,
there is a promotion available.

45:35.600 --> 45:37.382
Commander Scott's position.

45:37.502 --> 45:39.350
One rank below deputy chief.

45:40.705 --> 45:42.949
Any chance he might be interested?

45:52.634 --> 45:55.573
Here's the transcript for
Alonso Lopez's confession.

45:55.613 --> 45:58.476
Thanks, Buzz. You can
just put it in there.

46:00.280 --> 46:02.722
The truck's been sent over to S. I. D

46:09.017 --> 46:12.911
Lieutenant, you think there's
any chance this may backfire?

46:14.280 --> 46:16.829
We're about to find out right now.

46:30.372 --> 46:34.762
So, we have a summation
of a case to write.

46:37.157 --> 46:38.345
Detective Daniels,

46:39.552 --> 46:42.745
if you could do that for us.

46:44.541 --> 46:45.531
Lieutenant Tao,

46:46.935 --> 46:50.367
you could catalogue the
evidence and autopsy report.

46:51.824 --> 46:54.219
And, uh, summation of statements.

46:54.319 --> 46:55.639
Lieutenant Provenza?

46:57.612 --> 46:59.790
You might get to see Sandy again.

47:02.700 --> 47:03.897
Detective Sanchez,

47:04.894 --> 47:06.478
summation of statements.

47:08.886 --> 47:10.183
Lieutenant Flynn.

47:12.178 --> 47:14.950
Your resignation
surprised me most of all.

47:15.870 --> 47:16.928
The whole time I've been here,

47:16.968 --> 47:20.730
you've never said one
complimentary thing about or to me.

47:29.240 --> 47:32.333
Chief, you have really great legs.

47:39.218 --> 47:40.340
Lieutenant Flynn.

47:44.407 --> 47:46.519
Fill out the conclusion section.

47:48.198 --> 47:49.655
Let's have that out
to the DA. 's office.

47:49.695 --> 47:51.543
Make the charges murder one.

47:53.985 --> 47:55.437
And, sergeant Gabriel,

47:57.478 --> 47:58.675
if you could, uh,

47:58.875 --> 48:01.668
walk the boxes over to their offices.

48:04.662 --> 48:07.316
And then, I think it
might be appropriate,

48:07.356 --> 48:10.010
well, chief Pope tells
me that sometimes,

48:10.050 --> 48:12.404
at the conclusion of a successful case,

48:12.444 --> 48:15.737
y'all gather at O'Malley's to celebrate.

48:16.336 --> 48:18.910
And I thought, under the circumstances,

48:20.028 --> 48:20.826
I'd…

48:22.422 --> 48:24.336
I'd like to buy y'all drinks.
