WEBVTT

00:16.550 --> 00:18.643
* Get up, get up, get up

00:18.680 --> 00:20.511
* Yeah

00:21.620 --> 00:23.588
* Wake up, wake up, wake up

00:23.620 --> 00:26.214
* Mmm...

00:26.260 --> 00:27.659
* Ooh-ooh

00:27.690 --> 00:32.059
* Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh...

00:32.100 --> 00:33.328
Senator, um,
as I've been saying--

00:33.360 --> 00:34.497
we're here for your protection.

00:34.530 --> 00:36.088
And, as I have
been saying--

00:36.130 --> 00:37.461
I appreciate
all the attention,

00:37.500 --> 00:39.058
but I don't believe
I'm in any danger.

00:39.100 --> 00:40.738
Can I ask now,
Granddad?

00:40.770 --> 00:42.203
You bet, Haley.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.663
And you tell me
if you think she's fooling.

00:44.710 --> 00:46.337
Go ahead,
honey.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.132
Okay, June 3, 2003.

00:48.180 --> 00:51.206
June 3, 2003, was a Tuesday.

00:51.250 --> 00:53.411
George Bush landed
in Egypt.

00:53.450 --> 00:55.771
The baseball player Sammy Sosa
was thrown out of a game

00:55.820 --> 00:57.139
for having cork in his bat.

00:57.190 --> 01:00.216
And, let me guess--
you were born.

01:00.260 --> 01:01.215
You're right.

01:01.260 --> 01:02.227
She's right.

01:02.260 --> 01:04.228
How'd you do that?

01:04.260 --> 01:05.818
Well, Haley,
I have a very special gift--

01:05.860 --> 01:07.259
I remember everything.

01:07.300 --> 01:09.165
Yeah, you might want
to remember your job.

01:09.200 --> 01:10.519
Oh. _
Just saying.

01:10.570 --> 01:11.525
Okay. All right.

01:11.570 --> 01:12.662
Nice to meet you.

01:12.700 --> 01:14.258
Nice to meet you, too.

01:14.300 --> 01:17.531
Senator, Interpol
and the NYPD are convinced

01:17.570 --> 01:20.778
you are a potential
assassination target.

01:20.810 --> 01:22.539
Because why?
I went to some silly conference?

01:22.580 --> 01:24.343
Hell, I only went
for the skiing, you know.

01:24.380 --> 01:26.109
And it rained
just about every day.

01:26.150 --> 01:28.710
Three other people who attended
the Davos Conference...

01:28.750 --> 01:30.513
have been poisoned. Two died.

01:30.550 --> 01:33.553
And Interpol believes the killer
has entered the United States.

01:33.590 --> 01:34.887
We just want to keep you safe.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.126
Right, Carrie?

01:36.160 --> 01:37.184
Yes. Right.

01:37.230 --> 01:38.527
We just want to keep you safe.

01:38.560 --> 01:39.891
Well, that is very kind of you,

01:39.930 --> 01:42.194
but I've been in public life
for 30 years--

01:42.230 --> 01:43.629
I'm tougher than I look.

01:43.670 --> 01:46.389
Believe me,
my man Nolan can handle

01:46.440 --> 01:47.634
whatever situation arises.

01:47.670 --> 01:49.262
Plus, I got
that mean-looking fellow

01:49.310 --> 01:50.629
the festival's _
provrdlng me gratIs.

01:50.670 --> 01:53.230
Sir, we're talking
about a professional assassin.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.633
We don't know
how he delivers the poison,

01:54.680 --> 01:57.171
but we know he does it
under cover of large crowds.

01:57.210 --> 01:58.768
Fine.

01:58.810 --> 02:02.143
You can do whatever it is
you thInk you have to do

02:02.190 --> 02:03.885
since your dynamo
partner here
Aw.

02:03.920 --> 02:06.184
has so graciously entertained
my granddaughter.

02:06.220 --> 02:08.518
Well, let's do this then, yeah?
Okay.

02:08.560 --> 02:10.255
We're ready for you, Senator.

02:10.290 --> 02:11.279
Uh...

02:11.330 --> 02:12.297
Let me help you, sir.
Thank you.

02:12.330 --> 02:13.854
Okay.

02:13.900 --> 02:16.323
You know, you catch more flies
with honey than with vinegar.

02:16.370 --> 02:19.168
You think I was just playing,
but I had a whole master plan.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.690
And, look at that, it worked.
Mission accomplished.

02:20.740 --> 02:22.332
How'd you know
it was her birthday?

02:22.370 --> 02:24.167
I'm brilliant.
Hmm.

02:24.210 --> 02:25.802
Jay, we're on the move.
What's your situation?

02:25.840 --> 02:28.172
Well, place is really
filling up.

02:28.210 --> 02:30.542
It's clear from here.

02:34.580 --> 02:36.343
I wish I knew what
we were looking for.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.244
Interpol and Homeland
don't know much more.

02:38.290 --> 02:40.178
Whoever these guys are,
they move like shadows.

02:45.560 --> 02:47.699
*

03:01.440 --> 03:03.601
Ah, Senator Carlyle.

03:03.650 --> 03:05.845
I'm Murphy Cloonan.
So pleased you could make it.

03:05.880 --> 03:08.212
So, this is the check
I'll be presenting

03:08.250 --> 03:08.978
on behalf
of your foundation.

03:09.020 --> 03:11.238
Fine, fine.

03:11.290 --> 03:12.655
Is there anything in particular
you'd like me to say

03:12.690 --> 03:13.679
in your introduction?

03:13.720 --> 03:16.325
Nope, just make
it quick.

03:16.360 --> 03:17.281
I'll cover the
other side.
All right.

03:17.330 --> 03:18.319
Let's do it.
Okay.

03:18.360 --> 03:19.497
All right.

03:19.530 --> 03:20.827
Murray--

03:20.860 --> 03:23.226
anything out of the ordinary,
abort.

03:23.270 --> 03:24.760
No "wait and see."
We make the call.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.336
It's all good.

03:35.910 --> 03:37.798
Ladies and gentlemen,

03:37.850 --> 03:41.240
it is my great honor
and pleasure

03:41.280 --> 03:44.340
to bring to the stage now a
former member of the Senate,

03:44.390 --> 03:47.018
a true captain of business,

03:47.060 --> 03:49.255
the guiding light
of the Carlyle Foundation,

03:49.290 --> 03:50.780
and an all-around
great American--

03:50.830 --> 03:53.492
Senator Thomas Carlyle.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.288
Thank you.

03:58.330 --> 03:59.866
Thank you.
You're too kind.

04:01.300 --> 04:02.267
Let me help you sir.

04:02.310 --> 04:04.369
Thank you.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.604
Okay.

04:07.380 --> 04:08.802
CARRIE:
Al, the water level.

04:55.360 --> 04:56.827
Hey, you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.707
Oh, my...

05:29.860 --> 05:32.021
JAY: Okay, our dead suspect
is Nikos Hastis--

05:32.060 --> 05:34.699
low-level operative
out of Cyprus,

05:34.730 --> 05:36.618
rumored to have ties
to "Revolutionary Struggle,"

05:36.670 --> 05:38.069
a terrorist group.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.465
How'd he get
in the country?

05:39.500 --> 05:40.159
Came here on a work visa.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.531
Now apparently this guy's done

05:41.570 --> 05:42.969
private security jobs

05:43.010 --> 05:44.762
all over the world.
Speaking of security--

05:44.810 --> 05:47.574
we found the security guard
he switched out at the festival,

05:47.610 --> 05:49.032
throat cut, in a Dumpster.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.604
How does all this sync up

05:50.650 --> 05:51.969
with the previous attacks?

05:52.010 --> 05:54.945
Well, both Jean-Marc Keller,
a Swiss banker,

05:54.980 --> 05:57.881
and Gustave Bauchau,
Belgian manufacturing big shot,

05:57.920 --> 05:59.649
attended
the Davos Economic Conference,

05:59.690 --> 06:01.009
along with Senator Carlyle.

06:01.060 --> 06:03.654
Both of them died
very uncomfortably.

06:03.690 --> 06:05.851
No positive ID.
of the toxins used.

06:05.890 --> 06:08.393
There were thousands of people
at that conference.

06:08.430 --> 06:10.489
Still, it's the only link
we got so far.

06:10.530 --> 06:11.997
But it's the same M.O.--

06:12.030 --> 06:14.134
poison, big crowd to cover
the identity of the killer,

06:14.170 --> 06:16.400
and by the time these guys
found out they were dosed,

06:16.440 --> 06:18.499
it was too late _
to do anything about It.

06:18.540 --> 06:20.508
Let's_ see if we can track
Nikos's movements

06:20.540 --> 06:22.405
and tie him
to the prior murders.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.577
And let's find out how he was
spending his time in New York.

06:24.610 --> 06:27.443
I want to make sure he didn't
offer a bottle of water

06:27.480 --> 06:28.640
to anyone else
before we caught up to him.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.648
You got it.

06:30.690 --> 06:32.555
Hey.
Oh, hi.

06:32.590 --> 06:33.818
Nice work this morning.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.816
Next time I need a body guard,
I'm calling you.

06:35.860 --> 06:36.986
Next time?
Wha...?

06:37.030 --> 06:38.486
Was there ever a time?

06:38.530 --> 06:39.724
Oh, long time ago.

06:39.760 --> 06:42.524
I was teaching a seminar
at Columbia,

06:42.570 --> 06:45.562
and I had the nephew of a
certain Uruguayan dictator

06:45.600 --> 06:46.669
in my class...

06:46.700 --> 06:47.837
Ooh, did someone try
to kill him?

06:47.870 --> 06:48.894
No! No, no, no.

06:48.940 --> 06:50.202
Nothing like that.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.935
He was absent all the time.

06:51.970 --> 06:54.074
Tanked the final.
I had to give him a "D."

06:54.110 --> 06:55.839
So, he tried to kill you?

06:55.880 --> 06:57.199
No, but his uncle was
pretty mad.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.899
You probably dashed his hopes

06:58.950 --> 07:00.770
of ever going to medical school.

07:00.820 --> 07:02.981
: Hardly-- it was the
culinary arts school.

07:03.020 --> 07:05.147
It was "The Essentials
of Puff Pastry."

07:05.190 --> 07:06.509
Oh.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.788
I let him take
a make-up.

07:07.820 --> 07:10.789
He made an incredible
rustlco lecesse.

07:10.830 --> 07:12.081
Got a B-minus.

07:12.130 --> 07:14.121
He's now running
a four-star restaurant

07:14.160 --> 07:15.195
in Montevideo.

07:15.230 --> 07:17.164
Oh, wow.
His uncle sent me

07:17.200 --> 07:19.020
an amazing bottle of Grappamiel.

07:19.070 --> 07:21.937
Hmm.
Speaking of which,
you look hung over.

07:21.970 --> 07:23.039
Well, I'm... I'm not.

07:23.070 --> 07:24.207
Sorry.

07:24.240 --> 07:25.502
Where are we...
on the water bottle?

07:25.540 --> 07:26.700
Okay.

07:26.740 --> 07:29.868
I found definite
traces of aconite,

07:29.910 --> 07:31.571
otherwise known as wolfsbane.

07:31.610 --> 07:34.511
It presents in a fever
and slight nausea.

07:34.550 --> 07:36.609
And just when you think you're
ready to go to the hospital,

07:36.650 --> 07:38.538
after about 24 hours--
boom, you're dead.

07:38.590 --> 07:39.818
Complete systems failure.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.680
Hard to come by?
Very.

07:41.720 --> 07:44.188
The extraction process is
highly complex, so...

07:44.230 --> 07:45.652
your guy must have had

07:45.690 --> 07:47.954
a pretty sophisticated knowledge
of chemistry.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.524
That's what's bothering me.

07:49.570 --> 07:52.960
Nikos Hastis was a career thug,
not a brilliant chemist.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.888
So, you're thinking there's
someone else out there?

07:54.940 --> 07:57.238
Yeah, I do.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.073
AL: I talked to the desk clerk,
not much.

08:02.110 --> 08:04.271
Nikos checked in
a couple days ago,

08:04.310 --> 08:06.778
registered under his own name--
pretty ballsy.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.970
Yeah, he never
expected to get caught.

08:14.960 --> 08:17.281
Hmm. This is weird.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.924
"Koban Imports."

08:19.960 --> 08:22.861
Looks like he had these uniforms
made outside the country.

08:22.900 --> 08:24.197
Fake papers.

08:24.230 --> 08:26.539
But where's
the chemistry equrpment?

08:26.570 --> 08:28.094
According to Webster,

08:28.140 --> 08:30.665
the wolfsbane required
elaborate preparation.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.530
Maybe he had a lab
somewhere else.

08:32.580 --> 08:33.672
Al, I'm with Carrie.

08:33.710 --> 08:35.268
This just doesn't feel
like our guy.

08:39.010 --> 08:41.843
Jay

08:41.880 --> 08:43.780
What you got on Koban Imports?

08:43.820 --> 08:47.153
Hold on one second, Al.

08:47.190 --> 08:49.829
All right, it looks like they're
over in Long Island City.

08:49.860 --> 08:52.226
Been in business since 1995.

08:52.260 --> 08:54.228
Owners are Elizabeth
and Eric Koban.

08:54.260 --> 08:55.796
Says here they live
on the premises as well.

08:55.830 --> 08:58.128
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold on a second.

08:58.170 --> 08:59.865
This is a little weird, Al.

08:59.900 --> 09:01.333
I just got an EMS alert.

09:01.370 --> 09:03.838
Ambulance has been dispatched
to that location.

09:05.070 --> 09:07.231
Murray, let's go.

09:25.630 --> 09:27.359
I-I couldn't get her to wake up.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.288
How could this happen?

09:29.330 --> 09:30.627
I-I don't understand.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.358
Liz was stressed
about something,

09:35.400 --> 09:38.164
so, she wanted to relax
while I finished dinner.

09:38.210 --> 09:40.599
Any idea what was
bothering her?

09:40.640 --> 09:41.675
No.

09:41.710 --> 09:43.701
I mean, times are hard
right now.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.308
We were having trouble
making ends meet.

09:45.350 --> 09:47.238
But things seemed to be getting
a little better.

09:47.280 --> 09:50.943
She, uh, poured a glass of wine,

09:50.990 --> 09:53.652
and went into the living room.

09:53.690 --> 09:56.113
How long before
you checked on her?

09:56.160 --> 09:57.787
About 45 minutes?

09:57.830 --> 10:00.151
Ithoughtshe
was just asleep.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.929
I did everything I could--
I called 911.

10:01.960 --> 10:04.121
The ambulance came, they said
they couldn't do anything.

10:04.170 --> 10:06.161
That bottle of wine,
you said it was delivered?

10:06.200 --> 10:07.360
From the wine store.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.038
It came just like that,
with a ribbon

10:09.070 --> 10:11.630
and a thank you card--
no name.

10:11.670 --> 10:13.638
I don't understand--
what does that have to do...

10:13.680 --> 10:15.807
Do you know what time
it was delivered?
About 4:00.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.046
Would someone please tell me
what's going on?

10:17.080 --> 10:18.672
After Nikos was dead.

10:18.710 --> 10:23.386
Mr. Koban, we think your
wife may have been poisoned.

10:23.420 --> 10:25.741
You recognize this man?

10:25.790 --> 10:27.382
No.

10:27.420 --> 10:30.127
I don't understand-- why would
someone want to kill my wife?

10:30.160 --> 10:33.049
We don't know,
but we're gonna find out.

10:37.200 --> 10:38.724
Diabolical.

10:38.770 --> 10:40.738
He took a hypodermic needle,

10:40.770 --> 10:44.001
injected the poison
through the cork.

10:44.040 --> 10:46.838
There's no way that hole could
be seen by the naked eye.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.438
What kind of poison did he use?

10:48.480 --> 10:50.402
A venom-- tetrodotoxin.

10:50.450 --> 10:51.701
Puffer fish.
Yeah.

10:51.750 --> 10:53.149
I know my sushi.

10:53.180 --> 10:55.319
A much faster-acting poison
than the others.

10:55.350 --> 10:58.410
I finally contacted the M.E.'s
in Switzerland and Belgium,

10:58.450 --> 11:01.908
he used dimethylmercury in one,
and polonium in the other.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.450
That's quite an arsenal, huh?

11:03.490 --> 11:05.151
Hmm... Elizabeth Koban...

11:05.190 --> 11:07.055
had nothing to do with Davos.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.352
No, but she did help him, um...

11:10.870 --> 11:12.838
...import the uniforms, right?
So...

11:12.870 --> 11:14.394
Are you okay?

11:14.440 --> 11:17.807
I... I'm feeling a little off.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.728
You look awful.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.236
Oh, Carrie.
You're burning up.

11:21.280 --> 11:22.907
How long have you felt this way?

11:22.950 --> 11:25.248
I started feeling...
crappy this afternoon,

11:25.280 --> 11:27.316
and it feels like...

11:27.350 --> 11:28.715
_ It feels like
It's getting worse.

11:29.820 --> 11:31.287
Since the chase.

11:32.990 --> 11:34.014
Since the chase.

11:36.460 --> 11:38.826
Carrie, is it possible
you were poisoned?

11:39.900 --> 11:41.891
I...

11:47.140 --> 11:48.493
Okay, so what do we do?

11:48.540 --> 11:50.007
WEBSTER:
Well, as Dr. Miller
was saying--

11:50.040 --> 11:52.133
we have to find out
how she was porsoned.

11:52.170 --> 11:55.071
Exactly, the surest path to
saving your life is finding

11:55.110 --> 11:58.876
the person who poisoned you and
identifying the toxins he used.

11:58.910 --> 12:00.775
Okay, then let's get going.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.117
You can't work your own case.
You need rest.

12:02.150 --> 12:03.742
I'm too pissed off to rest.

12:03.790 --> 12:07.817
Besides, weirdly,
I feel fine right now.

12:07.860 --> 12:10.055
Detective Wells, depending on
the poison and the dosage,

12:10.090 --> 12:11.751
you'll feel strong,
and then weak,

12:11.790 --> 12:13.394
and then strong again;

12:13.430 --> 12:17.218
but, untreated, this process
will continue on and off

12:17.270 --> 12:18.521
until, well, without warning,

12:18.570 --> 12:22.062
you'll experience complete
systemic shutdown.

12:22.100 --> 12:25.103
Wow. Well, that doesn't sound
like much fun, does it?

12:25.140 --> 12:27.074
You know what?
While I'm still feeling strong,

12:27.110 --> 12:28.930
I'm gonna head out
and save my life, okay?

12:28.980 --> 12:29.844
Thanks for racing
over, Phil.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.074
Carrie, where do you
think you're going?

12:31.110 --> 12:32.407
To catch my murderer.

12:32.450 --> 12:34.475
I told her she needs to be
in a hospital.
Carrie,

12:34.520 --> 12:37.080
Dr. Miller is the head of
toxicology at Mt. Sinai.

12:37.120 --> 12:38.280
If he believes
you should be admitted,

12:38.320 --> 12:39.856
you should be admitted.

12:39.890 --> 12:41.050
Oh, really?
So, you want me to just

12:41.090 --> 12:43.149
lay in a hospital bed and die?

12:43.190 --> 12:45.158
I'm going to die anyway,
so I may as well go out while...

12:45.190 --> 12:46.452
Shut up and just listen...

12:46.490 --> 12:48.026
With all due respect,

12:48.060 --> 12:50.119
knowing her the way I do,
the way we all do,

12:50.170 --> 12:53.389
there's no way she's staying
in a hospital bed right now.
Right.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.193
You need to be under a doctor's
close superwsron.

12:56.240 --> 12:59.129
Oh.
Joanne Webster's a doctor.

12:59.170 --> 13:01.274
Not a "doctor" doctor,
more of a dead person's doctor.

13:01.310 --> 13:02.948
But a doctor nonetheless,
and I like her.

13:02.980 --> 13:04.174
And she makes
me laugh.

13:04.210 --> 13:05.404
Will you supervise me?

13:05.450 --> 13:06.940
Yes.

13:06.980 --> 13:08.174
Supervised.

13:08.220 --> 13:09.175
Burns.

13:10.890 --> 13:12.209
Carrie.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.353
I'm working this.

13:13.390 --> 13:15.551
Let me do_ it-:
you can't rIsk It.

13:15.590 --> 13:18.855
_ Listen to me.
Listen to me, okay?

13:18.890 --> 13:20.198
If you'd been poisoned,

13:20.230 --> 13:22.596
and you had maybe
less than two days to live,

13:22.630 --> 13:24.188
who would you want
working the case?

13:24.230 --> 13:25.891
You.
And you.

13:25.930 --> 13:29.559
You and me together, we
can solve anything, right?

13:29.600 --> 13:32.501
And if we work fast enough,
then-then we can solve this.

13:32.540 --> 13:36.203
I'll let you know if it gets
to be too much, I promise.

13:36.240 --> 13:40.142
But right now, we're
the only chance I've got, Al.

13:48.590 --> 13:50.455
What do you have?

13:50.490 --> 13:54.153
Okay, so back at the Bureau,
my team had numerous cases

13:54.200 --> 13:57.192
where victims belonged to
several overlapping groups.

13:57.230 --> 13:59.266
So, we developed our own
algorithm to narrow the focus,

13:59.300 --> 14:02.167
which I kind of borrowed
on the way out.
It's pretty cool.

14:02.200 --> 14:04.430
I'm sure it is, but
we already know the connection--

14:04.470 --> 14:05.437
the Davos Conference.

14:05.470 --> 14:06.971
Yeah, I thought so, too.

14:07.010 --> 14:08.238
But then we widened our search.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.305
And we located
five other

14:10.350 --> 14:12.477
unexplained, sudden deaths--
all potential poisonings.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.340
Shimon Furst, Israeli banker--

14:16.380 --> 14:18.382
died last year
in a Tel Aviv hospital.

14:18.420 --> 14:21.082
Next we've got Roland Mercure,
French real estate mogul--

14:21.120 --> 14:22.189
died six months ago.

14:22.220 --> 14:23.619
And Nigel Adams,

14:23.660 --> 14:25.218
presumed victim
of a cardiac infection

14:25.260 --> 14:26.488
three months ago in London.

14:26.530 --> 14:28.998
Thing is, none of these guys
were at Davos.

14:29.030 --> 14:31.021
But they were, along
with our other victims,

14:31.070 --> 14:32.219
investors in...

14:32.270 --> 14:34.329
Linear Oil Systems.

14:34.370 --> 14:36.338
_ It's a small_
International refinery.

14:36.370 --> 14:38.235
They were in the news
for a pipeline spill

14:38.270 --> 14:39.464
in Nigeria two years ago.

14:39.510 --> 14:41.637
Destroyed thousands of acres.

14:41.680 --> 14:44.342
Every one of our victims,
plus these three guys,

14:44.380 --> 14:45.642
helped finance that project.

14:45.680 --> 14:47.375
Davos isn't the connection.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.547
Linear Oil Systems is.

14:49.580 --> 14:52.014
And Carrie and_ Elizabeth Koban
just got In the way.

14:52.050 --> 14:54.359
Carrie was right on Nikos's
tail, I get bringing her down.

14:54.390 --> 14:56.187
But why Koban?

14:56.220 --> 14:58.324
He used her to bring in
those security uniforms.

14:58.360 --> 14:59.588
Maybe she got nosey.

14:59.630 --> 15:02.224
All right,
get on Koban Imports--

15:02.260 --> 15:04.296
bank statements, business
receipts, everything.

15:04.330 --> 15:06.218
He killed her for a reason,
let's find out what it was.

15:06.270 --> 15:08.329
And I want to know more
about that oil spill.

15:08.370 --> 15:09.598
Something bad like that happens,

15:09.640 --> 15:11.528
it creates a lot of_ resentment
and motIve.

15:21.320 --> 15:22.947
Your heart rate is
still elevated,

15:22.990 --> 15:25.311
your white blood cells are
through the roof.

15:25.350 --> 15:27.318
Your body is fighting this,

15:27.360 --> 15:30.579
but any strenuous activity is
just gonna make things worse.

15:30.630 --> 15:35.329
Carrie, you know I'm not mushy,
but you matter to me.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.294
I want you to take
care of yourself.

15:37.330 --> 15:39.525
Then help me fight, okay?

15:39.570 --> 15:41.299
Let's just...

15:41.340 --> 15:43.331
We gotta figure this out.
We gotta-we gotta...

15:43.370 --> 15:45.406
walk it through
and figure it out, all right?

15:47.440 --> 15:52.377
I was chasing Nikos Hastis.

15:52.410 --> 15:55.516
Somehow I _must have
gotten p0Isoned...

15:55.550 --> 15:58.348
during the chase.

15:58.390 --> 15:59.618
But the question is when.

15:59.650 --> 16:01.151
And how.

16:01.190 --> 16:02.612
Ijust...

16:02.660 --> 16:05.288
The first moment...

16:05.330 --> 16:06.991
could have been
when I knocked the water bottle

16:07.030 --> 16:09.089
out of Carlyle's hand.

16:15.770 --> 16:17.738
But that water never touched me.

16:17.770 --> 16:20.978
There were so many people there,
I just...

16:25.180 --> 16:26.408
If Nikos did have a partner,

16:26.450 --> 16:29.112
and he was in the crowd...

16:29.150 --> 16:33.086
Is it possible he stuck me with
a needle, some kind of needle?

16:33.120 --> 16:35.008
If he was trained
in the Balkans,

16:35.060 --> 16:38.086
they-they sometimes use
tiny needles in pens,

16:38.130 --> 16:39.722
so... yeah, it's possible.

16:42.430 --> 16:44.318
All right, wait a second.
There were these, um...

16:44.370 --> 16:49.034
...curtains, these big, heavy,
black curtains.

16:52.210 --> 16:53.234
And they were covered in dust.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.373
He made a point of pulling them
down on top of me.

16:55.410 --> 16:58.072
And I was choking on the dust,
but then he would have...

16:58.110 --> 17:00.442
He would have had to have
prepared them in advance, right?

17:00.480 --> 17:03.278
Yeah, and airborne toxins are
not really this guy's thing.

17:03.320 --> 17:04.389
Wait a second.

17:07.790 --> 17:10.588
There was a cleaning guy
that came out of nowhere.

17:10.630 --> 17:14.555
Hey. You okay?

17:14.600 --> 17:17.524
I-I slipped, and I fell.

17:17.570 --> 17:20.391
Maybe something got on me?

17:20.440 --> 17:22.431
Was there a smell?
AnythIng unusual.

17:22.470 --> 17:25.109
Yeah, there...
like a-a... burning smell.

17:25.140 --> 17:26.607
Sulfur.
Yeah.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.471
That could be it.

17:28.510 --> 17:29.829
What did he look like?

17:29.880 --> 17:31.802
Uh...

17:38.820 --> 17:42.415
I know I looked
at him, but...

17:44.660 --> 17:48.528
...I don't think I saw his face.

17:52.800 --> 17:57.533
I-I don't, I don't think
I've got what we need.

17:57.570 --> 17:59.834
It could be just enough.

17:59.870 --> 18:03.306
It's waterborne,
sulfur-based.

18:03.350 --> 18:05.409
It's a good start.

18:05.450 --> 18:07.418
Okay.

18:10.550 --> 18:11.881
Hey.

18:11.920 --> 18:14.480
So, where are we on
that maintenance guy?

18:14.520 --> 18:16.579
Um...

18:19.830 --> 18:22.219
Do I have a milk mustache
on my face?

18:22.260 --> 18:24.490
Because I keep telling
my guy, Jerry,

18:24.530 --> 18:28.432
to make my cappuccino dry, but
he makes it wet with extra foam.

18:28.470 --> 18:30.563
So, Jay,
the maintenance guy.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.534
Uh, yeah. Sure. Sorry.

18:33.580 --> 18:34.569
All right, listen.

18:34.610 --> 18:35.531
I know I'm a zombie,

18:35.580 --> 18:37.571
but I don't smell, yet, do I?

18:37.610 --> 18:39.703
We're all just concerned,
that's all.

18:39.750 --> 18:41.718
I know, I'm concerned, too.
But I just...

18:43.450 --> 18:44.542
Well, you look so sad.

18:44.590 --> 18:46.808
Let's just get this out, okay?

18:46.850 --> 18:48.488
There's something you want
to tell me, Jay.

18:48.520 --> 18:49.817
Just go ahead. What?

18:49.860 --> 18:52.829
I don't want you to die.

18:53.860 --> 18:56.420
'Cause you still
owe me that 50 bucks

18:56.460 --> 18:57.791
from fantasy football last year.

19:00.770 --> 19:03.603
Well, I-I don't want to die,
either, because...

19:03.640 --> 19:05.608
I still haven't taught you
how to count cards.

19:05.640 --> 19:08.438
Right.
And on the maintenance guy--

19:08.480 --> 19:10.744
the venue's got no record
of anyone working the festival.

19:10.780 --> 19:11.906
We're still on it.

19:11.950 --> 19:13.645
CARRIE: All right.
Hey.

19:13.680 --> 19:15.375
Hey.

19:15.420 --> 19:16.819
Okay.

19:16.850 --> 19:18.613
So, I was going over
the financial records

19:18.650 --> 19:19.742
for Koban Imports.

19:19.790 --> 19:21.610
They've been struggling.

19:21.660 --> 19:23.525
But it turns out they got
two rather large deposits

19:23.560 --> 19:24.754
in the past month.

19:24.790 --> 19:26.621
Both cash, just under $10,000--

19:26.660 --> 19:28.753
so it wasn't reported
to the IRS.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.927
You think they came from Nikos?

19:30.970 --> 19:32.790
Yeah, but that seems
like way too much money

19:32.830 --> 19:34.491
for fake security uniforms, huh?

19:34.540 --> 19:36.929
But not for something
a little more lethal.

19:36.970 --> 19:38.699
JAY: And if our guy still needs
that something back...

19:38.740 --> 19:41.379
I had a couple of unis hang out
to keep an eye on things.

19:41.410 --> 19:43.571
We need to get over there.

20:04.630 --> 20:08.532
WOMAN: 911.
Lieutenant Burns, Major Crimes,
requesting a 10-13.

20:08.570 --> 20:11.437
Officer shot
at 1216 163rd Street.

20:23.750 --> 20:24.842
Carrie.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.667
There was a car right here.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.429
A rental. You got the plate?

20:44.470 --> 20:47.701
Uh, I-I-I didn't...
I didn't see it.

20:47.740 --> 20:48.900
Yeah, you did.

20:48.940 --> 20:50.771
You looked right at
it when we came in.

20:50.810 --> 20:52.277
It was red, four-door.

20:52.310 --> 20:53.641
You got anything?

20:53.680 --> 20:55.318
The make and model?

20:57.950 --> 20:59.941
I-I can't remember.

21:11.330 --> 21:13.366
Business was closed
for obVIous reasons.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.038
Eric Koban was
at the funeral home,

21:15.070 --> 21:16.890
making arrangements
for Elizabeth.

21:16.940 --> 21:18.567
So, the killer returns
to get reloaded,

21:18.610 --> 21:20.430
or clear out his stash,
and finds our guys.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.699
Koban confirmed that his wife
mentIoned leasmg these lockers,

21:23.750 --> 21:25.877
but she didn't say to whom,
and no paperwork was filled out.

21:25.910 --> 21:28.014
Strictly a cash under-the-table
offer, I imagine.

21:28.050 --> 21:30.541
And then she opens one,
doesn't like what she finds,

21:30.590 --> 21:31.545
confronts him.

21:31.590 --> 21:32.943
And that's what gets her killed.

21:32.990 --> 21:34.412
When I catch this guy,
there's no telling

21:34.460 --> 21:35.552
what I'm gonna do to him.

21:35.590 --> 21:37.729
Hmm.
Check with the CSUs

21:37.760 --> 21:39.318
one last time-- see if
they turned up anythIng else.

21:39.360 --> 21:41.453
You got it.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.889
Jo, what do we got?

21:43.930 --> 21:47.593
Oh, a Pandora's box of poisons,
illegal chemicals.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.494
There are two boxes
of spiders in there.

21:49.540 --> 21:51.599
This guy really liked
to mix things up.

21:51.640 --> 21:52.902
Can any of this help Carrie?

21:52.940 --> 21:54.407
'Cause I need
something here, Jo.

21:54.440 --> 21:55.976
Yes, actually it can.

21:56.010 --> 21:57.648
Whatever was used on Carrie

21:57.680 --> 21:58.977
is almost definitely in one of

21:59.010 --> 22:00.648
those boxes.
Plus the fact

22:00.680 --> 22:02.910
_that we now know
It was a neurotoxm.

22:02.950 --> 22:04.486
Because of her memory?

22:04.520 --> 22:05.714
Yeah, bad news for her,
but it might just be

22:05.750 --> 22:07.081
the thing that saves her life.

22:08.590 --> 22:11.058
I need you to tell me the truth.

22:11.090 --> 22:12.580
What's about to happen?

22:12.630 --> 22:14.848
Neurotoxins attack the brain.

22:14.900 --> 22:16.891
Each one does it differently.

22:16.930 --> 22:18.124
She's obviously weaker,

22:18.170 --> 22:19.728
plus the memory loss,

22:19.770 --> 22:21.135
which is particularly cruel
in her case.

22:21.170 --> 22:22.967
She may have
seizures.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.865
But there's no way
to predict any of this stuff.

22:24.910 --> 22:27.060
We need to do
something for her.

22:27.110 --> 22:29.499
Well, I will take care
of what's in there.

22:29.540 --> 22:31.770
You just make sure
that she slows down

22:31.810 --> 22:34.574
and maybe the poison
will slow down, too.

22:58.810 --> 23:00.937
Hey.
You all right?

23:00.980 --> 23:02.004
Uh-huh.

23:03.650 --> 23:05.003
Listen.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.041
What if, um...

23:07.080 --> 23:08.547
what if I just
pulled the car out

23:08.580 --> 23:09.808
and we drove away?

23:09.850 --> 23:11.511
Really?

23:11.550 --> 23:14.053
Pick up a
bottle of wine.

23:14.090 --> 23:16.479
Get that bread you like,
with the cheese.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.023
We could head down
to the water and...

23:19.060 --> 23:20.550
Pretend.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.991
Yeah.
Maybe.

23:24.030 --> 23:26.521
That'd be nice.

23:26.570 --> 23:28.538
Let someone else be cops
for a while.
Oh...

23:28.570 --> 23:30.060
You've done enough.

23:30.100 --> 23:31.909
Give Jo time

23:31.940 --> 23:33.134
to find the antidote,

23:33.170 --> 23:34.728
let us all take over.

23:34.780 --> 23:36.475
What if she doesn't?

23:36.510 --> 23:38.046
What if she doesn't
find an antidote?

23:42.520 --> 23:44.112
And anyway, when have
I ever slowed down?

23:44.150 --> 23:45.549
I'm not slowing down.

23:45.590 --> 23:47.888
One of two things
is gonna happen here.

23:47.920 --> 23:49.512
I'm gonna keep going,

23:49.560 --> 23:53.121
until, to quote that incredibly
optimistic Dr. Miller,

23:53.160 --> 23:55.025
I either drop dead

23:55.060 --> 23:57.051
or I'm gonna
solve this.

23:58.600 --> 24:00.761
I've never really
been scared of anything

24:00.800 --> 24:02.097
in my...

24:02.140 --> 24:04.005
in my whole life,

24:04.040 --> 24:06.736
but this?

24:06.770 --> 24:08.738
I am scared of this.

24:08.780 --> 24:11.169
I'm not scared
of dying.

24:11.210 --> 24:12.609
I'm scared of

24:12.650 --> 24:14.914
losing my memory.

24:14.950 --> 24:16.918
Because
without it, I...

24:16.950 --> 24:18.941
Carrie...

24:18.990 --> 24:21.982
you are so much
more than your gift.

24:22.020 --> 24:23.851
Don't you
know that?

24:37.000 --> 24:39.139
Tell me you got something.

24:39.170 --> 24:40.706
I think I do.

24:40.740 --> 24:41.968
Take a look, Al.

24:42.010 --> 24:44.240
Okay, so you know how we think

24:44.280 --> 24:47.101
Nikos was targeting Linear Oil
Systems and their investors

24:47.150 --> 24:48.708
because of the oil spill?

24:48.750 --> 24:50.149
Right? I've been
sifting through

24:50.180 --> 24:51.181
CCTV footage from their offices.

24:51.220 --> 24:52.687
Turns out there was

24:52.720 --> 24:54.153
a "Save Nigeria"
rally right in front

24:54.190 --> 24:55.259
of the office
about a month ago.

24:55.290 --> 24:57.110
Guess who
I found?

24:57.160 --> 25:00.027
The guy standing
to the left of Nikos

25:00.060 --> 25:01.220
is a Nigerian national.

25:01.260 --> 25:03.228
His name is Goodacre Oyenusi.

25:03.260 --> 25:05.899
Now, apparently, this guy's
a notorious operator.

25:05.930 --> 25:08.194
Specializes in fake passports,
immigration papers...

25:08.240 --> 25:10.561
just like the ones
Nikos had in his hotel room.

25:10.610 --> 25:11.963
He likes
to spend

25:12.010 --> 25:13.637
his days hanging around

25:13.680 --> 25:15.079
this Nigerian restaurant
called Moin Moin.

25:15.110 --> 25:16.634
Shoot the address to my phone.

25:16.680 --> 25:18.170
Nice work, Jay!

25:24.150 --> 25:25.811
You feeling all right?

25:25.850 --> 25:27.886
Never better.
You don't look so hot.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.182
Oh, yeah, well,
that's the crappy

25:29.220 --> 25:30.619
fluorescent lighting in here.

25:30.660 --> 25:31.729
AL:
What about our deal?

25:31.760 --> 25:32.920
You're supposed to tell me

25:32.960 --> 25:34.097
when you don't
feel good.

25:34.130 --> 25:36.223
You know, I-I-I think
I'm losing my memory

25:36.260 --> 25:38.069
and I don't
really recall that.

25:38.100 --> 25:39.260
Yeah, that's
convenient.

25:51.310 --> 25:53.005
CARRIE:
You see what I'm seeing?

25:53.050 --> 25:54.972
AL:
Yeah, that's Oyenusi.

25:55.020 --> 25:56.976
Thinking the softer
approach is better here.

25:57.020 --> 25:59.909
Yeah.
I completely agree.

25:59.950 --> 26:01.178
Police!
Don't move!

26:01.220 --> 26:03.108
I dare you

26:03.160 --> 26:05.082
to test me.
I dare you.

26:05.130 --> 26:07.086
Sit your ass down
and stay there.

26:07.130 --> 26:09.257
Al... behind that curtain.

26:09.300 --> 26:11.894
I'm guessing it's not
the Wizard of Oz.

26:11.930 --> 26:13.989
How's the soup?

26:14.040 --> 26:15.234
Tasty.
Huh.

26:15.270 --> 26:16.294
AL:
All right, let's see.

26:16.340 --> 26:18.308
We got fake driver's licenses,

26:18.340 --> 26:20.262
birth certificates
from Qatar,

26:20.310 --> 26:22.198
blank social security cards...

26:22.240 --> 26:23.673
That has nothing to do with me.

26:23.710 --> 26:25.644
Show me your pockets.
Now!

26:31.090 --> 26:32.717
Oh, look at that.

26:32.750 --> 26:35.014
An expired work visa
for Carmen Naji.

26:35.060 --> 26:36.687
I don't know
anything about that.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.221
Let's go.

26:44.930 --> 26:46.898
What do you know of Ogoniland?

26:46.930 --> 26:49.694
Nothing.

26:49.740 --> 26:51.628
But I know you're a coward.

26:51.670 --> 26:53.262
You don't know me.

26:53.310 --> 26:55.335
You know nothing about me.

26:55.380 --> 26:57.302
ELIOT:
Ah, she looks terrible.

26:57.340 --> 26:58.773
I'm not liking this.

26:58.810 --> 27:00.300
Not at all.

27:01.820 --> 27:03.845
If a giant U.S. corporation

27:03.890 --> 27:06.142
came in and destroyed my family

27:06.190 --> 27:08.886
and my home,

27:08.920 --> 27:12.128
I'd want to do
something about it.

27:12.160 --> 27:14.025
Like murder?

27:14.060 --> 27:16.654
If you want to confess,
I got a pen.

27:16.700 --> 27:17.928
Okay.

27:19.370 --> 27:22.794
Write this down:

27:22.840 --> 27:25.729
If I could,

27:25.770 --> 27:27.260
I would strangle you

27:27.310 --> 27:29.175
and all the others

27:29.210 --> 27:31.849
who come to my country
and seduce my people

27:31.880 --> 27:34.371
with money and false promises.

27:36.750 --> 27:38.741
You're not a patriot.

27:40.190 --> 27:42.158
You think you are,
but you're not.

27:42.190 --> 27:44.852
You're a crook.

27:44.890 --> 27:46.289
You sell fake documents,

27:46.330 --> 27:48.321
you prey on poor people...

27:48.360 --> 27:49.725
you're sick.

27:49.760 --> 27:52.467
If you're looking for "sick,"

27:52.500 --> 27:55.435
look in the mirror.

27:55.470 --> 27:58.359
You are a disease.

27:58.410 --> 27:59.809
A poison.

27:59.840 --> 28:01.102
What did you say?

28:02.840 --> 28:05.400
Did you do this to me?

28:05.450 --> 28:06.303
Al...

28:06.350 --> 28:07.772
I'm on it.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.242
There are always your kind...

28:09.280 --> 28:10.918
My kind?

28:10.950 --> 28:13.248
Secret police
who don't wear uniforms,

28:13.290 --> 28:16.259
who hide behind names
like "corporate protection"

28:16.290 --> 28:17.951
and "security forces."

28:17.990 --> 28:20.788
You're all
the same.

28:20.830 --> 28:22.320
Security forces don't...

28:30.470 --> 28:32.062
I saw him.

28:34.240 --> 28:36.379
I saw his face.

28:52.260 --> 28:53.921
AL:
Take it easy.

28:55.930 --> 28:57.454
CARRIE:
What happened?

28:57.500 --> 28:58.592
You fainted.

28:58.630 --> 29:01.531
EMTs gave you something to
stabilize your blood pressure.

29:01.570 --> 29:02.992
How do you feel?

29:03.040 --> 29:05.429
Uh... Ifeel like an idiot.

29:06.570 --> 29:08.174
For fainting.

29:08.210 --> 29:09.404
Where's Goodacre?

29:09.440 --> 29:11.408
Being booked on
forgery and fraud.

29:11.450 --> 29:13.247
He's a crook,
but he's not our guy.

29:13.280 --> 29:14.372
How long was I out?

29:14.420 --> 29:15.910
About ten minutes.

29:15.950 --> 29:17.417
I was going to put
Triscuits on your forehead,

29:17.450 --> 29:18.917
like at New Year's that time.

29:21.320 --> 29:22.787
Um...

29:22.820 --> 29:24.856
We gotta...

29:24.890 --> 29:26.187
we-we gotta get going,

29:26.230 --> 29:28.221
because I-I...

29:28.260 --> 29:29.898
I saw his face.

29:29.930 --> 29:31.090
You remember the guy?

29:31.130 --> 29:32.392
Yeah, I saw his face.

29:32.430 --> 29:34.534
Something Goodacre said,
INIQWMm

29:34.570 --> 29:36.765
when I was
chasing Nikos.

29:37.570 --> 29:39.538
I know I saw him.

29:39.570 --> 29:41.572
Oh...
It's okay.

29:41.610 --> 29:43.840
No, no, no, no, it's not okay.

29:43.880 --> 29:44.904
It's not okay,

29:44.950 --> 29:46.577
because I...

29:46.610 --> 29:48.578
I saw him and
I can't remember him.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.918
And that thing you just said
about Triscuits at New Year's,

29:50.950 --> 29:51.939
I don't even_know
what you're talkIng about.

29:51.990 --> 29:53.241
I don't remember it.

29:53.290 --> 29:55.554
Carrie...
it's gonna be okay.

29:55.590 --> 29:57.285
Homobatrachotoxin.

29:57.320 --> 29:58.287
AL:
What?

29:59.630 --> 30:02.929
Amazonian hunters tip
their arrows in it.

30:02.960 --> 30:04.564
Our guy must have
had it on the cart.

30:04.600 --> 30:06.864
I put Dr. Miller
on it and I think

30:06.900 --> 30:08.060
we've come up
with an antidote.

30:08.100 --> 30:09.931
This is good.
WEBSTER:
We have no idea

30:09.970 --> 30:12.268
how much of that stuff
you absorbed.

30:12.310 --> 30:14.471
And the poison is so rare...

30:14.510 --> 30:15.932
Ooh, that's a big needle.

30:15.980 --> 30:16.969
Yeah.
Ooh, okay. Okay.

30:17.010 --> 30:18.307
Ah...

30:18.350 --> 30:20.409
§§$§

30:20.450 --> 30:21.576
CARRIE:
How long till it takes

30:21.620 --> 30:23.144
to work?
An hour,

30:23.180 --> 30:25.580
maybe two, but there
really is no data

30:25.620 --> 30:27.918
on the antidote, so...

30:27.960 --> 30:28.984
you may feel worse
before you feel better.

30:29.020 --> 30:31.420
If I wake up tomorrow,
we know it worked, right?

30:36.660 --> 30:38.628
AL_:
CarrIe.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.228
I don't care if we catch him.

30:40.270 --> 30:42.033
I do.

30:42.070 --> 30:44.004
No more jokes, no more dodges,

30:44.040 --> 30:45.405
no more walking out of rooms.

30:45.440 --> 30:47.408
I lost you before,
for nine years.

30:47.440 --> 30:49.908
All this: the job,
the city...

30:51.210 --> 30:52.609
...all of it.

30:52.650 --> 30:54.572
If you're not in it,
it's meaningless.

30:57.680 --> 30:59.147
Please...

30:59.190 --> 31:01.954
let me take you to the hospital.

31:01.990 --> 31:04.424
At least until we know
the antidote is working.

31:04.460 --> 31:07.281
I have to know
I did my best for you.

31:07.330 --> 31:10.094
You've always done
your best for me.

31:10.130 --> 31:12.462
And taking me to the hospital
won't prove that.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.099
Hey, guys.

31:16.140 --> 31:17.289
You want a room,
or, uh...

31:17.340 --> 31:18.637
you want to
catch a killer?

31:18.670 --> 31:20.331
Hmm...

31:20.370 --> 31:22.235
Since your memory's
gotten a little shaky,

31:22.280 --> 31:24.168
I've been trying to come up with
my own version of what you do.

31:24.210 --> 31:26.178
So I went back to the
Goodacre interview,

31:26.210 --> 31:28.019
and I looked at what
motivated you

31:28.050 --> 31:29.574
to turn and head for the door.

31:29.620 --> 31:31.144
You guys were talking about

31:31.190 --> 31:32.487
private military contractors.

31:32.520 --> 31:34.181
So I did a search of PMC's
in that region

31:34.220 --> 31:36.154
of Nigeria during the time
of the oil spill.

31:36.190 --> 31:38.249
This is what I found.

31:38.290 --> 31:40.155
It's Custom Forces!

31:47.070 --> 31:49.038
I-I saw a...

31:50.640 --> 31:52.528
No, I can't remember.

31:52.570 --> 31:54.231
They were in charge
of the security

31:54.280 --> 31:55.702
on the Linear Oil Systems
Nigerian project.

31:55.740 --> 31:57.537
Look who's on their board.

31:59.250 --> 32:00.569
AL:
So, all our victims

32:00.610 --> 32:03.215
were on Custom Forces'
board of dIrectors.

32:03.250 --> 32:04.683
Exactly.
And besides Senator Carlyle,

32:04.720 --> 32:07.985
there's only one member
that's still alive.

32:09.420 --> 32:11.183
AL:
The Honorable Logan Sale,
retired.

32:11.230 --> 32:12.583
JAY:
This guy's the chairman

32:12.630 --> 32:14.257
of the board,
and he only comes to town

32:14.300 --> 32:16.723
and goes to his office
one day out of the month.

32:16.760 --> 32:18.227
And it's today.

32:24.140 --> 32:26.267
My arm is killing me.

32:26.310 --> 32:28.107
That a symptom?

32:28.140 --> 32:31.041
No. Did you see the
size of that needle?

32:46.360 --> 32:48.248
MAN:
I understand your concern.

32:48.300 --> 32:49.995
You bet I was worried.

32:50.030 --> 32:52.089
Everybody in our circle is.
No offense.

32:52.130 --> 32:53.722
But we're running
out of time on this.

32:53.770 --> 32:55.465
I need you to tell us
everything you know

32:55.500 --> 32:57.161
about the Custom
Forces board.

32:57.200 --> 32:58.701
Rarely meets.

32:58.740 --> 33:01.038
Nothing controversial
in the work we do.

33:01.080 --> 33:04.675
Except for the Linear Oil
Systems disaster, right?

33:04.710 --> 33:06.200
That wasn't our problem.

33:06.250 --> 33:07.308
Hmm?
We protect

33:07.350 --> 33:09.113
sensitive locations
all over the world.

33:09.150 --> 33:10.344
We neither condemn nor condone

33:10.380 --> 33:12.348
what goes on in those locations.

33:12.390 --> 33:14.756
Now I think I'm gonna be sick.

33:14.790 --> 33:16.382
This is why we keep
the work we do hidden.

33:16.420 --> 33:17.682
It's misunderstood.

33:27.300 --> 33:29.188
Are you okay?

33:29.240 --> 33:32.061
Um...

33:32.110 --> 33:33.259
yeah.

33:33.310 --> 33:34.504
I just need to get
some water or something.

33:34.540 --> 33:36.303
Uh... do you...?

33:36.340 --> 33:38.103
Where's the ladies' room?

33:38.150 --> 33:39.549
To the right
as you go out the door.

33:39.580 --> 33:42.140
Thanks.

33:42.180 --> 33:44.182
AL:
Excuse me.

33:45.750 --> 33:47.342
I'm going with you.

33:47.390 --> 33:48.618
What?

33:48.660 --> 33:50.412
No, Al. Come on.

33:50.460 --> 33:52.621
I think I'm old enough
to go pee-pee by myself.

33:52.660 --> 33:54.298
Not like this you're not.

33:54.330 --> 33:55.524
All right, listen.
This isn't Cavanaugh's.

33:55.560 --> 33:57.198
And it's not a Tuesday night.

33:57.230 --> 33:58.629
You remember Cavanaugh's?

33:59.730 --> 34:01.789
Yeah.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.796
I do.

34:03.840 --> 34:05.205
After Truth or Dare, we, uh,

34:05.240 --> 34:07.367
we went to the bathroom
and we made out.

34:07.410 --> 34:10.538
Boy, we really...
we really made out.

34:10.580 --> 34:12.241
It's working! The antidote.

34:12.280 --> 34:13.372
What day was it?

34:13.410 --> 34:14.513
Um...

34:16.820 --> 34:18.344
Summer.

34:18.390 --> 34:19.345
It was summer?
Mm...

34:19.390 --> 34:20.345
I'm going with you.

34:20.390 --> 34:21.687
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

34:23.490 --> 34:26.323
June 13, 2000.

34:26.360 --> 34:28.499
We forgot to lock
the bathroom door.

34:28.530 --> 34:30.498
And it didn't matter.
No.

34:30.530 --> 34:32.623
All right.

34:32.670 --> 34:33.728
I'm gonna go by myself.

34:33.770 --> 34:35.237
Okay. Hey?

34:35.270 --> 34:37.795
You sure you don't
want some company?

34:37.840 --> 34:40.229
Maybe after this is over.

34:40.270 --> 34:41.476
It's a date.

34:41.510 --> 34:43.501
Yeah.

34:45.550 --> 34:48.348
SALE:
You know,
now that you bring it up,

34:48.380 --> 34:49.278
there was one thing

34:49.320 --> 34:52.187
tied to the Nigerian operation
that was odd.

34:52.220 --> 34:54.279
We had to fire our top
supervisor in the field.

34:54.320 --> 34:56.652
And he didn't take it very well.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.555
August Kincaid, former CIA.

35:03.600 --> 35:06.296
Old-school spook, full of
himself, but very effective.

35:06.330 --> 35:08.298
He just lost control
one too many times,

35:08.340 --> 35:10.262
especially in and around
the Nigerian situation,

35:10.300 --> 35:11.904
so we had to fire him.

35:11.940 --> 35:13.669
He was belligerent
and upset.

35:13.710 --> 35:15.678
The-the job was
his entire life.

35:15.710 --> 35:17.302
It was like we took
everything from him.

35:17.340 --> 35:18.477
Not healthy.

35:18.510 --> 35:19.602
So this isn't about

35:19.650 --> 35:21.277
an oil spill or Nigeria at all.

35:21.320 --> 35:22.639
This is about a guy
with a grudge.

35:22.680 --> 35:26.389
A very dangerous guy
with a grudge.

35:34.260 --> 35:36.455
Okay.

36:18.910 --> 36:21.276
Hello?

36:21.310 --> 36:23.403
Um...

36:23.440 --> 36:24.941
how you doing?

36:24.980 --> 36:27.301
I'm good. I'm fine. Thanks.

36:27.350 --> 36:28.942
You know you're
in the men's room, right?
Yeah.

36:28.980 --> 36:31.540
Didn't make it
to the ladies' room. Sorry.

36:31.590 --> 36:32.614
Little hung over?

36:32.650 --> 36:34.288
No. No.

36:34.320 --> 36:35.457
Something you ate?

36:35.490 --> 36:37.355
Listen, I'm a...

36:37.390 --> 36:38.459
sandwich vendor
on this floor.

36:38.490 --> 36:40.287
I got a bottle
of seltzer in my cooler.

36:40.330 --> 36:42.457
I don't think seltzer's
gonna ﬁx what I got.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.263
But thanks.

36:44.300 --> 36:45.460
You know?

36:45.500 --> 36:47.263
You look familiar.

36:47.300 --> 36:49.530
Uh...

36:49.570 --> 36:50.730
Have we met?

36:50.770 --> 36:54.376
I don't think so. No.

36:54.410 --> 36:56.378
No, I'm-I'm pretty sure.

36:56.410 --> 36:59.447
I mean, a lady like you
makes an impression.

36:59.480 --> 37:02.017
Are you hitting on me
while I'm about to throw up

37:02.050 --> 37:03.972
in a sink in a men's bathroom?

37:04.020 --> 37:05.544
Are you really...?
Are

37:05.590 --> 37:07.911
Come on, man, that's...
Sorry.

37:07.950 --> 37:09.486
Sorry.

37:09.520 --> 37:11.454
At least let me get you
a bottle of water.

37:11.490 --> 37:13.253
I'm really, I'm fine.

37:13.290 --> 37:15.997
No problem at all.

37:16.030 --> 37:18.419
Important to keep
yourself hydrated.

37:22.440 --> 37:24.499
Yeah.

37:32.410 --> 37:34.446
Ooh.
Number one cure
for what ails you.

37:37.720 --> 37:38.914
Hey...

37:38.950 --> 37:40.781
You okay?

37:44.490 --> 37:47.425
Hey, you okay?

37:51.330 --> 37:53.264
Oh, come on now.

37:54.700 --> 37:56.759
You're playing me?
In your condition?

37:56.800 --> 37:59.769
Bad luck for you.

37:59.810 --> 38:01.937
I didn't mean to dose you,
but what could I do?

38:01.980 --> 38:03.504
You should've let
my partner go.

38:47.550 --> 38:49.859
You're done, Kincaid.

38:55.530 --> 38:57.589
Who are you?

38:57.630 --> 39:00.565
Carrie. It's me-- Al.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.488
Got you.

39:13.180 --> 39:15.648
(indistinct announcement
over intercom)

39:22.160 --> 39:23.684
Hey.

39:23.720 --> 39:25.859
So, they are gonna
keep you overnight.

39:25.890 --> 39:27.778
Just to be sure.
Aw!

39:27.830 --> 39:29.388
That sucks!

39:29.430 --> 39:31.489
They don't even have Jell-O.

39:31.530 --> 39:33.589
"Jell
: Yeah.

39:33.630 --> 39:35.131
It's a long story.
Well, the short version

39:35.170 --> 39:37.491
is that when I was a girl,
my mom had appendicitis,

39:37.540 --> 39:39.132
they put her in the hospital,
and every night

39:39.170 --> 39:40.535
they would give her these,
you know,

39:40.570 --> 39:42.003
these little packages of Jell-O.

39:42.040 --> 39:44.031
And I would steal them.
And I would eat them.

39:44.080 --> 39:46.844
And basically it became
a lifelong craving.

39:46.880 --> 39:49.644
Mm-hmm.
I never knew that about you.

39:49.680 --> 39:50.942
Well...

39:50.980 --> 39:53.483
some of the most
sacred memorIes,

39:53.520 --> 39:57.149
it takes a while to reveal them
even to the person you love.

40:11.840 --> 40:14.877
Wow.

40:14.910 --> 40:16.730
You know, with kisses like that

40:16.780 --> 40:19.044
I'm really glad
I didn't lose my memory.

40:19.080 --> 40:22.049
Because I will be able
to play that in my head

40:22.080 --> 40:25.948
over and over.

40:27.590 --> 40:29.581
* Blackbird singing
in the dead of night... *

40:29.620 --> 40:31.053
No, no, what are you
still doing here?

40:31.090 --> 40:32.728
We're headed
over to Alonzo's.

40:32.760 --> 40:35.558
Just updating
some new protocols.
Jay,

40:35.600 --> 40:37.192
we caught an international
assassin and Carrie

40:37.230 --> 40:39.198
is still alive.
You can go home early today.

40:39.230 --> 40:40.822
You talk to Al?
How's she doing?

40:40.870 --> 40:42.167
She's doing good.

40:42.200 --> 40:44.839
That was a close one, huh, boss?

40:44.870 --> 40:46.462
Close enough for a beer.

40:46.510 --> 40:47.738
On me.

40:47.770 --> 40:48.907
Okay.

40:48.940 --> 40:50.669
_ Hold on-- _
foreIgn or domestIc?

40:50.710 --> 40:53.599
Let's go.

40:53.650 --> 40:56.118
Okay.

40:58.020 --> 40:59.942
That's foreign and domestic?

40:59.990 --> 41:02.083
'Cause a beer
is a different thing.

41:02.120 --> 41:03.781
Excuse me, I'm looking
for Detective Wells.

41:03.820 --> 41:04.980
Uh, well, I'm her boss.

41:05.030 --> 41:06.520
How can I help you?
Oh,

41:06.560 --> 41:07.822
pleased to meet you.
Eddie Martin.

41:07.860 --> 41:08.997
I'm her husband.

41:17.670 --> 41:19.809
Look what I got.

41:19.840 --> 41:23.708
No, no, where'd
you get this?

41:23.740 --> 41:25.708
I told 'em I got
a girl upstairs

41:25.750 --> 41:28.275
needs her Jell-O ASAP.

41:28.310 --> 41:29.641
I pulled the badge.

41:29.680 --> 41:30.874
You did not. Did you?

41:30.920 --> 41:32.512
I did not.
I went

41:32.550 --> 41:34.017
across the street to the deli.

41:34.050 --> 41:36.951
You're very sweet,
you know that?

41:36.990 --> 41:40.653
Well, I didn't want
the moment to slip away.

41:40.690 --> 41:42.829
Moment's not going anywhere.

41:42.860 --> 41:44.669
To the moments.

41:44.700 --> 41:45.792
All of them.

41:49.870 --> 41:52.668
Want to see this?
Choking on Jell

41:52.710 --> 41:53.802
Can't choke,
here... No...

41:53.840 --> 41:55.728
You... will you
do one shot of it?

41:55.780 --> 41:58.749
* Take these broken wings
and learn to fly *

41:58.780 --> 41:59.804
What do you mean...
No, you got to suck it.

41:59.850 --> 42:03.809
* All your life

42:03.850 --> 42:08.787
* You were only waiting
for this moment to arise *

42:08.820 --> 42:14.827
* You were only waiting for
this moment to arise... *
