I think you should find a partner.

17:58.536 --> 17:59.378
What?

17:59.537 --> 18:02.541
Well, consider competing.
I think it might...

18:02.582 --> 18:03.582
Calm you down.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.294
Be good if you had a focus.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.968
And skating with someone,
that'd be even better.

18:10.339 --> 18:13.889
Cos it'd mean you'd have another person
to share all your feelings with.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.228
About being on the ice.

18:18.639 --> 18:21.893
You need to find a girl,
Chris, I'm certain.

18:26.397 --> 18:27.397
He's like Hitler.

18:28.065 --> 18:29.942
He's like Hitler in ice skates.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.407
I told him last week.

18:32.987 --> 18:34.881
He maintains I weren't getting my leg up
high enough

18:34.905 --> 18:38.034
when we was coming out the chasse,
and it was basically a goose step.

18:38.242 --> 18:40.619
So I said, "There's a reason,
Christopher Dean",

18:40.620 --> 18:42.122
that you can do this and I can't."

18:42.496 --> 18:43.543
But it never clicked.

18:44.206 --> 18:46.629
I don't think he's the sharpest tool
in the box, you know?

18:53.382 --> 18:54.725
Hey! That's another thing.

18:54.800 --> 18:58.395
How can he, coming from there,
tell me I've got no artistry?

18:58.596 --> 19:00.348
And I don't interpret the music?

19:04.769 --> 19:06.191

I do.

Has he, uh... tried it on yet?

19:20.201 --> 19:22.078
- I bet he has!
- No.

19:23.621 --> 19:25.123
We need to sort that out then.

like a launch pad.

just like I'm prepared to admit

that what we're doing now...

There's no joy to it, Chris.
There's no feeling.

01:12:44.318 --> 01:12:48.164

Cos you won't tell me what's wrong.

01:13:40.541 --> 01:13:42.543
Because every second
that I'm out on that ice

01:13:42.793 --> 01:13:48.300
I'm holding back a bloody great tide of...
of the real world.

01:13:48.925 --> 01:13:51.974
Where we wallow in shit, and we get bored

01:13:52.011 --> 01:13:55.436

unsatisfying

01:13:55.473 --> 01:13:57.100
and, and unremarkable.

01:13:57.141 --> 01:13:59.269

to put my efforts into making something

that whenever you let your guard down

whenever you let someone close to you,
whenever you love them...

make it better.

OK, it's one rhythm that builds
and it builds into this incredible climax

01:16:45.184 --> 01:16:46.703
and we could dance in and out of the beat

01:16:46.727 --> 01:16:50.402

sinewy throb.

lifting stuff, you're right

so now we do the opposite.

they die in each other's arms.

01:22:06.171 --> 01:22:07.889
(KNOCK ON DOOR) Miss Torvill?

01:22:08.549 --> 01:22:09.549
Phone call.

01:22:21.186 --> 01:22:23.609
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)

01:22:38.287 --> 01:22:39.287
Chris.

01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:41.207
Been knocking on your door.

01:22:41.415 --> 01:22:43.759
Why aren't you in bed?
I thought something had happened.

01:22:43.876 --> 01:22:47.881
Sleep? Bloody hell, Jayne, it's tomorrow.

01:22:48.547 --> 01:22:49.844
Everything is tomorrow.

01:22:50.924 --> 01:22:52.597
How many sugars have you got in there?

01:22:54.052 --> 01:22:55.269
You got to calm down.

01:22:55.304 --> 01:22:56.304
Yeah“.

01:22:56.638 --> 01:22:57.639
Yeah, you're right.

01:23:01.935 --> 01:23:03.608
So how come you came looking for me?

01:23:04.688 --> 01:23:06.656
Nothing's happened, has it? No.

01:23:07.858 --> 01:23:08.858
I mean...

01:23:09.943 --> 01:23:12.787
Me mum's coming out.
I got a call from her just now.

01:23:12.988 --> 01:23:14.456
- What?
- Daily Mail.

01:23:14.490 --> 01:23:16.993
They heard she was manning the fort
back in Nottingham

01:23:17.284 --> 01:23:19.262
so they arranged for someone to go in
and replace her

01:23:19.286 --> 01:23:21.582
and they're flying her out.
And she's agreed, has she?

01:23:21.583 --> 01:23:22.957
They even negotiated.

01:23:23.415 --> 01:23:26.885
Said, they had to refund me
Dad's coach ticket

01:23:26.919 --> 01:23:30.389
and arrange it so that he could jet back
with her afterwards.

01:23:34.927 --> 01:23:36.429
They want your mum to come too.

01:23:38.805 --> 01:23:40.728
That's the angle. Sort of.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:45.571
Two adoring mothers in
situ at the 11th hour.

01:23:48.398 --> 01:23:49.866
She turned 'em down, don't worry.

01:23:51.026 --> 01:23:52.026
Good.

01:23:52.194 --> 01:23:54.037
They asked my mum to try and persuade her.

01:23:54.613 --> 01:23:56.581
She couldn't make her
change her mind anyway.

01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:58.537
She said she didn't wanna put you off.

01:23:59.826 --> 01:24:00.826
My mum said that?

01:24:02.204 --> 01:24:04.047
- Tell her she can come.
- What?

01:24:05.624 --> 01:24:06.625
That's the number.

01:24:07.543 --> 01:24:08.920
They gave it Betty, ring her.

01:24:08.961 --> 01:24:10.258
- No.
- Why?

01:24:10.462 --> 01:24:11.462
Because.

01:24:12.839 --> 01:24:14.136
You know, I told you.

01:24:14.174 --> 01:24:15.016
She...

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:16.050
She what?

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:18.637
She got caught up in something horrible

01:24:19.263 --> 01:24:25.066
and the only way she could cope
was cutting herself off from everything.

01:24:27.062 --> 01:24:28.062
And...

01:24:29.481 --> 01:24:30.733
she's your mum, Chris.

01:24:30.774 --> 01:24:32.071
And she loves you.

01:24:33.068 --> 01:24:34.411
That's all that matters.

01:24:39.741 --> 01:24:41.163
That's what I think, anyway.

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:04.774
You're really gonna do this
then, aren't you?

01:25:05.058 --> 01:25:07.527
We need to make sure. One more time.

01:25:08.186 --> 01:25:09.608
At half four in the morning?

01:25:47.643 --> 01:25:50.522
Then we come back to centre
and you drop your behind leg.

01:25:53.357 --> 01:25:54.199
That's it.

01:25:54.232 --> 01:25:56.280
Got it. And finish on the flip over.

01:25:56.318 --> 01:25:57.820
(APPLAUSE)

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:11.417
See you later then.

01:26:12.167 --> 01:26:13.167
Oh, yeah.

01:26:15.212 --> 01:26:16.212
We're all set.

01:26:18.215 --> 01:26:19.215
Yeah.

01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:04.510
Betty!

01:27:05.095 --> 01:27:06.095
There you are.

01:28:43.819 --> 01:28:44.819
Good luck.

01:28:58.375 --> 01:28:59.375

01:29:00.502 --> 01:29:01.502
George!

01:29:09.594 --> 01:29:10.874
BETTY DAWSON: Oh, there's Betty.

01:29:13.807 --> 01:29:15.059
(GEORGE SNEEZES)

01:29:26.236 --> 01:29:28.364
I know Jayne Torvill.

01:29:30.949 --> 01:29:32.166
I used to work with her.

01:29:32.909 --> 01:29:35.082
Always got on really well.

01:30:03.899 --> 01:30:05.242
WOMAN: Miss Torvill, please.

01:30:12.073 --> 01:30:13.073
Mr Dean, sir.

(AUDIENCE WHISTLES AND MURMURS)

01:32:14.988 --> 01:32:16.740
What are you doing?
We never do that.

01:32:18.742 --> 01:32:19.742
You and me.

01:32:21.244 --> 01:32:22.244
Forever.
