sever that connection,

Lucifer entrusted the sword

to the Morgenstern family,

35:59.880 --> 36:01.120
I got lucky.

36:01.120 --> 36:02.960
Luck had nothing to do with it.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.210
What you did today,

36:05.210 --> 36:07.500
putting your life on the line
for the people you care about?

36:09.460 --> 36:11.080
It's pretty badass.

36:14.380 --> 36:15.620
You're pretty badass too.

36:23.920 --> 36:24.920
Don't.

36:28.710 --> 36:30.250
What's wrong, Jace?

36:30.250 --> 36:31.790
Are you jealous of our bond?

36:32.790 --> 36:34.460
I feel nothing towards you.

36:37.620 --> 36:39.330
We found a way to destroy
the Twinning Rune.

36:41.170 --> 36:43.000
You won't be
down here much longer.

36:44.210 --> 36:45.540
No.

36:45.540 --> 36:47.880
It's not possible.
JACE: It's more than possible.

36:47.880 --> 36:49.500
It's inevitable.

36:51.210 --> 36:52.210
No.

36:53.580 --> 36:55.250
You won't do it. I have so much
more to share with you.

36:56.250 --> 36:57.540
I'm your brother.

36:57.540 --> 36:59.330
Clary, don't let them do this!

36:59.330 --> 37:01.000
You almost killed my brother.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.330
You killed
a dozen Shadowhunters.

37:03.330 --> 37:04.380
People I trained with.

37:05.580 --> 37:07.460
She wants you gone just as much
as the rest of us.

37:07.460 --> 37:09.120
LET HER SPEAK!

37:11.460 --> 37:13.120
I'm sorry, Jonathan.

37:14.540 --> 37:16.330
I'm sorry.

37:16.330 --> 37:18.250
This is the way it has to be.

37:20.120 --> 37:21.500
No...

37:21.500 --> 37:23.000
No!

37:25.040 --> 37:26.750
Lilith was right.

37:27.750 --> 37:29.750
No one's ever coming for me,
are they?

37:30.960 --> 37:33.120
You were supposed
to be my princess.

37:35.540 --> 37:36.880
Clary?

37:40.210 --> 37:42.000
CLARY!

37:42.920 --> 37:45.170
CLARY, DON'T LEAVE ME!

37:45.170 --> 37:46.170
CLARY!

37:46.170 --> 37:48.920
PLEASE, DON'T LEAVE ME!

37:48.920 --> 37:50.750
CLARY!

37:50.750 --> 37:52.750
CLARY!

You know, I really love

38:31.250 --> 38:32.790
this pre-war architecture,

38:32.790 --> 38:34.290
it is just gorgeous.

38:34.290 --> 38:35.290
Just like you.

38:39.250 --> 38:40.710
Have you been drinking?

38:40.710 --> 38:43.000
Well... apparently, I lost

38:43.000 --> 38:45.380
my warlock tolerance for booze,

38:45.380 --> 38:47.000
and... hmm.

38:48.790 --> 38:50.080
How much have you had?

38:50.080 --> 38:51.420
A lot.

38:51.420 --> 38:53.330
Why? Are you judging me?

38:53.330 --> 38:55.960
No. I'm just... concerned.

38:55.960 --> 38:57.330
I've never seen you like this.

38:57.330 --> 38:59.000
No. Neither have I.

39:00.750 --> 39:02.580
Did something happen?

39:02.580 --> 39:04.210
Oh, you didn't hear?

39:04.210 --> 39:06.380
I lost my magic.

39:06.380 --> 39:08.420
Twice! (GIGGLING)

39:08.420 --> 39:10.080
And I'm just coming to terms

39:10.080 --> 39:11.380
with how useless
I am without it.

39:11.380 --> 39:12.580
Magnus, you're not useless.

39:12.580 --> 39:14.000
Oh, easy for you to say.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.710
You're at the top of your game

39:15.710 --> 39:17.000
with an institute
of Shadowhunters

39:17.000 --> 39:18.460
at your beck and call. Me?

39:18.460 --> 39:20.290
Well, I'm just a has-been
warlock who isn't good

39:20.290 --> 39:24.210
for anything, except
comic relief... and drinking.

39:25.670 --> 39:27.880
But hey, I'm
a mundane now, right?

39:27.880 --> 39:29.540
Just like you've always wanted.

39:33.500 --> 39:35.460
All I've ever wanted
is for you to be happy.

39:35.460 --> 39:36.750
Well, I'm not!

39:44.960 --> 39:46.290
What am I doing?

39:46.290 --> 39:48.710
You put this beautiful
night together

39:48.710 --> 39:50.250
and I am picking a fight.

39:51.380 --> 39:53.330
It's pathetic.

39:55.290 --> 39:56.830
It's OK.

39:56.830 --> 39:59.420
You're just... you're going
through a hard time.

39:59.420 --> 40:01.120
Please, Alexander.

40:02.250 --> 40:04.710
Don't make me pretend
this is just a phase.

40:06.460 --> 40:07.460
Because it's not.

40:07.460 --> 40:10.380
What I'm feeling now...

40:12.000 --> 40:13.790
...it may never pass.

40:15.040 --> 40:16.710
For as long as I live.

40:22.040 --> 40:23.540
I should go.

40:23.540 --> 40:25.250
I've probably killed
both of our appetites.

40:25.250 --> 40:26.620
Stop. Stop. Listen.

40:26.620 --> 40:28.420
Magnus, I love you.
Can you just,

40:28.420 --> 40:29.540
I just want to help.

40:29.540 --> 40:31.330
I know you do. But you can't.
OK, listen.

40:31.330 --> 40:32.880
You have to just stop!
Alec, let me go!

40:32.880 --> 40:34.420
Please, stop. Just listen to me.
You can't help me, Alec!

40:34.420 --> 40:36.460
Listen to me for a second!
Listen to me!

40:36.460 --> 40:37.830
Just let me be here with you!
You can't!

40:37.830 --> 40:39.330
ALEC!

40:39.330 --> 40:42.380
Please... please...
