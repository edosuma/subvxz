WEBVTT

00:01.210 --> 00:02.666
Guys, I'm not gonna lie.

00:02.961 --> 00:05.623
It has been one hell
of a month for old Pen.

00:05.923 --> 00:08.085
Broken engage,
infested condo,

00:08.383 --> 00:09.839
Glenn Beck put his
fingers in my mouth.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.546
That's the last time

00:11.845 --> 00:12.459
we go to one of his
book signings ironically.

00:12.763 --> 00:14.970
Yeah. Ironically.

00:15.265 --> 00:17.256
But I do wanna thank my
temporary roomies Brad and Jane

00:17.559 --> 00:19.015
for your hospitality,
your support,

00:19.311 --> 00:21.348
and your vast collection
of cashmere throws.

00:21.647 --> 00:23.888
Cotton irritates
my Nipsey Russells.

00:24.191 --> 00:26.728
Hey, watch your mouth when you're
talking about the fabric of our lives.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.734
| think I've earned the
right to talk about cotton

00:29.029 --> 00:30.269
any way
| damn well please.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.279
| believe you have, sir.

00:32.573 --> 00:34.531
I'm secretly glad that your
exterminator's taking so long.

00:34.826 --> 00:35.987
It's been so nice
having you stay with us.

00:36.286 --> 00:38.368
We're like a... A
little family. Yeah!

00:38.664 --> 00:40.246
Yeah, Brad's the dad,
Jane's the mom,

00:40.541 --> 00:43.533
and Penny's the little baby
with the thick knockers.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.075
Which she clearly got
from my side of the family.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.416
Hey.
What?

00:47.714 --> 00:49.079
She got them big thangs.
You got them bee stings.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.418
Yeah, I do.

00:50.717 --> 00:51.206
Bzz!
All right.

00:53.011 --> 00:53.751
(BRAD AND JANE MOANING)
ALEX: Ugh. Stop.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.169
Hey, Penny!

00:55.472 --> 00:56.803
Hey, Shaun!

00:57.099 --> 00:58.589
Hey, I wanna apologize for
that workout mix | gave you.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.257
There was way too much
better than Ezra on there.

01:00.561 --> 01:01.892
No, it was great.

01:02.187 --> 01:03.552
| didn't even know they
had more than one song.

01:03.855 --> 01:04.720
All right, cool. I'll see
you in cardio sculpt?

01:05.022 --> 01:06.184
Cardio sculpt?

01:06.483 --> 01:07.848
| hope to. Bye.
All right, bye.

01:08.151 --> 01:10.563
Oh. Who was that slice
of peach pie?

01:10.862 --> 01:12.899
Cute, right?
Suh kyut, Penny.

01:13.198 --> 01:14.563
| mean, you should
take him to Bone Town.

01:14.866 --> 01:17.028
You know that rib joint on
Halsted? | love that place.

01:17.327 --> 01:19.409
| don't know.
He asked me out, but...

01:19.705 --> 01:21.662
| don't think I'm ready
for another relationship yet.

01:21.957 --> 01:23.698
| mean, this whole Pete thing
has been such a roller coaster.

01:24.001 --> 01:25.742
Ups, downs, barfing.

01:26.044 --> 01:28.206
| just... I'm still
pretty bummed out.

01:28.505 --> 01:29.620
| know you are,
sweetie,

01:29.923 --> 01:32.506
but no one's talking about
a relationship, okay?

01:32.801 --> 01:35.338
You need a fling,
nothing serious.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.799
(GASPS) I have got it.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.430
| am gonna host a no
pressure, double dinner date

01:40.726 --> 01:42.467
for you and Shaun
at our place.

01:42.769 --> 01:43.474
And like five out
of five frat guys,

01:43.770 --> 01:45.101
| am not gonna take
no for an answer.

01:45.397 --> 01:47.889
ALL: Do it! Do it!
Do it! Do it!

01:48.191 --> 01:50.057
All right! Okay!
Okay! Okay!

I'll call him. Do it!
Do it! Do it! Do...

01:51.320 --> 01:52.651
Thank you.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.937
Guys, put your wallets
away... JANE: Mmm?

01:55.240 --> 01:56.526
Because this dinner

01:56.825 --> 01:57.690

02:00.579 --> 02:01.319
Run!

02:05.917 --> 02:09.205
Guys, what part of "Dinner's
on me, flawless diversion, run”

02:09.503 --> 02:10.664
did you not
understand?

02:10.964 --> 02:13.001
Dude, you can't dine
and dash at Rosalita's.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.665
We come here, like,
six times a day.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.676
(SIGHS) I know. | am just,
like, hella broke right now.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.587
Just droppin' off

02:19.890 --> 02:21.881
(COINS CLINKING)

02:22.184 --> 02:23.720
Dude, you gotta
get a job.

02:24.019 --> 02:25.930

I'm gonna get a job.

02:26.229 --> 02:28.891
| just need to borrow,
like, a thousand dollars

02:29.191 --> 02:30.556
for my resume. (LOWERED
VOICE) And rent.

02:30.859 --> 02:31.940
(NORMAL VOICE)
And a business formal tie.

02:32.235 --> 02:33.817
(LOWERED VOICE)
And beer.

02:34.112 --> 02:34.567
(NORMAL VOICE) And
transportation to a job interview.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.149
(LOWERED VOICE)
And a frog costume.

02:36.448 --> 02:37.938
Frog costume? Oh,

02:38.241 --> 02:38.981
(BILLS RUSTLING) |

02:54.091 --> 02:55.206
Knock, knock, Jane!

02:55.509 --> 02:57.125
(TRILLS)
Brad delivery service.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.213
We pick that sweet ass up
and bring that sweet ass home.

03:00.389 --> 03:01.879
Oh.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.173
Uh, Mr. Sarofsky.

03:04.476 --> 03:06.217
Sorry. Jane said there
was a luna bar in here.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.227
| need the estrogen. I'm trying to
get rid of the stubble on my back.

03:08.522 --> 03:09.728
Uch! I mean, cool.

03:10.816 --> 03:13.274
So how's...
How's the missus?

03:13.568 --> 03:14.979
Oh. (CHUCKLES) Candice?
Yeah.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.986
She's great...
At being a huge bitch.

03:18.281 --> 03:19.737
She kicked me
out of the house, Brad,

03:20.033 --> 03:22.491
and now she's slapping me
in the face with a big D.

03:22.786 --> 03:24.493
I'm sorry?
Divorce.

03:24.788 --> 03:26.495
Oh! (LAUGHS)
Wow.

03:26.790 --> 03:29.248
Um, listen, I'm sorry
to hear that, man.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.783
Look, if you ever
wanna talk...

03:31.086 --> 03:32.668
Yeah, I do. That'd be
great. How about tonight?

03:32.963 --> 03:34.328
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Uh...

03:36.049 --> 03:37.210
(NORMAL VOICE)
Dinner party.

03:37.509 --> 03:39.250
Jane and I have a
dinner party tonight, SO...

03:39.553 --> 03:41.089
(INHALES DEEPLY)
All right.

03:41.388 --> 03:42.128
Well, I'll just
hang out here anyway,

03:43.348 --> 03:44.838
probably sleep
in a Corolla.

03:45.976 --> 03:47.216
All alone,

03:47.519 --> 03:48.429
by myself,

03:49.271 --> 03:50.727
crying like a baby

03:51.022 --> 03:52.228
trapped in a well.

03:52.524 --> 03:53.480
Do you wanna join us
for dinner?

03:53.775 --> 03:55.812
Does the Car Czar have a
camera in the women's bathroom?

03:56.111 --> 03:57.852
No, I do not
and would not,

03:58.155 --> 03:59.941
but, yeah, | wanna
come over for dinner.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.402
Right on. Hey,
boo. I'm ready to go.

04:02.701 --> 04:05.534
Great. Uh, a tiny
adorable addendum.

04:05.829 --> 04:08.241
(INHALES SHARPLY) Car
Czar's coming over for dinner.

04:08.540 --> 04:09.655
(VOICE RAISES PITCH)
Isn't that great?

04:09.958 --> 04:10.868
(HIGH-PITCHED LAUGH)

04:11.168 --> 04:11.748
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Uh...

04:18.550 --> 04:19.880
'Sup, shmorons.

04:20.177 --> 04:21.666
Happy now?

04:21.970 --> 04:23.176
What do you mean? And
how did you get in here?

04:23.472 --> 04:24.633
And why are you
wearing my robe?

04:24.931 --> 04:27.468
(MOUTH FULL) I have keys,
and I refuse to explain the robe.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.384
You guys remember how
you were on me to get a job?

04:29.686 --> 04:31.347
Well, I found an even better
way to make some money.

04:31.646 --> 04:33.011
(PAPER SLIDES)

04:33.315 --> 04:36.148
I'm gonna be a contestant
in Mr. Super Gay Chicago.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.354
Happy now?

04:38.653 --> 04:39.768
Oh, that's where
that "happy now?" goes.

04:40.071 --> 04:42.028
Mr. What?
Super gay where?

04:42.324 --> 04:44.440
The super gay pageant they
have every year at Rosalita's.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.484
Grand prize
is 1,000 bucks.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.369
What better way
to make some cash

04:48.663 --> 04:50.654
than a high-risk, unpredictable,
subjective contest?

04:50.957 --> 04:52.698
| mean, it's foolproof.

04:53.001 --> 04:56.164
Max, when we said "Get a
job," this is not what we meant.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.704
This is so much better!
It's awesome!

04:59.007 --> 05:00.372
And I can totally
help you.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.757
| have seen every episode
of Toddlers & Tiaras,

05:03.053 --> 05:04.760
Pageant Kings, Baby
Queens, and King of Queens.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.216
That last one is just a pageant
of comedy where everyone wins.

05:06.515 --> 05:07.346
Of course.

05:07.641 --> 05:08.972
And I can help, too.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.928
When I was a kid, | was
regional champ at Junior Mister,

05:11.228 --> 05:12.593
the young
gentlemen's pageant.

05:12.896 --> 05:13.510
You were in pageants
as a kid?

05:13.814 --> 05:14.929
Uh, correction, Officer.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.098
| won pageants
as a young adult.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.357

Thanks, guys.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.115
We have a lot
of work to do.

05:29.913 --> 05:32.029
(LOWERED VOICE) How could
you invite the Car Czar over?

05:32.332 --> 05:34.915
He's clearly drunk and ruining
Shaun and Penny's date.

05:35.210 --> 05:36.496
I'm sorry. When I'm in
an awkward situation,

05:36.795 --> 05:38.251
| panic and invite people
to things...

05:38.547 --> 05:39.958
Like when I invited that
mall Santa to our wedding.

05:40.257 --> 05:41.292
Oh, yeah. | can't forget
Darryl. Don't worry.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.167
Who's hungry?

05:45.470 --> 05:48.428
Whoa! Janie... (CHUCKLES)
Where's the meat course?

05:48.723 --> 05:51.090
Huh? So far it feels like this
dinner's been catered by Moby.

05:51.393 --> 05:52.303
(LAUGHING)

05:54.271 --> 05:55.477
Boom!

05:55.772 --> 05:57.433
It is a vegetarian meal
for Shaun,

05:57.732 --> 06:00.315
the guest we wanted
and therefore invited.

06:00.610 --> 06:03.773
Now, Shaun, what were you saying
about complete proteins again?

06:04.072 --> 06:05.483
You can get all the amino acids
you need from a rice-bean combo.

06:05.782 --> 06:06.772
Oh, Shaun!

06:07.075 --> 06:07.985
(LAUGHING)

06:09.119 --> 06:11.861
Shaun! Come on!

06:12.163 --> 06:13.619
Meat is what
makes your meat work.

06:13.915 --> 06:14.700
(LOWERED VOICE)
Oh, God.

06:15.000 --> 06:15.785
(LAUGHS) Okay.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.745
Shaun, listen.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.627
| get the whole
double date thing, okay?

06:20.922 --> 06:23.254
And I don't wanna embarrass
you in front of your gal.

06:23.550 --> 06:24.506
But... I really think
we should wrestle.

06:24.801 --> 06:25.882
ALL: What?

06:26.177 --> 06:29.545
Yeah. I win,
we eat steak.

06:29.848 --> 06:32.306
You win, you shut up
for the rest of your life.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.308
Huh? What do you say,
baby corn?

06:34.603 --> 06:36.264
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's get this off.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.053
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. You're
gonna wanna move comfortably.

06:38.356 --> 06:39.642
Let's get undressed. Let's
get this off. Whoa. Okay.

Let's get naked.
Uh, okay.

06:41.318 --> 06:42.649
No.
This is getting weird.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.059
It's gettin' really weird.
Yeah, let's get weird.

06:44.362 --> 06:46.273
Um, I'm gonna go. Sorry,
Penny. Sorry, Penny. No, Shaun.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.063
Let's get weird. No,
I gotta go. | gotta go.

06:48.366 --> 06:49.276
Shaun... Let's not
get weird. Shaun!

06:49.576 --> 06:50.907
You were gonna tell us
about lentils!

06:51.202 --> 06:52.442
Must be his time
of the month, huh?

06:52.746 --> 06:53.611
What the hell
is wrong with you?

06:55.248 --> 06:56.830

I'm going to my room.

06:58.627 --> 06:59.662

06:59.961 --> 07:00.951
Oh, you're up.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.790

How did you get in here?

07:03.089 --> 07:04.625
| slept here.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.711
Okay, we need to work on my
training for Mr. Super Gay Chicago.

07:07.010 --> 07:07.966
| went to orientation
last night,

07:08.261 --> 07:10.093
and the competition
is stiff.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.970
They disqualified that guy,

07:12.265 --> 07:13.130
but the rest of the
competition is pretty good.

07:14.184 --> 07:16.266
Okay, let's get started.

07:16.561 --> 07:19.144
I'm gonna teach you my winning
routine from Junior Mister '94.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.429
It was the

Uh, Dave, welcome to
the 31st century. Okay?

07:36.456 --> 07:39.915
Ma, to win, you need
flash, flash, flash, and fire.

07:40.210 --> 07:42.998
No. Trust me, as a member
of the small fraternity

07:43.296 --> 07:45.003

pageant veterans,

Q&A and talent.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.387

and gay fitness.

07:54.683 --> 07:57.266
Fine, as long as
Alex doesn't mess this up.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.516

confused with your hairstylist.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.223
Count it. (LAUGHS)

08:11.074 --> 08:11.859
for your date
getting ruined last night.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.195
| feel terrible...

08:14.494 --> 08:16.656
That Brad invited
the Car Czar.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.036
Well, thank you for the
apology. | appreciate it.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.287
But I gotta get ready
for work

08:19.582 --> 08:21.368
so I'll see you guys later,
okay? Bye!

08:21.668 --> 08:22.658
CAR CZAR: Babe, I
got the caramel open.

08:22.961 --> 08:24.543
Get your buns in here.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.545
JANE AND BRAD:
Oh... My... Goodness.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.256
Penny
made a boo-boo.

08:29.551 --> 08:31.133
(WHISPERS) Look, Jane,
you gotta get me out of this!

08:31.428 --> 08:33.419
Hey! Close the door!
What, do you live in a barn?

08:38.559 --> 08:41.177
So that's why you and Penny
seeing each other is a...

08:41.479 --> 08:42.514
(STIFLES LAUGH)
Bad idea.

08:42.813 --> 08:44.020
(EXHALES DEEPLY)
Yeah.

08:44.315 --> 08:45.931
Yeah, I mean...

08:46.234 --> 08:47.190
Thank you
for the heads-up, Jane.

08:47.485 --> 08:48.225
| had...

08:49.404 --> 08:52.396
No idea
she was a democrat.

08:52.699 --> 08:55.157
(EXHALES) Well, | am gonna
steer clear of that pro-union whore.

08:55.452 --> 08:55.987
(CHUCKLES)
(CHUCKLES) Thank you.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.736
So you're out of it.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.452
Oh, thank God! Thank you,
Jane. You have saved my life.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.287
CAR CZAR: Babe, what
do you think of my tushie

09:04.586 --> 09:07.578
on a scale from one to
mouthwatering? (MOUTHS WORDS)

09:07.881 --> 09:10.464
What is wrong with you?
First of all, he is my boss.

09:10.759 --> 09:13.091
Second of all, he is the
grossest man | have ever met.

09:13.386 --> 09:14.922
He has a standing order

09:15.221 --> 09:17.963
at the strip club behind
the dealership, eggs.

09:18.266 --> 09:19.722
| know, but I've never been
with a guy like him before.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.884
He's brash
and old-school,

09:22.187 --> 09:23.723
like Don Draper with twice
the drinking and half the hair.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.683
Plus the sex is amazing.

09:25.982 --> 09:27.598
Okay, please don't judge me!
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Bye!

09:27.901 --> 09:29.312
We are not done
talking about this!

09:29.611 --> 09:30.692
CAR CZAR: All aboard.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.978
(GROANS) Mistake, mistake.
Mistake. Mistake.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.021
Mistake. (GAGS)

09:34.824 --> 09:36.406
Okay, Max,

09:36.701 --> 09:39.534
the Mr. Super Gay Chicago
Q&A section is crucial.

09:39.829 --> 09:42.116
First question,
frittata or quiche?

09:42.415 --> 09:43.621
Well... (IMITATES
BUZZER) Wrong answer.

09:43.917 --> 09:44.873
| didn't even answer.

09:45.168 --> 09:46.704
Don't be so literal, Max.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.869
Does Dave Matthews sing
Ants Marching

09:49.172 --> 09:50.583
because he wants to see
ants marching?

09:50.882 --> 09:51.872
| don't know.
The man's a genius.

09:52.175 --> 09:53.540
It's none of our business.

09:53.843 --> 09:54.708
The point is,
it's about style.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.344
Now you see this?

09:57.639 --> 09:59.971
These are called
ponder hands.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.553
They make me look like
I'm pondering the answer.

10:02.852 --> 10:05.685
Now you try. Where do you put
your hands when you ponder?

10:07.398 --> 10:08.684
No, damn it!
(POUNDS TABLETOP)

10:08.983 --> 10:09.973
(EXHALES)

10:10.276 --> 10:12.017
What's this?

10:12.320 --> 10:14.436
Is this what Alex has
you wearing in clubwear?

10:14.739 --> 10:16.525
Oh, my God.
That is absolutely...

10:16.825 --> 10:18.862
Terrible? That's what he
said about my clubwear?

10:19.160 --> 10:20.150
I'm sorry, Max,
but you look amazing.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.160
Are you sure, Alex?

10:22.455 --> 10:22.990
'Cause there's a breeze,
like...

10:23.790 --> 10:25.155
Everywhere.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.825
It's better to be
memorable than boring.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.460
Do you want to be Russell
Brand or Russell Bland?

10:30.755 --> 10:32.917
(SIGHS) Are those
my only two options?

10:33.216 --> 10:35.332
You have to act like you're
bigger than this whole competition.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.171
Forget ponder hands.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.131
You need to practice
your eye rolls.

10:39.430 --> 10:40.591
Come on. Throw
some shade for papa.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.640
Not big enough.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.768
| wanna see
only whites.

10:47.063 --> 10:47.928
Dark pupils
right to the back.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.898
| realize that
that sounds bad.

10:52.193 --> 10:54.025
Okay, what do you do when
you wanna look annoyed?

10:57.949 --> 10:59.235
Damn it! No, Max.

11:00.827 --> 11:01.692
JANE: What is going on
with you, Penny?

11:01.995 --> 11:03.577
You are a mess.

11:03.872 --> 11:06.489
You look like Coolio after
he takes his braids out. Mmm.

11:06.791 --> 11:09.374
| can't stop having sex
with that Polish caveman.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.410
| don't even like him.
| mean, he disgusts me.

11:11.713 --> 11:13.750
But he has this
magical hold on me.

11:14.048 --> 11:16.210
And sometimes
a real hold.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.250
You ever gotten caught up
in a north-south keylock?

11:18.553 --> 11:20.339
Standing up or sitting
down? (WHISPERS) Both.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.470
Okay, Brad, stay on
message. (WHISPERS) Right.

11:22.765 --> 11:25.132
Penny, I say this with
all the love in my heart...

11:26.853 --> 11:27.809
You're disgusting to me.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.890
Jane, I know.

11:30.190 --> 11:30.975
Okay, but look, | think I've
gotten it out of my system.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.184
Okay.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.724
Okay.
Ooh.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.894
Oh, my God. | did not
invite him here, I swear!

11:37.197 --> 11:39.655
(WHISPERS) Crap.
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Uh...

11:39.949 --> 11:41.235
He has a magical hold
over me, too.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.150
| don't want him anywhere, but
I have to invite him everywhere.

11:43.453 --> 11:46.286
Hey! C-A-R to the czar,
"bout to brunch it up like...

11:46.581 --> 11:48.663
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
A rock star!

11:48.958 --> 11:50.574
(LAUGHS) Yeah.
Okay, you're in a band.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.208
(WHISPERS)
| didn't want to do that.

11:52.503 --> 11:55.120
Hey, Janie, I need you to do
those quarterly reports for me today.

11:55.423 --> 11:56.754
| didn't get to 'em
last night 'cause I was

11:57.050 --> 12:00.509
quote, unquote, busy making
sex with the person to my left.

12:00.803 --> 12:01.918
(WHINES)

12:02.222 --> 12:03.929
(PENNY MOANS)

12:04.224 --> 12:05.134
(MOUTH FULL) Please
continue not to judge me.

12:05.433 --> 12:06.389
BRAD AND JANE: Ugh.
Mmm.

12:06.684 --> 12:07.515
(PENNY MOANS)

12:09.562 --> 12:11.303
(BOTH GAG)

12:11.606 --> 12:12.641
| think that whipped
cream has turned.

12:12.941 --> 12:14.477
(BOTH GAG)

12:14.776 --> 12:16.187
(AMPLIFIED VOICE)
Hello, everyone!

12:16.486 --> 12:17.601
(CHEERING)
Welcome to the first night

12:17.904 --> 12:20.145
of Chicagoland's
second gayest pageant.

12:20.448 --> 12:21.904
I'm your host
Josh Jill.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.656
This is so cool!

12:23.952 --> 12:26.193
| know. | haven't been this
excited since I found out

12:26.496 --> 12:28.703
Donnie Wahlberg and |
share the same birthday.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.033
Well, one day apart.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.870
Our first category is
gay fitness,

12:33.169 --> 12:35.661
which is just like fitness,
only gayer.

12:35.964 --> 12:37.204
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)
(CHEERING)

12:39.300 --> 12:40.790
(CHEERING LOUDLY)

12:48.476 --> 12:50.183
That was gay-rific.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.936
Speaking of fat,
here's Max Blum.

12:53.231 --> 12:54.312
(CHEERING)

12:54.607 --> 12:56.018
(RAGTIME MUSIC PLAYING)

13:00.196 --> 13:01.277
Wait.
What the hell is that?

13:01.572 --> 13:02.277
That's not
what I told him.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.189
No, it's not.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.904
Now he's a classy,
dignified, gentleman of fitness.

13:07.203 --> 13:09.069
This was supposed to be
my category.

13:09.372 --> 13:10.407
Psst, Max!

13:10.707 --> 13:11.742
Max, thrust!

13:12.041 --> 13:13.406
Thrust!
Add a thrust!

13:16.045 --> 13:17.376
DAVE: Don't listen
to her Max.

13:17.672 --> 13:19.413
March and expand!

13:19.716 --> 13:21.252
March and expand!

13:21.551 --> 13:23.883
And smile! Smile!
Thrust! Thrust!

13:24.178 --> 13:25.293
Get those knees up!

13:25.596 --> 13:27.553
Knees up. There it is.
There it is.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.010
(SONG ENDS)

13:30.310 --> 13:31.766
(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)

13:32.061 --> 13:35.474
Okay, that's literally the
worst thing I've ever seen,

13:35.773 --> 13:37.730
and I follow Madeleine
Albright on Instagram.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.647
PENNY:
Ooh, that's the stuff.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.027
CAR CZAR: All right,
all right. There ya are.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.314
(GROANS LOUDLY) So...
Ohh! Yes!

13:45.616 --> 13:46.981
Hmm? There's an exhibit
on mid-century spoons

13:47.285 --> 13:48.696
at the craft museum.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.076
Wow. I love... CAR CZAR
AND PENNY: Chugga-chugga!

13:50.371 --> 13:51.987
Chugga-chugga! Chugga-chugga!
Chugga-chugga! A good spoon.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.121
Chugga-chugga! Choo-choo!
Yeah. Could be interesting.

13:53.416 --> 13:53.871
Yeah.
Could be good.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.282
Mmm.

13:55.585 --> 13:56.495
CAR CZAR:
All aboard!

13:56.794 --> 13:58.580
PENNY:
Here's my ticket, sir!

13:58.880 --> 14:01.668
That's not the ticket
for this train.

14:01.966 --> 14:03.081
Oh, no!
What's gonna happen?

14:03.384 --> 14:04.920
Oh, says here...
Yeah, babe?

14:05.219 --> 14:07.210
They have a spoon that Elvis
used to measure out nougat.

14:07.513 --> 14:08.503
Huh? Yeah. CAR CZAR AND
PENNY: Choo-choo-choo-choo!

14:08.806 --> 14:10.422
Choo-choo-choo-choo!
Choo-choo-choo-choo!

14:10.725 --> 14:11.681
I'm out!
PENNY: & Choo! &

14:11.976 --> 14:13.341
Yep. They broke me...
And probably the guest bed.

14:15.104 --> 14:16.515
Ah. God.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.725
This pageant is
a gay disaster.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.016
It's worse than the time | saw
Bette Midler get on a horse.

14:21.319 --> 14:23.151
| mean,
that Q&A was rough.

14:23.446 --> 14:24.732
Okay, I don't know what's
going on with you, creepy,

14:25.031 --> 14:26.521
but I need
an answer.

14:26.824 --> 14:30.362
The question is,
mousse or parfait?

14:30.661 --> 14:31.901
Hmm. DAVE: Good
ponder hands, Max!

14:32.205 --> 14:33.491
ALEX:
Roll you eyes, more.

14:33.790 --> 14:34.871
I've... I've over...
I've overrolled.

14:35.166 --> 14:36.201
Overrolled. Going down. No.

14:36.501 --> 14:37.536
(THUD)
Gay down!

14:37.835 --> 14:39.542
(WOMAN SCREAMS)
Super gay down!

14:39.837 --> 14:42.169
Max, what we need to do now
is double down on the class.

14:42.465 --> 14:43.921
No way!

14:44.217 --> 14:45.878
Max, you need flash.

14:46.177 --> 14:48.464
Okay, I am talking glitter,
satin, butt crack.

14:48.763 --> 14:50.595
Ugh. What? Are you crazy?

14:50.890 --> 14:52.847
Butt crack has no place
in a gay beauty pageant.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.678
What? Okay, both of you shut it.

14:54.977 --> 14:56.388
The only reason
| did this thing

14:56.687 --> 14:58.269
is because I'm sick of being
the poor one all the time.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.350
It's embarrassing.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.391
And I asked
you two for help,

15:02.693 --> 15:03.854
and you turned it around
and made it all about you.

15:05.530 --> 15:06.861
Now if you'll excuse me,
you're both fired.

15:08.574 --> 15:09.814
Later, honey boobs-boobs.

15:10.118 --> 15:10.983
(GIGGLING)
(CHUCKLES)

15:13.996 --> 15:15.578
(CHUCKLES)

15:15.873 --> 15:17.534
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Aah! Hey!

15:18.334 --> 15:20.371
Hey, it's you!

15:20.670 --> 15:21.660
You know, I've been
meaning to compliment you.

15:21.963 --> 15:23.499
Your coming out of nowhere
has just gotten amazing.

15:23.798 --> 15:25.709
Well, tired.
(SNAPS FINGERS)

15:26.008 --> 15:28.875
Not so fast, young lady. We
need to talk about the Car Czar.

15:29.178 --> 15:30.213
Brad and I feel he's a
bad influence on you

15:30.513 --> 15:31.799
and maybe it's time
to slow it down.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.884
We're not mad!
We're just disappointed!

15:34.183 --> 15:35.765
Okay. (CHUCKLES)
What's going on?

15:36.060 --> 15:37.642
Brad and I have
discussed it,

15:37.937 --> 15:39.644
and we forbid you from
seeing the Car Czar ever again.

15:39.939 --> 15:43.273
Uh, you forbid me? Hellur.
You're not the boss of me.

15:43.568 --> 15:45.479
Pradesh Singh, the head of
global PR, is the boss of me.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.314
Although she may be
going on maternity leave,

15:47.613 --> 15:49.069
so it's probably gonna be
Nancy Goldberg.

15:49.365 --> 15:50.901
Please. Maternity leave
is for hippies. (SCOFFS)

15:51.200 --> 15:51.689
If you're gonna
live under our roof,

15:51.993 --> 15:53.483
you're gonna follow
our rules.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.652
Well, that's good "cause I don't
need to live under your roof anymore,

15:55.955 --> 15:57.366
<i>because as of tonight, my
apartment's ready. Good.</i>

15:57.665 --> 15:59.406
Great.
Think about your future!

15:59.709 --> 16:00.949
Honey, we don't need
to yell. I'm not yelling!

16:02.420 --> 16:03.455
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Actually, I was yelling.

16:03.754 --> 16:04.539
And I regret nothing!

16:04.839 --> 16:05.795
This is so unfair!

16:06.090 --> 16:07.171
Penelope Hartz,

16:07.467 --> 16:09.128
when I said for you
to have a fling,

16:09.427 --> 16:12.294
| meant with a nice,
normal boy like Shaun...

16:12.597 --> 16:13.758
Normal boy!

16:14.056 --> 16:15.672
Not my...
Pig of a boss.

16:15.975 --> 16:16.931
Well,
maybe it's not a fling.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.263
Maybe it's love.

16:19.562 --> 16:20.893
You ever think of that,
Jane? Maybe I love him.

16:22.231 --> 16:23.096
(GASPS)

16:24.609 --> 16:25.314
(WHISPERS) Yeah.

16:30.031 --> 16:32.398
| came back to get my keys,
and you unlocked my heart.

16:32.700 --> 16:33.735
Oh! (CHUCKLES)

16:44.420 --> 16:45.956
Mmm. Mmm.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.246
Congratulations,
lovebirds.

16:48.549 --> 16:49.539
This is a nightmare!

16:54.472 --> 16:56.338
Ahh.
(OBJECTS CLATTER)

16:56.641 --> 16:57.346
Thanks, again,
kitty cat,

16:57.642 --> 16:59.428
for letting me
crash here a while.

16:59.727 --> 17:00.558

for my chin-up bar.

| got the same one
as Paul Ryan.

17:04.898 --> 17:06.435
We have the same bod. We
could totally share clothes.

to you right now.

if, uh, you play your cards right,

17:14.700 --> 17:17.237
you keep those chest
pumpkins up and runnin',

17:17.537 --> 17:19.198

become a permanent thing.

17:19.497 --> 17:21.079
How great would that be,
huh?

17:21.374 --> 17:22.739
HUH?
(LAUGHS)

17:23.041 --> 17:23.998
Suh great.

17:25.795 --> 17:27.705
Hey! How did you guys
get in here?

17:28.005 --> 17:29.461
Your front door's
missing.

17:29.757 --> 17:31.043
Duh. I needed
a headboard.

17:32.677 --> 17:33.712
Clearly.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.044
Why you guys here?

17:36.347 --> 17:38.179
Because we're sorry and
we really wanna help you.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.556
(SCOFFS) It's too late. I'm in
last place in the competition.

17:40.851 --> 17:42.216
The only event
| won was

17:42.520 --> 17:44.431
how many marshmallows
could you fit in your mouth, 41.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.471
It is not too late. Tonight
is the talent competition.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.014
That's half your score.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.684
If you win that, you could
win the whole damn thing.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.149
Yep. That's why we came
up with a kick-ass routine

17:53.447 --> 17:55.484
that combines old school
class with new school flash.

17:55.783 --> 17:56.864
And fire!

17:57.159 --> 17:58.820
Whoa!
Fire's awesome! I'm in.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.235

normally like that?

Uh-huh.

sugar face. Bad news.

18:17.638 --> 18:20.096
That sweet bag o'
garbage is taking me back.

18:20.391 --> 18:21.301

devastated.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.523

know, here's your stuff! Oh.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.729
Okay.

Give you those
babies back. Okay.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.192
Al right.

18:37.491 --> 18:38.071
Well, this
has been fun.

18:40.161 --> 18:41.401
I've never been with a
woman who's owned books.

18:42.371 --> 18:43.486
They're for reading.

18:43.789 --> 18:44.403

18:46.292 --> 18:47.498
No.

19:00.014 --> 19:01.550
Oh, you screamed right in
my ear and my, my whole face!

19:01.849 --> 19:02.930
We should not have copies
of each other's keys.

19:04.435 --> 19:05.300

Oh, my God.

19:06.103 --> 19:07.468

19:07.772 --> 19:08.933
Look, it wasn't right of
me to tell you what to do.

19:09.857 --> 19:10.767
This is your life.

19:11.067 --> 19:12.228

your advice was great.

And I'm glad that the
Car Czar was such a pig,

because I didn't get
emotionally invested.

19:48.813 --> 19:50.019

his name.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.475

with a Lon?

19:54.443 --> 19:55.353
