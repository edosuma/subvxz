WEBVTT

00:00.966 --> 00:02.366
YOU'RE GOING TO WALK
INTO THAT COURTROOM

00:02.433 --> 00:04.066
BY HIS SIDE,
HOLDING HIS HAND.

00:04.133 --> 00:05.233
NEVER GIVE THE JURY
A CHANCE

00:05.300 --> 00:06.766
TO THINK THAT
YOU'RE NOT DEVOTED.

00:06.833 --> 00:08.933
OR THE MEDIA. THE FACT
THAT THE JURY'S SEQUESTERED
DOESN'T MATTER.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.133
NEWSPAPERS GET THROUGH.
TELEVISION, TOO.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.300
THEY'LL SAY HE CAME
TO KILL HER THAT NIGHT.

00:13.366 --> 00:15.800
WE'LL SAY HE CAME
TO <i>SEE</i> HER THE DAY OF.

00:15.866 --> 00:18.366
THEY'LL SAY
HE GOT SCRATCHED
WHILE ATTACKING HER.

00:18.433 --> 00:20.033
WE'LL SAY
SHE SCRATCHED HIM

00:20.100 --> 00:21.100
WHILE MAKING LOVE.

00:21.166 --> 00:22.966
THEY'LL SAY,
WHERE'S THE SEMEN?

00:23.033 --> 00:25.166
WE'LL SAY
A--SHE TOOK A BATH,

00:25.233 --> 00:27.166
B--HE WORE A CONDOM.

00:27.233 --> 00:29.600
EVERY RED HERRING
HAS TO BE COVERED.

00:29.666 --> 00:31.833
THEY'LL BE RUNNING
THEM UP FLAGPOLES,
I GUARANTEE IT.

00:31.900 --> 00:33.433
WHAT ABOUT
THE SHOE?

00:34.233 --> 00:36.166
WE'LL SEE AS WE GO.

00:36.233 --> 00:40.100
HAIR, PRINTS, FIBERS--
NOTHING WE CAN'T EXPLAIN.

00:40.166 --> 00:41.666
WE GOTTA TAKE OUT
THE MOTHER.

00:41.733 --> 00:43.200
IF THOSE THREATS
COME IN...

00:43.266 --> 00:44.500
ARE YOU SET ON THAT?

00:44.566 --> 00:46.400
YES, BUT DON'T FIGURE
TO SUPPRESS.

00:46.466 --> 00:47.533
AND IF WE
DON'T SUPPRESS,

00:47.600 --> 00:49.833
FIGURE THE MOTHER
TO TESTIFY FIRST.

00:49.900 --> 00:51.233
THEY MIGHT LEAD
WITH DNA.

00:51.300 --> 00:53.133
I'M NOT LEADING OFF
WITH THE DNA.

00:53.200 --> 00:54.433
IT'LL PUT THE JURY TO SLEEP.

00:54.500 --> 00:55.566
WE GO WITH
THE VICTIM'S MOTHER.

00:55.633 --> 00:57.566
SHE'S READY.
I'VE BEEN OVER
HER TESTIMONY--

00:57.633 --> 00:59.200
GO OVER IT WITH HER AGAIN.

00:59.266 --> 01:00.666
HOW CAN I NOT TESTIFY?

01:00.733 --> 01:01.566
I'M NOT SAYING YOU WON'T,

01:01.633 --> 01:03.233
BUT THE DECISION DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE MADE YET.

01:03.300 --> 01:04.700
IF THEY DON'T MAKE
THEIR CASE,

01:04.766 --> 01:06.866
WE DON'T GIVE THEM THE CHANCE
TO TAKE WHACKS AT YOU.

01:06.933 --> 01:09.600
YOU SET?

01:09.666 --> 01:10.600
I'M SET.

01:11.866 --> 01:13.000
BOBBY...

01:14.533 --> 01:16.833
ALMOST 3 MONTHS...

01:16.900 --> 01:18.433
YOU'VE NEVER ASKED ME
IF I'M INNOCENT.

01:19.966 --> 01:21.100
I AM.

01:22.033 --> 01:23.466
I AM.

01:24.533 --> 01:27.366
EXPEDITED TRANSCRIPTS
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

01:27.433 --> 01:30.533
ALL RIGHT. WE'RE READY.
YOU READY?

01:30.600 --> 01:32.000
OK...

01:32.066 --> 01:33.833
THAT DOCTOR CUT OFF
CINDY MARKS' HEAD.

01:33.900 --> 01:35.466
NOW WE GO AFTER HIS.

02:25.333 --> 02:27.233
YOU'RE THE SAME REPORTER
WHO'S BEEN CALLING.

02:27.300 --> 02:29.666
YOU DON'T THINK
I KNOW YOUR VOICE?

02:29.733 --> 02:31.533
DO YOU RECOGNIZE
MY CLICK?

02:31.600 --> 02:35.133
SOME OF THE EXPECTED JUICE
HAS DRIPPED AWAY, JANET.

02:35.200 --> 02:38.066
IT SEEMS D.A. GAMBLE
AND DEFENSE ATTORNEY DONNELL

02:38.133 --> 02:39.666
ARE NO LONGER
ROMANTIC PARTNERS.

02:39.733 --> 02:42.166
SOURCES SAY OTHER THAN
TRIAL CORRESPONDENCE,

02:42.233 --> 02:45.500
COMMUNICATION HAS BEEN
SPARSE BETWEEN THEM.

02:45.566 --> 02:48.066
FIGURE THE DIALOGUE
TO HEAT UP THIS MORNING,
THOUGH.

02:48.133 --> 02:49.533
THE SUBJECT OF THE PRETRIAL:

02:49.600 --> 02:52.433
WHETHER OR NOT
LORRAINE MARKS
GETS TO TESTIFY

02:52.500 --> 02:55.300
ABOUT THE THREATS
DR. WINSLOW MADE
TO HER DAUGHTER.

02:55.366 --> 02:57.633
IT ISN'T
JUST HEARSAY.
IT'S TOTEM POLE.

02:57.700 --> 02:59.800
IT WOULD BE
REVERSIBLE ERROR
TO ALLOW IT.

02:59.866 --> 03:03.466
YOUR HONOR, THESE STATEMENTS
WOULD CLEARLY BE EXEMPTED
FROM THE HEARSAY RULE.

03:03.533 --> 03:04.366
CLEAR TO WHO?

03:04.433 --> 03:06.300
CINDY MARKS WAS
IN AN EXCITED STATE

03:06.366 --> 03:07.533
WHEN SHE SAID
THESE THINGS.

03:07.600 --> 03:08.433
WE'RE NOT JUST DEALING

03:08.500 --> 03:10.300
WITH CINDY MARKS' STATEMENTS
TO HER MOTHER.

03:10.366 --> 03:12.466
WE'RE DEALING
WITH SUPPOSED STATEMENTS
MADE BY MY CLIENT

03:12.533 --> 03:14.833
TO CINDY MARKS.
I DON'T CARE
HOW EXCITED SHE WAS

03:14.900 --> 03:16.533
WHEN SHE WAS TALKING
TO HER MOTHER.

03:16.600 --> 03:19.900
SHE WAS PASSING THINGS ON
THAT HE SAID TO HER.
THAT'S HEARSAY, TOO.

03:19.966 --> 03:22.600
HIS STATEMENTS
WOULD BE DECLARATIONS
AGAINST INTEREST.

03:22.666 --> 03:24.733
COME ON, HELEN. I KNOW
YOU WENT TO LAW SCHOOL.
I WAS THERE.

03:24.800 --> 03:25.866
I OBJECT TO THAT.

03:25.933 --> 03:28.200
ALL RIGHT.
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

03:28.266 --> 03:30.900
THE TESTIMONY
OF MRS. MARKS
IS ADMISSIBLE.

03:30.966 --> 03:33.633
OPENING STATEMENTS
AFTER LUNCH.

03:33.700 --> 03:35.400
ADJOURNED.

03:35.466 --> 03:38.433
[POUNDS GAVEL]

03:38.500 --> 03:41.333
AN EXTREMELY BIG WIN
FOR THE PROSECUTION, JIM.

03:41.400 --> 03:44.566
ABSOLUTELY.
THE VICTIM'S MOTHER
ESTABLISHES MOTIVE.

03:44.633 --> 03:46.833
THE PROSECUTION CAN
EASILY PROVE THE AFFAIR.

03:46.900 --> 03:48.200
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

03:48.266 --> 03:50.500
BUT MOTIVE TO KILL,
THE THREATS TO KILL,

03:50.566 --> 03:52.400
THAT ALL COMES
FROM LORRAINE MARKS,

03:52.466 --> 03:55.000
AND SHE CAN BE VERY TOUGH
FOR THE DEFENSE TO CRACK.

03:55.066 --> 03:57.866
I APOLOGIZE...

03:57.933 --> 04:00.233
NOT JUST BECAUSE
WE'RE ASKING YOU

04:00.300 --> 04:02.633
TO TAKE TIME OUT
FROM YOUR FAMILIES

04:02.700 --> 04:04.100
AND YOUR LIVES,

04:04.166 --> 04:06.000
BUT BECAUSE WE'RE
ASKING YOU TO FOCUS

04:06.066 --> 04:09.266
ON THE VERY WORST
HUMAN NATURE HAS TO OFFER:

04:09.333 --> 04:11.133
MURDER.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.633
THIS WAS A GRUESOME,
SICKENING CRIME.

04:13.700 --> 04:15.866
HE CUT OFF HER HEAD,

04:15.933 --> 04:18.000
HE CHOPPED OFF HER HANDS.

04:18.065 --> 04:20.966
AND AS WE GO THROUGH
THE FACTS OF THIS CASE,

04:21.033 --> 04:22.766
IT WILL BE DIFFICULT,

04:22.833 --> 04:24.500
IT WILL BE PAINFUL.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.866
PAINFUL TO FACE A REALITY

04:28.933 --> 04:32.800
THAT SOMETIMES
UNDERNEATH COATS AND TIES

04:32.866 --> 04:35.066
AND WELL-GROOMED
APPEARANCES...

04:36.600 --> 04:39.066
THERE LIE MURDERERS.

04:39.133 --> 04:40.733
THERE LIES ONE HERE.

04:43.233 --> 04:46.000
YES, THERE WAS SEX

04:46.066 --> 04:48.566
AND LOVE AND PASSION.

04:48.633 --> 04:52.366
JEFFREY WINSLOW
WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH THE VICTIM.

04:52.433 --> 04:55.200
LISTEN TO THE PROSECUTION'S
CASE CLOSELY.

04:55.266 --> 04:56.900
ALL IT WILL PROVE

04:56.966 --> 04:59.033
IS WHAT I JUST TOLD YOU,

04:59.100 --> 05:02.766
MY CLIENT HAD AN AFFAIR
WITH CINDY MARKS.

05:02.833 --> 05:04.033
THAT'S ALL THEY'VE GOT

05:04.100 --> 05:08.466
BECAUSE THAT'S ALL THERE IS.

05:08.533 --> 05:11.333
YES, SOMEBODY
DID KILL HER...

05:13.533 --> 05:15.466
BUT IT WASN'T
JEFFREY WINSLOW.

05:21.633 --> 05:25.066
SO THIS TELEPHONE CONVERSATION
TOOK PLACE WHEN, MA'AM?

05:25.133 --> 05:26.800
3 DAYS BEFORE
SHE WAS KILLED.

05:26.866 --> 05:28.200
SHE CALLED YOU?

05:28.266 --> 05:30.966
NO. I'D CALLED HER,

05:31.033 --> 05:33.066
AND I SAW THAT SHE
WAS VERY UPSET.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.233
DID SHE TELL YOU
WHY SHE WAS UPSET?

05:35.300 --> 05:36.733
SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO DISCUSS IT.

05:36.800 --> 05:38.933
CINDY AND I
NEVER REALLY
COMMUNICATED MUCH

05:39.000 --> 05:40.100
ON HER PRIVATE LIFE,

05:40.166 --> 05:42.833
SINCE I USUALLY
DISAPPROVED OF IT.

05:42.900 --> 05:46.033
SO SHE NEVER TOLD YOU
THE CAUSE OF HER BEING UPSET?

05:46.100 --> 05:48.700
EVENTUALLY, SHE DID.

05:48.766 --> 05:50.900
WHEN I PRESSED HER
ON IT...

05:50.966 --> 05:52.266
SHE TOLD ME.

05:52.333 --> 05:54.133
SHE SAID
HER RELATIONSHIP
WITH DR. WINSLOW

05:54.200 --> 05:57.200
WAS BECOMING UGLY...
VOLATILE.

05:57.266 --> 05:59.933
SHE SAID SHE WANTED
TO MAKE PUBLIC
THEIR INVOLVEMENT,

06:00.000 --> 06:02.266
AND HE THREATENED HER.

06:02.333 --> 06:04.900
HE SAID IF SHE TRIED
TO EXPOSE THE AFFAIR,

06:04.966 --> 06:06.433
THAT HE WOULD STOP HER.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.766
DID SHE SAY ANYTHING ELSE,
MRS. MARKS?

06:08.833 --> 06:11.100
YES. SHE SAID...

06:11.166 --> 06:13.666
SHE WAS SCARED
THAT HE MIGHT HURT HER.

06:13.733 --> 06:15.466
THANK YOU,
MRS. MARKS.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.866
YOU SAID
SHE NEVER LIKED

06:18.933 --> 06:20.800
TO DISCUSS
HER PRIVATE LIFE
WITH YOU.

06:20.866 --> 06:21.833
YES.

06:21.900 --> 06:23.433
MIGHT SHE GO SO FAR

06:23.500 --> 06:25.866
AS TO CONCEAL HER
PERSONAL LIFE FROM YOU?

06:25.933 --> 06:27.466
SHE MIGHT.

06:27.533 --> 06:30.700
GIVEN THAT YOUR DAUGHTER
MIGHT CONCEAL
HER PERSONAL LIFE FROM YOU,

06:30.766 --> 06:33.300
IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT SHE WAS ALSO
SEEING SOMEBODY ELSE

06:33.366 --> 06:34.833
IN ADDITION TO MY CLIENT

06:34.900 --> 06:37.333
AND SHE WOULD TRY
TO CONCEAL THAT?

06:37.400 --> 06:39.100
I SUPPOSE
IT'S POSSIBLE.

06:41.966 --> 06:44.033
Eugene: YOU SEE
THAT MAN SITTING THERE?

06:44.100 --> 06:45.200
WHO IS HE?

06:45.266 --> 06:48.333
HIS NAME
IS KENNETH FULLER.

06:48.400 --> 06:49.633
HE'S CINDY'S
EX-HUSBAND.

06:49.700 --> 06:51.633
COULD YOU DESCRIBE
YOUR FEELINGS FOR HIM?

06:51.700 --> 06:52.733
NOT GOOD.

06:52.800 --> 06:55.200
NOT GOOD. UH...

06:55.266 --> 06:57.200
WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY
THAT YOU DISLIKE HIM A LOT?

06:57.266 --> 06:58.633
THAT WOULD BE FAIR.

06:58.700 --> 06:59.766
YOUR DAUGHTER KNEW THAT?

06:59.833 --> 07:01.000
IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS.

07:01.066 --> 07:03.400
SUPPOSE, MRS. MARKS,
JUST SUPPOSE...

07:03.466 --> 07:06.500
YOUR DAUGHTER RESUMED
A RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS MAN.

07:06.566 --> 07:07.766
YOU'D DISAPPROVE?

07:07.833 --> 07:08.866
STRONGLY.

07:08.933 --> 07:10.733
STRONGLY.

07:10.800 --> 07:14.133
KNOWING THAT, IS IT POSSIBLE
CINDY WOULD WANT TO HIDE
THAT FACT FROM YOU?

07:14.200 --> 07:15.500
YOUR HONOR.
Mrs. Marks:
I DON'T THINK SHE--

07:15.566 --> 07:17.866
IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT KENNETH FULLER

07:17.933 --> 07:20.133
WAS THE ONE THAT
WAS THREATENING HER?

07:20.200 --> 07:22.000
SHE SAID IT WAS HIM.
AND THAT IN HER HYSTERIA,

07:22.066 --> 07:24.500
SHE JUST BLURTED OUT
MY CLIENT'S NAME?
SHE WASN'T
HYSTERICAL.

07:24.566 --> 07:26.000
OBJECTION!
BUT SHE WAS
OUT OF CONTROL,

07:26.066 --> 07:27.966
RANTING.
NO,
SHE WASN'T RANTING!

07:28.033 --> 07:30.300
SHE WAS CALM
AND COLLECTED,

07:30.366 --> 07:32.100
AND SHE
VERY CLEARLY SAID

07:32.166 --> 07:33.133
THAT IT WAS THAT MAN

07:33.200 --> 07:35.233
WHO WAS
THREATENING HER.

07:35.300 --> 07:37.800
SO SHE WAS CALM
AND COLLECTED?

07:37.866 --> 07:39.033
YES.

07:39.100 --> 07:40.533
YOUR HONOR, AT THIS TIME,

07:40.600 --> 07:42.666
WE'D NOW MOVE TO STRIKE
THE HEARSAY TESTIMONY
OF THE WITNESS.

07:42.733 --> 07:44.866
THE EXCITED UTTERANCE
EXCEPTION NO LONGER APPLIES.

07:44.933 --> 07:46.833
SIDEBAR.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.533
I'M AFRAID NOT.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.833
MEMBERS OF THE JURY,

07:50.900 --> 07:52.666
I'LL TRY TO MAKE
THE LESSON SHORT.

07:52.733 --> 07:56.700
THE FACT THAT
THE VICTIM MADE
THESE ALLEGED STATEMENTS

07:56.766 --> 07:58.800
WHILE CALM
INSTEAD OF AGITATED

07:58.866 --> 08:00.966
MAKES A BIG
LEGAL DIFFERENCE.

08:01.033 --> 08:04.166
BOTTOM LINE--THEY'RE
NO LONGER ADMISSIBLE.

08:04.233 --> 08:08.433
THAT MEANS THERE IS
NO EVIDENCE BEFORE YOU

08:08.500 --> 08:11.233
THAT A RELATIONSHIP
WAS TURNING UGLY,

08:11.300 --> 08:14.600
THERE IS NO EVIDENCE
OF ANY THREATS.

08:14.666 --> 08:17.966
AS FAR AS YOU'RE CONCERNED,

08:18.033 --> 08:21.100
THOSE THREATS
NEVER HAPPENED.

08:22.866 --> 08:24.066
CALM DOWN, HELEN.

08:24.133 --> 08:25.800
YOU TOLD ME
SHE WAS PREPPED.

08:25.866 --> 08:27.233
SHE SAID YOU WENT
UP AND DOWN--

08:27.300 --> 08:28.266
I DID.
HE SPUN HER.

08:28.333 --> 08:29.733
SHE'S NOT
A ROCKET SCIENTIST.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.066
WE'RE THE ONES
WHO LOOK STUPID.

08:31.133 --> 08:32.133
THE JURY STILL HEARD IT.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.700
LEGALLY,
IT MAY BE EXCLUDED,

08:33.765 --> 08:34.666
BUT THE JURY
STILL HEARD--

08:34.732 --> 08:37.533
I CAN'T ARGUE IT
IN MY CLOSING ARGUMENT NOW!

08:37.600 --> 08:40.166
THERE IS A LOT
OF DNA SCIENTIFIC CRAP

08:40.232 --> 08:43.799
BETWEEN NOW AND THE TIME
THAT JURY GOES TO DELIBERATE,

08:43.866 --> 08:45.000
AND I CAN'T
HAMMER THOSE THREATS

08:45.066 --> 08:47.600
IN MY CLOSING ARGUMENT
NOW, CAN IT?

08:49.100 --> 08:51.766
OH GOD.

08:51.833 --> 08:53.233
MISTRIAL?

08:53.300 --> 08:55.233
IT'S AN OPTION.
SINCE THE TRIAL'S
ONLY A DAY OLD,

08:55.300 --> 08:56.966
THERE'S A CHANCE WE
COULD STILL GET IT.

08:57.033 --> 08:58.100
AND WHY WOULD WE WANT
TO DO THAT?

08:58.166 --> 09:00.200
BECAUSE THE JURY DID HEAR
ABOUT THE THREATS,

09:00.266 --> 09:01.533
AND IT'S A TOUGH BELL
TO UNRING.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.266
AND THE NEXT JURY
WOULDN'T HEAR ABOUT THEM.

09:03.333 --> 09:04.833
Karen: OK, THEN WHY NOT
ASK FOR A MISTRIAL?

09:04.900 --> 09:06.900
WHY NOT IS BECAUSE
THE PROSECUTION
CAME OUT STUMBLING.

09:06.966 --> 09:08.300
FIRST IMPRESSIONS COUNT,

09:08.366 --> 09:10.566
AND I THINK THEIR CASE
IS SO CIRCUMSTANTIAL
TO BEGIN WITH.

09:10.633 --> 09:11.866
I SAY WE KEEP GOING.

09:11.933 --> 09:12.866
IF WE LET THEM
START OVER,

09:12.933 --> 09:13.866
WE GIVE THEM TIME
TO REGROUP,

09:13.933 --> 09:15.800
PLUS THEY COULD
DO MORE DISCOVERY.

09:15.866 --> 09:17.066
I'M WITH LINDSAY.

09:17.133 --> 09:19.200
WHO'S NEXT?

09:19.266 --> 09:20.266
Rebecca:
THE PATHOLOGIST.

09:20.333 --> 09:21.100
MINE.

09:21.166 --> 09:22.233
Bobby: YOU READY?

09:22.300 --> 09:24.333
BOBBY, YOU WALK AROUND
ALL DAY ASKING,

09:24.400 --> 09:25.533
"ARE YOU READY?
ARE YOU READY?"

09:25.600 --> 09:26.566
OF COURSE I'M READY.

09:26.633 --> 09:27.833
WE ARE ALL READY.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.733
OK.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.100
NO MISTRIAL.

09:31.166 --> 09:32.333
WE KEEP GOING.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.333
BOBBY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

09:44.166 --> 09:45.466
I DON'T KNOW.

09:48.400 --> 09:50.333
SOMETHING JUST
DOESN'T SMELL RIGHT.

10:15.099 --> 10:16.266
SO YOU MADE A DETERMINATION

10:16.333 --> 10:18.766
THAT THE KILLING WAS
THE WORK OF A COPYCAT?

10:18.833 --> 10:21.666
YES, UPON DOING
THE AUTOPSY.

10:21.733 --> 10:23.366
HOW DID THE AUTOPSY
TELL YOU THIS?

10:23.433 --> 10:26.833
WELL, THE VICTIM
WAS KILLED BY TRAUMA
TO THE HEAD,

10:26.899 --> 10:28.833
THOUGH IT WAS MADE
TO LOOK LIKE
A STABBING,

10:28.899 --> 10:31.199
WHICH WOULD
BE CONSISTENT
WITH THE POET.

10:31.266 --> 10:33.966
ALSO, WE FOUND THAT
MISS MARKS' WOUNDS
WERE MORE CLINICAL.

10:34.033 --> 10:35.699
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
CLINICAL?

10:35.766 --> 10:38.033
LIGAMENTS WERE
INCISED INDIVIDUALLY.

10:38.099 --> 10:40.633
THE PERSON WHO DID IT
CUT THROUGH
THE SOFT TISSUE.

10:40.699 --> 10:41.933
MEANING WHAT?

10:41.999 --> 10:44.199
MEANING THIS LIKELY WAS
THE WORK OF A DOCTOR,

10:44.266 --> 10:45.866
PERHAPS
A SKILLED SURGEON.

10:45.933 --> 10:47.433
[CROWD MUTTERING]

10:48.999 --> 10:50.199
Judge Hiller: SETTLE.

10:51.533 --> 10:54.533
ANYTHING ELSE, DOCTOR?

10:54.599 --> 10:57.799
YES. THOUGH THERE WAS
EVIDENCE OF INTERCOURSE,

10:57.866 --> 10:59.666
THERE WAS NO BRUISING
TO SUGGEST RAPE.

10:59.733 --> 11:02.366
AND WHAT CONCLUSIONS,
IF ANY,
DID YOU DRAW FROM THIS?

11:02.433 --> 11:04.533
THAT THE VICTIM CONSENTED
TO THE INTERCOURSE.

11:04.599 --> 11:07.566
I BELIEVE SHE KNEW
THE PERSON WHO KILLED HER.

11:13.233 --> 11:16.133
DID YOUR WRITTEN REPORT
EVER SAY THIS WAS
THE WORK OF A SURGEON?

11:16.199 --> 11:18.099
NO.

11:18.166 --> 11:20.833
AND YOU CAN'T POSITIVELY
EXCLUDE THE POET, CAN YOU?

11:20.899 --> 11:22.833
NO, BUT THE EVIDENCE
WOULD SUGGEST--

11:22.899 --> 11:24.399
IS THE POET
STILL AT LARGE?

11:24.466 --> 11:25.533
YES.

11:25.599 --> 11:27.899
YOU SAY
THAT CINDY DIED

11:27.966 --> 11:29.333
FROM TRAUMA
TO THE HEAD.

11:29.399 --> 11:32.233
HOW EXACTLY DID YOU
DETERMINE THAT?

11:32.299 --> 11:34.699
FROM THE SKULL FRACTURE
ON THE LEFT
TEMPORAL LOBE.

11:34.766 --> 11:35.799
THE HEAD HAD BEEN CUT OFF?

11:35.866 --> 11:37.066
YES.

11:37.133 --> 11:39.199
ANYBODY EVER DROP IT
ON THE FLOOR?

11:39.266 --> 11:41.633
THAT WASN'T THE FRACTURE
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

11:41.699 --> 11:45.599
DID YOU EVER SEE ANYBODY
DROP CINDY'S HEAD
ON THE FLOOR, DOCTOR?

11:45.666 --> 11:49.499
THE HEAD INADVERTENTLY
ROLLED OFF
THE AUTOPSY TABLE.

11:49.566 --> 11:51.133
HIT THE FLOOR?

11:51.199 --> 11:54.066
THAT'S NOT THE TRAUMA
THAT CAUSED HER DEATH,
COUNSEL.

11:54.133 --> 11:56.333
I SEE.

11:56.399 --> 11:59.266
YOU SAY THE ABSENCE
OF VAGINAL BRUISING

11:59.333 --> 12:01.133
SUGGESTS
CONSENSUAL INTERCOURSE?

12:01.199 --> 12:02.133
YES.

12:02.199 --> 12:04.833
EVER KNOWN A RAPE TO OCCUR
WITH NO VAGINAL BRUISING?

12:04.899 --> 12:06.166
THE PROBABILITIES ARE--

12:06.233 --> 12:07.666
DOES IT EVER HAPPEN,
DOCTOR?

12:07.733 --> 12:09.666
RAPE, NO BRUISES.
CAN THAT HAPPEN?

12:09.733 --> 12:10.633
YES.

12:10.699 --> 12:12.133
SO IT'S
ENTIRELY POSSIBLE

12:12.199 --> 12:14.166
THAT CINDY MARKS
WAS RAPED AND MURDERED

12:14.233 --> 12:15.999
BY A NON-DOCTOR.
THAT'S POSSIBLE,
AM I RIGHT?

12:16.066 --> 12:18.733
POSSIBLE, BUT NOT LIKELY,
IN MY OPINION.

12:18.799 --> 12:20.299
YES, YES, YOUR OPINION.

12:20.366 --> 12:24.233
THIS SUSPICION OF YOURS
THAT A SURGEON
DID THE KILLING,

12:24.299 --> 12:26.566
WHEN EXACTLY DID YOU
COME UP WITH THIS?

12:26.633 --> 12:28.566
AT THE AUTOPSY.

12:28.633 --> 12:29.566
AT THE AUTOPSY.

12:29.633 --> 12:32.366
AND DID YOU SHARE IT
WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY?

12:32.433 --> 12:33.866
YES.
WHEN?

12:33.933 --> 12:35.733
OBJECTION. WORK PRODUCT.

12:35.799 --> 12:37.033
OVERRULED.

12:37.099 --> 12:38.399
WHEN DID YOU TELL
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY

12:38.466 --> 12:40.399
ABOUT YOUR SUSPICION THAT
THE KILLER WAS A SURGEON?

12:40.466 --> 12:43.233
I TOLD HER AROUND THE TIME
OF THE AUTOPSY.

12:43.299 --> 12:44.633
BUT YOU DIDN'T
WRITE IT DOWN?

12:44.699 --> 12:45.966
NO.

12:46.033 --> 12:47.599
DID SHE ASK YOU NOT
TO WRITE IT DOWN?
OBJECTION.

12:47.666 --> 12:48.866
WAS THIS SUSPICION HATCHED

12:48.933 --> 12:50.533
BETWEEN THE BOTH
OF YOU YESTERDAY,
OBJECTION!

12:50.599 --> 12:51.933
OR DID YOU DELIBERATELY
WITHHOLD THIS--
OBJECTION!

12:51.999 --> 12:54.599
COUNSEL, APPROACH.

13:00.633 --> 13:02.533
SHE HAS THE DUTY
TO TURN OVER ALL
INCULPATORY EVIDENCE.

13:02.599 --> 13:03.766
I DID.

13:03.833 --> 13:05.199
TESTIMONY THAT IT WAS
THE WORK OF A SURGEON,

13:05.266 --> 13:06.999
TASTY LITTLE TIDBIT
TO LEAVE OUT, HELEN.

13:07.066 --> 13:09.233
YOU KNEW THIS WITNESS
WAS GOING TO BE SAYING
COPYCAT.

13:09.299 --> 13:10.733
WE DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS GOING TO BE
SAYING SURGEON.

13:10.799 --> 13:11.799
Judge Hiller: ALL RIGHT.

13:11.866 --> 13:12.866
THAT TESTIMONY
SHOULD BE STRICKEN.

13:12.933 --> 13:13.933
I SAID, ALL RIGHT.

13:13.999 --> 13:15.033
IT'S
UNFAIR SURPRISE.

13:15.099 --> 13:16.033
IF WE WOULD
HAVE KNOWN--

13:16.099 --> 13:18.299
COUNSEL,
THIS IS MY COURTROOM.

13:19.833 --> 13:22.066
I DON'T LIKE IT,

13:22.133 --> 13:24.466
BUT I'M NOT
STRIKING IT.

13:24.533 --> 13:25.533
YOUR HONOR--

13:25.599 --> 13:27.433
I'VE MADE MY RULING.
STEP BACK.

13:30.699 --> 13:31.933
YOU DID GREAT.
YOU CHIPPED HIM DOWN.

13:31.999 --> 13:32.899
Reporter: MR. DONNELL.
MISS FRUTT, WHAT--

13:32.966 --> 13:34.566
WOULD YOU GET THE HELL
OUT OF MY FACE?

13:34.633 --> 13:35.799
MISS FRUTT,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

13:35.866 --> 13:38.266
HEY, NICE SPRING JOB,
HELEN.

13:38.333 --> 13:40.533
DON'T YOU EVER ACCUSE ME
OF HATCHING EVIDENCE.

13:40.599 --> 13:42.566
OH, COME ON.
YOU SAT ON IT,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

13:42.633 --> 13:46.199
GEE, BOBBY,
DID I FALL SHORT OF YOUR
ETHICAL BAR? I'M SORRY.

13:46.266 --> 13:47.166
HEY! HEY!
WE WERE HERE FIRST.

13:47.233 --> 13:48.633
MR. DONNELL,
DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS?

13:48.699 --> 13:50.233
NO COMMENT.
NO COMMENT.

13:50.299 --> 13:52.799
WE CAN'T NOT INTRODUCE
THE SHOE PRINT, HELEN.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.133
I WANT TO HOLD IT
FOR REBUTTAL.

13:54.199 --> 13:55.999
REBUTTAL? WINSLOW MIGHT
NOT EVEN TAKE THE STAND.

13:56.066 --> 13:57.466
I'LL TAKE THAT BET.

13:57.533 --> 13:59.166
HELEN, WE DON'T HAVE
THE GREATEST CASE HERE.

13:59.233 --> 14:01.633
EXACTLY. WE DON'T HAVE
THE GREATEST CASE.

14:01.699 --> 14:02.799
WE NEED TO CATCH HIM
IN A LIE.

14:02.866 --> 14:05.199
WHICH WE CAN'T DO
IF HE DOESN'T TESTIFY.

14:05.266 --> 14:06.766
SCOTT.

14:06.833 --> 14:08.166
HOW WE DOING?

14:10.699 --> 14:12.533
WE CAN'T LOSE
THIS ONE, HELEN.

14:22.066 --> 14:24.266
ALL RIGHT, DNA IS NEXT.

14:24.333 --> 14:25.499
WE HAVE NOTHING
TO FEAR THERE.

14:25.566 --> 14:28.566
LET THEM TALK.
NOBODY FIDGETS
OR LOOKS WORRIED.

14:28.633 --> 14:30.799
IF ANYTHING, LOOK BORED.
SEND A MESSAGE TO THE JURY

14:30.866 --> 14:32.133
THIS STUFF DOESN'T MATTER.

14:32.199 --> 14:35.933
DOES ANYONE HERE
BESIDES ME
THINK HE DID IT?

14:39.033 --> 14:41.299
I'M SORRY,
BUT DOES ANYONE HERE

14:41.366 --> 14:42.633
EVEN HAVE A THEORY

14:42.699 --> 14:44.733
AS TO WHO ELSE--
KAREN.

14:44.799 --> 14:46.299
WHAT, JEFFREY? WHAT?

14:47.899 --> 14:49.866
I KNOW YOU HAVE
EVERY RIGHT TO DOUBT ME.

14:49.933 --> 14:51.033
OH, YOU'RE WRONG, JEFFREY.

14:51.099 --> 14:53.533
I DON'T DOUBT YOU
FOR A SECOND.

14:53.599 --> 14:55.433
OK, SO WE HAVE
SOME EXCITEMENT HERE.
LOOK, KAREN--

14:55.499 --> 14:58.166
AND DON'T YOU GIVE ME
THAT DEVOTED WIFE PITCH
AGAIN.

14:59.833 --> 15:02.166
KAREN, WHY DON'T YOU AND I
GO TAKE A BREAK?

15:10.666 --> 15:11.599
GREAT.

15:22.499 --> 15:25.066
WE HAVE TO DECIDE
WHETHER YOU'RE
GOING TO TESTIFY.

15:26.833 --> 15:28.566
DO YOU THINK
HE KILLED HER?

15:29.999 --> 15:31.433
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.799
I'M SORRY. SITTING
IN THAT ROOM TODAY,
LISTENING...

15:35.866 --> 15:37.299
KAREN, I KNOW. THIS--

15:37.366 --> 15:38.299
I CAN'T DO IT.

15:39.833 --> 15:42.499
I CAN'T PLAY
THE ADORING WIFE
ANYMORE.

15:42.566 --> 15:44.066
EVER SINCE
THIS HAPPENED,

15:44.133 --> 15:46.733
I'VE BEEN PRETENDING
THAT I STAND BY HIM,

15:46.799 --> 15:48.066
THAT I...

15:51.899 --> 15:54.033
I FEEL DIRTY...

15:54.099 --> 15:57.333
WALKING IN THE ROOM
WITH HIM,

15:57.399 --> 15:58.466
HOLDING HIS HAND.

16:00.499 --> 16:04.399
HE BETRAYED ME,
AND I CAN'T PRETEND
ANYMORE.

16:04.466 --> 16:06.199
KAREN, LISTEN TO ME.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.533
WE HAVE A MURDER TRIAL,
AND WE HAVE A MARRIAGE,

16:08.599 --> 16:10.966
AND, UNFORTUNATELY,
FOR THE SAKE OF THE TRIAL,

16:11.033 --> 16:13.199
WE HAVE TO SEND A SIGNAL
THAT THE MARRIAGE IS OK.

16:13.266 --> 16:15.333
THIS TELLS
THE JURY SOMETHING.

16:17.033 --> 16:22.933
IF YOU BELIEVE
THAT HE'S INNOCENT,
MURDER-WISE...

16:22.999 --> 16:24.833
THEN YOU HAVE TO
PRETEND MARRIAGE-WISE

16:24.899 --> 16:27.166
JUST FOR
A LITTLE BIT LONGER,
KAREN.

16:30.499 --> 16:31.433
OK.

16:33.166 --> 16:35.033
OK.

16:36.966 --> 16:39.733
THEY NEVER ACTUALLY
CHECKED OUT THE MOTHER.
AT LEAST NOT MUCH.

16:39.799 --> 16:43.233
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT SHE COULD DECAPITATE
HER OWN DAUGHTER?

16:43.299 --> 16:46.433
NO, BUT THEY DIDN'T
LIKE EACH OTHER.

16:46.499 --> 16:48.133
AND, BOBBY, NOW THAT
THE SURGEON STUFF
IS IN,

16:48.199 --> 16:50.366
WE MIGHT HAVE
TO START SUGGESTING
OTHER SUSPECTS.

16:50.433 --> 16:51.933
NO, IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.
BURDEN'S ON THEM.

16:51.999 --> 16:53.733
WE DON'T OFFER
ANYTHING WE CAN'T PROVE.

16:53.799 --> 16:56.999
YEAH. WELL, OUR CONSULTANTS
SAY WE HAVE TO RESPOND
TO THE THREATS, TOO.

16:57.066 --> 16:58.933
ADMISSIBLE OR NOT,
THEY THINK IT'S A PROBLEM.

16:58.999 --> 17:01.266
WHICH MEANS JEFFREY
WOULD HAVE TO TESTIFY,

17:01.333 --> 17:03.299
WHICH IS WHAT
I THINK HELEN WANTS.

17:06.532 --> 17:07.465
WHAT?

17:09.933 --> 17:11.165
I DON'T KNOW.

17:13.933 --> 17:15.299
SOMETHING'S FUNNY.

17:17.233 --> 17:19.266
IT'S RIGHT IN FRONT
OF OUR FACES.

17:22.633 --> 17:24.266
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

17:29.874 --> 17:33.374
AS YOU CAN SEE,
THE NUCLEOTIDES LINK UP.

17:33.441 --> 17:36.941
WE HAVE AN EXACT
GENETIC MATCH-UP
WITH THE DEFENDANT.

17:37.008 --> 17:39.074
AND THIS WAS
FROM SKIN SAMPLES?

17:39.141 --> 17:41.308
FOUND UNDERNEATH
HER FINGERNAILS, YES.

17:41.374 --> 17:43.074
THE HAIR SAMPLES
FOUND ON THE BED

17:43.141 --> 17:46.641
ALSO LINE UP IN
MATCHING SEQUENCES.

17:46.708 --> 17:50.074
DOCTOR, CAN YOU
CRUNCH ALL THIS FOR US?

17:50.141 --> 17:52.241
THE DEFENDANT
WAS IN HER APARTMENT.

17:52.308 --> 17:55.441
BUT DNA CAN'T ESTABLISH
THAT HE KILLED HER,

17:55.508 --> 17:58.408
ONLY THAT HE WAS THERE.

17:58.474 --> 17:59.308
YES.

17:59.374 --> 18:01.808
IT WAS A PRIOR VICTIM
OF THE POET.

18:01.874 --> 18:04.741
AND, DR. NOFFLE,
THE DEFENDANT HAD ACCESS

18:04.808 --> 18:07.241
TO THE AUTOPSY REPORT
ON THIS WOMAN?

18:07.308 --> 18:08.741
YES, HE DID.

18:08.808 --> 18:10.974
BECAUSE IT WAS
A PRIOR VICTIM
OF THE POET,

18:11.041 --> 18:14.408
THE AUTOPSY REPORT WAS
FAXED ALL OVER YOUR HOSPITAL,
WASN'T IT?

18:14.474 --> 18:17.074
IT WAS JUICY COPY,
AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAD IT.

18:17.141 --> 18:18.241
YES.

18:18.308 --> 18:19.908
DO THE HOSPITAL
PHONE RECORDS

18:19.974 --> 18:23.274
SHOW ANY OUTGOING CALL
TO DR. WINSLOW'S RESIDENCE

18:23.341 --> 18:24.608
THE EVENING OF THE MURDER?

18:24.674 --> 18:25.841
Hospital
administrator: NO.

18:25.908 --> 18:28.108
AND IF SOMEBODY DID CALL
HIM DOWN TO THE HOSPITAL,

18:28.174 --> 18:30.174
YOUR PHONE RECORDS
WOULD INDICATE THIS?

18:30.241 --> 18:31.341
YES.

18:31.408 --> 18:34.608
ANYBODY IN THE HOSPITAL
HAVE PERSONAL CELL PHONES?

18:34.674 --> 18:35.908
YES.

18:37.841 --> 18:39.808
Judge Hiller:
IS THAT IT, MISS GAMBLE?

18:41.508 --> 18:43.408
PUT THE SHOE IN
NOW, HELEN.

18:43.474 --> 18:45.474
IF WINSLOW
DOESN'T TESTIFY,
THEY COULD REST.

18:45.541 --> 18:48.608
REASONABLE DOUBT.
WE HAVE NOT MADE
OUR CASE.

18:48.674 --> 18:52.274
PROSECUTION WOULD LIKE
TO CALL ONE LAST WITNESS.

18:54.941 --> 18:55.841
KENNETH FULLER.

18:57.441 --> 18:59.474
Bobby: YOUR HONOR,
THIS WITNESS IS NOT
ON THEIR LIST.

18:59.541 --> 19:01.908
HE WAS INCLUDED
IN A PRIOR PRETRIAL LIST.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.274
WHICH HAD
200 NAMES ON IT.

19:03.341 --> 19:04.841
GET UP HERE,
BOTH OF YOU.

19:09.008 --> 19:10.374
TECHNICALLY,
THEY HAD NOTICE.

19:10.441 --> 19:12.941
WE DID NOT.
THIS IS A REVISED LIST.

19:13.008 --> 19:14.074
AS AN OFFICER
OF THIS COURT,

19:14.141 --> 19:15.241
I WILL STATE
RIGHT NOW

19:15.308 --> 19:16.541
THAT NOTHING
I ASK THIS WITNESS

19:16.608 --> 19:18.041
WILL CONSTITUTE
UNFAIR SURPRISE.

19:18.108 --> 19:19.041
THE TESTIMONY
COULD BE WORTHLESS.

19:19.108 --> 19:20.141
THEN WHY BOTHER?

19:20.208 --> 19:21.308
BECAUSE I'M
PLAYING A HUNCH.

19:21.374 --> 19:23.441
I'M ENTITLED TO DO THAT.

19:23.508 --> 19:24.441
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL SEE WHERE IT GOES.

19:24.508 --> 19:25.608
Bobby: YOUR HONOR,
THIS IS--

19:25.674 --> 19:28.208
IF YOU WANT TO ADJOURN
AFTER TO PREPARE CROSS,

19:28.274 --> 19:29.108
I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU.

19:29.174 --> 19:30.441
STOP YOUR WHINING.

19:33.674 --> 19:35.408
MR. FULLER...

19:38.674 --> 19:40.541
WE'VE ALREADY LEARNED
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOU

19:40.608 --> 19:42.174
FROM YOUR EX-MOTHER-IN-LAW.

19:42.241 --> 19:44.108
YOU HAD A BAD MARRIAGE
WITH CINDY MARKS?

19:44.174 --> 19:45.741
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

19:45.808 --> 19:48.908
FORGIVE ME
FOR SAYING THIS,
SIR, BUT...

19:48.974 --> 19:50.441
YOU SEEM LIKE A SCARY GUY.

19:50.508 --> 19:51.808
OBJECTION.
OBJECTION.
OBJECTION.

19:51.874 --> 19:55.008
SUSTAINED. IS THAT
WHERE YOU'RE GOING?
HE LOOKS SCARY?

19:55.074 --> 19:56.808
ACTUALLY, YES.

19:56.874 --> 19:58.774
MR. FULLER,

19:58.841 --> 20:01.374
YOU'VE BEEN IN THIS COURTROOM
EVERY DAY OF THE TRIAL.

20:01.441 --> 20:03.208
ANYBODY ASK YOU TO COME?

20:03.274 --> 20:04.241
OBJECTION.

20:04.308 --> 20:05.474
OVERRULED.

20:05.541 --> 20:08.041
ANYBODY PERHAPS PAY YOU
TO BE SITTING HERE?

20:08.108 --> 20:09.241
OBJECTION. WORK PRODUCT.

20:09.308 --> 20:10.541
WORK PRODUCT?

20:10.608 --> 20:12.541
YOUR HONOR,
SHE IS GOING FISHING.

20:12.608 --> 20:13.574
SHE'S TRYING TO GET
A COMMUNICATIONS

20:13.641 --> 20:15.708
BETWEEN THE WITNESS
AND MY OFFICE.

20:15.774 --> 20:17.241
IT'S WORK PRODUCT,
AND IT'S INADMISSIBLE.

20:17.308 --> 20:19.808
I THINK I'D LIKE
TO ASK MYSELF.

20:21.774 --> 20:23.308
Judge Hiller:
HAS ANYONE PAID YOU

20:23.374 --> 20:24.908
TO COME HERE, MR. FULLER?

20:27.274 --> 20:28.508
YOU'RE UNDER OATH, SIR.

20:28.574 --> 20:31.274
HAS ANYONE PAID YOU
TO COME TO THIS COURTROOM?

20:33.341 --> 20:34.808
MR. BERLUTI.

20:36.074 --> 20:36.974
HIM.

20:39.874 --> 20:40.808
HOW MUCH?

20:43.041 --> 20:44.308
$5,000.

20:44.374 --> 20:46.208
[CROWD MUTTERING]

20:48.308 --> 20:51.141
AND WERE YOU GIVEN
ANY SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS?

20:51.208 --> 20:53.541
JUST SIT HERE...

20:53.608 --> 20:55.408
AND LOOK LIKE
I COULD HAVE KILLED HER.

21:00.608 --> 21:02.874
I HAVE A LEGAL RIGHT--
LIKE HELL YOU DO!

21:02.941 --> 21:05.241
WE ALL HAVE OUR
PAID CONSULTANTS
SITTING OUT THERE,

21:05.308 --> 21:06.941
PAID TO SIT
IN THE ROOM.

21:07.008 --> 21:08.074
ARE YOU KIDDING?

21:08.141 --> 21:09.241
NO, I'M NOT KIDDING,
HELEN.

21:09.308 --> 21:10.808
WELL, YOU SHOULD BE.

21:10.874 --> 21:13.974
PAYING THAT MAN
TO SIT THERE AS
A FLAME-RED HERRING,

21:14.041 --> 21:16.608
IT'S THE EQUIVALENT
OF PUTTING IN
FALSE EVIDENCE.

21:16.674 --> 21:18.908
I DIDN'T CALL HIM
TO THE STAND.

21:18.974 --> 21:20.974
WHAT HAS HAPPENED
TO YOU?

21:21.041 --> 21:24.608
LOOK, I'M DOING
WHAT I HAVE TO DO
TO DEFEND MY CLIENT.

21:24.674 --> 21:26.608
I HAVEN'T BROKEN
ANY LAWS HERE,

21:26.674 --> 21:29.274
AND I DEMAND YOU
INSTRUCT THAT JURY
THAT I HAVEN'T.

21:29.341 --> 21:30.708
I'M NOT GOING
TO DO THAT.

21:30.774 --> 21:33.108
THEN, BASICALLY,
YOU JUST CONDEMNED ME
IN FRONT OF THEM.

21:33.174 --> 21:36.241
AND I'D DO IT AGAIN,
AND I'D LOVE TO DO
IT MORE DIRECTLY,

21:36.308 --> 21:39.041
BUT I DON'T WANT
TO HAND YOU
A MISTRIAL.

21:39.108 --> 21:41.974
THAT LITTLE TRICK
WAS DESPICABLE.

21:42.041 --> 21:43.241
YOU DON'T THINK
SHE DOES THAT?

21:43.308 --> 21:45.408
I'M TALKING NOW!
DESPICABLE!

21:45.474 --> 21:49.208
YOU'RE RIGHT.
TECHNICALLY, YOU
GET TO SLIDE BY,

21:49.274 --> 21:52.674
BUT BARELY, BOBBY!

21:54.308 --> 21:55.408
BARELY!

21:56.341 --> 21:58.408
YOU TOLD HER!
I DIDN'T TELL HER!

21:58.474 --> 22:00.974
HOW COULD SHE
JUST PLUCK THAT
OUT OF THE SKY?

22:01.041 --> 22:02.941
SHE'S SMART,
AND DON'T YOU
OH, PLEASE!ACCUSE ME--

22:03.008 --> 22:05.441
IT WAS A STUPID STUNT.
SERVES YOU RIGHT IT
BACKFIRED.

22:05.508 --> 22:07.474
THANK YOU, REBECCA.
YOU WANNA TAKE OVER
THE CASE NOW?

22:07.541 --> 22:10.308
IT WAS STUPID.
YOU HAD THE CASE WON,
AND YOU KNOW YOU DID.

22:10.374 --> 22:13.374
AND NOW? THAT JURY WON'T
TRUST A THING YOU SAY,
AND WHY SHOULD THEY?

22:13.441 --> 22:16.074
Eugene: ALL RIGHT!
LET'S NOT TURN
ON EACH OTHER.

22:16.141 --> 22:19.508
THEIR CASE HASN'T
GOTTEN ANY BETTER, AND
THE BURDEN IS ON THEM.

22:19.574 --> 22:21.474
WELL,
WE CERTAINLY CAN'T
REST ON THAT NOTE.

22:21.541 --> 22:23.608
NO, WE CAN'T.
WE GOTTA PUT ON
A DEFENSE.

22:23.674 --> 22:25.174
IS KAREN READY?

22:25.241 --> 22:27.441
YEAH.

22:30.474 --> 22:33.308
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT TIME YOUR HUSBAND
LEFT THE HOUSE?

22:33.374 --> 22:35.008
A FEW MINUTES
PAST 10:00.

22:35.074 --> 22:36.208
AND WHEN HE RETURNED?

22:36.274 --> 22:37.274
AROUND MIDNIGHT.

22:37.341 --> 22:38.908
I WAS STILL AWAKE.

22:38.974 --> 22:41.541
CAN YOU PLEASE
DESCRIBE HIS DEMEANOR
FOR THE COURT?

22:41.608 --> 22:43.341
IT WAS NORMAL.
HE COMPLAINED

22:43.408 --> 22:45.041
THAT THE PAGE
WAS UNNECESSARY,

22:45.108 --> 22:46.774
THAT IT COULD'VE
WAITED TILL MORNING.

22:46.841 --> 22:48.241
BUT HE WAS CALM.
YES.

22:48.308 --> 22:49.574
HIS USUAL SELF?

22:49.641 --> 22:50.574
YES.

22:50.641 --> 22:52.674
CAN YOU TELL US
HOW LONG IT TAKES

22:52.741 --> 22:55.508
TO GET FROM WESTON
TO MASS GENERAL WHERE
YOUR HUSBAND WORKS?

22:55.574 --> 22:57.941
AT THAT HOUR,
YOU CAN MAKE IT IN
ABOUT 35 MINUTES.

22:58.008 --> 23:00.941
SO, HE WOULD NEED
AN HOUR AND 10 MINUTES
TRAVEL TIME?

23:01.008 --> 23:01.974
RIGHT.

23:05.274 --> 23:08.574
MRS. WINSLOW, ARE YOU
ANGRY AT YOUR HUSBAND?

23:10.974 --> 23:14.408
I DON'T KNOW IF ANGER
IS A STRONG ENOUGH WORD.

23:16.874 --> 23:19.174
DO I LOVE HIM?

23:19.241 --> 23:20.808
YES.

23:20.874 --> 23:23.808
BUT DO I ALSO
HATE HIM?

23:25.708 --> 23:27.308
YES.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.741
BUT DESPITE
YOUR ANGRY FEELINGS,

23:30.808 --> 23:34.341
HERE, TODAY, YOU SIT,
TESTIFYING ON HIS BEHALF.

23:34.408 --> 23:38.041
I'VE SLEPT BY
THAT MAN'S SIDE
FOR 12 YEARS.

23:38.108 --> 23:41.608
I KNOW HIM AS WELL
AS I KNOW MYSELF.

23:41.674 --> 23:44.274
IT IS INCONCEIVABLE
THAT HE COULD'VE
COMMITTED

23:44.341 --> 23:47.208
WHAT HE'S BEEN
ACCUSED OF.

23:47.274 --> 23:49.708
YOU SEEM PRETTY SURE.

23:49.774 --> 23:54.541
WHATEVER HIS FAULTS,
HE'S NOT A MURDERER.

23:55.774 --> 23:57.541
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

24:04.174 --> 24:05.874
YOU SAY YOU KNOW HIM.

24:05.941 --> 24:08.974
YOU DIDN'T KNOW HE
WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR
THOUGH, DID YOU?

24:09.041 --> 24:10.841
NO.

24:10.908 --> 24:14.174
SO HE IS ABLE TO
CONCEAL CERTAIN TRUTHS
FROM YOU, ISN'T HE?

24:14.241 --> 24:15.941
HE DIDN'T KILL
THAT WOMAN.

24:16.008 --> 24:19.574
WHO IS THIS PERSON
SITTING IN THE SECOND ROW
BY THE AISLE?

24:19.641 --> 24:21.208
BEVERLY WALTON.
SHE'S MY NEIGHBOR.

24:21.274 --> 24:22.974
THE DAY OF YOUR
HUSBAND'S ARREST,

24:23.041 --> 24:28.041
DID YOU TELL HER YOU
THOUGHT YOUR HUSBAND
DID KILL CINDY MARKS?

24:28.108 --> 24:29.808
DID YOU TELL
BEVERLY WALTON

24:29.874 --> 24:33.674
YOU THOUGHT
YOUR HUSBAND DID
MURDER CINDY MARKS?

24:35.141 --> 24:37.741
I WAS STILL IN SHOCK
OVER THE AFFAIR.

24:37.808 --> 24:40.974
I WAS SPEAKING OUT
OF HURT AND ANGER.

24:41.041 --> 24:42.174
YOU DID SAY THAT.

24:42.241 --> 24:44.508
I WAS LASHING OUT.
I DIDN'T MEAN--

24:44.574 --> 24:47.074
YOU SIT HERE TODAY,
SAYING IT'S INCONCEIVABLE

24:47.141 --> 24:48.841
FOR YOUR HUSBAND
TO COMMIT MURDER,

24:48.908 --> 24:52.608
AND YET, TO THIS WOMAN,
YOU SAID HE PROBABLY
DID COMMIT MURDER.

24:52.674 --> 24:54.374
I DON'T THINK
HE KILLED HER.

24:54.441 --> 24:55.574
THERE WAS
A CONTEXT--

24:55.641 --> 24:58.141
THAT WAS JUST A SLIP
OF THE TONGUE THEN?

24:58.208 --> 25:00.408
OBJECTION.
SUSTAINED.

25:00.474 --> 25:03.408
MRS. WINSLOW, YOU ALSO
TESTIFIED TO TIMELINE--

25:03.474 --> 25:06.341
2 HOURS, 10:00 TO MIDNIGHT,
HOUR COMMUTE.

25:06.408 --> 25:10.908
DO YOU REMEMBER SPEAKING
WITH ME AND DETECTIVE McKREW
THE DAY AFTER THE MURDER?

25:10.974 --> 25:12.008
YES.

25:12.074 --> 25:13.341
DID YOU NOT
TELL US THEN

25:13.408 --> 25:15.808
THAT YOUR HUSBAND
RETURNED HOME
AROUND 1 A.M.?

25:18.041 --> 25:23.274
DID YOU NOT TELL US
YOUR HUSBAND RETURNED
HOME AROUND 1:00?

25:25.508 --> 25:27.808
I WAS WRONG.
IT WAS 12:00.

25:27.874 --> 25:30.708
YOU WERE WRONG?
THE DAY AFTER,
YOU SAID 1:00.

25:30.774 --> 25:34.741
BUT 3 MONTHS LATER,
AT TRIAL, YOUR MEMORY
IS FRESHER?

25:35.674 --> 25:40.108
I DIDN'T REMEMBER
SAYING THAT.

25:40.174 --> 25:41.308
I DIDN'T REMEMBER.

25:41.374 --> 25:43.308
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S NOT PANIC.

25:43.374 --> 25:44.741
WE STILL GOT
A LONG WAY--

25:44.808 --> 25:45.874
"LET'S NOT PANIC"?

25:45.941 --> 25:49.874
MY OWN WIFE SHOUTS
OUT TO SOMEBODY,
"HE DID IT!"

25:49.941 --> 25:51.808
LET'S NOT PANIC?

25:53.641 --> 25:57.841
DID YOU KILL HER?
YOU DID, DIDN'T YOU?
YOU KILLED HER.

25:57.908 --> 25:59.508
EXCUSE ME?

25:59.574 --> 26:00.741
YOU RETAIN
EVERYTHING, KAREN.

26:00.808 --> 26:02.341
YOU WOULDN'T FORGET

26:02.408 --> 26:04.341
SAYING, "HE DID IT"
TO BEVERLY!

26:04.408 --> 26:07.941
YOU WOULDN'T
FORGET SAYING,
"ABOUT 1 A.M."

26:09.674 --> 26:11.808
MAYBE YOU DID KNOW
ABOUT THE AFFAIR.

26:11.874 --> 26:14.908
WHAT A PERFECT
REVENGE THAT WOULD
BE, WOULDN'T IT?

26:14.974 --> 26:16.908
ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR MIND?

26:16.974 --> 26:18.341
MAYBE I AM!

26:18.408 --> 26:20.874
ALL OF THIS
PRETENDING TO
BE BY MY SIDE,

26:20.941 --> 26:25.274
AND THEN YOU
GET UP THERE ON
THE STAND AND...

26:30.808 --> 26:33.841
NOW, MAYBE YOU--
MAYBE YOU WENT
UP THERE,

26:33.908 --> 26:38.541
KNOWING FULL WELL
THAT THE D.A.
WOULD PICK YOU TO
PIECES ON CROSS.

26:38.608 --> 26:42.408
OH-HO, OOH, PERFECT,
KAREN, PERFECT.

26:43.608 --> 26:47.874
OH...OH...
OH, I GET IT.

26:47.941 --> 26:52.408
I'M SUPPOSED TO THINK,
"WOW, FOR HIM TO ACCUSE ME,

26:52.474 --> 26:54.408
HE REALLY MUST BE
INNOCENT."

26:54.474 --> 26:56.608
THAT WHAT YOU
WANT ME TO THINK?

26:56.674 --> 27:00.741
THAT WHAT
THIS LITTLE TANTRUM
IS ABOUT?

27:08.874 --> 27:11.841
THE TRIAL HAS BEEN SUSPENDED
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY,

27:11.908 --> 27:15.541
BUT TOMORROW WILL BE THE DAY
EVERYONE HAS BEEN SALIVATING
FOR--

27:15.608 --> 27:18.808
JEFFREY WINSLOW IS SCHEDULED TO
CLIMB INTO THAT WITNESS CHAIR.

27:24.774 --> 27:25.674
WHERE IS HE?

27:25.741 --> 27:27.908
WITH JIMMY
AND EUGENE--
MOCK TESTIMONY.

27:27.974 --> 27:30.508
BOBBY, HAVE
WE EVEN THOUGHT
ABOUT A PLEA?

27:30.574 --> 27:33.708
A PLEA? THEY
STILL HAVEN'T MADE
THEIR CASE. WHY--

27:36.141 --> 27:40.341
BEC, YOU PROBABLY
HAVE MOST DISTANCE.
WHERE'S YOUR HEAD?

27:40.408 --> 27:42.608
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT,
I DON'T KNOW,

27:42.674 --> 27:45.241
BUT I DEFINITELY THINK
THE GUY DID IT.

27:45.308 --> 27:47.208
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST
THROW OUT A FEELER,

27:47.274 --> 27:49.808
SEE IF THERE'S
ANYTHING TO
EVEN CONSIDER.

27:54.074 --> 27:55.008
NOT A CHANCE.

27:55.074 --> 27:56.274
YOU HAVE NOT
EVEN COME CLOSE

27:56.341 --> 27:58.008
TO SATISFYING
BURDEN OF PROOF.

27:58.074 --> 27:59.041
THEN WHY ARE
YOU HERE?

27:59.108 --> 28:00.341
BECAUSE THE STAKES
ARE SO HIGH.

28:00.408 --> 28:02.008
MURDER TWO IS
THE BEST YOU GET.

28:02.074 --> 28:04.908
THAT'S AUTOMATIC LIFE.
WHY WOULD WE EVEN
THINK ABOUT THAT?

28:04.974 --> 28:06.074
HE CHOPPED HER
INTO PIECES.

28:06.141 --> 28:07.374
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR,
BATTERY?

28:07.441 --> 28:09.008
SHOULD WE
JUST WRITE HIM A
SPEEDING TICKET?

28:09.074 --> 28:10.341
AND IF YOU DON'T
GET A CONVICTION?

28:10.408 --> 28:12.174
THEN I'LL KNOW YOU
GOT TO A JUROR.

28:12.241 --> 28:13.908
EXCUSE ME?
ALL RIGHT.

28:13.974 --> 28:16.908
THIS IS MORE
ABOUT BEATING ME,
ISN'T IT?

28:16.974 --> 28:19.108
BEATING YOU
IS EXTRA.

28:19.174 --> 28:20.741
HELEN, MAYBE YOU'RE
NOT SEEING STRAIGHT.

28:20.808 --> 28:25.008
YOU HAVEN'T DONE SO GREAT
ON THE ELEMENTS HERE.
YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT.

28:25.074 --> 28:26.441
THEN I'LL LOSE.

28:34.408 --> 28:36.241
I KNOW HELEN GAMBLE
WELL ENOUGH.

28:36.308 --> 28:38.341
SHE'S GOT
ANOTHER CARD
IN HER HAND.

28:38.408 --> 28:40.574
ONLY YOU CAN KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

28:40.641 --> 28:41.474
I DON'T.

28:41.541 --> 28:43.508
YOU SCREW ME,
YOU SCREW YOURSELF!

28:43.574 --> 28:46.241
IF I'M GONNA SAVE YOU
FROM LIFE IN PRISON,

28:46.308 --> 28:50.741
TELL ME WHAT I DON'T KNOW
BECAUSE I GUARANTEE YOU
SHE KNOWS!

28:50.808 --> 28:52.708
TELL ME NOW!

29:00.241 --> 29:01.841
I WENT THERE THAT NIGHT.

29:03.408 --> 29:06.108
I MADE LOVE TO HER
IN THE AFTERNOON,

29:06.174 --> 29:09.941
AND I WENT BACK AT NIGHT...
TO SEE HER...

29:10.008 --> 29:13.974
AND, UM...
I SAW HER LIKE THAT.

29:14.041 --> 29:15.841
LIKE WHAT?

29:15.908 --> 29:18.941
DEAD...ALL CUT UP.

29:20.208 --> 29:21.808
HER HEAD...

29:24.641 --> 29:25.708
I SAW IT.

29:28.608 --> 29:31.408
BUT I DIDN'T--

29:34.208 --> 29:36.141
I JUST LEFT.

29:37.308 --> 29:39.208
I WAS AFRAID.

29:39.274 --> 29:41.741

CALLED THE POLICE,

US TO BE ABLE
TO EXPLAIN IT.

IN REBUTTAL,

30:07.708 --> 30:09.674

30:09.741 --> 30:13.241
