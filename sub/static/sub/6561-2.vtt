00:31.465 --> 00:33.734
IT'S A "SING-CATION."

00:33.801 --> 00:35.169

YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

01:41.302 --> 01:43.471
- CARLOS, FOR THE 11TH TIME--
I'M NOT KIDDING.

01:43.537 --> 01:44.738
YOU ALL THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA GET

01:44.805 --> 01:45.973
THREE MONTHS OFF FROM SCHOOL?

01:46.039 --> 01:47.341
- IT WAS MORE "HOPE"
THAN "THOUGHT."

01:47.408 --> 01:48.842
- ACCORDING TO

01:48.909 --> 01:50.944
THE ACTORS, SINGERS,

01:51.011 --> 01:52.746
KIDS UNDER 18
IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY

01:52.813 --> 01:55.216
MUST ATTEND FOUR HOURS OF SCHOOL
A DAY.

01:55.283 --> 01:56.950
DID YOU EVEN LOOK AT

WHERE'S EVERYBODY GOING?

02:28.982 --> 02:30.951

02:39.960 --> 02:42.763

02:42.830 --> 02:46.066
- TODAY, CLASS, WE'RE GONNA
LEARN ABOUT FRACTIONS.

02:46.133 --> 02:47.901
AND I THOUGHT
A FUN WAY TO DO THIS

02:47.968 --> 02:50.238
WOULD BE
IF WE DIVIDED UP SOME...

02:50.238 --> 02:51.339
PIES.

02:51.405 --> 02:52.506
all: OOH.

02:52.573 --> 02:53.474
- I LOVE FRACTIONS.

02:53.541 --> 02:54.542
- I LOVE PIE.

02:54.608 --> 02:55.576
- AND AFTER WE CUT THEM,

02:55.643 --> 02:56.910
I GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO EAT THEM.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.579
[all cheering]

02:58.646 --> 03:01.515
- I THINK
WE'RE GONNA LIKE IT HERE.

03:01.582 --> 03:02.783
- OH, NO.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.285
YOU GUYS
AREN'T GOING TO SCHOOL HERE.

03:04.352 --> 03:06.620
- WELL, WHAT SCHOOL
ARE WE GOING TO?

03:06.687 --> 03:07.788
[bell rings]

03:07.855 --> 03:10.758
- WELCOME

03:10.824 --> 03:12.393

03:12.460 --> 03:13.527

03:13.594 --> 03:14.695

INSTEAD OF LUNCH BREAK,

03:21.735 --> 03:24.705
THE SCHOOL OF ROCQUE
HAS HARMONY BREAKS.

03:24.772 --> 03:28.276
AND EVERY FIELD TRIP IS TO
THE DANCE STUDIO DOWN THE HALL.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.411
- AND YOU'RE OUR TEACHER?

03:30.478 --> 03:31.412
- NO.

03:31.479 --> 03:33.281
[all cheer]

03:33.314 --> 03:36.016
- GUYS, SAY "HI" TO MR. SMITTY.

03:36.083 --> 03:39.052
- BUT YOU ALL CAN CALL ME
"MR. SMITTY."

03:39.119 --> 03:42.022
[adults laugh heartily]

03:42.089 --> 03:43.424
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

03:43.491 --> 03:44.825
I CAN TAKE IT FROM HERE.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.960
OKAY, THEN.
OH, EXCUSE ME.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.496
FIRST UP,

03:48.562 --> 03:50.831
WE HAVE PROBABILITIES--

03:50.898 --> 03:55.035
AS IN THE PROBABILITY
THAT THIS BAND WILL FAIL

03:55.102 --> 03:58.672
BEFORE ITS FIRST SINGLE
IS EVER RELEASED.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.808
- I DON'T THINK
WE'RE GETTING PIE.

04:00.874 --> 04:02.710
thud!

04:02.776 --> 04:04.512
- MOM, I DON'T NEED
HOMESCHOOLING.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.314
I CAN GO TO
THE PALM WOODS SCHOOL.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.382
TYLER SAYS THE TEACHER
IS REALLY COOL.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.150
- HEY, I'M COOL.

04:10.217 --> 04:12.320
AND THIS IS A CHANCE FOR US
TO SPEND TIME TOGETHER.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.754
IN THE FRESH AIR.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.088
SO...

04:15.155 --> 04:17.124
LET'S START WITH MATH.

04:17.190 --> 04:18.792
HMM.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.894
NEGATIVE INTEGERS.

04:20.961 --> 04:25.599
"FIND THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF 'X'

04:25.666 --> 04:27.034
LET'S START WITH HISTORY,

04:27.100 --> 04:30.237
WHERE TODAY WE'LL TALK ABOUT...

04:30.338 --> 04:34.942
THE PELOPONNESIAN WAR?

04:35.008 --> 04:36.344
HI.

04:36.410 --> 04:38.346
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A SCHOOL

WHAT I MEAN IS, I'D LIKE
TO ENROLL KATIE IN THE SCHOOL.

04:43.551 --> 04:45.619
- DOES SHE WORK IN TV?

04:45.686 --> 04:46.987

04:49.222 --> 04:50.624
IN ORDER TO ATTEND OUR SCHOOL,

04:50.691 --> 04:52.593
A STUDENT MUST BE A MEMBER
OF THE UNION.

04:52.660 --> 04:53.961
TO GET INTO THE UNION,

04:54.027 --> 04:56.597
SHE'LL HAVE TO GET A JOB IN TV,
FILM, OR MUSIC.

04:56.664 --> 04:59.132
AND FOR THAT, SHE'LL NEED...

04:59.199 --> 05:03.003
A TALENT MANAGER.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.472
NOW,

05:04.538 --> 05:07.375
I GET 15% OF ALL HER EARNINGS.

05:07.441 --> 05:08.776

05:10.478 --> 05:11.912
HERE'S A LIST

IF SHE LANDS A COMMERCIAL,

05:13.414 --> 05:15.215
SHE GETS INTO THE SCHOOL

05:15.282 --> 05:18.285
AND DADDY GETS SOME
WALKIN'-AROUND MONEY.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.089
snap!

05:22.155 --> 05:26.427
-THE ANSWER IS, "X" EQUALS 9.

05:26.494 --> 05:30.263

I USED TO BE IN A BOY BAND ONCE.

05:30.398 --> 05:32.533
OH,
AND WE THOUGHT WE HAD IT MADE.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.701
HOT SONGS.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.035
FLYING BUSINESS CLASS.

05:35.102 --> 05:37.405

05:37.438 --> 05:39.006
[exasperated groan]

05:39.072 --> 05:40.774
BUT LET ME TELL YOU GUYS

05:40.841 --> 05:44.311

PRETTY FAST.

LET'S GET BACK TO MATH.

05:53.421 --> 05:54.655
SO...

05:54.722 --> 05:56.123
IF FOUR BOYS ARE IN A BAND

05:56.189 --> 05:57.558
MAKING $10,000,

05:57.625 --> 05:59.860
THEIR MANAGER GETS 15%,

05:59.927 --> 06:02.663
THEIR RECORD SALES
PLUMMET 80%,

06:02.730 --> 06:05.733
WHAT PART OF THEIR DREAM

06:05.799 --> 06:06.967
ANYONE?

KELLY, GET THEM ANOTHER TEACHER!

08:50.964 --> 08:56.637

IT DOES IF IT TAKES POOPENUSIL."

09:12.219 --> 09:13.286
- YOU KNOW, SWEETIE,

09:13.353 --> 09:14.655
I THINK
YOU HAVE A CERTAIN QUALITY

09:14.722 --> 09:16.890
THAT NO ONE ELSE HERE HAS.

09:22.930 --> 09:26.233
- I DON'T KNOW IF SHE'S RIGHT
FOR A LAXATIVE COMMERCIAL,

09:26.299 --> 09:27.635
BUT COME BACK TOMORROW.

09:27.635 --> 09:32.239
THEY WANT A CUTE KID
FOR A POTATO CHIP SPOT.

09:32.305 --> 09:33.473
- CAN I FIRE YOU?

09:33.540 --> 09:35.142
- NO, I'M YOUR MOTHER.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.547
- SO...

09:40.648 --> 09:42.549
YOU DIDN'T LIKE
YOUR FIRST TEACHER?

09:42.650 --> 09:44.184
WELL, I DIDN'T LIKE HIM EITHER.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.419
THE MOMENT HE FELT THE HEAT,
HE RAN FOR COVER.

09:46.486 --> 09:47.454
BUT ME?

09:47.520 --> 09:49.222
I'M BATTLE-TESTED.

09:49.289 --> 09:50.457
I HAVE A BLACK BELT,

09:50.523 --> 09:54.094
AND I'M NOT AFRAID
TO HIT YOU WITH IT.

09:54.161 --> 09:56.429
AND THERE IS NOTHING,

09:56.496 --> 10:00.500
NOTHING YOU CAN SAY OR DO

10:00.668 --> 10:05.806
TO GET ME TO LEAVE.

10:05.873 --> 10:07.808
- HERE'S THE KEYS
TO THE PORSCHE OUT FRONT.

10:07.875 --> 10:11.478
LEAVE NOW AND IT'S YOURS.

10:11.544 --> 10:12.980
- KELLY!

10:13.046 --> 10:14.682
HAVE YOU SEEN THE KEYS TO MY--

10:14.748 --> 10:17.150
[engine revving,
tires squealing]

10:17.217 --> 10:21.554
[Gustavo screaming]

10:21.621 --> 10:23.090
- YOU KNOW
HE'S NOT GONNA GIVE UP.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.491
- KELLY,

10:24.557 --> 10:27.260
A PROPER EDUCATION
IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US,

10:27.327 --> 10:29.229
AND THIS IS A SUPPLY CLOSET.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.431
- ATTENTION, STUDENTS.

10:31.498 --> 10:33.767
PLEASE REPORT
TO PRINCIPAL ROCQUE'S OFFICE.

10:33.834 --> 10:36.603
ALL STUDENTS
TO PRINCIPAL ROCQUE'S OFFICE.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.944
- BOYS, I CARE ABOUT YOU.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.412
I DO.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.481
- AND I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU
A STORY FROM MY YOUTH.

10:48.548 --> 10:51.919
MY PRINCIPAL WAS A JERK.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.955
AND I VOWED THAT SOME DAY

10:55.022 --> 10:56.623
I WOULD BE A PRINCIPAL;

10:56.690 --> 10:57.858
A GOOD ONE--

10:57.925 --> 10:59.693
FAIR,

10:59.760 --> 11:01.729
PLEASANT--

11:01.729 --> 11:03.130
- BUT YOU'RE
NONE OF THOSE THINGS.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.733
- HEY!
THINGS DON'T ALWAYS WORK OUT!

11:05.766 --> 11:07.000
BOTTOM LINE IS,

11:07.067 --> 11:09.369
YOU BOYS ARE STAYING
IN THE SCHOOL OF ROCQUE.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.471
END OF STORY.

11:11.538 --> 11:12.740
- BUT, GUSTAVO...

11:12.806 --> 11:13.907
[tapping]

11:13.974 --> 11:15.375
PRINCIPAL ROCQUE.

11:15.442 --> 11:16.509
IT'S JUST,

11:16.576 --> 11:17.978
THIS SCHOOL
ISN'T MEETING OUR SOCIAL

11:18.045 --> 11:19.379
AND EDUCATIONAL NEEDS.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.981
WE NEED TO GO SOMEWHERE
THAT ACTUALLY FEELS

11:21.048 --> 11:22.082
LIKE A REAL SCHOOL.

11:22.149 --> 11:23.751
- WITH GIRLS.
- AND FIELD TRIPS.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.052
- AND PIE!

11:25.118 --> 11:27.888
- YOU GO TO MY SCHOOL;
YOU PLAY BY MY RULES.

11:27.955 --> 11:31.058
AND I WILL FIND A TEACHER
THAT WILL ENFORCE THOSE RULES.

11:31.124 --> 11:35.028
A W.W.E. SUPERSTAR
SUPER TEACHER!

11:35.095 --> 11:36.396
- [laughs]

11:36.463 --> 11:37.597
WHO ARE YOU GONNA GET?

11:37.664 --> 11:39.532
CHRIS "THE MASTERPIECE" MASTERS?

11:39.599 --> 11:44.772
[laughs]

11:44.772 --> 11:49.176
- [screaming]

11:49.242 --> 11:51.178
- I DID NOT SEE THIS COMING.

11:59.652 --> 12:02.455
- OKAY, CLASS,
LET'S GET STARTED.

12:02.522 --> 12:03.891
- IS THAT REALLY CHRIS MASTERS?

12:03.957 --> 12:05.793
- THAT'S RIGHT.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.494
W.W.E. CHAMPION

12:07.560 --> 12:09.662
AND THE ONLY
CERTIFIED A.S.P.A. TEACHER

12:09.797 --> 12:11.799
TRAINED TO USE THE MASTER LOCK.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.000
- THAT'S RIGHT.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.802
AND I BELIEVE
THAT THE KEY TO A SOUND MIND

12:14.868 --> 12:16.169
IS A HEALTHY BODY.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.171
SO THROW YOUR BOOKS AWAY.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.874
THROW YOUR BOOKS AWAY.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.142
ALL RIGHT.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.176
NOW I WANT YOU GUYS
TO LIFT YOUR DESKS.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.244
- EXCUSE ME?

12:24.311 --> 12:27.147
- LIFT YOUR DESKS!

12:27.214 --> 12:29.049
NOW GIVE ME 500 DESK PRESSES!

12:29.116 --> 12:30.017
COUNT THEM OUT!

12:30.083 --> 12:31.151
all: [grunting]

12:31.218 --> 12:32.219
ONE...

12:32.285 --> 12:33.386
TWO...
- UP!

12:33.453 --> 12:34.354
all: THREE...
- UP!

12:34.421 --> 12:36.857
all: FOUR...
[screaming]

12:43.897 --> 12:46.099
- I CAN'T TAKE ANOTHER DAY
AT THE SCHOOL OF ROCQUE.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.835
- I CAN'T MOVE MY ARMS.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.202
- HEY, GUYS!
HIGH FIVE!

12:49.269 --> 12:50.871
[all moan]

12:50.938 --> 12:53.106
- TYLER,
WHAT ARE YOU SO EXCITED ABOUT?

12:53.173 --> 12:58.846
- MISS COLLINS SAYS WE'RE
HAVING CLASS OUTSIDE TODAY!

12:58.846 --> 13:01.114
all: CLASS OUTSIDE...

13:03.851 --> 13:06.019
- ALL RIGHT, CLASS,
IT'S TIME FOR GEOGRAPHY,

13:06.086 --> 13:08.856
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

13:08.856 --> 13:10.390
HAVE FUN!

13:10.457 --> 13:13.326
[all cheering]

13:22.602 --> 13:24.071
girls: COME ON!

13:24.137 --> 13:25.939
COME ON!

13:26.006 --> 13:28.075
COME ON!

13:28.141 --> 13:29.642
- COME ON!

13:29.709 --> 13:31.444
YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR SCHOOL.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.346
- MINE HAD GLOBE BEACH BALLS.

13:33.413 --> 13:34.781
- MINE HAD POOL PIE.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.649
- MINE HAD
A LOW STUDENT-TEACHER RATIO.

13:36.716 --> 13:39.686
- BUT HOW ARE WE GONNA GET RID
OF MR. MASTERPIECE?

13:39.752 --> 13:42.255
- MY MOM PACKED US CORN CHOWDER
FOR LUNCH TODAY, RIGHT?

13:46.193 --> 13:47.160
- KATIE KNIGHT?

13:47.227 --> 13:50.297
KATIE KNIGHT IS NEXT.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.900
- WE ARE GOING TO GET YOU INTO
THAT PALM WOODS SCHOOL TODAY.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.601
SO JUST GO AND BE YOURSELF.

13:54.667 --> 13:55.903
NO, WAIT!
DON'T BE YOURSELF.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.538
BE AN ANGEL WHO LISTENS
AND IS POLITE.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.375
- OKAY, KATIE,

14:02.442 --> 14:03.676
HOLD UP THE BAG OF CHIPS;

14:03.743 --> 14:06.279
LOOK INTO THE CAMERA.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.681
- WHEN YOU HEAR THE CRUNCH,
IT'S A CHIP.

14:08.748 --> 14:12.685
BUT WHEN YOU SMELL THE CRUNCH,
IT'S O'CHIPPIGANS.

14:12.752 --> 14:16.189
AND WHEN YOU SMELL GARBAGE,
IT'S THIS COMMERCIAL.

14:16.256 --> 14:17.557
- EXCUSE ME?

14:17.624 --> 14:19.026
- THIS STUFF IS NOTHING
BUT A HEART ATTACK

14:19.092 --> 14:20.527
THAT GOES GOOD WITH DIP.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.662
I'D BE BETTER OFF
STEPPING IN FRONT OF A BUS...

14:22.729 --> 14:25.565
OF LARD.

14:25.632 --> 14:28.768
- KATIE!

14:28.835 --> 14:31.238
- NOW LET ME JOT DOWN SOMETHING

14:31.304 --> 14:33.440
ON HOW FITNESS AND BODY OIL

14:33.506 --> 14:35.708
HELPS BUILD
A STRONG IMMUNE SYSTEM.

14:47.820 --> 14:50.523
- [retching]

14:50.590 --> 14:52.059
- WHOA. WHOA.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.126
WHOA. WHOA.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.462
- AWESOME: CHUNKY VOMIT!

14:55.528 --> 14:57.230
- HEY, DON'T TOUCH THAT.

14:57.297 --> 14:58.631
DON'T TOUCH THAT.

14:58.698 --> 15:01.068
GERMS!

15:01.134 --> 15:03.703
- OH, GOOD!
- NO.

15:03.770 --> 15:06.673
[all laughing
and shouting indistinctly]

15:06.739 --> 15:08.841
- [screams]

15:13.013 --> 15:15.415
- THOSE KIDS ARE ANIMALS!

15:22.189 --> 15:23.690
thud!

15:23.756 --> 15:26.893
- THE A.S.P.A.
OFFICIAL SCHOOL REGISTRY?

15:26.994 --> 15:30.463
- AND IT'S FILLED WITH
EVERY A.S.P.A.-LICENSED TEACHER

15:30.530 --> 15:33.700
THAT I CAN AND WILL CALL.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.168
EVERY TIME YOU CHASE ONE OFF,

15:35.235 --> 15:39.006
I HAVE 10,000
WAITING IN THE WINGS.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.673
- WHOA!
thud!

15:40.740 --> 15:43.010
- IT'S A BIG BOOK, GUYS.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.012
YOUR NEXT TEACHER
WILL BE HERE IN 30 MINUTES.

15:45.012 --> 15:48.281
- YOU PLAY BY MY RULES.

15:48.348 --> 15:49.582
I WIN!

15:49.649 --> 15:52.219
I'M GOING TO LAUGH
AND LEAVE VICTORIOUS NOW.

15:52.285 --> 15:55.455
[laughs maniacally]

16:00.760 --> 16:03.330
- WELL, I GUESS WE CAN KISS
THE PALM WOODS SCHOOL GOOD-BYE.

16:03.396 --> 16:04.597
- MAYBE NOT.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.133
THIS ISN'T JUST
A LIST OF TEACHERS.

16:06.199 --> 16:09.136
IT ALSO HAS THE RULES EVERY
A.S.P.A. SCHOOL NEEDS TO FOLLOW.

16:09.202 --> 16:12.572
- I SMELL BRAIN.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.108
- OKAY, ACCORDING TO THIS,
WE'RE ENTITLED TO HOT LUNCHES,

16:15.175 --> 16:17.810
OUTDOOR BREAKS, AND
INTERSCHOLASTIC SPORTS PROGRAMS.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.046
- WE DIDN'T GET ANY OF THAT.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.347
- EXACTLY.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.549
SO IF GUSTAVO
WANTS TO HAVE A SCHOOL HERE--

16:22.615 --> 16:24.651
- HE'S GOT TO PLAY
BY THESE RULES.

16:24.717 --> 16:25.852
- I SMELL PLAN.

16:29.922 --> 16:31.124
- KELLY!

16:31.191 --> 16:33.260
WHICH TIE MAKES ME LOOK
MORE PRINCIPALLY?

16:33.326 --> 16:34.727
- THE UGLY ONE.

16:44.737 --> 16:46.073
- OH, HEY, PRINCIPAL ROCQUE.

16:51.278 --> 16:52.245
- HEY!

16:52.312 --> 16:53.613
I HOPE THERE'S A GOOD REASON

16:53.680 --> 16:56.649
MY CONTROL ROOM IS FILLED
WITH YOUR SWEATY SOCKS!

16:56.716 --> 16:59.686
- WELL, A.S.P.A. RULE 209

16:59.752 --> 17:02.455
STATES THAT ALL STUDENTS
MUST HAVE ADEQUATE STORAGE

17:02.522 --> 17:04.091
FOR PERSONAL BELONGINGS.

17:04.091 --> 17:07.160
- WHICH THE SCHOOL OF ROCQUE
HASN'T PROVIDED.

17:07.227 --> 17:08.695
- OH, I DON'T LIKE THE SOUND
OF THIS.

17:22.342 --> 17:23.510
- HEY!

17:23.576 --> 17:26.012
THAT SHELF IS FOR MY AWARDS!

17:26.113 --> 17:27.514
- YOU WOULDN'T
WANT TO BE IN VIOLATION

17:27.580 --> 17:29.682
OF A.S.P.A. RULES, WOULD YOU?

17:29.749 --> 17:34.020
- YOU COULD LOSE YOUR BUSINESS.

17:34.121 --> 17:36.323
- THEY'RE RIGHT.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.891
- FIND A PLACE FOR THE DOGS
TO KEEP THEIR SMELLY STUFF,

17:38.958 --> 17:41.761
WHICH IS NOT IN MY OFFICE!

17:41.828 --> 17:43.663
AND WHERE'S YOUR TEACHER?

17:43.730 --> 17:45.598
- YEAH, WE TOLD HIM
A.S.P.A. ENSURES TEACHERS

17:45.665 --> 17:46.833
FIVE PAID SICK DAYS

17:46.899 --> 17:48.468
AND TWO PERSONAL DAYS A YEAR.

17:48.535 --> 17:52.872
- WHOO-HOO!

17:52.939 --> 17:55.208
SO LONG, SUCKERS!

17:55.275 --> 17:57.177
[laughs]

17:57.244 --> 17:58.911
- SOUNDS LIKE A PERSONAL DAY
TO ME.

17:58.978 --> 18:00.747
- [whimpers]

18:03.783 --> 18:05.218
- "ALL LAUNDRY DETERGENTS
FIGHT STAINS.

18:05.285 --> 18:07.587
BUT FOR SUDS-O, IT'S PERSONAL."

18:07.654 --> 18:08.555
I'M NOT SAYING THIS.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.022
- SAY IT.

18:10.157 --> 18:12.925
WE NEED TO GET YOU
INTO THE PALM WOODS SCHOOL.

18:12.992 --> 18:14.527
- WHY WOULD THEY CAST HER?

18:14.594 --> 18:16.963
SHE COULDN'T SELL BACON
TO A DOG.

18:17.029 --> 18:18.765
- WHAT IF I KICK YOUR BACON?

18:18.831 --> 18:21.201
- DON'T STOOP TO HIS LEVEL,
HONEY.

18:21.268 --> 18:22.402
KIDS.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.837
- WELL, I THINK
SHE'S JUST ADORABLE,

18:24.904 --> 18:26.173
THE WAY SHE THINKS
SHE HAS A CHANCE

18:26.173 --> 18:28.441
AGAINST MY ELLIOT.

18:28.508 --> 18:31.944
I MEAN, LOOK AT HER.

18:32.011 --> 18:33.446
- OH, IT'S ON!

18:33.513 --> 18:36.283
- [growls]

18:36.349 --> 18:38.017
- YOUR MOM IS A FREAK!

18:38.084 --> 18:39.852
- [grunts]

18:39.919 --> 18:41.354
PILE DRIVER!

18:41.421 --> 18:42.755
thud!

18:42.822 --> 18:45.057
[all grunting]

18:45.192 --> 18:46.893
TAKE IT BACK!
- UNCLE!

18:46.959 --> 18:48.795
- OKAY, NEXT UP
IS KATIE KNIGHT.

18:48.861 --> 18:51.764
KATIE?

18:51.831 --> 18:54.000
[grunting stops abruptly]

18:54.066 --> 18:57.069
- SHE'S NOT GETTING THE PART,
IS SHE?

18:58.838 --> 19:00.072
- KEEP LOOKING!

19:00.207 --> 19:01.208
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING
IN THIS BOOK

19:01.208 --> 19:02.409
THAT WILL MAKE ME WIN.

19:02.475 --> 19:03.810
- I'M READING THROUGH IT
FOR THE FOURTH TIME!

19:03.876 --> 19:05.212
- READ HARDER!

19:05.278 --> 19:06.913
- JUST LET THEM GO TO SCHOOL
AT THE PALM WOODS.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.748
- THE DAY I LET THEM BEAT ME
IS THE DAY I--

19:08.815 --> 19:09.782
IS THAT A GOAT?

19:09.849 --> 19:11.251
- [bleats]

19:11.318 --> 19:12.552
[bleating continues]

19:12.619 --> 19:14.654
- EVERY A.S.P.A. SCHOOL

19:14.721 --> 19:18.325
HAS THE RIGHT
TO A SCHOOL MASCOT.

19:18.391 --> 19:22.662
[basketball horn blows]

19:22.729 --> 19:25.298
- YOU ARE FAMILIAR
WITH A.S.P.A.'S STANCE

19:25.365 --> 19:27.234
ON INTERSCHOLASTIC ATHLETICS,
RIGHT?

19:27.234 --> 19:28.235
- HUH?

19:28.235 --> 19:29.469
- DID YOU SEE OUR GOAT?

19:29.536 --> 19:30.603
- [bleats]

19:30.670 --> 19:31.871
WE CALL HIM GUS.

19:31.938 --> 19:32.972
GUS TAVO.

19:33.039 --> 19:33.940
