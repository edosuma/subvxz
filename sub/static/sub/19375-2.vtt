BUT, YOU KNOW,
I'M HERE TO SELL IT.

38:07.896 --> 38:10.758
IT TAKES UP A LOT OF SPACE HERE,
SO I DON'T KNOW.

38:10.758 --> 38:12.724
HOW ABOUT 50?

38:12.724 --> 38:14.586
I KNOW I CAN'T BUILD IT
ANYWHERE NEAR THAT.

38:14.586 --> 38:16.517
NO WAY.

38:16.517 --> 38:17.655
ALL RIGHT, I'LL DO 50.

38:17.655 --> 38:19.620
KILLER, RIGHT ON, MAN.

38:19.620 --> 38:21.068
GOOD JOB, GUYS.

38:21.068 --> 38:23.344
SO I HIT HIM WITH AROUND 60
JUST TO SEE WHERE HE WAS AT.

38:23.344 --> 38:24.931
WE SETTLED ON 50 GRAND.

38:24.931 --> 38:26.413
I THINK THAT'S ALL OF IT.

38:26.413 --> 38:28.517
I DON'T THINK I COULD HAVE GOT
ANY BETTER AT AN AUCTION,

38:28.517 --> 38:30.551
AND I THINK HE WAS THE BUYER.

38:30.551 --> 38:32.724
AS THEY SAY, THERE'S AN ASS
FOR EVERY SEAT.

38:32.724 --> 38:34.448
DAVID IS THAT ASS TODAY.

38:34.448 --> 38:36.448
LET'S GO DO SOME PAPERWORK,
AND THEN YOU'RE REALLY GOING

38:36.448 --> 38:38.344
TO JUMP IN IT RIGHT NOW
AND GO TO MISSISSIPPI?

38:38.344 --> 38:40.137
YEAH.
WHY DO YOU THINK I BOUGHT IT?

38:40.137 --> 38:41.448
THAT IS SO BADASS.

38:41.448 --> 38:42.724
I WISH I HAD TIME
TO DO COOL THINGS.

38:42.724 --> 38:50.448
♪♪

38:50.448 --> 38:52.896
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T SIT ON IT.
IT SAYS, "DO NOT STACK."

38:52.896 --> 38:55.137
IF MY MOM SAW THIS,
I WOULD BE DEAD.

38:55.137 --> 38:57.103
HEY, IF YOUR MOM SAW THIS,
I'D BE DEAD.

38:57.103 --> 39:00.137
I AIN'T GOT NO HANDS ON IT.
WHOA!

39:00.137 --> 39:02.068
FOUND THE KEY.

39:02.068 --> 39:04.758
WE'RE A LITTLE OVER A WEEK
INTO THE BUILD ON THE '79 SCOUT,

39:04.758 --> 39:07.137
AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE TAKING
A 707-HORSEPOWER

39:07.137 --> 39:08.689
HELLCRATE MOTOR OFF THE SHELF

39:08.689 --> 39:09.931
BECAUSE RICHARD PULLED
SOME STRINGS

39:09.931 --> 39:11.931
TO GET THE EIGHT-SPEED TRANNY.

39:11.931 --> 39:13.413
NOW WE CAN FINALLY MARRY
THE TWO TOGETHER

39:13.413 --> 39:16.655
AND DO A MOCK STUB
OF THE DRIVETRAIN.

39:16.655 --> 39:19.137
-LET'S DO THIS.
-GET YOU SOME OF THAT.

39:19.137 --> 39:21.034
THE HELLCRATE, IT'S A BIG DEAL.

39:21.034 --> 39:22.241
IS THIS THE END
THAT THIS POPS OUT?

39:22.241 --> 39:23.310
WHOO-HOO-HOO-HOO-HOO!

39:23.310 --> 39:24.620
-WE HAVE A MOTOR!
-DUDE.

39:24.620 --> 39:26.206
-THAT'S NICE.
-IT TOOK UP THE WHOLE CRATE.

39:26.206 --> 39:28.034
-LOT OF POWER.
-OH, MAN.

39:28.034 --> 39:30.034
THE HELLCRATE IS THE SAME MOTOR
AS THE HELLCAT,

39:30.034 --> 39:31.689
WHICH YOU'LL FIND
IN THE DODGE CHARGER.

39:31.689 --> 39:33.137
ONLY THING IS, THIS BABY
IS MEANT TO BE

39:33.137 --> 39:34.758
RETROFITTED INTO OTHER CARS.

39:34.758 --> 39:36.000
I'M WAITING ON A TRANS.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.724
TRANS GOT HERE THIS MORNING,
SO THAT'S HERE.

39:37.724 --> 39:39.068
-WHERE'S IT AT?
-SWEET.

39:39.068 --> 39:40.965
WELL, THEN I CAN BOLT THE MOTOR
AND TRANS TOGETHER,

39:40.965 --> 39:42.034
AND WHILE YOU GUYS ARE
FINISHING UP THE METALWORKING,

39:42.034 --> 39:43.137
YOU'RE FINISHING UP
YOUR BRACKETS,

39:43.137 --> 39:44.310
WE CAN DROP THAT THING IN.

39:44.310 --> 39:45.586
YEAH, DROP IT IN,
SEE IF IT CLEARS THE FLOOR.

39:45.586 --> 39:46.620
-THAT'D BE AWESOME.
-I'LL SET ALL THEM OUT HERE.

39:46.620 --> 39:48.172
YEAH.

39:48.172 --> 39:50.586
IT'S THE FIRST SUPERCHARGED
FACTORY-DIRECT 707-HORSEPOWER

39:50.586 --> 39:52.448
CRATE ENGINE KIT EVER SOLD.

39:52.448 --> 39:53.965
EVEN COOLER IS
WE'RE GONNA TO BE THE FIRST

39:53.965 --> 39:56.827
TO EVER PUT ONE INTO A SCOUT.

39:56.827 --> 39:58.241
THIS THING WEIGHS A TON.

39:58.241 --> 40:00.103
WE'RE USING AN EIGHT-SPEED
AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION

40:00.103 --> 40:02.103
FROM MOPAR.
IT COMES WITH A TORQUE CONVERTER

40:02.103 --> 40:04.206
FOR LIGHTNING-FAST SHIFTS
AND ACCELERATION.

40:04.206 --> 40:05.931
WE WANT TO DROP IN THE MOTOR
AND TRANSMISSION

40:05.931 --> 40:07.206
TO DO A MOCK-UP
OF HOW IT'S GONNA

40:07.206 --> 40:08.931
SIT INSIDE THE ENGINE BAY

40:08.931 --> 40:10.448
SO WE CAN SEE WHERE WE WANT
TO BUILD OUR MOTOR

40:10.448 --> 40:14.275
AND TRANSMISSION MOUNTS
BEFORE IT ALL GOES OFF TO PAINT.

40:14.275 --> 40:18.448
LOOKING AT THAT, PAN,
THIS CROSSMEMBER.

40:18.448 --> 40:20.965
YEAH, IS THAT MOTOR BACKWARDS
RIGHT NOW?

40:20.965 --> 40:23.793
-HEY, JASON.
-SIR.

40:23.793 --> 40:25.965
NOW THAT WE GOT THE MOTOR ON,
CAN REALLY LOOK AT IT,

40:25.965 --> 40:28.000
AND THE CROSSMEMBER THAT WE HAVE
WITH THE RACK AND PINION

40:28.000 --> 40:29.517
AND EVERYTHING --
-YEAH.

40:29.517 --> 40:32.344
THIS FRONT SUMP PAN
IS NOT GOING TO CLEAR.

40:32.344 --> 40:33.517
-YEAH.
-IT'S NOT GONNA CLEAR.

40:33.517 --> 40:34.517
IT'LL PUT OUR MOTOR
RIGHT THROUGH THE HOOD.

40:34.517 --> 40:35.793
OUR DRIVESHAFT WOULD BE
TOO HIGH.

40:35.793 --> 40:38.827
IT WOULD JUST CREATE
TOO MANY PROBLEMS DOWN THE ROAD.

40:38.827 --> 40:40.655
-THAT IS A PRETTY TALL SUMP.
-YEAH.

40:40.655 --> 40:42.620
WHAT IS IT, LIKE,
6 INCHES TALL?

40:42.620 --> 40:44.379
SO THAT DOES MAKE A LOT OF
DIFFERENCE ON A STEERING RACK.

40:44.379 --> 40:45.793
I DON'T THINK THIS IS
GONNA WORK, DUDE.

40:45.793 --> 40:46.965
WE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE MOTOR
AND TRANSMISSION

40:46.965 --> 40:49.103
IN DAYS AGO, LIKE, DAYS AGO.

40:49.103 --> 40:50.827
WE'RE STARTING TO FEEL
THE STRESS A LITTLE BIT.

40:50.827 --> 40:52.724
IT'S GONNA STINK.

40:52.724 --> 40:54.689
Narrator:
NEXT WEEK ON "FAST N' LOUD"...

40:54.689 --> 40:56.137
YOU'RE LOSING YOUR ASS
BACK THERE.

40:56.137 --> 40:59.172
Narrator: THE MONKEYS RACE TO
FINISH THE SCOUT FROM HELL,

40:59.172 --> 41:02.068
BUT BEING THE FIRST TO PUT
A HELLCRATE ENGINE IN A SCOUT

41:02.068 --> 41:03.655
IS MORE THAN THEY BARGAINED FOR.

41:03.655 --> 41:05.275
ISN'T THIS WHAT
YOU PLANNED IT TO BE?

41:05.275 --> 41:06.827
I DON'T THINK I WANT
BLACK LEATHER.

41:06.827 --> 41:08.344
Narrator:
AND RICHARD'S INTERIOR DESIGN

41:08.344 --> 41:11.241
MIGHT TURN HEADS AND STOMACHS

41:11.241 --> 41:14.551
UNTIL RICHARD FINDS HIMSELF
DEALING WITH AN OLD NEMESIS.

41:14.551 --> 41:15.758
HEY, ASS MONKEY!

41:15.758 --> 41:17.413
YOU GOT TO COME UP
WITH A NEW CATCHPHRASE.

41:17.413 --> 41:20.275
Narrator: PLUS, RICHARD GOES TO
SEE DENNIS FOR A SHOPPING SPREE

41:20.275 --> 41:23.655
AND COMES HOME
WITH A 1963 SPLIT-WINDOW.

41:23.655 --> 41:24.931
Richard:
THIS IS A COOL-ASS CAR.

41:24.931 --> 41:27.275
Narrator: CAN THE MONKEYS
FULFILL RICHARD'S VISION,

41:27.275 --> 41:30.482
OR WILL HE END UP WITH
A SUPERPOWERED ORANGE CRATE?

41:30.482 --> 41:32.275
WE GOT A PROBLEM.

41:32.275 --> 41:33.379
THAT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.
