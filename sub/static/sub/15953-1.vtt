00:12.503 --> 00:14.603
(yelling)

00:19.076 --> 00:21.043
- [Inmate] Resistance
to what (bleep).

00:21.178 --> 00:22.911
You're a problem here!

00:26.717 --> 00:28.917
(wailing)

00:36.593 --> 00:38.026
(indistinct chatter)

00:38.128 --> 00:40.328
(laughing)

01:00.084 --> 01:01.950
- It's okay, it's okay.

01:03.353 --> 01:05.887
- I don't know
what to do.

01:10.627 --> 01:12.727
(crying)

01:19.103 --> 01:19.935
- Sorry.

01:23.140 --> 01:26.274
(electronic humming)

01:26.410 --> 01:29.010
(drums beating)

01:30.881 --> 01:32.414
- [Sheriff] This is
the Clark County Jail.

01:32.516 --> 01:36.051
- [Officer] On the
ground, on the ground!

01:37.821 --> 01:40.856
- The facility houses
approximately 500 inmates,

01:40.958 --> 01:42.724
with both men and
women with crimes

01:42.860 --> 01:44.826
ranging from
misdemeanor to murder.

01:44.928 --> 01:46.528
- [Officer] Slowly, slowly.

01:46.630 --> 01:48.330
- Please, please.

01:48.432 --> 01:49.931
- [Officer] Bring
your hands forward.

01:50.033 --> 01:51.633
- Before I took office,
I think the inmates

01:51.735 --> 01:54.069
for the most part were
running the facility.

01:54.171 --> 01:57.038
The drugs were just absolutely
rampant in the jail.

01:57.174 --> 02:01.076
Drastic change needed to
take place immediately.

02:05.682 --> 02:07.883
Their mission was to
be an undercover inmate

02:07.985 --> 02:11.786
and help root out
crime and corruption.

02:11.922 --> 02:13.488
At the conclusion of
the program, we gained

02:13.590 --> 02:15.857
a lot of valuable information.

02:15.959 --> 02:18.059
- I do know that,
almost every cell,

02:18.195 --> 02:19.861
they figured out how to get
those light fixtures open

02:19.963 --> 02:21.396
and they're hiding stuff
in the light fixtures.

02:21.498 --> 02:25.400
- Your trustees are really
destroying your place for you.

02:25.502 --> 02:27.502
Stuff is getting smuggled
out under the trays.

02:27.604 --> 02:29.471
- Upstairs is the
trouble makers.

02:29.573 --> 02:31.373
They cause a raucous,
they yell, they scream,

02:31.475 --> 02:33.341
they run from cell to cell.

02:33.477 --> 02:34.543
- [sheriff] Based
on that information,

02:34.645 --> 02:36.578
we started re-training
corrections officers to check

02:36.680 --> 02:38.680
the food trays for contraband.

02:38.782 --> 02:40.749
We increased shake downs
and made them more efficient

02:40.884 --> 02:42.751
in checking new hiding spots.

02:42.853 --> 02:44.286
- We learned a lot in phase one,

02:44.421 --> 02:46.087
but I definitely believe
there's still more to learn.

02:46.190 --> 02:47.589
Our hope for phase two would be

02:47.691 --> 02:49.457
to get more in-depth
information.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.059
There are still drugs
coming into the facility

02:51.161 --> 02:53.061
and we would like to find
out how they're gettin' in.

02:53.163 --> 02:54.696
- Phase one ended
about two weeks ago,

02:54.831 --> 02:56.631
and now we're
starting phase two.

02:56.733 --> 02:58.233
We have to do it so
quickly, 'cause we have

02:58.368 --> 03:01.503
to maintain the
secrecy of the program.

03:06.977 --> 03:10.045
- My motivation for
participating in it is

03:10.147 --> 03:11.313
to make change.

03:11.415 --> 03:13.515
- I think it would be good
to know what jail is like.

03:13.617 --> 03:15.116
This may be one of
the only opportunities

03:15.219 --> 03:16.585
I ever get to go to jail.

03:16.687 --> 03:19.187
- My daughter went to prison
when she was 18 years old.

03:19.289 --> 03:23.091
I would like to do it,
because it would make me feel

03:23.193 --> 03:25.393
a relief to know
what she goes through

03:25.495 --> 03:27.095
on a day-to-day basis. (crying)

03:27.231 --> 03:30.198
- I know that it would
make me a better attorney.

03:30.300 --> 03:33.368
- I have like 35 years of
experience in law enforcement.

03:33.470 --> 03:36.638
To look at the other
side of that system,

03:36.740 --> 03:38.707
it's very educational.

03:38.842 --> 03:41.009
- So I started
drinking when I was 10.

03:41.111 --> 03:44.112
I was very, very addicted
to drugs and alcohol.

03:44.248 --> 03:46.982
If I'm able to help one
person while I'm in there,

03:47.150 --> 03:48.049
that's everything.

03:48.151 --> 03:50.485
- It's not innocent
until proven guilty

03:50.554 --> 03:51.920
if you're puttin'
people in cuffs

03:52.055 --> 03:55.056
and throwin' 'em on the
ground, beatin' 'em around.

03:55.158 --> 03:57.459
- I wanna take away
the aspect of knowing

03:57.561 --> 04:00.562
from the other
side, what they see.

04:00.664 --> 04:04.199
(ominous electronic music)

04:12.376 --> 04:13.608
- Pleasure to meet you guys,

04:13.710 --> 04:15.277
been Sheriff around a year.

04:15.345 --> 04:17.312
To give you little bit of
an idea of where we're at,

04:17.414 --> 04:19.447
we're getting better,
but we're not quite

04:19.548 --> 04:21.315
where I wanna be at yet.

04:21.418 --> 04:24.119
You go into the facility,
basically be my eyes and ears.

04:24.221 --> 04:26.054
Just know that with
the exception of myself

04:26.156 --> 04:28.556
and Captain Scottie Maples,
and I think two other people,

04:28.659 --> 04:30.325
no one else is gonna know what

04:30.494 --> 04:33.395
your true reason
for being there is.

04:38.101 --> 04:39.367
- I'm Captain Scottie Maples.

04:39.469 --> 04:40.935
Some of the stuff
I'm gonna tell ya

04:41.038 --> 04:42.737
is just more technical,
what you need to do,

04:42.839 --> 04:44.906
and how do you stay safe.

04:50.247 --> 04:51.212
When you come in, you're gonna

04:51.315 --> 04:52.580
go through the booking process.

04:52.683 --> 04:54.482
Gonna fingerprint
ya, take your photo,

04:54.584 --> 04:56.718
you'll be sent up to
the classification pod.

04:56.853 --> 04:59.287
The classification pod is
where all new inmates go,

04:59.389 --> 05:00.955
but know these other
inmates are seasoned,

05:01.058 --> 05:02.457
they've been in
there for a while,

05:02.559 --> 05:04.092
so when you come
in as a new inmate,

05:04.194 --> 05:06.227
they'll be watchin'
everything that you do,

05:06.363 --> 05:08.296
and probably the less
you say, the better.

05:08.398 --> 05:10.031
- If you come into a
jail, it's best you stick

05:10.133 --> 05:11.666
to yourself and be a loner.

05:11.802 --> 05:13.034
- Be aware of your surroundings,

05:13.170 --> 05:14.536
and sometimes you just
can't help but (bleep),

05:14.638 --> 05:16.037
it just happens sometimes.

05:16.173 --> 05:17.072
(smacking)

05:17.207 --> 05:18.707
(groaning)
[beep]

05:18.842 --> 05:20.408
(smacking)
(bleeping)

05:20.510 --> 05:23.178
- Safety measures in the
prison, like, how is it?

05:23.313 --> 05:24.713
- If you need to defend
yourself, you need

05:24.848 --> 05:27.182
to defend yourself, you
know, you're not gonna be

05:27.284 --> 05:29.317
charged criminally for
defending yourself.

05:29.419 --> 05:31.219
But on the other aspect,
if you do commit a crime

05:31.355 --> 05:33.955
unprovoked, you will be charged.

05:35.158 --> 05:36.624
- When somebody come
at me, you know,

05:36.760 --> 05:39.094
I definitely don't have a
problem defending myself.

05:39.196 --> 05:41.996
Oooh oooh, make some
of that spaghetti.

05:42.099 --> 05:43.164
You heatin' it up for me?

05:43.266 --> 05:44.265
- [Grandmother] Yes.

05:44.334 --> 05:48.236
- I'm Dion, 24 years
old, I'm a criminologist.

05:48.338 --> 05:50.772
I'm from Detroit, Michigan.

05:50.874 --> 05:53.141
My mom and dad had me when
they was 17 years old,

05:53.243 --> 05:55.143
and it was kinda rough for 'em,

05:55.245 --> 05:57.379
so we actually stayed
with my grandma.

05:57.481 --> 06:00.348
- You know you
love my spaghetti.

06:00.484 --> 06:01.750
- That's why I stopped
by here, I was like,

06:01.852 --> 06:05.754
yeah I gotta come see my granny
and get me a little plate.

06:05.856 --> 06:08.823
Growing up, Detroit is
pretty tough, you have gangs.

06:08.925 --> 06:10.358
If you see a group
of guys of more

06:10.460 --> 06:12.394
than three to four
people, more than likely

06:12.496 --> 06:14.829
you're gonna get jumped, period.

06:14.931 --> 06:17.232
I lost a few family
members to getting killed.

06:17.334 --> 06:18.800
I had a cousin who was killed,

06:18.902 --> 06:20.835
right on the corner
of our block.

06:20.937 --> 06:23.037
We just found this new
apartment and everything.

06:23.173 --> 06:24.339
- [Grandmother]Has it
got two bedrooms or one?

06:24.474 --> 06:25.707
- One bedroom.

06:25.809 --> 06:28.243
- Whatch ya'll gonna do
when you have a fuss?

06:28.345 --> 06:30.645
You got to have
another room, okay?

06:30.747 --> 06:32.180
You got to have another room.

06:32.315 --> 06:33.281
When you get mad, what
you gonna sit there

06:33.417 --> 06:34.282
and look at each other?

06:34.384 --> 06:36.017
(laughing)

06:36.153 --> 06:37.852
- My point of view of the
criminal justice system

06:37.988 --> 06:40.121
is just, a lot of
the laws are biased.

06:40.257 --> 06:42.023
It's not toward the
race thing, it's more

06:42.125 --> 06:44.192
towards lower income people.

06:44.361 --> 06:47.896
And that's as a whole,
like, white, black, purple.

06:47.998 --> 06:50.031
My dad was incarcerated.

06:50.133 --> 06:52.801
He was falsely
accused of possession,

06:52.903 --> 06:55.136
but come to find out,
that he didn't do it

06:55.272 --> 06:58.173
and was let free, and
that's one of the reasons

06:58.275 --> 07:00.909
that I wanted to get my
masters in criminology

07:01.011 --> 07:02.644
and make my family proud.

07:02.779 --> 07:04.612
Just trying to stay
positive and think about

07:04.748 --> 07:07.248
everything else that's
going on, you know,

07:07.350 --> 07:11.085
that it's gonna be good
for us and stuff, so...

07:11.188 --> 07:12.954
I'm doing this program
because, I've been studying

07:13.089 --> 07:14.856
criminal justice for
the last six years,

07:14.958 --> 07:18.560
so I can get an unbiased opinion
of the corrections system.

07:18.662 --> 07:21.429
I can learn so much more, I'm
seeing everything first-hand

07:21.531 --> 07:23.031
that I seen in my textbook.

07:23.166 --> 07:25.366
- You're gonna be
gone for a long time.

07:25.469 --> 07:26.501
What's gonna happen in there?

07:26.603 --> 07:28.002
Do you even know
how it's gonna be?

07:28.104 --> 07:29.938
- Yeah, I hear a lot of
bad stuff about jail,

07:30.073 --> 07:32.941
about don't drop the soap
or anything like that but,

07:33.076 --> 07:34.676
nah, I'm not too
worried about it.

07:34.744 --> 07:36.177
It's the same people I prayed

07:36.313 --> 07:38.513
and grew up with over the years.

07:38.615 --> 07:42.584
- I just hope that you
safe in there, and temper.

07:42.686 --> 07:43.518
- I know.

07:44.988 --> 07:47.188
(laughing)

07:48.058 --> 07:50.124
- When you're in there,
don't ask too many questions,

07:50.260 --> 07:51.192
don't be a reporter.

07:51.261 --> 07:53.261
Nobody walks into
the jail, sits down,

07:53.396 --> 07:55.029
and starts asking other
inmates questions.

07:55.165 --> 07:56.397
They're gonna say,
"Are you a cop?

07:56.500 --> 07:57.499
"You a snitch?"

07:57.601 --> 07:58.867
- We don't like snitches.

07:58.969 --> 08:00.335
- Being a snitch,
you'll never be able

08:00.470 --> 08:02.470
to live comfortable,
no matter where you go.

08:02.572 --> 08:04.339
- You're asking us to do
a lotta snitching here,

08:04.441 --> 08:06.207
which I'm firmly prepared to do,

08:06.309 --> 08:08.510
but, what's the
repercussions of that?

08:08.612 --> 08:09.911
- I don't want you to
go question inmates

08:10.046 --> 08:12.647
about anything, to draw any
type of attention to yourself.

08:12.749 --> 08:14.215
Basically, you just
be a good witness

08:14.317 --> 08:16.784
and a good listener,
especially with you,

08:16.887 --> 08:18.586
with the experience
in law enforcement.

08:18.722 --> 08:20.221
Having that police
officer mentality,

08:20.323 --> 08:21.656
you'll know what to look for.

08:21.791 --> 08:23.091
If you see the staff
doing something

08:23.226 --> 08:25.593
that doesn't look right,
it probably isn't right.

08:25.729 --> 08:29.464
- They got dirty cops in
this city wide, watch 'em.

08:29.566 --> 08:31.566
- They treat us like
animals, for real.

08:31.701 --> 08:33.568
- I don't have any
respect for CO's,

08:33.669 --> 08:35.436
and basic law enforcement.

08:35.539 --> 08:38.172
I don't even have any respect
for the judicial system,

08:38.275 --> 08:40.975
because it's severely broken.

08:41.111 --> 08:44.646
I'm Monalisa, and
I live in New York.

08:44.748 --> 08:46.681
I need to know the truth
about incarceration,

08:46.783 --> 08:50.318
because my daughter is
currently incarcerated.

08:50.387 --> 08:52.253
She went in at the age of 18,

08:52.389 --> 08:55.957
and has been serving for about,
a little over three years.

08:56.092 --> 08:59.160
Sierra was arrested
for armed robbery.

09:00.263 --> 09:02.163
She was severely
addicted to drugs,

09:02.299 --> 09:05.800
and she was doing what she had
to do to feed that addiction.

09:05.936 --> 09:09.103
Sierra was given 10 years,
a mandatory minimum.

09:09.205 --> 09:12.707
When I heard, my heart
fell to the ground.

09:12.842 --> 09:15.009
She's a caged animal now.

09:15.145 --> 09:19.247
I kind of don't even think
of her, as still being human.

09:25.956 --> 09:28.990
I'm sorry. (crying).

09:31.261 --> 09:34.262
You would think after three
years, I'd be over this,

09:34.364 --> 09:37.899
but it seems like, it
doesn't ever go away.

09:39.669 --> 09:40.435
- [Husband] You okay?

09:40.537 --> 09:41.402
- Yep.

09:41.504 --> 09:43.004
- Alright, hang on
for just a second

09:43.106 --> 09:45.773
while we finish getting set
up, and thanks for calling.

09:45.875 --> 09:47.275
- Let's roll.

09:47.410 --> 09:48.843
I started an organization
called Parents

09:48.945 --> 09:50.745
with Incarcerated
Children, that I created

09:50.880 --> 09:53.014
strictly out of my pain,
because I was too embarrassed

09:53.149 --> 09:55.249
to really talk to people about
what I was going through.

09:55.352 --> 09:57.919
As you know, it's no secret
that I have a daughter

09:58.021 --> 09:59.287
that is incarcerated.

09:59.389 --> 10:03.758
I've agreed to go to jail,
because I am so broken,

10:03.927 --> 10:06.160
emotionally, from
losing my daughter.

10:06.262 --> 10:08.429
At first, my husband was
completely against this.

10:08.531 --> 10:10.865
We would literally
argue about it,

10:11.001 --> 10:13.501
but when he started to
hear the sheriff's concept,

10:13.637 --> 10:15.870
and how it connected
to me becoming

10:15.972 --> 10:19.007
more of a voice
for prison reform,

10:19.109 --> 10:20.942
that's when he started
to somewhat agree.

10:21.077 --> 10:23.578
A lot of us don't
understand or have any idea

10:23.680 --> 10:26.080
what it's like to
be incarcerated.

10:26.182 --> 10:28.650
I wanna do this because
I wanna help her.

10:28.752 --> 10:31.719
I wanna help many
people alongside of her.

10:31.821 --> 10:33.888
Since my daughter's
been incarcerated,

10:34.024 --> 10:36.090
my point of view as far
as correctional officers,

10:36.192 --> 10:38.092
has changed greatly.

10:38.194 --> 10:39.694
They're abusing their power.

10:39.829 --> 10:41.229
I don't have any
respect for 'em.

10:41.331 --> 10:44.065
I actually wonder whether or not

10:44.200 --> 10:47.101
they're even doing
their jobs right.

10:47.237 --> 10:49.604
So, may I ask, once you get
all of this information,

10:49.706 --> 10:51.472
and you compile it,
what's the reality

10:51.574 --> 10:53.307
of true change coming about?

10:53.410 --> 10:54.809
- We'll take all
those suggestions.

10:54.944 --> 10:56.611
Is it something we need
to change in our policy

10:56.746 --> 10:58.379
and procedures, staffing change,

10:58.515 --> 10:59.947
and I plan on
implementing changes

11:00.050 --> 11:01.983
to make it better
and improve upon.

11:02.118 --> 11:03.217
- The concerns I
have about Monalisa

11:03.319 --> 11:05.353
is her dislike for
law enforcement.

11:05.455 --> 11:07.922
I really think that
could, really affect

11:08.024 --> 11:10.458
her participation
in this program.

11:10.560 --> 11:11.659
- How many fights do you have

11:11.761 --> 11:13.127
that are ending up in death?

11:13.229 --> 11:14.829
- I can't ever
remember any in death.

11:14.931 --> 11:18.266
Hospital visits,
that's just how it is.

11:18.368 --> 11:19.333
(smacking)

11:19.436 --> 11:20.301
- It's the animal
kingdom in here.

11:20.403 --> 11:22.136
Almost kill or be
killed, for real.

11:22.238 --> 11:24.439
(banging)

11:24.574 --> 11:26.507
And if you don't know, you
better learn real fast,

11:26.609 --> 11:28.710
or you ain't gonna survive.

11:28.812 --> 11:32.180
(objects clanging)

11:32.282 --> 11:35.316
(electronic humming)

11:37.120 --> 11:39.687
(ominous music)

11:41.291 --> 11:42.523
- You may see some
contraband in there,

11:42.625 --> 11:43.891
because this is the
first point of contact.

11:43.993 --> 11:46.427
The inmates come from
the street, to the jail,

11:46.563 --> 11:48.196
so if there's any
contraband, it usually gets

11:48.298 --> 11:51.065
smoked up or used up
in the classification.

11:51.201 --> 11:54.168
Any insight on how it gets up,
we would greatly appreciate.

11:54.270 --> 11:56.170
- There are more drugs
in the Clark County jail

11:56.272 --> 11:57.505
than there is on the streets.

11:57.640 --> 11:59.640
- Everybody's on drugs,
everybody's coming off something

11:59.776 --> 12:02.510
they might lie and say
they're not, but they are.

12:02.612 --> 12:06.414
- I feel like, the less
drugs or alcohol I see,

12:06.549 --> 12:08.549
would be better for me.

12:08.651 --> 12:11.252
My name is Ashleigh,
I'm 27 years old,

12:11.387 --> 12:13.254
and I live in Tennessee.

12:13.356 --> 12:15.156
Gonna change his diaper.

12:15.258 --> 12:17.725
I have a three month
old son named Ryker,

12:17.861 --> 12:20.128
and I'm married to Zac,
and he has actually

12:20.230 --> 12:23.097
been through the
Sheriff's program.

12:23.233 --> 12:26.300
Zac is finally home, so
now I have to help him

12:26.402 --> 12:28.536
get into the swing of
things, with the baby,

12:28.638 --> 12:31.072
and show him our routine.

12:31.174 --> 12:32.840
You wanna clean out his ears?

12:32.942 --> 12:34.108
- Sure.

12:35.011 --> 12:38.980
- I started drinking and doing
drugs at a very young age.

12:40.650 --> 12:42.984
I did have multiple
run-ins with the law,

12:43.119 --> 12:44.719
all alcohol related.

12:44.854 --> 12:47.021
My alcoholism became
life or death.

12:47.123 --> 12:50.691
I ended up overdosing
on alcohol and cocaine.

12:51.861 --> 12:54.162
There was a doctor
who was blunt.

12:54.297 --> 12:55.797
He said, "There's
a 50 percent chance

12:55.899 --> 12:58.399
"they will roll you out
of here in a body bag."

12:58.535 --> 13:00.868
Grab the little hair
brush down there.

13:00.970 --> 13:03.771
My biological mother
drank herself to death

13:03.907 --> 13:05.573
when she was 38 years old.

13:05.708 --> 13:07.775
She was never a mother to me.

13:07.911 --> 13:09.610
She gave me up when
I was six months old,

13:09.679 --> 13:12.280
and I knew at that point,
if I did not change,

13:12.382 --> 13:14.782
that was going to be my reality.

13:14.918 --> 13:18.519
I have been sober four
years, it feels amazing.

13:18.621 --> 13:20.021
- My biggest thing is,
something's gonna happen

13:20.156 --> 13:24.225
that I haven't planned for,
or haven't experienced,

13:25.495 --> 13:28.496
and that's what
I'm nervous about.

13:28.631 --> 13:32.333
- When I was first approached
about being in the program,

13:32.435 --> 13:35.736
I was actually in the
jail to visit Zac.

13:37.040 --> 13:39.540
- Baby.

13:39.642 --> 13:41.442
Having her come up
here and surprise me

13:41.544 --> 13:43.110
was absolutely amazing.

13:43.213 --> 13:45.680
- And meeting with the sheriff.

13:46.516 --> 13:48.683
- I appreciate the
sacrifice you're making

13:48.818 --> 13:50.218
to make this program work.

13:50.320 --> 13:52.486
So million dollar question,
if roles were reversed,

13:52.589 --> 13:53.688
could you do it, do you think?

13:53.790 --> 13:57.625
- I think I could probably
suck it up and do it.

14:00.163 --> 14:03.364
Very nice to meet
you, thank you, bye.

14:05.201 --> 14:08.870
My only hope is that I can
have some sort of an impact

14:08.972 --> 14:11.639
on the women in
the jail with me.

14:12.909 --> 14:16.677
- I'm not afraid for your
safety or his safety,

14:18.114 --> 14:19.647
more than anything
I just don't like

14:19.749 --> 14:21.649
causing you this stress.

14:22.652 --> 14:24.752
Ashleigh has made a complete 180

14:24.854 --> 14:26.687
from the way her life
was going before.

14:26.823 --> 14:28.222
This gives her an
opportunity to see,

14:28.291 --> 14:29.957
this is probably where
I would have ended up

14:30.093 --> 14:32.793
if I hadn't turned
my life around.

14:33.663 --> 14:35.796
- As much as Zac
has kind of told me

14:35.899 --> 14:38.232
how his experience was,
it's completely different.

14:38.301 --> 14:39.967
You put a room full
of men together,

14:40.069 --> 14:42.603
and a room full of women
who are in trouble,

14:42.705 --> 14:44.939
you are going to have two
totally different situations.

14:45.041 --> 14:46.407
It scares me that I don't know

14:46.542 --> 14:49.277
what to expect until I'm there.

14:49.412 --> 14:52.747
- When you come in, no
makeup, or if you do,

14:52.815 --> 14:55.383
mess it up, because
you need to look rough,

14:55.485 --> 14:56.217
- [Ashleigh] I will.

14:56.319 --> 14:57.151
- When you go upstairs.

14:57.220 --> 14:58.085
- There are some
concerns with Ashleigh

14:58.187 --> 14:59.120
making it through the program.

14:59.222 --> 15:00.588
She has a small child at home,

15:00.723 --> 15:03.291
Zac just got out of the
program and came home,

15:03.359 --> 15:05.593
so there was a very small
amount of time between there.

15:05.728 --> 15:07.194
Ashleigh doesn't look
like your typical inmate.

15:07.297 --> 15:11.065
She may stick out, it could
lead to trouble for her.

15:11.200 --> 15:13.401
- There's one main guy
in there, the pod boss.

15:13.503 --> 15:15.002
He's established,
he's been to prison,

15:15.104 --> 15:17.104
he's been around the
jail for a while,

15:17.206 --> 15:18.739
or she's been around
the jail for a while.

15:18.808 --> 15:20.474
He wants to know
what you're about.

15:20.576 --> 15:22.777
- What's the
propensity for gangs

15:22.912 --> 15:24.912
and racial segregation
and what not here?

15:25.048 --> 15:26.113
Things I need to be uh--

15:26.215 --> 15:27.815
- You gotta crane
this language down.

15:27.917 --> 15:29.817
"Propensity for
racial segregation"?

15:29.919 --> 15:31.018
- Uh, what's the--

15:31.054 --> 15:32.353
- (laughing) You're gonna
have a rough time, man,

15:32.488 --> 15:33.454
a rough time.

15:33.556 --> 15:34.889
- Is this a thing I'm
gonna have to keep up,

15:34.991 --> 15:37.758
basically just talk,
uh, monosyllabically?

15:37.860 --> 15:39.760
'Cause I don't wanna come
off as condescending either.

15:39.896 --> 15:42.863
- Yeah, and it will come
off as condescending.

15:42.966 --> 15:44.632
- I have no problem
actually pulling through

15:44.767 --> 15:47.068
any of this in terms
of just being in jail,

15:47.170 --> 15:49.036
I mean, there are
people weaker than me,

15:49.138 --> 15:52.473
mentally and physically,
less intelligent than me,

15:52.575 --> 15:55.042
who've made it, and
I'll prevail as well.

15:55.144 --> 15:58.612
My name's Ryan, I'm
27, I'm from Kentucky.

15:58.715 --> 16:00.314
A lot of people
don't realize that,

16:00.450 --> 16:04.285
when you're in jail, it's not
just that you can't leave.

16:04.420 --> 16:05.653
It's that they really
take away a lot

16:05.755 --> 16:08.622
of the rights that you have.

16:08.725 --> 16:10.725
So freedom, it's
very important to me.

16:10.827 --> 16:13.761
I like rights, I like freedom.

16:13.863 --> 16:16.297
I joined the US Army Reserves,

16:16.432 --> 16:19.233
I was 19 years old and I
worked as code team medic

16:19.335 --> 16:22.737
in King's Daughters Intensive
Care just shy of three years.

16:22.872 --> 16:25.873
I'm currently applying
to be a police officer.

16:25.975 --> 16:27.074
Lotta stuff going on.

16:27.176 --> 16:28.442
- [Mother] Yeah, how
you doing bud?

16:28.578 --> 16:30.678
- I'm doing good,
everything's fine.

16:30.780 --> 16:31.846
- Your hair is really long.

16:31.948 --> 16:33.981
- I know, I didn't
wanna get a hair cut.

16:34.117 --> 16:36.751
My ultimate goal is to
become a homicide detective,

16:36.886 --> 16:39.487
and I feel that this
project definitely gives me

16:39.622 --> 16:41.422
the insight that I need
to be more comfortable

16:41.557 --> 16:44.025
doing what I have to
do for those jobs.

16:44.160 --> 16:45.426
Knowledge is important to me.

16:45.495 --> 16:48.229
I wanna bring to light
all of the actual problems

16:48.331 --> 16:50.364
with the criminal
justice system,

16:50.466 --> 16:51.899
and actually fix them.

16:52.035 --> 16:53.868
- It starts with one
person, to make a change,

16:54.003 --> 16:57.972
but seriously, in
something that is so big

16:58.107 --> 17:03.944
and major and, risking
your life, seriously.

17:04.079 --> 17:06.146
- Potentially I could make
those people's lives better

17:06.249 --> 17:08.015
or even expedite the process

17:08.151 --> 17:10.017
of them getting out
sooner or whatever.

17:10.153 --> 17:11.285
A lot of people say,
"Ah, they're criminals,

17:11.387 --> 17:12.853
"lock 'em away,
throw away the key."

17:12.954 --> 17:15.222
I can't just sit aside
and baselessly judge

17:15.324 --> 17:17.191
or assume things about
an entire population

17:17.326 --> 17:19.292
of people that I've never met.

17:19.462 --> 17:22.029
- I just have too many things
just bombarding in my mind,

17:22.165 --> 17:24.665
I'm just all over the
board, so to speak.

17:24.767 --> 17:26.233
- I'm not worried about jail.

17:26.301 --> 17:29.070
Day one, I'm obviously
gonna be fresh-faced,

17:29.138 --> 17:31.806
but I'm trying to scruff up,
and blend in a little bit.

17:31.908 --> 17:33.340
Apparently everybody
there's scruffy.

17:33.443 --> 17:37.178
I guess it's a lack of
willpower and hygiene.

17:39.115 --> 17:41.982
What makes a person a
classic target here?

17:42.085 --> 17:42.950
- Talking too much.

17:43.052 --> 17:44.251
- Alright.

17:44.320 --> 17:47.221
- Asking too many questions,
drawing attention to yourself.

17:47.323 --> 17:48.989
I could see Ryan having
problems with the other inmates,

17:49.125 --> 17:51.225
by coming off condescending
and maybe arrogant.

17:51.327 --> 17:53.094
That won't go well in jail.

17:53.196 --> 17:54.995
He's also small, so
he could be a target.

17:55.131 --> 17:57.965
(loud drum beating)

18:00.236 --> 18:03.204
(electronic humming)

18:04.440 --> 18:07.308
- So while you're in jail,
some of just the inmate code.

18:07.410 --> 18:10.611
Gambling, playing cards
or bettin' on sports,

18:10.713 --> 18:13.848
or anything like this, now
it's a jail rule violation,

18:13.916 --> 18:15.883
but, it still happens,
and they're gonna bait ya.

18:16.018 --> 18:17.118
They're gonna ask you, "You
wanna get in on this game?"

18:17.220 --> 18:17.985
"Well I don't got no food."

18:18.087 --> 18:18.919
"Well I'll front ya two."

18:19.021 --> 18:20.821
- [Inmate] I
just wanna get rich.

18:20.923 --> 18:22.723
- They have my money!

18:23.659 --> 18:24.492
- Pardon my language here,

18:24.527 --> 18:26.327
but you never use
the word, bitch.

18:26.429 --> 18:30.097
That is a word you do
not say in jail, period.

18:32.869 --> 18:35.002
(smacking)

18:35.905 --> 18:37.838
- The B-word is a
big no-no in jail.

18:37.974 --> 18:42.176
You never say bitch, in
jail, or you are gonna fight.

18:42.278 --> 18:43.611
- If you see inmates puttin'
their tennis shoes on,

18:43.713 --> 18:45.813
and a bunch of 'em,
then somethin's

18:45.915 --> 18:47.114
gettin' ready to pop off.

18:47.216 --> 18:48.983
- What is the significance
of lacing the shoes,

18:49.085 --> 18:50.184
what are they preparing to do?

18:50.286 --> 18:51.552
- They have socks on,
or the shower shoes,

18:51.687 --> 18:54.288
which are sandals, and nobody
fights in socks or sandals,

18:54.390 --> 18:55.823
because you're
gonna trip and fall.

18:55.958 --> 18:57.158
You'll see 10 guys
lace up their shoes

18:57.293 --> 18:59.560
because two people
are gonna fight.

18:59.629 --> 19:01.362
- I don't think anyone
could possibly look at this

19:01.497 --> 19:04.265
and not think that there's
some craziness to it.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.100
I have no idea what
I'm getting into,

19:06.235 --> 19:08.802
in terms of what it's
actually like to be an inmate.

19:08.905 --> 19:10.471
Well, will you
write me every day?

19:10.606 --> 19:12.339
(laughing)

19:12.441 --> 19:14.608
My name is Brian,
I'm 39 years old,

19:14.677 --> 19:17.578
and I'm an attorney for
the California Department

19:17.680 --> 19:19.747
of Corrections and
Rehabilitation.

19:19.882 --> 19:20.948
Well, when was the
last time we spent

19:21.050 --> 19:23.450
more than a week
apart from each other?

19:23.586 --> 19:26.921
- I don't know, it's gotta
be at least a decade.

19:27.023 --> 19:29.890
- I'm married to my wife,
Janie, and we have two children.

19:29.992 --> 19:31.926
I have a seven year
old son named Joseph,

19:31.994 --> 19:34.562
and a toddler named Micah.

19:34.697 --> 19:36.430
We're gonna curl some
Joe, okay, ready?

19:36.532 --> 19:39.833
Up, ready, cheese. (laughing)

19:39.936 --> 19:41.869
I love them all so
dearly, I'm so lucky

19:42.004 --> 19:43.470
to have them in my life.

19:43.573 --> 19:46.307
Uh, uh.
(giggling)

19:46.409 --> 19:48.108
As an attorney for the
Department of Corrections

19:48.211 --> 19:51.111
and Rehabilitation,
my job is to go after

19:51.247 --> 19:53.948
the corrections officers
in my department

19:54.050 --> 19:55.816
who commit job-related
misconduct.

19:55.918 --> 19:58.586
So, I don't have a
good feel for how well

19:58.688 --> 20:01.222
corrections officers
typically do their job.

20:01.324 --> 20:02.489
Would you like a
horsey-back ride?

20:02.625 --> 20:03.324
- Yeah.

20:03.426 --> 20:04.425
- Okay, hop on.

20:04.527 --> 20:06.594
Going into this, I
wanna test these CO's,

20:06.696 --> 20:09.029
because I wanna see, how
well do they actually

20:09.165 --> 20:12.933
hold up, when they
think nobody's looking?

20:13.035 --> 20:14.168
I'll be able to see
whether or not the inmates

20:14.270 --> 20:16.270
that we go to for
information are just

20:16.372 --> 20:19.139
always liars, or sometimes
they're telling the truth.

20:19.242 --> 20:22.509
Here. (growling)

20:22.645 --> 20:24.411
I'm coming into this
new environment.

20:24.513 --> 20:27.615
I have grown this beard
out in my pathetic attempt

20:27.717 --> 20:30.050
to try to look rough
around the edges.

20:30.152 --> 20:32.353
I don't know that I'm gonna
be able to pull it off.

20:32.455 --> 20:34.355
(drum beating)

20:34.457 --> 20:36.123
Are you nervous for us?

20:36.225 --> 20:38.559
- I would never go
to jail, I'm a cop.

20:38.661 --> 20:40.628
If I worry about
Brian in any aspect,

20:40.730 --> 20:43.063
it's maybe how he
handles himself in jail.

20:43.165 --> 20:44.832
He doesn't really
look like a criminal,

20:45.001 --> 20:47.601
and he's highly intelligent,
he's an attorney.

20:47.737 --> 20:49.970
- As far as anything we do
here, are you wanting us

20:50.106 --> 20:52.706
to hit you up when
we hear it, or...

20:52.775 --> 20:55.576
- You know, in the unlikely
event that you overhear

20:55.678 --> 20:58.445
a planned shank or
some type of uprising,

20:58.547 --> 21:01.382
that would be the time
when you would let us know

21:01.517 --> 21:02.249
as soon as possible.

21:02.318 --> 21:03.384
- [Brian] That
would be the time.

21:03.419 --> 21:04.485
- We don't want somebody
gettin' stabbed or hurt.

21:04.587 --> 21:05.786
I don't wanna take any chances.

21:05.888 --> 21:07.187
Towards the end of the
program, when you're done,

21:07.290 --> 21:09.556
we'll sit down for a
good while and debrief.

21:09.692 --> 21:10.958
- Okay.

21:11.060 --> 21:12.760
I grew up on a farm.

21:12.895 --> 21:16.563
It's very quiet where I
come from, very peaceful.

21:16.666 --> 21:18.966
My name's Chris, and
I live in Georgia.

21:19.101 --> 21:20.701
I've never had any
trouble with the law,

21:20.836 --> 21:23.937
besides like speeding
tickets and a parking ticket.

21:24.073 --> 21:25.105
The reason I've never been

21:25.207 --> 21:26.540
to jail is 'cause
I'm terrified of it.

21:26.642 --> 21:28.542
You hear all these horrible
stories growin' up,

21:28.678 --> 21:31.378
and then, that's where
criminals and low-lifes belong.

21:31.480 --> 21:32.780
- How you been, man?

21:32.915 --> 21:34.315
- But, my brother Ryan, ended up

21:34.450 --> 21:37.685
spending about four
months in jail.

21:37.820 --> 21:40.387
Me and my brother, we've
seen a lot together,

21:40.489 --> 21:42.289
but after Ryan got outta jail,

21:42.425 --> 21:45.359
we didn't communicate like
we did before he went in.

21:45.428 --> 21:47.194
He was a complete stranger.

21:47.330 --> 21:48.262
- You wanna beer?

21:48.364 --> 21:49.129
- Sure.

21:49.231 --> 21:51.332
Everything fell apart for him.

21:51.400 --> 21:54.168
He went homeless,
every bad decision

21:54.270 --> 21:57.338
I feel like I could sit
here and think of, he did.

21:57.506 --> 21:59.206
But I've been like, kinda
trying to wrap my head

21:59.342 --> 22:01.175
on what's the environment
gonna be like.

22:01.310 --> 22:03.143
- If they talk to
you, talk to them,

22:03.245 --> 22:05.412
but other than that,
that's what I did,

22:05.548 --> 22:07.114
I didn't really mess with
nobody when I was in there.

22:07.183 --> 22:09.550
- Probably the biggest thing I
wanna get out of this program

22:09.652 --> 22:11.919
is seeing things from
Ryan's perspective,

22:12.054 --> 22:16.123
and kinda understanding
why, not only we fell apart,

22:16.258 --> 22:20.194
but kinda why he can't
seem to move on from it.

22:20.329 --> 22:22.596
I wanna get into his
shoes, and figure out a way

22:22.732 --> 22:25.833
to be able to talk
to him about it.

22:25.935 --> 22:27.668
- Basically, the rules
that you wanna make sure

22:27.770 --> 22:29.269
you don't break, if
you know it's illegal

22:29.372 --> 22:30.904
out in the real world,
then it's gonna be

22:31.040 --> 22:32.206
illegal in the
Clark County Jail.

22:32.308 --> 22:35.008
Naturally, don't do drugs,

22:35.177 --> 22:37.778
don't mess with cameras,
that's a big major no-no.

22:37.913 --> 22:39.613
If God forbid somethin'
ever happened where

22:39.749 --> 22:41.215
you felt like you had
to defend yourself,

22:41.317 --> 22:43.817
the rule of my opinion
is, don't start a fight.

22:43.953 --> 22:45.486
- It's dangerous
to fight in there.

22:45.588 --> 22:46.420
- I got stabbed.

22:46.522 --> 22:48.555
- I've had my jaw broke.

22:48.657 --> 22:50.290
- I've seen guys, and
look down and see blood

22:50.393 --> 22:54.395
in their oatmeal 'cause
their neck just got cut.

22:56.031 --> 22:57.965
- To me, that's life or death.

22:58.067 --> 23:00.801
(smacking)
(objects crashing)

23:02.805 --> 23:06.273
(electronic humming)

23:06.375 --> 23:08.075
- When you go in,
there's a day room,

23:08.177 --> 23:11.645
there's the stairs that go up,
and there's cells and cells.

23:11.747 --> 23:14.047
Try to, at all costs,
get a bottom cell.

23:14.116 --> 23:16.083
We've got a lot better
coverage on you.

23:16.185 --> 23:18.118
- What would be your
advice if, I'm in there,

23:18.254 --> 23:20.354
I'm an inmate, I
better stand my ground.

23:20.489 --> 23:22.189
What do you want
from your side of us,

23:22.258 --> 23:24.491
'cause we'd have to be like,
"You want some of this?"

23:24.627 --> 23:27.094
Because if I don't, I'm
gonna get my ass kicked.

23:27.196 --> 23:28.662
- If it gets bad and
you think, "I've gotta

23:28.764 --> 23:29.930
"actually fight somebody,"
I ain't catchin'

23:30.032 --> 23:31.131
no new charges for you.

23:31.267 --> 23:32.933
- I've seen everything.

23:33.002 --> 23:36.136
I've seen the shanks, I've
seen the hooch being made.

23:36.205 --> 23:39.206
I'm a CO, I've been in more
fights than I can count.

23:39.308 --> 23:42.309
Yeah, go get sissies.

23:42.478 --> 23:45.212
I'm Sheri, I'm 39, I'm
from the northwest.

23:45.314 --> 23:46.013
- Hi, mom!

23:46.148 --> 23:47.314
- Hi, buddy.

23:47.416 --> 23:48.415
Whaddya get, any good?

23:48.551 --> 23:50.284
I'm a mom of three.

23:50.419 --> 23:54.655
You know, daddy's gonna make
dinner tonight, taco Tuesday.

23:54.757 --> 23:56.590
And I'm trying to go
back into my career.

23:56.692 --> 24:00.561
I was a corrections officer
in a maximum prison.

24:00.696 --> 24:03.530
It was the most amazing
job I've ever had.

24:03.566 --> 24:07.701
Being a corrections officer
was a perfect fit for me,

24:07.837 --> 24:10.604
and I had to step away from
it when Dustin got deployed,

24:10.706 --> 24:13.440
to Afghanistan for
almost 13 months.

24:13.576 --> 24:15.609
So I went from
working full time,

24:15.711 --> 24:17.978
to being a stay-at-home mom.

24:18.147 --> 24:20.347
Now, my husband's
back from Afghanistan,

24:20.449 --> 24:22.783
and I'm ready to go
back to work, it's time.

24:22.885 --> 24:24.084
It's my time now.

24:24.186 --> 24:26.420
I'm gonna come back
like 40 pounds heavier

24:26.522 --> 24:28.489
with three little honey
buns, I'll be like,

24:28.591 --> 24:29.690
"They're my precious."

24:29.792 --> 24:31.992
- You'll know how to make
prison birthday cake.

24:32.094 --> 24:33.293
- I already know how
to make prison cake.

24:33.362 --> 24:34.995
- Yeah, I figured
you probably did.

24:35.097 --> 24:36.630
- Really, no corrections
officer is ever

24:36.732 --> 24:37.998
gonna get to do this.

24:38.100 --> 24:39.533
Of course, no one's
ever really ready.

24:39.635 --> 24:41.735
Nobody wants to go
to jail. (laughs)

24:41.871 --> 24:46.240
But at the same aspect, this
opportunity is so amazing.

24:46.375 --> 24:47.541
To learn something,
and hopefully

24:47.643 --> 24:49.510
to make some great changes.

24:49.612 --> 24:51.378
(suspenseful music)

24:51.514 --> 24:53.146
- If you feel for
your safety, you know,

24:53.249 --> 24:55.482
it's jail, you're
gonna have a decision

24:55.551 --> 24:57.251
every second of
every day, of whether

24:57.353 --> 24:58.652
you wanna stay there or not.

24:58.821 --> 25:00.554
That's up to you,
that's not up to me.

25:00.656 --> 25:01.922
- Well you could
take my three kids.

25:02.024 --> 25:03.757
We'll see how you feel at
the end, you might want to.

25:03.826 --> 25:05.392
- I can understand that too.

25:05.528 --> 25:07.528
Sheri's a former officer,
so that helps her,

25:07.630 --> 25:09.463
she knows the lingo, she
knows how inmates act,

25:09.565 --> 25:10.831
she knows about inmate behavior.

25:10.933 --> 25:12.266
That'll definitely
be a benefit to her.

25:14.136 --> 25:15.335
- How many staff have you got?

25:15.404 --> 25:17.838
- Oh you're lookin' about
eight, eight, nine per shift.

25:17.940 --> 25:19.006
- Yeah, that sounds very scary.

25:19.108 --> 25:20.407
- But, in my
experience in the jail,

25:20.476 --> 25:21.842
when there's a fight,
as soon as the officer

25:21.944 --> 25:23.644
makes it into the
section, it's over.

25:23.746 --> 25:25.279
- It's over, right.

25:25.381 --> 25:29.383
- I've arrested probably about
1,000 people in my career.

25:31.320 --> 25:32.586
It's a long career.

25:32.655 --> 25:33.787
(gun clicking)

25:33.856 --> 25:36.590
My name is Quintin, I'm a
retired state policeman,

25:36.692 --> 25:39.026
private investigator,
and bounty hunter.

25:39.128 --> 25:41.228
(keyboard music)

25:41.330 --> 25:43.463
I just like the way it sounds.

25:43.566 --> 25:47.501
I have three daughters, and I'm
in the process of a divorce.

25:50.472 --> 25:52.406
It's extremely important
for me to do this,

25:52.508 --> 25:54.841
because I am curious
to learn what it's like

25:54.944 --> 25:57.611
for all the people that I
brought into the system.

26:01.150 --> 26:02.683
What they don't agree with is,

26:02.785 --> 26:06.954
the how, the who, and
are we doing it fairly.

26:07.089 --> 26:08.989
I have no idea what it's
gonna be like for me,

26:09.124 --> 26:12.626
coming in as someone
formerly in law enforcement.

26:12.728 --> 26:15.963
We'll find out over
the next two months.

26:18.133 --> 26:20.734
I'm not scared, nervous,
or worried at all.

26:20.803 --> 26:22.269
(dramatic music)

26:22.371 --> 26:25.339
- I wanna go over
your cover stories.

26:29.144 --> 26:30.377
Your cover story, what is it?

26:30.446 --> 26:32.713
- We got pulled over and
a cop ran our license,

26:32.815 --> 26:34.514
and, they found some
stuff in the car.

26:34.617 --> 26:36.650
- The cop wouldn't of
found anything in the car,

26:36.719 --> 26:38.885
only thing they found was
that you had a warrant.

26:38.988 --> 26:40.921
Now, your crime
happened in New York.

26:41.023 --> 26:42.289
It's imperative for participants

26:42.391 --> 26:43.724
to know their cover stories,

26:43.892 --> 26:45.559
not only for the
inmates, for the staff.

26:45.661 --> 26:46.994
Our staff's been
around a long time.

26:47.096 --> 26:48.428
If a story doesn't
make sense to them,

26:48.530 --> 26:50.063
they're gonna start
asking questions too.

26:50.165 --> 26:52.032
What was the original crime
that got you the warrant?

26:52.101 --> 26:53.900
- Drugs, and a gun.

26:54.003 --> 26:56.370
- I have been arrested
for my third DUI,

26:56.472 --> 26:58.205
second in the state of Indiana.

26:58.307 --> 26:59.640
Woke up in the drunk tank.

26:59.742 --> 27:01.541
- It was a burglary
charge, failure to check in

27:01.644 --> 27:04.544
with my PO, resulting
in a warrant.

27:04.680 --> 27:07.714
- I was pulled over
by officer so-and-so.

27:07.750 --> 27:09.282
- So-and-so ain't
pullin' nobody over, man.

27:09.385 --> 27:11.018
This is serious.

27:11.120 --> 27:12.452
What was your scam,
how were you doing it?

27:12.554 --> 27:13.854
- Well, I can wash checks,

27:13.956 --> 27:15.622
so basically I was just
gonna, forge some signatures,

27:15.758 --> 27:16.957
and cash some
checks, and I thought

27:17.092 --> 27:18.225
it was gonna be
an innocent thing.

27:18.360 --> 27:20.027
- You seem pretty intelligent,
most inmates aren't.

27:20.129 --> 27:22.396
You've gotta tone it down.

27:22.464 --> 27:26.466
- I got pulled over
for speeding on I-65.

27:26.602 --> 27:28.969
It popped up a warrant
that I had back in Michigan

27:29.104 --> 27:30.837
for my armed robbery that I did.

27:30.973 --> 27:32.305
- Don't give 'em
the whole run down.

27:32.408 --> 27:34.107
If they need more information,
they're gonna ask ya.

27:34.243 --> 27:35.275
If they start asking
you too much, be like,

27:35.377 --> 27:36.777
"Man, I'm just here
to do my time."

27:36.845 --> 27:39.880
- Got arrested with 200 Lortabs.

27:40.049 --> 27:42.049
- Let's add to the fact
that you had some Lortabs,

27:42.151 --> 27:45.018
and when they searched your
car, you had a syringe.

27:45.120 --> 27:48.588
- I'm an insurance
agent, and I was stealing

27:48.691 --> 27:50.357
small amounts of money.

27:50.426 --> 27:53.326
If someone looks up, Brian
Miller Insurance Agent

27:53.429 --> 27:55.662
in the state of Indiana,
nothing's gonna come up.

27:55.764 --> 27:57.164
I'm concerned about that.

27:57.332 --> 27:58.331
- Um, we'll switch it then.

27:58.434 --> 27:59.533
You're not an insurance agent,

27:59.635 --> 28:01.168
you work at an
insurance company.

28:01.270 --> 28:02.402
- Okay.

28:02.438 --> 28:05.138
- My husband, military,
came back from Afghanistan,

28:05.274 --> 28:07.074
he got injured, and
we needed money.

28:07.176 --> 28:09.076
I take Adderall,
I sold my pills,

28:09.178 --> 28:10.510
and I ran out and
I needed some and--

28:10.612 --> 28:12.079
- We're gonna scratch that.

28:12.247 --> 28:13.914
Let's flip it that you
were gettin' prescriptions

28:14.083 --> 28:16.283
for your husband, 'cause
he's on pain meds,

28:16.351 --> 28:17.617
VA's not helpin' him.

28:17.720 --> 28:18.819
- Gotchya.

28:18.921 --> 28:21.054
- Each cover story has
to fit the participant,

28:21.190 --> 28:22.789
has to make sense
for Clark County,

28:22.891 --> 28:24.458
and you have to keep to it.

28:24.660 --> 28:25.826
That's why in training,
we're still tweaking

28:25.928 --> 28:27.994
the cover story, so
it seems believable.

28:28.097 --> 28:32.332
If you say somethin', your
story can never change.

28:32.434 --> 28:34.000
Any other questions?

28:34.169 --> 28:36.269
- I'm sure I have
a ton of questions

28:36.338 --> 28:39.106
and things to think
about and say.

28:40.843 --> 28:42.709
- I appreciate
what you're doing,

28:42.811 --> 28:45.312
on behalf of the county,
and Clark County Jail.

28:45.380 --> 28:47.114
Thank you, thank you.

28:50.285 --> 28:52.853
- Now that I know what
you are and what you do,

28:52.988 --> 28:54.588
I kinda feel
different about you.

28:54.723 --> 28:56.590
- Just hold on the
hate, just hold on.

28:56.658 --> 28:58.892
- The minute I met him, I knew,

28:58.961 --> 29:00.761
I felt law enforcement.

29:00.929 --> 29:02.295
I hope he can hold
his cover, because

29:02.397 --> 29:04.431
I smelled him a mile away.

29:04.500 --> 29:06.099
They're gonna smell him out.

29:06.235 --> 29:07.400
- If somebody says
somethin', instead of just

29:07.503 --> 29:09.236
going on a tangent
like I typically do,

29:09.371 --> 29:10.570
just stonewall.

29:11.874 --> 29:16.143
- Aw, I'm nervous about your
stonewall thing. (laughing)

29:16.245 --> 29:17.377
- You're excited?

29:17.479 --> 29:20.480
I'm anxious about being
able to get through this

29:20.582 --> 29:23.316
in a way that I come out
better on the other side.

29:23.418 --> 29:28.054
- If you slip on one
thing, then it's just like,

29:28.157 --> 29:29.956
it could be very bad.

29:33.595 --> 29:36.596
(electronic humming)

29:37.633 --> 29:40.033
- I haven't played in so long.

29:40.969 --> 29:42.702
- Aw, you talkin' about you
ain't played in forever,

29:42.805 --> 29:44.004
come on, you
already had a shoot.

29:44.106 --> 29:45.105
- What, I haven't.

29:45.240 --> 29:48.108
(suspenseful music)

29:49.444 --> 29:50.544
- You out to make
it on the first one,

29:50.646 --> 29:53.246
I still can't shoot free throws.

29:58.120 --> 29:59.786
- Woo, I'm getting good now.

29:59.855 --> 30:01.922
- So I wanted to talk
to you about the program

30:02.057 --> 30:03.757
and stuff, that we doin'.

30:03.859 --> 30:05.559
I kinda didn't go into details,

30:05.694 --> 30:08.895
'cause I wanted to talk to
you by ourselves and stuff,

30:08.997 --> 30:13.967
but basically, I'll be
going into a prison.

30:14.069 --> 30:15.001
- Doing research?

30:15.070 --> 30:19.773
- I gonna be in there,
like livin', like--

30:20.409 --> 30:21.208
- Huh?

30:23.378 --> 30:24.511
As a prisoner?

30:25.380 --> 30:28.081
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

30:28.183 --> 30:29.816
- Can you pour me a
glass of water please?

30:29.918 --> 30:30.817
- Yeah.

30:30.919 --> 30:32.619
- This is the last
night before I leave.

30:32.721 --> 30:34.120
I'm taking a deep breath in.

30:34.223 --> 30:35.522
- So what are you in for?

30:35.624 --> 30:38.058
- A warrant for crack and gun.

30:38.961 --> 30:40.961
I'm trying to rehearse
my cover story,

30:41.063 --> 30:42.095
and just tryin' to get ready.

30:42.197 --> 30:44.264
- If you just stick with
it, you should be okay.

30:44.366 --> 30:47.400
You don't owe anybody
any explanation.

30:48.337 --> 30:50.737
- What's happenin',
good to see ya brother.

30:50.873 --> 30:52.505
- I still gotta little bit
of time for me to relax

30:52.608 --> 30:54.608
before I need to kinda
get my head in the game.

30:54.710 --> 30:56.343
Thank ya'll for
all this, the food,

30:56.445 --> 30:58.812
thanks for watchin' after
my lady while I'm gone.

30:58.914 --> 31:00.447
- Is this the
longest time you two

31:00.582 --> 31:02.148
are gonna be apart
in your relationship?

31:02.284 --> 31:05.685
- Mhmm, yeah, so it's gonna
suck being Chris-less.

31:05.754 --> 31:06.987
(laughing)

31:07.089 --> 31:10.290
I'm very nervous
about his safety.

31:10.392 --> 31:11.558
- [Ryan] Do you
uh, still need this?

31:11.660 --> 31:13.727
- Yeah, I will here in a second.

31:13.829 --> 31:16.296
- I have to actually
tell ya somethin'.

31:16.398 --> 31:20.533
I enrolled in a program,
and I am going to jail.

31:20.669 --> 31:21.701
- To jail?

31:21.803 --> 31:25.305
- Yeah, in a program
for a sheriff,

31:25.407 --> 31:26.706
it's for a sheriff,
he'll know about it.

31:26.842 --> 31:28.041
- You're not in trouble?

31:28.143 --> 31:30.143
- [Ryan] No,
I'm not in trouble.

31:30.279 --> 31:33.313
- You're gonna
voluntarily go to jail,

31:34.716 --> 31:37.183
to do research?

31:37.286 --> 31:39.085
- My stepdad does
disapprove of my plan.

31:39.187 --> 31:41.655
He doesn't understand,
I guess um,

31:41.757 --> 31:44.291
that someone just kind
of wants to be in jail.

31:44.426 --> 31:46.092
It's not that I wanna be
in jail, really though,

31:46.194 --> 31:48.328
it's that I wanna learn
somethin' about myself.

31:48.463 --> 31:51.364
- [Kendra] So you go
in there as a prisoner?

31:51.466 --> 31:52.299
- Yes.

31:54.403 --> 31:56.202
- So you could get hurt?

31:56.305 --> 31:57.704
- It's gonna be
some negative but,

31:57.806 --> 32:01.374
I feel like it'll be so much
better as a criminologist.

32:01.476 --> 32:03.376
- It could, of course,
help his career.

32:03.512 --> 32:07.280
I just can't get over
the fact that it's jail.

32:09.551 --> 32:10.250
- [Dustin] Hey ladies.

32:10.319 --> 32:11.251
- Yes.

32:11.286 --> 32:12.919
- We wanted to talk to
you guys for a minute.

32:13.055 --> 32:16.122
- I've been asked to
go to another prison.

32:16.224 --> 32:18.858
I'm not gonna be
gone very long, okay?

32:18.961 --> 32:21.695
There's a lot at stake,
for me, doing this program,

32:21.763 --> 32:24.898
because what if I decide,
"Hey you know what?

32:25.033 --> 32:26.199
"This isn't for me."

32:26.335 --> 32:28.001
Then I'm looking at
all of this like,

32:28.103 --> 32:30.403
"I don't wanna do
this, I miss my kids,

32:30.472 --> 32:32.305
"I just wanna go home."

32:34.176 --> 32:35.175
- [Ashleigh] Everybody
uses the same toilet?

32:35.243 --> 32:37.610
- Uh huh, it's a metal
toilet, there's no lid,

32:37.713 --> 32:39.012
so you're sitting
straight on the metal.

32:39.114 --> 32:39.980
- Seriously?

32:40.082 --> 32:40.914
- Yeah.

32:41.016 --> 32:41.748
- Here you go.

32:41.850 --> 32:43.016
- Thank you.

32:43.151 --> 32:45.585
The ability to choose to
have good food on demand

32:45.721 --> 32:48.054
is something I'll probably miss.

32:48.123 --> 32:49.155
- Oh, that smells
good, is that garlic?

32:49.257 --> 32:50.290
- [Janie] Garlic green beans.

32:50.325 --> 32:51.524
- Green beans, mmm, I'm
sure they'll have lots

32:51.626 --> 32:52.525
of this for me.

32:52.594 --> 32:53.994
(laughing)

32:54.096 --> 32:54.828
In jail.

32:54.930 --> 32:55.662
- Oh wow.

32:55.764 --> 32:56.730
- Oh man, that was fast.

32:56.798 --> 32:58.932
I wanna smell the aroma
of the fresh salmon.

32:59.034 --> 33:00.133
They said the peanut butter

33:00.235 --> 33:02.035
and jelly sandwiches
are to die for.

33:02.137 --> 33:04.004
- To die of, or die for?

33:04.139 --> 33:05.839
(laughing)

33:05.941 --> 33:06.906
- Bzzzz.

33:07.009 --> 33:07.841
- He loves that.

33:07.876 --> 33:10.577
I am feeling all
kinds of emotions.

33:10.712 --> 33:13.146
I will miss my
family like crazy.

33:13.215 --> 33:15.382
They are the
highlight of my life.

33:15.517 --> 33:16.282
Hi baby.

33:17.652 --> 33:18.518
- Micah.

33:19.421 --> 33:21.221
- [Brian] The kids
are gonna miss you.

33:21.323 --> 33:22.455
- I could not do
this without you,

33:22.557 --> 33:24.791
so thank you for letting
me do this for us.

33:24.926 --> 33:26.626
- [Janie] You're welcome.

33:26.695 --> 33:30.030
- Shocking news, I
have to say the least.

33:30.132 --> 33:32.732
- I'm gonna miss my family,
I'm gonna miss everything.

33:32.834 --> 33:34.234
There's much to consider.

33:34.369 --> 33:36.603
It's not gonna be a walk
in the park to be in jail.

33:36.705 --> 33:37.537
- [Dustin] Honey,
we're a family,

33:37.606 --> 33:38.805
we can get through this.

33:38.907 --> 33:41.174
- When it's all over with, we
can go anywhere you wanna go.

33:41.276 --> 33:42.609
- Even Disney World?

33:42.711 --> 33:44.477
(laughing)

33:44.579 --> 33:47.881
- I'll see what I can do,
maybe Disney Land, okay?

33:47.983 --> 33:49.516
- The hell wrong witchu?

33:49.618 --> 33:52.352
Don't no black people
volunteer to go to jail.

33:52.454 --> 33:55.388
I been there, just want
you to be safe, dude.

33:55.490 --> 33:56.589
- [Dion] Right.

33:56.691 --> 33:59.259
(dramatic music)

34:09.838 --> 34:11.938
- It's very unsettling.

34:12.040 --> 34:13.672
It makes me very anxious.

34:13.775 --> 34:16.876
I am breaking completely
out of my comfort zone.

34:16.978 --> 34:17.710
- How are you feeling?

34:17.813 --> 34:19.112
- Not ready to leave yet.

34:19.214 --> 34:19.913
- I know.

34:20.014 --> 34:21.281
- That's a good girl.

34:21.382 --> 34:23.283
The dogs, they're more
family than anything.

34:23.418 --> 34:26.585
They do give a certain amount
of routine, I'll miss that.

34:26.721 --> 34:28.054
(child crying)

34:28.190 --> 34:29.556
- Oooh, baby.

34:29.658 --> 34:31.190
Gettin' ready to walk
away from my family

34:31.293 --> 34:34.293
for, I don't even know how long.

34:34.429 --> 34:35.295
I'm gonna miss you too.

34:35.397 --> 34:36.663
- (sighing) It's
gonna suck being away

34:36.764 --> 34:38.197
from everything for so long.

34:38.266 --> 34:39.732
Feeew, it's gettin'
a little bit harder

34:39.835 --> 34:41.935
to breathe a little bit now.

34:42.036 --> 34:43.069
- You about ready?

34:43.170 --> 34:44.137
- Almost.

34:44.272 --> 34:47.107
I'm feelin' uneasy
about not having my man

34:47.208 --> 34:49.074
in my space, and not being able

34:49.210 --> 34:51.911
to talk to my daughter or have
any interactions with her.

34:52.013 --> 34:54.848
I'm gonna have to dig real
deep to find my strength.

34:54.949 --> 34:55.849
- How do you feel?

34:55.884 --> 34:58.818
- It's a bandaid that
I wanna pull off.

34:58.920 --> 35:00.653
I'm not gonna be at
home with my family,

35:00.789 --> 35:02.122
to protect them,
and, I'm feeling

35:02.257 --> 35:04.357
a little bit of,
perhaps, regret.

35:04.426 --> 35:05.959
- I'm sure you've
thought it through.

35:06.061 --> 35:07.460
I will be worried.

35:07.562 --> 35:08.928
- I really don't know
how it's gonna end up.

35:08.997 --> 35:10.897
I guess I'm just gonna have
to pull the trigger and go.

35:11.032 --> 35:12.599
- Man, it's freakin'
me out a little bit.

35:12.701 --> 35:14.267
I feel like when the doors shut,

35:14.402 --> 35:15.368
I'm gonna be like,
"Oh, (bleep)."

35:15.470 --> 35:17.637
(trunk slamming)

35:17.772 --> 35:19.372
- Ready to get it over with.

35:19.508 --> 35:20.974
- [Kendra] The taxi is here.

35:21.109 --> 35:22.208
- Give me one.

35:23.211 --> 35:25.345
- Take care of my babies, honey.

35:25.447 --> 35:26.379
Bye, guys.

35:26.515 --> 35:27.213
- [Janie] I'll be
praying for you.

35:27.349 --> 35:28.348
- Thank you.

35:28.450 --> 35:29.949
- I just hope that, he'll
know what he's doing.

35:30.051 --> 35:31.518
- Bye, bye.

35:31.653 --> 35:33.419
- [Dion] See ya'll later.

35:33.522 --> 35:36.723
- You be safe.
- [Chris] Yes, ma'am.

35:36.825 --> 35:37.857
- Going to jail.

35:37.959 --> 35:39.425
- Love you, baby.

35:41.129 --> 35:42.896
- Bye babe, love you.

35:48.370 --> 35:50.470
(crying)

35:57.546 --> 35:59.846
(electronic humming)

35:59.948 --> 36:02.949
(suspenseful music)

36:05.053 --> 36:08.221
(garage door humming)

36:09.057 --> 36:11.224
- [Scottie] Here they are.

36:17.499 --> 36:18.498
How ya feelin'?

36:18.567 --> 36:20.633
- Don't have any words
right now, I just, woah.

36:20.769 --> 36:22.635
- This is chief Brad Jones,
he's gonna be bringing you in.

36:22.737 --> 36:23.603
- Hey, nice to meet ya.

36:23.772 --> 36:26.406
- [Quintin] Pleased to meet you.

36:28.977 --> 36:30.543
- He's got two pair
of handcuffs for you.

36:30.679 --> 36:31.678
- Oh (bleep), it's time.

36:31.813 --> 36:32.812
- Yeah, it's time.

36:32.914 --> 36:34.647
Alright, put this
hand right here.

36:34.816 --> 36:36.983
- Quite frankly, I'm
scared as (bleep).

36:37.118 --> 36:38.685
I have to find out for myself,

36:38.787 --> 36:41.020
because I wanna know, what
my daughter's going through

36:41.156 --> 36:44.857
first and foremost,
and I'm prayin',

36:44.960 --> 36:47.026
that nothin' happens to
her while I'm in here.

36:47.162 --> 36:48.361
- Sergeant Ferree
is gonna be the one

36:48.463 --> 36:52.232
that's taking you into
the Clark County Jail.

36:55.971 --> 36:58.771
Here is your Crawford
County jumpsuit.

36:58.907 --> 37:00.540
We're bringing 'em in
under the assumption,

37:00.675 --> 37:03.743
from another county transfer,
to mix the cover stories up.

37:03.878 --> 37:07.046
Remember the cover stories,
that's very, very important.

37:07.182 --> 37:08.548
- [Sheri] I think I'm in shock.

37:08.683 --> 37:11.718
The one thing I'm most concerned
about is giving up control.

37:11.820 --> 37:13.553
I've never had to
do that before.

37:13.688 --> 37:16.589
I'm the officer, I'm the mom.

37:16.691 --> 37:18.124
- He's gonna place ya under
arrest, take ya to jail.

37:18.226 --> 37:19.058
- Okay.

37:20.262 --> 37:21.594
I'm ready to do this.

37:21.696 --> 37:22.762
(handcuffs clicking)

37:22.797 --> 37:24.297
I think I definitely
would be able to blend in,

37:24.399 --> 37:28.568
like, it's the same people I
grew up with up in Detroit.

37:30.605 --> 37:32.438
(car door slamming)

37:32.574 --> 37:36.609
- You're gonna put Crawford
County jumpsuits on.

37:38.079 --> 37:40.346
- I'm gettin'
sweaty and anxious.

37:40.482 --> 37:42.882
The closer it's getting
to that cell shutting,

37:43.018 --> 37:45.251
my stomach's startin to turn.

37:45.387 --> 37:46.953
(drum beating)

37:47.088 --> 37:48.454
- I've never been
to jail before,

37:48.590 --> 37:51.090
I've never been arrested, I
have never been handcuffed.

37:51.159 --> 37:53.192
(banging)

37:53.295 --> 37:56.129
- My heart just kind of sank.

37:56.264 --> 37:59.132
- [Officer] I'll
take your belongings.

37:59.301 --> 38:03.136
- [Ashleigh] It's kind of
like a, hopeless feeling.

38:03.238 --> 38:05.238
You're not free anymore.

38:07.008 --> 38:10.076
(car door slamming)

38:10.178 --> 38:12.745
(drum beating)

38:19.321 --> 38:20.887
- [Monalisa] It's kind
of a rude awakening.

38:20.989 --> 38:23.423
I don't want to feel anxious.

38:24.392 --> 38:26.326
- [Ryan] People do think
I'm insane for doing this.

38:26.461 --> 38:28.261
I already know enough out
there, this is somethin'

38:28.363 --> 38:30.897
I can only learn about
now, and I'm ready.

38:30.999 --> 38:33.900
- Okay, okay, game
face, game face.

38:35.103 --> 38:37.270
(sighing)

38:39.207 --> 38:41.541
(suspenseful music)

38:41.643 --> 38:43.843
(yelling)

38:45.714 --> 38:47.880
(buzzing)

38:51.653 --> 38:53.886
(laughing)

38:55.223 --> 38:57.390
- [Inmate] Oh my
God, my shoulder!

38:57.492 --> 38:58.958
I ain't do nothin' wrong.

38:59.060 --> 39:01.227
(buzzing)

39:05.200 --> 39:07.633
- Walk on around
that way, please.

39:07.736 --> 39:09.435
- I gonna explode.

39:09.571 --> 39:11.170
- [Officer] Have you ever
been in jail before, ma'am?

39:11.272 --> 39:12.271
- No.

39:12.407 --> 39:14.574
(yelling)

39:15.910 --> 39:18.611
- [Prisoner] Get outta my face.

39:22.817 --> 39:25.752
- [Prisoner] Can somebody
else please help me!

39:25.887 --> 39:27.520
Please, please!

39:27.655 --> 39:29.856
(clanging)

39:34.396 --> 39:36.562
(yelling)

39:37.966 --> 39:40.600
(door banging)

39:45.373 --> 39:48.474
(chatter)

40:01.656 --> 40:06.392
- Uh, the uh, whaddya
call it, you mean the pod?

40:06.494 --> 40:07.326
- The pod?

40:11.633 --> 40:14.267
Are you a white-collar criminal?

40:18.473 --> 40:20.807
(laughing)

40:30.552 --> 40:34.120
- (mumbles)
[beep]

40:34.222 --> 40:37.323
(heavy drum beating)

40:50.271 --> 40:53.372
- As soon as I sat down,
it was like, a fly swarm.

40:53.475 --> 40:57.443
"What are you in for, where
you from, what's your name?"

40:57.579 --> 40:59.445
- They've decided, "Okay,
the game is gonna be,

40:59.547 --> 41:03.749
"we're gonna make homosexual
advances toward Brian."

41:04.552 --> 41:06.853
(laughing)

41:07.889 --> 41:09.455
- [Inmate] Yeah.

41:10.391 --> 41:13.092
- I'm in a pod, with
so many (bleep) drugs,

41:13.194 --> 41:14.994
and they are so high.

41:17.899 --> 41:20.066
- My stomach's turnin',
can't keep food down.

41:20.201 --> 41:22.468
(vomiting)

41:22.604 --> 41:25.538
- As far as what's going on
with my husband and I at home.

41:25.673 --> 41:27.607
Are you (bleep)
kidding me right now?

41:27.742 --> 41:30.710
I (bleep) hate you.

41:31.746 --> 41:33.079
(banging)

41:33.248 --> 41:35.281
- If you were minding too much
in other people's business,

41:35.383 --> 41:36.849
like, "What are you,
you want some too?"

41:36.985 --> 41:38.918
(smacking)

41:39.053 --> 41:40.686
- I'm stuck in here.

41:42.023 --> 41:43.856
- [Inmate] That is
(bleep) water and piss.

41:43.958 --> 41:45.725
- You had raw sewage.

41:50.698 --> 41:52.965
(groaning)

41:53.305 --> 41:59.945
