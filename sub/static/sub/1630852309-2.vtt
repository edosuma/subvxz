00:36.240 --> 00:39.399
Greetings, Great King.

00:51.280 --> 00:54.719
I didn't even know that
I had followers in Nidaros-

00:54.799 --> 00:58.320
-before I saw your dedication
in the comment section.

00:59.039 --> 01:02.600
It's good
to finally meet you in person.

01:02.679 --> 01:09.239
"True men meet in sweat and sword,
not on electronic webs."

01:09.319 --> 01:15.359
You've been paying attention,
I see... How did the mission go?

01:15.439 --> 01:18.439
We think the result
will please the King.

01:37.640 --> 01:41.400
The son has risen from the grave.

01:42.480 --> 01:46.280
To give his father back his name.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.120
It was King Magnus the Good's
grave that was vandalised-

01:56.200 --> 01:58.760
-during last night's break-in
at Nidaros Cathedral.

01:58.840 --> 02:01.319
The remains were located
underneath the cathedral floor.

02:01.400 --> 02:06.680
It was one of the few known burial
sites of the early Norwegian kings.

02:06.760 --> 02:10.120
We'll just have
to start without Alfhildr.

02:10.199 --> 02:15.000
People. Now, the murder in
the tunnel, and the investigation-

02:15.080 --> 02:19.039
-of a possible link to the historic
killer Jack the Ripper-

02:19.120 --> 02:22.120
-is the top priority
of this department.

03:42.080 --> 03:44.120
Lars assists them. Jørn and Alex-

03:44.199 --> 03:48.680
-you follow up
on the witness statements..

03:48.759 --> 03:51.080
Greetings.

03:58.759 --> 04:01.520
-Alfhildr?
-Alfhildr...

04:05.280 --> 04:07.800
I think maybe
she walked here in her sleep.

04:13.039 --> 04:16.360
Read the latest news.
The Citizen!

04:17.160 --> 04:22.480
Is the community of Old Norse Faith
behind the vandalising of the grave?

04:34.000 --> 04:36.480
Come see me afterwards.

04:37.600 --> 04:40.600
Good morning, Miss Winter.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.720
I was thinking of...

05:31.079 --> 05:34.639
She came to. Wenche had an extra set
of clothes in her locker.

05:34.720 --> 05:39.240
-She wants to carry on working.
-You know the sleep disturbances-

05:39.319 --> 05:43.120
-that affect some of
the timeigrants, are you not?

05:53.399 --> 05:57.160
-Sorry about before.
-I'm happy to see you're feeling.

05:57.800 --> 06:01.079
-Perhaps you should take the day off?
-No, I'm fine.

06:01.160 --> 06:04.399
-I just sleepwalked.
-You appeared to be rather confused.

06:04.480 --> 06:09.000
Have you considered that it could
be... more than regular sleepwalking?

06:09.079 --> 06:11.680
No.
There's nothing more.

06:14.959 --> 06:18.600
-Where are we going?
-Are you up to going anywhere now?

06:18.680 --> 06:20.920
I feel fine!

06:21.360 --> 06:26.439
The Citizen just got a letter that
could be linked to the Tunnel-murder.

06:26.519 --> 06:29.480
Get a whiff of this one.

06:31.560 --> 06:33.800
It's all right...

06:37.519 --> 06:39.720
-Are you the one who called?
-Indeed.

06:39.800 --> 06:43.639
The abomination is in there, so...
You can follow me.

06:49.639 --> 06:52.040
What the hell is that?

06:59.120 --> 07:03.480
"Dear Citizen, I send you this bloody
piece of womanly flesh,"-

07:03.560 --> 07:06.600
-"to inform the public
that dusk has fallen."

07:06.680 --> 07:10.199
Not to stir things up,
but this has obvious similarities-

07:10.279 --> 07:13.040
-with a letter from
the original Ripper case.

07:21.879 --> 07:25.920
-Yes...
-We must close off the premises.

07:26.439 --> 07:28.680
A team of forensics are coming.

07:28.759 --> 07:31.639
This has to do with the slaying
in the Tunnel of Tears?

07:31.720 --> 07:34.680
-It's too early to say.
-We have heard rumours that-

07:34.759 --> 07:37.879
-the victim
had been mutilated down below.

07:37.959 --> 07:40.839
Let's not let
our imagination run away with us.

07:40.920 --> 07:46.120
That thing is probably just a piece
of steak from some eager reader.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.920
A bird just came.

08:30.759 --> 08:33.000
"The sun shines
on the mountain at midnight."

08:33.080 --> 08:37.000
-What is the message?
-It seems we can expect visitors.

08:38.720 --> 08:41.200
From the distant abroad.

08:41.279 --> 08:43.919
In the office to the right.

08:45.879 --> 08:51.039
Will you update management and UK,
while we hold the fort down here?

08:52.200 --> 08:58.080
Section leader of OPK Harald Eriksen
said this about the speculation that-

08:58.159 --> 09:02.639
-the English police are
investigating the tunnel murder:

09:02.720 --> 09:07.799
We do not confirm nor refute
information that is based on rumours.

09:11.200 --> 09:14.480
Welcome to this workshop.
My name is Gorgosh.

09:14.559 --> 09:16.960
It means soft on the outside,
hard on the inside.

09:17.039 --> 09:20.039
You can call me Goggen. It's
a bit easier for you to remember.

09:20.120 --> 09:24.879
This is concerning structural timeism
in public sector, and the police...

09:24.960 --> 09:28.600
-What did we find at The Citizen?
-A letter.

09:28.679 --> 09:30.679
Most likely from the perpetrator.

09:30.759 --> 09:33.759
It contained what appeared
to be a bloody body part.

09:33.840 --> 09:37.799
-Probably a severed clitoris.
-My God.

09:39.360 --> 09:43.000
-What does Scotland Yard say?
-They're not answering my calls.

09:44.080 --> 09:47.639
Keep trying. We have to get
English police in the loop on this.

09:47.720 --> 09:51.799
Let's start by trying
our way of greeting.

09:51.879 --> 09:55.679
Hi!
Do you have time for a quick chat?

09:55.759 --> 10:00.120
Not really. The case I'm working on
has taken a dramatic turn.

10:07.039 --> 10:11.559
The health services received a note
of concern from the higher ups.

10:11.639 --> 10:14.639
I explained that
it's nothing to worry about.

10:14.720 --> 10:18.600
Sleep disturbances among
beforeigners can be very serious.

10:18.679 --> 10:22.159
It is our duty to make sure our
officers take their health seriously.

10:22.240 --> 10:26.559
-I do. I went for a consultation.
-Really? With your doctor?

10:26.639 --> 10:30.320
With a knowledgeable woman
from the old faith.

10:30.399 --> 10:33.840
The old faith...
I don't think we should pursue that.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.639
So health services don't
approve of me-

10:40.720 --> 10:44.600
-approaching the problem with
the tools available in my culture?

10:44.679 --> 10:50.720
Yes. Of course we do, Alfhildr.
This came out all wrong.

11:02.480 --> 11:04.480
Is there anything
in the witness statements?

11:04.559 --> 11:07.120
We can conclude
that those tunnel witnesses,-

11:07.200 --> 11:11.960
-they are the least reliable
witnesses we've ever encountered.

11:12.879 --> 11:18.120
-What about the CC-TV from Tøyen?
-Sorry, no. Those files are gone.

11:20.559 --> 11:23.960
-Gone?
-But I'll try to recover them.

11:24.720 --> 11:29.000
In the middle of all this, management
decides to hold a workshop.

11:29.080 --> 11:32.679
Okay, everyone.
It's time for the wine lottery!

11:32.759 --> 11:35.320
Today we're going for
a bit of a mead theme.

11:35.399 --> 11:40.360
Of course there's a mead lottery.
This is Oslo Police Department.

11:43.440 --> 11:48.480
I must say, you have
this vehicle all under control.

11:48.559 --> 11:51.000
For a timeigrant, I mean.

11:51.080 --> 11:54.720
Yes, I've had worse horses
between my legs.

11:58.080 --> 12:00.720
-Yes.
-The plan is set in motion.

12:00.799 --> 12:04.120
-That is good news.
-King Olav...

12:04.200 --> 12:07.639
We don't use that thing in the car.
Hang it up.

12:07.720 --> 12:12.039
It's not allowed. It is because
it distracts you when you're driving.

12:12.120 --> 12:14.720
You can't talk, and it's...

12:16.200 --> 12:19.200
-Didn't you have a duty to yield?
-No.

12:19.600 --> 12:22.759
Olaf Haraldsson yields to no one.

13:42.600 --> 13:44.879
Odin commands you to read.

13:47.320 --> 13:50.000
You are not Odin.

13:50.679 --> 13:52.879
You are a weird hag I imagine,-

13:52.960 --> 13:56.960
-because my head has a hard time
getting off the temproxat.

14:00.679 --> 14:03.919
-Respect Odin.
-What the fuck?

14:04.360 --> 14:08.480
-I said, respect Odin!
-Okay. Fine. Fine.

14:41.440 --> 14:45.720
Just drop it, okay?
That book is a dead end.

14:46.080 --> 14:51.279
So, you don't think the library it is
borrowed from, creates doubt-

14:51.360 --> 14:55.480
-about the people who claims
to be from Scotland Yard?

15:18.600 --> 15:20.519
Hi.

15:20.840 --> 15:25.240
-Did you hear from the English?
-No. No, it's a little odd.

15:26.519 --> 15:29.360
I'm starting to get
a bad vibe about this, Harald.

15:29.440 --> 15:32.039
-Sure they are from Scotland Yard?
-Of course.

15:32.120 --> 15:36.159
What kind
of documentation did they present?

15:36.240 --> 15:40.639
Honestly, Lars,
now you seem a little paranoid.

15:40.720 --> 15:44.200
This is a book Rubinstein gave me.

15:44.279 --> 15:47.080
One thing is
that it seems irrelevant.

15:47.159 --> 15:50.720
But what's worse is that this copy
comes from a patient library-

15:50.799 --> 15:54.399
- at a mental insititution.
-Probably a good reason for that.

15:54.480 --> 15:56.960
I contacted HR at MPS.

15:57.039 --> 16:01.159
They don't have a consultant from
the 19th century named Rubinstein.

16:01.240 --> 16:05.600
A Precious Clark
is listed among the staff.

16:05.679 --> 16:11.720
But her phone number doesn't match
the business card she gave us.

16:16.240 --> 16:20.399
Well... We'd better try the
number you have found then.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.600
Yes, don't you think?

16:25.200 --> 16:27.720
Homicide Command,
Precious Clark speaking.

16:27.799 --> 16:30.320
Good to finally reach you,
Miss Clark.

16:30.399 --> 16:32.879
This is Eriksen from the Oslo police.

16:32.960 --> 16:36.279
We need to discuss
a development in the Ripper case.

16:36.360 --> 16:38.799
We need to discuss a what?

16:39.639 --> 16:42.919
Hello..?
Is this some kind of prank?

16:43.000 --> 16:48.159
Your voice tells me you are not the
investigator we were working with.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.600
Could it be a mix up
with a colleague with a similar name?

16:51.679 --> 16:55.840
There's only one Precious Clark in
Homicide, and that's yours truly.

17:08.119 --> 17:12.480
First of all, I would
like to apologise...to everyone.

17:14.160 --> 17:17.200
It seems we've
been tricked by two imposters-

17:17.279 --> 17:20.039
-pretending to be British officers.

17:20.559 --> 17:23.839
Have London indicated
who these imposters might be?

17:23.920 --> 17:28.640
They suspect that they have ties
to that Neo-Luddite community.

17:28.720 --> 17:32.039
Those 19th century people
who hate machines?

17:32.119 --> 17:35.480
-What's supposed to be their motive?
-We didn't discuss that.

17:35.559 --> 17:38.000
Scotland Yard have
no faith in the Ripper-theory?

17:38.079 --> 17:40.799
-No, none at all.
-No?

17:42.319 --> 17:45.599
We'll do the briefing together.

17:46.519 --> 17:49.079
-Hello again.
-Great to meet you.

17:49.160 --> 17:51.519
I'm the real Precious Clark
from Homicide.

17:51.599 --> 17:55.640
Joining me is senior investigator
Henry Black from SO15.

17:55.720 --> 17:58.200
Oh, good you could join us.

17:58.279 --> 18:00.680
Let me again apologise
for this terrible mess.

18:00.759 --> 18:04.359
We received your footage, and we
believe this is the individual-

18:04.440 --> 18:07.400
-responsible for
assuming Miss Clark's identity.

18:07.480 --> 18:11.200
-Could be her.
-She is a timeigrant from Nigeria.

18:11.559 --> 18:16.880
Known by her African name, Adepero
Abeke. She's with the Neo-Luddites.

18:16.960 --> 18:19.960
And the guy
who called himself Mr. Rubinstein?

18:20.039 --> 18:23.799
-We don't have anything on him yet.
-I might have a lead.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.680
The man gave us
a book that turned out to be-

18:26.759 --> 18:29.400
-from the library
of a mental institution.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.480
Have you contacted the library?

18:31.559 --> 18:36.720
Our legal team is making a request
about handing over information.

18:37.440 --> 18:41.720
Keep us posted on that.
Identifying him is a priority.

19:17.920 --> 19:21.720
I have to go on a journey
and need a favor.

19:22.400 --> 19:27.720
I have gathered my earthly belongings
and want you to keep them.

19:27.799 --> 19:32.920
Help my family
if something befalls me.

19:35.240 --> 19:40.319
The journey you are going on,
is it to the lighthouse down south-

19:40.400 --> 19:43.599
-that we conversed about earlier?

19:44.319 --> 19:46.880
I have no choice.

19:47.519 --> 19:49.599
Jack is there.

19:51.359 --> 19:54.680
God has given me
a vocation to stop him.

19:54.759 --> 19:59.160
How do you know
the vocation is from God?

19:59.720 --> 20:04.720
The devil can also
plant seeds in a sensitive mind.

20:06.200 --> 20:10.119
It's from God.
I am certain.

20:25.640 --> 20:28.720
Dad must go away for a while.

20:28.799 --> 20:31.720
Be good to your mother.

20:46.039 --> 20:49.200
Give me one
of those trays with drinks.

20:49.279 --> 20:54.480
And don't fucking bother with
those cocktails. We're just thirsty.

20:55.960 --> 20:59.000
-Put it on the tab, then?
-What tab?

21:00.000 --> 21:02.359
-One more glass, please.
-I can't.

21:02.440 --> 21:05.400
I have to do the cash register.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.960
Farewell.

21:39.720 --> 21:42.079
Excuse me, Gentlemen.

21:42.160 --> 21:45.559
Any of you Aryan cunts
have a bottle opener?

21:48.400 --> 21:51.440
Who are you, a fuckin' jew?

22:02.400 --> 22:06.599
The long eyes are fucking good.

22:10.359 --> 22:12.599
Is it him?

22:13.279 --> 22:16.359
A little fatter than I remember...

22:27.079 --> 22:29.839
Can I have a sip?

22:31.799 --> 22:34.720
Does Satan's ass smell of ivy?

22:37.440 --> 22:40.119
It means no, mush head.

22:40.640 --> 22:44.480
Go buy your own milk
if you're so thirsty.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.720
The package is delivered.

22:49.799 --> 22:52.319
Tip off the police.

23:09.480 --> 23:12.359
What in the Lord's name?

23:12.440 --> 23:17.160
I went for a drink, and I ended up
having a disagreement with a local.

23:17.240 --> 23:20.519
Why would you do that?
We agreed to lay low.

23:20.599 --> 23:23.160
It was a misjudgment, alright?

23:23.880 --> 23:26.839
Here's our local connection.

23:30.920 --> 23:34.799
Examination has shown that
the body part isn't from a human.

23:35.319 --> 23:38.359
-But from a dolphin.
-A dolphin?

23:38.880 --> 23:43.359
I presume that
the sender meant to deceive.

23:44.119 --> 23:48.720
The dolphin's clitoris most
closely resembles that of a human.

23:49.039 --> 23:52.160
You didn't find any biological
material in the letter that-

23:52.240 --> 23:56.359
- can be tied to the crime scene?
-Everything's from the animal.

23:56.440 --> 24:00.359
To sum it up, the conclusion is
that the letter too-

24:00.440 --> 24:05.279
-is part of the Luddites'
information manipulation.

24:05.359 --> 24:10.079
This is a potential PR disaster.

24:10.160 --> 24:13.960
Nothing leaves these four walls.

24:14.039 --> 24:19.359
Not about the imposters,
nor this Jack the Ripper nonsense.

24:37.319 --> 24:39.680
The rest must be travelled by foot.

24:55.480 --> 24:58.440
Can you fathom
why they have abandoned us?

25:00.720 --> 25:05.000
Oh, well. A life without honey
is still a life, I suppose.

25:10.759 --> 25:14.079
-They just arrived.
-Have these removed.

25:29.839 --> 25:31.880
Welcome.

26:20.000 --> 26:24.279
-What is it?
-I saw several black cars outside.

26:24.880 --> 26:27.680
I think it may be an inspection.

26:43.279 --> 26:47.319
Hi. We have
a warrant to search the premises.

26:51.240 --> 26:53.599
Why?

27:13.079 --> 27:15.960
They're not here about the blót?

27:16.480 --> 27:20.319
-It seems to be about something else.
-Found something!

27:21.359 --> 27:24.279
What the hell is that?

27:25.400 --> 27:27.880
No idea.

27:53.799 --> 27:55.839
I spoke to the officer in charge.

27:55.920 --> 27:58.680
They have a warrant
to keep you overnight.

27:59.720 --> 28:03.880
What the hell?
I haven't done anything.

28:04.839 --> 28:10.200
The contents of the bag are from
a break-in at the Nidaros Cathedral.

28:10.920 --> 28:15.640
As you have the key to the basement,
you're the main suspect.

28:15.720 --> 28:17.920
This is not happening.

28:19.759 --> 28:23.880
I was trying to live a normal life.
I don't need this shit.

28:23.960 --> 28:26.079
Do you have an alibi?

28:27.279 --> 28:29.799
Were you at home on Thursday?

28:31.559 --> 28:35.200
I was at an autumn party
at the volva's place.

28:35.680 --> 28:38.119
When did the party end?

28:42.359 --> 28:47.400
The break- in was at night, but
it takes a few hours to drive there.

28:50.200 --> 28:53.000
I have no idea, Alfhildr.

28:54.119 --> 28:57.920
I remember having
some sweets when we got there.

28:58.319 --> 29:01.440
The rest is foggy.

29:02.359 --> 29:06.079
The pills in the Volva's casket
aren't sweets, Tore.

29:07.680 --> 29:09.720
It's ecstasy.

29:35.720 --> 29:37.720
Hi.

29:39.279 --> 29:41.279
What..?

29:42.240 --> 29:44.519
What has happened?

29:53.880 --> 29:56.599
There is something
I need to tell you.

29:58.519 --> 30:00.559
Yes?

30:06.759 --> 30:11.599
We... We should probably
just get this over with.

30:16.039 --> 30:18.079
I...

30:20.720 --> 30:22.720
Yes...

30:22.799 --> 30:25.359
Ingrid thinks she's pregnant.

30:28.400 --> 30:31.960
You think you're pregnant?

30:32.039 --> 30:35.480
Yes, or... I'm pretty sure.
I have taken several of those tests.

30:35.559 --> 30:39.640
An unfortunate piece of news,
no doubt about that.

30:39.720 --> 30:43.559
So, who's the father?

30:45.799 --> 30:49.880
A random person I hooked up with at
a party. A friend of that Olaf guy.

30:49.960 --> 30:54.720
Random person? I mean... Ingrid, have
you heard about contraception?

30:56.279 --> 30:59.039
I fucked up, okay?

30:59.119 --> 31:02.279
That's fine, Ingrid.
We all make mistakes.

31:02.359 --> 31:04.759
This is too modern for my taste.

31:04.839 --> 31:09.640
We're all adults here. We can't
condone such harlot behaviour.

31:09.720 --> 31:13.720
-Harlot?
-This you didn't handle very well.

31:17.160 --> 31:20.720
I noticed straight off myself...

31:20.799 --> 31:24.440
Perhaps you should go
and smoke a pipe?

31:25.440 --> 31:27.480
An excellent idea.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.480
Ingrid, take a seat.

31:36.240 --> 31:40.000
Okay.
So...

31:40.079 --> 31:42.440
Well, how far along are you?

31:43.599 --> 31:48.160
Because you're not planning on
having a baby, are you, Ingrid?

31:48.240 --> 31:51.799
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

31:51.880 --> 31:55.400
Yes, probably, but...

31:55.480 --> 31:58.160
I can't do this right now.

31:58.480 --> 32:02.559
-Ingrid!
-Give her some space.

32:03.559 --> 32:05.559
Ingrid!

32:06.039 --> 32:11.480
Ingrid, you can't just walk off like
that. We need to talk about this...

32:36.200 --> 32:38.440
What a pleasant reunion.

32:38.519 --> 32:41.119
We need to talk about Tore.

32:44.359 --> 32:47.319
Police suspect him of
the Nidaros burglary.

32:47.400 --> 32:52.960
-He says he was at a party with you.
-Don't ask me what happened there.

32:54.839 --> 32:57.839
Is there anyone else
who can remember?

32:57.920 --> 33:00.359
I'll ask around.

33:10.440 --> 33:13.799
Now, can we discuss
the important stuff?

33:15.319 --> 33:20.240
I know you think Tore blabbed
about the girl in the vest.

33:22.079 --> 33:25.640
Well...
It certainly wasn't a vision.

33:25.720 --> 33:29.480
-You didn't see it through my eyes.
-No.

33:29.559 --> 33:33.359
It wasn't a vision.
It was a memory.

33:36.680 --> 33:39.000
Whose memory?

33:41.440 --> 33:43.400
Mine.

33:47.960 --> 33:51.319
I was a slave girl
for Hårek from Tjøtta.

33:54.599 --> 33:58.039
I was there that morning
the men brought you.

34:05.160 --> 34:08.440
You were light and fair.

34:08.519 --> 34:11.880
With a brightness
from a different world.

34:21.679 --> 34:26.119
I have several memories from Tjøtta.
I don't remember you from there.

34:26.199 --> 34:29.800
Hårek released me
when he realised my powers.

34:29.880 --> 34:33.119
After that
the road was where I belonged.

34:39.960 --> 34:43.920
Please.
Let me find out what you are.

34:46.320 --> 34:48.320
How?

34:48.400 --> 34:51.679
You will have to let me
taste you down there.

34:55.239 --> 34:58.400
Is this really about witchcraft?

34:58.480 --> 35:01.159
Or are you just a horny lesbo?

35:04.039 --> 35:07.159
The one doesn't
have to exclude the other.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.599
You won't regret it.

35:12.480 --> 35:16.719
My tongue knows more
than any man's tongue.

35:31.320 --> 35:36.320
I guess you can have a couple of
licks, if it's that important to you.

36:23.599 --> 36:26.559
Aren't you going to tell me
what you saw?

36:29.599 --> 36:31.880
I didn't see much.

36:34.920 --> 36:37.199
What do you mean?

36:40.320 --> 36:44.119
I saw your eyes turn inwards
when you where down there.

36:44.199 --> 36:47.800
I know when I have a vision, okay?

36:49.360 --> 36:51.679
I didn't have a vision.

37:50.440 --> 37:54.280
It must be him.
What was he treated for?

37:54.360 --> 37:58.760
-Paranoid schizophrenia.
-I can't say I'm surprised.

37:58.840 --> 38:04.400
It was when I googled the guy
that it really got interesting.

38:04.480 --> 38:07.519
He may have been involved in the
original Whitechapel investigation.

38:07.599 --> 38:11.719
You're not seriously suggesting we
dust off the Jack the Ripper theory?

38:11.800 --> 38:15.639
-You don't think this is astounding?
-It's astoundingly stupid.

38:15.719 --> 38:19.119
You heard the management: The
Jack the Ripper theory is bullshit.

38:19.199 --> 38:24.000
And we made a fool of ourselves,
buying into it. Leave it, okay?

38:25.400 --> 38:29.440
We'll call that the end of
the consultant work for now.

38:31.079 --> 38:33.119
Coming, Alfie?

38:44.400 --> 38:49.559
The Citizen! Man pushed up through
the ice after several hundred years.

38:49.639 --> 38:55.360
The Citizen!
Half price. Buy it now. The Citizen!

39:06.079 --> 39:08.400
Where were you yesterday, young lady?

39:08.480 --> 39:12.880
-Something provoked my interest.
-Is that so?

39:14.239 --> 39:17.559
-What's this?
-I looked at 19th century slayings-

39:17.639 --> 39:21.119
-with a British connection,
and I happened upon a letter-

39:21.199 --> 39:24.480
-with striking similarities
with what the paper received.

39:24.559 --> 39:27.400
To which case does this relate?

39:30.280 --> 39:35.360
The letter is supposedly written by
a certain Jack the Ripper.

39:41.639 --> 39:44.119
What are you thinking?

39:44.679 --> 39:48.719
Do you think Ben Joseph
is behind the tunnel killing?

40:23.280 --> 40:28.119
I normally like to treat my guests to
a taste of my renowned honey.

40:28.199 --> 40:33.480
-But my bees are gone, so...
-This looks wonderful.

40:36.840 --> 40:42.280
So, the arrival files
of the three women...

40:42.360 --> 40:46.320
Is that a part of
the project you are working on here?

40:47.039 --> 40:52.880
I do not intend to discuss details
of my project with local operatives.

40:54.840 --> 40:56.840
Local operatives?

40:56.920 --> 41:00.400
Mr Ben Joseph is new to the movement.

41:00.480 --> 41:05.559
He is not all together familiar
with our structural principles.

41:09.280 --> 41:11.199
I see.

41:16.119 --> 41:18.920
-The Luddites used our printer.
-Okay.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.480
They borrowed
the receptionist's guest device.

41:21.559 --> 41:25.440
Is there a way to find out
what they printed?

41:25.920 --> 41:29.239
-Yes, I can check the log.
-Yes.

41:29.960 --> 41:32.159
Good.
Do it.

43:09.440 --> 43:12.400
It's been a long time.

43:12.719 --> 43:17.480
True. Thank you
for your persistent loyalty.

43:17.559 --> 43:20.719
Until the sun goes out
and sinks into the ocean.
