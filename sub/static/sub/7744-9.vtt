JACKlE: Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:10.552 --> 00:12.220
You tell your nurses that Mike Cruz

00:12.304 --> 00:16.724
just hired a crew
to expand the elevator shaft for a helipad.

00:16.892 --> 00:20.645
l kind of wanna go to public school.
lt's closer to Dad's.

00:21.647 --> 00:24.565
Okay, well, that's certainly
something we can talk about.

00:24.900 --> 00:27.193
-That's God.
-Vermin!

00:27.319 --> 00:29.529
And he's crazy.

00:29.738 --> 00:31.572
(WHEEZlNG) You were supposed to be here.

00:32.825 --> 00:34.909
-You okay?
-Allergies.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.954
When l get nervous,
l act out with inappropriate sexual touches.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.247
lt's like Tourette's.

00:39.415 --> 00:40.456
MlKE: Where did you get the drugs?

00:40.708 --> 00:43.918
l don't work at a hospital
fucking a pharmacist.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.753
Promise me you're not gonna fire her.

00:45.838 --> 00:46.879
l promise.

00:47.172 --> 00:48.172
l'm fired?

00:48.757 --> 00:51.759
l'm gonna need your badge.
And you'll have to leave immediately, today.

(DOORBELL RlNGlNG)

01:57.743 --> 02:00.161
-Zoey, can you set the table?
-On it.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.001
Wow. You guys look great.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.755
Exit interviews.

02:11.173 --> 02:12.507
l'm starving.

02:17.012 --> 02:19.180
Tomorrow, l'm going to the dentist.

02:19.306 --> 02:21.849
And l'm gonna pick up a dog.
l've been wanting a dog.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.059
lf you're trying to make me feel better,

02:23.143 --> 02:24.268
you're just gonna make me feel worse.

02:24.353 --> 02:26.938
l'm not trying to make you feel better.
l just lost my fucking job.

02:27.022 --> 02:29.690
l'm telling you, l'm getting a dog
to make my life whole again.

02:29.775 --> 02:31.901
Okay, and you know what? l feel guilty.

02:32.027 --> 02:33.236
So now you feel guilty.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.612
Let me get this out of your way.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.030
Actually, l'm still working. Thanks, honey.

02:36.114 --> 02:40.159
You cannot take this on, Jackie.
l lost my job the day Mike Cruz showed up.

02:40.494 --> 02:43.287
And if it weren't Mike Cruz,
it would have been someone else.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.039
-She's right.
-Amen.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.374
lt's not like it used to be.

02:47.042 --> 02:50.127
Everything l loved about being a nurse
is gone. You would have loved it.

02:50.212 --> 02:53.130
No calling upstairs to ask permission
for every goddamn thing,

02:53.257 --> 02:55.508
no filling out the same form three times.

02:55.592 --> 02:56.717
Sometimes it's four.

02:57.761 --> 03:00.638
Actually, you're the one
who made us fill out things four times.

03:01.723 --> 03:04.350
Or not. lt was okay. Either way.

03:04.768 --> 03:07.103
-ls this quiche?
-lt's store-bought.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.772
Fucking Cruz. lt's gonna turn around
and bite him in the ass.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.023
Stay out of it, Jackie.

03:11.108 --> 03:12.441
Sorry, it's just hard.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.278
l know you did what you did
so l could keep my job.

03:15.362 --> 03:18.406
And now l expect you
to make sure you keep it.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.241
l'm gonna miss being in the trenches.

03:20.409 --> 03:24.078
Which is why we think
breakfast should be a regular thing.

03:25.247 --> 03:27.999
Why l think. Berries.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.586
-Hey, Fi.
-Hi, sweetie.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.045
-Hi.
-Hi.

03:33.130 --> 03:34.338
l need my lunch.

03:34.423 --> 03:36.549
Well, who's picking you up from school?

03:36.633 --> 03:38.634
We're going to Dad's. Remember?

03:38.886 --> 03:40.344
Where's your sister?

03:40.429 --> 03:41.846
Grace is on strike.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.223
l love you. See you later.

03:44.349 --> 03:45.766
Excuse me.

03:46.268 --> 03:50.062
So, l can totally text you guys highlights
from the trenches every day,

03:50.272 --> 03:51.731
sometimes even pictures.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.442
Does my phone get pictures?

04:00.073 --> 04:01.824
Dressed, now.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.744
Don't throw things at me.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.412
Put your clothes on, Grace.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.456
l told you l wanted to go to public school.

04:09.041 --> 04:10.374
l wasn't kidding.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.043
Please, not today.

04:12.127 --> 04:15.212
Dad said yes. He filled out all the forms.

04:15.297 --> 04:17.757
All you had to do
was go meet with my principal.

04:17.883 --> 04:20.760
-l will meet with your principal.
-When? Today?

04:20.844 --> 04:22.845
Look, Grace,
l know things take a little bit longer

04:22.930 --> 04:24.680
'cause your dad and l
are not in the same house.

04:24.765 --> 04:25.765

04:25.849 --> 04:27.850
l promise you, l will take care of it.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.060
You don't know what it's like

04:29.144 --> 04:32.647
to have to go to a place
that you hate every day.

04:33.482 --> 04:36.442
As a matter of fact, Grace, yes, l do.

04:38.445 --> 04:41.072
Two of my friends got fired.
Do you think l want to go to work?

04:41.156 --> 04:42.198
No, l don't.

04:42.324 --> 04:44.700
Well, Dr. O'Hara is still there, though, right?

04:45.077 --> 04:47.536
Yeah, and you know what?
She doesn't want to go to work either.

04:47.621 --> 04:50.247
But we get up, we get dressed
and we keep going,

04:50.332 --> 04:51.499
because that's what we do.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.339
Please come on downstairs. You can be late.

04:58.423 --> 05:01.300
Come have some waffles
with my sad friends.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.311
JACKlE: What's with the armbands?

05:12.854 --> 05:15.064
We're in mourning. Yours is on your desk.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.315
Wow, depressing.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.026
And we're also fundraising.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.530
That's awful, but sweet.

05:22.739 --> 05:23.864
Here.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.703
Should you be doing that
with two kids and a divorce?

05:28.787 --> 05:30.162
Yes, l should.

05:32.374 --> 05:33.958
lt's early. Why are we already packed?

05:34.042 --> 05:35.376
St. Luke's is diverting again.

05:35.544 --> 05:38.045
We're the closest,
so we're the ones getting slammed.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.798
l'd rather be busy so l don't get sad.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.299
Or mad.

05:42.384 --> 05:43.801
So what did they do?

05:43.885 --> 05:45.428
lt's hard to get fired here, believe me.

05:47.389 --> 05:50.725
ls he going to say anything to anyone
about anything?

05:50.809 --> 05:51.934
About me?

05:52.019 --> 05:53.269
Just leave it alone.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.190
Boooo.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.907
You know what this place doesn't need?

06:06.992 --> 06:07.992
A tip jar.

06:08.660 --> 06:12.329
We're raising funds for our friends
who no longer have an income.

06:12.748 --> 06:13.831
Do you have an income?

06:14.082 --> 06:15.082
l do.

06:15.584 --> 06:16.625
All right, we'll put it in the supply room.

06:16.752 --> 06:18.044
No, you'll get rid of it.

06:19.629 --> 06:20.629
Okay.

l've got Quantum Bay board members
in town for a meeting.

06:25.969 --> 06:27.011
You're gonna bring them here?

06:27.095 --> 06:28.679
Why don't you pretend like l am?

06:28.764 --> 06:30.264
And l'll pretend like l know your name.

06:30.932 --> 06:31.932
And lose the armbands.

06:32.768 --> 06:33.934
No one died.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.189
Um, people die here all the time.
lt's a hospital.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.732
l'm keeping mine on.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.567
-Take it off.
-Really?

06:43.070 --> 06:46.614
l can't handle anyone else
being fired right now. Please?

06:51.119 --> 06:52.787

This is hilarious.

07:02.297 --> 07:03.672
What? They went to college, right?

07:04.800 --> 07:06.467
l can't watch this.

07:07.302 --> 07:09.470
Coop, you have a minute? Come here.

07:13.850 --> 07:15.893
l need you to take this in and not freak out.

07:16.812 --> 07:19.146
Gloria and Eddie were fired last night.

07:21.525 --> 07:22.775
Fuck. Cruz?

07:23.193 --> 07:24.777
No, Zoey decided to let them go.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.487
How could...

07:28.615 --> 07:31.075
So that's it? They're done? l mean, why?

07:31.159 --> 07:33.994
l don't know. l don't know the details.
But l need your help today, Coop.

07:34.079 --> 07:36.497
l can't have anyone else in his crosshairs.
We just got to...

07:36.832 --> 07:38.040
Keep calm and carry on.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.543
Wow. Yes, exactly.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.419
Saw it on a poster.

07:44.339 --> 07:45.589
Okay, you need a minute?

07:45.715 --> 07:47.007
No, l'm fine.

07:48.510 --> 07:49.677
-Okay.
-Shit.

07:49.761 --> 07:52.429
Yeah, maybe l need a minute.

30-year-old male found down on the curb.

07:57.769 --> 08:00.771
Totally intoxicated. Punched me
even though he was passed out.

08:00.856 --> 08:03.941
Woke himself up to tell us
he's from Buffalo and that l'm a bitch.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.734
Why am l the only physician
on the floor right now?

08:05.819 --> 08:07.403
l don't know.
Did you fire anyone else today?

08:07.487 --> 08:09.530
No, but it's only 1 0:00.

08:09.614 --> 08:10.948
Nothing but time.

08:11.199 --> 08:13.033
l can taste my fucking fillings.

08:13.702 --> 08:15.494
-What are you doing?
-His pants are still dry.

08:15.579 --> 08:17.496
l'd like to get a catheter in there
before he pees all over us.

08:17.581 --> 08:18.747
BP and heart rate first.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.374
Get him out of the jacket
and onto the monitor, please.

08:20.625 --> 08:23.210
We only have a tiny window.
l really don't want to be cleaning up urine.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.962
l asked nicely. Do it now.

08:26.882 --> 08:27.923
Fine.

08:29.885 --> 08:31.343
Oh, that's beautiful.

08:31.553 --> 08:32.636
You two, out.

08:36.391 --> 08:38.225
-You did that on purpose.
-You wanted him out of the jacket.

08:38.310 --> 08:39.351
l did what you told me to do.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.020
-You're being insubordinate.
-How?

08:41.396 --> 08:42.938
You want to fire me? Go ahead.
Nobody's looking.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.523
No, l made a promise to my kid.

08:44.608 --> 08:46.734
Besides, l don't need to fire you.
You're a drug addict.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.611
l live with one, remember?

08:48.737 --> 08:50.821
Only a matter of time before
you fuck up again. l'm in no rush.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.740
Neither am l.

08:53.074 --> 08:55.451
Get his vitals, finish the catheter,
hang a banana bag

08:55.577 --> 08:56.994
and put him out in the hall.

08:57.078 --> 08:58.579
We're out of bays.

09:00.624 --> 09:04.084
Someone call housekeeping.
Get the feathers out of trauma.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.594
Oh, my God, it looks like Narnia.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.432
(LAUGHS)

09:19.643 --> 09:22.019
-He's not done.
-Well, he can't fire anybody else.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.562
Look at this place.

09:25.023 --> 09:27.858
-You all right?
-My lower back's a disaster.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.985
l can't get comfortable.

09:31.947 --> 09:34.573
(GROANS) And l hate complaining.

09:34.658 --> 09:36.617
l've waited all my life to have this baby.

09:37.369 --> 09:40.037
Yes, which is why he must be born.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.330

Her first migraine.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.546
Ah. Hello, Tosha.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.674
Can you tell me how you're feeling?

09:51.841 --> 09:53.050
Awful.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.052
People get these all the time?

09:55.428 --> 09:58.472
l can barely keep my eyes open. l'm sorry.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.850
lt's all right. Any other discomfort?

10:01.935 --> 10:02.935
No, it's just...

10:03.436 --> 10:06.897
lt's like now l have a headache
that goes from here to the back of my neck.

10:07.732 --> 10:08.774
You a smoker?

10:08.858 --> 10:11.402
Yeah. Off and on.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.946
Then my mom got sick, so, you know,

10:14.030 --> 10:16.365
l got back together
with my Parliaments for comfort.

10:16.491 --> 10:17.658
How's your mom?

10:19.119 --> 10:20.411
She died last week.

10:20.662 --> 10:21.662
Oh, l'm sorry.

10:21.746 --> 10:24.915
So, you know, she's all right, but l'm a mess.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.626
Stress can trigger migraines quite easily.

10:27.711 --> 10:29.336
That's what l thought.

10:30.422 --> 10:31.922
Fuck.

10:32.007 --> 10:33.340
Are they always this bad?

10:34.134 --> 10:35.301
BP is high.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.011
Um,

10:37.470 --> 10:38.595
CT just to be safe.

10:41.266 --> 10:42.683
(WHlSPERS) l'm gonna have a sit-down.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.144
Go. l got it. Okay.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.691
What are you doing in my office, Coop?

10:51.192 --> 10:53.360
(SlGHS) l've been pretty on board
with all your changes,

10:53.445 --> 10:55.362
but this one, this one's a misfire.

10:55.530 --> 10:57.114
You know l'm not discussing this
with you, right?

10:57.198 --> 10:59.575
l know, but if we were copilots
and you fired this shot, l'd be like,

10:59.659 --> 11:01.618
"Whoa, that's not a bogey.
That's one of ours, man.

11:01.703 --> 11:02.995
"Stop shooting, Goose."

11:03.663 --> 11:05.497
Right, and then l would say,

11:05.582 --> 11:07.291
"Keep your eye on the sky
while l run the guns."

11:07.375 --> 11:08.375
l know what l'm doing here.

11:08.877 --> 11:09.960
They're good people.

11:10.045 --> 11:11.337
No one said they're not.

11:11.463 --> 11:13.130
Look, l've got to get down to the pharmacy.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.299
l'm installing a Pill-O-Matix
while we get our act together.

11:15.383 --> 11:16.717
That's not gonna go over well.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.802
Look, l don't have time for feelings today.

11:18.887 --> 11:20.971
That robot takes over the pharmacy
in an hour,

11:21.056 --> 11:23.057
and then l'm putting in some face time
with the Quantum Bay guys.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.516
That's how it is.

11:27.645 --> 11:28.812
Requesting a flyby?

11:29.022 --> 11:30.105
-Request denied.
-Move.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.625
What?

11:49.709 --> 11:52.544
Are you going to do anything?
lt's like the ship is sinking here and...

11:52.629 --> 11:54.421
-Nope.
-Really?

11:55.090 --> 11:58.092
Because l told everyone that
you were definitely going to do something.

11:59.969 --> 12:03.722
You know what l'm going to do?
l am going to keep working.

12:09.604 --> 12:11.480
l'm gonna wait for it.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.824
What's up, God?

12:22.409 --> 12:24.159
l hope you have a permit for this.

12:24.369 --> 12:25.953
This is New York City, man.

12:26.037 --> 12:27.996
Everything you see belongs to me.

12:28.164 --> 12:31.083
l don't know why l asked you that.
l don't work here anymore.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.339
Not my favorite, but it's nice.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.465
Hey, don't look yet.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.301
l was gonna put you in the back of the boat,

12:41.386 --> 12:42.719
but now l'm putting you up front.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.096
Thanks, man.

-(CLlNKS)
-Oh!

12:45.974 --> 12:47.808
-Hey!
-What is that?

12:47.976 --> 12:49.226
A nail.

12:49.310 --> 12:52.187
Construction site on the roof.
Helipad. l'd forgotten.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.315
You know what? Nails fall from the sky,
don't look up.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.109
Come on, let's go. HR.

12:58.319 --> 12:59.695
Be careful, God.

13:03.283 --> 13:06.118
-Can l get you anything?
-No, l'm all right.

13:07.412 --> 13:08.954
Don't run. Are you crazy?

13:09.164 --> 13:10.456
l'm scurrying.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.749
Tosha, we've got to get you upstairs.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.460
You have a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

13:14.836 --> 13:15.836
l don't want to alarm you,

13:15.920 --> 13:17.880
but l'd like to move you faster
than the hemorrhage.

13:18.339 --> 13:21.550
Are you sure it's not a migraine?
lt's been a terrible week.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.260
Yes, well, l promise you
the week will get worse

13:23.344 --> 13:24.970
unless we get you upstairs immediately.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.263

l'll be quick.

13:37.859 --> 13:39.193
Go ahead. Take the call.

13:39.402 --> 13:40.611
Hi, Daddy.

13:40.904 --> 13:43.155
-Wait, slow down.
-She just lost her mom.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.115
Her dad's on the phone.
She's going into surgery.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.450
Nobody's trying to piss you off.

13:48.411 --> 13:50.746
lf she needs anything, let me know.

-What?
-Just, Dad... Dad...

-Can you take this out? l have to leave.
-No, you can't leave.

14:02.383 --> 14:05.260
No, he fell on a walk
and he didn't even call me.

14:05.428 --> 14:08.096
Now he's at Bellevue and he wants me
to pick him up and take him home.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.389
Can you have someone take me over there?

14:09.516 --> 14:10.724
You are being admitted for surgery.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.309
No, it's just 1 0 blocks away.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.602
There's nobody else who can get him?

14:13.686 --> 14:15.187
No, he can't be by himself.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.105
They were married for 40 years

14:17.357 --> 14:20.234
and now he's all alone in a hospital.
l can't... l can't...

14:20.360 --> 14:21.860
All right, let me see what l can do.

14:24.072 --> 14:25.072
(CLEARS THROAT)

14:25.532 --> 14:28.492
Her dad just got released from Bellevue.
There is no one to pick him up.

14:28.576 --> 14:29.826
Can we send somebody over?

14:30.328 --> 14:31.495
We're not social services.

14:31.579 --> 14:32.621
She's going up to surgery.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.331
You asked me to tell you
if she needed anything.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.291
Look, she's your patient, not her father.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.336
You're either on the floor or you're gone.
Take your pick.

14:40.004 --> 14:41.255
Never mind.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.343
They just took her up.
Her dad's name is Morris.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.971
She gave me her phone, so l have a picture.

14:50.098 --> 14:51.473
l can't leave.

14:54.269 --> 14:57.020
No, don't look at me

14:57.105 --> 14:58.730
You know what he looks like.
You know where he is.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.941
You want things to be different,
you handle it.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.194
Like you're me.

15:12.787 --> 15:14.246
l think l was too honest.

15:14.622 --> 15:17.457
See? And l think l wasn't honest enough.

15:17.959 --> 15:20.460
These Quantum Bay guys,
they know what they're doing.

15:20.878 --> 15:22.963
l've never seen a cute girl in HR.

l'm at my exit interview,

15:25.008 --> 15:27.467
l'm talking to Jessica fucking Rabbit.

You know,
you haven't told me the name of the baby.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.221
l know.

16:54.889 --> 16:58.684
l'm worried that if l do and you love it,
then l shall start to hate it.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.394
What if l keep my face neutral?

17:08.277 --> 17:10.070
Oh, my God!
Who went to Camp Tonka Bear?

17:10.154 --> 17:12.072
l went there. What cabin is this?

17:12.156 --> 17:15.283
l loved this place.
Lake Minnewasha and all the canoes.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.451
What year is this? Maybe l know.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.705
No! l don't want to know
if you know someone there.

17:19.789 --> 17:21.164
-lt's anonymous.
-No, it's not.

So who am l supposed to talk to

17:53.281 --> 17:55.157
about getting half a dozen temp nurses
in here to help out?

17:55.783 --> 17:56.950
We're not there yet.

Look around. We've been there for an hour.

Mike Cruz.

18:02.081 --> 18:04.040
We got to shut down the roof.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.042
There's a reason
this place never had a helipad.

18:06.127 --> 18:08.295
What's the problem?
l mean, besides your hand.

18:08.504 --> 18:11.465
This isn't that bad, but we're getting
surges up there left and right.

Nail gun goes off, no one's holding it.
Look, the wiring is a mess.

18:17.388 --> 18:18.972
The electrical is probably from the 1 800s.

18:19.056 --> 18:20.807
Not true. Everything passed inspection.

18:21.142 --> 18:23.685
l'm so sorry about the hallway.
There are no bays.

18:24.145 --> 18:26.897
We're going to get an X-ray,
make sure it didn't pierce the bone.

Oh, honey, l'm so sorry.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.710
lt was a meticulous search.

6-foot-tall, green eyes, athletic.

20:58.466 --> 20:59.966
Fantastic essay.

21:01.469 --> 21:03.136
He went to the same camp as Coop.

21:03.846 --> 21:05.221
Okay, so who are we talking about?

21:05.306 --> 21:06.389
My donor.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.350
Coop went to my donor's camp.

21:08.809 --> 21:10.644
He knows a song about gleaming lakes.

21:12.146 --> 21:13.563
-That's not so bad.
-Of course it is.

21:13.648 --> 21:15.982
l went to enormous lengths
not to know who the donor is.

21:16.067 --> 21:17.901
And now he went to the same camp, Jackie.

21:17.985 --> 21:19.527
Well, was he there at the same time?

21:19.987 --> 21:21.154
No.

21:22.573 --> 21:24.449
But what if he connects the dots?

21:24.617 --> 21:27.243
Oh, please. He's got much better things
to do with his time than...

21:27.328 --> 21:30.664
l need to be in charge of my own dots.

21:31.707 --> 21:33.500
(SOBS) And l feel fat.

21:34.460 --> 21:35.710
And my back hurts.

21:35.795 --> 21:40.256
And l just want to be
holding my baby on the outside.

21:45.012 --> 21:47.180
See, this is exactly
what l wanted to talk to you about.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.849
Hey, Jackie. l'm tired of being depressed.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.977
-So l was thinking.
-What is that?

21:52.395 --> 21:54.688
-A bag of candles, but l changed my mind.
-Oh, God.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.690
l was thinking
we could do a candlelight vigil,

21:56.774 --> 21:58.650
kind of get everyone together.
But then you see it on the news

21:58.734 --> 22:00.110
and it's so depressing.

22:00.486 --> 22:04.531
So then l thought, lemons into lemonade.
Drum roll, please.

-Baby shower.
-No.

22:12.206 --> 22:13.331

Don't encourage him.

22:14.542 --> 22:16.084
We get everyone together,
you open up presents.

22:16.168 --> 22:20.463
Little baby outfits. Tiny baby pants.
They'll cheer people up.

22:20.548 --> 22:22.132
How can you not smile at tiny baby pants?

22:23.009 --> 22:25.552
Anyway, think about it.
l've got to get back out there.

22:28.097 --> 22:29.264

22:30.558 --> 22:32.809

22:33.144 --> 22:35.145

22:39.775 --> 22:42.068

-Pretty damn good.

22:53.497 --> 22:54.748
What the hell's going on?

22:54.874 --> 22:56.958
Oh, no.

22:58.294 --> 23:01.880
Don't worry. He's not from our hospital.
He's from another hospital.

23:01.964 --> 23:03.715
-What?
-They released him.

23:04.300 --> 23:05.675
l just met him on the street.

23:05.760 --> 23:08.136
Yeah, you tried pushing one of these?
lt's insane.

23:08.888 --> 23:09.929
So where are we going?

23:12.141 --> 23:14.434
Hit the road, dress shirt.
You don't want to see this.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.946
Oh, Jesus. Are we getting anybody upstairs?

23:27.031 --> 23:28.281
l've got to go eat. Five minutes.

23:28.365 --> 23:31.076
Three, please.
l know, we've got to try to clear that hallway.

23:31.619 --> 23:33.953
lt's like l'm hosting
the worst cocktail party ever.

23:34.038 --> 23:35.455
Who wants juice?

23:38.000 --> 23:40.043
You sent her to another hospital

23:40.127 --> 23:41.669
to pick up a patient
and then push him in the street?

23:41.754 --> 23:43.922
That wasn't the plan.
l didn't even have a plan.

23:44.006 --> 23:46.674
Zoey, stop talking.
Look, what is she supposed to do?

23:46.759 --> 23:48.468
Leave the guy on the curb?
He just lost his wife.

23:48.552 --> 23:52.680
His daughter's going up for brain surgery.
Please, please let her do herjob.

23:52.765 --> 23:57.102
Hey, look, if the last 24 hours
have demonstrated anything,

23:57.186 --> 23:59.562
l think it would be
that l'm not afraid to cut you loose.

23:59.647 --> 24:01.064
That goes for all of you.

24:01.607 --> 24:02.899
Mutiny at your own risk.

24:02.983 --> 24:05.068
Are you okay? You're wheezing.

24:05.152 --> 24:06.152
lt's a panic attack.

24:06.320 --> 24:11.950
lt's asthma. l want a chair, a nebulizer,
and some levalbuterol now.

24:13.077 --> 24:14.869
l'm gonna sit right here,
and keep my eye on all of you.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.329
THOR: l'll get it.

24:17.998 --> 24:19.082
(GASPS)

24:19.166 --> 24:20.959
Don't fucking help me.

24:22.503 --> 24:23.711
(WHEEZlNG)

24:32.888 --> 24:35.140
Okay, l know you've been waiting
a long time, everybody.

24:35.224 --> 24:37.433
l'm sorry. We will get to everybody.

24:37.518 --> 24:39.686
You know what? l don't want to talk to you.

24:39.770 --> 24:41.354
l want to talk to your boss.

24:42.022 --> 24:43.857
Actually, you can.
He's sitting right back here.

24:43.941 --> 24:45.733
Bay Number 5. His name is Mike.

24:47.194 --> 24:49.487
What the fuck? Why'd she get to go inside?

24:49.572 --> 24:50.864
She wanted to talk to my boss.

24:50.948 --> 24:53.366
l've been here for six hours.
l'll fucking talk to your boss.

24:53.534 --> 24:55.160
Okay, be my guest, sir.
His name is Mike Cruz.

24:55.244 --> 24:56.870
He's the guy
trying to catch his breath down here,

24:56.954 --> 24:58.705
Bay Number 5. Make a left.

24:59.540 --> 25:00.790
Anybody else?

25:03.836 --> 25:05.128
l understand your frustration.

25:05.212 --> 25:07.255
Look at you, sitting there,
getting some relief.

25:07.339 --> 25:08.423
Must be nice.

25:08.549 --> 25:10.967
Peyton, a little help over here.

25:11.051 --> 25:12.051
You don't need my help.

25:12.261 --> 25:15.388
Look, l need you all to wait
in the other room, please.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.057
We'll wait right here.
Keep breathing, asshole.

25:19.185 --> 25:20.268
You want him there?

25:20.352 --> 25:21.561
l want him gone.

25:23.981 --> 25:25.398
How's the pulse ox?

25:25.524 --> 25:27.442
lt's 95, give or take.

25:27.985 --> 25:29.736
We've got to get you up to pulmonary.
You know l'm right.

25:29.904 --> 25:31.821
Look, l'm feeling light-headed.

25:32.489 --> 25:34.324
l don't want to be wheeled out of here.

25:34.575 --> 25:35.742
(WHEEZES)

25:35.868 --> 25:39.120
Thor! Will you escort Dr. Cruz
up to pulmonary?

25:39.205 --> 25:40.330
And if he faints, will you please carry him?

25:40.873 --> 25:41.956
You know l will.

25:43.125 --> 25:44.417
Get out of here.

25:47.755 --> 25:49.923
See? You like me.

25:53.135 --> 25:54.594
Bays are full. Let's start doubling up.

25:54.678 --> 25:56.137
Let's get some of these gurneys
out of the hallway.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.181
Also, no more pillows
and we're almost out of bedding.

25:58.265 --> 25:59.474
Called housekeeping twice.

25:59.558 --> 26:00.850
Let's just keep moving.

26:00.935 --> 26:02.936
Don't you die on me, man. Not today.

26:03.312 --> 26:04.896
SAM: l'm trying to confirm coverage here.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.648
All right. Give it five seconds, then bail.

26:06.732 --> 26:09.067
-Five, four, three, two, one. You tried.
-Dude!

26:09.193 --> 26:10.276
Go around. See who needs what.

26:11.779 --> 26:13.863
-Where the hell did you go?
-Cruz, pulmonary.

26:14.198 --> 26:15.907
FYl, heart rate through the roof.

26:16.242 --> 26:17.450
(GROANS)

26:17.743 --> 26:19.494
Christ, they're loud.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.080
People on gurneys are admits.
Didn't anyone call upstairs?

26:22.206 --> 26:23.456
Nobody's answering the phone.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.792
Fine. We'll take them up ourselves.

26:26.335 --> 26:27.961
l'm out of here in 1 5.

26:28.128 --> 26:29.963
The hell you are. Start moving gurneys.

26:30.339 --> 26:33.007
-What do you need?
-You can jump in. l mean it, he's not here.

26:33.092 --> 26:34.342
Someone in that corner threw up.

26:34.718 --> 26:36.302
-Thor.
-On it.

26:36.762 --> 26:40.306
Excuse me. l've been here since 3:00.
When am l gonna see a doctor?

26:40.683 --> 26:41.683
What?

26:41.767 --> 26:44.310
My girlfriend has been waiting
for her test results for six hours.

26:44.853 --> 26:46.813
Mmm-hmm, l'm gonna stand here
until you get them.

26:48.023 --> 26:50.191
l don't have a job, so l can do it all day.

26:50.276 --> 26:53.569
Sir, stop staring at me.
We're working as fast as we can.

26:53.654 --> 26:56.155
No, we're not.
lt's nowhere near as fast as we can.

26:56.282 --> 26:59.200
Gloria, what do you say we show them
how we used to do this?

27:01.495 --> 27:03.579
-Some of those were mine.
-They were not.

27:03.664 --> 27:07.250
The patients are yours, the charts are not.
Take care of the patients.

27:07.334 --> 27:09.585
Start by calling the agency.
l want six nurses,

27:09.670 --> 27:10.962
one in admitting, five on the floor.

27:11.088 --> 27:12.338
Cruz won't authorize that.

27:12.423 --> 27:13.631
Just do it. l will take the hit.

27:13.757 --> 27:15.591
-Really? Six?
-You know what? Seven.

27:15.676 --> 27:17.510
Make it seven.
Let's give these bastards some relief.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.387
Who the fuck is in charge of this place?

27:19.722 --> 27:20.972
l am.

27:24.226 --> 27:25.476
l'm in charge.
