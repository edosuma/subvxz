00:38.070 --> 00:40.872
since the late 1880s, visual

00:41.006 --> 00:43.241
artists and storytellers have

00:43.375 --> 00:45.243
used moving images to create

00:45.377 --> 00:46.444
amazing works.

00:46.578 --> 00:47.912
you ain't heard nothing yet.

00:49.448 --> 00:51.115
movies have inspired us...

00:51.250 --> 00:52.283
i have something more than

00:52.418 --> 00:53.251
a hope.

00:53.385 --> 00:55.219
thrilled us, and captured our

00:55.354 --> 00:57.655
imaginations.

00:57.790 --> 00:59.590
film has helped us share our

00:59.725 --> 01:02.894
experiences and dreams.

01:04.863 --> 01:06.464
photochemical film has been the

01:06.598 --> 01:08.299
exclusive format used to

01:08.434 --> 01:11.069
capture, develop, project, and

01:11.203 --> 01:13.805
store moving images for over 100

01:13.939 --> 01:14.906
years.

01:21.046 --> 01:22.413
it is only recently that

01:22.548 --> 01:24.082
a new technology has emerged

01:24.216 --> 01:25.950
that is challenging film's place

01:26.085 --> 01:28.152
as the gold standard for quality

01:28.287 --> 01:29.153
and work flow.

01:30.255 --> 01:32.023
digital technology is evolving

01:32.157 --> 01:33.724
to a point that may very well

01:33.859 --> 01:35.526
replace film as the primary

01:35.661 --> 01:38.062
means of creating and sharing

01:38.197 --> 01:39.964
motion pictures.

01:40.099 --> 01:41.299
the documentary we're doing is

01:41.433 --> 01:43.501
called side by side, and it's a

01:43.635 --> 01:45.203
documentary about the science,

01:45.337 --> 01:47.138
art, and impact of digital

01:47.272 --> 01:47.839
cinema.

01:47.973 --> 01:50.174
100 years of photochemical

01:50.309 --> 01:53.311
filmmaking right now has reached

01:53.445 --> 01:54.779
a kind of threshold tipping

01:54.913 --> 01:56.581
point.

01:56.715 --> 01:58.282
in this conversation, in this

01:58.417 --> 02:01.185
kind of intersection of time,

02:01.320 --> 02:02.220
it's historic.

02:02.354 --> 02:03.855
we've kind of come to this place

02:03.989 --> 02:08.258
where- is it the end of film?

02:08.393 --> 02:10.761
where are we today?

02:10.895 --> 02:12.296
it's exciting because it's

02:12.431 --> 02:16.234
a reinvention of a new medium.

02:16.368 --> 02:18.669
if the photochemical process has

02:18.804 --> 02:19.971
worked its way through our

02:20.105 --> 02:22.340
culture, we're on to another

02:22.474 --> 02:23.141
level.

02:24.209 --> 02:24.942
and how do you use it to tell

02:25.077 --> 02:25.643
a story?

02:25.777 --> 02:27.011
how do you use it to paint

02:27.146 --> 02:29.447
a picture?

02:29.581 --> 02:31.382
are you done with film?

02:31.517 --> 02:33.217
don't hold me to it, keanu,

02:33.352 --> 02:36.154
but i think i am.

02:37.556 --> 02:39.991
digital cameras are the new

02:40.125 --> 02:42.126
aesthetic that's coming to

02:42.261 --> 02:44.128
cinema, and at the same time,

02:44.263 --> 02:47.198
we're going to mourn the loss of

02:47.332 --> 02:49.267
film.

02:49.401 --> 02:50.568
i am constantly asked to

02:50.702 --> 02:52.036
justify why i want to shoot

02:52.171 --> 02:54.772
a film on film, but i don't hear

02:54.907 --> 02:56.674
anybody being asked to justify

02:56.808 --> 02:58.543
why they want to shoot a film

02:58.677 --> 03:00.144
digitally.

03:00.279 --> 03:01.579
i wanted whatever i could

03:01.713 --> 03:03.014
imagine to be something that we

03:03.148 --> 03:04.515
could realize.

03:04.650 --> 03:06.417
i saw the door opening on a

03:06.552 --> 03:07.818
field of possibilities that you

03:07.953 --> 03:09.921
just couldn't do with film.

03:10.055 --> 03:13.024
it's really sad right now to

03:13.158 --> 03:15.660
see cameras recording imagery in

03:15.794 --> 03:19.197
an inferior way starting to take

03:19.331 --> 03:20.765
over film.

03:20.899 --> 03:22.934
i'm not gonna trade my oil

03:23.068 --> 03:25.136
paints for a set of crayons.

03:27.940 --> 03:29.941
there will be people who will

03:30.075 --> 03:31.242
cheapen digital.

03:31.376 --> 03:32.877
there are people who will not

03:33.011 --> 03:34.645
only kill the goose that laid

03:34.780 --> 03:36.847
the golden egg but they'll

03:36.982 --> 03:38.683
sodomize it first.

03:38.817 --> 03:39.817
if the intention is that

03:39.952 --> 03:41.252
digital is gonna replace film,

03:41.386 --> 03:42.353
i would be sad if it didn't

03:42.487 --> 03:45.590
actually exactly replicate it.

03:48.493 --> 03:50.361
they process digital now to

03:50.495 --> 03:51.696
make it look like film, as if

03:51.830 --> 03:53.097
film is inherently better.

03:53.232 --> 03:54.599
just- we like the way it looks

03:54.733 --> 03:55.833
better, which seems kind of

03:55.968 --> 03:56.534
arbitrary.

03:56.668 --> 03:58.936
it's just what we're used to.

03:59.071 --> 04:00.605
film is a 19th century

04:00.739 --> 04:01.672
invention.

04:01.807 --> 04:02.974
we are at the top of the

04:03.108 --> 04:04.041
photochemical process.

04:04.176 --> 04:04.976
this is about as far as it's

04:05.110 --> 04:06.210
ever gonna go.

04:06.345 --> 04:08.546
digital is here now, but it's

04:08.680 --> 04:10.548
gonna keep going, and you got to

04:10.682 --> 04:11.215
be a part of that.

04:11.350 --> 04:12.183
who's gonna be a part of that,

04:12.317 --> 04:13.951
dictating where that goes?

04:14.086 --> 04:14.819
i don't think film's going

04:14.953 --> 04:15.486
anywhere.

04:15.621 --> 04:17.255
i don't think it's to the

04:17.389 --> 04:19.322
advantage of anybody to totally

04:19.458 --> 04:20.257
eliminate film.

04:20.392 --> 04:21.291
there are gonna be many of us

04:21.426 --> 04:22.393
that are gonna fight for film,

04:22.527 --> 04:23.227
that are gonna fight for the

04:23.362 --> 04:24.161
experience of shooting on

04:24.296 --> 04:26.564
emulsion.

04:26.698 --> 04:27.965
we really are in the midst of

04:28.100 --> 04:30.835
some sort of revolution that

04:30.969 --> 04:33.137
threatens the status quo.

04:33.272 --> 04:35.339
this is a potentially either

04:35.474 --> 04:37.308
scary thing or a very liberating

04:37.442 --> 04:38.042
thing.

04:52.190 --> 04:53.391
one of the first steps in the

04:53.525 --> 04:55.526
production process is capturing

04:55.661 --> 04:58.796
the images in camera.

04:58.930 --> 05:00.598
the director, actors,

05:00.732 --> 05:02.400
cinematographer, and the entire

05:02.534 --> 05:04.135
production team work together to

05:04.269 --> 05:06.971
bring the script to life.

05:07.105 --> 05:09.073
the cinematographer, also called

05:09.207 --> 05:10.675
the director of photography or

05:10.809 --> 05:13.344
dp, helps the director achieve

05:13.478 --> 05:15.713
the look of the movie.

05:15.847 --> 05:17.248
the dp is responsible for

05:17.382 --> 05:19.383
knowing what equipment is needed

05:19.518 --> 05:20.518
and how it works in order to

05:20.652 --> 05:22.753
capture the scenes.

05:22.888 --> 05:24.021
now take your big bolge

05:24.156 --> 05:25.923
camera off, please.

05:26.058 --> 05:26.590
there.

05:26.725 --> 05:27.692
action.

05:27.826 --> 05:29.593
a director of photography

05:29.728 --> 05:32.129
looks at color and composition

05:32.264 --> 05:33.597
and angles and all of these

05:33.732 --> 05:36.567
things in terms of how the movie

05:36.702 --> 05:37.868
is being built.

05:38.003 --> 05:39.270
the quality of light off skin,

05:39.404 --> 05:40.371
the quality of light through

05:40.505 --> 05:41.872
hair, the quality of light

05:42.007 --> 05:42.907
through the window or bouncing

05:43.041 --> 05:44.608
off the floor.

05:44.743 --> 05:47.211
they're equating the building of

05:47.346 --> 05:51.415
this world in terms of energy

05:51.550 --> 05:53.784
that reflects off of objects.

05:53.919 --> 05:57.254
the question is about

05:57.389 --> 06:00.224
framing, sensibility, how to

06:00.359 --> 06:01.158
make people feel.

06:01.293 --> 06:02.893
bringing emotion into the

06:03.028 --> 06:05.596
light comes from being

06:05.731 --> 06:06.764
appropriate and being- somehow

06:06.898 --> 06:07.932
being- you know, the great ones

06:08.066 --> 06:08.766
are more than appropriate.

06:08.900 --> 06:10.501
they really startle you with how

06:10.635 --> 06:12.436
wonderfully evocative this look

06:12.571 --> 06:15.172
is of whatever they're doing.

06:15.307 --> 06:16.674
that level of craftsmanship

06:16.808 --> 06:18.976
or, you know, if you will, that

06:19.111 --> 06:20.144
technical expertise- 

06:20.278 --> 06:21.011
you can't explain what you're

06:21.146 --> 06:22.947
gonna do, so there is a certain

06:23.081 --> 06:23.948
amount of a leap of faith that

06:24.082 --> 06:26.016
they have to have in you.

06:28.186 --> 06:30.488
to be a cinematographer is to

06:30.622 --> 06:33.624
have the knowledge of the art.

06:33.759 --> 06:36.227
without any doubt, cinema today

06:36.361 --> 06:38.596
is a mixing of art and

06:38.730 --> 06:40.131
technology.

06:40.265 --> 06:41.732
today in this era, you also

06:41.867 --> 06:42.800
have to be a bit of a

06:42.934 --> 06:44.201
technician and you have to know

06:44.336 --> 06:44.869
the equipment.

06:45.003 --> 06:46.604
and it's really important for

06:46.738 --> 06:49.473
dps to understand the entire

06:49.608 --> 06:52.042
link of the image chain from

06:52.177 --> 06:55.312
acquisition to exhibition.

06:59.017 --> 07:00.951
ready to go in five and...

07:02.687 --> 07:04.889
on five, please.

07:05.023 --> 07:06.891
and action.

07:07.025 --> 07:08.225
the camera is a tool that

07:08.360 --> 07:09.960
focuses and measures photons of

07:10.095 --> 07:11.462
light and records them as

07:11.596 --> 07:13.831
images.

07:13.965 --> 07:16.000
with a film camera, light enters

07:16.134 --> 07:17.368
through the lens and hits a

07:17.502 --> 07:21.505
frame of film behind the lens.

07:21.640 --> 07:22.673
the film is covered with

07:22.808 --> 07:24.408
an emulsion that contains grains

07:24.543 --> 07:27.178
of silver halide crystals.

07:27.312 --> 07:28.779
these crystals react chemically

07:28.914 --> 07:30.614
when light hits them, and the

07:30.749 --> 07:32.016
crystals change into silver

07:32.150 --> 07:34.218
metal when they are developed.

07:34.352 --> 07:35.820
a photographic image is formed

07:35.954 --> 07:38.556
on the film.

07:38.690 --> 07:41.358
there is something about the

07:41.493 --> 07:42.860
texture and the grain structure

07:42.994 --> 07:47.298
of film that i've- personally

07:47.432 --> 07:48.799
i hold onto and it's like

07:48.934 --> 07:50.801
a comforting thing to me.

07:50.936 --> 07:54.238
and it feels more tangible.

07:54.372 --> 07:55.539
the halides open up and flip

07:55.674 --> 07:56.740
themselves and give a sort of

07:56.875 --> 07:58.242
textural quality.

07:58.376 --> 07:59.677
you still have some granularity

07:59.811 --> 08:01.378
in the image that keeps

08:01.580 --> 08:02.179
highlights living.

08:02.314 --> 08:03.347
it keeps blacks with

08:03.482 --> 08:04.548
a little bit more nuance

08:04.683 --> 08:05.316
and character in them.

08:05.450 --> 08:07.818
i like grit and grain and

08:07.953 --> 08:08.552
texture.

08:08.687 --> 08:10.187
it gives you a variety of

08:10.322 --> 08:12.256
different opportunities.

08:13.792 --> 08:15.493
the work flow on a film set

08:15.627 --> 08:18.662
basically means that you take

08:18.797 --> 08:20.464
thousand- foot loads of film,

08:20.599 --> 08:22.333
load it into the magazines, and

08:22.467 --> 08:23.834
that enables you to shoot for

08:23.969 --> 08:26.804
roughly ten- plus minutes per

08:26.938 --> 08:27.538
roll of film.

08:27.672 --> 08:28.205
cut.

08:28.340 --> 08:29.206
that's a cut.

08:29.341 --> 08:30.608
camera reload.

08:30.742 --> 08:31.642
and then it gives you

08:31.776 --> 08:33.409
a natural break in the action

08:33.544 --> 08:34.578
while someone pulls the

08:34.712 --> 08:36.947
magazine off the camera and puts

08:37.082 --> 08:39.783
a new magazine on.

08:39.918 --> 08:41.852
then the film goes away to

08:41.986 --> 08:45.723
a film lab and is developed

08:45.857 --> 08:48.826
overnight and printed.

08:56.167 --> 08:57.501
and then the next day, you get

08:57.636 --> 08:59.904
to see dailies.

09:01.673 --> 09:03.073
there was a joy for many,

09:03.208 --> 09:05.442
many years for us to be,

09:05.577 --> 09:08.379
you know, the genies on set.

09:08.513 --> 09:09.213
you know, that's why we love

09:09.347 --> 09:10.180
dailies.

09:10.315 --> 09:11.749
we'd all go, we'd act,

09:11.883 --> 09:13.984
we'd light, we'd do what we do,

09:14.119 --> 09:15.853
we'd love what we did, and then

09:15.987 --> 09:16.987
everybody would wrap, and the

09:17.122 --> 09:18.422
next morning, it'd come back

09:18.557 --> 09:19.557
from the lab and we went,

09:19.691 --> 09:21.292
"wow, look what we got."

09:21.426 --> 09:22.426
you know, it was magic.

09:22.561 --> 09:23.794
the director of photography

09:23.929 --> 09:25.195
was a magician.

09:25.330 --> 09:28.499
he was the only one who actually

09:28.633 --> 09:30.134
probably knew what was gonna be

09:30.268 --> 09:32.603
on the screen next day.

09:32.737 --> 09:33.771
and this gave you a lot of

09:33.905 --> 09:36.040
authority and power.

09:36.174 --> 09:37.641
and there's a certain leap of

09:37.776 --> 09:38.609
faith that you take when you

09:38.743 --> 09:40.077
shoot film, and there's

09:40.211 --> 09:41.312
something really romantic about

09:41.446 --> 09:42.947
that- getting your dailies back

09:43.081 --> 09:44.415
and everyone being really

09:44.549 --> 09:46.083
excited to see what you got.

09:46.217 --> 09:49.486
but i don't like the betrayal

09:49.621 --> 09:50.421
of dailies.

09:50.555 --> 09:52.523
i don't like going in and seeing

09:52.657 --> 09:54.625
and getting, you know, swept up

09:54.759 --> 09:56.961
with a performance and then

09:57.095 --> 09:58.429
seeing it go out of focus on

09:58.563 --> 10:01.899
a 25- foot screen and knowing

10:02.033 --> 10:03.133
that there's no way to retrieve

10:03.268 --> 10:03.801
that.

10:03.935 --> 10:04.735
what i didn't like about film

10:04.869 --> 10:06.770
was that feeling midway through

10:06.905 --> 10:08.238
the day, end of the day:

10:08.373 --> 10:09.206
"did we get anything today?

10:09.341 --> 10:09.873
i don't even remember.

10:10.008 --> 10:10.741
did we get"- 

10:10.875 --> 10:11.542
it didn't feel like we put the

10:11.676 --> 10:12.443
flag in it 'cause you couldn't

10:12.577 --> 10:13.110
see.

10:13.244 --> 10:14.044
it's like painting with the

10:14.179 --> 10:14.712
lights off.

10:14.846 --> 10:16.347
but the dp would tell you,

10:16.481 --> 10:17.348
"it's not- the lights aren't

10:17.482 --> 10:18.015
off.

10:18.149 --> 10:19.383
it's in my head."

10:19.517 --> 10:20.217
it's in his head.

10:20.352 --> 10:21.151
well, that's great,

10:21.286 --> 10:22.186
but i'm operating the camera.

10:22.320 --> 10:23.554
i'm picking the lenses.

10:23.688 --> 10:25.623
i'm judging the performances.

10:27.092 --> 10:28.726
a digital camera does not use

10:28.860 --> 10:29.927
film.

10:30.061 --> 10:32.062
instead, it has an electronic

10:32.197 --> 10:34.098
sensor, or chip, behind the

10:34.232 --> 10:35.499
lens.

10:35.634 --> 10:37.301
the sensor is made up of

10:37.435 --> 10:38.636
millions of tiny picture

10:38.770 --> 10:42.206
elements, or "pixels" for short.

10:42.340 --> 10:43.974
when light enters the camera,

10:44.109 --> 10:45.476
it hits the pixels and creates

10:45.610 --> 10:48.646
individual electronic charges.

10:48.780 --> 10:50.214
these charges are measured and

10:50.348 --> 10:52.149
converted into digital data that

10:52.283 --> 10:55.252
represent the image.

10:55.387 --> 10:56.820
grains of film, they're just

10:56.955 --> 10:58.355
constantly moving, you know?

10:58.490 --> 11:00.391
and so the result is a kind of

11:00.525 --> 11:04.094
fuzziness, whereas with the

11:04.229 --> 11:07.665
pixel count, it's a very finite,

11:07.799 --> 11:10.634
accurate, exact thing.

11:11.469 --> 11:12.703
so we're gonna do one action

11:12.837 --> 11:13.837
for dolly and camera.

11:13.972 --> 11:15.706
i think that worked last time.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.808
and action.

11:17.942 --> 11:19.076
with digital cameras and

11:19.210 --> 11:20.878
monitors, you are able to see

11:21.012 --> 11:22.446
exactly what you are recording

11:22.580 --> 11:24.314
on set as you are shooting.

11:24.449 --> 11:25.783
that's nice.

11:25.917 --> 11:27.785
unlike film cameras, you

11:27.919 --> 11:29.219
don't have to wait a day to see

11:29.354 --> 11:30.754
what you've captured.

11:30.889 --> 11:32.756
they are no longer "dailies."

11:32.891 --> 11:35.159
they are "immediatelies."

11:35.293 --> 11:36.226
you sit round the back

11:36.361 --> 11:37.227
of the set or in a tent

11:37.362 --> 11:38.829
somewhere looking at this huge

11:38.963 --> 11:40.731
monitor and making adjustments

11:40.865 --> 11:41.732
from that, which i actually

11:41.866 --> 11:43.067
quite like, because it means

11:43.201 --> 11:43.967
you're seeing the picture

11:44.102 --> 11:45.069
exactly as it is.

11:45.203 --> 11:47.071
and with the old film capture,

11:47.205 --> 11:48.672
it was overnight, and sometimes

11:48.807 --> 11:49.440
you'd go to bed and think,

11:49.574 --> 11:50.741
"i wonder if i got that right,"

11:50.875 --> 11:51.408
you know?

11:51.543 --> 11:52.409
or you'd say, "i think we

11:52.544 --> 11:53.310
need more backlight," and he'd

11:53.445 --> 11:53.977
say, "don't worry.

11:54.112 --> 11:55.746
it'll look great in dailies."

11:55.880 --> 11:57.047
they know as well as anybody

11:57.182 --> 11:58.015
that you go to dailies and say,

11:58.149 --> 11:59.650
"i really think there should be

11:59.784 --> 12:01.018
more backlight in there."

12:01.152 --> 12:02.519
but if you do it on the set,

12:02.654 --> 12:03.287
you can just stand there and

12:03.421 --> 12:04.621
say, "no, more backlight."

12:04.756 --> 12:05.889
okay, cut.

12:06.024 --> 12:06.623
and they do it.

12:06.758 --> 12:07.558
and i'd say, "okay, now that's

12:07.692 --> 12:08.358
exactly the way i want it

12:08.493 --> 12:09.293
'cause that's exactly the way

12:09.427 --> 12:10.027
it's gonna be in the movie

12:10.161 --> 12:10.794
theater."

12:10.929 --> 12:12.396
people speak about "thank

12:12.530 --> 12:13.230
god, i can see what i'm getting

12:13.364 --> 12:13.931
now.

12:14.065 --> 12:14.998
i don't have to wait until

12:15.133 --> 12:15.833
tomorrow.

12:15.967 --> 12:17.034
i can see if it's in focus.

12:17.168 --> 12:18.168
i know what i'm getting."

12:18.303 --> 12:19.436
if you're watching a monitor

12:19.571 --> 12:21.004
on set and you feel that you're

12:21.139 --> 12:22.706
really seeing what you've got,

12:22.841 --> 12:24.174
i think you're fooling yourself.

12:24.309 --> 12:25.409
the audience is gonna watch that

12:25.543 --> 12:27.377
film on a screen that is, you

12:27.512 --> 12:28.345
know, a thousand times bigger

12:28.480 --> 12:29.012
than that.

12:29.147 --> 12:29.947
you know, you're watching it on

12:30.081 --> 12:32.082
a large tv.

12:32.217 --> 12:32.916
yes, you see what you're

12:33.051 --> 12:33.584
getting.

12:33.718 --> 12:35.753
it's right there.

12:35.887 --> 12:36.520
the problem for me is that

12:36.654 --> 12:37.354
i still think you need to

12:37.489 --> 12:38.856
see rushes later.

12:38.990 --> 12:41.525
i think, in order to concentrate

12:41.659 --> 12:43.660
with the performances or just

12:43.795 --> 12:44.795
the movement, and that's- 

12:44.929 --> 12:45.696
i still think you need to

12:45.830 --> 12:47.798
see them at a special time.

12:47.932 --> 12:50.067
the process of shooting film

12:50.201 --> 12:51.502
was the director of

12:51.636 --> 12:54.004
photography's art and secret.

12:54.139 --> 12:56.206
and today, the cinematographer

12:56.341 --> 12:58.242
is monitored on a digital shoot,

12:58.376 --> 12:59.443
and everything that they're

12:59.577 --> 13:02.246
doing can be seen, criticized,

13:02.380 --> 13:05.382
and questioned.

13:05.517 --> 13:06.483
it's very destructive

13:06.618 --> 13:07.284
sometimes.

13:07.418 --> 13:08.685
i've worked with a couple of

13:08.820 --> 13:11.922
actors that insist on looking at

13:12.056 --> 13:12.956
every take.

13:13.091 --> 13:14.525
with one of the actors, i was

13:14.659 --> 13:15.793
able to talk him out of it

13:15.927 --> 13:16.794
because it was making his

13:16.928 --> 13:17.594
performances very

13:17.729 --> 13:18.262
self- conscious.

13:18.396 --> 13:19.396
right.

13:19.531 --> 13:20.764
i also am convinced that

13:20.899 --> 13:21.832
everybody's just looking at

13:21.966 --> 13:24.134
their hair.

13:24.269 --> 13:26.503
one of the great pleasures of

13:26.638 --> 13:28.939
being a cameraman was that the

13:29.073 --> 13:30.674
people- the suits and the

13:30.809 --> 13:32.075
producers- well, they all think

13:32.210 --> 13:33.043
they know how to act, they all

13:33.178 --> 13:33.877
think they know how to write,

13:34.012 --> 13:34.945
they all think they know how to

13:35.079 --> 13:35.679
direct, but they knew they

13:35.814 --> 13:37.114
didn't know how to shoot.

13:37.248 --> 13:38.882
so if they really got on you,

13:39.017 --> 13:40.017
you could say, "here, here's the

13:40.151 --> 13:41.051
meter; you do it,"

13:41.186 --> 13:42.653
and that would shut them up.

13:42.787 --> 13:44.188
but now, they're beginning to

13:44.322 --> 13:45.422
think they can shoot.

13:45.557 --> 13:46.723
it's not like it used to be.

13:46.858 --> 13:49.159
there are cinematographers

13:49.294 --> 13:51.829
who became cinematographers

13:51.963 --> 13:54.031
because they love the voodoo

13:54.165 --> 13:55.332
of it.

13:55.466 --> 13:56.800
they love it when the director

13:56.935 --> 13:58.101
says to them, "all right, down

13:58.236 --> 13:59.803
in that corner- are we gonna be

13:59.938 --> 14:00.871
able to see that or is that

14:01.005 --> 14:02.506
gonna kind of melt away?"

14:02.640 --> 14:03.507
and they'd get to go,

14:03.641 --> 14:04.541
"just wait until tomorrow.

14:04.676 --> 14:05.309
it's gonna be amazing.

14:05.443 --> 14:05.976
you're gonna love it."

14:06.110 --> 14:07.845
and i've had those experiences.

14:07.979 --> 14:08.912
i've sat in dailies and i've

14:09.047 --> 14:10.981
gone, "oh."

14:11.115 --> 14:11.748
you know, some of darius

14:11.883 --> 14:12.983
khondji's work on se7en, you

14:13.117 --> 14:15.018
would just go, "wow."

14:15.153 --> 14:17.054
but there is an equal amount of

14:17.188 --> 14:20.190
times that you'd go- i would

14:20.325 --> 14:22.593
look at it and say,

14:22.727 --> 14:24.895
"what the fuck?"

14:25.029 --> 14:26.997
now with digital cameras,

14:27.131 --> 14:29.733
everyone could see exactly what

14:29.868 --> 14:31.668
things were going to look like.

14:31.803 --> 14:32.736
that changes the way you light

14:32.871 --> 14:33.570
it.

14:33.705 --> 14:34.972
it may even change your

14:35.106 --> 14:37.140
performance because it creates

14:37.275 --> 14:38.075
a different feeling in the whole

14:38.209 --> 14:38.742
thing.

14:38.877 --> 14:40.510
it gives us more scope to be

14:40.645 --> 14:41.378
creative.

14:41.512 --> 14:42.713
that's what's exciting.

14:42.847 --> 14:44.047
that's, to me, was what the

14:44.182 --> 14:45.449
digital revolution in cameras

14:45.583 --> 14:47.517
is all about.

14:48.453 --> 14:51.188
in 1969, at bell labs in new

14:51.322 --> 14:53.657
jersey, george smith and willard

14:53.791 --> 14:55.425
boyle came up with the idea for

14:55.560 --> 14:57.527
the charged coupled device, and

14:57.662 --> 15:00.964
the first ccd chip was created.

15:01.833 --> 15:02.933
one of the things that makes

15:03.067 --> 15:06.970
the ccd unique is its ability to

15:07.105 --> 15:09.172
perform specialized functions

15:09.307 --> 15:12.142
such as acting as a camera.

15:12.277 --> 15:14.044
the image that you see on the tv

15:14.178 --> 15:16.346
screen of both of us is being

15:16.481 --> 15:18.015
produced by this small ccd

15:18.149 --> 15:19.383
camera, which is directly in

15:19.517 --> 15:20.751
front of us, here.

15:20.885 --> 15:22.953
in the early 1970s after

15:23.087 --> 15:25.489
a visit to bell labs, sony

15:25.623 --> 15:27.124
started investing in and

15:27.258 --> 15:28.558
developing products using the

15:28.693 --> 15:30.861
ccd technology.

15:30.995 --> 15:32.696
the chairman and founder- 

15:32.830 --> 15:33.897
akio morita, who was the

15:34.032 --> 15:35.899
founder of sony- he was always

15:36.034 --> 15:38.235
enamored with hollywood and it

15:38.369 --> 15:40.337
was his dream to design an

15:40.471 --> 15:42.806
electronic camera that could

15:42.941 --> 15:45.008
create images that were the

15:45.143 --> 15:46.343
equivalent, if not better than,

15:46.477 --> 15:47.711
35- millimeter film.

15:47.845 --> 15:49.179
record what you want when you

15:49.314 --> 15:49.913
want, and watch- 

15:50.048 --> 15:52.115
by the mid- 1980s, sony was

15:52.250 --> 15:53.517
producing its first

15:53.651 --> 15:56.787
consumer- quality ccd camcorders.

15:59.057 --> 16:01.291
in the 1990s, small,

16:01.426 --> 16:03.360
standard- definition cameras

16:03.494 --> 16:05.462
began recording digitally.

16:07.565 --> 16:08.198
they were first used

16:08.333 --> 16:09.533
cinematically when they were

16:09.667 --> 16:11.234
embraced by the dogma 95

16:11.369 --> 16:13.770
movement out of denmark.

16:13.905 --> 16:14.905
can you speak a little bit

16:15.039 --> 16:16.907
about- well, where did you first

16:17.041 --> 16:18.642
come into digital- 

16:18.776 --> 16:23.080
actually by chance because we

16:23.214 --> 16:24.381
made this thing called

16:24.515 --> 16:28.318
"dogma 95," and we made some

16:28.453 --> 16:31.054
rules, and one of them was that

16:31.189 --> 16:32.689
the thing has to be filmed in

16:32.824 --> 16:35.993
academy 35 millimeter,

16:36.127 --> 16:37.627
and then one of them said it had

16:37.762 --> 16:40.030
to be a handheld camera also.

16:40.164 --> 16:41.365
and then i said, "but if that

16:41.499 --> 16:42.366
is the case, then we can also

16:42.500 --> 16:44.334
use video."

16:44.469 --> 16:47.304
and that was just at the same

16:47.438 --> 16:48.839
time as these cameras kind of

16:48.973 --> 16:50.073
appeared.

16:50.208 --> 16:51.475
anthony dod mantle was the

16:51.609 --> 16:53.210
dp who shot the first dogma

16:53.344 --> 16:55.746
film, thomas vinterberg's

16:55.880 --> 16:57.514
celebration.

16:57.648 --> 17:00.684
well, was the appeal also of

17:00.818 --> 17:04.354
digital video the lightness of

17:04.489 --> 17:05.955
the camera, the way that you

17:06.089 --> 17:06.623
could move it- 

17:06.758 --> 17:07.656
i'll tell you where that

17:07.791 --> 17:08.392
first hit me.

17:08.526 --> 17:09.492
i was coming home from a foot

17:09.627 --> 17:11.428
match in copenhagen and i had

17:11.561 --> 17:12.963
a sony pc3, which actually

17:13.097 --> 17:14.464
was the camera i ended up

17:14.598 --> 17:16.199
shooting celebration on.

17:16.334 --> 17:19.502
and i remember seeing this crowd

17:19.637 --> 17:22.105
of, like, supporters just moving

17:22.240 --> 17:23.807
across this field with an

17:23.941 --> 17:25.175
industrial backdrop.

17:25.309 --> 17:26.376
it was misty and hazy, and it

17:26.511 --> 17:27.711
was kind of gothic.

17:29.247 --> 17:30.614
i was just learning how to play

17:30.748 --> 17:31.415
with it, and i just whipped it

17:31.549 --> 17:33.116
around, and then i got this

17:33.251 --> 17:36.086
weird moment of immediacy- 

17:36.220 --> 17:38.522
of lightness and immediacy.

17:38.656 --> 17:39.322
and i looked at the image, and

17:39.457 --> 17:40.657
i thought, "my god, the amazing

17:40.792 --> 17:42.492
thing about this camera is,

17:42.627 --> 17:44.561
i caught that.

17:47.432 --> 17:48.265
two months later, i'm shooting

17:48.399 --> 17:49.800
celebration on these small

17:49.934 --> 17:51.034
cameras 'cause i wanted to be

17:51.169 --> 17:51.768
a protagonist in the

17:51.903 --> 17:52.602
celebration.

17:55.540 --> 17:56.106
hi, pa.

17:56.240 --> 17:56.807
the combination of the

17:56.941 --> 17:57.641
movement and the activity and

17:57.775 --> 17:59.009
the emotion- the emotional

17:59.143 --> 18:00.177
movement of that camera would

18:00.311 --> 18:02.846
probably define that film's

18:02.980 --> 18:04.247
visual language, apart from the

18:04.382 --> 18:05.916
actors and the writing and the

18:06.050 --> 18:06.783
great script.

18:14.358 --> 18:15.492
with that camera, i suddenly

18:15.626 --> 18:17.427
saw these moves, these possible

18:17.562 --> 18:18.829
movements that i didn't know in

18:18.963 --> 18:20.897
my cinema...

18:21.632 --> 18:23.133
and that became my donation

18:23.267 --> 18:24.201
to the celebration.

18:24.335 --> 18:26.470
what celebration meant and

18:26.604 --> 18:28.505
what a lot of the other films of

18:28.639 --> 18:30.507
that era meant was that you just

18:30.641 --> 18:32.742
had to completely rethink the

18:32.877 --> 18:35.212
technical side of filmmaking.

18:35.346 --> 18:37.614
it brought people to filmmaking

18:37.748 --> 18:38.815
for creativity's sake.

18:41.919 --> 18:43.186
it pointed out that the

18:43.321 --> 18:45.055
mechanism of filmmaking only

18:45.189 --> 18:46.523
serves the creative.

18:48.526 --> 18:49.059
i'll get it.

18:49.193 --> 18:49.793
you want me to get it?

18:49.927 --> 18:52.262
no, i got it.

18:52.396 --> 18:55.098
with dv came this whole idea

18:55.233 --> 18:57.067
of, "well, wait a second.

18:57.201 --> 19:00.103
if we lower our budgets, we get

19:00.238 --> 19:02.939
more freedom as directors and

19:03.074 --> 19:04.040
as producers.

19:04.175 --> 19:05.342
shooting a film on video at

19:05.476 --> 19:07.911
that point meant it was crap.

19:08.045 --> 19:11.181
it was almost, you know, an

19:11.315 --> 19:13.550
accepted truth that you didn't

19:13.684 --> 19:14.818
shoot films that you were

19:14.952 --> 19:17.754
serious about on any kind of

19:17.889 --> 19:18.722
video format.

19:18.856 --> 19:20.357
we just started going out

19:20.491 --> 19:21.158
there, and we were saying,

19:21.292 --> 19:22.826
"look, we're gonna make movies

19:22.960 --> 19:23.493
digitally.

19:23.628 --> 19:24.861
we're gonna give directors final

19:24.996 --> 19:28.031
cut- total creative control- 

19:28.166 --> 19:29.132
but we'll make them cheaper."

19:29.267 --> 19:30.767
and our very first movie was

19:30.902 --> 19:31.535
chuck and buck.

19:31.669 --> 19:32.969
hey, buck.

19:33.104 --> 19:36.206
oh, hi.

19:36.340 --> 19:37.174
can i get you something to

19:37.308 --> 19:38.275
drink?

19:38.409 --> 19:40.677
oh, no, that's all right.

19:40.811 --> 19:42.078
looking at rushes, it was

19:42.213 --> 19:43.213
scary as hell.

19:43.347 --> 19:44.047
would you like some

19:44.182 --> 19:45.248
ice cream?

19:45.383 --> 19:45.916
really?

19:46.050 --> 19:47.684
oh, mmm.

19:47.818 --> 19:48.685
i like ice cream.

19:48.819 --> 19:50.086
we were, like, "my god, this

19:50.221 --> 19:51.354
looks so amateurish."

19:51.489 --> 19:54.991
a lot of people actually

19:55.126 --> 19:56.393
commented on how muddled it

19:56.527 --> 19:57.427
looked.

19:57.562 --> 19:58.895
i think we're fuckin' doomed,

19:59.030 --> 19:59.563
man.

19:59.697 --> 20:00.664
i remember when we were

20:00.798 --> 20:02.098
presenting it at sundance.

20:02.233 --> 20:04.467
they were scared to death that

20:04.602 --> 20:05.769
the reaction would be "this was

20:05.903 --> 20:06.703
shot on video."

20:06.837 --> 20:09.306
the digital presentation did not

20:09.440 --> 20:12.309
look nearly, in any way, like an

20:12.443 --> 20:14.144
acceptable substitute for what

20:14.278 --> 20:14.811
film was.

20:14.946 --> 20:16.880
because of, um...

20:17.848 --> 20:19.983
porn and because of documentary

20:20.117 --> 20:21.551
and because of news footage,

20:21.686 --> 20:23.086
video occupies a space

20:23.221 --> 20:24.287
in your mind where you're

20:24.422 --> 20:25.789
kind of like, "i'm here.

20:25.923 --> 20:26.923
i'm in that room with them.

20:27.058 --> 20:27.824
oh, my god, is this really

20:27.959 --> 20:28.491
happening?"

20:28.626 --> 20:29.726
and that makes chuck and buck

20:29.860 --> 20:30.393
better.

20:30.528 --> 20:32.529
people were starting to think

20:32.663 --> 20:33.997
in a completely different way

20:34.131 --> 20:36.166
about, "how could the technology

20:36.300 --> 20:38.835
and the medium help us to

20:38.970 --> 20:42.372
rethink filmmaking?"

20:42.506 --> 20:44.140
you started to see people

20:44.275 --> 20:46.343
start to challenge the idea- 

20:46.477 --> 20:47.911
as did the group known as

20:48.045 --> 20:50.280
indigent.

20:50.414 --> 20:51.781
they were creating

20:51.916 --> 20:54.384
standard- def video that would

20:54.518 --> 20:57.454
then be converted to film for

20:57.588 --> 20:58.588
theatrical release.

20:58.723 --> 21:00.023
i think as an independent

21:00.157 --> 21:01.524
filmmaker, we are in the most

21:01.659 --> 21:05.262
exciting time ever, because now

21:05.396 --> 21:06.630
we can go out and make a film

21:06.764 --> 21:07.998
on dv.

21:08.132 --> 21:08.865
oscar has a new

21:09.000 --> 21:10.667
girlfriend.

21:10.801 --> 21:11.334
really?

21:11.469 --> 21:12.535
mm- hmm.

21:12.670 --> 21:13.970
it seems last evening, he had

21:14.105 --> 21:14.804
quite the late- night

21:14.939 --> 21:16.673
conversation.

21:16.807 --> 21:19.175
the idea was that if you

21:19.310 --> 21:20.944
shoot digitally, it's cheap.

21:21.078 --> 21:23.046
and it absolutely helped fuel

21:23.180 --> 21:24.447
the number of films that got

21:24.582 --> 21:25.282
made.

21:25.416 --> 21:26.683
i remember, though, my first

21:26.817 --> 21:29.052
year at sundance, we had 225

21:29.186 --> 21:30.987
submissions total for the

21:31.122 --> 21:32.522
fiction category.

21:32.657 --> 21:33.723
you know, a few years later, it

21:33.858 --> 21:34.557
was ten times that.

21:34.692 --> 21:36.293
back to, like, you know, the

21:36.427 --> 21:38.395
sundance days or, you know, the

21:38.529 --> 21:40.463
releases of indigent, people

21:40.598 --> 21:42.732
were saying, "well, that's okay

21:42.867 --> 21:45.068
for you- it's independent- 

21:45.202 --> 21:46.303
but this isn't cinema.

21:46.437 --> 21:47.871
this isn't"- 

21:48.005 --> 21:49.806
that was a huge thing to make

21:49.940 --> 21:52.042
a film on a video camera and go

21:52.176 --> 21:54.044
to sundance and win best

21:54.178 --> 21:56.012
director and win best film for

21:56.147 --> 21:57.080
personal velocity.

21:57.214 --> 21:57.747
tell us about her.

21:57.882 --> 21:59.649
gary's own film, tadpole, ended

21:59.784 --> 22:01.251
up being sold for an enormous

22:01.385 --> 22:02.686
amount of money, and everyone

22:02.820 --> 22:03.887
that worked on it made money

22:04.021 --> 22:04.721
from that sale.

22:04.855 --> 22:07.123
and that's when a lot of the

22:07.258 --> 22:09.125
idea of, "wait a second.

22:09.260 --> 22:11.461
you can shoot films digitally,

22:11.595 --> 22:12.495
and it's almost like a

22:12.630 --> 22:14.130
production aesthetic," and

22:14.265 --> 22:15.198
that's when all the debate

22:15.333 --> 22:15.865
started.

22:16.000 --> 22:16.800
i mean, you must have heard

22:16.934 --> 22:18.468
in the late '90s "film is the

22:18.602 --> 22:19.202
gold standard."

22:19.337 --> 22:19.869
yeah.

22:20.004 --> 22:20.804
and the tools that you're

22:20.938 --> 22:22.372
playing with are what?

22:22.506 --> 22:24.841
debasing, threatening.

22:24.975 --> 22:26.242
i have been slapped around.

22:26.377 --> 22:26.910
if you want to- 

22:27.044 --> 22:27.577
what do you mean,

22:27.712 --> 22:28.511
"slapped around"?

22:28.646 --> 22:29.946
i-  i mean, i've been

22:30.081 --> 22:32.048
applauded and almost executed

22:32.183 --> 22:33.316
for the same sentence.

22:33.451 --> 22:35.285
it was quite obvious for me

22:35.419 --> 22:38.288
to go to digital, because of,

22:38.422 --> 22:40.290
you know, the material you could

22:40.424 --> 22:41.057
have in the camera.

22:41.192 --> 22:42.425
the amount of material you could

22:42.560 --> 22:44.294
have in the camera was obvious.

22:45.563 --> 22:47.797
since i was trying to create

22:47.932 --> 22:49.299
another way of working with

22:49.433 --> 22:51.901
actors, and that was essential.

22:52.036 --> 22:53.069
i imagine there was, like,

22:53.204 --> 22:55.038
a liberation for you, then,

22:55.172 --> 22:56.139
in terms of the relationship

22:56.273 --> 22:58.708
with your actors, longer takes- 

22:58.843 --> 22:59.743
as you know, keanu,

22:59.877 --> 23:02.479
ten minutes was maximum.

23:02.613 --> 23:03.546
it wasn't even really ten.

23:03.681 --> 23:05.815
it was nine- something, you know.

23:05.950 --> 23:06.950
and when that thing starts

23:07.084 --> 23:09.919
rolling, there's a kind of

23:10.054 --> 23:11.221
underlying feeling that it's

23:11.355 --> 23:13.022
precious stuff rolling through

23:13.157 --> 23:15.525
there, and it puts a kind of

23:15.659 --> 23:17.861
a tension on things.

23:17.995 --> 23:19.362
i could shoot as much as

23:19.497 --> 23:19.996
i wanted.

23:20.131 --> 23:20.964
i could get the best

23:21.098 --> 23:21.731
performances.

23:21.866 --> 23:23.299
i didn't have to worry about

23:23.434 --> 23:24.234
shooting these little bursts of

23:24.368 --> 23:24.901
film.

23:25.035 --> 23:25.869
you know, that was ridiculous,

23:26.003 --> 23:27.203
but that's what i had to do.

23:27.338 --> 23:28.938
that's how expensive it was

23:29.073 --> 23:30.840
comparatively.

23:30.975 --> 23:33.943
digital- a little gizmo- 

23:34.078 --> 23:37.547
40 minutes, and you can be

23:37.681 --> 23:40.383
running this camera and talking

23:40.518 --> 23:41.718
to the actor,

23:41.852 --> 23:43.353
starting over again.

23:43.487 --> 23:45.021
reveal.

23:45.156 --> 23:46.823
and now you go around and

23:46.957 --> 23:50.193
look up.

23:50.327 --> 23:52.362
and they get down in there and

23:52.496 --> 23:53.763
they catch a thing that

23:53.898 --> 23:55.965
never would get caught if you

23:56.100 --> 23:58.301
had that giant thing there.

23:58.436 --> 24:00.236
i love to run the camera,

24:00.371 --> 24:01.938
especially when we're in an

24:02.072 --> 24:03.740
emotional place and magic is

24:03.874 --> 24:04.441
happening.

24:04.575 --> 24:06.242
when you go "cut," then all of

24:06.377 --> 24:07.343
a sudden, everybody gets in

24:07.478 --> 24:09.813
there, and you were at a place

24:09.947 --> 24:12.982
where it was just there, and

24:13.117 --> 24:14.050
then everything stops.

24:14.185 --> 24:15.018
and it's like, "okay, now go

24:15.152 --> 24:15.885
back to that."

24:16.020 --> 24:16.753
now it's like, "no, just run

24:16.887 --> 24:18.321
the camera, back to one."

24:18.456 --> 24:19.989
okay, guys, stand by.

24:20.124 --> 24:21.491
in five.

24:21.625 --> 24:23.793
as fast as you can get back

24:23.928 --> 24:26.596
to your position, you can go

24:26.730 --> 24:27.330
again.

24:27.465 --> 24:28.932
and i've just always felt

24:29.066 --> 24:30.133
there was just way too much

24:30.267 --> 24:32.402
waiting, because movies for me,

24:32.536 --> 24:34.137
there's always that momentum

24:34.271 --> 24:36.172
problem, you know,

24:36.307 --> 24:37.140
'cause i grew up in

24:37.274 --> 24:38.942
the theater, and that's how

24:39.076 --> 24:39.876
i was trained,

24:40.010 --> 24:41.811
and a lot of times in movies,

24:41.946 --> 24:45.448
i feel like, "can we go?"

24:46.283 --> 24:47.150
it's very tough for me to say

24:47.284 --> 24:48.651
that i need to be able to shoot

24:48.786 --> 24:50.053
a 45- minute take or something

24:50.187 --> 24:51.120
and not reload the cameras,

24:51.255 --> 24:53.289
because the truth is, the entire

24:53.424 --> 24:54.624
crew can only concentrate, the

24:54.758 --> 24:55.892
actors can only concentrate for

24:56.026 --> 24:57.060
so long, and then you need a

24:57.194 --> 24:58.194
two- minute break, a three- minute

24:58.329 --> 24:59.395
break, during which time

24:59.530 --> 25:00.063
you reload.

25:00.197 --> 25:01.197
when you're running a film

25:01.332 --> 25:02.899
camera on set, everyone seems to

25:03.033 --> 25:04.334
take things a little bit more

25:04.468 --> 25:06.069
seriously.

25:06.203 --> 25:07.070
when they hear the film

25:07.204 --> 25:08.037
running- when they hear the

25:08.172 --> 25:08.938
money running through the

25:09.073 --> 25:10.740
camera, basically- everybody

25:10.875 --> 25:12.308
brings their "a" game.

25:12.443 --> 25:12.976
action.

25:13.110 --> 25:15.578
then puts it together again,

25:15.713 --> 25:16.246
how it carries you to- 

25:16.380 --> 25:18.281
the first time i'd ever heard

25:18.415 --> 25:21.718
the whir of film going through

25:21.852 --> 25:25.154
a camera, it was thrilling.

25:25.289 --> 25:26.856
also made me very nervous

25:26.991 --> 25:29.092
because all of the sudden, each

25:29.226 --> 25:31.227
take counted in a way that i had

25:31.362 --> 25:34.831
never really experienced before.

25:34.965 --> 25:36.032
what about that moment after

25:36.166 --> 25:37.000
you say "action"?

25:37.134 --> 25:38.568
like, for me, when that camera's

25:38.702 --> 25:39.802
rolling, i guess maybe it's

25:39.937 --> 25:41.371
connected to the money, but the

25:41.505 --> 25:43.139
ten- minute reel is so finite.

25:43.274 --> 25:44.140
it's almost an athletic

25:44.275 --> 25:47.877
thing, like, "focus, focus.

25:48.012 --> 25:48.645
uh."

25:48.779 --> 25:50.547
you know, like, that's good for

25:50.681 --> 25:51.981
the- 

25:52.116 --> 25:53.917
that's just atmosphere, though,

25:54.051 --> 25:54.584
you know?

25:54.718 --> 25:55.785
i mean, if you want that, you

25:55.920 --> 25:56.986
can create that, right?

25:57.121 --> 25:57.687
i thought it would make

25:57.821 --> 25:58.721
a difference to actors.

25:58.856 --> 25:59.522
i don't think it does

25:59.657 --> 26:00.723
particularly to actors.

26:00.858 --> 26:02.792
i think actors just infinitely

26:02.927 --> 26:03.993
adjust to whatever they- 

26:04.128 --> 26:05.028
whatever way they have to tell

26:05.162 --> 26:06.062
it, they'll tell it.

26:06.196 --> 26:07.230
they didn't ask for a break?

26:07.364 --> 26:08.364
they didn't say, "hey, can we

26:08.499 --> 26:09.132
stop?"

26:09.934 --> 26:11.100
you're on digital now.

26:11.235 --> 26:13.202
yeah, but my first experience

26:13.337 --> 26:14.737
with that was just, you know,

26:14.872 --> 26:16.539
there was no "cut."

26:16.674 --> 26:17.507
you know, i worked with richard

26:17.641 --> 26:18.608
linklater on a film called

26:18.742 --> 26:19.275
a scanner darkly...

26:19.410 --> 26:19.943
oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:20.077 --> 26:20.944
and it was just like- 

26:21.078 --> 26:21.678
you could just go on.

26:21.812 --> 26:22.478
yeah, i was just, like,

26:22.613 --> 26:24.314
"can we please stop?"

26:25.416 --> 26:27.383
"stop."

26:27.518 --> 26:28.484
no, we don't have to.

26:28.619 --> 26:30.553
but- but i wanted to.

26:30.688 --> 26:31.821
camera right or left?

26:31.956 --> 26:32.722
robert downey actually came

26:32.856 --> 26:35.625
up to me, and he said,

26:35.759 --> 26:36.993
"i can't work like this.

26:37.127 --> 26:38.328
i never get to go to my trailer.

26:38.462 --> 26:39.862
i never get my shit together.

26:39.997 --> 26:41.531
i'm on my feet 14 hours a day.

26:41.665 --> 26:43.066
i'm shooting all the time."

26:43.200 --> 26:46.135
he actually left mason jars of

26:46.270 --> 26:49.072
urine on the set, just, like,

26:49.206 --> 26:50.006
over in the corner and stuff.

26:50.140 --> 26:50.773
just- he would go off and he

26:50.908 --> 26:51.608
would pee, and then he'd bring

26:51.742 --> 26:52.275
it back.

26:52.409 --> 26:53.176
and that was his, like,

26:53.310 --> 26:55.178
form of protest.

26:55.312 --> 26:56.646
i'd previously worked on

26:56.780 --> 26:59.082
celluloid only, really, and been

26:59.216 --> 27:01.284
thrilled, you know, to arrive at

27:01.418 --> 27:02.685
the holy grail of celluloid.

27:02.820 --> 27:03.553
it was, like, amazing.

27:03.687 --> 27:04.754
so i made the first few films on

27:04.888 --> 27:05.622
celluloid.

27:05.756 --> 27:07.023
i made a very big hollywood

27:07.157 --> 27:09.592
film, the beach, with leonardo

27:09.727 --> 27:12.195
dicaprio and a big crew, and it

27:12.329 --> 27:13.663
didn't suit me at all.

27:13.797 --> 27:15.565
i felt it was too much away from

27:15.699 --> 27:17.033
me, really, somehow.

27:17.167 --> 27:20.903
and so i then saw celebration.

27:23.774 --> 27:25.241
it wasn't so much the film.

27:25.376 --> 27:27.410
it wasn't even the look.

27:27.544 --> 27:28.778
it was the camera operating,

27:28.912 --> 27:32.782
that movement of the camera.

27:32.916 --> 27:34.183
and so i got in touch with the

27:34.318 --> 27:35.418
guy who shot it, anthony dod

27:35.552 --> 27:37.487
mantle, and i said, "well,

27:37.621 --> 27:39.222
i feel like i'm not doing the

27:39.356 --> 27:40.990
right thing anymore.

27:41.125 --> 27:43.026
can we do something together

27:43.160 --> 27:43.693
digitally?"

27:43.827 --> 27:44.494
which- i didn't really know

27:44.628 --> 27:45.161
what i was saying by

27:45.295 --> 27:45.828
saying that.

27:45.963 --> 27:46.863
it was kind of like a new word,

27:46.997 --> 27:47.530
in a way.

27:47.665 --> 27:49.032
then we came up with the script,

27:49.166 --> 27:51.534
28 days later, and we shot it

27:51.669 --> 27:54.137
on consumer cameras.

27:54.271 --> 27:55.238
but i remember anthony saying to

27:55.372 --> 27:57.774
me, "it's all very well working

27:57.908 --> 27:58.675
in this format, you know,"

27:58.809 --> 27:59.542
but he said, "i'll never get

27:59.677 --> 28:00.209
an oscar."

28:03.147 --> 28:04.047
there was a sequence in it at

28:04.181 --> 28:05.048
the beginning where the

28:05.182 --> 28:05.915
character, cillian murphy,

28:06.050 --> 28:08.284
wanders round a deserted london.

28:08.419 --> 28:10.720
hello!

28:10.854 --> 28:11.688
and we would not have been

28:11.822 --> 28:12.422
able to achieve the film

28:12.556 --> 28:14.724
on film, because we had to

28:14.858 --> 28:15.425
stop traffic.

28:15.559 --> 28:16.192
we didn't have the money to do

28:16.326 --> 28:17.427
it, so what we would do is, we'd

28:17.561 --> 28:19.862
just hold the traffic briefly,

28:19.997 --> 28:20.697
but because we were on these

28:20.831 --> 28:22.465
cameras, we could use ten of

28:22.599 --> 28:25.301
them 'cause they're so cheap,

28:25.436 --> 28:26.703
and he could walk through

28:26.837 --> 28:28.604
central london- an area of it- 

28:28.739 --> 28:29.739
and we had ten cameras on it.

28:29.873 --> 28:31.140
so you'd only have to stop the

28:31.275 --> 28:32.141
traffic for a few minutes, and

28:32.276 --> 28:33.710
then you would actually have

28:33.844 --> 28:34.477
ten shots.

28:34.611 --> 28:36.879
that was an enormous advantage.

28:37.014 --> 28:37.747
well, i placed cameras

28:37.881 --> 28:40.116
around- not coincidentally and

28:40.250 --> 28:41.150
not badly and not loosely.

28:41.285 --> 28:42.485
i try to control every angle,

28:42.619 --> 28:43.486
and i know roughly where it's

28:43.620 --> 28:45.688
best, when it's gonna be used.

28:45.823 --> 28:46.789
but that said, you can let it

28:46.924 --> 28:47.857
run a bit, and because it's

28:47.991 --> 28:50.126
digital, you get something.

28:50.260 --> 28:51.761
if you were in a wide shot

28:51.895 --> 28:53.296
with a small figure in it, they

28:53.430 --> 28:54.664
were just, like, two or three

28:54.798 --> 28:55.331
pixels.

28:55.466 --> 28:56.265
i mean, there was nothing there.

28:56.400 --> 28:57.567
there was just the color.

28:57.701 --> 28:59.001
quality- wise, if you put it up

28:59.136 --> 29:00.403
against an exact copy of it on

29:00.537 --> 29:01.738
film, the film would be

29:01.872 --> 29:03.272
immeasurably superior,

29:03.407 --> 29:05.074
but you could shoot illegally

29:05.209 --> 29:06.609
and surreptitiously without

29:06.744 --> 29:07.810
people knowing.

29:07.945 --> 29:08.911
you could do unconventional

29:09.046 --> 29:09.812
things.

29:09.947 --> 29:11.380
and the rhythm of film, which

29:11.515 --> 29:12.648
has been passed on since it

29:12.783 --> 29:14.751
began and crews have learned- 

29:14.885 --> 29:15.752
you interrupted that.

29:15.886 --> 29:17.987
i loved that freedom, and i got

29:18.122 --> 29:18.988
the taste for it then.

29:19.123 --> 29:20.289
and i knew once we'd shot that

29:20.424 --> 29:22.558
sequence, that i was gonna work

29:22.693 --> 29:23.226
on it now.

29:23.360 --> 29:24.093
that was what i wanted to

29:24.228 --> 29:26.162
work on.

29:26.964 --> 29:28.231
it makes the editor's job

29:28.365 --> 29:29.232
extraordinary 'cause they're

29:29.366 --> 29:31.667
often plowing through masses and

29:31.802 --> 29:33.736
masses and masses of material.

29:35.072 --> 29:37.039
in the 1970s and '80s,

29:37.174 --> 29:38.708
electronics companies began

29:38.842 --> 29:40.510
working on solutions to replace

29:40.644 --> 29:42.812
film editing.

29:42.946 --> 29:44.747
for over 100 years, editing

29:44.882 --> 29:46.282
meant physically cutting and

29:46.416 --> 29:48.484
connecting pieces of film.

29:48.619 --> 29:49.418
when you used to go to an

29:49.553 --> 29:50.920
editing room, they brought in

29:51.054 --> 29:53.022
the trim basket, they took the

29:53.157 --> 29:55.558
film out, they looked at it

29:55.692 --> 29:56.793
through the moviola, and then

29:56.927 --> 29:57.860
you slapped it together like

29:57.995 --> 29:59.128
this- you remember, the white

29:59.263 --> 30:00.229
gloves- and they were incredibly

30:00.364 --> 30:00.897
fast at it.

30:01.031 --> 30:02.565
i'd find the frame, i'd- you

30:02.699 --> 30:04.634
know, sometimes splicing to the

30:04.768 --> 30:06.402
point of, you know, getting your

30:06.537 --> 30:08.037
fingertips bloodied, you know,

30:08.172 --> 30:09.038
and that was really the blood in

30:09.173 --> 30:09.705
the film.

30:09.840 --> 30:10.907
so, i mean, you really had it,

30:11.041 --> 30:12.542
and now it's, you know,

30:12.676 --> 30:13.609
pressing little buttons.

30:13.744 --> 30:14.710
now this is the floppy disk

30:14.845 --> 30:15.711
that we're all familiar with.

30:15.846 --> 30:17.446
early editing systems used

30:17.581 --> 30:19.482
multiple magnetic disks, tape

30:19.616 --> 30:21.551
machines, and laser disks to

30:21.685 --> 30:24.053
store and read digitized film.

30:24.188 --> 30:25.288
most of these systems were

30:25.422 --> 30:27.323
enormous and very costly.

30:27.457 --> 30:28.157
the first thing that

30:28.292 --> 30:29.058
happened, really, that changed

30:29.193 --> 30:30.359
everything, i think, was the

30:30.494 --> 30:32.328
digital editing machine, which

30:32.462 --> 30:33.529
meant our dailies had to be

30:33.664 --> 30:36.332
converted from film into tape.

30:36.466 --> 30:37.466
so that started a whole thing

30:37.601 --> 30:39.735
going.

30:39.870 --> 30:40.903
we started a picture editing

30:41.038 --> 30:43.439
system that was all digital.

30:43.574 --> 30:45.575
we had the first edit droid

30:45.709 --> 30:47.610
working in 1980,

30:47.744 --> 30:49.378
and eventually, we sold the

30:49.513 --> 30:51.347
system to avid.

30:51.481 --> 30:53.683
by the late 1980s, avid had

30:53.817 --> 30:55.318
developed digital editing into

30:55.452 --> 30:57.153
a compact, cost- effective,

30:57.287 --> 30:59.322
computer- based system.

30:59.456 --> 31:02.124
when i first saw the avid as

31:02.259 --> 31:05.194
a demo, the image quality was

31:05.329 --> 31:07.897
blocky and tiny, and i said,

31:08.031 --> 31:09.532
"this is gonna be really good

31:09.666 --> 31:10.967
when they get the image quality

31:11.101 --> 31:12.201
right in about five years' time.

31:12.336 --> 31:13.936
why not try it on the avid?

31:14.071 --> 31:15.571
and, you know, i'm also one of

31:15.706 --> 31:17.006
those early adopter people.

31:17.140 --> 31:21.844
i like to leap into the unknown.

31:21.979 --> 31:23.646
i remember on the english

31:23.780 --> 31:26.182
patient, i suddenly really

31:26.316 --> 31:27.750
looked at the image and said,

31:27.885 --> 31:28.718
"oh, no."

31:29.987 --> 31:30.753
"how am i gonna be able to do

31:30.888 --> 31:31.420
this?"

31:31.555 --> 31:33.756
when i'd work with older

31:33.891 --> 31:35.892
editors, they'll often talk

31:36.026 --> 31:37.426
about the time when computers

31:37.561 --> 31:39.295
were starting to come in

31:39.429 --> 31:40.596
and say, you know, they were

31:40.731 --> 31:42.064
very resistant to it because

31:42.199 --> 31:42.999
they weren't familiar with

31:43.133 --> 31:43.699
computers.

31:43.834 --> 31:46.168
they were just scared that they

31:46.303 --> 31:47.570
didn't know enough about it.

31:47.704 --> 31:49.405
if you pushed this button or if

31:49.539 --> 31:50.940
you accidentally turned it off

31:51.074 --> 31:52.375
wrong or turned it on wrong,

31:52.509 --> 31:53.776
that everything would be gone,

31:53.911 --> 31:55.177
whereas that could never happen

31:55.312 --> 31:56.812
if you actually physically had

31:56.947 --> 31:57.747
the film in your hand.

31:57.881 --> 31:58.547
they thought, "that's not

31:58.682 --> 31:59.215
editing.

31:59.349 --> 32:01.450
editing is..."

32:01.585 --> 32:03.319
so when you're editing a movie

32:03.453 --> 32:05.121
on film, that's just the

32:05.255 --> 32:05.788
technology.

32:05.923 --> 32:08.190
the art form is the manipulation

32:08.325 --> 32:09.825
of images to tell a story.

32:09.960 --> 32:11.527
it was extremely difficult

32:11.662 --> 32:14.764
for me to learn because i hadn't

32:14.898 --> 32:16.299
used a computer.

32:16.433 --> 32:17.600
i thought a mouse was something

32:17.734 --> 32:18.901
that ran across the floor.

32:19.036 --> 32:20.369
i mean, i was that ignorant.

32:21.872 --> 32:24.307
but i learned, and i kicked

32:24.441 --> 32:25.908
the machine quite a bit, but

32:26.043 --> 32:27.576
once i'd got going on it, i was

32:27.711 --> 32:28.978
okay, and i liked it.

32:29.112 --> 32:30.046
there's no film in the

32:30.180 --> 32:31.380
editing bay.

32:31.515 --> 32:32.915
it's all a kind of- 

32:33.050 --> 32:35.952
it's drives, and it's quiet.

32:36.086 --> 32:36.786
you know, i don't hear- i used

32:36.920 --> 32:37.453
to hear...

32:38.388 --> 32:39.255
you know, the reels on the

32:39.389 --> 32:39.922
benches.

32:41.091 --> 32:42.558
it was a very noisy, kind of

32:42.693 --> 32:44.994
bustling atmosphere, and now

32:45.128 --> 32:47.029
it's very quiet.

32:47.164 --> 32:48.164
it's almost like, you know,

32:48.298 --> 32:49.799
i can burn incense...

32:50.767 --> 32:52.702
and light candles.

32:54.404 --> 32:56.505
digital brings you speed, and

32:56.640 --> 32:59.875
it almost challenges you in the

33:00.010 --> 33:01.811
sense of, "can i think that

33:01.945 --> 33:03.279
fast?

33:03.413 --> 33:05.247
do i need time to breathe?"

33:05.382 --> 33:06.782
sometimes these young

33:06.917 --> 33:07.850
editors, who were very

33:07.985 --> 33:09.352
interesting and doing extremely

33:09.486 --> 33:11.354
interesting work- but they don't

33:11.488 --> 33:13.889
always have the time to sit,

33:14.024 --> 33:15.524
just sit back and think about

33:15.659 --> 33:17.226
what they're doing.

33:17.361 --> 33:18.327
and i think that if they work on

33:18.462 --> 33:21.197
film, they have probably trained

33:21.331 --> 33:22.631
their minds to do that a little

33:22.766 --> 33:24.367
bit more.

33:24.501 --> 33:25.468
and so it's a different way of

33:25.602 --> 33:26.502
thinking, really.

33:26.636 --> 33:29.405
film taught you a discipline

33:29.539 --> 33:31.907
that is gone a little bit from

33:32.042 --> 33:34.043
the computer because once you

33:34.177 --> 33:36.345
put the scissors in, you've then

33:36.480 --> 33:37.413
got to join it back together

33:37.547 --> 33:39.415
with sticky tape, and it bumps

33:39.549 --> 33:41.150
through the machine, so you were

33:41.284 --> 33:43.886
much more decisive about it.

33:44.021 --> 33:45.721
has editing gotten better

33:45.856 --> 33:46.856
because there's infinite choice?

33:46.990 --> 33:48.357
i'm not so sure.

33:48.492 --> 33:49.658
in fact, i'm pretty sure there's

33:49.793 --> 33:50.860
a lot of movies that have gotten

33:50.994 --> 33:55.164
worse because you manipulate it

33:55.298 --> 33:56.532
to death.

33:56.666 --> 33:58.067
we may have lost something.

33:58.201 --> 34:00.202
the cut in lawrence of

34:00.337 --> 34:02.371
arabia where he blows the match

34:02.506 --> 34:03.172
out...

34:03.306 --> 34:05.207
it is recognized that you

34:05.342 --> 34:07.176
have a funny sense of fun.

34:07.310 --> 34:08.277
well, that was a dissolve in

34:08.411 --> 34:09.445
the script.

34:09.579 --> 34:11.347
and if you'd been on a digital

34:11.481 --> 34:13.014
as we are today, we would have

34:13.150 --> 34:14.449
only ever seen it as

34:14.583 --> 34:15.684
a dissolve.

34:15.819 --> 34:17.253
in those days, the film was

34:17.387 --> 34:18.954
butted together like that, just

34:19.089 --> 34:21.389
with a direct cut, and so, when

34:21.525 --> 34:22.358
we saw it, we thought,

34:22.492 --> 34:24.527
"wow, that's fantastic."

34:24.661 --> 34:25.527
it just worked.

34:25.661 --> 34:26.629
it just was magic, you know,

34:26.763 --> 34:30.166
when you feel that feeling.

34:30.300 --> 34:32.768
digital is this unbelievably

34:32.902 --> 34:35.804
malleable plastic of imagery and

34:35.938 --> 34:38.306
sound, and that's seductive,

34:38.442 --> 34:39.074
because that's what we do,

34:39.208 --> 34:39.742
you know?

34:39.876 --> 34:43.079
we are sculptors of images and

34:43.213 --> 34:43.813
sound.

34:43.947 --> 34:44.813
it's not that you can't do it

34:44.947 --> 34:45.915
with film.

34:46.049 --> 34:49.118
it's just that it's harder to do

34:49.252 --> 34:51.687
that and make it look good.

34:53.556 --> 34:54.824
as digital technology

34:54.958 --> 34:56.225
continued to grow,

34:56.359 --> 34:58.260
computer- generated images,

34:58.395 --> 35:00.830
or cgi, were appearing more

35:00.964 --> 35:05.201
and more in movies.

35:05.335 --> 35:08.370
visual effects, or vfx, have

35:08.505 --> 35:09.972
been part of filmmaking since

35:10.107 --> 35:12.174
the earliest years.

35:12.309 --> 35:13.609
camera tricks, lighting

35:13.743 --> 35:15.611
techniques, elaborate models,

35:15.745 --> 35:18.047
and lab processes have all been

35:18.181 --> 35:19.648
used to alter reality and

35:19.783 --> 35:20.950
enhance the moviegoing

35:21.084 --> 35:22.685
experience.

35:22.819 --> 35:23.552
on many films, there are

35:23.687 --> 35:24.386
a number of things that are

35:24.521 --> 35:25.621
depicted that you can't just go

35:25.755 --> 35:27.857
out and shoot, so the images you

35:27.991 --> 35:28.824
need to see need to be

35:28.959 --> 35:32.128
manufactured in some way.

35:32.262 --> 35:32.895
being a visual effects

35:33.029 --> 35:34.330
supervisor calls on you to

35:34.464 --> 35:36.632
understand a huge variety of

35:36.766 --> 35:38.434
different aspects of the world

35:38.568 --> 35:40.069
around us at any one time.

35:40.203 --> 35:41.203
you've also got to understand

35:41.338 --> 35:43.672
the physics of the way light

35:43.807 --> 35:45.441
reacts to different surfaces.

35:45.575 --> 35:46.575
you've got to understand

35:46.710 --> 35:47.243
animation.

35:47.377 --> 35:48.244
you've got to understand the way

35:48.378 --> 35:51.080
people move, creatures move.

35:51.214 --> 35:52.381
you have to be an artist and

35:52.516 --> 35:54.416
a technician at the same time,

35:54.551 --> 35:55.551
you know, and that's an

35:55.685 --> 35:56.819
interesting combination.

35:56.953 --> 35:58.387
originally, when effects were

35:58.522 --> 35:59.722
done, or for the first 100 years

35:59.856 --> 36:01.157
that effects were done,

36:01.291 --> 36:03.692
they were done, you know, with

36:03.827 --> 36:06.562
models and with film cameras,

36:06.696 --> 36:07.630
and they were very sort of

36:07.764 --> 36:09.632
limited, what they can do.

36:09.766 --> 36:11.700
but a lot of time and energy- 

36:11.835 --> 36:13.169
and people put a lot of work

36:13.303 --> 36:14.570
into being able to make the

36:14.704 --> 36:16.639
star wars films.

36:21.311 --> 36:22.311
when i started doing this

36:22.445 --> 36:25.047
about 22 years ago, the

36:25.182 --> 36:26.348
environment i learned in was

36:26.483 --> 36:27.016
a physical one.

36:27.150 --> 36:29.218
it was a stage, miniatures,

36:29.352 --> 36:32.555
cameras, lights, everything.

36:32.689 --> 36:34.123
the great thing about making

36:34.257 --> 36:36.525
real stuff is, you get to use

36:36.660 --> 36:37.927
all of your senses and your

36:38.061 --> 36:39.128
physical perceptions.

36:39.262 --> 36:40.496
and to stand there with three

36:40.630 --> 36:41.730
other people and critique

36:41.865 --> 36:43.232
a model or talk about how cool

36:43.366 --> 36:44.166
something looks under real

36:44.301 --> 36:47.836
lighting is pretty satisfying.

36:47.971 --> 36:49.138
and all of this photography

36:49.272 --> 36:50.172
would end up in an optical

36:50.307 --> 36:52.875
printer in the end.

36:53.009 --> 36:54.677
that's a large device that

36:54.811 --> 36:56.212
actually compresses layers of

36:56.346 --> 36:58.280
film together and creates new

36:58.415 --> 36:59.515
exposures of film so that you

36:59.649 --> 37:01.083
can combine layers of images

37:01.218 --> 37:02.418
into the final one that you see

37:02.552 --> 37:05.554
in the movie.

37:05.689 --> 37:07.156
the visual effects department

37:07.290 --> 37:09.758
was literally sandwiching one

37:09.893 --> 37:11.961
piece of film next to another

37:12.095 --> 37:14.296
piece of film, and that really

37:14.431 --> 37:15.764
introduces a huge amount of

37:15.899 --> 37:18.267
degradation.

37:18.401 --> 37:21.470
in 1978, we had just finished

37:21.605 --> 37:24.506
star wars, we'd done some

37:24.641 --> 37:26.242
digital shots in there which

37:26.376 --> 37:28.377
were very, very crude.

37:28.511 --> 37:29.245
you know, the diagram of the

37:29.379 --> 37:29.979
death star and that kind of

37:30.113 --> 37:30.646
stuff.

37:30.780 --> 37:32.047
but i knew a lot of guys that

37:32.182 --> 37:33.182
were working in the digital

37:33.316 --> 37:35.084
field, so i started a computer

37:35.218 --> 37:38.120
division, and we developed the

37:38.255 --> 37:40.756
pixar computer for i.l.m.

37:40.890 --> 37:41.957
i'm right now in one of our

37:42.092 --> 37:43.292
three computer rooms that we

37:43.426 --> 37:45.127
have here at i.l.m., and what we

37:45.262 --> 37:46.829
have here are thousands and

37:46.963 --> 37:48.731
millions of cycles of computing

37:48.865 --> 37:49.732
power going by every single

37:49.866 --> 37:50.399
second.

37:50.533 --> 37:51.767
so i kind of pushed the stuff- 

37:51.901 --> 37:52.635
at least as much as i could- 

37:52.769 --> 37:55.237
here at i.l.m. with this

37:55.372 --> 37:57.306
graphics group that we had.

37:59.909 --> 38:00.809
the exciting thing about it

38:00.944 --> 38:02.111
was, it didn't feel like there

38:02.245 --> 38:03.545
were a lot of rules.

38:03.680 --> 38:04.747
it really did seem like, kind

38:04.881 --> 38:05.714
of, the wild west.

38:05.849 --> 38:07.316
it started to become possible

38:07.450 --> 38:10.519
to scan in film and bring the

38:10.654 --> 38:13.522
film into the computer and make

38:13.657 --> 38:15.791
changes to that.

38:17.127 --> 38:18.661
the massive advantage to

38:18.795 --> 38:21.897
digitizing your film was that

38:22.032 --> 38:23.499
you wouldn't get any

38:23.633 --> 38:24.800
degradation.

38:24.934 --> 38:26.835
once it's digital, those are

38:26.970 --> 38:28.170
ones and zeros, and they just

38:28.305 --> 38:29.672
stay as ones and zeros all the

38:29.806 --> 38:31.807
way down the pipe.

38:31.941 --> 38:32.941
digital became important from

38:33.076 --> 38:34.543
an effects point of view.

38:34.678 --> 38:36.879
the first path through the

38:37.013 --> 38:38.981
system was in the effects arena,

38:39.115 --> 38:39.715
okay?

38:39.849 --> 38:43.018
it was using digital technology

38:43.153 --> 38:45.354
to realize visions.

38:45.488 --> 38:46.522
okay, if you can take a piece

38:46.656 --> 38:47.589
of film and you can turn it into

38:47.724 --> 38:48.824
numbers, you can manipulate

38:48.958 --> 38:49.758
those numbers and then put it

38:49.893 --> 38:51.660
back onto the film, boy, there- 

38:51.795 --> 38:53.295
there's no limit to what you

38:53.430 --> 38:54.563
could do.

38:54.698 --> 38:57.499
the entire world is wide open.

38:57.634 --> 38:59.968
the first real image that we

39:00.103 --> 39:02.071
did that was completely digital

39:02.205 --> 39:05.274
was in young sherlock holmes.

39:05.408 --> 39:07.443
we had a character made out

39:07.577 --> 39:08.844
of stained glass, but the glass

39:08.978 --> 39:10.079
actually had to look like it was

39:10.213 --> 39:11.980
real, not like a graphic of any

39:12.115 --> 39:13.148
sort.

39:13.283 --> 39:14.516
and it took us six months to do

39:14.651 --> 39:16.452
seven shots, which was pretty

39:16.586 --> 39:18.487
complicated but amazing that we

39:18.621 --> 39:19.254
got it done in that amount of

39:19.389 --> 39:19.922
time.

39:20.056 --> 39:21.023
george was always very

39:21.157 --> 39:23.325
progressive about digital, and

39:23.460 --> 39:24.493
it was just something about

39:24.627 --> 39:25.794
that- the effects community

39:25.929 --> 39:27.529
just got comfortable with it

39:27.664 --> 39:29.598
really early on.

39:36.039 --> 39:37.673
get rid of the flare!

39:37.807 --> 39:38.874
i was just trying to be

39:39.008 --> 39:39.675
a sheepdog.

39:39.809 --> 39:40.409
ha!

39:40.543 --> 39:41.243
enough wolves in the

39:41.378 --> 39:42.277
world already.

39:49.652 --> 39:50.619
now we were still shooting

39:50.754 --> 39:51.954
on film.

39:52.088 --> 39:53.055
we weren't shooting with digital

39:53.189 --> 39:54.857
cameras yet, but all of the post

39:54.991 --> 39:56.258
processes were starting to fall

39:56.393 --> 39:58.327
into line.

40:00.463 --> 40:01.764
how did you go into

40:01.898 --> 40:04.066
the computer?

40:04.200 --> 40:06.402
so i would have my hand, and

40:06.536 --> 40:07.236
then they would take a picture

40:07.370 --> 40:09.371
of it, and then in a computer,

40:09.506 --> 40:11.273
they would do an animation of,

40:11.408 --> 40:13.709
like, a silver hand, and then

40:13.843 --> 40:14.977
they would show you on a movie

40:15.111 --> 40:15.944
screen.

40:18.081 --> 40:20.349
our experience on the

40:20.483 --> 40:21.884
trilogy- what was really

40:22.018 --> 40:23.552
interesting was that you

40:23.686 --> 40:24.653
realized you were really

40:24.788 --> 40:28.957
creating these images in post.

40:29.092 --> 40:30.192
you couldn't shoot the image,

40:30.326 --> 40:31.860
you were making the image in the

40:31.995 --> 40:33.929
computer.

40:35.899 --> 40:38.767
middle to late '90s, i guess

40:38.902 --> 40:40.269
it's standard- def.

40:40.403 --> 40:41.270
it sounds like it's visual

40:41.404 --> 40:43.906
effects, kind of, was the way to

40:44.040 --> 40:44.573
get in.

40:44.707 --> 40:45.874
we had a problem at i.l.m.

40:46.009 --> 40:46.875
doing our effects.

40:47.010 --> 40:48.811
we had to convert from film to

40:48.945 --> 40:50.279
digital in order to do it.

40:50.413 --> 40:51.413
we could save a huge amount of

40:51.548 --> 40:52.748
money just by not having to

40:52.882 --> 40:54.783
convert anymore.

40:54.918 --> 40:58.053
film is cumbersome, so i just

40:58.188 --> 40:59.488
said, "i'm gonna take my money

40:59.622 --> 41:00.589
and my time.

41:00.723 --> 41:02.424
i'm gonna fix it."

41:02.559 --> 41:05.561
and we went to sony and we said,

41:05.695 --> 41:07.062
"we would like to help you- 

41:07.197 --> 41:07.896
work with you to build

41:08.031 --> 41:10.766
a digital camera."

41:10.900 --> 41:12.301
he was bound and determined

41:12.435 --> 41:14.136
that star wars episode ii was

41:14.270 --> 41:16.104
gonna be shot digitally.

41:16.239 --> 41:17.606
we need to get that all worked

41:17.740 --> 41:18.907
out and get our pipeline

41:19.042 --> 41:21.009
figured out for doing full- on

41:21.144 --> 41:22.277
production with the digital

41:22.412 --> 41:23.912
cameras.

41:24.047 --> 41:25.247
one of the problems with

41:25.381 --> 41:27.149
early digital capture was

41:27.283 --> 41:28.717
resolution.

41:28.852 --> 41:30.586
resolution is dependent on many

41:30.720 --> 41:32.788
factors, but in the most basic

41:32.922 --> 41:34.490
terms, it is the number of

41:34.624 --> 41:36.992
pixels a camera can record.

41:37.126 --> 41:38.694
the more pixels you have, the

41:38.828 --> 41:40.729
higher the resolution and the

41:40.864 --> 41:43.732
more detail an image will have.

41:43.867 --> 41:45.501
a typical standard- definition,

41:45.635 --> 41:48.003
or sd, camera usually had

41:48.137 --> 41:51.340
a resolution of about 720x480

41:51.474 --> 41:53.809
pixels.

41:53.943 --> 41:55.477
really, the turning point was

41:55.612 --> 41:57.212
in the year 2000 when we came

41:57.347 --> 41:59.481
out with the f900 camera, which

41:59.616 --> 42:00.916
was our first high- definition

42:01.050 --> 42:01.650
camera.

42:01.784 --> 42:02.784
before that, whatever you were

42:02.919 --> 42:03.986
looking at really looked like

42:04.120 --> 42:05.287
video.

42:05.421 --> 42:07.022
high- definition cameras

42:07.156 --> 42:08.423
record a resolution of about

42:08.558 --> 42:12.160
1,920 pixels across- 

42:12.295 --> 42:14.863
just under 2k.

42:19.969 --> 42:22.804
in 2002, we did attack of the

42:22.939 --> 42:24.606
clones.

42:24.741 --> 42:26.842
it was the first major feature

42:26.976 --> 42:29.811
that was shot high- definition.

42:31.247 --> 42:32.681
what george did on the

42:32.815 --> 42:35.317
star wars movie was take an

42:35.451 --> 42:38.420
experimental hd camera and apply

42:38.555 --> 42:42.090
it to a feature- film paradigm.

42:42.225 --> 42:43.225
that was unthinkable at the

42:43.359 --> 42:45.260
time.

42:45.395 --> 42:46.695
it meant that he went around the

42:46.829 --> 42:48.497
entire film community, but it

42:48.631 --> 42:49.898
more deeply meant that he went

42:50.033 --> 42:51.567
around film itself.

42:51.701 --> 42:53.902
it became a really, really

42:54.037 --> 42:55.470
polarizing time for a lot of

42:55.605 --> 42:56.405
people in hollywood.

42:56.539 --> 42:57.105
they got up and had a big

42:57.240 --> 42:58.574
meeting, saying that i was the

42:58.708 --> 43:00.342
devil incarnate, that i was

43:00.476 --> 43:01.343
gonna destroy the industry, that

43:01.477 --> 43:02.477
i was gonna destroy all their

43:02.612 --> 43:05.347
jobs, that this is inferior,

43:05.481 --> 43:07.015
that he says he shot attack of

43:07.150 --> 43:07.816
the clones digitally, but he

43:07.951 --> 43:08.483
didn't.

43:08.618 --> 43:09.751
we have word that he actually

43:09.886 --> 43:11.153
used film cameras, that he's not

43:11.287 --> 43:12.020
shooting digital.

43:12.155 --> 43:14.089
he's lying to everybody.

43:14.857 --> 43:15.958
when the f900 came out,

43:16.092 --> 43:16.792
i thought, "the images on that

43:16.926 --> 43:19.528
are just truly appalling."

43:19.662 --> 43:20.829
i don't think that was

43:20.964 --> 43:23.031
a cinematic camera at all.

43:23.166 --> 43:24.900
the early years, i didn't

43:25.034 --> 43:27.069
feel that digital capture or

43:27.203 --> 43:28.470
digital reproduction was the

43:28.605 --> 43:29.271
same.

43:29.405 --> 43:30.405
they would always say, "see, you

43:30.540 --> 43:32.007
can't tell the difference,"

43:32.141 --> 43:34.610
and i could tell the difference.

43:34.744 --> 43:35.777
we'll be the first to admit

43:35.912 --> 43:37.713
that the f900 wasn't designed

43:37.847 --> 43:39.648
like a film camera.

43:39.782 --> 43:40.983
of course, george lucas said

43:41.117 --> 43:42.484
after he shot star wars that he

43:42.619 --> 43:44.386
wouldn't shoot another film on

43:44.520 --> 43:45.687
film again.

43:45.822 --> 43:47.155
and that created, you know,

43:47.290 --> 43:49.324
quite an uproar in hollywood.

43:49.459 --> 43:50.592
digital technology and

43:50.727 --> 43:52.728
digital cameras looked like

43:52.862 --> 43:55.597
a threat to people's existence

43:55.732 --> 43:57.733
and way of thinking and way of

43:57.867 --> 43:58.834
working.

43:58.968 --> 44:00.902
filmmaking is an art, and to

44:01.037 --> 44:02.537
the traditional filmmaker,

44:02.672 --> 44:04.606
it looked like we were messing

44:04.741 --> 44:05.741
around with art.

44:05.875 --> 44:06.608
you know, they would say,

44:06.743 --> 44:08.043
"why are you going backwards?"

44:08.177 --> 44:09.177
you know?

44:09.312 --> 44:10.112
but there's a lot to be said

44:10.246 --> 44:12.080
about the necessity to kind of

44:12.215 --> 44:13.382
lean back to be able to

44:13.516 --> 44:15.050
spring forward.

44:15.184 --> 44:16.218
see, i remember george lucas

44:16.352 --> 44:17.586
pulling together everybody about

44:17.720 --> 44:19.054
ten years ago at a conference he

44:19.188 --> 44:20.622
gave at the ranch up in

44:20.757 --> 44:22.157
san francisco,

44:22.291 --> 44:26.194
and when objections arose about

44:26.329 --> 44:30.399
the idea that digital will put

44:30.533 --> 44:31.199
an end to the art of

44:31.334 --> 44:33.201
cinematography, he pointed out

44:33.336 --> 44:35.704
it's just another tool,

44:35.838 --> 44:36.805
and this is true.

44:36.939 --> 44:38.040
when people saw george

44:38.174 --> 44:39.341
lucas's tests- they said,

44:39.475 --> 44:41.109
"that's- that's- no, that's not

44:41.244 --> 44:42.144
gonna work."

44:42.278 --> 44:43.645
it was that same sort of

44:43.780 --> 44:44.913
closed- minded, "we're gonna wait

44:45.048 --> 44:45.714
ten years to adopt this."

44:45.848 --> 44:46.982
i wasn't gonna wait that long.

44:47.116 --> 44:47.849
i said, "i'm following obi wan.

44:47.984 --> 44:48.717
obi wan knows what he's talking

44:48.851 --> 44:49.384
about.

44:49.519 --> 44:50.318
he knows what time it is.

44:50.453 --> 44:51.219
he always does.

44:51.354 --> 44:53.255
i can tell that this is gonna be

44:53.389 --> 44:55.257
the beginning of something big,

44:55.391 --> 44:56.091
and i want to be there for

44:56.225 --> 44:56.792
that."

44:56.926 --> 44:58.460
but the image sucked.

44:58.594 --> 45:00.295
the image wasn't bad, but the

45:00.430 --> 45:02.130
image wasn't as good as film.

45:02.265 --> 45:04.299
but it allowed me to do

45:04.434 --> 45:05.100
something you could not have

45:05.234 --> 45:07.169
done on film.

45:08.237 --> 45:10.238
i picked up my sin city book,

45:10.373 --> 45:11.106
and i went, "i know how to do

45:11.240 --> 45:11.773
this now.

45:11.908 --> 45:13.875
my god, if i shoot this digital,

45:14.010 --> 45:14.910
i can make it look just like

45:15.044 --> 45:15.577
this book."

45:15.712 --> 45:18.046
the night is hot as hell.

45:18.181 --> 45:20.482
i'm staring at a goddess.

45:20.616 --> 45:22.517
she's telling me she wants me.

45:22.652 --> 45:23.819
sin citywould not exist if

45:23.953 --> 45:24.720
i had shot that on film.

45:24.854 --> 45:25.654
i couldn't have- i wouldn't have

45:25.788 --> 45:27.689
even thought to do it.

45:27.824 --> 45:29.691
i was able to do things that

45:29.826 --> 45:31.159
pushed the art form.

45:31.294 --> 45:32.661
technology pushes the art, and

45:32.795 --> 45:35.363
art pushes technology.

45:35.498 --> 45:36.164
when sin city came out, it hit

45:36.299 --> 45:37.399
people like a brick in the head

45:37.533 --> 45:38.567
'cause they had no idea what

45:38.701 --> 45:39.634
they were looking at.

45:39.769 --> 45:41.536
instead of hiding from it under

45:41.671 --> 45:43.472
a rock and hoping it goes away,

45:43.606 --> 45:45.207
you ended up doing something

45:45.341 --> 45:46.742
that people then realized was

45:46.876 --> 45:47.509
possible.

45:48.911 --> 45:49.911
you know, i was just so amazed- 

45:50.046 --> 45:51.613
the richness that it had.

45:51.748 --> 45:52.714
i didn't know it was even

45:52.849 --> 45:54.483
possible, but the systems got

45:54.617 --> 45:55.817
better for color timing it and

45:55.952 --> 45:57.886
for working in that color space.

46:03.192 --> 46:04.760
after the movie is shot,

46:04.894 --> 46:07.362
edited, and vfx have been added,

46:07.497 --> 46:08.997
a colorist or color timer at the

46:09.132 --> 46:10.632
lab makes adjustments to the

46:10.767 --> 46:13.001
look of the movie.

46:13.136 --> 46:14.569
in the traditional photochemical

46:14.704 --> 46:16.171
method, the negative is

46:16.305 --> 46:18.774
developed, and a print is made.

46:18.908 --> 46:20.642
timing goes back to the days

46:20.777 --> 46:21.943
when, you know, there was only

46:22.078 --> 46:23.245
black and white.

46:23.379 --> 46:24.780
these scenes show the

46:24.914 --> 46:26.348
darkroom operations of the

46:26.482 --> 46:28.183
laboratory in the old days.

46:28.317 --> 46:30.352
the guy that had my job, he

46:30.486 --> 46:31.987
used to look at the negative and

46:32.121 --> 46:34.456
decide how long it would have to

46:34.590 --> 46:36.391
stay in the bath.

46:36.526 --> 46:38.593
if at first it wasn't right,

46:38.728 --> 46:40.862
dunk, dunk again.

46:40.997 --> 46:42.697
so it was time.

46:42.832 --> 46:45.267
it was time- related.

46:45.401 --> 46:46.434
with the advent of color

46:46.569 --> 46:48.436
film, the timers became more

46:48.571 --> 46:49.671
involved in the creative

46:49.806 --> 46:51.740
process.

46:53.509 --> 46:55.043
at the lab, the color timer,

46:55.178 --> 46:56.912
dp, and director determined the

46:57.046 --> 46:58.713
look for the final prints that

46:58.848 --> 47:00.081
will be seen by the public in

47:00.216 --> 47:02.984
the theaters.

47:03.119 --> 47:04.419
the only adjustments that can be

47:04.554 --> 47:06.621
made photochemically are color

47:06.756 --> 47:08.924
balance between red, green,

47:09.058 --> 47:11.560
blue, and brightness.

47:11.694 --> 47:13.495
our job, basically, is to

47:13.629 --> 47:15.664
achieve the vision of the

47:15.798 --> 47:17.165
director and the director of

47:17.300 --> 47:20.068
photography and make it happen

47:20.203 --> 47:22.137
on a piece of film.

47:22.271 --> 47:23.071
like, i would sit with the

47:23.206 --> 47:24.172
director or the director of

47:24.307 --> 47:25.407
photography, and they would say,

47:25.541 --> 47:26.608
"that looks a little bit too red

47:26.742 --> 47:29.878
to me" or "too blue," and we

47:30.012 --> 47:31.813
would manipulate it in our mind

47:31.948 --> 47:36.251
as to how much to change it or

47:36.385 --> 47:38.153
to make different cuts balance

47:38.287 --> 47:39.054
with each other.

47:40.389 --> 47:42.090
well, the timers on the film,

47:42.225 --> 47:43.325
they got to deal with pretty

47:43.459 --> 47:44.593
much from the head, you know,

47:44.727 --> 47:45.861
by the intuition, you know.

47:45.995 --> 47:46.862
yeah.

47:46.996 --> 47:47.863
it was hard.

47:47.997 --> 47:49.497
it was very hard.

47:49.632 --> 47:52.767
so, you know, there was a lot of

47:52.902 --> 47:54.469
art and labor involved in it.

47:54.604 --> 47:55.737
you know, those people really

47:55.872 --> 47:57.806
work hard to achieve that.

47:59.242 --> 48:00.909
i still found it very, very

48:01.043 --> 48:03.111
frustrating, the timing

48:03.246 --> 48:05.380
process- that you're kind of

48:05.514 --> 48:06.615
talking over the thing while

48:06.749 --> 48:07.883
it's running and trying to keep

48:08.017 --> 48:09.317
up with the cuts and saying,

48:09.452 --> 48:10.018
"i don't know.

48:10.152 --> 48:11.286
that looked a little cyan

48:11.420 --> 48:12.287
to me," or something, and the

48:12.421 --> 48:13.121
guy is, like, trying to write

48:13.256 --> 48:15.357
it down- write the footage down

48:15.491 --> 48:16.291
as it goes by, and you can't

48:16.425 --> 48:19.027
stop and- that just seemed crazy

48:19.161 --> 48:19.694
to me.

48:23.032 --> 48:24.399
digital color correction

48:24.533 --> 48:26.134
tools were first used for

48:26.269 --> 48:27.636
shorter pieces such as

48:27.770 --> 48:29.838
commercials and music videos.

48:29.972 --> 48:31.006
i used to do tons of

48:31.140 --> 48:33.074
music videos, and we came up

48:33.209 --> 48:37.178
with some of the craziest and,

48:37.313 --> 48:39.314
i think, groundbreaking visual

48:39.448 --> 48:41.116
images,

48:41.250 --> 48:43.485
and it was just an amazing

48:43.619 --> 48:44.986
ability to come into a room like

48:45.121 --> 48:48.156
this and manipulate something to

48:48.291 --> 48:50.458
create images that people had

48:50.593 --> 48:52.961
never seen before.

48:55.665 --> 48:56.798
digital color correction

48:56.933 --> 48:58.300
began replacing traditional

48:58.434 --> 49:00.168
photochemical methods of color

49:00.303 --> 49:02.170
timing.

49:02.305 --> 49:03.905
my job is to be able to make

49:04.106 --> 49:06.308
sure that the creatives get

49:06.442 --> 49:07.175
everything that they want,

49:07.310 --> 49:08.510
so the cinematographer gets

49:08.644 --> 49:09.878
a palette or the contrast that

49:10.012 --> 49:10.812
he wants, and, of course, the

49:10.947 --> 49:12.247
director gets the feeling that

49:12.381 --> 49:13.848
he wants throughout the movie,

49:13.983 --> 49:14.649
and make sure that we can see

49:14.784 --> 49:16.184
all the actors' eyes and see all

49:16.319 --> 49:17.352
of the emotion that he wants to

49:17.486 --> 49:19.220
see.

49:19.355 --> 49:21.389
i can now start building what we

49:21.524 --> 49:22.891
call "power windows."

49:23.025 --> 49:26.394
in a power window, i can change

49:26.529 --> 49:28.129
any kind of hue i want.

49:28.264 --> 49:30.632
if i just want those trees over

49:30.766 --> 49:33.868
on the left, i can pick the

49:34.003 --> 49:37.505
color that i want of those trees

49:37.640 --> 49:39.874
and i can isolate it.

49:40.009 --> 49:42.577
now i can change those trees to

49:42.712 --> 49:44.746
any color i want.

49:44.880 --> 49:45.947
the cinematographer and the

49:46.082 --> 49:47.549
director come in and we spend

49:47.683 --> 49:49.351
a couple weeks grading the film

49:49.485 --> 49:50.485
and giving it that look, you

49:50.619 --> 49:51.319
know, to make it look

49:51.454 --> 49:53.088
beautiful- however they want it

49:53.222 --> 49:54.689
to look.

49:54.824 --> 49:55.790
i have this great feeling that

49:55.925 --> 49:57.392
i can do just about anything you

49:57.526 --> 49:59.160
ask me to do within reason.

49:59.295 --> 50:01.696
who invented this process?

50:01.831 --> 50:02.564
you know, it was the same

50:02.698 --> 50:03.465
technology that people used for

50:03.599 --> 50:04.833
music videos to create all those

50:04.967 --> 50:05.633
cool looks.

50:05.768 --> 50:07.969
and, basically, what happened is

50:08.104 --> 50:09.070
over the last, whatever, ten

50:09.205 --> 50:11.106
years, it's just evolved to

50:11.240 --> 50:13.174
become a lot more streamlined.

50:15.277 --> 50:16.311
o brother, where art thou? was

50:16.445 --> 50:18.046
really the first movie where

50:18.180 --> 50:19.547
basically every single frame

50:19.682 --> 50:20.382
was a visual effect.

50:20.516 --> 50:22.584
so it was all color timed

50:22.718 --> 50:24.853
digitally for the look.

50:24.987 --> 50:26.287
so it was the first d.i.

50:26.422 --> 50:28.123
it was just kind of- you know,

50:28.257 --> 50:29.324
roger deakins is sittin' in the

50:29.458 --> 50:31.326
room saying, "i can't get what

50:31.460 --> 50:33.194
i want in photochemical because

50:33.329 --> 50:34.796
every time i color time it this

50:34.930 --> 50:36.297
nice golden color, i lose all

50:36.432 --> 50:37.132
my blue skies.

50:37.266 --> 50:38.133
what am i gonna do?"

50:38.267 --> 50:39.334
it seems a little bit yellow,

50:39.468 --> 50:40.001
doesn't it?

50:40.136 --> 50:40.869
oh, yeah, the trees were

50:41.003 --> 50:42.103
a little bit more brown.

50:42.238 --> 50:43.071
so he came in and did

50:43.205 --> 50:44.539
testing- actually, i got to sit

50:44.673 --> 50:45.740
with him and showed him,

50:45.875 --> 50:47.175
"okay, we can key it.

50:47.309 --> 50:48.910
what we can do is, we can

50:49.045 --> 50:50.378
basically affect everything in

50:50.513 --> 50:52.247
the image except for the blue in

50:52.381 --> 50:52.947
the sky."

50:53.082 --> 50:53.615
and also, they were

50:53.749 --> 50:54.816
wearing overalls, all right, so

50:54.950 --> 50:56.418
the blue in the wardrobe.

50:56.552 --> 50:57.685
but everything else, like the

50:57.820 --> 50:59.120
green trees that are not in the

50:59.255 --> 51:00.555
palette that you want, we can

51:00.689 --> 51:01.556
desaturate them and make them

51:01.690 --> 51:02.323
brown- gold."

51:05.828 --> 51:07.729
so out of necessity of the

51:07.863 --> 51:10.498
look for the movie and then

51:10.633 --> 51:11.666
other people kind of catching

51:11.801 --> 51:13.001
on, saying, "ooh, i could use

51:13.135 --> 51:15.170
that in- " you know?

51:15.304 --> 51:16.871
it just became, you know, more

51:17.006 --> 51:17.839
and more popular.

51:17.973 --> 51:19.407
timing is a very frustrating

51:19.542 --> 51:20.675
process on photochemical.

51:20.810 --> 51:21.910
it's just very crude.

51:22.044 --> 51:23.111
it's very- you can hardly do

51:23.245 --> 51:23.978
anything.

51:24.113 --> 51:24.879
that's the whole thing about

51:25.014 --> 51:25.580
d.i.

51:25.714 --> 51:26.915
when i could go in and circle

51:27.049 --> 51:28.349
little things and make a face a

51:28.484 --> 51:31.019
little bit redder and, you know,

51:31.153 --> 51:32.220
bring out the background or

51:32.354 --> 51:33.521
bring- i just was in heaven.

51:33.656 --> 51:34.522
i said, "this is amazing.

51:34.657 --> 51:35.657
i can do anything to fix this

51:35.791 --> 51:36.324
movie."

51:36.459 --> 51:37.425
and what i find interesting

51:37.560 --> 51:39.761
now looking back to the

51:39.895 --> 51:42.564
beginning experimentation of

51:42.698 --> 51:43.998
a lot of cinematographers like

51:44.133 --> 51:46.634
myself, going from a film

51:46.769 --> 51:49.471
original into the digital world,

51:49.605 --> 51:51.139
seeking more control over the

51:51.273 --> 51:52.407
image and being able to

51:52.541 --> 51:54.309
manipulate the image more, is

51:54.443 --> 51:55.944
that now, we actually have less

51:56.078 --> 51:59.614
control because we then give

51:59.748 --> 52:01.249
away our negative or give away

52:01.383 --> 52:02.283
our product.

52:02.418 --> 52:03.818
anybody can take it after that

52:03.953 --> 52:06.087
and can manipulate it.

52:06.222 --> 52:07.055
the colorist is a really

52:07.189 --> 52:09.390
important aspect of the final

52:09.525 --> 52:10.859
product.

52:10.993 --> 52:12.127
i'm the one that's pushing these

52:12.261 --> 52:14.028
buttons to make your film look

52:14.163 --> 52:15.163
a certain way.

52:15.297 --> 52:16.464
yes, i'm getting the direction,

52:16.599 --> 52:18.066
but it's a lot of my own

52:18.200 --> 52:19.901
intuitiveness to crank that

52:20.035 --> 52:21.302
a certain amount and to push

52:21.437 --> 52:23.271
that into a certain direction.

52:23.405 --> 52:25.340
so i'm kind of like the last

52:25.474 --> 52:26.274
person that really gets to

52:26.408 --> 52:26.941
touch it.

52:27.076 --> 52:28.743
it started off as being very

52:28.878 --> 52:29.811
adversarial between

52:29.945 --> 52:31.212
cinematographers and colorists

52:31.347 --> 52:32.380
because it was like, "oh, well,

52:32.515 --> 52:33.381
he shouldn't be determining

52:33.516 --> 52:34.482
what the look of the film is.

52:34.617 --> 52:35.350
i do that."

52:35.484 --> 52:36.451
the beauty of these projects

52:36.585 --> 52:38.319
these days is, it's a team.

52:38.454 --> 52:40.088
i think it could take power

52:40.222 --> 52:41.289
away from the dp, but i think

52:41.423 --> 52:43.591
it's your job as a

52:43.726 --> 52:45.960
cinematographer to try your best

52:46.095 --> 52:46.895
to see it through to the end,

52:47.029 --> 52:48.530
and i think they would do

52:48.664 --> 52:49.531
everything in their power to

52:49.665 --> 52:50.665
make sure they're present at the

52:50.799 --> 52:52.634
d.i. and that they supervise

52:52.768 --> 52:54.202
that so that their vision that

52:54.336 --> 52:55.036
they originally intended was

52:55.171 --> 52:55.703
executed.

52:55.838 --> 52:57.238
on the gangs of new york,

52:57.373 --> 53:01.976
they offered me to do a d.i,

53:02.111 --> 53:04.846
but because everything was

53:04.980 --> 53:07.348
built for us, what we had on

53:07.483 --> 53:08.616
screen was exactly what we

53:08.751 --> 53:09.684
wanted.

53:09.818 --> 53:12.687
we didn't have to have a d.i.

53:12.821 --> 53:16.090
to change everything.

53:16.225 --> 53:17.425
what i'm trying always to do

53:17.560 --> 53:18.893
with- in camera

53:19.028 --> 53:20.061
and with lighting and

53:20.196 --> 53:22.497
with filters and with lenses

53:22.631 --> 53:25.166
but not later in the d.i.

53:25.301 --> 53:27.202
okay, if you have a special

53:27.336 --> 53:30.305
story where you need to change

53:30.439 --> 53:32.540
the reality, then a d.i. is

53:32.675 --> 53:34.008
something wonderful, because you

53:34.143 --> 53:35.810
can do whatever you want with

53:35.945 --> 53:37.812
the image, which can be great,

53:37.947 --> 53:39.881
which can be wonderful.

53:40.983 --> 53:42.217
once we get done digitally

53:42.351 --> 53:43.785
color- correcting your movie,

53:43.919 --> 53:45.486
we make a brand new negative and

53:45.621 --> 53:46.487
then make a print of that

53:46.622 --> 53:47.655
negative.

53:47.790 --> 53:49.123
then we look at the print versus

53:49.258 --> 53:50.558
the data in a side- by- side

53:50.693 --> 53:52.627
fashion.

53:54.430 --> 53:56.030
and then we dial in the print to

53:56.165 --> 53:59.400
match the data to make the print

53:59.535 --> 54:02.270
look exactly the way it should.

54:05.274 --> 54:07.108
how do you feel about- when

54:07.243 --> 54:08.409
you do all of this work and you

54:08.544 --> 54:10.378
have it pristine and you're

54:10.512 --> 54:11.713
gonna have some prints that are

54:11.847 --> 54:14.616
perfect and then some prints- 

54:14.750 --> 54:15.583
i mean, do you have to kind of

54:15.718 --> 54:17.585
let it go once you create it?

54:17.720 --> 54:18.586
honestly, the truth of the

54:18.721 --> 54:19.787
matter is, is that when you go

54:19.922 --> 54:21.356
to a theater and you watch that

54:21.490 --> 54:22.757
print that you spent weeks

54:22.891 --> 54:24.726
laboring on, every theater looks

54:24.860 --> 54:26.361
different.

54:26.495 --> 54:27.996
they have the luminance on their

54:28.130 --> 54:29.530
projector at a different level

54:29.665 --> 54:30.665
or, you know, there's so many

54:30.799 --> 54:32.200
variables.

54:32.334 --> 54:33.534
the real auteur, ultimately,

54:33.669 --> 54:34.535
of a picture, if you want to use

54:34.670 --> 54:36.571
the word, is the projectionist.

54:36.705 --> 54:38.106
the sound can be loud or low,

54:38.240 --> 54:38.806
you can see the head of the

54:38.941 --> 54:40.508
actor or not 'cause he can

54:40.643 --> 54:42.744
frame you out 'cause he's busy.

54:42.878 --> 54:43.645
he's got things to do.

54:45.014 --> 54:46.114
you know, a film will come up

54:46.248 --> 54:47.115
and one reel will be blue;

54:47.249 --> 54:47.849
another reel will be brown

54:47.983 --> 54:48.916
because of the projector light,

54:49.051 --> 54:49.584
you know.

54:49.718 --> 54:51.019
but we got to enjoy that.

54:51.153 --> 54:51.753
i thought it was part of the

54:51.887 --> 54:52.420
film.

54:52.554 --> 54:53.588
it's always a huge

54:53.722 --> 54:55.890
disappointment now for me to see

54:56.025 --> 54:56.724
a film print.

54:56.859 --> 54:58.159
like, it's depressing.

54:58.294 --> 54:59.994
it's not sharp.

55:00.129 --> 55:01.629
it doesn't have any snap.

55:01.764 --> 55:02.830
it's shaking.

55:02.965 --> 55:03.831
it's dirty.

55:03.966 --> 55:06.267
i hate it.

55:06.402 --> 55:07.802
i put in a tremendous amount

55:07.936 --> 55:11.105
of effort to make my images the

55:11.240 --> 55:13.808
way i have them in mind, and

55:13.942 --> 55:16.577
i create them, and i have them

55:16.712 --> 55:18.079
on the finished product in the

55:18.213 --> 55:18.746
camera.

55:18.881 --> 55:20.682
but what happens afterwards?

55:20.816 --> 55:21.783
the quality of film is

55:21.917 --> 55:23.918
terrible in a theater, and

55:24.053 --> 55:25.186
anybody in hollywood, they say,

55:25.321 --> 55:26.788
"oh, it's not that bad a camera.

55:26.922 --> 55:27.655
no, it's not that"-  they never

55:27.790 --> 55:28.656
go into a theater and see it in

55:28.791 --> 55:29.424
a real theater.

55:29.558 --> 55:30.825
titanic played so long in

55:30.959 --> 55:33.361
theaters that we actually just- 

55:33.495 --> 55:35.463
our prints fell apart.

55:35.597 --> 55:36.798
they literally just dropped out

55:36.932 --> 55:38.966
of the projectors in pieces.

55:39.101 --> 55:40.568
so we were struggling to try

55:40.703 --> 55:41.636
to get quality into the

55:41.770 --> 55:44.605
theaters, and out of that came

55:44.740 --> 55:47.175
the fact that if it was digital,

55:47.309 --> 55:48.776
you'd have a brilliant thing.

55:48.911 --> 55:49.844
you wouldn't have scratches.

55:49.978 --> 55:50.745
you wouldn't have tears.

55:50.879 --> 55:52.113
hype surrounding this movie

55:52.247 --> 55:52.947
has been overwhelming.

55:53.082 --> 55:54.982
in 1999, we were able to

55:55.117 --> 55:56.417
project phantom menace

55:56.552 --> 55:57.552
digitally.

55:57.686 --> 55:58.886
we had two theaters in new york,

55:59.021 --> 56:00.755
two theaters in l.a., and that

56:00.889 --> 56:03.091
was the first time that a major

56:03.225 --> 56:04.125
hollywood movie had been

56:04.259 --> 56:05.326
projected digitally.

56:05.461 --> 56:06.494
there were actually four

56:06.628 --> 56:07.495
digital projectors in the

56:07.629 --> 56:11.299
country- just four- in '99.

56:11.433 --> 56:15.470
by 2002, there were still only

56:15.604 --> 56:17.205
150.

56:17.339 --> 56:19.540
the post flow was already there.

56:19.675 --> 56:20.775
it was all digital,

56:20.909 --> 56:21.943
and the rest of the industry was

56:22.077 --> 56:22.677
going there.

56:22.811 --> 56:23.978
sound had already gone there.

56:24.113 --> 56:25.113
editorial had gone there.

56:25.247 --> 56:27.048
editorial was- yeah.

56:27.182 --> 56:29.317
the camera was lagging behind,

56:29.451 --> 56:31.386
you know?

56:33.255 --> 56:34.555
new companies began to

56:34.690 --> 56:36.724
develop high- definition cameras,

56:36.859 --> 56:38.059
and other hollywood films

56:38.193 --> 56:41.863
followed lucas's lead.

56:41.997 --> 56:43.798
michael mann's collateral used

56:43.932 --> 56:46.000
the thomson viper, an hd camera

56:46.135 --> 56:47.368
that outperformed film at

56:47.503 --> 56:50.238
shooting in dark environments.

56:51.306 --> 56:52.507
michael wanted to see into

56:52.641 --> 56:55.777
the night.

56:55.911 --> 56:57.078
and that, at that point, was

56:57.212 --> 56:59.680
really, you know, best done with

56:59.815 --> 57:01.916
these digital cameras tweaked up

57:02.050 --> 57:04.185
and pushed till we sort of

57:04.319 --> 57:06.387
pushed the boundaries of what

57:06.522 --> 57:09.290
the digital was capable of.

57:09.425 --> 57:10.625
collateral was interesting in

57:10.759 --> 57:13.261
that it was supposed to look

57:13.395 --> 57:15.329
exactly the way it looked.

57:18.434 --> 57:20.368
when you look outside at night,

57:20.502 --> 57:22.336
you don't see black night.

57:22.471 --> 57:24.972
you see an aura around the city

57:25.107 --> 57:27.909
of green and magenta and purple

57:28.043 --> 57:29.277
lights, and there's this, like,

57:29.411 --> 57:30.812
haze in the sky, and you just

57:30.946 --> 57:31.779
see all these crazy colors.

57:31.914 --> 57:33.414
and the only way to really

57:33.549 --> 57:34.949
capture that, at that time,

57:35.083 --> 57:38.419
was digitally.

57:38.554 --> 57:39.220
you've got a lot of sort of

57:39.354 --> 57:40.588
nighttime photography going on

57:40.722 --> 57:43.357
now that's using the different

57:43.492 --> 57:44.826
sensitivity of, you know,

57:44.960 --> 57:46.194
ccd chips.

57:46.328 --> 57:47.295
they see a little more of the

57:47.429 --> 57:48.396
u.v. spectrum.

57:48.530 --> 57:50.097
so you've got filmmakers trying

57:50.232 --> 57:51.999
to use that to give a different

57:52.134 --> 57:53.601
aesthetic to nighttime lighting,

57:53.735 --> 57:55.036
but to me, it's still, at the

57:55.170 --> 57:56.003
moment, retaining that

57:56.138 --> 57:57.505
flavor of video.

57:57.639 --> 57:59.373
the viper was the first

57:59.508 --> 58:02.577
camera that really told me that

58:02.711 --> 58:04.612
the digital age was ratcheting

58:04.746 --> 58:07.448
up in intensity, and i could see

58:07.583 --> 58:09.784
the footrace in cameras coming.

58:11.420 --> 58:14.689
in 2005, panavision, an

58:14.823 --> 58:16.257
established force in the film

58:16.391 --> 58:18.559
camera business, made a serious

58:18.694 --> 58:20.294
push into digital with a large

58:20.429 --> 58:22.930
sensor single- chip camera.

58:23.065 --> 58:24.532
we started looking at this as

58:24.666 --> 58:27.401
a real format, and we decided

58:27.536 --> 58:30.338
that the best thing we can do is

58:30.472 --> 58:32.240
design what i like to call

58:32.374 --> 58:34.575
"a film camera that takes tape."

58:34.710 --> 58:36.677
and that's when we started

58:36.812 --> 58:39.247
drawing out the genesis.

58:39.381 --> 58:40.948
genesis is a full- frame,

58:41.083 --> 58:44.218
35- millimeter chip that allows

58:44.353 --> 58:45.520
depth of field to be very

58:45.654 --> 58:50.024
similar to film, and we could

58:50.158 --> 58:51.392
use all of our 35- millimeter

58:51.527 --> 58:53.427
lenses, which totaled in the

58:53.562 --> 58:55.162
thousands, literally.

58:55.297 --> 58:55.897
and we went to work- 

58:56.031 --> 58:58.199
partnered up with sony on it.

58:58.333 --> 59:00.067
they designed the electronics

59:00.202 --> 59:01.769
and we put it together.

59:01.904 --> 59:03.104
and we introduced the first

59:03.238 --> 59:05.973
full- frame digital camera for

59:06.108 --> 59:07.708
making feature films.

59:07.843 --> 59:08.943
the genesis was hyped to hell

59:09.077 --> 59:10.511
because it was from panavision,

59:10.646 --> 59:12.046
and it was sony designing

59:12.180 --> 59:13.481
a system for panavision.

59:13.615 --> 59:16.217
the good about it was, it took

59:16.351 --> 59:17.718
panavision lenses.

59:17.853 --> 59:19.987
it was a 35- mil- size sensor,

59:20.122 --> 59:21.455
and of course, the viper had

59:21.590 --> 59:24.425
been a small 2/3 inch sensor.

59:24.560 --> 59:25.793
people wanted the same depth of

59:25.928 --> 59:26.861
field and the same look that

59:26.995 --> 59:28.396
they got with 35 mil, which, of

59:28.530 --> 59:29.230
course, is what you got with

59:29.364 --> 59:29.997
the genesis,

59:30.132 --> 59:32.500
and it gave pretty good images.

59:32.634 --> 59:33.801
we were very careful to

59:33.936 --> 59:36.671
design it for film crews so that

59:36.805 --> 59:38.706
the transition- if there was

59:38.840 --> 59:40.808
going to be one- would be easy

59:40.943 --> 59:43.010
for the people making movies.

59:43.145 --> 59:44.378
dean semler, who was an

59:44.513 --> 59:45.313
academy award- winning

59:45.447 --> 59:46.714
cinematographer for dances with

59:46.848 --> 59:49.584
wolves, shot apocalypto down in

59:49.718 --> 59:51.252
mexico, where the temperature

59:51.386 --> 59:53.087
was 100 degrees and the humidity

59:53.221 --> 59:55.923
was 200, and never had a second

59:56.058 --> 59:56.591
of downtime.

59:56.725 --> 59:58.092
he felt that it was like a film

59:58.226 --> 01:00:00.795
camera.

01:00:00.929 --> 01:00:03.064
it's 35 pounds.

01:00:03.198 --> 01:00:05.333
the fucking camera is this big,

01:00:05.467 --> 01:00:07.568
and on the top of it, it looks

01:00:07.703 --> 01:00:09.203
like a film magazine.

01:00:09.338 --> 01:00:10.805
the recorder attached to it

01:00:10.939 --> 01:00:12.440
the same way that a mag would

01:00:12.574 --> 01:00:13.608
attach to it- so on the top or

01:00:13.742 --> 01:00:14.275
on the back.

01:00:14.409 --> 01:00:15.509
if i want to see what just

01:00:15.644 --> 01:00:17.511
got shot, does it play back

01:00:17.646 --> 01:00:18.179
off that?

01:00:18.313 --> 01:00:19.046
they said, "no, you would never

01:00:19.181 --> 01:00:19.714
touch that.

01:00:19.848 --> 01:00:20.381
it's like your original

01:00:20.515 --> 01:00:21.048
negative."

01:00:21.183 --> 01:00:21.749
i said, "let me see if i got

01:00:21.883 --> 01:00:22.583
this straight: you guys spent

01:00:22.718 --> 01:00:23.851
how many millions of dollars

01:00:23.986 --> 01:00:25.753
developing a camera with sony,

01:00:25.887 --> 01:00:28.723
and i can't play the hd back to

01:00:28.857 --> 01:00:30.191
look at it because that's the

01:00:30.325 --> 01:00:31.025
'negative'?"

01:00:31.159 --> 01:00:31.892
alonzo?

01:00:32.027 --> 01:00:33.828
where we were in '06, '07

01:00:33.962 --> 01:00:36.230
was, we had the color space and

01:00:36.365 --> 01:00:37.531
we had the resolution, but we

01:00:37.666 --> 01:00:38.799
didn't have the dynamic range.

01:00:38.934 --> 01:00:40.167
so you had to be careful.

01:00:40.302 --> 01:00:41.135
you had to be careful on the

01:00:41.269 --> 01:00:41.802
set.

01:00:41.937 --> 01:00:44.071
dynamic range is vital.

01:00:44.206 --> 01:00:45.640
dynamic range is more important

01:00:45.774 --> 01:00:46.641
than anything for me.

01:00:46.775 --> 01:00:47.708
i mean, that's what really slows

01:00:47.843 --> 01:00:48.409
me down when i'm shooting

01:00:48.543 --> 01:00:49.076
digitally.

01:00:49.211 --> 01:00:51.679
if you have sort of a range

01:00:51.813 --> 01:00:54.015
between dark and bright in film

01:00:54.149 --> 01:00:55.316
like this.

01:00:55.450 --> 01:00:56.984
shooting digital, you don't

01:00:57.119 --> 01:00:59.987
have wide range which film has

01:01:00.122 --> 01:01:01.622
between the blacks and the

01:01:01.757 --> 01:01:02.423
lights.

01:01:02.557 --> 01:01:04.525
so whatever is up here is cut

01:01:04.726 --> 01:01:06.160
off, and whatever is down there

01:01:06.294 --> 01:01:07.261
is also cut off.

01:01:07.396 --> 01:01:08.663
i just don't feel it has

01:01:08.797 --> 01:01:10.965
the latitude that enables me to

01:01:11.099 --> 01:01:12.867
do what i want to do.

01:01:13.001 --> 01:01:14.669
you can't overexpose it by five

01:01:14.803 --> 01:01:16.137
stops and still have something

01:01:16.271 --> 01:01:17.171
in the image.

01:01:17.305 --> 01:01:19.440
you can't underexpose it by four

01:01:19.574 --> 01:01:21.008
stops and have a trace of

01:01:21.143 --> 01:01:22.109
something in the image.

01:01:22.244 --> 01:01:23.277
i think it's fun to play in

01:01:23.412 --> 01:01:25.346
those areas.

01:01:27.015 --> 01:01:30.017
in 2005, jim jannard, the

01:01:30.152 --> 01:01:31.218
founder and owner of the

01:01:31.353 --> 01:01:32.987
multibillion dollar sunglass and

01:01:33.121 --> 01:01:35.456
sports apparel company, oakley,

01:01:35.590 --> 01:01:36.791
set out to create a new

01:01:36.925 --> 01:01:38.693
cinematic and affordable digital

01:01:38.827 --> 01:01:40.161
camera.

01:01:40.295 --> 01:01:43.030
digital wasn't paying enough

01:01:43.165 --> 01:01:45.466
respect to film.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:47.835
it wasn't as good as film,

01:01:47.969 --> 01:01:49.537
and to me, everything in the

01:01:49.671 --> 01:01:50.504
world can and will be made

01:01:50.639 --> 01:01:51.172
better.

01:01:51.306 --> 01:01:52.740
the only question is when and by

01:01:52.874 --> 01:01:54.475
whom.

01:01:54.609 --> 01:01:56.210
there was a technological

01:01:56.344 --> 01:01:58.746
movement towards the eventual

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:00.948
replacement of film.

01:02:01.083 --> 01:02:03.017
what was happening from some of

01:02:03.151 --> 01:02:04.385
the major manufacturers is,

01:02:04.519 --> 01:02:06.420
they were creating video- level

01:02:06.555 --> 01:02:08.289
tools, essentially hd tools,

01:02:08.423 --> 01:02:10.357
and sort of trying to push that

01:02:10.492 --> 01:02:12.059
into the world of cinema,

01:02:12.194 --> 01:02:13.794
and what we saw was that

01:02:13.929 --> 01:02:15.062
that wasn't anywhere close to

01:02:15.197 --> 01:02:16.363
good enough.

01:02:16.498 --> 01:02:17.798
we wanted to set a high

01:02:17.933 --> 01:02:19.333
enough target so that it was

01:02:19.468 --> 01:02:21.335
meaningful.

01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:22.603
that's the nature of red.

01:02:22.738 --> 01:02:25.206
we want to help send film to the

01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:27.341
retirement home and have it feel

01:02:27.476 --> 01:02:30.778
good about what took its place.

01:02:30.912 --> 01:02:33.781
in 2007, the red one was

01:02:33.915 --> 01:02:37.718
available to the public.

01:02:37.853 --> 01:02:39.386
this new generation of digital

01:02:39.521 --> 01:02:40.888
cameras could now shoot more

01:02:41.022 --> 01:02:43.858
resolution than hd, an increase

01:02:43.992 --> 01:02:47.762
in pixels from about 2k to 4k.

01:02:48.964 --> 01:02:50.064
when i saw the red, i really

01:02:50.198 --> 01:02:51.799
felt i should call film on the

01:02:51.933 --> 01:02:52.767
phone and say, "i've met

01:02:52.901 --> 01:02:54.568
someone," 'cause i really

01:02:54.703 --> 01:02:56.170
thought, "this is- okay, this is

01:02:56.304 --> 01:02:58.773
the future."

01:02:58.907 --> 01:03:01.175
the resolution, the curve,

01:03:01.309 --> 01:03:02.977
the way it saw light- i just

01:03:03.111 --> 01:03:04.545
felt, "this is the new thing"

01:03:04.679 --> 01:03:08.282
and was insistent that we shoot

01:03:08.416 --> 01:03:09.183
che on it.

01:03:09.317 --> 01:03:11.418
muchacho.

01:03:11.553 --> 01:03:13.854
digital at the beginning was

01:03:13.989 --> 01:03:14.522
very bad.

01:03:14.656 --> 01:03:16.624
everybody knew that.

01:03:16.758 --> 01:03:18.459
then came the red camera, which

01:03:18.593 --> 01:03:21.529
was a little bit better than

01:03:21.663 --> 01:03:22.930
the previous ones.

01:03:23.064 --> 01:03:24.765
at least it was cheaper.

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:26.066
okay, it's cheap, but it's not

01:03:26.201 --> 01:03:27.434
good enough,

01:03:27.569 --> 01:03:29.703
and i actually experienced the

01:03:29.838 --> 01:03:32.506
limitation of that.

01:03:32.641 --> 01:03:33.374
well, you know, it had

01:03:33.508 --> 01:03:34.041
problems.

01:03:34.176 --> 01:03:35.476
it crashed occasionally, to put

01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:36.143
it mildly.

01:03:36.278 --> 01:03:37.912
it's a computer, but then again,

01:03:38.046 --> 01:03:39.914
red ignored everything about

01:03:40.048 --> 01:03:41.882
normal film camera bodies and

01:03:42.017 --> 01:03:42.850
built what they thought was

01:03:42.984 --> 01:03:44.451
right.

01:03:44.586 --> 01:03:46.353
even with the war stories of

01:03:46.488 --> 01:03:48.589
being out in the heat and having

01:03:48.723 --> 01:03:49.657
ice packs on it and all that

01:03:49.791 --> 01:03:51.992
stuff, none of that bothered me

01:03:52.127 --> 01:03:53.961
because the get was so

01:03:54.095 --> 01:03:55.196
significant.

01:03:55.330 --> 01:03:57.498
in this case, not having to lug

01:03:57.632 --> 01:04:00.201
film magazines up and down this

01:04:00.335 --> 01:04:01.936
ravine for days on end in

01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:03.571
100- degree weather and being

01:04:03.705 --> 01:04:05.739
able to shoot onto a flash card

01:04:05.874 --> 01:04:07.341
and change magazines

01:04:07.475 --> 01:04:09.076
in 15 seconds.

01:04:09.211 --> 01:04:11.245
that alone was huge for us.

01:04:11.379 --> 01:04:13.914
it resulted in a better movie.

01:04:16.918 --> 01:04:17.618
i really love what

01:04:17.752 --> 01:04:18.619
jim jannard's doing.

01:04:18.753 --> 01:04:20.120
i love what that company's

01:04:20.255 --> 01:04:20.821
about, and i love

01:04:20.956 --> 01:04:22.189
the tack that they took.

01:04:22.324 --> 01:04:24.558
it's very much no- holds- barred,

01:04:24.693 --> 01:04:25.759
like, "let's roll up our

01:04:25.894 --> 01:04:27.228
sleeves, let's get in up to our

01:04:27.362 --> 01:04:28.429
eyeballs, and let's figure this

01:04:28.563 --> 01:04:30.331
shit out."

01:04:30.465 --> 01:04:31.832
the red one is 9 pounds,

01:04:31.967 --> 01:04:33.601
and put a lens on it,

01:04:33.735 --> 01:04:35.436
14 pounds.

01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:36.170
on social network,

01:04:36.304 --> 01:04:37.071
i went to him and i said, "i got

01:04:37.205 --> 01:04:39.840
to shoot these tiny boats.

01:04:39.975 --> 01:04:40.674
they're, like, the thickness

01:04:40.809 --> 01:04:43.043
of potato chips, and i can't

01:04:43.178 --> 01:04:45.713
add 13 pounds of camera

01:04:45.847 --> 01:04:46.814
out on the side of this.

01:04:46.948 --> 01:04:47.481
you know, i'll topple

01:04:47.616 --> 01:04:48.382
this boat."

01:04:48.516 --> 01:04:49.283
and he said, "okay, what do you

01:04:49.417 --> 01:04:49.950
want me to do?"

01:04:50.085 --> 01:04:51.619
i said, "you got to take one,

01:04:51.753 --> 01:04:52.753
you got to bore it out, you got

01:04:52.888 --> 01:04:53.520
to- whatever it is you have

01:04:53.655 --> 01:04:54.188
to do.

01:04:54.322 --> 01:04:55.189
you've got to figure out a way.

01:04:55.323 --> 01:04:56.557
you got to give me the indie car

01:04:56.691 --> 01:04:59.860
version of the red one."

01:04:59.995 --> 01:05:02.096
this was on a friday.

01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:03.497
on sunday, he called me and he

01:05:03.632 --> 01:05:04.398
said, "we'll make the bodies

01:05:04.532 --> 01:05:05.532
out of carbon fiber."

01:05:05.667 --> 01:05:06.834
i said, "when can i have it by?"

01:05:06.968 --> 01:05:08.936
he goes, "it's on my desk."

01:05:09.070 --> 01:05:10.537
and i went down and i picked up

01:05:10.672 --> 01:05:11.739
two, and they were 5 pounds- 

01:05:11.873 --> 01:05:13.007
51/2 pounds.

01:05:13.141 --> 01:05:14.575
that never existed before

01:05:14.709 --> 01:05:16.076
with film cameras- this sort of

01:05:16.211 --> 01:05:19.580
immediate call- and- response

01:05:19.714 --> 01:05:20.915
between the people who were

01:05:21.049 --> 01:05:22.082
shooting and the people who were

01:05:22.217 --> 01:05:24.151
creating the cameras.

01:05:26.288 --> 01:05:27.221
i was desperate to make

01:05:27.355 --> 01:05:28.856
something that had all the fresh

01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:29.990
air in it, and of course, when

01:05:30.125 --> 01:05:31.191
you go to india- in mumbai,

01:05:31.326 --> 01:05:32.960
especially- it's got life.

01:05:33.094 --> 01:05:34.695
it's just coming screaming at

01:05:34.829 --> 01:05:36.330
you all the time in every way.

01:05:36.464 --> 01:05:37.531
danny comes with an idea- 

01:05:37.666 --> 01:05:39.166
rage.

01:05:39.301 --> 01:05:39.867
he comes with an idea with

01:05:40.001 --> 01:05:42.636
speed, energy, youth, and that's

01:05:42.771 --> 01:05:43.304
all i really need in

01:05:43.438 --> 01:05:43.971
the script.

01:05:44.105 --> 01:05:45.739
and then running, and that's it,

01:05:45.874 --> 01:05:47.007
and then off we go to india.

01:05:47.142 --> 01:05:48.909
it's just the most wonderful

01:05:49.044 --> 01:05:50.277
place to work for a different

01:05:50.412 --> 01:05:51.278
kind of film, and we wanted

01:05:51.413 --> 01:05:53.314
a camera that would somehow try

01:05:53.448 --> 01:05:54.915
and catch a bit of that.

01:05:55.050 --> 01:05:55.983
it's about finding a camera.

01:05:56.117 --> 01:05:57.851
the task is there.

01:05:57.986 --> 01:05:58.585
it's clear.

01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.421
my job is then to find- with all

01:06:00.555 --> 01:06:02.723
my anarchic and conventional

01:06:02.857 --> 01:06:03.891
experience- i've just got to

01:06:04.025 --> 01:06:05.426
find the tool.

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:06.760
cameras like silicon

01:06:06.895 --> 01:06:09.730
imaging's si- 2k have been able

01:06:09.864 --> 01:06:11.699
to go places and get shots that

01:06:11.833 --> 01:06:13.033
would have been very difficult

01:06:13.168 --> 01:06:15.035
with film or earlier versions of

01:06:15.170 --> 01:06:16.637
high- definition cameras.

01:06:16.771 --> 01:06:18.739
it's a sensor with a computer

01:06:18.873 --> 01:06:20.274
on the back of it.

01:06:20.408 --> 01:06:21.608
so do you make your computer

01:06:21.743 --> 01:06:23.544
look like a film camera, or do

01:06:23.678 --> 01:06:25.512
you say, "oh, to hell with that.

01:06:25.647 --> 01:06:27.047
take this ethernet cable and

01:06:27.182 --> 01:06:28.515
connect it into a laptop.

01:06:28.650 --> 01:06:29.783
and that's what the si camera

01:06:29.918 --> 01:06:30.918
was.

01:06:31.052 --> 01:06:32.052
at that point, there were no

01:06:32.187 --> 01:06:34.021
other cameras small enough, and

01:06:34.155 --> 01:06:35.389
anthony wanted to be able to run

01:06:35.523 --> 01:06:37.191
in the streets and track the

01:06:37.325 --> 01:06:39.293
children as they were running

01:06:39.427 --> 01:06:41.095
and be at the same height level

01:06:41.229 --> 01:06:42.429
as the kids.

01:06:42.564 --> 01:06:45.966
so they took macbook pros and

01:06:46.101 --> 01:06:48.802
put them into a backpack to use

01:06:48.937 --> 01:06:50.738
for their capture and recording

01:06:50.872 --> 01:06:52.706
system.

01:06:52.841 --> 01:06:54.441
film cameras, even when

01:06:54.576 --> 01:06:56.443
they're off the legs or off the

01:06:56.578 --> 01:06:58.312
steadicam or off the crane,

01:06:58.446 --> 01:06:59.279
they're still connected to the

01:06:59.414 --> 01:07:00.414
cameraman's body.

01:07:00.548 --> 01:07:01.348
he's either- well, you know- 

01:07:01.483 --> 01:07:02.383
he's either chasing you down the

01:07:02.517 --> 01:07:04.451
street or he's got it here or

01:07:04.586 --> 01:07:05.586
they turn it round and he runs

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:06.720
backwards and things like that.

01:07:06.855 --> 01:07:08.389
with this- with this si- 2k, you

01:07:08.523 --> 01:07:11.392
could do that.

01:07:11.526 --> 01:07:12.659
it was no longer connected to

01:07:12.794 --> 01:07:13.327
the cameraman's body.

01:07:13.461 --> 01:07:14.395
he could do different things

01:07:14.529 --> 01:07:16.030
with it during the scene,

01:07:16.164 --> 01:07:18.165
literally just improvising

01:07:18.299 --> 01:07:20.267
during the scene.

01:07:26.241 --> 01:07:28.976
in 2009, slumdog millionaire

01:07:29.110 --> 01:07:30.911
won the academy award for best

01:07:31.046 --> 01:07:32.513
cinematography.

01:07:32.647 --> 01:07:34.415
it was the first time the award

01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:36.316
was given to a movie shot almost

01:07:36.451 --> 01:07:38.752
entirely on digital cameras.

01:07:38.887 --> 01:07:40.754
so you're at the academy awards.

01:07:40.889 --> 01:07:42.189
do you feel like that film- 

01:07:42.323 --> 01:07:42.856
yeah.

01:07:42.991 --> 01:07:45.059
did that film make digital

01:07:45.193 --> 01:07:46.326
acceptable in the mainstream

01:07:46.461 --> 01:07:47.094
now?

01:07:47.228 --> 01:07:49.129
the success of slumdog with

01:07:49.264 --> 01:07:49.963
the critics and with the

01:07:50.098 --> 01:07:53.834
audience symbolizes something of

01:07:53.968 --> 01:07:54.501
an epoch.

01:07:54.636 --> 01:07:57.704
it perhaps puts- hammers the

01:07:57.839 --> 01:07:58.705
stake a little bit further into

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:01.508
the ground as far as acceptance

01:08:01.643 --> 01:08:03.177
of digital formats.

01:08:03.311 --> 01:08:03.911
it was the first real

01:08:04.045 --> 01:08:05.279
acknowledgement, on a large

01:08:05.413 --> 01:08:07.047
scale, of digital, and i was

01:08:07.182 --> 01:08:08.449
very pleased for anthony for

01:08:08.583 --> 01:08:10.184
that, because i think he felt

01:08:10.318 --> 01:08:11.985
it was some acknowledgement that

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:13.387
he would never arrive at because

01:08:13.521 --> 01:08:15.355
he'd chosen to specialize so

01:08:15.490 --> 01:08:16.356
much in the digital world.

01:08:16.491 --> 01:08:17.558
you know, that'll be, i think,

01:08:17.692 --> 01:08:18.658
looked back on as, "there you

01:08:18.792 --> 01:08:20.727
go; that was where it changed."

01:08:34.642 --> 01:08:35.843
avatar was gonna be my next

01:08:35.977 --> 01:08:37.176
movie after titanic, so i

01:08:37.312 --> 01:08:38.377
converted into thinking about

01:08:38.513 --> 01:08:40.380
3-  d in '99.

01:08:40.515 --> 01:08:42.149
i knew immediately that the only

01:08:42.283 --> 01:08:43.216
way to shoot 3- d- that the

01:08:43.350 --> 01:08:44.952
future of shooting 3- d was

01:08:45.086 --> 01:08:46.353
digital.

01:08:46.488 --> 01:08:47.488
we were starting to experiment

01:08:47.622 --> 01:08:48.822
with putting two hd cameras

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:50.390
side by side.

01:08:50.524 --> 01:08:51.358
i thought the results were

01:08:51.493 --> 01:08:53.093
pretty cool.

01:08:53.228 --> 01:08:54.595
then vince pace and i built the

01:08:54.729 --> 01:08:56.697
fusion camera system.

01:08:59.834 --> 01:09:00.934
you've decided to put one

01:09:01.069 --> 01:09:03.470
camera here and another camera

01:09:03.604 --> 01:09:04.571
on top.

01:09:04.706 --> 01:09:06.807
and what happens in here, then,

01:09:06.941 --> 01:09:08.375
to marry these two?

01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:09.676
because stereoscopically, you

01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:11.044
need the two images to exist,

01:09:11.179 --> 01:09:11.712
right?

01:09:11.845 --> 01:09:13.180
correct.

01:09:13.314 --> 01:09:14.113
one of the problems that we

01:09:14.249 --> 01:09:15.883
have with the larger cameras is

01:09:16.017 --> 01:09:17.017
the fact that if we were to put

01:09:17.152 --> 01:09:18.352
them side by side- like your two

01:09:18.486 --> 01:09:20.487
eyeballs, right?-  you couldn't

01:09:20.622 --> 01:09:21.955
put those cameras physically in

01:09:22.090 --> 01:09:23.157
that same position.

01:09:23.291 --> 01:09:25.058
they would run into each other.

01:09:25.193 --> 01:09:28.729
so we use a reflective mirror,

01:09:28.863 --> 01:09:30.898
and then that allows us to

01:09:31.032 --> 01:09:32.599
overlay the two camera systems- 

01:09:32.734 --> 01:09:34.268
if you imagine from a physical

01:09:34.402 --> 01:09:36.170
standpoint- where there is no

01:09:36.304 --> 01:09:37.871
limitation on how close we get

01:09:38.006 --> 01:09:39.238
the eyes together,

01:09:39.374 --> 01:09:40.307
and that's really important

01:09:40.441 --> 01:09:42.376
for 3- d.

01:09:43.178 --> 01:09:45.612
to create 3- d, two cameras

01:09:45.747 --> 01:09:47.814
work as a pair, just like our

01:09:47.948 --> 01:09:48.849
two eyes.

01:09:48.983 --> 01:09:50.317
they capture images from

01:09:50.451 --> 01:09:52.185
slightly different angles,

01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:53.353
providing a sense of

01:09:53.488 --> 01:09:54.988
three- dimensional depth and

01:09:55.123 --> 01:09:55.789
distance.

01:09:55.924 --> 01:09:57.024
i have a joke with most of

01:09:57.158 --> 01:09:58.525
the people around me that i long

01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:00.160
for when the world was flat

01:10:00.295 --> 01:10:01.995
because it's not only the camera

01:10:02.130 --> 01:10:03.597
systems duplicate.

01:10:03.731 --> 01:10:05.032
everything duplicates down the

01:10:05.166 --> 01:10:05.766
chain, right?

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:07.601
so lensing, control over

01:10:07.735 --> 01:10:09.036
lensing.

01:10:09.170 --> 01:10:09.870
and a lot of people say, "well,

01:10:10.004 --> 01:10:11.205
then it's twice as hard," and

01:10:11.339 --> 01:10:12.539
that's an incorrect statement.

01:10:12.674 --> 01:10:13.707
it's more than that, because

01:10:13.841 --> 01:10:15.075
these two cameras have to

01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:17.010
operate like siamese twins.

01:10:17.145 --> 01:10:18.679
they have to mimic each other

01:10:18.813 --> 01:10:20.080
perfectly.

01:10:20.215 --> 01:10:21.548
some stereo in here.

01:10:21.683 --> 01:10:22.916
i think when films are done

01:10:23.051 --> 01:10:24.451
right and when it really works

01:10:24.586 --> 01:10:26.386
is when it feels like i'm there,

01:10:26.521 --> 01:10:27.521
i'm in this journey, i'm

01:10:27.655 --> 01:10:29.022
immersed in the story line.

01:10:29.157 --> 01:10:31.225
the fun part for me is to really

01:10:31.359 --> 01:10:33.227
get these tools in the creative

01:10:33.361 --> 01:10:35.295
hands, the people really that

01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:36.496
can take it places where you

01:10:36.631 --> 01:10:38.932
never imagined before.

01:10:39.067 --> 01:10:40.534
avatar came out, and i'm

01:10:40.668 --> 01:10:41.602
really proud of those images.

01:10:41.736 --> 01:10:43.937
they looked gorgeous,

01:10:44.072 --> 01:10:45.906
and it was followed up by

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:47.040
alice in wonderland and

01:10:47.175 --> 01:10:48.442
how to train your dragon.

01:10:48.576 --> 01:10:49.176
boom, boom, boom.

01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:50.644
three films in the marketplace,

01:10:50.778 --> 01:10:51.945
one after another, and all of

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:53.247
them were huge hits.

01:10:53.381 --> 01:10:54.348
the three of them were the top

01:10:54.482 --> 01:10:55.515
grossing films of the year.

01:10:55.650 --> 01:10:58.151
so all of a sudden, you know,

01:10:58.286 --> 01:10:59.586
the doors were just blown wide

01:10:59.721 --> 01:11:00.821
open on the whole thing.

01:11:00.955 --> 01:11:02.889
people really saw the potential

01:11:03.024 --> 01:11:04.458
of this as a market.

01:11:04.592 --> 01:11:06.693
this consumption of films has

01:11:06.828 --> 01:11:08.662
increased our audiences' both

01:11:08.796 --> 01:11:10.330
appetite for them and, now,

01:11:10.465 --> 01:11:11.832
knowledge of them, so therefore,

01:11:11.966 --> 01:11:13.000
it's getting harder and harder

01:11:13.134 --> 01:11:14.835
to impress them.

01:11:14.969 --> 01:11:15.702
it's one of the reasons why

01:11:15.837 --> 01:11:16.937
i think 3- d is taking off.

01:11:17.071 --> 01:11:19.106
it's just a new way of looking

01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:19.773
at a film.

01:11:19.907 --> 01:11:21.842
the actor is like a piece of

01:11:21.976 --> 01:11:22.776
sculpture or something, only

01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:24.478
it's moving and it comes out,

01:11:24.612 --> 01:11:25.712
and, like, it's a combination of

01:11:25.847 --> 01:11:27.614
theater and film and music and

01:11:27.749 --> 01:11:29.082
everything.

01:11:29.217 --> 01:11:30.450
i hate 3- d.

01:11:30.585 --> 01:11:31.752
i put on those glasses,

01:11:31.886 --> 01:11:32.986
i get sick to my stomach.

01:11:33.121 --> 01:11:35.222
it's dark looking through them.

01:11:35.356 --> 01:11:36.857
the whole 3- d phenomenon,

01:11:36.991 --> 01:11:38.592
it's a marketing fucking scheme,

01:11:38.726 --> 01:11:39.259
isn't it?

01:11:39.394 --> 01:11:40.494
i can safely say, as a

01:11:40.628 --> 01:11:42.262
viewer, i'm totally uninterested

01:11:42.397 --> 01:11:43.163
in it.

01:11:43.298 --> 01:11:44.498
i'm without any interest

01:11:44.632 --> 01:11:45.565
whatsoever.

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:46.967
i think it's a fad.

01:11:47.101 --> 01:11:48.135
i think it will burn out.

01:11:48.269 --> 01:11:49.903
the studios are not wise to

01:11:50.038 --> 01:11:52.339
just slap 3- d on everything.

01:11:52.473 --> 01:11:54.141
with avatar, there's a reason

01:11:54.275 --> 01:11:56.943
that film is in 3- d, because

01:11:57.078 --> 01:11:58.011
it is taking you on an

01:11:58.146 --> 01:11:59.379
experience.

01:11:59.514 --> 01:12:00.781
it isn't something that was

01:12:00.915 --> 01:12:03.950
added on for money or a joke

01:12:04.085 --> 01:12:05.652
or a gimmick.

01:12:05.787 --> 01:12:07.721
it's there because it was

01:12:07.855 --> 01:12:10.490
created that way.

01:12:10.625 --> 01:12:11.525
avatar is two completely

01:12:11.659 --> 01:12:12.826
different forms of filmmaking

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:13.527
combined.

01:12:13.661 --> 01:12:15.062
we only use lenses for about 1/3

01:12:15.196 --> 01:12:16.463
of the movie, which is all

01:12:16.597 --> 01:12:18.031
sets and, you know, just normal

01:12:18.166 --> 01:12:19.766
stuff- lighting, normal live

01:12:19.901 --> 01:12:21.101
action.

01:12:21.235 --> 01:12:22.235
we used virtual lenses for the

01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:25.372
other 2/3.

01:12:25.506 --> 01:12:26.740
we never shot in a real jungle.

01:12:26.874 --> 01:12:27.708
we had to create the jungle.

01:12:27.842 --> 01:12:29.276
it was all computer modeling- 

01:12:29.410 --> 01:12:31.278
every blade of grass, every bug

01:12:31.412 --> 01:12:32.145
buzzing around- 

01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:35.582
not one foot of film shot in

01:12:35.717 --> 01:12:37.484
a real jungle.

01:12:37.618 --> 01:12:39.219
you have this idea that you

01:12:39.354 --> 01:12:40.320
could home in on a

01:12:40.455 --> 01:12:42.155
mathematically perfect model for

01:12:42.290 --> 01:12:43.390
creating reality if you just

01:12:43.524 --> 01:12:44.758
throw enough computing power at

01:12:44.892 --> 01:12:45.826
it and you just throw enough

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:47.094
software at it.

01:12:47.228 --> 01:12:47.761
guess what we found?

01:12:47.895 --> 01:12:48.462
it didn't work.

01:12:48.596 --> 01:12:50.330
it required that i, the artist,

01:12:50.465 --> 01:12:51.998
and people who were trained in

01:12:52.133 --> 01:12:53.767
photography and looking at how

01:12:53.901 --> 01:12:55.302
light interacted with things to

01:12:55.436 --> 01:12:57.104
figure out how to write the code

01:12:57.238 --> 01:12:58.905
to make it look "real."

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:00.240
what i find is, the

01:13:00.375 --> 01:13:02.442
manipulations that the digital

01:13:02.577 --> 01:13:04.878
media like to do- they are

01:13:05.012 --> 01:13:06.546
seductive, but ultimately,

01:13:06.681 --> 01:13:07.481
they're a little bit hollow.

01:13:07.615 --> 01:13:08.815
the analogy i would always use

01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:10.550
is, i remember this summer when

01:13:10.685 --> 01:13:12.018
chips ahoy, or whoever- they

01:13:12.153 --> 01:13:12.853
came out with these chocolate

01:13:12.987 --> 01:13:13.620
chip cookies that were like

01:13:13.755 --> 01:13:14.588
they just came out of the oven,

01:13:14.722 --> 01:13:15.255
and they were soft.

01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:15.922
it was like, "oh, this is

01:13:16.057 --> 01:13:16.590
amazing.

01:13:16.724 --> 01:13:17.791
it's a soft cookie."

01:13:17.925 --> 01:13:18.792
and then after a couple of

01:13:18.926 --> 01:13:20.060
months, you're like, "oh, no,

01:13:20.194 --> 01:13:22.028
this is some horrible chemical

01:13:22.163 --> 01:13:24.364
crap that's giving this bad

01:13:24.499 --> 01:13:25.165
illusion that fools you

01:13:25.299 --> 01:13:25.832
at first.

01:13:25.967 --> 01:13:27.067
my big concern is that the

01:13:27.201 --> 01:13:29.703
image ultimately with cgi- 

01:13:29.837 --> 01:13:31.104
i don't know if our younger

01:13:31.239 --> 01:13:32.539
generation is believing anything

01:13:32.673 --> 01:13:35.242
anymore on screen.

01:13:35.376 --> 01:13:36.777
it's not real.

01:13:36.911 --> 01:13:38.545
you're presenting a complete

01:13:38.679 --> 01:13:40.947
unreality and making them feel

01:13:41.082 --> 01:13:42.949
like it's real, whereas, before,

01:13:43.084 --> 01:13:44.918
it was captured in reality- 

01:13:45.052 --> 01:13:46.586
all right, you've- i'm

01:13:46.721 --> 01:13:48.155
betting you've been on a couple

01:13:48.289 --> 01:13:49.890
of movie sets.

01:13:50.024 --> 01:13:51.391
when was it ever real?

01:13:51.526 --> 01:13:52.859
there was a kind of a wall there

01:13:52.994 --> 01:13:53.727
and nothing over there.

01:13:53.861 --> 01:13:54.728
there was 30 people standing

01:13:54.862 --> 01:13:55.395
around.

01:13:55.530 --> 01:13:56.496
there was a guy with a boom mic.

01:13:56.631 --> 01:13:57.397
there's another guy up on a

01:13:57.532 --> 01:13:58.532
ladder with his ass crack

01:13:58.666 --> 01:13:59.499
hangin' out.

01:13:59.634 --> 01:14:01.168
there's fake rain.

01:14:01.302 --> 01:14:03.203
your "street night exterior

01:14:03.337 --> 01:14:05.172
new york" was a day interior

01:14:05.306 --> 01:14:06.006
burbank.

01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:08.074
what was ever real?

01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:11.812
we're free of the old

01:14:11.946 --> 01:14:14.047
technology of capturing those

01:14:14.182 --> 01:14:17.083
images- camera, film, lens- 

01:14:17.218 --> 01:14:19.286
exposure.

01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:20.921
it gives you more control,

01:14:21.055 --> 01:14:24.825
more choice, more ways to access

01:14:24.959 --> 01:14:26.226
what you're imagining in your

01:14:26.360 --> 01:14:28.295
head.

01:14:29.497 --> 01:14:30.630
computers will only get

01:14:30.765 --> 01:14:32.065
better and better.

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:33.333
you'll be able to produce

01:14:33.468 --> 01:14:34.968
anything you want, completely

01:14:35.102 --> 01:14:36.503
realistically.

01:14:36.637 --> 01:14:38.905
and ultimately, if you've got

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:41.441
enough time, the world is your

01:14:41.576 --> 01:14:43.510
oyster.

01:14:48.749 --> 01:14:50.217
we've had to try to outpace

01:14:50.351 --> 01:14:52.219
the audience's imagination, do

01:14:52.353 --> 01:14:52.986
something they haven't seen

01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:55.021
before, and every year, it has

01:14:55.156 --> 01:14:57.090
to be even more and more real.

01:14:58.826 --> 01:15:00.560
the artists and the filmmakers

01:15:00.695 --> 01:15:02.929
are constantly trying to up the

01:15:03.064 --> 01:15:05.398
amount of spectacle and realism,

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.234
and so that really puts us in

01:15:07.368 --> 01:15:08.768
the position of- like never

01:15:08.903 --> 01:15:11.004
before- really having to wed

01:15:11.138 --> 01:15:13.073
technology and art.

01:15:15.810 --> 01:15:16.943
that's what's great about the

01:15:17.078 --> 01:15:18.278
digital technology is that it

01:15:18.412 --> 01:15:19.546
sort of doubles in everything

01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:22.482
about once every two years.

01:15:22.617 --> 01:15:24.117
once you've set your mind on

01:15:24.252 --> 01:15:26.019
that path, it all becomes very

01:15:26.153 --> 01:15:26.686
simple.

01:15:26.821 --> 01:15:27.821
it's just gonna be a matter of

01:15:27.955 --> 01:15:29.189
time, 'cause digital is gonna

01:15:29.323 --> 01:15:30.891
continue to improve.

01:15:31.025 --> 01:15:32.859
camera companies like red,

01:15:32.994 --> 01:15:34.728
arri, sony, and others are

01:15:34.862 --> 01:15:36.196
constantly developing new

01:15:36.330 --> 01:15:37.631
products and continue to make

01:15:37.765 --> 01:15:39.799
advances in dynamic range,

01:15:39.934 --> 01:15:42.435
resolution, and color.

01:15:42.570 --> 01:15:43.303
i love it that all of these

01:15:43.437 --> 01:15:44.571
manufacturers are competing

01:15:44.705 --> 01:15:45.739
against each other to make great

01:15:45.873 --> 01:15:46.406
cameras.

01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:48.508
make them smaller, make them

01:15:48.643 --> 01:15:51.711
faster, cheaper, better sensors.

01:15:51.846 --> 01:15:52.579
the dynamic range of

01:15:52.713 --> 01:15:54.114
a digital camera, up until

01:15:54.248 --> 01:15:56.049
recently, has been limited to,

01:15:56.183 --> 01:15:58.785
really, a maximum of ten stops.

01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:00.353
but you don't see that problem

01:16:00.488 --> 01:16:03.390
in the epic or the alexa.

01:16:03.524 --> 01:16:05.125
the dynamic range was much

01:16:05.259 --> 01:16:06.560
better than i was used to with

01:16:06.694 --> 01:16:07.694
digital.

01:16:07.828 --> 01:16:09.162
up until the mid- '90s, for

01:16:09.297 --> 01:16:11.231
arri, it was all photochemical.

01:16:11.365 --> 01:16:12.899
we saw the digital technology

01:16:13.034 --> 01:16:14.601
maturing to a point, though,

01:16:14.735 --> 01:16:15.936
where we began investing in

01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:17.504
digital technology.

01:16:17.638 --> 01:16:19.105
the sensor that we use now in

01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:21.174
the alexa camera allowed us to

01:16:21.309 --> 01:16:23.043
offer a camera that we can

01:16:23.177 --> 01:16:24.044
proudly promote as

01:16:24.178 --> 01:16:25.979
a feature- film camera.

01:16:26.113 --> 01:16:27.480
the alexa takes all of that

01:16:27.615 --> 01:16:29.049
we were excited about in terms

01:16:29.183 --> 01:16:30.283
of low- budget filmmaking and

01:16:30.418 --> 01:16:31.685
then brings the sort of textural

01:16:31.819 --> 01:16:32.986
quality that film has, you know?

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:34.254
it brings that familiarity in

01:16:34.388 --> 01:16:35.255
terms of color space.

01:16:35.389 --> 01:16:36.423
and the only reason i was

01:16:36.557 --> 01:16:37.557
really interested in using the

01:16:37.692 --> 01:16:38.959
alexa was because it was made by

01:16:39.093 --> 01:16:40.527
arriflex, and i had heard that

01:16:40.661 --> 01:16:42.362
it was like shooting film but

01:16:42.496 --> 01:16:43.997
with a digital format.

01:16:44.131 --> 01:16:46.466
if i am pushed to shoot on

01:16:46.601 --> 01:16:48.768
digital, i could take the alexa,

01:16:48.903 --> 01:16:50.804
and i could probably get good

01:16:50.938 --> 01:16:52.872
results.

01:16:58.946 --> 01:17:00.480
this is the new red, which is

01:17:00.615 --> 01:17:01.147
called an epic.

01:17:01.282 --> 01:17:03.483
so this is, believe it or not,

01:17:03.618 --> 01:17:06.019
60% more resolution

01:17:06.153 --> 01:17:08.088
than a red one.

01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:10.357
when jim jannard showed me

01:17:10.491 --> 01:17:11.958
the epic, you looked at it, and

01:17:12.093 --> 01:17:13.093
you said, "wait a minute.

01:17:13.227 --> 01:17:14.527
what does that do?

01:17:14.662 --> 01:17:16.296
how does that free you up as a- 

01:17:16.430 --> 01:17:18.632
as a storyteller?"

01:17:22.737 --> 01:17:23.870
this camera creates these

01:17:24.005 --> 01:17:26.573
beautiful, rich, very natural

01:17:26.707 --> 01:17:28.241
or very stylistically wonderful

01:17:28.376 --> 01:17:30.610
colors.

01:17:30.745 --> 01:17:32.512
we've taken and digitally

01:17:32.647 --> 01:17:34.414
projected 4k images on a

01:17:34.548 --> 01:17:36.483
gigantic screen, and it is

01:17:36.617 --> 01:17:38.551
absolutely mind- blowing.

01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:42.022
the delivery system of cinema

01:17:42.156 --> 01:17:44.958
is going to change, and that's

01:17:45.092 --> 01:17:47.694
almost- kind of more exciting in

01:17:47.828 --> 01:17:50.130
a way for me, besides the actual

01:17:50.264 --> 01:17:52.265
cameras.

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:55.268
because the very ancient system

01:17:55.403 --> 01:17:56.936
of putting a can of film on a

01:17:57.071 --> 01:17:59.105
truck, driving it to a city,

01:17:59.240 --> 01:17:59.973
unloading it.

01:18:00.107 --> 01:18:01.875
that's being replaced.

01:18:02.009 --> 01:18:03.743
the old way of having to ship

01:18:03.878 --> 01:18:06.646
giant film cans around is very,

01:18:06.781 --> 01:18:09.849
very expensive, so the business

01:18:09.984 --> 01:18:12.652
realized that there was a

01:18:12.787 --> 01:18:15.188
tremendous possible savings

01:18:15.322 --> 01:18:16.956
in digital delivery

01:18:17.091 --> 01:18:19.893
and digital projection.

01:18:20.027 --> 01:18:20.827
we all want that pristine

01:18:20.961 --> 01:18:21.494
print.

01:18:21.629 --> 01:18:23.196
we all want the first print off

01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:24.898
the negative, but we, you know,

01:18:25.032 --> 01:18:26.132
we can't have that, so you have

01:18:26.267 --> 01:18:27.233
to copy it.

01:18:27.368 --> 01:18:28.768
and the advantage of a dcp is,

01:18:28.903 --> 01:18:30.303
there's no real copying.

01:18:30.438 --> 01:18:31.871
once it's scanned, it doesn't

01:18:32.006 --> 01:18:33.473
get copied again.

01:18:33.607 --> 01:18:35.108
it's cloned, so it's exactly the

01:18:35.242 --> 01:18:37.010
same thing.

01:18:37.144 --> 01:18:38.411
i'm getting more impressed

01:18:38.546 --> 01:18:39.813
with digital projection, as

01:18:39.947 --> 01:18:42.582
much as, you know, i'm not big

01:18:42.717 --> 01:18:44.584
on technology, i think digital

01:18:44.719 --> 01:18:46.319
projection has come a long way.

01:18:46.454 --> 01:18:49.422
in the last two years, we've

01:18:49.557 --> 01:18:51.491
installed 10,000 digital

01:18:51.625 --> 01:18:53.793
projectors into cinemas.

01:18:53.928 --> 01:18:55.695
the conversion is taking place

01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:56.629
globally.

01:18:56.764 --> 01:18:59.699
we're probably 50% or more

01:18:59.834 --> 01:19:01.301
there, and the rest of the

01:19:01.435 --> 01:19:02.602
conversions will happen very

01:19:02.737 --> 01:19:03.636
quickly.

01:19:03.771 --> 01:19:04.571
they produce gorgeous

01:19:04.705 --> 01:19:06.740
pictures, and you had a steady

01:19:06.874 --> 01:19:07.741
building of a wave.

01:19:07.875 --> 01:19:09.209
that's why we're gonna be up to

01:19:09.343 --> 01:19:14.414
100,000 digital screens by 2015.

01:19:14.548 --> 01:19:16.349
the business model for

01:19:16.484 --> 01:19:20.487
printing film is endangered,

01:19:20.621 --> 01:19:24.491
and ultimately, i hope that

01:19:24.625 --> 01:19:26.559
that doesn't take film with it.

01:19:29.363 --> 01:19:30.797
as a kid, i went to the

01:19:30.931 --> 01:19:31.898
movies.

01:19:32.032 --> 01:19:33.500
and you sat down, and there was,

01:19:33.634 --> 01:19:34.934
like, a big red curtain,

01:19:35.069 --> 01:19:38.938
and then that curtain parted.

01:19:39.073 --> 01:19:40.540
and there was- the movie was

01:19:40.674 --> 01:19:42.108
going to begin, right?

01:19:42.243 --> 01:19:43.810
and you went, "oh, my gosh.

01:19:43.944 --> 01:19:44.778
whoa, this is special."

01:19:44.912 --> 01:19:48.281
well, that's my childhood image.

01:19:48.415 --> 01:19:50.150
it's not as special anymore.

01:19:50.284 --> 01:19:51.885
it's another thing.

01:19:52.019 --> 01:19:53.186
in a way, cinema was the

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:55.121
church of the 20th century,

01:19:55.256 --> 01:19:56.156
because everybody would come to

01:19:56.290 --> 01:19:57.524
this large, dark room and sit

01:19:57.658 --> 01:19:58.691
and look up at this thing, which

01:19:58.826 --> 01:20:00.393
would tell you an enormous

01:20:00.528 --> 01:20:01.828
amount of how to dress, how to

01:20:01.962 --> 01:20:03.062
act, how to behave with women,

01:20:03.197 --> 01:20:05.131
how to be a hero.

01:20:08.536 --> 01:20:09.335
there's something

01:20:09.470 --> 01:20:10.937
extraordinary about seeing that

01:20:11.071 --> 01:20:13.473
actor's face as 40 feet high,

01:20:13.607 --> 01:20:15.608
and at 40 feet high, there's

01:20:15.743 --> 01:20:17.143
something mythic about it that's

01:20:17.278 --> 01:20:18.711
beyond your everyday life.

01:20:18.846 --> 01:20:19.746
i think cinema should be a

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:21.714
huge, big expansion.

01:20:21.849 --> 01:20:23.116
it should be 80 feet wide, and

01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:24.317
you should envelop the audience

01:20:24.451 --> 01:20:25.585
in the screen.

01:20:25.719 --> 01:20:26.719
'cause that's cinema.

01:20:26.854 --> 01:20:28.021
yeah, that's cinema.

01:20:28.155 --> 01:20:28.922
and the sound all round you and

01:20:29.056 --> 01:20:29.589
everything.

01:20:29.723 --> 01:20:31.157
i mean, why people want to watch

01:20:31.292 --> 01:20:32.525
movies on their computers,

01:20:32.660 --> 01:20:34.594
i shall never know.

01:20:36.163 --> 01:20:37.430
i see people watch movies on

01:20:37.565 --> 01:20:38.798
their iphone in the subway all

01:20:38.933 --> 01:20:42.001
the time, and i'm like, "no!"

01:20:43.571 --> 01:20:45.071
who am i to say that it's bad?

01:20:45.206 --> 01:20:46.539
it doesn't have to be bad.

01:20:46.674 --> 01:20:47.941
late at night, my wife's

01:20:48.075 --> 01:20:49.776
asleep and i can't sleep, and

01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:51.744
i pull up netflix on my iphone,

01:20:51.879 --> 01:20:53.346
put on some good headphones and

01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:54.113
watch a film that close to my

01:20:54.248 --> 01:20:54.781
face.

01:20:54.915 --> 01:20:55.481
like, there's something

01:20:55.616 --> 01:20:57.250
interesting about that.

01:20:57.384 --> 01:20:58.751
you can interact with things

01:20:58.886 --> 01:21:00.019
very privately now, and i think,

01:21:00.154 --> 01:21:01.087
"what's missing?"

01:21:01.222 --> 01:21:02.922
if i want to cry without people

01:21:03.057 --> 01:21:03.690
seeing, i'm gonna put on the

01:21:03.824 --> 01:21:05.325
steel magnolias, you know, and

01:21:05.459 --> 01:21:06.392
i'm gonna cry.

01:21:06.527 --> 01:21:07.460
and if my wife wakes up, i'll

01:21:07.595 --> 01:21:08.394
just hit pause and put it

01:21:08.529 --> 01:21:09.062
under a pillow.

01:21:09.196 --> 01:21:09.829
i mean, there's something

01:21:09.964 --> 01:21:10.763
interesting about that that

01:21:10.898 --> 01:21:12.131
i feel like we didn't get

01:21:12.266 --> 01:21:13.399
a chance to experience before.

01:21:13.534 --> 01:21:14.601
if you get asked on a date,

01:21:14.735 --> 01:21:15.635
nobody's like, "let's go to the

01:21:15.769 --> 01:21:16.336
movies" anymore.

01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:17.604
i don't even feel like that's

01:21:17.738 --> 01:21:18.471
going on.

01:21:18.606 --> 01:21:19.539
i feel like- people are like,

01:21:19.673 --> 01:21:20.473
"let's, like, watch something on

01:21:20.608 --> 01:21:22.242
netflix streaming on my bed"- 

01:21:22.376 --> 01:21:23.009
which might just be, like,

01:21:23.143 --> 01:21:24.077
24- year- old guys' way of

01:21:24.211 --> 01:21:24.878
getting you to sit on their

01:21:25.012 --> 01:21:26.112
bed- but i think that that's

01:21:26.247 --> 01:21:26.946
what's happening.

01:21:27.081 --> 01:21:27.614
i can get any

01:21:27.748 --> 01:21:28.648
jean- luc godard movie.

01:21:28.782 --> 01:21:29.949
i can get any movie from the

01:21:30.084 --> 01:21:30.617
past, anything.

01:21:30.751 --> 01:21:32.118
and netflix will send it to me,

01:21:32.253 --> 01:21:33.019
and i can just sit down and

01:21:33.153 --> 01:21:33.887
watch it.

01:21:34.021 --> 01:21:34.954
but you're not gonna see all

01:21:35.089 --> 01:21:35.622
the detail.

01:21:35.756 --> 01:21:37.056
you won't be able to feel it

01:21:37.191 --> 01:21:38.958
like you would be able to feel- 

01:21:39.093 --> 01:21:40.293
my big- screen tv is plenty

01:21:40.427 --> 01:21:41.160
big.

01:21:41.295 --> 01:21:42.562
i mean, you can go to theaters

01:21:42.696 --> 01:21:43.329
to make out with girls and

01:21:43.464 --> 01:21:44.397
things like that, but that- 

01:21:44.531 --> 01:21:45.632
you know, i'm way past that age,

01:21:45.766 --> 01:21:46.299
so...

01:21:46.433 --> 01:21:46.966
sure.

01:21:47.101 --> 01:21:47.934
believe me.

01:21:48.068 --> 01:21:49.135
there's so many different

01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:50.803
ways to watch a movie.

01:21:50.938 --> 01:21:52.906
that shared experience aspect,

01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:55.508
too, it's- you know, that's

01:21:55.643 --> 01:21:57.543
shifting from the "going to the

01:21:57.678 --> 01:21:58.711
movies."

01:21:58.846 --> 01:22:00.179
well, it's also becoming much

01:22:00.314 --> 01:22:01.981
larger virtually, you know?

01:22:02.116 --> 01:22:03.049
communal space will

01:22:03.183 --> 01:22:05.251
definitely expand virtually, so

01:22:05.386 --> 01:22:06.853
we'll start watching movies

01:22:06.987 --> 01:22:08.421
together in these sort of

01:22:08.555 --> 01:22:11.925
virtual worlds, and that will be

01:22:12.059 --> 01:22:14.494
inevitable.

01:22:14.628 --> 01:22:15.161
how do you have the

01:22:15.296 --> 01:22:16.529
pheromones get exchanged

01:22:16.664 --> 01:22:17.230
virtually?

01:22:17.364 --> 01:22:17.897
how do you- 

01:22:18.933 --> 01:22:21.134
how do you bleed and sweat and

01:22:21.268 --> 01:22:21.801
be comfortable and

01:22:21.936 --> 01:22:22.468
uncomfortable- 

01:22:22.603 --> 01:22:23.202
you do all that in the

01:22:23.337 --> 01:22:23.870
theater...

01:22:24.672 --> 01:22:26.272
in your trench coat?

01:22:26.407 --> 01:22:28.374
no, but laughing together and

01:22:28.509 --> 01:22:29.142
crying together.

01:22:29.276 --> 01:22:30.877
and in some way, the virtual

01:22:31.011 --> 01:22:33.646
experience is more rewarding

01:22:33.781 --> 01:22:35.415
because there's an actual

01:22:35.549 --> 01:22:38.017
dialogue going on.

01:22:38.152 --> 01:22:39.352
someone who's 20 years old

01:22:39.486 --> 01:22:42.355
does not care about the loss of

01:22:42.489 --> 01:22:43.589
cinemas as a communal space,

01:22:43.724 --> 01:22:44.257
you know?

01:22:44.391 --> 01:22:45.391
they're interested in how they

01:22:45.526 --> 01:22:46.259
want to tell their story and get

01:22:46.393 --> 01:22:48.094
it out to friends on facebook

01:22:48.228 --> 01:22:48.828
or whatever it is.

01:22:48.963 --> 01:22:49.495
you got to go with it,

01:22:49.630 --> 01:22:50.163
you know?

01:22:50.297 --> 01:22:51.531
and if you become unable to deal

01:22:51.665 --> 01:22:52.298
with it, then that's fine,

01:22:52.433 --> 01:22:53.900
because that means your time is

01:22:54.034 --> 01:22:55.935
finished, and, you know, it's

01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:56.936
time for other people to take

01:22:57.071 --> 01:22:58.237
it on.

01:22:58.372 --> 01:23:00.974
the kids 30 and under have

01:23:01.108 --> 01:23:03.776
seen endless digital images- 

01:23:03.911 --> 01:23:05.578
on their computer, on their

01:23:05.713 --> 01:23:09.048
television- and that, to them,

01:23:09.183 --> 01:23:10.550
is their film.

01:23:10.684 --> 01:23:12.685
i just had hoped that, you

01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:14.787
know, these little cameras would

01:23:14.922 --> 01:23:16.889
make kind of a revolution where

01:23:17.024 --> 01:23:18.925
you would say, "fuck film

01:23:19.059 --> 01:23:20.093
school."

01:23:20.227 --> 01:23:21.761
just do it ourselves.

01:23:21.895 --> 01:23:23.496
there's a lot of talent and

01:23:23.630 --> 01:23:25.431
stuff that could be freed by

01:23:25.566 --> 01:23:26.432
less respect.

01:23:26.567 --> 01:23:27.734
everyone is interpreting

01:23:27.868 --> 01:23:30.603
that reality- or what they

01:23:30.738 --> 01:23:31.337
think is reality- 

01:23:31.472 --> 01:23:32.839
through an image, through

01:23:32.973 --> 01:23:35.308
a lens, you know?

01:23:35.442 --> 01:23:36.476
and some people are really- some

01:23:36.610 --> 01:23:37.210
kids are really good at it,

01:23:37.344 --> 01:23:38.144
i got to tell ya.

01:23:38.278 --> 01:23:39.512
how come you never use me in

01:23:39.646 --> 01:23:40.813
any pictures?

01:23:40.948 --> 01:23:41.848
you're never here.

01:23:41.982 --> 01:23:43.616
without digital video

01:23:43.751 --> 01:23:44.751
culture, i don't think i ever

01:23:44.885 --> 01:23:46.052
would have been making movies

01:23:46.186 --> 01:23:47.920
because i came at it from- as a

01:23:48.055 --> 01:23:49.055
writer, and i always thought

01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.889
that you have to have a certain

01:23:50.024 --> 01:23:50.757
kind of knowledge, you have to

01:23:50.891 --> 01:23:51.557
be- basically, in my head, i

01:23:51.692 --> 01:23:52.325
was like, "you've got to be a

01:23:52.459 --> 01:23:53.726
dude who knows how to operate

01:23:53.861 --> 01:23:55.061
machines to do this job."

01:23:55.195 --> 01:23:55.962
like, i think i would have been

01:23:56.096 --> 01:23:58.331
scared to step into that role if

01:23:58.465 --> 01:24:00.933
it had involved, you know, like,

01:24:01.068 --> 01:24:01.868
getting a huge camera and

01:24:02.002 --> 01:24:03.236
getting 15 lighting technicians

01:24:03.370 --> 01:24:03.903
together.

01:24:04.038 --> 01:24:04.837
it was like i was able to

01:24:04.972 --> 01:24:06.272
experiment with making movies in

01:24:06.407 --> 01:24:09.776
this really small, private way,

01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:11.044
which was what i needed to do.

01:24:11.178 --> 01:24:12.345
what about the 5ds?

01:24:12.479 --> 01:24:13.946
what about the dslrs?

01:24:14.081 --> 01:24:15.081
these cameras were designed

01:24:15.215 --> 01:24:16.816
at the request of a.p. and

01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:19.719
reuters so that their news

01:24:19.853 --> 01:24:21.687
stills photographers could shoot

01:24:21.822 --> 01:24:25.358
news video for their websites.

01:24:25.492 --> 01:24:27.393
that's it.

01:24:27.528 --> 01:24:28.895
then people came along and went,

01:24:29.029 --> 01:24:31.030
"ooh, i like the look of that.

01:24:31.165 --> 01:24:32.765
i'm gonna use that."

01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:34.934
and it can work, but i hate them

01:24:35.069 --> 01:24:36.269
being used as movie cameras.

01:24:36.403 --> 01:24:36.936
why?

01:24:37.071 --> 01:24:39.172
it's not good enough.

01:24:39.306 --> 01:24:40.573
but they're inexpensive.

01:24:40.707 --> 01:24:42.008
people can make movies- 

01:24:42.142 --> 01:24:43.476
if i'd been at art school and

01:24:43.610 --> 01:24:45.912
i had a canon 7d or a canon 5d,

01:24:46.046 --> 01:24:46.679
you know, it would have been

01:24:46.814 --> 01:24:49.816
wonderful.

01:24:49.950 --> 01:24:50.650
what are you shooting on

01:24:50.784 --> 01:24:51.651
tonight?

01:24:51.785 --> 01:24:52.518
7d.

01:24:52.653 --> 01:24:54.053
on the canon 7d

01:24:54.188 --> 01:24:56.389
for my second- year grad film.

01:24:56.523 --> 01:24:58.524
and action.

01:25:01.195 --> 01:25:02.361
i guess it's the most

01:25:02.496 --> 01:25:03.996
accessible, it gives you a lot- 

01:25:04.131 --> 01:25:06.632
you can capture, but it's not

01:25:06.767 --> 01:25:07.633
super expensive, it's- 

01:25:07.768 --> 01:25:09.902
i wanted to shoot with the 7d

01:25:10.037 --> 01:25:12.438
or the 5d primarily for budget

01:25:12.573 --> 01:25:16.476
reasons and because we are given

01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:17.743
a week in which we have to

01:25:17.878 --> 01:25:19.312
shoot our film.

01:25:19.446 --> 01:25:20.847
and the amount of time that we

01:25:20.981 --> 01:25:22.515
would lose in terms of, like,

01:25:22.649 --> 01:25:23.583
changing the film, checking the

01:25:23.717 --> 01:25:26.219
gate, and being cautious- 

01:25:26.353 --> 01:25:27.587
then i would probably not be

01:25:27.721 --> 01:25:29.122
able to film half the scenes

01:25:29.256 --> 01:25:30.590
i'd want to.

01:25:30.724 --> 01:25:32.458
it's become this very cheap

01:25:32.593 --> 01:25:34.994
way for us to tell our stories

01:25:35.129 --> 01:25:37.497
about ourselves.

01:25:37.631 --> 01:25:39.432
it takes these art forms out

01:25:39.566 --> 01:25:41.534
of a rarefied environment and

01:25:41.668 --> 01:25:43.336
allows more people to make art.

01:25:43.470 --> 01:25:44.337
and cut.

01:25:44.471 --> 01:25:45.438
let's do that one again.

01:25:45.572 --> 01:25:47.473
everybody and his little

01:25:47.608 --> 01:25:49.976
brother has a piece of paper and

01:25:50.110 --> 01:25:52.178
a pencil, but how many great

01:25:52.312 --> 01:25:54.914
stories have been written on

01:25:55.048 --> 01:25:56.749
that piece of paper?

01:25:56.884 --> 01:25:58.684
now the same thing's gonna

01:25:58.819 --> 01:26:00.486
happen in, you know, cinema.

01:26:00.621 --> 01:26:03.289
there used to be that

01:26:03.423 --> 01:26:05.224
encumbrance, you know, where

01:26:05.359 --> 01:26:06.726
filmmakers were guys who- you

01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:08.427
know, people who just sat around

01:26:08.562 --> 01:26:10.062
coffee shops saying what great

01:26:10.197 --> 01:26:11.597
films they would make if "the

01:26:11.732 --> 01:26:12.565
man" would ever give them a

01:26:12.699 --> 01:26:13.232
chance.

01:26:13.367 --> 01:26:14.700
it was kind of great when, like,

01:26:14.835 --> 01:26:16.702
the day came that it was,

01:26:16.837 --> 01:26:19.005
"well, go do it."

01:26:19.139 --> 01:26:20.139
everybody can make a movie

01:26:20.274 --> 01:26:20.806
now.

01:26:20.941 --> 01:26:21.841
movies everywhere.

01:26:21.975 --> 01:26:23.476
that's a good thing.

01:26:23.610 --> 01:26:25.111
i don't think so, actually.

01:26:25.245 --> 01:26:26.913
there's less good.

01:26:27.047 --> 01:26:27.747
there's more bad.

01:26:27.881 --> 01:26:29.549
because everybody's able to do

01:26:29.683 --> 01:26:30.650
whatever they want to do.

01:26:30.784 --> 01:26:32.552
there's democratization of it- 

01:26:32.686 --> 01:26:34.687
fantastic- but i think my kids

01:26:34.821 --> 01:26:35.354
will suffer.

01:26:35.489 --> 01:26:36.822
they will not have the quality

01:26:36.957 --> 01:26:38.391
that we had growing up 'cause

01:26:38.525 --> 01:26:40.693
there isn't somebody there- 

01:26:40.827 --> 01:26:41.661
there isn't a tastemaker

01:26:41.795 --> 01:26:42.962
involved.

01:26:43.096 --> 01:26:45.031
wow.

01:26:47.935 --> 01:26:49.502
is it the end of film?

01:26:49.636 --> 01:26:50.503
what do you think?

01:26:50.637 --> 01:26:53.072
i think celluloid is still

01:26:53.207 --> 01:26:55.341
gonna be a choice.

01:27:13.126 --> 01:27:15.161
a transition starts with

01:27:15.295 --> 01:27:17.063
people offering a new choice,

01:27:17.197 --> 01:27:18.998
but it finishes with taking the

01:27:19.132 --> 01:27:20.967
old choice away, and i don't

01:27:21.101 --> 01:27:22.468
think technically we're ready

01:27:22.603 --> 01:27:23.336
to do that yet.

01:27:23.470 --> 01:27:25.338
well, we have 100 years of

01:27:25.472 --> 01:27:26.772
experience, basically, shooting

01:27:26.907 --> 01:27:29.408
on film, and film is still

01:27:29.543 --> 01:27:31.110
around.

01:27:31.245 --> 01:27:32.278
nobody but george lucas

01:27:32.412 --> 01:27:33.179
said, you know, that film

01:27:33.313 --> 01:27:33.846
is dead.

01:27:33.981 --> 01:27:36.415
and he said that 20 years ago,

01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:37.850
and film is not dead,

01:27:37.985 --> 01:27:39.285
because people still like to

01:27:39.419 --> 01:27:41.487
shoot on film because it really

01:27:41.622 --> 01:27:44.257
has a incredibly beautiful look.

01:27:44.391 --> 01:27:45.992
who cares, you know?

01:27:46.126 --> 01:27:47.727
20 years from now, they won't

01:27:47.861 --> 01:27:48.427
be saying, "it looks like

01:27:48.562 --> 01:27:49.095
film."

01:27:49.229 --> 01:27:50.263
they'll be saying, "look at what

01:27:50.397 --> 01:27:51.530
i can do with my digital."

01:27:51.665 --> 01:27:52.765
i will be one of the last

01:27:52.899 --> 01:27:54.667
guys shooting film and chris

01:27:54.801 --> 01:27:55.601
nolan will be one of the last

01:27:55.736 --> 01:27:57.203
directors shooting film, but i'm

01:27:57.337 --> 01:27:58.771
certain we'll be using digital

01:27:58.905 --> 01:28:00.673
technology within the next

01:28:00.807 --> 01:28:01.340
ten years.

01:28:01.475 --> 01:28:03.309
i hope five or ten years down

01:28:03.443 --> 01:28:04.477
the road film still exists.

01:28:04.611 --> 01:28:05.945
i mean, i still plan to shoot on

01:28:06.079 --> 01:28:06.679
film.

01:28:06.813 --> 01:28:08.748
is it the end of film?

01:28:10.884 --> 01:28:13.085
yeah, i guess it is,

01:28:13.220 --> 01:28:14.954
and i think in five years, film

01:28:15.088 --> 01:28:17.390
will be- film will be the

01:28:17.524 --> 01:28:18.224
exception.

01:28:18.358 --> 01:28:20.293
i really do.

01:28:21.495 --> 01:28:23.596
film production peaked in

01:28:23.730 --> 01:28:25.064
2007.

01:28:25.198 --> 01:28:26.399
our factory, at that time, was

01:28:26.533 --> 01:28:29.702
working at 110% to produce

01:28:29.836 --> 01:28:30.736
film cameras.

01:28:30.871 --> 01:28:32.505
then what happened?

01:28:32.639 --> 01:28:35.308
then the world changed.

01:28:35.442 --> 01:28:37.376
new purchases are all digital.

01:28:39.413 --> 01:28:40.880
film cameras can last for

01:28:41.014 --> 01:28:43.082
decades, and they will still be

01:28:43.216 --> 01:28:44.984
available and in use.

01:28:45.118 --> 01:28:47.787
however, all major manufacturers

01:28:47.921 --> 01:28:49.522
have ceased development of new

01:28:49.656 --> 01:28:51.424
film cameras.

01:28:51.558 --> 01:28:54.727
they no longer make them.

01:28:54.861 --> 01:28:55.494
we will have to say

01:28:55.629 --> 01:28:56.729
"good- bye" to celluloid.

01:28:56.863 --> 01:28:58.698
it will go away, i'm afraid, and

01:28:58.832 --> 01:28:59.532
it'll be kept for special

01:28:59.666 --> 01:29:01.367
occasions, i think,

01:29:01.501 --> 01:29:03.169
but it's gonna change.

01:29:03.303 --> 01:29:05.237
once that option is gone...

01:29:05.372 --> 01:29:06.906
right.

01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:08.407
once the young people don't

01:29:08.542 --> 01:29:09.475
have that experience- 

01:29:09.609 --> 01:29:11.377
i think we're living through

01:29:11.511 --> 01:29:13.813
its total transformation.

01:29:13.947 --> 01:29:14.714
i mean, i think, in general,

01:29:14.848 --> 01:29:16.349
people's fear is that it's just

01:29:16.483 --> 01:29:17.683
gonna be endless noise and no

01:29:17.818 --> 01:29:19.251
one will be able to tell what's

01:29:19.386 --> 01:29:21.053
good or bad, and no one will be

01:29:21.188 --> 01:29:22.888
able to make good things and

01:29:23.023 --> 01:29:23.756
that good things will just get

01:29:23.890 --> 01:29:24.924
lost.

01:29:25.058 --> 01:29:26.125
that's a danger, i think, in

01:29:26.259 --> 01:29:28.294
the continuation of our culture.

01:29:28.428 --> 01:29:29.295
what do you go back to when you

01:29:29.429 --> 01:29:30.930
need to go back to the well?

01:29:31.064 --> 01:29:32.631
where do you get the nourishment

01:29:32.766 --> 01:29:34.600
culturally, artistically,

01:29:34.735 --> 01:29:35.401
intellectually?

01:29:35.535 --> 01:29:37.503
where do you get it?

01:29:37.637 --> 01:29:38.871
an important step in the

01:29:39.005 --> 01:29:41.974
moviemaking process is archival:

01:29:42.109 --> 01:29:44.543
storing the final complete movie

01:29:44.678 --> 01:29:46.345
and the materials used to create

01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:47.613
it.

01:29:47.748 --> 01:29:49.548
nobody takes archiving

01:29:49.683 --> 01:29:50.649
seriously.

01:29:50.784 --> 01:29:51.951
they go, "oh, i'll save it on

01:29:52.085 --> 01:29:53.119
hard drive," and they put the

01:29:53.253 --> 01:29:54.520
hard drive on the shelf.

01:29:54.654 --> 01:29:56.255
and a year later, you load it,

01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:58.624
and it goes, "tick, tick, tick,"

01:29:58.759 --> 01:30:00.793
'cause they stick.

01:30:00.927 --> 01:30:01.894
if you don't fire them up all

01:30:02.028 --> 01:30:03.195
the time, they stick.

01:30:03.330 --> 01:30:04.563
if you do fire them up all the

01:30:04.698 --> 01:30:06.632
time, they wear out and go,

01:30:06.767 --> 01:30:09.435
"tick, tick, tick."

01:30:09.569 --> 01:30:11.437
since the early 1950s- since

01:30:11.571 --> 01:30:12.738
the advent of commercial

01:30:12.873 --> 01:30:14.840
television, there have been

01:30:14.975 --> 01:30:18.077
80 formats of video to date.

01:30:18.211 --> 01:30:20.913
80 formats of video, okay?

01:30:21.047 --> 01:30:23.048
and most of them cannot be

01:30:23.183 --> 01:30:24.517
played anymore because the

01:30:24.651 --> 01:30:26.919
machines simply don't exist.

01:30:27.053 --> 01:30:28.087
when we make a movie, we have

01:30:28.221 --> 01:30:30.990
two digital copies of all of the

01:30:31.124 --> 01:30:31.891
dailies.

01:30:32.025 --> 01:30:33.426
well, when you box those up to

01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:35.027
be stored, you have to put a

01:30:35.162 --> 01:30:38.397
reader in with the thing.

01:30:38.532 --> 01:30:41.667
i have archival tape formats for

01:30:41.802 --> 01:30:43.169
music videos and commercials

01:30:43.303 --> 01:30:46.505
that i did in the 1980s, and

01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:49.008
there's no machines that can

01:30:49.142 --> 01:30:49.742
play them.

01:30:49.876 --> 01:30:52.144
there are no archival formats

01:30:52.279 --> 01:30:53.412
worth anything in the digital

01:30:53.547 --> 01:30:55.347
realm that you would put any

01:30:55.482 --> 01:30:56.582
stock in, so there are all kinds

01:30:56.716 --> 01:30:57.616
of issues that simply haven't

01:30:57.751 --> 01:30:58.417
been dealt with yet.

01:30:58.552 --> 01:30:59.452
the only way you can make

01:30:59.586 --> 01:31:01.854
sure that a film or anything of

01:31:01.988 --> 01:31:03.756
a moving image is gonna be

01:31:03.890 --> 01:31:05.357
around, maybe, 60 to 70 years

01:31:05.492 --> 01:31:06.926
from now- interestingly enough,

01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:08.994
ironically enough- is celluloid.

01:31:14.901 --> 01:31:16.335
film is unique because film

01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:17.703
is a capture medium and

01:31:17.838 --> 01:31:20.039
a storage medium.

01:31:20.173 --> 01:31:21.574
so if you really want to go

01:31:21.708 --> 01:31:22.641
back and if you've stored it

01:31:22.776 --> 01:31:25.144
under the right conditions, 100

01:31:25.278 --> 01:31:26.278
years later, all you have to do

01:31:26.413 --> 01:31:27.246
is shine light through it and

01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:28.180
you'll be able to see it.

01:31:28.315 --> 01:31:29.915
it will never be

01:31:30.050 --> 01:31:30.883
format- obsolete.

01:31:31.017 --> 01:31:32.117
there was a conference in

01:31:32.252 --> 01:31:35.321
1909 where they put together the

01:31:35.455 --> 01:31:37.623
standard for film.

01:31:37.757 --> 01:31:39.492
well, that hasn't changed in 102

01:31:39.626 --> 01:31:41.193
years.

01:31:41.328 --> 01:31:42.661
if i have a film in my nitrate

01:31:42.796 --> 01:31:44.363
vaults, i can pull it out and

01:31:44.498 --> 01:31:45.965
run it on a projector today,

01:31:46.099 --> 01:31:46.899
even though it may have been

01:31:47.033 --> 01:31:49.902
made in 1895.

01:31:50.036 --> 01:31:51.737
if the point, ultimately, of

01:31:51.872 --> 01:31:54.473
archiving is the faithful

01:31:54.608 --> 01:31:55.975
reproduction of the original

01:31:56.109 --> 01:31:59.245
product, filmmakers now- 

01:31:59.379 --> 01:32:00.980
i, as a filmmaker, now have

01:32:01.114 --> 01:32:03.382
a better chance of something

01:32:03.517 --> 01:32:05.284
i made being shown properly 50

01:32:05.418 --> 01:32:07.553
years from now than i ever have

01:32:07.687 --> 01:32:08.654
in history.

01:32:08.788 --> 01:32:09.955
people keep saying, "we don't

01:32:10.090 --> 01:32:11.123
know what's going to happen in

01:32:11.258 --> 01:32:12.491
that 50 years," we don't- 

01:32:12.626 --> 01:32:13.759
"no one's gonna be able to read

01:32:13.894 --> 01:32:14.860
the information" or "it's going

01:32:14.995 --> 01:32:16.762
to decay" or "you have to

01:32:16.897 --> 01:32:17.897
migrate it or it'll die."

01:32:18.031 --> 01:32:18.931
yeah, sure.

01:32:19.065 --> 01:32:19.832
you will.

01:32:19.966 --> 01:32:20.699
and some of those things are

01:32:20.834 --> 01:32:21.367
true.

01:32:21.501 --> 01:32:22.868
all of them are better scenarios

01:32:23.003 --> 01:32:24.937
than film.

01:32:27.974 --> 01:32:29.108
all of everything in this

01:32:29.242 --> 01:32:32.444
whole world is stored digitally.

01:32:32.579 --> 01:32:33.379
yeah.

01:32:33.513 --> 01:32:35.648
so, yeah, it doesn't- you

01:32:35.782 --> 01:32:36.882
know, there's problems with it,

01:32:37.017 --> 01:32:37.550
right?

01:32:37.684 --> 01:32:38.484
but they're gonna solve those

01:32:38.618 --> 01:32:39.318
problems.

01:32:39.452 --> 01:32:41.220
i'll guarantee that.

01:32:41.354 --> 01:32:42.221
there's too much digital

01:32:42.355 --> 01:32:43.589
information out there not to

01:32:43.723 --> 01:32:44.857
figure out a foolproof way to

01:32:44.991 --> 01:32:45.824
store it forever.

01:32:45.959 --> 01:32:50.296
archaeology always improves,

01:32:50.430 --> 01:32:52.431
so as the way that we lose

01:32:52.566 --> 01:32:54.466
things change, the way that we

01:32:54.601 --> 01:32:56.702
invent to find them changes.

01:32:56.836 --> 01:32:57.603
so you're not worried about

01:32:57.737 --> 01:32:59.738
it all disappearing?

01:32:59.873 --> 01:33:00.973
if things are important to

01:33:01.107 --> 01:33:02.441
human beings, we figure out ways

01:33:02.576 --> 01:33:03.609
to preserve them,

01:33:03.743 --> 01:33:05.444
always been true.

01:33:05.579 --> 01:33:07.446
yes, we lose stuff, but that's

01:33:07.581 --> 01:33:08.914
part of life.

01:33:09.049 --> 01:33:10.616
we might get to the stage

01:33:10.750 --> 01:33:14.253
where a print of a film is so

01:33:14.387 --> 01:33:17.323
rare that it's almost like an

01:33:17.457 --> 01:33:20.025
art object that we can go back

01:33:20.160 --> 01:33:21.126
and say, "this is actually a

01:33:21.261 --> 01:33:23.262
print of a film and it's the

01:33:23.396 --> 01:33:25.331
only one in the world."

01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:29.668
100, 200 years from now,

01:33:29.803 --> 01:33:30.836
there won't be a trace of us

01:33:30.971 --> 01:33:32.771
left, and there won't be a trace

01:33:32.906 --> 01:33:35.774
of anything we make now.

01:33:38.845 --> 01:33:39.712
so where are we?

01:33:39.846 --> 01:33:41.780
we're fucked.

01:33:46.953 --> 01:33:48.487
i don't believe for one

01:33:48.622 --> 01:33:50.456
second that digital imaging or

01:33:50.590 --> 01:33:53.058
digital technology will ever

01:33:53.193 --> 01:33:55.260
take away the humanity of

01:33:55.395 --> 01:33:56.228
storytelling, because

01:33:56.363 --> 01:33:58.530
storytelling, in and of itself,

01:33:58.665 --> 01:34:02.501
is a wholly human concern.

01:34:02.636 --> 01:34:03.869
art is very primordial.

01:34:04.004 --> 01:34:05.504
science is also very primordial,

01:34:05.639 --> 01:34:07.039
so i kind of see all of these

01:34:07.173 --> 01:34:08.607
things as just, sort of- they're

01:34:08.742 --> 01:34:09.975
very harmonious things that

01:34:10.110 --> 01:34:11.276
always have to push on one

01:34:11.411 --> 01:34:13.012
another.

01:34:13.146 --> 01:34:14.313
we are at the top of the

01:34:14.447 --> 01:34:15.414
photochemical process.

01:34:15.548 --> 01:34:16.315
this is about as far as it's

01:34:16.449 --> 01:34:17.282
ever gonna go.

01:34:17.417 --> 01:34:18.517
when you're using digital,

01:34:18.652 --> 01:34:20.486
you're at the very bottom again.

01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:22.821
so you should jump over and help

01:34:22.956 --> 01:34:24.923
build that, 'cause the more

01:34:25.058 --> 01:34:25.924
people that use it, the better

01:34:26.059 --> 01:34:28.193
it gets.

01:34:28.328 --> 01:34:29.962
unless you are participating

01:34:30.096 --> 01:34:31.597
with the revolution, we

01:34:31.731 --> 01:34:34.233
we will be lost in past.

01:34:34.367 --> 01:34:35.801
we can't count ourself out and

01:34:35.935 --> 01:34:37.536
say, "we don't care.

01:34:37.671 --> 01:34:38.470
it's up to you guys."

01:34:38.605 --> 01:34:40.272
no.

01:34:40.407 --> 01:34:42.374
so we have to be in.

01:34:42.509 --> 01:34:43.442
then everyone will have

01:34:43.576 --> 01:34:46.445
access to both the means of

01:34:46.579 --> 01:34:48.781
production and watching anything

01:34:48.915 --> 01:34:51.383
that's ever existed instantly.

01:34:51.518 --> 01:34:52.885
as digital continues to

01:34:53.019 --> 01:34:54.286
change the nature of

01:34:54.421 --> 01:34:55.587
storytelling, we'll also

01:34:55.722 --> 01:34:57.556
continue to change in ways that

01:34:57.691 --> 01:34:58.557
i don't even know i could

01:34:58.692 --> 01:35:00.793
understand, but all things do

01:35:00.927 --> 01:35:02.695
that, and this becomes a giant

01:35:02.829 --> 01:35:05.097
revolution.

01:35:05.231 --> 01:35:06.799
people love great stories.

01:35:06.933 --> 01:35:08.067
they like to get into a world

01:35:08.201 --> 01:35:10.235
and have an experience.

01:35:10.370 --> 01:35:13.105
and how they get there- 

01:35:13.239 --> 01:35:16.208
it doesn't really matter.

01:35:16.342 --> 01:35:17.176
one shouldn't even think,

01:35:17.310 --> 01:35:18.077
"we've stopped and now we've

01:35:18.211 --> 01:35:18.744
reached digital.

01:35:18.878 --> 01:35:20.779
this is it."

01:35:20.914 --> 01:35:21.513
no, no.

01:35:21.648 --> 01:35:22.748
think about where the

01:35:22.882 --> 01:35:25.884
entertainment impulse- where the

01:35:26.019 --> 01:35:26.952
need is going to go.

01:35:27.087 --> 01:35:29.822
do you feel, technologically,

01:35:29.956 --> 01:35:31.857
with where you are- do you feel

01:35:31.991 --> 01:35:32.825
free?

01:35:32.959 --> 01:35:34.359
i'm not sure i ever want to

01:35:34.494 --> 01:35:37.796
feel that we've arrived,

01:35:37.931 --> 01:35:38.597
technologically.

01:35:38.732 --> 01:35:40.099
i always want to feel there's

01:35:40.233 --> 01:35:41.500
something we can do better.

01:35:41.634 --> 01:35:42.701
the people who have come

01:35:42.836 --> 01:35:44.970
before us gave the world new

01:35:45.105 --> 01:35:46.739
ways to dream, and i think it's

01:35:46.873 --> 01:35:49.108
our job to continue that and to

01:35:49.242 --> 01:35:50.843
try to give people new ways to

01:35:50.977 --> 01:35:51.944
dream.

01:35:52.078 --> 01:35:54.246
everything comes down to one

01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:57.583
thing: if you do something with

01:35:57.717 --> 01:35:59.084
your heart- if you do something

01:35:59.219 --> 01:36:00.719
that you are convinced of

01:36:00.854 --> 01:36:03.355
and feel about it, it doesn't

01:36:03.490 --> 01:36:05.424
matter what you use.
