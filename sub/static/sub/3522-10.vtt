01:41.034 --> 01:45.038
You have to be absolutely
110% sure this is who you saw.

01:45.538 --> 01:47.040
This is definitely
the man i saw.

01:47.540 --> 01:49.042
Have you ever
seen him before?

01:49.042 --> 01:50.043
No.

01:50.043 --> 01:51.044
And the other man?

01:51.544 --> 01:53.546
Unfortunately, i didn't
get a good look at him.

01:53.546 --> 01:55.048
The light was reflecting
off the windshield.

01:55.548 --> 01:57.050
But he was heavyset,

01:57.050 --> 02:00.053
it was really dark,
i didn't want them to see me.

02:00.053 --> 02:01.554
I heard gunshots,

02:01.554 --> 02:03.056
but i thought it was
kids with firecrackers.

02:03.056 --> 02:04.557
And then when two men
drove out in a car,

02:05.058 --> 02:06.059
i crouched down
in the ragweed.

02:06.059 --> 02:07.060
Sure.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.562
It began to dawn on me
what had happened.

02:09.562 --> 02:11.564
Like i told
the responding officers,

02:12.065 --> 02:13.066
i didn't finish
changing the tire.

02:13.066 --> 02:14.567
I walked to a phone,
called right away.

02:14.567 --> 02:16.069
Thank you.

02:16.569 --> 02:18.571
I'm so goddamn
fed up with crime.

02:18.571 --> 02:20.573
I'd hate myself if
i didn't come forward

02:21.074 --> 02:22.075
and help you put
these people behind bars.

02:22.075 --> 02:25.578
Thanks to people like you,
we may just do that.

02:25.578 --> 02:27.580
May i ask who
the dead man was?

02:28.081 --> 02:30.083
Just a poor kid, got hooked up
with the wrong crowd.

02:30.583 --> 02:31.584
Crack?

02:31.584 --> 02:33.086
Something like that.

02:55.608 --> 02:58.111
Mommy!

02:58.611 --> 02:59.612
Mommy!

02:59.612 --> 03:00.613
Mommy!

03:00.613 --> 03:05.568
Mommy, no!

03:06.035 --> 03:07.487
Mommy.

03:13.993 --> 03:15.995
Hey, what's the matter,
you lost?

03:15.995 --> 03:16.996
Uh- huh.

03:16.996 --> 03:19.499
You scared me
half to death.

03:19.499 --> 03:21.501
I can't turn
my back for a minute.

03:21.501 --> 03:23.002
I know what that's like.

03:23.002 --> 03:30.009
My little guy was
a real cadet at his age.

03:30.009 --> 03:31.010
Tony.

03:31.010 --> 03:32.011
Yeah.

03:32.011 --> 03:33.513
It's good you
could meet me.

03:34.013 --> 03:35.014
No problem.

03:35.515 --> 03:37.016
I went over to brookstone
and i got myself a scale.

03:37.517 --> 03:38.518
What do you want
to talk about?

03:39.018 --> 03:40.019
Dick barone

03:40.019 --> 03:42.522
as long as the two
of you are happy

03:42.522 --> 03:43.523
i'm in no mood.

03:44.023 --> 03:45.525
This freaking
garbage business...

03:45.525 --> 03:48.027
i found out that bow tie
wearin' bloodsucker's

03:48.027 --> 03:50.029
charging me twice as much
as everybody else

03:50.029 --> 03:52.031
to tip my trucks
at his place.

03:52.532 --> 03:54.033
So, you'll pad the tonnage,

03:54.033 --> 03:56.536
and you charge your townships
a little extra for the pick up.

03:56.536 --> 03:58.037
That's all.

03:58.037 --> 04:00.540
I got the smallest
amount of roots

04:00.540 --> 04:02.542
of anybody in
the association.

04:02.542 --> 04:05.545
You're like the old woman who'
got a virginia ham under her arm

04:05.545 --> 04:08.047
and she goes around crying
'cause she's got no bread.

04:08.047 --> 04:09.549
What the hell?

04:09.549 --> 04:11.050
Never mind,
the point is...

04:11.551 --> 04:15.054
your brother, jackie, he never
concentrated on sanitation,

04:15.054 --> 04:16.555
so, what do you
want dick to do?

04:16.555 --> 04:18.057
I want a rate.

04:18.558 --> 04:20.059
Alright, i'll see
what he says.

04:20.059 --> 04:21.560
Yeah.

04:21.560 --> 04:22.562
You see.

04:22.562 --> 04:25.565
Since you own part
of the company.

04:33.072 --> 04:34.574
Did you shut
all the lights?

04:34.574 --> 04:35.074
Yeah.

04:35.575 --> 04:36.075
In the kitchen?

04:36.576 --> 04:40.079
Yeah.

04:40.079 --> 04:42.081
I want to spend
more time with a. J.

04:42.081 --> 04:44.083
It's the other one
you should spend time with.

04:44.083 --> 04:45.084
She's almost
out of the house.

04:45.585 --> 04:47.587
Hey, i'm not worried
about meadow.

04:47.587 --> 04:53.092
Meadow can take care
of herself.

04:53.092 --> 04:55.094
Why this sudden
burst of fatherhood?

04:55.595 --> 05:00.600
Can you say anything
without it being sarcastic?

05:00.600 --> 05:04.604
You're right,
i'm sorry.

05:04.604 --> 05:06.105
I think it's
a good idea.

05:06.105 --> 05:07.607
He adores you.

05:07.607 --> 05:09.108
He never gets to spend
enough time with you.

05:09.609 --> 05:11.611
Yeah, well...

05:12.111 --> 05:14.113
i was reading in "time"
the other day,

05:14.113 --> 05:15.114
this study at harvard.

05:15.114 --> 05:18.618
The father's support
is absolutely linked

05:18.618 --> 05:21.621
to a boy's later capacity
to manage frustrations,

05:21.621 --> 05:25.625
to explore new circumstances,
and to do well in school.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.126
Kid needs to
toughen up.

05:27.126 --> 05:28.628
I'm not talking
about toughening up,

05:29.128 --> 05:30.129
i'm talking about
opening up.

05:30.129 --> 05:31.631
Somebody needs to teach that kid
some street smarts

05:31.631 --> 05:33.633
and not to be a sucker.

05:34.133 --> 05:36.135
And not to be involved
with the wrong people.

05:36.135 --> 05:38.638
I don't want another
christopher on my hands.

05:38.638 --> 05:41.641
I mean, look at him,
he's lucky to be alive.

05:41.641 --> 05:47.647
That other poor prick,
they found dead.

05:47.647 --> 05:49.649
Kid was 23
or something.

05:59.158 --> 06:00.660
Hey pal,
with the ramlosa.

06:00.660 --> 06:02.662
Put three cases
of that in my car.

06:02.662 --> 06:04.163
Got it.

06:04.163 --> 06:05.665
That's not a mistake.

06:05.665 --> 06:10.169
No, i want another 14 gross
of the model number 4784.

06:10.169 --> 06:12.672
Plastic picnic cooler,
just ship them.

06:12.672 --> 06:14.173
I'll worry about
selling them.

06:14.173 --> 06:15.174
Red.

06:15.174 --> 06:18.177
Forget blue,
red sells.

06:18.177 --> 06:19.178
Put it here.

06:19.178 --> 06:21.180
Put that on
the store tab.

06:21.681 --> 06:24.684
He says take three gross
of the blue coolers,

06:24.684 --> 06:25.685
he'll give us
a price on the red.

06:25.685 --> 06:27.186
Screw that.

06:27.186 --> 06:29.188
He's never getting
paid anyway.

06:29.188 --> 06:30.690
They got to be all red.

06:30.690 --> 06:32.692
Yeah, just do it,
please?

06:32.692 --> 06:33.693
Thank you.

06:33.693 --> 06:34.694
Goodbye.

06:34.694 --> 06:37.196
Who gets chicken
and peppers?

06:37.196 --> 06:39.699
A lot of freakin' work
to move some picnic coolers.

06:40.199 --> 06:41.200
Coolers are
like scissors.

06:41.701 --> 06:43.202
Everybody wants one.

06:43.202 --> 06:45.705
Nobody has a freakin' idea
how much they cost.

06:45.705 --> 06:48.207
You put a nigerian
out on the street,

06:48.207 --> 06:51.210
have them sell these for
a couple, three bucks a piece.

06:51.210 --> 06:54.714
Who's not gonna say,
"screw it, give me one."

06:54.714 --> 06:57.216
Davey, how we doin' with them
books of airline tickets?

06:57.216 --> 07:00.219
Won't it raise a red flag
with the travel agency?

07:00.219 --> 07:02.722
A sporting goods store charges
airline tickets in bulk?

07:02.722 --> 07:05.224
You say it's
a promotional device.

07:05.224 --> 07:07.727
You know, customer of the year,
salesman of the month.

07:08.227 --> 07:09.228
That kind of thing.

07:09.228 --> 07:10.730
Don't worry about it.

07:10.730 --> 07:12.732
You put it on different
lines of credit.

07:12.732 --> 07:13.733
Yeah, but all of a sudden,

07:14.233 --> 07:15.234
i'm ordering all
this weird shit,

07:15.234 --> 07:18.738
i mean, picnic coolers,
ramlosa water.

07:18.738 --> 07:22.241
When's one of
these vendors gonna realize

07:22.742 --> 07:24.243
i'm never gonna pay'em
and call the cops?

07:24.243 --> 07:25.745
When your freakin' credit
runs out, diamond jim.

07:26.245 --> 07:28.748
Until then, get on
the freakin' horn and order.

07:29.248 --> 07:34.253
Unless you're ready to pay us
the principle you owe us.

07:34.253 --> 07:37.757
Hey!

07:37.757 --> 07:40.760
Put the heat up.

07:40.760 --> 07:45.765
Today!

07:45.765 --> 07:47.266
Oh, jeez!

07:47.767 --> 07:48.768
What's the matter?

07:48.768 --> 07:51.771
Spider.

07:51.771 --> 07:53.272
So, kill it.

07:53.272 --> 07:55.274
Uh- uh, you do it.

07:55.274 --> 07:57.777
Come here and kill
the freakin' thing.

08:04.283 --> 08:05.284
Come here.

08:05.284 --> 08:05.785
No way.

08:05.785 --> 08:09.789
No, c'mon.

08:09.789 --> 08:12.291
It was a leaf,
you freakin' idiot.

08:12.291 --> 08:13.793
Mister?

08:13.793 --> 08:14.794
Yeah.

08:14.794 --> 08:16.295
Some man here
to see you.

08:16.295 --> 08:17.296
Who?

08:17.797 --> 08:21.801
The police.

08:21.801 --> 08:23.302
Be right back.

08:28.808 --> 08:31.811
Did you let them in the house?

08:31.811 --> 08:35.815
"Warrant."
How do you say it
in fuckin' polish?

08:41.320 --> 08:43.322
Agent harris.

08:43.322 --> 08:44.824
Who's your friend?

08:44.824 --> 08:47.326
I'm detective
harold giardina.

08:47.326 --> 08:48.828
From the essex
county task force.

08:48.828 --> 08:50.329
Well, i'm pleased
to meet you.

08:50.329 --> 08:51.831
But if you don't
have a warrant,

08:52.331 --> 08:53.833
could you get the hell
out of my house?
'Cause i'm kind of busy.

08:53.833 --> 08:54.834
I can see that.

08:54.834 --> 08:55.835
Oh, you're a comedian.

08:56.335 --> 08:57.336
Is that how you
broke your nose?

08:57.336 --> 08:58.838
Tony, we could
have phoned.

08:59.338 --> 09:00.339
We paid you the courtesy
of a visit.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.842
We want you to come down
to the station to talk.

09:02.842 --> 09:03.843
To talk.

09:03.843 --> 09:06.345
About matthew bevilaqua.

09:06.345 --> 09:07.847
Dad?

09:07.847 --> 09:08.848
Take the backboard
out of the cabana.

09:08.848 --> 09:14.353
I'll be down there
in a couple of minutes.

09:14.353 --> 09:16.856
Look a lawyer up,
come in one on one,
it's your call.

09:16.856 --> 09:18.357
Just name a time
at your convenience.

09:18.357 --> 09:19.358
On your way out,

09:19.859 --> 09:21.360
you think you can roll
the garbages down the hill?

09:21.360 --> 09:23.863
Tomorrow's pick up day.

09:24.363 --> 09:30.870
Let's go, harry.

09:30.870 --> 09:33.372
So those were those fbi guys
that were here before.

09:33.372 --> 09:34.874
What did they want?

09:34.874 --> 09:36.876
Nothing.

09:37.376 --> 09:38.878
Keep this between us,
alright?

09:38.878 --> 09:41.013
You know how
your mother gets.

09:59.899 --> 10:03.402
What do yo
u got for me?

10:03.402 --> 10:07.406
Partial list of the major
investors in webistics.

10:07.406 --> 10:09.909
Other than that, i haven't
seen tony in a while.

10:09.909 --> 10:12.912
You mean, besides the night
tony capped the bevilaqua kid.

10:12.912 --> 10:14.914
What are you
talking about?

10:14.914 --> 10:16.415
Did you fuck me?
Did you fuck me?

10:16.916 --> 10:17.416
Take it easy.

10:17.917 --> 10:18.918
Take it easy?

10:19.418 --> 10:21.921
How about i put a bullet
in that boars head of yours?

10:21.921 --> 10:23.923
He was spotted, sal.

10:23.923 --> 10:25.424
So, don't go
pulling my taffy.

10:25.925 --> 10:27.927
'Cause at this second,
if you lie to me,

10:28.427 --> 10:32.431
you will never see
the streets where you live
for 50 freakin' years.

10:32.932 --> 10:34.433
Did you know
about this?

10:34.934 --> 10:36.435
No.

10:36.435 --> 10:38.437
If you knew he was
planning something...

10:38.437 --> 10:40.940
...and didn't tell me,
and didn't wear a wire--

10:40.940 --> 10:42.441
i told you,"no."

10:48.447 --> 10:50.449
Well, there was
someone else with tony

10:50.449 --> 10:51.951
the night he shot
the kid up.

10:51.951 --> 10:55.955
A quote- unquote
husky accomplice.

10:55.955 --> 10:56.455
Yeah?

10:56.455 --> 10:57.456
Yeah.

10:57.957 --> 11:00.960
But the witness
couldn't i. D. Him.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.962
Were you the prep
the witness couldn't make?

11:02.962 --> 11:05.464
What are you talking about?
Are you crazy?

11:05.464 --> 11:08.467
What'd i tell you?
No fucking violence.

11:08.467 --> 11:13.973
I oughta burn you right
now and let the judge
throw away the key.

11:13.973 --> 11:15.975
I'm gonna decide
to believe you, okay?

11:16.475 --> 11:17.977
But here's what
you're gonna do for me.

11:17.977 --> 11:20.479
I want to hear tony's
voice on tape, sal, saying,

11:20.479 --> 11:21.981
"i killed matthew bevilaqua."

11:22.481 --> 11:25.484
No distortions,
no throat- clearings,
no fucking nose- blowings.

11:25.484 --> 11:28.487
Okay, i get it.
But let me ask you something:

11:28.487 --> 11:31.490
If i did ride with tony
on something like that,

11:31.490 --> 11:34.493
don't you think it would only
get me tighter with him,

11:34.493 --> 11:35.494
raise my coinage?

11:35.995 --> 11:37.496
Make tony forget
all his suspicions?

11:37.496 --> 11:39.498
You're a cute prick, puss,
i'll give you that.

11:39.999 --> 11:44.503
Get me tony on tape
talking about this murder.

11:44.503 --> 11:46.505
So, who's the witness?

11:46.505 --> 11:49.008
No joke, sal.

11:49.008 --> 11:56.515
You don't want to
see my darker side.

11:56.515 --> 11:57.516
Go.

11:57.516 --> 11:59.518
If they had enough
to pinch you for,

11:59.518 --> 12:01.520
there'd be bars between us
right as we speak.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.022
Why do they want me
to go down there?

12:03.022 --> 12:05.024
Lock you into a story,
any story.

12:05.024 --> 12:10.529
So, later at trial,
any contradiction'll sink you.

12:10.529 --> 12:12.531
Are we gonna go?
Did you say you'd go?

12:12.531 --> 12:14.533
Please.

12:14.533 --> 12:15.534
Alright.

12:15.534 --> 12:16.535
Procrastinate.

12:17.036 --> 12:18.037
Let me get
our ducks in a row.

12:18.537 --> 12:19.538
In the meantime,

12:19.538 --> 12:21.540
keep your cool
and go the speed limit.

12:21.540 --> 12:24.543
Don't give them an in.

12:24.543 --> 12:28.047
What'd i just say?

12:28.047 --> 12:29.548
Don't give them an in.

12:29.548 --> 12:34.053
Are you alright, tony?

12:34.553 --> 12:36.555
This is some bad shit here.

12:36.555 --> 12:38.557
What's up, anthony?

12:38.557 --> 12:40.059
How did
this happen?

12:40.559 --> 12:42.061
Mid- life crisis?

12:42.561 --> 12:45.064
You can talk to me.

12:45.564 --> 12:48.067
The mothers last year
said we should end senior night

12:48.567 --> 12:50.069
at sunrise at
long beach island.

12:50.069 --> 12:52.571
That way they can dance,
they'll do the scavenger hunt

12:52.571 --> 12:54.073
and the liquor stores'll
be closed.

12:54.073 --> 12:55.074
We count noses.

12:55.074 --> 12:56.075
Yeah, okay.

12:56.075 --> 12:57.576
Jeez,
is that the time?

12:57.576 --> 12:59.578
I'm gonna barely
get natalie to tap.

12:59.578 --> 13:01.080
Chris, need a ride?

13:01.080 --> 13:02.081
No, my brother's
coming to pick me up.

13:02.581 --> 13:04.083
Eric took my car
to a fencing meet.

13:04.583 --> 13:06.085
Alright, next week,
my house.

13:06.085 --> 13:08.587
We'll tie up
the loose ends.

13:26.105 --> 13:28.607
Christine, i'm so glad
you stayed behind.

13:28.607 --> 13:30.109
I kind of
wanted to.

13:30.109 --> 13:32.111
When i found out
about eric's car,

13:32.611 --> 13:34.613
i told tony to
give it right back.

13:34.613 --> 13:36.615
I wish i could say
this is the first time

13:37.116 --> 13:39.118
dave has pulled a stunt
like this, but...

13:39.118 --> 13:42.621
uh...

13:42.621 --> 13:45.124
eric is going
to college

13:45.124 --> 13:48.627
and maybe it's better
for his grades
he doesn't have a car.

13:48.627 --> 13:50.129
So, april 1st, huh?

13:50.129 --> 13:51.630
How i dread it.

13:51.630 --> 13:53.132
Just so long as eric
gets into georgetown.

13:53.632 --> 13:54.133
It's his first choice.

13:54.633 --> 13:55.134
I wish it was meadow's.

13:55.634 --> 13:57.136
She wants to go
to berkeley.

14:01.640 --> 14:02.141
Hi.

14:02.641 --> 14:03.642
We just finished.

14:03.642 --> 14:05.144
I'm sorry i'm late.

14:05.144 --> 14:06.145
I was bidding
a job in rumson.

14:06.645 --> 14:08.647
My brother,
the artist with wallpaper.

14:08.647 --> 14:11.150
The only one you trust
with your brunswick and fields.

14:11.150 --> 14:13.152
Vic, carmela soprano.

14:13.152 --> 14:14.153
Victor musto.

14:14.153 --> 14:14.653
Nice to meet you.

14:14.653 --> 14:16.155
You too.

14:16.155 --> 14:18.157
You have
a beautiful house here.

14:18.157 --> 14:19.658
Oh, thank you.

14:19.658 --> 14:21.160
Not that it couldn't use
a little freshening up.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.661
Vic does amazing
border work too.

14:22.661 --> 14:25.664
Actually, i was thinking
of doing some wallpaper

14:25.664 --> 14:26.665
in the dining room.

14:26.665 --> 14:28.167
Do you have
a card, vic?

14:28.167 --> 14:29.168
Yeah.

14:29.168 --> 14:30.669
Sure.

14:30.669 --> 14:36.675
I'm bonded, state certified,
but i'm still dangerous.

14:36.675 --> 14:38.677
Well bye, carmela,
thanks.

14:38.677 --> 14:40.679
Well, let's get together soon
and have lunch, okay?

14:40.679 --> 14:42.181
Have you tried
the new vesuvio?

14:42.181 --> 14:42.681
No.

14:43.182 --> 14:44.183
Okay, lunch,
promise.

14:44.183 --> 14:48.187
Yes.

14:48.187 --> 14:49.688
Nice meeting you.

14:49.688 --> 14:52.691
Oh, you too, and i'm gonna call
about the wallpaper.

14:59.198 --> 15:00.699
Nice lady.

15:00.699 --> 15:02.201
Don't even
think about it.

15:02.201 --> 15:05.204
She's married to
tony soprano.

15:05.204 --> 15:07.706
Married's good
enough for me.

15:07.706 --> 15:09.708
Who her husband is
doesn't matter.

15:09.708 --> 15:10.709
I respect the ring.

15:10.709 --> 15:12.211
Oh, especially that ring.

15:12.211 --> 15:14.213
Probably came off
a dead person's finger.

15:29.728 --> 15:31.730
David, are you
down there?

15:31.730 --> 15:33.732
Be right up.

15:42.741 --> 15:43.742
What are you
doing up there?

15:44.243 --> 15:45.744
I'm fixing the freakin
' lightbulb, that's all!

15:46.245 --> 15:47.746
It's glares out
the "one" ball when i rack.

15:47.746 --> 15:49.248
Jesus, okay.

15:49.248 --> 15:50.749
You're the one
that's always worried

15:50.749 --> 15:52.751
about somebody
ruining the felt.

16:06.765 --> 16:09.768
Oh, richie, oh, baby,
you're the best.

16:09.768 --> 16:14.773
Oh, you're the best.
One ever.

16:14.773 --> 16:18.777
Oh, baby, you're the best.
Oh, baby, you're the best.

16:18.777 --> 16:21.280
Oh, richie.
Oh, richie.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.282
Oh, baby, you're the boss.

16:23.782 --> 16:25.784
Oh, you're the boss!

16:25.784 --> 16:27.286
Oh, baby.

16:27.286 --> 16:29.288
Oh, you're the best.

16:29.788 --> 16:31.790
Oh, oh,
it should be you.

16:31.790 --> 16:33.292
Oh.

16:33.292 --> 16:34.793
It should be you.

16:34.793 --> 16:36.795
Oh.

16:36.795 --> 16:38.797
What?

16:38.797 --> 16:40.299
Where'd that
come from?

16:40.299 --> 16:41.300
What?

16:41.300 --> 16:42.801
"It should be you"?

16:42.801 --> 16:45.804
What are you trying
to say, janice?

16:45.804 --> 16:46.805
What?

16:46.805 --> 16:51.810
Don't "what" me!

16:51.810 --> 16:53.312
Why'd you say that?

16:53.312 --> 16:57.316
I was making love
to you, baby.

16:57.816 --> 16:59.318
You know what you said.

16:59.318 --> 17:04.323
I was in the heat of passion,
i'm doing it like you like.

17:04.823 --> 17:06.325
"Boss" this.

17:06.325 --> 17:07.826
"Boss" that.

17:08.327 --> 17:11.329
"Should be you."

17:11.329 --> 17:12.830
That's not part of it.

17:12.830 --> 17:15.334
How can you think of
stuff like that during sex?

17:15.834 --> 17:17.836
You're not in the moment.

17:27.846 --> 17:30.349
I find powerful
men erotic.

17:30.349 --> 17:32.351
Is that another
dig in me?

17:32.351 --> 17:34.353
Oh, jesus, richie.

17:42.861 --> 17:45.864
I gotta be loyal.

17:45.864 --> 17:51.370
Without that,
we crumble.

17:51.370 --> 17:54.873
Tell that to
paul castellano.

18:00.879 --> 18:03.382
I'm old school, janice.

18:03.382 --> 18:07.886
All i mean is
my brother needs help.

18:07.886 --> 18:10.889
Teaching him
manners is one thing.

18:10.889 --> 18:12.891
My uncle junior
still has friends

18:12.891 --> 18:16.895
and junior thinks
the world of you.

18:23.902 --> 18:27.406
When your opponent
gives you an opening,

18:27.406 --> 18:30.909
be swift as a hare.

18:30.909 --> 18:35.914
When i think of that jacket
i gave your brother

18:35.914 --> 18:40.419
and he spit on it.

18:40.419 --> 18:43.422
I could slice an ear
off his head.

18:43.422 --> 18:45.924
Richie wait,
wha--

18:45.924 --> 18:49.928
ma, if you need something,
call, i'll bring it up.

18:49.928 --> 18:52.431
Are you smoking
marijuana?

18:52.431 --> 18:54.933
I want to watch the tv.

18:54.933 --> 18:56.935
Well, we should get
another one for your room.

18:56.935 --> 18:58.437
Listen to her.

18:58.437 --> 19:00.439
Like rose kennedy

19:00.439 --> 19:05.944
with all our money
to throw around.

19:54.493 --> 19:55.994
Gives me agita.

19:55.994 --> 19:56.995
They want me to
go downtown.

19:57.496 --> 19:58.497
Lock you into a story.

19:58.497 --> 19:59.998
And if they
do have something,

19:59.998 --> 20:01.500
why the hell ain't
they talking to you?

20:02.000 --> 20:08.006
Give them time,
they will.

20:08.006 --> 20:10.509
Murder and
aid of racketeering.

20:10.509 --> 20:17.015
20 to life.

20:17.015 --> 20:18.517
There they are.

20:18.517 --> 20:24.022
The flying
garvone brothers.

20:24.022 --> 20:25.023
Not good.

20:25.023 --> 20:26.525
Not good.

20:26.525 --> 20:29.027
On my freakin' kids,
i will freakin' cut you.

20:29.027 --> 20:30.028
Just tell me.

20:30.028 --> 20:32.531
Take it easy, ton',
it's fixable.

20:33.031 --> 20:35.033
First off,
it's not a rat.

20:35.534 --> 20:36.535
Thank god.

20:36.535 --> 20:38.036
Don't thank him yet.

20:38.036 --> 20:41.540
There's an
eyeball witness.

20:41.540 --> 20:44.543
What're you
talking about?

20:44.543 --> 20:47.546
Jesus christ.

20:47.546 --> 20:48.547
Did you see anybody?

20:49.047 --> 20:50.549
Another freakin'
living soul?

20:50.549 --> 20:51.550
No.

20:52.050 --> 20:53.552
Don't worry,
a mere bump in the road.

20:54.052 --> 20:55.554
Oh, you're beautiful.

20:55.554 --> 20:57.055
Who, do we know him?

20:57.055 --> 21:00.058
All my friend
at the station knows
is that he's a civilian.

21:00.559 --> 21:02.561
A flag- saluting
bloodsucker.

21:02.561 --> 21:05.564
Maybe you should
"lamb chop it" for a while.

21:05.564 --> 21:07.566
I keep a suitcase
in my truck.

21:08.066 --> 21:09.067
Yeah,
tell us about it.

21:09.067 --> 21:10.068
Forget all of yous.

21:10.569 --> 21:12.070
Bygones are
never bygones.

21:12.070 --> 21:13.572
This is
a freakin' nightmare.

21:13.572 --> 21:15.574
I have to move
some cash around.

21:15.574 --> 21:17.576
If i'm gonna lam it, i'm going
with a freakin' package.

21:17.576 --> 21:19.077
I'm not gonna
be like mickey marsucal.

21:19.077 --> 21:21.079
That poor jerk, he had
five freakin' minutes to run.

21:21.580 --> 21:25.083
He ended up in some
rat- infested motel
down in elvis country.

21:25.083 --> 21:26.585
Where is that?

21:26.585 --> 21:30.088
Anywhere there are
no jews or italians.

21:30.088 --> 21:31.089
I don't get it.

21:31.089 --> 21:34.092
It's starting!
It's already starting!

21:34.092 --> 21:35.594
Get back in
your office, david!

21:35.594 --> 21:37.596
I'm opening my mail
and it's a lawsuit!

21:37.596 --> 21:39.097
It's a freakin'
lean on the building,

21:39.598 --> 21:40.599
they're gonna
close me down!

21:40.599 --> 21:42.100
Davey, not
fucking now, okay?

21:42.100 --> 21:44.102
They're gonna know after this
that it's fraud.

21:44.102 --> 21:45.604
I'm gonna
go to jail for this!

21:45.604 --> 21:49.608
Get the fuck back
in your fucking hole, now!

21:57.616 --> 22:00.118
Davey...

22:00.118 --> 22:02.621
you're doing
a good job!

22:13.632 --> 22:18.637
Don't worry about
this witness, t.

22:19.137 --> 22:20.138
Exactly.

22:20.138 --> 22:22.140
You don't even know
what he said.

22:22.140 --> 22:23.141
Fuck you,
i did too.

22:23.141 --> 22:24.142
What, then?

22:24.142 --> 22:25.644
I understood.

22:25.644 --> 22:26.645
What's it mean?

22:26.645 --> 22:34.152
It means sit on this,
cocksucker!

22:34.152 --> 22:35.654
Five minutes
away from the can

22:35.654 --> 22:37.656
for the rest of my fucking life
and i'm laughing.

22:37.656 --> 22:39.658
You gotta, skip,
you gotta.

22:39.658 --> 22:42.160
It's been months since
davey took me to dinner.

22:42.661 --> 22:46.164
When you're dating
it's all candles and wine.

22:46.665 --> 22:49.167
Dave's been even more
preoccupied than usual lately.

22:49.167 --> 22:52.170
He's busy.

22:52.170 --> 22:55.173
Carmela,
my husband has a disease,

22:55.173 --> 22:57.175
a serious
gambling problem.

22:57.175 --> 22:58.176
I am so sorry.

22:58.176 --> 22:59.678
Thank god the store's
in my name.

22:59.678 --> 23:01.680
He can't sell the business
without me

23:01.680 --> 23:03.181
or he would've gambled
it all away by now.

23:03.181 --> 23:05.684
But i'm gonna make sure
we get through this.

23:05.684 --> 23:07.686
Uh- uh.

23:07.686 --> 23:10.188
Give me those.

23:10.188 --> 23:13.191
I'm gonna make you
two beautiful women

23:13.191 --> 23:15.193
a special
tasting menu.

23:15.193 --> 23:16.695
I was hoping
he would say that.

23:17.195 --> 23:18.196
Now i know you
ordered the pelligrino,

23:18.196 --> 23:21.199
but i want you
to try this.

23:21.199 --> 23:25.704
I got such a deal
on this ramlosa.

23:26.204 --> 23:28.206
It was so nice to meet
your brother the other day.

23:28.707 --> 23:30.208
He seems like
a very interesting person.

23:30.208 --> 23:31.710
Vic's a doll.

23:31.710 --> 23:34.212
When his wife was dying,
he waited on her
hand and foot.

23:34.212 --> 23:35.714
Really?
A widower?

23:36.214 --> 23:37.716
So young.

23:37.716 --> 23:39.718
Breast cancer.

23:39.718 --> 23:43.221
I thought there was
a sadness about him.

23:43.221 --> 23:43.722
Yeah.

23:43.722 --> 23:44.723
And the children?

23:45.223 --> 23:45.724
Childless.

23:46.224 --> 23:48.226
She had
a hostile womb.

23:48.226 --> 23:49.728
I had a dream
about him.

23:49.728 --> 23:50.729
You did?

23:51.229 --> 23:52.230
Christine...

23:52.230 --> 23:53.732
well, he asked me
about you too.

23:53.732 --> 23:55.734
He was wallpapering
my dining room.

23:55.734 --> 23:57.736
Oh, well, the dream
was your subconscious

23:57.736 --> 23:58.737
telling you
you want to have him

23:59.237 --> 24:01.239
wallpaper your dining room,
that's all.

24:09.247 --> 24:14.252
Hey, go- gootz!

24:14.252 --> 24:15.253
I got something
for you.

24:15.754 --> 24:16.755
What?

24:16.755 --> 24:18.757
What?
A rod and
a penn international reel.

24:18.757 --> 24:20.258
Thanks.

24:20.258 --> 24:21.760
You wanted it for christmas
last year, remember?

24:21.760 --> 24:23.261
We couldn't get it,
it was back- ordered.

24:23.261 --> 24:25.263
Well i got
a great deal on them.

24:25.764 --> 24:27.265
We'll, take the boat,
we'll go out fishing.

24:27.265 --> 24:28.266
Okay.

24:28.767 --> 24:29.768
What are you
doing now?

24:29.768 --> 24:31.770
You want
to go fishing now?

24:32.270 --> 24:35.774
No, no, i'd figure
we'd see a movie or something,

24:35.774 --> 24:36.274
get some pizza.

24:36.775 --> 24:37.275
I can't.

24:37.776 --> 24:38.777
What do you mean
you can't?

24:38.777 --> 24:41.780
I'm going
to the mall.

24:41.780 --> 24:43.782
You can't see a movie'cause
you gotta go to the mall?

24:44.282 --> 24:45.283
Not just me,

24:45.283 --> 24:48.286
brad, alan, heidi,
her sister maybe.

24:48.286 --> 24:49.788
Like a double date.

24:49.788 --> 24:52.791
No, dad, okay?

24:52.791 --> 24:55.293
We're just going to the mall,
we go there sometimes.

24:55.293 --> 24:57.295
And do what?

24:57.295 --> 25:00.298
I don't know,
get something to eat,
some mrs. Fields.

25:00.298 --> 25:03.802
Anyway, i gotta go,
i'm meeting them there.

25:03.802 --> 25:04.803
Alright.

25:04.803 --> 25:07.806
Go ahead.

25:07.806 --> 25:12.811
See you later.

25:12.811 --> 25:14.813
Yeah, my girl
did the same thing...

25:14.813 --> 25:16.815
at his age.

25:16.815 --> 25:18.817
Boys and girls
always in a group,

25:18.817 --> 25:20.318
what's that about?

25:20.318 --> 25:22.320
What's it about
for you?

25:22.320 --> 25:24.823
In my day a boy and a girl
went on a date.

25:24.823 --> 25:27.325
And your father hoped
you wouldn't get too far

25:27.325 --> 25:29.327
or else you'd get
the girl knocked up

25:29.327 --> 25:32.330
and her parents would come over
and break your legs.

25:32.330 --> 25:34.332
I don't think
it's about him

25:34.833 --> 25:37.335
going to mall with a group
that bothered you.

25:37.836 --> 25:40.338
Wasn't it that
he was going to mall

25:40.338 --> 25:42.841
instead of going
to the movies with you?

25:42.841 --> 25:45.844
He's getting to that age
where he's got
a life of his own.

25:45.844 --> 25:47.846
One that
doesn't include you.

25:47.846 --> 25:50.849
It's always,"we'll do this,
we're gonna do that".

25:50.849 --> 25:52.851
Not so fast,

25:52.851 --> 25:55.854
i've heard you talk many times
about being with your son.

25:56.354 --> 25:57.856
Yeah well,
that's over now.

25:58.356 --> 25:59.858
Gone, done.

25:59.858 --> 26:01.860
It's bittersweet,
this period.

26:02.360 --> 26:04.362
You're glad that
they're growing up,

26:04.362 --> 26:06.364
but you're sad
to lose them.

26:18.877 --> 26:20.879
I could be
going away...

26:20.879 --> 26:24.883
for a very
long time.

26:25.383 --> 26:31.389
For something
i didn't do.

26:31.389 --> 26:33.391
How about,
"gee, that's too bad, anthony",

26:33.391 --> 26:34.893
or "what a shame, tony"?

26:34.893 --> 26:37.395
We can't go into
specifics on this.

26:37.395 --> 26:39.397
Here's something
specific,

26:39.397 --> 26:40.398
i didn't
do anything wrong.

26:40.398 --> 26:41.900
We're not supposed
to talk about it.

26:42.400 --> 26:45.403
I could be going to can
for the rest of my fucking life.

26:45.403 --> 26:48.907
And i'm not
supposed to discuss it
with my psychiatrist?

26:49.407 --> 26:55.413
What the fuck
are you for, anyway?

26:55.413 --> 26:57.415
How does that
make you feel,

26:57.415 --> 26:59.918
the idea that you might
be sent to prison?

27:07.425 --> 27:12.931
I just gotta stay around
a little while longer
for the kids.

27:13.431 --> 27:16.935
Especially my boy.

27:16.935 --> 27:18.436
Once he's out
of the house

27:18.436 --> 27:20.939
the government can do
whatever the fuck
they want to do.

27:20.939 --> 27:22.941
Give me life,
give me the fucking chair,

27:22.941 --> 27:23.942
whatever they want.

27:23.942 --> 27:25.443
I've never
seen you like this.

27:25.443 --> 27:26.444
Like what?

27:26.444 --> 27:31.449
Scared.

27:31.449 --> 27:33.451
You know, i wouldn't
use that word.

27:33.451 --> 27:34.953
But sometimes i feel...

27:34.953 --> 27:37.956
i don't know,
i don't know.

27:37.956 --> 27:44.462
You motherfuckers,
you motherfuckers!

27:44.963 --> 27:48.466
I don't fucking
deserve this.

27:55.473 --> 28:01.479
How's your medication?

28:01.479 --> 28:02.981
Maybe we should stop.

28:16.995 --> 28:17.996
What?

28:17.996 --> 28:22.000
Don't have
the witness yet.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.501
Nothing.

28:23.501 --> 28:25.003
This is
the fbi, ton'.

28:25.503 --> 28:28.006
Local cops, you buy them
a christmas tree,

28:28.006 --> 28:29.507
they'll give you
their grandmother.

28:29.507 --> 28:36.014
But you know how tight these
fed cocksuckers can keep it.

28:36.014 --> 28:38.016
Alright go home,
get some sleep.

28:38.516 --> 28:40.518
You don't want to
stop by "the bing",

28:40.518 --> 28:41.519
get something
to eat or something?

28:41.519 --> 28:43.021
No.

28:43.021 --> 28:46.024
Just tell me, t,
what do you want me to do?

28:46.024 --> 28:47.025
Just let me think.

28:47.025 --> 28:51.029
C'mon.

28:51.029 --> 28:52.530
Alright.

29:27.065 --> 29:28.066
Tony.

29:28.066 --> 29:29.567
What are you
doing here?

29:29.567 --> 29:32.070
I could ask you
the same fucking question.

29:32.070 --> 29:34.572
It's my store.

29:34.572 --> 29:39.577
Congratulations,
it's a fucking disaster.

29:39.577 --> 29:41.579
Hey, some of those
airline tickets came in.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.581
You and me split them
with you and richie.

29:43.581 --> 29:49.087
They're mine,
it's my idea.

29:49.087 --> 29:50.588
That's where
you sleep?

29:50.588 --> 29:52.090
Yeah, sometimes.

29:52.090 --> 29:54.592
It's easier
than going home.

29:55.093 --> 29:56.594
I know
what you mean.

30:06.104 --> 30:10.108
I remember when you transferred
into 10th grade from...

30:10.108 --> 30:13.611
boden boden.

30:13.611 --> 30:18.116
Fucking army brat.

30:18.116 --> 30:21.119
Hey, you remember when those
guidos from paterson,

30:21.619 --> 30:23.621
they caught you up
at garret mountain,

30:23.621 --> 30:25.623
they had you barricaded
in your old man's car

30:25.623 --> 30:27.625
and i whipped that rock
and hit that guy in the eye?

30:27.625 --> 30:33.631
Don't reminisce
on me.

30:33.631 --> 30:37.135
You told me not to
get in the game.

30:37.635 --> 30:42.640
Why'd you
let me do it?

30:42.640 --> 30:46.644
Well, i knew you had
this business here, davey.

30:46.644 --> 30:48.146
It's my nature.

30:48.146 --> 30:51.649
The frog and the scorpion,
you know?

30:51.649 --> 30:53.151
Besides, if
you would've won

30:53.651 --> 30:56.654
i'd be the one
crying the blues, right?

30:56.654 --> 30:58.656
What's the end?

30:58.656 --> 30:59.657
The end...

30:59.657 --> 31:01.659
it's planned
bankruptcy.

31:11.169 --> 31:13.171
Hey, you're not the first guy
to get busted out.

31:13.171 --> 31:15.173
This is how a guy like me
makes his living.

31:15.173 --> 31:18.176
This is
my bread and butter.

31:18.176 --> 31:20.678
When this is over
you're free to go.

31:20.678 --> 31:23.681
You can go
anywhere you want.

31:23.681 --> 31:26.184
Oh, for chrissake.

31:47.205 --> 31:48.206
Anthony!
Dig!

31:55.213 --> 31:59.217
Anthony!
Anthony, dig!

31:59.217 --> 32:00.218
C'mon!
Anthony!

32:09.227 --> 32:11.229
Oh, my god,
that was so exciting.

32:11.729 --> 32:14.232
If i wouldn't
have banged my foot,
i would've came in second.

32:14.732 --> 32:17.735
You were like
a fish out there.

32:17.735 --> 32:19.237
Where's dad?

32:19.237 --> 32:20.238
He couldn't
make it.

32:20.238 --> 32:21.739
Oh.

32:21.739 --> 32:22.740
He called, he had
a very important meeting,

32:22.740 --> 32:23.741
he'll be here
next time.

32:24.242 --> 32:25.243
This is the last meet
of the season.

32:25.243 --> 32:28.746
Next year,
i mean.

32:29.247 --> 32:30.748
Oh, okay.

32:43.261 --> 32:44.762
Got a safe?

32:44.762 --> 32:46.764
Yeah, why?

32:54.272 --> 32:56.274
You want to pay
in advance?

32:56.274 --> 32:57.775
There's a little over
400k in there.

32:57.775 --> 32:59.277
I want you
to hold it for me.

32:59.277 --> 33:02.280
This goes down,
i'm out of this area code.

33:02.280 --> 33:04.782
My wife's gonna
come in here once a week
for an allowance.

33:05.283 --> 33:10.288
You don't ask her any question
and you never ever refuse her.

33:10.288 --> 33:14.292
She wants it all...
you give it to her.

33:14.292 --> 33:17.295
But she won't do that,
carmela's smarter than that.

33:17.295 --> 33:19.297
And if you're gone
longer than the money lasts?

33:19.297 --> 33:22.300
Don't worry, you won't
have to go into your own kick.

33:22.300 --> 33:26.304
This witness can't remain
nameless forever.

33:26.304 --> 33:28.806
I didn't hear that.

33:35.313 --> 33:37.315
Don't you got
school tomorrow?

33:37.815 --> 33:39.317
So?

33:39.317 --> 33:42.320
So, it's late,
go to bed.

33:42.320 --> 33:45.823
Did you hear me?

33:52.330 --> 33:54.332
I hope you
apologize to him.

33:54.332 --> 33:55.833
For what?

33:55.833 --> 33:59.337
Tony, you promised him
you were gonna
be at his swim meet.

33:59.337 --> 34:00.838
Oh, shit,
i forgot.

34:00.838 --> 34:02.840
How could
you forget?

34:02.840 --> 34:04.842
Something
i had to do.

34:04.842 --> 34:06.844
Tony, he almos
t came in second.

34:06.844 --> 34:08.846
You should've seen his face
when you weren't there.

34:08.846 --> 34:10.848
I saw his face
the other day

34:10.848 --> 34:13.351
when he had to go to mall
when i wanted to
take him to movies.

34:13.351 --> 34:14.851
What are you
six years old?

34:15.353 --> 34:17.855
I said i'd try
to be there.

34:17.855 --> 34:19.857
What is
with you, tony?

34:19.857 --> 34:23.360
This whole week, you're like
an alien life- form among us.

34:23.360 --> 34:26.864
There's nothing wrong.

34:27.364 --> 34:28.866
Thank you
for sharing.

34:28.866 --> 34:31.369
You know what?
Leave me the fuck alone.

34:31.369 --> 34:32.870
I'm exhausted.

34:32.870 --> 34:35.873
I'll make it up to him,
the swim meet.

34:35.873 --> 34:36.873
So, where were you?

34:37.375 --> 34:38.876
Did you go see christopher
at the hospital?

34:38.876 --> 34:41.879
Yeah, i went to see
christopher at the hospital.

34:42.380 --> 34:43.380
Wherever you were,

34:43.380 --> 34:44.882
it couldn't have been
more important

34:44.882 --> 34:46.884
than letting your son know
that you care about him!

34:47.385 --> 34:49.387
No, only you care.

34:49.387 --> 34:50.888
Fuck you.

34:50.888 --> 34:51.889
No, fuck you!

34:51.889 --> 34:53.391
Fuck you!

34:53.891 --> 34:56.893
You fuck!

34:57.395 --> 34:59.897
What the fuck's
wrong with you?

35:42.940 --> 35:44.442
Hey.

35:44.442 --> 35:47.445
My god, you scared
the shit out of me.

35:47.445 --> 35:48.446
No.

35:48.446 --> 35:51.949
Shut'em off.

35:52.450 --> 35:54.452
Why are you
sitting in the dark?

35:54.452 --> 35:56.954
I don't know.

35:56.954 --> 35:58.956
I like the dark,
sit.

35:58.956 --> 36:00.458
I gotta
go online.

36:00.458 --> 36:01.459
Oh, c'mon.

36:01.459 --> 36:03.961
Sit for a minute,
c'mon.

36:13.971 --> 36:14.972
What's going on?

36:15.473 --> 36:16.974
With what?

36:17.475 --> 36:18.476
Whatever,
i don't know.

36:18.476 --> 36:21.479
What's going on?

36:21.479 --> 36:22.980
I just told you,
a chatroom.

36:23.481 --> 36:28.486
Is that it?

36:28.486 --> 36:32.490
You know i love you,
right, med?

36:32.490 --> 36:33.491
Dad...

36:33.491 --> 36:36.494
no, don't "dad" me,
c'mon.

36:36.494 --> 36:38.996
I want to know.

36:38.996 --> 36:40.998
Do you know
that i love you?

36:40.998 --> 36:43.501
Yes.

36:43.501 --> 36:48.005
I know
that you love me.

36:48.005 --> 36:51.008
'Cause your mother doesn't
think i love you enough.

36:51.509 --> 36:53.010
And you
listen to her?

36:58.516 --> 37:01.018
Everything i do...

37:01.018 --> 37:05.523
and everything i've done
and everything i will do...

37:05.523 --> 37:08.526
it's all for you
and your brother,
you know that.

37:08.526 --> 37:10.027
I think you should
go to bed.

37:10.027 --> 37:13.030
I mean, i tell people,
you're like your mother, but...

37:13.030 --> 37:18.536
you're all me,
nothing gets by you.

37:18.536 --> 37:21.539
And i know you think
i'm a hypocrite.

37:21.539 --> 37:25.042
I'm going to bed.

37:25.042 --> 37:30.047
Alright,
go ahead.

37:30.047 --> 37:35.052
Dad, why don't you
go to bed?

37:35.553 --> 37:38.055
I'm gonna
finish my drink.

37:38.556 --> 37:40.558
Okay.

37:41.058 --> 37:42.059
Goodnight.

37:42.059 --> 37:43.561
Goodnight, baby.

37:50.568 --> 37:51.569
Sometimes...

37:51.569 --> 37:53.571
we're all hypocrites.

38:05.082 --> 38:05.583
Goodnight, baby.

38:05.583 --> 38:07.585
Goodnight.

38:32.109 --> 38:33.110
So, how are
you guys doing?

38:33.611 --> 38:35.112
Anybody ready
for another sandwich?

38:35.613 --> 38:37.114
You oughta go
into business with those.

38:37.114 --> 38:38.115
Oh, stop it.

38:38.616 --> 38:41.619
Thank you,
no, mrs. Carmela.

38:41.619 --> 38:43.621
Yeah, i thought you might
be able to use this.

38:43.621 --> 38:46.624
You said that ramone
backed over your old cooler
with the truck.

38:46.624 --> 38:47.625
I lied.

38:48.125 --> 38:49.627
I smelled those
sausages cooking

38:49.627 --> 38:51.629
and i wanted you
to make me lunch.

38:51.629 --> 38:53.130
You...

38:53.130 --> 38:56.133
i guess i'm hungry
for a home- cooked meal.

38:56.133 --> 38:59.136
My wife was
a gourmet cook.

38:59.136 --> 39:01.639
Christine told me about her,
i'm so sorry.

39:02.139 --> 39:04.141
Thank you.

39:10.147 --> 39:12.149
So, listen, we were talking
about the powder room.

39:12.650 --> 39:14.151
Do you have a minute
to take a look at it now?

39:14.151 --> 39:15.152
I could kind o
f use some input.

39:15.152 --> 39:16.654
Oh, yeah, sure.

39:24.161 --> 39:26.163
The paper
that is in here now,

39:26.163 --> 39:30.167
i think it kind of
closes the room in.

39:30.167 --> 39:33.671
Yeah, i see what you mean,
it's the vertical striping.

39:33.671 --> 39:34.672
Yeah.

39:34.672 --> 39:35.673
Somebody even
talked me into

39:36.173 --> 39:37.675
papering the back
of the door here.

39:37.675 --> 39:42.680
I must've been
out of my mind.

39:42.680 --> 39:46.684
Yeah, it's a lot
for the eye to handle

39:46.684 --> 39:49.186
in such
a confined space.

39:49.186 --> 39:52.189
So, what do you think,
should i just paint maybe,

39:52.189 --> 39:54.191
or do something
sort of plainish?

39:54.191 --> 39:57.695
Just grass cloth
maybe, or...?

39:58.195 --> 39:59.697
Oh, jesus.

40:07.204 --> 40:08.205
Oh, jesus,
mary and joseph.

40:08.706 --> 40:09.707
I swear to god

40:09.707 --> 40:10.708
i never did anything
like this in my life.

40:10.708 --> 40:12.209
It's my fault,
i couldn't help it.

40:12.209 --> 40:14.712
I never felt like this before,
not in years, maybe never.

40:15.212 --> 40:16.714
Me, too, this will
never happen again.

40:16.714 --> 40:17.715
No, of course not.

40:17.715 --> 40:18.716
I apologize.

40:19.216 --> 40:20.217
You should better
get back to work.

40:20.718 --> 40:21.218
Yeah.

40:36.233 --> 40:37.234
What about
little eric?

40:37.735 --> 40:39.737
He has been
ripped from the arms

40:39.737 --> 40:43.240
of the only mother
he has ever known.

40:43.240 --> 40:46.744
You know how that
little boy loves you.

40:46.744 --> 40:51.248
We cannot
let her do this.

40:51.248 --> 40:53.751
Hey, uncle junior.

40:53.751 --> 40:57.254
I thought you guys might like
some salami and eggs.

40:57.755 --> 40:59.757
Always thinking.

40:59.757 --> 41:03.761
My mother says
to send her love.

41:04.261 --> 41:05.763
Put that stuff
in the bedroom.

41:05.763 --> 41:07.264
Leave the sneakers.

41:07.264 --> 41:09.266
Want to try them on?
They got lights on the bottom.

41:09.767 --> 41:11.268
I don't wear
that shit.

41:11.268 --> 41:13.771
I'm gonna give it to black kid
i let wash my car.

41:13.771 --> 41:17.775
Poor prick, he wears a pair
that's wrapped with duct tape.

41:17.775 --> 41:19.276
You're too good,
junior.

41:19.276 --> 41:23.781
That's your problem.

41:23.781 --> 41:25.783
Did she say
she was knocked up?

41:25.783 --> 41:26.784
Who?

41:27.284 --> 41:29.286
Fuck, i turn my head
one second

41:29.286 --> 41:30.788
and they slip one
in on you.

41:30.788 --> 41:32.790
She's a putana,
this one.

41:32.790 --> 41:37.294
Fucked an arson investigator
last week.

41:37.294 --> 41:39.296
Thank my nephew
for the stuff.

41:39.296 --> 41:40.297
Your nephew?

41:40.297 --> 41:42.800
This shit
comes from my end.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.802
I'm sorry,
i take it back.

41:44.802 --> 41:46.303
The sneakers
are from tony.

41:46.303 --> 41:48.806
Cock.

41:49.306 --> 41:53.310
You know, jun', it kills me
to sit back and watch.

41:53.310 --> 41:55.312
Forget it.

41:55.312 --> 41:56.814
No, finish what
you were gonna say.

41:56.814 --> 41:58.315
I forgot already.

41:58.315 --> 42:00.317
Then un- forget.

42:00.317 --> 42:03.320
I can't not notice
that he's fucking you.

42:03.320 --> 42:04.822
This scatino
bust out,

42:04.822 --> 42:05.823
is like
a license to steal.

42:06.323 --> 42:08.325
What's he
throwing your way?

42:08.325 --> 42:09.326
Un gatz.

42:09.326 --> 42:10.327
This garbage thing,

42:10.327 --> 42:11.829
he's already taking
your townships.

42:11.829 --> 42:13.330
Now he's fucking
with mine?

42:13.831 --> 42:14.832
What am i supposed
to do about it?

42:14.832 --> 42:16.333
I'm under indictment.

42:16.333 --> 42:18.836
Sorry, junior, i don't want to
rip open old wounds, but...

42:18.836 --> 42:20.838
i'm in no shape
for disharmony.

42:20.838 --> 42:23.340
You and i both know
he's gotta go.

42:23.340 --> 42:24.842
That's my nephew
you're talking about.

42:25.342 --> 42:27.344
How dare you
in my own home!

42:27.344 --> 42:28.345
C'mon junior,

42:28.846 --> 42:29.847
this fucking guy
was supposed to be laid out

42:29.847 --> 42:31.348
on midland avenue
a year ago.

42:31.348 --> 42:31.849
I know it.

42:32.349 --> 42:37.354
You know it.

42:37.354 --> 42:43.360
Let me tell you
who's not a good kid.

42:43.360 --> 42:45.362
That niece of mine.

42:45.863 --> 42:46.864
I left my brother's house
one night

42:47.364 --> 42:48.365
and my wallet
was light.

42:48.365 --> 42:54.872
I'm talking about
a 10- year- girl here, richie.

42:54.872 --> 42:58.375
A word to the wise,
that's all i'm saying.

43:34.912 --> 43:36.914
Now for
the first time ever

43:36.914 --> 43:39.416
you can make homemade sausage
and homemade pasta...

43:39.416 --> 43:41.418
hi, grandma.

43:41.418 --> 43:43.921
Your aunt forgot
to lock that door.

43:43.921 --> 43:47.424
I told her i don't trust
that new mailman.

43:47.925 --> 43:49.426
Guess what?

43:49.426 --> 43:51.428
I got my answers
from colleges today.

43:51.428 --> 43:54.431
Oh, yeah?
How'd you do?

43:54.431 --> 43:57.935
Accepted at berkeley,
accepted at nyu,

43:57.935 --> 43:59.436
wait list, columbia,

43:59.937 --> 44:01.438
penn,
i didn't make it,

44:01.438 --> 44:03.941
boden, i didn't make it,
b. U. Accepted.

44:03.941 --> 44:06.443
What about
that other place?

44:06.443 --> 44:08.946
Um, georgetown.

44:08.946 --> 44:12.449
Wait list.

44:12.950 --> 44:19.456
You don't
owe them anything.

44:19.957 --> 44:22.960
Thanks, grandma.

44:22.960 --> 44:25.963
Oh, lock that door,
will you?

44:25.963 --> 44:27.464
And for dessert,

44:27.464 --> 44:34.471
the kids can make
their own chocolate pasta.

44:45.482 --> 44:46.483
Hello?

44:46.483 --> 44:48.485
Carmela,
vic.

44:48.485 --> 44:50.487
Hi, how are you?

44:50.487 --> 44:53.991
I'm good,
i'm fine.

44:53.991 --> 44:56.994
I was just thinking
about you and...

44:56.994 --> 44:59.496
and what happened
this morning.

44:59.496 --> 45:00.497
And i just wanted
to say again--

45:00.998 --> 45:05.502
oh please, please,
it was just a crazy thing.

45:05.502 --> 45:08.005
But if it's a problem
for me to come back

45:08.005 --> 45:09.506
i've got another job,

45:09.506 --> 45:12.509
and yours is far enough along
that ramone can finish up.

45:12.509 --> 45:15.012
So, there's
no charge to you,

45:15.512 --> 45:17.014
except for materials.

45:17.014 --> 45:19.016
No, no, no,
i wouldn't think of it.

45:19.516 --> 45:21.518
It's just that,
you know,

45:21.518 --> 45:24.521
since jill, there hasn't been
anyone to even talk to.

45:24.521 --> 45:26.023
Oh, i know.

45:26.023 --> 45:27.024
In fact--

45:27.024 --> 45:29.026
what?

45:29.026 --> 45:30.527
Well, i was thinking
maybe tomorrow

45:31.028 --> 45:32.529
you could send ramone
to other job.

45:32.529 --> 45:35.032
That way you and i would
have a chance to talk

45:35.532 --> 45:38.535
on your lunch break
or something.

45:38.535 --> 45:40.537
That would be
so great.

45:40.537 --> 45:42.539
I could make
a lunch for us.

45:42.539 --> 45:45.042
Maybe a du poulet?

45:45.042 --> 45:48.045
Mesculin salad,

45:48.045 --> 45:49.546
nice bottle
of barollo.

45:49.546 --> 45:52.049
That sound
s incredible.

45:52.049 --> 45:53.050
Okay.

45:53.050 --> 45:54.551
Then thanks,
thanks for calling.

45:54.551 --> 45:55.552
That's terrific.

45:56.053 --> 45:56.553
Um...

45:56.553 --> 45:57.554
see you tomorrow.

45:58.055 --> 45:59.056
Yeah, i will talk to you
tomorrow then.

45:59.056 --> 46:03.060
Bye, bye.

46:03.060 --> 46:04.061
Who was that?

46:04.061 --> 46:06.563
It was nobody,
the wallpaper man.

46:39.096 --> 46:40.097
Oh, my god.

46:40.097 --> 46:43.100
What?

46:43.100 --> 46:44.601
Oh, my god,
please god, no.

46:44.601 --> 46:46.103
What the hell is it?

46:46.103 --> 46:49.606
"The victim has further been
identified as matthew bevilaqua,

46:49.606 --> 46:52.109
a soprano
family associate."

46:52.609 --> 46:57.614
Fuck,
give me that.

46:57.614 --> 46:59.616
"Officials close
to the investigation

46:59.616 --> 47:01.118
"are keeping
tight- lipped

47:01.118 --> 47:02.619
as it may involve
a high ranking mafia member."

47:02.619 --> 47:03.620
Oh, my god.

47:04.121 --> 47:05.122
Where's that
detective's number?

47:05.122 --> 47:06.123
On the fridge.

47:06.123 --> 47:09.626
Those lying
cocksuckers.

47:09.626 --> 47:10.627
Where on
the fridge?

47:11.128 --> 47:12.129
On the fridge,
on the fridge!

47:12.129 --> 47:13.130
Where on
the fucking fridge?

47:13.130 --> 47:14.131
I knew it,
i knew it!

47:14.131 --> 47:19.636
But you had to be
a big man!

47:19.636 --> 47:24.641
Jesus christ, david,
where the hell have you been?

47:24.641 --> 47:27.144
Thanks for coming,
thanks for coming.

47:27.144 --> 47:28.645
I'm glad
you called me.

47:28.645 --> 47:31.148
My sister's been
worried sick about you.

47:31.148 --> 47:32.149
I know.

47:32.149 --> 47:35.652
I'm sorry,
i should've called her.

47:35.652 --> 47:38.655
How about i say i'm sorry
to the whole fucking world?

47:38.655 --> 47:41.158
Rent the fuji blimp
or something?

47:41.158 --> 47:43.160
Christine knows you're
gambling again, she told me.

47:43.160 --> 47:45.662
Not gambling anymore,
i'm broke.

47:45.662 --> 47:48.165
Jesus christ.

47:48.165 --> 47:50.667
I screwed up, vic.

47:50.667 --> 47:52.669
I screwed up really bad
this time.

47:52.669 --> 47:54.671
Look, it's gonna be okay,
it's gonna be alright.

47:54.671 --> 47:56.673
You're gonna go back
to gamblers anonymous,

47:56.673 --> 47:58.175
we'll figure out
a payment plan

47:58.175 --> 47:58.675
and we'll get you
back on your feet.

47:59.176 --> 48:00.177
Gamblers anonymous.

48:00.677 --> 48:02.179
You think it's a big joke,
but you're going back there.

48:02.179 --> 48:03.680
Is that right?

48:03.680 --> 48:06.183
Where the fuck were you when
i dropped out in first place?

48:06.183 --> 48:08.685
I was just twisting
in the fucking wind out there.

48:08.685 --> 48:09.186
What?!

48:09.186 --> 48:10.187
Both of you!

48:10.187 --> 48:11.688
With your fucking
broom up your asses.

48:11.688 --> 48:13.690
You didn't
give a fuck.

48:13.690 --> 48:15.692
You just fucking
looked the other way!

48:15.692 --> 48:17.194
Now it's
our fault now?

48:17.194 --> 48:18.695
Don't you ever talk
about christine like that, ever.

48:19.196 --> 48:22.199
Fuck her!
Fuck you!

48:22.199 --> 48:24.201
How much
did you lose?

48:24.201 --> 48:26.203
How much?

48:26.203 --> 48:28.205
How much did you
fucking lose?

48:28.205 --> 48:29.706
Everything.

48:29.706 --> 48:30.707
What do you mean
everything?

48:31.208 --> 48:32.209
Everything, everything!

48:32.209 --> 48:34.211
For chrissakes, vic,
everything,

48:34.211 --> 48:37.214
the savings,
the business, everything.

48:43.220 --> 48:45.722
You disgust me.

48:45.722 --> 48:47.224
I have to go
chapter 11.

48:47.724 --> 48:49.726
And then the liquidators
will come in

48:49.726 --> 48:50.727
and they'll
pick through the bones.

48:50.727 --> 48:51.728
This is it, david.

48:52.229 --> 48:55.232
I fucking had it,
this is it.

48:55.232 --> 48:57.234
As soon as eric
goes off to college,

48:57.234 --> 48:59.236
by the way, he got
into georgetown today,

48:59.236 --> 49:00.237
you probably didn't
know about that.

49:00.237 --> 49:01.738
But as soon as that kid's
out of the house,

49:02.239 --> 49:03.240
you're packing your bags

49:03.240 --> 49:09.246
and you're keeping the fuck
away from my sister.

49:09.246 --> 49:13.250
David, don't tell me
you blew eric's college fund.

49:19.756 --> 49:22.259
Jesus christ.

49:22.259 --> 49:25.262
Jesus.

49:25.262 --> 49:26.763
You fucking asshole.

49:27.264 --> 49:30.767
How could
you do that?

49:30.767 --> 49:33.770
Jesus.

49:34.271 --> 49:35.272
Well...

49:35.272 --> 49:37.774
i'm paying for
that kid's education.

49:37.774 --> 49:38.775
Thank you.

49:38.775 --> 49:40.777
Thank you.

49:40.777 --> 49:46.283
You're
a great man, vic.

49:46.283 --> 49:50.787
Wait a minute.

49:50.787 --> 49:53.290
How could you gamble
the business away?

49:53.290 --> 49:54.791
It's in
my sister's name,
isn't it?

49:54.791 --> 49:56.293
I didn't gamble it
away exactly.

49:56.293 --> 49:59.296
What happened?

49:59.296 --> 50:01.298
I got involved
with some bad people.

50:01.298 --> 50:04.801
And i got in debt
to'em, and...

50:04.801 --> 50:07.804
fucking tony soprano,
alright?

50:07.804 --> 50:11.308
Yeah,
tony fucking soprano.

50:11.308 --> 50:12.809
It's a bust out.

50:12.809 --> 50:14.811
You get in debt to'em
where you can't pay'em,

50:14.811 --> 50:16.313
they become
your partners

50:16.813 --> 50:20.317
and then they fucking
eat through everything
like fucking termites.

50:20.317 --> 50:22.319
What about
the cops?

50:22.319 --> 50:24.821
They're animals, vic.

50:24.821 --> 50:27.824
They started a fire
in my dumpster.

50:27.824 --> 50:30.327
These two guys came
to see me one night.

50:30.827 --> 50:33.830
You got no idea
what dead eyes means
until you face these people,

50:33.830 --> 50:37.334
in your fucking bathrobe
and flip- flops.

50:43.340 --> 50:46.343
France 1944...

50:46.343 --> 50:50.847
general george patton lead
s his third army into battle.

50:50.847 --> 50:52.349
He knows that
the controversies

50:52.349 --> 50:55.852
that have swirled about him
have tarnished his reputation.

50:56.353 --> 50:58.355
He desperately wants
to vindicate himself

50:58.855 --> 51:00.357
in the only way
he knows how...

51:04.361 --> 51:05.362
hello.

51:05.362 --> 51:06.863
It's over, skip.

51:06.863 --> 51:07.864
What do you mean?

51:08.365 --> 51:10.367
You know that other party
who said he saw something

51:10.367 --> 51:11.868
that we know
didn't happen?

51:11.868 --> 51:14.371
Yeah.

51:14.371 --> 51:16.373
He realizes now
he didn't see

51:16.373 --> 51:18.375
what we know
didn't happen.

51:24.881 --> 51:26.883
Yeah.

51:26.883 --> 51:29.386
Sleep well,
my friend.

51:29.386 --> 51:31.888
...major strategy
is the attack.

51:32.389 --> 51:33.890
"The more germans we kill,

51:33.890 --> 51:37.394
the fewer of our own men
will be killed", he said.

51:37.394 --> 51:39.396
Patton's hatred for the enemy

51:39.396 --> 51:42.399
is matched only by his
fierce concern for his men.

52:13.430 --> 52:14.431
You seem relieved.

52:14.931 --> 52:15.932
Yeah.

52:16.433 --> 52:19.936
Yeah.

52:19.936 --> 52:22.439
So this person,
the witness,

52:22.439 --> 52:25.442
simply changed
his or her mind?

52:25.442 --> 52:26.943
I don't know
what happened.

52:26.943 --> 52:28.945
You don't?

52:28.945 --> 52:35.952
What's that
supposed to mean?

52:35.952 --> 52:37.454
You know,
when i was in italy

52:37.454 --> 52:41.458
i met somebody
that reminded me of you.

52:41.958 --> 52:42.959
A woman.

52:42.959 --> 52:45.462
And it's not
what you think.

52:45.462 --> 52:46.963
Like me
in what way?

52:46.963 --> 52:49.466
Smart.

52:49.966 --> 52:51.468
You know what
she said to me?

52:51.468 --> 52:52.469
What did she say?

52:52.969 --> 52:54.471
She told me that
i'm my own worst enemy.

52:54.471 --> 52:56.973
That's kind of a cliche,
isn't it?

52:56.973 --> 52:57.974
You had
to be there.

52:58.475 --> 53:03.480
She's one of them
witchy broads,
you know?

53:03.480 --> 53:04.981
Not like
a psychic, but...

53:05.482 --> 53:07.484
i didn't mean
to sound disparaging.

53:07.484 --> 53:12.489
That's some
ancient culture over there.

53:12.489 --> 53:15.992
They believe
all this weird shit...

53:15.992 --> 53:16.993
like sybils.

53:17.494 --> 53:18.495
Sybils?

53:18.495 --> 53:21.998
Like i said,
you had to be there.

53:21.998 --> 53:24.000
Okay, so,
i wanted to fuck her.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.503
But she was right,
what she said, right?

53:26.503 --> 53:27.504
I mean...

53:27.504 --> 53:29.506
i bring
all this on myself.

53:29.506 --> 53:32.509
I mean, that's what
you keep telling me.

53:32.509 --> 53:39.015
Yes, i suppose it is
at root.

53:39.015 --> 53:40.517
The question is...

53:40.517 --> 53:42.018
how do you stop?

53:48.024 --> 53:49.025
You know what?

53:49.025 --> 53:50.026
What?

53:50.026 --> 53:52.529
I dodged
a very big bullet.

53:52.529 --> 53:56.032
And i'm feeling pretty
fucking good about it.

53:56.032 --> 54:01.037
So, i don't need anymore
psychiatry today.

54:13.049 --> 54:15.051
Hey, license
and registration pal.

54:15.051 --> 54:17.053
Hey, tony,
what are you doing here?

54:23.059 --> 54:25.061
I got something
for you.

54:25.061 --> 54:26.062
What is that?

54:26.062 --> 54:29.065
50 grand.

54:29.065 --> 54:31.067
Get the fuck out of here
with that.

54:31.568 --> 54:32.569
Why?

54:32.569 --> 54:33.570
Because
i'm a paraplegic?

54:33.570 --> 54:35.572
My idea was
for you to donate it

54:35.572 --> 54:38.074
to the spinal cord
injury foundation.

54:38.074 --> 54:41.578
I'm gonna
walk again, tony.

54:41.578 --> 54:43.580
I know you are, beans.

54:43.580 --> 54:47.083
But in the meantime you donate,
you get your picture up,

54:47.083 --> 54:48.585
inspire people
a little bit.

54:48.585 --> 54:51.087
Oh what, you mean be
like a fucking poster boy?

54:51.087 --> 54:52.589
Is that
what you mean?

54:52.589 --> 54:53.590
Just take the money,

54:54.090 --> 54:56.593
you can whack it u
p with the foundation.

54:56.593 --> 55:01.097
Fuck you, tony.

55:01.097 --> 55:04.100
Take the money,
beans.

55:04.100 --> 55:06.603
You got to take it.

55:06.603 --> 55:08.104
Beansie...

55:14.110 --> 55:15.111
thank you.

55:15.612 --> 55:18.114
Thank you.

55:18.114 --> 55:20.116
Thank you, beans.

55:39.135 --> 55:42.138
Lilliana
can you get that?

56:06.663 --> 56:07.664
Ramone.

56:07.664 --> 56:11.668
Morning, mrs.

56:11.668 --> 56:12.669
Mr. Musta
no es come.

56:13.169 --> 56:14.170
Oh.

56:14.671 --> 56:16.172
Oh, is he okay?

56:16.172 --> 56:18.675
Yeah, but he has
to go to the other job.

56:18.675 --> 56:19.676
Oh.

56:19.676 --> 56:21.177
Okay.

57:02.218 --> 57:03.219
Want to steer?

57:03.219 --> 57:04.220
Yeah.

57:04.220 --> 57:05.221
No you don't.

57:05.221 --> 57:07.223
I do.

57:07.724 --> 57:09.726
I'd let you but
if the harbor master sees us,

57:09.726 --> 57:11.227
we get in
a lot of trouble.

57:11.227 --> 57:14.731
Nobody's gonna see.

57:15.231 --> 57:16.733
I don't know.

57:16.733 --> 57:18.234
C'mon.

57:18.234 --> 57:19.736
Go ahead.

57:19.736 --> 57:22.739
Now listen, driving a boat's
not like driving a car,

57:22.739 --> 57:24.240
'cause you got
no breaks to slam on,

57:24.240 --> 57:25.742
and you can't
make quick turns.

57:25.742 --> 57:28.745
So you got to anticipate
your turns a lot sooner.

57:28.745 --> 57:31.247
This is so cool.

57:31.247 --> 57:33.750
620 horsepower.

57:48.264 --> 57:49.265
Look out!

57:49.265 --> 57:51.267
Stop!

57:51.267 --> 57:57.273
Look out!
