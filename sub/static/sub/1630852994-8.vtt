00:13.930 --> 00:15.765
I'm Jimmy DiResta, and I'm a maker.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.601
That's a hip way of saying
I make things… like this.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.811
Pretty cool, right?

00:20.520 --> 00:21.354
Walk with me.

00:21.855 --> 00:24.858
For years, I made my name
as a toy designer in New York City.

00:24.941 --> 00:28.570
Then I realized I don't like the city,
I don't like designing toys,

00:28.653 --> 00:31.448
and to be honest with you,
I don't really like kids.

00:31.531 --> 00:33.074
It's not like I hate them or anything.

00:33.158 --> 00:35.744
It's just it's,
"Check out my little Timmy."

00:35.827 --> 00:36.745
I don't care.

00:37.245 --> 00:38.246
Look at my birds.

00:40.081 --> 00:41.833
So anyway, I quit my job,

00:41.916 --> 00:45.503
I left the city,
and I moved upstate to here, my farm.

00:45.587 --> 00:48.089
I got land, I got animals,

00:48.590 --> 00:50.633
and best of all, I have this.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.136
The ultimate maker workshop!

00:53.720 --> 00:58.141
Inside, I have every kind of tool
and machine imaginable to make things.

00:59.309 --> 01:01.019
Pretty impressive stuff, huh?

01:02.187 --> 01:05.356
Really? You're labeling the table
like that's some sort of impress--

01:05.440 --> 01:07.067
"Bag"? We can just--

01:07.150 --> 01:09.569
Okay. Graphics guy trying to be funny.

01:09.652 --> 01:12.030
Can we please get on with it? Anyway…

01:12.113 --> 01:15.158
So I got a call to be on a TV show
'cause I'm a maker celebrity or whatever.

01:15.241 --> 01:17.368
I said, "Sure. Cool." Why not, right?

01:17.452 --> 01:18.536
So I agreed.

01:19.287 --> 01:21.206
Then I found out who I'd be working for.

01:21.289 --> 01:22.207
<i>Jimmy!</i>

01:22.290 --> 01:23.625
<i>-Hi.</i>
<i>-Hi!</i>

01:23.708 --> 01:24.626
<i>Jimmy!</i>

01:24.709 --> 01:25.543
<i>Hey, Jimmy!</i>

01:25.627 --> 01:26.753
What do you want?

01:26.836 --> 01:28.630
<i>Okay, Mr. Grouch!</i>

01:29.839 --> 01:34.302
Thirty years of expert build experience,
and I'm taking orders from half-pints.

01:34.385 --> 01:37.806
And because misery loves company,
I brought my buddies in on it with me.

01:37.889 --> 01:38.723
Say hi, guys.

01:38.807 --> 01:39.641
-Howdy!
-Hello!

01:39.724 --> 01:42.727
That's Jackman.
He's an engineer, and he plans everything.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.437
It's really annoying, but he's good at it.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.397
That's Derek, my best friend.

01:46.981 --> 01:49.692
Big guy and even bigger softie.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.653
This is Graz.

01:51.736 --> 01:53.696
Good maker, bad jokes.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.031
And Canadian Pat.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.618
Well, your guess is as good as mine.

01:58.701 --> 01:59.702
Let's have fun.

02:03.873 --> 02:05.583
Together, we'll take pitches on this.

02:05.667 --> 02:08.419
Listen to whatever
their dumb little brains can come up with.

02:08.503 --> 02:10.672
<i>The Pig Tripper. It trips the pig.</i>

02:10.755 --> 02:13.424
-Wow.
So a catapult that throws cat poop?

02:13.508 --> 02:15.301
<i>-Yes.</i>

02:15.385 --> 02:18.471
If it's interesting or doable,
I'll build it! If not--

02:18.555 --> 02:19.514
Next!

02:19.597 --> 02:20.765
-Next!
<i>-No way.</i>

02:20.849 --> 02:22.392
-Next!
<i>-Shut up!</i>

02:22.475 --> 02:24.185
-Some builds will be good.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.104
Dino Taco Toilet.

02:26.187 --> 02:27.689
Are you not entertained?

02:27.772 --> 02:29.357
Some builds will be bad.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.693
Graz, I told you
the scissors were gonna be too heavy!

02:31.776 --> 02:32.819
Make a bigger handle!

02:32.902 --> 02:35.029
But all of them
will be absolutely pointless.

02:35.113 --> 02:37.157
-Yeah!
<i>-That is disgusting.</i>

02:38.408 --> 02:40.076
Whoa!

02:40.660 --> 02:43.872
<i>-I want the unicorn to fart!</i>
-I can't believe I'm doing this.

02:43.955 --> 02:45.373
-Go, Graz!

02:46.082 --> 02:49.127
Why are we doing this?
Because we make things. That's what we do.

02:49.210 --> 02:52.172
-Thought we weren't supposed to have fun!
-I'm not having fun!

02:52.255 --> 02:54.966
We're gonna show these kids,
if they can dream it up…

02:55.049 --> 02:58.052
<i>I want it to be a guitar boat that floats.</i>

02:58.136 --> 02:59.262
You're onto something there.

02:59.345 --> 03:00.930
…it can be built.

03:01.931 --> 03:03.266
<i>Oh!</i>

03:03.349 --> 03:04.350
<i>That is so cool!</i>

03:04.976 --> 03:07.020
Hey, it might even
inspire themto build

03:07.103 --> 03:09.189
outside their little <i>Minecraft</i> -y world,
or whatever.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.065
-Do I wanna do it?

03:11.149 --> 03:12.650
Dumbest thing we've ever made.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.820
Not really.
But this isn't about me, is it?

03:15.904 --> 03:18.031
-So here we are.
<i>-You better get to work!</i>

03:18.114 --> 03:20.158
Funny how their dreams are my nightmare.

03:21.367 --> 03:23.369
Come on, Jimmy. Have some fun.

03:23.453 --> 03:24.329
Whatever.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.677
-Can I have some more nuts?

03:41.262 --> 03:42.096
Oh.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.766
You just gave me all raisins!

03:45.767 --> 03:48.102
Pat, what are raisins called in Canada?

03:48.186 --> 03:49.270
Dried raisin.

03:49.771 --> 03:52.899
They call grapes raisins,
and they call these dried raisins.

03:52.982 --> 03:54.817
This is a glitch in the Matrix right now.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.153
This doesn't make sense.
Would you like a raisin?

03:57.237 --> 03:58.071
Yeah. Please.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.866
-Oh. Little higher.
-Almost went into his pocket.

04:01.950 --> 04:03.952
-I don't wanna waste my nuts.
-Oh!

04:04.452 --> 04:05.411
So close, Graz.

04:06.162 --> 04:07.163
Oh.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.373
It went in and out.

04:08.456 --> 04:09.666
Go like this, first.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.042
Wait. No.

04:11.125 --> 04:12.168
Pat.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.087
-You got it!
-Oh!

04:14.170 --> 04:16.673
-What just happened there?

04:19.217 --> 04:20.176
-Ready?
-Yeah.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.512
We have kids' pitches.
Let's get this over with.

04:22.595 --> 04:23.846
All right.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.848
I'm gonna sit on Pat's lap.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.475
First kid up. Let's go.

04:27.558 --> 04:28.393
<i>Hi!</i>

04:28.476 --> 04:29.519
<i>-Hi!</i>
-Oh boy.

04:29.602 --> 04:30.687
What are your names?

04:30.770 --> 04:33.690
<i>My name is Locke, and I'm nine.</i>

04:33.773 --> 04:36.442
<i>Lianne, and I am six.</i>

04:36.526 --> 04:38.278
<i>I'm Addy, and this is Wilson.</i>

04:38.361 --> 04:39.529
<i>Nevaeh.</i>

04:39.612 --> 04:42.240
Nevaeh, is this a YouTube makeup tutorial?

04:42.323 --> 04:44.534
<i>I totally have too much ChapStick on!</i>

04:44.617 --> 04:45.451
You and Graz.

04:45.535 --> 04:46.661
What? No.

04:46.744 --> 04:48.121
-Yeah.
No!

04:48.204 --> 04:49.956
Where in the world are you guys?

04:50.039 --> 04:51.624
<i>We're in California.</i>

04:51.708 --> 04:53.418
What highway do you take to school?

04:53.501 --> 04:55.003
<i>We take the 10 freeway.</i>

04:55.086 --> 04:57.630
Do you take the 10 to the 405 to the 5?

04:57.714 --> 04:59.007
<i>No. We do not.</i>

04:59.090 --> 05:01.175
-Leave them alone. They're nice kids.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.885
You guys have some ideas for me?

05:02.969 --> 05:06.264
<i>An animal avenger ATV course.</i>

05:06.347 --> 05:08.975
<i>And it's with a volcano in the middle</i>

05:09.058 --> 05:13.980
<i>that shoots out slime lava</i>
<i>with a river with crocodiles.</i>

05:14.063 --> 05:16.816
-Might as well throw bees in.
-Yeah. How about killer bees?

05:16.899 --> 05:18.568
<i>-No. No.</i>
<i>-No.</i>

05:18.651 --> 05:21.446
-No. That would be ridiculous.

05:21.529 --> 05:23.656
<i>It's called Cupquake Kitchen.</i>

05:23.740 --> 05:24.991
Cupquake Kitchen.

05:25.074 --> 05:26.993
-I like the name.
-It's a good brand name.

05:27.076 --> 05:29.579
<i>Yeah. It's a trampoline dance party.</i>

05:29.662 --> 05:31.205
Trampoline dance party?

05:31.289 --> 05:33.499
<i>We actually have a model.</i>

05:33.583 --> 05:34.709
A model?

05:34.792 --> 05:36.669
You put eight marshmallows down,

05:36.753 --> 05:38.671
and you melted them into puffcakes.

05:38.755 --> 05:39.797
Seven marshmallows.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.050
-<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>-More like seven.</i>

05:44.719 --> 05:48.056
<i>It's called Cupquake Kitchen</i>
<i>because at random times</i>

05:48.139 --> 05:51.809
<i>it does a random earthquake sound,</i>
<i>and you have to dance for ten seconds.</i>

05:51.893 --> 05:54.645
You realize dancing is not in my contract.

05:57.065 --> 05:58.191
No.

05:58.274 --> 05:59.525
Not gonna watch.

05:59.609 --> 06:03.821
-Locke, what music do you like?
<i>-My favorite music is country.</i>

06:03.905 --> 06:05.990
Yeah. Next. Get them out. Get them out.

06:06.074 --> 06:09.535
So you want me to create
a hurricane, a volcano, a waterfall.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.496
What actually do you want me to make?

06:11.579 --> 06:14.040
You just asked me to create
like 13 miracles.

06:14.123 --> 06:17.335
<i>You're just jealous</i>
<i>'cause our ideas are better than yours.</i>

06:18.252 --> 06:20.713
I think I'm on TV,
and you're on a Zoom call.

06:21.881 --> 06:24.217
-You guys know what this means?
-He's warming it up.

06:24.300 --> 06:26.135
-You like country music?
-<i> Yeah.</i>

06:26.219 --> 06:29.847
Interesting. You could write a sad song
about how you were swiped off a TV show.

06:31.474 --> 06:32.600
-Heartless.
-Next.

06:32.683 --> 06:35.686
Now on one, two, three
we go like this. One, two, three.

06:35.770 --> 06:36.604
<i>No!</i>

06:38.940 --> 06:41.734
-It's never not funny.
-We're gonna sleep on the idea.

06:41.818 --> 06:44.529
Like they say in Hollywood,
"Don't call us, we'll call you."

06:44.612 --> 06:45.822
<i>Thanks, Jimmy Fallon!</i>

06:45.905 --> 06:47.865
-Bye!

06:50.159 --> 06:51.953
Is it hot in here, or is it me?

06:52.036 --> 06:53.538
-These ideas suck.
-Definitely not you.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.624
Oh! What's up, buddy? What's your name?

06:56.707 --> 06:59.043
<i>Hi. My name is Jayden Han.</i>

06:59.127 --> 07:00.920
Where are you? What city are you in?

07:01.003 --> 07:02.797
<i>Uh, Garden Grove, California.</i>

07:02.880 --> 07:04.048
Okay. How old are you?

07:04.132 --> 07:06.217
<i>I am almost 12 years old.</i>

07:06.300 --> 07:08.719
-I thought you were gonna say 32.

07:08.803 --> 07:10.513
What do you wanna be when you grow up?

07:10.596 --> 07:12.432
<i>I would love to be an actor</i>
<i>when I grow up.</i>

07:12.515 --> 07:13.433
Really?

07:13.516 --> 07:15.268
Can you do Christopher Walken?

07:16.394 --> 07:18.104
No. I don't think so.

07:18.187 --> 07:21.149
Come on. You gotta do Christopher Walken.

07:22.650 --> 07:25.278
How about DeNiro? Can you do DeNiro?

07:25.778 --> 07:28.364
<i>-Uh…</i>
-You gotta do just a little bit.

07:28.448 --> 07:31.617
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>who anybody you guys talk about is.</i>

07:31.701 --> 07:34.579
-I never get the references either.
-<i>All right. All right.</i>

07:34.662 --> 07:36.205
Do you have an idea for us?

07:36.289 --> 07:39.333
<i>-Ah, yes. I'm in love with music.</i>
-Okay.

07:39.417 --> 07:42.253
<i>And of my favorite instruments</i>
<i>is the guitar.</i>

07:42.336 --> 07:47.925
<i>So I would love for you</i>
<i>to make me a guitar.</i>

07:48.009 --> 07:50.178
-You want me to make you a guitar?
-Let's do it.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.304
<i>Yes.</i>
-That's it?

07:51.387 --> 07:54.390
Say yeah before he complicates it.
-<i>A gigantic guitar.</i>

07:54.474 --> 07:58.352
<i>No. I want it as big as a boat.</i>

07:58.436 --> 08:03.441
<i>I want it to be a guitar-boat</i>
<i>that floats on water!</i>

08:04.275 --> 08:06.194
-Just give up.

08:06.277 --> 08:07.695
So wait… So you started,

08:07.778 --> 08:10.323
"I want a guitar."
Then, "I want a big guitar."

08:10.406 --> 08:12.825
"I want it big as a boat."
"I want it to be a boat."

08:12.909 --> 08:14.368
Tell me how you see the boat.

08:14.452 --> 08:16.787
Where does somebody sit?
What happens? How does it work?

08:16.871 --> 08:20.917
<i>Well, lucky for you,</i>
<i>I have a design up my sleeve.</i>

08:21.501 --> 08:23.044
Oh boy.

08:23.127 --> 08:25.880
<i>-It's a beauty. Isn't it?</i>
-More planning than you've done, Jimmy.

08:25.963 --> 08:30.343
<i>These fret things would be the seats,</i>
<i>and they would be humongous.</i>

08:30.426 --> 08:33.095
So if those are the seats,
that thing is 85 feet long.

08:33.179 --> 08:36.182
-We're all gonna sit on this thing.
-I'm not building you a cruise ship.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.517
<i>Fair enough.</i>

08:37.600 --> 08:39.977
-I like the idea of a big guitar.
-Me too.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.438
-I like the idea of a big guitar boat.
-How big?

08:42.522 --> 08:45.900
My canoe is on the wall.
I mean, that's 17 feet long.

08:45.983 --> 08:49.028
What if we made a guitar boat
that was big enough for two guys?

08:49.111 --> 08:51.030
One Pat Lap and one Graz?

08:51.113 --> 08:53.074
It'll fit one and a half people.

08:53.157 --> 08:55.117
Low-hanging fruit,
I wish I could reach it.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.912
So, what if we used the paddles,

08:57.995 --> 09:00.081
and it was big guitar picks at the end?

09:00.164 --> 09:02.708
<i>Oh, a big… Oh yeah. That's a good idea.</i>

09:02.792 --> 09:05.127
You like that idea?
What is the yellow thing?

09:05.211 --> 09:09.382
<i>Oh, this is just the design.</i>
<i>I want it to be like a bolt.</i>

09:09.465 --> 09:11.676
<i>Yeah. It just looks really cool.</i>

09:11.759 --> 09:14.262
You want it to be different
than the other guitar boats?

09:14.345 --> 09:16.222
<i>You're dang right I do!</i>

09:18.140 --> 09:19.392
I, I, I like this idea.

09:19.475 --> 09:22.061
You guys like this idea
to make a big, giant guitar boat?

09:22.144 --> 09:25.356
-It won't look like that drawing.
-It could be really fun.

09:25.439 --> 09:27.984
-Jayden, we're gonna make your guitar.
<i>-Yes! Yes!</i>

09:28.693 --> 09:29.735
See you.

09:31.612 --> 09:33.781
Strumbody's gonna be happy.

09:33.864 --> 09:34.782
What?

09:34.865 --> 09:37.535
Strumbody's gonna be really happy
if we make it.

09:38.953 --> 09:41.122
Tune in later in the show
when we build this guitar.

09:41.205 --> 09:43.165
-Strum? Oh, that's good.
-Tune.

09:43.791 --> 09:46.168
Jimmy, you really changed
your tune on that one.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.920
Oh, that's a good one.

09:48.004 --> 09:49.880
Horrible. Let's get to work.

09:58.472 --> 10:00.266
So this is a boat,

10:01.017 --> 10:04.228
and this is a guitar.

10:04.312 --> 10:05.938
We're gonna combine them.

10:06.022 --> 10:09.859
I see the body of the guitar being made
with plywood and some bendy plywood.

10:09.942 --> 10:13.154
I'm seeing about eight feet,
nine feet from here to here.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.822
Eight feet for a sheet of plywood.

10:14.905 --> 10:16.824
Eight feet for a sheet of plywood.
You got it.

10:16.907 --> 10:18.367
Keep the numbers easy.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.578
This will be the front of the boat.
If somebody's here…

10:20.661 --> 10:21.495
Yeah.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.706
We'll do big cut-outs
so people can hang out.

10:23.789 --> 10:24.624
Yeah.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.460
Making a big guitar is one thing,
but we have to make it float.

10:27.543 --> 10:29.170
So we gotta make it buoyant.

10:29.253 --> 10:30.421
Ooh.

10:30.504 --> 10:31.922
That's a fun word. Buoyant.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.300
-"Boint"? "Boint."
-"Boint"?

10:34.383 --> 10:35.217
Buoyant.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.637
-Buoyant. That's what I said.
-Buoyant?

10:37.720 --> 10:39.972
Is that before an adult ant?
It's a "boy ant"?

10:40.056 --> 10:41.724
-Ha!

10:42.558 --> 10:43.976
You'll make a good dad.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.187
We're also gonna
have to make it waterproof

10:46.270 --> 10:48.272
in the way that we're gonna
have to put epoxy.

10:48.356 --> 10:52.109
Maybe we'll get fancy, and we'll do
some veneer, like some Walnut veneer.

10:52.193 --> 10:55.613
Jackman, we're gonna rely on your carving
capabilities and making the whole neck.

10:55.696 --> 10:56.989
All right, I can do that.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.033
Let's not forget
the kid wanted a lightning bolt.

10:59.116 --> 11:01.077
So we gotta do some sorta
wood burning on the top.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.788
What's that? You put
the two electrodes on the sides,

11:03.871 --> 11:05.665
and then a lightning bolt goes…

11:05.748 --> 11:07.083
-Lichtenberg?
-We do that.

11:07.166 --> 11:10.753
We can make lightning bolts burn in
on the top. It'll look really cool.

11:10.836 --> 11:14.090
We talked a little bit about making
the paddles look like guitar chips.

11:14.173 --> 11:15.424
-Picks.
-Picks.

11:15.508 --> 11:18.010
-You never say guitar chip?
-A guitar chip?

11:18.094 --> 11:19.303
-Yeah.
-No.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.806
I've been saying guitar chip
my whole life.

11:21.889 --> 11:23.516
He plays guitar
with a Dorito.

11:23.599 --> 11:25.726
Your mother gave you some bad information.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.436
Derek and I will take care of the body.

11:27.520 --> 11:30.648
Jackman, you work on the neck
with Graz's help.

11:30.731 --> 11:33.150
-Pat, you work on the paddle chips.
-Yeah.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.944
We'll get this thing coming together.

11:35.027 --> 11:38.197
-I'll do the lightning bolts too.
-Work on the bolts, but be careful.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.782
-It's dangerous.
-Perfect.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.159
Let's get materials. Let's get started.

11:42.243 --> 11:46.122
All right. Well, if I don't get
electrocuted, at least I'll drown.

11:51.001 --> 11:53.379
<i>I have a design up my sleeve.</i>

11:53.462 --> 11:55.256
<i>That floats on water!</i>

12:03.097 --> 12:06.767
<i>We gotta make it buoyant</i>
<i>We gotta make it float.</i>

12:07.518 --> 12:08.853
<i>Guitar boat.</i>

12:08.936 --> 12:10.396
<i>Guitar boat.</i>

12:23.242 --> 12:24.910
The first thing you and I have to do

12:24.994 --> 12:27.788
is figure out
what the body is gonna be shaped like.

12:28.456 --> 12:29.540
Arrgh!

12:29.623 --> 12:32.334
The challenge with this build
is that we have to build a guitar

12:32.418 --> 12:35.880
that's big enough to hold two people
but light enough to float.

12:35.963 --> 12:38.924
Okay, what we're gonna do
is use this sheet of plywood

12:39.008 --> 12:40.634
to make our first quadrant.

12:40.718 --> 12:43.721
The guitar body is gonna be made
in two quadrants on the top

12:43.804 --> 12:44.930
and two on the bottom.

12:45.014 --> 12:49.602
So we need four pieces to make up
the full top and back of the guitar.

12:49.685 --> 12:52.855
And once we establish
the shape of this one quarter,

12:52.938 --> 12:54.565
we'll use it to make the other three.

12:54.648 --> 12:55.483
All right.

12:55.566 --> 12:57.735
We're gonna use this ruler
to create some fair curves.

12:57.818 --> 13:02.198
A guitar body has a pretty simple shape,
but we wanna make sure we get it right.

13:02.281 --> 13:03.324
Go slow.

13:03.407 --> 13:07.995
Because any mistake on this first piece
is gonna get copied to the other pieces.

13:08.078 --> 13:09.038
I'm a good marker.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.540
Unlike our other builds,
we're not covering this guitar

13:11.624 --> 13:13.209
with a bunch of foam and paint.

13:13.292 --> 13:15.127
-That's it. There you go.
-Nice.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.546
We wanna keep it natural
so it looks real.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.881
Let's get cutting.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.177
We're scoring this cut
with a razor blade…

13:23.260 --> 13:24.595
One down, three to go.

13:24.678 --> 13:26.764
…and smoothing it out with a router,

13:27.306 --> 13:30.559
to give us a nice, clean edge
as this build unfolds.

13:30.643 --> 13:34.271
This looks like we're just building
a sign for the Hard Rock Cafe.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.981
That's what I was thinking.

13:36.065 --> 13:39.193
Now that we've got
all four body pieces assembled…

13:40.402 --> 13:42.154
I've got some apple boxes.

13:42.238 --> 13:46.742
…we'll use apple boxes to hold
them as we install the vertical supports.

13:51.622 --> 13:55.334
Not only does this structure
give our boatman a place to sit,

13:55.417 --> 13:58.170
it also creates
a nice, hollow air-filled interior

13:58.254 --> 13:59.964
to keep the boat light and floaty.

14:00.965 --> 14:03.676
-Done!
-This one here's already a winner.

14:09.348 --> 14:10.808
All right. So what are we doing here?

14:10.891 --> 14:12.768
We're working on the neck of the guitar.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.895
We got butcher block here to work with.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.856
Bunch of different species,
some oak and maple.

14:16.939 --> 14:18.440
Very heavy butcher block.

14:18.524 --> 14:21.068
We need weight. Buoyancy fun fact.

14:22.736 --> 14:24.905
<i>Buoyancy fun fact.</i>

14:25.531 --> 14:27.616
-No! Hold off on the buoyancy fun fact.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.743
<i>Oops, I'll come back later.</i>

14:32.329 --> 14:35.374
What we'll do is rip these down
into strips and then glue them together,

14:35.457 --> 14:37.293
and that big lamination
will become the neck.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.336
So, the size that they're doing,

14:39.420 --> 14:43.299
the neck should probably
be roughly about a foot wide?

14:43.382 --> 14:46.969
About a foot wide. Then we'll figure
out the thickness and length from there.

14:47.595 --> 14:50.639
We're stacking multiple layers
of butcher block countertops together

14:50.723 --> 14:53.350
to give us the basic structure
of our guitar neck,

14:53.434 --> 14:56.478
and then we'll carve everything down
to give it the proper shape.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.480
Cool. Let's get ripping.

15:00.900 --> 15:01.901
It's so heavy.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.653
Very heavy butcher block.

15:05.571 --> 15:06.488
That's heavy.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.741
-You got it?
-That's so heavy.

15:09.658 --> 15:11.327
I can do it with one arm.

15:12.578 --> 15:13.412
Jimmy!

15:13.996 --> 15:15.497
What is the concern?

15:15.581 --> 15:17.541
This is like a 1,000 pounds.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.501
Graz is concerned it's not gonna float.

15:19.585 --> 15:20.961
We're building a guitar submarine.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.881
As long as it's waterproof,
it'll hold over 5,000 pounds.

15:24.423 --> 15:25.507
Buoyancy fun fact.

15:26.091 --> 15:29.762
Buoyancy is just the measurement of
an object's ability to float on a fluid.

15:29.845 --> 15:31.597
You can calculate an object's buoyancy

15:31.680 --> 15:34.475
by finding the volume of water
that it displaces

15:35.601 --> 15:37.937
and multiplying it
by the density of the water,

15:38.020 --> 15:41.649
which, as everybody knows,
is 62.4 pounds per cubic foot,

15:41.732 --> 15:43.359
and then compare that to total--

15:43.442 --> 15:45.235
-Nerd. What?
-Nerd.

15:46.153 --> 15:48.489
-I don't think Graz is--
-No. Just keep going. Yeah

15:49.323 --> 15:52.952
Look, this boat might be heavy,
but it's also wide and flat,

15:53.035 --> 15:56.538
which means the water it displaces
is gonna be even heavier.

15:56.622 --> 16:00.459
And so, because of that,
it's gonna float… probably.

16:01.001 --> 16:03.796
-Graz and Pat plus the weight of the boat.
-Nerd.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.757
-That can't be close to 5,000 pounds.
-Nerd.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.093
All right. Keep doing your math, nerd.

16:09.176 --> 16:10.010
Nerd.

16:11.011 --> 16:12.721
I'm just misunderstood.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.892
I'll trust that Jackman
is right on the math.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.770
In the meantime,
we're gonna focus on stacking,

16:20.729 --> 16:21.814
gluing,

16:22.731 --> 16:26.276
and carving these boards until
they look like an actual guitar neck.

16:35.285 --> 16:37.496
This is a classic paddle.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.791
But I'm not classic.

16:42.751 --> 16:44.712
I'm going to do that the Pat way.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.091
Let's do that.

16:49.675 --> 16:53.387
First part is the handle, which I'm gonna
make with that piece of walnut.

16:57.933 --> 17:01.645
Now, I'm heading over to the band saw
to remove the bulk of the material,

17:02.813 --> 17:05.858
then I'm going to mount this on the lathe,
and make this round.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.071
The grinder.

17:13.490 --> 17:14.408
Hey!

17:16.910 --> 17:17.995
Oh yes.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.046
We are laying out the acoustic hole.

17:27.129 --> 17:30.090
According to our calculations,
it's about 16 inches.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.550
What a beauty.

17:32.384 --> 17:35.387
By taking measurements
of a normal guitar and scaling them up,

17:35.471 --> 17:37.931
we know about where
the sound hole's gonna be,

17:38.015 --> 17:40.100
but we might wanna make some adjustments.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.478
The hole may need to be further down.

17:42.561 --> 17:45.647
So I'll cut out the circle,
we'll lay it out there. See how it goes.

17:48.025 --> 17:50.652
So Derek just cut out a circle,

17:50.736 --> 17:52.446
and I think it's an appropriate size.

17:52.529 --> 17:55.532
I think whatever
Jimmy thinks looks right, is right.

17:55.616 --> 17:58.619
We'll use this now
as a template to cut the hole.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.960
-We have a hole.
-This is coming out all right, huh?

18:08.879 --> 18:10.547
Plywood gives you wings.

18:11.340 --> 18:14.009
What we have here is…
Derek, would you like to explain?

18:14.093 --> 18:15.052
Bendy plywood.

18:15.135 --> 18:16.804
-And what does it do?
-It bends.

18:16.887 --> 18:17.721
Around?

18:17.805 --> 18:19.264
Curved surfaces?

18:19.348 --> 18:21.225
-The side of our guitar.
-Oh.

18:23.143 --> 18:26.563
This bendy plywood is made
by taking thin strips of fine-grain wood

18:26.647 --> 18:29.149
and gluing them
with their grains running parallel,

18:29.233 --> 18:32.528
so that they stay together
while still being flexible.

18:32.611 --> 18:33.862
It's bendy.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.989
It does like the name implies.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.241
It bends.

18:37.324 --> 18:40.160
First, we'll glue a piece
of the bendy plywood in place…

18:40.244 --> 18:41.620
-Here on the seam?
-Yep.

18:41.703 --> 18:43.247
…so we can line it up.

18:43.330 --> 18:45.165
And then we add a few staples.

18:49.503 --> 18:52.172
Uhh, okay. Maybe a lot of staples.

18:52.256 --> 18:53.507
All right.

18:53.590 --> 18:55.467
And our boat has sides.

18:55.551 --> 18:58.262
It's gonna give this thing
immediate strength.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.726
All right. Check it out!

19:05.310 --> 19:07.563
Wow! What do you got going on here, kid?

19:07.646 --> 19:09.606
-What do you think?
-Um…

19:09.690 --> 19:11.066
Your car battery died?

19:11.150 --> 19:13.485
-We're not jumping my car.
-Okay.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.571
We are making lightning bolts.

19:15.654 --> 19:17.322
Let me guess. Lichtenberg?

19:17.865 --> 19:18.699
Bam!

19:18.782 --> 19:21.702
Lichtenberg burning is a process
of burning patterns into wood

19:21.785 --> 19:23.120
using electricity.

19:23.203 --> 19:27.624
We just cover the wood in conductive paste
and run an electric charge across it.

19:27.708 --> 19:31.044
The results look like
tiny lightning bolts burned into the wood.

19:31.128 --> 19:33.797
So electricity plus conductive liquid

19:33.881 --> 19:36.258
equals lightning bolts in wood.

19:36.341 --> 19:38.343
-This is electrolytes?
-This is electrolytes.

19:38.427 --> 19:39.803
-Like Gatorade?
-Exactly.

19:40.637 --> 19:41.930
But nothing like it.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.725
-Yeah. No? Okay. You ready?
-I don't think so.

19:44.808 --> 19:47.269
Three, two, one.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.147
There it goes.

19:54.902 --> 19:56.862
Look at that. Fractals.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.531
Isn't that crazy how it does that?

20:09.416 --> 20:11.376
Whoo! Look at that.

20:11.460 --> 20:12.961
Wow. That looks great.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.588
I think Jayden's gonna like this.

20:14.671 --> 20:17.841
He asked for lightning bolts,
we gave him lightning bolts.

20:17.925 --> 20:21.511
Let's go down to the barn, show Jimmy,
and put this thing on the guitar.

20:22.596 --> 20:24.640
This is what you call
poor man's wood filler.

20:24.723 --> 20:26.475
Glue and sawdust.

20:31.563 --> 20:34.691
I'm sanding out all the little bumps,
nicks, banging in all the nails

20:34.775 --> 20:38.195
because now we're going to cover it
with the final wood for the face.

20:38.278 --> 20:39.238
Walnut veneer.

20:39.321 --> 20:42.824
So we'll take this walnut veneer
and put it on the outsides of our boat

20:42.908 --> 20:43.951
and move on.

20:44.034 --> 20:45.369
Two-twenty-six.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.579
There's no need
to make a big thing of this.

20:49.414 --> 20:52.125
You're gonna make me
make a big thing of this, aren't you?

20:52.626 --> 20:56.505
All right. Fine. I'll do it,
but only in the form of soft rock.

20:56.588 --> 20:57.422
Huh?

20:59.758 --> 21:02.886
So how is veneer made, you ask?

21:04.096 --> 21:06.265
They take a big, giant razor blade,

21:06.348 --> 21:08.600
and the editors
are gonna show you right here…

21:09.142 --> 21:12.229
Take a big razor blade
and put a log against that razor blade,

21:12.312 --> 21:13.480
and you spin the log.

21:13.563 --> 21:15.107
Big industrial machinery.

21:15.190 --> 21:18.777
And they take a log and unroll it
just like a roll of paper towels.

21:41.591 --> 21:44.803
Most of your overpriced
dining tables have this on top.

21:45.554 --> 21:46.596
Not real wood.

21:48.890 --> 21:52.060
This is contact cement.
It's called a dry-mount contact cement.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.854
Put it on both sides coming together.

21:53.937 --> 21:55.772
You let both sides dry,

21:55.856 --> 21:59.693
and then you push it together,
and it stays forever.

22:00.277 --> 22:03.572
If you put it down wrong, you have to rip
it off and start again with a new piece.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.180
Walnut, huh?

22:28.764 --> 22:29.973
It's a veneer.

22:30.057 --> 22:31.767
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's fancy.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.477
I, I have a table like this.

22:33.560 --> 22:36.772
Me and Christina got married,
we bought a table just like this.

22:36.855 --> 22:38.398
How much you pay for it?

22:38.482 --> 22:40.734
-A ton.
-Interesting.

22:40.817 --> 22:42.319
See? What did I tell you?

22:42.402 --> 22:44.321
Everybody overpays for veneer.

22:58.335 --> 23:01.296
Jimmy, when you hurt your pinky
in the table saw accident,

23:01.380 --> 23:03.215
were you still able to play?

23:03.298 --> 23:05.675
I was despondent about the circumstance.

23:05.759 --> 23:09.346
I should have kept practicing,
but I used it as an excuse to give up.

23:09.429 --> 23:11.640
Does it bother you to drink tea at all?

23:11.723 --> 23:14.768
No, actually, that's perfect
because the pinky doesn't move.

23:14.851 --> 23:17.270
So when I drink tea,
it's in the perfect position.

23:18.021 --> 23:20.649
<i>Attention, Jimmy. Children calling.</i>

23:21.608 --> 23:24.653
<i>Attention, Jimmy.</i>
<i>Time to talk to the kids again.</i>

23:24.736 --> 23:27.280
-Jeez. Hey. What's up, buddy?
-There he is.

23:27.364 --> 23:31.660
<i>I just came in to check in.</i>
<i>See how you guys were doing.</i>

23:31.743 --> 23:34.496
The big, giant guitar is well underway.

23:34.579 --> 23:37.082
<i>-What are the colors?</i>
It's gonna look like a guitar.

23:37.165 --> 23:38.250
What did you expect?

23:39.000 --> 23:40.961
<i>-Touchè. Uh…</i>

23:41.044 --> 23:43.380
<i>Can it actually function like a guitar?</i>

23:43.463 --> 23:45.132
<i>Does it actually play music?</i>

23:45.757 --> 23:47.801
Not at the moment. Why do you ask?

23:47.884 --> 23:49.428
<i>Because I want it to.</i>

23:49.511 --> 23:51.680
-<i>Uh-oh!</i>

23:53.682 --> 23:55.976
<i>Time to face the music.</i>

23:56.643 --> 23:58.645
You want it to play like a real guitar?

23:58.728 --> 24:00.397
<i>Yes, yes, yes, yes.</i>

24:00.480 --> 24:03.859
Jayden, you know, we're trying
to make it a legit floating boat.

24:03.942 --> 24:06.319
Sound isn't really exactly the priority.

24:06.403 --> 24:07.821
<i>It'll sound good though.</i>

24:07.904 --> 24:09.906
All right. Yes, we're gonna
have it make sound.

24:09.990 --> 24:13.076
You got us at the right time.
We can still have it make sound.

24:13.160 --> 24:13.994
<i>Yay!</i>

24:14.077 --> 24:16.246
But going forward,
adding the frets and the strings…

24:16.788 --> 24:18.748
we're gonna keep in mind
that it will really work.

24:18.832 --> 24:20.500
<i>-Yeah.</i>
-All right.

24:20.584 --> 24:21.418
<i>Dealio.</i>

24:21.918 --> 24:23.795
-I'll check in when we're done.
-See you.

24:24.379 --> 24:27.132
-We gotta make it make music.
-So it's playing music.

24:27.215 --> 24:30.802
We were always planning on adding
the strings, the frets, the tuning pegs,

24:30.886 --> 24:33.847
but they were gonna be
purely ornamental, not functional.

24:34.347 --> 24:37.184
So we're gonna build
tuning pegs that can actually rotate

24:37.267 --> 24:41.229
and tighten these big, heavy cables enough
to where they will play notes.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.189
Somewhat.

24:42.272 --> 24:45.358
And Jackman and Graz
will have to adjust their neck…

24:45.442 --> 24:48.069
I'm gonna have to reinforce
the structure inside the body a bit.

24:48.153 --> 24:51.239
…so that it can accommodate
actual playable strings.

24:51.323 --> 24:53.283
He didn't say
it had to sound good, did he?

24:53.366 --> 24:55.869
-It just has to make sound.
-Yeah. It just makes sound.

24:56.369 --> 24:59.539
We've still got a lot of work
to do on the other parts of the build.

24:59.623 --> 25:01.708
Time to kick it into beast mode.

25:03.084 --> 25:03.919
Oh.

25:06.922 --> 25:09.424
Pat's gonna finish
his guitar pick paddles

25:09.508 --> 25:12.761
with a layer of waterproof epoxy
and some colorful paint.

25:19.768 --> 25:23.188
I don't know what this does, but I saw it
on the internet, and it looks cool.

25:25.398 --> 25:26.274
Oh yeah.

25:32.656 --> 25:33.615
Look at that.

25:33.698 --> 25:35.075
-It's nice, right?
-I like that one.

25:35.158 --> 25:38.495
Back on the body, Derek and I
are gonna cut some holes for seats.

25:38.578 --> 25:40.121
Right now, we've got a guitar raft.

25:40.205 --> 25:43.416
It won't be a guitar boat
until Pat and Graz have a place to sit.

25:46.336 --> 25:47.337
Whoo!

25:48.046 --> 25:50.173
Guys, wanna come over and give this a try?

25:50.257 --> 25:52.092
-Yeah.
-Help me with my leg.

25:52.842 --> 25:54.302
-Oh God.
-Woo-hoo!

25:56.638 --> 25:57.472
How's this?

25:57.556 --> 25:59.057
You guys look good in it.

25:59.140 --> 26:02.894
I thought my casket was gonna
look different, but I'm okay with this.

26:05.939 --> 26:09.526
Finally, Pat is carving
some wooden tuning knobs on the band saw

26:09.609 --> 26:12.112
so we can actually
tighten the strings on the neck.

26:12.195 --> 26:16.032
To make it look like metal,
I'm gonna wrap this with chrome vinyl.

26:35.385 --> 26:37.345
-Nice and smooth.
-The head stock's done.

26:37.429 --> 26:38.805
-Looks awesome.
-That's good.

26:38.888 --> 26:40.724
All right. Up next, frets.

26:40.807 --> 26:44.644
Originally, we were going to
make the frets and strings ornamental,

26:44.728 --> 26:47.647
but then the strings
would sit flush against the fretboard

26:47.731 --> 26:48.898
and wouldn't sound good.

26:48.982 --> 26:50.942
Since Jayden wants
the guitar to make sound,

26:51.026 --> 26:53.069
we're setting these frets
at precise depths,

26:53.153 --> 26:56.197
so they'll lift the strings off
the fretboard and let them ring out.

26:56.281 --> 26:59.534
We'll mark out the locations of the frets.
I'll cut a bunch of grooves here.

26:59.618 --> 27:04.164
All right. You fret, I'll glue,
and we'll get in a pretty good groove.

27:07.667 --> 27:09.085
What are you fretting about?

27:09.169 --> 27:10.837
-Are you done?
-Yeah. I'm done.

27:10.920 --> 27:11.921
-Good.
-Let's go.

27:13.423 --> 27:15.383
Put that over on that side.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.135
There we go. Right here.

27:17.218 --> 27:19.220
We know
how we're gonna add frets,

27:19.304 --> 27:21.681
but we still need to figure out
where exactly to put this

27:21.765 --> 27:23.516
so we'll be able to play a song.

27:23.600 --> 27:26.478
And you know me,
I'm not just gonna eyeball it.

27:26.561 --> 27:28.813
I did the math earlier.
I took a screenshot.

27:28.897 --> 27:30.482
You took a screenshot of math?

27:30.565 --> 27:32.192
-Yeah.
-Okay.

27:32.275 --> 27:35.070
That's all the dimensions
of where the frets want to be.

27:35.153 --> 27:37.322
The fret scale's 173 inches.

27:38.073 --> 27:42.160
Jackman, you're the only person
I've ever met that makes guitars uncool.

27:42.243 --> 27:44.788
-Done?
-All right. Let's cut some grooves.

27:46.039 --> 27:48.124
Jayden wants this to sound like a guitar.

27:48.208 --> 27:50.293
So we have to get the fret spacing right.

27:52.754 --> 27:54.547
I'm gonna glue in these steel rods

27:55.465 --> 27:57.842
while Jackman
cuts the rest of the grooves.

27:59.594 --> 28:01.137
Since we measured the frets carefully,

28:01.221 --> 28:03.473
these strings are gonna sit
at the perfect height

28:03.556 --> 28:05.392
to vibrate freely and make sound.

28:06.893 --> 28:08.103
Kind of like Jimmy.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.481
And once the frets are all set in place…

28:14.234 --> 28:16.903
we'll trim off the edges
so they sit flush with the fretboard.

28:18.446 --> 28:20.115
-Paul, this looks great.
-Thanks.

28:20.198 --> 28:23.868
Jackman, this really does.
It looks like a giant guitar neck.

28:23.952 --> 28:25.954
It's gonna look awesome
when we put strings on it.

28:26.037 --> 28:28.665
-Well done.
-Let's clamp these while the epoxy cures.

28:28.748 --> 28:30.375
Then we put the neck on the body.

28:30.458 --> 28:32.085
-Let's get more clamps.
-All right.

28:33.753 --> 28:37.132
<i>Nerd! Nerd! Nerd!</i>

28:37.924 --> 28:39.426
Are you guys ready?

28:39.509 --> 28:43.430
All hands on deck!
It's time to assemble a giant guitar.

28:43.513 --> 28:45.306
-Are you ready for this?
-Are you ready?

28:45.390 --> 28:46.891
-Are you good?
-Yeah.

28:52.147 --> 28:53.148
Let's see.

28:53.982 --> 28:56.151
-Oh boy.
-Oh jeez.

28:57.277 --> 28:59.779
Hang on, guys.
I need the "made a mistake" tool.

29:08.329 --> 29:10.415
-Let's see if that fits.
Take two.

29:11.541 --> 29:12.917
Oh, look at that.

29:13.001 --> 29:14.878
Now that we know the neck fits,

29:14.961 --> 29:17.589
we can start gluing
the two pieces together.

29:17.672 --> 29:20.091
-Tell me when. Okay?
-Let's send it.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.887
Just a little more. Right there.

29:25.847 --> 29:28.349
The neck is attached to the body.
This is looking sharp.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.685
Now we gotta work
on putting the strings on.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.813
We gotta epoxy the bottom.
I gotta install the seats.

29:33.897 --> 29:35.982
Let's bring it home, boys. Let's go!

29:36.065 --> 29:38.443
-Bring it home, boys.
-Bring it home, boys.

29:41.696 --> 29:43.823
<i>Ahoy there, matey!</i>

29:46.576 --> 29:47.911
Oh, whoo!

29:47.994 --> 29:49.621
Guitars were made to rock…

29:49.704 --> 29:50.622
Whoa, it's hot!

29:50.705 --> 29:52.707
…but ours needs to float as well.

29:52.791 --> 29:57.879
What I'm doing is pouring epoxy to fill in
all the crevices and potential leak areas.

29:58.463 --> 30:02.300
So we need to seal the inside
of the guitar body with epoxy resin.

30:02.383 --> 30:04.427
I just dump it in and let it cure.

30:04.511 --> 30:07.430
-It's not dripping out, is it?
-There's a screw hole there.

30:07.514 --> 30:10.767
When it drips through, it'll cure
in the hole, then it's patched.

30:12.560 --> 30:17.357
Derek has to cut the Lichtenberg figures
he and Graz made into angled segments…

30:17.440 --> 30:20.109
I'm gonna cut 12 of them at 15 degrees.

30:20.193 --> 30:23.696
…to create the rosette design
that's gonna go around the sound hole.

30:25.490 --> 30:26.741
It looks good.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.327
Jayden wanted lightning bolts.
He should be happy with this.

30:30.411 --> 30:34.082
The dot inlays are traditionally
made of pearl or other fine materials,

30:34.916 --> 30:37.293
but we're using wooden dowels
to mark our fretboard.

30:38.628 --> 30:40.547
Since Jayden wants this thing to play,

30:40.630 --> 30:43.967
we need to install a nut
that we cut from two-inch thick plastic,

30:45.760 --> 30:48.763
a bridge made from a pipe
welded to a metal plate…

30:51.182 --> 30:54.018
and of course, a set of six strings
made from steel cable

30:55.520 --> 30:57.480
that we'll run from tuning pegs,

30:57.564 --> 31:00.650
down the neck, over the bridge,
and through the body.

31:02.485 --> 31:04.153
-Ready?

31:04.237 --> 31:05.196
You hear that?

31:05.280 --> 31:06.823
That's beautiful.

31:09.117 --> 31:11.244
And to finish everything off,

31:12.704 --> 31:16.207
we're gonna build two seats
out of beautiful, burgundy marine vinyl.

31:16.291 --> 31:17.458
Looks like a roadster.

31:17.542 --> 31:20.169
Nothing but the best
for Graz and Pat's tushies.

31:20.253 --> 31:22.422
-We'll make some beautiful music with it.
-Oh yeah.

31:23.840 --> 31:24.757
Looks good.

31:24.841 --> 31:26.718
Hopefully this thing is gonna float.

31:27.969 --> 31:31.014
Man, we guitar-dly got it done in time.

31:33.141 --> 31:34.392
Guys, fantastic work.

31:34.475 --> 31:37.562
Everybody's talents
are really well showcased in this one.

31:37.645 --> 31:39.230
-That's all we can do.
-All right.

31:39.939 --> 31:40.940
It's beautiful.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.495
Music and boats go hand in hand.

31:54.579 --> 31:56.331
-Yeah.
-I'm sorry. What?

31:56.414 --> 31:59.167
Music, boats. They go hand in hand.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.586
-You know what's music to my ears?
-What's that?

32:01.669 --> 32:03.671
Us being done with this episode.

32:03.755 --> 32:05.048
Let's do the reveal.

32:07.008 --> 32:08.509
All right. Let's get Jayden up here.

32:08.593 --> 32:10.845
See if he appreciates
what we've built for him.

32:11.888 --> 32:13.640
-Jayden!
<i>-Hello!</i>

32:13.723 --> 32:15.725
-How are you, buddy?
<i>-Really good.</i>

32:15.808 --> 32:18.770
Okay, Jayden.
Pop quiz. Why are we here?

32:18.853 --> 32:20.355
Yeah. Why?

32:20.438 --> 32:22.941
<i>Because I wanted you to build me a guitar.</i>

32:23.024 --> 32:24.067
A guitar.

32:24.150 --> 32:27.278
So we built a giant 500-pound guitar,

32:27.362 --> 32:28.446
but that wasn't enough.

32:28.529 --> 32:31.824
<i>I wanted it to float on the water!</i>

32:31.908 --> 32:35.244
You wanted it to become a boat
that has to float.

32:35.328 --> 32:36.412
<i>Is it gonna float?</i>

32:36.496 --> 32:38.081
Of course, it's gonna float.

32:38.164 --> 32:38.998
Ehh…

32:39.082 --> 32:40.625
<i>Come on. Can I see it already?</i>

32:40.708 --> 32:42.835
-Do you really wanna see this thing?
<i>-Yes!</i>

32:42.919 --> 32:44.545
You're approaching a three.

32:45.129 --> 32:47.799
Get close to a nine,
maybe we'll open those garage doors.

32:47.882 --> 32:50.468
<i>Fine, fine, fine. Fine. Fine, fine, fine.</i>

32:50.551 --> 32:51.886
Uh-oh. There we go.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.096
<i>Jayden style.</i>

32:56.975 --> 32:58.768
All right. You earned it.

32:58.851 --> 33:00.019
Guys, hit it!

33:12.281 --> 33:13.866
<i>That is so cool!</i>

33:15.284 --> 33:16.661
<i>I love it! I love it!</i>

33:20.665 --> 33:21.833
<i>Oh my goodness!</i>

33:21.916 --> 33:23.292
<i>It's so cool!</i>

33:25.586 --> 33:28.965
Jayden, what you're looking at
is 19 feet of guitar excellence

33:29.048 --> 33:30.508
that's gonna float on the water.

33:30.591 --> 33:31.759
<i>That's humongous!</i>

33:31.843 --> 33:33.970
Look at the guitar body.
Me and Derek built it.

33:34.053 --> 33:35.805
It's made out of layers of plywood,

33:35.888 --> 33:38.433
It's beautifully veneered
with walnut on the sides

33:38.516 --> 33:39.767
and maple on the top.

33:39.851 --> 33:41.185
<i>That's a lot of wood!</i>

33:41.269 --> 33:42.937
Hey, Jayden. See this ring here?

33:43.021 --> 33:44.731
You wanted your lightning bolts?

33:44.814 --> 33:47.066
Me and Graz burnt these with electricity.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.151
<i>That's awesome!</i>

33:48.234 --> 33:51.070
The neck is laminated
from butcher block countertops

33:51.154 --> 33:55.366
that's oak and maple, with a fretboard
made of ash and actual metal frets.

33:55.450 --> 33:57.910
It is 8 feet long
plus 2 feet for the headstock.

33:57.994 --> 34:01.122
Did you see your name
on the headstock? It says "Jayden."

34:01.205 --> 34:04.792
When they find me and Pat's bodies,
your name will be all over the evidence.

34:06.335 --> 34:08.171
You can't have a boat without a paddle.

34:08.254 --> 34:10.840
If you see these two
beautiful paddles made by Pat.

34:10.923 --> 34:14.761
The handles are made of black walnut,
and I've carved it on the lathe.

34:14.844 --> 34:16.679
And as for the pick itselves,

34:16.763 --> 34:21.934
I used plywood, and I did an epoxy pour
with two and three colors. I mixed it.

34:22.018 --> 34:24.312
<i>The picks look so cool!</i>

34:24.395 --> 34:26.606
-It looks incredible.
<i>-But does it play?</i>

34:26.689 --> 34:28.816
-Want to hear something?
<i>-Yes!</i>

34:38.659 --> 34:41.079
<i>It warms my heart. It's so beautiful.</i>

34:41.162 --> 34:43.372
I bet you wanna
see this thing in the water.

34:43.456 --> 34:44.415
-Don't you?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

34:44.499 --> 34:47.210
Jayden, be honest.
Do you think this is gonna float?

34:47.293 --> 34:49.754
<i>There's only one way to find out.</i>

34:49.837 --> 34:51.089
You heard him, guys.

34:54.383 --> 34:56.344
You guys okay back there?

35:10.608 --> 35:11.526
Oh, jeez!

35:12.777 --> 35:14.862
You guys ready? Let's get Jayden up.

35:15.947 --> 35:18.491
What's up, buddy?
Can you see where we are?

35:18.574 --> 35:19.617
<i>Yeah!</i>

35:19.700 --> 35:21.661
<i>And I see the boat in the back.</i>

35:21.744 --> 35:24.163
<i>It's actually floating!</i>

35:24.247 --> 35:27.458
It's one thing to have the boat float,
but it's a different thing

35:27.542 --> 35:30.419
to have a bearded Canadian
and a little, hairy man climb into it.

35:30.503 --> 35:31.754
And that's about to happen.

35:31.838 --> 35:32.880
<i>Yes!</i>

35:32.964 --> 35:34.423
Are you two nitwits ready?

35:34.507 --> 35:36.175
Permission to step aboard?

35:36.259 --> 35:37.093
Granted.

35:39.804 --> 35:42.557
Make sure it's not slippery.
Make sure you don't slip.

35:42.640 --> 35:43.641
I got it.

35:43.724 --> 35:45.935
-Uh-oh!
-Whoo!

35:46.769 --> 35:48.771
-Perfect.
<i>-All right. Let's see!</i>

35:49.856 --> 35:52.316
-Mr. Pat Lap, your paddle.
Thank you!

35:52.817 --> 35:55.069
All right, guys. Take it away!

36:01.284 --> 36:02.577
It works!

36:04.120 --> 36:06.414
-Pat, this is kind of nice, right?
-Yeah.

36:12.962 --> 36:14.380
I think it's working.

36:22.805 --> 36:24.348
Jayden, what do you think?

36:25.183 --> 36:29.604
<i>Awesome! I can't believe</i>
<i>there's an actual guitar boat.</i>

36:29.687 --> 36:31.898
Hey, Jackman, Derek!
Do I look cool?

36:31.981 --> 36:33.566
Yeah. Real cool.

36:34.817 --> 36:38.779
Jayden, there's one more thing
we got for you. Pat, hit it.

37:07.266 --> 37:08.601
-Whoa!
Whoa!

37:20.238 --> 37:21.822
That was beautiful, Pat.

37:21.906 --> 37:25.034
Jayden, I think we're done here.
Any final words?

37:25.117 --> 37:27.245
<i>Thank you for building me a guitar boat!</i>

37:27.328 --> 37:29.705
You're very welcome.
And I'll see you later.

37:30.206 --> 37:32.166
-Bye, buddy.
-See you, Jayden.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.626
I knew you'd love this one.

37:33.709 --> 37:36.796
Congrats. Give ourselves
a round of applause. You did so well.

37:38.798 --> 37:39.840
All right, guys.

37:41.217 --> 37:42.551
I'll see you at the workshop.

37:42.635 --> 37:44.053
-Wait.
-What about the boat?

37:44.136 --> 37:45.221
Can you pull us in?

37:45.304 --> 37:46.847
You got the rope. You're good.
