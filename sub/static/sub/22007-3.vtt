WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:07.208
Jeff: Previously on
"survivor": The hero tribe, Alan

00:07.241 --> 00:11.379
was aiming to take out a power
couple.

00:11.412 --> 00:15.483
Whatever jp is actually
trying to do, I'm blowing it up.

00:15.516 --> 00:19.187
Jeff: At the healer tribe,
Joe and Cole went on the hunt

00:19.220 --> 00:20.521
for an idol.

00:20.554 --> 00:20.988
Got it.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.256
Yeah.

00:22.290 --> 00:25.859
The fact that Cole knows that
I have the idol could absolutely

00:25.893 --> 00:27.027
backfire.

00:27.061 --> 00:29.063
Jeff: At the hustler tribe,
Simone and Patrick were the

00:29.097 --> 00:30.331
clear targets.

00:30.364 --> 00:34.302
Simone's not that great at
challenges, but Patrick, even

00:34.335 --> 00:37.505
though he's strong, I don't
trust him.

00:37.538 --> 00:41.542
Jeff: At tribal council,
Patrick made a questionable

00:41.575 --> 00:42.610
remark.

00:42.643 --> 00:48.015
I feel like I can trust most
of the people here.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.518
Jeff: But in the end,
Simone was sent home.

00:50.551 --> 00:54.855
Simone, the tribe has spoken.

00:54.888 --> 00:55.956
16 are left.

00:55.989 --> 01:01.129
Who will be voted out tonight?

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:17.077 --> 01:17.845
It's big on me.

01:17.878 --> 01:20.114
Here, let me try it on with
that.

01:20.148 --> 01:23.317
I look like Willy Wonka.

01:23.351 --> 01:25.419
Simone's clothing was up for
grabs.

01:25.453 --> 01:26.620
It was kind of like a yard sale.

01:26.654 --> 01:29.857
She left a lot of of clothing
here, including a nice pair of

01:29.890 --> 01:31.058
boots, a nice pair of pants, a
blazer.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.061
It's like your "Miami vice"
look.

01:34.094 --> 01:34.462
Look at that.

01:34.495 --> 01:35.363
A perfect fit.

01:35.396 --> 01:41.068
You're like my kid getting ready
for prom.

01:41.101 --> 01:42.536
How about the boots?

01:42.570 --> 01:43.871
Zip them up.

01:43.904 --> 01:46.540
Zip me up.

01:46.574 --> 01:49.076
The practicality of the
knee-high boots is, it goes on

01:49.109 --> 01:54.982
I mean, you could avoid crack
when does you're idol searching.

01:55.015 --> 01:59.687
Finally, Simone is showing her
worth in some capacity.

01:59.720 --> 02:04.091
I think we should wait until
the girls get back wash the

02:04.124 --> 02:05.259
I don't want to make Lauren mad.

02:05.293 --> 02:06.894
Do you have a preference
between the two?

02:06.927 --> 02:07.661
Ali.

02:07.695 --> 02:08.395
To go?

02:08.429 --> 02:09.163
To stay.

02:09.197 --> 02:09.896
You?

02:09.930 --> 02:11.832
I like Ali.

02:11.865 --> 02:16.103
Ali is the most relatable female
that is on our tribe.

02:16.136 --> 02:20.441
She's in the same age range as
us, so that's a knock on Lauren.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.510
I don't think anybody has
anything going on with Lauren,

02:22.543 --> 02:35.122
so that's why she's probably the
next one to go.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.123
* *
were you nervous last night?

02:36.156 --> 02:39.026
Of course, you're always
nervous.

02:39.059 --> 02:40.294
How about me and you, like?

02:40.328 --> 02:43.597
Because it's getting down to... i
mean, if we have another... if we

02:43.631 --> 02:45.399
go to another tribal council,
then what?

02:45.433 --> 02:46.300
Yeah.

02:46.334 --> 02:48.202
What...
I think that if we just, you

02:48.236 --> 02:51.672
know, kind of keep the way we
are, whatever happens in the

02:51.705 --> 02:54.242
next few days.

02:54.275 --> 02:57.245
Even though I didn't get any
votes at tribal council, I still

02:57.278 --> 03:02.683
feel like I'm on the outs,
because I'm having a hard time

03:02.716 --> 03:05.353
trying to make sure that I'm
included.

03:05.386 --> 03:05.719
Come join us.

03:05.753 --> 03:06.119
Oh, yeah?

03:06.153 --> 03:07.721
It's nice!

03:07.755 --> 03:09.122
Am I invited?

03:09.156 --> 03:12.726
Being a single mother, I am
the only one on my tribe that,

03:12.760 --> 03:14.061
you know, has a kid.

03:14.094 --> 03:17.365
And my tribe members, they're
like holly buddies.

03:17.398 --> 03:20.033
And I'm like the damn teacher.

03:20.067 --> 03:22.536
Poor pat.

03:22.570 --> 03:26.740
Pat, I mean,... mmm.

03:26.774 --> 03:28.342
How fast is your heart beating?

03:28.376 --> 03:29.910
I didn't like what he said.

03:29.943 --> 03:30.778
That made me nervous.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.546
Yeah.

03:32.580 --> 03:37.150
Patrick at tribal he said, "I
trust almost everyone here."

03:37.184 --> 03:40.120
Well, I don't know if that was
really directed towards Simone

03:40.153 --> 03:41.889
or was that directed towards all
of us?

03:41.922 --> 03:46.460
But now it's given me the
opportunity to put the target on

03:46.494 --> 03:47.295
Patrick.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.062
When you say that in front of
all us.

03:49.096 --> 03:50.298
Yeah.

03:50.331 --> 03:55.903
It does kind of put people
un-at ease with you, because is

03:55.936 --> 03:57.170
it all of them or most of them?

03:57.204 --> 03:59.840
I have no idea what's going
on with Patrick.

03:59.873 --> 04:02.810
At tribal council, he's just
blurting out words.

04:02.843 --> 04:03.744
Don't know.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.879
We are more calmer than he is.

04:05.913 --> 04:10.718
But if Patrick goes, we're
not going to be as strong in

04:10.751 --> 04:11.419
challenges.

04:11.452 --> 04:12.920
It looks like a photo shoot.

04:12.953 --> 04:16.189
He brings a lot in
competitions and he works

04:16.223 --> 04:18.692
extremely hard, and I think
that's easier to tolerate than

04:18.726 --> 04:21.028
someone who doesn't really bring
much at all.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.930
Hey, look at the octopus.

04:22.963 --> 04:23.631
That's a rock!

04:23.664 --> 04:24.832
Look at him now.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.066
Are you all stupid?

04:26.099 --> 04:30.237
Patrick doesn't understand
that the social game is so huge

04:30.270 --> 04:33.474
for "survivor," but at this
point, I kind of need him, so I

04:33.507 --> 04:36.977
kind of need him not to say
things that rub people the wrong

04:37.010 --> 04:37.811
way.

04:37.845 --> 04:46.754
You all are all pissing me
off now.

04:46.787 --> 04:51.959
Captioning funded by CBS
and Ford.

04:51.992 --> 04:54.495
We go further, so you can.

04:55.028 --> 04:57.030
( Theme song playing )

05:29.329 --> 05:32.433
Tribe, at this point, you could
say that Chrissy and I are

05:32.466 --> 05:33.767
driving the train.

05:33.801 --> 05:36.504
But moving forward, Chrissy and
I need to figure out who's going

05:36.537 --> 05:37.671
to be the next target.

05:37.705 --> 05:41.308
Ashley is a good, hard worker
and she's fun so the better

05:41.341 --> 05:43.444
choices are jp and Alan.

05:43.477 --> 05:47.881
Alan and I were aligned on day
one, but Alan is a hot head and

05:47.915 --> 05:50.384
loose cannon, and jp is walking
around here like he don't know

05:50.418 --> 05:51.585
what's going on.

05:51.619 --> 05:54.622
But jp would be good to have
around cam because he does fish

05:54.655 --> 05:56.323
and everything.

05:56.356 --> 06:08.268
Right now, Chrissy and I haven't
made any decisions.

06:08.301 --> 06:12.305
Ah, I've been having trouble
with the coconuts.

06:12.339 --> 06:15.643
Everybody else has figured out
how to get the coconuts open,

06:15.676 --> 06:21.549
and I am struggling with them
and I don't know why.

06:21.582 --> 06:22.382
God dang it!

06:22.416 --> 06:23.517
It is a workout.

06:23.551 --> 06:27.855
It frustrates me that it
takes me 30 minutes to get a

06:27.888 --> 06:30.290
coconut open.

06:30.323 --> 06:38.566
( Laughing )
Take a break.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.901
This is not my element at
all.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.103
At the end of the day, I played
in the n.F.L., and I can't even

06:43.136 --> 06:46.339
get a coconut open.

06:46.373 --> 06:47.140
Get it.

06:47.174 --> 06:51.512
Almost.

06:51.545 --> 06:55.182
I tried to laugh about it so
people don't think, "oh, this

06:55.215 --> 06:57.451
guy can't even get a coconut
open."

06:57.485 --> 07:01.455
But it's tough out here.

07:05.593 --> 07:10.330
Jp is becoming, like,
dreamier and dreamier as the day

07:10.363 --> 07:11.565
goes on.

07:11.599 --> 07:14.001
Every time he walks out of the
ocean with a different animal on

07:14.034 --> 07:17.905
his spear, something happens
inside me.

07:17.938 --> 07:21.008
Whooo!

07:21.041 --> 07:23.711
That's a good size, jp.

07:23.744 --> 07:26.379
Yeah.

07:26.413 --> 07:29.783
He's becoming the provider,
and he's, you know, making

07:29.817 --> 07:32.052
himself more useful lately.

07:32.085 --> 07:35.322
And less and less like Alan as
the days go by.

07:35.355 --> 07:37.257
That's a good piece of fish.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.391
Yes, it is.

07:38.425 --> 07:40.060
Fut on a stick, cook it.

07:40.093 --> 07:40.594
What's up?

07:40.628 --> 07:41.629
That is beautiful!

07:41.662 --> 07:44.932
Not bad for a little guy,
huh?

07:44.965 --> 07:49.036
Jp and I, we can't talk to
each other, because on day two,

07:49.069 --> 07:52.439
Alan decided to go absolutely
nuts, calling out jp and I as

07:52.472 --> 07:53.607
some kind of power couple.

07:53.641 --> 07:58.478
Are we going to boil?

07:58.512 --> 07:58.979
Fry him?

07:59.012 --> 08:00.247
That's gorgeous.

08:00.280 --> 08:05.052
So now if Alan sees anything
between me and jp, he's going to

08:05.085 --> 08:06.920
point it out and he's going to
blow it up.

08:06.954 --> 08:10.323
So I'm ready for him to go,
because I don't know when he is

08:10.357 --> 08:11.525
going to go off again.

08:11.559 --> 08:14.762
I don't know if that was part of
some master plan he had, but

08:14.795 --> 08:18.465
either way, I don't like it, and
I could definitely do without

08:18.498 --> 08:20.167
him here anywhere.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.070
Jp has been doing more fishing
lately.

08:23.103 --> 08:25.005
Alan has been cutting more
coconuts lately.

08:25.038 --> 08:28.341
It feels like they both are
trying to be valuable, which is

08:28.375 --> 08:28.976
good.

08:29.009 --> 08:29.577
We all really are, I guess.

08:29.610 --> 08:30.678
Right.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.279
But you have to think about
your own personal game.

08:32.312 --> 08:36.116
It's, like, Alan, he makes his
moves out loud.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.751
Alan just doesn't seem look a
safe bet.

08:37.784 --> 08:40.187
Right, but neither does jp.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.990
Jp is just a puppy waited to be
led somewhere.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.258
But he can be our puppy.

08:45.292 --> 08:48.495
Yeah, but...
we could train him.

08:48.528 --> 08:52.399
But anyone else with a piece
of meat dangling in front of his

08:52.432 --> 08:52.733
face.

08:52.766 --> 08:53.500
Right.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.668
He's going to go towards
them.

08:54.702 --> 08:58.872
Yeah, but I feel like Alan
would do the same "my tribe

08:58.906 --> 08:59.707
thinks I'm crazy."

08:59.740 --> 09:02.342
Oh, yeah.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.145
Ashley is tossed to a power
couple.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.881
What's that is the truth or the
whole Alan thing but I can't

09:07.915 --> 09:11.118
fully trust Ashley at this point
because she keeps pug for jp to

09:11.151 --> 09:14.554
stay in the game, which makes me
think jp and Ashley are still

09:14.588 --> 09:16.590
working together.

09:16.624 --> 09:30.638
Normally, as a power couple on
"survivor" tdon't work out good.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.072
Sure.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.273
Are we bringing this bag?

09:33.306 --> 09:37.945
We can bring both bags in
case we catch this big fish.

09:37.978 --> 09:38.746
I'm feeling good.

09:38.779 --> 09:39.813
We've won every challenge.

09:39.847 --> 09:41.281
We are a dominant tribe.

09:41.314 --> 09:42.916
Life at camp is great.

09:42.950 --> 09:46.019
Everyone is still on the same
page, with Mike being the number

09:46.053 --> 09:47.120
one vote-out.

09:47.154 --> 09:49.623
I got everyone believing Mike
has the idol.

09:49.657 --> 09:52.392
So I'm cool and conflicted right
now.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.128
I mean, things couldn't really
go better at this point.

09:55.162 --> 09:58.899
The only thing is Cole knows I
have the idol so that's a

09:58.932 --> 10:00.000
concern of mine.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.670
I don't think Cole has told
anybody but I'm definitely

10:02.703 --> 10:05.338
concerned about his relationship
with Jessica.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.474
They have been spending a lot of
time together, fishing and

10:07.507 --> 10:08.608
things like that.

10:08.642 --> 10:11.912
Cole is like a love bird, and
that love bird disease is

10:11.945 --> 10:12.479
dangerous.

10:12.512 --> 10:21.021
It's worse than the flu.

10:21.989 --> 10:28.595
* *
the fishing experience is

10:28.628 --> 10:31.064
100% bonding for Cole and I
because it's really the only

10:31.098 --> 10:32.900
time we get to be alone,
together.

10:32.933 --> 10:36.603
And we're really forming a
connection.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.738
Got one.

10:37.771 --> 10:38.972
They're biting!

10:39.006 --> 10:41.241
I shouldn't have stayed down
there, that long.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.342
You could have had, like, five.

10:42.375 --> 10:45.112
But then life outside of
"survivor" I move like a slug

10:45.145 --> 10:47.247
when it comes to romance.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.850
Like, I don't even know if I
know what romance means.

10:49.883 --> 10:54.421
To be honest, I come from a
super-religious background, and

10:54.454 --> 10:55.622
I am a virgin.

10:55.655 --> 10:58.458
Oh, my god, I really... it's
awesome.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.628
I could stay down there for a
really long time.

11:01.661 --> 11:07.000
So my face feels red thinking
about him thinking about me.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.870
Being a couple on "survivor" is
hard.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.504
And it's dangerous.

11:11.538 --> 11:13.373
So we'll just have to wait and
see.

11:13.406 --> 11:19.646
We have a long time left
together, I hope.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.381
Are you enjoying yourself?

11:21.414 --> 11:23.283
Yeah, I'm having a blast.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.352
I like to be out here.

11:25.385 --> 11:26.253
Like, away from the game.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.120
Uh-huh.

11:27.154 --> 11:29.957
I feel like I can let my head
breathe.

11:29.990 --> 11:32.192
I'll shut up about the game
then.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.560
No, no, I want to talk about
the game.

11:33.593 --> 11:35.362
I can guarantee you that
you're safe.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.096
Yeah.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.498
I better be.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.668
You can't get to the end without
me.

11:41.701 --> 11:45.505
I don't know about that!

11:45.538 --> 11:48.776
But I 100% know that Mike
doesn't have the idol.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.744
Yeah.

11:50.778 --> 11:53.080
Because there's some other
information.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.314
What other information?

11:54.347 --> 11:58.285
I feel like I do have a shot
with Jessica after our outing

11:58.318 --> 11:59.419
today.

11:59.452 --> 12:01.688
She just showed me more of
herself, and I kept liking it.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.224
There wasn't anything I could
find wrong with her, honestly.

12:04.257 --> 12:07.460
So I was defining her as my
dream girl, I guess.

12:07.494 --> 12:13.166
So I decided I wanted to share
with her some information.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.435
So Joe has the idol.

12:15.468 --> 12:20.407
We found it together.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.308
Right?

12:21.341 --> 12:22.175
Right?

12:22.209 --> 12:27.447
I'm so... can I kiss you on
the cheek?

12:27.480 --> 12:32.585
Having the knowledge that Joe
has the idol brings me so much

12:32.619 --> 12:33.253
happiness.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.087
I'm going to go rinse off.

12:34.121 --> 12:36.489
Yup, yup.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.391
Secrets are really powerful in
this game.

12:38.425 --> 12:42.295
It's "survivor," and so it's to
my benefit that I know Joe's

12:42.329 --> 12:42.695
secret.

12:42.729 --> 12:45.665
That's power.

12:45.698 --> 12:48.836
So unrelated, I mean, I gave him
a kiss on the cheek.

12:48.869 --> 12:49.702
It just happened.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.504
My kisses are very private.

12:51.538 --> 12:55.042
Like, my lips don't go near
other people's cheeks very often

12:55.075 --> 12:56.810
so, this is big!

13:09.789 --> 13:15.028
Yup.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.197
You don't really search for the
idol in front of everybody

13:50.230 --> 13:52.966
because it's not good
relationship building, and it

13:53.000 --> 13:58.571
makes people parinoid.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.312
I do kind of have idol fever.

14:05.345 --> 14:06.679
I want the idol.

14:06.713 --> 14:09.983
Now, I mean, I'm not really
hiding looking for an idol and,

14:10.017 --> 14:14.221
you know, maybe that will turn
around and bite me, but being a

14:14.254 --> 14:15.388
hustler, we're always moving
along... pun intended.

14:15.422 --> 14:18.058
I have a moving company in
Alabama and the moving industry

14:18.091 --> 14:22.095
is it not stop... wheels always
on the ground, something always

14:22.129 --> 14:23.330
in motion.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.933
That's why the work harder than
the rest of my tribe members,

14:25.966 --> 14:27.667
looking for an idol.

14:27.700 --> 14:31.304
Me and Patrick have a pretty
good relationship, but he

14:31.338 --> 14:34.207
doesn't really have a social
game, and I want to look out for

14:34.241 --> 14:35.442
him.

14:35.475 --> 14:39.146
So I think that for my game, I
need to help Patrick mesh better

14:39.179 --> 14:40.380
with the group.

14:40.413 --> 14:44.184
You have to play smarter, pat,
you know, because you going idol

14:44.217 --> 14:47.921
crazy, is going to make people
think like, "why is he so

14:47.955 --> 14:49.056
worried?"
You know?

14:49.089 --> 14:50.323
All right.

14:50.357 --> 14:54.294
I'm just telling you because,
like, I don't want something to

14:54.327 --> 14:55.528
happen.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.331
She's looking out for my best
interest, and I'm looking out

14:58.365 --> 14:59.566
for hers as well.

14:59.599 --> 15:02.936
You know, I don't want your
name to be next or my name to be

15:02.970 --> 15:04.171
next.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.539
But Ali telling me to cool it
is difficult because it takes

15:06.573 --> 15:07.740
away from my personality.

15:07.774 --> 15:10.944
I may not be Abe to create
relationships if I'm not being

15:10.978 --> 15:11.478
me.

15:11.511 --> 15:14.014
Don't dwell on it.

15:14.047 --> 15:14.814
It's over.

15:14.847 --> 15:17.884
Can't change the past.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.819
Look forward the future pup
learn, though, learn from it.

15:19.852 --> 15:25.292
I will, always learn.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.338
Thanks for cooking, guys.

15:38.371 --> 15:39.272
My pleasure!

15:39.306 --> 15:40.573
Oh, my god!

15:40.607 --> 15:43.610
Yeah, that's pretty good.

15:43.643 --> 15:44.711
Not if it's raw.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.079
That one's completely raw.

15:46.113 --> 15:46.913
See the color.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.182
I just don't think we can be
picky.

15:49.216 --> 15:52.119
I mean... it's not being
picky.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.653
This is (Bleep) Completely raw.

15:53.686 --> 15:54.821
I'll eat it.

15:54.854 --> 15:57.524
I don't care.

15:57.557 --> 15:58.758
You'll eat the raw ones.

15:58.791 --> 16:04.731
Joe had some issue with the
way we cooked the pa-ta-tas, not

16:04.764 --> 16:08.135
wait he wanted them cooked at
exphoam if it's not to his

16:08.168 --> 16:11.438
liking he Chucks it in the woods
instead of offering it to

16:11.471 --> 16:15.575
somebody else to eat so that can
be a bit off-putting, when food

16:15.608 --> 16:16.143
is scarce.

16:16.176 --> 16:17.310
I can't eat raw food.

16:17.344 --> 16:18.911
I don't know how you all do it.

16:18.945 --> 16:22.715
Joe, you're welcome to cook
next time.

16:22.749 --> 16:25.652
Joe complains a lot sometimes
around camp.

16:25.685 --> 16:27.854
So he's already rubbed some
people the wrong way.

16:27.887 --> 16:30.223
And then on top of that, Joe has
the idol.

16:30.257 --> 16:33.560
And the more I thought about Joe
having the idol, the more I

16:33.593 --> 16:37.330
realize that Joe has all the
power, and I don't like that at

16:37.364 --> 16:37.764
all.

16:37.797 --> 16:40.533
Here's one idea.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.502
So Joe does have the idol.

16:42.535 --> 16:49.209
And if we were to lose tonight,
like, he'd be super confident

16:49.242 --> 16:50.177
that Mike would go home.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.711
A blindside?

16:51.744 --> 16:52.879
I thought that last night.

16:52.912 --> 16:54.747
Send him home with the idol
in his pocket.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.483
I know, I know.

16:56.516 --> 17:00.120
The idol is unpredictable,
especially in an unpredictable

17:00.153 --> 17:01.921
person's hands and it has a lot
of power.

17:01.954 --> 17:05.992
And I don't want that power
being thrown around without my

17:06.025 --> 17:07.359
say in it.

17:07.394 --> 17:08.828
I want to tell you something
real quick.

17:08.861 --> 17:13.300
Joe has the idol.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.835
>Yeah.

17:15.867 --> 17:16.769
Okay.

17:16.803 --> 17:19.672
Cole just word vomits that
Joe has idol.

17:19.705 --> 17:23.276
And I was like, what are you
doing?

17:23.310 --> 17:25.412
Like, it's too soon.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.714
I'm like, why are you sharing
that information.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.416
We found it together.

17:29.449 --> 17:33.386
And so, we could potentially, if
we want to get rid of that

17:33.420 --> 17:37.957
threat, if we lose tonight, we
could split votes between Joe

17:37.990 --> 17:39.126
and Mike.

17:39.159 --> 17:42.362
I think that he needed to
wait to see what happens after

17:42.395 --> 17:44.331
the challenge and talk to me
again.

17:44.364 --> 17:47.567
And we decide is it what we want
to do.

17:47.600 --> 17:48.368
Cool.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.103
If we get rid of Mike this
time.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.271
Yes.

17:51.304 --> 17:55.742
And then Joe's still left
with the idol, we can't... he's

17:55.775 --> 17:59.879
going to be a lot more
suspicious that he might be on

17:59.912 --> 18:01.080
the chopping block.

18:01.114 --> 18:04.751
Joe is an amazing blindside
candidate because he is locked

18:04.784 --> 18:05.952
in on Mike.

18:05.985 --> 18:13.826
So I am full buy-in into the Joe
blindside enjoy your idol a

18:13.860 --> 18:14.894
sufnear plan.

18:14.927 --> 18:18.131
We're thinking Joe over Mike
tonight potentially.

18:18.165 --> 18:19.866
He's not a strong swimmer.

18:19.899 --> 18:23.303
He will not be super good at
puzzles.

18:23.336 --> 18:24.471
And he complains a lot.

18:24.504 --> 18:27.707
Right now would be the best
time to take him out because

18:27.740 --> 18:29.276
Mike knows he's on the bottom.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.511
He's already told me that.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.246
He'll go wherever I want him to
go.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.749
I like the thought process,
Cole.

18:36.783 --> 18:37.850
Yeah, yeah.

18:37.884 --> 18:40.187
I'm ticked off at Cole for
just running his mouth.

18:40.220 --> 18:44.191
He lost a lot of power with me
by telling roark and Desi, and

18:44.224 --> 18:48.828
the last thing we want is for
Joe to find out that we know

18:48.861 --> 18:51.631
because he could play his idol,
and then any of our heads would

18:51.664 --> 18:54.467
be on the chopping block,
probably Cole's first.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.503
So right now, him wanting to
blindside Joe I am not sure is

19:20.159 --> 19:26.433
Jeff: Come on in, guys!

19:30.303 --> 19:33.706
Jeff: Heroes and healers
getting your first look at the

19:33.740 --> 19:34.641
new hustler tribe.

19:34.674 --> 19:40.313
Simone voted out at the last
tribal council.

19:40.347 --> 19:43.182
All right, you guys ready to get
to today's immunity challenge?

19:43.216 --> 19:43.516
Yeah.

19:43.550 --> 19:44.584
Yeah!

19:44.617 --> 19:47.520
Jeff: First things first,
take back the idols.

19:47.554 --> 19:52.359
Thank you, thank you.

19:52.392 --> 19:56.195
Once gae, immunity is back up
for grabs.

19:56.229 --> 19:58.665
In today's challenge, you're
going to race through a series

19:58.698 --> 20:00.667
of obstacles.

20:00.700 --> 20:05.004
You'll then use sandbags to
knock blocks off a ledge.

20:05.037 --> 20:11.411
You must then stack those blocks
one on top of the other.

20:11.444 --> 20:14.514
First two tribes to finish win
immunity, safe from the vote.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.683
In addition, we're playing for
reward.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.217
Want to know what you're playing
for?

20:18.251 --> 20:19.552
Yeah!

20:19.586 --> 20:20.653
Yes, sir!

20:20.687 --> 20:24.724
Jeff: First tribe to
finish:

20:24.757 --> 20:28.027
Oh!

20:28.060 --> 20:29.529
Jeff: Four chickens!

20:29.562 --> 20:31.798
Oh, my god!

20:31.831 --> 20:33.866
Jeff: One rooster, three
hens.

20:33.900 --> 20:37.069
Second tribe to finish:
Beautiful!

20:37.103 --> 20:38.237
Oh!

20:38.271 --> 20:44.243
Jeff: A dozen eggs courtesy
of the first-place chickens.

20:44.277 --> 20:46.646
Last tribe to finish, nothing
but a date with me at tribal

20:46.679 --> 20:49.516
council where somebody will be
the third person voted out of

20:49.549 --> 20:50.750
this game.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.619
Healers, you have one extra
person.

20:52.652 --> 20:53.853
You have to sit somebody out.

20:53.886 --> 20:54.521
Who is it going to be?

20:54.554 --> 20:55.488
Mike.

20:55.522 --> 20:57.924
Jeff: Mike going to sit out
for the healers.

20:57.957 --> 21:01.260
Mike, take a spot on the
everyone.

21:01.294 --> 21:06.132
Everybody else give you a chance
to strategize and get it on.

21:06.165 --> 21:07.434
All right, here we go.

21:07.467 --> 21:12.672
For immunity and reward,
survivors ready?

21:12.705 --> 21:18.411
Go!

21:18.445 --> 21:23.082
Under and over, under and over!

21:23.115 --> 21:24.617
That's it!

21:24.651 --> 21:27.787
Everybody doing great out of the
gate!

21:27.820 --> 21:30.657
Gotta get everybody to the mat
before you can start working on

21:30.690 --> 21:31.591
this next phase.

21:31.624 --> 21:32.925
Go, heroes!

21:32.959 --> 21:34.293
Go, healers!

21:34.327 --> 21:35.294
Go, hustlers!

21:35.328 --> 21:38.331
Now you have to get everybody
over.

21:38.365 --> 21:44.337
Ashley up first, Cole up first
help healers pushing Lauren up

21:44.371 --> 21:45.438
first.

21:45.472 --> 21:48.007
There goes desdezy for the
healers and Patrick for the

21:48.040 --> 21:48.708
hustlers.

21:48.741 --> 21:49.709
They're now going to pull up jp.

21:49.742 --> 21:52.078
And that leaves Alan as the last
for the heroes.

21:52.111 --> 21:53.112
That's a leap right there.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.748
The heros are up and over
quickly!

21:55.782 --> 21:59.686
Let's go, let's go!

21:59.719 --> 22:02.955
Jeff: It is work, the last
healer.

22:02.989 --> 22:08.828
And here goes the last hustler!

22:08.861 --> 22:12.064
Go!

22:12.098 --> 22:14.967
It is Ben tossing sandbags for
the heros.

22:15.001 --> 22:17.269
It's Cole for the healers.

22:17.303 --> 22:18.738
Chuck them, pat!

22:18.771 --> 22:20.873
Jeff: And Patrick for the
hustlers.

22:20.907 --> 22:23.009
We've got a challenge going
here!

22:23.042 --> 22:24.777
Day eight on "survivor."

22:24.811 --> 22:26.746
Right in the middle.

22:26.779 --> 22:28.280
Jeff: Ben with a nice hit.

22:28.314 --> 22:30.383
Way to end it, good job.

22:30.417 --> 22:32.485
Jeff: Jp coming in for Ben.

22:32.519 --> 22:33.686
Patrick with a nice hit!

22:33.720 --> 22:34.587
Nice.

22:34.621 --> 22:36.423
Jeff: Cole with another big
hit!

22:36.456 --> 22:37.824
You're doing awesome!

22:37.857 --> 22:39.926
Jeff: Jp with another nice
hit.

22:39.959 --> 22:40.860
Another big hit by Cole.

22:40.893 --> 22:42.328
There you go.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.564
Jeff: Heroes down to four
blocks left.

22:44.597 --> 22:45.398
Good job, pat.

22:45.432 --> 22:46.866
Hustlers down to seven.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.668
Keep it going, baby!

22:48.701 --> 22:50.336
Jeff: Jp with a nice hit.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.471
He's down to two!

22:51.504 --> 22:53.072
You want to switch out?

22:53.105 --> 22:54.206
Yeah.

22:54.240 --> 22:56.308
Jeff: Joe now throwing for
the healers.

22:56.342 --> 22:57.577
You want to switch?

22:57.610 --> 22:58.277
Don't get tired.

22:58.310 --> 22:59.612
Pat, can I attack a turn?

22:59.646 --> 23:01.714
Sure.

23:01.748 --> 23:03.182
There you go.

23:03.215 --> 23:06.686
Jeff: Patrick still going
for the hustlers.

23:06.719 --> 23:11.724
Jp down to one block left!

23:11.758 --> 23:14.694
There's one for Joe for the
healers.

23:14.727 --> 23:18.498
Patrick with another hit for the
hustlers.

23:18.531 --> 23:19.732
Heroes have one block left.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.501
Just misses!

23:21.534 --> 23:24.737
Joe with another hit for the
healers.

23:24.771 --> 23:25.538
They're down to two!

23:25.572 --> 23:28.140
The hustlers down to two!

23:28.174 --> 23:29.542
One more!

23:29.576 --> 23:31.844
Jeff: Healers down to one
now.

23:31.878 --> 23:32.612
There it is!

23:32.645 --> 23:34.514
Go, healers!

23:34.547 --> 23:38.184
Start getting all your blocks
over before you stack.

23:38.217 --> 23:41.454
Jp hits the last block for the
heroes.

23:41.488 --> 23:43.556
Gather your blocks!

23:43.590 --> 23:45.224
Pat, do you want to switch?

23:45.257 --> 23:48.027
Jeff: It is now the
hustlers, last group to get

23:48.060 --> 23:49.028
through this.

23:49.061 --> 23:49.796
Patrick has one left now.

23:49.829 --> 23:50.663
Here we go.

23:50.697 --> 23:53.265
Big ones first, big ones
first.

23:53.299 --> 23:54.934
Pat, do you need to switch?

23:54.967 --> 23:57.470
Jeff: Patrick still firing
for the hustlers.

23:57.504 --> 23:59.906
He's get sewing tired.

23:59.939 --> 24:04.110
Jeff: While the healers and
heroes start stacking.

24:04.143 --> 24:06.713
You can put them in any order
you want.

24:06.746 --> 24:08.447
It just has to be one on top of
the other.

24:08.481 --> 24:10.583
Are you ready to swap?

24:10.617 --> 24:12.418
We can swap if you want, pat.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.520
Pat park.

24:13.553 --> 24:16.723
Jeff: Patrick still the
only person to throw for the

24:16.756 --> 24:17.624
hustlers.

24:17.657 --> 24:19.025
If you want to switch, you
can switch.

24:19.058 --> 24:20.026
Jeff: There it is!

24:20.059 --> 24:21.160
Go, hustlers!

24:21.193 --> 24:24.931
Got to gather all your blocks
before you start stacking.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.433
I can't get it up.

24:27.466 --> 24:28.400
Here, two at a time.

24:28.434 --> 24:29.902
I need to be higher.

24:29.936 --> 24:33.172
Jeff: This is reminiscent
of the first challenge when you

24:33.205 --> 24:36.375
had to stand on each others'
shoulders.

24:36.408 --> 24:37.076
Hold my leg!

24:37.109 --> 24:39.045
Healers doing a nice job.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.079
Healers working very quickly.

24:40.112 --> 24:43.516
Hold my legs!

24:43.550 --> 24:46.485
Jeff: Hustlers still racing
to catch up.

24:46.519 --> 24:49.589
Chrissy is up on the shoulders
of the heroes.

24:49.622 --> 24:50.990
Jessica up on the shoulders of
the healers.

24:51.023 --> 24:53.492
This is the last one!

24:53.526 --> 24:54.460
We're winning.

24:54.493 --> 24:55.962
Jeff: Healers have not lost
a challenge yet.

24:55.995 --> 24:58.164
They think they have it!

24:58.197 --> 24:59.732
Something is not right, no.

24:59.766 --> 25:00.700
What's not right?

25:00.733 --> 25:03.703
Are we missing a block?

25:03.736 --> 25:06.606
Jeff: This opens the door
for the hustlers and the heroes.

25:06.639 --> 25:09.742
What's not...
block, block, block.

25:09.776 --> 25:10.777
Oh, my god!

25:10.810 --> 25:13.980
Jeff: The healers did not
have all their blocks!

25:14.013 --> 25:14.847
Huge mistake by the healers.

25:14.881 --> 25:16.515
Get down!

25:16.549 --> 25:20.186
Joe, give it to me!

25:20.219 --> 25:21.520
Jeff: Heroes got it!

25:21.554 --> 25:25.157
Get back to your mat.

25:25.191 --> 25:30.830
3, 2, 1, heroes win immunity and
reward!

25:30.863 --> 25:33.032
Jessica now back up for the
healers.

25:33.065 --> 25:35.501
Hustlers struggling to get Ryan
up.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.036
Let me down!

25:37.069 --> 25:38.237
Just drop me!

25:38.270 --> 25:39.639
It's okay.

25:39.672 --> 25:40.907
It's okay.

25:40.940 --> 25:45.011
Jeff: Healers win immunity
and reward, sending the hustler

25:45.044 --> 25:49.716
tribe to tribal council again.

25:49.749 --> 25:51.217
Good job.

25:51.250 --> 25:54.486
Oh, my god, that was so
awesome!

25:54.520 --> 25:56.923
Jeff: Here organization
congratulations.

25:56.956 --> 25:57.590
Immunity is yours.

25:57.624 --> 25:58.357
Nobody going home tonight.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.926
Thank you, Jeff.

25:59.959 --> 26:03.562
Jeff: Healers, once again,
safe from tribal council.

26:03.596 --> 26:08.367
Nobody going home.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.870
Hero tribe, thanks to the
mistake by the healers, nice

26:10.903 --> 26:11.671
reward for you.

26:11.704 --> 26:13.239
Come grab your chickens.

26:13.272 --> 26:14.273
Head back to camp.

26:14.306 --> 26:17.944
Enjoy the night off.

26:17.977 --> 26:20.146
Healers, fortunately, you still
have the eggs.

26:20.179 --> 26:21.013
Come grab them.

26:21.047 --> 26:24.116
Grab your stuff, head back to
camp.

26:24.150 --> 26:30.056
No tribal council tonight.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.223
Patrick, what's the feeling?

26:31.257 --> 26:34.761
We're only eight days in, and,
yet, you're going back to

26:34.794 --> 26:37.229
tribal, gog lose another tribe
member.

26:37.263 --> 26:38.665
You're already down to five.

26:38.698 --> 26:41.367
Is it going to be a bit of a
madhouse?

26:41.400 --> 26:42.669
Yes, Jeff.

26:42.702 --> 26:45.905
We all like each other and we
all get along well, and it's

26:45.938 --> 26:47.707
quite depressing knowing that
we're going back.

26:47.740 --> 26:50.276
But we're going, and we gotta
do it.

26:50.309 --> 26:53.112
Jeff: All right, guys, grab
your stuff, head back to camp.

26:53.145 --> 26:56.716
See you tonight at tribal, where
somebody will be the third

26:56.749 --> 26:58.150
person voted out of this game.

26:58.184 --> 27:01.120
We just lost the challenge,
but Patrick didn't want to stop.

27:01.153 --> 27:02.855
It was like a one-man show.

27:02.889 --> 27:04.891
I've been playing center field
for 25 years.

27:04.924 --> 27:07.026
I can hit a catcher in the
forehead.

27:07.059 --> 27:10.697
And I think everybody's pretty
much over Patrick in the way

27:10.730 --> 27:13.132
this he cost us today, and I
want to make sure that Patrick

27:13.165 --> 27:15.167
is going home.

27:48.667 --> 27:51.137
Hitting all the targets like I
should have been, and I should

27:51.170 --> 27:56.242
have let somebody, possibly, sub
in for me.

27:56.275 --> 27:57.209
Sorry.

27:57.243 --> 28:00.646
You jaent justify it, you
know what I mean?

28:00.679 --> 28:02.849
I should have been better.

28:02.882 --> 28:04.416
Lauren's not happy with me.

28:04.450 --> 28:07.019
But by looking at her, I don't
think that her coming in for me

28:07.053 --> 28:11.791
would have really changed much.

28:11.824 --> 28:13.659
I'm sorry, guys.

28:13.692 --> 28:14.660
Don't be sorry.

28:14.693 --> 28:15.627
Yeah.

28:15.661 --> 28:16.462
We're all good.

28:16.495 --> 28:18.798
I know you tried your
hardest, man.

28:18.831 --> 28:19.631
That's all that matters.

28:19.665 --> 28:22.802
That's all that matters.

28:22.835 --> 28:29.575
I'm gonna rinse off.

28:29.608 --> 28:32.344
Well, guys, what's...
we're good.

28:32.378 --> 28:33.780
She wants you out.

28:33.813 --> 28:34.847
We're getting her out.

28:34.881 --> 28:37.383
That's all there is to it.

28:37.416 --> 28:39.151
I mean, she has said him?

28:39.185 --> 28:41.087
I think she assumes.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.188
That's great.

28:42.221 --> 28:43.990
Why is it great?

28:44.023 --> 28:46.392
I'm being very sarcastic.

28:46.425 --> 28:47.326
Don't even worry.

28:47.359 --> 28:49.829
So tonight, I've got the guys
on my side.

28:49.862 --> 28:52.999
I've got Ali on my side, and I'm
comfortable knowing Lauren's

28:53.032 --> 28:54.133
going home.

28:54.166 --> 28:57.636
But I don't want her going
around worrying, so I'm trying

28:57.669 --> 29:03.042
to, you know, make sure I
continue to have her part of my

29:03.075 --> 29:06.678
conversation and, you know,
making her enjoy herself here.

29:06.712 --> 29:07.579
You good?

29:07.613 --> 29:11.217
I'm as good as I can get, I
guess.

29:11.250 --> 29:13.419
How about you?

29:13.452 --> 29:15.721
I feel terrible.

29:15.754 --> 29:16.555
Feel terrible?

29:16.588 --> 29:20.026
Yeah.

29:20.059 --> 29:21.760
Freaking couldn't knock any of
those freaking blocks down.

29:21.794 --> 29:24.797
Well, we kept saying we'd
switch out with you.

29:24.831 --> 29:28.667
We kept saying, we could tell
you were tired, and I played

29:28.700 --> 29:31.070
outfield for 25 years.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.906
Me and Ali kept saying that.

29:33.940 --> 29:35.842
But you acted like we weren't
even there.

29:35.875 --> 29:38.744
It was like a one-man team there
for a little while.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.747
To lose today it, just in
general, I'm bummed out about

29:41.780 --> 29:43.449
it, but Patrick wouldn't quit.

29:43.482 --> 29:44.984
And it really did cost us.

29:45.017 --> 29:49.455
I would much rather lose as a
team than one person lose for

29:49.488 --> 29:50.656
everybody.

29:50.689 --> 29:52.391
I'm assuming you all are going
to try to vote me out tonight.

29:52.424 --> 29:55.261
I don't know if that's right.

29:55.294 --> 30:00.132
If it's not me, who else is
is it if you have somebody else

30:00.166 --> 30:01.267
in mind?

30:01.300 --> 30:04.170
Because I can look at you and
tell you have me in mind.

30:04.203 --> 30:06.138
Yeah, but...
yeah but what?

30:06.172 --> 30:07.106
I don't want to go home.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.708
Redheads don't do very well
at lying.

30:09.741 --> 30:13.980
So you costing us the win cost
vote meeg out today.

30:14.013 --> 30:16.582
That makes no sense whatsoever.

30:16.615 --> 30:20.887
All he could do is grin, so I
know for a fact that Patrick

30:20.920 --> 30:22.121
will write my name down.

30:22.154 --> 30:25.892
You know, to be a good fisherman
do I sit here in the same spot

30:25.925 --> 30:29.228
every day and wait for the fish
to come by?

30:29.261 --> 30:30.429
No.

30:30.462 --> 30:32.564
I try numerous different things
and I never threw my handsut

30:32.598 --> 30:35.034
without trying my hardest.

30:35.067 --> 30:38.404
What upset me at the end is
the way he was grinning at me,

30:38.437 --> 30:39.538
like it was funny.

30:39.571 --> 30:43.475
If he had... he would have
realized, it would have been

30:43.509 --> 30:44.243
more on the team than him.

30:44.276 --> 30:45.344
Exactly.

30:45.377 --> 30:46.012
It wouldn't have been a
Patrick loss, it would have

30:46.045 --> 30:47.880
been, "at least we all tried."

30:47.914 --> 30:51.117
Patrick being the competitive
person that he is, he was

30:51.150 --> 30:53.285
supposed to be one strong in
challenges.

30:53.319 --> 30:56.122
But again, when it came down to
it, we didn't win.

30:56.155 --> 30:59.825
And it's kind of like a
repetition for us.

30:59.858 --> 31:02.962
So I need to figure out if
Patrick being around is really

31:02.995 --> 31:04.830
an advantage anymore.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.833
I mean, don't take this
offensively, but you're the

31:07.866 --> 31:08.234
oddball.

31:08.267 --> 31:08.834
Yeah, yeah.

31:08.867 --> 31:09.701
And I'm the old woman.

31:09.735 --> 31:12.038
Now that Simone is gone...
exactly.

31:12.071 --> 31:15.908
And I trust Ali and I trust
Devon but I don't trust...

31:15.942 --> 31:17.876
pat, yeah.

31:17.910 --> 31:22.848
He's a wild card.

31:22.881 --> 31:26.618
Lauren just came up to me and
she's just like, "it's going to

31:26.652 --> 31:27.519
be Patrick."

31:27.553 --> 31:28.687
Okay.

31:28.720 --> 31:32.391
She's like, "you're the
oddball, and, like, I'm the old

31:32.424 --> 31:33.859
lady, so... I was like uh...

31:33.892 --> 31:37.863
What matters is we have...
fu for sure.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.098
Everybody coming to us.

31:39.131 --> 31:43.369
Devon and I are in position
where we can sort of dictate the

31:43.402 --> 31:44.436
vote.

31:44.470 --> 31:46.838
The options now are vote off
Lauren or vote off pat.

31:46.872 --> 31:51.210
What do you joong this is
unequivocally a big decision for

31:51.243 --> 31:52.078
me.

31:52.111 --> 31:54.846
And I don't know exactly what to
do yet.

31:54.880 --> 32:00.019
Pat's just...
I want to save pat.

32:00.052 --> 32:01.620
We get rid of Lauren tonight.

32:01.653 --> 32:04.590
And we can do the boys to the
merge.

32:04.623 --> 32:05.291
What do you want to do?

32:05.324 --> 32:06.758
Pat and Lauren hate each other.

32:06.792 --> 32:12.064
Yeah, but I'd rather... i
think I'd rather go to the merge

32:12.098 --> 32:13.032
with Lauren than with pat.

32:13.065 --> 32:15.034
We don't know if we'll get to
the merge.

32:15.067 --> 32:16.702
I'm going back and forth.

32:16.735 --> 32:19.405
Pat stepped up at the
challenge, but if you're going

32:19.438 --> 32:23.742
to step up, you better be able
to handle what you step up for.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.411
It was just pat choking.

32:25.444 --> 32:28.314
And I do think we lost because
of that.

32:28.347 --> 32:29.982
Lauren, on the other hand, she's
very steady.

32:30.016 --> 32:32.218
I trust her.

32:32.251 --> 32:35.087
But, she doesn't really fit in
with the other tribe members,

32:35.121 --> 32:40.692
and if we keep Lauren around,
we're more likely to lose the

32:40.726 --> 32:44.963
next immunity challenge, and
we've already lost two in a row.

32:44.997 --> 32:48.234
I could be a hot head, but at
the same time, I know when to

32:48.267 --> 32:50.369
turn it into I know when it to
turn it off.

32:50.402 --> 32:54.940
I feel like I've done everything
I can do.

32:54.973 --> 32:58.944
Obviously, I'm a hustler for a
reason.

32:58.977 --> 33:02.881
So if it is me going home
tonight, I will promise you, I'm

33:02.914 --> 33:12.958
not going to go home without a
fight.

33:12.958 --> 33:24.236
Not going to go home without a
fight.

33:24.270 --> 33:25.971
Jeff: All right, so Lauren,
eight days in.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.974
You've lost two out of three
immunity challenges.

33:29.007 --> 33:32.378
At what point do you guys stop
talking about how well you get

33:32.411 --> 33:35.514
along and start owning the fact
that it just isn't working right

33:35.547 --> 33:36.815
now with this group?

33:36.848 --> 33:38.084
Today.

33:38.117 --> 33:41.220
I mean, that challenge should
have been a win for us.

33:41.253 --> 33:44.590
But one of us kind of took it to
their own level and tried to

33:44.623 --> 33:46.225
complete it by themselves.

33:46.258 --> 33:49.261
Jeff: Patrick, she can only
be talking about you and the

33:49.295 --> 33:49.728
sandbags, right?

33:49.761 --> 33:50.696
Yes, sir, I am.

33:50.729 --> 33:52.631
Definitely talking about me,
Jeff.

33:52.664 --> 33:56.702
I can see where she's concerned
with me not winning that, and

33:56.735 --> 33:59.238
there is a point where it could
be my fault.

33:59.271 --> 34:02.141
I should not have taken the
entire time for myself.

34:02.174 --> 34:03.409
I agree.

34:03.442 --> 34:05.944
I mean I was going to finish the
sentence, but he finished it for

34:05.977 --> 34:06.912
me.

34:06.945 --> 34:08.013
He shouldn't have took the whole
time himself.

34:08.045 --> 34:11.283
I mean, I played outfield,
center field for probably 25

34:11.317 --> 34:12.484
years.

34:12.518 --> 34:13.784
You have to realize that it's
not a one-man show sometimes.

34:13.819 --> 34:17.289
We have to lose together and we
need to win together.

34:17.322 --> 34:19.658
And today, we didn't lose
together.

34:19.690 --> 34:20.891
It's an adrenaline rush.

34:20.926 --> 34:23.695
I understand that, son, but
you know when you went up there,

34:23.728 --> 34:25.431
there was five of us.

34:25.464 --> 34:29.034
And then there wasn't
mysteriously just one person

34:29.067 --> 34:29.534
left.

34:29.568 --> 34:30.101
We didn't disappear.

34:30.136 --> 34:31.437
I totally understand.

34:31.469 --> 34:33.972
Jeff: Ali what was your
take on the challenge?

34:34.005 --> 34:38.377
Patrick did call an executive
decision and say, "I'm staying

34:38.409 --> 34:39.545
in."

34:39.578 --> 34:40.911
Yon if that should have to do
with anything about us being

34:40.946 --> 34:42.148
here.

34:42.181 --> 34:44.716
Who knows if we had switched we
could have tooken even longer?

34:44.750 --> 34:47.985
For me I don't like to dwell on
things from the past and we need

34:48.018 --> 34:49.087
to look further from here.

34:49.121 --> 34:51.790
Jeff: Patrick, does that
give you a little sense of

34:51.822 --> 34:55.661
comfort that you're not going to
be judged on one element for one

34:55.694 --> 34:56.027
challenge?

34:56.061 --> 34:57.229
For sure.

34:57.263 --> 34:59.331
Jeff, I tried my best, and it
definitely gives me a sense of

34:59.365 --> 35:02.401
comfort in knowing I'm not going
to be held totally accountable.

35:02.434 --> 35:03.802
I wanted those chickens.

35:03.835 --> 35:04.703
They looked so good.

35:04.736 --> 35:07.005
Jeff: Lauren, you had your
hand raised.

35:07.038 --> 35:10.108
Like I said, we still have to
play as a team, and today just

35:10.142 --> 35:12.444
showed that Patrick is not
exactly a team player.

35:12.478 --> 35:14.346
I mean, he's a good idol hunter.

35:14.380 --> 35:15.147
That's all he does.

35:15.181 --> 35:17.082
Ey admitted, "I'm constantly
looking.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.250
I'm constantly looking."

35:18.284 --> 35:21.187
It keeps you on edge knowing
that someone is trying to play

35:21.220 --> 35:25.090
strategy and worried mus enough
they need to cover their back.

35:25.123 --> 35:28.560
I don't think I've looked for
the idol yet, but if he's

35:28.594 --> 35:30.862
hunting, maybe we should all go
hunting.

35:30.896 --> 35:33.098
Jeff: Patrick, you had a
big reaction to Lauren saying

35:33.131 --> 35:34.566
she hasn't looked yet.

35:34.600 --> 35:38.670
I'm worried that Lauren has
an idol, and her saying she

35:38.704 --> 35:40.239
hasn't looked was a big relief.

35:40.272 --> 35:45.110
I have two of them.

35:45.143 --> 35:50.115
I had a quick conversation
with Lauren and said, "who are

35:50.148 --> 35:51.517
and and I didn't give her an
answer.

35:51.550 --> 35:52.751
Let's say what you really
said.

35:52.784 --> 35:57.523
You approached me with a smile
which is very obvious and I

35:57.556 --> 36:00.125
said, "obviously, you're voting
for me tonight."

36:00.158 --> 36:03.128
And he sat there and grinned and
I said you're trying to comfort

36:03.161 --> 36:08.133
me when I never believed a
redhead a day in my life.

36:08.166 --> 36:11.603
Jeff, I will say, tonight, one
of us is going to be blindsided.

36:11.637 --> 36:12.704
I can say that.

36:12.738 --> 36:16.141
You're right, somebody will
be blindsided for sure.

36:16.174 --> 36:19.978
Jeff: Ryan, it's kind of
like you're in a relationship...

36:20.011 --> 36:23.148
I've never been in a
relationship.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.149
Jeff: Okay.

36:24.182 --> 36:26.084
You know somebody?

36:26.117 --> 36:27.253
( Laughter ).

36:27.286 --> 36:28.220
Jeff: Well, I was just
going to say, it's kind of like

36:28.254 --> 36:31.623
if you're in a relationship and
guto therapy.

36:31.657 --> 36:34.460
The first thing the therapist
will say is let's just talk.

36:34.493 --> 36:35.461
Yeah.

36:35.494 --> 36:36.695
Jeff: Get it out, and
things will get better.

36:36.728 --> 36:39.064
Can you feel that, the tribe is
airing to get movement going?

36:39.097 --> 36:42.434
I do feel that way because I
think every member of the group

36:42.468 --> 36:45.103
is thinking yeah, this is a
happy group and I'm contributing

36:45.136 --> 36:47.172
to that happy group.

36:47.205 --> 36:50.409
But it's not a happy group, and
we're not a successful group at

36:50.442 --> 36:51.510
that.

36:51.543 --> 36:54.179
So somebody is influencing the
group in a negative way.

36:54.212 --> 36:57.416
Jeff: Devon, is it possible
that part of the problem of this

36:57.449 --> 37:00.185
group is just chemistry?

37:00.218 --> 37:01.387
Yeah.

37:01.420 --> 37:05.624
My vote tonight is, you know,
headed in that direction, what

37:05.657 --> 37:09.194
is going to get that chemistry
going again, so that we can win

37:09.227 --> 37:11.530
I think my vote is going to
be for the same reason.

37:11.563 --> 37:12.331
Jeff: Chemistry.

37:12.364 --> 37:14.500
Chemistry, to keep us
rolling.

37:14.533 --> 37:16.001
It ain't necessarily what was
done.

37:16.034 --> 37:19.204
It's how to make it better.

37:19.237 --> 37:22.974
But, also, for whenever the
merge comes, we need to be best

37:23.008 --> 37:27.446
suited going forward to socially
discern which group can we fit

37:27.479 --> 37:28.647
into.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.916
Because strategically, what the
heck are we going to present

37:30.949 --> 37:32.083
stroojically to them?

37:32.117 --> 37:33.218
Are we going to show them how to
do challenges after that?

37:33.251 --> 37:34.386
That's just not going to happen.

37:34.420 --> 37:37.289
Jeff: Patrick, do you feel
that pressure, too, that if

37:37.323 --> 37:39.891
there's a merge coming, man,
what are we going to do?

37:39.925 --> 37:41.126
For sure.

37:41.159 --> 37:44.463
We're already fewer numbers than
the other tribes so how can we

37:44.496 --> 37:45.997
work together to gain numbers?

37:46.031 --> 37:47.098
Who can talk the best?

37:47.132 --> 37:49.568
Who can make friends the
easiest?

37:49.601 --> 37:51.337
And I think that's something I
can offer.

37:51.370 --> 37:56.408
I can make people feel loved and
comforted and that's part of

37:56.442 --> 37:57.609
making friends and getting an
alliance.

37:57.643 --> 38:00.145
Jeff: Ali, that's a really
honest statement from Patrick.

38:00.178 --> 38:01.513
I guess that's his opinion.

38:01.547 --> 38:04.883
He may think he gets along with
people but why can't you get

38:04.916 --> 38:07.786
along with Lauren and we've been
together for eight days.

38:07.819 --> 38:10.922
How easy is it going to be for
him with people who have clicked

38:10.956 --> 38:14.192
eight, 10, 15 days and we have
to try to squeeze ourselves in

38:14.225 --> 38:16.261
there.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.229
Jeff: Patrick, you have a
smile on your face.

38:18.263 --> 38:20.699
Is that because something is
happening for this tribe, even

38:20.732 --> 38:25.270
though we're at the worst place
you can be, tribal council?

38:25.303 --> 38:27.973
You know, Jeff, I always
welcome criticism because, you

38:28.006 --> 38:29.675
know, I'm not a perfect person.

38:29.708 --> 38:34.513
I know I have... I have
difficulties in... in growing,

38:34.546 --> 38:35.681
like everyone else.

38:35.714 --> 38:38.249
Hearing Ali tell me that I'm not
necessarily a good social

38:38.283 --> 38:39.485
player.

38:39.518 --> 38:41.052
And hearing Lauren tell me that
I'm not listening to the team

38:41.086 --> 38:43.555
while we're going through
challenges, you know, it is a

38:43.589 --> 38:45.290
wake-up call to me.

38:45.323 --> 38:48.894
Jeff: So, Patrick, you just
took two lethal criticisms from

38:48.927 --> 38:51.463
two different people and you're
saying, "I welcome it.

38:51.497 --> 38:52.163
I'm learning."

38:52.197 --> 38:53.365
Right.

38:53.399 --> 38:56.468
And, you know, I want to grow
from all this.

38:56.502 --> 38:59.905
Jeff: Ryan, is it too big
of a stretch to say that moments

38:59.938 --> 39:05.243
like that between Ali and lawren
and Patrick can actually flip a

39:05.276 --> 39:06.378
tribe?

39:06.412 --> 39:08.947
You know, tribal council is...
Is very... it has so much

39:08.980 --> 39:10.215
momentum, right?

39:10.248 --> 39:12.083
And you can gain so much because
you just come together and say,

39:12.117 --> 39:13.284
"this is the group.

39:13.318 --> 39:16.888
This is the moment that we're
going to shine up this crappy

39:16.922 --> 39:19.324
little tricycle and try to sell
it to these other tribes who

39:19.357 --> 39:21.359
now, we're not going to be used
as pawns.

39:21.393 --> 39:22.894
That's not what we're saying at
all.

39:22.928 --> 39:27.766
We also understand we're not
comincoming in as the c.E.O.S.

39:27.799 --> 39:28.467
We may be month the floors at
first.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.335
Which is why we're hustlers.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.169
Exactly.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.070
I'm not giving up.

39:32.103 --> 39:33.304
Nobody here is giving up.

39:33.338 --> 39:36.041
And we are the only tribe that
is going to have real unity and

39:36.074 --> 39:43.348
that is something unique about
us and they don't have that.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.484
Jeff: All right, it is time
to vote.

39:45.517 --> 39:51.557
Lauren, you're up.

39:58.396 --> 40:01.467
You're aggravating!

40:04.302 --> 40:06.137
I'm sorry, Lauren.

40:06.171 --> 40:09.441
You had to go.

40:25.056 --> 40:34.900
Jeff: I'll go tally the
votes.

40:34.933 --> 40:38.470
If anybody has a hidden immunity
idol and you want to play it,

40:38.504 --> 40:42.874
now would be the time to do so.

40:44.109 --> 40:46.778
Okay, once the votes are read,
the decision is final.

40:46.812 --> 40:49.615
Person voted out will be asked
to leave the tribal council

40:49.648 --> 40:50.115
immediately.

40:50.148 --> 40:53.218
I'll read the votes.

40:53.251 --> 40:59.390
First vote, Patrick.

40:59.424 --> 41:00.158
Lauren.

41:00.191 --> 41:05.731
One vote Patrick, one vote
Lauren.

41:05.764 --> 41:06.632
Patrick.

41:06.665 --> 41:10.201
That's two votes Patrick, one
vote Lauren.

41:10.235 --> 41:12.838
Third person voted out of
"survivor," Patrick.

41:12.871 --> 41:13.471
That's three.

41:13.505 --> 41:14.172
That's enough.

41:14.205 --> 41:20.712
You need to bring me your torch.

41:20.746 --> 41:24.616
Oh!

41:24.650 --> 41:30.789
You guy guys are awful.

41:30.822 --> 41:40.866
Jeff: Patrick, the tribe
has spoken.

41:40.866 --> 41:47.038
Jeff: Patrick, the tribe
has spoken.

41:47.072 --> 41:50.609
Jeff: Well, tribal is the
end for somebody but tonight, it

41:50.642 --> 41:54.179
also appears to be a rebirth for
the rest of the tribe.

41:54.212 --> 41:56.948
Grab your torches, head back to
camp.

41:56.982 --> 41:59.918
Good night.

Jeff: Stay tuned for scenes

42:10.228 --> 42:12.230
from our next episode.

42:16.968 --> 42:19.938
Jeff: Next time on
"survivor": Just when you think

42:19.971 --> 42:20.939
you're on top...
things were well oiled and

42:20.972 --> 42:21.339
greased.

42:21.372 --> 42:22.140
We are moving.

42:22.173 --> 42:24.375
Jeff: The game flips upside
down.

42:24.409 --> 42:25.577
Everybody drop your buffs.

42:25.611 --> 42:26.745
Whoa!

42:26.778 --> 42:28.580
Jeff: We are switching
tribes.

42:28.614 --> 42:29.648
My palms are sweating.

42:29.681 --> 42:31.416
My heart was racing.

42:31.449 --> 42:32.483
Oh!

42:32.517 --> 42:35.721
Everything gets erased and
it's a brand-new game.

42:35.754 --> 42:36.622
Wild.

42:36.655 --> 42:39.257
This is the worst thing I've
ever felt.

42:39.290 --> 42:41.126
I had no idea it was coming.

42:41.159 --> 42:43.328
I it total trust with Ryan,
Devon, and Ali.

42:43.361 --> 42:47.599
I hope you guys don't have a
very successful game because

42:47.633 --> 42:51.236
you're liars and it really hurts
me that you would not keep your

42:51.269 --> 42:52.437
word.

42:52.470 --> 42:54.840
It's too early in the game for
me to leave and this has been

42:54.873 --> 42:55.140
devastating.
