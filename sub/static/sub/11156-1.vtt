12:38.691 --> 12:40.493
I HOPE YOU GOT IT,

12:40.493 --> 12:44.697
BECAUSE I JUST WENT
THROUGH TWO YEARS
OF LOST AND FOUND.

12:44.697 --> 12:46.699
YOU DIDN'T GET IT?

12:46.699 --> 12:47.935
OOH. AH!

12:47.935 --> 12:51.171
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET YOU
TO THE INFIRMARY.

12:53.340 --> 12:54.141
PERFECT.

12:54.141 --> 12:57.477
THE GLAZE
IS ALMOST PERFECT.

12:57.477 --> 12:58.846
THERE'S NO POINT.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.247
I'M CALLING
THE UNIVERSITY COPS.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.715
LET'S NEGOTIATE.
HOW MUCH CASH
DO WE HAVE?

13:02.715 --> 13:03.851
CAN'T EAT MONEY.

13:03.851 --> 13:05.352
DOESN'T MONEY BUY FOOD?

13:05.352 --> 13:06.186
HELGA...

13:06.186 --> 13:07.787
YOU'RE BRILLIANT.
I LOVE YOU.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.289
HE'S PROBABLY
SCHIZOPHRENIC.

13:09.289 --> 13:12.425
MOST OF THE HOMELESS
ARE SCHIZOPHRENICS
OFF MEDICATION.

13:12.425 --> 13:13.726
I HAVE 50 ON ME.

13:13.726 --> 13:16.129
I NEED THE MONEY
TO FIX THE COMPUTER.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.131
IF I CONVINCE
MY ESTEEMED FATHER

13:18.131 --> 13:20.133
THAT THE MONEY
ISN'T FOR ME, MAYBE--

13:20.133 --> 13:21.601
EVERETT,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

13:21.601 --> 13:25.105
THIS GUY COULD BE
USING MY THESIS
FOR TOILET PAPER.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.107
HE COULD BE EATING IT.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.909
HE HAS NO RESPECT
FOR HIMSELF,

13:28.909 --> 13:31.278
MUCH LESS FOR WHAT
I'M STRUGGLING TO DO.

13:31.278 --> 13:34.281
HE LIKED TORMENTING ME.
HE WANTS ME TO FAIL.

13:34.281 --> 13:36.383
PITKANNAN ADVISED
BILL RAPP LAST YEAR.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.285
HE DROPPED HIM
JUST BEFORE DEADLINE

13:38.285 --> 13:40.520
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T
HAVE A ROUGH DRAFT.

13:40.520 --> 13:41.354
OH, GOD.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.290
YOU NEED REST.
GET SOME SLEEP.

13:43.290 --> 13:45.292
WE'LL GET A FRESH
DOUGHNUT TOMORROW.

13:45.292 --> 13:48.495
I'M SURE HE DOESN'T
WANT YOU TO FAIL.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.897
JUST REASON
WITH HIM.

13:49.897 --> 13:52.299
DEAL WITH HIM
LIKE A HUMAN BEING.

13:52.299 --> 13:55.302
I KNOW HE'S A HUMAN BEING.
I SMELLED HIM.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.905
HE'S A WORTHLESS, STINKING,
FILTHY, USELESS HUMAN BEING.

13:57.905 --> 14:01.208
YEAH. HELLO. SECURITY?

14:03.776 --> 14:06.113

14:15.255 --> 14:17.457
HEY, MONTY,
IS THAT HIM?

14:17.457 --> 14:19.226
HE'S A LITTLE OLD MAN.

14:19.226 --> 14:22.229

NOW WHERE IS IT?

14:22.229 --> 14:26.033

STEP FORWARD.

SIMON B. WILDER, JUDGE.

14:47.220 --> 14:51.058
AS A TAXPAYER, I'D LIKE
TO REQUEST A TRIAL BY JURY.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.961
AND WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU PAID TAXES?

14:53.961 --> 14:55.828
THREE TIMES
JUST LAST WEEK.

14:55.828 --> 14:57.364
YOU PAID TAXES THREE TIMES?

14:57.364 --> 14:58.531
YES, SIR.

14:58.531 --> 15:02.102
THERE'S A FEDERAL, STATE,
AND COUNTY TAX ON WINE.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.906
MR. WILDER, THE COURT
CONCEDES THAT YOU HAVE

15:06.906 --> 15:08.308
PAID VARIOUS TAXES.

15:08.308 --> 15:11.378
NEVERTHELESS, A JURY TRIAL
IS NOT CALLED FOR.

STILL STAND.

HOW DO YOU PLEAD?

15:16.716 --> 15:17.985
NOT GUILTY.

15:17.985 --> 15:20.320
YOU WERE FOUND LIVING
IN AN OLD FURNACE ROOM

15:20.320 --> 15:22.922
UNDER WIDENER LIBRARY ON

I'LL DROP THE CHARGE
OF TRESPASSING,

BUT YOUR BREATHALYZER TEST
SHOWED YOU WERE DRUNK

15:34.968 --> 15:36.403
WHEN YOU WERE ARRESTED.

15:36.403 --> 15:39.172
AT MY ARREST,
I WAS NEITHER
DRIVING AN AUTOMOBILE

15:39.172 --> 15:41.374
OR OPERATING
HEAVY FARM EQUIPMENT.

15:41.374 --> 15:43.443
I WAS READING.
I'M PAST
THE DRINKING AGE.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.179
IF I DRINK TO KILL
THE WINTER CHILL,

15:46.179 --> 15:47.680
IT'S NOT A CRIME.

15:47.680 --> 15:51.184
IF IT WERE, EVERY FAN
AT A HARVARD/YALE

FINE. THE BUM

21:40.633 --> 21:42.635
DOES ANYBODY
HAVE A RAZOR?

21:42.635 --> 21:45.271
MY LEGS ARE
TURNING INTO
CHRISTMAS TREES.

COME ON.
WE'RE ALL GUYS HERE.

21:50.109 --> 21:51.243
WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

21:51.243 --> 21:52.645
I GOT A DATE.

21:52.645 --> 21:56.215
PROMISED JONATHAN
I'D MAKE UP
WITH HIM AGAIN.

21:56.215 --> 21:57.784
JONATHAN. THE FACE.

21:57.784 --> 22:00.820
HE'S MORE THAN THAT.
HE'S ALSO A GREAT BODY.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.490
JESUS, COURTNEY.
COULD WE NOT TALK

22:03.490 --> 22:04.791
ABOUT SEX RIGHT NOW?

22:04.791 --> 22:07.394
JEFF, YOU FORGOT TO TAKE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND HOME,

22:07.394 --> 22:08.528
SO I DEFLATED HER.

22:08.528 --> 22:09.896

22:09.896 --> 22:10.797
THANKS.

22:10.797 --> 22:14.000

TIRE OF THE FACE,

22:14.000 --> 22:15.868

GOT A BROTHER.

22:17.904 --> 22:19.506
HOW'S THE VIEW?

22:20.707 --> 22:22.709
THIS ISN'T
GOING TO WORK.

22:22.709 --> 22:25.311
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS
SINCE JUNIOR YEAR.

22:25.311 --> 22:27.313
I'M NOT GOING
TO START AGAIN

22:27.313 --> 22:29.682
BECAUSE SOME BUM
WANTS TO HOLD IT HOSTAGE.

22:29.682 --> 22:32.852
I'LL TALK HIM INTO
GIVING ME THE WHOLE THING.

22:32.852 --> 22:35.388
YOU'VE BEEN GREAT
AT TALKING HIM
INTO THINGS.

22:35.388 --> 22:37.557
YOU SAID
HE WANTS A HOME.

22:37.557 --> 22:39.426
EVERETT,
I'LL HANDLE IT, O.K.?

22:39.426 --> 22:40.493
O.K., JEFF?

22:40.493 --> 22:42.629
I'LL HAVE HIM OUT
IN A FEW DAYS.

22:42.629 --> 22:44.130
CUT ME SOME SLACK.

22:46.633 --> 22:48.468
KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.

22:48.468 --> 22:52.238
MONTY. MONTY.

22:52.238 --> 22:53.506
GO GET HER, MONTY.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.575
GO GET HER!

22:55.575 --> 22:58.244
I THINK WE SHOULD
CALL YOUR MOTHER.

23:03.249 --> 23:05.251
HE'S GOING TO FREEZE
OUT THERE.

23:05.251 --> 23:06.886
GIVE HIM MY EXTRA BLANKETS.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.489
I DON'T WANT HIM
TO BE TOO COMFORTABLE.

23:09.489 --> 23:10.857
HE COULD DIE.

23:10.857 --> 23:11.924
NO SUCH LUCK.

23:11.924 --> 23:14.527
YOU'RE NOT REALLY
LIKE THIS, ARE YOU?

23:14.527 --> 23:17.129
TELL ME THIS HARD-HEARTED
JERK ISN'T YOU.

23:17.129 --> 23:18.230
GIVE UP ON ME.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.499
I'M TIRED OF
DISAPPOINTING YOU.

23:19.499 --> 23:21.267
THEN DO IT FOR YOURSELF.

23:21.267 --> 23:23.970
YOU WANT TO BE
A HOT-SHIT DIPLOMAT.

23:23.970 --> 23:25.371
SECRETARY OF STATE?

23:25.371 --> 23:27.674
EVEN PITKANNAN
WOULD OFFER A HOSTILE POWER

23:27.674 --> 23:29.375
BLANKETS
TO ESTABLISH GOOD WILL.

23:29.375 --> 23:30.877
DON'T CUT YOURSELF.

23:35.281 --> 23:37.684
I NEVER WANTED
TO BE A RAZOR

23:37.684 --> 23:39.886
SO BAD IN MY LIFE.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.400
HERE.

23:54.400 --> 23:55.968
IT'S YOUR NAMESAKE'S WORK.

23:55.968 --> 23:57.970
SOMEBODY SPOTTED YOU
IN THE LIBRARY,

23:57.970 --> 24:01.373
THOUGHT YOU WERE
WALT WHITMAN'S GHOST.

24:01.373 --> 24:02.575
BOO.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.845
VAN'S ACTUALLY MINE,
YOU KNOW.

24:05.845 --> 24:08.447
I LOANED MY EX-ROOMMATE
A SMALL FORTUNE...

24:08.447 --> 24:09.716
AND HE FLED TO BALI.

24:09.716 --> 24:11.584
AND I GOT THE VAN.

24:11.584 --> 24:13.219
WHY DON'T YOU SELL IT?

24:13.219 --> 24:14.453
THE ENGINE DOESN'T RUN.

24:14.453 --> 24:17.490
SO FIX IT. WANT ME
TO DO IT FOR YOU?

24:17.490 --> 24:18.991
ARE YOU A MECHANIC?

24:18.991 --> 24:21.127
I'M A ZEN BUDDHIST.
THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH.

24:21.127 --> 24:24.330
HOW MANY
BOTTLES OF WINE
WOULD YOU GIVE ME

24:24.330 --> 24:26.999
IF I FIXED IT?

THAT'S MY FINAL OFFER.

24:32.204 --> 24:35.374
DIDN'T YOU USE TO RUN
A SAVINGS AND LOAN?

24:35.374 --> 24:37.009
YOU'RE THINKING
OF MY FATHER.

24:37.009 --> 24:40.212
LOOK, YOU WANT
A LITTLE SOMETHING
IN ADVANCE?

24:40.212 --> 24:42.014
BOY, OH, BOY.
YOU MUST BE

24:42.014 --> 24:44.517
ONE OF THE GREAT MINDS
OF YOUR GENERATION.

HERE WE GO.

26:29.188 --> 26:30.589
FOR LODGINGS AND MEALS,

26:30.589 --> 26:32.992
AND TWO EXTRA

26:32.992 --> 26:33.793
THANKS.

26:33.793 --> 26:35.194
THANKS A LOT,

26:35.194 --> 26:39.165
BUT THE BLANKET WAS JUST,
YOU KNOW, GOODWILL.

26:39.165 --> 26:41.533
GIVE ME YOUR BOOKS.
I'LL CARRY THEM.

26:41.533 --> 26:43.302
WHAT'S THAT GOING
TO COST ME?

26:43.302 --> 26:44.871
IT'S FOR
THE BLANKET, O.K.?

26:44.871 --> 26:47.073
YOU DIDN'T ASK
FOR THE BLANKET,

26:47.073 --> 26:48.975
SO THE BLANKET
DOESN'T COUNT.

26:48.975 --> 26:51.010
I APPRECIATED IT, O.K.?

26:51.010 --> 26:54.847
WOULD YOU APPRECIATE IT
IF I CARRY YOUR BOOKS?

26:57.750 --> 27:00.352

HIP IT UP, HOPPY.
LET'S GO.

27:09.796 --> 27:12.799
HERE WE ARE,
BACK WHERE YOU FOUND ME.

27:12.799 --> 27:14.200
DON'T REMIND ME.

27:14.200 --> 27:17.403
I WONDER WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO READ UPSTAIRS.

27:17.403 --> 27:19.138
BET THE LIGHT'S BETTER.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.891
GERMINAL, RIGHT?

28:13.960 --> 28:16.963
THIS LIBRARY'S LIKE
A CHURCH, ISN'T IT?

28:16.963 --> 28:20.366
WHEN YOU WERE IN CHURCH,
YOU EVER LOOK UP SOMETIMES

28:20.366 --> 28:22.368
AND WONDER WHAT PEOPLE
WERE PRAYING FOR?

28:22.368 --> 28:24.971
DID SOMEONE DIE?
WAS SOMEONE JUST BORN?

28:24.971 --> 28:26.973
LIBRARY'S LIKE THAT
FOR ME.

28:26.973 --> 28:29.608

STAY HERE.

MY RESEARCH PROJECT.

WOMEN--AIN'T THEY PERFECT?

28:42.421 --> 28:43.255
NOT ALWAYS.

28:43.255 --> 28:44.991
YES, THEY ARE.
THEY'RE PERFECT.

28:44.991 --> 28:47.927
DON'T MATTER
IF THEY'RE SKINNY,
FAT, BLONDE, OR BLUE.

28:47.927 --> 28:50.830
IF A WOMAN'S WILLING
TO GIVE YOU HER LOVE,

28:50.830 --> 28:52.832
IT'S THE GREATEST GIFT
IN THE WORLD.

28:52.832 --> 28:54.834

MAKES YOU SMARTER,

28:54.834 --> 28:57.804

ATTRACT ATTENTION.

30:21.653 --> 30:24.490
WINNERS FORGET
THEY'RE IN A RACE.

COST ANYTHING.

31:01.060 --> 31:03.062
I'LL BUY YOU
MORE BUBBLE BATH.

31:03.062 --> 31:06.065
DID YOU GIVE HIM A KEY
TO THE HOUSE?

31:06.065 --> 31:08.467
I SPENT THE DAY WITH HIM.
HE'S HARMLESS.

31:08.467 --> 31:11.070
HE LIKES TO READ.
HE LIKES TO TALK.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.072
I CANNOT TAKE THIS
RIGHT NOW.

31:13.072 --> 31:15.474
I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE

I'M NOT MAKING
MED SCHOOL.

31:18.077 --> 31:19.678
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

31:19.678 --> 31:21.948
I'VE GOT ONE PAGE
OF MY THESIS.

31:21.948 --> 31:23.682
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

31:23.682 --> 31:25.084
I HEARD YOU PRINTING OUT.

31:25.084 --> 31:27.286
SOUNDED LIKE
YOU HAD 50 PAGES.

31:27.286 --> 31:28.220
BLANKS.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.956
I PRINTED OUT BLANKS.

31:29.956 --> 31:32.824
I DIDN'T WANT
YOU GUYS TO KNOW.

31:32.824 --> 31:34.326

31:34.326 --> 31:37.529

I WAS WOUND TIGHT.

31:37.529 --> 31:40.732
GET HIM OUT.
I CANNOT WORK
WITH HIM AROUND.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.734
WHAT IF MY MOM COMES?

31:42.734 --> 31:44.136
O.K., O.K.
CALM DOWN.

31:44.136 --> 31:46.138
YOU'RE STARTING TO
SOUND LIKE BOZ.

31:46.138 --> 31:47.739
I'M NOTHING
LIKE BOZ.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.141
WHO'S LIKE BOZ?

31:49.141 --> 31:51.710
I THOUGHT BOZ
WAS IN BALI,

HE'S WEARING
MY ROBE.

31:53.312 --> 31:54.113
[SNIFFS]

31:54.113 --> 31:55.847
AND IT SMELLS
TERRIFIC.

31:55.847 --> 31:58.250
I DID LEAVE CLOTHES
OUT FOR YOU.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.252
I CAME DOWN
FOR A BEER.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.788
I CAN'T GET DRESSED
WITHOUT A BEER.

32:02.788 --> 32:03.956
LITTLE QUIRK.

32:03.956 --> 32:06.158
MONTY, THIS IS TOTALLY
OUT OF CONTROL.

32:06.158 --> 32:09.861
YOU WAKE UP
ON THE WRONG SIDE
OF THE BED?

32:09.861 --> 32:10.862
LOVER'S QUARREL?

32:10.862 --> 32:12.264
MAYBE I SHOULD LEAVE.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.266
WE'RE NOT LOVERS.
WE'RE ROOMMATES.

32:14.266 --> 32:15.867
WE RESPECT
EACH OTHER'S SPACE.

32:15.867 --> 32:17.669
YOU RESPECT
EACH OTHER'S EMPTY AIR?

32:17.669 --> 32:20.272
THAT'S VERY PROFOUND
FOR HARVARD STUDENTS.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.474

IN THIS HOUSE.

33:17.063 --> 33:19.298
I WAS ABANDONED
BY MY MOMMY.

33:19.298 --> 33:23.302
I WAS RAISED
BY A SHE-WOLF
IN A WYOMING CAVE.

THIS WILL
GET YOU MONEY.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.672
YOU NEED MONEY.

33:26.672 --> 33:28.340
I DON'T. YOU DO.

33:28.340 --> 33:31.743
I'LL ASK AGAIN. DO YOU
HAVE EVIDENCE OF BIRTH?

33:31.743 --> 33:33.145
I'M SITTING HERE,
AIN'T I?

DO YOU THINK I HAPPENED
BY SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION?

YOU SEE THIS FACE,
LADY?

33:43.955 --> 33:45.224
MEMORIZE IT.

33:45.224 --> 33:48.260
SOME DAY THIS BOY'S
GOING TO SAVE THE WORLD.

33:48.260 --> 33:50.596
IF HE'S UNCOOPERATIVE,
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

33:50.596 --> 33:53.499
I GUESS THAT'S
WHY YOU WORK HERE.

33:53.499 --> 33:56.335
CAN I HAVE ONE OF THESE
MUFFINS, LADY?

33:56.335 --> 33:57.869
NO!

33:57.869 --> 33:59.271
I'M SORRY. UH, NO.

33:59.271 --> 34:01.307
CAN'T EVEN GET
A MUFFIN.

34:01.307 --> 34:04.042
HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO GET CASH?

34:04.042 --> 34:06.445
IF YOU PEOPLE ARE IN LINE
FOR MUFFINS,

34:06.445 --> 34:08.045
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.

34:08.045 --> 34:10.681
THEY'RE NOT GIVING ANY OUT.

34:10.681 --> 34:13.952
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WE MADE A DEAL.

34:13.952 --> 34:16.455
I WENT IN,
DIDN'T I?

34:16.455 --> 34:17.889
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE

34:17.889 --> 34:21.059
WHETHER THE MONEY
COMES FROM ME
OR THE GOVERNMENT?

34:21.059 --> 34:23.462
I GOT A GRIEVANCE
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT.

34:23.462 --> 34:25.931
YOU PAID
INTO THE SYSTEM.

34:25.931 --> 34:27.333
YOU SAID YOU WORKED--

34:27.333 --> 34:29.235
SAILOR, LUMBERJACK,
SHORT-ORDER COOK.

34:29.235 --> 34:31.137
OR WAS THAT
ALL BULLSHIT?

34:31.137 --> 34:33.339
THERE YOU GO.
EXCUSE ME.

34:37.243 --> 34:41.246
WELL, WE GOING
TO THE MOVIE
OR WHAT?

34:41.246 --> 34:43.849
A DEAL IS A DEAL,
HARVARD.

34:55.393 --> 34:56.795
* KINDA WOMAN *

34:56.795 --> 34:59.798
* I'D GIVE YOU
MY ALL... *

34:59.798 --> 35:02.401
HEY, EVERETT,
CAN I BORROW
SOME CONDOMS?

35:02.401 --> 35:06.004
NO, BUT YOU CAN HAVE SOME.

35:06.004 --> 35:07.005
ENDURANCE TEST?

35:07.005 --> 35:09.040
MORE LIKE
A POP QUIZ.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.009
OH, COURTNEY.

35:11.009 --> 35:12.678
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

35:12.678 --> 35:14.079
GOOD NIGHT, MONTY.

35:14.079 --> 35:15.681
ARE YOU EXPECTING
AN INVASION?

35:15.681 --> 35:18.284
I DON'T WANT TO BE
MURDERED IN MY BED.

35:18.284 --> 35:22.087
YOUR BED IS THE ONE PLACE
YOU'RE TOTALLY SAFE.

35:22.087 --> 35:23.555
JESUS.

35:28.294 --> 35:31.497
ARE YOU GOING
TO WATCH HIM ALL NIGHT?

35:32.898 --> 35:34.766
LOCKING THE GIRLFRIEND IN?

35:35.967 --> 35:37.569
GOOD NIGHT, LITTLE ONES.

35:37.569 --> 35:42.040
* HAPPINESS,
NO LONGER SAD *

35:42.040 --> 35:44.210
* HAPPINESS *

35:44.210 --> 35:47.513
* I'M GLAD **

35:56.054 --> 35:57.323
OW. OW.

35:57.323 --> 35:58.724
GIVE ME SOME BOOKS.

35:58.724 --> 36:01.527
I'M PERFECTLY CAPABLE
OF CARRYING MY OWN BOOKS,

36:01.527 --> 36:02.528
THANK YOU.

36:09.801 --> 36:11.102
HERE.

36:11.102 --> 36:12.738
CHAPTER TWO.

36:12.738 --> 36:13.939
I READ IT.

36:13.939 --> 36:17.142
THAT STUFF IS REALLY
COMING OUT
THE WRONG END.

36:17.142 --> 36:18.610
SORRY YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT.

36:18.610 --> 36:20.812
THIS ISN'T JUST
SOME TERM PAPER.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.481
THIS IS MY LIFE.

36:22.481 --> 36:25.016
YOUR LIFE IS
A BUNCH OF PAPERS?

36:25.016 --> 36:28.754
MY DREAM IS TO GET
INTO GOVERNMENT
AND HELP PEOPLE.

36:28.754 --> 36:32.358
YOU THINK THOSE IDEAS
ARE GOING
TO HELP PEOPLE?

36:32.358 --> 36:35.494
IT'S A BUNCH OF
PESSIMISTIC JUNK.

36:35.494 --> 36:37.696
THAT'S NOT GOING
TO HELP.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.097
THAT'S GIVING UP.

36:39.097 --> 36:40.499
THE BEST PROFESSOR HERE

36:40.499 --> 36:42.901
HAPPENS TO THINK
THAT THIS HAS PROMISE.

36:42.901 --> 36:46.572
HIS OPINION, NOT YOURS.
THAT'S MY LIFE.

36:47.373 --> 36:49.375
WAIT A MINUTE, HARVARD.

36:49.375 --> 36:51.977
LET ME SHOW YOU MY LIFE.

36:56.648 --> 36:59.451
THERE IT IS.
THAT'S MY LIFE.

36:59.451 --> 37:02.688
I GOT THIS ONE
ON A BEACH IN BALI.

37:02.688 --> 37:05.291
BEST NIGHT'S SLEEP
I EVER HAD.

37:05.291 --> 37:08.994
YOU REMEMBER
ONE NIGHT OF SLEEP?

37:08.994 --> 37:11.263
THE LAST GOOD ONE I HAD.

37:12.998 --> 37:14.700
WHAT'S THIS SHINY WHITE ONE?

37:14.700 --> 37:19.070
YEAH, THAT ONE.
WHAT'S THAT?

37:19.070 --> 37:20.071
A WOMAN.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.673
WHO WAS SHE?

37:21.673 --> 37:23.542
THE ONE.

37:24.510 --> 37:27.513
MY ONE TRUE LOVE.

37:27.513 --> 37:30.416
HOW ABOUT THAT?
YOU'RE A ROMANTIC.

37:30.416 --> 37:33.352
ALL QUITTERS
ARE ROMANTIC, HARVARD.

37:35.186 --> 37:36.522
YEP.

37:36.522 --> 37:39.558
EACH STONE TELLS A STORY
THAT I WANT TO REMEMBER.

37:39.558 --> 37:43.061
ALL I DO--PUT THEM
IN MY HANDS, RUB THEM,

37:43.061 --> 37:45.597
AND ABRACADABRA,
I'M BACK THERE.

37:48.033 --> 37:49.801
GIVE ME YOUR BOOKS.

37:59.545 --> 38:01.747
TELL ME ABOUT THE WOMAN.

38:01.747 --> 38:02.748
I CAN'T.

38:02.748 --> 38:03.615
WHY NOT?

38:03.615 --> 38:05.984
I'M NOT HOLDING
THE STONE.

38:09.321 --> 38:12.524
WHY DON'T WE SIT DOWN?
THERE'S A BENCH.

38:16.194 --> 38:18.196
I ACTUALLY COME HERE
SOMETIMES

38:18.196 --> 38:19.931
WHEN THE WEATHER'S WARM.

38:19.931 --> 38:20.732
YEAH.

38:20.732 --> 38:22.133
IT'S BEAUTIFUL,
ISN'T IT?

38:22.133 --> 38:25.937
I GOT A FRIEND,
SLEEPS ON THAT BENCH
OVER THERE.

38:25.937 --> 38:27.939
I LIKE TO STUDY OUTSIDE.

38:27.939 --> 38:29.741
STUDY? BOY, OH, BOY,

38:29.741 --> 38:31.743
WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO YOU, ANYWAY,
HARVARD?

38:31.743 --> 38:34.746
DIDN'T YOUR FATHER
EVER PLAY BALL
WITH YOU?

38:34.746 --> 38:37.148
LET'S GO,
IF WE WANT TO GET
SOMETHING TO EAT.

38:37.148 --> 38:38.550
HEY, HEY, HEY.

38:38.550 --> 38:40.185
RELAX.
TAKE A BREATHER.

38:40.185 --> 38:41.720
YOU DIDN'T ANSWER
MY QUESTION.

38:41.720 --> 38:43.822
DIDN'T HE EVER
PLAY WITH YOU?

38:43.822 --> 38:46.758
MY PAST ISN'T PART
OF OUR DEAL.

38:46.758 --> 38:48.193
OOH.

38:48.193 --> 38:49.861
EXCUSE ME.

38:53.832 --> 38:57.035
YOU STILL DON'T THINK
I'M HUMAN, DO YOU?

39:01.339 --> 39:03.442
THERE'S NOTHING
TO TELL, O.K.?

39:03.442 --> 39:05.844
MY FATHER LEFT
WHEN I WAS 5.

39:05.844 --> 39:08.447
HE LEFT MY MOTHER
FOR ANOTHER WOMAN.

39:08.447 --> 39:11.450
HE HAD KIDS WITH HER.
WROTE ME ONCE A YEAR.

39:11.450 --> 39:12.851
WHEN I GOT INTO HARVARD,

39:12.851 --> 39:14.853
HE WROTE AND SAID
HOW PROUD HE WAS

39:14.853 --> 39:17.155
AND SORRY
HE COULDN'T HELP
WITH TUITION.

39:17.155 --> 39:20.959
THAT WAS THE LAST
I HEARD FROM HIM
'CAUSE HE DIED.

39:22.994 --> 39:24.396
MY MOM'S TERRIFIC.

39:24.396 --> 39:27.699
UNCLE BILL TOOK ME
TO LITTLE LEAGUE. O.K.?

39:27.699 --> 39:29.501
O.K.

39:29.501 --> 39:31.102
DOESN'T SOUND
TOO TOUGH.

39:31.102 --> 39:32.103
WAS IT?

39:35.373 --> 39:36.575
NO.

39:38.243 --> 39:39.978
HOW ABOUT YOU?

39:39.978 --> 39:41.012
WHAT?

39:41.012 --> 39:44.249
HOW LONG WERE YOU
IN THE MERCHANT MARINE?

39:44.249 --> 39:47.118
UM...NONE OF YOUR
GODDAMN BUSINESS.

40:02.668 --> 40:04.870
SO WHERE WERE YOU
BEFORE HARVARD?

40:04.870 --> 40:05.804
PRINCETON.

40:05.804 --> 40:08.273
I WAS HANGING OUT
WITH AL EINSTEIN.

40:08.273 --> 40:09.675
I KIND OF INSPIRED HIM.

40:09.675 --> 40:11.677
HE GOT STUCK
ON SOME FORMULA.

40:11.677 --> 40:14.079
I TOLD HIM,
"YOU GOT A STEADY JOB,

40:14.079 --> 40:16.682
"YOUR WIFE LOVES YOU.
DON'T MAKE YOURSELF CRAZY.

40:16.682 --> 40:17.883
EVERYTHING'S RELATIVE."

40:48.313 --> 40:50.315
THERE YOU ARE,
MR. FUEL PUMP.

40:50.315 --> 40:51.917
GOOD AS NEW.

40:54.720 --> 40:57.856
JUST IN TIME.
BREAKFAST.

40:57.856 --> 41:00.458
THERE YOU GO, BOY.
ONE PAGE.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.060
WHAT IS THIS?

41:02.060 --> 41:02.861
OATMEAL.

41:02.861 --> 41:05.330
ROUGHAGE.
IT'S GOOD FOR YOU.

41:05.330 --> 41:07.198
GOOD FOR A HORSE.

41:07.198 --> 41:09.601
GIVE ME THAT
PAGE BACK. HERE.

41:09.601 --> 41:11.202
EAT UP, SIMON.

41:11.202 --> 41:14.072
GOT A BIG SURPRISE
FOR YOU.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.874
OUR FOUNDING FATHERS,

41:15.874 --> 41:18.744
OR TO BE
POLITICALLY CORRECT,

41:18.744 --> 41:22.347
OUR FOUNDING PARENTS,

41:22.347 --> 41:25.483
DESIGNED THE CONSTITUTION
TO PREVENT THE PRESIDENCY

41:25.483 --> 41:28.954
FROM BECOMING ANOTHER FORM
OF TYRANNY,

41:28.954 --> 41:32.357
AN ELECTED KING.

41:32.357 --> 41:35.393
WELL, DID THEY SUCCEED?

41:35.393 --> 41:36.995
I SMELL AN AMBUSH.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.129
MISS MOORE,

41:38.129 --> 41:39.731
YOU HAVE AN ANSWER.

41:42.768 --> 41:45.503
THE PRESIDENT IS NOT
AN ELECTED KING.

41:45.503 --> 41:46.938
INDEED.

41:46.938 --> 41:49.608
COULD THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES,

41:49.608 --> 41:52.410
WITHOUT CONSULTING
THOSE HE GOVERNS,

41:52.410 --> 41:55.847
MORE OR LESS DESTROY
THE ENTIRE WORLD?

41:55.847 --> 41:58.316
WELL, I GUESS HE COULD.

41:58.316 --> 41:59.718
YOU GUESS HE COULD.

41:59.718 --> 42:01.720
COULD JULIUS CAESAR
HAVE DONE THAT?

42:01.720 --> 42:02.721
COULD NAPOLEON?

42:02.721 --> 42:05.724
COULD ADOLF HITLER?

42:05.724 --> 42:07.058
BUT THEY TRIED TO.

42:07.058 --> 42:09.527
AREN'T YOU MAKING
A FALSE ANALOGY?

42:09.527 --> 42:12.463
OH, THIS IS
MY LUCKY DAY.

42:12.463 --> 42:13.865
I ASK A QUESTION,

42:13.865 --> 42:16.935
AND I GET A QUESTION
IN RESPONSE.

42:16.935 --> 42:20.138
YOU DO BELONG IN
GOVERNMENT, MY DEAR.

42:20.138 --> 42:21.539
SIT DOWN, PLEASE.

42:21.539 --> 42:24.275
NOW DOES ANYONE HAVE
AN ANSWER FOR ME

42:24.275 --> 42:25.677
INSTEAD OF A QUIZ?

42:25.677 --> 42:27.278
DON'T BE A HERO, BOY.

42:27.278 --> 42:29.147
MR. KESSLER.

42:29.147 --> 42:30.148
YOUR THOUGHTS.

42:30.148 --> 42:33.151
THE PRESIDENT CAN'T BOMB
WITHOUT REASON.

42:33.151 --> 42:34.552
HE HAS A REASON.

42:34.552 --> 42:37.823
HE THINKS WE NEED
MORE PARKING SPACES.

42:37.823 --> 42:40.826
THE POINT IS,
CAN HE DESTROY
THE WORLD?

42:40.826 --> 42:42.560
NOT WITHOUT CONGRESS.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.563
MR. KESSLER,
AFTER FOUR YEARS
OF HARVARD,

42:45.563 --> 42:47.232
HAS IT ESCAPED
YOUR ATTENTION

42:47.232 --> 42:50.435
THAT THE PRESIDENT
CAN MAKE WAR FOR 90 DAYS

42:50.435 --> 42:51.970
WITHOUT CONSULTING
CONGRESS?

42:51.970 --> 42:53.739
UH...

42:53.739 --> 42:55.707
WELL, THA-THAT'S RIGHT.

42:55.707 --> 42:57.843
THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
MR. KESSLER.

42:57.843 --> 43:01.412
AT LEAST I'M GOING
TO PASS THIS COURSE.

43:01.412 --> 43:03.048
SIT DOWN, PLEASE.

43:04.315 --> 43:07.352
MY QUESTION STILL STANDS.

43:07.352 --> 43:08.720
WHAT IS

43:08.720 --> 43:10.856
THE PARTICULAR GENIUS
OF THE CONSTITUTION?

43:10.856 --> 43:12.423
NICE TRY,
GENERAL CUSTER.

43:12.423 --> 43:13.825
SHUT UP.

43:13.825 --> 43:16.928
WHAT QUALITY DISTINGUISHES
THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION?

43:16.928 --> 43:19.665
I TOLD YOU NOT
TO STAND UP.

43:19.665 --> 43:21.532
YOU CAN'T TALK
IN HERE.

43:21.532 --> 43:22.567
YOU, SIR.

43:22.567 --> 43:23.568
YOU, SIR!

43:23.568 --> 43:24.569
WHO, ME?

43:24.569 --> 43:26.604
DO YOU HAVE
AN OPINION?

43:26.604 --> 43:27.639
NO.

43:27.639 --> 43:29.975
ARE YOU A STUDENT?

43:29.975 --> 43:31.309
NO.

43:31.309 --> 43:34.279
ARE YOU A GUEST?

43:34.279 --> 43:36.682
NO, I'M A BUM.

43:36.682 --> 43:38.383
THERE ARE NO BUMS.

43:38.383 --> 43:41.386
THERE ARE ONLY
THE FINANCIALLY
CHALLENGED.

43:41.386 --> 43:43.154
NO, I'M A BUM...

43:43.154 --> 43:44.089
[LAUGHTER]

43:44.089 --> 43:46.792
BUT BEAR IN MIND,
I'M A HARVARD BUM.

43:46.792 --> 43:48.794
YOU MUST BE
THE LOGICAL RESULT

43:48.794 --> 43:51.029
OF AN OPEN
ADMISSIONS POLICY.

43:52.163 --> 43:53.131
NO, SIR.

43:53.131 --> 43:55.834
MY PRESENCE HERE
IS THE LOGICAL RESULT

43:55.834 --> 43:57.803
OF THE SEARCH
FOR EDIBLE GARBAGE.

43:57.803 --> 43:59.570
YOU'RE HERE
FOR THE GARBAGE.

43:59.570 --> 44:00.672
THAT'S RIGHT.

44:00.672 --> 44:03.008
COLLEGES PRODUCE
A LOT OF GARBAGE,

44:03.008 --> 44:05.911
AND HARVARD PRODUCES
MORE THAN MOST.

44:08.179 --> 44:10.315
WHAT WIT.

44:10.315 --> 44:12.450
INSPIRED NO DOUBT BY...

44:12.450 --> 44:14.185
WILD TURKEY?

44:15.320 --> 44:17.122
YOU ASK FOR CHARITY,

44:17.122 --> 44:19.390
PLEADING THAT SOCIETY
HAS FAILED YOU

44:19.390 --> 44:20.692
AND YOU NEED HELP,

44:20.692 --> 44:22.160
BUT ACTUALLY,
YOU'RE QUITE CAPABLE,

44:22.160 --> 44:27.265
AND WHAT YOU REALLY WANT
IS ALCOHOLIC BLISS.

44:31.002 --> 44:33.138
I WOULD RATHER DRINK
RUBBING ALCOHOL

44:33.138 --> 44:35.741
THAN LISTEN TO YOU,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN.

44:35.741 --> 44:38.143
AND ACCORDING TO
THE 21st AMENDMENT,

44:38.143 --> 44:41.012
YOU CAN DRINK
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

44:42.748 --> 44:43.749
SIMON.

44:43.749 --> 44:46.417
WHICH DOOR
DO I LEAVE FROM?

44:46.417 --> 44:50.221
AT HARVARD, WE DON'T
END OUR SENTENCES
WITH PREPOSITIONS.

44:50.221 --> 44:51.757
WELL, IN THAT CASE,

44:51.757 --> 44:54.960
WHICH DOOR DO
I LEAVE FROM, ASSHOLE?

44:56.594 --> 44:59.865
WHAT DEMOCRATIC ELOQUENCE.

45:01.199 --> 45:03.401
YOU ASKED
THE QUESTION, SIR.

45:03.401 --> 45:04.803
LET ME ANSWER IT.

45:04.803 --> 45:06.772
THE GENIUS
OF THE CONSTITUTION

45:06.772 --> 45:08.774
IS IT CAN ALWAYS
BE CHANGED.

45:08.774 --> 45:11.076
THE GENIUS
OF THE CONSTITUTION

45:11.076 --> 45:12.878
IS IT MAKES
NO PERMANENT RULE

45:12.878 --> 45:17.682
OTHER THAN ITS FAITH
IN THE WISDOM OF PEOPLE
TO GOVERN THEMSELVES.

45:17.682 --> 45:20.085
FAITH IN THE WISDOM
OF THE PEOPLE

45:20.085 --> 45:24.689
IS EXACTLY WHAT MAKES
THE CONSTITUTION
INCOMPLETE AND CRUDE.

45:24.689 --> 45:26.057
CRUDE?

45:26.057 --> 45:26.992
NO, SIR.

45:26.992 --> 45:28.459
OUR FOUNDING PARENTS

45:28.459 --> 45:30.929
WERE POMPOUS,
MIDDLE-AGED
WHITE FARMERS,

45:30.929 --> 45:32.931
BUT THEY WERE
ALSO GREAT MEN

45:32.931 --> 45:34.532
BECAUSE THEY KNEW
ONE THING

45:34.532 --> 45:36.534
THAT ALL GREAT MEN
SHOULD KNOW--

45:36.534 --> 45:37.936
THAT THEY DIDN'T
KNOW EVERYTHING.

45:37.936 --> 45:39.938
THEY KNEW THEY WOULD
MAKE MISTAKES,

45:39.938 --> 45:42.340
BUT THEY LEFT A WAY
TO CORRECT THEM.

45:42.340 --> 45:44.943
THEY DIDN'T THINK OF
THEMSELVES AS LEADERS.

45:44.943 --> 45:47.578
THEY WANTED
A GOVERNMENT
OF CITIZENS,

45:47.578 --> 45:48.814
NOT ROYALTY.

45:48.814 --> 45:50.949
A GOVERNMENT
OF LISTENERS,

45:50.949 --> 45:52.083
NOT LECTURERS.

45:52.083 --> 45:53.885
A GOVERNMENT
THAT COULD CHANGE,

45:53.885 --> 45:55.686
NOT STAND STILL.

45:55.686 --> 45:58.356
THE PRESIDENT
ISN'T AN ELECTED KING

45:58.356 --> 46:01.392
NO MATTER HOW MANY BOMBS
HE CAN DROP,

46:01.392 --> 46:05.230
BECAUSE THE CRUDE
CONSTITUTION
DOESN'T TRUST HIM.

46:05.230 --> 46:07.966
HE'S A SERVANT
OF THE PEOPLE.

46:07.966 --> 46:11.469
HE'S A BUM,
O.K., MR. PITKANNAN?

46:11.469 --> 46:13.304
HE'S JUST A BUM,

46:13.304 --> 46:16.107
AND THE ONLY BLISS
THAT HE'S SEARCHING FOR

46:16.107 --> 46:19.510
IS FREEDOM AND JUSTICE.

46:35.526 --> 46:36.928
MR. KESSLER.

46:38.997 --> 46:40.798
I'M SORRY, SIR.

46:48.840 --> 46:50.608
HEY, SIMON,
ARE YOU O.K.?

46:50.608 --> 46:52.343
WHAT CAN I DO?

47:00.751 --> 47:02.220
I'M FINE.

47:04.990 --> 47:07.993
NOW THAT I'VE TAUGHT
AT HARVARD, BOY,

47:07.993 --> 47:10.261
IT'S ALL DOWNHILL
FROM HERE.

47:25.510 --> 47:27.578
COURT, DO YOU THINK DEBBY

47:27.578 --> 47:29.580
IS A SEDUCTIVE PINOT NOIR

47:29.580 --> 47:31.249
OR A NUTTY CABERNET?

47:31.249 --> 47:33.584

WITH HELGA?

47:33.584 --> 47:34.986
OH, I LOVE 'EM BOTH.

47:34.986 --> 47:36.988
WHEN ARE YOU
GOING TO REALIZE

47:36.988 --> 47:39.390
WOMEN ARE MORE THAN JUST
FERMENTED GRAPE JUICE?

47:39.390 --> 47:42.393
WHEN WILL YOU REALIZE
MEN ARE MORE THAN MEAT?

47:42.393 --> 47:44.395
THE DAY I BECOME
A VEGETARIAN.

47:44.395 --> 47:46.998
IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO
BELOW 0 TONIGHT.

47:46.998 --> 47:49.000
CAN HE SLEEP
IN THE CELLAR?

47:49.000 --> 47:50.401
NO PROBLEM.
SURE.

47:50.401 --> 47:52.737
NO PROBLEM?
THERE'S A BIG PROBLEM.

47:52.737 --> 47:54.139
I'M SICK OF THIS.

47:54.139 --> 47:57.542
I'M SICK OF PAYING EXTRA
TO LIVE WITH A BUM

47:57.542 --> 48:00.145
WHILE I GET RAGGED
BECAUSE I WANT TO STUDY.

48:00.145 --> 48:02.747
BRING HIM INSIDE,
AND I'M LEAVING.

48:02.747 --> 48:04.582
THEN LEAVE.

48:04.582 --> 48:05.750
I'M SERIOUS.

48:05.750 --> 48:08.954

TO COVER MY RENT?

48:09.754 --> 48:12.157

TO HELP YOU OUT,

48:15.426 --> 48:19.330

TO SEE JEFF LEAVE.

IT'S NOT A FUNNY JOKE.

49:01.539 --> 49:04.742

49:04.742 --> 49:06.811
WHERE'S THE BLANKET

49:06.811 --> 49:08.946
