00:04.872 --> 00:06.112
Previously on E.R.

00:06.113 --> 00:07.904
- ¿You're what?
- I'm pregnant.

00:07.905 --> 00:11.462
I wanted to have a baby with Doug.
I don't want to be a single mother.

00:11.463 --> 00:13.342
There is another heartbeat.

00:14.466 --> 00:15.891
¿Twins?

00:15.892 --> 00:18.811
My flight was overbooked,
so I volunteered to take a later one.

00:18.812 --> 00:20.834
Dad, you don't have to worry about saving
a couple of hundred bucks.

00:20.835 --> 00:22.126
You know? I can buy you a ticket.

00:22.127 --> 00:23.525
I can afford my own ticket, Mark.

00:23.526 --> 00:24.857
Taking a breather?

00:24.858 --> 00:26.727
You know, my breathing is fine but...

00:27.128 --> 00:28.761
my ankles are about to explode.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.002
Are you all right?

00:30.103 --> 00:33.138
Yeah, yeah, it's just they are active.

00:33.173 --> 00:34.748
May I?

00:36.137 --> 00:39.009

02:16.584 --> 02:17.996
I guess winter's here.

02:18.212 --> 02:20.291
Yeah. Aren't you freezing?

02:20.509 --> 02:22.302
Not once I get warmed up.

02:22.513 --> 02:24.721
I used to be that thin, you know.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.519
Stabbed me through the bird.
I was stuffing the turkey.

02:30.696 --> 02:34.448
- Hey, Kerry.
- Hey! Wasn't yesterday your last day?

02:34.662 --> 02:37.369
I need to show Lydia the report.

02:37.584 --> 02:39.044
She took off.

02:39.212 --> 02:41.088
- What?
- To Wisconsin.

02:41.300 --> 02:44.588
- You should have been here at 8.
- She had a shift.

02:44.806 --> 02:48.559
- Yeah, the night shift.
- Why didn't she call me?

02:48.731 --> 02:52.150
- She didn't wanna bother you.
- Do you feel all right?

02:52.363 --> 02:54.322
No, my back is killing me.

02:54.534 --> 02:57.074
Why don't you stay for the potluck?

02:57.289 --> 03:00.744
I'll go home,
store up my energy for my family.

03:00.963 --> 03:05.012
- I got you down for dessert.
- Sorry, pregnancy casualty.

03:05.222 --> 03:06.848
What, no pie?

03:11.442 --> 03:15.907
- Wait! Time out!
- No time-outs in a snowball fight!

03:16.118 --> 03:18.279
- I'm a girl!
- Who tried to ambush me.

03:18.499 --> 03:21.372
- That's mature.
- You want a piece of this?

03:21.588 --> 03:24.675
- Don't even think about it.
- Now you're dead.

03:31.065 --> 03:33.356
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

04:04.632 --> 04:06.460
Oh, my God!

05:10.929 --> 05:13.719
Carol? Carol, are you all right?

05:16.023 --> 05:17.186
My water broke.

05:17.358 --> 05:20.197
- How long ago?
- Fifteen minutes.

05:20.407 --> 05:23.030
You're having contractions?
How many?

05:23.204 --> 05:24.450
- Two.
- How far apart?

05:24.665 --> 05:26.707
Seven, eight minutes.

05:27.045 --> 05:31.212
- Did anyone call an ambulance?
- County's just one stop back.

05:31.553 --> 05:35.887
- Why don't you get on?
- You try walking with labor pain.

05:36.104 --> 05:38.395
Yeah. How far along are you?

05:38.567 --> 05:39.683
Oh, 38 weeks.

05:40.738 --> 05:42.614
Was the amniotic fluid clear?

05:42.825 --> 05:45.949
- Hard to tell on the El.
- No meconium then?

05:46.166 --> 05:48.873
- I don't think so.
- Good, good.

05:51.719 --> 05:56.266
- I could be at this a while.
- We wait for the next train.

05:56.436 --> 05:58.929
In five minutes we call an ambulance.

05:59.150 --> 06:00.859
Oh, yeah.

06:03.032 --> 06:04.694
-10-9!
- That ain't fair.

06:04.911 --> 06:07.369
- No hands.
- That's what a goalie does.

06:07.583 --> 06:10.540
- Use the chair.
- Whatever. I still own you.

06:11.090 --> 06:12.122
Hey, Cleo.

06:12.342 --> 06:14.671
- Working hard, Dave?
- I'm fast.

06:15.516 --> 06:16.547
Oh!

06:18.104 --> 06:20.942
- I'm cool. I'm cool.
- Hey, Dr. Weaver.

06:21.152 --> 06:24.440
- Finish your notes, Dr. Malucci?
- Absolutely.

06:24.658 --> 06:28.612
Is it always this slow
on Thanksgiving?

06:28.833 --> 06:32.917
If you're bored, study for
your National In-Service Exam.

06:33.133 --> 06:35.009
Don't bring down the average.

06:35.179 --> 06:37.673
- I thought you liked me.
- Why?

06:37.852 --> 06:40.772
- It'll pick up once people eat.
- Barf Central.

06:40.983 --> 06:45.198
It started. Shelly Robinson, 18,
vomiting and diarrhea.

06:45.408 --> 06:47.319
Altered mental status.

06:47.537 --> 06:51.753
Gave her fluids and Compazine,
but her glucose is still 42.

06:51.962 --> 06:53.624
Get an endocrine consult?

06:53.841 --> 06:56.929
- He's stuffing his face.
- Get a travel history?

06:57.140 --> 06:59.134
- Not outside the U.S.
- Florida?

06:59.352 --> 07:04.066
- She just got back from there.
- Ask her if she ate an oily fruit.

07:04.279 --> 07:06.736
Akee fruit. Poisonous if not ripe.

07:06.908 --> 07:10.661
Induces vomiting
and low blood glucose.

07:10.875 --> 07:12.252
- Known as JVS.
- JVS.

07:12.420 --> 07:14.794
Jamaican Vomiting Sickness.

07:15.175 --> 07:18.382
But the Akee also grows
in southern Florida.

07:18.599 --> 07:20.593
- You're kidding.
- Start an infusion.

07:20.811 --> 07:22.806
There's a high fatality rate.

07:25.905 --> 07:28.992
If you don't believe me,
check the differential.

07:30.790 --> 07:32.665
Might be a doctor after all.

07:32.877 --> 07:36.416
- Jamaican Vomiting Sickness?
- Look it up, John.

07:37.553 --> 07:39.548
Jamaican Vomiting Sickness.

07:39.766 --> 07:41.345
Okay, a little step.

07:41.561 --> 07:44.815
- Thank you for this.
- Not a problem. It's okay.

07:44.985 --> 07:46.266
- Oh!
- A contraction?

07:46.487 --> 07:49.326
- Oh, yeah!
- Okay. Sit here. Sit here.

07:49.535 --> 07:51.744
- Oh!
- Maybe standing is better?

07:51.915 --> 07:52.947
Yeah.

07:53.585 --> 07:56.505
Carol, have you taken
a birthing class?

07:58.094 --> 08:01.597
Look at something.
Try to stare. Stay focused.

08:01.810 --> 08:05.228
- Is she having a baby?
- We're okay. Just started.

08:05.693 --> 08:08.067
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm a doctor.

08:08.281 --> 08:10.952
She doesn't look all right to me.

08:11.620 --> 08:13.781
I better pull the emergency cord.

08:14.000 --> 08:16.375
- That stops the train.
- She needs help.

08:16.589 --> 08:18.465
We only have to go one stop.

08:18.676 --> 08:20.636
- Let's be safe.
- Don't pull it!

08:20.847 --> 08:25.312
- It says "Pull in case of emergency. "
- This isn't that kind!

08:25.523 --> 08:27.981
"Police, fire, medical emergency. "

08:28.195 --> 08:31.365
Don't pull the damn cord! Oh, God!

08:31.577 --> 08:33.655
- Can she cook?
- What a question.

08:33.873 --> 08:36.413
- She can't.
- I don't know. We eat out.

08:36.628 --> 08:39.501
My experience with English food:
it's bland.

08:39.717 --> 08:42.886
- Would you rather I cook?
- Is she pretty?

08:43.099 --> 08:44.179
Yes, she's pretty.

08:44.394 --> 08:46.852
- Prettier than Cynthia?
- Different.

08:47.065 --> 08:50.734
- Beauty is overrated.
- She's pretty! Jeez!

08:51.867 --> 08:53.909
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- See?

08:54.122 --> 08:55.153
- What?
- Nothing.

08:55.374 --> 08:57.748
This is my father, David Greene.

08:57.962 --> 09:00.122
- Nice hat.
- Thank you. Come in.

09:00.301 --> 09:02.045
- This is Rachel.
- Hello.

09:02.263 --> 09:05.635
You don't wear those.
They're decorations.

09:05.811 --> 09:10.775
Well, I saw it in the drugstore,
and I thought it looked cute.

09:11.197 --> 09:12.360
I got the wine.

09:12.574 --> 09:14.319
- I'll open it.
- I'll get it.

09:14.536 --> 09:16.995
Scotch and soda for me,
if you have it.

09:17.209 --> 09:20.415
I think I might.
Rachel, something to drink?

09:20.632 --> 09:22.425
- Can I have some wine?
- No!

09:22.636 --> 09:24.215
- I have soda.
- Okay.

09:24.431 --> 09:28.682
- Mind if I turn on the game?
- My telly's broken, I'm afraid.

09:28.857 --> 09:29.889
Doesn't work?

09:30.109 --> 09:33.232
My neighbor was stealing his cable.

09:33.449 --> 09:36.656
The company came
and snapped the wrong line.

09:36.873 --> 09:39.544
- On Thanksgiving?
- No, a month ago.

09:39.753 --> 09:42.544
I haven't had time to ring up
and complain.

09:42.759 --> 09:46.298
- No football.
- We can play charades, if you like.

09:49.231 --> 09:53.398
- Let me just sit, okay?
- You're in active labor.

09:53.572 --> 09:57.075
Oh, gee! You think?
I'm sorry. I just...

09:57.288 --> 09:59.082
You might've progressed more.

09:59.251 --> 10:02.919
No, I'm okay. It just hurts.

10:03.133 --> 10:06.090
How dilated were you
on your last visit?

10:06.306 --> 10:08.550
- Three centimeters.
- Back pain?

10:08.769 --> 10:10.348
For the last three months.

10:10.564 --> 10:12.892
- Worse lately?
- This morning.

10:14.155 --> 10:17.028
- Let's go.
- Can't I have the babies here?

10:17.244 --> 10:20.913
- Wanna make the news?
- They're between my knees!

10:21.127 --> 10:23.371
- That's the idea.
- Son of a bitch!

10:23.673 --> 10:28.637
Okay, sit. Sit here, come on.
Okay, focus. Focus, Carol.

10:30.354 --> 10:31.849
- Try humming.
- Huh?

10:32.065 --> 10:33.395
It sounds very strange.

10:33.610 --> 10:36.733
But it helped my wife.
Just hum, like this.

10:38.411 --> 10:39.575
Yeah, just do it.

10:43.839 --> 10:45.216
Okay.

10:49.475 --> 10:52.514
Hey, remember
that renal-failure patient?

10:52.689 --> 10:54.066
Diverted to Mercy?

10:54.276 --> 10:57.980
- Some guy plowed into the ambulance.
- That was smart.

10:58.201 --> 11:02.534
Good call on the akee.
She bought off a curbside vendor.

11:02.709 --> 11:05.084
- I told you so.
- How did you know?

11:05.298 --> 11:06.758
I'm a good doctor.

11:06.968 --> 11:09.046
And I might've seen it before.

11:09.222 --> 11:12.975
Where? No, don't tell me.
You did the Peace Corps?

11:13.188 --> 11:17.689
I spent time in the jungle.
I'll show you my piranha scars.

11:17.906 --> 11:20.066
- Come on.
- You owe me a favor.

11:20.244 --> 11:21.954
What is this, a secret?

11:23.250 --> 11:27.715
Suddenly sensitive?
Did you lose a patient to this?

11:27.926 --> 11:29.755
Fine. I saw it in Grenada.

11:29.972 --> 11:33.558
- You did a rotation there?
- I went to med school there.

11:33.729 --> 11:34.761
Oh...

11:34.981 --> 11:38.105
Oh. Your first choice?

11:38.322 --> 11:41.908
I had fun in college.
My grades sucked.

11:42.121 --> 11:44.579
My MCATs- Long story.

11:44.793 --> 11:49.589
I knew I'd be a better doctor
than others who only cared for tests.

11:49.802 --> 11:52.343
- Gotcha.
- So I did Grenada.

11:52.558 --> 11:55.478
- The Harvard of the Caribbean.
- I'm sure.

11:55.647 --> 11:59.863
Still says M.D., Carter. See? M.D.

12:00.073 --> 12:03.659
I know. Now I can
appreciate you that much more.

12:03.872 --> 12:07.042
- Good.
- So, what did you get on your MCATs?

12:07.254 --> 12:08.714
All right.

12:10.385 --> 12:14.683
- It started snowing again.
- Yeah. You ready?

12:15.102 --> 12:17.478
- I think so.
- Okay.

12:18.735 --> 12:20.776
How long was your wife in labor?

12:20.989 --> 12:24.777
- Sixteen hours, for the first.
- How many has she had?

12:24.997 --> 12:27.836
Two. At different times.

12:28.546 --> 12:32.168
- They still live in Croatia?
- No, not anymore.

12:33.222 --> 12:35.466
- Oh!
- What? Okay, sit. Sit down.

12:35.685 --> 12:38.689
Come on. Deep breaths.
And don't worry.

12:38.900 --> 12:41.572
It's a vagal reaction
to the contractions.

12:41.739 --> 12:43.151
Deep breaths.

12:45.830 --> 12:47.825
- I need a bathroom!
- Almost there.

12:48.043 --> 12:51.250
- I have to go!
- We must hurry. Can you stand?

12:51.967 --> 12:54.009
What is it? Another contraction?

12:54.222 --> 12:57.262
Already? Okay. Okay.

12:57.479 --> 12:59.888
Don't push. Listen to me, Carol.

13:00.109 --> 13:03.980
Carol, don't push, okay? Carol?

13:06.496 --> 13:07.729
Carol?

13:24.547 --> 13:29.010
Woman with chronic renal failure.
Missed her dialysis.

13:29.179 --> 13:30.342
Any other injuries?

13:30.556 --> 13:33.512
Maybe chest trauma.
Responded to O2 but...

13:33.728 --> 13:35.602
- ... decompensated.
- Anyone else?

13:35.814 --> 13:39.185
Zadro, his elbow.
The jerk who hit him is behind us.

13:40.905 --> 13:41.937
Kerry!

13:43.534 --> 13:45.492
- My God!
- We need a gurney here!

13:49.710 --> 13:52.878
- What happened?
- Vagal reaction.

13:53.090 --> 13:55.879
- Is she in labor?
- Yeah.

14:07.160 --> 14:10.114
- She had a syncopal episode.
- I'm fine.

14:10.330 --> 14:12.535
- Contractions?
- Every three minutes.

14:12.748 --> 14:14.028
- Babies moving?
- All day.

14:14.249 --> 14:15.364
- What's wrong?
- Think!

14:15.583 --> 14:17.243
- What's open?
- Trauma rooms.

14:17.419 --> 14:19.744
No, Kerry. Just take me upstairs.

14:19.920 --> 14:23.371
I wanna check you out. Who's your OB?

14:23.591 --> 14:26.259
McLucas. Please, Kerry.
Take me upstairs.

14:26.468 --> 14:29.634
In a minute. Malik, page Dr. McLucas.

14:29.846 --> 14:32.003
- Is he on the on-call list?
- She.

14:32.223 --> 14:33.966
Want a fetal monitor?

14:34.183 --> 14:36.638
- Get the Doppler scope.
- I'm going upstairs!

14:36.852 --> 14:39.768
- I could use help.
- Luka, can you help him?

14:39.979 --> 14:41.888
- Yeah, sure.
- Should I call Mark?

14:42.106 --> 14:44.264
- He's off.
- He's her Lamaze coach.

14:44.483 --> 14:46.440
You want us to call Mark?

14:46.652 --> 14:48.644
Okay, let's go nice and easy.

14:49.987 --> 14:53.107
I'm not used to serving so early.

14:53.282 --> 14:57.610
We need time to gorge ourselves
so we can pass out.

14:58.620 --> 15:02.403
- It says 180.
- You didn't have to do all this.

15:02.623 --> 15:04.662
Those two can be a bit much.

15:04.875 --> 15:07.448
All families are eccentric.

15:07.628 --> 15:09.003
I guess.

15:09.504 --> 15:11.829
Okay, everybody, dinner is served.

15:12.048 --> 15:13.542
- Hit me.
- You have 18.

15:13.757 --> 15:15.666
Soft 18 against your nine.

15:15.884 --> 15:18.256
Rachel, can you get the potatoes?

15:18.469 --> 15:20.177
- Smells good.
- I hope it is.

15:20.388 --> 15:23.139
- What's that on top there?
- Bacon.

15:23.349 --> 15:24.677
On the turkey?

15:25.393 --> 15:28.594
- You don't have it that way?
- Rachel? Potatoes.

15:28.811 --> 15:31.895
I didn't think
you celebrated Thanksgiving.

15:32.106 --> 15:34.063
It's not really my holiday.

15:34.275 --> 15:37.607
The Pilgrims tried to escape
British persecution.

15:37.819 --> 15:40.653
So they could persecute the Indians.

15:40.863 --> 15:43.614
Okay, everybody. Now.

15:43.824 --> 15:45.152
- I'll do that.
- I got it.

15:45.325 --> 15:48.076
- I said I'd do it.
- Don't worry. Relax.

15:48.286 --> 15:52.497
- Mark doesn't think I can do things.
- Be my guest.

15:52.665 --> 15:54.990
He wants to put me in a nursing home.

15:55.209 --> 15:58.992
- It's a retirement community.
- One with nurses.

15:59.212 --> 16:03.339
- Can we talk later?
- You wanted to talk last night.

16:06.385 --> 16:07.760
Sorry.

16:08.387 --> 16:11.471
That's all right.
I think I have instant.

16:11.681 --> 16:13.637
- Are you on-call?
- It's yours.

16:13.849 --> 16:16.766
Let's clean this up, shall we?

16:17.227 --> 16:19.019
Okay, ready? And lift.

16:19.188 --> 16:22.058
Lungs are wet. Not making any urine.

16:22.274 --> 16:24.680
Why did you miss your dialysis?

16:24.900 --> 16:27.521
I was having my hair done.

16:28.528 --> 16:32.146
It's nice to look good,
but your health comes first.

16:32.365 --> 16:34.156
You think I look good?

16:34.366 --> 16:36.026
Yeah, beautiful.

16:36.869 --> 16:38.244
It's for my birthday.

16:38.454 --> 16:39.912
- Today?
- Yes.

16:40.122 --> 16:42.363
- Happy birthday.
- Well, thank you.

16:42.540 --> 16:45.624
BP's 102 over 54. Pulse is 124.

16:45.835 --> 16:48.752
Congestive failure.
Wet crackles halfway up.

16:48.962 --> 16:49.993
You want Lasix?

16:50.213 --> 16:52.834
No. Start a drip,
call the dialysis unit.

16:53.049 --> 16:54.876
Can I call a family member?

16:55.093 --> 16:56.835
No, that's all right.

16:57.761 --> 16:59.717
I'm sorry. Sternal tenderness.

16:59.929 --> 17:03.049
This is why idiots need
to stop for ambulances.

17:03.266 --> 17:06.550
Muffled heart sounds.
Check for pulsus paradoxis.

17:06.727 --> 17:09.015
Heart? What's wrong with my heart?

17:09.229 --> 17:13.012
Your fluid overloaded
from missing your dialysis.

17:13.232 --> 17:17.396
Fluid is collecting around your heart
from renal failure.

17:17.569 --> 17:20.238
It could also be an injury
from the accident.

17:20.446 --> 17:21.560
Oh, my!

17:21.740 --> 17:25.071
Enalapril 1.25 IV push,
and get me an ultrasound.

17:25.242 --> 17:29.109
- They're using it next door.
- Then get me another one.

17:30.246 --> 17:33.911
Carol, you're pushing, honey.
Don't push. Betadine?

17:34.124 --> 17:37.160
Doppler sounds good.
Fetal heart tones are 140.

17:37.377 --> 17:38.919
BP's 112 over 70.

17:39.129 --> 17:41.750
- Legs up, Carol
- The contraction's over?

17:41.923 --> 17:42.953
Almost, yeah.

17:43.174 --> 17:46.293
I'm gonna check your cervix, Carol.
Relax.

17:46.677 --> 17:49.298
- You'll remember this Thanksgiving.
- Yeah.

17:55.726 --> 18:00.019
- Kerry, what is it?
- You're at 10 centimeters, Carol.

18:00.230 --> 18:02.057
- What?
- Fully effaced.

18:02.274 --> 18:03.815
Haleh, open an OB pack.

18:04.024 --> 18:06.811
I don't wanna deliver in the ER!

18:07.027 --> 18:10.063
- How about the elevator?
- Ten centimeters?

18:10.280 --> 18:13.114
Probably been contracting all day.

18:13.282 --> 18:16.449
Let's rotate the gurney
for some privacy.

18:16.660 --> 18:20.408
No, Kerry, I'll hold it.
I promise I won't push!

18:20.622 --> 18:22.329
Let's make a deal.

18:22.540 --> 18:26.703
We'll deliver this one down here
and the next one upstairs.

18:26.919 --> 18:28.792
Lift up your butt, Carol.

18:28.963 --> 18:32.662
We'll do the second one
on the ultrasound.

18:32.882 --> 18:35.883
- Get out, Carter!
- It's okay, Carol.

18:36.093 --> 18:38.299
- Sterile gloves.
- Carter, get out!

18:38.470 --> 18:41.044
I got it.
See if Dr. Kovac needs help.

18:41.264 --> 18:43.885
- I've delivered before!
- Not this one!

18:44.308 --> 18:46.466
- Dr. Weaver?
- She knows you.

18:46.644 --> 18:49.561
- She paged Dr. Greene.
- He's not delivering.

18:49.772 --> 18:51.847
- Okay. Good luck.
- Oh, God!

18:52.065 --> 18:54.057
Okay, let's break the bed down.

18:54.275 --> 18:57.809
- Fifteen of Etomidate, 100 of sux.
- BP's 80 systolic.

18:58.028 --> 19:01.313
- Get me an alligator clip.
- You need some help?

19:01.531 --> 19:03.156
- Please intubate.
- What is it?

19:03.366 --> 19:07.446
Pericardial effusion.
It's the trauma or her renal failure.

19:07.745 --> 19:10.235
- Pressure's down to 70.
- ET tube.

19:10.455 --> 19:14.499
- Is she having the babies in there?
- At least one.

19:15.668 --> 19:16.699
V- fib!

19:18.670 --> 19:20.877
Charge the paddles. Carter, CPR!

19:21.089 --> 19:22.667
What do you think it is?

19:22.841 --> 19:27.052
Probably high potassium.
Give an amp of calcium. Clear!

19:28.596 --> 19:30.220
- Still V-fib.
- Three hundred.

19:30.430 --> 19:33.633
- Insulin and glucose?
- And an amp of bicarb.

19:33.850 --> 19:35.474
- Paddles ready.
- Clear!

19:38.938 --> 19:41.392
- Nothing.
-360. Stand by with epi.

19:41.606 --> 19:42.768
Come on, hurry up.

19:44.108 --> 19:45.650
Okay, clear!

19:47.027 --> 19:48.604
I'll be right there.

19:48.820 --> 19:50.480
- What?
- Carol's in labor.

19:50.697 --> 19:53.022
- She in the hospital?
- I may miss it.

19:53.241 --> 19:56.027
- Who's Carol?
- Our friend. We gotta go.

19:56.202 --> 19:59.285
- Why?
- Well, I'm the Lamaze coach.

19:59.496 --> 20:03.789
- Where's the father?
- Let's go. I'll drop you guys off.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.708
- I'm hungry!
- Me too!

20:05.877 --> 20:08.414
- We might as well eat.
- Could be awhile.

20:08.629 --> 20:10.087
I can drive them home.

20:10.297 --> 20:14.709
- Are you okay with this?
- She's fine. Go coach, we'll eat.

20:14.926 --> 20:18.341
Here, take a biscuit.
Call with all the details.

20:18.553 --> 20:20.712
- Boys, girls, weight.
- You're sure?

20:20.889 --> 20:22.845
Carol needs you. We'll be fine.

20:23.057 --> 20:25.761
If they give you trouble,
lock them up.

20:26.477 --> 20:31.103
- No turkey for me. Animal fat's bad.
- Not today.

20:31.440 --> 20:32.898
Push, push, push!

20:33.108 --> 20:37.437
- Good job, Carol! Almost there!
- I see the head. Crowning.

20:37.653 --> 20:40.144
- Keep breathing.
- Contraction subsiding.

20:40.364 --> 20:43.530
- I want you to push hard.
- I'm trying!

20:43.741 --> 20:47.573
Come on. Come on.
Ten, nine, eight, seven-

20:47.787 --> 20:51.997
- Count faster!
- Six, five, four, three-

20:52.207 --> 20:54.163
- Okay, just relax.
- Is he out?

20:54.375 --> 20:58.668
- Not yet. Next contraction.
- You're doing great. Almost there.

20:58.879 --> 21:01.548
- Did you want natural birth?
- Hell, no!

21:01.756 --> 21:03.131
- Pedes?
- I paged them.

21:03.341 --> 21:06.757
- Better get Cleo in here.
- Details on twin A.

21:06.928 --> 21:08.920
What? No, let me see.

21:09.137 --> 21:12.838
Have L and D bring
a vacuum extraction-

21:13.058 --> 21:14.516
Vacuum?! No!

21:14.726 --> 21:17.726
Look at me, honey.
It's just for safety.

21:17.936 --> 21:22.432
The baby's heart rate is down to 90.
But we're okay over 80.

21:22.607 --> 21:25.145
- Okay.
- Okay, good.

21:25.360 --> 21:28.775
- Let's go with a scalp electrode.
- Do you have to?

21:28.946 --> 21:31.436
It gives me more accurate monitoring.

21:31.656 --> 21:35.949
Rest up. In two minutes
you're gonna push this baby out.

21:42.791 --> 21:44.948
- How much atropine?
- Two amps.

21:45.126 --> 21:47.249
- The last epi?
- Five minutes.

21:47.462 --> 21:48.920
Let's check the rhythm.

21:50.381 --> 21:52.124
Asystole.

21:52.966 --> 21:54.246
That's it.

21:54.467 --> 21:57.503
Time of death: 1317.

21:59.971 --> 22:01.845
Happy birthday.

22:02.057 --> 22:04.262
- You got it.
- Five...

22:04.475 --> 22:05.969
- How close?
- She's there.

22:06.185 --> 22:10.478
- Fetal rate is 85.
- Okay, the head's out! Bulb suction.

22:10.647 --> 22:14.940
- Carol, don't push, honey.
- Is the cord around its neck?

22:16.986 --> 22:18.480
Not anymore.

22:21.365 --> 22:22.931
All right. Here we go.

22:39.882 --> 22:41.710
Say hello to your daughter.

22:42.476 --> 22:44.932
- It's a girl?
- Yes.

22:45.146 --> 22:47.637
- It's a girl.
- Congratulations.

22:47.857 --> 22:50.774
Hi. Hello.

22:51.903 --> 22:54.109
Let's check twin B's presentation.

22:54.322 --> 22:58.949
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Looks like about six pounds.

22:59.161 --> 23:01.403
- She's so little.
- So little.

23:01.580 --> 23:03.739
But that's a good size for a twin.

23:04.708 --> 23:07.080
I have to take her. Take a good look.

23:07.252 --> 23:09.328
- She's healthy?
- She's beautiful.

23:11.090 --> 23:14.091
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

23:15.178 --> 23:16.921
Okay.

23:18.264 --> 23:19.344
There we go.

23:21.518 --> 23:23.760
Have you picked a name yet?

23:25.522 --> 23:28.773
Tess. I think I'm gonna name her Tess.

23:29.943 --> 23:32.435
Welcome to the world, Tess.

23:36.158 --> 23:37.617
There we go.

23:44.292 --> 23:45.870
You did great.

24:06.399 --> 24:08.308
Carol Hathaway?

24:08.526 --> 24:12.654
I'm Abby. I'll be your OB nurse.
Heard about the excitement.

24:12.864 --> 24:15.486
Second twin is vertex and high.

24:15.659 --> 24:19.526
- Just relax, Carol. Is the bag intact?
- Yes.

24:19.746 --> 24:24.788
I'm Sandra. I have to tag you both
before I take her to the nursery.

24:24.960 --> 24:25.991
Can't she stay?

24:26.211 --> 24:29.248
We'll bring her back
after the other one's here.

24:29.465 --> 24:32.798
- What if she gets hungry?
- We can supplement.

24:32.968 --> 24:34.000
- Sure?
- Yes, I am.

24:34.220 --> 24:35.679
I need you to scoot over.

24:35.847 --> 24:37.471
Nice and easy.

24:37.682 --> 24:39.390
There we go.

24:40.268 --> 24:43.020
Kerry, could you go with her?

24:43.230 --> 24:45.187
Sure. I'll get her settled in.

24:45.399 --> 24:48.104
- Thanks.
- Three-five-one-six-four.

24:48.319 --> 24:50.311
Three-five-one-six-four. All set.

24:50.529 --> 24:51.858
Say bye-bye, Mommy.

24:52.406 --> 24:55.857
Bye, honey, bye. Thanks, Kerry.

24:57.495 --> 24:59.618
Are the contractions still strong?

24:59.830 --> 25:01.871
They're spaced out. But yeah.

25:02.042 --> 25:05.541
We'll do an ultrasound.
But it could take a while.

25:05.712 --> 25:07.503
Is Dr. McLucas on her way?

25:07.714 --> 25:09.623
Yes. Do you want an epidural?

25:09.841 --> 25:12.214
- I can still have one?
- Absolutely.

25:12.427 --> 25:16.556
- If I wasn't sure before, I am now.
- Wimp.

25:18.183 --> 25:21.220
- Mark.
- Heard I missed the party.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.891
- Oh, God.
- I'll call the anesthesiologist.

25:25.107 --> 25:27.433
- A girl?
- A girl.

25:27.652 --> 25:29.478
Troublemaker already?

25:29.779 --> 25:32.484
- You're hanging in there?
- It's brutal.

25:33.992 --> 25:37.575
- One down, one to go.
- I quit.

25:38.372 --> 25:42.370
- You don't have a choice.
- Well, you could shoot me.

25:42.585 --> 25:44.577
Yeah, if it comes to that.

25:44.921 --> 25:48.372
Sorry to pull you away
from your Thanksgiving.

25:48.758 --> 25:50.715
I'd rather be here.

25:50.927 --> 25:56.088
D- Day. Five beaches.
The Americans take Utah...

25:56.266 --> 25:57.511
Here.

25:58.101 --> 26:01.600
The potatoes. And Omaha, the squash.

26:01.813 --> 26:05.515
Now, the Brits land here
and share Juno...

26:06.568 --> 26:10.020
- ... the stuffing, with the Canucks.
- Canucks?

26:10.238 --> 26:12.232
- The Canadians.
- Right.

26:12.449 --> 26:14.987
- Are you with me?
- Yes, I'm with you.

26:15.202 --> 26:19.449
The German resistance
is concentrated on the American lines.

26:19.624 --> 26:24.416
Massive casualties are suffered
by the Americans that day, 6000.

26:24.629 --> 26:26.207
The Brits had their share.

26:26.422 --> 26:29.424
- The gravy goes with the potatoes.
- Fine.

26:30.511 --> 26:34.972
Instead of cutting off the Germans
at Caen, Montgomery...

26:35.140 --> 26:37.596
- ... the British general-
- I know.

26:37.810 --> 26:42.306
- He sat on his ass and had tea.
- I'm going to the bathroom.

26:43.232 --> 26:46.767
The British fought the Germans
before the Americans.

26:46.986 --> 26:49.145
Perhaps they were more cautious.

26:49.364 --> 26:54.073
- Cautious is one word for it.
- I guess "tea-loving" is another.

26:54.286 --> 26:56.325
That's two words.

26:56.705 --> 26:59.493
It's a hyphenate, actually.

27:00.417 --> 27:02.825
Anyway, the 82nd Airborne Division-

27:03.045 --> 27:04.919
Do you have to use a cath?

27:05.130 --> 27:08.547
- You won't control your urine.
- Great.

27:08.760 --> 27:13.506
- Sorry, no catheter, no epidural.
- Seems like a small price to pay.

27:13.682 --> 27:15.306
It's not your bladder.

27:15.517 --> 27:16.892
Are we doing this?

27:17.102 --> 27:18.975
- Carol?
- Yes.

27:19.187 --> 27:21.560
All right. All set.

27:21.773 --> 27:23.600
Carol, you have to sit up.

27:23.817 --> 27:27.234
- Can't we do it on my side?
- It's better upright.

27:27.446 --> 27:30.531
- I'm a nurse. Why?
- To get a clear shot.

27:30.741 --> 27:33.862
You don't want him fishing around.
Up you go.

27:34.079 --> 27:36.036
Get it right the first time.

27:36.206 --> 27:38.910
I generally do
if the patient cooperates.

27:39.125 --> 27:40.536
- Mark?
- Yeah.

27:40.752 --> 27:42.211
Grab her other shoulder.

27:42.379 --> 27:46.626
Okay, lean into us. A little bit more.
Keep your back round.

27:47.301 --> 27:50.218
And you'll feel a little prick.

27:51.054 --> 27:54.555
Carol Hathaway? Carol, it's you.

27:54.766 --> 27:56.012
Dr. Coburn.

27:56.686 --> 28:01.348
- I had no idea. Congratulations.
- No, he's my Lamaze coach.

28:02.567 --> 28:05.058
- How're we doing?
- Six centimeters.

28:05.278 --> 28:08.149
- Six?
- You shrink between deliveries.

28:08.364 --> 28:10.737
I know. But six?

28:11.910 --> 28:14.318
- Need more local?
- No, contraction.

28:14.538 --> 28:16.531
Just hold on. You're doing great.

28:16.832 --> 28:18.908
Dr. McLucas is in Wichita.

28:19.126 --> 28:21.877
She asked me to cover.
Is that all right?

28:22.087 --> 28:23.286
I gotta lie down.

28:23.506 --> 28:25.795
He's in the middle of it. Hold still.

28:26.009 --> 28:27.966
- No, I can't!
- Yes, you can.

28:28.178 --> 28:31.593
Hold my hand, okay?
You're gonna feel much better.

28:31.806 --> 28:33.633
- It hurts, Mark.
- I know.

28:33.850 --> 28:36.258
No, I mean, it really hurts.

28:36.436 --> 28:40.766
I know. I know.
Hang in there. Hang in there.

28:40.983 --> 28:43.735
One night Stu and I were on deck.

28:44.528 --> 28:49.106
He asked me for a light.
And when I looked up, he was gone.

28:50.326 --> 28:54.276
- What do you mean, gone?
- Gone. He'd fallen overboard.

28:54.497 --> 28:56.121
My God! Did he drown?

28:56.290 --> 28:58.366
If the fall didn't kill him.

28:58.835 --> 29:00.958
- That's terrible.
- Yeah.

29:01.129 --> 29:05.043
Worse than the working conditions
was the food.

29:05.258 --> 29:07.796
Probably took more men than anything.

29:08.011 --> 29:10.300
You mean worse than the English?

29:11.682 --> 29:12.963
I was kidding.

29:13.184 --> 29:16.387
I haven't had
a meal like this since...

29:17.730 --> 29:20.482
Well, for a while.

29:21.484 --> 29:24.604
- Since your wife died?
- Yeah.

29:24.821 --> 29:27.822
I can only imagine
how difficult it must be.

29:27.991 --> 29:31.443
- As difficult as you make it.
- What do you mean?

29:32.829 --> 29:36.779
How's Mark?
You know, dealing with it?

29:37.000 --> 29:41.248
In his stride, I suppose.
He doesn't speak of it much.

29:41.463 --> 29:44.915
And I've learnt not
to force the subject.

29:45.134 --> 29:48.918
Certain things he carries inside.
You must know that.

29:49.139 --> 29:52.342
His mother was the only one
who understood him.

29:53.017 --> 29:56.517
- He's not a mystery.
- Well, he's a good man.

29:56.730 --> 30:00.265
It's just that with Ruth gone...

30:03.946 --> 30:05.321
I don't know.

30:07.658 --> 30:10.529
- How about some pie?
- With his mother gone...?

30:12.998 --> 30:14.706
Nothing.

30:15.250 --> 30:17.373
Just seem to have lost a bridge.

30:17.544 --> 30:19.620
- A bridge?
- Yeah.

30:21.340 --> 30:23.831
Maybe you both just miss her.

30:28.431 --> 30:29.509
I'll get plates.

30:31.142 --> 30:34.059
Rachel, come get pie. What's with her?

30:34.270 --> 30:37.556
- She's been in there a half hour.
- I'll check.

30:40.651 --> 30:45.528
Rachel? Are you all right in there?

30:45.740 --> 30:47.069
Rachel?

30:48.994 --> 30:52.030
- Rachel, are you in there?
- Go away!

30:57.253 --> 31:00.752
- What are you looking for?
- I don't know.

31:03.509 --> 31:04.541
Am I boring you?

31:05.928 --> 31:08.217
No! No.

31:08.932 --> 31:11.602
- You wanna just talk?
- Sure.

31:12.310 --> 31:13.971
Okay.

31:14.729 --> 31:17.731
- What do you wanna talk about?
- I don't know.

31:18.567 --> 31:20.441
Hey, the post-game show's on.

31:23.323 --> 31:26.442
- How are you?
- In love with the epidural man.

31:26.659 --> 31:28.201
The anesthesiologist.

31:28.411 --> 31:31.282
He'll always be
the epidural man to me.

31:31.498 --> 31:33.953
I'm just gonna go get a magazine.

31:34.126 --> 31:37.079
Oh, I should call Elizabeth too.

31:37.295 --> 31:40.546
- Probably on a ledge.
- Could you call my mom?

31:40.757 --> 31:44.625
- What do I say?
- What you said. One down, one to go.

31:45.471 --> 31:48.009
Her number's in my organizer
in my bag.

31:48.432 --> 31:49.713
Anybody else?

31:52.019 --> 31:54.937
- No, not yet.
- Are you sure?

31:55.982 --> 31:58.224
I wanna get through this first.

32:00.069 --> 32:01.612
All right.

32:04.282 --> 32:06.987
- What's wrong?
- Just lost the signal.

32:07.160 --> 32:09.486
- Where'd it go?
- Hold on.

32:11.832 --> 32:15.451
Sandra, call Dr. Coburn
and bring the ultrasound.

32:15.669 --> 32:17.746
- Right there.
- Got it.

32:19.799 --> 32:21.127
Above the umbilicus.

32:21.342 --> 32:23.834
- What?
- Baby could be rotating.

32:24.262 --> 32:26.504
It's fine. Heart rate's 140.

32:26.723 --> 32:28.680
- Do we have an O.R.?
- I'll see.

32:29.976 --> 32:33.097
Wait, I don't need a C-section, do I?

32:33.314 --> 32:37.810
If the baby turns breech,
we'll have to labor you in the O.R.

32:39.069 --> 32:40.481
It's just a precaution.

32:41.864 --> 32:43.109
Oh, man.

32:49.705 --> 32:53.371
Is she sticking her finger
down her throat?

32:53.752 --> 32:57.702
I'm afraid she's having
her first menstrual period.

32:57.923 --> 32:59.333
Menstrual...?

33:00.926 --> 33:02.124
She's 10.

33:02.344 --> 33:06.009
It can happen at that age.
It's early, but normal.

33:06.223 --> 33:10.766
One of us needs to go to the store.
Do you want to stay with her?

33:11.312 --> 33:13.388
What do you need from the store?

33:13.606 --> 33:15.017
Sanitary napkins.

33:16.401 --> 33:18.477
You don't have that stuff?

33:20.447 --> 33:24.575
I only have tampons.
It's not the best for a young girl.

33:25.077 --> 33:27.153
Oh, right.

33:28.497 --> 33:30.739
There's a drugstore on the corner.

33:30.916 --> 33:35.128
- Sanitary napkins. The flat ones?
- Ask the clerk.

33:38.299 --> 33:40.256
What if he's a guy?

33:42.220 --> 33:43.251
How're we doing?

33:43.430 --> 33:47.095
We'll move her right after
this contraction.

33:48.227 --> 33:51.097
- What's this for?
- We have to prep you for O.R.

33:51.313 --> 33:55.476
- Even if I'm not being operated on?
- I won't take pictures.

33:57.612 --> 34:01.146
- What is it?
- I think my water just broke again.

34:01.950 --> 34:06.363
Sure did. Nice and clear.
We'll clean you up once you-

34:06.580 --> 34:08.286
- What?
- Fetal heart rate's 90.

34:08.456 --> 34:11.540
- I have to check you.
- But we're good till 80?

34:11.751 --> 34:14.955
- I have to check you.
- What're you looking for?

34:15.172 --> 34:18.790
- I have to wait for this contraction.
- Seventy-five.

34:19.009 --> 34:21.714
- What's wrong?
- Damn it! Prolapsed cord.

34:21.929 --> 34:24.136
The cord gets out before the baby.

34:24.348 --> 34:27.136
- Cutting off the oxygen?
- Stat page Coburn.

34:27.309 --> 34:30.594
Heart rate's 65.
We have to get this baby out.

34:30.813 --> 34:34.562
- Only six centimeters.
- We have to crash C-section.

34:34.775 --> 34:37.813
- The O.R.'s not clear yet.
- We're going.

34:38.362 --> 34:41.068
- What-?
- Keeping the baby off its cord.

34:41.282 --> 34:43.074
This isn't happening.

34:43.284 --> 34:45.572
- Stay calm.
- Don't let this happen!

34:45.786 --> 34:48.324
- Don't worry, I'm right here.
- Oh, God!

34:51.210 --> 34:54.708
- What's the heart rate?
- We're not on a monitor.

34:54.922 --> 34:57.164
- What happened?
- Prolapsed cord.

34:57.383 --> 34:59.921
- Scrub in, Abby.
- She's got the cord.

35:00.136 --> 35:02.295
- I've got it.
- Don't let go!

35:02.514 --> 35:04.305
- Do you want to assist?
- No.

35:04.516 --> 35:07.221
Then I need for her to scrub in.

35:07.728 --> 35:12.057
Okay, everybody, on my count.
Nice and easy. One, two, three.

35:12.274 --> 35:15.228
- Get your hand on that cord.
- Save the baby.

35:15.402 --> 35:17.063
- No, promise me.
- I promise.

35:17.237 --> 35:19.526
- I got it.
- Let's prep her fast.

35:19.740 --> 35:21.532
- Where's Anesthesia?
- Got paged.

35:21.742 --> 35:25.741
- Get Anesthesia down here now!
- There's no time.

35:25.914 --> 35:30.243
- Keep 100 mics of fentanyl near by.
- I'll monitor her vitals.

35:31.085 --> 35:32.711
Please save this baby.

35:32.922 --> 35:34.795
- Gloves, now.
- Please.

35:35.007 --> 35:37.676
Okay, Mom's BP 118 over 84.

35:37.884 --> 35:40.376
Pulse 102. Satting 98 on room air.

35:40.596 --> 35:43.383
- Okay, nasal oxygen.
- I'm on it.

35:43.933 --> 35:47.765
Here we go.
One minute from skin to baby. Scalpel.

35:49.772 --> 35:53.687
There's skin. And mark the time.

35:53.901 --> 35:55.811
- Please, God.
- Don't worry.

35:56.029 --> 35:57.903
- Abby, pull.
- I'm pulling.

35:58.114 --> 36:00.902
- Someone working on Pedes?
- On their way.

36:01.118 --> 36:04.119
Retract inferiorally. Scalpel again.

36:05.122 --> 36:09.831
Uterine incision. Okay.
And another stretch.

36:10.044 --> 36:12.796
- Pediatrician's here.
- What's happening?

36:12.964 --> 36:14.624
- I see the baby.
- Blue towel.

36:16.843 --> 36:20.046
- Looks like a girl.
- You hear that? A girl.

36:20.263 --> 36:21.888
- Is she okay?
- Hold on.

36:22.099 --> 36:25.966
Second shoulder. Head flexed.

36:26.144 --> 36:27.224
Another clamp.

36:27.438 --> 36:29.810
- Is she out?
- She's out.

36:30.733 --> 36:32.274
- She's not crying.
- She will.

36:32.484 --> 36:34.276
- I got her.
- She looks okay.

36:34.486 --> 36:36.230
She's not crying.

36:36.406 --> 36:37.436
Blow by 15 liters.

36:37.657 --> 36:39.815
- Fifty-one seconds.
- She's blue.

36:40.243 --> 36:43.078
- She'll pink up.
- Uterus is boggy.

36:43.288 --> 36:45.115
- What's the Apgar?
- Don't worry.

36:45.332 --> 36:49.246
- What is it?
- Five-minute Apgar's more predictive.

36:52.006 --> 36:55.339
- My God! What happened?
- Damn ice. I slipped.

36:55.509 --> 36:58.083
- It was a pretty bad spill.
- Let me see.

36:58.304 --> 37:01.056
I'm fine.
You should throw salt out there.

37:01.265 --> 37:02.759
Do you know the time?

37:02.975 --> 37:06.843
Yeah, time my granddaughter
started her period.

37:07.063 --> 37:10.267
- You got this?
- Yes, thanks for buzzing me.

37:10.775 --> 37:13.348
We need to go to hospital
and stitch that.

37:13.570 --> 37:16.357
Like hell! It'll stop bleeding.

37:16.531 --> 37:20.944
- You need sutures and a tetanus shot.
- I need a Band-Aid and a drink.

37:21.161 --> 37:24.032
If you sit still,
you'll get a lollipop.

37:25.165 --> 37:28.083
Five-minute Apgar is eight, Carol.

37:28.294 --> 37:29.574
Can I see her?

37:29.795 --> 37:32.880
We've got active bleeding.
What's her pressure?

37:33.049 --> 37:34.793
Hundred over 60.

37:35.385 --> 37:37.342
- What took so long?
- Just paged me.

37:37.554 --> 37:41.053
She delivered five minutes ago.
Profuse bleeding.

37:41.224 --> 37:43.894
- How much Pitocin?
- Forty units in.

37:44.061 --> 37:46.303
- Another 0.2 Methergine.
- I.M.?

37:46.522 --> 37:50.222
I'll do it intramyometrial.
Hemostat. More suction.

37:50.735 --> 37:52.394
She's oozing everywhere.

37:52.611 --> 37:55.067
Sponge stick. Check another pressure.

37:56.490 --> 37:59.824
Oh, my God! I'm bleeding out.

38:01.746 --> 38:05.660
It always looks like more.
How are we doing?

38:06.084 --> 38:09.288
Pressure's down 80 over 40.

38:09.505 --> 38:12.209
All right, let's pump in some saline.

38:12.424 --> 38:15.794
- I wanna see my baby.
- You will. Just a little while.

38:16.012 --> 38:17.256
I'll take her.

38:18.055 --> 38:19.086
We're at 70.

38:19.306 --> 38:21.595
She needs blood. Type for four.

38:21.767 --> 38:24.685
Okay. Three liters are up.

38:25.397 --> 38:27.436
- Hemabate?
- Point-two-five I.M.

38:28.483 --> 38:31.769
- Blood's here in 10 minutes.
- We don't have that.

38:32.196 --> 38:35.861
- Open a hysterectomy tray.
- Hold on. Are we there yet?

38:36.074 --> 38:38.613
Carol, your uterus is atonic.

38:38.786 --> 38:41.360
You're losing a lot of blood.

38:41.580 --> 38:44.451
- No hysterectomy.
- We may have no choice.

38:44.625 --> 38:47.876
- Don't, please. Mark.
- What else can we do?

38:48.088 --> 38:50.792
Uterus still boggy.
Another 500 cc's lost.

38:50.965 --> 38:53.539
- Bovie.
- There must be something else.

38:53.760 --> 38:56.595
- Losing her.
- Clamp off an artery?

38:56.805 --> 38:59.130
- Step out.
- It's only 30 seconds.

38:59.349 --> 39:01.426
It's 30 seconds she may not have.

39:01.644 --> 39:05.593
She's a nurse.
She understands the risk.

39:07.650 --> 39:10.735
- O'Leary stitch. O-vicryl.
- O-neg is up.

39:10.945 --> 39:13.104
- Hold the transfusion.
- Pressure?

39:13.322 --> 39:16.109
- Systolic is 80.
- Cycle the dynamap.

39:16.325 --> 39:19.031
- That's a hypogastric.
- She lost 3 liters.

39:19.245 --> 39:22.579
- Needle driver.
- Hang in there, Carol.

39:41.853 --> 39:43.477
She needs a name.

39:44.564 --> 39:47.767
Tess needs to know
what her sister's name is.

39:48.693 --> 39:50.022
Is she all right?

39:50.195 --> 39:53.529
She's perfect. They are both perfect.

39:55.993 --> 39:57.024
What happened?

39:58.120 --> 40:01.037
You gave us a scare.
But you toughed it out.

40:03.959 --> 40:06.332
Yeah, you still have your uterus.

40:08.673 --> 40:10.998
You're up. How are you feeling?

40:11.217 --> 40:12.676
Little groggy.

40:12.885 --> 40:16.718
- Any pain?
- No, for the first time today.

40:16.890 --> 40:20.555
Drugs. Enjoy them while they last.

40:21.394 --> 40:23.720
I wouldn't repeat this, but...

40:24.398 --> 40:26.806
...you owe him your future children.

40:27.944 --> 40:32.238
They both came out so well,
you should think about doing it again.

40:32.407 --> 40:34.198
I'll get right on that.

40:34.659 --> 40:36.237
So, what's her name?

40:38.121 --> 40:40.577
- You wanna name her?
- Me?

40:42.751 --> 40:46.085
- What was your mom's name?
- Ruth.

40:48.048 --> 40:49.590
Middle name Katherine.

40:50.176 --> 40:53.212
Kate? I like that.

40:53.971 --> 40:55.086
Kate.

41:00.269 --> 41:02.807
- They need you downstairs.
- What for?

41:03.022 --> 41:05.596
They brought your dad
for a laceration.

41:05.984 --> 41:07.015
What happened?

41:07.235 --> 41:10.984
I don't know. I'll be right back.

41:13.950 --> 41:15.114
Mark?

41:18.413 --> 41:20.739
- Thank you.
- You did good, Mom.

41:27.298 --> 41:29.623
Can you call long-distance on this?

41:29.842 --> 41:33.177
You'll need a calling card.
Where are you calling?

41:33.722 --> 41:35.181
Seattle.

41:37.643 --> 41:39.600
- You come in handy.
- Thank you.

41:39.812 --> 41:42.303
- How many stitches?
- Maybe seven.

41:42.481 --> 41:44.273
- Dad, what happened?
- Nothing.

41:44.442 --> 41:45.472
He slipped on ice.

41:45.651 --> 41:48.486
I would've caught myself
but I had a big bag.

41:48.654 --> 41:51.691
How many kinds of sanitary
napkins are there?

41:51.908 --> 41:53.699
- Thin, maxi, mini...
- What?

41:53.910 --> 41:55.653
- Rachel got her period.
- What?

41:55.870 --> 41:59.915
- I had to buy every kind.
- Hold on. Can I talk to you?

42:00.125 --> 42:02.248
Couldn't just have regular.

42:04.171 --> 42:05.334
Rachel had her period?

42:05.506 --> 42:07.914
- I was surprised too.
- Where is she?

42:08.133 --> 42:11.337
On the phone with her mom.
She wants to go back.

42:11.554 --> 42:15.468
- Why'd you let him go?
- I should've left him with her?

42:15.683 --> 42:20.096
Dr. Greene? Did Carol Hathaway
have the other baby?

42:20.313 --> 42:21.855
- Yes.
- And what was it?

42:22.023 --> 42:25.024
- A girl. Two girls.
- Everything's all right?

42:25.193 --> 42:28.314
- Everything's fine now.
- Good. Thank you.

42:28.863 --> 42:32.364
You stitch up your father.
I'm gonna say hello.

42:34.411 --> 42:36.155
I like her.

42:38.541 --> 42:42.752
Sometimes you have to tickle her feet.
New babies are sleepy.

42:43.129 --> 42:46.214
Wait till she opens
her mouth really wide.

42:47.258 --> 42:48.587
That's it.

42:48.885 --> 42:51.340
Make sure her mouth covers the areola.

42:52.431 --> 42:54.719
See her little jaw moving?

42:55.225 --> 42:58.641
- Oh, she's a barracuda.
- She's a natural.

43:00.230 --> 43:03.397
Listen for the swallowing.
Do you hear it?

43:07.530 --> 43:11.196
I have to go.
Your postpartum nurse will take over.

43:11.409 --> 43:15.028
- You're leaving?
- You'll be fine. Congratulations.

43:15.789 --> 43:18.410
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

43:18.750 --> 43:20.826
You were very brave.

43:21.586 --> 43:25.204
- I don't know about that.
- Oh, trust me.

43:26.383 --> 43:28.376
- Good night.
- Good night.

43:28.594 --> 43:31.881
- Happy Thanksgiving!
- Happy Thanksgiving.
