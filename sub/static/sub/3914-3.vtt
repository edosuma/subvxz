11:02.579 --> 11:05.571
Thatsounded
totally sincere,
thank you.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.163
How about this?

11:08.251 --> 11:09.457
Your partners are
heading to Leith.

11:09.586 --> 11:10.996
Get me a seat on
Lucy when they do.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.247
Why do you need
my help for that?

11:12.380 --> 11:14.792
Because Dutch doesn't like me
and she'll say no if I ask.
(CHUCKLES)

11:15.091 --> 11:17.753
Get me a ride,
help me pick up
supplies at the Bazaar,

11:17.886 --> 11:21.378
and lwill sign
that psych eval
for you when we're back.

11:21.472 --> 11:22.552
Deal?

11:23.099 --> 11:24.885
I'll talk to John,
make it happen.

11:24.976 --> 11:26.056
Good.

11:29.606 --> 11:32.097
Do you want some
pain meds for your head?

11:35.278 --> 11:37.690
Actually, you
got any, um...

11:37.780 --> 11:40.112
Copazenol?
It helps me sleep.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.483
I'm all out.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.085
FOREMAN: All right,
new pickers,
welcome to the farm.

11:54.172 --> 11:56.003
Behave yourselves there,
work hard...
OVERSEER: Right there.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.793
...you'll leave here with
a year's worth of Joy.

11:57.884 --> 11:59.169
Move it up.

11:59.302 --> 12:00.417
Next!

12:00.511 --> 12:01.591
What is that?

12:01.679 --> 12:02.930
lt's insurance.

12:03.014 --> 12:04.629
So you're not tempted
to overstay your visa.

12:05.516 --> 12:06.551
(GROANS)

12:07.560 --> 12:08.970
Move. Next!

12:09.812 --> 12:11.518
FOREMAN: You work sun up
to sun down. No excuses.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.438
DUTCH: So, Johnny got himself
in as a migrant worker.

12:18.529 --> 12:20.440
Should be settled on
Martell's farm by now.

12:20.531 --> 12:21.907
Should be?
Farm rules.

12:22.408 --> 12:25.115
Data blackout
for all migrants,
so he deactivated his com.

12:25.203 --> 12:27.740
Well, I looked into
this Martell fella's shop.

12:27.830 --> 12:28.956
Looks clean.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.326
No workers AWOL
for six seasons.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.959
But a whole lot
of farm accidents
and work-related deaths.

12:35.046 --> 12:36.752
Probably self-inflicted.

12:36.839 --> 12:39.831
l'd kill myself if
I had to farm all day.
(LAUGHS)

12:40.426 --> 12:41.757
The cover you wanted.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.835
Won't stand up to
much poking around,

12:43.930 --> 12:45.795
but this warrant ain't
worth my extra effort.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.050
You sure it's worth yours?

12:47.183 --> 12:49.048
Seems to mean
a lot to Johnny.
Why?

12:49.686 --> 12:52.678
DUTCH: Ever since his
brother showed up,
John’s been off his game.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.637
He needs a win.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.348
So, John’s looking low
and /’/I be looking high,

12:57.443 --> 12:59.855
as a Hokk distributor
working for The Nine.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.248
My lady.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.869
Bedros Martell.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.330
It's an honor to
have you as a guest
at my humble Hokkery.

13:20.425 --> 13:23.292
Not too humble, I hope,
or I'm wasting my time.

13:23.386 --> 13:24.717
We only import the best.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.886
l've prepared my
finest room for you.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.339
If there's anything I can do
to make your stay
more pleasurable...

13:29.434 --> 13:32.597
Fetch my luggage.
That would be a good start.

13:34.105 --> 13:35.140
(SCOFFS)

13:45.283 --> 13:46.523
You okay?

13:46.617 --> 13:48.949
This moon's just
too damn hot.

13:49.746 --> 13:50.906
Take it easy.

13:51.456 --> 13:52.491
Hey, Westy.

13:53.791 --> 13:55.247
Fresh off the transport, huh?

13:55.335 --> 13:56.791
How did you know?

13:56.919 --> 13:58.955
They don't pay us
to "take it easy."

13:59.088 --> 14:01.670
Yeah, well, I had
a drinking buddy
in Old Town that told me

14:01.758 --> 14:04.591
this was the farm to crew
if I ever wanted an easyjob
and fresh air.

14:04.677 --> 14:05.757
(SCOFFS)

14:06.095 --> 14:07.255
You know Vincent Sh'ao?

14:07.347 --> 14:09.508
'Cause I could
really kick his ass
right about now.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.927
They don't pay us
to talk, either.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.099
(GROANS)

14:14.354 --> 14:16.686
Hey, get up!
Or we'll dock
a day's wages!

14:17.940 --> 14:19.476
He needs water.

14:26.324 --> 14:27.985
Easy,easy,easy.

14:31.829 --> 14:35.788
Got ourselves a runner!
Activate the tracker!

14:37.377 --> 14:38.457
(GROANS)

14:42.006 --> 14:43.121
JOHN: What the hells?

14:44.550 --> 14:46.131
OVERSEER: New people,
pay attention.

14:46.803 --> 14:49.010
That is the kind of
accident that happens

14:49.138 --> 14:51.299
when you break
your work permit!

14:51.391 --> 14:52.801
Stay in the zone.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.678
Now, get back to work.

15:00.149 --> 15:02.060
What about "undercover"
didn't you understand?

15:02.193 --> 15:04.309
Calm down,
l was careful.

15:05.822 --> 15:06.811
Wow.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.151
Nice.

15:10.243 --> 15:11.528
You definitely
got the better gig.

15:12.203 --> 15:13.784
(SIGHS)
Gross.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.077
Please get off my bed.

15:15.164 --> 15:17.155
They make us sleep
on Hokk leaves.
Who does that?

15:17.250 --> 15:19.366
John, you smell like
Lucy's septic system,

15:19.502 --> 15:21.709
and that is 3,000 count
Qreshi delta linen.

15:21.838 --> 15:23.499
So, get off my bed.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.874
Tell me what
you've found.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.794
Not Vincent.

15:31.889 --> 15:34.596
But I did discover Martell's
innovative worker
retention program.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.057
Theyjam one of
these puppies into us.

15:37.687 --> 15:39.643
What's that?
Ow.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.721
It's an incendiary
tracking device.

15:41.858 --> 15:42.893
They remove it on
the transport home,

15:43.025 --> 15:45.812
but until then,
step out of the designated
zone and...

15:45.903 --> 15:47.689
(IMITATES EXPLOSION)

15:48.114 --> 15:49.274
That's great news.

15:49.365 --> 15:50.866
That I have a tracking bomb
in my ear? Thanks.

15:51.409 --> 15:52.865
That Vince has.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.488
Can you get into
whatever system

15:54.579 --> 15:56.285
Martell tracks
his migrants with?

15:56.372 --> 15:57.703
Why do you think
I'm here?

15:58.708 --> 16:01.415
To ruin my bed and
steal my bonbons?

16:01.544 --> 16:03.455
You know, you're
just role-playing
a Qreshi bitch, Dutch.

16:03.546 --> 16:04.877
You don't have
to actually be one.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.297
(BEEPS)

16:09.385 --> 16:11.216
JOHN: Can't get access.
lt's eye scan only.

16:11.721 --> 16:12.927
Then I'll get us an eye.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.596
Not literally.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.056
Meet me tonight.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.769
I need a minimum fifty doses.

16:22.899 --> 16:25.060
But I'll take more
if you're feeling generous.

16:25.151 --> 16:26.311
Sorry, I can't
help you.

16:26.402 --> 16:28.393
I'm just an herbalist.
PAWTER: Come on.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.695
We both know you sell
more than just herbs.

16:30.781 --> 16:33.067
You want Linaria root?
I can sell you that.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.239
Please.

16:34.327 --> 16:37.160
I'm losing 10 children
a month to Pleuroxis.
I need your help.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.537
Ask me, the best
thing for the Quad

16:39.624 --> 16:41.580
is fewer Westerlyns.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.785
Come on, we'll get it
somewhere else.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.622
(GROANS)
Have you heard
of Selius Fever?

16:48.758 --> 16:50.089
lt's nasty stuff.
Pawter.

16:50.176 --> 16:52.918
You want the inoculation?
Let's trade.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.343
D'AVIN: Nice try.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.049
Get the doctor
what she wants.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.259
Slowly.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.686
Not a word. Do it.

17:17.662 --> 17:18.993
Here.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.115
This will cleanse
your palate.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.953
Where did you get that?
The big house.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.375
You went inside?

17:26.462 --> 17:27.998
Why should they get
all the fancy stuff?

17:35.513 --> 17:36.548
(CHUCKLES)

17:38.724 --> 17:40.806
I haven't had real cocoa
since I was a child.

17:40.893 --> 17:41.973
Thank you.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.141
Mmm.

17:46.691 --> 17:49.854
So, what brings
you to Leith?

17:50.528 --> 17:54.487
Like I said, sun,
fresh air, Joy. The usual.

17:55.157 --> 17:57.148
You're not exactly
the usual.
I'm not?

17:57.243 --> 17:58.574
No.

17:58.661 --> 18:01.198
You're either really
brave or really dumb.

18:02.707 --> 18:05.244
Well, I don't want
to live in a world
where l have to choose.

18:07.211 --> 18:09.076
Seriously, why leave?

18:10.590 --> 18:13.502
I came to the Quad
on a stolen ship
with nothing in my pockets.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.425
The only place
that would take me
was Westerley.

18:16.512 --> 18:20.972
But I hate living there
and I definitely
don't want to die there.

18:21.058 --> 18:22.559
You're thinking
of running?

18:23.102 --> 18:25.639
Not after
what I saw today.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.015
Good.

18:27.565 --> 18:28.896
Running never works.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.895
Is that what
happened to Vince?

18:32.028 --> 18:34.861
He tried to run,
and now he's
fertilizing the Hokk?

18:35.698 --> 18:39.611
Well, if you know
Vincent, you'd know
he's smarter than that.

18:42.371 --> 18:43.986
Does your family
have much land left?

18:44.081 --> 18:45.457
On Qresh?

18:46.542 --> 18:48.043
By the time
my father was of age,

18:48.127 --> 18:49.742
most of it had submerged.

18:49.879 --> 18:51.289
He was the youngest,

18:51.380 --> 18:52.995
so he got a one-way
trip to Leith

18:53.090 --> 18:54.250
and a parcel of land.

18:55.217 --> 18:58.050
Which now produces
some of the finest
Hokk in the Quad.

18:58.596 --> 19:00.461
My investors are
very interested

19:00.598 --> 19:02.554
in importing ifthey
like what I see.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.803
Our Hokk recipe
is my invention.

19:05.895 --> 19:07.226
And I've dealt
with my share

19:07.313 --> 19:09.053
of swindlers and
spies along the way.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.639
Many thinking
themselves quite clever.

19:13.736 --> 19:17.445
But there's one thing
cleverness can't get you.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.068
Taste.

19:22.912 --> 19:23.947
Hmm.

19:24.955 --> 19:27.492
We'll start
with a young Shiro.

19:41.305 --> 19:44.217
Peppery, with hints
of citrus.

19:44.308 --> 19:47.800
And if I'm not
mistaken, vanilla.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.687
But this Shiro has been aged
at least two years.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.357
(CHUCKLES)
Two years, three months.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.696
Your palate
is refined, Seyah.

19:57.780 --> 20:00.237
As is my generous host.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.360
I'd never know
you for a Leithian.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.069
Shall we try
a vintage Gorudo?

20:07.164 --> 20:09.655
And waste a perfectly
good bottle?

20:11.210 --> 20:12.450
You're touching me.

20:12.670 --> 20:13.705
(CHUCKLES)

20:13.879 --> 20:17.371
Trust me. We'll have
more fun drinking this.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.922
Permission to
touch you, my lady.

20:27.017 --> 20:28.473
Granted.

20:34.316 --> 20:36.807
Permission to take
your clothes off.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.573
That's quite the burn.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.909
That? It's nothing.

20:56.172 --> 20:57.503
And what about
these bruises?

20:58.674 --> 21:00.414
Are they nothing?

21:00.509 --> 21:03.000
What highborn
Qreshi woman
has these scars?

21:05.264 --> 21:07.095
Feel that?

21:07.183 --> 21:09.094
That's from being
tied with bansa knots.

21:10.060 --> 21:12.437
And this is from
a long night and

21:12.521 --> 21:13.681
an even longer whip.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.347
We of The Nine
like to play rough.

21:18.861 --> 21:19.976
How rough?

to make a highborn

Have you ever experienced
a Qreshi two-hander?

21:41.801 --> 21:42.881
Show me.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.543

what the penalty is

idea what the penalty

I've been told that
by saner men than you,
D'avin Jaqobis.

22:53.289 --> 22:54.950
You knew you were
going to rob her.
You used me.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.746
Oh, right, like you
haven't been playing me?

22:56.834 --> 22:58.916
"I can buy you dinner.

"Look at my manly muscles.

"Please sign my psych form."

23:01.964 --> 23:04.421
All right,
all right. Guilty.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.999
Look, I really did
need those meds, okay?

23:07.136 --> 23:08.967
Pleuroxis was barely a cold
when I grew up on Qresh.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.430
On Westerley it's
a death sentence

23:10.514 --> 23:12.015
because no one can
afford the damn pills.

23:12.141 --> 23:13.972
Not okay.
So what took you
to Westerley?

23:14.059 --> 23:15.174
Need.

23:15.311 --> 23:16.926
As soon as people heard
there was a Doctor around,

23:17.021 --> 23:18.977
they started lining up,
and they haven't
stopped since.

23:20.190 --> 23:21.805
Westerlyns get
a raw deal in the Quad.

23:22.818 --> 23:24.729
I try and balance
it when I can.

23:26.488 --> 23:28.149
Your turn.
Why are you here?

23:28.324 --> 23:29.359
(FIRECRACKERS EXPLODING)

Yeah, we should
head back to Lucy.

No.

All right, Vincent.
Come out, come out,

24:44.900 --> 24:46.401
What do you think?

24:46.485 --> 24:50.819
Workers chopping and running,
or serial killer
with an ear fetish?

24:50.906 --> 24:53.613
Either way,
why hasn't Martell
reported them missing?

25:04.461 --> 25:05.576
Agreed.

25:06.380 --> 25:08.917
I'll call D'avin
in for backup.
Go with him at first light.

25:09.008 --> 25:12.125
D'avin, seriously?
l'm... l'm literally
standing right here.

25:12.219 --> 25:14.631
Your head will
literally go boom
ifyou leave the grounds.

25:14.722 --> 25:17.338
D'avin's standing by
at the Leith market.

25:17.933 --> 25:19.389
Fine.

25:19.476 --> 25:21.307
But I got in tight with
this migrant worker, Shyla.

25:21.395 --> 25:22.805
Now, lthink that she
knows what's going on.

25:22.896 --> 25:24.602
So just give me a day
to work that angle,

25:24.690 --> 25:26.055

No.

(SCOFFS)

25:27.860 --> 25:29.475
I'm sorry, are you
not letting me?

25:29.570 --> 25:31.526
Again, John, bomb
in your head.

25:31.613 --> 25:34.104
I don't want you painting
an unnecessary
target on yourself.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.905
D'avin and lwill
handle it, and
that's final.

Fearless, decisive.

to be a Killjoy.

I'm sorry,
I was doing myjob.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.121

You're on Westerley
the same reason
as the rest of us,

26:39.098 --> 26:40.213
'cause you have
nowhere to go.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.136
Nice. But you can't
drive me away that easy.

26:43.519 --> 26:45.555
The Company threatened
to suspend your

Killjoys have access to
all kinds of fun files.

Just doing myjob.

Like you said,
you're not a Killjoy.

26:57.783 --> 26:59.694
Not until I
sign off on you.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.619
I'll find my own ride home.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.671
Hey, brave and dumb.

27:15.342 --> 27:17.173
Still enjoying
the fresh air?

27:18.595 --> 27:20.051
Actually, ljust came
to say goodbye.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.219
What?

27:21.348 --> 27:22.428
Harvesting Hokk
isn't for me.

27:22.516 --> 27:24.222
We're not slaves.

27:24.309 --> 27:26.891
I can quit if I want,
as long as | go
straight back to Westerley.

27:28.438 --> 27:30.520
Yeah, and they
can make sure

27:30.607 --> 27:31.983
you don't see
a single Joy,

27:32.067 --> 27:34.183
and that you pay for
your transport back
out of your own pocket.

27:34.278 --> 27:36.769
Or lock you up for the debt.
Is that what you want?

27:39.658 --> 27:41.114
Okay, truth.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.324
I didn't come
here to pick Hokk.

27:43.412 --> 27:46.245
Now, Vince said there
was more to this place.
If he lied, then I'm gone.

27:46.331 --> 27:49.414
But if not, lwant in.

27:50.919 --> 27:52.125
Why are you telling me?

28:02.681 --> 28:05.218
Because I know
that you're involved.

28:06.310 --> 28:10.053
Now, whatever it is,
I'm ready for it.

You do this,
there's no coming back.

about something this morning.

and none of the other
workers have seen him.

l'm tracking his ear tag.

28:46.308 --> 28:47.343

28:47.434 --> 28:48.469
Oh, no.

Oh, Johnny Jaqobis,
tell me you didn't...

(GASPS)

29:04.493 --> 29:06.154
SHYLA: So, I came
to Leith, prepared

29:06.328 --> 29:08.034
to work myself into
an early grave.

29:09.122 --> 29:10.157
And I met Vincent

29:10.249 --> 29:11.534
and he showed
me a new way.

29:11.959 --> 29:14.496
So, you go back and
forth between the farm
and the forest?

29:14.586 --> 29:16.702
To find other
Westerlyns who refuse

29:16.797 --> 29:19.254
to be defined by
the world they
were born on.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.168
Or assigned to.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.091
People who have
what it takes.

29:23.929 --> 29:25.089
To do what?

29:25.180 --> 29:26.545
Follow me.

29:33.939 --> 29:36.146
Crazy, ear-chopping
son of a bitch.

29:36.233 --> 29:37.348

29:37.442 --> 29:38.522

29:42.406 --> 29:43.987
Easy, soldier.

29:44.491 --> 29:46.607
Stay ready,
but leave it with me.

30:00.966 --> 30:02.672
You mightwant
to put those down.

30:04.553 --> 30:07.260
And you might want
to tell me who the hell
you really are.

30:08.849 --> 30:11.465
Most Hokk
distributors I know

30:12.352 --> 30:14.729

Killjoy.

30:20.068 --> 30:21.478
On an official warrant.

I guess the migrant worker
that broke in here
and attacked you

30:24.114 --> 30:25.604
was too stupid
to know any better.

Where's the grow op?

31:52.577 --> 31:53.692
I could tell you,

31:53.829 --> 31:55.945
but you don't
want to go there.
And why's that?

31:56.039 --> 31:58.951
When you hacked my
system, lthought you
were here to bust me,

31:59.042 --> 32:02.000
so I contacted the
authorities and expressed
my absolute shock

32:02.087 --> 32:04.453
at finding a Jakk grow op
running under my nose.

32:04.548 --> 32:06.834
Plausible deniability, nice.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.005
How long do I have?

32:08.093 --> 32:10.379
Before the defoliation
ships arrive?

32:11.304 --> 32:13.340
In an hour that forest
will be a dead zone.

32:13.890 --> 32:17.348

your partner will be, too.

he knows you.
VINCENT: Oh, really?

the danger in
telling lies.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.427
Someone always
knows the truth.

So, unless you want
a bullet to the head,

you're going to
tell me who you are.

33:12.699 --> 33:14.314
I'm a Killjoy.

33:14.868 --> 33:17.985
I've got a warrant to take
you back to Westerley
before your visa expires.

33:18.079 --> 33:19.159
That is all.

33:19.789 --> 33:20.995
Who put out the warrant?

33:21.082 --> 33:22.162
N'oa, his wife.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.535
JOHN: You remember her?

33:24.669 --> 33:25.920
I didn't know
she cared so much.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.119
JOHN: She kind of has to.

33:27.214 --> 33:29.421
She co-signed
your work contract.

33:29.508 --> 33:30.918
If you go AWOL,
she does your time,

33:31.009 --> 33:32.294
and I'm not going
to let that happen.

33:32.385 --> 33:35.092
Yeah, well, I'm not
going back to Westerley.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.511
N'oa should have
made better choices.

33:37.599 --> 33:39.135
Now I've got to
get rid of you.

33:40.602 --> 33:42.558
You really don't
want to do that.

33:42.646 --> 33:43.761
The RAC will hunt you down.

33:43.855 --> 33:44.890
VINCENT: The RAC?

33:44.981 --> 33:47.893
By the time they
find your body,
I'll be long gone.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.354
You brought him in,
you put him down.

33:58.078 --> 33:59.113
Let's go.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.200
Get up.

34:03.291 --> 34:04.451
Up!

34:05.502 --> 34:07.367
Get here, D'avin.
Get here now.

34:07.462 --> 34:09.327
Hang in. Almost there.

34:10.507 --> 34:11.713
I'm sorry, John.

34:14.219 --> 34:15.459
I really am.

34:15.554 --> 34:16.714
You really should be.

I'm going after Vincent.

34:30.694 --> 34:32.525

Good.

34:32.612 --> 34:35.649

34:41.830 --> 34:44.822
There are other ships
heading to our destination.

34:46.251 --> 34:47.491
That's not good.

34:55.051 --> 34:56.211
Hey, Dutch.

34:57.137 --> 34:59.093
Where's D'avin?
What the hell
happened here?

34:59.180 --> 35:00.386
John Jaqobis happened.

35:00.473 --> 35:01.599

35:07.939 --> 35:10.271
Martell ratted
out the operation
to the authorities.

35:10.358 --> 35:11.564
Okay.

35:11.651 --> 35:13.027
I'm ready.

35:13.153 --> 35:15.018
You can take me home.
No.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.228
SHYLA: We stay and fight.

35:16.615 --> 35:18.480
We'll shoot at their ships,
drive them off.

35:18.575 --> 35:19.781
Buy enough time
to save the crop.

35:19.868 --> 35:21.404
lfyou stay, you die.
Come with us.

35:21.494 --> 35:25.453
Back to Old Town?
Prison? Go to hell.

35:25.540 --> 35:27.076
I fight for what's mine.

35:27.834 --> 35:31.452
You got a warrant for me,
not her. Take me.

35:31.546 --> 35:33.878
He's right, John.
If she wants to stay,
that's her choice.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.130
Have it your way.

35:45.935 --> 35:47.141
JOHN: Keep up, Vincent!

35:47.228 --> 35:48.638
D'AVIN: Those ships
are dropping payload.

35:48.730 --> 35:50.391
You got about 10 seconds.
Hustle!

35:50.482 --> 35:52.643
Ten, nine...
(ALARM BEEPING)

35:52.734 --> 35:54.395
JOHN: D'av, we can count.

35:55.111 --> 35:56.976
Vince, haul your ass!

35:58.365 --> 36:00.401
LUCY: Toxin dispersal
ship approaching.

36:01.409 --> 36:02.990
Get in. Come on.
(GRUNTS)

36:03.078 --> 36:04.488
Come on.

36:20.679 --> 36:23.261
VINCENT: Congratulations.
I’m back on Westerley.

36:23.348 --> 36:25.009
Your warrant's complete.

36:25.100 --> 36:27.307
You want to get
rid of these things?

36:33.441 --> 36:35.773
Thank you so much
for the ride.

36:35.860 --> 36:37.816
LUCY: John, your
guest has arrived.

36:37.904 --> 36:39.144
Much appreciated.

36:39.239 --> 36:40.274
Hmm.

36:41.783 --> 36:42.863
Vincent?

36:42.951 --> 36:44.816
N'oa. Baby.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.072
Oh.

36:48.790 --> 36:49.950
That was so close.

36:50.500 --> 36:51.580
N'OA: I missed you.

36:51.668 --> 36:53.158
Did you miss me?

36:53.253 --> 36:55.835
Are you kidding me?
I thought about
you every night.

36:56.339 --> 36:57.795
I owe you my life.

36:59.134 --> 37:00.169
(GROANS)

37:00.593 --> 37:02.845
I hope you think
about me every night
the next 10 years,

37:02.929 --> 37:05.671
you pathetic, wannabe,
planet-hopping ass.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.306
I like her.
N'OA: He's all yours, Johnny.

37:08.977 --> 37:10.012
Baby.

37:10.979 --> 37:12.389
Wait.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.515
Vincent Sh'ao,

37:14.149 --> 37:15.685
it gives me, well,
(LAUGHS)

37:15.775 --> 37:16.981
let's be honest,

37:17.068 --> 37:20.231
great pleasure to inform you
that you are so locked,

37:20.321 --> 37:22.061
and incredibly served.

37:22.741 --> 37:23.901
This is horseshit.

37:23.992 --> 37:26.654
Your warrant was to
bring me back here,
and I'm here!

37:26.745 --> 37:28.531
Unfortunately,
your off-world permit

37:28.621 --> 37:30.828
expired an hour outside
of Westerlyn air space.

37:32.333 --> 37:33.994
Johnny, did we take
the scenic route?

37:34.085 --> 37:35.325
We did.

37:36.129 --> 37:38.120
And I feel terrible
about that.

37:39.632 --> 37:42.089
See, the Company's
charged you with
illegal emigration.

37:44.763 --> 37:47.505
So have fun serving
your time at the
bottom of a mine.

37:47.807 --> 37:48.842
(CHUCKLES)

37:49.684 --> 37:51.925
You should have
made better choices.

37:53.188 --> 37:54.177
(GRUNTS)

37:59.903 --> 38:02.064
lfyou ask me,
it looks a little large.

38:02.197 --> 38:03.858
l'd shut up
before she takes off
your other ear.

38:03.948 --> 38:05.028
Yeah.

38:05.700 --> 38:07.611
It's going to be a while
before I can fit you in,

38:07.702 --> 38:11.240
so if I were you,
I would go get really,
really, really drunk.

38:11.748 --> 38:12.954
This is going
to hurt, isn't it?

38:14.626 --> 38:15.866
Yeah. Yeah.

38:16.920 --> 38:19.127
I'll come find
you when I'm ready.

38:21.758 --> 38:23.874
I know I'm supposed
to say something
to make things better.

38:25.428 --> 38:28.215
Say you're sorry.
You could start with that.

38:28.932 --> 38:30.217
I'm sorry.

38:31.226 --> 38:33.433
And for the record,
I don't care
why you left Qresh.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.176
lt's none
of my business.

38:35.271 --> 38:36.807
Do you like
living this way?

38:38.066 --> 38:39.146
No.

38:39.234 --> 38:41.600
Then do something
about it.

38:41.736 --> 38:43.601
D'avin, you don't add up.
You're taking Copazenol,

38:43.738 --> 38:44.898
you say to
help you sleep.

38:44.989 --> 38:47.480
But Copazenol
is a very strong
neurological medication.

38:49.077 --> 38:50.408
Who prescribed it to you?

38:50.578 --> 38:51.863
Some army doc.

38:51.996 --> 38:54.612
What was she
treating you for?
Honestly can't remember.

38:58.962 --> 38:59.997
Read it.

39:04.133 --> 39:05.168
You're passing me.

39:05.635 --> 39:08.092
Because we had a deal,
and I keep my word.

39:09.597 --> 39:11.178
Look, ifyou care
at all about yourself

39:11.266 --> 39:13.348
or your team,
you need to get help.

39:13.434 --> 39:15.049
Stress response syndrome
doesn'tjust go away.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.926
It takes treatment
and...
Okay.

39:18.314 --> 39:19.929
Okay?
Yeah.

39:20.692 --> 39:22.523
What about you?
Can you treat me?

39:23.611 --> 39:26.694
Why?
ldonter
most doctors.

39:26.781 --> 39:28.112
I like you.

39:29.784 --> 39:31.615
What's in it for me?

39:38.167 --> 39:39.452
Pumpkin beers.

39:41.129 --> 39:42.710
Pree saved us
a couple.

39:49.804 --> 39:51.510
Disobeying
orders,

39:52.181 --> 39:53.637
cutting off
your ear.

39:54.684 --> 39:56.174
What's going on
with you, Jaqobis?

39:57.854 --> 39:59.185
You first.

39:59.981 --> 40:01.596
Strange red box,

40:01.691 --> 40:02.771
mystery burns,

40:02.859 --> 40:05.271
asking D'av tojoin
our team without
asking me first.

40:05.361 --> 40:06.817
He's your brother.
I thought you'd be happy.

40:06.863 --> 40:09.149
Of course I'm happy.
So then what's
the problem?

40:11.826 --> 40:13.532
lt's complicated.

40:14.329 --> 40:15.739
Foronce,

40:16.831 --> 40:18.332
I had something
that l was amazing at.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.077
I had a partner that
I loved working with.

40:20.168 --> 40:21.749
And then,
he just comes in
and he starts

40:21.836 --> 40:23.201
D'avin-ing all over it.

40:24.923 --> 40:26.003
(LAUGHS)

40:26.382 --> 40:28.122
They started him
at a Level Four,

40:28.217 --> 40:30.208
I'm allowed to be
conflicted for a day.

40:30.345 --> 40:32.461
His Level Four
is nothing

40:32.555 --> 40:33.761
compared to
the six years

40:33.848 --> 40:35.133
we've had each
other's backs.

40:35.975 --> 40:39.183
lfyou're worried
about being replaced,

40:39.854 --> 40:41.185
don't be.

40:42.523 --> 40:43.854
You're...

40:45.318 --> 40:47.809
Irreplaceable to me.

40:50.031 --> 40:51.020
(SIGHS)

40:53.201 --> 40:54.236
(CHUCKLES)

40:55.161 --> 40:56.526
Thank you.

40:57.705 --> 40:59.570
I like when you
use your words.

40:59.707 --> 41:02.198
Look, if you
ever want him gone,
he's gone.

41:02.335 --> 41:04.121
You can't make your
brother-crap our crap.

41:04.253 --> 41:06.244
I know.
You have to
deal with that.

41:06.381 --> 41:08.087
lwill.
Soon.

41:08.216 --> 41:11.629
Because he'll probably
just leave again

41:11.719 --> 41:13.755
once he finds that
doctor he's tracking.

41:20.728 --> 41:21.763
(SIGHS)

41:23.564 --> 41:25.725
Now you going to tell me
what's going on with you?

41:28.236 --> 41:29.601
If I tell you it's over,

41:30.780 --> 41:33.237
can we let that be enough?

41:34.909 --> 41:36.069
Okay.

41:37.286 --> 41:38.571
But no more secrets.

41:38.705 --> 41:39.740
No more secrets.

41:41.124 --> 41:42.739
Tap my heart.

41:45.628 --> 41:46.743
Good.

41:50.466 --> 41:51.546
(EXHALES)

41:51.634 --> 41:54.421
Now, ifyou'll excuse me,

41:55.596 --> 41:58.087
l have to go see
a girl about an ear.
