WEBVTT

04:24.656 --> 04:26.408
They will do nicely.

04:57.020 --> 04:58.363
Sit down.

05:07.905 --> 05:08.656
Well?

05:09.115 --> 05:11.664
The drug worked as you
said it would.

05:12.201 --> 05:15.876
They are completely under our control.

05:16.205 --> 05:18.333
You mean my control?

05:19.875 --> 05:20.797
Of course.

05:24.462 --> 05:26.339
These three men
will form the nucleus

05:26.673 --> 05:29.472
of the most deadly group of assassins

05:29.801 --> 05:31.678
the world has ever known.

05:32.720 --> 05:35.223
Three of the deadliest
men in the world,

05:35.557 --> 05:38.231
programmed to kill on my command.

05:41.395 --> 05:42.567
Death machines.

05:44.064 --> 05:48.535
I've worked years for this
and these men must be perfect.

05:48.861 --> 05:49.908
They are.

05:50.237 --> 05:52.740
So you say, before
I put them into action,

05:53.073 --> 05:55.451
I think you should run
them through another set

05:55.784 --> 05:57.410
of experimental tests.

05:58.369 --> 06:01.964
That man and his people
will be a good test.

06:03.666 --> 06:07.921
He's part of an old and
obsolete organization.

06:08.254 --> 06:09.881
It will be done.

06:10.214 --> 06:12.262
And so it shall be.

06:25.061 --> 06:27.405
Yeah George, this is Mr. G.

06:28.899 --> 06:32.778
Listen I got two jobs for you,
same price.

06:33.110 --> 06:36.410
Number one, a Chinese gentleman
by the name of Ho Lung,

06:36.739 --> 06:39.413
runs a karate studio in your city.

06:39.742 --> 06:43.212
Number two, Nathan
Adams, right the bank VP.

06:45.372 --> 06:47.920
I want them both hit by next week.

06:48.249 --> 06:49.045
So put your best men on it

06:49.375 --> 06:52.345
and let me know when it's done, right.

08:49.113 --> 08:49.864
Hey!

08:51.282 --> 08:52.579
No! No!

09:09.090 --> 09:09.841
Yeah?

09:12.344 --> 09:14.187
Fell off a building?

09:14.512 --> 09:18.061
What do you mean fell off a building?

09:18.390 --> 09:20.358
Accident, accident my ass!

09:22.978 --> 09:24.480
Hey, it's business.

09:25.481 --> 09:26.824
What about Adams?

09:28.651 --> 09:31.120
Well get someone else to
take care of him then.

09:31.445 --> 09:32.992
And after that,
see if you can hit Ho Lung

09:33.322 --> 09:36.074
and this time without screwing up.

09:38.993 --> 09:41.416
Hey, get your ass back in bed!

11:21.298 --> 11:22.049
Yeah?

11:23.717 --> 11:24.468
Blown up?

11:25.469 --> 11:27.312
Blown up, what do you mean blown up?

11:27.637 --> 11:29.389
If this continues and the
boys back east get word of it,

11:29.723 --> 11:31.521
I'm outta business or worse...

11:31.849 --> 11:33.396
Hell I should've known
you couldn't handle this.

11:33.726 --> 11:34.898
Who's doing it?

11:36.103 --> 11:38.197
Well how am I supposed
to know God damn it?

11:38.522 --> 11:39.774
What do you mean you don't know?

11:40.107 --> 11:41.404
Look, whoever is hitting my boys

11:41.734 --> 11:44.613
has probably got my line
tapped, you know what I mean?

11:44.945 --> 11:48.574
Yeah, well I'm calling
from a phone booth now.

11:51.951 --> 11:53.419
Well you better find out
who is doing it

11:53.745 --> 11:54.962
and take care of it.

11:55.288 --> 11:56.460
Well how am I supposed
to take care of it?

11:56.790 --> 11:59.009
I don't know what's going on.

12:02.587 --> 12:05.010
Now look Mr. G., I've got
to have some more time

12:05.339 --> 12:06.636
and some help too.

12:08.133 --> 12:12.229
They're trying to take this
town and shove it up my ass.

12:15.599 --> 12:17.943
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

12:29.904 --> 12:32.657
George, George, what's going on?

12:33.908 --> 12:36.752
God damn it can you hear me George?

12:38.037 --> 12:39.504
Hello, hello?

12:39.830 --> 12:40.797
Are you there?

12:41.832 --> 12:44.085
George, hello, hello, hello?

12:55.553 --> 12:56.725
Yeah, yeah?

12:57.054 --> 12:58.727
Mr. Gioretti?

12:59.056 --> 13:00.023
Who is this?

13:00.349 --> 13:02.568
I'm the one who's been
killing your men.

13:02.893 --> 13:05.237
Who is this damn it?

13:05.563 --> 13:09.534
All contract killings in
this city are under my control.

13:11.110 --> 13:13.658
If you want someone killed,

13:13.987 --> 13:16.911
I'm afraid you'll
have to deal with me.

13:19.325 --> 13:23.250
Deal with you, look I don't
have to deal with anyone.

13:23.580 --> 13:26.379
If you want someone
killed in this city,

13:26.708 --> 13:30.803
you must deal with us in person
and we will discuss the fee.

15:32.283 --> 15:33.375
Mr. Gioretti?

15:33.702 --> 15:34.954
Yeah Mike what is it?

15:35.286 --> 15:36.959
Don't you want me to
go in there with you?

15:37.288 --> 15:38.915
What for, I can handle this alone.

15:39.249 --> 15:40.000
Go eat dinner at Tony's,

15:40.333 --> 15:42.051
I'll call you there when I need you.

15:42.377 --> 15:45.630
But you shouldn't go in
there without protection.

15:45.963 --> 15:48.341
I mean why take
chances with those people?

15:48.674 --> 15:51.553
Look, I only hired you
because of your father,

15:51.885 --> 15:53.887
so don't start telling me what to do.

15:54.221 --> 15:57.521
Don't say shit to me, just
drive the car and do what I say.

15:57.850 --> 15:58.646
Do you understand?

15:58.976 --> 15:59.602
Yes sir.

16:01.310 --> 16:02.607
And you better be there when I call

16:02.937 --> 16:05.486
and not out screwing around
like you did last time.

16:05.815 --> 16:06.486
Do you hear?

16:06.816 --> 16:07.442
Yes sir.

16:31.006 --> 16:32.929
Mr. Gioretti, come in.

16:36.052 --> 16:37.395
Please, wait here.

16:54.402 --> 16:57.497
So good of you to come Mr. Gioretti.

16:58.448 --> 17:00.121
Oh don't mention it.

17:00.450 --> 17:03.875
Are you ready to avail
yourself of my services?

17:04.204 --> 17:07.752
Let's just say I don't intend
losing anymore of my men.

17:08.082 --> 17:10.675
Please accept my
expression of sympathy

17:11.001 --> 17:13.220
for the death of your employees.

17:13.545 --> 17:15.387
They were good men,
highly professional.

17:15.714 --> 17:17.590
I think you will
find my organization

17:17.925 --> 17:19.926
also highly professional.

17:22.012 --> 17:24.012
Well before I tell you
who I want hit,

17:24.347 --> 17:27.066
before I spend any of my money,

17:27.391 --> 17:30.895
I'd like to see just how
professional you really are.

17:31.229 --> 17:35.200
I shall gladly give you a
demonstration, after dinner.

17:45.325 --> 17:47.248
Here you are Mike.

17:47.577 --> 17:51.252
I don't care what anybody
says, you don't get spaghetti

17:51.581 --> 17:53.709
this good nowhere back east.

17:55.127 --> 17:56.629
I told the boys to fix it up

17:56.962 --> 17:59.635
extra special for a good friend.

17:59.964 --> 18:00.760
You're the best Tony.

18:01.090 --> 18:03.434
Hey that's right, wait
til you taste the sauce.

18:03.759 --> 18:06.979
It's special too, it's my own recipe.

18:07.304 --> 18:08.931
Lots of people they
ask me for the recipe

18:09.265 --> 18:11.108
but I tell them nothing doing.

18:11.433 --> 18:13.401
Hey Mike, why should I tell them huh?

18:13.727 --> 18:15.774
So they can open up
their own restaurant?

18:16.104 --> 18:18.072
Or maybe they eat at home?

18:18.398 --> 18:21.117
No, you want to taste food like this,

18:21.442 --> 18:23.240
you gotta come see Tony.

18:24.487 --> 18:27.741
Now you need anything
Mike, you just call me.

18:28.074 --> 18:29.747
All right Tony thank
you, it looks great.

18:30.076 --> 18:32.703
Hey, tastes good too, go on try.

18:39.293 --> 18:40.795
There you see what I say.

18:41.128 --> 18:43.096
Okay I'll let you eat now.

19:10.947 --> 19:12.699
Hey Tony, come here.

19:14.618 --> 19:15.414
It's good, no?

19:15.744 --> 19:17.997
No what do you call this, a joke?

19:18.330 --> 19:20.503
It's no joke, you find
it in the spaghetti?

19:20.831 --> 19:24.802
I fire the one who did this
even it's my own brother.

20:50.874 --> 20:53.878
Is the meal
for your liking Mr. Gioretti?

20:54.211 --> 20:56.930
It's all right, but
let's get down to business.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.179
Without the demonstration
you asked for?

20:59.508 --> 21:01.055
Yeah, yeah, later.

21:02.218 --> 21:03.686
If we can come to a
business agreement,

21:04.012 --> 21:06.014
I want these two men hit.

21:12.812 --> 21:14.314
Oh yes, Mr. Lung.

21:16.232 --> 21:20.327
He uses his karate studio as
a front for narcotics traffic.

21:21.236 --> 21:23.159
You're well informed.

21:23.488 --> 21:25.115
The other man, Nathan Adams.

21:25.449 --> 21:27.668
He keeps forgetting he's
supposed to be working for me.

21:27.993 --> 21:31.543
Kill him and he's
replaced by another one

21:31.872 --> 21:33.465
of your men at the bank.

21:34.541 --> 21:35.837
I just want him out.

21:36.167 --> 21:38.886
Now, what about that demonstration?

22:23.087 --> 22:26.761
The wine was not to
your liking Mr. Gioretti?

22:27.090 --> 22:30.185
You took my driver,
I took your waiter.

22:31.386 --> 22:33.388
Just to make things even.

22:33.721 --> 22:37.692
Of course Mr. Gioretti,
we must keep things even.

22:39.894 --> 22:41.987
Now, shall we do business?

22:43.647 --> 22:44.569
All right.

22:50.445 --> 22:52.038
You serve tonight.

23:35.737 --> 23:38.616
See that this man receives
one of our red Buddhas.

23:38.949 --> 23:42.078
I believe you can find him
at his karate school tonight.

23:42.411 --> 23:45.415
Oh and uh please
don't leave any witnesses.

24:16.276 --> 24:19.200
Does this Buddha belong to anyone?

24:20.739 --> 24:23.412
It was left outside of my office.

24:27.536 --> 24:29.630
Perhaps I'll keep it then.

28:41.316 --> 28:42.784
Hey wait a minute, I
know him, what happened?

28:43.110 --> 28:44.783
Got his hand cut off, he's in shock.

28:45.112 --> 28:46.614
- Jesus
- Can he make it?

28:46.947 --> 28:48.995
Not if you don't quit
talking to him.

28:50.825 --> 28:52.077
You all right?

28:54.495 --> 28:55.792
Lieutenant these are
two of the callers.

28:56.122 --> 28:57.169
I'll talk to them later.

30:17.573 --> 30:18.665
Clay.

30:21.327 --> 30:22.749
Thank you Mike.

30:23.120 --> 30:24.087
God I hate coming back here.

30:24.413 --> 30:25.665
It beats being on the streets.

30:25.998 --> 30:28.217
You'll change your
mind in a couple weeks.

30:29.377 --> 30:31.219
Eh, well if it isn't
Lieutenant Forrester.

30:32.212 --> 30:34.010
Glad to see you could join us.

30:34.339 --> 30:35.682
Don't start on me, we've been out

30:36.007 --> 30:37.259
on this case since 3:00 AM
this morning.

30:37.592 --> 30:39.515
All right, tell me
where's this Frank Thomas.

30:39.845 --> 30:40.767
What room are they keeping him in?

30:41.096 --> 30:41.813
Why do you wanna know?

30:42.138 --> 30:42.809
It's our case.

30:43.139 --> 30:44.356
Well you guys have been ticketed

30:44.683 --> 30:45.980
for that human relations lapse.

30:46.309 --> 30:47.560
That's what the captain said.

30:47.893 --> 30:50.396
We'll handle that, you
stay out of our case.

30:50.729 --> 30:52.322
Okay it's your funeral.

30:52.648 --> 30:56.152
He's right, here's a
memo from the captain.

30:56.485 --> 30:58.237
Oh screw that human relations crap.

30:58.571 --> 31:00.039
You were supposed to show
up today for a makeup today

31:00.364 --> 31:01.331
and I'm supposed to go with you.

31:02.783 --> 31:04.830
Forrester, homicide.

31:05.159 --> 31:07.207
Fine, we'll be right out.

31:07.537 --> 31:08.413
Hospital?

31:08.746 --> 31:09.872
Frank is conscious,
we can talk to him.

31:10.206 --> 31:11.833
Hey, what about this?

31:12.166 --> 31:14.089
What do you wanna be, a
detective or a paper pusher?

31:14.419 --> 31:15.045
Let's go.

31:24.511 --> 31:26.104
Don't you think we better check out

31:26.430 --> 31:27.602
that human relations class?

31:27.931 --> 31:29.308
Don't worry about it Jerry.

31:29.641 --> 31:30.938
Lieutenant Forrester,
Frank Thomas' room.

31:31.268 --> 31:32.986
Room 376 down the hall.

31:33.312 --> 31:34.108
Thank you.

31:35.647 --> 31:37.115
I hate hospitals.

31:37.441 --> 31:38.157
You better get used to them,

31:38.482 --> 31:41.156
we spend a lot of time in
hospitals questioning people.

31:41.485 --> 31:42.828
I don't think
I'll ever get used to it.

31:43.154 --> 31:43.950
Hi Lieutenant.

31:44.280 --> 31:45.076
Were there any visitors?

31:45.406 --> 31:46.328
Nobody just the hospital staff.

31:46.657 --> 31:47.328
Keep your eyes open.

31:47.658 --> 31:48.284
Right.

31:54.915 --> 31:55.666
Frank?

31:57.542 --> 31:58.293
Frank?

31:59.419 --> 32:00.511
I'm awake.

32:00.837 --> 32:04.262
Clay Forrester, my
partner Jerry Farnham.

32:04.591 --> 32:07.686
What are you guys
doing here, questions?

32:08.011 --> 32:09.012
You up to it?

32:09.346 --> 32:10.814
Sure.

32:11.139 --> 32:14.062
Frank have you ever
seen this before?

32:14.391 --> 32:18.441
Mr. Lung, our instructor,
found it somewhere.

32:18.771 --> 32:20.694
I don't know where.

32:21.023 --> 32:23.446
I've only got one question,

32:23.776 --> 32:26.575
could you identify them
if you saw them again?

32:26.904 --> 32:29.372
I'll never forget their faces.

32:30.448 --> 32:33.827
If you don't find them
Forrester, I will.

32:34.160 --> 32:36.538
You leave the police work to me.

32:36.871 --> 32:39.249
Who's talking about police work?

32:39.582 --> 32:43.507
If I find them first, I'll
send them to you in pieces.

32:43.836 --> 32:45.462
You're not going anywhere
for a while.

32:45.796 --> 32:47.298
I'll stop in later
with a sketch artist

32:47.631 --> 32:49.850
to draw up those faces
before you forget them.

32:51.218 --> 32:53.892
Lieutenant,
I won't be forgetting them.

32:54.429 --> 32:56.648
Good, we'll be seeing you.

32:56.974 --> 32:59.272
Take care of yourself Frank.

33:03.729 --> 33:04.821
Fun job I bet.

33:05.147 --> 33:06.820
Nurses are the only
thing keeping me awake.

33:07.149 --> 33:07.866
Well at least you're inside.

33:08.192 --> 33:09.239
Yeah, see ya.

33:12.238 --> 33:15.037
Oh Lieutenant, about
those security rules,

33:15.366 --> 33:16.913
can the patient receive gifts?

33:17.243 --> 33:18.368
Like what?

33:18.702 --> 33:21.501
Well this package was
left for him downstairs.

33:21.830 --> 33:24.504
There was no card on it,
just his name on the box.

33:24.833 --> 33:27.211
Well let's have a look at it.

33:52.608 --> 33:56.613
Thought I was clear when I
told you to leave no witnesses.

33:56.946 --> 33:59.199
I just delivered a
Buddha to the hospital.

33:59.532 --> 34:02.206
The witness is on the 3rd floor.

34:02.535 --> 34:03.707
I suggest you finish the job tonight

34:04.037 --> 34:06.836
before he tells the police too much.

34:25.556 --> 34:27.433
I'm sorry I didn't mean to wake you.

34:27.766 --> 34:30.646
Oh if it isn't Florence
Nightingale again.

34:30.978 --> 34:33.606
You come to see if my
tubes are all in place?

34:33.938 --> 34:36.442
At least the insults are
getting a little tamer.

34:36.775 --> 34:39.905
You should've heard yourself
when you were under sedation.

34:40.196 --> 34:42.914
Say when are they gonna
take this junk off anyway?

34:43.239 --> 34:45.583
That's up to Dr.
Putnam, maybe in a week.

34:45.909 --> 34:48.788
Well, I'll tell you one thing,

34:49.120 --> 34:51.998
I'm not gonna let Putnam
put a God damn hook on me.

34:52.331 --> 34:54.208
Well that may not even be necessary.

34:54.542 --> 34:56.135
They have cosmetic hands now.

34:56.460 --> 34:58.963
Oh, that's a great choice isn't it.

34:59.296 --> 35:00.639
A useless decoration or something

35:00.964 --> 35:03.342
that turns me into a freak show.

35:03.675 --> 35:05.928
Look, I know how tough
it is being in a hospital

35:06.261 --> 35:08.059
and not having a family.

35:09.223 --> 35:13.069
Well, I've been on my
own for a long time now

35:14.144 --> 35:16.817
and everything is just okay.

35:17.146 --> 35:19.945
Everyone needs friends, we all do.

35:22.485 --> 35:26.285
The only thing I need
right now is my right hand.

35:26.614 --> 35:30.084
Say what are you, a
nurse or a psychiatrist?

35:31.494 --> 35:33.416
Just call me Florence.

38:23.321 --> 38:25.244
Mistress Lee, I'm afraid I have

38:25.573 --> 38:26.916
some upsetting news for you.

38:27.242 --> 38:28.118
What is it?

38:29.077 --> 38:30.454
It seems that one of
our men was either killed

38:30.787 --> 38:33.290
or captured at the hospital tonight.

38:33.623 --> 38:35.170
And the witness?

38:35.500 --> 38:37.422
They say he is dead.

38:37.751 --> 38:39.048
How was our man captured?

38:39.378 --> 38:41.301
They really don't
know, there were shots,

38:41.630 --> 38:43.098
they barely escaped.

38:44.258 --> 38:48.104
They thought he was behind
them when they fled.

38:50.848 --> 38:51.599
Fled!

39:28.883 --> 39:29.850
It's an old trick.

39:30.176 --> 39:31.894
Yeah but you're idea worked Clay.

39:32.219 --> 39:33.266
It's the next time
I'm worried about.

39:33.596 --> 39:35.269
Especially with those armored vests.

39:35.598 --> 39:37.851
Armored vests,
man these guys are heavy.

39:40.144 --> 39:41.942
Had to aim at his
head to bring him down.

39:42.271 --> 39:43.772
Joe you come upstairs
and you can stick by Frank's

39:44.105 --> 39:46.403
new room with the other officer
until we move Frank out.

39:46.733 --> 39:47.575
All right.

39:47.901 --> 39:49.778
Jerry check hospital security
to see how they got in.

39:50.111 --> 39:51.033
Right.

39:51.363 --> 39:52.159
I'll see you downstairs in

39:52.489 --> 39:53.240
okay-

40:45.205 --> 40:47.299
What are you doing here?

40:50.502 --> 40:54.256
You know you are forbidden
to enter this room.

41:23.783 --> 41:24.533
Oh excuse me.

41:24.867 --> 41:26.744
It's all right Lieutenant,
come on in.

41:27.077 --> 41:28.545
How's it going Frank?

41:28.871 --> 41:30.589
I guess I should be thanking you.

41:30.914 --> 41:31.881
What for?

41:32.207 --> 41:34.756
For saving my belly from
seven inches of steel.

41:35.085 --> 41:37.964
Okay, look, there's no
reason playing games with you.

41:38.297 --> 41:39.549
I think they're gonna try again,

41:39.882 --> 41:41.053
that's why I'm having you moved.

41:41.382 --> 41:43.009
Moved, where?

41:43.342 --> 41:45.436
To a small private
hospital in Santa Mira.

41:45.761 --> 41:46.887
You'll go in under an assumed name

41:47.221 --> 41:48.063
and we'll issue a
statement to the press

41:48.389 --> 41:50.062
that our only witness
can't be any help to us.

41:50.516 --> 41:51.984
Do you think that
will stop these guys

41:52.310 --> 41:53.436
from trying it again?

41:53.769 --> 41:54.736
Who's ever behind this
is gonna have enough

41:55.062 --> 41:57.531
to worry about once we
question our suspect.

41:57.856 --> 41:59.449
How are you doing otherwise?

41:59.774 --> 42:01.742
Oh fine, it's a great life.

42:02.068 --> 42:05.368
I just move my little finger
and they come running.

42:05.697 --> 42:09.952
Okay, get some sleep, you'll
be moving in a couple hours.

42:10.285 --> 42:12.708
Look I stopped by to
talk to Ned yesterday.

42:13.038 --> 42:14.039
He wants you to come
back to work for the bar

42:14.371 --> 42:15.918
once you get on your feet again.

42:16.248 --> 42:17.215
You interested?

42:17.541 --> 42:18.667
Sure, why not?

42:20.753 --> 42:24.007
A one handed bartender
should be a great draw.

42:25.758 --> 42:28.602
Every bar should have at least one.

42:43.608 --> 42:46.327
Well, if it isn't the dynamic duo,

42:46.653 --> 42:48.495
Lieutenant Forrester and Mr. Farnham.

42:48.820 --> 42:50.367
Doyle I'll give you one
second to get your ass

42:50.697 --> 42:52.074
out of my chair before I toss you

42:52.407 --> 42:54.535
and the chair right out the window.

42:54.868 --> 42:55.869
What's the matter Lieutenant,

42:56.203 --> 42:59.298
crying the paperwork blues again?

42:59.623 --> 43:01.967
Doyle get your ass outta
here we got work to do.

43:02.292 --> 43:03.464
Hey I'm just killing
time until my suspect comes

43:03.794 --> 43:05.921
down for questioning.

43:06.254 --> 43:08.256
You know the guy they
booked for attempted murder

43:08.589 --> 43:09.681
at the hospital?

43:10.007 --> 43:11.850
What are you talking about?

43:12.176 --> 43:14.474
Hey here comes our baby now.

43:24.479 --> 43:26.152
He's our baby.

43:26.481 --> 43:28.483
Oh no, not anymore.

43:28.817 --> 43:31.366
The captain's turned that
questioning over to me.

43:31.695 --> 43:33.072
Seems you two have been delinquent

43:33.405 --> 43:35.703
at the human relations course.

43:36.825 --> 43:38.497
God damn it.

43:38.826 --> 43:40.328
What's your bitch Forrester?

43:40.661 --> 43:42.504
Bringing that jackass on our case.

43:42.830 --> 43:45.299
Rating reports for the entire squad.

43:45.624 --> 43:47.342
Whole squad rates high,

43:48.294 --> 43:51.423
and now we come
to Lieutenant Forrester.

43:51.755 --> 43:52.722
Jesus Christ.

43:53.048 --> 43:54.800
Reports and paperwork,
late and incomplete.

43:55.133 --> 43:57.852
Press relations, smashed
a TV camera deliberately.

43:58.177 --> 43:58.894
No that was...

43:59.220 --> 44:01.598
Volunteer work, none,
favorable communications,

44:01.931 --> 44:05.561
two lousy letters, and
last, but not least,

44:05.893 --> 44:09.773
attendance and performance at
departmental training classes,

44:10.106 --> 44:12.949
you rank last in the entire squad.

44:13.275 --> 44:14.527
What about number of arrests?

44:14.860 --> 44:16.828
Number of convictions, sir?

44:17.154 --> 44:19.703
Listen Forrester, this damn
stuff is just as important

44:20.032 --> 44:21.409
as the street work.

44:21.742 --> 44:24.291
That's what the commissioner
looks at, like it or not.

44:24.620 --> 44:26.167
Sir we realize we
missed our makeup class

44:26.496 --> 44:28.589
but our key witness in the
karate school murders...

44:28.914 --> 44:32.885
Karate school murders,
karate, oh yeah, now I remember,

44:35.087 --> 44:37.681
I read about them in
the newspaper somewhere.

44:38.007 --> 44:39.805
Because I still
don't have your report!

44:40.176 --> 44:41.598
Hell, we were out til 3:00
in the morning...

44:41.927 --> 44:44.396
I don't give a damn
how late you were out.

44:44.722 --> 44:46.849
You should've taken the
time to at least jot down

44:47.182 --> 44:49.981
a lousy paragraph or two,
so when the chief comes

44:50.310 --> 44:53.154
and questions me about
it, I can halfway tell him

44:53.480 --> 44:57.451
something other than what
I read in the newspaper.

45:01.112 --> 45:04.365
Forrester, you get your butt
down to that human relations

45:04.698 --> 45:07.121
makeup session in half an hour.

45:07.451 --> 45:08.953
I put Doyle and Rossi on the case

45:09.286 --> 45:13.211
and you will fill them in, and
you will cooperate with them.

45:13.540 --> 45:15.258
Is that clear Lieutenant?

45:15.584 --> 45:16.927
Yes it's clear.

45:17.252 --> 45:19.003
Now, I want a full report
on your case,

45:19.337 --> 45:23.592
your former case, by
quitting time this afternoon.

45:23.925 --> 45:25.472
Is that clear Lieutenant?

45:25.760 --> 45:27.228
Yes, clear, right.

45:29.722 --> 45:33.477
Oh, and if you don't
like my style Forrester,

45:33.810 --> 45:37.029
you've got two choices,
turn in a transfer request,

45:37.354 --> 45:40.858
or turn in our badge,
I'll take either one.

45:41.191 --> 45:43.819
Otherwise get on with the program.

45:46.238 --> 45:50.334
Well Forrester, we'll let you
know how the case comes out.

45:51.827 --> 45:53.669
I hope you enjoy your class.

45:53.994 --> 45:55.667
Of course I've already taken my class.

45:55.996 --> 46:00.547
Can't you tell by the way
my personality has improved?

46:00.876 --> 46:02.549
You want a briefing on the case?

46:02.878 --> 46:04.346
No I think I have
all I need right now

46:04.672 --> 46:06.345
besides I don't think
your partner here

46:06.674 --> 46:09.643
is feeling any too cooperative today.

46:15.515 --> 46:17.438
All right we got it, go.

46:19.561 --> 46:20.813
What good is this, he'll never talk.

46:21.146 --> 46:22.944
He can listen, he can nod yes or no.

46:23.273 --> 46:25.275
The recorder won't pick up the nods.

46:25.607 --> 46:27.154
Well then Rossi one
of us is going to have

46:27.484 --> 46:31.034
to say "suspect gestures yes"
or suspect gestures no".

46:31.363 --> 46:32.364
Are you all set?

46:32.698 --> 46:33.415
Gonna uncuff him?

46:33.741 --> 46:34.742
DO what?

46:35.075 --> 46:35.826
Well that's
procedure, kinda rough...

46:36.160 --> 46:37.457
Are you crazy, you
saw what those victims

46:37.786 --> 46:39.754
he hauled outta the karate school.

46:40.080 --> 46:42.003
All right, want me
to start the recorder?

46:42.331 --> 46:44.299
Not yet, wait a minute.

46:44.625 --> 46:47.299
I want this off the record.

46:47.628 --> 46:49.255
Now I'm gonna put this
to you straight buddy,

46:49.672 --> 46:50.969
now we've got you nailed
for those murders

46:51.299 --> 46:52.721
at the karate school,

46:53.050 --> 46:55.303
and that attempted
murder at the hospital,

46:55.636 --> 46:58.139
so now if you cooperate with us

46:58.473 --> 47:02.102
things will go a hell
of a lot easier for you.

47:04.060 --> 47:05.528
All right, read him his rights.

47:05.854 --> 47:06.650
They did that already
when they booked him.

47:06.980 --> 47:08.698
I want it on tape Rossi.

47:09.024 --> 47:09.820
All right.

47:12.027 --> 47:13.995
You have the right to remain silent.

47:14.321 --> 47:15.947
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

47:16.280 --> 47:17.202
in a court of law.

47:17.531 --> 47:18.999
You have the right to talk to a lawyer

47:19.325 --> 47:20.793
and have him present while
you are being questioned.

47:21.118 --> 47:22.665
If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer,

47:22.995 --> 47:24.463
one will be appointed to represent you

47:24.789 --> 47:26.462
before any questioning if you wish.

47:26.791 --> 47:28.338
If you decide at any time
to exercise these rights

47:28.667 --> 47:30.590
and not answer any questions
or make any statements.

47:30.920 --> 47:31.967
You understand?

47:34.380 --> 47:35.757
There's something wrong with him.

47:36.090 --> 47:37.182
I think he's sick, I'm
going to uncuff him.

47:37.509 --> 47:40.638
Hey you want a glass of water?

50:10.194 --> 50:12.697
All units stolen
police vehicle 331

50:13.030 --> 50:15.783
suspect driving, dangerous,
may be armed,

50:16.116 --> 50:19.370
caucasian in black under shirt.

51:06.914 --> 51:08.791
Go ahead and eat son.

51:09.125 --> 51:11.593
Ma cooked it for you, no charge.

51:18.299 --> 51:20.973
You look like you've got trouble.

51:21.970 --> 51:25.349
Just remember, no matter what happens,

51:25.682 --> 51:29.231
put your trust in God and he'll
guide you to the right path.

51:29.560 --> 51:30.482
I know it's hard to believe,

51:30.811 --> 51:32.188
especially when things are tough,

51:32.521 --> 51:36.492
but God looks out for all of
us, whether you believe or not.

51:37.609 --> 51:41.659
Now, I've got some pamphlets
here that you can have.

51:43.449 --> 51:47.544
And I want you to read them,
they'll help you to find God.

51:48.703 --> 51:51.297
And if ever need anyone to talk to,

51:51.622 --> 51:54.626
you can always come and see Ma and me.

51:54.959 --> 51:57.633
And if we're not open,
we live in the back.

51:57.962 --> 52:01.932
And you can come look us
up at any time, any time.

52:17.688 --> 52:19.611
Let me have a beer.

52:19.940 --> 52:22.409
Yeah a lot of beers
and a cheeseburger.

52:22.735 --> 52:24.783
What a dump this place is man.

52:25.112 --> 52:26.159
I don't wanna eat here.

52:26.489 --> 52:29.368
Shut up asshole, we're eating here.

52:36.790 --> 52:39.634
Hey, where's my beer, what is this?

52:41.211 --> 52:43.634
Don't mess with my hair
man, don't do that.

52:44.255 --> 52:45.802
See that, huh?

52:49.803 --> 52:52.055
Weapon, that's my weapon.

52:52.721 --> 52:53.893
Oh, oh.

52:54.848 --> 52:56.896
Hey good looking what
are you doing today?

52:57.559 --> 52:59.653
Seems like you could
go for a little putt.

52:59.978 --> 53:01.776
Leave this dipshit your with
and we'll go for a little ride,

53:02.106 --> 53:03.153
how about that?

53:06.485 --> 53:09.328
That wind would mess up her hair.

53:09.654 --> 53:12.282
Oh it's okay, I'll
take care of her hair.

53:12.615 --> 53:13.832
Hey you just sit down and be social.

53:14.158 --> 53:15.876
Come on boys,
leave my customers alone.

53:16.202 --> 53:17.920
You just serve the beer old man.

53:18.246 --> 53:21.250
Oh John leave the
broad alone will ya.

53:22.250 --> 53:23.422
Beer here, hey,

53:24.835 --> 53:26.508
who's the Tarzan guy?

53:29.714 --> 53:30.636
Hey, Tarzan?

53:38.598 --> 53:41.225
Are you running from the law man?

53:43.102 --> 53:45.104
Hey this guy is running from the law.

53:45.437 --> 53:46.984
Hey Tony I smell pig man,

53:47.314 --> 53:49.737
I think that dude is
probably an undercover cop.

53:50.067 --> 53:54.038
Yeah, look at his haircut,
he's gotta be a pig man.

53:55.656 --> 53:57.454
I don't know man, undercover
cops man they got long hair

53:57.783 --> 54:00.877
and that dude's got short hair.

54:01.202 --> 54:04.456
Oh eat it turkey, that guy
is a pig, can't you smell it?

54:04.789 --> 54:05.415
Ugh,bad.

54:07.750 --> 54:09.627
Hey are you a cop?

54:09.961 --> 54:11.178
Are you a cop?

54:11.504 --> 54:13.177
Hey I'm talking to you.

54:19.136 --> 54:23.437
I'm talking to you, I'm
talking to you, Tarzan.

54:23.765 --> 54:27.144
I'm talking to you,
shit this guy is a cop.

54:31.522 --> 54:32.944
This guy is weird.

54:34.066 --> 54:37.070
Hey don't you hear me talking to you?

54:39.906 --> 54:43.160
Don't you hear me talking to you?

54:43.492 --> 54:45.119
Talking to you Tarzan.

54:46.495 --> 54:50.590
Hey Tarzan, he's sitting
there eating his cheeseburger.

54:52.834 --> 54:54.928
Tarzan, look at the
muscles on that guy man.

54:55.253 --> 54:57.221
He's got long hair and everything.

54:57.547 --> 55:01.222
Guy's gotta be running from
the law, look at that outfit.

55:01.551 --> 55:04.725
Hey, hey, you,
I'm talking to you, Tarzan.

55:07.389 --> 55:09.391
Listen, look at this guy.

55:10.517 --> 55:13.361
Look at this, man the
guy's got the muscles.

55:13.687 --> 55:16.190
I got muscles, mine are
all on the inside though.

55:18.317 --> 55:19.910
Hey, this guy's got blood on him.

55:20.236 --> 55:22.158
Hey what's the matter with you man?

55:22.487 --> 55:24.455
Hey what, hey what do we got here?

55:24.781 --> 55:26.124
Hey man you are running from the law.

55:33.998 --> 55:35.796
You know this old world

55:36.125 --> 55:37.752
has it's ups and downs.

55:38.086 --> 55:39.257
Stomp him baby.

55:39.544 --> 55:41.296
The
other side is brotherly love.

55:41.630 --> 55:42.802
So if you haven't sent for
the 3-D book color portrait

55:43.131 --> 55:44.303
of the Holy Trinity,
well now is the time

55:44.675 --> 55:46.598
because it's a picture so
real to life,

55:47.219 --> 55:49.517
you can almost reach out and touch it.

55:49.846 --> 55:51.098
Oh shit.

55:51.431 --> 55:52.353
So
if you send in $5.99 now,

55:52.683 --> 55:54.481
the 3-D full color portrait
of the Holy Trinity

55:54.810 --> 55:58.530
plus the world's smallest
Bible, both for only $5.99.

55:58.854 --> 56:02.154
Send check or money order
to 3-D Box 422,

56:02.483 --> 56:03.700
Libby, California.

57:19.138 --> 57:20.355
You son of a...

57:45.121 --> 57:48.375
Perhaps we can continue
with our work.

57:50.293 --> 57:54.388
Mr. Gioretti has suggested we
try to persuade Nathan Adams

57:57.383 --> 58:01.479
to relinquish his position
without resorting to violence.

58:04.181 --> 58:06.275
You wish me to have a talk with him?

58:06.600 --> 58:10.570
Yes, but before you do I
think we need some leverage.

58:12.897 --> 58:13.739
Leverage?

58:15.900 --> 58:17.493
He has a daughter.

58:29.538 --> 58:32.337
Well I'm fine daddy,
I'm only 40 miles away.

58:32.666 --> 58:36.512
It's not like I'm on the
other side of the world.

58:36.837 --> 58:37.463
Okay.

58:39.881 --> 58:43.350
Okay, hey look, if I
don't finish my homework

58:43.676 --> 58:45.724
I'll flunk out this semester.

58:46.053 --> 58:48.852
Can't you see the headlines,
bank president's daughter fails

58:49.181 --> 58:53.152
first semester of college,
shamed father jumps out window.

58:54.311 --> 58:57.861
No I don't have any
boys in the apartment.

58:58.190 --> 58:59.191
With all the time I'm on the phone

58:59.524 --> 59:02.778
I haven't had a chance to meet any.

59:03.111 --> 59:04.658
Okay, I love you too.

59:08.867 --> 59:09.618
Bye.

59:52.491 --> 59:53.208
Yes Kay?

59:53.533 --> 59:56.628
There's a Mr. Lu
to see you, all right.

59:59.247 --> 01:00:00.794
Mr. Adams will see you now.

01:00:01.124 --> 01:00:02.671
Thank you.

01:00:11.509 --> 01:00:13.853
Mr. Lu, please have a seat.

01:00:15.304 --> 01:00:16.772
Thank you.

01:00:17.097 --> 01:00:18.519
I'm sorry but I must apologize,

01:00:18.849 --> 01:00:19.850
my secretary didn't tell me

01:00:20.184 --> 01:00:21.777
the nature of your business here.

01:00:22.102 --> 01:00:23.353
I believe it was an ancestor of mine

01:00:23.686 --> 01:00:26.860
who once said a picture
speaks 1000 words.

01:00:30.318 --> 01:00:32.116
The others in the photograph
don't matter

01:00:32.445 --> 01:00:35.995
but you do recognize your daughter.

01:00:36.324 --> 01:00:37.997
We do not want money,
everything will work out

01:00:38.326 --> 01:00:41.499
and no harm will come to anyone.

01:00:41.828 --> 01:00:44.377
Harm to no one, putting
my daughter through this?

01:00:44.706 --> 01:00:47.630
She was not totally
conscious at the time.

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:51.555
Get out of here, this
cheap shakedown won't work.

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.006
You know of course that
your financial colleagues

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:55.058
will receive a set of these pictures?

01:00:55.384 --> 01:00:56.976
I can explain it to them.

01:00:57.301 --> 01:00:59.349
And will an explanation
be sufficient?

01:00:59.679 --> 01:01:02.432
In your daughter's case,
it might be a traumatic experience,

01:01:02.765 --> 01:01:06.861
a shame that might haunt her
for the rest of her life.

01:01:07.186 --> 01:01:08.938
Even though your daughter may
be as sexually sophisticated

01:01:09.272 --> 01:01:13.651
as other students today, I'm
quite sure their sexual habits

01:01:13.984 --> 01:01:15.452
do not include this.

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:21.078
Our clients wish you
to resign your position

01:01:22.993 --> 01:01:24.836
and recommend this man.

01:01:26.496 --> 01:01:27.964
What?

01:01:28.290 --> 01:01:30.042
Sever your connections
with this bank.

01:01:30.749 --> 01:01:32.672
You may then relocate
to a different city

01:01:33.002 --> 01:01:34.879
and resume your career.

01:01:35.212 --> 01:01:36.930
That will fulfill your obligation,

01:01:37.256 --> 01:01:39.475
you will not be asked
to do anything further.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:41.928
Gioretti's behind this, isn't he?

01:01:42.261 --> 01:01:44.104
That I'm sorry, I cannot say.

01:01:44.430 --> 01:01:47.023
Merely, deliver your letter
of resignation by noon today.

01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:49.017
I'd be a fool to
walk away from a job

01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:51.773
that's taken me my whole
life to work up to.

01:01:52.103 --> 01:01:54.447
Just so a stooge can
get into the bank, no.

01:01:54.772 --> 01:01:56.649
In that case Mr. Adams,

01:01:57.942 --> 01:02:01.196
please, move over
to the filing cabinet.

01:02:01.529 --> 01:02:05.624
Move, I was hoping I did not
have to resort to violence.

01:02:55.287 --> 01:02:56.709
Goodbye Mr. Adams.

01:03:15.723 --> 01:03:16.815
Kay help me!

01:03:19.227 --> 01:03:21.229
Get in here I'm chained
to the filing cabinet

01:03:21.562 --> 01:03:23.690
and there's a bomb in here!

01:03:24.107 --> 01:03:25.154
The door is locked.

01:03:25.650 --> 01:03:26.742
Get the key!

01:03:38.662 --> 01:03:39.413
Kay!

01:03:50.798 --> 01:03:52.300
The door is locked.

01:04:01.808 --> 01:04:05.233
Mr. Adams you have
the key in your desk.

01:04:10.984 --> 01:04:11.826
Get help!

01:04:13.278 --> 01:04:15.326
Kay, get some help please!

01:04:38.259 --> 01:04:41.479
Help me! Somebody!

01:07:00.059 --> 01:07:01.151
Hello Frank.

01:07:02.854 --> 01:07:05.027
How did you know I was here?

01:07:05.355 --> 01:07:07.699
Ned at the bar told me.

01:07:08.025 --> 01:07:09.572
It's my lunch hour.

01:07:11.153 --> 01:07:15.249
He said you used to use
your lunch hours to study.

01:07:17.075 --> 01:07:19.373
Well I quit school.

01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:23.798
Why, I thought you had dreams
of becoming an architect?

01:07:24.123 --> 01:07:24.749
Yeah.

01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:30.638
Did you get the cards I sent down

01:07:30.963 --> 01:07:32.965
to the Santa Mira hospital?

01:07:33.299 --> 01:07:34.926
I tried to come down to
see how you were doing

01:07:35.217 --> 01:07:38.471
but my schedule has been
pretty rough lately.

01:07:38.803 --> 01:07:39.850
Nights, mostly.

01:07:41.556 --> 01:07:43.650
I have a few days off now.

01:07:45.101 --> 01:07:48.605
Thanks for coming
over, I'll see you out.

01:07:50.565 --> 01:07:54.695
Don't worry, I found
my way in by myself.

01:07:55.028 --> 01:07:56.324
Look, I'm sorry.

01:07:57.613 --> 01:08:00.958
I'm the one who's sorry
for getting involved.

01:08:01.283 --> 01:08:03.911
You don't know how it is for me.

01:08:04.244 --> 01:08:06.292
I know how it is Frank.

01:08:06.622 --> 01:08:07.999
No one asked you to go and...

01:08:08.332 --> 01:08:09.379
Get involved?

01:08:10.626 --> 01:08:11.969
Sure, no one did.

01:08:14.545 --> 01:08:17.719
Look, I won't be bothering
you anymore.

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:19.892
Goodbye Frank.

01:08:27.350 --> 01:08:29.522
Aren't you even going to call me back?

01:08:29.850 --> 01:08:31.649
Wasn't thinking about it.

01:08:31.979 --> 01:08:33.447
I can see it's going to
take some time

01:08:33.772 --> 01:08:35.365
getting used to you.

01:08:39.069 --> 01:08:41.743
Why would you even want to try?

01:08:43.948 --> 01:08:47.202
I don't know, maybe by
the time I get used to you,

01:08:47.535 --> 01:08:49.582
you'll be used to yourself.

01:08:50.578 --> 01:08:53.627
Would you like to come over
to the bar for some coffee?

01:08:53.957 --> 01:08:55.005
Maybe the waiter isn't too friendly

01:08:55.334 --> 01:08:56.961
but the coffee's pretty good.

01:08:57.294 --> 01:08:58.841
Is it a nice bar?

01:09:21.774 --> 01:09:23.027
I need a beer.

01:09:28.073 --> 01:09:29.620
That will be a dollar.

01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:31.577
A buck for one beer?

01:09:33.662 --> 01:09:36.005
Entertainment goes with it.

01:09:42.045 --> 01:09:45.049
Entertainment, you
call that entertainment?

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:48.009
Shit, I've seen better
entertainment in the zoo.

01:09:48.341 --> 01:09:52.063
Hey living in a monkey
house, I bet you have.

01:09:55.348 --> 01:09:57.601
Sorry to leave you alone, I
had to get those cases moved.

01:09:57.934 --> 01:10:02.690
That's all right, I was just
watching the entertainment.

01:10:03.023 --> 01:10:05.902
Oh, yeah,
Ned just hired her last week.

01:10:06.234 --> 01:10:10.283
He thought it would help
business, only it hasn't.

01:10:10.613 --> 01:10:13.207
Do you like working here?

01:10:13.532 --> 01:10:14.579
The hours are flexible enough

01:10:14.909 --> 01:10:17.662
which helped when I was in college.

01:10:17.995 --> 01:10:19.087
The pay is fair.

01:10:20.331 --> 01:10:23.084
What are your plans now
that you've quit school?

01:10:23.417 --> 01:10:27.171
I don't know, I just don't
know yet, I need time to think.

01:10:29.047 --> 01:10:30.890
Frank you got any
change for the jukebox?

01:10:31.216 --> 01:10:32.968
Not now Sharon.

01:10:33.301 --> 01:10:35.224
All right Frank.

01:10:35.553 --> 01:10:38.227
Does she always ask you for change?

01:10:38.556 --> 01:10:40.979
Oh that's just her way
of getting tips.

01:10:41.309 --> 01:10:42.981
Frank will get me another case

01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:44.903
of beer from the back?

01:10:45.229 --> 01:10:46.355
Yeah sure Ned.

01:10:50.901 --> 01:10:53.950
So that was you who called
on the phone.

01:10:54.279 --> 01:10:56.828
Well I see you found him all right.

01:10:57.157 --> 01:10:59.330
Oh yeah, he was down
at the karate school

01:10:59.659 --> 01:11:01.332
just like you said.

01:11:01.661 --> 01:11:03.459
I don't know what's gotten into him.

01:11:03.788 --> 01:11:05.961
He's been there everyday this week.

01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:09.669
He's just trying to find himself.

01:11:10.002 --> 01:11:12.096
It was a terrible thing
that happened to him

01:11:12.421 --> 01:11:14.515
but he shouldn't be wasting his time

01:11:14.841 --> 01:11:17.719
in a closed down karate school.

01:11:18.051 --> 01:11:19.519
He'll be all right.

01:11:19.845 --> 01:11:23.770
And don't you give up on him,
no matter how nasty he gets.

01:11:25.433 --> 01:11:28.186
If you can't bring him around,
nobody can.

01:11:28.520 --> 01:11:30.864
Maybe your dancer can.

01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:33.486
Oh I wouldn't worry about her.

01:11:33.774 --> 01:11:36.197
Hey give me a beer.

01:11:36.527 --> 01:11:38.245
All right, all right.

01:12:00.508 --> 01:12:02.556
Hey this jukebox doesn't work.

01:12:02.886 --> 01:12:06.060
All right, all right,
just hit it easy.

01:12:16.148 --> 01:12:16.899
Hey!

01:12:20.694 --> 01:12:21.786
Come on now.

01:12:23.779 --> 01:12:25.952
Knock it off, knock it off.

01:12:26.282 --> 01:12:26.783
It still doesn't work.

01:12:27.116 --> 01:12:29.210
All right, all right, I'll
give you your money back.

01:12:29.535 --> 01:12:30.411
Let it alone.

01:12:33.456 --> 01:12:36.835
I want the buck for the
beer back too, it stinks.

01:12:37.168 --> 01:12:37.669
Why don't you shut the hell up?

01:12:39.503 --> 01:12:40.879
Hey knock it off.

01:14:37.697 --> 01:14:38.448
Frank.

01:14:40.533 --> 01:14:41.284
What?

01:14:43.786 --> 01:14:44.628
What now?

01:14:46.539 --> 01:14:47.711
I don't know.

01:14:51.044 --> 01:14:53.797
Where do we go from here?

01:14:54.129 --> 01:14:56.052
Well I guess I go back to
the bar and you go back...

01:14:56.381 --> 01:14:58.099
Back to the hospital.

01:14:59.009 --> 01:15:02.104
I'm sorry I didn't mean it that way.

01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:04.648
Maybe we should both
go back to the hospital

01:15:04.973 --> 01:15:06.850
and start all over again.

01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:11.484
I wish we could go back in time.

01:15:11.812 --> 01:15:14.736
I'd like to go back a
lot farther than that.

01:15:15.066 --> 01:15:17.194
To when those three guys came
crashing through that window.

01:15:17.526 --> 01:15:19.654
If only I had gotten one of them.

01:15:19.987 --> 01:15:21.705
Trade a life for a hand?

01:15:22.031 --> 01:15:25.331
Yes, I'd feel a lot
better about this now.

01:15:25.659 --> 01:15:28.377
Look, you should get
away from here for a while.

01:15:28.703 --> 01:15:30.626
Get away from this apartment,
away from the karate studio,

01:15:30.955 --> 01:15:33.458
away from the bar, from everything.

01:15:33.792 --> 01:15:35.590
Just for a little while.

01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:45.018
You said you had a few
days off from the hospital.

01:15:45.344 --> 01:15:46.220
Three days.

01:15:48.097 --> 01:15:48.893
Well maybe we could drive out

01:15:49.223 --> 01:15:51.225
to the ocean for a couple days.

01:15:51.558 --> 01:15:55.108
I've got enough money for
food, gas, a movie or two,

01:15:55.437 --> 01:15:56.233
and a motel.

01:15:57.689 --> 01:16:00.033
Is it a nice motel?

01:16:59.414 --> 01:17:01.587
Our employer Mr. Gioretti
is arriving

01:17:01.916 --> 01:17:04.169
at his airfield in one hour.

01:17:06.254 --> 01:17:08.676
He is bringing the balance
of the money.

01:17:09.006 --> 01:17:11.509
Shall we give him the usual receipt?

01:17:11.842 --> 01:17:14.220
Of course, he's not
powerful enough to change

01:17:14.553 --> 01:17:16.772
our method of doing business.

01:17:18.182 --> 01:17:20.560
I'll take care of him myself.

01:17:20.893 --> 01:17:22.816
You had better take help.

01:17:23.145 --> 01:17:26.694
Mr. Gioretti may have
the same idea about us.

01:17:43.163 --> 01:17:44.665
It shall be done.

01:18:41.426 --> 01:18:42.143
It's them!

01:18:42.469 --> 01:18:42.970
What?

01:18:43.303 --> 01:18:43.804
It's them!

01:18:44.137 --> 01:18:44.638
' Who?

01:18:44.972 --> 01:18:46.690
The guys who cut off my hand.

01:18:47.015 --> 01:18:48.232
Get the license plate number.

01:18:48.559 --> 01:18:49.935
605 CWJ, 605 CWJ.

01:18:58.192 --> 01:19:00.194
Get out and call the
police department!

01:19:01.195 --> 01:19:03.243
Homicide,
ask for Lieutenant Forrester.

01:19:03.573 --> 01:19:04.540
Tell him what's happening.

01:19:04.865 --> 01:19:05.365
What are you going to do?

01:19:05.699 --> 01:19:06.825
Just get out before I lose them.

01:19:07.158 --> 01:19:07.750
You can't go after them.

01:19:08.076 --> 01:19:09.544
I'm just gonna follow them, get out.

01:19:09.869 --> 01:19:10.370
But Frank.

01:19:10.704 --> 01:19:11.330
Get out!

01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:28.137
Forrester, homicide.

01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:29.972
Oh yes what can I do for you?

01:19:30.306 --> 01:19:31.307
We just found the three
men who killed the people

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:33.108
in the karate studio.

01:19:33.434 --> 01:19:34.606
You found them?

01:19:34.935 --> 01:19:36.812
No, just calm down.

01:19:37.146 --> 01:19:39.819
Did you get the license number?

01:19:40.148 --> 01:19:41.900
Where are you now?

01:19:42.233 --> 01:19:44.201
Stay there I'll put a tracer
on the license number.

01:19:44.527 --> 01:19:45.278
Frank's following them now,

01:19:45.612 --> 01:19:46.738
I don't know what he's going to do.

01:19:47.071 --> 01:19:48.368
Just stay there.

01:19:50.825 --> 01:19:52.372
Put a tracer out on
this, meet me in a car,

01:19:52.702 --> 01:19:55.625
and tell them to radio
the information.

01:19:57.664 --> 01:20:00.383
Forrester, where the hell
are you going?

01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:02.427
I want that report.

01:20:02.753 --> 01:20:04.596
Look, the three suspects
in the karate school murders

01:20:04.921 --> 01:20:05.797
have just been sighted.

01:20:06.131 --> 01:20:07.223
I have a chance to pick
up all three of them,

01:20:07.549 --> 01:20:09.051
including the one that
Doyle let escape

01:20:09.384 --> 01:20:10.806
and tear up the department.

01:20:11.136 --> 01:20:13.103
So to hell with the report,
to hell with the paperwork,

01:20:13.429 --> 01:20:14.396
and screw you.

01:20:17.642 --> 01:20:18.564
Forrester.

01:20:19.852 --> 01:20:20.603
Forrester.

01:26:58.476 --> 01:27:01.571
Mr. Gioretti has been taken care of.

01:27:18.829 --> 01:27:22.834
I think it is time to
take care of those three.

01:27:28.713 --> 01:27:29.839
Gladly.

01:30:27.131 --> 01:30:28.383
You all right?

01:30:30.259 --> 01:30:31.010
Frank?

01:30:32.761 --> 01:30:33.683
It's okay.

01:31:39.198 --> 01:31:39.949
Hello.

01:31:43.369 --> 01:31:47.169
Flight 983 leaves at gate 4
in half an hour.

01:31:47.498 --> 01:31:48.875
Enjoy your flight.
