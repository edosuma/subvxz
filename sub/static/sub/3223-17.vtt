00:02.760 --> 00:05.445
- She's... She's a demon, Sam.
- Meg.

00:05.600 --> 00:08.251
Remember me?
I sure remember you, Clarence.

00:08.440 --> 00:10.283
I learned that from the pizza man.

00:10.840 --> 00:12.968
She's running.
You're running from Crowley.

00:13.120 --> 00:15.088
My name is Naomi. We rescued you.

00:15.280 --> 00:16.850
They're controlling us, Castiel.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.968
Kill him. This is a direct order.

00:19.160 --> 00:20.321
What did I just do?

00:20.480 --> 00:23.324
- Tell the Winchesters Samandriel was...
- Compromised.

00:23.480 --> 00:24.766
- You acted in...
- Self-defense.

00:24.960 --> 00:26.610
Cass, you okay?

00:28.640 --> 00:31.120
There's another tablet?
So another word of God.

00:31.880 --> 00:34.929
The Angel Tablet, Castiel.
Crowley knows.

00:35.080 --> 00:38.402
God built a series of tests.
You do all three, slam the gates of hell.

00:38.600 --> 00:39.840
Sam, I didn't pass a test.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.048
But I did, and I'm doing
the rest of them.

00:43.640 --> 00:47.850
Cass, you got your ears on? You keep
a lookout for my little brother, okay?

01:13.920 --> 01:15.570
No.

01:17.480 --> 01:19.130
No, Cass, no.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.009
No, Cass, don't, please.

01:51.720 --> 01:56.009
No hesitation, quick, brutal.

01:56.160 --> 01:57.525
Everything's back in order.

01:58.840 --> 02:00.080
Finally...

02:01.000 --> 02:02.843
...you're ready.

02:26.800 --> 02:30.043
What the hell is this?

02:31.600 --> 02:33.125
"Spear of Destiny"?

02:33.280 --> 02:34.964
What, is this God's toothpick?

02:38.760 --> 02:41.570
Would it have killed these ass-hats
to label these boxes...

02:41.760 --> 02:43.762
...in something
other than hieroglyphics?

02:43.920 --> 02:44.967
It's ridiculous.

02:51.640 --> 02:53.085
Hey, you listening to me?

02:55.200 --> 02:57.885
Yeah, it's, ahem, fascinating stuff.

02:58.040 --> 03:02.364
You should probably write it all down in
your journal for the archives, you know?

03:03.240 --> 03:04.890
Yeah, thanks. You're a lot of help.

03:12.520 --> 03:15.091
Hey, Doc Holliday,
you all right over there?

03:18.400 --> 03:23.327
Uh, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Just wrong pipe.

03:33.720 --> 03:34.801
Well, hello.

03:35.600 --> 03:39.810
These Men of Letters
weren't so boring after all.

03:44.960 --> 03:48.203
- Hey, check this out.
- What is wrong with you?

03:48.360 --> 03:50.362
You kidding me?
This is a first edition.

03:50.520 --> 03:54.206
- Know what this would go for on eBay?
- No. Why? Do you?

03:55.160 --> 03:57.606
No. Maybe.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.643
Shut up. You find anything?

04:00.840 --> 04:05.004
I did, yeah. Uh, dead bodies showing up
all over the Midwest last week.

04:05.160 --> 04:08.846
Benton, Indiana, Downers Grove,
Illinois, Novi, Michigan...

04:09.000 --> 04:11.810
...and then again last night
in Lincoln Springs, Missouri.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.166
And how is this us?

04:13.320 --> 04:16.721
Each victim had severe burns
around their eyes, hands and feet...

04:16.880 --> 04:18.928
...puncture wounds through
their hands...

04:19.079 --> 04:21.890
...eyes and internal organs liquefied.

04:23.120 --> 04:24.804
- That sounds like us.
- Yeah.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.122
Also no link
between any of the victims.

04:27.280 --> 04:30.124
One was a real-estate agent.
Another was a local historian.

04:30.280 --> 04:33.045
- Woman killed last night was a teacher.
- So chupacabra.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.168
What do we got,
power tools gone rogue?

04:35.320 --> 04:38.767
Wait, are we talking
a Maximum Overdrive situation here?

04:39.960 --> 04:41.928
I don't know. Worth a shot, though.

04:42.080 --> 04:44.606
I'll grab my gear.
We should probably leave in five.

04:45.480 --> 04:48.404
Unless, of course, you need some
more time with Miss October.

04:48.560 --> 04:50.210
What?

04:50.880 --> 04:52.041
Oh.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.770
Yeah. Yeah, make it ten.

05:11.480 --> 05:15.087
We just have a few routine follow-up
questions about your wife, sir.

05:16.040 --> 05:17.530
Did she have any enemies?

05:17.680 --> 05:22.083
Ann? Honestly, I can't think
of a soul who'd want to hurt her.

05:22.240 --> 05:25.449
- Even after everything that happened.
- Everything that happened?

05:25.600 --> 05:29.207
About a week ago
something changed in Ann.

05:29.360 --> 05:32.887
She was out of sorts, not herself at all.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.166
Out of sorts how?

05:35.600 --> 05:37.045
It'll be better if I show you.

05:38.200 --> 05:42.125
She stopped sleeping.
She stopped eating.

05:42.320 --> 05:45.847
She went out in the middle of the night
going God knows where.

05:46.000 --> 05:50.801
I tried to talk to her,
but she would just mutter to herself.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.803
About what?

05:52.960 --> 05:56.931
Something about an orchard.

05:57.400 --> 06:02.645
Finally I just followed her one night,
and she went to the playground.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.366
Over here, the elementary school.

06:06.160 --> 06:07.969
And she started digging.

06:08.120 --> 06:10.407
She'd leave with
these little bags full of dirt.

06:10.560 --> 06:12.403
Hung them here.

06:12.600 --> 06:17.162
All these bags represent holes
that she dug in the ground.

06:17.320 --> 06:20.767
Were these holes,
I don't know, 6 feet deep?

06:20.920 --> 06:24.606
No. She dug for hours.
She never broke a sweat.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.888
Straight down 10, maybe 15 feet.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.325
Did you notice anything else?

06:35.400 --> 06:37.164
I didn't say anything to the cops...

06:37.320 --> 06:39.800
...because I didn't want them
to think I was crazy.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.525
After Ann came home...

06:41.680 --> 06:44.763
...I came down here to confront her
and she was on the phone.

06:44.960 --> 06:47.247
- Any idea who she was talking to?
- No.

06:47.400 --> 06:48.686
But I know what I saw.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.450
And it wasn't my Annie.

06:51.520 --> 06:57.289
After I called her out,
her eyes, they turned black.

07:00.600 --> 07:04.400
Now, I know I must have imagined it.
I know I did.

07:04.560 --> 07:07.643
But I left, I went to the bar,
probably had too much to drink...

07:07.800 --> 07:09.768
...and by the time I came back...

07:12.920 --> 07:15.207
...my Annie was...

07:18.480 --> 07:20.244
I should have stayed.

07:20.840 --> 07:23.161
I should have protected her.

07:24.200 --> 07:27.124
I'm moving into
my sister's place today.

07:28.120 --> 07:30.202
I can't be here anymore.

07:30.760 --> 07:32.171
Sure.

07:32.320 --> 07:36.245
Well, thank you very much
for your time.

07:36.400 --> 07:38.880
We're both very sorry for your loss.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.242
So somebody's killing demons.
That is awesome.

07:42.440 --> 07:44.920
- We should send a card or flowers.
- What flower says:

07:45.080 --> 07:46.445
"Thanks for killing demons"?

07:46.600 --> 07:48.841
Yeah, but who's killing demons
and why?

07:49.000 --> 07:51.606
By the way, since when
does a demon possess someone...

07:51.760 --> 07:54.889
...then go all Beautiful Mind
and start digging in the dirt?

07:55.040 --> 07:56.405
Does any of this seem right?

07:56.560 --> 07:59.689
I like the part about killing demons.
That sounds right.

08:05.120 --> 08:10.126
Sure, of course. Well, thank you
very much for all your help.

08:10.280 --> 08:14.046
I really appreciate the time.
All right. Bye.

08:14.200 --> 08:17.249
So real-estate guy's wife
said he was acting weird.

08:17.400 --> 08:22.406
Historian's hubby said the same.
Just got all obsessive and then weird.

08:22.600 --> 08:26.491
No one saw any black eyes, but still,
where there's smoke, you know.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.404
Wonder what they're all looking for.

08:28.560 --> 08:31.211
Wendy Rice here was the last person
to speak with Ann...

08:31.400 --> 08:33.482
...so let's see if she can tell us.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.207
Agent Lynne.
This is my partner, Agent Tandy.

08:41.360 --> 08:44.682
We'd like to ask you a few
questions about Ann Morton.

08:44.840 --> 08:47.446
Oh. Of course. Please, come in.

08:51.880 --> 08:54.850
I had never met her
before she called the other night.

08:55.560 --> 08:57.767
Now, why was she calling you?

08:58.440 --> 09:01.569
She was looking to find
an original map of the city.

09:02.640 --> 09:04.210
Did she say what for?

09:04.360 --> 09:09.651
Well, she didn't, but she did mention
an old orchard that had gone missing.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.040
Missing?

09:11.200 --> 09:15.888
This town was wiped from the earth
by one of the river's 100-year floods.

09:16.040 --> 09:21.843
Well, it was rebuilt,
but all the original records were lost.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.367
I'm a PhD candidate.

09:24.520 --> 09:29.003
And this is my research. I...

09:30.680 --> 09:33.923
My dissertation is
on the history of this town...

09:34.080 --> 09:38.847
...and its connection to
the Underground Railroad and whatnot.

09:39.000 --> 09:44.086
I've been working to re-create a map
for years as par': of my research.

09:44.240 --> 09:47.323
And this, this is the old
Jakubiak Orchard there.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.967
I found out yesterday
it's where Downey meets Bond Street.

09:51.120 --> 09:54.920
Now, did Ann say why she was looking
for the site of an old orchard?

09:55.080 --> 09:56.684
No.

09:56.840 --> 10:00.606
We set a time to meet
and she never showed.

10:01.840 --> 10:04.286
Then I read about her in the paper.

10:04.960 --> 10:07.167
It's just tragic.

10:07.840 --> 10:12.562
Ann's assistant called this morning,
though, asking if I still had the map.

10:12.720 --> 10:13.846
Assistant?

10:15.920 --> 10:19.129
That's probably him.
Maybe he can help.

10:26.040 --> 10:28.486
Oh. Are you...?

11:20.600 --> 11:21.931
Put this on your shoulder.

11:23.680 --> 11:24.966
I'm fine.

11:25.160 --> 11:28.801
The other demon escaped.
I bound the one I caught in a devil's trap.

11:28.960 --> 11:31.247
- I'll interrogate it now.
- Wait a second. Cass.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.687
How about you answer
some questions first?

11:33.840 --> 11:35.569
Like, where the hell have you been?

11:38.840 --> 11:41.161
You heard me, didn't you?

11:41.920 --> 11:42.967
You prayed to him?

11:44.720 --> 11:46.210
Yes, I heard you.

11:46.360 --> 11:49.170
But that's not why I'm here.

11:50.320 --> 11:51.606
I've been hunting demons.

11:54.600 --> 11:55.726
So this is you.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.648
- Why?
- What should I tell them?

12:01.160 --> 12:02.810
The truth.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.485
Most of it, anyway.

12:05.760 --> 12:08.604
Maybe they can get us closer.

12:09.280 --> 12:10.930
I'm searching for the other half...

12:11.120 --> 12:13.407
- ...of the Demon Tablet.
- Without us?

12:14.120 --> 12:15.770
I've been trying to help, Dean.

12:16.960 --> 12:20.089
And in my search, I uncovered that
Crowley has sent out demons...

12:20.240 --> 12:23.005
- ...to find Lucifer's Crypts.
- Lucifer had crypts?

12:23.160 --> 12:24.969
Dozens of them, apparently.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.851
But why the storage wars?
What are they all looking for?

12:28.000 --> 12:30.480
It would be more helpful
if they knew everything.

12:30.680 --> 12:32.125
- They cannot be trusted.
- But...

12:32.280 --> 12:34.044
Lie, Castiel.

12:35.680 --> 12:37.330
Tell them what we discussed.

12:37.520 --> 12:40.364
They're looking for a parchment
that would allow them...

12:40.520 --> 12:43.967
...to decipher Crowley's half
of the Demon Tablet without a prophet.

12:44.120 --> 12:48.330
A demonic decoder ring
in Crowley's hands? Awesome.

12:49.520 --> 12:52.251
The crypts were lost over time.

12:52.400 --> 12:55.563
Only those closest to Lucifer
knew their whereabouts.

12:55.720 --> 12:57.449
Then how did Crowley find them?

12:57.600 --> 13:01.286
His demons have been possessing locals
who may have some special knowledge.

13:02.240 --> 13:05.722
That would explain the crazy room
at Ann's house.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.881
- How did they know where to look?
- I don't know.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.566
I'm hoping the strange-haired demon
in the kitchen...

13:11.720 --> 13:14.405
...is more knowledgeable
than the others I interrogated.

13:17.520 --> 13:21.525
- Well, he puts the "ass" in "Cass," huh?
- He's definitely off.

13:21.680 --> 13:25.287
Off? He hasn't been right
since he got back from purgatory.

13:25.440 --> 13:28.410
We still don't know
how he got out of there.

13:28.800 --> 13:32.441
I don't know, Dean. If he's so sketchy,
then why were you praying to him?

13:35.840 --> 13:39.526
You know, I can hear you both.
I am a celestial being.

13:46.040 --> 13:49.647
Sam and Dean Winchester. Heh.

13:50.240 --> 13:53.722
Oh, the thoughts she had
about you two.

13:54.080 --> 13:55.366
Mostly you, Sam.

13:56.080 --> 13:57.161
What can I say?

13:57.800 --> 14:00.610
She has a thing for smutton chops.

14:00.760 --> 14:02.524
All right, you douchebag, listen...

14:12.360 --> 14:14.249
Who told you about the crypts?

14:16.440 --> 14:19.728
I thought angels were supposed
to be the good cops.

14:21.240 --> 14:22.651
Wait, stop.

14:23.920 --> 14:25.160
Stop.

14:25.320 --> 14:26.606
We have a hostage.

14:31.280 --> 14:32.770
It's one of Crowley's pets.

14:33.680 --> 14:37.127
She's at the Murray Hotel down by
the interstate. She knows the towns...

14:37.280 --> 14:40.443
...where all the crypts are buried.
She saw them back in the day.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.647
And she told you
about the parchment?

14:45.760 --> 14:47.125
What parchment?

14:47.320 --> 14:49.288
Hey, hey.

14:49.440 --> 14:51.727
Think he's the only bad cop
in this room?

14:51.880 --> 14:54.531
Stop lying.
We know what you're really looking for.

14:54.680 --> 14:58.162
- No, I am telling you, we're looking...
- Kill it.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.322
- ...for...
- Cass.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.284
- What?
- It told us what we needed.

15:05.440 --> 15:07.920
- No, she didn't...
- I started this hunt without you.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.923
I didn't want anything
to slow me down.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.890
- We have to get to the motel now.
- Hold on a second...

15:13.040 --> 15:15.122
- Cass.
- Cass? Cass? Damn it. Go, go, go.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.723
There, there.

15:38.160 --> 15:39.446
Thanks for waiting.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.401
The hostage is in there.

15:54.360 --> 15:57.170
Aren't you a little short
for a Stormtrooper?

16:00.680 --> 16:02.523
So I gotta ask.

16:04.440 --> 16:06.363
What's up with the hair?

16:06.520 --> 16:07.965
What?

16:08.120 --> 16:09.565
Thanks for noticing, Dean.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.722
But this wasn't my idea.
It was Crowley's.

16:11.880 --> 16:14.804
And it's just another reason
I want to stab him in the face.

16:15.080 --> 16:16.161
Wait a second.

16:16.320 --> 16:19.403
You've been telling Crowley
the location of Lucifer's Crypts.

16:19.560 --> 16:22.723
What can I say? I needed a break
from the constant torture.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.968
And I did visit them all
during my time with Yellow Eyes.

16:27.120 --> 16:30.727
But don't worry. I haven't exactly
been giving them the Glengarry leads.

16:32.360 --> 16:35.921
- You mean you've been lying to them?
- I just get them in the ballpark.

16:36.080 --> 16:39.402
Enough time's passed and
enough's changed that they bought it.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.440
Why lie?

16:42.840 --> 16:45.286
Buy myself some time, dummy.

16:45.480 --> 16:46.970
Try to find a way to get free.

16:47.960 --> 16:52.887
Wait, so a bunch of innocent people died
so you could buy yourself some time?

16:53.680 --> 16:55.250
Hi. I'm Meg. I'm a demon.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.562
So, what have they found?

17:00.720 --> 17:05.248
Bubkes. Every crypt's been
one Al Capone's vault after another.

17:05.400 --> 17:08.801
And on top of that, someone kept
picking up the trail and icing demons.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.209
I'm guessing that was you, Castiel.

17:12.359 --> 17:15.489
But Crowley just keeps sending more.
He's hell-bent on...

17:15.640 --> 17:19.361
She's gonna tell them the truth.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.165
Do I have to kill her?

17:24.839 --> 17:27.207
She does know
the location of the crypts.

17:27.680 --> 17:30.604
But working with a demon is unclean.

17:30.760 --> 17:33.843
Well, we could use her
as Crowley did.

17:36.120 --> 17:38.009
Agreed.

17:39.960 --> 17:41.564
...Finding that Angel Tablet.

17:45.200 --> 17:46.850
Wait a second.

17:47.320 --> 17:50.403
Did you just say "Angel Tablet"?

17:50.920 --> 17:53.287
You know, I get why Crowley
calls you Moose now.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.241
Yes, Angel Tablet.

17:58.280 --> 18:02.729
Crowley found out Lucifer had it,
figures it's stashed in a crypt.

18:02.880 --> 18:05.531
Well, this is news to me, as well.

18:07.080 --> 18:10.607
Demons I interrogated must have been
lying about their true intentions.

18:10.760 --> 18:12.250
Really?

18:12.520 --> 18:14.807
Because I saw you
Zero Dark Thirty that demon.

18:14.960 --> 18:16.644
You were more than persuasive.

18:18.520 --> 18:20.045
You're both missing the point.

18:20.240 --> 18:23.449
I lied to them, which means
they're digging in the wrong place.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.807
But not for long.
They'll be back here soon.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.125
- So who's up for fleeing?
- She's right.

18:30.280 --> 18:33.443
We need to find those crypts
before they do. Meg...

18:33.600 --> 18:35.523
...you're the only one
who's been there.

18:35.920 --> 18:36.967
We need your help.

18:43.040 --> 18:45.088
Any of you dummies got a map?

18:47.720 --> 18:51.042
- There, that's where the crypt was.
- What's there now?

18:52.400 --> 18:53.890
Do I look like Google to you?

18:55.080 --> 18:57.686
None of these buildings were here
way back in the day.

18:57.840 --> 18:58.966
Figure it out, genius.

18:59.920 --> 19:02.526
Is there any booze in this dump?

19:06.120 --> 19:08.202
- He lied to us.
- Yeah, maybe.

19:08.360 --> 19:12.206
But I can kind of understand why.
I mean, an Angel Tablet?

19:12.360 --> 19:15.921
If the Demon Tablet shuts the gates
of hell, what can the Angel Tablet do?

19:19.560 --> 19:21.562
These wounds have festered.

19:21.760 --> 19:26.004
You really do know how to make
a girl's nethers quiver, don't you?

19:26.160 --> 19:28.049
I am aware of how to do that.

19:29.280 --> 19:33.842
Although it doesn't usually
involve cleaning wounds.

19:34.120 --> 19:36.521
Why are you so sweet on me,
Clarence?

19:38.280 --> 19:40.123
I don't know.

19:41.240 --> 19:43.083
And I still don't know
who Clarence is.

19:44.320 --> 19:47.483
Would it kill you to watch a movie,
read a book?

19:47.640 --> 19:49.449
A movie, no.

19:49.600 --> 19:54.561
But a book with the proper spells,
yeah, could theoretically kill me.

19:54.720 --> 19:57.451
You know, you're much cuter
when you're shutting up.

20:03.480 --> 20:05.721
So which Cass are you now?

20:05.880 --> 20:08.406
Original make and model
or crazy town?

20:11.520 --> 20:12.601
I'm just me.

20:12.760 --> 20:14.728
So your noodle's back in order?

20:16.720 --> 20:20.327
Yeah, my noodle
remembers everything.

20:20.480 --> 20:23.086
- I think it's a pretty good noodle.
- Really?

20:23.280 --> 20:24.770
You remember everything?

20:30.320 --> 20:32.721
If you're referring to the pizza man...

20:33.720 --> 20:35.848
...yes, I remember the pizza man.

20:37.640 --> 20:39.165
And it's a good memory.

20:43.280 --> 20:44.406
Here goes.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.844
All right, according to this...

20:47.000 --> 20:49.446
...the crypt has to be
below an abandoned building.

20:50.480 --> 20:51.606
Good times.

20:51.760 --> 20:56.084
You really think we can trust
Meg-stiel?

20:57.400 --> 20:59.129
No, but what choice do we have?

21:02.960 --> 21:04.803
You ever miss the apocalypse?

21:06.120 --> 21:08.168
No, why would
I miss the end of times?

21:08.320 --> 21:11.005
I miss the simplicity.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.806
I was bad. You were good.
Life was easier.

21:14.560 --> 21:17.404
Now it's all so messy.

21:19.680 --> 21:21.170
I'm kind of good, which sucks.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.565
And you're kind of bad...

21:24.600 --> 21:27.001
...which is actually all manner of hot.

21:30.800 --> 21:34.964
We survive this,
I'm gonna order some pizza...

21:35.120 --> 21:38.567
...and we're gonna move some
furniture around. You understand?

21:39.040 --> 21:40.963
No, I...

21:43.080 --> 21:45.765
Wait, actually, yes, I...

21:45.920 --> 21:49.163
All right. Let's roll, campers.

22:03.440 --> 22:04.487
Sir?

22:05.360 --> 22:08.409
I searched the site top to bottom.

22:08.560 --> 22:09.800
It's empty-

22:10.960 --> 22:12.849
No, there's no crypt there.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.526
And that's not all.

22:16.240 --> 22:19.687
It's just me now, sir. I...

22:19.840 --> 22:22.844
We may have lost Meg.

22:24.120 --> 22:25.326
Sir?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.729
Hello, sir?

22:28.880 --> 22:31.281
Just to be clear...

22:34.200 --> 22:36.851
...you can't find a hole in the ground...

22:37.320 --> 22:41.882
...your coworkers have met with
an untimely demise...

22:45.720 --> 22:49.486
...and you've lost
my favorite chew toy.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.449
Brilliant.

22:55.840 --> 22:58.286
What's that old expression?

22:58.840 --> 23:01.241
"If you want something done right..."

23:09.080 --> 23:11.128
Blah, blah, blah.

23:17.800 --> 23:21.600
So this is it. Basement?

23:21.760 --> 23:24.161
Cass and I will head in,
get our Indiana Jones on.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.651
Sam, stay outside with Meg.

23:25.840 --> 23:26.921
- What?
- We got this.

23:27.080 --> 23:29.242
What? I'm not letting you
go in there alone.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.562
- He won't be alone.
- That's not what I mean.

23:31.760 --> 23:33.444
Meg can hang here, watch our backs.

23:33.640 --> 23:36.564
- Oh, what? Now you trust Meg?
- Hey, I got you this far.

23:36.720 --> 23:38.210
- Shut up...
- Shut up, Meg. Dean...

23:38.360 --> 23:41.284
Sam, I saw your bloody rag
in the trash can, okay?

23:45.360 --> 23:46.441
- That wasn't...
- Stop.

23:47.920 --> 23:50.685
Just stop.
Sam, we don't know what's in there.

23:50.840 --> 23:53.764
Okay? You almost let a demon
get the best of you back there.

23:53.920 --> 23:56.605
- I'm fine.
- No, you haven't been since the first trial.

23:56.760 --> 23:59.081
- That's why I called Cass.
- Trial?

23:59.240 --> 24:00.651
- Shut up, Meg.
- Shut up, Meg.

24:00.800 --> 24:03.690
Dean, I'm telling you, I'm okay.

24:03.840 --> 24:05.683
No, you're not.

24:05.880 --> 24:07.644
Sam...

24:08.120 --> 24:10.202
...you're damaged in ways
even I can't heal.

24:12.760 --> 24:15.730
Dean's right. You should stay here
and protect Meg.

24:16.280 --> 24:18.123
Since when do I need protecting?

24:18.280 --> 24:21.762
Since you were held captive
and tortured for over a year.

24:21.920 --> 24:22.967
Touché.

24:26.200 --> 24:27.611
All right, we'll be back.

24:44.680 --> 24:47.604
Hey, what did you mean
back there about Sam?

24:47.920 --> 24:52.244
It's difficult to say. It's something
on the subatomic level.

24:52.400 --> 24:55.882
- And his electromagnetic field...
- Okay, bottom-line it for me, Bill Nye.

24:56.040 --> 24:59.283
- Is it lethal?
- I don't know. Wait.

25:00.480 --> 25:01.561
There's a draft.

25:02.720 --> 25:05.121
There's something behind there.

25:07.400 --> 25:08.447
Stand back.

25:17.760 --> 25:20.206
Wait, so I took how many bullets
for you guys...

25:20.360 --> 25:22.647
...and you didn't even look for me?

25:24.600 --> 25:25.647
Like, once?

25:29.400 --> 25:31.528
My hero.

25:33.760 --> 25:38.084
What's with all the "trial"
and "being damaged" crap?

25:39.240 --> 25:41.766
Look, no disrespect,
but you haven't exactly been...

25:41.920 --> 25:45.163
...the most trustworthy person
in our lives, Meg.

25:45.320 --> 25:46.606
You're not gonna tell me?

25:48.200 --> 25:51.409
Seriously? How am I not Team Sam?

25:56.360 --> 25:57.486
Fine.

25:58.080 --> 26:01.368
Whatever it is, you okay dying over it?

26:06.560 --> 26:08.210
You don't want to say, fine.

26:08.360 --> 26:11.762
But remember, I spent time
in that walking corpse of yours.

26:11.960 --> 26:14.247
I know your sad little thoughts
and feelings.

26:15.600 --> 26:16.806
That's creepy.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.450
Here's what I remember.

26:20.640 --> 26:24.008
Deep down in parts you never
let see the light of day...

26:24.160 --> 26:28.768
...you want to live a long normal life
away from creepy old things like me.

26:32.080 --> 26:33.320
Yeah, I do.

26:35.160 --> 26:39.131
You know, I spent last year
with someone...

26:40.920 --> 26:43.400
...and now I know
that's actually possible.

26:43.560 --> 26:45.881
Wait, that's how you spent
your last year?

26:46.080 --> 26:48.447
With a chick? Lame.

26:49.400 --> 26:52.006
You know,
how about we just wait quietly?

26:52.160 --> 26:54.367
What was her name?

26:54.520 --> 26:56.284
You don't even trust me with a name?

26:56.440 --> 26:58.408
Cut me, do I not bleed, Sam?

27:01.000 --> 27:04.129
So some chick actually
got you off hunting, huh?

27:04.280 --> 27:05.850
That's one rare creature.

27:06.960 --> 27:10.169
Tell me, how'd you meet this unicorn?

27:26.880 --> 27:27.927
I found it.

27:33.360 --> 27:36.364
Tell the Winchester the crypt is empty,
then come back for it.

27:36.520 --> 27:39.330
- It's warded against angels.
- You can come back...

27:39.480 --> 27:43.690
Crowley's demons are still in town. We're
running out of time. What should I do?

27:44.560 --> 27:45.925
Handle it.

27:46.080 --> 27:47.889
Dean...

27:49.240 --> 27:50.924
...that's it.

27:53.560 --> 27:55.847
How do you know?

27:56.000 --> 27:58.731
It's the only thing in here
warded against angels.

28:35.560 --> 28:37.483
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

28:42.920 --> 28:44.445
Good.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.162
Hand it to me and I'll take it to heaven.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.971
No, we will take it to Kevin
so he can translate.

28:56.120 --> 28:57.565
Right.

28:57.720 --> 29:00.405
Of course,
I'll take it to him right away.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.006
No time to waste.

29:03.840 --> 29:05.171
Well, he's not that far.

29:06.040 --> 29:09.886
I've been meaning to go check on him,
bring him some supplies.

29:10.040 --> 29:12.566
If the demons get their hands
on the Angel Tablet...

29:12.720 --> 29:15.929
...they'll kill us all.
They'll destroy heaven.

29:16.480 --> 29:18.448
I can reason with Dean.

29:18.600 --> 29:21.046
- He's a good man.
- Kill him.

29:21.200 --> 29:23.680
I can resupply the prophet, Dean.

29:25.200 --> 29:29.285
You know, why don't Sam and I
take it over to him...

29:29.440 --> 29:32.364
...and you can get back
to your mission?

29:32.520 --> 29:36.411
Finding the other half of the
Demon Tablet, that is priority, isn't it?

29:38.520 --> 29:40.409
I can't let you take that, Dean.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.206
Can't or won't?

29:44.400 --> 29:45.447
Both.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.042
How did you get out
of purgatory, Cass?

29:58.000 --> 29:59.331
There has to be another way.

29:59.520 --> 30:01.682
You have done this
a thousand times, Castiel.

30:02.560 --> 30:03.607
You're ready.

30:04.440 --> 30:09.651
Kill him. Then take the tablet
and bring it home where it belongs.

30:09.800 --> 30:12.280
Just tell me
how you got out of purgatory.

30:12.560 --> 30:15.723
Be honest with me for the first time
since you've been back...

30:15.880 --> 30:17.723
...and this is yours.

30:21.600 --> 30:24.331
Wait, hold on.
There's one part I don't understand.

30:25.280 --> 30:27.203
You hit a dog and stopped. Why?

30:30.000 --> 30:33.163
That whole story,
and that's your takeaway?

30:33.320 --> 30:34.446
Oh, I heard the rest.

30:34.640 --> 30:38.167
You fell in love with a unicorn.
It was beautiful, then sad, then sadder.

30:38.320 --> 30:41.688
I laughed, I cried,
I puked in my mouth a little.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.888
And honestly, I kind of get it.

30:48.240 --> 30:49.287
Really?

30:53.640 --> 30:55.165
We've got company.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.322
Cass, Cass, I don't know
what the hell is wrong with you...

31:02.480 --> 31:06.246
...but if you're in there and you can hear
me, you don't have to do this.

31:06.400 --> 31:07.890
Cass.

31:08.040 --> 31:09.849
- This isn't right.
- Do you realize...

31:10.000 --> 31:12.287
...what that tablet can do for us?
- I...

31:12.440 --> 31:15.171
- For heaven?
- I won't hurt Dean.

31:15.320 --> 31:17.004
Yes, you will.

31:17.920 --> 31:20.082
- You are.
- Cass, fight this. This is not you.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.689
Fight it.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.643
What have you done to me?

31:26.800 --> 31:28.165
Just relax, Castiel.

31:28.360 --> 31:31.807
Let your vessel do what you know
deep down is the right thing.

31:31.960 --> 31:34.611
What have you done to me, Naomi?

31:34.760 --> 31:36.922
- Who's Naomi?
- What have I done to you?

31:37.800 --> 31:40.485
Do you have any idea
what it's like out there?

31:40.640 --> 31:44.929
There's blood everywhere,
and it's on your hands.

31:45.080 --> 31:49.290
After everything you did to us,
to heaven.

31:50.560 --> 31:54.201
I fixed you, Castiel. I fixed you.

32:06.080 --> 32:07.764
Cass.

32:32.360 --> 32:35.728
I believe they're playing my song.

32:42.120 --> 32:44.771
You want it, take it.

32:46.240 --> 32:48.288
But you're gonna have to kill me first.

32:49.240 --> 32:50.651
Come on, you coward.

32:51.320 --> 32:53.049
Do it. Do it.

32:59.200 --> 33:01.282
- Please.
- End this, Castiel.

33:05.560 --> 33:09.770
Cass, this isn't you. This isn't you.

33:09.960 --> 33:13.248
Bring me the tablet.

33:15.520 --> 33:17.841
Cass. Cass.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.644
I know you're in there.

33:20.800 --> 33:22.962
I know you can hear me.

33:24.480 --> 33:27.086
Cass, it's me.

33:29.280 --> 33:30.770
We're family.

33:32.640 --> 33:34.369
We need you.

33:35.680 --> 33:37.011
I need you.

33:37.200 --> 33:41.330
You have to choose, Castiel,
us or them.

33:43.320 --> 33:44.401
DEAN Cass.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.322
Castiel.

34:16.480 --> 34:18.687
Castiel!

34:28.280 --> 34:29.964
Cass?

34:30.639 --> 34:33.688
No, Cass, Cass.

34:44.159 --> 34:46.242
I'm so sorry, Dean.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.768
What the hell just happened?

34:49.520 --> 34:51.841
Love what you've done with the place.

34:52.800 --> 34:55.963
You really think all that
was gonna keep me out forever?

34:56.120 --> 34:58.088
At least long enough for
Dean and Cass...

34:58.280 --> 35:01.011
- ...to get the tablet and get out.
- Castiel.

35:01.200 --> 35:05.728
So that's who's been poking my boys,
and not in a sexy way.

35:06.360 --> 35:08.089
Got a bone to pick with you, Moose.

35:10.040 --> 35:12.008
After what you did to my poor dog.

35:12.160 --> 35:14.925
You gonna talk us to death
or get down to it already?

35:16.040 --> 35:17.485
There's my whore.

35:18.760 --> 35:21.491
I'm not here
for my dearly departed, though.

35:21.680 --> 35:24.729
I'm here for the stone
with the funny scribbles on it.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.161
That's not gonna happen.

35:27.200 --> 35:28.804
Love it when you get all tough.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.042
Touches me right where
my bathing suit goes.

35:34.360 --> 35:35.486
Go.

35:35.640 --> 35:39.008
Save your brother and my unicorn.

35:44.640 --> 35:46.847
Timon and Pumbaa...

35:47.720 --> 35:49.085
...tell you their big plan?

35:51.880 --> 35:54.247
Did they share
that little chestnut with you?

35:56.520 --> 35:59.842
They mean to close
the gates of hell, sweetheart.

36:01.840 --> 36:05.765
They mean to kill me
and all the demons, you included.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.971
You had me at "kill you," Crowley.

36:14.440 --> 36:20.129
So, Naomi has been controlling you
since she got you out of purgatory?

36:20.320 --> 36:21.651
Yeah.

36:22.600 --> 36:24.170
Well, what broke the connection?

36:25.600 --> 36:27.489
I don't know.

36:29.320 --> 36:31.891
I just know that
I have to protect this tablet now.

36:33.400 --> 36:36.165
- From Naomi?
- Yes.

36:39.400 --> 36:41.129
And from you.

36:43.120 --> 36:45.248
From me?
What are you talking about?

36:47.880 --> 36:49.484
Cass?

36:50.080 --> 36:52.481
- Cass? Damn it.
- Dean.

36:53.120 --> 36:57.523
- Dean. Where's Cass?
- He's gone.

36:57.680 --> 37:00.365
- Meg?
- We gotta go now.

37:09.560 --> 37:12.848
I could beat on you for eternity.

37:13.640 --> 37:17.486
Take all the time you want, you pig.

37:20.680 --> 37:22.045
No Cass in the backseat.

37:22.680 --> 37:24.842
Your stone is long gone.

37:52.640 --> 37:54.642
Naomi.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.522
Fancy meeting you here.

37:57.680 --> 38:00.047
Haven't seen you in a dark age.

38:01.600 --> 38:02.840
Love the haircut.

38:04.160 --> 38:05.491
How's the shoulder?

38:06.640 --> 38:08.085
Just a flesh wound.

38:09.760 --> 38:12.604
Now, I don't have the tablet.

38:12.760 --> 38:15.525
And if you're here, neither do you.

38:15.680 --> 38:19.651
Which means that your Castiel
is in the wind with our prize.

38:19.800 --> 38:23.441
If I didn't know you better,
I'd say you're losing your touch.

38:24.200 --> 38:25.850
Castiel isn't in the wind.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.241
He's doing exactly
what he's supposed to do...

38:28.880 --> 38:30.928
- ...protect the tablet.
- Even from you?

38:33.160 --> 38:34.207
Easy, love.

38:35.120 --> 38:37.726
If you remember our time
in Mesopotamia the way I do...

38:37.880 --> 38:41.089
...you know I'm a lover,
not a fighter.

38:41.240 --> 38:43.481
What do you want, you cockroach?

38:45.920 --> 38:51.245
Maybe we can make a deal
before this gets truly bollocksed.

38:51.400 --> 38:54.609
I mean, I must have something
that you want.

38:58.280 --> 39:00.009
Tart stole my move.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.924
So, what happened?

39:10.080 --> 39:13.004
I mean, Cass touched the tablet...

39:13.200 --> 39:15.885
...and it reset him to his
factory settings or something?

39:16.080 --> 39:17.844
I don't know and I don't care.

39:18.040 --> 39:23.365
All I know is that he is off
the reservation with a heavenly WMD.

39:26.400 --> 39:29.927
Listen, man, I can't take
any more lies from anyone.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.205
Yeah. Um...

39:41.360 --> 39:43.044
I know.

39:46.240 --> 39:47.969
I'm sorry.

39:48.480 --> 39:51.962
I should have told you.
I just wanted to believe I was okay.

39:52.120 --> 39:54.122
- I don't know.
- You heard what Cass said.

39:54.280 --> 39:57.329
That that first trial hurt you in ways
that even he can't heal.

39:59.040 --> 40:02.567
Sammy, I need you to be honest
with me from here on out, man.

40:03.440 --> 40:04.965
You're right.

40:05.120 --> 40:07.168
And I will be.

40:09.160 --> 40:13.290
I may not be able to carry the burden
that comes along with these trials.

40:14.400 --> 40:16.323
But I can carry you.

40:20.840 --> 40:24.686
You realize you kind of just quoted
Lord of the Rings, right?

40:24.840 --> 40:27.241
Come on, man.
But it's the Rudy Hobbit, all right?

40:27.440 --> 40:29.363
Rudy Hobbit always gets a pass.

40:29.520 --> 40:31.409
Shut up.
