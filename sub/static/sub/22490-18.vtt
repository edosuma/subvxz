the world of breakfast sausages.

05:16.949 --> 05:19.281
They're tasty!
Don't believe me?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.514
Listen to these breakfast fans!

05:21.554 --> 05:25.684
Oh, hello.
I did not notice you... there.

05:25.725 --> 05:28.353
I'm a fan... of sausage.

05:28.394 --> 05:34.026
I like Keanu's sausage... the best!
... to eat!

05:35.335 --> 05:39.294
They are so juicy. I cannot
start the day without...

05:39.339 --> 05:42.433
an amazing sausage
in my mouth.

05:42.475 --> 05:46.775
That's where Keanu comes in.

05:49.415 --> 05:51.713
Wow. That's good sausage!

05:57.690 --> 06:00.488
Oh, very good, Billy.

06:02.395 --> 06:04.829
Just delightful, Judy.

06:04.864 --> 06:08.265
Excellent, Emilie.

06:09.736 --> 06:12.466
Ok people,

06:12.505 --> 06:15.770
- Where are the plans?
- What?

06:15.808 --> 06:18.709
- Where are the plans?
- I... I don't... I don't know...

06:18.745 --> 06:21.179
Plans!

06:21.214 --> 06:23.307
Kinda busy here Chief!

06:24.417 --> 06:28.410
Wow, wow, wait, wait.
Did you say Eisenhower Middle School?

06:28.454 --> 06:32.447
Um, uh, sorry everyone.
Just a drill.

06:36.462 --> 06:38.794
Mrs. Dorsey?

06:38.831 --> 06:41.766
What happens when 200
monkeys are set loose...

06:41.801 --> 06:43.200
on a deserted island?

06:43.236 --> 06:46.399
And what happens
if that island is booby-trapped...

06:46.439 --> 06:49.135
with thousands of landmines?

06:49.175 --> 06:51.700
<i>Crazy Monkeys on Landmine Island!</i>

06:51.744 --> 06:55.874
When subterranean munitions meet
those semi-intelligent simians...

06:55.915 --> 06:58.645
the results are outrageously loud!

07:10.997 --> 07:14.558
And the party really gets started
when Snoop Dogg makes the scene!

07:14.600 --> 07:17.160
Hey y'all, snibbity diggity.

07:17.203 --> 07:20.263
<i>Crazy Monkeys on Landmine Island!</i>

07:20.306 --> 07:23.833
Michael Flatley is
the lord of the dance.

07:25.645 --> 07:29.046
Darth Vader is the lord of the Sith.

07:32.185 --> 07:35.120
Like dude, what are we doin' here?

07:35.154 --> 07:37.019
Camp Crystal Lake...

07:37.056 --> 07:41.083
supposedly haunted
by a machete-wielding spook

07:41.127 --> 07:43.721
named Jason Vorhees.

07:43.763 --> 07:47.665
We should make like hockey
sticks and get the puck outta here!

07:47.700 --> 07:48.826
Well hello there!

07:48.868 --> 07:51.063
It's Don Knott and Phyllis Diller.

07:51.103 --> 07:52.695
We're the camp councilors.

07:52.738 --> 07:57.175
Of course after this gig, I'm the
one who's gonna need counseling!

07:57.210 --> 07:58.541
I suggest we split up!

07:58.578 --> 08:00.443
Shaggy and Scooby
you check the campground.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.913
Velma, you check the woods.

08:01.948 --> 08:03.779
Daphne and I will check out the bunkhouse...

08:03.816 --> 08:06.011
and have some of that
nice sex until you get back.

08:06.052 --> 08:08.577
Sex? You? With her?

08:08.621 --> 08:12.148
But with that dickey, you couldn't
even bag an old bag like me!

08:13.960 --> 08:17.589
It's an ascot, you old whore! An ascot!

08:17.630 --> 08:21.726
Well, your "ascot" laid out
by this old whore, dickey.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.698
This place gives me like the heebie jeebies!

08:25.738 --> 08:26.727
Ruh-huh!

08:26.772 --> 08:28.330
Rooby snack!

08:28.374 --> 08:30.342
Oh, yeah, yo boy!

08:30.376 --> 08:35.177
Man... I am one sad, dog food eating hippie!

08:36.482 --> 08:39.542
Like, sorry man. My mistake.

08:39.585 --> 08:43.611
The killer!
Run Scoob!

08:56.836 --> 08:58.827
Better Shaggy than me.

09:01.140 --> 09:03.700
Gosh Freddy! Are we really
gonna go all the way?

09:03.743 --> 09:06.507
If one more person
says something about my ascot...

09:06.546 --> 09:08.377
I'll... damn it's fashionable!

09:11.050 --> 09:14.884
That must be Jason's dead mother!

09:14.921 --> 09:16.218
This explains everything.

09:18.624 --> 09:20.785
That must be Jason's dead mother!

09:20.826 --> 09:22.794
This explains everything.

09:22.828 --> 09:25.820
Fred, you're an asshole!
And that ascot makes you look gay.

09:27.676 --> 09:30.102
Her first! Kill her first!

09:35.708 --> 09:38.973
The virgin always lives the
longest in these horror movies!

09:39.011 --> 09:40.706
God, my life sucks!

09:40.746 --> 09:42.213
You think your life sucks?

09:42.248 --> 09:45.775
One of my apartment tenants
might be a flaming homo.

09:45.818 --> 09:48.252
And that ain't it all.
Somebody killed me!

10:01.801 --> 10:05.032
Now, we'll see
who Jason Voorhees really is.

10:05.071 --> 10:08.598
Old man Phillips? But why?

10:08.641 --> 10:12.042
Spanish doubloons
worth hundreds of dollars...

10:12.078 --> 10:13.875
are sitting at the bottom of the lake.

10:13.913 --> 10:18.213
They would have all mine
if it weren't for you meddling kids.

10:18.250 --> 10:21.879
A bunch of coins?
All my friends are dead!

10:21.921 --> 10:25.652
They're dead
and I am still a virgin. A virgin!

10:25.691 --> 10:27.886
You know, we can fix that.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.322
Your skin is... soft.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.597
Oh... my sweet.

10:38.037 --> 10:40.403
- Oh, wow.
- Yes.

10:40.439 --> 10:42.566
I know a lot about pleasing a young child.

10:42.608 --> 10:45.577
Give it to me, wise man.
Give it to me.

10:45.611 --> 10:47.135
Ok, here you go.

10:48.881 --> 10:51.042
Oh, I think I've got a clue.

10:51.083 --> 10:54.280
I've got little to no sensation
in lower half of my body.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.255
- Oh... oh...
- Yeah, yeah!

10:57.289 --> 11:00.588
- What a mystery
- That's what I'm talking about.

11:00.626 --> 11:02.059
- Yeah.
- It's good!

11:03.295 --> 11:05.763
- Oh!
- Oh, this is gonna be a long one.

11:05.798 --> 11:08.961
- Oh, my keyhole!
- Ouch, my back is...

11:09.001 --> 11:11.299
Oh...

11:12.338 --> 11:13.703
Stupid monkey.
