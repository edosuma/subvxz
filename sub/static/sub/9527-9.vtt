WEBVTT

00:01.251 --> 00:02.627
You know, the reason it's called "bullseye"

00:02.711 --> 00:04.337
is because in early Spain,

00:04.421 --> 00:06.673
they'd throw darts in the bulls' eyes,

00:06.757 --> 00:08.132
and that would make them run, and then

00:08.217 --> 00:09.801
-running of the bulls, so...
-Wow.

00:10.302 --> 00:11.678
-That makes sense.
-Crazy, huh?

00:11.762 --> 00:13.179
Blake, you might be the best

00:13.263 --> 00:14.806
at making facts up, and I mean that.

00:14.890 --> 00:16.349
It's true, I saw it on History Channel.

00:17.142 --> 00:18.768
-You're up.
-No, I can't. I threw out my back last night

00:18.852 --> 00:20.311
fugging my Fleshlight.

00:20.604 --> 00:21.771
-That shouldn't happen.
-Oh, that'll happen.

00:21.897 --> 00:24.315
What sucks is I can't even
afford the back-upuncture to fix it.

00:24.983 --> 00:27.568
-It's like ObamaCare, right?
-Tell me about it.

00:29.071 --> 00:30.238
Unless...

00:30.322 --> 00:31.739
All right. Hum it in.

00:31.824 --> 00:34.867
Hum it in right here.
Dart me down, my brother.

00:35.285 --> 00:36.577
I don't know if this is...

00:36.662 --> 00:38.454
I could sever your spine or something, right?

00:38.831 --> 00:40.540
No, there's too much meat around it.

00:40.624 --> 00:43.459
Oh, yeah, and then
he could have a cool Professor X wheelchair.

00:43.585 --> 00:45.795
You guys need to chill out.
Back-upuncture,

00:45.879 --> 00:47.213
It's just needles, correct?

00:47.297 --> 00:49.590
And what are darts but wing-ed needles?

00:50.467 --> 00:52.927
Okay?
So just dip it in some beer and disinfect it

00:53.011 --> 00:54.637
and then hum it in there!

00:55.055 --> 00:57.640
Yep. Uh... On three.

00:57.808 --> 00:59.976
-Whoo!
-One... Two...

01:00.144 --> 01:01.394
-Three!
-You know what, on second thought...

01:01.478 --> 01:03.688
Oh! Ahhh! What the hell?

01:04.106 --> 01:05.231
Did you just throw that dart?

01:05.315 --> 01:07.233
Nah. Hell, no!

01:07.317 --> 01:10.903
I got a dart hanging outta my face!

01:11.280 --> 01:13.740
Yes, you do. But look at it this way,

01:13.824 --> 01:16.159
we just saved you a trip
to Claire's, am I right?

01:17.828 --> 01:19.078
-'Cause...
-No?

01:19.329 --> 01:20.580
That's it. You're dead!

01:24.752 --> 01:26.669
I'm fresh

01:27.379 --> 01:29.464
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta, gotta

01:29.548 --> 01:30.798
Gotta be fresh

01:32.801 --> 01:34.302
-Whoa...
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:34.386 --> 01:36.262
-You guys gotta go.
-Get 'em outta here!

01:36.346 --> 01:38.556
Hey, hey, easy, easy. Keith, they're with me.

01:38.974 --> 01:40.767
Sorry about that, Hilary.

01:40.851 --> 01:43.060
Just let me know if you need anything.

01:43.145 --> 01:45.438
Uh, well, how about a round
of lemon drops for us?

01:45.522 --> 01:48.107
And put all of dart face's drinks on my tab.

01:48.192 --> 01:49.609
How 'bout some chicken fingers?

01:49.693 --> 01:51.527
Yeah. Well, whatever you want.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.112
Sick.

01:53.197 --> 01:54.614
Okay.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.532
Thank you for saving us with that guy.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.618
-Yeah.
-Actually, you kinda saved him

01:58.702 --> 02:00.787
from us, 'cause I would
have tae kwon do kicked him

02:00.871 --> 02:02.455
right in the freakin' tummy,

02:02.539 --> 02:04.290
probably made him dump out in his pants.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.833
Yep. Just poop all over himself.

02:05.918 --> 02:07.627
Yeah, like Hong Kong Pooey.

02:07.711 --> 02:09.003
Very funny word play.

02:09.087 --> 02:11.088
-Oh, that's very funny!
-Points, points.

02:11.173 --> 02:12.298
-Thanks.
-That's awesome,

02:12.382 --> 02:14.050
because normally women aren't funny,

02:14.134 --> 02:16.302
-and that's a rule.
-Here you go, Miss Winthrop.

02:16.929 --> 02:17.970
-Thanks.
-All right.

02:18.055 --> 02:20.473
And we're working on those tenders
and those dipping sauces.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.225
-Thanks, man.
-Cheers, guys.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.185
-Cheers.
-Thank you.

02:24.269 --> 02:25.728
-I finished first.
-I'm sorry.

02:25.813 --> 02:28.231
Did he say Miss Winthrop, as in...

02:28.774 --> 02:30.316
Ted Winthrop?

02:30.400 --> 02:32.151
Yeah, yeah, that's my dad.

02:32.236 --> 02:35.655
-I'm Hilary. This is my friend Jackie.
-Hi. Yeah, no...

02:35.739 --> 02:37.657
Your dad's the king of Rancho!

02:37.741 --> 02:38.950
-Oh...
-Right? I mean...

02:39.034 --> 02:41.160
Garbage trucks, gas stations,
Payless shoe stores.

02:41.245 --> 02:42.328
Yep.

02:42.412 --> 02:43.830
Yeah, that's right!
The big three, huh?

02:43.914 --> 02:47.792
I'm sure Obama picks up
his phone calls pretty quick.

02:47.876 --> 02:50.711
If Obama would ever pick up the damn phone!

02:51.380 --> 02:52.505
Keep the change!

02:54.550 --> 02:55.550
I didn't vote.

02:55.634 --> 02:57.927
Who votes?
Do you guys want to get some more drinks?

02:58.011 --> 02:59.136
Then we'll party a little bit?

02:59.388 --> 03:00.555
-Yes!
-Whoo!

03:00.639 --> 03:02.181
-Yes!
-And some dipping sauces.

03:03.934 --> 03:07.311
I think you're freaky
and I like you a lot

03:07.396 --> 03:10.857
I think you're freaky
and I like you a lot

03:10.941 --> 03:14.360
I think you're freaky
and I like you a lot

03:14.695 --> 03:18.155
I think you're freaky
and I like you a lot

03:30.043 --> 03:31.210
Whoa!

03:31.295 --> 03:32.795
I think you're freaky
and I like you a lot

03:32.880 --> 03:35.923
Oh, my God! I did that to a real girl!

03:36.008 --> 03:39.051
-We shut it down.
-Tonight was really fun, guys.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.553
I had so much fun with you!

03:40.637 --> 03:42.013
Oh, God, you smell like puke.

03:42.097 --> 03:43.055
-Do I?
-Yeah.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.807
It's just my armpit.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.853
-No, no, no, no, no!
-Stop, dude.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.813
This might be a little crazy, but...

03:50.898 --> 03:52.899
I'm going to my sister's
wedding this weekend,

03:52.983 --> 03:54.817
and I was wondering

03:54.902 --> 03:56.110
if maybe you'd want to be my date.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.362
I do...

03:59.573 --> 04:00.948
Want to go with you,

04:01.033 --> 04:04.577
my sweet mistress or lady or...

04:04.661 --> 04:06.621
- My sweet lady!

04:07.080 --> 04:09.624
Well, you guys, you guys
are totally invited too.

04:09.708 --> 04:12.251
Oh, tight! Yes, I do.

04:12.336 --> 04:14.086
- That's sick!
- Well, uh...

04:14.171 --> 04:15.880
We'll see you there.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.845
Okay, bye.

04:25.015 --> 04:26.015
Hilary, wait.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.850
-Hmm?
-I never caught your name.

04:30.854 --> 04:33.940
Um, I think... I think you did,
'cause you, well, you just said it.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.275
-Yeah, I know, I know.
-Okay!

04:36.360 --> 04:37.944
No, I remember! All right.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.612
- Okay, I'll see you there.
- All right, later. See you soon.

04:39.696 --> 04:40.905
Yeah, later, Silary.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.823
-Take care.
-This is 'bout to be dope.

04:42.908 --> 04:44.784
Yeah, dude, are you kidding me?

04:44.993 --> 04:47.870
A rich person's wedding, like, come on, man.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.539
They probably serve, like,
tiger meat or something cool.

04:50.624 --> 04:51.791
Ho ho ho ho!

04:51.875 --> 04:53.626
Ho ho ho! Ooh!

04:53.710 --> 04:55.294
Well, we'll never know, because...

04:55.379 --> 04:56.712
We ain't goin'.

04:58.173 --> 04:59.131
Adam!

04:59.216 --> 05:01.133
-Yo.
-Hey, good morning.

05:01.218 --> 05:02.385
Morning.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.095
Now, I know you're sick of hearing it,

05:04.179 --> 05:05.888
but if you'd just hear me out one more time

05:05.973 --> 05:07.223
about why you should go to this wedding...

05:08.392 --> 05:10.184
Yeah, check it out. All right, look.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.103
Here's you, all right?

05:12.187 --> 05:13.396
You go to the wedding.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.314
You bring me and Ders.

05:15.399 --> 05:16.983
- Me Ders!
- Here we are at the wedding!

05:17.067 --> 05:18.651
We kill it. We just destroy.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.861
'Cause everybody loves us
'cause we're great guys.

05:21.071 --> 05:22.905
The Winthrops, they're huge fans!

05:22.990 --> 05:24.156
They're so much fans they're like,

05:24.241 --> 05:26.867
"Dude, move in with us at our house.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.995
"Have as much buffalo chicken pizza

05:29.079 --> 05:31.372
"and videogames as you want.
You can retire early.

05:31.456 --> 05:32.832
"We don't care. Live in our mansion.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.417
"We're all one, big happy family now."

05:34.501 --> 05:36.502
We win. Life rules forever.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.921
That's the big picture, right?
But let's talk about the wedding.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.548
-Weddings rule, dude.
-Let's talk about it.

05:40.632 --> 05:42.091
They've got the best DJs,
you know I'll swing dance.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.177
And then let's talk about garter belts, man.

05:45.262 --> 05:47.013
You know what they can do for your life.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.931
I'm sick of being out there
on the market, you know?

05:49.016 --> 05:50.599
I got a dude-alogical clock that's tickin'!

05:50.976 --> 05:53.269
I don't know, you guys. That girl was, like...

05:53.353 --> 05:54.645
Nasty!

05:54.730 --> 05:58.607
You know? With her disgusting,
gross, greasy-looking hair

05:58.692 --> 06:00.359
and, like, her pizza face,

06:00.444 --> 06:02.111
which just really creeped me out.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.696
She was iggly putrid.

06:03.780 --> 06:05.031
Uh, she was very hot,

06:05.365 --> 06:06.824
and her hair game was on point.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.826
I'm pretty sure she uses Wen by Chaz Dean.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.162
Adam, do not eff this up.

06:11.246 --> 06:13.039
I'm telling you, in Steve Harvey's book,

06:13.415 --> 06:15.041
Act Like a Woman, Think Like a Man,

06:15.125 --> 06:17.251
he says nothing compares to a woman's love.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.420
-He says it!
-Are you denying his genius?

06:19.713 --> 06:21.881
I'm not denying his genius.
Steve Harvey is one.

06:21.965 --> 06:23.591
-Thank you.
-I mean, he's the best host

06:23.675 --> 06:25.259
Family Feud has ever had, I'll admit that.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.803
Mmm... Google Ray Combs
and get back to me, actually.

06:28.305 --> 06:29.930
Well, Richard Dawson, on the other hand,

06:30.015 --> 06:31.849
was in Running Man
and fingered a bunch of those chicks.

06:31.933 --> 06:34.602
A Louie Anderson's a boss.
They had a lot of great hosts.

06:34.686 --> 06:35.811
-True.
-So true.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.147
But... I guess I'm just like,

06:38.982 --> 06:40.399
scared or whatever.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.359
What are you scared of, the conga line?

06:42.444 --> 06:45.237
Come on, it's a frigging wedding, you doofus!

06:45.322 --> 06:47.907
No, I'm not scared of the conga line, Blake.

06:47.991 --> 06:50.993
-Well, what?
-I'm scared that if I go to that wedding...

06:52.412 --> 06:53.746
She's gonna, like, fall for me love-style,

06:53.830 --> 06:55.581
and we're gonna be boyf-girlf.

06:55.665 --> 06:58.626
And if we do that, good-bye, Single Adam!

06:58.710 --> 07:00.002
And that means good-bye us.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.796
Are you ready to say good-bye to us?

07:01.880 --> 07:03.881
Is that what
you guys are ready for?

07:04.674 --> 07:05.966
I mean...

07:08.011 --> 07:09.470
No, let's get some of his chicken real quick.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.475
Hey, buddy. So maybe the end of Single Adam

07:14.559 --> 07:16.352
isn't such a bad thing.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.688
I mean, he's made some pretty
bad decisions in his life, huh?

07:19.773 --> 07:21.941
Yes, Single Adam has.

07:22.025 --> 07:27.279
Remember, he did eat that
toilet donut, and got sick for a week.

07:27.364 --> 07:28.364
Two weeks.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.450
Single Adam did all those whippets
at a 2 Chainz concert

07:31.535 --> 07:33.202
and tried to put his pants
on a police horse, right?

07:33.787 --> 07:35.329
- 2 Chainz?
- Yeah.

07:35.413 --> 07:38.040
Hey, what if we send Single Adam off in style?

07:38.250 --> 07:40.042
Throw him like a bachelor
party or something?

07:40.127 --> 07:42.086
- That's cool!
- When I was 12 years old,

07:42.170 --> 07:44.547
my grandma helped me write
a bachelor party wish list.

07:44.840 --> 07:47.341
If you guys help me get everything on my list

07:47.425 --> 07:49.051
and I can have all of my druthers,

07:49.386 --> 07:50.928
I will go to that wedding with you.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.138
- Awesome.
- Yes! Yes!

07:52.222 --> 07:53.472
-That's cool.
-Let's do it.

07:53.557 --> 07:56.058
I have a list of my druthers in my vault.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.394
Sixty-nine, 69, 420.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.895
Just kidding. It's a drawer.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.522
I keep it close by, 'cause you never know

08:01.606 --> 08:03.440
-when you're gonna get married.
-Sick.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.651
It's in cursive, so this is hard for me.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.027
Okay. Take your time.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.238
"For his bachelor party."

08:10.073 --> 08:11.615
Well, she talks like this.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.285
"For his bachelor party,

08:14.369 --> 08:16.787
"my grandson, Adam DeMamp, would like

08:16.872 --> 08:18.998
"shoot shotguns at things,

08:19.082 --> 08:20.499
"cut a wooden tree down,

08:21.293 --> 08:23.085
"drink with airplane pilots,

08:23.170 --> 08:25.254
"microwave a hamster..."

08:25.338 --> 08:26.964
You know, I think I've outgrown that last one.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.382
- Thank God.
- Okay, right.

08:28.466 --> 08:32.094
And finally, "Get a lap dance on a Gravitron."

08:34.764 --> 08:35.848
-Yeah.
-Okay!

08:35.932 --> 08:37.183
-Cool! Ab... Mmm-hmm.
-Yeah.

08:37.267 --> 08:38.517
If you guys could give me a few minutes,

08:38.602 --> 08:40.895
I need to continue itching my leg.

08:41.104 --> 08:43.022
'Cause my leg is super itchy.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.523
-Sure.
-Bachelor party!

08:44.608 --> 08:47.026
-Bachelor party, baby!
-All right!

08:47.110 --> 08:48.611
- Okay.
- He was jacking off, right?

08:48.695 --> 08:50.362
I'm not... I was not jacking off.

08:50.447 --> 08:53.157
Actually, I just have a rash on my inner thigh

08:53.241 --> 08:54.450
that is questionable,

08:54.534 --> 08:56.535
and I need to rub more cortisone on it.

08:58.079 --> 08:59.580
He's insane

09:03.627 --> 09:04.668
Range is hot!

09:04.753 --> 09:06.670
Pull the refrigerator open.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.464
-Yep. All right.
-Whoo!

09:11.968 --> 09:13.093
Whoo!

09:13.178 --> 09:14.553
-Yes!
-Yay!

09:14.638 --> 09:15.763
That was awesome!

09:16.723 --> 09:18.307
-All right.
-Yeah!

09:18.391 --> 09:20.601
Mmm!

09:20.685 --> 09:23.604
You guys rule, man. Hey, family secret.

09:23.688 --> 09:26.482
My mom actually had an affair with a pilot

09:26.566 --> 09:27.775
for two years.

09:27.859 --> 09:30.027
He must have really plowed her hard, too,

09:30.111 --> 09:32.488
because she was so happy
for those two years.

09:32.989 --> 09:35.115
The family was actually pretty
pumped that it was happening.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.534
My dad wasn't even pissed. Hey...

09:38.828 --> 09:41.163
Could I fly one of your guys's planes?

09:41.748 --> 09:43.999
No, I'm sorry, bud, we can't do it.

09:44.793 --> 09:47.753
Well, what would you do for 100 bones?

09:47.837 --> 09:49.630
-Yeah!
-I'm flying!

09:49.965 --> 09:52.549
-Yeah, you are.
-I'm flying!

09:53.927 --> 09:55.052
-Cool.
-Dude.

09:55.136 --> 09:56.595
I'm having fun. This is a fun bachelor party.

09:56.680 --> 09:57.638
-Yeah?
-Okay, only one more thing

09:57.722 --> 09:59.848
on my list of druthers.

10:00.517 --> 10:03.811
Riding a Gravitron while getting a lap job.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.562
-Yeah, yeah, and dude.
-It's my dream.

10:05.647 --> 10:08.065
We seriously looked into getting a Gravitron,

10:08.149 --> 10:09.441
-but it just...
-We didn't.

10:09.526 --> 10:11.026
It's a Gravitron. We couldn't...

10:12.362 --> 10:15.572
You know what happens if I don't get one
of my druthers, correct, brothers?

10:15.782 --> 10:16.949
Yes, we do, we do.

10:17.033 --> 10:21.120
But, dude, we got you
a filthy stripper that's like also hot

10:21.204 --> 10:23.998
who's got these moves that make you
feel like you're on the Gravitron.

10:24.082 --> 10:26.000
Totally, like she brings a fan out

10:26.084 --> 10:28.335
and it, like, blows her hair, and it's like, ahhh!

10:28.420 --> 10:30.838
And then her boobs go like
at Mach 5 speeds!

10:31.298 --> 10:33.173
Unfortunately, one of my druthers isn't met,

10:33.258 --> 10:34.717
so we're not going to the wedding.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.176
Those were the rules that I've laid.

10:36.261 --> 10:37.511
That's the gauntlet that I laid,

10:37.595 --> 10:39.221
and we can't spill the gauntlet.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.765
I don't know if a gauntlet is spillable or not.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.475
I truly don't even know what a gauntlet is,

10:43.560 --> 10:44.643
but we didn't meet the druthers,

10:44.728 --> 10:46.061
so we're not going to the wedding.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.896
-Mach 5.
-Take me home.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.612
Oh, my God, you guys!

10:57.907 --> 11:00.492
You guys Jamie Kennedy
Experimented me, did you not?

11:00.577 --> 11:02.202
I wish I could say we tried to X you,

11:02.287 --> 11:03.329
but I can't, 'cause we did not.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.080
-Yeah, right. It's you!
-I'm serious.

11:05.749 --> 11:07.249
-For real?
-Yeah.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.293
Oh, there's a note.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.755
Okay, it's in cursive,
so this might take me a second.

11:13.757 --> 11:14.882
"Dear Adam,

11:14.966 --> 11:18.844
"only six people have
ever died on this Gravitron.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.554
"Just kidding only two."

11:20.930 --> 11:22.181
-That's funny.
-Yeah.

11:22.265 --> 11:24.391
"Hope you got all your
droothers..."

11:24.768 --> 11:25.768
-Druthers.
-Druthers.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.353
-Yeah.
-Okay, that makes sense.

11:27.437 --> 11:28.937
"You deserve them. See you at the wedding.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.356
-"Love, Hilary."
-That's the nicest thing

11:30.440 --> 11:32.024
a chick's ever done for a dude in the

11:32.108 --> 11:33.609
-history of the world, right?
-Yeah.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.110
Almost, 'cause in seventh grade,

11:35.195 --> 11:39.615
Melissa McDonald agreed to look at my penis
and my balls for 20 seconds straight.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.408
-Pretty nice.
-Yeah, during a school trip.

11:41.493 --> 11:42.493
-It was like...
-Very nice.

11:42.577 --> 11:43.869
- At that point, now this is.
- Ahem.

11:43.953 --> 11:44.995
This might have taken first place.

11:45.080 --> 11:48.290
Hi. I'm Brooklyn,

11:48.500 --> 11:49.958
your dancer.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.711
- Yes, she is.
- Hello, Brooklyn. I'm Blake.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.421
So, uh, some good news.

11:54.506 --> 11:56.423
Your job should be pretty easy tonight

11:56.508 --> 11:58.634
since there won't be any
gravity holding your clothes on.

12:00.512 --> 12:01.553
It's a Gravitron!

12:01.638 --> 12:03.889
We're lookin' at some booby
'cause of the Gravitron.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.432
-Totally.
-Oh! This is gonna be

12:05.517 --> 12:06.558
the best night of my life!

12:06.643 --> 12:08.310
Yes!

12:09.687 --> 12:10.771
Oh, my God!

12:10.855 --> 12:14.233
I done came down
tip-toeing in my Jordans

12:16.820 --> 12:19.947
Tip-toein' in my foreign
you motherfuckers borin'

12:20.031 --> 12:21.740
You sleeping on me, snorin'

12:21.825 --> 12:23.909
This is the best time of my life!

12:23.993 --> 12:26.078
Tip-toeing in my Jordans

12:26.162 --> 12:29.915
I down came down
Tip-toeing in my Jordans

12:29.999 --> 12:34.002
Just copped a Porsche
Tip-toeing in my foreign

12:34.087 --> 12:36.171
You motherfuckers borin'

12:36.256 --> 12:37.756
This is awesome.

12:37.841 --> 12:39.299
This has been a dream of mine

12:39.384 --> 12:41.051
since I heard about it
in the Penthouse letters.

12:41.302 --> 12:42.970
-Yeah?
-My grandma used to

12:43.054 --> 12:45.347
read them to me so I could
fall asleep more easily.

12:45.723 --> 12:48.350
You all right down there?
'Cause you're not hard.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.269
That's very unlike my dick.

12:50.353 --> 12:52.104
Normally it's just like...

12:52.188 --> 12:53.814
Spitting
all over the place, you know?

12:53.898 --> 12:55.065
Yeah, but it's not...

12:55.150 --> 12:57.109
No. It's like an old taxidermied snake.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.027
-But it isn't.
-It's scared.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.237
Oh, wow, I don't...

13:00.321 --> 13:03.073
Oh, my God. You know what it is?

13:03.867 --> 13:06.743
I'm in love. Guys, I'm in love!

13:06.828 --> 13:08.245
-Oh!
-That's what's happening.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.247
That's why my hog isn't hard right now,

13:10.331 --> 13:11.790
'cause I'm so in love with Hilary.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.041
Of course I'm in love with her,

13:13.126 --> 13:14.793
she gave me a freaking Gravitron, right?

13:14.878 --> 13:17.296
- Yeah. That's beautiful!
- It's cool!

13:17.380 --> 13:19.256
I don't even like this super babe of a stripper!

13:19.757 --> 13:21.258
No offense. Here.

13:21.342 --> 13:22.885
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.136
Just for a minute.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.262
-I need to spend some...
-Sure.

13:25.346 --> 13:26.763
...alone time with my guys.

13:26.848 --> 13:28.557
This might be the last time it's just us,

13:28.641 --> 13:29.850
you know, since I'm gonna be a freakin'

13:29.934 --> 13:31.727
-basically married dude.
-I'll just...

13:32.228 --> 13:35.022
Thank you for doing your
stuff with your body. It's...

13:35.106 --> 13:37.483
-Namaste.
-I normally love glittered women.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.985
-It's no offense.
-Thank you.

13:41.279 --> 13:42.988
-Uh-oh.
-And then there were three, right?

13:44.699 --> 13:47.201
And if you're real quiet,
you can hear wedding bells!

13:47.285 --> 13:49.203
-You sure can.
-I can't hear 'em.

13:49.287 --> 13:52.331
Oh, man, I am so sad to see you go,

13:52.415 --> 13:54.333
but then again, I'm happy,
'cause we're probably

13:54.417 --> 13:56.668
gonna be living together
in a mansion with a butler,

13:56.753 --> 13:59.338
playing video games, not working ever!

13:59.422 --> 14:01.840
Well, thank you guys so much.
And thank you for, like,

14:01.925 --> 14:03.926
doing all this stuff
and giving me all my druthers.

14:04.469 --> 14:07.179
- I really appreciate it!

14:07.263 --> 14:10.390
Ho ho ho ho! Oh, that was awesome!

14:10.475 --> 14:12.351
-You're out of your mind.
-That was awesome!

14:12.435 --> 14:14.311
Hey, to Single Adam!

14:14.395 --> 14:16.063
-Yay!
-Yeah!

14:16.314 --> 14:18.774
-I'll drink to that, dude.
-Signing off.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.527
Forever.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.292
Wake up!

14:37.377 --> 14:39.878
You guys have been in here for like six hours.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.505
I need to be paid.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.383
-Hey, what time is it?
-It's 10:00 am.

14:44.467 --> 14:45.551
- Okay, no.
- What?

14:45.635 --> 14:47.386
I gave you my credit card last night.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.638
Yeah, you did, and it got declined.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.056
You're maxed out.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.475
-So somebody owes me.
-You know what?

14:53.601 --> 14:54.643
I owe you.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.728
You owe me a lot of money, actually, yeah.

14:57.355 --> 14:58.981
What is your real name?

14:59.065 --> 15:00.482
Why do you want to know that?

15:00.567 --> 15:02.442
Because I need to go to that church

15:02.527 --> 15:04.111
and tell my future girlfriend

15:04.195 --> 15:06.572
the name of the woman
I already cheated on her with.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.991
What? No.
Why would you do that? Don't do that.

15:09.075 --> 15:10.242
No, I have to.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.077
I can't start this new chapter of my life

15:12.161 --> 15:14.496
without being forgiven
for these past indiscretions.

15:14.956 --> 15:17.499
Getting a lapper from her,
all those other lappers.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.167
Like so many lappers.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.586
We've gotten so many lappers!

15:20.670 --> 15:22.170
What are you talking about?
Don't be weird, dude.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.755
Promise me you won't ruin this for me.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.424
I'm trying to retire early, man.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.634
That's a little selfish, Blake.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.596
But, yeah... I promise.

15:30.680 --> 15:33.599
I promise that I won't be late to the wedding.

15:33.683 --> 15:35.267
-Come on, Ad...
-Adam!

15:35.351 --> 15:36.643
-I can't...
-Don't push me!

15:36.728 --> 15:39.146
-Will someone just pay me?
-Oh, oh!

15:39.230 --> 15:40.314
Here it comes again!

15:40.398 --> 15:42.316
-Ahhh!
-Ahhh!

15:42.400 --> 15:44.401
It's not on anymore.

15:45.820 --> 15:46.862
-Oh.
-Yeah.

15:54.412 --> 15:55.662
Oh! Jesus!

15:55.747 --> 15:58.206
Don't, don't you do it!

15:58.291 --> 16:02.085
Or do do it, but just wait
till after the garter belt's been tossed.

16:02.170 --> 16:03.462
When am I gonna get paid?

16:03.546 --> 16:05.881
Jesus, Brooklyn, is stripping
just about money to you?

16:05.965 --> 16:07.382
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry, guys,

16:07.467 --> 16:09.551
but you can't stop love!

16:09.802 --> 16:11.637
My whole entire family fortune's in there!

16:11.721 --> 16:12.888
-Adam, stop!
-Wait, wait!

16:13.348 --> 16:14.556
No!

16:17.727 --> 16:19.186
You're being totally selfish.

16:19.270 --> 16:20.812
You guys just don't want to see me happy!

16:20.897 --> 16:22.189
And you don't even understand relationships!

16:22.273 --> 16:23.565
Only me and Steve Harvey do!

16:23.650 --> 16:26.193
You're causing a friendship family feud, dude.

16:26.277 --> 16:27.861
Steve Harvey would never do that!

16:27.945 --> 16:29.613
Nope.

16:29.697 --> 16:31.615
Adam! You get away from here.

16:31.699 --> 16:33.241
Today's not about you, okay?
It's about two people.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.952
The bride and the stud
who catches the garter belt!

16:36.037 --> 16:39.081
Ow! Oh! You back-upunctured me!

16:39.165 --> 16:40.916
And it didn't even hurt. In fact...

16:41.417 --> 16:42.751
It helped my hip.

16:44.087 --> 16:45.128
Come on!

16:50.051 --> 16:51.760
Stop stopping my love!

16:51.844 --> 16:53.011
What the hell are you doing?

16:53.096 --> 16:54.554
Oh, you just said hell!

16:54.639 --> 16:56.056
We're in church, dude. You're going to hell!

16:56.140 --> 16:58.183
People say hell in churches
all the time, you just said it.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.727
Hey! What's going on up there?

17:00.812 --> 17:02.354
-Um...
-Ow!

17:02.438 --> 17:04.106
-Hey, you okay, dude?
-Stop the wedding!

17:04.440 --> 17:05.524
-Stop the wedding!
-Wait...

17:05.608 --> 17:06.775
It is stopped!

17:06.859 --> 17:07.943
Now, will someone please tell me

17:08.027 --> 17:09.194
what the hell is going on up there?

17:09.987 --> 17:11.488
Ah... He just said hell.

17:11.572 --> 17:13.115
-Adam, you made it!
-Oh...

17:13.199 --> 17:15.450
Mom, Dad, um, that's my date.

17:15.785 --> 17:16.868
What it is.

17:16.953 --> 17:18.036
You know this clown?

17:18.538 --> 17:19.663
Mr. Winthrop,

17:20.665 --> 17:21.873
I would like

17:21.958 --> 17:23.291
to ask for your daughter's hand

17:23.376 --> 17:24.626
in being my girlfriend.

17:25.503 --> 17:26.461
But

17:26.546 --> 17:28.505
before I do that, I have to come clean

17:28.589 --> 17:31.717
about some very dastardly
deeds that I have done.

17:31.801 --> 17:34.219
I've gotta be real, I've gotta be honest,

17:34.303 --> 17:36.304
-and I've gotta be open...
-He doesn't.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.223
-...with everyone in the church!
-You don't, you don't.

17:38.307 --> 17:41.393
-Stop!
-Last night, I got a lap job,

17:41.477 --> 17:43.937
which is sort of like
a lap dance but more sexual,

17:44.021 --> 17:45.439
by a girl named Brooklyn.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.399
Oh, that's me!

17:47.483 --> 17:49.818
I'm Brooklyn. I'm the stripper.

17:49.944 --> 17:51.570
-But we did not have sex.
-We didn't.

17:51.654 --> 17:53.155
-He couldn't get it hard.
-Okay, that's not...

17:53.489 --> 17:55.073
Evidently, I'm having a hard time getting hard

17:55.158 --> 17:57.826
as of late, but I hope
your daughter changes that.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.585
You wanna tell me
what the hell you're doing here?

18:06.669 --> 18:08.879
Sir, I need to let you know

18:08.963 --> 18:11.423
that I did not get hard during that lap dance

18:11.591 --> 18:15.886
because the love for
your daughter killed my boner.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.305
Also, I once killed a turtle with...

18:18.389 --> 18:20.766
-Stop talking.
-No, Daddy, Daddy.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.601
That's my boyfriend Adam.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.853
-Boyfriend?
-Isn't he the best? Yeah.

18:25.688 --> 18:27.063
What is this about?

18:27.148 --> 18:29.107
Daddy, I'm just trying to make you proud.

18:29.192 --> 18:31.443
I mean, you were the one
that said I was confused

18:31.527 --> 18:32.819
when I said that I was a lesbian

18:32.904 --> 18:35.280
and in love with Jackie,
and you wanted me to date guys,

18:35.364 --> 18:37.616
and so I picked a guy, and this is my guy.

18:37.700 --> 18:40.076
-She picked me!
-Get over here.

18:40.161 --> 18:42.788
-Get over here.
-Stop, stop, stop it!

18:42.872 --> 18:44.873
Stop it! Okay, okay, you've made your point.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.375
-Huh?
-If you like Jackie that much,

18:47.460 --> 18:49.961
then... Be with Jackie.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.963
Oh, God, thank you. Thank you.

18:52.048 --> 18:53.298
Please get off of me.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.383
Jesus, that was gross.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.469
Oh, she's being funny again.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.346
That's why we love Hilary, she's so funny,

18:59.430 --> 19:01.223
and for a woman, too.

19:01.307 --> 19:02.432
Oh, my God.

19:02.517 --> 19:04.351
Not a comedy routine, dude.

19:04.435 --> 19:06.061
You're a horrible person.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.396
-I love you.
-I love you.

19:08.481 --> 19:09.815
I love you. I love you.

19:10.024 --> 19:11.942
They can be as miserable as the rest of us.

19:12.401 --> 19:13.777
Stop it. Don't hit me with the bouquet.

19:13.861 --> 19:16.071
I'm sorry, can we get back to my wedding?

19:16.447 --> 19:17.697
Oh, it's all about you, isn't it?

19:17.782 --> 19:20.116
Okay, okay, you guys are outta here.

19:20.201 --> 19:22.327
Great call. Love where your head's at.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.496
I'm wondering if,
before we get the wheels really turning,

19:24.580 --> 19:27.165
you could throw out the... Garter belt?

19:27.250 --> 19:29.000
No! Get out!

19:29.085 --> 19:30.627
Totally. I just... Need it!

19:30.711 --> 19:32.963
-No!
-Hey, hey, hey!

19:33.047 --> 19:35.549
- Daddy!

19:35.633 --> 19:36.967
Get off! Get off!

19:37.051 --> 19:38.593
-Get off!
-Define lesbian!

19:38.678 --> 19:40.846
You know what?
I think it worked out for the best.

19:40.930 --> 19:44.266
I'm 25.
I'm too young to have my first girlfriend.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.851
True, man you dodged a bullet, dude.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.394
-Hello.
-What?

19:47.478 --> 19:52.482
Still here. Still need money
for all the lappers that we did.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.025
-Yes, uh...
-All the lappers.

19:54.110 --> 19:56.486
And I still don't have any money.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.614
Well, my friend is getting
married next weekend.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.992
So maybe...

20:02.285 --> 20:05.829
Oh! You...
You want me to go as your date as payment.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.205
Yeah, of course!

20:07.290 --> 20:08.832
-Yeah, that's smart.
-Sick!

20:08.916 --> 20:11.293
Uh, not exactly.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.129
--Hello, everyone, and welcome.

20:14.589 --> 20:17.799
We are gathered here today to celebrate...

20:18.634 --> 20:19.843
Ugh! Ughhh!

20:25.600 --> 20:27.726
Oh! Oh!

20:27.810 --> 20:30.729
Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

20:30.813 --> 20:33.106
Come on! Oh! Oh! Oh!

20:34.942 --> 20:36.526
I'm really bad. I know I'm going to hell.

20:36.611 --> 20:39.571
But I been told my dick's so good
it gotta be goin' to heaven!

20:49.332 --> 20:51.750
Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!

20:51.834 --> 20:55.128
Oh, Jesus! Oh, Jesus, did I shit myself?

20:55.212 --> 20:57.255
Did I shit... Oh, it was you three.

20:57.340 --> 21:00.467
Oh, my God, I thought I shit my pants!
