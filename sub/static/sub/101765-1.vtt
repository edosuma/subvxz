WEBVTT

00:15.016 --> 00:18.851
I wrote a letter
to Santa last night

00:18.986 --> 00:22.187
I told him what I want
to make my Christmas right

00:22.323 --> 00:25.758
But if I don't get it
I'm gonna be blue

00:25.860 --> 00:30.029
I want a rockin' little
Christmas with you

00:30.931 --> 00:33.032
I want a rockin'
little Christmas

00:33.167 --> 00:37.803
Rockin' little
Christmas with you

00:37.905 --> 00:40.172
Oh, if I get my wishes

00:40.307 --> 00:41.907
It's gonna be delicious

00:42.043 --> 00:47.413
A stocking full
of love for two

00:47.581 --> 00:51.650
Baby, what's it gonna be

00:51.685 --> 00:54.720
Where you gonna spend
your Christmas Eve

00:54.855 --> 00:57.689
Will I be married
or will I be blue

00:57.825 --> 01:01.060
I want a rockin' little
Christmas with you

01:01.195 --> 01:03.295
I want a rockin'
little Christmas

01:03.431 --> 01:05.130
Rockin' little Christmas

01:05.266 --> 01:11.003
Rockin' little
Christmas with you

01:11.806 --> 01:13.172
[music stops]

01:13.274 --> 01:14.873
Cut. Let's set
for Blue Christmas.

01:15.009 --> 01:16.308
Okay. Great rehearsal,
everybody.

01:16.343 --> 01:17.976
That was awesome.
Keep it up.

01:18.112 --> 01:20.679
We've got showtime in six days.
I want game speed.

01:20.815 --> 01:22.448
All right, we need
to make sure that the dancers

01:22.583 --> 01:24.083
have rubber grips
on the bottom of their shoes,

01:24.118 --> 01:25.818
and this window
needs way more snow.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.686
There's not enough snow.

01:27.822 --> 01:29.755
Why are these skirts
different colors?

01:29.890 --> 01:30.722
They're not.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.792
They ran out of deep red.

01:33.928 --> 01:35.494
But full red is close enough.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.863
"Close enough"? Close enough
is a slippery slope.

01:37.998 --> 01:39.198
You know what they say
about slippery slopes?

01:39.333 --> 01:40.799
-Great for sledding?
-Luanne.

01:40.935 --> 01:42.634
I got it. I got it. Deep red.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.303
We also need to call
the props guy,

01:44.405 --> 01:46.271
make sure that he looks
at the digital fireplace.

01:46.307 --> 01:47.439
The image is getting very wonky.

01:47.541 --> 01:48.540
You got all that?

01:48.642 --> 01:49.842
Pen's gonna run out of ink.

01:49.977 --> 01:51.643
Appreciate your
hard work, Georgia.

01:51.779 --> 01:54.379
I'm gonna miss you when you
go to law school in the spring.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.181
Right. Um...

01:56.317 --> 01:58.417
about the song and the opener,

01:58.586 --> 01:59.585
people have been talking.

01:59.720 --> 02:00.552
Who?

02:00.688 --> 02:02.254
Okay, it's just me.

02:02.389 --> 02:05.057
Don't you think that the opening
song should be a classic?

02:05.092 --> 02:06.425
Uh, too much baggage.

02:06.594 --> 02:08.527
Sure, "Deck the Halls"
is rife with angst.

02:08.629 --> 02:11.063
Okay, every song has a memory.

02:11.165 --> 02:13.832
So we want people to tune in and
hear "Rockin' Little Christmas"

02:13.868 --> 02:17.636
and think of nothing other than
how much they loved this year's

02:17.771 --> 02:19.037
<i> Country Christmas Live.</i>

02:19.707 --> 02:20.906
To tape.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.075
[scoffs]

02:23.177 --> 02:24.943
Okay, also, Alexis'
manager called.

02:25.079 --> 02:27.513
She wants fruit in her
trailer, but no pineapple.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.515
Absolutely no pineapple.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.183
I think she's allergic.

02:39.393 --> 02:40.993
I was looking
for Belinda Manners.

02:41.996 --> 02:43.128
Behind a giant candy cane?

02:43.764 --> 02:46.265
[chuckles nervously]
Where is she, the North Pole?

02:46.367 --> 02:48.767
Try the gingerbread house.

02:48.903 --> 02:50.969
Could I have your autograph?

02:51.071 --> 02:54.139
Oh. You were serious.
Thanks.

02:54.208 --> 02:55.207
There you go.

02:55.342 --> 02:56.842
Thanks.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.110
[Gavin] Belinda Manners.

02:58.212 --> 02:59.912
Christmas come early.

03:00.047 --> 03:02.080
-Gavin.
-How are you?

03:02.216 --> 03:03.849
Oh, I thought
you got stuck in L.A.

03:04.018 --> 03:06.485
I did, but Santa gave me
a ride on his sleigh.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.654
You crushed this rehearsal.
This was fantastic.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.489
Aw, you're just saying that.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.890
Twelve years your manager.
You think I still lie to you?

03:12.059 --> 03:13.892
Well, I think your talents
have been wasted

03:13.928 --> 03:15.994
by having me
as your only client.

03:16.130 --> 03:18.397
Thank you, but I think
you've kept me pretty busy.

03:18.499 --> 03:21.667
Besides, after booking
the opening spot on
Country Christmas Live,

03:21.802 --> 03:23.435
you're gonna be a lot busier.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.237
Hey, speaking of which,
can you help me with something?

03:25.406 --> 03:26.705
Anything.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.874
It's about the giant
Holly Jollies...

03:29.043 --> 03:30.909
-Billboard. Yeah.
-...billboard.

03:31.045 --> 03:33.145
Is it not just
a little distracting?

03:33.247 --> 03:34.813
It's a lot distracting.
I'll take care of it.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.582
I mean, I know
it's Vivienne's call.

03:38.986 --> 03:39.785
Yes, it is.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.153
Mm-hmm.

03:41.322 --> 03:43.055
We're professionals.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.122
I actually have a meeting
with her tomorrow morning.

03:44.258 --> 03:46.658
-Really?
-Yes. Listen.

03:46.794 --> 03:48.293
I know how important this
opening number is to you,

03:48.429 --> 03:50.095
so don't worry.

03:50.231 --> 03:51.630
It's gonna be a wonderful
experience. You deserve it.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.599
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

03:53.634 --> 03:56.068
Okay, Alexis is up next.
How are we doing?

03:56.203 --> 03:57.369
She's almost ready.

03:57.504 --> 03:59.137
-Great.
-It's my fault, Vivienne.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.939
I've been so nervous
I can't stop fidgeting.

04:00.975 --> 04:03.909
What? Alexis Rinehart nervous?
Who would believe it?

04:04.078 --> 04:06.345
My first album just came out,

04:06.480 --> 04:09.081
and there's all
these expectations.

04:09.149 --> 04:12.084
The most people I've sung for
is church.

04:12.253 --> 04:14.286
[tender music]

04:14.421 --> 04:16.688
I wouldn't have booked you if I
didn't know you could do it.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.157
Okay?

04:19.293 --> 04:20.892
Open your heart to them
and they'll open theirs to you.

04:24.164 --> 04:25.464
[exhales]

04:33.741 --> 04:35.641
You know, Gavin's in town.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.975
I figured.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.610
He asked if you two could talk.

04:38.746 --> 04:40.812
Goodie.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.415
I told him to meet you
tomorrow morning in the
Hall of Fame museum.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.350
Why the museum?

04:45.486 --> 04:47.286
I thought you two
could use some privacy.

04:47.855 --> 04:49.588
Okay.

04:49.690 --> 04:52.057
Uh, this meeting
should be done soon.
I'll see you at home.

04:53.927 --> 04:58.030
[instrumental cover of
"Jingle Bells" plays]

05:01.302 --> 05:04.136
[music continues softly
on record player]

05:08.275 --> 05:10.175
Looks like a blast, Dad.

05:10.311 --> 05:12.344
<i>Oh, it sure is. Thank you</i>
<i>girls so much for this cruise.</i>

05:12.413 --> 05:14.212
-Thank Vivienne.
-No, that was--

05:14.348 --> 05:15.914
Dad, that was from both of us,

05:16.050 --> 05:18.483
and just get back safely
in time for Christmas Eve.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.018
<i> Hey, I'll be the one</i>
<i> with the sunburn.</i>

05:20.788 --> 05:21.720
<i> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>

05:22.389 --> 05:23.689
<i> You're not still working,</i>
<i> are you?</i>

05:23.824 --> 05:26.024
Bye, Dad. Chat soon.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.194
He's right. You should try
sleeping every now and then.

05:29.330 --> 05:31.296
I will make that
a New Year's resolution.

05:31.432 --> 05:32.597
I always went to bed
when you told me to.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.633
Big sister.
Perks of the job.

05:36.770 --> 05:37.703
What are these?

05:40.007 --> 05:41.206
Resumes.

05:41.342 --> 05:43.408
Oh, yeah?
Who are you hiring?

05:43.544 --> 05:46.178
My replacement.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.313
Vivienne.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.215
Okay, I heard from my friend
at the network

05:50.317 --> 05:53.852
I am on the short list to
produce the Icon Music Awards,

05:53.987 --> 05:55.754
So? Do both shows.

05:55.889 --> 05:58.323
I can't. I'd have to move
to L.A. the first week
of January.

05:58.826 --> 06:01.426
I'm sorry. Did you say
you're moving to L.A.?

06:01.562 --> 06:03.328
If I got the job, which I won't.

06:04.465 --> 06:05.597
But probably. [chuckles]

06:05.699 --> 06:07.299
You're serious.

06:07.434 --> 06:08.800
You'd really leave?

06:09.670 --> 06:13.705
Well, it's the IMAs, Georgia.
I can't turn down
an opportunity like that.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.707
Besides, you're going
to law school.

06:15.843 --> 06:19.544
I could sell the house.
Dad could visit us anywhere.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.413
What exactly am I
leaving behind here?

06:21.548 --> 06:23.048
A lifetime of memories?

06:23.150 --> 06:25.984
[tender music]

06:26.120 --> 06:28.553
Okay, you can't get
sentimental about this
kind of stuff, Georgia.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.489
That's when people
take advantage of you.

06:30.624 --> 06:31.890
What about what
you said to Alexis?

06:31.992 --> 06:33.091
Mm.

06:33.227 --> 06:35.026
Seemed pretty sentimental to me.

06:35.162 --> 06:37.763
Please. I just told
a scared young girl
what she needed to hear.

07:31.919 --> 07:33.118
Oh...

07:35.522 --> 07:36.621
[chuckles]

07:52.739 --> 07:56.174
[man on TV] Country
Christmas Live got its
start three decades ago

07:56.310 --> 07:59.044
<i> with executive producer</i>
<i> Marilyn Jinway.</i>

07:59.179 --> 08:01.179
<i>Until her death two years ago,</i>

08:01.315 --> 08:03.782
country Christmas Live
had won over 12...
[continues indistinctly]

08:03.917 --> 08:06.551
The Marilyn Jinway.

08:06.620 --> 08:07.953
[Vivienne] Yeah, my old boss.

08:08.121 --> 08:10.489
Taught me everything I know.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.624
I heard she was a handful.

08:12.659 --> 08:15.093
Well, the special was
on its last legs.
She had to be tough.

08:15.195 --> 08:18.463
Besides, she never let
personal feelings get
in the way of business.

08:19.766 --> 08:21.766
Even when the business
is personal?

08:25.606 --> 08:27.205
You look good.

08:27.307 --> 08:28.406
Excuse me?

08:28.542 --> 08:29.674
You look good.
You look different.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.009
Good different/

08:31.645 --> 08:33.445
Well, I grew up.

08:33.580 --> 08:36.715
[sighs] Well, it's been a while.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.250
Has it?

08:38.352 --> 08:41.319
It has. I can't say
I get back very often, so...

08:41.421 --> 08:44.322
Hmm. You manage a
country music superstar

08:44.424 --> 08:46.358
but don't make it back
to Nashville?

08:46.460 --> 08:48.560
Listen, I-I should have called,
and I wanted to--

08:48.729 --> 08:50.629
Look, we don't need
to get into any of this.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.764
No, no, I-I just got the sense
that you didn't really
want to talk.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.733
Well, yeah.
Not talking would be great.

08:54.801 --> 08:57.869
So then we can work together
and have it not be awkward.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.205
See? Not awkward at all.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.173
So what was it you wanted?

09:03.477 --> 09:05.377
-The opening number.
-What about it?

09:05.412 --> 09:06.478
It needs a dog.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.814
I'm sorry, a d--
a dog?

09:09.950 --> 09:13.184
A dog. Belinda is involved
with several rescue
animal shelters,

09:13.320 --> 09:16.521
and we feel it would
tie into that perfect
Christmas vibe, so...

09:16.623 --> 09:17.656
a dog.

09:18.292 --> 09:19.357
Okay, I'll look into it.

09:19.493 --> 09:20.525
Thank you.

09:20.627 --> 09:21.560
Is there something else?

09:22.529 --> 09:24.829
Nothing major, except
that the billboard
is a major distraction.

09:24.998 --> 09:27.465
Yeah, no, no chance.
Sponsor broke the piggy bank
for that billboard,

09:27.568 --> 09:29.234
so not going anywhere.

09:29.369 --> 09:30.869
The billboard belongs
on Broadway outside
of a honky-tonk.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.371
The billboard stays, so...

09:33.473 --> 09:36.708
if there's anything else
you need, ask Georgia, okay?

09:48.322 --> 09:49.220
-Hey, boss.
-Hmm?

09:49.356 --> 09:50.255
You okay?

09:50.357 --> 09:51.222
What?

09:52.392 --> 09:54.626
Yeah, uh, late night.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.295
Could always wrap early today.

09:57.431 --> 09:58.597
[chuckles] Hilarious.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.299
What is this?

10:01.935 --> 10:03.134
No clue. Um...

10:03.270 --> 10:05.270
Well, did you see
who dropped it off?

10:09.643 --> 10:10.775
Music box.

10:11.511 --> 10:13.812
-For the Toyland sketch.
-Maybe.

10:13.947 --> 10:17.716
["O Come All Ye Faithful" plays]

10:26.860 --> 10:29.361
"O Come All Ye Faithful".

10:29.463 --> 10:30.495
I'm sorry, what?

10:30.597 --> 10:32.430
The song.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.066
I don't hear anything.

10:36.903 --> 10:39.604
Parker, the song coming
from the music box.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.907
Vivienne, I, uh...
I don't hear anything.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.509
Okay, put it in the prop room.

10:44.611 --> 10:46.711
-I'll look at it later.
-Yeah, yeah, okay.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.915
How'd it go with Gavin?

10:51.018 --> 10:53.284
Great, yeah.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.286
He came around to my way
of thinking on the billboard,
so that was good.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.755
The billboard?

10:56.857 --> 10:58.456
Vivienne, I meant how
was it talking to Gavin

10:58.592 --> 11:00.525
one-on-one for the first time
in a decade?

11:00.661 --> 11:02.427
I don't know what
you're talking about.

11:02.529 --> 11:04.796
Sure you don't.

11:04.965 --> 11:08.867
Anyway, that head honcho
you were telling me about,
what was his name? Grass?

Runs the whole network.
what about him?

11:12.272 --> 11:13.738
He's here.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.274
[nervous music]

11:18.011 --> 11:20.979
What--? [clears throat]

11:23.216 --> 11:24.249
Mr. Moss?

11:24.351 --> 11:25.817
Ah, you must be Vivienne Wake.

11:25.952 --> 11:26.951
Yes.

11:27.087 --> 11:27.819
Pleasure to meet you.

11:27.954 --> 11:29.521
Likewise.

11:29.623 --> 11:31.489
To what do we owe this honor?

11:31.525 --> 11:33.958
I'm only used to working with
people in the Nashville office.

11:34.094 --> 11:36.861
Well, I heard good things,
wanted to come down
and see for myself.

11:37.831 --> 11:39.664
I'm flattered.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.866
In fact, several
board members flagged you
for a project in L.A.

11:42.602 --> 11:43.968
Really?

11:44.071 --> 11:45.904
I trust you won't mind
if I linger a bit?

11:46.006 --> 11:47.038
Watching you work?

11:47.140 --> 11:49.307
No, of course not. Um...

11:49.409 --> 11:53.044
Stacy? Hi. Can you find
an empty dressing room
for Mr. Moss, please?

11:53.146 --> 11:54.813
Oh, please, call me Henry.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.449
-Henry.
-Okay. [chuckles]

12:00.854 --> 12:02.721
[exhales]
I mean, first Gavin,

12:02.856 --> 12:04.556
now I have the head of the
network breathing down my neck?

12:04.658 --> 12:05.623
At least they're giving you
the job, right?

12:05.759 --> 12:07.358
I don't know.

12:07.527 --> 12:08.393
-They wouldn't be here if--
-I said I don't know.

12:08.528 --> 12:09.894
Okay.

12:12.432 --> 12:13.498
Um...

12:16.002 --> 12:16.835
These are real.

12:17.804 --> 12:19.304
We get hungry
while we're working.

12:19.406 --> 12:22.340
So we're just leaving
cookies out all day now?

12:22.476 --> 12:24.008
No, we just thought that--

12:24.044 --> 12:28.513
Okay, this is not the jug
that we... decided on.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.014
We had some extra paint.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.817
Okay.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.953
Do I have to do
everything myself?

12:38.959 --> 12:41.426
I'm gonna go wash my hand.
I'm sorry.

12:41.561 --> 12:42.594
It's okay.

12:46.466 --> 12:50.135
[string rendition

12:53.073 --> 12:54.205

[Priscilla on phone] Gavin.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.342

<i> to Nashville in one piece.</i>

12:57.477 --> 12:59.744
Yeah. Thank you.
So far, so good.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.412
We're still on for dinner
tonight, though, right?

13:01.548 --> 13:02.947
<i> Yeah. Yeah.</i>
<i> Soon as I'm done with work.</i>

13:03.049 --> 13:04.249
"Work", he calls it.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.217
<i> Heard that.</i>

13:06.353 --> 13:07.218
[Priscilla] Your father's
excited to see you too.

13:07.354 --> 13:08.520
[phone beeps]

13:08.655 --> 13:09.988
[quietly] Ooh.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.422
Mom, can I call you back?

13:11.558 --> 13:13.224
Uh, yeah. Come hungry.
[blows kiss]

13:13.927 --> 13:17.162
Henry. Hey. It's Gavin Chase,
Belinda's manager.

13:38.385 --> 13:39.684
Hello?

14:04.477 --> 14:05.543
What?

14:20.227 --> 14:22.527
[music continues]

14:26.099 --> 14:26.998
Hey, kid.

14:28.635 --> 14:30.301
Merry Christmas to you, too.

14:30.904 --> 14:31.836
Marilyn?

14:32.806 --> 14:34.439
You're-you're...

14:34.608 --> 14:35.607
You can do it.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.409
Four letters. Starts with D.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.044
Okay, this is not funny.
Who are you?

14:41.248 --> 14:44.482
The song in this music box
was playing the night we met,
remember?

14:45.018 --> 14:46.017
Not a great party.

14:46.152 --> 14:47.018
But the eggnog was great.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.421
Okay, this cannot be happening.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.490
They warned me you might
have a tough time with this.

14:52.626 --> 14:54.926
Georgia was right.
I'm-I'm not getting
enough sleep. She said...

14:55.061 --> 14:56.594
-Hey.
-The paint.

14:56.730 --> 14:58.029
The paint. I must have
inhaled the fumes and--

14:58.164 --> 14:59.964
Okay, stop, stop.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.399
This isn't a dream.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.034
So you're...

15:04.437 --> 15:05.236
You're real.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.605
-Mm-hm.
-What are you doing here?

15:10.110 --> 15:13.111
I'm here to keep you
from ending up like me.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.412
[laughs nervously]

15:14.547 --> 15:15.880
You're my idol.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.815
Why wouldn't I want
to be like you?

15:17.951 --> 15:20.652
Because when the time comes
to roll the credits
on your life,

15:20.754 --> 15:24.555
you'll remember that it's
the names that are important,
not the work.

15:24.658 --> 15:26.257
I don't understand.

15:26.393 --> 15:27.558
I didn't expect you to.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.027
That's where we come in.

15:29.663 --> 15:30.895
"We"?

15:31.064 --> 15:32.497
A tough nut needs
a tough nutcracker.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.767
So I've recruited
a few of my friends.

15:35.936 --> 15:38.803
[playing acoustic guitar]

15:42.609 --> 15:44.509
Well, hello, darlin'.

15:44.611 --> 15:48.146
Allow me to introduce to you
the Spirit of Christmas Past.

15:48.181 --> 15:50.682
Marilyn tells me
you've gone off the trail.

15:50.817 --> 15:54.452
I figure the best way
to find out why

15:54.587 --> 15:57.822
is to go see where you took
a wrong turn along the way.

15:57.958 --> 16:00.625
See? He has southern wisdom.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.060
I love that.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.430
This-this is really happening.

16:05.532 --> 16:06.931
Mm-hm.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.399
You were a friend to me
when I didn't have many,

16:08.535 --> 16:10.535
so this is my way
of saying thank you.

16:11.171 --> 16:12.303
There's so much I want to say.

16:12.339 --> 16:13.705
Save it.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.907
They used to do all
of this in one night.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.775
We have five.

16:17.811 --> 16:20.211
Though I still feel
like we're pushing it.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.113
Have fun, you two.

16:25.385 --> 16:26.384
Are you--

16:27.354 --> 16:28.486
Candy cane?

16:29.689 --> 16:31.956
I'm sorry, uh, Mister...

16:32.092 --> 16:34.292
Past, or what do I call you?

16:34.394 --> 16:39.998
Well, the full name
is "Spirit of Christmases
Which Have Come Before".

16:40.033 --> 16:41.466
Friends call me Pat.

16:41.601 --> 16:42.667
Pat.

16:43.870 --> 16:46.070
Perfect. Uh, hey,

16:46.139 --> 16:48.606
so I produce
a Christmas special,
Country Christmas Live.

16:48.775 --> 16:51.476
Maybe you've heard of it.
Anyway, we tape in less
than a week,

16:51.511 --> 16:54.779
so I would really appreciate it
if you could get me back
to the studio,

16:54.948 --> 16:56.180
because I don't...

16:56.549 --> 16:57.548
I, uh...

16:57.684 --> 16:59.350
Well, no can do, darlin'.

16:59.919 --> 17:03.354
See, you and I
are going on a tour...

17:03.490 --> 17:05.156
of your past.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.694
What is it you like to say?

-I mean, you're not here now.

You'll get it.

That's me.

Ten, going on 45.

That's the first camera
I ever got. I got it
for Christmas that year.

This must be...

18:14.360 --> 18:16.627
Gavin, the snowman needs a hat.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.029

Every snowman
has to have a hat.

Not that kind of hat.

can't be cowboys?

-Yes.

and Gavin's idea.

22:58.044 --> 23:00.444
I'm sorry, I've had
a long morning.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.812
Which-which idea was this?

23:01.981 --> 23:04.248
Adding a dog
to the opening number.

23:05.385 --> 23:07.318
Wow, he, uh,
he told you about that.

23:07.453 --> 23:09.387
He did. [laughs]
I think it's wonderful.

23:10.022 --> 23:11.856
That is... [exhales]

23:12.425 --> 23:14.792
That is great. Um, could you
just excuse me for one moment?

23:14.927 --> 23:16.093
Oh, yeah, sure.
Go right ahead.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.064
Gavin?

23:20.199 --> 23:22.032
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Outside?

23:22.201 --> 23:23.501
-Sure.
-Now.

23:26.205 --> 23:27.538
One second.

23:27.673 --> 23:29.473
Why didn't you wait
for my answer?

23:29.609 --> 23:31.108
Oh, you seemed open
to the idea of a dog.

23:31.244 --> 23:32.143
I said I'd look into it.

23:32.278 --> 23:33.611
I looked into it for you.

23:33.713 --> 23:35.646
Do you--you don't like dogs?

23:35.782 --> 23:37.615
I love dogs.
Everybody loves dogs.
That is not the point.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.183
What's the point?

23:39.285 --> 23:40.584
The point is you went
over my head to my boss.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.920
That is completely
inappropriate.

23:43.022 --> 23:45.923
Okay. You're right. Fine.
I did. But I did it for Belinda
and for the production, so..

23:46.092 --> 23:47.124
Sorry.

23:47.226 --> 23:48.826
Fine. Just...

23:49.996 --> 23:52.696
next time come to me
before Mr. Moss.

23:52.732 --> 23:54.265
-Fine. I will.
-Thank you.

23:54.801 --> 23:56.367
-About the dog--
-Oh, my gosh.

23:56.469 --> 23:58.469
You said it yourself.
Everyone loves dogs.

23:58.571 --> 24:00.638
Okay, no, I do not
have time to explain
this to you right now.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.606
Okay, I need to--I am late
to get to a meeting
for the wrap party.

24:02.742 --> 24:04.642
-Great. I'll go with you.
-Right.

24:04.744 --> 24:07.812
[Gavin] Country Christmas Live.
It's not actually live.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.413
So why couldn't you shoot
one version with the dog

24:09.549 --> 24:12.116
and one without and then
just... cut them together?

24:12.151 --> 24:14.051
Well, because it needs
to feel live to our audience.

24:14.153 --> 24:16.220
That was Marilyn's biggest rule.

24:16.255 --> 24:18.522
We need to pretend
like we are going into
people's living rooms.

24:18.658 --> 24:20.357
So what are we doing here?

24:20.460 --> 24:24.161
Well, this is where we are
having the crew wrap party.

24:24.297 --> 24:26.697
I'm supposed to be planning it,
but I'm way behind.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.366
This looks super familiar.
I think I've been here before.

24:30.369 --> 24:32.002
-You have.
-I have.

24:32.538 --> 24:34.171
Chet Walder's Christmas party.

24:36.943 --> 24:40.311
Okay. Um, look, I, uh...

24:41.714 --> 24:43.314
I owe you an apology.

24:43.449 --> 24:45.082
For sort of going over
your head to your boss.

24:45.218 --> 24:47.685
Oh, was that "sort of" going
over my head to my boss?

24:47.820 --> 24:50.588
[chuckles] [clicks tongue]
Fine. I was a jerk.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.823
So maybe we can make a deal.

24:52.925 --> 24:55.192
If you could find
a way to put a dog in
Belinda's opening number,

24:55.328 --> 24:57.361
I will put together your
entire crew party for you.

24:58.197 --> 25:00.464
What, you like, moonlight
as an event planner too?

25:00.600 --> 25:02.733
Absolutely.
Album release parties,

25:02.869 --> 25:04.502
charity balls,
birthday parties,

25:04.604 --> 25:07.071
and all without a single
noteworthy disaster, so...

25:07.173 --> 25:09.406
Look, let me-- let me
take this off your plate.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.943
Okay. I get to pick the dog.

25:13.079 --> 25:15.412
-See? We make a great team.
-[chuckles]

25:15.448 --> 25:16.747
[phone vibrating]

25:19.085 --> 25:21.519
[inhales] My parents.
I'm supposed to meet them
for dinner, so...

25:21.621 --> 25:23.187
Please, go. Go, go.

25:23.322 --> 25:25.756
I promise I will not retract
our great dog compromise.

25:25.892 --> 25:26.891
Sounds good.

25:29.161 --> 25:30.060
[sighs]

25:30.796 --> 25:32.429
I did want to ask...

25:32.565 --> 25:35.232
Why'd you give Belinda
the opening number?

25:35.368 --> 25:38.769
It's the biggest part
of the show. You weren't
very happy with me, so...

25:39.639 --> 25:40.871
why give her that opportunity?

25:43.309 --> 25:45.242
Because she is the best.

25:49.782 --> 25:50.814
See you.

25:53.953 --> 25:55.085
Oh, wait, Gavin!

25:55.254 --> 25:57.855
Wait! You forgot your scarf.

26:03.162 --> 26:04.261
[Gavin] Vivienne!

26:04.864 --> 26:05.863
Viv. Hey.

26:05.998 --> 26:06.864
Gavin?

26:06.999 --> 26:08.799
Vivienne, hey.

26:08.935 --> 26:10.401
Are--are you coming tonight?

26:10.536 --> 26:12.536
What kind of Nashvillian
would I be

26:12.672 --> 26:14.805
if I missed the Nashville
Christmas Festival, huh?

26:14.941 --> 26:16.273
Oh, my gosh.

26:16.409 --> 26:18.842
Love the hair.

26:18.978 --> 26:20.644
Anybody tell you it's rude

26:20.780 --> 26:22.913
making somebody time travel
without asking them first?

26:23.049 --> 26:26.150
Better to ask for forgiveness
than permission in this case.

26:26.285 --> 26:27.851
I--I could pick you up,
if you'd like.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.386
What, like a date?

26:30.156 --> 26:31.789
No, no, well--

26:31.924 --> 26:33.457
Oh, my gosh, I'm kidding.

26:33.593 --> 26:36.026
You're blushing so hard.

26:36.395 --> 26:38.262
I'm--I'm--

26:38.397 --> 26:40.030
My shoot might be going late,
so I'll just meet you there,
okay?

26:40.666 --> 26:41.799
Uh, yeah, no,
that sounds great.

26:41.901 --> 26:42.866
Okay.

26:43.002 --> 26:45.469
Gavin sure seems sweet on you.

26:46.572 --> 26:49.807
Gavin? No. No. We were
just really good friends.

26:49.976 --> 26:51.809
-Mm-hm.
-[indistinct conversation]

26:51.944 --> 26:54.511
Hey, don't lose that scarf.

26:54.547 --> 26:57.081
We got a lot more to see.

26:59.452 --> 27:02.319
["We Wish You a Merry Christmas"
playing]

27:04.290 --> 27:05.522
[gasps]

27:05.625 --> 27:08.425
-Santa.
-Shh.

27:11.897 --> 27:13.631
Mm.

27:13.733 --> 27:16.533
These are from Ms. Marjorie's
Cookie Company.

27:16.636 --> 27:18.202
Mm.

27:18.738 --> 27:20.804
Maybe I'll stick around.

27:20.940 --> 27:22.406
I'm sure the other kids
won't mind getting presents
on the 26th.

27:22.541 --> 27:24.508
[both laugh]

27:24.610 --> 27:26.777
Cut! That was perfect!

27:26.879 --> 27:28.445
Almost.

27:28.581 --> 27:30.714
That was a great laugh.
Energy, love it.

27:30.850 --> 27:33.117
I certainly had
plenty of confidence.

27:33.252 --> 27:36.487
Hey, even back then,
you knew what you wanted.

27:36.589 --> 27:38.956
You knew how to make it happen.

27:39.091 --> 27:40.491
...what you're doing. Um,
when he takes the bite of...
[continues indistinctly]

27:40.626 --> 27:43.193
Why me? Why now?

27:43.295 --> 27:45.629
Hey, if a needle
falls out of its groove,

27:45.765 --> 27:49.366
it just needs a little nudge
to get back into place.

27:49.502 --> 27:51.669
[Young Vivienne] Just keep your
cheeks rosy. Keep the energy up,
and let's go again.

27:51.804 --> 27:55.005
When you say things like that,
it makes way less sense
than you think.

27:56.275 --> 27:58.308
Sorry I can't pay up front.

27:58.444 --> 28:00.511
With all the new business,
I promise.

28:00.546 --> 28:02.613
Oh, no, Ms. Marjorie,
I already told you,

28:02.715 --> 28:04.481
do not even worry about it.

28:04.617 --> 28:07.084
Nashville needs you and I'm
happy to help any way I can.

28:07.219 --> 28:08.519
Boy, was I naive.

28:08.654 --> 28:10.454
I didn't even get paid.

28:10.589 --> 28:12.289
Well, not then.

28:12.358 --> 28:15.626
Your commercial did a real treat
for Ms. Marjorie's business.

28:15.761 --> 28:17.361
She made you whole.

28:17.463 --> 28:20.164
And you haven't paid for so much
as a macadamia nut since.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.066
Yeah, well, that's Ms. Marjorie.

28:22.168 --> 28:23.967
Ms. Marjorie
is not the real world.

28:24.103 --> 28:27.304
You know, I have a grandson
around your age.

28:27.440 --> 28:29.907
Would love for you two to meet.

28:30.009 --> 28:32.276
That is, if you're not
already spoken for.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.611
Oh, I, am...

28:34.747 --> 28:38.348
so flattered,
Ms. Marjorie, but...

28:38.484 --> 28:40.718
I think I do
already have someone.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.119
Ooh.

28:42.254 --> 28:43.854
And who might that have been?

28:45.057 --> 28:46.190
Don't know.

28:47.259 --> 28:48.192
This was a long time ago.

28:48.360 --> 28:49.560
Mm-hm.

28:50.362 --> 28:51.962
Sure.

28:52.798 --> 28:54.565
[whoosh]

28:54.700 --> 28:56.300
[Young Vivienne] Mm. Thanks
for the peppermint brittle.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.235
So tell me about the singer.

28:59.171 --> 29:00.104
Okay.

29:00.239 --> 29:02.005
Belinda Manners is her name.

29:02.141 --> 29:04.775
Super talented.
Uh, she's looking for a manager.

29:04.910 --> 29:06.610
We're actually meeting
on Monday,

29:06.746 --> 29:09.113
only for her to tell me
I'm not it.

29:09.215 --> 29:10.948
Why would she say that?

29:11.083 --> 29:12.616
I've never managed anybody.
[laughs]

29:12.752 --> 29:14.785
And I'm an assistant
at a talent agency.

29:14.887 --> 29:17.387
Okay, no. You just tell her
that you are the smartest,

29:17.490 --> 29:19.556
hardest-working, most loyal
person she'll ever meet,

29:19.592 --> 29:22.259
and she should be so lucky
to have you as her manager.

29:22.962 --> 29:24.194
Can--can you be my manager?

29:24.296 --> 29:26.363
[laughs] Do you want
to play this?

29:27.933 --> 29:29.333
Oh, you're going down.

29:29.468 --> 29:30.768
You're the one with the
pressure, okay?

29:30.903 --> 29:31.835
-All right.
-Thank you.

29:32.404 --> 29:33.437
There you go.

29:33.539 --> 29:34.805
I want the green.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.373
[chuckles]

29:36.475 --> 29:37.441
[sighs]

29:38.677 --> 29:40.577
-Okay. You ready?
-Okay.

29:40.746 --> 29:42.246
What makes matters worse
is I talked to my dad.

29:42.915 --> 29:45.048
He still thinks
this is a giant waste of time

29:45.184 --> 29:47.918
and I should quit
the music business
and join his construction firm.

29:48.854 --> 29:51.922
Mm-mm. You live your life,
not his.

29:52.024 --> 29:53.290
Nice shot.

29:53.893 --> 29:56.160
-Oh.
-I mean, if I can get just one,

29:56.262 --> 29:59.329
one successful artist,
he would not think
this is a waste of time.

30:00.866 --> 30:02.966
This is for the win.

30:06.105 --> 30:08.038
-Oh! [laughs]
-Boom!

30:08.174 --> 30:09.873
So, so loud.

30:09.942 --> 30:10.841
Oh.

30:11.477 --> 30:13.177
Thank you.

30:13.279 --> 30:15.445
There's so many people
I need to thank.

30:15.548 --> 30:16.947
What is this?

30:17.082 --> 30:18.749
[Young Gavin] Victory speech.

30:18.884 --> 30:20.684
[Young Vivienne] No, not that.
What is this compared to that?

30:20.820 --> 30:21.985
[Young Gavin] Second place.

30:22.087 --> 30:23.387
Watch what this does
for this jacket.

30:24.690 --> 30:26.590
Wow. You're so fancy.

30:26.725 --> 30:28.192
-Thank you.
-That's very chic.

30:28.327 --> 30:29.626
I need some peppermint brittle.

30:29.762 --> 30:31.261
And that's what happy
looks like.

30:33.566 --> 30:36.033
[Young Vivienne] That's a lot...
Okay, I can't--

30:36.135 --> 30:37.267
I can't concentrate anymore.

30:37.403 --> 30:38.402
-Does it look good?
-Yes.

30:38.571 --> 30:40.671
And I want to ask a question.

30:41.307 --> 30:43.073
-Okay, so...
-So...

30:43.209 --> 30:45.442
If Belinda Manners
does sign with you...

30:45.611 --> 30:47.244
Okay.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.913
You're going to need promotional
material for her, right?

30:50.049 --> 30:51.014
Right.

30:52.151 --> 30:54.451
Which would mean if she has
a music video,

30:54.587 --> 30:59.122
you will need someone
to direct your music videos,
correct?

30:59.158 --> 30:59.957
Mm-hm.

31:01.026 --> 31:05.262
Look, I know I don't have
a ton of experience,

31:05.397 --> 31:07.564
but you know
I would make it amazing.

31:07.666 --> 31:08.866
Vivienne.

31:09.001 --> 31:10.434
If I just had
the right opportunity.

31:10.536 --> 31:11.935
The job's yours.

31:12.605 --> 31:14.538
-Really?
-The job's yours.

31:15.241 --> 31:17.341
-I promise.
-Why?

31:19.845 --> 31:21.411
There's a lot of dreamers
out there.

31:22.748 --> 31:25.048
Most people can't make
those dreams become a reality.

31:27.686 --> 31:28.619
You can.

31:38.998 --> 31:42.399
Hey. Uh, hi. Excuse me.
Can you take our....

31:43.269 --> 31:46.503
...picture?
To remember this moment.

31:46.639 --> 31:47.771
Just push there.

31:47.907 --> 31:48.972
Is this going back on?

31:49.141 --> 31:50.574
-Your choice.
-All right.

31:51.210 --> 31:54.011
-Mm.
-I think it's a good look.

31:55.147 --> 31:56.847
There we go.

31:58.017 --> 32:00.484
[both chuckle]

32:02.922 --> 32:04.288
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

32:04.390 --> 32:06.456
-Okay, let's see.
-Let's see it.

32:08.928 --> 32:11.795
[both laugh]
[indistinct conversation]

32:11.897 --> 32:13.096
What?

32:14.667 --> 32:16.533
Just friends?

32:16.669 --> 32:18.602
We ate peppermint brittle and
played carnival games together.

32:18.737 --> 32:20.070
That is what friends do.

32:20.773 --> 32:23.040
I can see why Marilyn
asked for help.

32:23.175 --> 32:24.708
Hmm.

32:24.810 --> 32:26.743
You know, you are stubborn
as a mule.

32:28.147 --> 32:31.281
Um, excuse me.
I do not appreciate your tone.

32:32.451 --> 32:35.919
You get focused on something
and you just can't see
anything else.

32:36.822 --> 32:38.255
That... [scoffs]

32:38.390 --> 32:40.891
You didn't even notice
you dropped Gavin's scarf.

32:42.561 --> 32:44.561
-Shoot.
-It's all right.

32:44.596 --> 32:46.730
I grabbed it for you.

32:46.899 --> 32:48.999
Don't say I never
gave you anything.

32:50.402 --> 32:52.703
Hey, wait.

32:52.871 --> 32:55.105
Hey. Get back here!

32:55.240 --> 32:56.039
Viv.

32:56.875 --> 32:58.008
-Hey.
-Hey.

32:58.143 --> 33:00.410
Who, uh, who were
you talking to?

33:00.579 --> 33:02.679
Oh, no one. I was, uh,
[laughs nervously]

33:02.781 --> 33:04.681
trying to remember something,
you know?

33:04.717 --> 33:08.085
"Get back here in my brain,
you rascally memory."

33:11.323 --> 33:12.723
Okay. Um, I forgot my scarf,
so...

33:12.825 --> 33:14.691
Yeah, no, here.
Don't wanna forget that.

33:14.793 --> 33:15.726
Yeah.

33:16.295 --> 33:17.928
-You good?
-Yeah.

33:18.397 --> 33:20.297
-Okay. See you later.
-Bye.

33:22.368 --> 33:24.267
Careful.

33:24.403 --> 33:26.269
Gavin thinks you've
lost your marbles.

33:26.405 --> 33:27.971
You did that on purpose.

33:28.073 --> 33:29.840
Did what?

33:29.875 --> 33:31.475
You stopped at the good part,
when everything was fine.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.677
Show what happens next.

33:33.812 --> 33:35.112
That part's not as fun.

33:35.280 --> 33:36.413
Yeah, no kidding.

33:37.449 --> 33:38.782
It's your rodeo.

33:42.254 --> 33:43.387
[clears throat]

33:44.056 --> 33:48.025
["O Come All Ye Faithful" plays]

33:48.160 --> 33:50.694
[indistinct chatter]

33:50.863 --> 33:53.697
Gavin said this was a Christmas
part. There's a red carpet.

33:53.832 --> 33:54.998
Red's a Christmas color.

33:55.134 --> 33:57.534
Oh, g--
Everybody looks so shiny.

33:57.569 --> 33:59.069
It's like they're glazed,
Georgia.

33:59.204 --> 34:00.303
Glazed.

34:01.707 --> 34:04.975
Look, Mr. Big Shot throwing
the party wants to sign Belinda
to his label, right?

34:05.077 --> 34:07.411
Right.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.980
<i> So, if that happens,</i>
<i> you'll finally get to direct</i>
<i> that music video</i>

34:10.082 --> 34:12.482
you've been talking non-stop
about for the past year.

34:12.618 --> 34:14.418
Just try to relax, okay?

34:14.453 --> 34:17.220
I'm sure this'll be one
of the best nights of your life.

34:17.356 --> 34:19.022
I gotta go.
I love you, Georgia.

34:19.158 --> 34:21.124
<i> I love you too.</i>
<i> I won't wait up.</i>

34:21.260 --> 34:23.393
Who's got two thumbs and
is ready for shrimp cocktail?

34:23.529 --> 34:24.828
This guy.

34:24.930 --> 34:26.430
Oh, no. I'm really
underdressed, aren't I?

34:26.565 --> 34:27.998
No. You look great.

34:28.801 --> 34:29.699
-You ready?
-Yeah.

34:29.835 --> 34:30.700
Let's do it.

34:33.238 --> 34:34.838
[melancholy music]

34:34.973 --> 34:37.407
-You remember this night?
-Yup.

34:37.509 --> 34:40.544
That was without a doubt
the worst night of my life.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.313
[country music playing faintly]
[indistinct chatter]

34:43.449 --> 34:44.381
[Young Vivienne] Thank you.

34:44.483 --> 34:45.782
[Young Gavin] Thank you.

34:47.152 --> 34:48.485
Wow.

34:49.288 --> 34:51.555
-This is amazing.
-[laughs]

34:52.691 --> 34:53.824
Wow.

34:53.959 --> 34:55.592
-Oh, there he is.
-Who?

34:55.727 --> 34:57.427
-Chet.
-Who?

34:57.563 --> 34:59.296
Walder, the head
of Galaxy Records.

34:59.398 --> 35:00.831
Right. Yes.

35:00.866 --> 35:02.232
You're currently
at his Christmas party.

35:02.367 --> 35:04.434
Sorry, I forgot.
I'm nervous.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.837
How did you--what are you
nervous about? There's nothing
to be nervous about.

35:06.972 --> 35:08.538
If I may say,

35:08.574 --> 35:10.440
there's no one I'd rather
be here with than you.

35:10.542 --> 35:12.209
-Oh.
-Mm-hm.

35:12.344 --> 35:14.244
You know, it's a shame you
wasted your plus one on me.

35:14.379 --> 35:16.379
This kind of party could
really impress a girl.

35:16.515 --> 35:17.547
You're not impressed?

35:17.683 --> 35:19.616
Oh, I think he's coming over.

35:19.651 --> 35:20.951
-He's not coming over--
-I think...

35:21.086 --> 35:22.853
-Oh, no, he's coming over.
-Yeah.

35:22.988 --> 35:24.121
[Chet] You're Gavin Chase,
right?

35:24.156 --> 35:25.088
Chet Walder.

35:26.391 --> 35:28.391
Yeah, no, I know. Thanks.

35:28.527 --> 35:30.127
This is amazing.
Thanks for having us.

35:30.229 --> 35:31.895
Oh, this is a little hoot.
Yeah, it's nothing. Uh...

35:32.664 --> 35:34.364
Ugly Christmas sweater.
Hilarious.

35:34.500 --> 35:35.899
Oh, this isn't...

35:36.034 --> 35:37.434
[laughter]

35:37.569 --> 35:39.903
Your hands look cold.
Let me grab you a drink,

35:40.038 --> 35:41.404
so we can warm you up
a little bit.

35:41.540 --> 35:42.672
That's okay.
You don't have to right now.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.441
-It's--it's fine.
-Sure I do.

35:44.576 --> 35:47.344
You are the manager for Galaxy
Records' newest artist, right?

35:48.780 --> 35:50.247
[high-pitched] What?
[clears throat]

35:50.382 --> 35:51.548
-What?
-[laughs]

35:51.683 --> 35:52.516
Welcome to Chet's Galaxy.

35:52.651 --> 35:55.085
What? Oh, yes!

35:55.120 --> 35:56.820
Can you excuse me one second?
I have to tell her--

35:56.955 --> 35:58.522
-Go. Go, go, go, go.
-Just one second. One second.

36:03.195 --> 36:04.394
-You did it.
-Wait, what?

36:04.530 --> 36:06.463
-You did it.
-No.

36:06.565 --> 36:08.131
We did it.

36:10.269 --> 36:11.868
-It's a great party.
-Huh?

36:12.004 --> 36:13.336
The party, it's good.

36:13.472 --> 36:14.738
Oh, yeah, thanks.

36:15.607 --> 36:17.307
So I know that this
isn't really the time,

36:17.409 --> 36:19.676
but I've got some great ideas
for Belinda's first music video.

36:19.811 --> 36:21.411
I think you're really
gonna love them.

36:21.547 --> 36:24.881
Oh. Uh, you're Gavin's
little director friend.

36:26.318 --> 36:27.617
"Little director friend"?

36:27.753 --> 36:29.419
Yeah, so, uh,
we talked about it,

36:29.555 --> 36:32.889
and that's a no-go on you
directing the music video.

36:32.991 --> 36:35.859
It's, uh, it's gonna set the
tone for the whole rollout.
You understand.

36:35.994 --> 36:37.861
Gavin said he already
talked to Belinda.

36:37.930 --> 36:40.230
Yeah. Gavin's a smart guy.

36:40.332 --> 36:41.631
He'll know this is for the best.

36:46.405 --> 36:47.337
And now one with just Belinda.

36:47.506 --> 36:48.939
Yeah, yeah, of course.

36:53.212 --> 36:54.878
-What's up?
-Did you know about this?

36:55.013 --> 36:57.280
-About what?
-The music video.

36:57.316 --> 36:59.749
What about it?

36:59.885 --> 37:01.952
Well, Chet said that it's
too important to give to
your "little director friend".

37:02.621 --> 37:05.522
-Whoa, whoa.
-No--

37:05.691 --> 37:09.426
All I said was that
we should go with someone
with a little more experience.

37:09.461 --> 37:11.361
I expect you to back me up
on this, Gavin.

37:13.031 --> 37:14.631
He has a--he has a point.

37:14.766 --> 37:17.234
It's her first video,
and I mean,

37:17.369 --> 37:19.002
we could probably get her on,
you know, one down the road.

37:19.137 --> 37:21.137
-We'll talk about it.
-Yep. Yeah.

37:21.773 --> 37:23.573
I'll work on getting you a job
on the set of this one.

37:23.609 --> 37:25.675
Oh, you'd get me a job on the
set? You'd do that for me?

37:25.811 --> 37:27.277
Can you work with me here?

37:27.412 --> 37:28.912
You told me that everything
was gonna be--

37:29.047 --> 37:30.647
Vivienne, you know how
important this is to me, okay?

37:30.782 --> 37:32.616
You've gotten everything you
want, even since we were kids.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.718
So can you compromise this once?

37:34.853 --> 37:36.253
[gasps]

37:36.321 --> 37:38.688
I just believed you had my back.

37:40.525 --> 37:44.327
You know what?
You have fun in Chet's Galaxy.

37:44.463 --> 37:45.428
Vivienne.

37:45.564 --> 37:47.597
[melancholy music]

37:49.134 --> 37:50.267
Vivienne.

37:53.805 --> 37:58.008
[instrumental rendition
of "O Come All Ye Faithful]

37:58.110 --> 38:00.810
[indistinct chatter]

38:02.214 --> 38:03.847
Don't cry in the eggnog, kid.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.482
It's the best thing
about this party.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.117
I'm not--I'm not crying.

38:07.252 --> 38:08.652
Oh. My bad.

38:08.787 --> 38:09.886
Beats craft service.

38:10.589 --> 38:11.821
You work in production?

38:11.957 --> 38:13.323
Television.

38:13.425 --> 38:15.425
You ever see
Country Christmas Live?

38:15.560 --> 38:17.394
Uh, yeah.

38:17.529 --> 38:18.962
But what happened
last year, though?

38:19.097 --> 38:20.630
White Christmas and
Silent Night back to back?

38:20.766 --> 38:22.799
Were they trying
to put us to sleep?

38:22.901 --> 38:26.102
I wish we had. Maybe then
they wouldn't have
changed the channel.

38:26.238 --> 38:27.737
Who are you?

38:27.873 --> 38:29.139
Oh, I'm nobody.

38:29.174 --> 38:30.373
No, you're not.

38:30.542 --> 38:31.975
I don't talk to nobodies.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.710
I'm Vivienne Wake.

38:33.845 --> 38:34.911
You in TV?

38:35.047 --> 38:37.914
Sort of. I, um...

38:38.050 --> 38:40.383
I've directed a couple things.
Just real tiny.

38:40.519 --> 38:41.785
Anything I would have seen?

38:42.788 --> 38:47.090
Well, I did this
small commercial for
Ms. Marjorie's Cookie Company.

38:47.225 --> 38:48.425
Oh, with Santa.

38:48.527 --> 38:50.060
That was a good spot.

38:50.162 --> 38:51.861
-[chuckles]
-And you did that by yourself?

38:51.963 --> 38:52.829
Mm-hm.

38:52.864 --> 38:54.364
Marilyn Jinway.

38:56.068 --> 38:59.202
I'm s--
The Marilyn Jinway.

38:59.338 --> 39:00.437
[chuckles]

39:00.539 --> 39:02.472
Wow. You've won,
like, four Emmys.

39:02.607 --> 39:05.875
Five, but one was daytime, so
we'll call it four and a half.

39:05.977 --> 39:07.110
[gasps]

39:07.913 --> 39:09.512
You're also...

39:09.614 --> 39:12.015
Executive producer
of Country Christmas Live,

39:12.150 --> 39:13.983
which I believe you said
put you to sleep?

39:14.019 --> 39:16.686
I am so sorry. Honestly, I--
I watch your show every year.

39:16.822 --> 39:18.922
I study your show.

39:19.024 --> 39:21.057
Thanks, kid.
It's okay. You're right.
I should have split the songs.

39:21.893 --> 39:26.129
So what brings you to
Chet Walder's Christmas
party, Vivienne Wake?

39:26.264 --> 39:29.866
I came with a friend...
or so I thought.

39:31.370 --> 39:32.969
You know what? Come with me.

39:35.006 --> 39:36.539
Wow.

39:36.675 --> 39:38.575
So this is it, huh?

39:38.710 --> 39:42.078
This is where
Country Christmas Live
comes to life?

39:42.214 --> 39:43.947
That's the idea.

39:43.982 --> 39:45.682
We're part of people's lives.

39:46.518 --> 39:49.152
Not everybody understands
what's at stake with that.

39:49.254 --> 39:50.653
I do.

39:51.757 --> 39:54.657
Look, you can't let your
feelings get in the way
with business, kid.

39:54.793 --> 39:56.426
No one else will.

39:56.595 --> 39:58.661
I learned that the hard way.

39:58.764 --> 40:00.130
Sounds like you did, too.

40:00.232 --> 40:01.931
[phone rings]

40:02.033 --> 40:03.733
Sorry.

40:03.869 --> 40:05.268
Is that your friend?

40:06.338 --> 40:07.203
Yeah.

40:07.339 --> 40:08.471
Hmm.

40:08.607 --> 40:10.039
He's looking out for him.

40:10.142 --> 40:12.409
Maybe it's time you started
looking out for you.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.616
How would you like
to have a job?

40:20.986 --> 40:22.051
Working for you?

40:22.187 --> 40:23.520
No. Shoeing reindeer.

40:23.655 --> 40:26.089
-[laughs]
-Yes, working for me.

40:26.258 --> 40:27.857
[laughs] Um...

40:30.495 --> 40:35.031
Yeah! I would--I, uh...
Yes, please. I would love--
I would love a job.

40:41.339 --> 40:42.672
[whoosh]

40:47.012 --> 40:48.344
[Vivienne]
Gavin broke his promise.

40:48.480 --> 40:49.779
He didn't even try
to stand up for me.

40:49.881 --> 40:50.980
Doesn't that mean anything?

40:51.082 --> 40:52.081
That was years ago.

40:52.684 --> 40:55.118
Yet it feels like yesterday.

40:55.153 --> 40:56.786
[James] Mm-mm-mm.

40:56.922 --> 40:58.721
<i> I smell that peppermint</i>
<i> all the way from Tahiti.</i>

40:58.757 --> 41:00.857
We're doing our best.
No topping yours, Dad.

41:01.026 --> 41:03.126
<i> Look, you and Gavin</i>
<i> were best friends.</i>

41:03.261 --> 41:05.762
<i> You shouldn't let one</i>
<i> little mistake spoil that.</i>

41:05.897 --> 41:07.464
One mistake?

41:07.632 --> 41:09.566
After he broke his promise
of not letting me do the video,

41:09.601 --> 41:12.735
two weeks later,
he moved to L.A.
without a single goodbye.

41:12.871 --> 41:14.404
<i> Fine. Two mistakes.</i>

41:14.506 --> 41:16.706
And as he was stabbing me
in the back,

41:16.842 --> 41:19.275
he had the nerve to say
that I'm the one who always
has to get my way.

41:19.377 --> 41:20.276
Can you believe that?

41:20.412 --> 41:21.811
[comical music]

41:23.615 --> 41:24.948
What?

41:25.050 --> 41:27.183
You can be...
slow to compromise.

41:27.319 --> 41:28.751
Tsk. No, I'm not.

41:28.887 --> 41:30.954
Oh, really?

41:31.056 --> 41:32.422
So, you wouldn't care
if I put three quarters
of a cup of sugar

41:32.524 --> 41:34.224
in this batch
instead of two thirds?

41:34.326 --> 41:36.893
That's not what the directions
say, though, Geor...gia.

41:39.231 --> 41:40.930
Look at it this way.

41:41.066 --> 41:42.365
Are you the same person
you were ten years ago?

41:43.335 --> 41:44.334
Not even close.

41:44.469 --> 41:45.401
Of course not.

41:45.504 --> 41:47.103
Because people change.

41:47.239 --> 41:49.873
Give Gavin a chance to prove
that he's changed, too.

41:54.045 --> 41:55.044
I will try.

41:59.351 --> 42:01.551
[festive music playing]
[indistinct chatter]

42:07.058 --> 42:08.791
-Belinda?
-Yes?

42:11.596 --> 42:13.530
Alexis. What's going on?

42:13.665 --> 42:16.132
It's a real honor to perform
on the same show as you.

42:16.268 --> 42:18.101
You've been my hero
since I was a kid.

42:18.236 --> 42:19.369
You're very kind.

42:20.305 --> 42:22.372
I'm a little nervous.

42:22.474 --> 42:24.207
Petrified, actually.

42:25.243 --> 42:27.143
Any advice?

42:27.279 --> 42:30.179
Yeah. If you forget the lyrics,
just keep dancing.

42:40.892 --> 42:42.859
Come on. It's one night.

42:42.994 --> 42:45.261
There'll be mulled cider.

42:45.363 --> 42:47.931
When you are finishing
law school, you will be
so happy I worked so hard.

42:48.066 --> 42:51.834
Pretty please,
with whipped cream
and a sugarplum on top?

42:51.970 --> 42:53.136
Georgia, really, I--

42:53.271 --> 42:54.871
Consider it
my Christmas present?

42:55.006 --> 42:55.872
I've already gotten you
your Christmas present.

42:55.907 --> 42:57.807
Okay. Next year's, then.

42:57.943 --> 42:58.942
[laughs]

42:59.077 --> 43:02.312
[tender music]

43:04.382 --> 43:06.683
Okay, so Parker will
be taking care of the base
of the billboard.

43:06.851 --> 43:09.786
What do you feel
about snow in the foreground?

43:09.921 --> 43:12.322
Like, right next to the camera.

43:12.357 --> 43:15.024
[piano rendition of
"We Wish You a Merry Christmas"]

43:15.160 --> 43:17.627
You know, the last two days
I've been haunted
by my dead boss

43:17.796 --> 43:19.495
and the Spirit
of Christmas Past.

43:19.631 --> 43:21.097
Cool.

43:21.900 --> 43:24.767
Okay, you begged me to come out.

43:24.903 --> 43:26.970
Would have thought you'd
be a little bit more present.

43:27.105 --> 43:29.372
I'm sorry. You're right.

43:29.474 --> 43:31.140
Are you expecting somebody?

43:31.309 --> 43:33.910
What? [scoffs] No.

43:34.913 --> 43:36.813
Gavin. Hey.

43:38.850 --> 43:40.883
How's it going? I didn't know
both you guys would be here.

43:40.986 --> 43:43.052
Feeling's mutual.
How about you, Georgia?

43:43.188 --> 43:44.554
You expect to see Gavin?

43:45.256 --> 43:46.122
I don't know what
you're talking about.

43:46.224 --> 43:47.590
-No?
-Oh.

43:47.726 --> 43:49.826
Look at that.
I'm out of cider.

43:50.662 --> 43:52.061
I'll, uh...
I'll be right back.

43:56.334 --> 43:57.834
-Mind if I...
-Sure.

43:58.770 --> 44:00.336
It's good to see you.

44:00.438 --> 44:01.404
Glad to see you're getting
some time to relax.

44:01.539 --> 44:02.639
Mm.

44:02.774 --> 44:04.841
Believe me,
it is against my will.

44:04.943 --> 44:07.744
[chuckles] Georgia
was very insistent.

44:08.813 --> 44:10.013
Is that right?

44:11.282 --> 44:12.915
So, um, you guys were--

44:13.084 --> 44:17.253
Wow. Oh, wow.
I have so many messages
about tomorrow.

44:17.389 --> 44:19.589
I should-- I mean,
it's getting late.

44:19.758 --> 44:21.357
Can you tell Georgia that
I'll just meet her at home?

44:21.493 --> 44:23.526
-Sure.
-Okay. Have fun.

44:24.129 --> 44:26.462
Remember when we were kids,
around this time of year?

44:26.631 --> 44:28.498
What our conversations
were always about?

44:30.935 --> 44:32.835
We compared Christmas lists?

44:34.005 --> 44:35.905
That's right. Remember why?

44:37.208 --> 44:38.541
To make sure we wouldn't
have the same things.

44:39.477 --> 44:41.944
Yeah. So that we could borrow
whatever the other person
didn't get.

44:42.947 --> 44:44.480
We talked about music a lot.

44:44.582 --> 44:46.616
We did. I took you to
your first record store.

44:47.385 --> 44:49.485
And I introduced you
to Loretta Lynn.

44:50.321 --> 44:51.621
I got you her autograph.

44:51.756 --> 44:53.389
And I bought us tickets
to her show.

44:54.125 --> 44:55.425
You liked me more
than I liked you.

44:55.493 --> 44:57.927
Wow. Um, I'm sorry.

44:58.029 --> 45:02.031
I may have been the more
generous friend, obviously,
but you,

45:02.133 --> 45:05.902
you were the one
buying me peppermint brittle
at the Christmas Festival.

45:06.037 --> 45:07.070
You remember that.

45:07.205 --> 45:09.472
Yeah. Yeah. Uh...

45:09.607 --> 45:11.140
Things have been jogging
my memory lately.

45:12.544 --> 45:16.279
So did it jog your memory
about your second-place finish?

45:16.414 --> 45:20.683
It jogged my memory
about that obscenely
large snowman you got

45:20.819 --> 45:22.018
for a beanbag toss.

45:22.153 --> 45:23.453
You rigged that game.

45:23.588 --> 45:25.421
-I did not rig that.
-You rigged it.

45:25.557 --> 45:27.990
There is no way you could have
gotten such a huge snowman...

45:28.126 --> 45:29.425
-I was three for three.
-...compared to my tiny nose.

45:29.561 --> 45:34.530
It was huge.

45:34.632 --> 45:35.732
The cat hated me.

45:35.867 --> 45:37.533
You called her
"Emmylou Hairless".

45:37.669 --> 45:39.001
Oh, that was one of
my better ones. I did.

45:39.137 --> 45:40.303
[laughs]

45:42.373 --> 45:44.006
How's your dad doing,
by the way?

45:44.175 --> 45:45.775
He's been good.
He's in Tahiti right now.

45:46.778 --> 45:48.544
-I'm--I'm sorry, Tahiti?
-Yeah.

45:48.680 --> 45:52.048
We all spend Christmas together,
but since December's so busy,

45:52.150 --> 45:55.284
it's just easier for us to,
you know, send them on vacation.

45:55.386 --> 45:59.689
Wow. James Wake,
man of the high seas, huh?

45:59.791 --> 46:02.058
Yeah. Never good
at sitting still.

46:02.160 --> 46:03.593
Yeah. [chuckles]

46:04.763 --> 46:05.895
Kind of like you.

46:07.198 --> 46:08.097
What do you mean?

46:09.400 --> 46:10.733
You met Chet.

46:11.503 --> 46:13.002
And then...

46:13.138 --> 46:15.772
two weeks later,
you move to L.A. and...

46:15.907 --> 46:17.907
you're floating around
in Chet's Galaxy.

46:19.144 --> 46:20.710
I should have fought
harder for you.

46:20.845 --> 46:21.844
Look, I shouldn't
have brought this up.

46:21.980 --> 46:23.045
-No, I'm--
-I'm sorry.

46:23.148 --> 46:24.814
I'm glad you did. Vivienne.

46:24.916 --> 46:26.449
I think about that night a lot.

46:26.484 --> 46:28.551
[touching music]

46:28.653 --> 46:30.720
I didn't want to miss
that opportunity when
that door opened.

46:30.855 --> 46:33.589
-I was afraid if it--
-Hey, you--Gavin, Gavin.

46:33.691 --> 46:36.592
You did what you needed to do
for your career. It's fine.

46:36.728 --> 46:37.794
Okay?

46:38.797 --> 46:39.996
I get it.

46:41.466 --> 46:43.966
So listen,
crew has tomorrow off.

46:44.068 --> 46:46.102
I was wondering if you
might want to get together.

46:46.237 --> 46:48.771
Cultivate a little holiday
cheer? I don't know.

46:48.873 --> 46:50.940
[sighs]

46:51.042 --> 46:52.809
You know, I'm gonna have
to pass. I still have
so much to get done.

46:52.877 --> 46:54.277
[slow guitar music]

46:54.412 --> 46:57.480
-It's no problem.
-Uh, merry Christmas.

46:57.615 --> 46:59.148
Merry Christmas, darling.

47:00.585 --> 47:02.018
[chuckles]

47:02.153 --> 47:05.087
[continues playing]

47:05.190 --> 47:08.224
Hey, would you mind just
grabbing a cab real quick?

47:08.359 --> 47:09.992
I will be right back.
One minute.

47:16.601 --> 47:18.367
Fallen on hard times?

47:18.503 --> 47:21.737
You know, I'm more studied
on yesterdays than tomorrows.

47:22.907 --> 47:26.542
But why would you be skipping
out on a day with Gavin?

47:26.678 --> 47:28.544
You saw it.

47:28.713 --> 47:31.414
When push comes to shove,
Gavin chose his career
over our friendship.

47:32.050 --> 47:34.917
Nothing comes from mixing
the two but hurt feelings, so...

47:35.053 --> 47:36.619
Well, it's a funny thing.

47:36.788 --> 47:39.488
But you know, you'll hear
a song a thousand times,

47:39.524 --> 47:43.025
and then one day you
hear a whole different tune.

47:45.029 --> 47:48.764
[playing
"O Come All Ye Faithful"]

47:50.201 --> 47:52.935
[whoosh]
[indistinct chatter]

47:53.037 --> 47:55.338
-You did it. You did it.
-Wait, what? What?

47:55.440 --> 47:56.539
You're signed.

47:56.674 --> 47:58.074
-What?
-You have a record deal.

47:58.176 --> 48:01.077
-No way!
-This is gonna be huge for you.

48:01.246 --> 48:02.645
I can't do this without you.

48:02.780 --> 48:04.881
The good news is
you don't have to.

48:05.049 --> 48:06.682
-Gavin.
-Huh?

48:06.718 --> 48:08.284
I think tonight is the night.

48:08.987 --> 48:10.987
For what?

48:11.122 --> 48:13.522
You need to tell Vivienne
how you feel,
how you really feel.

48:15.126 --> 48:17.059
You're right. I'm going to.

48:18.129 --> 48:19.562
Belinda. Gavin.

48:19.597 --> 48:21.097
-Want to take a photo? Sure.
-sure.

48:21.199 --> 48:23.165
What does he mean,
"tell me how he feels"?

48:23.301 --> 48:24.600
Oh, I think you know.

48:31.442 --> 48:33.876
You know what? You have fun
in Chet's Galaxy.

48:33.912 --> 48:35.244
Vivienne.

48:35.813 --> 48:38.214
-Vivienne.
-Hey, wait, wait, wait.

48:38.349 --> 48:40.416
-Where are you going?
-Chet, Gavin, let's get you two.

48:40.985 --> 48:42.852
She's upset,
so I'm gonna go talk to her.

48:42.954 --> 48:43.920
Smile, G-Man.

48:44.055 --> 48:45.588
[shutter clicking]

48:45.623 --> 48:47.723
[Chet] You want my advice?
Let her go.

48:48.359 --> 48:49.926
You're at the top
of the mountain,

48:50.061 --> 48:51.160
and some of your old friends
may not like the air.

48:52.830 --> 48:53.963
Maybe consider
giving her a chance.

48:54.098 --> 48:55.731
She's super talented.

48:55.867 --> 48:58.267
Look. Maybe I didn't
make myself clear.

48:58.369 --> 49:00.202
I call the shots, okay? Hey.

49:00.738 --> 49:02.538
If you can't get on board
with that, then maybe...

49:02.674 --> 49:05.474
Belinda Manners isn't right
for Galaxy Records after all.

49:05.643 --> 49:07.710
[melancholy music]

49:07.812 --> 49:09.946
[Gavin] Okay, well,
I have to explain this to her.

49:10.048 --> 49:11.614
Knock yourself out.

49:15.720 --> 49:20.056
You know, Gavin
called and called,
but you never answered.

49:20.191 --> 49:22.458
When Chet offered him
a chance to leave,

49:22.493 --> 49:26.062
he had to consider if there
was as much keeping him
in Nashville as he thought.

49:28.166 --> 49:29.298
[whoosh]

49:29.434 --> 49:33.769
[slow guitar music]

49:33.938 --> 49:35.338
You hearing a different tune?

49:35.873 --> 49:37.506
He did stand up for me.

49:38.710 --> 49:40.343
Oh, God.

49:40.511 --> 49:42.111
I must look pretty stupid, huh?

49:42.246 --> 49:43.713
Not stupid.

49:45.049 --> 49:49.618
It's just humans got
more heart than sense.
[chuckles]

49:49.787 --> 49:52.254
Hey, that's why us spirits
love y'all so much

49:52.357 --> 49:53.756
[chuckles]

49:55.226 --> 49:56.025
I'll see you around?

49:57.028 --> 50:00.696
No. I'm afraid this marks
the end of our road, darling.

50:02.567 --> 50:03.499
Wow.

50:04.369 --> 50:08.204
I kind of want to,
like, hug you or something.

50:08.239 --> 50:09.238
Is that a thing?

50:09.974 --> 50:11.107
Hey.

50:14.045 --> 50:16.645
Thank you for everything.

50:16.781 --> 50:20.383
You're welcome.
And say hey to my friend.

50:21.152 --> 50:21.951
Your friend?

50:22.053 --> 50:23.819
Oh, yeah.

50:23.955 --> 50:26.655
You don't think I'm the only
spirit Marilyn asked for help?

50:26.758 --> 50:28.124
Oh, boy.

50:28.226 --> 50:29.492
Oh, yeah.

50:29.627 --> 50:30.793
[laughs]

50:31.829 --> 50:33.029
Merry Christmas, Pat.

50:33.865 --> 50:35.197
Merry Christmas, darling.

50:36.868 --> 50:40.302
[tender music]

50:41.339 --> 50:44.240
Well, I thought
you might have fallen
into another dimension.

50:45.343 --> 50:46.776
[laughs nervously]

50:46.878 --> 50:49.145
Hey, I think I will take
that day off tomorrow.

50:50.114 --> 50:51.647
-Really?
-Yeah.

50:51.749 --> 50:52.948
Why not?

50:53.084 --> 50:55.184
Let's create some holiday cheer.

50:55.286 --> 50:56.852
Let's.

50:56.988 --> 50:58.354
Have a good night.

51:04.996 --> 51:06.595
Must be a really good
guitar player.

51:09.834 --> 51:11.500
Okay, so I didn't make a plan

51:11.636 --> 51:13.369
because I thought we could
throw in some ideas,

51:13.471 --> 51:14.870
see what options we have,

51:15.006 --> 51:16.372
but maybe we can start
from over here,

51:16.507 --> 51:17.807
-work our way--what?
-Vivienne.

51:18.976 --> 51:20.876
Producer hat.

51:20.912 --> 51:22.945
Okay. [makes whooshing sound]

51:24.015 --> 51:26.615
-What...
-It's still going.

51:26.751 --> 51:28.384
Relax. Enjoy yourself.

51:28.519 --> 51:30.386
-Have some fun, okay?
-Okay. Okay.

51:30.488 --> 51:32.688
-No more work.
-No more. Okay.

51:33.224 --> 51:34.557
You do have a plan
though, right?

51:34.692 --> 51:36.492
-I do have a plan.
-Okay, good. Good.

51:37.261 --> 51:39.361
[Gavin] So I don't mean for this
to be a competition, but...

51:39.497 --> 51:41.363
No, we've got
that Blue Christmas segment,

51:41.532 --> 51:44.066
and I feel like a wreath
is a perfect idea.

51:44.202 --> 51:45.568
I'm sorry. You have
a Blue Christmas what?

51:45.703 --> 51:46.535
Segment.

51:46.671 --> 51:47.503
What?

51:48.473 --> 51:49.472
A Blue Christmas segment.

51:49.540 --> 51:51.040
And that would be for...

51:51.175 --> 51:52.441
-Work.
-Work. Hmm.

51:52.477 --> 51:54.110
Is this Vivienne's
day off today?

51:54.745 --> 51:57.012
I--I thought it was.
I could be wrong.

51:59.951 --> 52:01.584
-I got an idea.
-Okay.

52:01.719 --> 52:02.985
There's this Blue
Christmas segment--

52:03.087 --> 52:05.588
Yes. I say go with the flow.

52:05.756 --> 52:07.623
Blue, blue, blue, blue,
blue, blue, blue, blue.

52:09.093 --> 52:11.260
Oh, look at this guy.

52:11.429 --> 52:13.062
Look, all these guys
deserve some love,
but look, this is my favorite.

52:13.164 --> 52:14.697
-These handmade ones.
-Uh-huh.

52:14.832 --> 52:16.198
See where the chisel
made these grooves?

52:16.334 --> 52:17.766
These cuts right here?

52:17.869 --> 52:19.435
-Oh, yeah.
-I love that.

52:19.570 --> 52:21.570
Oh, your dad used to make
ones like this, right?

52:21.606 --> 52:25.474
Yeah. [clears throat]
He sure did, for me and my mom.

52:26.511 --> 52:27.409
What?

52:29.714 --> 52:31.547
It's amazing, I...

52:31.649 --> 52:33.282
[chuckles]

52:33.317 --> 52:35.151
I think he thinks I'm gonna
wake up one day and just...

52:35.286 --> 52:39.088
have the realization that
this entire music business

52:39.190 --> 52:41.290
is just a terrible idea.

52:41.325 --> 52:43.225
You know, I just--
I don't understand it.

52:43.394 --> 52:45.494
Have you ever told him
how that makes you feel?

52:45.596 --> 52:47.963
I wouldn't consider Dad
a listener.

52:48.099 --> 52:49.465
[both laugh]

52:50.868 --> 52:53.002
Whether he listens or not
is not up to you,

52:53.104 --> 52:56.238
but at least you'll know
you tried.

52:56.374 --> 52:59.175
-Right?
-I guess so.

52:59.210 --> 53:00.509
How big's your tree?

53:00.645 --> 53:02.211
I don't have one.

53:03.247 --> 53:04.747
-Excuse me?
-Yeah, no, I brought some home,

53:04.782 --> 53:06.315
but I keep finding spots
for them in the show.

53:06.450 --> 53:07.383
-I'll see myself out.
-What are--what are you--

53:07.485 --> 53:09.018
How do you not have a tree?

53:09.053 --> 53:10.553
I keep finding spots
for them in the show.

53:10.655 --> 53:12.922
Welcome, you two.

53:13.057 --> 53:14.924
We have some lovely his and her
ornaments right over there
in the corner.

53:15.059 --> 53:16.725
-Oh, we're not-- uh...
-Yeah...

53:16.861 --> 53:18.427
This one's catching my eye,
though.

53:18.462 --> 53:19.895
[woman]
Well, a man of taste, I see.

53:19.997 --> 53:21.263
That is a fine instrument.

53:21.399 --> 53:22.364
Is it in tune?

53:23.201 --> 53:24.533
[strumming]

53:24.669 --> 53:26.135
-It is not. I'll take it anyway.
-[laughs]

53:26.270 --> 53:28.304
-I'll take this.
-Thank you.

53:28.339 --> 53:30.773
[festive music]

53:30.908 --> 53:32.308
[Vivienne] Hey, Lisa.

53:35.313 --> 53:37.446
-Hi.
-Gavin Chase.

53:37.615 --> 53:39.114
-Lisa.
-[laughs]

53:39.183 --> 53:41.016
[laughs] It's so nice
to finally meet you.

53:41.152 --> 53:42.251
Wonderful to meet you as well.

53:43.020 --> 53:44.386
I'm sorry, "finally"?

53:44.488 --> 53:47.356
Oh, Gavin is more than
generous every year.

53:47.491 --> 53:49.825
-Stop.
-Really?

53:49.961 --> 53:52.494
I thought you moved
to L.A. and forgot about
little old Nashville.

53:52.597 --> 53:53.929
Ah, well, there's a lot
you don't know.

53:54.031 --> 53:55.831
The kids were just
practicing their caroling.

53:55.967 --> 53:56.966
You guys are carolers?

53:57.101 --> 53:58.567
[all] Yeah.

53:58.636 --> 54:00.936
You--you mind if we--
we hear a little bit?

54:01.105 --> 54:02.037
I mean, I'm in the music
business. There could be a
record deal in it for you.

54:02.139 --> 54:03.672
-sure.
-Okay.

54:05.076 --> 54:07.576
Fa-la-la-la-la,
oh, fa-la-la-la-la

54:07.678 --> 54:10.879
Oh, fa-la-la-la-la,
oh, fa-la-la-la-la

54:11.015 --> 54:13.949
Deck the halls
with boughs of holly

54:13.985 --> 54:17.086
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

54:17.221 --> 54:20.289
'Tis the season to be jolly

54:20.424 --> 54:23.125
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

54:23.227 --> 54:24.493
Don we now our gay apparel

54:24.528 --> 54:26.428
I want to say thank you again.

54:26.530 --> 54:28.864
I mean, you make a lot of kids'
Christmases really special.

54:29.000 --> 54:32.601
Well, I get plenty of help,
from people like Vivienne,
for example.

54:32.637 --> 54:33.769
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

54:33.904 --> 54:36.005
-Really?
-Mm-hm.

54:36.140 --> 54:38.774
'Tis the season to be jolly

54:38.909 --> 54:40.442
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

54:40.578 --> 54:42.444
Apparently, she had some
tough Christmases growing up.

54:42.546 --> 54:44.146
She sure did.

54:44.282 --> 54:45.948
She's a special person.

54:46.984 --> 54:48.817
Yeah, she is.

54:48.953 --> 54:50.986
Toll the ancient
Yuletide carol

54:51.088 --> 54:54.523
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

54:57.561 --> 55:00.195
So what was the final verdict
on Vivienne's day off?

55:00.298 --> 55:02.097
[laughs] It was nice.

55:02.199 --> 55:04.566
Yeah, you know,
in a couple years,
I might even try it again.

55:07.705 --> 55:09.938
Hey, you know,
I was thinking, um...

55:10.074 --> 55:13.475
Growing up, you heard me
complain about my dad a lot.

55:13.511 --> 55:15.144
I never heard you complain once.

55:15.946 --> 55:19.181
And it couldn't have been easy
with it being just
your dad and your sister.

55:20.685 --> 55:23.752
One year I did burn the
peppermint brittle,
so that was pretty tough.

55:23.888 --> 55:26.689
[mock sigh] That's tough.

55:26.824 --> 55:27.956
It was.

55:28.359 --> 55:30.059
All right. See you tomorrow?

55:30.194 --> 55:31.293
Yeah. Bright and early.

55:31.395 --> 55:32.695
All right.

55:34.899 --> 55:35.698
Gavin?

55:35.833 --> 55:37.299
[tender music]

55:39.303 --> 55:42.738
It was hard sometimes, but...

55:42.907 --> 55:45.441
I always knew I'd be okay
because of the people
I care about.

55:58.756 --> 56:01.457
[mysterious music]

56:01.492 --> 56:03.759
There you are, sugar.
Have fun?

56:05.363 --> 56:09.498
Who are you, and...
what are you doing in my house?

56:09.633 --> 56:13.068
Oh, that doggone Pat.
He said he told you about me.

56:14.505 --> 56:15.738
Pat. Wait, you're...

56:15.840 --> 56:18.273
The Spirit of Christmas Present.

56:20.144 --> 56:21.777
Why? Were you expecting
somebody else?

56:22.947 --> 56:26.115
The Spirit of Christmas Present.
[chuckles]

56:26.217 --> 56:28.650
What does that mean, exactly?

56:28.786 --> 56:31.353
Well, Pat covers the stuff
that already happened.

56:31.489 --> 56:34.723
I cover the stuff happening now.

56:34.825 --> 56:38.794
Oh, dear. Did you think present
meant, like--like a gift?

56:38.929 --> 56:41.597
[chuckles] That happens
all the time.

56:41.732 --> 56:44.366
No, no, no, no.
I was just wondering.

56:44.502 --> 56:47.569
Well, isn't here
the present, so...

56:48.372 --> 56:51.407
Don't really need a spirit
to get me here. [chuckles]

56:51.509 --> 56:53.409
That is a good point, sugar.

56:53.444 --> 56:57.079
What could you possibly
need little old me for?

56:58.716 --> 56:59.548
Catch.

56:59.950 --> 57:00.983
[gasps]

57:06.123 --> 57:07.189
[Vivienne] Huh.

57:07.324 --> 57:09.158
Georgia says I work too much.

57:09.293 --> 57:10.759
Look who's here
on her day off.

57:10.795 --> 57:13.061
I don't think she's working...

57:15.332 --> 57:19.001
[soft music]

57:23.574 --> 57:26.041
No. Parker and Georgia?

57:26.177 --> 57:27.743
How long has this been going on?

57:27.845 --> 57:30.512
Don't ask me. I'm just
the Spirit of Christmas Present,

57:30.548 --> 57:33.615
not the Spirit of the Last
Six and a Half Months.

57:33.751 --> 57:36.251
Six and a half months?!

57:36.387 --> 57:39.421
Excuse me!
Excuse me, young lady.

57:39.523 --> 57:41.323
-Hello?
-She can't hear you.

57:41.392 --> 57:43.058
Same rules apply.

57:43.194 --> 57:45.027
Okay, a secret romance
on my set, that is bad enough,

57:45.196 --> 57:46.562
but my own sister?

57:46.664 --> 57:48.530
Can you blame her
for not saying anything?

57:48.666 --> 57:51.533
Yes! Yes, I absolutely
can blame her.

57:51.669 --> 57:54.403
She probably thought you'd
react... well, like this.

57:55.739 --> 57:57.039
[sighs]

57:57.942 --> 57:59.741
She's my sister.

58:01.579 --> 58:04.179
She can tell me anything.

58:04.915 --> 58:06.415
She knows that.

58:06.550 --> 58:08.617
-Hey, Vivienne.
-Huh?

58:08.652 --> 58:09.685
Catch.

58:09.820 --> 58:11.119
-[gasps]
-[whoosh]

58:13.023 --> 58:14.223
[sighs]

58:16.660 --> 58:18.560
Cheap trick.

58:25.402 --> 58:27.169
[chuckles]

58:27.304 --> 58:31.640
[festive music playing]

58:31.742 --> 58:34.109
[Vivienne] Oh,
I missed doing this.

58:34.245 --> 58:36.445
You had time to get a tree
and go on a date?

58:37.748 --> 58:39.915
Um, yeah.

58:40.017 --> 58:41.817
But it wasn't a date.

58:41.952 --> 58:44.987
Sorry, casual day reconnecting
with your childhood sweetheart.

58:45.155 --> 58:46.288
Old friend.

58:46.423 --> 58:48.023
You couldn't let me
have any fun?

58:50.361 --> 58:53.662
-He's not like I remember.
-Really? How so?

58:53.797 --> 58:55.664
He's more mature.

58:55.699 --> 58:56.999
Selfless.

58:57.635 --> 58:58.834
Okay.

58:59.003 --> 59:00.536
-More handsome.
-[gasps]

59:00.638 --> 59:03.205
-I knew it.
-Nothing has changed, though.

59:03.340 --> 59:05.774
You cannot mix personal
feelings with work.

59:05.910 --> 59:07.276
It is the first thing
that Marilyn taught me

59:07.411 --> 59:09.645
and it has served me well.

59:09.780 --> 59:11.980
I'm your sister
and I work for you.

59:12.116 --> 59:14.149
Isn't that mixing
personal feelings and work?

59:14.251 --> 59:15.617
Not the same thing.

59:15.719 --> 59:17.219
Why? Because you boss me
around anyways?

59:17.321 --> 59:19.021
Mm-hm. [chuckles]

59:22.126 --> 59:24.860
What about you?
What, uh...

59:24.962 --> 59:26.562
What did you do
on your day off?

59:26.630 --> 59:27.563
[soft music]

59:27.698 --> 59:30.265
Me? Uh, nothing much.

59:30.401 --> 59:32.200
Nothing you want
to tell me about?

59:33.971 --> 59:35.003
Um...

59:36.574 --> 59:38.240
-There was something.
-Yeah?

59:40.177 --> 59:41.510
I don't want to go
to law school.

59:42.813 --> 59:44.646
-What?
-I love working for you.

59:44.682 --> 59:46.949
-No, Georgia...
-I could come on full time.

59:47.084 --> 59:49.351
This business,
it's unreliable. No.

59:49.453 --> 59:52.454
-You manage.
-Manage. Exactly.

59:52.590 --> 59:55.757
I mean, all Dad and I have ever
wanted for you is stability.

59:55.893 --> 59:57.192
If this is because of Parker--

59:57.328 --> 59:58.627
Wait, you know about Parker?

59:58.762 --> 1:00:00.562
Y-yeah, of course.

1:00:00.698 --> 1:00:02.364
Of course I know about Parker.

1:00:02.499 --> 1:00:04.032
I mean, do you think that
there's anything on my set

1:00:04.201 --> 1:00:05.133
that I don't know about?

1:00:06.103 --> 1:00:07.102
I was going to tell you.

1:00:07.237 --> 1:00:08.537
Why didn't you?

1:00:09.239 --> 1:00:10.606
I was afraid you'd get mad.

1:00:12.910 --> 1:00:15.177
He means a lot to me.

1:00:16.981 --> 1:00:18.280
Hey.

1:00:20.017 --> 1:00:20.916
First of all,

1:00:21.652 --> 1:00:24.252
you can always tell me anything.

1:00:25.522 --> 1:00:26.722
You're my sister, okay?

1:00:28.058 --> 1:00:30.392
And second, if...

1:00:30.494 --> 1:00:32.260
[sighs]

1:00:32.396 --> 1:00:34.262
If Parker makes you happy,
then that's all that matters.

1:00:35.332 --> 1:00:36.264
Really?

1:00:38.168 --> 1:00:39.368
Really.

1:00:40.471 --> 1:00:42.104
Just...

1:00:42.272 --> 1:00:44.339
promise me you'll keep
thinking about law school.

1:00:45.576 --> 1:00:48.076
Okay. I will.

1:00:48.112 --> 1:00:49.311
Thank you.

1:00:58.722 --> 1:01:00.055
Oh, it's on.

1:01:00.157 --> 1:01:01.923
Oh, I see you--a handful?!

1:01:02.059 --> 1:01:03.392
Handful? No, no!

1:01:03.527 --> 1:01:04.359
[both] No, no, no!

1:01:10.067 --> 1:01:11.299
Oh! Is this our guy?

1:01:11.435 --> 1:01:12.934
This the doggy thespian?
Hey, buddy.

1:01:13.070 --> 1:01:14.870
-This is him.
-How are you? How's it going?

1:01:14.905 --> 1:01:16.371
How was rehearsal?

1:01:16.507 --> 1:01:18.740
Rehearsal was great.
It needs a big...

1:01:18.876 --> 1:01:20.442
I don't know, cymbal crash
when Santa comes in.

1:01:20.577 --> 1:01:21.977
I don't know.
What do you think?

1:01:22.079 --> 1:01:24.146
Oh, yeah. Um...
I'll tell the composer.

1:01:24.181 --> 1:01:26.281
Uh, well, I definitely wanted
to get your opinion on it.

1:01:26.450 --> 1:01:28.717
Go right ahead.
I trust your judgment.

1:01:31.321 --> 1:01:32.654
Look who we have.

1:01:32.756 --> 1:01:35.190
This is our star
of the opening act.

1:01:35.325 --> 1:01:36.658
[indistinct conversation]

1:01:54.945 --> 1:01:56.244
Vivienne.

1:01:56.380 --> 1:01:58.180
Uh, Henry. Hi.

1:01:58.882 --> 1:02:00.182
I've just about seen enough.

1:02:01.251 --> 1:02:04.619
Oh, Henry, if things
have been weird, I...

1:02:04.722 --> 1:02:07.956
Enough to know that we need you
in charge of the IMAs.

1:02:08.092 --> 1:02:09.424
[gasps] What?

1:02:11.462 --> 1:02:13.962
I--I don't know what to say.

1:02:14.131 --> 1:02:16.231
Um, thank you. Thank you.

1:02:17.801 --> 1:02:18.800
Uh, just one thing.

1:02:18.936 --> 1:02:21.002
Hm. Anything. Of course.

1:02:21.105 --> 1:02:23.839
Swap Belinda Manners
with Alexis Rinehart
for the opening number.

1:02:23.974 --> 1:02:25.373
What?

1:02:25.476 --> 1:02:26.842
Belinda's the past.
Alexis' the future.

1:02:26.944 --> 1:02:28.410
Board feels we should
reflect that.

1:02:28.545 --> 1:02:30.445
But you've seen Belinda
rehearse. She's terrific.

1:02:30.581 --> 1:02:33.048
And she'll be equally terrific
in a different spot.

1:02:33.851 --> 1:02:35.450
The show's tomorrow, Henry.
I don't think
that there's enough time--

1:02:35.552 --> 1:02:36.752
You're resourceful.

1:02:36.854 --> 1:02:38.887
I'm sure you'll manage.

1:02:39.022 --> 1:02:41.289
Belinda and Gavin,
they'll--they'll just--
they'll be devastated.

1:02:41.391 --> 1:02:44.593
Vivienne, you'll have a lot
of difficult conversations
working for the IMAs

1:02:44.728 --> 1:02:46.328
Now, if you can't handle this,

1:02:46.497 --> 1:02:48.630
maybe you weren't the producer
I thought you were.

1:02:55.038 --> 1:02:56.638
[country

1:02:56.774 --> 1:02:57.773
[knock at door]

1:02:57.908 --> 1:03:00.408
Uh, just a second!

1:03:04.148 --> 1:03:06.381
Now, I know you invited me
over to talk work,

1:03:06.483 --> 1:03:08.517
but there's a nasty rumor
going around that you have
a tree that needs decorating.

1:03:08.585 --> 1:03:09.785
Gavin, it's really important--

1:03:09.953 --> 1:03:12.087
Oh, no, no. Tree first.
Then work.

1:03:12.222 --> 1:03:13.488
Excuse me.

1:03:20.297 --> 1:03:21.496
I cannot wait for you
to see the crew party.

1:03:21.632 --> 1:03:23.198
Oh, I usually dread those.

1:03:23.233 --> 1:03:25.033
I mean, they're always
the night before we film,

1:03:25.135 --> 1:03:29.004
so I spend the entire party
stressed to the max, but...

1:03:29.106 --> 1:03:31.339
this year I'm a little...

1:03:31.475 --> 1:03:32.808
a little excited.

1:03:33.777 --> 1:03:35.010
What changed?

1:03:36.413 --> 1:03:38.013
I've been shown
a new perspective.

1:03:38.849 --> 1:03:40.081
-Is that right?
-Mm-hm.

1:03:41.185 --> 1:03:43.985
All right. Your house.
You ready?

1:03:44.121 --> 1:03:45.887
Ready.

1:03:45.989 --> 1:03:47.255
...to admit you're happy
I brought the decorations over?

1:03:47.357 --> 1:03:49.024
I can't--I can't--no.

1:03:49.660 --> 1:03:50.992
-Admit it.
-[laughs]

1:03:51.128 --> 1:03:53.094
I cannot admit that...

1:03:53.230 --> 1:03:56.665
until I see the star
on the tree.

1:03:56.800 --> 1:03:57.899
Mm-hm.

1:04:01.638 --> 1:04:02.671
Very lovely.

1:04:06.677 --> 1:04:08.343
Beautiful.

1:04:10.581 --> 1:04:11.580
Um...

1:04:12.983 --> 1:04:14.316
-Gavin, I invited--
-Real quick.

1:04:14.484 --> 1:04:16.418
These last couple days,

1:04:16.520 --> 1:04:18.987
I mean, I don't know how or why
or what's going on between us,

1:04:19.156 --> 1:04:20.655
but...

1:04:20.791 --> 1:04:22.090
for me it feels like...

1:04:22.226 --> 1:04:23.658
like it did back
when we were kids.

1:04:23.694 --> 1:04:25.527
You know? And I honestly
didn't know how much I...

1:04:25.662 --> 1:04:27.963
We're replacing Belinda with
Alexis for the opening number.

1:04:29.032 --> 1:04:30.699
Huh?

1:04:30.834 --> 1:04:32.434
She still has her spot
at the top of the second hour.

1:04:32.536 --> 1:04:35.403
-It's still a great spot.

1:04:35.539 --> 1:04:37.172

1:04:39.877 --> 1:04:41.076
Ouch. Um...

1:04:42.212 --> 1:04:43.545
Is this Henry's call?

1:04:45.816 --> 1:04:47.249
Belinda, you know, she...

1:04:49.186 --> 1:04:50.652
She had faith in me
from the very beginning.

1:04:52.456 --> 1:04:53.989
You mind if I be the one
to tell her?

1:04:55.659 --> 1:04:56.691
Yeah, of course.

1:04:59.897 --> 1:05:01.029
You know...

1:05:02.099 --> 1:05:04.799
she's not the only one
who had faith in you
from the beginning.

1:05:14.845 --> 1:05:15.844
[Gavin] Pop.

1:05:15.979 --> 1:05:16.978
Heading to the crew party.

1:05:17.681 --> 1:05:19.214
Hey, could you help me
with something real quick?

1:05:19.249 --> 1:05:20.482
Sure.

1:05:21.685 --> 1:05:23.585
I'm almost done
with this manger and...

1:05:23.620 --> 1:05:26.454
-Oh, it looks great.
-I can't get a grip on this guy.

1:05:26.556 --> 1:05:28.423
I need to make one last etching.

1:05:28.558 --> 1:05:30.392
-Okay. Here.
-There you go.

1:05:30.427 --> 1:05:32.027
-Sure. Right here?
-It's these calluses.

1:05:32.162 --> 1:05:33.628
-That'd be perfect.
-Yeah.

1:05:33.764 --> 1:05:35.096
I can't get a grip.

1:05:36.099 --> 1:05:37.899
I don't guess
you have that problem.

1:05:39.836 --> 1:05:40.969
[chuckles]

1:05:42.039 --> 1:05:42.837
I love you, Pop.

1:05:44.474 --> 1:05:45.407
I love you, too, son.

1:05:45.509 --> 1:05:47.776
[tender music]

1:05:47.844 --> 1:05:50.712
In fact, I love you so much
I'm gonna just say this
as plainly as I can.

1:05:50.847 --> 1:05:53.448
My entire life I've just
wanted to make you proud of me.

1:05:53.583 --> 1:05:57.018
I know this is not the line
of work that you would
have chosen for me, but...

1:05:57.154 --> 1:05:58.620
-[sighs]
-That's just it.

1:05:58.755 --> 1:06:00.355
You don't get to choose.

1:06:01.258 --> 1:06:03.124
It's not your choice.
It's my choice. It's my life.

1:06:04.728 --> 1:06:07.395
And I just wish
you could accept that.

1:06:07.531 --> 1:06:09.631
And if you can't...

1:06:11.268 --> 1:06:13.201
I can accept that, too.

1:06:16.807 --> 1:06:18.373
See you after the party.

1:06:26.016 --> 1:06:27.349

1:06:27.484 --> 1:06:29.117
[Georgia] Gavin did
a bang-up job, huh?

1:06:29.252 --> 1:06:32.654
I mean, I almost hate to
admit it, but this looks great.

1:06:32.823 --> 1:06:34.823
Speaking of...

1:06:40.497 --> 1:06:41.863
Hey.

1:06:41.898 --> 1:06:43.031
Hey.

1:06:43.166 --> 1:06:46.568
This looks amazing.

1:06:46.737 --> 1:06:48.503
Thank you.

1:06:48.538 --> 1:06:50.238
Um, you look amazing.

1:06:50.374 --> 1:06:52.073
Thank you.

1:06:52.175 --> 1:06:54.075
Oh, I was gonna tell you.
I, uh...

1:06:54.211 --> 1:06:56.244
-I finally talked to my dad.
-Oh, wow.

1:06:56.380 --> 1:06:57.645
-Yeah.
-How did that go?

1:06:57.781 --> 1:06:58.913
[sighs]

1:06:59.049 --> 1:07:00.715
So he's not the best listener.

1:07:00.751 --> 1:07:02.317
You were right.

1:07:02.452 --> 1:07:04.252
At least it felt good
to get it off my chest.

1:07:06.556 --> 1:07:08.656
You know, there is something
I brought to show you,

1:07:08.792 --> 1:07:11.059
but I forgot it in the studio,
so I'll be right back.

1:07:11.228 --> 1:07:12.761
I'll be here.

1:07:31.815 --> 1:07:32.947
Belinda?

1:07:35.419 --> 1:07:37.419
I didn't know anybody
was here. I'm just...

1:07:37.554 --> 1:07:39.154
clearing my head for tomorrow.

1:07:39.289 --> 1:07:42.057
Oh, yeah, no. It's okay.

1:07:42.192 --> 1:07:44.025
Look, I just want to apologize.

1:07:44.628 --> 1:07:45.660
Apologize?

1:07:45.796 --> 1:07:47.328
Yeah.

1:07:47.464 --> 1:07:49.164
You know, for...

1:07:49.266 --> 1:07:52.901
having to replace you with
Alexis for the opener. I...

1:07:53.003 --> 1:07:54.402
I know you would have
been incredible.

1:07:58.208 --> 1:07:59.441
I'm sorry.

1:08:01.378 --> 1:08:02.710
Excuse me.

1:08:16.426 --> 1:08:17.425

-Having fun?
-Yeah.

Oh, have you seen Belinda?

1:08:20.464 --> 1:08:21.162
Yeah, she's back in the studio.

1:08:21.298 --> 1:08:22.831
Oh, good.

1:08:22.866 --> 1:08:24.132
She must not have taken
the news very well, did she?

1:08:24.267 --> 1:08:25.567
What news?

1:08:25.702 --> 1:08:27.035
Well, you know,
about the opener change.

I tried to apologize, but...

1:08:28.772 --> 1:08:31.039
Vivienne, I haven't--
I haven't told her.

1:08:31.174 --> 1:08:32.540
I didn't know that you didn't
tell her. I didn't know
that you didn't tell her yet.

1:08:32.676 --> 1:08:34.375
Oh, Vivienne.
I gotta go talk to her.

1:08:34.511 --> 1:08:36.311
No, Gavin, I'm so sorry--

1:08:36.379 --> 1:08:38.880
Vivienne, this is not
just a client.
This is a dear friend, so...

1:08:40.117 --> 1:08:41.716
I--I gotta go talk to her.
I'm sorry.

1:08:41.751 --> 1:08:42.884
-Vivienne.
-Huh>

1:08:43.019 --> 1:08:44.719
We have to find her

1:08:44.855 --> 1:08:46.621
Yeah, no, don't worry.
Gavin's looking
for Belinda, so...

1:08:46.756 --> 1:08:48.289
Belinda?
Belinda's missing, too?

1:08:48.425 --> 1:08:49.991
What do you mean, "missing too"?

1:08:50.093 --> 1:08:51.459
[Georgia] No one's seen
Alexis since last night.

1:08:51.561 --> 1:08:52.594
The hotel said
she's not in her room.

1:08:52.762 --> 1:08:54.095
-What?
-Whoa.

1:08:54.898 --> 1:08:56.798
Did I just hear
what I thought I heard?

1:08:56.900 --> 1:08:58.666
'Cause surely the star
of our Christmas special
wouldn't be missing

-No.

I promise you we have
everything under control.

1:09:01.872 --> 1:09:03.505
I certainly hope so, Vivienne.

1:09:03.640 --> 1:09:04.672
Mm-hm.

1:09:07.410 --> 1:09:08.910
Okay, think, think, think,
think, think, think, think.

1:09:09.045 --> 1:09:10.512
Okay, um...

1:09:10.547 --> 1:09:11.880
I'll go to the airport.

1:09:12.048 --> 1:09:13.681
Maybe because of the snow
she's stuck there.

1:09:13.717 --> 1:09:15.483
What will you do
if you find her?

1:09:15.619 --> 1:09:17.252
I will strap her
to the top of the van
like a Christmas tree.

1:09:17.988 --> 1:09:20.321
I'm kidding. Mostly.

1:09:27.397 --> 1:09:29.898
Sorry. I'm in a huge hurry.
I'll come back later, though.

1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:32.700
Shoot. Um, okay.
Just real quick.

1:09:32.836 --> 1:09:33.902

1:09:36.973 --> 1:09:39.040
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Not now. Not now.

1:09:39.075 --> 1:09:40.508
Oh, now you're starting
to hurt my feelings.

1:09:40.644 --> 1:09:42.710
No, look.
My starlets are missing,

1:09:42.879 --> 1:09:44.812
I'm about to get fired
from my dream job before
I've even been hired,

1:09:44.915 --> 1:09:46.948
and I've upset someone
who means so much to me.

1:09:47.083 --> 1:09:48.449
I do not have time
for this right now.

1:09:48.585 --> 1:09:51.152
I'm sorry, sugar,
but the past stays put.

1:09:51.188 --> 1:09:53.655
The present is always changing.

1:09:53.790 --> 1:09:55.056
It's now or never.

1:09:55.158 --> 1:09:56.824
Well, great. I choose never.

keep falling for this?

1:10:09.139 --> 1:10:12.907
Don't beat yourself up.
I've had a lot of practice.

1:10:13.043 --> 1:10:15.476
[festive music playing]

1:10:17.214 --> 1:10:19.614
Okay, I put work
ahead of everything.

1:10:19.716 --> 1:10:20.882
Mm-hm.

1:10:21.017 --> 1:10:22.350
I push away the people
who matter most,

1:10:22.485 --> 1:10:25.453
and I'm a lousy person.
I get it, so just...

1:10:25.589 --> 1:10:27.021
take me back, okay?

1:10:27.157 --> 1:10:28.790
That's big of you, sugar.

1:10:28.892 --> 1:10:32.360
But the past is only part
of your story. Come on.

1:10:32.462 --> 1:10:34.362
So, what so you guys
want for Christmas this year?

1:10:34.497 --> 1:10:35.930
Hmm. Besides a pony?

1:10:36.032 --> 1:10:36.965
Besides that.

1:10:37.100 --> 1:10:38.233
[all laugh]

Wouldn't mind Vivienne
laying off a little.

no life outside of work

-doesn't mean we don't.
-Tell me about it.

Georgia, I--I'm sorry.

1:10:49.713 --> 1:10:52.380
It's okay. Vivienne
can be a little intense.

"Intense".

1:10:53.917 --> 1:10:55.583

1:10:55.719 --> 1:10:57.352
Like who doesn't hire
their own sister for a job?

1:10:57.487 --> 1:10:59.687
Like, I get strictly
business, but...

1:10:59.823 --> 1:11:02.523
It's true. Vivienne's
always worked too much.

1:11:02.626 --> 1:11:06.027
Always been stubborn,
always needed things her way.

1:11:06.162 --> 1:11:08.863
But it wasn't easy
after Mom left.

1:11:08.999 --> 1:11:11.466
Every Christmas I had
presents under the tree.

1:11:12.802 --> 1:11:15.870
Vivienne gave up her childhood
so that I could have one.

1:11:16.006 --> 1:11:19.073
I don't want to work for her
just to stay close to you.

1:11:19.109 --> 1:11:21.976
Though that's an added benefit.

1:11:22.145 --> 1:11:23.945
I want to work for her...

1:11:25.315 --> 1:11:27.482
because she's my hero.

1:11:36.126 --> 1:11:38.126
It's quite a haul this year.

1:11:38.261 --> 1:11:40.528
Well, Santa's elves
are always working.

1:11:40.697 --> 1:11:42.764

to Vivienne.

1:11:45.268 --> 1:11:47.769
These gifts come courtesy

Merry Christmas, Luanne.

1:11:50.373 --> 1:11:51.372
Merry Christmas.

1:11:55.578 --> 1:11:59.681
You make sure these kids
have gifts every year.

1:11:59.816 --> 1:12:01.449
You have so much love
in your heart,

1:12:01.584 --> 1:12:03.651
you have no choice
but to spread it around.

1:12:04.821 --> 1:12:06.654
Every child deserves
a good Christmas.

1:12:06.790 --> 1:12:08.156
You did, too.

1:12:08.258 --> 1:12:09.857
You know what it's like
to go without.

1:12:09.893 --> 1:12:13.061
That's why you hold on
so hard to what you have.

1:12:13.997 --> 1:12:17.465
The lesson you needed
to learn isn't that
you're a lousy person.

1:12:17.567 --> 1:12:19.834
We wouldn't have gone
to all this trouble.

1:12:19.936 --> 1:12:22.804
The lesson you needed to learn
is much harder than that.

1:12:22.906 --> 1:12:26.808
You needed to see just
how wonderful you are.

Honestly, I wasn't
looking for you.

But when I'm feeling lost,
I just try to find
somewhere to sing.

so long without everything

1:21:12.735 --> 1:21:14.768
this is my home.

1:21:14.904 --> 1:21:16.937
I can't move to L.A.

1:21:17.073 --> 1:21:19.106
Hmm.

1:21:19.208 --> 1:21:22.943
Well, I guess you're
gonna rack up a lot
of frequent flyer miles.

1:21:23.079 --> 1:21:25.446
-You're serious?
-[chuckles]

1:21:25.548 --> 1:21:29.049
Normally, I would never let
someone commute from Nashville
to produce the IMAs.

1:21:29.185 --> 1:21:30.718
Something tells me
you could pull it off.

1:21:30.786 --> 1:21:31.919
I can.

1:21:32.021 --> 1:21:33.053
I'm sure you can.

1:21:33.155 --> 1:21:34.722
Merry Christmas, you two.

1:21:34.857 --> 1:21:36.056
-Merry Christmas, Henry.
-Merry Christmas.

1:21:36.192 --> 1:21:38.158
[soft music]

1:21:39.295 --> 1:21:40.895
I have to say, I agree with him.

1:21:42.098 --> 1:21:43.797
Um...

1:21:43.933 --> 1:21:46.133
There's been something
I've been meaning to show you.

1:21:51.474 --> 1:21:53.741
<i> My name's Gavin Chase,</i>
<i> and I'm ten years old.</i>

1:21:54.744 --> 1:21:57.645
<i> My best friend's name</i>
<i> is Vivienne, and...</i>

1:21:57.813 --> 1:22:00.514
<i> I hope we're best friends</i>
<i> forever.</i>

1:22:01.450 --> 1:22:02.449
[inhales]

1:22:03.419 --> 1:22:04.952
You told me the tape was full.

1:22:05.021 --> 1:22:07.321
There might have been a
little bit more space there.

1:22:07.456 --> 1:22:08.856
Just a little bit?

1:22:08.991 --> 1:22:11.759
[romantic music]

1:22:11.894 --> 1:22:13.961
I'm done...

1:22:14.096 --> 1:22:16.297
putting work before
the people I care about.

1:22:18.200 --> 1:22:20.467
And I'm done needing to
have everything my own way.

1:22:20.603 --> 1:22:21.969
I'm willing to compromise.

1:22:22.104 --> 1:22:23.671
-Really?
-[chuckles]

1:22:23.773 --> 1:22:26.440
But. But-but-but...

1:22:26.475 --> 1:22:28.909
there's one thing
I won't compromise on.

1:22:29.512 --> 1:22:30.711
What's that?

1:22:30.846 --> 1:22:32.579
It's how I feel about you.

1:22:33.582 --> 1:22:36.050
You know, everything that kid
said on that tape is true.

1:22:37.453 --> 1:22:39.720
So if we're gonna be
best friends forever, then...

1:22:40.589 --> 1:22:42.222
I guess I just fell in love
with my best friend.

1:22:42.391 --> 1:22:43.624
[chuckles]

1:22:49.532 --> 1:22:51.598
Hey, actually, uh...
can you leave that?

1:22:51.734 --> 1:22:52.800
Thanks.

1:22:54.537 --> 1:22:56.103
[laughs]

1:22:57.340 --> 1:22:58.872
Oh.

1:22:58.975 --> 1:23:01.041
-How convenient.
-Very convenient.

1:23:01.210 --> 1:23:04.712
[joyful music]
