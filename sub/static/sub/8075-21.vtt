00:00.534 --> 00:02.670
[music playing]

00:03.737 --> 00:06.040
[theme music]

00:09.477 --> 00:10.411
Roseanne.

00:10.444 --> 00:11.645
You know who that is?

00:11.679 --> 00:13.481
That's Cindy Kenner
from "Wake Up Chicago."

00:13.514 --> 00:15.383
She's on every
morning at 6:00 AM.

00:15.416 --> 00:16.917
Oh, well, I never
see it because I never

00:16.950 --> 00:19.720
stay up that late anymore.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.055
Excuse me.

00:21.089 --> 00:22.223
You the manager?

00:22.256 --> 00:23.124
Uh, no.

00:23.157 --> 00:25.025
Actually, I am the owner.

00:25.059 --> 00:29.097
Well, actually, he's
one of four owners,

00:29.130 --> 00:31.565
uh, that own this place equally.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.734
I'm Roseanne Conner,
the main owner.

00:33.767 --> 00:36.204
Oh, nice to meet you.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.639
I'm Joe Matthews, producer
of "Wake Up Chicago."

00:38.672 --> 00:40.574
Listen, if you don't mind,
we're here to do some man

00:40.608 --> 00:41.475
on the street interviews.

00:41.509 --> 00:42.376
Would that be all right?

00:42.410 --> 00:43.844
Of course that's all right.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.213
You just make yourself
right at home.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.347
Hi.
- Thank you.

00:46.380 --> 00:50.084
Jackie Harris,
owner number three.

00:50.118 --> 00:50.984
Very nice to meet you.

00:51.018 --> 00:52.120
Yeah, you too-- you too.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.021
All right, let's get
started then, huh?

00:54.054 --> 00:58.259
He is very good looking,
and I did not see a ring.

00:58.292 --> 00:59.593
Careful, Jackie.

00:59.627 --> 01:03.164
He might spot your dorsal
fin moving through the water.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.698
OK, our reporter--

01:04.732 --> 01:07.601
Cindy Kenner-- will
ask the questions.

01:07.635 --> 01:10.704
Hi, I'm Cindy.

01:10.738 --> 01:14.775
Hi, I'm Roseanne.

01:14.808 --> 01:18.446
Say, could I possibly get
a little bit of Pellegrino?

01:18.479 --> 01:21.915
You could, if I knew
what the hell that was.

01:21.949 --> 01:25.186
Sorry, I forgot where I was.

01:25.219 --> 01:27.555
You were in between
asking me for a drink

01:27.588 --> 01:30.224
and getting punched in the face.

01:30.258 --> 01:31.592
Here we go.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.927
Let's start with him here, and
then her, and then her, OK?

01:33.961 --> 01:34.828
Here we go.

01:34.862 --> 01:38.199
Ready, in three, two, one.

01:38.232 --> 01:41.502
Today, we've come to
the little town of Lanford

01:41.535 --> 01:43.637
to ask some local
restaurant people

01:43.671 --> 01:46.039
the question that's
on everyone's lips

01:46.073 --> 01:47.575
this election year.

01:47.608 --> 01:51.078
Is beef back?

01:51.111 --> 01:52.646
Does she have to think
of all these questions

01:52.680 --> 01:55.216
every single day?

01:55.249 --> 01:57.251
When does she find
the time to not eat?

02:04.692 --> 02:07.795
Is beef back?

02:07.828 --> 02:11.232
Here at the Lunch Box, located
on Route 9 just half a mile

02:11.265 --> 02:16.670
south of Hanging Bad Caverns,
we serve beef to our customers.

02:19.773 --> 02:20.708
So beef is good.

02:23.811 --> 02:27.315
And remember, Leon
recommends lean.

02:29.783 --> 02:30.584
OK.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.623
So is beef back?

02:35.656 --> 02:39.260
Um, well, I am going to
have to agree with Leon that,

02:39.293 --> 02:42.463
uh, low fat is the way to go.

02:42.496 --> 02:46.400
But today, there are leaner
cuts of beef, so who knows?

02:46.434 --> 02:49.903
Maybe some day beef won't
have any fat at all,

02:49.937 --> 02:52.573
because the future is now!

02:52.606 --> 02:54.608
And who knows what
that's going to bring?

02:54.642 --> 02:57.578
Maybe-- maybe we won't
even have beef, or cows,

02:57.611 --> 02:59.813
or cars, or we're just--

02:59.847 --> 03:01.148
We'll wear those
jet pack things,

03:01.181 --> 03:02.850
and we'll just fly all over
and wherever we want to go,

03:02.883 --> 03:04.051
you know?

03:04.084 --> 03:06.854
And we'll eat food made
out of-- oh, I don't know,

03:06.887 --> 03:10.023
just old newspapers and air.

03:10.057 --> 03:12.860
Oh, to be young again.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.262
OK.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.263
So, hi, Andy.

03:15.296 --> 03:18.532
Mommy's on TV!

03:18.566 --> 03:20.268
Hi.

03:20.301 --> 03:21.935
Is beef back?

03:21.969 --> 03:23.604
Well, I just want to
say that the only thing

03:23.637 --> 03:25.072
I don't like about
fat is that it

03:25.105 --> 03:28.876
doesn't have any sugar in it.

03:28.909 --> 03:32.112
OK, but doesn't a fatty diet--

03:32.145 --> 03:34.648
I mean, won't it make you fat?

03:34.682 --> 03:35.483
So?

03:38.419 --> 03:40.454
A lot of people
are fat, you know?

03:40.488 --> 03:43.524
In fact, I think more
American women look like me

03:43.557 --> 03:46.226
than like you, you know?

03:46.260 --> 03:48.596
Yeah, but when you watch TV,
there's like no fat people on

03:48.629 --> 03:49.797
or anything.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.332
Like, when I watch that
show "Friends," you know,

03:51.365 --> 03:52.933
that has all those whiny
girls that are nothing

03:52.966 --> 03:55.135
but hair and bones, you know?

03:55.168 --> 03:56.704
And, like, I watch
them and they're,

03:56.737 --> 03:58.972
like, drinking those
triple espressos and stuff.

03:59.006 --> 04:02.843
And I'm just like, hey,
go for the muffins!

04:02.876 --> 04:06.780
It kind of bugs me,
you know, because uh--

04:06.814 --> 04:10.050
I feel like, hey, I eat the same
amount of food that they eat.

04:10.083 --> 04:14.187
I just don't puke when I'm done.

04:14.221 --> 04:17.591
[theme music]

04:54.895 --> 04:56.364
[laughter]

04:57.365 --> 05:00.734
[music playing]

05:03.371 --> 05:05.406
I must say, planning
a wedding for you

05:05.439 --> 05:08.642
and Darlene is such a thrill.

05:08.676 --> 05:11.345
Of course, my
wedding gown is going

05:11.379 --> 05:13.481
to have to be let out
a bit to accommodate

05:13.514 --> 05:17.184
her little bun in the oven.

05:17.217 --> 05:18.852
Mrs. Harris, uh--

05:18.886 --> 05:21.188
Don't worry, I haven't
forgotten about you!

05:21.221 --> 05:23.724
I've already called
Vales and Tails.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.993
They have plenty of
tuxes in your size.

05:26.026 --> 05:30.798
Why, they fit boys as
young as four years old.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.400
That's very nice, but, uh--

05:32.433 --> 05:35.335
But what?

05:35.369 --> 05:37.738
We need music.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.072
Do you have any ideas?

05:39.106 --> 05:41.174
Only scarce.

05:41.208 --> 05:44.412
[laughs] Oh, Darlene,
there you are.

05:44.445 --> 05:47.381
Well, you've missed all
the wedding planning fun.

05:47.415 --> 05:49.016
But David will catch you up.

05:49.049 --> 05:55.288
Now, I'll make myself disappear
so you two love birds can coo.

05:57.858 --> 05:58.626
Poof!

06:04.031 --> 06:06.600
Well, I hope whatever she's
on becomes over-the-counter

06:06.634 --> 06:07.568
in our lifetime.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.506
Now, what the hell
is going on in here?

06:12.540 --> 06:15.809
My grandmother has lots
of ideas for our wedding.

06:15.843 --> 06:18.311
And you were
saying OK to them?

06:18.345 --> 06:20.280
She's just trying to be nice.

06:20.313 --> 06:23.116
Like, David, that's
just her cover.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.185
God, and you think you're
going to be a Conner.

06:25.218 --> 06:28.121
No, I thought you
were going to be Healy?

06:28.155 --> 06:31.559
Oh, we'll get to that later.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.827
Tell her no.
- What?

06:33.861 --> 06:35.395
All these wedding plans
she's roped you into,

06:35.429 --> 06:37.064
you've got to tell her no.

06:37.097 --> 06:38.632
I can't just say no.

06:38.666 --> 06:40.267
Well, can you say,
ow, quit it, Darlene?

06:45.439 --> 06:47.074
OK, fine.

06:47.107 --> 06:48.275
How do I do it?

06:48.308 --> 06:49.977
Well, you've got to be tough.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.211
You've got to stay firm.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.313
She's a really
crafty manipulator.

06:53.346 --> 06:54.648
Here, practice saying no to me.

06:59.119 --> 06:59.920
No.

07:04.658 --> 07:05.659
That's it.

07:05.693 --> 07:06.960
I'm going to go get
mom to coach you.

07:06.994 --> 07:09.530
No.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.765
Very good.

07:11.799 --> 07:14.568
[music playing]

07:15.903 --> 07:17.037
ROSEANNE CONNER
(ON TV): --screens.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.939
Go for the muffins!

07:18.972 --> 07:22.510
You know, because I figure I
eat the same amount of food

07:22.543 --> 07:23.410
that they eat.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.079
I just don't puke when I'm done.

07:34.121 --> 07:37.357
I'm wonderful.

07:37.390 --> 07:41.228
Well, nobody loves
Roseanne like Roseanne, huh?

07:41.261 --> 07:44.264
Oh, you're just bitter because
they cut all of your stuff out.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.066
Well, that's
not entirely true.

07:46.099 --> 07:50.638
They did leave in that
pithy epigram, beef is good.

07:50.671 --> 07:53.941
Three more words
than I got in.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.576
I'm really proud
of you, honey.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.310
You were great this morning.

07:57.344 --> 07:58.411
Thanks, doll.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.247
And remember me when
the ballots come out

08:00.280 --> 08:02.983
for the People's Choice Awards.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.685
You got it.

08:04.718 --> 08:05.853
Oh wait, if I vote
for that, will I

08:05.886 --> 08:06.787
get called for jury duty?

08:09.289 --> 08:10.190
Hey, Roseanne.

08:10.223 --> 08:11.859
Hey, what are you
doing back here?

08:11.892 --> 08:13.126
Hi, Joe.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.328
You know normally my hair
is a lot higher than this,

08:15.362 --> 08:21.201
but even the most perfect hair
can't stand up to beef steam.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.502
Nice to see you again, Jackie.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.404
Listen, uh, can I talk
to your sister for a sec?

08:24.437 --> 08:25.305
Huh?

08:25.338 --> 08:26.907
Oh, uh, yeah.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.076
Sure.

08:29.109 --> 08:32.946
I was just in Elgin on a
story, another kid in the well,

08:32.980 --> 08:34.181
you know?

08:34.214 --> 08:36.884
Anyway, I thought I'd drop
by and tell you the news.

08:36.917 --> 08:37.918
A kid in a well.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.620
It kind takes you
back, huh, ditch?

08:47.227 --> 08:50.097
Roseanne, your appearance
on the show this morning,

08:50.130 --> 08:51.832
it was fantastic.

08:51.865 --> 08:55.068
I mean, your whole opinionated
blue collar outlook,

08:55.102 --> 08:56.269
people just loved it.

08:56.303 --> 08:59.206
Oh, see, Dan, all these
years everybody thought

08:59.239 --> 09:03.844
I was a bitch, but what I had
was an opinionated blue collar

09:03.877 --> 09:06.446
outlook.

09:06.479 --> 09:08.281
How would you like to
come on the show next week

09:08.315 --> 09:10.684
and be a commentator
on "Wake Up Chicago?"

09:10.718 --> 09:13.687
Yeah, and I'll give you a
handful of these magic beans.

09:13.721 --> 09:14.722
I'm serious.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.223
We want you to come
on the show and do

09:16.256 --> 09:18.458
a one minute piece commenting
on anything you want.

09:18.491 --> 09:19.359
Oh.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.260
What do you say?

09:20.293 --> 09:22.630
Oh, my god.

09:22.663 --> 09:23.664
Oh my god.

09:23.697 --> 09:24.765
Honey, that's incredible!

09:24.798 --> 09:26.900
Don't forget us when
you're famous, mom.

09:26.934 --> 09:27.735
Who are you?

09:31.238 --> 09:36.243
I don't know who he is, but I
am the wind beneath your wings.

09:36.276 --> 09:39.246
All right, let's
slow down here, people.

09:39.279 --> 09:42.049
I'll handle this.

09:42.082 --> 09:46.620
Uh, speaking as
Roseanne's manager--

09:46.654 --> 09:47.955
Whatever.

09:47.988 --> 09:53.126
We're going to have to work
out a couple of things here.

09:53.160 --> 09:57.230
That's really-- you don't
mind if I do that, do you?

09:57.264 --> 10:00.100
All right, first of all,
what's the pay scale?

10:00.133 --> 10:01.568
What size dressing
room does she have?

10:01.601 --> 10:03.136
And when we walk into
that dressing room,

10:03.170 --> 10:04.838
are we going to
find a fruit basket?

10:04.872 --> 10:06.774
Jackie-- Jackie,
it's all right.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.408
She'll be paid
very well for this.

10:08.441 --> 10:08.842
Uh huh.
Uh huh.

10:08.876 --> 10:09.977
Uh huh.

10:10.010 --> 10:10.811
Well, that's all well
and good, but I'm not

10:10.844 --> 10:14.147
hearing the words fruit basket.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.215
Fruit basket.

10:15.248 --> 10:18.551
I think we can make
this thing happen!

10:18.585 --> 10:19.887
I'm real excited
about this, Roseanne.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.154
Listen, we'll give
you a call with all

10:21.188 --> 10:22.289
the details, all right?
- Great.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.357
And then, I guess we'll
see you in the studio.

10:24.391 --> 10:25.292
She'll be there.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.860
And, uh, maybe you
and I should get

10:26.894 --> 10:28.428
together for a couple of beers.
- Yeah.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.529
And you hammer
off the details.

10:29.562 --> 10:30.530
Yeah, yeah.

10:30.563 --> 10:32.232
You know, dot the
Is cross the Ts--

10:32.265 --> 10:34.167
you call me day or night!

10:34.201 --> 10:36.904
I am very hot on this project!

10:36.937 --> 10:37.805
I can't believe it.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.673
I-- I don't-- I--

10:39.707 --> 10:41.842
I better start thinking about
what I would even say on there,

10:41.875 --> 10:42.743
you know?

10:42.776 --> 10:44.111
Oh, hon.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.479
I happen to think that so a
lot of stuff does tick me off--

10:46.513 --> 10:52.452
you know, like, politicians,
and big corporations, and him.

10:55.222 --> 10:56.857
Gee, Rose, do you
really think they're

10:56.890 --> 10:58.959
going to let you go on TV
and say anything you want?

10:58.992 --> 11:02.329
Dan-- Dan, don't
get involved in things

11:02.362 --> 11:05.332
you don't know anything about.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.768
Yeah, because that's
what the guy said.

11:07.801 --> 11:10.403
He said they wanted my
opinionated blue collar

11:10.437 --> 11:11.604
outlook, you know.

11:11.638 --> 11:13.240
And that's just what
they're going to get, too--

11:13.273 --> 11:17.244
Roseanne uncensored.

11:17.277 --> 11:18.678
Oh, dear god.

11:18.712 --> 11:23.316
She is already referring to
herself in the third person.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.551
Hey!

11:24.584 --> 11:26.186
If she wants to refer to
herself in the third person,

11:26.219 --> 11:27.721
there's not a damn thing
you can do about it.

11:27.755 --> 11:28.555
She's a star!

11:32.125 --> 11:34.895
[music playing]

11:37.831 --> 11:38.698
Hi.

11:38.732 --> 11:39.967
Hi, David.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.334
Sorry I'm late.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.837
I had a brainstorm
on the way over.

11:46.874 --> 11:51.078
I've decided to drape
the pews with Battenburg

11:51.111 --> 12:01.321
lace to create a hallowed
yet whimsical aura of love.

12:01.354 --> 12:02.122
No.

12:06.794 --> 12:07.660
You're right.

12:07.694 --> 12:08.962
We don't have to drape it.

12:08.996 --> 12:11.131
We can fan it.

12:11.164 --> 12:13.700
Good for you.

12:13.733 --> 12:17.838
Oh, I've auditioned a
marvelous band for the wedding.

12:17.871 --> 12:22.642
Dave, Don and his swing
cats-- very peppy.

12:22.675 --> 12:24.477
No.

12:24.511 --> 12:25.678
No, Mrs. Harris.

12:25.712 --> 12:30.350
No to the band, no to the
lace, no to all of it.

12:30.383 --> 12:34.654
You're cute, teasing your--

12:34.687 --> 12:37.024
oh, why not say it, even
though it's two weeks away?

12:37.057 --> 12:38.191
Teasing your grandma.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.627
[laughter]

12:42.695 --> 12:45.498
Mrs. Harris, I am
sorry, but Darlene

12:45.532 --> 12:46.766
and I talked about this.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.903
And we decided that we are
planning the wedding alone

12:49.937 --> 12:51.404
without your help.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.305
What?

12:52.339 --> 12:53.206
I'm serious.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.107
That's it.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.075
It's over, the end.

12:58.611 --> 13:04.384
But, David, I didn't get to
plan a wedding for either one

13:04.417 --> 13:06.386
of my own daughters.

13:06.419 --> 13:09.556
Becky eloped.

13:09.589 --> 13:13.326
I probably won't be around
for DJ's wedding or--

13:13.360 --> 13:14.227
or Jerry's.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.563
I'm getting old, David.

13:16.596 --> 13:19.299
Darlene was my
last chance at a--

13:19.332 --> 13:21.234
a real wedding.

13:21.268 --> 13:22.702
[sobbing]

13:23.703 --> 13:25.272
Oh, please, give me a break.

13:28.208 --> 13:32.412
But all my plans, David!

13:32.445 --> 13:34.581
This is so lame.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.083
Boo hoo hoo.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.550
Oh!

13:37.584 --> 13:38.618
You're a horrible boy!

13:38.651 --> 13:39.452
Horrible!

13:43.023 --> 13:46.927
Hey, Darlene,
look who's crying.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.795
[sobbing]

13:48.828 --> 13:50.030
David.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.098
You were right.

13:51.131 --> 13:54.034
She tried everything,
but I stood firm.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.302
She's never cried before.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.938
God, what'd you do to her?

13:57.971 --> 13:58.939
Right.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.374
But you said, be
prepared, that she would

14:01.408 --> 14:03.043
try every trick in the book.

14:03.076 --> 14:06.846
I told you to stand firm, not
completely crush her dreams.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.081
Now, what are you
going to do next,

14:08.115 --> 14:09.449
tell her Charlton Heston is gay?

14:13.286 --> 14:15.488
But you--

14:15.522 --> 14:16.389
Come on, grandma.

14:16.423 --> 14:17.390
I'll make you some tea.

14:17.424 --> 14:18.291
Come on.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.627
We were talking so pleasantly.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.996
And all of a sudden
he just attacked me!

14:28.035 --> 14:30.904
[music playing]

14:33.506 --> 14:36.143
As rescue workers continue
to sift through the rubble,

14:36.176 --> 14:38.678
the tragic death
toll stands at seven,

14:38.711 --> 14:42.149
but it's expected to climb
during the rest of the day.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.050
Thanks, Don.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.184
Hey!

14:44.217 --> 14:47.354
It's Kids Are King Day
at the Lincoln Park Zoo.

14:47.387 --> 14:51.391
Let's go there for the cutest
report you've ever seen.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.760
Excuse me,
sweetheart-- sweetheart!

14:53.793 --> 14:55.162
Easy with the cotton swab.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.297
My client's skin
is her livelihood.

15:02.469 --> 15:03.636
Can you believe it, Jackie?

15:03.670 --> 15:06.306
This is the same studio
where Oprah does her show.

15:06.339 --> 15:09.009
Roseanne, we are
on sacred ground.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.444
Who would have ever thought
that a little girl that grew up

15:11.478 --> 15:13.380
in Lanford, Illinois
would make it all

15:13.413 --> 15:16.716
the way to Chicago, Illinois?

15:16.749 --> 15:17.951
Hey, Roseanne.

15:17.985 --> 15:20.787
I just wanted to let you
know that we are all really

15:20.820 --> 15:22.189
excited to have you here.

15:22.222 --> 15:23.156
Yeah, thanks.

15:23.190 --> 15:23.991
Good luck.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.597
Hey, hitch up
your skirt a little.

15:30.630 --> 15:31.931
Your skeleton's showing.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.237
Oh, hello.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.173
I'm Rulelenska.

15:40.207 --> 15:41.074
Hey, Roseanne.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.409
Hi, Jackie.

15:42.442 --> 15:43.410
Oh, hi.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.045
How you doing?

15:45.078 --> 15:46.613
Oh, you know, I'm just--

15:46.646 --> 15:48.615
I like your slacks.

15:48.648 --> 15:49.549
Thanks.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.284
Well, we're almost ready.

15:51.318 --> 15:53.586
You've got any
questions, Roseanne?

15:53.620 --> 15:55.655
Yeah, where--
where's the bagels?

15:55.688 --> 15:56.856
Come on.

15:56.889 --> 15:58.191
I'll walk you
through the studio.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.460
You're on in a
couple of minutes.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.229
I like your slacks.

16:02.262 --> 16:03.997
Why don't you just pin
him up against the table?

16:06.699 --> 16:07.567
Oh, my god.

16:07.600 --> 16:08.868
Oh, my god, look.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.970
I can't believe it.

16:11.004 --> 16:13.440
I can't believe I'm
meeting Don Samuels.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.341
Hi.

16:14.374 --> 16:15.375
I'm glad to meet you, too.

16:15.408 --> 16:16.276
Welcome aboard.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.110
Wow, thanks.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.615
Can you get me a bagel?

16:22.649 --> 16:25.018
Oh, we have people
who bring those to you.

16:25.052 --> 16:27.987
Oh.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.956
I'll get you one.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.224
Three minutes, Joe.

16:31.258 --> 16:32.559
OK, let's set
you up, Roseanne.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.361
Have a seat over here.
- Already?

16:34.394 --> 16:35.628
Cause, I mean, we
haven't even talked

16:35.662 --> 16:37.197
about what I'm going to say.

16:37.230 --> 16:38.698
What's to talk about?
I read it.

16:38.731 --> 16:39.599
I loved it.

16:39.632 --> 16:40.500
Yeah?

16:40.533 --> 16:41.968
You loved it as is?

16:42.001 --> 16:43.936
I mean, OK, you
loved it, but I bet

16:43.970 --> 16:45.672
all the-- the suits hated it.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.374
No, everyone loved it.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.242
Even Cindy liked it.

16:49.276 --> 16:50.643
So we're just, like--

16:50.677 --> 16:52.612
just going to go
ahead then, huh?

16:52.645 --> 16:55.215
In 2 and 1/2 minutes.

16:55.248 --> 16:58.785
Jackie, do you, uh, care to
watch in the booth with me?

16:58.818 --> 16:59.819
In the booth?
Sure.

16:59.852 --> 17:00.720
Go in a booth?

17:00.753 --> 17:01.554
Yeah, sure.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.127
To watch what?
Oh, the show.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.895
Oh, OK, yeah.

17:08.928 --> 17:10.330
Yeah, sure, OK.

17:10.363 --> 17:13.766
So good luck.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.169
Uh, uh, I need a
minute with my manager.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.070
What?

17:17.104 --> 17:18.771
What do you need?

17:18.805 --> 17:20.740
Go pull the car around.
We're getting out of here.

17:20.773 --> 17:21.641
What do you mean?

17:21.674 --> 17:22.575
You're on in two minutes!

17:22.609 --> 17:23.910
Oh, no, I don't
think I can do it.

17:23.943 --> 17:24.877
No, sure you can.

17:24.911 --> 17:25.878
You heard what Joe said.

17:25.912 --> 17:26.979
Everybody here loves you.

17:27.013 --> 17:28.181
They think you're
going to be great.

17:28.215 --> 17:30.583
Yeah, I know, but that's
the problem, Jackie.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.485
You know, I'm not used
to people liking me.

17:32.519 --> 17:34.754
I mean, if they thought
I sucked or something,

17:34.787 --> 17:36.323
I'd be like I'll
show those bastards.

17:36.356 --> 17:37.824
And then I could blow
them away, you know?

17:37.857 --> 17:39.025
That's how I am.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.294
But everybody's thinking--
expecting me to be good.

17:41.328 --> 17:42.662
I just-- I just don't--

17:42.695 --> 17:43.863
I just don't think
I can deliver.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.166
But-- but, Roseanne, see,
I've never seen you lack

17:46.199 --> 17:47.634
confidence like this before.

17:47.667 --> 17:48.901
And that gets me all weak.

17:48.935 --> 17:51.003
And I just-- I
can't take that now,

17:51.037 --> 17:52.705
you know, not with everything
else that's going on.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.707
I mean, Fred called the other
day, and I was so upset.

17:54.741 --> 17:55.708
And then called me right back.

17:55.742 --> 17:56.609
And I hung up on him.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.778
This is so not about you!

17:58.811 --> 18:01.548
Well, but what
are we going to do?

18:01.581 --> 18:05.118
As soon as that chimp puts
down the accordion, you are on.

18:05.152 --> 18:06.018
Well, I don't know.

18:06.052 --> 18:07.154
You're my manager.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.189
Fix it, or make me feel
better, or something!

18:13.160 --> 18:13.960
Go get 'em.

18:16.963 --> 18:18.198
You are fired.

18:21.734 --> 18:24.304
That felt kind of good.

18:24.337 --> 18:26.105
Well, wait-- wait.

18:26.139 --> 18:27.440
Just think of it this way, see.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.376
You're all scared, because
everybody thinks you're great

18:29.409 --> 18:30.743
and you don't have confidence.
- Stop it.

18:30.777 --> 18:31.811
Stop saying that.
Stop saying that.

18:31.844 --> 18:33.213
Well, that's the
only way I can say it.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.547
But look at it this way, see.

18:34.581 --> 18:38.751
Everybody out there in TV
land is expecting you to fail.

18:38.785 --> 18:39.652
No, they're not.

18:39.686 --> 18:42.389
Oh, sure-- oh, yes they are.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.924
Oh, look at yourself.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.693
Come on!

18:46.726 --> 18:50.997
You don't look like a-- a
Cindy, or the Diane Sawyer,

18:51.030 --> 18:52.932
or any other woman on TV.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.601
See, as soon as they
see you, they are

18:54.634 --> 18:57.504
going to instantly dislike you.
- No, they're not.

18:57.537 --> 19:00.006
Sure, and then the moment
you open your mouth, I mean,

19:00.039 --> 19:03.343
that voice, god!

19:03.376 --> 19:05.845
So that's two
strikes against you

19:05.878 --> 19:08.548
right in the very first
second of the broadcast.

19:08.581 --> 19:10.850
Two strikes, huh?
Go on.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.986
Well, they're-- they're,
you know, like-- well, hey.

19:14.020 --> 19:18.991
Hey, who is this big-boned
loud mouth banshee that's

19:19.025 --> 19:20.793
polluting my living room?

19:20.827 --> 19:22.929
Hey, May, get the remote!

19:22.962 --> 19:23.830
Change it!

19:23.863 --> 19:25.164
I don't care to watch.

19:25.198 --> 19:26.966
Just get this off my screen!

19:30.537 --> 19:32.872
You're not just saying
that to make me feel better.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.241
Roseanne, think about it.

19:34.274 --> 19:38.445
There's 2 million people out
there waiting for you to fail.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.413
2 million?

19:40.447 --> 19:41.248
Plus mom.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.489
Out of my way, Jackie.

19:49.522 --> 19:52.392
It's time to wake up Chicago.

19:52.425 --> 19:55.495
Atta girl, and
mash your hair up!

19:55.528 --> 19:57.464
You show them the true Roseanne.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.466
Well, I kind of liked
what they did with my hair

19:59.499 --> 20:00.533
with the things and everything.

20:00.567 --> 20:01.401
No, I liked what
they did with it, too.

20:01.434 --> 20:01.968
- OK.
- It looks really good.

20:02.001 --> 20:03.570
So you go girl!

20:06.806 --> 20:08.174
OK, everybody, here we go!

20:08.207 --> 20:10.543
In 5, 4, 3, 2--

20:10.577 --> 20:11.844
Welcome back.

20:16.849 --> 20:20.620
Now it's time to meet Roseanne
Conner with her special report

20:20.653 --> 20:22.289
from the heartland.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.923
Roseanne?

20:23.956 --> 20:26.459
Yeah, hello.

20:26.493 --> 20:28.261
Well, while I've been
here in the big city,

20:28.295 --> 20:30.229
I noticed that
what you guys call,

20:30.263 --> 20:32.565
uh, daycare we--
in a small town--

20:32.599 --> 20:34.367
we just call it babysitting.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.469
I think you take a lot of
things that are pretty simple

20:36.503 --> 20:38.471
and make them way
too complicated.

20:38.505 --> 20:41.140
You know, granted, moving
all the holidays to Monday

20:41.173 --> 20:44.076
was pure genius, but
now Tuesday sucks.

20:51.651 --> 20:54.086
Hey, Don, you want to know
what really gets my goat?

20:54.120 --> 20:55.221
No, what?

20:55.254 --> 20:57.857
It's those over-chilled
little packs of butter

20:57.890 --> 20:59.959
they give you in restaurants.

20:59.992 --> 21:00.993
I mean, come on.

21:01.027 --> 21:04.030
They're just way too hard!

21:04.063 --> 21:06.165
I prefer whipped butter.

21:06.198 --> 21:09.135
How about you, Don?

21:09.168 --> 21:11.170
Butter?

21:11.203 --> 21:13.072
Do you really think
I want to sit here

21:13.105 --> 21:15.708
and talk to you about butter?

21:15.742 --> 21:18.711
I-- I am a real journalist.

21:18.745 --> 21:20.913
I was covering the Korean
War while your father

21:20.947 --> 21:25.184
was chasing your mother
around the sock hop.

21:25.217 --> 21:29.689
I've got shrapnel in
my knee older than you.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.090
Butter?

21:31.123 --> 21:36.195
If I have to listen to one more
of your stupid, inane stories,

21:36.228 --> 21:38.498
I am going to open
a [bleep] vein!

21:44.571 --> 21:47.239
So whipped it is!
