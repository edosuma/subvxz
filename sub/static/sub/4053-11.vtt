00:00.090 --> 00:01.722
Previously on Suits...

00:01.724 --> 00:04.159
Mike Ross never went to law school.

00:04.194 --> 00:07.729
I knew it, and I hired him anyway.

00:07.765 --> 00:09.364
I still can't stay, Harvey.

00:09.399 --> 00:10.966
You're making it seem like I'm the one

00:11.001 --> 00:12.600
that's taking away your dream wedding.

00:12.636 --> 00:15.303
You are the one taking
away my dream wedding.

00:15.338 --> 00:16.638
Nothing would make me happier

00:16.674 --> 00:18.373
than to raise a glass to your new life,

00:18.408 --> 00:19.440
but I can't.

00:19.476 --> 00:20.642
Oh, so now I shouldn't get married.

00:20.678 --> 00:22.010
No, I'm saying you should quit.

00:22.046 --> 00:23.344
You tell me right now, why are you here?

00:23.380 --> 00:24.780
- It's not that simple.
- Why are you here?

00:24.815 --> 00:27.115
Because I'm afraid!

00:27.151 --> 00:28.516
You're calling for an emergency vote

00:28.552 --> 00:29.785
of no confidence today?

00:29.820 --> 00:31.687
Take a picture, because
tomorrow morning,

00:31.722 --> 00:33.689
those letters are coming down.

00:33.724 --> 00:35.356
Why should I believe
you would even live up

00:35.392 --> 00:36.558
to your end of the bargain?

00:36.593 --> 00:38.259
Because I don't give a shit

00:38.295 --> 00:40.095
about your war with Daniel Hardman.

00:40.130 --> 00:43.932
All I want to do is see you get
down on your knees and say,

00:43.967 --> 00:45.433
"I quit."

00:45.468 --> 00:48.770
As of now, the company that's
been targeting our clients

00:48.806 --> 00:51.306
is no longer represented
by Daniel Hardman.

00:51.341 --> 00:54.642
All in favor of Jessica staying?

00:55.310 --> 00:58.628
How exactly did you get that
termination letter for Forstman?

00:58.828 --> 01:00.148
I agreed to step down.

01:00.184 --> 01:02.050
You are not going to step down.

01:02.086 --> 01:04.419
You've given up
everything for this firm.

01:04.453 --> 01:06.722
It's time someone gave
up something for you.

01:06.757 --> 01:08.924
Harvey, you didn't
just give me my dream.

01:08.959 --> 01:10.291
You gave me a family.

01:10.327 --> 01:12.961
But I'm gonna have a
family of my own someday,

01:12.996 --> 01:15.296
and I can't have all of this
hanging over their heads.

01:15.332 --> 01:16.798
You don't have to do this for me.

01:16.834 --> 01:18.466
I'm doing it for us,

01:18.501 --> 01:19.801
'cause as long as you're with me...

01:19.837 --> 01:20.869
I'm with you.

01:22.272 --> 01:24.606
- Michael James Ross.
- Yes?

01:24.641 --> 01:27.642
You're under arrest for
conspiracy to commit fraud.

01:43.460 --> 01:45.994
Michael Ross, I'm Assistant U.S.
Attorney Anita Gibbs,

01:46.029 --> 01:47.796
and unlike you, I'm a real attorney.

01:47.831 --> 01:49.197
I'm not answering any questions

01:49.233 --> 01:50.331
until I speak to my lawyer.

01:50.367 --> 01:51.800
I heard you asked for him before,

01:51.835 --> 01:54.169
but while we're waiting, I
just wanted to let you know

01:54.204 --> 01:57.639
that I'm the one who's
gonna put you in jail.

01:57.674 --> 02:00.041
Nothing?

02:00.077 --> 02:03.278
Maybe you think that you've
committed a victimless crime,

02:03.313 --> 02:06.281
but let me assure you, you haven't.

02:06.316 --> 02:09.449
By my estimation, you've
worked on 88 legal cases

02:09.485 --> 02:11.486
in your so-called career,

02:11.521 --> 02:14.990
and you committed fraud every
time you picked up the phone,

02:15.025 --> 02:16.925
mailed a letter, signed your name,

02:16.960 --> 02:18.794
or appeared in court.

02:18.829 --> 02:21.663
Each instance carries a
nine-month sentence,

02:21.698 --> 02:22.964
and to tell you the truth,

02:23.000 --> 02:24.833
I am too tired to do the addition.

02:24.868 --> 02:26.168
Well, I'm not.

02:26.203 --> 02:28.569
If what you're saying is true

02:28.605 --> 02:30.305
and there's a limit of
one count per case,

02:30.340 --> 02:32.841
then I'll be going to
prison for 66 years.

02:34.278 --> 02:36.278
I've always been good at math.

02:36.313 --> 02:37.545
Well, I haven't.

02:37.580 --> 02:39.647
But what I am good at is putting away

02:39.683 --> 02:42.150
fake, cocky tough guys like you

02:42.186 --> 02:44.786
and seeing them break.

02:44.822 --> 02:47.355
So here's how this is gonna go.

02:47.390 --> 02:50.325
You play ball, I go easy on you.

02:50.360 --> 02:51.860
You don't...

02:51.895 --> 02:54.296
in my experience,

02:54.331 --> 02:56.231
college boys, even fake ones,

02:56.266 --> 02:58.200
don't do well in prison.

03:00.204 --> 03:01.937
And if you think your people

03:01.972 --> 03:03.638
are rushing down here to bail you out,

03:03.673 --> 03:05.040
you've got another thing coming,

03:05.075 --> 03:07.909
because I'm gonna keep
you in here all night.

03:11.414 --> 03:14.082
Okay.

03:14.117 --> 03:17.452
I'll confess.

03:17.487 --> 03:20.088
But I want the whole thing on tape.

03:26.529 --> 03:28.263
Harvey, thank God. I
need to talk to you.

03:28.298 --> 03:29.831
Rachel, calm down. What's going on?

03:29.867 --> 03:31.032
- Mike's been arrested.
- What?

03:31.068 --> 03:32.267
Two men from the U.S.
Attorney's Office...

03:32.302 --> 03:34.169
they just walked right up to
him, and they arrested him.

03:34.204 --> 03:35.503
I don't know what to do.

03:35.538 --> 03:36.671
All right. It's gonna be okay.

03:36.706 --> 03:37.973
It's not gonna be okay! He's by himself.

03:38.008 --> 03:39.140
- We have to do something.
- I am.

03:39.176 --> 03:40.408
I'm going down there right now.

03:40.443 --> 03:41.376
No, you're not.

03:41.411 --> 03:42.344
Jessica, this isn't up for you...

03:42.379 --> 03:43.982
Harvey, from this second,

03:43.983 --> 03:46.195
you are an unindicted co-conspirator,

03:46.196 --> 03:47.271
and so am I.

03:47.272 --> 03:48.359
And so are you,

03:48.395 --> 03:51.362
which means none of us can
afford to be anywhere near Mike.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.531
I don't care. Someone
has to do something.

03:53.566 --> 03:56.167
And if it isn't going to be
you, it's going to be me.

03:56.202 --> 03:57.601
You're gonna let her go down there?

03:57.637 --> 03:59.404
Harvey, she can knock on
that door all she wants.

03:59.439 --> 04:00.604
They're not gonna let
her see him tonight.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.140
Besides, she's his fiancÃ©e.

04:02.175 --> 04:04.042
Seeing him is not gonna
make her look guilty.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.609
It's not gonna make me
look guilty either.

04:05.645 --> 04:07.511
It makes me look like
I'm standing by my guy.

04:07.547 --> 04:09.680
No, what's gonna keep
you from looking guilty

04:09.715 --> 04:11.916
is you and I ripping up
your letter of resignation.

04:11.952 --> 04:14.215
Jessica, I just made a
deal with Forstman.

04:14.216 --> 04:15.716
He finds out that I'm still here,

04:15.752 --> 04:17.418
he picks up the phone, calls Hardman,

04:17.452 --> 04:19.119
and the two of them
pick this place apart.

04:19.154 --> 04:20.755
And if whoever is prosecuting this case

04:20.790 --> 04:22.222
finds out you left on the same night

04:22.258 --> 04:24.140
they arrested Mike,

04:24.141 --> 04:25.673
then we may as well turn ourselves in.

04:25.709 --> 04:27.342
Which is why I need to get in there

04:27.377 --> 04:31.113
and talk to Mike as his lawyer.

04:31.148 --> 04:33.582
Then this is what's going to happen.

04:33.617 --> 04:35.817
You are now his lawyer.

04:35.852 --> 04:37.419
But you do whatever you have to do

04:37.454 --> 04:38.686
to work out of your house,

04:38.722 --> 04:41.689
because I'm not telling
anybody you resigned.

04:43.529 --> 04:46.096
This is AUSA Anita Gibbs
with Michael Ross.

04:46.131 --> 04:47.765
The time is 11:05 p.m.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.400
Mr. Ross has agreed to confess,

04:49.435 --> 04:51.902
with the stipulation that
he do it on videotape.

04:51.937 --> 04:53.471
I actually never said I'd confess.

04:53.506 --> 04:54.739
I said I'd talk.

04:55.159 --> 04:57.425
You did say you'd confess.

04:58.428 --> 04:59.728
Maybe I did, but then again,

04:59.764 --> 05:01.864
I also asked to see my lawyer at 9:03.

05:01.899 --> 05:02.931
It's two hours later,

05:02.967 --> 05:04.432
and I still haven't
been able to do that,

05:04.468 --> 05:05.801
which means anything that I've said

05:05.836 --> 05:07.970
between then and now is
not only inadmissible,

05:08.005 --> 05:10.272
it's also evidence that
you violated my rights.

05:10.932 --> 05:13.032
Oh, I get it. You just
wanted to get that on tape.

05:13.067 --> 05:14.100
Sure did.

05:14.135 --> 05:15.935
And if I don't see my lawyer in an hour,

05:15.970 --> 05:17.837
you better be able to prove
that you've made every effort

05:17.873 --> 05:20.707
to contact him and couldn't.

05:20.742 --> 05:22.509
I know I'm not supposed
to know these things

05:22.544 --> 05:25.845
because I'm not a lawyer, but I do...

05:27.348 --> 05:28.415
Because I am.

05:28.450 --> 05:30.216
Okay, you've had your fun.

05:30.251 --> 05:31.651
Now I'm gonna have mine.

05:31.686 --> 05:34.320
Your lawyer actually did
show up about half hour ago.

05:34.355 --> 05:36.155
There seemed to be a
little miscommunication

05:36.190 --> 05:37.557
about what room you were in,

05:37.592 --> 05:39.392
but that's all been straightened out.

05:39.428 --> 05:40.960
So...

05:40.995 --> 05:43.430
here he is.

05:47.042 --> 05:48.008
Robert.

05:48.043 --> 05:49.243
Oh, I see.

05:49.278 --> 05:51.345
You thought you were
gonna see Harvey Specter

05:51.380 --> 05:54.047
come in this room so you two
could get your stories straight.

05:54.082 --> 05:56.049
Apparently that's not gonna happen.

05:56.084 --> 05:58.619
Now, normally this is the
part where I leave the room,

05:58.654 --> 06:02.189
but almost looks like
you want me to stay.

06:02.224 --> 06:05.225
Just so you know, we
can't watch or record

06:05.261 --> 06:06.926
anything that happens in here...

06:06.962 --> 06:09.863
attorney-client privilege and whatnot.

06:09.898 --> 06:11.498
But if you're innocent of these charges,

06:11.534 --> 06:13.233
I'm sure you have nothing to fear,

06:13.269 --> 06:15.935
being alone in this room...

06:15.971 --> 06:18.338
with that man.

06:59.142 --> 07:00.944
What are you doing here, Robert?

07:00.979 --> 07:04.113
Rachel called me and
asked me to help you.

07:04.148 --> 07:05.482
- Is she okay?
- No.

07:05.856 --> 07:07.189
She's not,

07:07.224 --> 07:09.825
because she's out there,
and you're in here.

07:09.860 --> 07:11.559
And so you're gonna tell me right now,

07:11.594 --> 07:14.429
is this shit true?

07:14.464 --> 07:15.730
Listen, I can explain everything.

07:15.765 --> 07:16.731
I don't need an explanation!

07:16.766 --> 07:17.966
I want an answer to
the goddamn question.

07:18.001 --> 07:19.301
Lawyers don't ask that question.

07:19.336 --> 07:20.735
I'm not asking you as your lawyer.

07:20.770 --> 07:23.004
I'm asking you as a man.

07:28.174 --> 07:29.507
You know what the answer is.

07:29.542 --> 07:30.875
God damn it.

07:35.414 --> 07:37.015
You wanted the truth,
and now you got it,

07:37.050 --> 07:38.750
but you got to tell me what
are you doing here, Robert.

07:38.785 --> 07:42.586
I told you, I'm here because
Rachel begged me to help you...

07:42.622 --> 07:45.690
not because I give a shit
about what happens to you.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.023
So you're gonna do exactly what I say,

07:48.059 --> 07:49.759
and I'm gonna help you
get out of this thing.

07:52.797 --> 07:54.664
No, there's no getting
out of this thing.

07:54.699 --> 07:57.132
Oh, yes, there is, and
you damn well know it.

07:57.860 --> 08:01.195
That woman doesn't get anything
by prosecuting a fraud like you,

08:01.230 --> 08:03.164
but she would love to
get Harvey Specter.

08:03.199 --> 08:04.231
I'm not turning on Harvey.

08:04.267 --> 08:05.266
Oh, he would do

08:05.301 --> 08:06.667
the same goddamn thing
to you in a heartbeat.

08:06.702 --> 08:07.868
If you think that, then
you don't know Harvey.

08:07.903 --> 08:09.170
You better listen to me!

08:09.205 --> 08:11.605
You better get your
head out of your ass,

08:11.640 --> 08:13.607
because I'm throwing you
a goddamn lifeline.

08:13.642 --> 08:14.975
It's the only chance you're gonna get

08:15.010 --> 08:18.145
to save what's left of
your miserable life.

08:18.420 --> 08:20.986
I won't do it.

08:21.022 --> 08:22.622
Then you are on your own.

08:26.536 --> 08:27.602
Robert, please...

08:27.637 --> 08:29.370
Whatever you're gonna say...

08:29.406 --> 08:30.806
don't say it.

08:31.337 --> 08:33.870
The truth is, you're doing me a favor,

08:33.905 --> 08:35.272
because after I got you out of this,

08:35.308 --> 08:36.773
I was gonna tell you to
stay away from Rachel

08:36.808 --> 08:38.140
for the rest of your life,

08:38.177 --> 08:41.078
but I don't have to do it now,

08:41.113 --> 08:43.647
because you're gonna wind
up in prison anyway.

08:56.888 --> 08:59.522
Louis.

08:59.557 --> 09:02.157
- What's going on?
- Donna, I need to come in.

09:06.097 --> 09:07.262
What happened?

09:07.298 --> 09:08.698
Donna, I need you to sit down.

09:08.733 --> 09:11.968
- Louis...
- I said you need to sit down.

09:12.003 --> 09:14.737
What happened to Harvey?

09:14.772 --> 09:16.338
Please tell me that he's okay.

09:16.374 --> 09:18.407
Mike's been arrested.

09:18.442 --> 09:21.010
Oh, my God.

09:21.045 --> 09:23.045
- We have to go see him.
- No, no, no.

09:23.080 --> 09:24.413
We can't go anywhere near him.

09:24.448 --> 09:26.549
- What?
- You can't go down there.

09:26.584 --> 09:28.751
Louis, so help me God, if
you turn your back on Mike

09:28.786 --> 09:30.887
and you claim that this has
nothing to do with you...

09:30.922 --> 09:31.988
Just listen to me.

09:32.023 --> 09:33.122
You're gonna want to
do everything you can

09:33.157 --> 09:34.824
to get to Mike and express your support,

09:34.859 --> 09:36.392
but I am telling you,

09:36.427 --> 09:38.494
that is a bad idea.

09:38.530 --> 09:39.762
Then I need to talk to Harvey.

09:39.797 --> 09:41.130
No, you don't.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.440
You need to stay the
hell away from him, too,

09:43.475 --> 09:46.310
and count your blessings that
you don't work for him anymore,

09:46.345 --> 09:47.477
'cause if all of a sudden

09:47.513 --> 09:49.346
you start showing up on his doorstep,

09:49.382 --> 09:52.682
you are gonna find yourself next
up on the prosecutor's list.

09:52.718 --> 09:54.451
Louis, this is Mike and
Harvey we're talking about.

09:54.486 --> 09:56.153
- They're family.
- I am not saying they're not.

09:56.188 --> 09:58.289
I'm saying the more contact
you have with them,

09:58.324 --> 09:59.723
the worse it is for all of us.

09:59.758 --> 10:03.260
Okay, I won't go down there.

10:04.069 --> 10:05.501
But I am going to see Rachel,

10:05.536 --> 10:07.170
and if you think you're gonna stop me,

10:07.205 --> 10:08.905
you are out of your mind.

10:13.511 --> 10:15.745
I am telling you, I am his attorney.

10:15.780 --> 10:16.813
If you don't let me see him,

10:16.848 --> 10:18.581
I'm gonna break through that door.

10:18.616 --> 10:21.150
You can bluster all you want,
but you're not getting in

10:21.186 --> 10:22.518
because he's already with his attorney.

10:22.553 --> 10:24.486
- What?
- You dirty son of a bitch.

10:24.522 --> 10:25.688
Robert, calm down.

10:25.724 --> 10:27.156
I'm not calming shit.

10:27.192 --> 10:28.891
You brought this kid into my life.

10:28.927 --> 10:30.827
You put my daughter's
future in jeopardy.

10:30.862 --> 10:32.261
- Look, I know you're upset...
- Upset?

10:32.296 --> 10:35.631
You're lucky I don't
lay you out right now.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.136
Robert, listen to me.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.138
Mike Ross is a good man.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.607
He came to me from nothing.

10:41.642 --> 10:42.941
I saw something in him,

10:42.976 --> 10:44.576
and you did, too, and
that's why you're here.

10:44.612 --> 10:46.177
No, I was here to get
him to turn on you,

10:46.213 --> 10:47.679
but he's too stupid to do that.

10:48.020 --> 10:50.153
And I don't know if he's gonna
change his mind or not,

10:50.188 --> 10:51.487
but I don't care anymore,

10:51.523 --> 10:56.092
and I don't give a damn if I
ever see either of you again.

10:56.127 --> 10:57.427
Did you hear that?

10:57.462 --> 10:59.729
He's not Mike Ross's
attorney anymore... I am.

10:59.765 --> 11:01.798
So let me the hell in.

11:05.236 --> 11:07.303
Robert Zane? Really?

11:07.338 --> 11:08.504
I'm hurt.

11:08.540 --> 11:10.040
- Harvey, this is real.
- I know.

11:10.075 --> 11:11.942
And the first we need to figure
out is who tipped them off.

11:11.977 --> 11:13.309
Why the hell do we need to do that?

11:13.344 --> 11:14.578
Because if we're gonna
get you out of this,

11:14.613 --> 11:16.179
we have to know every damn
thing they have on you.

11:16.214 --> 11:17.647
Are you crazy? There's
no getting out of this.

11:17.683 --> 11:19.849
I haven't lost a case before,
and I'm not about to start now.

11:19.885 --> 11:21.184
This isn't just some other case.

11:21.219 --> 11:22.719
They're gonna check the
facts, and when they do...

11:22.754 --> 11:24.253
They're gonna find
what we let them find.

11:24.289 --> 11:26.695
- You can't know that.
- Yes, I can.

11:26.696 --> 11:28.696
- That's bullshit!
- This is not bullshit!

11:28.732 --> 11:29.964
Look, we can win this case.

11:29.999 --> 11:31.699
I don't care about winning this thing.

11:31.735 --> 11:32.667
What the hell is wrong with you?

11:32.702 --> 11:34.402
Harvey, I did this!

11:44.894 --> 11:49.030
You didn't do shit because
they don't have shit.

11:51.700 --> 11:53.767
What the hell are you talking about?

11:53.803 --> 11:56.304
Mike, you're in the Harvard database.

11:56.339 --> 11:58.172
You have a transcript.

11:58.207 --> 11:59.340
You're in the bar.

11:59.375 --> 12:01.309
You're a practicing attorney.

12:01.344 --> 12:02.810
Those facts are real,

12:02.845 --> 12:04.412
just like every case you ever worked on

12:04.447 --> 12:06.347
and every person you've
helped along the way.

12:09.076 --> 12:10.541
Harvey, this woman's not joking.

12:10.577 --> 12:12.844
That woman has to show you're a fraud,

12:12.880 --> 12:14.813
but as far as the world knows,
you're a goddamn lawyer,

12:14.848 --> 12:16.447
and that's the way it's gonna stay.

12:16.483 --> 12:17.949
And don't forget...

12:17.985 --> 12:19.450
we don't need to prove you're a lawyer.

12:19.486 --> 12:21.820
She needs to prove you're not.

12:23.857 --> 12:25.190
Rachel, calm down.

12:25.225 --> 12:26.457
I can't calm down.

12:26.493 --> 12:28.559
No one will tell me anything.
I can't go and see him.

12:28.595 --> 12:29.995
It is the worst moment of his life,

12:30.030 --> 12:31.640
and I'm not there for him.

12:31.641 --> 12:32.706
Well, you will be when you can.

12:32.742 --> 12:34.074
On top of all that,

12:34.109 --> 12:36.843
I don't know what my dad's
gonna do when he gets there.

12:36.879 --> 12:39.146
You called your dad?

12:39.181 --> 12:41.382
Rachel, I don't think
that was a good idea.

12:41.417 --> 12:42.883
Well, I couldn't just sit
here and do nothing.

12:42.918 --> 12:44.117
Mike's been arrested.

12:44.153 --> 12:46.987
Jessica's talking about
unindicted co-conspirators.

12:47.022 --> 12:48.789
Okay, well then, he and Harvey
will just have to work it out.

12:48.824 --> 12:50.391
And what if they don't?

12:51.022 --> 12:52.889
Rachel, when I was in trouble,

12:52.924 --> 12:54.590
Harvey got me out of it.

12:54.625 --> 12:56.225
This is what he does.

12:56.261 --> 13:00.129
I am telling you, he will
get Mike out of this.

13:00.164 --> 13:01.563
It's just...

13:02.733 --> 13:05.467
The thought of him...

13:05.503 --> 13:07.970
in there all alone.

13:08.006 --> 13:10.373
He'll be okay.

13:10.408 --> 13:13.575
It's just one night.

13:21.979 --> 13:23.511
Man, what are you looking at?

13:23.546 --> 13:24.579
Nothing.

13:24.614 --> 13:26.348
Your eyes are going up
and down on me, man.

13:26.383 --> 13:28.783
It don't feel like nothing.

13:28.818 --> 13:31.786
They all say, "Nothing.
Wasn't doing nothing."

13:32.607 --> 13:35.056
It don't matter what you say
and do once you're inside.

13:35.092 --> 13:37.459
Little snot like you won't last a week.

13:39.687 --> 13:41.420
You hear what I said?

13:41.456 --> 13:42.888
You won't last a week in there.

13:42.924 --> 13:44.490
You might not last a night in here.

13:44.525 --> 13:45.858
Listen, man...

13:47.628 --> 13:49.695
Hey! Get your hands off
him, you piece of shit.

13:51.165 --> 13:52.364
You're lucky, but they
won't be here all night.

13:52.399 --> 13:53.599
Yeah, neither will you.

13:53.634 --> 13:54.767
Hey, it's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

13:54.802 --> 13:56.836
Leave him in here with me. It's cool.

13:56.871 --> 13:59.037
I mean, unless you're gonna
let a federal marshal

13:59.073 --> 14:00.873
beat the shit out of me
just to try and scare me

14:00.908 --> 14:02.140
into making a deal.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.347
Agent Ron Da'Mico, right?

14:11.577 --> 14:14.145
Yeah, I saw your picture out in the hall

14:14.180 --> 14:16.380
getting a commendation from the U.S.
Attorney.

14:16.416 --> 14:19.083
Of course, you didn't have
a beard in that photo,

14:19.118 --> 14:20.717
but you look the same to me.

14:20.753 --> 14:23.020
You're a smart kid.

14:23.056 --> 14:25.289
I guess that's how you got away
with what you got away with.

14:25.324 --> 14:29.927
But you didn't really get
away with it, did you?

14:30.548 --> 14:33.282
I am a marshal, but the
next guy won't be,

14:33.317 --> 14:35.184
and you give him that
know-it-all attitude,

14:35.219 --> 14:37.687
and like I said, you won't last a night.

14:40.224 --> 14:42.659
Yeah, well, for the record,
I'm not getting sent away,

14:42.694 --> 14:45.427
but even if I was, it wouldn't
be a place like that.

14:45.463 --> 14:47.864
Oh, if you think you're
going to Club Fed...

14:47.899 --> 14:50.599
You don't know Anita Gibbs.

14:50.635 --> 14:52.334
Sleep well, sweetheart.

15:08.900 --> 15:10.466
How is he?

15:10.501 --> 15:12.101
He's in custody.

15:12.594 --> 15:15.228
And the bail hearing?

15:15.263 --> 15:16.696
I don't know,

15:16.731 --> 15:18.163
because I'm not representing him.

15:18.199 --> 15:19.865
Now, are you done asking me questions?

15:19.900 --> 15:21.200
Because I have a few of my own,

15:21.236 --> 15:24.270
like how the hell could you do this?

15:24.305 --> 15:26.372
Dad, because I love him.

15:26.407 --> 15:28.407
That's sweet, but you
sound like a teenager,

15:28.443 --> 15:30.742
and right now your mother is sobbing,

15:30.743 --> 15:32.143
knowing what you've done to yourself.

15:32.178 --> 15:35.379
Dad, Mike is the same man
that you worked with.

15:35.414 --> 15:37.081
And you said yourself there are things

15:37.116 --> 15:39.316
that you did in your past
that you're not proud of.

15:39.351 --> 15:41.252
Don't you dare compare me to him.

15:41.810 --> 15:43.410
I am not a fraud.

15:43.445 --> 15:45.044
I am not a criminal.

15:51.353 --> 15:53.653
Rachel...

15:53.689 --> 15:57.190
Rachel...

15:57.465 --> 15:59.832
I tried to get him out,

15:59.868 --> 16:01.467
but he's living in a dream world,

16:01.502 --> 16:03.302
and so are you if you
think this boy is done

16:03.337 --> 16:04.336
ruining your life.

16:04.372 --> 16:05.572
Why did you even come here?

16:05.607 --> 16:08.697
I came here to tell you
to look in the mirror

16:08.698 --> 16:11.166
and get rid of him.

16:13.670 --> 16:17.105
I can't do that.

16:25.859 --> 16:28.559
Then I can't help you.

16:46.815 --> 16:48.615
I was wondering when you
were gonna pay me a visit.

16:48.651 --> 16:49.650
You know who I am?

16:49.685 --> 16:50.984
I know everyone in my crosshairs.

16:51.019 --> 16:53.353
Now pass me the cream and
tell me what you want.

16:53.389 --> 16:55.522
I want to know why you
arrested my associate

16:55.557 --> 16:57.090
without just cause.

16:57.125 --> 16:58.692
Because Mike Ross is a fraud,

16:58.727 --> 17:00.327
and I'm gonna make sure he never sees

17:00.362 --> 17:01.895
the inside of a courtroom again,

17:01.930 --> 17:03.830
unless he's wearing an orange jumpsuit.

17:04.794 --> 17:06.184
If you'll excuse me,

17:06.185 --> 17:08.018
I have an arraignment to prepare for.

17:08.053 --> 17:10.854
What if I was to tell you off the record

17:10.888 --> 17:12.622
Mike Ross was about to resign?

17:12.656 --> 17:14.457
I'd say that sounds very convenient.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.159
Well, it isn't. I'm
telling you the truth.

17:16.194 --> 17:17.260
And if your interest really is

17:17.295 --> 17:18.729
in getting him out of the courtroom,

17:18.763 --> 17:19.963
he was gonna do it himself.

17:19.998 --> 17:21.531
And why should I believe you?

17:21.566 --> 17:23.532
I can get you his letter of resignation.

17:23.568 --> 17:24.935
All you have to do is waive charges,

17:24.970 --> 17:28.638
and I'll get him to agree
never to practice law again.

17:29.421 --> 17:31.489
I'll tell you what I'll do.

17:31.524 --> 17:34.525
You get me that letter,
and I'll waive his bail.

17:34.560 --> 17:35.726
I don't need you to waive bail.

17:35.761 --> 17:37.060
Whatever it is, he can pay for it.

17:37.096 --> 17:39.296
No, he can't. I'll freeze his assets.

17:39.331 --> 17:42.833
In fact, I'll make sure that
he doesn't get bail at all,

17:42.869 --> 17:45.035
because hacking into the
bar is a federal crime,

17:45.070 --> 17:46.336
and if he can do that,

17:46.372 --> 17:48.271
he sure as hell can flee the country.

17:48.307 --> 17:50.509
You have no proof he
hacked into the bar.

17:50.510 --> 17:52.544
Doesn't matter. It's
what he's accused of.

17:52.579 --> 17:55.646
So you want to make sure he
walks out of court today,

17:55.682 --> 17:57.482
you bring me the letter.

18:08.840 --> 18:11.507
That better be you calling
down to my office

18:11.543 --> 18:13.043
to explain why your golden boy

18:13.078 --> 18:15.145
was arrested for fraud last night.

18:15.180 --> 18:17.080
My golden boy?

18:17.115 --> 18:18.848
You're the one that
nominated him for partner.

18:18.883 --> 18:21.151
Because you passed him
over again and again,

18:21.186 --> 18:22.986
and I knew there was a reason for it,

18:23.021 --> 18:25.388
but now I know what it was.

18:25.424 --> 18:27.857
- Just what are you implying?
- I'm not implying anything.

18:27.892 --> 18:29.292
You knew that kid was a fraud,

18:29.328 --> 18:31.061
and even if you didn't, you should have.

18:31.096 --> 18:32.495
So what is it?

18:32.530 --> 18:34.264
Are you corrupt, or are
you just so stupid

18:34.299 --> 18:35.999
you didn't know what was
going on in your own firm?

18:36.034 --> 18:38.468
Watch who you're calling stupid, Jack,

18:38.503 --> 18:42.047
'cause you were the only idiot with his
hands in his pockets at that vote.

18:42.247 --> 18:43.271
I didn't have their support then,

18:43.307 --> 18:45.039
but I will now, because Harvey's protÃ©gÃ©

18:45.075 --> 18:47.141
just got perp-walked out of this firm.

18:47.667 --> 18:50.401
And since then, Harvey's
nowhere to be found.

18:50.436 --> 18:52.136
Harvey's whereabouts are
none of your concern.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.738
Well, the partners are concerned.

18:53.773 --> 18:55.699
They need a leader they can trust.

18:55.700 --> 18:57.700
And I'll bet someone's
trying to convince them

18:57.736 --> 18:58.735
that leader is you.

18:58.770 --> 19:00.036
Well, look at that.

19:00.071 --> 19:02.439
You do know what's going on
in your own firm after all.

19:02.474 --> 19:05.475
I'm gonna give you some advice
from the throne, free of charge.

19:05.511 --> 19:09.346
You attack this firm's
leadership when it's in crisis

19:09.381 --> 19:12.582
over an unproven allegation...

19:12.618 --> 19:15.084
you're gonna look like a bottom-feeder.

19:15.350 --> 19:17.283
And even if they vote me out,

19:17.318 --> 19:20.387
they sure as hell won't vote you in.

19:26.440 --> 19:28.206
Donna, what are you doing here?

19:28.241 --> 19:29.708
Gretchen told me you
weren't feeling well,

19:29.743 --> 19:31.142
so I dropped by to see how you're doing

19:31.177 --> 19:32.778
and tell you to cut the bullshit.

19:32.813 --> 19:34.145
I don't understand.

19:34.180 --> 19:36.415
You've never taken a
sick day in your life,

19:36.450 --> 19:37.547
and Mike just got arrested,

19:37.587 --> 19:39.682
so I want to know what
the hell is going on.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.522
I can't be in the office right now.

19:41.554 --> 19:44.550
Why not?

19:44.595 --> 19:46.193
Because I resigned.

19:46.228 --> 19:47.999
What?

19:48.029 --> 19:49.295
Because of Mike?

19:49.327 --> 19:51.223
Because it's the only way to
get Forstman to back off.

19:51.264 --> 19:52.764
I don't care about Forstman.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.166
You're leaving the firm
when we need you the most?

19:55.201 --> 19:58.837
Donna, right now I have to
stay away from the office,

19:58.872 --> 20:00.371
but I'm not leaving anyone.

20:00.407 --> 20:01.506
I'm representing Mike.

20:01.542 --> 20:02.607
So you saw him.

20:02.643 --> 20:04.776
- Last night.
- And?

20:04.812 --> 20:05.877
He's hanging in.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.648
I just need this bail
hearing to go smoothly.

20:08.649 --> 20:10.382
What do you mean, go smoothly?
What's going on?

20:10.418 --> 20:11.783
The prosecutor's playing hardball.

20:11.819 --> 20:13.285
She's trying to keep him without bail.

20:13.321 --> 20:15.154
Harvey, Rachel is not doing well.

20:15.189 --> 20:17.222
You have to get him out of there.

20:19.126 --> 20:20.192
Then I need you

20:20.227 --> 20:22.461
to get something from the office for me.

20:29.079 --> 20:29.996
"HI"

20:33.234 --> 20:35.835
I understand you've reached
an agreement to waive bail?

20:35.870 --> 20:36.836
We have, Your Honor.

20:36.871 --> 20:38.871
No bail is requested at this time.

20:38.906 --> 20:40.840
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

20:40.875 --> 20:42.842
However, I would like
to introduce a motion

20:42.877 --> 20:46.378
to have Mr. Specter removed
as attorney for Mr. Ross.

20:46.413 --> 20:47.612
- What?
- On what grounds?

20:47.648 --> 20:48.981
On the grounds that they conspired

20:49.016 --> 20:51.951
to defraud the bar association,
every client they ever had,

20:51.986 --> 20:53.452
and the people of the United States.

20:53.487 --> 20:54.954
What's your proof?

20:54.989 --> 20:57.456
This letter showing Mr.
Ross was going to resign.

20:57.491 --> 20:59.091
They conspired to fabricate it.

20:59.126 --> 21:01.293
- We had a deal.
- I don't care what we had.

21:02.146 --> 21:04.312
The two of them concocted a story

21:04.347 --> 21:06.414
under the guise of
attorney-client privilege,

21:06.449 --> 21:07.783
which they were only able to do

21:07.818 --> 21:10.351
because Mr. Specter is both
his boss and his attorney.

21:10.387 --> 21:12.054
I gave you that letter in good faith.

21:12.089 --> 21:14.289
You gave me that letter
in a blatant attempt

21:14.324 --> 21:16.825
to get me to drop charges
against your co-conspirator.

21:16.860 --> 21:19.127
That is slander and inadmissible.

21:19.163 --> 21:22.998
That's enough. My chambers...
ten minutes.

21:25.169 --> 21:27.468
- You gave her that letter?
- I did it to get you out.

21:27.504 --> 21:29.037
I don't care about getting bail

21:29.073 --> 21:30.405
if it lands us both in prison.

21:30.440 --> 21:31.873
It's not gonna land us in prison,

21:31.909 --> 21:33.141
and it would've come out anyway.

21:33.177 --> 21:34.876
We can't just destroy
every piece of evidence.

21:34.912 --> 21:36.377
Oh, we can't do anything
with any piece of evidence

21:36.413 --> 21:37.979
because she's about to get
you kicked off my case.

21:38.015 --> 21:39.581
She has no grounds to kick me off.

21:39.616 --> 21:40.916
We didn't conspire to write that letter.

21:40.953 --> 21:42.483
But we conspired to do something else,

21:42.513 --> 21:43.554
in case you forgot.

21:43.588 --> 21:44.987
Then we better come up with something,

21:45.023 --> 21:46.726
and we better come up with it fast.

21:52.726 --> 21:55.061
I'm not in the habit of
removing counsel, Ms. Gibbs.

21:55.099 --> 21:56.964
And I'm not in the habit
of having an accomplice

21:57.002 --> 21:58.584
be the attorney on a case.

21:58.582 --> 22:00.015
I'm entitled to representation.

22:00.054 --> 22:01.120
And you had it last night.

22:01.155 --> 22:03.690
Your attorney of record
is listed as Robert Zane.

22:04.129 --> 22:06.395
The only reason you
want me off this case

22:06.431 --> 22:08.632
is so you can pressure
Robert into making my client

22:08.667 --> 22:10.133
take your bullshit offer.

22:10.168 --> 22:11.801
The reason I want you off this case

22:11.837 --> 22:13.770
is because you're an
unindicted co-conspirator.

22:13.805 --> 22:15.705
If he's an unindicted
co-conspirator, then so are you.

22:15.741 --> 22:16.740
Excuse me?

22:16.775 --> 22:17.974
You violated my client's rights

22:18.010 --> 22:20.844
the night he was arrested,
and we have it on tape.

22:21.488 --> 22:25.189
That is a complete fabrication
based on the word of a con man.

22:25.225 --> 22:26.924
An alleged con man with
a photographic memory,

22:26.960 --> 22:28.159
Your Honor.

22:28.194 --> 22:29.461
And what does that have
to do with anything?

22:29.496 --> 22:30.862
Because if I'm lying
about a digital tape,

22:30.897 --> 22:32.130
then how do I know the serial number

22:32.165 --> 22:34.332
of the camera you use
in your interrogation?

22:34.690 --> 22:37.490
RKZ986532.

22:37.525 --> 22:41.861
Little piece of blue tape
keeping the battery attached.

22:42.422 --> 22:44.122
You want to remove your motion,

22:44.157 --> 22:47.791
or do I have to subpoena that camera?

22:47.827 --> 22:49.427
I'll withdraw my motion, Your Honor.

22:49.462 --> 22:51.329
You're free to go, Mr. Ross,

22:51.364 --> 22:53.131
and Mr. Specter is your attorney.

23:00.155 --> 23:02.455
All this proves is that you
two were in on this together.

23:02.490 --> 23:04.791
What this proves is you'll
do anything to win,

23:04.826 --> 23:07.393
and now the judge knows it, and so do I.

23:13.825 --> 23:15.291
Louis, put down whatever you're doing.

23:15.327 --> 23:16.225
What do you need?

23:16.261 --> 23:17.427
I need you to make sure

23:17.462 --> 23:19.028
there's nothing in the
bylaws Jack Soloff can use

23:19.064 --> 23:21.431
to call for a vote and get me out.

23:21.742 --> 23:22.974
Well, I can tell you right now,

23:23.009 --> 23:24.509
he can't do anything for two weeks,

23:24.545 --> 23:26.144
but after that, there's nothing
we can do to stop him.

23:26.179 --> 23:27.846
Then I need you to figure out a Plan B,

23:27.881 --> 23:28.913
because in two weeks...

23:28.949 --> 23:30.349
Wait a second. Why isn't Harvey here?

23:30.384 --> 23:31.383
What do you mean?

23:31.418 --> 23:32.751
I mean it's his firm as much as ours.

23:32.786 --> 23:34.253
He's the one who started
this whole thing,

23:34.288 --> 23:37.203
so there must be a reason he's not here.

23:37.204 --> 23:38.569
Harvey's working on Mike's defense.

23:38.605 --> 23:40.638
Oh, God damn it, that
makes us all look guilty

23:40.673 --> 23:42.407
and puts us all in jeopardy, Jessica.

23:42.442 --> 23:44.209
That was my reaction too.

23:44.244 --> 23:45.543
And then I realized

23:45.578 --> 23:48.146
this allows us to communicate
with Mike and each other,

23:48.181 --> 23:49.280
and it's all privileged.

23:49.316 --> 23:51.516
Then I want it said right now...

23:51.551 --> 23:52.517
Donna stays out of it.

23:52.552 --> 23:53.885
That's not gonna be a problem,

23:53.920 --> 23:56.354
because Harvey doesn't
work here anymore.

23:56.390 --> 23:57.355
What?

23:57.391 --> 24:00.748
He resigned to get Forstman to back off.

24:00.749 --> 24:02.148
Well, then let me guess...

24:02.184 --> 24:03.817
the prosecutor can't know he did that,

24:03.852 --> 24:05.518
and Forstman can't know he didn't.

24:05.553 --> 24:07.153
- Exactly.
- Jesus Christ, Jessica.

24:07.189 --> 24:08.688
If Harvey's not here, that even makes us

24:08.724 --> 24:10.056
more vulnerable to Jack.

24:10.092 --> 24:12.058
Which is why I need you to step up

24:12.094 --> 24:14.160
and figure out a way to
keep that son of a bitch

24:14.196 --> 24:15.695
from taking me out.

24:30.110 --> 24:31.442
Are you okay?

24:31.477 --> 24:32.710
I am now.

24:38.999 --> 24:40.433
You're out.

24:40.468 --> 24:44.804
And I have no intention
of ever going back in.

24:46.307 --> 24:47.807
What are we gonna do now?

24:47.842 --> 24:50.108
I'll you what we're gonna do.

24:50.144 --> 24:51.977
We're gonna go on offense.

24:52.012 --> 24:53.412
What does that mean?

24:53.448 --> 24:55.748
It means finding out what she
knows and how she knows it.

24:55.783 --> 24:57.350
And it starts with us
getting into a room,

24:57.385 --> 24:59.618
making a list of every goddamn person

24:59.654 --> 25:01.253
who knows the truth.

25:06.893 --> 25:08.393
Donna, what are you doing in here?

25:08.428 --> 25:09.660
I need your help.

25:09.696 --> 25:10.828
Don't you mean, "Thanks
for working late, Donna.

25:10.863 --> 25:12.163
May I ask for you
assistance with something?"

25:12.199 --> 25:13.498
No, I mean Jack Soloff

25:13.533 --> 25:15.533
is crawling up our collective
asses, and I need you to...

25:15.569 --> 25:18.603
- What is that?
- It's a private matter.

25:18.638 --> 25:21.239
Mike Ross's employment records?

25:21.274 --> 25:22.440
God damn it, Donna.

25:22.476 --> 25:23.874
- You're doing work for Harvey?
- Louis...

25:23.910 --> 25:26.478
I explicitly told you to
stay away from Mike's case.

25:26.513 --> 25:29.080
And I heard you.

25:29.116 --> 25:32.517
I just don't care.

25:32.893 --> 25:37.295
- What did you say to me?
- I said I don't care.

25:38.732 --> 25:40.165
Well, I forbid you to do this.

25:40.200 --> 25:42.167
Excuse me?

25:43.841 --> 25:45.741
Donna, I don't think you get it.

25:45.777 --> 25:47.009
There is going to come a time

25:47.044 --> 25:48.477
where you're gonna have to choose

25:48.512 --> 25:51.263
between yourself and them,

25:51.264 --> 25:54.032
and I am not going to let
you throw your life away

25:54.067 --> 25:55.300
for either one of them.

25:55.336 --> 25:56.735
You know what, Louis?

25:56.770 --> 25:59.338
If they're gonna come for me,
they're gonna come for me.

25:59.373 --> 26:02.073
But until then, if Mike
and Harvey need my help,

26:02.108 --> 26:05.344
I'm gonna give it to them.

26:05.379 --> 26:07.111
And if you have a problem with that,

26:07.147 --> 26:08.947
you might as well fire me.

26:24.694 --> 26:26.827
Robert?

26:31.767 --> 26:36.003
When Rachel first told me she
didn't want to work for me,

26:36.038 --> 26:39.773
we fought all night.

26:39.809 --> 26:43.411
I didn't think any other
firm was good enough.

26:43.965 --> 26:46.465
And then she told me she
was gonna work for you,

26:46.500 --> 26:48.901
and that changed everything.

26:48.937 --> 26:51.337
A brilliant black woman,

26:51.372 --> 26:53.806
mentor for my baby girl,

26:53.842 --> 26:55.041
someone who could teach her

26:55.076 --> 26:56.675
what the world does to people like us...

26:56.711 --> 26:58.277
how to get down in the mud

26:58.312 --> 27:02.215
and still manage to keep her dignity.

27:05.769 --> 27:08.703
And look at what you taught her instead.

27:10.220 --> 27:12.459
Is that what you came here to tell me?

27:12.755 --> 27:15.756
I came here to tell you to fire Rachel,

27:15.792 --> 27:18.059
because she won't quit.

27:18.094 --> 27:20.594
And when they come at
him to turn on you,

27:20.630 --> 27:24.232
I don't want her within
1,000 miles of this place.

27:24.267 --> 27:26.034
I'm sorry, Robert.

27:26.069 --> 27:29.370
I can't do that.

27:29.406 --> 27:32.240
And you know why.

27:32.576 --> 27:34.142
I do...

27:38.249 --> 27:42.217
Because it makes him look guilty...

27:42.253 --> 27:43.619
which he already is.

27:43.654 --> 27:45.520
And when they ask me to help to get him

27:45.556 --> 27:47.589
to turn on you, I'm gonna
recommend that he does.

27:47.625 --> 27:49.258
You do what you need to do,

27:49.293 --> 27:51.360
and I'll do what I need
to do to save my firm.

27:51.395 --> 27:52.728
It doesn't matter what you do.

27:52.763 --> 27:54.863
Your firm is gonna
crumble all around you.

27:54.898 --> 27:57.599
- Is that a threat?
- I don't have to threaten you.

27:57.635 --> 27:59.868
I don't have to lift a finger,

27:59.903 --> 28:01.470
because people are gonna come at you

28:01.505 --> 28:04.439
from places you didn't
even know existed,

28:04.475 --> 28:07.776
and I'm gonna enjoy every second of it.

28:14.069 --> 28:15.670
Louis, if you wanted to see me,

28:15.706 --> 28:17.138
you didn't have to send me a message

28:17.173 --> 28:18.306
telling me to meet you here.

28:18.341 --> 28:19.775
I did that because I
have a foolproof plan

28:19.810 --> 28:21.376
to stop Jack before
he even gets started.

28:21.412 --> 28:23.645
- Well, let's hear it.
- Make me managing partner.

28:23.680 --> 28:25.647
- Come again?
- It's the perfect solution.

28:25.682 --> 28:27.516
I step in, target's off your back,

28:27.551 --> 28:29.951
and we're fine till this all blows over.

28:30.499 --> 28:32.366
I don't believe this.

28:32.402 --> 28:33.867
You want my goddamn job.

28:33.903 --> 28:35.369
What? It's not like that.

28:35.405 --> 28:37.471
No one thinks that I have
anything to do with Mike.

28:37.506 --> 28:38.973
My ethics are beyond reproach.

28:39.008 --> 28:41.042
I don't recall them
being beyond reproach

28:41.077 --> 28:43.544
when you used Mike's secret
to get your name on the wall.

28:43.579 --> 28:45.316
- Jessica, that...
- Louis.

28:45.317 --> 28:46.550
You are out for yourself,

28:46.585 --> 28:48.284
and I'm not going to stand for it.

28:48.320 --> 28:49.786
How the hell could you say that to me

28:49.822 --> 28:51.187
after you just told me to step up?

28:51.223 --> 28:52.489
You want to step up,

28:52.524 --> 28:55.459
then do what I goddamn told you
to do and don't come to me

28:55.494 --> 28:59.396
with some "I'm not part of this"
Mike Ross bullshit ever again.

29:13.889 --> 29:16.557
I was wondering how long
it was going to take you.

29:16.592 --> 29:18.758
- You heard?
- Everybody's heard.

29:18.794 --> 29:20.227
Scottie, I have something to ask you,

29:20.262 --> 29:22.162
and you're not gonna like what it is.

29:22.198 --> 29:25.165
I can't believe it. You
think I would do that?

29:25.201 --> 29:27.033
No, I know you'd never do that.

29:27.069 --> 29:28.268
Then what are you doing here?

29:28.304 --> 29:29.503
Mike thought it could be you,

29:29.538 --> 29:31.105
and I promised him I'd look
you in the eye and ask.

29:31.140 --> 29:32.739
Okay, so let me get this straight...

29:33.155 --> 29:35.189
I keep Mike's secret,
throw a case for you,

29:35.224 --> 29:36.824
and now you're here
taking orders from him

29:36.860 --> 29:38.025
because you don't trust me?

29:38.060 --> 29:40.761
I do trust you, and I told Mike I did.

29:42.198 --> 29:43.531
Which is why the real reason you're here

29:43.566 --> 29:45.500
is not to ask me if I handed him in,

29:45.535 --> 29:46.734
but to tell me to keep quiet.

29:46.769 --> 29:49.069
Not to tell you... to ask
you if you're going to.

29:49.105 --> 29:50.337
What is the difference?

29:50.373 --> 29:51.438
Scottie...

29:51.474 --> 29:54.384
Harvey, I am not in your life anymore.

29:54.585 --> 29:55.584
I mean, what makes you think

29:55.619 --> 29:56.985
that they're going to come to me?

29:57.020 --> 29:58.487
'Cause you know how this works.

29:58.522 --> 30:00.021
They're gonna dig into my personal life,

30:00.056 --> 30:01.656
and when they do,
they're gonna find you.

30:01.692 --> 30:04.192
And how many women like me are
you paying a visit to today?

30:04.227 --> 30:06.962
There are no women like
you, and you know that.

30:06.997 --> 30:08.530
What I know is, the last
time you came to me,

30:08.565 --> 30:11.666
I told you I never wanted to
hear Mike Ross's name again,

30:11.702 --> 30:14.002
and once again, here you are,
asking me to do something

30:14.037 --> 30:15.804
for the person that
destroyed our relationship.

30:15.839 --> 30:18.773
Scottie, I'm not here to argue with you.

30:19.310 --> 30:21.710
But you still want to know
what I'm going to do?

30:21.745 --> 30:23.578
I do.

30:23.614 --> 30:27.120
Well, I guess we're just gonna have
to find that out when they come.

30:39.349 --> 30:41.616
I need to talk to you.

30:41.651 --> 30:43.418
Look, we've already
discussed all there is

30:43.453 --> 30:44.719
to discuss about the wedding.

30:44.754 --> 30:46.821
I can't go, so unless you've quit...

30:46.856 --> 30:48.556
I was arrested.

30:48.591 --> 30:49.557
What?

30:49.592 --> 30:50.992
Two nights ago, in my office,

30:51.028 --> 30:53.961
two U.S. Marshals grabbed
me out of the blue.

30:54.513 --> 30:56.312
- I'm sorry.
- You can save your sorrys.

30:56.348 --> 30:58.114
I want to know if you're
the one who turned me in.

30:58.150 --> 30:59.349
What?

30:59.384 --> 31:01.018
Jesus Christ, I can't
believe you'd think that.

31:01.053 --> 31:02.352
Why wouldn't I?

31:02.387 --> 31:04.154
You've done it before, and
you also told Father Walker,

31:04.189 --> 31:05.856
and I still haven't heard
you say that it wasn't you.

31:05.891 --> 31:07.223
Well, it wasn't me.

31:07.259 --> 31:09.626
Going to Father Walker was about
making things right in my life.

31:09.662 --> 31:11.428
Yeah, well, I got a way you can
make things right with me.

31:11.463 --> 31:12.629
They're gonna come to you

31:12.665 --> 31:14.031
to put together a case against me,

31:14.066 --> 31:15.933
and I need to know
what you're gonna say.

31:15.968 --> 31:17.903
I don't know what I'm
gonna say, Michael.

31:17.904 --> 31:19.438
Do you want to write
down my answers for me

31:19.473 --> 31:20.772
like you used to before class?

31:20.807 --> 31:23.241
Yeah, I do. And this time,
the answer's gonna be,

31:23.277 --> 31:25.477
- "I need to speak to my lawyer."
- Wow.

31:25.512 --> 31:28.012
20 years of friendship all
comes down to "lawyer up"?

31:28.048 --> 31:29.814
Yeah, it does, and you owe me, Trevor.

31:29.849 --> 31:31.116
I can't lie for you, Mike.

31:31.151 --> 31:32.417
I'm not asking you to lie for me.

31:32.453 --> 31:33.685
I'm asking you to pay me back

31:33.720 --> 31:36.321
for every time in my life
you have screwed me over.

31:38.825 --> 31:40.358
Okay.

31:40.756 --> 31:42.522
But I'm not doing this
to make it up to you.

31:42.558 --> 31:44.223
I'm doing this to make sure my family

31:44.259 --> 31:45.725
doesn't get dragged into this.

31:45.761 --> 31:47.627
So don't bother me with this again,

31:47.663 --> 31:50.063
or I may just have to tell
them everything I know.

32:05.798 --> 32:06.897
I see you can dish it out.

32:06.933 --> 32:08.399
The question is, can you take a punch?

32:08.435 --> 32:09.667
Why don't you put the gloves on?

32:09.702 --> 32:10.835
We can find out.

32:10.870 --> 32:12.370
I don't know if you've noticed,

32:12.405 --> 32:14.339
but we're already in the ring,
and you're not in my class.

32:14.374 --> 32:15.440
What are you doing here?

32:15.475 --> 32:16.707
I just wanted to look you in the eye

32:16.743 --> 32:19.477
and ask if you still work
at Pearson Specter Litt.

32:19.513 --> 32:20.778
Excuse me?

32:20.813 --> 32:22.614
I stopped by your office
to see if you were serious

32:22.649 --> 32:24.649
about pleading this thing
out, and you weren't there.

32:24.684 --> 32:26.284
So I asked your secretary
when you'd be coming back,

32:26.319 --> 32:27.985
and she got very cagey.

32:28.021 --> 32:31.122
And now I find you here, boxing
in the middle of the day.

32:31.548 --> 32:32.947
I'm blowing off steam.

32:32.982 --> 32:34.314
I don't think so.

32:34.350 --> 32:37.852
I think I was wrong
about you and Mr. Ross

32:37.887 --> 32:39.954
fabricating a letter of resignation.

32:39.989 --> 32:41.589
And I think Jessica Pearson

32:41.624 --> 32:43.290
found out what you two were up to,

32:43.325 --> 32:45.225
and rather than making
herself look like a fool

32:45.261 --> 32:46.493
by handing you in,

32:46.529 --> 32:48.462
she forced you both to resign.

32:48.497 --> 32:50.064
And now you're on your own.

32:50.099 --> 32:51.432
And I think if you
want to write fiction,

32:51.467 --> 32:54.401
I hear they got a remedial class at NYU.

32:54.925 --> 32:56.891
Maybe I'm wrong.

32:56.927 --> 33:00.262
Maybe Jessica knew about
Mike Ross all along,

33:00.297 --> 33:04.232
in which case, maybe
you would turn on her.

33:04.268 --> 33:06.593
Why don't you get the hell out
of here before I turn on you?

33:06.836 --> 33:07.902
I will.

33:07.938 --> 33:09.904
But if I find out you resigned,

33:09.940 --> 33:11.773
that's evidence you're a co-conspirator.

33:11.808 --> 33:13.875
And I'll not only get you off this case.

33:13.910 --> 33:17.512
I'll put you behind bars
along with your little pet.

33:30.028 --> 33:31.027
What the hell is this?

33:31.062 --> 33:32.729
You know what it is. It's formal notice.

33:32.765 --> 33:34.364
Your services are no longer required.

33:34.400 --> 33:35.799
I don't believe this.

33:35.834 --> 33:37.534
You're firing me? Yes, I am.

33:37.569 --> 33:38.902
And I want you to pack
your things up tonight,

33:38.937 --> 33:41.171
because you and I don't see eye
to eye on your priorities.

33:41.206 --> 33:42.872
Okay, Louis...

33:42.908 --> 33:44.174
just because we had a fight...

33:44.209 --> 33:46.335
No, this has nothing to do with that.

33:46.336 --> 33:47.803
So you're saying that
this has nothing to do

33:47.838 --> 33:48.937
with you lashing out at me

33:48.973 --> 33:50.338
because of the fight we had before?

33:50.374 --> 33:52.474
No, it doesn't, because
among other things,

33:52.509 --> 33:54.509
you set your own hours,
you can't take dictation,

33:54.545 --> 33:57.680
and to top all that, you
can't read people for shit!

34:00.151 --> 34:01.984
What's going on?

34:05.656 --> 34:09.257
You almost went to jail for
helping them once before,

34:09.292 --> 34:11.426
and I couldn't take that.

34:12.829 --> 34:16.063
And the thought of
losing you once again...

34:16.424 --> 34:19.092
So you know that they need my help.

34:19.127 --> 34:20.393
Yeah.

34:20.428 --> 34:22.695
I do.

34:22.730 --> 34:25.098
Now you're free to go.

34:26.105 --> 34:28.272
What made you change your mind?

34:27.306 --> 34:29.908
Jessica accused me of not
being a team player.

34:29.943 --> 34:33.811
And she was wrong about me, and...

34:33.847 --> 34:35.947
I was wrong about you.

34:37.251 --> 34:39.751
Thank you, Louis.

34:41.355 --> 34:42.353
I have to go.

34:42.389 --> 34:45.656
No, Louis.

34:45.692 --> 34:47.259
You don't.

35:05.750 --> 35:06.815
What are you doing here?

35:06.851 --> 35:08.884
Our conversation got cut
short the other night.

35:08.919 --> 35:10.553
So Anita Gibbs sent you here to tell me

35:10.588 --> 35:13.188
that if I go to prison, I'm
not gonna come out the same.

35:13.224 --> 35:14.457
You're right. She did.

35:14.492 --> 35:16.659
She wanted me to come here and
scare the shit out of you,

35:16.694 --> 35:17.727
tell you about everything

35:17.762 --> 35:19.262
that's gonna be happening to you inside.

35:19.297 --> 35:20.863
And who says I'm ever gonna be inside?

35:20.898 --> 35:22.265
Maybe you won't.

35:22.300 --> 35:24.233
But if you do, I'm here to tell you

35:24.269 --> 35:26.034
everything that's gonna
happen on the outside.

35:26.070 --> 35:27.536
Why don't you get the hell out of here?

35:27.572 --> 35:29.838
Listen to me. Anita's going
to come to you with a deal,

35:29.874 --> 35:31.607
and it's not gonna be
through Harvey Specter.

35:31.643 --> 35:33.175
And if you're smart, you'll take it.

35:33.210 --> 35:34.610
I said get the hell out.

35:34.646 --> 35:37.251
All right, I'll go. Just
let me tell you something.

35:37.252 --> 35:39.852
They don't have conjugal
visits in federal prison.

35:39.888 --> 35:42.755
And even if they did,
I've seen your fiancÃ©e.

35:42.791 --> 35:45.292
She's smart. She's beautiful.

35:45.327 --> 35:46.927
She has a future.

35:46.962 --> 35:48.528
Girls like that don't wait around,

35:48.563 --> 35:50.630
no matter what they say.

36:03.466 --> 36:05.934
Hey.

36:05.969 --> 36:08.269
Hey.

36:08.305 --> 36:10.338
- There's...
- I wanted to talk...

36:10.373 --> 36:14.042
Sorry. You go first.

36:14.077 --> 36:17.178
My father was here.

36:17.214 --> 36:20.681
That woman went to him
and offered a deal.

36:20.717 --> 36:22.783
Let me guess...

36:22.819 --> 36:25.019
they want me to turn on Harvey.

36:25.055 --> 36:26.354
They'll drop all the charges,

36:26.389 --> 36:29.749
and you won't have to
spend a minute in prison.

36:29.750 --> 36:31.016
What did you tell him?

36:31.052 --> 36:34.119
I told him that I would
give you the message.

36:34.843 --> 36:39.112
That you'd give me the message?

36:39.147 --> 36:41.348
Rachel, you know there's no way in hell

36:41.383 --> 36:43.083
I am ever gonna turn on them, right?

36:43.118 --> 36:44.517
- You know that.
- Yes, I do.

36:44.552 --> 36:46.086
- Do you?
- What's that supposed to mean?

36:46.121 --> 36:47.220
It means that you should have told him

36:47.256 --> 36:48.554
that I'm loyal to everyone in my life,

36:48.590 --> 36:50.090
and I would rather go to
jail than betray them.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.424
I did tell him that.

36:51.459 --> 36:53.059
So then why didn't you tell
me that you told him that?

36:53.095 --> 36:54.594
Because that's not what you asked me.

36:54.629 --> 36:56.329
Tell me right now that the
idea never crossed your mind

36:56.365 --> 36:57.497
that I should take this deal.

36:57.532 --> 36:59.766
Of course it popped into
my head for a second...

36:59.801 --> 37:01.368
So you think that I
should just turn on them

37:01.403 --> 37:02.802
the second things look bad?

37:02.837 --> 37:04.271
That is not what I said.

37:04.306 --> 37:07.259
Is that what you're
thinking of doing to me?

37:07.260 --> 37:08.894
How could you even ask me that?

37:08.929 --> 37:10.462
I never even thought for a second

37:10.497 --> 37:13.298
that you would even consider
an idea so disgusting

37:13.333 --> 37:14.299
as turning on Harvey.

37:14.334 --> 37:15.667
The only reason I thought about it

37:15.702 --> 37:17.836
is because I am scared to death

37:17.871 --> 37:19.037
of you going to prison.

37:19.072 --> 37:20.171
Scared of me going to prison

37:20.206 --> 37:21.973
or scared that you can't stick around?

37:22.008 --> 37:23.442
Are you...?

37:26.093 --> 37:27.326
Mike, don't.

37:27.361 --> 37:29.929
We need to talk.

37:32.431 --> 37:34.865
We got a problem.

37:34.900 --> 37:36.900
Yeah, we do...

37:36.935 --> 37:38.535
'cause it wasn't Trevor.

37:38.571 --> 37:40.871
It wasn't Scottie either,
but that's not our problem.

37:40.906 --> 37:43.507
Gibbs came to see me earlier. She
knows I'm not in the office.

37:43.542 --> 37:44.742
What does that mean?

37:44.777 --> 37:46.610
It means she's gonna try
to use it as evidence

37:46.646 --> 37:48.211
of Harvey being a co-conspirator,

37:48.247 --> 37:51.248
and if she does that,
Harvey can't represent me.

37:56.904 --> 37:59.605
What's going on?

37:59.640 --> 38:01.674
They offered Mike a deal.

38:01.709 --> 38:03.509
They want him to turn on you.

38:04.545 --> 38:06.045
Then you're in good company,

38:06.081 --> 38:07.880
'cause they offered me a
deal to turn on Jessica,

38:07.915 --> 38:09.415
but that's not our problem.

38:09.451 --> 38:11.384
Our problem is figuring
out how to get me back

38:11.419 --> 38:13.886
without Forstman finding out.

38:14.506 --> 38:17.608
Wait a second.

38:17.643 --> 38:20.277
It doesn't matter if
Forstman finds out or not

38:20.312 --> 38:22.846
if he doesn't have someone on
the inside working for him.

38:22.882 --> 38:23.847
What are you saying?

38:23.883 --> 38:25.082
I'm saying that if they want me

38:25.117 --> 38:26.316
to point the finger at someone,

38:26.351 --> 38:28.185
that means I'm holding a gun.

38:37.230 --> 38:39.797
It's still alive.

38:41.334 --> 38:43.034
Did you think I would let it die?

38:43.069 --> 38:45.602
No, but I thought you
might give it away.

38:45.638 --> 38:48.645
Well, I'm more sentimental
than you think.

38:48.646 --> 38:49.645
How'd you get in here?

38:49.680 --> 38:50.847
Jessica told me how

38:50.882 --> 38:52.681
when I told her what I
was coming here to do.

38:52.717 --> 38:53.783
And what is that?

38:53.818 --> 38:56.219
You need me...

38:56.254 --> 38:58.387
because as good as Gretchen is,
she can't be a part of this,

38:58.422 --> 39:00.489
and you know it.

39:00.524 --> 39:03.492
You're saying you're coming back to me?

39:03.527 --> 39:06.662
Yes.

39:06.697 --> 39:09.632
I am.

39:10.279 --> 39:12.012
Good.

39:13.025 --> 39:15.326
Good.

39:18.096 --> 39:21.498
Then we'll see you back
in the office tomorrow.

39:21.534 --> 39:24.067
- What do you mean?
- I mean I'm coming back.

39:24.102 --> 39:25.436
How did you swing that?

39:25.471 --> 39:29.103
Hasn't happened yet, but I got a
little secret weapon called Mike Ross.

39:29.608 --> 39:32.576
Well, then...

39:34.208 --> 39:36.675
See you tomorrow.

39:39.087 --> 39:41.553
Donna?

39:43.024 --> 39:44.590
How did Louis take it?

39:44.625 --> 39:47.326
Believe it or not, it was his idea.

39:57.775 --> 39:59.508
Surprised to see me?

39:59.543 --> 40:01.177
As a matter of fact, I am,

40:01.212 --> 40:03.946
but as long as you're here,
I have a question for you.

40:05.216 --> 40:07.149
You want to know if it's true.

40:07.185 --> 40:08.450
Oh, I know it's true.

40:08.485 --> 40:10.019
I want to know why you haven't tried

40:10.054 --> 40:11.386
to deal your way out of this.

40:11.422 --> 40:13.522
You mean why haven't I turned
on Harvey and Jessica?

40:13.557 --> 40:14.957
That's exactly what I mean.

40:14.992 --> 40:16.525
It wouldn't have anything to do

40:16.560 --> 40:18.194
with you wanting to use all of this

40:18.229 --> 40:19.995
just to get your name
on the door, would it?

40:20.031 --> 40:21.263
Oh, I'm getting my name on the door

40:21.299 --> 40:22.631
whether you cut a deal or not.

40:22.666 --> 40:24.700
Well, if you don't stop coming
after Harvey and Jessica,

40:24.735 --> 40:26.068
the only door you're gonna be looking at

40:26.103 --> 40:27.136
is gonna have bars on it.

40:27.171 --> 40:28.537
What the hell are you talking about?

40:28.572 --> 40:29.705
Let me tell you

40:29.740 --> 40:31.373
what I just got finished
telling Daniel Hardman.

40:31.408 --> 40:33.108
They're coming at me left and right

40:33.144 --> 40:35.144
to admit that someone around here knew

40:35.179 --> 40:38.313
what was going on with
me the whole time.

40:38.314 --> 40:40.147
So, if you don't back off

40:40.182 --> 40:42.416
trying to take over this
firm once and for all,

40:42.451 --> 40:44.485
I'm gonna tell them
that someone was you.

40:44.520 --> 40:45.653
Bullshit.

40:45.688 --> 40:47.688
You didn't even know me
until a few months ago.

40:47.724 --> 40:49.490
Well, yeah, but then you
and I worked together

40:49.525 --> 40:51.291
so closely on that case.

40:51.327 --> 40:53.460
And then I confided in you.

40:53.496 --> 40:57.464
And then you made me partner

40:57.500 --> 41:00.101
so that you would always have an ally.

41:00.136 --> 41:02.302
There's no way that holds up in court.

41:02.338 --> 41:03.671
Good luck telling that to the judge.

41:04.178 --> 41:05.444
And this prosecutor...

41:05.927 --> 41:08.727
She... she's a real beast.

41:08.763 --> 41:10.922
She's gonna come after you
with everything she has.

41:11.914 --> 41:14.315
I never did anything to you.

41:14.351 --> 41:16.417
And I'm not leaving my firm.

41:16.453 --> 41:19.620
I don't give a shit whether
you stay or you go.

41:19.655 --> 41:21.922
But Harvey is coming back
here tomorrow morning,

41:21.958 --> 41:24.592
and if you pick up that phone
and call Charles Forstman,

41:24.627 --> 41:26.160
then I am gonna pick up the phone

41:26.196 --> 41:29.197
and tell that prosecutor
all about me and you.

41:38.641 --> 41:41.575
I always wondered what
it was like in here.

41:41.611 --> 41:43.478
It's nicer than I thought.

41:43.513 --> 41:44.945
Jessica, how'd you find me here?

41:44.981 --> 41:46.947
You always go mudding when you're upset.

41:46.983 --> 41:49.417
I always go to the gun
range and the ballet.

41:49.452 --> 41:52.053
You go to the range when you're angry,

41:52.088 --> 41:53.554
the ballet when you're depressed,

41:53.589 --> 41:54.955
but mud...

41:54.991 --> 41:56.524
Heals the broken heart.

41:56.559 --> 41:57.691
I know.

41:57.727 --> 41:59.527
And I heard about what
you did with Donna.

41:59.562 --> 42:03.197
And I'm here to say I'm sorry.

42:03.233 --> 42:06.567
You weren't just out for yourself.

42:06.602 --> 42:08.202
But I was out for myself, Jessica.

42:08.238 --> 42:09.404
Donna showed me that.

42:09.439 --> 42:11.039
Are you saying you were after my job?

42:11.074 --> 42:12.106
Of course I wasn't.

42:12.142 --> 42:13.441
But who the hell am I kidding, you know?

42:13.476 --> 42:15.709
I mean, I'm not Frodo.

42:15.745 --> 42:16.977
Once I got that ring of power,

42:17.013 --> 42:19.680
we all know it would've consumed me.

42:19.715 --> 42:21.782
That's what I like about you, Louis.

42:21.817 --> 42:23.017
You may not be self-aware,

42:23.053 --> 42:25.186
but if someone holds up a mirror,

42:25.221 --> 42:27.288
you are not afraid to look.

42:28.724 --> 42:32.093
Thank you, Jessica.

42:32.128 --> 42:34.128
And the truth is,

42:34.164 --> 42:35.796
Harvey needs Donna more than I do.

42:35.831 --> 42:37.932
Well, it was a selfless and noble act.

42:37.967 --> 42:40.034
And as far as I'm concerned,
you may not be Frodo,

42:40.070 --> 42:41.835
but you are Samwise Gamgee.

42:41.871 --> 42:43.737
Get the f... You read
"Lord of the Rings"?

42:43.773 --> 42:44.738
Four times.

42:44.774 --> 42:46.740
I mean, it is about power.

42:46.776 --> 42:48.642
That's funny.

42:48.678 --> 42:51.679
I always thought it
was about friendship.

42:51.714 --> 42:54.248
Good night, Louis.

42:54.284 --> 42:56.917
You sure you don't want
to have a quick mud?

42:56.953 --> 42:58.519
Maybe next time.

42:58.555 --> 43:00.588
- Really?
- No.

43:09.632 --> 43:11.699
How'd it go?

43:11.734 --> 43:15.203
Let's just say Jack Soloff's not
gonna be a problem anymore.

43:15.238 --> 43:16.904
That's one thing down.

43:16.939 --> 43:20.341
Yeah, it is.

43:20.376 --> 43:23.444
- Look, Rachel...
- I'm not gonna leave you.

43:26.349 --> 43:28.249
How can you know that?

43:28.284 --> 43:30.851
All I can tell you is that we've managed

43:30.886 --> 43:33.421
to stay together with this
thing hanging over our heads

43:33.456 --> 43:37.492
for as long as we've known each other.

43:37.527 --> 43:41.529
And if we can get through that,
we can get through this.

43:44.100 --> 43:47.034
But I still might go to jail.

43:47.069 --> 43:51.705
And if you do, you'll get out...

43:51.741 --> 43:54.175
and I'll be there.

43:54.210 --> 43:58.613
And it won't be hanging
over our heads...

43:58.648 --> 44:00.948
ever again.
