04:37.216 --> 04:40.445

is a brilliant thing</i>

04:40.513 --> 04:41.976
<i>that you have going on

<i>And we should develop it
in this great, insane way.</i>

04:45.644 --> 04:49.062
He... he spoke the words
of a song that he wrote.

04:49.130 --> 04:50.616
<i>It's about what to do
when you're mad.</i>

04:50.684 --> 04:53.630
<i>He's like, "Well, what do
you do when you're mad?</i>

04:53.698 --> 04:55.400
<i>"You wanna punch a wall?</i>

04:55.759 --> 04:57.893
<i>"You wanna rip

05:28.734 --> 05:30.609
<i>You deserve this $20 million.</i>

05:30.718 --> 05:33.017

<i>So Rockefeller's going
through all of the Northeast,</i>

07:19.379 --> 07:22.658
<i>just buying out all these
small, little refineries</i>

07:22.726 --> 07:25.054
<i>until Franklin Tarbell's

<i>And Rockefeller's like, Mr. Tarbell,</i>

<i>I'm gonna make things

<i>But Franklin Tarbell,

<i>Excuse me.</i>

07:43.969 --> 07:47.226
There's gonna be plenty
more where that came from.

07:47.713 --> 07:50.632
Rockefeller's going to
all these railroad owners

07:50.709 --> 07:53.116
saying like, hey, man,
if you charge me less

07:53.193 --> 07:55.704
<i>for more oil... which
I could bring you...</i>

07:55.781 --> 07:58.265
<i>all these little dudes are

07:58.382 --> 08:00.956
<i>**** them over,
and in the long run,</i>

08:01.033 --> 08:03.867
<i>they sell to Uncle Rockefeller.</i>

08:04.132 --> 08:07.315
<i>He ends up owning 85% of the oil.</i>

08:07.392 --> 08:10.421
<i>This made Rockefeller
the richest man in the world.</i>

08:10.489 --> 08:13.070
<i>Franklin's like, ****in' Rockefeller.</i>

08:13.164 --> 08:15.356
<i>He boned us all.
We'll never eat again.</i>

08:15.433 --> 08:17.825
<i>My whole livelihood is

08:17.902 --> 08:20.257
Poor Ida is watching this

08:20.334 --> 08:21.456
And, like, if you're watching that,

<i>Well I know
what I need to do.</i>

08:31.330 --> 08:32.804
So...

08:34.131 --> 08:37.703
She's hired as a staff writer
for "McClure's Magazine"

08:37.859 --> 08:41.149
<i>and Mark... Mark Twain

08:41.226 --> 08:44.586
<i>And Mark is like, look, I
think what you do is great.</i>

08:44.663 --> 08:46.110
<i>And she's like oh, thank you.</i>

08:46.187 --> 08:49.010
<i>She's like... I... I wanna do

08:49.078 --> 08:51.369

09:02.548 --> 09:04.468
<i>And she's like,
I'd love to talk to him.</i>

09:04.536 --> 09:07.125
<i>He is high up at Standard Oil.</i>

09:07.193 --> 09:08.562
<i>And...</i>

09:08.833 --> 09:11.132
Uh, Franklin Ro...

09:11.355 --> 09:12.393
Wait, hold on.

09:12.493 --> 09:14.195
<i>So Rockefeller...</i>

09:14.263 --> 09:15.783
All right, hold on.
I'll back this up.

09:15.851 --> 09:17.460
I'll get this information out.

09:17.629 --> 09:19.892
Now I'm really starting
to feel wasted.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.720
<i>Mission accomplished,
everyone.</i>

09:24.802 --> 09:27.404
So Mark Twain is like...

09:27.489 --> 09:30.499
he's setting Ida Tarbell
up with an interview.

09:30.576 --> 09:32.748
<i>Oh, hey,
what are you doing, huh?</i>

09:32.825 --> 09:35.504
<i>Blah, blah, blah. And
Rogers is thinking,</i>

09:35.581 --> 09:37.003
<i>a woman is speaking to me.</i>

09:37.080 --> 09:39.700
<i>Even if her job is to
currently speak to me</i>

09:39.779 --> 09:41.507
<i>in this moment,
I'm still gonna</i>

09:41.575 --> 09:43.406
<i>misread this as attraction.</i>

09:43.474 --> 09:45.101
<i>Let me put on
the pussy show.</i>

09:45.169 --> 09:48.281
And then he starts
over-revealing information.

09:48.349 --> 09:50.021
And he... he's telling her,

09:50.154 --> 09:53.068
uh, oh, hey, take a
look at these documents.

09:53.169 --> 09:54.864
<i>Yeah, look at this,
huh? Isn't this cool?</i>

09:54.932 --> 09:56.860
<i>Look at all the kinda cool
stuff we're doing at Rockefe...</i>

09:56.927 --> 09:59.146
<i>Yeah, this is going on.
Hey, yeah, uh,</i>

09:59.372 --> 10:01.755
<i>exclusive information
that not everyone has.</i>

10:01.840 --> 10:02.979
<i>Oh, you wanna take a look?</i>

10:03.056 --> 10:04.477
<i>Yeah, you can look at
court documents.</i>

10:04.544 --> 10:06.906
<i>Take a look at this.
And then Ida's going,</i>

10:06.983 --> 10:08.703
<i>you know, nice try,
shithead.</i>

10:08.780 --> 10:10.652
<i>You're dead, you're dead,
you're dead.</i>

10:10.841 --> 10:12.977
<i>Now we're in... Now we're in, uh...</i>

10:13.054 --> 10:15.078
Ida Tarbell's montage moment.

10:15.146 --> 10:16.635
<i>You know,
she spends the next two years</i>

10:16.702 --> 10:19.007
<i>organizing court...
court documents,</i>

10:19.075 --> 10:20.748
<i>research, interviews, this...</i>

10:20.825 --> 10:22.564
<i>anything she can get her hands on</i>

10:22.641 --> 10:24.232
<i>to start building a narrative.</i>

10:24.435 --> 10:27.406
Ida got down behind
her **** typewriter

10:27.474 --> 10:29.099
at that moment, it was
just...

10:29.204 --> 10:31.578
<i>Yes, uh, ohh</i>

10:33.667 --> 10:35.788
<i>Rockefeller is a...</i>

10:36.566 --> 10:38.364
<i>A money monster.</i>

10:38.772 --> 10:40.286
<i>A hypocrite.</i>

10:40.379 --> 10:44.974
<i>Rockefeller is a L-I-V-I-N-G M-U-M-M-Y</i>

10:45.113 --> 10:48.707
<i>AKA, Rockefeller is a living mummy.</i>

10:48.824 --> 10:52.512
<i>A-K-L-I-I-V-G-N-Y... la, la, la.</i>

10:52.638 --> 10:56.694
<i>So she ends up publishing
a 19-piece article</i>

10:56.796 --> 10:58.405
<i>called "The History of Standard Oil."</i>

10:58.473 --> 11:00.631
<i>People are reading this going,
like, has anyone caught</i>

11:00.699 --> 11:03.389
<i>that McClure's thing about
that J. D. Rockefeller dude</i>

11:03.457 --> 11:05.345
<i>we were all worshipping for
so long?</i>

11:05.454 --> 11:08.179
<i>Turns out,
might be a bit of a scumbag.</i>

11:08.264 --> 11:10.011
<i>Upon further investigation,</i>

11:10.088 --> 11:13.249
<i>I think
this dude is bad news.</i>

11:13.404 --> 11:15.436
<i>He's a bad hombre.</i>

11:15.546 --> 11:18.546
Her little article...
little article...

11:18.614 --> 11:21.065
well... that's the most
misogynistic thing you can do

11:21.133 --> 11:23.671
is call a woman's article
a little article.

11:24.366 --> 11:26.236
<i>No, she writes a **** article</i>

11:26.304 --> 11:28.454
<i>that
President Teddy Roosevelt reads</i>

11:28.522 --> 11:30.710
<i>and he's like, has any
one else been reading</i>

11:30.778 --> 11:32.507
<i>this Ida Tarbell series?</i>

11:32.631 --> 11:34.936
<i>This **** Rockefeller
guy is **** me</i>

11:35.004 --> 11:36.009
<i>with his monopoly.</i>

11:36.077 --> 11:37.234
<i>Guys, I've been
working on this thing</i>

11:37.301 --> 11:39.974
<i>called, like,
the Sherman Antitrust Act.</i>

11:40.137 --> 11:42.655
<i>Feel like it might work
in this situation.</i>

11:42.831 --> 11:45.457
<i>Teddy, you bring up a
couple of valid points.</i>

11:45.686 --> 11:47.583
<i>We could do something
about this.</i>

11:47.660 --> 11:50.839
<i>So in 1911,
the Supreme Court</i>

11:50.916 --> 11:54.843
<i>says that the monopoly of
Standard Oil is illegal</i>

11:54.920 --> 11:58.127
<i>and you must break down
into two companies.</i>

11:58.404 --> 12:03.408
So a woman
who was unable to even vote

12:03.661 --> 12:06.596
<i>was able, via just writing</i>

12:06.670 --> 12:11.486
<i>to take down
the richest man in the world...</i>

12:11.924 --> 12:14.322
<i>Man, that is so cool.</i>

12:14.670 --> 12:17.924
They **** shut
Standard Oil down.

12:18.010 --> 12:20.902
Well...
they let Standard Oil turn into

12:20.979 --> 12:25.121
two small, bullshit companies
who would never make any money

12:25.213 --> 12:29.791
Called Exxon Mobile and Chevron.

12:30.121 --> 12:32.947
Two companies
that didn't do anything.

12:33.024 --> 12:37.603
So looks like journalism
wins in the long run again.

12:40.327 --> 12:41.779
<i>- Ready?
- Okay.</i>

12:43.351 --> 12:45.814
Hi, I'm Jennie Pierson.

12:48.702 --> 12:49.822
Okay.

12:52.410 --> 12:54.583
Hi, I'm Jennie Pierson
and today,

12:54.660 --> 12:56.830
we'll be talking about... today?

13:02.503 --> 13:05.209
Hi, I'm Jennie Pierson and today,

13:05.310 --> 13:07.939
we're talking about Maya Lin.

13:09.298 --> 13:10.408
Cheers.

13:11.830 --> 13:13.683
<i>So it's 1980</i>

13:13.815 --> 13:17.088
<i>and the people at the
Vietnam War Memorial Fund</i>

13:17.156 --> 13:21.111
<i>are like, I got an idea,
let's have a competition</i>

13:21.314 --> 13:25.281
<i>to see who can design the
best Vietnam War Memorial.</i>

13:26.119 --> 13:27.145
<i>Sorry.</i>

13:27.213 --> 13:28.213
<i>You're okay.</i>

13:28.281 --> 13:29.337
<i>So they get</i>

13:29.414 --> 13:32.240
<i>1,500 submissions
to this contest.</i>

13:32.317 --> 13:33.399
<i>They're walking by,
they're like,</i>

13:33.466 --> 13:35.939
<i>that one's too tall.</i>

13:36.110 --> 13:39.383
<i>I think this one is a
little too political,</i>

13:39.538 --> 13:40.955
<i>thank you very much.</i>

13:41.023 --> 13:44.769
<i>And this one
is too disgusting.</i>

13:45.026 --> 13:46.530
<i>Then they...
they walk up to one,</i>

13:46.678 --> 13:50.174
<i>wow, this is **** beautiful.</i>

13:50.468 --> 13:53.361
<i>Right, guys? Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

13:53.438 --> 13:55.262
<i>We're...
we get this. We love it.</i>

13:55.339 --> 13:56.745
<i>We love it.
Let's... this one.</i>

13:56.822 --> 13:58.747
<i>This is it!
This is the one!</i>

13:58.885 --> 14:00.666
<i>We love this one!</i>

14:00.833 --> 14:02.681
<i>Whose is it?
Reveal the winner.</i>

14:02.794 --> 14:05.603
<i>And they're like, okay,
are you ready for this?</i>

14:05.798 --> 14:10.174
<i>It is a 20-year-old college
student named Maya Lin.</i>

14:10.355 --> 14:13.095
<i>And they're like, what?
It's just a college student?</i>

14:13.163 --> 14:15.095
<i>That's crazy.</i>

14:15.287 --> 14:17.845
<i>Cut to Yale
and Maya Lin</i>

14:17.913 --> 14:19.931
<i>is sitting in her
architecture class.</i>

14:20.102 --> 14:22.619
<i>And they're like, sorry
to interrupt your class,</i>

14:22.767 --> 14:24.234
<i>but is Maya Lin here?</i>

14:24.324 --> 14:26.149
<i>We have something
to tell her.</i>

14:26.314 --> 14:28.044
<i>And he's like, whatever, fine.</i>

14:28.121 --> 14:33.632
<i>Maya!</i>

14:33.842 --> 14:35.111
<i>Maya!</i>

14:36.080 --> 14:38.424
<i>And she's like, huh?
I... I'm over here.</i>

14:38.623 --> 14:39.623
Uhh!

14:42.637 --> 14:45.199
<i>And they're like,
you won the contest</i>

14:45.267 --> 14:47.510
<i>for the Vietnam War Memorial.</i>

14:47.603 --> 14:51.174
<i>We're making
your sculpture.</i>

14:51.242 --> 14:53.767
<i>Can you imagine?</i>

14:54.333 --> 14:57.240
Um... and Maya was
just like, guess what?

14:57.308 --> 14:59.185
<i>I won. I won!</i>

14:59.271 --> 15:01.442
<i>I guess I'm drunker right
now than I thought I'd be.</i>

15:01.510 --> 15:03.330
- I'm sorry.
- <i>You're... don't be sorry.</i>

15:03.398 --> 15:04.403
- Okay.
- <i>You're doing so good.</i>

15:04.470 --> 15:06.514
I thought I would be
more normal at this point.

15:06.591 --> 15:08.345
- <i>You're fine.</i>
- Okay.

15:08.479 --> 15:11.197
So
All of these war veterans are saying

15:11.265 --> 15:15.877
<i>this memorial has
no military symbolism,</i>

15:15.945 --> 15:19.025
<i>there's no weaponry,
we don't get it.</i>

15:19.093 --> 15:21.017
<i>It's a black gash of shame.</i>

15:21.085 --> 15:24.064
<i>And we are not
on board with this.</i>

15:24.219 --> 15:29.200
Ross Perot,
he was gonna donate $160,000

15:29.324 --> 15:31.197
to the building of this memorial.

15:31.265 --> 15:34.392
<i>He walks up to them
and he's like, hold on.</i>

15:34.560 --> 15:37.619
<i>This is a woman?
And she's Asian?</i>

15:37.842 --> 15:40.103
<i>She's a young, Asian woman?</i>

15:40.170 --> 15:43.544
<i>I'm not gonna give you any
money to build this thing</i>

15:43.661 --> 15:46.916
<i>if you don't stop...</i>

15:47.182 --> 15:49.865
<i>I don't know...</i>

15:50.080 --> 15:53.760
<i>Hold on.
You better pick someone else.</i>

15:53.845 --> 15:56.650
<i>I'm pissed, I'm pissed,
I'm pissed.</i>

15:56.727 --> 15:59.470
<i>I'm running for
president in 12 years.</i>

15:59.538 --> 16:02.447
<i>**** you guys.
I'm pulling my funding.</i>

16:02.597 --> 16:05.158
<i>The committee
that had chosen her,</i>

16:05.328 --> 16:07.947
<i>they heard all of the...
this backlash.</i>

16:08.015 --> 16:09.734
<i>And they went to Maya
and they were like,</i>

16:09.846 --> 16:13.361
<i>okay, so listen,
a lot of people are pissed off.</i>

16:13.458 --> 16:15.969
<i>We have
a couple of compromises.</i>

16:16.108 --> 16:20.416
<i>We'd... we'd like to put more
military symbolism into it.</i>

16:20.549 --> 16:23.595
<i>We'd... we'd like to have
a bronze... a bronze statue</i>

16:23.663 --> 16:27.189
<i>of a solider carrying an American flag</i>

16:27.435 --> 16:31.002
<i>um, placed
in the center of your...</i>

16:31.129 --> 16:32.701
<i>of your memorial.</i>

16:32.911 --> 16:35.345
Uh, and then also,

16:35.666 --> 16:39.494
<i>what if we paint
the black marble white?</i>

16:39.718 --> 16:41.447
<i>How does that sound?</i>

16:42.822 --> 16:46.470
And Maya is like,
hell no.

16:46.710 --> 16:50.095
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

16:50.315 --> 16:52.049
<i>Not in a million years.</i>

16:52.324 --> 16:54.447
<i>And they were like, ****.</i>

16:54.943 --> 16:57.689
<i>All right, you know what?</i>

16:58.132 --> 17:01.359
<i>Let's bring it to Congress, bitch.</i>

17:01.585 --> 17:04.276
<i>We're bringing it to
Co... no, that's dumb.</i>

17:11.702 --> 17:14.271
Um, okay.

17:14.368 --> 17:15.741
What do I wanna say next?

17:15.809 --> 17:16.858
Okay.

17:16.928 --> 17:18.771
<i>So at this
Congressional hearing,</i>

17:18.839 --> 17:22.881
<i>politicians, veterans...
all testifying against her.</i>

17:23.016 --> 17:25.521
<i>I don't like that
it's the color black!</i>

17:25.645 --> 17:28.537
<i>I don't like that
it's abstract!</i>

17:28.918 --> 17:30.580
<i>I don't get it!</i>

17:30.648 --> 17:32.733
<i>What is minimalism?</i>

17:32.924 --> 17:35.733
<i>I don't like that
it looks like a pee sign...</i>

17:35.801 --> 17:37.381
<i>a pee sign?</i>

17:38.918 --> 17:41.803
<i>I don't like that this
looks like a peace sign</i>

17:41.871 --> 17:44.529
<i>because those damn
hippies are always</i>

17:44.601 --> 17:46.811
<i>flashing a peace sign at me</i>

17:46.886 --> 17:48.597
<i>and I don't like it!</i>

17:48.674 --> 17:49.998
<i>The chairman is like,
all right,</i>

17:50.066 --> 17:51.764
<i>we've heard all this
shitty stuff.</i>

17:52.129 --> 17:54.520
<i>Maya,
you wanna come up here?</i>

17:54.588 --> 17:56.162
<i>Maya gets up there</i>

17:56.237 --> 17:59.050
<i>and she's like, okay, guys,</i>

17:59.252 --> 18:03.026
<i>this memorial should
rise up out of the earth</i>

18:03.111 --> 18:06.084
<i>like a wound
that can be healed.</i>

18:06.221 --> 18:08.850
<i>This is supposed to
feel personal</i>

18:08.939 --> 18:13.319
<i>so families and friends
of people who have died</i>

18:13.387 --> 18:18.835
<i>can come to the memorial
and feel the loss</i>

18:18.998 --> 18:22.202
<i>of their loved ones
as if it was a gravesite.</i>

18:22.374 --> 18:23.780
<i>It's not a political statement.</i>

18:23.848 --> 18:27.427
<i>It's just a sense of
togetherness and community.</i>

18:27.596 --> 18:30.967
And the chairman is like,
I get it.

18:31.035 --> 18:32.731
<i>I wanna feel sorrow, too.</i>

18:32.799 --> 18:35.327
<i>Everybody just wants
to feel something.</i>

18:35.492 --> 18:39.255
<i>And okay, we're gonna do it.
We're gonna do it.</i>

18:39.323 --> 18:40.662
<i>We're gonna do it.</i>

18:43.402 --> 18:44.975
♪♪

18:45.052 --> 18:48.465
<i>So... this-this memo...
this memorial goes up.</i>

18:48.533 --> 18:50.004
And when it went up,
there was, like,

18:50.071 --> 18:51.295
this big celebration for it.

18:51.363 --> 18:54.881
And 10,000 veterans marched
to the wall in commemoration.

18:54.975 --> 18:56.733
<i>But they were like, you know,</i>

18:56.801 --> 18:58.889
<i>this is gonna be shitty, right?</i>

18:58.981 --> 19:00.233
<i>This is gonna be crap.</i>

19:00.301 --> 19:01.717
<i>This is gonna be, like,</i>

19:01.785 --> 19:04.040
<i>just dumb
and we're not gonna care.</i>

19:04.108 --> 19:05.688
<i>And they get up
to the memorial.</i>

19:05.756 --> 19:08.055
<i>The-The granite
is sort of reflective.</i>

19:08.123 --> 19:10.245
<i>So what happens is
the Veterans would walk up</i>

19:10.322 --> 19:12.772
<i>and they would see themselves
reflected in the names</i>

19:12.840 --> 19:13.946
<i>of the fallen soldiers.</i>

19:14.014 --> 19:16.094
<i>And it was a very
emotional experience.</i>

19:16.171 --> 19:17.780
<i>And they were like, whoa.</i>

19:17.944 --> 19:20.233
<i>This is beautiful.</i>

19:20.340 --> 19:24.175
<i>Maya was, like,
watching all of this shit go down.</i>

19:24.252 --> 19:27.553
<i>And she was like,
I **** told you.</i>

19:27.866 --> 19:29.430
<i>I told you you would cry.</i>

19:29.507 --> 19:30.834
<i>See all these people crying?</i>

19:30.918 --> 19:32.873
<i>I told you they would cry.</i>

19:33.048 --> 19:35.709
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- She probably wasn't that mad.

19:36.421 --> 19:38.695
<i>Maya was able
to see this outcome</i>

19:38.827 --> 19:42.486
<i>and say, oh,
this really did</i>

19:42.554 --> 19:45.616
<i>have a really cool
impact on everybody.</i>

19:45.684 --> 19:49.780
<i>So Maya Lin goes from
this B student at Yale</i>

19:49.998 --> 19:53.131
<i>to one of the most
prominent architects</i>

19:53.199 --> 19:55.155
<i>and artists of our time.</i>

19:55.295 --> 19:58.153
<i>So Maya Lin's design
style made a difference.</i>

19:58.315 --> 20:01.147
<i>On... all the memorials
going forward.</i>

20:01.250 --> 20:03.915
<i>It all became
more abstract after that.</i>

20:03.983 --> 20:06.131
She really influenced
a lot of designers

20:06.199 --> 20:08.397
and architects and artists.

20:08.516 --> 20:11.131
<i>So in 2016, President Obama</i>

20:11.213 --> 20:13.428
<i>presented her with the
Presidential Medal of Freedom.</i>

20:13.496 --> 20:15.530
<i>Obama was like, uhh,</i>

20:16.654 --> 20:17.702
<i>good job.</i>

20:17.865 --> 20:19.412
<i>I love your work.</i>

20:19.690 --> 20:20.929
<i>Hope to see more of it.</i>

20:21.116 --> 20:22.342
And he kissed her on...

20:22.410 --> 20:23.851
right on the lips.
