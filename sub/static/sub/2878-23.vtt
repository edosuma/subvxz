WEBVTT

00:06.160 --> 00:07.360
Howard Wolowitz.

00:07.362 --> 00:09.529
Hey, Howard.
Dave Roeger here at NASA.

00:09.531 --> 00:11.814
We need to talk
about your upcoming mission.

00:11.816 --> 00:15.835
Yes, yes, I've been doing
my push-ups.

00:15.837 --> 00:18.955
I'm still stuck at nine, but...

00:21.158 --> 00:24.961
...that's going all the way down
with no one holding me.

00:24.963 --> 00:27.464
That's great, uh,
but that's not why I called.

00:27.466 --> 00:29.599
We've run into a bit of a snafu.

00:29.601 --> 00:32.101
Your Soyuz capsule failed
the pressurization test,

00:32.103 --> 00:35.688
so bottom line,
mission's been scrubbed.

00:37.441 --> 00:40.543
You're kidding.
So what does that mean?

00:40.545 --> 00:43.480
Uh-huh.

00:43.482 --> 00:45.231
Uh-huh.

00:45.233 --> 00:47.250
Boy, I got to tell you,

00:47.252 --> 00:48.902
I'm really disappointed.

00:48.904 --> 00:50.370
This was my dream

00:50.372 --> 00:53.490
ever since I was a little kid.

00:53.492 --> 00:55.241
Okay, well, uh,

00:55.243 --> 00:57.277
thanks for the call.

00:57.279 --> 00:59.963
Yep, you, too.

00:59.965 --> 01:01.697
Yes! Thank you!

01:01.699 --> 01:05.200
Oh! Oh...

01:05.203 --> 01:07.554
I'm not gonna die in space!

01:09.341 --> 01:11.724
I'm gonna die
the way God intended,

01:11.726 --> 01:15.094
in my late 50s,
with a heart full of pastrami.

== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==

01:45.696 --> 01:48.665
I'm going to need
a larger shirt.

01:51.886 --> 01:54.254
This one's a little tight
under the arms.

01:54.256 --> 01:55.722
Okay.

01:55.724 --> 01:57.090
Do you think maybe it's tight

01:57.092 --> 01:58.558
because you're wearing
long underwear?

01:58.560 --> 02:00.744
Yes, of course
that's why it's tight.

02:02.513 --> 02:03.980
All right, let me
rephrase the question.

02:03.982 --> 02:05.682
Why are you wearing
long underwear?

02:05.799 --> 02:07.165
You're kidding.

02:07.167 --> 02:10.201
Shouldn't the question be:
why <i>aren't</i> you?

02:10.203 --> 02:14.689
No, it should be: why are you?
(sighs) Leonard,

02:14.691 --> 02:16.858
these rental tuxedos have been

02:16.860 --> 02:18.993
worn by hundreds
of sweaty strangers.

02:19.789 --> 02:21.973
I don't like my own sweat
touching my skin,

02:21.975 --> 02:24.125
how do you think
I feel about theirs?

02:24.910 --> 02:26.828
Why don't you
slip this on?

02:26.830 --> 02:28.963
Said the hangman
offering a noose.

02:30.199 --> 02:31.916
Well, that wasn't
as entertaining

02:31.918 --> 02:33.618
as when he rents bowling shoes,

02:33.620 --> 02:35.537
but it was right up there.

02:35.539 --> 02:37.689
Well, that's it.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.457
My orders have been rescinded.

02:39.459 --> 02:41.826
I am officially "no go"
to space.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.045
I'm sorry, Howard,
but I got to tell you,

02:44.047 --> 02:46.014
I'm a little relieved
you're not going.

02:46.016 --> 02:47.164
Why?

02:47.166 --> 02:49.166
Come on, you were
gonna go up in a rocket

02:49.168 --> 02:51.302
designed in the 1960s
by the Russians.

02:51.304 --> 02:52.637
Yeah, so?

02:52.639 --> 02:54.639
When was the last time
you were at Best Buy

02:54.641 --> 02:56.841
and you heard someone say, "Ooh,
check out this Blu-ray player,

02:56.843 --> 02:59.227
it must be good,
it was built in Russia"?

03:01.063 --> 03:03.398
Well, their technology
isn't that bad.

03:03.400 --> 03:06.734
When you come back to Earth
in a Soyuz capsule, you free-fall

03:06.736 --> 03:08.703
from space
at 500 miles per hour,

03:08.705 --> 03:10.705
and the only thing
that slows you down

03:10.707 --> 03:12.490
is a little parachute
that pops out

03:12.492 --> 03:14.208
right before you crash
into the ground.

03:14.210 --> 03:15.693
And the whole thing
was designed

03:15.695 --> 03:18.246
by the same brilliant minds
who were unable to capture

03:18.248 --> 03:20.331
Rocky and Bullwinkle.

03:21.750 --> 03:23.367
All right, well, whatever.

03:23.369 --> 03:24.586
I wasn't worried.

03:24.588 --> 03:25.720
You weren't?

03:25.722 --> 03:29.340
Let me explain the difference
between you and me.

03:29.342 --> 03:30.725
You watch

03:30.727 --> 03:33.311
<i>Star Trek;</i> I live it.

03:35.230 --> 03:37.565
Oh, please. I don't remember
the episode of <i>Star Trek</i>

03:37.567 --> 03:39.183
where the guy
never goes to space

03:39.185 --> 03:41.886
and brags about it
in a tuxedo store.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.271
Make all the jokes you want,

03:43.273 --> 03:45.389
but there's only
one of us here brave enough

03:45.391 --> 03:47.742
to almost do
what I almost did.

03:47.744 --> 03:50.895
Ah, much better.

03:53.282 --> 03:55.166
You must be burning up.

03:55.168 --> 03:57.669
A little. But not more
than your urethras

03:57.671 --> 04:00.622
will be after whatever's
in those pants swims up them.

04:03.125 --> 04:04.459
Well...

04:04.461 --> 04:08.179
I cut quite the dashing,
yet hygienic figure, don't I?

04:08.181 --> 04:12.433
I look like the Flash
about to get married.

04:14.470 --> 04:16.220
Oh! A tissue! A tissue!

04:16.221 --> 04:17.639
Oh, good Lord!

04:17.641 --> 04:19.857
Uh, where's he going?

04:19.858 --> 04:22.226
He keeps emergency
Purell in the car.

04:22.228 --> 04:23.778
Keys! Keys! Keys!

04:27.933 --> 04:29.484
Hey, you.
Before I come in,

04:29.486 --> 04:32.770
you should know, I have gas.

04:32.772 --> 04:36.124
For the record,
not your worst opening line.

04:36.126 --> 04:38.026
Check it out.
It's the gas I use

04:38.028 --> 04:40.294
in my free-electron laser
to support high voltages.

04:40.296 --> 04:43.581
<i>But</i> it also has an
interesting secondary use.

04:45.168 --> 04:46.751
Here. Breathe this in.

04:46.753 --> 04:50.621
B-Before I do it, if you're
a cop you have tell me, right?

04:50.623 --> 04:52.640
Just try it.

04:52.642 --> 04:53.808
Okay.

04:55.345 --> 04:57.645
What's it supposed to...

04:57.647 --> 04:59.630
Oh, my God, that's so freaky!

05:03.136 --> 05:05.436
♪ You're a mean one ♪

05:05.438 --> 05:07.739
♪ Mr. Grinch. ♪

05:07.741 --> 05:09.607
Okay. Me, me, me. Ready?

05:10.576 --> 05:13.411
Leonard, I am your father.

05:15.982 --> 05:17.915
I have never been
more attracted to a woman

05:17.917 --> 05:19.667
who sounds like a man
in my life.

05:19.669 --> 05:21.452
Oh...

05:22.320 --> 05:23.538
Mm.

05:25.290 --> 05:27.842
Hey... you know
how we've been...

05:27.844 --> 05:30.712
taking things slow?
Mm-hmm.

05:30.714 --> 05:32.597
Well, I've been thinking, and...

05:32.599 --> 05:34.498
maybe I'm ready to...

05:34.500 --> 05:36.884
take things a little... faster.

05:36.886 --> 05:38.386
Oh...

05:38.388 --> 05:39.554
great.
Mm-hmm.

05:39.556 --> 05:41.639
And I promise,
after waiting four months,

05:41.641 --> 05:44.959
fast is what you're gonna get.

05:45.844 --> 05:47.511
You know, just-just one thing.

05:47.513 --> 05:49.397
Look, we're in a really
great place right now,

05:49.399 --> 05:50.698
and I don't want to do anything

05:50.700 --> 05:52.366
that will make stuff
all weird again.

05:52.368 --> 05:54.235
So we won't let it get weird.

05:54.237 --> 05:55.653
Okay. Oh, and just a heads-up...

05:55.655 --> 05:57.855
mm, since the last time
you saw me naked,

05:57.857 --> 05:59.490
I got a Cookie Monster tattoo.

05:59.492 --> 06:02.126
The acceptable responses
when you see it

06:02.128 --> 06:03.828
are "awesome" or nothing.

06:03.830 --> 06:05.997
What about...

06:05.999 --> 06:07.865
Cookies!

06:13.188 --> 06:14.972
Amy?

06:14.974 --> 06:16.257
Amy?

06:16.259 --> 06:18.509
Amy?

06:20.045 --> 06:21.729
7:00, right on time.

06:21.731 --> 06:24.098
It's not an accident.

06:24.100 --> 06:26.717
I waited outside your door
for 20 minutes.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.903
Well, dinner's almost ready.

06:28.905 --> 06:30.321
I must say,

06:30.323 --> 06:31.889
I was surprised
you chose to spend

06:31.891 --> 06:33.407
our date night
in your apartment.

06:33.409 --> 06:34.776
As I mentioned,

06:34.778 --> 06:39.063
the Pasadena City Council is
debating longer crosswalk times,

06:39.065 --> 06:42.366
and later, the LEGO store is
having a midnight madness sale.

06:42.368 --> 06:43.734
You ask anyone,

06:43.736 --> 06:45.119
that's a hot date.

06:45.121 --> 06:48.172
Tempting choices,
but I have something special

06:48.174 --> 06:49.406
planned for tonight.

06:49.408 --> 06:51.075
What can be more special
than having

06:51.077 --> 06:53.377
an adequate amount of time
to cross the street

06:53.379 --> 06:56.914
on your way to buy
a tiny LEGO Indiana Jones?

06:56.916 --> 06:59.350
With our friends moving forward
in their relationships,

06:59.352 --> 07:02.553
I've decided that we should
make progress in ours as well.

07:02.555 --> 07:04.605
Oh, dear Lord.

07:04.607 --> 07:07.358
Two years ago,
we didn't even know each other,

07:07.360 --> 07:10.611
and now I'm
in your apartment after dark.

07:11.480 --> 07:14.431
How much faster
can this thing go?

07:14.433 --> 07:16.234
I had a feeling
you'd be reluctant,

07:16.236 --> 07:18.152
which is why
I'm going to dip

07:18.154 --> 07:19.904
into my neurobiological
bag of tricks.

07:19.906 --> 07:23.474
Oh, you brain monkeys
kill me. Dip away.

07:24.326 --> 07:25.609
I have devised

07:25.611 --> 07:27.495
an experiment that
I believe will increase

07:27.497 --> 07:30.047
your feelings for me
in an accelerated time frame.

07:30.049 --> 07:32.283
And how do you propose
to do that?

07:32.285 --> 07:33.584
Uh, hope you're not thinking

07:33.586 --> 07:36.170
about some sort
of LSD thought control.

07:36.172 --> 07:37.421
Because there's

07:37.423 --> 07:39.640
only one mind-expanding drug
that this man enjoys,

07:39.642 --> 07:41.625
and that's called school.

07:41.627 --> 07:45.263
Human beings form emotional
attachments as they grow up.

07:45.265 --> 07:48.349
In your case, to your mother,
superheroes, et cetera.

07:48.351 --> 07:49.466
I'm going to attempt

07:49.468 --> 07:51.819
an experiment that will
get you to transfer

07:51.821 --> 07:53.487
those feelings to me.

07:53.489 --> 07:54.605
Well,

07:54.607 --> 07:56.240
seems what's on the menu tonight

07:56.242 --> 07:59.410
is malarkey with
a big side of poppycock.

07:59.412 --> 08:00.912
We'll see.

08:00.914 --> 08:04.498
Let's start with a little
romantic dinner music, shall we?

08:07.620 --> 08:09.987
Super Mario Bros. theme?

08:09.989 --> 08:11.172
Yes.

08:11.174 --> 08:13.824
I see what you're doing.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.459
You're attempting
to build on the work

08:15.461 --> 08:16.677
of Ebbinghaus by triggering

08:16.679 --> 08:19.630
an involuntary memory
of me playing that game--

08:19.632 --> 08:23.184
admittedly the happiest
600 hours of my childhood...

08:24.136 --> 08:25.269
...but it won't work.

08:25.271 --> 08:27.104
Fine. There's no reason
we still can't have

08:27.106 --> 08:29.140
a lovely dinner.
Why don't you have a seat.

08:31.828 --> 08:33.861
Boink! Boink!

08:35.313 --> 08:37.398
May I offer you
something to drink?

08:37.400 --> 08:38.982
You know I don't drink.

08:38.985 --> 08:40.234
Not even...

08:40.236 --> 08:41.485
strawberry Quik?

08:43.289 --> 08:45.740
I love strawberry Quik.

08:45.742 --> 08:48.910
It's my favorite
pink fluid,

08:48.912 --> 08:51.996
narrowly beating out
Pepto-Bismol.

08:51.998 --> 08:54.165
Oh, I know.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.967
I think it will go nicely

08:55.969 --> 08:57.785
with what I have prepared...

08:57.787 --> 08:59.253
for dinner.

08:59.255 --> 09:03.257
Spaghetti with little pieces
of hot dog cut up in it!

09:03.259 --> 09:04.429
Just like your mommy
used to make.

09:04.454 --> 09:05.477
Oh...

09:05.478 --> 09:08.145
yummy, yummy!

09:08.147 --> 09:11.148
We should do this more often.

09:17.689 --> 09:19.824
Uh-oh.

09:22.077 --> 09:23.227
I'm sorry. I did,

09:23.229 --> 09:24.779
I crossed a line.
I didn't mean to!

09:24.781 --> 09:26.664
Who says something
like that right in the middle

09:26.666 --> 09:28.032
of sex?!
I don't know,

09:28.034 --> 09:30.067
it just came out.
People say weird things

09:30.069 --> 09:31.419
during sex all the time.

09:31.421 --> 09:33.788
Okay, well, they
sure as hell don't say that.

09:33.790 --> 09:35.456
It was the heat of the moment.
No,

09:35.458 --> 09:38.075
the heat of the moment is,
"Ooh, yeah, just like that,"

09:38.077 --> 09:40.861
not "will you marry me?"

09:41.746 --> 09:43.097
I'm sorry.

09:43.099 --> 09:44.799
Just-just give me
another chance.

09:44.801 --> 09:46.600
Why, so you can crawl
under the covers and go,

09:46.602 --> 09:48.102
"Hey, baby,
want to go look for houses

09:48.104 --> 09:50.888
in neighborhoods
with good schools?"

09:50.890 --> 09:53.107
Again, I'm sorry.

09:53.109 --> 09:55.359
You know, with Howard
and Bernadette getting married,

09:55.361 --> 09:57.761
I got caught up
in a little wedding fever.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.397
I take it back.
You can't

09:59.399 --> 10:00.648
take something like that back.

10:00.650 --> 10:03.100
I mean, what are we
even supposed to do now?

10:03.102 --> 10:05.820
Okay, at some point,
we'll look back

10:05.822 --> 10:08.990
and this is going
to be a funny story.

10:08.992 --> 10:11.442
Why don't we just
start doing that now?

10:11.444 --> 10:13.294
You're kidding.
No.

10:13.296 --> 10:16.464
Hey, do you remember...

10:17.582 --> 10:20.217
...that time when I proposed

10:20.219 --> 10:23.087
to you in bed?

10:23.089 --> 10:26.590
And you were all, like,
"What are <i>you</i> doing?"

10:27.560 --> 10:29.727
That was so funny.

10:30.612 --> 10:33.798
So funny.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.099
It's not funny.

10:35.967 --> 10:38.085
Give it a minute.

10:38.887 --> 10:41.772
Is that a little smile
I see there?

10:42.474 --> 10:45.259
I should go.

10:46.478 --> 10:48.195
Hey, I was thinking.

10:48.197 --> 10:50.147
For our first dance
at the wedding,

10:50.149 --> 10:54.035
what if we learn the final number
from <i>Dirty Dancing?</i>

10:54.037 --> 10:56.454
You're kidding.
No,

10:56.456 --> 10:57.821
come on.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.273
How cool would that be?

10:59.275 --> 11:03.194
Me running
into your arms...

11:03.196 --> 11:05.496
you lifting me up
into the air.

11:06.831 --> 11:09.266
Oh, you're in a good mood.

11:09.268 --> 11:10.634
Yeah, well, why
wouldn't I be?

11:10.636 --> 11:13.054
You know, I'm marrying
the girl of my dreams,

11:13.056 --> 11:14.805
and I finally got
my mother to agree

11:14.807 --> 11:17.224
not to come on
our honeymoon.

11:18.009 --> 11:20.344
Oh, hang on.

11:21.196 --> 11:22.396
Oh, it's NASA.

11:23.565 --> 11:24.899
Wolowitz.

11:24.901 --> 11:27.802
Oh! Hi, Dave.
What's up?

11:29.321 --> 11:31.872
No kidding. Really?

11:31.874 --> 11:33.023
Well,

11:33.025 --> 11:36.660
that's... great news.

11:36.662 --> 11:39.530
Great, great news.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.916
All right, I'll watch my e-mail

11:41.918 --> 11:44.301
for the details.

11:44.303 --> 11:46.470
Okay, talk soon.

11:47.906 --> 11:49.006
What's so great?

11:49.008 --> 11:52.309
It looks like I'm going
into space after all.

11:53.596 --> 11:56.180
Oh, Howie,
that's wonderful!

11:56.182 --> 11:58.349
Uh-huh, wonderful.

11:59.267 --> 12:02.770
Yay...

12:08.552 --> 12:10.136
What happened?
I thought

12:10.138 --> 12:12.305
they canceled your mission.
Th-They did.

12:12.307 --> 12:14.507
But NASA really wants

12:14.509 --> 12:16.893
my telescope up
on the space station,

12:16.895 --> 12:19.762
so they're putting me
on an earlier launch.

12:19.764 --> 12:21.764
When?
A...

12:21.766 --> 12:24.066
week from Friday.

12:24.068 --> 12:26.936
What? We're getting
married that Sunday.

12:28.005 --> 12:29.171
You're right!

12:29.173 --> 12:30.806
I-I can't go to space.

12:30.808 --> 12:33.309
I have to get married,
and no one can say

12:33.311 --> 12:35.661
that's not a good reason.
I'll call him back.

12:37.698 --> 12:39.332
Wait. I don't want to be

12:39.334 --> 12:41.150
the one who stands
in your way.

12:41.152 --> 12:42.985
Well, too bad, you already did.
It's a done deal.

12:42.987 --> 12:45.087
Oh, well.
But I forgive you.

12:45.089 --> 12:47.323
No. That's not how I want
to start our marriage,

12:47.325 --> 12:48.708
killing your dream?

12:48.710 --> 12:50.626
We'll have the wedding
when you get back.

12:50.628 --> 12:52.128
But wh-what about

12:52.130 --> 12:55.197
all the plans
and the guests?

12:55.199 --> 12:56.299
We'll call them.

12:56.301 --> 12:58.267
Although my dad's
gonna go a little nutso

12:58.269 --> 13:00.353
over losing his deposits.

13:00.355 --> 13:04.273
You're right, he is!

13:04.275 --> 13:06.025
Your dad's gonna be furious.

13:06.027 --> 13:08.861
There's no way he's
gonna let us postpone this wedding.

13:08.863 --> 13:10.296
Well, we tried.

13:11.698 --> 13:12.949
I'll talk to him.

13:12.951 --> 13:15.517
He won't say no to his little girl.
No!

13:15.519 --> 13:18.354
I-I should talk to him,

13:18.356 --> 13:19.822
man to man.

13:19.824 --> 13:21.657
But, Howie, my dad
can be a bully.

13:21.659 --> 13:23.659
He's gonna make you cancel
your space flight.

13:23.661 --> 13:24.994
We can only hope...

13:24.996 --> 13:27.113
that he doesn't.

13:28.332 --> 13:32.534
Bishop to queen four,

13:32.536 --> 13:34.236
level two.

13:34.238 --> 13:36.172
Check.

13:36.174 --> 13:37.840
Sheldon...

13:37.842 --> 13:39.475
knight takes bishop.

13:40.060 --> 13:41.344
You all right?

13:41.346 --> 13:43.512
I'm fine.

13:44.514 --> 13:45.648
Are you?

13:45.650 --> 13:47.883
You left your queen
exposed from above,

13:47.885 --> 13:49.602
you trapped your
knight in the corner,

13:49.604 --> 13:53.122
and you keep sighing
and saying, "Why me?"

13:54.776 --> 13:56.275
Very well.

13:56.277 --> 13:59.395
Can I ask you
a question about women?

14:00.364 --> 14:02.698
We got you that book last year.

14:02.700 --> 14:04.583
Wasn't everything in there?

14:04.585 --> 14:08.537
No, I'm having
a relationship problem with Amy.

14:08.539 --> 14:09.505
And by the way,

14:09.507 --> 14:11.824
that book gave me nightmares.

14:11.826 --> 14:14.627
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

14:14.629 --> 14:17.380
I screwed things up
pretty good with Penny.

14:17.382 --> 14:19.882
Look at us,
Leonard...

14:19.884 --> 14:22.685
engaging in the social
convention of men bellyaching

14:22.687 --> 14:24.804
about their ol' ladies.

14:24.806 --> 14:26.939
I guess we are.

14:26.941 --> 14:29.775
So, what's going on?

14:29.777 --> 14:31.427
Believe it or not,

14:31.429 --> 14:33.863
Amy has embarked on a campaign

14:33.865 --> 14:39.768
to increase my feelings
for her by making me happy.

14:39.770 --> 14:43.823
I'm sorry, that must be very
difficult for you.

14:43.825 --> 14:45.825
It's awful.

14:45.827 --> 14:47.827
This morning,
she arranged for me

14:47.829 --> 14:50.446
to be an Amtrak junior conductor
for the day.

14:50.448 --> 14:51.580
It-It's usually

14:51.582 --> 14:52.798
only open to children.

14:52.800 --> 14:55.801
She got them
to make an exception.

14:55.803 --> 14:58.220
Shame on her.

14:58.222 --> 15:01.173
They let me
blow the whistle, Leonard.

15:01.175 --> 15:04.293
She's good.

15:04.295 --> 15:05.227
I know.

15:05.229 --> 15:06.929
<i>And</i> it gets worse.

15:06.931 --> 15:08.814
Her efforts are causing me

15:08.816 --> 15:11.133
to have affectionate
feelings for her

15:11.135 --> 15:14.270
at inappropriate times.

15:15.405 --> 15:19.075
You mean, like in bed
or in the shower?

15:19.077 --> 15:20.409
No!

15:20.411 --> 15:23.662
Would you please stop
referencing that infernal book?

15:24.815 --> 15:26.782
For example, this morning,

15:26.784 --> 15:29.034
I was calculating
the random motion

15:29.036 --> 15:31.003
of virtual particles
in a vacuum,

15:31.005 --> 15:33.839
when suddenly
the particles morphed

15:33.841 --> 15:37.376
into an image
of Amy's dandruff...

15:40.647 --> 15:42.264
...gently cascading down

15:42.266 --> 15:46.001
onto her pale,
slightly hunched shoulders.

15:47.488 --> 15:50.606
What has that vixen
done to me, Leonard?

15:50.608 --> 15:52.374
And how do I make it stop?

15:52.376 --> 15:54.743
Well, if you had
a physical relationship,

15:54.745 --> 15:56.612
I'd say propose during sex.

15:56.614 --> 15:59.932
Turns out that's
a real mood kill.

15:59.934 --> 16:01.700
I assume we're talking
about you now?

16:01.702 --> 16:02.685
Yeah.

16:02.687 --> 16:03.852
So, that's
how this works?

16:03.854 --> 16:06.188
I complain,
and then you complain,

16:06.190 --> 16:08.857
and no one offers any solutions?

16:08.859 --> 16:11.694
Pretty much.

16:11.696 --> 16:14.863
Well, no wonder
the women are winning.

16:18.336 --> 16:20.836
Mr. Rostenkowski,
are you busy?

16:20.838 --> 16:23.539
Oh, just looking at some
old pictures. Come on in.

16:23.541 --> 16:25.090
Family pictures,
or...?

16:25.092 --> 16:28.377
H-Holy crap, that's
a dead person.

16:28.379 --> 16:31.564
Last murder case
before I retired.

16:31.566 --> 16:33.599
How many bodies
do you see there?

16:33.601 --> 16:34.717
Careful,

16:34.719 --> 16:37.086
it's a trick question.

16:37.088 --> 16:39.271
I'm not sure.

16:39.273 --> 16:40.656
Nah, you'll never get it.

16:40.658 --> 16:43.442
It's a fraction.

16:43.444 --> 16:45.611
How about that.

16:45.613 --> 16:46.745
Anyway,

16:46.747 --> 16:49.231
sir, I need to talk
to you about something.

16:50.334 --> 16:52.001
Walnut?

16:52.003 --> 16:53.702
No, thank you.

16:53.704 --> 16:55.037
I'm allergic.

16:55.039 --> 16:56.738
Oh, sure.

16:56.740 --> 16:59.091
My partner used to have that.

16:59.093 --> 17:00.742
He's dead now.

17:02.295 --> 17:03.762
From nuts?

17:03.764 --> 17:05.446
Nah, his wife shot him.

17:06.266 --> 17:10.202
But she was nuts,
so in a way...

17:11.188 --> 17:12.471
Nice story.

17:12.473 --> 17:14.138
Anyway,

17:14.141 --> 17:16.592
the reason I wanted
to talk to you is

17:16.594 --> 17:19.278
NASA has moved up
my launch

17:19.280 --> 17:21.530
to the International
Space Station.

17:21.531 --> 17:23.365
Yeah, so?
So...

17:23.367 --> 17:25.867
the date is going
to conflict

17:25.869 --> 17:27.903
with me marrying
your daughter.

17:27.905 --> 17:30.105
Now, I know what you're
going to say-- I made

17:30.107 --> 17:32.124
a commitment to Bernadette
and to your family

17:32.126 --> 17:34.109
and I've got a hell
of a lot of nerve

17:34.111 --> 17:36.328
coming in here and demanding
that we postpone this thing.

17:36.330 --> 17:37.997
Well, message heard
and understood.

17:37.999 --> 17:39.632
Mission canceled.
Thank you.

17:41.117 --> 17:42.251
Where are you going?

17:42.253 --> 17:44.053
I'm sorry.

17:44.055 --> 17:46.589
May I be excused?

17:46.591 --> 17:48.090
No, you may not.

17:48.092 --> 17:49.475
Let me tell you something.

17:49.477 --> 17:51.393
When I first met you...

17:51.395 --> 17:52.794
You just gonna stand there?

17:52.796 --> 17:56.649
I'm sorry, I didn't know,
is this going to...

17:56.651 --> 17:57.766
Well, I should sit...

17:57.768 --> 17:59.485
May I be seat...
Well, I'll just sit.

18:01.438 --> 18:03.956
When I first met you,

18:03.958 --> 18:05.507
I didn't like you.

18:05.509 --> 18:08.944
I'm aware of that, sir.

18:08.946 --> 18:11.947
But then you and I
had some time together.

18:11.949 --> 18:12.981
Uh-huh.

18:12.983 --> 18:15.834
It did not get better.

18:15.836 --> 18:18.187
Right, right.

18:18.189 --> 18:20.289
That silly Beatle haircut

18:20.291 --> 18:21.490
and...

18:21.492 --> 18:23.542
you riding around
on a red Vespa,

18:23.544 --> 18:26.428
and you're still living
at home with your mother.

18:26.430 --> 18:29.465
To be honest, I thought
Bernadette chose you

18:29.467 --> 18:31.267
to punish me.

18:32.769 --> 18:35.671
But then I heard about
your astronaut thing,

18:35.673 --> 18:37.273
and I realized

18:37.275 --> 18:39.475
I judged you too fast.

18:39.477 --> 18:40.809
Maybe you are

18:40.811 --> 18:42.728
the right guy
for my little girl.

18:42.730 --> 18:45.064
Oh, I am.
And just so you know,

18:45.066 --> 18:48.233
I'd still be an astronaut,
even if I didn't go to space.

18:48.235 --> 18:52.288
I've got an I.D. card
and a NASA golf shirt.

18:52.290 --> 18:53.706
No, no, you got to go.

18:53.708 --> 18:55.991
You can't turn down
an opportunity like this.

18:55.993 --> 18:58.360
B-But what about the wedding

18:58.362 --> 19:01.080
and all the money you put
down for the reception?

19:01.082 --> 19:02.965
You let me worry about that.

19:02.967 --> 19:04.783
You go up to that
space station,

19:04.785 --> 19:06.986
and you make me proud.

19:11.424 --> 19:12.658
Um, okay.

19:13.761 --> 19:15.711
You got a problem with that?

19:15.713 --> 19:18.213
All right, look, I'm
gonna level with you.

19:18.215 --> 19:21.550
I'm terrified about
going into space.

19:21.552 --> 19:25.154
What if I don't
make it back?

19:25.156 --> 19:28.741
It's gonna be okay, son.

19:28.743 --> 19:31.143
You really think so?

19:31.145 --> 19:33.045
Of course.

19:33.047 --> 19:35.681
A pretty girl like Bernadette...

19:35.683 --> 19:38.150
she'll find a new guy.

19:50.031 --> 19:51.214
Hey.

19:51.216 --> 19:52.516
Hey.

19:52.518 --> 19:53.717
Off to work?

19:53.719 --> 19:54.852
Yeah.

19:54.854 --> 19:56.186
Have a nice night.

19:56.188 --> 19:57.888
Okay, you, too.

19:58.707 --> 20:00.223
Penny, just, wait.

20:00.225 --> 20:02.109
I've been thinking
about what I said

20:02.111 --> 20:04.178
when we were in bed
the other night.

20:04.180 --> 20:06.280
Yeah, I've been
thinking about it, too.

20:06.282 --> 20:08.716
I noticed you never answered me.

20:10.335 --> 20:12.503
You're right.

20:16.341 --> 20:18.509
No.

20:20.762 --> 20:22.880
Uh, follow-up.
Are we still dating?

20:22.882 --> 20:24.247
Yep.

20:24.249 --> 20:25.966
Is it still weird
'cause I proposed?

20:25.968 --> 20:27.668
Yep.

20:27.670 --> 20:29.603
I have a couple more
quick questions.

20:29.605 --> 20:30.827
Do you want to call me
from the car?

20:30.852 --> 20:32.852
No!

20:34.225 --> 20:36.860
Think I played that
pretty well.

20:49.758 --> 20:51.775
Hello, Leonard.

20:51.777 --> 20:52.910
What are you doing?

20:52.912 --> 20:55.312
We're playing doctor.

20:55.847 --> 20:59.199
<i>Star Trek</i> style.

21:00.018 --> 21:03.454
I'm in hell, Leonard.

21:03.456 --> 21:04.955
Don't stop.

21:04.957 --> 21:08.957
