WEBVTT

03:11.962 --> 03:13.663
Move! Come on!

03:16.432 --> 03:19.102
Go on! Get in there!

03:19.135 --> 03:21.771
Stop. Turn around.

03:21.804 --> 03:24.240
You're gonna punch in the combination
of the vault for me.

03:24.274 --> 03:25.408
Now move.

03:26.509 --> 03:29.079
Allow for emergency to begin.

03:29.112 --> 03:32.915
Nothing yet near. We're on the clock.
Eight minutes.

03:37.620 --> 03:39.655
Robert Crane.

03:39.689 --> 03:41.391
That's right, you look at me.

03:41.424 --> 03:43.093
Because your wife, Cynthia,

03:43.126 --> 03:45.495
and your son, Darren,
are at home thinking of you.

03:45.528 --> 03:49.032
This is not your money.
You got me?

03:50.500 --> 03:52.102
So punch it in.

04:01.544 --> 04:03.713
19 Unit, two miles away.

04:05.015 --> 04:06.049
Five minutes.

04:08.218 --> 04:09.485
Give me the card.

04:09.519 --> 04:11.421
- Trackers?
- Shelves three and six.

04:11.454 --> 04:13.289
Only the ones with blue labels.

04:13.323 --> 04:15.125
Moore and Hank, two, four and five.

04:15.158 --> 04:16.326
On the right.

04:16.358 --> 04:18.226
Now be a good boy and get on the floor.
Don't move.

04:18.228 --> 04:21.964
- Port, to emergency tricar, ETA?
- Three minutes.

04:24.300 --> 04:26.436
Three minutes. Need to move.

04:37.680 --> 04:40.016
Scanner nulla. Come on.

04:41.751 --> 04:44.020
You deaf? We need to move.

04:53.363 --> 04:56.199
Jack, we need to go now.

05:18.521 --> 05:21.023
Come on...
Come on, Jack.

05:28.764 --> 05:30.700
Come on.

06:34.197 --> 06:35.798
Hm.

06:44.607 --> 06:46.542
Did you tell him?

06:48.311 --> 06:52.182
He knows.
I told him everything.

06:56.852 --> 06:59.522
I love you so much, nan.

08:03.553 --> 08:05.321
DCI Wickstead.

08:10.893 --> 08:16.632
Four armed masked men reroute
the alarms, disable the CCTV,

08:16.666 --> 08:20.270
and send a fully armed
C-9 team response unit

08:20.303 --> 08:23.773
halfway across to the
wrong side of London.

08:23.806 --> 08:27.377
So that's four robberies in the last
five years, all with the same MO.

08:27.410 --> 08:29.545
They just bowled in like
a day at the dogs.

08:29.579 --> 08:33.716
You're not making a fucking
mugger out of me, Cregan.

08:35.851 --> 08:38.688
I want Jack Cregan on full surveillance.

08:38.721 --> 08:42.424
- Jack Cregan?
- Yeah, Jack Cregan. 6'4".

08:42.457 --> 08:44.594
Scary looking fucker.
You can't miss him.

08:47.597 --> 08:48.764
Sir?

08:50.666 --> 08:51.834
What?

08:51.867 --> 08:54.035
I just wondered what you thought
our chances were this time?

08:54.036 --> 08:55.971
Our chances?

08:56.005 --> 08:58.574
Yeah, well I know you've dealt
with the family before, sir.

08:58.608 --> 09:00.876
The old man, Alfie Cregan.
You nearly had him once.

09:00.910 --> 09:03.478
Just wondered what you thought
our chances were of getting his son.

09:03.479 --> 09:06.616
I mean, he seems different in
his profile. I mean, he is slick, sir.

09:06.649 --> 09:08.584
He's never been nicked.
You think he's...

09:08.618 --> 09:12.988
- You sound like a fan, Julian.
- Sorry, sir.

09:13.022 --> 09:14.457
Now go and talk to some witnesses.

09:14.490 --> 09:15.891
Yes, sir.

09:43.619 --> 09:45.488
Oi, liven up.
What's with the long bow?

09:45.521 --> 09:48.090
Well, I haven't heard
a word from you all morning.

09:48.123 --> 09:49.359
Nothing.

09:49.392 --> 09:50.693
I was worried.

09:50.726 --> 09:52.894
Yeah, well, there's nothing to
worry about. We're all good.

09:52.895 --> 09:54.730
Everything sorted with the old mugger?

09:54.764 --> 09:58.901
Oh, I, uh...
I haven't had a chance.

09:58.934 --> 10:02.438
You ain't had a chance.
What the fuck you been doin'?

10:02.472 --> 10:04.607
I had something to take care of.

10:04.640 --> 10:07.977
- But don't worry, I'll get it sorted.
- Dad, listen to me.

10:08.010 --> 10:09.812
We can't have all this
wrapped around us.

10:09.845 --> 10:11.914
We need to get it moved now.
Make sure you do.

10:11.947 --> 10:15.751
Yeah, I'll get it moved.
I'll get it moved tonight.

10:20.690 --> 10:21.691
What's wrong?

10:21.724 --> 10:25.895
Nothing, I had, uh...
I had a lot on my mind.

10:25.928 --> 10:30.800
That's all. Leave it to me.
I'm on it.

10:33.503 --> 10:34.937
Sam, you ready?

10:38.173 --> 10:40.843
Jack. Come here.

10:43.913 --> 10:45.715
Talk to me.

10:45.748 --> 10:47.717
Uh...

10:49.985 --> 10:51.654
I love you, son, you know.

10:53.856 --> 10:55.725
Of course I do.

10:58.694 --> 10:59.829
I'll talk to you later.

11:00.896 --> 11:03.833
Right, hey, I'll see you tonight.

11:10.139 --> 11:12.575
Smoked salmon and scrambled eggs,

11:12.608 --> 11:15.545
accompanied by a lovely
glass of champagne,

11:15.578 --> 11:17.947
for the most beautiful woman
in the world.

11:19.515 --> 11:22.452
- I think a little toast.
- Okay.

11:23.453 --> 11:25.655
To us and the future.

11:30.960 --> 11:35.064
You are so sweet and such a good cook.

11:35.097 --> 11:37.032
Well, that is why you
married an older man.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.068
...live on the scene.

11:39.101 --> 11:41.136
The four, heavily-armed men

11:41.170 --> 11:43.473
escaped with a substantial
amount of cash.

11:43.506 --> 11:47.810
This robbery bearing all the same
hallmarks of four previous raids.

11:47.843 --> 11:50.480
Detectives are still
awaiting extradition rights

11:50.513 --> 11:53.649
for this man, wanted fugitive
Raymond Dixon,

11:53.683 --> 11:56.719
- from Spain's Costa del Sol.
- What does this mean?

11:56.752 --> 11:58.888
What it said, they want him back.

11:58.921 --> 12:00.690
Don't worry, he would never fold.

12:00.723 --> 12:02.458
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

12:02.492 --> 12:05.628
...to be the mastermind behind
an alleged string of armed robberies.

12:05.661 --> 12:07.630
Specialized anti-robbery units

12:07.663 --> 12:10.099
working alongside
the National Crime Agency

12:10.132 --> 12:13.803
have pledged to do whatever it takes
to bring these gangs down.

12:30.553 --> 12:34.724
- With compliments on the house.
- Oh, thank you very much, Pippa.

12:34.757 --> 12:37.793
Pippa, go and ask Lenny.
See if he wants to join us.

12:37.827 --> 12:38.828
All right.

12:40.095 --> 12:42.732
Ed. What are you doing?

12:42.765 --> 12:44.767
Well, you know the old wives tale, Jack.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.969
Keep your friends close,
and your enemies...

12:47.002 --> 12:48.203
...even closer.

12:48.237 --> 12:51.106
Well, here we go.
Here we go. Look.

12:51.140 --> 12:55.277
Official police statement is,
we cleaned out...

12:55.310 --> 12:56.612
an amazing...

12:56.646 --> 13:02.618
four million worth of beautiful
pink pictures of Her Majesty.

13:02.652 --> 13:05.955
Well, all I have to say is,
to The Queen.

13:05.988 --> 13:08.558
- To The Queen!
- God bless her.

13:09.625 --> 13:13.062
Right, so, minus expenses,
there's 800 large each.

13:13.095 --> 13:14.128
The rest goes to Raymondo.

13:14.129 --> 13:16.599
He's a renegade.
He's all over the fucking news.

13:16.632 --> 13:18.568
- They want him bad.
- Yeah, I know, I saw it.

13:18.601 --> 13:20.870
But, listen, Ray's no mug.
He'll let it be it.

13:22.037 --> 13:24.173
Oi, oi, here he is.

13:24.206 --> 13:26.108
Sorry, Jack, Lenny's off tonight.

13:26.141 --> 13:28.110
Anything you want is on the house.

13:28.143 --> 13:30.980
Thanks, Steve.
How's your dad?

13:31.013 --> 13:32.582
He's good, thanks.

13:32.615 --> 13:33.983
Still playing golf every day?

13:34.016 --> 13:36.251
Yep, every day still.
You all right?

13:36.285 --> 13:37.219
Yeah, I'm good, man.

13:37.252 --> 13:39.755
All right. Well,
have a great night, guys.

13:40.856 --> 13:42.892
He's a good kid, him.
Comes from a proper family.

13:42.925 --> 13:46.261
- Good looking fella.
- All right, then, listen.

13:46.295 --> 13:50.032
Over the years,
we've been very, very lucky.

13:50.065 --> 13:52.868
We made a shitload of money
today and no one caught us.

13:54.637 --> 13:58.808
So what we all agreed?
From this moment on, it all ends.

14:00.242 --> 14:01.644
We've done what we needed to

14:01.677 --> 14:03.646
and we've always done it well.

14:03.679 --> 14:06.649
Brings a tear to my eye.

14:07.717 --> 14:08.951
I'm being serious.

14:08.984 --> 14:11.887
So are we all agreed?
To new beginnings.

14:11.921 --> 14:14.757
- To new beginnings.
- To new beginnings.

14:31.974 --> 14:33.776
Where's the fucking money?

14:37.813 --> 14:41.651
I'm gonna ask you one
last time, old man.

14:41.684 --> 14:46.055
- Where's the fucking money?
- Fuck off, you cunt.

14:48.357 --> 14:51.661
Let's see how fucking
brave you are now, eh?

14:51.694 --> 14:53.062
Where is it?!

14:53.095 --> 14:56.999
Fuck off, you slimy fucking pimp.

15:00.970 --> 15:04.940
Not so fucking bright
now, are ya?! Are ya?!

15:09.311 --> 15:11.080
You're too full of it!

15:11.113 --> 15:14.216
Go on, fucking do it,
you cocksucking fucker.

15:15.417 --> 15:17.119
You fucking slimy cunt!

15:19.822 --> 15:21.256
Go on, fucking do it!

15:22.391 --> 15:24.393
Come on, do it!

15:31.867 --> 15:35.037
Search the place.
Charlie...

17:25.446 --> 17:27.316
Jack, we should go.

17:27.348 --> 17:29.251
Everyone is back at the house now.

17:29.284 --> 17:32.254
- Yeah.
- You okay?

17:34.089 --> 17:35.524
Yeah, I'm all right.

17:37.860 --> 17:40.996
- You know they're watching us.
- Yeah, I know.

18:00.315 --> 18:02.351
I'm not saying let it go,

18:02.384 --> 18:04.253
but we need to seriously
think about this.

18:04.286 --> 18:06.321
Think about what, Sam?
I'm not with ya.

18:06.355 --> 18:09.091
Four million quid is gone.

18:09.124 --> 18:11.827
And I've just watched my dad,

18:11.861 --> 18:13.996
your uncle, be put
in the fucking ground.

18:14.029 --> 18:15.397
We need to find out who did it

18:15.430 --> 18:17.900
and how did they know
the money was there

18:17.933 --> 18:19.268
at that exact time.

18:19.301 --> 18:20.970
We've got to look
at this logically, Jack.

18:21.003 --> 18:24.206
We've done business with
most of the firms in London.

18:24.239 --> 18:26.208
It could be anyone.

18:26.241 --> 18:28.077
Should have turned us in years ago.

18:28.110 --> 18:29.210
If you would have
listened to me and Frank,

18:29.211 --> 18:32.281
we'd be making a fucking
fortune at the other gig.

18:32.314 --> 18:34.248
- And we wouldn't be in this shit.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:34.249 --> 18:35.484
And Alfie would still be here.

18:35.517 --> 18:37.286
Well, let's get it right, Sam.

18:37.319 --> 18:38.888
If we would have listened to you,

18:38.921 --> 18:41.290
we would have been doing
a 30 stretch or dead.

18:41.323 --> 18:43.291
And we'd fuckin' ubered over there.
The amount of gear...

18:43.292 --> 18:45.060
Hey, boy...
Who are you talking to...?

18:45.094 --> 18:46.896
- Boy?
- Who are you talking to, boy?

18:46.929 --> 18:48.529
- Are you boy enough, eh?
- Who the fuck you talking to?

18:48.530 --> 18:50.499
Oi. Oi. Oi!

18:50.532 --> 18:53.102
Sit down and remember where you are.

18:56.438 --> 18:59.208
None of that shit matters anymore.

19:01.076 --> 19:04.013
Look, as a group, let's
not forget something here.

19:04.046 --> 19:06.916
That bit of money was our out money.

19:06.949 --> 19:09.151
So what we gonna do now?

19:09.184 --> 19:13.188
Like I said, we need
to think about this.

19:13.222 --> 19:15.324
We've got the NCA breathing down
our fucking necks.

19:15.357 --> 19:16.491
Wickstead on our case.

19:16.525 --> 19:19.962
He never got Alfie, so now
he's obsessed with you, Jack.

19:23.065 --> 19:25.434
Like you've always told me... told us.

19:26.501 --> 19:28.503
Never panic.
Deep breath.

19:28.537 --> 19:31.006
Count to ten before you do anything.

19:31.040 --> 19:33.542
Don't treat me like mug
and get yourself nicked now.

19:36.011 --> 19:39.648
Let the dust settle.
Wait.

21:16.345 --> 21:18.480
I love you, son, you know?

21:46.175 --> 21:47.676
You want me to get a closer look?

21:47.709 --> 21:49.644
Nah, don't bother.

22:07.762 --> 22:10.832
There was a time when
we would have fitted him up

22:10.865 --> 22:16.138
with a tape from another bloke,
even if it didn't stick.

22:16.171 --> 22:18.407
He would have had his card marked.

22:20.275 --> 22:23.245
The bad old days, you mean.

22:23.278 --> 22:28.117
Yeah, yeah, the bad old days before
there was forensics, and DNA,

22:28.150 --> 22:30.985
and all the other stuff that
we haven't fucking got on him.

22:35.257 --> 22:39.394
You have no new messages.
One saved message.

22:40.429 --> 22:42.331
Alfie, it's Holly.

22:42.364 --> 22:45.400
Let me know what time you arrive
and what time you can get to the club.

22:47.068 --> 22:48.069
To listen to the message
again, press one.

22:48.103 --> 22:51.606
To call the number back, press two.

22:53.007 --> 22:55.577
Hi, this is Holly. I'm back
in Marbella at the moment,

22:55.610 --> 22:57.179
but I'll be picking up messages.

22:58.213 --> 22:59.248
Holly, you don't know me.

22:59.281 --> 23:02.351
My name is Jack Cregan,
I'm Alfie Cregan's son.

23:02.384 --> 23:06.288
Can you do me a favor and call me
back urgently on this number?

24:20.262 --> 24:25.734
He's gonna go in there
and he's gonna murder many more.

24:27.836 --> 24:29.304
Should I call it in?

24:29.338 --> 24:35.310
No. Let him do us all a fucking favor.

24:36.978 --> 24:39.748
You're absolutely beautiful, darling.

24:39.781 --> 24:42.527
You're as cute as a button,
you know that.

24:42.529 --> 24:43.486
Thank you.

24:44.853 --> 24:47.322
Jack, what a surprise.

24:47.356 --> 24:49.258
It was a beautiful turnout yesterday.

24:49.291 --> 24:52.927
- Yeah, yeah, it was.
- You want a drink?

24:52.961 --> 24:55.297
- Yeah.
- Steve.

24:56.265 --> 24:58.467
- Hi, Jack.
- How are ya, Steve?

24:58.500 --> 25:00.700
- What are you having?
- I'll have a vodka tonic please.

25:00.702 --> 25:03.572
- Lime?
- Yeah.

25:07.776 --> 25:09.478
Cheers, mate.

25:11.813 --> 25:14.283
Sorry about the old man.

25:14.316 --> 25:15.817
I really appreciate it.

25:20.689 --> 25:22.724
Sorry about your old man.

25:28.397 --> 25:30.632
He knew it.

25:30.665 --> 25:32.634
There is nothing in this world
that hurts me more

25:32.667 --> 25:35.404
than paying someone good fucking wages,

25:35.437 --> 25:37.306
then to find out that they raided!

25:37.339 --> 25:39.841
Feeding off ya.
Having you over.

25:39.874 --> 25:43.345
Biting the fucking hand that feeds ya!

25:43.378 --> 25:45.347
Ain't that right, Steve?

25:47.416 --> 25:49.418
What are you talking about?

25:49.451 --> 25:52.621
You want me to put it in plain
fucking English, shall I?

25:52.654 --> 25:54.756
Dipping in the Jack and Jill.

25:58.493 --> 26:01.396
Right or wrong?
Right or wrong?

26:01.430 --> 26:03.965
Leave him, he is a fucking kid.
What's the matter with ya?

26:03.998 --> 26:07.602
Who the fuck are you?
Comin' here and give it large?

26:07.636 --> 26:09.871
That was a fucking libby
and you know it.

26:11.506 --> 26:12.907
Libby.

26:16.545 --> 26:19.781
Who the fuck you think
you're talking to?

26:19.814 --> 26:21.115
Sounds like his old man.

26:21.149 --> 26:24.018
If he ain't careful, he's going
to wind up like him and all.

26:26.621 --> 26:28.957
What the fuck you doing here
on your own, anyway?

26:31.059 --> 26:34.363
I just came here 'cause
I wanted to talk to you.

26:34.396 --> 26:38.032
Yeah, well, I know nothing
about your old man.

26:38.066 --> 26:39.934
All I know is that
you were the last person

26:39.968 --> 26:41.636
to speak to him before he died.

26:41.670 --> 26:43.905
- Now what you want me to say?
- On his fucking mobile.

26:43.938 --> 26:47.609
Your name, your number.
Now, did you speak to him?

26:53.548 --> 26:56.551
Yeah, I did speak to him.

26:57.419 --> 26:59.588
About a bit of private business

26:59.621 --> 27:02.056
that's got nothing to do with you.

27:02.090 --> 27:05.660
I speak to a lot of people
about a lot of things.

27:05.694 --> 27:08.930
They also got nothing to do with you!

27:08.963 --> 27:12.401
I'll tell you what, if I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

27:14.135 --> 27:18.006
You're one lucky fucking face.

27:33.688 --> 27:35.790
I'm going to go and check it out.

27:46.735 --> 27:50.739
No, I'm doing it my way.
You hear me? My fucking way!

27:50.772 --> 27:54.676
I should have done him and his old man
together the way I fucking said.

28:15.764 --> 28:16.931
Hello?

28:16.965 --> 28:19.834
Jack, it's Steve.
I'm still at the hospital.

28:19.868 --> 28:21.903
They kept me in overnight.

28:21.936 --> 28:24.906
They're gonna do some more tests
'cause I came in unconscious.

28:24.939 --> 28:27.575
Well, that's good, because it's always
best to be sure, you know that.

28:27.576 --> 28:31.580
Look, Jack...
I just wanna say thanks.

28:31.613 --> 28:34.516
Don't be daft. You don't have
to thank me for nothing.

28:35.917 --> 28:37.185
Listen, there's, um...

28:37.218 --> 28:38.720
There's something I need to tell you.

28:38.753 --> 28:41.690
Between me and you.

28:41.723 --> 28:43.558
The night your dad was killed...

28:43.592 --> 28:45.159
Yeah?

28:46.661 --> 28:49.063
Lenny told me to keep you
in that club no matter what.

28:50.565 --> 28:52.033
Say that again.

28:52.066 --> 28:54.068
I just needed to tell ya.

28:54.102 --> 28:57.438
- Guess now I'll go, mate.
- You go.

29:02.677 --> 29:05.947
Jack. Jack?

30:13.615 --> 30:16.551
Sam, listen, I've just had it
with Lenny's firm.

30:16.585 --> 30:18.019
You need to get to my house now.

30:18.052 --> 30:19.554
I'm on my way.

30:33.067 --> 30:34.803
- What happened?
- I'm okay.

30:34.836 --> 30:36.236
- Are you okay?
- I'm all right. I'm all right.

30:36.237 --> 30:38.239
Calm down, listen to me.
We need to leave here now.

30:38.272 --> 30:40.341
What?

30:40.374 --> 30:43.014
Get back in the house. Grab our
passports and a bag for both of us.

30:53.354 --> 30:56.057
I got here as soon
as I could. You all right?

30:56.090 --> 30:57.257
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm all right.

30:57.258 --> 30:58.792
Listen, I've got to get
Nic away from here,

30:58.793 --> 31:01.295
can't be knocked down.
Do me a favor, get rid of that.

31:01.329 --> 31:03.765
Get that motor back
to one of the lockups.

31:03.798 --> 31:04.833
Jack.

31:04.866 --> 31:07.301
Get in Sammy's motor.
We're gonna take his car.

31:07.335 --> 31:09.971
- I'll call ya.
- Okay.

32:20.141 --> 32:21.843
When Ray gets here
and we all get settled,

32:21.876 --> 32:24.112
everything will be all right, I promise.

32:24.145 --> 32:27.648
One day...
One day it will.

32:30.885 --> 32:34.355
- Your guests are waiting for you.
- Thanks, Maria.

32:35.924 --> 32:40.361
- Jack. Nicole.
- There he is.

32:40.394 --> 32:41.895
I'm so sorry I wasn't here to meet you.

32:41.896 --> 32:44.132
Got away as quick as I could.

32:44.165 --> 32:45.333
Maria looked after ya?

32:45.366 --> 32:47.135
Yeah, mate, we are all good.
Thank you.

32:47.168 --> 32:49.470
Jack, it's lovely to see ya.

32:49.503 --> 32:51.339
Raymondo!

32:56.811 --> 32:58.412
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good, mate.

32:58.446 --> 32:59.981
All the better for seeing ya.

33:00.014 --> 33:02.150
Nicole, come here, come here.

33:05.987 --> 33:11.960
Listen, I don't want you worrying
about anything while you're here.

33:11.993 --> 33:14.462
- You hear me?
- Yeah, thanks.

33:14.495 --> 33:15.797
That's it.

33:15.830 --> 33:17.866
Actually, I'm not feeling too good.

33:17.899 --> 33:21.335
I think I'm gonna have a nice
long bath and lie down.

33:21.369 --> 33:22.336
Is that all right?

33:22.370 --> 33:25.106
Yeah, yeah.
If it makes you feel better.

33:25.139 --> 33:26.440
Yeah, okay.

33:26.474 --> 33:30.044
Maria, take Nicole up to
her room, would ya?

33:30.078 --> 33:32.781
There's all the stuff there.

33:32.814 --> 33:34.816
That must've shook her up.

33:34.849 --> 33:36.184
Yeah.

33:36.217 --> 33:39.420
Listen, Jack, the most important thing

33:39.453 --> 33:42.924
is you're here, you're both safe.

33:46.227 --> 33:49.197
The money is gone, Ray.

33:49.230 --> 33:52.767
And you know how important that
last little bit of work was to me.

33:52.801 --> 33:54.135
I know.

33:56.404 --> 33:58.339
What was he doing out here, Ray?

33:58.372 --> 34:00.842
Fucked if I know.

34:00.875 --> 34:03.511
You know I told you he phoned me,
but I wasn't here.

34:03.544 --> 34:06.247
I was in Gibraltar on business.
I said wait.

34:06.280 --> 34:08.817
Yeah, but he didn't, did he?
I'm surprised he didn't.

34:08.850 --> 34:11.552
Nah, he's...
I've been out here so long.

34:11.585 --> 34:14.155
You know, he's back in London.
It wasn't the same as the old days

34:14.188 --> 34:15.989
when we was running things together.

34:17.158 --> 34:18.126
Yeah.

34:18.159 --> 34:20.829
It fucking killed me
not getting to the funeral.

34:20.862 --> 34:23.831
Don't make 'em like that anymore, mate.

34:23.864 --> 34:26.801
Did you know that they tortured him?

34:26.835 --> 34:28.101
Before they shot him for the money.

34:28.101 --> 34:32.072
- Did you know that?
- Yeah.

34:32.106 --> 34:34.342
I still got a fucking
deep pain right in here

34:34.375 --> 34:35.495
every time I think about it.

34:35.509 --> 34:40.982
Jack, I'm on it.
I'll give you my word.

34:41.014 --> 34:42.483
How did they know, huh?

34:42.516 --> 34:46.387
I mean, how did they know the money
was there at that time that night?

34:46.420 --> 34:49.190
I keep asking myself the same question.

34:49.223 --> 34:51.159
I've got to find that girl.
I've got to find her.

34:51.192 --> 34:53.360
All day, I keep ringing her.
She won't pick up. I gotta find her.

34:53.360 --> 34:56.496
Do you need that egg on top of all this?

34:56.530 --> 34:59.067
- Forget her.
- Right, my dad's dead.

34:59.100 --> 35:00.500
And me and Nicole, we're lucky to be...

35:00.501 --> 35:02.170
we are lucky to fucking be alive.

35:02.203 --> 35:04.404
She's the only one that knows
anything about what's happening.

35:04.405 --> 35:05.840
So I can't just fucking forget her.

35:05.874 --> 35:09.610
Yeah, all right, calm down.
I'm on your side.

35:09.643 --> 35:13.614
Remember? But you killed two
geezers in broad fucking daylight.

35:13.647 --> 35:15.984
- That's not gonna go away.
- It was fuckin self defense.

35:16.017 --> 35:18.019
Yeah, I'm not saying you're wrong.

35:18.052 --> 35:21.555
But you've gotta remember
how important Lenny is.

35:21.589 --> 35:25.426
It's like a house of cards.
You pull one away, it all falls to fuck.

35:25.459 --> 35:27.161
All right, do me a fucking favor.

35:27.195 --> 35:29.062
The man's a no good dog
cunt monger who's got to go.

35:29.063 --> 35:30.097
You know that more than anybody.

35:30.098 --> 35:34.068
Yeah, and he will.
But we've got to do it proper.

35:35.203 --> 35:36.470
Yeah?

35:37.605 --> 35:41.910
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

35:41.943 --> 35:45.179
Look, I've gotta go.
I've got a meeting.

35:45.213 --> 35:47.248
Might be of benefit to both of us.
All right?

35:47.281 --> 35:48.582
- Go on, go.
- Yeah.

35:48.616 --> 35:50.418
- I'll see ya for breakfast, yeah?
- Yeah.

35:50.451 --> 35:52.653
- Full English?
- Yeah.

36:06.968 --> 36:10.338
Well, well. If that sordid
little secret gets out,

36:10.371 --> 36:12.606
it could really put a cat
amongst the pigeons.

36:14.142 --> 36:16.044
Good work, Mason.

36:36.264 --> 36:39.533
Aye, aye. Comin' in.

36:41.535 --> 36:45.673
I never get tired of looking at that.
How lucky are we?

36:45.706 --> 36:50.511
Look...
What fucking life, eh?

36:51.679 --> 36:53.581
What a country.

36:55.383 --> 36:57.151
Should I stay, Ray?

36:58.419 --> 37:00.288
When I look at all this...

37:00.321 --> 37:05.226
It really makes you think about
starting a new life. A fresh start.

37:05.259 --> 37:06.727
Getting away from all this shit,

37:06.760 --> 37:08.963
getting away from
everything with Nicole.

37:08.997 --> 37:09.929
It's always been her dream.

37:09.930 --> 37:12.666
You know I'll do
everything I can to help.

37:12.700 --> 37:15.469
Yeah, I know that.

37:18.439 --> 37:21.409
Life, eh? It's funny.

37:21.442 --> 37:24.445
You never know what the next day holds.

37:24.478 --> 37:26.180
Yeah, tell me about it.

37:26.214 --> 37:28.416
What will be, and all that.

37:28.449 --> 37:32.186
You being here.
Everything that's happened.

37:33.321 --> 37:34.222
I'm not with you.

37:34.255 --> 37:37.291
Well, let's just say
something's come my way.

37:37.325 --> 37:38.692
You know, something a bit special.

37:38.726 --> 37:42.263
- How do you mean?
- A job.

37:42.296 --> 37:45.633
Playing something
to set you up for life.

37:45.666 --> 37:49.603
We've been workin' at it
forever, all right?

37:49.637 --> 37:51.972
This one's the right time.

37:53.307 --> 37:54.775
What are you saying to me, Ray?

37:54.808 --> 37:58.446
I want you to have it.
You to do it.

37:58.479 --> 38:02.283
This is a big one, you've been
waiting your life for.

38:02.316 --> 38:04.685
I'm done with all that.

38:04.718 --> 38:07.088
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

38:08.722 --> 38:11.392
Let me ask you a question.

38:11.425 --> 38:13.527
If you start a new life out here...

38:15.163 --> 38:19.333
How you gonna live?
Survive?

38:19.367 --> 38:22.470
Can't stay with me forever.
You can't go home.

38:22.503 --> 38:25.739
- And you'll always feel mad.
- And you're not listening to me.

38:25.773 --> 38:27.708
I said I'm done with all of that.

38:27.741 --> 38:30.478
The only thing on my mind now

38:30.511 --> 38:34.315
is finding the men involved
in killing my dad.

38:34.348 --> 38:36.584
- And we will.
- Yeah, we will.

38:36.617 --> 38:39.387
And you mark my fucking words,
I'm going to kill every last one.

38:40.688 --> 38:42.590
I believe you.

38:43.791 --> 38:46.627
Look, just think about it.

38:46.660 --> 38:49.563
That's all I'm saying.

38:49.597 --> 38:52.466
Anyway...

38:52.500 --> 38:56.237
You need some, just a little bit?
To hold you over?

38:56.270 --> 38:58.506
Yeah, wait and see how he
throws everything you ask him.

38:58.539 --> 39:01.242
Yeah, no, you're there, son. Right.

39:01.275 --> 39:03.077
We'll take the motor
down to the old town

39:03.111 --> 39:05.679
and get some out for you then. Yeah?

39:05.713 --> 39:07.448
Yeah.

39:38.312 --> 39:39.580
You're gonna love this place.

39:39.613 --> 39:43.284
Low profile.
No questions asked.

39:43.317 --> 39:45.319
When you do get that big number,

39:45.353 --> 39:47.288
this is the place for a bit of fallback.

40:03.771 --> 40:07.708
Maria, could you give my
friend another brandy, please?

40:07.741 --> 40:10.311
- Nightcap, dear?
- No, I've had enough.

40:10.344 --> 40:12.580
- Sure?
- Yeah, I'm gonna have an early night.

40:12.613 --> 40:16.184
Leave you two boys to chat.

40:16.217 --> 40:18.718
Listen, we'll have one little drink
with me mate, and then I'll be up.

40:18.719 --> 40:20.688
Okay. Don't be too long.

40:21.722 --> 40:23.357
- Nite.
- Good night, my love.

40:24.425 --> 40:28.629
Just you and me.

40:28.662 --> 40:31.599
Listen, Ray...

40:31.632 --> 40:34.668
I haven't had a chance to say to you

40:34.702 --> 40:36.636
how much I appreciate
everything you've done for us.

40:36.637 --> 40:40.574
Oh, you forget it.
Because I love you.

40:41.642 --> 40:42.910
You're family to me.

40:44.778 --> 40:48.182
Still, nice to know
I'm fucking appreciated.

40:48.216 --> 40:50.684
- No, but, I'm being serious.
- I know. I know.

40:50.718 --> 40:51.752
Thanks.

40:52.520 --> 40:54.622
Ah, thanks, Maria.

40:54.655 --> 40:56.224
- Gracias.
- Cheers.

40:57.791 --> 41:01.429
- Cheers, son, for the offer.
- All the best.

41:06.900 --> 41:10.604
Listen, on a more serious subject,

41:10.638 --> 41:13.641
have you had a chance to think
about that little chat we had?

41:15.409 --> 41:18.212
Do me a favor, yeah?

41:18.246 --> 41:20.448
Put yourself in my position
for five minutes.

41:20.481 --> 41:25.185
Oh, I have. That's why we're
having this little chat.

41:26.520 --> 41:29.723
That job needs done
and it needs done now.

41:29.757 --> 41:31.859
And you're the man to do it.

41:37.598 --> 41:38.666
Sam.

41:38.699 --> 41:41.635
Jack, I found out where Holly is.

41:41.669 --> 41:42.587
Where?

41:42.589 --> 41:45.340
She's working in a club
over there down by the pool.

41:45.373 --> 41:48.376
- I'll text you the name of it.
- Thanks.

41:57.918 --> 41:59.887
Ray, I need a favor.
Can I borrow your motor?

41:59.920 --> 42:02.823
Yeah, of course you can.
The keys are in it.

42:02.856 --> 42:04.992
- You all right?
- I'll see you later.

42:23.411 --> 42:24.678
Sam.

42:24.712 --> 42:27.381
Jack, I found out
something about your old man

42:27.415 --> 42:28.515
and what he was doing out there.

42:28.516 --> 42:31.051
That girl on his phone,
her name is Holly Harris.

42:31.084 --> 42:32.920
It's Freddy Harris' granddaughter.

42:32.953 --> 42:34.888
Freddy Harris?

42:36.757 --> 42:39.527
He was one of Ray's and my
old man's closest pals.

42:39.560 --> 42:42.663
They used to run
Southeast London together.

42:42.696 --> 42:45.333
Him and his boy, Marc, were
murdered about five year ago,

42:45.366 --> 42:47.568
and no one ever found out who done 'em.

42:47.601 --> 42:49.703
So Ray must know who she is.

42:49.737 --> 42:51.372
The name of the club I sent ya,

42:51.405 --> 42:53.774
that's where she used
to meet your old man.

42:53.807 --> 42:56.644
Cheers. Listen, I'll call
you as soon as I can.

43:20.701 --> 43:22.035
Enjoy.

43:22.069 --> 43:24.505
Hi, my name is Rachael, can I help you?

43:24.538 --> 43:27.375
- Yeah. I need a word.
- What can I get you?

43:27.408 --> 43:29.743
I'm looking for a British girl.
Her name's Holly Harris

43:29.777 --> 43:31.177
and I was told that she worked here.

43:31.178 --> 43:33.914
Last couple of weeks we have been
seeing her a lot with this man.

43:33.947 --> 43:36.784
Why don't you find
a seat and relax. Okay?

43:36.817 --> 43:40.521
- Hi, guys, what can I get you?
- Two small vodkas, please.

43:40.554 --> 43:43.557
Listen, look, you tell me what I
need to know and that's yours.

43:45.092 --> 43:49.329
Okay, yes, I know her, and she's
in here all the time. So what?

44:01.475 --> 44:04.678
- Don't walk away from me.
- This area is out of bounds.

44:04.712 --> 44:06.447
I'm calling security right this second.

44:06.480 --> 44:09.149
Don't you come near me.
You dare touch me...

44:09.182 --> 44:10.551
Rachael, please.

44:10.584 --> 44:13.487
- I really need to find her.
- Why?

44:13.521 --> 44:15.756
I need her help.
I need to talk to her.

44:15.789 --> 44:18.759
The man in that picture
was my dad and he was murdered.

44:20.861 --> 44:22.563
Look, she's a close friend of mine

44:22.596 --> 44:24.030
and I don't want her
getting into any trouble.

44:24.031 --> 44:27.668
She won't get into any
trouble, I promise.

44:27.701 --> 44:29.803
I just really need to talk to her.

44:29.837 --> 44:34.007
Look, take my number and call
me if she comes back in here.

44:35.776 --> 44:38.846
I won't have to.
She's in here now.

44:38.879 --> 44:43.016
Champagne bar, red dress.
Can't miss her.

44:44.685 --> 44:45.886
Thanks.

45:01.769 --> 45:02.803
Oi!

45:35.536 --> 45:38.105
Hi, this is Holly.
Please leave a message.

45:38.138 --> 45:40.508
Holly, please don't run.

45:40.541 --> 45:42.943
Just call me back on this
number, it's really important.

45:42.976 --> 45:44.712
I just need to talk to ya.

45:49.016 --> 45:51.719
Yeah, all right. All right.

45:51.752 --> 45:53.053
I did know Holly.

45:53.086 --> 45:56.256
She's been out here a couple of times.

45:56.289 --> 45:59.593
She put it on me for some help.
She needed work.

45:59.627 --> 46:00.993
I got her a little job at the club.

46:00.994 --> 46:02.630
So why the fuck didn't you say so?

46:02.663 --> 46:04.532
Because I didn't want
this getting out of hand.

46:04.565 --> 46:06.199
Ray, she knows something.

46:06.233 --> 46:08.869
She took one look at me and bolted.

46:08.902 --> 46:11.539
Well, from what you just
told me a lot of people did.

46:11.572 --> 46:13.541
And you're meant to be
keeping a low profile.

46:13.574 --> 46:17.210
Her granddad was Freddy Harris,
one of your best pals.

46:17.244 --> 46:19.246
Him and his boy, Marc, were murdered.

46:19.279 --> 46:21.949
Now I'm asking you,
man-to-man, as a mate.

46:21.982 --> 46:24.051
Is that what all of this is about?

46:25.218 --> 46:28.021
He was a slag sniffhead.

46:28.055 --> 46:29.957
He'd have turned on a sixpence.

46:29.990 --> 46:33.561
And his boy was just the fucking same.

46:33.594 --> 46:37.865
Now who killed him is anyone's guess,
but I tell you this...

46:37.898 --> 46:41.569
They made a lot of fucking enemies.

46:41.602 --> 46:44.838
Then we found out the boy
left the door open for Holly

46:44.872 --> 46:47.575
and me and Alfie looked after her.

46:47.608 --> 46:49.009
For what?

46:49.042 --> 46:51.579
'Cause it's the right thing to do.

46:51.612 --> 46:55.816
That's the kind of geezer
your old man was.

46:55.849 --> 47:00.821
He paid for everything.
School, the lot.

47:00.854 --> 47:03.824
He was just looking out
for her, that's all.

47:03.857 --> 47:07.194
Why on earth didn't you tell me
all this when I first got here?

47:07.227 --> 47:08.829
Ray, I just want to know

47:08.862 --> 47:11.063
why they keep calling each other
all the time. That's all.

47:11.064 --> 47:14.768
You know what?
You make me fucking laugh.

47:14.802 --> 47:18.005
You just do not listen!

47:18.038 --> 47:21.642
You're meant to be keeping
a low profile. What are you doing?

47:21.675 --> 47:25.579
You're running around here,
making yourself fucking busy!

47:31.051 --> 47:32.920
You know something?
You're right.

47:34.187 --> 47:37.891
I'm out of order and I'm sorry.

48:00.881 --> 48:01.915
Holly!

48:01.949 --> 48:04.284
Jack, I'm sorry about running,

48:04.317 --> 48:05.418
but I had no choice.

48:05.452 --> 48:08.288
I wanted to call you, but I was scared.

48:08.321 --> 48:11.291
Listen to me. You've got
nothing to be scared of.

48:11.324 --> 48:13.126
I just need to talk to you.

48:13.160 --> 48:14.361
I just need your help.
Please.

48:14.394 --> 48:18.265
I know you do, and I do want
to help you. It's just that...

48:18.298 --> 48:20.768
If he finds out,
he's going to come after me.

48:20.801 --> 48:23.971
- If who finds out?
- I can't tell you over the phone.

48:24.004 --> 48:25.806
It has to be in person, away from here.

48:25.839 --> 48:28.175
Holly, look, do me a favor.
Meet me right now.

48:28.208 --> 48:30.210
I can't. I'm leaving for London.

48:30.243 --> 48:31.244
It's safer for me there.

48:31.278 --> 48:33.914
Can you meet me when you get back?

48:33.947 --> 48:36.083
It's a little bit difficult
for me at the moment.

48:36.116 --> 48:38.251
Look, let me try and work something out

48:38.285 --> 48:40.286
and I'll call you on this
number as soon as I get back.

48:40.287 --> 48:44.958
Jack, I know the real reason
Alfie was killed.

48:44.992 --> 48:49.797
- It wasn't for the money.
- What did you say?

48:49.830 --> 48:51.799
What did you say again?
What did you say?

48:57.938 --> 49:01.274
Hi, this is Holly.
Please leave a message.

49:01.308 --> 49:02.976
Holly, don't put me on voice-mail.

49:03.010 --> 49:05.412
Call me back.
Call me straight back.

49:16.389 --> 49:17.791
I want it.

49:19.960 --> 49:22.262
I knew you'd change your mind.

49:22.295 --> 49:23.897
Boy...

49:27.334 --> 49:29.937
Ray Dixon...

49:29.970 --> 49:33.206
Master draftsman. We got a file
on him three inches thick.

49:33.240 --> 49:35.909
Fat little good that's
done us the last 15 years.

49:35.943 --> 49:41.248
Everybody wants him extradited,
but I want Jack Cregan,

49:41.281 --> 49:43.817
and his merry gang of piss takers.

49:43.851 --> 49:48.221
We take them down, one of them will
roll over and then we get Ray.

49:48.255 --> 49:52.025
We take down the monkey
to get to the organ grinder.

49:52.059 --> 49:55.362
Now a source tells me
they're gonna surface soon.

49:55.395 --> 49:59.032
So, I want court orders
on delivery schedules

49:59.066 --> 50:01.902
to all major security transportations.

50:01.935 --> 50:04.070
Should we stick with freight to
London or extend to the Southeast?

50:04.071 --> 50:05.405
All of the Southeast.

50:05.438 --> 50:06.606
Check out the routes

50:06.639 --> 50:09.042
and find out how much money
they carry in these places.

50:09.076 --> 50:12.379
It will be a big score
and don't bother with banks.

50:12.412 --> 50:14.481
They are gonna stay low profile.

50:14.514 --> 50:18.385
They know that there's much
more money in these depots.

50:21.021 --> 50:22.981
Well, what you looking
at me for? You want a song?

50:22.990 --> 50:26.093
- Fuckin' get on with it!
- Yes, sir.

50:33.333 --> 50:35.836
- This is it.
- When?

50:35.869 --> 50:38.038
Day after tomorrow.

50:38.071 --> 50:39.671
You're having
a fucking laugh, ain't you?

50:40.507 --> 50:42.009
No, I'm not.

50:43.243 --> 50:45.445
We just got the inside on it a week ago.

50:45.478 --> 50:48.248
This changes everything.

50:49.382 --> 50:51.384
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

50:54.421 --> 50:57.124
Ray, this is old school.

50:57.157 --> 50:58.826
We're on the pavement here.

50:58.859 --> 51:00.392
I'm telling you now,
I'm being honest with ya.

51:00.393 --> 51:01.962
It's not about me.

51:01.995 --> 51:05.298
Wrap up. Follow the drill.
Upgrade your hardware.

51:05.332 --> 51:07.567
Trust me, when you find out

51:07.600 --> 51:11.138
how much money this place is holding,
you're gonna change your tune.

51:19.146 --> 51:22.816
The passport I've given you will get
you in and out under the radar.

51:24.384 --> 51:27.520
Call the number in the mobile
when you get there.

51:27.554 --> 51:30.490
I'll contact you with all the details.

51:32.192 --> 51:35.896
I'll call Eddie.
Get you tooled up.

51:37.297 --> 51:38.431
Look after Nic for me.

51:40.467 --> 51:44.037
I'll look after her.
Don't worry.

53:01.314 --> 53:03.116
DCI Wickstead.

53:20.200 --> 53:21.368
Mason!

53:24.704 --> 53:28.375
- Sir.
- Get me two CO-19 armed response units

53:28.408 --> 53:29.509
on constant standby.

53:29.542 --> 53:31.011
I'll put a call in now, sir.

53:31.044 --> 53:32.644
- Give them the green light.
- Thank you.

53:44.757 --> 53:47.094
Here you go, sir.
Keep the change.

54:09.016 --> 54:10.417
- You Cregan?
- Yeah.

54:10.450 --> 54:13.053
Here's exact numbers and
delivery times for tomorrow.

54:13.086 --> 54:14.321
Good.

54:34.141 --> 54:35.742
What the fuck is wrong with you?

54:38.578 --> 54:41.648
I thought the NCA and half the
metropolitan police are after ya.

54:41.681 --> 54:44.051
You expect me to take this seriously?

54:44.084 --> 54:45.585
We need to talk, Jack.

54:45.618 --> 54:47.220
There is nothing to talk about.

54:47.254 --> 54:50.323
- Everything is sorted.
- And how'd you work that out?

54:50.357 --> 54:52.325
Because Ray has got a face on the inside

54:52.359 --> 54:54.294
and I've been all over it.
That's why.

54:56.129 --> 54:59.199
We aren't up for it, Jack,
and you know it.

54:59.232 --> 55:02.502
Sam, we can do this.

55:02.535 --> 55:04.304
All we got to do

55:04.337 --> 55:06.806
is play by the rules and the
info, and we're all good.

55:06.839 --> 55:10.277
Listen to yourself, mate.
Don't you get it?

55:10.310 --> 55:11.478
You're still running around

55:11.511 --> 55:13.792
and trying to get our last bit
of money back and now this.

55:13.813 --> 55:16.583
All this because you wanted
to be like your dad.

55:16.616 --> 55:18.818
Let me tell you something.

55:18.851 --> 55:23.790
The money is gone
and that game is over, Jack.

55:23.823 --> 55:26.693
It's dead.
Just like Alfie.

55:26.726 --> 55:31.164
Don't you fucking say that.
Don't you fucking ever say that.

55:32.665 --> 55:35.202
I've loved you more like a
brother than like a cousin

55:35.235 --> 55:36.803
all these years looking after you.

55:36.836 --> 55:39.806
Can't strong it with me, Sammy.

55:39.839 --> 55:43.610
We go in there now
and it's a death sentence.

55:43.643 --> 55:46.646
It needs prep, Jack.

55:46.679 --> 55:50.783
Our preparation.
My preparation.

55:52.018 --> 55:55.322
I've been running about all day
like a fucking lunatic.

55:55.355 --> 55:57.757
Ray only called me
on this, this morning.

55:57.790 --> 56:01.594
- What's happening?
- We're going back to work.

56:01.628 --> 56:03.263
I thought all this was over.

56:05.298 --> 56:08.535
Oh, please, don't give us the
fucking silent treatment.

56:08.568 --> 56:11.204
- What do you want me to say?
- This is no good, Jack.

56:11.238 --> 56:13.673
We're asking for trouble.

56:13.706 --> 56:17.076
Let's just go ahead.
Leave it.

56:18.711 --> 56:23.383
Hold on a minute, Frank.
Hold on one minute.

56:25.752 --> 56:30.657
Look, I know I said
we'd never do this again,

56:30.690 --> 56:33.593
but I'm telling you now,
this one is special.

56:33.626 --> 56:36.429
We are looking at 30 each,
if we get it done now.

56:36.463 --> 56:40.300
Yeah, and I don't even want to think
about the other fucking option.

56:40.333 --> 56:42.735
He's right.
And you know he is right.

56:44.371 --> 56:47.774
This needs to happen
and it needs to happen now.

56:52.545 --> 56:54.447
Look,

56:54.481 --> 56:58.585
I can't and I won't let my
dad's killing be for nothing.

56:58.618 --> 57:00.753
Just take a moment, one moment,

57:00.787 --> 57:05.658
think about all the times that he
was there for you over the years.

57:05.692 --> 57:09.262
You know he was.
I'm telling you now,

57:09.296 --> 57:11.198
this cack is loaded to the fucking brim.

57:11.231 --> 57:14.801
If we're serious,
and I mean really serious

57:14.834 --> 57:17.470
about ending all this, once and for all,

57:18.905 --> 57:20.207
then this is it.

57:26.913 --> 57:31.951
Okay, this is the main foreign
currency depot in Canary Wharf.

57:31.984 --> 57:36.889
It feeds every major currency exchange
center right across the city of London.

57:36.923 --> 57:41.761
It's private, discreet, and
accessed by only one door.

57:41.794 --> 57:45.198
There are minimal guards
inside, but the whole place

57:45.232 --> 57:49.569
is monitored with CCTV and direct
armed response panic alarms,

57:49.602 --> 57:52.705
which we ain't got time
to do anything about.

57:52.739 --> 57:55.708
Now this place has never been hit.

57:55.742 --> 58:00.313
So were gonna go in hard with noise
and surprise and get out quick.

58:00.347 --> 58:02.415
Eddie will drop us off at the perimeter.

58:02.449 --> 58:05.452
He'll meet us at the other side through
the basement at the exit point.

58:06.986 --> 58:09.222
We cut through the fence
at the dead spot

58:09.256 --> 58:11.491
marked exactly on the plans.

58:13.326 --> 58:15.662
Dead on six, the doors will open

58:15.695 --> 58:18.765
and the security van
will pull up and drive inside.

58:20.567 --> 58:22.302
One guard will get out.

58:22.335 --> 58:25.272
One stays behind,
leaving the engine running.

58:25.305 --> 58:27.807
Two guards will take the money
to the loading bay.

58:27.840 --> 58:31.778
This is where we've got
to be lively but careful.

58:31.811 --> 58:36.683
It takes 60 seconds for the money to
be transferred into the building.

58:36.716 --> 58:39.919
Like I said, we get the money
when it's moving

58:39.952 --> 58:42.422
and we are marked.

58:50.397 --> 58:52.799
You, put your head down!

58:54.334 --> 58:55.668
Hands!

58:59.806 --> 59:02.275
Keys! Floor!

59:03.476 --> 59:05.244
Don't move!

59:10.617 --> 59:12.952
Don't you fucking look at me!

59:19.426 --> 59:20.827
We good?

59:22.028 --> 59:23.896
We're good.

59:25.498 --> 59:28.601
I said, don't you fucking move!

59:32.672 --> 59:36.042
- Which way Jack? Which way?
- It's on the left. On the left.

59:37.577 --> 59:39.612
Go, don't stop!

59:53.460 --> 59:54.561
Go!

01:00:14.714 --> 01:00:16.549
You'll be all right.

01:00:19.819 --> 01:00:21.754
Go! Go! Go!

01:00:43.142 --> 01:00:44.844
Mason!

01:00:49.449 --> 01:00:50.917
Frank!

01:00:53.586 --> 01:00:54.954
Frank!

01:00:57.156 --> 01:00:59.692
Cregan!

01:00:59.726 --> 01:01:01.894
Cregan, the game's up!

01:01:08.868 --> 01:01:10.770
Sam, move!

01:01:26.218 --> 01:01:27.687
Get up!

01:01:41.834 --> 01:01:47.006
Show me your hands!
Show your fucking hands!

01:02:19.939 --> 01:02:22.642
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

01:02:22.675 --> 01:02:24.644
Don't worry about it.
We're gonna fucking go.

01:02:24.677 --> 01:02:28.114
Just go. Just fucking go on.
I'm fucked, mate. You go.

01:02:28.147 --> 01:02:30.750
Just go. Just go, Jack.

01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:35.154
Suspect spotted.

01:02:35.187 --> 01:02:36.867
Can't leave the rear
of building stairwell.

01:02:38.224 --> 01:02:39.992
Stay here. Stay here.

01:02:44.931 --> 01:02:47.734
We are under fire.
Repeat. We are under fire.

01:02:49.101 --> 01:02:50.970
Taking evasive action.

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:56.736
Get out! Get out of the car!

01:03:56.769 --> 01:04:01.040
Move. Move. Move.
Sammy, now.

01:04:18.357 --> 01:04:19.926
Sam!

01:04:42.715 --> 01:04:45.084
No, no, no!

01:04:45.685 --> 01:04:47.086
No!

01:05:01.233 --> 01:05:02.201
Identify suspect.

01:05:02.234 --> 01:05:05.037
Is it Cregan?
Repeat, is it Cregan?

01:05:05.071 --> 01:05:07.239
Negative, it's Sammy Colen.
Cregan is free.

01:05:09.375 --> 01:05:11.310
Don't lose him!

01:06:01.894 --> 01:06:04.396
The next stop is West India Quay.

01:06:14.306 --> 01:06:15.908
Hi.

01:06:15.942 --> 01:06:18.444
Holly, it's Jack.
I'm gonna text you an address.

01:06:18.477 --> 01:06:21.280
I'm gonna need you to meet
me there as soon as you can.

01:06:21.313 --> 01:06:24.050
- Now?
- As soon as you can.

01:07:05.224 --> 01:07:08.094
- Jack...
- Holly.

01:07:08.127 --> 01:07:09.929
Listen, I don't have much time,

01:07:09.962 --> 01:07:11.530
but you need to tell me what you know

01:07:11.563 --> 01:07:14.333
about what happened to my dad,
and you need to do it now.

01:07:14.366 --> 01:07:17.036
The night he was killed...

01:07:17.069 --> 01:07:20.506
your number was one of the
last numbers on his phone.

01:07:20.539 --> 01:07:24.543
He wanted to meet me. But he let
me down at the last minute.

01:07:24.576 --> 01:07:27.413
He said he had to meet someone else.

01:07:27.446 --> 01:07:31.818
My gran, Sheila, waited all
those years to get him back.

01:07:32.985 --> 01:07:34.821
It was her final wish.

01:07:36.388 --> 01:07:39.091
He killed my dad and my granddad.

01:07:39.125 --> 01:07:41.493
Who did?
What are you talking about?

01:07:43.395 --> 01:07:44.831
Ray.

01:07:46.398 --> 01:07:49.301
Ray Dixon.

01:07:49.335 --> 01:07:52.338
That's why I had to call you
and come back to London.

01:07:52.371 --> 01:07:54.540
It's not safe for me there anymore.

01:07:54.573 --> 01:07:57.443
He knows it was me who told Alfie.

01:07:57.476 --> 01:07:58.978
That's why Alfie went after me.

01:07:59.011 --> 01:08:00.511
He went crazy, he was going to kill Ray.

01:08:00.512 --> 01:08:02.982
Just slow down.

01:08:03.015 --> 01:08:06.018
Slow down and explain to me clearly.

01:08:07.019 --> 01:08:11.157
Alfie went out to Marbella to kill Ray.

01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:14.326
No, no, no.
No, you don't understand.

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:16.863
They grew up together.
They were best friends.

01:08:16.895 --> 01:08:19.966
- They loved each other.
- It's true.

01:08:19.999 --> 01:08:23.402
Alfie called me himself once
he got the confirmation.

01:08:23.435 --> 01:08:26.305
What do you mean, confirmation?
Confirmation of what?

01:08:29.308 --> 01:08:33.212
He's not your real father, Jack.

01:08:33.245 --> 01:08:35.381
Alfie is not your real father.

01:08:35.413 --> 01:08:37.884
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:08:37.917 --> 01:08:42.587
That's impossible.
That's a mistake and you're wrong.

01:08:42.621 --> 01:08:47.894
I wish I was.
Alfie gave me this.

01:08:47.926 --> 01:08:51.197
He said if anything happened to
him, I should give it to you.

01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:53.966
And you'd know what to do.

01:09:00.406 --> 01:09:03.009
Let me tell you something about my mom.

01:09:05.011 --> 01:09:10.182
My mom was obsessed with my dad...

01:09:11.483 --> 01:09:14.386
and she would never ever, ever
have gone behind his back.

01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:15.921
She was loyal.

01:09:15.955 --> 01:09:21.160
She didn't go behind his back, Jack.

01:09:22.127 --> 01:09:24.162
He raped her.

01:09:24.196 --> 01:09:29.135
My gran was her best friend,
the only person she ever told.

01:09:29.167 --> 01:09:32.638
I'm so sorry to be the one to tell you.

01:09:32.671 --> 01:09:35.374
Can't be true.
That's not true.

01:09:35.407 --> 01:09:37.209
- Can't be true.
- It's true.

01:09:39.145 --> 01:09:42.048
Ray Dixon is your real father.

01:09:42.081 --> 01:09:43.381
No...

01:09:44.515 --> 01:09:47.519
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:09:47.553 --> 01:09:50.022
Ray is behind everything.

01:09:50.055 --> 01:09:53.524
It was Ray who ordered Lenny
Moore to kill your dad.

01:09:55.127 --> 01:09:57.563
You need to leave here, Holly.

01:09:57.596 --> 01:09:59.598
You need to go.

01:10:05.671 --> 01:10:07.974
I'm so sorry.

01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:50.182
Hi, this is Nicole.

01:10:50.216 --> 01:10:51.649
Leave me a message
and I'll get back to you.

01:10:52.985 --> 01:10:58.424
Nic, listen to me carefully.
You need to stay calm and don't panic.

01:10:58.457 --> 01:11:02.094
You need to get out of the villa
and get away from Ray, now.

01:11:02.128 --> 01:11:03.562
Just get out of there.

01:11:23.482 --> 01:11:24.616
Excuse me, sir.

01:11:38.230 --> 01:11:40.198
- Where's the fucking money you nicked?
- What money?

01:11:40.199 --> 01:11:43.202
The fucking money, you cunt.
Where is it?

01:11:44.836 --> 01:11:48.274
Where is it? 'Cause I ain't
gonna fucking ask you again.

01:11:48.307 --> 01:11:49.775
Now, where is it?

01:11:53.245 --> 01:11:54.646
Now, where is it?

01:11:55.647 --> 01:11:58.584
In the bag behind the fridge.

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:05.357
I know it was you. I know
it was you who killed my dad.

01:12:12.464 --> 01:12:15.634
You ain't got it in ya.
You're just like your old man.

01:12:15.667 --> 01:12:17.169
Weak!

01:12:20.139 --> 01:12:21.807
This is for Alfie, you cunt.

01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:07.519
Neil, don't talk, just listen to me.
It's Jack Cregan.

01:13:07.553 --> 01:13:09.788
That favor you owe me,
I'm calling it now.

01:13:09.821 --> 01:13:12.324
I need your men standing
by in half an hour.

01:13:12.358 --> 01:13:14.293
We'll meet up in the usual way.

01:13:14.326 --> 01:13:16.795
Listen to me carefully,
this is what I need.

01:13:16.828 --> 01:13:18.464
Change of plan.
Lenny's dead.

01:13:18.497 --> 01:13:21.167
Cregan has made
a right fucking mess of it.

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:23.902
He's on his way to Spain, and I
don't know how much he knows.

01:13:23.935 --> 01:13:26.672
Don't worry, I'll get him.

01:13:26.705 --> 01:13:29.875
Well, you should be
fucking worried about it!

01:14:22.228 --> 01:14:24.896
Get away from Ray, now.
Just get out of there.

01:15:25.424 --> 01:15:27.225
Nicole.

01:15:29.661 --> 01:15:30.996
Nicole.

01:16:42.634 --> 01:16:47.939
- Get out of the car.
- Please. Please, Ray. Let me go.

01:16:58.850 --> 01:17:00.952
Back to the house.

01:18:17.095 --> 01:18:18.764
That's close enough.

01:18:21.166 --> 01:18:22.734
Where's Nicole?

01:18:23.635 --> 01:18:27.473
Don't worry. She's safe.

01:18:28.507 --> 01:18:29.908
Where is she?

01:18:33.244 --> 01:18:35.647
I tried to protect you, son.

01:18:35.681 --> 01:18:37.549
Protect me?

01:18:37.583 --> 01:18:41.219
You fucking set me up. They were
sitting there waiting for us.

01:18:41.252 --> 01:18:46.424
Frank and Sammy are both dead.

01:18:48.527 --> 01:18:51.096
You should have stayed out of this.

01:18:52.931 --> 01:18:54.633
Holly told me everything.

01:18:56.001 --> 01:18:57.769
What did Holly tell ya?

01:18:57.803 --> 01:19:00.472
That my whole life...

01:19:02.541 --> 01:19:04.042
My whole has been a lie.

01:19:09.781 --> 01:19:11.883
I was gonna tell ya.

01:19:14.686 --> 01:19:16.555
You have to believe me.

01:19:19.224 --> 01:19:20.959
You raped my mom.

01:19:22.027 --> 01:19:23.795
You raped her.

01:19:24.863 --> 01:19:27.499
She lived her whole life...

01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:32.638
scared and worried

01:19:32.671 --> 01:19:35.841
about what would happen if it come out.

01:19:37.108 --> 01:19:39.210
I loved your mum.

01:19:43.314 --> 01:19:45.951
He thought I was his.

01:19:47.953 --> 01:19:50.255
You destroyed him.

01:19:50.288 --> 01:19:52.858
Like you destroyed me.

01:19:55.126 --> 01:19:57.128
Do you realize what you've done?

01:19:57.162 --> 01:20:02.200
Do you actually fucking realize
what you've done to me?

01:20:02.233 --> 01:20:06.271
To my life? To my family?

01:20:06.304 --> 01:20:09.908
He was comin' after me.
It was him or me.

01:20:09.941 --> 01:20:12.644
But you didn't have to kill him, Ray.

01:20:18.884 --> 01:20:20.819
You look at me.

01:20:22.754 --> 01:20:24.856
We're the same.

01:20:24.890 --> 01:20:29.294
You and me, we're blood.

01:20:30.328 --> 01:20:34.666
What's in me is in you.

01:20:35.366 --> 01:20:38.904
No. No.

01:20:38.937 --> 01:20:42.908
I'm nothing like you.

01:20:55.921 --> 01:20:56.988
Jack...

01:20:59.825 --> 01:21:01.660
Don't do this.

01:21:05.697 --> 01:21:08.066
You can't kill your father.

01:21:08.099 --> 01:21:11.970
My father is dead.
You killed him and I buried him.

01:21:21.212 --> 01:21:22.948
Jack!

01:21:30.421 --> 01:21:34.660
Nic, it's all right.
It's all right.

01:21:37.763 --> 01:21:39.064
Look at me.

01:21:40.431 --> 01:21:44.670
It's over.
It's all over.

01:22:13.264 --> 01:22:17.035
What are you doing?
Why we stopping here?

01:22:17.068 --> 01:22:18.670
Ray's deposit box.

01:22:19.871 --> 01:22:22.407
Don't, please.
Let's just go, Jack.

01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:25.076
Please, for me.
We don't need it.

01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:28.279
Listen to me, Nic.
We do.

01:22:33.284 --> 01:22:36.988
- I love you. You know that.
- I love you, too.

01:23:43.221 --> 01:23:44.790
Gracias.

01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:11.016
Gotcha!

01:24:28.299 --> 01:24:30.201
What are you fucking doing here?

01:24:31.202 --> 01:24:33.538
I'm doing my fucking job!

01:24:33.571 --> 01:24:35.440
With or without a cause.

01:24:37.275 --> 01:24:39.044
Couldn't find a way in, see?

01:24:39.077 --> 01:24:40.912
Couldn't get a grass.

01:24:40.946 --> 01:24:43.114
And then something lands on my lap.

01:24:43.148 --> 01:24:46.151
Sordid little story from your family.

01:24:47.585 --> 01:24:51.389
Ray Dixon is your real father.

01:24:51.422 --> 01:24:54.492
You fucking people.

01:24:54.525 --> 01:24:56.294
Now, Ray is a slippery fucker,

01:24:56.327 --> 01:24:59.130
so he came to me to cut a deal.

01:24:59.164 --> 01:25:03.501
If I call off the dogs,
stop the extradition,

01:25:03.534 --> 01:25:06.905
then he retires and
serves up Jack Cregan.

01:25:11.409 --> 01:25:13.344
I'm going to wet my beak with this

01:25:13.378 --> 01:25:16.047
because I fucking earned it.

01:25:17.415 --> 01:25:20.151
You see, Ray doesn't want you killed.

01:25:20.185 --> 01:25:23.154
You're is his son,
he's racked with guilt,

01:25:23.188 --> 01:25:26.457
but he wants you banged up
for a long time.

01:25:26.491 --> 01:25:28.559
Just for his safety.

01:25:29.527 --> 01:25:32.063
Why am I tellin' you all this?

01:25:34.399 --> 01:25:37.102
Because that was before
you started putting holes

01:25:37.135 --> 01:25:39.905
in hardworking fucking policemen!

01:25:39.938 --> 01:25:43.341
- Fuck Ray, and fuck his deal.
- Wickstead, I'm begging you.

01:25:43.374 --> 01:25:44.575
- Really?
- I'm begging you.

01:25:44.609 --> 01:25:47.045
I think you would stop resisting arrest.

01:25:47.078 --> 01:25:47.871
Help me.

01:25:47.873 --> 01:25:50.249
I think they'll give me a fucking medal.

01:25:50.281 --> 01:25:52.017
Family, Jack.

01:25:52.050 --> 01:25:55.320
- They really fucked you up.
- My dad.

01:25:55.353 --> 01:25:56.922
What's that?
What's that?

01:25:56.955 --> 01:25:59.390
- What's your last words, Jack?
- My dad!

01:29:13.384 --> 01:29:14.752
Fuck.

01:29:43.448 --> 01:29:45.550
Get out of the motor.
