I don't know about you, but I'm
the kind of person that can get

00:04.151 --> 00:07.492
99 positive comments and
then 40,000 negative ones

00:07.526 --> 00:09.061
and only focus on those.

00:10.532 --> 00:12.234
Why are we like that?

00:12.268 --> 00:14.506
[music]

00:17.311 --> 00:18.581
This is The Premise.

00:18.614 --> 00:23.023
I hope you enjoy it and if not,
I'm sure you'll know what to do.

00:23.791 --> 00:26.229
This is, "The Commenter."

00:42.428 --> 00:44.633
[birds chirping]

00:44.866 --> 00:47.438
You're exactly where
you're supposed to be.

00:55.688 --> 00:57.291
Keep your eyes closed...

00:58.326 --> 01:00.598
and focus on your breath.

01:02.167 --> 01:03.838
No other thoughts
enter your mind.

01:03.871 --> 01:05.140
[dog barking]

01:06.242 --> 01:10.050
The only sound you hear is
the sound of your breath.

01:11.319 --> 01:12.388
Breathe‐‐

01:14.626 --> 01:16.262
in for four,

01:16.296 --> 01:17.532
[wind chimes]

01:21.439 --> 01:23.678
out for four,

01:24.345 --> 01:26.282
and that's all you have to do.

01:27.752 --> 01:30.725
That's all you ever have to do.

01:31.527 --> 01:33.063
Now take your time.

01:33.798 --> 01:36.604
And when you're ready,
open your eyes.

01:39.308 --> 01:43.618
Congratulate yourself on
a meaningful practice today.

01:44.218 --> 01:45.354
Namaste.

01:47.391 --> 01:50.364
If you enjoyed your practice
please follow me on Instagram

Bang bang.

01:56.543 --> 01:57.812
[laughs]

01:58.246 --> 01:59.549
Hey, what are you doing?

01:59.583 --> 02:01.452
I'm teaching Bear to play dead.

02:01.486 --> 02:02.321
Bang, bang.

02:06.229 --> 02:08.567
Yay. Good Bear!

02:08.601 --> 02:09.903
With bang bang, Bear.

02:09.936 --> 02:11.105
[laughs]

02:12.241 --> 02:13.310
Seriously?

02:14.378 --> 02:18.654
Why are steel‐cut oats
healthier than other oats?

02:18.921 --> 02:20.658
I mean, how do
the oats even know

02:20.692 --> 02:21.927
what they're being cut with?

02:21.960 --> 02:23.564
I don't know,
but I think you're funny.

02:23.597 --> 02:24.465
[chuckles]

02:24.499 --> 02:26.469
But for real,
what is the difference?

02:26.503 --> 02:27.338
Mm‐hmm.

02:30.678 --> 02:32.481
What's this?

02:32.882 --> 02:34.285
[chuckles]

02:34.318 --> 02:35.722
Steel‐cut toast.

02:35.755 --> 02:38.159
Because you are‐‐

02:38.460 --> 02:41.734
Miss Generational Inspiration
and you deserve to be

02:41.967 --> 02:43.771
celebrating yourself
and who you are.

02:43.804 --> 02:45.307
‐ No, no, no.
‐ Absolutely...

02:45.340 --> 02:47.579
‐ Every single day.
‐ I'm so gross and sweaty now.

02:47.612 --> 02:49.248
Oh, it's not even a real award.

02:49.281 --> 02:51.185
They just gave it
to me for fundraising.

02:51.219 --> 02:51.820
Shhh...

02:51.854 --> 02:53.657
Can't I just love you?

02:53.691 --> 02:59.368
Just listen to your toast,
you are the fucking best.

02:59.402 --> 03:00.437
[laughs]

03:01.874 --> 03:03.911
I will see you tonight
with the girls, okay?

03:03.944 --> 03:04.746
Okay.

03:04.780 --> 03:07.752
You go change some lives.

03:08.253 --> 03:09.355
Have a good day.

03:09.589 --> 03:11.927
Bye. I love you.

03:11.960 --> 03:13.229
Je t'aime...

03:14.331 --> 03:15.902
All right, listen up ladies.

03:16.870 --> 03:20.210
I want you to close
your eyes because

03:20.678 --> 03:22.347
I'm about to blow your minds.

03:23.551 --> 03:26.189
Now keep your eyes closed...

03:26.389 --> 03:27.191
[laughs]

03:28.126 --> 03:31.365
and I want you to try
and scare yourself.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.938
Come on try.

03:34.539 --> 03:35.575
[chuckles]

03:36.543 --> 03:39.448
See, being scared of
yourself makes no sense.

03:39.482 --> 03:42.555
You just have to listen
to your inner voice.

03:42.989 --> 03:45.394
Now, when you write
this week's exercise,

03:45.427 --> 03:46.930
I want you to remember that

03:46.964 --> 03:49.301
there is no such thing
as perfect.

03:50.003 --> 03:52.274
There is only perfectly you.

03:52.474 --> 03:54.513
Let's show our appreciation.

03:54.546 --> 03:55.581
Huh?!

03:55.615 --> 03:58.721
We show! (clap) our! (clap)
great appreciation!

03:58.754 --> 04:02.327
for the heroes! (clap) who help!
our strength in education!

To Cleo.

04:29.850 --> 04:31.486
[applause]

04:32.087 --> 04:34.291
Also, to Naomi for
getting into her

04:34.325 --> 04:36.429
first choice medical school.

04:36.462 --> 04:37.632
‐ Come on.
‐ Killing it!

04:37.665 --> 04:38.968
[applause]

04:39.870 --> 04:42.775
To Beth who spent all last
weekend giving checkups

04:42.809 --> 04:44.779
to rescue dogs, pro bono.

04:45.380 --> 04:46.984
[laughter]

04:47.451 --> 04:51.459
But, most importantly to my
beautiful girlfriend Allegra or

04:51.493 --> 04:54.766
shall I say,
"Miss Generational Inspiration."

04:54.800 --> 04:56.570
[applause]

04:57.539 --> 04:59.976
Also, I got us a table at the
Arts Alliance gala,

05:00.010 --> 05:03.316
so we could go watch
Allegra accept her award.

05:04.418 --> 05:06.455
Who would I be
without you guys?

05:06.489 --> 05:07.592
[laughter]

05:07.625 --> 05:08.494
Right.

05:08.527 --> 05:09.529
Okay, hang on.

05:09.563 --> 05:10.865
Smile like you mean it.

05:12.836 --> 05:13.771
[camera sound]

05:13.804 --> 05:15.006
[laughter]

05:15.040 --> 05:16.677
Oh, I look terrible.

05:16.877 --> 05:17.912
You look great.

05:17.946 --> 05:19.014
[chuckles]

05:19.048 --> 05:20.551
I really want to go to the‐‐

05:20.585 --> 05:22.989
So, it's at the
New Orleans Jazz Museum.

05:23.022 --> 05:25.795
It's like creative
black tie or whatever,

05:25.828 --> 05:29.636
so no need to dress,
you know, any fancier.

05:29.669 --> 05:30.671
Okay, cool.

05:31.439 --> 05:34.411
[music]

05:39.956 --> 05:41.693
Hello.

05:42.996 --> 05:43.998
Ah, I'm so sorry.

05:44.031 --> 05:44.799
What?

05:44.833 --> 05:45.935
Oh, what.

05:46.570 --> 05:48.406
[crosstalk]

05:48.674 --> 05:50.678
We need to go...

05:50.711 --> 05:51.547
Avec toi?

05:51.580 --> 05:52.715
Where?

05:53.416 --> 05:55.821
[speaking French]

05:55.855 --> 05:57.124
[television]
Take it easy man, okay?

05:57.157 --> 06:01.600
What are you doing, that is not
his blood, that's so obvious.

06:01.867 --> 06:03.904
You're going to have to go
back to detective school

06:03.938 --> 06:05.575
young man.

06:05.608 --> 06:06.877
It's so dumb.

06:07.144 --> 06:08.479
Come on.

06:08.514 --> 06:09.716
What's happening?

06:09.749 --> 06:12.120
She's going to get it but her
partner is slowing her down,

06:12.154 --> 06:14.124
that's really annoying.

06:14.626 --> 06:16.663
What are you doing?

06:16.997 --> 06:18.801
Oh, no, come on.

06:19.502 --> 06:20.470
So, you saw it?

06:20.504 --> 06:21.138
Yes.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.009
Who do you think it is?

06:23.042 --> 06:24.144
Who cares, just block them.

06:24.178 --> 06:25.615
No, you're not supposed
to block them,

06:25.648 --> 06:27.685
that just stirs them up.

06:27.719 --> 06:29.589
Just ignore it then.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.497
You have the best smile.

06:34.699 --> 06:36.670
Sometimes I worry it's
like a grownup version

06:36.703 --> 06:38.473
of a school photo.

06:39.074 --> 06:40.043
[chuckles]

06:40.076 --> 06:41.647
It's perfect.

06:41.947 --> 06:44.018
I love that it's
a little crooked.

06:44.051 --> 06:45.487
It's my favorite.

06:45.521 --> 06:48.627
I hate that there are
these faceless weirdos on

06:48.661 --> 06:51.500
the internet that try to
ruin people's happiness.

06:52.969 --> 06:56.877
It's crazy, you have like 99
beautiful, positive comments

06:56.910 --> 07:00.818
and you choose to focus
on the one negative one.

07:01.118 --> 07:03.757
The one that's like,
stupid baloney.

07:04.593 --> 07:05.561
Don't do it.

07:06.462 --> 07:07.064
Thank you.

07:07.097 --> 07:08.634
I will protect you.

07:12.007 --> 07:13.176
Check my email.

07:13.209 --> 07:16.917
You have 22 unread
messages from Dermstore.

07:16.950 --> 07:18.954
Who gave you permission
to be this beautiful?

07:18.988 --> 07:19.889
Delete.

07:19.923 --> 07:23.664
From Ayanna M.,
I love all these ideas.

07:24.499 --> 07:25.835
Mark as unread.

07:27.805 --> 07:29.475
Open those new
messages for me.

07:29.709 --> 07:31.078
New text from Sarah,

07:31.112 --> 07:33.917
meeting Tinder girl after
dinner, eyes emoji.

07:34.118 --> 07:36.690
Sarah has changed
the name of the group to,

07:36.723 --> 07:39.094
excuse me, ma'am,
this is a Whataburger.

07:39.128 --> 07:40.130
[chuckles]

07:43.236 --> 07:44.873
Check those new comments.

07:45.206 --> 07:49.749
New comment from C101011,
posing with little black kids

07:49.783 --> 07:51.118
so everyone knows I'm a good‐‐

07:51.520 --> 07:52.655
Am I doing this right?

07:54.926 --> 07:58.099
These hashtags, is she
teaching them to write,

07:58.132 --> 07:59.536
or are they teaching her?

07:59.903 --> 08:01.740
[music]

08:09.589 --> 08:10.591
Hi.

08:11.760 --> 08:13.564
Excuse me, we have an
open‐door policy in this house.

08:13.597 --> 08:15.066
I just need one second, sorry.

08:15.100 --> 08:16.636
[music]

08:19.074 --> 08:20.110
[chuckles]

08:30.163 --> 08:31.700
That's a beautiful smile.

08:31.733 --> 08:34.271
You have a beautiful smile,
plus the light, oops...

08:34.939 --> 08:36.710
I like that one
from your account.

08:36.743 --> 08:38.814
‐ How do I unlike it?
‐ Oh, just tap it again.

08:40.350 --> 08:43.056
Isn't this supposed to be how
I feel about the comments,

08:43.089 --> 08:44.726
not whether you think
the comments

08:44.759 --> 08:45.795
are objectively right?

08:46.128 --> 08:47.999
How do you feel
about the comments?

08:48.199 --> 08:49.836
That they are objectively right.

08:49.869 --> 08:50.538
[chuckles]

08:50.571 --> 08:52.174
That's a thought, not a feeling.

08:52.207 --> 08:54.044
I feel...

08:54.078 --> 08:54.846
Um...

08:57.317 --> 08:58.086
seen‐‐

08:59.188 --> 09:00.290
and respected.

09:01.425 --> 09:04.599
You feel respected by these
comments, these comments?

09:04.833 --> 09:06.837
I feel like I'm being
taken seriously, yes.

09:08.239 --> 09:10.043
You have a loving partner.

09:10.076 --> 09:13.049
You have an incredible
supportive group of friends.

09:13.082 --> 09:16.188
You have all these students
that love and adore you,

09:16.656 --> 09:19.228
yet you feel that a random
stranger on the internet

09:19.261 --> 09:22.735
is the one person telling you
the truth about yourself?

09:23.637 --> 09:24.271
Yeah.

09:25.373 --> 09:28.146
Do you think you might
be too close to all of this?

09:28.179 --> 09:29.549
Sure, of course.

09:31.753 --> 09:32.822
But they're not.

09:34.391 --> 09:35.761
They're far from it, right?

09:35.795 --> 09:36.162
If they don't know me?

09:36.630 --> 09:37.698
Exactly.

09:37.732 --> 09:43.109
So, I'm too close to it and
they're too far from it.

09:43.142 --> 09:44.044
Correct.

09:44.913 --> 09:47.150
So, who am I supposed
to listen to?

09:47.184 --> 09:49.354
You listen to your heart.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.927
I am listening to my heart
but when I tell you

09:51.960 --> 09:53.129
what my heart is saying,

09:53.162 --> 09:54.732
you're telling me
that I'm wrong.

09:54.766 --> 09:55.768
[laughs]

09:55.801 --> 09:58.306
You don't know the intentions
of this source.

09:58.339 --> 09:59.809
Well, what if they're good?

09:59.843 --> 10:01.980
What if they're bad and
they're still right?

10:02.013 --> 10:04.051
People listen to
all kinds of things.

10:04.084 --> 10:06.723
Religion, horoscopes,
tarot cards.

10:06.756 --> 10:08.025
Nobody judges them.

10:08.059 --> 10:09.161
This speaks to me.

10:09.194 --> 10:10.764
Why can't I listen to it?

10:11.800 --> 10:14.171
I know you feel
you're struggling

10:15.240 --> 10:17.144
but you're doing
wonderful work here.

10:17.377 --> 10:19.716
and you're exactly
where you should be.

10:23.055 --> 10:24.759
Can I have my
phone back, please?

10:24.793 --> 10:27.164
[music]

11:08.379 --> 11:09.147
Hey!

11:09.816 --> 11:11.452
Ooh, wow, hello.

11:11.485 --> 11:14.024
Look at this runway model.

11:14.224 --> 11:15.360
It's not too much?

11:15.393 --> 11:16.930
No, we love.

11:16.963 --> 11:18.032
No, no, never.

11:18.065 --> 11:18.901
You look good.

11:20.470 --> 11:22.407
What would I do
without you guys?

11:22.440 --> 11:23.242
Hi.

11:23.276 --> 11:24.278
Ah, girl.

11:25.313 --> 11:26.783
Do you really like it?

11:27.985 --> 11:31.192
Listen, you were perfect and
now, you're just perfecter.

11:31.793 --> 11:32.260
Look at her.

11:32.294 --> 11:33.797
Allegra 2.0.

11:33.830 --> 11:35.200
That's my girl.

11:35.433 --> 11:36.368
Look at her.

11:37.003 --> 11:38.005
That's mine.

11:40.878 --> 11:41.813
Oh, Okay.

11:55.941 --> 11:56.910
What?

11:57.410 --> 11:58.346
This...

11:58.880 --> 12:00.116
This sleaze tilt.

12:00.483 --> 12:02.822
If you want private
phone time, no problem.

12:02.855 --> 12:04.224
You just go like this.

12:04.258 --> 12:05.426
This is legit.

12:05.460 --> 12:06.930
This is sleazy.

12:08.099 --> 12:09.434
Oh, great.

12:09.468 --> 12:11.272
Legit. Valid.

12:13.476 --> 12:14.478
[chuckles].

12:17.417 --> 12:21.258
Hey, I really want to do this
thing together that I read.

12:21.292 --> 12:22.427
On Goop?

12:22.460 --> 12:23.797
Not on Goop.

12:24.231 --> 12:25.466
Something like Goop.

12:26.335 --> 12:29.408
It's called a burn ceremony
where you write down

12:29.441 --> 12:32.180
all your fears and everything
you want to let go of and

12:32.213 --> 12:34.484
then you burn it in
a fire together and

12:34.519 --> 12:35.988
let go of everything.

12:36.856 --> 12:38.459
What if I don't want to
burn my fears?

12:39.161 --> 12:39.929
Why?

12:41.866 --> 12:42.802
Did I only choose my job

12:42.835 --> 12:45.006
because I want to seem
like a good person?

12:46.408 --> 12:48.814
Where is this coming from?

12:49.147 --> 12:50.183
I don't know.

12:51.285 --> 12:53.022
Is this that troll talking?

12:53.055 --> 12:54.859
Are you still reading that shit?

12:55.594 --> 13:00.303
Allegra, you're literally
about to get an award.

13:00.537 --> 13:02.073
Miss Generational Inspiration.

13:02.107 --> 13:02.942
Yeah‐‐

13:04.177 --> 13:05.848
What is that even?

13:05.881 --> 13:07.283
Were there other nominees?

13:07.317 --> 13:08.820
Did I lose it last year?

13:08.854 --> 13:11.258
Why do you let this
voice get into your head?

13:12.327 --> 13:14.899
Your life is amazing.

13:14.932 --> 13:16.503
Everything is going so great.

13:16.536 --> 13:18.306
They're obviously just jealous.

13:20.376 --> 13:21.245
I know.

13:22.515 --> 13:23.449
I know.

13:23.482 --> 13:25.821
[music]

13:38.245 --> 13:41.218
Hey, I don't know who you are
and why you're writing to me but

13:41.251 --> 13:44.291
I wanted to reach out and say,
you're clearly in pain and

13:44.324 --> 13:45.360
contrary to your beliefs,

13:45.393 --> 13:48.332
I am a very happy person
with a very fulfilling and

13:48.366 --> 13:53.042
satisfying life and I hope
whatever you're looking for,

13:53.075 --> 13:54.344
you find it.

13:57.651 --> 13:59.922
[background music]

14:43.109 --> 14:44.912
I truly feel sorry for you.

14:46.081 --> 14:49.121
You feel sorry for yourself,
as you should.

14:52.595 --> 14:54.398
Why are you obsessed
with me?

14:57.203 --> 14:59.040
Why are you obsessed
with me?

15:02.046 --> 15:04.886
You want me to seriously
engage with that question?

15:07.157 --> 15:09.060
I doubt you're capable of it.

15:10.363 --> 15:13.670
Obviously, it's because
I'm seeking validation.

15:15.507 --> 15:17.511
You get validation everywhere.

15:17.545 --> 15:19.314
You're not seeking
that from me.

15:19.615 --> 15:24.257
Think harder, if you can do it,
which I don't know if you can.

15:30.604 --> 15:34.377
Okay, I'm seeking an escape
from mindless validation.

15:35.581 --> 15:37.217
Oh, all right.

15:37.250 --> 15:39.922
That's the intelligent Allegra
I wanted to talk to.

15:41.659 --> 15:43.262
Your life still sucks though.

15:45.466 --> 15:47.370
You're all doing perfect.

15:48.305 --> 15:50.042
You can do better than that.

15:50.577 --> 15:54.986
Breathe and release anything
that does not serve you.

15:55.587 --> 15:58.225
I'm trying to see if I actually
exist underneath

15:58.259 --> 15:59.394
all this validation.

15:59.427 --> 16:01.599
You're out of mind,
by yourself.

16:01.633 --> 16:02.735
Oh, see?

16:02.768 --> 16:05.741
You're so much smarter
when you're actually challenged.

16:05.774 --> 16:08.379
Self‐love isn't selfish,
it's important.

16:08.412 --> 16:09.447
You know what?

16:09.481 --> 16:11.351
Validation isn't a bad thing.

16:11.385 --> 16:14.090
No one would ever be able
to do anything worthwhile

16:14.124 --> 16:16.228
without encouragement
and support.

16:17.297 --> 16:19.367
People would kill for
friends like these,

16:19.401 --> 16:23.142
for a partner like this,
for a support system like this.

16:24.512 --> 16:26.448
Sit, sit, sit.

16:26.481 --> 16:28.219
Why do you care about me?

16:28.252 --> 16:29.722
Are you someone I know?

16:29.755 --> 16:31.024
I don't care.

16:31.058 --> 16:32.495
It's easy to be honest when

16:32.528 --> 16:34.130
you don't care about somebody.

16:34.164 --> 16:37.170
And you know, unless you abandon
your need for validation,

16:37.203 --> 16:39.675
you will never become who
you're supposed to become.

16:39.709 --> 16:42.280
Allegra, we have
a little trick for you.

16:42.313 --> 16:45.019
You will never be free to
be who you want to be,

16:45.052 --> 16:46.154
who you could be.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.593
You could be saying
this to anyone.

16:49.294 --> 16:52.367
I was bored and went
back on all your posts,

16:52.568 --> 16:54.672
way back when you
wanted to be a writer.

16:55.172 --> 16:56.743
What happened to that, Allegra?

16:57.243 --> 16:59.314
Before you just wrote, "#Goals"

16:59.347 --> 17:02.120
you actually had goals and
wrote in full sentences.

17:02.387 --> 17:03.222
Okay.

17:03.255 --> 17:05.059
Every word you write,
ask yourself,

17:05.092 --> 17:05.961
"Am I full of shit?

17:05.994 --> 17:08.232
Do I even have an
inner voice or am I just

17:08.265 --> 17:10.571
an echo chamber for
other empty people?"

17:10.604 --> 17:13.777
all of us looking for as
many people as possible to say

17:13.810 --> 17:15.781
something nice about
us before we die.

17:20.624 --> 17:23.496
Who are you posting for
anyway, before I came along?

17:24.532 --> 17:26.235
I wasn't posting for anyone.

17:27.237 --> 17:29.040
Everybody posts for somebody,

17:29.341 --> 17:31.078
consciously or unconsciously.

17:31.278 --> 17:32.748
There's someone
you hope sees it.

17:34.484 --> 17:36.488
You can't post without
picturing someone.

17:37.190 --> 17:38.526
It's like coming.

17:38.560 --> 17:41.431
[background music]

17:48.212 --> 17:50.316
You know,
what's fucked up is that

17:50.349 --> 17:52.086
I read all these
self‐help books.

17:52.120 --> 17:52.888
That is fucked up.

17:52.922 --> 17:54.424
That's wonderful,
you're searching.

17:54.457 --> 17:56.596
No, what's fucked up
is even they'll tell you

17:56.629 --> 17:57.631
that you're already great.

17:57.665 --> 18:01.104
Believing in yourself
is an essential part‐‐

18:01.338 --> 18:04.110
Shouldn't there be two sections
in the bookstore, like,

18:04.545 --> 18:06.649
"How To Be A Badass Bitch"
and the sequel is‐‐

18:06.683 --> 18:08.252
"You Are A Badass Bitch".

18:08.285 --> 18:09.522
You're funny.

18:09.555 --> 18:11.291
Anyone ever tell
you you're funny?

18:11.325 --> 18:12.695
[chuckles]

18:12.728 --> 18:14.464
Everyone tells me everything.

18:15.801 --> 18:18.740
Sometimes you caption your
photos like you're deathly

18:18.773 --> 18:21.111
afraid someone's going
to tell you're pathetic.

18:21.144 --> 18:23.449
Did you realize you're not
fooling anyone when you

18:23.482 --> 18:25.252
pose in yoga gear,
full makeup, and‐‐

18:25.286 --> 18:27.123
The fact that you
captioned a selfie,

18:27.156 --> 18:29.427
"I stand with my AAPI
brothers and sisters,"

18:29.461 --> 18:30.831
kind of makes me
think you don't have

18:30.864 --> 18:31.933
any AAPI brothers and sisters.

18:31.966 --> 18:33.737
Everyone's doing that
above angle that's supposed

18:33.770 --> 18:34.905
to be flattering‐‐

18:34.939 --> 18:38.145
And, every time you talk about
destroying capitalism you

18:38.178 --> 18:39.882
usually buy something
online later that day.

18:39.915 --> 18:42.220
Why were you a better
writer on LiveJournal at 16

18:42.253 --> 18:43.188
than you are now?

18:44.925 --> 18:46.562
See you Monday, Ms. Allegra.

18:51.572 --> 18:53.777
You made me ask
questions I'd never asked,

18:53.810 --> 18:55.847
pointed out things
no one had told me.

18:55.881 --> 18:58.620
How come no one told me
any of these things before,

18:58.653 --> 19:00.323
because they couldn't
see them or

19:00.356 --> 19:01.693
because they couldn't say them?

19:01.726 --> 19:02.695
Which is worse?

19:02.728 --> 19:05.333
Hey, Meredith just texted and
said you quit.

19:05.366 --> 19:07.938
It's so weird that it's you
who's doing this to me.

19:07.971 --> 19:11.311
Everyone would think I'm crazy
listening to some hater online.

19:11.579 --> 19:14.351
I don't think you'd be listening
to me unless you had to.

19:14.384 --> 19:15.353
What do you mean?

19:15.386 --> 19:17.624
You see someone rooting
around in the trash,

19:17.658 --> 19:19.595
you don't ask, "What are
you looking for?"

19:19.628 --> 19:21.365
You ask, "What did you lose?"

19:23.536 --> 19:24.538
Mmm‐‐ toss.

19:27.276 --> 19:28.145
Toss.

can throw it out?

that transparent bag.

music for the first time.

you hear a song that instantly
makes you into an adult.

Garden State?

everything else

20:36.281 --> 20:37.450
right to your heart.

That one song that shows
you who you are and

what you want.

in the head enough

So what?

You think it's some super hot,
cool, sexy, awesome,

21:58.713 --> 22:00.517
smart lesbian, and then what?

22:00.550 --> 22:02.821
You're going to move in
together and have babies?

22:08.933 --> 22:10.002
It's not about that.

22:10.035 --> 22:11.739
It's about being
taken seriously.

22:11.772 --> 22:13.108
It's about being challenged.

22:13.141 --> 22:14.612
It's about being understood.

22:14.645 --> 22:16.983
It's about being told
the truth, finally.

22:19.855 --> 22:20.690
Yes.

22:29.542 --> 22:31.378
You just tell me
how perfect I am.

22:31.411 --> 22:33.482
Is that all you're capable of,

22:33.516 --> 22:35.520
or is that how honest
you can be, which?

22:36.956 --> 22:38.726

I could say right now.

24:02.594 --> 24:04.565
Hey, hey, hey, come here.

24:07.638 --> 24:08.673
I'm sorry.

24:09.875 --> 24:10.944
I'm so sorry.

24:25.674 --> 24:27.844
Hey, you are the best.

24:35.092 --> 24:36.161
It's fine.

24:36.762 --> 24:37.998
No, it's a little burnt.

24:38.031 --> 24:41.772
I like it when it's more golden
and then it goes like this.

24:44.310 --> 24:48.720
Okay, I am letting go of
my guilt over the animals of

24:48.753 --> 24:51.859
Hurricane Laura that
I couldn't save.

24:53.128 --> 24:57.504
I am letting go of my need
for external‐‐

24:58.105 --> 24:59.173
validation.

25:05.252 --> 25:09.027
I am letting go of my little
OCD around the house,

25:09.060 --> 25:10.029
[laughter]

25:10.062 --> 25:12.801
no offense to anyone
who has OCD, of course.

25:13.870 --> 25:18.111
I am letting go of the fear...

25:18.913 --> 25:20.215
that there is...

25:21.051 --> 25:25.159
someone I should be or
something I should be doing

25:25.192 --> 25:29.535
that isn't in the here and now.

25:35.179 --> 25:36.114
Yes!

25:36.147 --> 25:37.283
[laughter]

25:38.886 --> 25:39.955
Um...

25:43.195 --> 25:45.867
[background music]

25:45.900 --> 25:47.571
I want to give you something.

25:55.653 --> 25:56.922
What is this?

26:02.768 --> 26:04.738
It's the commentor...

26:04.772 --> 26:05.305
Um...

26:05.339 --> 26:06.341
After I blocked them,

26:06.374 --> 26:09.748
I hired this shady hacker
to track them down and

26:09.782 --> 26:11.685
find where they were
logging in from.

26:11.719 --> 26:13.656
So, that's their location.

26:14.725 --> 26:17.964
Just a random person in
a random office building

26:17.998 --> 26:19.200
in Dallas.

26:21.070 --> 26:22.206
[chuckles]

26:24.277 --> 26:25.880
You got them blocked?

26:27.349 --> 26:28.285
Yeah.

26:31.424 --> 26:32.894
You did that for me?

26:32.928 --> 26:33.796
Of course.

26:34.665 --> 26:36.134
I'll do anything for you.

26:40.810 --> 26:42.346
[music]

26:46.856 --> 26:49.761
[notification sounds]

26:55.239 --> 26:57.042
Smart people make
you feel smart,

26:57.309 --> 26:59.648
crazy people
make you feel crazy.

27:00.382 --> 27:02.821
I need to know who you
are to know who I am.

27:03.890 --> 27:06.027
[background music]

27:41.765 --> 27:44.337
Her smile is as
fake as her life.

27:44.738 --> 27:47.142
Her smile is as
fake as her life.

27:51.284 --> 27:53.856
Her smile is as
fake as her life.

28:05.178 --> 28:07.918
[music ends]

28:12.226 --> 28:14.096
Hey, is there a bathroom?

28:25.319 --> 28:26.187
[screams]

28:26.454 --> 28:28.191
I knew it, I knew it.

28:28.225 --> 28:30.028
I knew it would be worth it.

28:30.062 --> 28:31.498
I knew I would find
you here and

28:31.532 --> 28:34.270
I knew you weren't just
a loser in a basement.

28:36.474 --> 28:38.445
Did you ever think
this would happen?

28:40.950 --> 28:41.785
No.

28:48.833 --> 28:50.803
Can I ask you just one question?

28:51.371 --> 28:52.339
Okay.

28:54.878 --> 28:56.481
What should I do with my life?

28:59.153 --> 29:02.192
You want me, a stranger you
just met in the bathroom

29:02.226 --> 29:04.096
to tell you what
to do with your life?

29:05.098 --> 29:05.934
Yeah.

29:08.138 --> 29:09.908
Are you listening to yourself?

29:14.851 --> 29:17.524
That's a great question.

29:19.427 --> 29:20.462
I just feel‐‐

29:20.496 --> 29:23.468
I don't care what you meant,
I care what I heard.

29:23.970 --> 29:25.405
Let me just look at you.

29:25.439 --> 29:26.240
What?

29:31.184 --> 29:32.186
What?

29:34.925 --> 29:36.327
You look like a troll,

29:36.895 --> 29:38.231
like a pretty little troll.

29:38.264 --> 29:40.503
But whatever else you
think you are you're not.

29:40.536 --> 29:43.375
Your whole life is just a sad
reflection of the people you

29:43.408 --> 29:45.913
choose to obsess over.

29:45.947 --> 29:47.216
Thank you.

29:47.617 --> 29:49.286
I needed to hear that.

29:56.067 --> 29:57.236
I'm going to go now.

29:57.269 --> 29:57.937
Okay.

29:57.971 --> 29:59.808
I'll never forget you and um‐‐

30:01.277 --> 30:02.279
thank you.

30:03.883 --> 30:04.951
Fuck you.

30:06.354 --> 30:07.423
I love you.

30:10.429 --> 30:11.498
I love you.

30:14.036 --> 30:16.040
[music]

30:21.919 --> 30:23.254
I'm ready for a new job.

30:23.488 --> 30:25.125
I don't really like kids.

30:25.493 --> 30:27.998
I want to be a writer but
I'm not that good at it.

30:28.198 --> 30:30.168
I think I'll start
a vintage store.

30:30.202 --> 30:31.905
It's lame, but I don't care.

30:31.939 --> 30:35.445
Beth is beautiful and sexy,
but I'm sick of her.

30:35.646 --> 30:36.481
I'm hungry.

30:36.515 --> 30:38.619
Maybe there's a Sonic
on the way back.

30:38.652 --> 30:41.024
I love fast food on the highway,
It always tastes better.

30:41.057 --> 30:42.927
I wonder why? Huh.

30:43.596 --> 30:45.465
That's what my inner
voice sounds like.

30:45.500 --> 30:47.436
It's a little boring.

30:48.471 --> 30:50.409
