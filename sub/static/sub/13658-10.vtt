I'LL PERSONALLY SEE TO IT

40:10.075 --> 40:11.574
THAT THE SIX-YEAR TAIL
ON YOUR SENTENCE

40:11.576 --> 40:14.911
IS CARRIED OUT TO THE LETTER
IN AN UPSTATE PRISON.

40:14.913 --> 40:16.446
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!

40:16.448 --> 40:19.282
BECAUSE I DON'T DESERVE
THIS KIND OF TREATMENT AT ALL!

40:19.284 --> 40:20.750
OH, I AGREE.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.352
UNFORTUNATELY, ANYTHING MORE
I COULD DO TO YOU

40:22.354 --> 40:23.520
WOULD REQUIRE A TRIAL.

40:23.522 --> 40:25.288
BUT I WILL MAKE SURE

40:25.290 --> 40:27.857
THAT YOU ARE DRUG-TESTED
ON A RANDOM BASIS.

40:27.859 --> 40:30.093
I WILL HAVE YOUR CELL
SEARCHED REGULARLY.

40:30.095 --> 40:31.561
ANYTHING ELSE?

40:31.563 --> 40:34.531
I WILL HAVE CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMANTS REPORT TO ME

40:34.533 --> 40:37.133
ON YOUR BEHAVIOR.
AND THIS I PROMISE YOU.

40:37.135 --> 40:40.236
ONE SLIP -- ONE TINY STEP
OFF THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW

40:40.238 --> 40:42.205
TO THE LEFT
OR TO THE RIGHT --

40:42.207 --> 40:45.708
AND YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY ADD
SIX YEARS TO YOUR SENTENCE.

40:45.710 --> 40:48.545
WHY? WHY ARE --

40:48.547 --> 40:51.247
YOU ARE MAD AT ME
FOR SOME REASON.

40:51.249 --> 40:53.583
I GET IT.
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

40:53.585 --> 40:55.852
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

41:00.257 --> 41:02.425
WHAT ABOUT
FOR RUSTY'S SAKE?

41:02.427 --> 41:06.396
YOU KNOW, WHAT ABOUT [SIGHS]
FOR THE SAKE OF MY LITTLE BOY?

41:06.398 --> 41:09.466
THIS IS FOR RUSTY'S SAKE.
IT IS.

41:12.736 --> 41:15.939
YOU THINK YOU KNOW ME?
IS THAT IT?

41:15.941 --> 41:17.307
AND YOU THINK
YOU KNOW MY SON?

41:17.309 --> 41:19.843
AND YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST
HAVE ME BOXED UP

41:19.845 --> 41:21.144
AND OUT OF THE WAY?

41:21.146 --> 41:23.346
LADY, LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING.

41:23.348 --> 41:25.682
YOU JUST MADE
A REALLY BIG MISTAKE.

41:25.684 --> 41:28.785
I MADE A MISTAKE?
YES, YOU DID.

41:28.787 --> 41:30.587
OH, DEAR.

41:30.589 --> 41:32.422
MM.
ALLOW ME TO POINT OUT
TO YOU

41:32.424 --> 41:35.492
THAT YOU'RE THE ONE WEARING
THE BLUE JUMP SUIT,

41:35.494 --> 41:36.960
SURROUNDED BY GUARDS.

41:36.962 --> 41:39.562
AND I'M GETTING UP
TO GO HOME.

41:48.539 --> 41:50.907
OKAY, NO, B--

41:53.511 --> 41:57.180
AAH!

41:58.682 --> 41:59.782
[ SIGHS ]
