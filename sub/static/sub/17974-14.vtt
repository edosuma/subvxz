00:32.899 --> 00:36.068
Uncle Sam's
black dwarf nephew says,

00:36.070 --> 00:38.203
"Donna Tubbs
for School Board."

00:38.205 --> 00:41.874
"A vote for Tubbs is a
vote for Donna Tubbs."

00:41.876 --> 00:43.842
Here's another
6,000 fliers.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.010
How many do
you have left?

00:45.012 --> 00:46.712
6,000.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.247
Isn't it kind of
against your cause

00:48.249 --> 00:51.150
to keep us out of school
to do this?

00:51.152 --> 00:52.518
I don't want to hear
your complaints

00:52.520 --> 00:55.721
about being tired, poor
or yearning to be free.

00:55.723 --> 00:59.058
I have waited 16 years for
this board seat to open up.

00:59.060 --> 01:01.927
There is no position
in a small town

01:01.929 --> 01:03.996
that gives you more power
than the school board.

01:03.998 --> 01:06.698
Your dreams is small.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.168
"Are," Rallo, "Are."

01:09.170 --> 01:10.769
A school board member

01:10.771 --> 01:13.172
cannot have children
who speak ungrammatically.

01:13.174 --> 01:17.042
Our family must and shall
exude sophistication.

01:17.044 --> 01:18.043
Look what I found:

01:18.045 --> 01:20.345
A pancake
somebody ran over.

01:25.018 --> 01:26.552
(grunting)

01:26.554 --> 01:28.454
A vote for Tubbs
is a vote for Donna Tubbs.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.189
It's a waffle.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.290
I found a waffle.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.192
Cleveland,
what did I tell you

01:33.194 --> 01:35.060
about putting our
best foot forward

01:35.062 --> 01:37.029
when I'm running
for school board?

01:37.031 --> 01:38.797
Now, my hands are sticky
from the syrup,

01:38.799 --> 01:40.099
and as you'll notice,

01:40.101 --> 01:42.201
I've broken free
from my boxer shorts.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.569
Can a brother get a tuck?

01:43.571 --> 01:47.106
Cleveland, this election
is very important to me.

01:47.108 --> 01:48.073
I found another waffle.

01:48.075 --> 01:49.575
Oh, my God!

01:49.577 --> 01:51.643
Look, just
behave yourself.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.545
At least until
the election's over.

01:53.547 --> 01:54.546
But of course.

01:54.548 --> 01:55.981
(grunting quietly)

01:55.983 --> 01:57.316
If you'll excuse me,

01:57.318 --> 02:00.152
I have now broken
free in the back.

02:02.622 --> 02:05.124
Gentlemen, I present to you

02:05.126 --> 02:07.292
the Hurt Locker game.

02:07.294 --> 02:09.061
(cheering)

02:09.063 --> 02:11.763
Okay, that cardboard box
over by the Dumpster

02:11.765 --> 02:15.334
contains a C4-loaded
IED plastic explosive.

02:15.336 --> 02:18.770
Which one of us is going
to try to defuse it first?

02:18.772 --> 02:20.005
Lester?
Mm-mm.

02:20.007 --> 02:21.607
Tim?
Mm-mm.

02:21.609 --> 02:23.142
Holt?
Mm-mm.

02:23.144 --> 02:25.077
Franklin, the 49-year-old
bankruptcy lawyer

02:25.079 --> 02:26.979
we just started
hanging out with this week?

02:26.981 --> 02:28.413
Hells, yeah,
I'll do it.

02:28.415 --> 02:30.082
Cleveland, you've
really made me feel

02:30.084 --> 02:31.517
like part of the gang.

02:31.519 --> 02:34.086
I look forward to years
of misadventures with you.

02:34.088 --> 02:36.088
As us also do we.

02:36.090 --> 02:37.556
Duck for cover!

02:47.200 --> 02:49.168
(over radios):
Whoa!
Wow!

02:49.170 --> 02:51.637
Awesome!
Holy (bleep)!

02:51.639 --> 02:54.106
Franklin, that was so cool.

02:54.108 --> 02:56.208
Better luck next time, buddy.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.276
Franklin, do you copy?

02:57.278 --> 02:59.378
Franklin?

02:59.380 --> 03:01.647
(Holt over radio):
Big Brown,
this is Muscle Milk. Over.

03:01.649 --> 03:03.615
I think something's wrong
with Franklin's headset.

03:03.617 --> 03:04.950
Oh, God.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.151
(over radio):
Guys, it's Gus.

03:06.153 --> 03:08.387
Those hot wings
you ordered are ready.

03:08.389 --> 03:11.490
Hope this isn't a bad time.
Over.

03:11.492 --> 03:14.359
No, Gus,
you were right to tell us.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.228
(sobbing)

03:16.230 --> 03:18.063
This would be a good example

03:18.065 --> 03:20.399
of what I was talking about
when I told you to behave.

03:20.401 --> 03:21.967
Going to a funeral?

03:21.969 --> 03:23.168
Causing the funeral

03:23.170 --> 03:25.304
by blowing up some guy
outside a bar.

03:25.306 --> 03:27.306
When did you get
so uptight?

03:27.308 --> 03:30.676
I'm gonna go
sit up front.

03:30.678 --> 03:32.044
(sobbing)

03:32.046 --> 03:34.546
I'm so sorry for your loss.

03:34.548 --> 03:38.684
Donna Tubbs for School Board.

03:38.686 --> 03:41.086
(bell ringing)

03:41.088 --> 03:42.888
Look at y'all.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.856
Do I need to find
Dracula's coffin

03:44.858 --> 03:46.358
and remove the stake
from his heart

03:46.360 --> 03:48.260
to see a decent sit-up
around here?

03:52.865 --> 03:54.766
(whistles)

03:54.768 --> 03:57.202
The utensil that goes
both ways.

03:57.204 --> 03:59.404
I see you've forgotten
your gym clothes

03:59.406 --> 04:01.240
for the third time
this week.

04:01.242 --> 04:03.208
You have surpassed
the maximum allowance

04:03.210 --> 04:05.944
of 90 gym class absences
per semester,

04:05.946 --> 04:07.746
and will fail P.E.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.181
Isn't there
anything I can do

04:09.183 --> 04:10.182
to save my future?

04:10.184 --> 04:12.451
Yes, you can
receive the credit

04:12.453 --> 04:14.119
by signing up
for a sport.

04:14.121 --> 04:15.120
Any sport.

04:15.122 --> 04:16.455
Celebrity poker?

04:16.457 --> 04:18.690
That is no longer
offered at this school

04:18.692 --> 04:21.293
since David Spade impregnated
the volleyball team.

04:21.295 --> 04:22.561
(grunting)

04:22.563 --> 04:24.263
Wah.
Wah.

04:24.265 --> 04:26.265
This is as tall
as I'm gonna get.

04:31.204 --> 04:33.372
So, you think the
diving team, huh?

04:33.374 --> 04:34.573
Well, how would
I get up there?

04:34.575 --> 04:35.974
Would a crane lift me?

04:35.976 --> 04:38.143
Or does the board lower
to get me or...

04:38.145 --> 04:40.212
No, you would have
to climb the ladder.

04:40.214 --> 04:41.913
Ehh.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.715
But everything else
is just falling.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.217
Falling on purpose?

04:45.219 --> 04:46.718
I'll give it a shot.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.453
Good work, Ernie.

04:49.422 --> 04:51.223
Hi. Cleveland Brown, Jr.

04:51.225 --> 04:53.225
I've got to sign up
for some stupid sport.

04:53.227 --> 04:54.259
Fine.

04:54.261 --> 04:55.460
Go for it.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.696
May God have mercy
on the pool.

04:58.598 --> 05:03.068
(light grunting)

05:03.070 --> 05:06.338
(panting)

05:06.340 --> 05:07.773
(laughing)

05:07.775 --> 05:09.408
Give him a chance.

05:09.410 --> 05:12.844
Four eyes, full gut.
Can't lose.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.284
(gasping)

05:19.286 --> 05:21.286
I haven't seen
a tuck that good

05:21.288 --> 05:24.156
since  <i>Silence</i>
<i>of the Lambs.</i>

05:24.158 --> 05:25.424
You're on the team.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.258
Hooray.

05:26.260 --> 05:28.293
My GPA is saved.

05:28.295 --> 05:31.296
Congratulations,
Junior.

05:31.298 --> 05:32.998
Welcome aboard, son.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.533
Here's your uniform.

05:34.535 --> 05:38.470
Okay, that'll hold one
of my nards.

05:38.472 --> 05:39.604
What about
the other one?

05:39.606 --> 05:41.340
That's your
entire uniform.

05:45.645 --> 05:48.347
I knew I shouldn't have
eaten all that food.

05:51.050 --> 05:53.652
To Franklin,
who never saw it coming.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.821
And apparently
never saw  <i>Hurt Locker.</i>

05:55.823 --> 05:57.856
ALL:
To Franklin.

05:57.858 --> 06:02.160
Anyway, I told Donna
I am who I am

06:02.162 --> 06:04.296
and I'm going to behave
like I am going to behave.

06:04.298 --> 06:06.465
Is that why you're not

06:06.467 --> 06:08.867
at the school board
candidates' dinner tonight?

06:08.869 --> 06:10.802
Candidates' dinner tonight?

06:10.804 --> 06:12.571
Oh, God,
she probably told me about it

06:12.573 --> 06:14.039
and I wasn't listening.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.073
Wait a minute.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.308
How do you know
about it?

06:16.310 --> 06:17.409
I follow Donna
on Twitter.

06:17.411 --> 06:20.145
It's a very serious,
solemn, unfunny account.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.380
That's her.

06:21.382 --> 06:23.348
She always retweets
medical scares.

06:23.350 --> 06:25.050
I got to get
to that dinner.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.485
Gus, a suit.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.153
48 stout.

06:28.155 --> 06:29.454
GUS:
You got it!

06:31.190 --> 06:33.725
Excuse me. I'm looking
for the boring dinner.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.428
Well, let's see:
there's the seminar
on pet insurance,

06:36.430 --> 06:39.331
the Harry's Law Fan Fiction
Convention

06:39.333 --> 06:40.365
and then, worst of all,

06:40.367 --> 06:42.501
the School Board
Candidates' Dinner.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.502
Thanks.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.404
And he realized
then and there,

06:45.406 --> 06:48.707
it was truly Harry's law.

06:48.709 --> 06:51.276
You never even saw
the show, did you?

06:51.278 --> 06:52.844
No, but was I close?

06:52.846 --> 06:53.678
Yes.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.414
Donna's dinner!

06:58.384 --> 06:59.785
EMCEE:
Next, please welcome

06:59.787 --> 07:01.520
Candidate Donna Tubbs
and her husband...

07:01.522 --> 07:02.788
Just in time.

07:02.790 --> 07:05.424
Cleveland Brown.

07:05.426 --> 07:06.358
(gasping):
Oh, my God.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.126
Donna's replaced me?

07:08.128 --> 07:11.430
Or what if that is me up there

07:11.432 --> 07:15.133
and I've stepped through a
break in the
time-space continuum?

07:15.135 --> 07:17.402
It's me,
Future Cleveland.

07:17.404 --> 07:20.405
I've come to tell you that
that's not what happened.

07:20.407 --> 07:21.440
She did replace you.

07:21.442 --> 07:22.674
Aw.

07:26.712 --> 07:28.146
Thank you for coming.

07:28.148 --> 07:30.382
My well-behaved husband,
Cleveland, and I

07:30.384 --> 07:32.117
appreciate your support.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.485
Hi, I'm Cleveland.

07:33.487 --> 07:34.886
I hope you had
a good last weekend,

07:34.888 --> 07:36.655
and I hope you have a
good weekend this weekend.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.623
Well, thank you
and thank you.

07:38.625 --> 07:39.891
Isn't he pleasant?

07:39.893 --> 07:41.493
Thank you for coming.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.495
My well-behaved husband,
Cleveland, and I

07:43.497 --> 07:44.896
appreciate your support.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.398
Hi, I'm Cleveland.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.399
Nice to meet you.

07:47.401 --> 07:48.934
Cleveland, is it?

07:48.936 --> 07:51.036
What an awesome name!

07:53.673 --> 07:55.407
What's going on, Donna?

07:55.409 --> 07:57.576
I demand an explanation!

07:57.578 --> 07:59.945
And some of those
small sandwiches!

07:59.947 --> 08:01.580
I never got to work my way
over there!

08:01.582 --> 08:03.315
Turkey!

08:03.317 --> 08:04.583
If they're out, roast beef!

08:04.585 --> 08:05.984
No tuna, obviously!

08:05.986 --> 08:07.519
It doesn't travel well!

08:07.521 --> 08:08.487
You know
what I like!

08:08.489 --> 08:09.654
I'm mad at you!

08:14.126 --> 08:15.293
Fell asleep.

08:15.295 --> 08:16.461
I was gonna do a whole

08:16.463 --> 08:18.430
"stewing husband
sitting in the dark" thing,

08:18.432 --> 08:20.665
but the old lids
got a little heavy.

08:20.667 --> 08:21.933
Can we try again?

08:21.935 --> 08:24.269
(sighs)

08:24.271 --> 08:26.004
(snoring)

08:26.006 --> 08:27.439
Well, well, well.

08:27.441 --> 08:29.941
How was the
candidates' dinner?

08:29.943 --> 08:31.676
Or should you be asking me,

08:31.678 --> 08:33.678
since I was the one
there with you?

08:33.680 --> 08:35.714
Cleveland, I'm sorry
you had to see that,

08:35.716 --> 08:38.950
and that security threw you
through your car windshield.

08:38.952 --> 08:40.485
That was from earlier
in the evening.

08:40.487 --> 08:42.654
I hit a rare eagle on the way
to the event.

08:42.656 --> 08:44.623
Who was that man, Donna?

08:44.625 --> 08:46.958
That was Ebert Williams,
the man I hired

08:46.960 --> 08:48.627
to be my campaign husband.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.395
I just can't risk
having you embarrass me

08:50.397 --> 08:51.463
before the election.

08:51.465 --> 08:52.697
So, there it is.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.966
Go on.
No, I'm done now.

08:54.968 --> 08:56.201
Oh, okay.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.469
So, there it is.

08:57.471 --> 08:59.504
(sobbing): How could
you replace me, Donna?

08:59.506 --> 09:00.472
How did you?

09:00.474 --> 09:01.540
Did you clone me?

09:01.542 --> 09:02.574
Did you use stem cells?

09:02.576 --> 09:03.475
What are stem cells?

09:03.477 --> 09:05.477
I'm against stem cells.

09:05.479 --> 09:07.245
Actually, your dad
recommended Ebert.

09:07.247 --> 09:08.847
He's been using him
for years.

09:08.849 --> 09:11.483
NARRATOR:
Welcome, Freight Train
and Cleveland.

09:11.485 --> 09:13.985
You're team number one.

09:13.987 --> 09:18.356
Please accept this
traditional Croatian
woman as your reward.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.592
(chuckling):
Man, we gonna bust her up.

09:20.594 --> 09:23.228
Cleveland, I'm sorry
if this hurts your feelings,

09:23.230 --> 09:26.831
but if I win, I'll be
only the 19th black woman

09:26.833 --> 09:28.500
to be on
the school board.

09:28.502 --> 09:30.502
We're talking
about history here.

09:30.504 --> 09:32.671
But what about my dignity?

09:32.673 --> 09:36.241
I want you to break up
with your fake husband!

09:36.243 --> 09:37.509
(sobbing)

09:37.511 --> 09:40.211
And you didn't bring me
any sandwiches.

09:40.213 --> 09:41.746
I did. Tuna.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.950
No! That's worse
than bringing nothing.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.751
(high-pitched voice):
You didn't listen.

09:54.527 --> 09:56.528
Ernie, could you
please walk faster?

09:56.530 --> 09:57.529
Nope.

09:57.531 --> 09:59.531
Osteoporosis.

09:59.533 --> 10:00.532
Let me tell
you something.

10:00.534 --> 10:02.534
Swim team's
had six practices,

10:02.536 --> 10:04.069
and you've missed
all of them.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.470
If you don't
want an incomplete,

10:05.472 --> 10:07.606
you will be at
that meet Saturday

10:07.608 --> 10:10.275
in your Speedo
and nothing else.

10:10.277 --> 10:13.311
Although, you'll want to wear
jeans or sweats to the match.

10:13.313 --> 10:16.548
But don't wear the same color
sweatshirt and sweatpants.

10:16.550 --> 10:18.750
It's just...
it's just not a good look.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.585
Okay. Bye.

10:20.587 --> 10:22.887
(humming)

10:24.323 --> 10:26.257
Junior, you love
them textbooks.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.726
It's over, Johnny!

10:27.728 --> 10:29.561
My academic career is over!

10:29.563 --> 10:31.563
I am a fat kid!

10:31.565 --> 10:33.832
And I cannot get up in front
of the entire school

10:33.834 --> 10:36.534
with Papa Smurf's hat
on my ding-dong!

10:38.104 --> 10:40.572
I'm not sure
you're thinking clearly.

10:40.574 --> 10:42.574
I've never
had more clarity.

10:42.576 --> 10:44.776
Goodbye,
Stoolbend High, forever.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.611
I'm off to my new life

10:46.613 --> 10:49.648
as either a plus-sized
hand model or a day laborer,

10:49.650 --> 10:51.783
whichever I
can find first.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.418
Good-bye, Ernie.
(cracking)

10:53.420 --> 10:55.020
Silly osteoporosis.

10:55.022 --> 10:56.655
And I'm only 17.

10:59.291 --> 11:01.126
So, Cleveland threw
a temper tantrum

11:01.128 --> 11:02.794
and wants me
to fire you.

11:02.796 --> 11:04.629
And maybe it's the
right thing to do.

11:04.631 --> 11:05.930
Doesn't matter to me.

11:05.932 --> 11:07.699
I clear 12K a year
being Cleveland

11:07.701 --> 11:08.700
for Freight Train.

11:08.702 --> 11:10.835
In fact, he's trying to
book me tomorrow

11:10.837 --> 11:13.104
so he can read me
a bedtime story.

11:13.106 --> 11:16.107
On the other hand,
the debate is tomorrow,

11:16.109 --> 11:18.610
and I just know that Cleveland
will show up in a pirate hat,

11:18.612 --> 11:20.445
making fart noises,

11:20.447 --> 11:22.714
wearing a T-shirt that says
"Master Debater."

11:22.716 --> 11:24.349
It's gonna cost you
either way, Donna,

11:24.351 --> 11:26.651
because I have a 24-hour
cancellation policy,

11:26.653 --> 11:29.354
and your insurance will
probably only cover
half of it.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.989
Screw it. You're right.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.624
I've come too far.

11:32.626 --> 11:33.892
This is my time,

11:33.894 --> 11:35.827
and the school board
is just a steppingstone.

11:35.829 --> 11:38.530
Before you know it,
I'll be the port commissioner,

11:38.532 --> 11:40.165
then comptroller.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.400
And then, that's it.

11:42.402 --> 11:45.070
I'm telling Cleveland
you're not fired.

11:45.072 --> 11:47.672
Yeah, your last check bounced,
Donna.

11:47.674 --> 11:49.174
So it's cash from here on in.

11:49.176 --> 11:52.077
Thanks for coming
to Gustavo's, Donna.

11:52.079 --> 11:54.713
Welcome to the
Broken Stool, Donna.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.147
Sorry, Gus.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.716
No time for your weirdness.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.684
Make time!
Uh...

11:59.686 --> 12:01.686
Uh...
CLEVELAND:
Donna!

12:01.688 --> 12:04.689
Oh, power lunching
at Gustavo's, huh?

12:04.691 --> 12:05.724
So did you do it?

12:05.726 --> 12:07.525
Did you talk
to your fake husband?

12:07.527 --> 12:08.827
Uh, yes.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.662
Yay! Our lives are reset.

12:10.664 --> 12:14.265
And I've decided he's gonna
stay on as my
campaign husband.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.701
He projects the kind
of clean-cut, responsible,

12:16.703 --> 12:18.770
not gonna blow up his friends

12:18.772 --> 12:21.606
playing  <i>The Hurt Locker </i> game
image I need to get elected.

12:21.608 --> 12:25.710
In my defense, we were
gonna play  <i>Human Centipede.</i>

12:25.712 --> 12:28.680
It's not just  <i>The Hurt Locker</i>
<i>game, Cleveland.</i>

12:28.682 --> 12:30.448
You cause a funeral
every week.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.684
Sometimes real,
sometimes fake.

12:32.686 --> 12:34.119
You're always wearing dresses.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.720
Or burkas.

12:35.722 --> 12:37.722
And look at yourself.
You're not even wearing pants.

12:37.724 --> 12:39.724
Holt is wearing
them as a shirt.

12:39.726 --> 12:41.559
Fits perfect, bro.

12:41.561 --> 12:43.695
That's funny, Donna.

12:43.697 --> 12:44.863
That's a grown little man

12:44.865 --> 12:46.698
with his head sticking
out of my zipper.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.566
Why are you not laughing?

12:48.568 --> 12:49.801
Cleveland, all I'm trying...

12:49.803 --> 12:51.569
What's happened
to you, Donna?

12:51.571 --> 12:53.705
When did you turn
into such a... this?

12:53.707 --> 12:57.709
You don't even laugh at
the E Trade baby anymore.

12:57.711 --> 12:58.877
You used to be fun!

12:58.879 --> 13:00.712
What happened to
Dynamite Donna?

13:00.714 --> 13:01.780
Remember her?

13:02.782 --> 13:05.150
Where's Dynamite Donna?

I remember that night.

13:14.828 --> 13:17.729
That was the first time I wore
Robert's pants on my head.

13:17.731 --> 13:19.063
(laughs)

13:19.065 --> 13:20.298
That's not funny.

you're this stick in the mud.

13:26.807 --> 13:30.608

13:30.610 --> 13:31.743
Well, good luck,

13:31.745 --> 13:33.745
'cause no one's gonna
vote for you.

13:33.747 --> 13:36.247
People want to vote for
someone they can
have a beer with,

13:36.249 --> 13:39.584
and right now, I don't think
anyone in this bar

13:39.586 --> 13:40.852
would have a beer with you.

13:40.854 --> 13:42.086
That's not true.

13:43.422 --> 13:45.323
(gasps)
You're right.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.026
I guess it wouldn't hurt
to have just one.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.011
Blacked out on a Tuesday.

14:14.821 --> 14:17.222
Motor oil and Kellie Pickler?

We must be at the Richmond
International Raceway!

The debate's in an hour, and
we're four hours from home!

Uh-oh!

14:34.473 --> 14:35.807
What happened last night?

14:35.809 --> 14:37.242
How did we even get here?

No, we Bugs Bunny'd

Cleveland, this is hopeless.

I'll never make that debate.

The election is
as good as lost.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.276
No, it's not.

This lady's gonna be late

Guys, we got a school board
emergency.

What?
I need tires and gas

17:19.039 --> 17:20.338

17:36.255 --> 17:38.256
Aah!
So which one of us won?

17:38.258 --> 17:40.491
I'll tell you who won:
the children of Stoolbend

17:40.493 --> 17:42.026
because there's nothing
more important

17:42.028 --> 17:43.261
than a public debate
about the issues

17:43.263 --> 17:45.663
confronting educators
in a shrinking economy.

17:45.665 --> 17:47.498
You want to do doughnuts
in the parking lot?

17:47.500 --> 17:49.033
No, I want to go read a book.

17:49.035 --> 17:51.936
Of course I want to do
doughnuts in the parking lot.

17:51.938 --> 17:54.505

17:54.507 --> 17:57.108
Oh, Cleveland,
what am I doing?

17:57.110 --> 17:59.510
I can't go up there
like this.

17:59.512 --> 18:02.080
You don't have to because
I'm going to do to you

18:02.082 --> 18:04.382
what I and cats have
been doing for years:

18:04.384 --> 18:06.484
a tongue bath.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.190
Thank you, Cleveland.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.291
What about you?

18:13.293 --> 18:16.360
There's no time, and I
have no more saliva.

18:16.362 --> 18:19.097
Besides, your husband's
already up there.

18:20.265 --> 18:22.800
And I want you to win.

Sit down, Ebes.

18:43.323 --> 18:46.124
That's my husband.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.091
(gasping)

18:47.093 --> 18:48.493
I got my spit back!

18:48.495 --> 18:50.228
(sighs)
Yes,

18:50.230 --> 18:52.797
my husband
embarrasses me sometimes,

18:52.799 --> 18:54.799
but who's never
been embarrassed?

18:55.434 --> 18:56.601
If people were scared

18:56.603 --> 18:58.069
of being embarrassed,

18:58.071 --> 18:59.604
we would have
no Adam Sandler movies

18:59.606 --> 19:01.439
or politicians.

19:01.441 --> 19:04.075
You think Newt Gingrich cares
that everybody knows

19:04.077 --> 19:06.077
he had two failed
open marriages?

19:06.079 --> 19:08.112
And do you think
his current wife cares

19:08.114 --> 19:10.114
that everyone knows
she's the whore

19:10.116 --> 19:12.083
who cheated with a married man

19:12.085 --> 19:14.852
while his wife
was battling M.S.?

19:14.854 --> 19:17.088
No, because it was fun.

19:17.090 --> 19:20.258
And so is my husband.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.827
I'm proud of him.

19:25.030 --> 19:28.132
And education can be fun, too.

19:28.134 --> 19:29.167
(cheering)

19:29.169 --> 19:31.602
Miss Donna was right.

19:31.604 --> 19:34.972
I've got nothing
to be embarrassed of.

19:34.974 --> 19:37.141
(sighs)
And that's my stepson,

19:37.143 --> 19:40.044
who never misses
a school board meeting.

19:40.046 --> 19:41.512
Send me the minutes.

19:53.125 --> 19:55.193
(cheering)

19:55.195 --> 19:57.128
(gasps)

19:57.130 --> 19:59.964
(squeaking)

20:12.978 --> 20:14.078
(phone rings)

20:14.080 --> 20:15.146
Yes?

20:15.148 --> 20:16.247
It's the results.

20:17.182 --> 20:18.216
I see.

20:18.218 --> 20:20.218
Yes, thank you.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.153
You lost by four votes.

20:22.155 --> 20:23.888
Oh, no.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.524
But the margin was
small enough

20:26.526 --> 20:29.660
that it triggered the state's
automatic recount provision!

20:29.662 --> 20:31.329
There will be a recount!

20:31.331 --> 20:33.431
NARRATOR:   <i>Next week,</i>
<i>on </i> The Cleveland Show...

20:33.433 --> 20:35.333
My mama's gonna win.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.235
You'll see. You'll all see!

20:38.237 --> 20:40.204
I want back in.

20:40.206 --> 20:41.239
(gasps)

20:41.241 --> 20:44.075
(moaning)

20:48.780 --> 20:52.116
Thank you.
The recount is in. You lost.

20:52.118 --> 20:53.584
NARRATOR:

20:53.586 --> 20:54.785
