Police!

00:11.872 --> 00:13.897
Police!

00:18.612 --> 00:20.045
Too bad.

00:21.719 --> 00:23.855
Let's check the back.

00:23.955 --> 00:25.990
- There's nobody here.
- Come on, let's go.

00:26.090 --> 00:28.173
Come on.

00:36.013 --> 00:37.878
It's open.

01:16.599 --> 01:18.929
There's nobody, Ulises.

01:19.029 --> 01:20.367
Look.

01:20.467 --> 01:22.353
Take a look at this.

01:26.133 --> 01:27.600
Santeria.

01:28.031 --> 01:29.494
Except for the mouth.

01:30.317 --> 01:31.988
Looks like blood.

01:33.369 --> 01:35.303
Let's have it checked out.

01:39.350 --> 01:41.944
Find something that connects him
with the Vasquez cartel.

01:42.044 --> 01:43.302
Good.

02:46.481 --> 02:47.800
Ulises!

02:51.735 --> 02:53.604
Ulises!

03:00.285 --> 03:02.754
I think I found something else.

03:02.854 --> 03:04.760
And it looks human!

03:15.433 --> 03:18.243
Now can we please
get the fuck out of here?

03:32.490 --> 03:34.481
<i>Policíal</i>

03:38.227 --> 03:40.155
Come out now!

03:55.760 --> 03:58.362
Looks like they moved out in a hurry.

03:58.462 --> 04:03.161
Son of a bitch must have known
we were coming.

04:06.958 --> 04:09.497
They came out of nowhere, Ulises.

04:21.300 --> 04:23.962
Your jails can't hold us.

04:46.341 --> 04:51.001
And your bullets can't hurt us.

04:52.663 --> 04:56.311
We just want to talk to Santillan.

04:59.036 --> 05:00.833
You're too late.

05:02.996 --> 05:04.632
He turned into a bird...

05:06.742 --> 05:08.495
and flew away.

05:21.810 --> 05:24.745
No! No! No!

05:35.046 --> 05:38.090
No! No!

06:00.534 --> 06:02.061
No!

06:13.107 --> 06:14.886
No!

06:42.503 --> 06:45.063
No! No!

06:48.777 --> 06:49.766
Ulises.

06:53.573 --> 06:55.531
Ulises... 

06:56.358 --> 06:58.074
Help me.

07:08.171 --> 07:11.538
Cowardly sons of bitches.

07:21.806 --> 07:26.038
So what do we do with these?

07:28.533 --> 07:30.112
Take them up to the farm.

07:30.778 --> 07:34.473
Papa wants a cop's eyes for his Nganga.

07:43.773 --> 07:45.164
Finish him.

07:47.411 --> 07:48.473
Me?

07:50.476 --> 07:51.777
Prove yourself, Luis.

07:52.334 --> 07:53.979
Prove yourself.

07:54.079 --> 07:57.694
Or should I tell Papa you
didn't have the balls?

07:59.855 --> 08:05.617
Please... Leave him alone...

08:06.979 --> 08:09.106
Leave him alone.

08:09.182 --> 08:13.951
Leave him alone,
you son of a bitch!

08:14.051 --> 08:17.567
Leave him alone!

08:17.667 --> 08:19.947
Open your eyes.

08:20.047 --> 08:21.787
- No!
- Open your eyes.

08:21.887 --> 08:25.556
No, you sick bastard!

08:27.295 --> 08:30.093
Papa wants you to watch...

08:30.193 --> 08:34.094
and tell your cop buddies...

08:34.193 --> 08:36.496
who did this.

08:41.532 --> 08:46.196
Noooo!

10:57.816 --> 10:59.827
Poor people are poor
because they're lazy.

10:59.927 --> 11:02.101
You know what? Fuck the poor.
Fuck 'em, all right?

11:02.201 --> 11:05.390
What, it's my problem that somebody
can't compete in the open market?

11:05.490 --> 11:07.325
We're supposed to help
the disadvantaged.

11:07.425 --> 11:10.132
Boo-fuckin'- hoo. My old man,
he was a mechanic, okay?

11:10.232 --> 11:12.289
A grease monkey his whole life.

11:12.389 --> 11:14.720
Now, in two days,
I'm off to the Wharton School.

11:14.820 --> 11:16.460
Two years, I got my MBA,

11:16.560 --> 11:18.997
and the world is my oyster.

11:19.097 --> 11:21.961
You're an inspiration
to us all.

11:22.061 --> 11:24.107
Can we go now?

11:32.827 --> 11:36.422
Some primo sticky
for my beautiful lefty friend.

11:40.511 --> 11:43.381
Hey, why don't you,
uh, stick around?

11:43.481 --> 11:45.449
You coming?

11:46.451 --> 11:47.941
Bye, Henry.

11:53.708 --> 11:57.316
We gotta bail
this fuckin' summer camp.

11:57.416 --> 11:58.789
Did you find Ed?

11:58.889 --> 12:00.772
No.

12:00.872 --> 12:03.977
But I did watch some guy
nail Courtney Anderson.

12:04.443 --> 12:05.653
Oh, yeah?

12:05.753 --> 12:08.091
That's practically
a rite of passage.

12:08.863 --> 12:10.925
Yeah, well, I haven't.

12:11.025 --> 12:13.133
Right. That's 'cause
your head's been filled

12:13.233 --> 12:15.521
with all that wack
fire and brimstone shit.

12:15.597 --> 12:17.861
It's not wack, Henry.

12:20.183 --> 12:23.084
Yo, where the fuck is Eddie?

12:24.017 --> 12:26.145
I wanna get to the border
by noon.

12:30.299 --> 12:31.592
Hey!

12:32.843 --> 12:35.579
Ed! Eddie!

12:35.679 --> 12:37.948
Dude, where ya been?

12:38.048 --> 12:40.573
We've been looking for you
all night.

12:48.266 --> 12:51.526
Hey, stop worrying.
You're doing the right thing.

12:56.087 --> 12:58.698
Shit! No way!

13:00.111 --> 13:02.347
- You fucking maniac!
- Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay!

13:02.447 --> 13:04.744
- What the fuck's wrong with you?
- Whoo! - Fuck!

13:04.844 --> 13:06.953
Lmagine a land, if you will,

13:07.053 --> 13:08.988
where a man can be a man.

13:09.088 --> 13:10.723
A land where he can

13:10.823 --> 13:13.709
indulge in all
those animal urges,

13:13.809 --> 13:17.345
far from the petty judgments
of parents and teachers

13:17.445 --> 13:19.003
and less-enlightened peers.

13:19.080 --> 13:21.071
A land where he can
ride the demon!

13:21.171 --> 13:22.751
- Yeah!
- Behave bad!

13:22.851 --> 13:24.753
- Bad!
- Whatever he goddamn well pleases,

13:24.853 --> 13:26.900
and no one gives a shit,
including the cops.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.401
Tell it, Brother Henry!

13:28.501 --> 13:30.731
- I'm talking real freedom, my friend!
- Real freedom!

13:30.831 --> 13:33.656
Not this overregulated bullshit that
passes for liberty in our country.

13:33.756 --> 13:34.924
Hell, no!

13:35.024 --> 13:37.084
Let's go to the border!

13:37.184 --> 13:38.352
Mexico.

13:38.452 --> 13:40.353
We leave right now,
we hit Manzanita

13:40.453 --> 13:42.560
right about the time
the strip joints open.

13:42.660 --> 13:44.599
- I'm gonna get laid.
- You're kidding.

13:44.699 --> 13:46.797
I finally convinced
our upstanding minister's son

13:46.897 --> 13:48.265
- to get his cherry popped.
- Pop!

13:48.365 --> 13:49.602
A truly blessed event.

13:49.702 --> 13:51.534
Let's pray he doesn't
contract an STD.

13:51.634 --> 13:53.008
Worrywart.

13:53.108 --> 13:56.385
Fellas, say hello
to the senoritas for me.

14:02.490 --> 14:05.154
Come on, man. You're not gonna
hang around here.

14:05.254 --> 14:08.563
All right? All the poonsies are hooked up
or singing "Kumbaya" with the art fags.

14:08.663 --> 14:11.017
Any other time,
I'm there, all right?

14:11.117 --> 14:12.701
I just have a lot
on my mind.

14:12.801 --> 14:14.870
You want a Zoloft, man?
I think I got one.

14:14.970 --> 14:17.862
- I just wanna chill.
- Chill when you're dead, man.

14:17.962 --> 14:19.237
Come on.

14:19.337 --> 14:21.546
You're going off to Stanford.
I'm off to Penn.

14:21.646 --> 14:25.351
Phil's off to wherever
the fuck he's going, right?

14:25.451 --> 14:27.053
As your personal physician,

14:27.153 --> 14:29.632
I insist you put that
big brain of yours to rest

14:29.732 --> 14:33.584
and go a little nuts,
okay, for once.

14:49.579 --> 14:52.013
Rise and shine, faggot.

14:53.992 --> 14:55.727
Wharton, motherfucker!
Wharton!

14:55.827 --> 14:57.460
Whoop-whoop, Wharton!

14:57.560 --> 15:00.423
You're gonna be the first dealer
on your block with an MBA.

15:00.523 --> 15:03.101
Yeah, fuck all that, man.
I'm getting out of pharmaceuticals.

15:03.201 --> 15:05.270
Human cloning
is about to explode, dude.

15:05.370 --> 15:08.111
Keep everything offshore,
do your marketing on the Internet.

15:08.211 --> 15:10.954
Promise me you
won't clone yourself.

15:13.505 --> 15:16.584
You know, when you get out of Stanford,
man, I could use you on my team.

15:16.684 --> 15:18.000
What do you say?

15:18.100 --> 15:20.295
Feel like being
a rich son of a bitch?

15:23.521 --> 15:26.319
Is that really
the best we can do?

15:26.419 --> 15:28.451
What? Get rich?

15:29.627 --> 15:31.060
Yeah.

15:32.229 --> 15:34.331
We could do worse.

15:38.448 --> 15:40.342
For example.

15:41.276 --> 15:43.246
What's going on?

15:46.051 --> 15:48.158
Well, your mother and I
were just discussing

15:48.258 --> 15:51.915
how disappointed we were you couldn't
get into a decent law school.

15:52.921 --> 15:54.719
What's wrong with Austin?

15:54.819 --> 15:56.814
It's in the top 100.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.783
One hundred what?

16:13.756 --> 16:15.690
Oh! Hey!

16:20.393 --> 16:21.826
Hot car!

16:33.586 --> 16:37.061
Welcome to the happiest
place on Earth.

16:48.894 --> 16:50.919
Hey, chickie!

16:52.197 --> 16:54.798
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, gringo, hello!

16:54.898 --> 16:58.137
Welcome to Mexico. I have a surprise
for you, you know?

16:58.237 --> 17:01.480
Three beers for a buck.
Hey, I have three VIP passes for you.

17:01.580 --> 17:02.948
- Come on, eh?
- All right.

17:03.048 --> 17:04.777
What's up?
Beautiful broads.

17:04.848 --> 17:07.374
Let's go, my friend!

17:07.452 --> 17:10.012
Welcome to Mexico. Hey!
Juan, I got three.

17:27.810 --> 17:30.046
Can you believe this?
That chick back there

17:30.146 --> 17:32.341
just asked me to go back
to her place and grind.

17:32.415 --> 17:34.906
Why didn't I come down here
years ago?

17:34.984 --> 17:36.786
Are you sure
this is what you want?

17:36.886 --> 17:40.055
What, you mean,
uh, sex? Yeah.

17:40.155 --> 17:41.798
But it's your first time.

17:41.898 --> 17:44.151
Don't you want it
to mean something?

17:44.226 --> 17:45.861
It does mean something.

17:45.961 --> 17:48.681
I mean, you guys
are here, right?

17:50.054 --> 17:52.284
What a Hallmark moment.

18:07.013 --> 18:09.015
I'll be right back.

18:09.115 --> 18:11.982
Hold on one minute.

18:15.472 --> 18:17.406
<i>Hola.</i>

18:19.176 --> 18:22.009
<i>Una más cerveza, por favor.</i>

18:23.341 --> 18:24.774
<i>"Fabor. "</i>

18:24.843 --> 18:26.367
Pardon?

18:26.445 --> 18:27.813
<i>"Fabor. "</i>

18:27.913 --> 18:29.930
The V is pronounced
like a B.

18:30.030 --> 18:32.191
<i>"Fabor. Cerbeza. "</i>

18:32.265 --> 18:33.596
Sorry.

18:33.667 --> 18:35.245
My Spanish sucks.

18:35.345 --> 18:38.577
At least you can order a beer
at a strip club.

18:38.677 --> 18:41.497
What else
do you need to know?

18:43.143 --> 18:46.452
She wants 80 for an hour,
and she'll do anal.

18:46.552 --> 18:48.123
Anal?

18:48.223 --> 18:50.158
Who said I want anal?

18:50.258 --> 18:52.055
Well, you got a problem
with anal?

18:52.127 --> 18:54.254
No, I...

18:54.329 --> 18:56.393
You asked her that?

18:56.493 --> 18:59.394
She's a professional, okay?
If I'm paying for her services,

18:59.467 --> 19:02.652
I think I have a right
to know what they include.

19:03.861 --> 19:06.159
She's barely 17, okay?

19:06.230 --> 19:08.221
She's practically
a virgin herself.

19:08.299 --> 19:10.164
Do not pass this up, okay?

19:14.234 --> 19:15.938
I want you
to have a good time.

19:16.038 --> 19:19.044
I want you to grow up.
I want you to be a man.

19:22.611 --> 19:24.238
Hey, wait a minute.

19:24.313 --> 19:25.974
This is for you.

19:26.048 --> 19:27.810
400.

19:27.910 --> 19:30.056
But you already know that.

19:30.156 --> 19:32.570
- I'm talking to you!
- Let me go!

19:33.120 --> 19:35.520
- Now, asshole.
- Fucking bitch!

19:35.590 --> 19:38.184
Why don't you chill, man?
She's no pro.

19:38.953 --> 19:41.122
It's okay.
I can handle it.

19:41.618 --> 19:42.624
It's okay.

19:42.724 --> 19:45.175
This dickless faggot
more your type, Valeria?

19:45.275 --> 19:47.493
Fuck off, Gilberto.

19:49.411 --> 19:52.312
You think you have the balls
for this girl?

19:54.213 --> 19:56.118
I ask you something.

19:56.218 --> 19:57.776
You deaf?

19:57.853 --> 19:59.955
What the fuck's
your problem, man?

20:00.055 --> 20:01.955
Ow! Shit!

20:09.826 --> 20:12.110
That was pretty stupid.

20:12.865 --> 20:16.005
At least now you have a great
story to tell your friends.

20:16.081 --> 20:18.879
What? That I got my ass kicked?

20:18.950 --> 20:24.047
No. How you came to the aid of a poor
and defenseless woman.

20:24.516 --> 20:26.507
Yeah, right.

20:26.607 --> 20:28.821
If it ever gets boring
around here,

20:28.921 --> 20:31.947
you could bat cleanup
for the Astros.

20:33.110 --> 20:35.840
You know, my ex-husband,

20:35.940 --> 20:39.267
he hated the fact
that I could handle myself.

20:39.935 --> 20:41.503
Let me guess.

20:41.603 --> 20:43.127
That's why he's your ex.

20:43.670 --> 20:45.537
I left him,

20:45.637 --> 20:48.314
and I moved here
to Manzanita.

20:50.952 --> 20:52.846
Can I buy you
a drink later?

20:55.883 --> 20:58.342
So you're not afraid
of strong woman?

20:58.442 --> 21:01.248
Only if she's not
swinging a bat at me.

21:08.893 --> 21:10.823
It's okay, don't be afraid.

21:10.923 --> 21:12.424
I'm not.

21:14.712 --> 21:16.257
I mean...

21:17.112 --> 21:20.049
Does that have to be there?

21:20.149 --> 21:21.878
You don't like it?

21:22.363 --> 21:24.949
I do. It's just...

21:25.589 --> 21:28.159
I feel like I'm being watched.

21:38.732 --> 21:40.791
You have a kid?

21:47.715 --> 21:50.050
Oh, I'm so going to hell.

22:07.153 --> 22:09.294
What's her name?

22:09.571 --> 22:11.183
Mati.

22:14.509 --> 22:15.874
Don't cry.

22:18.338 --> 22:20.499
She's beautiful, Amelia.

22:41.081 --> 22:42.776
She likes you.

22:43.950 --> 22:47.705
I'm working with amateurs,
I swear to God.

22:47.805 --> 22:50.724
You almost get yourself cold
over some bangette.

22:50.824 --> 22:53.520
- And you!
- What?

22:53.593 --> 22:55.993
Falling for a hooker?

22:56.093 --> 22:58.627
Come on.
Come on, Phil.

22:58.696 --> 23:00.561
You're killing me.

23:00.631 --> 23:02.765
I like her.
She's sweet. So what?

23:02.865 --> 23:04.728
I thought you wanted
to get laid.

23:04.828 --> 23:07.657
- Her kid was right there.
- So?

23:08.517 --> 23:10.886
I paid 80 bucks
so he could change diapers.

23:10.986 --> 23:12.920
You want your money back?

23:14.587 --> 23:17.690
Here.
Just fucking take it.

23:18.714 --> 23:20.616
I'm going to the bathroom.

23:20.716 --> 23:23.412
Yeah, you do that, putz.

23:24.004 --> 23:26.458
You try to raise them right.

23:28.340 --> 23:30.999
Hey, isn't that
your hot tamale?

23:34.663 --> 23:36.698
That's Valeria.

23:36.798 --> 23:38.959
Try to act halfway civilized
for once.

23:42.738 --> 23:45.375
- <i>Hola.</i>
- <i>Hola.</i>

23:47.885 --> 23:50.831
Um, this is my cousin, Lupe.

23:50.931 --> 23:53.361
Lupe, this is Eduardo.

23:53.461 --> 23:54.971
<i>Hola.</i>

23:55.798 --> 23:57.670
<i>Hola.</i>

24:00.962 --> 24:02.896
What is up with your cousin?

24:02.996 --> 24:06.730
She's just, uh, traditional.

24:07.239 --> 24:11.738
Tell her that 'shrooms
are nature's way of saying hi.

24:14.803 --> 24:17.182
What? Not for you?

24:17.282 --> 24:19.217
I'm really not big
on hallucinogens.

24:19.317 --> 24:21.282
He's afraid
he'll jump off a building

24:21.382 --> 24:23.294
or go Leatherface on somebody.

24:23.394 --> 24:26.023
- Oh, there you are.
- Come on.

24:27.536 --> 24:29.961
- Come on, Ed.
- All right.

24:30.061 --> 24:31.996
- Yeah, Ed!
- All right.

24:32.096 --> 24:33.364
I like her.

24:33.464 --> 24:35.364
All right.

24:36.272 --> 24:38.489
- These are fuckin' nasty.
- Don't throw up, okay?

24:38.589 --> 24:40.264
You guys wanna get stoned?

24:40.364 --> 24:41.786
Fuck, yeah!

25:30.550 --> 25:32.272
Hey, dude!

25:32.372 --> 25:34.516
You almost done in there?

25:35.077 --> 25:37.829
They're gonna start charging you rent!

25:43.074 --> 25:45.812
Not a moment too soon.

26:25.905 --> 26:28.225
<i>You scored, amigo.</i>

26:29.375 --> 26:31.400
You know what you should do?

26:31.477 --> 26:34.152
Invite her up to Palo Alto.

26:34.252 --> 26:36.883
I'm not going to Palo Alto.

26:37.468 --> 26:39.436
What do you mean?

26:39.504 --> 26:42.240
I'm bailing on Stanford.

26:42.340 --> 26:44.877
I never sent my letter back.

26:52.091 --> 26:54.657
Hey, dudes, I'm, uh...
I'm getting out of here.

26:54.757 --> 26:56.862
I wanna give this to Mati.

26:56.962 --> 26:58.530
Dude, you're tripping.

26:58.630 --> 26:59.961
No, no, no.
I'm fine, really.

27:00.061 --> 27:01.934
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.
You're not leaving.

27:02.034 --> 27:03.899
No, I'm a fifth wheel.

27:03.969 --> 27:08.113
I'll just catch a cab and, you know,
catch up with you guys later.

27:21.654 --> 27:23.485
Gonna beat me.

27:23.556 --> 27:26.423
<i>- That's my grandfather.
- Oh, sorry, senor.</i>

27:31.294 --> 27:32.955
This is amazing.

27:33.055 --> 27:35.922
All these flowers.
It's not depressing at all.

27:35.991 --> 27:39.483
- It should be, but...
- Do you think death's sad?

27:39.561 --> 27:41.654
Don't you?

27:44.157 --> 27:48.025
I think that life,
when it's not fully lived...

27:51.197 --> 27:54.530
is... much sadder.

28:02.937 --> 28:04.802
- Come on.
- You're going down.

28:04.873 --> 28:07.060
There is no God.

28:07.823 --> 28:10.849
Most people are terrified
by that thought.

28:11.796 --> 28:13.863
I find it
very comforting.

28:13.963 --> 28:16.860
There is no one God.
There are many.

28:17.765 --> 28:19.390
I'm sorry. What?

28:20.523 --> 28:22.821
I said

28:22.892 --> 28:24.860
there is no one god.

28:24.960 --> 28:28.623
There are many,
and they live among us.

28:32.537 --> 28:35.039
It's weird,

28:35.139 --> 28:39.166
but ever since
we crossed the border,

28:40.949 --> 28:43.320
I don't feel like me anymore.

28:44.524 --> 28:46.457
Who do you feel like?

28:48.932 --> 28:50.923
Myself.

28:56.291 --> 28:57.815
I think...

28:57.892 --> 29:00.417
you're high.

29:02.106 --> 29:03.733
- Really.
- Really?

29:03.808 --> 29:06.299
Yeah.

29:20.881 --> 29:22.896
- Hey! Got a light?
- Fuck!

29:23.974 --> 29:26.561
Oh, you scared
the shit out of me.

29:26.661 --> 29:28.450
Oh, sorry.

29:41.619 --> 29:43.416
Thanks.

29:48.249 --> 29:51.407
Oh, man,
you don't look so good.

29:52.035 --> 29:53.706
I'm peaking.

29:53.806 --> 29:55.649
What?

30:04.290 --> 30:08.158
Look, my friends and I
can give you a ride.

30:09.195 --> 30:10.353
Yeah?

30:10.453 --> 30:13.066
What's your name, anyway?

30:14.018 --> 30:16.344
<i>- Phillip.
- Ándale.</i>

30:19.018 --> 30:20.451
Hey.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.587
Come in.

30:26.674 --> 30:28.665
Hey, come in.

30:32.592 --> 30:35.507
Come in.
Come in.

30:41.355 --> 30:43.983
This is my friend, Phillip.

30:44.058 --> 30:46.023
He's an American.

30:58.115 --> 31:01.213
You know what?
I'm gonna walk anyway.

31:44.597 --> 31:46.861
Get up, you shit ball.

31:52.607 --> 31:54.475
What time is it?

31:55.907 --> 31:57.772
I don't know.

31:57.842 --> 31:59.867
10:00 or...

32:08.174 --> 32:11.125
Phil didn't make it back
last night.

32:12.185 --> 32:14.017
Yeah?

32:17.741 --> 32:19.971
I thought you wanted
to get an early start.

32:22.312 --> 32:24.337
Ten more minutes.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.288
You rode her bareback?

32:36.388 --> 32:38.856
Dude, I cannot believe it.
You of all people.

32:38.956 --> 32:40.789
That's why I don't 'shroom.

32:40.859 --> 32:43.726
So? You nailed her the way
that nature intended it.

32:43.796 --> 32:46.128
You tapped into the beast.
Dude, I'm proud of you.

32:46.198 --> 32:48.189
Suppose she gets pregnant
or I get AIDS?

32:48.267 --> 32:50.258
Would that make you proud?

32:51.518 --> 32:53.918
How do you get
through life, huh?

32:53.987 --> 32:55.978
By using my head.

32:58.522 --> 33:00.955
Oh, yeah? Then tell me how
the fuck blowing off Stanford

33:01.055 --> 33:03.412
is using your head.

33:06.216 --> 33:08.207
You wouldn't understand.

33:10.754 --> 33:12.813
Try me.

33:15.024 --> 33:16.894
Look, he knows
we wanted to leave early.

33:16.994 --> 33:18.562
What the fuck
is wrong with him?

33:18.662 --> 33:20.527
Did you try his cell?

33:20.597 --> 33:22.690
There's no service.

33:35.541 --> 33:37.031
So what are you gonna do?

33:37.938 --> 33:39.825
I got a few ideas.

33:41.775 --> 33:43.402
Like?

33:44.545 --> 33:47.173
Working for
this volunteer group.

33:48.615 --> 33:51.492
The International Relief Corps.

33:51.592 --> 33:54.844
They're building these irrigation canals
down in Malawi,

33:54.944 --> 33:57.411
and they need
some help organizing.

33:57.511 --> 33:59.193
You fucking with me?

33:59.293 --> 34:00.954
No.

34:04.481 --> 34:06.506
That's... That's beautiful, man!

34:06.606 --> 34:08.152
What are you gonna do next?

34:08.252 --> 34:11.619
Buy a Volvo and join
the fucking Democratic party?

34:12.286 --> 34:14.686
Jesus, Eddie.

34:14.755 --> 34:16.723
I thought I knew you.

34:18.511 --> 34:21.550
You turned into
a fucking softball.

34:31.405 --> 34:33.219
You awake in there?

34:33.320 --> 34:34.657
Hey!

34:47.656 --> 34:49.317
Phillip, right?

34:51.248 --> 34:53.518
I looked at your passport.

34:54.335 --> 34:56.205
I'm Randall.

34:56.304 --> 34:58.809
It's nice to meet you.

35:03.740 --> 35:05.519
You thirsty?

35:18.072 --> 35:20.412
Where the fuck am I?

35:20.512 --> 35:22.599
The other side of the rainbow.

35:28.705 --> 35:31.975
It's a little melted,
but chocolate's good for you.

35:32.075 --> 35:33.667
Here.

35:38.051 --> 35:39.916
Sorry about the smell.

35:39.986 --> 35:41.817
You get used to it.

35:42.318 --> 35:44.157
Hey!

35:44.257 --> 35:47.064
Get out of here!
Little shits.

35:52.397 --> 35:53.386
Hey...

35:54.981 --> 35:56.454
What do you want with me?

35:57.035 --> 35:59.503
<i>You're the man
of the hour, amigo.</i>

35:59.571 --> 36:01.951
You're gonna get to
meet Papa real soon.

36:02.051 --> 36:04.240
He's an amazing man.

36:04.340 --> 36:06.179
Yeah. You just sit tight, relax.

36:06.279 --> 36:08.313
You need anything,
you just ask me, all right?

36:08.381 --> 36:10.246
Food, water,
whatever you want.

36:10.317 --> 36:12.125
You'll be good.

36:13.167 --> 36:15.490
You like to watch television?

36:15.590 --> 36:18.108
I think I got an extra television
laying around here somewhere.

36:18.208 --> 36:22.080
Reception sucks, but it beats
thinking about shit.

36:22.148 --> 36:24.912
Dude, wait. Hey, hey!

36:24.984 --> 36:26.975
Hey, who are you guys?

36:27.053 --> 36:28.315
Hey!

36:28.924 --> 36:31.206
Who are you guys?

36:31.306 --> 36:33.706
What am I doing here?

36:40.017 --> 36:42.212
<i>Our amigo is missing.</i>

36:42.286 --> 36:45.646
Do you understand?
Missing.

36:45.746 --> 36:47.147
So what's the problem?

36:47.740 --> 36:50.432
Excuse me. Does anybody
here speak English?

36:50.532 --> 36:51.704
<i>Inglés?</i>

36:51.804 --> 36:53.211
<i>- Sí.
- Sí. Inglés.</i>

36:53.311 --> 36:55.653
<i>- You speak a little Inglés?
- No.</i>

37:00.535 --> 37:02.696
<i>Un momento.</i>

37:04.550 --> 37:06.381
Get out of here!

37:06.452 --> 37:08.511
Not until I talk to Ramirez.

37:08.587 --> 37:10.817
Get the hell out of here!

37:10.889 --> 37:14.154
- I'm not leaving until Ramirez leaves.
- Rodriguez!

37:14.226 --> 37:16.285
- Rodriguez.
- Yes, Commander.

37:16.385 --> 37:18.574
- Let him pass.
- Yes, sir.

37:21.574 --> 37:23.974
Get your animals out of here.

37:28.144 --> 37:32.112
Just look at the evidence,
that's all I'm asking.

37:32.212 --> 37:33.726
Look!

37:42.028 --> 37:44.179
Welcome to the turd world.

37:44.279 --> 37:45.761
<i>Sí? Uh, yes?</i>

37:46.223 --> 37:48.266
- You speak English?
- Yes, a little.

37:48.366 --> 37:50.840
Oh, man, I'm glad to see you.

37:50.940 --> 37:53.099
They robbed a grave last night.

37:53.199 --> 37:55.086
They stole a child's body.

37:55.186 --> 37:57.314
It's for Santillan's Nganga!

37:57.414 --> 38:00.340
They're preparing it for his arrival.

38:09.964 --> 38:15.766
You asked me to listen to your story,
and I have.

38:16.896 --> 38:19.130
Forget about your partner.

38:19.640 --> 38:24.202
This isn't Mexico City;
this isn't even Mexico.

38:25.076 --> 38:26.805
This is the border.

38:28.729 --> 38:31.347
The border has no memory.

38:32.666 --> 38:34.361
Remembering here...

38:35.961 --> 38:38.529
gets you killed.

38:44.410 --> 38:47.538
Look, something happened to him,
and he's not banging some girl.

38:47.613 --> 38:49.015
So what are you
gonna do about it?

38:49.115 --> 38:52.141
I'm sorry. Until your friend is missing
for at least 72 hours,

38:52.218 --> 38:54.743
there is nothing we can do.

38:54.820 --> 38:56.931
Don't worry.
He'll turn up.

38:57.031 --> 38:58.157
Fuck!

38:58.257 --> 39:00.097
I never should've let him go.

39:00.197 --> 39:02.461
We're... We're gonna
have to call his parents.

39:02.561 --> 39:04.791
What, and tell them
we let him wander off

39:04.863 --> 39:06.990
high on 'shrooms
to find a hooker?

39:07.066 --> 39:09.683
Just give it another
couple hours, okay?

39:20.646 --> 39:23.274
Do I have any messages?

40:13.204 --> 40:16.551
Henry's staking out the hotel
in case he shows.

40:16.651 --> 40:18.743
Other than that,
there's not much we can do.

40:18.843 --> 40:21.252
I'm fucked,
and it's all my fault.

40:21.352 --> 40:25.061
Maybe someone in this girl Amelia's
neighborhood saw something.

40:25.161 --> 40:27.106
You could ask around.

40:27.206 --> 40:28.949
With my Spanish?

40:30.475 --> 40:34.368
No. With mine.

40:36.532 --> 40:37.999
Come on.

41:01.940 --> 41:03.271
Lupe.

41:04.613 --> 41:07.275
Do you know what this is for?

41:07.349 --> 41:09.814
It's for the Disappeared.

41:11.761 --> 41:13.695
What did she say?

41:14.755 --> 41:16.416
I'm not sure in English.

41:16.516 --> 41:19.891
It's, like,
those who have vanished.

41:42.210 --> 41:43.541
Where are you from?

41:45.034 --> 41:47.298
A little shit hole
called San Anton.

41:47.398 --> 41:49.274
Oh, yeah?

41:49.374 --> 41:51.976
Hey, do you know
Vinnie's Pizza?

41:52.633 --> 41:53.930
On Alvarez?

41:56.729 --> 41:58.353
The best pies in Texas.

41:58.453 --> 42:00.730
Yeah.

42:01.605 --> 42:04.267
It's the one thing I miss
being over here.

42:04.367 --> 42:07.037
One thing I don't miss:
American women.

42:07.110 --> 42:09.279
The most stuck-up bitches
on Earth.

42:09.379 --> 42:11.999
Couldn't get play there
to save my life.

42:12.681 --> 42:15.075
That's hard to believe.

42:19.695 --> 42:21.263
You messing with me?

42:21.363 --> 42:22.762
No.

42:25.750 --> 42:28.803
There's three bitches in Los Angeles
and two in Phoenix that messed with me.

42:28.903 --> 42:31.183
They're still looking for the bodies.

42:31.283 --> 42:33.364
Know what I mean, jelly bean?

42:34.610 --> 42:38.013
Listen, my parents
have a little money.

42:38.113 --> 42:40.571
If I can just make a phone call.

42:41.500 --> 42:43.325
It's not about that, home-style.

42:43.425 --> 42:45.723
What is it about?

42:47.112 --> 42:49.060
The spirits.

42:49.814 --> 42:51.377
Spirits?

42:52.800 --> 42:55.418
The whole world
is alive with spirits.

43:00.259 --> 43:03.123
Before I knew
about this place, right?

43:03.223 --> 43:06.263
If I fucked somebody up...
you know, I killed them or whatever,

43:06.339 --> 43:08.041
'cause they pissed me off,

43:08.141 --> 43:10.043
or I just felt the urge
that day, you know?

43:10.143 --> 43:12.168
Then Papa,

43:12.245 --> 43:14.338
he showed me another way.

43:14.414 --> 43:16.939
He taught me how
to use that urge.

43:17.017 --> 43:19.194
You know?
How to channel it.

43:19.853 --> 43:21.946
Connect with the spirits.

43:23.435 --> 43:25.426
I'm talking about Palo.

43:27.233 --> 43:30.106
Palo-Mayombe.

43:30.175 --> 43:33.081
It's supposed to be
some shit from Africa.

43:34.270 --> 43:37.390
Yeah, but what does that
have to do with me?

43:37.490 --> 43:40.118
Papa's gonna use you
to talk to him.

43:40.992 --> 43:42.796
He needs you.

43:42.896 --> 43:45.265
This is big, home-style.

43:45.365 --> 43:47.196
Don't you get it?

43:48.298 --> 43:50.336
Your life's gonna change.

43:50.436 --> 43:53.200
It's gonna mean something.

43:59.016 --> 44:00.461
I can feel it.

44:00.561 --> 44:03.354
There's something in the air.
Something poisonous.

44:03.454 --> 44:06.191
I've only been here two months,
but this is different.

44:06.291 --> 44:09.289
You know, you live in
a really screwed-up country.

44:09.389 --> 44:10.755
No offense.

44:10.855 --> 44:13.264
I guess nobody ever
gets kidnapped in the U.S.

44:13.364 --> 44:15.229
Hey, we don't know
if he's been kidnapped.

44:15.329 --> 44:16.506
What, then?

44:17.109 --> 44:18.741
What's wrong?

44:19.450 --> 44:21.139
Car's just sitting there.

44:21.239 --> 44:23.443
Driver's been staring at us.

44:23.543 --> 44:26.692
Green piece of shit's been
hanging out since I got here.

44:26.792 --> 44:28.927
Look, don't get paranoid.

44:29.027 --> 44:31.427
Maybe he's waiting
for his girlfriend.

44:39.591 --> 44:42.571
You got an issue, asshole?

44:44.440 --> 44:47.341
- Go home, whitey.
- That's Phil's.

44:48.028 --> 44:49.880
Hey.
Hey!

44:51.481 --> 44:53.915
Son of a bitch!

44:57.971 --> 44:59.939
Oh, my God!

45:04.748 --> 45:06.306
Hey!

45:07.651 --> 45:10.643
Is anybody out there?

45:10.743 --> 45:12.746
Randall?

45:13.443 --> 45:15.536
Hello!

45:17.213 --> 45:18.646
What's your problem?

45:19.297 --> 45:20.706
I gotta piss.

45:20.783 --> 45:22.774
You just went.

45:22.852 --> 45:25.013
I mean, I gotta shit.

45:25.088 --> 45:27.330
You want me
to shit my pants?

45:44.602 --> 45:47.456
Got some pretty brave friends.
You know that?

45:47.556 --> 45:49.223
What do you mean?

45:49.996 --> 45:53.230
Poking their nose where
they shouldn't be poking it.

45:53.330 --> 45:55.484
That's a good way
to lose your nose...

45:55.584 --> 45:58.042
and plenty more.

46:02.583 --> 46:05.987
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You gotta undo my pants, too.

46:06.087 --> 46:08.574
Do I look like
some kind of homo?

46:10.929 --> 46:12.997
Fucking beaners.

46:13.097 --> 46:15.840
Always give me the shit jobs
just because I'm illegal.

46:15.940 --> 46:17.647
It's discrimination.

46:40.963 --> 46:42.521
Fuck.

46:47.351 --> 46:51.287
Come here, you son of a bitch!

47:11.774 --> 47:13.071
Come here!

47:40.928 --> 47:43.522
Hey! Hey!

47:43.597 --> 47:47.795
Please! Wait!

48:04.098 --> 48:05.656
No!

48:26.849 --> 48:29.138
Come here!

48:29.717 --> 48:33.563
You try that again,
I will blow your ass away!

48:33.663 --> 48:36.319
- Understand?
- Yes. Yes.

48:37.970 --> 48:40.557
You just lost
your TV privileges, bitch.

48:43.436 --> 48:45.420
Chain him up.

49:17.967 --> 49:20.603
The drug runners on the farm,

49:20.703 --> 49:23.137
they are followers
of Palo-Mayombe.

49:23.206 --> 49:26.607
And their priest is a man
called Santillan.

49:33.888 --> 49:35.822
A week ago,

49:37.693 --> 49:40.224
two of his people
were in the store.

49:40.324 --> 49:43.183
I overheard them talking.

49:43.283 --> 49:45.927
They were looking
for a gringo.

49:51.920 --> 49:54.223
- Yes, ma'am?
- Are you open?

49:54.323 --> 49:55.415
Yes.

49:55.491 --> 49:56.990
I want to buy something.

49:57.090 --> 49:58.536
Come in.

50:04.405 --> 50:06.748
I'll take care later.

50:19.925 --> 50:23.122
If Santillan took your friend,

50:23.195 --> 50:25.425
there is nothing you can do.

50:25.497 --> 50:26.898
So what are you saying?

50:26.998 --> 50:28.761
We should bail
on a fellow marine

50:28.833 --> 50:31.693
because of some lame-ass
Mexican voodoo cult?

50:31.793 --> 50:36.164
They tell people
that their souls are dead,

50:36.264 --> 50:38.399
like they're proud.

50:38.499 --> 50:41.957
People like that,
they are capable of anything.

50:45.441 --> 50:48.978
Stay away from these boys, Valeria.

50:49.078 --> 50:50.670
It is dangerous.

50:52.441 --> 50:54.974
Excuse me, but
don't youhave incense?

50:55.074 --> 50:57.110
<i>Sí, senora.</i>

50:57.210 --> 50:59.047
I'll get it.

51:23.240 --> 51:25.333
Henry, hold on.
Don't fuck with these guys.

51:25.433 --> 51:27.968
- I'm tired of being jerked around.
- We should go to the police.

51:28.068 --> 51:29.944
Fuck the police!
They're fucking useless!

51:30.044 --> 51:32.777
Would you chill the fuck out?
This is not the way to handle it.

51:32.849 --> 51:35.145
Maybe we should consult
with our allies, and the U.N.

51:35.245 --> 51:36.933
You're only gonna
make it worse.

51:37.033 --> 51:39.656
Worse than it already is?
You know what you are, Eddie?

51:39.756 --> 51:41.658
Bottom line,
you're a chickenshit.

51:41.758 --> 51:43.788
That's why you're
running off to Africa.

51:43.888 --> 51:46.913
You wanna fuck with somebody, huh?
How about me, bitch?

51:47.013 --> 51:50.252
Me, FBI, CIA,
Army Rangers.

51:50.328 --> 51:54.094
Get that nasty bitch from
Abu Ghraib down here, huh?

52:00.303 --> 52:02.532
Looks like he's dead, huh?

52:03.638 --> 52:06.139
- You'll see, bastard.
- Please...

52:06.208 --> 52:08.024
No! Please, please...

52:09.444 --> 52:11.674
Please, please...

52:11.747 --> 52:14.580
- Hey!
- Go fuck your mother, faggot.

52:16.051 --> 52:17.279
Hey!

52:17.352 --> 52:19.684
What's going on?

52:22.702 --> 52:24.856
Where the fuck are they going?

52:41.577 --> 52:43.364
Doctor said I'm lucky.

52:44.100 --> 52:46.747
<i>Another inch,
and I'd be adios, muchachos.</i>

52:48.996 --> 52:51.919
Try one between
your fucking eyes.

52:55.116 --> 52:59.485
So I tell him about Phil
and this Santillan dude.

53:00.488 --> 53:02.223
The guy goes
white as a sheet,

53:02.323 --> 53:04.655
says he doesn't know
what I'm talking about.

53:04.726 --> 53:07.371
Then he gives me this

53:07.471 --> 53:09.290
for my protection.

53:11.419 --> 53:14.786
Well, that's all, folks.

53:14.856 --> 53:16.716
<i>I'm hasta la vista.</i>

53:16.816 --> 53:18.725
Jesus, Henry, come on.
You've just been shot.

53:18.793 --> 53:21.347
- Think for once.
- I am.

53:24.647 --> 53:27.617
But I'm thinking these guys
are gonna come back

53:27.717 --> 53:30.013
and finish what they started.

53:30.621 --> 53:32.945
And even the cops
are scared of them.

53:33.022 --> 53:34.887
You saw.

53:34.957 --> 53:38.290
Look, if we stay here,
we're sitting ducks.

53:39.196 --> 53:41.520
What about Phil?

53:44.359 --> 53:45.840
He's dead.

53:45.940 --> 53:47.904
He's dead, man.

53:47.973 --> 53:50.810
Do you have a friend
who disappear?

53:50.910 --> 53:54.156
Dark hair, 20, 21?

53:56.268 --> 53:58.244
He is alive.

54:13.884 --> 54:15.519
My love.

54:15.619 --> 54:17.127
What are you doing here?

54:17.227 --> 54:19.182
I wanted to see the gringo.

54:20.391 --> 54:22.825
You've seen him. Now go.

54:34.472 --> 54:36.502
Who did this to you?

54:55.879 --> 54:57.676
Listen to me very carefully.

55:00.150 --> 55:03.940
If you touch another hair
on his head...

55:04.040 --> 55:08.347
I will decorate my bedroom wall
with your skin.

55:12.744 --> 55:15.933
- Understand?
- Yes.

55:16.033 --> 55:18.591
I'm sorry, boss.

55:18.691 --> 55:20.532
I'm sorry.

55:29.565 --> 55:34.161
I do not believe in violence
that has no purpose.

55:34.690 --> 55:37.490
I've tried to teach that
to Randall, but...

55:37.590 --> 55:40.318
he's American,
so it's hard.

55:43.265 --> 55:45.147
What's gonna happen to me?

55:45.247 --> 55:47.163
None of your fucking business.

55:47.263 --> 55:48.852
It's okay.

55:57.917 --> 56:01.302
<i>In the past,
I've always used Mejicanos.</i>

56:01.402 --> 56:03.512
But the last one,

56:03.612 --> 56:06.326
he was very brave,

56:06.426 --> 56:09.224
very stubborn.

56:14.097 --> 56:17.931
So when the time came,
he refused to cooperate,

56:18.935 --> 56:21.426
so the magic was bad.

56:22.679 --> 56:25.536
The gods were...

56:25.636 --> 56:27.840
unmoved.

56:27.911 --> 56:29.711
I decided...

56:29.811 --> 56:31.903
next time,

56:32.003 --> 56:34.494
<i>instead of using a Mejicano,</i>

56:35.802 --> 56:38.405
I would use an American.

56:39.379 --> 56:44.476
Someone young and... soft.

56:47.142 --> 56:49.007
Someone...

56:49.077 --> 56:51.705
who will give me
what I need.

56:54.252 --> 56:56.341
What's that?

57:07.195 --> 57:08.287
Screams.

57:08.363 --> 57:11.502
Please, I just want
to go home!

57:11.602 --> 57:13.093
No!

57:20.756 --> 57:24.960
Before Santillan smuggles
his drugs to the north,

57:25.060 --> 57:27.510
he makes his drugs

57:27.610 --> 57:30.618
invisible to
the border police.

57:30.718 --> 57:33.466
To do this, he make...

57:34.738 --> 57:38.401
<i>How do you say,
"un escudo mágico de sangre"?</i>

57:38.501 --> 57:41.958
A magical shield of blood?

57:42.058 --> 57:43.603
Human blood.

57:44.214 --> 57:45.704
What?

57:45.782 --> 57:47.647
In return for the gods' protection,

57:47.717 --> 57:49.800
he gives to them a sacrifice.

57:49.900 --> 57:51.561
What the fuck?

57:51.661 --> 57:53.771
Are you saying Phil's
gonna get murdered?

57:53.871 --> 57:55.736
Santillan arrived this afternoon.

57:55.836 --> 57:58.036
He will perform his ritual tonight.

57:58.109 --> 57:59.804
On the full moon.

57:59.877 --> 58:01.421
So what do we do?

58:01.521 --> 58:04.098
Go to the American FBI.
Tell your story.

58:04.198 --> 58:07.154
Give to them my evidence
of Santillan and his operation.

58:07.254 --> 58:09.690
If the Mexican police will
do nothing, maybe yours will.

58:09.790 --> 58:11.815
You said they were
gonna kill him tonight.

58:11.892 --> 58:13.587
That's not enough time.

58:15.228 --> 58:17.607
I know where is your friend.

58:17.707 --> 58:21.547
I go to the farm, do what I can.

58:21.647 --> 58:24.737
We meet in your hotel
in a half hour.

58:24.837 --> 58:26.962
I'll bring the evidence.

58:47.132 --> 58:49.278
Maybe we should go with him.

58:57.727 --> 58:59.999
You know I love Phil, right?

59:02.832 --> 59:03.924
Yeah.

59:04.000 --> 59:07.595
Okay, I bust his chops
sometimes, but...

59:08.687 --> 59:11.399
I thought I was gonna
buy it, Eddie.

59:14.280 --> 59:16.059
Now,

59:16.159 --> 59:19.319
you wanna call me a chickenshit,
you go ahead.

59:20.047 --> 59:22.354
I got it coming.

59:25.685 --> 59:28.944
I'll say it myself, dude.
I'm fucking scared.

59:42.418 --> 59:44.648
I'm gonna drop Valeria off,

59:44.748 --> 59:46.951
then come back.

59:48.603 --> 59:50.508
All right.

59:57.652 --> 59:59.415
Ed, listen, man.

01:00:01.423 --> 01:00:03.084
What I said earlier...

01:00:04.204 --> 01:00:07.653
You wanna dig ditches
in Africa for no money,

01:00:07.753 --> 01:00:11.229
if you ask me,
you're fucking crazy, but...

01:00:13.752 --> 01:00:16.152
takes balls.

01:01:28.259 --> 01:01:30.625
Oh!

01:02:16.978 --> 01:02:19.735
Look, maybe you'd better
come with us.

01:02:19.835 --> 01:02:21.198
I can't.

01:02:21.298 --> 01:02:23.749
It's not safe here, Valeria.

01:02:23.849 --> 01:02:27.351
Are you going to smuggle me
across the border?

01:02:31.045 --> 01:02:32.706
All right.

01:02:34.582 --> 01:02:37.756
I'll be back as soon
as I know what we're doing.

01:02:38.457 --> 01:02:40.201
I'll be here.

01:03:23.024 --> 01:03:24.389
Valeria!

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:55.368
Get off me!

01:04:22.293 --> 01:04:23.712
What's going on?

01:04:23.812 --> 01:04:27.001
I don't know. I have no idea.

01:04:39.058 --> 01:04:40.685
Hello!

01:05:13.776 --> 01:05:15.437
Shit!

01:05:22.544 --> 01:05:24.671
Fuck!

01:05:35.514 --> 01:05:36.845
Shit!

01:05:39.271 --> 01:05:42.007
Fuck! Fuck!

01:05:42.107 --> 01:05:45.133
Help me! Somebody, help!

01:05:46.144 --> 01:05:49.545
Help me! Help!

01:05:50.882 --> 01:05:52.543
Open the door, lady!
They're gonna kill me!

01:05:52.617 --> 01:05:55.313
<i>- Open the fucking door, lady!
- Ayl</i>

01:06:00.859 --> 01:06:03.054
Don't fucking open it!

01:07:02.062 --> 01:07:03.290
Fuck!

01:07:10.522 --> 01:07:13.685
Help! Help me!

01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:43.932
Enough. Come on.

01:09:10.429 --> 01:09:13.457
She didn't want to talk.

01:09:13.535 --> 01:09:15.371
I made her.
I made her talk!

01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:17.453
She didn't want to talk!

01:09:37.684 --> 01:09:39.652
Henry.

01:09:48.671 --> 01:09:50.399
What... What happened?
Is it Henry?

01:09:50.473 --> 01:09:51.799
- Yes.
- Where is he?

01:09:51.899 --> 01:09:53.073
On the roof.

01:09:53.142 --> 01:09:55.872
Hey, guy, you don't
want to see him.

01:09:59.963 --> 01:10:03.241
- You can't cross the line, lady.
- What happened?

01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:16.228
Okay, you must go, now.

01:10:17.375 --> 01:10:19.969
I'm coming with you.

01:10:20.044 --> 01:10:21.944
That was not our deal.

01:10:22.013 --> 01:10:23.663
I don't care about our deal.

01:10:23.763 --> 01:10:26.109
He's my friend.

01:10:57.213 --> 01:10:59.000
What's going on?

01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:01.048
Showtime, girl.

01:11:06.204 --> 01:11:07.535
It's all right.

01:11:25.004 --> 01:11:26.934
Fuck!

01:11:27.034 --> 01:11:29.215
Okay, okay, okay.

01:12:03.561 --> 01:12:05.995
So what do we do
when we get there?

01:12:06.676 --> 01:12:07.636
"We"?

01:12:07.736 --> 01:12:10.060
You want me
to help you, right?

01:12:10.134 --> 01:12:12.170
- Ever fired a gun?
- Yeah.

01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:14.215
Yeah, I've fired a gun.

01:12:16.391 --> 01:12:18.625
How about shoot a man?

01:12:18.725 --> 01:12:20.467
Ever do that?

01:12:21.485 --> 01:12:23.962
Think you could?

01:12:26.405 --> 01:12:28.309
Yeah.

01:12:28.409 --> 01:12:30.375
If I had to.

01:13:02.915 --> 01:13:04.516
Is everyone here?

01:13:04.616 --> 01:13:05.981
Everybody.

01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:10.146
Then let's begin.

01:14:02.255 --> 01:14:04.734
Now we wake Chango.

01:14:49.153 --> 01:14:52.526
"Though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

01:14:52.626 --> 01:14:54.441
"I will fear no evil,

01:14:54.541 --> 01:14:56.663
"for Thou art with me.

01:14:56.763 --> 01:14:59.962
"Thy rod and Thy staff,
they comfort me.

01:15:03.447 --> 01:15:05.881
"Thou preparest
a meal for me

01:15:05.950 --> 01:15:09.078
"in the presence
of my enemy.

01:15:09.153 --> 01:15:12.078
Thou annointest my head
with oil. "

01:15:12.178 --> 01:15:17.757
- Hear me, Chango. Hear my prayer.
- "My cup runneth over. "

01:15:17.828 --> 01:15:20.763
I bring you flesh that bleeds.
A heart that beats in fear.

01:15:20.831 --> 01:15:23.900
"Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
all the days of my life,"

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.025
A soul that cries out in pain.

01:15:26.125 --> 01:15:28.296
"And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever. "

01:15:28.396 --> 01:15:30.343
If this pleases you,

01:15:30.415 --> 01:15:32.406
Then grant us the power...

01:15:32.484 --> 01:15:34.795
"And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

01:15:34.895 --> 01:15:38.053
...to walk in the daylight,
yet still be in shadow.

01:15:39.074 --> 01:15:42.164
And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever. "

01:16:01.391 --> 01:16:05.054
Help me, God!

01:16:08.081 --> 01:16:10.845
Oh, my God!

01:16:18.558 --> 01:16:21.391
String him up.

01:17:48.384 --> 01:17:50.682
Stay alive.

01:20:05.297 --> 01:20:07.959
It's Phil's.

01:20:09.978 --> 01:20:12.202
Go, go, go!

01:21:07.503 --> 01:21:09.095
<i>Hola.</i>

01:21:09.905 --> 01:21:11.532
Remember me?

01:21:12.802 --> 01:21:15.504
A year ago in Mexico City,

01:21:15.578 --> 01:21:18.547
you had my partner killed,

01:21:18.614 --> 01:21:21.048
but you let me live.

01:21:22.423 --> 01:21:23.947
The cop?

01:21:24.025 --> 01:21:26.584
Piece of shit,

01:21:26.684 --> 01:21:28.920
you should have killed me.

01:21:29.887 --> 01:21:30.854
I did.

01:21:31.856 --> 01:21:34.120
No, you loser!

01:21:42.184 --> 01:21:43.511
Where's the boy?

01:21:43.611 --> 01:21:46.253
His body or his soul?

01:21:46.564 --> 01:21:48.452
You sick son of a bitch.

01:21:54.263 --> 01:21:55.457
Papa!

01:21:55.531 --> 01:21:57.055
Go ahead.

01:21:57.132 --> 01:22:00.101
Pull the trigger. If you have the will.

01:22:02.420 --> 01:22:04.152
You bastard.

01:22:19.322 --> 01:22:23.834
I'm going to feed you to my Nganga.

01:22:23.934 --> 01:22:26.467
You can keep the gringo company.

01:22:45.618 --> 01:22:47.313
Get out!

01:23:00.128 --> 01:23:01.459
Ulises!

01:23:13.491 --> 01:23:15.925
Get out of here, you bastards, get it?

01:23:17.612 --> 01:23:19.262
All right?

01:23:25.273 --> 01:23:27.503
Fuck!

01:23:36.705 --> 01:23:38.735
Stay down!

01:23:41.598 --> 01:23:42.953
Drive!

01:23:56.068 --> 01:23:58.229
Where's the bag?

01:23:58.303 --> 01:24:00.294
Right here.

01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:07.936
You see? Already.

01:24:10.916 --> 01:24:12.948
Hang in there.

01:24:13.048 --> 01:24:15.806
We're gonna get you
some help.

01:24:16.745 --> 01:24:20.579
Ed, tell them my story.

01:24:21.285 --> 01:24:23.135
You're gonna tell it.

01:24:23.733 --> 01:24:25.419
Promise me!

01:25:06.946 --> 01:25:10.746
Hey! Hey, can you please help us?

01:25:10.817 --> 01:25:12.945
A man's been shot.

01:25:16.787 --> 01:25:17.857
<i>Senorl</i>

01:25:17.957 --> 01:25:20.755
Come on! Stay with me.

01:25:35.842 --> 01:25:37.665
His hand is cold.

01:25:56.196 --> 01:25:58.562
No.

01:25:58.632 --> 01:26:00.862
Oh.

01:26:26.576 --> 01:26:28.203
Ask him how far the border is.

01:26:33.773 --> 01:26:35.675
How far away is the border?

01:26:35.775 --> 01:26:37.588
Go out the front door.

01:26:37.688 --> 01:26:40.841
Two kilometers, you'll be in the water.

01:26:46.111 --> 01:26:48.375
He said...

01:26:48.446 --> 01:26:51.143
He said we walk out there,

01:26:51.243 --> 01:26:54.244
go two kilometers
and we're swimming in it.

01:26:54.319 --> 01:26:56.221
Okay. We'll pack some food,

01:26:56.321 --> 01:26:59.229
we'll pack some water,
we're gonna swim across.

What?

01:27:40.554 --> 01:27:42.421
You saw them?

01:27:48.949 --> 01:27:50.897
Shit!

01:27:53.105 --> 01:27:56.005
Listen up,
you sons of bitches!

01:27:56.105 --> 01:27:58.833
You are seriously fucked!

01:27:58.933 --> 01:28:00.799
You have no idea!

01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:03.877
You killed a great man!

01:28:03.977 --> 01:28:05.280
A god!

01:28:07.089 --> 01:28:09.421
I got a bunch of weapons
out here with nothing to lose!

01:28:12.728 --> 01:28:14.491
We're gonna die.

01:28:15.351 --> 01:28:17.830
No, we won't.

01:28:20.002 --> 01:28:22.596
Right. Run.

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:36.925
Ow! Shit!

01:28:42.567 --> 01:28:44.262
Okay, okay, okay.

01:28:48.239 --> 01:28:50.503
You stay here.
I'm gonna check the back.

01:28:50.575 --> 01:28:52.065
Okay.

I promise I'll make it quick!

01:30:40.374 --> 01:30:41.712

01:31:06.837 --> 01:31:08.759
You like that?

01:31:19.155 --> 01:31:20.736
You know what I like to see?

01:31:20.836 --> 01:31:22.899
The look in a cunt's eyes
right before I do it.

01:31:22.999 --> 01:31:24.346
Come on. Open your mouth.

01:31:24.446 --> 01:31:26.114
<i>There you go. Gracias.</i>

01:31:26.214 --> 01:31:27.759
See? You like that?

01:31:27.859 --> 01:31:29.881
I miss something?

01:32:23.469 --> 01:32:25.902

of my ex.

We're going to lift the spirit

01:37:03.801 --> 01:37:06.237
because you don't have to think
about what we can hit.

01:37:06.337 --> 01:37:10.501
Just as the sheath raises those who fall.

01:37:11.170 --> 01:37:14.901
In this city, so full of soul,
finding glory where you leave.
