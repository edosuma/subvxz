we actually didn't
get to talk with him.

03:12.292 --> 03:16.763

yeah. he also says the hit car
was green or red.

hey, boss, you mind very much
if diane stays on ours?

05:47.013 --> 05:50.083
we were with his little girl
till the mother got there.

05:50.083 --> 05:54.387
we didn't really tell her kwasi
was dead. she might not want
to talk to us no more.

05:54.887 --> 05:56.789
no problem.
just give me a second.

05:56.789 --> 05:59.492
okay. let me know if you
need help on canvass.

05:59.726 --> 06:03.763
- okay, lieu.
- can you give us any help
  with kwasi's wife?

06:04.030 --> 06:06.032
no. they must've split up
before i knew him.

06:06.032 --> 06:09.235
she left him early?
maybe she's got some sense.

06:09.736 --> 06:13.306
wait a minute.
that's the last ball-breakin'
about kwasi.

06:13.306 --> 06:15.475
you had this guy up
for sainthood.

06:15.742 --> 06:19.011
i never had him up for
sainthood, and i don't know that
he's coming out of this wrong.

06:19.512 --> 06:22.048
i'm telling you,
you're done pissin' on hydrants
till we find out.

06:22.548 --> 06:24.917

[ man ]
work together on this, guys.

06:32.625 --> 06:35.495
hi, hanna. mrs. torrence.

06:35.495 --> 06:37.445
what do you want
to ask me?

06:37.445 --> 06:41.032
well, we wanted to tell you how
sorry we were about your dad,
first thing.

06:41.032 --> 06:44.285
and we need to talk to you
about what your dad was doing
before he left the apartment.

06:44.285 --> 06:47.956
and there's some other things.
we also need to talk
to your mom.

06:47.956 --> 06:50.625
we wanted to give both of you
a little bit of time to
yourselves before we did that.

06:50.625 --> 06:52.927
so you lied
that he was alive?

06:52.927 --> 06:57.599
-we talked about that, hanna.
- we thought your mom should
  tell you about your dad.

06:57.599 --> 07:00.301
i found out who you are.
i don't want you
talking with her.

07:00.301 --> 07:03.972
this is detective russell.
maybe you could talk with her
while we talk with your mom.

07:03.972 --> 07:09.027
diane russell.
i'm sorry about your dad, hanna.

07:09.027 --> 07:11.613
you want me with you
while you talk to her?

07:11.613 --> 07:14.199
you weren't with daddy.

07:14.199 --> 07:17.485
hanna, um,
why don't we talk back here,
all right?

07:19.454 --> 07:23.124
i don't know if you're hungry,
but we've got some things
in the refrigerator.

07:23.124 --> 07:27.495
-[ hanna ] okay.
-would you feel comfortable
  talking in here?

07:27.495 --> 07:30.215
- or would you rather go
  into an interview room?
- we can talk here.

07:30.215 --> 07:33.301
- right this way.
-[ door creaks ]

07:33.301 --> 07:36.921
- you want me to excuse myself?
- i've dealt with people
  like you before.

07:36.921 --> 07:38.757
it's hanna we were
trying to protect.

07:38.757 --> 07:41.843
ma'am, right here.

07:45.330 --> 07:48.349
do you have any idea
why this happened to
your husband, mrs. torrence?

07:48.349 --> 07:53.238
- no.
- do you know marcus cameron,
  the man who was shot with him?

07:53.238 --> 07:56.608
we didn't have many friends in
common, and we'd been separated
three and a half years.

07:56.608 --> 07:59.277
his street name was prince,
this marcus cameron.
i didn't know him.

07:59.277 --> 08:01.996
do you mind if i ask you
about you and kwasi not having
friends in common?

08:01.996 --> 08:06.251
i'm a nursing supervisor.
it takes a lot of time.
so did hanna.

08:06.251 --> 08:11.122
we found a note in
kwasi's pocket about, uh,
your daughter's baseball game.

08:11.122 --> 08:14.042
he called her aisha.
what do you want
to know about that?

08:14.542 --> 08:17.095
well, actually, i'm interested
to know why you both
call her different names.

08:17.595 --> 08:20.932
don't play detective
games with me, please.
people separate for reasons.

08:20.932 --> 08:24.686
none of the things kwasi
and i disagreed about
had anything to do...

08:24.686 --> 08:27.272
-with your investigation.
- you sure about that?

08:27.272 --> 08:29.607
-i'm sure.
- is that 'cause you know
  why he was murdered?

08:30.108 --> 08:32.477
i know he wasn't murdered
for any of the reasons
you'd like to think.

08:32.477 --> 08:35.313
my husband was an honorable,
good-hearted man,

08:35.313 --> 08:39.366
and he was brave enough
to believe in people others
wanted to keep in the junk heap.

08:39.616 --> 08:43.488
that's what got him killed
somehow-- trying to help.

08:43.488 --> 08:45.657
[ simone ]
what work was kwasi
involved with most recently?

08:45.657 --> 08:50.912
he was involved with hanna.
that's what i know about.
okay.

08:50.912 --> 08:56.134
hanna wants to say
something to her mom.

08:56.634 --> 09:02.090
i'm sorry, mom, for what
i said to you. and i'm sorry
if i hurt your feelings.

09:02.090 --> 09:05.560
it's okay, pumpkin.

09:05.560 --> 09:08.897
please don't be mad at me
and go away too.

09:08.897 --> 09:13.434
come here. it's all right.
i understand.
i'm not going anywhere.

09:13.434 --> 09:16.154
hanna wanted her
mom to know that.

09:16.154 --> 09:19.774
- uh-huh.
-and she was telling me
 about her uncle, too,

09:19.774 --> 09:22.944
and how her dad was
trying to help him.

09:24.279 --> 09:28.199
who was daddy
trying to help?
uncle jerome.

09:28.199 --> 09:31.953
- he called daddy. [ sniffles ]
- jerome's kwasi's brother?

09:31.953 --> 09:34.706
- no.
- my brother.

09:34.706 --> 09:39.878
daddy went to meet him
in his car and said he'd
be back in time for my game.

09:39.878 --> 09:44.015
hanna, did your dad say
what he was trying to help
your uncle about?

09:44.015 --> 09:47.635
no. he just said
he'll be back.

09:50.271 --> 09:54.442
where are we going to find
your brother, mrs. torrence?

09:54.442 --> 09:58.696
i don't know.
i haven't been able
to reach him in two days.

09:58.696 --> 10:02.784
i can show you
where his apartment is.

10:20.101 --> 10:23.571

wandered in from next door,

10:28.276 --> 10:30.995

okay?
now, hanna, your niece--

14:34.238 --> 14:38.659
she puts you with her dad
just before him and another guy
got murdered.

14:38.659 --> 14:41.445
there's a witness
on the scene that said
there was a third guy...

14:41.445 --> 14:44.365
in the car past the two victims,
so we gotta make that guy you.

14:44.866 --> 14:47.251
why did the shooters
let you get away?
were you the setup guy?

14:47.251 --> 14:51.539
- no.
- jerome, say something
  past "no" here, okay?

14:51.539 --> 14:53.841
i'm afraid to say.

14:53.841 --> 14:56.093
well, you're gonna
have to get over that.

14:56.093 --> 14:59.764
'cause i got him killed,
and if more is gonna happen--

14:59.764 --> 15:02.967
- you got kwasi killed?
- yes.

15:02.967 --> 15:06.387
tell us how you think
you got him killed.

15:06.387 --> 15:10.391
i had found some drugs
in my building.

15:10.391 --> 15:13.778
they were hidden
in a boom box
under the landing,

15:13.778 --> 15:18.115
and i called it
to the police attention.
when was this?

15:18.115 --> 15:23.070
four nights,
which later i found out
was cocaine.

15:23.070 --> 15:26.290
and i left a note to tell 'em
where to find it.

15:26.290 --> 15:28.826
this was at the 27
you left the note?

15:28.826 --> 15:33.164
i couldn't-- i couldn't look
to see what happened after,
'cause i'm downstairs.

15:33.164 --> 15:36.050
but next day it was gone.

15:36.050 --> 15:39.637
then here come the drug dealer
looking for me,

15:39.637 --> 15:45.226
say he gonna kill me
either if i don't give him
his drugs or money, $37,000.

15:45.226 --> 15:48.229
say he knew it was me
'cause of the storage area.

15:48.229 --> 15:50.932
what was his name?
he didn't say.

15:50.932 --> 15:53.234
he's the guy that was in the car
with you and kwasi?
yeah.

15:53.234 --> 15:57.855
how'd kwasi get into it?
i had went to him,
'cause i was afraid.

15:57.855 --> 16:02.410
i was supposed to meet him
today at fourth and "b."

16:02.410 --> 16:05.162
wait a minute.
this is prince, the guy
who wanted his drugs back?

16:05.162 --> 16:07.832
or either he was
gonna kill me.

16:07.832 --> 16:12.003
i been afraid to tell him
that i had told the police,

16:12.003 --> 16:15.373
and i didn't know
what to do.

16:15.373 --> 16:17.708
and i called kwasi.
did he know prince?

16:17.708 --> 16:22.596
uh-uh. i just wanted kwasi
to tell what happened.

16:22.596 --> 16:26.934
and he did it for me.
the other guy met you?

16:26.934 --> 16:32.640
he got out of his car
at fourth and "b,"
got in kwasi's backseat.

16:32.640 --> 16:38.479
kwasi said that i called 911
to take the drugs away, and that
that was the right thing to do.

16:38.479 --> 16:42.616
and that if he harmed me
over it, kwasi would call
the police himself.

16:43.117 --> 16:44.986
then he said that
he had been fronted...

16:44.986 --> 16:48.622
for half those drugs,
and that who he owed
was after him.

16:48.622 --> 16:51.709
kwasi's saying,
"well, that's between y'all."

16:52.209 --> 16:54.211
then hell broke loose.

16:54.211 --> 16:57.214
a car drove up
doing weird stuff
with their doors--

16:57.214 --> 16:59.216
closing 'em,
opening 'em weird.

17:00.217 --> 17:03.220
then the shooting started.

17:03.220 --> 17:07.558
kwasi drove off,
but he just drove into
the front of the building.

17:07.558 --> 17:10.261
he must've
already been shot.

17:10.261 --> 17:15.766
then they came over
and shot the guy
in the backseat from close,

17:15.766 --> 17:19.103
then drove off.
but they didn't try
and shoot you.

17:19.103 --> 17:23.574
[ snorts ]
kwasi fell over me in the seat.

17:23.574 --> 17:25.409
i don't know
if they even saw me.

17:25.409 --> 17:28.829
seemed like they was
after the other one.

17:28.829 --> 17:32.033
- did you get any kind
  of look at them?
- not much.

17:32.033 --> 17:35.002
- jerome, what does that mean?
- i don't know how much
  a look i got.

17:35.002 --> 17:39.790
i got a look at 'em,
but i don't know how much
in terms of recognizing.

17:39.790 --> 17:44.428
i'm not trying to lie to you.
i'll help you if i can.

17:45.212 --> 17:47.548
you know someone
named fat cat?
no.

17:47.548 --> 17:49.934
but he said something
about him-- the prince.

17:50.368 --> 17:54.722
said his name about the drugs.
fat cat was who fronted him.

17:58.359 --> 18:01.562
could i get a soda?
yeah.

18:03.481 --> 18:05.483

we'll need him back...

with fat cat's button guys.

a can of soda.

18:23.551 --> 18:26.003

18:36.814 --> 18:40.901

i just wanted to ask you
a few questions.

18:44.155 --> 18:47.575
what did my brother say?
was he involved?

18:48.826 --> 18:51.579
[ door closes ]
it's all right.

18:51.579 --> 18:57.201
your brother turned in
some drugs to the police that
he had found in his building.

18:57.201 --> 19:00.204
when the dealer who had stashed
the drugs figured out it was
jerome who'd found them,

19:00.204 --> 19:02.423
he started
threatening jerome.

19:02.923 --> 19:04.925
then jerome asked kwasi
to talk to the dealer.

19:04.925 --> 19:07.678
kwasi-- he, uh, stood up
for your brother.

19:07.678 --> 19:11.182
he told the dealer to leave
jerome alone, and while
this all was happening...

19:11.182 --> 19:15.686
it looks like the people who
the dealer had gotten the drugs
from came and they shot 'em.

19:15.686 --> 19:20.107
- and they shot kwasi too.
- that's what it looks like.

19:20.107 --> 19:22.860
so my dad was being
a good person.

19:22.860 --> 19:26.113
that's right, hanna.

19:28.315 --> 19:30.701

want to get home now.

i want to know my husband's
killers are gonna be arrested.

19:35.706 --> 19:40.461
we got a good idea who to look
for, and we're gonna notify
you when anything happens.

19:40.461 --> 19:44.415
do you have someone
to be with you, margaret?

19:44.415 --> 19:48.719
i don't want you all
arranging my grieving any more
than my husband would.

this fat cat's places

not doing murders.

20:19.283 --> 20:23.254

that right after the murder,

you came running out,
right after the shots
were fired.

20:44.808 --> 20:48.145
well, if you want
to believe a cough-syrup junkie
and a juicehead--

20:48.145 --> 20:50.314
you're saying you weren't
in the bodega?

lonny says you were
doing some guys in there.

20:57.871 --> 21:00.874

lonny wouldn't know sex
from an uptown bus.

you don't make yourself
a witness, lisa, we're gonna
make you an accomplice.

21:03.460 --> 21:06.130
so stop bum-rapping lonny
and tell us what went on.

21:06.130 --> 21:09.500
i was in the bodega
to get a female product.

21:09.500 --> 21:12.836
two gentlemen asked
to ask me something
in the basement.

21:12.836 --> 21:18.475
so i go down there with one
after the other one, and the
other one yells, "it's him."

21:18.475 --> 21:22.896
- which was oswaldo mendoza.
- not oswaldo, the first
  gentleman in the basement.

21:22.896 --> 21:24.982
lisa, the guy you were
down there with that
went back upstairs--

21:25.482 --> 21:28.068
- i'm asking you:
  who was he talking about?
- not oswaldo.

21:28.068 --> 21:30.354
they were waiting
for someone to come in.

21:30.354 --> 21:32.656
the well-dressed guys
were waiting for the guy
who got murdered?

21:32.656 --> 21:36.327
that's what i would gather.
and what did oswaldo
have to do with it?

21:36.327 --> 21:38.327
oswaldo said i should
party with them.

21:38.327 --> 21:41.780
so now you're done
partying with the guy,
who already went back upstairs,

21:41.780 --> 21:44.283
and he shouts out,
"it's him."

21:44.283 --> 21:48.120
-what's the other guy
 you're still doing do?
-he's straightenin' himself out.

21:48.120 --> 21:52.341
then there is shots
and cryin' and moanin'.

21:52.341 --> 21:57.462

and i gather that they both
run out the alley door.

21:57.462 --> 22:00.516
- and where's oswaldo?
- oswaldo's gone.

22:00.516 --> 22:02.801

in your grocery's basement.

26:32.754 --> 26:35.173

that you don't know
what they were doing there?

26:35.674 --> 26:38.176
i got tightness in my chest
and the nitro
isn't relieving it.

26:38.176 --> 26:40.462
that's from not
telling the truth.
that shuts your system down.

26:40.462 --> 26:44.766
you're never gonna
hear this in a courtroom.

26:44.766 --> 26:48.603
- we're not in a courtroom.
- the guy who was shot
  was shaking me down.

26:48.603 --> 26:52.274
what happened was beyond
my control, but that's
what he was there for.

26:52.274 --> 26:54.559
my understanding,
they was gonna talk to him.
the other happened.

26:55.010 --> 26:57.946
- it was like a horse was on me,
  the middle of my chest.
- you hired these two guys?

26:57.946 --> 27:01.817
-i did not hire them.
- so who were they, oswaldo?
  concerned relatives?

27:01.817 --> 27:04.786
i pay a guy to look out
for me, all right?
i already pay somebody.

27:04.786 --> 27:07.739
and?
and those guys
work for him.

27:07.739 --> 27:09.991
you gotta find a way
to give 'em up, oswaldo.

27:09.991 --> 27:13.795
if you think i'm gonna get
between that-- i got enough
death looking me in the face.

27:13.795 --> 27:17.465
otherwise, you're our
chief suspect.
then prosecute me.

27:17.465 --> 27:21.303

 i don't want to be hindered.

jerome, i'm not telling you
how to answer here,

28:07.182 --> 28:10.101

that if you're not sure
picking one guy out,

28:10.101 --> 28:12.470
then the i.d.
don't help us none.

28:19.728 --> 28:23.315
i'm going with
number three.

recognize him from?

where my brother-in-law
got killed--

28:30.822 --> 28:33.325
is that right?

28:35.543 --> 28:40.465
don't worry. i wasn't doing
anything anyway. if you need me,
i'll be on the upstairs cot.

28:40.465 --> 28:43.218

on the second hitter.

28:43.218 --> 28:47.138

a phone tip. some drunk's
bragging on a bodega whack.

yeah, go ahead.

of e.s.u. for backup?

three hours.

28:57.649 --> 29:00.602

here on overtime.

which hitter
you want to flip?
who do you think's dumber?

29:04.189 --> 29:06.074
got a nice dopey
vibe off that hollis.

29:06.074 --> 29:11.279
if we keep trenton, too,
maybe we can make him think
hollis gave him up.

29:11.279 --> 29:14.082
won't that make
trent dumber?

29:16.368 --> 29:19.454
-thanks, harold.
- want him uncuffed?

29:19.454 --> 29:21.873

- you understand
  what i'm sayin'?
- yeah.

29:46.231 --> 29:48.650
well, then you're
one up on your buddy
in there,

that's gotta set
his mind straight.

29:50.452 --> 29:52.821
okay?
i can walk you both out
off an illegal search,

29:52.821 --> 29:55.790

he don't even work
for fat cat.

29:56.291 --> 29:59.794
- do what you gotta do, chief.
- i can't, because your asshole
  buddy isn't letting me.

i'm telling you,
the d.a. don't hear you
vouch for this other guy,

then my hustle is gone,
and i'll blow your head off.

i don't know what
you're telling me.

30:09.804 --> 30:12.891
you vouch trent works
for fat cat. the d.a. is
watching through the mirror.

with illegal search.
vouch how?

you vouch he works for fat cat.
i lead you out.

"he's the one who was with me."

do i care how you vouch?

you vouch,
and you get out.

give you up, trent,
or am i taking that wrong?

30:54.632 --> 30:56.468

want to do about that,

thinking about being a husband
to some guy named joe?

about that note, jerome,

where you told the police
about the drugs.

33:37.378 --> 33:39.881
i wrote it and i
left it at the desk.

33:39.881 --> 33:44.052
you wrote it
and left it on the desk
at the 27 station house?

two blocks up and one over
from my building.
i don't know the number.

- was the sergeant at the desk?
- nobody was at the desk.

there's always somebody
at the desk!

you're talking about, jerome.

33:56.781 --> 34:00.952
it's a little desk
just when you walk in.

34:00.952 --> 34:03.988
- got flyers on it.
- community relations desk.

34:05.990 --> 34:08.793
what if i told you, jerome,

34:08.793 --> 34:12.163
that we heard that you and kwasi
were both in on this drug deal?

34:12.163 --> 34:15.416
- that's not true.
- nobody's looking to
  hurt you here, jerome.

34:15.416 --> 34:18.553
there's no evidence that
we can use. but if you
were involved in this,

34:18.553 --> 34:20.755
we gotta know about it
for what we take to the d.a.

34:20.755 --> 34:24.342
-it's not true.
-maybe kwasi was involved
  and you just took the ride?

what it was about?
he wasn't.

in the basement.

bringing him in.

36:49.787 --> 36:53.574
why did you accuse my brother
of being involved again?

we were verifying that he
wasn't involved. sometimes
you take interview techniques,

you make it seem that you
think something that you don't.

out of the question.

she believed that
her dad was a hero,

got into it,

to me man-to-man
and left it there.

- can we go?
-i'd also say to hanna...

could understand that.

39:18.135 --> 39:21.388
we're gonna have to kick
this guy who could've
given up his accomplice.

39:21.388 --> 39:24.024
two murderers your client
can get off the streets. we're
gonna have to turn 'em loose.

39:24.024 --> 39:27.027
don't pretend your client
oswaldo wasn't working drug
deals out of that bodega,

39:27.027 --> 39:29.980
mr. moscoso,
not with that grocery selection.

39:29.980 --> 39:33.534
as long as you're running
errands, you tell oswaldo
he's a lying, gutless scumbag.

39:33.534 --> 39:36.620
it's easy to have opinions not
having to live and do business
in the neighborhood.

39:36.620 --> 39:38.989
my opinions don't depend
where i live.

39:38.989 --> 39:41.742
tell him he's a scumbag,
and he gets the neighborhood
he deserves.

39:41.742 --> 39:43.577
good day.
good day.

39:43.577 --> 39:46.497
hey, how's it going?
good.
how's yourself?

39:46.497 --> 39:48.499
all right.

39:48.999 --> 39:51.635
i guess we gotta
go kick this guy.

39:51.635 --> 39:53.888
[ hand thuds ]

40:01.262 --> 40:05.266
did you hear her
tell that little girl
to hate me?

40:05.766 --> 40:07.768
yeah.

40:13.274 --> 40:15.776
come back from vietnam,

40:15.776 --> 40:18.779
i go right on the job.

40:18.779 --> 40:22.283
job don't send me
to the academy or nothing.

40:22.283 --> 40:26.787
puts me undercover right away,
'cause-- cause i'm who
they're looking for.

40:26.787 --> 40:30.291
just out of the service,
working-class guy--

40:30.291 --> 40:35.296
all the credentials for being
some disillusioned asshole who
wants to piss on everything...

40:35.296 --> 40:39.800
i just spent
two and a half years
getting shot at about.

40:39.800 --> 40:43.804
i don't even get
to be with cops
when i'm debriefed.

40:43.804 --> 40:46.523
some guy in the bottom
of the post office building...

40:46.523 --> 40:49.526
takes my information
and tells me what to do.

40:50.027 --> 40:53.314
jerk in a suit--
he don't even tell me his name.

40:53.314 --> 40:55.733
he has me join
the young patriots.

40:55.733 --> 40:59.987
it's-- it's like
the women's auxiliary
for the black panthers.

40:59.987 --> 41:05.459
i get to bring
the panthers coffee
and lead cheers.

41:05.459 --> 41:08.963
"right on," you know.
"oh, you said a mouthful,
 brother."

41:08.963 --> 41:11.915
"let's definitely take
 that bank off."

41:13.917 --> 41:16.420
then i go work my cover job
unloading furniture.

41:16.920 --> 41:21.925
and then i go home and i drink
myself stupid so as not to run
my head into the wall,

41:21.925 --> 41:23.677
thinking how much i hate
what i'm doing.

41:23.677 --> 41:28.065
i sat in rice paddies the night
so dark you didn't know
which way was up,

41:28.565 --> 41:32.653
wanting to scream and shoot
your gun off for light and you'd
know where the hell you were,

41:32.653 --> 41:37.441
so i could come home and do
chores and hear my country get
pissed on by a bunch of spades!

41:37.441 --> 41:41.328
hey, andy!
don't start talking like that,
all right?

41:43.614 --> 41:45.866
i'm trying to explain
something to you.

41:45.866 --> 41:49.036
and i'm telling you
that when you use
that kind of language,

41:49.036 --> 41:52.256
i can't get to
what you're saying.

41:52.256 --> 41:54.758
you don't have
to call 'em spades
to tell what happened.

41:54.758 --> 41:58.345
- spades is how i feel.
- you call that
  little girl a spade?

41:58.345 --> 42:00.014
she's not who
i was talking about.

42:00.014 --> 42:03.350
well, that's who i see
when you're talking.
you follow my problem?

42:03.350 --> 42:06.470
hey, forget about it.
you have a nice night.

42:06.470 --> 42:09.356
i was trying to explain
something to you.
excuse me for--

42:09.356 --> 42:12.142
for trying to talk
to my partner.

42:12.142 --> 42:13.894
[ scoffs ]

42:15.779 --> 42:19.233
go ahead, partner.

42:19.233 --> 42:22.736
[ sniffs ]
it was hard for me.
you understand that, huh?

42:22.736 --> 42:26.740
come back to the world--
least i-- i thought i could
talk to somebody,

42:26.740 --> 42:30.461
and maybe somebody, uh,
respects what i did.

42:30.461 --> 42:32.629
i dreamt of being a cop.

42:32.629 --> 42:36.633
now a cop sees me
on the street he spits--
he spits on the ground.

42:36.633 --> 42:40.137
and i know he's supposed to,
'cause i'm kissing
bastards' asses...

42:40.137 --> 42:44.007
want to blow up the bank
that my mother pays
her house loans at.

42:44.007 --> 42:48.011
and i'm telling these bastards
how brave and great
i think they are.

42:48.011 --> 42:51.231
how i loved it when my dad--
he-he finally saved enough...

42:51.732 --> 42:54.234
after he's in the service
to move us from the quonsets.

42:54.735 --> 42:57.488
and we're finally
in a decent neighborhood
until they move in.

42:57.488 --> 43:01.692
i gotta fight to keep
my lunch money, and the project
turns into a sty.

43:01.692 --> 43:04.695
and he gets his eye put out
by one of 'em drunk
with a hammer...

43:04.695 --> 43:07.915
who don't want
his gas meter read.

43:10.084 --> 43:14.922
to have her tell
that little girl to hate me--

43:16.423 --> 43:18.425
i try to do my job.

43:18.425 --> 43:22.429
put your own feelings aside
unless they show you
they're wrong.

43:22.429 --> 43:26.216
and that sweet little girl
is told to hate me.

43:26.216 --> 43:31.305
but what is she supposed to do,
andy? she supposed to feel
sorry for you?

43:31.805 --> 43:34.308
she's supposed to think
it's okay you call
her father a nigger...

43:34.308 --> 43:36.560
because you had
bad times growing up?

43:36.560 --> 43:40.647
i had bad times from them people
my whole life.

43:41.648 --> 43:43.650
hey, my dad got his ass kicked
at shape-ups...

43:44.151 --> 43:46.987
by white longshoremen
for being dark-skinned.

43:47.488 --> 43:51.959
i don't hate them people,
and i don't hate you.

43:51.959 --> 43:56.914
but i'm supposed to care
what happened to her people
300 years ago.

43:58.916 --> 44:00.717
there you go.

44:03.086 --> 44:05.088
at least she shook my hand.

44:06.089 --> 44:07.925
yeah.

44:09.393 --> 44:11.895
i don't think
she hated me that much.
