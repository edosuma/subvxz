Well, thank you cousin.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.156
Oh, well, the door's locked.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.858
Listen, I appreciate everything

12:37.891 --> 12:40.160
you try to do for me,
but I'm out of luck.

12:40.193 --> 12:43.830
Now, Balki, don't you know
the mailman's oath?

12:43.864 --> 12:46.132
"Neither rain nor sleet,
nor locked door

12:46.166 --> 12:48.802
shall stay these couriers
from the swift execution

12:48.835 --> 12:50.036
of their appointed rounds."

12:52.973 --> 12:54.908
"Locked doors" isn't in there.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.912
Yes, it is.
It's in the second verse.

13:01.948 --> 13:04.017
Now, listen to me,
this is just a hunk.

13:04.050 --> 13:06.286
But you know what I think?

13:06.319 --> 13:09.355
I think you want to get in there
and get your article

13:09.389 --> 13:11.357
and you don't care
anything about the mail.

13:11.391 --> 13:14.060
Oh, oh, oh.
Balki, you're right.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.898
I am in deep trouble.

13:17.931 --> 13:20.500
I need your help.
Please.

13:20.534 --> 13:22.135
If I don't get
that article back

13:22.168 --> 13:24.404
I'm going to lose my job.

13:24.437 --> 13:25.572
But you'll help me now,
won't you?

13:25.606 --> 13:27.608
‐ Well, cousin, cousin, cousin.
‐ Won't you?

13:27.641 --> 13:30.243
‐ Cousin‐‐
‐ Please, please.

13:30.276 --> 13:32.178
Stop it.

13:32.212 --> 13:33.346
Alright, I'll help you.

13:33.379 --> 13:34.214
‐ Thank you.
‐ It's okay.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.049
‐ Thank you. Thank you.
‐ It's all fine.

13:36.082 --> 13:38.184
‐ Would you stop it?
‐ Sorry.

13:38.218 --> 13:39.620
Alright, now,
the door is locked.

13:39.653 --> 13:41.855
How we going to get in?

13:41.888 --> 13:42.889
We'll do what they did
on "Moonlighting."

13:42.923 --> 13:44.057
I don't know what
they did on "Moonlighting."

13:44.090 --> 13:45.091
‐ I do.
‐ You do?

13:45.125 --> 13:46.326
‐ I do.
‐ You do?

13:46.359 --> 13:48.294
‐ Will you stop it?
‐ Okay.

13:53.199 --> 13:55.135
Credit card.

14:08.114 --> 14:10.250
Maybe you're over
your credit limit.

14:11.417 --> 14:12.418
Oh, great.

14:12.452 --> 14:15.021
The part with my name
on it is still in the door.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.593
Okay, cousin. Maybe
we should just go home now.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.361
Wait.

14:21.394 --> 14:22.996
The transom.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.398
Balki, give me a boost.

14:25.431 --> 14:27.868
Alright.
You're a snappy dresser.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.311
Not that kind of boost.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.382
But thank you.

14:43.950 --> 14:45.519
Now lift me up here.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.387
‐ Alright, ready?
‐ Yeah.

14:47.420 --> 14:50.223
Oh, one, two, three.

14:50.256 --> 14:51.424
Okay, good, good.

14:51.457 --> 14:52.926
I've got it. Alright.

14:52.959 --> 14:54.060
‐ I'm stepping on your shoulder.
‐ Oh, yeah.

14:54.094 --> 14:55.228
I'm stepping on your shoulder.

14:55.261 --> 14:56.396
Tell me if I'm hurting you.

14:56.429 --> 14:58.398
[groaning]

15:02.435 --> 15:04.270
Give me, uh,
give me a little push.

15:04.304 --> 15:06.239
Give me a little push.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.345
Can you reach the knob?

15:12.378 --> 15:14.915
I‐I'm trying.
I'm trying.

15:19.285 --> 15:21.221
Almost got it.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.496
‐ How about now?
‐ I got it.

15:32.999 --> 15:34.935
[panting]

15:44.010 --> 15:47.514
Let's just get the article
and get out of here.

15:47.548 --> 15:48.649
Here it is.

15:48.682 --> 15:50.183
Alright.

15:50.216 --> 15:52.318
Here's the real article.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.324
[elevator bell dings]

16:00.226 --> 16:02.195
The security guard.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.600
Under the desk.

16:06.633 --> 16:09.369
[dramatic music]

16:43.604 --> 16:46.472
Cousin, I‐I can't help noticing

16:46.507 --> 16:48.441
that things aren't going well.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.279
‐ What are we going to do?
‐ Temporary setback.

16:56.249 --> 16:58.519
We'll just wait
for the security guard to leave

16:58.552 --> 17:01.021
and then we'll go back
in through the window.

17:15.569 --> 17:17.738
That sounded like the guard

17:17.771 --> 17:20.040
locked the window.

17:21.207 --> 17:24.077
Balki, tell me the guard
didn't lock the window.

17:25.111 --> 17:28.147
The guard didn't
lock the window.

17:28.849 --> 17:30.216
Thank God.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.117
Alright, let's go back in.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.418
We might have
a little problem with that.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.419
Why?

17:33.453 --> 17:34.688
Because the guard

17:34.721 --> 17:36.623
locked the window.

17:38.725 --> 17:42.162
Balki, you told me that the
guard didn't lock the window.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.797
But that is because
you told me to tell you

17:43.830 --> 17:47.200
that the guard
didn't lock the window.

17:49.603 --> 17:50.637
Well, why don't we go see

17:50.671 --> 17:52.873
if indeed the guard

17:52.906 --> 17:55.776
locked... the window.

18:13.894 --> 18:16.196
The window is locked.

18:17.631 --> 18:19.566
Perhaps the guard locked it.

18:26.507 --> 18:27.641
Perhaps.

18:31.512 --> 18:33.179
[siren wailing]

18:33.213 --> 18:36.449
Cousin, Look. Look.
The police. We're saved.

18:36.482 --> 18:39.319
[Larry]
Oh, my Lord.
What are they doing here?

18:39.352 --> 18:40.854
Maybe there's
a donut shop down there.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.593
And look, look.
A fire truck, too.

18:46.627 --> 18:48.394
Hey! Hello!

18:48.428 --> 18:49.830
Hello! Hello!

18:49.863 --> 18:52.666
Get back.
They'll see us.

18:52.699 --> 18:55.669
‐ Question.
‐ Hmm? Sorry.

18:55.702 --> 18:58.404
If they can't see us,
how they going to save us?

18:58.438 --> 18:59.806
Balki, if they see us

18:59.840 --> 19:01.675
they'll know we were
trying to break in.

19:01.708 --> 19:04.344
And then
we'll be in big trouble.

19:05.546 --> 19:07.781
Then we'll be in big trouble?

19:09.916 --> 19:13.219
Cousin, we're up to our armpits
in sheep dip right now!

19:18.859 --> 19:21.461
Get that spotlight
off me or I'll jump!

19:29.335 --> 19:30.571
Frank?

19:30.604 --> 19:31.705
Stay away!

19:31.738 --> 19:33.540
You can't talk me out of this!

19:33.574 --> 19:35.475
Frank, what you doing up here?

19:35.509 --> 19:38.512
I don't know.
I'm confused.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.313
I just came out here to think.

19:40.346 --> 19:43.249
Well, you picked
a dangerous place to think.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.952
Balki, he came up here
to think about suicide.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.922
Oh, cousin.

19:48.955 --> 19:51.592
Frank, I‐I know you're
under a lot of pressure

19:51.625 --> 19:53.627
but it can't be that bad.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.629
What do you know about it?

19:55.662 --> 19:57.564
Life stinks!

19:57.598 --> 19:59.232
I see it every day.

19:59.265 --> 20:01.367
Assaults, murders.

20:01.902 --> 20:03.604
Look, robberies.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.908
Nobody cares about anybody.

20:13.647 --> 20:14.648
Mr. Peterson.

20:16.617 --> 20:17.518
What are you guys
doing out here?

20:17.551 --> 20:19.620
Well, it's a long story.
Cousin Larry, said‐‐

20:19.653 --> 20:20.621
What are we doing out here?

20:20.654 --> 20:22.556
Isn't it obvious,
what we're doing out here?

20:22.589 --> 20:25.892
We came out here to get
our friend off the ledge.

20:25.926 --> 20:28.394
Oh, boy.
You never let up.

20:30.330 --> 20:33.299
Not when it comes
to the life of a friend.

20:33.333 --> 20:36.369
Frank, don't do this.

20:36.402 --> 20:37.604
Leave me alone.

20:37.638 --> 20:38.939
Well, we've done all we can do.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.510
Leave this in the hands
of the professionals.

20:43.544 --> 20:45.411
Now, cousin, cousin.

20:45.445 --> 20:46.913
We've got to stop
thinking about ourselves

20:46.947 --> 20:49.315
and maybe think about Frank.

20:49.349 --> 20:51.051
Maybe he'll talk to us.

20:51.084 --> 20:52.953
Balki, these people
have experience

20:52.986 --> 20:54.621
with this sort of thing.

20:54.655 --> 20:56.056
Get away from that window!

20:56.089 --> 20:57.624
He don't won't to talk to them.

20:57.658 --> 20:59.526
Well, I don't know
what to say to him.

20:59.560 --> 21:03.029
Well, I...
Maybe I think of something.

21:03.063 --> 21:05.298
Alright. Go ahead.

21:05.331 --> 21:07.868
But be careful.

21:07.901 --> 21:10.604
One wrong word
and this man's gonna jump.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.573
Alright.
I'll be careful.

21:19.045 --> 21:20.480
Frank.

21:23.116 --> 21:25.285
Having a bad day?

21:28.989 --> 21:30.991
[instrumental music]

21:33.994 --> 21:36.062
Oh, this is Frank Jr.

21:36.096 --> 21:38.532
He's moving up from T‐Ball
to little league this year.

21:38.565 --> 21:40.033
Oh, the kid's a natural.

21:40.066 --> 21:42.836
Oh, I was a caesarean myself.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.843
You know, Frank, this,
this doesn't make any sense.

21:49.876 --> 21:52.112
You have a‐a wonderful family.

21:52.145 --> 21:54.681
You're one of the most respected
journalist in the city.

21:54.715 --> 21:56.850
Why would you even think
of jumping of a building?

21:56.883 --> 21:58.752
Because I'm sick of it.

21:58.785 --> 22:00.987
I've been covering crime
for 12 years.

22:01.021 --> 22:02.656
All I see all day are people

22:02.689 --> 22:04.057
doing terrible things
to each other.

22:04.090 --> 22:06.927
I can't take it anymore!

22:06.960 --> 22:08.995
But, Frank...

22:09.029 --> 22:10.864
...if you, jump you'll be doing

22:10.897 --> 22:13.433
something terrible
to your family.

22:13.466 --> 22:16.970
Why don't you just go home
and hug your wife and children

22:17.003 --> 22:18.972
and be glad that you're not one

22:19.005 --> 22:21.107
of the terrible people
that you write about.

22:23.409 --> 22:26.146
This is all so humiliating.

22:26.179 --> 22:27.848
Thanks for staying
out here with me.

22:31.051 --> 22:34.387
You know, Frank,
maybe you should get some help.

22:35.055 --> 22:36.489
Cousin Larry's right.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.625
You know, if‐if you
come out on this ledge again

22:38.659 --> 22:41.061
there's a very good chance
we won't be here.

22:47.801 --> 22:50.637
Frank, what do you say we go in?

22:50.671 --> 22:53.039
In a minute.

22:53.073 --> 22:54.474
This is the first
peaceful morning

I've had in 12 years.

23:08.622 --> 23:10.991
Whoa.
What a night.

23:11.024 --> 23:13.960
I never, never want
to go through that again.

23:13.994 --> 23:15.996
Uh, I've learned my lesson.

23:16.029 --> 23:19.600
All I want is a warm bed,
a soft pillow

23:19.633 --> 23:22.636
and to put this night behind me.

23:22.669 --> 23:24.905
‐ Goodnight, Balki.
‐ Goodnight, cousin.

[alarm clocks ringing]
