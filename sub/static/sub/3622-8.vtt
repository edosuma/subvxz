00:08.576 --> 00:11.210
These salesmen can smell
first-time buyers

00:11.212 --> 00:13.512

Yeah. How 'bout

Uh, uh, yeah, sure.

What are you planning
to use the machine for?

of an ice storm,

00:53.154 --> 00:54.319
Is it the blue skin?

00:54.321 --> 00:55.921
Because I get that a lot.

00:55.923 --> 00:58.190
Hey, our weather machines
are perfectly legal.

How you use them...

00:59.293 --> 01:02.928
that's your business, eh? Eh?

01:02.930 --> 01:03.929
Try one.

01:03.931 --> 01:07.733
I can see you're a
discerning customer.

01:07.735 --> 01:10.836
Nothing says "doomsday machine"
like the 3000 LXS.

01:10.838 --> 01:13.806
Hurricane-grade winds,
water-vapor compressor.

01:13.808 --> 01:16.241
It makes the perfect storm
even better.

01:16.243 --> 01:17.109
Heated seats?

01:17.111 --> 01:17.810
Standard.

01:17.812 --> 01:18.911
We'll take it.

01:18.913 --> 01:19.945
Great! Hey, why don't we

01:19.947 --> 01:21.313
step into the office to discuss

01:21.315 --> 01:22.581

03:14.361 --> 03:16.295
Ron, it's a great opportunity.

A mentor can be
a huge inspiration.

I don't know, KP.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.200
It seems to me... Whoa!

A jelly doughnut stuffer!

03:22.836 --> 03:23.936
Teach me, dude!

03:23.938 --> 03:25.103
Listen up, people.

03:25.105 --> 03:26.705
It's time to pair up

03:26.707 --> 03:28.340
with one of the volunteer

03:28.342 --> 03:29.942
Choose carefully.

Your entire future could well
hinge on this decision.

You have two minutes.

someone to trade mentors.

Hey, don't look at me, lady.

Oh, Kim, now that
you're a janitor,

could you do something
about the mirrors

believe in mentors.

17:52.005 --> 17:53.337
How do you know about all this?

17:53.339 --> 17:54.939
You're a janitor.

17:54.941 --> 17:55.907
That's was my cover.

17:55.909 --> 17:56.874
Good janitor disguise.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.209
What disguise?

17:58.211 --> 17:59.610
This is the uniform

17:59.612 --> 18:01.879
of a top secret
Canadian spy organization.

18:01.881 --> 18:03.047
You're a spy?!

18:03.049 --> 18:05.183
A Canadian spy, eh.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.884
Why didn't you just tell me?

18:06.886 --> 18:08.719
I thought I was
painfully obvious.

18:08.721 --> 18:11.589
Oh. Just like my messages
to young Stoppable.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.124
<i>You're</i> my mentor?!

18:14.827 --> 18:15.726
Kim Possible?!

18:15.728 --> 18:17.295
Again?!

18:17.297 --> 18:18.663
Shego, more lightning.

18:20.365 --> 18:22.633
As the world's
foremost Drakken expert,

18:22.635 --> 18:24.035
you were a natural
for this mission.

18:24.037 --> 18:26.304
But I don't know anything
about weather machines.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.139
That's why I was
sent to train you.

18:28.141 --> 18:29.707
( <i>squeals</i>)
Oh... my bad.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.645
Controls are shot.
Get up to the vacrometer,

18:34.647 --> 18:37.181
and implement
dismantling sequence.

18:37.183 --> 18:39.750
Uh... could you go over it
a few more times?

18:39.752 --> 18:40.852
No time. Go!

18:40.854 --> 18:42.019
Right behind you, KP.

18:42.021 --> 18:43.921
( <i>beeps</i> )

18:43.923 --> 18:46.624
( <i>Ron whoops and laughs</i> )

18:52.197 --> 18:53.364
Come on, come on.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.333
There's got to be
a way to stop these.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.036
( <i>geese honking</i> )

18:59.038 --> 19:00.071
( <i>gasps and yells</i> )

19:00.073 --> 19:01.072
( <i>honking</i> )

19:01.074 --> 19:02.840
( <i>yells</i> )

19:02.842 --> 19:06.277
( <i>honking</i> )

19:08.947 --> 19:10.948
Okay, Kim, think.

19:10.950 --> 19:12.984
There was definitely something
about a flange.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.052
What was it about?

19:16.421 --> 19:17.421
Aw...

19:17.423 --> 19:19.690
Today's forecast...

19:19.692 --> 19:20.791
100% chance

19:20.793 --> 19:21.792
of pain.

19:21.794 --> 19:23.127
Yah!

19:23.129 --> 19:24.996
Hya!

19:24.998 --> 19:26.764
( <i>grunting</i> )

19:32.404 --> 19:33.838
Come on, come on.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.239
( <i>grunts</i> )

19:35.241 --> 19:37.175
What are you doing?

19:39.978 --> 19:41.345
( <i>beeps</i> )

19:43.982 --> 19:46.217
( <i>yelling</i> )

19:53.825 --> 19:55.826
What's wrong, Kimmy?

19:55.828 --> 19:58.029
Feeling under the weather?

19:58.031 --> 19:59.263
( <i>Ron yells</i> )

20:00.365 --> 20:01.966
Falling pressure, Shego?

20:01.968 --> 20:03.434
Go, KP!

20:05.737 --> 20:08.339
Start with the output valve.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.007
Okay, not exactly that.

20:10.009 --> 20:12.310
Ooh, ooh! Try twisting
this knobby thing.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.911
Whoa!

20:13.913 --> 20:16.380
( <i>whooshing</i> )

20:17.049 --> 20:19.350
( <i>groaning</i> )

20:21.920 --> 20:24.789
We definitely ruled out
twisting <i>that</i> knobby thing.

20:24.791 --> 20:25.856
Thank you, Ron.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.225
No problem.

20:27.227 --> 20:28.726
Oh, why didn't I pay
more attention?

20:28.728 --> 20:30.027
Got to think.

20:30.029 --> 20:32.129
The main output valve
is connected to the...

20:32.131 --> 20:33.731
the filter compression tank.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.901
With the bypass located
in the gear-shifting transmuter.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.269
Okay, so that means...

20:38.271 --> 20:40.371
You're too late, Kim Possible.

20:40.373 --> 20:43.074
Any second, this storm
will be complete

20:43.076 --> 20:44.141
and unstoppable.

20:44.143 --> 20:46.043
Actually, it's Stoppable.

20:46.045 --> 20:47.111
Ron Stoppable.

20:47.113 --> 20:47.912
I don't get it.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.981
( <i>inhales</i>)

20:49.983 --> 20:52.984
( <i>sneezes</i> )

20:52.986 --> 20:55.286
( <i>sneezes</i>)

20:55.288 --> 20:56.387
Ooh, yeah!

20:56.389 --> 20:58.356
Nice work, Agent Stoppable.

20:58.358 --> 20:59.991
Now, I'm pretty sure

20:59.993 --> 21:04.095
that shutdown has to begin
with the hydro-reflux valve.

21:05.897 --> 21:07.465
Yes!

21:10.435 --> 21:12.470
The water's going back
to the lake.

21:12.472 --> 21:13.971
Kim, you did it.

21:13.973 --> 21:16.007
With seconds to spare.

21:16.009 --> 21:17.775
Joe would be proud.

21:20.412 --> 21:22.146
( <i>moaning</i>)

21:22.148 --> 21:24.148
( <i>rumbling</i> )

21:27.052 --> 21:30.121
SHEGO: So, <i>that's</i> what
happened to the fish.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.223
KIM:
<i>So, you're all packed?</i>

21:32.225 --> 21:33.958
Yes, it's time
to return to Canada.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.227
Well, thanks for...
you know, training me.

21:36.229 --> 21:38.362
Wish I had been
a better student.

21:38.364 --> 21:40.364
When it came down to it,
you had the right stuff.

21:40.366 --> 21:41.399
Even him.

21:41.401 --> 21:43.367
Joe, you just can't go.

21:43.369 --> 21:44.902
But I must, young Stoppable.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.103
Duty calls.

21:46.105 --> 21:47.405
That's what I'm talking about.

21:47.407 --> 21:49.573
The boys' room by the
cafeteria is a disaster.

21:49.575 --> 21:53.010
Stoppable,
I'm not <i>really</i> a janitor.

21:53.012 --> 21:54.478
Ms. Possible,
farewell.

21:54.480 --> 21:55.880
Yeah, later.

21:55.882 --> 21:57.882
I actually think I'm
going to miss him.

21:57.884 --> 21:59.083
Me, too.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.217
( <i>door opens</i>) Joe?

22:00.219 --> 22:02.386
I am Ludwig.

22:02.388 --> 22:04.121
You must be the new janitor.

22:04.123 --> 22:05.523
Welcome to Middleton High.

22:05.525 --> 22:06.557
I'm Kim Possible.

22:06.559 --> 22:08.225
Ach! Miss Possible,

22:08.227 --> 22:11.228
it is excellent
that I have found you fast.

22:11.230 --> 22:14.932
I am a Bavarian spy
on a top secret mission.

22:14.934 --> 22:16.867
Really? Great!

22:16.869 --> 22:18.569
Here we go.
