00:45.400 --> 00:48.300
Allah, in his wisdom and greatness,

00:48.400 --> 00:50.000
has given us each a gift.

00:50.400 --> 00:53.200
A gift that we must share with others.

00:53.500 --> 00:56.300
Even if they do not wish to accept it.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.665
It is our obligation

00:58.700 --> 01:01.300
to share Islam with non-believers.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.700
So that we may save them

01:04.500 --> 01:05.900
from themselves.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
My husband. You were anxious
to talk to him, weren't you?

02:57.200 --> 02:58.165
That's a movie.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.665
I'm starting to get over the idea...

02:59.700 --> 03:01.600
Not just any movie.
That's "Double Identity".

03:03.100 --> 03:06.100
Your power of observation is
unearthly. Now, leave me alone.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.600
This is the best part.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.900
I not gonna get between
a chick and a flick.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.300
How do you know it's the best part?

03:13.400 --> 03:15.400
Because it is the third
time I have seen it.

03:15.500 --> 03:16.800
You don't even watch movies.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.400
This is not a movie.

03:18.600 --> 03:19.900
It's a classic film.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.400
Yeah, I know that. You don't know that.

03:24.600 --> 03:25.700
Film studies?

03:26.300 --> 03:27.300
Well...

03:27.600 --> 03:30.065
I really appreciate
that, Ziva. Really, I do.

03:30.100 --> 03:33.200
I am taking it because it is the best
way to pick up American colloquialism,

03:33.235 --> 03:34.300
like "bug off."

03:34.500 --> 03:36.500
You should watch "Fast
Times at Ridgemont High".

03:36.535 --> 03:38.700
I saw it last week.
Sean Penn is a genius.

03:38.735 --> 03:40.100
Phoebe Cates is a babe.

03:40.400 --> 03:41.400
Now,

03:41.800 --> 03:42.900
do you mind?

03:43.100 --> 03:44.900
- I can get you a list...
- I have a list!

03:45.700 --> 03:46.700
Bye.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.200
Morning, Probie Pan.

03:50.500 --> 03:52.000
Where'd you pick that up? Neverland?

03:52.200 --> 03:53.600
No, Pottery Den.

03:53.900 --> 03:56.300
50% off. Got six of
them for ten dollars.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.865
That's pretty big, don't you think?

03:57.900 --> 04:00.100
Well, I don't like getting
refills ten times a day.

04:00.135 --> 04:02.100
Well, but I mean, that's a little...

04:03.500 --> 04:04.500
A little what?

04:08.100 --> 04:09.100
Seuss-ical?

04:09.300 --> 04:11.000
Leave. I'm enjoying my moment.

04:13.700 --> 04:15.100
Am I the only normal one here?

04:15.200 --> 04:16.000
No.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.200
Morning, Boss.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.000
Marine killed. Let's go.

04:20.399 --> 04:21.399
Shotgun.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.500
Anacostia and 18th,

04:26.500 --> 04:28.300
not the battlefield
he thought he'd die on.

04:30.300 --> 04:32.300
Baghdad's safer than this neighborhood.

04:32.600 --> 04:33.600
Hey.

04:34.300 --> 04:35.300
What do we got?

04:37.600 --> 04:39.400
Ring, watch, and wallet are missing.

04:41.300 --> 04:42.400
Government issue.

04:43.500 --> 04:44.900
Could be the murder weapon.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.800
A Marine killed with his own gun?

04:46.900 --> 04:48.500
Nearly 30% of all

04:48.800 --> 04:50.365
gun-related deaths

04:50.400 --> 04:52.900
are the results of
the owner's own weapon.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.165
Your first impressions, Mr. Palmer?

04:55.200 --> 04:57.700
Well, there should be much
more blood loss evident.

04:57.800 --> 04:58.865
Based upon?

04:58.900 --> 05:01.100
Based on the position of the body,

05:01.400 --> 05:03.100
even with the heart slightly elevated.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.400
Precisely even

05:04.500 --> 05:06.400
with a gunshot that high in the thoracic

05:06.435 --> 05:08.100
cavity, one would expect more

05:08.400 --> 05:09.800
- blood loss.
- Meaning?

05:09.900 --> 05:11.850
Meaning I'm not going
to say anything else

05:11.885 --> 05:13.800
until I've examined
the body more closely.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.400
The gurney, please, Mr. Palmer.

05:15.500 --> 05:16.600
Right away, Doctor.

05:16.800 --> 05:17.900
Good lad.

05:18.300 --> 05:19.300
Good Marine.

05:20.500 --> 05:21.500
Sunni.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.300
- How do you know that?
- If he were a Shiite,

05:24.900 --> 05:26.600
he'd have a turba with him.

05:26.635 --> 05:28.300
Like Hadji on "Johnny Quest".

05:28.500 --> 05:30.600
No, I believe that's a turban, Tony.

05:30.635 --> 05:33.165
A turba is a small stone tablet

05:33.200 --> 05:36.700
that the Shiites set their
forehead on while praying.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.400
The devout develop a callus.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.600
Ziva.

05:41.100 --> 05:42.900
Checking for local Sunni mosques.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.200
McGee.

05:45.700 --> 05:47.300
Checking all security cameras. Got it.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.200
There's a Sunni mosque two blocks east.

05:50.235 --> 05:51.235
Show me.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.200
She cannot come in here.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.200
Women are not allowed.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.200
I will wait outside.

06:04.800 --> 06:05.800
Federal agents.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.200
She's with me.

06:10.900 --> 06:12.800
She is welcome here. As you are.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.000
I'm sure you understand traditions.

06:15.300 --> 06:16.900
We do not wish to offend anyone.

06:17.600 --> 06:18.600
I am Jewish.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.300
I do understand tradition.

06:23.400 --> 06:25.300
You... wish to ask me questions?

06:25.400 --> 06:26.400
No.

06:26.600 --> 06:30.800
Then, you wish to speak to every man
who worships here under the age of 30.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.000
No.

06:32.200 --> 06:33.200
Then what?

06:33.300 --> 06:36.000
We think this man may
have attended your mosque.

06:36.300 --> 06:37.400
And what has he done?

06:37.800 --> 06:39.500
Nothing. He is dead,

06:40.300 --> 06:41.800
killed two blocks from here.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.100
Do you know him?

06:48.500 --> 06:50.000
Stahf'Allah.

06:51.500 --> 06:52.500
This is my son.

07:03.559 --> 07:04.859
Your son have any enemies?

07:05.159 --> 07:07.959
Yes. Ignorance, intolerance, and hatred.

07:09.159 --> 07:10.259
Any with a first name?

07:12.459 --> 07:14.759
We would like your permission
to look at Abdul's things.

07:14.859 --> 07:16.959
I'll need to tell the
family what has happened.

07:17.159 --> 07:18.559
We will have someone drive you.

07:18.659 --> 07:19.759
Thank you.

07:20.359 --> 07:21.459
You wait here.

07:21.659 --> 07:22.659
Please.

07:30.259 --> 07:31.359
Come on.

07:31.659 --> 07:33.959
Guy was with his son right
before he died. Suspect.

07:33.994 --> 07:34.994
Victim.

07:35.559 --> 07:37.259
Abdul Mohammed Bakr,

07:37.559 --> 07:39.359
age 23, Lance Corporal.

07:39.559 --> 07:41.259
Served in First FAST Company.

07:41.359 --> 07:43.859
Bronze Star and Purple
Heart for service in Iraq.

07:44.159 --> 07:45.859
Three tours, boss. He kept going back.

07:46.459 --> 07:48.259
If he stayed, he might still be alive.

07:49.359 --> 07:50.659
Hypothetically, Boss.

07:51.459 --> 07:53.559
- What else?
- Had some run-ins with the law.

07:53.659 --> 07:55.759
- Arrests?
- Assault and battery, twice.

07:55.794 --> 07:57.824
Here in DC, both cases were dismissed.

07:57.859 --> 08:00.759
Maybe they gave him favorable treatment
because he was serving in Iraq.

08:00.794 --> 08:01.724
Find out.

08:01.759 --> 08:03.559
Tracking down his
personnel officer, Boss.

08:03.594 --> 08:04.524
- Cameras.
- Yeah

08:04.559 --> 08:08.159
I tapped into Metro traffic cameras and
a few parking lot surveillance networks,

08:08.259 --> 08:11.559
stitched together Abdul's route
from the alley back to the mosque.

08:11.959 --> 08:14.159
There's no sign of anything until...

08:18.159 --> 08:19.159
here.

08:20.959 --> 08:24.059
Can't get a reading on the man's
face, but he did go into the alley.

08:24.159 --> 08:25.259
Back it up.

08:28.659 --> 08:29.659
Stop.

08:29.759 --> 08:30.959
Tighter his hands.

08:31.759 --> 08:32.958
He was carrying a phone.

08:33.058 --> 08:34.159
Forward.

08:35.859 --> 08:36.859
Stop.

08:39.058 --> 08:40.458
- Must have dumped it.
- McGee.

08:40.759 --> 08:42.323
Already ran the phone records, Boss.

08:42.359 --> 08:44.559
His cell didn't send or
receive any calls that day.

08:44.759 --> 08:46.159
- Find it.
- On it.

08:46.459 --> 08:48.559
Probie, you start the
search near the crime scene.

08:48.859 --> 08:50.159
We'll meet you there later.

08:50.759 --> 08:51.959
David, with me.

08:53.759 --> 08:55.059
Captain's right down here.

08:55.159 --> 08:57.259
I'm sorry, the correct
answer is "Full Metal Jacket".

08:57.294 --> 08:59.159
That was not the best Marine movie.

08:59.459 --> 09:00.524
"A Few Good Men" was.

09:00.559 --> 09:03.559
Based on the fact that I'm
right, I'm overruling you.

09:04.559 --> 09:05.859
If you're here to volunteer,

09:06.059 --> 09:08.659
- we'll take you.
- I already have a job, Captain Mills.

09:08.959 --> 09:10.059
NCIS.

09:11.859 --> 09:14.059
We're here about a Marine. Abdul Bakr.

09:14.159 --> 09:15.559
You were his personnel officer.

09:15.659 --> 09:16.659
Yeah,

09:17.359 --> 09:19.059
First FAST Company. He's in Iraq.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.459
No, he's in our morgue.

09:20.859 --> 09:22.759
He was murdered earlier today.

09:24.459 --> 09:25.459
God.

09:26.659 --> 09:29.159
- He's such a good kid.
- Well, we know he had some troubles.

09:29.459 --> 09:31.159
A few fights, he never started 'em.

09:31.359 --> 09:33.159
We would like to see
his personnel records.

09:34.359 --> 09:35.459
Sure, I'll...

09:36.459 --> 09:37.859
I'll get you everything I got.

09:40.159 --> 09:41.159
You coach?

09:42.359 --> 09:43.559
Yeah, I'm a

09:44.259 --> 09:45.759
parole officer in civilian life.

09:45.859 --> 09:48.409
- We have an after-school league.
- Civilian life?

09:48.444 --> 09:50.959
I'm a reservist, recalled
for active duty last year.

09:51.359 --> 09:52.559
Manpower issues.

09:52.759 --> 09:53.759
Iraq?

09:54.259 --> 09:55.024
Iraq.

09:55.059 --> 09:56.959
So, a parole officer
and a personnel officer,

09:56.994 --> 09:58.594
that's kind of the same thing, isn't it?

09:58.959 --> 10:02.559
Yeah, the Marine Corps likes to place
reservists in similar lines of work.

10:02.594 --> 10:04.059
Makes things run more efficiently.

10:04.159 --> 10:05.624
So in your professional opinion,

10:05.659 --> 10:08.559
you think Lance Corporal Bakr's
run-ins could have led to his murder?

10:08.659 --> 10:10.859
Maybe someone he had
a fight with came back?

10:10.959 --> 10:13.359
Nobody stayed mad at
him. He was a good kid

10:13.659 --> 10:14.659
and a great Marine.

10:14.759 --> 10:15.759
And a Muslim.

10:16.059 --> 10:17.059
Yeah.

10:17.659 --> 10:19.159
That's what the fights were about.

10:19.259 --> 10:20.659
He stuck up for his people.

10:21.459 --> 10:22.924
Hard to be a Muslim and a Marine.

10:22.959 --> 10:25.459
Was he ever sympathetic
to un-American activities?

10:25.559 --> 10:26.559
No way.

10:27.659 --> 10:28.659
Not this kid.

10:31.759 --> 10:32.724
Ducky.

10:32.759 --> 10:36.559
Just a moment, Jethro. Is the needle
in his femoral artery, Mr. Palmer?

10:36.659 --> 10:37.759
Yes, Doctor.

10:37.859 --> 10:38.859
Good.

10:39.159 --> 10:42.159
Never seen a gunshot victim with
so much blood left in his body.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.024
Rare but not unheard of.

10:44.059 --> 10:47.659
And if the bullet pierced his heart,
it would have stopped pumping instantly.

10:47.759 --> 10:50.159
And of course the pressure
of the boards on his back

10:50.194 --> 10:52.559
may have prevented gravitational loss.

10:52.759 --> 10:54.559
Right, that should do it.

10:54.659 --> 10:57.759
Take those up to Abby. Get her
to run the usual tox screen.

10:57.859 --> 10:58.859
Right away.

10:59.859 --> 11:01.659
Neatly done, Mr. Palmer.

11:01.959 --> 11:02.959
Thank you, Doctor.

11:04.959 --> 11:09.059
That young man will make a first class
medical examiner one of these days.

11:09.759 --> 11:10.759
Today?

11:11.759 --> 11:14.824
Yeah, well, until I open
him up, I can't say for sure.

11:14.859 --> 11:18.559
But all indications are that he
was killed by the gunshot wound.

11:18.759 --> 11:20.259
There are no defensive wounds,

11:20.359 --> 11:23.459
no lacerations, no
abrasions, no contusions.

11:23.759 --> 11:26.559
And unless I find intradermal bruising,

11:26.659 --> 11:28.659
no signs of a struggle.

11:29.259 --> 11:31.259
A Marine with combat
experience let someone

11:31.294 --> 11:33.776
take his weapon away
from him without a fight?

11:33.811 --> 11:36.259
Well, I only tell you
what the body tells me.

11:36.659 --> 11:38.159
Ask different questions, Duck.

11:38.659 --> 11:40.559
I will, Jethro. I assure you.

11:41.059 --> 11:42.959
Yes, well, the first question is,

11:42.994 --> 11:45.159
what damage did that

11:45.259 --> 11:47.259
bullet exactly do?

11:47.459 --> 11:48.459
Ducky, wait...

11:48.859 --> 11:50.059
Need to talk to you.

11:50.359 --> 11:52.159
Mr. Bakr has something to say.

12:02.759 --> 12:05.159
Dr. Mallard, please don't cut into him.

12:05.659 --> 12:07.859
I beg you to respect our religion.

12:08.359 --> 12:10.659
So my son can find peace in heaven.

12:10.959 --> 12:12.359
With all due respect, we have to.

12:12.459 --> 12:15.059
I beg of you, please don't do this.

12:16.859 --> 12:18.159
Sorry, there's no choice.

12:18.259 --> 12:20.459
There is a choice, Jethro. Mine.

12:23.059 --> 12:24.759
I can't do this autopsy.

12:36.373 --> 12:38.373
So what are you saying exactly?

12:38.473 --> 12:41.673
That we have an obligation to
honor faith as well as science,

12:42.073 --> 12:44.473
and in this case, the
wishes of the family.

12:44.773 --> 12:47.873
We cannot waive an autopsy in the
middle of a murder investigation.

12:47.973 --> 12:50.673
- Why not?
- Because the laws are very specific.

12:50.708 --> 12:52.238
We can try to accommodate

12:52.273 --> 12:55.738
some aspect of tradition
or religious ceremony,

12:55.773 --> 12:59.073
but we can't forfeit the most
critical aspect of the investigation.

12:59.173 --> 13:02.273
Abdul Bakr was a Marine
who died as a hero.

13:02.473 --> 13:04.773
That young man risked
his life for this country.

13:04.873 --> 13:07.173
The least we can do is
to respect him in death.

13:07.973 --> 13:09.773
He didn't die in Iraq, Ducky.

13:09.873 --> 13:11.373
Well, but that's not the point!

13:11.673 --> 13:12.838
What is the point, Duck?

13:12.873 --> 13:14.973
This country was founded on freedom,

13:15.008 --> 13:16.373
religious freedom.

13:16.573 --> 13:18.973
That family came here to practice it,

13:19.073 --> 13:21.673
and I can't ignore a basic
tenet of their beliefs:

13:21.973 --> 13:23.573
That if I cut open the body,

13:23.973 --> 13:26.773
that will prevent their son
from finding peace in heaven.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.473
There is no greater sin.

13:28.673 --> 13:29.673
What about murder?

13:31.973 --> 13:33.973
We need to find a cause of death.

13:34.273 --> 13:36.323
We need to find evidence.

13:36.358 --> 13:38.373
You need to do the autopsy.

13:39.073 --> 13:40.073
That's it.

13:41.173 --> 13:42.473
All right, I'll do it.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.373
Under protest.

13:45.673 --> 13:47.673
I have another body to examine.

13:47.773 --> 13:49.073
So this will have to wait.

13:49.173 --> 13:50.173
Why?

13:50.673 --> 13:52.073
I already told you why.

13:52.573 --> 13:53.573
Why?

13:55.973 --> 13:59.073
This case brings back
memories of a mass grave.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.873
I was a volunteer medical examiner

14:01.973 --> 14:05.073
for a UN task force in Bosnia in '93.

14:05.373 --> 14:08.173
I did 44 autopsies in five days,

14:08.473 --> 14:10.673
most of them children under 12,

14:10.973 --> 14:12.373
all Muslims.

14:13.073 --> 14:16.473
The village was targeted because of
who they were or who they weren't.

14:16.573 --> 14:17.773
Nothing more.

14:18.473 --> 14:20.573
Selected for their ethnicity.

14:22.273 --> 14:25.673
The parents begged me not
to autopsy their children.

14:25.973 --> 14:27.473
Begged me on their knees.

14:28.173 --> 14:29.473
But I had no choice.

14:31.173 --> 14:32.873
I suppose I still don't.

14:34.073 --> 14:36.073
I'll give you my report when I'm done.

14:42.473 --> 14:44.473
His phone's got to be
around here somewhere.

14:44.773 --> 14:45.873
Waiting.

14:46.473 --> 14:47.573
"Juicy Fruit".

14:47.673 --> 14:49.273
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Next".

14:49.308 --> 14:50.308
Close enough.

14:50.773 --> 14:53.173
"Hell, the fall will probably kill you."

14:53.473 --> 14:55.373
"Butch Cassidy and the Sunrise Kid".

14:55.473 --> 14:57.373
Great scene. Jumping off the cliff.

15:03.773 --> 15:05.273
Did you try calling the cell?

15:05.373 --> 15:07.973
Yeah. It's on silent mode,
or else I would have heard it.

15:16.373 --> 15:17.373
Found it.

15:20.273 --> 15:21.773
You scared the hell out of me.

15:22.873 --> 15:24.273
- Sir.
- You lose something?

15:24.308 --> 15:26.273
No, just escaped.

15:28.073 --> 15:29.073
Gotcha.

15:31.073 --> 15:32.073
Broken?

15:32.173 --> 15:34.273
Does a baby change its own diapers?

15:34.373 --> 15:35.138
Nay.

15:35.173 --> 15:36.773
Does it burp and feed itself?

15:36.873 --> 15:37.873
I don't think so.

15:38.073 --> 15:41.373
It takes a lot of TLC to
keep my children happy and...

15:41.473 --> 15:44.173
and fully functioning
in the lab of Abby, or.

15:44.373 --> 15:45.873
"Labby," as I like to call it.

15:46.773 --> 15:47.873
You're my favorite.

15:48.973 --> 15:49.973
Labby?

15:50.073 --> 15:51.073
You want results,

15:51.573 --> 15:52.573
you got 'em.

15:52.773 --> 15:54.073
Yeah, I want 'em.

15:54.273 --> 15:55.438
First. Fingerprints.

15:55.473 --> 15:58.473
There were a bajillion of them,
all on Lance Corporal's Koran,

15:58.508 --> 15:59.573
his clothes,

15:59.673 --> 16:01.373
but none on his misbaha.

16:02.773 --> 16:03.773
His what?

16:04.173 --> 16:05.173
Misbaha.

16:06.273 --> 16:07.673
Muslim prayer beads.

16:07.873 --> 16:09.673
It's kind of like a
rosary, but different.

16:11.273 --> 16:13.423
- And?
- I ran all the fingerprints

16:13.458 --> 16:15.573
through AFIS, Interpol, the FBI.

16:15.673 --> 16:17.738
Several worshiped at the same mosque,

16:17.773 --> 16:20.373
but there's nothing to connect
any of them to this crime.

16:20.473 --> 16:21.473
Right. Go on.

16:21.873 --> 16:23.538
Abdul's prayer rug

16:23.573 --> 16:26.873
and his boots tested
positive for phosphorus,

16:26.908 --> 16:28.973
saltpeter, Semtex and C-4.

16:29.273 --> 16:30.238
Explosives.

16:30.273 --> 16:32.173
Yeah, which could
mean one of two things.

16:32.373 --> 16:33.438
Give 'em both to me.

16:33.473 --> 16:36.973
He was serving in Iraq with FAST
company a couple of weeks ago.

16:37.073 --> 16:40.338
So if he was defusing
and handling IED's,

16:40.373 --> 16:42.673
that would account for
the traces of explosives.

16:42.708 --> 16:43.708
Or?

16:44.373 --> 16:47.473
Or... he was handling
them once he got back.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.073
That would not be good.

16:49.173 --> 16:50.173
Terrorism.

16:50.273 --> 16:52.073
I cloned and mirrored.

16:52.173 --> 16:54.573
Bakr's hard drive from his laptop.

16:54.773 --> 16:58.073
He recently visited
three Jihadist websites.

16:58.273 --> 16:59.973
It's training videos.

17:00.073 --> 17:02.173
Suicide bomber's last statements.

17:02.208 --> 17:03.773
Anti-American everything.

17:04.073 --> 17:06.873
These sites are known hubs
for al Qaeda communication.

17:07.073 --> 17:08.772
Lance Corporal Bakr visited these?

17:09.573 --> 17:13.173
Well, either him or someone
that had access to his computer.

17:13.208 --> 17:14.208
His father?

17:16.173 --> 17:17.173
Good work.

17:17.573 --> 17:18.873
Back to your babies.

17:22.573 --> 17:23.373
Hey.

17:23.573 --> 17:25.473
- Thought you checked phone records?
- I did.

17:25.573 --> 17:28.238
Technically, Abdul never
placed a call or sent a text.

17:28.272 --> 17:32.273
He did, however, press 11 keys, before
tossing his phone up on the roof.

17:32.473 --> 17:33.673
He wanted us to find it.

17:33.773 --> 17:34.773
Code.

17:35.073 --> 17:36.873
Well, basic Marine letter substitution.

17:36.908 --> 17:38.673
- Crude but very effective.
- And?

17:38.873 --> 17:40.573
Well, he may have
named his killer, Boss.

17:40.773 --> 17:42.273
Hans Staiger.

17:42.573 --> 17:44.473
Suspected ties to al Qaeda in Germany.

17:44.508 --> 17:45.773
Known as the "Recruiter".

17:45.973 --> 17:48.973
Attempted to buy off several customs
officials in France last year.

17:49.073 --> 17:50.073
Got away.

17:50.108 --> 17:51.108
Where?

17:51.173 --> 17:54.173
There's no record of Staiger coming
into this country or anywhere else.

17:54.208 --> 17:55.673
He could be here with false papers.

17:55.973 --> 17:56.973
Find him.

17:57.073 --> 17:58.038
We looked.

17:58.073 --> 17:59.673
If he's here, he's way underground.

17:59.708 --> 18:00.773
Dig deeper.

18:00.973 --> 18:02.273
- Where?
- Mosque.

18:02.473 --> 18:04.173
Bug it. That's where this all started.

18:04.273 --> 18:05.273
Getting a warrant.

18:05.373 --> 18:07.673
Would be easier if Bakr
just sent us a text message.

18:08.273 --> 18:11.573
Not if he thought someone was monitoring
or intercepting his cell transmissions.

18:11.873 --> 18:13.473
Someone was following him, Tony.

18:14.073 --> 18:15.473
"Three Days of the Condor"?

18:15.673 --> 18:18.173
Based on the novel "Six Days
of the Condor" by James Grady.

18:18.208 --> 18:20.673
Hey, I got one for you two.
Find out who killed my Marine.

18:23.673 --> 18:24.973
Nobody likes a know-it-all.

18:25.073 --> 18:26.073
Gibbs does.

18:26.373 --> 18:27.673
Warrant just came through.

18:31.773 --> 18:33.873
Anyone else have a problem with this?

18:33.973 --> 18:35.473
Bugging a place of worship?

18:36.473 --> 18:38.473
Check. One, two, three, four.

18:38.573 --> 18:40.473
If this were a Catholic
church or a doctor's

18:40.508 --> 18:42.073
office, we'd still be judge-hunting.

18:43.073 --> 18:45.873
I agree. It should not be
so easy bugging a mosque.

18:46.173 --> 18:47.673
Give it to me. I'm going in.

18:48.373 --> 18:50.473
You're a woman. It'd be
easier for me to blend in.

18:51.773 --> 18:54.873
- Yes, you would blend right in.
- All right, then we'll flip for it.

18:55.073 --> 18:56.873
If I flip you, you will get hurt.

18:56.908 --> 18:58.273
You can take her, Probie.

18:58.873 --> 18:59.873
Do it.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.573
Compromise.

19:01.873 --> 19:02.973
Tony will do it.

19:03.573 --> 19:04.773
I don't want to do it.

19:06.873 --> 19:07.938
That's impossible.

19:07.973 --> 19:09.438
We haven't even planted a bug yet.

19:09.473 --> 19:11.773
There's a transmission
coming from inside the mosque.

19:12.073 --> 19:13.473
It's already being bugged?

19:14.673 --> 19:17.273
We tracked the signal back to the FBI

19:17.308 --> 19:18.873
frequency, Mr. Langer.

19:18.973 --> 19:21.973
I checked and no warrant
was issued to the FBI.

19:22.373 --> 19:24.073
I can't confirm

19:24.373 --> 19:27.073
or deny if the mosque
is under FBI observation.

19:27.773 --> 19:29.473
This is a murder investigation.

19:29.773 --> 19:33.073
Some interagency
cooperation would be nice.

19:33.673 --> 19:34.873
Anything we should know?

19:35.973 --> 19:37.273
Not that I can tell you.

19:37.873 --> 19:38.873
That's crap.

19:39.873 --> 19:42.473
We both know that you can
say anything you want to.

19:47.573 --> 19:49.073
Did I come at a bad time?

19:50.973 --> 19:51.973
Jethro.

19:53.073 --> 19:55.273
- How are you?
- How'd they let you in here, newbie?

19:57.873 --> 19:59.573
Man, it's been a long time.

20:00.173 --> 20:02.773
You two know each other. How nice.

20:02.973 --> 20:04.573
Taught him everything he's forgotten.

20:05.473 --> 20:06.873
I thought you retired.

20:06.973 --> 20:07.973
I tried.

20:09.173 --> 20:10.473
You look good, old man.

20:10.773 --> 20:12.173
Hey, listen, sorry about our

20:12.673 --> 20:14.573
inconvenient convergence here.

20:14.608 --> 20:15.608
Our what?

20:17.473 --> 20:20.373
Gibbs used to fine me for
every three-dollar word I used.

20:20.873 --> 20:21.973
How much?

20:23.473 --> 20:25.773
- Three dollars a word.
- You owe me six.

20:25.973 --> 20:26.973
See.

20:28.473 --> 20:29.473
Marines.

20:30.773 --> 20:32.373
No, actually, I started here.

20:32.673 --> 20:34.073
Gibbs took me under his wing

20:34.473 --> 20:36.173
and then proceed to crush me.

20:36.273 --> 20:37.773
Nothing you didn't deserve.

20:37.973 --> 20:40.173
Left me no choice but
to crawl over to the FBI.

20:40.208 --> 20:41.673
Yeah, and they actually hired you.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.073
Yeah, can you believe that?

20:44.973 --> 20:47.473
Well, now maybe the NCIS and the FBI

20:47.508 --> 20:49.973
can cooperate on this investigation?

20:50.973 --> 20:52.773
We may be observing the mosque.

20:53.873 --> 20:55.173
Well, that's a little vague.

20:55.473 --> 20:57.873
I can't tell you any more than
that, Jethro. You know that.

20:58.873 --> 20:59.873
Okay.

21:00.573 --> 21:02.573
Well, I hope we don't
get in each other's way.

21:05.273 --> 21:07.673
Well, now if you guys
find anything out then...

21:07.773 --> 21:09.073
You'll be the last to know.

21:10.973 --> 21:12.073
Hey, come on.

21:12.573 --> 21:13.773
Excuse me, Director.

21:14.973 --> 21:16.773
Jethro, I think I have it.

21:16.873 --> 21:17.838
Have what?

21:17.873 --> 21:20.973
A way to find the cause of
Lance Corporal Bakr's death.

21:21.008 --> 21:22.438
You're going to do that autopsy?

21:22.473 --> 21:25.373
No. Well, yes. Well, in,
in a manner of speaking.

21:25.473 --> 21:28.573
But a lot of people are going
to have to look the other way.

21:29.373 --> 21:31.273
Starting with you, Director.

21:45.669 --> 21:46.669
Lost?

21:46.769 --> 21:49.469
Actually, I was looking for
Agent Gibbs. He was just...

21:50.169 --> 21:51.169
just...

21:51.769 --> 21:52.969
upstairs a minute ago.

21:57.069 --> 21:58.169
Can I help you?

21:58.869 --> 21:59.869
Yeah. You...

21:59.969 --> 22:02.669
Maybe you could give him my
card and ask him to call me.

22:05.569 --> 22:08.069
I'm Special Agent Anthony
DiNozzo. I'm in charge here.

22:08.369 --> 22:11.869
Well, hey, I'm Special Agent Brent
Langer FBI. You know that's weird.

22:11.904 --> 22:14.469
I could've sworn that Agent
Gibbs said he was in charge.

22:15.869 --> 22:16.869
He is.

22:17.669 --> 22:18.869
Well, yeah,

22:19.169 --> 22:21.880
he's in charge when he's here, but
when he's not here, I'm in charge.

22:21.904 --> 22:22.904
I'm in charge.

22:24.169 --> 22:25.569
Well, I'll just call him later.

22:25.669 --> 22:26.469
But

22:26.669 --> 22:27.969
thanks anyway.

22:32.269 --> 22:33.569
What an ass.

22:33.604 --> 22:34.869
Yes, indeed.

22:35.769 --> 22:37.869
You're Langer-leering.
You're leering at Langer.

22:38.269 --> 22:39.369
What if I am, Tony?

22:39.404 --> 22:40.404
He's cute.

22:42.069 --> 22:45.769
- "Cute". He's not cute. He's like...
- Don't speak.

22:46.969 --> 22:48.169
"Bullets Over Broadway".

22:48.369 --> 22:49.369
Woody Allen.

22:49.569 --> 22:50.669
Very good.

22:51.069 --> 22:52.434
You'd get a "B" in my class.

22:52.469 --> 22:54.469
- I could teach your class.
- Yeah, right.

22:56.869 --> 22:58.234
Officer David.

22:58.269 --> 23:00.869
I'm going to need you to come
down to the evidence garage,

23:00.969 --> 23:03.069
and I need you to
bring someone with you.

23:04.969 --> 23:07.569
The key here, Jethro, is discretion.

23:08.969 --> 23:11.834
We're not going through
official channels, Mr. Palmer.

23:11.869 --> 23:15.469
Official channels take time.
That's the one thing we don't have.

23:15.569 --> 23:17.134
Muslims desire their

23:17.169 --> 23:20.169
dead to be buried within 24 hours.

23:20.469 --> 23:22.769
That leaves us 13.

23:27.369 --> 23:29.169
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

23:29.969 --> 23:31.269
You have 20 minutes.

23:31.469 --> 23:34.769
A minute longer, you'll get found
out and I'll get fired. Clear?

23:35.269 --> 23:36.769
How do I repay you?

23:36.869 --> 23:38.469
I just repaid you.

23:39.069 --> 23:40.169
We're even now.

23:57.369 --> 23:59.369
Something wrong, Mr. Palmer?

23:59.869 --> 24:01.969
If this weren't a Muslim
family, we wouldn't be here.

24:02.169 --> 24:03.134
That is correct.

24:03.169 --> 24:05.269
I don't think anyone should
get special treatment.

24:05.304 --> 24:06.969
We're risking our careers by doing this.

24:07.004 --> 24:08.469
You can always leave.

24:09.069 --> 24:11.469
- Doctor, I wasn't with you in Bosnia.
- True.

24:11.769 --> 24:13.969
And I certainly wasn't on the Crusades.

24:14.369 --> 24:15.469
But 9/11.

24:15.569 --> 24:17.134
The Intifada. Hamas.

24:17.169 --> 24:19.369
You have a problem with
Muslims, Mr. Palmer?

24:19.769 --> 24:21.569
No. No, I do not.

24:21.669 --> 24:24.169
But it seems like they
have a problem with us.

24:24.269 --> 24:27.869
Religions have been the basis
of conflict for generations.

24:29.069 --> 24:32.969
- So we just live with this?
- Until we learn to respect one another.

24:41.969 --> 24:45.569
All right, Mr. Palmer, let's
follow the path of the bullet.

24:48.069 --> 24:49.769
The resolution's astonishing.

24:49.969 --> 24:52.069
Yes, and magnification...

24:54.169 --> 24:56.969
You can actually almost see as
well as a traditional autopsy.

24:57.469 --> 24:59.334
Angle of the trajectory indicates

24:59.369 --> 25:02.169
the bullet traveled through the
first intercostal space avoiding

25:02.204 --> 25:04.569
the heart and bronchial
branch of the lungs.

25:04.669 --> 25:06.169
Missed all vital organs.

25:06.769 --> 25:09.369
Went to the third intercostal space and

25:09.769 --> 25:11.069
exited the back.

25:11.569 --> 25:12.769
Hold your horses.

25:13.069 --> 25:15.569
There seems to be a bullet fragment

25:15.604 --> 25:17.369
chipped off the eighth rib

25:17.869 --> 25:19.069
and then disappeared.

25:19.369 --> 25:20.869
There's no other exit wounds.

25:20.969 --> 25:22.469
Is the fragment still in his body?

25:22.669 --> 25:24.169
Density's becoming an issue.

25:24.569 --> 25:27.369
We're seeing too much bone
and not enough soft tissue.

25:28.169 --> 25:29.169
MRI?

25:30.269 --> 25:31.469
Excellent idea.

25:43.569 --> 25:44.569
Tea?

25:45.269 --> 25:46.769
You shouldn't have, but thank you.

25:48.869 --> 25:50.469
Well, if you change your mind.

25:52.069 --> 25:53.469
You're an Israeli Jew, no?

25:54.569 --> 25:55.569
Yes.

25:55.769 --> 25:57.469
I used to take my family to Haifa.

25:58.969 --> 26:00.269
I spent my summers in Haifa.

26:02.869 --> 26:04.369
No, just push it to one side.

26:04.404 --> 26:05.869
You make it Arab style?

26:08.669 --> 26:09.669
Strong.

26:11.469 --> 26:12.569
I like strong.

26:14.769 --> 26:15.769
You like Muslims?

26:16.869 --> 26:17.869
Yes.

26:18.469 --> 26:19.469
May I ask why?

26:19.969 --> 26:21.969
I mean, I don't wish to offend you.

26:22.269 --> 26:23.369
I'm just curious.

26:25.869 --> 26:27.369
When you grow up in Israel,

26:27.669 --> 26:29.169
most of your neighbors are Muslim.

26:29.569 --> 26:31.269
My best friend was Muslim Arab.

26:31.469 --> 26:32.669
He was a young boy.

26:33.469 --> 26:34.769
We were very close.

26:35.869 --> 26:36.969
Are you still close?

26:37.869 --> 26:38.869
No.

26:39.169 --> 26:40.969
He was killed when I was 12.

26:41.669 --> 26:43.169
By an Israeli missile strike

26:43.269 --> 26:44.769
on a hotel.

26:46.269 --> 26:47.969
There has been too much death.

26:50.269 --> 26:51.369
I agree.

26:59.469 --> 27:00.469
Come on now.

27:01.069 --> 27:03.169
Show us this bullet fragment.

27:04.569 --> 27:05.769
What is it, Mr. Palmer?

27:06.569 --> 27:07.569
It's moving.

27:07.969 --> 27:08.969
His neck.

27:09.969 --> 27:11.169
Is that a bullet fragment?

27:11.269 --> 27:12.569
No, bullets are lead.

27:12.669 --> 27:14.269
They're non-magnetic.

27:16.269 --> 27:17.469
Turn off the power.

27:26.169 --> 27:27.234
What is it?

27:27.269 --> 27:28.969
This, my dear Officer David,

27:29.369 --> 27:30.769
is what you call

27:31.369 --> 27:33.869
an unexpected turn of events.

27:38.969 --> 27:39.834
Abby.

27:39.869 --> 27:41.969
Yay! It worked.

27:42.069 --> 27:44.769
- What?
- My Gibbs early warning alarm system.

27:44.869 --> 27:47.069
The Arabs used to put dried
brush outside their tents

27:47.169 --> 27:48.969
to alert them in case
there was an intruder.

27:49.269 --> 27:50.769
So I just updated it to bubble wrap.

27:51.369 --> 27:52.369
You called me.

27:52.769 --> 27:54.369
I know. It was a test.

27:54.469 --> 27:55.869
You want to know what I found.

27:57.069 --> 27:58.069
Trippy.

27:59.169 --> 28:00.169
I like it.

28:00.669 --> 28:04.369
I was able to extract an undiluted
sample from inside the needle shaft.

28:04.469 --> 28:08.269
And voilą, I give you
the blue-ringed octopus.

28:08.569 --> 28:09.569
A what?

28:10.169 --> 28:14.269
It produces a toxin that's a hundred
times more deadly than cobra venom.

28:14.469 --> 28:17.134
It's the most deadly natural neurotoxin

28:17.169 --> 28:20.269
on the planet, and it's impossible
to trace in the bloodstream.

28:20.769 --> 28:21.734
You did.

28:21.769 --> 28:23.569
Well, because it wasn't
in the bloodstream.

28:23.669 --> 28:25.669
It was still inside the
needle shaft Ducky found,

28:25.769 --> 28:27.269
perfectly preserved and pure.

28:27.469 --> 28:28.634
He walked a long way.

28:28.669 --> 28:30.869
Because the needle snapped
off during insertion.

28:30.969 --> 28:32.869
It was a result of oxidation and age,

28:32.969 --> 28:35.169
so that resulted in metal fatigue.

28:35.204 --> 28:37.234
Lance Corporal Bakr,

28:37.269 --> 28:38.634
he only got a partial dose.

28:38.669 --> 28:40.269
That's why he could walk for two blocks.

28:40.369 --> 28:42.169
- Yeah, but it killed him.
- Yeah...

28:42.669 --> 28:43.769
or the bullet.

28:43.869 --> 28:45.134
I mean, it's hard to say.

28:45.169 --> 28:46.669
I'm running the toxicology now.

28:48.069 --> 28:49.269
Aren't you gonna ask me?

28:50.169 --> 28:50.969
What?

28:51.069 --> 28:53.769
Why the needle was
affected by magnetic force.

28:53.869 --> 28:55.969
I mean, they make
these out of 440 carbon.

28:56.069 --> 28:58.169
It's a non-magnetic steel.

28:58.204 --> 28:58.969
Why?

28:59.169 --> 29:02.269
Because... the needle was really old.

29:02.369 --> 29:03.469
It was, like,

29:03.769 --> 29:05.269
from the '70s.

29:07.669 --> 29:09.269
Not that that's...

29:09.569 --> 29:10.969
That's not old.

29:11.269 --> 29:13.569
I mean, well, it's old for a needle,

29:13.669 --> 29:14.769
sure, but it's certainly

29:15.069 --> 29:16.269
not old for,

29:16.569 --> 29:18.769
you know, a man.

29:21.169 --> 29:22.169
Where?

29:22.369 --> 29:25.569
There's two companies in the
United States that handle the toxin.

29:25.669 --> 29:27.769
They use it for research on antivenoms.

29:27.869 --> 29:29.969
- They're both in the DC area.
- Names?

29:30.769 --> 29:33.669
- Morgan Industries and Bio-Tonics.
- Have an e-mail sent...

29:33.704 --> 29:35.769
I already e-mailed
it to McGee and Tony.

29:36.269 --> 29:37.369
You're my favorite.

29:38.269 --> 29:39.269
Abs...

29:39.769 --> 29:40.969
Lose the bubble wrap.

29:44.069 --> 29:45.069
Go, McGoo.

29:45.169 --> 29:46.769
Morgan Industries is clean.

29:46.969 --> 29:49.369
Got it. Probie's over
at Morgan Industries.

29:49.769 --> 29:51.369
They show no missing venom.

29:52.169 --> 29:53.169
Can I help you?

29:53.269 --> 29:55.569
Yes, we need to check your records.

29:58.169 --> 29:59.834
You see? Every drop accounted for.

29:59.869 --> 30:02.269
- There's none missing from inventory.
- Check again.

30:03.369 --> 30:05.969
I've checked four times. I'm
telling you, we watch this stuff.

30:07.569 --> 30:08.769
Here you go.

30:08.804 --> 30:09.804
Okay.

30:09.969 --> 30:11.069
"Paycheck".

30:11.469 --> 30:13.469
- Ben Affleck, Uma Thurman?
- That's right.

30:13.769 --> 30:15.069
Ben plays the bad guy,

30:15.169 --> 30:17.869
does dirty work for this company
and then they erase his memory.

30:18.369 --> 30:20.969
Beats the bad guys by
mailing clues to himself.

30:21.369 --> 30:23.369
We are going to need all
your shipping manifests.

30:23.769 --> 30:24.769
Originals.

30:25.069 --> 30:27.769
Everything that's been sent out
of here in the last six months.

30:27.869 --> 30:30.469
McGee can go back and do the
same at Morgan Industries.

30:30.569 --> 30:32.369
That's a lot of inventory to check.

30:32.869 --> 30:33.969
We got time.

30:34.369 --> 30:35.369
Okay.

30:36.069 --> 30:37.069
Hey!

30:37.769 --> 30:39.269
Where are you going, Jackrabbit?

30:40.669 --> 30:41.834
I'm going to paradise.

30:41.869 --> 30:43.769
- Where are you going?
- To the parking lot.

30:43.869 --> 30:45.569
Put your butt in the back of our car.

30:50.269 --> 30:51.034
Go.

30:51.069 --> 30:53.669
Hacked into Bio-Tonics
worldwide tracking software.

30:53.769 --> 30:57.469
We followed a shipment of the neurotoxin
from Bio-Tonics to Stanford University,

30:57.504 --> 30:59.569
except the university
never received the shipment.

30:59.604 --> 31:01.636
But as you can see,
Bio-Tonics tracking shows

31:01.671 --> 31:03.669
that the venom was
ordered and delivered.

31:03.869 --> 31:06.169
- Who signed for it?
- Nobody. It never got there.

31:06.369 --> 31:09.469
It turns out that the university
never even ordered the neurotoxin,

31:09.504 --> 31:11.786
so there was nothing
missing from the warehouse.

31:11.821 --> 31:14.069
Enabling them to walk out
the front door with it.

31:14.104 --> 31:15.769
- Who?
- Ryan Sikes, shipping clerk.

31:15.804 --> 31:17.069
Thinks he's a jackrabbit.

31:17.169 --> 31:18.469
And an ex-con.

31:18.569 --> 31:19.969
Did time for armed robbery,

31:20.069 --> 31:22.369
computer crimes, other assorted tidbits.

31:22.669 --> 31:24.469
In prison, he converted to Islam.

31:24.669 --> 31:25.969
- Get him.
- Got him.

31:26.169 --> 31:27.169
Good.

31:30.769 --> 31:33.069
There is only one God and He is great.

31:33.369 --> 31:34.669
That's good to know.

31:35.169 --> 31:36.569
Why'd you kill Corporal Bakr?

31:37.169 --> 31:40.369
Why has this country killed a
hundred thousand Iraqi civilians

31:40.569 --> 31:42.569
and 30,000 sick children

31:42.669 --> 31:44.269
after they invaded the first time?

31:44.769 --> 31:46.269
Corporal Bakr was a Muslim.

31:46.669 --> 31:47.869
You're a Muslim.

31:48.469 --> 31:49.769
Killing him, that's a sin.

31:49.969 --> 31:52.269
How many civilians
have the Marines killed

31:52.669 --> 31:53.969
on Muslim soil?

31:54.169 --> 31:56.469
I'm talking about a
Marine on American soil.

31:58.369 --> 31:59.369
Ryan.

32:00.369 --> 32:02.569
Ryan is my slave name.

32:03.469 --> 32:05.669
My real name is Akbur

32:06.169 --> 32:07.134
Mohammed.

32:07.169 --> 32:08.269
Your slave name?

32:08.369 --> 32:09.369
Yes.

32:09.469 --> 32:10.769
You want a statement?

32:11.369 --> 32:12.369
Death

32:12.769 --> 32:13.969
to America.

32:14.269 --> 32:15.369
You want a confession?

32:15.969 --> 32:17.034
I did it.

32:17.069 --> 32:18.819
I killed that turncoat bastard.

32:18.854 --> 32:20.569
He turned against his own people...

32:20.604 --> 32:21.669
Hey, what are you...?!

32:24.269 --> 32:25.369
He didn't even look.

32:25.669 --> 32:26.769
Gibbs doesn't need to.

32:28.369 --> 32:29.469
Get in here!

32:34.669 --> 32:36.169
Were you gonna tell me about this?

32:36.269 --> 32:38.269
The ankle bracelet was a
condition of his parole.

32:38.469 --> 32:40.934
We have requested the tracking
records from the parole office.

32:40.969 --> 32:43.869
Be able to put him in the alley at
exactly the time Abdul was killed.

32:43.904 --> 32:45.269
I already confessed.

32:45.469 --> 32:46.569
Now, I killed him.

32:47.369 --> 32:48.369
Boss?

32:48.469 --> 32:49.469
Bad news.

32:49.869 --> 32:51.669
Just got the tracking records back.

32:51.769 --> 32:53.834
GPS records show that Sikes was

32:53.869 --> 32:56.569
20 miles away from the crime
scene at the time of the murder.

32:57.776 --> 33:00.276
He's got an airtight
alibi, the US government.

33:10.643 --> 33:11.943
Waiting on you, newbie.

33:14.043 --> 33:15.843
Are you still working on this damn boat?

33:17.043 --> 33:18.343
Finished it twice.

33:18.643 --> 33:19.943
This is number three.

33:20.643 --> 33:22.243
And still drinking the same beer.

33:23.843 --> 33:24.943
So, yes,

33:25.443 --> 33:28.243
we think the mosque is a
recruitment center for al Qaeda.

33:28.843 --> 33:30.043
The cell in DC?

33:31.243 --> 33:32.043
No.

33:32.143 --> 33:34.043
Al Qaeda's changed their business model.

33:34.078 --> 33:35.943
We think they're
paying people now, cash,

33:36.443 --> 33:38.743
to Muslims and
non-Muslims, US citizens.

33:38.943 --> 33:40.343
Capitalist jihad.

33:40.543 --> 33:41.543
Smart.

33:41.643 --> 33:42.943
More like dangerous.

33:43.343 --> 33:45.943
We're pretty good at monitoring
radicalized citizens, but, now,

33:46.143 --> 33:48.943
anyone with a need or greed might
be playing on their team, who knows.

33:48.978 --> 33:51.043
- You think our murder is connected?
- Possible.

33:51.743 --> 33:53.843
The dead Marine's father,
he's on our watch list.

33:55.043 --> 33:56.043
Why?

34:00.443 --> 34:03.043
Everything we've got is
on this, and it's not much.

34:03.343 --> 34:05.743
To be perfectly honest with
you, I'm not even sure why we're

34:05.778 --> 34:08.010
investigating. Homeland
is working on something,

34:08.045 --> 34:10.243
but it's so compartmentalized,
no one's sharing.

34:10.342 --> 34:11.643
MP3 files.

34:11.842 --> 34:14.243
Last six months of recordings
from inside the mosque.

34:15.043 --> 34:17.643
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me. I was never here.

34:20.243 --> 34:22.043
You ever consider using power tools?

34:23.543 --> 34:25.342
You are still a pain in the ass.

34:25.842 --> 34:27.543
I learned from the best.

34:28.143 --> 34:29.342
Catch you later, Boss.

34:40.643 --> 34:43.743
Khalid is asking for some money to
be made as a donation to the mosque.

34:52.943 --> 34:56.543
This other man is speaking Arabic,
but it is not his first language.

34:56.842 --> 34:58.143
Think he could be German.

34:58.178 --> 34:59.178
What's he saying?

34:59.343 --> 35:02.343
Khalid is accepting cash paid
through an offshore account.

35:04.843 --> 35:07.543
Running the voices through
Interpol, FBI and databases.

35:08.043 --> 35:09.343
Start with Hans Staiger.

35:13.043 --> 35:15.243
Positive ID, boss, it's Staiger.

35:16.043 --> 35:18.743
Suspected al Qaeda recruiter.
Wanted in four countries.

35:18.843 --> 35:20.043
No face, no prints,

35:20.643 --> 35:22.543
just calls intercepted
over the last year.

35:24.143 --> 35:25.943
We don't know who he
is, just that he is.

35:26.343 --> 35:28.043
And that he's talking to Khalid.

36:03.343 --> 36:04.343
You're okay?

36:05.143 --> 36:06.143
Yeah, I'm fine.

36:08.043 --> 36:09.643
The funeral home is sending a car.

36:10.343 --> 36:12.243
- Thank you, again.
- Thank you.

36:12.643 --> 36:15.843
Your son was a great credit
to his country and his culture.

36:17.043 --> 36:20.443
Jethro, he family has requested
his personal effects to be returned.

36:29.643 --> 36:31.243
Anything you want to tell me?

36:31.543 --> 36:32.543
About?

36:33.743 --> 36:34.743
Anything.

36:37.343 --> 36:39.043
- Why do you hate us?
- I don't.

36:39.343 --> 36:40.443
Your people do.

36:41.643 --> 36:44.843
All we ask for, is to live in
peace and observe our beliefs.

36:46.643 --> 36:47.643
I think you are.

36:48.043 --> 36:50.843
Islam came to your country
with hostility in 2001,

36:51.143 --> 36:52.243
and that was wrong.

36:53.443 --> 36:57.243
But you came to our land 500
years ago and you've never left.

36:58.243 --> 37:02.143
All we wish for, is to be left
alone to practice our ways,

37:02.843 --> 37:04.443
and yet you cannot leave us alone.

37:05.043 --> 37:06.043
Why?

37:06.343 --> 37:09.343
Why did the recruiter kill
your son, because he said "no"

37:09.443 --> 37:10.843
or because he said "yes"?

37:13.543 --> 37:14.543
There is a man.

37:14.943 --> 37:16.343
- A German.
- Hans Staiger.

37:17.043 --> 37:18.443
He recruits for al Qaeda.

37:18.843 --> 37:20.943
This recruiter approached my son.

37:21.443 --> 37:24.343
Abdul was gathering
information for the authorities.

37:24.843 --> 37:26.843
A spy for his government.

37:27.943 --> 37:29.143
I called the FBI.

37:29.943 --> 37:32.343
I called them to
investigate my own mosque.

37:32.743 --> 37:34.543
I killed my own son.

37:35.443 --> 37:36.443
No, you didn't.

37:37.043 --> 37:38.443
But until we find who did,

37:39.543 --> 37:41.343
we need to keep his
body a little longer.

37:42.643 --> 37:43.843
Find this recruiter

37:45.043 --> 37:47.143
and allow me to have my vengeance.

37:48.343 --> 37:49.343
Please.

37:51.343 --> 37:52.343
He's mine.

37:58.743 --> 37:59.943
The body stays, Duck.

38:00.143 --> 38:01.443
I already released the body.

38:01.943 --> 38:03.043
Well, un-release it.

38:04.443 --> 38:05.943
I determined a cause of death.

38:06.243 --> 38:08.343
The poison may have weakened his system,

38:08.543 --> 38:10.143
but it was the gunshot that killed him.

38:11.343 --> 38:13.043
The body stays.

38:14.043 --> 38:15.643
Until we find our killer.

38:26.043 --> 38:27.843
- I have killed for less.
- You cheated.

38:27.878 --> 38:29.310
- Did not.
- Yes, you did.

38:29.345 --> 38:30.743
That is a book of movies.

38:30.843 --> 38:33.543
I bet you never saw all those
movies, you just read the book.

38:33.643 --> 38:35.443
- I like books.
- I like movies.

38:35.543 --> 38:37.243
Don't quote books, I
will not quote movies.

38:37.343 --> 38:39.443
What if it's a book that's
been made into a movie?

38:39.643 --> 38:40.643
Patterns.

38:41.543 --> 38:43.443
George C. Scott, 1970,
won seven Academy Awards,

38:43.543 --> 38:45.343
- including Best Picture, boss.
- Patterns.

38:45.543 --> 38:46.943
Patterns, not "Patton".

38:47.643 --> 38:48.643
Patterns?

38:48.843 --> 38:50.743
If this is al Qaeda,
that means activity.

38:51.043 --> 38:52.643
Activity means patterns.

38:52.743 --> 38:54.043
Dead Marines who are Muslims.

38:54.443 --> 38:55.443
Checking.

38:57.343 --> 38:58.843
That's all we've got, two of them.

38:58.943 --> 39:00.743
A Shiite Muslim stationed at Camp David.

39:01.043 --> 39:03.043
Died of unknown causes two weeks ago.

39:03.243 --> 39:05.843
Sergeant Major out of
Norfolk, Sunni, died last week.

39:06.043 --> 39:07.343
Both were stationed in Iraq,

39:07.443 --> 39:09.043
both had run-ins with the law.

39:09.143 --> 39:12.043
- Both died of natural causes.
- They have something else in common.

39:12.943 --> 39:14.443
- What?
- They're both dead.

39:14.843 --> 39:15.943
No. Something else.

39:16.943 --> 39:18.043
- What?
- What?

39:20.643 --> 39:22.143
Same personnel officer.

39:25.043 --> 39:26.043
Look,

39:26.443 --> 39:27.443
I'm a patriot.

39:27.943 --> 39:29.743
I'm a volunteer reservist.

39:31.343 --> 39:32.543
With money problems.

39:32.943 --> 39:35.743
You're divorcing your wife,
claimed you were broke in court,

39:35.943 --> 39:38.543
you oversee a lot of drug
addicts, access to needles,

39:39.043 --> 39:40.443
access to Brian Sikes.

39:40.543 --> 39:43.643
Which gave you access to the
toxins used to kill three Marines.

39:44.543 --> 39:47.143
We found $270,000 in your shed.

39:47.443 --> 39:49.143
I guess your money problems are over.

39:49.343 --> 39:51.243
What exactly are you charging me with?

39:51.443 --> 39:54.643
A German named Hans
Staiger was paying you

39:54.943 --> 39:58.543
to help recruit troubled Muslim
Marines to serve for the other side.

39:58.643 --> 40:01.043
Two of them obviously
refused and are now dead.

40:02.043 --> 40:03.243
I'm a parole officer,

40:03.443 --> 40:05.243
I know how the system works. Lawyer...

40:06.943 --> 40:09.043
- right now.
- You killed a Marine yesterday.

40:09.743 --> 40:12.143
- Shot him with his own gun.
- Why would I do that?

40:12.343 --> 40:13.643
To make sure he was dead.

40:14.843 --> 40:18.643
"Natural causes" didn't work as well
for him as it did for the other two,

40:18.678 --> 40:20.243
so you followed him and you shot him.

40:22.443 --> 40:23.443
Lawyer.

40:24.843 --> 40:25.843
Boss. Sorry.

40:25.943 --> 40:27.543
Ducky needs you. Now.

40:27.843 --> 40:28.843
Sorry.

40:30.243 --> 40:31.243
Sorry.

40:32.643 --> 40:33.643
I was wrong.

40:35.543 --> 40:37.543
- About what?
- The gunshot.

40:38.043 --> 40:39.543
Abby's toxicology report.

40:39.843 --> 40:41.643
Abdul was dead before he was shot.

40:41.843 --> 40:43.843
Some of the poison did
get into his system.

40:43.943 --> 40:46.343
If your personnel officer did shoot him,

40:46.643 --> 40:47.743
he didn't kill him.

40:48.543 --> 40:51.743
The most you could legally prove
is that he desecrated a body.

40:52.243 --> 40:54.943
If we don't have him for murder,
he'll never give up the recruiter.

41:08.343 --> 41:11.943
We just matched the slug
from Abdul's body to your gun,

41:12.443 --> 41:13.443
not his.

41:14.343 --> 41:15.943
- That's impossible.
- Yeah.

41:16.543 --> 41:19.343
And a good lawyer could prove that,
but you're not getting a lawyer.

41:19.378 --> 41:20.543
You're getting a transfer

41:20.843 --> 41:23.043
to a Naval base in Cuba.

41:23.643 --> 41:24.743
It's called Gitmo.

41:25.143 --> 41:26.143
Ever heard of it?

41:28.443 --> 41:29.543
Case closed.

41:35.043 --> 41:36.343
I can give you Staiger.

41:39.143 --> 41:40.808
He's the one who injected Corporal Bakr,

41:40.843 --> 41:43.243
and the other two Marines
when they wouldn't cooperate.

41:44.543 --> 41:47.643
He said it'd be quick. The needle broke,
so he followed him from the mosque,

41:48.243 --> 41:49.243
he shot him.

41:49.943 --> 41:51.443
You just happened to be there?

41:51.743 --> 41:52.943
I was the go-between.

41:53.343 --> 41:54.443
You want more?

41:54.543 --> 41:56.143
I want a civilian case,

41:56.343 --> 41:57.943
filed with the DA's Office,

41:58.443 --> 42:01.043
with the guarantee that I won't
be prosecuted for terrorism.

42:02.243 --> 42:03.243
Deal.

42:04.543 --> 42:05.543
Staiger.

42:07.143 --> 42:08.143
Bedford Hotel.

42:09.143 --> 42:10.143
Room 126.

42:27.043 --> 42:28.243
These belong to Abdul.

42:28.643 --> 42:30.143
They were returned to his father.

42:30.743 --> 42:31.743
Are you sure?

42:33.143 --> 42:34.143
Gibbs, I...

42:39.143 --> 42:40.943
No, nothing like them.

42:42.143 --> 42:43.143
I didn't think so.
