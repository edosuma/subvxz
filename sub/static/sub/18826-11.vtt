- I can't believe

19:12.125 --> 19:15.208
you guys could be so selfish.

19:15.250 --> 19:16.375
- Don't blame us!

19:16.417 --> 19:17.917
Keeping Mae and Miles apart

19:17.959 --> 19:19.750
was all your idea.

19:19.792 --> 19:22.333
- But I realized I was wrong

19:19.792 --> 19:22.333
and tried to fix it.

19:22.375 --> 19:24.750
- By telling Mae the truth?

19:24.792 --> 19:27.083
- Well, no, but--

19:27.125 --> 19:28.458
- Now!

19:27.125 --> 19:28.458
She's distracted!

19:36.166 --> 19:37.542
- We did it!

19:37.583 --> 19:39.667
[alarm blaring]

19:37.583 --> 19:39.667
- We're going down!

19:39.709 --> 19:42.375
[all screaming]

19:46.959 --> 19:49.667
[tires squeak]

19:49.709 --> 19:52.166
[tone dinging]

19:52.208 --> 19:54.709
- We did it!

19:52.208 --> 19:54.709
We landed the plane.

19:54.750 --> 19:56.250
- But what about Dawn?

19:56.291 --> 19:58.125
We can't just leave her

19:56.291 --> 19:58.125
up there.

19:58.166 --> 19:59.834
- She's not up there, Dicky.

19:59.875 --> 20:00.959
- Yes, I am!

20:01.000 --> 20:02.500
[all screaming]

20:02.542 --> 20:03.917
- Okay, fine,

20:02.542 --> 20:03.917
we were all selfish

20:03.959 --> 20:05.041
and none of us

20:03.959 --> 20:05.041
were totally truthful.

20:05.083 --> 20:06.500
- But if you would just

20:06.542 --> 20:08.333
fly this thing,

20:06.542 --> 20:08.333
you'd understand.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.000
- I doubt it.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.000
I mean, what's so great

20:10.041 --> 20:11.625
about a big plane with no wings?

20:13.125 --> 20:14.083
This...

20:14.125 --> 20:15.333
is...

20:15.375 --> 20:17.166
awesome!

20:15.375 --> 20:17.166
[laughs]

20:17.208 --> 20:18.250
You guys were right.

20:18.291 --> 20:20.792
This was totally worth it.

20:20.834 --> 20:23.000
- Was it?

20:20.834 --> 20:23.000
- Ah!

20:23.041 --> 20:25.834
- Mae, what are you doing here?

20:25.875 --> 20:27.959
- Miles texted me that something

20:25.875 --> 20:27.959
weird was going on.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.375
And he was right.

20:30.417 --> 20:32.208
I can't believe

20:30.417 --> 20:32.208
you'd do this to me.

20:34.917 --> 20:37.959
- And I can't believe

20:34.917 --> 20:37.959
you guys would do this to me.

20:40.917 --> 20:42.000
- Dude...

20:42.041 --> 20:43.834
- Dude.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.875
- Mm. Dude.

20:45.917 --> 20:46.875
- Dude.

20:46.917 --> 20:48.625
- Dude?

20:48.667 --> 20:49.875
- Dude.

20:49.917 --> 20:52.125
[laughter]

20:52.166 --> 20:53.500
- That's it?

20:53.542 --> 20:55.166
You're all made up?

20:55.208 --> 20:57.458
- Yeah.

20:55.208 --> 20:57.458
We're dudes.

20:57.500 --> 21:00.250
- Ugh.

20:57.500 --> 21:00.250
I don't get boys sometimes.

21:00.291 --> 21:01.750
[laughter]

21:04.709 --> 21:05.417
Dude?

21:05.458 --> 21:06.458
- Girl.

21:07.041 --> 21:08.250
- Right.

21:08.291 --> 21:10.000
Look, Mae, I really am sorry.

21:10.041 --> 21:11.458
I was a jerk.

21:11.500 --> 21:12.917
I just didn't want to lose you

21:12.959 --> 21:14.834
'cause you were spending

21:12.959 --> 21:14.834
all your time with Miles,

21:14.875 --> 21:16.834
so I did something really dumb;

21:16.875 --> 21:18.542
I got my brothers involved.

21:19.542 --> 21:22.125
- I want to be mad at you,

21:19.542 --> 21:22.125
I really do,

21:22.166 --> 21:25.500
but all you really wanted to do

21:22.166 --> 21:25.500
was spend time with me,

21:25.542 --> 21:27.875
which I get,

21:25.542 --> 21:27.875
'cause I'm awesome.

21:27.917 --> 21:29.291
- [chuckles]

21:29.333 --> 21:31.750
Look, I really am sorry.

21:29.333 --> 21:31.750
- Me too.

21:31.792 --> 21:34.375
And I promise

21:31.792 --> 21:34.375
I'll always make time for you.

21:34.417 --> 21:36.250
- And I promise I will never

21:34.417 --> 21:36.250
try to drive you

21:36.291 --> 21:39.208
and Miles apart again.

21:39.250 --> 21:41.208
- Just one question:

21:41.250 --> 21:42.792
is Millie really all that?

21:42.834 --> 21:44.792
- Girl...

21:44.834 --> 21:46.625
- Dude!

21:46.667 --> 21:49.792
[laughter]

21:49.834 --> 21:52.500
- They're never coming out,

21:49.834 --> 21:52.500
are they?

21:56.959 --> 21:58.583
boys: Dude!

22:00.041 --> 22:02.000
both: Girl!

22:02.041 --> 22:05.000
