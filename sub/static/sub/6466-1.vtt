00:56.810 --> 01:01.403
-Some say it was all
caused by a virus.

01:02.672 --> 01:06.880
And truthfully, it's
much more logical than

01:06.981 --> 01:11.288
some apocalyptic event of
biblical proportions.

01:14.528 --> 01:19.179
A virus sounds more likely.
Something tiny, invisible.

01:19.479 --> 01:21.753
Carried within us.

01:23.112 --> 01:26.612
A collection of molecules,
a set of commands,

01:26.713 --> 01:31.275
fragments of microscopic codes
that float wherever there is life,

01:32.723 --> 01:37.153
waiting to attach themselves
to any living creature.

01:37.980 --> 01:41.982
And to unleash their
malicious program upon on it.

01:45.030 --> 01:52.074
Yes. A Virus sounds to me a
much more likely call.

01:57.529 --> 02:00.290
The first day and God
said, "Let there be

02:00.315 --> 02:03.140
light!" And there was light.
Genesis 1:3.

02:30.603 --> 02:32.869
-You can help instead
of just sitting there!

04:17.377 --> 04:19.380
-Are there any more?

04:23.564 --> 04:25.484
-There are only a few seconds. Run!

04:53.073 --> 04:55.419
-Are the drill charges ready?

05:30.749 --> 05:34.087
Well, what are you
waiting for? Work your magic.

06:12.593 --> 06:15.439
-Are you sure you want to
forget about the doctor thing?

06:15.464 --> 06:16.519
--If someone's badly hurt

06:16.544 --> 06:18.424
he dies. If someone
contacts the disease

06:18.449 --> 06:20.374
that requires medical
attention he dies.

06:21.056 --> 06:23.377
-We don't need a doctor.

07:10.547 --> 07:13.287
-We don't need a doctor,
but we want one.

07:14.805 --> 07:18.091
-Why take the risk?
-You want them.

07:18.407 --> 07:20.131
You think a doctor
can give you more

07:20.156 --> 07:22.141
information. Forget about it!

07:22.660 --> 07:25.846
It's a waste of time.
All that's left is

07:25.871 --> 07:28.202
to keep moving and attacking.

07:28.279 --> 07:32.514
As fast and as fierce  as possible until
they die from lack of food and water

07:32.539 --> 07:35.840
and become extinct.
-Information Is power.

07:36.267 --> 07:39.130
We need the information so that the
initiative remains in our hands.

07:39.162 --> 07:41.470
-Not that kind of information.

07:42.137 --> 07:45.804
-What about hiding in some remote desert
until this whole thing blows over?

07:45.889 --> 07:48.918
In the desert, we'll  need
a medical expert for sure.

07:49.868 --> 07:53.401
Trust my my calculations. All we
need is two trucks loaded with...

07:53.426 --> 07:54.726
-It's too dangerous!

07:55.985 --> 07:59.705
they can always turn up when we're least
prepared and then we'll be trapped.

07:59.730 --> 08:01.836
-That's not true. Come
on, remember when we met

08:01.861 --> 08:03.307
after everything fell apart?

08:03.332 --> 08:06.122
-You were sitting on your ass
waiting for a sonic boom and

08:06.146 --> 08:08.604
a down poor of nuclear
warheads to cleanse the place.

08:09.119 --> 08:10.588
-Only if they're bombers.
I told you.

08:10.613 --> 08:11.979
If they're ICBMs
or cruise missiles,

08:12.004 --> 08:15.231
You wouldn't have heard a
thing before the explosion.

08:15.256 --> 08:16.331
But we digress.

08:16.999 --> 08:18.871
Look, at one point or another

08:18.896 --> 08:22.170
we'll need to settle in
one spot and we'll need

08:22.281 --> 08:26.004
someone with medical know-how.
 -When settling in one spot is an option,

08:26.029 --> 08:30.844
perhaps. But until then,
my way is the only way.

08:30.869 --> 08:35.506
Keep moving keep attacking.
And we say when, where and how.

08:36.472 --> 08:41.553
That's not the issue, is it?
You're simply dying of curiosity.

08:41.880 --> 08:44.802
But curiosity will get you killed.

08:46.338 --> 08:49.931
-So I'm curious, so what?

08:50.566 --> 08:54.522
I don't get you.
Aren't you even a bit curious?

08:54.696 --> 08:58.016
You wake up one day and everyone
around you has turned into mindless,

08:58.041 --> 09:01.097
bloodthirsty,
pissed off zombies,

09:01.122 --> 09:03.455
and you do not want to
know how or why it happen?

09:03.480 --> 09:05.746
-No, I don't.

09:09.426 --> 09:11.946
-Besides, I need to renew
my chemical stock.

09:11.971 --> 09:13.206
Not to mention it's my turn

09:13.231 --> 09:15.566
to choose our next destination.

09:15.920 --> 09:20.461
A deployment location where
we can prepare for an ambush.

09:20.473 --> 09:21.990
Agreed.

09:23.363 --> 09:26.250
A Hospital. You choose the one.

10:47.088 --> 10:48.455
-Come on!

10:50.565 --> 10:52.599
Come on!

12:48.243 --> 12:50.956
-Abracadabra.
Let there be light!

13:11.699 --> 13:12.856
Let's go.

13:23.843 --> 13:26.069
Do you know your way around the hospital?
-Yes.

13:26.094 --> 13:28.107
-Room 318, Ward C. Go there.

13:28.184 --> 13:30.211
Lock yourselves in
 and wait. -Go!

14:29.979 --> 14:33.109
-How unlucky can we get?
we come looking for a doctor, and we find a

14:33.134 --> 14:35.890
nurse and a girl instead.

14:35.915 --> 14:38.381
-My sister isn't a nurse
She’s a senior doctor.

14:38.540 --> 14:41.668
 And I'm not just some girl...
-You've revealed too many details to two

14:41.693 --> 14:43.829
complete strangers
before we've even

14:43.854 --> 14:46.419
asked the questions.
There's no time for this.

14:46.444 --> 14:48.300
We have to get out of here.

14:49.005 --> 14:50.309
- It's okay. it's okay.

14:50.334 --> 14:53.293
It's one of ours.
We've booby-trapped the entire place.

14:55.514 --> 14:56.783
That's not right.

14:58.918 --> 15:03.083
-I suggest whoever is standing
behind that door, you better move

15:03.108 --> 15:05.222
before I blow this door to bits.

15:09.059 --> 15:13.101
-Should we run? Before it?
-No time. Turn over the bed!

15:38.083 --> 15:40.569
-I'm coming in, don't shoot.

15:46.213 --> 15:48.133
Now, get up now.
You're the one who

15:48.158 --> 15:50.558
set up that nice little
kill-zone out there.

15:51.005 --> 15:53.461
Nice, very nice. Now
all you have to do

15:53.486 --> 15:56.126
is just stand there and
pull your trigger.

15:56.303 --> 16:01.345
-What do you want?
-What do I want? What I want ?!

16:03.209 --> 16:06.015
Look at this. Look at this!

16:07.533 --> 16:11.642
They got me. I'm infected. You get that?

16:11.743 --> 16:15.243
I'm fucking infected! Now what I want

16:17.369 --> 16:20.529
is for you to take this thing out of me.

16:23.321 --> 16:26.750
I want a cure. Do you understand? A cure!

16:26.851 --> 16:29.845
And you're going to give it to me.
You out of all people!

16:31.327 --> 16:35.404
I knew you'd come here eventually.
 You and your kind.

16:35.835 --> 16:39.790
Now, what I want is for
you to take this thing out of me!

16:39.891 --> 16:43.705
-Do you know him?
-You can say we know each other.

16:44.095 --> 16:47.208
All my life I've been
hunted down by his kind.

16:47.233 --> 16:49.609
What are you? A General?

16:49.933 --> 16:54.917
No, you're too young for that.
Maybe a captain? Or Major?

16:54.942 --> 16:58.837
Ah, you're a colonel.

17:00.548 --> 17:03.122
Yeah, You must be a colonel.

17:04.066 --> 17:10.019
-He's right about one thing. Part of my job
was to hunt down  freaks like him.

17:10.636 --> 17:14.683
So yeah, you could say we know each other.
-Don't patronize me!

17:14.784 --> 17:19.314
You're not in the position to patronize me!
I'm holding the cards now.

17:19.415 --> 17:24.142
They can't see me, I'm infected.
That means that I'm invisible!

17:24.242 --> 17:27.549
Truly invisible! So you better
come up with something quick.

17:27.574 --> 17:30.066
You better come up with
something or else...

17:32.392 --> 17:34.164
-To the exit now!

18:36.695 --> 18:40.259
-Do you know him or not?
-Not personally.

18:42.075 --> 18:44.409
-Should have killed him
when we had the chance.

18:45.811 --> 18:47.824
You let him out of the room.

18:49.053 --> 18:50.791
You pitied him?

18:52.285 --> 18:53.805
'Cause if you did,
that is the first time

18:53.830 --> 18:55.525
you let the emotion
get the better of you.

18:55.550 --> 18:57.499
- It doesn't matter, he's dead.

18:57.576 --> 19:01.468
And you have your doctor.
-I know you were a soldier.

19:01.819 --> 19:04.095
An Officer. I guessed it.

19:05.962 --> 19:09.032
It must be hard aiming
down and shooting at someone.

19:09.537 --> 19:11.275
-Npt infected, I mean.

19:13.213 --> 19:15.347
On second thought,
he said he was.

19:16.350 --> 19:20.146
Do you understand what he meant by that?
 -Forget it! He's dead!

19:20.672 --> 19:24.999
-And you better stop
asking questions before you expose more

19:25.024 --> 19:27.793
details to two
complete strangers.

19:28.159 --> 19:30.549
-So, You're a doctor,

19:30.574 --> 19:33.570
I'm sure you understand these
things better than us.

19:33.595 --> 19:35.120
What do you think he meant

19:35.528 --> 19:37.597
that he is not infected?

19:38.194 --> 19:41.214
I mean, someone who's
 infected person turns into...

19:42.372 --> 19:46.460
I mean you know, how can he be infected
and still control himself?

19:47.514 --> 19:49.625
It has an incubation period.

19:50.607 --> 19:51.620
Ok.

19:52.785 --> 19:55.254
How dis he get
 infected in the first place?

19:56.174 --> 19:58.452
He had to be infected by one of them.
I mean

19:58.477 --> 20:02.894
those wounds didn't look deep
enough to be animal bites.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.861
You'd think that...
-Let it go.

20:06.593 --> 20:10.815
There'll be time enough for your questions
-Must be almost nine o'clock.

20:12.065 --> 20:13.900
If you turn the radio to...

20:13.925 --> 20:17.459
- That's right. We almost
forgot it's almost nine.

20:17.536 --> 20:21.097
You listen to him too? -Yeah, of course.
Every day at nine.

20:21.398 --> 20:25.218
Do you think that it's him talking
or a recording? -I do not know.

20:25.645 --> 20:27.481
Someone broadcasted it.

20:27.506 --> 20:31.177
-Must be...Manually
operated radio broadcast

20:31.254 --> 20:33.930
or a pre recorded program
that comes on every day at nine.

20:33.955 --> 20:36.737
-Hey, you are worrying me.

20:37.640 --> 20:40.659
I'm supposed to be the
cynical one, the skeptic.

20:40.836 --> 20:46.015
But not without feelings. You're the son of
 a bitch, remember? The purposeful one?

20:46.375 --> 20:49.294
Who Lacks emotion, stays on the move and...

20:49.395 --> 20:52.413
-Come on, let's go,
it's probably already started.

20:57.851 --> 21:04.099
Perhaps it came with the rodents.
Small, elusive, merciless.

21:04.801 --> 21:07.541
Spreading disease and death.

21:07.642 --> 21:13.505
At times eating the remnants of the strong,
other times preying the weak.

21:14.330 --> 21:16.847
They're merging from
the dens of night,

21:16.872 --> 21:18.695
it's raiding dinosaur nests.

21:19.568 --> 21:25.336
devouring their eggs, systematically
destroying the mighty creatures.

21:26.593 --> 21:29.686
Perhaps that's the
nature of progress,

21:30.290 --> 21:31.802
the new devouring the old.

21:32.335 --> 21:36.163
Tears him to thousands
of tiny pieces until it perishes.

21:37.768 --> 21:42.934
Perhaps progress is in it's
essence a type of extinction.

21:43.601 --> 21:49.091
Unavoidable like the time in
death, but accompanying it.

21:50.750 --> 21:55.450
The second day
And God called the firmament Heaven

22:18.792 --> 22:21.342
-Step into my office.

22:32.059 --> 22:35.081
-Remind me what are
 we doing here exactly.

22:35.629 --> 22:38.673
-We are setting up
 traps for the kill zones.

22:39.023 --> 22:43.419
Then there lure
infected and we butcher them.

22:44.525 --> 22:46.372
I know it sounds
absurd at first.

22:46.397 --> 22:48.347
Our initial instinct is
to entrench ourselves

22:48.372 --> 22:53.166
 in one spot. Or if you do not want to get
trapped, simply run away

22:53.191 --> 22:58.035
or stay out of trouble. But...
-No, I mean, I get that part.

22:58.136 --> 23:02.005
We're in charge, we
chase them, not the other way around,

23:02.557 --> 23:08.519
what I mean is what are we doing here
with all of this water and...

23:10.187 --> 23:14.707
Electrodes? -Electrodes. Well, we are

23:16.759 --> 23:21.343
dividing the waters from the waters
and making a firmament

23:21.444 --> 23:24.194
That we will call heaven.

23:26.526 --> 23:30.250
It's...it's electrolysis. It's
breaking down water

23:30.275 --> 23:32.475
into hydrogen and oxygen.

23:32.644 --> 23:34.492
I'm hoping to create
a large enough amount

23:34.517 --> 23:37.276
of hydrogen in a closed space

23:37.386 --> 23:42.144
so that at any given
moment only a small spark and...

23:42.345 --> 23:46.083
everything explodes. Everything.
In theory, of course.

23:46.184 --> 23:49.892
Truth is, I've tried several times
and it didn't go so well...I guess I

23:49.993 --> 23:51.877
couldn't create a large enough

23:51.902 --> 23:54.414
amount of hydrogen
in the closed space

23:54.491 --> 23:55.998
to get a substantial blast.

23:56.023 --> 23:59.428
I don't know, maybe I didn't
seal the spaces well enough...

23:59.505 --> 24:04.080
or maybe I haven't had enough
containers with electrodes, but...

24:05.488 --> 24:09.054
Whatever the reason,
we're doing it now.

24:10.428 --> 24:12.560
-It's beautiful.

24:14.196 --> 24:18.987
-Thanks. I'm glad  someone
appreciates my originality.

24:19.012 --> 24:23.928
Not him, though. TNT and gunpowder,
it's all it cares about.

24:24.029 --> 24:28.558
I mean the metaphor. It's like God.

24:28.659 --> 24:32.017
Turning water into the heavens.
-That?

24:33.054 --> 24:35.570
That's not original.
This religious fanatic

24:35.595 --> 24:36.967
joined one of the forums

24:37.044 --> 24:41.033
I've managed once. Some scientist
or pseudo scientist. I don't know.

24:41.215 --> 24:45.292
The kind that tries to explain
 the scriptures through science? You know?

24:45.493 --> 24:51.303
Anyways, he raised the  theory that this
is how God created the heavens.

24:51.604 --> 24:56.585
By transmitting an electric current through
the prehistoric waters.

24:56.686 --> 25:00.542
It's a good theory, but I
didn't let him off that easy.

25:00.643 --> 25:03.616
I asked him "Hey, where
did the nitrogen and the air come from"?

25:05.020 --> 25:07.075
Still waiting for an answer.

25:07.100 --> 25:11.970
-Where the nitrogen came from or
how the heavens were created?

25:15.024 --> 25:16.743
-Yeah.

26:12.294 --> 26:13.933
-Do you like it?

26:15.110 --> 26:16.713
-What's it for?

26:18.895 --> 26:20.827
-You sound just like my father.

26:23.598 --> 26:26.162
Why does everything have
 to have a purpose?

26:27.760 --> 26:30.502
Why can't we do things
just for the sake of doing them?

26:32.875 --> 26:35.275
Do you like it or not?

26:36.079 --> 26:41.237
-Aesthetically yes, but...
-But it serves no purpose, right?

26:41.977 --> 26:46.485
-Say, don't you think beauty
has a purpose of its own?

26:46.970 --> 26:52.477
That it can exist just for
 the sake of...well... beauty?

26:53.187 --> 26:56.200
Can't we do things for no reason at all?

26:56.487 --> 26:59.814
Say, eat something
because it tastes good

27:01.756 --> 27:07.311
or hear music?
Or draw a picture just for fun?

27:15.320 --> 27:20.374
Alright, If you're done, let's go
and watch you learn about the rifle.

27:26.804 --> 27:30.544
I can't believe you.
You're just like him.

27:31.122 --> 27:33.920
Purpose, purpose, purpose.

27:34.759 --> 27:39.104
There can be beauty
in purpose and function too, you know?

27:39.968 --> 27:44.338
I mean, look how...
-They are entering fucking building!

27:44.536 --> 27:46.539
Follow me.

27:55.882 --> 27:57.904
Go, go, go.

28:01.626 --> 28:04.577
One entry, weapons that way.

28:05.766 --> 28:07.168
We need to leave!

28:07.193 --> 28:11.397
-Negative. Outside they can close
in on us from all directions.

28:11.473 --> 28:13.118
Here, there's only
two directions.

28:13.143 --> 28:15.256
And according to you the
rescue’s on the way.

28:15.333 --> 28:18.552
As soon as it arrives, we'll make
a run for it and get out of here.

28:23.494 --> 28:25.582
Grenada.

28:38.464 --> 28:40.866
The rescue's here! Move!

29:26.912 --> 29:28.948
-Get in!

29:43.518 --> 29:45.524
-Go, go!

30:13.546 --> 30:17.575
This is the second time they'd attacked
us instead of us waiting for them.

30:17.600 --> 30:18.942
Something is not right.

30:19.119 --> 30:22.868
-It doesn't mean anything's wrong, either.
What is wrong is for

30:22.969 --> 30:26.818
The third time we've been attacked
from the direction you've been observing.

30:26.919 --> 30:29.389
And instead of working
on her SHOOTING skills,

30:29.414 --> 30:31.042
you're playing the alchemists.

30:52.688 --> 30:56.800
You still owe mean answer.
-I answered you.

30:56.901 --> 31:00.591
From what I've seen with my own eyes.
the time between an infection and

31:00.692 --> 31:04.282
outbreak shifts from a
few seconds to several minutes.

31:04.460 --> 31:06.951
But I've only seen a few cases,
so I can only go by that.

31:06.976 --> 31:08.864
-It's the same as I've
seen up until now.

31:08.941 --> 31:13.120
And that's what I read in the official
reports before everything fell apart.

31:13.227 --> 31:14.742
But that guy at the hospital...

31:14.767 --> 31:17.601
- We have no reason to believe
he was actually infected.

31:17.678 --> 31:22.025
-I don't know. It's hard to explain,
 but I feel like he wasn't lying.

31:22.126 --> 31:23.543
We don't know what this thing is

31:23.568 --> 31:26.554
and we don't know how it's transmitted
from one person to another,

31:26.579 --> 31:28.305
and we don't know
who and what he is.

31:28.843 --> 31:32.960
In any case, I'm not the right person
for this discussion.

31:33.061 --> 31:37.277
As far as I'm concerned, it's over.
But if you insist, you got him.

31:37.989 --> 31:42.267
Now, if you do not mind,
I have more important matters to attend to.

32:44.333 --> 32:45.622
Take a quick break.

32:45.647 --> 32:48.359
Drink some water,
straight back.

32:57.887 --> 33:02.202
-Purpose, purpose, purpose.
I swear you he's just like dad.

33:03.075 --> 33:07.504
-You're right, but he's not.
Don't fall into that trap.

34:05.699 --> 34:07.166
-Are you sure it's not too soon?

34:07.191 --> 34:09.074
You fired more weapons
on the range than most

34:09.099 --> 34:10.996
recruits on do during
weeks of basic training.

34:11.875 --> 34:13.992
The sooner you get
used to killing,

34:14.016 --> 34:16.119
the sooner that we'll get
this thing over with.

34:16.871 --> 34:21.609
-How long will this have to go on?
How long do we have to make traps and

34:21.710 --> 34:26.547
wait around with guns and kill?
 -Just a few more months, sweetheart.

34:26.648 --> 34:28.915
I promise, in a few
months this nightmare will be over.

34:28.940 --> 34:31.311
 And we'll find
a quiet spot where we can put all these

34:31.418 --> 34:35.944
horrible things behind us. Ok?
-We almost always make traps.

34:36.027 --> 34:39.864
Stand by with weapons, wait.
It's never really over.

34:39.889 --> 34:44.206
There are merely rest nights, that's all.
-You don't really believe that?

34:44.804 --> 34:49.192
That's a strange way of looking
 at things: through a rifle sight,

34:49.293 --> 34:52.554
with no hope for
 something better? Something else?

34:56.527 --> 34:59.512
-It worked! The vapor bomb; it worked!

35:00.675 --> 35:03.020
You should have seen it.

35:03.850 --> 35:06.775
The moment we went up we were
bombarded with cloud of steam.

35:06.800 --> 35:08.142
They were totally blinded!

35:08.219 --> 35:10.862
You should have seen it. All
water turned into steam

35:10.887 --> 35:12.941
inside the container and...
-A few charges would have

35:12.966 --> 35:16.437
done the job. Probably even better.
-Then maybe that's how the heavens

35:16.538 --> 35:20.715
were created. A huge heat
source boiled the water...

35:20.816 --> 35:25.726
But it's only steam. -OK, Ok, Ok.
If the temperature high enough,

35:25.827 --> 35:30.147
and AI mean really high, the water
disintegrates into it's elements, but...

35:30.248 --> 35:34.072
-But now the chemistry lesson is over
and we have real work to do!

35:37.946 --> 35:39.348
-Are there any more?

36:19.457 --> 36:22.277
-It is possible they
killed each other.

36:23.157 --> 36:27.336
The predatory dinosaurs simply
disobeyed the laws of balance.

36:28.506 --> 36:30.002
Just like man.

36:31.653 --> 36:35.695
Perhaps one or several dinosaurs
 become so skilled at killing

36:36.109 --> 36:40.050
 that they eradicated entire species.

36:41.799 --> 36:44.766
I know it doesn't sound likely,
after all, the ecosystem

36:44.867 --> 36:48.371
was supposed to intervene.

36:48.941 --> 36:51.617
The more the population
of prey decreases,

36:51.642 --> 36:54.193
the smaller the
populations of predators

36:54.270 --> 36:59.597
becomes. Allowing prey
to recover, and so forth.

37:00.503 --> 37:05.513
The only exception into
 this equation is man.

37:06.250 --> 37:11.533
But how do we know
 man is the only one?

37:13.133 --> 37:19.855
-The third day
God called the dry land Earth

37:26.418 --> 37:30.500
-Before all of this began,
I used to watched these scenes for hours

37:32.927 --> 37:34.485
to observe the basic power

37:34.510 --> 37:36.833
of the creation of
matter from nothing.

37:39.506 --> 37:41.553
There is no greater truth than that.

37:48.532 --> 37:49.824
-We're out of here.

38:29.262 --> 38:30.330
-Did you pick anything up

38:30.355 --> 38:32.330
since everything went quiet?
-No.

38:33.891 --> 38:36.322
Just the guy with
the dinosaurs, that's it.

38:38.716 --> 38:40.775
Do you think there is still
a government out there?

38:41.275 --> 38:42.702
-There Is always something.

38:43.049 --> 38:45.569
That's what civilization
is all about, isn't it?

38:46.580 --> 38:48.426
Someone tells others what to do,

38:48.492 --> 38:53.837
gives them orders and in return,
lives at their expense. It's false.

38:53.911 --> 38:56.648
-And by your definition, if
there is no government,

38:56.673 --> 38:58.181
then there is no civilization.

38:59.546 --> 39:03.583
-I don't know. If there were a
functioning government,

39:04.480 --> 39:07.125
they'd probably cleanse the entire area
with nuclear weapons.

39:08.768 --> 39:13.803
and we wouldn't be here.
And maybe it'll still happen. Who knows?

39:14.692 --> 39:17.302
-Well, in that case, we won't
know anything until it's over.

39:17.327 --> 39:19.696
-Oh, that all depends.

39:19.826 --> 39:22.909
If their ICBM's are a cruise
missiles, you won't hear a thing.

39:23.224 --> 39:27.161
But if they're airplanes,
then you have two options.

39:27.534 --> 39:30.704
subsonic bombers like
the B-52s and you might

39:30.729 --> 39:33.034
just hear the jet
airplanes approaching

39:33.059 --> 39:37.701
right before the blast. Or
supersonic bomber like the B-1

39:37.726 --> 39:40.408
and then you will not hear
anything because well,

39:40.484 --> 39:43.825
they're supersonic. But you
might just hear a sonic

39:43.850 --> 39:47.172
boom right before it all
comes crashing down.

39:47.535 --> 39:51.234
And there'll be this
bright light and this intense heat

39:52.254 --> 39:54.017
And then you won't  hear a thing.

39:56.944 --> 39:58.003
-You're smiling.

39:58.028 --> 40:00.872
This is the first time
I see you smiling.

40:00.897 --> 40:05.394
Finally,  someone else he can
drive crazy  with this conspiracy theories.

40:05.807 --> 40:09.655
Did you tell her what you
did before all this began? -No.

40:10.112 --> 40:13.460
-He had a website where
he refuted conspiracy theories.

40:13.485 --> 40:17.671
Now he's the  greatest believer of all.
-occam's razor.

40:17.696 --> 40:19.609
It's usually the most simple,

40:19.634 --> 40:22.931
most logical explanation of all.
Think about it.

40:23.449 --> 40:27.265
Why did all the functioning
governments disappear all of a sudden?

40:28.474 --> 40:30.580
Why is there still electricity
and running water?

40:31.199 --> 40:36.290
You tell me. It must be
biological weapons.

40:38.567 --> 40:40.204
I believe that.

40:40.229 --> 40:44.144
It's the most logical,
most simple explanation.

40:44.573 --> 40:46.426
Your turn to stand guard.

41:04.903 --> 41:08.766
-What did you lose?
-More Than enough.

41:09.351 --> 41:14.134
You?
 -I was on the offensive.

41:15.399 --> 41:19.027
You never sit back and
rest?-Always.

41:19.721 --> 41:20.760
It's all right.

41:20.785 --> 41:23.428
I understand if you don't
want to talk about it.

41:26.811 --> 41:29.828
-Everybody.
Everything.

41:31.543 --> 41:33.287
As bad as it gets.

41:34.762 --> 41:38.761
-Husband? Parents? Kids?

41:41.044 --> 41:45.100
-Cousins, uncles...
As I said,

41:46.130 --> 41:47.706
The worst.

41:49.921 --> 41:51.793
-It's always gonna be worse.

41:53.645 --> 41:57.787
-I see. Look, I know
everything looks dark,

41:58.655 --> 42:01.697
I understand your point of
view, but things change.

42:01.929 --> 42:03.162
-Not for me!

42:04.730 --> 42:08.215
Most of my life I have killed
and witnessed killing.

42:09.233 --> 42:10.528
I have been responsible for the

42:10.553 --> 42:12.728
planning and development
of ways and

42:12.753 --> 42:14.428
methods of destruction
that will be

42:14.453 --> 42:16.558
incomprehensible to
a person like you.

42:17.436 --> 42:21.062
So, as far as I'm concerned,
nothing's changed!

42:21.439 --> 42:23.554
-But surely not like this.

42:23.579 --> 42:27.320
Not women and children.
Not your own family.

42:29.394 --> 42:33.928
Look, my entire life
I've seen people

42:33.953 --> 42:36.585
die suffering from all
sorts of illnesses.

42:36.662 --> 42:39.858
But at the same time, I've
seen others who healed

42:39.883 --> 42:42.491
and grew as people because
of that suffering.

42:43.191 --> 42:47.218
So you're right. Nothing's changed.

42:47.550 --> 42:52.474
That's exactly my point.
I know that even now there is hope.

43:04.187 --> 43:07.149
-We shot four of the five who were
in pursuit but there is still more.

43:07.174 --> 43:09.290
-This is the third time.
This is not an accident,

43:09.315 --> 43:10.560
someone's leading them to us.

43:10.585 --> 43:12.457
 -Tonight's hideout. Move!

45:05.245 --> 45:08.057
-I'm beginning to think that it's
that the guy from the hospital.

45:09.825 --> 45:12.678
After all, he survived
all of our traps.

45:12.986 --> 45:16.511
And he said something
 about them not seeing him.

45:17.324 --> 45:19.419
Could be they're not
attacking him for some reason,

45:19.444 --> 45:21.261
 just like they
don't attack one another.

45:22.336 --> 45:23.591
What do you think?

45:23.616 --> 45:27.116
-He could be guiding them to
us and then running away.

45:27.743 --> 45:29.202
It is not unlikely.

45:30.594 --> 45:34.984
Devise a plan. If he really
is leading the infected to us,

45:36.106 --> 45:38.077
we'll have to neutralize him.

46:11.075 --> 46:13.460
It's eleven o'clock and
we missed the broadcast.

46:14.617 --> 46:17.200
It's the first time I'm
 missing the broadcast.

46:31.991 --> 46:35.293
So, you think they do know each other?
-I do not know.

46:35.724 --> 46:37.392
It's not so clear cut.

46:37.503 --> 46:39.260
-You said for a fact
that he should have

46:39.285 --> 46:41.230
killed them at the
hospital, but he didn't.

46:41.641 --> 46:42.772
That's not like him.

46:43.250 --> 46:46.169
I mean, I don't know him very well,
but that's not like him at all.

46:46.264 --> 46:48.498
-I know, I've never seen
him hesitate like that.

46:50.527 --> 46:53.622
But then again, I've never seen
him with a live person before.

46:53.676 --> 46:55.078
I mean a healthy person.

46:56.277 --> 46:57.853
I mean, not infected.

46:58.584 --> 47:00.910
Look, he's obviously a
professional soldier.

47:01.604 --> 47:06.470
Could be that shooting citizens in
back is just against his basic nature.

47:06.721 --> 47:09.545
You know, the ethos of the
honorable warrior and all that.

47:10.387 --> 47:12.557
It actually it fits in
well with his type.

47:12.582 --> 47:14.699
I've got to say
that that's exactly

47:14.724 --> 47:17.309
what I assumed when
I first met him.

47:17.336 --> 47:21.147
Way too young to be
General, too confident and

47:21.152 --> 47:26.493
experienced to be Major
or captain. I don't know.

47:28.269 --> 47:30.114
But we should probably
get back to the others.

47:30.140 --> 47:32.324
they're probably beefing
up security as we speak.

47:32.586 --> 47:36.085
If someone really is leading
the infected to us,

47:37.360 --> 47:38.533
we should probably set up

47:38.558 --> 47:41.915
as many charges as we can.
We are out of hiding places.

48:44.969 --> 48:47.221
-What is this?
-it's a little

48:47.245 --> 48:49.271
experiment I'm conducting.

48:50.142 --> 48:51.838
I'm creating land from water.

48:52.832 --> 48:55.857
See, the cage is
in a body of water

48:55.884 --> 48:57.952
and I'm running a fake
current through it.

48:58.274 --> 48:59.818
The current makes the particles

48:59.843 --> 49:01.685
inside the water
stick to the cage.

49:01.811 --> 49:05.853
According to the theory, enough particles
should stick to it

49:05.878 --> 49:11.078
over time to create
small islands where you see the cage.

49:20.945 --> 49:24.251
-We should probably go back.
-Yeah.

49:26.026 --> 49:28.365
Yes, we should. -This
Is really nice.

49:28.390 --> 49:29.432
Thanks, thanks.

49:44.529 --> 49:47.496
If he's really following us,
he's familiar with this place.

49:49.017 --> 49:52.196
That means he'll will guiding
 the infected to us tonight or tomorrow.

49:52.871 --> 49:56.836
Do you have a plan?
-I always have a plan.

49:57.290 --> 49:58.954
-That's how you put
 up with me, isn't it?

50:00.302 --> 50:02.448
Maybe you enjoy me driving you crazy.

52:01.651 --> 52:04.915
I should have
known. Like always,

52:05.399 --> 52:09.247
you are hunting me down. Like
a cat playing with a mouse!

52:09.269 --> 52:11.044
-Don't move. Don't move.

52:13.442 --> 52:18.204
I get it now. They think they
should be afraid of me.

52:19.472 --> 52:22.259
Hate me. Me!

52:23.048 --> 52:25.520
He's the one you
should be afraid of!

52:25.545 --> 52:28.342
He's the one who killed
his entire family!

52:29.938 --> 52:33.498
Tell them, Colonel.
Tell them who you really are!

52:33.523 --> 52:36.560
Don't move! -I suggest you stand
still and raise your hands.

52:36.560 --> 52:38.264
-All of them!

52:38.806 --> 52:42.744
With his own gun! From point blank!

52:43.526 --> 52:47.428
His mother, his children,

52:48.274 --> 52:51.535
his little niece.
A two-year old baby.

52:52.624 --> 52:55.985
Clever. They absolutely aren't.

52:56.810 --> 53:02.056
You kill one person as a civilian ,
you're a criminal. A murderer.

53:02.750 --> 53:07.818
You kill one person while
wear a uniform and you're a hero.

53:08.554 --> 53:12.589
A civilian killing twenty
 is a psychopath.

53:13.158 --> 53:14.726
A serial killer.

53:16.129 --> 53:20.076
-But a soldier, he gets a medal!
-Stop it!

53:20.646 --> 53:22.623
-And if by any chance
you're responsible

53:22.648 --> 53:26.879
for the deaths of hundreds
or thousands or more,

53:27.134 --> 53:32.660
You're a national hero.
Kill millions you're a god.

53:33.192 --> 53:37.847
There are poems about you!
You've become the stuff of legends!

53:37.948 --> 53:41.875
Stop, I beg you.
-They are afraid of me.

53:43.623 --> 53:45.473
They despise me.

53:46.142 --> 53:49.749
When all this began, he still had
soldiers under him.

53:50.504 --> 53:53.588
He could have helped
 his family to solitary,

53:54.331 --> 53:57.341
take care of them. Help them out!

53:58.047 --> 54:01.015
At most send one of his troops
to take them out of their misery!

54:01.109 --> 54:06.519
But no, no! not him! he went by himself!

54:06.833 --> 54:10.186
To put a bullet in each
and every one of them.

54:10.211 --> 54:11.792
Right in the head.

54:12.089 --> 54:16.178
execution style. So here he is!

54:17.247 --> 54:22.132
A decorated hero!
A noble man of honor!

54:23.037 --> 54:24.760
Nothing but a psychopath

54:24.785 --> 54:27.799
in the service of the law!
Nothing more!

54:28.915 --> 54:33.937
His mother, his children!
From point blank!

54:35.439 --> 54:40.592
Tell them, Colonel. How does it
feel murdering your whole family?

54:42.038 --> 54:44.802
-No! What the fuck ?!

54:47.762 --> 54:51.217
You could have waited a little longer,
it looked like he had information.

54:53.220 --> 54:54.698
You could have waited.

54:56.594 --> 55:00.775
-I've seen it before.
He was about to die.

55:02.708 --> 55:03.915
And you?

55:05.524 --> 55:07.261
Did you know him or not?

55:07.286 --> 55:11.049
Why'd hesitate again instead
of just killing him?

55:12.122 --> 55:16.855
Why'd you hesitate this time?
-What's the difference?

55:17.563 --> 55:18.792
He's dead.

55:22.998 --> 55:25.287
Another attack.
Take up your positions!

58:52.052 --> 58:54.336
-A meteor, yes.

58:55.847 --> 59:01.186
After all, what can cause such
sudden extinction other than some

59:01.212 --> 59:06.737
external element coming out of
 nowhere obliterating everything?

59:07.971 --> 59:11.875
Like a Hollywood disaster
movie or an apocalyptic myth.

59:15.035 --> 59:19.246
Or is it no more than a reflection of one
of our greatest fears?

59:19.271 --> 59:22.090
The total lack of control
over our fate?

59:23.305 --> 59:26.092
Who knows that whatever we do

59:26.117 --> 59:30.152
at any given moment,
the end is lurking.

59:31.311 --> 59:35.964
Absolute and final gigantic,
burning, unstoppable.

59:36.165 --> 59:39.570
Of course, there is the
possibility they did see it,

59:40.500 --> 59:43.731
but simply never
understand what it was.

59:46.720 --> 59:50.261
Perhaps it's before our
 own eyes as we speak, and

59:50.265 --> 59:53.393
like the dinosaurs we can't
 see or hear it.

59:54.103 --> 59:59.570
Like an annoying beep that your brain
simply wipes off after a while.

01:00:01.778 --> 01:00:04.006
-The fifth day. And God created

01:00:04.031 --> 01:00:06.669
great whales, and every
living creature that moveth.

01:00:45.324 --> 01:00:48.785
-So,did you know him or not?

01:00:49.894 --> 01:00:52.245
-When I told you to
prepare the hideout, I

01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:54.689
asked you to kill the
fish in the aquarium.

01:00:54.751 --> 01:00:57.886
They attract cats, and if they die
they will attract worse than that.

01:01:02.425 --> 01:01:06.760
-You didn't answer my question.
-The time and energy you spent on that

01:01:06.861 --> 01:01:10.792
 automatic nourishing device,
we don't have time for that.

01:01:12.226 --> 01:01:18.024
-Did you know him or not?
-I told you; I didn't know him personally

01:01:18.029 --> 01:01:22.300
and he is dead. So it doesn't matter.
-And the truth doesn't matter?

01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:30.022
You're hiding something from us.

01:01:31.152 --> 01:01:35.294
You know how all this
started, how it all began, You know...

01:01:36.262 --> 01:01:39.309
You know how all of this is started...
-What difference does it make?

01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:42.002
What I told you or didn’t
tell you is nothing

01:01:42.027 --> 01:01:44.387
you couldn't have figured
out for yourself.

01:01:44.643 --> 01:01:47.770
Yes, it was biological
weapons experiment.

01:01:47.795 --> 01:01:49.516
Yes it got out of hand.
Yes.

01:01:50.174 --> 01:01:55.355
-So you knew. This entire time
you knew and you didn't tell us?

01:01:56.137 --> 01:01:58.725
You knew how all
this happened and...

01:01:58.750 --> 01:02:00.588
-in the same way you knew.

01:02:01.323 --> 01:02:03.933
I don't understand why
you're feigning innocence.

01:02:03.958 --> 01:02:05.468
Didn't you ever stop to think

01:02:05.493 --> 01:02:09.543
why the infected don't attack one another?
Why they only attack the healthy?

01:02:09.915 --> 01:02:12.135
You ? With all the
conspiracy theories?

01:02:13.304 --> 01:02:15.423
Wasn't it obvious to
you from the start

01:02:15.448 --> 01:02:17.248
that the most
logical explanation

01:02:17.325 --> 01:02:20.580
Is a biological weapons
experiment that got out of hand?

01:02:21.481 --> 01:02:22.846
I mean, what would it achieve,

01:02:22.871 --> 01:02:24.761
for me to tell you something
you already knew?

01:02:25.768 --> 01:02:27.164
She's a scientist.

01:02:28.638 --> 01:02:32.046
It's your obsessive curiosity
that got us here in the first place.

01:02:32.824 --> 01:02:36.932
If it wasn't for the geeky obsessions
of people like you with the truth, and how

01:02:37.033 --> 01:02:38.782
and the why, we wouldn't
be here right now.

01:02:38.802 --> 01:02:40.778
-Look, I understand
your anger, but...

01:02:40.856 --> 01:02:44.753
Just like he sat at his computer
developing software viruses.

01:02:44.778 --> 01:02:47.376
His friends and colleagues
were developing things

01:02:47.401 --> 01:02:48.831
that were much, much worse.

01:02:48.856 --> 01:02:53.019
And he could easily be one of them.
If you care so much about the truth,

01:02:53.044 --> 01:02:58.052
don't lie to yourself. We're all sons
of bitches, that's the truth.

01:02:58.531 --> 01:03:01.110
So don't play innocent
as you didn't know,

01:03:01.135 --> 01:03:03.824
just because I hid or didn't hide
something from you.

01:03:06.655 --> 01:03:09.395
I don't have time for
this ridiculous discussion.

01:03:10.037 --> 01:03:11.403
We have a large explosives

01:03:11.428 --> 01:03:14.105
arena to prepare by noon.
In the last few days,

01:03:14.182 --> 01:03:17.011
we've burned our traps faster
than we could build them.

01:03:17.036 --> 01:03:18.349
We have to close the gap.

01:03:18.626 --> 01:03:21.575
Now, don't fool yourselves.
It won't get any better.

01:03:21.759 --> 01:03:25.028
The infected are getting more
and more violent and aggressive.

01:03:25.053 --> 01:03:26.968
If we stop dictating
the time and place,

01:03:26.992 --> 01:03:30.291
they're gonna kill us all.
now get some rest.

01:03:32.716 --> 01:03:34.828
We'll take lower floors
when we are rested.

01:03:47.290 --> 01:03:49.037
Don't judge him too harshly.

01:03:51.974 --> 01:03:53.785
You heard what happened.

01:03:57.204 --> 01:03:59.815
He had to kill his
own family by himself.

01:04:01.941 --> 01:04:04.185
You didn't just lost everything.

01:04:07.769 --> 01:04:11.556
I used to have this argument
 with my father about euthanasia.

01:04:15.063 --> 01:04:19.500
Would I have the courage to do it?
If and when?

01:04:19.617 --> 01:04:24.839
-Don't fall into that trap.
He's not Dad, remember?

01:04:31.107 --> 01:04:32.246
-Let's go.

01:05:39.449 --> 01:05:41.175
-Tadpoles?

01:05:44.350 --> 01:05:47.456
It's amazing, even the frogs
will fuck and spawn here/

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:50.759
-Hey, hey, hey
mate and procreate, please.

01:05:52.078 --> 01:05:56.296
-So you're saying if we find
some random fish

01:05:56.397 --> 01:05:58.213
from an abandoned pet store

01:05:58.238 --> 01:06:01.600
and put it together they'll
mate and procreate?

01:06:02.581 --> 01:06:04.821
-Absolutely. But we
really shouldn't because

01:06:04.845 --> 01:06:07.441
they tend to electrocute
the place,at some point.

01:06:08.462 --> 01:06:13.418
-Yeah, but...we will have a chance
to make some love before it's all over.

01:06:46.613 --> 01:06:49.229
-Now I understand why you do not like
talk about it.

01:06:51.686 --> 01:06:52.809
I'm sorry.

01:06:54.681 --> 01:06:57.950
Your wife, children?

01:07:00.044 --> 01:07:04.191
-Parents, siblings,
a niece, everything.

01:07:04.322 --> 01:07:10.015
Everyone. With my sidearm
at point-blank just like the man said.

01:07:11.291 --> 01:07:12.446
-The worst.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.276
I'm sorry.
-There is always something worse.

01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:26.033
I treated a terminal patient
once who applied fora court order to

01:07:26.134 --> 01:07:30.697
switch him off her life support machine.
You know, to allow her to die in dignity.

01:07:31.315 --> 01:07:33.480
When the order came in,
the woman insisted

01:07:33.505 --> 01:07:36.173
that only her youngest
daughter would actually do it

01:07:36.250 --> 01:07:38.994
You know, to actually
pull out the plug.

01:07:40.205 --> 01:07:42.657
That girl lived on
the other side of the world.

01:07:42.681 --> 01:07:44.866
It took him a whole
week to trace her

01:07:44.891 --> 01:07:47.075
and another week
to finally arrive.

01:07:48.497 --> 01:07:52.867
All through that time, the mother
suffered through hell.

01:07:54.324 --> 01:07:58.895
We begged her to end it,
but she insisted on waiting.

01:08:02.793 --> 01:08:06.184
After the girl arrived
and everything was over,

01:08:06.209 --> 01:08:08.906
I had a chance to
speak with her.

01:08:08.931 --> 01:08:14.626
When she spoke of her mother, she
spoke of a cold and harsh woman.

01:08:15.823 --> 01:08:18.859
Somebody who is always criticizing
 demanding.

01:08:20.219 --> 01:08:23.694
never caressing, accepting comforting.

01:08:25.828 --> 01:08:29.242
But she said she would forgiven
everything if her mother

01:08:29.267 --> 01:08:31.514
had just told her once
that she loved her.

01:08:33.863 --> 01:08:36.221
At that point I stopped
her and I said,

01:08:36.247 --> 01:08:38.698
"You mother didn't
just say she loved you,

01:08:38.723 --> 01:08:42.683
 she screamed it out loud
 halfway across the world."

01:10:20.874 --> 01:10:25.450
-Ten minute break then prepare
the charges we're not keeping up.

01:10:25.553 --> 01:10:27.699
This can't go on;
we must keep up.

01:10:56.207 --> 01:10:57.815
-I wish we were on the beach.

01:11:00.269 --> 01:11:03.278
-I'm not the beach type of guy.

01:11:04.414 --> 01:11:06.411
That's because you didn't
 know my dad.

01:11:07.702 --> 01:11:11.071
One week with him and you would
totally become sea god.

01:11:12.335 --> 01:11:18.148
He was really a pirate deep inside.
At least a professional fisherman.

01:11:20.338 --> 01:11:25.653
He always talked about a Viking
burial ceremony at sea. -Viking burial.

01:11:27.396 --> 01:11:31.166
So what? Lying in a boat,

01:11:31.696 --> 01:11:34.134
sailing off into
the horizon with

01:11:34.159 --> 01:11:37.246
all his favorite weapons
and worldly possessions?

01:11:40.233 --> 01:11:43.327
-And the fire slowly consuming it all.

01:11:45.406 --> 01:11:46.621
Not bad.

01:11:48.807 --> 01:11:51.668
-I don't know. I'd rather die
while making love.

01:12:02.788 --> 01:12:06.431
-Is this the first time you've scratched
or bitten by an infected person?

01:12:07.284 --> 01:12:08.383
-What do you mean?

01:12:08.623 --> 01:12:09.868
-You know what I mean.

01:12:09.892 --> 01:12:12.002
I'm talking about scratches
you got on the corridor.

01:12:13.516 --> 01:12:15.223
-You don't miss a trick, do you?

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:21.532
-Not when it comes to injuries.
That's what I do for a living, remember?

01:12:22.586 --> 01:12:24.300
And you didn't answer my question.

01:12:27.181 --> 01:12:30.796
-It's happened before.
-Yeah, to me, too.

01:12:31.359 --> 01:12:34.918
Right at the beginning, but then
then it wasn't contagious or

01:12:35.971 --> 01:12:37.643
it wasn't transmitted through bites

01:12:37.668 --> 01:12:41.697
or scratches. Or maybe the
incubation period was very long.

01:12:42.104 --> 01:12:43.796
Anyway, we have to find out.

01:12:43.821 --> 01:12:47.008
Maybe it's growing inside of us and
we must stay away from them

01:12:47.033 --> 01:12:51.688
for their  safety before
it breaks out while they're around us.

01:12:52.524 --> 01:12:56.039
-What makes you think I know ?
-Come on.

01:12:56.830 --> 01:13:00.159
There's no point in
carrying on the charade.

01:13:00.184 --> 01:13:01.954
It's alright, I won't tell them.

01:13:02.458 --> 01:13:05.639
-What do you mean?
-You know exactly what I mean.

01:13:05.663 --> 01:13:08.096
It can't be a coincidence.

01:13:16.962 --> 01:13:21.358
That's all right. I know
exactly how you feel.

01:13:23.974 --> 01:13:26.227
Everything is collapsing around me, too.

01:13:29.164 --> 01:13:34.274
All this is new to me. unlike
anything I've seen and maybe...

01:13:34.707 --> 01:13:38.005
-Maybe you need to
get a grip. Because like I said,

01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:41.028
As far as I'm concerned,
nothing's changed.

01:13:41.053 --> 01:13:42.756
-You're doing it again.

01:13:43.393 --> 01:13:47.430
Attacking instead of answering.
and  I refuse to play the game.

01:13:48.155 --> 01:13:52.578
I know some things haven't changed,
you're right, but there are wounds.

01:13:52.603 --> 01:13:56.652
-There are wounds that no one
can heal. Not a doctor,

01:13:56.696 --> 01:14:00.086
Not a healer, not time, no one.

01:14:06.684 --> 01:14:09.513
We've rested
enough ; we're leaving.

01:14:18.515 --> 01:14:20.308
-Promise me?

01:14:26.118 --> 01:14:29.453
Promise me that when all this is over
We can...

01:14:30.595 --> 01:14:33.959
try to grow some fish without
having to electrocute them?

01:14:37.406 --> 01:14:40.182
-And...tridents

01:14:40.963 --> 01:14:44.102
... and salamanders.

01:14:45.748 --> 01:14:48.146
and... -Frogs?

01:14:48.171 --> 01:14:50.054
Frogs.

01:14:51.187 --> 01:14:52.583
-Anything you want.

01:14:56.427 --> 01:15:00.908
-Come on, start making the charges.
Use them.We already know how

01:15:00.933 --> 01:15:01.727
to use use small arms.

01:15:01.752 --> 01:15:03.685
It's time you learn how
 to prepare charges and

01:15:03.710 --> 01:15:04.985
handle the explosives.

01:16:14.151 --> 01:16:17.905
-Another answer is
volcanic eruptions.

01:16:18.657 --> 01:16:22.943
Not a single event
but thousands of small ones.

01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:29.226
pressure accumulated from millions of years
and then one day, everything is released.

01:16:30.194 --> 01:16:35.347
The huge force erupts in numerous places,
filling the atmosphere with

01:16:35.372 --> 01:16:38.033
dust and lethal gases.
Blocking the sun,

01:16:38.058 --> 01:16:42.079
poisoning the soil,
the air and the water.

01:16:42.908 --> 01:16:47.497
What's more frightening than the thought of
destruction lurking under our feet?

01:16:47.873 --> 01:16:50.264
Coming from the same
the place we live off.

01:16:50.289 --> 01:16:56.584
From which we draw our comfort
in life and death?

01:17:18.594 --> 01:17:21.389
-I did it. It worked!
I've been trying

01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:23.640
this for months; it's perfect!

01:17:23.711 --> 01:17:27.063
Even he can say it's ineffective.
I mean, look. It's...it's small,

01:17:27.088 --> 01:17:30.439
It's got a remote control,
it's got a camera.

01:17:30.464 --> 01:17:32.490
it's the perfect patrol device.
It's perfect.

01:17:32.567 --> 01:17:36.560
-Nothing you can't do with a camera
installed in a remote controlled vehicle.

01:17:37.072 --> 01:17:41.376
-I knew you'd say that, but mind
can climb and descend stairs. Take a look.

01:17:41.635 --> 01:17:42.939
Check it out.

01:17:49.169 --> 01:17:52.917
I don't get it, it just worked.
-Don't worry, don't give up.

01:17:53.329 --> 01:17:55.325
You know, one of my
professor of medicine

01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:58.019
used to joke and say that
in the book of Genesis

01:17:58.044 --> 01:18:00.344
There's actually two versions
creation of man.

01:18:00.369 --> 01:18:04.728
Because you know, the first one didn't
work out so well, so God tried again.

01:18:04.982 --> 01:18:07.882
-Well, from what I can see, He didn't
do a better job the second time.

01:18:08.143 --> 01:18:12.163
I guess he released the beta version
too early before fixing all the bugs.

01:18:13.135 --> 01:18:16.205
-The beta version?
-Yeah, the beta version.

01:18:16.898 --> 01:18:19.713
You know, like
computer programs;

01:18:19.738 --> 01:18:23.521
they release versions
without fixing mistakes.

01:18:23.546 --> 01:18:26.101
-By no means whatsoever.
I see he managed

01:18:26.126 --> 01:18:28.872
to convince you, but
believe me, it's too soon.

01:18:29.348 --> 01:18:32.740
in a few weeks maybe, when we
are certain everyone's dead, but not now.

01:18:37.861 --> 01:18:42.125
-We talked about loading up several
tons of equipment and foods on trucks

01:18:42.499 --> 01:18:46.793
And drive them down to a remote
location in the desert. Somewhere isolated.

01:18:47.018 --> 01:18:51.580
Hundreds of kilometers away from
any town and to laying low for a while.

01:18:52.553 --> 01:18:58.645
-I'm all for it. I mean, look,
I devised a plan and I even made a list

01:18:58.746 --> 01:19:02.132
on how to collect everything.
And there's also room.

01:19:02.157 --> 01:19:03.666
-It's still too soon.

01:19:03.691 --> 01:19:06.990
-I agree. There is no
place they can't reach.

01:19:07.454 --> 01:19:10.187
And then we have nowhere
to run and nowhere to hide.

01:19:12.409 --> 01:19:14.526
-Wow, you finished it!
-Yeah.

01:19:15.541 --> 01:19:17.536
-It's beautiful!

01:19:20.591 --> 01:19:25.809
-Thanks. Look, this...this
is the cage and protects processing unit.

01:19:25.891 --> 01:19:27.951
I think I'm going to
build another one and

01:19:27.976 --> 01:19:29.391
I'm going to make a
communication system

01:19:29.416 --> 01:19:31.852
between them. Then I'll
replicate them and

01:19:31.877 --> 01:19:34.119
we'll be able to point
them everywhere.

01:19:34.144 --> 01:19:36.877
You know, get one-one man shifts.
They'll rest a little more and...

01:19:36.902 --> 01:19:38.653
-And we'll have more worthless toys.

01:19:38.678 --> 01:19:41.384
And time wasted on maintenance and repairs.

01:19:41.917 --> 01:19:44.749
Ok, fifteen minutes'
rest and then we leave.

01:19:44.774 --> 01:19:46.763
I'll stand guard
while you get ready.

01:19:48.914 --> 01:19:51.498
-Look, why were you
so hard on him?

01:19:51.523 --> 01:19:54.235
Is that what you
consider life's purpose?

01:19:54.817 --> 01:19:57.968
Always on the go? Kill or be killed?

01:20:32.710 --> 01:20:34.124
-They're coming!

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:39.045
-They're coming. We're surrounded.

01:21:03.084 --> 01:21:06.964
This is it, we're trapped. -Fuck this!
let's hide in the corner.

01:21:06.989 --> 01:21:09.873
They'll break in, we'll finish them off.
We have enough charges and ammunition,

01:21:09.898 --> 01:21:14.750
-Negative. There's too many
of them. This must be the end.

01:21:15.055 --> 01:21:18.452
They become especially aggressive
and frenetic just before the end.

01:21:18.893 --> 01:21:21.306
They can smell and hear from
hundreds of yards away.

01:21:21.331 --> 01:21:22.605
Gather within seconds.

01:21:22.630 --> 01:21:26.388
 If we went in a corridor,
a narrow killing zone perhaps,

01:21:26.413 --> 01:21:30.552
but this way, they'll reach us long before
we can do any serious damage.

01:21:30.577 --> 01:21:34.335
-Her love. That's what you are.

01:21:35.028 --> 01:21:38.288
Always remember that.
Love.

01:21:38.993 --> 01:21:41.030
There is nothing else, understand?

01:21:45.407 --> 01:21:49.325
-There's always hope.
You just need to take a good look around.

01:21:52.019 --> 01:21:56.072
-Wait, wait. If they all
 enter the hall all at once,

01:21:56.097 --> 01:21:59.488
We simultaneously blow off the charges.
stay close to the ceiling.

01:21:59.513 --> 01:22:00.642
-Yeah, perhaps.

01:22:00.719 --> 01:22:04.781
It might buy us several minutes before
next wave. We've got nothing to lose.

01:22:05.476 --> 01:22:09.515
They'll  help you deploy the charges,
I'll take care of the rest.

01:22:55.409 --> 01:22:59.445
-Come on! -Detonators.
I'm right behind you!

01:22:59.669 --> 01:23:01.202
Go!

01:23:06.983 --> 01:23:08.706
-Come on!

01:23:10.673 --> 01:23:12.179
Come on!

01:23:16.173 --> 01:23:19.313
-Move! Move! Move!
-She's not going to make it! Come on!

01:23:23.059 --> 01:23:25.571
They're going to kill her!
Let me to do it!

01:23:25.583 --> 01:23:26.424
No!

01:23:27.527 --> 01:23:30.424
Come on!
-Not yet! Not yet!

01:24:07.935 --> 01:24:09.481
-No!

01:24:24.281 --> 01:24:25.744
No!

01:25:14.371 --> 01:25:18.247
 -It's time to go to the desert.
 -Leave me.

01:25:18.348 --> 01:25:21.867
I'm dead.
 Go.

01:25:22.727 --> 01:25:24.076
Good luck.

01:25:56.303 --> 01:26:01.191
Why didn’t you leave there?
I am a dead man. We all are.

01:26:01.323 --> 01:26:07.399
-You're badly hurt, but it's not over yet.
She's dead, but you're still alive.

01:26:08.844 --> 01:26:13.667
-So you're doing this for her? For
the idiot, that fucking hypocrite.

01:26:13.797 --> 01:26:16.755
-Shut your mouth. You hear me?

01:26:17.733 --> 01:26:20.261
-You're not...
-I'm not what?

01:26:21.027 --> 01:26:26.236
Jesus Christ! I'm sick and tired
of the pretense and the hypocrisy!

01:26:27.856 --> 01:26:33.392
What do you think? What was
she thinking? What are all thinking?

01:26:34.302 --> 01:26:38.292
that if you help your fellow
man and simply live and do no wrong,

01:26:38.317 --> 01:26:40.737
That absolves you from
any responsibility

01:26:40.762 --> 01:26:41.937
for what goes on around you?

01:26:42.690 --> 01:26:46.421
The essence of life
is murder and suffering.

01:26:47.301 --> 01:26:49.498
Every time you eat
to sustain yourself,

01:26:49.523 --> 01:26:52.354
you're feeding off the death
of a living creature.

01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:54.700
-Plants and animals aren't like that.

01:26:55.887 --> 01:26:57.852
-Plants, animals?

01:26:58.828 --> 01:27:01.867
Every time you turn on the
light or drive a car,

01:27:01.892 --> 01:27:04.533
someone somewhere
dies of lung cancer.

01:27:04.558 --> 01:27:06.871
Every time you
buy something  for peanuts,

01:27:06.896 --> 01:27:10.736
some kid dies in a
third world sweat shop. -It's enough.

01:27:11.509 --> 01:27:14.571
You don't know what you're talking about.
You're delirious.

01:27:14.596 --> 01:27:15.691
- Jesus.

01:27:16.109 --> 01:27:17.691
Again with the denial.

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:23.756
You know I'm dead,
but you think like her.

01:27:24.484 --> 01:27:28.928
That if you treat me,
maybe ease my pain,

01:27:29.029 --> 01:27:30.970
It'll make you a better person.

01:27:32.402 --> 01:27:36.724
Love, grace, pity.

01:27:38.406 --> 01:27:42.199
Fuck you! You're doing it for yourself.

01:27:42.887 --> 01:27:46.247
You're just like her.
On the run and killing

01:27:46.259 --> 01:27:49.557
in an attempt to live
and not to be killed.

01:27:49.582 --> 01:27:53.572
No more, no less
a murder than the rest of us.

01:27:53.673 --> 01:27:58.013
You can say anything you want about me, but
don't you dare say anything about her.

01:27:58.639 --> 01:28:01.158
-Don't dare?
Don't dare ?!

01:28:03.153 --> 01:28:05.730
Let me tell you something about that bitch.

01:28:06.653 --> 01:28:11.601
Why do you think I chose her hospital
out of all the hospitals? Huh? Why?

01:28:13.109 --> 01:28:15.944
Because it was part of the program.

01:28:16.362 --> 01:28:20.200
It was a research hospital
that was part of the program.

01:28:20.225 --> 01:28:23.076
I hoped there would
be research subjects there.

01:28:23.101 --> 01:28:28.524
I was curious. Curious to know
how my project turned out.

01:28:28.549 --> 01:28:30.979
-No, I don't believe you.

01:28:31.201 --> 01:28:35.901
I don't . -You knew all along.
All this time you knew.

01:28:37.295 --> 01:28:39.605
-Oh, yeah. I knew.

01:28:41.707 --> 01:28:45.443
And what that little shit said when
she blew his brains out is true.

01:28:46.797 --> 01:28:50.468
I am God. I'm God!

01:28:52.414 --> 01:28:55.398
What was the idiot
thinking when she killed it?

01:28:56.248 --> 01:29:01.472
That she'd spare him the pain? That she's
keeping me from confronting the truth?

01:29:01.573 --> 01:29:05.952
That ignorant, phony moron.
I know the truth!

01:29:06.276 --> 01:29:09.565
I know who I and what I am!
I have come up with

01:29:09.577 --> 01:29:12.810
the idea for the experiment,
for Christs sake!

01:29:13.766 --> 01:29:18.220
I set up the meetings.
I wrote the memos, I pushed,

01:29:18.321 --> 01:29:22.874
pressured, persuaded, hinted,
contrived, falsified signatures.

01:29:23.014 --> 01:29:25.269
The head hunches never
would have approved it if

01:29:25.281 --> 01:29:27.640
someone like me hadn’t
been pulling the strings.

01:29:28.368 --> 01:29:33.073
This was my baby!
The highlight of my career!

01:29:34.351 --> 01:29:38.938
The entire damned,
monstrosity of an experiment!

01:29:44.604 --> 01:29:46.534
It couldn't have been worse.

01:29:49.138 --> 01:29:53.046
I killed them. All of them.

01:29:55.310 --> 01:30:00.905
I didn't just pull the trigger,
I eliminated all of them.

01:30:03.934 --> 01:30:09.670
We're all murderers. I'm just a little
more successful than most, that's all.

01:30:10.463 --> 01:30:14.259
But your sister, a saint,
sheer perfection,

01:30:14.962 --> 01:30:19.333
worked at a hospital that took
 part in an experiment. -No.

01:30:20.001 --> 01:30:24.412
I don't believe you. She would
never have... -Never have what?

01:30:24.513 --> 01:30:31.103
Stupid bitch. She lived,
therefore was a murderer!

01:30:33.088 --> 01:30:36.910
You want to save me. You can't.

01:30:37.454 --> 01:30:42.006
I'm dead. The infected didn't attack me.

01:30:43.118 --> 01:30:46.600
I contracted it, too.
Right from the start.

01:30:47.229 --> 01:30:53.352
And it has no cure. I know because
I made sure there wouldn't be one!

01:30:54.314 --> 01:30:58.346
It's Ok. You're sick,
it all makes sense.

01:30:58.907 --> 01:31:02.885
-We're all sick. We live,
therefore, we're sick!

01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:05.679
Life is a disease!

01:31:06.766 --> 01:31:11.256
We're all murderers. You and him.

01:31:11.357 --> 01:31:14.179
And your sister and your father.

01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:31.036
See...

01:31:49.178 --> 01:31:51.248
You want to...

01:31:53.626 --> 01:31:57.420
We want to... -do
this properly.

01:31:59.953 --> 01:32:03.529
We clean him up and dress him.

01:32:05.652 --> 01:32:10.185
And we'll  put him in a boat like a
Viking noble, by the book.

01:32:13.792 --> 01:32:17.235
We'll find two
trucks, and load them up

01:32:17.336 --> 01:32:19.929
everything  we need and
we'll drive to the desert.

01:32:34.135 --> 01:32:38.000
-It is possible that no
one theory is incorrect.

01:32:40.099 --> 01:32:42.407
And maybe they all are.

01:32:44.330 --> 01:32:51.048
Perhaps it was not just one event and the
end never came from a single source.

01:32:51.263 --> 01:32:56.068
but a combination of factors,
some related and some not.

01:32:58.401 --> 01:33:02.395
Something damaged the fragile balance
of the dinosaur ecosystem.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:05.767
Maybe the dinosaurs themselves.

01:33:07.408 --> 01:33:11.718
Maybe small rodents. In any case,

01:33:12.171 --> 01:33:18.942
just then when they were most vulnerable,
a large meteor struck Earth.

01:33:19.298 --> 01:33:24.192
causing a chain of earthquakes and
volcanic eruptions throughout the world.

01:33:32.396 --> 01:33:36.628
-A Meteor, eruptions,
earthquakes, imbalance.

01:33:40.204 --> 01:33:43.501
Each of these itself
was not enough.

01:33:43.961 --> 01:33:50.240
But together, they caused
everything to collapse.

01:35:32.288 --> 01:35:36.678
