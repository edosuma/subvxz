[music playing]

00:08.309 --> 00:09.277
You OK, David?

00:09.310 --> 00:11.312
You look a little peaked.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.280
See, David?

00:12.313 --> 00:15.416
I told you you were
looking better.

00:15.449 --> 00:18.052
I'm just feeling a
little queasy is all.

00:18.086 --> 00:20.020
He thinks he's
having pregnancy pains.

00:20.054 --> 00:21.655
Tell him that
that's not possible.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.057
Well, I don't know, Darlene.

00:23.091 --> 00:27.461
When my water broke, your
father wet his pants.

00:27.495 --> 00:28.929
Oh, hey, honey,
that three-fingered

00:28.962 --> 00:31.632
guy down at the hardware store,
he asked me for my autograph.

00:31.665 --> 00:32.666
Which three-fingered guy?

00:32.700 --> 00:36.036
None of them down
there have a full set.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.406
Man, ever since
the lottery thing,

00:38.439 --> 00:40.774
see, everybody wants to
get a little piece of us.

00:40.808 --> 00:41.775
It's OK with me.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.043
Finally, I'm starting
to hear a little

00:43.077 --> 00:45.946
sweet talk from the ladies.

00:45.979 --> 00:50.351
Yeah, you know, Grandma's been
a lot nicer to me, too, lately.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.819
I mean the girls
at school, Darlene.

00:51.852 --> 00:53.354
All right, get this.

00:53.387 --> 00:54.855
OK, I was sitting
there, and there

00:54.888 --> 00:56.790
was an empty seat next to
me in the cafeteria, and--

00:56.824 --> 00:57.958
Like there always is.

00:57.991 --> 00:59.427
All right.

00:59.460 --> 01:02.396
Karen Baylor goes to sit
down, and Susie Johnson throws

01:02.430 --> 01:04.365
an elbow and takes the seat.

01:04.398 --> 01:05.833
Two girls fighting?

01:05.866 --> 01:08.102
That is so sad.

01:08.136 --> 01:09.637
It's not sad, stupid.

01:09.670 --> 01:10.471
It's erotic.

01:15.776 --> 01:16.944
Oh, I gotta tell you.

01:16.977 --> 01:18.879
The freakiest thing
happened to me, too.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.614
I'm down at the dry
cleaners, and the guy

01:20.648 --> 01:22.383
down there that
owns the place, he

01:22.416 --> 01:25.353
asked me to say a blessing
over his lottery ticket.

01:25.386 --> 01:28.256
What didst thou say unto him?

01:28.289 --> 01:29.957
Well, I gave him
the Girl Scout pledge

01:29.990 --> 01:31.159
and a couple of Hail Marys.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.526
And then I waved
my hand around it,

01:32.560 --> 01:34.728
you know, just for the show.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.431
You know what I just realized?

01:37.465 --> 01:39.967
Next to that duck walking around
with the arrow in its neck,

01:40.000 --> 01:43.070
we're the most famous
thing in Lanford.

01:43.103 --> 01:46.140
[theme - blues traveler]

01:46.174 --> 01:50.178
THEME SONG: If what doesn't
kill us is making us stronger,

01:50.211 --> 01:55.183
we're gonna last longer than
that greatest wall in China

01:55.216 --> 01:58.652
or that rabbit with the drum.

01:58.686 --> 02:03.591
If there's one thing that
I've learned while waiting

02:03.624 --> 02:08.061
for my turn, it's that in
each life some rain falls,

02:08.095 --> 02:11.031
but you also get some sun.

02:11.064 --> 02:14.001
And we'll make out
better than OK.

02:14.034 --> 02:17.938
Hey, hear what I say.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.841
Hey, any day.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.527
So the duck's the most
famous thing in Lanford.

02:39.560 --> 02:40.394
We're number two, right?

02:40.428 --> 02:41.495
Absolutely.

02:41.529 --> 02:44.698
Duck, us.

02:44.732 --> 02:46.800
What was number two before us?

02:46.834 --> 02:48.402
That's a tough call.

02:48.436 --> 02:51.071
Probably that guy that dropped
his pants down at the bank

02:51.104 --> 02:54.007
for "Funniest Home Videos".

02:54.041 --> 02:55.876
God, that made me so damn mad.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.645
You could tell that
was totally fixed.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.213
He was probably going
around with his pants

02:59.247 --> 03:02.383
unbuttoned the whole damn time.

03:02.416 --> 03:03.917
Makes you not want to
keep your money there,

03:03.951 --> 03:05.919
I'll tell you that.

03:05.953 --> 03:07.221
That's for damn sure.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.922
Hey, I forgot to tell you.

03:08.956 --> 03:12.025
Becky called from the
carnival with the boys.

03:12.059 --> 03:14.094
She says they're
having a great time.

03:14.127 --> 03:17.265
And our little Jerry won
the pie-eating contest.

03:17.298 --> 03:18.098
Prodigy.

03:21.068 --> 03:23.304
Oh, has anybody
seen Leon lately?

03:23.337 --> 03:26.640
Ever since we won the
lottery, he looks like hell.

03:26.674 --> 03:27.675
I know.

03:27.708 --> 03:28.976
I saw him the other day.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.311
He looked like such a slob,
I thought he was straight.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.147
When's he going
to get over it?

03:34.181 --> 03:35.048
Never.

03:35.082 --> 03:38.085
Not as long as I'm alive.

03:38.118 --> 03:39.387
I forgot to tell
you who I ran into.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.888
John McCord.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.956
John McCord, remember,
of varsity track?

03:42.990 --> 03:45.393
He's the guy that dressed
like the guy in "Mod Squad".

03:45.426 --> 03:46.694
Which guy in "Mod Squad"?

03:46.727 --> 03:50.298
Linc or the white guy you
can never remember his name?

03:50.331 --> 03:51.632
Come on, Roseanne.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.567
You know, John McCord, the
first shag haircut in Lanford.

03:53.601 --> 03:54.702
JACKIE: Yeah, that guy.

03:54.735 --> 03:55.936
Anyway, he corners me
in the fruit section,

03:55.969 --> 03:58.306
and hes asks me out,
as if the lottery

03:58.339 --> 04:00.240
had nothing to do with that.

04:00.274 --> 04:01.174
But you're going, right?

04:01.208 --> 04:02.009
Hell yes, I'm going.

04:05.679 --> 04:09.216
Hey, guess what
happened to me?

04:09.249 --> 04:11.685
Got a call from the
mayor of Lanford.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.253
What, is he trying to
sell you some more Amway?

04:15.923 --> 04:17.024
No, actually.

04:17.057 --> 04:21.529
This time, he called as
the mayor of Lanford.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.464
He wants me to ride in the
Thanksgiving Day Parade.

04:23.497 --> 04:24.365
Wow.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.834
That is an honor.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.602
Yeah, it's me and
some old guy that

04:28.636 --> 04:30.571
was like the last
soldier that ever fought

04:30.604 --> 04:34.308
in World War I or something.

04:34.342 --> 04:36.009
Hey, I hope people
in this town don't

04:36.043 --> 04:38.446
mistake me for Anna Nicole
Smith and her old husband.

04:43.951 --> 04:46.354
Yeah, we really are
becoming celebrities.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.688
Yeah.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.490
It's just kind of not what I
thought it was going to be,

04:49.523 --> 04:50.491
you know?

04:50.524 --> 04:52.826
I kind of thought
it was going to be

04:52.860 --> 04:54.094
more exciting or something.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.496
I don't know.

04:55.529 --> 05:00.334
How come that Ted Koppel
ain't called us yet?

05:00.368 --> 05:03.170
Nah, he's lost his edge.

05:03.203 --> 05:06.940
Well, he's now Jerry
Springer, that's for damn sure.

05:06.974 --> 05:07.875
AUDIENCE: Jerry!

05:07.908 --> 05:08.842

05:08.876 --> 05:09.810

05:10.811 --> 05:11.879
JERRY SPRINGER:
Thank you very much.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.113
Oh, aren't you nice.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.548
Hey, thank you very much.
Come on.

05:14.582 --> 05:15.649
Thank you.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.651
Hey, let's talk about
the American dream.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.119
A good job, a good home.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.588
Hey, how about
winning the lottery?

05:20.621 --> 05:23.391
Well, my guests tonight
did exactly that.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.759
They're just ordinary folks
from Lanford, Illinois.

05:25.793 --> 05:27.928
Please welcome Roseanne
and Dan Conner.

05:37.505 --> 05:41.409
Wow. $108 million.

05:41.442 --> 05:44.211
How did you feel when
you got the news?

05:44.244 --> 05:45.546
Well, you gotta
understand, Jerry.

05:45.579 --> 05:46.814
I'm recovering
from a major heart

05:46.847 --> 05:49.049
attack, or a
myocardial infarction,

05:49.082 --> 05:50.418
as the doctors call it.

05:50.451 --> 05:54.788
And see, I was at my daughter's
wedding, which I guess

05:54.822 --> 05:56.424
contributed to the stress.

05:56.457 --> 05:59.059
Plus I had me a couple
bacon, butter, mayonnaise

05:59.092 --> 06:01.328
sandwiches for
breakfast, which probably

06:01.361 --> 06:03.697
contributed to the clog.

06:03.731 --> 06:04.832
Yeah.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.133
Well, also, you forgot
to tell us-- you're not

06:06.166 --> 06:07.167
starting in the right place.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.702
You gotta-- that
was like before,

06:08.736 --> 06:10.638
and then here we were a
little bit later, after

06:10.671 --> 06:12.039
you came home and everything.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.642
So well, we just had this
big fight, you know--

06:14.675 --> 06:15.743
DAN: Yeah, we had
a big wingding.

06:15.776 --> 06:17.144
ROSEANNE: --was
like the worst fight

06:17.177 --> 06:18.746
ever, so we thought we were like
going to break up or something,

06:18.779 --> 06:19.947
you know.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.749
But then everything worked
out, so that was cool.

06:21.782 --> 06:22.816
I tell you--

06:22.850 --> 06:23.751
wait a minute.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.052
Let's just slow
down a little bit.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.386
What I want to know
is, how did you--

06:26.420 --> 06:27.921
how did you find
out that you won?

06:27.955 --> 06:29.590
Well, we were sleeping.

06:29.623 --> 06:30.991
Yeah.

06:31.024 --> 06:31.825
Sort of.

06:40.133 --> 06:41.835
Anyway, her sister comes over.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.203
Yeah, my sister comes in.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.839
And she's like, Roseanne,
Roseanne, you know.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.908
So I go out there
and everything, and--

06:47.941 --> 06:50.478
Kind of put me off my feet.

06:50.511 --> 06:51.979
Sorry, honey.

06:52.012 --> 06:54.448
And so I go out there,
and she's like, hey,

06:54.482 --> 06:55.483
you guys won the lottery.

06:55.516 --> 06:56.584
I'm like, what?

06:56.617 --> 06:58.418
[muttering] You know,
so we were like kind

06:58.452 --> 07:00.821
of just screaming and freaking
out and stuff, you know.

07:00.854 --> 07:01.822
Yeah.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.423
We had a real big wingding.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.559
Mrs. jumped up on my back--

07:05.593 --> 07:06.494
Wasn't-- wasn't--

07:06.527 --> 07:07.895
DAN: --running around--

07:07.928 --> 07:10.030
--but wasn't there like some
interesting story about how--

07:10.063 --> 07:10.931
Oh, yeah.

07:10.964 --> 07:11.832
Well, I was getting to that.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.133
I better-- OK.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.435
Well, so my husband was in
the hospital and everything.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.304
He's there in his
room and everything.

07:17.337 --> 07:19.072
Well, like, I didn't--

07:19.106 --> 07:20.508
well, I was just trying
to keep my mind off

07:20.541 --> 07:22.309
of what was going on
because, you know, I mean,

07:22.342 --> 07:23.877
I didn't know if my
husband was getting better.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.278
I was like--
- Because of the infarction.

07:25.312 --> 07:26.413
Yeah, the infarction.

07:26.446 --> 07:29.049
And I was just getting
really nervous about it.

07:29.082 --> 07:30.818
So like I was trying
to just kill time.

07:30.851 --> 07:33.787
Not really kill time, but just
kind of take my mind off of,

07:33.821 --> 07:35.556
you know, worrying
about my husband.

07:35.589 --> 07:38.225
So like I went down and I
bought this lottery ticket,

07:38.258 --> 07:41.228
and I worked out this
whole kind of system

07:41.261 --> 07:43.964
for like how to
pick the numbers,

07:43.997 --> 07:44.965
because like I picked out--

07:44.998 --> 07:45.933
OK.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.935
I picked 36 for
the number of times

07:47.968 --> 07:50.303
I salted my hospital food.

07:50.337 --> 07:52.806
And then 8 for the
number of parking

07:52.840 --> 07:56.343
tickets I got for parking
in the ambulance only zone.

07:56.376 --> 07:57.344
[flustered stuttering]

07:57.377 --> 07:58.812
Like wasn't your
sister involved and--

07:58.846 --> 08:00.180
Oh, yeah.

08:00.213 --> 08:02.049
She's the one that, you know,
found out first and told us.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.116
I got it.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.184
Why-- why don't we
bring out your sister?

08:04.217 --> 08:06.119
Here's Roseanne's
sister, Jackie Harris.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.927
Jackie, welcome to the show.

08:13.961 --> 08:18.599
What is your part in
this fascinating story?

08:18.632 --> 08:21.368
Well, uh, like, I picked
out three of the numbers,

08:21.401 --> 08:22.870
and then she picked out
three of the numbers.

08:22.903 --> 08:25.939
And then I was the one that saw
that we won the lottery on TV.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.007
So I go running over there.

08:27.040 --> 08:27.908
I'm like, Roseanne,
Roseanne, you know.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.009
And she's like, what?

08:29.042 --> 08:29.977
And I'm like, you know,
we won the lottery.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.278
And she's like, what?

08:31.311 --> 08:33.947
You know, so I'm like, uh,
no-- we wanted to tell Dan,

08:33.981 --> 08:35.315
but we didn't know
how because, you know,

08:35.348 --> 08:36.717
he had the heart attack.
ROSEANNE: The heart attack.

08:36.750 --> 08:37.785
Yeah.

08:37.818 --> 08:40.487
See, I'm not supposed
to have any stress

08:40.520 --> 08:42.790
or lift up anything
heavy or whatnot

08:42.823 --> 08:45.058
because the whole thing could
just pop like that again.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.560
So tell them what you
said about the heart.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.195
Oh, well, I told my husband--

08:48.228 --> 08:50.263
after we won and everything,
I told my husband,

08:50.297 --> 08:52.700
I said, "Honey, you don't even
have to worry about, you know,

08:52.733 --> 08:54.367
your bad ticker
anymore because now we

08:54.401 --> 08:56.336
got enough money to buy you
one of those baboon heart

08:56.369 --> 08:57.237
transplants."

08:57.270 --> 08:58.138
Oh, yeah.

08:58.171 --> 08:59.472
Baboon heart transplant.

08:59.506 --> 09:05.045
Or a-- a pig valve or whatever
science has come up with.

09:05.078 --> 09:08.115
How did it feel?

09:08.148 --> 09:09.883
DAN: Well, I felt this
paint going up my arm--

09:09.917 --> 09:10.718
JACKIE: I couldn't believe it.
DAN: --you know.

09:10.751 --> 09:11.952
It felt like somebody was sit--

09:11.985 --> 09:13.286
JACKIE: She couldn't believe
it, either, you know.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.855
So then I go rushing over there,
you know, and I tell them,

09:14.888 --> 09:15.789
and they're like, whoa!

09:15.823 --> 09:16.690
You know.

09:16.724 --> 09:17.858
Then I'm like, whoa!

09:17.891 --> 09:19.059
You know?

09:19.092 --> 09:25.332
And then, uh-- then we sat
around for a little bit.

09:25.365 --> 09:28.468
And then, oh, I,
see, was like, whoa.

09:31.204 --> 09:32.305
Yeah, Jerry.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.407
See, I felt bad because
I had my heart attack

09:34.441 --> 09:36.343
at my daughter's wedding.

09:36.376 --> 09:39.980
And you know, she had
to get married because--

09:40.013 --> 09:42.916
Honey, don't say
that on television.

09:42.950 --> 09:46.253
How-- how did the
lottery change your life?

09:46.286 --> 09:47.955
How did the lottery
change your life?

09:47.988 --> 09:48.856
ROSEANNE: Oh, well--

09:48.889 --> 09:52.059
I got a date with John McCord.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.060
DAN: Oh, yeah.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.929
Then we had that
writer from toda-- uh,

09:55.963 --> 09:57.665
"Good Morning America," Kath--

09:57.698 --> 09:58.999
- Kathleen Sullivan came over.
- Yeah.

09:59.032 --> 09:59.967
She interviewed us.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.301
Now, is she Ed
Sullivan's daughter?

10:01.334 --> 10:02.670
I think she is, yeah.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.071
You know--

10:04.104 --> 10:05.639
Why-- why don't we bring out
the rest of the Conner family,

10:05.673 --> 10:06.640
OK?

10:06.674 --> 10:07.908
Here's the rest of
the Conner family.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.521
Wel-- welcome,
everybody, to the show.

10:21.554 --> 10:26.426
Your mom-- your mom
has won $108 million.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.728
How do you guys feel?

10:27.761 --> 10:30.563
I am the mother of
the girls, Mr. Springer.

10:30.597 --> 10:31.732
Mrs. Beverly Harris.

10:31.765 --> 10:34.634
Oh, how proud you must be.

10:34.668 --> 10:36.369
You know, now that
we have this money,

10:36.403 --> 10:39.072
I don't have to be
a Democrat anymore.

10:42.843 --> 10:43.711
Any questions?

10:43.744 --> 10:44.812
Yes, yours?

10:44.845 --> 10:45.746
Hi.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.848
So-- so how much
money did you win?

10:53.086 --> 10:57.090
Uh, well, we only said it
108 million times, you [bleep]..

10:59.727 --> 11:00.660
Hey.

11:00.694 --> 11:03.463
Uh, I think you
should listen to her

11:03.496 --> 11:06.566
and what she says
about those guys.

11:06.599 --> 11:10.403
And he should listen to
her about the other one.

11:10.437 --> 11:12.740
AUDIENCE: [applauding]

11:17.745 --> 11:18.746
Yeah.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.247
Now that you guys
have all that money,

11:20.280 --> 11:21.048
why don't you give me some?

11:24.752 --> 11:25.685
Sure.

11:25.719 --> 11:29.122
I ain't never heard
that one before.

11:29.156 --> 11:34.127
I want to say that you people
are living proof that God takes

11:34.161 --> 11:36.029
care of children and fools.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.534
What did you say?

11:41.568 --> 11:43.036
You heard me!

11:43.070 --> 11:44.537
I said--

11:44.571 --> 11:48.976
Talk to the hand because
the face does not understand.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.979
[angry yelling]

11:52.012 --> 11:53.947
Sit your big [bleep] down.

11:53.981 --> 11:55.849
Sit your big [bleep] down.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.223
OK.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.325
Yeah, well, we-- we don't
understand how a jerk like you

12:05.358 --> 12:07.394
could win the lottery, anyway.

12:07.427 --> 12:10.363
That's my wife you're
talking to, [bleep]!!

12:10.397 --> 12:12.833
[bleep]

12:12.866 --> 12:14.501
Well, that's
about as good a time

12:14.534 --> 12:16.804
as any for my final thought.

12:16.837 --> 12:19.840
Well, I think what we see here
today is that money obviously--

12:19.873 --> 12:20.841
Jerry!
Jerry!

12:20.874 --> 12:21.741
--have a negative--

12:21.775 --> 12:23.243
I have a final thought.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.712
Well, if life hands
you a negative,

12:25.745 --> 12:27.881
don't despair because
one day it just may

12:27.915 --> 12:30.017
develop into a pretty picture.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.901
Oh, the freakiest thing
happened to me today.

12:47.935 --> 12:50.838
David and I got this call from
our friendly morticians over

12:50.871 --> 12:52.072
at Janetti & Sons.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.075
Ooh, Janetti & Sons.

12:55.108 --> 12:58.778
They don't bury just anybody.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.914
Well, they were
very eager to assist

13:00.948 --> 13:04.484
us with our after life needs.

13:04.517 --> 13:09.256
I told them I already bought
a shovel and a big bag of lime.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.523
Would you pass me some beans?

13:10.557 --> 13:12.592
Yes, I could.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.194
Glad to see somebody
likes his vegetables.

13:14.227 --> 13:15.295
I'm not going to eat them.

13:15.328 --> 13:18.031
I'm just going to suck
the glaze off them.

13:18.065 --> 13:19.032
That's all right.

13:19.066 --> 13:20.333
Mom will just reglaze
them tomorrow.

13:24.437 --> 13:25.305
Hello?

13:25.338 --> 13:26.139
Mom?

13:28.441 --> 13:30.110
Honey?
You OK?

13:30.143 --> 13:31.811
You haven't said anything
in the last five minutes.

13:31.845 --> 13:33.813
Yeah, I actually
started to relax.

13:38.585 --> 13:39.452
Sorry, guys.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.388
I just kind of spaced out there.

13:41.421 --> 13:42.722
Thinking about the money, huh?

13:42.755 --> 13:44.624
I've been doing that, too.

13:44.657 --> 13:47.928
Changes the way you look
at the world, doesn't it?

13:47.961 --> 13:49.029
Yeah.

13:49.062 --> 13:51.598
And also the way the
world looks at you.

13:51.631 --> 13:52.532
Yeah.

13:52.565 --> 13:53.366
Yeah.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.672
Nature hasn't been
too good to you girls.

13:59.706 --> 14:03.376
You're going to put
me out of a job.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.844
Well, that was just good enough.

14:04.878 --> 14:05.745
OK.

14:05.778 --> 14:07.114
Now let's get started.

14:07.147 --> 14:10.483
I just want you both to
relax and move to the music.

14:10.517 --> 14:14.321
[music - "super freak"]

14:16.856 --> 14:18.291
I don't know, Avalon.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.227
AVALON: Hey, just forget
Leonard and I are here.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.629
Make me sweat!

14:22.662 --> 14:23.696
Get it.

14:23.730 --> 14:26.266
Open up the estrogen
tap and let it flow!

14:26.299 --> 14:27.667
Come on.
You're rich.

14:27.700 --> 14:28.835
You're sexy.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.704
You're totally happy.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.140
Well, I'm just--

14:33.173 --> 14:34.574
I don't know, Avalon.

14:34.607 --> 14:35.742
I'm really nervous.

14:35.775 --> 14:37.610
I mean, I'm nervous
about how I'm gonna look.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.512
I've been freaking out
kids since the '70s.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.481
You have nothing to
worry about, darling.

14:41.514 --> 14:42.749
Women are born beautiful.

14:42.782 --> 14:44.584
It's all done with
the magic of light.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.353
Here, I'll take a Polaroid
and I'll show you.

14:51.591 --> 14:52.392
Voila.

14:56.696 --> 14:58.065
Oh, my God.

14:58.098 --> 14:58.966
Look, Jackie.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.234
It really is about the lighting.

15:01.268 --> 15:04.337
Now get back out there
and show me what you've got.

15:13.880 --> 15:17.350
She's a very kinky girl.

15:17.384 --> 15:21.354
The kind you don't
take home to mother.

15:21.388 --> 15:25.592
She will never let your
spirits down once you

15:25.625 --> 15:27.094
get her off the street.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.561
Ow, girl.

15:28.595 --> 15:32.032
She likes the boys in the band.

15:32.065 --> 15:35.969
She says that I'm her
all-time favorite.

15:36.003 --> 15:39.906
When I make my move to her
room, it's the right time.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.874
She's never hard to please.

15:41.908 --> 15:43.343
No, no.

15:43.376 --> 15:45.812
That girl is pretty wild now.

15:45.845 --> 15:47.314
That girl's a super freak.

15:47.347 --> 15:49.282
The kinda girl you read about.

15:49.316 --> 15:50.750
In new-wave magazines.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.719
That girl is pretty kinky.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.687
That girl's a super freak.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.656
I'd really love to taste her.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.158
Every time we meet.

15:58.191 --> 16:00.327
She's all right.

16:00.360 --> 16:01.528
She's all right.

16:01.561 --> 16:07.367
That girl's all right with me.

16:07.400 --> 16:08.201
Yeah.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.207
ALL: [laughing]

16:15.808 --> 16:18.011
Yes, you were brilliant.

16:18.045 --> 16:19.679
Aw, thank you.

16:19.712 --> 16:24.284
Well, that's why I'm
the new Guess girl.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.785
Oh, my God.

16:25.818 --> 16:26.719
It's Hef!

16:30.290 --> 16:31.758
Hi, Hef!

16:31.791 --> 16:33.760
Hello.

16:33.793 --> 16:37.430
I want you to know this is
something really special.

16:37.464 --> 16:40.400
Oh, you know, I just
want to tell you that you

16:40.433 --> 16:44.204
single-handedly revolutionized
America's puritanical morals,

16:44.237 --> 16:46.539
and I personally
want to thank you.

16:46.573 --> 16:47.907
Well, I want to
thank you for one

16:47.940 --> 16:50.143
of the most memorable shootings
in "Playboy's" history.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.011
Oh, Hef!

16:52.045 --> 16:54.114
I bet you say that
to all the girls.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.115
Of course I do.

16:58.218 --> 17:02.155
All 14,980 of them?

17:02.189 --> 17:04.524
Yes, and I mean it every time.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.626
But I have to say
that you are the most

17:06.659 --> 17:08.761
beautiful woman on this Earth.

17:08.795 --> 17:09.662
Thank you.

17:09.696 --> 17:12.165
No, in the universe.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.133
Oh!

17:13.166 --> 17:13.966
Hef.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.740
Wow.

17:20.773 --> 17:23.476
The judges certainly wasted no
time in making that decision.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.678
Now let's see who'll
be sipping champagne

17:25.712 --> 17:30.317
and who will be, uh, ahem,
crying into their cold cream.

17:30.350 --> 17:31.651
Here we go.

17:31.684 --> 17:38.191
The new Miss Universe is Miss
Lanford, Roseanne Conner!

17:38.225 --> 17:40.160
I had no idea!

17:40.193 --> 17:43.062
Oh, Miss Lanford, you
are, without a doubt,

17:43.096 --> 17:45.498
the most voluptuous, beautiful
woman in the universe.

17:45.532 --> 17:48.135
I must admit I was
a little worried when

17:48.168 --> 17:50.470
they discovered life on Mars.

17:50.503 --> 17:54.241
Take your victory stroll
down the runway, girlfriend.

17:54.274 --> 17:57.076
[music playing]

17:57.110 --> 18:01.581
(SINGING) Here she is,
the blue-collared beauty.

18:01.614 --> 18:05.785
She's a real
trailblazing beauty.

18:05.818 --> 18:09.889
She's got a hell of a figure,
and she's still got a D cup.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.191
Woo!

18:11.224 --> 18:14.427
Maybe that's why she's the
winner and first runner-up.

18:14.461 --> 18:19.166
Yes, she's our
Miss Universe, USA.

18:22.469 --> 18:23.336
Oh, hold it!

18:23.370 --> 18:24.237
Hold it.

18:24.271 --> 18:25.405
Stop, please.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.807
I have just learned
that Miss Lanford has

18:27.840 --> 18:30.377
broken the pageant's
rules by posing

18:30.410 --> 18:32.279
for a commercial publication!

18:32.312 --> 18:33.180
Hey!

18:33.213 --> 18:34.881
Those were tasteful photos.

18:34.914 --> 18:38.117
It was just me and my sister,
naked in a tub full of money.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.752
Well, I am going to have
to strip you of your--

18:39.786 --> 18:40.453
- No!
- --crown.

18:40.487 --> 18:41.388
Yes!
- No!

18:41.421 --> 18:42.889
That's mine!
I want that.

18:42.922 --> 18:43.856
Give it back to me.

18:43.890 --> 18:44.824
It's mine!

18:44.857 --> 18:45.825
Give it to me!

18:45.858 --> 18:49.762
Give it to me!

18:49.796 --> 18:51.231
Give me that.
Give me that.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.199
It's mine.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.200
I deserve it!

18:53.233 --> 18:55.168
Mom, you're
giving me a blister.

18:55.202 --> 18:56.603
Deej, let her go.

18:56.636 --> 19:00.707
If your mom wants to salt
her ice cream, it's OK.

19:00.740 --> 19:01.908
You all right, honey?

19:04.444 --> 19:05.312
Of course I'm all right.

19:05.345 --> 19:06.479
I'm the new Guess girl.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.426
Hey, I just heard on the news.

19:19.459 --> 19:23.296
They got that arrow
out of the duck's neck.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.665
Oh, my God, do you
realize what this means?

19:25.698 --> 19:30.803
This means we are the
biggest thing in Lanford!

19:30.837 --> 19:32.772
ALL: We're number one!

19:32.805 --> 19:33.740
We're number one!

19:33.773 --> 19:35.675
We're number one!

19:35.708 --> 19:37.143
[cheering]

19:37.176 --> 19:38.110
Yeah!

19:38.144 --> 19:39.546
Yeah!

19:39.579 --> 19:41.648
Mom, I kind of need
to talk to you.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.015
It's important.
- Why?

19:43.049 --> 19:44.116
What's the matter?

19:44.150 --> 19:44.984
Well, the other day,
we were sitting in--

19:45.017 --> 19:45.885
DIRECTOR: Cut!

19:45.918 --> 19:47.086
That's a wrap.

19:47.119 --> 19:48.455
What do you mean, cut?

19:48.488 --> 19:50.189
We're not even done
with this scene.

19:50.223 --> 19:51.123
Sorry, Roseanne.

19:51.157 --> 19:52.525
I mean, this is
the 200th episode,

19:52.559 --> 19:55.127
and they said to tell you as
soon as the cake got here.

19:55.161 --> 19:56.596
Oh, the cake's here.
Come on.

19:56.629 --> 19:57.497
Let's go get some.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.865
Wait!

19:58.898 --> 20:00.900
I mean, what the hell happened
to our big mother/son scene?

20:00.933 --> 20:02.101
That was my shot at an Emmy!

20:07.073 --> 20:09.075
Well, I'm gonna
go have some cake.

20:09.108 --> 20:10.943
You know, go knock
yourself out there.

20:21.220 --> 20:25.492
Oh, Israel, your day
of reckoning has come.

20:25.525 --> 20:27.660
You have sinned a great sin.

20:27.694 --> 20:31.264
And you're not worthy to
receive these 10 commandments.

20:31.298 --> 20:35.034
The Almighty has proven
that your fate can overcome

20:35.067 --> 20:36.369
even the laws of nature.

20:40.172 --> 20:41.674
Blasphemers!

20:41.708 --> 20:43.376
You refuse to live by the law?

20:43.410 --> 20:45.912
Then you shall die by the law!

20:45.945 --> 20:48.815
[thundering]

20:53.920 --> 20:54.854
Oh!

20:54.887 --> 20:56.756
Well, they were very
tasteful photos.

20:56.789 --> 21:00.727
It was just me and my sister,
naked in a tub full of money.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.495
I am gonna have to
strip you of your crown.

21:02.529 --> 21:03.496
- No!
- I will--

21:03.530 --> 21:04.030
No!
No!

21:04.063 --> 21:04.964
That's mine!

21:04.997 --> 21:05.965
Give me that!

21:05.998 --> 21:07.467
- No, no, you will not.
- Give me that!

21:07.500 --> 21:08.368
No!

21:08.401 --> 21:09.902
I said, give me that!

21:16.476 --> 21:22.582
