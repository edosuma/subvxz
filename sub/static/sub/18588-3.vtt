WEBVTT

00:15.200 --> 00:19.000
Ah, you're looking very tidy
this day, ladies.

00:19.040 --> 00:22.799
As opposed to looking like soiled
bedding usually - is that it?

00:22.800 --> 00:25.679
Ignore her. She's ageing badly.

00:25.680 --> 00:26.960
Only on the outside.

00:37.680 --> 00:40.560
Ooh, she's got her sights on you!

00:45.480 --> 00:47.480
You're the only one who gets
a smile.

00:48.640 --> 00:50.439
That's not a smile.

00:50.440 --> 00:53.560
That's stage one of a fatal bite.

00:55.480 --> 00:58.600
What have you got for assassinating
the man in your life?

01:00.080 --> 01:01.640
What size?

01:59.320 --> 02:03.240
Did you see that? It's learning new
behaviour - and all of it is bad.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.440
HE IMITATES CHALK SQUEAKING

02:23.000 --> 02:25.200
Tell him we're just good friends!
Tell h...

02:26.640 --> 02:32.039
Ooh, you! Control to Leroy,
welcome to the planet Earth.

02:32.040 --> 02:33.680
At this hour, you're welcome to it.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.600
When I was your age,

02:35.640 --> 02:39.360
by this time I'd been up so long
it was nearly tomorrow.

02:45.120 --> 02:49.359
I don't suppose you happen to stock
Sanderson's little kidney pills?

02:49.360 --> 02:53.000
Sanderson's?
No, they went out in 1900.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.039
Oh, my granny used to swear
by them -

02:55.040 --> 02:56.600
and could she swear!

02:58.440 --> 03:02.560
Never had a granny. Although there's
one aged about 35 in Cooper Street

03:02.600 --> 03:03.760
I'd be happy to adopt.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.359
You keep away from grannies.

03:08.360 --> 03:11.079
They go off in this hot weather.

03:11.080 --> 03:13.120
What hot weather? Excuse me.

03:13.160 --> 03:16.159
There's me and my kidney still
waiting here.

03:16.160 --> 03:20.600
Gastric, you don't need Sanderson's
little kidney pills.

03:21.760 --> 03:24.480
Are you sure you've even got
a little kidney?

03:24.520 --> 03:26.599
No, you see,
I think we can do better.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.240
What, better than Sanderson's?

03:28.280 --> 03:32.480
Oh, yes. Now, then,
in a recent survey,

03:32.520 --> 03:39.439
four out of five people, when asked,
said, "Sanderson's who?"

03:39.440 --> 03:42.920
The fifth was a Bulgarian, but he
thought he was in the Post Office.

03:44.840 --> 03:46.520
I would have liked a granny.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.040
They keep better hours.

03:48.080 --> 03:51.280
Will you be quiet,
when I am trying to lie?

03:51.320 --> 03:53.120
Er, sell! When I am selling!

03:54.200 --> 03:56.560
This is a liquid.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.320
No fooling you, is there, eh?

03:59.360 --> 04:04.040
Yes, but that is not a liquid,
that is THE liquid.

04:04.080 --> 04:07.440
"Doctor Proctor's -
for coughs and sneezes."

04:07.480 --> 04:09.799
I'm not seeing any mention of
kidneys.

04:09.800 --> 04:12.760
No, because we daren't mention
kidneys.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.440
We daren't mention livers or
oesophagus

04:15.480 --> 04:19.120
or pituitary glands
cos that is discrimination.

04:19.160 --> 04:21.000
It's a legal minefield.

04:22.840 --> 04:23.840
I'd like a granny.

04:25.480 --> 04:29.280
They knit you things, they remember
birthdays and Christmas.

04:29.320 --> 04:32.559
I'd come home from a hard day's
delivering and you'd say,

04:32.560 --> 04:34.560
"Oh, look what your granny
sent you!"

04:41.720 --> 04:43.320
I just thought I'd mention it.

04:46.760 --> 04:50.079
So how does anybody know that
this stuff is good for kidneys?

04:50.080 --> 04:53.240
Well, it was voted Kidney Product
Of The Year

04:53.280 --> 04:56.080
by the Orpington
Chamber of Commerce.

04:58.160 --> 05:02.760
Not wishing to probe, Gastric,
but has your kidney moved?

05:05.880 --> 05:07.480
Where would it move to?

05:07.520 --> 05:10.880
I'll tell you what, put your hand
on your kidney.

05:10.920 --> 05:13.240
Go on.

05:13.280 --> 05:17.560
Yes. Right, I want you to take a
deep breath and give me a big cough.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.480
HE WHEEZES

05:24.960 --> 05:27.560
That's a terrible cough, that is,
isn't it?

05:27.600 --> 05:31.040
Take two teaspoonfuls of that
twice a day.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.760
Â£5.75.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.600
LOUD SQUEAK

06:03.960 --> 06:05.920
I wasn't asleep. I was wondering

06:05.960 --> 06:11.040
how the Chinese economy will affect
our pickled walnut sales. Yeah.

06:11.080 --> 06:15.480
Anyway, Mrs Willshaw has just gone
back to her lonely existence

06:15.520 --> 06:21.000
with some cod roe
and half a dozen dusty cupcakes.

06:21.040 --> 06:24.440
Why lonely? I know he's not
Hollywood material,

06:24.480 --> 06:26.439
but she's got Mr Willshaw.

06:26.440 --> 06:29.200
Yes, but Che says he lives
in their shed.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.600
He's building a robot.

06:35.840 --> 06:39.719
Anyway, I don't know why you sold
Gastric the cough medicine.

06:39.720 --> 06:43.520
Because we had no Sanderson's
little kidney pills.

06:43.560 --> 06:45.999
I know, but what we do have
in the warehouse

06:46.000 --> 06:48.239
is those mints that we can't sell.

06:48.240 --> 06:50.240
Now, you just said some
naughty words.

06:50.280 --> 06:52.480
I hate that. Mints?

06:52.520 --> 06:55.280
"Can't sell"!
We didn't sell the mints

06:55.320 --> 06:58.440
because of their unfortunate
side-effects.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.640
They're still in there.

07:01.680 --> 07:05.040
Maybe we ought to give them
another chance, then.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.399
At what price?

07:08.400 --> 07:10.160
You had to reduce them.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.600
They'll have forgotten
about the reduction.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.520
We'll try them again at full price.

07:20.960 --> 07:22.960
So now they're nature mints?

07:23.000 --> 07:26.279
Yes. Well, they didn't sell under
the old name so now we're going

07:26.280 --> 07:28.240
with the trend, aren't we?
We're going green.

07:30.160 --> 07:32.920
All this time
you've been a flower person.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.360
Can I ask,

07:36.400 --> 07:38.199
what the heck is a wambo?

07:38.200 --> 07:42.080
Ah, well, you would know it
when you found it.

07:44.640 --> 07:49.560
It's one of those deep-down
rare mystical moments

07:49.600 --> 07:51.720
when you realise that

07:51.760 --> 07:55.040
you are the sparkle in a dew drop.

07:56.760 --> 08:00.359
The fragment of a bird's song.

08:00.360 --> 08:03.600
The love behind the wagging
of a dog's tail.

08:04.600 --> 08:07.640
Well, if I'm part of a dog's tail,
I hope it's the far end.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.960
How are you today, Mrs Featherstone?

08:17.240 --> 08:19.240
Did you sleep well, Granville?

08:19.280 --> 08:22.479
It's not something I would ask of
a casual acquaintance,

08:22.480 --> 08:24.599
but we've had our special moments.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.120
We have?

08:27.440 --> 08:29.000
Or am I wrong?

08:29.040 --> 08:32.000
Are they still to come?

08:32.039 --> 08:34.119
I slept well, Mrs Featherstone.

08:34.120 --> 08:36.480
Alone, like me.

08:36.520 --> 08:38.280
I know the feeling.

08:38.320 --> 08:41.960
That empty side of your bed,
and mine.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.040
Acres of space to roll around in,
if you're so inclined.

08:53.760 --> 08:55.760
How are you on inclined, Granville?

08:57.160 --> 08:58.920
Devoutly single bed.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.600
Cosy. Hardly room to turn over.

09:01.640 --> 09:05.720
That's the best kind. Romance can
thrive on the tight turnover.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.359
How is Mr Newbold?

09:10.360 --> 09:12.999
Oh, I don't think of Mr Newbold
in terms of bed space.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
Not yet.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.720
The position is still open.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.680
I've got some nice broccoli.

09:23.120 --> 09:25.240
Well, if we're going into
advertising,

09:25.280 --> 09:28.640
I've got several flimsy nighties
with very little wear and tear.

09:31.360 --> 09:34.199
Despite the attention
of three husbands.

09:34.200 --> 09:37.000
They couldn't have been paying
very much attention.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.240
It wasn't encouraged.

09:39.680 --> 09:43.759
I'm sorry to say that none of them
knew how to -

09:43.760 --> 09:45.399
how shall I put this? -

09:45.400 --> 09:47.360
ignite the sacred flame.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.320
How much is your broccoli?

09:58.800 --> 10:00.160
The broccoli? Oh, yes.

10:00.200 --> 10:03.200
Broccoli. I've got plenty
of nighties, yes. Er, broccoli.

10:03.240 --> 10:06.479
Broccoli. Am I disturbing you,
Granville? Hm.

10:06.480 --> 10:10.000
Good. I'll take half a pound.
Half a pound, right.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.920
We're in kilos now.

10:11.960 --> 10:16.000
Oh, you continentals, you know how
to arouse the interest of a girl.

10:30.160 --> 10:31.280
Nature mints?

10:31.320 --> 10:33.080
You can keep your nature mints.

10:33.120 --> 10:34.480
Come in, Cyril.

10:34.520 --> 10:36.959
Bring your complaint with you.

10:36.960 --> 10:38.320
Complaint?

10:40.800 --> 10:42.400
I should think so.

10:47.360 --> 10:49.799
Good. That's good.
Now you're on the path.

10:49.800 --> 10:51.560
I'm going green.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.600
Only your tongue, but that's good.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.279
A green tongue is good?

10:55.280 --> 10:58.680
The missus won't allow me in the
bedroom. She thinks I'm radioactive.

11:01.320 --> 11:04.960
Don't worry, it'll fade
and it will disappear.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.400
What, the whole tongue?!

11:07.680 --> 11:10.319
No, no, not the whole tongue.

11:10.320 --> 11:13.680
Anyway, you should welcome
the green.

11:13.720 --> 11:15.959
You think I'm in a hurry
to be green?

11:15.960 --> 11:20.480
It's a light-green coating and it's
one of South America's most magical

11:20.520 --> 11:21.840
herbal remedies.

11:24.080 --> 11:26.039
It comes from the Amazon.

11:26.040 --> 11:29.159
It's the secret of a lost tribe.

11:29.160 --> 11:30.760
Lost in their own jungle?

11:32.400 --> 11:34.440
Is that a recommendation?

11:34.480 --> 11:40.679
If the tongue goes green, you are on
the brink of finding your wambo.

11:40.680 --> 11:42.760
And then what?
What am I to do with it?

11:44.680 --> 11:47.280
Is it something that's going
to impress the wife?

11:48.440 --> 11:50.719
How can she resist?

11:50.720 --> 11:52.480
She has ways.

11:52.520 --> 11:55.759
Stand still. Don't make a sound.

11:55.760 --> 11:57.960
I thought I could sense something.

11:59.440 --> 12:02.040
Just cup your hands behind your ears
like that.

12:02.080 --> 12:04.280
Listen hard.

12:04.320 --> 12:09.120
Sometimes enlightenment starts
with just a small squeak.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.040
DOG TOY SQUEAKS

12:16.880 --> 12:18.080
I heard that.

12:18.120 --> 12:19.520
What? A definite squeak.

12:20.960 --> 12:22.320
You didn't hear it? No.

12:22.360 --> 12:25.920
No. Only you can hear
your own wambo.

12:28.840 --> 12:32.680
It's a very personal and -
dare we say - almost magical thing.

12:33.760 --> 12:36.680
OK. One more question. Mm-hm.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.720
Will the squeak come again?

12:39.760 --> 12:42.480
It is only to the chosen.

12:42.520 --> 12:46.599
To those on the brink
of finding their wambo.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.560
I'm ready.

12:50.040 --> 12:51.400
I'm on the path.

12:53.480 --> 12:54.840
SQUEAK!

13:08.960 --> 13:11.079
So he left her, just like that.

13:11.080 --> 13:13.719
Went to Cleethorpes
in search of adventure.

13:13.720 --> 13:15.760
Well, a man has to do
what a man has to do.

13:17.240 --> 13:19.599
Did he find it? She doesn't know.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.919
He never came back.

13:21.920 --> 13:26.520
There's a rumour that
Mr Ellis's tongue has gone green.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.600
Oh, it wears off. Look.

13:28.640 --> 13:31.239
How does a tongue
wear its green off?

13:31.240 --> 13:33.040
Just... normal wear and tear.

13:34.200 --> 13:37.840
Well, if yours ever goes green
and you need any help...

13:59.080 --> 14:02.200
So I'm talking things over with
Cyril and Mr Newbold,

14:02.240 --> 14:05.159
and it's uncanny, really.

14:05.160 --> 14:08.520
We find we all have the same
secret desire.

14:09.840 --> 14:10.840
I know.

14:12.680 --> 14:16.120
All this time we've been trying to
fight off the need for adventure.

14:19.160 --> 14:22.400
Trying to ignore the urge
to test ourselves.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.840
Just in case you might be worried
about us.

14:29.520 --> 14:30.960
But it's too big to ignore.

14:32.200 --> 14:35.400
We're looking for that place where
man and his challenge

14:35.440 --> 14:37.680
become one almost
spiritual identity.

14:42.160 --> 14:43.800
Once we've sucked up the pain.

14:46.000 --> 14:49.319
I'm talking flat-out dangerous here.

14:49.320 --> 14:51.440
Mm.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.280
It's a man thing.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.520
I always knew it was for me,

14:56.560 --> 15:00.520
but it's nice how keen Cyril
and Mr Newbold are to follow me.

15:02.240 --> 15:04.240
To put their lives in my hands.

15:06.320 --> 15:07.520
I'll see they're OK.

15:11.080 --> 15:12.560
But one thing we're all agreed on.

15:14.040 --> 15:17.040
There's absolutely no way
we're letting our womenfolk

15:17.080 --> 15:19.680
talk us out of this.
Cos we are there.

15:19.720 --> 15:21.280
We are in the zone!

15:28.480 --> 15:30.479
Eric... Mm?

15:30.480 --> 15:32.680
You are so full of doo-doo.

15:36.160 --> 15:39.000
She said that
to Christopher Columbus.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.679
Who?

15:40.680 --> 15:42.760
Mrs Columbus!

15:50.920 --> 15:53.000
Yes, that's very good, Mr Lomax.

15:53.040 --> 15:54.400
Yes, that's green.

15:54.440 --> 15:55.840
Very good, yes. Good?

15:56.960 --> 15:59.359
You're finding your wambo stage one.

15:59.360 --> 16:00.559
Yes.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.160
You're going to be a natural.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.160
HE MUMBLES

16:05.200 --> 16:07.039
No, put it back in and try again.

16:07.040 --> 16:08.640
Will it wear off?

16:08.680 --> 16:10.279
Yes, of course, no problem.

16:10.280 --> 16:11.840
No problem for YOU.

16:11.880 --> 16:14.120
I've had a green tongue
since this morning.

16:14.160 --> 16:15.960
The wife daren't look.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.439
Oh, dear. My advice to you is,

16:17.440 --> 16:21.200
don't go around sticking
your tongue out at your wife.

16:21.240 --> 16:22.840
Ah, excuse me just a moment.

16:24.960 --> 16:26.920
They're turning people green again.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.760
Quick, stick your tongue out.

16:32.680 --> 16:34.240
No, not like that.

16:34.280 --> 16:35.680
Put it right out.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.280
It won't go right out.

16:37.320 --> 16:38.520
It's nervous.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.000
It's wondering what you're up to.

16:48.280 --> 16:50.160
Just a moment, Mr Lomax,
come and look at this.

16:50.200 --> 16:52.320
I'm sorry about that,
he's got a shy tongue.

16:52.360 --> 16:53.920
Look, there you can see.

16:53.960 --> 16:57.080
His tongue an hour ago was green,
but look at it now.

16:58.720 --> 17:02.760
What are we looking for? Oh,
bring your friends, why don't you?

17:02.800 --> 17:07.960
Relax! Quiet. Now...
We're looking for traces of green.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.599
Well, if you want green...

17:13.680 --> 17:15.079
You too?

17:15.079 --> 17:16.480
Nature mints?

17:16.520 --> 17:17.880
Nature mints.

17:18.960 --> 17:24.000
It'll pass, it'll wear off.
Look, look. An hour ago his tongue

17:24.040 --> 17:26.040
was green, and so was mine,

17:26.079 --> 17:28.960
but look at them now.
Look at his, look at mine.

17:42.560 --> 17:46.359
Now look what you've done.
You've lost me... Oh.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.479
You've lost me a customer.

17:48.480 --> 17:49.480
Oh, heck.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.200
Ah, Mrs Featherstone.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.280
All right, I'll get you for that.

18:10.320 --> 18:12.840
I'm glad somebody can put
the wind up you.

18:12.880 --> 18:15.440
I can handle Mrs Featherstone.

18:15.480 --> 18:17.720
Well, she keeps giving you
the opportunity.

18:17.760 --> 18:19.679
She scares you witless.

18:19.680 --> 18:21.639
No, she does not.

18:21.640 --> 18:24.959
In public,
I have to be civil to her.

18:24.960 --> 18:29.159
But if I get her alone,
I'd soon sort her out.

18:29.160 --> 18:30.640
That I'd like to see!

18:30.680 --> 18:32.880
Ah... Eh? Yes? Hm.

18:35.520 --> 18:37.759
They think we're a bunch of wusses.

18:37.760 --> 18:40.960
It's time we put a boot
through that image.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.520
Earn some respect.

18:42.560 --> 18:45.280
Let them see us at danger's edge.

18:45.320 --> 18:47.680
I just feel so damned uncomfortable.

18:49.320 --> 18:51.519
We have to eat the pain.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.360
Wear it like a badge.

18:53.400 --> 18:57.440
We've got to be awesome. We're
bonding here, I can feel it.

18:57.480 --> 19:01.959
Three guys about to tackle serious
white-water in a flimsy boat.

19:01.960 --> 19:05.639
Sorry, but I have to ask,
how is that helping me

19:05.640 --> 19:07.600
with Mrs Featherstone?

19:08.840 --> 19:10.520
Image.

19:10.560 --> 19:15.720
Aura. It's,
"Goodbye, Pussy, hello, 007."

19:15.760 --> 19:18.999
They're going to look at us with
eyes like the most devoted

19:19.000 --> 19:20.040
golden retriever.

19:21.240 --> 19:25.519
You say jump,
and Mrs Featherstone will jump.

19:25.520 --> 19:27.600
On days, when you're feeling good...

19:28.880 --> 19:30.720
..you'll throw her a bone.

19:31.800 --> 19:34.000
Where do I get a bone?

19:34.040 --> 19:35.600
She's got me on salads.

19:38.680 --> 19:42.320
Every full moon,
we grocers gather in a meadow

19:42.360 --> 19:45.200
to celebrate the lunar festivities,

19:45.240 --> 19:49.000
and to which we are allowed
to invite one maiden.

19:49.040 --> 19:51.080
Would they let me in anyway?

19:52.240 --> 19:54.720
Are you prepared to be sacrificed?

19:54.760 --> 19:56.960
Does it hurt? Only when you laugh.

19:59.440 --> 20:00.800
Are you coming?

20:00.840 --> 20:03.040
Are you going to be here all day?

20:03.080 --> 20:05.039
Have you got what you came for?

20:05.040 --> 20:09.159
I've forgotten what it was now,
with you coming in all gobby.

20:09.160 --> 20:13.079
It's him. He distracts you and then
he sells you any old rubbish.

20:13.080 --> 20:14.960
He's never diddled me yet.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.400
It remains an ambition.

20:23.800 --> 20:28.680
Who is this old lady? Do we know
this person? I know YOU.

20:28.720 --> 20:30.839
You're turning people green.

20:30.840 --> 20:34.759
I should need double mints for the
length of some people's tongues.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.399
Oh, look who's talking!

20:36.400 --> 20:39.200
You've got more rattle
than Gastric's Mini.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.480
Get a move on, you. I'll be outside.

20:43.520 --> 20:44.960
SHE HISSES

20:46.280 --> 20:47.560
I'll have to go. All right.

20:49.440 --> 20:51.000
Fish and chips later?

20:51.040 --> 20:52.520
Don't bring vinegar.

20:52.560 --> 20:54.440
Leave her at home.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.600
Oh... I just passed Madge.

21:06.240 --> 21:08.240
I went, "Hello, Madge."

21:08.280 --> 21:10.680
And she went, "Urgh."

21:10.720 --> 21:14.560
Did you smile? Of course I smiled.
I gave her my big one.

21:14.600 --> 21:18.039
Wrong move. They like misery.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.600
Tell her a sad story.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.120
Gets them every time.

21:23.440 --> 21:27.560
Your lady friend is waiting for you
round the corner in Gastric's Mini.

21:27.600 --> 21:28.959
Be gentle with her.

21:28.960 --> 21:31.200
She's on her last legs.

21:31.240 --> 21:32.599
Who, Mavis?

21:32.600 --> 21:33.760
No, the car.

21:35.400 --> 21:37.119
Who's looking after the shop?

21:37.120 --> 21:38.480
I'll mind the shop.

21:43.160 --> 21:47.600
Nobody quite says,
"Hello, Granville," like Mavis.

21:52.200 --> 21:53.760
Hello, Granville.

21:53.800 --> 21:55.200
Mrs Featherstone?

22:02.560 --> 22:04.920
We need to talk, Granville. We do.

22:04.960 --> 22:07.519
About our future. Our future?

22:07.520 --> 22:10.359
You wouldn't want to tie yourself,
would you,

22:10.360 --> 22:13.279
to someone who is clearly fading?

22:13.280 --> 22:16.920
I've buried three, Granville -
what's a fourth? Fourth? Fourth?

22:18.360 --> 22:23.400
Come along. I want to take you
and show you my favourite spot.

22:38.680 --> 22:41.719
I thought you were going to show me
your favourite spot.

22:41.720 --> 22:44.879
It's here, look,
right before your eyes.

22:44.880 --> 22:46.760
Mrs Featherstone!

22:47.840 --> 22:49.400
You've got a flat.

22:49.440 --> 22:52.240
Oh! They're not bad for my age.

22:54.320 --> 22:55.960
No, the tyre!

22:56.000 --> 22:58.080
I can hear the air escaping.

23:05.440 --> 23:09.000
I have to get back to give Leroy
his overcharging lessons.

23:10.760 --> 23:13.160
He's failed basic avarice twice.

23:14.440 --> 23:17.599
I sometimes wonder if he's going
to make it all the way.

23:17.600 --> 23:20.080
Well, YOU'VE just had
every opportunity.

23:22.280 --> 23:23.920
Good grief, is that the time?

23:50.520 --> 23:53.800
Do we really need to be checking
for leaks?

23:53.840 --> 23:56.440
Since we're not actually going near
any water.

23:56.480 --> 23:59.080
We don't have to go near any water,

23:59.120 --> 24:01.879
we just have to look
as if we're going.

24:01.880 --> 24:05.679
Act professional. We don't want to
look like a bunch of wannabes.

24:05.680 --> 24:09.040
To tell you the truth, I'm fairly
comfortable with wannabe.

24:09.080 --> 24:12.920
But we have to get the word out,
and this is the place.

24:14.160 --> 24:18.800
This is not just a shop,
this is News Central.

24:18.840 --> 24:21.200
This is where the word gets spread.

24:21.240 --> 24:22.999
It all happens here.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.680
No more ordinary days.

24:24.720 --> 24:26.280
We are Team Hazard now.

24:29.480 --> 24:31.280
What is it you keep listening for?

24:31.320 --> 24:33.000
Just listening.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.840
Oh, good day to you, Mr Willshaw.

24:46.840 --> 24:48.919
She told you, didn't she?

24:48.920 --> 24:50.680
About my robot. Well,

24:50.720 --> 24:53.960
Mrs Willshaw did say that
you were working on one.

24:54.000 --> 24:56.599
I bet you laughed. They all laugh.

24:56.600 --> 25:01.040
"Old Willshaw's building a robot.
Ha-ha-ha. He-he."

25:01.080 --> 25:03.680
Yes, well, we'll see who laughs.

25:06.960 --> 25:09.400
It comes around corners on command.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.679
What's it doing round there?

25:15.680 --> 25:18.640
I hope you haven't programmed it
to shoplift, have you?

25:18.680 --> 25:21.520
No, no, no. I'm not saying
I couldn't,

25:21.560 --> 25:23.799
but, relax, Elvis is honest.

25:23.800 --> 25:27.040
Elvis? I've called it Elvis.

25:27.080 --> 25:32.520
Now, watch this. I've trained Elvis
to respond to voice commands.

25:32.560 --> 25:34.120
Oh, good.

25:34.160 --> 25:36.640
Elvis! Come.

25:36.680 --> 25:38.120
BUZZING AND WHIRRING

25:40.800 --> 25:42.280
WHIRRING STOPS

25:42.320 --> 25:44.920
You have to get the voice
just right.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.920
Ah, right.

25:46.960 --> 25:49.560
Elvis! Come.

25:49.600 --> 25:51.400
WHIRRING

25:58.560 --> 26:00.560
You said you weren't
going to do this.

26:05.880 --> 26:07.279
Just needs a tweak.

26:07.280 --> 26:09.280
Oh, right, of course. Yeah.

26:15.560 --> 26:16.759
Excuse me. Hang about.

26:16.760 --> 26:19.240
What's this, the fleet's in?

26:19.280 --> 26:21.720
This is an adventure craft.

26:22.760 --> 26:24.520
It's part of our new image.

26:24.560 --> 26:27.480
We're putting our lives on the line
in this.

26:27.520 --> 26:29.480
Hence the silly costumes.

26:35.520 --> 26:38.320
Now, where are you going with it
anyway?

26:38.360 --> 26:40.799
To the limit.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.559
And to the zone.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.200
We've trained for this.

26:44.240 --> 26:46.040
We're at the peak.

26:50.560 --> 26:52.160
Hello, sailor.

26:53.600 --> 26:55.839
I can't stop. Danger calls.

26:55.840 --> 26:58.040
Where do you think you're going
dressed like that?

26:58.080 --> 26:59.880
To the limit.
Not with me, you're not.

26:59.920 --> 27:01.920
Not till we've completed
the paperwork.

27:01.960 --> 27:04.520
Now, lift, come on,
get this thing out of here!

27:04.560 --> 27:06.039
Take all this...

27:06.040 --> 27:08.920
HISSING

27:13.480 --> 27:15.800
It's alive! Help! Help!

27:15.840 --> 27:18.200
Mind your head!

27:20.640 --> 27:23.240
THEY SHOUT AND YELL

27:27.920 --> 27:30.000
HISSING

27:36.880 --> 27:39.280
'Oh, that Mrs Featherstone
really knows

27:39.320 --> 27:42.120
'how to deflate the men around here.

27:49.240 --> 27:51.479
'The Black Widow in a Mini.

27:51.480 --> 27:53.239
'Ugh.

27:53.240 --> 27:55.320
'I'll never get rid of that image.

27:59.840 --> 28:01.600
'Oh, I tell a lie.

28:01.640 --> 28:03.240
'It's fading already.'

28:04.520 --> 28:08.920
I thought we might go somewhere
and see if we can find OUR wambo.

28:08.960 --> 28:12.160
Well, if you just wait until
I can get rid of this stuff,

28:12.200 --> 28:15.340
I think I can remember
exactly where we left it.
