WEBVTT

00:08.469 --> 00:10.551
That's the last few.
Everybody's safe,

00:10.551 --> 00:13.804
- including one very
ungrateful grizzly.
- [bear growls]

00:13.804 --> 00:15.846
Oh, shut it!

00:15.846 --> 00:18.729
Fire Department can
handle things from here.

00:18.729 --> 00:20.141
Great work, guys.

00:20.141 --> 00:23.194
[cheering]

00:23.194 --> 00:24.855
Ah, life is so much better

00:24.855 --> 00:26.947
now we don't have
to keep our missions a secret.

00:26.947 --> 00:29.740
I know. Now people can
tell us how great we are

00:29.740 --> 00:31.152
right to our faces.

00:31.152 --> 00:33.074
[all] Adam, Bree
and Chase.

00:33.074 --> 00:35.035
Adam, Bree and Chase.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.787
Are you kidding me?

00:36.787 --> 00:38.619
I've been going on missions
for over a month.

00:38.619 --> 00:40.831
How can these people
not know my name?

00:40.831 --> 00:44.044
Maybe you should change it to
something people won't forget,

00:44.044 --> 00:46.877
like, uh,
Gregorio Spiridakis,

00:46.877 --> 00:48.669
or Pickles O'Malley.

00:51.512 --> 00:54.805
Can I have
your attention, please?

00:54.805 --> 00:56.807
I'd like to point out
that Adam, Bree and Chase

00:56.807 --> 00:57.978
weren't the only heroes.

00:57.978 --> 01:01.102
I personally saved
six people.

01:01.102 --> 01:04.235
Adam, Bree, Chase,
and that guy.

01:04.235 --> 01:06.947
Adam, Bree,
Chase, and that guy.

01:06.947 --> 01:09.490
[chanting continues]

01:09.490 --> 01:10.611
All right,
the six I saved,

01:10.611 --> 01:12.113
back in the fire.

01:14.455 --> 01:16.957
The world's first
bionic superhumans.

01:16.957 --> 01:18.659
They're stronger than us.

01:18.659 --> 01:21.622
Faster.
Smarter.

01:21.622 --> 01:24.004
The next generation
of the human race is...

01:24.004 --> 01:26.046
living on a bionic island.

02:02.583 --> 02:04.875
So long story short,

02:04.875 --> 02:07.878
Donnie put me in charge
of developing technology

02:07.878 --> 02:09.550
for the academy.

02:09.550 --> 02:11.922
But only on
a trial basis.

02:11.922 --> 02:15.466
Why just a trial basis?

02:15.466 --> 02:17.888
I honestly don't know.

02:17.888 --> 02:21.852
You tried to annihilate
his whole family.

02:21.852 --> 02:25.316
Come on, you met him.
Can you blame me?

02:25.316 --> 02:27.568
Don't worry, big guy.

02:27.568 --> 02:29.900
I'm sure you'll
wipe him out next time.

02:29.900 --> 02:32.653
The point is,

02:32.653 --> 02:35.776
I have the chance
to get back into
my brother's good graces.

02:35.776 --> 02:38.699
So I've been working on
some new devices

02:38.699 --> 02:40.871
that are really
going to impress Donnie.

02:40.871 --> 02:42.993
What do you guys
wanna see first?

02:42.993 --> 02:44.875
The Stabber 2000?

02:44.875 --> 02:47.248
Plague in a bottle?
Uh-oh.

02:47.248 --> 02:50.211
Here comes
the pencil bazooka.

02:50.211 --> 02:52.343
[chuckling]
You can't erase

02:52.343 --> 02:55.636
the injuries
this thing will cause.

02:55.636 --> 02:58.469
How would any of those
be used at the academy?

02:58.469 --> 03:00.641
How should I know?

03:00.641 --> 03:02.102
This one
with the questions.

03:05.566 --> 03:07.398
Look, Douglas.
Big D. doesn't want
violent devices.

03:07.398 --> 03:09.770
He wants things that are
going to improve our lives.

03:09.770 --> 03:13.944
I don't know if that's
really in my wheelhouse.

03:13.944 --> 03:16.737
I have been destroying things
for years,

03:16.737 --> 03:19.530
and now I'm
supposed to help people?

03:20.781 --> 03:23.534
Where did my life
go so wrong?

03:24.915 --> 03:27.538
Come on, Douglas.
You must have something.

03:27.538 --> 03:29.500
Well...

03:29.500 --> 03:31.502
Maybe this'll work.

03:31.502 --> 03:34.835
Ooh, Italian furniture.
I approve.

03:34.835 --> 03:36.176
No!

03:36.176 --> 03:38.719
It's my lie detector chair.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.761
Ya strap somebody
into it,

03:40.761 --> 03:42.142
and ask 'em questions.

03:42.142 --> 03:44.555
It analyzes
their vocal patterns,

03:44.555 --> 03:46.607
and determines if
they're telling the truth.

03:46.607 --> 03:48.729
I like it.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.522
But do you have anything
in a lie-detecting hammock?

03:51.522 --> 03:53.774
Just try it out.

03:53.774 --> 03:55.986
Don't mind if I do.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.738
Wait. This thing's not
gonna zap me

03:57.738 --> 03:59.530
if I tell a lie,
is it?

03:59.530 --> 04:01.782
- No.
- Okay, good.

04:01.782 --> 04:04.745
It'll spin you around
in speeds up to Mach 3.

04:04.745 --> 04:07.628
- What?!
- It's like a merry-go-round

04:07.628 --> 04:10.631
with a horribly
violent twist.

04:10.631 --> 04:13.504
On second thought,
I'm late for class.

04:13.504 --> 04:16.005
- [chair buzzes]
- [Bob screams]

04:20.380 --> 04:22.222
Are you okay?

04:22.222 --> 04:26.016
Yeah.
I feel great.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.768
- [chair buzzes]
- [Bob screams]

04:33.524 --> 04:36.737
You keep me in this thing,
I'm definitely gonna ruin it.

04:38.238 --> 04:41.452
So, what do
you guys think?

04:41.452 --> 04:44.244
I think you need
to start looking for
a new job.

04:45.456 --> 04:48.288
Your inventions
shouldn't hurt the students.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.671
Ugh. Why does
this school

04:50.671 --> 04:53.414
always have to be
about the kids?

04:54.675 --> 04:57.007
Hey, Leo, we got
a mission alert.

04:57.007 --> 04:58.839
You wanna come
and not get noticed?

05:00.090 --> 05:01.842
Hey, can we go, too?

05:01.842 --> 05:04.925
Sorry, kid. You're still
not mission-ready yet.

05:12.142 --> 05:15.526
Man, they're never
gonna give me a chance.

05:15.526 --> 05:17.147
Don't let it bother you.

05:17.147 --> 05:18.439
I think you're
mission-ready.

05:18.439 --> 05:20.240
- [chair buzzes]
- [Bob screams]

05:21.442 --> 05:23.654
Ooh. Ouch.

05:23.654 --> 05:26.657
Right on
the Stabber 2000.

05:29.950 --> 05:32.713
We got a mission alert
from this address, ma'am.

05:32.713 --> 05:33.954
What's the emergency?

05:33.954 --> 05:37.758
And don't panic, because
Adam, Chase and Leo are here.

05:38.759 --> 05:41.842
My cat, Colonel Cuddles,
ran up this tree.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.344
Can you please
get him down?

05:44.344 --> 05:46.967
I don't think it classifies
as a mission

05:46.967 --> 05:50.310
if we can be replaced
by a ladder.

05:50.310 --> 05:52.893
I mean, seriously, we're
rescuing a cat from a tree?

05:52.893 --> 05:57.688
No. We're rescuing
a raccoon from a tree.

05:57.688 --> 06:01.151
Aw, cute. He's chewing on
that sleeping squirrel.

06:03.073 --> 06:04.745
[alarm beeping]

06:04.745 --> 06:08.449
Guys, I just got
five new mission alerts.

06:08.449 --> 06:13.043
Sounds like five more
opportunities for
this guy to be a hero.

06:13.043 --> 06:15.205
This guy? I thought
you were that guy.

06:15.205 --> 06:16.997
Make up your mind.

06:16.997 --> 06:18.549
Come on, let's go!

06:18.549 --> 06:20.921
Wait. What about my cat?

06:20.921 --> 06:22.593
It's at your feet, ma'am,

06:22.593 --> 06:23.964
where it's been
the whole time.

06:23.964 --> 06:25.766
- [meows]
- Oh.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.394
Fifteen straight missions,

06:34.394 --> 06:35.976
and not one
real emergency.

06:35.976 --> 06:38.228
What a waste of
my immense talent

06:38.228 --> 06:40.190
and unique skill set.

06:40.190 --> 06:42.983
Yeah. I don't know
which mission was more annoying,

06:42.983 --> 06:44.525
the lady who
ran out of gas,

06:44.525 --> 06:47.327
or the guy who didn't know
which side dish to order.

06:47.327 --> 06:49.620
I do. The lady
who ran out of gas.

06:49.620 --> 06:52.833
I had to watch her
push her car for two miles.

06:52.833 --> 06:57.588
Guys, I feel proud
to spend time with
our adoring public.

06:57.588 --> 06:59.840
Now if you'll excuse me,
America's newest bionic hero

06:59.840 --> 07:01.251
is about to get busy
with some baby grapes.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.095
I don't get it.

07:05.095 --> 07:07.718
How did all those people
know how to contact us?

07:07.718 --> 07:09.640
It's easy. You just touch
a bunch of numbers

07:09.640 --> 07:11.221
until someone says hello.

07:16.056 --> 07:19.730
Guys, I think I know
what's going on. Look.

07:22.112 --> 07:24.324
How could he do that?

07:24.324 --> 07:26.527
Well, there's a printer,
there's a copy shop.

07:26.527 --> 07:29.740
A ton of places online.

07:29.740 --> 07:31.702
Ah, the life of
a bionic hero.

07:31.702 --> 07:33.283
Am I right, people?

07:33.283 --> 07:36.286
Yeah. Nothing says
bionic hero

07:36.286 --> 07:39.129
like cheap business cards.

07:39.129 --> 07:40.841
They had to be cheap.

07:40.841 --> 07:43.714
How else was I supposed
to afford 10,000 of them?

07:43.714 --> 07:46.547
Why would you do this?

07:46.547 --> 07:49.469
I just wanted people to know
I was part of the team.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.142
Did they airbrush
your biceps?

07:52.142 --> 07:54.224
No.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.056
I did.

07:56.056 --> 07:59.309
This was
a terrible idea, Leo.

07:59.309 --> 08:02.523
Relax. It's just a few
little business cards.

08:02.523 --> 08:05.736
Look. My commercial's on.

08:05.736 --> 08:08.278
Hello. My name
is Leo Dooley.

08:08.278 --> 08:10.741
Are you the victim
of an accident or
terrible disaster?

08:10.741 --> 08:13.874
If so, great.
I can help.

08:13.874 --> 08:15.576
That's me.

08:15.576 --> 08:18.749
I'm Leo Dooley.

08:18.749 --> 08:22.172
My bionic team can solve
any life-threatening situation.

08:22.172 --> 08:24.004
And remember
the Leo Dooley promise.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.626
If I don't
save your life,

08:25.626 --> 08:28.298
your next mission
is free.

08:28.298 --> 08:30.681
Call now.

08:30.681 --> 08:32.972
Not responsible for
any injuries caused

08:32.972 --> 08:35.345
during actual rescue.

08:35.345 --> 08:37.437
Leo, I can't believe
you did that.

08:37.437 --> 08:39.690
I can't believe no one told me
we were charging for missions.

08:39.690 --> 08:41.231
Where's my cut?

08:41.231 --> 08:45.696
We don't charge
for missions.

08:45.696 --> 08:47.738
- Do we?
- No.

08:47.738 --> 08:51.111
Leo, that is not cool.

08:51.111 --> 08:52.743
Relax.

08:52.743 --> 08:54.785
It's just
one little commercial,

08:54.785 --> 08:56.116
and it's only run once.

08:56.116 --> 08:58.118
Hola. Me llamo
Leo Dooley.

09:02.753 --> 09:05.215
Hey, how's it goin'?

09:05.215 --> 09:08.378
Invent anything for
the academy that won't
scar us for life?

09:08.378 --> 09:11.301
It's all still
too dangerous.

09:11.301 --> 09:13.173
The safest thing
I've got

09:13.173 --> 09:14.675
is this nerve gas.

09:14.675 --> 09:16.637
It only eats
half your brain.

09:18.679 --> 09:20.731
Let's put a pin
in that one.

09:20.731 --> 09:24.685
Hey, maybe we can help you
come up with something else.

09:24.685 --> 09:26.066
Oh, I know.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.948
A metal box that
heats up bread,

09:27.948 --> 09:29.990
and makes it crispy
so you can put butter on it.

09:29.990 --> 09:32.362
It's called a toaster, Bob.

09:32.362 --> 09:35.245
It was invented
150 years ago.

09:35.245 --> 09:37.367
How about a machine
that takes you

09:37.367 --> 09:40.290
- from the first floor
to the second?
- Elevator.

09:40.290 --> 09:43.043
- Then how about
stairs that move?
- Escalator.

09:43.043 --> 09:46.166
- Stairs that don't move.
- Stairs, Bob!

09:47.587 --> 09:49.089
I have one for you.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.761
How about a machine

09:50.761 --> 09:53.263
that gets rid of all
the things that drive you crazy?

09:53.263 --> 09:55.595
Ooh, I like it.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.718
- What's it called?
- A hydraloop.

09:59.429 --> 10:01.642
No, wait!

10:03.894 --> 10:06.687
He'll be back.

10:06.687 --> 10:08.689
He always comes back.

10:14.154 --> 10:16.156
[beeping]

10:16.156 --> 10:18.739
We've got mission alerts
coming in from all
across the country.

10:18.739 --> 10:20.661
There's no way
we can handle 'em all.

10:20.661 --> 10:23.794
I told you we should've
opened up a Canadian branch.

10:23.794 --> 10:25.625
Great.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.668
Now that you added
a phone number to the system,

10:27.668 --> 10:30.590
the whole world has
direct access to us.

10:30.590 --> 10:32.252
That's right.

10:32.252 --> 10:33.804
Worldwide, baby.

10:33.804 --> 10:37.758
We have no way to differentiate
between a real emergency

10:37.758 --> 10:40.220
and some guy who can't find
one of his shoes.

10:40.220 --> 10:41.762
I'm sorry;
I panicked.

10:41.762 --> 10:44.644
Next time, I'll check
my feet first.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.477
Okay, well, what are we
gonna do?

10:47.477 --> 10:50.610
I bet most of these
alerts aren't even for
legitimate missions.

10:50.610 --> 10:52.152
We don't have a choice.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.694
We have to ignore
some of them,

10:53.694 --> 10:54.825
and let the local
authorities handle it.

10:54.825 --> 10:56.616
You can't do that.

10:56.616 --> 10:58.618
I made a promise
to help people,

10:58.618 --> 11:00.620
in two languages,

11:00.620 --> 11:02.783
and I'm working on a third
for my Chinese friends.

11:03.954 --> 11:05.836
When people call in
a mission alert,

11:05.836 --> 11:08.378
they expect
Leo Dooley to show up.

11:08.378 --> 11:11.551
But with bigger biceps.

11:11.551 --> 11:14.674
Or biceps.

11:14.674 --> 11:18.058
That's the sixth
false alarm from
Highland Hills today.

11:18.058 --> 11:19.679
Sorry, Leo.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.601
Fool me once,
shame on you.

11:21.601 --> 11:24.064
Fool me four, five, six times,
I'm stayin' home.

11:25.475 --> 11:27.267
So you're just gonna
blow it off?

11:27.267 --> 11:29.770
We have to.
We don't have the manpower.

11:29.770 --> 11:31.611
Then I guess I'm going
to Highland Hills alone.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.866
I better hurry.
That place is scary after dark.

11:37.367 --> 11:38.949
Hey, if anything
goes wrong,

11:38.949 --> 11:41.491
you can always call
the guy with the big biceps,

11:41.491 --> 11:43.954
but, uh, prepare
to be disappointed.

11:49.920 --> 11:51.752
Oh, I got one.

11:51.752 --> 11:54.044
A machine that pumps
cold air into a hot room.

11:54.044 --> 11:56.927
Air conditioner, Bob.

11:56.927 --> 11:59.760
And I'm also not
gonna invent
the automobile,

11:59.760 --> 12:02.302
aluminum siding,
or beef stew!

12:02.302 --> 12:04.845
Then what are we
even doing here?

12:05.976 --> 12:08.188
I told you
he'd be back.

12:10.150 --> 12:12.402
He keeps this up,

12:12.402 --> 12:14.815
I'm goin' back
to the dark side.

12:14.815 --> 12:17.527
Take me with you.

12:19.029 --> 12:20.911
[beeping]

12:20.911 --> 12:23.784
Whoa, look at
all those mission alerts.

12:23.784 --> 12:26.246
The system's
really backing up.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.998
We better answer some.

12:27.998 --> 12:29.830
What do we do?

12:29.830 --> 12:32.002
Just pick up the calls,
ask what's wrong,

12:32.002 --> 12:33.373
and try to help.

12:33.373 --> 12:35.465
Mission Alert Central.

12:35.465 --> 12:36.927
Spin speaking.

12:36.927 --> 12:38.338
How can I help you?

12:41.341 --> 12:42.762
What, Bob?

12:42.762 --> 12:44.644
When do we go on break?

12:51.691 --> 12:53.814
[people screaming]

12:53.814 --> 12:56.446
I knew it.
This is a legit mission.

12:57.988 --> 12:59.609
Don't panic. I'm gonna
get you out of there.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.533
But you already knew that
since you called me.

13:08.118 --> 13:09.409
Okay, I got you.

13:13.003 --> 13:15.125
See? Piece of cake.

13:15.125 --> 13:17.337
All right, let's
focus on...

13:23.723 --> 13:26.346
That was close.
It's okay, I've got you.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.142
[Leo screaming]

13:34.604 --> 13:36.526
Yes, that was
a girl's scream,

13:36.526 --> 13:37.898
but it was a confident
girl's scream.

13:39.109 --> 13:40.820
[shrieking]

13:42.822 --> 13:44.404
That one was not.

13:52.913 --> 13:55.665
[people screaming]

13:55.665 --> 13:57.667
I'm gonna call for help.

13:59.799 --> 14:02.762
What's our number,
what's our number,
what's our number?

14:02.762 --> 14:05.515
My business cards.

14:13.733 --> 14:15.685
My business cards!

14:19.859 --> 14:22.692
Don't worry, ma'am,
your hamster's gonna be fine.

14:22.692 --> 14:24.534
Please hold.

14:24.534 --> 14:27.157
How do you get a hamster
out of a sheep dog?

14:28.748 --> 14:30.750
I'd be happy
to pick you up, sir.

14:30.750 --> 14:33.914
Just wait at baggage claim
till I learn how to drive.

14:33.914 --> 14:36.496
Bionic Academy
mission alert line.

14:36.496 --> 14:38.088
How can I help you?

14:38.088 --> 14:40.710
Bob, it's Leo.
I need help.

14:40.710 --> 14:43.924
No problem. Can I place you
on a brief 20-minute hold?

14:43.924 --> 14:45.845
No. I'm dangling from--

14:45.845 --> 14:48.678
Thank you, and enjoy
this awful music.

14:48.678 --> 14:51.681
This is ridiculous.

14:54.774 --> 14:56.776
Well, I've never been
to the Caribbean,

14:56.776 --> 14:59.359
but I'd go with
the half-day snorkel adventure

14:59.359 --> 15:01.481
over the paddleboard
excursion.

15:01.481 --> 15:03.823
You know what I say?
You dump him.

15:03.823 --> 15:06.236
You are
an independent woman.

15:06.236 --> 15:08.578
You go, girlfriend.

15:08.578 --> 15:11.201
I am done racing
all over the country

15:11.201 --> 15:13.623
for meaningless missions.

15:13.623 --> 15:15.245
And I'm done
explaining to people

15:15.245 --> 15:17.167
why I'm not the Spanish
kid in the commercial.

15:19.749 --> 15:22.092
Are you kidding me?
More alerts?

15:22.092 --> 15:25.045
We're answering
as many as we can.

15:25.045 --> 15:26.967
Come on, Adam.
We better go tell Bree

15:26.967 --> 15:29.599
to grab some more gear
before we head back out.

15:29.599 --> 15:32.262
Adam, we have
way too many calls coming in.

15:32.262 --> 15:33.643
Can you take some?

15:33.643 --> 15:35.935
Can I do a phony accent?

15:35.935 --> 15:37.817
Sure. But heads up.

15:37.817 --> 15:41.361
Nobody's buying
Mr. Finkelschmidt
from Germany.

15:41.361 --> 15:42.732
Watch this.

15:42.732 --> 15:44.824
[bad German accent]
Hello. This is Mr. Finkelschmidt

15:44.824 --> 15:47.827
from right outside
of Germany.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.780
How may I help you?

15:50.780 --> 15:52.242
Adam, it's Leo.

15:52.242 --> 15:53.873
I'm holding onto
a helicopter

15:53.873 --> 15:55.415
so it doesn't fall off
of the side of a building.

15:55.415 --> 15:56.836
Leo, no personal calls.

15:56.836 --> 15:58.838
This line's for
emergencies only.

15:58.838 --> 16:01.251
No, don't hang up.
My phone's about to die.

16:01.251 --> 16:02.962
[frustrated scream]

16:06.296 --> 16:09.469
Does anyone mind
holding onto this helicopter

16:09.469 --> 16:11.551
so I can go grab
my phone?

16:14.644 --> 16:16.556
Come on, Adam,
we have to go.

16:16.556 --> 16:18.648
Hold on.
Can I take a real call?

16:18.648 --> 16:20.230
The only one I've had
so far was Leo.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.152
Leo called
the emergency line?

16:22.152 --> 16:24.654
Something about
a helicopter

16:24.654 --> 16:26.236
hangin' off
the side of a building.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.487
Blah, blah, blah.

16:29.659 --> 16:31.281
Hello, this is Adam.
How can I help you?

16:31.281 --> 16:33.493
He must really
be in trouble. Let's go.

16:33.493 --> 16:36.746
I'll be right there.
I'm dealing with
an emergency too.

16:40.120 --> 16:42.542
I am so sorry your flight
was canceled, ma'am.

16:42.542 --> 16:45.925
Do you mind if we
reroute you through
Salt Lake City?

16:49.929 --> 16:52.262
Help!

16:52.262 --> 16:54.974
Adam, you get Leo.
I'll stabilize the helicopter.

17:00.140 --> 17:02.642
- Got him.
- Bree, get the passengers.

17:08.778 --> 17:09.819
Hurry.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.784
That's everyone.
Let me make sure
no one's left in there.

17:14.784 --> 17:17.787
No. Bree, don't!
It's about to go over.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.460
Help. My suit is stuck.

17:21.921 --> 17:25.044
- Help!
- No! Bree!

17:35.845 --> 17:36.976
Nice work, Leo.

17:36.976 --> 17:39.058
What about
the helicopter?

17:44.354 --> 17:46.646
Yeah, that's never
gonna fly again.

17:49.819 --> 17:52.782
- Great work, guys.
- Yeah, especially you, Leo.

17:52.782 --> 17:54.904
- I owe you one.
- Yeah, well, I am a hero.

17:54.904 --> 17:57.907
- Don't push it.
- You're welcome.

17:57.907 --> 18:01.411
Hey, Leo, looks like
everyone's gonna
know your name now.

18:01.411 --> 18:03.583
That news crew
filmed the whole thing.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.626
- Who cares?
- Cares?

18:06.626 --> 18:08.208
All you've wanted
this whole time

18:08.208 --> 18:09.629
is for people
to know your name.

18:09.629 --> 18:11.421
Yeah, well...

18:11.421 --> 18:14.634
I did some thinking while I was
on hold for 20 minutes.

18:16.055 --> 18:18.718
You don't go on missions
for the fame.

18:18.718 --> 18:19.979
You go to save lives.

18:19.979 --> 18:21.771
Um, Leo, you do realize

18:21.771 --> 18:24.484
there's a 40-foot billboard
on that building

18:24.484 --> 18:26.105
with your face on it.

18:30.029 --> 18:32.192
Oh.

18:32.192 --> 18:34.784
They told me that wouldn't
be ready for another two weeks.

18:41.080 --> 18:44.664
So after hearing about
what you guys went through,

18:44.664 --> 18:46.706
I finally figured out
what I should invent.

18:46.706 --> 18:49.709
Oh, a layer of clothing
that acts as a barrier

18:49.709 --> 18:51.671
between you
and your pants.

18:53.423 --> 18:55.255
They have that, Bob.

18:55.255 --> 18:57.807
And why don't you
know about it?

18:59.719 --> 19:02.682
I took the lie detector
technology,

19:02.682 --> 19:05.605
and integrated it with
the mission alert system.

19:05.605 --> 19:08.768
Now it will analyze
the callers' vocal patterns,

19:08.768 --> 19:11.321
and determine if it's
a real emergency.

19:11.321 --> 19:12.862
This is great, Douglas.

19:12.862 --> 19:14.614
Big D.'s gonna be
very impressed.

19:14.614 --> 19:17.907
Well, I can't take
all the credit.

19:17.907 --> 19:21.201
These guys helped.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.913
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.875
They had tons
of good ideas.

19:25.875 --> 19:27.707
And I'll bet you
would like to hear

19:27.707 --> 19:29.749
every single
one of them.

19:30.750 --> 19:33.883
Bob, why don't you start?

19:33.883 --> 19:36.506
Okay, get this.

19:36.506 --> 19:38.678
It's a machine that sucks up
all the dirt on the floor.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.890
That's a vacuum cleaner.

19:40.890 --> 19:43.723
Yes, that's the perfect
name for it.

19:44.644 --> 19:46.936
Enjoy the next
six hours, Leo.

19:48.768 --> 19:52.522
How about a light source
in a stick that lets you
see at night?

19:52.522 --> 19:54.314
You mean a flashlight?

19:54.314 --> 19:56.696
No. Sounds stupid.

19:58.318 --> 20:01.411
Hey, Bob, you wanna help me
test out the pencil bazooka?

20:01.411 --> 20:02.782
- Sure.
- Great. You're the target.

20:02.782 --> 20:05.204
No, no!
