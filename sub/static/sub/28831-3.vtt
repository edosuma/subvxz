00:01.250 --> 00:03.050
   -For what?

00:03.080 --> 00:04.920
 -Hurting you.
 -I should have fought for you.

00:04.950 --> 00:06.220
I know you're seeing jamie.

00:06.250 --> 00:08.950
If you have any doubts
that he's the guy for you...

00:08.990 --> 00:10.890
        Callie:
        Yeah, jamie and I
        are on a break.

00:11.890 --> 00:12.960
Oh. Oops.

00:12.990 --> 00:14.220
     Malika:
     <i> Who's arms do you want</i>
     <i> around you?</i>

00:14.260 --> 00:16.160
 Gotta say, gael,your new piece
 might be myfavorite.

00:16.200 --> 00:17.930
    <i> You did that last night?</i>

00:17.960 --> 00:19.830
     So, I recently came out
     to myparents.

00:19.870 --> 00:22.100
       <i> They're fine</i>
       <i> with me being gay,</i>

00:22.130 --> 00:24.840
   as long as I'm not too gay.

00:24.870 --> 00:26.240
     There's something I want to
     talk to you about.

00:26.270 --> 00:29.910
I'm thinking of changing
my pronouns to they/them.

00:29.940 --> 00:31.140
          Hey, have you ever had
          sex at work before?

00:31.180 --> 00:32.280
               I saw evan leave.

00:33.880 --> 00:35.980
      Evan:
      <i> Angela, can I speak</i>
      <i> with you? In private.</i>

00:36.020 --> 00:38.180
     I think we should implement
     a rule that supervisors

00:38.220 --> 00:40.220
           cannot date anyone
           who works under them.

00:40.250 --> 00:41.190
             All:
             Agreed.

00:41.220 --> 00:43.050
    Malika:
    A letter from our father.

00:43.090 --> 00:45.190
      I wonder where he is.
      If he's still inside?

00:45.220 --> 00:46.290
         Yo, who cares?

00:46.330 --> 00:48.990
 We don't know him,
 and he doesn't want to know us.

00:49.030 --> 00:51.030
We don't need to go
looking for more pain
and disappointment.

00:51.060 --> 00:53.860
       -So, you're trans?
       -I just like to be
       upfront about it.

00:53.900 --> 00:55.100
Free tomorrow night?

00:55.130 --> 00:57.070
 -I'm kind of behind on rent.
 -Shouldn't you ask mom or dad?

00:57.100 --> 00:58.940
      -You know that's not
      an option for me.

00:58.970 --> 01:00.200
If they knew that
you were in trouble?

01:00.240 --> 01:01.210
    I don't want their help.

01:01.240 --> 01:03.910
             I'm done tolerating
             intolerant people!

01:07.280 --> 01:09.050

01:16.020 --> 01:18.120

01:37.080 --> 01:40.140

   <i> to live out loud and proud</i>

01:40.180 --> 01:44.280
   <i> in their true genders,</i>
   <i> and owning their sexuality,</i>

01:44.320 --> 01:47.150

       (chuckles)
       <i> so bold, you know?</i>

01:55.900 --> 01:58.160
    <i> Meanwhile, I'm terrified</i>
    <i> of making choices.</i>

01:58.200 --> 01:59.930
      <i> And forget about</i>

        <i> I let people walk</i>

02:05.170 --> 02:07.940
   <i> so, when are we going to</i>

02:09.009 --> 02:11.180
                  She is a they?

02:11.210 --> 02:14.180
And we told you
no short hair.

02:16.280 --> 02:18.220
      Uh, she's out of town
      on business.

02:18.250 --> 02:20.050
      But I'll let you know
      when she gets back.

02:20.090 --> 02:22.290
     -I gotta go. Love you.
     -Joey: Hey.

02:22.320 --> 02:23.990
         -Who was that?
         -Just my mom.

02:24.020 --> 02:25.960
You know moms,
blah blah blah.

02:28.230 --> 02:32.200
    Um, are you using those?

02:32.230 --> 02:35.300
       <i> My girlfriend--</i>
       <i> uh, excuse me.</i>
       <i> No, my they-friend</i>

02:35.330 --> 02:39.000
 <i> just changed their pronoun</i>
 <i> from "her-she" to "they-them".</i>

02:39.040 --> 02:42.970
     <i> Which blows my mind,</i>
     <i> cause I'm not even sure</i>
     <i> who "I-me" is,</i>

02:43.010 --> 02:46.010
     <i> -and... I get groupons.</i>

    Beta test for act-ivism,
    wouldn't miss it.

02:58.960 --> 03:01.060
         Well, I know how
         you feel about parties.

03:01.090 --> 03:02.890
They're not so bad
when you're at them.

03:05.870 --> 03:07.830
      <i> Anyway, I guess what</i>
      <i> I'm saying,</i>

03:07.870 --> 03:10.830
  <i> uh, besides the fact</i>
  <i> that I clearly need therapy,</i>

03:10.870 --> 03:13.200
  <i> um, that it's- it's an honor</i>

03:13.240 --> 03:15.210

04:00.920 --> 04:02.950
so I met with my board
of directors today

04:02.990 --> 04:04.860
and I told them all about
your app.

04:04.890 --> 04:07.120
And they were surprised
that we were wasting
our time and resources

04:07.160 --> 04:08.930
on act-ivism.

04:08.960 --> 04:10.160
          Well, that's not good.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.030
           No, it is.

04:12.060 --> 04:14.800
That's how much
I believe in you.

04:18.899 --> 04:20.899
    (gasps)
    oh, it's the group dance.

04:22.170 --> 04:23.910
   It's a <i> quinceanera</i> tradition.

04:23.940 --> 04:24.910
                           Whoo!

06:17.290 --> 06:19.790
      (cheering, applause)

06:22.090 --> 06:23.790
                   are you okay?

06:23.830 --> 06:26.130
          -Yeah.
          -Did I suck?

06:26.170 --> 06:29.130
    -No. You were funny.
    -Jazmin: <i> I served in the</i>
    <i> army for six years.</i>

06:29.170 --> 06:32.040
     <i> I fought in afghanistan</i>
     <i> and iraq.</i>

06:32.070 --> 06:34.140
     <i> But the hardest battle</i>
     <i> of my life</i>

06:34.170 --> 06:36.270
    <i> was for my own identity.</i>

06:36.310 --> 06:38.940
    (indistinct conversation)

06:38.980 --> 06:40.880
       (muffled laughter)

06:40.910 --> 06:43.980
and what about when you
ate all the <i> arroz con leche?</i>

06:44.020 --> 06:46.080
         -Before dinner.
         -I did not.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.250
   <i> Venga, amigo.</i> I caught you
   in the kitchen

06:48.290 --> 06:49.990
       with your face
       covered in canela.

06:50.020 --> 06:52.860

06:52.890 --> 06:54.020
       (speaking spanish)

06:55.130 --> 06:56.230
       (speaking spanish)

06:56.260 --> 06:58.930
    okay, fine, but it wasn't
    just me. Jazmin helped.

07:01.070 --> 07:02.170
         (adriana sighs)

07:02.200 --> 07:04.770
okay...

07:04.800 --> 07:06.170
       (speaking spanish)

07:06.210 --> 07:07.800
              (speaking spanish)

07:11.140 --> 07:12.840
         is this how it's always
         gonna be?

07:14.710 --> 07:16.080
   I mention jazmin and everyone
   just gets quiet

07:16.120 --> 07:17.780
    and changes the subject?

07:17.820 --> 07:19.780
(speaking spanish)

07:19.820 --> 07:22.050
        we always celebrated
        your birthdays together.

07:23.890 --> 07:25.860
  How many celebrations
  are we gonna leave her out of?

07:25.890 --> 07:27.860
             -Gael.
             -<i> Caf</i> ?

07:27.890 --> 07:29.960
       (speaking spanish)

07:31.260 --> 07:34.060
            okay, fine. We won't
            talk about her,

07:34.100 --> 07:35.800
     but she wants her dog tags.

07:38.270 --> 07:39.900
No.

07:39.940 --> 07:41.770
Those belong to alejandro.

07:42.980 --> 07:45.040
   She still served her country.

07:45.080 --> 07:46.280
          She deserves her tags.

07:46.310 --> 07:48.880
Why does he want
alejandro's dog tags

07:48.910 --> 07:49.950
if alejandro is dead to him?

07:49.980 --> 07:51.920
    Because she needs them...

07:51.950 --> 07:53.180
      For her <i> quinceaera</i> .

07:56.190 --> 08:00.020
     <i> Too often, we focus on</i>
     <i> the trauma of</i>
     <i> transgender lives.</i>

08:00.060 --> 08:02.960
      <i> So, I wanted to have</i>
      <i> this</i> doble quince

08:03.000 --> 08:04.960
    <i> with my beautiful</i> damas,

08:05.000 --> 08:07.800
       <i> to celebrate</i>
       <i> our thriving lives.</i>

08:07.830 --> 08:10.830
      (cheering, applause)

08:10.870 --> 08:13.900
        what is the point
        of a, um...

08:13.940 --> 08:16.110
      A quince-- quince...

08:16.140 --> 08:17.170
                   <i> Quinceaera</i> ?

08:17.210 --> 08:19.840
              (chuckles)
              it means 15 years.

08:19.880 --> 08:22.850
    Traditionally it marks like,
    a girl's coming of age.

08:22.880 --> 08:26.780
          For jazmin,
          it's her <i> doble quince</i>
          because she's 30

08:26.820 --> 08:29.050
           and she never to have
           a quince when she was
           15, obviously.

08:29.090 --> 08:30.150
         That's lovely.

08:31.960 --> 08:35.260
   Did you have a <i> quinceaera</i> ?

08:35.289 --> 08:36.990
                          I did.

08:37.030 --> 08:38.799
              It was really fun.

08:40.830 --> 08:42.900
   <i> And so tonight, I want to</i>
   <i> bring awareness and support</i>

08:42.940 --> 08:46.940
     <i> to the 134,000 american</i>

           (cheering)

09:14.030 --> 09:16.200
                I met my father.

09:16.240 --> 09:17.930
How'd that go?

09:17.970 --> 09:19.800
    We always thought
    that he just up and left.

09:19.840 --> 09:22.770
    My mom never said
    anything good about him.

09:22.810 --> 09:24.810
              She never told us
              he went to prison.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.050
You look like your mother.

09:32.080 --> 09:33.080
        (exhales sharply)

09:33.120 --> 09:34.850
        she always said
        I look like you.

09:34.890 --> 09:37.190
      Oh, well. I wouldn't
      wish that on anyone.

09:40.090 --> 09:41.860
       How is your mother?

09:41.890 --> 09:45.200
    Uh, she passed recently.

09:45.230 --> 09:48.060
             Oh, no.

09:48.100 --> 09:49.830
              Uh...

09:50.270 --> 09:51.900
             (sighs)

09:53.140 --> 09:54.940
       man, I'm so sorry.
       I didn't know.

09:54.970 --> 09:56.240
How long was he in for?

09:56.280 --> 09:58.210
       -Ten years.
       -(exhales sharply)

09:58.240 --> 10:00.940
         can I ask what
         you went to prison for?

10:00.980 --> 10:03.210
     -Short story, drugs.
     -What's the long story?

10:03.250 --> 10:08.150
     He got pulled over for some
     bullshit traffic violation.

10:08.190 --> 10:09.190
They planted crack in my car.

10:09.220 --> 10:11.020
It was only a matter of time.

10:11.060 --> 10:12.220
They wanted me off the streets.

10:12.260 --> 10:14.290
         He was a black panther.

10:14.330 --> 10:17.230
When I was seventeen,
I joined the party.

10:17.260 --> 10:19.300
  I don't know how much
  you know about the panthers.

10:19.330 --> 10:21.130
          What? A lot.
          (chuckles)

10:21.170 --> 10:22.300
        did you ever meet
        huey newton?

10:22.330 --> 10:23.900
No, I never did.

10:23.940 --> 10:25.170
   I knew bobby seale though.

10:25.200 --> 10:27.270
         Anyway, I mean, we were
         just talking for hours

10:27.310 --> 10:30.240
          about how the fbi
          was assassinating and,

10:30.280 --> 10:32.080
     and jailing the leadership,

10:32.110 --> 10:33.840
        and how they did a bunch
        of covert stuff

10:33.880 --> 10:36.150
               to cause dissent
               inside the party.

10:36.180 --> 10:39.080
       How the same thing
       is happening today,
       with b.L.M.

10:39.120 --> 10:43.050
 Being targeted by infiltrators
 who make them out to be

10:43.090 --> 10:44.990
     some sort of terrorist
     organization.

10:45.020 --> 10:47.260
Black power scares the hell
out of people in this country.

10:47.290 --> 10:49.130
As if, if we're empowered
with equity,

10:49.160 --> 10:51.160
we're gonna take all
the money and privilege
away from them.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.030
          -(chuckling)
          -right.

10:53.070 --> 10:56.230
     Most of what we did
     in the panthers was for
     the community.

10:56.270 --> 10:59.840
You know, making free
breakfasts for the kids
in the morning,

10:59.870 --> 11:02.070
providing health services,
sickle cell testing.

11:02.110 --> 11:04.040
When it all fell apart,

11:04.080 --> 11:05.880
I went to college.

11:07.110 --> 11:08.080
Met your mother.

11:09.250 --> 11:12.180
She didn't want me
out there again, organizing.

11:12.220 --> 11:14.920
But I knew our survival
depended on protest.

11:14.950 --> 11:18.960
   Our lives begin to end
   the day we become silent
   about the things that matter.

11:21.930 --> 11:23.860
I don't regret my choice
to fight but...

11:25.230 --> 11:29.830
I do regret not being there
for you and your mother,
brother.

11:29.870 --> 11:32.270
   Isaac:
   <i> Does dom know you connected</i>
   <i> with y'all father?</i>

11:32.300 --> 11:35.170
   Dom's not ready for all this.

11:35.210 --> 11:37.070
Are you?

11:37.110 --> 11:39.010
                     Yeah, I am.

11:40.050 --> 11:41.880
I just want you to
take care of yourself.

11:44.080 --> 11:47.120
You know, with your, your
mother just passing and

11:47.150 --> 11:48.890
graduation coming,

11:48.920 --> 11:51.290
you have a right to focus
on you and your future.

11:51.320 --> 11:53.220
                    I know that.

11:53.260 --> 11:54.860
                       And I am.

11:56.830 --> 11:57.930
                    Don't worry.

12:00.930 --> 12:04.270
 So, anyway, besides organizing
 and promoting tonight's event,

12:04.300 --> 12:06.170
        guests can use
        the act-ivism app

12:06.200 --> 12:09.840
    to place bids on auction
    items and make donations.

12:09.880 --> 12:12.810
      Which will be projected
      on those monitors
      whenever we open the bids.

12:12.840 --> 12:14.940
   We'll be able to see how much
   we're making donations-wise

12:14.980 --> 12:18.050
     in real time, and hopefully
     it'll inspire people
     to donate more.

12:20.920 --> 12:24.120
     Oh, but you know what?
     Um, enough shop talk.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.890
 Have you met my sister callie?

12:27.990 --> 12:30.890
         Callie! Callie!

12:35.970 --> 12:37.970
           Callie, this is evan.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.200
      Um, if you will excuse me,

12:40.240 --> 12:42.110
    I have-- I'll be right back.
    I got to go.

12:46.110 --> 12:49.080
I've heard so much about you.

12:49.110 --> 12:50.850
       You have? From who?

12:52.220 --> 12:54.120
        From mariana.

12:54.150 --> 12:55.080
               Ah.

12:58.060 --> 12:59.960
             So, did you have a,
             a <i> quinceaera</i> ?

13:01.290 --> 13:02.230
               No.

13:05.030 --> 13:07.030
Excuse me.

13:07.070 --> 13:08.900
Hey. I need you, now.

13:08.930 --> 13:09.830
          What's wrong?

13:09.870 --> 13:10.970
      The app is crashing!

13:15.820 --> 13:17.690
       Oh, my god,
       we loved your set!Re her.

13:17.730 --> 13:19.390
           Oh, thanks.

13:19.430 --> 13:20.760
        I mean, it wasn't
        a full set.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.560
       Well, where do you
       do stand-up?

13:22.600 --> 13:24.460
      In the shower mostly.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.530
       Okay, well, we host
       a comedy show.

13:26.570 --> 13:29.440
     It's women, it's queer,
     it's amazing.

13:29.470 --> 13:31.600
    You should come through.
    Maybe get on stage.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.540
It's a chill space
to try out new material.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.640
      Totally, that sounds
      really fun, actually.

13:35.680 --> 13:37.680
      -Thanks!
      -Let me put my number
      in your phone.

13:37.710 --> 13:39.380
 Oh, yeah. Uh, uh, do you mind?

13:41.580 --> 13:42.720
Okay...

13:42.750 --> 13:45.390
    And you should hit me up
    on instagram too.

13:45.420 --> 13:47.590
      I'm amazing
      at creating content.

13:47.620 --> 13:49.420
               Oh, nice. Sydney.

13:49.460 --> 13:50.790
Like in australia.

13:50.830 --> 13:51.830
     Is your name melbourne?

13:51.860 --> 13:53.730
       Koalas. Oh, sorry.

13:53.760 --> 13:55.600
This is, uh,
my girlfriend joey.

13:55.630 --> 13:57.530
       -Partner.
       -Oh, right. Sorry.

13:57.570 --> 13:58.670
                       Hi.

13:58.700 --> 14:00.300
                            Hey.

14:03.710 --> 14:04.740
           You're fun.

14:04.770 --> 14:07.340
       Uh, okay, maybe we
       see you on Tuesday.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.470
      See you next Tuesday.

14:08.510 --> 14:09.780
         -Ohhh!
         -That means...

14:09.810 --> 14:11.340
              (imitates rimshot)

14:11.380 --> 14:12.650
I shouldn't say that.

14:13.820 --> 14:14.680
              What?

14:18.790 --> 14:20.490
You having fun?

14:20.520 --> 14:22.520
             (sighs)

14:22.560 --> 14:23.790
             it's the best night
             of my life.

14:23.830 --> 14:28.660
Well, I'll try to keep
those bests going later
on tonight.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.570
       I'm so proud of you
       for doing this.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.780
          And I'm sorry I didn't
          get your dog tags.

14:44.380 --> 14:45.380
It's okay.

14:47.420 --> 14:48.650
         But I did get you this.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.720
Gael?

14:54.760 --> 14:58.390
         I'm not sure if it goes
         with your dress, but...

15:06.430 --> 15:07.400
           I love it.

15:12.810 --> 15:14.440
           Thank you.

15:14.480 --> 15:17.510
         I haven't had a chance
         to thank you for making
         her dress.

15:17.550 --> 15:18.540
                  It's stunning.

15:19.650 --> 15:22.680
It was a labor of love.
I'm glad she asked.

15:25.350 --> 15:28.320
You could have... Asked.

15:31.590 --> 15:32.690
But I know why you didn't.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.660
Same reason why
you won't let me buy
one of your pieces.

15:36.700 --> 15:39.370
Don't want to
owe me anything.

15:39.400 --> 15:41.430
         I just want things
         to be clean between us.

15:42.740 --> 15:43.740
               After everything.

15:46.840 --> 15:48.440
I'm not that guy anymore.

15:56.420 --> 15:58.450
So, are you going to tell gael
that you're back with jamie?

15:58.490 --> 16:00.550
               No.

16:00.590 --> 16:03.560
  What am I supposed to do,
  just walk up to him and say,

16:03.590 --> 16:06.490
   "hey, I'm seeing jamie again,
   just f.Y.I."

16:06.530 --> 16:09.760
    not like he's waiting for me
    to make some decision.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.700
Are you sure about that?

16:11.730 --> 16:13.500
                 Yes. I am sure.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.700
  Besides, I think he's seeing
  his ex again.

16:16.740 --> 16:17.740
             Bryan?

16:17.770 --> 16:20.570
           No. Elijah.

16:23.350 --> 16:24.510
If my app crashes
in front of evan,

16:24.550 --> 16:25.750
he'll totally lose
faith in me.

16:25.780 --> 16:27.750
Plus, his board of directors
already aren't supportive,

16:27.780 --> 16:29.650
and the bro-holes
at speckulate will be like,

16:29.680 --> 16:32.520
"oh, I told you that
women engineers aren't
as smart as men."

16:32.550 --> 16:34.750
not to mention,
letting gael and jazmin down,

16:34.790 --> 16:35.790
and the entire
trans community.

16:35.820 --> 16:38.660
         Just don't panic, okay?
         We can fix it.

16:38.690 --> 16:40.490
   Uh, did you verify the server
   response is correct?

16:40.530 --> 16:42.730
Y-you were in charge of all
of the recent server changes.

16:42.760 --> 16:44.730
           That you requested,
           I just typed them up.

16:44.770 --> 16:47.470
       No offense, but no one
       has much ownership
       on anything here but you.

16:47.500 --> 16:48.740
        Wh-what is that
        supposed to mean?

16:48.770 --> 16:52.610
   That... You don't delegate.
   You control everything.

16:56.510 --> 17:00.310
Wow! Okay, fine.
You fix it then.

17:00.350 --> 17:01.750
     -What are you doing?
     -This is me delegating.

17:04.390 --> 17:06.520
    Okay, fine. I'll fix it.

17:13.930 --> 17:15.230
              -Hey!
              -Hey!

17:15.260 --> 17:16.900
        I'm so glad you're here.

17:16.930 --> 17:19.099
     I just want to say,
     you look so beautiful.

17:19.130 --> 17:21.230
                  Oh, thank you.

17:21.270 --> 17:23.099
             Is, uh, jamie here?

17:24.339 --> 17:28.040
He wishes he could be here,
but, uh, he has a work thing.

17:28.079 --> 17:29.140
                    Aw, too bad.

17:29.180 --> 17:32.180
   I was just curious,
   because, well, I invited him,

17:32.210 --> 17:33.880
         but I never heard back.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.950
        You invited him?

17:38.320 --> 17:40.250
       So, how do you feel
       about drake?

17:40.290 --> 17:42.020
             Drake?

17:42.060 --> 17:43.120
      Not a "hotline bling"
      kind of gal?

17:48.160 --> 17:50.160
    Oh, yeah.
    That's exactly it. Yeah.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.360
           Yeah. (clears throat)

17:51.400 --> 17:53.300
  well, I can get tickets
  to his concert Saturday night.

17:56.040 --> 17:56.940
                 Saturday night?

17:58.940 --> 18:02.240
   Um, I promised mariana
   I'd go to this work thing.

18:02.280 --> 18:04.910
          Something to do with
          the launch of her app.

18:04.950 --> 18:05.950
        Yeah, no worries.

18:12.150 --> 18:13.250
You sure it looks
good there?

18:13.290 --> 18:15.090
       Yeah, looks great.

18:15.120 --> 18:17.020
           Let's eat.

18:17.060 --> 18:18.320
                           Yeah.

18:18.360 --> 18:21.260
 I mean, he was so sweet
 in helping with my settlement.

18:21.300 --> 18:23.000
     Well, give him my love.

18:23.030 --> 18:24.030
             I will.

18:27.170 --> 18:28.270
      (faint music playing)

18:30.370 --> 18:32.000
   there. I think I fixed it.

18:32.040 --> 18:33.070
Wait, you think?

18:33.110 --> 18:34.970
                   I did fix it.

18:35.010 --> 18:36.880
Well, how do we know?

18:36.910 --> 18:38.110
                         I know.

18:39.180 --> 18:40.150
                        I think.

18:43.220 --> 18:44.920
      (dance music playing)

18:44.950 --> 18:45.990
how's it going?

18:46.020 --> 18:47.220
           Psh. Good.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.320
 Thanks for helping out tonight.

18:48.360 --> 18:49.360
Oh, happy to.

18:49.390 --> 18:52.260
         Plus, I can use
         the tips.

18:52.290 --> 18:54.160
Yeah, how, how are you
doing with money?

18:54.200 --> 18:57.000
Mm, I could always use more.

18:58.930 --> 19:01.000
           I could put a word in
           at my job.

19:01.040 --> 19:04.270
    We could be a brother-sister
    bartending duo at duoro.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.310
        -Okay. (chuckles)
        -I'm serious!

19:06.340 --> 19:08.110
   It'd be fun to work together.

19:08.140 --> 19:10.080
Hey! Okay.
If it's not a problem.

19:10.110 --> 19:11.910
Yeah, it's no problem.

19:11.950 --> 19:12.910
        I got your back.

19:14.920 --> 19:15.950
I appreciate that.

19:18.920 --> 19:21.250
      Damn. Okay, mr. Hall.

19:21.290 --> 19:23.920
             Hey your damn self,
             ms. Williams.

19:27.230 --> 19:28.230
                 Sorry I'm late.

19:28.260 --> 19:30.060
   It's okay.
   You got a business to run.

19:30.100 --> 19:31.160
      How you doing, man? Isaac.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.330
   -Dom.
   -Nice to meet you, my man.

19:32.370 --> 19:34.130
             Tiana:
             Malika.

19:34.170 --> 19:35.970
            -Oh, hey.
            -Hey.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.940
   Hey! Thanks for hooking us up
   with your girl mariana.

19:37.970 --> 19:40.240
    We're excited for b.L.M.
    To consult her new app.

19:43.210 --> 19:46.080
  So, when we talk about police
  killing our people--

19:46.110 --> 19:50.320
   you know, those 460 people
   killed by police

19:50.350 --> 19:52.320
   and still awaiting justice?

19:52.350 --> 19:55.320
     In black lives matter,
     we understand it's
     a whole system

19:55.360 --> 19:58.260
       -that includes
       district attorneys.
       -Patrisse: Yep.

19:58.290 --> 20:01.890
   And we have to think about
   how to address

20:01.930 --> 20:03.930
  these d.A.'s in this country,

20:03.970 --> 20:06.130
  that are in sweetheart deals
  with the police.

20:06.170 --> 20:09.000
     Where they won't even
     open up investigations,

20:09.040 --> 20:10.240
      let alone prosecute,

20:10.270 --> 20:13.040
   until they get the
   investigation of the police

20:13.070 --> 20:14.170
       who actually
       murdered our folks.

20:14.210 --> 20:16.180
           This is why

20:16.210 --> 20:19.110
        police are almost
        never prosecuted

20:19.150 --> 20:21.380
    -for killing our people.
    -(audience murmuring)

20:21.420 --> 20:24.120
   malika:
   <i> Well, I really want to be a</i>
   <i> part of the transformation,</i>

20:24.150 --> 20:26.920
          not just the response.
          I want to do more.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.060
   That's dope! We'd love
   to have you get in deeper.

20:29.090 --> 20:31.260
Yeah, and the work
you did for jamal?

20:31.290 --> 20:32.290
       That was powerful.

20:32.330 --> 20:33.960
Thank you.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.230
              What does more
              look like for you?

20:35.260 --> 20:38.970
I don't know.
I just, I just know this work
speaks to my soul.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.130
 Yeah, that's cause the turn up
 is like taking our power back.

20:42.170 --> 20:43.970
     It's, it's therapeutic,

20:44.010 --> 20:47.110
       it's invigorating,
       it's meaningful,

20:47.140 --> 20:50.210
-and that's not all
there is to it.
                    -At all.

20:50.250 --> 20:53.180
There's the late nights
on the phone with families

20:53.210 --> 20:56.080
     -who are crying because
     they miss their babies.
     -Mm-hmm.

20:56.120 --> 20:58.950
                Cause jamal's
                not just a cause
                to his mother.

20:58.990 --> 21:01.120
         He's her child.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.290
You know, folks love
the visible work:

21:03.320 --> 21:05.190
Being in front of
the news cameras,

21:05.230 --> 21:07.160
  but it's the invisible work,

21:07.200 --> 21:09.130
that's the work
that actually matters.

21:09.160 --> 21:11.300
       And if you're ready
       to help with that,

21:11.330 --> 21:13.930
         we are so ready
         to have you.

21:13.970 --> 21:16.200
        Ready. You ready?

21:16.240 --> 21:17.940
           I'm ready.

21:17.970 --> 21:19.140
All right!

21:19.170 --> 21:20.970
                 Welcome malika!

21:21.010 --> 21:22.380
     -Thank you, thank you.
     -(all giggling)

21:22.410 --> 21:25.280
     -isaac, this is tiana.
     -Hi.

21:25.310 --> 21:27.050
           -Hi.
           -This is--

21:27.080 --> 21:28.250
          -isaac?
          -Isaac, yeah.

21:28.280 --> 21:30.950
 -Nice to meet you.
 -Nice, nice to meet you. Yeah.

21:30.990 --> 21:34.120
 Um, we're going to the city
 council meeting Wednesday night

21:34.160 --> 21:35.350
              to protest the new
              prison build.

21:35.390 --> 21:37.220
We'll see you there?

21:39.060 --> 21:41.190
         -Yes, you will.
         -All right.

22:00.450 --> 22:03.550
So, jazmin invited jamie
to her <i> quinceaera.</i>

22:03.580 --> 22:06.290
     So? I thought you said
     hecouldn't come.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.420
      -I didn't invite him.
      -Why?

22:08.460 --> 22:12.360
I just didn't want it to be
awkward for gael, like,
it's his sister's party.

22:12.390 --> 22:13.630
       Why would it
       be awkward for gael

22:13.660 --> 22:16.260
       if he's not waiting
       around for you?

22:16.300 --> 22:18.560
I was just trying to be
sensitive to his feelings.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.500
          Okay. Well, what about
          jamie's feelings?

22:20.540 --> 22:22.230
    I mean, seriously callie,
    you really think

22:22.270 --> 22:23.440
   he's not going to find out
   about tonight?

22:23.470 --> 22:25.540
        Hello, instagram.

22:25.570 --> 22:27.240
  Jamie doesn't have instagram.

22:27.280 --> 22:28.570
                   The point is:

22:28.610 --> 22:30.580
          The reason you haven't
          told gael about jamie

22:30.610 --> 22:32.240
            is because you don't
            want him to move on,

22:32.280 --> 22:33.650
          'cause you always have
          one foot out the door.

22:33.680 --> 22:36.250
      I mean, when are you gonna
      make a serious choice
      with these guys

22:36.280 --> 22:38.250
              and not have them
              hanging on a hook?

22:38.290 --> 22:39.690
   -Or line?
   -Jazmin: <i> Excuse me?</i>
   <i> Can I have your attention?</i>

22:39.720 --> 22:41.690
   Dangling? I dunno.
   Whatever the expression is.

22:41.720 --> 22:44.490
    You know what
    I'm trying to say. Sorry.

22:44.530 --> 22:48.360
  <i> I'm hoping everyone has</i>
  <i> downloaded the act-ivism app</i>

22:48.400 --> 22:50.700
  <i> and has had a chance to shop</i>
  <i> some of the auction items.</i>

22:50.730 --> 22:54.330
    <i> Bids and donations</i>
    <i> are now officially open!</i>

22:54.370 --> 22:56.170
      (cheering, applause)

23:00.540 --> 23:02.270
        everything okay?

23:02.310 --> 23:05.610
            Yeah, just doing
            some last-minute
            penetration testing.

23:05.650 --> 23:07.250
                   On the app!

23:46.420 --> 23:48.620
     Got pretty funky out there.

23:48.660 --> 23:51.520
        -(chuckling)
        -thanks, daddio.

23:53.530 --> 23:55.260
     You look beautiful tonight.

23:55.300 --> 23:58.500
      Thank you. So do you.

23:58.530 --> 23:59.500
             Thanks.

24:02.600 --> 24:04.270
           Can I ask,

24:05.440 --> 24:07.310
     are you seeing elijah?

24:11.350 --> 24:14.350
   No. I'm not seeing anyone.

24:22.620 --> 24:24.260
Who's that?

24:25.690 --> 24:27.430
          <i> Quinceaera</i> ?

24:27.460 --> 24:29.430
     <i> Doble quince</i> , actually.

24:29.460 --> 24:32.630
(scoffs) that's ridiculous.

24:32.670 --> 24:35.600
  Dad, no, it's not, and she's
  doing it as a fundraiser

24:35.640 --> 24:38.200
  to help fight the transgender
  military ban.

24:38.240 --> 24:40.340
    Those people shouldn't be
    in the military.

24:40.370 --> 24:42.270
  -Why not?
  -Because they disrupt order.

24:42.310 --> 24:43.580
               That is not true.

24:43.610 --> 24:45.440
    If he wants his dog tags,

24:45.480 --> 24:46.610
       (speaking spanish)

24:46.650 --> 24:48.380
        they don't belong
        to him anymore!

24:54.220 --> 24:56.420
          She served her country
          the same as you did,

24:56.460 --> 24:57.560
                 and <i> abuelo</i> did.

24:58.660 --> 25:01.230
     And she did it for you,
     to make you proud,

25:01.260 --> 25:02.530
                 and you were so
                 proud of her.

25:02.560 --> 25:07.200
    I was proud of alejandro.
    My son.

25:07.240 --> 25:08.500
         I miss my son,

25:10.270 --> 25:11.500
                but she took him
                away from us.

25:11.540 --> 25:13.170
         She killed him.

25:13.210 --> 25:17.410
    She didn't kill anyone, dad!
    Your child is still alive.

25:17.450 --> 25:19.480
We only have one child now.

25:21.250 --> 25:23.620
      One son who hasn't
      brought shame on us.

25:27.690 --> 25:29.520
                  You know what?

25:29.560 --> 25:33.230
     If jazmin is no longer your
     child because she's trans,

25:34.500 --> 25:36.300
           then I guess you have
           no children at all,

25:37.430 --> 25:38.600
           because I'm bisexual.

25:45.240 --> 25:47.210
         That is my grandfather.

26:05.390 --> 26:07.360
            -Jazmin?
            -<i> Abuelo.</i>

26:07.400 --> 26:08.490
    What are you doing here?

26:09.630 --> 26:11.330
       (speaking spanish)

26:28.550 --> 26:30.420
       (speaking spanish)

26:41.500 --> 26:43.330
       (speaking spanish)

26:54.440 --> 26:59.580
    <i>  I know what's it like,</i>
    <i> I know how it feels </i>

27:01.480 --> 27:03.520
      <i>  let the pain break</i>
      <i> you down now </i>

27:03.550 --> 27:06.550
       <i>  you gotta give it</i>
       <i> time to heal </i>

27:09.290 --> 27:14.290
      <i>  don't worry now,</i>
      <i> even though the fear</i>
      <i> is real </i>

27:16.330 --> 27:21.470
        <i>  just hold on </i>

27:24.210 --> 27:28.210
     <i>  if you're ready,</i>
     <i> start again,</i>
     <i> I'll be here waiting </i>

27:28.240 --> 27:30.380
    <i>  reaching out my hand </i>

27:30.410 --> 27:32.510
     <i>  love is the answer </i>

27:34.380 --> 27:37.220
     <i>  love is the answer </i>

27:38.550 --> 27:43.220
        <i>  just hold on </i>

27:46.230 --> 27:50.360
        <i> - just hold on </i>
        -(applause)

28:00.090 --> 28:01.620
   (faint dance music playing)

28:08.130 --> 28:09.130
                       you okay?

28:12.000 --> 28:12.940
              Yeah.

28:14.210 --> 28:16.770
Blown away,
but definitely okay.

28:18.040 --> 28:19.980
It's amazing
my <i> abuelo</i> came.

28:21.850 --> 28:23.210
He's so old school,
you know?

28:25.850 --> 28:28.250
If he can accept jazmin,

28:31.160 --> 28:33.760
it gives me hope that
my parents will come
around some day.

28:36.030 --> 28:37.030
               That's wonderful.

28:43.030 --> 28:45.130
    -Callie, I--
    -I'm seeing jamie again.

28:53.280 --> 28:57.850
   -I didn't know if I needed
   to tell you that but--
   -you didn't.

29:08.990 --> 29:10.960
I want you
to be happy, callie.

29:16.130 --> 29:17.130
                      Thank you.

29:20.970 --> 29:21.970
                        You too.

29:34.290 --> 29:36.120
         I'm sorry that
         I yelled at you

29:36.150 --> 29:38.850
       and I'm sorry that
       I'm a micromanager.

29:39.990 --> 29:43.130
       You can't help it,
       and you're not.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.830
           Yes, I am.

29:45.860 --> 29:48.000
I was just being defensive.

29:48.030 --> 29:49.260
     Yeah, because I blamed you.

29:49.300 --> 29:51.070
    Because it was my fault.

29:51.100 --> 29:54.070
No. It was my fault,

29:56.210 --> 29:58.140
and I wish I could
kiss you right now.

29:58.180 --> 29:59.810
                         Me too.

30:07.320 --> 30:10.890
    Jazmin:
    <i> Excuse me. Excuse me.</i>
    <i> Sorry to stop the music.</i>

30:10.920 --> 30:13.090
    <i> I just wanted to announce</i>
    <i> that we raised</i>

30:13.120 --> 30:15.890
      <i> close to 20 thousand</i>
      <i> dollars tonight!</i>

30:15.930 --> 30:18.830
      (cheering, applause)

30:18.860 --> 30:20.930
       <i> thank you all</i>
       <i> for your generosity</i>

30:20.970 --> 30:24.030
     <i> and a huge thank you</i>
     <i> to mariana</i>
     <i> for her act-ivism app.</i>

30:24.070 --> 30:25.900
   <i> Let's hear it for mariana.</i>

30:25.940 --> 30:27.170
           (cheering)

30:30.880 --> 30:34.140
  mariana, I'm kirk, with center
  for transgender veterans.

30:34.180 --> 30:36.280
             Seriously, your app
             is amazing.

30:36.310 --> 30:41.080
     With a crowd this size,
     we expected maybe to
     raise half this much.

30:41.120 --> 30:43.190
                  So, thank you.

30:43.220 --> 30:45.250
        Well, I may have brought
        the cows to water,

30:45.290 --> 30:47.190
                but they coughed
                up the cash.

30:47.220 --> 30:48.290
          (chuckles)
          well, congratulations.

30:48.330 --> 30:49.890
       Thank you so much.

30:50.900 --> 30:52.330
     I think the expression
     is horse to water.

30:52.360 --> 30:55.230
  This is amazing!
  We doubled their expectations!

31:05.140 --> 31:08.240
             You made jazmin
             very happy tonight,

31:08.280 --> 31:09.980
                     and me too.

31:10.010 --> 31:12.850
I love all my grandchildren.

31:12.880 --> 31:15.120
Don't turn your back
on family, and, uh,

31:15.150 --> 31:17.990
you don't have to understand
everything to accept it.

31:18.020 --> 31:20.020
       (speaking spanish)

31:20.060 --> 31:22.820
I have,
and I will continue to.

31:22.860 --> 31:26.260
And hopefully one day,
they'll see that jazmin
had no choice, but you do.

31:27.970 --> 31:30.100
You can choose to be
with a woman.

31:30.130 --> 31:34.870
   You can choose not to
   break your parents' hearts.

31:37.010 --> 31:38.070
       (speaking spanish)

31:43.980 --> 31:47.320
      <i>  life laid you low </i>

31:52.020 --> 31:56.260
     <i>  walked with a ghost </i>

31:59.030 --> 32:01.000
    <i>  don't close your eyes </i>

32:01.030 --> 32:03.030
you came out to our parents?

32:05.040 --> 32:06.770
              Yeah.

32:08.140 --> 32:11.070
    <i>  see through the smoke </i>

32:11.110 --> 32:13.280
   so what are you doing
   for all the major holidays?

32:14.880 --> 32:16.850
       <i>  from the ashes </i>

32:16.880 --> 32:20.820
        <i>  we get all our</i>
        <i> second chances </i>

32:20.850 --> 32:22.150
hey. Why are you
hanging out in here?

32:23.890 --> 32:24.920
   The party's over, isn't it?

32:27.860 --> 32:30.090
   Look, I'm sorry I didn't
   tell you that I joined blm

32:30.130 --> 32:31.990
     but I know how you feel
     about my activism.

32:34.060 --> 32:37.100
    I don't... I don't judge
    you activism.

32:37.130 --> 32:40.170
     I mean, if anything, you...

32:40.200 --> 32:41.270
                 You judge mine.

32:41.310 --> 32:43.840
          Like, I know you think
          I don't get it.

32:43.870 --> 32:46.880
  Or I'm not woke because
  the way I resist is different
  from yours.

32:46.910 --> 32:48.840
   But I give back to my people.

32:48.880 --> 32:50.210
 And I'm a successful black man.

32:50.250 --> 32:52.310
     And to me, that's part
     of the revolution.

32:56.090 --> 32:57.020
          You're right.

32:59.120 --> 33:00.060
           I'm sorry.

33:01.860 --> 33:04.090
       And I don't mean to
       judge you, ever.

33:05.900 --> 33:09.060
          Look, I want you to be
          who you want to be.

33:09.100 --> 33:12.000
            I just get concerned
            for your safety.

33:12.040 --> 33:13.140
                      Because...

33:14.870 --> 33:15.800
                You're my woman.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.810
     -I'm your woman?
     -Yeah, you're my woman.

33:21.850 --> 33:23.850
          -You my man?
          -Yeah.

33:23.880 --> 33:25.850
         <i>  oh, my lady </i>

33:25.880 --> 33:27.120
       oh. (clears throat)

33:27.150 --> 33:29.080
           uh, sorry.

33:29.120 --> 33:30.890
I don't mean to stop
the love.

33:30.920 --> 33:32.120
I just-- I gotta grab
a jacket.

33:32.160 --> 33:34.920
      -How'd it go tonight?
      -Uh, not bad.

33:34.960 --> 33:36.890
     -Um, I'll walk you out.
     -Okay.

33:38.200 --> 33:40.160
       Don't leave, okay?

33:40.200 --> 33:41.900
             -Okay.
             -Okay?

33:44.230 --> 33:47.070
So I will talk to
my manager at duoro
tomorrow about the job.

33:47.100 --> 33:50.110
   -Oh, dope. I appreciate it.
   -Yeah, of course.

33:50.140 --> 33:51.170
I'm glad you came.

33:51.210 --> 33:52.970
          -Me too.
          -Hey, malika.

33:54.810 --> 33:56.850
     Sorry to bust in like this.

33:56.880 --> 33:57.950
                I tried calling.

33:59.080 --> 33:59.980
Um...

34:01.050 --> 34:02.850
Is everything okay?

34:02.890 --> 34:04.150
          No... I'm...

34:05.960 --> 34:07.090
       I'm being evicted.

34:08.929 --> 34:09.929
           Uh, who is this?

34:11.260 --> 34:14.960
          Um... (sighs)
          um, this...

34:17.170 --> 34:18.199
        This is our dad.

34:22.170 --> 34:23.040
              Dom?

34:24.980 --> 34:26.040
            Hey, man.

34:28.179 --> 34:29.980
So, this is how
you got my back?

34:34.179 --> 34:36.920
       -Hey, wait, son...
       -Hey, man!

34:36.949 --> 34:38.920
I am not your son.

34:39.290 --> 34:40.260
                           What?

35:04.050 --> 35:05.250
                       Hi.

35:05.280 --> 35:06.850
               Hi.

35:08.150 --> 35:10.190
        How was jazmin's
        <i> doble quince</i> ?

35:12.020 --> 35:13.990
          It was nice.

35:14.020 --> 35:15.060
         Can I come in?

35:27.270 --> 35:31.240
I tokay, you're obviously upset.
Stawhat's going on?Night.

35:32.410 --> 35:35.280
Well, you obviously have
a problem with my pronouns.

35:35.310 --> 35:36.380
          No, I don't.

35:36.410 --> 35:38.380
You joked about it
in your routine tonight.

35:38.420 --> 35:40.380
    I was joking about me, okay?

35:40.420 --> 35:43.190
     And how I don't really know
     who I am when it comes
     to this stuff.

35:43.220 --> 35:46.220
     Exactly, you don't know
     who you are.

35:46.260 --> 35:48.190
And you have no boundaries.

35:48.230 --> 35:51.160
You made up your bed
with these ridiculous sheets

35:51.200 --> 35:53.230
just 'cause you didn't
want to tell your mom
they suck.

35:53.260 --> 35:55.160
             Look who's talking.
             Are you kidding me?

35:55.200 --> 35:56.930
              You don't know who
              you are either.

35:56.970 --> 35:59.030
Wow.

35:59.070 --> 36:01.940
Actually, I do know who I am.

36:01.970 --> 36:03.910
I'm not confused, you are.

36:03.940 --> 36:05.370
        Okay, fine. Yes.

36:05.410 --> 36:07.110
  I'm a little confused, okay?

36:07.140 --> 36:09.040
         I don't totally get it,
         but I'm trying to.

36:09.080 --> 36:10.150
You don't have to get it.

36:10.180 --> 36:12.050
     I don't expect someone
     who's comfortable

36:12.080 --> 36:13.980
       in their gender
       identity to get it,

36:14.020 --> 36:15.120
   but you do have to get me.

36:15.150 --> 36:17.120
      I'm trying to, okay?

36:17.150 --> 36:19.120
    But that goes both ways.

36:19.160 --> 36:21.220
          I'm sorry that I just
          came out of the closet

36:21.260 --> 36:23.060
     like two minutes ago, okay?

36:23.090 --> 36:26.060
    I'm trying to figure out
    who I am as a lesbian
    and a comedian.

36:26.100 --> 36:27.300
  Do you know how hard that is?

36:27.330 --> 36:31.030
    I'm not a perfectly
    fully formed human being

36:31.070 --> 36:33.970
 but I can't keep trying
 to convince you to be with me.

36:35.340 --> 36:36.940
   How's that for boundaries?

36:37.640 --> 36:38.210
(exhales sharply)

36:39.340 --> 36:40.280
not bad.

36:41.980 --> 36:42.940
For a beginner.

36:44.410 --> 36:47.180
I'm sorry.

36:47.220 --> 36:48.950
        I'm just scared.

36:57.090 --> 36:58.030
       What are you doing?

36:58.060 --> 37:00.130
             There was a mistake
             in the code.

37:00.160 --> 37:01.900
What mistake?
It worked great.

37:01.930 --> 37:04.330
          No. The app literally
          doubled the donations.

37:04.370 --> 37:06.370
          That's why we exceeded
          their expectations.

37:06.400 --> 37:09.140
           We only made $10,000,
           not 20.

37:09.170 --> 37:10.870
            Oh, shit.

37:13.180 --> 37:15.010
           Excuse me.

37:15.050 --> 37:17.010
      I just wanted to say
      goodnight.

37:17.050 --> 37:19.950
   And congratulations
   on a successful beta test.

37:23.390 --> 37:24.390
           Thank you.

37:37.100 --> 37:40.900
         Alice, I've been really
         burned in the past.

37:43.110 --> 37:48.140
            And I guess I'm just
            afraid that...

37:49.310 --> 37:52.010
               If you don't know
               who you are,

37:52.050 --> 37:55.250
            as a lesbian,
            if you're exploring,

37:58.060 --> 37:59.220
        it's gonna happen again.

38:03.230 --> 38:09.160
Have you completely forgotten
I've been burned too?

38:09.200 --> 38:11.900
By sumi. With meera.

38:11.940 --> 38:14.370
I would never do that to you,
what she did to me.

38:14.400 --> 38:18.040
I would never want to put you
through that much pain.

38:18.080 --> 38:20.080
Look, I don't have to go
to the queer comedy night.

38:20.110 --> 38:21.380
                    Yes, you do.

38:21.410 --> 38:23.350
            You have to go
            check out the scene.

38:23.380 --> 38:27.280
     And you need to get support
     from other queer comics.

38:27.320 --> 38:30.850
 To deal with.

38:30.890 --> 38:32.290
So you're not
breaking up with me?

38:32.320 --> 38:34.290
             -Again.
             -No.

38:38.060 --> 38:38.990
                        I can't.

38:40.930 --> 38:42.130
              'cause I'm falling
              in love with you.

38:43.330 --> 38:44.200
(laughs softly)

38:47.170 --> 38:49.940
I'm falling in love
with you, too.

39:00.020 --> 39:02.850
          So, when did you learn
          how to dance?

39:04.860 --> 39:06.860
I could always dance.

39:06.890 --> 39:08.890
        Yeah, maybe the bachata.

39:10.930 --> 39:13.030
You're just jealous 'cause
I got more rhythm than you.

39:13.060 --> 39:15.030
            Oh, yeah?

39:15.070 --> 39:16.300
              Yeah.

39:16.330 --> 39:18.900
           We'll see about that.

39:38.320 --> 39:40.120
       I don't expect you
       to invite me

39:40.160 --> 39:42.260
         to every party
         at the coterie.

39:42.290 --> 39:44.090
                    I know.

39:44.130 --> 39:45.960
                I'm sorry.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.260
Just be honest with me.

39:49.130 --> 39:50.170
                  Okay.

39:53.100 --> 39:55.340
                To be honest,

39:55.370 --> 39:58.040
               gael isn't seeing
               bryan anymore.

39:58.080 --> 40:02.180
  And he told me that
  if you weren't the guy for me,

40:02.210 --> 40:03.880
           that he wanted to be.

40:05.280 --> 40:07.180
      Is that why
      you needed space

40:07.220 --> 40:08.980
         after you quit
         your clerkship?

40:09.020 --> 40:10.290
             Partly.

40:14.120 --> 40:17.230
       I didn't know that jazmin
       invited you tonight.

40:17.260 --> 40:20.300
                  And the reason
                  I didn't is...

40:20.330 --> 40:23.100
      Because I didn't want
      to flaunt my choice

40:23.130 --> 40:25.100
     in front of gael
     at his sister's party.

40:29.970 --> 40:31.270
       So I'm your choice?

40:33.340 --> 40:34.880
              Yes.

40:37.380 --> 40:39.280
       In that case, um...

40:40.320 --> 40:43.950
    <i>  put your hands on me </i>

40:43.990 --> 40:46.020
        all is forgiven.
