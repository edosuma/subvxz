00:21.483 --> 00:23.017
I have to get out of here!

Aah! [Grunts]

[Breathing heavily]

00:40.035 --> 00:42.301
- Oh, come on.
- [Touch screen clicking]

00:43.204 --> 00:45.138
Answer!

00:47.509 --> 00:48.959

01:09.765 --> 01:11.432
What do you mean she's not here?

01:11.433 --> 01:12.933
As in, she's somewhere else.

01:12.934 --> 01:15.186
You mean, she just up and left
to go visit a friend?

01:15.187 --> 01:18.406
Yes, something you should all
take advantage of more often.

01:18.407 --> 01:21.242
Jenkins, it's working. It's happenin'!

01:21.243 --> 01:23.160
- What's working? What's happening?
- Chupacabra.

01:23.161 --> 01:24.779
You mean that thing we brought
back from Elk Grove Village?

01:24.780 --> 01:26.747
Yeah, Jenkins was kind
enough to run a pipe

01:26.748 --> 01:29.200
from the room of perpetual fire...
He begged me to do it.

01:29.201 --> 01:30.751
...straight into a smoker behind his lab.

01:30.752 --> 01:32.670
Get ready for chupacabra jerky.

01:32.671 --> 01:34.036
Ew, you're cooking it?

01:34.037 --> 01:37.683
No, <i>he's</i> making it!
The chupacabra! He's awesome!

01:37.684 --> 01:38.458
Is that safe?

01:38.459 --> 01:40.487
As long as we keep it away
from the goats on level four.

01:40.488 --> 01:42.187
- We have goats?
- We've got goats?

01:42.188 --> 01:45.858
- [Wind gusts]
- Ah.

01:45.859 --> 01:46.883
Hawthorne, New Hampshire.

01:46.884 --> 01:49.385
A young campaign staffer goes missing.

01:49.386 --> 01:51.107
Who wants to go fetch Colonel Baird back

01:51.108 --> 01:52.256
from her "friend"?

01:52.257 --> 01:54.450
I remember you took a jaunt
to Oklahoma without her.

01:54.451 --> 01:57.669
Certainly you can handle
a small New England town.

01:57.670 --> 02:00.455
MAN: I'm sorry for interrupting
my opponent's press conference,

02:00.456 --> 02:02.457
but we need to talk about the issues,

02:02.458 --> 02:05.460
like finishing up this nasty
gas line construction

02:05.461 --> 02:08.847
and getting our city's parking
situation back to normal.

02:08.848 --> 02:11.015
WOMAN: Of course, but we
have to ask, Mr. Denning,

02:11.017 --> 02:12.717
about the disappearance

02:12.718 --> 02:14.936
of your very young campaign
staffer Brandy Vargas.

02:14.937 --> 02:17.522
Well, as I said to the other
reporters before, um,

02:17.523 --> 02:19.357
it's an unfortunate situation.

02:19.358 --> 02:20.976
And until we have more information

02:20.977 --> 02:23.645
and real answers, I
really can't comment.

02:23.646 --> 02:25.947
I agree with my opponent.

02:25.948 --> 02:27.365
The disappearance of a young woman

02:27.366 --> 02:28.867
who worked directly with Mr. Denning,

02:28.868 --> 02:32.654
in no way impacts this campaign,
nor should the voters

02:32.655 --> 02:36.408
consider anything heinous
in regards to my opponent,

02:36.409 --> 02:37.959
despite the police investigation.

02:37.960 --> 02:39.461
It's a cheap shot, Keating.

02:39.462 --> 02:41.022
I'm sorry an innocuous
statement of support

02:41.023 --> 02:42.581
affects you emotionally.

02:42.582 --> 02:44.082
Voters should remember,

02:44.083 --> 02:46.225
Mr. Denning is under a
tremendous amount of stress

02:46.226 --> 02:47.168
at this moment.

02:47.169 --> 02:50.141
Don't think this is a reflection
of how he handles pressure.

02:50.142 --> 02:52.636
Okay. Sorry, I'm out of here. No
more questions. Thank you very much.

02:52.637 --> 02:54.617
Mr. Keating, could you
elaborate on your plan...

02:56.429 --> 02:58.847
Ha ha.

02:58.848 --> 03:00.682
Impressive debate technique.

03:00.683 --> 03:03.351
- Yeah. I showed him.
- Yep, showed him.

03:03.352 --> 03:06.488
He reminds me of that idiot
captain in Ashgabat.

03:06.489 --> 03:08.406
No, no, you're thinking
about the one in Jalalabad.

03:08.407 --> 03:10.742
[Laughs] Oh, <i>that</i> guy. He was a tool.

03:10.743 --> 03:12.911
Yes, he was.

03:12.912 --> 03:14.696
Thanks for coming.

03:14.697 --> 03:17.499
You call, I come. What's going on?

03:17.500 --> 03:21.202
[Exhales] We need to find
this Brandy Vargas girl.

03:21.203 --> 03:22.837
'Cause if you can't,

03:22.838 --> 03:25.957
my political career is over
before it even starts.

03:25.958 --> 03:27.759
- Tell me how you met this Brandy.
- [Telephone rings]

03:27.760 --> 03:30.011
She volunteered like the others.

03:30.012 --> 03:32.631
She's a poli-sci major,
wanted to learn the ropes.

03:32.632 --> 03:34.432
You know, it's the oldest
story in the book.

03:34.433 --> 03:36.434
Actually, the oldest story includes...

03:36.435 --> 03:38.720
Oh, come on, Eve, she's just a kid.

03:38.721 --> 03:40.472
Besides, she's not my type.

03:40.473 --> 03:41.890
You know my type.

03:41.891 --> 03:44.726
[Sighs]

03:44.727 --> 03:46.895
Yeah, that ended for
a real good reason.

03:46.896 --> 03:48.897
Yeah, why was that?

03:48.898 --> 03:50.282
- It'll come to me.
- Uh-huh.

03:50.283 --> 03:52.233
Come on. You did the same job as me.

03:52.234 --> 03:53.818
Better than you, actually.

03:53.819 --> 03:56.121
That's adorable.

03:56.122 --> 03:58.206
You know I have to ask.

03:58.207 --> 04:01.058
[Sighs]

04:02.128 --> 04:03.745
Look, I barely spoke to her.

04:03.746 --> 04:06.081
I have no connection
to her or her family.

04:06.082 --> 04:08.917
I left this town right after
we won State in basketball.

04:08.918 --> 04:12.137
Then I came back six months ago
after my last tour of duty.

04:12.138 --> 04:13.888
[Inhales deeply]

04:13.889 --> 04:17.091
Local boy, high school jock, war hero.

04:17.093 --> 04:18.927
Elections have been won on a lot less.

04:18.928 --> 04:21.680
Please. Keating's a
fourth-generation politician.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.231
He's killing me.

04:23.232 --> 04:25.934
Hawthorne's a good town, you
know, it's got good people.

04:25.935 --> 04:27.769
It's just been corrupt for years.

04:27.770 --> 04:29.487
I know I can make a difference.

04:29.488 --> 04:31.606
Help me.

04:31.607 --> 04:33.241
I'm a soft touch for you,

04:33.242 --> 04:35.660
but I need anything you
can give me on Brandy,

04:35.661 --> 04:37.112
on what might've happened.

04:37.113 --> 04:38.697
I don't know what happened.

04:38.698 --> 04:40.498
But I had nothing to do with this,

04:40.499 --> 04:42.701
despite what the press
and the police think...

04:42.702 --> 04:44.619
- What is it?
- Nothing, I just...

04:44.620 --> 04:46.671
[Cell phone rings]

04:46.672 --> 04:48.123
Okay. I'm sorry. I gotta
take this. Excuse me.

04:48.124 --> 04:49.791
This is Sam, yeah?

04:49.792 --> 04:52.043
[Scoffs] You gotta be kidding me.

04:52.044 --> 04:53.712
- Hey. What's... what...
- Hi.

04:53.713 --> 04:56.715
- What are you doing here?
- What are <i>you</i> doing here?

04:56.716 --> 04:58.474
The Clipping Book called us.
There was...

04:58.475 --> 05:00.969
- we're here about a girl that's...
- Missing. Brandy Vargas.

05:00.970 --> 05:02.137
That's why I'm here.

05:02.138 --> 05:03.772
Wait, the Clipping Book sent you?

05:03.773 --> 05:05.523
Thought you were here
visiting a "friend."

05:05.524 --> 05:08.560
Yeah, friend or a... <i>friend</i> friend?

05:08.561 --> 05:10.945
Sam Denning. We served together. He's...

05:10.946 --> 05:12.564
The bloke that everyone
thought killed the girl.

05:12.565 --> 05:14.115
He did not kill the girl.

05:14.116 --> 05:16.201
First, she's missing, not dead.

05:16.202 --> 05:18.452
Second, I know Sam a lot
better than you do.

05:18.453 --> 05:19.154
[Whispering indistinctly]

05:19.155 --> 05:21.539
- What?
- Well, Jones found...

05:21.540 --> 05:23.992
I hacked into your "friend's" phone.

05:23.993 --> 05:28.428
Brandy Vargas texted him
the day she disappeared.

05:31.250 --> 05:34.836
[Indistinct conversations]

05:34.837 --> 05:37.172
Hey, those folks looking
for buttons or posters?

05:37.173 --> 05:38.757
- We need to talk.
- Okay.

05:38.758 --> 05:41.176
What's our rule?
The one rule all this time?

05:41.177 --> 05:44.095
- No lies.
- And you just lied to me.

05:44.096 --> 05:45.222
Not in the way you think.

05:45.223 --> 05:47.232
Oh, now you can tell
lies that aren't lies?

05:47.233 --> 05:49.017
Wow, you really are a politician.

05:49.018 --> 05:52.270
Okay, look, I knew her
more than casually, yes,

05:52.271 --> 05:53.855
but not in that way.

05:53.856 --> 05:55.907
She was working for me on Keating.

05:55.908 --> 05:57.609
She was digging stuff up.

05:57.610 --> 05:59.661
Using an intern for your scut work?

05:59.662 --> 06:01.279
I couldn't do that. You know that.

06:01.280 --> 06:03.865
But she wanted to do it.
She believed in the cause.

06:03.866 --> 06:06.284
[Scoffs] She was trying to impress you.

06:06.285 --> 06:09.170
- Probably.
- What else did you lie about?

06:09.171 --> 06:10.300
Nothing.

06:10.301 --> 06:13.714
Did she try and contact you
the day she disappeared?

06:17.213 --> 06:19.313
Oh, Sam.

06:21.267 --> 06:24.318
Take me to the "usual place."

06:27.189 --> 06:30.290
- [Switch clicking]
- [Machinery whirring in distance]

06:31.861 --> 06:34.028
- You sure this is it?
- [Curtain rings swoosh]

06:34.029 --> 06:36.698
Report said the road worker
saw her run in here.

06:36.699 --> 06:39.200
Well, Denning definitely had
Brandy's GPS on his phone.

06:39.201 --> 06:42.320
Her last text message came
from here, guaranteed.

06:42.321 --> 06:44.906
What is that?

06:44.907 --> 06:47.075
Was something roasting marshmallows?

06:47.076 --> 06:49.077
It's definitely a burn mark.

06:49.078 --> 06:50.745
It's more than a burn.

06:50.746 --> 06:52.797
It's a glyph.

06:52.798 --> 06:54.999
- Sorry, what?
- 17th century.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.634
It's a Puritan symbol.

06:56.635 --> 06:58.336
- What does it mean?
- Devil.

06:58.337 --> 07:00.138
Whoa!

07:00.139 --> 07:02.924
Whoa, ah. So glad you're
not the devil. [Giggles]

07:02.925 --> 07:04.592
Sorry, who are you?

07:04.593 --> 07:06.594
These are my... co-workers

07:06.595 --> 07:09.230
with the... private security firm

07:09.231 --> 07:10.765
I...run.

07:10.766 --> 07:12.100
"Run."

07:12.101 --> 07:14.819
Uh, we're here looking
for Brandy Vargas.

07:14.820 --> 07:16.905
[Whoosh]

07:16.906 --> 07:18.740
Well, I can tell you, she
sure as hell isn't here.

07:18.741 --> 07:20.924
- Whoa!
- Aah!

07:24.280 --> 07:26.296
[Whoosh]

07:39.065 --> 07:40.813
Figured you're still a double shot cap.

07:40.814 --> 07:45.231
I'll bet you're still a non-fat
triple shot latte, right?

07:50.144 --> 07:52.095
So this is nice, huh?

07:52.096 --> 07:54.097
After all these years,

07:54.098 --> 07:56.817
we can still talk over coffee...

07:56.818 --> 07:58.735
Okay, I'm sorry, seriously?

07:58.736 --> 08:00.687
Were you gonna just blow by this thing?

08:00.688 --> 08:02.355
Why did Brandy's body
just suddenly appear

08:02.356 --> 08:03.990
and fall through the ceiling?

08:03.991 --> 08:05.275
Who's lying now, Eve?

08:05.276 --> 08:07.110
- I'm not lying.
- Oh, come on!

08:07.111 --> 08:08.912
A-a private security firm, really?

08:08.913 --> 08:10.614
You got a kid, some cute chick,

08:10.615 --> 08:12.282
and a guy who looks like
he's a bar fighter.

08:12.283 --> 08:14.284
And a scorched body just
falls out of thin air?

08:14.285 --> 08:16.786
You know, you got all high
and mighty with me before,

08:16.787 --> 08:18.955
but you are lying through
your teeth right now.

08:18.956 --> 08:20.973
You think Cassandra's cute?

08:22.960 --> 08:24.928
[Sighs]

08:24.929 --> 08:27.396
[Clears throat]

08:29.884 --> 08:34.403
Magic... is... real.

08:38.442 --> 08:40.477
Wow.

08:40.477 --> 08:42.863
Wow. [Chuckles]

08:42.864 --> 08:44.314
You know what? You don't wanna tell me?

08:44.315 --> 08:46.066
- That's fine. I don't care.
- Magic is real.

08:46.067 --> 08:47.817
- Yeah?
- And we're... my team...

08:47.818 --> 08:49.903
our... our job is to keep it in check,

08:49.904 --> 08:52.822
to keep it out of the hands
of those who would use it...

08:52.823 --> 08:54.374
For evil instead of good?

08:54.375 --> 08:57.377
[Laughs] You sound like
a freaking theme park ride.

08:57.378 --> 08:59.129
You saw it, Sam!

08:59.130 --> 09:02.999
My team shows up wherever
magic is happening. You saw it.

09:03.000 --> 09:06.136
Oh, come on. If that were
true, people would know.

09:06.137 --> 09:07.804
People <i>do</i> know. We know.

09:07.805 --> 09:10.390
It's like when we used
to hunt WMDs, Sam.

09:10.391 --> 09:12.309
You have to secure the threat.

09:12.310 --> 09:14.094
If Brandy was killed
because she uncovered

09:14.095 --> 09:15.845
some magical threat,
then the town of Hawthorne

09:15.846 --> 09:19.114
is facing something
akin to a loose nuke.

09:23.354 --> 09:26.489
The glyph doesn't mean <i>"the</i> devil."

09:26.490 --> 09:29.442
It means <i>"a</i> devil" or "demon." Catch.

09:29.443 --> 09:32.162
Many evil creatures throughout time

09:32.163 --> 09:34.030
have taken the name "devil."

09:34.031 --> 09:36.032
You know, kind of a shorthand, right?

09:36.033 --> 09:39.869
But make no mistake...
very powerful foe.

09:39.870 --> 09:44.507
- Well, what do they want?
- Souls, hence the whole... devil... thing.

09:44.508 --> 09:46.376
They feed on souls.

09:46.377 --> 09:48.845
Well, is it like...
does it take human form?

09:48.846 --> 09:51.014
Or is it like a weird-ass
monster or what?

09:51.015 --> 09:53.850
Mr. Stone, the thing to remember
about devils is that they will

09:53.851 --> 09:55.468
never appear in a red cape and horns.

09:55.469 --> 10:00.473
They will come dressed as
everything you ever wished for.

10:00.474 --> 10:04.561
- So we should look for...
- Katy Perry wearing the Crown Jewels

10:04.562 --> 10:06.196
holding a wad of cash

10:06.197 --> 10:08.964
with an unnatural attraction
to young Aussie boys.

10:11.235 --> 10:12.786
So it could be one of the candidates.

10:12.787 --> 10:14.287
Could be anything, anyone.

10:14.288 --> 10:15.789
That's why you need
to read these books.

10:15.790 --> 10:17.457
You got any abridged versions on tape?

10:17.458 --> 10:19.242
Because we're kind of busy.

10:19.243 --> 10:22.045
Very well, and so what you
need to find is the Contract.

10:22.046 --> 10:23.254
What does a Contract look like?

10:23.255 --> 10:25.248
You know, almost every demon
works via a Contract.

10:25.249 --> 10:27.917
Something you desire
in exchange for your soul.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.552
Kind of like Robert Johnson
down at the crossroads.

10:29.553 --> 10:32.088
Very good, sir. Yes, one of
the better known examples.

10:32.089 --> 10:35.008
Also including lottery winners,
folks who hate the Cubs,

10:35.009 --> 10:37.560
- the moon landing farce.
- Wait, the moon landing wasn't real?

10:37.561 --> 10:39.429
Oh, no, not that one.

10:39.430 --> 10:42.432
So someone made a deal with
the devil to kill Brandy Vargas

10:42.433 --> 10:43.850
in exchange for... what?

10:43.851 --> 10:45.235
Maybe something she found out.

10:45.236 --> 10:46.603
To win the election?

10:46.604 --> 10:48.938
President, maybe.
But a small-town mayor?

10:48.939 --> 10:52.075

10:52.076 --> 10:54.110

11:03.421 --> 11:05.088
Well, Jenkins just said we needed it.

11:05.089 --> 11:07.090
I didn't... well, I didn't mean...

11:07.091 --> 11:08.508

the phone that <i>he</i> stole.

11:20.471 --> 11:23.306

Baird's friend from winning.

11:23.307 --> 11:25.308
My money is on Baird's "friend."

that air quote thingy?

11:27.529 --> 11:28.768

11:30.147 --> 11:32.399
And besides, if Baird
trusts him, so should we.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.984
Colonel Baird sees
the best in everybody.

11:34.985 --> 11:36.369
That's a character flaw.

11:36.370 --> 11:39.155

11:39.156 --> 11:41.491

Is that a flaw?

11:41.492 --> 11:46.496
Everybody sees the best in me.
I'm Ezekiel Jones.

11:46.497 --> 11:48.331

11:48.332 --> 11:50.300

11:50.301 --> 11:54.003
Lightning must've fried all the codes.

11:54.004 --> 11:57.223
No, that's not a code problem.
That's magic.

11:57.224 --> 12:00.260
Some sort of blocking spell.
It's not Hittite.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.594

12:06.100 --> 12:09.185
Yeah, we just need to find
that greenish bluish stuff

12:09.186 --> 12:13.189

stop a blocking spell

12:13.190 --> 12:15.408

- No, we are "legend."

12:28.255 --> 12:30.590
Hey, let's just see
what she's got in there.

12:30.591 --> 12:33.376
The Keating family goes
back to the 17th century,

12:33.377 --> 12:35.512
same time as the glyph in the motel.

12:35.513 --> 12:38.715
So Obediah Keating helps found
the township of Hawthorne

12:38.716 --> 12:42.051
in 1655 by brokering peace
with the Pennacook Indians.

12:42.052 --> 12:44.554
Garrison Keating has a line
on the Underground Railroad.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.222
Anyplace somebody's
doing something good,

12:46.223 --> 12:47.524

12:47.525 --> 12:49.526
Yeah, and the glyph is as well.

12:49.527 --> 12:52.228
Joshua Keating wears it as a lapel pin.

12:52.229 --> 12:55.148
Branford Keating has
monogrammed handkerchiefs.

12:55.149 --> 12:57.117
This creature signs his work.

12:57.118 --> 12:59.452
And this is where he collects.

Hawthorne has a history

13:09.964 --> 13:12.382
replete with tragedy, but every time,

13:12.383 --> 13:14.300
there is a Keating offering aid.

13:14.301 --> 13:16.336
Who's this guy? Huh? This...
Look at this guy right here.

13:16.337 --> 13:20.590
Look, this picture's from 1884.
I swear, that's the same guy.

13:20.591 --> 13:22.592
1928 right after the train crash.

13:22.593 --> 13:24.561
That's our guy.

13:24.562 --> 13:26.095
- What guy?
- That guy.

13:26.096 --> 13:27.764
Brandy had a lot of
research on her phone

13:27.765 --> 13:29.432
all related to the Keatings.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.401
Yeah, but that guy appeared
in the research, too,

13:31.402 --> 13:33.653
- in every story about every disaster.
- It's not a Keating?

13:33.654 --> 13:36.189
No, a Sesselman, but a different
first name every time.

13:36.190 --> 13:39.442
Uh, Cole, Durham, Rory, all
with the Sesselman surname.

13:39.443 --> 13:41.244
Yeah, and the dates of the disaster

13:41.245 --> 13:43.780

Sesselman appears in the photos.

14:00.181 --> 14:02.048
and the next Contract comes due...

Now.

14:05.052 --> 14:06.792

we get a photograph?

14:07.533 --> 14:09.305
Hi. Yeah, let's get a picture.

Mr. Sesselman is a soul
contractor or executor,

- as they prefer...
- Oh, like I care what they prefer.

14:39.252 --> 14:42.242
Colonel, they are very
dangerous creatures.

14:42.243 --> 14:44.223
Hard to stop, nearly
impossible to kill.

14:44.224 --> 14:47.393
So he's old and he's powerful.
The usual drill.

14:47.394 --> 14:49.428

- The Contract.

14:54.100 --> 14:56.735
Anyone threaten the good
fortune of the signer,

14:56.736 --> 14:58.771
the Contract will arrange circumstances

14:58.772 --> 15:00.356
for that person's destruction.

15:00.357 --> 15:01.454
So how does he kill 'em?

15:01.455 --> 15:04.443
The executor actually gets all
of his power from the Contract.

15:04.444 --> 15:06.328

signatory's deepest desires.

Are we talking <i>soul</i> soul here?

15:18.625 --> 15:20.544
Well, if you're asking me
what happens after you die,

15:20.545 --> 15:22.537
I remind you, I'm one of
the least qualified people

15:22.538 --> 15:24.478
to answer that.
But, for now, let's think of

15:24.479 --> 15:26.488
the soul as life energy.
We've encountered creatures

15:26.489 --> 15:28.888
who feed off that kind of energy before.

15:28.889 --> 15:30.305
So it's a parasite?

15:30.306 --> 15:32.190
It feeds off the misery
caused by the Contract

15:32.191 --> 15:34.397
and then consumes the signatory
once the Contract comes due.

15:34.398 --> 15:35.811
Then that's how we get him.

15:35.812 --> 15:37.195
It's a deal with the devil.

15:37.196 --> 15:39.865
If we can't feed the
devil, we beat the deal.

15:39.866 --> 15:41.984
- How do we find it?
- Something that valuable,

15:41.985 --> 15:44.319
the family will keep it very close.

15:44.320 --> 15:47.698
Here. Keating owns half the town.

gonna narrow it down.

Just lean back and listen to Dr. Jones.

15:55.210 --> 15:57.794
- Uh-huh.
- So the Contract is 200 years old,

15:57.795 --> 16:00.013
which means they don't wanna
move it around at all.

16:00.014 --> 16:02.015
So it can't be in any
of the newer buildings.

16:02.016 --> 16:04.718
That cuts these out, doesn't it?

16:04.719 --> 16:06.636
Exactly. Anyway, according to this,

16:06.637 --> 16:08.219
there's three older buildings in town.

16:08.220 --> 16:09.918

rooms to search.

into the security database,

there's space between these walls...

16:32.431 --> 16:34.882

16:34.883 --> 16:36.634
Yeah. Anyway, once we're inside,

we should look for some kind
of magical security system...

a-a way to walk out with it in hand.

to drop it off for a pickup.

Yep. No. Yeah. No, that guy's real.

30:26.369 --> 30:30.288
So very real. And that was a good try.

30:30.289 --> 30:32.574
It was more than just a try.

30:32.575 --> 30:35.377
We made the gas stop getting out.

30:35.378 --> 30:40.465
Well, sadly, even if you have
stopped this explosion,

30:40.466 --> 30:43.418
the... the power of the
Contract will simply cause

30:43.419 --> 30:47.089
a train to derail or a-a dam to burst.

30:47.090 --> 30:48.974
What?

30:48.975 --> 30:51.009
Sam needs to be a hero.

30:51.010 --> 30:55.063
The Contract will make that
happen one way or another.

30:55.064 --> 31:00.986
Oh, these fumes will
kill you all very soon.

31:00.987 --> 31:03.572
Perhaps we could make a deal.

31:03.573 --> 31:06.674
[Indistinct conversations]

31:10.113 --> 31:12.531
I could probably save
most of them if I react...

31:12.532 --> 31:14.950
Most? Are you listening to yourself?

31:14.951 --> 31:17.119
Since when do we settle for "most"?

31:17.120 --> 31:19.287
Just talking here, Sam.

31:19.288 --> 31:20.946
Not doing anything
but just talking to you.

31:20.947 --> 31:22.303
No, you're trying to talk me out of it.

31:22.304 --> 31:24.806
There's no reason to do
this, Captain Denning.

31:24.807 --> 31:26.080
None of this has to happen.

31:26.081 --> 31:27.685
There are ways of
breaking these contracts.

31:27.686 --> 31:29.186
Who's he? What are you, a magician?

31:29.187 --> 31:32.389
Librarian. No, actually,
I'm neither. I'm...

31:32.390 --> 31:35.408
You two go ahead.

31:35.409 --> 31:37.027
Let us help, Sam.

31:37.028 --> 31:38.695
And what? Just keep things status quo?

31:38.696 --> 31:40.614
Keating continues the old boy network?

31:40.615 --> 31:43.116
Good people in this town
never get a fair shake?

31:43.117 --> 31:44.618
I could change that. I could fix that.

31:44.619 --> 31:47.704
Not like this.

31:47.705 --> 31:49.388
[Sighs]

31:56.214 --> 31:57.681
[Grunts] Ah!

31:57.682 --> 32:01.218
Now we're even.

32:01.219 --> 32:02.969
Absolutely sure this is a good idea?

32:02.970 --> 32:07.607
This is a good plan if you
are who I think you are.

32:07.608 --> 32:09.575
[Click pen]

32:12.396 --> 32:15.065
[Horn honking, tires screeching]

32:15.066 --> 32:16.399
MAN: Watch where you're going!

32:16.400 --> 32:19.202
MAN: Hey, get out of the road, old man!

32:19.203 --> 32:22.038
Old man? You have no idea.

32:22.039 --> 32:24.541
You could all walk out
of here right now.

32:24.542 --> 32:27.661
I summon a Contract, you sign it.

32:27.662 --> 32:29.996
All is well.

32:29.997 --> 32:32.415
[Weakly] If you...

32:32.416 --> 32:34.251
[Breathes heavily]

32:34.252 --> 32:36.219
If you think we're actually gonna...

32:36.220 --> 32:38.088
make a deal with the devil, then...

32:38.089 --> 32:39.589
[Breathes heavily]

32:39.590 --> 32:42.225
...just to save our own lives...

32:42.226 --> 32:45.428
...you must not have
met any Librarians.

32:45.429 --> 32:47.764
[Chuckles] But I've met
a lot of human beings.

32:47.765 --> 32:51.351
I'm offering you a fair deal.

32:51.352 --> 32:53.486
Well, sorry, man.

32:53.487 --> 32:58.408
I think we like our souls
right where they're at.

32:58.409 --> 33:00.443
You understand that you will die here?

33:00.444 --> 33:02.279
Or you could sign the Contract.

33:02.280 --> 33:04.414
Any one of you could sign the Contract.

33:04.415 --> 33:06.750
You, Ezekiel, you could travel the world,

33:06.751 --> 33:08.451
every inch of it.

33:08.452 --> 33:11.204
Go places no one has ever seen before.

33:11.205 --> 33:13.290
You're a swashbuckler, Ezekiel,

33:13.291 --> 33:15.458
in a world of accountants.

33:15.459 --> 33:18.261
You really could save the world.

33:18.262 --> 33:21.631
Every week, twice before Friday.

33:21.632 --> 33:25.617
[Breathing heavily]

33:26.771 --> 33:32.225
And you, Cassandra, you
could be healthy again.

33:32.226 --> 33:36.646
You could live a long
life of science and magic

33:36.647 --> 33:41.117
without that death clock
ticking away in your brain.

33:41.118 --> 33:44.788
You could usher in a
golden age of mathemagics,

33:44.789 --> 33:48.557
end so much suffering.

33:50.461 --> 33:52.829
You, sir,

33:52.830 --> 33:56.166
you could defeat Prospero,
save your friends.

33:56.167 --> 33:58.168
Yes, yes, yes. Yes.

33:58.169 --> 34:01.603
Now do you see what I'm offering?

34:03.724 --> 34:06.108
Maybe one of us should take the hit.

34:08.429 --> 34:13.266
Maybe... we can find something
in the Library after.

34:13.266 --> 34:15.351
Exactly.

34:15.353 --> 34:17.687
[Grunts]

34:17.688 --> 34:20.190
Let me summon the Contract,

34:20.190 --> 34:22.275
and I will have my first Librarian.

34:22.275 --> 34:23.743
[Whoosh]

34:23.744 --> 34:26.830
- Seriously? One punch?
- You were always a lightweight.

34:26.831 --> 34:29.666
Well played, Eve.

34:29.667 --> 34:31.868
You figured out that you could
put your name over Sam's

34:31.869 --> 34:34.371
- to void his Contract.
- Wait, what?

34:34.371 --> 34:37.373
- Not my first rodeo, Sess.
- Don't call me that.

34:37.375 --> 34:39.592
But you actually haven't made a wish.

34:39.592 --> 34:42.462
And running out the clock
is not a plan. I'm eternal.

34:42.463 --> 34:45.547
Sooner or later, you're going
to have to make that wish.

34:45.549 --> 34:47.384
Because until you do, the original terms

34:47.385 --> 34:49.135
of the Contract go on to completion.

34:49.136 --> 34:52.472
The town still goes boom,
and your little friends,

34:52.473 --> 34:55.391
I daresay, are not long for this world.

34:55.393 --> 34:59.729
So whatever it is you think
you have in your bag of tricks,

34:59.730 --> 35:01.314
you can't beat me.

35:01.315 --> 35:03.233
I don't do tricks. I make plans.

35:03.234 --> 35:05.235
I exploit the enemy's weaknesses.

35:05.236 --> 35:07.404
You think I have weaknesses?

35:07.405 --> 35:09.406
I know if you engage
an entrenched enemy

35:09.407 --> 35:11.074
with overwhelming resources,

35:11.075 --> 35:14.309
- it's a good idea to bring a tank... Sess.
- [Scoffs]

35:20.801 --> 35:23.753
- [Ceiling rumbling]
- Oh, God.

35:23.754 --> 35:26.806
[Grunting]

35:26.807 --> 35:28.641
How's that superiority thing going?

35:28.642 --> 35:31.177
The Contract always finds a way.

35:31.178 --> 35:33.596
Ah, and there it is.

35:33.597 --> 35:35.598
In five minutes, a commuter
jet is going to crash

35:35.599 --> 35:37.267
into Hawthorne Square.

35:37.268 --> 35:40.236
There will be three survivors

35:40.237 --> 35:43.356
rescued by our heroic
Captain Denning here.

35:43.357 --> 35:45.608
Everyone else in the
plane and on the Square

35:45.609 --> 35:46.776
is going to die.

35:46.777 --> 35:49.779
So you can try to cheat me again,

35:49.780 --> 35:51.713
or you can make your wish.

35:58.408 --> 35:59.741
I won't do it.

35:59.742 --> 36:00.992
Then everyone's going to die.

36:00.993 --> 36:02.155
You can't force me to do it.

36:02.156 --> 36:04.066
Sam, my friend, you're gonna be a hero,

36:04.067 --> 36:06.300
the type they write songs about.

36:07.479 --> 36:09.196
- 45 seconds.
- [Whoosh]

36:09.197 --> 36:10.747
[Latch clanks]

36:13.652 --> 36:15.903
I'm billing you for the suit.

36:15.904 --> 36:19.373
The Contract cannot kill
what cannot be killed.

36:19.374 --> 36:22.809
[Clicks tongue]
Now you're starting to get it.

36:24.414 --> 36:26.347
[Whoosh]

36:27.667 --> 36:29.501
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

36:29.502 --> 36:30.752
I wish you were a human being.

36:30.753 --> 36:32.588
Oh! There it is. You've made a mis...

36:32.589 --> 36:34.939
What did you say?

36:37.809 --> 36:40.345
- What's... what's happening to him?
- He's becoming normal.

36:40.346 --> 36:44.232
[Gasping, heartbeat thumping]

36:44.233 --> 36:47.653
[Breathing heavily]

36:47.654 --> 36:49.271
What have you done to me?

36:49.272 --> 36:51.773
Unh-unh! No more
destroying things for you.

36:51.774 --> 36:53.825
And if you can't do that,
then guess what?

36:53.826 --> 36:55.944
You're in breach of contract.

36:55.945 --> 36:58.864
I'm human.

36:58.865 --> 37:02.501
I've been made a mortal.
What am I to do now?!

37:02.502 --> 37:04.369
I don't know! Exercise. Eat right.

37:04.370 --> 37:05.754
Look both ways crossing the street.

37:05.755 --> 37:07.756
- It's all any of us have.
- [Cell phone rings]

37:07.757 --> 37:10.876
- Ow! Get out of here!
- I can't wait to take this call.

37:10.877 --> 37:15.430
Jenkins! Day officially saved.
Devil officially vanquished.

37:15.431 --> 37:19.468
Huh? Oh, yeah. Sam's good.

37:19.469 --> 37:20.886
Yeah.

37:20.887 --> 37:23.722
Oh, it hurts! In places
I didn't know hurt.

37:23.723 --> 37:26.274
I'm sorry I was nearly
party to something...

37:26.275 --> 37:27.643
[Inhales deeply]

37:27.644 --> 37:29.561
I don't know, something.
I'm still processing.

37:29.562 --> 37:35.901
I told you, magic's like a...
monkey with a loaded AK-47.

37:35.902 --> 37:37.486
- But you got out alive.
- Yeah.

37:37.487 --> 37:39.071
We both know that's all that counts.

37:39.072 --> 37:42.290
Besides, I always had faith
you'd do the right thing.

37:42.291 --> 37:44.910
Yeah, well, faith's hard
to come by in our work.

37:44.911 --> 37:47.996
It's just about seeing the unseen.

37:47.997 --> 37:51.633
So do you have any
openings at this Library?

37:51.634 --> 37:53.969
They're more of a recruiting type unit.

37:53.970 --> 37:56.388
Plus, you've got a campaign to run.

37:56.389 --> 38:01.393
Please, after this, I'll be
lucky to get elected janitor.

38:01.394 --> 38:03.762
You're better than you think you are.

38:03.763 --> 38:06.914
I can do more than I think I can.

38:10.069 --> 38:12.419
Don't ever forget it.

38:18.528 --> 38:20.010
[Whoosh]

38:25.001 --> 38:29.520
Wait, Eve, listen. Do you...

38:31.708 --> 38:32.958
Eve?

38:32.959 --> 38:34.475
[Door squeaks]

38:40.800 --> 38:42.551
There's no way I'm drinking this.

38:42.552 --> 38:44.027
[Nasal voice] It smells
like a camel's behind.

38:44.028 --> 38:45.850
Natural gas poisoning can cause

38:45.851 --> 38:47.939
permanent nervous
system damage, Mr. Stone.

38:47.940 --> 38:50.609
- Oh, no.
- Oh, good.

38:50.610 --> 38:54.211
I've got a nice bottomless hole for you.

38:56.399 --> 38:58.734
Now please rest, all of you.

38:58.735 --> 39:01.486
Sleep if you can.

39:01.487 --> 39:04.706
The elixir should heal you
in about three hours.

39:04.707 --> 39:08.493
Eight if you don't keep still.

39:08.494 --> 39:11.496
Thank you, Mr. Jenkins.

39:11.497 --> 39:14.750
I once knew a medic with
your bedside manner.

39:14.751 --> 39:17.886
Never wanted to run
a mission without her.

39:17.887 --> 39:19.671
Yeah, well, I've always
considered myself

39:19.672 --> 39:21.506
more of a caretaker than anything else,

39:21.507 --> 39:22.891
even in the old days.

39:22.892 --> 39:26.394
Even in the <i>old,</i> old days.

39:26.395 --> 39:27.846
It suits you.

39:27.847 --> 39:29.431
One doesn't live this long

39:29.432 --> 39:31.850
without learning how to
repair broken bodies.

39:31.851 --> 39:37.155
[Lowered voice] Well,
they wouldn't need repairing

39:37.156 --> 39:38.824
if I'd been on point.

39:38.825 --> 39:41.910
Ah, so you think your job
is to keep them safe?

39:41.911 --> 39:44.696
Guardian? Kind of in the job title.

39:44.697 --> 39:46.865
Colonel Baird, I think
you may be laboring

39:46.866 --> 39:48.700
under a slight misapprehension.

39:48.701 --> 39:51.536
A Guardian's job is not to
protect the Librarian's body.

39:51.537 --> 39:55.173
We used to go through
Librarians like penny candy.

39:55.174 --> 39:56.591
What are you saying?

39:56.592 --> 40:00.277
I'm here to carry the
Librarians' luggage?

40:02.048 --> 40:04.549
Librarians die.

40:04.550 --> 40:07.552
But there is a much greater risk.

40:07.553 --> 40:11.606
To be surrounded by all of this magic,

40:11.607 --> 40:13.975
to know that you could change things,

40:13.976 --> 40:15.644
that you could fix things

40:15.645 --> 40:17.896
and not succumb to that
temptation, well...

40:17.897 --> 40:21.999
not very many good people
can bear that burden alone.

40:24.153 --> 40:28.657
The Librarian before
Mr. Carsen didn't die.

40:28.658 --> 40:33.829
He gave in to the siren
song of all of this power.

40:33.830 --> 40:37.147
He gave in. Then he was lost.

40:38.751 --> 40:40.752
They will not survive in this world

40:40.753 --> 40:42.921
without someone there
holding them steady.

40:42.922 --> 40:45.807
I told you once, the
Library did not choose you

40:45.808 --> 40:47.592
for your ability to kill.

40:47.593 --> 40:52.229
The Guardian's job is not to
save the Librarians' bodies.

40:52.230 --> 40:54.747
It is to save their souls.

40:56.569 --> 40:59.370
And you did that
admirably today, Colonel.
