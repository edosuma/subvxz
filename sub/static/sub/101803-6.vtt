WEBVTT

00:09.139 --> 00:10.793
<i>Previously on</i>

00:12.403 --> 00:14.405
Jace!

00:14.449 --> 00:16.407
Whole task force has torn
Tunisia apart.

00:16.451 --> 00:19.193
<i>The longer it takes to find him, the worse his chances get.</i>

00:19.236 --> 00:22.109
What am I supposed to do,
just sit here alone?

00:22.152 --> 00:24.198
<i>I didn't realize that
you and Naima stayed in touch.</i>

00:24.241 --> 00:25.416
She's just one of
those lovely people.

00:25.460 --> 00:26.939
You know, you come
into their life once,

00:26.983 --> 00:28.071
and it's for good.

00:29.855 --> 00:31.901
How do you stay sane?Faith.

00:35.209 --> 00:37.037
[grunts]Ray's trained to do

00:37.080 --> 00:39.300
<i>whatever it takes
to escape and survive.</i>

01:06.457 --> 01:08.764
Let's go. Get up.

01:10.766 --> 01:14.813
Up.

03:25.857 --> 03:27.381
Hey.Yep?

03:27.424 --> 03:29.383
You should be resting.Okay, thanks, Dad.

03:29.426 --> 03:31.776
I'll be sleepingwhen we get Ray.

03:31.820 --> 03:33.865
Ease up on yourself,
all right?

03:33.909 --> 03:36.085
If it wasn't for Bravo, we
wouldn't know he was trafficked

03:36.128 --> 03:38.043
through El Kantaoui and...

03:38.087 --> 03:39.871
on a ship
somewhere in the Mediterranean.

03:39.915 --> 03:41.873
There's lots of ships
move in and out of there.

03:41.917 --> 03:44.615
It's taking Davis some time tofigure out which one Ray was on.

03:44.659 --> 03:46.182
The fact that
you're not hounding her

03:46.226 --> 03:47.531
tells me that
you trust she's on it.

03:47.575 --> 03:48.793
Yeah, well,
the window's closing.

03:48.837 --> 03:50.099
We all want him back, Jason.

03:50.142 --> 03:51.448
Ray's family. We need him back.

03:53.058 --> 03:54.625
Hey, I got something.

03:54.669 --> 03:57.106
Intel from the shophouse
employee suggests

03:57.149 --> 03:59.891
that Ray left the port
of El Kantaoui approximately 48

03:59.935 --> 04:01.415
to 72 hours ago.

04:01.458 --> 04:03.460
There were 18 vessels thatdeparted during that time frame.

04:03.504 --> 04:05.332
We don't have
enough manpower

04:05.375 --> 04:07.072
to track that many ships.We don't need it.

04:07.116 --> 04:09.161
Checking the manifests
and looking for anomalies,

04:09.205 --> 04:12.513
I was able to single out
a container ship, the <i>Aafrah.</i>

04:12.556 --> 04:14.210
Ray's on that ship?

04:14.254 --> 04:15.820
Now?The manifestsare fabricated,

04:15.864 --> 04:18.127
the pattern of movement doesn'ttrack for a commercial vessel,

04:18.170 --> 04:19.998
and they are running faster
and burning more fuel

04:20.042 --> 04:21.913
than makes economic sense.Yeah.

04:21.957 --> 04:24.568
Racing to get their precious
cargo to its destination.

04:24.612 --> 04:26.483
Which is where?Syria.

04:27.876 --> 04:30.400
Right in the belly of the beast.Which port?Latakia.

04:30.444 --> 04:33.011
They're hugging the coastline,so they should be therein about eight hours.

04:33.055 --> 04:35.579
Good news is it's one of the fewplaces in country that's stable.

04:35.623 --> 04:37.581
We lose initiativeif he gets to that port.

04:37.625 --> 04:39.583
We got to hit in open water now.

04:39.627 --> 04:42.238
Davis, how certain are you
that Ray's on that ship?

04:42.282 --> 04:44.762
It's the first thing I've beensure of since we got to Tunisia.All right.

04:44.806 --> 04:46.721
Warning order en route.Round up your team

04:46.764 --> 04:48.766
and get them ready
for a maritime interdiction.

04:51.813 --> 04:54.511
The vessel carrying Ray is a
feeder class container ship.

04:54.555 --> 04:56.121
We know how many pax on board?

04:56.165 --> 04:58.123
Given the manifests
are bogus, no telling.

04:58.167 --> 04:59.560
But we have seen
up to four enemy

04:59.603 --> 05:00.691
at any given time topside,

05:00.735 --> 05:02.345
sometimes armed,
sometimes not.

05:02.389 --> 05:05.087
Not to be a Debbie, but how sureare we that Ray's still alive?

05:05.130 --> 05:06.871
Based on AKM's
past tactics,

05:06.915 --> 05:08.351
techniques and procedures,

05:08.395 --> 05:10.353
they'll likely have plans
for him in Syria.

05:10.397 --> 05:12.573
Getting an American onto
their turf and exploiting him

05:12.616 --> 05:14.052
is a prime opportunity
for propaganda

05:14.096 --> 05:15.750
and recruiting purposes.

05:15.793 --> 05:17.491
Particularly if they're aware
that Ray's military.

05:17.534 --> 05:19.710
Which is why the boat's nevergonna make it to port. Got it?

05:19.754 --> 05:21.582
You know the drill,
right? Zodiac goes

05:21.625 --> 05:22.583
in the water, we jump after it.

05:22.626 --> 05:23.714
All right, jock up, boys.

05:23.758 --> 05:25.281
Ray's waiting on you.

05:52.003 --> 05:54.528
Okay.

06:10.108 --> 06:13.111
If you're watching
this video, it...

06:13.155 --> 06:15.113
means the worst has happened.

06:18.290 --> 06:20.684
Whoever sees this...

06:20.728 --> 06:23.818
I want you to know
I died doing what I loved.

06:25.863 --> 06:29.650
I am not afraid
of what's coming.

06:29.693 --> 06:31.695
Know that.

06:33.654 --> 06:37.440
I only...

06:37.484 --> 06:39.660
I only wish I had more time.

06:39.703 --> 06:42.706
With each of you.

06:42.750 --> 06:45.056
My brothers. My family.

06:46.362 --> 06:48.582
Jameelah.

06:48.625 --> 06:51.193
RJ.

06:51.236 --> 06:52.629
Naima.

06:55.371 --> 06:58.200
I am so, so sorry.

07:01.246 --> 07:03.901
I love you. I love you so much.

07:49.077 --> 07:50.382
One minute!

07:50.426 --> 07:52.950
[indistinct shouts]One minute! One minute!

08:05.659 --> 08:07.399
Hey.

08:07.443 --> 08:09.576
You good?

08:09.619 --> 08:11.099
Yeah.

08:11.142 --> 08:13.493
Before all this, I called Ray
a selfish son of a bitch.

08:13.536 --> 08:17.453
Just can't let that be the
last thing I say to him.It won't be.

08:22.414 --> 08:25.069
Hey, we're gonna miss
our drop zone!

08:25.113 --> 08:26.070
What's going on?!

08:26.114 --> 08:27.594
The boat changed course.

08:27.637 --> 08:29.073
It appears to be headed
into port.

08:29.117 --> 08:30.901
We'll call an audible.
We're still going.

08:30.945 --> 08:33.077
That boat's gonna make port
before you can hit it.

08:33.121 --> 08:34.818
You got to be
kidding me.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.258
Our shot at Ray just got canc'd.

08:45.568 --> 08:47.048
Can't believe
we're missing Ray by minutes.

08:47.091 --> 08:48.963
That damn pilot was riding
the brake up there.

08:49.006 --> 08:50.530
Not hitting them at sea,
we lose our tactical advantage.

08:50.573 --> 08:52.575
Look, Thirty, we are the
tactical advantage, you got it?

08:52.619 --> 08:53.794
All right, listen,

08:53.837 --> 08:54.838
We got thrown a curveball.

08:54.882 --> 08:56.274
We're gonna adapt.
All right, guys?

08:59.277 --> 09:02.019
The ship's gonna make port
in Tartus in about 15.

09:02.063 --> 09:04.239
Guessing it's not as calm there
as it is in Latakia.

09:04.282 --> 09:06.633
The Syrian regular army
and Russian troops

09:06.676 --> 09:08.983
are engaged with
Al-Khidhir Movement
fighters around the city.

09:09.026 --> 09:11.159
Well, you know what?

09:11.202 --> 09:12.769
We're gonna march
right through hell,

09:12.813 --> 09:14.641
and we're gonna pull him out,
that's what we're gonna do.

09:14.684 --> 09:16.773
Now, look, I know
you're all anxious to go,

09:16.817 --> 09:19.036
but once Ray makes landfall,

09:19.080 --> 09:21.648
the entire game changes--
you'll be working

09:21.691 --> 09:24.172
in a completely
nonpermissive environment.

09:24.215 --> 09:26.043
Syria is an active war zone.

09:26.087 --> 09:28.176
We don't have many friendlies
close to Tartus.

09:28.219 --> 09:30.178
So we HAHO, hit the water,

09:30.221 --> 09:32.659
swim over the beach,
pull Ray out of that gongshow.

09:32.702 --> 09:34.748
Well, hitting a boat
in open water is one thing,

09:34.791 --> 09:38.578
but greenlighting an op
into a tinderbox

09:38.621 --> 09:41.581
with massive geopolitical
ramifications is another.

09:41.624 --> 09:43.583
All we've got right
now is an infil plan

09:43.626 --> 09:45.585
with a giant assumption
stapled to it.

09:45.628 --> 09:48.022
I need a concrete plan

09:48.065 --> 09:50.328
infil, actions-on,

09:50.372 --> 09:52.504
exfil and contingencies.

09:52.548 --> 09:54.550
Let's get to it.

10:37.158 --> 10:39.639
No, no, no, no, no.

10:39.682 --> 10:42.598
No, no, no...

11:07.928 --> 11:09.712
You got eyes on Ray?

11:09.756 --> 11:11.845
Working on it.
You got actions on for me?

11:11.888 --> 11:13.977
It's airtight-- just need
to know what I'm hitting.

11:14.021 --> 11:16.763
Eye in the sky's
about to show us.

11:19.940 --> 11:21.942
There.Okay.

11:31.342 --> 11:32.648
<i>Lost eyes.</i>

11:32.692 --> 11:34.345
Nobody else is
coming off that boat.

11:34.389 --> 11:35.738
Ray must've been in that cluster
that went into the warehouse.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.348
Seems like they knew
that we were watching them.

11:37.392 --> 11:38.915
Yeah, they've adapted
to us and the Russians

11:38.959 --> 11:40.830
running drones
24/7 over the AO.

11:40.874 --> 11:42.571
It's got to be
part of their TTPs now.

11:42.614 --> 11:43.703
Wait.

11:43.746 --> 11:45.139
Maybe they loaded
into that vehicle.

11:48.795 --> 11:49.796
Or that one.

11:49.839 --> 11:51.493
No. No. No, no, no, no.

11:51.536 --> 11:52.755
"No, no, no"? What do
you mean, no, no, no, no?

11:52.799 --> 11:54.191
Get up another
ISR platform.

11:54.235 --> 11:55.845
We don't have one.Do something.

11:55.889 --> 11:56.977
Follow them, will you?

11:57.020 --> 11:58.543
We don't know that Ray's

11:58.587 --> 11:59.893
in one of those cars,
that warehouse--

11:59.936 --> 12:00.981
hell, he could still be
on the same damn boat.

12:01.024 --> 12:02.809
Send us in, will you?!Jason!

12:02.852 --> 12:04.288
You know, we'll
hit the boat.

12:04.332 --> 12:05.202
If they're not at the boat,
we'll hit the warehouse.

12:05.246 --> 12:05.986
If they're not in the warehouse,

12:06.029 --> 12:07.204
we'll hit the buildings!

12:07.248 --> 12:08.771
We'll hit every building
until we find him!

12:08.815 --> 12:10.512
Every single person
on this plane

12:10.555 --> 12:12.862
would gladly exchange
their life for Ray's.

12:12.906 --> 12:14.559
That doesn't mean
he would ask us to.

12:15.909 --> 12:17.562
Now, we cannot send you
into a war zone

12:17.606 --> 12:19.129
without some sense
of Ray's pos.

12:19.173 --> 12:21.218
I'm coordinating with SOCOM.
I'm working HUMINT, SIGINT.

12:21.262 --> 12:22.480
I'm trying to
get them to spin up

12:22.524 --> 12:23.699
additional assets
in the area.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.483
Whatever it takes
to get back on his trail.

12:26.963 --> 12:28.922
Even Ray knew his
best shot of getting

12:28.965 --> 12:30.575
rescued was on that boat.

12:30.619 --> 12:33.317
He's got to be losing
faith right about now.

12:34.405 --> 12:35.842
We were so close.

12:35.885 --> 12:37.626
A couple more minutes and
we would've had him back.

12:37.669 --> 12:40.150
I shouldn't have argued
with you at the shophouse.

12:40.194 --> 12:41.848
It cost us time.

12:41.891 --> 12:43.197
Not your fault.
You did the right thing.

12:43.240 --> 12:44.633
You kept me from
crossing a line

12:44.676 --> 12:46.504
I wouldn't have been
able to uncross.

12:46.548 --> 12:49.290
You were Ray for me
at that moment.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.118
Just feel like
I'm coming up short for him.

12:51.161 --> 12:52.989
Ray's never out of the fight.

13:29.852 --> 13:31.811
Come on.

13:43.474 --> 13:46.434
Damn, four percent.

13:46.477 --> 13:48.175
Oh, God.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.834
Pilot's got us circling.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.836
Have enough fuel to hold
this pattern for eight hours.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.272
Yeah, well, Ray doesn't
have that kind of time.

13:58.315 --> 13:59.969
The Ops Center
at DEVGRU received this call

14:00.013 --> 14:00.927
a few minutes ago.

14:00.970 --> 14:04.756
This is CWO Ray Perry.

14:05.932 --> 14:09.892
The first letter of the color
of the day when I was taken

14:09.936 --> 14:12.068
is "B."

14:12.112 --> 14:14.505
I've been captured by

14:14.549 --> 14:16.725
AKM forces, but...

14:16.768 --> 14:18.901
Well, if he's sending up a
flare, can-can you track that?

14:18.945 --> 14:20.816
The phone won't ping--
maybe he powered it down,

14:20.860 --> 14:22.078
maybe it's out of range,
maybe it's out of battery.

14:22.122 --> 14:24.124
If it powers up again,
I'll find him.

15:00.812 --> 15:02.945
No!

15:02.989 --> 15:05.556
Okay. Okay. Okay.

15:05.600 --> 15:06.557
Okay. Okay.

15:24.097 --> 15:25.968
I got him.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.970
Master Chief,

15:28.014 --> 15:29.537
it's time to bring Ray home.

15:41.984 --> 15:44.944
Ray's phone pinged to a location
in town known as AKM turf.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.162
I've sent the coordinates
to your ATAKs.

15:46.206 --> 15:47.511
Yeah, but
that's the phone,

15:47.555 --> 15:49.339
not the man.That's what we have.

15:49.383 --> 15:52.255
Enough to get us off this
plane and into the sandbox.

15:52.299 --> 15:54.562
So, you're up.What's the situation
on the ground?

15:54.605 --> 15:56.433
Fighting is breaking out
on the outskirts of the city

15:56.477 --> 15:58.870
between Russian forces and AKM.

15:58.914 --> 16:01.525
Might make a good diversion
at least, keep eyes off us.

16:01.569 --> 16:04.441
Till we end up in the middle
of a dirtbag civil war.

16:04.485 --> 16:06.574
ERIC:ROEs keep you
from engaging Russian troops

16:06.617 --> 16:08.184
unless fired upon.

16:08.228 --> 16:09.664
Even then, let's try not

16:09.707 --> 16:11.666
to start World War III
getting Ray back.

16:11.709 --> 16:13.276
We'll stay in the
shadows and avoid

16:13.320 --> 16:15.626
any direct action
that doesn't involve Ray.

16:15.670 --> 16:18.020
We're no good to Ray if we
can't get him out of there.

16:18.064 --> 16:19.369
What's our
extract platform?

16:19.413 --> 16:21.023
There's a number of assets
available.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.546
I'm working on 'em now.Well, you know what?

16:22.590 --> 16:24.026
Ray's gonna be injured,
so don't leave us

16:24.070 --> 16:25.941
hanging in the wind
too long, all right?

16:25.985 --> 16:28.944
You get to Ray,
we'll get you out.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.425
Gonna earn our tridents
today, boys.

17:01.324 --> 17:03.631
My men told me
you escaped your bindings.

17:03.674 --> 17:07.722
You don't look like a magician,
so you are trained, no?

17:09.158 --> 17:10.377
Army?

17:11.987 --> 17:13.249
Marine?

17:41.408 --> 17:45.368
30 seconds!

18:12.352 --> 18:15.311
Havoc, this is 1.
We're passing Road Warrior.

18:15.355 --> 18:16.878
That's a good copy, Bravo 1.

18:16.921 --> 18:18.227
Proceed to Fury Road.

18:18.271 --> 18:19.620
Roger that.

19:27.427 --> 19:29.472
Read it.

19:32.649 --> 19:34.912
As soon as I do, you'll kill me.

20:13.212 --> 20:16.780
No, no.

20:36.539 --> 20:38.498
Havoc, this is 1.
I pass Fury Road.

20:38.541 --> 20:40.239
What's the time to our extract?

20:40.282 --> 20:42.850
Yeah, Bravo 1,
I copy Fury Road. Stand by.

20:42.893 --> 20:45.156
There's an LZ one klick east
of Bravo's current location

20:45.200 --> 20:46.462
the pilots are willing
to land at.

20:46.506 --> 20:47.942
Bravo 1,
this is Havoc.

20:47.985 --> 20:49.509
LZ coordinates are headed
your way now.

20:49.552 --> 20:51.424
Bravo 1,

20:51.467 --> 20:54.165
AKM forces are retreating and
about two klicks from your LZ.

20:54.209 --> 20:55.428
You need to get to that LZ ASAP,

20:55.471 --> 20:56.690
or we need
to secure you a new one.

20:56.733 --> 20:58.300
That's good copy.

20:58.344 --> 21:00.128
It's gonna take some time
to clear the target.

21:00.171 --> 21:03.349
Second they know we're here,
Ray's ass is in the jackpot.

21:03.392 --> 21:04.959
Might want to make
it quiet then.

21:05.002 --> 21:06.482
Ray doesn't have time for quiet.

21:06.526 --> 21:08.310
Make entrance through the front.

21:08.354 --> 21:10.312
Sonny, Metal, move.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.717
Metal, on you.

21:26.894 --> 21:28.199
Go.

21:28.243 --> 21:30.289
Read it.

22:21.775 --> 22:24.952
Naima. Jameelah. RJ.

22:27.433 --> 22:29.348
No. No, no.

22:42.578 --> 22:44.624
Up ahead! Up ahead!
Go, go, go, go, go!

22:48.628 --> 22:50.412
I ain't got time for this!

23:16.438 --> 23:17.874
Sons of bitch ain't even aiming.

23:17.918 --> 23:19.267
Get some rounds
in that doorjamb!

23:19.310 --> 23:20.616
Roger that.

23:21.835 --> 23:22.662
Move! Move!

23:53.301 --> 23:54.737
Crash out!

24:06.749 --> 24:07.837
On me!

24:36.910 --> 24:38.389
Breacher up.

25:00.455 --> 25:01.674
Clear.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.808
How is he? Ray?

25:05.852 --> 25:08.202
Huh? Pulse?

25:09.986 --> 25:12.075
He's alive.

25:14.600 --> 25:17.385
Wake up, man. Come on. Wake up,
Ray. Come on. Give me something.

25:17.428 --> 25:18.734
Wake up.

25:18.778 --> 25:19.822
Come on. We did it. Come on.

25:20.823 --> 25:22.999
We did it. Wake up!

25:23.043 --> 25:26.394
That's it.
Here to bring you home.

25:26.437 --> 25:28.352
You're gonna be okay.Jace.

25:28.396 --> 25:30.398
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm
here. I just need you to fight.

25:30.441 --> 25:32.487
Just need you to fight a little
bit longer, okay, brother?

25:32.531 --> 25:33.749
Get him up.

25:35.621 --> 25:36.491
Havoc, this is 1.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.101
We're passing Thunderdome.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.716
That is a good copy, Bravo 1.

25:45.544 --> 25:46.936
That's the best
I can do here.

25:46.980 --> 25:48.503
Hey, you ready to go home?

25:49.765 --> 25:51.462
I've been ready.

25:51.506 --> 25:53.421
You boys sure took
your sweet-ass time.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.076
Coordinates?

25:56.119 --> 25:58.426
Extract point is
ten mikes out, maybe 15.

25:58.469 --> 26:00.384
On foot.

26:04.345 --> 26:06.303
It's gonna be hard
enough with that leg,

26:06.347 --> 26:07.653
but without shoes?

26:21.580 --> 26:24.452
You can knock Prime Time down,
but you can't knock him out.

26:52.872 --> 26:54.569
Clowns ain't
gonna go easy.

26:54.613 --> 26:55.918
Enemy's got a say
in the fight.

26:55.962 --> 26:58.355
Jace, give me a sidearm.

26:58.399 --> 27:01.010
Are you sure?Need as many guns
as we can get.

27:01.054 --> 27:02.751
That hand lookskind of rough.Yeah.

27:04.927 --> 27:06.799
It's why God gave me two.

27:06.842 --> 27:08.235
There was another guy.

27:08.278 --> 27:11.368
Leadership?I didn't see him.

27:11.412 --> 27:12.805
Jace.

27:12.848 --> 27:16.112
We don't have time to go
after HVTs, you understand?

27:16.156 --> 27:18.158
Help him.

27:18.201 --> 27:20.682
Hey, Thirty, Thirty,
Thirty, I got him.

27:25.513 --> 27:27.820
Welcome back to Bravo,
Warrant Officer Perry.

27:27.863 --> 27:29.604
I got you, buddy.

27:37.786 --> 27:38.831
What the hell was that?

27:38.874 --> 27:41.311
Russian jets.
Fight's getting closer.

27:41.355 --> 27:43.966
Look, Ray's not gonna be able
to make it on foot.

27:45.533 --> 27:48.536
Family Truckster
looks like our salvation.

27:50.277 --> 27:51.495
What's the call, Jace?

27:51.539 --> 27:53.584
Prepare to move!

27:53.628 --> 27:55.630
No.What's up?

27:55.674 --> 27:56.805
Russians are flying sorties.

27:56.849 --> 27:58.720
They're providing CAS
for their troops,

27:58.764 --> 28:01.375
so our air assets are being
blocked from the airspace.

28:01.418 --> 28:02.942
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.

28:02.985 --> 28:04.595
Your LZ's been compromised,

28:04.639 --> 28:07.076
and your air assets
have been denied. How copy?

28:07.120 --> 28:09.296
That's good copy. We're securing
a vehicle right now.

28:09.339 --> 28:10.384
Will update you on the exfil.

28:10.427 --> 28:12.429
Copy that, 1.

28:13.866 --> 28:16.738
You think you can coordinate an
exfil outside the city limits?

28:16.782 --> 28:18.740
The QRF. They'll be southeast.

28:18.784 --> 28:20.611
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.

28:20.655 --> 28:23.440
We'll send down the rendezvous
coordinates with your QRF.

28:23.484 --> 28:26.617
Head to the southeast corner
of the city. Be advised.

28:26.661 --> 28:28.881
Enemy troops are retreating
from Russian offensive

28:28.924 --> 28:30.752
back your way.
How copy?

28:30.796 --> 28:32.667
Good copy, Havoc.
We're Charlie Mike.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.147
You ready to roll?

28:34.190 --> 28:36.627
Didn't make it this
far to tap out now.

28:36.671 --> 28:38.020
All right, let's move!

28:39.718 --> 28:41.937
Move! Move!

28:42.938 --> 28:44.766
Break out!

29:01.391 --> 29:03.176
Ray!

29:26.939 --> 29:28.723
Move!

29:56.229 --> 29:57.578
Think we shook 'em.

29:57.621 --> 29:58.884
Is he good?

29:58.927 --> 30:00.537
I don't know, man.

30:00.581 --> 30:01.887
What do you mean,
you don't know?

30:01.930 --> 30:04.890
Come on, Ray! Hey!

30:04.933 --> 30:07.588
Hang in there, buddy.
We're almost home.

30:14.377 --> 30:16.205
We got company.

30:35.877 --> 30:38.097
Bravo 1, we got you on ISR.
The road is clear up ahead.

30:38.140 --> 30:39.663
You found Bravo a way home?

30:39.707 --> 30:41.013
Copy. Transmitting now.

30:42.797 --> 30:44.233
They're closing fast.

30:44.277 --> 30:47.889
Havoc, this is 1.
I got the coordinates.

30:47.933 --> 30:49.848
Winchester! Winchester!

31:04.906 --> 31:07.604
Man, these guys are persistent!

31:08.779 --> 31:11.652
Ten seconds out.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.929
Rendezvous point's
down that hill! Move!

31:32.238 --> 31:33.848
Move! Move! Move!

31:36.285 --> 31:38.374
Move!

31:54.173 --> 31:56.566
Hey, this is gonna suck.

31:56.610 --> 31:58.264
Keep the faith, brother.

31:58.307 --> 32:00.353
Yeah. Buckle up. Let's go.

32:27.815 --> 32:29.121
Get him up, get him up.

32:30.122 --> 32:31.819
Easy, easy. Watch his leg.

32:31.862 --> 32:32.820
Yeah, it's hit, it's hit.

32:32.863 --> 32:34.474
Bravo's up. Full head count.

32:53.101 --> 32:55.886
The legend grows.That's right.

32:55.930 --> 32:58.541
You know,
I'll deny saying this,

32:58.585 --> 33:01.153
but I'd follow you
anywhere, bro.

33:01.196 --> 33:03.372
Only as good as my teammates.

33:10.814 --> 33:12.816
Come on, now. Look at this.

33:12.860 --> 33:14.470
This is a hell of a lot better

33:14.514 --> 33:17.038
than the coffee you've
been drinking, right?

33:17.082 --> 33:20.563
The entire week
has been a blur, so...

33:20.607 --> 33:22.696
When these, uh,
ops go sideways,

33:22.739 --> 33:24.915
it's hard to shake, right?

33:24.959 --> 33:27.048
Yeah, I guess that's true.

33:27.092 --> 33:30.051
We avoided a
whole lot of pain

33:30.095 --> 33:33.228
'cause of your hard
work. All of us did.

33:33.272 --> 33:37.015
I just pointed the spear
towards Ray.

33:37.058 --> 33:38.886
You did the rest.

33:38.929 --> 33:41.280
Like I said, only as
good as my teammates.

33:41.323 --> 33:43.021
Team.

33:43.064 --> 33:45.327
Cheers.

33:45.371 --> 33:47.851
Think I'm gonna go
enjoy the flight.

33:47.895 --> 33:49.331
Onward.

34:03.998 --> 34:08.046
Not bad, right, for a couple
mothballs from last week.

34:11.875 --> 34:14.835
We going back to those mothballs
after we land?

34:17.055 --> 34:18.969
Yeah.

34:19.013 --> 34:21.624
You know,
before all this started...

34:22.712 --> 34:26.412
...you told me to go out there
and do my job on any team.

34:26.455 --> 34:30.155
That operating's operating.

34:30.198 --> 34:32.070
You're wrong.

34:33.114 --> 34:34.289
I'm wrong. How's that?

34:34.333 --> 34:36.683
Tactically,
it's the same.

34:36.726 --> 34:39.860
But you put a different person
standing next to you, and...

34:39.903 --> 34:41.862
everything changes.

34:41.905 --> 34:43.472
Only thing that matters

34:43.516 --> 34:45.083
are the brothers
to the left of you

34:45.126 --> 34:47.041
and to the right of you.

34:52.438 --> 34:54.440
Don't forget that.

35:21.467 --> 35:23.425
Oh, you're waking up.

35:23.469 --> 35:25.645
We're over, uh...

35:25.688 --> 35:28.561
We're almost home.

35:28.604 --> 35:31.085
Yeah.

35:33.522 --> 35:35.698
Look, Ray, uh,

35:35.742 --> 35:38.614
me blaming you for...

35:38.658 --> 35:41.400
for Bravo's problems, uh...

35:41.443 --> 35:43.576
That wasn't right.

35:44.620 --> 35:47.145
Team was down, and...

35:47.188 --> 35:49.930
you were frustrated.

35:49.973 --> 35:51.540
Yeah.Believe me,

35:51.584 --> 35:53.020
I was questioning
my choices, too.

35:53.063 --> 35:57.155
It's, uh, I got
this really great quality

35:57.198 --> 35:59.983
of, uh, saying
the most horrible things

36:00.027 --> 36:03.073
to people that, uh...

36:05.206 --> 36:07.034
...people that mean
the most to me.

36:07.077 --> 36:09.428
Actions and words, brother.

36:09.471 --> 36:12.257
Yeah.What you boys did...

36:14.041 --> 36:16.261
Putting it on the line
for me, it...

36:19.394 --> 36:24.094
It's easy to make ourselves
expendable for the best of us.

36:25.139 --> 36:26.271
Yeah.

36:28.621 --> 36:30.579
You know, when I
told you to, uh,

36:30.623 --> 36:31.754
start picking up the team,

36:31.798 --> 36:33.234
I didn't mean for you
to do it literally.

36:33.278 --> 36:35.105
Yeah.

36:35.149 --> 36:37.673
Well, somebody had
to carry your ass.Yeah.

36:39.719 --> 36:41.199
All right.

36:41.242 --> 36:43.157
Look at this guy, huh?

36:43.201 --> 36:46.160
I let you out of my sight for
one op, and this is what I get?

36:46.204 --> 36:48.249
Huh? Come on,
you're killing me.

36:48.293 --> 36:50.077
I appreciate you, uh,

36:50.120 --> 36:52.471
dusting off
your wet suit for me.

36:52.514 --> 36:54.516
I know I said
that you should start

36:54.560 --> 36:56.126
letting Bravo
stand on their own,

36:56.170 --> 36:59.042
but in my darkest moments,

36:59.086 --> 37:01.306
I was really hoping you'd choose

37:01.349 --> 37:03.221
to get back into the fight,
brother.

37:04.265 --> 37:06.224
Wasn't any choice to be made.

37:10.837 --> 37:12.795
So, uh,

37:12.839 --> 37:15.537
is Bravo 1
back in the saddle for good?

37:15.581 --> 37:17.104
No, man.

37:17.147 --> 37:19.280
This was my last dance.

37:19.324 --> 37:20.803
Then you went out in style.

37:22.152 --> 37:23.806
Just another op.

37:25.852 --> 37:28.855
Oh, yeah, right.

37:35.209 --> 37:37.951
All right, make sure
that's taped down good.

37:39.996 --> 37:41.998
Go ahead, cut him loose.

37:43.304 --> 37:45.654
Coming through, guys.

37:52.487 --> 37:54.446
Bye-bye.

38:15.162 --> 38:15.902
Daddy!

38:15.945 --> 38:17.251
Hey.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.340
Hey, honey. Hey, baby.

38:19.384 --> 38:21.168
Hey. Oh. Okay, stop, stop, stop.

38:22.212 --> 38:24.954
Oh, God. Naima.

38:24.998 --> 38:26.129
Naima.

38:26.173 --> 38:27.914
I'm home.

38:27.957 --> 38:29.742
Daddy's home.

38:29.785 --> 38:31.352
Come here, buddy.

38:31.396 --> 38:33.267
Hey. Hey.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.921
You miss Daddy?

38:34.964 --> 38:36.749
You give me a smile?

38:36.792 --> 38:40.187
Hey. I missed you so much.

38:42.363 --> 38:44.278
I missed you a lot.

38:58.248 --> 39:00.163
Thank you.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.934
DAVIS:Too many close calls
on this one.

39:31.978 --> 39:33.327
What if we didn't get him back?

39:33.371 --> 39:35.503
It ain't like you to be
dealing in hypotheticals.

39:35.547 --> 39:40.247
Yeah, but this Ray ordeal's
a good reminder

39:40.290 --> 39:43.511
that tomorrow isn't promised
to any of us.

39:43.555 --> 39:46.949
Kind of makes you, uh,
reconsider things

39:46.993 --> 39:48.342
that, you know,
you've been putting off.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.518
I mean, I would offer

39:50.562 --> 39:51.867
to buy you a drink,

39:51.911 --> 39:53.478
but I do remember
last time I did,

39:53.521 --> 39:55.349
you were like, "I can
buy my own drinks."

39:55.393 --> 39:56.959
And you walked away.Oh.

39:57.003 --> 39:59.440
Yeah...I'll have a whiskey.

39:59.484 --> 40:01.137
Oh. Oh, really?Yeah. Yeah.

40:01.181 --> 40:03.401
Like you said,
you know, it just...

40:03.444 --> 40:05.185
makes you reconsider things.

40:05.228 --> 40:07.361
Okay.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.977
I'll get, uh,
two shots of whiskey.

40:15.021 --> 40:16.979
Hey, what's up, peaches?

40:17.023 --> 40:19.721
Where the hell'd you go to
when we got back?

40:19.765 --> 40:21.506
Had to go see Lindell.Oh, yeah?

40:21.549 --> 40:23.769
Does he, uh, get you
to push papers again?

40:23.812 --> 40:25.466
He reinstated me.

40:25.510 --> 40:26.989
Bravo.

40:27.033 --> 40:28.338
No way.Oh, yeah.

40:28.382 --> 40:30.297
Yeah! You're back
to Bravo, baby.

40:30.340 --> 40:32.212
[grunts]Yeah! Hell yeah, brother.

40:32.255 --> 40:34.257
I guess, uh, saving Ray

40:34.301 --> 40:36.999
and sparing Lindell from a
congressional rectal exam

40:37.043 --> 40:39.654
changed his mind.

40:39.698 --> 40:42.178
Actually, it was Jason.

40:42.222 --> 40:44.354
Wow. So, Bravo 1's back, too?

40:44.398 --> 40:45.443
No.

40:45.486 --> 40:47.923
He just came back to get Ray.Well,

40:47.967 --> 40:49.403
I'm happy for you, buddy.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.449
Yeah? Got everything you want
right in front of you.

40:53.233 --> 40:54.756
Ow!

40:54.800 --> 40:56.584
All right.
