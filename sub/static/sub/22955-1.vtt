01:21.173 --> 01:23.008
Police. Fuck off.

01:23.108 --> 01:24.644
Fuck off.

01:40.259 --> 01:42.061
Huh?

01:42.161 --> 01:43.963
How did he get away?

01:55.007 --> 01:57.409
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

02:00.279 --> 02:01.881
Yeah, it's me.
We have a problem.

02:01.981 --> 02:05.117
Something went wrong
with the deal. Yeah.

02:05.217 --> 02:06.452
Baldwin's gone.

02:06.552 --> 02:08.387
We moved in as fast as we could.

02:08.488 --> 02:10.622
The whole place is
fucking crawling with police.

02:10.723 --> 02:13.659
Wait. Listen, listen,
he's not going anywhere.

02:13.759 --> 02:15.561
'Cause I've got his visas
right here, yeah.

02:15.661 --> 02:17.129
He didn't get them.

02:17.229 --> 02:19.264
He can't get to their world.

02:19.364 --> 02:21.400
No, there was a hooker
in the bathroom.

02:21.501 --> 02:23.068
She might have seen something.

02:23.168 --> 02:24.303
Yeah.

02:24.403 --> 02:26.105
Bring her to you.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.331
Why do you punish yourself?

04:32.431 --> 04:34.566
Come on, now.

04:34.667 --> 04:37.502
Even a game lost
is a game well played.

04:37.603 --> 04:40.372
Spoken like a man
who is about to lose.

04:40.472 --> 04:42.441
I'm trying to teach you.

04:42.541 --> 04:44.543
There's your problem.
You're too nice.

04:44.644 --> 04:47.212
And this always ends the same.

04:53.653 --> 04:55.287
Oh, well.

04:55.387 --> 04:57.222
Next time.

05:00.359 --> 05:03.028
Sometimes I get the feeling
you let me win these games.

05:03.128 --> 05:06.699
Where would be the lesson
in that?

07:42.788 --> 07:45.057
"I took the long way
to work today."

07:59.304 --> 08:01.440
"The weather was too hot
for riding."

08:04.776 --> 08:07.046
"It never cools off
at this time of year."

08:07.146 --> 08:10.816
"My mother loves the winter,
but she lives in the south."

08:10.916 --> 08:12.784
"Mine is partial to spring."

08:12.885 --> 08:14.619
"Flowers in the air."

08:14.719 --> 08:15.855
"Orchids."

08:15.955 --> 08:18.858
"Always a good season
for orchids."

08:33.538 --> 08:35.474
Y-You have...

08:57.429 --> 08:59.731
The girls are saying
you've got a meeting upstairs.

08:59.831 --> 09:01.633
You should stop charming
those women.

09:01.733 --> 09:04.136
Is it the Strategy job?

09:06.605 --> 09:07.973
Howard. Mon frÃ¨re.

09:08.073 --> 09:11.576
Honestly? I do not think
you should waste your time.

09:11.676 --> 09:13.445
- Oh, you don't?
- No.

09:13.545 --> 09:15.580
Just let it go.
Pretend it never happened.

09:17.616 --> 09:20.052
I think you're just afraid
you're gonna miss me.

09:34.799 --> 09:36.635
This way, please.

09:41.573 --> 09:43.108
Wait, please. In the circle.

09:54.920 --> 09:56.555
This way.

10:19.911 --> 10:21.380
Oh. Hello.

10:21.480 --> 10:22.847
They brought this in.

10:22.948 --> 10:25.350
I'd share it, but...

10:27.719 --> 10:28.988
Oh, what's that, your rÃ©sumÃ©?

10:29.088 --> 10:32.324
No, we have it on the, um,
on the computer.

10:32.424 --> 10:33.725
Yeah. Howard...

10:33.825 --> 10:36.528
Silk.

10:36.628 --> 10:38.163
Howard Silk.

10:38.263 --> 10:39.965
Been in the Office 29 years.

10:40.065 --> 10:42.601
Worked your way up to Interface.

10:42.701 --> 10:45.304
As you can see, I've made
Row Designation six years now.

10:45.404 --> 10:46.905
Oh, sorry to hear about
your wife, by the way.

10:47.006 --> 10:48.073
How-how is she?

10:48.173 --> 10:51.710
Uh, sh-she's improving.

10:51.810 --> 10:53.145
- Yeah?
- Thank you. Yeah.

10:53.245 --> 10:55.147
Her coworkers
speak very highly of her.

10:55.247 --> 10:57.216
I've never met her myself,
but, uh...

11:00.252 --> 11:01.920
At my last review, uh,

11:02.021 --> 11:03.822
they mentioned there was
an opening in Strategy.

11:03.922 --> 11:05.757
- Sorry, where do you live?
- Sorry, what?

11:05.857 --> 11:07.826
- Where do you live?
- I'm sor...

11:07.926 --> 11:09.995
- Uh, Veilsdorf.
- Do you like it there?

11:10.095 --> 11:13.232
- It's quiet.
- Drives me mad.

11:13.332 --> 11:15.967
I went out with a girl from
there once... not very long.

11:16.068 --> 11:17.136
I mean,
you have to get into a cab

11:17.236 --> 11:18.337
to find a decent meal,
don't you?

11:21.806 --> 11:23.608
As-as you can see, I, uh...

11:23.708 --> 11:26.011
I've been with Interface
for quite some time now.

11:26.111 --> 11:27.879
Mm. No, yeah, one of our best.

11:27.979 --> 11:29.814
No one has ever
had a complaint about you.

11:29.914 --> 11:32.284
Excellent. Uh...

11:32.384 --> 11:35.154
I was hoping there would be
room for me in Strategy.

11:35.254 --> 11:38.590
An opportunity to serve
at a higher level.

11:38.690 --> 11:40.259
More relevant.

11:40.359 --> 11:43.262
I'm sorry, Howard,
but that post has been filled.

11:45.797 --> 11:47.566
When?

11:47.666 --> 11:50.001
Howard, you're an Interface man.
Everyone likes you there.

11:50.102 --> 11:52.371
There's no need to
upset the cart, is there?

11:54.406 --> 11:56.841
I-If... if I could
just have an interview...

11:56.941 --> 11:59.978
You know, Oversight were looking
at your tapes from this morning.

12:00.079 --> 12:01.913
Apparently, there was
a non-approved exchange.

12:02.013 --> 12:03.182
Uh, I'm sorry.

12:03.282 --> 12:05.550
- Uh, uh, "non-approved"?
- Hmm.

12:05.650 --> 12:09.288
Man of your experience,
you'd think you'd know better.

12:11.156 --> 12:13.058
The man had a...

12:13.158 --> 12:15.494
a spot on his...

12:15.594 --> 12:18.797
With all due respect,
Mr. Quayle...

12:18.897 --> 12:22.801
I have come to this building
every day and done my job.

12:22.901 --> 12:25.570
I understand secrecy, security.

12:25.670 --> 12:29.274
Three decades
I've given to this office.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.110
But, honestly,
sometimes it scares me.

12:31.210 --> 12:33.178
I don't know what we do here.

12:33.278 --> 12:34.846
I certainly don't understand

12:34.946 --> 12:37.816
why telling a stranger
that he has a spot on his tie

12:37.916 --> 12:40.752
makes one shred of difference.

12:43.188 --> 12:45.157
Howard, it's been 30 years.

12:45.257 --> 12:49.161
If it was gonna happen,
it would have happened.

12:53.798 --> 12:55.667
Yeah.

12:58.870 --> 13:00.839
Howard.

13:00.939 --> 13:02.841
We're celebrating. Drinks?

13:02.941 --> 13:04.876
What's the occasion?

13:04.976 --> 13:06.311
Eh, Marcel, the bastard.

13:06.411 --> 13:09.181
He got himself
that Strategy job.

13:11.049 --> 13:12.717
Why don't you come?

13:14.186 --> 13:15.920
Uh, uh, no, I can't.

13:16.020 --> 13:19.724
Um... plans.

13:19.824 --> 13:21.526
Congratulations.

13:33.538 --> 13:35.474
Yeah, okay.

14:10.242 --> 14:11.943
I've been trying you all week.

14:12.043 --> 14:15.214
Should have occurred to me
I could've just found you here.

14:15.314 --> 14:18.283
Yes, it should have.

14:20.018 --> 14:21.853
My mother's
always been difficult.

14:21.953 --> 14:24.256
It's no secret.

14:24.356 --> 14:27.892
But I'm the one
who still has to live with her.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.861
She wants what she wants.

14:32.364 --> 14:36.134
You came all the way here
just to tell me that?

14:36.235 --> 14:38.102
There's been no improvement.

14:38.203 --> 14:40.239
Yes. Concussive trauma
can take up to a year...

14:40.339 --> 14:41.873
I know, Howard.
I've spoken to them, too.

14:41.973 --> 14:45.377
But we have to be realistic.
It's been six weeks.

14:45.477 --> 14:48.247
They're moving her
to long-term care.

14:48.347 --> 14:53.151
All our mother wants
is to have her at home...

14:53.252 --> 14:55.587
if the time comes.

14:58.156 --> 15:00.392
Have a look at this.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.363
Sign it when
you've had a moment.

15:06.431 --> 15:08.933
She wants her
surrounded by family.

15:09.033 --> 15:11.503
I'm her family.

15:13.104 --> 15:16.207
I tell you what,
I'll pop it over here.

15:18.510 --> 15:21.246
Please think it over.

15:40.164 --> 15:42.267
I have a new book.

15:46.638 --> 15:49.908
"You, only.

15:50.008 --> 15:53.478
Only you... exist."

17:10.154 --> 17:11.990
You know who I am?

17:12.089 --> 17:13.425
Yes.

17:14.893 --> 17:16.928
Aldrich. Housekeeping.

17:17.028 --> 17:19.397
Do you know why
we might want to speak?

17:19.498 --> 17:21.965
I told you,
he doesn't know a damn thing.

17:22.066 --> 17:23.201
He's nobody.

17:23.300 --> 17:24.636
Go and get him.

17:33.011 --> 17:36.047
Sorry. It's his job
to be disliked.

17:36.147 --> 17:38.983
I... Have I done
something wrong?

17:39.083 --> 17:41.586
Listen, Howard,
we have a bit of a situation.

17:41.686 --> 17:44.623
Um, something we need
to bring you in on.

17:44.723 --> 17:47.358
Me?

17:47.459 --> 17:49.828
Someone's walked in
from the other side.

17:49.928 --> 17:51.430
It might be a defection.

17:51.530 --> 17:53.398
Don't really know
what else to call it.

17:53.498 --> 17:55.133
I'm-I'm sorry,
the other side? I...

17:55.233 --> 17:58.169
Well, typically we don't
entertain this sort of business.

17:58.269 --> 18:00.138
Strangers come over,
we turn them away.

18:00.238 --> 18:02.874
But this one is... different.

18:02.974 --> 18:04.643
He... he's valuable.

18:04.743 --> 18:06.578
And...

18:06.678 --> 18:08.813
Well, he's only willing
to speak to you.

18:25.497 --> 18:28.366
Just, whatever you do...

18:28.467 --> 18:30.134
don't panic.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.637
This is a bad idea.

18:34.939 --> 18:36.708
Wha... What...

18:36.808 --> 18:39.110
Hi, Howard.

18:42.313 --> 18:43.715
Well, this is disappointing.

18:43.815 --> 18:47.418
Why did you come over, Howard?

18:47.519 --> 18:49.554
I'm Howard.

18:49.654 --> 18:52.223
Does he really not know
what's going on?

18:52.323 --> 18:54.759
What level are you?

18:54.859 --> 18:57.662
- He's an Interface man.
- Enough.

18:57.762 --> 19:00.064
- He's wasting our time.
- Believe me, I'm not.

19:00.164 --> 19:02.567
But I have to be back
in about 12 minutes,

19:02.667 --> 19:04.703
so let's discuss terms.

19:04.803 --> 19:08.106
First, no one outside this room
knows about this arrangement.

19:08.206 --> 19:10.509
Why would we listen
to a word you have to say?

19:10.609 --> 19:12.644
Because if you don't,
people start dying.

19:12.744 --> 19:14.646
A kill order came out
from my side,

19:14.746 --> 19:16.515
targeting people on your side.

19:16.615 --> 19:18.049
- Bullshit.
- Yeah, I get it.

19:18.149 --> 19:20.451
You're skeptical.
You've made that very clear.

19:20.552 --> 19:22.453
If there is a problem,
we go to the Fourth Floor.

19:22.554 --> 19:24.489
Your Fourth Floor
may be compromised.

19:24.589 --> 19:25.824
He's lying.

19:25.924 --> 19:28.627
There's no intelligence
to confirm any of this.

19:28.727 --> 19:30.394
All due respect,
your intelligence

19:30.495 --> 19:32.463
is kind of a shit show
right now.

19:33.498 --> 19:34.899
Okay, well, this was fun.

19:34.999 --> 19:36.400
Got to go.

19:36.501 --> 19:39.270
Wait.

19:39.370 --> 19:41.239
Who's on the list?

19:41.339 --> 19:43.107
Not till I know where you stand.

19:43.207 --> 19:46.410
I'll be back tomorrow.
Longer visa. "Courier duty."

19:46.511 --> 19:48.580
You have until then
to make up your mind.

19:48.680 --> 19:51.616
And we're gonna need this one,
so you might want to...

19:51.716 --> 19:53.918
I don't know, read him in.

19:56.287 --> 19:57.789
Wow. Interface.

19:57.889 --> 19:59.858
Perfect.

20:13.672 --> 20:14.906
- What is this?!
- Oh, shut up, Howard.

20:15.006 --> 20:16.875
J-Just let me think
for a second, okay?

20:18.643 --> 20:20.511
He looks exactly like me.

20:20.612 --> 20:22.881
He is you, Howard.

20:22.981 --> 20:25.516
Really, do you have any idea
how lucky you are?

20:25.617 --> 20:27.719
No one... no one...
Gets to meet their other.

20:27.819 --> 20:29.854
Other? -Everyone
wonders about it, but...

20:29.954 --> 20:32.290
Mr. Quayle, you brought me
into that room.

20:32.390 --> 20:34.392
Please tell me what is going on.

20:41.532 --> 20:43.802
30 years ago,
during the Cold War,

20:43.902 --> 20:46.671
there was an experiment,
an accident, in this building.

20:46.771 --> 20:48.673
Eastern scientists...

20:48.773 --> 20:50.575
Something went wrong.

20:50.675 --> 20:54.345
They opened up a passage
directly beneath us.

20:54.445 --> 20:56.881
When you go through this door,
you come out the other side,

20:56.981 --> 20:59.417
you're in another world,
identical to ours.

20:59.517 --> 21:01.319
I... Identical to ours?

21:01.419 --> 21:03.187
Same events, same experiences.

21:03.287 --> 21:05.356
So, where this building stands,
where we are now,

21:05.456 --> 21:07.425
- this is called the Crossing.
- Wh...

21:07.525 --> 21:09.493
But... Identical to ours?

21:09.594 --> 21:11.830
He-he... he looks
exactly like me,

21:11.930 --> 21:13.965
but he is nothing like me.

21:14.065 --> 21:17.836
So, when this door opened,
our paths began to branch off.

21:17.936 --> 21:19.804
More and more, over time.

21:19.904 --> 21:22.774
This... this is not my job
to tell you this, Howard.

21:22.874 --> 21:25.576
You shouldn't even...

21:25.677 --> 21:30.514
What you need to know is
we keep a lid on it.

21:30.615 --> 21:32.851
We trade information,
we gather intelligence

21:32.951 --> 21:34.786
- from the other side.
- What-what kind of intelligence?

21:34.886 --> 21:37.288
That's not important.
To you.

21:38.957 --> 21:41.893
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

21:41.993 --> 21:44.495
Okay, who else knows about this?

21:44.595 --> 21:46.564
Out... Outside this building?

21:46.665 --> 21:47.966
What do you think?

21:48.066 --> 21:51.836
I-I don't know...
Governments, world leaders?

21:51.936 --> 21:55.373
Some. That's... It's murky.
I don't...

21:55.473 --> 21:56.775
Look, Howard,
you know this now.

21:56.875 --> 21:59.443
But you do not know this.

21:59.543 --> 22:01.646
Is he gone?

22:01.746 --> 22:04.382
- Yes. He gave me a name.
- From the kill list?

22:04.482 --> 22:06.785
Emily Silk, his wife.

22:06.885 --> 22:09.988
- Wh-What about my wife?
- She's in the hospital.

22:10.088 --> 22:11.790
- Albert Schweitzer.
- Okay, we'll put a watch on her,

22:11.890 --> 22:13.958
- as a precaution.
- Hold... What, are you saying

22:14.058 --> 22:16.427
- my wife is in danger?
- No, no, she's fine.

22:16.527 --> 22:17.862
Howard, you know what?
Go back to work.

22:17.962 --> 22:20.765
Wh-What does my wife
have to do with any of this?

22:20.865 --> 22:23.401
We'll handle it.
She'll be safe.

22:23.501 --> 22:25.737
We'll be in touch.

22:25.837 --> 22:27.906
What did he say?

22:28.006 --> 22:30.675
We have to be very cautious
about it.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.442
Gin and tonic, bitte.

24:29.660 --> 24:32.063
Hey. Hey.

24:32.163 --> 24:34.198
- Marcel.
- Ja?

24:48.412 --> 24:51.282
Very quiet this morning.

24:53.317 --> 24:55.553
Do you think...

24:55.653 --> 24:59.223
life is just
a sum of our choices?

25:00.724 --> 25:03.594
You do something and I react.

25:03.694 --> 25:06.931
You do it often enough...

25:07.031 --> 25:09.700
my reaction changes.

25:09.800 --> 25:13.171
We're changing, all the time.

25:14.939 --> 25:17.541
Those choices define who we are.

25:17.641 --> 25:19.643
No.

25:19.743 --> 25:21.812
Who we are is not about choice.

25:23.681 --> 25:25.616
It's not?

25:25.716 --> 25:29.120
You are who you are.
I am what I am.

25:29.220 --> 25:32.223
And the game only ends one way.

25:35.026 --> 25:37.295
Know your problem?

25:39.397 --> 25:41.332
You're too young.

26:18.102 --> 26:19.737
Purpose of visit?

26:19.837 --> 26:21.839
Bringing the embassy pouch.

26:21.940 --> 26:23.641
12-hour visa.

26:25.910 --> 26:28.012
It's better on my side.

26:40.158 --> 26:42.160
One of ours was killed
last night.

26:42.260 --> 26:44.362
Not here.

27:00.311 --> 27:02.813
You know who carried this out?

27:02.913 --> 27:04.748
Don't know much about her.

27:04.848 --> 27:06.384
Her?

27:06.484 --> 27:08.719
Yeah, we didn't know that
until the other night.

27:08.819 --> 27:12.790
She skipped out on a crash
meeting by posing as a hooker.

27:12.890 --> 27:14.892
Handle is Baldwin.

27:14.993 --> 27:18.296
She's a contract assassin.

27:18.396 --> 27:22.100
Killed some good men
on my side.

27:22.200 --> 27:24.035
That your dead man's dossier?

27:29.040 --> 27:31.109
Marcel.

27:31.209 --> 27:33.411
Double tap entry.

27:33.511 --> 27:35.346
No witnesses.

27:35.446 --> 27:37.215
Marcel was killed?

27:37.315 --> 27:40.718
Howard, you wouldn't happen
to have any cream, would you?

27:46.957 --> 27:48.993
So why did they target this man?

27:49.093 --> 27:50.528
I don't know.

27:50.628 --> 27:51.962
He was Strategy?

27:52.063 --> 27:53.497
He was just promoted.

27:53.597 --> 27:55.199
Hmm.

27:55.299 --> 27:57.068
Look, I'm sorry.
We've done our part, all right?

27:57.168 --> 27:58.636
We... we keep doing
everything you've asked for.

27:58.736 --> 28:00.838
It's time for you
to be a little more forthright.

28:00.938 --> 28:02.073
What is this about?

28:02.173 --> 28:04.875
There's been some infighting
in leadership on my side.

28:04.975 --> 28:06.177
You've been aware of it?

28:06.277 --> 28:08.012
We heard a few things.

28:08.112 --> 28:11.115
There's a faction,
may be trying a takeover.

28:11.215 --> 28:13.384
Unclear who, exactly.

28:13.484 --> 28:17.055
They're hard-line, ideological,
don't care much for diplomacy.

28:17.155 --> 28:18.822
What do they want?

28:18.922 --> 28:21.925
It's been bad on my side
for months now.

28:22.026 --> 28:23.894
Contentious, defection talk.

28:23.994 --> 28:25.796
People have been disappearing.

28:25.896 --> 28:28.066
- And now the fight spills over.
- So what is this?

28:28.166 --> 28:29.767
They're just picking off
our people at random?

28:29.867 --> 28:31.102
It's not random.

28:31.202 --> 28:33.737
I don't know what it is,
but it's not random.

28:33.837 --> 28:36.407
Ah, enough. We have to
tell the Fourth Floor. -No.

28:36.507 --> 28:40.044
Right now, nobody knows
about this arrangement.

28:40.144 --> 28:41.979
We need to keep it that way.

28:42.080 --> 28:45.015
I... I'm-I'm sorry
to interrupt, but I...

28:45.116 --> 28:46.250
I don't understand.

28:46.350 --> 28:48.086
Why do they want to hurt Emily?

28:48.186 --> 28:50.921
My guess is
to send me a message.

28:51.021 --> 28:52.156
By threatening my wife?

28:52.256 --> 28:54.392
Wh-Why not yours?

28:54.492 --> 28:56.160
My Emily's dead.

28:57.961 --> 29:00.298
Cancer.

29:06.904 --> 29:08.839
What's your designation?

29:08.939 --> 29:12.976
Officially, I'm 4C, Diplomacy.

29:13.077 --> 29:14.845
But I'm Section Two.

29:14.945 --> 29:17.215
I've spent my career building

29:17.315 --> 29:20.084
our clandestine operational
network on your side.

29:21.952 --> 29:24.222
So Section Two is real.

29:24.322 --> 29:28.192
What about, uh, the other Emily?

29:28.292 --> 29:29.793
Where is she, at work?

29:29.893 --> 29:32.930
No.

29:33.030 --> 29:34.998
Um...

29:35.099 --> 29:38.102
six weeks ago,
she was crossing the street,

29:38.202 --> 29:42.373
and a...
a car came out of nowhere.

29:44.308 --> 29:46.610
Kid driving,
wasn't paying attention.

29:49.079 --> 29:51.182
She's in a coma.

29:54.352 --> 29:56.354
So she's in a hospital?

29:56.454 --> 29:59.323
Yeah. -All right.
I need to know everything.

29:59.423 --> 30:02.260
If Baldwin is operating
on this side,

30:02.360 --> 30:04.228
your wife may be
her next target.

30:04.328 --> 30:05.929
We have guards.

30:06.029 --> 30:08.132
- Hold 'em back.
- Hold them back?

30:08.232 --> 30:10.634
Look, the only advantage
we have right now is

30:10.734 --> 30:12.570
she doesn't know I'm here.

30:12.670 --> 30:15.005
She's methodical,
she studies routine.

30:15.105 --> 30:18.409
One break in that,
and she might call it off.

30:18.509 --> 30:21.111
- When do you visit?
- Every night.

30:21.212 --> 30:23.481
All right, I'll go
in your place tonight.

30:23.581 --> 30:26.284
Howard, why do you think
I brought you in on this?

30:26.384 --> 30:27.918
For your great tactical skill?

30:28.018 --> 30:30.354
Your in-depth knowledge
of this whole fucking thing?

30:30.454 --> 30:34.158
I need to pretend to be you,
take Baldwin out myself.

30:34.258 --> 30:36.227
You don't make these decisions.

30:36.327 --> 30:38.329
Yeah, you're right. I don't.

30:38.429 --> 30:40.898
He does.

30:40.998 --> 30:42.300
Fine.

30:42.400 --> 30:45.002
We'll arrange things on our end.

30:45.102 --> 30:46.737
We'll be ready in...

30:48.839 --> 30:50.641
What-what do you think?

30:52.776 --> 30:54.712
We start immediately.

30:54.812 --> 30:56.314
Excellent.

30:56.414 --> 31:00.150
You two stay here until then.

31:02.052 --> 31:03.687
Get acquainted.

31:16.667 --> 31:19.703
If he makes one left
instead of a right, kill him.

31:49.833 --> 31:51.735
Like looking in a mirror?

31:53.904 --> 31:56.206
This was my favorite tie.

31:56.307 --> 31:57.641
I lost it years ago.

31:57.741 --> 31:59.176
Keep it.

31:59.277 --> 32:01.745
I-I haven't worn it in years.

32:01.845 --> 32:05.283
Okay, let's talk routine.

32:05.383 --> 32:08.085
You go in,
straight up to her room.

32:08.185 --> 32:11.355
Anyone you interact with
regularly?

32:11.455 --> 32:13.190
Uh... the nurses.

32:13.291 --> 32:15.359
I say hello.

32:15.459 --> 32:17.127
No one else, really.

32:17.227 --> 32:18.862
Here, I-I want you to try this.

32:18.962 --> 32:21.198
It's from the bakery downstairs.

32:21.299 --> 32:23.200
No, thanks.

32:23.301 --> 32:25.369
Please, indulge me. It's a...

32:25.469 --> 32:27.805
I spent a summer in Maine
when I was a kid.

32:27.905 --> 32:29.273
Yeah, I was there.

32:29.373 --> 32:32.042
Yes, of course.
I'm sorry.

32:32.142 --> 32:35.112
Right. We spent.

32:35.212 --> 32:38.181
Remember Dad got the...
the funnel cakes?

32:38.282 --> 32:41.018
Yeah. I really can't.
High cholesterol.

32:41.118 --> 32:42.320
Really?

32:42.420 --> 32:44.788
Yeah. You don't have it?

32:44.888 --> 32:47.024
I-I don't think so.

32:47.124 --> 32:49.293
Okay.

32:58.402 --> 33:01.038
There's so many things
I want to ask you about.

33:01.138 --> 33:04.875
Memories and... feelings
that I've had my whole life

33:04.975 --> 33:06.410
that only belonged to me.

33:06.510 --> 33:10.814
And now it's... us.

33:10.914 --> 33:13.851
We share... genetics.

33:13.951 --> 33:16.320
A childhood.

33:18.722 --> 33:20.391
So?

33:20.491 --> 33:22.526
So how did we get to be
so different?

33:22.626 --> 33:26.229
You'd drive yourself crazy
trying to chart it out.

33:26.330 --> 33:28.298
Seriously, people have.

33:30.267 --> 33:32.169
What kind of music
do you listen to?

33:32.269 --> 33:33.404
I don't care for it.

33:33.504 --> 33:35.939
Favorite food?

33:36.039 --> 33:37.441
Taste buds must be the same.

33:37.541 --> 33:39.209
I don't know.
American, I guess.

33:39.309 --> 33:41.879
Chinese.

33:41.979 --> 33:43.747
It's fascinating.

33:43.847 --> 33:47.250
Tell you what
I've been wondering.

33:47.351 --> 33:50.354
How come you never
got out of Interface?

33:50.454 --> 33:52.790
All these years,
you never moved up.

33:52.890 --> 33:54.157
What held you back?

33:54.257 --> 33:55.926
I don't know.

33:57.761 --> 34:00.230
- Just, uh, life, I guess.
- Seriously?

34:00.330 --> 34:02.400
- Life? That's your excuse?
- Well...

34:02.500 --> 34:05.302
I mean, I'm not,
I'm not making excuses.

34:05.403 --> 34:07.170
You have regrets?

34:07.270 --> 34:08.539
Yeah, some.

34:08.639 --> 34:10.541
See, this is what's
so fucked up.

34:10.641 --> 34:14.777
Genetics, childhood...
Doesn't matter.

34:14.878 --> 34:18.716
We're helpless
to our experience.

34:18.815 --> 34:22.585
Difference between you
and me could be a single moment,

34:22.686 --> 34:24.855
one little thing gone wrong.

34:24.955 --> 34:26.824
Or right.

34:29.893 --> 34:31.795
Okay, routine.

34:31.895 --> 34:33.897
At the hospital.

34:33.996 --> 34:36.500
Um...

34:36.600 --> 34:39.202
I, uh, I read to her.

34:39.302 --> 34:40.538
Books she likes.

34:40.638 --> 34:42.973
Um, you know, poetry, mostly.

34:43.072 --> 34:46.309
Whitman, Rilke, you know.

34:46.409 --> 34:47.878
Stay in touch
with any of her family?

34:47.978 --> 34:51.549
- Just Eric.
- That piece of shit.

34:53.617 --> 34:56.319
- Eric always had it out for us.
- Yeah.

34:56.420 --> 34:58.822
Tried to talk her
out of the wedding?

35:00.891 --> 35:02.025
Wedding?

35:02.125 --> 35:05.763
Yeah, the... wedding.

35:08.532 --> 35:10.968
28 years ago, October.

35:11.068 --> 35:12.670
We eloped.

35:12.770 --> 35:15.305
28 years?

35:15.405 --> 35:17.875
Wasn't that
right after we'd met?

35:17.975 --> 35:19.877
When you know, you know.

35:25.783 --> 35:29.887
Our first date, when she, uh,
left the table to wash up,

35:29.987 --> 35:33.857
I said to the waiter,
"I'm gonna marry her."

35:33.957 --> 35:35.559
I just knew.

35:39.597 --> 35:43.000
I... I couldn't get
to sleep last night.

35:43.100 --> 35:45.035
I was...

35:45.135 --> 35:46.770
I was so excited.

35:46.870 --> 35:50.508
I... I was thinking,
if there's another me,

35:50.608 --> 35:54.244
that means there's another her.

35:54.344 --> 35:55.879
But...

35:55.979 --> 35:58.448
She gonna make it?

35:58.549 --> 36:01.652
It's too early to tell.

36:04.555 --> 36:06.590
Were you, um...

36:06.690 --> 36:11.495
Were you there...
for her at the end?

36:11.595 --> 36:13.964
Uh, I, um...

36:16.033 --> 36:17.467
I wasn't perfect.

36:17.568 --> 36:20.871
You have regrets.

36:39.456 --> 36:41.358
Which one are you?

36:41.458 --> 36:44.061
- Fuck off.
- It's time.

37:00.077 --> 37:02.479
Oh, wait. Uh, can you
pull over right here?

37:02.580 --> 37:05.549
What is it?

37:08.485 --> 37:11.589
I'll be right back.

37:28.806 --> 37:32.009
Here. I always
bring her flowers.

37:43.587 --> 37:45.155
Radio.

37:47.324 --> 37:49.159
Give him one, too.

38:07.077 --> 38:09.713
Uh, we got two men
on every exit.

38:09.813 --> 38:11.548
He told you everything?

38:11.649 --> 38:14.517
Yeah, take a right
off the elevator, room 322.

38:14.618 --> 38:16.687
Flowers.

38:16.787 --> 38:19.189
Give me a gun.

38:21.692 --> 38:23.260
Our guard is never down.

38:25.528 --> 38:27.064
All right.

38:32.135 --> 38:35.072
Keep your people
out of sight, huh?

38:36.807 --> 38:38.608
Howard, wait.

38:38.709 --> 38:40.110
Um... the, uh...

38:40.210 --> 38:43.881
the nurse on duty tonight
is named Talia.

38:46.817 --> 38:48.686
Keep him out of sight, too, huh?

38:48.786 --> 38:50.287
Pull around back.

40:24.147 --> 40:26.817
What did you talk about,
the two of you,

40:26.917 --> 40:28.318
in your apartment?

40:30.120 --> 40:31.922
Cholesterol.

40:35.092 --> 40:36.827
10:00.

40:39.997 --> 40:41.731
There's a visitor.

40:41.832 --> 40:43.867
- Is it her?
- No.

40:43.967 --> 40:46.103
Male. 40s, well dressed.

40:47.704 --> 40:49.006
Uh, that could be Eric.

40:49.106 --> 40:51.408
- Who the fuck is Eric?
- Her brother.

40:53.743 --> 40:55.979
Okay. What do I need to know?

40:56.079 --> 40:58.348
He left a contract on the,
on the table by the door.

41:01.218 --> 41:03.220
What is this?

41:03.320 --> 41:04.822
You didn't sign it.

41:04.922 --> 41:06.790
No. No, of course not.

41:06.890 --> 41:07.891
You weren't going to.

41:07.991 --> 41:09.827
It's... complicated.

41:09.927 --> 41:11.294
Get rid of him.

41:16.900 --> 41:18.969
Well, I'm leaving
for the airport.

41:20.804 --> 41:23.240
So what do I tell her?

41:23.340 --> 41:25.275
Listen.

41:25.375 --> 41:27.978
Their mother wants her
back in England.

41:28.078 --> 41:30.247
Howard, sign the fucking thing,
get him out of there.

41:30.347 --> 41:32.682
It's time to let go, Howard.

41:32.782 --> 41:34.384
Let her be with family.

41:36.486 --> 41:39.289
This is about me, isn't it?

41:39.389 --> 41:40.991
You tried to warn her
away from me

41:41.091 --> 41:42.092
- from the beginning.
- Stop it.

41:42.192 --> 41:43.927
She was in love.

41:44.027 --> 41:45.929
She was happy.

41:46.029 --> 41:49.099
And you tried to ruin
the one good thing she had.

41:49.199 --> 41:50.834
I'm gonna ask you
one more time,

41:50.934 --> 41:52.402
and then I'm gonna leave
'cause this is childish.

41:55.839 --> 41:57.674
She will sue you
until you submit.

41:57.774 --> 41:59.376
You understand that?

42:02.112 --> 42:03.313
Sign it.

42:03.413 --> 42:05.415
Let's be done with this.

42:07.017 --> 42:09.052
Just sign the fucking thing.

42:17.794 --> 42:19.029
No.

42:19.129 --> 42:21.198
- Oh, for fuck sake.
- I'm sorry?

42:24.367 --> 42:25.768
I said no.

42:25.869 --> 42:28.805
Let me tell you something,
Eric.

42:28.906 --> 42:32.775
This is something
very few people will tell you.

42:32.876 --> 42:34.811
You're a real fucking asshole.

42:34.912 --> 42:37.280
Guys like you
confuse words with action.

42:37.380 --> 42:40.483
I don't.

42:40.583 --> 42:43.820
So I will be very, very clear.

42:43.921 --> 42:46.323
If you or anyone in your family

42:46.423 --> 42:49.192
try to take her away from me,
we will be done.

42:49.292 --> 42:51.861
There will be
nothing left to say.

42:51.962 --> 42:54.264
And believe me, Eric,

42:54.364 --> 42:59.236
the last thing you want
is me with nothing left to say.

43:03.873 --> 43:05.508
Incoming female.

43:07.210 --> 43:08.345
Howard, what in God's name...?

43:08.445 --> 43:11.414
- Shh.
- I think it's her.

43:15.852 --> 43:17.487
Go.

43:23.260 --> 43:24.361
Whoa.

43:24.461 --> 43:26.029
Listen to me.

43:26.129 --> 43:27.597
Someone is coming up here
to kill her.

43:27.697 --> 43:29.099
- What?
- Shut the fuck up.

43:29.199 --> 43:31.168
Stay in this room,
stay away from the door.

43:31.268 --> 43:33.236
I'm trying to save your life
here. Do you understand me?

43:33.336 --> 43:35.505
Eric.

43:35.605 --> 43:36.940
Do you understand me?

43:37.040 --> 43:39.109
Yeah. Yes.

43:39.209 --> 43:41.311
Not a fucking sound.

43:59.129 --> 44:00.964
Where is she?

44:01.064 --> 44:03.400
Coming up the elevator now.

45:34.023 --> 45:36.293
What are...?

45:47.137 --> 45:48.605
She's on the second floor!

45:48.705 --> 45:50.340
Second floor!

46:20.603 --> 46:22.439
Outside! Fast!

47:05.848 --> 47:07.384
You okay?

47:11.221 --> 47:12.622
She got away.

47:23.733 --> 47:25.202
Where you going?

47:25.302 --> 47:27.270
To check on my wife.

47:47.957 --> 47:50.327
What the hell is happening?

47:54.497 --> 47:56.766
Just get on the plane, Eric.

47:56.866 --> 47:58.835
It's okay, you can go.

48:01.238 --> 48:03.340
It's safe.

48:44.681 --> 48:46.683
So what happens next?

48:46.783 --> 48:48.084
She'll try again.

48:48.184 --> 48:49.386
And?

48:49.486 --> 48:50.953
I'll get another visa.

48:51.053 --> 48:53.290
Might take 24 hours,
maybe longer.

48:53.390 --> 48:55.592
Meantime, you keep watch.

48:55.692 --> 48:57.827
We're gonna need that one again.

48:59.896 --> 49:01.598
I'll talk to him.

49:29.526 --> 49:31.994
You know, I remember
when I first found out.

49:33.996 --> 49:35.865
It doesn't normally happen
like this, you know.

49:35.965 --> 49:38.100
There's-there's people
you have to talk to.

49:38.200 --> 49:40.570
There's, like, doctors
and psychiatrists.

49:40.670 --> 49:43.440
You're read in.
There's this whole process.

49:43.540 --> 49:45.808
And you, you...

49:45.908 --> 49:47.877
You...

49:53.383 --> 49:54.784
Do you have any idea

49:54.884 --> 49:57.754
the world that's just
opened up to you, Howard?

50:48.605 --> 50:51.073
So we can count on you
to help us?

50:53.910 --> 50:55.311
Thanks for the ride.

50:55.412 --> 50:57.514
Howard. H...

51:00.983 --> 51:01.951
Howard.

51:02.985 --> 51:04.787
Howard!

51:06.423 --> 51:07.957
What do you want?

51:08.057 --> 51:09.892
I'll tell you what I want.

51:09.992 --> 51:13.496
I-I want the promotion that I
should have had three days ago.

51:13.596 --> 51:15.465
Howard, that-that's
not even possible.

51:15.565 --> 51:17.634
And real access.

51:17.734 --> 51:20.437
Real operational knowledge.

51:20.537 --> 51:23.840
I think, after 30 years,
I deserve that.

51:23.940 --> 51:25.542
Okay, Howard, look,
you don't understand.

51:25.642 --> 51:26.909
Uh, it doesn't work like that.

51:29.612 --> 51:31.714
Here's what I do understand.

51:33.583 --> 51:35.618
You need me now.

51:37.954 --> 51:41.691
So, I guess you got to...

51:41.791 --> 51:43.826
I don't know... figure it out.
