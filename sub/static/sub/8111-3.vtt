WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:04.706
TRINA: If you don't know
how to use a computer,
we will teach you here.

00:04.797 --> 00:07.630
Most jobs require at least
basic word processing skills.

00:07.717 --> 00:10.379
We try to get you up to
50 words per minute.

00:10.469 --> 00:14.303
We also have a course
in how to talk to someone
in an interview.

00:14.390 --> 00:16.881
Stuff like what
employers are looking for,

00:16.976 --> 00:18.557
how to turn
negatives into positives.

00:18.644 --> 00:20.760
We can also provide
clothes for the interview
if you need them.

00:20.855 --> 00:23.642
People donate
shoes and suits
all the time.

00:24.275 --> 00:27.517
What if I had
a history with drugs?

00:28.237 --> 00:30.023
That is nothing
to be ashamed of.

00:30.114 --> 00:31.900
Many of our clients
have struggled
with addiction,

00:31.991 --> 00:35.199
and if you want to get clean,
we'll help you do that.

00:35.286 --> 00:36.776
And what if
I have a kid?

00:37.872 --> 00:38.987
No one to help you?

00:39.081 --> 00:43.575
If I need someone to
watch her while I'm in
a class or on an interview,

00:44.253 --> 00:45.789
could you help with that?

00:45.880 --> 00:47.245
We do not provide
child care.

00:47.340 --> 00:49.706
Actually, it's something
that comes up often.

00:49.884 --> 00:51.875
lwould love to
be able to do it.

00:51.969 --> 00:53.925
| just don't
have the resources.

00:54.013 --> 00:56.550
But it's definitely
on the wish list.

00:57.433 --> 01:02.177
Okay.
Okay, uh, thank you.
I'll be back.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.647
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
l have to take this.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.972
Yes, please come back.
We'll get you started.

01:06.317 --> 01:09.229
It was nice to
meet you, Benjamin.

01:09.320 --> 01:10.901
Hey, Oscar.

01:11.781 --> 01:14.318
Ugh! That is too bad.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.364
Did they tell you why?

01:23.668 --> 01:24.828
Yeah.

01:26.170 --> 01:27.205
Mmm-hmm.

01:27.296 --> 01:30.834
Well, look, you know what?
Sometimes you just
don't get the job.

01:30.967 --> 01:33.504
Oscar, I've got to
call you back.

01:35.263 --> 01:36.343
Uh...

01:37.932 --> 01:39.172
Uh, uh...

01:43.354 --> 01:46.096
Benjamin!
Benjamin, wait.

01:51.362 --> 01:53.023
Oh, my God.

02:03.124 --> 02:05.490
Somebody call
an ambulance!

02:19.682 --> 02:20.762
(BUZZING)

02:20.850 --> 02:21.885
(CLICKING)

02:28.065 --> 02:29.271
(BUZZING)

03:08.064 --> 03:10.601
Why am I watching
you cut your hair?

03:10.733 --> 03:14.021
If I do it at home,
I'm the one who
has to clean it up.

03:14.111 --> 03:18.275
l was referring less
to where it's happening
and more to why.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.277
New life, new look.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.944
Does that mean you
like your new life?

03:25.081 --> 03:27.037
If you're asking
if yourjob is safe,

03:27.124 --> 03:30.116
that depends on
what you have to say about
the file you're holding.

03:30.252 --> 03:32.629
It doesn't seem
like much of a case.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.544
Although,
I'm sure I'm wrong.

03:34.632 --> 03:36.623
You are.
Tell me why.

03:36.759 --> 03:39.216
Guy collapsed after
being on his feet
for hours

03:39.303 --> 03:42.795
on a hot day
without breakfast,
so that's really weird.

03:42.890 --> 03:47.475
ER found nothing wrong,
then I decided
I should test his wallet.

03:47.603 --> 03:49.639
He's rich? That's why
we're taking the case?

03:49.730 --> 03:51.015
No, we're taking
the case because

03:51.107 --> 03:53.143
no one knows
what's wrong with him.

03:53.234 --> 03:54.815
And he's rich.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.489
Dr. Adams.

04:00.157 --> 04:01.567
Give her the file.

04:01.659 --> 04:03.240
This is my only copy.

04:04.620 --> 04:07.327
My MO depends upon
the use of a team.

04:07.415 --> 04:10.578
Definitionally,
that involves more
than one person,

04:10.668 --> 04:11.999
so I really have
no choice.

04:12.086 --> 04:14.168
Give her the file.
You can't afford a team.

04:14.505 --> 04:16.086
Adams is free.

04:16.173 --> 04:19.006
And I'm referring
both to her availability
and her price tag.

04:20.511 --> 04:23.628
New girl meet newer girl,
and vice versa.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.266
You said we were
meeting for coffee.

04:26.350 --> 04:28.716
Well, when someone
asks if you want coffee,

04:28.811 --> 04:31.018
they obviously
don't just mean coffee.

04:31.439 --> 04:34.931
Wait. Did you think
I was referring to sex?

04:35.025 --> 04:36.765
Would you
shut the blinds
on your way out?

04:36.861 --> 04:38.852
I thought you were
referring to talking.

04:38.988 --> 04:40.774
Talking about medicine.

04:40.865 --> 04:43.607
Specifically,
as it refers to the guy
whose name is on the file

04:43.701 --> 04:45.692
she still hasn't
handed you.

04:45.828 --> 04:49.696
I'm not working, House.
I'm in the process of
looking for a paying job.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.281
And in the meantime,
there's no way
a do-gooder like you

04:52.376 --> 04:54.116
isn't volunteering
all over town,

04:54.211 --> 04:56.372
ladling kittens,
spaying soup.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.712
There's a free clinic
in Trenton.

04:59.550 --> 05:01.415
Well, think of this
as today's free clinic.

05:01.510 --> 05:03.375
Only with fewer
bums with herpes.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.883
I don't think
we actually have
much of a case.

05:06.015 --> 05:08.347
I think it's
just dehydration.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.596
What happened
the last time
another doctor

05:11.687 --> 05:13.143
told you l was
wrong about a case?

05:13.230 --> 05:14.686
I lost my job.

05:15.399 --> 05:16.730
But you saved a life.

05:20.362 --> 05:23.650
Is an ultrasound
really necessary?
I'm feeling much better now.

05:23.741 --> 05:25.732
A sudden collapse
at your age can indicate

05:25.826 --> 05:27.487
a deterioration in
the heart muscle,

05:28.037 --> 05:29.743
a pretty serious
condition.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.321
It could also
just be dehydration.

05:32.416 --> 05:34.702
Next time,
you could probably
drop the undercover act.

05:35.044 --> 05:36.033
(CHUCKLES)

05:36.128 --> 05:40.167
I walk in in a suit,
and they're gonna put
their best foot forward.

05:40.257 --> 05:42.213
Also I don't own a suit.

05:43.052 --> 05:45.589
You give away millions,
and you don't own a suit?

05:45.679 --> 05:47.180
I gave those away too.

05:47.932 --> 05:49.888
One day l was writing
a check to my landscaper,

05:49.975 --> 05:51.511
and it suddenly hit me,
(LAUGHS)

05:51.602 --> 05:55.766
$6,000 to take out plants
and put in different plants

05:55.898 --> 05:58.014
so I can look at them.

05:58.108 --> 06:00.269
Shouldn't I use that money
to do something important?

06:00.402 --> 06:03.690
And by money,
you mean
all your money.

06:03.781 --> 06:05.021
I started with
$10 million,

06:05.115 --> 06:09.609
and then I couldn't
think of a reason
not to give 20 or 40.

06:11.747 --> 06:13.703
I figure I can live
on $25,000 a year.

06:14.124 --> 06:18.709
One room apartment,
bus pass, thrift stores,
bare necessities.

06:18.796 --> 06:21.287
I still have
my software company.

06:21.423 --> 06:24.551
And when I make more,
I'll give that away too.

06:24.635 --> 06:26.466
He's nuts.
He's generous.

06:26.971 --> 06:29.462
There's a neurological
issue. He's getting
rid of everything.

06:29.598 --> 06:32.214
His echocardiogram
was negative
for cardiomyopathy.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.561
Head CT showed no signs
of stroke or hemorrhage.

06:34.645 --> 06:36.055
He has one pair of pants!

06:36.146 --> 06:37.886
Most people with
his kind of money

06:37.982 --> 06:40.894
are commissioning
oil paintings of
their Yorkshire terrier.

06:40.985 --> 06:44.227
Benjamin is
sacrificing his own comfort
to help others.

06:44.321 --> 06:47.563
That's 'cause helping others
is his Yorkie oil painting.

06:47.658 --> 06:49.899
That's good, not sick.

06:49.994 --> 06:51.734
That's naive and sick.

06:51.829 --> 06:53.990
You really want to
improve things, you
do it through policy.

06:54.123 --> 06:56.739
This guy
empties his pockets,
what really changes?

06:56.834 --> 06:59.917
That's right.
All those babies with AIDS,
they're just using us.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.836
My parents had
$800 between them
when they got here.

07:02.965 --> 07:05.672
They scraped and
borrowed so we could
go to good schools.

07:05.759 --> 07:09.092
And I worked my ass off.
No one gave me a handout.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.305
It makes me work harder.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.096
Rebuﬂal

07:13.183 --> 07:15.310
What's your evil plan?

07:15.394 --> 07:16.930
I object to your cynicism.

07:17.021 --> 07:19.012
It's been earned.
That's what I object to.

07:19.148 --> 07:21.560
New Dean of Medicine
has an ethical
obligation to come in

07:21.692 --> 07:23.933
with a completely open mind
about all employees,

07:24.028 --> 07:27.191
thus letting me
blithely run roughshod
for at least four weeks.

07:27.531 --> 07:29.738
My theory is that
you're running
a battery of tests

07:29.867 --> 07:31.573
to convince him that
you've saved his life,

07:31.702 --> 07:33.658
and then con him
into funding you to
hire back your team.

07:33.746 --> 07:35.236
What?
Your old team?

07:36.081 --> 07:38.037
What?
This is your new reality.

07:38.167 --> 07:40.328
You've got your office,
you've got neighbors,

07:40.419 --> 07:42.080
you've got one employee,
one volunteer

07:42.212 --> 07:45.045
until she finds
actual paid work
or gets sick of you.

07:45.174 --> 07:48.041
I talked to Chase and Taub.
They're willing to come back.

07:49.011 --> 07:50.421
What about Thirteen?

07:50.554 --> 07:55.048
Not a good choice.
She's not a long-term,
because she has no long-term.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.060
Not taking your calls?

07:58.729 --> 07:59.844
She will.

07:59.938 --> 08:01.439
Discharge the patient.

08:01.565 --> 08:04.932
Unexplained loss
of consciousness
could be cardiomyopathy,

08:05.069 --> 08:07.105
global anoxia,
subarachnoid hemorrhage...

08:07.237 --> 08:09.899
Dehydration.
He was given fluids,
and he got better.

08:10.032 --> 08:11.363
And I'm sure your tests
have come up negative,

08:11.450 --> 08:13.315
or you'd have
shut me up already.

08:13.410 --> 08:14.570
Which means he goes home.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.238
CHI: There is a symptom.

08:19.875 --> 08:21.411
Extreme altruism.

08:25.798 --> 08:27.629
You've got
two choices, House.

08:27.758 --> 08:29.840
You can recognize
that your patient is just

08:29.927 --> 08:32.043
a very nice, healthy guy
and send him home.

08:32.137 --> 08:34.719
Or you can consider
altruism a symptom,

08:34.807 --> 08:37.389
in which case,
you cannot take his money.

08:42.398 --> 08:44.559
Send him home.

08:44.650 --> 08:47.608
And check with admitting
for the net worth
of all new patients.

08:54.076 --> 08:55.782
(WOMAN TALKING ON PA)

08:59.957 --> 09:02.118
THIRTEEN: I'm not
coming back, House.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.456
Technically,
you're back right now.

09:09.341 --> 09:11.923
I need you to
stop calling me.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.875
The first 17 messages
were cute, but...

09:13.971 --> 09:16.212
I'm putting
the band back together.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.467
Interesting that
you've never showed up
at my place,

09:18.559 --> 09:20.140
what with your
love of annoying me

09:20.227 --> 09:23.060
and your inability to
take no for an answer.

09:23.147 --> 09:24.557
I'm guessing ankle monitor.

09:28.819 --> 09:32.311
Guilty as charged.
Literally.

09:33.949 --> 09:35.485
I'm not a doctor
any more, House.

09:36.618 --> 09:39.610
The job went away
but not the profession.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.742
You look healthy,
so that's not it.

09:45.169 --> 09:47.410
You met a boy or a girl,

09:48.464 --> 09:50.329
fallen in love,
wanna be happy.

09:50.924 --> 09:54.462
You've decided
to enjoy what
time you have left.

09:56.513 --> 09:57.923
You're going to Thailand.

10:00.267 --> 10:03.304
Girl. And Mykonos.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.600
(YAWNING)

10:05.355 --> 10:06.856
Turns out I like boring.

10:06.982 --> 10:09.018
No, you want to
like boring.

10:09.151 --> 10:10.357
But if you
actually liked boring,

10:10.444 --> 10:12.935
you would have figured
that out in fifth grade
when you were bored.

10:13.030 --> 10:15.271
Please, stop calling me.

10:18.786 --> 10:20.117
No.

10:21.705 --> 10:24.538
You showed up to tell me
that you don't
want to hear from me.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.957
That's a mixed signal.

10:27.044 --> 10:30.286
And I'm gonna choose to
listen to your actions
rather than your words,

10:30.380 --> 10:31.665
'cause they're more honest.

10:38.722 --> 10:40.132
BENJAMIN:
I'm a little confused.

10:40.224 --> 10:42.465
The test is
designed to determine
if your nerves are...

10:42.559 --> 10:45.551
No, I meant
you're running a test
and discharging me?

10:45.646 --> 10:47.978
Was I dehydrated or not?

10:48.065 --> 10:50.977
I think so. But out of
an abundance of caution,

10:51.068 --> 10:53.684
my colleague has
taken it upon herself
to do one more test.

10:54.238 --> 10:55.353
All right.

10:58.242 --> 10:59.903
You scare me a little.

to Doctors Without Borders,

11:09.211 --> 11:12.829
and that seems
like a huge sacrifice,

11:12.923 --> 11:15.335
You don't scare her.
You make her feel guilty.

11:17.511 --> 11:20.093
You like your life
the way it is.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.091
Most people give the minimum
they have to give,

11:22.182 --> 11:23.683
so they can enjoy
what they have left.

11:23.767 --> 11:27.680
I guess my minimum is
just higher than most.

My chest.

something wrong with him.

11:56.925 --> 12:00.042
Which is awesome.
Now, there's
something to cure,

12:00.137 --> 12:01.468
which means
there's something to be

12:01.555 --> 12:04.422
disproportionately
financially grateful for.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.757
Morning.
Got you coffee.

12:06.852 --> 12:08.058
Thanks.

12:08.145 --> 12:10.227
Arrhythmia could easily
have caused the collapse

12:10.314 --> 12:14.432
that landed
Father Teresa here
in the first place.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.687
Oh,Wsﬁne
Keepit

12:16.778 --> 12:18.279
We looked at
his heart yesterday.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.103
Didn't see any
structural abnormalities.

12:20.198 --> 12:21.904
I'm thinking
occult long QT syndrome?

12:21.992 --> 12:22.981
What about Whipple's?

12:23.076 --> 12:25.567
If it was Whipple's,
there'd be some kind
of neurological involvement.

12:25.662 --> 12:28.074
You don't think
defying human nature
is neurological?

12:28.165 --> 12:30.030
Racing heart,
medical condition.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.956
Bleeding heart,
stupid condition.

12:32.044 --> 12:33.625
Are you saying that
because you believe it,

12:33.712 --> 12:36.328
or because it's
in your financial
best interests

12:36.423 --> 12:39.039
to think his generosity
isn't just temporary?

12:39.134 --> 12:42.626
I'm told that
some people are
just nice.

12:42.721 --> 12:44.257
I'm trying to
embrace that wisdom.

12:44.348 --> 12:47.340
Benjamin's been
taking allergy medication
the last few weeks.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.766
Long QT syndrome
can be medication-induced.

12:50.145 --> 12:52.352
Flush him with saline.
Get rid
of the antihistamines.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.350
Then do an EKG.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.432
No, wait.
I'll do the flushing.

12:57.736 --> 12:59.442
And take
the damn two dollars.

12:59.529 --> 13:00.985
She hasn't even
sipped the coffee.

13:04.785 --> 13:08.118
I just got so angry
you know? ’

13:08.205 --> 13:10.742
So I made
a terrible mistake,

13:10.832 --> 13:13.665
and now, I'm trying
to start my life over.

13:13.752 --> 13:15.834
To help people
the way I always wanted.

13:17.297 --> 13:21.666
But my department
got defunded,
and it's my fault.

13:23.261 --> 13:26.424
I just can't stand to
think of all those
patients going untreated

13:26.515 --> 13:29.848
because I don't
have the resources
to do my best work.

13:31.561 --> 13:32.767
How about
I help you out?

13:33.814 --> 13:35.770
How do you mean?

13:37.067 --> 13:39.649
I'll give a million dollars
as an endowment
to the hospital

13:39.736 --> 13:40.942
earmarked for Diagnostics.

13:42.864 --> 13:43.944
Wow.

13:45.909 --> 13:50.699
I'm an opportunistic ex-con
who just gave you
a two-minute sob story

13:50.789 --> 13:52.905
as step three
in my master plan,

13:53.000 --> 13:56.333
and you've offered me
a million dollars.

13:56.420 --> 13:57.876
Which was step 17.

13:59.965 --> 14:01.045
Is that bad?

14:03.301 --> 14:05.838
Ethics are not
my strong suit.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.967
Hypothetical.

14:10.058 --> 14:14.597
If I'm offered
oral sex from a sexaholic,
do I have to decline?

14:14.980 --> 14:18.518
Don't answer yet.
Saying "no" will
cause both of us pain.

14:18.608 --> 14:20.348
Saying "yes" will
cause both of us pleasure.

14:21.069 --> 14:22.855
You can't take sex
from a sexaholic,

14:22.946 --> 14:24.982
you can't give
booze to an alcoholic,

14:25.073 --> 14:26.574
and you can't take
this guy's money.

14:26.658 --> 14:29.525
I could be wrong
about the symptom.
I'm wrong all the time.

14:29.619 --> 14:33.487
Taking money from
a sick person is
ethically suspect at best.

14:33.582 --> 14:36.790
What is this? Canada?
All we do is take money
from sick people.

14:36.877 --> 14:37.912
We work for it.

14:38.003 --> 14:38.992
I'm working.

14:39.671 --> 14:40.786
How much?

14:41.757 --> 14:42.837
$20.

14:43.925 --> 14:46.302
Well, what if it was?
It's the same principle.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.464
$20, a million,
what's the difference?

14:49.598 --> 14:52.260
Actually, the difference
is pretty much
a million dollars.

14:52.851 --> 14:54.387
He came up
with the figure,
not me.

14:54.770 --> 14:55.850
(PAGER BEEPING)

14:56.104 --> 15:00.438
Crap. Got a patient
with end-stage
renal disease.

15:00.525 --> 15:02.265
Her heart can't
support dialysis.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.396
She needs a transplant
but...

15:04.488 --> 15:07.446
You tuned out as soon
as it stopped being
about you, didn't you?

15:07.532 --> 15:09.068
What?
I got to go.

15:09.159 --> 15:12.151
It's all moot.
The patient probably
has long QT.

15:12.245 --> 15:15.157
He's probablyjust a really,
really decent person.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.454
They exist, right?

15:16.541 --> 15:19.203
You can't take
the money, House.

15:19.294 --> 15:21.535
ls long QT bad?

15:22.464 --> 15:25.581
It's a tough thing
to control.

15:25.675 --> 15:28.337
Is there someone
you want me to call?

15:29.304 --> 15:31.215
There's someone
I would like to call.

15:31.640 --> 15:34.848
She's the same person
who won't take my calls.

15:36.019 --> 15:37.475
My wife.

15:39.147 --> 15:41.388
When I started
giving away the money,

15:41.483 --> 15:43.690
I hoped she'd want
to do it with me.

15:45.237 --> 15:46.647
She didn't.

15:49.157 --> 15:51.148
I miss them.
(INHALES SHARPLY)

15:51.660 --> 15:52.991
I have two little boys.

15:56.832 --> 15:59.665
Having a family
doesn't exempt me
from social responsibility.

15:59.751 --> 16:01.787
But family comes first.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.038
But should it?

16:03.421 --> 16:06.458
I know that sounds weird.

16:06.550 --> 16:07.960
But if someone is
related to you,

16:08.051 --> 16:10.133
does that empirically
make them more special,

16:10.220 --> 16:11.835
more deserving
than anyone else?

16:12.347 --> 16:14.554
Yes, it gives you
a responsibility.

16:14.641 --> 16:18.475
My boys have
a roof over their heads.
They're not starving.

16:22.232 --> 16:23.972
I pay court-ordered
child support.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.809
And frankly,
it's more than they need.

16:28.572 --> 16:31.484
I love them
more than anything.

16:31.575 --> 16:34.658
I can'tjustify
buying video games
and private schools

16:34.744 --> 16:37.907
when other people's
children are starving.

16:39.416 --> 16:41.623
I hope one day
they'll understand that.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.247
Your hands are trembling.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.714
Is it the electrodes?

16:46.798 --> 16:48.174
Are you in pain?

16:48.258 --> 16:50.840
No. What's happening?

16:50.927 --> 16:52.963
I'm not sure,
but it's not what
we thought it was.

16:57.184 --> 17:01.974
So arrhythmia,
fainting,
muscle tremors.

17:02.105 --> 17:04.687
Plus unfortunately,
mental changes.

17:08.778 --> 17:11.986
I still don't think
it's neurological.

17:12.115 --> 17:13.195
God bless you.

17:13.283 --> 17:16.116
He lost his wife and kids,
'cause he couldn't
stop giving money away.

17:16.203 --> 17:20.321
He lost his wife,
because she couldn't accept
not being filthy rich.

17:20.457 --> 17:22.163
She's not drinking
the coffee either.

17:22.292 --> 17:26.626
Drink it, don't drink it.
The point is I gave it
to you, so we're even.

17:27.964 --> 17:32.628
Even? It was a gift,
an insignificant token.
There was nothing owed.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.300
That was the whole point.

17:34.679 --> 17:35.885
VVhy?

17:36.014 --> 17:37.220
”Why?”

17:37.307 --> 17:38.638
Yeah. Why?

17:39.559 --> 17:40.799
She's the crazy one.

17:41.269 --> 17:45.182
So a guy gives
everything away
to strangers, sane.

17:45.273 --> 17:48.731
Girl who doesn't
want anything from
strangers, crazy?

17:48.818 --> 17:50.149
You're not a stranger.

17:50.237 --> 17:52.228
And your perverse
view of the world is

17:52.322 --> 17:54.233
making you force
a neurological component

17:54.324 --> 17:55.814
onto an obviously
cardiological...

17:55.909 --> 17:57.900
Your parents
didn't love you enough,

17:57.994 --> 17:59.905
so you need to
prove your superiority.

17:59.996 --> 18:03.329
Or they loved you too much,
so you need to
prove your humility.

18:04.042 --> 18:07.660
Or it's just rich guilt.
I'm betting on the last one.

18:10.340 --> 18:12.956
There's a whole list of
drugs that could have
caused his symptoms.

18:13.051 --> 18:14.757
I doubt the guy would
spend money on drugs

18:14.844 --> 18:16.835
when there are
orphans out there
without cable.

18:16.930 --> 18:19.467
Anyway, he'd be
getting better right now,
not worse.

18:19.557 --> 18:22.094
Could be
polyarteritis nodosa.

18:22.185 --> 18:23.300
That comes with a rash.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.518
Echovirus.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.016
(IMITATES ECHO)
Virus, virus, virus...

18:28.483 --> 18:30.644
Fits his physical symptoms.

18:30.735 --> 18:35.024
And could,
but doesn't necessarily,
cause personality changes.

18:35.407 --> 18:36.522
Works for everyone?

18:37.784 --> 18:39.115
Start him on antivirals.

18:39.911 --> 18:42.493
And, Adams,
when you treat,

18:42.580 --> 18:46.414
and he gets better and
doesn't give Bob Cratchit
Christmas Day off,

18:46.501 --> 18:48.537
you owe me a coffee.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.833
THIRTEEN:
Click the third tab
from the left

18:52.924 --> 18:55.085
and find a box that
says "previous entry."

18:55.176 --> 18:56.791
You get a drop-down
menu that’s sorted

18:56.886 --> 18:59.013
by patient name
and department.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.883
Thank you.
I appreciate your help.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.589
You're gonna read
too much into this,
aren't you?

19:02.684 --> 19:04.049
No. Not at all.

19:04.144 --> 19:05.350
We're going to
fundamentally disagree

19:05.437 --> 19:08.179
about what it means
to read too much
into this, aren't we?

19:08.273 --> 19:09.888
Yes, absolutely.

19:11.401 --> 19:14.063
Look, I thought about
what you said, and
I realized you were right.

19:14.154 --> 19:16.236
Great.
See you tomorrow morning.

19:16.323 --> 19:17.654
No, you won't.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.278
Afternoon? I can't think
of another interpretation.

19:21.369 --> 19:24.782
Shut up. Look,
I'm not sure what you
were trying to achieve.

19:24.873 --> 19:26.488
I'm never quite sure,
but you were

19:26.583 --> 19:28.369
actually a friend to me
when I needed it.

19:29.419 --> 19:31.375
/ don’t want to come
back to work for you.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.875
But I was wrong to try
to push you out of my life.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.716
Everything has gone blue.

19:39.387 --> 19:42.424
That’s not supposed
to happen, right?

19:42.515 --> 19:44.631
Stay there.
I'm coming.

19:44.768 --> 19:46.804
No, you don't
have to do that.

19:46.936 --> 19:50.474
Although if you did come,
maybe you could
swing by the Hunan Palace

19:50.607 --> 19:52.893
and get some Lo Mein
and a Szechuan Beef.

19:52.984 --> 19:54.895
That is six miles
out of my way.

19:54.986 --> 19:58.023
Okay, then, I guess
I'll just get something
from the hospital cafeteria,

19:58.114 --> 20:01.447
which is where
I get all of my meals
since I can't go anywhere.

20:02.619 --> 20:04.359
(SIGHING) Fine.
I'll get the food.

20:04.454 --> 20:05.443
You’re a peach.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.450
I started the last
round of pleconaril.

20:12.629 --> 20:13.960
Can you do me a favor?

20:15.215 --> 20:16.671
A favor?

20:21.388 --> 20:23.128
You want me to
return these?

20:23.223 --> 20:26.715
Give them to someone?
Wear them
while you masturbate?

20:28.311 --> 20:30.302
I want you to have them.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.395
That's not a favor.

20:32.482 --> 20:36.521
It was a two-for-one sale.
I couldn't resist. I need
to justify buying them.

20:36.653 --> 20:39.190
They're $120.

20:39.322 --> 20:42.234
My car's in the shop.
I'm short on cash
this month.

20:42.325 --> 20:44.065
I can't pay you back.

20:44.160 --> 20:47.744
The first pair were $120.
These were free.

20:49.833 --> 20:52.370
You do know
I punched the last person
that pissed me off?

20:54.170 --> 20:55.250
Was it Santa?

21:11.604 --> 21:14.311
What's your
patient's status?

21:14.399 --> 21:16.731
Better.
We're discharging him.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.934
(SIGHS) Good.

21:20.071 --> 21:22.687
Hey, hey.
Why do you care?

21:23.950 --> 21:27.488
Specifically.
Although, I'm curious
about a general answer too.

21:27.579 --> 21:30.787
Your guyjust signed up
to donate a kidney to
my patient with renal failure.

21:33.209 --> 21:34.995
Did he meet your patient
with renal failure?

21:35.086 --> 21:38.419
No. He heard
the nurses talking about her,
that she was short on time.

21:41.301 --> 21:42.461
I was wrong.

21:42.552 --> 21:45.669
Don't say that.
House, she really
needs this kidney.

21:45.763 --> 21:48.891
He's not better.
His mental status
is declining.

21:48.975 --> 21:52.809
Or he's doing
an amazing thing for
another human being.

21:53.229 --> 21:54.890
I thought it was
an ethical no-brainer

21:54.981 --> 21:56.767
that we can't take
stuff from sick people.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.557
I changed my mind.

22:07.619 --> 22:08.984
He's still sick.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.363
His symptoms
have gone away.

22:10.455 --> 22:14.539
Not all of them.
Offering an organ to
a stranger is a symptom.

22:14.626 --> 22:17.709
A couple dozen people
a year make undirected
kidney donations.

22:17.795 --> 22:20.502
How many of them
are also in the process
of pauperizing themselves?

22:20.590 --> 22:22.956
If the guy threw
himself on a grenade,
he'd be a hero.

22:23.092 --> 22:24.957
If it saves a life,
who cares?

22:25.094 --> 22:29.087
You do.
Yesterday when you made
the exact opposite argument.

22:30.350 --> 22:32.136
If there's even
a chance I'm right,

22:32.268 --> 22:33.849
it'd be dangerous
to give his kidney
to someone else.

22:33.937 --> 22:38.351
More dangerous than
complete renal failure?
My patient needs this now.

22:38.441 --> 22:39.772
Why do you want to
give away your kidney?

22:41.110 --> 22:42.611
There are 70,000
people in this country

22:42.695 --> 22:44.151
on the active
waiting list
for a kidney,

22:44.280 --> 22:46.487
andlessthan
10,000 dead people a year
to give them one.

22:46.616 --> 22:49.779
Yeah, if only
we could kill 60,000
more people a year,

22:49.869 --> 22:51.154
all would be golden.

22:51.287 --> 22:52.322
I'll give you
your money.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.373
See? Crazy.

22:54.457 --> 22:56.118
Being alive donor
has risks.

22:56.209 --> 22:59.793
I looked it up.
The risk is one in 4,000.
I could die during surgery.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.790
Which means
if I don't donate,

23:01.881 --> 23:04.463
I'm valuing my life
at 4,000 times
someone else's.

23:05.843 --> 23:07.379
It's not like
I want to be cut open

23:07.470 --> 23:09.461
and have a part of me
taken out,

23:09.556 --> 23:12.798
but I've got two,
and this woman has none.
She'll die without it.

23:13.309 --> 23:14.469
Perfectly logical.

23:15.562 --> 23:17.644
People with
mental deficiency
can be logical.

23:17.814 --> 23:19.896
Just like sane people
can be illogical.

23:19.983 --> 23:22.395
This kidney thing is
the only evidence
you have that he's sick.

23:25.196 --> 23:27.653
I'm going to
let him be a donor.

23:31.661 --> 23:33.993
Dr. House,
it's not a symptom.

23:35.373 --> 23:36.863
Come back after
you're convinced
that I'm healthy,

23:37.000 --> 23:38.831
and I will give you
your money.

23:39.669 --> 23:41.330
No, you won't.

23:46.551 --> 23:48.963
We have time for
one more test
before we move him.

23:49.053 --> 23:50.168
What test?

23:50.263 --> 23:52.675
Whatever test will prove
that it wasn't echovirus...

23:52.849 --> 23:55.511
(IMITATES ECHO)
Virus, virus... And he's
not cured, obviously.

23:55.602 --> 23:57.684
I've been saying all along
this could be Whipple's.

23:57.770 --> 24:01.854
Causes arrhythmia,
tremor and mental changes.

24:01.941 --> 24:04.557
Badidea.
There's no joint pain.

24:04.694 --> 24:05.649
Where's Adams?

24:05.737 --> 24:06.852
We thought
the case was over.

24:06.946 --> 24:09.062
She has a job interview.

24:13.036 --> 24:14.446
Why is she here?

24:14.537 --> 24:15.947
HOUSE:
Because I called her.

24:16.581 --> 24:19.072
Bigger question is
why that worked.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.707
I'm here because
I have time, and
you have a crisis and...

24:21.794 --> 24:23.500
We're too busy for
rationalizations.

24:23.588 --> 24:26.170
Patient made a big downgrade
in his personal life.

24:26.299 --> 24:27.914
He's probably not
eating all that healthy.

24:28.009 --> 24:29.715
Magnesium deficiency?

24:31.179 --> 24:33.716
Wait until they take
him back to his room,
draw blood,

24:33.806 --> 24:36.013
and do an expanded
electrolyte profile.

24:36.100 --> 24:38.637
No, he hasn't had anxiety
or any trouble sleeping.

24:38.728 --> 24:39.888
I think it's
Whipple's disease.

24:39.979 --> 24:42.140
Badidea.
He doesn't have
joint pain.

24:42.231 --> 24:44.267
THIRTEEN:
Joint pain is common
but not definitive.

24:44.359 --> 24:46.145
Whipple's explains
all of his symptoms

24:46.235 --> 24:48.021
including
the personality change.

24:48.112 --> 24:49.648
And it would
respond to antibiotics,

24:49.739 --> 24:51.229
which is why
he started to feel better,

24:51.324 --> 24:52.780
which doesn't mean
he's not still sick.

24:53.785 --> 24:56.993
You were right.
Counts for nothing
if you can't defend it.

24:58.122 --> 25:00.283
Book a procedure room,
do an upper endoscopy,

25:00.375 --> 25:02.912
and run a PCR test
for Whipple's.

25:05.797 --> 25:07.082
Guilt.

25:08.341 --> 25:10.172
You feel guilty
about leaving.

25:10.259 --> 25:12.636
Yes,
I think that little of you
and that much of me.

25:12.720 --> 25:13.880
You're nothing without me.

25:13.971 --> 25:16.348
Not leaving me,
leaving humanity.

25:17.433 --> 25:20.300
I'm going
with my girlfriend,
the woman I love.

25:20.812 --> 25:22.143
To have fun.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.021
You're trying to
make me feel guilty,

25:25.108 --> 25:26.689
because you're
saving lives here.

25:26.776 --> 25:29.392
I think that's great.
I'm proud to have
been a part of it.

25:29.487 --> 25:33.696
But now,
ljust want to be happy.

25:34.951 --> 25:38.239
Well, no one's
unhappy in Greece.

25:41.624 --> 25:43.535
CAROt
Itjust appeared in
the last few weeks.

25:43.626 --> 25:45.662
He's having
trouble holding a pencil
in school.

25:46.003 --> 25:47.413
Does it itch?

25:49.424 --> 25:50.755
Get anything
different lately,

25:50.842 --> 25:53.379
new baseball glove,
new kitten?

25:53.469 --> 25:54.584
The neighbors put in
a pool,

25:54.679 --> 25:56.635
so he's been spending
a lot of time over there.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.839
But if it were
something in the water

25:58.933 --> 26:02.016
it would be everywhere,
wouldn't it?

26:05.606 --> 26:06.937
It is in the water.

26:07.024 --> 26:08.184
He's allergic to chlorine?

26:08.818 --> 26:09.853
No.

26:09.986 --> 26:11.066
(INHALES DEEPLY)

26:11.154 --> 26:13.941
He's allergic
to Summer Lilac.

26:14.615 --> 26:18.107
That's my lotion,
and it's not in the pool.

26:18.202 --> 26:20.659
No, it's on
the palms of his hands.

26:21.539 --> 26:23.621
In the pool,
is the neighbor's daughter

26:25.877 --> 26:28.118
or the neighbor's
hot wife.

26:32.049 --> 26:34.005
Here's some lube.

26:35.219 --> 26:36.959
Sorry.
Too late for your eyesight.

26:47.106 --> 26:50.519
Endoscopy didn't
reveal any lesions
in the small intestine.

26:50.610 --> 26:53.101
I'm running
the PCR test now.

26:55.865 --> 26:59.449
I found it in my office.
Appears to be a gift.

26:59.535 --> 27:01.787
That can't be good.

27:01.871 --> 27:02.951
Damn it.

27:03.039 --> 27:04.449
You got her
the job interview.

27:04.540 --> 27:08.453
And that was supposed
to be the end of it.
I don't take charity.

27:08.544 --> 27:10.330
Good for you, you loon.

27:10.421 --> 27:12.628
ldonter
owing people things.

27:12.715 --> 27:15.001
So either
you're so insecure

27:15.092 --> 27:17.469
that you feel like
you need to always
have the upper hand,

27:17.553 --> 27:21.045
or you're so arrogant
that the notion of a favor
is insulting to you.

27:21.349 --> 27:24.341
Or it's your family,
some kind of
immigrant pride thing.

27:25.228 --> 27:26.513
I'm betting
on the last one.

27:26.604 --> 27:31.644
ljust don't like it.
It makes me feel icky.

27:32.318 --> 27:33.933
That's the reason?
Ickiness?

27:35.071 --> 27:36.686
You never even
tried to analyze this?

27:36.781 --> 27:39.193
That's even crazier
than the gift thing.

27:39.283 --> 27:42.946
House. There's no sign
of tropheryma DNA.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.321
It's not Whipple's.

27:49.043 --> 27:51.159
We did what we could.

27:51.420 --> 27:52.626
(MACHINE BEEPING)

27:56.509 --> 27:58.795
You sure you want
to do this?

27:58.886 --> 28:02.754
Relax. This is gonna
make me very happy.

28:18.990 --> 28:22.733
Dr. Simpson, heart rate's 140,
and pressure's dropping.

28:22.827 --> 28:24.067
(MONITOR BEEPS RAPIDLY)
Get him adenosine, stat.

28:24.161 --> 28:26.777
Patient's unstable.
Surgery's off.

28:30.835 --> 28:33.497
Arrhythmia's back.
He's on heparin
and stable for now,

28:33.588 --> 28:35.704
but this could put him
at risk for
stroke or embolism.

28:35.798 --> 28:37.379
Maybe he got
bit by a spider.

28:37.466 --> 28:39.923
The symptoms can
take up to three days
to manifest.

28:40.011 --> 28:41.342
He'd have localized pain.

28:41.429 --> 28:42.418
LCDD.

28:42.513 --> 28:43.673
Almost always
hits the kidneys.

28:45.516 --> 28:47.973
Ah, Dr. Foreman,
perhaps you can help us.

28:48.227 --> 28:49.967
I can't decide
whether to take out an

28:50.062 --> 28:52.439
I-told-you-so ad in
the New England Journal,

28:52.523 --> 28:55.890
or stay classy
and just spray-paint it
on your car.

28:55.985 --> 28:57.191
You're off the case.

28:58.321 --> 28:59.857
That seems like
an overreaction.

28:59.947 --> 29:02.734
You dosed him.
You couldn't stand
losing him as a patient,

29:02.825 --> 29:04.361
so you faked a symptom
to prove yourself right.

29:04.452 --> 29:05.532
That's idiotic.

29:07.455 --> 29:09.116
Sorry.
HOUSE: Don't apologize.

29:10.249 --> 29:11.910
I don't know
if you're power-crazed

29:12.001 --> 29:13.741
or paranoid,
but I know she's right.

29:14.003 --> 29:15.664
Two lives are in
the balance here.

29:15.755 --> 29:19.122
House, Iworked
for you for seven years.
I know how you operate.

29:19.216 --> 29:22.253
So when I see
symptoms magically show up
right when you need them...

29:22.345 --> 29:23.960
HOUSE: And I was your boss
for seven years,

29:24.055 --> 29:27.172
and I know what
a suspicious, micromanaging
hard-ass you are.

29:27.725 --> 29:32.185
Why would I do this now,
knowing you can send me
right back to jail?

29:32.271 --> 29:33.260
What did you give him?

29:33.356 --> 29:34.596
Nothing.

29:34.690 --> 29:36.851
You can't prove otherwise.

29:36.943 --> 29:40.106
So why don't you do
the smart thing here?

29:40.196 --> 29:44.439
You're off the case.
You no longer have
access to this patient.

29:47.411 --> 29:48.571
You can't let him do this.

29:48.871 --> 29:51.112
(SIGHS) He's the boss.

29:52.792 --> 29:54.032
And he's right.

30:05.179 --> 30:06.840
I assume you
closed the patient

30:06.931 --> 30:10.594
because you're
really certain he has
a neurological condition.

30:10.685 --> 30:14.177
I assume you're
interpreting my actions
in the best possible light

30:14.271 --> 30:15.477
because you
didn't get the job.

30:17.858 --> 30:20.144
What's with
you and Park?

30:20.236 --> 30:21.351
Nothing.

30:22.905 --> 30:25.112
I expect my people to
lie better than that.

30:26.993 --> 30:28.324
Either you're
getting her gifts

30:28.411 --> 30:30.242
because you want
her to like you,

30:30.329 --> 30:31.910
in which case,
I don't like you.

30:31.998 --> 30:34.910
Or you're getting her
gifts to screw with her,

30:35.001 --> 30:39.165
in which case,
I will be teaching you
my secret homie handshake.

I thought it was
interesting

30:43.426 --> 30:45.838
she couldn't
accept that coffee,

30:45.928 --> 30:49.011
and I wanted to see
how deep it went.

30:49.098 --> 30:50.087
But now?

30:50.182 --> 30:52.264
Oh, now,
ljust wanna win.

What was in the box?

30:56.731 --> 30:59.347
Gift certificate.
The spa.

31:00.401 --> 31:04.690
That's not going to do it.
You're up against
a lifetime of training.

31:04.780 --> 31:06.031
If you wanna win,
you've got to do

31:06.115 --> 31:07.855
something she can't
possibly reciprocate.

31:08.868 --> 31:10.779
You've got to push
her neuroses to the point

31:10.870 --> 31:14.283
where even she thinks
that she's crazy.

31:24.800 --> 31:29.214
One more favor,
and I promise I'll
leave you alone forever.

31:29.305 --> 31:30.795
Or I'm lying.

31:30.890 --> 31:33.802
Either way, it's more
interesting than whatever
you're doing now.

31:43.486 --> 31:44.646
Can I help you?

31:44.820 --> 31:45.980
I'm his wife.

31:47.573 --> 31:48.813
We're separated.

31:48.908 --> 31:52.901
I heard he was sick.
ljust wanted to see him.

31:55.664 --> 31:57.791
He's giving a kidney
to someone he's never met?

31:59.418 --> 32:00.658
He wants to, yeah.

32:03.005 --> 32:04.745
I know
he's talked about you.

32:04.840 --> 32:06.580
He's been alone
all this time.

32:06.675 --> 32:08.666
I'm sure it would
mean a lot to him
to see you.

32:10.805 --> 32:13.387
I wanted to spend
my life with him,

32:16.352 --> 32:20.812
but I need to feel
like he loves me
more than other people.

32:20.898 --> 32:22.729
Like he loves
our kids more.

32:25.653 --> 32:27.644
Maybe that's selfish.

32:33.911 --> 32:35.401
I should go.

32:46.257 --> 32:47.588
Was that my wife?

32:47.716 --> 32:49.092
I don't know.

32:50.386 --> 32:52.001
Are you the guy,
the kidney donor?

32:54.723 --> 32:58.716
There was a problem,
but I'm gonna try again.

33:00.563 --> 33:01.552
Um...

33:01.647 --> 33:03.638
To give it to
the same lady?

33:03.732 --> 33:04.892
She needs it.

33:06.068 --> 33:07.854
Okay. Never mind.

33:07.945 --> 33:09.060
Wait.

33:10.239 --> 33:11.729
What do you want?

33:12.741 --> 33:14.902
Uh, it's nothing.
It's just...

33:20.249 --> 33:24.333
Ihave
polycystic kidney disease,
and I need a transplant,

33:24.420 --> 33:25.910
and they say
I don't have much time.

33:26.046 --> 33:28.662
So when I heard
that you were willing,
| just...

33:28.757 --> 33:31.248
But I'm glad
it's going to someone.

33:34.680 --> 33:35.760
I'll give it to you.

33:39.935 --> 33:42.187
But you already
promised it
to someone else.

33:42.271 --> 33:44.262
I have another one.

33:44.398 --> 33:47.856
Saving one life is good,
saving two is better.

33:48.194 --> 33:50.355
You give away two kidneys,
and you die.

33:50.446 --> 33:53.108
I could live on
dialysis for years.

33:53.240 --> 33:55.105
Yes, and then you die.

33:55.201 --> 33:59.535
And then I could
donate my other organs,
heart, lungs.

34:00.956 --> 34:02.947
I could save four
or five more lives.

34:21.310 --> 34:23.892
Foreman's going to
need a diagnostician.

34:23.979 --> 34:26.641

34:32.321 --> 34:35.484
Arrhythmia, muscle tremors,
and yes, mental changes.

34:35.616 --> 34:38.323
If his heart doesn't rupture,
he's liable to rip it out
and give it away.

34:38.827 --> 34:40.613
You know,
the down vibe in here is

34:40.704 --> 34:43.491
totally ruining my
Charlie’s Angels fantasy.

(MACHINERY WHIRRING)

34:45.334 --> 34:47.666
And that haircut
isn't helping, either.

34:47.753 --> 34:50.745
Seems like Graves disease
or some other thyroid issue.

were within normal range
when he was admitted.

No pericarditis.

35:03.102 --> 35:05.434
What about porphyria?
It's a little weird
without the rash,

35:05.521 --> 35:07.011
but it fits all of
his other symptoms.

35:07.356 --> 35:09.438
And if it's acute
intermittent porphyria,

35:09.525 --> 35:11.516
that would explain
why his symptoms
keep recurring.

but it's possible.
What else?

35:15.656 --> 35:17.271
(MACHINE CONTINUES WHIRRING)

35:17.366 --> 35:18.697
I said, "What else?"

35:22.037 --> 35:24.619
Oh, for crying out loud.

35:28.210 --> 35:29.416
(WHIRRING STOPS)

35:40.389 --> 35:43.381
There, that's better.
Now, what else?

35:49.815 --> 35:51.931
Well, if there's
nothing better
than possible,

35:52.026 --> 35:54.108
then possible gets
upgraded to probable.

35:54.611 --> 35:55.896
I'll start him
on hematin.

35:55.988 --> 35:57.273
No, I'll go.

36:04.705 --> 36:07.071
So what's the answer?

36:07.166 --> 36:10.750
Are you now on the team,
like, forever?

36:10.836 --> 36:12.576
I don't know.

36:12.671 --> 36:15.287
Because I was thinking
of ordering t-shirts.

36:15.382 --> 36:18.874
I don't know, House.
I mean,
what am I supposed to do?

36:19.386 --> 36:23.595
I trained to be a doctor.
I know how to take
someone's pain away,

36:23.682 --> 36:25.843
how to make
a stopped heart
beat again.

36:26.852 --> 36:30.595
We've brought
people's kids back,
their husbands.

36:32.524 --> 36:33.684
So guilt?

36:33.776 --> 36:37.985
Yes, you were right.
You're always right.
ljust...

36:39.406 --> 36:41.988
I have the skills
to help people.

36:42.076 --> 36:47.161
Is it okay for me to
walk away from that
because I wanna just have fun?

36:49.083 --> 36:50.163
Obviously not.

36:50.417 --> 36:51.657
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

37:01.845 --> 37:04.052
How's your patient?

37:04.723 --> 37:06.805
She died a few hours ago.

37:14.942 --> 37:16.773
Thirteen's back.

37:18.987 --> 37:20.978
No department,
no money,

37:21.073 --> 37:23.735
and somehow,
you manage to con her
into hanging around.

37:24.868 --> 37:26.404
I have a gift.

37:32.418 --> 37:33.498
What?

37:33.669 --> 37:34.829
It was a con.

37:35.754 --> 37:36.834
The patient was faking?

37:37.172 --> 37:38.833
No, lwas.

37:41.552 --> 37:46.421
I brought him in here
under false pretenses
just to get his money.

37:47.266 --> 37:49.473
I ordered
a bunch of random tests
to keep him here.

37:49.560 --> 37:54.054
One of them was a head CT
which uses iodine contrast.

37:54.148 --> 37:55.513
You think he's
allergic to iodine?

37:55.774 --> 37:57.310
No. Again.

37:57.401 --> 37:59.312
Just don't interrupt me.

37:59.403 --> 38:02.645
Thirteen was right.
This is a thyroid issue.

38:05.742 --> 38:07.733
He has Plummer's disease.

38:11.331 --> 38:16.075
He has a nodule
in his thyroid.
It produces excess hormone.

38:16.170 --> 38:19.879
Not enough to test abnormal,
just more than
his brain was used to.

38:19.965 --> 38:22.297
Just enough to make him
irrational/y generous,

38:22.384 --> 38:24.466
make him
vulnerable to overheating.

38:24.553 --> 38:26.418
WILSON:
Then you pumped his body
full of iodine

38:26.513 --> 38:28.094
and kicked him
into thyrotoxicosis.

38:28.182 --> 38:30.343
I said don’t interrupt.

38:30.434 --> 38:34.393
But yes, you’re right.
We take out the nodule.
He’ll be fine.

38:48.619 --> 38:50.985
Two days, one surgery.

38:52.372 --> 38:55.159
I now accept that
you are all better.

38:56.210 --> 38:57.199
Where's my money?

38:57.294 --> 38:58.579
You made me sick.

38:58.670 --> 39:03.664
You were already sick.
I just made you much,
much worse.

39:04.885 --> 39:06.921
Seriously, the money.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.552
You're not giving
it to me, are you?

39:13.393 --> 39:18.057
When you're facing death,
some things come into focus...

39:19.525 --> 39:20.514
My wife...

39:20.609 --> 39:22.600
You love your family.
You want them back.

39:24.279 --> 39:27.066
Your altruism was
always a symptom.

39:27.824 --> 39:29.951
No, it wasn't.
I'm still gonna...

39:30.035 --> 39:32.617
Give less?
How much less?

39:32.704 --> 39:33.910
Just enough to
spoil your kids?

39:33.997 --> 39:35.157
No.

39:35.249 --> 39:37.365
But they need it
more than people with TB

39:37.459 --> 39:39.495
or children in Indonesia
with no eyes?

39:39.920 --> 39:41.831
Diagnosticians
with hearts of gold?

39:41.922 --> 39:44.789
I don't want
to give you money
because you're an ass.

39:47.135 --> 39:48.511
I was an ass last week.

39:51.890 --> 39:56.008
I love my family.
I want to be with them.

39:58.021 --> 39:59.557
That doesn't make me
a bad person.

39:59.773 --> 40:00.853
No.

40:02.025 --> 40:03.401
It makes you
a healthy person.

40:14.621 --> 40:18.113
My mechanic called.
Said the work's
been paid for.

40:18.208 --> 40:20.164
You mentioned your
car was in the shop.

40:20.252 --> 40:22.709
That's $4,500.

40:23.547 --> 40:27.756
Smile and say thank you,
or I get you GPS.

40:31.179 --> 40:32.339
You win.

40:37.185 --> 40:38.220
Thank you.

40:48.530 --> 40:52.193
Your car's getting fixed.
You were right.
She went for it.

40:53.619 --> 40:55.280
Good work.

40:56.204 --> 40:59.788
Need a lift tomorrow?
Your car's still in the shop.

40:59.875 --> 41:01.831
I don't take charity.

41:01.918 --> 41:03.374
I'm just glad it's over.

41:05.922 --> 41:08.049
Nothing is ever over.

41:29.321 --> 41:30.731
HOUSE: Thirteen.

41:32.449 --> 41:33.985
Need a minute.

41:41.750 --> 41:42.830
You're fired.

41:43.669 --> 41:45.000
Now what?
House, I'm starving...

41:45.087 --> 41:46.418
I'm notjoking.

41:47.422 --> 41:49.003
You're fired.
Don't come in tomorrow.

41:49.091 --> 41:50.126
House”.

41:51.927 --> 41:54.043
I can work with people
who've got nowhere else
to go,

41:54.137 --> 41:55.673
people who've got
something to prove,

41:55.764 --> 41:57.595
people who just get off
on weird cases.

41:57.766 --> 42:00.883
Who I can't work with
is someone who's here

42:00.977 --> 42:02.763
so she doesn't
have to feel bad.

42:06.775 --> 42:08.356
You're trying to save me.

42:08.443 --> 42:11.935
Yes,
I think that little of you
and that much of me.

42:24.126 --> 42:25.286
Okay.

42:29.631 --> 42:30.996
Bye, House.
