- Hey. Oh. Excuse me, girls.

14:35.445 --> 14:38.578
You ready with
those trophies? I want them
out for the party tonight.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.911
- Right here.
- Great.

14:40.911 --> 14:43.083
- See you.
- See you.

15:09.139 --> 15:13.013
Hey, Dad, you don't have
to take down your trophies
to make room for mine.

15:13.013 --> 15:17.287
I want everyone to see how proud
I am of my future gold medalist.

15:17.287 --> 15:19.689
This really means
a lot to you.

15:19.689 --> 15:25.155
You mean a lot to me.
Because you have the same
fire to compete that I have.

15:25.155 --> 15:29.359
- We're always
gonna have that bond.
- No matter what happens?

15:31.601 --> 15:34.404
- What's gonna happen?
- [laughs]

15:34.404 --> 15:38.138
Yeah. Nothing could ever change
our relationship, could it?

15:38.138 --> 15:42.942
Not a chance, because we
both know what's important.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.675
It's you and me together,
just like always.

15:45.675 --> 15:48.078
I love you, Dad.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.152
I love you too, sweet girl.

15:57.487 --> 16:02.692
You know what they say, Brian,
about one man's junk?

16:02.692 --> 16:06.136
- Is this a dirty joke?
- No!

16:06.136 --> 16:09.739
They say one man's junk
is another man's treasure.

16:09.739 --> 16:12.202
- Let's hope that man's on eBay.
- Mm-hm.

16:12.202 --> 16:16.646
- Hey, look, we got a bid on
the Bill Clinton bobblehead.
- Ooh, how much?

16:16.646 --> 16:18.978
- Five dollars?
- Yeah.

16:18.978 --> 16:23.383
We'll keep putting
whatever we can find
on here and it'll add up.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.615
- Little by little.
- Mm-hm.

16:25.615 --> 16:29.559
- I can sell my X-Men maquettes.
- I wouldn't hear of it.

16:29.559 --> 16:31.191
I've got
a few irons in the fire.

16:31.191 --> 16:34.764
- Well, I'm sure I can
find something to sell.
- OK

16:38.598 --> 16:44.704
- What is up with all the junk?
- Oh, you know,
I'm just getting rid of stuff.

16:44.704 --> 16:47.607
When you got this, you said
you couldn't live without it.

16:47.607 --> 16:52.212
Well, obviously, it's done its
job and I no longer need it.

16:53.743 --> 16:57.087
- OK. So I have bad news.
- Yeah?

16:57.087 --> 17:02.252
We have to buy our new Rock
warm-ups and leos for Nationals.
And they're not cheap.

17:02.252 --> 17:06.556
Nor should they be.
You girls can't be
flippin' around in rags.

17:06.556 --> 17:10.029
- How not cheap are we talking?
- A hundred and eighty dollars.

17:10.029 --> 17:14.504
Is that all? You had me
worried there for a second. No
problem. We'll take care of it.

17:14.504 --> 17:17.137
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hm.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.369
Let me see that checkbook.

17:20.640 --> 17:24.244
- Is this for real?
- Yes. Your brother balanced it.

17:24.244 --> 17:26.776
- So we really are OK.
- I told you.

17:26.776 --> 17:29.379
I wish you'd
trust me for once.

17:29.379 --> 17:32.682
Now go get ready
for the Cruz's party.
We don't want to be late.

17:32.682 --> 17:34.754
OK.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.469
Hey, Joe.

17:51.301 --> 17:53.443
Yeah, I know what I said,

17:53.443 --> 17:56.746
but... I need your help.

17:59.479 --> 18:02.612
- Can't the maid hang this?
- Seriously?

18:02.612 --> 18:05.655
Uh, yeah.
That's what they're paid for.

18:05.655 --> 18:08.358
I just want this
stupid party to be over.

18:08.358 --> 18:12.522
- That's the spirit.
- Hey, Kaylie, do you
have a dress I can wear?

18:12.522 --> 18:15.695
- You, in a dress?
- What? I just
want to look nice.

18:15.695 --> 18:18.128
- For Nicky Russo?
- Ooh!

18:18.128 --> 18:22.572
- What are you talking about?
- The secret little pow-wows
you've been having all week.

18:22.572 --> 18:26.836
"Oh Nicky, Sasha's
making me rest my back.
What ever shall I do?"

18:26.836 --> 18:29.279
"I'd be happy
to stretch you out."

18:29.279 --> 18:31.711
- "Let's get started
with hip flexors."
- [laughs]

18:31.711 --> 18:36.246
- You guys are gross.
- OK. What kind
of dress do you need?

18:36.246 --> 18:40.690
I don't know. Something
you haven't worn a lot.
So it looks... new?

18:40.690 --> 18:43.122
I know the one.
My mom bought it for me.
I haven't worn it.

18:43.122 --> 18:46.856
- Oh. Must be a real winner.
- Pay, can you reach up here
and help me out?

18:46.856 --> 18:50.460
- Be careful with your back.
- My back is fine.

18:50.460 --> 18:54.404
I hope so. 'Cause, you know,
now that I've upped my degree
of difficulty on the beam,

18:54.404 --> 18:58.738
Sasha might send me first
to the roster for Nationals.
With you, uh, sidelined and all.

18:58.738 --> 19:03.243
I'm not sidelined. I'll be back
in the gym sticking it tomorrow
and I'll blow your beam away.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.845
- [scoffs] We'll see.
- Right on.

19:05.845 --> 19:10.350
- [Ronnie] Look who's here.
- I don't believe it.

19:10.350 --> 19:14.184
Summer made one of her
homemade lasagnas for the party.

19:14.184 --> 19:16.786
- I have two more dishes
in the car.
- Great.

19:16.786 --> 19:19.729
- Kaylie, Payson, will you help?
- Sure.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.734
What, are you stalking me?

19:24.734 --> 19:27.267
I came here
to get away from you.

19:27.267 --> 19:30.670
OK. I'm gonna bring this
in the kitchen.

19:34.344 --> 19:36.276
I'm not stalking you, Lauren.

19:36.276 --> 19:38.448
I came here to talk
to you about something.

19:38.448 --> 19:42.382
Oh. Let me guess.
Flowers for the wedding?

19:42.382 --> 19:43.953
I suggest poison ivy.

19:43.953 --> 19:47.517
I'm breaking off my
engagement to your father.

19:47.517 --> 19:51.691
If this is some sort of trick
to try get my sympathy,
it's not gonna work.

19:51.691 --> 19:55.265
It's not a trick, Lauren.
And this isn't easy for me.

19:55.265 --> 19:59.369
- I'm proud of what I do
for you and your father.
- You get paid for it.

19:59.369 --> 20:03.533
- It's your job.
- It's more than a job to me.
I love it.

20:03.533 --> 20:07.577
I love picking out
your birthday gifts,
organizing your schedules.

20:07.577 --> 20:12.482
But no matter how hard
I try to make you happy,
you just push me away.

20:12.482 --> 20:15.685
- Because I don't need you
to make me happy.
- I know that's how you feel.

20:15.685 --> 20:19.249
You don't know anything
about the way I feel.

20:19.249 --> 20:23.323
I know what it feels like when
your father seems to be choosing
his own needs over yours.

20:23.323 --> 20:28.628
Because that's what my father
did when he left my mother
to go find himself in Hawaii

20:28.628 --> 20:32.001
- with a neighbor of ours.
- You're making that up.

20:32.001 --> 20:39.439
I wish I were. Maybe that's
why I am working so hard
to prove myself to you.

20:39.439 --> 20:44.474
I look at your life, Lauren,
and sometimes it seems
like no one is on your side.

20:44.474 --> 20:49.719
I want to show you that I am.
And I'm gonna prove it
by walking away.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.383
Because that's what you want,
isn't it?

20:56.326 --> 20:58.528
OK. I'll take that as a yes.

21:00.490 --> 21:02.792
But if you ever need a friend,

21:02.792 --> 21:05.795
I promise you, Lauren,
you have one in me.

21:05.795 --> 21:08.037
Thanks, but I have
plenty of friends.

21:09.739 --> 21:11.871
I'm glad to hear that.

21:11.871 --> 21:14.444
- Good luck at Nationals.
- Thanks.

21:14.444 --> 21:16.376
Good luck with
the rest of your life.

21:30.490 --> 21:32.892
[indistinct chatter]

21:35.565 --> 21:37.727
- Lauren. Sh, sh, sh.
- Hi, Mr. Cruz.

21:37.727 --> 21:40.029
I want to show you something.

21:42.672 --> 21:44.874
- [gasps] It's beautiful.
- It's for Kaylie.

21:44.874 --> 21:47.006
It's a pre-Nationals present.

21:47.006 --> 21:50.510
I took the diamonds out
of my ring and
had them set into this heart.

21:50.510 --> 21:52.782
- Think she'll like it?
- I think she'll love it.

21:52.782 --> 21:55.044
When should I give it to her?
During the party?

21:55.044 --> 21:59.719
Definitely during the party
so everyone can see when she
replaces that cheapie one

21:59.719 --> 22:03.493
- she's been wearing
with this gorgeous one.
- Yeah, that's better.

22:03.493 --> 22:05.855
I'll give it to her
after the pep speech.
Thanks, Lauren.

22:05.855 --> 22:07.497
Mm-hm.

22:15.765 --> 22:18.668
- Hi.
- Hi! I brought
my famous deviled eggs.

22:18.668 --> 22:22.642
- Oh? What makes them famous?
- It's a family secret.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.714
- Spray cheese.
- Emily!

22:24.714 --> 22:27.346
Oh. Yummy!

22:32.622 --> 22:35.755
Oh, no! Summer's lasagna!

22:35.755 --> 22:38.458
[all screaming]

22:39.729 --> 22:43.893
Three trays,
and they're ruined!

22:44.864 --> 22:46.536
What am I gonna do?!

22:46.536 --> 22:49.839
OK. Emily, why don't you go
find the other girls.

22:49.839 --> 22:52.672
OK. Just take a deep breath,
and we'll figure this out.

22:52.672 --> 22:54.674
It's gonna be OK. Breathe.

22:54.674 --> 22:59.148
No. I'm... I'm this
terrible wife
and this horrible mother.

22:59.148 --> 23:02.011
- I can't do anything right!
- Yeah. Tell me about it.

23:02.952 --> 23:05.755
Oh! No. Not you, me.

23:05.755 --> 23:09.689
Except for the terrible
wife part, although
I've been there, done that.

23:09.689 --> 23:13.162
We need a drink.
Wine or vodka?

23:13.993 --> 23:15.625
[both] Vodka.

23:22.702 --> 23:26.736
- You look gorgeous.
- Thanks.

23:26.736 --> 23:28.538
Oh, did you mean her?

23:28.538 --> 23:32.682
You look pretty hot yourself.

23:32.682 --> 23:35.585
You know what? I'm gonna
go grab some of those
turkey roll-ups.

23:35.585 --> 23:38.848
No! You can't go!
You gotta help us cover!

23:38.848 --> 23:41.190
Us three out here
looks like one thing.

23:41.190 --> 23:44.053
Just Carter and I
looks like another.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.025
Great.

23:48.758 --> 23:51.961
- I miss you so much.
- I miss you too.

23:51.961 --> 23:54.433
I just wanna
kiss you right here.

23:54.433 --> 23:58.037
Speaking of kissing Carter...

23:58.037 --> 24:02.542
- Remember when we kissed?
- What are you talking about?

24:03.442 --> 24:04.714
You haven't forgotten?

24:09.919 --> 24:12.752
- Gymnastics camp,
Truth or Dare.
- Oh, my God! That's right!

24:12.752 --> 24:16.686
- You kissed her on a dare,
remember? We were, like, 12.
- Thirteen and a half.

24:16.686 --> 24:20.129
- Yeah.
- You were my first.

24:20.129 --> 24:23.693
- Kiss, that is.
- She had a huge crush on you.

24:23.693 --> 24:25.064
- Mm.
- I never told you that.

24:25.064 --> 24:28.638
Please, it was so obvious.
Every time you walked by,

24:28.638 --> 24:29.639
she got all

24:29.639 --> 24:31.801
sweaty and flustered.

24:31.801 --> 24:34.544
That explains
why you went after him.
Because I liked him.

24:34.544 --> 24:39.148
Uh, we were kids. I thought
you were over him by now.

24:39.148 --> 24:43.182
Oh, I am. I was.
I was never that into him.

24:43.182 --> 24:46.185
[laughs] Well,
all's fair in love and war.

24:47.757 --> 24:48.818
True.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.891
Kaylie! Oh. There you are.

24:51.891 --> 24:54.824
- Hey, Dad.
- Come on, there's
someone I want you to meet.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.873
- What the hell are you doing?
- What are you doing?

25:03.873 --> 25:08.507
Acting like the wonderful
boyfriend who, oh yeah,
slept with Kaylie's best friend.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.740
- Oopsies.
- I know you want
to break me and Kaylie up,

25:10.740 --> 25:13.042
but it's not
going to happen.

25:14.714 --> 25:16.916
I'm just trying to help you
do the right thing, Carter.

25:24.223 --> 25:29.759
- Oh, hey, Mike.
- Kim Keeler and Sasha.

25:29.759 --> 25:33.703
- No way!
- Mark is away.

25:33.703 --> 25:37.236
- If Sasha were gonna
hook up with a gym mom...
- It would be you?

25:38.838 --> 25:40.009
- Kim!
- Sasha!

25:40.009 --> 25:42.712
- Hey, ladies.
- Hi!

25:42.712 --> 25:45.114
- Hi.
- Kim. How's Mark?

25:45.114 --> 25:47.046
He's good. He's sorry
he can't be here.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.779
I understand.
Tough times.

25:49.779 --> 25:54.083
Well, not for some people whose
mansion shall remain nameless.

25:54.083 --> 25:57.056
- [nervous laughter]
- Kim, have you seen Payson?

25:57.056 --> 26:00.760
- She looks adorable
in Kaylie's dress.
- Kaylie's dress?

26:00.760 --> 26:04.033
Yeah, Kaylie loaned her
this darling little number
I bought last year.

26:04.033 --> 26:06.636
Really? Where is Payson?

26:06.636 --> 26:10.099
I think all the girls
are out on the patio.
Follow me.

26:10.099 --> 26:12.742
- Excuse me.
- See you.

26:12.742 --> 26:15.274
- So... [laughs]
- So...

26:15.274 --> 26:17.677
- Mrs. Keeler?
- Mm.

26:17.677 --> 26:21.951
I got your number.
You're the sexy but aloof coach

26:21.951 --> 26:24.954
who flirts with all the gym
moms, but he's off-limits.

26:24.954 --> 26:28.057
Makes him feel strong
and in control. Am I right?

26:29.258 --> 26:31.961
I should go mingle.
Excuse me.

26:34.824 --> 26:36.896
- What was that?
- Oh...

26:36.896 --> 26:40.830
- Nothing. I need a refill.
- What is going on?

26:40.830 --> 26:45.134
You only drink
when you're stressed out.
It's money, isn't it?

26:45.134 --> 26:48.738
No. We're fine. Now.

26:48.738 --> 26:52.011
Now? Mom?

26:52.011 --> 26:55.715
- I had to borrow a little.
- How much is a little?

26:55.715 --> 26:58.888
- A few thousand.
- A few thousand dollars?

26:58.888 --> 27:02.291
- From who?
- It doesn't matter who.
The point is I took care of us.

27:02.291 --> 27:04.694
Who did you borrow a few
thousand dollars from?

27:04.694 --> 27:07.356
OK. Fine. Joe.

27:08.057 --> 27:10.700
Joe?! Are you crazy?!

27:10.700 --> 27:12.802
We moved to Fresno
to get away from Joe.

27:12.802 --> 27:16.806
We needed money, and the truth
is the salon's been dead.
I had nowhere else to turn.

27:16.806 --> 27:19.739
- You swore
you were done with him!
- I am! He's not coming back.

27:19.739 --> 27:25.014
He just wired us the money
so you can go to Nationals.

27:25.014 --> 27:28.647
I wanted to believe you
when you told me not to worry,
even though I knew better.

27:28.647 --> 27:33.182
I wanted, so badly,
for you to just come through.
Just this once.

28:21.931 --> 28:24.273
[indistinct chatter]

28:25.875 --> 28:28.437
- Hey, Keeler.
- Oh, hey.

28:28.437 --> 28:32.241
Wow. Uh... I've never
seen you in a dress.

28:32.241 --> 28:35.344
- You look amazing.
- Look, I have the money.

28:35.344 --> 28:38.047
I don't think
we should do it here.
I don't want my mom to see.

28:38.047 --> 28:40.820
Why am I starting
to feel like your drug dealer?

28:40.820 --> 28:44.894
We're not talking heroin here.
It's just cortisone.
It's totally legal.

28:44.894 --> 28:48.227
I know, it's just...
I feel so weird,

28:48.227 --> 28:51.030
lying to her about it.
It's crazy.

28:51.030 --> 28:54.063
Kids lie to
parents about doing drugs.
I hate that I have to do either.

28:54.063 --> 28:57.166
Um, speaking of your mom...
Incoming.

28:57.166 --> 28:58.838
- There you are.
- Hey.

28:58.838 --> 29:00.509
- Hi.
- You know Nick.

29:00.509 --> 29:03.172
Well, I should, I've been making
travel arrangements for him

29:03.172 --> 29:08.317
- and the rest of you all day.
- Yeah. And we really appreciate
all the hard work, Mrs. Keeler.

29:08.317 --> 29:09.779
- Thank you, Nick.
- Go Rock.

29:09.779 --> 29:11.821
Yeah, go Rock.

29:11.821 --> 29:16.355
- That dress looks
adorable on you.
- Oh, thanks. It was on sale.

29:16.355 --> 29:21.831
Nice of Kaylie
to mark it down. Payson,
what is going on with you?

29:21.831 --> 29:24.994
First you lie to Sasha about
how much cortisone you've had,

29:24.994 --> 29:29.899
and now you're trying to lie
to me about buying a dress?
It's just not you.

29:29.899 --> 29:33.903
- Is it your dad? Nationals?
- I lost it.

29:33.903 --> 29:38.347
- What?
- The money you gave me
for the dress. I lost it.

29:38.347 --> 29:40.950
I put it in my gym bag
and it must have fallen out.

29:40.950 --> 29:44.854
I know how tight things are
and I didn't want you to worry,
so I borrowed a dress.

29:44.854 --> 29:49.188
I am upset. A hundred dollars
is a lot of money.

29:49.188 --> 29:53.823
But I'm more upset that
you tried to lie to me about it.

29:53.823 --> 29:55.464
Our family's
always been honest.

29:55.464 --> 29:57.897
Like dad was honest
about losing his job?

29:57.897 --> 30:01.800
- He was trying to protect us.
- I can understand that.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.933
- He did what
he thought he had to do.
- Yes.

30:03.933 --> 30:07.476
But he's an adult
and you are a teenager.

30:07.476 --> 30:12.011
So promise me,
from now on, no matter what,
you'll tell me the truth.

30:12.011 --> 30:13.943
I promise.

30:13.943 --> 30:16.085
There's the girl
I've been looking for.

30:16.085 --> 30:18.217
- I want to talk to you about...
- My back is fine.

30:18.217 --> 30:21.490
Good. That's why
I made you sit out practice.

30:21.490 --> 30:23.893
I need you in top form
for Nationals.

30:23.893 --> 30:26.595
- I'm ranking you
as our number one.
- You are?

30:26.595 --> 30:29.999
There was never any doubt.
You manage your pain
and don't psyche yourself out,

30:29.999 --> 30:32.932
- you can win the
all-around gold in Boston.
- Thank you!

30:32.932 --> 30:36.205
And I promise,
I won't let you down!

30:36.205 --> 30:37.466
I know.

30:41.510 --> 30:44.343
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

30:44.343 --> 30:46.415
- I'm...
- You can't keep doing this!

30:46.415 --> 30:48.918
- Doing what?
- Showing up where you want!

30:48.918 --> 30:51.280
This is not
a kegger you can crash!

30:51.280 --> 30:56.926
This is a private party!
And the gym is not high school,
it's work.

30:56.926 --> 30:59.288
I appreciate that you
helped me sneak into The Rock,

30:59.288 --> 31:02.231
that doesn't mean
you can break into my life
when you feel like it!

31:02.231 --> 31:04.033
There you are.

31:05.935 --> 31:07.396
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

31:07.396 --> 31:09.038
No. Thank you
for being so quick.

31:09.038 --> 31:11.240
You really saved the day.

31:14.443 --> 31:18.647
- Oh, my God, you...
- I was not stalking you.

31:18.647 --> 31:21.180
- Just delivering pizzas.
- I'm so sorry.

31:21.180 --> 31:24.583
Save it. I couldn't break
into your life if I wanted to.

31:24.583 --> 31:27.886
And good luck at Nationals.

31:27.886 --> 31:31.460
I hope you get everything
you ever wanted.

31:31.460 --> 31:33.092
And I hope it's enough.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.906
Don't you think
you've had enough?

31:49.638 --> 31:51.540
Emily hates me.

31:51.540 --> 31:54.643
And you think having
another martini will
make her like you again?

31:55.644 --> 31:57.646
No.

31:57.646 --> 32:00.589
But it might
make me hate myself less.

32:01.690 --> 32:03.692
Why don't we
get you home.

32:03.692 --> 32:05.454
Let Emily enjoy
the rest the party.

32:07.656 --> 32:12.001
Then maybe
you and I can enjoy...

32:13.362 --> 32:14.703
A pot of coffee.

32:14.703 --> 32:17.006
- [laughs]
- You're no fun.

32:17.006 --> 32:20.609
- Come on.
- Yeah.

32:27.676 --> 32:29.548
So, what,
you don't like parties?

32:29.548 --> 32:32.721
[laughs] No, I just...

32:32.721 --> 32:35.954
I don't like a mandatory
waste of time four days
before Nationals.

32:36.725 --> 32:39.028
You know,
I'd rather be training.

32:39.028 --> 32:44.163
Amen to that.
So guess what?

32:44.163 --> 32:47.466
- I'm going as the top girl
for The Rock.
- Duh.

32:47.466 --> 32:50.139
- [both laugh]
- I could have told you that.

32:50.139 --> 32:54.643
You're better than anyone,
and after Nationals,
you're gonna be number one.

32:57.346 --> 32:59.978
So, what about this?

33:03.652 --> 33:06.055
Sasha said I need
to manage my pain.

33:06.055 --> 33:08.987
Yeah. It's up to you.

33:13.762 --> 33:16.565
No, I can't take your money.

33:16.565 --> 33:18.597
- But you said...
- I lied.

33:18.597 --> 33:22.371
I'll tell you what.
We'll just compare
gold medals at Nationals.

33:22.371 --> 33:25.734
And I expect at least one
dance at the party after.

33:25.734 --> 33:31.140
Uh... [laughs]
Maybe even a slow one.

33:37.146 --> 33:40.249
[clears throat] Baby. Can you
gather everyone for my speech?

33:40.249 --> 33:43.722
- I have to run upstairs
and grab Kaylie's gift.
- OK, sure.

33:46.625 --> 33:51.300
Hey, Kaylie, mind if I borrow
your cell real fast? Mine's
dead. I gotta call my dad.

33:51.300 --> 33:53.262
Yeah. Sure.
It's on my dresser.

34:00.669 --> 34:02.641
[phone rings]

34:16.054 --> 34:17.686
[Alex] Hello?

34:27.696 --> 34:32.171
- [laughing]
- Honey, your father
is about to make his speech.

34:32.171 --> 34:34.143
- Will you help
me gather everyone?
- Sure.

34:34.143 --> 34:38.347
Everyone, if you could
gather round, Alex would
like to say a few words.

34:38.347 --> 34:42.151
- Oh, here he is. Alex?
- What is this?

34:42.751 --> 34:45.114
- I don't know.
- This?

34:45.114 --> 34:48.187
- What is this?
- OK. I can explain...

34:48.187 --> 34:49.718
I don't think you can.

34:51.560 --> 34:52.561
[Kaylie] Dad...

34:53.862 --> 34:56.425
- I love him.
- Love?

34:56.425 --> 34:59.628
You're 16 years old, Kaylie.
What do you know about love?

34:59.628 --> 35:02.831
- Alex, don't.
- How could you sneak
around behind my back

35:02.831 --> 35:07.576
and risk everything
we've worked so hard for?
Everything!

35:07.576 --> 35:10.409
- You don't understand.
- I understand you lied to me.

35:10.409 --> 35:13.742
I thought we we're honest
with each other.
I thought we were a team.

35:13.742 --> 35:18.317
- Mr. Cruz...
- You stay the hell out of this!

35:18.317 --> 35:20.549
- We haven't done
anything wrong.
- Give me a break.

35:20.549 --> 35:23.452
- I used to be a teenage boy.
- All she wants
is to please you.

35:23.452 --> 35:27.796
- That's why she didn't tell.
- Don't talk to me
about my daughter.

35:27.796 --> 35:30.128
Somebody needs to.
You don't even know her.

35:30.128 --> 35:32.661
- I know my daughter.
- Really?

35:32.661 --> 35:35.704
- Mm-hm.
- Who's her
favorite singer? Huh?

35:35.704 --> 35:39.638
What's her favorite movie?
Name it! You can't, can you?

35:39.638 --> 35:42.541
Never Been Kissed.
Second favorite?
The Little Mermaid.

35:42.541 --> 35:44.743
You wouldn't know.
All you know about Kaylie

35:44.743 --> 35:47.916
is her degree of difficulty.
She's another trophy
to put on your mantle.

35:47.916 --> 35:50.249
- Hey, listen!
- Don't touch me! [grunts]

35:50.249 --> 35:51.680
- Carter! No!
- Alex!

35:51.680 --> 35:54.853
You get the hell
out of my house!

35:54.853 --> 35:56.585
- Just go.
- Now!

35:56.585 --> 35:58.857
Go! Leave. Go.

36:09.898 --> 36:12.701
Carter.

36:12.701 --> 36:15.274
Carter, wait.

36:15.274 --> 36:18.477
- Take me with you!
- Are you crazy?

36:18.477 --> 36:21.510
Do you think I'm stupid?
How did Alex Cruz get my phone?

36:21.510 --> 36:25.754
Hm? You took it that night at
the kegger to give to
Kaylie's dad to break us up!

36:25.754 --> 36:28.757
That's not true.
No! I love you!

36:28.757 --> 36:32.521
You're a liar.
And you're pathetic.

36:32.521 --> 36:36.365
And I will never be with you.
You disgust me.

36:48.206 --> 36:51.240
So thank you for
getting me out of there

36:51.240 --> 36:53.642
before I really
made a fool of myself.

36:53.642 --> 36:56.645
I've played the fool before.
More times than I care to admit.

36:59.318 --> 37:02.651
Really?
You always seem so in control.

37:04.523 --> 37:06.595
I'm a good actor.

37:06.595 --> 37:10.799
- [laughs]
- So why do you
think Emily hates you?

37:10.799 --> 37:15.003
Because I'm a lousy mother.

37:15.003 --> 37:17.806
I haven't noticed that. You
always seem so devoted to her.

37:17.806 --> 37:20.809
Even when I'm trying
to help her, I feel like
I'm letting her down.

37:20.809 --> 37:24.713
- For example?
- I called an old boyfriend

37:24.713 --> 37:26.815
to borrow some money.

37:26.815 --> 37:31.520
An old boyfriend I promised
I'd never talk to again.

37:31.520 --> 37:35.784
- Is he a problem?
- For my ego, and my pride.

37:37.286 --> 37:38.757
Emily will never
forgive him for that.

37:38.757 --> 37:43.732
But... he lives in California
and we live here.

37:43.732 --> 37:47.296
I just...

37:47.296 --> 37:51.269
To get us through Nationals,
you know? I did it for Emily.

37:51.269 --> 37:54.643
I'm sure
she'll realize that.

37:54.643 --> 37:58.747
And hey, if this ex
becomes a problem,

37:58.747 --> 38:00.849
he's got me
to contend with.

38:05.384 --> 38:06.955
I should probably go.

38:10.489 --> 38:12.791
Sasha.

38:12.791 --> 38:16.965
If you were gonna
go for one of the gym moms...

38:16.965 --> 38:19.728
You know, if it wasn't
against the rules
and everything,

38:19.728 --> 38:24.733
- do you think that... maybe...
- You. Hands down.

38:26.335 --> 38:28.737
[laughs] You really
are a bad actor.

38:28.737 --> 38:32.511
- [laughs]
- But thank you
for saying that. I...

38:32.511 --> 38:34.082
I needed it.

38:45.854 --> 38:47.856
[phone rings]

38:51.900 --> 38:53.662
Hello?

38:54.863 --> 38:57.666
Joe? I told you not to call me.

38:57.666 --> 39:00.869
What? He's coach! Wha...?

39:00.869 --> 39:02.671
What a minute.
Where are you?

39:02.671 --> 39:04.843
[knocking]

39:07.576 --> 39:08.747
Great.

39:13.382 --> 39:16.385
[door opens, closes]

39:20.529 --> 39:24.763
You know, you can't just show up
whenever you feel like it.
This is where I work.

39:24.763 --> 39:27.596
[scoffs] OK,
I deserved that.

39:27.596 --> 39:30.969
But if you think that you
don't make friends easily,

39:30.969 --> 39:33.672
you're looking at
a girl who has no friends.

39:33.672 --> 39:36.745
- What about the girls
at The Rock?
- It's complicated.

39:38.046 --> 39:42.380
I'm so focused on Nationals
that I don't know

39:42.380 --> 39:45.083
what I'm supposed to feel,
or if I'm even allowed to feel.

39:46.685 --> 39:48.757
But...

39:48.757 --> 39:51.620
...I can't seem to stay
away from you either.

39:51.620 --> 39:53.792
I can't believe
I finally found someone who...

39:56.465 --> 40:00.729
And then, now that I have,
I can't...

40:02.431 --> 40:04.603
Say it, Emily.

40:04.603 --> 40:08.637
You can't believe
you met somebody who
really understands you.

40:08.637 --> 40:11.440
And then, when you did,

40:11.440 --> 40:12.881
you can't even be together.

40:13.982 --> 40:18.146
Ugh. I feel like we're
trapped in a Coldplay song.

40:18.146 --> 40:22.651
Which is its own level
in Dante's hell.

40:22.651 --> 40:27.025
- Who's Dante?
- You haven't been cranking
on the home-schooling much.

40:27.025 --> 40:28.597
[laughs]

40:29.958 --> 40:34.162
Look, I'm sorry
my life is so...

40:35.063 --> 40:38.066
- Complicated.
- Yeah.

40:38.066 --> 40:39.167
Comp...

40:41.470 --> 40:43.071
Emily, it's not
just your life.

40:45.874 --> 40:47.776
I have news.

40:47.776 --> 40:51.219
I was gonna wait
to tell you, but...

40:51.219 --> 40:53.752
I sent some songs
to a producer in LA,

40:53.752 --> 40:55.824
and he has a band
that wants to record them.

40:57.786 --> 41:01.930
That's amazing!
Why don't you want
to record them?

41:01.930 --> 41:04.593
'Cause I'm not as brave as you.

41:05.794 --> 41:09.167
Anyway, they
sent me a ticket to LA.

41:09.167 --> 41:14.803
- I leave next week.
- For how long?

41:16.705 --> 41:20.148
I thought I'd check out
the scene for a while.

41:20.148 --> 41:24.553
You have your competitions
coming up and I don't want
to be in your way.

41:31.860 --> 41:34.022
I can't believe
you're leaving Boulder.

41:36.825 --> 41:38.927
I think it might
be easier this way.

41:40.228 --> 41:42.531
Why doesn't it feel easier?

41:48.737 --> 41:51.710
[soft rock plays]

41:55.884 --> 41:59.247
- Kaylie? Sweetheart?
- Go away!

42:01.990 --> 42:07.956
I know you feel
like your world is crashing
and burning right now.

42:07.956 --> 42:11.259
But your dad will
calm down, you'll go to
Nationals and do great,

42:11.259 --> 42:14.963
and there will be a time,
someday sooner than you think,

42:14.963 --> 42:19.537
when you can be with Carter
or whoever you want to be with.

42:19.537 --> 42:21.740
You don't understand.

42:21.740 --> 42:25.944
Me and Carter...
we love each other.

42:25.944 --> 42:29.217
And we want
to be together forever.

42:29.217 --> 42:33.181
And not someday. Now.

42:33.181 --> 42:36.585
I understand.
You're in love.

42:36.585 --> 42:39.788
And I think that's wonderful.

42:39.788 --> 42:43.992
But you're awfully young
to know what you want forever.

42:43.992 --> 42:46.935
You were barely my age
when you met Dad.

42:46.935 --> 42:51.139
Although, I guess you don't love
him as much as I love Carter.

You have every reason
to be angry with me, Kaylie.

43:04.983 --> 43:08.857
I've let you down
in a lot of ways.

43:08.857 --> 43:13.191
But I'm human, and sometimes
even mothers make mistakes.

43:15.964 --> 43:20.799
I hope that you can
understand or even...

43:20.799 --> 43:23.772
...forgive me someday.

43:25.734 --> 43:27.235
I really hope so.

43:51.099 --> 43:54.763
- Lauren?
- I need someone to talk to.

43:54.763 --> 43:59.808
- What's wrong?
- Everything! [sobbing]

43:59.808 --> 44:01.740
Everything!

44:01.740 --> 44:03.742
