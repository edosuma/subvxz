Hi, Oscar, I'm Sea Susie,
the sea witch.

05:04.001 --> 05:06.018
Oh, that explains why
the sea bunnies freaked out.

05:06.020 --> 05:10.001
They didn't know I was
talking about "Land Susie".

05:10.003 --> 05:13.003
Who, admittedly,
is also scary.

05:13.005 --> 05:15.006
Land Susie?
She sounds cool.

05:15.008 --> 05:16.016
Why'd you zap
those SB's?

05:16.018 --> 05:18.014
I needed them.
Those weren't Sea Bunnies.

05:18.016 --> 05:20.000
They were Sea "Rabbits".

05:20.002 --> 05:22.001
You actually fell
for their little song?

05:23.018 --> 05:25.013
I know
that facial expression.

05:25.015 --> 05:26.012
You're hungry.

05:26.014 --> 05:28.004
Here, have a sea cucumber.

05:31.020 --> 05:33.005
Mmm.

05:34.020 --> 05:36.022
This is tasty tasty!

05:37.000 --> 05:38.012
Did you put a spell
on this cuke?

05:38.014 --> 05:40.012
Just a pinch
of sea salt.

05:40.014 --> 05:41.021
Oscar, you're hooked!

05:43.008 --> 05:44.019
You can say that again!

No, you're <i>hooked.</i>

05:48.008 --> 05:50.014

I'm Oscar.

05:54.004 --> 05:57.003
Oh, yeah.

06:01.018 --> 06:04.020
Osc, my man, do you need
a lift back to shore?

06:04.022 --> 06:06.013
Reel me in, captain!

06:06.015 --> 06:08.000
You showed up
just in time.

06:08.002 --> 06:09.014
We're about
to call it quits.

06:09.016 --> 06:11.005
If you don't mind me
asking,

06:11.007 --> 06:13.015
what are you gonna do
with all those sea bunnies?

06:13.017 --> 06:15.016
Oh my!
Thanks for reminding us.

06:15.018 --> 06:17.021
We almost forgot to dump them
back in the ocean.

06:17.023 --> 06:20.005
This is a catch-and-release
ship, after all.

06:20.007 --> 06:22.017
It's the only ethical way
to get the thrill of fishing.

06:22.019 --> 06:23.023
Hold on now!

06:24.001 --> 06:25.021
Can't we take one back
with us for Susie?

06:25.023 --> 06:28.005
Oscar, you're not
trying to get us

06:28.007 --> 06:30.015
to budge on our ethics,
are you?

06:30.017 --> 06:32.017
Uh,
it's international waters.

06:32.019 --> 06:34.017
Anything goes!

06:37.005 --> 06:39.019
No!

06:39.021 --> 06:42.007
Ethically speaking,
we caught Oscar.

06:42.009 --> 06:44.023
We should probably dump him
back in the ocean now too!

06:45.001 --> 06:46.017
I was contemplating that,

06:46.019 --> 06:49.015
but what of Oscar's
own volition in this situation?

06:49.017 --> 06:50.023
Does his agency as a captive

06:51.001 --> 06:54.006
override our obligations
as seafarers?

06:54.008 --> 06:57.019
A quandary.
A true quandary.

I'll save you
the trouble.

I felt so worthless ♪

10:48.012 --> 10:55.017
