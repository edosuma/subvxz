14:59.099 --> 15:00.298
Oh.

15:00.799 --> 15:01.966
(GRUNTS)

15:03.669 --> 15:05.403
Now I understand.

15:06.839 --> 15:08.740
THOR: Hulk, take
the ones on the left.

15:08.742 --> 15:11.075
HULK: And you get
the one on the right.

15:11.077 --> 15:13.077
(HULK GRUNTING)

15:13.079 --> 15:14.345
Hulk? Thor?

15:14.347 --> 15:16.281
You ever see anything
like this?

15:16.283 --> 15:19.083
That's a big gun.

15:19.085 --> 15:22.587
You weren't looking for
anything in particular
at my armory.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.422
You were just in awe,

15:24.424 --> 15:27.292
like a savage seeing
his first hologram,

15:27.294 --> 15:30.795
or an Orakulan
encountering a beta field.

15:30.797 --> 15:32.931
A what?
My mistake.

15:32.933 --> 15:36.734
That reference
won't make sense
for another 800 years.

15:36.736 --> 15:38.736
Not that you will be
around for that.

15:38.738 --> 15:39.938
You never know.

15:39.940 --> 15:42.373
I might have an upgrade
or two up my sleeve.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.985
Typical of the primitive mind.

15:53.987 --> 15:58.323
Never convinced until it sees
a demonstration of power.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.758
(RUMBLING)

16:00.760 --> 16:01.993
(GRUNTS)

16:01.995 --> 16:02.961
What did you do?

16:02.963 --> 16:05.029
HAWKEYE: We're turning.
(ALL GROANING)

16:06.332 --> 16:08.533
And I don't like
the direction!

16:17.576 --> 16:20.378
He means to destroy
the isle of Manhattan.

16:21.246 --> 16:23.014
Not on my watch!

16:23.016 --> 16:25.083
(GROANS)

16:26.318 --> 16:28.152
(GROANS)

16:30.122 --> 16:32.023
AIM AGENT:
All I did was ask him
about storybooks,

16:32.025 --> 16:33.491
and he gets all mad
at me. Huh?

16:33.493 --> 16:35.059
(GRUNTING)

16:40.833 --> 16:42.433
BLACK WIDOW:
Falcon, drive the ship.

16:42.435 --> 16:43.868
Hold it!

16:44.336 --> 16:46.104
(SHIELD WHOOSHING)

16:47.172 --> 16:48.306
(WINCING)

16:48.308 --> 16:51.876
Guess it wants to see
my driver's license.

16:51.878 --> 16:53.811
You control this thing
with your mind?

16:53.813 --> 16:57.115
You'd have me use switches,
dials, or levers.

16:57.117 --> 17:00.284
In my world they're
as obsolete as you are.

17:00.286 --> 17:01.953
Obsolete.

17:01.955 --> 17:03.888
It's why there's no security
in my line of work.

17:03.890 --> 17:07.157
Every brilliant new invention
gets replaced sooner or later.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.694
And so do the inventors.
Don't we?

17:09.695 --> 17:12.030
What do you mean "we"?

17:12.031 --> 17:15.032
You think I'd open up
like this to just anyone?

17:15.035 --> 17:17.234
Had to be a guy who
knows what it's like,

17:17.237 --> 17:20.371
always worrying
that you're about to lose
everything you've worked for.

17:20.373 --> 17:24.976
Conquerors don't worry
about anything.

17:24.978 --> 17:28.012
You call this ship
the <i> Sword of Damocles,</i>
don't you?

17:28.013 --> 17:29.247
You know what that was?

17:29.249 --> 17:32.050
A king's sword.
Suspended by a single hair.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.185
Always ready to fall.

17:34.187 --> 17:37.055
IRON MAN: And any minute,
he could lose
his whole kingdom.

17:37.057 --> 17:39.824
You sure picked the right name
for this thing.

17:39.826 --> 17:43.161
No one is ever going
to usurp me.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.062
No one.

17:44.064 --> 17:45.997
You sound just like me.

17:45.999 --> 17:48.666
Hey, maybe I'm your
great-great-great-grandfather.

17:48.668 --> 17:50.101
What do you think,

17:50.103 --> 17:51.269
Junior?

17:51.670 --> 17:52.804
(GROWLS)

17:54.373 --> 17:56.908
(GROANS)

17:56.910 --> 17:58.976
Glad we had
this talk, sparky.

18:02.614 --> 18:06.117
This brainwave
receptor's how Kang
was controlling the ship.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.785
Something just
knocked it offline.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.520
Did it open up
a vulnerability?

18:09.522 --> 18:11.622
Might take a while, but...
(ZAPPING)

18:12.257 --> 18:14.125
We don't have a while.

18:15.527 --> 18:19.664
Okay, giant gun,
I still got one good arm.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.266
Oh, yeah!

18:36.782 --> 18:38.549
BLACK WIDOW: I know
what you're thinking.

18:38.551 --> 18:42.286
You're thinking any one
of these future gizmos
would keep you on top

18:42.288 --> 18:45.423
and get the competition
off your heels.

18:45.425 --> 18:48.459
And nobody would ever
know who you took it from.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.561
They'd think you came up
with it on your own.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.797
You imagine that my ego
could take credit

18:52.799 --> 18:54.265
for something
that wasn't mine?

18:54.267 --> 18:56.067
You tell me.

18:57.402 --> 18:59.237
How about I show you?

19:12.251 --> 19:13.851
Whoa!

19:16.088 --> 19:18.089
I set the ship
to self-destruct.

19:18.091 --> 19:19.290
Where are...
(GRUNTS)

19:19.292 --> 19:20.825
(GRUNTS)

19:23.996 --> 19:25.530
(GRUNTING)

19:26.632 --> 19:28.633
This is the last
of the big guns.

19:28.635 --> 19:32.436
And now that
New York is safe,
there's our exit plan.

19:32.871 --> 19:34.038
Or was.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.206
Where's Cap and Falcon?

19:35.208 --> 19:36.574
(RUMBLING)
(ALL GROAN)

19:38.810 --> 19:41.312
You Avengers
almost thwarted me.

19:41.314 --> 19:43.181
Well done.

19:43.183 --> 19:45.216
A pity you've run
out of time.

19:52.357 --> 19:57.428
As I said before,
"I have all the time
in the world."

20:00.065 --> 20:01.332
HAWKEYE: What is he doing?

20:01.334 --> 20:02.833
BLACK WIDOW:
He's headed for
a time portal.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.635
Not this day, he isn't.

20:06.138 --> 20:07.605
Kang!

20:08.373 --> 20:09.207
(GRUNTS)

20:09.209 --> 20:10.608
(ENERGY WHIRS)
What?

20:18.016 --> 20:19.217
Mjolnir!

20:22.387 --> 20:23.221
(GASPS)

20:24.089 --> 20:26.157
(THOR PANTING)

20:29.928 --> 20:31.395
To me!

20:31.730 --> 20:33.331
(GRUNTS)

20:36.935 --> 20:38.336
Wait, no!

21:07.199 --> 21:08.466
(GROANS)

21:09.368 --> 21:10.801
(BOTH GROAN)

21:10.803 --> 21:12.103
(GROWLS)

21:14.573 --> 21:16.874
My signals are all
coming back empty.

21:16.876 --> 21:19.443
I can't get a hold
of Friday or anyone.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.345
CAPTAIN AMERICA:
That's because

21:22.214 --> 21:24.181
this is the future, Tony.
