lam 16 years old.

02:08.251 --> 02:11.334
And I've never been to school.

02:11.334 --> 02:12.167
Produced by LEE EUGENE

02:12.167 --> 02:16.084
I spend most of my time reading books,

02:16.084 --> 02:16.709
directed by E J-YONG

02:16.709 --> 02:18.376
or writing on my computer.

02:21.042 --> 02:25.209
I began writing about my parents some time ago.

02:31.376 --> 02:33.542
"They looked into each other,"

02:33.542 --> 02:35.709
"and kissed without hesitation."

02:37.209 --> 02:42.459
Mom and dad had me when they were only 17.

02:46.376 --> 02:51.667
MY BRILLIANT LIFE

02:51.667 --> 02:54.876
Whoa, bravo.

02:57.876 --> 03:03.292
It's nothing to be ashamed of, nor proud of.

03:04.334 --> 03:06.251
Despite being only 17?

03:06.751 --> 03:10.626
Not 27, they were kids.

03:10.626 --> 03:16.876
Romeo and Juliet also fell in love at that age.

03:17.751 --> 03:22.417
Youths in love, I'm so jealous.

03:22.417 --> 03:25.584
Love in the spring, like a start
of their lives.

03:27.042 --> 03:29.834
I pity the youths today.

03:30.834 --> 03:33.501
Then again, they all do it too.

03:35.501 --> 03:40.376
I bet your dad freaked out when he found out.

03:47.251 --> 03:50.334
You won't...really have the baby?

03:50.667 --> 03:52.251
I don't know.

03:52.376 --> 03:54.917
You don't? Are you nuts?

03:56.376 --> 03:58.209
- Mira!
- What?

03:58.209 --> 03:59.501
I'm only 17!

03:59.667 --> 04:01.167
We're the same age.

04:01.334 --> 04:02.709
I really am stupid!

04:04.584 --> 04:07.792
My family is poor, and no future either.

04:08.209 --> 04:09.084
Oh yeah!

04:09.084 --> 04:11.459
I don't even have a mom to help raise the kid.

04:12.792 --> 04:16.416
If the word gets out,
we'll be high school dropouts!

04:16.416 --> 04:18.459
How can we raise a child?!

04:18.500 --> 04:19.750
My mom's a dropout too,

04:19.750 --> 04:20.459
but did fine.

04:20.500 --> 04:21.916
You call this fine?!

04:25.126 --> 04:26.792
If you have the baby...

04:27.167 --> 04:31.334
people will know we did it.

04:31.334 --> 04:32.501
You okay with that?

04:37.251 --> 04:39.126
- Dae-su.
- Yeah?

04:42.876 --> 04:45.084
There's a bug that disguises itself
as bird shit

04:45.084 --> 04:47.834
to survive.

04:48.376 --> 04:49.501
So what?

04:49.709 --> 04:53.626
You look pathetic like that bug.

04:54.459 --> 04:56.834
Choi Mira, my mom.

04:57.126 --> 05:01.251
Youngest of 6 siblings, with 5 brothers.

05:02.001 --> 05:04.542
And my dad impregnated her.

05:04.542 --> 05:07.084
- Stop right there!
- Why's he so fast?!

05:07.417 --> 05:08.584
Motherfucker!

05:08.584 --> 05:10.626
I'll fucking whip your ass!

05:10.626 --> 05:12.834
Screw you! I'm not that stupid!

05:13.042 --> 05:15.001
You're so fucking dead!

05:17.376 --> 05:18.542
Get over here!

05:18.542 --> 05:20.917
We sent you to school to study!

05:21.209 --> 05:24.584
You're pregnant?! Let go of me!

05:24.584 --> 05:25.917
Come here!

05:27.501 --> 05:28.584
Get over here!

05:28.584 --> 05:31.376
- Please stop!
- Out of my way!

05:33.167 --> 05:34.417
Ow!

05:34.417 --> 05:35.834
Shit!

05:35.834 --> 05:38.167
Her nickname as a kid was 'Shit Princess'.

05:39.751 --> 05:43.667
It's all thanks to my uncles' early education.

05:43.667 --> 05:45.001
Shit!

05:45.001 --> 05:47.667
You had big bro when you were 17 too!

05:48.084 --> 05:49.626
But that was...

05:50.084 --> 05:52.209
Who's the father?! Tell me!

05:54.376 --> 05:55.167
Say what?!

05:55.376 --> 05:56.251
First warning!

05:58.542 --> 06:01.251
He was out of bounds,
why am I getting a warning?!

06:02.167 --> 06:03.501
You took bribes again?!

06:03.501 --> 06:04.792
Shut the hell up!

06:05.209 --> 06:05.959
Blue, out!

06:06.417 --> 06:08.251
What?! Look at this blind fuck!

06:08.584 --> 06:09.584
Dae-su, stop!

06:09.584 --> 06:10.751
Let go!

06:10.751 --> 06:12.459
My dad, Han Dae-su.

06:12.709 --> 06:15.334
Former taekwondo athlete and...

06:17.501 --> 06:21.459
he became infamous in his town
for swing kicking his principal.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.001
Son of bitch!

06:25.334 --> 06:27.667
I didn't teach you,

06:27.917 --> 06:29.876
swing kick for that purpose!

06:32.251 --> 06:33.126
You idiot!

06:33.876 --> 06:35.709
What? "Pregnant"?

06:37.376 --> 06:39.042
<i>L</i> quit!

06:40.084 --> 06:42.792
School, and you too! I don't need anything!

06:42.917 --> 06:43.792
Say what?

06:45.084 --> 06:46.167
Boy!

06:46.459 --> 06:48.084
Get back here!

06:49.709 --> 06:51.917
I'll never ever come back!

06:53.251 --> 06:56.542
Dad left home that day,

06:57.292 --> 06:59.376
and never went back.

07:04.376 --> 07:05.084
Ahreum!

07:06.126 --> 07:08.251
Mom, knock!

07:14.459 --> 07:15.792
Yes, come in.

07:17.417 --> 07:18.542
Happy?

07:21.251 --> 07:23.167
Don't wear hat inside.

07:23.167 --> 07:24.667
Forget it.

07:25.751 --> 07:27.709
- Took blood pressure pills?
- Yes.

07:27.709 --> 07:30.167
Rheumatic pills?
- I took them.

07:30.167 --> 07:31.417
Stomach pills?

07:31.459 --> 07:35.167
Mom, I'm used to it. I can take care of myself.

07:35.209 --> 07:37.001
Any insulin shots left?

07:37.001 --> 07:38.959
Enough for 2.

07:39.834 --> 07:43.167
I'll have to get some more.

07:43.792 --> 07:45.626
Come, dad bought ice slurry.

07:45.792 --> 07:47.834
Ice slurry? Nice!

07:48.959 --> 07:50.584
You love it that much?

07:50.751 --> 07:53.001
- Come on.
- Okay.

08:01.417 --> 08:04.876
Tae-yeon's even hotter now.

08:06.001 --> 08:09.792
Suh-hyun's all grown up...

08:12.376 --> 08:14.084
Don't eat it if your teeth ache.

08:14.084 --> 08:15.751
Just rice cake chunks.

08:15.917 --> 08:17.292
I'm fine.

08:19.417 --> 08:21.417
- Ahreum?
- Yes?

08:21.417 --> 08:22.959
What kind of music do you like?

08:23.334 --> 08:24.292
Why?

08:25.042 --> 08:27.501
Just wondering what my son likes.

08:29.959 --> 08:33.251
Any music sang by hot girls.

08:34.626 --> 08:35.626
Right?!

08:36.333 --> 08:38.251
Even our music taste is the same.

08:38.751 --> 08:43.458
But as I grow older, I prefer sad music.

08:44.167 --> 08:47.959
The saddest song in the world
is the one that goes with a drink.

08:48.209 --> 08:49.626
So when you grow older...

08:52.959 --> 08:54.667
Age wise...

08:55.209 --> 08:57.126
Listen to sad songs while drinking, okay?

08:57.667 --> 08:58.542
Okay-

09:00.834 --> 09:02.001
Wow...

09:02.251 --> 09:03.542
She's practically naked...

09:07.792 --> 09:09.209
Honey, it's time.

09:09.209 --> 09:10.334
Okay...

09:12.709 --> 09:13.501
Switch the channel!

09:13.501 --> 09:15.084
It hurts!

09:18.126 --> 09:19.501
Look, it's on!

09:19.584 --> 09:20.667
"Happiness"

09:21.001 --> 09:21.917
"Sharing"

09:23.626 --> 09:26.001
"GIVE HOPE TO OUR NEIGHBORS"

09:26.001 --> 09:29.001
Is it okay for 17-year olds

09:29.001 --> 09:30.626
to become parents?

09:31.251 --> 09:34.542
Is it okay

09:34.542 --> 09:36.167
to live only 17 years?

09:36.834 --> 09:39.376
This is the story of two 17-year olds
who became parents,

09:40.001 --> 09:44.417
and their son who must depart this world
when he's 17.

09:44.459 --> 09:46.876
I've never been to a school.

09:47.542 --> 09:51.501
So I'm curious as to what it feels like.

09:53.792 --> 09:59.001
When I'm better, I'd like to go.

10:00.751 --> 10:05.792
"80-YEAR OLD BOY, AHREUM"

10:08.001 --> 10:12.042
When the illness became apparent,
Ahreum moved to Bucheon,

10:12.042 --> 10:14.251
and receives weekly outpatient treatment.

10:15.626 --> 10:17.376
A day feels like a year to Ahreum.

10:17.917 --> 10:22.501
He suffers from geriatric illnesses,
including heart disease.

10:22.792 --> 10:26.501
Although he's losing sight due
to blood vessel clots,

10:26.501 --> 10:29.834
they cannot afford hospital admission.

10:30.001 --> 10:33.334
He's only 16,

10:33.334 --> 10:36.042
but physically, he's over 80.

10:36.084 --> 10:38.876
Progeria patients age 1 O times faster

10:38.876 --> 10:41.792
than normal people.

10:41.792 --> 10:43.042
"DR. LEE SEUNG-TAE (47)"

10:43.042 --> 10:46.959
Not only their skin, but bones and organs too.

10:46.959 --> 10:48.584
The cause is unknown...

10:48.584 --> 10:50.334
He looks better in person.

10:50.334 --> 10:53.292
It's an extremely rare disease

10:53.626 --> 10:55.126
that affects 1 in 30 million.

10:55.126 --> 10:57.959
Aging can be delayed slightly,

10:57.959 --> 11:02.834
but even with modern science,
there's no way to cure aging.

11:04.709 --> 11:05.959
Father.

11:06.876 --> 11:08.126
Father!

11:10.376 --> 11:12.709
Dad, dad!

11:13.834 --> 11:15.292
What?

11:17.751 --> 11:19.626
Ahreum's on TV.

11:19.959 --> 11:21.459
Ahreum?

11:22.584 --> 11:23.917
Who's that?

11:24.417 --> 11:27.584
You know, that next door granny-child prick.

11:27.751 --> 11:31.834
Your son will be on TV soon.

11:35.209 --> 11:37.001
Dad, look at me.

11:38.459 --> 11:39.917
What did you have for lunch?

11:40.667 --> 11:41.792
Flour dumplings.

11:42.334 --> 11:44.751
Good! Dad, who am I?

11:45.001 --> 11:47.584
Idiot! You're Jang!

11:47.667 --> 11:48.709
My mind may be cloudy,

11:48.709 --> 11:52.584
but I won't forget my own son.

11:52.792 --> 11:54.959
Then who are you?

11:55.167 --> 11:56.376
Me?

12:00.459 --> 12:01.667
Who am I?

12:04.667 --> 12:06.834
His father drives a cab,

12:06.834 --> 12:09.501
and mother works at a laundromat.

12:09.792 --> 12:11.459
They work hard but it's not enough

12:11.459 --> 12:14.251
to cover his medical expenses.

12:15.251 --> 12:16.584
I didn't know it was this bad.

12:16.917 --> 12:18.334
Once...

12:19.167 --> 12:21.667
when Ahreum was in ICU...

12:21.667 --> 12:22.542
"CHOI MIRA (33) MOTHER"

12:22.542 --> 12:26.292
I got a call from my mother,
that father was in grave condition.

12:27.626 --> 12:28.834
But...

12:30.876 --> 12:34.667
instead of rushing to see him,

12:34.709 --> 12:37.584
I thought, 'he lived a long life,

12:38.417 --> 12:42.792
can he die instead of Ahreum?'

12:47.126 --> 12:48.834
I'm a terrible human being.

12:49.709 --> 12:51.959
I knew it then,

12:52.167 --> 12:57.542
I realized how scary being a parent is...

13:00.959 --> 13:05.626
Ahreum loves to ride his father's cab
from time to time.

13:07.542 --> 13:09.292
Rather than a dream,

13:09.334 --> 13:11.584
"What's your dream?"

13:11.584 --> 13:13.584
I wanna be a son
who can make my parents laugh.

13:14.001 --> 13:16.251
Just growing up healthy

13:16.251 --> 13:19.501
brings joy to the parents.

13:20.209 --> 13:24.334
But I can do none of that for mine.

13:24.501 --> 13:28.917
If dad had a healthy son instead of me,

13:29.334 --> 13:34.584
he could've gone camping, or play catch...

13:34.584 --> 13:36.792
So I thought,

13:36.959 --> 13:40.584
'I should at least make them laugh!'

13:41.001 --> 13:45.417
"A TALE OF 5 SIBLINGS"

13:45.417 --> 13:49.251
"will air next week"

13:54.542 --> 13:55.501
Hey bro.

13:55.751 --> 13:57.376
Did you see?

14:00.459 --> 14:01.459
Who is it?

14:01.459 --> 14:02.584
It's me!

14:04.042 --> 14:05.626
- Good evening.
- Mr. Jang!

14:05.626 --> 14:06.792
Yo, Ahreum.

14:07.292 --> 14:09.209
That producer is a prick!

14:09.209 --> 14:09.751
Sir?

14:09.751 --> 14:15.042
How could he accept my drinks
and cut all my interviews?

14:15.292 --> 14:17.459
That's what I'm saying.

14:17.459 --> 14:18.709
How could I, the father,

14:18.709 --> 14:20.542
get less air time than the doctor?

14:20.542 --> 14:22.626
He had that cunning look to him.

14:23.876 --> 14:24.792
The doctor?

14:25.126 --> 14:27.042
No, the shithead producer!

14:27.042 --> 14:32.709
This is the 'shithead producer',
mom's old classmate, Seung-chan.

14:33.334 --> 14:34.417
Mira,

14:35.584 --> 14:37.209
it'll raise the highest donation
in our history.

14:38.126 --> 14:39.584
I told you so.

14:40.292 --> 14:43.459
Thank you,
so many people worked so hard for us.

14:43.542 --> 14:46.834
We should be thanking you.
The rating was incredible.

14:46.834 --> 14:51.917
It was the highest in that time slot,
and one of our top 3.

14:52.959 --> 14:55.626
Thanking you is all I can do.

14:56.376 --> 14:58.917
You contributed so much for us.

14:58.959 --> 15:01.626
Not at all, Ahreum made this happen.

15:01.626 --> 15:04.501
We were just closers.

15:18.126 --> 15:20.501
Ahreum, I'm off to work!

15:23.501 --> 15:27.042
No, your mom'll kill me if I take you.

15:30.126 --> 15:31.667
Damn, I'm late!

15:33.084 --> 15:34.001
Let's just go.

15:36.126 --> 15:38.792
- That little mutt.
-It's Wet Rice!

15:49.126 --> 15:49.917
Careful...

15:50.126 --> 15:51.209
General Hospital please.

15:51.209 --> 15:52.834
I'm riding with my son today,

15:52.834 --> 15:56.084
is that alright?

15:56.209 --> 16:00.001
Weren't you on TV last week?

16:01.417 --> 16:02.501
Right?

16:03.751 --> 16:04.542
Holy shit...

16:04.542 --> 16:06.334
So disgusting!

16:06.334 --> 16:08.959
I don't believe this, what the fuck!

16:12.126 --> 16:13.626
"A Boy with Progeria Talk of Town"

16:13.626 --> 16:15.251
-it's him, right?
- Look.

16:16.084 --> 16:20.001
Could we take a photo together?

16:20.001 --> 16:22.917
1,2,3!

16:23.042 --> 16:24.251
Thank you!

16:24.459 --> 16:25.792
Get well soon!

16:25.792 --> 16:27.667
Bye, study hard!

16:27.667 --> 16:29.792
- Good luck!
- Thank you!

16:30.334 --> 16:32.709
- Shall we?
- Okay.

16:34.751 --> 16:36.667
So you attended P.E. school

16:36.667 --> 16:39.584
to become a taekwondo player?

16:39.959 --> 16:40.751
Nope.

16:40.751 --> 16:44.209
Then what did you want to be?

16:44.667 --> 16:45.792
Well...

16:47.667 --> 16:50.292
I didn't know the answer to that.

16:50.792 --> 16:53.459
The only thing I liked about taekwondo
was the uniform.

16:54.542 --> 16:58.167
Can you be good at it and hate it
at the same time?

16:58.167 --> 17:00.126
Sure, so many people are like that.

17:00.959 --> 17:04.126
A friend of mine was a top ranked math student,

17:04.334 --> 17:08.126
but he said never once enjoyed it.

17:09.001 --> 17:12.834
You had a friend like that? That's a stretch.

17:17.001 --> 17:18.166
Son.

17:18.834 --> 17:22.166
Don't patronize me just because you look older.

17:22.416 --> 17:25.459
Us former athletes are sensitive to that.

17:25.626 --> 17:27.041
Okay, Okay-

17:35.001 --> 17:37.917
- Good night.
- Take care.

17:46.417 --> 17:49.292
Hey honey! Get in the back.

17:49.292 --> 17:50.417
Why?

17:51.626 --> 17:52.917
Tada!

18:00.751 --> 18:04.251
- For our family!
- Cheers!

18:09.334 --> 18:11.751
Your mom's in drinking mood.

18:20.751 --> 18:22.209
This feels so nice.

18:23.376 --> 18:25.126
Why do I love the windy day so much?

18:25.292 --> 18:26.501
Me too.

18:27.459 --> 18:31.209
Wind moves electrons in the air to other atoms,

18:31.376 --> 18:33.917
which is what makes you feel good.

18:33.959 --> 18:35.751
So smart!

18:36.042 --> 18:37.834
Who does he take after?

18:37.834 --> 18:40.126
Isn't that obvious? Me of course.

18:40.709 --> 18:42.084
What, it's true!

18:42.084 --> 18:43.792
He likes ice slurry, hates bean rice,

18:43.792 --> 18:45.084
long toes,

18:45.084 --> 18:46.751
good sense of humor and so considerate too.

18:46.792 --> 18:49.084
Calling all the good traits?

18:49.209 --> 18:51.501
He's got the beautiful eyes and brain from me.

18:52.167 --> 18:53.542
He has my eyes.

18:53.542 --> 18:57.042
Shut it, get some more beer!

18:58.542 --> 19:00.751
- Come with?
- Okay.

19:03.501 --> 19:04.751
Dad, washroom.

19:04.751 --> 19:06.917
- Sure, I'll be here.
- Okay.

19:13.542 --> 19:15.251
Are you really a kid?

19:15.251 --> 19:16.834
So friggin' weird.

19:16.834 --> 19:18.084
Maybe he's an alien.

19:18.501 --> 19:19.834
They said on TV...

19:20.709 --> 19:23.084
His disease makes him old super fast.

19:23.959 --> 19:25.209
Let me go.

19:26.001 --> 19:26.626
Give it back!

19:26.626 --> 19:28.501
- Holy shit!
- What the fuck!

19:28.501 --> 19:30.376
Damn...Is it contagious?

19:34.626 --> 19:35.667
Ahreum?

19:36.417 --> 19:37.584
Dad!

19:38.042 --> 19:39.417
You okay? Your hat?

19:39.501 --> 19:40.542
"Dad"?

19:40.876 --> 19:42.292
That's his dad?

19:47.084 --> 19:50.376
What a great son, taking his elderly father
for a walk.

19:50.667 --> 19:53.459
How can a human give birth to a gollum?

19:54.542 --> 19:55.917
Gollum.

19:56.584 --> 19:58.251
What did you say?

20:07.834 --> 20:09.584
Hold this and stay behind me.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.084
Dad...

20:13.626 --> 20:15.459
Trust me.

20:15.626 --> 20:16.709
Stay back.

20:35.917 --> 20:36.542
Dammit!

20:36.542 --> 20:37.251
HOT dang!

20:37.251 --> 20:38.292
Hot!

20:38.542 --> 20:39.626
Dang!

20:39.834 --> 20:42.334
Barn! Bam! Barn!

20:42.459 --> 20:43.292
HOT dang!

20:58.542 --> 20:59.834
Grab him!

21:06.251 --> 21:07.584
Enough! Please stop!

21:08.542 --> 21:10.751
HOT dang!

21:12.709 --> 21:14.292
Dad, no...

21:15.626 --> 21:17.792
Oh no...

21:19.084 --> 21:22.001
Are you okay? I'm so sorry...

21:22.417 --> 21:24.501
What the hell?!

21:24.501 --> 21:27.292
My son's ill, and they were teasing him,

21:27.292 --> 21:29.501
-so my husband...
- They are rascals!

21:29.501 --> 21:30.834
You attacked us first!

21:30.834 --> 21:31.626
Come here!

21:31.626 --> 21:33.584
Hit me!

21:34.167 --> 21:35.459
Come at me!

21:35.626 --> 21:37.876
Nice going, just how old are you?

21:38.042 --> 21:39.542
You got an anger issue!

21:39.542 --> 21:40.584
You promised never to fight!

21:40.584 --> 21:43.001
Then should I let them tease him

21:43.001 --> 21:44.042
and do nothing?

21:44.292 --> 21:46.834
They called him 'gollum', would you hold back?!

21:46.834 --> 21:48.751
What kind of father would I be?!

21:49.834 --> 21:51.376
Dammit...

21:51.542 --> 21:53.334
Now I'm pissed.

21:54.209 --> 21:55.042
Shit!

21:55.792 --> 21:58.376
I'll shred those sons of bitches...

21:59.876 --> 22:00.834
We have to stop her!

22:00.834 --> 22:01.334
Mira!

22:01.876 --> 22:03.042
Sweetie!

22:03.292 --> 22:04.167
Mira! Mira!

22:04.167 --> 22:05.751
I'm sorry, I'll never fight again.

22:05.751 --> 22:06.917
Let go of me!

22:06.917 --> 22:08.751
Where are you going? They're gone.

22:08.751 --> 22:10.501
I'll whip you too!

22:10.667 --> 22:12.501
Don't touch me.

22:14.709 --> 22:15.834
Mira!

22:19.251 --> 22:22.042
Mira! Please!

22:22.209 --> 22:25.167
Tonight, I finally saw...

22:25.667 --> 22:28.709
'Shit Princess' and 'Incompetent Swing Kick'.

22:33.959 --> 22:38.334
This is where the artery ruptured slightly.

22:38.334 --> 22:41.834
We were lucky, it could've led to a stroke.

22:41.834 --> 22:45.334
How could we not have known about it?

22:45.626 --> 22:47.376
The migraine must've been painful.

22:47.792 --> 22:48.959
He never said anything?

22:49.709 --> 22:52.917
I told you to say something if you felt pain.

22:53.459 --> 22:56.126
When am I ever not in pain?

22:56.126 --> 22:58.667
How could you let this happen?

22:58.667 --> 22:59.709
He may not live past this year...

22:59.709 --> 23:00.751
Doctor...

23:04.751 --> 23:06.459
- Ahreum.
- Yes?

23:07.667 --> 23:10.209
Could you go outside for a bit?

23:10.542 --> 23:13.001
I want to hear it.

23:13.251 --> 23:16.042
Honey, please go outside.

23:27.917 --> 23:34.001
Brain's one thing,
but the arteries could rupture soon.

23:34.167 --> 23:35.792
Think of it as...

23:35.792 --> 23:37.917
a ticking time bomb in his heart.

23:38.584 --> 23:42.209
Admit him right away, we can't help otherwise.

23:43.792 --> 23:46.292
Weather's so nice!

23:46.584 --> 23:48.001
Let's walk a little bit.

23:49.042 --> 23:50.626
Sweetie, don't stare.

23:50.626 --> 23:51.834
Let's go home.

23:51.834 --> 23:53.334
I didn't know he lived here.

23:54.876 --> 23:57.792
Walk faster, people are staring.

23:58.251 --> 24:00.126
Probably admiring my beauty.

24:00.917 --> 24:02.709
Aren't you embarrassed?

24:06.376 --> 24:09.459
Of what? Why should I be?

24:09.667 --> 24:11.501
What's with you?

24:13.042 --> 24:16.042
You're sick. Don't mind anything else.

24:16.251 --> 24:18.459
Don't mind the stares or the bills,

24:18.459 --> 24:19.667
just act your age.

24:19.667 --> 24:22.084
Complain and cry like a kid if it hurts!

24:22.209 --> 24:24.917
But I don't look like a kid.

24:26.501 --> 24:28.501
They stare because you wear this

24:28.501 --> 24:29.667
like a celebrity.

24:33.167 --> 24:34.626
Han Ahreum, look at me.

24:36.626 --> 24:37.751
Who am I?

24:38.417 --> 24:40.876
I was a teenage mom.

24:48.876 --> 24:52.001
How many years have we walked this road?

24:53.001 --> 24:54.167
13 years.

24:55.709 --> 24:56.709
Right.

24:57.876 --> 25:01.584
Your uncle cried like a baby
after his circumcision,

25:01.584 --> 25:04.209
when he was your age.

25:04.751 --> 25:06.459
But you went through treatments

25:06.459 --> 25:07.792
that are far worse.

25:08.876 --> 25:09.792
Yeah...

25:10.417 --> 25:12.292
Not everyone can do that.

25:12.292 --> 25:14.584
You're doing something incredible.

25:14.584 --> 25:19.667
So, walk proud and let them stare, got it?

25:20.751 --> 25:21.751
Okay-

25:23.626 --> 25:24.792
Let's go.

25:28.334 --> 25:30.376
- But mom...
- Yeah?

25:30.792 --> 25:34.876
I heard circumcision is really painful...

25:35.042 --> 25:36.584
How'd you know?

25:37.084 --> 25:39.001
I read it online.

25:40.042 --> 25:42.584
But not as painful as giving birth.

25:48.709 --> 25:50.834
Mom wrote down dad's best

25:50.834 --> 25:54.251
and worst qualities.

25:55.792 --> 25:58.876
According to her, his best qualities

25:59.417 --> 26:01.876
were 'tall and kind'.

26:03.626 --> 26:05.084
His worst were...

26:05.459 --> 26:08.459
'too tall, and too kind'.

26:10.167 --> 26:11.376
- I felt it!
- Wow!

26:11.376 --> 26:12.792
So cool!

26:12.792 --> 26:15.917
But her dad thought otherwise.

26:16.626 --> 26:18.542
"The only thing he's good

26:18.542 --> 26:20.667
at is getting my daughter pregnant!"

26:21.792 --> 26:23.667
Then grandma said

26:24.001 --> 26:28.751
"at least he's good at something".

27:09.209 --> 27:10.584
"1 New E-mail"

27:10.584 --> 27:13.292
Hi. My name is Lee Suh-ha.

27:13.292 --> 27:15.751
I'm 16, same age as you.

27:16.084 --> 27:19.167
I managed to get your e-mail
from the TV station.

27:19.417 --> 27:21.459
They probably took pity on me

27:21.459 --> 27:23.001
because I'm sick too.

27:23.584 --> 27:25.001
After seeing your episode,

27:25.001 --> 27:28.459
I thought we could be friends.

27:29.167 --> 27:32.292
A minute of my life

27:32.292 --> 27:34.459
feels like an eternity too.

27:35.126 --> 27:37.667
Good luck, wish you well.

27:38.917 --> 27:40.542
Lee Suh-ha?

27:44.001 --> 27:48.501
Hi. My name is Lee Suh-ha. Same age as you.

27:57.667 --> 28:01.667
Hi. My name is Lee Suh-ha. Same age as you.

28:08.876 --> 28:11.542
Hi. My name is Lee Suh-ha.

28:12.376 --> 28:14.542
Same age as you.

28:24.667 --> 28:26.042
It's all my fault.

28:26.751 --> 28:27.792
What is?

28:28.626 --> 28:31.126
I think it was all my fault.

28:33.001 --> 28:37.042
Mira, it's no one's fault, it just happened.

28:37.042 --> 28:39.376
Doctors said so, it's not genetic.

28:39.751 --> 28:42.501
If only I didn't do that then...

28:43.459 --> 28:45.917
Ahreum wouldn't be like that.

28:47.459 --> 28:49.501
How many times have I told you?

28:49.501 --> 28:51.709
It was a random mutation.

28:52.167 --> 28:54.876
Jogging while pregnant didn't cause it.

28:57.501 --> 28:59.959
My mom didn't know she was pregnant

28:59.959 --> 29:02.042
and did all kinds of exercises.

29:02.209 --> 29:03.417
No!

29:03.834 --> 29:06.334
Iran 10, 20 laps all night until

29:06.334 --> 29:08.667
my heart was ready to explode!

29:13.084 --> 29:17.751
I prayed, 'please don't let it be born'.

29:23.292 --> 29:24.251
Dae-su...

29:26.334 --> 29:31.001
Could our baby...ever come home again?

29:34.126 --> 29:36.209
Don't say that.

29:59.959 --> 30:04.417
Iran 10, 20 laps all night until

30:04.417 --> 30:06.751
my heart was ready to explode.

30:06.751 --> 30:08.876
"That Brilliant Summer"

30:09.251 --> 30:13.792
I prayed, 'please don't let it be born'.

30:17.084 --> 30:20.084
"Would you like to permanently erase
'Cosmos.hwp'?"

30:22.501 --> 30:27.167
'Please don't let it be born'.

30:44.667 --> 30:47.751
Mr. Jang, I'll be admitted tomorrow.

30:48.959 --> 30:50.417
That's good.

30:52.417 --> 30:53.709
When do you discharge?

30:54.876 --> 30:57.584
Well...When I get better.

30:58.334 --> 31:00.584
You'll be out in no time.

31:10.959 --> 31:12.584
Does that taste good?

31:12.917 --> 31:14.292
Soju?

31:15.459 --> 31:16.959
It's foul, of course.

31:17.917 --> 31:19.292
Then why do you drink it?

31:21.001 --> 31:24.626
Do you stop living because life's foul? Nope.

31:25.126 --> 31:26.834
Same can be said about soju.

31:29.209 --> 31:30.792
Damn, that'll kill me!

31:31.417 --> 31:32.501
Strange, eh?

31:33.667 --> 31:35.292
You're too young to know.

31:38.751 --> 31:41.126
- Mr. Jang? \N- Yes??

31:42.501 --> 31:44.709
Is it normal for a girl to see me

31:44.709 --> 31:49.001
and want to be my friend?

31:49.001 --> 31:51.542
How could that be normal?
She's probably sick too.

31:52.667 --> 31:55.417
How did you know? That she's sick?

31:56.376 --> 31:58.251
Can't I even joke?

31:59.042 --> 32:02.334
Why? Does she like you?

32:03.459 --> 32:08.042
It's not that...l got an e-mail.

32:08.209 --> 32:09.292
Did you reply?

32:11.001 --> 32:14.376
It's a bit annoying.

32:14.626 --> 32:16.334
Yeah, girls are annoying.

32:16.334 --> 32:19.209
But curious too...

32:19.209 --> 32:21.001
Yeah, girls are curious beings.

32:21.001 --> 32:22.251
And...

32:22.251 --> 32:23.542
- Hey!
- Yeah?

32:23.584 --> 32:26.042
Why are you so complicated, you idiot.

32:26.334 --> 32:28.334
Just do what you feel.

32:28.459 --> 32:30.501
Yeah, as I feel.

32:33.001 --> 32:35.917
Look, it's your father.

32:36.876 --> 32:37.834
Father!

32:39.417 --> 32:40.542
I'm off.

32:41.751 --> 32:43.042
Dad! Dad!

32:44.584 --> 32:46.459
This isn't our home.

32:46.876 --> 32:48.001
Good afternoon.

32:48.917 --> 32:50.626
Who is this gentleman?

32:51.042 --> 32:53.376
It's Ahreum next door!

32:56.209 --> 32:57.959
Pleased to meet you, sir.

32:58.542 --> 33:00.959
Come on, dad.

33:02.292 --> 33:05.042
- Ahreum, see you!
- Bye!

33:09.042 --> 33:12.709
Are you going to the pediatrics
or the geriatrics?

33:13.459 --> 33:14.251
What?

33:14.542 --> 33:16.501
Can't you even catch?

33:16.501 --> 33:17.584
Here it comes!

33:17.584 --> 33:19.251
Catch it properly!

33:19.251 --> 33:20.584
It's your fault!

33:20.584 --> 33:21.542
Whatever!

33:22.084 --> 33:23.542
Screw you!

33:24.126 --> 33:25.917
Stop it!

33:25.917 --> 33:28.876
You can't say that to me!

33:28.876 --> 33:30.251
Grandpa.

33:38.334 --> 33:41.042
- He's a grandpa!
- No, he's not!

33:41.459 --> 33:44.626
Look at his wrinkly face!

33:57.376 --> 33:58.251
Amen

34:03.334 --> 34:06.209
This patient has progeria.

34:06.834 --> 34:07.876
Pro-what?

34:07.876 --> 34:12.208
It's called progeria. They age much faster.

34:12.208 --> 34:13.542
I see.

34:15.958 --> 34:17.083
Oh Lord...

34:17.083 --> 34:18.251
Please begin.

34:18.251 --> 34:21.251
- Reach out...
- Reach out...

34:21.251 --> 34:24.083
-your sick hands...
-your sick hands...

34:24.083 --> 34:26.083
-towards Jesus.
-towards Jesus.

34:26.083 --> 34:27.292
Who are you?

34:29.542 --> 34:31.292
What are you doing?

34:34.501 --> 34:38.126
Are you his family?

34:38.376 --> 34:39.876
Yeah, I'm his dad.

34:40.292 --> 34:41.542
What?

34:42.042 --> 34:46.042
- They look alike, right?
-Indeed.

34:46.542 --> 34:48.917
- Hallelujah!
- Hallelujah!

34:50.917 --> 34:52.917
Sir...

34:53.958 --> 34:55.626
This child is a message.

34:55.833 --> 35:02.542
He's a message sent by God to us sinners!

35:02.542 --> 35:03.667
Ma'am!

35:04.126 --> 35:07.834
My child is not a message,
his name is Han Ahreum! Leave us!

35:07.834 --> 35:10.417
- Save your soul...
- Get out of here! Go!

35:10.417 --> 35:11.667
But sir!

35:11.667 --> 35:14.834
- Let's pray together!
- No need.

35:14.834 --> 35:18.126
In the name of Holy Father,
Progeria Satan, go away!

35:18.876 --> 35:20.126
Afternoon.

35:20.834 --> 35:23.292
- This is for Ahreum.
- Thank you.

35:23.876 --> 35:26.334
These are gifts from the viewers.

35:26.334 --> 35:28.501
Even the books that you like.

35:28.959 --> 35:30.751
You must be thrilled!

35:31.292 --> 35:33.001
Ahreum, open this too.

35:33.251 --> 35:34.459
What's this?

35:36.501 --> 35:38.209
It's a game console!

35:40.501 --> 35:41.542
Wow!

35:44.292 --> 35:47.501
Thank you for your e-mail.

35:48.292 --> 35:54.001
Thank you for wishing me luck

35:54.001 --> 35:55.417
rather than good health.

35:55.917 --> 35:59.376
You be well too, sincerely Han Ahreum.

36:00.501 --> 36:01.251
"Mail sent"

36:11.459 --> 36:12.667
"I "Inbox""

36:15.459 --> 36:16.667
"Lee Suh-ha
- I read your e-mail"

36:20.834 --> 36:23.501
I read your e-mail a hundred times.

36:23.501 --> 36:27.084
I laughed at first, but I realized it later,

36:27.501 --> 36:29.584
that you're afraid.

36:30.251 --> 36:33.917
But I'm glad that you liked the word 'luck'.

36:34.501 --> 36:37.501
Could I write you again?

36:38.501 --> 36:40.584
What's wrong with my e-mail?

36:41.876 --> 36:43.376
"REPLY"

36:43.876 --> 36:45.417
Thank you for your letter.

36:45.792 --> 36:50.376
I was hesitant when I first read your e-mail.

36:50.376 --> 36:52.501
Fearing that it was a prank.

36:58.167 --> 36:59.334
"He wants to be your friend,
you two look identical."

37:00.709 --> 37:02.626
"if I were you, I'd KILL MYSELF haha"

37:02.626 --> 37:04.126
"You're repenting for your past life."

37:06.792 --> 37:08.459
Sorry for the misunderstanding.

37:08.834 --> 37:12.709
I don't know how sick you are,
but get well soon.

37:12.709 --> 37:14.167
Honestly.

37:14.334 --> 37:18.417
If it's okay, write me back. So long.

37:20.917 --> 37:24.042
'If it's okay, write me back'

37:24.917 --> 37:27.292
I laughed quite a bit reading that.

37:27.751 --> 37:31.292
You express your feelings rather humorously.

37:31.834 --> 37:35.292
I wanted to comfort you with this song.

37:35.959 --> 37:41.001
I hope that this song
and I could be your true friends.

37:41.917 --> 37:43.084
Good night.

39:19.209 --> 39:20.834
Follow-up episode?

39:21.209 --> 39:22.751
No, he's too frail.

39:22.751 --> 39:23.792
Mira, listen.

39:23.959 --> 39:27.626
I understand, I do. But it's from the top.

39:27.626 --> 39:29.167
Please think of my position too.

39:29.584 --> 39:31.334
It went so well last time.

39:31.334 --> 39:33.251
I know, but we...

39:33.876 --> 39:36.209
Anyway, we just can't do it.

39:36.209 --> 39:38.251
Look, Mira...

39:39.417 --> 39:41.292
- You're up?
- Yeah.

39:41.292 --> 39:42.626
I want to do the show.

39:43.876 --> 39:44.876
What?

39:44.876 --> 39:47.417
You don't have to. We got enough donation...

39:47.417 --> 39:50.584
I'll do it, I don't mind.

39:51.917 --> 39:55.501
I know you did the show
so I don't have to work.

39:56.501 --> 39:58.834
You're so smart...

39:59.251 --> 40:00.876
You could've gone to Harvard.

40:03.459 --> 40:06.292
But if dad finds out you're doing this for him,

40:06.292 --> 40:07.792
he won't be happy.

40:07.834 --> 40:11.251
It's okay. Dad'll never find out.

40:12.584 --> 40:15.209
Where did he go on his day off?

40:19.792 --> 40:21.167
"Morning Sickness Pill"

40:24.709 --> 40:25.459
Why aren't you eating?

40:25.459 --> 40:28.126
Mom, are you sick?

40:30.917 --> 40:33.959
It's nothing, just vitamins.

40:34.292 --> 40:37.209
Where the heck is he?

40:40.917 --> 40:43.292
Go away! Go away!

40:43.876 --> 40:45.417
He's our grim reaper!

40:45.917 --> 40:49.084
Go away! Go away!

40:52.042 --> 40:53.667
Bro, let's go!

40:54.501 --> 40:57.167
This is pretty tough line of work.

40:59.376 --> 41:01.709
Good work, boss.

41:02.126 --> 41:03.542
Let's go to a spa.

41:03.792 --> 41:06.126
Don't call me that.

41:06.834 --> 41:08.042
Thank you.

41:08.417 --> 41:10.501
Hey, allow me to treat you.

41:11.209 --> 41:12.501
Black for me.

41:13.376 --> 41:17.126
I sent all my boys
on a rock concert security detail,

41:17.334 --> 41:19.209
so I had to SOS you.

41:19.209 --> 41:20.751
I'm always thankful.

41:20.751 --> 41:23.417
Oh yeah, how's your next weekend?

41:23.417 --> 41:24.417
What's up?

41:24.542 --> 41:28.584
With all these concerts and festivals,
we're short staffed.

41:28.584 --> 41:30.501
I'm always good to go!

41:30.501 --> 41:32.126
Heard of 'Star Date'?

41:32.751 --> 41:35.834
They're filming a live interview
with Girl's Generation,

41:35.834 --> 41:38.584
and we need extra manpower.

41:39.917 --> 41:41.459
Girl's Generation?

41:44.501 --> 41:45.834
Girl's Generation...

41:48.792 --> 41:52.459
- Seriously!
- I'm sorry, you okay?

41:54.334 --> 41:55.334
Wait...

41:56.334 --> 41:58.459
Judging by your son's state,

41:58.667 --> 42:01.167
you must pray especially hard.

42:01.417 --> 42:05.501
Our Lord listens to everyone, amen.

42:06.417 --> 42:08.542
May you attain Buddhahood.

42:08.792 --> 42:10.001
You'll go to hell.

42:11.167 --> 42:13.334
Then I'll see you there.

42:13.959 --> 42:16.334
Son of a bitch!

42:16.917 --> 42:18.584
Oh Lord...

42:19.751 --> 42:23.542
I'm here, dad's here! With fried chicken!

42:23.542 --> 42:26.209
Dad brought your favorite!

42:26.667 --> 42:29.626
Forgetting that you need
to fast for tomorrow's test.

42:30.626 --> 42:33.251
Nice going, bravo.

42:34.292 --> 42:35.834
I forgot about the test...

42:35.959 --> 42:39.042
How come you're always the one who forgets?

42:39.042 --> 42:41.084
It was written here since the morning!

42:44.001 --> 42:47.084
Hot dang, I ran so you could eat it
while it's hot.

42:47.376 --> 42:48.667
Hot dang...

42:49.667 --> 42:52.417
I'll have it after the test.

42:52.584 --> 42:54.792
Right? Problem solved.

42:57.334 --> 42:59.834
Drumstick's awesome when it's hot.

43:01.042 --> 43:04.001
By the way, you never play with that gift.

43:05.417 --> 43:07.251
- Which one?
- You know...

43:10.126 --> 43:11.334
This one.

43:11.959 --> 43:13.209
You didn't even open it?

43:13.292 --> 43:14.209
No, not yet.

43:15.042 --> 43:20.334
Ahreum, why don't you try it,
and if you don't like it...

43:23.042 --> 43:24.209
could I have it?

43:25.417 --> 43:26.167
Sure.

43:27.834 --> 43:29.084
Try it now.

43:30.917 --> 43:32.126
Right now?

43:32.126 --> 43:33.459
Yup!

43:58.709 --> 44:00.042
Good job.

44:01.292 --> 44:02.209
Before the broadcast,

44:02.209 --> 44:06.584
I thought, 'Why'd anyone help us fight this?'

44:07.876 --> 44:09.709
It's an anonymous donation.

44:10.417 --> 44:11.792
Whoa...

44:12.084 --> 44:13.501
This is $10,000!

44:14.167 --> 44:16.334
- Who would do this?
- Who knows?

44:16.334 --> 44:17.834
Shouldn't we go thank this person?

44:17.834 --> 44:18.751
Any contact info?

44:18.876 --> 44:23.084
Seung-chan said it wouldn't be appropriate.

44:24.959 --> 44:27.167
Don't work too hard.

44:27.459 --> 44:30.334
Play with your son on your day off.

44:31.709 --> 44:35.626
I gotta work hard, and buy him nice stuff.

44:36.917 --> 44:41.542
And when he discharges,
we need a house without stairs.

44:44.042 --> 44:45.792
That'd be nice.

44:47.834 --> 44:48.751
- Dae-su?
- Yeah?

44:49.292 --> 44:53.376
What do you want our child to be?

44:53.376 --> 44:56.876
Why do you speak with that dialect? It's weird.

44:57.376 --> 45:00.876
I want to teach our child Seoul dialect.

45:00.876 --> 45:02.667
I'm practicing it now.

45:03.251 --> 45:05.167
It's so weird!

45:05.376 --> 45:07.501
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

45:08.292 --> 45:10.167
It does feel a little awkward.

45:10.376 --> 45:14.459
Anyway, what do you want him to be?

45:15.251 --> 45:16.834
Well...

45:17.417 --> 45:19.792
Athletic type like me?

45:19.792 --> 45:21.292
Or musically talented like you?

45:21.709 --> 45:22.584
YOU?

45:23.209 --> 45:26.292
Someone who is loved by everyone.

45:26.959 --> 45:31.042
That means he has to be smart AND handsome.

45:31.084 --> 45:33.459
Yeah? I guess so.

45:33.626 --> 45:36.251
That's the douchebag type.

45:37.126 --> 45:38.709
Like that new transfer Seung-chan.

45:42.126 --> 45:45.126
Mira, now that I think about it...

45:45.667 --> 45:48.626
I don't care about anything else,

45:48.626 --> 45:50.417
as long as he's healthy.

45:51.501 --> 45:54.459
Yeah, that sounds perfect!

46:00.792 --> 46:02.334
Hey, old man!

46:03.667 --> 46:05.042
Yo, Jang!

46:05.334 --> 46:07.834
Still a brat I see.

46:08.917 --> 46:11.334
We're both old men.

46:12.251 --> 46:13.876
I guess so.

46:14.292 --> 46:17.501
You looked like a movie star.

46:17.501 --> 46:18.501
Right?

46:19.042 --> 46:21.167
One moment, sir.

46:21.167 --> 46:22.501
Mr. Seung-chan!

46:22.876 --> 46:23.292
Huh?

46:25.542 --> 46:28.501
I wanted to thank you.

46:28.751 --> 46:31.501
Me? For what?

46:32.001 --> 46:34.751
For giving Suh-ha my e-mail address.

46:35.042 --> 46:36.209
Suh-ha?

46:37.542 --> 46:38.542
It wasn't me.

46:38.751 --> 46:40.542
I think one of my staff gave it to her.

46:40.792 --> 46:42.542
I'm sorry, I'll go scold them later.

46:43.209 --> 46:47.042
No, thanks to that I got a good friend.

46:47.042 --> 46:49.084
Oh yeah? Who is she?

46:49.792 --> 46:55.084
I only know her name and that she's my age.

46:56.792 --> 47:02.417
She's sick and in a hospital too.

47:03.084 --> 47:04.834
She's sick too?

47:05.001 --> 47:05.959
Yes.

47:06.376 --> 47:08.876
I see.

47:10.209 --> 47:12.584
Okay, I'll see you next week.

47:12.709 --> 47:13.709
Yes.

47:13.959 --> 47:14.959
Sir.

47:16.667 --> 47:22.792
About Suh-ha, please keep it to yourself.

47:23.417 --> 47:25.001
Okay, I got it.

47:27.209 --> 47:29.709
Shooting again?

47:29.959 --> 47:32.876
Yeah, the last one was well-received.

47:33.334 --> 47:36.209
That prick sure shot a lot,

47:36.209 --> 47:39.042
but I barely got 20 seconds.

47:40.751 --> 47:42.376
So when will they shoot again?

47:43.167 --> 47:46.251
Every Wednesday, once a week.

47:46.709 --> 47:48.542
- Wednesday?
- Yeah.

47:48.542 --> 47:50.126
Is that so?

47:53.792 --> 47:54.959
Dear Suh-ha.

47:55.792 --> 47:59.126
I don't know much about you.

47:59.501 --> 48:02.626
Could you tell me something about you?

48:04.292 --> 48:07.501
It wasn't intentional,
but I'm sorry it felt that way.

48:08.209 --> 48:11.834
My mom died of bone marrow infection.

48:11.834 --> 48:14.459
I have the same disease.

48:14.459 --> 48:17.542
And dad sacrificed so much for me.

48:18.292 --> 48:23.001
My folks gave up everything for me,

48:23.542 --> 48:25.792
their dreams and education.

48:26.292 --> 48:28.501
I want to be a writer.

48:29.001 --> 48:33.167
Dad wants me to be a doctor,

48:33.167 --> 48:35.417
so I say that to him,

48:35.709 --> 48:39.209
but my real dream is to become a writer.

48:39.709 --> 48:42.834
I think writers are all fabulous.

48:44.126 --> 48:49.001
Her dream is to become a writer?
Writers are fabulous?

48:49.251 --> 48:50.209
Dear Suh-ha.

48:50.542 --> 48:53.042
My dream is also a writer.

48:53.167 --> 48:57.459
I've been writing about my parents recently.

48:57.626 --> 49:01.417
When they were both 17,

49:01.417 --> 49:03.709
they first met deep in the woods.

49:03.709 --> 49:08.667
My dad was suspended from school,

49:08.667 --> 49:13.709
and he spent his summer swimming in the valley.

49:13.709 --> 49:16.792
When mom showed up,

49:16.792 --> 49:19.167
he thought she was a fairy.

49:20.251 --> 49:24.542
Mom wanted to move to Seoul to become a singer.

49:25.376 --> 49:29.459
And dad wanted to be a national athlete.

49:47.126 --> 49:50.709
All over the nose, isn't it, Suh-hyun?

49:51.959 --> 49:53.792
Could you adjust Suh-hyun's hair?

49:53.792 --> 49:56.251
Her make-up looks natural today.

49:56.501 --> 49:57.751
I'm always like that.

49:57.959 --> 50:00.626
I want my skin to glitter more.

50:03.501 --> 50:04.709
Did you try the earrings?

50:04.709 --> 50:06.251
Yeah, the pearls.

50:06.251 --> 50:09.042
The two of us will escort them to the studio.

50:09.834 --> 50:11.792
Wait, is he new?

50:12.334 --> 50:14.876
He's really hot.

50:15.251 --> 50:16.292
Wow!

50:17.459 --> 50:18.959
Hello!

50:19.251 --> 50:20.959
He's my senior,

50:20.959 --> 50:22.084
we used to work together.

50:22.292 --> 50:23.542
Senior?

50:23.876 --> 50:25.709
You look so much younger.

50:26.459 --> 50:27.667
How old are you?

50:27.917 --> 50:29.126
He looks young,

50:29.126 --> 50:30.834
but he has a 16-year old son.

50:31.126 --> 50:31.917
Seriously?

50:31.917 --> 50:34.917
So when did you have your son?

50:35.667 --> 50:38.042
When I...was 17...

50:38.042 --> 50:39.626
What? Are you serious?

50:39.626 --> 50:42.959
Wow! 17!

50:43.917 --> 50:46.376
"Standby!
'Okay!

50:46.834 --> 50:47.792
We're en route.

50:47.792 --> 50:49.084
This is Star Date

50:49.084 --> 50:50.251
with Girl's Generation.

50:50.251 --> 50:54.209
Let's welcome 3 members from the group!

50:54.334 --> 50:57.167
Hello! Let's start our date!

50:57.167 --> 50:59.001
It's been a long time,

50:59.126 --> 51:02.334
so many of your fans are waiting
for you outside.

51:02.334 --> 51:04.376
- Thank you!
- Hi!

51:04.376 --> 51:05.334
Mom,mom.

51:06.084 --> 51:07.626
Isn't that dad?

51:10.167 --> 51:11.292
What the!

51:12.417 --> 51:14.834
What the hell is he doing there?

51:15.834 --> 51:18.501
I don't believe this...

51:18.501 --> 51:22.584
...wanted to coordinate.

51:23.542 --> 51:26.584
So beautiful! Very bling bling!

51:26.959 --> 51:28.626
Bling bling!

51:49.209 --> 51:50.001
What was that?

51:51.167 --> 51:53.501
Huh? Nothing.

52:11.334 --> 52:12.084
Ahreum.

52:12.959 --> 52:13.751
Mr. Seung-chan.

52:13.792 --> 52:15.042
A present.

52:15.584 --> 52:16.542
Thank you.

52:18.959 --> 52:20.584
Could I talk to you for a minute?

52:20.751 --> 52:21.834
Sure.

52:26.876 --> 52:30.209
Are you still in contact with Suh-ha?

52:30.667 --> 52:31.376
Yes.

52:33.126 --> 52:35.126
Do you have her contact info?

52:35.251 --> 52:36.917
Only her e-mail address.

52:37.126 --> 52:38.459
Is that so?

52:39.501 --> 52:41.667
Can I get that from you?

52:42.792 --> 52:44.042
Why?

52:46.042 --> 52:49.834
We had a meeting at the station,

52:49.917 --> 52:53.251
and we thought of introducing the friendship

52:53.251 --> 52:56.042
between you and Suh-ha
in the follow-up episode.

52:56.334 --> 52:59.501
What? I told you to keep it to yourself!

52:59.501 --> 53:03.167
I'm so sorry. It slipped out by accident.

53:05.376 --> 53:08.876
But...can't you help me out?

53:09.876 --> 53:12.834
She probably will say no.

53:12.959 --> 53:16.167
If she says no, of course I won't do it.

53:16.376 --> 53:20.042
But going on TV could help her as well.

53:20.376 --> 53:24.834
And this could be your chance
to meet her in person.

53:27.209 --> 53:30.126
Have you ever liked someone?

53:30.792 --> 53:33.167
My mom, dad,

53:33.417 --> 53:38.167
grandma, grandpa,
and Girl's Generation's Tae-yeon.

53:38.626 --> 53:41.917
Oh! And Mr. Jang next door.

53:46.126 --> 53:47.501
Cut! Cut!

53:48.209 --> 53:50.459
You okay? Honey?

53:50.876 --> 53:53.001
I guess it'll be hard to continue?

53:53.459 --> 53:56.626
How can you even ask me that?

53:56.751 --> 53:59.501
Yeah, I thought so...

53:59.959 --> 54:01.626
ls Ahreum okay?

54:01.626 --> 54:04.209
Yeah, he's resting now.

54:05.751 --> 54:07.917
Aren't you Ahreum's neighbor?

54:08.084 --> 54:09.084
Yes.

54:10.042 --> 54:12.042
How about an interview?

54:12.417 --> 54:13.876
- Me?
- Yes.

54:14.626 --> 54:16.084
Should I sit there?

54:16.292 --> 54:17.917
- Please.
- Okay.

54:18.542 --> 54:19.584
Thanks.

54:20.084 --> 54:23.001
Sir, are you ready? Let's begin.

54:23.209 --> 54:24.251
Action!

54:24.542 --> 54:27.251
What kind of boy is Ahreum?

54:27.876 --> 54:29.251
Lee Ahreum is...

54:29.667 --> 54:32.542
- Han Ahreum.
- Right, Han Ahreum.

54:32.626 --> 54:34.042
Action!

54:34.459 --> 54:36.876
Han Yureum is...

54:37.084 --> 54:38.334
Okay, cut.

54:38.792 --> 54:42.084
Imagine the camera's not here,
just talk to Ms. Kim.

54:42.251 --> 54:44.292
Let's go again.

54:45.376 --> 54:46.334
Action!

54:46.584 --> 54:47.959
That bastard Ahreum is...

54:48.209 --> 54:50.167
No swearing sir...

54:51.542 --> 54:52.917
Once more, one more time.

54:53.417 --> 54:55.584
- Fix his hat.
- Okay.

54:55.709 --> 54:57.376
Allow me.

54:58.917 --> 55:01.626
- What's wrong with me?
-It's alright, sir.

55:01.626 --> 55:03.084
I practiced a lot.

55:03.209 --> 55:05.126
Action!

55:06.917 --> 55:09.501
What kind of boy is Ahreum?

55:12.917 --> 55:14.167
Ahreum is...

55:15.834 --> 55:17.251
a friend.

55:19.584 --> 55:21.084
My friend.

55:23.917 --> 55:27.126
Taping is no joke.

55:27.459 --> 55:28.626
Isn't it?

55:29.417 --> 55:30.876
Thank you.

55:31.126 --> 55:33.709
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.

55:33.917 --> 55:35.834
- Hold this for a sec.
- Okay.

55:38.334 --> 55:39.876
Mr. Jang, are you sick?

55:40.417 --> 55:43.209
It'd be weird if we weren't.

55:43.792 --> 55:45.751
You got that right.

55:47.251 --> 55:50.501
But you look young for your age.

55:50.501 --> 55:51.751
I know it!

55:51.917 --> 55:53.459
IN I'm sorry! Q, km'

55:54.417 --> 55:56.584
Kids! Settle down!

55:56.709 --> 55:58.626
- You heard him.
- Which room was it?

55:58.626 --> 56:02.001
They don't know how marvelous youth is.

56:02.917 --> 56:06.876
They're too healthy
to know that they're healthy.

56:07.834 --> 56:10.126
There's another thing they don't know.

56:11.126 --> 56:12.001
What is that?

56:12.709 --> 56:14.584
They too will age in time.

56:17.501 --> 56:19.417
Right on!

56:24.584 --> 56:26.001
Afternoon.

56:29.167 --> 56:30.376
What are you reading?

56:30.417 --> 56:31.792
It's a novel.

56:32.334 --> 56:36.959
An Indian boy's ship sunk
on his way to America,

56:36.959 --> 56:37.917
so he's on a rescue boat

56:37.917 --> 56:39.334
with a tiger...

56:39.334 --> 56:40.376
Enough for now.

56:40.792 --> 56:42.542
Give it back, I won't read it.

56:42.792 --> 56:45.167
If he squints, don't let him read.

56:45.501 --> 56:47.626
Computer, TV, books, anything.

56:47.917 --> 56:49.667
You know how bad his eyes are.

56:50.209 --> 56:51.251
Come on...

56:51.334 --> 56:52.959
Then what am I supposed to do here?

56:53.084 --> 56:55.209
Get better, of course.

56:56.084 --> 56:58.042
Alcohol, cigarettes, caffeine, all prohibited.

56:58.334 --> 57:00.001
Don't smoke or drink...

57:04.084 --> 57:05.042
Of course not yet...

57:05.501 --> 57:08.584
Despite his looks, he's still a teenager,

57:08.584 --> 57:11.751
and teens get curious...

57:12.292 --> 57:14.209
Do it when you reach college,

57:14.209 --> 57:15.834
you can do plenty then.

57:15.834 --> 57:17.834
Go back to sleep, rest up.

57:17.834 --> 57:20.334
Close your eyes and meditate.

57:22.917 --> 57:24.542
He's one of a kind...

57:34.917 --> 57:36.626
I hate to do this,

57:36.626 --> 57:38.709
but can I ask you a favor.

57:39.084 --> 57:43.501
Suh-ha, I'm slowly losing my sight.

57:43.917 --> 57:48.042
Could you send me a picture of you?

57:49.167 --> 57:54.459
I didn't want to regret later,
so I worked up the courage.

57:54.459 --> 57:55.501
E-mail sent

58:07.376 --> 58:09.417
Sorry for the late reply.

58:09.876 --> 58:12.834
I thought over your favor a lot.

58:13.584 --> 58:17.876
It's unfair that only I know
what you look like.

58:18.417 --> 58:21.917
I even know what your parents look like.

58:22.459 --> 58:26.667
I don't know if you'll like it,
but I'm sending you one.

59:01.751 --> 59:02.876
Ahreum?

59:03.292 --> 59:05.251
When do you feel alive?

59:07.667 --> 59:11.667
When do you feel like you want to keep living?

59:13.876 --> 59:15.751
When do I want to live?

59:18.917 --> 59:22.251
When I see fleecy clouds in the blue sky...

59:23.334 --> 59:29.042
When I hear kids' laughter, I want to live.

59:32.251 --> 59:34.834
On a clear day, when I smell

59:35.334 --> 59:39.042
sun-dried laundry with my mom...

59:42.126 --> 59:45.251
When I see the gruff shopkeeper

59:45.792 --> 59:47.584
cry like a girl

59:47.584 --> 59:50.626
while watching soap opera...

59:51.417 --> 59:52.792
When I hear a granny

59:52.792 --> 59:58.459
calling out to her grand kids for dinner...

01:00:01.209 --> 01:00:08.917
When mom splashes cold water
on dad's back in the summer...

01:00:12.834 --> 01:00:16.459
When I see Venus moments

01:00:16.959 --> 01:00:19.501
after sunset with my dad...

01:00:20.667 --> 01:00:22.876
When I see blinking lights

01:00:23.084 --> 01:00:27.959
of airplanes on their night flight,
I want to live.

01:00:29.501 --> 01:00:31.876
Suh-ha, what about you?

01:00:34.751 --> 01:00:38.501
It's been 10 days since her last e-mail.

01:00:39.209 --> 01:00:42.584
Could something have happened?

01:00:43.584 --> 01:00:46.667
Suh-ha, I haven't heard from you.

01:00:47.251 --> 01:00:48.834
I'm worried about you.

01:00:49.292 --> 01:00:52.834
When you see this, please reply.

01:01:00.542 --> 01:01:02.917
Did you change the meds again?

01:01:03.042 --> 01:01:07.667
He needs something with much higher dosage.

01:01:08.126 --> 01:01:09.709
You changed it not long ago.

01:01:09.959 --> 01:01:11.542
The thing is...

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:13.876
So when do I die?

01:01:14.626 --> 01:01:16.667
- What?
- Ahreum!

01:01:16.667 --> 01:01:20.334
I should know too, rough idea of it.

01:01:22.251 --> 01:01:24.501
The treatment will make you better!

01:01:24.501 --> 01:01:28.417
Do you know how hard it is to wait

01:01:28.417 --> 01:01:30.959
for my day to come?

01:01:33.084 --> 01:01:35.167
Just tell me.

01:01:43.084 --> 01:01:44.584
Do you really want to know?

01:01:45.709 --> 01:01:46.751
Yes.

01:01:50.709 --> 01:01:53.292
A month,

01:01:55.126 --> 01:01:57.001
or <i>2</i> months at best.

01:02:03.667 --> 01:02:04.959
-$0 funny!
- Hey.

01:02:05.209 --> 01:02:06.292
Yeah?

01:02:06.626 --> 01:02:09.584
Let's go to a hot spring in spring.

01:02:09.959 --> 01:02:14.126
Sure, I've never been.

01:02:14.126 --> 01:02:15.542
- Promise.
- Promise!

01:02:15.542 --> 01:02:17.042
- Sure?
- Yup.

01:02:17.042 --> 01:02:18.417
- Got it?
- Yup.

01:02:19.709 --> 01:02:23.751
It's already time to feed my father.

01:02:24.292 --> 01:02:26.417
- I have to go.
- Okay.

01:02:26.584 --> 01:02:28.542
- Mr. Jang?
- Yeah?

01:02:28.667 --> 01:02:31.376
- I have a favor.
- What is it?

01:02:31.501 --> 01:02:34.376
- Promise me not to get mad?
- Spit it out.

01:02:35.292 --> 01:02:38.542
Could you bring me some alcohol?

01:02:39.459 --> 01:02:41.209
What? Soju?

01:02:41.417 --> 01:02:45.459
I want to taste it before it's too late.

01:02:45.459 --> 01:02:48.001
You idiot! 'Before too late'?

01:02:48.542 --> 01:02:51.126
You got a long future ahead of you!

01:02:51.667 --> 01:02:53.001
But sir...

01:02:53.001 --> 01:02:53.959
Let go!

01:02:55.959 --> 01:02:57.792
What do you take me for!

01:03:19.209 --> 01:03:22.042
Mira, can we talk for a moment?

01:03:22.376 --> 01:03:23.792
Who the hell is he?!

01:03:24.376 --> 01:03:26.126
He says he's a film director.

01:03:26.126 --> 01:03:28.084
Probably a wannabe.

01:03:28.376 --> 01:03:30.959
He says he's writing a screenplay

01:03:31.334 --> 01:03:32.876
for his debut film.

01:03:33.167 --> 01:03:34.584
Screenplay?

01:03:35.001 --> 01:03:37.459
That's why he started this.

01:03:37.459 --> 01:03:38.917
I can't believe it myself.

01:03:39.126 --> 01:03:40.334
What is it about?

01:03:40.542 --> 01:03:43.501
A love story between a boy with progeria

01:03:43.501 --> 01:03:46.501
and a girl with an incurable disease.

01:03:50.834 --> 01:03:53.209
- So?
- What?

01:03:53.584 --> 01:03:56.334
So what did you do?!
Did you report him to the cops?!

01:03:56.334 --> 01:03:57.292
The thing is,

01:03:58.001 --> 01:04:00.626
even if we do,
there's no law that'll punish him.

01:04:00.626 --> 01:04:03.584
He wasn't defrauding you anyway.

01:04:03.792 --> 01:04:04.501
What?

01:04:04.501 --> 01:04:06.292
I know how you feel.

01:04:06.292 --> 01:04:08.292
But that's the law.

01:04:08.292 --> 01:04:10.792
He can't be arrested over some lies.

01:04:11.792 --> 01:04:15.251
Think of it as a bad luck and let it go.

01:04:16.209 --> 01:04:19.542
So easy for you to say!

01:04:21.626 --> 01:04:24.542
I'll talk to Ahreum about it.

01:04:24.584 --> 01:04:27.084
I'll say she went to USA for treatment.

01:04:28.126 --> 01:04:31.084
Mira, don't worry.

01:04:31.751 --> 01:04:35.209
Just keep it between us.

01:04:59.251 --> 01:05:00.459
Play after lunch.

01:05:00.459 --> 01:05:01.792
I'll eat later.

01:05:02.084 --> 01:05:03.959
It's past your pill time.

01:05:03.959 --> 01:05:05.542
I'll be done soon.

01:05:06.876 --> 01:05:08.751
It's already been <i>2</i> hours. Stop playing!

01:05:08.751 --> 01:05:10.417
Just let me be!

01:05:10.417 --> 01:05:11.709
Leave me alone!

01:05:16.251 --> 01:05:17.792
What do you think you're doing!

01:05:17.917 --> 01:05:20.584
I told you I'll eat later!

01:05:22.584 --> 01:05:24.209
Put that away!

01:05:26.292 --> 01:05:27.209
Do you not hear me?

01:05:27.459 --> 01:05:28.626
Let me be!

01:05:31.584 --> 01:05:34.084
What's the point of eating?

01:05:34.084 --> 01:05:35.542
I'm gonna die anyway!

01:05:37.251 --> 01:05:40.834
Have I ever disobeyed you?

01:05:41.042 --> 01:05:44.876
I just want to do things my way before dying,

01:05:46.251 --> 01:05:50.667
this is what I want to do right now.

01:05:51.126 --> 01:05:53.959
Why can't I just play this?

01:05:54.459 --> 01:05:56.709
I won't live very long...

01:07:08.751 --> 01:07:09.667
Off to work.

01:07:09.667 --> 01:07:10.709
Dad.

01:07:11.792 --> 01:07:14.042
Can I ride with you today?

01:07:14.292 --> 01:07:16.959
I want to see the stars from the Sky Park.

01:07:17.209 --> 01:07:18.834
No.

01:07:19.626 --> 01:07:21.292
Dad...

01:07:32.292 --> 01:07:36.459
I wrote her a final e-mail.

01:07:39.626 --> 01:07:43.292
"Dear Suh-ha..."

01:07:43.292 --> 01:07:46.001
"Good bye."

01:07:54.084 --> 01:07:57.501
Ahreum! Ahreum, don't run!

01:07:58.376 --> 01:07:59.501
Ahreum!

01:08:10.209 --> 01:08:11.959
What's with you today?

01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:19.709
Ahreum?

01:08:21.001 --> 01:08:21.792
Why are you crying?

01:08:22.167 --> 01:08:25.167
Did something happen? Look at me.

01:08:26.376 --> 01:08:29.917
I'm just so happy, that's all.

01:08:29.959 --> 01:08:33.542
What do you mean?

01:08:34.417 --> 01:08:37.417
I'm so happy about everything.

01:09:14.626 --> 01:09:16.334
- Son.
- Yeah, dad?

01:09:16.334 --> 01:09:18.626
How much longer?

01:09:19.292 --> 01:09:21.292
Be patient.

01:09:23.876 --> 01:09:24.709
There! Look!

01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:26.334
Where?!

01:09:26.334 --> 01:09:28.334
I missed it!

01:09:30.334 --> 01:09:34.751
There'll be another.
This is only the beginning.

01:09:34.751 --> 01:09:37.001
Look! There it is!

01:09:37.001 --> 01:09:37.834
- Did you see?
- Yeah!

01:09:38.334 --> 01:09:41.626
Wow, I haven't seen one in so long.

01:09:42.376 --> 01:09:44.751
A dying star's final shine...

01:09:45.959 --> 01:09:47.709
Did you make a wish?

01:09:48.084 --> 01:09:50.417
No, I forgot.

01:09:51.126 --> 01:09:54.751
It'll fall again, make a wish then.

01:09:54.959 --> 01:09:56.876
Okay. Did you make a wish?

01:09:57.167 --> 01:09:59.042
I already did.

01:09:59.042 --> 01:10:00.334
For what?

01:10:00.334 --> 01:10:02.751
It's a secret.

01:10:05.084 --> 01:10:09.584
I feel so happy being here with you,

01:10:10.167 --> 01:10:12.251
watching the stars.

01:10:12.417 --> 01:10:20.084
I'm especially happy that you're my father.

01:10:21.751 --> 01:10:27.126
Me too. I'm so happy you're my son.

01:10:30.959 --> 01:10:35.834
Good kids like you should never be sick.

01:10:38.501 --> 01:10:41.876
Look! Another one! Let me make a wish.

01:11:04.584 --> 01:11:05.876
Should we go?

01:11:06.334 --> 01:11:07.959
I'm starving now.

01:11:09.501 --> 01:11:11.709
What's wrong, not feeling well?

01:11:13.251 --> 01:11:14.084
Dad...

01:11:14.376 --> 01:11:16.459
I can't see.

01:11:17.876 --> 01:11:19.126
What do you mean?

01:11:22.834 --> 01:11:24.126
You can't see anything?

01:11:26.376 --> 01:11:27.834
Nothing.

01:11:28.251 --> 01:11:32.626
Bright stars in the night sky,
the shooting stars...

01:11:33.334 --> 01:11:38.459
and my dad's face were the last things

01:11:38.459 --> 01:11:40.459
I ever saw.

01:11:41.334 --> 01:11:42.667
I'm sorry.

01:11:43.251 --> 01:11:44.959
Why are you sorry, you idiot!

01:11:45.501 --> 01:11:48.042
I should be giving you piggyback rides
at my age.

01:11:48.876 --> 01:11:51.584
Stop it, we're almost there!

01:11:54.876 --> 01:11:56.001
One moment!

01:12:10.792 --> 01:12:13.667
Is he okay? Why isn't he waking up?

01:12:13.709 --> 01:12:15.459
Don't worry too much.

01:12:15.459 --> 01:12:17.917
His body was weak,
so we gave him some sedatives.

01:12:18.292 --> 01:12:21.459
How could he not see so suddenly?

01:12:22.167 --> 01:12:25.792
These geriatric illnesses come
without a warning.

01:12:26.334 --> 01:12:29.084
Retinal artery got blocked.

01:12:29.376 --> 01:12:34.501
High level of stress could've affected
the intraocular pressure.

01:12:34.959 --> 01:12:39.834
Mrs. Han, has Ahreum experienced
any psychological traumas recently?

01:12:44.001 --> 01:12:47.209
- I couldn't do anything...
- Shut the hell up!

01:12:51.001 --> 01:12:52.459
Where does he live?

01:13:13.042 --> 01:13:14.959
"A Boy with Progeria Talk of Town"

01:13:14.959 --> 01:13:16.209
"Boy in Old Man's Skin"

01:13:16.917 --> 01:13:21.126
"Traces of Time (Working Title)"

01:13:24.584 --> 01:13:26.417
"Characters: Ahreum (m, 16),"

01:13:26.417 --> 01:13:28.376
"Suh-ha (f, 1 a)"

01:13:37.209 --> 01:13:39.417
What the hell? Who are you?!

01:13:44.792 --> 01:13:48.042
Why did you do it? Why did you pick my son?!

01:13:48.167 --> 01:13:50.542
To a dying kid!

01:13:52.126 --> 01:13:52.709
I'm sorry.

01:13:54.292 --> 01:13:55.834
I'm so sorry.

01:14:01.001 --> 01:14:01.584
Get up!

01:14:05.834 --> 01:14:09.709
- You son of a bitch...
- I'm so sorry...

01:14:14.417 --> 01:14:17.584
why! why! why!

01:14:35.834 --> 01:14:36.834
Yeah...

01:14:38.209 --> 01:14:43.376
I really thought I had talent,
I couldn't give that up...

01:14:44.667 --> 01:14:46.001
I'm sorry.

01:14:47.084 --> 01:14:48.626
It's all my fault.

01:14:50.376 --> 01:14:53.251
I wouldn't be like this,

01:14:53.251 --> 01:14:55.209
if I wasn't a cripple.

01:14:55.334 --> 01:14:59.292
You got a really great son.

01:15:00.209 --> 01:15:03.459
I'm not saying this because he's my son,

01:15:03.459 --> 01:15:06.126
but Ahreum is incredibly smart.

01:15:06.459 --> 01:15:08.917
People say, you'll feel full

01:15:08.917 --> 01:15:10.292
when seeing your child eat.

01:15:10.501 --> 01:15:11.667
I finally realized what it meant

01:15:11.667 --> 01:15:14.167
when I saw Ahreum grow up.

01:15:15.584 --> 01:15:21.084
Seeing him read a book made me feel smarter.

01:15:22.417 --> 01:15:24.459
He writes so damn well too.

01:15:26.584 --> 01:15:28.709
This is a poem he wrote.

01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:31.334
Titled 'Father', it's about me.

01:15:32.334 --> 01:15:36.251
Movie director? Fuck that. Read it.

01:15:36.959 --> 01:15:39.792
He writes so much better than you, dipshit.

01:15:41.084 --> 01:15:44.001
Titled, 'Father'.

01:15:47.126 --> 01:15:48.959
My father asked me,

01:15:50.001 --> 01:15:53.751
'what do you want to be if you're born again?'

01:15:55.501 --> 01:15:57.876
I answered loudly,

01:15:59.292 --> 01:16:04.417
'father, I want to be a father.'

01:16:05.542 --> 01:16:07.376
My father asked me,

01:16:08.417 --> 01:16:12.876
'there are better things to be,
why do you want to be me?'

01:16:13.751 --> 01:16:16.709
I answered quietly...

01:17:17.459 --> 01:17:18.501
Who is it?

01:18:01.084 --> 01:18:03.334
You've gotten old, father.

01:18:04.751 --> 01:18:08.626
You're a man now.

01:18:12.251 --> 01:18:14.001
Are you in good health?

01:18:15.667 --> 01:18:18.542
Nothing's broken yet.

01:18:29.584 --> 01:18:30.667
"Rare Disease Boy"

01:18:30.667 --> 01:18:31.626
"With a Body of an 80-Year Old"

01:18:32.792 --> 01:18:34.001
It's an anonymous donation.

01:18:34.001 --> 01:18:35.001
"Today Bank, Han Ahreum, acc #3120049..."

01:18:35.167 --> 01:18:36.709
This is $10,000!

01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:38.084
Who would do this?

01:18:38.084 --> 01:18:39.251
Who knows?

01:18:47.251 --> 01:18:54.167
I heard progeria patients only live 10 years.

01:18:55.792 --> 01:18:58.334
But he took after your good health

01:18:59.251 --> 01:19:01.376
and lived this long.

01:19:07.751 --> 01:19:09.584
I'm sorry, father.

01:19:12.667 --> 01:19:13.959
I'm sorry.

01:19:20.292 --> 01:19:21.751
Would you like a smoke?

01:19:24.167 --> 01:19:25.751
Yes, please.

01:19:38.876 --> 01:19:45.001
I had you when I was your age.

01:19:49.667 --> 01:19:51.917
It's a good age.

01:19:54.542 --> 01:19:57.584
So much to live for.

01:20:00.042 --> 01:20:06.084
Watching the program,
I worried about my own son first.

01:20:20.167 --> 01:20:21.376
Dae-su...

01:20:23.376 --> 01:20:24.626
Yes, father.

01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:28.584
You did your best...

01:21:05.459 --> 01:21:07.751
It'll be hard for Ahreum,

01:21:08.376 --> 01:21:11.042
but I will come back with Mira soon.

01:21:11.042 --> 01:21:13.751
Sure, drive carefully.

01:21:14.876 --> 01:21:16.042
Here.

01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:30.501
It looked like my grandson likes hats.

01:21:49.709 --> 01:21:50.667
Go inside.

01:21:51.167 --> 01:21:52.376
Sure.

01:22:44.876 --> 01:22:46.501
You're back?

01:22:55.042 --> 01:22:56.501
Why aren't you eating?

01:22:58.251 --> 01:23:01.209
- Mira.
- Eat first.

01:23:15.667 --> 01:23:18.209
Ma'am, a bottle of soju please!

01:23:18.459 --> 01:23:19.959
Mira, you shouldn't drink.

01:23:20.584 --> 01:23:23.376
I know, I'll just take a sip.

01:23:24.084 --> 01:23:25.917
Have a great meal.

01:23:38.209 --> 01:23:40.501
- Dae-su?
- Yeah?

01:23:41.417 --> 01:23:45.042
Please stop going to work.

01:23:46.334 --> 01:23:47.959
I have to keep earning.

01:23:51.292 --> 01:23:57.584
Stay by Ahreum's side, even a little bit more.

01:24:00.501 --> 01:24:01.792
He...

01:24:04.667 --> 01:24:06.542
doesn't have much time now.

01:24:10.042 --> 01:24:11.834
Don't say that!

01:24:15.001 --> 01:24:16.292
I feel it.

01:24:19.459 --> 01:24:20.959
A mother knows.

01:24:25.501 --> 01:24:27.459
Mira...

01:24:48.834 --> 01:24:50.334
According to Greek myth,

01:24:50.334 --> 01:24:53.542
Hera's breast milk became Milky Way.

01:24:54.251 --> 01:25:01.001
It is commonly known as the pathway
to the next life.

01:25:02.251 --> 01:25:03.876
Wait,

01:25:03.876 --> 01:25:08.084
so the dead gather and live there?

01:25:08.126 --> 01:25:11.001
The Milky Way is known to connect heaven

01:25:11.001 --> 01:25:14.667
and earth at night.

01:25:15.209 --> 01:25:19.626
And at its end lies a place for the dead.

01:25:23.084 --> 01:25:27.376
I hope to see you and dad there.

01:25:28.709 --> 01:25:31.167
But that won't happen.

01:25:34.792 --> 01:25:36.376
Of course it will!

01:25:36.792 --> 01:25:39.626
I believe we'll meet once again.

01:25:40.459 --> 01:25:43.292
We are totally match made in heaven.

01:25:44.209 --> 01:25:45.167
You think so?

01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:47.917
Of course.

01:25:51.209 --> 01:25:58.209
Just because you can't see it,
doesn't mean it's gone, right?

01:26:02.042 --> 01:26:05.001
Stars aren't visible in the day,

01:26:05.501 --> 01:26:07.709
but it's not gone.

01:26:08.876 --> 01:26:12.334
Wait, I heard that somewhere.

01:26:13.542 --> 01:26:16.792
I know I heard it, but where?

01:26:17.667 --> 01:26:19.001
Ahreum?

01:26:19.626 --> 01:26:20.709
Kiddo.

01:26:21.542 --> 01:26:22.834
Afternoon.

01:26:24.834 --> 01:26:26.001
Mr. Jang!

01:26:34.251 --> 01:26:37.709
I'm sorry, I should be the one pushing
you around.

01:26:38.084 --> 01:26:42.334
It's alright, this is a good exercise.

01:26:43.209 --> 01:26:44.792
Chilly hands?

01:26:45.709 --> 01:26:47.126
It's okay.

01:26:48.334 --> 01:26:50.001
- Mr. Jang.
- Yeah?

01:26:50.417 --> 01:26:53.084
- Did something happen?
- No, why?

01:26:53.209 --> 01:26:55.751
You're unusually kind today.

01:26:55.917 --> 01:26:58.042
I got good manners.

01:26:58.042 --> 01:26:59.876
Only for girls and kids.

01:27:02.001 --> 01:27:03.501
Stay still.

01:27:12.459 --> 01:27:13.584
Touch this.

01:27:13.959 --> 01:27:16.084
Wait...this is...

01:27:16.209 --> 01:27:17.459
Yup.

01:27:24.501 --> 01:27:25.417
Drink it.

01:27:25.459 --> 01:27:27.501
Slowly, very slowly.

01:27:32.126 --> 01:27:32.917
How is it?

01:27:34.959 --> 01:27:36.501
It's strong.

01:27:37.834 --> 01:27:39.459
No more regrets now.

01:27:39.667 --> 01:27:42.584
Drink just a bit. I'll drink the rest.

01:27:44.251 --> 01:27:49.584
Dad said drinking
and sad songs go hand-in-hand.

01:27:50.209 --> 01:27:52.084
Could you sing me a song?

01:27:52.251 --> 01:27:56.542
Makes me shuttle booze,
AND demands entertainment?

01:27:59.209 --> 01:28:00.876
Why the hell not?

01:28:04.376 --> 01:28:11.917
As a life runs through a vast field,

01:28:11.917 --> 01:28:18.417
what are you looking for?

01:28:19.251 --> 01:28:22.251
-It's still a life...
- So nice.

01:28:22.501 --> 01:28:26.417
No matter what.

01:28:26.667 --> 01:28:33.584
Money, respect, love, I don't want anything...

01:28:34.501 --> 01:28:37.251
Look, it's snowing!

01:28:41.876 --> 01:28:43.584
First snow!

01:28:46.667 --> 01:28:48.917
Aren't you cold? Shall we go in?

01:28:55.584 --> 01:29:00.376
I'm checking into a senior home
with dad tomorrow.

01:29:01.626 --> 01:29:03.959
I'm growing more forgetful

01:29:03.959 --> 01:29:06.626
and I can't see what's up ahead.

01:29:06.834 --> 01:29:08.709
Take care of yourself, my friend.

01:29:10.292 --> 01:29:12.667
We'll meet again some day.

01:29:42.292 --> 01:29:43.542
He's waking up.

01:29:44.376 --> 01:29:45.584
You're up?

01:29:46.876 --> 01:29:49.959
Honey, it's Christmas.

01:29:51.167 --> 01:29:53.167
Merry Christmas...

01:29:55.001 --> 01:29:58.001
Here's my Christmas gift, look at it.

01:30:01.251 --> 01:30:04.251
Right, I'll read it to you then.

01:30:04.834 --> 01:30:07.751
Today Bank, account holder Han Ahreum.

01:30:08.042 --> 01:30:10.584
$70 deposited on Dec. 7, 2010...

01:30:10.584 --> 01:30:13.792
And 2011, then 2012,

01:30:13.792 --> 01:30:18.376
3-year grand total of $2,597.64.

01:30:18.542 --> 01:30:22.084
This is all under your name,
I'll buy you anything you want.

01:30:22.501 --> 01:30:24.584
Why $70 at a time?

01:30:24.626 --> 01:30:26.084
Lucky 7!

01:30:26.751 --> 01:30:29.417
Do you know how hard it was for me to do this?

01:30:29.709 --> 01:30:31.001
It's a huge deal for a Korean man

01:30:31.001 --> 01:30:33.626
to cut his allowance by $70.

01:30:34.251 --> 01:30:36.001
Yeah, I'm impressed myself.

01:30:36.167 --> 01:30:39.584
I didn't know either. He's the best.

01:30:40.042 --> 01:30:41.459
Anything you want?

01:30:41.626 --> 01:30:44.042
I'll use this to make your wishes come true.

01:30:44.501 --> 01:30:45.459
Just say the word.

01:30:45.792 --> 01:30:47.959
Instead of a gift,

01:30:48.459 --> 01:30:51.001
there's a place I want to go.

01:30:52.542 --> 01:30:54.042
Where is that?

01:30:54.417 --> 01:30:57.417
I want to hear the New Year's Day bell.

01:30:57.959 --> 01:30:59.792
The uptown bell?

01:31:00.501 --> 01:31:02.126
It'll be too crowded.

01:31:02.126 --> 01:31:04.209
Honey, that's a bit much...

01:31:04.209 --> 01:31:06.917
Let's go next time, when you regain.

01:31:06.917 --> 01:31:09.042
Always 'next time'...

01:31:10.001 --> 01:31:12.834
I want to hear it myself this year.

01:31:16.001 --> 01:31:21.001
Can't you make a dying boy's wish come true?

01:31:23.959 --> 01:31:26.459
- And dad?
- Yes?

01:31:26.501 --> 01:31:28.751
On your next visitation,

01:31:29.209 --> 01:31:33.042
could you print a file and bring it?

01:31:34.417 --> 01:31:35.417
Sure.

01:31:35.417 --> 01:31:38.459
The file's called 'Cosmos'.

01:31:39.751 --> 01:31:40.501
I got it.

01:31:40.792 --> 01:31:45.042
Don't read it no matter what.

01:31:45.751 --> 01:31:47.584
Okay, I got it.

01:31:49.084 --> 01:31:50.584
Promise.

01:31:50.834 --> 01:31:53.667
If you read it,

01:31:54.042 --> 01:31:57.542
I'll haunt you forever.

01:31:58.251 --> 01:32:01.751
Come on, you little punk.

01:32:04.417 --> 01:32:05.917
Nasty bugger.

01:32:08.292 --> 01:32:10.084
Excuse me.

01:32:10.084 --> 01:32:13.584
Could you print this file called 'Cosmos'?

01:32:13.584 --> 01:32:14.709
Sure.

01:32:16.917 --> 01:32:18.376
"Lee Suh-ha.hwp"

01:32:20.167 --> 01:32:21.959
Lee Suh-ha?

01:32:32.334 --> 01:32:37.917
When he talked about his days as an athlete,

01:32:38.376 --> 01:32:42.167
he looked the happiest.

01:32:43.084 --> 01:32:47.042
He gave it up for me.

01:32:48.376 --> 01:32:52.167
He never would've imagined,

01:32:52.626 --> 01:32:54.709
that the child he gave

01:32:55.334 --> 01:32:58.001
that up for would grow older than him.

01:32:58.542 --> 01:33:02.667
Ahreum, I got the print out you asked for,
it's in the bag.

01:33:02.667 --> 01:33:04.292
I didn't read it, okay?

01:33:05.334 --> 01:33:06.834
Let me know when you need it.

01:33:07.542 --> 01:33:10.792
Okay, thank you, dad.

01:33:10.792 --> 01:33:14.584
Oh yeah, you got an e-mail from Suh-ha.

01:33:15.751 --> 01:33:17.876
- Suh-ha?
- Yeah.

01:33:18.584 --> 01:33:21.376
Is that so?

01:33:21.876 --> 01:33:23.292
Should I read it for you?

01:33:23.876 --> 01:33:25.042
Okay-

01:33:28.626 --> 01:33:32.042
Ahreum, is Korea really cold now?

01:33:32.792 --> 01:33:37.084
L.A. is really cold too, it's covered in snow.

01:33:38.959 --> 01:33:41.709
I hope we both regain our health

01:33:42.126 --> 01:33:45.542
and see each other in the spring.

01:33:47.334 --> 01:33:48.792
How happy'

01:33:48.792 --> 01:33:52.376
would our parents be?

01:33:54.917 --> 01:33:56.834
I'm feeling much better.

01:33:58.042 --> 01:34:01.376
Careful of the cold, and stay healthy.

01:34:03.167 --> 01:34:07.792
Please don't ever give up hope.

01:34:11.209 --> 01:34:12.501
Good bye for now.

01:34:16.834 --> 01:34:19.959
It snowed even in L.A...

01:34:20.084 --> 01:34:23.209
Yeah, snowed so much.

01:34:23.834 --> 01:34:28.001
Once more, could you read it again?

01:34:29.876 --> 01:34:31.917
Um, sure...

01:34:33.001 --> 01:34:39.584
Ahreum, is it really cold there?
In America...In L.A...

01:34:42.751 --> 01:34:45.626
I got a phone call. I'll be right back.

01:34:46.292 --> 01:34:47.417
Okay-

01:34:56.126 --> 01:34:58.667
Alright, I'm back now.

01:34:59.084 --> 01:35:01.459
I'll read it again.

01:35:01.459 --> 01:35:05.792
Dad, I want to write her back.

01:35:06.459 --> 01:35:09.042
Oh yeah?

01:35:10.292 --> 01:35:14.042
Let me know if I speak too fast.

01:35:14.501 --> 01:35:16.292
Okay, one sec.

01:35:17.251 --> 01:35:21.459
And ask me if you don't know the spelling.

01:35:22.334 --> 01:35:24.709
You're patronizing me again.

01:35:24.876 --> 01:35:26.376
Let's get started.

01:35:26.584 --> 01:35:27.709
Okay-

01:35:31.917 --> 01:35:33.917
Dear Suh-ha.

01:35:35.042 --> 01:35:37.167
Thank you for your e-mail.

01:35:37.626 --> 01:35:43.834
I want to tell you about my childhood.

01:35:44.876 --> 01:35:52.209
According to dad,
I loved peekaboo as a toddler.

01:35:53.167 --> 01:35:58.167
When he appeared behind a door and peekaboo-ed,

01:35:58.459 --> 01:36:03.209
I'd laugh, he'd hide again,

01:36:03.209 --> 01:36:06.792
only to reappear,

01:36:07.084 --> 01:36:09.376
and I'd laugh even harder.

01:36:10.542 --> 01:36:13.126
Can fools like that grow up

01:36:13.584 --> 01:36:18.167
to become scholars and engineers?

01:36:21.209 --> 01:36:22.501
At times,

01:36:23.042 --> 01:36:28.376
I thought I grew up on my own.

01:36:32.209 --> 01:36:34.209
But now I know.

01:36:35.626 --> 01:36:37.959
So many people have raised me,

01:36:38.792 --> 01:36:44.209
and loved me...

01:36:49.042 --> 01:36:54.792
Thinking of all the things my parents
have done for me,

01:36:55.709 --> 01:36:59.084
I am shocked and grateful.

01:37:04.667 --> 01:37:09.959
I won't be able to write e-mails for a while.

01:37:12.292 --> 01:37:15.251
Even if you don't see me,

01:37:16.792 --> 01:37:21.417
even if I say 'peekaboo' and disappear,

01:37:23.417 --> 01:37:25.417
please don't forget me.

01:37:27.709 --> 01:37:29.542
One more thing.

01:37:32.001 --> 01:37:34.459
Never be sad for me.

01:37:37.542 --> 01:37:41.251
As always, good luck.

01:37:49.209 --> 01:37:51.001
All done.

01:37:54.042 --> 01:37:55.542
Oh, okay.

01:38:04.501 --> 01:38:09.876
Although I could not see him,
I knew he was crying.

01:38:11.792 --> 01:38:13.542
He's a kind soul.

01:38:16.459 --> 01:38:19.126
Mr. Han, I can't allow this!

01:38:19.292 --> 01:38:21.792
I'm begging you, please discharge him.

01:38:21.876 --> 01:38:23.792
I can't do that, he...

01:38:25.251 --> 01:38:26.584
You know how dangerous this is.

01:38:26.584 --> 01:38:29.584
We're only buying time here!

01:38:31.834 --> 01:38:33.917
In his final moment,

01:38:35.251 --> 01:38:38.042
I want the 3 of us to be together.

01:38:39.292 --> 01:38:42.417
I'll do anything for Ahreum without hesitation.

01:38:43.126 --> 01:38:44.459
That's me.

01:38:46.209 --> 01:38:50.042
As someone my son admires,

01:38:50.042 --> 01:38:52.626
we'll make sure no harm comes to you.

01:38:55.667 --> 01:38:57.959
I'll sign a waiver if I have to.

01:39:00.834 --> 01:39:02.167
Please, doctor.

01:39:10.876 --> 01:39:16.917
Ahreum, have a safe trip and see you next year.

01:39:17.667 --> 01:39:18.667
Okay-

01:39:47.167 --> 01:39:48.584
So much traffic.

01:39:51.292 --> 01:39:52.959
Rest your head on my lap.

01:39:56.917 --> 01:39:59.417
You'll grow a year older very soon.

01:40:00.167 --> 01:40:03.251
My heyday's over...

01:40:08.959 --> 01:40:11.209
You smell so nice.

01:40:16.459 --> 01:40:19.001
- Mom?
- Yeah?

01:40:19.667 --> 01:40:25.251
Tell my little brother something for me.

01:40:26.501 --> 01:40:32.876
That his brother put a hand on his head.

01:40:37.751 --> 01:40:39.542
You knew?

01:40:40.292 --> 01:40:41.709
Yeah...

01:40:43.876 --> 01:40:47.959
The night dad and I watched the shooting stars,

01:40:48.501 --> 01:40:50.709
I made a wish.

01:40:52.209 --> 01:40:57.042
I wished for my brother's health.

01:41:00.251 --> 01:41:01.834
I'm sorry, Ahreum.

01:41:02.001 --> 01:41:04.584
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

01:41:05.542 --> 01:41:07.042
I know...

01:41:10.334 --> 01:41:11.251
Mom...

01:41:12.917 --> 01:41:14.584
My bag...

01:41:15.751 --> 01:41:17.167
What do you need?

01:41:17.292 --> 01:41:22.876
I have a gift for you...

01:41:29.292 --> 01:41:30.459
I wanted to...

01:41:30.459 --> 01:41:32.126
"That Brilliant Summer"

01:41:32.626 --> 01:41:35.334
give it to you on my 17th birthday...

01:41:37.209 --> 01:41:40.959
But make it my New Year's Day gift.

01:41:43.417 --> 01:41:45.084
Read it now.

01:41:45.876 --> 01:41:47.917
So I can listen too.

01:41:59.876 --> 01:42:01.501
That Brilliant Summer.

01:42:02.334 --> 01:42:03.751
By Han Ahreum.

01:42:09.709 --> 01:42:13.209
The wind is blowing.

01:42:13.209 --> 01:42:15.626
Trees feel the wind the best.

01:42:16.042 --> 01:42:21.667
They greet with their branches
and welcome a new season.

01:42:23.834 --> 01:42:25.459
The wind is blowing.

01:42:26.667 --> 01:42:30.751
Dad knows that windy day is the best day

01:42:30.751 --> 01:42:32.917
to find one's mate.

01:42:39.251 --> 01:42:40.959
Hey!

01:42:41.417 --> 01:42:44.542
Just send me one girlfriend!

01:42:44.792 --> 01:42:46.126
You up there!

01:42:51.584 --> 01:42:54.834
Wishes come true, my ass.

01:42:58.042 --> 01:42:59.584
HOT dang!

01:43:21.459 --> 01:43:23.001
The wind is blowing.

01:43:25.542 --> 01:43:31.542
On this windy day, mom knows she has to leave.

01:43:49.167 --> 01:43:50.584
Shit...

01:43:51.042 --> 01:43:53.751
Bus stop is supposed to be this way.

01:43:54.501 --> 01:43:56.042
Maybe not?

01:44:12.334 --> 01:44:14.251
Gosh!

01:44:53.876 --> 01:44:57.959
Only a moment ago, he was wishing for a girl,

01:44:58.709 --> 01:45:01.334
and now he couldn't believe his eyes.

01:45:04.042 --> 01:45:08.292
'She's pretty,' he thought.

01:45:09.084 --> 01:45:13.542
'Who the hell?' mom thought,
and kept her distance.

01:45:13.542 --> 01:45:14.917
Who are you?

01:45:17.001 --> 01:45:20.584
Mom, do you like it?

01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:24.459
Dad, which part made you laugh?

01:45:25.251 --> 01:45:29.251
That summer, they talked so much.

01:45:30.376 --> 01:45:33.292
It was the natural order of things,

01:45:33.834 --> 01:45:36.709
and they didn't have much else to do.

01:45:37.084 --> 01:45:40.084
Do you know that there're stars
even during the day?

01:45:40.334 --> 01:45:41.917
- Yeah?
- Yup.

01:45:42.126 --> 01:45:43.709
Stars are there day

01:45:43.709 --> 01:45:45.209
or night,

01:45:45.209 --> 01:45:48.626
but due to sunlight, they're not visible now.

01:45:49.167 --> 01:45:50.459
Seriously?

01:45:50.876 --> 01:45:54.292
You must be really good in science.

01:45:54.876 --> 01:45:55.876
Sure.

01:45:56.292 --> 01:46:02.751
So the shooting stars fall even during the day?

01:46:04.251 --> 01:46:08.376
Those...only fall at night...

01:46:10.334 --> 01:46:12.501
- Mira.
- Yeah?

01:46:13.084 --> 01:46:14.209
Choi Mira.

01:46:15.167 --> 01:46:16.209
What?

01:46:16.917 --> 01:46:18.459
Sing me a song.

01:46:18.959 --> 01:46:20.501
No way!

01:46:20.792 --> 01:46:23.959
You said your dream is to be a singer.

01:46:24.126 --> 01:46:25.584
Whatever!

01:46:26.376 --> 01:46:27.917
Just once.

01:46:29.001 --> 01:46:30.542
It's embarrassing.

01:46:30.834 --> 01:46:34.626
When I look into your eyes,

01:46:34.626 --> 01:46:38.167
I can feel your warmth.

01:46:38.167 --> 01:46:42.626
I was speechless, by the sight of you.

01:46:42.626 --> 01:46:46.167
The wind blew.

01:46:47.167 --> 01:46:50.292
Ripples formed on water surface.

01:46:51.084 --> 01:46:55.834
Like countless wrinkles

01:46:55.834 --> 01:47:00.126
from laughing wholeheartedly.

01:47:19.167 --> 01:47:25.376
She pulled back from their kiss,
and looked into the distance.

01:47:32.626 --> 01:47:34.001
What's wrong?

01:47:35.959 --> 01:47:37.376
It's nothing.

01:47:38.126 --> 01:47:44.042
As if the wind knew it was not 'nothing',

01:47:44.542 --> 01:47:49.834
it caressed Mira and Dae-su's heads.

01:47:51.751 --> 01:47:54.542
We wanted that,

01:47:54.959 --> 01:47:58.709
we really needed it then.

01:47:59.834 --> 01:48:02.459
We loved it so much.

01:48:04.709 --> 01:48:07.876
Dad...mom...

01:48:09.459 --> 01:48:11.542
I'll miss you...

01:48:14.376 --> 01:48:19.792
It was the start of high summer...

01:48:24.042 --> 01:48:25.792
It's amazing.

01:48:25.917 --> 01:48:28.126
Did you really write this?

01:48:29.167 --> 01:48:30.792
Awesome.

01:48:38.084 --> 01:48:39.584
Ahreum?

01:48:43.042 --> 01:48:43.667
Ahreum?

01:48:45.792 --> 01:48:46.834
Ahreum!

01:48:48.501 --> 01:48:50.417
Ahreum, wake up!

01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:52.209
Honey, wake up!

01:48:53.626 --> 01:48:54.751
Ahreum...

01:48:55.626 --> 01:48:56.917
ope" Your eyes, honey!

01:49:00.376 --> 01:49:02.042
Wake up, sweetheart!

01:49:04.334 --> 01:49:05.542
Dae-su, what do I do?

01:49:06.084 --> 01:49:09.126
Ahreum! Ahreum!

01:49:09.251 --> 01:49:11.834
Dae-su, do something!

01:49:12.959 --> 01:49:18.167
Ahreum, please open your eyes!

01:49:18.334 --> 01:49:21.001
5!4!3!

01:49:21.459 --> 01:49:23.001
2!1!

01:49:37.876 --> 01:49:40.667
You wanted to hear the bell!

01:49:42.584 --> 01:49:44.167
Ahreum!

01:49:50.626 --> 01:49:51.917
Honey!

01:49:59.251 --> 01:50:00.876
Please no!

01:50:15.876 --> 01:50:17.292
Honey...

01:50:21.501 --> 01:50:23.751
Please don't go!

01:50:41.626 --> 01:50:43.209
Okay, here it is.

01:50:46.001 --> 01:50:48.167
Titled, 'Father'.

01:50:49.792 --> 01:50:51.626
My father asked me,

01:50:52.334 --> 01:50:56.084
'what do you want to be if you're born again?'

01:50:57.542 --> 01:50:59.751
I answered quietly,

01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:05.084
'father, I want to be a father.'

01:51:06.376 --> 01:51:08.209
My father asked me,

01:51:08.792 --> 01:51:13.001
'there are better things to be,
Why'd you want to be me?'

01:51:15.001 --> 01:51:18.459
I answered quietly,

01:51:19.251 --> 01:51:25.417
'father, if I become a father,
have a kid like me

01:51:26.001 --> 01:51:29.417
then I'll understand
what it feels like to be you.'

01:51:30.751 --> 01:51:32.626
Father cries.

01:51:45.751 --> 01:51:49.334
Ms. Kim, that's the end of it!

01:51:52.209 --> 01:51:53.584
That was so good, my son!

01:51:53.584 --> 01:51:54.834
- Good job.
- Come here!

01:51:57.417 --> 01:52:00.084
Is that it? Can we leave?

01:52:00.084 --> 01:52:01.251
Of course!

01:52:01.584 --> 01:52:03.667
- Great job.
- Let's go.

01:52:03.834 --> 01:52:05.751
- Take care.
- Bye for now.

01:52:05.751 --> 01:52:07.917
- Bye!
- Good job!

01:52:10.501 --> 01:52:12.209
Mom, I'm starving.

01:52:12.209 --> 01:52:14.459
What should we eat?

01:52:15.305 --> 01:52:21.301
