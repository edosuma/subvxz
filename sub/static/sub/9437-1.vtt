WEBVTT

01:39.544 --> 01:41.034
What are you doing there, fella?

01:44.549 --> 01:46.244
I just cut these.

01:49.254 --> 01:50.551
You better come along with us.

02:10.441 --> 02:12.068
Taking it off here, Boss.

02:12.777 --> 02:14.438
Yeah, take it off, Dragline.

02:22.787 --> 02:25.278
-Wiping it off here, Boss?
-All right, Koko, wipe it off.

02:26.090 --> 02:27.785
Drinking it up here, Boss.

02:28.459 --> 02:30.359
All right, drink it up, Gambler.

03:03.494 --> 03:05.121
You eyeballing there, Society?

03:05.496 --> 03:06.827
Checking my yo-yo, Boss.

03:19.010 --> 03:20.341
Drag, new-meat bus.

03:26.517 --> 03:29.008
Bunch. Must be half a dozen new-meat.

03:32.523 --> 03:34.150
No more than five, for a cold drink.

04:15.066 --> 04:16.897
All right, you men get lined up there.

04:18.403 --> 04:20.394
Dogboy, shut them dogs up.

04:20.904 --> 04:23.066
They just smell new-meat, s'all, Boss.

04:30.214 --> 04:32.079
What did they bring us today?

04:38.222 --> 04:41.919
Gibson, 507 manslaughter.

04:42.593 --> 04:44.220
Good for a two spot.

04:44.929 --> 04:46.863
It was an accident.
I've never been in trouble before.

04:46.931 --> 04:48.228
You call the Captain, "Captain."

04:48.599 --> 04:51.932
Edgar Potter, 302 and resisting arrest.

04:52.937 --> 04:54.097
One year.

04:54.439 --> 04:56.304
I was trying to keep in
out of the rain.

04:57.742 --> 05:00.233
Get the wax out of your ears.
You call the Captain, "Captain."

05:01.446 --> 05:03.437
And you call the rest of us "Boss,"
you hear?

05:04.615 --> 05:07.948
This man is going to make us
proud of him, Mr. Hunnicutt.

05:09.554 --> 05:10.851
Raymond Pratt.

05:11.756 --> 05:12.745
Yes, Captain.

05:13.124 --> 05:15.251
Breaking, entering, and assault.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.257
Five spot.

05:17.862 --> 05:18.726
And a seaman.

05:19.964 --> 05:22.296
'Spect that should come in real handy
around here, Captain.

05:22.967 --> 05:23.899
Maybe.

05:24.235 --> 05:25.862
Lucas Jackson.

05:26.371 --> 05:27.133
Here, Captain.

05:27.271 --> 05:30.968
Maliciously destroying municipal
property while under the influence.

05:31.275 --> 05:32.765
What was that?

05:34.779 --> 05:36.770
Cutting the heads off
parking meters, Captain.

05:40.485 --> 05:42.112
We ain't never had
one of them before.

05:42.186 --> 05:43.881
Where do you think that's
going to get you?

05:44.655 --> 05:46.486
I guess you could say
I wasn't thinking, Captain.

05:49.494 --> 05:51.985
It says here that you did
real good in the war.

05:52.296 --> 05:55.288
A Silver Star, Bronze Star,
couple of Purple Hearts...

05:56.667 --> 05:59.295
...Sergeant. Then came out
the same way you went in.

06:00.304 --> 06:01.498
Buck Private.

06:02.306 --> 06:04.706
Like I was just passing time,
Captain.

06:06.177 --> 06:09.305
Well, you got yourself
some time now...two years.

06:11.182 --> 06:12.513
Well, hell, that ain't much.

06:12.583 --> 06:15.177
We got a couple of men here
doing 20 spots.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.681
We got one that's got all of it.

06:18.189 --> 06:22.023
We got all kinds, and you're
going to fit in real good.

06:22.693 --> 06:25.526
Of course, in case you get
rabbit in your blood...

06:25.830 --> 06:29.823
...and you decide to take off for home,
you get a bonus of some time...

06:30.535 --> 06:33.333
...and a set of leg chains to keep
you slowed down just a little bit.

06:33.838 --> 06:37.330
For your own good,
you'll learn the rules.

06:39.343 --> 06:41.334
It's all up to you.

06:42.547 --> 06:47.211
Now I can be a good guy or I can
be one real mean son of a bitch.

06:52.356 --> 06:54.847
It's all up to you.

06:55.860 --> 06:57.122
All right, let's move it.

07:14.946 --> 07:15.970
One at a time. Move it!

07:28.392 --> 07:29.916
Them clothes got
laundry numbers on them.

07:29.994 --> 07:32.326
You remember your number and always
wear the ones that has your number.

07:32.396 --> 07:34.591
Any man forgets his number
spends a night in the box.

07:34.899 --> 07:36.992
These here spoons
you keep with you.

07:37.201 --> 07:39.396
Any man loses his spoon
spends a night in the box.

07:39.770 --> 07:41.761
There's no playing grab-ass
or fighting in the building.

07:42.106 --> 07:44.597
You got a grudge against another man,
you fight him Saturday afternoon.

07:44.909 --> 07:47.776
Any man playing grab-ass or fighting in
the building spends a night in the box.

07:48.279 --> 07:51.407
First bell's at five minutes of eight
when you will get in your bunk.

07:51.782 --> 07:52.908
Last bell is at eight.

07:53.184 --> 07:55.914
Any man not in his bunk at eight
spends the night in the box.

07:56.287 --> 07:58.187
There is no smoking in the prone
position in bed.

07:58.289 --> 08:00.917
To smoke you must have both legs
over the side of your bunk.

08:01.292 --> 08:03.385
Any man caught smoking
prone in bed...

08:03.461 --> 08:04.621
...spends a night in the box.

08:05.129 --> 08:06.118
You get two sheets.

08:06.430 --> 08:08.364
Every Saturday, you put
the clean sheet on the top...

08:08.432 --> 08:09.797
...the top sheet on the bottom...

08:09.967 --> 08:11.798
...the bottom sheet you turn in
to the laundry boy.

08:12.136 --> 08:14.297
Any man turns in the wrong sheet
spends a night in the box.

08:14.639 --> 08:16.630
No one'll sit in the bunks
with dirty pants on.

08:16.941 --> 08:19.933
Any man with dirty pants on sitting
on the bunks spends a night in the box.

08:20.444 --> 08:23.140
Any man don't bring back his empty
pop bottle spends a night in the box.

08:23.447 --> 08:25.938
Any man loud talking
spends a night in the box.

08:26.817 --> 08:28.944
You got questions, you come to me.

08:29.954 --> 08:33.321
I'm Carr, the floor walker.
I'm responsible for order in here.

08:34.158 --> 08:35.818
Any man don't keep order
spends a night in...

08:36.159 --> 08:37.149
...the box.

08:38.828 --> 08:40.956
I hope you ain't going
to be a hard case.

08:51.676 --> 08:53.906
Ain't but four. What did I tell you?
You owe me a cold drink.

08:53.978 --> 08:54.967
I owe you. I owe you.

09:02.186 --> 09:04.347
Hey, any of you guys from Connecticut?

09:06.457 --> 09:07.424
Forget it.

09:07.792 --> 09:09.282
Wash them up!

09:10.695 --> 09:12.128
Wash them up!

09:21.872 --> 09:24.864
Well, what are you still doing here?
Get at them beans!

09:41.692 --> 09:43.455
Next time you stay out of my place.

09:43.628 --> 09:45.528
You try that again
and I'll bounce you off the floor.

09:45.863 --> 09:47.854
Well, man, I didn't know
it was your special seat.

09:48.199 --> 09:49.689
You don't take another man's seat, man.

09:50.034 --> 09:51.626
It wasn't his fault.
Nobody said anything...

09:51.702 --> 09:55.035
You better mind you manners, boy.
You're acting like a hillbilly tramp.

09:55.506 --> 09:57.167
"Tramp." There you go, Beauty.

09:57.708 --> 09:59.869
Hey, yeah, man, you got
your bull-gang name now.

10:00.544 --> 10:02.705
Yeah, well, it ain't no worse
than some I been called.

10:03.381 --> 10:04.678
When I was in the Navy...

10:04.749 --> 10:05.738
All you new-meats...

10:06.050 --> 10:08.678
...you're going to have to shape up
fast and hard for this gang.

10:08.753 --> 10:10.050
We got rules here.

10:10.154 --> 10:11.052
In order to learn them...

10:11.122 --> 10:13.488
...you gotta do more work
with your ears than your mouth.

10:16.060 --> 10:17.049
Somebody say something?

10:18.229 --> 10:19.890
No, I didn't say nothing, Boss.

10:20.831 --> 10:21.820
What have we got there?

10:22.400 --> 10:23.731
Got a Lucas Jackson.

10:25.403 --> 10:27.735
You don't have a name here
until Dragline gives you one.

10:29.206 --> 10:33.199
Maybe we ought to call it No-Ears.
You don't listen much, do you, boy?

10:33.244 --> 10:35.144
I ain't heard that much
worth listening to.

10:35.246 --> 10:37.737
A lot of guys laying down
a lot of rules and regulations.

10:40.918 --> 10:42.408
New-meat looks like
a poker player, Drag.

10:44.355 --> 10:46.016
Yeah, that wouldn't surprise me none.

10:46.090 --> 10:47.887
I know you've got five dollars
pocket money.

10:47.958 --> 10:50.586
That would buy you a whole fistful
of cards. You in or out?

10:51.762 --> 10:52.751
Out.

11:06.277 --> 11:07.266
First bell.

11:17.788 --> 11:18.948
How'd you get that scar?

11:19.290 --> 11:20.279
What scar?

11:22.460 --> 11:23.449
Last bell.

11:23.794 --> 11:24.954
Last bell.

11:56.160 --> 11:57.320
Fifty, Boss.

11:57.995 --> 11:59.155
Right, Carr. Fifty.

12:10.508 --> 12:11.497
Getting up here, Carr.

13:35.426 --> 13:38.418
Get out of my eyeballing seat,
you new-meat dummy.

14:10.127 --> 14:13.460
I'm a salesman. I used to drive
these roads all the time.

14:14.798 --> 14:16.629
Drag, it's going to be
one hot mother today.

14:18.469 --> 14:20.960
Yeah, I reckon the Bear's going
to be walking the road today.

14:21.305 --> 14:23.136
Then I'm lucky I got me a broom.

14:23.474 --> 14:27.808
I work on top, real cush job. I would
hate to be down in that ditch today.

14:28.145 --> 14:29.305
We work in a ditch?

14:30.981 --> 14:31.970
What's the matter with you?

14:32.316 --> 14:35.479
All your big-time driving around,
you never seen a chain gang before?

14:36.153 --> 14:39.145
I ain't used to hard work, neither.
I always tried to avoid it.

14:39.657 --> 14:41.648
I ain't exactly crazy about it, myself.

14:42.493 --> 14:45.155
Well, man, it's going to be
one tough day to learn on.

14:47.998 --> 14:50.091
Why don't you give one of these
new-meat a break...

14:50.167 --> 14:51.657
...and let him use your broom today?

14:52.002 --> 14:54.835
Oh, hell, Society, I ain't
going down in that ditch.

14:55.172 --> 14:58.335
Well, I sure would appreciate it.
I ain't in too good a shape right now.

14:58.676 --> 15:01.338
Hey, Koko,
you really going to sell your job?

15:01.679 --> 15:03.169
Well, Drag, I may have to.

15:04.181 --> 15:06.342
Maybe that Lucas War Hero
would give you your price.

15:06.684 --> 15:08.174
I'll give you 50 cents.

15:08.519 --> 15:12.182
Fifty cents for a sweet job like that?
That's worth at least a buck.

15:12.856 --> 15:13.845
I'll make it a dollar.

15:14.191 --> 15:15.180
Dollar's a deal.

15:19.863 --> 15:22.024
Where'd you get that about war hero?

15:22.366 --> 15:24.334
A little birdie told me.

15:24.401 --> 15:26.164
Tearing the heads off of...what was it?

15:26.370 --> 15:27.860
Gumball machines?

15:28.405 --> 15:30.896
What kind of thing
is that for a grown man?

15:32.710 --> 15:36.202
You know how it is. Small town.
Not much to do in the evening.

15:38.215 --> 15:40.376
Mostly was just settling an old score.

15:57.234 --> 16:00.067
Boss, I made this arrangement
with this man to take his broom.

16:04.575 --> 16:06.566
-You don't understand, I made this deal.
-Get moving.

16:07.745 --> 16:09.076
But I made this arrangement.

16:13.083 --> 16:14.414
Get to work.

16:33.937 --> 16:37.395
Better take it easy.
You won't last two hours.

16:40.778 --> 16:42.439
Taking it off here, Boss?

16:42.780 --> 16:44.771
Yeah, Dragline, take it off there.

16:44.815 --> 16:47.079
-Taking it off here, Boss?
-Take it off.

16:49.119 --> 16:50.108
Drinking it up here, Boss?

17:05.469 --> 17:06.800
Man bear-clawed here, Boss!

17:30.661 --> 17:31.685
All right, men.

17:32.162 --> 17:33.652
Let's eat them beans!

17:49.680 --> 17:51.170
Cold drink he don't make it.

17:53.851 --> 17:54.943
He won't.

17:55.185 --> 17:57.176
Hey, Babalugats, got a bet here.

18:22.146 --> 18:25.479
-Boss, drinking it up here.
-Right.

18:31.121 --> 18:32.110
Who's that?

18:32.823 --> 18:33.812
That's Godfrey.

18:34.791 --> 18:35.951
The Walking Boss.

18:49.139 --> 18:50.299
Don't he ever talk?

18:55.078 --> 18:56.739
Think he just said somethin'.

19:33.350 --> 19:35.511
You owe that fella a cold drink.

19:51.535 --> 19:52.365
All right!

19:52.869 --> 19:55.269
You, Gibson, step out.

19:56.873 --> 19:59.205
Boss Paul says you wasn't
happy with your job.

20:00.043 --> 20:01.203
Says you was complaining.

20:02.045 --> 20:04.536
Well, we going to give you
a chance to think about it.

20:05.048 --> 20:06.037
All right.

20:06.183 --> 20:07.548
Let's go.

20:16.393 --> 20:17.724
Get them clothes off.

21:16.420 --> 21:17.409
First bell.

21:20.290 --> 21:24.784
Plumb busted out. Looks like the hard
road finally got to Mr. Lucas War Hero.

21:25.462 --> 21:27.623
I'll be back at it in the morning.
Just need a little nap.

21:27.964 --> 21:30.455
Man, I never thought they'd put him
in the box on his first day.

21:31.802 --> 21:33.292
It was only supposed to be a joke.

21:34.971 --> 21:36.461
There ain't no brooms.

21:36.807 --> 21:38.798
Well, can't expect to learn
everything the first day.

21:40.310 --> 21:42.301
They've taught him
a very valuable lesson.

21:44.815 --> 21:46.806
You guys sure give him
all night to think about it.

21:47.651 --> 21:49.983
We can't help it if he's square.
Huh, Drag?

21:50.654 --> 21:54.988
Of course not. He ain't in the box
because of a joke played on him.

21:55.659 --> 21:57.820
He back-sassed a free man.

21:58.495 --> 22:01.157
They got their rules and we
ain't got nothing to do with that.

22:02.332 --> 22:05.665
Probably happen to him sooner or
later anyway, complainer like him.

22:06.503 --> 22:09.336
He's gotta learn the rules,
same as anybody else.

22:10.841 --> 22:13.503
Yeah, them poor old bosses need
all the help they can get.

22:14.845 --> 22:15.834
Trying to say something?

22:21.818 --> 22:22.944
Last bell!

22:24.388 --> 22:25.514
Last bell!

22:27.357 --> 22:29.689
One of these days I'm gonna have to
flap me up some dust with it.

22:30.193 --> 22:35.756
-Forty-nine and one in the box, Boss.
-Right, Carr, 49 and one in the box.

23:07.964 --> 23:09.261
Putting them on here, Boss.

23:11.902 --> 23:13.392
You see that, you see that?

23:13.470 --> 23:14.698
I got eyes, don't I?

23:14.771 --> 23:17.467
How am I not going to see someone
that looks like that?

23:21.411 --> 23:22.901
Man, oh, man, look at that.
Look at that!

23:32.456 --> 23:34.617
-Wipin' it off here, Boss.
-Wipe it off.

23:43.400 --> 23:45.197
-Taking them off here, Boss?
-All right.

23:46.269 --> 23:48.260
Damn thing's blocking the scenery.

23:51.942 --> 23:54.604
Oh man, I'm dying. I'm dying!

24:02.719 --> 24:04.050
Nice broad.

24:06.389 --> 24:07.378
Great set.

24:16.666 --> 24:19.294
Lucille, baby.

24:29.212 --> 24:32.340
Oh man, I'm dying! I'm dying!

24:36.319 --> 24:40.153
She ain't got nothing, but...one
safety pin holding that thing on!

24:42.158 --> 24:44.649
Come on, safety pin, pop!

24:47.864 --> 24:49.195
C'mon baby, pop!

24:52.168 --> 24:53.157
Hey, Lord...

24:53.670 --> 24:57.003
...whatever I done, don't strike me
blind for another couple of minutes.

24:59.509 --> 25:00.999
My Lucille.

25:03.179 --> 25:05.340
Your Lucille, boy.
Where did you get that?

25:06.182 --> 25:07.672
That's Lucille, you mother-head.

25:08.184 --> 25:11.347
Anything so innocent,
and built like that...

25:11.688 --> 25:13.349
...just gotta be named Lucille.

25:15.992 --> 25:18.552
Rub it, baby. Clean that car.

25:18.628 --> 25:20.619
Rub...rub...

25:50.226 --> 25:52.217
She don't know what she's doing.

25:52.896 --> 25:55.228
Oh boy, she knows exactly
what she's doing.

25:55.565 --> 25:58.056
She's driving us crazy,
and loving every minute of it!

25:59.069 --> 26:01.401
Shut your mouth about my Lucille.

26:29.099 --> 26:30.430
Shut up, Babalugats.

26:30.767 --> 26:32.200
You leave him alone? He's happy.

26:32.268 --> 26:33.599
Because he's a damn moron!

28:04.060 --> 28:05.721
Oh, man, that little Lucille.

28:06.429 --> 28:10.229
She was really a big
lot of little gal, wasn't she?

28:12.936 --> 28:16.929
Did you see how she was just about
popping out of the top of that dress?

28:17.574 --> 28:19.064
Come on, Drag, cut it out.

28:20.243 --> 28:21.733
And down below...

28:22.445 --> 28:25.073
...man, that thing
didn't reach no higher than...

28:29.085 --> 28:31.747
She's liable to catch a cold
running around like that.

28:32.956 --> 28:36.448
It was stretched so tight
across her bottom...

28:36.960 --> 28:40.896
...I do believe I saw
one of those seams bust loose.

28:42.265 --> 28:44.256
And the opening got wider...

28:45.468 --> 28:46.765
...and wider...and wider.

28:49.272 --> 28:50.261
Forget it, man.

28:52.776 --> 28:53.970
What do you mean, forget it?

28:55.278 --> 28:59.112
Stop beating it into the ground.
You ain't doing nobody no good.

29:01.785 --> 29:04.618
Okay, new-meat. You get some sleep.

29:05.989 --> 29:08.116
And save your strength,
'cause you're going to need it.

29:10.994 --> 29:11.983
Tomorrow.

30:45.388 --> 30:46.878
Why don't you just stay down, Luke?

30:46.956 --> 30:48.719
He's just going to
knock you down again, buddy.

30:49.092 --> 30:50.719
It's not your fault. He's just too big.

30:51.094 --> 30:53.255
Let him hit you in the nose
and get some blood flowing.

30:53.396 --> 30:55.227
Maybe the bosses'll stop it
before he kills you.

30:55.598 --> 30:56.895
I don't want to frighten him.

30:57.367 --> 30:58.493
Stay down, Luke.

31:01.404 --> 31:04.396
Stay down, Luke. He's gonna kill you.

31:47.050 --> 31:48.039
Stay down!

32:06.169 --> 32:08.660
Somebody ought to stop this thing.

32:50.213 --> 32:51.339
Stay down.

32:52.015 --> 32:53.004
You're beat!

32:55.018 --> 32:56.508
You're going to have to kill me.

34:07.557 --> 34:08.922
All right, pass right. Here we go.

34:09.092 --> 34:13.585
King gets a three, queen deuce,
seven pair of savannah's right here.

34:13.929 --> 34:16.922
Deuce gets a four. No hell.
Three gets a big ace.

34:23.438 --> 34:24.428
I call.

34:36.119 --> 34:37.177
Kick a buck.

34:37.253 --> 34:38.550
A dollar?

34:41.623 --> 34:43.524
One time.

34:43.960 --> 34:45.518
All right, I'll call.

34:46.094 --> 34:48.290
Hell, if I catch, I'm gonna
burn you out. I call.

34:49.132 --> 34:51.965
King, three, he got a four.
Queen, deuce gets a five.

34:52.168 --> 34:54.136
Pair of seven gets a john.

34:54.170 --> 34:56.967
And the big ace gets...slop in the face.

34:58.641 --> 35:00.836
Okay, you still do the talking.

35:01.844 --> 35:02.833
Cuter again.

35:03.546 --> 35:04.535
I call.

35:07.917 --> 35:08.906
Kick a buck.

35:12.121 --> 35:13.782
-What you got?
-Pair of sevens.

35:13.856 --> 35:16.848
I can see that, mother-head.
What have you got in the hole?

35:19.162 --> 35:21.153
He ain't got nothing showing.
Raze his head off.

35:21.564 --> 35:22.553
He's been betting...

35:22.765 --> 35:24.733
All right, why don't you call him.

35:26.869 --> 35:28.860
You've got to see it, Gambler.

35:29.172 --> 35:31.106
I can't. I can't catch a damn thing...

35:31.174 --> 35:33.165
I'm snake-bit. I fold.

35:34.877 --> 35:38.176
King, four, three. You got a nine.
You got a nine. Nothing visible.

35:38.881 --> 35:41.042
Pair of sevens and a jack gets a six.

35:41.851 --> 35:43.910
Savannahs, you still a better, man.

35:51.627 --> 35:52.616
Kick a buck.

35:53.029 --> 35:54.587
Kick him back a buck!

35:54.697 --> 35:57.029
I'll see your buck and back a buck.

35:59.569 --> 36:00.558
Kick a buck.

36:00.636 --> 36:01.568
Damn!

36:01.671 --> 36:03.036
Don't look at me, mother-head.

36:06.542 --> 36:09.204
What're you going to do, play like
a coconut? You got to call him.

36:10.413 --> 36:13.041
I know he's got a pair of kings.
You don't have to stuff'em up my nose.

36:13.416 --> 36:15.043
Well, you still got to call him, anyway.

36:17.220 --> 36:19.017
The man's got kings. Get your tail out.

36:23.492 --> 36:25.483
You wanna see him? Right there.

36:31.734 --> 36:33.725
Nothing. Handful of nothing.

36:34.070 --> 36:36.561
You stupid mullet-head,
he beat you with nothing.

36:37.173 --> 36:40.836
Just like today when he kept
coming back at me. With nothing.

36:45.248 --> 36:47.580
Sometimes nothing
can be a real cool hand.

36:51.954 --> 36:52.943
Move over.

36:53.589 --> 36:55.955
I'm going to sit in here
next to my boy.

36:58.261 --> 36:59.956
Cool Hand Luke.

37:25.221 --> 37:26.245
Hey, Loudmouth!

37:27.189 --> 37:29.851
Come on, get up there.
Your mama's waiting for you.

37:32.295 --> 37:33.785
She never leaves me alone!

37:34.630 --> 37:36.495
Be glad you got somebody, kid.

37:36.799 --> 37:38.790
Luke, visitor for you.

38:14.270 --> 38:16.431
-Coming out here, Boss.
-Come out, Luke.

39:08.057 --> 39:09.081
How did you find me?

39:09.625 --> 39:12.287
That Helen...

39:12.661 --> 39:14.993
...she sent your things along
with a note...

39:15.331 --> 39:19.165
...and then John here,
he wrote to the police.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.171
Goin' around here, Boss?

39:30.513 --> 39:32.174
Well, Arletta, I've got to stay here.

39:36.519 --> 39:38.851
I always hoped to see you well-fixed...

39:40.022 --> 39:43.685
...have me a crop of grandkids
to fuss around with.

39:45.194 --> 39:47.321
I'd like to oblige you, Arletta, but...

39:47.530 --> 39:49.862
...right off, I just don't know
where to put my hands on 'em.

39:53.869 --> 39:55.200
You know, sometimes...

39:56.205 --> 39:58.867
...I wish people was like dogs, Luke.

40:01.544 --> 40:04.536
Comes a time, a day like when...

40:05.714 --> 40:09.206
...the bitch just don't recognize
the pups no more, so...

40:11.554 --> 40:16.048
...she don't have no hopes,
nor love to give her pain.

40:19.061 --> 40:20.722
She just don't give a damn.

40:25.901 --> 40:27.391
They letting you smoke here?

40:27.903 --> 40:29.234
Smoking it up here, Boss?

40:37.913 --> 40:39.244
You done your best, Arletta.

40:43.419 --> 40:45.148
What I've done with myself
is my own problem.

40:45.254 --> 40:49.088
Oh, no, it ain't, Luke.
You ain't alone.

40:49.758 --> 40:52.090
Everywhere you go, I'm with you.

40:53.262 --> 40:54.593
And John, too.

40:57.266 --> 40:59.097
You never thought maybe
that's a heavy load?

41:02.104 --> 41:06.268
Why, we always thought you
were strong enough to carry it.

41:08.277 --> 41:09.608
Was we wrong?

41:09.945 --> 41:10.934
I don't know.

41:13.749 --> 41:15.148
Well, things are just
never the way...

41:15.217 --> 41:16.548
...they seem, Arletta, you know that.

41:16.619 --> 41:18.109
A man's gotta go his own way.

41:18.621 --> 41:20.111
Guess, I've just got to...

41:22.124 --> 41:23.955
...got to love you and let go.

41:26.629 --> 41:27.288
I guess.

41:30.466 --> 41:32.957
I ain't asking what you're going to do
when you get out because...

41:33.302 --> 41:36.135
...l'll be dead and it don't matter.

41:40.476 --> 41:42.239
You never did want to live forever.

41:42.311 --> 41:44.142
I mean, it wasn't such a hell of a life.

41:45.814 --> 41:49.147
I had me...some high old times.

41:49.818 --> 41:51.308
Your old man, Luke...

41:52.154 --> 41:54.315
...he wasn't much good
for sticking around...

41:54.657 --> 41:57.649
...but, dammit, he made me laugh.

42:01.163 --> 42:03.495
I would have liked to have known him,
the way you talk about him.

42:15.177 --> 42:16.667
He'd have broke you up.

42:34.196 --> 42:35.857
What went wrong?

42:36.198 --> 42:38.530
Nothing. Everything's cool as can be.

42:41.370 --> 42:43.031
Arletta, I tried.

42:44.206 --> 42:45.195
I mean to...

42:47.376 --> 42:49.537
...live always free and
above board like you, but...

42:50.879 --> 42:53.211
...I don't know, I just can't seem
to find any elbow room.

42:58.554 --> 43:00.886
You always had good jobs.

43:01.890 --> 43:04.882
And that girl in Kentucky.

43:05.227 --> 43:08.390
Oh...l'd taken a shine to her.

43:08.897 --> 43:12.560
She sure took off
with that convertible fella.

43:12.901 --> 43:14.232
Well, why not?

43:15.070 --> 43:19.404
Idea of marrying got you all,
all bollixed up.

43:21.577 --> 43:23.738
Trying to be respectable.

43:25.080 --> 43:28.413
You was boring the hell
out of all of us.

43:38.761 --> 43:40.422
I'm leaving the place to John.

43:40.763 --> 43:41.752
That's good. He earned it.

43:42.765 --> 43:44.255
Ain't nothing to do with it.

43:48.103 --> 43:49.934
I just never gave John...

43:52.107 --> 43:54.940
...the kind of, you know,
feeling that I gave you.

43:55.277 --> 43:58.769
So, I'm going to pay him back now.

44:00.849 --> 44:03.841
Don't feel you have to say anything.

44:06.622 --> 44:08.613
The way it is, you see...

44:14.296 --> 44:18.630
...sometimes you just
have a feeling for a child...

44:20.636 --> 44:21.967
...or else you don't.

44:23.806 --> 44:25.797
With John, I just didn't.

44:32.147 --> 44:33.478
I gotta go, Arletta.

44:35.651 --> 44:38.313
Laugh it up, kid.
You, you'll make out.

44:48.997 --> 44:52.330
Uncle Luke, why can't you have chains?

44:54.670 --> 44:56.763
John-Boy, let me tell you something.

44:56.839 --> 45:00.172
You know them chains ain't medals.
You got them for making mistakes.

45:01.110 --> 45:04.807
And you make a bad enough mistake,
then you've got to deal with the Man.

45:05.514 --> 45:07.345
And he is one rough old boy.

45:22.097 --> 45:24.088
So long, Arletta. Take care.

45:24.867 --> 45:26.198
You know it, kid.

45:30.873 --> 45:32.704
Now there ain't nothing
to come back for.

45:39.882 --> 45:44.216
"Just a closer walk with Thee.

45:47.890 --> 45:52.554
"Grant it, Jesus, is my plea.

45:56.064 --> 46:00.728
"Daily walking close to Thee.

46:04.239 --> 46:07.572
"Let it be, dear Lord...

46:07.910 --> 46:10.071
"...let it be.

46:13.415 --> 46:17.909
"Through the days of
toil that's near...

46:20.422 --> 46:25.086
"...if I fall, dear Lord, who cares?

46:29.598 --> 46:32.089
"Who but Thee...

46:32.434 --> 46:35.096
"...my burden shares?

46:36.772 --> 46:38.433
"None but Thee...

46:39.041 --> 46:42.374
"...dear Lord, none but Thee!"

47:08.470 --> 47:10.631
This gang's been doing so good...

47:11.974 --> 47:14.465
...the Captain decided
to give you something special.

47:16.945 --> 47:20.278
You've got yourselves
a whole road of tarring to do.

47:22.484 --> 47:24.315
And I want to see you roll it.

47:30.158 --> 47:31.648
Pick up your shovels.

47:32.327 --> 47:33.988
Get with it. Move!

47:37.666 --> 47:39.600
We're sure going to be walking
the road today.

47:39.668 --> 47:40.828
What's the deal?

47:41.003 --> 47:44.837
-Man, you think you been working hard?
-This mother's going to break your back.

48:26.448 --> 48:28.279
Let's move! Let's see those shovels!

48:32.788 --> 48:37.122
Going to twist my arm off if it
don't kill me first. Right, Boss?

48:45.634 --> 48:47.795
Hey, buddy, slow down.

48:48.637 --> 48:50.127
That's a long road.

48:52.140 --> 48:55.803
Well, the man wants speed,
let's just give it to him.

48:56.478 --> 49:00.471
Cram it in and break it out.
Yeah. Go hard.

49:02.317 --> 49:03.978
What are we racing for?

49:05.153 --> 49:07.644
Wants speed, let's give it to him.

49:08.824 --> 49:10.655
Use that shovel like it was your spoon.

49:26.008 --> 49:27.669
The man, boy, get the man!

49:28.010 --> 49:29.170
Moving it up here, Boss.

50:08.717 --> 50:11.208
Now you tell me, Rabbit,
what's going on here?

50:12.054 --> 50:14.716
I don't know, Boss.
Think they're all bear-clawed.

50:22.230 --> 50:24.391
They don't know whether
to smile, spit or swallow.

50:25.067 --> 50:28.400
Well, they've never seen
a bull gang before.

51:43.645 --> 51:44.976
Where'd the road go?

51:45.981 --> 51:48.643
That's it. That's the end of it.

51:49.317 --> 51:50.648
Man, there's still daylight.

51:51.486 --> 51:52.976
About two hours left.

51:54.823 --> 51:56.154
What do we do now?

51:57.826 --> 51:58.815
Nothing.

51:59.661 --> 52:02.994
Oh, Luke, you wild, beautiful thing!

52:04.166 --> 52:06.498
You crazy handful of nothing!

52:27.689 --> 52:29.350
"As Carol pressed her lips to him...

52:30.025 --> 52:34.189
"...his right hand started a slow
descent down her silken body.

52:35.197 --> 52:38.689
"Desire and fear,
temptation and terror...

52:39.367 --> 52:43.201
"...yearning and horror warred
within her beautiful young body."

52:45.874 --> 52:48.536
Have to close those things,
or we'd drown,

52:48.610 --> 52:49.599
but it's suffocating in here.

52:50.879 --> 52:52.210
Talk about drowning.

52:53.381 --> 52:54.939
When I was in the navy...

52:55.016 --> 52:57.712
...I was on submarine duty once,
and when you get down there...

52:58.053 --> 53:00.886
Will you tell your story walkin'?
It's too hot.

53:11.399 --> 53:13.560
Did you see my skinny little boy
chow tonight?

53:13.735 --> 53:15.566
He's matching you plate for plate.

53:16.071 --> 53:19.234
I wasn't feeling good.
I think I got an ulcer or something.

53:20.575 --> 53:23.237
He had a bigger spoon. Make you
look like yours had a hole in it.

53:23.912 --> 53:24.901
Come on, Clarence.

53:25.080 --> 53:27.742
What do you mean, Clarence?
You call me a liar?

53:27.816 --> 53:28.805
No, not a liar.

53:28.883 --> 53:32.410
You just have a common, likeable
tendency toward exaggeration.

53:35.590 --> 53:38.753
That there's the champion
hog-gutter of this camp.

53:39.594 --> 53:41.755
Well, I've seen him eat
ten chocolate bars...

53:42.097 --> 53:44.759
...and seven cold drinks
in 15 minutes.

53:46.101 --> 53:50.094
He can eat busted bottles and
rusty nails, any damn thing.

53:50.438 --> 53:53.771
If you be so kind to let me cut off
your Yankee head, he'll even eat that.

53:56.111 --> 53:57.442
I can eat 50 eggs.

54:02.450 --> 54:03.781
Nobody can eat 50 eggs.

54:04.119 --> 54:05.450
You just said he could eat anything.

54:05.787 --> 54:06.776
You ever eat 50 eggs?

54:07.122 --> 54:08.953
Nobody ever eat 50 eggs.

54:09.291 --> 54:10.952
Hey, Babalugats! We got a bet here.

54:11.793 --> 54:14.785
My boy says he can eat 50 eggs,
he can eat 50 eggs.

54:15.030 --> 54:15.894
Yeah, but in how long?

54:17.666 --> 54:18.826
In an hour.

54:18.967 --> 54:20.958
Well, I believe I'll take part
in that wager.

54:21.303 --> 54:22.463
Two dollars. Right here.

54:22.804 --> 54:24.135
Come on now, let's talk some money.

54:24.472 --> 54:26.303
All right, $20. Anything.

54:26.641 --> 54:28.472
The syndicate will cover any bet
you want to make.

54:28.543 --> 54:29.669
Koko, get some paper.

54:29.811 --> 54:33.144
Drag, 50 eggs got to weigh
a good six pounds.

54:33.481 --> 54:36.473
Man's gut can't hold that.
They'll swell up and bust him open.

54:37.319 --> 54:40.482
All right, get your money up. Now,
Gambler, Dynamite, come on, get it up.

54:40.822 --> 54:43.484
Koko-head's going to take all the money.
Come on, Loudmouth, get it up.

54:43.625 --> 54:45.490
Wait just a minute, now.
How's he gonna eat them?

54:45.694 --> 54:48.026
Boiled for 15 minutes.
Eat the whole thing in an hour.

54:48.330 --> 54:50.491
One rule. No throwing up.

54:50.865 --> 54:53.356
He throws up, you forfeit everything.

54:53.668 --> 54:56.330
Now when was the last time
you ever saw my boy throw up?

54:56.671 --> 54:58.662
Now shut your mouth
and give your money to Koko.

55:05.714 --> 55:08.046
Why did you have to say 50 for?

55:08.350 --> 55:11.513
Why couldn't you say 35 or 39.

55:11.820 --> 55:13.344
It seemed a nice round number.

55:14.022 --> 55:16.684
That's money you're talking about.
What's the matter with you?

55:17.692 --> 55:20.354
Yeah, well, it'll be something to do.

55:26.935 --> 55:28.425
-Ten!
-Ten, right!

55:32.741 --> 55:34.231
What did I do?

55:36.211 --> 55:38.372
I stole and I told lies.

55:40.715 --> 55:43.206
But I loved my neighbor. And his wife.

55:44.219 --> 55:45.208
He'll never make it.

55:48.390 --> 55:51.882
What we've got to do is stretch
that little old belly of yours.

55:53.395 --> 55:55.727
Get all this stuff out of the way.
Them eggs's coming down.

55:58.900 --> 56:01.869
We've got to get it all in fighting
shape, like a barrage balloon.

56:07.008 --> 56:08.236
Ready...

56:09.010 --> 56:10.477
...and go!

56:21.256 --> 56:24.748
Hey, Boss, man needs a brown
bomber and a dose of salts.

56:32.233 --> 56:33.860
You can't do that!

56:36.271 --> 56:39.138
-I want my money back.
-No money back.

56:50.285 --> 56:52.617
Twenty of those pills still won't
make any difference.

56:52.954 --> 56:54.785
What are you worried about?
He can't do it.

56:56.257 --> 56:57.519
What's he doing?

57:36.464 --> 57:39.627
All right, stand back, you pedestrians.
This ain't no automobile accident.

57:39.701 --> 57:40.725
That's all 50?

57:40.802 --> 57:43.134
Move over, losers.
I got money riding here.

57:45.640 --> 57:47.073
All right, I've got it figured out.

57:47.141 --> 57:50.338
If he eats an egg a minute, he's got
ten minutes left to swallow them.

57:50.645 --> 57:53.637
Hey, I just got five bucks
from a rodeo outfit.

57:55.984 --> 57:58.475
-Hey, you're peeling his eggs.
-That's right, mister.

57:58.987 --> 58:00.978
He peels his eggs himself.
That's understood.

58:01.322 --> 58:04.052
Now you may be just great
at hanging paper around the big city...

58:04.125 --> 58:05.149
...and passing bad checks...

58:05.493 --> 58:07.484
...but us country boys
ain't entirely brainless.

58:07.829 --> 58:10.821
When it comes to the law,
nothing is understood.

58:11.165 --> 58:12.996
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

58:13.334 --> 58:16.167
Who made what law
about peeling the eggs?

58:16.504 --> 58:19.337
I'm his trainer. I'm the syndicate
covering all bets.

58:19.674 --> 58:22.507
And I'm his official egg-peeler.
That's the law.

58:27.682 --> 58:29.513
Just wait till the hour starts,
that's all.

58:29.851 --> 58:31.842
I was banking on the fact
he had to peel 'em.

58:34.689 --> 58:35.747
What's going on?

58:45.533 --> 58:46.693
You ready, Champ?

58:52.407 --> 58:53.567
Ready?

58:55.310 --> 58:56.470
Go!

59:00.315 --> 59:01.475
Two...

59:01.916 --> 59:02.905
...three...

59:03.051 --> 59:05.383
Man, he's going to lose a finger
eating eggs like that.

59:14.562 --> 59:15.824
Twenty-four...

59:21.603 --> 59:22.695
...twenty-five...

59:22.770 --> 59:23.759
Slow down a little.

59:28.576 --> 59:29.565
Twenty-six...

59:33.581 --> 59:35.412
Forget it, he's wasting time.

59:53.434 --> 59:54.423
Thirty-two.

59:59.741 --> 01:00:00.833
Just have 18 more to go...

01:00:02.143 --> 01:00:03.075
What's wrong?

01:00:03.144 --> 01:00:04.941
-I think he's gonna throw up!
-Oh, no.

01:00:05.013 --> 01:00:06.913
-That's it. He's finished.
-C'mon Luke!

01:00:06.948 --> 01:00:08.108
Eighteen to go.

01:00:11.452 --> 01:00:12.111
He's finished.

01:00:21.462 --> 01:00:24.454
Just like a ripe watermelon
that's about to bust itself open.

01:00:24.799 --> 01:00:27.131
Your boy's done for, Drag.
I'm putting in my last tenner.

01:00:27.468 --> 01:00:30.631
-lt don't look good, Drag.
-Man's gut can't hold more than that.

01:00:40.481 --> 01:00:43.473
-He's all right, he's all right.
-He's going to make it.

01:00:54.729 --> 01:00:57.755
I give you a dollar he don't eat
all 50 eggs, I get two dollars back.

01:00:58.166 --> 01:01:00.157
Fixer, you're a sweet old boy.

01:01:00.501 --> 01:01:03.834
Better take that dollar and buy yourself
a new spark plug or something.

01:01:04.172 --> 01:01:06.663
But as long as you done took a stand...

01:01:07.008 --> 01:01:10.000
...why don't you put some money where
your mouth is and not no measly buck!

01:01:10.344 --> 01:01:11.675
Well, all I got is 3.75, Drag.

01:01:12.013 --> 01:01:13.344
That's a bet, Koko.

01:01:13.681 --> 01:01:16.707
All right, now the rest of you, I want
to hear from some big-money men.

01:01:16.784 --> 01:01:18.183
Where's all the high rollers?

01:01:18.519 --> 01:01:22.853
I believe you've got it all, Dragline.
Every cent in the camp is riding.

01:01:36.471 --> 01:01:38.462
-What's the time?
-Come on, baby.

01:01:39.474 --> 01:01:41.305
Twenty-four minutes to go.

01:01:41.709 --> 01:01:45.702
Just let that little old belly sag
and enjoy itself.

01:01:58.726 --> 01:01:59.886
Forty-one.

01:02:00.728 --> 01:02:05.062
Stay loose, buddy. Just nine more
between you and everlasting glory.

01:02:05.399 --> 01:02:08.061
-ls he eating them, Alibi?
-He's chewing. Look at that.

01:02:09.203 --> 01:02:12.070
They're pigeon eggs, that's all.
Fish eggs, practically.

01:02:12.406 --> 01:02:13.566
How much more time, Carr?

01:02:13.908 --> 01:02:15.068
Six minutes to go, Stevie.

01:02:16.644 --> 01:02:18.373
Chew, chew, chew!

01:02:18.446 --> 01:02:19.606
You're helpin' him chew now!

01:02:19.647 --> 01:02:20.306
Oh, no.

01:02:23.251 --> 01:02:24.240
Forty-two.

01:02:26.788 --> 01:02:28.653
Tiny, tiny egg.

01:02:34.762 --> 01:02:36.252
Two minutes to time!

01:02:44.806 --> 01:02:45.795
Forty-four.

01:02:46.107 --> 01:02:49.270
All right, now, get mad
at them damned eggs.

01:02:49.577 --> 01:02:50.566
Eat it there, boy.

01:02:50.778 --> 01:02:51.710
Chew on it.

01:02:51.846 --> 01:02:52.835
Gnaw on it.

01:02:58.886 --> 01:02:59.716
Thirty seconds.

01:03:00.922 --> 01:03:02.514
You got the last one.

01:03:02.723 --> 01:03:04.623
Stuff it down in there. Get it in.

01:03:05.459 --> 01:03:08.451
That's the last one in there now, baby.
Chew. Chew.

01:03:11.332 --> 01:03:13.323
Ten...nine...eight...

01:03:14.335 --> 01:03:17.327
...seven...six...five...

01:03:18.339 --> 01:03:20.534
...four...three...two...

01:03:21.342 --> 01:03:23.537
...one...zero!

01:03:26.814 --> 01:03:28.475
Hold it! He didn't swallow the last.

01:03:29.183 --> 01:03:31.515
You think so? Just take a look here.

01:03:32.286 --> 01:03:33.776
Open that mouth.

01:03:50.004 --> 01:03:51.995
Nobody can eat 50 eggs.

01:04:11.192 --> 01:04:13.057
Snake in the grass here, Boss!

01:04:13.127 --> 01:04:14.560
Get it.

01:04:14.662 --> 01:04:16.254
Get it!

01:04:32.713 --> 01:04:33.577
Hey, Boss.

01:04:34.548 --> 01:04:36.277
Forgot your walking stick?

01:04:48.562 --> 01:04:50.052
Man, you sure can shoot.

01:04:58.406 --> 01:05:01.239
You gone too far when you mess
with the Man With No Eyes.

01:05:01.742 --> 01:05:03.266
You'll be out of here in a little bit.

01:05:03.344 --> 01:05:05.039
Why don't you take it a little easy?

01:05:25.099 --> 01:05:27.590
All right, everybody in the trucks.

01:05:36.110 --> 01:05:38.772
Boy, look at Him go! Bam! Bam!

01:05:39.447 --> 01:05:43.440
Just knock it off, Luke!
You can't talk about Him that way.

01:05:44.118 --> 01:05:46.348
You still believe in that big
bearded Boss up there?

01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:47.444
You think He's watching us?

01:05:47.788 --> 01:05:49.119
Get in here!

01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:50.957
Ain't you scared?

01:05:51.959 --> 01:05:53.620
Ain't you scared of dying?

01:05:53.961 --> 01:05:56.623
Dying? Boy, He can have this
little life anytime He wants to.

01:05:56.964 --> 01:05:58.795
You hear that? You hear it?

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:02.963
Come on! You're welcome to it,
Old Timer.

01:06:03.804 --> 01:06:05.635
Let me know You're up there.
Come on.

01:06:05.973 --> 01:06:08.965
Love me, hate me, kill me, anything.
Just let me know it.

01:06:13.647 --> 01:06:14.978
Just standing in the rain...

01:06:16.317 --> 01:06:17.306
...talking to myself.

01:06:22.656 --> 01:06:25.989
Blind Dick is paying back
three and borrowing five.

01:06:26.527 --> 01:06:27.653
Next.

01:06:27.828 --> 01:06:29.159
You borrowing or paying back?

01:06:29.263 --> 01:06:30.093
Borrowing.

01:06:30.664 --> 01:06:33.997
Well, Mr. Cool Hand here is
the soft heart in our loan department.

01:06:35.136 --> 01:06:36.125
I just need five, Luke.

01:06:39.507 --> 01:06:41.338
I knew you could really
eat all them eggs.

01:06:42.510 --> 01:06:44.000
Yeah, well, I didn't.

01:06:47.181 --> 01:06:49.843
That's my darling Luke.
He grins like a baby...

01:06:50.851 --> 01:06:52.341
...but he bites like a 'gator.

01:06:53.354 --> 01:06:54.844
I believe I still owe you thirty.

01:06:54.922 --> 01:06:56.514
I don't suppose you'd care
to take a check?

01:07:05.733 --> 01:07:06.700
For you.

01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:27.551
His mother's dead.

01:08:20.107 --> 01:08:23.599
"I don't care if it rains or freezes...

01:08:23.944 --> 01:08:27.778
"...as long as I got my plastic Jesus...

01:08:28.115 --> 01:08:32.779
"...sitting on the dashboard of my car.

01:08:36.790 --> 01:08:40.624
"Comes in colors pink and pleasant.

01:08:40.961 --> 01:08:44.624
"Glows in the dark
'cause it's iridescent.

01:08:45.299 --> 01:08:47.790
"Take it with you...

01:08:49.136 --> 01:08:52.127
"...when you travel far.

01:08:55.142 --> 01:08:58.975
"Get yourself a sweet Madonna...

01:08:59.313 --> 01:09:02.975
"...dressed in rhinestone sittin' on...

01:09:03.651 --> 01:09:07.814
"...a pedestal of abalone shell.

01:09:11.158 --> 01:09:14.992
"Going 90, I ain't scary...

01:09:15.662 --> 01:09:19.326
"...'cause I got the Virgin Mary...

01:09:19.667 --> 01:09:21.658
"...assuring me...

01:09:22.336 --> 01:09:25.169
"...that I won't go to hell.

01:09:31.712 --> 01:09:34.545
"Get yourself a sweet Madonna...

01:09:34.715 --> 01:09:37.548
"...dressed in rhinestone sittin' on...

01:09:37.618 --> 01:09:41.554
"...pedestal of abalone shell.

01:09:43.823 --> 01:09:46.657
"Going 90, I ain't scary...

01:09:47.261 --> 01:09:51.390
"...'cause I got the Virgin Mary.
assuring me...

01:09:51.732 --> 01:09:54.565
"...that I won't go to hell."

01:10:14.888 --> 01:10:16.219
Luke, fall out.

01:10:25.733 --> 01:10:28.065
When a man's mother dies and...

01:10:28.569 --> 01:10:32.562
...he gets to thinkin' about her
funeral and paying respects...

01:10:33.407 --> 01:10:36.570
...before he knows it,
his mind ain't right.

01:10:37.578 --> 01:10:40.240
He's got rabbit in his blood
and he runs.

01:10:41.582 --> 01:10:43.573
We're keeping you
off the road for a while.

01:10:51.091 --> 01:10:53.252
I'm going to say a prayer
for your ma, Luke.

01:11:34.301 --> 01:11:38.635
Sorry, Luke, I'm just doing my job.
You've got to appreciate that.

01:11:41.141 --> 01:11:43.302
Calling it your job
don't make it right, Boss.

01:13:05.058 --> 01:13:07.891
Ma's in the ground now,
God rest her soul.

01:13:09.563 --> 01:13:10.894
You best forget about it, Luke.

01:13:12.399 --> 01:13:15.732
Got a day and a half lay-in.
Tomorrow's a holiday.

01:14:08.288 --> 01:14:10.813
-Happy Fourth of July!
-Same to you!

01:14:56.503 --> 01:14:59.666
Break it up. Come on,
you've had your fun.

01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:02.875
First bell! Move it, Stevie.

01:15:08.682 --> 01:15:10.673
What have you got,
another one of them dirty books?

01:15:11.018 --> 01:15:14.681
Do yourself a favor. Read this part
that Koko underlined for me.

01:15:17.691 --> 01:15:21.024
"She moved her head another inch
while he reached up...

01:15:22.029 --> 01:15:24.520
"...and put his left hand on Carol's...

01:15:25.532 --> 01:15:27.022
"...as Carol pressed her..."

01:15:27.868 --> 01:15:29.859
Oh, I can't stand it!

01:15:32.039 --> 01:15:34.371
You're just coming to
the interesting part now.

01:15:47.087 --> 01:15:49.419
-I can't hear you.
-"Her trembling body..."

01:15:57.397 --> 01:16:00.230
Last bell. Last bell.

01:16:02.603 --> 01:16:03.433
Move it.

01:16:04.905 --> 01:16:06.566
What's that noise outside?

01:16:11.078 --> 01:16:12.067
Man on the fence, Boss!

01:16:25.125 --> 01:16:26.114
Wait a minute, damn it!

01:16:27.794 --> 01:16:29.625
Come back here! Dammit!

01:16:34.434 --> 01:16:37.767
Forty-eight, Boss.
One in the box and one in the bush.

01:16:38.438 --> 01:16:41.771
Forty-eight.
One in the box and one in the bush.

01:17:04.798 --> 01:17:06.629
Oh, listen to Blue sing!

01:17:07.801 --> 01:17:11.134
He's on to him, he says. He's got him.

01:17:11.471 --> 01:17:13.302
Hell, that dog's running
around in circles.

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:14.800
No, he's on to him.

01:17:15.308 --> 01:17:17.970
Captain says for us to wait
till the patrol gets here.

01:17:18.812 --> 01:17:20.643
Shoulda waited for me to get him out.

01:17:20.714 --> 01:17:22.477
Loose like that he can run him crazy.

01:17:22.816 --> 01:17:25.649
Didn't even have enough sense to run
from the road like everybody else.

01:17:25.986 --> 01:17:28.318
Oh, I'm beat. This ain't my job nohow.

01:18:28.048 --> 01:18:29.845
Your dogs are crazy.

01:18:31.551 --> 01:18:33.348
He's smarter than a dog. Let's go!

01:21:12.512 --> 01:21:13.706
He made it!

01:21:16.516 --> 01:21:17.710
Look, Captain!

01:21:18.852 --> 01:21:20.342
Look what he done to Blue.

01:21:21.855 --> 01:21:22.844
He's dead.

01:21:26.026 --> 01:21:28.017
He run himself plumb to death.

01:22:02.395 --> 01:22:04.556
Get in line facing the Captain.

01:22:48.308 --> 01:22:51.937
You're going to get used to wearing
them chains after a while, Luke...

01:22:52.312 --> 01:22:54.940
...but you never stop
listening to them clinking.

01:22:56.449 --> 01:22:59.941
'Cause they're going to remind
you of what I've been saying...

01:23:01.121 --> 01:23:02.452
...for your own good.

01:23:03.323 --> 01:23:05.314
Wish you'd stop being
so good to me, Captain.

01:23:09.963 --> 01:23:12.454
Don't you ever talk that way to me.

01:23:13.533 --> 01:23:14.522
Never!

01:23:14.601 --> 01:23:15.659
Never!

01:23:22.976 --> 01:23:25.467
What we've got here is...

01:23:26.479 --> 01:23:28.640
...failure to communicate.

01:23:29.983 --> 01:23:32.975
Some men you just can't reach.

01:23:33.987 --> 01:23:38.651
So you get what we had here last week.
Which is the way he wants it.

01:23:39.359 --> 01:23:40.849
Well, he gets it.

01:23:43.496 --> 01:23:46.988
I don't like it any more than you men.

01:23:56.042 --> 01:23:57.532
Well, lookie here.

01:23:59.379 --> 01:24:00.869
I knew they'd get you.

01:24:01.514 --> 01:24:03.277
Them chains and a bonus
of a couple of years...

01:24:03.349 --> 01:24:06.182
Your running days are over forever, boy.

01:24:06.886 --> 01:24:08.683
Hell, I'd like to see you
try to run again.

01:24:10.023 --> 01:24:13.390
You know, you getting so you smell
so bad I can track you myself.

01:24:15.395 --> 01:24:18.694
Yeah, well, that ought to be easy
for a genuine son of a bitch.

01:24:31.411 --> 01:24:32.844
What happened. How far did you get?

01:24:32.912 --> 01:24:34.038
Shut up and let him eat.

01:24:35.048 --> 01:24:36.413
About a mile and a half.

01:24:39.552 --> 01:24:41.076
This supermarket parking lot.

01:24:41.187 --> 01:24:42.745
Found a car with keys in the ignition.

01:24:43.423 --> 01:24:46.551
Hit this red light and this police car
slides up alongside.

01:24:49.229 --> 01:24:50.560
Then what did you do?

01:24:51.731 --> 01:24:53.062
Waited for that light to change.

01:24:55.435 --> 01:24:57.926
This cop kept looking over, wondering
what somebody looks like me...

01:24:58.238 --> 01:25:01.071
...dressed in state issue, was doin'
driving a shiny new buggy.

01:25:03.843 --> 01:25:05.674
So what did you do?

01:25:06.079 --> 01:25:08.741
He leaned over and said, "Hey!"

01:25:09.749 --> 01:25:12.013
Top flight police work,
that's all there is to it.

01:25:12.152 --> 01:25:13.949
Fella's probably a lieutenant by now.

01:25:21.594 --> 01:25:24.461
Now, we're just gonna lay low
and build time.

01:25:24.597 --> 01:25:26.929
Before you know it,
the heat's going to be off of you.

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:30.467
Everything will be right back
where it was. Right, sweet buddy?

01:25:43.983 --> 01:25:46.281
I hear tell you don't believe
in no God, Luke.

01:25:47.487 --> 01:25:50.217
I was wondering how come a nice,
clean-cut young fellow like you...

01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:52.985
...gets put on the hard road.

01:25:53.993 --> 01:25:55.290
Now I reckon I knows.

01:25:56.996 --> 01:26:00.488
I've been on the road gang
almost 22 years.

01:26:01.801 --> 01:26:04.133
In all that time, I ain't never
killed a white man...

01:26:05.638 --> 01:26:07.299
...but I ain't afraid to because...

01:26:07.807 --> 01:26:10.640
Excuse me, Boss, don't mean
to interrupt. Caught short here.

01:26:11.177 --> 01:26:13.077
So did I. It's okay.

01:26:13.813 --> 01:26:16.145
You just go on out there
behind them trees.

01:26:16.816 --> 01:26:19.011
Man's gotta have his privacy sometime.

01:26:20.019 --> 01:26:22.510
You just keep shaking that bush
so we know you're there.

01:26:23.323 --> 01:26:25.314
Just keep shaking that bush.

01:26:53.553 --> 01:26:54.850
Shaking it up here, Boss!

01:26:59.058 --> 01:27:00.047
Still shaking it, Boss.

01:27:04.364 --> 01:27:06.059
I'm shaking it, Boss.

01:27:30.223 --> 01:27:31.713
He's gone. Get the dogs.

01:28:31.451 --> 01:28:33.112
What you got them on for?

01:28:33.453 --> 01:28:34.613
How do you take your pants off?

01:28:36.689 --> 01:28:40.181
Best way is to get rid
of them leg irons...

01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:41.791
...but you ain't strong enough.

01:28:42.128 --> 01:28:43.459
Strong enough for what?

01:28:45.465 --> 01:28:46.955
Hell, you couldn't heft an axe.

01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:48.130
Can, too.

01:28:48.468 --> 01:28:50.299
-I bet you can't.
-Can, too.

01:28:51.771 --> 01:28:53.204
Bet you can't.

01:28:53.806 --> 01:28:55.467
Well, then, go get it, man.

01:29:02.148 --> 01:29:03.308
What's your name, boy?

01:29:05.818 --> 01:29:07.979
Aren't you going to take
those stripes off your pants?

01:29:09.822 --> 01:29:10.982
You know it, kid.

01:29:26.172 --> 01:29:28.003
-You want to see something real funny?
-Yeah?

01:29:28.174 --> 01:29:30.335
Well, you go on in there
and you get me...

01:29:30.410 --> 01:29:32.674
...chili powder and pepper and the like.

01:29:52.865 --> 01:29:54.526
You better let me handle that, son.

01:30:27.967 --> 01:30:29.298
Here they are.

01:30:30.369 --> 01:30:31.165
Thank you, son.

01:30:31.237 --> 01:30:32.568
What's the matter with him?

01:30:33.239 --> 01:30:34.228
He'll be all right.

01:30:41.414 --> 01:30:44.406
Now listen. You're going to
have some fun. You hear that?

01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:46.809
Well, you remember how them dogs do
when they come through here...

01:30:46.886 --> 01:30:48.751
...so you can tell me about it
someday, okay?

01:32:04.330 --> 01:32:06.321
My wife hasn't written me for a month.

01:32:09.168 --> 01:32:10.499
She's probably sick of you.

01:32:18.010 --> 01:32:19.500
Magazine for you.

01:32:24.016 --> 01:32:26.849
Hey, Koko,
who's sending me magazines?

01:32:29.855 --> 01:32:31.186
Don't know. It's from Atlanta.

01:32:31.524 --> 01:32:32.513
My uncle!

01:32:33.359 --> 01:32:36.351
Ain't heard from him in eight years
and now he's sending me magazines!

01:32:38.197 --> 01:32:39.858
He must have gone crazy!

01:32:44.704 --> 01:32:45.864
Look at that!

01:32:46.205 --> 01:32:48.196
-That's Luke?
-Look at that, two of 'em.

01:32:51.210 --> 01:32:52.700
What's the writing say?

01:32:53.546 --> 01:32:55.036
What's that, that writing say?

01:32:55.548 --> 01:32:57.539
"Dear Boys: Playing it cool."

01:33:05.558 --> 01:33:07.549
They must be six feet tall.

01:33:14.066 --> 01:33:15.397
Look at that!

01:33:15.735 --> 01:33:17.703
My baby! We're in here
digging and dying...

01:33:17.770 --> 01:33:20.238
...he's out there living and flying.

01:33:48.434 --> 01:33:49.924
Koko, will you stop that?

01:33:50.936 --> 01:33:52.597
Why don't you try making me?

01:34:04.283 --> 01:34:07.616
-Hey, Drag? Let me see the picture.
-What for?

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:09.781
Come on, Drag, let us see the picture.

01:34:10.122 --> 01:34:12.181
No, you're just a kid.
What you know about it?

01:34:12.258 --> 01:34:14.055
You don't want to see
that dirty picture.

01:34:14.794 --> 01:34:16.785
Luke and those broads
and all that booze.

01:34:17.396 --> 01:34:18.920
Come on, let me take a look.

01:34:18.964 --> 01:34:21.159
It would go to your coconut head.
You're liable to get ideas...

01:34:21.233 --> 01:34:22.894
...and pass right out.

01:34:23.803 --> 01:34:26.795
Now, what you figure it's worth?
A peek at that there picture?

01:34:27.139 --> 01:34:29.471
A quick look now. I'm not
talking about no memorizing job.

01:34:29.809 --> 01:34:30.969
Cold drink.

01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:33.301
A coke? One cold drink...

01:34:33.646 --> 01:34:36.979
...to feast your starving, fishy,
little eyes on the picture?

01:34:37.316 --> 01:34:39.307
A true vision of paradise itself...

01:34:39.652 --> 01:34:42.314
...with two of the angels right there
frisking around with my boy?

01:34:44.690 --> 01:34:46.021
Okay, it's a deal.

01:34:46.492 --> 01:34:48.323
One cold drink, in advance.

01:35:03.008 --> 01:35:04.908
One chilly bottle right
in my hot little hand.

01:35:04.977 --> 01:35:07.468
That goes for the rest of you
mother-heads, too.

01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:09.338
Let me see.

01:35:09.582 --> 01:35:10.981
Did you pay?

01:35:15.020 --> 01:35:16.180
Come on in there, Wicker Man.

01:35:45.718 --> 01:35:49.711
You run one time,
you got yourself a set o' chains.

01:35:50.289 --> 01:35:52.450
You run twice,
you get yourself two sets.

01:35:53.893 --> 01:35:55.690
You ain't going to need no third set...

01:35:55.761 --> 01:35:57.888
...because you're going to get
your mind right.

01:35:59.231 --> 01:36:01.392
And I mean "right."

01:36:03.068 --> 01:36:05.059
Take a good look at Luke.

01:36:07.406 --> 01:36:08.395
Cool Hand Luke.

01:36:18.350 --> 01:36:20.284
Easy, easy! Let him breathe!

01:36:22.755 --> 01:36:24.916
Oh my poor baby.
They done you real good.

01:36:25.758 --> 01:36:27.589
I don't know if you're going
to have the girls chasing you.

01:36:27.660 --> 01:36:29.184
I'll get some aspirin.

01:36:29.228 --> 01:36:30.354
He should have a doctor.

01:36:30.429 --> 01:36:31.225
Ain't you gonna learn?

01:36:31.297 --> 01:36:33.993
They ain't gonna let no doctor see
what they done.

01:36:34.099 --> 01:36:36.260
Get your razor. We'll clean up
some them cuts on his head.

01:36:38.103 --> 01:36:40.765
How you feeling, buddy?
How you feeling?

01:36:41.941 --> 01:36:44.603
Somebody ought to give him
something cold to drink.

01:36:45.778 --> 01:36:48.269
-That's my baby.
-Now he's going to be all right.

01:36:49.114 --> 01:36:51.947
Hey, Luke, look we got the picture
you sent us. Look here.

01:36:57.456 --> 01:36:59.117
You really can pick 'em, Luke.

01:36:59.458 --> 01:37:01.790
Come on...tell us.
What were they like?

01:37:02.127 --> 01:37:03.788
Can't you wait until he stops bleeding?

01:37:04.196 --> 01:37:06.721
-Why don't ya go back to your knitting?
-Oh, knock it off, you guys.

01:37:06.799 --> 01:37:08.960
Picture's a phoney.
Cost me a week's pay.

01:37:09.301 --> 01:37:10.632
What do you mean, a phoney?

01:37:10.970 --> 01:37:12.164
What you talking about, man?

01:37:12.238 --> 01:37:14.138
We saw them two women
right here in the picture.

01:37:14.807 --> 01:37:16.638
Did you have them both at once?
I mean, together?

01:37:16.976 --> 01:37:20.309
Picture's a phoney.
I had it made up for you guys.

01:37:20.646 --> 01:37:22.136
What do you mean? We saw it all!

01:37:22.781 --> 01:37:23.941
You was having a big time, man.

01:37:24.049 --> 01:37:25.380
You had it made!

01:37:25.651 --> 01:37:27.812
Nothing. Made nothing, had nothing.

01:37:28.487 --> 01:37:30.318
Couple of towns, couple of bosses.

01:37:30.990 --> 01:37:33.151
I laughed out loud once,
he turned me in.

01:37:33.492 --> 01:37:34.481
But I got it here!

01:37:34.827 --> 01:37:38.160
Oh, come on! Stop beating it!

01:37:39.498 --> 01:37:40.988
Get out there yourself!

01:37:42.501 --> 01:37:46.335
Stop feeding off me! Get outa here!

01:37:46.472 --> 01:37:48.235
Can't breathe. Give me some air!

01:37:55.347 --> 01:37:57.281
Well, he ain't himself,
can't you see that?

01:37:57.383 --> 01:37:59.681
He's all beat up. He don't know
what he's sayin'.

01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:03.750
All right, come on, break it up.

01:38:03.889 --> 01:38:05.447
Now, straighten out that bench.

01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:29.347
You were eyeballing.

01:38:29.415 --> 01:38:32.043
Can't get your mind on them weeds
if you're eyeballing.

01:38:32.718 --> 01:38:35.380
You don't need reasons to kick me, Boss.

01:38:41.260 --> 01:38:42.921
First bell. Move it.

01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:49.731
He'll never make it.

01:38:50.069 --> 01:38:51.229
What are you talking about?

01:39:03.048 --> 01:39:06.540
That old box will collapse and fall
apart before old Luke calls it quits.

01:39:06.885 --> 01:39:09.046
Your Luke's got more guts than brains.

01:39:09.388 --> 01:39:11.049
Well, I don't see
no sign of guts in you.

01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:14.052
No. No chains, either.

01:39:14.393 --> 01:39:16.554
Big deal paperhanger,
passing two bit checks.

01:39:16.895 --> 01:39:19.728
You haven't had much luck playing
follow-the-leader, have you?

01:39:26.071 --> 01:39:28.062
You want to spend the night
in the box, too?

01:39:32.911 --> 01:39:36.904
Well, here's our champion hog-gut.
Hasn't eaten for four days.

01:39:37.249 --> 01:39:40.241
You're going to need a little extra.
Got plenty for you.

01:39:40.586 --> 01:39:41.712
Now you know the rules.

01:39:41.854 --> 01:39:44.084
Got to clean your plate or go back
to the box. Right, Boss?

01:39:44.423 --> 01:39:45.412
That's enough, Dogboy.

01:39:45.758 --> 01:39:47.749
Oh, man used to free-world food
has got a big appetite.

01:39:47.893 --> 01:39:50.259
We're going to stretch that
hog-belly right out?

01:41:16.448 --> 01:41:18.439
Well, you made the week, boy.

01:41:19.184 --> 01:41:22.176
Now you got a day and a half
to rest up for old Monday.

01:41:52.217 --> 01:41:54.708
That ditch is Boss Kean's ditch.

01:41:55.387 --> 01:41:57.548
I told him that dirt in it is your dirt.

01:41:58.557 --> 01:42:00.548
What's your dirt doing in his ditch?

01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:03.220
I don't know, Boss.

01:42:04.396 --> 01:42:06.227
You better get in there
and get it out, boy.

01:42:22.414 --> 01:42:25.906
"We work in the morning
hear the ding-dong ring...

01:42:26.752 --> 01:42:30.244
"...go march to the table,
see the same damn thing.

01:42:30.923 --> 01:42:34.586
"Well, it's on the table,
a knife, a fork and a pan.

01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:38.593
"Say anything about it you
get in trouble with the man.

01:42:41.266 --> 01:42:44.929
"That Midnight Special.
Shine a light on me.

01:42:45.604 --> 01:42:49.438
"Let the Midnight Special shine
your ever-loving light on me.

01:42:51.610 --> 01:42:54.943
"If you ever go to Houston,
boy, you better walk right.

01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:59.273
"And you better not stagger,
and you better not fight...

01:42:59.952 --> 01:43:02.113
"...Because the sheriff
will arrest you."

01:43:02.454 --> 01:43:04.115
Luke, what you think you're doing?

01:43:07.125 --> 01:43:09.958
Just getting my dirt out of
Boss Kean's ditch, Boss.

01:43:10.295 --> 01:43:13.128
I'm damned if you're going
to put your dirt in my yard.

01:43:13.465 --> 01:43:15.330
You hear me?

01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:16.697
Now let's get it out of here.

01:44:00.345 --> 01:44:03.678
I told you to get your dirt out
of Boss Kean's ditch, didn't I?

01:44:07.452 --> 01:44:08.612
Yeah, Boss.

01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:10.820
Then how come it ain't out?

01:44:17.362 --> 01:44:19.193
I don't know, Boss.

01:44:19.531 --> 01:44:21.192
You don't know.

01:44:44.723 --> 01:44:48.716
"Ain't no grave going
to keep my body down.

01:44:50.729 --> 01:44:53.061
"Ain't no grave...

01:44:53.398 --> 01:44:56.390
"...going to hold my body down.

01:44:58.737 --> 01:45:02.229
"Keep Your mind on me above.

01:45:03.075 --> 01:45:06.567
"Keep Your heart full of love.

01:45:07.079 --> 01:45:10.571
"Ain't no grave
gonna hold my body down..."

01:45:51.790 --> 01:45:53.781
What's all this dirt doing in here?

01:46:01.032 --> 01:46:03.023
I don't know...

01:46:13.979 --> 01:46:18.643
"When I was a little bitty baby, my
mamma used to rock me in my cradle.

01:46:18.984 --> 01:46:22.476
"In them old cotton fields back home."

01:46:25.657 --> 01:46:26.988
Don't, Boss.

01:46:27.292 --> 01:46:28.657
Get to work.

01:46:29.494 --> 01:46:31.325
Don't, Boss. Don't hit me anymore.

01:46:34.666 --> 01:46:36.497
For God's sake, don't hit me anymore.

01:46:37.335 --> 01:46:41.169
What was that you said?
What was that name you used, Luke?

01:46:43.008 --> 01:46:43.997
Oh, God!

01:46:46.511 --> 01:46:47.500
Oh, God!

01:46:53.018 --> 01:46:55.680
Oh, God, I pray to God
you don't hit me anymore.

01:46:58.857 --> 01:47:01.849
I'll do anything you say,
but I can't take anymore.

01:47:03.028 --> 01:47:06.691
-You got your mind right, Luke?
-Yeah...

01:47:08.033 --> 01:47:09.193
...mind right.

01:47:13.038 --> 01:47:15.029
Oh, I got it right, Boss.

01:47:22.881 --> 01:47:24.542
Suppose you was to backslide on us?

01:47:24.883 --> 01:47:26.874
Oh, no, I won't, Boss.

01:47:27.719 --> 01:47:29.880
Suppose you was to back-sass?

01:47:30.388 --> 01:47:32.720
Oh, no, I won't. I won't.
I got my mind right.

01:47:41.233 --> 01:47:43.224
You try to run again,
we're going to kill you.

01:47:43.735 --> 01:47:45.225
I won't, I won't, Boss.

01:47:51.910 --> 01:47:56.244
Go get cleaned up and get yourself
some sleep. Expect you need it.

01:47:58.750 --> 01:48:00.081
Come on, son.

01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:03.410
Come on up outa there.

01:49:07.018 --> 01:49:08.349
I got my mind right.

01:49:44.723 --> 01:49:45.883
Where are you?

01:49:47.726 --> 01:49:49.216
Where are you now?

01:50:36.408 --> 01:50:39.900
-All right. Smoke it up.
-Yes, sir.

01:50:42.113 --> 01:50:44.104
Luke, water 'em down.

01:50:45.817 --> 01:50:46.909
Yes, Boss.

01:51:08.973 --> 01:51:10.964
Luke! Fetch the rifle.

01:52:01.526 --> 01:52:02.686
You got him, Boss. You got him.

01:52:03.862 --> 01:52:05.193
Go fetch it, Luke.

01:52:25.884 --> 01:52:28.717
There he is, Boss.
Deader than hell, but won't let go.

01:52:39.230 --> 01:52:41.061
You cut that up for our lunch, Luke.

01:52:43.001 --> 01:52:44.832
Yes, Boss Paul.

01:53:31.115 --> 01:53:33.606
He took the keys off of Dogboy's truck.

01:53:34.619 --> 01:53:36.450
He got the keys here, too.

01:53:52.804 --> 01:53:55.967
"I'm shaking it here, Boss.
I'm shaking it."

01:54:02.146 --> 01:54:03.807
That's my baby, Luke.

01:54:07.318 --> 01:54:10.481
"Don't hit me, Boss.
Only don't hit me.

01:54:11.489 --> 01:54:13.150
"I'll do whatever you say."

01:54:15.493 --> 01:54:18.053
You are an original,
that's what you are.

01:54:18.129 --> 01:54:20.825
Those mullet-heads didn't
even know you were fooling.

01:54:22.667 --> 01:54:26.262
Fooling them? You can't fool them
about something like that.

01:54:26.337 --> 01:54:27.395
They broke me.

01:54:28.840 --> 01:54:31.502
But they didn't get my mind right.
Not with no sticks. No, sir.

01:54:33.177 --> 01:54:35.509
All that time you were planning
on running again.

01:54:36.848 --> 01:54:38.839
Never planned anything in my life.

01:55:05.209 --> 01:55:08.042
That's just a little old farm road.
Clean as a whistle.

01:55:08.379 --> 01:55:11.712
I worked it a couple times.
We're home free. Come on.

01:55:12.050 --> 01:55:13.210
We ain't going nowhere.

01:55:13.318 --> 01:55:15.013
Now, what are you talking about, Luke?

01:55:15.553 --> 01:55:18.215
We're going by my house and
we're going to have a big meal.

01:55:18.556 --> 01:55:22.890
Then I'm going to show you a couple of
farm girls that really know what fun...

01:55:24.228 --> 01:55:25.889
And then we're going
to get Koko out of there.

01:55:26.230 --> 01:55:28.892
And then the terrible trio
is gonna be complete again.

01:55:28.967 --> 01:55:32.266
Man, this old free world ain't going
to know which ear to stand on.

01:55:33.404 --> 01:55:36.396
Yeah, well, you and Koko
can handle it without me.

01:55:37.709 --> 01:55:39.700
What's you mean, Luke?

01:55:40.078 --> 01:55:41.909
I done enough world-shaking
for a while.

01:55:42.246 --> 01:55:45.238
You do the rest of it for me.
Send me a postcard about it.

01:55:45.483 --> 01:55:47.041
-But Luke...
-Take it easy, Drag.

01:55:47.585 --> 01:55:48.574
Where are you going?

01:55:49.587 --> 01:55:50.815
Just on my own.

01:55:52.256 --> 01:55:54.918
But what am I going to do
all by myself?

01:55:57.428 --> 01:56:00.761
Man, if I hadn't lost my head.
I only had a couple of years to do.

01:56:02.100 --> 01:56:05.263
But when I saw you tearing down
the road in that truck...

01:56:08.606 --> 01:56:10.267
Well, you're right, Luke.

01:56:11.609 --> 01:56:13.270
We ought to split up.

01:56:13.945 --> 01:56:17.745
And then, and then it will be
safer for the both of us.

01:56:22.954 --> 01:56:25.946
Just the same,
you're a good old boy, Luke.

01:56:29.293 --> 01:56:30.624
You take care!

01:57:27.885 --> 01:57:29.216
Anybody here?

01:57:44.902 --> 01:57:46.733
Hey, Old Man. You home tonight?

01:57:52.243 --> 01:57:55.235
Can You spare a minute.
It's about time we had a little talk.

01:57:59.750 --> 01:58:01.581
I know I'm a pretty evil fellow...

01:58:02.420 --> 01:58:05.753
...killed people in the war
and got drunk...

01:58:06.591 --> 01:58:08.684
...and chewed up
municipal property and the like.

01:58:08.826 --> 01:58:10.794
I know I got no call to ask for much...

01:58:10.928 --> 01:58:14.091
...but even so, You've got to admit You
ain't dealt me no cards in a long time.

01:58:16.934 --> 01:58:20.267
It's beginning to look like You got
things fixed so I can't never win out.

01:58:22.106 --> 01:58:23.266
Inside, outside, all of them...

01:58:24.842 --> 01:58:28.334
...rules and regulations and bosses.

01:58:28.412 --> 01:58:30.243
You made me like I am.

01:58:30.581 --> 01:58:32.776
Now just where am I supposed to fit in?

01:58:35.786 --> 01:58:38.619
Old Man, I gotta tell You.

01:58:40.458 --> 01:58:42.790
I started out pretty strong and fast.

01:58:47.465 --> 01:58:49.126
But it's beginning to get to me.

01:58:52.136 --> 01:58:53.296
When does it end?

01:58:55.139 --> 01:58:56.800
What do You got in mind for me?

01:58:57.975 --> 01:58:59.465
What do I do now?

01:59:14.659 --> 01:59:16.149
On my knees, asking.

01:59:28.839 --> 01:59:30.500
Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:59:33.010 --> 01:59:35.001
I guess I'm pretty tough
to deal with?

01:59:36.514 --> 01:59:38.004
A hard case.

01:59:41.352 --> 01:59:43.320
Guess I gotta find my own way.

02:00:08.179 --> 02:00:09.840
Is that Your answer, Old Man?

02:00:12.383 --> 02:00:14.374
I guess You're a hard case, too.

02:00:19.890 --> 02:00:21.881
Luke, you all right?

02:00:24.061 --> 02:00:27.895
They got us, boy. They're out there,
thicker than flies.

02:00:28.566 --> 02:00:30.557
Bosses, dogs, sheriffs...

02:00:30.901 --> 02:00:33.893
...more guns than I've ever seen
in my life. You ain't got a chance.

02:00:34.238 --> 02:00:36.900
They caught up with me
right after we split up.

02:00:37.408 --> 02:00:40.900
And they were aiming to kill you.
But I fixed that.

02:00:41.579 --> 02:00:44.571
I got them to promise
if you give up peaceful...

02:00:45.416 --> 02:00:47.577
...they ain't even going
to whip you this time.

02:00:49.420 --> 02:00:51.911
They even going to give us
our same bunks back?

02:00:52.256 --> 02:00:54.087
Sure, why not?

02:00:54.425 --> 02:00:58.589
We only been gone a couple of hours.
They're reasonable men.

02:01:07.938 --> 02:01:09.599
You've got to listen to me.

02:01:10.941 --> 02:01:14.274
All you've got to do is give up...

02:01:14.945 --> 02:01:16.276
...nice and quiet.

02:01:17.615 --> 02:01:19.446
Just play it cool.

02:01:22.453 --> 02:01:23.977
Yeah, like I always do?

02:01:24.555 --> 02:01:26.318
Yeah, just play it...

02:01:54.819 --> 02:01:58.653
"What we got here
is a failure to communicate."

02:02:42.366 --> 02:02:43.355
Go get him.

02:03:20.571 --> 02:03:23.768
You hang on in there, Luke.
You hang on.

02:03:25.910 --> 02:03:28.743
There's going to be some
world-shaking, Luke.

02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:32.071
We're going to send you a postcard.

02:03:33.751 --> 02:03:36.242
You follow me and I'll radio
the emergency clinic to open up.

02:03:36.587 --> 02:03:38.578
I'm taking him to the prison hospital.

02:03:38.789 --> 02:03:40.654
But that's an hour away.
He isn't going to make it.

02:03:40.758 --> 02:03:42.589
Get out of the way. He's ours.

02:04:28.272 --> 02:04:30.365
They took him right down that road.

02:04:30.641 --> 02:04:33.132
-What'd he look like, Drag?
-Yeah, Drag.

02:04:33.644 --> 02:04:35.373
Did he have his eyes open or closed?

02:04:35.479 --> 02:04:38.004
-He was smiling.
-Smiling?!

02:04:39.884 --> 02:04:41.181
That's right. You know...

02:04:42.853 --> 02:04:44.514
...that...Luke smile of his?

02:04:45.322 --> 02:04:47.483
He had it on his face
right to the very end.

02:04:47.992 --> 02:04:48.959
Hell, if they didn't know it 'fore...

02:04:49.026 --> 02:04:51.824
...they could tell right then that they
weren't ever going to beat him.

02:04:53.831 --> 02:04:55.321
That old Luke smile.

02:04:57.701 --> 02:05:01.364
Oh, Luke. He was some boy.

02:05:01.539 --> 02:05:03.598
Cool Hand Luke, hell!

02:05:03.774 --> 02:05:05.935
He's a natural born world-shaker!
