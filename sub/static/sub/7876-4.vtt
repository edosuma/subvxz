Bye, Mom. Going on the road with Klaus

00:48.882 --> 00:50.509
- It's a band. Peace.
- Hang on, missy.

00:50.617 --> 00:51.777

- Check.

- Emergency credit card?
- Check.

- Morning-after pills?
- Twenty and a refill.

00:55.622 --> 00:58.989
All right.
Have fun, you two.

Stanford Smith, I forbid you to fly.

01:14.307 --> 01:16.298
Small planes are very dangerous.

01:16.409 --> 01:18.639
That's ridiculous. Small
planes are the safest of all.

01:18.745 --> 01:21.043
If Ritchie Valens's plane had
been just a little bit smaller...

01:21.147 --> 01:23.047
- he'd still be alive today.
- Please.

01:23.149 --> 01:25.379
I am begging you.
Don't fly.

01:25.485 --> 01:28.750
Stan, I didn't want to
tell you this, but...

01:28.855 --> 01:32.518
20 years ago,
right before I met you...

01:32.625 --> 01:35.321
- I was engaged to another man.
- What?

01:35.428 --> 01:39.023
- His name was Travis. He was a pilot.
- Like me.

01:39.132 --> 01:41.657
Well, one day,
his small plane went down.

01:41.768 --> 01:45.465
No!

01:45.572 --> 01:49.008
That's just a reenactment
of what I did when I found out.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.509
Anyway, I thought he was dead.

01:51.611 --> 01:55.172
He turned up alive a couple
of months after I met you.

01:55.281 --> 01:57.306
But by that time, we were engaged...

01:57.417 --> 01:59.317
and I knew you were the one for me.

01:59.419 --> 02:02.286
Your heart was promised to another?

02:02.388 --> 02:04.447
Why-Why didn't you ever tell me?

02:04.557 --> 02:06.957
Because I thought you'd overreact.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.789
But actually, you're taking
this better than I expected.

02:09.895 --> 02:11.796
[Sighs]
I'm so relieved.

02:11.898 --> 02:14.992
- [Whimpering Softly]
- What do you feel like for dinner?

02:15.101 --> 02:17.797
[Voice Breaking] I don't know.
Like a niçoise salad. Something easy.

- Roger, what the hell?

02:33.153 --> 02:35.917
- Where'd all these people come from?
- Club Rubber just let out.

Everybody's still rolling pretty hard,
and I'm selling water.

02:38.725 --> 02:41.819
- Want to hand out pacifiers?
- Oh, I'm not in the mood.

02:41.928 --> 02:44.954
- I found out that Francine-
- Oh, the whole missing fiancé thing.

02:45.064 --> 02:47.999
- She told you?
- No, I was under the table when she told you.

02:48.101 --> 02:50.001
Don't ask what I was
doing under there.

02:50.103 --> 02:52.003
- [Whispers] Ask.
- What were you doing under the-

02:52.105 --> 02:55.700
Eavesdropping. Anyway, you're probably
feeling like second best, huh?

02:55.808 --> 03:00.677
Like you wouldn't believe. There's some guy
out there who Francine almost married.

03:00.780 --> 03:02.680
Who is he?
What's he all about?

03:02.782 --> 03:06.115
- Is he better than me?
- It's normal. You're curious, like the monkey...

03:06.219 --> 03:08.653
except he was curious about whether
the man in the yellow hat...

03:08.755 --> 03:12.191
would violate him with a banana,
which is something to be curious about.

03:12.292 --> 03:15.227
I just wish I knew what
Francine's ex was like.

Pound it.

Can I rub your back?

03:25.071 --> 03:27.665
Boy, does that sound like heaven.
Kind of in a rush though.

- Stan, why the hell did you
track down my ex-fiancé?

07:01.020 --> 07:03.284
Because I had to see
how I stacked up.

Stan, you're my true love.
I chose you.

07:13.533 --> 07:17.629
You chose nothing. Travis's faulty
plane engine did all the choosing for you.

11:18.411 --> 11:21.642
I got my answer.
Francine chose me. Me!

11:21.747 --> 11:23.681
- Ow!
- Dumbo.

11:23.783 --> 11:27.241
Just because Francine didn't hook up with
Travis tonight doesn't mean anything.

11:27.353 --> 11:31.449
You're the father of her kids.
Let's use this hot dog as a metaphor.

11:31.557 --> 11:33.855
- I'm not sure what a metaphor is.
- Hey!

11:33.959 --> 11:36.894
Look. If you really want to know
who Francine would choose...

11:36.996 --> 11:39.021
you have to disappear for a while.

11:39.131 --> 11:40.758
Like Travis did.

11:40.866 --> 11:43.858
Exactly. If she waits for you,
she loves you.

11:43.969 --> 11:45.869
If she goes for Travis, she doesn't.

11:45.971 --> 11:48.940
- Either way, you get your answer.
- Yes.

11:49.041 --> 11:52.238
Yes. Don't worry.
I've got this all under control.

11:52.344 --> 11:54.369
Mayday! Mayday!
We're going down!

<i>I think we really sold that crash landing.</i>

12:03.355 --> 12:08.054
<i>[Roger] Oh, were you doing crash landing?</i>
<i>I was doing "found out my son is gay. '"</i>

12:08.160 --> 12:10.128
<i>[Seagulls Squawking]</i>

12:13.065 --> 12:15.397
This island is a secret
C.I.A. Hideout.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.372
<i>I've hidden cameras</i>
<i>everywhere in our house...</i>

12:20.473 --> 12:22.941
<i>so we can watch Francine get the news</i>
<i>that I've gone missing.</i>

12:23.042 --> 12:26.068
- Then Travis will show up to comfort her.
- How do you know?

12:26.178 --> 12:28.169
I invited him over
for Sunday brunch.

12:28.280 --> 12:31.113
Oh. I thought you were gonna
say something funny.

12:31.217 --> 12:35.278
No. Not everything is funny, Roger.
Sometimes you just have to get information out.

12:35.387 --> 12:38.015
Francine got over Travis
after about two months, so...

12:38.124 --> 12:40.058
that's how long we'll stay here.

12:40.159 --> 12:42.059
Hopefully she'll wait for me.

12:42.161 --> 12:45.130
But if not, well,
I'll have my answer.

12:45.231 --> 12:47.199
[Ice Cubes Rattling]

12:47.299 --> 12:50.234
Oh, I stopped listening. If you're not
gonna make the effort to be entertaining...

12:50.336 --> 12:52.236
I'm not gonna go
the extra mile to listen.

12:52.338 --> 12:54.738
[Chuckles]
The- <i>" The extra mile."</i>

12:54.840 --> 12:57.570

to just listen to somebody.

13:00.246 --> 13:02.612
It's happening!
Roger, get over here.

13:02.715 --> 13:05.183
She's getting the news
that our plane is lost at sea.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.185

- <i>[Laughs]</i>

13:08.287 --> 13:12.747

Roger, you're missing all the fun.

13:12.858 --> 13:15.793
- <i>[Rumbling]</i>
- Stan, am I drunk?

13:15.895 --> 13:17.795
I mean- I mean,
I'm definitely drunk, but...

13:17.897 --> 13:19.797
is that regular size?

13:19.899 --> 13:21.958
Oh, my God!

13:31.177 --> 13:33.611

- L- l-I think so.

13:33.712 --> 13:37.045
Wait. Wait. Where are my sunglasses?
Look for them, damn you. Look for them!

13:37.149 --> 13:39.743
Oh, thank God.

L- l- I can't-

13:53.332 --> 13:56.859
It's not good luck anymore! Help!

13:56.969 --> 13:58.903
- Help!
- Get a hold of yourself.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.063
I'll figure out a way
off this island.

14:01.173 --> 14:04.472
Hey. There is good news.
I overcame my fear of seagulls.

- [Sobbing]
- <i>[Doorbell Rings]</i>

14:12.218 --> 14:15.085
I got you some supplies.
How you holding up?

14:15.187 --> 14:19.214
The Coast Guard called.
They've given up the search.

14:19.325 --> 14:21.759
- [Sobs]
- Shh.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.352
Now, now.
Travis is here.

<i>[Seagulls Squawking]</i>

14:26.599 --> 14:29.693
- [Squawks]
- Roger, I think I figured out
a way to get off the island.

14:29.802 --> 14:32.327
- Is there such a thing as a time crab?
- Shh!

14:32.438 --> 14:35.839
You're scaring the gulls.
I gotta lasso enough to fly me home.

14:35.941 --> 14:40.071
I had the greatest woman in the world,
and I've let my insecurity ruin everything.

14:40.179 --> 14:41.771
[Squawking]

14:41.881 --> 14:45.214
Ha! Thirteen!
That should do it.

14:45.317 --> 14:48.013
All right, seagulls.
Take me home. Hyah!

Stan, dinner.

<i>[Roger Groans] Stan, these gulls</i>
<i>are running right through me, you bastard.</i>

15:04.303 --> 15:06.498

15:06.605 --> 15:09.233
I'll be back to Francine in no time.

15:10.843 --> 15:14.643
Toss me a leaf, you son of a bitch.
I'm passing a beak over here.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.443
I will get off this island.
And you know why?

15:17.549 --> 15:22.077
Because Francine loves me, and I know
she'll wait for me, no matter how long it takes.

15:22.187 --> 15:25.054
- [Laughing]
- [Laughing] I've waited long enough.

15:25.157 --> 15:27.318
Stan would want me to move on.

15:28.994 --> 15:31.724
These rocks will make a fine raft.

15:31.830 --> 15:35.926
Oh. Hello. Tying together rocks.
Smart. Outside the box.

15:36.035 --> 15:38.868
Anyway, just wanted to apologize
for all my whining.

15:38.971 --> 15:40.905
I realize now that it's been
counterproductive.

15:41.006 --> 15:42.906
Oh. Thanks, Roger.

15:43.008 --> 15:44.942
As you can see,
I've fashioned a disguise...

15:45.044 --> 15:47.239
out of seagull feathers
for when we're rescued.

15:47.346 --> 15:50.042
I'm feeling optimistic.
So Ira and l-This is Ira.

15:50.149 --> 15:53.209

driftwood for a signal fire.

rent myself out to Cubans.

Stan, wait. I was just pretending to have

Uh, yeah. Maybe I could have

I figured you had
some stupid plan to test me.

20:19.384 --> 20:22.820
So I pretended I was moving on
with Travis for the cameras...

20:22.921 --> 20:25.151
to make you jealous
and lure you home.

20:25.257 --> 20:28.988

- Francine, a tsunami wiped out our equipment.

20:29.094 --> 20:31.358
