00:16.267 --> 00:18.767
NARRATOR: On this episode
of Life Below Zero,

00:18.800 --> 00:22.933
when opportunity knocks
Alaskans seize the day.

00:22.967 --> 00:24.767
IDI: Hurry up,
they're going up the hill.

00:24.800 --> 00:28.400
NARRATOR: An uninvited
intruder interrupts
Andy's summer project.

00:28.433 --> 00:30.033
(GASPS) We got a bear.

00:30.067 --> 00:33.767
NARRATOR: The Hailstones
play the long game
in order to secure food.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.900
IDI: It's still running, Ting.
Hurry up!

00:35.933 --> 00:38.667
NARRATOR: Sue's plan
to harvest her own garden
hits a snag.

00:38.700 --> 00:40.933
What I say goes
whether it makes sense or not.

00:40.967 --> 00:44.300
NARRATOR: And Glenn uses
a new tool in his quest
for sustenance.

00:44.333 --> 00:47.333
GLENN: It's a difficult time
of the year for me
to get food.

01:07.800 --> 01:10.733
CHIP: Plan is for me
to go get firewood while
my daughters do some hunting.

01:10.767 --> 01:12.300
Ting and Idi are experienced,

01:12.333 --> 01:14.433
and the younger ones
need to see it,
and they need to interact.

01:14.467 --> 01:16.267
It's also not
a man's only deal.

01:16.300 --> 01:17.633
Women like to hunt, too.

01:20.333 --> 01:22.133
NARRATOR: For Chip
and Agnes Hailstone,

01:22.167 --> 01:24.433
surviving off the land
is a native tradition

01:24.467 --> 01:27.433
they hope to pass on
to their children.

01:27.467 --> 01:30.667
But mastering these skills
takes years of discipline.

01:30.700 --> 01:32.933
CHIP: I think these girls
are gonna grow up
to be as good a hunters

01:32.967 --> 01:34.000
as maybe their brothers.

01:35.633 --> 01:37.567
Tinmiaq, that kid makes me
so happy.

01:37.600 --> 01:39.367
She learned from her brothers.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.333
Ting, you can't be scared
to throw a harpoon.

01:41.367 --> 01:43.133
You have to have
your mind set.

01:43.167 --> 01:44.900
CHIP: And her sisters are
following right behind her.

01:50.400 --> 01:54.267
NARRATOR: With Chip upriver
and Agnes cooking
on the outskirts of camp,

01:54.300 --> 01:56.733
21-year-old Tinmiaq
is in charge,

01:56.767 --> 02:00.500
and she's prepared for
any prey that may venture by.

02:01.733 --> 02:03.867
For my birthday this year
I bought this.

02:03.900 --> 02:07.033
This is a high-powered rifle,
a .223.

02:08.133 --> 02:10.233
It's a gun that
I'm getting to know.

02:10.267 --> 02:13.433
And it's got a scope,
and I'm not used
to the scopes,

02:13.467 --> 02:15.967
so I've been trying
to practise with it.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.667
Shoot it off, use the scope,

02:17.700 --> 02:20.400
but it's got
a 30 round clip on it,

02:20.433 --> 02:22.533
so I can just go
bap, bap, bap, bap, bap.

02:22.567 --> 02:24.500
So I could get
the bigger game animals

02:24.533 --> 02:26.633
like the caribous,
and the musk ox,

02:26.667 --> 02:29.000
and scare off some bears
or something.

02:29.767 --> 02:31.267
(IDI SPEAKING)

02:32.800 --> 02:34.467
(TING SPEAKING)

02:35.967 --> 02:37.267
IDI: Hurry up.
They're going up the hill.

02:38.300 --> 02:39.733
-(CONTINUES SPEAKING)
-TING: Shh!

02:39.767 --> 02:41.333
Just stand still.
Stand still.

02:44.633 --> 02:45.700
I shot the caribou.

02:50.900 --> 02:52.767
IDI: It's still running, Ting!
Hurry up!

02:52.800 --> 02:54.333
And the water's soaking.

02:55.233 --> 02:56.667
(TING SPEAKING)

03:03.900 --> 03:05.433
(IDI SPEAKING)

03:09.367 --> 03:10.767
TING: Where is it?
You girls could see it?

03:10.800 --> 03:11.867
Right there.

03:14.800 --> 03:17.233
IDI: Qutan, get back! Qutan!

03:18.033 --> 03:19.233
Carol!

03:26.000 --> 03:27.067
You missed!

03:27.700 --> 03:29.533
It's taking off again.

03:29.567 --> 03:31.900
Might as well give me
your rifle.

03:31.933 --> 03:34.500
TING: (SIGHS)
Yup, it's getting away,

03:34.533 --> 03:35.967
but I'll go get it.

03:40.300 --> 03:42.033
SUE: Do I know
what I'm doing?

03:42.067 --> 03:44.600
I only know what I wanna do.
That's the beauty of being me.

03:44.633 --> 03:48.367
There's nobody here
but myself so not many people
in line telling me "no."

03:56.000 --> 03:58.633
From the end of September
to the following June,
I don't get deliveries,

03:58.667 --> 04:00.300
I don't get fresh vegetables.

04:00.333 --> 04:03.800
If I can grow things,
dehydrate, or freeze them,

04:03.833 --> 04:05.967
I'm ahead of the game
on my own nutrition
and health.

04:07.967 --> 04:10.367
I wanna do a greenhouse
this year.

04:10.400 --> 04:14.267
So getting this done
is really important to me.

04:14.300 --> 04:17.033
I am getting older.
I do have some injuries.

04:17.067 --> 04:19.133
Last year, Rick,
a family member, came up

04:19.167 --> 04:21.767
and helped me out
for a couple months,

04:21.800 --> 04:24.267
and so I brought him
back up this year.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.800
Right now when I want
blueberries or cranberries,

04:28.833 --> 04:31.867
I gotta go into the fields
and duke it out
with the bears.

04:31.900 --> 04:36.100
I wanna see,
can I hydroponically take
some of those wild plants,

04:36.133 --> 04:38.067
put them in my tiny garden,

04:38.100 --> 04:39.667
and grow my own blueberries,

04:39.700 --> 04:42.700
and cranberries,
and crowberries,
and bearberries,

04:42.733 --> 04:45.133
and then I don't have to mess
with the bears.

04:45.167 --> 04:47.500
They can have their tundra,
and I've got my little space.

04:49.567 --> 04:52.567
NARRATOR:
Because of the extreme
conditions of the tundra,

04:52.600 --> 04:55.267
Sue must improvise a way
to plant her food.

04:55.300 --> 04:56.500
SUE: I don't have dirt here.

04:56.533 --> 04:58.333
I always have to import
the dirt.

04:58.367 --> 05:03.567
The most expensive cost
is the $5,000 per trip plane
bringing it up here.

05:03.600 --> 05:06.733
I wanna get, um...
The sphagnum moss
that grows up here

05:06.767 --> 05:08.267
is an extremely good medium.

05:08.300 --> 05:11.433
If I mix that with round rock
from the river...

05:11.467 --> 05:14.633
Water comes down,
nutrients are flowing around,

05:14.667 --> 05:16.433
the plants soak up
what they can.

05:16.467 --> 05:19.933
You know, for thousands
of years tundra hydroponics
has worked.

05:19.967 --> 05:23.200
It's time for me to start
emulating what's already here.

05:23.233 --> 05:24.533
This is what I'm trying to do.

05:24.567 --> 05:28.433
This is a plant,
which is not this plant,

05:28.467 --> 05:32.633
yet it's using this plant
to hold the nutrients
and moisture to grow.

05:32.667 --> 05:35.133
That's what I want.

05:35.167 --> 05:38.933
My curiosity is just like
this curious little monkey,
and it's going everywhere.

05:38.967 --> 05:42.967
And so I've gotta give it
little tricks here and there
so it can be satisfied.

05:49.833 --> 05:51.100
There.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.567
Now I have clean,
sterile rocks.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.400
They're a little hot.
(LAUGHS)

06:01.100 --> 06:03.000
So, take a little basket.

06:03.033 --> 06:05.133
You can see, there's holes.

06:05.167 --> 06:07.900
I wanna put some of this moss.

06:07.933 --> 06:11.133
The moss will retain
the nutrients

06:11.167 --> 06:15.733
that I've put through
in the water as well as
some rocks.

06:15.767 --> 06:18.200
Roots have to have
a little bit of oxygen.

06:18.233 --> 06:19.833
You can't just, you know...

06:19.867 --> 06:23.167
If you put them
just in the solid
hard-packed environment,

06:23.200 --> 06:25.633
it's just too hard
on the little guys.
They can't grow too well.

06:25.667 --> 06:29.267
So this is called your medium
for growing your plants.

06:29.300 --> 06:32.667
I'm really excited to have
thought of something

06:32.700 --> 06:37.233
that is emulating what nature
has already proven
works up here.

06:37.267 --> 06:40.433
And now it's time to see
if I can make it work.

06:43.633 --> 06:45.567
ANDY: I wouldn't call
myself a perfectionist,

06:45.600 --> 06:49.833
but I try and do the best job
I can at everything I do.

06:49.867 --> 06:54.267
I believe that doing
as a fine a job as you can
pays off in the long run.

07:05.033 --> 07:06.500
I've got a really busy summer.

07:06.533 --> 07:08.500
Lot of really heavy,
physical work.

07:10.333 --> 07:14.167
I'm gonna be working alone
for probably 90% of the time.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.733
All the heavy labour
is gonna be by myself.

07:17.767 --> 07:22.133
So today's project is gonna
be to build what I call
the moveable crane.

07:24.700 --> 07:27.967
NARRATOR: Andy Bassich
is determined to get in
as much building as he can

07:28.000 --> 07:29.800
before winter's darkness
returns.

07:32.167 --> 07:36.667
ANDY: But once I have this
I'll be able to find a million
uses around the yard for this.

07:37.933 --> 07:39.567
I'll be glad
when I have this done,

07:39.600 --> 07:41.600
'cause I'm hoping
my back's gonna hold up.

07:41.633 --> 07:43.433
I'm 56 years old,

07:43.467 --> 07:46.333
and this is a job
for a 20-year-old kid.

07:46.367 --> 07:48.333
Not a 50-year-old guy.

07:49.300 --> 07:50.767
(GRUNTING)

07:56.600 --> 07:58.033
(LAUGHS)

07:59.967 --> 08:02.967
NARRATOR: For Andy,
building a crane by hand
is the first step

08:03.000 --> 08:05.333
in getting his summer
projects done.

08:07.033 --> 08:09.967
ANDY: It's gonna be
a learning process.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.167
It's gonna require
a lot of cutting, welding,
and drilling.

08:16.167 --> 08:18.600
And hopefully
at the end of the day

08:18.633 --> 08:21.133
I'm gonna have something
that I can lift
a thousand pounds with

08:21.167 --> 08:22.567
and roll it around.

08:28.533 --> 08:32.367
I spent the day fabricating
my mobile crane.

08:32.400 --> 08:36.367
A lot of cutting,
and welding,
and drilling of holes,

08:36.400 --> 08:38.800
but all that went pretty well.

08:38.833 --> 08:42.933
Tomorrow will be its test,
and today was a good day
of fabrication.

08:47.300 --> 08:49.267
GLENN: I never came here
for the isolation.

08:49.300 --> 08:53.800
I came here for the
wilderness, for the nature,
for the animals.

08:53.833 --> 08:58.367
I don't think there's anybody
that craves solitary existence
for months at a time.

09:08.700 --> 09:09.733
I'm closing up my cabin.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.033
I'm getting ready
to go on a trip.

09:12.067 --> 09:14.867
I'm gonna go looking for food
in a different location.

09:16.500 --> 09:19.400
This time of year,
it's spring
in the Brooks Range.

09:19.433 --> 09:22.700
For eight and a half months
of the year, this lake
is covered in ice.

09:23.767 --> 09:25.867
And when there's this ice
on it right now

09:25.900 --> 09:28.933
that's actually rotting
from the sun
beating down on it,

09:28.967 --> 09:30.500
it's not safe to walk on it
any more.

09:30.533 --> 09:33.800
It's a difficult time
of the year for me to get food
right here, right now.

09:33.833 --> 09:35.767
If I can find open water
with no ice on it,

09:35.800 --> 09:37.367
I'm gonna have
more opportunities.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.733
So that's what
I'm looking for today.

09:39.767 --> 09:41.967
Okay, I'm gonna
close this door.

09:42.900 --> 09:44.433
I'm not worried
about people now.

09:44.467 --> 09:46.867
It's just to keep
the critters out.

09:52.367 --> 09:56.333
NARRATOR: Glenn Villeneuve
lives isolated and alone
in the Brooks Range,

09:56.367 --> 09:59.533
and finding food from the land
around him is essential
to his survival.

10:01.700 --> 10:04.400
A lot of times it's easier
just to walk barefoot.

10:04.433 --> 10:06.333
Keep the shoes dry for later
when I need them.

10:08.767 --> 10:10.467
Actually get a better grip
on these tussocks

10:10.500 --> 10:12.333
with my bare toes than I do
with those boots.

10:16.033 --> 10:19.833
But I get used to it.
As the summer goes on,
my feet get tougher.

10:22.033 --> 10:24.200
This is a great area.
It looks very promising.

10:24.967 --> 10:26.867
It looks like
it has potential.

10:28.633 --> 10:33.033
Pretty level, dry, I'm close
to water for drinking.

10:35.667 --> 10:37.033
This should be perfect.

10:37.067 --> 10:39.300
Big enough spot for me
to lay down.

10:39.333 --> 10:40.767
Oh, yeah.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.600
Oh, what a view of the sky
with the trees.

10:44.633 --> 10:46.600
I love it.
This is the spot.

10:48.867 --> 10:50.167
I'm more connected to nature.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.567
I'm not just coming out here
for recreation.

10:52.600 --> 10:54.267
Of course it's really
enjoyable,

10:54.300 --> 10:57.133
but I'm using the resources
out here to live.

11:04.900 --> 11:06.400
I got the limbs off this pole,

11:06.433 --> 11:08.900
but it has to be a lot
smoother than it is right now.

11:08.933 --> 11:13.400
Because if it has any of these
little sharp remnants
of branches sticking out,

11:13.433 --> 11:14.967
that can tear the canvas.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.633
I don't wanna poke a hole
in my tent.

11:16.667 --> 11:21.000
So, I'm gonna actually
peel all the bark off of this,

11:21.033 --> 11:23.400
and take off
all those little stubs.

11:23.433 --> 11:26.400
Springtime,
bark comes off easy.

11:26.433 --> 11:28.133
Wintertime, it comes off
a lot harder.

11:34.067 --> 11:36.067
Pole looks pretty good.

11:37.833 --> 11:39.633
The tent doesn't have a floor,
it doesn't need one.

11:39.667 --> 11:42.533
I like to be right
on the ground.
It feels more natural.

11:46.667 --> 11:48.000
Perfect.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.600
Now that I've got my camp
set up, I'm gonna go out,

11:51.633 --> 11:54.400
and I'm gonna look
for some food.

11:54.433 --> 11:58.100
This time of year
the pike like to go into
the shallows, and weedy areas,

11:58.133 --> 11:59.467
and they spawn in there.

11:59.500 --> 12:03.067
So I was thinking
maybe I can spear a fish.

12:03.933 --> 12:05.333
Be kind of interesting.

12:07.667 --> 12:10.667
Okay. So right here
I'm gonna head into
a shallow, weedy area

12:10.700 --> 12:13.367
where I think there could
possibly be some fish.

12:16.633 --> 12:21.100
There's still ice across here,
and this lake ice
is just melting,

12:21.133 --> 12:23.467
so the water is just
above freezing.

12:27.333 --> 12:30.333
I won't be able to stay
in this cold water too long,

12:30.367 --> 12:33.333
but I gotta stay in
long enough to find some fish.

12:35.333 --> 12:37.667
I've done a lot of fishing
with a rod and lure,

12:37.700 --> 12:39.500
but I'd like to be
less dependent on that.

12:39.533 --> 12:41.433
I'd like to be able to
catch fish with a spear.

12:41.467 --> 12:43.800
Something I could possibly
make right here on the spot.

12:46.467 --> 12:48.200
(WHISPERS)
I see a fish right here.

12:59.067 --> 13:00.667
Missed it.

13:00.700 --> 13:04.400
I tell you, this is
more fun than fishing
with a fishing pole. (LAUGHS)

13:06.667 --> 13:08.333
I think I have to get
closer to the fish

13:08.367 --> 13:11.267
before I get too excited
and let the spear fly.

13:11.300 --> 13:12.867
I'm gonna try
and sneak up closer.

13:14.100 --> 13:16.267
I mean, the closer they are,
the better.

13:24.833 --> 13:26.367
Ah! It got away.

13:27.833 --> 13:30.267
I'm actually
very inexperienced
with spearfishing.

13:30.300 --> 13:32.533
I've speared one fish
in my life.

13:32.567 --> 13:35.367
The good thing about it,
the bottom here is weedy.

13:35.400 --> 13:39.100
It's not too stony.
So if I impale this into it,

13:39.133 --> 13:42.167
it's not gonna
dull it too badly.

13:45.233 --> 13:47.667
If it's edible, I'm after it.

13:50.367 --> 13:52.600
Whoa.

13:52.633 --> 13:55.467
It's freaking ice
on the bottom right there
I slipped on.

13:55.500 --> 13:56.933
That water is cold.

13:59.933 --> 14:01.600
My feet are getting
really cold.

14:01.633 --> 14:04.333
Wetness is a real danger
in the summertime.

14:04.367 --> 14:07.000
If it's raining all day
or if I get wet in the water,

14:07.033 --> 14:09.200
I gotta make sure
I get myself warmed up

14:09.233 --> 14:10.700
before I get too cold
to function.

14:19.633 --> 14:20.800
(SIGHS) Missed it.

14:20.833 --> 14:22.333
(CHUCKLES)

14:25.967 --> 14:28.200
This hasn't been
very productive.

14:28.233 --> 14:29.800
I'm getting too cold.

14:29.833 --> 14:31.500
I need to make a fire.

14:34.067 --> 14:37.200
SUE: This is one
of the few places

14:37.233 --> 14:40.133
we have a few more
freedoms to do what you want.

14:45.867 --> 14:48.767
And it's okay to be
wilderness chick.

14:55.400 --> 14:56.733
Dawn of another day.

14:57.400 --> 14:58.533
Um...

14:59.233 --> 15:01.167
Gotta finish up that, uh...

15:01.200 --> 15:04.100
The hydroponic project
that I've been working on.

15:06.333 --> 15:11.267
NARRATOR: In order to avoid
spending $5,000
to fly in fresh produce,

15:11.300 --> 15:13.700
Sue is attempting
to construct her own garden.

15:15.733 --> 15:20.000
SUE: I'm gonna have Rick
working on making couplers,

15:20.033 --> 15:23.233
putting the ends together,
getting the pipe work done.

15:23.267 --> 15:25.533
I need a stand for it,

15:25.567 --> 15:28.700
how I need him to cut
the plywood that I need cut,

15:28.733 --> 15:31.167
and then just trust that
he can do it.

15:31.200 --> 15:33.767
RICK: Sue wants me to build
a hydroponic system.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.767
It's a bunch of pipes
and hoses, and I'm used
to doing that.

15:36.800 --> 15:39.867
-SUE: Over the top?
-Fluff and then over the top.

15:39.900 --> 15:41.700
SUE: I'm taking an old tent,

15:41.733 --> 15:44.933
stripping off
the solid-coloured
tent material.

15:44.967 --> 15:49.767
I ordered up a new greenhouse
type material five plies thick
to go over it.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.233
Next. Sweet. Awesome.

15:57.233 --> 16:00.600
RICK: What?
SUE: I mean, we don't have
enough hose.

16:00.633 --> 16:03.233
We're not gonna have enough.
I can tell you that
right fucking now.

16:03.267 --> 16:06.333
I only got one size
of my tubing.

16:06.367 --> 16:10.367
We have to engineer the return
lines and everything,
'cause I don't have it.

16:10.400 --> 16:13.467
Didn't get the right amount
of tubing that I ordered.

16:15.567 --> 16:17.367
I can't go to the store
and get more.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.967
I'm just getting frustrated
about it.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
I can come up
with a fix later,

16:22.033 --> 16:25.667
but, I mean, we don't have
enough hose,
and I'm out of time.

16:25.700 --> 16:27.900
Right?

16:27.933 --> 16:31.000
I wanted to get
the hydroponics system
done today.

16:31.033 --> 16:33.867
I'm that close to being done.

16:33.900 --> 16:35.900
Now we gotta change
everything around again.

16:35.933 --> 16:38.667
It's time out of my day.
That's a wasted effort.
I don't like that.

16:38.700 --> 16:42.300
I'll do it if I have to,
but it's not optimum.

16:42.333 --> 16:43.467
It's not what I wanna do.

16:45.067 --> 16:46.167
RICK: We need four hoses.

16:46.200 --> 16:48.433
Look.

16:48.467 --> 16:51.200
It's gonna be
so fucking tight.
Do it to your top one.

16:51.233 --> 16:54.900
Yank it up to your top one,
'cause you're gonna have
to have a little slop. Right?

16:54.933 --> 16:56.367
These don't have to reach
the bottom of the tank.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.500
These just have to be
able to drip in.

16:58.533 --> 17:01.367
Yeah, the returns just have
to drip in, but this has
to reach down.

17:01.400 --> 17:04.067
I like to be the boss.
It's good to be the king.

17:04.100 --> 17:06.300
What I say goes
whether it makes sense or not.

17:06.333 --> 17:09.300
-I'm just getting...
-Don't worry about it.

17:09.333 --> 17:12.133
...that frustrated
about the logistical.

17:12.167 --> 17:13.400
Yup.

17:14.233 --> 17:16.133
Mmm, find my happy place.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.067
All right.
I'm good at collecting water.

17:19.100 --> 17:21.000
Should I go do that
instead of being a psycho?

17:21.033 --> 17:23.733
-I don't care.
-All right. You do care.

17:25.700 --> 17:26.967
Thank you, Rick.
I appreciate it.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.633
-No problem.
I'm gonna do...
-I'm not sounding out on you.

17:28.667 --> 17:30.733
-I'm just sounding out on...
-No, I don't take
nothing personally.

17:30.767 --> 17:32.800
...some douchebag that didn't
read the directions
on what I said.

17:32.833 --> 17:35.667
Just as long as
you don't hit me.

17:35.700 --> 17:37.700
You know, people say
I have an issue with control,

17:37.733 --> 17:40.100
and I say as long as
I have it, there is no issue.

17:40.133 --> 17:42.667
So I need to let go
of that a little bit.

17:42.700 --> 17:46.700
We can get the chore done
twice as fast if I let go of
half of the responsibilities.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.100
RICK: Sue's just
getting frustrated.
That's the problem.

17:51.133 --> 17:52.833
Sometimes it doesn't
look like what you want,

17:52.867 --> 17:56.500
but as long as
it's functionable, and that's
all that it has to be.

17:56.533 --> 17:57.567
It'll all work.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.833
CHIP: You teach your kids
how to hunt whether
they're a boy or a girl.

18:04.867 --> 18:07.600
You're making them
self-sufficient.

18:07.633 --> 18:09.933
You know,
you give them exercise,
you give them adventure,

18:09.967 --> 18:12.867
and you give them
really healthy food.

18:12.900 --> 18:15.133
And if they don't connect,
that's okay, too.

18:25.700 --> 18:26.967
(QUTAN LAUGHS)

18:28.267 --> 18:29.667
Come on!

18:29.700 --> 18:32.200
Well, I was sitting at camp,
and I was working
on some stuff,

18:32.233 --> 18:35.000
and Ting started shooting,
and got a wounded caribou.

18:35.033 --> 18:36.733
I'm just catching up
to my girls.

18:36.767 --> 18:40.067
Make sure they're doing
what they're supposed to,
and just keep on the trail.

18:41.933 --> 18:46.100
NARRATOR: 21-year-old Tinmiaq
shot a caribou to provide
for her family.

18:46.133 --> 18:48.933
The law of the tundra
is if you wound an animal,

18:48.967 --> 18:52.833
you honour it
by humanely ending its life.

18:52.867 --> 18:55.633
AGNES: The girls are gonna
push the caribou
back down the hill,

18:55.667 --> 18:59.633
and then the caribou
being wounded will eventually
come down to the flats.

18:59.667 --> 19:03.233
And hopefully come down to me
to where I could
actually shoot it.

19:08.767 --> 19:11.700
The caribou just swam
across the creek,
and it's on the ice.

19:12.367 --> 19:14.967
That's dangerous ice.

19:15.000 --> 19:19.767
Idi, keep going that way,
so it won't come back
up the hill.

19:19.800 --> 19:22.733
This is gonna take
a lot of effort and teamwork.

19:24.833 --> 19:28.833
The caribou is on the ice
right on the other side
of this little hump.

19:28.867 --> 19:30.500
If the caribou sees me,

19:30.533 --> 19:33.067
then it'll get spooked
to the other side.

19:33.100 --> 19:34.133
It'll never cross.

19:35.733 --> 19:39.333
I could shoot it on the ice,
but I don't want to shoot it
on the ice.

19:39.367 --> 19:43.467
I want it to come on land
to where it's safe for us
to get on there.

19:43.500 --> 19:44.733
I don't trust the ice.

19:46.633 --> 19:48.400
It's just not moving.

19:48.433 --> 19:50.700
So I'm just gonna watch it.

19:50.733 --> 19:54.267
Only thing we could do
for now till it gets
to the other side.

20:04.033 --> 20:05.200
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

20:07.567 --> 20:09.267
It's just not moving.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.500
(SPEAKING)

20:36.533 --> 20:37.567
I think you got it.

20:38.433 --> 20:40.100
Fuck, I missed.

20:40.133 --> 20:41.967
TING: Okay, girls.
That means go!

20:42.000 --> 20:43.233
Go, go, go, go!

20:43.267 --> 20:44.433
Don't let it pass.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.267
I need you to tell me
where it go.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.700
It's wounded all right.

20:59.733 --> 21:01.933
Really ain't gonna go
too much farther.

21:01.967 --> 21:04.767
We'll just keep chasing it
till it's down.

21:06.433 --> 21:09.167
GLENN: I have to tolerate
a condition a lot of times

21:09.200 --> 21:10.900
that humans aren't
adapted well to.

21:12.767 --> 21:16.000
Like going four and a half
months without seeing
another human.

21:16.033 --> 21:18.833
I don't care for it,
but I tolerate it better
than most people.

21:25.933 --> 21:30.867
I've got this little fish net
that would be great
for catching whitefish in.

21:30.900 --> 21:34.733
NARRATOR: Earlier,
Glenn attempted to obtain food
by spearfishing,

21:34.767 --> 21:36.433
but came up empty.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.433
Now, he's forced to use
another method.

21:44.067 --> 21:48.067
GLENN: I have to figure out
now how I'm gonna rig the net
out in the water.

21:48.100 --> 21:51.400
Because I don't have
any lead line on the bottom
to hold it down.

21:51.433 --> 21:53.667
So I'm going to have to
improvise on the spot.

21:53.700 --> 21:56.767
And I have to figure out
how to get the net
out into the water,

21:56.800 --> 21:59.300
away from the shore
without a boat.

22:01.367 --> 22:05.133
Now that the ice is thawed,
it makes travel a real chore.

22:07.900 --> 22:09.433
A lot of the ground out here
is wet,

22:09.467 --> 22:11.900
and there isn't much
you can do about it.

22:11.933 --> 22:14.000
I've never had a problem
in the winter

22:14.033 --> 22:16.167
where I felt like I was
in danger of hypothermia.

22:18.567 --> 22:21.367
The most fear I've ever had
of the cold

22:21.400 --> 22:22.967
was in the summer
when I got wet.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.800
And I just kept going.
I thought, "Oh,
I'll get there. I'll warm up."

22:25.833 --> 22:29.133
But actually I kept getting
so cold that my hands
didn't work very well,

22:29.167 --> 22:31.400
and it was almost impossible
to build a fire.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.367
I just lost dexterity
in my fingers.

22:42.733 --> 22:44.733
So it's time to set
this fish net.

22:44.767 --> 22:47.067
I anticipate needing a stake.

22:47.100 --> 22:48.767
I'm not certain how I'm gonna
string the net out there,

22:48.800 --> 22:50.900
but I think I'm just gonna
walk out in the water,

22:50.933 --> 22:52.933
put a stake,
and then tie a rope to it.

22:52.967 --> 22:56.467
In this area,
whitefish may be travelling
along the shoreline,

22:56.500 --> 22:59.533
and I'm just thinking about
where exactly I want
to put the net.

23:03.067 --> 23:04.767
Oh, that water is cold.

23:04.800 --> 23:09.467
Hopefully it doesn't get
very deep, very fast.

23:09.500 --> 23:13.000
As long as it stays shallow
for a ways, I'll be able to
walk out there far enough

23:13.033 --> 23:15.000
that the net will cover
a good territory,

23:15.033 --> 23:17.633
and I'll have a good chance
of getting a fish in it.

23:18.267 --> 23:19.433
Whoa!

23:20.200 --> 23:22.200
(LAUGHS)
Hit that critical point.

23:22.233 --> 23:23.267
Yikes!

23:29.733 --> 23:31.400
Yeah, that's cold water.

23:31.433 --> 23:34.633
Okay, I gotta get moving.
Get this net out there
before I freeze up.

23:36.933 --> 23:40.800
So, one end of the net
is gonna be attached
to the shore.

23:40.833 --> 23:42.700
The other end
is gonna be out here.

23:43.867 --> 23:45.133
I might catch a pike.

23:45.167 --> 23:47.567
I might catch a burbot,
but most likely whitefish.

23:49.000 --> 23:52.600
Whitefish are the ones
I enjoy eating the most
right now.

23:52.633 --> 23:55.167
Put the stones on,
and then I'm gonna get
the hell out of this water.

23:56.033 --> 23:58.533
I don't want the net
drifting up.

23:58.567 --> 23:59.900
Look, that'll hold
that net down.

24:01.667 --> 24:03.433
That should work.

24:03.467 --> 24:04.933
I'm gonna get out of here
and get warmed up.

24:06.200 --> 24:09.667
I got my net out.
Hopefully I'll catch
some fish.

24:09.700 --> 24:12.333
In the meantime,
I'm gonna go get dried out.

24:15.467 --> 24:18.367
ANDY: I like working
with my brain to create
new ideas.

24:18.400 --> 24:22.900
I'm constantly challenging
myself mentally and physically

24:22.933 --> 24:25.967
through my engineering
of projects and inventions.

24:34.333 --> 24:36.233
How much do you think
it weighs, Andy?

24:36.267 --> 24:40.300
-I don't know. Probably
600 or 800 pounds maybe?
-Hooah.

24:40.333 --> 24:44.233
NARRATOR: With only a few
short months before the long
winter's darkness sets in,

24:44.267 --> 24:47.200
Andy worked around the clock
to complete the crane build.

24:47.233 --> 24:49.800
Now it's time to put
his invention to the test.

24:50.933 --> 24:52.533
ANDY: This log is kind of
a test log.

24:52.567 --> 24:55.233
If I can get it to the point
where I can pick this up
comfortably.

24:55.267 --> 24:59.367
It's probably gonna be
lifting more than what
I really need to lift.

25:00.700 --> 25:01.767
(WHIRRING)

25:07.467 --> 25:09.233
Oh, yeah. That came off
the ground pretty quick.

25:15.100 --> 25:17.233
Ooh, that ain't doing it!
(GRUNTS)

25:17.267 --> 25:18.767
Let me try this.

25:20.733 --> 25:21.800
(WHIRRING)

25:21.833 --> 25:22.900
-Whoa!
-Ah!

25:22.933 --> 25:24.233
(ANDY LAUGHS)

25:24.267 --> 25:25.900
Come on, baby.
Come on up.

25:25.933 --> 25:28.233
KATE: No, no, no, no, no.
Don't tip over.

25:28.267 --> 25:30.567
ANDY: All right,
you get on the back.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.400
Did you eat lots of lasagne
last night?

25:32.433 --> 25:34.300
-No, I didn't.
-Well, you should've.

25:34.333 --> 25:35.967
(WHIRRING)

25:39.400 --> 25:40.700
It's coming off the ground.

25:42.033 --> 25:44.400
-Yeah, baby!
-That's the ticket.

25:44.433 --> 25:47.533
The power of Kate!
(LAUGHS)

25:47.567 --> 25:49.933
Okay, this is gonna
come off.

25:49.967 --> 25:52.500
Uh-oh! It's bending.
Bending, bending.

25:56.033 --> 25:58.367
ANDY: I don't know why
the winch isn't locking.

25:59.900 --> 26:02.133
I don't like that.
That's not good.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.067
I want you to go over there
and pivot that back around

26:07.100 --> 26:08.967
so that it gets on there.
Okay?

26:12.700 --> 26:14.433
It's flexing pretty bad.

26:14.467 --> 26:16.067
Oh, my heavens.
It's crumbling.

26:17.533 --> 26:19.967
I don't like the fact
the winch isn't holding
the load.

26:21.900 --> 26:23.400
I'm not really sure
why that is.

26:23.433 --> 26:24.700
It should be holding the load.

26:24.733 --> 26:26.867
I do know that
it can pick the load up.

26:26.900 --> 26:30.500
I think I'm gonna do
a little bit of strengthening
up in the very top up here.

26:32.800 --> 26:36.667
This whole thing is gonna
move a whole lot easier
on a plywood deck.

26:36.700 --> 26:39.033
Oh, okay.
I'll go drop this off.

26:43.233 --> 26:46.533
I'm a little concerned
about the way this pipe
is flexing.

26:46.567 --> 26:49.600
I don't have
the engineering skills
and the math,

26:49.633 --> 26:52.833
and I understand
some of the principles
of the physics behind it,

26:52.867 --> 26:55.900
but obviously if I was
a trained engineer

26:55.933 --> 27:00.033
I'd probably do a better job
of the initial design.

27:00.067 --> 27:03.267
I definitely got some
modifications I gotta do
to this thing.

27:06.400 --> 27:07.600

27:12.667 --> 27:14.200
Oh, my God!

27:15.433 --> 27:16.733
We got a bear.

27:18.600 --> 27:20.100
(CONTINUES SPEAKING)

27:40.000 --> 27:41.700
Why don't you go over
by the sauna, Kate,

27:41.733 --> 27:43.733
and keep an eye out
in that opening.

27:43.767 --> 27:46.967
If he's gonna circle around,
he's gonna come out
in that opening.

28:31.933 --> 28:33.333
He's crouched down.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.500
I'll wait for the bang.

28:35.533 --> 28:36.567
(FIRES)

28:39.233 --> 28:43.100
I think it's time
just to stay away
from this area.

28:43.133 --> 28:46.067
It's best not to go chasing
after him into the woods.

28:46.100 --> 28:48.733
You haven't got an idea
of where they're at.

28:48.767 --> 28:50.067
And you have no advantage.

28:50.100 --> 28:53.367
It's a lot better
just to wait for them
to come in.

28:53.400 --> 28:54.967
For you to know
where they're at,

28:55.000 --> 28:58.267
but them not to know
where you're at
is a much better advantage.

29:04.500 --> 29:06.200
KATE: Well, they're back.

29:10.367 --> 29:11.767
SUE: When I want it, I get it.

29:12.767 --> 29:15.133
If I need it, I procure it.

29:15.167 --> 29:18.567
The world does revolve
around you to a certain
degree out here.

29:36.433 --> 29:39.000
All right. All right.

29:39.033 --> 29:41.200
I gotta say it,
'cause it's part
of my personality.

29:41.233 --> 29:43.767
I threw a snit earlier.

29:43.800 --> 29:47.167
It's not fair for me
to sit here and throw myself
around like a two-year-old

29:47.200 --> 29:48.733
not getting an ice cream cone,

29:48.767 --> 29:52.233
so happy face,
and back to work.

29:56.667 --> 29:59.333
I try not to come from
an emotional place out here,

29:59.367 --> 30:03.500
because being negative
and spending an awful
lot of time alone, you know,

30:03.533 --> 30:05.367
you're gonna go bonkers.

30:05.400 --> 30:09.633
It's like a domino effect,
but, all right,
so I had a fit.

30:09.667 --> 30:11.700
It's over.
Life doesn't have me down.

30:11.733 --> 30:13.633
It's just having fun.

30:13.667 --> 30:15.067
Where are we at?
What are we doing?

30:15.100 --> 30:17.167
You see...
See how it works though?

30:17.200 --> 30:20.267
-It's gonna drain off
into the bucket.
-Okay.

30:20.300 --> 30:22.600
The water comes in
the far end,

30:22.633 --> 30:26.033
out of the barrel,
into this end here.

30:26.067 --> 30:28.900
Flows in at a greater rate
than it's gonna flow out.

30:28.933 --> 30:31.400
It's coming out that end,
so when this fills up,

30:31.433 --> 30:33.967
it'll slowly drain out
back into the barrel.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.933
-There it is. That's it.
-Okay.

30:36.967 --> 30:39.033
Rick came up with a little
tundra engineering.

30:39.067 --> 30:42.500
Just what I needed.
We're gonna flood the pipes.

30:42.533 --> 30:44.233
All right. Well, I'm just
gonna plug it in then.

30:45.900 --> 30:48.467
Hmm. Let's see
if it's running.

30:48.500 --> 30:49.700

30:49.733 --> 30:51.400
RICK: Come on, Tiny Tim, work.

30:51.433 --> 30:54.000
-Oh, there. I hear it.
-Yeah. Yeah, it's pumping.

30:54.033 --> 30:55.867
RICK: Oh, there we go. Yeah.

30:55.900 --> 30:58.800
SUE: Holy schnikes, Batman.

30:58.833 --> 31:01.700
RICK: It's full. Okay,
now you would shut it off.

31:01.733 --> 31:03.033
SUE: Well, it's humming.

31:05.167 --> 31:08.000
As it drains down,
the mat will retain moisture.

31:08.033 --> 31:12.067

will be able to go...

31:28.633 --> 31:30.833

but it's working.

31:34.767 --> 31:36.367
Yay, me!

31:36.400 --> 31:39.000
I should say, "Yay, us."
'Cause Rick was a big help.

31:39.033 --> 31:40.533
Are there little roadblocks?

31:40.567 --> 31:43.233
Yeah, there's little
roadblocks, but I gotta
just create a detour.

31:43.267 --> 31:45.100
You know, it's not that
I can't get to point B.

31:45.133 --> 31:47.300
I just might have to take
a different route.

being in synchronicity
with the season.

31:57.433 --> 32:00.833
This is about having
your timing right
and getting fresh food.

pretty good I think.

32:19.033 --> 32:20.900
...and the girls,
along with Agnes,

32:20.933 --> 32:23.300
pursue the animal
over the vast tundra.

32:24.600 --> 32:27.067
Probably should give it
one more shot.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.567
Go get it, puppy.

you stick to that one animal,

33:09.067 --> 33:12.000
and after I wounded
the animal I stuck to that.

a good deal.

how it's gonna be
to carry meat back.

and tongue,
and brisket, Qutan?

we're up to right now.

33:35.433 --> 33:39.633
But I'm sure he'll know
where we are later.

33:39.667 --> 33:44.000
He'll probably get up
and look around and see us all
huddled in a big circle,

Yeah, I saw the one
walking up the ridge here,

33:53.733 --> 33:55.900
and I didn't wanna blow
your hunt so I waited
until it was up,

33:55.933 --> 33:58.433
and I knew you weren't
gonna shoot.

33:58.467 --> 33:59.533

and helped me.

got this experience

34:34.000 --> 34:37.900
to where they themselves go
chasing after their wounded,

back down the hill,

and then they continue
chasing even though
it went way far.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.067
What's really cool,
is they did it
on their own initiative.

They weren't told to do it.

I don't remember

the good times.

35:10.533 --> 35:12.833

number one,

35:15.533 --> 35:16.900
These are gonna fit in here.

35:16.933 --> 35:21.233

a little bit more.

failed its first test,

Looks like good welds.

35:33.567 --> 35:35.633
I think this'll work.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.733
That's definitely gonna
stiffen this up a lot.

35:37.767 --> 35:40.233
So, see how this
is gonna hang.

35:40.267 --> 35:43.933
Looks like that's still gonna
clear my cable here.

35:43.967 --> 35:46.000
So I think this modification
is done.

35:46.033 --> 35:49.733
I think I'll cut that
winch off, and re-weld
that up a little higher.

36:00.900 --> 36:03.033
Okay, uh,
modifications are done.

36:03.067 --> 36:06.800
I've strengthened up the upper
portion of the boom.

36:06.833 --> 36:08.400
Added some more support
up there.

36:08.433 --> 36:11.300
I don't think it's gonna get
in the way of me
getting this over a wall.

36:11.333 --> 36:15.267
I cut my winch off
and moved it up a little bit,

36:15.300 --> 36:20.000
so I can place more
heavy weight back in here
closer to the wheel.

my modifications
are gonna work.

36:45.667 --> 36:48.833

on that side
so it doesn't tip over?

36:50.067 --> 36:51.200
Thank you.

36:54.567 --> 36:57.600
All right. Here's the test.
Will it pick it up?

37:17.267 --> 37:18.933
All right, it's holding it.

37:27.267 --> 37:28.433
That's good.

37:30.400 --> 37:31.967
If I was on a good
flat surface,

37:32.000 --> 37:34.467
I'd be able to roll that
around, I think,
pretty easily.

(WHIRRING)

37:40.067 --> 37:42.267
Yay!

37:42.300 --> 37:44.900
It was flexing,
but if I can pick this up...

37:44.933 --> 37:48.200
This is heavier than anything
I'm probably gonna have
to pick up.

I've got it working.

37:54.833 --> 37:58.467

is basically taking the place
of two people,

37:58.500 --> 37:59.867
maybe even three.

37:59.900 --> 38:02.467
And it's gonna allow me
to work a lot longer in a day,

38:02.500 --> 38:05.833
'cause I'm not gonna be
exhausted from carrying things

38:05.867 --> 38:07.633
and, uh...
Carrying heavy loads.

38:09.700 --> 38:12.367
This little invention's
gonna save me a lot of time.

38:12.400 --> 38:14.967
It's gonna save me
a lot of back-breaking work,

38:15.000 --> 38:16.467
and it was damn fun to make.

38:20.833 --> 38:22.400

very dramatic here,

38:22.433 --> 38:24.733
because it's a land
of extremes.

38:24.767 --> 38:28.400
And the spring, the thaw,
the break-up,

38:28.433 --> 38:30.667
that's the transition
right there.

It's what keeps life
interesting.

38:39.467 --> 38:41.433
Hopefully I got something
in this net.

38:41.467 --> 38:42.600
I'm gonna take a look now.

38:42.633 --> 38:45.700
There's pike, burbot,
and whitefish.

38:45.733 --> 38:48.033
Any of them could
possibly be in that net.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.300
It's cold.

38:51.333 --> 38:52.433
I'm already cold.

38:52.467 --> 38:54.533
I gotta go in
and check this net.

38:56.367 --> 38:58.500

but it's fun.

It looks like there's a fish
right here.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.167
I got something.

39:09.267 --> 39:10.967
I got a fish.

39:11.833 --> 39:13.667
It's a pike.

39:13.700 --> 39:15.600
Really sharp teeth,

39:15.633 --> 39:18.767
and it's really important
not to get injured
on those teeth.

39:23.167 --> 39:26.267
I got dinner here.

39:26.300 --> 39:29.133
This is a good-sized fish.
That'll make a good meal
for me.

39:29.167 --> 39:31.267
Probably won't even
finish him in one meal.

39:31.300 --> 39:33.400
So that paid off.

39:33.433 --> 39:37.300
I mean, I spent some energy
getting that net out there,
but it's worth it,

39:37.333 --> 39:40.767
and who knows, that might
produce a few more fish
over the next couple of days.

39:49.400 --> 39:50.967
I'm gonna boil this fish.

39:51.000 --> 39:52.200
Keep it simple.

39:52.233 --> 39:55.067
I'm pretty tired,
and if I just throw this
in boiling water,

39:55.100 --> 39:57.300
I don't have to worry
about it.

39:57.333 --> 39:58.767
Isn't that beautiful?

40:00.500 --> 40:02.000
I got a full pot of fish.

40:03.167 --> 40:04.900
That's more than enough
for my dinner.

40:09.933 --> 40:15.033
Oh, this is gonna be
a nice ending to a long day.

40:15.067 --> 40:17.133
Having a little pike
for dinner.

40:17.800 --> 40:19.800
Mmm.

40:19.833 --> 40:22.700
This is powerful food.
I mean, you know it
when you eat this.

40:22.733 --> 40:24.200
This wasn't fast food.

40:24.233 --> 40:27.533
It took a long time to get,
but it's powerful food.

40:33.467 --> 40:36.467
CHIP: This is all
a learning experience,
but it's also adventure.

40:36.500 --> 40:39.133
It's good food,
and it's a good time.

40:40.233 --> 40:42.200
It's healthy for the mind,
body.

40:42.233 --> 40:43.367
It's healthy
all the way around.

40:49.300 --> 40:51.900
AGNES: Today I'm gonna be
working the meat with Carol.

40:51.933 --> 40:54.967
The first thing you do
is sharpen your ulu.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.600
And try not to cut yourself
while you do it.

40:59.167 --> 41:03.333
We're turning this back leg
into shish kabob parts.

41:03.367 --> 41:05.733
We're just gonna cube it up,
and marinate it,

41:05.767 --> 41:08.267
and then we'll put them
on sticks that
the girls carve,

41:08.300 --> 41:10.667
and have some
caribou shish kabob.

41:13.067 --> 41:15.300
-Is your ulu sharp enough?
-Yes.

41:15.333 --> 41:17.367
See what I mean
by having a sharp ulu?

41:17.400 --> 41:21.800
Carol is at the age right now
to where she can control
her ulu, and help.

41:21.833 --> 41:23.667
So, I'm glad
Carol is right here.

41:26.667 --> 41:28.000
You're doing a good job.

41:28.033 --> 41:32.000
Just little cubes, Carol,
and then we'll go
marinate them.

41:40.467 --> 41:43.067
Right now we got one dinner
from this caribou,

41:43.100 --> 41:46.033
and it's gonna get us
about seven more.

41:47.333 --> 41:50.433
CHIP: I made up some kabobs,
and busted up a bunch of ribs.

41:50.467 --> 41:52.933
There's kabobs without onions
if you don't want onions.

41:52.967 --> 41:54.167
There's kabobs with onions.

41:54.200 --> 41:56.100
TING: Some fresh meat
over the barbecue sounds

41:56.133 --> 41:59.700
pretty darn good right now
after a good long day.

41:59.733 --> 42:01.267
We're gonna eat
pretty good tonight.

42:01.300 --> 42:02.533
Oh, yeah.

42:03.367 --> 42:05.233
CHIP: I got some with onions.

42:05.267 --> 42:09.333
I got some with no onions,
but they've all been
marinated.

42:10.833 --> 42:12.767
QUTAN: Are they done?
CHIP: They're done.

42:12.800 --> 42:15.367
-Okay, be careful.
-(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

42:17.633 --> 42:18.733
AGNES:
I'll have the tongue.

42:18.767 --> 42:19.767
(LAUGHS)

42:22.367 --> 42:23.800
CHIP: Carol got the tongue.
CAROL: Thank you.

42:23.833 --> 42:26.933
CHIP: I'm gonna move the ribs.
AGNES: As fresh as
you can get it.

42:26.967 --> 42:28.600
CHIP: It's as fresh as
you can get. That's right.

42:29.767 --> 42:31.967
Thanks to you girls.
A wonderful dinner.

42:32.900 --> 42:33.967
Yup. Team effort.

42:35.300 --> 42:36.767
That was a lot of fun.

42:38.233 --> 42:40.000
Some of the best food
on the planet.

42:40.033 --> 42:41.800
TING: Thank you, guys,
for all helping me.

42:41.833 --> 42:44.133
That would've been hard work
if I had to do it by myself.

42:44.167 --> 42:45.667
-(LAUGHS) Yeah.
-And I know that work.

42:45.700 --> 42:47.667
So I know
that's the truth.

42:47.700 --> 42:50.267
But the fact is,
this is success,

42:50.300 --> 42:53.467
-and this is...
This is excellent.
-Healthiest and the best.

42:53.500 --> 42:55.500
Yup. Good lean meat.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.067
Thanks.

42:57.100 --> 42:58.133
(ALL LAUGH)
