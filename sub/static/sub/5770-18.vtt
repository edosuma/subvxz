BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT I
NEVER BLAMED YOU FOR ANYTHING.

IT'S TOTALLY NOT MY FAULT.

I'M SORRY.

01:46.149 --> 01:48.934
I BAKED THIS HUMBLE PIE
IN THE FERVENT HOPE

01:48.978 --> 01:50.022
THAT WE COULD BE FRIENDS.

01:50.066 --> 01:51.937
IT'S RAZZLEBERRY,
ACTUALLY,

01:51.981 --> 01:54.592
BUT I WAS VERY HUMBLE THROUGHOUT
THE WHOLE BAKING PROCESS.

01:54.636 --> 01:56.507
IF YOU COULD JUST FIND IT
IN YOUR HEART

01:56.551 --> 02:00.424
TO FORGIVE
THE LIKES OF ME.

02:00.468 --> 02:01.599

02:33.936 --> 02:34.893
I THINK THAT'S
A POOP PIE.

02:34.937 --> 02:36.417
THERE'S NOT ANY POOP
IN THAT PIE!

THAT IS
A DYING INDUSTRY.

CAN BRING IN THE COPS.

06:45.100 --> 06:47.276
WELL, I'M SORRY
TO HEAR THAT SAD TALE,

06:59.375 --> 07:02.291
FINE, GUYS.
I'LL TALK TO STEVIE.

07:02.334 --> 07:03.553
[exhales]

07:03.597 --> 07:05.686
AND, DANNY,
SINCE YOU'RE NOT A DRUG ADDICT,

07:05.729 --> 07:06.774
IT WOULD BE GREAT
IF YOU COULD PAY

07:06.817 --> 07:09.385
FOR YOUR SHARE
OF THE INTERVENTION!

07:11.300 --> 07:14.956
I DON'T KNOW, D.
THIS PLACE FEELS TOO FANCY.

07:14.999 --> 07:16.261
STEVIE, I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU

07:16.305 --> 07:17.698
ABOUT THE TREATMENT
I'VE BEEN GIVING YOU.

07:17.741 --> 07:18.699
OH, YEAH, LISTEN.

07:18.742 --> 07:19.917
TEACH ME TO SCALP
MAROON 5 TICKETS

07:19.961 --> 07:21.049
ON ANOTHER GUY'S TURF.

07:21.092 --> 07:22.703
SOME OF THE DOCTORS
AT THE PRACTICE

07:22.746 --> 07:24.531
AREN'T TOO CRAZY
ABOUT OUR ARRANGEMENT,

07:24.574 --> 07:26.489
STEVIE.

07:26.533 --> 07:29.318
WHICH ONE?
THE INDIAN GIRL? ENGLISH?

07:29.361 --> 07:30.754
JUST TELL THEM
WE GO WAY BACK.

07:30.798 --> 07:32.800
THEY'RE CONCERNED
FROM A LEGAL ASPECT.

07:32.843 --> 07:34.236
THE LAW?
YEAH.

07:34.279 --> 07:37.500
TAXPAYERS ARE BAILING OUT
THESE BANK WHATEVERS,

07:37.544 --> 07:39.110
AND THEY'RE WORRIED
ABOUT ONE BEST FRIEND

07:39.154 --> 07:41.025
GIVING ANOTHER BEST FRIEND
SOME LITTLE PILLS?

07:41.069 --> 07:43.637
OKAY, CALM DOWN.
LOOK AT ME, OKAY?

07:43.680 --> 07:45.334
FORGET I EVEN SAID IT.
NO BIG DEAL.

07:45.377 --> 07:47.118
I JUST DON'T LIKE THE WAY
THAT THESE OTHER DOCTORS

07:47.162 --> 07:48.380
ARE PUSHING YOU AROUND.

07:48.424 --> 07:50.687
IT'S LIKE THE GARGANO BROTHERS
USED TO.

07:50.731 --> 07:52.341
[groans]
YOU OKAY?

07:52.384 --> 07:54.212
I COULD REALLY USE
A REFILL ON THE VIC.

07:54.256 --> 07:55.562
SHOULDER'S STILL
GIVING ME HELL.

07:55.605 --> 07:56.780
WILL YOU JUST GIVE ME
THE VIC, PLEASE?

07:56.824 --> 07:57.955
[exhales]

07:57.999 --> 07:59.870
PLEASE?
YEAH.

07:59.914 --> 08:01.350
I'LL GET YOU SOME MORE.

08:01.393 --> 08:02.656
HEY, THANKS, DUDE.
THAT REALLY MEANS A LOT.

08:02.699 --> 08:06.355
AND, LISTEN, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THOSE OTHER DOCTORS.

08:06.398 --> 08:08.879
CAN I GET A LITTLE CRUSHED RED
ON THIS CARDBOARD?

08:11.578 --> 08:13.536
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THEY FEEL KIND OF WEIRD,

08:13.580 --> 08:14.929
BUT THEN AGAIN,
I RUN WEIRD,

08:14.972 --> 08:15.930
SO MAYBE THAT'S NORMAL?

08:15.973 --> 08:17.540
YEAH, OKAY.

08:17.584 --> 08:21.109
YOUR FORM IS--
DAMN.

08:21.152 --> 08:22.763
OKAY, THAT IS ENOUGH.

08:22.806 --> 08:24.329
I HAVE SIGNED UP FOR, LIKE,
THREE 10Ks, I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW.

08:24.373 --> 08:26.288
JUST PLEASE GET ME THESE
IN, LIKE, PINK?

08:26.331 --> 08:28.029
YEAH.

08:28.072 --> 08:29.552
HEY, THERE.
HELLO.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.032
GOOD JOB WALKING
IN THAT STRAIGHT LINE.

08:31.075 --> 08:32.468
THANK YOU.
CAN I HELP YOU?

08:32.512 --> 08:33.904
YOU'RE ONE
OF THOSE RITZY DOCTORS

08:33.948 --> 08:36.341
THAT WORKS OVER
AT SHULMAN AND ASSOCIATES?I AM.

08:36.385 --> 08:37.473
YOU MUST THINK
YOU'RE SO GREAT,

08:37.517 --> 08:38.996
STRUTTING AROUND
IN YOUR FANCY CLOTHES.

08:39.040 --> 08:40.171
NO, I DON'T.

08:40.215 --> 08:42.347
PROBABLY SPENT A FORTUNE
ON SHAMPOO

08:42.391 --> 08:43.610
ON ACCOUNT
OF YOUR SHINY HAIR.

08:43.653 --> 08:44.741
THANK YOU,
I DO SPEND

08:44.785 --> 08:46.221
A FORTUNE ON MY SHAMPOO
AND CONDITIONER.

08:46.264 --> 08:49.006
HMM.

08:51.226 --> 08:52.357
WHAT, DO YOU WANT ME

08:52.401 --> 08:55.230
TO PUT YOUR SHOE ON
FOR YOU, CINDERELLA?

08:55.273 --> 08:57.580
OKAY.

08:57.624 --> 09:00.888
OKAY, I'LL DO THAT.

09:00.931 --> 09:02.324
WOW, YOU GOT
REAL WIDE FEET.

09:02.367 --> 09:05.762
THANK YOU.
I ALMOST NEVER FALL DOWN.

09:05.806 --> 09:07.634
YOU KNOW, I'M LIKE 0 FOR 100
WITH THIS ONE,

09:07.677 --> 09:12.029
BUT DO YOU WANNA GO GET
SOME ICE CREAM?

09:14.423 --> 09:16.643
[Mindy]
I MET THIS REALLY
CHARMING GUY YESTERDAY.

09:16.686 --> 09:18.601
WE HAD AN IMPROMPTU DATE,
AND WE MADE OUT LIKE CRAZY.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.037
IT'S KIND OF FUNNY,
ACTUALLY,

09:20.081 --> 09:22.039
BECAUSE HE'S NOT
THE KIND OF TYPE OF GUY

09:22.083 --> 09:23.040
THAT I USUALLY
GO FOR.

09:23.084 --> 09:25.390
METROSEXUAL CHEESE BALLS?
HEY.

09:25.434 --> 09:27.131
WANNA SEE A PICTURE?YEP.

09:27.175 --> 09:28.176
LET'S GET A LOOK
AT THIS GUY.

09:28.219 --> 09:29.438
MM-HMM.

09:29.481 --> 09:30.613
[chuckles]
RIGHT?

09:30.657 --> 09:32.876
NO. DR. C? DR. C?YEAH.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.225
DR. C, YOU SHOULD SEE
THIS GUY.

09:34.269 --> 09:36.053
NO INTEREST WHATSOEVER.

09:36.097 --> 09:38.186
NO, NO, NO,
THIS GUY IS A HOT HUNK.

09:38.229 --> 09:39.579
LOOK. LOOK AT HIM.DOESN'T HE LOOK LIKE HE'S--

09:39.622 --> 09:41.624
[Morgan]
LOOK AT HIM.
LOOK AT THIS GUY.

09:41.668 --> 09:44.714
WOW.

09:44.758 --> 09:46.063

WITH THAT GUY?

09:46.107 --> 09:47.543
MM-HMM, AND NEXT WEEKEND,

09:47.587 --> 09:49.197
WE'RE GOING TO HIS LITTLE
COUSIN'S FIRST COMMUNION.

09:49.240 --> 09:52.243
HE TOLD ME TO BRING
A CASH GIFT.

09:52.287 --> 09:53.854
TICKETS, TICKETS,
WHO NEEDS TICKETS?

09:53.897 --> 09:55.638
PRINCESSES ON ICE.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.727
SNOW WHITE, BELLE,
THE CHINESE ONE.

09:57.771 --> 09:59.468
[cell phone rings]

09:59.511 --> 10:01.339
HEY.
HEY, LITTLE D!

10:01.383 --> 10:02.993
HEY, YOU KNOW ANY LITTLE GIRLS
WHO WANNA SEE SOME CAPADES?

10:03.037 --> 10:04.516
STEVIE, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING.

10:04.560 --> 10:05.909
DID YOU ASK
MY CO-WORKER OUT?

10:05.953 --> 10:07.345
WELL, YOU TOLD ME SHE WAS
GIVING YOU SOME TROUBLE--

10:07.389 --> 10:08.608
YO!

10:08.651 --> 10:10.261
SO I WENT DOWN TO TALK
SOME SENSE INTO HER.

10:10.305 --> 10:12.786
NEXT THING I KNOW, WE'RE
DEBATING NUTS VERSUS SPRINKLES.

10:12.829 --> 10:14.178
I GOT TICKETS.
I GOT QUALITY TICKETS.

10:14.222 --> 10:15.440
STEVIE, YOU GOTTA END IT.

10:15.484 --> 10:16.964
HELL, NO.

10:17.007 --> 10:18.530
COULD YOU IMAGINE ME WITH
A LITTLE LADY DOCTOR FRIEND?

10:18.574 --> 10:19.836
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO ASK YOU
FOR PILLS NO MORE.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.577
ARIEL--
BUSTING OUT OF HER SHELLS.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.665
OKAY, OKAY, STEVIE.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.711
YOU WANT IT? ALL RIGHT.
SURE.

10:24.754 --> 10:25.755
[Danny]
YOU GOTTA LISTEN TO ME.
I NEED YOU TO LISTEN TO ME.

10:25.799 --> 10:26.800
I GOTTA GO, I GOTTA GO.
I GOT A GUY.

10:26.843 --> 10:27.627
STE--YOU GONNA END IT
WITH HER?

10:27.670 --> 10:29.890
I GOTTA GO.STE--

10:29.933 --> 10:31.500
200.
NOPE.

10:31.543 --> 10:33.763
ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME 75.

10:33.807 --> 10:34.764
HERE YOU GO.
YEAH.

10:34.808 --> 10:36.636
YOU CAN'T GO OUT
WITH THIS GUY.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.072
LOOK, DANNY, I GET THAT YOU'RE
OBSESSED WITH MY LOVE LIFE,

10:38.115 --> 10:39.116
BUT I'M DOING WORK NOW.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.117
YOU CAN'T GO OUT
WITH THIS GUY

10:40.161 --> 10:42.685
'CAUSE HE'S STEVIE.

10:42.729 --> 10:44.078
STEVIE IS STEPHEN?

10:44.121 --> 10:45.253
MY STEPHEN?
STEVEN.

10:45.296 --> 10:46.297
STEPHEN.

10:46.341 --> 10:47.429
I GREW UP WITH HIM.
IT'S STEVEN.

10:47.472 --> 10:48.822
I MADE OUT WITH HIM.
IT'S--OKAY.

10:48.865 --> 10:49.910
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT, YEAH.IT DOESN'T MATTER.

10:49.953 --> 10:50.824
THE POINT IS
HE ONLY APPROACHED YOU,

10:50.867 --> 10:51.825
SO HE CAN INTIMIDATE YOU

10:51.868 --> 10:52.826
AND GET YOU TO BACK OFF.

10:52.869 --> 10:54.088
OH, GOD.

10:54.131 --> 10:55.350
DANNY, I LET HIM
GRAB MY ASS

10:55.393 --> 10:56.351
AT THE ICE CREAM STORE.

10:56.394 --> 10:57.787
[exhales]
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

10:57.831 --> 10:59.049
I TAUGHT HIM
THAT MOVE.

10:59.093 --> 11:00.485
WE ARE DEALING
WITH A REAL PSYCHOPATH HERE.

11:00.529 --> 11:01.661
I MEAN,
YOU CUT HIM OFF,

11:01.704 --> 11:02.705
AND THE FIRST THING
HE DECIDES TO DO

11:02.749 --> 11:04.228
IS GO
AND SEDUCE YOUR CO-WORKER?

11:04.272 --> 11:05.534
WE HAVE TO CALL
THE POLICE.

11:05.577 --> 11:06.927
OKAY, WAIT, NO.
HOLD ON A SECOND.

11:06.970 --> 11:07.928
ONE SECOND, ONE SECOND,
'CAUSE I HAVEN'T--

11:07.971 --> 11:09.190
GIVE ME THAT.

11:09.233 --> 11:12.193
I HAVEN'T OFFICIALLY,

11:12.236 --> 11:15.196
TECHNICALLY
CUT HIM OFF YET.

11:15.239 --> 11:16.980
I'M SORRY,
WHAT WERE YOU DOING

11:17.024 --> 11:19.069
WHEN YOU TOLD US THAT YOU
WERE GONNA GO CUT HIM OFF?

11:19.113 --> 11:20.723
WE WERE EATING PIZZA,

11:20.767 --> 11:22.333
AND IT JUST...
[groans]

11:22.377 --> 11:24.118
THE AMBIENCE OF THE PLACE,
IT JUST WASN'T RIGHT.

11:24.161 --> 11:26.163
OH, THE AMBIENCE
IN THE RESTAURANT WASN'T RIGHT?NO.

11:26.207 --> 11:27.904
IT WASN'T EXACTLY
THE RIGHT MOMENT

11:27.948 --> 11:29.340
TO TELL YOUR FRIEND
THAT YOU CAN'T GIVE HIM

11:29.384 --> 11:31.168
ILLEGAL DRUGS ANYMORE?

11:31.212 --> 11:33.475
DAMN IT, DANNY.WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:33.518 --> 11:35.869
YOU DID NOT HAVE THE GUTS
TO BE DIRECT WITH YOUR FRIEND,

11:35.912 --> 11:37.131
SO NOW, I HAVE TO GO
TAKE CARE OF IT.

11:37.174 --> 11:38.785
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

11:38.828 --> 11:40.047
I'M GOING
TO STATEN ISLAND.

11:40.090 --> 11:42.702
NOW? WAIT A MINUTE.
MINDY.

11:45.095 --> 11:47.271
[exhales]
MORGAN HAS TO COME TOO?

11:47.315 --> 11:49.230
I HAVE NEVER BEEN
TO STATEN ISLAND,

11:49.273 --> 11:50.797
AND I INTEND
ON RETURNING ALIVE.

11:50.840 --> 11:51.841
ALL RIGHT--
WHOA, WHOA.

11:51.885 --> 11:53.190
CAN YOU NOT CHANGE
IN FRONT OF ME?

11:53.234 --> 11:54.365
CAN YOU NOT LOOK AT ME

11:54.409 --> 11:56.324
WHEN I'M CHANGING?I'M--I'M--

11:56.367 --> 11:57.325
[sighs]

11:57.368 --> 11:59.762
[knocks at door]I GOT IT.

11:59.806 --> 12:00.763
HEATHER, HI.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.373
OH, HEY.
I KNOW YOU.

12:02.417 --> 12:03.592
YOU'RE THE GUY
FROM THE CHRISTMAS PARTY.

12:03.635 --> 12:06.334
YES, AND MY TEXTS.

12:06.377 --> 12:08.249
I NOTICED YOU CHANGED
YOUR NUMBER.

12:08.292 --> 12:10.991
YEAH.
YEAH.

12:11.034 --> 12:12.775
COME IN.THANKS.

12:12.819 --> 12:13.776
[Danny]
HOW YOU DOIN'?

12:13.820 --> 12:15.996
OH.
HEY.

12:16.039 --> 12:17.214
HEY, MINDY.

12:17.258 --> 12:19.260
I BAKED YOU
THIS "NEW NEIGHBOR" CAKE,

12:19.303 --> 12:21.915
BUT EVENTS
HAVE RENDERED IT OBSOLETE.

12:21.958 --> 12:23.133
I DIDN'T GET
THE APARTMENT.

12:23.177 --> 12:25.005
OH, NO.

12:25.048 --> 12:26.093
YEAH.
IT'S WEIRD.

12:26.136 --> 12:27.485
I HAD THE APARTMENT,
AND THEN SUDDENLY,

12:27.529 --> 12:29.009
THEY WERE LIKE,
"SO LONG."

12:29.052 --> 12:30.271
NO EXPLANATION?

12:30.314 --> 12:32.012
IT'S LIKE
THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE GUTS

12:32.055 --> 12:34.710
TO BE DIRECT WITH YOU.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.538
SOME PEOPLE.

12:36.581 --> 12:38.540
WELL, DANNY, APARTMENTS
AND ILLEGAL NARCOTICS

12:38.583 --> 12:39.628
ARE VERY DIFFERENT THINGS.

12:39.671 --> 12:42.152
WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

12:42.196 --> 12:43.719
LISTEN UP,
COPPER TOP.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.068
AS LONG
AS I'M ALIVE,

12:45.112 --> 12:46.287
YOU WILL HAVE A ROOF
OVER YOUR HEAD.

12:46.330 --> 12:48.289
LOOK AT THAT,
THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS.

12:48.332 --> 12:49.681
YES, THIS BUILDING
DIDN'T WORK OUT,

12:49.725 --> 12:51.161
BUT THERE'S PLENTY
OF GREAT PLACES IN MANHATTAN.

12:51.205 --> 12:53.555
ACTUALLY, MY MOM WANTS ME
TO MOVE BACK TO DELAWARE,

12:53.598 --> 12:55.252
WHICH MIGHT NOT BE
SUCH A BAD IDEA.

12:55.296 --> 12:56.732
YOU KNOW,
SHE HAS BASIC CABLE.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.168
WELL, SOME CHANNELS.

12:58.212 --> 13:00.257
IT'S THE SMALLEST PACKAGE.

13:00.301 --> 13:01.563
BUT THANKS
FOR EVERYTHING.

13:01.606 --> 13:02.825
YEAH, OF COURSE.
I'M GONNA GO FINISH CHANGING.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.740
OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT.
YOU SHOULD GO TALK TO HER.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.089
JUST TELL HER THE TRUTH.
I--

13:06.133 --> 13:10.137
HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
SHE HAS SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.

13:10.180 --> 13:12.530
I HAVE A CONFESSION
TO MAKE TO YOU, HEATHER.

13:12.574 --> 13:14.576
I SENT AN ANONYMOUS LETTER
TO THE BOARD

13:14.619 --> 13:16.143
SAYING THAT YOU ARE
A TERRIBLE PERSON,

13:16.186 --> 13:19.624
AND THAT IS WHY
YOUR APPLICATION WAS REJECTED.

13:19.668 --> 13:21.539
BUT I BAKED YOU
A PIE.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.759
YEAH, AND I KICKED IT,

13:23.803 --> 13:24.891
AND THEN I ATE IT.

13:24.934 --> 13:26.849
YOU STOLE
MY APARTMENT

13:26.893 --> 13:28.895
LIKE YOU STOLE
MY BOYFRIEND!

13:28.938 --> 13:31.158
[Morgan]
OKAY, RELAX.
EVERYONE, RELAX.

13:31.201 --> 13:32.246
WHOA!

13:32.289 --> 13:33.551

13:33.595 --> 13:35.292

13:35.336 --> 13:36.903
[Mindy]
OH, MY GOD!
OH, GOD!

13:36.946 --> 13:40.907
[all shouting]

13:40.950 --> 13:43.170
[Mindy]
GET HER IN THE SHOWER!
GET HER IN THE SHOWER!

13:43.213 --> 13:45.346
[Morgan]
COOL IT, MAMA!
COOL IT, MAMA!

13:45.389 --> 13:48.131
[shower runs][sighs]

13:48.175 --> 13:49.829
[Morgan] ALL RIGHT.[sighs]

13:49.872 --> 13:52.222
MARTY,
IT WAS I WHO WROTE

13:52.266 --> 13:53.876
THAT ANONYMOUS LETTER
ABOUT HEATHER.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.965
I WAS ANGRY AT HER 'CAUSE
WE WERE DATING THE SAME GUY.

13:56.009 --> 13:58.272
HEY, HEY, HEY, YOUNG MAN.I APOLOGIZE.

13:58.315 --> 13:59.882
I JUST WANTED TO SEE
WHAT IT FELT LIKE

13:59.926 --> 14:01.188
WITH HIM FLAPPING AROUND
IN MY SHIRT.

14:01.231 --> 14:02.711
I'M SORRY.
SORRY.

14:02.754 --> 14:03.973
I APOLOGIZE, SIR.

14:04.017 --> 14:06.193
I'M SORRY,
BUT I'M STILL NOT SURE

14:06.236 --> 14:07.585
YOU'RE THE RIGHT FIT.

14:07.629 --> 14:10.153
I MEAN, THE FIGHT,
YOU'RE WET FOR SOME REASON--

14:10.197 --> 14:12.939
WELL, THEY JUST THREW ME
IN THE SHOWER TO CALM ME DOWN.

14:12.982 --> 14:14.679
IT'S OKAY.
I HAVE A REALLY BAD TEMPER.

14:14.723 --> 14:16.072
MY PSYCHIATRIST BLAMES IT
ON MY RED HAIR.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.508
NO, WAIT, MARTY.

14:17.552 --> 14:19.206
I KNOW THAT YOU WERE LOOKING
FOR THE PERFECT TENANT,

14:19.249 --> 14:20.816
BUT A PERFECT TENANT
JUST DOESN'T EXIST.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.862
THERE'S JUST PEOPLE
WHO PRETEND TO BE NORMAL

14:22.905 --> 14:23.863
UNTIL WE APPROVE
THEIR APPLICATION,

14:23.906 --> 14:25.473
AND THEN
THEY MOVE IN.

14:25.516 --> 14:26.822
THAT'S SO TRUE.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.389
THE CUTE, OLD LADY
IN THE APARTMENT ABOVE ME--

14:28.432 --> 14:30.565
MUMMIFIED HUSBAND,
15 YEARS.

14:30.608 --> 14:33.307
OKAY, HEATHER WOULD BE
A MUCH BETTER TENANT THAN ME.

14:33.350 --> 14:35.135
MARTY, IT'S TIME
YOU LEARNED THE TRUTH.

14:35.178 --> 14:37.224
I AM THE PERSON THAT HAS BEEN
TAKING PEOPLE'S LAUNDRY

14:37.267 --> 14:38.355
OUT OF THE DRYER
THE SECOND IT BEEPS.

14:38.399 --> 14:40.836
WAIT,
YOU'RE THE DRYER BANDIT?

14:40.880 --> 14:43.186
YEAH.

14:43.230 --> 14:45.362
WELL, I SUPPOSE
I HAVE A FEW MORE BIRDS

14:45.406 --> 14:47.974
THAN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH
WOULD RECOMMEND,

14:48.017 --> 14:49.192
SO ALL RIGHT, HEATHER.

14:49.236 --> 14:52.282
I'LL GIVE YOUR APPLICATION
ANOTHER LOOK-OVER.

14:52.326 --> 14:53.501
[Mindy] UH, DANNY?

14:53.544 --> 14:55.242
I THINK YOU AND I
HAVE A FERRY TO CATCH.

14:55.285 --> 14:57.679
I'M NOT GOING TO STATEN
LOOKING LIKE THIS.

14:57.722 --> 14:59.202
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.857
THERE'S NO WAY THEY COULD DRESS
ME LIKE CINDERELLA, RIGHT?

15:01.901 --> 15:03.250
NO, IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.NO. YEAH, NOT POSSIBLE.

15:03.293 --> 15:04.555
THAT'S IN THE CARTOON.

15:04.599 --> 15:06.688
YEAH, YEAH.

15:06.731 --> 15:08.385
[Mindy]
DANNY, THE STATUE OF LIBERTY,

15:08.429 --> 15:10.083
SHE'S, LIKE, LEGIT HOT.
DANNY?

15:10.126 --> 15:11.649
HEY, DANNY, YOU'RE A GUY.
HMM?

15:11.693 --> 15:12.650
STATUE OF LIBERTY.

15:12.694 --> 15:15.392
[exhales]
ALL RIGHT.

15:15.436 --> 15:17.699
KINDA LOOKS
LIKE TILDA SWINTON.

15:17.742 --> 15:19.309
I NEVER WANTED
TO BE THAT GUY

15:19.353 --> 15:21.398
WHO MAKES IT
AND FORGETS WHERE HE CAME FROM.

15:21.442 --> 15:22.704
YOU'RE DEFINITELY
NOT THAT GUY.

15:22.747 --> 15:24.575
YOU'RE CONSTANTLY TELLING US
ABOUT STATEN ISLAND.

15:24.619 --> 15:25.968
I KNOW SO MUCH
ABOUT THE VERRAZANO BRIDGE.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.448
WE USED TO MAKE FUN
OF THE GUYS WHO LEFT.

15:27.491 --> 15:29.232
"TOO GOOD FOR THE ISLAND GUYS"
IS WHAT WE'D CALL 'EM.

15:29.276 --> 15:30.842
OH, MY GOD.IT'S NOT THAT CREATIVE.

15:30.886 --> 15:32.148
YEAH, I DON'T WANT
THAT TITLE, OKAY?

15:32.192 --> 15:34.063
UGH.MORGAN, GET OFF OF ME!

15:34.107 --> 15:35.064
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE MY BODYGUARD.

15:35.108 --> 15:37.066
I CAN'T GET
MY SEA LEGS.

15:37.110 --> 15:38.241
I'M GONNA--I'M GONNA LAY DOWN.
[groans]

15:38.285 --> 15:39.808
I'M SORRY.

15:39.851 --> 15:41.157
I SHOULDN'T HAVE BROUGHT HIM.
YOU WERE RIGHT.

15:41.201 --> 15:42.767
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I COULDN'T HANDLE STEVIE.

15:42.811 --> 15:44.769
DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:44.813 --> 15:46.206
IF YOU GUYS HAD NOT BEEN
IN MY APARTMENT TODAY,

15:46.249 --> 15:48.686
THERE IS NO WAY THAT I
WOULD'VE TOLD HEATHER THE TRUTH.

15:48.730 --> 15:50.210
IT'S HARD.
IT'S HARD TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

15:50.253 --> 15:51.428
THAT'S WHY IT'S GOOD
TO HAVE PEOPLE AROUND YOU.

15:51.472 --> 15:52.690
THEY KIND OF FORCE YOU
TO DO IT.

15:52.734 --> 15:53.691
[Morgan groans]

15:53.735 --> 15:54.779
THANKS, MIN.

15:54.823 --> 15:56.868
[Morgan] MIN? MIN?

15:56.912 --> 15:58.218
YOU THINK STEVIE'S
GONNA BE OKAY WITH THIS?

15:58.261 --> 15:59.262
HE'LL BE OKAY WITH THIS.
YES!

15:59.306 --> 16:00.611
YOU'RE SUCH
A DRAMA QUEEN.

16:00.655 --> 16:02.048
JUST STOP GETTING UPSET
ABOUT THIS.

16:02.091 --> 16:03.310
I'M NOT UPSET.
I WAS JUST WONDERING.

16:03.353 --> 16:04.311
YES, HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

16:04.354 --> 16:05.573
HE'LL BE FINE, YEAH.HE LOVES YOU.

16:05.616 --> 16:06.487
JUST TELL HIM THE TRUTH,
AND HE'LL UNDERSTAND.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.445
DISLOYAL SON OF A BITCH.

16:08.489 --> 16:09.838
YOU CUT
YOUR BEST FRIEND OFF

16:09.881 --> 16:11.144
FROM PAIN PILLS
WHEN HE NEEDS THEM?

16:11.187 --> 16:12.928
OKAY, STEVIE,
LET'S JUST TALK THIS OUT.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.756
YES, AND DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY TO ME, STEVEN?

16:14.799 --> 16:16.932
I'M SORRY THAT I LIED
TO YOU, SWEETHEART,

16:16.976 --> 16:19.195
BUT THAT HAND ON YOUR ASS,
THAT WAS REAL.

16:19.239 --> 16:20.631
FOR THE RECORD,
YOU STOLE MY MOVE.

16:20.675 --> 16:22.155
YOU WISH
IT WAS YOUR MOVE.

16:22.198 --> 16:23.721
YOU STOLE IT.GET OVER HERE, SO I CAN--

16:23.765 --> 16:24.722
COME HERE!

16:24.766 --> 16:26.246
STEVIE!NO!

16:26.289 --> 16:29.118
BRING IN MY SUN TEA,

16:29.162 --> 16:30.424

16:30.467 --> 16:31.686
DANNY CASTELLANO,

16:31.729 --> 16:33.079
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN YEARS!

16:33.122 --> 16:35.081
HOW ARE YOU, SWEETHEART?
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE.

16:35.124 --> 16:36.473
YEAH, THEY GOTTA GO, MA.WAIT A MINUTE!

16:36.517 --> 16:38.214
I KNOW
WHO YOU ARE.

16:38.258 --> 16:39.781
YOU'RE STEVIE'S
NEW AFRICAN-AMERICAN GIRLFRIEND.

16:39.824 --> 16:41.739
OH, HOW NICE
TO MEET YOU.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.480
PLEASE, COME IN,

16:43.524 --> 16:45.613
EVEN THE BARFING GIANT

16:45.656 --> 16:46.831
[Morgan vomits]

16:46.875 --> 16:48.311
YOU STAY.
COME ON, THE BASEMENT'S AWESOME.

16:48.355 --> 16:51.184
YOU GUYS GO IN.
SEA LEGS ARE NOT COMING BACK.

16:54.317 --> 16:56.972
YOU KNOW,
STEVIE'S REALLY KEEN ON YOU.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.626
MAYBE YOU HAVE
A LITTLE SICILIAN IN YOU?

16:58.669 --> 17:01.368
NO, NO, SHE'S JUST MY COLLEAGUE,
MRS. GUARANCI--

17:01.411 --> 17:04.284

17:04.327 --> 17:06.242
DANNY SETTING UP
HIS OLD FRIEND.

17:06.286 --> 17:08.375
LISTEN, TELL ME
ALL ABOUT YOURSELF, NOW, DANNY.

17:08.418 --> 17:09.593
[Stevie]
OH, I'LL TELL YOU
ALL ABOUT HIM, MA.

17:09.637 --> 17:11.073
HE'S A BIG SHOT DOCTOR

17:11.117 --> 17:12.640
WHO DRESSES
LIKE CHURCH EVERY DAY

17:12.683 --> 17:14.381
AND EATS FANCY PIZZA.

17:14.424 --> 17:15.425
ALL RIGHT,
ENOUGH WITH THE PIZZA.

17:15.469 --> 17:16.687
ENOUGH WITH YOUR FACE!

17:16.731 --> 17:19.342
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK
WOULD BE REALLY FUN?

17:19.386 --> 17:21.605
MRS. GU--

SOME PHOTOS OF LITTLE STEVIE.

17:23.607 --> 17:24.956
YOU KNOW,
FROM GROWING UP.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.785
OH, YOU WANNA SEE
WHAT YOUR BABIES WILL LOOK LIKE.

17:27.829 --> 17:29.178
MM-HMM.

17:29.222 --> 17:30.832
WHAT ARE YOU--WHAT--NO. MA, WHERE YOU GOING?

17:30.875 --> 17:31.833
TAKE CARE OF THIS,
SO WE CAN GET OFF

17:31.876 --> 17:32.834
THIS GODFORSAKEN ISLAND.

17:32.877 --> 17:33.835
THIS WASN'T A GOOD IDEA.

17:33.878 --> 17:35.924
WE HANGIN' LATER?OH, GOD.

17:35.967 --> 17:37.273

17:39.014 --> 17:40.711
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE A DISLOYAL BAG OF TRASH.

17:40.755 --> 17:42.496
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE TOO GOOD FOR A BAG.

17:42.539 --> 17:45.325
YOU'RE JUST A PIECE OF TRASH
LYING THERE ALL DISORGANIZED.

17:45.368 --> 17:46.587
I WANT YOU
OUT OF MY HOUSE!

17:46.630 --> 17:49.285
NOW, HERE'S
STEVIE'S LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM.

17:49.329 --> 17:51.896
THEY WERE "ALL BOROUGH" CHAMPS
THAT YEAR.

17:51.940 --> 17:54.725
OH, MY GOD, IS THAT DANNY?
HE WAS ENORMOUS.

17:54.769 --> 17:57.424
HIS MOTHER USED TO CRY
TO MAKE HIM STOP EATING,

17:57.467 --> 17:58.512
BUT HE WOULD JUST
KEEP SHOVELING IT IN.

17:58.555 --> 18:00.122
YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

18:00.166 --> 18:03.734
I'M JUST GONNA TAKE
A QUICK SNAPSHOT OF THAT.

18:03.778 --> 18:05.301
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, STEVIE?

18:05.345 --> 18:08.348
THERE'S YOUR SHOE BOX FULL
OF BASEBALL CARDS YOU GAVE ME.

18:08.391 --> 18:10.524
OR DO YOU COLLECT, LIKE,
CROQUET CARDS NOW OR SOMETHING?

18:10.567 --> 18:12.091
OKAY, YEAH, THAT'S FUNNY.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

18:12.134 --> 18:14.571
WE CAN TAKE THIS OUTSIDE
IF YOU WANT, LITTLE D.

18:14.615 --> 18:16.704
I'M NOT GONNA FIGHT A GUY
THAT SPENT THREE DAYS IN JAIL

18:16.747 --> 18:17.705
FOR STEALING UNDERWEAR!

18:17.748 --> 18:19.663

AIRPLANE!

18:38.726 --> 18:39.988
YEAH.

18:40.031 --> 18:40.771
YOU'RE NOT TOO FANCY
WHEN YOU GOT YOUR LEGS UP

18:40.815 --> 18:41.772
IN THE AIR,
ARE YOU?

18:41.816 --> 18:42.947
[groans]
COME ON.

18:42.991 --> 18:43.948
I'M GONNA KILL YOU, STEVIE!

18:43.992 --> 18:44.949
COME ON.
PUT ME DOWN!

18:44.993 --> 18:46.690

OH, GOD!

18:48.301 --> 18:50.738
OKAY, STEVIE, STEVIE.
OH, GOD.

18:50.781 --> 18:53.958
MY MA'S ST. MARIE IGNATIUS
DE LA PAZCOLLECTOR'S PLATE.

18:54.002 --> 18:55.482
IT'S THE PATRON SAINT
OF REDHEADS.

18:55.525 --> 18:56.744
I'M SORRY, STEVIE.

18:56.787 --> 18:58.615
AH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I STOLE IT ANYWAY.

18:58.659 --> 18:59.747
NO, NO, NO,
LOOK AT ME.

18:59.790 --> 19:00.922
I'M SORRY
ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

19:00.965 --> 19:02.532
WHEN YOU SHOWED UP
ALL BANGED UP,

19:02.576 --> 19:04.969
IT WAS NICE,
LIKE THE OLD DAYS.

19:05.013 --> 19:07.711
I WAS JUST NERVOUS FOR YOU
TO SEE ME IN MY NEW LIFE.

19:07.755 --> 19:09.148
WHY WERE YOU NERVOUS?

19:09.191 --> 19:10.366
I WAS PROUD OF YOU,
LITTLE D.

19:10.410 --> 19:11.715
YOU WERE?
YEAH.

19:11.759 --> 19:13.195
A GUY FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD
MAKES IT OUT OF HERE,

19:13.239 --> 19:15.937
GOES TO MANHATTAN
IN A BIG, FANCY DOCTOR'S OFFICE

19:15.980 --> 19:18.548
WITH DESKS...
WITH CHAIRS.

19:18.592 --> 19:21.203
HOW CAN HE BE SO FAT
AND SO ANGRY?

19:21.247 --> 19:22.248
IT'S ADORABLE.

19:22.291 --> 19:25.729
WELL, MY SEA SICKNESS
IS GONE.

19:25.773 --> 19:28.254
PICTURE OF A BOAT.
IT'S BACK.

19:28.297 --> 19:30.386
MM.
I CAN GET YOU SOME MILK
OF MAGNESIA.

19:30.430 --> 19:31.605

19:31.648 --> 19:33.737
I DIDN'T TAKE
MY PILLS!

19:33.781 --> 19:36.566
OH, COULD YOU HAND ME THAT?MM-HMM.

19:36.610 --> 19:38.220
WAIT A SECOND.

19:38.264 --> 19:40.004
ARE YOU TAKING
THESE ANTICOAGULANTS

19:40.048 --> 19:41.049
AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES
IN THE SAME DAY?

19:41.092 --> 19:42.224
YEAH.

19:42.268 --> 19:43.747
ARE YOU GETTING
TERRIBLE INDIGESTION?

19:43.791 --> 19:45.358
OH, TERRIBLE!

19:45.401 --> 19:47.229
I CAN BARELY GET DOWN
MY AFTERNOON HYDROX.

19:47.273 --> 19:48.404
AW, THIS IS A MESS.

I WANT YOU TO TAKE
HALF OF ONE A DAY.
OKAY.

19:57.761 --> 19:59.502
I THINK
THESE ARE NERDS.

19:59.546 --> 20:02.026
THEY'RE VERY TASTY.
THEY'RE SWEET AND SOUR.

20:02.070 --> 20:03.114
YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME
ABOUT NERDS?

20:03.158 --> 20:04.551
IT'S ONLY
MY FAVORITE FOOD.

20:04.594 --> 20:05.987
DON'T KEEP IT
IN YOUR MEDICINE.

20:06.030 --> 20:07.902
I WANT YOU TO PUT IT IN A BAG,
KEEP IT IN YOUR FREEZER.

20:07.945 --> 20:09.599
IT COULD LITERALLY KEEP
FOR FIVE YEARS.

20:09.643 --> 20:11.166
JOSE CANSECO.

20:14.256 --> 20:17.738
THESE TWO JUST SORTED OUT
MY WHOLE PILL BOX FOR ME.

20:17.781 --> 20:18.739
ARE YOU GUYS OKAY?

20:18.782 --> 20:20.654
[both]
WE'RE GOOD.

20:20.697 --> 20:22.264
AND, YOU, I BELIEVE
YOU OWE ME SOME PAYMENT

20:22.308 --> 20:23.570
IN THE FORM
OF ICE CREAM.

20:23.613 --> 20:25.006
NEAPOLITAN OR CHOCOLATE CHIP?

20:25.049 --> 20:26.399
AS LONG
AS IT'S NOT SHERBERT.

20:26.442 --> 20:27.704
YOU KNOW, STEVIE,

20:27.748 --> 20:29.402
WHY DON'T WE SIGN UP YOUR MA
FOR AN APPOINTMENT?

20:29.445 --> 20:31.099
THAT WAY, WE COULD START
TO TAKE CARE OF HER,

20:31.142 --> 20:32.492
AND STUFF LIKE THIS
WOULDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

20:32.535 --> 20:33.884
THAT'S GREAT,
AND IT'S NOT ILLEGAL.

20:33.928 --> 20:35.712
YEAH, OKAY.
MY OLDEST FRIEND,

20:35.756 --> 20:37.584
MY GIRLFRIEND
TAKING CARE OF MY MA?

20:37.627 --> 20:39.238
SOUNDS GREAT.

20:41.675 --> 20:43.633
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?I'M SORRY, WHAT--WHAT--

20:43.677 --> 20:44.678
THINK WE CAN
MAKE THIS WORK?

20:44.721 --> 20:45.722
BASEMENT'S REAL TOASTY.

20:45.766 --> 20:47.420
MA CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING
FROM UPSTAIRS.

20:47.463 --> 20:48.682
LIKE, ANYTHING.

20:48.725 --> 20:50.640
OH, GOD.
STEVIE, NO.

20:50.684 --> 20:53.077
YEAH, I GET IT.

20:53.121 --> 20:55.079
MA!
ME AND MINDY BROKE UP!

20:55.123 --> 20:57.212
I CHEATED ON HER!
WHAT?

20:57.256 --> 20:59.562
I'LL MISS THIS.

20:59.606 --> 21:00.650
HEY.

21:00.694 --> 21:01.695
PROUD OF YOU,
LITTLE D.

21:01.738 --> 21:03.697
ALL RIGHT.
SHOULD WE GO?

21:03.740 --> 21:05.002
YEAH, LITTLE D,

21:05.046 --> 21:07.701
OR SHOULD I CALL YOU
"LITTLE CHUBSTER"?

21:07.744 --> 21:08.571
OH, NO.

21:08.615 --> 21:10.356
MM-HMM, LITTLE CHUBSTER.

21:10.399 --> 21:11.705
OKAY, NO,
DON'T DO THIS.

21:11.748 --> 21:13.663
DANNY, IT BEHOOVES ME
TO TELL EVERYONE I KNOW

21:13.707 --> 21:15.317
THAT YOU WERE THE FATTEST KID
ANYONE HAS EVER SEEN.

21:15.361 --> 21:16.623
PLEASE, DON'T TELL ANYBODY.

21:16.666 --> 21:17.624
IT'S KIND OF ENDEARING.

21:17.667 --> 21:18.625
NO, IT'S NOT.

21:18.668 --> 21:19.843
BY THE WAY,
VERY COOL.

21:19.887 --> 21:21.236
YOU DATED A LOT
OF PUERTO RICAN GIRLS,

21:21.280 --> 21:22.368
WHICH I THOUGHT
WAS PRETTY PROGRESSIVE

21:22.411 --> 21:23.499
GIVEN THAT
IT WAS THE 1960s.

21:23.543 --> 21:25.066
IT WAS THE '90s!

21:25.109 --> 21:27.547
MM.

21:27.590 --> 21:29.984
[Morgan]
SHERBERT IS NOT ICE CREAM.

21:30.027 --> 21:33.596
I JUST WANT
TO MAKE THAT CLEAR.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.685
[man]
GO TO BED.
