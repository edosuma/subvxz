06:04.948 --> 06:08.743

06:08.743 --> 06:11.329
TASMANIAN TAR ROAST COFFEE.

06:11.329 --> 06:14.708
IT WAS ON SALE,
SO I BOUGHT 50 POUNDS.

06:21.673 --> 06:22.966
YUCK!

06:24.676 --> 06:28.763
HMM. MAYBE I COULD USE IT
FOR CHARCOAL LIGHTER.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.599
(HUMMING)

06:31.599 --> 06:33.143
MORNIN', SON!

06:35.603 --> 06:40.025

06:40.025 --> 06:43.486
OH, UM, DAD! UH,
I NEED TO BORROW THE VCR

06:43.486 --> 06:46.197
FOR MY SCIENCE PROJECT.
AND WHAT HAPPENED

06:46.197 --> 06:48.533
TO THE PING-PONG BALLS
I GAVE YA?

06:48.533 --> 06:52.328
UH I, I'M MAKING A SCIENCE
FICTION VIDEO INSTEAD.

06:52.328 --> 06:53.580
WELL, FORGET IT!

06:53.580 --> 06:55.707
BUT WHY, DAD? I MEAN, YOU...

06:55.707 --> 06:59.377
YOU SEE, SON, A MAN'S
HOME IS HIS CASTLE,

06:59.377 --> 07:01.713
SO THAT MAKES ME KING.

07:01.713 --> 07:04.924
KING OF THE HOUSE,
THE BOAT, THE BARBECUE,

07:04.924 --> 07:08.762
THE BOWLING TROPHIES,
AND ESPECIALLY THE VCR.

07:08.762 --> 07:11.723
SO THAT ROYAL STUFF
IS OFF-LIMITS

07:11.723 --> 07:14.142
TO PEASANTS AND SUCH
LIKE YOURSELF.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.477

07:15.477 --> 07:17.395
UH, SORTA.

07:17.395 --> 07:18.646
GOOD.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.359
PUT IT BACK.

07:27.072 --> 07:30.909
WELL, LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
JUST GONNA HAVE TO BUILD
THAT MODEL AFTER ALL.

07:30.909 --> 07:34.788
NO WAY! YOUR DAD SAID
WE COULDN'T MOVE THE VCR,

07:34.788 --> 07:38.208
BUT HE DIDN'T SAY WE
COULDN'T PLUG IN TO IT.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.250
HUH?

07:41.836 --> 07:43.088
Max: PIPE WRENCH.
PJ: CHECK!

07:52.681 --> 07:55.767
UH, YEP! PIECE OF CAKE!

07:55.767 --> 07:58.853
MOST FOLKS ARE TECHNO-WIMPS
COMPARED TO ME.

07:58.853 --> 08:01.439
NOW, ALL WE GOTTA DO
IS LOAD HER UP HERE

08:01.439 --> 08:02.941
AND START FILMING
BACK THERE.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.574
(WHISTLING)

08:17.789 --> 08:19.416
(PETE GRUNTS)

08:19.416 --> 08:23.211
HMM! SHOULDN'T HAVE BOUGHT
THAT CHEAP CEMENT.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.757
NOW WHERE AM I GONNA
FIND AN AUDIENCE?

08:28.967 --> 08:31.219
THERE'S SOMEONE, I THINK.

08:31.219 --> 08:33.263
I'LL TRY MY CHICKEN
IMPRESSION.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.068
Max: MAN, EVERY SO OFTEN,

08:47.068 --> 08:50.447
DAD ACTUALLY COMES UP
WITH A GOOD IDEA.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.323
I TOLD YOU HE LOOKED
LIKE AN ALIEN.

09:06.755 --> 09:09.341
OKAY, NOW TALK WEIRD
AND MAKE LOTS OF THREATS.

09:09.341 --> 09:10.759
READY? ACTION!

09:11.885 --> 09:13.261
ATTENTION, EARTHLINGS.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.638
WE ARE TINFOILIANS
FROM PLANET LUMINUM.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.140
UH, YEAH. LUMINUM.

09:17.140 --> 09:19.142
I REPEAT, WE ARE TINFOILIANS

09:19.142 --> 09:20.435
FROM PLANET LUMINUM.

09:20.435 --> 09:22.604
THAT IS 3 ZILLION LIGHT YEARS

09:22.604 --> 09:25.106
FROM YOUR MISERABLE
LITTLE PLANET.

09:25.106 --> 09:28.193
I AM MAXELL TDK,
AND THIS IS...

09:28.193 --> 09:30.945
PJ: UH, C-3-P-J.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.281

TO TAKE OVER EARTH!

09:35.700 --> 09:38.953
PJ: YEAH, AND SHUT DOWN
ALL YOUR SCHOOLS!

09:38.953 --> 09:40.872
THAT IS RIGHT!
WE DEMAND TO SPEAK

09:40.872 --> 09:42.499
TO YOUR LEADERS
IMMEDIATELY!

09:42.499 --> 09:44.793
UH, YES, SIR. UH,
WE'RE GETTING A SIGNAL

09:44.793 --> 09:46.419
FROM SOMEWHERE
IN OUTER SPACE SIR.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.172
A SCOUT HAS BEEN SENT
TO COMMUNICATE OUR DEMANDS.

09:49.172 --> 09:52.092
PLEASE COOPERATE
OR WE'LL DUST YA!

09:52.092 --> 09:53.635
BUT, SIR, HE'S GOT A WEAPON.

09:53.635 --> 09:55.261
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE SOME KIND

09:55.261 --> 09:58.181
OF SUB-VACUOUS PLUTONIC
EXTRICATER, SIR.

09:58.181 --> 10:00.642
(YELLING OVER PHONE)

10:00.642 --> 10:02.310
PANIC INDEED, SIR.

10:02.310 --> 10:04.854
LET'S JUST HOPE THE PUBLIC
DOESN'T SEE THIS.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.564
Max: THAT IS RIGHT,
EARTH-NOIDS.

10:06.564 --> 10:09.192
OUR SCOUT HAS
SUPER-ALIEN POWERS!

10:09.192 --> 10:11.986
HE CAN DISINTEGRATE A BUILDING
WITH THE WAVE OF HIS HAND.

10:11.986 --> 10:13.988
(GASPING)

10:13.988 --> 10:16.491
HEY, A WHOLE CROWD!

11:28.229 --> 11:29.272
AH-HYUCK!

GAMMA RAYS!

11:39.115 --> 11:40.825
OBSERVE, EARTHLINGS!

11:40.825 --> 11:43.745
C-3-P-J IS CALCULATING

12:59.487 --> 13:02.157
WHY, I WORKED HARD

13:02.157 --> 13:04.659
AND NO DROOL-DRIPPING MOON-MAN

13:04.659 --> 13:06.494
IS GONNA LAY

13:06.494 --> 13:08.705
WE'RE GONNA FIGHT BACK!

13:11.458 --> 13:13.418

SIRS, WE'VE TRACKED DOWN
THE ALIEN SIGNAL.

13:21.426 --> 13:22.802
IT'S NOT COMING FROM SPACE.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.096
IT'S BEING SENT
FROM RIGHT HERE ON EARTH!

13:25.096 --> 13:29.017
ALIENS HAVE LANDED
IN SPOONERVILLE!

13:29.017 --> 13:31.519
UH, UM, UM, PEANUT-BRITTLE,

13:31.519 --> 13:34.397
ARE YOU SURE WE SHOULDN'T
JUST LEAVE TOWN?

13:34.397 --> 13:37.609
A MAN'S HOUSE IS HIS CASTLE,
SO I'M DIGGING A MOAT.

13:37.609 --> 13:40.111
NO GALACTIC GOON
IS GONNA COME ALONG

13:40.111 --> 13:41.738
AND WRECK MY ROYAL STUFF.

13:44.115 --> 13:47.744

14:01.716 --> 14:04.469
OH, DEAR! NOW I'LL NEVER
GET THAT FREEZER DEFROSTED.

14:04.469 --> 14:06.304
LOOKS LIKE EVERYONE'S
DISAPPEARED.

14:06.304 --> 14:07.472
WAIT, WHAT'S THAT?

14:09.974 --> 14:14.270

14:16.981 --> 14:19.484
GUY'S LOST HIS MARBLES.

14:19.484 --> 14:21.277

14:58.314 --> 15:01.192
THIS IS FLYING DUCK TO HOMEBOY.
WE FOUND THE ALIEN LANDING SITE.

15:01.192 --> 15:03.278
SEND ALL UNITS.

15:03.278 --> 15:05.447
SURRENDER NOW, EARTHLINGS!

15:05.447 --> 15:07.782
RESISTANCE IS USELESS!

15:10.535 --> 15:13.204
SO IS THAT
AN A+ PROJECT OR WHAT?

15:13.204 --> 15:15.290
OH, YEAH, I LIKED THE PART

15:15.290 --> 15:16.833
ABOUT TURNING
LINCOLN'S MEMORIAL

15:40.523 --> 15:43.568
AND AUTHORITIES NOW BELIEVE
OTHER ALIENS HAVE LANDED HERE

15:43.568 --> 15:46.237
AND ARE HOLDING THIS FAMILY

WAY TO CLEAR UP THIS MESS.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.764

17:19.581 --> 17:23.126
UH, WE THOUGHT SO.

17:23.126 --> 17:26.504
QUITE SIMPLY, HE'S GOT

AHEM, UH, EXCUSE ME!

20:07.040 --> 20:08.750
I HAVE AN

20:15.382 --> 20:17.676
THERE'S ONE ON MY ROOF?

20:17.676 --> 20:20.011
ALLOW ME TO INTERPRET FOR HIM.

20:20.011 --> 20:21.930
THE MARTIAN SAYS

20:21.930 --> 20:25.183
THE WALLS OF MANKIND
ARE CLOSING IN ON HIM.

20:25.183 --> 20:30.480
SO HE'S DECIDED TO RETURN
TO THE WINDY PLAINS OF MARS.

20:30.480 --> 20:34.651
AND HE, HE'S NOT GOING TO
DESTROY EARTH AFTER ALL.

20:34.651 --> 20:37.153

21:30.081 --> 21:32.792
