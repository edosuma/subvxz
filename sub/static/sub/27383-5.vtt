00:13.628 --> 00:15.129
You know what I heard
on the radio today

00:15.162 --> 00:17.164
who I haven't heard from
in a really long time

00:17.197 --> 00:18.332
but low‐key love?

00:18.365 --> 00:19.299
Radio?

00:19.333 --> 00:20.701
Oh, so you were here
when I said that then.

00:20.735 --> 00:23.103
Which radio?
The one in the fuckin' truck.

00:23.137 --> 00:24.271
Are you being goofy right now?

00:24.304 --> 00:26.340
So, terrestrials radios!

00:26.373 --> 00:28.308
All right. Yeah. So you're
being goofy right now.

00:28.342 --> 00:29.476
No, it's just I don't knows

00:29.510 --> 00:31.546
too many peoples who still
listens to terrestrials radios.

00:31.579 --> 00:33.848

WAYNE: Stern.
Ah, Stern's fuckin' sexy.

00:45.159 --> 00:47.227
Most peoples just don't listen
to terrestrials radio.

00:47.261 --> 00:50.130
Internet radios and satellite
radios have become far superior.

00:50.164 --> 00:52.199
So, if Howard Stern's
type of radio

00:52.232 --> 00:54.535
is better
than terrestrial radio,

00:54.569 --> 00:57.471
would Howard Stern's type
be... Extra‐terrestrial?

in a really long time

01:20.394 --> 01:21.629

01:21.662 --> 01:22.830
Who was it?
DMX.

01:22.863 --> 01:24.732
Fuckin' A.
You like him, too?

01:24.765 --> 01:25.900
Sure I do.
Why?

01:25.933 --> 01:27.334
Well, because
he's an animal lover.

01:27.367 --> 01:28.903
How do youse knows
he's an animal lover?

01:28.936 --> 01:31.639
Well, on account of him always
barkin' like a dog in his songs.

01:31.672 --> 01:33.641
See, that's why
I low‐key love him.

01:33.674 --> 01:35.175
He just, he sounds so tough
when he goes

01:35.209 --> 01:37.244
"arf, arf"
at the end of a rap.

01:37.277 --> 01:38.846
How's that go, Katy?
Arf, arf.

01:38.879 --> 01:41.682
I see. So, arf, arf...

01:41.716 --> 01:43.518
What the fuck was that?
What's the problem?

01:43.551 --> 01:46.153
If DMX was here right now,
he'd hoof you right in the nuts.

01:46.186 --> 01:48.889
I think DMX would assume
Dary'd already been hoofed
in the nuts.

01:48.923 --> 01:50.825
Yeah. I mean,
you might as well
make a cat sound

01:50.858 --> 01:52.492
at the end
of a tough guy line.

01:52.527 --> 01:54.829
Well, how'd that go, Katy?
Meow!

01:54.862 --> 01:57.297
No, but put some threatening
rap music lyrics

01:57.331 --> 01:58.766

like DMX would.

02:09.243 --> 02:10.845
Nope. No animal sound

02:10.878 --> 02:12.112

as a dog barking

02:12.146 --> 02:15.382

with rap music lyrics. Not one.

was one, eh, good buddy?

09:18.105 --> 09:20.140
(SPEAKING FRENCH) Katy?

09:23.811 --> 09:26.781
But the McMurray's
are part of the lifestyle

09:26.814 --> 09:29.216
so don't they just do that
kind of shit together?

09:29.249 --> 09:31.118
I mean, they seem so in love.

09:31.151 --> 09:33.253
Different strokes for different
folks, Miss Katys.

09:33.287 --> 09:35.022
I don't think Mrs. McMurray
knows about this.

09:35.055 --> 09:36.256
It's none of our beeswax,
Miss Katy.

09:36.290 --> 09:37.658
And she oughtta.

09:37.692 --> 09:39.026
That's none of your beeswax,
Miss Katy.

09:39.059 --> 09:40.628
What are you trying
to say to me right now?

09:40.661 --> 09:41.896
I'm sorry, Miss Katys.

09:43.798 --> 09:45.365

Almost at the finish line.

09:48.703 --> 09:50.070
Let's sprint, baby,
you know I want it.

09:50.104 --> 09:51.305
Speaking of Finnish,

09:51.338 --> 09:54.241
I smashed a Finnish‐Jordanian
a few nights ago. Exquisite.

09:54.274 --> 09:57.211
I smashed a Tongan‐Micmac
just this morning.

09:57.244 --> 09:59.313
Yeah, I smashed
a Catalan‐Cameroonian.

09:59.346 --> 10:01.181
Yeah? I smashed
a Swedish‐West Indian.

10:01.215 --> 10:03.784
Good. Well I smashed
an Interior Salish‐Thai‐Syrian.

10:03.818 --> 10:07.021
Okay. Ever smashed an
East Timorese‐Papua New Guinean?

10:07.054 --> 10:10.691
No. Ever smashed
a Honduran‐Emiratis‐Metis?

10:10.725 --> 10:11.759
Talk to me when you've smashed

10:11.792 --> 10:13.661
a Cape Verdean
Bahraini Manitoban.

10:13.694 --> 10:15.963
I smashed a
Kazakh‐Baffin Island Inuit.

10:15.996 --> 10:18.198
Wonderful!
Final day of competition.

Northern Irish‐Maori tribesman.

Oh, Katy. You better tuck

before ol' Tweety Bird
comes along

11:01.909 --> 11:03.077
and makes a poopy poop on it.

11:03.110 --> 11:04.444
Glen, I will...
Katy...

11:05.412 --> 11:06.747
Get a drink.

Oh, no, no, Katy.
Yell at me today.

11:10.785 --> 11:13.754
Because today I'm playing
the role of Gail the bartender

11:13.788 --> 11:15.055
so that she may binge drink

11:15.089 --> 11:16.256
with all y'all,
which is technically

11:16.290 --> 11:18.793
a form of alcoholism.

11:18.826 --> 11:19.994
It's gonna be a great day.

11:20.027 --> 11:22.029

I think so too, buddy.

right by the short and curlies,

19:38.793 --> 19:41.495
right at the poolside bar.
And, believe me, never,

19:41.529 --> 19:44.832
ever in your life have you ever
seen so many tasties ever.

19:44.865 --> 19:46.701
I'd have a dart.
I didn't fart.

19:46.734 --> 19:48.335
Oh, now, now,
hold your horses now,

19:48.368 --> 19:50.337
'cause this is about
to get real good.

19:50.370 --> 19:54.241
Now this particular tasty
was of the Australian variety.

19:54.274 --> 19:55.309
Crikey.

19:55.342 --> 19:56.944
Now you may not know this,

19:56.977 --> 19:59.880
but down there
they likes you to piss on 'em.

19:59.914 --> 20:01.682
No, they don't.
Yes, they do.

20:01.716 --> 20:03.250
Actually, I'm told
the dudes from down under

20:03.283 --> 20:05.285
do piss on gals.

20:05.319 --> 20:06.687
But I don't know
what's in it for the gals.

20:06.721 --> 20:08.623
So anyways, she says to me,

20:09.690 --> 20:11.892
"I'm gonna go lay in the tub

20:11.926 --> 20:15.530
"and I want you come in there
and have a little piss on me."

20:15.563 --> 20:16.664
Fuck sake.

20:16.697 --> 20:20.535
So, I says to her, "You want the
yella or the big fella?"

20:20.568 --> 20:21.468
Let's have a dart.

20:21.502 --> 20:23.470
Oh, no, come on now.
Now we're almost there.

20:23.504 --> 20:25.039
I'm almost done.

20:25.072 --> 20:26.807
I don't really know what to do.

20:26.841 --> 20:29.677
I don't know if I'm supposed
to get hard

20:29.710 --> 20:32.780
or where I'm
supposed to piss on her...

20:32.813 --> 20:35.282
Dary!
I kinda wanna see where it goes.

20:35.315 --> 20:36.684
So she says to me,

20:36.717 --> 20:39.486
"I'm gonna go in there,
and lay in the tub

20:39.520 --> 20:42.690
"and you're gonna go in there
and get a little bit hard,

20:42.723 --> 20:44.424
"and you're gonna come in

20:44.458 --> 20:45.893
"and have a little piss
on my tits."

20:45.926 --> 20:48.462
Dart time!
Fart time. (LAUGHS)

20:48.495 --> 20:51.599
No, I just gotta call Anik,
make sure everything's good.

20:55.002 --> 20:56.904
McMurray...
Katy.

21:01.341 --> 21:03.744
DAN: (FARTS)
That wasn't a fart.

21:05.613 --> 21:08.448
I've got a question for you!
I've got a question for you...

21:08.482 --> 21:11.385
Okay. You need to know
that when...

21:11.418 --> 21:12.653
What are you doing

21:12.687 --> 21:14.354
the last week of May?

21:15.389 --> 21:17.758
Why?
I'll tell you.

21:19.059 --> 21:21.662
Every spring, me and about
17 gal pals

21:21.696 --> 21:24.364
head down to Cancun
for a girls' weekend.

21:25.933 --> 21:27.602
Okay...

21:27.635 --> 21:30.004
Let me tell you something
about spring break.

21:31.606 --> 21:35.009
The older cunt is there
for the young cock.

21:35.042 --> 21:37.845
And the young cock is there
for the older cunt.

21:41.816 --> 21:43.450
Oh...

21:43.483 --> 21:45.620
(INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING)

21:56.430 --> 21:58.032
Thanks, Glen.
Oh!

21:58.065 --> 21:59.133
Thanks, Bonnie.

21:59.166 --> 22:00.267
It was a pleasure, Gail.

22:00.300 --> 22:02.369
It's always nice to give you
a moment to binge drink,

22:02.402 --> 22:04.939
which is a form of alcoholism.

22:04.972 --> 22:06.006
'Kay...

22:06.040 --> 22:07.675
Come on, Glen.
I'll drive you home.

22:07.708 --> 22:08.909
Thank you, Bonnie.

22:08.943 --> 22:11.145
And I will sing you hymns
to keep you alert and inspired.

22:11.178 --> 22:13.681
No, you won't.
That's fair.

22:13.714 --> 22:14.782
Ladies first.
Okay.

22:20.154 --> 22:21.221
They look so in love.

22:21.255 --> 22:23.558
WAYNE: Got every reason
to believe they are, bud.

22:23.591 --> 22:25.492
KATY: But they...
DAN: Miss Katys?

22:25.793 --> 22:27.027
What?

22:27.061 --> 22:30.998
A wee bits earlier I suggested,
quite gently,

22:31.031 --> 22:34.001
that what the McMurray's do
is nobody's business.

22:34.034 --> 22:36.837
I remember.
I remember you shouting at me.

22:37.638 --> 22:39.173
I'm sorry, Squirrelly Dan.

22:39.206 --> 22:40.641
(WHISPERS)
That's okay, Miss Katys.

22:41.909 --> 22:45.145
We are, nones of us perfects.

22:45.179 --> 22:49.850
And that is what I
appreciates about us.

22:49.884 --> 22:51.786
Can I borrow somebody's phone
to call Anik, please?

22:51.819 --> 22:53.621
WAYNE AND KATY:
No.

22:53.654 --> 22:55.523
But what have we learned
through all this, Miss Katys?

22:55.556 --> 22:58.425
Different strokes,
for different folks. I think?

22:59.960 --> 23:01.562
