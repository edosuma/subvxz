14:55.262 --> 14:56.261
I WORK AT

YOU ALWAYS CHECK
ON YOUR STUDENTS

RUBY'S MORE THAN A STUDENT,
OKAY?

15:02.202 --> 15:04.035
I CARE ABOUT HER.

15:04.037 --> 15:06.437
WE BELIEVE RUBY'S
BEEN KIDNAPPED,

15:08.942 --> 15:10.341

15:14.481 --> 15:15.847
IT'S A GANG.

15:15.848 --> 15:17.214
THEY'RE CALLED
THE GOLDEN DRAGONS.

15:17.215 --> 15:18.581
THEY'VE BEEN SQUEEZING RUBY

15:18.585 --> 15:20.051
IS THAT WHY
SHE TAKES MARTIAL ARTS?

15:20.053 --> 15:21.553
TO PROTECT HERSELF?

15:21.554 --> 15:23.054
RUBY? NO.
SHE WANTS TO FIGHT BACK.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.055
SHE'S BEEN
GATHERING EVIDENCE -

15:24.056 --> 15:25.055
WITH ALL THE OTHER
SHOP OWNERS -

15:25.058 --> 15:26.424
AGAINST THE DRAGONS.

RATTED HER OUT.

A FEW QUESTIONS.

30:33.232 --> 30:34.531
WHY, DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
TO HIM?

30:37.136 --> 30:38.569
HE'S THREATENING

31:10.870 --> 31:11.869
IN CHINESE CULTURE,

SUICIDE CAN BE
AN HONORABLE WAY

31:13.072 --> 31:14.137

31:29.455 --> 31:30.788

TO BE ARSON.

31:32.124 --> 31:33.323

HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE

31:33.325 --> 31:35.125

RUBY SAID THAT THE DRAGONS
SET THE FIRE AS RETRIBUTION.

31:36.929 --> 31:38.262
RETRIBUTION FOR WHAT?

31:38.264 --> 31:39.263
SHE DIDN'T KNOW.

31:39.265 --> 31:40.497
SHE SAID HER FATHER
PROVOKED THEM.

31:40.499 --> 31:42.566

32:18.103 --> 32:19.169
RUBY?

32:46.632 --> 32:49.066

<i> PARKER:</i>
<i> YOUR FATHER'S</i>

THAT HE'S UPSETTING YOU.

OKAY.
SO JUST CONNECT

33:03.749 --> 33:05.015

ZHEN RECEIVED A FULL PAYOUT
FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY

33:09.121 --> 33:10.120

33:10.122 --> 33:11.254

HE USED THAT MONEY

33:11.256 --> 33:12.456
TO PAY OFF THE DRAGONS.

33:12.458 --> 33:13.690
SO JUST WHEN HE NEEDED

<i> ACCORDING TO </i>

38:34.413 --> 38:38.415
¶ I will drown ¶

38:41.019 --> 38:44.587
¶ Take your keys ¶

38:46.525 --> 38:49.759
¶ Burn this town ¶

38:53.632 --> 39:01.037
¶ There's no way now ¶

39:06.945 --> 39:08.345
¶ You knew... ¶

39:08.347 --> 39:09.946
HEY.

39:09.948 --> 39:12.048
YOU KEEP THE PEACE TODAY?

39:12.050 --> 39:13.650
YEAH, ACTUALLY.

39:13.652 --> 39:15.385
IT WAS A GOOD DAY.

39:16.121 --> 39:17.821
YEAH. I, UH...

39:18.757 --> 39:19.956
I DIDN'T GET ON THE BUS.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.958
I CAN SEE THAT.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

39:21.960 --> 39:23.927
WELL, I, UH...

39:24.863 --> 39:28.698
I JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

39:28.700 --> 39:29.933
I THOUGHT...

39:29.935 --> 39:32.602
IF IT WAS ALL RIGHT
WITH YOU,

39:33.905 --> 39:37.774
I COULD COME LIVE WITH YOU
FOR A WHILE.

39:40.011 --> 39:41.511
YOU AND YOUR MOM
NOT GETTING ALONG

39:41.513 --> 39:42.712
OR SOMETHING?

39:42.714 --> 39:44.614
NO. NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

39:45.550 --> 39:48.017
I WANNA BE HERE,
YOU KNOW, WITH YOU.

39:49.054 --> 39:50.120
DOES SHE KNOW ABOUT THIS?

39:50.122 --> 39:52.555
YEAH. I JUST...

39:52.557 --> 39:54.924
I JUST TOLD HER I WANTED
TO BRING IT UP WITH YOU FIRST.

40:03.168 --> 40:04.167
I... I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE HAPPY.

40:04.169 --> 40:05.935
I AM.

40:05.937 --> 40:07.937
I'M VERY HAPPY.

40:09.775 --> 40:10.907
LISTEN.

40:13.044 --> 40:15.044
THIS LAST YEAR,

40:15.045 --> 40:17.045
GETTING TO KNOW
EACH OTHER AGAIN,

40:17.048 --> 40:19.149
IT'S BEEN AWESOME.

40:19.151 --> 40:21.951
I'M PROUD THAT YOU GET
TO SEE WHAT I DO

40:21.953 --> 40:23.553
AND THAT YOU'VE CHANGED
YOUR MIND ABOUT ME.

40:23.555 --> 40:26.823
IT'S WHAT I'VE ALWAYS
HOPED FOR.

40:26.825 --> 40:28.825
BUT...

40:28.827 --> 40:33.997
YOU AND I JUST HAVEN'T SPENT
A WHOLE LOT OF TIME TOGETHER.

40:33.999 --> 40:36.032
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE DISAPPOINTED.

40:38.837 --> 40:40.103
I WON'T BE.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.140
SO?

40:44.142 --> 40:46.476
IS IT OKAY THEN?

40:46.478 --> 40:48.011
(HALF LAUGHS)

40:48.013 --> 40:50.580
YEAH.
YEAH, IT'S OKAY.

40:50.582 --> 40:53.082
IT'S ABSOLUTELY OKAY.

40:54.586 --> 40:58.621
¶ You can go back ¶

41:00.492 --> 41:03.126
¶ You can go back ¶
