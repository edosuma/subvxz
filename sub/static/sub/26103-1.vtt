00:58.200 --> 01:00.240
My name is Holly Evans.

01:01.480 --> 01:02.793
I'm a journalist.

01:39.592 --> 01:47.618
Synced & corrected by -robtor-

01:51.155 --> 01:53.594
Now let's take a look at
this morning's headlines.

01:53.595 --> 01:55.754
First up, the education paper.

01:55.755 --> 01:58.474
We'll be discussing the implications
of the Prime Minister's

01:58.475 --> 02:00.074
statement yesterday afternoon,

02:00.075 --> 02:03.354
and growing opposition to government
policy, with many asking what

02:03.355 --> 02:07.594
can be done to ensure that children
in state education don't suffer.

02:07.595 --> 02:11.114
The Minister for School Standards
has been bearing the brunt of

02:11.115 --> 02:15.681
criticism, over the false claims as
to the contents of the paper.

02:15.682 --> 02:17.634
The minister's speaking to us
later in the programme,

02:17.635 --> 02:20.394
and will be addressing those
claims as well as shedding

02:20.395 --> 02:23.034
light on the details of the plan
for the next five years.

02:23.035 --> 02:25.755
We're thinking around half eight,
we'll ask those questions.

02:26.955 --> 02:29.714
After the weather at nine o'clock
we we'll be joined by a scientist

02:29.715 --> 02:32.194
who will be talking to us about
the Bolivian solar eclipse and

02:32.195 --> 02:34.275
what to expect at 9.35 this evening.

02:35.715 --> 02:39.035
The last time we experienced an
eclipse of this kind was in 199...

03:04.014 --> 03:05.054
Ed Washburn.

03:05.875 --> 03:08.400
- First time?
- Er, yes, actually.

03:09.508 --> 03:10.908
Any advice?

03:13.315 --> 03:14.355
Right. OK.

03:15.355 --> 03:16.955
Thanks.

03:17.348 --> 03:18.588
That's useful.

03:32.435 --> 03:37.446
Er, Mr Kingsley?
I'm Ed Washburn from the Post.

03:37.447 --> 03:39.355
I know this must be a terrible time,
but...

03:49.275 --> 03:50.674
I've made it clear!

03:50.675 --> 03:52.074
It would be a tribute.

03:52.075 --> 03:53.411
I think you'd better go.

03:53.412 --> 03:55.994
We want to make sure your
son's story's heard.

03:55.995 --> 04:00.115
Young people look up to him
and they're shocked.

04:00.361 --> 04:03.100
Tell them about him. His... his life.

04:24.835 --> 04:28.114
Just saying! Well, that's, you
would have more customers.

04:28.115 --> 04:29.834
- Morning, Tone.
- Coffee?

04:29.835 --> 04:30.874
Sugar?

04:30.875 --> 04:32.460
Two, just in case.

04:33.595 --> 04:35.474
- Happy birthday, Holly!
- How does he know?

04:35.475 --> 04:37.314
I told him.

04:37.315 --> 04:39.074
Can you keep it to yourself?

04:39.075 --> 04:40.994
I got you something actually.

04:40.995 --> 04:42.554
You know I'm not a fan of birthdays.

04:42.555 --> 04:43.914
Yeah, but I am.

04:43.915 --> 04:45.074
Syria?

04:45.075 --> 04:46.714
- Page four.
- Carla Mason?

04:46.715 --> 04:47.760
Three.

04:47.785 --> 04:49.446
- Ah, we won't touch it.
- Aw, it's a big story.

04:49.447 --> 04:51.394
No, it's not. What are you on?

04:51.395 --> 04:54.284
MI5 whistle-blower. You?

04:54.285 --> 04:57.034
Hit and run. But there's a twist.

04:57.035 --> 04:58.994
Oh, your favourite person's
in this morning.

04:58.995 --> 05:00.751
Well, you're my favourite person.

05:00.752 --> 05:02.114
Wendy Bolt.

05:02.115 --> 05:03.154
What?!

05:03.155 --> 05:05.334
Yeah, Charlotte's trying to get the
rights to serialise her new book,

05:05.335 --> 05:07.274
thought a feature might lure her in.

05:07.275 --> 05:09.554
She's a provocative 21st-century
icon, James.

05:09.555 --> 05:11.114
She's a toxic, right wing troll.

05:11.115 --> 05:12.914
And yet despite that I'm
giving her a tour.

05:12.915 --> 05:15.314
Celebrity culture, very important.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.754
I'm a team player, me, doing my bit.

05:16.755 --> 05:18.314
Holly, you hate her even more than me.

05:18.315 --> 05:19.554
I don't hate you.

05:19.555 --> 05:22.514
No, I mean you hate her
more than I hate her.

05:22.515 --> 05:24.434
You make these mistakes when you
write as well.

05:24.435 --> 05:25.740
Clarity, James.

05:26.755 --> 05:27.994
What time's she getting here?

05:27.995 --> 05:29.074
I don't know.

05:29.075 --> 05:32.274
Holly! This is Wendy.

05:32.275 --> 05:33.994
Holly's our deputy news editor.

05:33.995 --> 05:36.321
Deputy news editor? Sounds important.

05:36.322 --> 05:37.547
See you later.

05:37.548 --> 05:38.714
Something I can print.

05:38.715 --> 05:40.634
Thanks for doing this.
You give the best tours.

05:40.635 --> 05:43.260
- I'm the only one who volunteers.
- Also true.

05:44.035 --> 05:47.500
Right, then, shall we?

05:50.475 --> 05:52.954
Shall I find someone less busy?

05:52.955 --> 05:54.340
You'd struggle.

05:56.515 --> 05:58.794
- Who's this?
- Andrea Reed.

05:58.795 --> 06:00.874
She was walking back to the Tube
after a night out.

06:00.875 --> 06:04.154
She was hit and killed by a car
that didn't stop.

06:04.155 --> 06:06.380
- We think there's a story.
- Why?

06:07.235 --> 06:08.874
It was a police car.

06:08.875 --> 06:10.594
So, the tour.

06:10.595 --> 06:13.474
The Herald started in 1936
as the Yorkshire Herald,

06:13.475 --> 06:16.474
- and it continues a tradition of...
- I've read the Wikipedia page.

06:16.475 --> 06:18.434
I know the Herald,
you think you're a prize-winning,

06:18.435 --> 06:21.114
crusading, liberal lefty paper,
exposing hypocrisy and corruption.

06:21.115 --> 06:23.194
Well, we try to do the right thing,
if that's what you mean.

06:23.195 --> 06:24.782
- I prefer the Post.
- Yeah you would.

06:24.783 --> 06:26.874
The Post is sexist, sensationalist,
and doesn't check its facts.

06:26.875 --> 06:29.194
I know. But it's a lot more fun.

06:29.195 --> 06:31.172
2-1. Clearly a penalty.

06:31.173 --> 06:34.231
Ah, but not awarded. Let that be a
lesson, Clive. Life's not fair.

06:34.232 --> 06:36.034
I could teach you a lesson,
take away that pass.

06:36.035 --> 06:37.594
Oh yeah? I'll kick you in the balls.

06:37.595 --> 06:39.154
I'll call my guys.

06:39.155 --> 06:40.594
You haven't got guys.

06:40.595 --> 06:42.714
I've got seven guys.

06:42.715 --> 06:44.314
Definitely a penalty.

06:44.315 --> 06:45.620
That's right.

06:47.795 --> 06:49.074
How was New York?

06:49.075 --> 06:50.940
Extremely cold.

06:51.355 --> 06:52.674
I like your wife's new hair.

06:52.675 --> 06:54.914
- What?
- It's on Facebook.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.554
What, her hair's on Facebook?

06:56.555 --> 06:58.395
The pictures she put up.

06:58.922 --> 07:00.541
I, I don't know what
you're talking about.

07:00.542 --> 07:02.554
She got it done when you were away.

07:02.555 --> 07:04.634
Duncan, it's a different colour.

07:04.635 --> 07:07.155
Tell me you said something nice?

07:08.275 --> 07:10.680
- Wow.
- Doors closing.

07:11.115 --> 07:14.274
Yeah, no, he absolutely respects
your position in Parliament.

07:14.275 --> 07:15.940
Oh, he's just here.

07:16.595 --> 07:19.514
- Carla Mason.
- Oh, yeah, that's fine.

07:19.515 --> 07:23.300
Carla! Oh, dear.

07:23.715 --> 07:26.394
Mmm, I, I know. I know, I can imagine.

07:26.395 --> 07:27.714
What do you want us to do?

07:27.715 --> 07:29.794
Cos there's no doubt
it's in the public interest.

07:29.795 --> 07:32.474
She's got a speech on feminism
tomorrow to the Oxford Union.

07:32.475 --> 07:35.554
Raz tells me that you've got a
speech on feminism tomorrow.

07:35.555 --> 07:38.314
Are you, er, going ahead with that?

07:38.315 --> 07:39.715
Mm.

07:40.398 --> 07:42.740
Yeah, that does sound important.

07:43.115 --> 07:46.220
Yeah, I know, bad timing, indeed.

07:46.395 --> 07:47.754
Hmm.

07:47.755 --> 07:49.780
What's Raz suggesting?

07:53.420 --> 07:55.314
Well, sounds good.

07:55.315 --> 07:56.354
Come to us.

07:56.355 --> 07:59.537
We've got a new office we like to
show off, and cos our

07:59.538 --> 08:03.034
proprietor's got a thing for design
we've got these incredible seats.

08:03.035 --> 08:04.794
It's like musical chairs here,

08:04.795 --> 08:07.755
everyone's trying to sit down
all the time.

08:08.228 --> 08:09.268
Two hours?

08:10.035 --> 08:12.035
OK, and we'll have a chat. OK, bye.

08:14.167 --> 08:15.647
All right, let's have a look.

08:19.721 --> 08:22.300
Carla, Carla, Carla.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.314
Well, how can we not use this?

08:28.315 --> 08:30.434
It's deliberate sexist,
antifeminist shaming.

08:30.435 --> 08:32.833
It's only surfaced now
for political gain.

08:32.835 --> 08:34.034
We shouldn't go near it.

08:34.034 --> 08:36.394
It's a very human side to the politician.

08:36.395 --> 08:39.001
- It's 30 years old.
- That doesn't matter.

08:39.025 --> 08:40.418
Yeah, it makes it irrelevant, Peter.

08:40.419 --> 08:42.418
Holly feels very strongly about it.

08:42.419 --> 08:44.018
What was the occasion?

08:44.019 --> 08:45.578
A birthday, we think, early '90s.

08:45.579 --> 08:47.538
This was taken on camera with film.

08:47.539 --> 08:49.178
- Remember those?
- Right, what's next?

08:49.179 --> 08:52.138
- Er, solar eclipse in Bolivia.
- Do some pictures. Yep.

08:52.139 --> 08:54.059
Shawn Kingsley.

08:54.580 --> 08:56.098
Still a lot of
questions about what it means.

08:56.099 --> 08:59.018
There's issues we can bring out, but
obviously we've got to be sensitive.

08:59.019 --> 09:02.418
His body was found hanging in a stairwell
by his cleaner in the morning.

09:02.419 --> 09:04.138
Must've been a nasty surprise for her.

09:04.139 --> 09:05.298
There were pills, drink.

09:05.299 --> 09:08.268
On his laptop was homosexual
pornography along with e-mails

09:08.269 --> 09:09.618
threatening to out him.

09:09.619 --> 09:11.274
We've got an interview with his parents.

09:11.299 --> 09:13.098
- Have we?
- Yeah.

09:13.099 --> 09:16.898
Er, er, yeah, but there,
there is a problem.

09:16.899 --> 09:18.698
I promised them it would be a
tribute feature.

09:18.699 --> 09:20.677
- Sorry, who are you?
- Ed Washburn.

09:20.678 --> 09:22.018
I started last week.

09:22.019 --> 09:23.578
Jay's off sick.

09:23.579 --> 09:25.178
First death knock?

09:25.179 --> 09:26.940
- Yeah.
- And you got in.

09:27.779 --> 09:29.938
- Very good.
- Yeah, but...

09:29.939 --> 09:31.139
What's the problem?

09:32.543 --> 09:34.040
- Er, well...
- Can he speak?

09:35.659 --> 09:37.138
I didn't know he was gay.

09:37.139 --> 09:38.658
I don't think they did either.

09:38.659 --> 09:40.698
Didn't you ask them why they
thought he'd done it?

09:40.699 --> 09:42.818
Yeah, they, they, they
just thought he was unhappy.

09:42.819 --> 09:45.298
Go back and tell them, then.
If they don't know, tell them.

09:45.299 --> 09:46.578
Go back?

09:46.579 --> 09:48.018
Yeah, get their response.

09:48.019 --> 09:49.138
Is...

09:49.139 --> 09:52.133
Sorry, is that our job?
To tell them about their son?

09:52.134 --> 09:53.421
Surely the police have got
someone that could...

09:53.446 --> 09:54.818
Our job is to deliver

09:54.819 --> 09:58.538
the news, so yeah, yes,
very much in our remit.

09:58.539 --> 10:00.899
Get that, we're good. Go.

10:05.139 --> 10:07.018
Kingsley could play.

10:07.019 --> 10:08.618
He could.

10:08.619 --> 10:10.300
Why don't they just come out?

10:15.539 --> 10:16.978
Andrea Reed?

10:16.979 --> 10:19.538
Oh, they say it was a tragic
accident, but there were no police

10:19.539 --> 10:21.779
in the area, so the witness
must be wrong.

10:22.100 --> 10:23.818
I'm finding that hard to believe.

10:23.819 --> 10:25.258
Keep digging.

10:25.259 --> 10:26.818
- You mean...
- I mean ask around.

10:26.819 --> 10:28.980
Find something more. We need some proof.

10:29.539 --> 10:31.058
Right, I'll keep...

10:31.059 --> 10:32.960
Keep trying. Exactly.

10:33.859 --> 10:35.298
Have you seen James?

10:35.299 --> 10:37.338
Er, he's meeting someone for a story.

10:37.339 --> 10:39.378
- What story?
- I don't know, why?

10:39.379 --> 10:40.978
I had a nervous call from MI5,

10:40.979 --> 10:42.698
reminding us of the Official Secrets Act.

10:42.699 --> 10:45.339
- Can you check what he's up to?
- Yeah, sure, no problem.

10:47.538 --> 10:48.578
Are you OK?

10:49.539 --> 10:51.139
Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

10:51.918 --> 10:53.118
Nothing.

11:22.279 --> 11:23.599
Tom Pryor?

11:25.139 --> 11:26.858
Where's your car?

11:26.859 --> 11:28.658
I don't have a car.

11:28.659 --> 11:30.658
Then why are we meeting in a car park?

11:30.659 --> 11:31.698
You suggested it.

11:31.699 --> 11:34.660
Yeah, so we could stay in our cars
and we wouldn't be seen!

11:36.658 --> 11:38.018
Get in.

11:44.579 --> 11:46.098
Did you bring your phone?

11:46.099 --> 11:48.378
- You said not to.
- Good.

11:48.379 --> 11:49.979
That's good.

11:51.819 --> 11:53.980
So, you work for MI5?

11:55.659 --> 11:56.740
Yep.

11:57.532 --> 11:59.280
As what?

11:59.958 --> 12:00.998
I can't tell you.

12:02.618 --> 12:03.938
OK.

12:04.631 --> 12:05.572
Well...

12:05.597 --> 12:07.218
Well, I've signed the
Official secrets Act, OK,

12:07.219 --> 12:08.978
but I also have a conscience.

12:08.979 --> 12:11.698
But I don't want to go to prison
or leave the country.

12:11.699 --> 12:13.419
Well, what can you tell me?

12:16.292 --> 12:17.692
Resonance.

12:19.300 --> 12:20.378
Resonance?

12:20.379 --> 12:22.658
- That's the name of the project.
- OK.

12:22.659 --> 12:23.902
What does it do?

12:30.419 --> 12:31.699
I can't tell you.

12:33.765 --> 12:35.125
Right, Tom, look...

12:36.419 --> 12:38.898
The name's enough, all right?
You just, you just follow that up.

12:38.899 --> 12:40.818
That's hard if it's literally
just a code name.

12:40.819 --> 12:43.018
I mean, I don't even know if you
really work for MI5.

12:43.019 --> 12:46.220
- I don't know anything.
- I've told you everything that I can.

12:47.659 --> 12:48.738
What?

12:48.739 --> 12:52.578
Look, I am one of only three
investigative reporters

12:52.579 --> 12:53.818
left at my paper.

12:53.819 --> 12:56.138
I'm under huge pressure to write
stories that have substance

12:56.139 --> 12:57.578
and evidence.

12:57.579 --> 12:59.898
I don't know who you are.
I don't know what you do.

12:59.899 --> 13:03.698
All you're giving me is a name,
and a suggestion of a programme.

13:03.699 --> 13:05.458
I thought you were into all this.

13:05.459 --> 13:07.178
I looked you up.

13:07.179 --> 13:08.618
I thought this was your thing, you know.

13:08.619 --> 13:10.258
Take a hint and run with it.

13:10.259 --> 13:11.778
Not these days.

13:11.779 --> 13:13.259
Need more than a hint.

13:15.699 --> 13:20.700
Look, get me some proof
and we can talk again.

13:23.152 --> 13:24.192
I can't.

13:28.819 --> 13:29.939
Right...

13:41.179 --> 13:43.219
I'm just supposed to sit here?

13:44.779 --> 13:47.258
Mrs Mason, sorry I'm late.

13:47.259 --> 13:48.740
How do you do?

13:49.819 --> 13:53.898
Now, this picture, I don't know why
you're ashamed of it, it's...

13:53.899 --> 13:55.747
I'm the most prominent
woman in the Cabinet

13:55.772 --> 13:57.258
and it doesn't fit with my message.

13:57.259 --> 13:59.626
That little girls shouldn't
want to be models,

13:59.651 --> 14:01.338
they should want to be engineers?

14:01.339 --> 14:05.228
Duncan, this government is trying to
do things,

14:05.229 --> 14:07.538
achieve things that you approve of,

14:07.539 --> 14:11.058
under political circumstances that
make it very difficult,

14:11.059 --> 14:12.298
and all I'm asking...

14:12.299 --> 14:15.218
The National Gallery has images of
woman with their clothes off.

14:15.219 --> 14:17.300
No-one seems to be bothered about that.

14:17.325 --> 14:18.378
That's completely different.

14:18.379 --> 14:20.618
How? They're pictures,
people look at them.

14:20.619 --> 14:21.978
It's the way they look at them.

14:21.979 --> 14:27.098
Oh, but you can't legislate for
what goes on in my head.

14:27.099 --> 14:32.058
If I go to a gallery and I get a
semi staring at a picture there...

14:32.059 --> 14:33.818
Not an image I wanted.

14:33.819 --> 14:37.578
Or if I'm looking at one of the
photos on our centre pages...

14:37.579 --> 14:41.498
If I'm looking at Abi, off of
Love Island relaxing on a beach,

14:41.499 --> 14:46.298
and instead of getting a hard-on I
find myself contemplating abstractly

14:46.299 --> 14:49.058
the aesthetics of the female form,
there's nothing you can do.

14:49.059 --> 14:53.499
- Objectification and exploitation...
- We can't ignore this, Carla.

14:55.025 --> 14:56.065
I know.

14:56.939 --> 14:59.379
But you don't want the story
on the front page.

14:59.625 --> 15:00.900
Ideally not.

15:05.698 --> 15:08.500
Shawn Kingsley's been found dead.

15:09.019 --> 15:11.020
It turns out he was gay.

15:11.419 --> 15:12.979
We might go with that.

15:14.259 --> 15:15.658
That's your decision.

15:15.659 --> 15:18.660
But if we splashed on you,
we'd sell more papers.

15:19.179 --> 15:23.500
An interview as we agreed,
and it stays off the front.

15:27.499 --> 15:28.978
Deal.

15:28.979 --> 15:31.258
- Kelly!
- Yep?

15:31.259 --> 15:33.818
Kelly is our deputy news editor.

15:33.819 --> 15:36.258
- She'll be looking after you.
- Mrs Mason, pleased to meet you.

15:36.259 --> 15:37.658
Pleasure to meet you.

15:37.659 --> 15:41.017
We're going to need you to explain
the context of the photo,

15:41.018 --> 15:43.778
and the effect that it's had on your
family.

15:43.779 --> 15:45.498
- I want this to be really personal.
- Sure.

15:45.499 --> 15:48.659
Er, and... Oh, we need a photo.
So if you follow me.

15:52.499 --> 15:55.058
Excuse me, hello. Abi.
Abi, you all right?

15:55.059 --> 15:56.658
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:56.659 --> 16:01.658
This is Carla Mason. Long service as
an MP, married, very principled.

16:01.659 --> 16:04.578
She's Secretary of State
for Work and Pensions,

16:04.579 --> 16:08.058
and since this government sneaked
into office she's also become

16:08.059 --> 16:10.298
their de facto spokesperson on women.

16:10.299 --> 16:11.458
Duncan...

16:11.459 --> 16:15.258
So we just thought that, since you
were a party girl as a student,

16:15.259 --> 16:16.939
that you might pose with Abi.

16:19.219 --> 16:21.778
- Do you recognise her?
- I'm afraid I don't.

16:21.779 --> 16:25.458
Really? You were on what? Erm...

16:25.459 --> 16:29.178
One series of Love Island and...

16:29.179 --> 16:31.578
- ..Big Brother.
- Celebrity Big Brother.

16:31.579 --> 16:33.818
Celebrity Big Brother!

16:33.819 --> 16:37.738
And, before that, she was at
Warwick. Right? Same as you.

16:37.739 --> 16:39.378
English and Philosophy.

16:39.379 --> 16:41.778
Carla disapproves of your body.

16:41.779 --> 16:43.098
I'm not doing this.

16:43.099 --> 16:46.938
Oh, come on. This is just about
encouraging young people to

16:46.939 --> 16:49.538
have fun, but at the same time take
care of themselves.

16:49.539 --> 16:52.178
You know, safe sex, health checks,
breast exams.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.698
It's a good cause.

16:53.699 --> 16:55.298
Check me out.

16:55.299 --> 16:57.578
Yeah, right. Check me out.

16:57.579 --> 16:59.720
It's having a big impact on campus,

16:59.745 --> 17:01.058
and we just want you to
endorse the campaign.

17:01.059 --> 17:03.738
- You don't have to wear the T-shirt.
- I wasn't intending to.

17:03.739 --> 17:05.280
You could just hold one up instead.

17:05.305 --> 17:08.137
I can't walk out in front of the
Oxford Union, to speak about

17:08.138 --> 17:12.458
women's rights, about rape culture
on campuses, having just

17:12.459 --> 17:16.099
posed next to a young lady wearing a
T-shirt saying "check me out".

17:19.098 --> 17:23.298
Hmm. Well, the Oxford Union should
be a bit more open-minded.

17:23.299 --> 17:24.539
Come on, what do you think?

17:28.979 --> 17:31.540
I mean... splish splash.

17:42.019 --> 17:43.818
Right, Abi, don't go home yet.

17:43.819 --> 17:45.899
- No problem.
- All right, thanks.

17:51.059 --> 17:52.658
How'd it go?

17:52.659 --> 17:53.858
Not great.

17:53.859 --> 17:56.458
Apparently MI5 called the paper
first thing this morning,

17:56.459 --> 17:59.538
to remind us of our national
security commitments.

17:59.539 --> 18:01.698
But best not get your hopes up.
Just find something...

18:01.699 --> 18:03.225
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Something you can print.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.658
Oh, did you like your present?

18:04.659 --> 18:06.419
- I've not opened it yet.
- You should.

18:33.579 --> 18:34.979
Let's go where it happened.

18:35.952 --> 18:36.859
You mean the...

18:36.884 --> 18:38.938
I mean Andrea Reed. Let's
see what we can find.

18:38.939 --> 18:41.618
- The accident.
- But aren't you needed where?

18:41.619 --> 18:43.418
Yeah, you can get stuck behind a desk.

18:43.419 --> 18:46.740
I've got 40 minutes for lunch so
book a taxi about one o'clock, OK?

18:47.699 --> 18:48.900
No problem!

18:54.219 --> 18:59.218
I had reporters on my doorstep for
five days after she died.

18:59.219 --> 19:01.138
I don't mean in the street.

19:01.139 --> 19:05.418
I'm talking on the balcony that
leads up to my door.

19:05.419 --> 19:10.578
I called the papers, and they said
they would put me up in a hotel,

19:10.579 --> 19:14.460
protect me, but only IF I told my story.

19:15.259 --> 19:17.178
My daughter had been killed.

19:17.179 --> 19:18.460
That was hell.

19:19.259 --> 19:22.338
But the newspapers were the ones
making the flames hot.

19:22.339 --> 19:24.338
That was 20 years ago.

19:24.339 --> 19:26.418
It's no different now.

19:26.419 --> 19:31.138
It's time to make sure that no-one
else has to go through what I did.

19:31.139 --> 19:34.100
It's time for statutory regulation.

19:35.219 --> 19:37.220
Thank you, Mrs Ashton.

19:38.099 --> 19:40.578
- Who would like to start?
- Duncan Allen, Editor of the Post.

19:40.579 --> 19:41.698
Yeah, I know.

19:41.699 --> 19:44.938
Mrs Ashton, you are a remarkably
able speaker.

19:44.939 --> 19:46.698
Been campaigning for a while now.

19:46.699 --> 19:48.898
Of course, yeah, I didn't mean that
to be patronising.

19:48.899 --> 19:50.860
Then you should be more careful.

19:51.899 --> 19:56.378
Do you not feel that there was some
public interest

19:56.379 --> 19:58.578
in your daughter's death?
In the way it happened.

19:58.579 --> 20:01.258
- We're talking hours after it happened.
- Hours after it happened

20:01.259 --> 20:02.498
is why it's news.

20:02.499 --> 20:06.138
Didn't you want to see outrage at
your daughter's murder?

20:06.139 --> 20:07.416
I would've rather had justice.

20:07.441 --> 20:09.458
And do you feel that
you've been denied that?

20:09.459 --> 20:12.218
Cos I wrote a lot about your case
back then, and I agree you

20:12.219 --> 20:14.818
Were let down, Mrs Ashton, but not by us.

20:14.819 --> 20:17.378
By the police. Your community.

20:17.379 --> 20:19.343
By the friends of your daughter

20:19.368 --> 20:20.738
who were with her that night
that didn't come forward.

20:20.739 --> 20:22.480
Just because there were
failings elsewhere...

20:22.505 --> 20:23.658
Go back over those stories.

20:23.659 --> 20:25.331
Duncan, you're not supposed
to be cross-examining...

20:25.356 --> 20:26.778
I'm not. Read the stories.

20:26.779 --> 20:28.151
There were common sentiments...

20:28.176 --> 20:29.898
- You've made your point.
- Compassion.

20:29.899 --> 20:33.938
Outrage. A desire to know what happened.

20:33.939 --> 20:36.258
Right? Things the police were sorely
lacking in.

20:36.259 --> 20:38.460
Someone went through her locker.

20:39.499 --> 20:43.018
A reporter from the Post broke into
Letty's school at night,

20:43.019 --> 20:45.178
found her locker before anyone else
had thought of it,

20:45.179 --> 20:47.538
before the police, and went through it.

20:47.539 --> 20:50.858
That's the only way they could've
known about her friends,

20:50.859 --> 20:53.580
her boyfriend, her drawing.

20:56.099 --> 20:57.418
Yeah.

20:57.419 --> 20:58.659
Yeah.

21:00.780 --> 21:02.818
Do you want the truth?

21:02.819 --> 21:06.220
Full transparency, until it's about you.

21:09.179 --> 21:10.540
That's right.

21:11.939 --> 21:13.539
It's a contradiction.

21:15.619 --> 21:18.140
Why give her such a hard time?

21:18.619 --> 21:21.861
Look, we've all heard that speech
before. She's been in front of

21:21.862 --> 21:24.578
committees and press conferences for
years now, she's used to it.

21:24.579 --> 21:26.040
Can you imagine if something like that

21:26.065 --> 21:27.298
- happened to Fred?
- I know.

21:27.299 --> 21:29.778
That's why she's got my respect.

21:29.779 --> 21:35.698
In spite of all that she's been
through, she's somehow stayed good.

21:35.699 --> 21:39.338
She still believes in righteousness.

21:39.339 --> 21:41.020
Justice.

21:41.619 --> 21:43.698
And she basically told me to
fuck off, which is good.

21:43.699 --> 21:46.418
- I like women who tell me to do that.
- I've met your wife.

21:46.419 --> 21:49.778
Yeah, well...
Actually, these days she doesn't.

21:49.779 --> 21:51.978
I forgot to tell her that I wasn't
coming home,

21:51.979 --> 21:53.139
and she just kind of...

21:55.272 --> 21:56.312
...took it.

21:58.299 --> 22:00.459
- It's not a good sign.
- Hm.

22:04.059 --> 22:07.898
Were you on her balcony? One of
those reporters she talked about?

22:07.899 --> 22:10.738
Actually, no. No, I had standards.

22:10.739 --> 22:14.578
Standards? Strange to think you were
once a journalist.

22:14.579 --> 22:15.898
I'm still a journalist!

22:15.899 --> 22:17.300
Really?

22:18.179 --> 22:19.459
I hadn't noticed.

22:34.539 --> 22:36.019
Holly!

22:41.779 --> 22:44.800
- Holly, er...
- This is where the car hit her?

22:45.419 --> 22:48.178
Oh, I think so. This is where they
found her.

22:48.179 --> 22:51.338
But I spoke with the woman in the
shop, and...

22:51.339 --> 22:53.780
You realise you could die right now?

22:55.299 --> 22:57.840
- Sorry?
- Any moment, one of these drivers.

22:57.865 --> 22:59.498
Their hand could slip.

22:59.499 --> 23:02.100
They could come off the road and
suddenly you're dead.

23:03.019 --> 23:05.738
Or you could trip and fall the wrong way.

23:05.739 --> 23:09.058
Um right, um... Holly, the shop has
a camera, you can see the street.

23:09.059 --> 23:11.500
But they don't have the footage any more.

23:12.299 --> 23:15.378
Apparently a reporter from the Post
came in over the weekend and er,

23:15.379 --> 23:19.218
they took the CCTV footage away
from outside the shop.

23:19.219 --> 23:22.578
They took it away? Then we need to
get it.

23:22.579 --> 23:23.619
The footage.

23:25.059 --> 23:27.338
They're not going to give it away.
How am I supposed to...?

23:27.339 --> 23:28.699
The Post won't help us!

23:29.939 --> 23:31.258
Maybe I can try the flats next?

23:31.259 --> 23:33.538
Or, erm, put a request out on social
media.

23:33.539 --> 23:36.074
There's a few local groups
which might be...

23:36.074 --> 23:38.074
_

23:44.819 --> 23:46.738
I'd gone for a lie down,

23:46.739 --> 23:48.980
and I woke up...

23:49.739 --> 23:51.019
There he was.

23:53.019 --> 23:54.740
Do you know what he told me?

23:55.219 --> 23:56.298
You mean...?

23:56.299 --> 23:57.698
It was a dream.

23:57.699 --> 23:59.698
"It's for the best."

23:59.699 --> 24:02.900
I said, "How can it be?"

24:03.899 --> 24:05.539
And he said,

24:06.172 --> 24:07.532
"Have faith.

24:08.565 --> 24:09.940
"Wait and see."

24:11.099 --> 24:12.940
He believed in God.

24:14.592 --> 24:15.632
Right.

24:17.045 --> 24:18.085
Do you?

24:21.539 --> 24:23.138
What did you want to tell us?

24:23.139 --> 24:26.180
Did the police talk to you about
what they found?

24:27.699 --> 24:32.098
Shawn took his own life, and I just
wanted to make sure you were

24:32.099 --> 24:35.418
aware of what they believe
to be the reason.

24:35.419 --> 24:39.418
He'd always suffered with
depression, since he was a teenager.

24:39.419 --> 24:42.178
The police said an ex had pictures
of him.

24:42.179 --> 24:44.498
- She was going to put them out there.
- Did they...

24:44.499 --> 24:47.658
Did they say it was a girl? The ex?

24:47.659 --> 24:49.420
Is that what they said?

24:50.099 --> 24:52.780
I think there's been some
miscommunication, because...

24:53.459 --> 24:57.738
...it wasn't... a girl...

24:57.739 --> 24:59.819
...who was blackmailing him.

25:06.199 --> 25:07.319
Shawn was gay.

25:08.819 --> 25:11.458
That's what's going to emerge
over the next few hours,

25:11.459 --> 25:13.458
and the fact that was hidden
suggests it may have been a

25:13.459 --> 25:16.298
contributing factor to him
taking his own life. But...

25:16.299 --> 25:19.499
I was concerned you weren't aware
of that during our interview.

25:21.579 --> 25:24.643
- Gay?
- This is going to be all over the news

25:24.668 --> 25:26.138
very soon,

25:26.139 --> 25:28.100
and I wanted to make sure you knew.

25:47.793 --> 25:49.793
_

25:58.459 --> 25:59.860
We...

26:00.859 --> 26:03.698
We think we'd rather not do
the interview, actually.

26:03.699 --> 26:06.498
- You...
- Cancel the whole thing.

26:06.499 --> 26:09.818
It's going to be a shock for his
fans as well.

26:09.819 --> 26:13.138
There may be young men out there who
are in Shawn's position,

26:13.139 --> 26:15.378
and they would benefit from hearing
from you.

26:15.379 --> 26:18.818
Like you said, why didn't he come to
you and talk about it?

26:18.819 --> 26:20.418
It's bullshit.

26:20.419 --> 26:22.220
You just want your story.

26:43.419 --> 26:44.699
The thing is...

26:46.259 --> 26:49.299
I'm sorry, but we have actually
already done the interview.

26:50.859 --> 26:54.138
If you don't do another I'll have to
write up the story as about

26:54.139 --> 26:56.379
how his parents didn't have a clue
who he was.

27:01.019 --> 27:02.860
We didn't know our own son?

27:07.185 --> 27:08.305
It's up to you.

27:09.739 --> 27:13.580
If you want to have another go,
and talk some more.

27:23.819 --> 27:24.979
Get out.

27:26.179 --> 27:27.419
Get out!

27:40.739 --> 27:43.018
She returns! I'm told you went on a
mission.

27:43.019 --> 27:44.059
How did it go?

27:45.619 --> 27:47.018
Clearly not well.

27:47.019 --> 27:48.658
How was your interview?

27:48.659 --> 27:50.898
They wanted to know about my curtains.

27:50.899 --> 27:52.458
My hairstyle.

27:52.459 --> 27:56.618
Nothing on politics, society,
our obsession with celebrity,

27:56.619 --> 27:58.138
welfare, the NHS.

27:58.139 --> 28:00.378
From what I understand, it's not
that sort of article.

28:00.379 --> 28:03.378
You don't actually write the
stories, do you?

28:03.379 --> 28:05.738
I used to, but I'm a news editor
now, so...

28:05.739 --> 28:08.778
So you don't normally go out in person.

28:08.779 --> 28:10.607
- No.
- And yet, you're also not

28:10.632 --> 28:11.738
fully in charge.

28:11.739 --> 28:14.258
You're in a kind of hinterland
between where the work happens

28:14.259 --> 28:17.178
and management. You're exactly where
one finds the dead wood!

28:17.179 --> 28:19.618
Well, that's strange, cos I'm busy
from the moment I wake up.

28:19.619 --> 28:22.500
Yet the paper's still riddled
with mistakes.

28:23.059 --> 28:25.058
Is this really what you wanted to do?

28:25.059 --> 28:26.978
- What?
- An office job, essentially.

28:26.979 --> 28:28.298
Admin.

28:28.299 --> 28:32.218
Wendy, I hope you won't be offended
if I completely ignore you.

28:32.219 --> 28:35.058
You know, you're very clever, but
you don't really look people

28:35.059 --> 28:36.778
in the eye all that much.

28:36.779 --> 28:39.538
Do you have a thriving personal life
outside all of this?

28:39.539 --> 28:42.938
- I'm busy, so...
- Busy with work, but not much else.

28:42.939 --> 28:45.298
You get 100 e-mails a day, but none
of them inviting you out

28:45.299 --> 28:47.658
for a drink. I've met women like you,

28:47.659 --> 28:50.898
using work to cover a sort of
dissatisfaction with their lives.

28:50.899 --> 28:52.698
Fail to find a man,
fail to have children,

28:52.723 --> 28:54.538
fail to even have a
close group of friends.

28:54.539 --> 28:57.160
Work's your one and only thing,
and even at that you're failing,

28:57.185 --> 28:58.683
though you probably
haven't realised yet...

29:07.419 --> 29:08.700
Well...

29:09.499 --> 29:11.019
I'd call that a confirmation.

29:12.619 --> 29:15.658
Wendy, would you like to come with me?

29:15.659 --> 29:16.699
Sure.

29:22.819 --> 29:25.378
Mrs Mason! If you'd just wait here!

29:25.379 --> 29:27.418
I can find Amina for you!

29:27.419 --> 29:29.540
She's not in her office, Mrs Mason!

29:41.779 --> 29:43.540
Carla.

29:44.219 --> 29:46.698
- The photo's on your website.
- No, it's not.

29:46.699 --> 29:49.938
The first paragraph of the article,
you link right to it.

29:49.939 --> 29:51.258
A link, precisely.

29:51.259 --> 29:52.618
Same difference.

29:52.619 --> 29:55.818
Amina, I've just been at the Post
basically begging Duncan Allen

29:55.819 --> 29:57.298
not to put it on the front page.

29:57.299 --> 29:58.664
Did he offer you a deal?

29:58.689 --> 30:00.136
- I'm not taking it.
- Good.

30:00.137 --> 30:02.258
But whatever he does is irrelevant
when you've got it front

30:02.259 --> 30:03.858
and centre yourself.

30:03.859 --> 30:07.178
So hypocritical.
I'm trying to make a difference

30:07.179 --> 30:10.434
and I can't help it if there are
pictures from decades ago.

30:10.435 --> 30:12.018
It's being widely discussed.

30:12.019 --> 30:14.138
"It's already on the internet,"
is no defence.

30:14.139 --> 30:16.618
So are beheadings, hard-core pornography.

30:16.619 --> 30:19.298
You're supposed to be better
than the internet,

30:19.299 --> 30:20.658
that's the point of you.

30:20.659 --> 30:24.138
Carla, we have known
each other a long time,

30:24.139 --> 30:27.418
and you have a tendency
to over-react, OK?

30:27.419 --> 30:30.778
So take a seat, and some water,

30:30.779 --> 30:32.699
do some breathing exercises.

30:33.779 --> 30:36.978
Yes, the link is currently
prominent on our website,

30:36.979 --> 30:38.538
but in an hour it won't be.

30:38.539 --> 30:40.058
And I'm sorry for your ego

30:40.059 --> 30:42.218
but it won't be prominent
in the paper tomorrow.

30:42.219 --> 30:45.802
We are going to cover it as a
feature about misogyny on page four

30:45.803 --> 30:47.299
and that's your lot.

30:51.420 --> 30:53.899
I've got a speech tomorrow.

30:54.178 --> 30:55.538
To the Oxford Union.

30:57.419 --> 31:00.700
On modern feminism and rape culture.

31:01.579 --> 31:04.618
Well, now you're uniquely placed.

31:04.619 --> 31:08.618
Duncan wants me to endorse his
campaign, "check me out", all that.

31:08.619 --> 31:10.298
Eugh, I'm not sure that will help.

31:10.299 --> 31:13.178
Maybe it's safer to keep him happy.

31:13.179 --> 31:14.378
Don't.

31:14.379 --> 31:16.058
Then he'll put it on the front page.

31:16.059 --> 31:17.778
So style it out.

31:17.779 --> 31:19.778
He's influential.

31:19.779 --> 31:21.538
He's a bully.

31:21.539 --> 31:23.579
Stand up to him. He likes that.

31:25.739 --> 31:27.059
Duncan Allen!

31:29.665 --> 31:31.105
Excuse me.

31:32.018 --> 31:33.298
Duncan Allen.

31:34.219 --> 31:36.898
- Hello.
- I'm Holly Evans from the Herald.

31:36.899 --> 31:39.458
- Holly Evans, right.
- Yeah, I know Tony at the coffee stand,

31:39.459 --> 31:41.778
he said you normally get coffee
around mid-afternoon

31:41.779 --> 31:43.258
so I got him to text me when you did.

31:43.259 --> 31:44.818
I'll never trust Tony again!

31:44.819 --> 31:48.138
I'm trying to find out about the
death of someone called Andrea Reed.

31:48.139 --> 31:50.178
She was hit by a police car on
Friday night

31:50.179 --> 31:51.618
and the car didn't stop.

31:51.619 --> 31:53.898
Apparently you've got a copy of the CCTV.

31:53.899 --> 31:56.738
I'd like to see it, but when
I called the Post you refused

31:56.739 --> 31:59.898
so I thought I might
be able to persuade you.

31:59.899 --> 32:00.950
What's the story?

32:00.975 --> 32:03.338
A witness says she was
hit by a police car.

32:03.339 --> 32:04.578
Was it an accident?

32:04.579 --> 32:07.258
Well, that's what they're saying,
but I don't know, that's why...

32:07.259 --> 32:11.258
We would've put a lot of resources,
I'm sure, into getting that footage

32:11.259 --> 32:14.018
and if there's a story, we're not
going to want to give it to you.

32:14.019 --> 32:15.150
There might not be.

32:15.175 --> 32:17.163
Well, if there's not a story,
why would you want it?

32:20.779 --> 32:22.698
This isn't usual journalistic practice,

32:22.699 --> 32:25.138
door-stepping the editor
of another paper.

32:25.139 --> 32:27.578
You seem very passionate about it.

32:27.579 --> 32:29.098
Yeah, yeah, I am.

32:29.099 --> 32:31.140
Actually, that's what I've heard.

32:31.859 --> 32:33.618
You've... what?

32:33.619 --> 32:35.458
Holly Evans.

32:35.459 --> 32:37.818
I don't forget a name.
I know who you are.

32:37.819 --> 32:40.778
I read a couple of your articles
from a few years ago.

32:40.779 --> 32:44.098
Well, one in particular.
Can you guess which one?

32:44.099 --> 32:45.498
Well, I'm sorry if...

32:45.499 --> 32:48.178
"A misogynist, overbearing
well-oiled bully.

32:48.179 --> 32:50.500
"An offence to journalism."

32:52.699 --> 32:56.020
You wrote that when, two years ago?

32:56.699 --> 32:58.660
About me.

32:59.179 --> 33:03.018
- Well, I'm...
- Well-oiled, what does that mean?

33:03.019 --> 33:05.418
Drunk, or something about my hair?

33:05.419 --> 33:07.618
- You can quote it.
- It hurt my feelings.

33:07.619 --> 33:09.578
Well, I'm really sorry
if you felt it was unfair,

33:09.579 --> 33:13.218
- but I really want to...
- Do you really want to see this footage?

33:13.219 --> 33:14.539
Yeah.

33:18.912 --> 33:19.952
Nah.

33:21.412 --> 33:22.652
Sorry.

33:39.299 --> 33:41.139
Five minutes.

34:03.320 --> 34:06.340
_

34:13.259 --> 34:15.418
Did you find out about the MI5 call?

34:15.418 --> 34:17.618
Yeah, yeah, they'd had a cyber attack.

34:17.619 --> 34:19.178
They weren't sure if anything leaked

34:19.179 --> 34:21.934
so they called all the news outlets
in a panic. False alarm.

34:21.935 --> 34:23.498
Right.

34:23.498 --> 34:26.818
- So not about your man, sorry.
- No, OK.

34:26.819 --> 34:28.099
All right, thanks.

34:32.760 --> 34:35.280
_

34:53.458 --> 34:55.098
Chris?

34:55.099 --> 34:56.217
James.

34:56.219 --> 34:57.738
You speak to people at MI5.

34:57.739 --> 34:59.498
You've got contacts.

34:59.499 --> 35:00.778
A few.

35:00.779 --> 35:04.340
Have you ever heard of a
programme called Resonance?

35:05.619 --> 35:07.178
No.

35:07.179 --> 35:08.739
Ah.

35:11.099 --> 35:15.258
Do you think you could
maybe discreetly ask around?

35:15.259 --> 35:17.020
See if it exists.

35:17.819 --> 35:19.139
I'll mention it.

35:21.459 --> 35:22.859
Thank you, thanks.

35:26.859 --> 35:29.418
I've sent Abi home cos we won't
be asking you to endorse

35:29.419 --> 35:33.138
the campaign any more,
but thanks for coming back.

35:33.139 --> 35:35.379
Do you want to sit down? You should.

35:48.379 --> 35:52.178
Mostly our purpose here
is quite a clear one,

35:52.179 --> 35:53.498
to entertain.

35:53.499 --> 35:56.578
So when we dig around,
that's what we're after.

35:56.579 --> 35:59.138
You know, life's hard and
our readers want a giggle,

35:59.139 --> 36:00.458
it's as simple as that.

36:00.459 --> 36:03.218
We do the news but we cheer people up.

36:03.219 --> 36:04.818
Duncan, I don't have time...

36:04.819 --> 36:07.860
This is the most important
meeting you'll have today.

36:08.459 --> 36:09.778
Maybe this year.

36:09.779 --> 36:12.458
So just bear with me, OK?

36:12.459 --> 36:17.058
I got my people to find out where
that photograph came from

36:17.059 --> 36:20.660
cos I thought that there might
be some more amusing shots.

36:21.899 --> 36:23.218
They're very talented.

36:23.219 --> 36:25.498
They, er, tracked down this old
friend of yours,

36:25.499 --> 36:27.379
who now hates you...

36:29.678 --> 36:31.118
...and he had these.

36:33.392 --> 36:34.512
Here.

36:38.425 --> 36:40.025
I mean, this one in particular.

36:41.659 --> 36:43.618
See, I don't do drugs.

36:43.619 --> 36:45.698
I mean, people find that hard to believe.

36:45.699 --> 36:48.298
It's not morality, I just, I just...

36:48.299 --> 36:50.299
I've tried them, I just don't like them.

36:53.219 --> 36:55.778
But you're an elected minister

36:55.779 --> 36:58.378
who's made many statements
about drug policy,

36:58.379 --> 37:01.580
who's advocated zero tolerance...

37:03.439 --> 37:04.519
...and who's been...

37:05.705 --> 37:07.265
...hiding this the whole time.

37:15.099 --> 37:17.580
You must've known it would come out.

37:19.099 --> 37:22.099
I didn't think there was a photograph.

37:24.919 --> 37:26.399
Glass house.

37:28.339 --> 37:29.538
What now?

37:29.539 --> 37:34.138
Barring an international atrocity,
this is on our front page tomorrow.

37:34.139 --> 37:38.098
So I suggest that we wrap it up
into a full confession.

37:38.099 --> 37:40.818
The party, the drugs,
what you were like as a student.

37:40.819 --> 37:42.818
You admit it all.

37:42.819 --> 37:45.580
Resign, probably.

37:46.419 --> 37:49.740
But if you come clean now, to us...

37:50.339 --> 37:53.179
...I don't see any reason
why you couldn't

37:53.538 --> 37:56.978
return to front-line politics
at some point.

37:58.479 --> 38:00.439
I'd be sad if this was
the end of your career.

38:01.339 --> 38:03.010
- Really?
- Yes.

38:03.011 --> 38:05.378
I think you're really good
at what you do.

38:05.379 --> 38:07.538
But maybe...

38:07.539 --> 38:10.300
...you'll be a little bit
less judgmental...

38:11.485 --> 38:13.405
...when you return.

38:15.719 --> 38:16.999
It's lucky I looked.

38:18.139 --> 38:20.138
What kind of journalist
would I be otherwise?

38:20.139 --> 38:23.218
Well, I suppose like
your friends at the Herald.

38:23.219 --> 38:25.060
No instinct for news.

38:26.059 --> 38:28.899
All principle, no trousers.

38:35.379 --> 38:37.338
Whenever you're ready,

38:37.339 --> 38:39.739
Raz will take you through it and...

38:40.965 --> 38:42.325
...we'll make a start.

39:38.419 --> 39:40.418
How did it go?

39:40.419 --> 39:42.339
Really very well indeed.

40:44.779 --> 40:46.299
Perfect. Let's go.

40:51.299 --> 40:52.739
Yeah, we're off stone.

41:06.979 --> 41:09.938
I'm grateful for the strong support
that I have received from

41:09.939 --> 41:15.378
my friends, family, the Chancellor
and the Prime Minister.

41:15.379 --> 41:19.498
I've decided that it is right to
tender my resignation as minister.

41:19.499 --> 41:23.178
I do not see how I can carry on my
crucial work while I have to deal

41:23.179 --> 41:28.458
with the private and public
implications of recent revelations.

41:28.459 --> 41:30.658
I hardly need to say how much I regret

41:30.659 --> 41:32.938
having to leave such vital work,

41:32.939 --> 41:35.098
which I feel all my life has
prepared me for.

41:36.379 --> 41:39.938
The last 24 hours have been very
difficult and distressing for me.

41:39.939 --> 41:41.709
I have been thinking carefully

41:41.710 --> 41:43.423
about what action I should take

41:43.424 --> 41:46.178
in the interest of the government,
my constituents

41:46.179 --> 41:48.778
and most important of all,
those whom I love.

41:48.779 --> 41:50.259
You at home tonight?

41:51.339 --> 41:53.900
- Why?
- Your wife's asking.

41:54.459 --> 41:56.940
- No.
- OK.

42:13.339 --> 42:14.458
It's good.

42:14.459 --> 42:17.698
It's not good enough. Sales are down.

42:17.699 --> 42:19.738
If we carry on like this,
we won't survive.

42:19.739 --> 42:22.378
It's fine but we need to take some risks.

42:22.379 --> 42:24.138
See you tomorrow.

42:24.139 --> 42:25.818
Bye.

42:25.819 --> 42:27.898
There's a risk right there.

42:27.899 --> 42:30.499
- What do you mean?
- There's something up with her today.

42:32.579 --> 42:35.260
Well, I'm going on a date.

42:36.099 --> 42:37.458
You? Who with?

42:37.459 --> 42:40.498
No idea. It's some internet thing.

42:40.499 --> 42:45.338
I don't want to go but it's what
you're supposed to do, isn't it?

42:45.339 --> 42:48.258
- After your marriage has ended.
- No, you'll have fun.

42:48.259 --> 42:49.578
You don't want a drink instead?

42:49.579 --> 42:52.098
No, sorry. I, erm,
I'm supposed to go home.

42:52.099 --> 42:54.138
Suzie's cooking a special risotto.

42:54.139 --> 42:55.978
What's so special about it?

42:55.979 --> 42:57.860
It's a special sort of mushroom.

42:58.779 --> 43:01.860
- Wow.
- Yeah, she can really cook.

43:02.419 --> 43:05.138
- Sounds it, you should go.
- Yeah.

43:05.139 --> 43:07.858
- Text me how it is.
- What's that?

43:07.859 --> 43:09.658
The risotto.

43:09.659 --> 43:11.618
No problem.

43:11.619 --> 43:13.339
- You have a good night.
- Bye.

43:16.059 --> 43:20.418
The picture on page 37 in the sports
section has the wrong caption.

43:20.419 --> 43:22.800
- Excellent. Last one?
- No idea.

43:28.579 --> 43:31.378
It says the French President
recognises the historic

43:31.379 --> 43:34.178
and ongoing relationship
between our two countries.

43:34.179 --> 43:35.818
What's wrong with that?

43:35.819 --> 43:38.935
Well, I saw the statement live on TV
and the President actually said

43:38.936 --> 43:40.938
that he recognised the historic
and current relationship

43:40.939 --> 43:42.197
between our two countries.

43:42.222 --> 43:45.380
- Current, not ongoing.
- Wow.

43:46.099 --> 43:47.658
Important distinction.

43:47.659 --> 43:50.298
- Your French is that good?
- I should've picked it up.

43:50.299 --> 43:52.900
You're a geek. Open your present.

44:00.259 --> 44:02.498
Oh! Everyone's wearing these.

44:02.499 --> 44:05.778
Yep, so now you're fashionable.

44:05.779 --> 44:08.338
Oh... A new experience for you.

44:08.339 --> 44:10.500
And also it's very soft.

44:12.459 --> 44:14.740
- Thanks.
- And, finally, to prove my point,

44:14.741 --> 44:17.058
- I'm going to take you for a drink.
- And what's your point?

44:17.059 --> 44:18.579
Birthdays are good.

44:21.379 --> 44:24.378
- So, what happened with your story?
- Dead end.

44:24.379 --> 44:26.099
Yeah, tell me about it.

44:58.939 --> 45:00.498
Well, this isn't bad.

45:00.499 --> 45:03.219
- Glad you approve.
- That's NOT what I said.

45:04.379 --> 45:06.499
I have very deep pockets.

45:07.579 --> 45:11.338
Which is lucky, as on its own,
the Post loses money.

45:11.339 --> 45:13.018
- You know that.
- I do.

45:13.019 --> 45:15.418
Then I need it to be the best.

45:15.419 --> 45:18.618
The best layouts, images,
the best online.

45:18.619 --> 45:21.818
These pictures are 30 years old

45:21.819 --> 45:25.738
and you've driven out a rather
competent minister, who I liked.

45:25.739 --> 45:30.180
And then, inside, a gossip story
about the death of a gay footballer.

45:32.419 --> 45:34.138
A picture of a treehouse.

45:34.139 --> 45:35.979
Biggest treehouse ever made.

45:37.019 --> 45:39.538
It's not news.

45:39.539 --> 45:42.660
Entertainment. Without it,
we won't sell papers.

45:43.459 --> 45:45.898
You don't need to tell me
how to sell papers.

45:45.899 --> 45:48.978
I don't make money from the Post,
I lose money,

45:48.979 --> 45:51.258
and in return I want journalism.

45:51.259 --> 45:53.219
You understand?

45:59.059 --> 46:01.738
You want money to get the best,
you've got it.

46:01.739 --> 46:04.738
Steal someone from another paper,
favours, more resources.

46:04.739 --> 46:07.418
- Whatever it takes.
- Sure.

46:07.419 --> 46:09.539
- No problem.
- Good.

46:12.019 --> 46:16.098
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a concert to go to.

46:16.099 --> 46:18.738
- Something nice?
- No.

46:18.739 --> 46:21.220
My grandson's learnt the violin.

46:22.219 --> 46:25.698
It's excruciating.

46:25.699 --> 46:28.779
But every time he plays, it makes me cry.

46:31.619 --> 46:33.179
How's your boy?

46:38.139 --> 46:39.619
You going home tonight?

47:56.779 --> 47:59.371
- Mm. You want another one?
- Yeah.

47:59.372 --> 48:00.467
- Same again?
- Yeah.

48:00.492 --> 48:01.572
All right.

48:19.480 --> 48:22.920
_

49:05.619 --> 49:06.659
Hi.

49:15.152 --> 49:16.352
You're Holly Evans.

49:17.459 --> 49:19.378
Ed Washburn.

49:19.379 --> 49:21.819
I wrote to you for a job at the Herald.

49:21.844 --> 49:23.098
OK.

49:23.099 --> 49:25.140
Didn't even give me an interview.

49:29.899 --> 49:31.299
Top up?

49:34.278 --> 49:35.878
Yeah, why not?

49:38.599 --> 49:40.079
I'm at the Post now.

49:41.099 --> 49:43.538
- Great.
- Mm.

49:43.539 --> 49:45.980
I did my first death knock today.

49:47.099 --> 49:48.898
Slammed the door in your face?

49:48.899 --> 49:50.938
No, worse.

49:50.939 --> 49:52.139
They let me in.

49:55.460 --> 49:57.498
I just got myself a story.

49:57.499 --> 49:59.098
Should be writing it.

49:59.099 --> 50:01.739
So why aren't you?

50:08.419 --> 50:10.418
Cos it's my birthday today.

50:10.419 --> 50:11.778
Haven't told anyone.

50:11.779 --> 50:14.059
Why haven't you told anyone?

50:14.338 --> 50:16.378
Cos I'm getting old.

50:18.419 --> 50:21.099
- Cheers, anyway.
- Cheers.

50:41.459 --> 50:42.899
Oh. Oh!

50:54.019 --> 50:56.858
Mm! I have an array of drinks
in the kitchen.

50:56.859 --> 50:58.858
We can do cocktails!

50:58.859 --> 51:02.018
I've got this bottle of grappa
so if you want a challenge,

51:02.019 --> 51:03.578
that's the thing to go for.

51:03.579 --> 51:05.173
Thought you said you had a flatmate?

51:05.174 --> 51:07.178
Yeah, Dee. Her room's over there.

51:07.179 --> 51:09.338
All right. Shall we be quiet?

51:09.339 --> 51:11.778
Nah. What do you want?

51:11.779 --> 51:13.899
- What?
- To drink.

51:14.540 --> 51:18.098
Grappa, grappa, grappa!

51:18.099 --> 51:20.859
- Gin and tonic.
- Boring!

51:24.459 --> 51:26.618
Is she asleep, then?

51:26.619 --> 51:28.019
The flatmate.

51:34.579 --> 51:36.739
No, no, she's not asleep.

51:39.859 --> 51:42.218
She made a birthday card for me.

51:42.219 --> 51:44.698
I found it in her room,
the day after it happened.

51:44.699 --> 51:47.060
Read it this morning, ripped it up.

51:54.485 --> 51:56.885
Her name's Andrea Reed,
but I call her Dee.

51:58.579 --> 52:01.418
Three days ago, she was walking
home after a night out,

52:01.419 --> 52:03.700
got hit by a police car and died.

52:04.179 --> 52:08.099
And now we know for sure that
the police car didn't even stop.

52:09.779 --> 52:11.699
I should write a story but...

52:13.859 --> 52:17.178
...I didn't tell anyone cos I don't
want them feeling sorry for me.

52:17.179 --> 52:19.178
But, you know, it's sad.

52:19.179 --> 52:20.578
Were you close?

52:20.579 --> 52:22.179
Friends since uni, so...

52:27.019 --> 52:29.780
I've spent the weekend wondering
if she was in pain.

52:30.299 --> 52:33.578
It was a while before the ambulance
turned up, apparently.

52:33.579 --> 52:36.058
If the car had stopped, not driven off,

52:36.059 --> 52:40.420
maybe he could've done something
and she'd still be here.

52:41.419 --> 52:42.820
Oh, well.

52:43.579 --> 52:45.418
Death knock.

52:45.419 --> 52:47.778
Clink. Well done.

52:47.779 --> 52:50.940
- You haven't spoken to anyone?
- No-one to speak to.

52:53.285 --> 52:55.045
Well, maybe we should leave it.

52:56.139 --> 52:59.979
Just because I'm in a state of
mourning doesn't mean we can't fuck.

53:00.172 --> 53:01.532
You don't seem OK.

53:07.339 --> 53:09.485
- I'm not sure you're...
- Fine.

53:10.005 --> 53:11.325
Leave.

53:19.059 --> 53:21.539
And you should feel bad
about what you did today.

53:25.292 --> 53:26.932
It means you're still human.

53:28.019 --> 53:29.938
Only get worried when you see
stuff like that

53:29.939 --> 53:31.339
and you feel nothing at all.

53:36.952 --> 53:38.232
Write the story.

53:40.338 --> 53:41.898
Bye.

Times are tough, could be us next.

A year ago, I think you were braver.

57:03.899 --> 57:05.618
I want to save this marriage.

57:05.619 --> 57:07.618
Are you the organ grinder or the monkey?

57:07.619 --> 57:09.060
I'm a reporter.

57:09.899 --> 57:11.138
I'm the monkey.

57:11.139 --> 57:13.618
I also found some articles you
wrote when you were a reporter.

57:13.619 --> 57:16.178
Proper journalism.
Long way from what you do now.

57:16.179 --> 57:18.619
Maybe you should take
a closer look at what we do.
