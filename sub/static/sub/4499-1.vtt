00:11.680 --> 00:14.638
<i>It all began
on New Year's Day...</i>

00:14.680 --> 00:17.930
<i>in my thirty-second year
of being single.</i>

00:19.180 --> 00:21.555
<i>Once again,
I found myself on my own...</i>

00:21.596 --> 00:25.888
<i>and going to my mother's
annual turkey curry buffet.</i>

00:25.930 --> 00:27.437
<i>Every year,
she tries to fix me up...</i>

00:27.472 --> 00:29.847
<i>with some bushy-haired,
middle-aged bore...</i>

00:29.889 --> 00:33.097
<i>and I feared this year
would be no exception.</i>

00:33.139 --> 00:34.972
There you are, dumpling.

00:35.014 --> 00:36.639
My mum...

00:36.681 --> 00:38.056
a strange creature
from the time...

00:38.097 --> 00:39.472
when a gherkin...

00:39.514 --> 00:40.974
was still the height
of sophistication.

00:41.016 --> 00:42.641
Doilies, Pam?
Hello, Bridget.

00:42.683 --> 00:44.808
Third drawer from the top, Una.

00:44.849 --> 00:46.773
Under the mini gherkins.

00:46.808 --> 00:51.016
By the way, the Darcys are here.
They brought Mark with them.

00:51.058 --> 00:52.641
Ah, here we go.

00:52.683 --> 00:54.058
You remember Mark.

00:54.099 --> 00:55.767
You used to play
in his paddling pool.

00:55.809 --> 00:57.642
He's a barrister.
Very well off.

00:57.677 --> 00:59.684
No, I don't remember.

00:59.725 --> 01:01.642
He's divorced, apparently.

01:01.684 --> 01:04.099
His wife was Japanese.
Very cruel race.

01:04.141 --> 01:05.850
Now, what are you
going to put on?

01:05.892 --> 01:07.017
This.

01:07.059 --> 01:08.934
Oh, don’t be silly,
Bridget.

01:08.975 --> 01:10.101
You'll never get a boyfriend...

01:10.143 --> 01:12.101
if you look like you've
wandered out of Auschwitz.

01:12.226 --> 01:13.185
Now, run upstairs.

01:13.226 --> 01:15.185
I've laid out something
lovely on your bed.

01:18.435 --> 01:21.539
You're just too good to be true

01:21.574 --> 01:24.644
Can’t take my eyes off of you

01:24.686 --> 01:27.790
Great.
I was wearing a carpet.

01:27.825 --> 01:30.894
There she is.

01:30.936 --> 01:34.894
My little Bridget

01:34.936 --> 01:37.436
Hi, Uncle Geoffrey.

01:37.477 --> 01:38.771
- Hmm. Had a drink?
- No.

01:38.806 --> 01:40.063
No? Come on, then.

01:40.104 --> 01:41.813
Actually, not my uncle.

01:41.854 --> 01:43.604
Someone who insists
I call him uncle...

01:43.646 --> 01:44.938
while he gropes my ass...

01:44.979 --> 01:48.063
and asks me the question
dreaded by all Singletons.

01:48.104 --> 01:51.146
So... how's your love life?

01:51.188 --> 01:53.439
Super. Thanks, Uncle G.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.730
Still no fellow, then, eh?
I don't know.

01:55.765 --> 01:57.980
You career girls.
Can't put it off forever.

01:58.022 --> 01:59.897
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

01:59.939 --> 02:02.480
- Hello, Dad.
- Hello, darling.

02:02.522 --> 02:04.105
How's it going?

02:04.147 --> 02:05.689
Torture.

02:05.730 --> 02:08.646
Your mother’s trying to
fix you up with some divorcee.

02:10.146 --> 02:13.189
Human-rights barrister.
Pretty nasty beast, apparently.

02:13.230 --> 02:16.647
Hoo. Ding-dong.

02:16.689 --> 02:19.564
Maybe this time
Mum had got it right.

02:19.605 --> 02:22.898
Come on. Why don’t we see
if Mark fancies a gherkin?

02:22.933 --> 02:24.898
Good luck.

02:24.981 --> 02:26.481
Mark?

02:26.523 --> 02:29.190
Maybe this was
the mysterious Mr. Right...

02:29.231 --> 02:31.981
I’d been waiting
my whole life to meet.

02:32.065 --> 02:35.148
You remember Bridget.

02:35.190 --> 02:36.942
Maybe not.

02:36.983 --> 02:38.733
She's used to
run around your lawn...

02:38.775 --> 02:40.942
with no clothes on, remember?

02:40.983 --> 02:43.025
Uh, no, not as such.

02:44.733 --> 02:45.942
Come and look
at your gravy, Pam.

02:45.983 --> 02:47.858
I think it's going
to need sieving.

02:47.900 --> 02:49.067
Of course it doesn't
need sieving.

02:49.108 --> 02:50.859
Just stir it, Una.

02:52.651 --> 02:54.151
Yes, of course.
I'll be right there.

02:54.193 --> 02:57.151
Sorry. Lumpy gravy calls.

02:57.193 --> 02:59.609
Let me love you

03:01.109 --> 03:04.068
- So...
- So.

03:04.109 --> 03:07.235
You staying at your parents'
for New Year?

03:07.444 --> 03:08.819
Yes.

03:08.860 --> 03:10.235
- You?
- Oh, no, no, no.

03:10.444 --> 03:12.444
I was in London
at a party last night...

03:12.485 --> 03:14.784
so I'm afraid
I'm a bit hung over.

03:14.819 --> 03:16.735
Wish I could be lying
with my head in the toilet...

03:16.777 --> 03:18.235
Like all normal people.

03:20.236 --> 03:22.945
New Year's resolution...
drink less.

03:22.980 --> 03:25.945
Oh, and quit smoking.

03:28.695 --> 03:31.070
And keep New Year's resolutions.

03:32.861 --> 03:35.787
Oh. And...

03:35.822 --> 03:38.780
stop talking total nonsense
to strangers.

03:38.822 --> 03:41.759
In fact, stop talking,
full stop.

03:41.794 --> 03:44.697
Yes, well,
perhaps it's time to eat.

03:45.738 --> 03:47.537
I need you, baby

03:47.572 --> 03:48.530
Apparently...

03:49.531 --> 03:50.614
she lives just 'round
the corner from you.

03:50.656 --> 03:53.198
Mother, I do not need
a blind date.

03:53.239 --> 03:55.864
Particularly not with some
verbally incontinent spinster...

03:55.906 --> 03:57.739
who smokes like a chimney,
drinks like a fish...

03:57.774 --> 03:59.781
and dresses like her mother.

04:02.448 --> 04:04.156
Yummy.

04:04.198 --> 04:06.052
Turkey curry.

04:06.087 --> 04:07.906
My favourite.

04:07.989 --> 04:10.823
And that was it.
Right there.

04:10.864 --> 04:13.781
Right there.
That was the moment.

04:15.989 --> 04:19.156
I suddenly realized that unless
some thing changed soon...

04:19.199 --> 04:21.865
I was going to live a life
where my major relationship...

04:21.906 --> 04:23.782
was with a bottle of wine...

04:23.824 --> 04:26.990
and I'd finally die
fat and alone...

04:27.032 --> 04:30.782
and be found three weeks later,
half-eaten by Alsatians.

04:30.824 --> 04:33.492
Or I was about to
turn into Glenn Close...

04:33.534 --> 04:34.951
in "Fatal Attraction. "

04:36.576 --> 04:42.826
All by myself

04:42.867 --> 04:44.784
Don't wanna be

04:44.826 --> 04:49.160
All by myself

04:49.195 --> 04:52.160
Anymore

04:52.202 --> 04:54.785
You have no messages.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.074

05:21.120 --> 05:22.995
When I was young

05:24.579 --> 05:27.954
I never needed anyone

05:30.664 --> 05:34.247
And making' love
was just for fun

05:36.622 --> 05:39.122
Those days are gone

05:44.498 --> 05:49.498
All by myself

05:50.665 --> 05:52.248
Don't wanna be

05:52.457 --> 05:56.832
All by myself

05:56.873 --> 06:01.832
Anymore

06:18.083 --> 06:23.583
All by myself

06:24.624 --> 06:27.749
Don't wanna live...

06:27.793 --> 06:29.835
And so I made
a major decision.

06:29.876 --> 06:31.216
I had to make sure
that next year...

06:31.251 --> 06:34.543
I wouldn't end up shit-faced
and listening to sad FM...

06:34.585 --> 06:37.272
easy-listening
for the over-thirties.

06:37.307 --> 06:39.960
I decided to take
control of my life...

06:40.001 --> 06:41.501
and start a diary...

06:41.543 --> 06:44.169
to tell the truth
about Bridget Jones...

06:44.211 --> 06:45.586
the whole truth.

06:47.002 --> 06:49.127
Resolution number one...

06:50.002 --> 06:50.961
obviously will lose
twenty pounds.

06:50.996 --> 06:51.877
Number two...

06:51.919 --> 06:54.419
always put last night’s panties
in the laundry basket.

06:54.461 --> 06:55.877
Equally important...

06:55.919 --> 06:58.503
will find nice sensible
boyfriend to go out with...

06:58.545 --> 07:00.545
and not continue to form
romantic attachments...

07:00.587 --> 07:02.170
to any of the following...

07:02.212 --> 07:04.587
alcoholics, workaholics,
commitment-phobics...

07:04.628 --> 07:06.232
peeping toms, megalomaniacs...

07:06.267 --> 07:07.837
emotional fuckwits,
or perverts.

07:07.878 --> 07:10.587
And especially
will not fantasize...

07:10.628 --> 07:15.129
about a particular person
who embodies all these things.

07:15.171 --> 07:18.213
What you want

07:18.463 --> 07:20.546
Baby, I got

07:20.588 --> 07:22.254
What you need

07:22.463 --> 07:23.879
Do you know I got it?

07:23.921 --> 07:27.256
Unfortunately, he
just happens to be my boss...

07:27.506 --> 07:29.548
Editor-in-Chief,
Daniel Cleaver.

07:29.590 --> 07:31.652
And for various
slightly unfair reasons...

07:31.687 --> 07:33.715
relating to this year's
Christmas party...

07:33.756 --> 07:37.590
I suspect he does not
fantasize about me.

07:39.798 --> 07:43.924
Can’t live

07:43.966 --> 07:47.591
If living is without you

07:47.632 --> 07:52.257
I can’t live

07:52.299 --> 07:53.882
Can't give anymore

07:53.924 --> 07:56.507
Or maybe I'm wrong.

08:08.132 --> 08:10.467
Happy New Year, Mr. Fitzherbert.

08:10.508 --> 08:11.842
Happy New Year, Brenda.

08:11.883 --> 08:14.550
Mr. Fitzherbert...
Tits Pervert, more like.

08:14.592 --> 08:16.467
Daniel's boss who stares
freely at my breasts...

08:16.508 --> 08:19.258
with no idea who I am
or what I do.

08:19.467 --> 08:21.633
Morning. I need that
"Kafka's Motorbike" release...

08:21.675 --> 08:22.842
by 11:00.

08:22.883 --> 08:25.510
Perpetua...
slightly senior...

08:25.552 --> 08:27.510
and therefore thinks
she's in charge of me.

08:27.594 --> 08:28.760
Most of the time...

08:28.802 --> 08:31.427
I just want to staple things
to her head.

08:32.677 --> 08:33.885
Publicity.

08:33.927 --> 08:35.802
All I asked...
I only asked...

08:35.844 --> 08:38.595
if he wanted to come on
a mini-break to Paris...

08:38.635 --> 08:40.595
Daily call from Jude.
Best friend.

08:40.635 --> 08:42.635
Head of investment
at Brightlings Bank...

08:42.678 --> 08:44.178
who spends most of her time...

08:44.220 --> 08:47.095
trapped in the lady's toilet,
crying over fuck wit boyfriend.

08:47.130 --> 08:48.761
I'm too needy.

08:48.803 --> 08:50.261
Am I co-dependent?

08:50.470 --> 08:51.845
No, you’re not.

08:51.886 --> 08:53.971
It's not you.
You're lovely.

08:54.012 --> 08:55.929
It's Vile Richard.

08:55.971 --> 08:58.929
Ugh. He's just a big knobhead
with no knob.

09:00.804 --> 09:05.221
Is some people's
opinion of Kafka...

09:05.262 --> 09:07.138
but they couldn't
be more wrong.

09:07.222 --> 09:08.722
This book is
a searing vision...

09:08.763 --> 09:10.888
of the wounds our century
has inflicted on...

09:10.930 --> 09:13.388
on traditional masculinity.

09:13.423 --> 09:15.847
It's positively Vonnegut-esque.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.847
Thank you for calling,
Professor Leavis.

09:19.138 --> 09:21.932
Guest list for launch party.

09:24.640 --> 09:28.099
Was that... F.R. Leavis?

09:33.182 --> 09:34.890
The F.R. Leavis...

09:34.932 --> 09:37.683
who wrote "Mass Civilization
and Minority Culture"?

09:39.225 --> 09:42.933
The F.R. Leavis
who died in 1978?

09:45.975 --> 09:47.766
Amazing.

09:50.475 --> 09:52.225
Emergency summit
with urban family...

09:52.266 --> 09:54.683
for coherent discussion
of career crisis.

09:54.725 --> 09:56.975
Fuck 'em.
Fuck the lot of them.

09:57.016 --> 09:59.058
Tell them they can stick
fucking Leavis...

09:59.141 --> 10:00.933
up their fucking asses.

10:00.975 --> 10:03.558
Good, good.
That's very useful, very useful.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.267
Shazzer... journalist...

10:05.302 --> 10:06.934
Likes to say "fuck" a lot.

10:06.976 --> 10:09.517
And, Jude, what would you do
if one of your assistants...

10:09.559 --> 10:11.767
made a harmless
little mistake like that?

10:11.851 --> 10:13.184
I'd fire you, Bridge.

10:13.226 --> 10:14.892
Excellent.

10:14.976 --> 10:17.184
Is that Cleaver chap
still as cute as ever?

10:17.226 --> 10:18.607
Oh, God, yes.

10:18.642 --> 10:20.644
Then I think
a well-timed blow job's...

10:20.679 --> 10:21.776
probably the best answer.

10:21.999 --> 10:23.144
Oh, you love it.

10:23.186 --> 10:25.519
Are you that chap
that sang that song?

10:25.561 --> 10:27.228
Yes. Yes, I am.

10:27.269 --> 10:28.936
Tom...
Eighties pop icon

10:28.978 --> 10:31.061
who only wrote
one hit record...

10:31.103 --> 10:33.061
then retired because
he found that one record...

10:33.103 --> 10:34.562
was quite enough
to get him laid...

10:34.604 --> 10:36.062
for the whole of the Nineties.

10:36.104 --> 10:38.729
- Great song.
- Thank you so much.

10:38.770 --> 10:40.457
Total poof, of course.

10:40.492 --> 10:42.110
- More vodka?
- No.

10:42.145 --> 10:45.062
Yes.
Fill her up, God damn it.

10:45.104 --> 10:46.729
At least
now I'm in my thirties...

10:46.770 --> 10:47.937
I can hold my drink.

10:51.896 --> 10:55.146
- Mind the step.
- She's fine. Drive on.

10:55.480 --> 10:59.730
Apparently
F.R. Leavis is coming.

11:01.730 --> 11:03.731
Afternoon, Bridget.

11:03.814 --> 11:06.897
What do you mean
you're going on holiday?

11:06.939 --> 11:09.856
Well, what about Julia?

11:11.981 --> 11:15.147
Does she have to go
to the funeral?

11:39.484 --> 11:42.067
Listen, we got
a little problem...

11:43.984 --> 11:46.984
The only problem
is the kitchen.

11:47.025 --> 11:48.942
Quite frankly,
there isn’t room...

11:48.984 --> 11:52.067
Message Mr. Cleaver.

11:52.109 --> 11:54.615
Am appalled by message.

11:54.650 --> 11:58.692
Skirt is demonstrably
neither sick nor absent.

11:58.734 --> 12:01.860
Appalled by management's
blatantly size-is attitude...

12:01.895 --> 12:03.026
to skirt.

12:03.068 --> 12:06.776
Suggest management sick,
not skirt!

12:06.818 --> 12:08.818
That's quite ridiculous.

12:08.853 --> 12:10.985
Ooh. Oh, I see.

12:11.026 --> 12:12.693
Hang on. Hang on.

12:19.820 --> 12:22.278
Right. Yeah.

12:22.487 --> 12:24.243
No, I understand that.

12:24.278 --> 12:26.028
I understand that perfectly.

12:31.529 --> 12:33.988
Very bad start to the year.

12:34.029 --> 12:35.863
Have been seduced
by informality...

12:35.904 --> 12:39.154
of messaging medium into
flirting with office scoundrel.

12:39.196 --> 12:43.654
Will persevere with resolution
to find a nice sensible man.

12:43.689 --> 12:47.489
Will put a stop to flirting...
first thing tomorrow.

12:47.530 --> 12:48.905
Good plan.

12:56.155 --> 12:57.780
Don't get me wrong

12:57.864 --> 12:59.073
If walking past office...

12:59.115 --> 13:01.031
was attempt to demonstrate
presence of skirt...

13:01.066 --> 13:03.240
can only say that it
has failed parlously.

13:03.281 --> 13:04.823
Cleave.

13:04.865 --> 13:07.948
Shut up, please.
I'm very busy and important.

13:07.990 --> 13:10.781
P.S. How dare you
sexually harass me...

13:10.823 --> 13:13.117
in this impertinent manner.

13:13.158 --> 13:14.582
Message Jones.

13:14.617 --> 13:15.867
Mortified to have
caused offence.

13:15.908 --> 13:18.283
Will avoid all
non-P.C. overtones in future.

13:18.492 --> 13:19.950
Deeply apologetic.

13:19.992 --> 13:22.658
P.S. Like your tits
in that top.

13:24.492 --> 13:26.033
I'm thinking
about the fireworks

13:26.075 --> 13:28.118
Mustn’t read
too much into it, no.

13:28.159 --> 13:29.909
Dum dum dee dum

13:29.993 --> 13:32.701
Dum dum dee dum,
dum dum dee dum dum

13:32.743 --> 13:33.993
And it all began, of course...

13:34.034 --> 13:35.951
with some very
irresponsible e-mailing...

13:35.993 --> 13:38.201
over Bridget's
non-existent skirt.

13:38.243 --> 13:41.909
If I split
like light refracted

13:43.659 --> 13:46.201
I'm only off to wander

13:47.701 --> 13:50.597
Daniel.
The New York office for you.

13:50.632 --> 13:53.493
Yeah, tell them
I'll get back to them.

13:54.868 --> 13:56.577
Once in a while

14:04.910 --> 14:06.577
Daniel.

14:06.619 --> 14:07.785
Jones...

14:07.827 --> 14:09.910
- Evening, Kenneth.
- Good evening, Daniel.

14:13.662 --> 14:15.621
If you've got a moment...

14:15.662 --> 14:17.079
I'd like a word
before you leave tonight.

14:17.121 --> 14:18.621
Yes, certainly.

14:21.787 --> 14:23.954
- I'll see you in a sec.
- Excellent.

14:23.996 --> 14:25.580
- And, Brenda...
- Yes?

14:25.622 --> 14:27.122
At the "Kafka's Motorbike"
thing...

14:27.163 --> 14:29.163
I thought it might be fun
if you introduce me...

14:29.205 --> 14:30.587
before I introduce him.

14:30.622 --> 14:32.622
Add a lovely sense of occasion.

14:34.663 --> 14:36.205
Certainly, sir.

14:38.122 --> 14:40.706
Tch. Brenda, listen.

14:40.748 --> 14:42.289
What are you doing tonight?

14:42.498 --> 14:43.963
Actually, I'm busy.

14:43.998 --> 14:47.789
All right. Well, that’s a shame.
I just...

14:47.831 --> 14:49.289
well, I thought it might
be a charitable thing...

14:49.331 --> 14:50.706
to take your skirt out
for dinner...

14:50.748 --> 14:51.873
and try and fatten it up a bit.

14:52.114 --> 14:54.582
Maybe you can come, too.

14:54.624 --> 14:56.749
What about tomorrow?

14:56.790 --> 14:58.832
No. Tomorrow's the launch.

14:58.874 --> 15:00.582
Ah, yes, of course.

15:00.665 --> 15:02.665
Possibly the worst book
ever published.

15:02.749 --> 15:07.499
Well, in the end, that’s not
the ad line we've gone for.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.084
Next night?

15:09.126 --> 15:10.584
Let's see, shall we?

15:11.751 --> 15:13.132
Good night, Daniel.

15:13.167 --> 15:15.667
Right. No pressure, Bridge...

15:15.709 --> 15:19.209
but your whole future happiness
now depends on how you behave...

15:19.251 --> 15:20.959
on this one social occasion.

15:21.084 --> 15:22.834
Right. What should I do?

15:22.876 --> 15:24.710
First, look gorgeous.

15:39.502 --> 15:43.877
Two... then totally ignore Daniel
and suck up to famous authors.

15:43.918 --> 15:45.585
Salman.

15:45.627 --> 15:47.502
Salman. Salman.

15:47.543 --> 15:49.835
Circulate.

15:49.877 --> 15:51.961
Oozing intelligence.

15:52.003 --> 15:56.753
Isn't it terrible
about Chechnya?

15:56.794 --> 15:58.211
Chech-nya!

15:58.253 --> 15:59.919
Introduce people
with thoughtful details...

15:59.961 --> 16:02.086
such as, "Sheila...

16:02.128 --> 16:04.669
"This is Daniel.
Daniel, this is Sheila.

16:04.711 --> 16:07.630
"Sheila enjoys horse-riding
and comes from New Zealand.

16:07.671 --> 16:09.755
"Daniel enjoys publishing
and comes... "

16:09.796 --> 16:11.046
All over your face?

16:11.081 --> 16:12.130
Exactly.

16:12.171 --> 16:13.713
Excuse me.

16:13.755 --> 16:16.053
I'm terribly sorry
to interrupt you...

16:16.088 --> 16:17.963
when you're having dinner.
It's just that...

16:18.005 --> 16:20.547
Yes. Yes, it was me.

16:20.582 --> 16:23.089
Yes. Nine years ago.

16:23.131 --> 16:24.964
No current plans
to record anything else.

16:25.006 --> 16:26.297
Thank you so much.

16:26.339 --> 16:28.089
Oh, it's just that, ahem...

16:28.131 --> 16:31.297
your... your chair
is on my wife's coat.

16:32.964 --> 16:34.756
Your... your chair on the...

16:34.797 --> 16:36.798
Of course it is.
Of course it is.

16:36.882 --> 16:38.507
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

16:38.548 --> 16:40.923
Hmm. Major dilemma.

16:40.965 --> 16:42.673
If actually do,
by some terrible chance...

16:42.715 --> 16:44.257
end up in flagrante...

16:44.298 --> 16:47.757
surely these would be most
attractive at crucial moment.

16:47.792 --> 16:49.924
However, chances of
reaching crucial moment...

16:49.966 --> 16:52.299
greatly increase
by wearing these.

16:52.334 --> 16:54.633
Scary stomach-holding-in
panties.

16:54.674 --> 16:57.091
Very popular with grannies
the world over.

16:57.133 --> 17:00.841
Ha. Tricky. Very tricky.

17:16.300 --> 17:17.800
Ladies and gentlemen...

17:17.843 --> 17:20.636
welcome to the launch
of "Kafka's Motorbike"...

17:20.676 --> 17:22.051
"The Greatest Book
of Our Time"...

17:22.094 --> 17:24.886
and here to introduce it
is Mr. Tits Pervert.

17:24.926 --> 17:27.886
Ooh, Fitzherbert,
Fitzherbert, Fitzherbert.

17:29.052 --> 17:32.969
OK, circulate,
oozing intelligence.

17:33.011 --> 17:36.302
Ignore Daniel, and be fabulous
with everyone else.

17:36.511 --> 17:40.261
I am the intellectual equal
of everyone else here.

17:40.302 --> 17:41.594
Ooh.

17:41.636 --> 17:43.844
It's like a whole theory
of short fiction...

17:43.886 --> 17:45.636
and of the novella, you know?

17:45.677 --> 17:46.886
And, of course, the problem...

17:46.927 --> 17:48.678
with Martin's definition
of the novella...

17:48.720 --> 17:50.095
is that it really
only applies to him.

17:53.053 --> 17:55.137
That doesn't
sound like Martin.

17:55.178 --> 17:57.303
Not.

17:57.512 --> 17:59.720
I could be wrong.
What do you think?

17:59.762 --> 18:04.180
Uh... do you know...

18:05.555 --> 18:10.014
where the toilets are, huh?

18:10.055 --> 18:13.805
Stay calm.
Can't get any worse.

18:16.765 --> 18:18.931
What are you doing here?

18:18.973 --> 18:22.181
I've been asking myself
the same question.

18:22.223 --> 18:24.265
I came with a colleague.

18:24.306 --> 18:25.681
So how are you?

18:25.723 --> 18:27.640
Well, apart from being
very disappointed...

18:27.681 --> 18:30.765
not to see my favourite
reindeer jumper again...

18:30.806 --> 18:32.057
I'm well.

18:32.099 --> 18:33.891
Anyone going to introduce me?

18:33.932 --> 18:37.224
Ah, introduce people
with thoughtful details.

18:37.266 --> 18:38.974
Perpetua.

18:39.016 --> 18:40.807
This is Mark Darcy.

18:40.932 --> 18:42.974
Mark's a prematurely
middle-aged prick...

18:43.016 --> 18:44.766
with a cruel-racedex-wife.

18:44.807 --> 18:46.183
Perpetua's a fat-ass old bag...

18:46.225 --> 18:48.142
who spends her time
bossing me around.

18:49.850 --> 18:51.642
Maybe not.

18:51.683 --> 18:52.975
Anyone going to introduce me?

18:53.017 --> 18:55.523
Ah, Perpetua.

18:55.558 --> 18:57.600
Uh, this is Mark Darcy.

18:57.642 --> 18:59.600
Mark's a top barrister.

18:59.642 --> 19:01.852
Oh, he comes from
Garth and Underwood.

19:01.894 --> 19:03.852
Perpetua is one
of my work colleagues.

19:03.894 --> 19:06.560
Why, Mark, I know you
by reputation, of course.

19:08.644 --> 19:10.144
Ah, Natasha.

19:10.185 --> 19:12.769
This is Bridget Jones.
Bridget, this is Natasha.

19:12.810 --> 19:16.061
Natasha is a top attorney
and specializes in family law.

19:16.145 --> 19:17.520
Bridget works in publishing...

19:17.561 --> 19:19.936
and used to play naked
in my paddling pool.

19:21.311 --> 19:23.770
How odd.

19:23.811 --> 19:25.686
Perpetua,
how's the house hunt going?

19:25.728 --> 19:27.228
Disaster.

19:27.270 --> 19:29.561
I oughtn't go into it with you.

19:29.645 --> 19:33.603
By the by, that man is gorgeous.

19:33.645 --> 19:35.061
Ah, yes, Mark.

19:35.103 --> 19:37.353
Just give me time.
Give me time.

19:38.811 --> 19:41.103
"You've written
a searing vision... "

19:41.186 --> 19:42.811
Can you remember
the rest of this?

19:42.853 --> 19:44.271
"Of the wounds
our century...

19:44.312 --> 19:46.812
"has inflicted on
traditional masculinity.

19:46.854 --> 19:48.812
"Positively Vonnegut-esgue. "
Obviously.

19:50.937 --> 19:52.937
Listen, you don't know where
the loos are here, do you?

19:52.979 --> 19:54.937
Uh, yes. In the hallway.

19:54.979 --> 19:56.104
Thanks.

20:00.273 --> 20:01.564
One, two.

20:04.814 --> 20:06.898
Ladies and gentlemen.

20:06.933 --> 20:08.773
I...

20:10.856 --> 20:13.024
L-ladies and...

20:13.059 --> 20:14.857
I...

20:14.899 --> 20:17.482
Oi!

20:19.524 --> 20:21.072
Sorry. The...

20:21.107 --> 20:24.565
mike's not...
work... working.

20:24.607 --> 20:27.150
Ladies and gentlemen...

20:27.233 --> 20:32.691
welcome to the launch
of "Kafka's Motorbike"...

20:32.733 --> 20:35.733
"The Greatest Book of Our Time. "

20:39.650 --> 20:44.151
Obviously except for
your books, Mr. Rushdie...

20:44.192 --> 20:47.776
which are also very good.

20:50.567 --> 20:52.734
And Lord Archer...

20:52.776 --> 20:55.903
yours aren’t bad, either.

20:55.944 --> 20:57.319
Anyway...

20:57.528 --> 20:59.778
uh, what I mean is...

20:59.819 --> 21:01.903
welcome,
ladies and gentlemen.

21:01.944 --> 21:05.402
Thank you for coming
to the launch of...

21:05.437 --> 21:08.861
one of the top thirty
books of our time.

21:08.896 --> 21:11.987
Anyway, at least.

21:12.029 --> 21:15.279
And here
to introduce it...

21:15.320 --> 21:16.945
properly...

21:16.987 --> 21:19.654
is, uh, the man
we all call...

21:19.695 --> 21:21.904
Tits Pervert.

21:21.945 --> 21:23.112
Mr...

21:23.154 --> 21:24.237
Tits Pervert!

21:24.279 --> 21:26.029
Mr...

21:27.612 --> 21:28.737
Tits Pervert.

21:28.779 --> 21:30.695
Fitzherbert...

21:30.730 --> 21:32.237
because...

21:32.279 --> 21:35.779
that is his name.

21:35.904 --> 21:38.112
Mr. Fitzherbert.

21:39.280 --> 21:40.780
Thank you.

21:45.321 --> 21:46.988
Thank you, Brenda.

21:48.905 --> 21:50.946
Just switch this on.

21:55.115 --> 21:56.698
So how
autobiographical...

21:56.740 --> 21:58.198
is your work, Salman?

21:58.240 --> 21:59.615
You know,
it's an amazing thing...

21:59.657 --> 22:01.573
nobody's ever asked me
that question.

22:01.615 --> 22:03.198
Excuse me.

22:03.240 --> 22:05.865
Jones. Sod 'em all.

22:05.907 --> 22:08.283
It was a brilliant...

22:08.324 --> 22:13.658
post-modernist masterpiece of
oratorical fireworks, really.

22:14.866 --> 22:16.623
You're looking very sexy, Jones.

22:16.658 --> 22:18.699
I think I'm gonna have to
take you out to dinner now...

22:18.734 --> 22:20.824
whether you like it or not, OK?

22:20.866 --> 22:22.033
Come on, get your stuff.

22:29.700 --> 22:31.909
So how do you feel about
this whole situation...

22:31.950 --> 22:33.784
in Chechnya?
isn’t it a nightmare?

22:33.825 --> 22:35.159
I couldn't give a fuck, Jones.

22:35.242 --> 22:39.076
Now, look, how do you
know Arsey Darcy?

22:39.118 --> 22:42.076
Apparently, I used
to run 'round naked...

22:42.118 --> 22:43.576
in his paddling pool.

22:43.618 --> 22:45.826
I bet you did, you dirty bitch.

22:45.868 --> 22:47.951
What about you?

22:47.993 --> 22:49.618
Same. Yeah.

22:51.118 --> 22:54.328
No, no, I was best man
at his wedding.

22:54.370 --> 22:56.037
Um, knew him from Cambridge.

22:56.078 --> 22:57.328
He was a mate.

22:57.370 --> 22:59.370
And then what?

22:59.537 --> 23:02.745
And then, uh... nothing.

23:02.787 --> 23:05.287
You don't need to protect him.
He's no friend of mine.

23:05.328 --> 23:07.871
Well, um, then...

23:07.913 --> 23:10.079
many years later...

23:10.121 --> 23:13.621
I made the somewhat
catastrophic mistake...

23:13.663 --> 23:18.038
of introducing him
to my fiancée.

23:21.329 --> 23:22.954
And...

23:25.663 --> 23:29.579
I couldn't say, in all honesty,
I've ever quite forgiven him.

23:29.621 --> 23:31.996
God, so...

23:32.038 --> 23:35.039
he's a nasty bastard.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.830
And a dull bastard.

23:36.872 --> 23:39.087
Yes. Yes,
I think that's fair.

23:39.122 --> 23:42.080
Anyway, fuck him. Listen,
don't let him ruin our evening.

23:42.115 --> 23:43.789
Why don't you have
some more wine...

23:43.830 --> 23:45.705
and tell me more about
practicing French-kissing...

23:45.747 --> 23:46.872
with the other girls
at school...

23:46.914 --> 23:47.997
because that's
a very good story.

23:48.039 --> 23:50.749
- It wasn’t French-kissing.
- Don't care. Make it up.

23:50.791 --> 23:52.672
That's an order, Jones.

23:52.707 --> 23:55.332
So, um, how about
a drink at my place?

23:55.582 --> 23:57.832
Totally innocent,
no funny business...

23:57.874 --> 23:59.832
just full sex.

24:00.916 --> 24:02.582
No, no, no.

24:02.624 --> 24:04.708
I should get a taxi.

24:04.750 --> 24:07.917
But thank you
for the lovely dinner.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.083
It's a pleasure, Jones.

24:17.250 --> 24:20.168
Oh, love

24:20.209 --> 24:22.209
Love, love

24:29.668 --> 24:31.626
You're alone

24:31.668 --> 24:33.710
All the time

24:33.752 --> 24:37.002
Does it ever puzzle you

24:37.044 --> 24:40.752
Have you asked why you seem

24:40.794 --> 24:43.127
To fall in love

24:43.169 --> 24:45.294
And out again

24:45.335 --> 24:49.129
Do you really ever love

24:49.171 --> 24:50.837
Or just pretend

24:50.879 --> 24:52.302
Hobby

24:52.337 --> 24:55.302
Why fool yourself?

24:55.337 --> 24:58.969
Don't be afraid
to help yourself

24:59.004 --> 25:02.005
Now these are very
silly little boots, Jones.

25:02.047 --> 25:05.630
And this is a very
silly little dress.

25:05.672 --> 25:07.255
And...

25:07.297 --> 25:09.845
these are...

25:09.880 --> 25:12.713
fuck me,
absolutely enormous panties.

25:12.755 --> 25:14.338
Jesus. Fuck.

25:14.505 --> 25:16.505
No, no, don't apologize.
I like them.

25:16.547 --> 25:19.130
Hello, Mummy.

25:19.172 --> 25:22.380
Love

25:22.547 --> 25:23.880
I'm sorry, I have to have
another look.

25:23.922 --> 25:25.713
- They're too good to be true.
- No.

25:25.755 --> 25:27.005
There's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

25:27.040 --> 25:28.255
I'm wearing something
quite similar myself.

25:28.297 --> 25:31.881
- Here, I'll show you.
- No. No.

25:31.923 --> 25:33.339
This time decide

25:33.589 --> 25:37.006
That you will open up

25:37.048 --> 25:39.513
Let it in

25:39.548 --> 25:42.339
There's no shame
in sharin' love

25:42.548 --> 25:46.133
You feel within

25:46.175 --> 25:48.841
So jump right in

25:48.883 --> 25:51.633
Head over heels

25:51.675 --> 25:53.675
And fall right in

25:55.008 --> 25:56.216
That was fantastic.

25:59.884 --> 26:01.634
Ohh. Daniel.

26:01.717 --> 26:02.842
Yeah?

26:02.884 --> 26:05.342
What happens at the office?

26:05.551 --> 26:07.342
Oh. Well,
I'm glad you asked that.

26:07.509 --> 26:10.217
You see,
it's a publishing house.

26:10.259 --> 26:12.259
So that means that people
write things for us...

26:12.294 --> 26:13.842
and then we print out
all the pages...

26:13.927 --> 26:15.135
and fasten them together...

26:15.177 --> 26:17.052
and make them into what
we call a book, Jones.

26:17.093 --> 26:21.635
No, do you think
people will notice?

26:21.677 --> 26:22.802
Notice what?

26:22.843 --> 26:25.968
Us. Working together,
sleeping together.

26:26.010 --> 26:27.177
Hang on a minute, Jones.

26:27.218 --> 26:30.553
Just slow down.
It started on Tuesday...

26:30.594 --> 26:32.136
and now it's Thursday.

26:32.178 --> 26:34.178
It's not exactly...

26:34.219 --> 26:37.011
um, a long-term relationship,
is it?

26:37.053 --> 26:40.636
You're very bad.

26:50.888 --> 26:52.846
Bridget Jones,
wanton sex goddess...

26:52.888 --> 26:56.680
with a very bad man
between her thighs.

26:56.721 --> 26:58.937
Mum. Hi.

26:58.972 --> 27:01.146
It's the truth
universally acknowledged...

27:01.181 --> 27:04.806
that the moment one area
of your life starts going OK...

27:04.847 --> 27:08.931
another part of it falls
spectacularly to pieces.

27:08.972 --> 27:11.097
Ah, anyone else want
to have it off?

27:11.299 --> 27:12.972
Don't be shy, madame.

27:13.014 --> 27:19.972
French. Have it oeuf.
With the wisecrack egg peeler.

27:20.007 --> 27:22.847
Now, nice firm grip.

27:24.181 --> 27:27.015
Put it in the hole. And...

27:27.050 --> 27:29.557
up, down, up, down.

27:29.598 --> 27:31.598
And off it comes in your hand.

27:32.890 --> 27:37.307
Oh! Mind the over-spray.
Sorry.

27:39.015 --> 27:40.934
Darling, if I came in
with my knickers on my head...

27:40.975 --> 27:42.350
he wouldn't notice.

27:42.517 --> 27:44.850
I spent thirty-five years
cleaning his house...

27:44.934 --> 27:47.142
washing his clothes,
bringing up his children.

27:47.184 --> 27:49.392
I'm your child, too.

27:49.600 --> 27:50.892
To be honest, darling,
having children...

27:50.927 --> 27:52.684
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

27:52.725 --> 27:55.185
Given my chance again,
I'm not sure I'd have any.

27:55.226 --> 27:57.643
And now it's
the winter of my life...

27:57.685 --> 27:59.893
and I haven't actually
got anything of my own.

27:59.935 --> 28:03.643
I've got no power,
no real career...

28:03.726 --> 28:05.935
no... no sex life.

28:05.976 --> 28:07.768
I've got no life at all.

28:07.810 --> 28:09.811
I'm like the grasshopper
who sang all summer.

28:09.894 --> 28:11.602
I'm like Germaine sodding Geer.

28:11.644 --> 28:13.067
Greer.

28:13.102 --> 28:16.727
Well, anyway, I'm not having it.
And I've been talent spotted.

28:16.769 --> 28:19.561
Julian thinks
I've got great potential.

28:19.602 --> 28:20.852
Who's Julian?

28:20.894 --> 28:22.811
From the Home Shopping Channel.

28:22.852 --> 28:24.853
Comes into the store
to have his colours done.

28:24.937 --> 28:26.645
Potential for what?

28:26.687 --> 28:29.103
As a demonstrator
on his cable show.

28:29.145 --> 28:30.812
You know, his assistant.

28:30.853 --> 28:33.145
Apparently, it's the highest-
rated show on the channel.

28:33.187 --> 28:34.520
Well, apart from the one...

28:34.562 --> 28:36.687
where the fat people
beat up their relatives.

28:36.722 --> 28:38.270
Ooh! I must wiz.

28:38.312 --> 28:41.689
- Have you heard from Mark Darcy?
- Good-bye, Mum.

28:44.189 --> 28:45.772
Mrs.

28:45.814 --> 28:49.147
Mrs. Jones

28:50.314 --> 28:51.897
Julian.

28:55.106 --> 28:57.690
Sorry to keep you waiting.

28:57.731 --> 29:03.155
Goin' on and on and on and on

29:03.190 --> 29:07.606
And a few weeks later,
it got lots worse.

29:07.648 --> 29:09.190
Hello!

29:09.231 --> 29:10.655
Look at this.

29:10.690 --> 29:12.981
Paying off
this heart-shaped pendant.

29:13.023 --> 29:15.981
One of my own personal
recommendations...

29:16.023 --> 29:18.856
is this absolutely stunning...

29:18.898 --> 29:21.315
matching necklace
and earring set.

29:21.356 --> 29:26.941
The earrings measuring
just over a centimetre...

29:27.024 --> 29:31.191
in genuine diamante with
two pairs in lapis lazuli...

29:31.232 --> 29:34.191
in a lovely mock-gold finish.

29:34.274 --> 29:37.193
The exact replica
of those worn at Wimbledon...

29:37.234 --> 29:41.359
in 1993 by Her Royal Highness
the Duchess of Kent.

29:43.568 --> 29:45.901
Well.

29:45.943 --> 29:48.026
Has she actually moved out then?

29:48.068 --> 29:51.902
Apparently, she and this
tangerine-tinted buffoon...

29:51.944 --> 29:53.159
are suddenly an item.

29:53.194 --> 29:56.194
Half our friends have had them
around to bloody dinner.

29:56.229 --> 29:58.819
She's even
taking Jaundice Julian...

29:58.860 --> 30:00.652
to Una Alconbury's
Tarts and Vicars party.

30:00.694 --> 30:03.152
That's not the Pamela I knew.
That's cruel.

30:03.194 --> 30:07.945
Well, still,
could be a golden opportunity.

30:07.986 --> 30:12.070
If you spent the entire party
flirting with other women...

30:12.111 --> 30:14.070
it would drive Mum
wild with jealousy.

30:14.111 --> 30:15.236
What?

30:15.278 --> 30:17.028
That's how I got my man.

30:17.070 --> 30:20.654
Have you got a boyfriend?
A real one?

30:20.689 --> 30:24.029
I have, Father. I have.

30:24.112 --> 30:27.029
And he's perfect.

30:45.573 --> 30:49.699
Hurrah.
Am no longer tragic spinster...

30:49.740 --> 30:53.199
but proper girlfriend
of bona fide sex god...

30:53.240 --> 30:55.324
so committed
that he's taking me...

30:55.365 --> 30:59.115
on a full-blown mini-break
holiday weekend.

30:59.157 --> 31:00.574
Just promise me
we don't have to sit...

31:00.615 --> 31:03.199
in any little boats and read
poncey poetry to each other.

31:03.240 --> 31:05.574
He’s also protecting
me at Uncle Geoffrey's...

31:05.615 --> 31:07.907
hideous Tarts and Vicars
fancy dress party.

31:07.949 --> 31:10.032
This can't be just shagging.

31:10.067 --> 31:12.115
A mini-break means true love.

31:13.990 --> 31:16.657
Suddenly feel like
screen goddess...

31:16.699 --> 31:19.658
in manner of Grace Kelly.

31:21.200 --> 31:25.200
Though perhaps ever so slightly
less elegant under pressure.

31:29.366 --> 31:32.993
It's very quiet here, isn't it?
Are we the only guests, or...

31:33.035 --> 31:34.952
We have a wedding this weekend.

31:34.993 --> 31:37.660
I believe there are just
four of you not involved.

31:39.868 --> 31:42.660
You do the boats,
I'll do the tea.

31:43.868 --> 31:45.077
Oh, Jesus.

31:45.118 --> 31:47.744
- Hello there.
- Hi.

31:47.786 --> 31:49.828
Well, well.

31:49.869 --> 31:52.911
I take it you're also heading
for the Alconbury's rockery.

31:52.953 --> 31:54.369
Yes, that’s right.

31:54.578 --> 31:57.869
I brought Natasha.
Get a bit of work done.

31:57.911 --> 32:00.953
Thought I might make it
a not entirely wasted weekend.

32:00.988 --> 32:02.870
How interesting.

32:02.912 --> 32:04.287
What a gripping life
you do lead.

32:04.329 --> 32:07.329
I'll see you
upstairs in a second.

32:21.996 --> 32:23.830
Hmm. Well, the weakness
of their case...

32:23.871 --> 32:26.705
Lies in the deposition
they made on August30.

32:26.740 --> 32:28.163
Season of mist...

32:28.205 --> 32:30.040
and...

32:30.082 --> 32:31.873
mellow fruitlessness.

32:31.915 --> 32:33.707
Oh, fuck me, I love Keats.

32:33.790 --> 32:35.207
Have you heard this one?

32:35.248 --> 32:37.332
"There was a young woman
from Ealing...

32:37.373 --> 32:40.248
"who had a peculiar feeling.

32:40.290 --> 32:43.040
"She lay on her back
and opened her crack...

32:43.123 --> 32:44.791
"and pissed
all over the ceiling. "

32:44.833 --> 32:45.958
Oh, bollocks.

32:45.999 --> 32:48.006
What've you done?

32:48.041 --> 32:50.958
- I'm boarding you, Bridge.
- Don't you dare!

32:50.999 --> 32:53.874
- I'm king of the world!
- No!

32:53.916 --> 32:56.083
Fuck me.

33:00.624 --> 33:02.291
Oh, piss and bollocks.

33:02.333 --> 33:04.124
You stupid ass.

33:06.666 --> 33:08.333
Bollocks.

33:08.374 --> 33:09.916
All right.

33:09.958 --> 33:11.645
Aah! No!

33:11.680 --> 33:13.333
So childish.

33:13.724 --> 33:15.625
No!

33:15.667 --> 33:17.084
Yes.

33:17.125 --> 33:19.292
Hey, Darce, come on in!

33:19.334 --> 33:21.167
The water's lovely!

33:21.209 --> 33:22.834
Come on, you're working
too hard, mate.

33:25.584 --> 33:28.551
- Daniel.
- Yes, Bridget?

33:28.586 --> 33:30.127
That thing you just did
is actually illegal...

33:30.169 --> 33:31.336
in several countries.

33:31.377 --> 33:33.211
Well, that is, of course,
the major reason...

33:33.252 --> 33:35.377
I'm so thrilled to be
living in Britain today.

33:35.586 --> 33:37.794
Yes. I can't understand...

33:37.836 --> 33:39.877
why the Prime Minister
doesn't mention it more...

33:39.919 --> 33:41.169
in his speeches.

33:41.211 --> 33:43.128
You should write
to him about it.

33:43.170 --> 33:44.378
I intend to.

33:47.795 --> 33:49.920
Daniel.

33:49.962 --> 33:51.045
Bridget.

33:51.087 --> 33:54.212
- Do you love me?
- Shut up, or I'll do it again.

33:56.337 --> 33:57.879
Do you love me?

33:57.921 --> 33:59.588
Right. You asked for it.

33:59.629 --> 34:02.879
And over we go.

34:02.921 --> 34:04.296
I'm going to give you
something to bite on.

34:04.338 --> 34:05.963
Here.

34:06.004 --> 34:08.379
OK? Pop this in your mouth,
darling.

34:10.754 --> 34:11.880
You're begging for it.

34:13.172 --> 34:14.797
Stop it.

34:17.839 --> 34:19.339
No, no.

34:28.216 --> 34:33.757
I got to go back to town.
A meeting's come up.

34:33.792 --> 34:35.174
On a Sunday?

34:35.216 --> 34:36.674
No. The meeting's
first thing tomorrow.

34:36.716 --> 34:38.674
I've got to work
on some figures.

34:38.716 --> 34:43.592
We could just pop
into the party for a minute.

34:43.632 --> 34:45.217
Bridget,
I'm really sorry.

34:45.257 --> 34:48.757
I just can’t do it.
I've got to head back.

34:48.800 --> 34:50.257
Listen, Daniel...

34:50.342 --> 34:53.717
if you've changed your mind,
you could just say so...

34:53.757 --> 34:56.092
because, honestly, I don't see
what could be so important.

34:56.132 --> 34:58.383
No, well, you wouldn't,
would you?

34:58.550 --> 35:00.258
Because you don't have
the faintest bloody idea...

35:00.300 --> 35:03.592
of just how much trouble
the company's in.

35:03.633 --> 35:05.050
You swan in
in your short skirt...

35:05.092 --> 35:07.008
and your sexy
see-through blouse...

35:07.050 --> 35:08.682
and fanny around
with press releases.

35:08.717 --> 35:10.176
You know, this is
the Americans flying in...

35:10.218 --> 35:11.843
because they're thinking
of shutting us down...

35:11.884 --> 35:13.259
for fuck's sake.

35:16.176 --> 35:17.926
Sorry.

35:19.926 --> 35:21.759
I'm sorry, Bridge.
I know I'm being a prat.

35:29.636 --> 35:31.636
Look, I'm going
to arrange a lovely car...

35:31.678 --> 35:33.345
to come and pick you up
and take you back...

35:33.386 --> 35:34.970
to London after the party, OK?

35:35.011 --> 35:37.095
If you have to travel alone,
travel in style.

35:39.221 --> 35:41.179
And...

35:41.221 --> 35:43.096
I also think
it's very important...

35:43.137 --> 35:46.346
that you win
this costume competition.

35:47.971 --> 35:49.179
Good.

35:49.221 --> 35:50.804
Good start.

35:52.680 --> 35:55.305
Now, then, Miss Jones,
where does this go?

35:58.638 --> 36:01.597
Oh, well, here we go.

36:01.638 --> 36:03.097
Trying hard
to fight off a vision...

36:03.138 --> 36:06.305
of Mum and Auntie Una
in fishnet tights.

36:06.347 --> 36:09.973
Seems unnatural, wrong even,
for60-year-olds to dress up...

36:10.014 --> 36:12.848
as prostitutes and priests
on a Sunday afternoon.

36:16.306 --> 36:18.014
Fly me to the moon

36:18.056 --> 36:20.056
Oh, holy Jesus.

36:21.389 --> 36:23.058
Bridget.

36:23.100 --> 36:24.995
Where are all the other
tarts and vicars?

36:25.030 --> 36:26.960
Oh, dear.
Didn't Geoffrey call you?

36:26.995 --> 36:28.891
Didn't you telephone
Colin and Bridget?

36:28.933 --> 36:30.808
How's my little Bridget?

36:30.850 --> 36:31.975
Bop, bop.

36:33.391 --> 36:34.683
Geoffrey.

36:34.725 --> 36:36.726
So, where’s this chap
of yours, then, eh?

36:36.767 --> 36:38.351
Ah, yes, well,
he had to work, so...

36:38.392 --> 36:40.351
Ha! A likely tale.

36:40.601 --> 36:42.184
Off they run. Whee!

36:44.059 --> 36:45.767
You are all long for

36:45.809 --> 36:49.017
Bizarre what some men
find attractive.

36:49.059 --> 36:51.142
Oh, God.

36:51.184 --> 36:53.726
Darling!
Geoffrey!

36:53.767 --> 36:55.309
What on earth are you wearing?

36:55.351 --> 36:57.309
You look like
a common prostitute.

36:57.351 --> 36:59.184
Yes, well, that was,
actually, the point.

36:59.226 --> 37:00.351
Say hi to Julian.

37:00.601 --> 37:02.642
Hello, Julian.

37:02.684 --> 37:03.892
My dear...

37:03.934 --> 37:06.018
you and your mother
could be sisters.

37:07.768 --> 37:09.352
And what a lovely bracelet.

37:09.393 --> 37:11.143
It's what I call
an all-arounder...

37:11.185 --> 37:14.102
the sort of thing one can wear
with anything to any occasion.

37:15.893 --> 37:17.727
Have you spoken to my dad?

37:17.768 --> 37:20.354
Yes. He's behaving
most bizarrely.

37:20.395 --> 37:21.937
I think he was actually
trying to flirt...

37:21.979 --> 37:24.354
with Penny Husbands-Bosworth,
poor thing.

37:24.395 --> 37:25.854
She was very frightened.

37:25.895 --> 37:27.687
She's only just had
her ovaries done.

37:32.770 --> 37:34.188
I don't know what
you ever saw in him.

37:34.230 --> 37:36.313
Shh. Bad man.

37:45.855 --> 37:47.896
Didn’t tell you, either.

37:50.814 --> 37:53.064
No. I didn't spend as much
as Bernard, thank God.

38:00.314 --> 38:01.696
I'm sorry, Dad.

38:01.731 --> 38:03.857
The way she looked at me.

38:04.940 --> 38:06.898
Well, she loves you, really.

38:06.933 --> 38:09.065
You love each other.

38:09.107 --> 38:10.398
This is only a temporary glitch.

38:10.607 --> 38:12.238
Is it?

38:12.273 --> 38:14.572
I don't know.

38:14.607 --> 38:16.648
I don't know.

38:19.942 --> 38:21.859
Ah, Bridget, there you are.

38:21.900 --> 38:23.192
Don’t worry.
You're not the only one.

38:23.234 --> 38:25.859
This is Penny. Geoffrey didn't
get in touch with her, either.

38:25.894 --> 38:27.025
I'm sorry?

38:27.067 --> 38:28.900
I was just saying Geoffrey
didn't contact you, either...

38:28.942 --> 38:30.359
to tell you that
the Tarts and Vicars concept...

38:30.609 --> 38:31.860
had gone out of the window.

38:31.901 --> 38:33.776
Oh, yes, he did.

38:33.818 --> 38:35.276
Oh, right.

38:35.311 --> 38:36.735
Lovely dress.

38:36.776 --> 38:38.318
Very exotic.

38:41.943 --> 38:43.735
What a shame you couldn't
bring your boyfriend, Bridget.

38:43.776 --> 38:45.151
What's his name?
David? Darren?

38:45.193 --> 38:46.651
Daniel Cleaver.

38:46.693 --> 38:48.401
Oh. Is he a friend
of yours, Mark?

38:48.610 --> 38:49.860
Absolutely not.

38:49.901 --> 38:52.276
I hope he's good enough
for our little Bridget.

38:52.318 --> 38:55.318
I think I can say with
total confidence absolutely not.

38:55.401 --> 38:57.235
Well, I'm sure he'd say
the same about you...

38:57.276 --> 38:58.985
given your past behaviour.

38:59.026 --> 39:00.360
Sorry?

39:00.401 --> 39:02.027
I think you know what I mean.

39:02.069 --> 39:03.194
Mark.

39:17.946 --> 39:19.196
Hmm.
Looks like Auntie Shirley...

39:19.238 --> 39:22.029
didn't get the message, either.

39:30.239 --> 39:31.405
Hi.

39:31.614 --> 39:35.864
I really, really wanted
to see a friendly face.

39:35.905 --> 39:37.655
Oh, now, listen,
I'll tell you what.

39:37.697 --> 39:40.579
I have an idea.
Let me finish this...

39:40.614 --> 39:42.155
while you go home,
have a long hot bath...

39:42.197 --> 39:45.781
and I'll call round,
and we'll have dinner later, OK?

39:48.698 --> 39:50.365
Is there someone here?

39:50.406 --> 39:52.698
Not that I'm aware of.

39:52.740 --> 39:54.656
Unless that Bosnian family
has moved in again.

39:54.698 --> 39:55.865
Bastards.

40:10.032 --> 40:11.824
I'm sorry.

40:11.866 --> 40:13.076
Sorry.

40:15.743 --> 40:17.083
I'm going mad.

40:17.118 --> 40:19.326
Listen, I am feeling
really bad, actually.

40:19.368 --> 40:21.326
- I should've been there today.
- No, I'm sorry.

40:21.368 --> 40:22.701
No, no, I'm sorry...

40:22.743 --> 40:24.743
but at least I got
a hell of a lot of work done.

40:24.778 --> 40:26.743
Just give me one more hour, OK?

40:26.778 --> 40:28.410
Fine. That’s fine.

40:28.452 --> 40:30.910
I will go home and de-bunny.

40:33.827 --> 40:38.077
and you know last night
when I said that I loved you?

40:39.369 --> 40:40.910
I didn't mean it.

40:40.952 --> 40:41.952
I was being ironic.

40:41.994 --> 40:45.785
Oh, God, yeah,
I know, I know.

40:45.827 --> 40:47.244
All right.

40:49.827 --> 40:51.827
Thank you, madam.

41:02.995 --> 41:06.036
Bridge.

41:06.078 --> 41:07.370
Bridget.

41:23.830 --> 41:27.831
This is Lara from
the New York office.

41:27.873 --> 41:29.956
Lara, this is Bridget.

41:29.998 --> 41:31.789
Hey, there.

41:34.706 --> 41:37.664
I thought you said she was thin.

42:27.919 --> 42:29.961
I was hoping that you
would want to be a part of it.

42:32.794 --> 42:34.419
This is totally insane.

42:34.628 --> 42:37.378
I'm 36years old. It may be
my last chance to have a child.

42:37.628 --> 42:38.794
Alex.

42:55.212 --> 42:59.712
The male penetrates
the female and leaves.

42:59.795 --> 43:02.754
Coitus is brief
and perfunctory...

43:02.795 --> 43:04.004
and the female...

43:07.422 --> 43:09.381
That's wonderful.

43:09.631 --> 43:11.131
Well, I don't think it's bad.

43:16.047 --> 43:17.214
Right.

43:32.757 --> 43:35.132
We've had
very good response...

43:35.173 --> 43:37.341
to the Teddy Knows Best
teaser campaign

43:37.383 --> 43:39.924
and had various
local radio bits for...

43:40.049 --> 43:41.424
Look, Bridge, stop that.

43:41.633 --> 43:44.924
I feel... terrible.

43:44.966 --> 43:46.924
The thing is...

43:46.966 --> 43:48.966
with Lara and me...

43:49.008 --> 43:51.342
well, you know...

43:51.384 --> 43:52.842
No. You'll have to fill me in.

43:52.925 --> 43:54.800
Well, the truth is...

43:54.842 --> 43:57.342
the truth is, we’re the same,
Bridge, you and me.

43:57.384 --> 43:59.342
You know? We're two people
of a certain age...

43:59.425 --> 44:03.050
looking for the moment to commit
and finding it really hard.

44:03.092 --> 44:04.344
And I just think
that in the end...

44:04.386 --> 44:07.677
it's got to be
something extraordinary...

44:07.719 --> 44:10.177
something which makes us
go that extra mile.

44:10.261 --> 44:11.427
And I think...

44:11.636 --> 44:13.761
Lara and...

44:13.844 --> 44:16.052
I don’t know,
being American and all...

44:16.094 --> 44:21.095
it has something to do
with confidence and being so...

44:21.137 --> 44:24.637
well, young, you know?

44:28.762 --> 44:32.012
Well, we’ve... become very close.

44:32.053 --> 44:35.637
Well, you’ve only just met her.
She flew in yesterday.

44:41.970 --> 44:43.887
Silly Bridget.

44:43.928 --> 44:46.012
You haven't only just met her.

44:46.053 --> 44:47.387
No.

44:47.428 --> 44:49.721
No. I got to know her
pretty well...

44:49.763 --> 44:51.971
when we were
in the New York office together.

44:54.888 --> 44:56.846
Oh, fuck.

44:56.888 --> 45:01.179
There's no easy way
to say this, but, um...

45:01.221 --> 45:06.181
I wanted you to be the first
to know that...

45:06.223 --> 45:08.181
we're engaged.

45:27.307 --> 45:29.682
At times like this...

45:29.724 --> 45:33.267
continuing with one's life
seems impossible...

45:33.308 --> 45:36.100
and eating the entire
contents of one's fridge...

45:36.135 --> 45:38.392
seems inevitable.

45:38.433 --> 45:41.017
I have two choices...

45:41.058 --> 45:45.017
to give up and accept permanent
state of spinster hood...

45:45.052 --> 45:48.976
and eventual eating by dogs...
or not.

45:50.143 --> 45:51.684
And this time, I choose not.

45:51.726 --> 45:53.393
I will not be defeated...

45:53.643 --> 45:57.226
by a bad man
and an American stick insect.

45:57.268 --> 46:00.311
Instead, I choose vodka...

46:01.728 --> 46:03.145
and Chaka Khan.

46:15.437 --> 46:18.229
I'm every woman

46:18.271 --> 46:21.354
It's all in me

46:21.396 --> 46:23.979
Anything you want done, baby

46:24.021 --> 46:25.896
I'll do it naturally

46:30.104 --> 46:33.187
I'm every woman

46:33.229 --> 46:36.354
It's all in me

46:36.396 --> 46:38.729
I can be the most right now

46:38.771 --> 46:40.146
Every girl from A to Z

46:48.813 --> 46:50.313
I can cast a spell

46:50.355 --> 46:51.737
Fuck.

46:51.772 --> 46:53.272
Of secrets you can't tell

46:53.307 --> 46:55.605
Mix a special groove

46:55.647 --> 46:57.940
Put fire inside of you

46:57.982 --> 47:00.024
Any time you feel danger...

47:00.149 --> 47:02.072
Why do you want
to be in television?

47:02.107 --> 47:06.065
Well, I've realized that
I've become deeply committed...

47:06.107 --> 47:07.899
to communicating
to the public...

47:07.940 --> 47:10.357
the up-to-the-moment
and in-depth news...

47:10.399 --> 47:12.274
both political and ecological.

47:12.316 --> 47:14.900
What do you think of
the El Niño phenomenon?

47:14.941 --> 47:17.691
Um... it's a blip.

47:17.733 --> 47:20.733
I think, basically,
Latin music is on its way out.

47:22.275 --> 47:23.816
So, why do you want
to work in television?

47:23.858 --> 47:25.941
Because I'm
passionately committed...

47:25.983 --> 47:27.859
to communicating with children.

47:27.901 --> 47:29.151
They are the future.

47:29.192 --> 47:31.151
Do you have any children
of your own?

47:31.186 --> 47:32.776
Oh, Christ, no. Yuck!

47:35.942 --> 47:37.234
Sorry.

47:37.276 --> 47:39.859
So, why do you want
to work in television?

47:39.901 --> 47:43.277
I've got to leave my current job
because I've shagged my boss.

47:43.318 --> 47:45.152
Fair enough.
Start on Monday.

47:45.193 --> 47:46.735
We'll see how we go.

47:46.770 --> 47:48.193
Oh, and...

47:48.235 --> 47:49.950
incidentally...

47:49.985 --> 47:51.402
at "Sit Up, Britain"...

47:51.443 --> 47:54.318
no one ever gets sacked
for shagging the boss.

47:54.360 --> 47:56.154
That's a matter of principle.

48:00.779 --> 48:02.237
Oh, Bridget.

48:02.279 --> 48:04.029
Come on, it's...

48:04.070 --> 48:05.654
I mean, I know it's been
awkward as ass...

48:05.695 --> 48:07.112
but there's no need to leave.

48:07.154 --> 48:09.119
No, actually, there is.

48:09.154 --> 48:11.988
I've been offered
a job in television.

48:12.030 --> 48:13.446
Television?

48:13.655 --> 48:16.863
Mmm. And they want me
to start straightaway.

48:16.905 --> 48:20.821
So I've got to leave
in about, ooh, three minutes...

48:20.856 --> 48:22.821
so...

48:24.780 --> 48:27.738
Whoa. Just hold it
right there, Miss Jones.

48:27.821 --> 48:29.030
I'm sorry to inform you...

48:29.071 --> 48:31.030
but I think you'll find
that by contract...

48:31.113 --> 48:33.155
you're expected to give
at least six weeks notice.

48:33.196 --> 48:34.821
Ah, yes, well...

48:34.863 --> 48:37.113
I thought with the company being
in so much trouble and all...

48:37.196 --> 48:38.446
you wouldn't really miss...

48:38.488 --> 48:41.031
the person who waltzes in
in a see-through top...

48:41.072 --> 48:43.322
and fannies about
with the press releases.

48:44.947 --> 48:46.281
Bridget.

48:46.322 --> 48:49.322
I want to hear this,
because if she gives one inch...

48:49.364 --> 48:51.031
I'm going to fire
her bony little bottom anyway...

48:51.072 --> 48:53.699
for being totally spineless.

48:53.741 --> 48:54.998
What?

48:55.033 --> 48:58.241
Well, I just think
you should know that, um...

48:58.283 --> 49:01.116
there are lots of prospects
here for a talented person.

49:01.151 --> 49:02.324
Just give me a minute,
will you, Simon? Thanks.

49:02.366 --> 49:03.949
Right-o, boss man.

49:05.199 --> 49:09.409
Lots of prospects
for a person who...

49:09.659 --> 49:11.325
you know, perhaps
for personal reasons...

49:11.367 --> 49:15.284
has been slightly
overlooked professionally.

49:15.325 --> 49:18.284
Thank you, Daniel.
That is very good to know...

49:18.325 --> 49:19.659
but if staying here...

49:19.700 --> 49:22.200
means working
within 10 yards of you...

49:22.242 --> 49:26.076
frankly, I'd rather have a job
wiping Saddam Hussein's ass.

49:26.111 --> 49:27.743
R-E-S-P-E-C-T

49:27.785 --> 49:29.910
Find out
what it means to me

49:29.945 --> 49:31.826
R-E-S-P-E-C-T

49:31.868 --> 49:33.285
Takin' care of T.C.B

49:33.326 --> 49:36.951
Sock it to me,
sock it to me

49:36.986 --> 49:38.917
Well, bye, everyone.

49:38.952 --> 49:42.202
Just a little bit

49:42.244 --> 49:43.786
I get tired

49:43.827 --> 49:45.411
But keep on tryin'

49:45.452 --> 49:47.119
You're runnin' out of fools

49:48.286 --> 49:49.744
Oh, just sod off.

49:49.911 --> 49:52.163
Hello and welcome
to "Sit Up, Britain. "

49:52.246 --> 49:55.454
OK, everybody,
it is bonfire night...

49:55.663 --> 49:57.253
and we are on fire.

49:57.288 --> 49:59.246
We have live
fire station feeds...

49:59.288 --> 50:03.746
from Newcastle, Swansea,
Sheffield, and Lewisham...

50:03.788 --> 50:05.454
just poised for tragedy.

50:05.621 --> 50:07.830
Bridget Jones, where are you?

50:09.747 --> 50:10.914
I'm here, Richard.

50:10.997 --> 50:13.122
Put on some more makeup.
I want you on-camera.

50:13.164 --> 50:14.289
But...

50:14.330 --> 50:16.122
I'm thinking... miniskirt.

50:16.157 --> 50:17.914
I'm thinking fireman's helmet.

50:17.955 --> 50:19.747
I want you pointing a hose.

50:19.872 --> 50:21.129
I want you
sliding down the pole...

50:21.164 --> 50:22.747
and then go straight
into the interview.

50:22.789 --> 50:24.997
Great.

50:25.039 --> 50:26.789
I'll do it.

50:28.997 --> 50:30.518
No problem. Fine. Right.

50:30.553 --> 50:32.004
So, you drop into shot...

50:32.039 --> 50:33.164
and then interview
Chief Fireman Bevan.

50:33.205 --> 50:35.040
Yep, yep, yep.

50:35.081 --> 50:36.290
Go, go. Go, go. Go!

50:36.331 --> 50:37.915
Go?

50:37.998 --> 50:41.165
Oh, no.
We're going to Newcastle first.

50:41.206 --> 50:42.790
Stop!

50:42.831 --> 50:44.165
Climb back up.

50:44.206 --> 50:45.331
On you in thirty seconds.

50:45.373 --> 50:47.123
OK.

50:49.333 --> 50:51.917
Neville, what
the fuck is going on?

50:51.958 --> 50:53.208
She's supposed to be
sliding down the pole...

50:53.250 --> 50:55.417
- not climbing up it.
- Go, go, go, go, go!

50:55.458 --> 50:56.917
Oh, OK.

50:58.258 --> 51:00.125
Oh, Jesus Christ.

51:02.708 --> 51:03.708
OK, we're out of time.
We're out of time.

51:03.751 --> 51:05.174
Just wind 'er up.

51:05.209 --> 51:08.501
Well, that seems to be
about all we've got time for...

51:08.709 --> 51:10.334
down here in Lewisham.

51:10.376 --> 51:14.168
Uh, Chief Officer Bevan,
thank you very much.

51:14.209 --> 51:16.001
Excellent fire station.

51:16.043 --> 51:17.966
Uh, and now...

51:18.001 --> 51:20.294
back to the studio.

51:27.294 --> 51:29.960
Excellent.
I'm a national laughing stock.

51:30.002 --> 51:32.210
Have bottom the size of Brazil.

51:32.252 --> 51:33.836
Am daughter of broken home...

51:33.878 --> 51:35.336
and rubbish
at every thing and...

51:35.420 --> 51:36.753
oh, God.

51:36.795 --> 51:39.385
I'm having dinner
with Magda and Jeremy.

51:39.420 --> 51:42.336
The only thing worse
than a smug married couple...

51:42.371 --> 51:45.253
Lots of smug married couples.

51:45.295 --> 51:47.880
Right, everyone.
This is Bridget.

51:49.297 --> 51:50.880
Bridge, this is Hugo and Jane.

51:50.922 --> 51:52.422
And, obviously,
you know, of course...

51:52.463 --> 51:53.838
Cosmo and Woney.

51:53.880 --> 51:55.088
- Hi, Bridge.
- Hi, Bridge.

51:55.130 --> 51:57.797
This is
Alistair and Henrietta...

51:57.838 --> 51:59.005
Julia and Michael...

51:59.047 --> 52:00.130
Joanne and Paul...

52:00.172 --> 52:01.971
and Jeremy's partners
from chambers.

52:02.006 --> 52:04.881
This is Natasha Glenville
and Mark Darcy.

52:04.923 --> 52:06.006
Hi, there.

52:06.048 --> 52:07.423
Hello.

52:07.464 --> 52:09.423
Not in your bunny girl
outfit to day?

52:09.464 --> 52:10.798
No.

52:10.839 --> 52:15.464
We bunnies only wear our tails
on very special occasions.

52:15.499 --> 52:17.798
- Sit yourself down.
- Right.

52:20.923 --> 52:23.964
Hey, Bridge,
how's your love life?

52:25.381 --> 52:27.839
Still going out
with that publishing chappie?

52:27.881 --> 52:30.173
Uh, no, no.

52:30.214 --> 52:31.465
Terribly brill.

52:31.632 --> 52:34.340
Never dip your nib
in the office ink.

52:34.382 --> 52:35.840
Right.

52:35.882 --> 52:37.132
You really
ought to hurry up...

52:37.174 --> 52:39.715
and get sprugged up,
you know, old girl?

52:39.757 --> 52:43.299
Time's a-running out.
Tick-tock.

52:43.340 --> 52:45.342
Yes, yes.

52:45.384 --> 52:47.842
Uh, tell me, is it
one in four marriages...

52:47.884 --> 52:49.884
that ends in divorce now
or one in three?

52:49.919 --> 52:51.134
One in three.

52:52.134 --> 52:53.426
Seriously, though.

52:53.467 --> 52:57.301
Offices full of single girls
in their thirties...

52:57.342 --> 52:59.259
fine physical specimens...

52:59.301 --> 53:02.427
but they just can't seem
to hold down a chap.

53:02.468 --> 53:03.933
Yes. Why is it...

53:03.968 --> 53:05.968
there are so many unmarried
women in their thirties...

53:06.003 --> 53:07.093
these days, Bridget?

53:13.135 --> 53:15.303
Oh, I don't know.

53:15.344 --> 53:18.386
Suppose it doesn't help
that underneath our clothes...

53:18.428 --> 53:20.969
our entire bodies
are covered in scales.

53:33.845 --> 53:35.012
I very much enjoyed...

53:35.054 --> 53:39.012
your Lewisham fire report,
by the way.

53:39.047 --> 53:40.470
Thank you.

53:44.056 --> 53:46.097
I just...

53:46.139 --> 53:47.764
yeah, well.

53:49.306 --> 53:50.764
So.

53:51.806 --> 53:53.139
It didn’t work out
with Daniel Cleaver?

53:53.181 --> 53:55.306
No, it didn't.

53:56.806 --> 53:58.098
I'm delighted to hear it.

53:59.682 --> 54:02.848
Look, are you and Cosmo
in this together?

54:02.890 --> 54:04.397
I mean, you seem
to go out of your way...

54:04.432 --> 54:06.765
to try to make me feel
like a complete idiot...

54:06.807 --> 54:11.640
every time I see you,
and you really needn't bother.

54:11.682 --> 54:16.057
I already feel like an idiot
most of the time anyway...

54:16.098 --> 54:18.807
with or without
a fireman's pole.

54:21.348 --> 54:22.848
That'll be my taxi.

54:22.883 --> 54:25.265
Good night.

54:25.307 --> 54:26.814
Look...

54:26.849 --> 54:29.808
I'm sorry if I've been...

54:29.933 --> 54:31.099
What?

54:31.141 --> 54:35.058
I don't think
you're an idiot at all.

54:35.099 --> 54:39.099
I mean, there are elements
of the ridiculous about you.

54:39.141 --> 54:41.351
Your mother's
pretty interesting.

54:41.386 --> 54:42.685
And you really are...

54:42.726 --> 54:44.726
an appallingly bad
public speaker.

54:44.768 --> 54:47.018
And you tend to let
whatever's in your head...

54:47.060 --> 54:48.351
come out of your mouth...

54:48.393 --> 54:51.726
without much consideration
of the consequences.

54:51.768 --> 54:55.060
I realize that when I met you
at the turkey curry buffet...

54:55.101 --> 54:59.936
that I was unforgivably rude
and wearing a reindeer jumper...

54:59.977 --> 55:02.227
that my mother had
given me the day before.

55:03.477 --> 55:05.477
But the thing is...

55:05.686 --> 55:10.187
what I'm trying to say
very inarticulately is...

55:11.687 --> 55:13.270
that...

55:13.353 --> 55:15.020
in fact...

55:15.062 --> 55:18.312
perhaps, despite appearances...

55:18.353 --> 55:21.103
I like you very much.

55:21.145 --> 55:24.354
Ah. A part from the smoking
and the drinking...

55:24.396 --> 55:27.229
and the vulgar mother
and the verbal diarrhea.

55:27.271 --> 55:31.229
No. I like you very much...
just as you are.

55:32.896 --> 55:36.479
Mark, we really are making
progress on the case in here.

55:36.688 --> 55:40.481
Jeremy’s had
the most brilliant idea.

55:40.690 --> 55:43.731
Right.

55:46.315 --> 55:48.481
I must go, because...

55:50.231 --> 55:52.231
well...

55:52.315 --> 55:53.941
bye.

55:54.066 --> 55:57.316
Someone exactly like you

56:01.357 --> 56:05.941
I've been travelin'
all around the world

56:06.066 --> 56:08.941
Just as you are?

56:08.982 --> 56:10.399
Not thinner? Not cleverer?

56:10.482 --> 56:13.732
Not with slightly bigger breasts
and a slightly smaller nose?

56:13.774 --> 56:15.274
Someone like you

56:16.816 --> 56:19.857
To make it all worth while

56:19.899 --> 56:21.983
Well...

56:22.025 --> 56:23.442
fuck me.

56:23.483 --> 56:25.150
Keep me satisfied

56:25.192 --> 56:27.442
Someone exactly like you

56:27.483 --> 56:29.192
But this is someone you hate,
right?

56:31.150 --> 56:33.275
Yes, yes. I hate him.

56:36.902 --> 56:39.735
I've been travelling a hard road

56:39.777 --> 56:43.985
November 9.
Weight... 138 pounds.

56:44.027 --> 56:45.819
Cigarettes... three.

56:45.860 --> 56:48.069
Birthday... thirty-three.

56:49.360 --> 56:51.910
OK, Bridget, see if you can
get it right this time.

56:51.945 --> 56:55.111
The verdict in the Aghani-Heaney
case is expected today.

56:55.153 --> 56:56.153
Get yourself down
to the high court.

56:56.195 --> 56:59.820
I want a hard-headed interview.

56:59.861 --> 57:01.695
You do know
the Aghani-Heaney case?

57:01.730 --> 57:04.695
Yes, of course.

57:04.736 --> 57:06.821
Big case...

57:06.862 --> 57:10.071
featuring someone
called Aghanihini.

57:10.154 --> 57:14.029
Or two people called
Kafir Aghani and Eleanor Heaney.

57:14.071 --> 57:16.786
That's the one.

57:16.821 --> 57:19.905
She's a British aid worker.
He's a Kurdish freedom fighter.

57:19.947 --> 57:21.863
The government
want to extradite him home...

57:21.905 --> 57:23.488
where he'll certainly
be executed.

57:23.655 --> 57:24.947
She's married to him...

57:24.988 --> 57:26.738
and they fought for five years
to keep him here.

57:26.822 --> 57:28.155
Today is the decision.

57:28.197 --> 57:29.703
Oh, that's exciting.

57:29.738 --> 57:33.447
Yes, it is...
so what are you waiting for?

57:33.488 --> 57:36.789
Am suddenly
hard-headed journalist...

57:36.824 --> 57:39.907
ruthlessly committed to
promoting justice and liberty.

57:39.949 --> 57:42.115
Nothing can distract me
from my dedication...

57:42.157 --> 57:44.157
to the pursuit of truth.

57:44.199 --> 57:46.782
Well, almost nothing.

57:46.865 --> 57:49.908
Right. I'll just pop
to the shop for some ciggies.

57:49.950 --> 57:54.075
14p for the Polos
and packet of Wheat Crunchies.

57:54.116 --> 57:55.290
Packet of Embassy, please.

57:55.325 --> 57:57.116
I'm sorry.
I'm not quite fine...

57:57.158 --> 57:58.991
Good afternoon.

58:01.200 --> 58:02.366
Hi.

58:03.491 --> 58:05.366
You like me just the way I am.

58:05.450 --> 58:06.866
Sorry?

58:06.908 --> 58:09.116
Nothing.

58:09.158 --> 58:11.325
Bridget,
we've fucked up utterly.

58:11.366 --> 58:14.075
Eleanor Heaney and Kafir Aghani
have come and gone.

58:14.116 --> 58:17.408
Oh, God. I'll be sacked.

58:17.450 --> 58:18.742
Did the others get interviews?

58:18.784 --> 58:20.617
I don't know.
I was having a slash.

58:20.652 --> 58:22.451
Actually, nobody got interviews.

58:22.492 --> 58:23.784
How do you know?

58:23.826 --> 58:24.909
Because I was defending him...

58:24.951 --> 58:27.076
and I told him
not to give any interviews.

58:28.117 --> 58:30.076
Look...

58:30.117 --> 58:32.328
I have a plan.

58:32.369 --> 58:34.036
And action.

58:36.078 --> 58:39.369
Mr. Darcy,
you were defending Mr. Aghani.

58:39.404 --> 58:41.453
You must be delighted.

58:41.494 --> 58:44.161
Yes, well, Kafir Aghani
has spent his entire life...

58:44.203 --> 58:45.453
defending
the basic human rights...

58:45.494 --> 58:47.245
of his own people,
and today's verdict...

58:47.287 --> 58:49.245
has been the result
of five years of struggle...

58:49.280 --> 58:51.127
by this woman, Eleanor Heaney...

58:51.162 --> 58:54.704
to save the man she loves
from an extradition order...

58:54.745 --> 58:58.287
that would've been tantamount
to a death sentence.

58:58.329 --> 58:59.787
Right.

58:59.829 --> 59:02.795
And, Eleanor, over to you.

59:02.830 --> 59:05.913
Did you fancy Kafir
the first time that you saw him?

59:08.788 --> 59:11.830
This has been Bridget Jones
for "Sit Up, Britain"...

59:11.871 --> 59:16.372
with, let’s face it,
a bit of a crush now, actually.

59:16.414 --> 59:17.914
Good afternoon.

59:17.956 --> 59:21.997
Bridget Jones...
already a legend.

59:22.164 --> 59:23.997
I feel fantastic, bombastic

59:24.039 --> 59:26.164
Ecstatically astounded

59:26.206 --> 59:29.331
Got a girl
who can really use her brain

59:29.366 --> 59:31.833
I feel surrounded, confounded

59:31.874 --> 59:34.374
Emotionally dumb founded

59:34.416 --> 59:38.416
Oh, joy.
I am broadcasting genius.

59:38.458 --> 59:41.791
Celebrating by cooking birthday
feast for close friends.

59:41.833 --> 59:43.333
Have sneaking suspicion...

59:43.374 --> 59:46.250
am also something of a genius
in the kitchen as well.

59:46.292 --> 59:50.959
Tie flavour-enhancing leek
and celery together with string.

59:51.000 --> 59:52.375
Right.

59:52.410 --> 59:53.715
String.

59:53.750 --> 59:55.292
String, string, string.

59:55.334 --> 59:57.299
Perfect.

59:57.334 --> 59:58.875
I don't think so

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.875
Finely slice oranges
and grate zest.

01:00:04.917 --> 01:00:06.875
Why don't you leave it there?

01:00:06.917 --> 01:00:09.834
I feel fantastic,
bombastic, ecstatic...

01:00:09.999 --> 01:00:11.125
Oh, bugger!

01:00:11.167 --> 01:00:12.125
Oh, bugger, bugger!

01:00:13.793 --> 01:00:16.168
I feel surrounded, confounded

01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:17.293
Emotionally dumbfounded

01:00:17.335 --> 01:00:19.383
Where the fuck
is the fucking tuna?

01:00:19.418 --> 01:00:22.251
Oh, this is Bridget Jones
for "Sit Up, Britain"...

01:00:22.293 --> 01:00:23.751
searching for tuna.

01:00:28.212 --> 01:00:29.503
Bridget Jones.

01:00:29.538 --> 01:00:30.795
Hello, darling.

01:00:30.878 --> 01:00:32.045
Hi, Mum.

01:00:32.087 --> 01:00:35.087
I just wanted a bit of a chat.

01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:37.503
Ouch!
Careful, you ham-fisted cunt!

01:00:37.712 --> 01:00:39.837
The thing is, darling, I'm...

01:00:39.878 --> 01:00:41.378
Between you and me,
I'm not entirely sure...

01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:43.379
that Julian
isn't a bit of a shit.

01:00:43.421 --> 01:00:44.386
Yes, well,
you know, Mum...

01:00:44.421 --> 01:00:46.379
I haven't really
got time right now.

01:00:46.421 --> 01:00:48.129
Oh, I...

01:00:48.171 --> 01:00:50.921
I can't deny the sex
is still very surprising.

01:00:50.963 --> 01:00:52.963
You know, the other night,
quite unexpectedly...

01:00:53.004 --> 01:00:55.171
I was just dozing off,
and I felt this huge...

01:00:55.213 --> 01:00:56.839
Bye, Mum.

01:00:58.255 --> 01:00:59.130
Ecch.

01:01:01.464 --> 01:01:03.755
Who can be calling now?

01:01:10.089 --> 01:01:11.423
The door was open.

01:01:11.465 --> 01:01:14.006
I came to congratulate...

01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:17.506
the new face
of British current affairs.

01:01:21.923 --> 01:01:26.383
But I see I may have come
at a bad time.

01:01:26.425 --> 01:01:28.258
How's it look?

01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:31.300
Great. It's, um... blue.

01:01:31.342 --> 01:01:33.175
Blue?

01:01:33.217 --> 01:01:34.758
No, but blue is good.

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:36.967
If you ask me,
there isn't enough blue food.

01:01:37.008 --> 01:01:40.008
Oh, shit.
It must've been the string.

01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:41.801
Oh, it's string soup?

01:01:43.009 --> 01:01:44.926
Oh, God. They're going
to be here any minute.

01:01:44.968 --> 01:01:46.509
Well, don't worry. I'm sure
they've come to see you...

01:01:46.718 --> 01:01:50.759
and not orange parfait
in sugar cages.

01:01:50.801 --> 01:01:52.051
Have a drink.

01:01:52.093 --> 01:01:53.218
Yes.

01:01:57.301 --> 01:01:58.301
Happy birthday.

01:01:58.343 --> 01:01:59.468
Thank you.

01:02:02.718 --> 01:02:05.134
Did I really run round
your lawn naked?

01:02:05.176 --> 01:02:06.843
Oh, yes.

01:02:06.884 --> 01:02:08.551
You were four, and I was eight.

01:02:08.718 --> 01:02:12.177
Well, that’s a pretty
big age difference.

01:02:13.219 --> 01:02:14.760
It's quite pervy, really.

01:02:14.802 --> 01:02:16.885
Yes, I like to think so.

01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:23.177
What are we going
to do about this dinner, then?

01:02:25.346 --> 01:02:30.304
We can have blue soup to start,
orange pudding to end, and...

01:02:30.346 --> 01:02:31.387
well, for main course,
we have...

01:02:31.429 --> 01:02:34.096
uh, congealed green gunge.

01:02:34.137 --> 01:02:38.180
- That is caper berry gravy.
- Oh, yes. Yeah.

01:02:38.222 --> 01:02:40.222
- Do you have eggs?
- Yes.

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:41.187
Right.

01:02:41.222 --> 01:02:42.847
Omelette it is, then.

01:02:42.888 --> 01:02:44.305
With caper berry gravy.

01:02:48.263 --> 01:02:52.723
You wouldn't by any chance
have any beet root cubes?

01:02:52.764 --> 01:02:55.764
A mini-gherkin, stuffed olive?

01:02:55.806 --> 01:02:58.348
No, Pam, and besides, I'm busy.

01:02:58.431 --> 01:03:00.431
The gravy needs sieving.

01:03:00.556 --> 01:03:02.348
Surely not. Just stir it, Una.

01:03:07.015 --> 01:03:09.202
In the dark

01:03:09.237 --> 01:03:11.390
I can hear

01:03:12.515 --> 01:03:14.807
Happy, happy birthday!

01:03:14.849 --> 01:03:17.224
Hey, TV queen.

01:03:17.265 --> 01:03:21.224
Hey, Bridge,
you looked fantastic.

01:03:23.892 --> 01:03:26.184
Hello.

01:03:26.226 --> 01:03:27.476
Are you joining us?

01:03:27.726 --> 01:03:30.024
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

01:03:30.059 --> 01:03:31.476
What did you say?

01:03:31.684 --> 01:03:35.017
It's OK

01:03:38.893 --> 01:03:40.727
Did you miss me?

01:03:49.227 --> 01:03:50.247
Excellent.

01:03:50.282 --> 01:03:51.268
Mmm. Yeah.

01:03:51.310 --> 01:03:53.227
Delicious.

01:03:53.268 --> 01:03:54.518
Really special.

01:03:54.768 --> 01:03:56.352
It's really... really very good.

01:03:56.393 --> 01:03:58.185
Really. It's very nice.

01:04:00.852 --> 01:04:01.893
Say...

01:04:03.268 --> 01:04:04.768
Mark,
why did your wife leave you?

01:04:04.853 --> 01:04:06.811
Mmm. Eat up.

01:04:06.853 --> 01:04:09.311
Eat up.
Two more lovely courses to go.

01:04:10.811 --> 01:04:13.853
Make it mine

01:04:13.894 --> 01:04:15.936
They can talk

01:04:15.978 --> 01:04:17.186
Mmm, delicious.

01:04:18.728 --> 01:04:20.771
I have to say, this really is
the most incredible shit.

01:04:24.688 --> 01:04:26.730
This is the worst of the three.

01:04:26.771 --> 01:04:28.521
It does actually
remind me of something.

01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:29.521
It tastes like...

01:04:29.730 --> 01:04:31.230
Marmalade.

01:04:31.271 --> 01:04:32.855
Well done, Bridge.

01:04:32.896 --> 01:04:35.981
Four hours of careful cooking
and a feast of blue soup...

01:04:36.022 --> 01:04:37.522
omelette, and marmalade.

01:04:37.564 --> 01:04:38.564
Thank you.

01:04:38.731 --> 01:04:40.022
I think that deserves a toast,
don’t you?

01:04:40.064 --> 01:04:41.189
To Bridget...

01:04:41.231 --> 01:04:44.397
who cannot cook,
but who we love...

01:04:44.439 --> 01:04:45.897
just as she is.

01:04:47.731 --> 01:04:48.982
To Bridget...

01:04:49.023 --> 01:04:51.482
just as she is.

01:04:51.523 --> 01:04:53.482
Did you miss me?

01:04:54.773 --> 01:04:56.732
Did you miss me?

01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:01.773
I'll go.

01:05:12.399 --> 01:05:13.691
Who?

01:05:14.941 --> 01:05:18.193
Ah. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:05:18.235 --> 01:05:21.985
I'm obviously interrupting a...

01:05:22.026 --> 01:05:24.318
Darcy.

01:05:24.401 --> 01:05:26.818
What brings you here?

01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:29.325
Oh, right. Yeah.

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:30.783
I should've guessed,
shouldn't I?

01:05:30.818 --> 01:05:33.819
Hi. I'm Tom. It's really good
to meet you at last.

01:05:33.861 --> 01:05:36.777
Yeah, listen,
I just came to...

01:05:36.819 --> 01:05:38.986
I thought
you might be on your own.

01:05:39.027 --> 01:05:41.152
Huh. What an idiot.

01:05:44.444 --> 01:05:45.486
Excuse me.

01:05:52.944 --> 01:05:54.902
I've been going crazy.

01:05:54.944 --> 01:05:56.986
I can't stop thinking
about you...

01:05:57.027 --> 01:06:00.111
and thinking
what a fucking idiot I've been.

01:06:00.152 --> 01:06:02.737
Christ, is that blue soup?

01:06:02.778 --> 01:06:04.452
Yes.

01:06:04.487 --> 01:06:06.528
That Sunday in the country...

01:06:08.903 --> 01:06:10.737
Come outside.

01:06:12.195 --> 01:06:15.072
It was all just going so fast...

01:06:15.114 --> 01:06:18.489
the hotel and that weekend,
meeting your parents.

01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:20.780
I just panicked.

01:06:20.822 --> 01:06:22.405
You know me. I'm...

01:06:22.447 --> 01:06:24.280
I'm a terrible disaster...

01:06:24.322 --> 01:06:27.197
with a posh voice
and a bad character.

01:06:27.239 --> 01:06:28.780
You're the only one
who can save me, Bridge.

01:06:28.822 --> 01:06:30.865
I need you. Without you,
twenty years from now...

01:06:30.906 --> 01:06:35.365
I'll be in some seedy bar
with some seedy blonde.

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:37.406
Well, what about Lara?

01:06:37.448 --> 01:06:40.531
Oh, over, over.
totally fucking finito.

01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:42.281
Dumped me.

01:06:42.323 --> 01:06:46.324
She realized
that I hadn't got over you.

01:06:46.366 --> 01:06:48.331
I know you're thinking...

01:06:48.366 --> 01:06:51.366
it's just a sex thing,
but I promise you...

01:06:51.407 --> 01:06:54.324
whenever I see that skimpy
little skirt on TV...

01:06:54.366 --> 01:06:55.824
I just close my eyes
and listen...

01:06:55.866 --> 01:06:58.199
to all the intelligent things
you've said.

01:06:58.282 --> 01:07:01.242
I was thrilled that little
Kurdish bloke was set free.

01:07:02.908 --> 01:07:04.158
Bridge...

01:07:05.408 --> 01:07:07.992
I missed you a lot.

01:07:11.075 --> 01:07:12.033
Oh, God.

01:07:12.075 --> 01:07:13.785
I'm going now. Bye.

01:07:14.869 --> 01:07:16.334
Mark, stay. We...

01:07:16.369 --> 01:07:17.827
No, I don't think I will.

01:07:17.869 --> 01:07:21.077
Well, listen,
don't leave on my behalf.

01:07:21.119 --> 01:07:26.285
I think it's time you and I
put this past behind us.

01:07:26.369 --> 01:07:27.870
At least stay
for a birthday drink...

01:07:27.911 --> 01:07:29.286
with me and Bridge, huh?

01:07:29.328 --> 01:07:31.411
Good-bye, Bridget.

01:07:33.286 --> 01:07:34.828
Mark.

01:07:40.495 --> 01:07:41.453
Why are you here?

01:07:41.495 --> 01:07:43.911
Bridge...

01:07:43.953 --> 01:07:46.536
I just told you why I'm here.

01:07:46.578 --> 01:07:49.578
Why was
Mark "Wanker" Darcy here?

01:07:49.745 --> 01:07:52.495
Oh, bloody hell.
Wait a minute. He's back.

01:07:52.536 --> 01:07:53.911
All right, Cleaver, outside.

01:07:53.953 --> 01:07:55.495
I'm sorry?

01:07:55.578 --> 01:07:57.121
Outside?

01:07:57.204 --> 01:08:00.954
Uh, should I bring
my duelling pistols or my sword?

01:08:04.371 --> 01:08:05.746
All right. Hang on.

01:08:15.039 --> 01:08:16.413
I should've done this years ago.

01:08:16.456 --> 01:08:18.538
Done what?

01:08:18.747 --> 01:08:19.712
This.

01:08:19.747 --> 01:08:21.913
Ooh! Fuck!

01:08:21.956 --> 01:08:23.831
Fuck me, that hurt!

01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:26.999
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.374
This.

01:08:28.415 --> 01:08:30.874
Aah! Oh, Christ, not again.

01:08:33.957 --> 01:08:35.124
Fight!

01:08:35.207 --> 01:08:37.040
What?

01:08:37.082 --> 01:08:39.005
Well, quick!

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.540
It's a real fight!

01:08:40.575 --> 01:08:42.041
It's a fight!

01:08:43.875 --> 01:08:45.207
All right,
all right, all right.

01:08:45.243 --> 01:08:46.500
I give up. I give up.

01:08:46.541 --> 01:08:48.291
Just give me a moment,
all right? Just...

01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:52.375
Let me get a moment's
break here, OK?

01:08:53.416 --> 01:08:55.334
Cheat!

01:08:55.376 --> 01:08:56.959
Cheat! Cheat!

01:09:05.084 --> 01:09:07.084
I should've knew it!

01:09:21.169 --> 01:09:22.461
Whose side are we on?

01:09:22.502 --> 01:09:23.754
Mark's, obviously.

01:09:23.795 --> 01:09:25.754
He's never dumped Bridget
for some naked American.

01:09:25.795 --> 01:09:27.795
And he said he liked her
just the way she is.

01:09:27.837 --> 01:09:29.587
Yeah, but he also shagged
Daniel's fiancée...

01:09:29.795 --> 01:09:30.587
and left him broken hearted.

01:09:30.795 --> 01:09:33.087
Good point.
It's a very hard one to call.

01:09:33.129 --> 01:09:35.879
It's raining men

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:38.149
Hallelujah, it's raining men

01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:41.962
Oh, yes!

01:09:44.545 --> 01:09:46.087
Mark!

01:09:46.129 --> 01:09:47.504
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry, all right?

01:09:51.129 --> 01:09:52.505
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

01:09:52.546 --> 01:09:54.130
I really am sorry.

01:09:54.171 --> 01:09:55.130
I... I will pay.

01:09:55.171 --> 01:09:56.796
Had enough, Darcy?

01:09:56.838 --> 01:09:59.380
Not quite,
if that's all right by you.

01:09:59.421 --> 01:10:01.838
Oh!
You broke my bloody jaw!

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:05.130
Happy birthday to you

01:10:05.171 --> 01:10:08.798
Happy birthday to you

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:13.382
Happy birthday,
dear what's-his-name

01:10:13.423 --> 01:10:18.465
Happy birthday to you

01:10:19.965 --> 01:10:21.966
It's raining men

01:10:22.049 --> 01:10:24.341
Hallelujah, it's raining men

01:10:31.758 --> 01:10:33.883
Jesus.

01:10:39.842 --> 01:10:41.092
All right.

01:10:41.134 --> 01:10:43.134
- All right?
- Enough.

01:10:43.217 --> 01:10:46.050
Enough.

01:10:46.092 --> 01:10:47.509
Wanker.

01:11:01.301 --> 01:11:03.135
What is your problem?

01:11:03.218 --> 01:11:05.012
- My problem?
- Yes.

01:11:05.053 --> 01:11:08.928
You give the impression
of being all moral and noble...

01:11:08.963 --> 01:11:10.345
and normal...

01:11:10.387 --> 01:11:12.387
and helpful in the kitchen...

01:11:12.428 --> 01:11:14.553
but you’re just as bad
as the rest of them.

01:11:14.803 --> 01:11:16.845
Well, I can see
that I've been labouring...

01:11:16.928 --> 01:11:19.388
under a misapprehension.

01:11:19.429 --> 01:11:24.096
A very, very foolish mistake.
Forgive me.

01:11:44.221 --> 01:11:47.013
Let's go back upstairs.

01:11:47.054 --> 01:11:48.514
Come on.

01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:53.514
We belong together, Jones.

01:11:54.972 --> 01:11:56.889
Me, you.

01:11:58.097 --> 01:11:59.972
Poor little skirt.

01:12:02.097 --> 01:12:04.141
Right.

01:12:04.182 --> 01:12:08.099
If I can't make it with you...

01:12:08.141 --> 01:12:10.932
I can't make it with anyone.

01:12:20.433 --> 01:12:24.808
That's not a good enough offer
for me.

01:12:24.850 --> 01:12:26.767
I'm not willing
to gamble my whole life...

01:12:26.808 --> 01:12:29.142
on someone who's...

01:12:29.177 --> 01:12:31.476
well, not quite sure.

01:12:32.976 --> 01:12:34.893
It's like you said.

01:12:34.976 --> 01:12:38.393
I'm still looking
for something...

01:12:38.434 --> 01:12:40.518
more extraordinary than that.

01:12:59.852 --> 01:13:01.562
Ding dong, merrily on high

01:13:01.771 --> 01:13:03.812
December 25.

01:13:03.896 --> 01:13:06.937
Weight... 140 pounds...

01:13:06.979 --> 01:13:08.562
Plus forty-two mince-pies.

01:13:08.771 --> 01:13:12.021
Alcohol units...

01:13:12.062 --> 01:13:13.062
Oh, thousands.

01:13:13.104 --> 01:13:14.855
Bugger off!

01:13:14.897 --> 01:13:16.522
Come on, kids.

01:13:18.397 --> 01:13:21.272
This baroque carriage clock...

01:13:21.313 --> 01:13:23.855
is a particular festive
favourite of mine...

01:13:23.897 --> 01:13:26.855
incorporating
the Hallelujah Chorus...

01:13:26.897 --> 01:13:28.355
from Handel's "Messiah"...

01:13:28.438 --> 01:13:31.105
every hour on the hour.

01:13:31.147 --> 01:13:32.188
I don't understand it.

01:13:32.230 --> 01:13:34.063
The man's actually
turned red now.

01:13:34.147 --> 01:13:36.063
Merry Christmas, Pamela.

01:13:42.063 --> 01:13:43.313
Well...

01:13:43.355 --> 01:13:45.523
I'm going to Bedfordshire.

01:13:52.564 --> 01:13:55.064
Night, night.

01:14:09.108 --> 01:14:10.900
The thing is...

01:14:12.025 --> 01:14:14.942
well, close up,
he was almost purple.

01:14:16.442 --> 01:14:19.984
You were such
a lovely normal colour.

01:14:20.067 --> 01:14:23.901
He had a filthy temper.

01:14:23.984 --> 01:14:26.588
And, well,
the jewellery is fabulous...

01:14:26.623 --> 01:14:29.193
and really very
reasonably priced and...

01:14:30.485 --> 01:14:33.485
I thought I might ask if...

01:14:35.527 --> 01:14:37.485
we could have another go.

01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:40.860
I mean, obviously,
with some effort on your part...

01:14:40.902 --> 01:14:42.986
to pay a bit more attention
to me.

01:14:43.028 --> 01:14:45.986
I do realize
what I'm like sometimes.

01:14:46.069 --> 01:14:47.278
It doesn't help
that you and Bridget...

01:14:47.319 --> 01:14:49.111
have your lovely
grownup club of two...

01:14:49.153 --> 01:14:50.444
and always saying...

01:14:50.528 --> 01:14:52.986
"What's silly old Mummy
gone and done this time?"

01:14:53.028 --> 01:14:56.363
You used to be mad about me.

01:14:56.405 --> 01:14:58.238
You couldn't get enough of me.

01:15:02.155 --> 01:15:03.821
What do you think?

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:09.155
I don't know, Pam.

01:15:11.489 --> 01:15:14.072
I just don't know now.

01:15:16.406 --> 01:15:18.072
It's been very hard.

01:15:18.114 --> 01:15:21.072
Oh, Colin.

01:15:24.906 --> 01:15:27.447
I'm joking, you daft cow.

01:15:32.072 --> 01:15:34.864
Pam,
I just don't work without you.

01:15:37.781 --> 01:15:40.323
Awful.

01:15:44.032 --> 01:15:46.990
Lovely, lovely, lovely.

01:15:47.032 --> 01:15:49.198
Get back up those stairs,
young lady.

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:50.448
Get dressed.

01:15:50.490 --> 01:15:51.823
What for?

01:15:51.865 --> 01:15:53.825
The Darcys' ruby wedding party.

01:15:53.867 --> 01:15:55.242
What for, indeed.

01:15:55.284 --> 01:15:57.909
Mark will be there...
still divorced.

01:15:57.950 --> 01:16:01.450
He's also still deranged.
I'm not going.

01:16:01.492 --> 01:16:04.367
Poor Mark. It's always
a bad time of year for him.

01:16:04.409 --> 01:16:06.492
You know, his Japanese wife
left him on Christmas Day.

01:16:06.575 --> 01:16:07.909
Cruel race.

01:16:07.950 --> 01:16:09.596
Yes, but I'm not quite sure...

01:16:09.631 --> 01:16:11.243
he didn’t deserve it, actually.

01:16:11.285 --> 01:16:13.160
She ran off with his best friend
from Cambridge.

01:16:13.201 --> 01:16:15.535
Total scoundrel, apparently.

01:16:15.576 --> 01:16:17.118
Best man at his wedding.

01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:19.243
Christmas Eve, Mark
comes home early from work...

01:16:19.285 --> 01:16:22.410
finds the pair of them
in a most unorthodox position...

01:16:22.451 --> 01:16:24.869
stark naked,
a tit like rabbits.

01:16:29.869 --> 01:16:32.161
Just give me five minutes.

01:16:32.202 --> 01:16:33.327
Ain't no mountain high enough

01:16:34.786 --> 01:16:35.994
Ain't no valley low enough

01:16:37.287 --> 01:16:39.245
Ain't no river wide enough

01:16:39.287 --> 01:16:42.245
Stop. Stop the car.
Stop the car.

01:16:42.287 --> 01:16:44.453
Dad, get out. Too slow!

01:16:44.495 --> 01:16:45.537
Ain't no valley low enough

01:16:45.578 --> 01:16:46.995
Say it again

01:16:47.037 --> 01:16:48.287
Ain't no river wide enough

01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:50.953
Hey, to keep me from you

01:16:50.988 --> 01:16:52.830
Dad, get in.

01:16:52.872 --> 01:16:54.039
- Hurry.
- What's your hurry?

01:16:56.122 --> 01:16:58.788
Not too fast.

01:16:58.823 --> 01:17:01.455
Keep me from you

01:17:07.581 --> 01:17:09.873
A bit snowy, isn't it?

01:17:09.915 --> 01:17:11.456
Ain't no mountain high enough

01:17:12.873 --> 01:17:14.415
Ain't no valley low enough

01:17:15.873 --> 01:17:17.831
Ain't no river wide enough

01:17:17.873 --> 01:17:20.123
To keep me from you

01:17:20.165 --> 01:17:21.915
Ain't no mountain high enough

01:17:21.956 --> 01:17:24.248
Ow, ain't no valley low enough

01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:25.540
Say it again

01:17:25.581 --> 01:17:26.956
Ain't no river wide enough

01:17:26.998 --> 01:17:29.456
Hey, to keep me from you

01:17:29.498 --> 01:17:31.790
Sorry. One moment.

01:17:34.581 --> 01:17:35.916
Thank you for inviting me.

01:17:35.957 --> 01:17:38.916
I didn't.
It must've been my parents.

01:17:43.416 --> 01:17:44.457
So...

01:17:44.499 --> 01:17:46.541
So.

01:17:48.124 --> 01:17:49.207
Hello, Bridget.

01:17:49.249 --> 01:17:50.834
Didn't know you were coming.

01:17:50.876 --> 01:17:54.834
Mark, your father
wants to begin A.S.A.P.

01:17:54.876 --> 01:17:56.376
Oh, does he? Right.

01:17:56.418 --> 01:17:57.793
Well...

01:17:57.834 --> 01:17:59.959
Come on, Mark.
Be helpful, please.

01:18:00.001 --> 01:18:01.793
The caterers
have totally screwed up.

01:18:01.834 --> 01:18:03.251
Does nothing work
outside of London?

01:18:03.293 --> 01:18:05.044
Hmm? Apparently not.

01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:08.044
Well, I'd better...

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:12.085
Listen...

01:18:12.127 --> 01:18:16.210
I owe you an apology
about Daniel.

01:18:17.919 --> 01:18:20.253
He said that you ran off
with his fiancée...

01:18:20.295 --> 01:18:22.878
and left him broken hearted,
he said.

01:18:25.211 --> 01:18:26.461
No, it was the other way around.

01:18:26.503 --> 01:18:30.003
It was my wife...

01:18:31.211 --> 01:18:32.837
my heart.

01:18:34.337 --> 01:18:36.379
Sorry.

01:18:36.421 --> 01:18:40.171
That's why you always acted
so strangely around him...

01:18:40.212 --> 01:18:44.879
and beat him to a pulp,
quite rightly.

01:18:44.921 --> 01:18:46.254
Well done.

01:18:47.298 --> 01:18:48.423
Well...

01:18:48.464 --> 01:18:50.548
Can we just...

01:18:50.589 --> 01:18:53.256
pop out there...

01:18:53.298 --> 01:18:54.839
for a moment?

01:18:57.256 --> 01:18:59.173
Quite delightful,
isn't it, my dear?

01:19:01.089 --> 01:19:02.590
OK.

01:19:04.424 --> 01:19:08.299
I just have something
that I want to say.

01:19:09.924 --> 01:19:12.132
You once said that you
liked me just as I am...

01:19:12.174 --> 01:19:17.090
and I just wanted to say...
likewise.

01:19:17.132 --> 01:19:19.090
I mean...

01:19:19.132 --> 01:19:21.257
there are stupid things
your mum buys you.

01:19:21.299 --> 01:19:22.965
Tonight's another classic.

01:19:23.007 --> 01:19:25.507
You're haughty, and you
always say the wrong thing...

01:19:25.549 --> 01:19:27.257
in every situation.

01:19:27.299 --> 01:19:30.465
And I seriously believe
that you should...

01:19:30.507 --> 01:19:32.550
rethink the length
of your sideburns.

01:19:34.425 --> 01:19:37.050
But you're a nice man...

01:19:37.091 --> 01:19:38.216
and...

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:41.841
I like you.

01:19:45.008 --> 01:19:46.968
So if you wanted
to pop by sometime...

01:19:47.010 --> 01:19:48.385
that might be nice.

01:19:51.927 --> 01:19:54.052
More than nice.

01:19:56.302 --> 01:19:57.343
Right.

01:19:59.302 --> 01:20:00.428
Crikey.

01:20:03.344 --> 01:20:05.178
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:20:05.219 --> 01:20:08.928
could I have your attention
for a moment, please?

01:20:08.969 --> 01:20:10.344
Excuse me.

01:20:13.969 --> 01:20:15.345
Of course.

01:20:15.387 --> 01:20:18.102
...wife and companion Geraldine.

01:20:18.137 --> 01:20:23.220
A toast to her,
my... my wonderful wife Geraldine.

01:20:23.262 --> 01:20:25.435
To Geraldine.

01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:27.179
And we, in turn...

01:20:27.220 --> 01:20:30.096
have been blessed
with our son, Mark.

01:20:30.138 --> 01:20:31.346
He's always made us proud...

01:20:31.388 --> 01:20:34.055
and we couldn't be
prouder of him...

01:20:34.096 --> 01:20:35.180
than on this particular day...

01:20:35.263 --> 01:20:37.888
because I'm thrilled
to announce...

01:20:37.930 --> 01:20:40.221
he has just been invited
to be a senior partner...

01:20:40.263 --> 01:20:42.346
in the firm of Abbott
and Abbott in New York.

01:20:46.890 --> 01:20:48.432
He also,
incidentally...

01:20:48.473 --> 01:20:50.557
takes with him his
brilliant partner in law...

01:20:50.598 --> 01:20:52.557
Natasha.

01:20:52.598 --> 01:20:54.598
And, well, I don't
think they'll mind...

01:20:54.807 --> 01:20:56.348
since we're amongst friends...

01:20:56.390 --> 01:21:01.016
if I say that someday
this remarkably clever girl...

01:21:01.058 --> 01:21:04.391
is going to be
something-else-in-law as well.

01:21:10.266 --> 01:21:12.016
I begged him
not to say anything.

01:21:12.058 --> 01:21:13.439
So I ask you now...

01:21:13.474 --> 01:21:15.558
to charge your glasses
once again...

01:21:15.599 --> 01:21:18.183
to Mark and his Natasha.

01:21:18.266 --> 01:21:20.599
To Mark and his Natasha.

01:21:20.641 --> 01:21:23.224
No! No!

01:21:27.309 --> 01:21:30.024
It's just that...

01:21:30.059 --> 01:21:32.475
it's such a terrible pity...

01:21:35.017 --> 01:21:38.350
f-for England...

01:21:38.392 --> 01:21:40.100
to lose...

01:21:40.142 --> 01:21:42.561
such a great legal brain.

01:21:42.602 --> 01:21:44.602
- Is she pissed?
- What?

01:21:44.811 --> 01:21:47.852
F-for the people of England...

01:21:49.436 --> 01:21:51.019
Like me and you...

01:21:51.061 --> 01:21:55.270
to lose one of our top people.

01:21:57.353 --> 01:22:00.853
just top person, really.

01:22:06.478 --> 01:22:09.312
Well... better dash.

01:22:09.353 --> 01:22:12.813
I've got
another party to go to.

01:22:12.848 --> 01:22:15.479
It's single people.

01:22:15.521 --> 01:22:18.271
Mainly... poofs.

01:22:21.604 --> 01:22:23.438
Bye.

01:22:38.230 --> 01:22:41.482
Knew the sight

01:22:41.524 --> 01:22:43.982
Wasn't right

01:22:44.017 --> 01:22:46.541
I was stupid

01:22:46.576 --> 01:22:49.066
For a while

01:22:49.149 --> 01:22:51.607
Swept away

01:22:51.816 --> 01:22:54.573
By you

01:22:54.608 --> 01:22:57.233
And now I feel

01:22:57.275 --> 01:22:59.900
Like a fool

01:23:01.567 --> 01:23:04.192
So confused

01:23:04.233 --> 01:23:06.900
My heart's bruised

01:23:06.942 --> 01:23:10.442
Was I ever loved by you?

01:23:10.483 --> 01:23:12.942
Out of reach

01:23:12.977 --> 01:23:15.858
So far

01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:21.067
I never had your heart

01:23:21.108 --> 01:23:23.568
Out of reach

01:23:23.609 --> 01:23:26.193
Couldn't see

01:23:26.234 --> 01:23:31.526
We were never meant to be

01:23:31.568 --> 01:23:34.234
Catch my self

01:23:34.276 --> 01:23:36.945
From the spell

01:23:36.986 --> 01:23:42.111
I could drown if I stay here

01:23:42.153 --> 01:23:44.236
Keepin' busy

01:23:44.278 --> 01:23:45.445
Every day

01:23:47.528 --> 01:23:51.071
I know I will be OK

01:23:51.112 --> 01:23:52.071
Yes?

01:23:52.112 --> 01:23:54.154
Hi, it's us!

01:23:56.571 --> 01:23:58.487
Great. Come on up.

01:24:00.487 --> 01:24:02.529
Have we got the most
fantastic surprise for you.

01:24:02.612 --> 01:24:03.994
Oh, no.
You're not going to sing.

01:24:04.029 --> 01:24:06.447
Not that fantastic, sadly, no,
but still pretty good.

01:24:06.488 --> 01:24:08.113
We've decided we're taking you
to Paris for the weekend.

01:24:08.155 --> 01:24:11.113
Forget everything... particularly,
forget about Mark Darcy.

01:24:11.155 --> 01:24:13.238
I can't believe you said
what you said you said.

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:14.578
I know.

01:24:14.613 --> 01:24:17.072
There goes my invite
to the Darcys' next year.

01:24:17.113 --> 01:24:18.822
If he didn't leap over
the family heirlooms...

01:24:18.863 --> 01:24:20.281
and whip you up in his arms,
then sod him.

01:24:20.323 --> 01:24:24.906
Yes. He's clearly
the most dreadful cold fish.

01:24:24.948 --> 01:24:26.489
Exactly.

01:24:26.531 --> 01:24:27.573
I mean, there’s been
all these bloody hints...

01:24:27.614 --> 01:24:29.406
and stuff,
but has he ever actually...

01:24:29.448 --> 01:24:31.114
stuck his fucking tongue
down your fucking throat?

01:24:31.156 --> 01:24:33.198
No. Not once.

01:24:33.239 --> 01:24:34.616
I think we should pack,
shouldn’t we?

01:24:34.658 --> 01:24:36.200
Passport, Bridget. And pants.

01:24:36.241 --> 01:24:37.658
Yep, pants.

01:24:37.825 --> 01:24:39.033
Hurry up, Bridge!

01:24:39.075 --> 01:24:40.908
We’re freezing our bollocks off
out here!

01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:43.116
Yeah. Just the keys.

01:24:44.158 --> 01:24:45.950
I'm stuck! Oh!

01:24:49.867 --> 01:24:51.367
Come the fuck on, Bridget.

01:24:53.034 --> 01:24:54.221
Close the door.

01:24:54.256 --> 01:24:55.409
Bridget?

01:24:55.451 --> 01:24:57.409
Stop being so bossy.

01:24:58.992 --> 01:25:01.034
What are you doing here?

01:25:01.076 --> 01:25:03.242
I just wanted to know
if you were available...

01:25:03.277 --> 01:25:04.492
for bar mitzvahs
and christenings...

01:25:04.534 --> 01:25:06.576
as well as ruby weddings.

01:25:06.826 --> 01:25:08.207
Excellent speech.

01:25:08.242 --> 01:25:10.326
I thought
that you were in America.

01:25:10.367 --> 01:25:13.867
Well, yes, I was,
but...

01:25:13.909 --> 01:25:16.451
I realized I'd forgotten
something back home.

01:25:17.617 --> 01:25:18.868
Which was?

01:25:19.993 --> 01:25:23.827
Well, I realized
I'd forgotten to...

01:25:25.077 --> 01:25:26.410
kiss you good-bye.
Do you mind?

01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:31.910
not really, no.

01:25:35.412 --> 01:25:37.079
So...

01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:39.870
you're not going
to America, then?

01:25:39.912 --> 01:25:41.412
- No.
- No.

01:25:41.454 --> 01:25:42.454
Not.

01:25:42.495 --> 01:25:44.579
You're staying here?

01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:46.579
So it would seem.

01:25:52.121 --> 01:25:53.205
Go, Bridget!

01:25:53.246 --> 01:25:54.205
Friends of yours?

01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:59.205
No. I've never seen them
before in my life.

01:25:59.246 --> 01:26:01.206
Look, are you coming
to fucking Paris or not?

01:26:02.956 --> 01:26:03.914
Not.

01:26:03.956 --> 01:26:06.039
- No fucking room anyway.
- No.

01:26:06.081 --> 01:26:08.456
Maybe we should just go upstairs
for a minute.

01:26:08.497 --> 01:26:10.581
Yes. Very good idea.

01:26:10.622 --> 01:26:13.039
No.
Come on, let's go. No.

01:26:13.081 --> 01:26:15.623
Of course she's not coming.

01:26:15.665 --> 01:26:17.290
Close it down.

01:26:22.873 --> 01:26:24.213
give me just a minute.

01:26:24.248 --> 01:26:27.123
Um... keep yourself busy.
Read something.

01:26:27.158 --> 01:26:30.558
Lots of very
high-quality magazines...

01:26:30.593 --> 01:26:33.959
with helpful fashion
and romance tips.

01:26:34.959 --> 01:26:37.375
I'll be right with you.

01:26:43.459 --> 01:26:48.793
Definitely an occasion
for genuinely tiny knickers.

01:27:18.919 --> 01:27:20.127
Right.

01:27:25.127 --> 01:27:26.377
Right.

01:27:33.088 --> 01:27:36.088
Mark?

01:27:40.338 --> 01:27:44.005
Mark!

01:27:52.380 --> 01:27:54.422
Oh, shit.

01:28:00.881 --> 01:28:02.465
Double shit.

01:28:12.132 --> 01:28:13.632
Bollocks!

01:28:13.841 --> 01:28:15.257
Oh, God.

01:28:20.841 --> 01:28:23.382
Ooh! Wish me luck!

01:28:23.424 --> 01:28:25.884
Good luck, crazy girl!

01:28:25.926 --> 01:28:27.259
Ain't no mountain high enough

01:28:27.501 --> 01:28:29.613
Ain't no valley low enough

01:28:29.848 --> 01:28:31.926
Ain't no river wide enough

01:28:32.209 --> 01:28:35.218
To keep me from you

01:28:35.301 --> 01:28:37.280
Ain't no mountain high enough

01:28:37.315 --> 01:28:39.259
Ow, ain't no valley low enough

01:28:39.301 --> 01:28:41.260
Say it again,
ain't no river wide enough

01:28:41.295 --> 01:28:44.892
Hey, to keep me from you

01:28:44.927 --> 01:28:48.969
Ain't no mountain high enough

01:28:49.010 --> 01:28:51.010
Nothing can keep me

01:28:51.052 --> 01:28:52.225
Mark?

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:54.135
Keep me from you

01:28:56.635 --> 01:28:58.010
Mark!

01:29:00.177 --> 01:29:02.260
Oh, damn.

01:29:03.844 --> 01:29:05.135
Ain't no mountain high enough

01:29:05.177 --> 01:29:07.594
No, ain't no valley low enough

01:29:07.844 --> 01:29:10.303
I am so sorry.

01:29:10.345 --> 01:29:11.595
I'm so sorry.

01:29:11.845 --> 01:29:13.470
I didn't mean it.

01:29:13.511 --> 01:29:15.136
I mean, I meant it...

01:29:15.178 --> 01:29:20.303
but I was so stupid
that I didn't mean what I meant.

01:29:23.553 --> 01:29:25.930
Oh, for Christ's sakes.

01:29:28.638 --> 01:29:30.638
It's only a diary.

01:29:32.013 --> 01:29:35.305
Everyone knows diaries
are just full of crap.

01:29:39.014 --> 01:29:40.473
I know that.

01:29:40.514 --> 01:29:42.848
I was just buying you a new one.

01:29:42.889 --> 01:29:44.389
Time to make a new start,
perhaps.

01:30:02.015 --> 01:30:03.140
I've been searching' a long time

01:30:06.474 --> 01:30:10.850
For someone exactly like you

01:30:14.475 --> 01:30:18.391
I've been travelling
all around the world

01:30:21.141 --> 01:30:22.977
Waitin' for you

01:30:23.018 --> 01:30:24.268
To come through

01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:29.185
Someone like you

01:30:29.227 --> 01:30:30.185
Will make it all worthwhile

01:30:30.227 --> 01:30:31.602
Wait a minute.

01:30:32.643 --> 01:30:35.268
Nice boys don't kiss like that.

01:30:35.310 --> 01:30:36.853
Oh, yes, they fucking do.

01:30:36.894 --> 01:30:38.193
Keep me satisfied

01:30:38.228 --> 01:30:42.103
Someone exactly like you

01:30:45.561 --> 01:30:48.561
Someone exactly like you

01:30:52.436 --> 01:30:56.061
Someone exactly like you

01:31:00.478 --> 01:31:02.936
The best is yet to come

01:31:06.104 --> 01:31:09.104
The best is yet to come

01:31:23.439 --> 01:31:27.022
Have you met Miss Jones?

01:31:27.064 --> 01:31:30.606
Someone said as we shook hands

01:31:30.647 --> 01:31:34.482
She was just Miss Jones

01:31:34.523 --> 01:31:37.273
To me

01:31:39.107 --> 01:31:42.065
And now I've met Miss Jones

01:31:43.357 --> 01:31:46.107
And we'll keep on meeting

01:31:46.142 --> 01:31:48.812
Till we're done

01:31:48.847 --> 01:31:51.483
Miss Jones and I

01:31:53.941 --> 01:31:55.274
Whoa, fellas

01:32:24.111 --> 01:32:26.236
And all at once

01:32:26.319 --> 01:32:28.152
I lost my breath

01:32:28.194 --> 01:32:30.236
And all at once

01:32:30.277 --> 01:32:32.237
Was scared to death

01:32:32.278 --> 01:32:33.987
And all at once

01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:37.153
I owned the earth

01:32:37.195 --> 01:32:39.362
And sky

01:32:41.487 --> 01:32:45.570
Now I've met Miss Jones

01:32:45.612 --> 01:32:48.695
And we'll keep on meeting

01:32:48.903 --> 01:32:51.903
Till we're done

01:32:51.945 --> 01:32:54.278
Miss Jones and I

01:32:55.945 --> 01:32:58.237
Miss Jones and I

01:32:59.653 --> 01:33:07.363
Miss Jones and I

01:33:11.154 --> 01:33:12.904
How!

01:33:12.946 --> 01:33:16.323
I didn't
mean to hurt your feelings

01:33:16.365 --> 01:33:18.573
It was so careless of me

01:33:20.573 --> 01:33:23.865
I guess I've gone and done it

01:33:23.906 --> 01:33:26.115
It's just a matter of time

01:33:27.573 --> 01:33:29.323
Nothing I can do

01:33:29.365 --> 01:33:31.581
But tell you I'm sorry

01:33:31.616 --> 01:33:38.657
And that's the hardest part
of all

01:33:38.907 --> 01:33:46.408
'Cause your love’s
the killin' kind

01:33:46.450 --> 01:33:54.408
Your love's the killin’ kind

01:33:54.450 --> 01:33:56.575
Yeah

01:33:56.617 --> 01:33:59.159
I'd rather walk on glass

01:33:59.201 --> 01:34:04.368
Than see teardrops in your eyes

01:34:04.409 --> 01:34:06.618
And I'd fall to pieces

01:34:06.868 --> 01:34:08.576
Just to hold you

01:34:08.618 --> 01:34:11.243
The best thing in my life

01:34:11.284 --> 01:34:15.411
And it's just luck
I get to love you

01:34:15.453 --> 01:34:19.036
You're the one thing
that's right

01:34:19.078 --> 01:34:23.078
You're the light
in my hell's darkness

01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:30.579
'Cause your love’s
the killin’ kind

01:34:30.621 --> 01:34:38.496
Your love's the killin’ kind

01:34:38.537 --> 01:34:40.287
Oh, yeah

01:34:42.037 --> 01:34:44.079
I just might cry now

01:34:44.121 --> 01:34:45.579
Lie

01:34:45.621 --> 01:34:47.871
Lay down and die now

01:34:49.329 --> 01:34:51.537
You've done it to me

01:34:53.037 --> 01:34:57.413
You're puttin' me under

01:34:57.455 --> 01:34:59.872
I close my eyes at night

01:34:59.913 --> 01:35:02.128
Sittin' under sky

01:35:02.163 --> 01:35:05.330
I love you and all is pleasures

01:35:05.372 --> 01:35:07.122
Baby, feels so right

01:35:07.163 --> 01:35:12.165
My arms won't be
of any use at all

01:35:12.207 --> 01:35:16.540
If I can't hold you

01:35:16.582 --> 01:35:24.290
'Cause your love's
the killin’ kind

01:35:24.325 --> 01:35:28.291
Your love's the killin’ kind

01:35:36.666 --> 01:35:40.417
Not of this earth

01:35:42.209 --> 01:35:45.542
You've changed places
with the sun

01:35:48.167 --> 01:35:50.917
I know that you're the one

01:35:53.376 --> 01:35:56.002
I love what we've become

01:35:58.293 --> 01:36:02.460
Not of this earth

01:36:04.002 --> 01:36:07.168
Not surprised we're unashamed

01:36:09.212 --> 01:36:12.379
She's gonna have
to change her name

01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:17.420
Then we'll know
they'll be the same

01:36:19.962 --> 01:36:24.338
She's not of this earth

01:36:24.380 --> 01:36:30.088
And I believe
we've seen the worst

01:36:30.130 --> 01:36:33.963
If I ever leave this world

01:36:35.463 --> 01:36:37.546
You will have a song to sing

01:36:37.588 --> 01:36:41.046
So you know what you're worth
