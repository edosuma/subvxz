WEBVTT

00:03.006 --> 00:06.675
Okay. Our special holiday family and
friends night is coming up Christmas Eve,

00:06.677 --> 00:10.779
and we think it would be really fun to
perform a song we all write together.

00:10.781 --> 00:13.215
So let's throw out words that
make us think of Christmas.

00:13.217 --> 00:14.282
Anybody?

00:15.485 --> 00:17.219
Christmas!

00:18.822 --> 00:22.724
Okay, Herman, the word Christmas
does make me think of Christmas.

00:22.726 --> 00:24.626
Uh, anybody else?

00:26.629 --> 00:27.863
Christmas.

00:29.332 --> 00:30.966
Yeah, Dez, that's
already on the list.

00:30.968 --> 00:32.000
Aw.

00:32.002 --> 00:33.301
What about something
like mistletoe?

00:33.303 --> 00:34.469
Or sleigh bells.

00:34.471 --> 00:36.338
Or presents.

00:36.340 --> 00:39.941
More specifically, the cheetah print
handbag I emailed you all about.

00:40.910 --> 00:42.511
Several times.

00:42.513 --> 00:43.879
Anybody else?

00:45.381 --> 00:48.083
Lily, you're awfully quiet.

00:48.085 --> 00:50.419
What word comes to your mind
when you think of Christmas?

00:51.354 --> 00:52.421
Lousy.

00:53.322 --> 00:54.723
Lousy?

00:54.725 --> 00:57.325
That doesn't sound very
Christmassy to me.

00:57.327 --> 00:59.995
Well, maybe she meant lousy
as in lousy the reindeer?

01:01.030 --> 01:02.731
There's no reindeer named lousy.

01:02.733 --> 01:05.000
She's right. It's drowsy.

01:05.001 --> 01:07.035
There's no reindeer
named drowsy either.

01:07.037 --> 01:10.072
Oh, yeah. I'm thinking
of the dwarves.

01:10.074 --> 01:11.773
You know, goldilocks
and the three dwarves.

01:11.775 --> 01:13.241
Lousy, drowsy, and Jim.

01:14.410 --> 01:16.411
Guys, we're trying to
write a song here.

01:16.413 --> 01:20.449
Christmas is about happiness and
being with the people you love.

01:20.451 --> 01:22.851
Yeah, Lily. Why would
you say it's lousy?

01:23.786 --> 01:26.254
I just think Christmas
is overrated.

01:26.256 --> 01:30.158
People make too big of a deal out of
it, and it's really not that great.

01:31.094 --> 01:32.160
It's lousy.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.074

01:45.274 --> 01:46.641
I think Lily's on to something.

02:49.205 --> 02:50.972
I'm so excited to see Santa!

02:50.974 --> 02:52.507
Oh, there he is!

02:52.509 --> 02:53.608
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

02:53.610 --> 02:55.210
Merry Christmas!

02:55.966 --> 02:57.646
I can't wait to get my
picture with Santa.

02:57.648 --> 03:01.016
I've been posing in the same outfit every
year since I was three months old.

03:05.488 --> 03:08.056
Guess who got promoted
as Santa's head elf?

03:08.058 --> 03:09.991
You got promoted?

03:09.993 --> 03:12.260
What? It's Christmas,
not April fool's day.

03:13.529 --> 03:14.396
It's true.

03:14.398 --> 03:17.499
Ever since gumdrop quit, Santa had
no choice but to give me the job.

03:17.501 --> 03:19.367
Oh, what's your elf name?

03:19.369 --> 03:20.869
Jingletoes.

03:24.907 --> 03:28.009
Hey, kids, you're not supposed
to eat the candy canes!

03:28.011 --> 03:29.477
They're styrofoam!

03:29.479 --> 03:30.612
Ah, what do I care?

03:31.647 --> 03:33.315
I want to work for Santa.

03:33.317 --> 03:35.250
I bet I would be
great at elfing!

03:35.252 --> 03:36.318
Me too.

03:37.354 --> 03:38.887
Do you think Santa
would hire us?

03:38.889 --> 03:41.022
I can whittle toys from wood.
See?

03:41.024 --> 03:43.091
What the heck is that?

03:43.093 --> 03:44.893
A choo-choo train.

03:44.895 --> 03:47.028
Choo-choo! Chugga chugga chugga.

03:47.030 --> 03:48.830
Ah! Splinter.

03:49.999 --> 03:51.533
Fine, you're hired.

03:51.535 --> 03:54.369
But you have to do whatever
the head elf says.

03:54.371 --> 03:57.572
Even if it seems ridiculous and
completely unrelated to the job.

03:58.609 --> 04:00.075
Yes!

04:00.077 --> 04:03.111
Okay, twerps. Santa's got
some jobs for you to do.

04:03.113 --> 04:05.113
Gingerbread, put the head
back on the snowman.

04:07.250 --> 04:08.917
Marshmallow, go
make me a sandwich.

04:08.919 --> 04:11.586
I'm on it! I'm great
at making sandwiches.

04:13.456 --> 04:14.623
He's not.

04:16.185 --> 04:18.426
If you need me, I'll be in the
sleigh listening to music.

04:18.428 --> 04:20.262
Aren't you supposed
to be taking photos?

04:20.264 --> 04:21.796
Sorry, can't hear you!

04:32.108 --> 04:34.442
Hey, Santa! I'm gingerbread.

04:34.444 --> 04:37.245
You can call me ginger,
or bread, or gingerbread.

04:37.247 --> 04:40.782
Well, it is very nice to
meet you, gingerbread.

04:42.551 --> 04:45.587
I just want to say how happy
I am to join the team.

04:45.589 --> 04:47.422
Here, I whittled you this.

04:47.424 --> 04:49.624
Oh! What a beautiful...

04:49.626 --> 04:51.493
Uh... um...

04:51.495 --> 04:52.560
It's a choo-choo train.

04:52.562 --> 04:53.628
Oh.

04:58.168 --> 05:01.469
Okay, when Lily gets here we need
to get her in the holiday spirit.

05:01.471 --> 05:03.905
It's weird that she's not
more excited about Christmas.

05:03.907 --> 05:06.007
Yeah.

05:06.009 --> 05:07.381
I've seen that girl get
excited over getting

05:07.393 --> 05:08.777
a curly fry mixed in
with her regular fries.

05:08.779 --> 05:10.645
She talked about it for a month.

05:11.981 --> 05:14.683
Trish, shouldn't you be working
at the north pole right now?

05:15.651 --> 05:17.619
Please, I've got nothing
to worry about.

05:17.621 --> 05:19.321
I'm Santa's head elf.

05:20.790 --> 05:23.091
Guess who just got promoted
to Santa's head elf?

05:23.993 --> 05:26.294
What the holly are
you talking about?

05:26.296 --> 05:27.862
Santa and I have
gotten really close.

05:27.864 --> 05:30.632
When it comes to Christmas,
we share the same vision.

05:30.634 --> 05:32.434
And also, you weren't there.

05:33.369 --> 05:34.436
Wait.

05:34.438 --> 05:36.604
So does this mean
you're my boss now?

05:38.007 --> 05:39.974
Just so you know, I'm
gonna be late today.

05:39.976 --> 05:41.009
And everyday.

05:41.011 --> 05:42.544
Hi, guys.

05:42.546 --> 05:43.611
Lily!

05:43.613 --> 05:45.447
I am so glad you're here.

05:45.449 --> 05:50.051
Before we start your lesson, let's
do something fun and Christmassy.

05:50.053 --> 05:51.619
No, that's okay.

05:51.621 --> 05:54.656
Come on! Wanna help us bake
some cookies for Santa?

05:54.658 --> 05:55.690
No, thanks.

05:55.692 --> 05:57.025
Good call.

05:57.027 --> 05:59.107
Santa's doing that whole
no-carb thing till the 24th.

06:00.629 --> 06:01.343
Well...

06:01.374 --> 06:04.199
What if we cut up some carrots
for Santa's reindeer?

06:04.201 --> 06:05.667
I don't think so.

06:05.669 --> 06:07.235
Ugh. I wouldn't do that.

06:07.237 --> 06:08.737
Carrots give the reindeer gas.

06:08.739 --> 06:10.338
Especially Rudolph.

06:10.340 --> 06:12.860
They always sing about his shiny
nose but never his stinky butt.

06:13.476 --> 06:14.809
Dez, you're not helping.

06:14.811 --> 06:16.177
It's okay.

06:16.179 --> 06:19.013
Can we just have our lesson
and play something that's not

06:19.015 --> 06:20.915
the Christmas song
we've been writing?

06:21.917 --> 06:22.984
No!

06:22.986 --> 06:24.706
We need to get you in
the Christmas spirit.

06:25.521 --> 06:28.156
And I know just the jolly
fat man to cheer you up.

06:28.158 --> 06:29.758
Oh, good idea.

06:29.760 --> 06:31.326
My Uncle Joe is great with kids.

06:32.261 --> 06:34.696
No, Dez. She's obviously
talking about Santa.

06:34.698 --> 06:36.664
Oh, that makes more sense.

06:36.666 --> 06:38.666
My Uncle Joe's gonna be
pretty disappointed.

06:39.769 --> 06:40.835
Hey.

06:46.675 --> 06:47.709
Ho, ho, ho!

06:47.711 --> 06:52.247
Oh, little girl, now tell Santa
what would you like for Christmas?

06:52.249 --> 06:53.748
Nothing.

06:53.750 --> 06:56.084
Come now. Everybody
wants something.

06:56.086 --> 06:58.520
Yeah, like a cheetah
print handbag.

06:58.522 --> 07:00.922
Heh. Yes, yes, we
get it, jingletoes.

07:00.924 --> 07:02.590
We all saw the email.

07:03.959 --> 07:05.994
But right now we are
talking about Lily.

07:07.062 --> 07:08.363
Well...

07:08.365 --> 07:10.732
There is something I want,

07:10.734 --> 07:12.767
but there's no way you
can get it for me.

07:12.769 --> 07:15.370
Santa can get you
anything, Lily.

07:15.372 --> 07:16.971
Yeah, tell him what you want.

07:17.907 --> 07:19.307
Fine.

07:19.309 --> 07:22.410
All I want for Christmas is
for my dad to come home,

07:22.412 --> 07:26.481
but he's volunteering in Ecuador,
so that's not going to happen.

07:26.483 --> 07:28.716
I wish we could just
skip Christmas.

07:34.557 --> 07:36.158
Think she wants an
eight by ten of this?

07:37.326 --> 07:38.393
No?

07:45.836 --> 07:47.569
I feel terrible about Lily.

07:48.271 --> 07:50.472
I can't believe her dad isn't
coming home for Christmas.

07:50.474 --> 07:51.739
Guys, don't worry.

07:51.741 --> 07:53.675
I know how to make
her feel better.

07:53.677 --> 07:55.243
Gingerbread's got this.

07:57.346 --> 07:58.167
Hey, Lily.

07:58.198 --> 08:01.449
What you asked Santa for
is a really tough order.

08:01.451 --> 08:04.819
Yeah, but that doesn't mean it
can't still be a great Christmas.

08:04.821 --> 08:05.987
And we can still have fun.

08:05.989 --> 08:10.091
Right. So what you
need to understand is

08:10.093 --> 08:12.494
Santa will definitely get
your dad home for Christmas.

08:12.496 --> 08:13.528
Really?

08:13.530 --> 08:14.596
Really?

08:15.531 --> 08:17.866
Yeah. I'm Santa's
right-hand man now,

08:17.868 --> 08:19.801
and together we can
make anything happen.

08:19.803 --> 08:21.135
Oh my gosh!

08:21.137 --> 08:22.770
Thank you, gingerbread!

08:22.772 --> 08:25.707
This is gonna be the
best Christmas ever!

08:31.647 --> 08:32.679
Dez!

08:32.682 --> 08:34.782
What did you do? You
can't promise her that.

08:34.784 --> 08:38.453
I said I'd make her feel
better, and I did. Whoo!

08:43.192 --> 08:46.661
I'm so excited my dad's gonna be
here for family and friends night!

08:46.663 --> 08:48.296
I'm gonna make him an ornament.

08:49.473 --> 08:52.033
Are you sure you don't want something
more special for Christmas?

08:52.035 --> 08:53.902
Something money can buy?

08:53.904 --> 08:56.170
Like a yacht?

08:56.172 --> 08:58.506
No, I really just want my dad.

08:58.508 --> 09:00.642
That's what'll make it
the perfect Christmas!

09:00.644 --> 09:01.743
Oh!

09:01.745 --> 09:03.311
That's a good idea for our song.

09:03.313 --> 09:04.712
Perfect Christmas.

09:04.714 --> 09:06.180
Yeah.

09:06.182 --> 09:07.215
Perfect.

09:07.217 --> 09:10.451
Hey, Austin. Can I
talk to you for a sec?

09:14.023 --> 09:16.324
Guess who just saved Christmas?

09:16.326 --> 09:18.026
Pack your bags, we're
going to Ecuador.

09:18.028 --> 09:20.295
Oh, I've never been to Canada.

09:21.697 --> 09:22.997
Ecuador is in South America.

09:23.933 --> 09:25.867
I know.

09:25.869 --> 09:27.769
I'm just saying I've
never been to Canada.

09:29.104 --> 09:33.675
We're going to the physicians without
fences base where Lily's dad volunteers.

09:33.677 --> 09:38.813
In Ecuador, which as everyone
knows is in South America.

09:39.782 --> 09:40.848
Right.

09:40.850 --> 09:44.953
Anyway, I realized that there
are a lot of doctors there

09:44.955 --> 09:47.355
who are missing their families
and need cheering up.

09:47.357 --> 09:52.260
So I arranged for us to do a special
holiday performance for all of them.

09:52.262 --> 09:55.263
So we're gonna be in South
America for Christmas?

09:55.265 --> 09:56.631
How does that help Lily?

09:56.633 --> 09:58.866
No! No! We'll be home
before Christmas.

09:58.868 --> 10:01.069
I worked it out so
that after we perform,

10:01.071 --> 10:03.304
we get to bring Lily's
dad home with us.

10:04.554 --> 10:06.874
Do you think my dad would like
pink glitter on his ornament

10:06.876 --> 10:08.576
or hot pink glitter?

10:08.578 --> 10:10.945
What grown man doesn't
like hot pink glitter?

10:10.947 --> 10:11.980
Oh, great.

10:11.982 --> 10:13.381
Because I made you this.

10:14.650 --> 10:15.717
Oh!

10:15.719 --> 10:17.118
A headband.

10:17.120 --> 10:19.654
A hot pink glittery headband.

10:19.656 --> 10:20.989
Thank you.

10:22.057 --> 10:23.124
Put it on.

10:32.969 --> 10:34.769
Twinkles, more bells!

10:34.771 --> 10:36.304
Tinsel, more cheer!

10:37.674 --> 10:38.840
Elf up, tinsel.

10:38.842 --> 10:40.875
There's no crying
in Santa's village.

10:41.810 --> 10:44.779
Marshmallow, those candy cane
socks need to be knee high!

10:44.781 --> 10:45.847
Pull them up!

10:45.849 --> 10:48.116
Or I'll throw you in the brig!

10:48.118 --> 10:49.984
You mean the gingerbread house?

10:50.919 --> 10:51.986
Just pull them up.

10:54.256 --> 10:56.024
Where's Jingletoes?

11:02.699 --> 11:04.265
On your feet, snow maggot!

11:05.467 --> 11:09.337
Sheesh. Ever since you got promoted,
you've been acting like a drill sergeant.

11:09.339 --> 11:11.372
How would you know? All
you've done is sleep.

11:11.374 --> 11:13.875
Yeah, but your constant
yelling keeps waking me up.

11:14.810 --> 11:16.978
Santa's work is
serious business.

11:16.980 --> 11:20.114
We have t-minus 24 hours
until operation Christmas.

11:20.116 --> 11:21.315
Now hustle up.

11:21.317 --> 11:23.151
I need you to scrape the gum
off the candy cane fence

11:23.153 --> 11:24.393
and clean up the reindeer poop.

11:25.220 --> 11:26.454
We don't have a reindeer.

11:26.456 --> 11:28.823
Oh. Well, something
pooped back there.

11:28.825 --> 11:29.924
So clean it up!

11:30.859 --> 11:32.060
I'll get right on that.

11:32.961 --> 11:33.995
Oh!

11:33.997 --> 11:35.463
I think I hear
Santa calling you.

11:35.465 --> 11:36.898
You better hurry.

11:36.900 --> 11:38.700
It might be an "elf-mergency."

11:38.702 --> 11:40.468
Great giggling gumdrops!

11:40.470 --> 11:41.536
I'm coming Santa.

11:44.039 --> 11:45.039
All right, elves.

11:45.041 --> 11:46.874
Gingerbread has gone too far.

11:46.876 --> 11:48.342
And I am sick of it!

11:48.344 --> 11:51.312
Yeah! He said he's gonna put
me on Santa's naughty list

11:51.314 --> 11:54.248
just 'cause I handed out
non-regulation candy canes.

11:55.317 --> 11:57.452
Time for this
gingerbread to crumble.

12:06.995 --> 12:08.029
Oh, good.

12:08.031 --> 12:09.063
You made it.

12:09.065 --> 12:10.631
It was just a quick
five hour flight.

12:11.667 --> 12:14.569
And a four hour ride
on a chicken truck.

12:14.571 --> 12:17.872
Then a hike for three hours
-through the jungle. -Yeah.

12:17.874 --> 12:20.508
And then we canoed
down a ten mile river.

12:20.510 --> 12:23.044
Well, the important
thing is you're here.

12:23.046 --> 12:25.012
I'm Dr. salt, the
charity coordinator.

12:25.014 --> 12:26.247
We spoke on the phone.

12:26.249 --> 12:28.616
Hey, is that a chicken
bone in your hair?

12:28.618 --> 12:30.151
Probably.

12:36.291 --> 12:38.259
How is it that we took
the exact same trip

12:38.261 --> 12:40.461
and you look like that
and I look like this?

12:41.363 --> 12:43.397
You fell into that
swamp and I didn't.

12:43.399 --> 12:44.160
- Yeah.
- Plus...

12:44.191 --> 12:46.664
That howler monkey really
took a liking to you.

12:47.936 --> 12:49.537
So, are you ready to start?

12:49.539 --> 12:51.072
I know I am.

12:51.074 --> 12:51.841
Oh! Oh!

12:51.872 --> 12:54.909
I was hoping you could
open with "heart beat."

12:54.911 --> 12:56.944
You know, 'cause we're doctors.

12:56.946 --> 12:58.513
Huh? Huh!

13:04.052 --> 13:07.155
What's up, physicians
without fences?

13:07.157 --> 13:08.256
Yeah!

13:25.141 --> 13:26.841
No, no, no. There's only 12.
We're done.

13:26.843 --> 13:28.342
Oh.

13:28.344 --> 13:30.511
Thank you, Ecuador!

13:31.446 --> 13:32.947
Which is in South America.

13:36.852 --> 13:39.187
That was great. Thank you.

13:39.189 --> 13:40.788
We don't get much music up here.

13:40.790 --> 13:44.859
Well, doctor Roberts does some
karaoke, but it's pretty brutal.

13:45.961 --> 13:47.995
Linda, wait!

13:47.997 --> 13:50.998
You're great at other things,
like appendectomies!

13:52.835 --> 13:56.637
Anyway, your concert cheered us up
and made our Christmas feel special.

13:56.639 --> 13:59.106
Well, we wanted to thank you for
helping out with our student, Lily.

13:59.108 --> 14:02.977
She's gonna be so excited when we
bring her dad home for the holidays.

14:02.979 --> 14:05.112
Oh... about that...

14:05.114 --> 14:07.048
I probably should have
said this earlier.

14:07.050 --> 14:08.783
Lily's dad isn't here.

14:08.785 --> 14:10.184
What?

14:10.186 --> 14:12.220
He got an emergency phone
call this morning.

14:12.222 --> 14:14.121
He had to leave on a
special medical mission.

14:14.123 --> 14:16.123
Well, when is he coming back?

14:16.125 --> 14:18.159
I'm sorry, I have no idea.

14:18.161 --> 14:19.527
It could be days,
it could be weeks.

14:19.529 --> 14:20.995
Could it be minutes?

14:20.997 --> 14:23.197
Nope, just days or weeks.

14:25.167 --> 14:30.137
So we came all this way and now
we have to go home empty-handed?

14:30.139 --> 14:32.073
We got Lily's hopes
up for nothing.

14:33.008 --> 14:35.048
Looks like we just ruined a
little girl's Christmas.

14:35.844 --> 14:37.211
Hey!

14:37.213 --> 14:39.380
The outgoing canoe doesn't
leave for another two hours.

14:39.382 --> 14:42.617
You guys wanna hang
out, do some karaoke?

14:55.597 --> 14:57.231
49, 50!

14:57.233 --> 14:58.866
Disgraceful!

14:58.868 --> 15:01.335
You should be able to load that
sleigh in 30 seconds, tops.

15:01.337 --> 15:03.170
Again!

15:05.874 --> 15:07.909
Where in the blitzen
have you been?

15:09.845 --> 15:11.512
The elves and I have had enough!

15:11.514 --> 15:13.180
And we're taking back control.

15:13.182 --> 15:15.683
This is a merry, merry mutiny.

15:15.685 --> 15:18.152
You're going down, gingerbread!

15:19.288 --> 15:22.456
That's it, you're all going
on Santa's naughty list.

15:24.226 --> 15:26.861
Santa's elves are always nice.

15:28.064 --> 15:29.096
Attack!

15:29.098 --> 15:30.965
Oh, oh, oh!

15:30.967 --> 15:32.033
Don't do that!

15:33.970 --> 15:35.736
I've been hit, I've been hit!

15:40.309 --> 15:42.143
What the ho, ho, ho is going on?

15:43.412 --> 15:47.315
Jingletoes, marshmallow, this
is very un-elf-like behavior.

15:48.283 --> 15:50.384
I'm afraid you have to
hand in your bells.

15:50.386 --> 15:51.419
Aw!

15:51.421 --> 15:53.154
But I love being an elf.

15:54.489 --> 15:56.057
Don't worry, kid.

15:56.059 --> 15:59.427
The first time getting fired is always
the hardest, but it'll get easier.

15:59.429 --> 16:01.395
Santa, wait!

16:02.230 --> 16:03.264
It's not their fault.

16:03.266 --> 16:04.298
It's mine.

16:04.300 --> 16:05.933
I just wanted Christmas
to be perfect

16:05.935 --> 16:07.902
and I ended up acting
like a real scrooge.

16:08.937 --> 16:09.971
I'm sorry.

16:09.973 --> 16:11.653
Please don't put them
on the naughty list.

16:12.809 --> 16:19.447
Well, well, well, gingerbread, what
Christmas is really all about is the...

16:19.449 --> 16:20.581
I don't have time for this.

16:20.583 --> 16:23.017
You know what? It's Christmas Eve,
got lots of presents to deliver.

16:23.019 --> 16:24.100
Figure this out yourselves.

16:25.020 --> 16:26.554
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

16:28.357 --> 16:30.124
So does this mean
I'm still an elf?

16:30.126 --> 16:32.793
Hey, no one could replace
you, marshmallow.

16:32.795 --> 16:33.828
Yes!

16:33.830 --> 16:35.262
I'm sorry, guys.

16:35.264 --> 16:37.131
I guess I got a little
out of control.

16:37.133 --> 16:41.202
Maybe it's the Christmas spirit
talking, but I forgive you.

16:41.204 --> 16:43.437
I know you were just trying
to be good at your job.

16:43.439 --> 16:46.574
I don't understand it,
but I can respect it.

16:47.642 --> 16:48.909
Thanks, Jingletoes.

16:49.845 --> 16:52.213
Hey, look, you two are
under the mistletoe!

17:12.501 --> 17:14.300
What are you waiting for?

17:14.303 --> 17:17.338
The sooner you tell Lily her
dad isn't coming, the better.

17:18.540 --> 17:19.874
I know.

17:19.876 --> 17:22.476
Come on, Ally. Time to break
a little girl's heart.

17:23.545 --> 17:27.314
And then give her these
gifts to dull the pain.

17:28.250 --> 17:30.518
That's what my parents did
when my hamster died.

17:30.520 --> 17:31.986
They got me a bike.

17:33.155 --> 17:35.423
I cry every time I ride it.

17:37.359 --> 17:38.426
Hey, Lily!

17:38.428 --> 17:40.227
Can we talk to you for a second?

17:40.229 --> 17:41.295
Sure.

17:42.364 --> 17:45.533
Sometimes we want
something so badly,

17:45.535 --> 17:48.602
and it feels like it's the most
important thing in the world,

17:48.604 --> 17:51.238
but when you look at
the big picture...

17:51.240 --> 17:52.339
Your dad's not coming home.

17:52.341 --> 17:53.974
Merry Christmas!

17:54.910 --> 17:56.177
What?

17:56.179 --> 17:58.045
I am so sorry! We really tried.

17:58.047 --> 18:00.281
Ho, ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho, ho!

18:00.283 --> 18:03.250
Merry Christmas, everybody.

18:03.252 --> 18:07.688
Oh, I'm just making a quick stop
to drop off a very special present

18:07.690 --> 18:11.258
for a very special little girl.

18:11.260 --> 18:12.760
Daddy!

18:16.031 --> 18:18.299
Santa, how did you do it?

18:18.301 --> 18:19.600
Oh, well...

18:19.602 --> 18:22.203
Bringing someone home
from a far-off country,

18:22.205 --> 18:25.039
well, that is a tall
order even for Santa.

18:25.041 --> 18:28.476
Luckily, I had the
help of my head elf.

18:29.611 --> 18:31.378
Dez?

18:31.380 --> 18:33.147
It's true!

18:33.149 --> 18:36.383
But Dr. salt told us that Lily's
dad was off on a special mission.

18:36.385 --> 18:38.052
Yeah, this was it.

18:38.054 --> 18:40.921
A special mission to heal a
little girl's broken heart.

18:40.923 --> 18:42.323
I set it all up.

18:43.458 --> 18:45.326
Uh, why didn't you tell us?

18:46.495 --> 18:49.396
We literally fought off
wild animals in the jungle.

18:49.398 --> 18:51.065
I did tell you.

18:51.067 --> 18:53.834
I said Santa and I were gonna
bring home Lily's dad.

18:53.836 --> 18:56.737
I just had to make a couple calls, charge
a plane ticket to your credit card,

18:56.739 --> 18:58.506
and voila! Here he is!

18:59.441 --> 19:01.642
This is the best Christmas ever!

19:03.311 --> 19:05.813
Thanks for helping
Santa, gingerbread.

19:07.482 --> 19:08.916
Can we do our song now?

19:08.918 --> 19:10.684
I'm not getting any younger.

19:12.354 --> 19:13.687
That's a great idea.

19:17.492 --> 19:20.995
Thank you for coming to our special
holiday family and friends night.

19:20.997 --> 19:23.831
Now Austin, Ally, and the
kids would like to dedicate

19:23.833 --> 19:25.933
a special song they wrote
to Lily and her dad.

21:39.067 --> 21:40.234
You open yours first.

21:40.236 --> 21:41.335
No, you open yours first.

21:41.337 --> 21:42.403
No, you open yours first.

21:42.405 --> 21:43.437
- No, you open...
- No...

21:43.439 --> 21:45.472
Oh, for the love of
fruitcake, just open them.

21:46.675 --> 21:47.675
Okay.

21:49.477 --> 21:50.577
No way!

21:50.579 --> 21:52.413
My favorite photo of us!

21:52.415 --> 21:55.015
Wait, it's my
favorite photo of us.

21:55.950 --> 21:59.353
I swear, if you guys get any cuter,
next year we're cancelling Christmas.

22:00.655 --> 22:02.056
Trish, you go next.

22:04.192 --> 22:06.660
The cheetah print handbag
I emailed you all about?

22:06.662 --> 22:08.062
How did you know?

22:09.331 --> 22:11.298
Oh, there's one
more for you, Dez.

22:11.300 --> 22:12.700
It's from Santa.

22:14.669 --> 22:16.770
Aw, Santa must have
carved that for you.

22:16.772 --> 22:18.672
Well, he better go back
to carving school.

22:18.674 --> 22:19.707
What the heck is this?

22:19.709 --> 22:22.643
Uh, it's obviously a train.

22:23.679 --> 22:25.012
Mine are better.
