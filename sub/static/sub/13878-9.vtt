Tonight's episode ... "Lasagna."

00:38.206 --> 00:40.416
Oh, yeah, yeah, you know, I-I
fantasize about, uh, just

00:40.541 --> 00:42.484
walking in there with a gun.

00:42.609 --> 00:43.853
And...

00:43.978 --> 00:47.724
...If he asks me to fax one more
thing, I will fax his head to

00:47.849 --> 00:51.694
Jesus on the back of a hollow-point.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.763
Hmm. Interesting, Nick.

00:54.622 --> 00:55.498
Yeah, I feel pretty good.

00:55.623 --> 00:56.866
I don't know why I have to be here.

00:56.991 --> 00:59.124
Carl, you seem to be
waving your hands.

01:00.660 --> 01:02.595
"Thit" and what?

01:06.800 --> 01:09.612
Uh... he's trying to say
he doesn't agree with you.

01:09.737 --> 01:10.613
Thank you!

01:10.738 --> 01:14.517
Carl, there's absolutely no reason to
get angry in anger-management class.

01:14.642 --> 01:15.785
You have to be here anyway.

01:15.910 --> 01:17.420
So let's, uh, enjoy ourselves.

01:17.545 --> 01:19.478
Let's get involved.

01:39.699 --> 01:40.309
Oh, man!

01:40.434 --> 01:41.377
What a coincidence!

01:41.502 --> 01:44.447
Was her name cherries jubilee?

01:44.572 --> 01:48.951
I got news for you, man
... it's a fake name.

01:49.076 --> 01:52.755
Yeah. No. She's jewish.

01:52.880 --> 01:53.589
She bit me, too!

01:53.714 --> 01:56.058
But thanks to tongue alive, I
can finally say "see shells

01:56.183 --> 01:57.560
syphilis down by the seashore"!

01:57.685 --> 01:58.761
It brought my tongue back ine"!

01:58.886 --> 02:02.265
Two weeks, or most of your money back.

02:02.390 --> 02:03.900
I <i>am ...</i> extremely cool!

02:04.025 --> 02:05.268
Thanks to kool kreem.L!

02:05.393 --> 02:08.727
Apply thrice daily and
see instant results.

02:18.705 --> 02:20.706
Yeah, I saw the scram necklace.

02:27.514 --> 02:32.395
It sounds to me like you
need to use some kool kreem.

02:32.520 --> 02:32.995
Come on, man!

02:33.120 --> 02:34.430
Let's blow this taco stand!

02:34.555 --> 02:37.690
I'll show you all the cool
moves ... with kool kreem!

02:45.565 --> 02:47.043
Scam wow!

02:47.168 --> 02:48.444
Scam wow!

02:48.569 --> 02:50.502
This house is amazing!

02:57.277 --> 03:00.389
Hey. Did I do it right?

03:00.514 --> 03:04.460
Yeah, why don't you come and get me?

03:04.585 --> 03:06.518
Whoops!

03:10.657 --> 03:11.367
Oh, hold on.

03:11.492 --> 03:12.501
I got him right here.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.626
He wants to talk to you.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.774
He wants to talk to you again.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.309
I could do this all day.

03:22.837 --> 03:23.713
I bet you will.

03:23.838 --> 03:27.550
Stay off the streets, now, sweetie.

03:27.675 --> 03:28.651
Let it go, big man!

03:28.776 --> 03:30.853
That's what anger
management's all about.

03:30.978 --> 03:31.921
Now, check this out!

03:32.046 --> 03:33.979
T!

03:36.683 --> 03:38.928
They're just my new roto-sole
outdoor sneaker wear.

03:39.053 --> 03:41.764
They cut the grass while you
stand and they absorb your foot

03:41.889 --> 03:43.900
sweat and you can drink
it when you get hot.

03:44.025 --> 03:47.303
And if you order now, you can get a
second pair plus one pest-e-sock.

03:47.428 --> 03:48.638
It's a sock filled with poison.

03:48.763 --> 03:52.141
It keeps all the roaches out of your
shoes, your feet, and your house.

03:52.266 --> 03:55.611
Order now.

03:55.736 --> 03:56.445
Nothing, man.

03:56.570 --> 03:59.382
I just thought you might be
into some lawn-mowing shoes.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.517
I have a hard time
shutting up about work.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.452
That's what my other self tells me.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.587
But never mind that.

04:04.712 --> 04:06.705
Let's get that drink!

04:11.251 --> 04:14.553
How about some of my
filtered foot sweat?

04:17.257 --> 04:20.202
How about scam wow?

04:20.327 --> 04:20.870
Mmm!

04:20.995 --> 04:21.803
What you cooking?

04:23.397 --> 04:23.773
Ooh! Lasagna!

04:23.898 --> 04:24.774
Quattro formaggio!

04:24.899 --> 04:26.142
Like-a mama used to make!

04:26.267 --> 04:28.744
Hell, I
didn't know you could cook.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.447
Yeah,
for special occasions.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.916
Uh, why are you
drilling a hole in the pan?

04:34.041 --> 04:37.509
The cheese needs to breathe.

04:39.737 --> 04:40.456
Come on, fat boy!

04:40.581 --> 04:41.424
Look what's cooking!

04:41.549 --> 04:42.824
Scam wow!

04:42.949 --> 04:44.993
That's some serious lasagna!

04:55.495 --> 04:56.505
Hey, Carl.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.473
Good afternoon.

04:57.598 --> 05:01.233
I just brought some lasagna for you!

05:05.438 --> 05:08.351
I just thought you'd maybe want
to take a little brisk walk.

05:08.476 --> 05:11.844
I mean, there <i>are</i> four
kinds of cheese in there.

05:16.783 --> 05:18.361
Don't let it get cold. Uh-oh.

05:18.486 --> 05:19.528
Carl, look at this!

05:19.653 --> 05:24.533
The ants are starting
to run off with it!

05:24.658 --> 05:28.237
Wow. I just ... I
intercepted it myself.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.873
You know, from the ants.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.476
Oh. That's too bad.

05:33.601 --> 05:37.880
I guess I'll just...
Toss this down the sewer in front of you.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.448
Hmm.

05:39.573 --> 05:42.885
This probably <i>was</i> the
best batch I ever made.

05:43.010 --> 05:43.853
Oh.

05:43.978 --> 05:47.590
You didn't ... you didn't
want any of this, did you?

05:47.715 --> 05:51.327
Then let's see if you've
got the legs for it.

05:56.289 --> 05:57.923
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

05:59.592 --> 06:00.403
Ohh!

06:00.528 --> 06:03.829
So close to marinara town!

06:07.233 --> 06:09.245
Well, I'll see you in the fall, fats!

06:09.370 --> 06:12.014
Look, Carl, you know
you're gonna get shammed.

06:12.139 --> 06:13.215
You got to strategize.

06:13.340 --> 06:14.884
It's like dealing with girls.

06:15.009 --> 06:18.154
You see a pretty girl you like,
you ain't gonna get her unless

06:18.279 --> 06:21.524
you pounce on it.

06:21.649 --> 06:25.361
Then you got to play it like a
cool customer, and after time,

06:25.486 --> 06:28.230
it'll come to <i>you</i> and
ask you to pay for <i>it.</i>

06:28.355 --> 06:34.070
<i>But if you don't pay, it'll
bite your tongue off.</i>

06:34.195 --> 06:35.538
<i>I'll show you how to roll, man.</i>

06:35.663 --> 06:36.839
<i>Call your friend back.</i>

06:38.165 --> 06:40.065
<i>Oh.</i>

06:44.204 --> 06:45.481
<i>Oh. Hungry, huh?</i>

06:45.606 --> 06:48.851
<i>Hmm...
You want some pasta?</i>

06:48.976 --> 06:51.387
<i>First of all,
this is incredibly cruel.</i>

06:51.512 --> 06:53.089
<i>I am incredibly bored.</i>

06:53.214 --> 06:55.424
<i>You told me to follow my dreams.</i>

06:55.549 --> 06:56.358
<i>Well, this is it, man!</i>

06:56.483 --> 06:57.193
<i>This is my dream!</i>

06:57.318 --> 06:59.361
<i>Second, when did
you ever learn how to make</i>

06:59.486 --> 07:00.096
<i>homemade lasagna?</i>

07:00.221 --> 07:01.464
<i>When I
was in New York.</i>

07:01.589 --> 07:03.332
<i>When were
you ever in New York?!</i>

07:03.457 --> 07:04.300
<i>Food!</i>

07:04.425 --> 07:06.469
<i>Frylock, he got food in
there ... real food!</i>

07:06.594 --> 07:08.003
<i>We've been eating dog food.</i>

07:08.128 --> 07:09.438
<i>Yeah. I've seen you.</i>

07:09.563 --> 07:11.507
<i>From that dumb mutt
across the street?</i>

07:11.632 --> 07:14.076
<i>You said those
were bacon croutons!</i>

07:14.201 --> 07:15.010
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:15.135 --> 07:17.113
<i>Occasionally, I will
raid his pan, yes.</i>

07:18.038 --> 07:19.315
<i>Come-a to mama Mia!</i>

07:19.440 --> 07:21.350
<i>Just-a like-a back
in the old country!</i>

07:21.475 --> 07:22.751
<i>>> Ignore it, big man!</i>

07:22.876 --> 07:23.819
<i>You don't need that!</i>

07:23.944 --> 07:25.887
<i>Now, that's Italian.</i>

07:33.920 --> 07:36.031
<i>>> Scam wow! I'm proud of you!</i>

07:36.156 --> 07:37.833
<i>W gonoo the roof!</i>

07:37.958 --> 07:39.168
<i>Hmm.</i>

07:39.293 --> 07:40.903
<i>That's impossible.</i>

07:41.028 --> 07:43.038
<i>Everyone</i> craves
my four-cheese lasagna.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.975
I ain't never had
cheese what come from a cow.

07:46.100 --> 07:48.810
I got cheese what come from a can.

07:48.935 --> 07:49.812
And that ain't cheese, y'all.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.714
That is hair spray.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.949
The only cheese you'll
get is nacho cheese, which is

07:54.074 --> 07:56.417
Italian for "not your cheese."

07:56.542 --> 07:58.787
In-a your face!

07:58.912 --> 07:59.688
Dang.

07:59.813 --> 08:00.723
I want to learn Italian.

08:00.848 --> 08:02.258
He ain't coming, shake.

08:02.383 --> 08:03.759
He finally figured it out, man.

08:03.884 --> 08:07.096
Every time he goes for the lasagna, he
knows you're gonna pull that string.

08:07.221 --> 08:08.230
Not <i>every</i> time.

08:08.355 --> 08:10.132
There is that time when I
<i>don't pull it.</i>

08:10.257 --> 08:12.167
<i>But most</i> times.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.226
Yeah, <i>most</i> times.

08:20.366 --> 08:22.011
That's impossible, Carl.

08:22.136 --> 08:24.613
No one breaks <i>every</i>
bone in their body.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.949
You just got to believe in yourself.

08:27.074 --> 08:28.651
You can do this!

08:28.776 --> 08:30.742
And I can watch it!

08:39.452 --> 08:41.397
Hey!

08:41.522 --> 08:42.231
Oh!

08:42.356 --> 08:43.198
Carl, are you okay?

08:44.291 --> 08:45.935
We got to get him to a hospital!

08:46.060 --> 08:49.238
We've <i>really</i> got
to get him to a hospital!

08:49.363 --> 08:51.974
Take off the damn necklace,
man, before you kill him!

08:52.099 --> 08:52.908
You're not a doctor!

08:53.033 --> 08:54.966
I'm taking him to the hospital!

08:58.938 --> 09:02.151
Okay, maybe we're not gonna
make it to the hospital.

09:02.276 --> 09:02.818
Dude!

09:02.943 --> 09:05.187
You broke every bone in your body!

09:05.312 --> 09:07.756
That's insane!

09:07.881 --> 09:08.390
You're in luck!

09:08.515 --> 09:09.792
Because I've got uni-bone!

09:09.917 --> 09:12.628
Drink one nutritional shake every
three to five minutes, and

09:12.753 --> 09:14.330
your skeleton will
heal as good as new.

09:14.455 --> 09:15.764
For fractures! For breaks!

09:15.889 --> 09:16.899
For sprains! For twists!

09:17.024 --> 09:17.399
For tears!

09:17.524 --> 09:19.301
The bone-a-nizer is the only solution.

09:19.426 --> 09:22.137
And if you act now, I'll throw
in a free pair of roto-shoes.

09:22.262 --> 09:26.208
Mow your lawn while
your skeleton heals.

09:26.333 --> 09:26.775
Dude!

09:26.900 --> 09:28.777
The accusations are flying in here!

09:28.902 --> 09:33.705
How about I brew you up a cup of
insta-bone regena-bone bonernizer?

09:35.808 --> 09:37.752
Scam wow!

09:37.877 --> 09:41.390
It appears that your bones
have merged into, what we call

09:41.515 --> 09:44.827
in the medical community, one
large, hideous super bone.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.195
That makes sense.

09:46.320 --> 09:47.129
Ah!

09:47.254 --> 09:50.065
So, is there some sort of
nutritional shake that I can

09:50.190 --> 09:51.900
drink to counteract this whole thing?

09:52.025 --> 09:54.436
Well, first off, I would stop
drinking <i>any</i> milkshake that

09:54.561 --> 09:55.638
claims to be medicine.

09:55.763 --> 09:58.707
I'm supposed to drink these
every three to five minutes.

09:58.832 --> 10:01.176
You know, they're fat-free, and
they're good for fractures,

10:01.301 --> 10:04.013
breaks, sprains, what
have you, you know.

10:04.138 --> 10:06.071
What's this?

10:20.953 --> 10:24.433
Carl, now, I know
you know better than that.

10:24.558 --> 10:24.967
I know.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.969
Probably burn the roof
of my mouth, right?

10:27.561 --> 10:29.271
Smells pretty good, though, don't it?

10:29.396 --> 10:31.974
Yeah, you need to
leave that lasagna alone, man.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.075
Get back here.

10:33.567 --> 10:35.244
All right, I'll see ya.

10:35.369 --> 10:36.412
You get back here!

10:38.005 --> 10:42.284
"Get that noodle, noodle
brain," said the spider to the fly.

10:51.114 --> 10:52.819
The milkshake is really good.
