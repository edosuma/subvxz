Where did you get that?

00:55.222 --> 00:56.688
- I made it.
- What?

00:56.724 --> 00:58.357
At Trent Brothers Toys!

00:58.392 --> 00:59.925
All of
our Fantastic Flyer toys

00:59.960 --> 01:01.271
will be soaring into stores
next year!

01:01.295 --> 01:02.828
Oh! Sounds like
a good reason

01:02.863 --> 01:05.297
to stay on Santa's
Nice List, right?

01:05.331 --> 01:06.332
- Exactly.
- Definitely.

01:07.868 --> 01:09.201
- Bye!
- Bye.

01:09.236 --> 01:10.836
All right,
Captain Christmas,

01:10.871 --> 01:11.970
back to work.

01:12.006 --> 01:14.006
George, this is work.

01:14.041 --> 01:16.075
We've got a max-range problem.
Watch.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.517
See what I mean?

01:25.553 --> 01:26.663
And if kids are going
to be using this,

01:26.687 --> 01:28.331
I got to make sure the landing
recovery goes smoothly.

01:28.355 --> 01:30.622
I've got to make sure
this deal goes smoothly.

01:30.658 --> 01:33.125
I've got a conference call
with Hennessey in 15.

01:34.361 --> 01:35.527
Wait... that's today?

01:35.563 --> 01:37.129
Little brother, this year,

01:37.164 --> 01:38.508
I'm giving you a day planner
for Christmas.

01:38.532 --> 01:39.431
That's what you gave me
last year.

01:39.467 --> 01:41.400
Yeah, but this year,
you're going to use it.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.901
Good luck with that.

01:42.937 --> 01:44.303
Come on.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.640
I can't thank you
enough, Lydia.

01:48.676 --> 01:50.087
I don't know what I would
have done without you.

01:50.111 --> 01:51.510
I'm glad
I could help.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.645
Help?
You're amazing.

01:53.681 --> 01:54.991
Ever since
I started this new job,

01:55.015 --> 01:56.560
I feel like
I've been running in circles,

01:56.584 --> 01:58.250
but one week with you

01:58.285 --> 01:59.918
showing me
how to organize everything,

01:59.954 --> 02:01.353
and I feel

02:01.388 --> 02:02.933
like I can finally catch
my breath again.

02:02.957 --> 02:04.590
Well, it's all
about strategizing,

02:04.625 --> 02:05.724
getting your
ducks in a row,

02:05.759 --> 02:07.593
and that's what
I help people do.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.261
And just in time
for Christmas, too!

02:09.295 --> 02:10.262
Well, hopefully, you
can enjoy your Christmas

02:10.297 --> 02:11.096
a little bit better now.

02:11.132 --> 02:13.265
Oh, don't worry, I will,
thanks to you.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.266

<i>Here's Mr. Hennessey.</i>

02:32.586 --> 02:34.353
Good morning,
George, Robert.

02:34.388 --> 02:35.388
How're you
fellas doing?

02:35.422 --> 02:36.288
Just fine, Mr. Hennessey.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.923
How's the holiday
season treating you

02:37.958 --> 02:39.525
and our favorite
superstore?

02:39.560 --> 02:41.371
Well, as I always say,
you take care of business,

02:41.395 --> 02:42.961
and business
will take care of you,

02:42.997 --> 02:44.541
and Hennessey's off
to a great start this Christmas.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.031
You can look forward

02:46.066 --> 02:47.377
to an even better
holiday next year,

02:47.401 --> 02:48.478
when you're stocking
Trent Brothers Toys

02:48.502 --> 02:49.468
in all of your stores.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.469
Mm-hmm,
we're very excited

02:50.504 --> 02:51.303
to share
our new line with you

02:51.338 --> 02:53.438
when you come to visit
in February.

02:53.474 --> 02:54.985
<i>Well, that's why
I'm calling, fellas.</i>

02:55.009 --> 02:57.053
I've decided to get a jump
on choosing my new vendors

02:57.077 --> 02:58.043
for next year.

02:58.078 --> 02:59.912
When you say "jump,"
you mean...

02:59.947 --> 03:01.980
<i>I'll be flying out
to see you on the 22n.</i>

03:02.016 --> 03:03.815
Wait, uh...
December 22nd?

03:03.851 --> 03:05.551
My wife will join us
for supper,

03:05.586 --> 03:06.952
and then we're off

03:06.987 --> 03:08.165
to see the grandkids
for Christmas Eve.

03:08.189 --> 03:11.390
Oh, I hope the short notice
isn't going to be a problem.

03:11.425 --> 03:12.891
Problem?

03:12.927 --> 03:14.259
No... what?

03:14.295 --> 03:15.260
Absolutely not.

03:15.296 --> 03:17.296
December 22 is...
is perfect.

03:17.331 --> 03:19.565
Yeah, yeah, George and I
were just saying,

03:19.600 --> 03:20.566
"It's too bad

03:20.601 --> 03:22.968
Mr. Hennessey can't visit
during the holidays."

03:23.003 --> 03:24.114
That way, you can come see
the new line of toys,

03:24.138 --> 03:26.305
and you and your wife can join
us for Christmas dinner.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.439
Right.

03:27.474 --> 03:28.585
I mean,
we are a family business.

03:28.609 --> 03:29.575
What could be better

03:29.610 --> 03:32.244
than a traditional family
Christmas dinner?

03:32.279 --> 03:33.245
And you can meet
my kids, too.

03:33.280 --> 03:34.246
Oh, they're great kids.

03:34.281 --> 03:35.914
You're going
to love them,

03:35.950 --> 03:36.915
and Robert's house
will be perfect

03:36.951 --> 03:37.916
for Christmas dinner.

03:37.952 --> 03:39.284
<i>Well, you know,</i>

03:39.320 --> 03:40.463
<i>that sounds like
a fine idea, fellas.</i>

03:40.487 --> 03:42.588
<i>I mean, we're all about family
here at Hennessey's.</i>

03:42.623 --> 03:44.601
<i>Sheila and I, well,
we'll be there with bells on!</i>

03:44.625 --> 03:46.124
- Great!
- Yay.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.659
I'll see you fellas
in two weeks.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.261
Can't wait!

03:51.699 --> 03:53.265
My house?

03:53.300 --> 03:54.099
What was I
supposed to say?

03:54.134 --> 03:55.634
My place is still
a construction site.

03:55.669 --> 03:56.602
It's never going
to be ready

03:56.637 --> 03:57.769
in time for Christmas.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.171
But we can take
the Hennesseys

03:59.206 --> 04:00.272
to a nice restaurant.

04:00.307 --> 04:01.773
Are you kidding?
You heard the man.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.342
Hennessey's
is all about family.

04:03.377 --> 04:04.610
I heard.

04:11.685 --> 04:12.718
Bobby, I'm sorry.

04:12.753 --> 04:13.986
I just wasn't thinking.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.422
It's all right.
I just...

04:21.327 --> 04:22.194
Listen...

04:22.229 --> 04:23.506
maybe a restaurant's
not a bad idea...

04:23.530 --> 04:25.964
No, George, look,
you're right.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.477
Hennessey is expecting
a family dinner,

04:27.501 --> 04:29.301
and that's
what we have to give him.

04:29.336 --> 04:31.403
Yeah,
but I can tell him something.

04:31.438 --> 04:32.549
Look, we have
a real opportunity here

04:32.573 --> 04:33.505
to impress Hennessey

04:33.540 --> 04:35.340
and get our toys
into over 300 of his stores.

04:35.376 --> 04:36.508
Let's make
the most of it.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.744
It would be nice not to have
to skate by for a change.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.178
Skating.

04:42.049 --> 04:42.848
Oh, hockey...
I... um...

04:42.883 --> 04:44.716
I've got to get Thomas
to practice.

04:47.221 --> 04:49.288
Everything is going
to be fine.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.660
I'm not going anywhere
without these.

04:54.695 --> 04:55.594
It's all good.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.963
Don't worry
about a thing.

04:59.366 --> 05:01.066
Why would I worry?

05:03.437 --> 05:05.103
And that...

05:05.139 --> 05:06.238
is that!

05:06.273 --> 05:09.007
Lydia,
I love what you've done!

05:09.043 --> 05:11.109
This is the best
Christmas present ever.

05:11.145 --> 05:12.878
I'm happy to do it for you.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.413
I'm so lucky
that my best friend

05:14.448 --> 05:16.092
is the most brilliant
professional organizer

05:16.116 --> 05:17.215
on the planet!

05:17.251 --> 05:18.550
Oh, maybe not on the planet.

05:18.585 --> 05:20.419
I still don't
know how you do it.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.465
When it comes to organizing,
every space is different.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.423
You just have to learn
to read the signs.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.958
Take you and Eric,
for example.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.428
In a marriage,
you have to make choices,

05:29.463 --> 05:30.529
and I am here

05:30.564 --> 05:32.531
to help you get rid
of the things you don't need,

05:32.566 --> 05:35.634
and make room for
the things you want,

05:35.669 --> 05:39.604
so there's a place
for things you love,

05:39.640 --> 05:43.208
and space for the things
that he loves,

05:43.243 --> 05:44.743
and a special place

05:44.778 --> 05:47.446
for the things
that you love together.

05:52.252 --> 05:53.952
This app of yours
is amazing.

05:53.987 --> 05:54.753
So glad you're
using it,

05:54.788 --> 05:55.587
and don't just
use the calendar.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.723
You should use
the reminders, too.

05:57.758 --> 05:58.802
Well, right now
it's reminding me

05:58.826 --> 06:00.959
that I need to get to the store
to help Eric open.

06:00.994 --> 06:03.095
The Christmas shopping rush
is in full swing.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.596
Why don't you
come with me?

06:04.631 --> 06:05.564
You can listen to me

06:05.599 --> 06:07.733
brag to Eric
about how incredible you are.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.468
Well, maybe just for a minute.

06:14.675 --> 06:17.275
Okay, here we go.
I'm sorry I was late, guys.

06:17.311 --> 06:18.477
Work always gets a little...

06:18.512 --> 06:19.745
Crazy this time of year?

06:19.780 --> 06:20.645
Yeah, exactly.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.258
I mean, when you are
in the toy business...

06:22.282 --> 06:24.082
Christmas
is your busiest time.

06:24.118 --> 06:25.161
I've mentioned this before?

06:25.185 --> 06:26.251
Once or twice.

06:26.286 --> 06:28.920
Did you remember
to pick up the stuff

06:28.956 --> 06:30.700
to make Christmas cookies
for my class party?

06:30.724 --> 06:33.024
Cookies.
Right.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.270
You said we were
going to bake them

06:34.294 --> 06:35.360
just like Mom used to.

06:35.396 --> 06:36.795
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

06:36.830 --> 06:37.830
We will, buddy.

06:38.665 --> 06:40.999
All right.
We all set?

06:42.169 --> 06:43.169
All right,
go have fun!

06:52.146 --> 06:53.712
So, how was school today?

06:53.747 --> 06:55.113
Okay.

06:55.149 --> 06:56.314
You know,

06:56.350 --> 06:57.827
everyone's all excited
about Christmas.

06:57.851 --> 07:00.685
Well, sure.
Haven't you heard?

07:00.721 --> 07:04.156
♪ It's the most wonderful time
of the year ♪

07:05.359 --> 07:07.192
Got to get
some new material, Dad.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.493
Bah!

07:08.529 --> 07:09.895
I'll work on it.

07:09.930 --> 07:10.940
It is going to be so great,

07:10.964 --> 07:13.565
hanging out with you guys
during the break...

07:13.600 --> 07:15.734
making cookies,
decorating the tree...

07:15.769 --> 07:17.969
Oh, not to mention
I get to see a certain someone

07:18.005 --> 07:19.371
in the Christmas
Festival play.

07:19.406 --> 07:21.573
I told you.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.742
Ms. Cafferty cast me
as Santa's Head Elf.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.144
Mm-hmm,
and it's great.

07:27.581 --> 07:30.849
It's a big part...
a lot of lines.

07:30.884 --> 07:31.950
I...

07:31.985 --> 07:34.052
I was thinking I would just let
someone else do it.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.558
Well, I...

07:39.593 --> 07:41.927
I kind of thought
you liked being in the play.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.361
It's no big deal.

07:43.397 --> 07:45.397
No big deal?
Well, it is to me.

07:45.432 --> 07:46.398
Really?

07:46.433 --> 07:47.599
Are you kidding?

07:47.634 --> 07:48.467
I can't wait
to see you up there,

07:48.502 --> 07:50.035
bossing all those other elves
around.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.704
It's not that kind
of Head Elf, Dad.

07:52.739 --> 07:53.739
Well, all right.

07:53.774 --> 07:54.639
Well, you know,

07:54.675 --> 07:57.008
maybe I come and watch
rehearsal on Monday,

07:57.044 --> 07:58.388
and then after, I can help you
with your lines.

07:58.412 --> 08:00.045
Aren't you too busy, Dad?

08:02.115 --> 08:03.615
Honey, listen.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.817
I am never too busy
for you or your brother, okay?

08:07.554 --> 08:09.120
Oh! I need a hat
for my costume.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.366
All right, well,
then tomorrow, we'll go out

08:10.390 --> 08:12.090
and we'll find a hat
that's just right

08:12.125 --> 08:15.093
for Santa's
Not-Too-Bossy Head Elf.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.795
Sounds great.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.897
All right.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.333
I have a great idea

08:21.368 --> 08:23.869
to help you and Eric stay
organized after the holidays...

08:23.904 --> 08:26.037
a set of stacking bins,

08:26.073 --> 08:28.073
labeled for all your
Christmas decorations.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.374
I love this time of year.

08:29.409 --> 08:30.442
Yeah, me too.

08:30.477 --> 08:32.255
You know, tomorrow, I have
to pick up some things

08:32.279 --> 08:33.410
for another client.

08:33.447 --> 08:35.313
I could get you
those bins

08:35.349 --> 08:36.280
while I'm there.

08:36.316 --> 08:37.182
Or you could stop organizing
for a second,

08:37.217 --> 08:39.818
and take in this beautiful
Christmas cheer.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.397
Okay, I just have to
put in one more thing...

08:41.421 --> 08:42.386
Oh!

08:42.422 --> 08:43.955
Honey,
you are a genius,

08:43.991 --> 08:45.668
but even Einstein
took time off now and then.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.659
What?
I take time off.

08:47.694 --> 08:48.793
Seriously, though...

08:48.829 --> 08:50.473
you know that my whole life
is in that phone, right?

08:50.497 --> 08:52.797
Okay, that right there,
that can't be good.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.232
Dividing your whole life

08:54.268 --> 08:56.501
into a bunch
of neat little squares?

08:56.537 --> 08:59.070
For your information,
they aren't squares.

08:59.106 --> 09:02.173
Yeah, they're "modules."
That sounds much better.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.476
Uh, hey, who's Tony?

09:04.511 --> 09:05.944
Uh, nobody.
He's just...

09:05.979 --> 09:07.345
a client.

09:07.381 --> 09:09.180
Dinner and a movie?

09:09.216 --> 09:10.460
Since when do you go out
with clients?

09:10.484 --> 09:12.350
Okay, can I have
my phone back, please?

09:12.386 --> 09:13.818
You went on a date.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.420
Oh, come on, don't
say it like that.

09:15.455 --> 09:16.421
Come on! Tell!

09:16.456 --> 09:19.024
The movie was good.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.059
Let me guess...

09:20.093 --> 09:22.994
he doesn't know that Sirius
is the name of a star,

09:23.030 --> 09:25.630
and his idea of organizing
is wearing socks that match?

09:25.666 --> 09:28.533
Yeah, not to mention
he called me "Linda" all night,

09:28.569 --> 09:31.603
even after I reminded
him my name is "Lydia,"

09:31.638 --> 09:33.772
He said I looked
like a Linda.

09:33.807 --> 09:34.807
Sorry.

09:34.841 --> 09:36.107
No, it's okay.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.143
Some things in life,
you just can't organize,

09:38.178 --> 09:40.879
and that includes
a promising relationship.

09:40.914 --> 09:41.991
Well, that doesn't mean
you stop looking.

09:42.015 --> 09:45.350
No, I'm pretty sure
that's exactly what that means.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.291
Vroom, vroom...

09:53.327 --> 09:54.693
Hats, hats, hats, hats...

09:54.728 --> 09:56.394
There they are!

10:03.770 --> 10:04.703
Now, the one question is,

10:04.738 --> 10:07.339
what kind of hat
would Santa's Head Elf wear?

10:09.242 --> 10:10.275
Does it jingle,

10:10.310 --> 10:12.270
so everyone knows
when she's arrived on the stage?

10:13.347 --> 10:14.713
No? Okay.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.817
Or does it light up
the room,

10:18.852 --> 10:20.196
like the beautiful girl
who's wearing it?

10:20.220 --> 10:21.186
Dad...

10:21.221 --> 10:22.854
She needs an elf hat, Dad!

10:24.391 --> 10:25.857
Okay, I want the truth.

10:25.892 --> 10:27.325
Does this make my head
look big?

10:28.795 --> 10:30.428
A little bit.

10:30.464 --> 10:31.429
Dad, don't forget,

10:31.465 --> 10:32.909
we still have to get the stuff
to make cookies.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.205
Dad?

10:41.808 --> 10:42.774
Cookies, absolutely.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.576
Next on our list!

10:44.611 --> 10:46.277
Man, we are really busy.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.947
I mean, not only do we have
Thomas's Christmas party,

10:48.982 --> 10:50.181
we have your play,

10:50.217 --> 10:51.950
and we have
a very important guest

10:51.985 --> 10:52.917
coming for Christmas dinner!

10:52.953 --> 10:54.085
Who?

10:54.121 --> 10:56.354
None other than the big boss
himself of Hennessey's...

10:56.390 --> 10:57.489
this store!

10:57.524 --> 11:00.692
And we are going to cook him
an awesome Christmas feast.

11:00.727 --> 11:01.860
At our house?

11:01.895 --> 11:02.694
Yeah, why not?

11:02.729 --> 11:04.362
I mean, sure,
we have too much to plan

11:04.398 --> 11:05.130
and not enough time,

11:05.165 --> 11:06.865
and it's going to be
totally crazy,

11:06.900 --> 11:08.366
but it's going
to be fun...

11:08.402 --> 11:10.046
which is why I need
to talk to one of the engineers

11:10.070 --> 11:10.835
for just a second,

11:10.871 --> 11:12.081
so you guys keep
looking for hats...

11:12.105 --> 11:13.204
just give me a second.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.572
Okay.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.710
Garrett, hey.
What's going on?

11:19.846 --> 11:21.491
A range extender
would definitely give the sleigh

11:21.515 --> 11:22.747
more height.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.263
Yeah, but what about
the extra weight?

11:26.319 --> 11:29.788
Um, let me, uh,
let me work that out here.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.122
Oh, um...

11:44.037 --> 11:45.170
Sorry.

11:45.205 --> 11:48.239
He gets a little distracted
when it comes to his toys.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.809
I hope he's been
a good boy this year.

11:50.844 --> 11:51.943
He tries.

11:51.978 --> 11:52.844
Okay, okay...

11:52.879 --> 11:54.913
that is 768 grams,

11:54.948 --> 11:56.988
which still works with
our thrust-to-weight vectors.

11:58.118 --> 11:58.883
Great.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.852
Yeah, I'll be there
in a few hours.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.887
Okay. Too much to do.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.439
I'm sorry.
Were you going to buy that?

12:09.463 --> 12:11.162
No, no, it's no problem,

12:11.198 --> 12:12.475
but I do tend
to pay a little more attention

12:12.499 --> 12:14.365
when I hear words like
"Too much to do".

12:14.401 --> 12:17.102
See, the secret to
every busy life

12:17.137 --> 12:18.470
is organization...

12:18.505 --> 12:19.471
Uh-huh?

12:19.506 --> 12:22.440
And the best way
to get organized

12:22.476 --> 12:23.842
is to get some help.

12:25.212 --> 12:28.480
And you are
a professional organizer.

12:28.515 --> 12:30.348
Lydia Evans. Hi.

12:30.383 --> 12:31.950
Hi. They...

12:31.985 --> 12:34.119
they really have
professional organizers?

12:34.154 --> 12:36.488
Sure, just someone who helps
make someone else's life

12:36.523 --> 12:37.489
a little easier.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.190
Oh. Well...

12:39.226 --> 12:41.292
I appreciate it,
but, um...

12:41.328 --> 12:42.705
I think I have
everything under control.

12:42.729 --> 12:44.529
You do?

12:46.233 --> 12:47.744
We need to go get
the stuff for Thomas's cookies.

12:47.768 --> 12:49.701
Happy holidays!

12:49.736 --> 12:51.069
You too.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.070
Bye!

12:52.105 --> 12:53.071
Hey, you found a hat!

12:53.106 --> 12:53.972
Yeah!
You like it?

12:54.007 --> 12:55.184
Yes! All right, come on.
Hop on, let's go!

13:15.228 --> 13:17.195
When you're arranging a room,

13:17.230 --> 13:20.165
remember
that the Poinsettia plant

13:20.200 --> 13:21.200
you get for Christmas...

13:22.702 --> 13:24.636
prefers direct sunlight.

13:25.806 --> 13:29.040
Don't let the leaves
touch the glass.

13:31.778 --> 13:33.511
Thatta boy!
Hey, Thomas!

13:33.547 --> 13:34.879
Good job!

13:34.915 --> 13:37.215
Ah-hah!
Take that!

13:37.250 --> 13:39.217
What is he going to do now,
ladies and gentlemen?

13:42.789 --> 13:46.357
Hey, George!
What's up?

13:46.393 --> 13:47.859
Yeah.

13:47.894 --> 13:49.594
Uh-huh, yeah, I just...
just a second.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.763
Yeah, that's all I got.

13:51.798 --> 13:54.599
Well, let's just
make sure it works,

13:54.634 --> 13:57.202
before we worry about
the cost, George.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.203
Yep. Okay.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.504
Yeah, I'll talk
to you tomorrow.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.080
Dad, it's your move.

14:09.115 --> 14:10.281
Okay.

14:11.818 --> 14:12.650
Hey!

14:12.686 --> 14:16.154
Wait, wait a minute!
How did this happen?

14:16.189 --> 14:17.722
Hey, you step away
for one second...

14:17.757 --> 14:19.757
All right, I'm going
to get you now.

14:41.615 --> 14:43.081
Love you, Mom.

14:58.899 --> 15:01.599
Bye, honey.
Have a good day!

15:13.880 --> 15:15.057
Okay, so you're going home
with your buddy, Doug,

15:15.081 --> 15:16.281
after school.

15:16.316 --> 15:17.715
Yep.
'Bye, Dad!

15:17.751 --> 15:18.683
Bye, love you.
Have a good day...

15:18.718 --> 15:21.319
and I will see you
after school for rehearsal.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.254
Okay! Bye!

15:25.058 --> 15:26.090
Oh, Dad?

15:26.893 --> 15:28.293
Thanks.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.661
You're going to be great.

15:39.005 --> 15:40.738
It's a great idea, George.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.206
If we add these
range extenders,

15:42.242 --> 15:44.242
the price goes up
$20 a unit.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.310
Okay, trust me,

15:45.345 --> 15:46.244
when these hit the shelves,

15:46.279 --> 15:47.111
we'll more than make up for it
in sales.

15:47.147 --> 15:50.348
If we get them
into Hennessey's stores.

15:50.383 --> 15:51.549
Speaking of which...

15:51.584 --> 15:52.595
while you're working out
the menu,

15:52.619 --> 15:54.230
I found out Hennessey's
wife is a vegetarian.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.219
What?

15:55.255 --> 15:56.521
She doesn't mind

15:56.556 --> 15:57.488
the traditional
Christmas dinner...

15:57.524 --> 16:00.258
just make sure
she doesn't go home hungry.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.693
Ugh, great.

16:01.728 --> 16:02.860
Thanks.

16:02.896 --> 16:05.396
Glazed parsnip...

16:05.432 --> 16:07.332
chestnut and feta loaf...

16:08.868 --> 16:10.335
beetroot and shallot tarte,
hmm...

16:12.138 --> 16:13.237
Ready for a test drive?

16:13.273 --> 16:15.506
You kidding?
Absolutely.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.543
Garrett,
you did it, man!

16:18.578 --> 16:19.755
Every kid in the
country's going to want

16:19.779 --> 16:21.679
a Santa Soaring Sleigh
under the tree!

16:21.715 --> 16:23.548
Hey, you're the genius.

16:23.583 --> 16:24.783
I'm just one of Santa's elves.

16:24.818 --> 16:26.250
Elves.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.686
Oh, no.

16:28.722 --> 16:30.254
- No, no, no, no, no, no...
- Hey!

16:30.290 --> 16:31.990
I gotta go.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.325
No, no!

16:38.331 --> 16:40.598
Excuse me.

16:43.903 --> 16:44.903
Am', I...

16:46.072 --> 16:47.072
I am so sorry, honey.

16:48.742 --> 16:49.607
It's okay.

16:49.642 --> 16:50.575
No, no, it's not okay.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.477
I promised you I'd be
here, and I just...

16:52.512 --> 16:54.145
I got...

16:54.180 --> 16:55.146
I got busy again.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.714
I told you, Dad.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.049
It's no big deal.

17:18.304 --> 17:19.670
Hey, kiddo.

17:19.705 --> 17:20.671
You ready to run lines?

17:20.707 --> 17:22.906
It's okay, Dad.

17:35.655 --> 17:36.621
Hey, buddy.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.823
Whatcha drawing?

17:42.862 --> 17:44.395
Oh...

17:49.469 --> 17:51.669
Looks just like Mom.

17:51.704 --> 17:52.670
Hey...

17:52.705 --> 17:54.172
don't you worry.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.451
We're going to make
those cookies for your class.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.008
Amelia says you're too busy.

17:58.645 --> 17:59.977
No.
We're going to make 'em.

18:01.381 --> 18:03.347
Just like Mom used to.

18:20.834 --> 18:21.799
Lydia Evans.

18:21.835 --> 18:23.701
Uh, hi, yeah.
This is Robert Trent calling.

18:23.736 --> 18:26.804
<i>Uh, we, uh, we met yesterday
at Hennessey's?</i>

18:26.840 --> 18:27.605
Oh, right!

18:27.640 --> 18:29.674
Well,
we actually didn't "meet."

18:29.709 --> 18:30.675
I was with my kids,

18:30.710 --> 18:32.210
<i>and I was the guy</i>

18:32.245 --> 18:33.744
<i>who commandeered
your white board.</i>

18:33.780 --> 18:34.612
Mm-hmm.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.481
"Too much to do,
and not enough time?"

18:36.516 --> 18:39.050
Yeah, that's me.

18:39.085 --> 18:41.853
Well, I hope you're not calling
to get your equation back,

18:41.888 --> 18:43.521
because I erased it.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.089
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

18:45.125 --> 18:46.324
<i>Yeah, no, no, I, um...</i>

18:46.359 --> 18:47.992
well, actually,

18:48.027 --> 18:49.494
I was looking
at your website,

18:49.529 --> 18:51.028
and...

18:51.064 --> 18:53.397
well, let's just say
that, um...

18:53.433 --> 18:55.199
well, I might have been
a bit optimistic

18:55.235 --> 18:57.034
about having everything
under control, so...

18:57.070 --> 18:59.003
Ah, how optimistic?

18:59.038 --> 19:00.004
Extremely?

19:00.039 --> 19:01.539
<i>Hmm, and with the holidays,</i>

19:01.574 --> 19:03.508
you've got a lot more
on your plate right now.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.076
It's more like a platter,

19:05.111 --> 19:06.911
<i>but yeah, that's...</i>

19:06.946 --> 19:08.045
<i>Anyway, I was thinking</i>

19:08.081 --> 19:09.959
<i>that maybe you might have
some time to help me,</i>

19:09.983 --> 19:11.349
you know...

19:11.384 --> 19:13.217
get... organized?

19:13.253 --> 19:15.086
Uh, yeah, I've got some time.

19:15.121 --> 19:17.922
How about, um, tomorrow morning?
Say, 9,30?

19:17.957 --> 19:19.957
That would be great.

19:19.993 --> 19:20.958
Uh, good.
Just text me your address.

19:20.994 --> 19:21.959
<i>Absolutely,</i>

19:21.995 --> 19:22.960
and, uh...

19:22.996 --> 19:24.095
thank you, Lydia.

19:24.130 --> 19:26.597
<i>This is, um...</i>

19:26.633 --> 19:28.566
Thank you.

19:28.601 --> 19:29.767
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

19:29.802 --> 19:31.836
Yeah, yeah,
I'll see you tomorrow.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.438
Thank you.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.355
Lydia, I am so sorry.

19:51.391 --> 19:54.125
I wanted
to get back here and clean up

19:54.160 --> 19:54.959
before you got here,

19:54.994 --> 19:56.272
but I couldn't find
Thomas's gloves,

19:56.296 --> 19:58.229
Am' needed help
with her lines,

19:58.264 --> 19:59.608
and I had to drop them
both off at school,

19:59.632 --> 20:00.531
and my brother, he thinks

20:00.567 --> 20:01.810
the per-unit cost
on the range extender...

20:01.834 --> 20:03.401
Robert.
Take a deep breath.

20:08.608 --> 20:09.574
Would you like to come in?

20:09.609 --> 20:10.942
Sure.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.510
Okay.

20:12.545 --> 20:14.478
Oh, key's
in the car.

20:22.255 --> 20:25.022
Like I said, it's just
been a crazy morning.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.258
It's okay, Robert.
I'm here to help.

20:27.293 --> 20:29.293
So, uh...

20:29.329 --> 20:30.194
how bad is it?

20:30.230 --> 20:31.195
No, you're asking
the wrong question.

20:31.231 --> 20:34.799
See, you should be asking,
where do we start?

20:34.834 --> 20:36.734
Okay...
where do we start?

20:38.404 --> 20:42.473
Well, first, tell me
about your goals.

20:42.508 --> 20:45.309
My goals... um...

20:45.345 --> 20:46.544
Well, I'm a single dad,

20:46.579 --> 20:49.080
and I've just been
so busy at work,

20:49.115 --> 20:50.759
that I've really dropped
the ball with my kids,

20:50.783 --> 20:52.583
and lately,
it just keeps getting worse.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.096
Well, it's a huge step
in realizing that.

20:54.120 --> 20:56.287
So, less work, more
time with your kids

20:56.322 --> 20:57.421
is a great goal.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.290
I can help you with that.

20:59.325 --> 21:00.258
Anything else?

21:00.293 --> 21:02.260
Well, I have
an important potential client

21:02.295 --> 21:04.228
coming to dinner
on December 23rd.

21:04.264 --> 21:06.664
That's, uh, 12 days,

21:06.699 --> 21:09.567
and, uh...

21:09.602 --> 21:12.003
so do you always write
everything down?

21:12.038 --> 21:13.804
Lesson number one
in organizing...

21:13.840 --> 21:15.806
write it down.

21:15.842 --> 21:17.642
So should I write that down?

21:17.677 --> 21:19.443
Can't hurt.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.012
So how long have
you been doing this?

21:21.047 --> 21:22.947
Uh, about four years.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.115
What, were you,
like, tired

21:24.150 --> 21:25.261
of all your
disorganized friends

21:25.285 --> 21:26.317
being late all the time?

21:26.352 --> 21:29.587
Actually, I've always been
a very meticulous person,

21:29.622 --> 21:31.055
even when I was
a little girl.

21:32.058 --> 21:33.858
Right. Uh, well, so,

21:33.893 --> 21:36.627
this, this client is
visiting the office,

21:36.663 --> 21:37.762
and then he's coming here

21:37.797 --> 21:38.941
for a very special
holiday dinner,

21:38.965 --> 21:42.500
which is why it's important
that it goes really well.

21:42.535 --> 21:44.135
What do you do?

21:44.170 --> 21:46.103
Oh, I, um...
I'm a toymaker.

21:46.139 --> 21:46.971
I make toys.

21:47.006 --> 21:48.472
Really? Huh!

21:48.508 --> 21:50.041
Look, uh...

21:50.076 --> 21:52.176
Rudolf, say hello
to the nice lady.

21:52.211 --> 21:53.411
<i>Hello to the nice lady!</i>

21:54.380 --> 21:55.346
Wow!

21:55.381 --> 21:56.614
That is really cool.

21:56.649 --> 21:57.715
Thanks.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.061
Yeah, my brother and I,
we own a small toy company.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.818
Trent Brothers Toys!

22:00.853 --> 22:02.153
Oh, I've seen that shop
downtown.

22:02.188 --> 22:03.854
Yeah, yeah, that's us.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.067
We're trying to get our toys
into Hennessey's.

22:05.091 --> 22:06.691
That's the client
who's coming to dinner.

22:06.726 --> 22:08.159
Which is why this
is so important.

22:09.362 --> 22:11.095
Sounds like you
called me just in time.

22:13.900 --> 22:17.668
Now, onto the first order
of business...

22:17.704 --> 22:19.537
"The secret
to every busy life

22:19.572 --> 22:21.038
is organization."

22:21.074 --> 22:22.406
See? I was listening.

22:22.442 --> 22:23.808
Listening is one thing.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.644
Figuring out how to do it
is another.

22:26.679 --> 22:29.580
So dinner is on the 23rd,

22:29.615 --> 22:31.575
and that's 12 days from now.
It's very manageable.

22:32.785 --> 22:33.818
I'm glad you think so.

22:33.853 --> 22:37.355
Well, it's manageable
with my "Three-C System."

22:37.390 --> 22:39.690
Contain. Concentrate. Control.

22:39.726 --> 22:42.526
Control. Now, I like
the sound of that one.

22:42.562 --> 22:43.527
So when can you start?

22:43.563 --> 22:45.262
Well, it's "we," actually,

22:45.298 --> 22:47.198
'cause it's your life
we're organizing.

22:47.233 --> 22:49.333
But I'm the one
who made the mess.

22:49.369 --> 22:51.435
Well, you're about to learn
how to unmake it.

22:51.471 --> 22:53.204
All right. Boom.

22:59.078 --> 23:01.545
Trash...

23:01.581 --> 23:03.013
Recycle...

23:03.049 --> 23:04.382
Give away.

23:04.417 --> 23:06.751
Any questions?
'Kay.

23:06.786 --> 23:08.085
We're going to start
in here.

23:09.155 --> 23:11.088
So... let's see.

23:11.124 --> 23:12.690
Family game drawer.

23:12.725 --> 23:14.859
Oh, great.
Well, every family has one.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.528
I'm an awesome checkers player,
by the way,

23:17.563 --> 23:19.263
in case you were wondering.

23:19.298 --> 23:20.698
And a junk drawer.

23:20.733 --> 23:21.866
Also very normal.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.033
Every house has one.

23:24.003 --> 23:25.302
'Kay...

23:25.338 --> 23:26.303
Uh...

23:26.339 --> 23:27.571
that's the drawer
for the junk

23:27.607 --> 23:29.007
that doesn't fit
in the junk drawer.

23:30.109 --> 23:32.243
Mm-hmm, and...

23:32.278 --> 23:33.477
that...

23:33.513 --> 23:34.545
oh...

23:35.782 --> 23:36.747
We never open that drawer.

23:36.783 --> 23:38.349
Right.

23:39.452 --> 23:41.118
Okay. So...

23:42.422 --> 23:43.654
I'll start in here,

23:43.689 --> 23:46.991
and why don't you start
out here?

23:47.026 --> 23:48.993
You, um, you know, you're
having a holiday dinner.

23:49.028 --> 23:52.062
We should focus on
your Christmas cheer,

23:52.098 --> 23:53.208
and that starts
with the tree.

23:53.232 --> 23:55.733
We kind of have our own system
for decorating the tree.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.112
It's a lot of fun,
and the kids love it.

23:57.136 --> 23:58.803
And I want to hear
all about that.

23:58.838 --> 24:00.416
Once you try my way,
I know you'll be very happy...

24:03.543 --> 24:04.809
I should... yeah.

24:04.844 --> 24:05.876
Sure.

24:07.547 --> 24:08.979
Ugh...

24:10.049 --> 24:11.015
Are you writing
that down, too?

24:11.050 --> 24:12.283
Just a quick note.

24:12.318 --> 24:13.318
Problem?

24:14.654 --> 24:15.686
I forgot about a meeting,

24:15.721 --> 24:17.655
and I'm never going to make it
downtown in time.

24:17.690 --> 24:19.824
So why don't you Skype in
from here?

24:21.127 --> 24:22.092
Of course, yeah.
I can do that.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.494
Yeah, that'll work.

24:23.529 --> 24:24.795
Okay, well, go ahead.

24:24.831 --> 24:26.363
I'll press on in here.

24:26.399 --> 24:28.032
Okay, great...

24:28.067 --> 24:29.033
but you know what?

24:29.068 --> 24:30.701
Do...
do you see what I mean?

24:30.736 --> 24:32.636
I mean, even when I try
to get organized,

24:32.672 --> 24:34.104
I just mess things up.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.006
Life is messy, Robert,

24:36.042 --> 24:37.119
especially
one as busy as yours,

24:37.143 --> 24:38.976
but don't worry.

24:39.011 --> 24:40.744
We're going to do this
one step at a time.

24:41.647 --> 24:42.647
Thanks.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.851
Uh, yep.
Going to...

25:10.610 --> 25:11.375
You know, with this,

25:11.410 --> 25:13.077
it's like
I'm practically there,

25:13.112 --> 25:15.813
just a bit bigger
and more ominous.

25:15.848 --> 25:16.780
Okay, okay, fine,

25:16.816 --> 25:18.883
but no skipping out
during the boring parts

25:18.918 --> 25:19.884
like last time.

25:19.919 --> 25:20.885
<i>Who, me?</i>

25:21.787 --> 25:23.220
It's a good thing
you're my brother.

25:23.256 --> 25:24.566
I'm going to turn it over
to Garrett now.

25:24.590 --> 25:26.223
<i>- Hey, Garrett.</i>
<i>- </i> Hey.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.495
Sorry.

25:31.531 --> 25:32.875
Took a little longer
than I expected,

25:32.899 --> 25:34.832
but it was productive
and...

25:34.867 --> 25:36.500
Good.

25:36.536 --> 25:37.701
What did you do?

25:37.737 --> 25:40.371
Oh, um,
it's my tried-and-true system.

25:40.406 --> 25:42.540
It's called
"Cluster, not Clutter,"

25:42.575 --> 25:43.541
and, you know,

25:43.576 --> 25:44.408
I just wanted
to give it

25:44.443 --> 25:45.554
a little more
of a Christmas theme.

25:45.578 --> 25:46.243
What do you think?

25:46.279 --> 25:48.078
You should have asked me first.

25:49.081 --> 25:50.781
Oh... well, I...

25:50.816 --> 25:51.894
I don't...

25:51.918 --> 25:53.450
Yeah, they just

25:53.486 --> 25:55.286
haven't been moved
in a long time.

25:59.625 --> 26:00.691
Hey, Dad's home!

26:00.726 --> 26:01.692
Hey, guys.

26:01.727 --> 26:04.094
Hi, how was
school, huh?

26:04.130 --> 26:05.963
Whoa,
what happened in here?

26:05.998 --> 26:06.998
This is weird!

26:08.935 --> 26:11.569
Amelia, Thomas...
you remember Lydia.

26:11.604 --> 26:13.404
We met her
at Hennessey's.

26:13.439 --> 26:15.406
Oh, yeah, you're
the professional organizer.

26:15.441 --> 26:16.307
That's me. Hi.

26:16.342 --> 26:17.274
Now,
Lydia's helping me organize

26:17.310 --> 26:19.043
and get ready
for our big holiday dinner.

26:19.078 --> 26:20.044
Look it!

26:20.079 --> 26:21.211
Yeah, I know,
it's, uh...

26:21.247 --> 26:22.446
it's a little different,

26:22.481 --> 26:24.715
but we can put it back
the way it was.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.750
No, no, I like it.

26:26.786 --> 26:29.086
It's sort of like
a snow globe Christmas town.

26:31.958 --> 26:34.091
Well, we made
some good progress today,

26:34.126 --> 26:35.426
so same time tomorrow?

26:36.429 --> 26:37.227
Sure.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.163
'Kay.
Nice to see you guys again.

26:39.198 --> 26:40.230
- Bye!
- Bye.

26:40.266 --> 26:41.231
See you tomorrow.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.600
Bye.

26:52.278 --> 26:53.589
You guys hungry?
Want a little snack?

26:53.613 --> 26:55.479
- Come on.
- Yeah!

27:03.823 --> 27:05.189
Don't you love the way

27:05.224 --> 27:07.057
the snow makes everything
feel so peaceful?

27:07.093 --> 27:09.727
Thought we'd try something
a little different today.

27:09.762 --> 27:10.861
Okay.

27:10.896 --> 27:13.731
I think we got
a little off-track yesterday,

27:13.766 --> 27:15.210
and sometimes,
it's good to step back,

27:15.234 --> 27:16.767
get a little perspective.

27:17.903 --> 27:18.936
"Perspective"?

27:18.971 --> 27:20.471
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

27:20.506 --> 27:22.172
It's going to be good.
Trust me.

27:23.409 --> 27:25.542
So, yesterday,

27:25.578 --> 27:28.946
I told you about
my Three-C System.

27:28.981 --> 27:29.647
Yeah.

27:29.682 --> 27:32.082
Contain. Concentrate. Control.

27:32.118 --> 27:33.228
Right, and we
did pretty good

27:33.252 --> 27:34.718
with contain
and control.

27:34.754 --> 27:35.686
Now today,

27:35.721 --> 27:37.821
we're going to work
on your concentration.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.156
Believe me, I mean,

27:39.191 --> 27:40.791
I spend almost every minute
of every day

27:40.826 --> 27:41.992
concentrating.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.394
You still feel
overwhelmed?

27:44.363 --> 27:45.396
To say the least.

27:46.532 --> 27:48.565
That's because gaining control

27:48.601 --> 27:51.402
means you have to concentrate
on one thing at a time.

27:51.437 --> 27:52.781
Concentrating on
one thing at a time

27:52.805 --> 27:54.772
just leads to everything else
getting messier.

27:54.807 --> 27:56.073
Not necessarily.

27:56.108 --> 27:57.074
I want you to try something.

27:57.109 --> 27:58.642
'Kay?

27:59.812 --> 28:01.779
Now, I want you to look
at that snowman's nose

28:01.814 --> 28:03.847
for one minute.

28:03.883 --> 28:04.648
What?

28:04.684 --> 28:06.316
Don't take your eyes
off that carrot

28:06.352 --> 28:07.985
for 60 seconds,
no matter what.

28:08.020 --> 28:09.820
Okay, you're serious.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.922
Put yourself in
your Focus Box.

28:13.526 --> 28:15.359
Do you have a cute name
for everything?

28:15.394 --> 28:16.293
I like to think

28:16.328 --> 28:18.008
it helps make organizing
a little more fun.

28:20.032 --> 28:20.964
Okay.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.299
I'm in the Focus Box.

28:23.636 --> 28:25.013
If you say
you're in your Focus Box,

28:25.037 --> 28:28.038
then you're not actually
in your Focus Box.

28:28.074 --> 28:29.885
Did anyone ever tell you
you have way too many rules?

28:29.909 --> 28:32.409
Every day.
Now... focus.

28:33.245 --> 28:34.545
All right.

28:34.580 --> 28:35.979
Okay.
You ready?

28:36.015 --> 28:37.815
All right.

28:38.818 --> 28:39.917
Go.

28:43.723 --> 28:46.924
Oh, four seconds.

28:52.531 --> 28:54.865
That Focus Box is a lot
trickier than it sounds.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.300
Maybe the phone
shouldn't count.

28:58.037 --> 28:59.870
The phone counts.

28:59.905 --> 29:01.371
The cookies count.

29:01.407 --> 29:03.040
The festival play counts.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.708
The Christmas dinner
counts.

29:04.744 --> 29:06.310
Isn't that the problem,
right?

29:06.345 --> 29:08.278
Everything counts.

29:09.415 --> 29:12.182
The snow globes... count.

29:14.353 --> 29:15.552
Robert, it's all right.

29:15.588 --> 29:17.721
No, no...

29:17.757 --> 29:20.758
I'm really sorry,
the way I acted.

29:20.793 --> 29:22.559
Kind of threw me, is all.

29:26.065 --> 29:28.332
The snow globes
belonged to Molly, my wife,

29:28.367 --> 29:29.833
and...

29:29.869 --> 29:33.237
she always arranged them
in the order that she got them.

29:33.272 --> 29:34.716
It was, you know,
it was like a running joke,

29:34.740 --> 29:36.039
since we got married.

29:36.075 --> 29:38.575
Except, uh...

29:38.611 --> 29:41.645
that was the way she left them
before she passed away.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.214
I'm sorry.

29:44.250 --> 29:45.816
How could you know?

29:47.486 --> 29:48.530
All right,
so look...

29:48.554 --> 29:50.921
tell me what it is
that stresses you out the most

29:50.956 --> 29:52.089
about this Christmas dinner.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.091
Oh, well...

29:54.126 --> 29:55.159
other than the fact

29:55.194 --> 29:57.594
that mac and cheese
is a delicacy in our house?

29:58.831 --> 30:00.764
Oh, see,
that's the next step...

30:00.800 --> 30:02.966
finding the right recipe.

30:03.002 --> 30:04.034
Come on.
I'll show you.

30:11.610 --> 30:13.811
You know, I could just pull
a couple of recipes

30:13.846 --> 30:14.878
off the Internet.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.146
Where is the
tradition in that?

30:16.182 --> 30:17.714
What do you mean?

30:17.750 --> 30:19.116
A cookbook, Robert,

30:19.151 --> 30:20.617
one you can keep
for years,

30:20.653 --> 30:22.330
and then everyone looks
forward to the same recipes

30:22.354 --> 30:23.821
every holiday...

30:23.856 --> 30:25.389
not to mention
the memories

30:25.424 --> 30:28.258
that come from every
stained and torn page.

30:28.294 --> 30:29.026
Before you know it,

30:29.061 --> 30:30.071
you will be
teaching your kids

30:30.095 --> 30:33.063
how to make "Dad's Special
Christmas Stuffing."

30:33.098 --> 30:33.964
Huh!

30:33.999 --> 30:34.965
Hadn't really thought of it
that way.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.234
Yeah, there's a lot more
to organizing your life

30:37.269 --> 30:38.902
than just decorating
a house.

30:38.938 --> 30:41.271
Whoa!
Hey, check it out.

30:41.307 --> 30:42.206
Robert.
Focus Box.

30:42.241 --> 30:44.174
When I was a kid,
I had one just like this.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.276
This is the reason
I started making toys.

30:46.312 --> 30:47.277
An astronomy book?

30:47.313 --> 30:48.645
Yeah, yeah...

30:48.681 --> 30:49.646
When I was Thomas's age,

30:49.682 --> 30:51.782
my dad, he gave me a telescope
for Christmas,

30:51.817 --> 30:53.784
and one night,

30:53.819 --> 30:55.430
we got all bundled up,
and we went outside

30:55.454 --> 30:56.186
to look at the Winter Circle.

30:56.222 --> 30:58.121
- The what?
- The Winter Circle.

30:58.157 --> 30:59.434
It's also called
the Winter Hexagon.

30:59.458 --> 31:01.458
It's an asterism.

31:01.493 --> 31:02.871
A lot of people confuse it
with a constellation,

31:02.895 --> 31:03.861
but it's not.

31:03.896 --> 31:05.140
It's a smaller cluster of stars.

31:05.164 --> 31:06.263
Oh, I never knew that.

31:06.298 --> 31:08.198
Yeah.
Anyway, um...

31:08.234 --> 31:11.468
that night, I saw this star
in the Winter Circle

31:11.503 --> 31:13.203
that was so bright,

31:13.239 --> 31:15.038
and my dad told me
it's called Sirius.

31:15.074 --> 31:16.139
The Dog Star.

31:16.175 --> 31:17.140
Yes, you know it!

31:17.176 --> 31:18.075
The Dog Star!

31:18.110 --> 31:19.321
It's the brightest star
in the night sky.

31:19.345 --> 31:20.611
Right, um...

31:20.646 --> 31:22.057
what does this have to do
with toymaking?

31:22.081 --> 31:23.447
Oh!

31:23.482 --> 31:25.449
Right, well,
the Dog Star is, like...

31:25.484 --> 31:27.517
51.6 trillion miles away
from Earth,

31:27.553 --> 31:30.354
and I was seven years old,

31:30.389 --> 31:32.289
so naturally,
I had to go there.

31:32.324 --> 31:33.468
So I figured the only way
I could do that

31:33.492 --> 31:35.325
is if I built
my own rocket ship,

31:35.361 --> 31:36.371
so I started making models

31:36.395 --> 31:37.873
so that eventually,
I could make a real one...

31:37.897 --> 31:40.564
and in the meantime,
my brother, George,

31:40.599 --> 31:42.833
who's, like,
the ultimate salesman,

31:42.868 --> 31:44.635
he starts talking them up
to all our friends,

31:44.670 --> 31:45.847
and then the next thing
you know,

31:45.871 --> 31:48.205
every kid on the block has
a Trent Brothers rocket ship...

31:49.441 --> 31:50.574
and here I am.

31:50.609 --> 31:51.942
And here you are.

31:53.345 --> 31:56.013
Thomas, he's going
to like this for Christmas.

31:56.048 --> 31:57.048
Hey, let's, uh...

31:57.082 --> 31:59.783
let's go find that vegetarian
Christmas cookbook.

32:02.121 --> 32:04.021
The brightest star.

32:14.800 --> 32:15.766
Oh, hey!

32:15.801 --> 32:16.867
Here you go.

32:16.902 --> 32:18.235
Thank you.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.237
So, how's it going
with the new client?

32:20.272 --> 32:22.172
Oh, progressing along.

32:22.207 --> 32:24.174
Progress, like he's listening
and getting it,

32:24.209 --> 32:25.620
or "I can't wait for this
to be over" progress?

32:25.644 --> 32:27.277
Well, you know,

32:27.313 --> 32:29.713
he's a single dad
with two kids he adores,

32:29.748 --> 32:31.581
and he owns
his own business,

32:31.617 --> 32:33.517
and he's got a big
Christmas dinner coming up

32:33.552 --> 32:35.285
for a client...

32:35.321 --> 32:39.056
but I think he would just rather
go to his son's hockey practice

32:39.091 --> 32:40.390
and his daughter's play,

32:40.426 --> 32:43.293
let the rest of the
world fend for itself.

32:43.329 --> 32:44.539
I just think he's feeling
really overwhelmed.

32:44.563 --> 32:46.330
Well, he's lucky
you came along.

32:49.335 --> 32:50.300
Did you know

32:50.336 --> 32:52.936
that the Winter Circle,
where Sirius is located,

32:52.972 --> 32:55.806
is actually an asterism,
and not a constellation.

32:55.841 --> 32:57.607
Where did that come from?

32:57.643 --> 32:58.675
Robert told me.

32:59.979 --> 33:00.911
Oh...

33:00.946 --> 33:03.113
He knows where Sirius is.

33:03.148 --> 33:04.948
That sounds promising.

33:04.984 --> 33:06.750
He's a client, Pam.

33:07.786 --> 33:08.652
And yet here you are,

33:08.687 --> 33:11.388
in your greenhouse,
staring at the stars.

33:12.324 --> 33:13.357
I've got to go.

33:43.622 --> 33:44.699
Bobby?
Didn't you hear me knocking?

33:44.723 --> 33:46.590
Shh...
I'm in my Focus Box.

33:46.625 --> 33:47.791
In your what?

33:48.794 --> 33:50.160
My Focus Box.

33:50.195 --> 33:52.763
My professional organizer
has a "Three-C System,"

33:52.798 --> 33:54.464
and one of the Cs
is Concentrate.

33:55.467 --> 33:57.034
Okay is there seriously
a such a thing

33:57.069 --> 33:58.435
as a professional organizer?

33:58.470 --> 34:00.637
Uh-huh, and her name is Lydia.

34:00.672 --> 34:02.372
Her name is Lydia?

34:02.408 --> 34:04.374
So how long has Lydia been

34:04.410 --> 34:05.810
professionally organizing
your life?

34:07.312 --> 34:08.456
Since you offered my house
to Hennessey

34:08.480 --> 34:09.446
for Christmas dinner.

34:09.481 --> 34:11.313
All right.

34:11.350 --> 34:13.350
So, is she helping?

34:15.420 --> 34:16.464
Yesterday,
we bought a cookbook.

34:16.487 --> 34:19.322
And buying a cookbook
makes you smile like that?

34:20.692 --> 34:21.692
Smile like what?

34:23.328 --> 34:25.228
I'm just saying
that she's helpful, and...

34:25.264 --> 34:26.096
she's coming over later

34:26.130 --> 34:27.308
to help me
straighten up the kitchen.

34:27.331 --> 34:29.476
Any chance she could help you
straighten up your office?

34:29.501 --> 34:32.034
Hennessey can't see it
like this.

34:32.071 --> 34:33.536
Okay, would you just relax?

34:33.572 --> 34:34.772
Everything's going to be fine.

34:38.277 --> 34:39.708
It's the school.

34:39.745 --> 34:41.043
Hello?

34:42.614 --> 34:44.514
Yes, this is
Mr. Trent.

34:45.684 --> 34:46.850
Oh...

34:46.885 --> 34:47.929
Okay, no,
thanks for letting me know.

34:47.953 --> 34:49.719
I'm on my way.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.733
Amelia's at play rehearsal.
She's not feeling well.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.389
I've got to go get her.

34:55.027 --> 34:56.493
Well, uh...

34:56.527 --> 34:58.295
call if you
need anything.

35:03.635 --> 35:05.769
Well, you don't have a fever,
which is good.

35:05.804 --> 35:06.937
How's your tummy feel?

35:06.972 --> 35:08.538
A little better, I guess.

35:08.574 --> 35:10.574
But when you went
to play rehearsal,

35:10.609 --> 35:11.609
it felt kind of weird?

35:13.078 --> 35:14.711
Maybe I'm getting
a cold or something.

35:14.746 --> 35:16.913
You know, if
you get a cold,

35:16.949 --> 35:18.293
you might not be able
to be in the play.

35:18.317 --> 35:20.417
I know.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.319
I'm no doctor,

35:22.354 --> 35:23.787
but I don't think
it's a cold.

35:25.124 --> 35:26.323
What is it?

35:26.358 --> 35:28.436
I think what your sister has
is a bad case of the jitters.

35:28.460 --> 35:29.826
Is it contagious?

35:29.862 --> 35:31.495
Well, it can be,

35:31.530 --> 35:32.996
but in this case,

35:33.031 --> 35:34.498
I think I have
the perfect remedy.

35:34.533 --> 35:36.566
Say this
five times fast.

35:36.602 --> 35:40.036
Kris Kringle climbs countless
Christmas chimneys.

35:41.006 --> 35:42.072
Dad...

35:42.107 --> 35:43.107
No, trust me.
Trust me.

35:43.142 --> 35:45.242
With Mr. Hennessey coming
to Christmas dinner,

35:45.277 --> 35:46.521
it's the only way
I get over my jitters.

35:46.545 --> 35:47.911
- Really?
- Yeah.

35:47.946 --> 35:49.012
Let's say it together.

35:49.047 --> 35:52.249
Kris Kringle climbs
countless Christmas chimneys.

35:52.284 --> 35:54.951
Kris Kringle climbs
countless Christmas chimneys.

35:54.987 --> 35:57.354
Kris Kringle climbs
countless Christmas chimneys!

35:57.389 --> 35:59.322
Kris Kringle climbs
countless Christmas chimneys.

35:59.358 --> 36:00.323
Incoming!

36:01.527 --> 36:03.527
Come on in!
Kringle, Kringle...

36:06.165 --> 36:07.130
Hi!

36:07.166 --> 36:08.965
Lydia!
Lydia, hi!

36:09.001 --> 36:10.311
Oh, Amelia has
a really important role

36:10.335 --> 36:11.067
in the Christmas
Festival play,

36:11.103 --> 36:12.536
and we're just
helping her get over

36:12.571 --> 36:13.681
a slight case
of the jitters.

36:13.705 --> 36:14.671
Oh!

36:14.706 --> 36:16.373
Well, I do know

36:16.408 --> 36:17.307
that it's always better
to be more prepared,

36:17.342 --> 36:20.010
which is why I'm here
to help your dad,

36:20.045 --> 36:24.147
and today
is Operation Kitchen Clutter.

36:24.183 --> 36:25.982
Dad!

36:26.018 --> 36:27.562
You said you were going
to make Christmas cookies

36:27.586 --> 36:29.686
for my party tomorrow.

36:29.721 --> 36:30.487
You know...

36:30.522 --> 36:33.156
there is a cookie
recipe in here

36:33.192 --> 36:35.659
that I used to make every year
with my mom for school,

36:35.694 --> 36:37.861
and what better way
to get over "kitchen jitters"

36:37.896 --> 36:39.563
than to make cookies, right?

36:39.598 --> 36:40.630
Agreed.

36:40.666 --> 36:41.798
Yeah?

36:41.833 --> 36:43.233
To the kitchen!

Cookies!

37:37.589 --> 37:38.722
All right, Dad!

37:38.757 --> 37:40.123
He shoots, he scores!

37:40.158 --> 37:42.025
Prepare the second batch!

37:42.060 --> 37:43.660
Aye-aye, Captain.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.100
Well, thanks
for all your help.

37:50.135 --> 37:50.767
No, thank you.

37:50.802 --> 37:52.068
I actually
can't remember

37:52.104 --> 37:53.737
the last time
I laughed that much.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.450
Although we did fall
a little behind on our schedule.

37:55.474 --> 37:57.374
Well, we'll finish the kitchen
tomorrow,

37:57.409 --> 37:59.943
and then we'll start
on those closets.

37:59.978 --> 38:02.112
Closets?
Oh, I can't wait!

38:02.147 --> 38:03.413
Yeah, see,
that's the spirit.

38:03.448 --> 38:04.492
Hey, that cookbook
you brought...

38:04.516 --> 38:06.916
that's what you were talking
about at the bookstore,

38:06.952 --> 38:08.129
part of your
Christmas traditions?

38:08.153 --> 38:09.163
Yeah,
it belonged to my mother.

38:09.187 --> 38:10.920
A gardener and a cook!

38:10.956 --> 38:12.022
A woman of many talents.

38:12.057 --> 38:13.935
Yeah, it was just her and I
when I was growing up,

38:13.959 --> 38:15.169
and yeah,
I learned a lot from her...

38:15.193 --> 38:17.894
and every torn page,

38:17.929 --> 38:20.930
every spill in that cookbook,

38:20.966 --> 38:22.632
it's just memories
I treasure.

38:22.668 --> 38:24.801
Christmas around your house

38:24.836 --> 38:25.847
must've been
some kind of feast.

38:25.871 --> 38:28.405
Yeah, I used to love
making Christmas dinners.

38:30.309 --> 38:31.741
Not anymore?

38:31.777 --> 38:34.544
Uh, not...
not recently, no.

38:36.315 --> 38:38.415
Oh... I'm sorry.
It's none of my business.

38:39.384 --> 38:40.617
Let's just say

38:40.652 --> 38:43.420
my ex-boyfriend wasn't exactly
the home-for-the-holidays type.

38:43.455 --> 38:45.155
Well... his loss.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.327
Well, I should...

38:50.362 --> 38:51.761
Yeah. Me too.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.266
Night!

39:28.200 --> 39:31.668
"Cookies don't have
to be perfect.

39:31.703 --> 39:35.839
They just have to taste good."

39:37.342 --> 39:39.175
Did you lose a bet?

39:39.211 --> 39:41.911
Hey, that was a gift
from my sweet Aunt Ruth!

39:41.947 --> 39:43.546
What did you ever do to her?

39:43.582 --> 39:44.659
I happen
to be her favorite nephew,

39:44.683 --> 39:45.860
and she'd be very disappointed
if I gave that away.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.484
Well...

39:47.519 --> 39:49.152
you'll still have this one.

39:49.187 --> 39:50.553
Also from Aunt Ruth.

39:51.623 --> 39:53.723
Oh, boy...

39:53.759 --> 39:55.325
Aunt Ruth?

39:55.360 --> 39:56.904
Oh, no, no,
I bought that one for myself.

39:56.928 --> 39:58.528
I love the way
it goes with my eyes.

40:01.299 --> 40:02.665
Daddy?

40:02.701 --> 40:04.367
Hey, sweetie.
What's up?

40:04.403 --> 40:05.301
Um, Dad,

40:05.337 --> 40:07.604
could Lydia help me
clean out my closet?

40:07.639 --> 40:08.438
Oh, honey,
you don't have to...

40:08.473 --> 40:10.340
I'd be happy to.

40:11.309 --> 40:12.342
Okay.

40:18.984 --> 40:20.383
Hmm...

40:22.754 --> 40:24.031
You know, my mom
used to help me pick out

40:24.055 --> 40:25.455
which clothes
to give to charity.

40:25.490 --> 40:27.390
Mine too.

40:27.426 --> 40:29.592
She loved stuff like that.

40:29.628 --> 40:30.794
Sounds like
an amazing person.

40:30.829 --> 40:32.629
She was.

40:32.664 --> 40:34.097
My dad's pretty awesome, too.

40:34.132 --> 40:35.532
It's just...

40:35.567 --> 40:37.233
sometimes...

40:37.269 --> 40:39.369
he forgets a lot,

40:39.404 --> 40:40.937
and he's pretty busy.

40:41.940 --> 40:42.839
Well, that's why I'm here,

40:42.874 --> 40:45.675
so he has more time
for you and Thomas.

40:51.349 --> 40:53.783
When I saw this snow globe
on the piano,

40:53.819 --> 40:55.385
I decided it was my favorite.

40:55.420 --> 40:57.787
My dad gave it to my mom
for Christmas

40:57.823 --> 40:58.755
the year I was born.

40:58.790 --> 41:01.491
She would bring it
to all my school plays,

41:01.526 --> 41:03.126
like a good luck charm,

41:03.161 --> 41:04.961
and I wouldn't get nervous.

41:04.996 --> 41:07.096
And your dad will be
at your play, too,

41:07.132 --> 41:10.233
and I bet that he will bring
that snow globe.

41:11.336 --> 41:12.336
He didn't come last year.

41:12.370 --> 41:14.637
He was working.

41:14.673 --> 41:17.106
I know he feels bad about it.

41:17.142 --> 41:18.541
Please don't say anything.

41:19.678 --> 41:20.977
Don't worry.

41:21.012 --> 41:22.645
He's going to be there...

41:22.681 --> 41:24.781
because you and Thomas
are more important

41:24.816 --> 41:26.136
than anything in the world
to him.

41:27.352 --> 41:28.585
Thanks, Lydia.

41:35.494 --> 41:37.026
So, it's just a prototype,

41:37.062 --> 41:39.629
but I loaded my app
on your phone,

41:39.664 --> 41:41.531
and, now, it makes
a great calendar,

41:41.566 --> 41:43.900
but you can also use it
to set up reminders

41:43.935 --> 41:45.468
for some of your jobs.

41:45.504 --> 41:46.469
Like, I went ahead

41:46.505 --> 41:48.049
and put in some of the things
we talked about,

41:48.073 --> 41:50.406
like...
"organize the closets."

41:50.442 --> 41:51.241
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

41:51.276 --> 41:53.576
So when you are done
with the job,

41:53.612 --> 41:55.378
you check the box,
it moves down,

41:55.413 --> 41:57.113
and the next one
moves into its place.

41:57.148 --> 41:58.581
What do you think?

41:58.617 --> 42:00.517
Looks great.

42:02.087 --> 42:03.786
It's not rocket science,

42:03.822 --> 42:06.256
but it'll help keep you
organized.

42:06.291 --> 42:07.056
I think it's really cool

42:07.092 --> 42:08.958
how it looks
like a checkerboard.

42:08.994 --> 42:10.171
Yeah, that's why
I call it CheckBoard.

42:10.195 --> 42:11.572
You just keep
checking off the boxes.

42:11.596 --> 42:12.940
You really do have
a cute name for everything,

42:12.964 --> 42:13.930
don't you?

42:13.965 --> 42:15.999
The whole purpose
of this...

42:16.034 --> 42:18.468
is to give you
more time for that.

42:23.542 --> 42:25.408
Well then,
I'm going to use it.

42:26.778 --> 42:30.079
"Get Thomas
to hockey practice... now."

42:30.115 --> 42:31.781
That's the idea.

42:33.985 --> 42:36.619
Let's go, guys!
Hockey practice.

42:36.655 --> 42:37.754
Okay, let's go.

42:39.357 --> 42:40.323
I'll see you tomorrow!

42:40.358 --> 42:41.591
- Bye.
- Bye!

42:41.626 --> 42:43.192
Have fun at
the rink, Thomas.

42:43.228 --> 42:44.327
- See ya.
- Bye...

42:44.362 --> 42:47.196
Oh, and we'll have to get
started on that menu tomorrow.

42:47.232 --> 42:48.631
I'll put it on the app...

42:48.667 --> 42:49.677
along with the kids' schedule
for the week.

42:49.701 --> 42:50.733
Okay.

42:53.638 --> 42:55.705
- Uncle George!
- Hi, Uncle George!

42:55.740 --> 42:56.706
- Hey, guys!
- Hi, Uncle George.

42:59.144 --> 43:00.109
Mm!

43:00.145 --> 43:01.844
George, hey.

43:01.880 --> 43:02.890
Lydia, this is
my brother, George.

43:02.914 --> 43:03.880
George,
this is Lydia,

43:03.915 --> 43:05.493
the professional organizer
I told you about.

43:05.517 --> 43:06.482
Nice to meet you.

43:06.518 --> 43:07.684
So...

43:07.719 --> 43:09.063
this is the miracle worker
who's going to save our bacon.

43:09.087 --> 43:11.120
Oh, I don't know about that.

43:11.156 --> 43:13.156
So what's going on?
Everything okay?

43:13.191 --> 43:13.957
Yeah, yeah...

43:13.992 --> 43:15.169
except I'm trying
to put together

43:15.193 --> 43:15.992
this pitch for Hennessey

43:16.027 --> 43:16.826
without
my business partner around.

43:16.861 --> 43:19.295
Thought I'd run
a few ideas past you.

43:19.331 --> 43:20.363
Dad...

43:21.333 --> 43:24.033
Well, I've got to take
Thomas to practice,

43:24.069 --> 43:25.034
and, well, I
promised these guys

43:25.070 --> 43:26.869
that we would skate
to, you know, celebrate

43:26.905 --> 43:27.670
the beginning
of winter break.

43:27.706 --> 43:29.305
Bobby,
this is kind of important.

43:31.843 --> 43:32.976
You could talk at the rink.

43:34.045 --> 43:35.244
I mean...
couldn't you?

43:35.280 --> 43:36.245
That's
a great idea!

43:36.281 --> 43:37.246
What do you say,
Uncle George?

43:37.282 --> 43:38.282
I mean, it's been a while

43:38.316 --> 43:40.316
since you've got to hang out
with these two anyway.

43:40.352 --> 43:41.417
Yeah, sure, sure.

43:41.453 --> 43:43.086
Okay.

43:43.121 --> 43:43.953
I'll meet you there.

43:43.989 --> 43:46.089
See you there.
Okay, get in the car.

43:46.124 --> 43:47.390
Okay...

43:49.060 --> 43:50.994
Hey, Lydia, um...

43:51.029 --> 43:51.995
come with us.

43:52.030 --> 43:52.829
What?

43:52.864 --> 43:54.964
You can help keep me
in that Focus Box.

43:55.967 --> 43:57.066
Sure.

43:57.102 --> 43:58.067
All right,
I'll follow you.

43:58.103 --> 43:59.135
Great.

44:03.975 --> 44:05.875
Pass it over here.
Come on, come on.

44:05.910 --> 44:06.876
Okay, so I've worked out

44:06.911 --> 44:07.710
a whole schedule.

44:07.746 --> 44:08.756
We're going to meet
at the plant,

44:08.780 --> 44:10.458
but I think we should do
a demo of the Santa Sleigh

44:10.482 --> 44:11.781
as soon
as Hennessey gets there.

44:11.816 --> 44:13.416
After that, we can show him
all the toys.

44:13.451 --> 44:14.884
I need a list
from you,

44:14.919 --> 44:16.263
and you just be
your charming self,

44:16.287 --> 44:17.754
and then...
dinner.

44:17.789 --> 44:19.656
How many
are we going to have at dinner?

44:20.659 --> 44:21.624
Bobby,
are you getting this?

44:21.660 --> 44:22.625
Yeah, I've got it, George.

44:22.661 --> 44:23.626
I need you onboard.

44:23.662 --> 44:24.627
Yeah, I'm onboard.

44:24.663 --> 44:25.461
We'll have dinner.

44:25.497 --> 44:26.963
She's a vegetarian.
Don't forget...

44:26.998 --> 44:28.031
Dad! Watch!

44:31.970 --> 44:33.403
Yeah!

44:34.406 --> 44:36.039
That was pretty good.

44:43.348 --> 44:44.247
Hey, nice work, Big Guy.

44:44.282 --> 44:46.049
Yeah, you looked great
out there, Thomas.

44:46.084 --> 44:47.316
Thanks.

44:47.352 --> 44:48.592
Hey, Dad,
can we go skating now?

44:48.620 --> 44:49.952
Yeah, sure, go! Go.

44:49.988 --> 44:52.288
Want to skate with us,
Uncle George?

44:52.323 --> 44:54.590
Like I'd pass up a chance
to show off my Triple Lutz?

44:54.626 --> 44:55.425
I'm in!

44:55.460 --> 44:57.393
Hey, Lydia,
come skating with us!

44:57.429 --> 44:58.494
Uh...

44:58.530 --> 45:01.731
no, I haven't skated
in years.

45:01.766 --> 45:02.565
I've got some work to do.

45:02.600 --> 45:04.734
Wait, wait, no, no.
No more work!

45:04.769 --> 45:05.980
Come on,
let's get you some skates.

45:06.004 --> 45:06.969
She'll be right there.
Come on.

45:07.005 --> 45:08.871
Trust me,
it's fun, it's fun.

45:10.942 --> 45:13.076
You've got to believe me.
It works.

45:13.111 --> 45:15.511
Kris Kringle climbs
countless Christmas chimneys.

45:15.547 --> 45:16.312
It... okay...

45:16.347 --> 45:17.625
it's the third "C"
in your system.

45:17.649 --> 45:18.614
Control.

45:18.650 --> 45:20.416
Trust me, it works!

45:20.452 --> 45:21.417
Just try it.

45:21.453 --> 45:22.518
Okay...

45:22.554 --> 45:27.023
Kris Kringle climbs
countless Christmas chimneys.

45:27.058 --> 45:28.024
Yes!

45:28.059 --> 45:29.092
Hey, okay!

45:29.127 --> 45:30.193
Kris Kringle...

45:30.228 --> 45:31.427
Whoa!

45:31.463 --> 45:32.695
There we go.

45:32.731 --> 45:34.163
Whoosh!

46:04.429 --> 46:05.962
It's...

46:05.997 --> 46:09.532
a complete disaster...

46:09.567 --> 46:10.833
Oh... well...

46:10.869 --> 46:13.770
And absolutely wonderful.

46:15.240 --> 46:17.173
It must feel like Christmas
every day in here.

46:17.208 --> 46:18.908
Yeah, kind of.

46:18.943 --> 46:20.977
You know,
it's just not, um...

46:21.880 --> 46:23.513
so...

46:23.548 --> 46:24.480
Focus Box.

46:24.516 --> 46:26.749
Right? I don't know
how you get anything done.

46:26.785 --> 46:27.750
It's so...

46:27.786 --> 46:29.385
disorganized.

46:29.420 --> 46:31.154
I know where
everything is.

46:31.189 --> 46:32.355
Robert...

46:32.390 --> 46:33.856
Okay, maybe...

46:33.892 --> 46:35.525
maybe you can't see it,

46:35.560 --> 46:37.026
but I mean,
look, I...

46:37.061 --> 46:38.506
I've spent years trying
to get everything

46:38.530 --> 46:40.396
exactly the way
I like it.

46:40.431 --> 46:42.865
And all due respect
to your system...

46:42.901 --> 46:44.867
wouldn't you get
a lot more done

46:44.903 --> 46:48.337
if we just straightened up
a little bit?

46:49.407 --> 46:50.417
Why does everything
always have to be so organized

46:50.441 --> 46:51.207
with you?

46:51.242 --> 46:52.875
Well, I mean...
that's what I do.

46:52.911 --> 46:54.577
Well, maybe everything
doesn't have to fit

46:54.612 --> 46:55.578
into those little squares
of yours.

46:55.613 --> 46:56.613
"Modules."

46:56.648 --> 46:58.447
The point is...

46:58.483 --> 47:00.016
okay.

47:00.051 --> 47:01.729
Let's say I straighten things up
around here.

47:01.753 --> 47:02.819
Great.

47:02.854 --> 47:06.355
Then I would need to keep
everything neat, right?

47:06.391 --> 47:07.701
Uh, yeah, that's
the general idea.

47:07.725 --> 47:10.893
Ah, but if I have
to keep everything neat,

47:10.929 --> 47:12.895
then it's going
to take a lot of time,

47:12.931 --> 47:13.896
which would mean

47:13.932 --> 47:15.476
that I would have less time
to get things done,

47:15.500 --> 47:16.465
wouldn't it?

47:16.501 --> 47:17.900
Okay...

47:17.936 --> 47:21.237
The point of fact is,

47:21.272 --> 47:23.573
I've already organized
my office.

47:23.608 --> 47:24.888
We don't need
to change anything.

47:26.611 --> 47:27.743
You like it like this.

47:27.779 --> 47:29.078
Yes!
I love it!

47:29.113 --> 47:31.747
I mean, when I'm in here,

47:31.783 --> 47:33.160
I get all kinds of ideas
coming at me,

47:33.184 --> 47:34.784
and I feel like
I can build any toy

47:34.819 --> 47:37.486
that a kid
could possibly imagine,

47:37.522 --> 47:39.133
and it doesn't matter
if it's neat or not.

47:39.157 --> 47:40.122
What matters most

47:40.158 --> 47:41.602
is the look on their faces
Christmas morning,

47:41.626 --> 47:43.392
just like
the look on your face

47:43.428 --> 47:45.294
when you walked in here
right now.

47:45.330 --> 47:47.897
I, like... like... like...

47:47.932 --> 47:49.799
okay, yeah,
check this out.

47:52.971 --> 47:54.136
Santa's sleigh.

47:54.172 --> 47:56.772
No...
Santa's Soaring Sleigh.

47:56.808 --> 47:57.840
Watch.

47:57.876 --> 47:59.308
Okay.

48:00.945 --> 48:01.978
Come here.

48:02.013 --> 48:03.312
- Oh.
- Yeah.

48:11.222 --> 48:12.188
You made that?

48:12.223 --> 48:13.923
You like it?

48:17.862 --> 48:19.028
Okay, you're amazing.

48:19.063 --> 48:21.264
So are you.

48:23.134 --> 48:25.034
I... I mean, you just...

48:25.069 --> 48:27.303
you've made
such a difference,

48:27.338 --> 48:29.472
you know,
with organizing the house

48:29.507 --> 48:30.973
and everything.

48:31.009 --> 48:31.974
Thanks.

48:32.010 --> 48:33.509
Hey, uh...

48:33.544 --> 48:35.111
look at this.

48:38.316 --> 48:39.749
Okay...

48:41.886 --> 48:42.685
All right,

48:42.720 --> 48:44.186
all I need you to do
is just clap.

48:44.222 --> 48:45.655
What?

48:45.690 --> 48:46.956
Yeah, clap like
you're at a play

48:46.991 --> 48:48.357
or something.

48:58.937 --> 48:59.902
Every Christmas,

48:59.938 --> 49:01.715
my mother would take me
to see "The Nutcracker,"

49:01.739 --> 49:03.973
and...
my favorite part

49:04.008 --> 49:06.876
was "The Dance
of the Sugar Plum Fairy."

49:18.289 --> 49:19.722
You know,
she always said

49:19.757 --> 49:21.035
that it was because
of ballerinas

49:21.059 --> 49:22.591
that I was probably
the neatest kid

49:22.627 --> 49:23.826
anyone ever saw.

49:23.861 --> 49:27.363
I always wanted everything
just right...

49:27.398 --> 49:31.434
just like at the ballet...
organized.

49:31.469 --> 49:33.402
Mm.

49:33.438 --> 49:35.671
You know...

49:35.707 --> 49:38.074
maybe sometimes,

49:38.109 --> 49:41.544
disorganized
is exactly what you need.

49:59.464 --> 50:00.329
What do you think,

50:00.365 --> 50:02.798
roasted garlic green beans,
or snow peas?

50:02.834 --> 50:03.799
Snow peas.

50:03.835 --> 50:04.800
Done.

50:04.836 --> 50:06.369
Dad?

50:06.404 --> 50:07.436
Yeah, bud?

50:12.410 --> 50:13.542
All aboard.

50:13.578 --> 50:15.211
Let's go!

50:15.246 --> 50:17.446
Go, go, go!
Story time!

50:21.085 --> 50:22.718
Christmas Eve
is almost here,

50:22.754 --> 50:25.321
but there's one big problem.

50:25.356 --> 50:27.990
Santa's Christmas list
of good boys and girls

50:28.026 --> 50:29.058
is missing!

50:30.361 --> 50:31.361
Without that list,

50:31.396 --> 50:33.562
how will Santa know
where to deliver the toys?

50:35.099 --> 50:39.235
And if Santa...
doesn't deliver the toys...

50:39.270 --> 50:40.569
on Christmas...

50:40.605 --> 50:42.538
Can I see?

50:45.376 --> 50:49.612
And if Santa
doesn't deliver the toys

50:49.647 --> 50:53.916
on... Christmas...

50:53.951 --> 50:56.652
and if...

51:16.040 --> 51:18.674
It... looks the same.

51:18.709 --> 51:20.309
I thought you were going
to organize him.

51:22.080 --> 51:23.979
You can't organize creativity,
George.

51:24.015 --> 51:25.181
You can't?

51:25.216 --> 51:26.949
It's spontaneous.

51:26.984 --> 51:29.985
It doesn't come out
neat and controlled.

51:30.021 --> 51:33.355
It's jumbled and exciting
and messy.

51:34.692 --> 51:36.325
This is what Mr. Hennessey
should see.

51:38.262 --> 51:39.962
What she said.

51:42.733 --> 51:44.467
Can you do anything
about him?

51:44.502 --> 51:46.802
Okay, what is that
supposed to mean?

51:46.838 --> 51:47.736
I think he means

51:47.772 --> 51:50.573
that we should add
a little business attire

51:50.608 --> 51:52.875
to your wardrobe.

51:52.910 --> 51:56.078
But this is
my business attire.

51:56.114 --> 51:57.146
I know just the place.

52:01.752 --> 52:03.652
That's nice.
How's that feel?

52:03.688 --> 52:05.521
Like I'm wearing
a straitjacket.

52:05.556 --> 52:06.856
You look nice...

52:06.891 --> 52:09.758
for a guy wearing
a straitjacket.

52:09.794 --> 52:12.995
Why don't we take
a look at some ties?

52:13.030 --> 52:15.364
Okay.

52:17.101 --> 52:19.702
- Hmm...
- Ah, yeah.

52:20.872 --> 52:22.505
Ho, ho, ho?

52:22.540 --> 52:24.740
Um, you know, how about, um,

52:24.775 --> 52:26.842
something like this?

52:28.212 --> 52:29.545
Okay.

52:31.883 --> 52:33.349
A little more subtle?

52:33.384 --> 52:35.551
I like it.
Subtle's good.

52:35.586 --> 52:37.119
<i>Okay, so...</i>

52:37.155 --> 52:38.554
I can glaze the ham

52:38.589 --> 52:40.456
and then soak the cranberries
the night before.

52:40.491 --> 52:41.624
Oh, right, just be sure

52:41.659 --> 52:42.970
and put the cranberries in
first thing,

52:42.994 --> 52:44.693
so they have time to gel.

52:44.729 --> 52:45.761
Right... oh!

52:45.796 --> 52:49.131
There is a market on 16th
that has organic parsnips

52:49.167 --> 52:50.799
for Mrs. Hennessey's
feta loaf.

52:50.835 --> 52:51.734
Feta loaf...

52:51.769 --> 52:52.601
Yeah.

52:52.637 --> 52:54.937
Should my hands
be sweating like this?

52:54.972 --> 52:56.805
You're going
to do fine, Robert.

52:56.841 --> 52:59.074
You know what I need...
I need a test run.

52:59.110 --> 52:59.909
A what?

52:59.944 --> 53:01.877
A test run, like
I do with my toys,

53:01.913 --> 53:03.879
just to work out
all the bugs.

53:03.915 --> 53:05.948
Robert, that's brilliant!

53:05.983 --> 53:07.149
A test run dinner, yeah.

53:07.185 --> 53:09.118
We should do it
tomorrow night,

53:09.153 --> 53:10.586
see what the kids
think of the food.

53:10.621 --> 53:11.921
Actually...

53:11.956 --> 53:13.389
it's pizza
and movie night

53:13.424 --> 53:14.223
with their Uncle George,

53:14.258 --> 53:16.492
so they won't be there,
but, um...

53:16.527 --> 53:17.426
it's kind of
a tradition...

53:17.461 --> 53:19.461
"It's a Wonderful Life."

53:19.497 --> 53:21.797
Well, we could...
have dinner,

53:21.832 --> 53:24.099
just the two of us?

53:25.136 --> 53:26.280
Well, yeah,
a "test run" dinner.

53:26.304 --> 53:28.170
Just to see if you could...

53:28.206 --> 53:30.172
you know, for Hennessey
and the store...

53:30.208 --> 53:31.674
- Yeah. Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

53:31.709 --> 53:32.908
Okay.

53:32.944 --> 53:33.909
All right,
so we're all set.

53:33.945 --> 53:34.945
All set.

53:37.114 --> 53:38.914
Okay, so, um...

53:38.950 --> 53:40.916
so then the parsnips...

53:40.952 --> 53:42.151
I need to let it gel.

53:45.022 --> 53:46.188
So it's not a date?

53:46.224 --> 53:48.290
No. It's business.

53:48.326 --> 53:50.204
So why are you so worried
about what you're wearing?

53:50.228 --> 53:52.795
I'm not worried.
I just, you know...

53:52.830 --> 53:53.796
I'm spending the evening
with him.

53:53.831 --> 53:54.797
I just want to look nice.

53:54.832 --> 53:57.199
Sounds like a...
a date.

53:57.235 --> 53:59.335
Well, it's not,

53:59.370 --> 54:01.114
because I'm good at business,
and I am lousy at dates,

54:01.138 --> 54:04.006
so this is definitely
not a date.

54:04.041 --> 54:05.007
I just know

54:05.042 --> 54:06.475
that as an organized person,

54:06.510 --> 54:08.811
I may not exactly mesh
with someone

54:08.846 --> 54:10.412
who's less organized.

54:11.515 --> 54:12.948
Someone like...

54:12.984 --> 54:14.950
Robert, maybe?

54:14.986 --> 54:16.018
It's not a date!

54:16.053 --> 54:17.987
'Kay.

54:18.022 --> 54:18.988
Sure. Yeah.

54:23.661 --> 54:25.294
Hi.

54:25.329 --> 54:26.295
Hi.

54:26.330 --> 54:28.030
Wow.

54:28.065 --> 54:30.065
You, uh...

54:30.101 --> 54:31.133
you look great.

54:33.237 --> 54:34.797
Well, you clean up
pretty good yourself.

54:36.407 --> 54:37.439
Um...

54:37.475 --> 54:40.175
I got you this centerpiece
for your real dinner.

54:41.946 --> 54:43.712
Well, thanks.

54:48.219 --> 54:49.219
We should...

54:50.755 --> 54:51.787
Yeah...

54:53.958 --> 54:55.758
♪ Deck the halls... ♪

54:55.793 --> 54:57.259
How's this?
Thin enough?

54:57.295 --> 54:59.428
♪ ...With boughs of holly ♪

54:59.463 --> 55:04.566
♪ Fa-la-la-la-la
la-la-la-la... ♪

55:07.071 --> 55:09.204
Now, that smells fantastic!

55:09.240 --> 55:11.273
You're doing
really well.

55:11.309 --> 55:12.574
Okay...

55:13.577 --> 55:14.543
This is nice.

55:14.578 --> 55:16.145
You're doing great.

55:18.616 --> 55:20.382
Well, once Hennessey
tries this meal,

55:20.418 --> 55:21.862
he's going to want more
than just your toys.

55:21.886 --> 55:23.452
He's going to want the recipes.

55:23.487 --> 55:24.920
It was okay?

55:24.955 --> 55:27.089
You did great.

55:27.124 --> 55:28.090
Come on.

55:28.125 --> 55:29.892
Let's take a walk...

55:29.927 --> 55:31.960
work off
some of this great meal.

55:31.996 --> 55:33.307
Sure, yeah.
Just give me a minute.

55:33.331 --> 55:35.364
I'm going to take these
over to the...

55:35.399 --> 55:37.666
These... these'll be here
when we get back.

55:39.136 --> 55:41.537
Okay, let's just do this quick
before I change my mind.

55:41.572 --> 55:42.604
Okay, okay.

55:50.481 --> 55:51.481
Whoo! Okay.

55:53.617 --> 55:54.583
You know what?

55:54.618 --> 55:56.285
You could save a lot of time

55:56.320 --> 55:58.087
if you put the ham
in the oven first...

55:58.122 --> 56:00.756
Just make sure you turn it down
before the feta loaf.

56:00.791 --> 56:02.558
Wait, now who was it
that told me,

56:02.593 --> 56:04.293
"When you're at work,
be at work,

56:04.328 --> 56:05.328
and when you're not..."

56:06.364 --> 56:08.564
I just... I want this dinner
to go so well for you.

56:08.599 --> 56:10.099
I know.
I know you do.

56:10.134 --> 56:13.335
So... what's on
the agenda for tomorrow?

56:13.371 --> 56:16.905
Uh, well, the house
looks pretty good.

56:16.941 --> 56:18.807
Um, dinner was great,

56:18.843 --> 56:20.309
so...

56:20.344 --> 56:24.079
I actually have a meeting
with a new potential client

56:24.115 --> 56:25.581
in the morning.

56:25.616 --> 56:26.749
Oh.

56:26.784 --> 56:29.084
That's good.
I mean, that's great.

56:29.120 --> 56:29.985
Yeah, um...

56:30.020 --> 56:32.087
but, you know,
you should call me any time,

56:32.123 --> 56:33.956
whatever you need, okay?

56:33.991 --> 56:35.357
Okay.
Yeah, thanks.

56:35.393 --> 56:37.326
Okay.

56:37.361 --> 56:39.928
Oh, hey! Tree!

56:39.964 --> 56:41.530
We never decorated it!

56:41.565 --> 56:42.297
I was going to show you
how I do it...

56:42.333 --> 56:43.632
We get to show you
how we do...

56:43.667 --> 56:44.466
You're right.

56:44.502 --> 56:45.934
You're right.

56:45.970 --> 56:47.703
So I guess you have
to come tomorrow.

56:47.738 --> 56:49.004
I guess so.

56:51.675 --> 56:53.642
Oh! It stopped snowing.

56:55.079 --> 56:56.678
Hey, uh...

56:56.714 --> 56:57.546
do you believe in signs?

56:57.581 --> 56:59.348
- Signs?
- Yeah.

56:59.383 --> 57:01.984
Omens.
Portents of the future.

57:02.019 --> 57:02.751
Not especially.

57:02.787 --> 57:05.187
Yeah, me neither...
except...

57:10.227 --> 57:11.760
Sirius.

57:12.930 --> 57:13.896
Yeah.

57:13.931 --> 57:16.932
That's got
to mean something.

57:29.780 --> 57:34.450
Tree
O Christmas tree ♪

57:34.485 --> 57:37.753
♪ Thy leaves
are so unchanging ♪

57:37.788 --> 57:41.423
♪ O Christmas tree
O Christmas tree ♪

57:42.760 --> 57:46.562
♪ Thy leaves
are so unchanging ♪

57:50.100 --> 57:50.833
All right, so,

57:50.868 --> 57:52.534
the secret
to decorating a tree

57:52.570 --> 57:54.636
is getting the order right.

57:54.672 --> 57:59.408
It's lights, garland,
tinsel, and then ornaments.

57:59.443 --> 58:00.375
Well, you know,
we were hoping

58:00.411 --> 58:03.278
to show you our system
for decorating the tree.

58:03.314 --> 58:04.580
Oh, right.

58:04.615 --> 58:05.615
Right, um...

58:05.649 --> 58:06.882
What is that for?

58:06.917 --> 58:08.283
Pin the Ornament
on the Tree!

58:08.319 --> 58:09.551
Pin the Ornament on the what?

58:09.587 --> 58:10.719
You can go first!

58:11.689 --> 58:12.754
Okay...

58:12.790 --> 58:16.158
This kind of sounds
more like a game than a system.

58:16.193 --> 58:17.125
Oh, yeah.

58:17.161 --> 58:19.161
Okay...

58:19.196 --> 58:20.629
♪ O Christmas tree... ♪

58:20.664 --> 58:23.232
- Up there?
- All right, Lydia!

58:23.267 --> 58:25.567
This is a little bit
more fun than my system.

58:25.603 --> 58:26.603
Right?

58:28.672 --> 58:32.674
♪ O Christmas tree
O Christmas tree ♪

58:32.710 --> 58:39.648
♪ You'll ever be unchanging ♪

58:41.519 --> 58:42.651
It's wonderful.

58:46.857 --> 58:48.423
I need to, uh...
oh...

58:48.459 --> 58:50.158
get these guys to sleep.

58:51.128 --> 58:53.195
Yeah, they're
really great kids.

58:53.230 --> 58:55.831
Yeah.
I'm very lucky.

58:55.866 --> 58:57.466
No, luck has nothing
to do with it.

58:57.501 --> 58:59.268
You're an amazing dad.

58:59.303 --> 59:01.069
Well, some days
are better than others.

59:02.239 --> 59:03.071
Well, something tells me

59:03.107 --> 59:05.841
that those days are
pretty hard to beat.

59:09.480 --> 59:11.547
Yeah, I...

59:11.582 --> 59:14.816
I think Amelia's nervous
about... about the play

59:14.852 --> 59:17.252
because...
because I missed it last year.

59:19.056 --> 59:22.457
I was just running
in ten different directions,

59:22.493 --> 59:24.960
and...

59:24.995 --> 59:26.862
I missed it.

59:26.897 --> 59:29.164
I messed up big time,

59:29.199 --> 59:31.466
and Molly, you know, their mom,

59:31.502 --> 59:32.834
she never missed
a performance.

59:32.870 --> 59:33.835
I know.

59:33.871 --> 59:34.937
She told me.

59:36.540 --> 59:37.506
She did?

59:37.541 --> 59:38.541
Mm-hmm.

59:38.576 --> 59:39.541
What'd she say?

59:39.577 --> 59:41.376
Well, she doesn't want
to hurt your feelings,

59:41.412 --> 59:43.912
but she said
that her mom was always there

59:43.948 --> 59:46.715
with a special snow globe
every play for good luck.

59:46.750 --> 59:47.716
Yeah, yeah, she was.

59:47.751 --> 59:50.185
I, I, uh...

59:50.220 --> 59:52.888
I bought it for her
when Amelia was born.

59:54.291 --> 59:55.257
Huh.

59:55.292 --> 59:57.359
It's not here.

59:57.394 --> 59:58.394
Um...

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:02.831
I was...

01:00:02.866 --> 01:00:03.966
It's... it's in her room.

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:08.344
Wonder why she took it
in there?

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:11.440
To remind her
of everything it means to her...

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:14.543
and to you.

01:00:19.316 --> 01:00:21.083
Yeah.

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:05.994
We can't tell you how excited
we are to have you here

01:01:06.030 --> 01:01:07.062
with us, Mr. Hennessey.

01:01:07.097 --> 01:01:10.132
Well, I'm real interested
in seeing your operation.

01:01:11.435 --> 01:01:12.679
You can tell a lot
about a person

01:01:12.703 --> 01:01:16.004
by how they run the show.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.572
Well, this is
the workshop.

01:01:17.608 --> 01:01:20.275
We are all tooled up
to use wood, metal,

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:21.910
3D CAD and printing,

01:01:21.945 --> 01:01:24.613
laser cutters, C&C,
rotocasting...

01:01:24.648 --> 01:01:25.747
You know, fellas,

01:01:25.783 --> 01:01:28.116
I've seen all this before.

01:01:28.152 --> 01:01:30.185
I'm not as interested
in production

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:32.587
as I am in concept...

01:01:32.623 --> 01:01:35.257
design and prototype.

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:41.263
Then follow me, sir.

01:01:53.711 --> 01:01:55.977
Well, this is the brain center
of the company,

01:01:56.013 --> 01:01:57.013
Robert's office.

01:02:09.193 --> 01:02:10.193
I like it.

01:02:12.196 --> 01:02:14.596
These are some of the toys
we're working on.

01:02:17.668 --> 01:02:19.000
And what is this?

01:02:19.036 --> 01:02:21.036
We call that
"The Sugar Plum Fairy."

01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:25.006
Yes, this is...
this is very special to us.

01:02:46.196 --> 01:02:50.265
My wife loves the ballet
and ballerinas.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.768
It's very clever.

01:02:52.803 --> 01:02:53.902
Remind me

01:02:53.937 --> 01:02:55.403
to tell Sheila about this.

01:02:55.439 --> 01:02:57.205
Oh, I will.

01:02:57.241 --> 01:02:59.407
And what is this?

01:02:59.443 --> 01:03:00.876
That...

01:03:00.911 --> 01:03:03.678
that is Santa's Soaring Sleigh.

01:03:03.714 --> 01:03:05.614
And we're sure

01:03:05.649 --> 01:03:07.227
this will be your best-seller
next Christmas.

01:03:07.251 --> 01:03:09.217
The remote control
will be your mobile device.

01:03:09.253 --> 01:03:10.552
This is the prototype.

01:03:10.587 --> 01:03:12.521
- May I?
- Please.

01:03:17.327 --> 01:03:18.371
And with
the added range extender,

01:03:18.395 --> 01:03:20.695
the sleigh can go higher,
it can travel further,

01:03:20.731 --> 01:03:22.864
and it can do
a lot more tricks.

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:24.077
Maybe Mr. Hennessey'd
like to try it?

01:03:24.101 --> 01:03:25.901
Oh, sure, absolutely.

01:03:25.936 --> 01:03:28.236
No, it looks...
It looks a little complicated.

01:03:28.272 --> 01:03:29.649
My favorite toys
were always the ones

01:03:29.673 --> 01:03:31.439
that I could move myself.

01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:32.607
Oh, it's a lot of fun.

01:03:32.643 --> 01:03:33.742
And remote-controlled
drones

01:03:33.777 --> 01:03:35.377
are very hot right now.

01:03:35.412 --> 01:03:36.311
Well, when you've been
in the business

01:03:36.346 --> 01:03:37.312
as long as I have,

01:03:37.347 --> 01:03:39.080
you learn that hot
can turn cold

01:03:39.116 --> 01:03:41.049
real quick.

01:03:43.854 --> 01:03:46.454
So...

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:48.824
what else do you have?

01:03:48.859 --> 01:03:50.425
That's the big surprise.

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:51.471
We were saving it
to show you

01:03:51.495 --> 01:03:52.460
at dinner
tomorrow night.

01:03:52.496 --> 01:03:53.461
- Oh?
- Yes, sir,

01:03:53.497 --> 01:03:55.341
and when you see
what Robert's got up his sleeve,

01:03:55.365 --> 01:03:57.299
you're not going
to believe it!

01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:59.301
Well...
I hope so.

01:04:01.371 --> 01:04:03.171
Yeah!

01:04:03.207 --> 01:04:04.973
I'm looking forward to it.

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:08.009
Why would you tell him that?

01:04:08.045 --> 01:04:09.189
I'm all out of tricks, George.

01:04:09.213 --> 01:04:10.645
I've got nothing left
up my sleeve.

01:04:10.681 --> 01:04:11.758
There must be something
you can do here

01:04:11.782 --> 01:04:12.480
before tomorrow night.

01:04:12.516 --> 01:04:13.481
Yeah, I can cook
Christmas dinner

01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:15.750
and hope he changes his mind
over a full stomach.

01:04:15.786 --> 01:04:17.252
We had him, too!

01:04:17.287 --> 01:04:18.331
Did you see
the look on his face

01:04:18.355 --> 01:04:20.188
when he saw that
ballerina dancing?

01:04:20.224 --> 01:04:22.424
And Lydia was absolutely right
about your office, too.

01:04:22.459 --> 01:04:23.258
Oh, well then, maybe
we should call Lydia

01:04:23.293 --> 01:04:25.293
and see if she has
any more brilliant...

01:04:25.329 --> 01:04:26.928
Ideas.

01:04:30.667 --> 01:04:31.633
What?

01:04:31.668 --> 01:04:33.768
What was it that Hennessey said
he liked most

01:04:33.804 --> 01:04:34.804
about his favorite toys?

01:04:36.006 --> 01:04:37.246
The ones he could move himself.

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:39.774
Yeah...

01:04:39.810 --> 01:04:41.343
and he's a family man.

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:45.013
You're smiling.
Why are you smiling?

01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:46.948
Is that good?

01:04:46.984 --> 01:04:48.850
Maybe.

01:05:04.434 --> 01:05:05.300
Lydia, hi!

01:05:05.335 --> 01:05:06.534
Hi.

01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:08.303
I'm sorry to just
stop by like this,

01:05:08.338 --> 01:05:09.916
but I wanted to see
how your meeting went.

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:12.474
Uh... yeah, you know,
jury's still out,

01:05:12.509 --> 01:05:13.541
but I think

01:05:13.577 --> 01:05:14.687
the Christmas dinner's
going to be the big test.

01:05:14.711 --> 01:05:16.344
Oh, well, in that case,

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:17.312
you've got nothing
to worry about.

01:05:17.347 --> 01:05:18.747
Well, thanks.

01:05:18.782 --> 01:05:19.547
Come on in for a second.

01:05:19.583 --> 01:05:21.416
No, I'm actually running
some errands

01:05:21.451 --> 01:05:22.717
for the new client,

01:05:22.753 --> 01:05:24.319
but I wanted
to give you this.

01:05:24.354 --> 01:05:25.921
What?

01:05:25.956 --> 01:05:27.055
For Christmas...

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:29.891
and to say thank you...
for the job.

01:05:29.927 --> 01:05:31.559
You have to open it,
though,

01:05:31.595 --> 01:05:32.527
before your big dinner.

01:05:32.562 --> 01:05:34.162
Okay, yeah.
I will.

01:05:34.197 --> 01:05:35.864
Bobby, let's go!

01:05:35.899 --> 01:05:37.365
Oh, hi, Lydia.

01:05:37.401 --> 01:05:39.034
Come on,
little brother.

01:05:39.069 --> 01:05:40.346
We've still got
a lot of work to do.

01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:41.370
I'll be right there.

01:05:42.706 --> 01:05:43.738
You're working?

01:05:43.774 --> 01:05:44.839
Yeah.

01:05:44.875 --> 01:05:46.419
Looks like we're going
to be at it all night, too.

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:48.009
Come on in for a second.

01:05:48.045 --> 01:05:48.910
I'll show you
what we're doing.

01:05:48.946 --> 01:05:49.946
That's... that's good.

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:50.946
Go ahead.
Get back to work.

01:05:50.981 --> 01:05:52.013
It's obviously important.

01:05:53.216 --> 01:05:54.216
What's wrong?

01:05:57.621 --> 01:05:58.920
You know, I...

01:05:58.956 --> 01:06:02.023
I just thought that maybe,

01:06:02.059 --> 01:06:03.091
after everything you did

01:06:03.126 --> 01:06:04.637
to find the right balance,
between home and work...

01:06:04.661 --> 01:06:06.261
I thought that

01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:07.729
you would stick with it,

01:06:07.764 --> 01:06:08.897
at least for the holidays.

01:06:08.932 --> 01:06:10.465
No, wait a second...

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:11.433
No, no, it's okay.

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:13.401
Really, I've...
been down this road before.

01:06:13.437 --> 01:06:15.303
Road?
What do you mean, a road?

01:06:15.339 --> 01:06:17.038
What?

01:06:17.074 --> 01:06:19.474
He wasn't a client,
but it turned out the same.

01:06:19.509 --> 01:06:21.576
He was always talking about...

01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:22.755
leaving work at the office,
you know,

01:06:22.779 --> 01:06:25.213
but when push
came to shove,

01:06:25.248 --> 01:06:27.615
it was always
about the work, 24-7.

01:06:27.651 --> 01:06:29.150
Wait, you don't understand.
We're...

01:06:29.186 --> 01:06:31.219
But I do.

01:06:31.254 --> 01:06:33.188
Take care.

01:06:34.624 --> 01:06:35.757
Wait, Lydia.
Hold on...

01:07:15.766 --> 01:07:17.599
Looking good, looking good.

01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:28.376
Table set.

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:38.586
Okay, go see
who it is!

01:07:42.526 --> 01:07:43.526
Uncle George!

01:08:12.189 --> 01:08:13.488
They're here!

01:08:17.694 --> 01:08:19.127
Hello, hello!

01:08:19.162 --> 01:08:20.627
Come in.
Welcome!

01:08:20.663 --> 01:08:22.130
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:08:22.165 --> 01:08:23.031
Please, let me
take your coats.

01:08:23.066 --> 01:08:24.866
Thank you.
Robert, George,

01:08:24.901 --> 01:08:26.334
this is my wife, Sheila.

01:08:26.368 --> 01:08:28.314
Honey, these are the fellas
I was telling you about.

01:08:28.337 --> 01:08:29.270
Mrs. Hennessey.

01:08:29.305 --> 01:08:32.207
Sheila, please.
It's so nice to meet you both.

01:08:32.242 --> 01:08:33.341
It's a pleasure.

01:08:33.376 --> 01:08:35.154
Oh, this is my daughter, Amelia.
That's my son, Thomas.

01:08:35.178 --> 01:08:36.678
Hi. Nice to meet you.

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:38.046
Yeah, come in.

01:08:38.081 --> 01:08:39.881
Oh, your house
is just lovely,

01:08:39.916 --> 01:08:41.549
and so Christmas-y!

01:08:41.585 --> 01:08:42.550
Thank you!

01:08:42.586 --> 01:08:47.154
Oh, and what a beautiful
poinsettia centerpiece.

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:48.656
Our friend, Lydia,
gave it to us.

01:08:48.692 --> 01:08:49.657
She grows them herself.

01:08:49.693 --> 01:08:50.892
Does she?

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:53.228
Well, that makes it
a very special gift.

01:08:53.263 --> 01:08:54.328
Yes, sure does.

01:08:54.363 --> 01:08:56.997
Please, come in.
Take a seat.

01:09:02.104 --> 01:09:03.738
Thank you for helping out.

01:09:03.773 --> 01:09:04.706
This is the only chance
I've had

01:09:04.741 --> 01:09:07.274
to wrap Eric's presents
when he wasn't around.

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:08.343
Aw, sure.

01:09:09.613 --> 01:09:11.011
So, did Robert
like the tie?

01:09:11.046 --> 01:09:12.212
He liked it at the store.

01:09:12.249 --> 01:09:14.015
You didn't hang around
to find out?

01:09:14.050 --> 01:09:15.015
No, he was busy.

01:09:15.051 --> 01:09:17.886
He was doing some work
at home.

01:09:17.921 --> 01:09:20.488
He was working at the house
the day before his big dinner?

01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:23.390
Yeah, um...

01:09:23.426 --> 01:09:25.292
you know,
shouldn't we get moving on this?

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:26.968
'Cause Eric's going
to be home any minute.

01:09:28.665 --> 01:09:30.932
I'm surprised Robert
didn't invite you to the dinner,

01:09:30.966 --> 01:09:32.100
the way you two hit it off.

01:09:32.135 --> 01:09:33.968
He's a client, Pam.

01:09:34.004 --> 01:09:37.037
I was hired to help him
spend more time with his kids

01:09:37.073 --> 01:09:39.040
and get ready for a big
business dinner tonight.

01:09:39.075 --> 01:09:41.075
What he does with that help
is up to him.

01:09:41.111 --> 01:09:41.910
The job is over.

01:09:41.944 --> 01:09:43.711
Right, check it off the app,
move on.

01:09:43.747 --> 01:09:44.957
- Exactly.
- Yeah, sure, I mean,

01:09:44.981 --> 01:09:46.792
why would you have feelings
about it one way or the other?

01:09:46.816 --> 01:09:50.151
I mean, just because
he's smart, funny...

01:09:50.187 --> 01:09:51.486
definitely easy on the eyes...

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.886
I know what you're doing.

01:09:52.923 --> 01:09:55.056
The question is,
do you know what you're doing?

01:09:56.193 --> 01:09:58.660
I was hired
to organize his life,

01:09:58.695 --> 01:09:59.661
not get involved in it.

01:09:59.696 --> 01:10:00.962
Are you involved?

01:10:06.469 --> 01:10:08.570
You know,
for almost two weeks,

01:10:08.605 --> 01:10:09.904
I've seen him every day.

01:10:11.074 --> 01:10:12.585
We've spent all this time
getting to know each other,

01:10:12.609 --> 01:10:13.609
and...

01:10:15.879 --> 01:10:18.179
last night,
all I could think was...

01:10:18.215 --> 01:10:20.481
"I don't want it to end
because the job is over."

01:10:22.185 --> 01:10:23.618
I was kind of getting used

01:10:23.653 --> 01:10:25.286
to all the confusion
and the chaos...

01:10:27.123 --> 01:10:29.257
maybe even enjoying it
a little bit...

01:10:30.627 --> 01:10:32.093
his messy office,

01:10:32.128 --> 01:10:35.430
decorating the tree
with a blindfold,

01:10:35.465 --> 01:10:37.565
walking together in the snow...

01:10:38.702 --> 01:10:40.902
That sounds pretty good to me.

01:10:42.706 --> 01:10:45.506
Yeah, then he was working
like nothing had changed.

01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:48.343
Trust me.

01:10:48.378 --> 01:10:50.044
Whatever that was...

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:51.212
everything's changed,

01:10:51.248 --> 01:10:53.514
for both of you.

01:11:01.391 --> 01:11:03.224
That was delicious.

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:05.193
Robert, you are a man
of many talents.

01:11:05.228 --> 01:11:07.061
Thank you, sir.
I'm happy you enjoyed it.

01:11:07.097 --> 01:11:09.297
I did have a lot of help
from these two.

01:11:09.332 --> 01:11:10.298
And from Lydia!

01:11:10.333 --> 01:11:11.866
And from Lydia.

01:11:11.901 --> 01:11:13.145
You know,
when we invited you

01:11:13.169 --> 01:11:15.970
to share part of your holiday
with us,

01:11:16.006 --> 01:11:18.172
it was because we wanted you
to see for yourselves

01:11:18.208 --> 01:11:20.842
exactly how important
family is to us,

01:11:20.877 --> 01:11:22.477
especially this time of year.

01:11:22.512 --> 01:11:24.479
Well, we couldn't
agree with you more.

01:11:24.514 --> 01:11:28.049
Robert's kids are the most
important part of his life,

01:11:28.084 --> 01:11:29.751
and he's taken that love,

01:11:29.786 --> 01:11:33.454
and he's put it at the heart
of Trent Brothers Toys.

01:11:35.025 --> 01:11:37.692
Young man,
you have my undivided attention.

01:11:39.562 --> 01:11:40.928
Thank you, George.

01:11:40.964 --> 01:11:42.397
Well, Mr. Hennessey,

01:11:42.432 --> 01:11:43.398
as you've seen
for yourself,

01:11:43.433 --> 01:11:46.200
many of our toys have
all the bells and whistles

01:11:46.236 --> 01:11:47.935
you could possibly imagine.

01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:51.906
They fly, they talk,
they dance...

01:11:51.941 --> 01:11:53.107
but sometimes,

01:11:53.143 --> 01:11:56.411
all of that just gets in the way
of what really matters...

01:11:57.747 --> 01:11:58.891
and sometimes,
all you really want

01:11:58.915 --> 01:12:02.383
is a game that you can play
with family and friends...

01:12:02.419 --> 01:12:04.619
one you move
around yourself,

01:12:04.654 --> 01:12:07.722
which is what the newest toy
from the Trent family

01:12:07.757 --> 01:12:08.990
is all about.

01:12:11.561 --> 01:12:14.495
We call it
the Family Game Drawer.

01:12:17.767 --> 01:12:21.202
Everybody's favorites,
conveniently in one place.

01:12:21.237 --> 01:12:23.738
Well, an impressive use
of technology,

01:12:23.773 --> 01:12:25.506
but we have
family game board boxes.

01:12:38.321 --> 01:12:39.520
What?

01:12:40.457 --> 01:12:41.956
Isn't that clever?

01:12:43.593 --> 01:12:45.393
Well, I'll be.

01:12:45.428 --> 01:12:46.928
It's compact,

01:12:46.963 --> 01:12:48.563
it's portable,

01:12:48.598 --> 01:12:51.299
and it holds
11 different board games.

01:12:52.836 --> 01:12:53.836
Thomas?

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.573
May I?

01:12:58.608 --> 01:12:59.774
Yes, please.

01:13:01.044 --> 01:13:02.110
Well...

01:13:02.145 --> 01:13:03.978
we do love board games.

01:13:04.848 --> 01:13:06.147
So do we.

01:13:06.182 --> 01:13:09.183
Mr. Hennessey,
I started making toys

01:13:09.219 --> 01:13:11.486
because...
they inspired my imagination.

01:13:11.521 --> 01:13:13.654
And I've kept making toys

01:13:13.690 --> 01:13:15.523
because, well...

01:13:15.558 --> 01:13:16.657
there's nothing better

01:13:16.693 --> 01:13:18.559
than watching someone's
face light up.

01:13:19.796 --> 01:13:21.396
That's what special toys do.

01:13:28.171 --> 01:13:30.438
People shop at my stores

01:13:30.473 --> 01:13:32.673
because they know
I'll see to it

01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:35.176
that they find what they want,
and what they need,

01:13:35.211 --> 01:13:36.477
and a big part of that

01:13:36.513 --> 01:13:39.347
is being in business
with the right people.

01:13:41.584 --> 01:13:42.617
As far as I can see,

01:13:42.652 --> 01:13:46.120
Trent Brothers Toys
is a mighty fine combination

01:13:46.156 --> 01:13:49.757
of tradition and innovation...

01:13:55.365 --> 01:13:56.264
I would be proud

01:13:56.299 --> 01:13:57.859
to go into business
with you two fellas.

01:13:58.935 --> 01:13:59.901
Thank you, sir.

01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:01.369
Thank you.

01:14:01.404 --> 01:14:02.837
Thank you so much.

01:14:05.008 --> 01:14:06.908
That's, that's
what I was telling you about.

01:14:06.943 --> 01:14:08.543
Oh, it's adorable!

01:14:24.694 --> 01:14:26.527
Oh...

01:14:26.563 --> 01:14:27.728
Uh...

01:14:51.254 --> 01:14:52.631
All right,
my little bookworm.

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:54.033
Time to go to bed.
You've got a big day tomorrow.

01:14:54.057 --> 01:14:55.057
Yeah.

01:14:56.559 --> 01:14:58.392
Hey, listen,
by the way,

01:14:58.428 --> 01:14:59.605
thank you so much
for your help tonight.

01:14:59.629 --> 01:15:01.195
It was a huge success.

01:15:01.231 --> 01:15:03.097
Yeah, no problem.

01:15:05.335 --> 01:15:06.367
You okay?

01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:08.703
Yeah, I guess.

01:15:15.645 --> 01:15:16.744
I miss Mom,
too, honey.

01:15:19.616 --> 01:15:21.616
I just wish she would be here
to see my play.

01:15:22.819 --> 01:15:24.752
Yeah, me too...

01:15:24.787 --> 01:15:27.822
and I know it's hard for you
without her being there,

01:15:27.857 --> 01:15:28.789
and I also know

01:15:28.825 --> 01:15:30.491
you're worried
because I missed last year,

01:15:30.527 --> 01:15:32.207
but I promise you,
I'm going to be there...

01:15:33.963 --> 01:15:35.897
and...

01:15:35.932 --> 01:15:37.465
I think
even if we can't see her...

01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:38.533
Mom will be, too.

01:15:40.136 --> 01:15:41.102
I think so, too.

01:15:41.137 --> 01:15:42.103
Yeah.

01:15:42.138 --> 01:15:45.239
You know, there's
just one problem, though.

01:15:45.275 --> 01:15:46.315
I can't find
the snow globe

01:15:46.342 --> 01:15:47.141
that Mom used
to bring with her.

01:15:47.176 --> 01:15:48.320
You know the one
I'm talking about?

01:15:48.344 --> 01:15:49.610
The Christmas one

01:15:49.646 --> 01:15:51.445
with the little girl
and the fox inside?

01:15:51.481 --> 01:15:52.246
Yeah.

01:15:52.282 --> 01:15:53.180
Yeah, I don't
know where it is,

01:15:53.216 --> 01:15:54.816
and, you know,
I want to bring it, but...

01:15:56.886 --> 01:15:57.852
This one?

01:15:57.887 --> 01:15:59.020
There it is!

01:16:01.491 --> 01:16:02.456
You kept it safe,
didn't you?

01:16:02.492 --> 01:16:04.091
Yep.

01:16:06.462 --> 01:16:07.428
I love you, Dad.

01:16:07.463 --> 01:16:08.543
I love you, too,
sweetheart.

01:16:25.048 --> 01:16:27.214
Oh! Lydia, hi!

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:28.316
Hello. I know you're busy.

01:16:28.351 --> 01:16:29.361
I just wanted
to drop this off.

01:16:29.385 --> 01:16:31.385
Ooh...

01:16:32.855 --> 01:16:34.655
Gingerbread.
My favorite!

01:16:34.691 --> 01:16:35.456
How do I rate?

01:16:35.491 --> 01:16:37.725
It's just my way
of saying thank you

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:38.920
for being
such a great friend.

01:16:39.729 --> 01:16:40.461
By the way...

01:16:40.496 --> 01:16:42.830
my kitchen
is a disaster area.

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.400
And that's good.

01:16:46.436 --> 01:16:48.369
Yes, it is.
I've got to go.

01:16:48.404 --> 01:16:51.205
Merry Christmas!

01:16:55.778 --> 01:16:57.745
Okay, come on, Em!
Your audience awaits!

01:17:03.953 --> 01:17:04.986
Do I look okay?

01:17:05.021 --> 01:17:07.488
Um, who are you?

01:17:07.523 --> 01:17:09.090
Where's Amelia?
Thomas!

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:10.458
How did this elf
get in our house?

01:17:10.493 --> 01:17:11.559
I don't know!

01:17:11.594 --> 01:17:13.094
Dad...

01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:14.129
All right, hey,

01:17:14.163 --> 01:17:15.963
I just need to make
one quick stop on the way.

01:17:34.951 --> 01:17:36.484
Be right back.

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:06.180
Merry Christmas!

01:18:11.821 --> 01:18:13.421
Okay, let's go!

01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:18.860
Wow.

01:18:20.530 --> 01:18:23.164
- Uncle George!
- Uncle George!

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:25.566
Hey, here they are!

01:18:25.601 --> 01:18:26.801
Amelia, you look great!

01:18:26.836 --> 01:18:27.802
Thanks.

01:18:27.837 --> 01:18:29.570
Dad, I've got
to go backstage.

01:18:29.605 --> 01:18:30.749
Right, right. Go, go, go.
You're going to be great.

01:18:30.773 --> 01:18:31.739
You're going to be great.

01:18:31.774 --> 01:18:32.807
Love you.

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.753
Amelia's play!

01:20:10.506 --> 01:20:12.239
Robert, no...

01:20:22.285 --> 01:20:23.818
Hi there!

01:20:23.853 --> 01:20:27.755
I was just getting
Amelia's special snow globe.

01:20:28.891 --> 01:20:30.524
- Hey, I just texted you.
- Oh!

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:32.860
Yeah, I just really
wanted to see you.

01:20:32.895 --> 01:20:34.461
I didn't bring my phone.

01:20:34.497 --> 01:20:35.930
Really?

01:20:35.965 --> 01:20:39.133
Well, it said that we closed
the Hennessey deal!

01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:40.835
What? Congratulations!

01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:42.469
Thanks.

01:20:42.505 --> 01:20:43.470
Oh, the play!

01:20:43.506 --> 01:20:44.538
Yeah, let's go!

01:20:44.574 --> 01:20:46.740
Come on.

01:20:52.315 --> 01:20:57.017
Christmas Eve is almost here,
but we have a big problem!

01:20:57.053 --> 01:20:59.520
Santa's Christmas list
of good boys and girls

01:20:59.555 --> 01:21:00.955
is missing!

01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:01.990
Without that list,

01:21:02.024 --> 01:21:04.825
how will Santa know
where to deliver the toys?

01:21:04.861 --> 01:21:08.329
And if Santa doesn't deliver
the toys on Christmas...

01:21:15.872 --> 01:21:17.438
and...

01:21:25.514 --> 01:21:27.359
And if Santa doesn't deliver
the toys on Christmas,

01:21:27.383 --> 01:21:28.816
there will be
a lot of sad children!

01:21:28.851 --> 01:21:31.652
It's up to us
to find that list!

01:21:31.687 --> 01:21:32.853
Wake up, elves!

01:21:35.958 --> 01:21:36.991
Follow us!

01:21:37.026 --> 01:21:39.860
I'd definitely say this is
a Christmas to remember!

01:21:41.464 --> 01:21:42.875
It's thanks to you
and your "Three-C System,"

01:21:42.899 --> 01:21:44.899
you know...

01:21:44.934 --> 01:21:45.966
and...

01:21:48.638 --> 01:21:51.372
I also have to say
that, uh...

01:21:51.407 --> 01:21:52.447
I think there's
a fourth C.

01:21:52.475 --> 01:21:54.108
There is?

01:21:54.143 --> 01:21:55.075
Yeah.

01:21:55.111 --> 01:21:56.377
C, for change.

01:21:58.948 --> 01:22:00.148
You've changed my life, Lydia.

01:22:02.218 --> 01:22:03.684
You have absolutely
changed mine.

01:22:13.329 --> 01:22:16.597
You know, 12 days is not nearly
enough time to spend with you.

01:22:18.134 --> 01:22:18.966
I have a feeling

01:22:19.001 --> 01:22:20.501
we'll be starting
a whole calendar.

01:22:21.305 --> 01:22:27.804
