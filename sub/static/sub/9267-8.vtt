WEBVTT

00:00.934 --> 00:02.568
I kinda was messing around
with this T.A.

00:02.602 --> 00:04.937
who...is married,

00:04.971 --> 00:07.006
and his wife is crazy.

00:07.040 --> 00:08.273
And she slapped me.

00:08.308 --> 00:09.675
I can't go back there,

00:09.709 --> 00:11.744
and I don't know what to do.

00:11.778 --> 00:14.246
I've been getting phone calls
from different scouts.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.381
I thought we agreed

00:15.415 --> 00:16.548
that everything
was gonna come through me.

00:16.583 --> 00:18.450
This is my son
we talking about.

00:18.485 --> 00:19.718
We got plans for the future.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.720
I can't let you
get in the way of that.

00:21.755 --> 00:24.256
65 yards in the air...

00:24.290 --> 00:26.425
Oh, my, it's gonna be
another touchdown.

00:26.459 --> 00:28.794
[Cheers and applause]

00:31.464 --> 00:34.299
- Vince. Hey, hey.
- What's up?

00:34.334 --> 00:36.068
- This recording, right?
- Yeah.

00:36.102 --> 00:37.770
The red light's on right there.

00:37.804 --> 00:39.204
- You sure?
- Yeah. Red light's on.

00:39.239 --> 00:40.472
Can't miss this one.

00:40.507 --> 00:42.307
This my boy's first interview!

00:42.342 --> 00:45.377
[Cheering, chatter]

00:45.412 --> 00:47.980
Right here.
Come on, hustle now.

00:48.014 --> 00:51.116
The East Dillon Lions,
led by quarterback Vince Howard,

00:51.151 --> 00:53.152
defeated their crosstown rivals

00:53.186 --> 00:55.621
to remain undefeated
through the season.

00:55.655 --> 00:57.256
- Vince, what is...
- Oh, there he is!

00:57.290 --> 01:00.225
[Cheering, chatter]

01:00.260 --> 01:01.427
We're playing for keeps.

01:01.461 --> 01:02.628
The Lions... we're the new
kids on the block.

01:02.662 --> 01:03.929
Panthers, they old news, baby.

01:03.963 --> 01:05.664
You've really stepped up
your game this year.

01:05.698 --> 01:06.999
Thanks. I did take
the summer off.

01:07.033 --> 01:09.468
I worked hard, I'm faster,
stronger, more accurate.

01:09.502 --> 01:10.803
I'm hittin'
my receivers in stride.

01:10.837 --> 01:12.838
I feel like this cannon
is doin' its job.

01:12.872 --> 01:15.240
This offense now focuses
more on you.

01:15.275 --> 01:18.277
Last year we did a lot...
We ran a lot of wildcat.

01:18.311 --> 01:20.079
This season, I'm stepping up
as quarterback,

01:20.113 --> 01:21.513
as captain of this team
and, yeah,

01:21.548 --> 01:23.649
I'm showing the people
what I can do, baby.

01:23.683 --> 01:29.121
[Cheering]

01:29.155 --> 01:32.057
Come here!
I can't believe this!

01:35.395 --> 01:38.030
He's a leader!
Right?

01:38.064 --> 01:39.364
Natural-born leader.

01:39.399 --> 01:41.633
You saw how he looked
at the camera.

01:41.668 --> 01:44.169
You see that?
I know!

01:44.204 --> 01:47.139
[Overlapping chatter]

01:47.173 --> 01:48.974
You didn't like it?

01:49.008 --> 01:50.776
Naw, it was cool but,
you know...

01:50.810 --> 01:53.011
You barely talked about
anybody but yourself.

01:53.046 --> 01:55.013
You got a whole team there.

01:55.048 --> 01:57.049
Oh, no, I did, I did.

01:57.083 --> 01:58.784
They cut before
I even got to it, you know?

01:58.818 --> 02:00.119
I said it like three
or four times.

02:00.153 --> 02:01.386
Vince, that wasn't cut at all.

02:01.421 --> 02:04.523
- They were on you the whole time.
- It was, it was edited.

02:04.557 --> 02:06.158
Hey, hey, hey, don't
worry about that, man.

02:06.192 --> 02:07.860
You the star.
You can't help it.

02:07.894 --> 02:09.328
Huh? Huh?

02:09.362 --> 02:11.697
You did good.
You did good!

02:11.731 --> 02:15.234
He's the star!

02:28.148 --> 02:30.315
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

02:30.350 --> 02:32.351
What if they come home?

02:32.385 --> 02:33.919
They're not coming home.

02:33.953 --> 02:35.420
They're gone all day.

02:35.455 --> 02:39.124
They're gonna go buy a tractor.
It's an all-day affair.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.293
I promise.

02:54.507 --> 02:56.508
Sorry.

02:56.543 --> 02:58.510
What?

02:58.545 --> 03:01.513
Oh, I can't do this.

03:31.177 --> 03:32.711
Finally, tighten
the number four.

03:32.745 --> 03:34.346
Well, it's not the one
you gave me,

03:34.380 --> 03:36.215
'cause this is stripped now.
[Doorbell rings]

03:36.249 --> 03:37.883
- Can you get that, Jules?
- When you get up,

03:37.917 --> 03:39.718
can you see if my glasses
are in the basket, please?

03:39.752 --> 03:41.853
Honey, it's as simple as this.
Look. It's right here.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.322
- What, you can't...
- That's not the one

03:43.356 --> 03:44.656
- you gave me a second ago!
- Um...

03:44.691 --> 03:47.259
- Are they in here?
- Glasses are not in the basket.

03:47.293 --> 03:49.661
Use a spanner
to finely tighten the nuts.

03:49.696 --> 03:51.763
- I got the damn spanner.
- Where is the spanner?

03:51.798 --> 03:54.600
Honey, you need to go
find your glasses.

03:54.634 --> 03:56.435
- You need to be able to see this.
- Hey.

03:56.469 --> 03:58.670
What are you doing here?

03:58.705 --> 04:00.505
I'm sorry.
I didn't know what else to do.

04:00.540 --> 04:02.574
- You haven't returned my calls.
- You need to go.

04:02.609 --> 04:04.009
- You really need to go.
- Can you please come out

04:04.043 --> 04:05.944
- and talk to me for five minutes?
- No, my parents are here.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.379
- So you need to go.
- Hey, who is it?

04:07.413 --> 04:08.914
- Is that your dad?
- Yes, that's my dad,

04:08.948 --> 04:10.782
and my mom's here right now,
so can you please go?

04:10.817 --> 04:12.417
- Hi. Can I help you?
- Yeah. Hi, Mr. Tay...

04:12.452 --> 04:13.752
Coach Taylor, I'm Derek Bishop.

04:13.786 --> 04:15.887
I taught your daughter
at Burleson.

04:15.922 --> 04:18.257
If I could just talk to her
for five minutes...

04:18.291 --> 04:19.858
- Get out of here right now.
- Dad...

04:19.892 --> 04:21.459
Hey, Eric.

04:21.494 --> 04:22.761
I'm not trying to cause
any trouble.

04:22.795 --> 04:25.197
- Get in your car right now.
- Okay, okay. Sorry.

04:25.231 --> 04:26.198
- Dad, stop!
- Eric.

04:26.232 --> 04:27.833
- Dad...
- Eric!

04:27.867 --> 04:29.067
I'm going.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.271
- Get going right now.
- I'm sorry.

04:32.305 --> 04:34.406
Right now.

04:35.575 --> 04:37.676
- Dad...
- Eric!

05:35.501 --> 05:37.235
Oh, here he is himself,
the golden child...

05:37.270 --> 05:38.503
Vince Howard.

05:38.538 --> 05:40.305
Tell us about the brutal
slaughter of the Panthers.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.408
I threw the ball to myself.
I caught it in the end zone.

05:43.443 --> 05:45.644
[Laughter]
Then I kicked the extra point

05:45.678 --> 05:49.014
with my gold-plated schlong.
[Laughter]

05:49.048 --> 05:51.149
Oh, oh, look, look,

05:51.184 --> 05:54.052
and here is the incredible
juggernaut's

05:54.087 --> 05:55.654
beautiful girlfriend.

05:55.688 --> 05:58.123
Tell us, what is it like dating
the most interesting man alive?

05:58.157 --> 05:59.991
Uh-uh, y'all need
to cut that out.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.327
I mean, is it true that he
discovered a new planet?

06:02.362 --> 06:05.130
- You need to stop it.
- Right after he cured cancer.

06:05.164 --> 06:06.998
- Really?
- Well, this is what we heard.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.400
- Comedians here, huh?
- Oh...

06:08.434 --> 06:09.901
Trying to be funny.

06:09.936 --> 06:12.037
I-I get it, I get it.
It's jokes, it's jokes.

06:12.071 --> 06:14.406
But for the record,
I had nothing to do

06:14.440 --> 06:17.142
with them cutting you
out of that interview.

06:17.176 --> 06:18.744
I mean, they even
cut out that part

06:18.778 --> 06:20.512
when I ran over number 48,
Max Griffin... boom!

06:20.546 --> 06:22.147
A'ight? You know, man.

06:22.181 --> 06:24.483
Just seems like you're gettin'
a lot of air time, that's all.

06:24.517 --> 06:27.486
I mean, with a face like
this, how could you not, right?

06:27.520 --> 06:31.423
Right?
Joey, come on, man.

06:31.457 --> 06:33.725
Joey.

06:39.699 --> 06:42.567
[Overlapping shouting]

06:44.070 --> 06:45.570
Hey!

06:47.073 --> 06:48.106
Hey!

06:50.476 --> 06:53.178
Why are you fighting?

06:53.212 --> 06:54.613
You know,
you've been doing great.

06:54.647 --> 06:57.282
Your grades are getting better.
You've got to stop it.

06:57.316 --> 06:59.050
- She started it.
- I don't care!

06:59.085 --> 07:00.852
That's the thing.
It doesn't matter who starts it.

07:00.887 --> 07:02.053
You gotta stop it.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.055
You start feeling that urge,
you get irked,

07:04.090 --> 07:07.025
you gotta walk away.

07:07.059 --> 07:10.562
I'm on your side here.

07:10.596 --> 07:13.231
But you gotta help me.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.937
Are you gonna finish that?

07:32.518 --> 07:34.085
Haah!

07:34.120 --> 07:35.420
Team: Haah!

07:35.455 --> 07:37.589
All: <i>A ka mate, ka mate,</i>
<i>ora!</i>

07:37.623 --> 07:40.292
<i>A ka mate, ka mate, ora!</i>

07:40.326 --> 07:45.063
[Continuing in Samoan]

07:45.097 --> 07:48.300
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

07:48.334 --> 07:50.202
Coach Riggins.
[Guys yelling]

07:50.236 --> 07:52.971
Coach Riggins!

07:53.005 --> 07:54.272
Coach Riggins.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.841
Hey.

07:55.875 --> 07:58.210
Look, we only slotted
30 minutes for defense.

07:58.244 --> 07:59.644
Yeah, hold on, did you see?

07:59.679 --> 08:01.379
It's like a...
A pregame war dance

08:01.414 --> 08:03.315
to get the other team
psyched out.

08:03.349 --> 08:05.417
I was working on these moves
all last night.

08:05.451 --> 08:08.053
Let me tell you,
defense is discipline.

08:08.087 --> 08:09.588
That's how we win.

08:09.622 --> 08:11.156
Okay? You understand?

08:11.190 --> 08:14.626
Enough with the dance practice.
Let's get back in our group.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.461
Oh. Hey, what happened?

08:16.496 --> 08:18.263
- Hey, hey!
- You okay?

08:18.297 --> 08:19.831
What happened?
What the hell happened?

08:19.866 --> 08:21.166
I don't know I didn't see.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.468
Let's get him up.
Let's get him up.

08:23.503 --> 08:27.138
You're gonna be
all right, Buddy.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.139
You okay?

08:28.174 --> 08:29.641
- What is it?
- I don't know.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.409
It's his left leg.
I don't know.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.945
Let's go.
Let's go, everybody up!

08:33.980 --> 08:35.514
Yeah. Hairline fracture.

08:35.548 --> 08:37.616
Why can't they give us
something solid?

08:37.650 --> 08:39.183
It's either broken or it's not.

08:39.217 --> 08:41.318
And obviously, it's broken.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.188
What on God's green earth
is a Samoan war dance?

08:44.222 --> 08:46.324
Do they even play football
in Samoa?

08:46.359 --> 08:49.628
- What was Billy Riggins...
- Dad, I don't feel good.

08:59.772 --> 09:01.339
We're sitting here
in the middle

09:01.374 --> 09:02.641
of an undefeated season,

09:02.675 --> 09:04.476
and you weren't even
playing football.

09:04.510 --> 09:06.545
I know, dad.

09:06.579 --> 09:09.047
I know.

09:17.523 --> 09:19.891
All right.

09:19.926 --> 09:22.227
Let's just sit here.

09:38.177 --> 09:39.311
[Knocking on door]
Mm-hmm.

09:39.345 --> 09:40.412
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:40.446 --> 09:42.180
Someone's here to see you.

09:42.214 --> 09:43.982
Oh, thank you. Great.
Okay.

09:50.890 --> 09:52.257
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:52.291 --> 09:54.125
I don't think
that I'm gonna be...

09:54.160 --> 09:55.694
Before you say anything,

09:55.728 --> 09:57.929
I need to tell you
how sorry I am

09:57.964 --> 09:59.731
- this has happened.
- I appreciate that.

09:59.765 --> 10:02.567
I don't really want to be
talking to you right now, Derek.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.603
- Appreciate you coming by.
- Mrs. Taylor, please.

10:04.637 --> 10:07.405
- I've resigned.
- Good.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.541
I think I can get Julie
to go back to school.

10:09.575 --> 10:11.076
How do you plan to do that?

10:11.110 --> 10:13.712
She's a bright young girl.
I know you know that.

10:13.746 --> 10:15.814
- Yes, I do.
- I couldn't live with myself

10:15.848 --> 10:19.284
if...I was the reason
that she dropped out of college.

10:19.318 --> 10:21.086
I'm trying to make this right.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.621
You can't.

10:22.655 --> 10:24.656
I think I can
if I can just talk to her.

10:24.690 --> 10:26.958
Please.

10:26.993 --> 10:29.828
Well, I appreciate your time.

10:31.530 --> 10:34.332
Thank you.

10:40.039 --> 10:42.273
Do you know how I know
that there's a lord above?

10:42.308 --> 10:43.908
Because that sweet,
sweet baby boy

10:43.943 --> 10:46.344
sleeps for the same two hours
every day

10:46.379 --> 10:48.880
for what I like to call
Mama Mindy time.

10:48.914 --> 10:51.049
- To God, honey.
- To God.

10:51.083 --> 10:55.286
- [Whooping]
- He's a sweet boy.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.022
Becky, what are you doing?

10:57.056 --> 11:00.625
I am...I'm trying to decide
if I want to do a pageant.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.461
- Aw...
- Miss America?

11:03.496 --> 11:04.896
- The beauty queen.
- Uh-oh.

11:04.930 --> 11:07.932
Oh, no, I mean, you have to
build up a track record

11:07.967 --> 11:10.568
in regionals
and win some smaller pageants.

11:10.603 --> 11:13.071
Like I won like chambers
of commerce and stuff like that.
