16:31.214 --> 16:32.182
Oh, I was just, like, next in

16:32.184 --> 16:33.214
- line. Sorry about...
- Oh, God.

16:33.216 --> 16:35.515
- I didn't...
- I cannot wait to see you play live.

16:35.551 --> 16:37.184
I've built it up in my head so much.

16:37.219 --> 16:39.219
Mm-hmm. Yeah, the
pressure's pretty high, huh?

16:39.254 --> 16:41.421
Yes, of course. You know what,
let me get out of your hair.

16:41.423 --> 16:42.790
- I can't wait.
- Cool.

16:42.825 --> 16:44.157
Oh, shit.

16:45.895 --> 16:48.829
Okay, everybody, three minutes
until we walk, three minutes!

16:48.864 --> 16:50.263
- Hey, Ty.
- Hey, Mike.

16:50.299 --> 16:51.419
Yeah, Phil's brother, right?

16:51.433 --> 16:53.800
Um, well, actually, it's...
Phil would be my brother

16:53.835 --> 16:55.168
because I'm the older one, so...

16:55.170 --> 16:56.836
Where is Phil? That guy rules, man.

16:56.871 --> 16:59.272
Hey, um, Ty, can I ask you something?

16:59.308 --> 17:00.240
Uh, yeah, sure.

17:00.275 --> 17:02.175
- It's a little bit personal.
- Shoot, man.

17:02.211 --> 17:04.611
I'm trying to write a song for a girl.

17:04.646 --> 17:07.880
Do you have, like, any tips
that could maybe, help me out?

17:07.915 --> 17:10.049
I just can't write a
song for the life of me.

17:10.085 --> 17:13.118
Well, you just gotta
write from your heart, man.

17:13.154 --> 17:14.887
That's what all great songwriters do.

17:14.923 --> 17:16.122
Write from your heart.

17:16.156 --> 17:17.957
So you're saying, if I just be myself

17:17.992 --> 17:20.760
and trust my own instincts,
inspiration will strike.

17:20.795 --> 17:24.695
And no amount of practice
or years of doing it

17:24.732 --> 17:26.298
will really make a difference.

17:26.334 --> 17:27.532
- Exactly.
- Yes.

17:27.568 --> 17:29.968
- Believe in yourself, Mikey.
- Thanks, Ty.

17:30.004 --> 17:31.970
Okay, the procession has started. Music!

17:32.006 --> 17:34.573
Okay, uh, everybody, it's
go time. Ready? Here we go.

17:34.609 --> 17:36.408
All right. Cronin, focus up!

17:36.444 --> 17:38.244
One, two, three, four!

17:38.279 --> 17:41.379
("Here Comes the Bride" playing)

17:43.450 --> 17:45.851
- Wow.
- Pat, she looks beautiful.

17:45.886 --> 17:46.952
She's a stunner.

17:46.987 --> 17:49.154
And I'm allowed to say
that 'cause I'm a priest.

17:49.189 --> 17:51.289
'Cause I'm kinda out of the game, so...

17:51.324 --> 17:54.059
As hot as your wife
is, God is a lot hotter.

17:54.094 --> 17:55.761
Heh. We'll put it that way.

17:55.796 --> 17:57.395
Ooh, is it nervous in here?

17:57.430 --> 18:00.298
Hey, honey. Look at all these
people just staring at us.

18:00.333 --> 18:01.799
- It's fucking weird, right?
- It's so crazy.

18:01.801 --> 18:04.202
- I'm super excited.
- Um, where's Phil?

18:04.237 --> 18:05.436
Yeah, oh, um, sorry.

18:05.472 --> 18:07.639
There was kind of a... Well,
there was, like, an incident.

18:07.641 --> 18:09.106
- What?
- Look, I don't know.

18:09.142 --> 18:10.675
I mean, the guy took off,
I can't find him.

18:10.677 --> 18:13.678
- What, what do you mean?
- I'm like, "hello, hello," he doesn't respond.

18:13.713 --> 18:15.273
- What?
- And now, ladies and gentlemen,

18:15.281 --> 18:17.114
if you'd please turn your
attention to the back,

18:17.116 --> 18:22.252
it is time for Mason, the ring boy!

18:22.288 --> 18:23.587
All right, y'all.

18:23.622 --> 18:27.224
Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four, three, two...

18:27.259 --> 18:32.028
One! It's the moment that's bigger
than the actual nuptials themself,

18:32.064 --> 18:34.364
- it's Mason!

Natalie, you're behind.

18:55.152 --> 18:56.819
You gotta make the snaps snap.

You're making the snap crap.

you're just gonna fuck up?

Mommy's getting married to the guy.

Oh, boy, I gotta go.

19:28.785 --> 19:29.984
Whoop, okay.

19:30.019 --> 19:31.419
A little bit of "Hey, how are you?"

19:31.454 --> 19:32.887
And now we're back.

19:32.922 --> 19:34.922
Mommy! Mom, I'm here...

19:34.958 --> 19:36.858
Okay, everyone, quiet down, I'm here.

Mommy!

19:41.631 --> 19:42.696
Mommy?

19:42.732 --> 19:47.200
Look how much cuter and
younger Mason is than Phil.

19:47.236 --> 19:50.036
I bet he's gonna get so many presents.

19:50.072 --> 19:51.938
I legit hate Phil now.

19:51.974 --> 19:56.009
I love Mason more than
either of my real sons.

19:56.044 --> 19:57.745
He's the best.

19:57.780 --> 20:02.048
I agree, honey. Let's go mush
our butts on Philip's bed.

20:02.084 --> 20:03.049
Okay.

20:03.085 --> 20:05.085
Phil is going to hell,

20:05.120 --> 20:06.619
to Jewish hell!

20:06.655 --> 20:10.523

20:10.558 --> 20:12.926
I'm gay!

20:12.961 --> 20:14.627
I'm albino.

20:14.663 --> 20:17.096

20:17.131 --> 20:20.032

Oh, there he is.

20:38.686 --> 20:40.085
Oh, fuck.

20:40.121 --> 20:44.356
And when he says, "I wish you would
step back from that ledge, my friend,"

20:44.391 --> 20:46.325
he's actually talking about suicide.

20:46.360 --> 20:48.794
Yeah, that's cool, dude.

20:48.829 --> 20:50.094
- Oh, shit.
- What?

Oh, my God!

21:15.922 --> 21:16.921
Eww!

21:16.957 --> 21:18.323
Aww.

21:21.261 --> 21:23.561
- Ugh.
- Oh, my God.

21:23.596 --> 21:24.695
What is this crap?

21:24.731 --> 21:27.231
- It's chunky.
- Looks like shit, ugh!

21:27.266 --> 21:29.533
No! Why?!

21:29.569 --> 21:31.301
Why did you do this to me?

21:31.337 --> 21:34.405
Because! 'Cause Mason's replacing me,

21:34.440 --> 21:36.607
and I fucking hate Pat, Mom.

21:36.642 --> 21:40.077
And if you marry him, well, that means
that our real dad's never coming back.

21:40.112 --> 21:42.645
And that's... That's not fair.

21:42.681 --> 21:45.916
'Cause... 'Cause why did he leave us?

21:45.951 --> 21:49.186
Why did Daddy leave us? Am I that bad?

21:49.221 --> 21:52.389
Are we... Are we that bad?

21:52.424 --> 21:56.526
Phil, you're not bad.

21:56.561 --> 22:00.296
Your dad and I weren't
right for each other.

22:00.331 --> 22:02.632
He's gone. And he's not coming back.

22:02.674 --> 22:05.275
I love Pat, and he loves me.

22:05.303 --> 22:08.471
And although you may not
be able to tell right now,

22:08.507 --> 22:11.640
he loves you and Mike so much.

22:11.675 --> 22:14.243
Is that true, Pat... you big bitch?

22:14.279 --> 22:15.844
- Sorry, Mommy.
- It's true.

22:15.880 --> 22:18.480
I know things feel real weird right now,

22:18.516 --> 22:21.250
but soon we're gonna
have a bigger family,

22:21.286 --> 22:22.919
and it's gonna be
filled with so much love.

22:22.921 --> 22:24.921
More love than you could ever imagine.

22:24.956 --> 22:27.156
- Really?
- Yeah. I promise.

22:27.191 --> 22:28.957
I'm sorry, Mommy.

22:28.992 --> 22:29.991
I'm sorry.

22:30.027 --> 22:31.894
- I kinda ruined your wedding a little bit.
- You did.

22:31.896 --> 22:34.162
You did, but I love you still so much.

22:34.197 --> 22:36.197
I think it will make a good story.

22:36.233 --> 22:37.332
Come here.

22:37.367 --> 22:39.601
- And I love you, too, Pat.
- Mm-hmm.

22:39.637 --> 22:43.138
Like, you smell good,
like, you're strong,

22:43.173 --> 22:45.606
it feels good when you talk to me,

22:45.642 --> 22:48.043
and, like, I need that sort
of influence in my life.

22:48.078 --> 22:50.745
Mason, get in here, you little scamp.

22:50.780 --> 22:54.349
You mean it? Aww. That feels good.

22:54.384 --> 22:55.783
Eww. You kissed my chest.

22:55.819 --> 22:58.653

cool, but he's cool.

Oh, no. It still feels
like incest. I'm so sorry.

25:16.088 --> 25:18.121
Okay, everybody, let's
get in for a picture.

25:18.156 --> 25:20.223
Come on, tall people in the back,

25:20.258 --> 25:21.725
short people in the front.

25:21.727 --> 25:23.526
- Here we go.
- All right, squeeze in.

25:23.562 --> 25:25.996
Joshua, get closer. I need
to feel you next to me.

25:26.031 --> 25:27.030
I love you so much.

25:27.066 --> 25:28.599
Well, what do you say, Mikey?

25:28.634 --> 25:30.400
Another adventure on the books, huh?

25:30.435 --> 25:33.669
I'm just glad we got through
it together, you know?

25:33.705 --> 25:34.937
I love you, bro.

25:34.973 --> 25:36.806
- Hey, Phil?
- What?

25:36.841 --> 25:39.609
(chuckles) Honestly, it
feels good every time.

25:39.644 --> 25:43.003
And also, why are you dressed
up like Ellen DeGeneres?

25:43.006 --> 25:44.080
All right, here we go.

25:44.082 --> 25:45.681
Mason: Say cheese. Okay, I will.

25:45.717 --> 25:47.182
Everybody say cheese.

25:47.184 --> 25:48.250
All: Cheese!

25:48.285 --> 25:50.820
(cheering)

25:50.855 --> 25:54.189
All right, I want to see that
pit fucking open up out there!

25:54.225 --> 25:55.324
It's time to get wild!

25:55.359 --> 25:56.792
Mason, you're my little brother now,

25:56.794 --> 25:58.524
so I get to tell you
what's cool in music.

25:58.527 --> 26:00.962
Ty Segall's the fucking
truth! He's fucking wild!

26:00.965 --> 26:04.233
Grandma, I wanna see you
fucking headwalk, let's go!
