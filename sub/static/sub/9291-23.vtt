00:16.600 --> 00:19.160
I've been told a cruise missile was launched
containing a nuclear warhead.

00:19.240 --> 00:20.360
That's correct.

00:20.440 --> 00:22.440
What about Marwan? You think he'll break?

00:22.520 --> 00:27.160
That won't be easy, sir. He's planned and
organised everything that's happened today.

00:27.560 --> 00:31.000
How do I fight terrorists
while provoking a nuclear superpower?

00:31.080 --> 00:32.880
We marched on Chinese soil,

00:32.960 --> 00:37.120
we kidnapped one of their nationals, and
in the process the Chinese consul was killed.

00:37.200 --> 00:42.280
The murder of our consul on Chinese soil
could be construed as an act of war.

00:42.360 --> 00:46.360
I assume you know this man.
Howard Bern, one of your field agents.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.880
Camera at the consulate picked up your face.

00:48.960 --> 00:52.480
- I was wearing my mask.
- Trust me, I saw the freeze-frame. It was you.

00:52.560 --> 00:53.600
I'm sorry, Jack.

00:53.680 --> 00:55.840
You gotta go.
There's a chopper waiting for you.

00:55.920 --> 00:59.640
It doesn't matter where you take me.
What I want is already happening.

01:02.280 --> 01:03.800
Go!

01:04.800 --> 01:07.880
Notify the perimeter
we no longer have Marwan in custody.

01:08.760 --> 01:12.680
Richard Heller called Marwan a week ago.
They're bringing him to CTU.

01:13.120 --> 01:15.400
This is a sketch of the guy
Richard Heller described.

01:15.480 --> 01:18.000
He and the girl are our only leads
to finding Marwan.

01:18.080 --> 01:19.800
One of us is gonna get caught
to save the other?

01:19.880 --> 01:22.120
It's gonna be you.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.440
Tony, wait.

01:24.520 --> 01:26.600
I can't spend another day without you.

01:26.680 --> 01:29.480
I'm ready to leave here.
I'm ready to go with you.

01:31.240 --> 01:32.240
Be careful.

01:33.080 --> 01:34.200
Tony, this is Jack.

01:34.280 --> 01:37.080
- "Has anybody reported outside movement?"
- No. Why?

01:37.160 --> 01:39.640
The man is dead.
The girl is no longer in the apartment.

01:40.240 --> 01:41.840
Tony, do you copy?

01:42.080 --> 01:43.520
Tony, do you copy?

01:43.600 --> 01:45.600
Castle, why is Almeida not on com?

01:46.720 --> 01:52.920
All teams, this is Bauer. Castle is down.
Almeida is missing and possibly a hostage.

01:59.640 --> 02:03.280
- " Have you apprehended her?"
- No, we do not have her in custody.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.560
She's hiding here in the apartment complex.

02:05.640 --> 02:08.919
She killed Castle and I believe
she's taken Almeida as a hostage.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.640
- Is there any way she slipped the perimeter?
- No.

02:11.720 --> 02:15.000
There's over 600 apartments.
We have to search them room by room.

02:15.080 --> 02:18.680
- Listen, we need more personnel here.
- We're running low on manpower.

02:18.760 --> 02:21.520
There's a missile in the air
carrying a nuclear warhead.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.200
This is our best shot at taking it out
before it hits.

02:24.280 --> 02:27.880
The White House is searching for the missile.
We're stretched thin.

02:27.960 --> 02:32.560
We'll have LAPD send more men. We'll send
Curtis and another tac team to the location.

02:32.640 --> 02:36.680
OK. We've initiated a search starting with
the buildings nearest the perimeter,

02:36.760 --> 02:39.400
working our way in,
but we need LAPD here now.

02:39.480 --> 02:41.640
Keep us posted. Contact Division.

02:41.720 --> 02:45.080
See if they can spare more men.
I'll call our liaison at LAPD.

02:45.720 --> 02:49.560
We've almost completed our satellite pass
over the radius of the missile.

02:49.640 --> 02:52.280
- And no sign of it yet?
- No, not so far.

02:52.920 --> 02:57.200
What do you think our chances are of locating
the missile with subsequent passes?

02:57.280 --> 02:59.960
They're not very good.
This missile's an S-class.

03:00.040 --> 03:03.840
It uses elements of Stealth technology.
It was designed to evade detection.

03:03.920 --> 03:06.240
I know, but it will still have a heat signature.

03:06.320 --> 03:10.400
Yes, but the lower the missile flies
to the ground, the harder it is to pick up.

03:10.480 --> 03:13.200
How much longer
until you've completed the pass?

03:13.280 --> 03:15.000
Uh, less than 20 minutes.

03:15.080 --> 03:18.360
- Get back to me when you have the results.
- All right.

03:18.440 --> 03:21.840
- We need every agent there.
- " They're not cleared for field work."

03:21.920 --> 03:26.880
Bump up their security level on a provisional
basis. Call me back with the exact number.

03:26.960 --> 03:30.760
All right. Coordinate that with Edgar Stiles
here at com. Thanks, Rick.

03:30.840 --> 03:33.880
- What did LAPD say?
- They're keeping units in reserve...

03:33.960 --> 03:38.640
- They're sending more patrolmen to Jack?
- They're sending nine over there now and...

03:38.720 --> 03:41.080
Nine? That's not nearly enough.

03:41.160 --> 03:44.280
- We'll have to reassign our people there.
- I'm taking care of that.

03:44.360 --> 03:47.480
When? We need people there now.
This woman has to be captured.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.320
Michelle.

03:49.400 --> 03:52.880
Everyone understands what's at stake here.

03:52.960 --> 03:56.680
We're gonna do our best to find this woman,
but we have to remain calm,

03:56.760 --> 04:00.080
or everything will spiral out of control.

04:02.760 --> 04:05.000
You're right. I'm not being objective.

04:05.080 --> 04:08.480
I'll admit it. I'm worried about
what this woman might do to Tony,

04:08.560 --> 04:11.000
but I will not lose sight of the big picture.

04:11.080 --> 04:15.680
The big picture is that
we have to apprehend this hostile alive.

04:16.160 --> 04:18.200
Nothing else matters.

04:42.440 --> 04:46.160
- What is it, Marwan?
- You're late. You were supposed to check in.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.720
I know. There was a hitch.

04:48.800 --> 04:52.760
- "Nothing serious. Um, I am gonna be there."
- What kind of hitch?

04:52.840 --> 04:56.640
There was a problem in the apartment
and I'm dealing with it.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.400
I'm leaving in one hour.
I'm not waiting for you.

04:59.480 --> 05:01.800
I know, and I'm gonna be there.

05:23.160 --> 05:25.520
Well, we don't have much time.

05:25.600 --> 05:30.960
They're very close to finding us and that
would be very, very bad for both of us.

05:31.040 --> 05:36.480
So tell me. Two years ago you put Michelle
Dessler's life ahead of national security.

05:36.560 --> 05:39.760
You let a suspect escape
and you committed treason.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.240
Is she gonna do the same for you?

05:46.120 --> 05:49.160
- "Mike, it's Audrey Raines."
- Yes, Audrey. What have you got?

05:49.240 --> 05:54.040
The satellite pass is complete. We could not
detect the missile with thermal imaging.

05:54.120 --> 05:57.480
There's just too much radiant heat
from ground sources.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.760
Ms Raines, this is President Palmer.

05:59.840 --> 06:03.280
Is there a chance another satellite pass
will find the missile?

06:03.360 --> 06:06.160
Well, the more data we have,
Mr President, the better,

06:06.240 --> 06:09.720
but a more intensive pass
will take two to three hours.

06:09.800 --> 06:13.160
And we expect the missile
to find its target before then.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.000
Yes, sir, we do.

06:16.160 --> 06:21.120
All right. Make sure FBI's on a real-time link
with all local emergency channels.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.240
I'll get that done right now.

06:23.320 --> 06:27.160
I also want you to compile disaster scenarios
for the urban centres

06:27.240 --> 06:29.520
within range of the missile.

06:31.880 --> 06:34.800
Sir, that's 20 of the largest cities
in this country.

06:34.880 --> 06:36.680
I'm aware of that. I want death rates,

06:36.760 --> 06:40.360
fallout patterns, emergency response
predictions for all of them.

06:40.440 --> 06:44.560
- Yes, sir. I'll take care of that right now.
- Thank you, Ms Raines.

06:44.640 --> 06:49.320
Assign teams sections of the grid. We do not
want people bumping into each other.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.720
If the subject is spotted, what's the protocol?

06:51.800 --> 06:55.000
We maximise for capture.
There can be no lag time.

06:55.080 --> 06:57.920
You wanna evaluate the formation?
She's got Tony hostage.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.040
We proceed as if there is no hostage.

07:00.120 --> 07:03.360
There is only one operational objective -
to capture this woman.

07:03.440 --> 07:07.200
Make sure that's the profile you send out
to all the teams. Understand?

07:07.280 --> 07:09.360
Yes.

07:14.840 --> 07:16.280
Dessler.

07:16.360 --> 07:19.880
Why don't you go somewhere private
so we can talk?

07:19.960 --> 07:23.280
- Who is this?
- I'm sending you the answer.

07:37.840 --> 07:38.800
Tony.

07:38.880 --> 07:41.160
Now do you know who this is?

07:42.280 --> 07:45.360
And don't bother trying to triangulate the call.

07:45.440 --> 07:49.680
- It's scrambled.
- Please, don't hurt him.

07:49.760 --> 07:55.080
He's OK for now, but he won't be
unless you do everything that I say, Michelle.

07:55.160 --> 07:59.240
- I understand.
- I need your help getting outta here.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.080
- Wh-what kind of help?
- You're hesitating.

08:03.160 --> 08:06.960
I'm not. I'm not.
I just need to know what you want me to do.

08:07.040 --> 08:09.080
Your men are between me and my exit.

08:09.160 --> 08:13.040
I need to know what their search patterns are
and how many men there are.

08:13.120 --> 08:16.280
- OK. OK. I'll find out.
- You'll tell me right now.

08:16.360 --> 08:20.080
- I have to talk to my tactical teams.
- Oh, Michelle, you're stalling.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.600
How many men are there, total?

08:22.680 --> 08:27.320
Upwards of 30, not including LAPD,
and reinforcements are on the way.

08:27.400 --> 08:33.000
You will need to remove your men
from the northeast driveway of the complex.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.120
I-I don't know if I can do that.

08:35.200 --> 08:38.240
You will redeploy your men
by the time I call you back,

08:38.320 --> 08:40.880
or Tony dies.

08:41.320 --> 08:45.960
- When are you calling back?
- "Soon. Get moving, Michelle."

08:49.000 --> 08:50.960
Oh, she still loves you.

08:51.040 --> 08:53.320
The question is how much.

09:14.120 --> 09:17.120
- "Edgar Stiles."
- Send the deployment group to my screen.

09:17.200 --> 09:21.480
- It's updating. You want the last version?
- "Just send it."

09:29.000 --> 09:31.560
- Are reinforcements there?
- "Some are on site now."

09:31.640 --> 09:37.680
Some will be there in 15 minutes. You want
me to send the upgraded grid when it's in?

09:38.440 --> 09:40.000
Ms Dessler?

09:40.080 --> 09:41.000
Yes.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.360
Yes, do that.

10:00.200 --> 10:04.800
No. No, we can't eliminate the Midwest or
any region within the missile's flying range.

10:04.880 --> 10:07.120
All areas of the country are vulnerable?

10:07.200 --> 10:10.800
Yes, that's what I'm trying to tell you.
This warhead could hit anywhere.

10:10.880 --> 10:14.840
We're putting together the projected
casualty numbers. They're gonna be high.

10:14.920 --> 10:16.840
Yeah.

10:17.720 --> 10:20.640
- Where are we on the apartments search?
- Nothing so far.

10:20.720 --> 10:23.400
- LAPD there yet?
- They're on their way.

10:23.880 --> 10:26.640
I'll be at com.

10:26.720 --> 10:28.960
I can't do this.

10:30.160 --> 10:32.200
Can't do what?

10:33.000 --> 10:38.240
I can't sacrifice the lives of all those people
if this warhead goes off.

10:40.080 --> 10:43.320
- She called me.
- Who? Who called you?

10:43.400 --> 10:45.840
The hostile who has Tony.

10:46.600 --> 10:50.280
- When? What did she say?
- A couple of minutes ago.

10:50.360 --> 10:54.160
She said to redeploy our men
so she can get away...

10:55.400 --> 10:57.840
or Tony dies.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.920
- " Yes, sir?"
- Patch me through to Jack Bauer.

11:12.640 --> 11:17.200
Take your team.
Start working the second floor, building 11.

11:17.280 --> 11:19.240
- " Jack, you read me?"
- I copy.

11:19.320 --> 11:22.040
We've got something.
The suspect contacted Michelle.

11:22.120 --> 11:24.680
She confirms she's holding Tony hostage.

11:24.760 --> 11:28.560
She's trying to use him as leverage against
Michelle to open an escape route.

11:28.640 --> 11:31.120
- Is Michelle there?
- I'm right here, Jack.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.320
Do we have any idea where she is?

11:33.400 --> 11:37.520
She wants me to clear the northeast driveway.
She's going to call to confirm I did it.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.800
- When?
- I don't know. It could be any second.

11:39.880 --> 11:43.480
I want you to make her believe
that you're still cooperating with her.

11:43.560 --> 11:45.600
I need you to draw her into the open.

11:45.680 --> 11:49.280
I promise you that we will do
everything we can for Tony.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.280
OK.

11:50.360 --> 11:52.240
Stay ready for her call.

11:52.320 --> 11:56.680
I'll pull all our units out of the northeast
driveway, put them in concealed positions.

11:56.760 --> 12:00.280
She might change her mind at the last minute
and try another escape route.

12:00.360 --> 12:04.160
We'll be ready for that, but I want her
to believe Michelle's complying.

12:04.240 --> 12:08.800
Once she's 50 yards outside of the complex
and can't re-enter, our teams will converge.

12:08.880 --> 12:12.880
- Let me know when your men can redeploy.
- Copy that.

12:16.800 --> 12:19.600
- Are you gonna be all right?
- Yeah.

12:23.200 --> 12:26.920
- I was gonna do what she wanted.
- Michelle.

12:27.000 --> 12:32.960
I didn't call you right away. All I could
think of at first was saving Tony's life.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.560
It's OK. It's done.

12:49.760 --> 12:52.520
" Los Angeles Police Department.
Open up!

12:52.600 --> 12:54.680
Yes, sir.

12:54.760 --> 12:59.240
All designated teams, prepare to move into
secondary positions on my command. Curtis.

12:59.320 --> 13:02.160
- What should I do?
- Some residents aren't cooperating.

13:02.240 --> 13:05.320
Have LAPD units arrest anybody
that's giving us a problem.

13:05.400 --> 13:08.120
Why don't we pull some of the resources
off the search?

13:08.200 --> 13:10.760
We'd have a better chance
of finding the hostile.

13:10.840 --> 13:14.000
The hostile will look for any sign
that Michelle's betrayed her.

13:14.080 --> 13:17.200
We have to act as if we have
no idea they've been in contact.

13:17.280 --> 13:20.120
- Understood.
- Once you're done with LAPD, I need you.

13:20.200 --> 13:21.560
You got it.

13:21.640 --> 13:23.800
- Bill, this is Jack. Do you copy?
- Yeah.

13:23.880 --> 13:27.080
We're ready to go here.
Any new communication from the hostile?

13:27.160 --> 13:31.480
No, Michelle's still waiting for her call.
Have you been able to make any ID on scene?

13:31.560 --> 13:34.520
Forensics tried to pull prints,
but came up with nothing.

13:34.600 --> 13:37.360
Same result here.
No match on the voiceprint.

13:37.440 --> 13:39.920
She's managed to stay completely
out of the radar.

13:40.000 --> 13:44.480
We're gonna have to hope she slips up and
makes a mistake, otherwise we're in trouble.

13:44.560 --> 13:47.600
- Proceed when ready. We're standing by.
- "Copy that."

13:47.680 --> 13:51.400
All northeast driveway teams,
move into secondary positions. We're a go.

15:30.440 --> 15:32.360
- Hi. What are you doing here?
- Hey.

15:32.440 --> 15:36.240
You're supposed to stay in your apartment.
There's some crazy person loose.

15:36.320 --> 15:40.640
- Yeah, I know. I know. Hey, where's Joss?
- He just got up.

15:40.720 --> 15:43.840
Can you just get him?
I need to talk to him. Something happened.

15:43.920 --> 15:44.960
Joss!

15:45.040 --> 15:47.840
- What's going on?
- Nothing, just weird stuff.

15:47.920 --> 15:49.200
- What?
- Nothing.

15:49.280 --> 15:52.920
- Why don't you just tell me?
- No, it's cool.

15:53.000 --> 15:56.280
- Hey, what's going on?
- Hey, man, how are you?

16:08.240 --> 16:10.680
Not a sound.

16:27.240 --> 16:31.400
I just got off a very disturbing phone call
from the Chinese foreign secretary.

16:31.480 --> 16:33.720
They're pressing us on the consulate attack?

16:33.800 --> 16:36.200
It's much worse than that, David.

16:36.280 --> 16:39.520
The fallout from that attack
you authorised is escalating.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.240
They're determined to pin this on us.

16:42.320 --> 16:47.280
If they confirm this is one of our men, I don't
have to tell you how disastrous it would be.

16:47.360 --> 16:49.200
No, sir, you don't.

16:49.280 --> 16:53.960
This is not conclusive enough for the Chinese
to turn this into an international incident.

16:54.040 --> 16:58.000
- If they find corroborating evidence?
- CTU is preventing that from happening,

16:58.080 --> 17:02.800
including getting this agent out of sight
until it blows over.

17:03.560 --> 17:06.040
I gave you the authority to make the decision,

17:06.119 --> 17:09.400
but you never should have
ordered that assault.

17:09.480 --> 17:13.079
If we hadn't carried out the raid,
we'd be nowhere in stopping the missile.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.200
And where are we, David?

17:15.280 --> 17:17.960
Is there some progress I don't know about?

17:18.040 --> 17:21.359
CTU is closing in
on one of Marwan's associates.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.839
If they apprehend her in time, they feel
they can use her to find Marwan.

17:24.920 --> 17:28.960
Do you know how speculative that sounds?
My God, we're never gonna find it in time!

17:29.040 --> 17:30.880
Don't say that!

17:34.160 --> 17:37.200
We will. You must believe that
if you're going to lead today.

17:37.280 --> 17:40.480
How? Every second brings that missile
closer to its target,

17:40.560 --> 17:43.280
which, for all we know, is us.

17:43.360 --> 17:46.040
We are not sitting on our hands, Mr President.

17:46.120 --> 17:49.680
We are using every resource at our disposal
to find this missile.

17:49.760 --> 17:52.480
We will prevent the warhead from going off.

17:54.600 --> 17:57.400
I wish I was as confident as you are.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.000
You need to be.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.480
Remain presidential.

18:03.560 --> 18:09.160
Demand nothing less than success
from your people and you will get it.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.160
All right.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.320
All right.

18:17.680 --> 18:21.480
- What do I tell the Chinese foreign secretary?
- You don't.

18:21.560 --> 18:26.200
Let Mike handle this. He'll tell them
unless they have proof of our involvement,

18:26.280 --> 18:29.240
you don't wanna hear from them today.

18:35.600 --> 18:38.920
- " Mr Buchanan, Agent Bern on six."
- Send it to my cellphone.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.120
Yes, sir.

18:46.920 --> 18:47.880
Buchanan.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.280
It's Agent Bern, sir. I got a message
to call you as soon as I landed.

18:51.360 --> 18:55.880
- Are we on a secure line?
- Yes, sir, it's an encrypted cell.

18:55.960 --> 19:00.560
The Chinese are pressing the case that we're
involved in the assault on their consulate.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.000
Have they found evidence
beyond the video of me?

19:03.080 --> 19:05.240
No, and we have to make sure they don't.

19:05.320 --> 19:08.680
I want you to start fabricating an alibi
with CTU in San Diego.

19:08.760 --> 19:11.440
Make it look like you worked there
during the assault.

19:11.520 --> 19:15.040
Our transport's arriving right now, sir.
I'll get right on it.

19:15.120 --> 19:17.680
The alibi has to withstand careful scrutiny.

19:17.760 --> 19:21.920
San Diego phone logs, rosters
and mainframe records all have to back it up.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.920
- It'll be ain' tight, sir.
- It has to be.

19:26.160 --> 19:31.200
Sir, about my family, do you think there's any
chance the Chinese will try to get to them?

19:31.280 --> 19:36.080
They can't. We've already contacted your wife
and we've moved her and your kids to a hotel.

19:36.160 --> 19:39.480
- "I'll be in touch, Agent Bern."
- Thank you very much, sir.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.360
Drive.

19:56.560 --> 20:01.000
- What the hell is this?
- I think you already know what this is.

20:01.080 --> 20:04.760
CTU sent a team into our consulate
just a few hours ago.

20:04.840 --> 20:08.920
You were on the team
and our consul general was killed.

20:09.360 --> 20:12.040
You're gonna tell me who was responsible.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.960
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Really?

20:15.040 --> 20:20.760
Then why were you being transported here
by helicopter from CTU Los Angeles?

20:20.840 --> 20:23.360
- You don't know where I came from.
- Actually, I do.

20:23.440 --> 20:28.720
Before entering CTU earlier tonight,
we turned our satellite on that location.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.920
While I was questioning your superiors,

20:31.000 --> 20:34.520
our satellite picked up someone
being taken away by helicopter.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.040
So what? That wasn't me.

20:37.120 --> 20:39.320
No, it was you!

20:39.400 --> 20:41.720
The Chinese government insists

20:41.800 --> 20:45.720
that someone take responsibility
for the death of our consul.

20:45.800 --> 20:49.360
What does that mean, "take responsibility"?

20:49.440 --> 20:52.800
Now, I believe
you were only following orders.

20:52.880 --> 20:56.800
Tell us who gave you orders
and I'll let you go.

20:56.880 --> 20:59.040
I'm not telling you anything.

21:12.600 --> 21:15.840
I believe you're gonna change your mind.

21:25.080 --> 21:27.400
- Yes?
- " Have you redeployed your men?"

21:27.480 --> 21:31.200
- Yes, I have.
- Bill, it's Jack. Uplink is on.

21:31.280 --> 21:34.000
You sure they followed
your instructions?

21:34.080 --> 21:36.960
- " I'm sure."
- It's starting to rain pretty hard.

21:37.040 --> 21:39.040
Michelle...

21:39.480 --> 21:41.360
do you love Tony?

21:43.240 --> 21:45.720
- Yes, I love him.
- "Good."

21:46.200 --> 21:50.160
If I find out you're trying to play me,
the first thing I'll do is blow his brains out.

21:50.240 --> 21:54.280
Don't think there's anything you can do
to stop it. There's not. You understand?

21:54.360 --> 21:57.880
- OK. I understand.
- "Good. Stay by the phone."

21:59.840 --> 22:04.000
" All com analysts, clone that call
and filter it through all our servers.

22:04.080 --> 22:06.960
- Do you have multiple source?
- No, just one feed, low res.

22:07.040 --> 22:10.680
I know the configuration, Edgar.
I need to know if we can multiplex.

22:10.760 --> 22:13.520
- We need to pinpoint the source.
- I was gonna do that.

22:13.600 --> 22:16.880
This is happening now.
I shouldn't have to walk you through this.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.520
- Dammit!
- You don't have to. I'm setting it up now.

22:19.600 --> 22:22.560
Go to Delta two, Edgar. It's all there.

22:22.640 --> 22:27.280
I will not let this thing fall apart
because of technical incompetence.

22:31.560 --> 22:35.320
All right. All our visible forces
have been pulled away from this street.

22:35.400 --> 22:37.160
OK, good.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.320
" Jack.

22:50.680 --> 22:53.640
We've got something.
Building three, west entrance.

22:53.720 --> 22:55.800
Edgar, video feed.

23:02.880 --> 23:05.040
- Yes.
- " OK, we're on our way.

23:05.120 --> 23:07.560
- OK, it's them.
- " I've got a gun on Tony.

23:07.640 --> 23:10.080
My finger's on the trigger.
If I move it, he'll die.

23:10.160 --> 23:12.440
I told you, I moved my men.

23:16.040 --> 23:20.400
She's completely in the open. She's running
a huge risk exposing herself like that.

23:25.440 --> 23:30.760
- " So far, so good.
- She's crossing the street.

23:30.840 --> 23:34.480
When she gets near the car, she can't
stay on top of him. That's our chance.

23:34.560 --> 23:39.560
- She's moving towards the black jag.
- All teams, hold your position.

23:39.640 --> 23:43.400
" Here's the deal. Once we're in the car
and have cleared the area,

23:43.480 --> 23:46.720
I'm gonna call you and I'm gonna tell you
where you can find Tony.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.000
OK.

23:54.640 --> 23:58.400
- All right, move. Everybody, move.
- Bill, not yet! All teams, stand down.

23:58.480 --> 24:04.360
" I see your men. You lied to me, you
bitch. You are not gonna take me alive, got it?

24:05.320 --> 24:07.240
No! No!

24:28.440 --> 24:32.440
Bill, they're gone. She blew herself up
in the car. She took Tony with her.

24:32.520 --> 24:34.760
They're gone.

24:57.920 --> 25:04.040
- Bill Buchanan requested a conference call.
- Yes, sir. We were waiting for you to begin.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.960
- Bill, we're all here. Go ahead.
- "I'm afraid that Marwan's associate,"

25:09.040 --> 25:11.840
the woman we hoped
would help us locate the missile,

25:11.920 --> 25:14.120
has killed herself and one of our agents.

25:14.200 --> 25:16.200
Oh, my God.

25:16.280 --> 25:20.120
Bill, did she leave behind
any physical evidence that could help us?

25:20.200 --> 25:22.000
It doesn't appear so.

25:22.080 --> 25:25.120
So, what is CTU gonna do now
to find the missile?

25:25.200 --> 25:27.400
Mr President, at this point,

25:28.080 --> 25:34.280
CTU has no reasonable expectation of finding
the missile before it reaches its target.

25:34.680 --> 25:38.560
This is it. It's going to happen.
What do we do?

25:39.000 --> 25:43.680
At this point we have no choice
but to alert all state and federal agencies

25:43.760 --> 25:47.640
and focus all our resources
on managing the aftermath.

25:47.720 --> 25:50.360
But we don't even know the missile's target.

25:50.440 --> 25:55.120
I know. We can assume it will be a major city,
but no matter what the target is,

25:55.200 --> 25:58.720
there will be widespread panic
across this country.

25:58.800 --> 26:02.640
We need to mobilise the army
and the National Guard in every state

26:02.720 --> 26:05.480
and draw up a declaration of martial law.

26:06.560 --> 26:08.600
Yes, we need to do that.

26:09.640 --> 26:10.760
Bill.

26:10.840 --> 26:15.200
All federal agencies need to prepare
for the aftermath of a nuclear attack.

26:15.280 --> 26:18.960
CTU's priority should be
disaster management.

26:19.040 --> 26:22.400
- Redeploy your people now.
- Understood.

26:26.320 --> 26:27.320
Edgar Stiles.

26:27.400 --> 26:31.800
Tell Jack the field operation is over. Have him
bring his people back here immediately.

26:31.880 --> 26:33.640
Got it.

26:36.720 --> 26:42.600
The worst disaster in this country's history
has taken place on my watch.

26:43.800 --> 26:47.120
I gave you the responsibility to stop this.

26:47.920 --> 26:50.080
You've failed me, David,

26:50.160 --> 26:52.760
and you've failed your country.

27:34.480 --> 27:38.120
I can't even imagine
what you must be feeling.

27:38.200 --> 27:42.720
I know part of you is second-guessing
your decision...

27:44.640 --> 27:47.480
but you couldn't place Tony's life

27:47.560 --> 27:50.840
before the lives of
potentially millions of people.

27:50.920 --> 27:55.120
You made exactly the decision Tony would
have wanted you to make. That's our job.

27:55.200 --> 27:57.480
That's why we sign on.

28:01.880 --> 28:04.760
We decided we were gonna leave this.

28:06.400 --> 28:09.160
Go somewhere and start again.

28:11.360 --> 28:14.560
- Michelle.
- I wanna get to work and find this missile.

28:14.640 --> 28:18.400
- No, no. I want you to go home.
- I'll be OK, Bill.

28:19.280 --> 28:22.320
It's not advice. It's an order.

28:34.240 --> 28:37.080
- Buchanan.
- Sir, Jack said he's not pulling his men out.

28:37.160 --> 28:40.640
- We have orders from the White House.
- Yeah, but he says he's not ready.

28:40.720 --> 28:43.480
Put him on the videophone
in the situation room.

28:44.760 --> 28:50.760
You lied to me, you bitch.
You are not gonna take me alive, got it?

28:52.440 --> 28:54.800
Play it again.
Give me more volume on the phone.

28:54.880 --> 28:56.400
- We need to redeploy.
- Do it!

28:56.480 --> 28:58.120
Jack.

28:58.960 --> 29:01.400
Tony's gone.

29:02.680 --> 29:06.640
I'm sorry, Curtis.
Look, just play it again, please.

29:07.320 --> 29:08.720
Yeah.

29:13.680 --> 29:17.200
Jack, you've got a phone call.

29:17.280 --> 29:19.920
- This is Bauer.
- "Jack, why haven't you redeployed?"

29:20.000 --> 29:22.840
- "The operation's over."
- Because it doesn't make any sense.

29:22.920 --> 29:26.920
Everything we know about this woman
tells us she's a professional, not a fanatic.

29:27.000 --> 29:31.520
We had her cornered. Her next move was
to negotiate for her freedom, not kill herself.

29:31.600 --> 29:34.280
In theory I agree with you,
but you saw what I saw.

29:34.360 --> 29:38.280
All I saw were two darkened figures
concealed by an umbrella in an explosion,

29:38.360 --> 29:40.760
and I saw that from half a block away.

29:40.840 --> 29:45.240
Jack, you've got to focus now. Nobody here
is holding you responsible for Tony's death.

29:45.320 --> 29:47.960
- "Let this go."
- You're not listening. All I want...

29:48.040 --> 29:52.960
We reviewed the tactical feed.
There's nothing to suggest we were deceived.

29:53.040 --> 29:55.400
Look, I know Tony was your friend,

29:55.480 --> 29:58.640
and you probably feel responsible
for getting him involved...

29:58.720 --> 30:04.080
This is not about Tony! This is about her,
and until I can absolutely confirm she is dead,

30:04.160 --> 30:07.760
I am maintaining this perimeter
and I am gonna continue this search.

30:07.840 --> 30:09.920
I'm under orders from the White House.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.160
You have ten minutes,
then I want you to move out.

30:15.440 --> 30:18.640
- Can you enhance the image from here?
- Not in the field.

30:18.720 --> 30:21.360
Then play it again.

30:23.760 --> 30:27.920
- " Here's the deal."
- I still can't hear properly. Give me a headset.

30:28.000 --> 30:33.240
... l'm gonna call you and I'm gonna tell you
where you can find Tony.

30:38.640 --> 30:41.800
I see your men. You lied to me, you bitch.

30:41.880 --> 30:44.920
You are not gonna take me alive, got it?

30:47.760 --> 30:50.400
- Play back the last 15 seconds.
- What are you seeing?

30:50.480 --> 30:53.640
It's not what I'm seeing.
Come on, play it back.

30:56.560 --> 30:59.480
I see your men. You lied to me, you bitch.

30:59.560 --> 31:02.360
It's pouring rain.
You see it bouncing off the car.

31:02.440 --> 31:06.720
- You can't hear it on her side of the call.
- She was making that call from indoors.

31:06.800 --> 31:09.680
She'd want a position
with a clean line of sight to the car.

31:09.760 --> 31:13.440
That would put her in the building
the couple exited from. Get teams ready.

31:13.520 --> 31:16.520
All teams, we're gonna converge
on building 11.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.440
- " Converge on building 11."
- " Copy that."

31:25.680 --> 31:31.680
Well, they're heading back in.
Looks like my neighbours died for nothing.

31:33.600 --> 31:36.920
They know you're still in here.

31:39.960 --> 31:42.320
Open up the palm of your hand.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.600
Here are the keys.

31:45.360 --> 31:47.680
Take off your cuffs.

31:52.120 --> 31:55.280
Put these on. We're getting outta here.

32:09.440 --> 32:11.800
OK, now cuff yourself back up.

32:15.760 --> 32:17.840
Let's go.

33:01.800 --> 33:05.080
We've got every way in and out covered
and men going room by room.

33:05.160 --> 33:07.800
- We need to take her alive.
- Everyone's aware.

33:07.880 --> 33:11.000
Agent Bauer.
We found fresh blood outside an apartment.

33:11.080 --> 33:12.520
- Where?
- "208."

33:12.600 --> 33:15.080
- Stand down until we get there.
- "Copy that."

33:19.680 --> 33:22.120
Curtis, take the door.

33:33.200 --> 33:35.240
Curtis, she went this way.

34:14.639 --> 34:16.840
Turn around.

34:18.800 --> 34:21.120
Move.

34:22.840 --> 34:25.159
" Don't move! Drop the gun.

34:25.239 --> 34:28.360
- It's over.
- Take one more step and I'll kill him.

34:28.440 --> 34:30.880
Do it, Jack. Do what you have to do.

34:30.960 --> 34:32.800
" Shut up.

34:32.880 --> 34:38.760
Do you really have what it takes to let me
kill him while you're looking him in the eye?

34:39.520 --> 34:40.639
Yes.

34:42.960 --> 34:44.960
I believe you.

34:45.679 --> 34:48.679
So what's to stop me from shooting him?

34:53.239 --> 34:55.159
You can't...

34:55.239 --> 34:57.040
kill me,

34:57.120 --> 34:58.720
can you?

34:59.920 --> 35:02.000
You need me.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.320
Tony.

35:14.160 --> 35:17.400
Hostile is down. I repeat, the hostile is down.

35:17.480 --> 35:22.520
Get a medic down here.
I want her conscious as soon as possible.

35:23.840 --> 35:25.920
Look at me. Are you OK?

35:26.000 --> 35:27.600
Are you OK?

35:27.680 --> 35:28.640
Yeah.

35:30.960 --> 35:34.400
- Get me that medic now!
- " He's on his way.

35:34.480 --> 35:36.440
Does Michelle know I'm alive?

35:36.520 --> 35:40.640
No, not yet. I'll call CTU on my cell
so you can talk to her privately.

35:41.040 --> 35:42.960
Thanks.

35:44.520 --> 35:46.080
- "Buchanan."
- This is Jack.

35:46.160 --> 35:48.320
Jack, have you redeployed back to CTU?

35:48.400 --> 35:51.080
- No. We just apprehended the hostile.
- What?

35:51.160 --> 35:54.080
She's unconscious but she's unharmed.
Tony's OK too.

35:54.160 --> 35:56.520
Thank God. I'll alert the White House.

35:56.600 --> 36:00.520
OK, good. Bill, Tony wants to talk to Michelle.
Can you put her on the line?

36:00.600 --> 36:04.320
She's not here. I sent her home.
I'll find her and patch her through.

36:04.400 --> 36:06.320
Thanks.

36:31.360 --> 36:33.520
- Hello?
- "Michelle, it's Bill."

36:34.400 --> 36:37.040
Tony's alive.

36:37.120 --> 36:39.840
- What?
- "He wasn't in the car."

36:39.920 --> 36:41.720
He's OK.

36:42.520 --> 36:46.040
I'll let Tony explain to you.
Hold on for him.

36:47.160 --> 36:49.440
Michelle, it's me.

36:50.920 --> 36:52.840
Tony.

36:53.720 --> 36:56.240
- Oh, my God.
- "It's OK, sweetheart."

36:56.320 --> 36:58.160
Oh, my God.

36:58.240 --> 37:01.960
- What happened?
- She made somebody else wear my clothes.

37:02.040 --> 37:05.840
She needed to keep me alive until she got out.
Jack figured it out.

37:05.920 --> 37:08.560
He was able to save me.

37:10.640 --> 37:14.320
- I don't know what to say.
- You don't have to say anything, sweetheart.

37:14.400 --> 37:17.440
I'm coming to CTU right now.
I'll see you in a few minutes.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.440
Michelle.

37:20.680 --> 37:22.920
I love you.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.240
I love you, Tony.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.960
Get Palmer patched through.
We'll have to structure a deal.

37:33.040 --> 37:34.880
- All right.
- She's conscious.

37:34.960 --> 37:37.920
Pick her up.
Call the White House now.

37:43.240 --> 37:45.240
Where is Marwan?

37:48.120 --> 37:50.040
That's what I thought.

37:50.120 --> 37:52.280
We're both professionals.

37:52.360 --> 37:56.520
You know that I can force this information
outta you, but I'm running outta time.

37:56.600 --> 37:59.640
We never get second chances in our work,
but I'll give you one.

37:59.720 --> 38:02.960
I have the power to give you a deal
signed by the president

38:03.040 --> 38:06.160
that grants you immunity
from past and present crimes.

38:06.240 --> 38:12.240
In exchange, you can help me find Marwan
and stop this warhead from hitting its target.

38:14.240 --> 38:16.120
Do you understand?

38:17.000 --> 38:19.360
You are either gonna help me now,

38:19.920 --> 38:22.400
or I will kill you.

38:29.120 --> 38:30.920
Show me the deal.

38:43.560 --> 38:46.920
You were part of the team
that mounted the assault on our consulate,

38:47.000 --> 38:50.920
an operation that resulted
in the death of our consul.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.800
Who lead the mission?

38:53.880 --> 38:57.160
- Who was responsible?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

38:57.240 --> 38:59.920
Please, Mr Bern, you're wasting time.

39:00.000 --> 39:02.560
Give us a statement and we'll release you.

39:02.640 --> 39:07.680
I'm telling the truth. You'll have to release me
when CTU realises what's happened to me.

39:07.760 --> 39:11.640
Actually, Mr Bern, no one will ever know.

39:11.720 --> 39:14.240
No one will ever tell them.

39:17.600 --> 39:19.720
What are you talking about?

39:19.800 --> 39:23.320
The "China Queen" container ship
is moored at the port of San Diego.

39:23.400 --> 39:25.440
If you don't give us our statement,

39:25.520 --> 39:30.480
we'll put you on board and you will arrive
in 18 days in the port of Guangzhou.

39:30.560 --> 39:35.760
Then we will transport you 2800 miles
to the province of Xinjiang

39:35.840 --> 39:41.960
where you will be remanded to the maximum
security labour camp on the Siberian border.

39:43.160 --> 39:47.960
- You wouldn't do that.
- Why wouldn't we, Mr Bern? We wantjustice.

39:48.400 --> 39:52.640
If you won't tell us who is ultimately
responsible for the situation at the consulate,

39:52.720 --> 39:55.120
that leaves you.

39:55.200 --> 39:58.800
Your wife and your two daughters
will not be notified.

39:58.880 --> 40:01.760
The US government will not be notified.

40:01.840 --> 40:05.600
Therefore, there will be no chance
for prisoner exchange.

40:06.080 --> 40:09.960
There will be positively no chance of escape...

40:11.880 --> 40:14.080
for the rest of your life.

40:32.040 --> 40:34.640
Decide, Mr Bern.

40:34.720 --> 40:37.680
The "China Queen" is on a tight schedule.

40:39.000 --> 40:42.360
- I don't know.
- All we want is a name.

40:42.800 --> 40:45.840
A recorded statement
naming the person responsible

40:45.920 --> 40:48.800
for what happened at the consulate.

40:54.440 --> 40:56.360
Then...

40:58.160 --> 41:00.720
- Then what happens?
- You will walk out of that door.

41:00.800 --> 41:02.880
No. I meant...

41:03.880 --> 41:05.920
to him.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.600
As I said,

41:07.680 --> 41:10.000
all we want is justice.

41:15.840 --> 41:18.000
His name...

41:18.480 --> 41:20.640
is Jack Bauer.

41:44.920 --> 41:48.240
