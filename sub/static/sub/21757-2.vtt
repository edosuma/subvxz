Had sex at, like, 13,000 feet
in an igloo thing.

09:01.200 --> 09:04.200
- Chris Brown is a great guy,
but during service,

09:04.200 --> 09:05.734
I prefer complete silence

09:05.734 --> 09:07.667
so I can concentrate
on planning

09:07.667 --> 09:09.467
the best meal
possible for our guests.

09:09.467 --> 09:11.600
- I've had one girlfriend, ever.

09:11.600 --> 09:15.600
- All right, let's wrap
up the galley.

09:15.600 --> 09:18.600
- Kate? Kate? Can you come up
to the bridge, please?

09:18.600 --> 09:20.200
- Hi.
- How are you?

09:20.200 --> 09:23.200
- Great.
- [chuckling]

09:23.200 --> 09:24.734
Want to trade crew?

09:24.734 --> 09:27.066
My exterior for your interior?

09:27.066 --> 09:28.533
- Wouldn't we just break even?

09:28.533 --> 09:30.467
- It can't continue
the way it is.

09:30.467 --> 09:32.300
- No.
- So, instead of trying to,

09:32.300 --> 09:34.200
like,

09:34.200 --> 09:36.266
teach them things on the fly,
after these guests leave,

09:36.266 --> 09:39.166
I'll snag you a couple of day
workers, let them do the boat.

09:39.166 --> 09:40.700
- Yes.
- And then you can sit down

09:40.700 --> 09:42.734
with your girls and do,
like, stew 101.

09:42.734 --> 09:44.433
- That'd be great. Yeah.
- Book 'em.

09:44.433 --> 09:45.467
- Book 'em, Danno.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.767
- Look at the lovely table.

09:53.767 --> 09:56.200
- Can I get y'all
anything else to drink?

09:56.200 --> 09:57.367
- Could I get
a Mountain Dew, please?

09:57.367 --> 09:59.100
- Sure.

09:59.100 --> 10:00.500
- Nothing prepared me
from culinary school

10:00.500 --> 10:03.166
to pair any food
with Mountain Dew.

10:03.166 --> 10:06.367
I'm gonna do everything I can to
make sure this dinner's a hit.

10:06.367 --> 10:09.200
- We're all set.
- Okay, thank you.

10:09.200 --> 10:11.166
- Thank you.

10:11.166 --> 10:12.734
- This is a tiger shrimp salad
with a ginger dressing.

10:12.734 --> 10:14.233
- These prawns are really good.
- They are.

10:14.233 --> 10:15.767
- Yes.
- They taste amazing.

10:15.767 --> 10:18.100
- Delicious.
- Become a professional washer.

10:18.100 --> 10:19.500
Wash the boat. Wash the dishes.

10:19.500 --> 10:22.133
- We are glorified janitors.

10:22.133 --> 10:25.333
- I'll open up a business
called Washing Things.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.400
Bri's probably priority
number one at this point.

10:27.400 --> 10:29.333
I got a couple moves,
couple tricks.

10:29.333 --> 10:31.500
I'm sure she'll get to see me
make a fool of myself.

10:34.633 --> 10:37.000
- You're all set.
- Grab one, I'll follow with it.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.500
- Thanks, buddy.
- Oh, Dave.

10:39.500 --> 10:42.133
- Thank you very much.
- No Pants for president.

10:42.133 --> 10:43.500
- Thank you so much.
- That is so-- it's beautiful.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.000
- This looks and
smells fantastic.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.266
- [inaudible]
- It's so good.

10:48.266 --> 10:50.066
- Nico? Nico? Lee.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.533
- Go ahead.
- Sky launch, please?

10:51.533 --> 10:54.667
- On my way. Yes, sir.

10:54.667 --> 10:56.533
- When we go into
the dock tomorrow,

10:56.533 --> 11:01.533
I don't want Bruno or Chris
anywhere near the lines.

11:01.533 --> 11:03.400
- Okay.
- I don't want to see them

11:03.400 --> 11:05.700
with anything in their hands
but a mop and a chamois.

11:05.700 --> 11:07.166
- Understood.
- So, take Baker

11:07.166 --> 11:08.567
up forward with you,

11:08.567 --> 11:10.433
and then put Garreth
on the stern,

11:10.433 --> 11:13.166
and Darrien in the spring lines.

11:13.166 --> 11:16.300
- This charter season is
an opportunity for me to step up

11:16.300 --> 11:18.166
and prove I am the boatswain.

11:18.166 --> 11:20.000
If they're not learning,

11:20.000 --> 11:21.667
it looks like I'm not
teaching well enough.

11:21.667 --> 11:23.400
- Sleep well.
- All right.

11:23.400 --> 11:28.033
Have a good night, Cap.
F---. God damn it.

11:28.033 --> 11:30.166
- Coming up....

11:30.166 --> 11:32.033
- If things aren't advancing as
quick enough as they should be,

11:32.033 --> 11:34.000
we're gonna be pretty f---ed.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.433
- So you're saying that
I'm slower than the other guys?

11:35.433 --> 11:36.734
- As of right now, yes.

11:41.166 --> 11:41.567
- They have a craft-brewed

11:41.567 --> 11:42.166
- They have a craft-brewed
Mountain Dew now apparently.

11:44.166 --> 11:45.734
- What?
- I'm not kidding.

11:45.734 --> 11:48.200
- All right. Let's go.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.600
- Careful the [inaudible]
doesn't fall over.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.467
- [inaudible]
- Ooh.

11:51.467 --> 11:53.633
- Mmm. That looks good.
- This is beautiful.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.533
- My favorite deck people.
Take a look at this.

11:57.533 --> 11:59.600
For right now,
this is the morning setup.

11:59.600 --> 12:03.066
This should be done
before 9:00, all right?

12:03.066 --> 12:04.734
- Yeah.
- So, overall,

12:04.734 --> 12:06.533
what did you think about today?

12:06.533 --> 12:09.333
- This is only day two.

12:09.333 --> 12:13.066
I think individually
we're all at different places,

12:13.066 --> 12:16.266
some kind of learning
quicker than others.

12:16.266 --> 12:20.200
- Yeah. I think that's the past
of the time,

12:20.200 --> 12:22.533
we can definitely get there.

12:22.533 --> 12:25.300
- Well, yeah, I mean, but
that time needs to be sped up.

12:26.467 --> 12:29.734
If things aren't advancing as
quick enough as they should be,

12:29.734 --> 12:32.100
we're gonna be pretty f---ed.

12:32.100 --> 12:33.633
- I'm trying to do my best,
though.

12:33.633 --> 12:35.767
I mean, I've never
worked on a yacht.

12:35.767 --> 12:37.767
- We all need to work on things,

12:37.767 --> 12:39.767
but there's other people here
that are catching on quicker.

12:39.767 --> 12:42.600
So you need to be more observant
of what is going on around you.

12:44.700 --> 12:46.300
- As of right now, yes.

12:50.100 --> 12:51.333
- How is that unfair?

12:57.066 --> 12:58.567
- I'm not here to be
a cheerleader,

12:58.567 --> 13:00.033
'cause that's not my job.

13:10.767 --> 13:12.633
- This is a yacht,
and you're new to this,

13:12.633 --> 13:13.734
so let's work on it.

13:14.667 --> 13:15.667
- Okay?

13:19.600 --> 13:22.667
- I want to live
like this always.

13:22.667 --> 13:24.667
I'm gonna bother Kate
for a cup of tea.

13:24.667 --> 13:26.400
- Sure, what kind?

13:26.400 --> 13:27.667
- Chamomile would be perfect,
thank you.

13:27.667 --> 13:29.133
- Chamomile tea?
- Yeah.

13:29.133 --> 13:30.500
- Okay.
- Thanks.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.633
- We're gonna time everything?
- No.

13:32.633 --> 13:36.667
No. No. Yes, 'cause it's gonna,
like, that's kind of--

13:36.667 --> 13:40.500
- Jen, like puppies
or kindergarteners,

13:40.500 --> 13:43.000
visual learning is
the best way to start.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.567
Go. I'm timing you.
Find that tea.

13:47.667 --> 13:49.667
I'm not trying to embarrass her.

13:49.667 --> 13:52.100
I'm trying to make her aware
of how much time she wastes.

13:52.100 --> 13:56.567
Because if she fixes that,
she'd be amazing. Ish.

13:56.567 --> 13:59.166
- [inaudible] Doesn't make me
nervous or anything.

13:59.166 --> 14:01.166
- Captain Lee mentioned that
the sunrise is something.

14:01.166 --> 14:02.567
- Yeah.

14:02.567 --> 14:03.700
- What does she
take her tea with?

14:03.700 --> 14:06.166
Time is ticking. [laughs]

14:06.166 --> 14:07.600
You're so funny.

14:10.433 --> 14:12.400
- Come on, come on, come on.

14:12.400 --> 14:15.533
She just wants to have that tea
when she goes to bed.

14:15.533 --> 14:18.033
Okay.
- Thank you for your help.

14:18.033 --> 14:19.233
- Yeah, we're gonna write
that time down.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.100
At least you make me laugh.

14:21.100 --> 14:24.166
- Thank you so much.
- You are most welcome.

14:24.166 --> 14:27.433
- Have you talked to your family
at all, or--

14:27.433 --> 14:29.233
- Not yet.

14:29.233 --> 14:30.767
Barely even f---ing
even thought about it.

14:30.767 --> 14:33.533
- You got a boyfriend,
girlfriend, best friend?

14:33.533 --> 14:36.400
- No boyfriend but, uh,
yeah, no,

14:36.400 --> 14:38.066
in Charleston, I have
a bunch of homies.

14:38.066 --> 14:40.200
That's like my main base,
and then I kinda

14:40.200 --> 14:43.200
just move around seasonally,
'cause I got this RV.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.033
- How do you afford driving
around in that thing?

14:46.333 --> 14:48.200
'Cause my dad passed away, so...

14:48.200 --> 14:50.600
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
- No, it's all good.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.200
Today's actually his birthday.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.667
- Tonight?
- Happy birthday, Dad.

14:54.667 --> 14:57.433
My relationship
with my dad was very close.

14:57.433 --> 15:00.000
So when my dad passed away,

15:00.000 --> 15:03.200
I kind of changed
my whole outlook on life.

15:03.200 --> 15:06.600
He died, it was actually,
like, almost 10 years ago.

15:06.600 --> 15:10.200
I got a degree in business,
but to me, I think living life,

15:10.200 --> 15:13.333
and making connections
with people

15:13.333 --> 15:16.166
is a lot more important
than settling down.

15:16.166 --> 15:19.066
- Keep on keeping on, huh?
- Yeah.

15:19.066 --> 15:20.600
- Good night.
- I'll be in, like, 6:00 AM,

15:20.600 --> 15:23.166
just to take a shower
in your shower.

15:23.166 --> 15:24.700
- Thanks, Kate.
- In life,

15:24.700 --> 15:26.700
God always finds a balance.

15:26.700 --> 15:30.367
And yes, I have moronic crew,
but he gave me easy guests.

15:30.367 --> 15:33.633
Hallelujah. The coffee machine,
put a filter in.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.233
- Okay.
- Coffee, water.

15:35.233 --> 15:37.033
So all she has to do
is press "on."

15:37.033 --> 15:38.567
- All right.
- Thank you.

15:38.567 --> 15:39.600
- Yes.

15:49.500 --> 15:50.500
- Are you okay?

16:02.066 --> 16:04.133
- It's quite a lot for Nico
at the moment.

16:04.133 --> 16:06.000
He's going through a lot with
his brother and his deck team.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
I feel bad for the guy.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.767
So, if I can be there for him,
no matter how, I'll do it.

16:21.400 --> 16:23.333
- All deck crew,
can you go into the bow?

16:30.100 --> 16:31.533
- Okay.

16:31.533 --> 16:33.467
The guests today
are leaving by tender.

16:33.467 --> 16:36.533
We're not docking with them
on board, all right?

16:36.533 --> 16:39.033
Right now, the guests,
they're gonna have breakfast.

16:39.033 --> 16:41.300
So let's start from the top
and do the wipe down.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.166
Yesterday, Captain Lee
talked to me

16:43.166 --> 16:44.500
and we're just discussing

16:44.500 --> 16:46.567
how we're gonna do
the docking today.

16:46.567 --> 16:49.700
As of right now,
Chris and Bruno,

16:49.700 --> 16:52.433
he doesn't want you guys
touching the lines at all.

16:52.433 --> 16:54.300
That's just the way it is.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.033
- If he doesn't think I have
the knowledge

16:56.033 --> 16:57.700
and the skill
to handle the lines,

16:57.700 --> 17:00.300
I have no problem,
like, not working, I guess.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.166
I want to learn, man.

17:02.166 --> 17:03.433
If I'm standing around
for the next six weeks

17:03.433 --> 17:05.266
watching the captain do the job

17:05.266 --> 17:06.700
that I should be doing,
I'll feel like an idiot.

17:06.700 --> 17:08.300
- Let's do it.
- Do it.

17:08.300 --> 17:10.633
- Thanks, guys.
- Good morning.

17:10.633 --> 17:13.433
- How's your wrist this morning?
- It is painful.

17:13.433 --> 17:16.400
- You should ice it
every chance you get.

17:16.400 --> 17:17.700
- I'm giving them a BELT.

17:17.700 --> 17:19.333
- A belt?
- Like a BLT with egg.

17:19.333 --> 17:22.600
- Bacon, egg, lettuce, tomato?
- Sorry.

17:22.600 --> 17:24.333
Bacon, lettuce, tomato, cheese.

17:24.333 --> 17:25.700
- Bacon, egg, tomato, cheese?
- Tomato, cheese.

17:25.700 --> 17:27.233
- No lettuce?
- No lettuce.

17:29.467 --> 17:32.700
- This is bacon, egg, with Swiss
and cheddar.

17:32.700 --> 17:34.333
- Oh, it's beautiful.
- This is delicious.

17:34.333 --> 17:35.734
- Mmm.

17:35.734 --> 17:37.400
- What are the last
couple things

17:37.400 --> 17:39.400
we're gonna check off
the list here?

17:39.400 --> 17:42.000
- We're gonna try and do a sumo
off the tip of the bow.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.133
- Would the sumo go better
down the slide,

17:44.133 --> 17:46.400
so it won't explode,
maybe, upon impact?

17:46.400 --> 17:48.533
- I feel like the explosion's
coming either way.

17:48.533 --> 17:49.767
[laughing]

17:58.700 --> 18:00.066
[inaudible]

18:00.066 --> 18:02.233
- Oh, I think it might pop.

18:02.233 --> 18:03.467
Can I touch?

18:03.467 --> 18:05.367
- That's quite forward of you.

18:05.367 --> 18:07.467
I ate a lot of Matt's breakfast.
It was spectacular.

18:07.467 --> 18:09.333
- The grey hat.

18:11.467 --> 18:13.233
- Will you do me a favor?
- Yes.

18:13.233 --> 18:14.600
- [laughing]

18:14.600 --> 18:18.633
- Already?
- Oh, you're so funny.

18:18.633 --> 18:22.100
Can you please iron
all the white athletic shirts

18:22.100 --> 18:23.367
in the laundry room?

18:23.367 --> 18:25.066
- Yes, thank you.
- Uh-huh?

18:25.066 --> 18:27.500
- That was on my to-do list.
- Oh, good.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.100
- [laughing] What's going on?
- I'm sorry.

18:29.100 --> 18:32.467
- Oh my--
- What the heck is going on?

18:32.467 --> 18:34.100
I don't really think
I'm that funny.

18:34.100 --> 18:36.500
- Let's do this.
- You guys are ridiculous.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.300
I love it.

18:38.300 --> 18:41.066
- This is gonna hurt so bad.
- Three, two, one.

18:41.066 --> 18:42.433
both: Konnichiwa!

18:51.266 --> 18:52.667
- Life's either memorable
or forgettable,

18:52.667 --> 18:55.100
and these guests
are very invested

18:55.100 --> 18:56.266
in making life memorable,

18:56.266 --> 18:58.266
which I highly respect.

18:58.266 --> 19:00.533
- Got some cankles going here.
- Attention all crew.

19:00.533 --> 19:03.600
Water taxi arrives in 1/2
an hour. 1/2 an hour, guys.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.133
- Copy.
- Good work.

19:05.133 --> 19:06.500
- Thank you.
- No worries.

19:06.500 --> 19:09.066
- I'm beat.
- Did y'all get a chance

19:09.066 --> 19:11.000
to do these pantalones?

19:11.000 --> 19:12.767
- Are those the ones you were
just laying down here?

19:12.767 --> 19:14.400
- Like an hour ago.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.000
- Go change. I'll iron it.
- Okay.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.533
- On to the next adventure?
- Yeah.

19:17.533 --> 19:19.033
- It's so sad.

19:21.467 --> 19:23.500
- Our water
taxi's approaching.

19:23.500 --> 19:25.467
- Copy.
- I'll take this.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.433
- Here we go. Lead it off, Nico.

19:30.433 --> 19:32.266
- Let me stand next
to you girls.

19:34.367 --> 19:35.700
- Thank you for coming.

19:35.700 --> 19:37.266
- Oh my gosh, Nico.
- Goodbye.

19:37.266 --> 19:38.700
- Take care.
- Yeah, I loved it.

19:38.700 --> 19:40.300
- Thank you so much.
- It was fun.

19:40.300 --> 19:41.700
- It was great, yeah.
- [inaudible]

19:41.700 --> 19:44.233
- Thanks very much.
- Captain Lee.

19:44.233 --> 19:46.700
Captain, thank you so much.
It was so much fun.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.433
We may not have
been the easiest.

19:48.433 --> 19:49.533
We're always asking
to jump off the roof.

19:49.533 --> 19:51.166
Thank you very, very much.

19:51.166 --> 19:52.500
Sir, that's for you,
for you guys.

19:52.500 --> 19:53.667
- Thank you.
We really appreciate it.

19:53.667 --> 19:55.166
- And hope we see you soon.

19:55.166 --> 19:56.767
- Thank you.

19:56.767 --> 19:58.700
- We got lucky that these guys
were so nice.

19:58.700 --> 20:00.567
Because if they weren't
so amazing,

20:00.567 --> 20:02.233
we would've been screwed.

20:02.233 --> 20:07.333
- Lines out. Lines out.
all: Bye. Bye.

20:07.333 --> 20:09.333
- Let's get ready to pull
the anchor and get out of here.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.066
- All right, let's change back.
Change over quickly.

20:12.066 --> 20:15.133
We've got a lot--
we've got work to do.

20:15.133 --> 20:17.467
- Coming up...
- I don't for a second believe

20:17.467 --> 20:21.600
that everybody in this crew
performed up to their potential.

20:21.600 --> 20:28.266
There will be consequences.

20:28.333 --> 20:28.600
- All right, guys,

20:28.600 --> 20:29.133
- All right, guys,
let's get out of here.

20:30.333 --> 20:32.200
- Roger.

20:32.200 --> 20:33.667
- You don't need me, do you?
- She's in the hole.

20:33.667 --> 20:35.433
- Perfect.
- Let's do this, mate.

20:35.433 --> 20:37.734
- Copy, Captain,
[inaudible] in the water.

20:37.734 --> 20:40.734
It's at the waterline,
and pretty clean.

20:40.734 --> 20:42.734
Okay, you're good.

20:42.734 --> 20:44.467
- Get out of that hole.
- All right.

20:44.467 --> 20:47.533
Let's get the boat back
to St. Martin.

20:47.533 --> 20:51.100
- Charter one done.
- Yeah. I hate fitted sheets.

20:51.100 --> 20:52.700
Folding fitted sheets
drives me crazy.

20:52.700 --> 20:54.767
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

20:54.767 --> 20:58.233
Golly. Jen versus pillow.

20:58.233 --> 21:00.367
- Who's gonna win?
- There was a miscommunication.

21:00.367 --> 21:02.066
I was helping her
with the pillow,

21:02.066 --> 21:04.233
but I put the big
square pillow in the sham.

21:04.233 --> 21:07.633
I was like, what the?

21:07.633 --> 21:10.433
- So, Kate has been messing
with you too.

21:10.433 --> 21:12.166
- Yes. Yes, she has.

21:12.166 --> 21:13.367
I give her the giggles,
which is funny,

21:13.367 --> 21:14.767
'cause it makes me laugh too.

21:14.767 --> 21:16.734
But it was almost, like,
laughing at me

21:16.734 --> 21:18.700
instead of with me
kind of thing.

21:18.700 --> 21:25.200
Kate has a very special way
of making you feel inferior.

21:25.200 --> 21:29.266
I don't know what her agenda is,
but I'm gonna be the idiot,

21:29.266 --> 21:31.667
and I'm gonna
make her the idiot.

21:31.667 --> 21:34.333
Maybe, I don't know.
It's all good.

21:36.400 --> 21:38.400
- What is that little f---ing
sailboat doing,

21:38.400 --> 21:39.633
that little prick?

21:46.133 --> 21:48.000
- Bruno? Want to help them

21:48.000 --> 21:50.533
just bring stuff down
instead of plating yourself?

21:50.533 --> 21:52.233
- [exhales heavily]

21:57.667 --> 22:00.533
- Everyone has this
mentality onboard

22:00.533 --> 22:03.200
that they can just speak
to you directly,

22:03.200 --> 22:05.734
like they don't care
about your feelings.

22:05.734 --> 22:07.633
In previous places
that I've worked,

22:07.633 --> 22:09.667
I was never, you know,
talked like that.

22:09.667 --> 22:11.266
- Where'd Bruno go?

22:11.266 --> 22:12.300
- Cabin.

22:16.033 --> 22:18.567
- Bruno?
Are you gonna have lunch?

22:18.567 --> 22:20.567
- No. Not feeling like.

22:20.567 --> 22:24.567
- I can make a plate for you.
- No, that's fine.

22:24.567 --> 22:27.133
- How's Bruno?
- He's in the bathroom.

22:27.133 --> 22:28.467
- [sniffling]

22:33.233 --> 22:35.300
- That tender will take you all
the way till we get to the dock?

22:35.300 --> 22:38.033
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, Bruno's up there now,

22:38.033 --> 22:40.033
so just give him a hand
and continue to wash.

22:43.133 --> 22:45.567
- Let's get this bad
boy cleaned up.

22:45.567 --> 22:47.500
- Yeah.

22:50.033 --> 22:52.433
- So you worked on a cruise ship
for five years.

22:52.433 --> 22:54.333
- Oh, yeah.
Everything is different.

22:54.333 --> 22:56.266
Some stuff,

22:56.266 --> 22:57.600
they just don't tolerate on
board big cruise ships.

22:57.600 --> 22:59.066
- Like what?
- The way they talk

22:59.066 --> 23:00.734
to each other, for example.

23:00.734 --> 23:03.600
To be honest, I've just been
feeling really disrespect.

23:03.600 --> 23:07.467
- Is it Nico, or--
- Doesn't matter who it is.

23:07.467 --> 23:08.734
I know that things
need to be done,

23:08.734 --> 23:10.467
but they're not gonna

23:10.467 --> 23:12.467
get done faster
if you bring someone down.

23:12.467 --> 23:15.600
- Yachting just attracts, like,
one type of people, you know?

23:15.600 --> 23:17.300
- What, jerks?

23:17.300 --> 23:19.033
- Loud, outspoken people who,

23:19.033 --> 23:20.600
like, know what
they want to do, and--

23:20.600 --> 23:23.000
- Well, that doesn't mean
that you can, you know...

23:23.000 --> 23:24.400
- You can be a jerk?
- Exactly.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.166
- Obviously, Captain's
been hard on us.

23:26.166 --> 23:28.200
Nico's been hard on us
for a very good reason.

23:28.200 --> 23:30.400
And I'm taking it in stride.
I'm supposed to get sh-- on.

23:30.400 --> 23:32.333
That's part of my job.

23:32.333 --> 23:34.633
If you need somebody
to say pleasantries to you

23:34.633 --> 23:37.600
while working, this might not be
the industry for you.

23:37.600 --> 23:40.500
- At the end of the day,
we are here for the same thing.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.100
- Love of the ocean, right?

23:42.100 --> 23:43.600
- Yeah.
- No, man.

23:43.600 --> 23:45.200
I'm here for the money.

23:49.100 --> 23:51.500
- Cap, your bow is just now
clearing the catamaran.

23:51.500 --> 23:53.100
- Copy that. I'm headed in.

23:53.100 --> 23:54.767
- You ready?
- Yeah.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.633
I'm definitely nervous
about docking today.

23:56.633 --> 23:58.500
It's been a while,
so I'm like, all right, Baker.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.300
Don't f--- up. Don't f--- up.
Don't f--- up.

24:00.300 --> 24:02.567
- Hold on. Hold on. Lock it off.

24:02.567 --> 24:04.567
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

24:07.233 --> 24:08.333
- There you go.

24:10.066 --> 24:11.066
- Yeah.

24:14.633 --> 24:15.633
- Yeah.
- Nico, I've got a stern line

24:15.633 --> 24:17.667
on pretty taut.

24:17.667 --> 24:19.600
Let me get one more small
kick in, and I'll be good.

24:19.600 --> 24:21.133
- Pull?
- Pull, pull, pull, pull, pull.

24:21.133 --> 24:22.400
Pull, pull.

24:22.400 --> 24:24.133
Tighten up a bit.

24:24.133 --> 24:25.500
- Tighten it?
- Tight, tight, tight, tight.

24:25.500 --> 24:28.633
- That's good.
- Good job.

24:28.633 --> 24:31.400
- All right. High five.
- Lines look good as well.

24:31.400 --> 24:33.533
- Yeah. Thank you.
- All right.

24:33.533 --> 24:34.767
- Thank you.
- Baker's gonna be the girl

24:34.767 --> 24:36.400
that I can count on.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.133
She's stepping up.
She's got good vibes.

24:38.133 --> 24:39.767
She's got good energy,
and she works hard.

24:47.400 --> 24:49.400
So what have you been up to,
last two years ago,

24:49.400 --> 24:51.133
I think it was?
- I don't know.

24:51.133 --> 24:54.133
I went to Hawaii for,
like, four months,

24:54.133 --> 24:56.400
and went home for a little bit.

24:56.400 --> 24:58.700
Now I'm living in L.A.

24:58.700 --> 25:00.667
- Who are you staying there
with? By yourself?

25:00.667 --> 25:03.100
- Yeah, by myself.
- That's cool.

25:03.100 --> 25:04.567
- I hear that you're
in a relationship?

25:04.567 --> 25:06.700
- Yeah.
- How is it?

25:06.700 --> 25:08.700
Like, while working, you know,
going away for so long, and--

25:08.700 --> 25:10.533
- You know,
it's pretty difficult.

25:10.533 --> 25:13.433
Always being away,
always having the temptation.

25:13.433 --> 25:16.300
It's been working so far.

25:16.300 --> 25:18.367
- It's pretty funny
that you said so far.

25:25.700 --> 25:27.700
- You got it?

25:27.700 --> 25:29.700
- Have you talked to Bruno
or what? He seemed pretty upset.

25:29.700 --> 25:30.767
- No. What happened?

25:30.767 --> 25:32.700
- I don't know, man.

25:32.700 --> 25:34.166
He was, like, sniffling or
crying or something, you know?

25:34.166 --> 25:35.567
- Why?
- I don't know.

25:35.567 --> 25:37.433
I mean, yachting's not
for everybody.

25:37.433 --> 25:39.266
- I'll make sure he's all right.
I'll talk to him.

25:39.266 --> 25:41.200
- Attention all crew.

25:41.200 --> 25:42.734
I need everybody down
in the crew mess now.

25:42.734 --> 25:45.734
[tense music]

25:45.734 --> 25:49.467
♪ ♪

25:49.467 --> 25:52.300
- Captain Lee doesn't
hide his emotions well.

25:52.300 --> 25:55.200
It's pretty clear
we're in trouble.

25:55.200 --> 25:59.533
- I think this charter
was easier

25:59.533 --> 26:01.600
because the people were easy.

26:01.600 --> 26:06.333
I don't for a second believe
that everybody in this crew

26:06.333 --> 26:09.400
performed up to their potential.

26:09.400 --> 26:12.400
If you want to progress,
you're gonna have to earn it.

26:12.400 --> 26:16.567
I want to see some solid effort
moving in the right direction,

26:16.567 --> 26:19.033
or there will be consequences.

26:20.433 --> 26:24.033
That being said,
we do have some money.

26:25.767 --> 26:29.633
15 grand. $1,360 each.

26:29.633 --> 26:31.500
- That's so nice of them.
- That's pretty amazing.

26:31.500 --> 26:33.600
- I'll take it.
- That tip really feels good.

26:33.600 --> 26:37.500
It's like, the recognition
that I wasn't getting.

26:37.500 --> 26:39.166
- It's pretty good.
- Yeah.

26:39.166 --> 26:40.700
- Considering everything.
- And trust me.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.100
For those of you who feel
you didn't earn your tip

26:42.100 --> 26:44.100
this time around, you will.

26:44.100 --> 26:46.367
I guarantee it.

26:46.367 --> 26:49.166
- This tip is generous.
I mean, I'm not complaining.

26:49.166 --> 26:53.600
However, I am disappointed
that the crew doesn't realize

26:53.600 --> 26:56.033
they should probably
all give a lot more to me.

26:56.033 --> 26:57.767
This was not
equally earned, y'all.

26:57.767 --> 27:00.734
- You guys can go out tonight.
Tomorrow is a work day.

27:00.734 --> 27:03.100
Whatever you consume tonight,

27:03.100 --> 27:05.266
I will be sweating out of you
tomorrow morning

27:05.266 --> 27:07.200
bright and early.

27:07.200 --> 27:08.667
Have a good time
tonight, guys.

27:08.667 --> 27:10.033
all: Thanks, Captain.
- All right.

27:13.400 --> 27:17.000
- What's up, dude?
So you like alcohol.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.000
You like to party.
You like women.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.533
- I'm the wild card, Nico.

27:21.533 --> 27:24.066
- So what's your ideal
chick, then?

27:24.066 --> 27:25.400
Blonde, brunette, skinny?

27:25.400 --> 27:27.233
- Does anybody know that?

27:27.233 --> 27:28.533
- I mean, you've got to have
some sort of type, dude.

27:28.533 --> 27:30.400
- Blondes, [inaudible].

27:30.400 --> 27:32.400
- Well, I guess you got
your pickings here, right?

27:32.400 --> 27:34.400
- Totally into Bri.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.133
- Yeah, she's hot.

27:36.133 --> 27:39.266
- I'm gonna tell you,
I was celibate for 26 years.

27:39.266 --> 27:43.266
So it's like, I just recently
started being in relationships.

27:43.266 --> 27:45.233
- Whoa. I mean, sh--.

27:48.433 --> 27:50.400
Why'd you do that?

27:50.400 --> 27:51.400
- 'Cause I was like, Christian,
like really Christian.

27:51.400 --> 27:53.166
- Yeah.

27:53.166 --> 27:54.233
- But then you turn like 25,
and you're like, f---.

27:54.233 --> 27:56.133
Love's not a real thing.

27:56.133 --> 27:57.667
- Might fall off if you don't
use it for that long, man.

27:57.667 --> 27:59.400
- Yeah, that's also
what I was afraid of.

27:59.400 --> 28:01.033
- I mean, you want to make sure
it still works.

28:01.033 --> 28:02.700
- Yeah.

28:02.700 --> 28:03.767
You can't be walking around
with a loaded gun

28:03.767 --> 28:05.166
all the time, you know?

28:05.166 --> 28:07.300
- I mean, better
late than never.

28:07.300 --> 28:09.100
- So now if I see a pretty girl,
or someone I want to talk to,

28:09.100 --> 28:10.633
I just go and talk to them,
pursue it.

28:10.633 --> 28:13.233
Growing up, being a Christian
was my identity.

28:13.233 --> 28:16.633
And then your wants and your
desires, it just changes.

28:16.633 --> 28:19.000
And I'm not celibate anymore.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.266
They say, like,
you'll find love eventually,

28:21.266 --> 28:22.700
and you should save yourself.

28:22.700 --> 28:24.700
And then you realize like,
this sucks.

28:24.700 --> 28:28.200
Gave it a good shot, man.
The old college try, 26 years.

28:28.200 --> 28:30.200
- So you're, like,
one of those little Chihuahuas

28:30.200 --> 28:31.433
that got let loose.

28:31.433 --> 28:34.033
- I need to get after it.

28:34.033 --> 28:35.033
- Coming up...

28:36.200 --> 28:38.467
I mean, I was drunk too, but you
were, like, really drunk, right?

28:38.467 --> 28:40.333
- We were both pretty f---ed up.
- There's a connection.

28:40.333 --> 28:41.600
It's pretty obvious.

28:46.767 --> 28:47.400
- What I want you guys to do

28:47.400 --> 28:47.734
- What I want you guys to do
is go from top to bottom.

28:50.133 --> 28:53.600
Open every cupboard.
Look at it. Memorize it.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.467
- Okay.
- Let's go get intimate.

28:55.467 --> 28:59.033
- All right.
- This is really exciting work.

28:59.033 --> 29:00.600
- What the hell?
I didn't know this was here.

29:00.600 --> 29:02.333
Why were these in there?
- I don't know.

29:02.333 --> 29:03.734
All right, I'm gonna hand
these out to you,

29:03.734 --> 29:05.333
just so I can get back here.
- Yeah.

29:05.333 --> 29:07.200
- Hey, we have condoms.
- Oh, hey.

29:07.200 --> 29:10.767
- Only three,
so we have to reuse.

29:10.767 --> 29:12.367
- Yeah.

29:12.367 --> 29:15.166
- So, what are your thoughts
now on the boys?

29:15.166 --> 29:17.100
- Like, looks-wise, I think

29:17.100 --> 29:21.233
that Matt and Nico probably are
the most attractive guys.

29:21.233 --> 29:22.700
- Yeah.
- Being a single mom,

29:22.700 --> 29:24.500
you don't really have time
to stop

29:24.500 --> 29:28.066
and think about
how lonely you really are.

29:28.066 --> 29:31.767
And when you finally lay
your eyes on some eye candy,

29:31.767 --> 29:36.767
you're quickly reminded that
you're so sexually frustrated.

29:36.767 --> 29:38.500
What do you think?

29:38.500 --> 29:41.367
- I don't know. I was--
I'm not really attracted--

29:41.367 --> 29:43.367
- Yeah, I don't think you're
just being fully open with--

29:43.367 --> 29:46.100
it's like, weren't you talking
to Nico about his girlfriend?

29:46.100 --> 29:48.100
I could see you guys
together, though.

29:48.100 --> 29:50.266
And I think that's super cute
that you knew each other before.

29:50.266 --> 29:51.633
Like, what are the odds of that?

29:51.633 --> 29:53.633
- I've spent one
drunken night with him.

29:53.633 --> 29:55.367
- I mean, that's cool.
- And that's it.

29:55.367 --> 29:57.633
I think Nico's adorable,
but he has a girlfriend,

29:57.633 --> 29:59.667
and I'm not gonna get
in the way of that.

29:59.667 --> 30:01.667
- I could see something there.

30:01.667 --> 30:05.500
- I can see some fun
to be had with him, for sure.

30:08.533 --> 30:10.266
- Can you pass me
that amazing tool?

30:10.266 --> 30:12.400
- Yeah. Oh, this is good.
You're multitasking.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.734
You're relaxing.

30:14.734 --> 30:16.633
Do you think that Chris
is gonna get hammered tonight?

30:16.633 --> 30:18.533
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I do too.

30:18.533 --> 30:21.233
- Yeah, that's all he talks
about is ass and alcohol.

30:21.233 --> 30:23.100
- What else do we have
in common?

30:23.100 --> 30:25.533
- I don't know.
- I drink a ton of alcohol.

30:25.533 --> 30:28.100
- We like tequila.
- Yeah.

30:28.100 --> 30:30.367
- And I love ass.
- And then there's bourbon.

30:30.367 --> 30:32.467
Bourbon's 51% corn.

30:33.667 --> 30:35.300
I know a lot about drinking.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.033
- You know what I want
to hear, Chris?

30:37.033 --> 30:38.700
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

30:38.700 --> 30:41.266
- We're turning
into Captain Lee.

30:47.033 --> 30:48.400
[ringtone]

30:48.400 --> 30:50.133
- Hi.
- Hey.

30:50.133 --> 30:51.567
- What's up?
- Nothing. How's it going?

30:51.567 --> 30:53.133
- Good. How are you?

30:53.133 --> 30:55.033
- It's a lot of work
this season.

30:55.033 --> 30:57.433
- Why?
- All the deckhands are green.

30:57.433 --> 30:59.033
- Oh.

30:59.033 --> 31:00.667
- You know,
it's gonna have to be,

31:00.667 --> 31:02.433
like, teaching them
from literally ground zero.

31:02.433 --> 31:04.567
- Yeah?
- I miss you.

31:04.567 --> 31:06.300
- But--I miss you too.

31:06.300 --> 31:08.133
- It's super hard being away
from Melissa.

31:08.133 --> 31:10.266
You know, I'm not really
the most faithful person.

31:10.266 --> 31:12.400
I find you so attractive.

31:12.400 --> 31:16.166
- I'm not that kind of girl,
and you've got a girlfriend.

31:16.166 --> 31:19.300
- But life has changed
dramatically for me.

31:19.300 --> 31:21.333
Hopefully the six weeks
will go by quick.

31:21.333 --> 31:25.433
I'm trying to be a good
boyfriend, good everything.

31:33.033 --> 31:35.533
- Huh?

31:35.533 --> 31:37.200
- Listen, you're breaking up.

31:37.200 --> 31:38.700
I'll message you later tonight.

31:38.700 --> 31:40.300
- All right.
- All right. I love you.

31:40.300 --> 31:41.734
Have a good night.

31:41.734 --> 31:43.400
- All right. Love you too.
- Bye.

31:50.300 --> 31:51.600
- What about this one?

31:54.133 --> 31:56.233
- Too exposed?
- Too ex--

31:56.233 --> 31:57.300
No, but it is, right?

31:57.300 --> 31:59.500
- Bruno is adorable.

31:59.500 --> 32:01.467
He has a great body.

32:01.467 --> 32:03.500
Always walks around half-naked.
He's the best roommate.

32:03.500 --> 32:05.200
You're ripped.
I think you're cool.

32:05.200 --> 32:06.633
It's fine.
- Rahr!

32:06.633 --> 32:07.700
- Yes.

32:12.467 --> 32:15.467
- The plan is, go out, have some
drinks, have some crew dinner,

32:15.467 --> 32:17.333
and then isolate Bri,

32:17.333 --> 32:19.066
see if we can hang out.
It's gonna be a good time.

32:19.066 --> 32:20.567
- First time out in St. Martin.
- Get it on.

32:20.567 --> 32:22.767
- Let's go.
- All right.

32:22.767 --> 32:25.734
- Here we go.
- Ladies, hello.

32:25.734 --> 32:27.467
- Ladies.

32:27.467 --> 32:29.367
- First charter was
a complete sh--show.

32:29.367 --> 32:31.233
But now, I want to go out,

32:31.233 --> 32:33.767
have a few drinks,
no drama, and relax.

32:36.367 --> 32:37.567
[overlapping chatter]

32:40.633 --> 32:41.633
- Yeah.
- Okay.

32:41.633 --> 32:42.633
- I'll let you know.

32:44.400 --> 32:46.266
- These dinner logistics sucked.

32:46.266 --> 32:48.500
I ended up in
the worst spot from Bri.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.333
- Hi, can I have
an Old Fashioned?

32:50.333 --> 32:52.233
- Now I have to actually make
an effort to talk to her.

32:52.233 --> 32:53.767
Not ideal.

32:53.767 --> 32:55.533
- This, like the lighting
on the water?

32:55.533 --> 32:57.367
- Yeah, it's great, isn't it?

33:00.667 --> 33:03.000
- Oh.
- Just saying.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.533
- I had a birthday here
not long ago.

33:04.533 --> 33:05.667

33:05.667 --> 33:08.200
- 31.
- Oh, snaps.

33:08.200 --> 33:10.400
- Ouch.
- Cheers, guys.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.767
all: Cheers.

33:12.767 --> 33:15.000
- Yay.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.333
- Wow.

33:17.333 --> 33:19.500
- It looks good.
- You should name him.

33:19.500 --> 33:20.567
What's his name?

33:20.567 --> 33:23.633
- Rico. Rico Suave.

33:26.767 --> 33:30.300
- Dude. Top shelf bartenders
make such a big difference.

33:30.300 --> 33:32.433
The bar usually speaks
to me, you know?

33:32.433 --> 33:36.300
Can we get a bottle of mezcal
provisioned? Is that a thing?

33:36.300 --> 33:38.700
- Going out to dinner with the
crew is kind of a waste of time.

33:38.700 --> 33:42.533
I'd rather do my taxes.
I would rather clean toilets.

33:42.533 --> 33:45.700
Because at least the toilets
don't make awkward conversation.

33:45.700 --> 33:47.433
- I want to open a tequila bar
in Sweden.

33:47.433 --> 33:49.500
I think that might be
my next thing.

33:52.700 --> 33:54.433
- Oh!
- Calm down.

33:54.433 --> 33:58.433
all: Cheers.

33:58.433 --> 34:00.400
- Yay.
- [inaudible]

I have a terrible memory.

34:08.600 --> 34:09.734
- Yeah.

34:09.734 --> 34:11.467
- I mean, I was drunk, too.

34:11.467 --> 34:13.133
But you were, like,
really drunk, right?

34:13.133 --> 34:15.000
- Yeah.
We were both pretty f---ed up.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.200
- And then I left you.
Like, we went our separate ways.

34:17.200 --> 34:20.600
- Yeah, yeah. Barcelona.

34:20.600 --> 34:24.300
- Bri and Nico
are definitely oozing

34:24.300 --> 34:27.266
just throw me on this table
and have at me.

34:27.266 --> 34:28.667
There's definitely

34:28.667 --> 34:30.333
some chemistry
between the two of them.

34:30.333 --> 34:32.266
- That was good.
- That was a crazy night.

34:32.266 --> 34:36.734
- Those are the best memories,
really. Barcelona.

34:36.734 --> 34:38.600
- Coming up...

34:38.600 --> 34:41.200
- My God. Who is this guy?
Where did he come from?

34:41.200 --> 34:44.100

you're thinking right now.

34:58.367 --> 35:00.033
- You do want to know.

35:00.033 --> 35:01.600
I have the ability
to make myself...

35:04.734 --> 35:06.734
- Like that?

35:06.734 --> 35:09.500
Like, right now at the table,
you could be cumming?

35:09.500 --> 35:11.633
- Yeah. Mmm.

35:11.633 --> 35:17.066
I don't think that it is humanly
right or sane for an individual

35:17.066 --> 35:20.433
to go as long
as I have without sex.

35:20.433 --> 35:22.367
Like...

35:22.367 --> 35:24.400
mmm.

35:24.400 --> 35:26.266
- I recognize that face.

35:26.266 --> 35:27.667
I don't always see it
at the dinner table.

35:27.667 --> 35:30.133
I normally see it in my bedroom.

35:30.133 --> 35:31.667

- Weird.

35:31.667 --> 35:35.133
I like it, but weird.

in those white pants?

35:50.533 --> 35:55.133
- What?
- I mean, it'd be stupid not to.

35:55.133 --> 35:59.133
- I don't think
you ready for this.

35:59.133 --> 36:00.734
- I need Corona.

36:00.734 --> 36:04.133
There's a dirty animal.
You dirty minx, you.

36:04.133 --> 36:08.767

and you'll see his true colors.

36:08.767 --> 36:10.567
- Bruno!
- Get up.

36:10.567 --> 36:12.033
- Get up! Get up!

36:56.533 --> 36:59.734
I don't know why that was
so hard for me to say.

36:59.734 --> 37:02.333
My job's to smile and laugh
and make people happy.

37:02.333 --> 37:05.200
And, like, that's
your goal, you know?

37:05.200 --> 37:06.600
Bri has a lot of options

potentially date

37:08.600 --> 37:10.533
and hook up with.

37:10.533 --> 37:12.333
But my move for, like,
flirting is just be me.

37:12.333 --> 37:14.200
Be fun, be quirky, be different,

37:14.200 --> 37:17.333

in the Chris Brown project.

Nico doesn't know.

- Ah, okay.
That was a little uncomfortable.

39:32.166 --> 39:33.667
- Do you want a hug,
or are you all good?

39:33.667 --> 39:35.333
- We can totally--

39:35.333 --> 39:37.066
- You're good to give
out a hug to me?

39:37.066 --> 39:38.734
- Night hugs are good.
It's just--oh, heart to heart.

39:38.734 --> 39:40.533
- [inaudible]

39:40.533 --> 39:41.600
- Heart to heart.

39:45.200 --> 39:46.734
- Okay.

39:46.734 --> 39:49.467
I think I should, like,
go to sleep.

39:49.467 --> 39:51.266
- See you in a couple
hours, right?

39:51.266 --> 39:52.467
- Goodnight.

39:52.467 --> 39:54.400
- No regrets.

39:54.400 --> 39:56.166
- Coming up...

39:56.166 --> 39:58.033
- Chris? Chris?
What's your location, Chris?

39:58.033 --> 39:59.734
- This isn't Chris.
This is the captain.

39:59.734 --> 40:13.033
I'm just wondering why I
don't hear his response, Chris.

40:13.100 --> 40:13.266
- So hungry.

40:15.166 --> 40:17.200
- So you guys had fun
last night?

40:17.200 --> 40:19.100
- Yeah, for sure.

40:19.100 --> 40:22.500
- I liked the part where I got
to drink alcohol, so.

40:22.500 --> 40:24.633
- Matt was hilarious.
- Yeah.

40:24.633 --> 40:28.200
- Dude, that guy, man.
He's fantastic.

40:28.200 --> 40:29.633
Probably gonna have
a crush on him

40:29.633 --> 40:32.767
by the end of this
if I don't already.

40:32.767 --> 40:34.633
- You got a hangover
at all, Nico?

40:34.633 --> 40:36.633
- No, man.

40:36.633 --> 40:39.433
I didn't drink enough
to have a hangover.

40:39.433 --> 40:40.734
- Why would you live
your life half-ass?

40:40.734 --> 40:42.433
Why would you halfway party?

40:42.433 --> 40:44.200
If you have a great reason,
celebrate.

40:44.200 --> 40:45.767
Get after it. Send it.

40:45.767 --> 40:50.367
- So my guts are rumbly.
I don't feel good at all.

40:50.367 --> 40:53.066
- All right, let's try and pick
up the pace a little bit.

40:53.066 --> 40:55.066
- How are you feeling today,
Jen? How's everybody feeling?

40:55.066 --> 40:57.000
- I'm good.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.133
- Don't have a headache
or anything? You're so perky.

40:58.133 --> 40:59.667
- No, I know. I feel good.

40:59.667 --> 41:01.667
- Quickly make sure that
the dryers are going,

41:01.667 --> 41:04.400
the washers are going, things
are folded, and come outside.

41:04.400 --> 41:05.400
both: Okay.

41:08.734 --> 41:11.533
- Nico, these drop towels,
do we need to wash these, or--

41:11.533 --> 41:12.567
- Yes.

41:15.667 --> 41:17.400
- Ugh.

41:17.400 --> 41:19.367
Hangover's kicking in.

41:19.367 --> 41:21.734
I didn't start drinking
until I was like 22,

41:21.734 --> 41:24.667
so I guess I'm paying my dues
for all the bad hangovers

41:24.667 --> 41:27.133
I never experienced
as a teenager,

41:27.133 --> 41:29.166
and they are f---ing me.

41:30.400 --> 41:32.000
- I need--
- Change that.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.400
- What?
- Chairs over there.

41:33.400 --> 41:34.533
- All right.
I need to get some water.

41:34.533 --> 41:36.133
I don't feel too good right now.

41:36.133 --> 41:38.533
I'm gonna get back
at it in a moment.

41:38.533 --> 41:40.300
- Chris is being a little baby.

41:40.300 --> 41:42.133
I don't have time
for this sh-- right now.

41:42.133 --> 41:44.667
Drink a Red Bull,
drink a coffee, and let's go.

41:44.667 --> 41:47.567
Rearrange the bridge deck aft,
get this stuff in storage.

41:47.567 --> 41:49.300
- All right, cool.

41:49.300 --> 41:50.700
- And then we're looking good
for tomorrow.

41:50.700 --> 41:52.033
Tomorrow, we'll just
do a wipe-down.

41:52.033 --> 41:53.700
Guests arrive at noon.

41:53.700 --> 41:55.700
So if you want to start on that,
I'll get Chris up here.

41:55.700 --> 41:58.667
- Roger. Sounds good.
- Thanks, Baker.

41:58.667 --> 41:59.700
- Chris, Chris?

42:03.300 --> 42:06.700
- Chris, Chris?
- Chris? Chris?

42:06.700 --> 42:08.567
- Chris,
Chris?

42:08.567 --> 42:10.533
Meeting on the main deck.
Where are you?

42:10.533 --> 42:13.033
- I haven't, like, seen him
downstairs. Want me to go check?

42:13.033 --> 42:14.567
- Chris? Chris?

42:14.567 --> 42:17.166
What's your location, Chris?

42:17.166 --> 42:19.300
- This isn't Chris.
This is the captain.

42:19.300 --> 42:22.600
I'm just wondering why I don't
hear a response from Chris.

42:22.600 --> 42:25.033
- Jesus.
You have got to be kidding me.

42:25.033 --> 42:26.600
I'll find out right now, Cap.

42:28.433 --> 42:31.000
- [snoring]

42:31.000 --> 42:32.300
- Next time, on "Below Deck"...

42:32.300 --> 42:33.700
- Why was his radio down?

42:33.700 --> 42:35.033
- He was in his bunk.
- Sleeping?

42:35.033 --> 42:36.600
- He just went to sleep.

42:36.600 --> 42:38.300
We're gonna pretend like
we're on charter.

42:38.300 --> 42:40.033
I want you guys
to bring you're a game.

42:40.033 --> 42:42.200
I'm trying to channel
my worst charter guests.

42:42.200 --> 42:46.567
What's a girl got to do
for a drink 'round these parts?

42:46.567 --> 42:50.266
- We have Mr. John Healy.
He's a restauranteur.

42:50.266 --> 42:53.333
- Wait. Is that Bruno?

42:53.333 --> 42:56.300
- Uh, yeah.

42:56.300 --> 42:58.467
- Is eggplant really gonna
go good with tequila?

42:58.467 --> 43:00.000
F---.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.567
- Are you guys getting
along right now?

43:01.567 --> 43:05.433
- She sucks at her job,
but she's hilarious.

43:05.433 --> 43:08.333
