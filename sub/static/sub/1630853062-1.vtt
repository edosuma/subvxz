Why haven't I ever connected
this before?

18:24.137 --> 18:26.137
- Probably because it's
mostly a holiday for children.

18:26.172 --> 18:28.639
- No, but I get it.
I really get it.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.842
Hey, everyone, hey, listen up.

18:30.877 --> 18:34.045
I am sorry that I made today
about me

18:34.080 --> 18:37.181
instead of about your pleasure.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.550
- Oh, gross, sir,
but we all forgive you.

18:39.586 --> 18:42.753
- Thanks, Tommy,
yeah, not Jayden.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.590
I destroyed his Christmas song.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.925
No amount of money
is gonna bring that back.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.894
- Wait, can you call
Taryn DiGiacomo?

18:49.929 --> 18:51.295
I mean, maybe he can--

18:51.331 --> 18:54.298
- Use his mental powers
to guess the lost lyrics?

18:54.334 --> 18:56.033
Yes, I'm still here

18:56.069 --> 18:57.969
because my Lyft canceled
because traffic's a mess.

18:58.004 --> 19:00.505
- Flag on the play.
No one goes home.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.640
- Damn it, man.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.208
- Hey, can you do that?

19:04.244 --> 19:06.344
Can you mentalize
Jayden's song back?

19:06.379 --> 19:10.481
- Again, I'm not a psychic.
I just read body language.

19:10.517 --> 19:12.316
Okay, some of what I do
involves hiding microphones

19:12.352 --> 19:13.818
in bathrooms,
but I did not do that here

19:13.853 --> 19:15.219
because it was
too short notice.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.420
- How are you married
and I'm not?

19:16.456 --> 19:19.957
- What I do do is thin-slice
people by asking questions.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.492
For example,
if the guy was here,

19:21.528 --> 19:24.095
I would ask, "Jayden,
what's your favorite color?"

19:24.130 --> 19:25.396
all: Yellow.
- 'Cause minions.

19:25.431 --> 19:28.866
- Jayden, what's a three-digit
number that's important to you?

19:28.902 --> 19:30.368
All: Seven, eight, nine.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.370
- It's why six is
afraid of seven.

19:32.405 --> 19:36.507
Boy, we know that kid
really well, don't we?

19:36.543 --> 19:38.910
- You know what?
Maybe I can do this.

19:38.945 --> 19:41.145
Maybe Taryn DiGiacomo
can finally prove

19:41.181 --> 19:43.781
to his father
that mentalism is a valued--

19:43.816 --> 19:45.416
- Taryn, you're not
the main character.

19:45.451 --> 19:47.585
Orly, get some paper.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.620
