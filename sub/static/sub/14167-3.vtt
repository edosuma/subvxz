WEBVTT

00:07.689 --> 00:11.160
I loved college.

00:11.194 --> 00:14.408
I went for a year
in Northridge.

00:15.390 --> 00:19.462
I was gonna major
in graphic art,

00:19.496 --> 00:20.996
but then I found out

00:21.030 --> 00:25.000
that you only end up designing
pharmaceutical pamphlets,

00:25.034 --> 00:29.338
so then I switched
to art history.

00:29.372 --> 00:31.740
I'm actually
a pretty good artist.

00:33.211 --> 00:35.944
I mean, not good enough
to really, like, do it,

00:35.979 --> 00:39.347
but I still sketch.

00:40.947 --> 00:46.387
Like, even ugly things
can be pretty in ways.

00:51.485 --> 00:54.529
Then I had a kid,
so I dropped out.

01:00.469 --> 01:02.313
What's the password?!

01:02.326 --> 01:04.893
Open the door, asshole.
Come on.

01:07.409 --> 01:09.010
What's up, fellas?

01:09.950 --> 01:12.346
- Not bad.
- Hey.

01:12.380 --> 01:14.214
Wow, you guys
are really cute.

01:14.249 --> 01:16.050
Dude, how old is she?

01:16.084 --> 01:18.461
This is who he had.
It'll be fine.

01:18.486 --> 01:19.920
She's not even dressed up
or anything.

01:19.970 --> 01:21.479
I got an outfit.

01:22.691 --> 01:23.958
Are you Skinner?

01:24.825 --> 01:27.103
Yeah, but...

01:27.619 --> 01:30.330
We got you for all of us.

01:31.368 --> 01:32.999
Okay.

01:34.235 --> 01:36.570
Let me just get changed,
and we'll have some fun.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074

03:43.126 --> 03:44.794
Aah!

03:44.828 --> 03:46.296
Oh! Fuck!

03:46.330 --> 03:48.631
Ah, shit.

04:14.156 --> 04:17.225
Point is, rats can be fucking anywhere.

04:19.562 --> 04:22.263
Downtown, Boyle Heights,
fucking Palisades...

04:22.298 --> 04:23.264
they don't give a shit.

04:23.299 --> 04:25.734
And that's great for me.

04:25.768 --> 04:28.636
'Cause I'm building
a goddamn empire on rats.

04:28.670 --> 04:29.904
See what I'm saying?

04:29.939 --> 04:32.040
You got to find a spot
and fit in.

04:32.074 --> 04:33.842
Do the shit nobody wants to do.

04:33.876 --> 04:36.177
You see, I saw a need
and I filled it.

04:36.212 --> 04:40.315
That's being an entrepreneur,
being a boss.

04:42.718 --> 04:44.051
Goddamn, boy.
You hearing me?

04:44.085 --> 04:46.086
I'm trying to give you
a motherfucking road map.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.355
Oh, you're an inspiration, Carl.

04:47.389 --> 04:48.522
You're giving me
goose bumps.

04:52.394 --> 04:54.027
Ah.

04:54.062 --> 04:55.095
Okay.

04:55.129 --> 04:57.665
You just keep on staring
at that ass

04:57.699 --> 04:59.632
that you ain't
never gonna get.

04:59.667 --> 05:02.435
Shit, boy, you may be white,
but you still a felon.

05:06.040 --> 05:08.208
Hey, Shelby.

05:08.243 --> 05:09.910
Morning.

05:09.944 --> 05:12.112
Alvey's in his office.
He screwed up his knee.

05:12.146 --> 05:13.280
What'd he do?

05:13.314 --> 05:15.384
I think he was doing dead lifts
or something.

05:18.619 --> 05:21.187
Dead lifts?
At your age?

05:22.156 --> 05:24.123
I'm fine.
I just tweaked it.

05:24.157 --> 05:27.694
Have you thought about,
I don't know, water aerobics?

05:27.728 --> 05:29.061
Maybe a brisk walk.

05:29.096 --> 05:31.481
So funny.

05:31.556 --> 05:32.864
Give me it.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.901
By the way, there was blood

05:34.935 --> 05:36.635
all over my canvas
this morning.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.237
Yeah, Josephina
called in sick today.

05:38.272 --> 05:40.406
Well, then Josephina's
got to find somebody
to cover for her.

05:40.440 --> 05:41.607
Or get Taylor or one
of these other jerk-offs

05:41.641 --> 05:42.741
who owes fees to do it.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.010
You got to get somebody
to do this.

05:44.044 --> 05:46.145
You can't leave me
with blood on this canvas.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.414
I'll get into it.

05:50.005 --> 05:52.117
Is Ryan
working out today?

05:52.151 --> 05:53.886
No, he texted me.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.621
He's stuck
at some bullshit job.

05:55.655 --> 05:57.790
I got to figure out
how to handle him, too.

05:57.824 --> 06:00.251
I got to...
I got to protect him.

06:01.044 --> 06:02.214
Okay, well,
it's your thing.

06:02.289 --> 06:03.685
What do you want to do?

06:06.365 --> 06:08.599
I think I want to close down
the gym while he's training.

06:08.634 --> 06:10.201
- No, Alvey.
- A couple of hours.

06:10.236 --> 06:11.669
- You're killing me.
- A couple of hours.

06:11.703 --> 06:13.004
Yeah, that's
a couple of hours

06:13.039 --> 06:14.139
that we're not making money.

06:14.173 --> 06:16.241
I know, babe,
but I got to manage this.

06:16.275 --> 06:18.609
Okay? He hasn't been
in a cage in five years.

06:18.644 --> 06:20.111
He's hesitant.

06:20.146 --> 06:21.946
He's got a lot of fucking eyes
on him. You know?

06:21.980 --> 06:23.113
He's scared.

06:23.148 --> 06:25.950
I need him to open up,
shake off the ring rust.

06:25.984 --> 06:28.033
Not to mention the P.R.
of it all.

06:28.083 --> 06:29.520
I mean, I can't have
anybody, you know,

06:29.555 --> 06:31.121
saying Ryan Wheeler's
washed up,

06:31.156 --> 06:32.957
he's no good, he sucks,
he's finished.

06:38.663 --> 06:42.232
I, uh, got to take this.

06:42.267 --> 06:43.900
- All right, two hours.
- Bye.

06:43.935 --> 06:47.371
- No more.
- Yep.

06:47.405 --> 06:48.839
Thank you.

06:48.873 --> 06:51.741
- Two hours, I'm serious.
- Nice jeans.

06:58.614 --> 06:59.748
I am bushed.

06:59.782 --> 07:03.103
There was a tranny in there
who would not shut up.

07:03.153 --> 07:04.436
Oh.

07:05.287 --> 07:07.588
I mean, what a chatterbox.

07:07.623 --> 07:11.259
Good stories, but Jesus.

07:13.762 --> 07:15.929
Are you a fucking maniac?

07:15.964 --> 07:17.097
Attacking a cop?

07:17.132 --> 07:19.433
I mean, really, you're gonna
fight a detective?

07:19.468 --> 07:20.501
What is wrong with you?

07:20.535 --> 07:22.202
I didn't attack
or fight anybody, okay?

07:22.237 --> 07:23.871
You've got to knock
this shit off, Jay.

07:23.905 --> 07:25.973
Don't make me feel bad,
Lisa. Come on.

07:26.007 --> 07:27.308
All right?

07:27.342 --> 07:29.342
I haven't slept for
a fucking night, I'm tired,

07:29.377 --> 07:30.744
I got to take
a colossal shit.

07:30.779 --> 07:31.779
I'm not in the mood.

07:31.813 --> 07:34.014
I'm not making you feel
any way, Jay.

07:34.048 --> 07:35.849
You do this shit
to yourself.

07:35.884 --> 07:38.786
You've seen the scar
on my brother's head.

07:42.824 --> 07:46.593
I'm just asking you to calm
the fuck down a little bit.

07:48.211 --> 07:49.796
You're right.

07:49.830 --> 07:50.963
You're right.
You're right.

07:50.998 --> 07:52.632
Don't fucking placate me,
motherfucker.

07:52.667 --> 07:54.033
No, I'm... I'm...
Lisa, I'm not.

07:54.067 --> 07:56.303
I'm saying, seriously,
you're fucking right.

07:56.337 --> 07:59.005
Sometimes I can't
help myself, Lisa.

07:59.039 --> 08:01.440
I'm an emotional man.

08:01.474 --> 08:03.375
- Did you tell my dad about this?
- Fuck no.

08:03.410 --> 08:05.812
I actually like
having you around the gym.

08:05.846 --> 08:06.979
Thanks for picking me up.

08:07.014 --> 08:09.849
- Where to?
- Home. I got to shower.

08:09.883 --> 08:12.018
Also, I'm working the door
at Tanya's this week,

08:12.052 --> 08:13.853
so you can come by
for some free drinks.

08:13.887 --> 08:15.421
I might just take you up
on that.

08:15.455 --> 08:16.892
- Yeah.
- Seat belt.

08:18.891 --> 08:20.793
Fucking asshole.

08:22.971 --> 08:24.739
So, other than the knee,

08:24.773 --> 08:26.774
we're looking at a separated shoulder,

08:26.808 --> 08:29.817
a cracked clavicle,
and neck and back strain, right?

08:29.855 --> 08:30.912
That's it.

08:32.080 --> 08:34.147
How much pain are you in?

08:34.182 --> 08:36.116
Pick a face.

08:36.150 --> 08:38.518
Really?

08:38.552 --> 08:41.221
Um...
The light green one.

08:41.256 --> 08:42.554
Number two.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.358
Mild is a goal.
It's not a starting point.

08:44.392 --> 08:45.792
You should be
at least a purple.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.594
No, he looks like
he's about to die.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.062
I... I don't feel
that bad.

08:49.097 --> 08:52.899
Maybe you've just gotten used
to a certain level of pain.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.268
Maybe.

08:55.303 --> 08:57.570
You can feel
so much better than this.

08:57.604 --> 08:59.790
You just have to learn
to listen to your body.

08:59.815 --> 09:02.493
How long until
I can start fighting?

09:02.528 --> 09:04.195
Look at you,
already missing the point.

09:04.229 --> 09:06.364
No, I...

09:06.398 --> 09:09.200
I'm ju... you know, t-there's
just, like, a lot of beads

09:09.234 --> 09:11.135
and Buddhas
and shit in here,

09:11.170 --> 09:13.304
and I-I'm not looking
to meditate.

09:13.338 --> 09:15.239
What's wrong
with meditation?

09:15.274 --> 09:17.941
Nothing. It's great.

09:17.976 --> 09:19.544
I'm not judging.

09:19.578 --> 09:23.013
Yeah, you are.
You'll see.

09:23.048 --> 09:24.415
Okay, so,
before we get started,

09:24.449 --> 09:26.583
are there any other injuries
that I should know about?

09:26.617 --> 09:29.787
Yeah, um, three cracked ribs
on this side,

09:29.821 --> 09:32.656
two on my right,
uh, cracked orbital,

09:32.691 --> 09:35.559
um, broken collarbone,
a couple concussions,

09:35.593 --> 09:37.260
ripped my left a.C.L.

09:37.295 --> 09:39.429
Uh, it's fine now, though.
It's been a while.

09:39.463 --> 09:41.531
And, uh, I keep
spraining my ankle,

09:41.566 --> 09:43.600
but it's just
'cause of how I run.

09:44.658 --> 09:46.336
Oh, man. You're fucked.

09:48.206 --> 09:49.439
Then what?
Where do they go?

09:49.473 --> 09:50.840
Like, to a mass grave?

09:53.043 --> 09:54.444
Well,
I think they burn 'em.

09:54.478 --> 09:56.313
There's, like, a way
they got to do it.

09:56.347 --> 09:57.681
Do you do that? You burn rats?

09:57.715 --> 09:59.348
No, I don't do it.

09:59.382 --> 10:00.683
What a gig.

10:00.718 --> 10:01.718
Yeah,
it's fucking miserable.

10:01.752 --> 10:04.486
But, you know,
I got to have a job.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.222
So I have no choice.

10:06.256 --> 10:07.790
You got a job, dude.
You're a fighter.

10:07.825 --> 10:08.791
This isn't your job.

10:08.826 --> 10:10.426
My parole officer put me
in this,

10:10.460 --> 10:11.861
and I'm there all day,
so...

10:11.895 --> 10:13.996
What's your
parole officer's name?

10:14.031 --> 10:15.997
- Dantzler.
- Dantzler.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.466
All right, I'm gonna talk
to Dantzler.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.000
I'll get you squared away.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.168
Okay.

10:20.203 --> 10:21.337
In the meantime,
do you need anything else?

10:21.371 --> 10:22.804
You okay in here?

10:22.839 --> 10:24.640
- Yeah, I'm good. Thanks.
- Okay.

10:24.674 --> 10:27.075
This is fucking temporary.

10:27.110 --> 10:28.277
You know that, right?

10:28.311 --> 10:30.112
We'll get you back
in the cage.

10:30.146 --> 10:31.447
This is a fucking blip.

10:33.216 --> 10:37.585
Eyes up. Eyes up.

10:37.620 --> 10:39.420
Always.

10:39.455 --> 10:40.421
Good.

10:45.895 --> 10:46.995
Now king me.

11:17.692 --> 11:19.193
Hey, baby.

11:53.027 --> 11:54.993
Hey, man, I'm...

11:55.028 --> 11:56.362
I'm looking for someone?

11:56.396 --> 11:59.031
I got a black chick.

11:59.065 --> 12:00.399
No.

12:00.434 --> 12:03.202
You fucking racist?

12:03.236 --> 12:05.604
Uh, no.

12:05.639 --> 12:07.105
I'm looking
for someone specific.

12:07.140 --> 12:09.174
Um, her name's Christina.

12:09.209 --> 12:13.846
She's a little older,
dark hair, pretty.

12:13.880 --> 12:15.513
Yeah, she's good.

12:15.548 --> 12:17.649
But she's expensive.

12:20.053 --> 12:21.786
Worth it, though.

12:21.821 --> 12:23.088
She'll make you blow a load

12:23.122 --> 12:24.857
through the fucking
ceiling, man.

12:30.262 --> 12:32.664
How much?

12:32.698 --> 12:34.265
$300.

12:41.841 --> 12:45.476
She's upstairs,
second floor.

12:45.510 --> 12:46.710
Room 8.

12:49.614 --> 12:52.083
What's your name?

12:52.117 --> 12:53.484
Terry.

12:53.518 --> 12:56.287
Terry.
I'll remember that.

12:56.321 --> 12:58.689
Thanks, Terry.

13:14.806 --> 13:17.673
No! Jay, no! Stop.

13:17.708 --> 13:18.975
No, Jay,
what are you doing?!

13:19.010 --> 13:20.043
- Shh! It's okay.
- Terry has a gun!

13:20.077 --> 13:22.445
I know, ma.
I paid him for the hour.

13:22.479 --> 13:24.647
I paid Terry, okay,
for an hour.

13:24.681 --> 13:26.716
All right?

13:26.750 --> 13:30.486
Ma? Mom?

14:11.699 --> 14:12.718
Mom.

14:15.665 --> 14:18.341
- Hey.
- What are you...

14:20.014 --> 14:21.736
how am I supposed to work
after this?

14:21.771 --> 14:25.273
Oh, I'm crying.
Nobody wants a crying girl.

14:25.307 --> 14:26.640
They're gonna bitch
at Terry,

14:26.675 --> 14:28.176
and then he's gonna
bitch me out...

14:28.210 --> 14:29.210
D-don't tell me that.

14:31.013 --> 14:33.881
What do you think I'm doing
down here in this shit hole?

14:33.915 --> 14:35.683
Whoa, what do you think
I'm doing down here?

14:35.717 --> 14:36.784
I'm trying to talk
to you, mom.

14:36.818 --> 14:38.319
You don't want
to talk to me.

14:38.354 --> 14:40.788
You want to give me a little
money and give me a hot meal

14:40.822 --> 14:43.423
because mom's a whore,
and it's so fucking sad.

14:43.458 --> 14:45.225
Hey! S-stop, mom.
Stop. Okay?

14:45.259 --> 14:48.295
Hear me.

14:48.329 --> 14:52.900
I'm your son,
and I love you.

14:52.934 --> 14:56.203
I don't care what
you're doing right now

14:56.237 --> 14:57.837
or what you've done.

14:57.872 --> 15:01.241
I love you.

15:09.650 --> 15:11.318
I got this phone for you.

15:12.420 --> 15:15.522
I'm programmed in it,
under number one.

15:15.556 --> 15:19.826
So you call me
any time you want.

15:21.733 --> 15:24.463
Okay? My phone number
is programmed.

15:24.498 --> 15:27.528
You just press one
and call.

15:29.113 --> 15:30.546
I got you.

15:34.074 --> 15:36.342
Jay...

15:36.376 --> 15:37.676
Your jacket.

15:37.710 --> 15:40.612
No, you can have it.

15:50.492 --> 15:52.193
Don't stare at the bear.

15:52.227 --> 15:53.660
Sorry, bro.

15:57.031 --> 15:58.364
Do you bring him
everywhere?

15:58.399 --> 16:01.601
He's a gift
from my mother.

16:01.635 --> 16:03.369
The only time
I didn't have him

16:03.404 --> 16:04.671
was when I was locked up.

16:05.983 --> 16:08.041
Your mother come
to visit you much here?

16:08.076 --> 16:10.142
No, she's dead.

16:10.177 --> 16:12.645
Oh, shit, man.
I'm sorry.

16:14.548 --> 16:16.683
When did she pass?

16:16.717 --> 16:19.452
A couple weeks after
she gave me the bear.

16:19.486 --> 16:20.786
I was almost 10.

16:20.821 --> 16:23.523
She was the best.

16:23.557 --> 16:26.425
She was the smartest person
I've ever met.

16:26.459 --> 16:30.662
And she was only 32,
so she was still very pretty.

16:30.697 --> 16:32.865
I don't mean pretty
because she's my mom,

16:32.899 --> 16:34.633
but pretty
like if you saw her,

16:34.667 --> 16:35.935
you'd think,
"that's a pretty lady."

16:35.969 --> 16:37.036
Yeah.

16:37.070 --> 16:38.704
Pretty young, man.
Was she ill?

16:38.739 --> 16:39.872
No, she was fine.

16:41.241 --> 16:43.508
My dad killed her with a hammer
when she was asleep,

16:43.543 --> 16:45.143
then shot himself
in the backyard.

16:53.286 --> 16:55.019
I'm gonna go to the kitchen
and get some yogurt.

16:55.054 --> 16:57.422
If I find some,
do you want some?

16:57.457 --> 17:00.291
Uh, no.
I'm great, thanks.

17:14.006 --> 17:16.006
Hey.
Mark Dantzler.

17:16.040 --> 17:17.608
- How you doing?
- How you doing?

17:17.643 --> 17:18.608
Alvey Kulina.

17:18.644 --> 17:20.511
How you doing?

17:20.545 --> 17:22.579
They restocked
the nutter butters today,

17:22.614 --> 17:24.815
and I... I got to sweep
in there like a hawk

17:24.848 --> 17:26.550
and clean
the whole machine out.

17:26.585 --> 17:28.050
I think
you got all of them.

17:28.086 --> 17:29.853
Yeah, it's greedy as shit,
isn't it?

17:29.888 --> 17:31.622
Of course
you got that vascular look.

17:31.657 --> 17:33.456
You probably
don't touch these things.

17:33.491 --> 17:34.457
Nah, not really.

17:34.492 --> 17:36.059
They're good, though.
I like 'em.

17:36.094 --> 17:37.861
Yeah, they're good.

17:37.896 --> 17:41.531
So, uh...
You're here for...

17:41.565 --> 17:44.034
- Ryan Wheeler.
- Yeah.

17:44.068 --> 17:46.815
- How can I help you?
- Well, he's an old friend.

17:46.840 --> 17:49.207
Uh, I mean, he's more
like family, actually.

17:49.242 --> 17:51.009
And we're just really proud
of the progress

17:51.043 --> 17:52.410
that the kid's been making.

17:52.445 --> 17:56.414
Well, his piss is clean,
and he's got a good attitude.

17:56.449 --> 17:57.915
Yeah, so I'm thinking

17:57.950 --> 18:00.385
it's time for him
to take the next step.

18:00.419 --> 18:03.622
- To what?
- I want to give him a job.

18:03.656 --> 18:05.489
Well,
he's already got a job.

18:05.524 --> 18:08.259
He's killing rats.

18:08.293 --> 18:10.594
I think I can do
something better for him.

18:11.379 --> 18:13.564
What kind of business
you in?

18:13.598 --> 18:15.399
I own a gym, MMA.

18:15.433 --> 18:18.836
I train professionals
like Ryan.

18:19.972 --> 18:21.438
Doesn't sound like
the best environment

18:21.473 --> 18:22.506
for a violent offender.

18:22.541 --> 18:23.674
Well, it's, uh...

18:23.708 --> 18:24.908
It's a little different
than you're thinking.

18:24.942 --> 18:27.944
He's an athlete in the...
in the prime of his career.

18:27.979 --> 18:29.746
You know, why you want
to take that from him?

18:29.781 --> 18:30.747
Well...

18:30.782 --> 18:32.216
I'll take him,
just, you know...

18:32.250 --> 18:33.684
I-I-I-I'll pay him to be a coach

18:33.718 --> 18:35.219
so he meets
his employment obligations,

18:35.253 --> 18:36.353
but more importantly,

18:36.388 --> 18:37.754
I'm gonna give him structure
and discipline.

18:37.789 --> 18:40.590
And the way we run our gym,
it's... it's a family.

18:40.624 --> 18:42.592
This kid will be surrounded
by love.

18:42.626 --> 18:44.194
- I get it.
- Yeah.

18:44.228 --> 18:45.595
You're selling.
You're selling.

18:46.798 --> 18:48.198
I see the veins
popping in your neck.

18:48.232 --> 18:49.232
Yeah.

18:49.266 --> 18:51.101
Appreciate the,
uh...The passion.

18:51.135 --> 18:52.102
Uh-huh.

18:52.136 --> 18:53.536
But, um...

18:55.138 --> 18:57.307
Wasn't he...

18:57.341 --> 19:00.076
In a gym,
surrounded by a family,

19:00.110 --> 19:02.945
when, uh, he brutally assaulted
his father?

19:02.979 --> 19:04.314
That's a good question.

19:04.348 --> 19:05.815
I mean, but, you know,
that was a long time ago.

19:05.849 --> 19:06.816
This... he was lost.

19:06.850 --> 19:08.451
This... this kid was lost
back then.

19:08.485 --> 19:09.485
And he wasn't with me.

19:15.589 --> 19:17.559
I like him at Rat Reapers.

19:17.594 --> 19:19.061
He's gonna stay there.

19:19.096 --> 19:21.496
It humbles him.

19:21.531 --> 19:24.681
Some of these guys,
you got to cut their balls off.

19:27.385 --> 19:29.170
Huh.

19:29.205 --> 19:32.574
In the sweeping wilderness
of yellowstone,

19:32.609 --> 19:34.809
the grizzly once ruled alone.

20:06.642 --> 20:09.843
Whoa!

20:20.021 --> 20:22.022
Unmatched in size and strength,

20:22.056 --> 20:24.691
no creature could challenge
the mighty bears.

20:27.762 --> 20:29.396
It's hard to find people
for this job, man.

20:29.430 --> 20:30.397
Can't do it.

20:30.431 --> 20:32.499
It's backbreaking work,
you know?

20:32.533 --> 20:34.467
I mean, probably find
some Mexicans to do it,

20:34.502 --> 20:36.202
but then you got
documentation issues.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.771
So, what, Dantzler
just funnels you ex-cons?

20:37.805 --> 20:40.573
It ain't like
they got choices.

20:40.608 --> 20:42.241
What's in it
for Dantzler?

20:43.072 --> 20:45.378
You know, me and Dantzler

20:45.413 --> 20:48.281
really got nothing to do
with me and you.

20:48.316 --> 20:50.382
So, why don't you tell me
what you need,

20:50.417 --> 20:52.251
and maybe we can work
something out.

20:52.286 --> 20:54.220
Dantzler don't need
to know.

20:54.254 --> 20:56.588
Yeah, all right.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.757
What I need is for you
to pick up Ryan every morning

20:58.792 --> 21:01.160
like he's doing his shift,
you bring him to my gym, right?

21:01.195 --> 21:02.195
End of the day,

21:02.229 --> 21:04.297
you pick him up,
take him home.

21:04.331 --> 21:06.265
It's a carpool.
It's fucking nothing.

21:06.300 --> 21:09.169
Well, it's not nothing.
I'll be down a guy.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.406
How much you want?

21:18.851 --> 21:20.912
- 5 grand.
- Oh, come on, playboy.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.581
You got to give me
a better number than that.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.182
Well, I mean,
there ain't a better number.

21:24.217 --> 21:26.051
It's $5k.

21:26.085 --> 21:27.919
Jesus.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.229
It's $5k,
or we're done.

21:32.624 --> 21:34.659
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:34.693 --> 21:35.760
How we doing?

21:35.794 --> 21:37.528
We're are fucking flush.

21:37.563 --> 21:38.930
For real?

21:38.965 --> 21:40.832
Yeah.
You know what?

21:40.866 --> 21:42.834
You can just take
this whole pile

21:42.868 --> 21:45.903
and go get us a boat
and some jet skis.

21:45.937 --> 21:47.071
Wise ass.

21:49.708 --> 21:52.877
I'm thinking maybe we need
a new canvas for the cage.

21:52.911 --> 21:55.413
We don't need a new canvas
for the cage.

21:57.019 --> 21:59.850
I'm thinking we need
a new canvas for the cage.

21:59.885 --> 22:02.186
We can't afford a new canvas
for the cage.

22:21.773 --> 22:23.907
Honey, no.

22:23.941 --> 22:26.074
Wanda, I need the money.

22:27.835 --> 22:29.055
How much do you need?

22:29.093 --> 22:30.113
What do you think
you can get?

22:30.147 --> 22:31.647
I can do $4,000.

22:34.193 --> 22:36.119
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

22:36.153 --> 22:38.421
You're big in Japan.

22:38.455 --> 22:39.789
I'm fucking tiny here.

22:39.823 --> 22:41.857
Well, this was
a legendary tournament.

22:41.892 --> 22:44.827
I know a Japanese collector,
he's gonna buy it sight unseen.

22:44.861 --> 22:45.895
Good.

22:45.929 --> 22:48.631
Let me get your cash.
Thank you.

22:51.301 --> 22:52.902
Big in Japan.

23:00.116 --> 23:02.037
Jesus, get dressed,
Chrissy.

23:11.993 --> 23:14.262
Where we going tonight?

23:14.296 --> 23:16.997
The Marriott hotel,
West Covina.

23:17.032 --> 23:20.300
That rodeo...
all the guys is down there.

23:23.204 --> 23:25.072
- Should be a good night.
- Mnh.

23:25.106 --> 23:27.708
Bring some extra rubbers.
Cowboys love to fuck.

23:30.045 --> 23:31.611
All right.

23:31.646 --> 23:33.147
I'll be waiting
in the car.

23:33.181 --> 23:34.514
Okay.

23:55.002 --> 23:57.103
What happened
to your leg?

23:57.137 --> 24:00.006
I hurt it training.

24:01.842 --> 24:04.643
And don't say
anything smart.

24:04.678 --> 24:07.113
How about you?
How's the rehab going?

24:07.147 --> 24:09.082
It's good.

24:09.116 --> 24:12.150
Yeah?
You like your P.T.?

24:12.185 --> 24:13.819
Yeah,
she seems all right.

24:13.853 --> 24:16.222
Mnh.

24:16.256 --> 24:17.489
She?

24:17.524 --> 24:20.492
What's...
what's her name?

24:20.527 --> 24:21.627
Tatiana.

24:21.661 --> 24:24.963
Come on.
That's her real name?

24:25.693 --> 24:27.999
Is Tatiana a hooker?

24:30.103 --> 24:32.904
How'd you get hooker
from that na... I...

24:32.939 --> 24:34.906
You can get a hooker
from anything, son.

24:34.941 --> 24:37.375
Doesn't matter, as long
as she's taking care of you.

24:37.409 --> 24:40.612
I need you healthy and
training as soon as possible.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.947
Yeah, I know.

24:44.307 --> 24:45.182
How's the camera?

24:45.217 --> 24:46.718
The camera's
a piece of shit.

24:46.752 --> 24:48.553
I can get a better image
on my phone.

24:48.587 --> 24:50.855
- We should just use that.
- We're not using your phone,

24:50.889 --> 24:52.290
because your phone is a pubic
hair away from the Internet,

24:52.324 --> 24:53.625
and I can't have
that video leaking.

24:53.659 --> 24:55.793
Use the camera.

24:55.827 --> 24:58.463
Camera it is.

25:02.868 --> 25:04.468
Wheeler.
Get out.

25:08.306 --> 25:09.506
Rat reapers.

25:12.343 --> 25:13.811
What are we doing?

25:13.845 --> 25:15.146
I got a locker
set up for you.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.179
- Go get changed.
- No, no, no.

25:16.213 --> 25:17.314
Dantzler's gonna
write me up, man.

25:17.348 --> 25:18.448
No, no, no, no.

25:18.483 --> 25:19.916
Dantzler is taken care of,
my friend.

25:19.950 --> 25:21.050
Now go get changed,

25:21.085 --> 25:23.320
and let's get ready
to crank some nuts.

25:26.724 --> 25:27.957
Where you going?

25:27.992 --> 25:29.058
You said you wanted
the gym closed.

25:29.093 --> 25:30.427
Not you.

25:30.461 --> 25:31.928
No, Alvey.
I'm not mad.

25:31.962 --> 25:34.430
I just... I don't need
to be around for this.

25:34.464 --> 25:35.832
Am I gonna see you later?

25:35.866 --> 25:38.168
- Eventually.
- I'm gonna see you later.

26:36.726 --> 26:37.692
Wake up.

26:42.164 --> 26:43.764
Come on, move your head.

26:43.798 --> 26:46.033
Come on, move your head.
Move your head.

26:46.068 --> 26:48.469
Watch my foot. Yep.

26:48.503 --> 26:50.238
Come on.
Come... come on.

26:50.272 --> 26:51.272
It's not there.

26:52.374 --> 26:54.842
Ryan, make me post down.

26:54.876 --> 26:56.744
Where's your head?
Where's your head?

26:56.778 --> 26:57.944
Where's your fucking...

27:01.683 --> 27:02.983
heads up!

27:15.529 --> 27:16.696
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

27:16.730 --> 27:18.464
Breathe. Relax.

27:18.499 --> 27:20.901
Relax. Relax.
What's there?

27:20.935 --> 27:22.668
Man.

27:22.703 --> 27:25.338
What's there?

27:26.374 --> 27:27.540
Good. Good. Good. Good.

27:27.574 --> 27:29.008
Good. Good.

27:29.042 --> 27:30.009
Fuck!

27:30.043 --> 27:31.778
Shut it off.

27:31.812 --> 27:33.579
I'm fucking
exhausted, man!

27:33.614 --> 27:36.015
I got no flexibility,
I got no flow at all, man.

27:36.049 --> 27:37.383
You got fucking
training wheels on me,

27:37.418 --> 27:39.151
- and I still can't even keep up.
- Oh, come on, man.

27:39.185 --> 27:40.753
You've been away from the game
for four years.

27:40.788 --> 27:41.754
Bullshit!
Bullshit, Alvey.

27:41.789 --> 27:43.055
You're fucking worried,
too.

27:43.089 --> 27:44.456
You think I don't notice
why the gym is empty?

27:45.491 --> 27:46.825
You don't even want Nate
to film me,

27:46.859 --> 27:47.826
I fucking suck so much.

27:47.860 --> 27:50.296
- Trust the process.
- It's a waste of time.

27:50.330 --> 27:52.697
- Trust the process.
- It's a waste of time!

27:57.337 --> 28:00.172
Dude, I don't fucking
have it anymore, man.

28:00.206 --> 28:02.407
This is all you got.

28:04.710 --> 28:06.511
This is all you got.

28:06.546 --> 28:09.213
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

28:09.248 --> 28:12.050
We got a long way to go.
Come on! Come on!

28:13.152 --> 28:14.586
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Come on.
- Fuck!

28:23.295 --> 28:24.395
Fuck.

28:34.439 --> 28:36.073
You know what?
You should make a drink

28:36.107 --> 28:39.176
that's an ice cube
of nitrous oxide

28:39.210 --> 28:42.212
- underneath a fried egg.
- Mmhmm.

28:42.246 --> 28:43.747
You just gently
lay the egg ever so...

28:43.782 --> 28:44.715
hey.

28:48.086 --> 28:50.053
Well, now it's happy hour.

28:50.088 --> 28:52.922
Look at that!
Why are you here so early?

28:52.957 --> 28:54.024
Oh, we closed the gym

28:54.058 --> 28:56.026
so that your dad could train
with Ryan.

28:56.060 --> 28:57.827
And I thought I'd throw
some booze down my throat.

28:57.862 --> 28:59.196
Get off me, you weirdo.

28:59.230 --> 29:00.563
Boy, look at you.
You got that look, Lisa.

29:00.598 --> 29:01.931
What look?

29:01.966 --> 29:04.267
- You know that look.
- I don't have a look.

29:04.302 --> 29:07.203
The "fun time,
party time" Lisa.

29:07.237 --> 29:08.738
Sit down!

29:08.772 --> 29:10.072
- We're drinking!
- Yes, we are.

29:10.107 --> 29:11.107
Barwoman,

29:11.141 --> 29:12.141
get this lady a drink,
please.

29:12.175 --> 29:14.477
Drinks are on me.

29:14.512 --> 29:15.545
Put 'em on the tab.

29:16.614 --> 29:17.647
Hear, hear.

29:20.518 --> 29:22.184
Mm.

29:22.219 --> 29:23.785
How about you make up
one of those drinks

29:23.820 --> 29:25.121
I was telling you about?

29:25.155 --> 29:27.523
How about you stand
by the fucking door?
You're working.

29:27.557 --> 29:28.957
Yeah,
that's where I'm going.

29:28.992 --> 29:30.893
Pfft! I'm doing it.
I'm out of here. Look.

29:30.927 --> 29:32.895
- You keep drinking.
- I'll do that.

29:32.929 --> 29:34.463
- And I'll be back...
- M'kay.

29:34.498 --> 29:36.065
At my leisure,
mama bear.

29:36.099 --> 29:37.466
Thank you, mama.

29:37.501 --> 29:38.634
Of course, sweetie.

29:47.944 --> 29:51.246
Red bull. Vodka.
Ice. Tab.

29:54.083 --> 29:56.184
Smile.

29:56.218 --> 29:57.818
Excuse me?

29:57.853 --> 30:00.221
You should smile.

30:01.357 --> 30:04.892
Smile. Yeah,
you're right.

30:04.927 --> 30:06.361
I had a shit day today.

30:06.395 --> 30:07.429
Mm-hmm.

30:07.463 --> 30:08.530
And like an idiot,

30:08.564 --> 30:10.631
I come to the bar
and start drinking.

30:10.666 --> 30:14.602
But, really, all
I should've done was smile.

30:14.636 --> 30:16.270
Hmm.

30:17.973 --> 30:20.608
Oh, my God, you're right.

30:20.642 --> 30:21.609
Right?

30:21.643 --> 30:24.045
Smiling is the best.

30:24.079 --> 30:26.380
You know,
you should write a book

30:26.414 --> 30:30.333
and call it "smiling: A guide
to making bitches happy."

30:31.519 --> 30:33.500
Well,
you're definitely a bitch.

30:35.490 --> 30:36.856
Can I give you
some advice?

30:36.891 --> 30:39.493
You are a pretty girl.

30:39.527 --> 30:41.462
You should talk less.

30:41.496 --> 30:44.698
Ow! Shit!
Son of a bitch!

30:47.001 --> 30:49.502
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

30:49.536 --> 30:51.705
Oh, whoa.
Get the fuck out, boy.

30:52.840 --> 30:54.140
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

30:54.174 --> 30:55.575
Aah!

30:55.610 --> 30:58.845
Get the fuck out of here.
Get the fuck out of here.

31:02.297 --> 31:05.133
We'll hit it again
tomorrow, all right?

31:05.167 --> 31:07.635
You're exactly where
you're supposed to be.

31:09.938 --> 31:11.772
I'll be better tomorrow.

31:11.806 --> 31:14.242
Maybe.
Maybe you'll be worse.

31:14.276 --> 31:17.478
Let go of perfection.
Trust the process.

31:17.512 --> 31:19.980
Trust your coach, yeah?

31:20.014 --> 31:21.682
Yeah.

31:23.985 --> 31:25.168
All right.

31:29.758 --> 31:33.761
I, me, Lisa,
will get you a fight.

31:33.795 --> 31:36.130
No, you, Lisa, cannot.

31:36.164 --> 31:37.865
Yes, I can, you fucker.

31:37.899 --> 31:40.700
Do you know
what a tragedy it is

31:40.735 --> 31:42.769
that you're not fighting?

31:42.803 --> 31:45.605
I mean, you're a bouncer?

31:45.640 --> 31:48.207
In this shit box...
no offense, Tanya.

31:48.242 --> 31:49.409
Uh-huh.

31:49.443 --> 31:52.412
That's like Picasso
painting fucking murals

31:52.446 --> 31:54.681
on the side
of a kindergarten.

31:54.715 --> 31:56.548
Jay, you're really good.

31:56.583 --> 31:59.518
You're as good
as anybody in the gym.

31:59.552 --> 32:00.552
You're just
kind of an idiot.

32:00.587 --> 32:01.654
Yeah.

32:01.688 --> 32:03.856
That is a fucking
very valid point.

32:03.891 --> 32:06.092
So stop doing
idiot things.

32:06.126 --> 32:07.426
Alvey's not wrong, Lisa.

32:07.460 --> 32:09.695
Nobody wants to put me
on a fucking card.

32:09.729 --> 32:10.897
I've pissed off
a ton of promoters.

32:10.931 --> 32:13.299
Do you want to fight?

32:15.001 --> 32:17.503
Fuck. Yes. I do.

32:17.537 --> 32:18.970
Fine.

32:19.005 --> 32:22.541
Then, if I get you a fight
and put my ass out on the line,

32:22.575 --> 32:26.111
you're not gonna leave me
or not show up?

32:26.145 --> 32:30.048
I swear. On my mother.

32:30.082 --> 32:32.717
I'm not just gonna show up,

32:32.751 --> 32:35.821
but I will murder
any motherfucker

32:35.855 --> 32:37.856
you put in front of me.

32:40.392 --> 32:41.592
Deal.

32:46.031 --> 32:47.765
You fucking little hustler.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.233
It's very sexy.

32:49.267 --> 32:50.702
- Thank you.
- Very attractive.

32:50.736 --> 32:52.537
I see why my father
makes love to you

32:52.571 --> 32:54.434
every night after supper.

32:55.566 --> 32:59.977
Is he not gonna
be wondering where you are?

33:00.011 --> 33:01.813
Yes.

33:02.719 --> 33:05.021
Are you just fucking with him
because of Ryan?

33:08.954 --> 33:11.255
I wouldn't let Ryan
anywhere fucking near you.

33:11.289 --> 33:14.225
I think it's bat-shit crazy
he's at the gym.

33:14.259 --> 33:17.794
But this is just,
you know, me, a man,

33:17.829 --> 33:18.962
saying this
right fucking now...

33:18.996 --> 33:20.597
you don't let the wolf
through the front door.

33:22.933 --> 33:24.754
I mean, shit, Lisa.

33:26.250 --> 33:28.515
He pretends like
he doesn't want to fight.

33:29.340 --> 33:31.975
Then why is he back
at the fucking gym?

33:43.820 --> 33:46.722
Alvey, I don't have
the keys. I'm so sorry.

33:46.757 --> 33:48.291
- Ding, dong.
- It's really terrible.

33:48.325 --> 33:51.160
Got a delivery,
a nubile young woman

33:51.195 --> 33:53.496
for a virile,
much older man?

33:53.530 --> 33:54.630
He's not nice.

33:54.664 --> 33:56.231
- Come on. Come on.
- He's very virile.

33:56.266 --> 33:58.000
Come on. How much
has she had to drink?

33:58.034 --> 34:00.102
She's had exactly,
whoa, that much to drink.

34:00.136 --> 34:01.704
Why didn't you
fucking call me?

34:01.738 --> 34:03.873
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry I didn't call you.

34:03.907 --> 34:05.274
You're driving her
to drink, man.

34:05.308 --> 34:06.776
You should put a bucket
by your bed.

34:06.810 --> 34:08.576
Thanks for taking her home.
Be careful.

34:08.610 --> 34:09.777
- I'm sorry.
- Sleep tight.

34:09.812 --> 34:11.079
- All right. Come on.
- Hi.

34:11.114 --> 34:13.581
Oh, look.

34:13.616 --> 34:14.983
Look,
you want some water?

34:15.018 --> 34:16.952
No, fuck water.

34:16.985 --> 34:18.620
- No, fuck water.
- Fuck water.

34:18.654 --> 34:19.554
Let's go to bed.

34:19.588 --> 34:21.156
- No.
- Come on.

34:21.190 --> 34:22.757
- He's right.
- What?

34:22.792 --> 34:24.958
You're driving me
to drink.

34:24.993 --> 34:27.094
I know, baby.
I'm a shithead, okay?

34:27.129 --> 34:28.262
- No.
- I am. I'm a shithead.

34:28.297 --> 34:29.697
See, you can't just run over
what I'm saying.

34:29.732 --> 34:31.766
Um, like, you got
to listen to me.

34:31.801 --> 34:33.534
Okay, but can we talk
in the morning?

34:33.569 --> 34:34.902
No.

34:34.937 --> 34:36.737
If you really
were listening to me,

34:36.772 --> 34:38.540
then Ryan
wouldn't fucking be here.

34:38.574 --> 34:40.809
Ow!
Hey, girl.

34:42.110 --> 34:45.012
He wouldn't be here,
and you would hear me.

34:45.047 --> 34:46.947
All right, let's not.
Let's... tomorrow,

34:46.982 --> 34:49.516
I promise you we'll talk
about Ryan tomorrow, okay?

34:49.551 --> 34:50.851
Come on, baby.
You're drunk.

34:50.885 --> 34:52.652
Come on. Come on.

34:52.687 --> 34:54.521
- I want to have sex.
- What?

34:54.556 --> 34:55.688
I want to have sex.

34:55.723 --> 34:57.091
No,
you don't want to have sex.

34:57.125 --> 34:58.425
No, you don't want
to have sex.

34:58.460 --> 35:00.293
- Yeah, no, it'll be real nice.
- On the couch?

35:00.328 --> 35:01.227
Yeah, on the couch.

35:01.262 --> 35:02.262
Come here.
Come here.

35:02.296 --> 35:03.464
You come here.

35:03.498 --> 35:04.932
No, Alvey, no, no.
Please, I'm gonna throw up.

35:04.966 --> 35:06.032
You need...
you need some sleep.

35:06.067 --> 35:07.400
- Sleep.
- This is not good.

35:07.435 --> 35:08.702
- Come on. Come on.
- No.

35:12.707 --> 35:15.342
Keith, get up.

35:15.376 --> 35:17.610
It's breakfast time.
Sound good?

35:17.644 --> 35:19.779
No, I'm not hungry today.

35:19.813 --> 35:21.448
Bullshit, man.
I'm hungry.

35:21.482 --> 35:23.016
If I'm hungry,
you're fucking ravenous.

35:23.050 --> 35:24.484
Not today.

35:29.991 --> 35:31.090
You're scared of Michael.

35:31.124 --> 35:32.257
No, I'm not.

35:32.292 --> 35:34.494
I just don't want
to deal with him today.

35:34.528 --> 35:35.628
Here's the deal, man.

35:35.662 --> 35:37.563
If you don't stand up
to these guys,

35:37.598 --> 35:39.665
they're never gonna
leave you alone.

35:41.535 --> 35:43.669
What am I
supposed to do?

35:43.704 --> 35:45.270
It's actually
pretty simple.

35:45.305 --> 35:48.040
Next time they mess with you,
even a just a little bit,

35:48.074 --> 35:50.609
you got to hit 'em.

35:50.643 --> 35:52.611
Right on the jaw.

35:54.347 --> 35:56.581
But then
they'll hit back, so...

35:56.616 --> 35:58.617
Not if you hit 'em
hard enough.

35:58.651 --> 36:00.585
Look, you got... you got...
look at these...

36:00.620 --> 36:02.154
fists like a honey-baked ham, man.

36:02.188 --> 36:03.322
Honey-baked ham fists.

36:03.356 --> 36:05.580
You got to let 'em
feel your power,

36:05.630 --> 36:06.964
then they'll back off.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.134
You ever punched
anybody before?

36:17.822 --> 36:19.771
Like, in the face?

36:19.805 --> 36:21.441
Yeah,
like punch somebody.

36:22.408 --> 36:25.410
No, not... no, not in the face
I've punched.

36:25.444 --> 36:27.412
Okay, get up, I'll show you.

36:27.446 --> 36:29.055
Come on, get up.

36:31.294 --> 36:32.283
Come on.

36:32.317 --> 36:35.032
I'm gonna show you how
to stand up for yourself.

36:37.255 --> 36:38.856
All right.

36:38.890 --> 36:42.113
Now, curl your fingers like
this, all right, into a fist.

36:43.283 --> 36:44.995
Yeah, like that.

36:45.030 --> 36:45.996
All right.

36:46.031 --> 36:47.865
Now, you want to hit him

36:47.899 --> 36:49.299
with these two knuckles,
all right?

36:49.333 --> 36:51.068
These two hurt them,
the bottom two hurt you.

36:51.102 --> 36:52.135
You don't want that.

36:52.170 --> 36:53.770
These two hurt them,
these two hurt me.

36:53.804 --> 36:56.106
Exactly.
Now get your hands up.

36:57.025 --> 36:58.497
Just like that. Nice.

36:58.535 --> 37:00.377
Bend your knees
a little bit.

37:00.411 --> 37:02.045
Yeah, no,
like an athlete.

37:02.080 --> 37:04.347
Like an athlete,
come on, sturdy.

37:04.382 --> 37:07.084
Yeah.
Up. Nice.

37:07.118 --> 37:08.685
Okay, now, if you want
to hit me in the face,

37:08.719 --> 37:09.953
you got to imagine
that the target

37:09.987 --> 37:11.821
is like a foot behind me

37:11.855 --> 37:13.957
and you got to punch
through my face

37:13.991 --> 37:16.092
to hit that target.
You understand?

37:16.126 --> 37:18.160
Yeah, got...
okay, I got it.

37:18.195 --> 37:19.996
Okay,
go ahead and hit me.

37:23.366 --> 37:24.533
No, I don't want to,
though.

37:24.568 --> 37:25.802
Keith, Keith,
come on, look.

37:25.836 --> 37:27.436
I get punched in the face
for a living.

37:27.471 --> 37:28.504
This is not gonna hurt me.

37:28.538 --> 37:29.805
Right through it.
Come on.

37:29.839 --> 37:32.241
No, but it's not Michael.
It's you.

37:32.275 --> 37:33.775
Okay, you got to get
past this, Keith.

37:33.810 --> 37:35.544
You got to be willing to throw.

37:35.579 --> 37:37.179
Hit me. Hit me.

37:37.214 --> 37:38.947
No.
It might hurt.

37:38.982 --> 37:40.816
Hit me,
you fat fucking pussy.

37:40.850 --> 37:42.050
Come on, you deserved
that shit-water bath.

37:42.085 --> 37:44.152
- W-what?
- What? What?

37:44.186 --> 37:45.587
What, you bring it
on yourself, Keith.

37:45.622 --> 37:46.822
You're
a fucking weird dude.

37:46.856 --> 37:48.991
I'm not a weird fu...

37:49.025 --> 37:51.860
That's not how I talk!

37:51.894 --> 37:53.095
Dude, I will lock you
in this room

37:53.129 --> 37:54.096
and shut the lights off.

37:54.130 --> 37:55.163
Oh, you'd probably
like that.

37:55.197 --> 37:56.397
Then you can play

37:56.432 --> 37:57.532
with your gay little
fucking Teddy bear, right?

37:57.566 --> 38:00.368
Whacking your little
fucking piss pump...

38:00.402 --> 38:01.536
ohh.

38:01.570 --> 38:02.803
I'm sorry.

38:02.838 --> 38:04.405
That's...
that's a great start!

38:04.440 --> 38:05.406
That's great!

38:05.441 --> 38:07.442
But next time,
use your fist.

38:08.710 --> 38:11.045
Okay?
Not this, okay?

38:11.079 --> 38:13.848
Look at that.
What do we do next time?

38:13.882 --> 38:16.350
To... oh, make the ham fist,
then just...

38:16.384 --> 38:18.352
Boom! But, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

38:18.386 --> 38:21.355
Save it.
That's a good start.

38:21.389 --> 38:23.958
Let's get some breakfast.

38:23.992 --> 38:26.260
I'm sorry that I went there
with the bear,

38:26.294 --> 38:28.428
but I was just trying
to prove a point.

38:28.463 --> 38:30.865
It's cool.
He doesn't give a fuck.

38:30.899 --> 38:32.299
I thought so.

38:45.880 --> 38:47.381
It's fucking blended.

38:49.283 --> 38:52.518
What time
did you get home?

38:52.553 --> 38:54.287
I don't know, dude.

38:54.321 --> 38:58.725
Lisa and I,
we got after it.

39:00.795 --> 39:02.428
I'm sure
dad appreciated that.

39:02.466 --> 39:03.715
Yeah.

39:08.068 --> 39:10.236
- You want the rest?
- Oh, yeah.

39:10.270 --> 39:12.238
Here.

39:12.272 --> 39:15.441
- Come here.
- What?

39:15.475 --> 39:17.376
Come over here, Nate.

39:18.579 --> 39:21.046
Wait a second.

39:21.081 --> 39:23.648
Oh, boy.

39:23.683 --> 39:25.984
You smell exquisite.
What is this?

39:26.019 --> 39:28.053
I'm, like, walking through
a woods right now.

39:28.088 --> 39:30.022
I'm getting, like,
a... a Christmas cone.

39:30.056 --> 39:31.056
Sort of smell
like a, uh...

39:32.092 --> 39:33.192
Like a yummy
little vanilla.

39:33.226 --> 39:35.027
Yeah, it's soap.
I took a shower.

39:35.061 --> 39:36.829
- Soap?
- Yeah. Yeah.

39:36.863 --> 39:38.063
Where you going?

39:38.098 --> 39:39.831
I got physical therapy.

39:45.771 --> 39:47.038
You got a little crush?

39:49.108 --> 39:50.074
All right,
I'm out of here.

39:50.109 --> 39:51.343
Hey, stop.
Let me just... stop.

39:51.377 --> 39:52.644
No need to fight.
Let me just get one more whiff.

39:52.678 --> 39:53.678
Don't fight.

39:53.713 --> 39:55.780
Oh, Jesus.

39:58.817 --> 40:00.984
- You're an idiot.
- Ugh.

40:01.018 --> 40:02.185
See you later.

40:02.220 --> 40:03.220
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

40:03.254 --> 40:05.288
- Feel better.
- Have a great day, Nate.

40:53.003 --> 40:55.437
I'm sorry
about last night.

40:57.715 --> 40:59.608
You were wasted.

41:00.744 --> 41:03.245
Haven't seen you like that
in a long time.

41:03.279 --> 41:05.014
I think it's just gonna
take me a minute

41:05.048 --> 41:07.114
to get used
to having Ryan here.

41:09.918 --> 41:11.659
Me, too.

41:14.331 --> 41:17.492
I'm a fucking bully.
I'm a bulldozer.

41:17.527 --> 41:19.861
But I hear you.

41:19.895 --> 41:22.464
- Okay? I do.
- Do you?

41:22.498 --> 41:24.365
Yeah.

41:24.399 --> 41:26.534
I love you.

41:26.991 --> 41:29.598
I don't exist
without you.

41:29.632 --> 41:31.032
You know that.

41:31.067 --> 41:34.035
This place,
it's me and you.

41:38.699 --> 41:41.776
Alvey,
I can't clean this up.

41:42.377 --> 41:44.779
I mean, I feel like
you're creating

41:44.814 --> 41:47.415
this emotional and
professional cluster fuck

41:47.449 --> 41:48.750
that I can't untangle.

41:48.784 --> 41:50.585
Ryan fucks up one time,
he's out, he's gone.

41:50.620 --> 41:54.155
We move on. Case closed.

41:54.189 --> 41:55.523
I promise you that.

41:59.428 --> 42:02.463
Okay.

42:05.501 --> 42:08.503
You were fucking Janis Joplin
last night, okay?

42:08.537 --> 42:10.104
Ow! Never.

42:10.139 --> 42:11.205
You're a little bit filthy
when you're drunk.

42:11.240 --> 42:12.240
I was.

42:12.274 --> 42:14.508
It's not funny.

42:17.112 --> 42:20.380
Come here.

42:20.414 --> 42:22.249
I notice that
you're always gentle.

42:22.283 --> 42:25.152
Come here,
you little lush.

42:25.186 --> 42:28.088
Don't make me laugh.

42:28.123 --> 42:30.056
Oh, yeah. There it is.

42:30.090 --> 42:31.090
Oh, my God.

42:35.062 --> 42:37.096
Hey, where'd
your pride trophy go?

42:37.131 --> 42:38.632
Oh, the... the, uh...

42:38.666 --> 42:42.636
The guy on top broke,
so I'm having it fixed.

42:49.910 --> 42:51.144
You ever seen that?

42:51.178 --> 42:53.279
Yeah, I have.

42:53.313 --> 42:55.548
The only magic trick
I know.

42:55.582 --> 42:58.651
I'm glad
you called me, ma.

42:59.536 --> 43:02.492
I wanted to apologize
for the other night.

43:04.832 --> 43:08.794
I felt cornered,
a-and you're my baby.

43:11.731 --> 43:14.567
I didn't want you
to see me like that.

43:14.601 --> 43:17.303
I-I-I-I'm not always like that.

43:17.337 --> 43:18.870
There are whole parts
of my day

43:18.905 --> 43:20.839
that have nothing to do
with any of that.

43:20.873 --> 43:22.573
I don't see you then,
mom.

43:23.275 --> 43:24.334
I know.

43:28.314 --> 43:30.604
H-how's Nate doing?

43:31.321 --> 43:32.617
You know,
he's doing good.

43:34.725 --> 43:36.421
He's getting better.

43:36.455 --> 43:39.224
That's good.
That's good.

43:40.192 --> 43:41.926
He's so sweet.

43:43.529 --> 43:45.730
He never even really cried
when he was a baby.

43:45.764 --> 43:48.701
Your dad thought
he was autistic.

43:49.635 --> 43:53.637
But you, on the other hand,
would scream bloody murder

43:53.671 --> 43:55.572
for, like,
insane amounts of time.

43:55.607 --> 43:56.795
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

43:59.499 --> 44:01.645
You just wanted
to be picked up.

44:02.645 --> 44:05.850
I'd hold you and walk around,
and you'd be fine.

44:09.555 --> 44:12.289
Mnh, I used to walk with you
on the promenade,

44:12.323 --> 44:13.857
and people would stop

44:13.891 --> 44:16.426
and ask if you
were a gerber baby.

44:16.461 --> 44:19.028
Total strangers.

44:24.335 --> 44:26.502
Hey, guys.
What are we doing?

44:26.536 --> 44:28.950
We're just talking, Terry.

44:30.635 --> 44:33.044
She's not on the clock,
so...

44:33.778 --> 44:35.879
Why don't you
leave her alone?

44:35.913 --> 44:37.687
She's always on the clock.

44:37.724 --> 44:41.284
See, my girls wear
this big fucking neon sign

44:41.318 --> 44:44.353
that says
"open all the time."

44:44.388 --> 44:46.756
Hmm?

44:46.790 --> 44:50.426
I mean, um, I mean, they'll
fuck you at your convenience,

44:50.460 --> 44:51.794
but you do have to pay.

44:54.598 --> 44:56.699
- Jay!
- Take your fucking hands off of her.

44:56.733 --> 44:58.066
Jay!

44:58.101 --> 45:00.202
You have no idea
what I can do to you.

45:01.971 --> 45:05.174
And you have no idea
what I can do to her.

45:05.208 --> 45:08.010
Jay, please, let him go.
It's okay.

45:08.044 --> 45:11.113
There are people here.
Please.

45:11.147 --> 45:12.147
Jay.

45:24.226 --> 45:26.328
Is this your kid
or something?

45:28.564 --> 45:29.597
Hmm?

45:31.533 --> 45:32.867
Ohh.

45:43.178 --> 45:46.447
Don't worry.
I'm gonna take care of her.

45:50.552 --> 45:54.588
I mean, your mom is
a fucking thoroughbred, man.
