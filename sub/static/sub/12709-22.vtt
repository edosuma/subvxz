00:01.000 --> 00:03.170
Previously on
Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

00:03.204 --> 00:05.506
There's only one thing I've ever
been sure of-- you.

00:06.573 --> 00:07.875
You're the one, Buffy.

00:07.908 --> 00:09.710
Trying to turn a bunch
of little girls into an army?

00:09.743 --> 00:11.679
BUFFY:
 They're potential Slayers.

00:11.711 --> 00:14.714
We're dealing with a big bad
 that can be any dead person
 it wants.

00:14.747 --> 00:16.184
Where are we going?

00:16.216 --> 00:17.885
-BUFFY'S VOICE: Dearest Dawn.
-What's this?

00:17.917 --> 00:19.687
Don't be angry with Xander.

00:19.719 --> 00:22.222
-This isn't the place
 for either of you.
-(electrical crackling)

00:22.256 --> 00:25.658
A scythe forged in secrecy
for one like you.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.594
Does this mean I can win?

00:27.628 --> 00:30.397
CALEB:
 I was kind of hoping
 it would go this way.

00:30.431 --> 00:32.265
-Hey.
-(groans)

00:34.268 --> 00:36.570
At least you could tell me
you're glad to see me.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.539
That bitch.

00:46.780 --> 00:50.750
Well, I guess that qualifies
as happy to see me.

00:50.783 --> 00:53.686
Angel, what are you
doing h--

00:53.720 --> 00:57.057
Don't even.
I just want to bask.

00:59.792 --> 01:02.096
Okay, I'm basked.
What are you doing here?

01:02.130 --> 01:05.233
Not saving a damsel in distress,
that's for sure.

01:05.266 --> 01:08.936
Well, you know me.
Not much with the damseling.

01:08.968 --> 01:12.539
-Got your share
of distress though.
-You heard?

01:12.573 --> 01:14.775
I got coverage
on the whole thing.

01:14.807 --> 01:16.977
It's very gripping.
It needs a third act.

01:17.010 --> 01:20.781
-You have to leave L.A.
-It's the First, right?

01:20.813 --> 01:22.950
The First Evil?

01:22.983 --> 01:25.152
The power that tried to
convince me to kill myself?

01:25.186 --> 01:27.954
Yeah. It's gotten a little
more ambitious since then.

01:27.987 --> 01:30.990
-It's raising an army.
-Yeah, well, it failed once,
and I'm here to tell you--

01:33.826 --> 01:36.864
Are you ready
to finish this, bitch?

01:40.099 --> 01:41.368
(theme music playing)

02:40.894 --> 02:45.365
Okay. How many times
do I have to kill you?

02:45.399 --> 02:48.201
-Ballpark figure?
-You understand nothing.

02:59.913 --> 03:02.582
You think you have
power over me?

03:05.117 --> 03:09.088
Stupid girl!
You'll never stop me.

03:09.122 --> 03:11.259
-You don't have the--
-(blow lands)

03:11.292 --> 03:14.594
-(gasping)
-Who does nowadays?

03:18.598 --> 03:22.569
Okay. Now I'm pissed.
Where is he?

03:26.306 --> 03:28.709
He had to split.
(snickering)

03:29.909 --> 03:32.913
Yeah.
She needs you real bad.

03:32.945 --> 03:35.949
I'll have the guys go
through that, see
if there's anything new.

03:35.983 --> 03:39.118
-Reliable source?
-Not remotely.

03:39.151 --> 03:41.354
Mmm. Any port
in an apocalypse.

03:41.389 --> 03:44.123
I, uh, brought
somethin' else as well.

03:44.156 --> 03:47.927
I can already tell you
I have nothing that
goes with that.

03:47.961 --> 03:50.598
-It's not for you.
-Explainy?

03:50.631 --> 03:54.602
I don't know everything.
It's very powerful and probably
very dangerous.

03:54.634 --> 04:00.441
Has a purifying power
or cleansing power-
Possibly scrubbing bubbles.

04:00.473 --> 04:02.141
The translation
is, uh... Ugh.

04:02.175 --> 04:05.312
Anyway, it bestows strength to
the right person who wears it.

04:05.346 --> 04:08.282
-And the right person is?
-Someone ensouled.

04:08.316 --> 04:11.951
But stronger than human.
A champion. It isn't me.

04:11.985 --> 04:13.653
-Or me.
-No.

04:13.687 --> 04:16.290
I don't know nearly enough
about this to risk
you wearing it.

04:16.324 --> 04:19.927
Besides, you got
that real cool...

04:19.959 --> 04:21.995
ax thing goin' for you.

04:23.697 --> 04:26.800
So you're gonna
be with me in this?

04:26.834 --> 04:29.502
Shoulder to shoulder.
I'm yours.

04:29.536 --> 04:31.471
No.

04:31.504 --> 04:34.141
-"No" what?
-No.

04:34.173 --> 04:36.343
You're not gonna be
in this fight.

04:36.377 --> 04:39.680
-Why the hell not?
-Because I can't risk you.

04:39.713 --> 04:42.816
-You need me in this.
-No, I need you gone.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.319
Why?

04:46.720 --> 04:49.656
If I lose, if this thing
gets past Sunnydale,

04:49.689 --> 04:51.324
then it's days, maybe hours,

04:51.358 --> 04:53.661
before the rest
of the world goes.

04:53.694 --> 04:57.197
-I need a second front,
and I need you to run it.
-Okay.

04:58.899 --> 05:02.370
That's one reason.
What's the other?

05:03.536 --> 05:05.538
There is no other.

05:06.906 --> 05:08.908
Is it Spike?

05:11.077 --> 05:13.380
You're not tellin' me somethin'.

05:13.413 --> 05:16.483
And the scent--
I remember it pretty well.

05:16.516 --> 05:18.485
You vampires.

05:18.519 --> 05:20.853
Anybody ever you the whole
smelling people thing's
a little gross?

05:20.887 --> 05:24.557
-Is he your boyfriend?
-Is that your business?

05:25.526 --> 05:27.661
You in love with him?

05:27.694 --> 05:29.896
Okay, maybe
I'm out of line,

05:29.930 --> 05:31.731
but this is kind of
a curve ball for me.

05:31.764 --> 05:34.367
I mean, we are talkin'
about Spike here.

05:34.401 --> 05:37.204
It's different.
He's different.

05:37.237 --> 05:39.773
-He has a soul now.
-Oh.

05:41.408 --> 05:43.911
-Well.
-What?

05:43.944 --> 05:47.247
That's great.
Everyone's got a soul now.

05:47.279 --> 05:50.718
-He'll make a difference.
-You know, I started it,

05:50.750 --> 05:52.886
the whole having a soul,

05:52.920 --> 05:56.055
before it was all
the cool new thing.

05:56.088 --> 05:58.225
Oh, my god.
Are you 12?

05:58.257 --> 06:00.093
I'm gettin' the brush-off
for Captain Peroxide.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.396
It doesn't necessarily bring out
the champion in me.

06:02.430 --> 06:04.398
You're not getting
the brush-off.

06:04.432 --> 06:08.067
Are you just gonna come here
and go all Dawson on me
every time I have a boyfriend?

06:08.100 --> 06:11.738
-Aha! Boyfriend!
-He's not.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.908
But...

06:18.077 --> 06:20.112
he is in my heart.

06:20.146 --> 06:22.281
That'll end well.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.586
What was the highlight
of our relationship?

06:26.620 --> 06:29.790
When you broke up with me
or when I killed you?

06:29.822 --> 06:35.596
I'm well aware of my
stellar history with guys.

06:35.629 --> 06:38.932
(sighs)
And, no, I don't see...

06:38.966 --> 06:41.435
fat grandchildren
in the offing with Spike.

06:42.935 --> 06:45.404
And I don't think that
really matters right now.

06:48.141 --> 06:52.480
You know, in the midst
of all this... insanity...

06:52.512 --> 06:55.115
a couple of things are actually
starting to make sense.

06:55.148 --> 06:58.786
And the guy thing--

06:58.819 --> 07:01.855
(sighs)

07:01.954 --> 07:04.557
I always figured there was
something wrong with me,

07:04.591 --> 07:06.793
you know,
because I couldn't make it work.

07:06.826 --> 07:09.663
Maybe I'm not supposed to.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.831
Because you're the Slayer.

07:11.865 --> 07:14.968
Because--

07:15.002 --> 07:18.105
Okay.
I'm cookie dough.

07:20.206 --> 07:22.309
I'm not done baking.

07:22.341 --> 07:25.077
I'm not finished becoming

07:25.112 --> 07:28.148
whoever the hell it is
I'm gonna turn out to be.

07:29.550 --> 07:33.521
I make it through this
and the next thing...

07:33.553 --> 07:35.855
and the next thing, and...

07:35.889 --> 07:40.293
maybe one day I turn around
and realize I'm ready.

07:40.326 --> 07:42.663
I'm cookies.

07:42.696 --> 07:46.432
And then, you know,
if I want someone to eat--

07:46.466 --> 07:50.838
or enjoy warm, delicious...

07:50.870 --> 07:54.341
cookie me, then...

07:54.374 --> 07:56.776
that's fine.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.346
That'll be then.

07:59.379 --> 08:01.548
When I'm done.

08:01.581 --> 08:05.653
Any thoughts on
who might enjoy...

08:07.887 --> 08:10.524
Do I have to go
with the cookie analogy?

08:10.557 --> 08:13.661
I'm not really thinking
that far ahead.

08:14.862 --> 08:17.531
That's kind of the point.

08:27.274 --> 08:31.043
I'll go start workin'
on the second front.

08:31.077 --> 08:33.581
Make sure I don't
have to use it.

08:36.583 --> 08:38.586
Angel?

08:42.923 --> 08:45.725
I do...

08:45.759 --> 08:48.061
sometimes think
that far ahead.

08:48.095 --> 08:52.065
Sometimes is something.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.267
Be a long time coming.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.269
Years, if ever.

08:57.403 --> 08:59.606
I ain't gettin' any older.

09:14.955 --> 09:19.125
-Ow.
-Dumbass.

09:19.158 --> 09:22.596
Don't look at me.
This is a Summers thing.
It's all very violent.

09:25.465 --> 09:27.768
If you get killed,
I'm telling.

09:29.469 --> 09:31.938
Did you find out anything
about the scythe?

09:31.971 --> 09:34.307
It slices, dices,
and makes julienne preacher.

09:34.341 --> 09:37.977
-Caleb?
-I cut him in half.

09:38.010 --> 09:40.279
-All right!
-ANYA: He had that coming.

09:40.312 --> 09:42.615
Hey, party in my eye socket,
and everyone's invited.

09:45.485 --> 09:48.421
Sometimes
I shouldn't say words.

09:52.625 --> 09:55.763
So, where's tall,
dark and forehead?

09:55.796 --> 09:58.932
Let me guess.
You can smell him?

09:58.966 --> 10:01.467
Yeah. That, and I also used my
enhanced vampire eyeballs

10:01.500 --> 10:03.470
to watch you
kissing him.

10:07.039 --> 10:09.308
It was... a hello.

10:09.341 --> 10:12.011
Most people don't use
their tongues to say hello.

10:12.044 --> 10:15.148
Or I guess they do, but--

10:15.182 --> 10:19.485
There were no tongues.
Besides, he's gone.

10:19.519 --> 10:22.154
Oh, just popped by
for a quickie then?

10:22.188 --> 10:25.325
Good. Good. I haven't had
quite enough jealous vampire
crap for one night.

10:25.357 --> 10:26.326
He wears lifts, you know.

10:29.028 --> 10:32.932
You know, one of these days I'm
just gonna put you two in a room
and let you rassle it out.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.501
-No problem at this end.
-Hmm.

10:35.534 --> 10:38.337
There could be oil
of some kind involved.

10:38.370 --> 10:40.506
-Where's the trinket?
-The "who-ket"?

10:40.539 --> 10:44.277
The pretty necklace
your sweetie-bear gave you.
The one with all the power.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.544
I believe it's mine now.

10:47.547 --> 10:52.019
-How do you figure?
-Someone with a soul,
but more than human.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.485
Angel meant to wear it.

10:53.519 --> 10:55.488
That means
I'm the qualified party.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.359
It's volatile.
We don't know--

10:59.392 --> 11:01.193
You'll be needing someone strong
to bear it then.

11:01.227 --> 11:03.363
You plannin'
on givin' it to Andrew?

11:07.366 --> 11:11.038
Angel said the amulet was meant
to be worn by a champion.

11:29.221 --> 11:32.558
Been called a lot
of things in my time.

11:32.591 --> 11:36.596
Faith still has my room.

11:36.629 --> 11:38.197
Well, you're not stayin' here.

11:38.230 --> 11:42.402
You can't buy me off with
shiny beads and sweet talk.

11:42.434 --> 11:44.571
You got Angel breath.

11:44.604 --> 11:47.407
I'm not gonna just let you
whack me back and forth
like a rubber ball.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.408
I've got my pride, you know?

11:49.442 --> 11:52.078
I understand.

11:52.111 --> 11:56.283
Clearly you don't, 'cause
the whole "havin' my pride"
thing was just a smoke screen.

11:56.316 --> 11:59.052
Oh, thank god.

12:02.288 --> 12:05.457
I don't know what I would
have done if you'd have gone
up those stairs.

12:44.463 --> 12:47.433
Pretty, ain't it?

12:47.466 --> 12:51.504
-You're not him.
-No, you killed him,
right and proper.

12:51.538 --> 12:56.408
Terrible loss.
This man was my good right arm.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.411
Course, it don't
pain me too much.

12:58.445 --> 13:01.815
Don't need an arm.
Got an army.

13:01.849 --> 13:05.152
An army of vampires.
However will I fight--

13:05.184 --> 13:07.120
Every day
our numbers swell.

13:07.153 --> 13:09.489
But then you do have
an army of your own.

13:09.522 --> 13:13.159
Some 30-odd pimply-faced girls
don't know the pointy end
of a stake.

13:13.192 --> 13:16.296
-Maybe I should call this off.
-You ever considered
a cool name?

13:16.328 --> 13:19.265
I mean, since you're incorporeal
and basically powerless.

13:19.298 --> 13:22.302
How about the Taunter?
Strikes fear in the heart of--

13:22.335 --> 13:24.171
I will overrun this Earth.

13:24.203 --> 13:27.006
And when my army outnumbers
the humans on this Earth,

13:27.039 --> 13:31.711
the scales will tip,
and I will be made flesh.

13:31.744 --> 13:35.381
Talk on.
I'm not afraid of you.

13:35.414 --> 13:39.351
Then why aren't you asleep
in your dead lover's arms?

13:43.056 --> 13:44.823
'Cause he can't help you.

13:47.394 --> 13:50.529
Nor Faith.
Nor your friends.

13:50.562 --> 13:53.365
Certainly not your
wanna-slay brigade.

13:53.399 --> 13:56.369
None of those girlies
will ever know real power
unless you're dead.

13:56.403 --> 13:58.538
Now, you know the drill.

13:59.605 --> 14:02.208
Into every generation,
a Slayer is born.

14:02.241 --> 14:04.878
One girl
in all the world.

14:04.912 --> 14:07.614
She alone will have
the strength and skill to--

14:08.748 --> 14:11.018
There's that word again.

14:11.051 --> 14:13.552
What you are.
How you'll die...

14:13.586 --> 14:15.554
alone.

14:18.857 --> 14:21.394
Where's your snappy comeback?

14:23.363 --> 14:25.331
You're right.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.600
Hmm.
Not your best.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.701
I'm drowning in Cool Whip.

14:33.605 --> 14:35.575
Weird dream.

14:37.309 --> 14:38.610
Buffy.

14:41.447 --> 14:43.582
-Is there something wrong?
-No.

14:43.615 --> 14:45.251
Yeah.

14:46.452 --> 14:49.022
I just realized something.

14:49.056 --> 14:53.259
Something that really
never occurred to me before.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.129
We're gonna win.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.442
What do you think?

15:10.476 --> 15:12.445
That depends.

15:12.479 --> 15:15.615
Are you in any way...
kidding?

15:15.648 --> 15:17.616
You don't think
it's a good idea?

15:17.649 --> 15:21.553
-It's pretty radical, B.
-It's a lot more than that.

15:21.587 --> 15:25.993
Buffy, what you said,
it-it flies in the face
of everything we've ever--

15:26.025 --> 15:30.230
every generation has ever done
in the fight against evil.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.932
I think it's bloody brilliant.

15:34.634 --> 15:38.071
-You mean that?
-If you want my opinion.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.006
-Really do.
-Whoa.

15:40.039 --> 15:42.942
Hey. Not to-to poop
on the party her,

15:42.975 --> 15:45.177
but I'm the guy
that's gonna have to
pull this thing off.

15:45.211 --> 15:47.246
It is beaucoup de mojo.

15:47.279 --> 15:49.682
This goes beyond anything
I've ever done.

15:49.716 --> 15:52.318
It's a total loss of control,

15:52.351 --> 15:57.590
and not in a nice, wholesome,
"my girlfriend has a pierced
tongue" kind of way.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.326
I wouldn't ask if I didn't
think you could do it.

15:59.359 --> 16:03.429
I-- I'm not sure
that I'm stable enough.

16:03.462 --> 16:06.599
You can do this, Willow.
We'll get the coven

16:06.633 --> 16:09.168
on the line,
and-and we'll find out
how they can help.

16:09.201 --> 16:11.203
-I'll--
-Oh!

16:11.238 --> 16:13.273
Pierced tongue.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.607
-Dawn needs to do
a research thing.
-Yes, you do.

16:15.642 --> 16:19.546
It's cool.
Watcher Junior to the library.

16:19.578 --> 16:22.615
I'll go dig up my sources--
quite literally, actually.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.650
-Come on.
-The only two people
I have to speak to are dead.

16:24.683 --> 16:26.019
Let's go assemble
the cannon fodder.

16:26.052 --> 16:27.220
That's not what
we're callin' 'em, sweetie.

16:27.254 --> 16:29.556
Not to their faces.
What, am I insensitive?

16:37.096 --> 16:39.032
BUFFY:
I hate this.

16:39.066 --> 16:42.469
I hate being here.

16:42.501 --> 16:45.738
I hate that you
have to be here.

16:45.837 --> 16:48.408
I hate that there's evil

16:48.441 --> 16:50.876
and that I was chosen
to fight it.

16:50.909 --> 16:53.546
I wish a whole lot of the time
that I hadn't been.

16:53.580 --> 16:57.384
I know a lot of you wish
I hadn't been either.

16:58.585 --> 17:01.087
This isn't about wishes.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.056
This is about choices.

17:03.090 --> 17:06.558
I believe
we can beat this evil.

17:06.593 --> 17:11.663
Not when it comes.
Not when its army is ready. Now.

17:11.698 --> 17:16.502
Tomorrow morning,
I'm opening the Seal.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.439
I'm going down
into the Hellmouth, and I am
finishing this once and for all.

17:21.141 --> 17:25.444
Right now you're asking yourself
what makes this different.

17:25.478 --> 17:30.517
What makes us anything more
than a bunch of girls being
picked off one by one?

17:30.549 --> 17:35.288
It's true. None of you have
the power that Faith and I do.

17:36.455 --> 17:38.290
So, here's the part
where you make a choice.

17:41.627 --> 17:43.730
It's one hell
of a risky idea.

17:43.762 --> 17:45.731
Buffy's wacky that way.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.599
Yeah. There's one more vent
right by the stairs.

17:47.634 --> 17:51.238
If we block that,
they got no sewer access.

17:51.270 --> 17:53.573
That should
drive them straight up
into the school proper.

17:53.605 --> 17:56.942
-That's assuming
they get past us.
-Which, no offense, I am.

17:56.976 --> 17:58.978
Come on. You gotta have
a little faith.

17:59.010 --> 18:01.713
I think I've had
my share, thanks.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.951
Well, I trundled right
into that one, didn't I?

18:04.983 --> 18:09.622
Look, I'm sorry if it seemed
like I was blowing you off
the other day.

18:09.655 --> 18:13.058
I was just trying to,
you know, blow you off.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.894
Yeah, you know what?
I figured that one out
all by myself.

18:15.928 --> 18:20.098
It's nothin' personal.
It's just, after I get
bouncy with a guy,

18:20.133 --> 18:22.434
there's not that much more
I need to know about him.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.737
-That's bleak.
-The way of the world.

18:24.770 --> 18:27.307
That's good to know, 'cause for
a second there, I thought
it was more

18:27.339 --> 18:30.309
defensive, isolationist
Slayer crap.

18:30.343 --> 18:32.311
(chuckling)
And he comes out swingin'.

18:32.345 --> 18:36.182
Faith, there's a whole world
out there that you don't even
know about,

18:36.215 --> 18:39.486
and a lot of the men in it
are pretty decent guys.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.520
They'd surprise you.

18:41.554 --> 18:45.692
A guy looks at me,
let's just say
his priorities shift.

18:45.724 --> 18:49.095
-Oh, why? Because you're so hot?
-It is what it is, yo.

18:49.127 --> 18:51.830
Oh, please.
I am so much prettier
than you are.

18:51.864 --> 18:54.534
Oh, and, uh,
for the record...

18:54.567 --> 19:00.006
our little encounter
didn't exactly change my world.

19:00.038 --> 19:03.210
You're trippin'.
That was rock 'em, sock 'em.

19:03.242 --> 19:05.877
Oh, no, no, no. It was--
it was nice enough, you know,

19:05.912 --> 19:10.517
and-and you're--
you're very, um, mmm, enthused,

19:10.549 --> 19:13.353
and I think with a little
more experience, you--

19:13.385 --> 19:18.357
-Dude, I got mad skills.
-Yeah, of course.
Let's finish up.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.893
Oh, hell with that.
We're goin' again, baby.

19:20.926 --> 19:23.529
-You're gonna learn
a little respect here, pal.
-Faith--

19:23.563 --> 19:25.565
Make me a deal, all right?

19:25.597 --> 19:30.903
We live through this,
you give me the chance
to surprise you.

19:30.936 --> 19:32.872
What will be
the surprise?

19:32.971 --> 19:37.376
You do know the meaning
of the word, right?

19:38.911 --> 19:40.880
(buckling belt)
Fine. Deal.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.914
Good enough.

19:45.084 --> 19:47.920
-No way you're prettier than me.
-Little bit, yeah.

19:50.088 --> 19:52.858
I really wish she hadn't
said that about me.

19:52.892 --> 19:55.228
What?
The thing Buffy said?

19:55.261 --> 19:58.865
-I think it's true.
-(whimpers)

19:58.897 --> 20:01.933
I'll be with you
to keep you grounded.

20:01.968 --> 20:06.272
Yeah, well, you might
have to keep me "stab-ded"
if I go to the bad place.

20:08.974 --> 20:11.176
You're sayin' I might
have to kill you.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.346
-I am.
-Bite me!

20:13.380 --> 20:17.284
I will.
I mean, I do... mean it.

20:19.286 --> 20:21.387
The darkest place
I've ever been,

20:21.421 --> 20:23.490
this is what lies beyond that.

20:25.325 --> 20:28.595
-This is too important for me--
-Buffy believes in you.

20:28.627 --> 20:32.432
You know Buffy?
Sweet girl. Not that bright.

20:32.464 --> 20:36.302
Hey, I'm the first one
to call her out
when she's not making sense.

20:36.336 --> 20:39.806
In fact, this may have
escaped your keen notice,

20:39.838 --> 20:43.041
but I'm...
kind of a brat.

20:43.075 --> 20:46.613
I've always sort of
gotten my way.

20:46.645 --> 20:50.317
So, you're gonna
make it through this,
no matter how dark it gets.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.486
Because now...

20:53.519 --> 20:55.521
you're my way.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.336
I'd better
go over this again.

21:13.539 --> 21:16.643
I-I'm all turned around.
Y-You're here, yeah?

21:16.675 --> 21:18.810
By the pillar, yeah.
Protecting this area.

21:18.845 --> 21:21.948
That puts me over by the door.
Demons around the perimeter.

21:21.980 --> 21:24.150
Right.
I open the door.

21:24.182 --> 21:27.920
"You go through the door and are
confronted by Trogdor
the Burninator."

21:27.953 --> 21:30.490
Oh, bugger.
It's a fight.

21:30.522 --> 21:33.992
Adios to five hit points.
"Trogdor has badly wounded you."

21:34.026 --> 21:36.663
Wait a minute.
What about my,
uh, bag of illusions?

21:36.695 --> 21:39.499
(scoffs)
Illusions against a Burninator?

21:39.531 --> 21:42.167
Silly, silly British man.

21:42.201 --> 21:45.171
I invoke a time flux
on Trogdor.

21:45.203 --> 21:47.839
-Step down, girlfriend.
You can't just--
-Ninth-level sorcerer

21:47.874 --> 21:50.209
and I carry
the Emerald Chalice.

21:50.241 --> 21:52.979
Trogdor is frozen in time.
Deal with it.

21:53.011 --> 21:55.682
Smackdown on Red Riding Hood.
This could get ugly.

21:55.714 --> 21:58.451
How could it possibly
get uglier? I used to be
a highly respected Watcher

21:58.484 --> 22:03.288
and now I'm a wounded dwarf
with the mystical strength
of a doily.

22:03.321 --> 22:05.525
I just wish
I could sleep.

22:05.557 --> 22:08.861
What kind of person could sleep
on a night like this?

22:08.894 --> 22:10.396
Only the crazy ones.

22:10.430 --> 22:12.999
(snoring softly)

22:33.586 --> 22:36.055
(footsteps approaching)

22:58.144 --> 23:00.779
Welcome to Sunnydale High.

23:00.813 --> 23:04.717
There's no running in the halls,
no yelling, no gum chewing.

23:04.750 --> 23:06.752
Apart from that,
there's only one rule.

23:06.786 --> 23:10.923
-If they move, kill them.
-Okay. Potentials,
in the basement.

23:10.957 --> 23:14.259
-Follow Faith and Spike.
-XANDER: If you have to go to
the bathroom, it's to your left.

23:14.292 --> 23:16.729
If you don't have to go to
the bathroom, picture what
you're about to face.

23:16.762 --> 23:20.298
Better to go now.

23:20.332 --> 23:23.769
-Willow, my office is
straight through there.
-It's right over the Seal.

23:23.803 --> 23:26.739
-I'll start getting you set up.
-Thanks.

23:26.772 --> 23:30.977
Okay. Civilians.
If the vampires get upstairs,

23:31.009 --> 23:32.545
we have three areas
they can get through

23:32.578 --> 23:35.114
to another building
and then down into the sewers,

23:35.146 --> 23:37.083
down the hall in the atrium...

23:37.115 --> 23:39.652
the north hall here,
and the primary target:

23:39.685 --> 23:41.386
through the lounge, straight
to the science building.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.222
Now, odds are
most of them will head there.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.992
Teams of two then. I suggest
you and I take the lounge.

23:47.026 --> 23:49.961
-I concur.
-Xander, I want you with Dawn.

23:49.996 --> 23:52.999
-I concur.
-We'll check out the atrium.

23:53.031 --> 23:56.335
So that leaves me
and the Dungeon Master
in the north hall?

23:56.367 --> 23:59.638
-We will defend it
with our very lives.
-Yes.

23:59.672 --> 24:01.641
We will defend it
with his very life.

24:01.673 --> 24:05.644
-And don't be afraid to
use him as a human shield.
-Good. Yes. Thanks.

24:05.678 --> 24:09.315
I just want to say
how proud I am to die

24:09.347 --> 24:12.151
for this very special
cause with you guys.

24:12.183 --> 24:14.487
There's some, um--

24:14.520 --> 24:17.355
there's some people
I'd like to thank...

24:17.388 --> 24:20.326
both good and evil. Um...

24:20.358 --> 24:22.494
a shout-out to
my brother Tucker...

24:22.528 --> 24:25.463
who gave me the inspiration
to summon demons...

24:25.498 --> 24:27.866
-and also--
-Nobody cares,
you little monkey.

24:29.568 --> 24:32.505
I'm gonna check out
our field of engagement.

24:35.040 --> 24:36.643
-Dawn--
-No.

24:40.011 --> 24:42.714
Anything you say is gonna
sound like goodbye.

25:09.375 --> 25:13.211
-So, what do you guys want
to do tomorrow?
-Nothing strenuous.

25:13.244 --> 25:15.346
Well, mini-golf is always
the first thing that comes
to mind.

25:15.381 --> 25:17.884
-I think we can do
better than that.
-I was thinking about shopping,

25:17.916 --> 25:20.586
-as per usual.
-Oh, there's an Arden B.
in the new mall.

25:20.619 --> 25:21.688
I could use a few items.

25:21.721 --> 25:22.755
Are we gonna discuss this?

25:22.788 --> 25:24.557
Save the world
or go to the mall?

25:24.590 --> 25:26.726
-I'm having
a wicked shoe craving.
-Aren't you on the patch?

25:26.759 --> 25:29.428
-Those never work.
-And here I am,
invisible to the eye.

25:29.461 --> 25:31.998
See, I need a new look.
It's this whole eye patch thing.

25:32.030 --> 25:34.400
Oh! You could go
with the full black
secret-agent look.

25:34.432 --> 25:36.402
Or the puffy shirt,
the pirate slash...

25:36.434 --> 25:38.203
The Earth
is definitely doomed.

26:09.101 --> 26:11.103
You first, B.

26:37.496 --> 26:38.897
WILLOW:
They should be in place.

26:38.931 --> 26:41.933
Okay.
Magic time.

26:41.968 --> 26:45.436
You ready to...
(nervous chuckle) kill me?

26:45.471 --> 26:48.173
Starting to be.

26:48.207 --> 26:50.142
Good. Fun.

26:50.175 --> 26:52.577
Great.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.846
Brace yourself.

26:54.881 --> 26:56.682
Come on, Red.

26:58.549 --> 27:00.519
Make it happen.

27:01.988 --> 27:03.955
Not to be a buzz kill, luv,

27:03.990 --> 27:07.192
but my fabulous accessory
isn't exactly tingling
with power.

27:07.226 --> 27:10.496
-I'm not worried.
-I'm getting zero juice here.

27:10.528 --> 27:13.598
-And I look
like Elizabeth Taylor.
-Cheer up, Liz.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.835
If Willow's big spell
doesn't work,

27:15.867 --> 27:18.003
it won't matter
what you wear.

27:18.037 --> 27:20.038
I'm not worried.

27:23.541 --> 27:26.746
-(vampires snarling)
-(metal clanging)

27:48.567 --> 27:51.369
-I'm not worried.
-RONA: Really?

27:51.403 --> 27:55.207
-'Cause I'm flashing back to
Xander's whole bathroom speech.
-Buffy?

27:55.240 --> 27:56.508
I'm not worried.

27:56.541 --> 28:00.412
Long as Willow can work
her spell before they...

28:00.445 --> 28:02.048
-see us.
-(roaring)

28:12.759 --> 28:13.726
Willow?

28:20.799 --> 28:23.769
Oh... my... goddess.

28:26.438 --> 28:29.540
So here's the part
where you make a choice.

28:29.575 --> 28:32.744
What if you could
have that power? Now?

28:32.778 --> 28:36.248
In every generation,
one Slayer is born

28:36.281 --> 28:38.616
because a bunch of men who died

28:38.650 --> 28:41.953
thousands of years ago
made up that rule.

28:41.988 --> 28:43.555
They were powerful men.

28:43.588 --> 28:47.026
This woman...
is more powerful
than all of them combined.

28:47.058 --> 28:48.559
Mmm.

28:50.229 --> 28:53.065
So, I say
we change the rule.

28:53.098 --> 28:56.634
I say my power
should be our power.

28:59.270 --> 29:02.775
Tomorrow, Willow will use
 the essence of the scythe

29:02.808 --> 29:04.343
to change our destiny.

29:05.811 --> 29:08.480
From now on,
every girl in the world

29:08.513 --> 29:10.950
who might be a Slayer

29:10.982 --> 29:12.951
will be a Slayer.

29:12.984 --> 29:17.222
Every girl who could
 have the power,
 will have the power.

29:17.256 --> 29:21.492
Can stand up, will stand up.

29:21.527 --> 29:23.628
Slayers.

29:23.662 --> 29:25.530
Every one of us.

29:26.531 --> 29:28.334
Make your choice.

29:29.667 --> 29:32.104
Are you ready to be strong?

29:37.209 --> 29:38.810
These guys are dust.

30:01.067 --> 30:03.035
Willow?

30:16.682 --> 30:19.852
You... are a goddess.

30:19.885 --> 30:22.653
And you're a Slayer.

30:22.688 --> 30:24.690
-(scythe scrapes)
-Get this to Buffy.

30:31.563 --> 30:33.565
Ha! That was nifty.

30:44.210 --> 30:45.344
Buffy!

30:46.112 --> 30:47.212
Catch!

30:59.424 --> 31:01.259
I could get used to this.

31:17.108 --> 31:19.411
They're leaving!
They're retreating!

31:19.444 --> 31:22.614
I think they're coming.

31:22.647 --> 31:25.717
Oh, god. I'm terrified.

31:25.750 --> 31:26.952
I didn't think.

31:26.986 --> 31:29.087
I mean, I-- I just figured
you'd be terrified

31:29.121 --> 31:31.623
and I would be
sarcastic about it.

31:31.656 --> 31:34.526
Picture happy things.
A lake.

31:34.559 --> 31:36.996
Candy canes.
Bunnies.

31:38.630 --> 31:40.967
Bunnies.

31:41.000 --> 31:45.570
Floppy, hoppy...
bunnies.

32:03.521 --> 32:05.423
I have swimmer's ear!

32:15.968 --> 32:16.934
Buffy!

32:18.670 --> 32:21.640
Look at this thing now.

32:21.673 --> 32:24.809
I think it's--
(groans)

32:24.843 --> 32:26.278
Keep the line together!

32:26.311 --> 32:28.146
Drive them to the edge!
We can't let them--

32:50.301 --> 32:51.670
Buffy!

32:59.244 --> 33:01.247
Hold the line.

33:06.917 --> 33:09.755
(gasping)

33:26.271 --> 33:29.375
We call it
the greenhouse effect.
Very dangerous.

33:49.795 --> 33:51.462
Rona!

34:07.878 --> 34:09.914
Oh, no. Ow.

34:10.981 --> 34:14.985
Mommy, this mortal wound
is all itchy.

34:17.655 --> 34:19.958
You pulled a nice trick.

34:19.989 --> 34:23.594
You came pretty close
to smacking me down.

34:23.628 --> 34:25.831
What more do you want?

34:27.998 --> 34:30.601
I want you...

34:32.402 --> 34:35.172
to get out of my face.

35:20.985 --> 35:22.320
Oh, bollocks.

35:28.626 --> 35:31.128
-Buffy!
-Spike!

35:39.237 --> 35:41.507
Everybody out!
Now!

35:46.077 --> 35:49.047
-I can feel it, Buffy.
-What?

35:50.981 --> 35:52.983
My soul.

35:54.085 --> 35:56.887
It's really there.

35:58.190 --> 35:59.824
Kinda stings.

36:14.539 --> 36:16.342
POTENTIAL:
Get out of the way!

36:16.375 --> 36:19.545
-What?
-Hurry up!

36:24.048 --> 36:26.083
-The bus.
-Get 'em on the bus!

36:26.117 --> 36:28.954
Everybody, this way!

36:31.422 --> 36:34.092
Anya?

36:34.125 --> 36:36.126
Anya?

36:41.467 --> 36:42.900
Go on, then.

36:42.934 --> 36:45.436
No. No, you've done enough.
You could still--

36:45.471 --> 36:48.474
No. You've beat them back.
It's for me to do the clean-up.

36:50.742 --> 36:52.077
Buffy, come on!

36:54.079 --> 36:55.547
Gotta move, lamb.

36:55.581 --> 36:57.983
Think it's fair to say,
school's out for bloody summer.

37:00.385 --> 37:02.320
-Spike--
-I mean it. I gotta do this.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.655
I love you.

37:40.157 --> 37:43.429
No, you don't.

37:43.461 --> 37:46.097
But thanks for sayin' it.

37:51.469 --> 37:52.471
Now go!

37:56.675 --> 37:58.777
I want to see how it ends.

38:29.641 --> 38:31.909
(chuckling)

38:38.048 --> 38:39.184
Oh, it's okay.

38:44.690 --> 38:47.057
Look at me!
This is nothing!

38:47.092 --> 38:49.527
Stay awake!
This is nothing!

38:51.896 --> 38:53.898
Why didn't I die?

39:31.469 --> 39:33.438
Ease off.
We're clear.

40:01.398 --> 40:04.503
I don't understand.
What did this?

40:07.838 --> 40:09.840
Spike.

40:25.289 --> 40:27.291
So did you see?

40:28.626 --> 40:30.596
I-I was scared.
I'm sorry.

40:30.628 --> 40:33.130
Did you see what happened?
I mean, was she--

40:37.635 --> 40:39.538
She was incredible.

40:41.371 --> 40:43.974
She died saving my life.

40:47.378 --> 40:50.981
That's my girl.
Always doing the stupid thing.

40:57.121 --> 40:59.525
FAITH:
It's not bad. You just sit here.

40:59.557 --> 41:02.661
-I'll get someone to--
-Hey.

41:02.693 --> 41:05.530
Did-- did we make it?

41:09.835 --> 41:12.704
We made it.
We won.

41:32.523 --> 41:35.260
(coughing)

41:42.067 --> 41:44.034
Surprise.

41:57.014 --> 42:00.652
Looks like the Hellmouth
is officially closed
or business.

42:00.686 --> 42:03.021
There's another one
in Cleveland,

42:03.054 --> 42:05.090
not to spoil the moment.

42:06.123 --> 42:08.594
We saved the world.

42:08.626 --> 42:10.427
We changed the world.

42:11.730 --> 42:14.164
I can feel them, Buffy.

42:14.199 --> 42:16.166
All over.

42:16.201 --> 42:19.036
Slayers are awakening
everywhere.

42:19.070 --> 42:21.606
-We'll have to find them.
-We will.

42:21.639 --> 42:23.942
Yes, because the mall
was actually in Sunnydale...

42:23.974 --> 42:26.043
so there's no hope
of going there tomorrow.

42:26.077 --> 42:29.347
We destroyed the mall?
I fought on the wrong side.

42:29.380 --> 42:31.449
All those shops gone.

42:31.481 --> 42:34.385
The Gap, Starbucks,
Toys "R" Us.

42:34.418 --> 42:36.186
Who will remember
all those landmarks

42:36.221 --> 42:37.755
unless we tell
the world about them?

42:37.789 --> 42:40.125
We have a lot of work
ahead of us.

42:40.157 --> 42:42.260
-Can I push him in?
-You've got my vote.

42:42.293 --> 42:45.630
I just want to sleep, yo.
For, like, a week.

42:45.664 --> 42:48.432
I guess we all could,
if we wanted to.

42:48.465 --> 42:52.137
Yeah. The First
is scrunched, so...

42:52.170 --> 42:54.873
What do you think
we should do, Buffy?

42:54.905 --> 42:57.708
Yeah, you're not the one
and only Chosen anymore.

42:57.742 --> 43:01.278
Just gotta live like a person.
How's that feel?

43:01.311 --> 43:05.150
Yeah, Buffy.
What are we gonna do now?

43:22.867 --> 43:24.168
(theme music playing)

43:41.952 --> 43:43.889
Grr! Arrgh!
