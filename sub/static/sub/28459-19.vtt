- We're being honest.
- Well, I'm being honest too.

34:27.300 --> 34:29.533
Does my honesty not count?

34:29.567 --> 34:31.233
- Here's the thing.
I like Erika,

34:31.266 --> 34:32.734
but it was uncomfortable
last night,

34:32.766 --> 34:36.300
and it could've easily been
resolved by being honest.

34:36.333 --> 34:37.533
- She's doing the best she can.

34:37.567 --> 34:39.367
We all are doing
the best we can.

34:39.400 --> 34:41.699
- But it feels like a lie.

34:41.734 --> 34:43.400
- I'm being honest that,
like,

34:43.433 --> 34:44.766
that I felt, like,
honest that I--

34:45.000 --> 34:47.266
- How 'bout let's be honest
in the morning.

34:47.300 --> 34:49.600
I think that'd probably
be best for all of us.

34:49.632 --> 34:52.367
- Okay.
- Okay?

34:52.400 --> 34:54.367
- When we sit down
and we have breakfast,

34:54.400 --> 34:55.699
and I feel uncomfortable,

34:55.734 --> 34:57.433
it's not a
----ing good morning.

34:57.467 --> 34:59.300
- I was telling the girls that,
you know,

34:59.333 --> 35:02.367
I organized to go
to the winery at 1:30.

35:02.400 --> 35:06.567
- Hmm.

35:06.600 --> 35:09.033
- Well, maybe you should say,
"I feel uncomfortable."

35:09.066 --> 35:11.633
- I can't be expected to be
the moral compass

35:11.667 --> 35:14.033
for everybody all the time.
- You're not.

35:14.066 --> 35:15.500
- But then you guys
hold me to that.

35:15.533 --> 35:17.600
- No, we don't. No.
No, Teddi--Teddi.

35:17.633 --> 35:19.767
- Oh, "Teddi, are you
the accountability control?"

35:20.000 --> 35:21.333
- No, let me tell you
something.

35:21.367 --> 35:22.567
- No, but you see
what I'm saying.

35:22.600 --> 35:24.467
- You know what?
- It's not my job.

35:24.500 --> 35:26.066
- Teddi, you hold yourself
to being the moral compass,

35:26.100 --> 35:27.600
and you need to stop.

35:27.633 --> 35:29.300
- Get out of here.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

35:33.734 --> 35:36.266
- Take yourself off the hook.

35:36.300 --> 35:38.667
That is the confusion to me.

35:38.700 --> 35:41.433
- Okay, I understand that,
but it's--

35:41.467 --> 35:43.667
- It all seems fake to me.

35:43.700 --> 35:46.000
- Teddi's had a lot of
cocktails,

35:46.033 --> 35:47.667
and when you have a lot of
cocktails,

35:47.700 --> 35:50.333
it's like truth serum,
and it just starts pouring out.

35:50.367 --> 35:52.600
You guys have grown so much.

35:52.633 --> 35:54.367
- I don't want to bleed
all over your sheets.

35:54.400 --> 35:55.734
- Oh, my gosh. I'm not angry.
I'm not mad.

35:55.767 --> 35:57.500
My feelings aren't hurt.
None of those things.

35:57.533 --> 35:59.433
It's just in my mind,
that's weird.

35:59.467 --> 36:02.066
- I think it's weird that
you should care. It's possible.

36:02.100 --> 36:05.400
- You pretending that it's full
amnesia right now is confusing.

36:05.433 --> 36:07.500
- Don't ever say
that to me again. Don't.

36:07.533 --> 36:10.333
- Okay.
- Don't take a step back.

36:10.367 --> 36:12.333
- She does what she needs to do

36:12.367 --> 36:14.300
to make you feel good,
but then--

36:14.333 --> 36:15.734
- What's wrong with that?

36:15.767 --> 36:18.066
- That's fine in a fake
relationship, but--

36:18.100 --> 36:20.500
- You think that's fake?

36:20.533 --> 36:24.500
- I know the same sh--.
- Teddi sees herself in Erika.

36:24.533 --> 36:26.500
We are affected by people

36:26.533 --> 36:28.767
that have the same issues
that we have,

36:29.000 --> 36:30.767
and we don't like that
in ourselves,

36:31.000 --> 36:32.667
and so we get mad
at that person,

36:32.700 --> 36:35.100
because we see ourselves
in that person.

36:35.133 --> 36:37.066
Are you manipulative?
Is that what you're saying?

36:37.100 --> 36:40.567
- I'm saying I know exactly
what one needs to do

36:40.600 --> 36:42.500
to make people
feel comfortable.

36:42.533 --> 36:44.500
I'm not interested in having
fake relationships with people.

36:44.533 --> 36:45.767
- I don't think you're having
a fake relationship.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.400
- You guys have
your relationship.

36:47.433 --> 36:49.133
I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

36:49.166 --> 36:52.000
- You need to have empathy
for her, because you are her.

36:52.033 --> 36:54.667
From where you two come from,
you have to--

36:54.700 --> 36:58.100
- We have similarities, but the
second that she becomes better

36:58.133 --> 37:01.367
than everybody else,
I say (BLEEP) you.

37:01.400 --> 37:04.133
- Teddi wants the approval
from Erika so she can go,

37:04.166 --> 37:06.433
"Ah. I feel good.
Everything's okay."

37:06.467 --> 37:08.000
But that won't fix it.

37:08.033 --> 37:10.333
- I really am not interested
to get to know

37:10.367 --> 37:12.667
somebody who's not interested
in telling me the truth.

37:12.700 --> 37:16.433
- Here's the thing. Sometimes
life is ----ing uncomfortable.

37:16.467 --> 37:18.133
- I want life to be...

37:18.166 --> 37:20.400
- I know, but it's not.
Life is not perfect.

37:20.433 --> 37:24.567
- And then when I see things
going uncomfortably--

37:24.600 --> 37:26.500
- Teddi, you can't
fix everything.

37:26.533 --> 37:28.533
- I just hate it.
- 'Cause it makes you feel

37:28.567 --> 37:31.567
out of control and very unsafe.
- Yeah, I know.

37:31.600 --> 37:34.166

42:49.367 --> 42:53.066
Ugh.

42:53.100 --> 42:54.700
I'm so hungry.

42:54.734 --> 42:56.467
- No, you're not hungry.
You're not even ----ing hungry.

42:56.500 --> 42:59.066
Get down. Go to ----ing sleep.

42:59.100 --> 43:00.333
- No.
- You've got to go to bed.

43:00.367 --> 43:02.033
You've got to go to bed.
- No, I can't.

43:02.066 --> 43:03.133
I'm very busy.
- You've got to go to bed.

43:03.166 --> 43:05.700
Don't move.
- Okay.

43:05.734 --> 43:07.333
[laughs]

43:07.367 --> 43:09.133
- Lay down!

43:09.166 --> 43:10.767
- [laughs] I don't think I--

43:11.000 --> 43:12.367
- Oh, man.

43:12.400 --> 43:14.000
Are you kidding me?

43:14.033 --> 43:16.467
----ing lay still.
- [laughs]

43:16.500 --> 43:20.033
- Next on "The Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills"...

43:20.066 --> 43:21.367
- How do I--I don't even know
how to hold this.

43:21.400 --> 43:23.100
If anybody's mad at me,

43:23.133 --> 43:26.066
please point
these in the other direction.

43:26.100 --> 43:27.467
- You don't think
she has fun with us?

43:27.500 --> 43:29.200
You don't think she wants
to be here with us?

43:29.233 --> 43:31.033
- But did I say
that last night?

43:31.066 --> 43:33.500
- Yes, I believe you did.
- Ugh.

43:33.533 --> 43:35.367
- I think you have
to talk to her.

43:35.400 --> 43:37.000
- I wanted to start
by apologizing.

43:37.033 --> 43:39.266
Sometimes when you seem,
like, irritated,

43:39.300 --> 43:40.467
I think then I take it on.

43:40.500 --> 43:43.266
- Who is this Teddi?

43:43.300 --> 43:45.233
- Camille's house burned down.

43:45.266 --> 43:47.166
- Wow.
- She's gonna probably come out

43:47.200 --> 43:48.767
of this
being a much nicer girl.

43:49.000 --> 43:51.133
- Yeah, maybe.

43:51.166 --> 43:53.467
- You know that you said a few
things about Dorit, and you--

43:53.500 --> 43:55.133
- Oh, yeah,
I've said some things.

43:55.166 --> 43:57.000
I didn't trust you.

43:57.033 --> 43:58.100
I didn't know where you were
getting all this money from.

43:58.133 --> 43:59.400
- What are you talking about?

43:59.433 --> 44:01.467
- People want to know
what I know.

44:02.433 --> 44:04.300
- To learn more
about the housewives,

44:04.333 --> 44:06.100
