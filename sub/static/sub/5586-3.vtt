00:02.741 --> 00:04.482
MAN [on tape]: While Betty
kept the fat man occupied,

00:04.569 --> 00:06.441
I ducked down the hallway
to his office.

00:06.528 --> 00:07.964
If I found his phone records,

00:08.051 --> 00:09.922
they would prove
that he was the one

00:10.010 --> 00:12.273
who called the police station
on the night of the murder.

00:12.360 --> 00:15.232
All I knew was, the next person through that door

00:15.319 --> 00:17.278
would be the man
who killed my partner.

00:17.365 --> 00:18.583
"Hello, McKendrick,"

00:18.670 --> 00:20.194
I heard from behind me.

00:20.281 --> 00:22.370
I spun around,
but standing there was...

00:22.457 --> 00:24.589
REESE [on tape]:
A stupid housewife

00:24.676 --> 00:26.635
who wouldn't let her son
buy nunchuks

00:26.722 --> 00:28.376
even though
they're totally safe.

00:28.463 --> 00:29.812

All right, Reese, you're busted.

01:19.296 --> 01:20.645
Of all the stupid...

01:20.732 --> 01:22.691
Come on, front and center.

01:26.129 --> 01:28.740
Now, don't blame yourself.

01:28.827 --> 01:31.265
Dewey, you were smoking?

01:31.352 --> 01:32.831
Do you have any idea

01:32.918 --> 01:35.269
what a dangerous, disgusting
addiction that is?

01:35.356 --> 01:37.097
It took me years to quit!

01:37.184 --> 01:38.315
Do you want to end up

01:38.402 --> 01:39.621
breathing through a hole
in your neck?

01:39.708 --> 01:40.622
Do you think that's cool?

01:40.709 --> 01:41.797
You can breathe

01:41.884 --> 01:43.494
through a hole
in your neck?

01:43.581 --> 01:44.800
Whatta you think your mother's
gonna say about this?

01:44.887 --> 01:46.323
You can't tell Mom!
She'll kill me!

01:46.410 --> 01:47.672
Well, you should've thought
of that earlier.

01:47.759 --> 01:49.674
Where would you even get
cigarettes anyway?

01:49.761 --> 01:51.850
There's, like, 20 cartons
hidden in your shop vac.

01:51.937 --> 01:55.811
Oh, my God. That is my stash
from ten years ago.

01:55.898 --> 01:58.814
Lois would kill me if...

01:59.989 --> 02:02.296
All right, Dewey,
under the circumstances,

02:02.383 --> 02:05.081
I am giving you
your one free pass.

02:05.168 --> 02:06.561
-Free pass?
-That's right.

02:06.648 --> 02:08.693
I have given each
of your brothers
one free pass,

02:08.780 --> 02:12.001
one time that I didn't
tell your mother about
something they did.

02:12.088 --> 02:15.570
All right, Francis,
this is your one free pass!

02:18.703 --> 02:21.706
Okay, Reese,
but this is your one!

02:25.275 --> 02:27.669
Okay, Malcolm,

02:27.756 --> 02:30.324
this is your one!

02:30.411 --> 02:32.891
-Please make this
my one free pass.
-All right.

02:32.978 --> 02:35.894
We've got some
paperwork to sign.

02:35.981 --> 02:36.895
LOIS: Chair.

02:36.982 --> 02:38.375
Book.

02:38.462 --> 02:39.594
Window.

02:39.681 --> 02:40.595
Mama.

02:40.682 --> 02:41.770
Come on, Jamie,

02:41.857 --> 02:44.425
you can talk--
just one word.

02:44.512 --> 02:47.297
Hal, has Jamie
said anything in
front of you yet?

02:47.384 --> 02:49.343
Whatever he said,
he's a liar, Lois!

02:49.430 --> 02:50.518
He hasn't seen anything.

02:50.605 --> 02:51.823
What are you talking about?

02:51.910 --> 02:54.217
What are you
talking about?

02:54.304 --> 02:56.176
I'm worried about Jamie.

02:56.263 --> 02:58.656
He's... however old
he is, and he hasn't
said a word yet.

02:58.743 --> 03:01.006
I thought that's what
we liked about him.

03:01.093 --> 03:03.748
You know, it's probably
his filthy ears.

03:03.835 --> 03:06.273
I bet he's all plugged up with
wax and he can't hear anything.

03:06.360 --> 03:07.709
I don't think so.

03:07.796 --> 03:10.102
Relax, honey.
Kids go at their own pace.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.322
Heck, in sixth grade,
I had a full beard,

03:12.409 --> 03:15.325
and I still couldn't
tie my shoes properly.

03:18.067 --> 03:19.634
There you are.

03:19.721 --> 03:21.723
Stevie, you ran off
without your backup inhaler.

03:21.810 --> 03:24.421
Thanks... Dad.

03:24.508 --> 03:26.728
Did Stevie tell you
his big news?

03:26.815 --> 03:27.685
No. What's going on?

03:27.772 --> 03:28.773
Stevie's been accepted

03:28.860 --> 03:30.122
as a research subject

03:30.210 --> 03:32.429
at the Norvet
Biomedical Institute.

03:32.516 --> 03:33.996
Dr. Norvet himself

03:34.083 --> 03:36.607
picked him for the
motor-neuropathy program.

03:36.694 --> 03:39.001
It's... nothing.

03:39.088 --> 03:40.785
Nothing? Come on, Stevie.

03:40.872 --> 03:42.570
This is the most exciting
thing that's happened to us

03:42.657 --> 03:44.702
since they put your
stomach on the inside.

03:44.789 --> 03:46.443
Who knows?

03:46.530 --> 03:49.054
This Christmas might just be
our first ski vacation.

03:49.141 --> 03:50.447
-Dad...
-Tomorrow, after school

03:50.534 --> 03:51.883
we'll go look
at snowboards.

03:51.970 --> 03:52.928
Dad...

03:53.015 --> 03:55.235
I said just look.

04:01.545 --> 04:02.459
My desk!

04:02.546 --> 04:04.026
Reese! What's your problem?

04:04.113 --> 04:05.549
He's my problem.

04:05.636 --> 04:07.551
I get to come home
to my own room

04:07.638 --> 04:10.206
and put my own stuff
on my own desk.

04:10.293 --> 04:11.729
There's such a thing
as manners, Stevie.

04:11.816 --> 04:13.601
When you're a guest
in someone's house...

04:13.688 --> 04:14.993
[shrieks]

04:20.346 --> 04:21.738
Real classy, Reese.

04:21.826 --> 04:23.654
-Go ahead, hit him.
-It's not fair!

04:23.741 --> 04:25.439
He's hit me plenty of times.

04:25.526 --> 04:27.354
He makes fun of me,
he treats me like crap,

04:27.441 --> 04:29.878
and just because he's in that
chair, he gets away with it!

04:29.965 --> 04:33.316
I blame... society.

04:36.232 --> 04:37.973
-Sorry, Stevie.
-Good.

04:38.060 --> 04:40.062
LOIS: Malcolm, get your dirty
socks off this table

04:40.149 --> 04:41.498
or I'll feed them
to you for dinner!

04:41.585 --> 04:43.239
Like I'd taste a difference.

04:48.462 --> 04:50.420
I'm gonna do it anyway.

04:50.507 --> 04:51.508
What?

04:51.595 --> 04:53.118
I'm gonna beat you up anyway.

04:53.205 --> 04:54.468
This Friday after school,

04:54.555 --> 04:56.252
we're gonna go somewhere private

04:56.339 --> 04:58.167
and I'm gonna beat you so bad

04:58.254 --> 04:59.734
your wheelchair's gonna
need a wheelchair.

04:59.821 --> 05:02.214
I want you to think
about that for a few days.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.739
Picture it.
Dream about it,

05:04.826 --> 05:06.131
like I'm doing.

05:06.218 --> 05:07.916
Even if you tell
on me, I will find

05:08.003 --> 05:10.048
some way to make this happen.

05:10.135 --> 05:11.702
So you might as well
have some dignity

05:11.789 --> 05:13.400
and keep your mouth shut.

05:14.705 --> 05:16.707
Your ass might not know
I'm kicking it,

05:16.794 --> 05:18.361
but I will.

05:19.493 --> 05:21.364
Here you go.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.063
All right, Jamie.

05:25.150 --> 05:27.370
The doctor said there's no
physical reason you can't talk,

05:27.457 --> 05:28.893
so that's exactly
what you are going to do.

05:28.980 --> 05:30.330
Talk.

05:30.417 --> 05:31.940
He said the best way
to get you started

05:32.027 --> 05:33.550
is for me to talk
to you constantly

05:33.637 --> 05:34.986
about everything
happening around you

05:35.073 --> 05:36.858
so that you live
in a more verbal world.

05:36.945 --> 05:38.381
That means Mommy's
going to narrate

05:38.468 --> 05:39.904
everything she's doing--
like right now

05:39.991 --> 05:41.819
when she's going over here
to make you a snack.

05:41.906 --> 05:44.126
Then it'll be time to
do the laundry, and after that

05:44.213 --> 05:46.607
she gets to make dinner
for the whole family,

05:46.694 --> 05:48.217
who will wolf it down
in ten seconds

05:48.304 --> 05:50.393
and leave her
to do the dishes by herself

05:50.480 --> 05:51.960
before she gets to make
the boys' lunches for school
the next day.

05:52.047 --> 05:53.875
Then she'll get ready for bed
after everybody else

05:53.962 --> 05:56.007
and discover that the bathroom

05:56.094 --> 05:58.009
is a swampy, hairy mess
and Mommy gets to spend

05:58.096 --> 06:00.577
her last waking minutes with
a sponge and a can of cleanser.

06:00.664 --> 06:01.926
Then it'll be time
to wake up in the morning

06:02.013 --> 06:03.667
and she'll do it all over again.

06:03.754 --> 06:05.582
Day after day, week after week,
for the next 30 years

06:05.669 --> 06:07.236
until Mommy dies,
and then with Mommy's luck,

06:07.323 --> 06:08.368
even that won't be
the end of it.

06:14.199 --> 06:16.201
Dewey! Get out here right now.

06:16.288 --> 06:17.638
You're smoking again

06:17.725 --> 06:19.596
after we talked
about this last week?

06:19.683 --> 06:21.293
You know what that does to you.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.034
I'm cutting back.

06:23.121 --> 06:24.427
Cutting back?

06:24.514 --> 06:25.950
How many cigarettes
are you smoking?

06:26.037 --> 06:27.082
Under two packs a day.

06:28.910 --> 06:29.867
What?!

06:29.954 --> 06:31.652
How is that even possible?

06:31.739 --> 06:33.567
I got rid of the cartons
in the garage.

06:33.654 --> 06:35.569
Well, you didn't get rid of the
ones hidden in the crawlspace.

06:35.656 --> 06:38.093
Or the rain gutters,
or under the ivy.

06:38.180 --> 06:40.356
There's thousands of cigarettes
hidden all over the place.

06:40.443 --> 06:42.663
How could you spend all that
money and not even smoke them?

06:42.750 --> 06:44.665
I could have gone
to private school.

06:44.752 --> 06:48.016
Keep it down.

06:48.103 --> 06:49.887
Look, Dewey, I'm sorry,

06:49.974 --> 06:51.454
but I had such
a hard time quitting.

06:51.541 --> 06:53.325
The only way I could do it
without freaking out

06:53.413 --> 06:56.024
was knowing they were there.

06:56.111 --> 06:58.026
I know it sounds crazy.

06:58.113 --> 06:59.375
I'll tell you what's crazy.

06:59.462 --> 07:01.203
Being hooked
on these stupid things

07:01.290 --> 07:03.335
even though I hate
the way they taste and smell.

07:03.423 --> 07:04.815
Well, those are really stale.

07:04.902 --> 07:06.600
You're not getting
the fresh, rich flavor--

07:06.687 --> 07:08.384
Never mind!

07:08.471 --> 07:10.952
The point is, you can beat this.
We'll do it together.

07:11.039 --> 07:13.345
Listen, you know how much
I love coffee, right?

07:13.433 --> 07:15.478
Yeah, I've seen you
drink it in the shower.

07:15.565 --> 07:16.827
Exactly.

07:16.914 --> 07:18.568
I must drink
three pots a day, easy.

07:18.655 --> 07:20.701
Well, I'm willing to give
it up for you, cold turkey,

07:20.788 --> 07:21.963
if you give up smoking.

07:22.050 --> 07:23.791
-Really?
-Absolutely.

07:23.878 --> 07:25.445
That way we're both suffering.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.316
We both know what
the other's going through

07:27.403 --> 07:29.579
and we can support each other.

07:29.666 --> 07:32.539
You and me, Dewey.
We'll be a team, huh?

07:32.626 --> 07:34.454
That sounds great, Dad.

07:34.541 --> 07:35.803
Just let me have

07:35.890 --> 07:37.413
one more to get it
out of my system.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.458
-We can start--
-Dewey.

07:38.545 --> 07:39.763
Yeah, all right.

07:43.245 --> 07:45.813
Come on, Stevie, pay attention.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.423
You just had Hitler
invade Malibu.

07:47.510 --> 07:48.903
Sorry.

07:48.990 --> 07:50.644
What's up with you lately?

07:50.731 --> 07:52.167
Hi, guys.

07:52.254 --> 07:53.298
Hey, Reese, how'd it go
with the principal?

07:53.385 --> 07:54.822
Fantastic.
I love when they get old

07:54.909 --> 07:56.606
and they start
just phoning it in.

07:56.693 --> 07:58.347
He's actually
willing to believe

07:58.434 --> 08:00.131
this is from
obsessive hand washing.

08:00.218 --> 08:01.219
[chuckles]

08:01.306 --> 08:02.482
[whispering]:
Friday!

08:03.700 --> 08:05.267
Reese took out
Scotty Riselli today.

08:05.354 --> 08:07.182
It was brutal.
You should have seen it.

08:07.269 --> 08:09.358
-[whimpers]
-He hit him so hard, a few times

08:09.445 --> 08:11.099
he actually lifted him
up in the air.

08:11.186 --> 08:14.015
And the blood was--
I mean, there's always blood,

08:14.102 --> 08:17.148
but Scotty was like one of those
big sprinklers, you know?

08:17.235 --> 08:18.236
Choo, choo, choo...

08:18.323 --> 08:19.324
And once he went down,

08:19.411 --> 08:20.935
Reese went to work on him.

08:21.022 --> 08:24.112
Did you know
he had dental tools?

08:24.199 --> 08:26.070
Hey, I get Africa.

08:26.157 --> 08:28.595
Can I...

08:28.682 --> 08:30.248
ask you something?

08:30.335 --> 08:32.990
-Sure.
-Do you find...

08:33.077 --> 08:34.991
my personality...

08:35.078 --> 08:36.558
abrasive?

08:36.645 --> 08:39.431
-What?
-Do you think...

08:39.519 --> 08:41.477
I'm needlessly...

08:41.563 --> 08:43.131
antagonistic?

08:43.217 --> 08:45.046
I don't know.
Probably.

08:45.133 --> 08:46.308
What do you care?

08:46.395 --> 08:48.484
I don't...

08:48.571 --> 08:50.530
want anyone...

08:50.617 --> 08:52.662
to hate me.

08:52.749 --> 08:55.752
It's Lisa Filmore, isn't it?

08:55.839 --> 08:56.753
Who?

08:56.840 --> 08:58.363
I saw you
checking her out.

08:58.450 --> 09:00.670
You like the big
stuff, huh? Nice.

09:00.757 --> 09:03.151
Little jiggly-wiggly, little
wabbal-abbal-abbal-abbal...

09:03.238 --> 09:05.240
You're... a jerk.

09:05.327 --> 09:07.590
I'm just being supportive!
I'm sorry!

09:07.677 --> 09:09.026
Come on, let's just
finish the game.

09:09.113 --> 09:10.767
Can't.

09:10.854 --> 09:12.813
Today's our...

09:12.900 --> 09:14.989
first meeting...

09:15.076 --> 09:16.904
at the Norvet Institute.

09:16.991 --> 09:18.470
Okay, wait.

09:18.558 --> 09:19.602
There's something good
about your personality.

09:19.689 --> 09:21.082
You completely
humor your dad

09:21.169 --> 09:22.518
with all his idiotic
plans for you to walk,

09:22.605 --> 09:24.694
no matter how pointless
and stupid it is to try.

09:24.781 --> 09:26.609
You're never, like,
"Dad, wake up.

09:26.696 --> 09:28.045
"I'm never getting out
of this wheelchair.

09:28.132 --> 09:29.873
I'm going to be a cripple
till the day I die."

09:29.960 --> 09:31.962
I mean, you know it, but you
don't throw it in his face.

09:32.049 --> 09:33.964
That's a really nice quality.

09:34.051 --> 09:35.052
There, better?

09:37.011 --> 09:38.621
LOIS: And so I spend all
this time every morning

09:38.708 --> 09:40.492
on my hair,
trying to get it just so,

09:40.580 --> 09:41.972
although I know
no one else notices.

09:42.059 --> 09:43.539
It's such a stupid vanity thing.

09:43.626 --> 09:45.846
I don't know why I'm
so neurotic about my hair.

09:45.933 --> 09:47.630
You know, it's just ridiculous,
if you think about it.

09:47.717 --> 09:49.023
Wish I could
let it go,

09:49.110 --> 09:50.502
but it's like I just
can't help myself.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.635
[Hal sniffing, sighing]

09:54.158 --> 09:55.856
Slow down.
You haven't had breakfast yet.

09:55.943 --> 09:58.685
Well, if you got me the nicotine
gum like I asked, then--

09:58.772 --> 10:00.077
[coughing]

10:01.644 --> 10:04.560
[hacking]

10:06.867 --> 10:08.042
You okay?

10:08.129 --> 10:09.957
Oh, that?
That's nothing, Lois.

10:10.044 --> 10:11.785
That's just...
puberty.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.351
You know,
when a boy's lungs drop.

10:13.438 --> 10:15.702
This is how it hits all
the men in my family.

10:15.789 --> 10:18.966
Hacking cough, dark
circles under the eyes,

10:19.053 --> 10:20.271
yellowing fingers...

10:26.974 --> 10:28.366
So there I am, 13 years old,

10:28.453 --> 10:30.281
flat-chested as I can be,

10:30.368 --> 10:31.805
everyone around me is sprouting,

10:31.892 --> 10:33.937
and I'm feeling just horrible
about myself.

10:34.024 --> 10:35.547
And why?

10:35.635 --> 10:37.288
No reason at all.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.595
I'm getting straight A's,
I'm running the food drive,

10:39.682 --> 10:41.249
I'm all-county
on the gymnastics team,

10:41.336 --> 10:42.816
and none of this means
anything to me

10:42.903 --> 10:45.732
because I'm so fixated
on my bust line.

10:47.603 --> 10:48.865
And so, like an idiot,

10:48.952 --> 10:52.434
I started stuffing my bra
with toilet paper.

10:52.521 --> 10:53.783
Even after all these years,

10:53.870 --> 10:56.264
I remember every morning
in the bathroom,

10:56.351 --> 10:57.961
shoving these things
down my shirt

10:58.048 --> 11:01.965
and feeling like such
an awkward, ugly, little girl.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.579
Thank you.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.452
Of course,
in second-period Spanish,

11:10.539 --> 11:12.802
I had to sit next to the
snooty Janice Montgomery

11:12.889 --> 11:15.500
with her tangerine nail polish,
which I was dying to try,

11:15.587 --> 11:17.067
but of course
she wouldn't let me

11:17.154 --> 11:19.200
-because I had drugstore shoes.
-[door opens]

11:19.287 --> 11:20.331
Hey, Mom.

11:20.418 --> 11:22.682
Look at these stains.

11:22.769 --> 11:24.988
You boys are in so much trouble.

11:25.075 --> 11:26.773
No more pillowcases for a month.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.558
Okay.

12:02.809 --> 12:05.855
Fixing something?

12:05.942 --> 12:07.204
Dad.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.554
Hi.

12:09.641 --> 12:12.079
I'm so disappointed
in you, son.

12:12.166 --> 12:13.297
We had an agreement.

12:13.384 --> 12:14.734
[gurgling]

12:14.821 --> 12:16.126
What was that?

12:16.213 --> 12:17.780
What was what?

12:17.867 --> 12:19.347
[gurgling]

12:21.392 --> 12:23.743
All right,
we both have a problem.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.788
This is so degrading.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.921
On the way home from school,
I almost pulled a cigarette butt

12:28.008 --> 12:29.183
out of the gutter.

12:29.270 --> 12:30.967
I French-kissed
your mother this morning

12:31.054 --> 12:32.926
just to lick the coffee
off her teeth.

12:33.013 --> 12:35.058
But we can do this;
we just need

12:35.145 --> 12:36.625
to find a way
to divert our minds

12:36.712 --> 12:39.019
when the pangs get too bad.

12:39.106 --> 12:42.413
[thwacking]

12:42.500 --> 12:43.937
[thwack]

12:46.243 --> 12:49.290
Hal, what are you doing?

12:49.377 --> 12:51.118
What's it look like I'm doing?

12:51.205 --> 12:53.947
Can't a father have a friendly
game of catch with his son?!

12:54.034 --> 12:55.078
We're having fun!

12:56.601 --> 12:58.603
[sighs]

13:02.738 --> 13:05.132
I had that dream again
last night.

13:05.219 --> 13:07.221
Cheerleading tryouts.

13:07.308 --> 13:09.397
Like it wasn't bad enough
it happened,

13:09.484 --> 13:11.878
I have to relive it
for the rest of my life.

13:11.965 --> 13:15.925
I was so excited to think
that I might be a Cougar,

13:16.012 --> 13:17.797
and finally feel like
I belonged.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.146
The routine was nothing,

13:19.233 --> 13:20.930
I'd done that stuff
in gymnastics for years.

13:21.017 --> 13:22.889
And still, I practiced
that routine for weeks,

13:22.976 --> 13:25.717
making sure that it was perfect.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.067
On the day of the tryouts,

13:27.154 --> 13:29.025
I borrowed my sister's
good sweater,

13:29.112 --> 13:31.462
spent about an hour on my hair,
stuffed my bra--

13:31.549 --> 13:34.248
I even shoved a little extra
in there for luck.

13:34.335 --> 13:36.641
And when I got down to the gym,
I found out I had to go first,

13:36.728 --> 13:38.034
in front of the whole squad

13:38.121 --> 13:39.731
and everyone else
who was trying out.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.996
So I just pretended
to be braver than I was.

13:43.083 --> 13:44.693
I smiled real big,
and I went out there

13:44.780 --> 13:46.347
and I started my routine.

13:46.434 --> 13:49.524
I did a round-off,
a cartwheel, a kip-up,

13:49.611 --> 13:52.266
it was going great,
I was so happy.

13:52.353 --> 13:55.530
I landed my back-flip
dead solid perfect.

13:55.617 --> 13:56.923
I threw up my arms,

13:57.010 --> 13:58.881
and instead of
everybody cheering...

13:58.968 --> 14:02.929
everybody was laughing.

14:03.016 --> 14:04.626
And I looked down,

14:04.713 --> 14:07.716
and there was a 30-foot-long
trail of toilet paper

14:07.803 --> 14:10.980
along the tumbling mat.

14:11.067 --> 14:13.330
Everything I worked for,

14:13.417 --> 14:16.029
everything I wanted
so desperately...

14:16.116 --> 14:21.034
ruined because of my vanity.

14:23.427 --> 14:26.126
And you know what
the worst part is?

14:26.213 --> 14:28.693
I didn't even learn anything.

14:28.780 --> 14:32.480
Deep down, I'm still
just as shallow as I was then.

14:32.567 --> 14:37.050
All that fussing and primping
and time I wasted

14:37.137 --> 14:38.790
to shut out laughter
that stopped 30 years ago.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.618
It's disgusting.

14:40.705 --> 14:44.187
If I had any guts, I would just
cut off my hair right now.

14:44.274 --> 14:46.711
You know, just face it down,
and beat it!

14:46.798 --> 14:50.280
[telephone rings]

14:52.630 --> 14:55.068
[ringing continues]

14:55.155 --> 14:56.286
You gonna get that?

14:56.373 --> 14:59.072
I can't.

14:59.159 --> 15:00.769
-Hello?
-Malcolm...

15:00.856 --> 15:02.292
It's Abe.
Where's your brother?

15:02.379 --> 15:03.772
Reese? I don't know.

15:03.859 --> 15:05.078
Probably pounding the snot
out of someone.

15:05.165 --> 15:06.557
It's Stevie!
You've got to stop it!

15:06.644 --> 15:08.124
What? What are you
talking about?

15:08.211 --> 15:09.473
Stevie and I were
in the middle of our session

15:09.560 --> 15:11.388
at the Norvet Institute,

15:11.475 --> 15:14.522
and then he said he had to go
fight Reese, and just took off!

15:14.609 --> 15:15.915
-I'm terrified that--
-Oh, no.

15:23.357 --> 15:25.141
Reese, what are you doing?

15:25.228 --> 15:28.014
Something I should've done
years ago.

15:28.101 --> 15:30.190
I've been numbing my legs
in ice for an hour now.

15:30.277 --> 15:32.061
-What?
-I can't feel a thing
down there.

15:33.541 --> 15:35.412
See? Nothing.

15:35.499 --> 15:37.849
The first three times I did
that, it hurt like hell.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.635
Nobody's gonna say
this wasn't a fair fight.

15:40.722 --> 15:42.028
When Stevie gets here,

15:42.115 --> 15:43.681
I'm gonna flop over to him
like a fish,

15:43.768 --> 15:45.335
yank him out of his chair,

15:45.422 --> 15:48.730
and smash his face in,
gimp-to-gimp.

15:50.688 --> 15:52.516
Reese, you're insane!

15:52.603 --> 15:53.996
Am I?

15:54.083 --> 15:55.955
They thought Einstein
was crazy...

15:56.042 --> 15:58.305
until he started kicking ass.

15:58.392 --> 16:00.785
[thud]

16:00.872 --> 16:02.222
[gagging]

16:02.309 --> 16:03.963
Hey. Where's Mom?

16:04.050 --> 16:06.835
She's locked in her room
with Jamie.

16:06.922 --> 16:08.271
She's been in there
for hours.

16:08.358 --> 16:10.665
Oh. Listen, I'm sorry
I snapped at you.

16:10.752 --> 16:11.883
I was just agitated,

16:11.971 --> 16:13.276
but I'm feeling
better now.

16:13.363 --> 16:14.582
Hey, I really think
we're over the hump.

16:14.669 --> 16:16.366
We're still a team, okay?

16:16.453 --> 16:17.759
Good boy.

16:29.118 --> 16:30.250
What are you doing?!

16:30.337 --> 16:31.381
What?

16:31.468 --> 16:32.600
Oh, this.
It's nothing.

16:32.687 --> 16:33.993
It's keeping me calm.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.343
-But we're quitting!
-No, I'm quitting coffee.

16:36.430 --> 16:38.780
-You're quitting cigarettes.
-That's cheating!

16:38.867 --> 16:40.303
You do not get to do this.

16:40.390 --> 16:42.218
Actually, Dewey, I get
to do whatever I want,

16:42.305 --> 16:43.654
because I am a grown-up.

16:43.741 --> 16:46.222
All right,
if that's how you want it.

16:47.397 --> 16:48.746
Dewey!
What are you doing?

16:48.833 --> 16:50.009
Dewey!

16:52.707 --> 16:54.665
Don't you dare!

16:56.972 --> 16:58.539
Ah...

16:58.626 --> 17:02.021
The smooth, wonderful taste
of betrayal!

17:02.108 --> 17:03.718
Oh, yeah?

17:03.805 --> 17:06.329
Well, I'm in flavor
country, baby!

17:06.415 --> 17:09.593
-Mmm!
-[coffee swishing]

17:13.162 --> 17:15.034
This is good.
This is growth.

17:15.121 --> 17:16.078
Just do it.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.471
Don't be such a chicken.

17:17.558 --> 17:19.255
It's the only way
to stop hearing it.

17:19.342 --> 17:21.083
All those kids laughing,

17:21.170 --> 17:22.650
my mother coming in
to the nurse's office

17:22.737 --> 17:23.954
telling me to stop blubbering,

17:24.042 --> 17:25.348
she wouldn't have
to stuff my bra

17:25.435 --> 17:27.959
if I wasn't too lazy
to grow them myself.

17:30.136 --> 17:32.747
Oh, my God.

17:32.834 --> 17:34.531
It was my mother.

17:34.618 --> 17:37.143
She was the one stuffing my bra.

17:37.230 --> 17:39.710
Oh, my God.

17:39.797 --> 17:42.713
She was the one making me feel
so horrible and inadequate.

17:42.800 --> 17:43.801
Not me.

17:43.888 --> 17:45.499
This wasn't about vanity, Jamie.

17:45.586 --> 17:47.240
This is about
an abusive old bat

17:47.327 --> 17:50.373
trying to make her kid
into something that she wasn't.

17:50.460 --> 17:52.071
[sighs]

17:52.158 --> 17:55.552
Well, I am not going to be
that kind of mother.

17:55.639 --> 17:57.641
If you don't feel like
talking yet,

17:57.728 --> 17:59.382
then you don't have to talk.

17:59.469 --> 18:02.559
I'm gonna love you
exactly the way you are.

18:07.738 --> 18:10.176
Shut up.

18:10.263 --> 18:12.700
Mm. Rich, roasted
goodness!

18:12.787 --> 18:15.137
Suddenly I'm at a French cafe.

18:15.224 --> 18:18.009
HAL: Well, I'm with two girls
in a speedboat, sucking down

18:18.097 --> 18:20.882
a smooth blend
of fine tobaccos.

18:20.969 --> 18:22.492
Hal!

18:22.579 --> 18:24.668
Dewey's drinking coffee!

18:31.501 --> 18:34.678
I think crippling my legs
made my arms stronger.

18:34.765 --> 18:36.376
Like how blind guys
have bigger noses.

18:36.463 --> 18:37.812
This is gonna be great.

18:37.899 --> 18:40.162
Reese, you can't do this.
Stevie's our friend.

18:40.249 --> 18:42.164
Hey, he's not my friend.
He's your friend.

18:42.251 --> 18:44.079
He treats me like crap.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.603
He insults me
and disrespects me...

18:46.690 --> 18:48.344
and you let him.

18:48.431 --> 18:49.867
-What?
-You always take his side

18:49.954 --> 18:51.260
and you always do
everything his way,

18:51.347 --> 18:52.870
even though we're brothers.

18:52.957 --> 18:55.873
Wait. Are you jealous?

18:55.960 --> 18:57.832
No, I'm pissed.

18:57.919 --> 18:59.225
You and Stevie

18:59.312 --> 19:01.096
are gonna be friends
your whole life,

19:01.183 --> 19:03.011
but once you go away to college
and you're not stuck with us,

19:03.098 --> 19:04.795
we're never gonna see you again.

19:04.882 --> 19:06.101
But even so,

19:06.188 --> 19:07.407
you're spending the rest
of the time left

19:07.494 --> 19:10.888
with Stevie instead of...

19:13.195 --> 19:15.632
Do I have to tell you
I love you?

19:15.719 --> 19:17.025
No.

19:17.112 --> 19:18.418
Good.

19:20.637 --> 19:24.598
Dude, like you said,
we're brothers.

19:24.685 --> 19:26.513
It doesn't matter if
I don't want to be here,

19:26.600 --> 19:27.818
I'm stuck here.

19:27.905 --> 19:30.430
No matter where I go
or what I do,

19:30.517 --> 19:31.866
we're always going
to be forced together.

19:31.953 --> 19:33.824
Christmas, birthdays...

19:33.911 --> 19:35.652
We're going to be forced
to be around each other

19:35.739 --> 19:37.306
for the rest of our lives.

19:37.393 --> 19:38.220
Really?

19:38.307 --> 19:41.571
[whirring and clanking]

19:41.658 --> 19:42.572
What was that?

19:42.659 --> 19:44.183
I don't know.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.403

19:56.978 --> 20:00.373

20:00.460 --> 20:01.939

20:02.026 --> 20:06.205
You're... mine!

20:07.858 --> 20:08.816
Good news, Stevie.

20:08.903 --> 20:10.034
I forgive you.

20:11.906 --> 20:13.734
Come on, Stevie!
I can't walk.

20:13.821 --> 20:15.083
This isn't fair!

20:15.170 --> 20:17.390
Don't reduce yourself
to my level!

20:17.477 --> 20:19.609
You're better than this!

20:30.925 --> 20:32.405
Oh, God, I'm too late!

20:32.492 --> 20:35.059
Stevie, please stop!
Think of the lawsuit!

20:35.146 --> 20:38.628
You know these people will do
anything to get our money!

20:41.283 --> 20:43.546
The Norvet Institute kicked
Stevie out of their program

20:43.633 --> 20:45.461
for unauthorized use
of their equipment.

20:45.548 --> 20:47.637
And Reese will be okay,
but he's not allowed out of bed

20:47.724 --> 20:50.510
until he stops seeing
four of everything.

21:02.173 --> 21:05.568
Mom's making Dad find every last
one of his old cigarettes.

21:05.655 --> 21:07.570
She's gonna make him eat any
she finds tomorrow morning,

21:07.657 --> 21:09.180
so he's pretty motivated.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.617
The amazing thing is

21:10.704 --> 21:12.445
I'm the only one
that got off scot-free.

21:12.532 --> 21:16.231
Malcolm,
go change Reese's bedpan.

21:16.318 --> 21:18.320
Hey, he's my brother.
