00:23.757 --> 00:27.295
Oh, stupid rain.

00:27.395 --> 00:30.764
Getting everything
so moist.

00:30.864 --> 00:35.136
How I miss Mr. Sun's
silly smiling face.

00:35.236 --> 00:36.737
STARFIRE: Silkie!

00:36.837 --> 00:38.672
Oh, there you are.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.175
Oh, no.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.312
Has falling sky liquid once
again caused you the sadness?

00:48.382 --> 00:50.718
This will not do.

00:50.818 --> 00:53.487
It's fine, Starfire.
Just leave us alone.

00:53.587 --> 00:56.056
-Oh, okay, okay.

00:56.157 --> 00:58.792
I want to be alone
with my sadness.

01:01.329 --> 01:05.199
Come on, I'm trying to mope
so hard, right now.

01:08.402 --> 01:11.372
I actually
feel a lot better.

01:13.141 --> 01:15.743
Girl, you just raised my
happiness level
a whole giga smile.

01:17.478 --> 01:20.848
I feel like I just
ate a whole box of cookies.

01:20.948 --> 01:24.785
That is why proper
distribution of affection
is important.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.521
-Raven!
-Hey, hey!

01:27.621 --> 01:30.358
-You may also
receive the affection.
-Careful.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.626
Why will you not let me
up your cheers?

01:32.726 --> 01:35.463
Because in this box,
are the Twin Destroyers
of Azarath,

01:35.563 --> 01:39.533
harbingers of doom,
purveyors of exquisite misery
and endless pain.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.035
I thought it was the lunch.

01:42.136 --> 01:46.307
I need to collect spell
ingredients to banish these
demons back to Azarath

01:46.407 --> 01:49.610
and I can't take them with me.
Keep an eye on them,
while I'm gone.

01:49.710 --> 01:52.846
Can I trust you all
not to go near them?

01:52.946 --> 01:54.382
-Of course.
-Obviously.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.617
Sit around and
don't do anything? On it.

01:56.717 --> 01:59.253
Hugs and kisses
all the night long.

01:59.353 --> 02:00.421
Yes.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.490
Hugs and kisses don't solve
every problem.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.758
I thought you already
learned that lesson.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.694
Everyone stand back!

02:09.863 --> 02:11.799
Please don't explode.

02:14.768 --> 02:19.640
Not everything in the world
deserves your affection,
especially these creatures.

02:19.740 --> 02:20.741
I understand.

02:20.841 --> 02:22.376
No hugs or kisses,

02:22.476 --> 02:24.812
-only light tummy tickles.
-No.

02:24.912 --> 02:28.316
I see. They can have
the strawberry shakes
after dinner

02:28.416 --> 02:29.683
but no the whipped cream.

02:29.783 --> 02:33.153
-No!
-Surely I can stroke
under the chins.

02:33.254 --> 02:34.822
No tickles! No shakes!

02:34.922 --> 02:36.357
No chin stroking!

02:36.457 --> 02:38.158
They feed on
love and affection.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.494
Give them too much
and we're all going
to have a bad day!

02:40.594 --> 02:42.263
-I have gotten it.

02:42.363 --> 02:45.633
I will not touch
the Twin Destroyers
of Azarath,

02:45.733 --> 02:49.670
no matter how much they
may clearly need affection.

02:49.770 --> 02:50.938
Thank you.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.808
Don't open it!

02:56.277 --> 02:58.379
Seriously though,
don't open it.

03:05.553 --> 03:09.390
Oh, that is the cute noise.

03:09.490 --> 03:13.294
Do you not all feel compelled
to cheer up those
that are sad,

03:13.394 --> 03:14.762
no matter who they are?

03:14.862 --> 03:15.663
-Nope.
-Eh.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.665
Depends. How cute is she?

03:19.300 --> 03:21.469
I cannot help it!

03:21.569 --> 03:23.704
I must give the hugs.

03:23.804 --> 03:26.507
-Starfire, no!

03:26.607 --> 03:28.842
Just one snuggle!

03:33.514 --> 03:34.615
Starfire!

03:34.715 --> 03:38.619
The Twin Destroyers
are adorable!

03:38.719 --> 03:40.454
Hello, new friends!

03:40.554 --> 03:41.789
Uh, hello.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.325
Thank you for not sending
us back to Azarath.

03:45.893 --> 03:48.396
Here there is love and
happiness in new faces.

03:48.496 --> 03:50.431
Oh, that is most kind.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.500
Your faces are also nice.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.402
Raven said
not to touch them, Star.

03:54.502 --> 03:56.537
But, they are so cute.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.475
That sure was fun.

04:34.575 --> 04:36.276
Get back in the box!

04:36.377 --> 04:38.446
-Don't give me the eyes.

04:38.546 --> 04:39.613
You heard me.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.782
Robin, what are you doing?

04:41.882 --> 04:43.751
It's called tough love, Star.

04:43.851 --> 04:47.287
Remember, these guys
feed on affection.

04:49.423 --> 04:53.293
Because, they
like all creatures
thirst for it.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.829
But tonight, their throats
will be parched.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.698
Back in the box!

05:06.740 --> 05:09.042
Just one goodbye kiss.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.084
What did you do?

05:23.591 --> 05:25.993
Oh, an egg. That's not so bad.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.629
Raven's back!

05:28.729 --> 05:30.864
What are we going to do?

05:30.964 --> 05:32.833
I got this!

05:32.933 --> 05:34.602
Way to think
on your feet, Beast Boy.

05:34.702 --> 05:35.936
Now quick, act natural.

05:37.471 --> 05:38.839
You opened the box,
didn't you?

05:38.939 --> 05:40.641
What...
Why would you...

05:40.741 --> 05:43.411
-Of course not.
-Yes, that is correct.

05:43.511 --> 05:46.947
-Well, we're doomed.
-No, we are not the doomed.

05:47.047 --> 05:50.918
I gave them so much
love, they became
the harmless egg.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.922
The egg is hatching!

06:08.135 --> 06:11.004
Your love turned them into
a monster, Starfire.

06:11.104 --> 06:13.006
Can't you just
banish 'em, Rave?

06:13.106 --> 06:15.909
No, only the one who
empowered them with love
can defeat them.

06:17.511 --> 06:20.481
Starfire, you're going to have
to be mean to them.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.583
But, I cannot!

06:22.683 --> 06:25.085
Then we're going to have
to do this old school.

06:25.185 --> 06:26.887
CYBORG: Titan Robot, assemble!

06:33.193 --> 06:34.928
Left leg, power on.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.799
Left arm, power on!

06:40.133 --> 06:42.570
Right arm, power on!

06:42.670 --> 06:45.138
Right leg, power on!

06:46.073 --> 06:47.941
Head, power on!

06:48.609 --> 06:50.177
Titan Robot, go!

07:18.806 --> 07:19.940
All right, Titans,
let's do this!

07:20.040 --> 07:22.710
Right arm, left arm.
Sonic combo!

07:31.585 --> 07:34.788
CYBORG: Left leg!
Blazing leg saber!

07:44.264 --> 07:45.599
Let's finish them off!

07:45.699 --> 07:47.768
Right leg, hammer kick!

07:57.144 --> 07:59.880
STARFIRE: There, there,
formerly tiny people.

07:59.980 --> 08:03.050
Surely you only rampage
because you are scared.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.886
Starfire, you're only
making it stronger.

08:33.346 --> 08:37.150
My distributions
of affection have
ruined everything.

08:37.250 --> 08:40.520
I suppose not everybody
deserves the love.

08:40.621 --> 08:43.156
We're trapped in here, Star.
You're our only hope!

08:43.256 --> 08:46.093
For the sake of the
world, can you be mean
to that thing?

08:46.193 --> 08:47.661
I can try.

08:48.796 --> 08:51.899
Twin Destroyers,
you may be big

08:51.999 --> 08:55.936
but you are also so very cute.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.806
Even her insults
are compliments.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.641
Mean might have been
a stretch.

09:00.741 --> 09:02.743
Can you handle
aloof, Starfire?

09:02.843 --> 09:03.811
Aloof?

09:03.911 --> 09:05.112
Just turn away from it.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.080
Cross your arms and tilt
your head up!

09:07.180 --> 09:08.248
Ah, yes!

09:08.348 --> 09:10.884
Yes, like you do all the time.

09:10.984 --> 09:12.953
Yeah, like I do all the time.

09:16.156 --> 09:19.092
What's the matter?
Do you not like us anymore?

09:19.192 --> 09:21.561
No, I do not!

09:21.662 --> 09:23.864
You are the butt.

09:25.198 --> 09:28.602
The butt and you smell
like celery.

09:28.702 --> 09:29.937
Oh, snap!

09:30.037 --> 09:32.105
Your mother has
the weight problems

09:33.874 --> 09:37.678
so severely that the doctors
comment she should eat more
of the fruits and vegetables.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.579
She brought mamas into it!

09:39.680 --> 09:41.581
She brought mamas into it!

09:41.682 --> 09:43.684
I do not like you!

09:43.784 --> 09:45.585
My feelings!

09:45.686 --> 09:47.287
It's working. Keep it up!

09:47.387 --> 09:49.857
Um, your kerpoffin

09:49.957 --> 09:54.161
is like glorvek on
a barkinesta!

09:54.261 --> 09:57.164
ALL: Oh!

10:02.736 --> 10:05.706
That was mean. How could you?

10:05.806 --> 10:07.808
I do not wish to hear it.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.743
Back in the box!

10:12.279 --> 10:15.282
Girl, I did not know
you could be so cold.

10:15.382 --> 10:16.616
I'm proud of you, Starfire.

10:16.717 --> 10:19.619
I know being such
a horrible person must
have been tough on you.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.021
Thank you, Raven.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.792
I could not have been
so cruel without your help.

10:24.892 --> 10:27.928
We will always remember your
sweet kisses.

10:28.028 --> 10:31.064
Oh, and they
will remember you.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.767
ALL: No!
