WEBVTT

00:01.935 --> 00:04.569
Well, this is so depressing.

00:04.638 --> 00:06.649
What are you talking about?
It's Central Park.

00:06.673 --> 00:08.306
A-All these cute little boats...

00:08.375 --> 00:10.386
Yeah, and it's a beautiful day,
but the only reason we're here

00:10.410 --> 00:12.210
is 'cause a dead body was found.

00:12.279 --> 00:13.845
You need a vacation, Reagan.

00:13.914 --> 00:15.224
Probably find
a dead body there, too.

00:15.248 --> 00:16.848
Good morning, Detectives.

00:16.917 --> 00:19.183
- Not according to him.
- Uh...

00:19.252 --> 00:20.086
What do we got?

00:20.087 --> 00:22.120
Purse was tossed aside,
I.D. on the ground

00:22.188 --> 00:24.122
says her name
is Jessica King, age 29.

00:24.190 --> 00:26.190
Kid over there
found her, then promptly

00:26.259 --> 00:27.307
threw up his
Froot Loops.

00:27.308 --> 00:28.138
Poor little guy.

00:28.162 --> 00:29.895
Tough way to start
the day at any age.

00:29.896 --> 00:31.930
Thanks.

00:33.366 --> 00:34.966
I'm not seeing
any scratches

00:35.035 --> 00:36.534
or signs of
a struggle.

00:36.603 --> 00:38.080
She probably didn't even
see it coming.

00:38.104 --> 00:39.737
Single stab wound to the heart.

00:39.806 --> 00:41.284
You think that's a
message of some sort

00:41.308 --> 00:42.574
or just a lucky shot?

00:42.642 --> 00:43.942
Lucky for who?

00:44.010 --> 00:45.610
I don't know.

00:45.679 --> 00:48.513
That's what we'll have
to find out.

00:54.187 --> 00:56.120
Gramps? Hello?

00:56.189 --> 00:57.755
In here.

00:57.824 --> 01:00.491
Chemistry book you forgot
is there on the table.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.104
- What are you doing down there?
- Uh, the sink trap

01:02.128 --> 01:04.162
needed fixing.

01:04.230 --> 01:07.065
Hey, did you see a box
on the porch when you came in?

01:07.133 --> 01:08.253
No. You expecting something?

01:08.301 --> 01:10.068
Yeah.
Nicky's graduation present.

01:10.136 --> 01:11.069
A locket of Betty's

01:11.137 --> 01:12.770
that she's always loved.

01:12.839 --> 01:15.106
Clasp was broken,
so I sent it away to get fixed.

01:15.175 --> 01:17.286
It's supposed to be delivered
this morning.

01:17.310 --> 01:19.410
- Is that you or me?
- Not me.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.783
Ha. Speak of the devil.

01:25.852 --> 01:28.319
All right, help me up.

01:28.388 --> 01:30.622
According to the text,
the thing was just delivered.

01:30.690 --> 01:32.957
- I can go run out and grab it.
- No, no, no.

01:33.026 --> 01:35.093
At my age, when you commit
to standing up,

01:35.161 --> 01:36.761
you have to see it through.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:45.205 --> 01:47.105
Van's long gone.

01:47.173 --> 01:50.475
So where the hell's my package?

01:50.543 --> 01:52.644
It didn't
just disappear.

01:52.712 --> 01:54.812
You ever hear of porch pirates?

01:54.881 --> 01:56.814
Maybe somebody
stole it.

02:05.592 --> 02:07.236
- Reagan.
- Oh, thank God.

02:07.260 --> 02:08.916
I didn't know if you'd answer.

02:09.604 --> 02:10.571
Who's this?

02:10.783 --> 02:13.018
It's Armin Janko, Eddie's dad.

02:13.700 --> 02:16.634
Please don't hang up.

02:16.703 --> 02:19.270
Uh, you can't be out yet,
Mr. Janko.

02:19.339 --> 02:21.639
No, not for another
three to five.

02:21.708 --> 02:22.874
But I need to talk to you.

02:22.942 --> 02:24.208
Okay, talk.

02:24.277 --> 02:25.143
In person.

02:25.211 --> 02:26.778
I promise it's nothing bad.

02:26.846 --> 02:28.324
It's just something
I would rather discuss

02:28.348 --> 02:30.415
with my soon-to-be
son-in-law in person.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.450
Do me that one favor?

02:33.553 --> 02:35.520
Okay. Yeah.

02:35.588 --> 02:37.055
And don't tell my daughter.

02:37.123 --> 02:38.389
That's two favors.

02:38.458 --> 02:40.058
You can tell her soon,

02:40.126 --> 02:41.726
just come and hear me out first.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.430
All right, you got it.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.432
Bye.

02:56.976 --> 03:00.211
Just for the record, I think
asking her up here is a mistake.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.130
If there was a record,
you'd be on it.

03:02.131 --> 03:04.749
He's right, boss. All due
respect, I cannot imagine

03:04.818 --> 03:06.084
what you're thinking here.

03:06.152 --> 03:08.319
Sometimes a problem
is more manageable

03:08.388 --> 03:10.054
if you engage it from the top.

03:15.128 --> 03:17.895
Last chance to walk this back.

03:18.998 --> 03:21.432
Let's have her.

03:37.083 --> 03:38.850
Professor.

03:38.918 --> 03:41.719
Commissioner Moore,
Lieutenant Gormley.

03:41.788 --> 03:43.788
We've met.

03:45.525 --> 03:47.792
Have a seat.

03:53.833 --> 03:56.467
So we're looking at five
assaults on illegal immigrants

03:56.536 --> 03:59.871
allegedly committed
by an NYPD officer.

03:59.939 --> 04:01.606
Five, right?

04:01.674 --> 04:03.307
So far.

04:03.376 --> 04:05.943
And you're claiming
the exact same pattern

04:06.012 --> 04:09.413
in each of the five assaults?
- Yes.

04:09.482 --> 04:11.349
He show a shield
and an I.D. card?

04:11.417 --> 04:12.417
Every time.

04:12.485 --> 04:14.585
And verbally
identified himself

04:14.654 --> 04:15.898
as a New York City
police officer?

04:15.922 --> 04:18.122
Why do I feel like you're trying
to trip me up?

04:18.190 --> 04:20.158
No, we're just trying
to ascertain the facts.

04:20.226 --> 04:21.625
And balance them
against the fact

04:21.694 --> 04:24.162
that you have falsely accused
this department before.

04:24.230 --> 04:26.964
What possible agenda
could I have here?

04:27.033 --> 04:30.768
Well, that's what they call
the known unknown.

04:32.872 --> 04:36.040
The only known unknown here
is which cop.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.180
Tell me something.

04:42.248 --> 04:45.416
Are all the crimes in this city
committed by cops?

04:47.420 --> 04:51.656
Just setting the table
for the meal I'm expecting.

04:51.724 --> 04:55.393
Anonymous accusations
are difficult to investigate

04:55.461 --> 04:57.728
and even harder to prosecute.

04:57.797 --> 05:00.097
And that's not stonewalling you,
it's a fact.

05:00.166 --> 05:02.633
And it's why I convinced them
to give their names,

05:02.702 --> 05:05.369
addresses, phone numbers.

05:05.438 --> 05:07.605
We'll look into it.

05:08.708 --> 05:10.041
That's it?

05:10.109 --> 05:12.577
It will be investigated
thoroughly.

05:12.645 --> 05:15.346
That's what we do here.
Thanks for coming up.

05:22.755 --> 05:26.290
Your granddaughter Nicky
is a lovely young woman.

05:27.961 --> 05:30.228
You know my granddaughter?

05:30.296 --> 05:33.898
As does the Justice Coalition
board now.

05:35.635 --> 05:37.568
A job interview.

05:40.773 --> 05:42.039
First you've heard?

05:43.376 --> 05:46.210
And wondering
why you're letting me know.

05:47.313 --> 05:49.647
Gentlemen.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.487
Son of a bitch.

06:22.168 --> 06:24.101
I can't believe it.

06:24.170 --> 06:26.978
I-I said hi to Jessica
just yesterday evening.

06:26.979 --> 06:28.812
We saw she was a painter?

06:28.881 --> 06:30.313
Yeah. A lot of us
in the boat club

06:30.382 --> 06:31.593
have her paintings
on our walls at home.

06:31.617 --> 06:33.116
What time did you talk
to her?

06:33.185 --> 06:36.153
Hour before dusk.
Uh, I was locking up,

06:36.221 --> 06:39.723
but she was staying to paint
the s-sunset... Oh, God.

06:39.791 --> 06:41.191
What?

06:41.260 --> 06:46.496
O-On my way to the subway, I-I
saw him cycling into the park.

06:46.565 --> 06:47.888
Who's "him"?
The guy on the bike?

06:47.912 --> 06:48.986
Yeah.

06:48.987 --> 06:49.835
Central Perv.

06:49.859 --> 06:50.960
"Central Perv"?

06:50.961 --> 06:53.236
That's what some of us call him.
He-He's homeless.

06:53.305 --> 06:55.205
Doesn't make him a perv.

06:55.274 --> 06:58.041
Except when he's leering
at women or stripping naked

06:58.110 --> 07:00.577
to bathe in the pond.
You ask him to stop,

07:00.646 --> 07:02.524
and he yells how he's gonna
shove his handlebars

07:02.548 --> 07:04.014
up various parts
of your anatomy.

07:05.184 --> 07:06.683
Back to the scene of the crime?

07:06.752 --> 07:09.052
- All right. Sit tight.
- Yeah.

07:09.121 --> 07:10.887
Excuse me.

07:10.956 --> 07:13.456
Hey! Police! Hold it!

07:15.227 --> 07:17.694
Hold it!
Get out of the way!

07:17.763 --> 07:19.963
Move!

07:20.032 --> 07:21.598
Come here!

07:21.667 --> 07:22.766
Police!

07:24.770 --> 07:26.536
- I didn't do anything!
- Come here.

07:26.605 --> 07:28.238
- I know my rights.
- Nicely done.

07:28.307 --> 07:31.508
Thank you. Grab his stuff.
I got him.

07:35.581 --> 07:37.847
Are you absolutely sure?

07:40.852 --> 07:43.620
Okay, thanks.

07:43.689 --> 07:44.788
Yeah,

07:44.856 --> 07:46.790
he says
the guy dropped it off.

07:46.858 --> 07:48.658
But who the hell steals a box

07:48.727 --> 07:51.728
off your porch
in broad daylight?

07:51.797 --> 07:53.463
A lowlife. A dirtbag.

07:53.532 --> 07:54.943
- A scumbag. A crook.
- Hey, hey, hey.

07:54.967 --> 07:56.166
Language.

07:56.235 --> 07:57.434
What? I learned it from you.

07:57.502 --> 07:59.603
So what now,
you call 911?

07:59.671 --> 08:02.539
Nah. Without proof
it wouldn't go anywhere.

08:02.608 --> 08:05.809
Why not just, like, you know,
ask your neighbors?

08:05.877 --> 08:07.177
- For what?
- Maybe one of them

08:07.246 --> 08:09.879
has surveillance or, like,
the doorbell camera things.

08:16.521 --> 08:19.889
So what if I ran?
I'm an innocent man.

08:19.958 --> 08:22.392
An innocent man
nicknamed Central Perv.

08:22.461 --> 08:25.161
My name is Anderson Hardy, and
I was minding my own business.

08:25.230 --> 08:27.430
You mispronounced
"eyeballing the girl

08:27.499 --> 08:29.499
I murdered while being
armed to the teeth."

08:29.568 --> 08:31.434
Armed? I'm a peaceful person.

08:31.503 --> 08:34.203
A peaceful person with
a knife in his backpack.

08:34.273 --> 08:37.707
Oh, and a baton
in your backpack.

08:37.775 --> 08:41.443
And look at that, he also has
a screwdriver in his backpack.

08:41.513 --> 08:43.890
Refresh my memory. Where's the
last place we saw one of these?

08:43.914 --> 08:45.949
Stuck in the heart
of a dead girl.

08:46.018 --> 08:47.417
That's right. Almost forgot.

08:47.486 --> 08:48.852
I have those to defend myself.

08:48.920 --> 08:50.620
- Against who?
- Everyone.

08:50.689 --> 08:54.291
Businessmen who spit on me,
kids who steal my stuff.

08:54.359 --> 08:56.459
And no one hates on the homeless
like you cops.

08:56.528 --> 08:59.462
And how exactly was it
that Jessica hated on you?

08:59.531 --> 09:02.132
Let me guess-- she asked
you not to whip it out

09:02.200 --> 09:03.566
while she was trying to paint?

09:03.635 --> 09:05.702
She didn't hate me.
She was nice.

09:05.771 --> 09:07.537
If anyone killed her,
it was that other guy.

09:07.606 --> 09:09.372
Oh, the infamous other guy.

09:09.441 --> 09:12.042
- But there <i>was</i> another guy...
- Yeah!

09:12.110 --> 09:13.710
I didn't stop to say hi

09:13.779 --> 09:15.712
'cause Jessica
was already talking to him.

09:15.781 --> 09:17.147
Describe him.

09:17.215 --> 09:19.749
I, I didn't see his face.

09:19.818 --> 09:21.251
When you're homeless, you learn

09:21.320 --> 09:23.153
not to stare
at other people too long.

09:23.221 --> 09:25.789
Yeah.

09:25.857 --> 09:29.759
Well, this is your new home
now, my friend, so sit tight.

09:29.828 --> 09:31.194
We'll be back.

09:31.263 --> 09:33.574
M.E.'s office. You said to find
you the moment it was delivered.

09:33.598 --> 09:36.266
Thanks, Officer Meyers.

09:36.335 --> 09:38.768
What do we got?

09:38.837 --> 09:40.670
Uh, no prints
on the screwdriver,

09:40.739 --> 09:43.139
but there were skin cells
with the DNA

09:43.208 --> 09:46.743
which belongs to...
not Central Perv.

09:46.812 --> 09:47.489
What?

09:47.513 --> 09:49.413
The DNA belongs
to a Steve Rhodes.

09:49.414 --> 09:52.916
He was collared three
years ago on a D.W.I.

09:52.984 --> 09:54.918
So our guy is not our guy.

10:06.331 --> 10:08.098
Jamie.

10:10.102 --> 10:12.035
What do you want, Mr. Janko?

10:12.104 --> 10:15.572
I want to walk my little girl
down the aisle.

10:16.675 --> 10:19.376
Please. Come on.

10:22.848 --> 10:27.050
I will abide by every
rule, every condition.

10:27.119 --> 10:29.452
Why come to me and not to her?

10:29.521 --> 10:31.554
Y-You're higher up the
ladder than she is.

10:31.623 --> 10:35.091
Or because you know
that Eddie would say no.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.861
No. She, she wants
this as much as I do.

10:37.929 --> 10:38.962
Said so in her letters.

10:39.030 --> 10:40.130
Letters?

10:40.198 --> 10:42.365
She's been writing to me

10:42.434 --> 10:43.714
ever since you guys got engaged.

10:43.769 --> 10:45.568
I got a stack of them
in my cell.

10:46.671 --> 10:47.737
I'll show you.

10:47.806 --> 10:49.139
What would she write
you about?

10:49.207 --> 10:50.974
Father-daughter stuff.

10:51.042 --> 10:53.109
Starting life
with somebody

10:53.178 --> 10:55.445
and, you know,
how to make a marriage work.

10:55.514 --> 10:56.813
She came to you
about that?

10:56.882 --> 10:57.882
Whatever else I may be,

10:57.949 --> 10:59.682
I am still her father.

10:59.751 --> 11:02.318
So she comes to me
for advice, yes.

11:02.387 --> 11:04.454
As, I'm-I'm guessing,
you go to your family.

11:04.523 --> 11:07.690
I'm not sure that's...
the same thing.

11:07.759 --> 11:09.092
Armin, my dad...

11:09.161 --> 11:10.727
Is not behind bars.

11:10.796 --> 11:11.961
Yeah, I get it.

11:13.465 --> 11:14.597
Maybe, for one day,

11:14.666 --> 11:19.135
we could set all of that aside

11:19.204 --> 11:23.440
and we could all celebrate
your wedding together.

11:23.508 --> 11:24.508
As a family.

11:26.344 --> 11:28.745
As it should be.

11:36.321 --> 11:39.823
What's this place supposed
to be-- condos, offices?

11:39.891 --> 11:42.759
He's an app guy, he just
sold one for $10 million.

11:42.828 --> 11:44.479
Apparently, this is
the new headquarters.

11:44.503 --> 11:45.729
Fancy.

11:45.730 --> 11:47.297
Looks like him
over there.

11:47.365 --> 11:49.299
What's his last name?

11:49.367 --> 11:50.133
Rhodes.

11:50.202 --> 11:51.301
Steven Rhodes.

11:51.369 --> 11:53.036
Detective Reagan.

11:53.104 --> 11:54.537
My partner Detective Baez.

11:54.606 --> 11:56.306
How can I help you?

11:56.374 --> 11:57.614
Wanted to ask you
some questions

11:57.642 --> 11:58.942
about the murder
of Jessica King.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.610
What?

12:00.679 --> 12:01.679
First you've
heard of it?

12:01.746 --> 12:05.215
Yes. How?

12:05.283 --> 12:07.250
How's a good question.

12:07.319 --> 12:09.786
As in how was your DNA found
on the murder weapon?

12:09.855 --> 12:10.787
Hmm.

12:10.856 --> 12:12.055
But it wasn't me.

12:12.123 --> 12:13.690
Mm-hmm.

12:13.758 --> 12:16.192
Is everything okay, Steve?

12:16.261 --> 12:20.029
No. That Jessica,
the artist?

12:20.098 --> 12:21.598
She's been murdered.

12:21.666 --> 12:23.500
What? How?

12:23.568 --> 12:24.812
Identical twins...

12:24.836 --> 12:26.858
Identical twins
with identical DNA.

12:27.539 --> 12:31.207
Detectives, I'm telling you.
You're wrong about this.

12:31.276 --> 12:33.142
I was right here
last night.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.144
A-And I was right
here with him.

12:50.399 --> 12:52.835
Look... I wish I knew
who killed Jessica

12:52.836 --> 12:54.043
but I don't.

12:54.044 --> 12:55.122
And neither does my brother.

12:55.146 --> 12:56.952
But you admit that
you knew her.

12:56.953 --> 12:57.886
<i>I met her a couple times.</i>

12:57.954 --> 13:00.522
Steve's the one
who dated her.

13:00.590 --> 13:02.134
He ever mention
any trouble between 'em?

13:02.158 --> 13:03.858
Or you ever get
a sense of it

13:03.927 --> 13:06.361
with that mind-melding thing
twins have?

13:06.429 --> 13:07.996
Never.

13:08.064 --> 13:09.731
<i>Jessica and I had a lot of fun.</i>

13:09.799 --> 13:11.466
For as long as it lasted.

13:11.535 --> 13:12.734
Mm-hmm.

13:12.802 --> 13:15.270
These days, dating someone
for a week is like...

13:15.338 --> 13:16.571
getting married to 'em.

13:16.640 --> 13:18.406
Right.
Where'd you meet her?

13:18.475 --> 13:20.608
She hosts a drink-and-paint
night at a bar.

13:20.677 --> 13:22.377
She's very talented.

13:22.445 --> 13:25.580
Not anymore, thanks to you
or your brother.

13:25.649 --> 13:28.883
Ask any of my exes.
I'm a good boyfriend.

13:28.952 --> 13:32.420
And I haven't seen Jessica
since we broke up a month ago.

13:32.489 --> 13:33.988
Then why was one of you
seen with her

13:34.057 --> 13:35.790
in Central Park last night?

13:35.859 --> 13:37.659
Someone got it wrong.

13:37.727 --> 13:39.205
I told you, Steve and I
were in Jersey.

13:39.229 --> 13:41.095
And your DNA
on the murder weapon?

13:41.164 --> 13:43.698
Who knows? Maybe it was
one of our workers.

13:43.767 --> 13:45.781
It's not like we inventory
our screwdrivers every night.

13:45.782 --> 13:47.468
<i>I mean,</i>
do you count up every pencil

13:47.537 --> 13:48.469
you push around this place?

13:48.538 --> 13:51.639
That's how we're
gonna play this now?

13:51.708 --> 13:53.241
You're going to insult me?

13:53.310 --> 13:57.278
It's just... you won't even
let us be in the same room.

13:57.347 --> 13:59.881
Are there any other differences
between the two of you,

13:59.950 --> 14:00.982
besides the names?

14:01.051 --> 14:02.784
I was born three minutes
before Seth,

14:02.852 --> 14:04.919
so I always say I'm three
minutes smarter, cooler,

14:04.988 --> 14:06.254
and better-looking.

14:06.323 --> 14:08.089
Your twin says that about you?

14:08.158 --> 14:10.858
He's kidding.
We're best friends.

14:10.927 --> 14:12.727
Maybe that's why
he's the face of the company,

14:12.762 --> 14:14.796
and pretty much nobody
knows about you.

14:14.864 --> 14:16.464
I'm just as smart as Steve.

14:16.533 --> 14:17.732
Just about different things.

14:17.801 --> 14:19.045
<i>Except you weren't smart enough</i>

14:19.069 --> 14:21.469
to hire a lawyer already.

14:21.538 --> 14:23.871
Except we're innocent.

14:23.940 --> 14:25.306
Seth and I don't need a lawyer.

14:25.375 --> 14:26.641
We have each other.

14:26.710 --> 14:28.843
We have each other.

14:35.652 --> 14:37.285
Hit a brick wall, too, huh?

14:37.354 --> 14:40.555
So far. But I think Steve could
turn into a real dick

14:40.624 --> 14:41.823
if I push the right buttons.

14:41.891 --> 14:42.790
What about <i>your</i> twin?

14:42.859 --> 14:45.960
Seth seems a bit... shyer.

14:46.029 --> 14:48.162
So... you think yours
is the evil twin?

14:48.231 --> 14:50.832
I think one of them or both
of them is playing us.

14:50.900 --> 14:52.333
We just got to find out which.

14:57.641 --> 14:59.240
Someone stole it
off <i>your</i> porch?

14:59.309 --> 15:00.842
Yeah.

15:00.910 --> 15:03.311
My great-granddaughter's
graduation present.

15:03.380 --> 15:04.612
Oh.

15:04.681 --> 15:06.459
Which is why I'm hoping
that if they ran this way,

15:06.483 --> 15:07.448
your security camera

15:07.484 --> 15:09.484
up there filmed it.

15:09.552 --> 15:11.219
Let's check. Come in.

15:11.835 --> 15:14.489
I appreciate that, Donna.
Oh, of course.

15:14.557 --> 15:16.557
I'm just sorry
that, uh,

15:16.626 --> 15:20.361
I have go around to all my
neighbors because of this.

15:21.631 --> 15:23.698
Four cameras?

15:23.767 --> 15:26.734
I didn't know we had
a crime wave around here.

15:26.803 --> 15:29.737
Says the cop needing my help.

15:29.806 --> 15:32.607
Okay, there is
the front door view.

15:32.676 --> 15:34.375
What time did this happen?

15:34.444 --> 15:35.843
Just after 9:00.

15:35.912 --> 15:37.945
Okay.

15:38.014 --> 15:39.094
There's the son of a bitch!

15:39.149 --> 15:41.916
Let me zoom in and
put it in slow motion.

15:49.659 --> 15:50.659
Her name is...

15:50.694 --> 15:53.194
Alexis.

15:53.263 --> 15:54.495
You know her?

15:56.599 --> 15:59.033
She's my granddaughter.

15:59.102 --> 16:00.935
And an addict.

16:02.939 --> 16:04.872
Oh.

16:06.009 --> 16:06.941
Sorry.

16:07.010 --> 16:09.610
Why? She's not.

16:09.679 --> 16:11.679
And I guarantee you,
whatever was in your box,

16:11.748 --> 16:13.648
she's already
sold it for drugs.

16:13.717 --> 16:16.451
I don't understand.
Does she live here?

16:16.519 --> 16:19.387
Uh-huh. Till
last month, yeah.

16:22.592 --> 16:26.661
Uh...
I took Alexis in

16:26.730 --> 16:29.731
after her mother couldn't
handle her anymore.

16:29.799 --> 16:32.600
And all she did
was lie and steal.

16:32.669 --> 16:36.637
When I confronted her,
she slapped me

16:36.706 --> 16:39.741
and ran out that door.

16:39.809 --> 16:42.510
So I guess she's living
on the streets now.

16:42.579 --> 16:44.312
Look, Donna.

16:44.380 --> 16:46.347
I don't have
to report this.

16:46.416 --> 16:49.217
Oh, yes... you do.

16:49.285 --> 16:51.486
Or I will.

16:51.554 --> 16:54.789
Because Alexis has been given
every chance in the world.

16:54.858 --> 16:57.191
By me, by everyone.

16:57.260 --> 16:59.827
But she's your granddaughter.

16:59.896 --> 17:02.130
Who belongs in jail.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.334
So you take her name
and that tape,

17:06.402 --> 17:08.603
and you give it to the police,
and when they find her,

17:08.671 --> 17:10.003
press charges.

17:11.207 --> 17:13.875
I'm done.

17:21.785 --> 17:24.285
Those are our marching orders,
so let's make it happen.

17:25.588 --> 17:28.289
- Hey. Sis.
- Hey.

17:28.358 --> 17:29.524
Need your help.

17:29.592 --> 17:32.193
I got a, a dead girl.
I got two twin brothers

17:32.262 --> 17:34.006
covering for each other
'cause I'm pretty sure

17:34.030 --> 17:36.097
one of them killed her,
because I got one

17:36.166 --> 17:38.032
of their DNA
on the murder weapon.

17:38.101 --> 17:39.834
Wow. That's amazing.

17:39.903 --> 17:41.068
What's amazing?

17:41.137 --> 17:42.897
You actually came to me
with something solid.

17:42.939 --> 17:43.871
Aw, very funny.

17:43.940 --> 17:45.606
Look, can you just
do me a favor?

17:45.675 --> 17:47.708
I need help getting
a subpoena for phone records,

17:47.777 --> 17:50.144
financials, EZ pass,
anything I can use

17:50.213 --> 17:51.813
to put one of them
at the crime scene.

17:51.881 --> 17:53.147
Well, you'd better
hope it does.

17:53.216 --> 17:55.536
Otherwise I'm not sure this
office will be able to proceed.

17:55.585 --> 17:56.818
What are you
talking about?

17:56.886 --> 17:59.031
You just said I brought you
something solid with the DNA.

17:59.055 --> 18:01.155
Especially
with the DNA.

18:01.224 --> 18:02.590
It's exactly the same.

18:02.659 --> 18:03.858
So how is

18:03.927 --> 18:06.561
a jury supposed to decide
which one did it?

18:06.629 --> 18:10.364
And that is how a smart defense
attorney is going to play it.

18:10.433 --> 18:11.833
Thank you for the optimism.

18:11.901 --> 18:13.534
Hey, great, both
you guys are here?

18:13.603 --> 18:15.314
What are you doing here?
That's the question.

18:15.338 --> 18:16.771
I need your guys' help.

18:16.840 --> 18:18.484
You know how long I've been
waiting to hear that?

18:18.508 --> 18:19.356
Ha-ha.

18:19.380 --> 18:21.376
Just ignore her,
she's on a roll today.

18:21.377 --> 18:23.778
I want to get Eddie's dad
out of prison

18:23.847 --> 18:25.580
so he can come
to the wedding.

18:25.648 --> 18:27.348
You want to get that

18:27.417 --> 18:29.530
Bernie Madoff wannabe
out of prison?

18:29.554 --> 18:31.086
I, I know

18:31.087 --> 18:32.353
he ripped off a
bunch of people,

18:32.422 --> 18:33.621
but it's still her father.

18:33.690 --> 18:35.957
Ugh. Wow. Kid, you...

18:36.025 --> 18:37.236
you're
a better man than me,

18:37.260 --> 18:38.125
I'll tell you that.

18:38.194 --> 18:39.493
I think it's sweet.

18:39.562 --> 18:41.507
Maybe your office could put
a bug in the warden's ear?

18:41.531 --> 18:42.763
And, Danny,

18:42.832 --> 18:44.810
maybe you could nudge somebody
down at the Marshals' office

18:44.834 --> 18:47.368
to expedite a prisoner transpo?

18:47.437 --> 18:50.204
For you, for Eddie,
the wedding, yes,

18:50.273 --> 18:51.617
I know a guy,
I'll give him a call.

18:51.641 --> 18:53.074
Both of you guys,
thank you so much.

18:53.142 --> 18:55.109
Well, I'm happy to see
that Eddie has worked out

18:55.178 --> 18:56.477
all the problems
with her father.

18:56.546 --> 18:58.279
Well, I haven't told her yet.

19:00.383 --> 19:02.116
What do you mean,
you haven't told her yet?

19:02.185 --> 19:04.096
Well, Armin came to me
in private, and I don't want

19:04.120 --> 19:07.288
Eddie to get her hopes up
until I know I can pull it off.

19:07.357 --> 19:07.846
Oh.

19:07.870 --> 19:11.102
I'm not sure it's smart to start
a marriage off with a lie.

19:11.126 --> 19:11.994
No.

19:11.995 --> 19:14.115
It's not a lie. I'm just
withholding some information.

19:14.163 --> 19:15.997
Oh-- withholding?

19:16.065 --> 19:17.832
Withholding, hmm.

19:17.901 --> 19:19.634
Well, if you want to
know how withholding

19:19.702 --> 19:22.270
ever worked out for me
when I tried it with Linda,

19:22.338 --> 19:24.672
I could show you the scars,
'cause I still got 'em.

19:24.741 --> 19:26.051
- Guys, I'm gonna tell her.
- Nope.

19:26.075 --> 19:27.820
There's no "gonna"
when it comes to being honest

19:27.844 --> 19:30.444
with the person you love.
You got to tell her now.

19:30.513 --> 19:32.680
And I'd run.

19:32.749 --> 19:34.148
Don't walk.

19:35.818 --> 19:37.451
- You don't...
- Bye.

19:51.467 --> 19:52.500
Well?

19:52.568 --> 19:55.136
I know.

20:05.248 --> 20:06.725
I really appreciate you taking
the time.

20:06.749 --> 20:10.318
I always have time
for my favorite granddaughter.

20:10.386 --> 20:12.620
And only granddaughter.

20:12.689 --> 20:15.456
And congratulations
are in order.

20:15.525 --> 20:18.592
Can you believe it?
I'm finally graduating.

20:19.696 --> 20:21.329
That, too.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.033
You know?

20:27.136 --> 20:29.437
I think so.

20:30.573 --> 20:31.739
How?

20:31.808 --> 20:35.042
I'm the police commissioner.
I hear things.

20:36.846 --> 20:38.079
Your mom know?

20:38.147 --> 20:40.548
They called this morning.

20:40.616 --> 20:43.184
I'm headed to her next.

20:44.287 --> 20:46.253
So you're gonna take it?

20:47.323 --> 20:49.623
Yes.

20:49.692 --> 20:51.892
And before your head explodes...

20:51.961 --> 20:53.327
Hey.

20:53.396 --> 20:55.196
My head's fine.

20:55.264 --> 20:56.630
The New York Justice Coalition

20:56.699 --> 20:58.578
does work
for the disenfranchised...

20:58.602 --> 20:59.434
I'm sure they do.

20:59.435 --> 21:01.902
But most of their
complaints and suits

21:01.971 --> 21:03.504
are against my department.

21:03.573 --> 21:04.705
Which has a
spotless record?

21:04.774 --> 21:07.441
No, we make mistakes,
but it's nowhere near

21:07.510 --> 21:09.276
the picture
your new boss paints.

21:09.345 --> 21:11.979
And being a Reagan,
I can help her understand

21:12.048 --> 21:14.782
that the NYPD,
even with its flaws,

21:14.851 --> 21:17.084
is more friend than foe.

21:21.624 --> 21:25.860
Boy... that's a tall order.

21:25.928 --> 21:29.730
Nicky, you can only do
what you can do.

21:29.799 --> 21:33.134
You think she's gonna
try to use me as a spy.

21:33.202 --> 21:35.770
Certainly as a valued source.
Wouldn't be unheard of.

21:35.838 --> 21:38.606
For me it is.
Which I told her.

21:38.674 --> 21:42.043
And a little steam
came out of her ears,

21:42.111 --> 21:43.711
but she got it.

21:43.780 --> 21:46.914
Or said she did.

21:46.983 --> 21:52.286
Look, she's very smart
with a very specific agenda.

21:52.355 --> 21:54.989
And my eyes are wide open.

21:55.058 --> 21:57.591
Like I'm asking you
to keep yours.

22:02.131 --> 22:05.499
Look... I get it.

22:05.568 --> 22:08.269
I am only one,
but still I am one.

22:08.337 --> 22:11.906
I cannot do everything,
but I can do something, and...

22:11.974 --> 22:13.152
And because I cannot
do everything,

22:13.176 --> 22:16.177
I will not refuse
to do what I can.

22:23.686 --> 22:25.064
I know it's hard
to find your rhythm

22:25.088 --> 22:27.521
with a new partner at
first, but you just got

22:27.590 --> 22:28.856
to give it some time.

22:28.925 --> 22:30.691
This guy just eats nonstop.

22:30.760 --> 22:32.126
In the car, mouth open,

22:32.195 --> 22:33.928
food flying everywhere.

22:33.996 --> 22:35.796
Janko, got a second?

22:35.865 --> 22:38.766
You think riding with the
boss was easy at first?

22:38.835 --> 22:40.079
He drives slower
than my grandmother,

22:40.103 --> 22:42.036
and she's been dead ten years.

22:43.506 --> 22:44.438
Hey.

22:44.507 --> 22:46.540
Your father reached out to me,

22:46.609 --> 22:48.676
and I visited him in prison.

22:50.613 --> 22:52.146
Uh-uh, recently?

22:52.215 --> 22:53.481
Yes.

22:53.549 --> 22:54.699
About?

22:54.723 --> 22:56.251
He wants to come
to our wedding.

22:56.252 --> 22:58.219
He wants to get a furlough

22:58.287 --> 22:59.987
so that he can walk you
down the aisle.

23:03.526 --> 23:05.126
Oh, wow.

23:05.194 --> 23:07.628
Yeah, he said he had
a stack of letters from you

23:07.697 --> 23:09.196
that you wanted him there.

23:09.265 --> 23:11.565
I've never written my dad.

23:11.634 --> 23:13.367
I didn't say I bought it.

23:14.470 --> 23:17.371
Oh, my God, it's...

23:17.440 --> 23:19.373
It's always a scam with him.

23:19.442 --> 23:21.675
That said,
he did seem genuine.

23:22.745 --> 23:24.022
And I've already got
the wheels in motion

23:24.046 --> 23:26.680
to get him out.
- Without telling me?

23:26.749 --> 23:29.817
Before telling you.
There's a difference?

23:29.886 --> 23:31.752
Yeah, right.
Anyhow,

23:31.821 --> 23:34.021
it's up to you
and you alone.

23:34.090 --> 23:35.756
I just thought...

23:35.825 --> 23:38.392
my whole family's
gonna be there.

23:38.461 --> 23:41.228
Maybe yours could be, too.

23:51.952 --> 23:54.219
I know they're twins,
and I know twins stick together,

23:54.288 --> 23:55.521
but this is nuts.

23:55.589 --> 23:57.489
These two live together,
work together.

23:57.558 --> 23:59.525
They even got joint
bank accounts together.

23:59.593 --> 24:01.026
What about their
joint alibi?

24:01.095 --> 24:03.896
GPS says they were together
at the office

24:03.964 --> 24:06.465
at the time they said
they were together, no surprise.

24:06.534 --> 24:08.267
And I got neither cars traveling

24:08.335 --> 24:10.736
from Jersey City
to Central Park.

24:11.151 --> 24:13.050
Here, see if I missed anything.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.553
I'll tell you, I never believed

24:15.622 --> 24:17.388
there was any such thing
as a perfect crime,

24:17.457 --> 24:19.724
but these two morons might have
somehow pulled one off.

24:19.793 --> 24:21.826
You sound like you admire 'em.

24:21.895 --> 24:24.562
I appreciate their <i>apparent</i>
loyalty to each other.

24:24.631 --> 24:27.064
That's it.
I mean,

24:27.133 --> 24:28.811
did you ever cover for your
brother when he broke the law?

24:28.835 --> 24:31.869
No, I never covered
for Javi, not once.

24:31.938 --> 24:34.739
And his were just drug crimes.

24:34.808 --> 24:36.385
What about you? Would you
cover for your brother?

24:36.409 --> 24:38.709
If he broke the law?
I don't know.

24:38.778 --> 24:40.077
You don't know?

24:40.146 --> 24:41.913
Well, I'd like to say
I know, but...

24:41.981 --> 24:44.682
sometimes we do things
with family

24:44.751 --> 24:45.828
that doesn't always make sense.

24:45.852 --> 24:48.686
The only thing that
does make sense right now

24:48.755 --> 24:49.854
is we're screwed.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.057
Well, did you see this?

24:53.126 --> 24:54.192
What?

24:54.260 --> 24:56.360
Seth had three hour-long
phone conversations

24:56.429 --> 24:58.529
with Jessica the week
leading up to her murder.

24:58.598 --> 25:01.532
Seth? I thought
she was dating Steve.

25:01.601 --> 25:04.469
Right. Maybe she was
getting help from Seth

25:04.537 --> 25:05.570
to get Steve back?

25:05.638 --> 25:07.438
Or maybe Steve was trying
to throw us off

25:07.507 --> 25:09.207
by using Seth's phone.

25:09.275 --> 25:12.109
Okay, well, then we're
back to square one.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.378
The only girl that can tell
us anything about these two

25:14.447 --> 25:16.447
is too dead to
tell us anything.

25:16.516 --> 25:18.449
Yep.

25:20.086 --> 25:21.719
Unless there was
someone else.

25:23.423 --> 25:24.943
Did you just pull that
out of your hat?

25:26.326 --> 25:28.593
No, Steve told me.

25:33.800 --> 25:35.366
Henry.

25:37.704 --> 25:39.837
What's going on?

25:39.906 --> 25:42.340
Alexis was caught stealing
other packages

25:42.408 --> 25:44.876
about a mile from here.

25:44.944 --> 25:47.078
You said you were going
to have her arrested.

25:47.146 --> 25:48.980
Oh, she went to the station,

25:49.048 --> 25:51.949
but I'd put in a
want card on her,

25:52.018 --> 25:53.718
so they gave me a call.

25:55.522 --> 25:58.389
Okay. So?

25:58.458 --> 26:01.092
Don't you want
to talk to her?

26:01.160 --> 26:03.427
I told you, I am done.

26:03.496 --> 26:05.796
The people she stole from
don't want to press charges.

26:05.865 --> 26:06.964
And I've talked to her.

26:07.033 --> 26:09.133
She knows what
she did was wrong.

26:09.202 --> 26:12.136
And I know that an addict
will do whatever it takes

26:12.205 --> 26:13.371
to squirm free.

26:13.439 --> 26:14.906
She's conning you, Henry.

26:14.974 --> 26:19.677
When I asked her to tell me
where she pawned the necklace,

26:19.746 --> 26:22.046
I went there.

26:22.115 --> 26:25.383
Lo and behold.

26:25.451 --> 26:27.485
So maybe she does
want to change.

26:27.554 --> 26:29.787
Henry, I...

26:29.856 --> 26:31.422
I also made a few
phone calls

26:31.491 --> 26:33.057
and got the name
of a rehab center.

26:33.126 --> 26:35.726
The best in Brooklyn.

26:35.795 --> 26:38.129
I'm sure we could find
a sympathetic judge.

26:38.197 --> 26:40.498
And if she runs away again?

26:40.567 --> 26:42.166
We'll go after her again.

26:42.235 --> 26:45.336
Over and over,
until the end of time?

26:45.405 --> 26:47.238
Donna, if you abandon
the girl now,

26:47.307 --> 26:48.706
I think it'll be
the end of her.

26:48.775 --> 26:51.008
I'm not saying it'll work,

26:51.077 --> 26:55.346
but... isn't family
worth a shot?

27:22.108 --> 27:24.842
Come here, honey.

27:46.666 --> 27:49.200
Hey. What's all that?

27:49.268 --> 27:52.703
I'm gonna digitize a bunch
of these old family photos

27:52.772 --> 27:55.640
and make a slide show
for the reception.

27:55.708 --> 27:58.009
So everyone can see
the two families united?

27:58.077 --> 28:00.478
Exactly.

28:00.546 --> 28:05.316
Erin sent over a bunch of
Reagan family photo albums.

28:05.385 --> 28:07.752
And I found this.

28:07.820 --> 28:10.655
They look so proud of you.

28:10.723 --> 28:13.124
Not as proud as she would
have been meeting you.

28:18.331 --> 28:21.165
My mom brought over a bunch
of pictures of us, too.

28:21.234 --> 28:22.266
Yeah?

28:22.335 --> 28:26.570
And, uh, there's a bunch
of me and my dad.

28:28.174 --> 28:30.908
Better days, huh?

28:30.977 --> 28:33.844
Did you tell Lena
that he wants to come?

28:33.913 --> 28:38.149
Yeah, and, I mean, she
thinks it's a good idea.

28:38.217 --> 28:39.316
And you?

28:42.321 --> 28:46.223
I mean, maybe it's time to
make some new family memories.

28:49.228 --> 28:52.430
Nicky, my tribute
to your graduation

28:52.498 --> 28:53.698
comes from Teddy Roosevelt.

28:53.766 --> 28:56.734
But I had to alter
the gender pronouns

28:56.803 --> 28:59.603
for these modern
times, et cetera.

28:59.672 --> 29:01.906
So, a woman who has never
gone to school

29:01.974 --> 29:04.341
may steal from a freight car.

29:04.410 --> 29:07.044
But if she has
a university education,

29:07.113 --> 29:10.014
she may steal
the whole railroad.

29:10.083 --> 29:12.783
Hear, hear.

29:12.852 --> 29:16.120
And thank you again
for this beautiful necklace.

29:16.189 --> 29:18.355
- Yeah, you did good, Pop.
- Hello? I helped.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.391
Okay, fine,
you get thanks, too.

29:20.460 --> 29:21.726
Yeah, while we're
on the topic,

29:21.794 --> 29:23.127
when I graduate
from high school,

29:23.196 --> 29:25.496
I don't want, like, a necklace
or anything, just a car.

29:25.565 --> 29:26.664
Oh.

29:26.733 --> 29:28.299
<i>If</i> you graduate
high school.

29:28.367 --> 29:29.802
And here I had you pegged
for a necklace guy.

29:29.826 --> 29:30.902
Ha, ha.

29:30.903 --> 29:33.270
We'll take that
under advisement, Sean.

29:33.339 --> 29:34.705
What kind of car?

29:34.774 --> 29:35.840
Are you really asking?

29:35.908 --> 29:37.208
No.

29:38.945 --> 29:39.877
So, what's next?

29:39.946 --> 29:41.312
Do you have
any job prospects?

29:44.550 --> 29:46.650
Oh, what just happened?

29:46.719 --> 29:49.653
I... have an offer.

29:49.722 --> 29:50.988
Only one?

29:51.057 --> 29:53.457
Must be tough sledding for
the college kids these days.

29:53.526 --> 29:54.458
She would have had a lot more

29:54.527 --> 29:55.826
if she asked any of us for help.

29:55.895 --> 29:59.897
Is it so wrong that I want
to stand on my own two feet?

29:59.966 --> 30:02.299
Depends on whose business
those feet take you to

30:02.368 --> 30:03.534
for an application.

30:03.603 --> 30:07.571
And who, exactly,
are you two speaking of in code?

30:07.640 --> 30:08.706
Corey Vallejo.

30:08.775 --> 30:10.941
What?

30:11.010 --> 30:12.877
She's posting job offers?

30:12.945 --> 30:15.379
What's it say, "Molotov cocktail
experience a plus"?

30:15.448 --> 30:16.714
That's not what she's about.

30:16.783 --> 30:18.160
- You could have fooled me.
- Me, too.

30:18.184 --> 30:19.216
Me three.

30:19.285 --> 30:21.719
She tried to frame
your own grandfather

30:21.788 --> 30:22.965
with that fake
hit-and-run job.

30:22.989 --> 30:24.233
Come on, you know that
she and her organization

30:24.257 --> 30:25.389
do good things.

30:25.458 --> 30:26.869
Lot of ways to do
good things in the world.

30:26.893 --> 30:27.936
Throwing bombs isn't one of 'em.

30:27.960 --> 30:28.893
She really throw bombs?

30:28.961 --> 30:31.428
- Figure of speech.
- So far as we know.

30:31.497 --> 30:34.198
Francis, you can't possibly
think this is a good idea.

30:39.705 --> 30:41.338
You know what I think?

30:41.407 --> 30:43.374
I look at Nicky,
and I see the same person

30:43.442 --> 30:45.543
I've always seen sitting there.

30:45.611 --> 30:48.712
Because for two decades
around this table,

30:48.781 --> 30:49.880
she stood up to you.

30:49.949 --> 30:51.916
And me and
everybody else.

30:51.984 --> 30:56.020
And she has given
as good as she's got.

30:57.123 --> 30:59.323
I, for one, couldn't be prouder.

31:00.493 --> 31:04.261
So, as Ignatius of Loyola said,

31:04.330 --> 31:07.097
"Go forth and set
the world on fire."

31:17.610 --> 31:18.610
Well...

31:22.682 --> 31:25.249
Thank you for today.

31:26.886 --> 31:29.220
And yet?

31:33.059 --> 31:34.992
I'm a little worried.

31:35.061 --> 31:37.428
Are you, now?

31:37.496 --> 31:41.298
Why did Corey tell you
in the first place?

31:41.367 --> 31:44.501
You're not buying
the olive branch?

31:44.570 --> 31:47.271
Are you?

31:47.340 --> 31:49.673
Never did.
She's working an angle.

31:49.742 --> 31:51.709
But what?

31:55.448 --> 31:57.381
I have no idea.

32:02.388 --> 32:05.055
When I became PC,
Pop said something to me

32:05.124 --> 32:07.625
that I thought was
way too cynical

32:07.693 --> 32:10.794
until I got burned
a couple of times.

32:10.863 --> 32:13.163
"A good person pays back favors.

32:13.232 --> 32:16.467
A smart one pays them forward."

32:16.535 --> 32:18.502
Okay.

32:20.606 --> 32:22.206
When you had your job interview,

32:22.275 --> 32:25.042
I mean, you must not have
just talked business,

32:25.111 --> 32:27.244
there must've been chitchat.

32:27.313 --> 32:30.581
She asked about our family.

32:30.650 --> 32:32.917
Did she talk about hers?

32:32.985 --> 32:34.718
Yeah.

32:49.441 --> 32:50.441
Eddie.

32:51.910 --> 32:52.742
Hey, Dad.

32:52.811 --> 32:55.445
You came.

32:55.513 --> 32:57.747
- Thank you.
- It's all her.

32:59.617 --> 33:01.084
You look good.

33:01.152 --> 33:03.019
And you look more beautiful
than ever.

33:03.088 --> 33:04.287
Okay, let's not go crazy.

33:04.355 --> 33:06.756
You do, you do.

33:06.825 --> 33:09.125
Figured I should
ask you in person.

33:09.194 --> 33:12.795
Dad, you want to come
to our wedding?

33:12.864 --> 33:15.465
Nothing would make me happier.

33:15.533 --> 33:17.266
If you want me to.

33:17.335 --> 33:20.369
It's just 12 hours, Armin,
just there and back.

33:20.438 --> 33:22.705
And you're-you're sure this
is okay with your mother,

33:22.774 --> 33:23.873
me being there?

33:23.942 --> 33:27.443
Yeah, she's okay.
Uh, it's my wedding.

33:27.512 --> 33:31.781
Even the Jankos should be
able to pull this one off.

33:31.850 --> 33:34.584
Listen, I know
I don't deserve this.

33:36.621 --> 33:38.554
Oh, thank you, my angel.

33:38.623 --> 33:43.259
You always
looked out for me.

33:43.328 --> 33:44.794
Would you say that again, Dad?

33:44.863 --> 33:45.962
What? About you

33:46.030 --> 33:49.665
being my angel
looking out for me?

33:49.734 --> 33:52.635
We made a mistake.

33:52.704 --> 33:53.704
What do you mean?

33:53.771 --> 33:56.205
- Yeah, yeah, angel...
- Don't say that, Dad.

33:56.274 --> 33:57.340
What? You are...

33:57.408 --> 33:59.408
Only when you need help
squirming out of a jam.

33:59.477 --> 34:01.455
My whole life, that's the only
time you use those words.

34:01.479 --> 34:03.012
I don't know
what you're talking about.

34:03.081 --> 34:05.081
When the police came knocking
and I swore to them

34:05.150 --> 34:06.916
that you had been
home all night,

34:06.985 --> 34:09.284
and the millions
of times that you

34:09.353 --> 34:12.755
convinced me to tell Mom that
you weren't having an affair.

34:12.824 --> 34:15.123
- Eddie...
- What's the con this time, Dad?

34:15.193 --> 34:18.058
Other than telling Jamie that
I'd been writing you letters.

34:18.996 --> 34:20.688
You gonna rip off
the caterer?

34:20.690 --> 34:22.145
Make a break for it
when you get out?

34:22.146 --> 34:24.813
Eddie, Eddie, Th-there's no con
at all this time.

34:24.882 --> 34:27.014
I don't care.

34:27.985 --> 34:30.585
Come on, we're, we're going.

34:30.654 --> 34:32.587
- Right behind you.
- Eddie...

34:32.656 --> 34:34.289
Eddie, please.

34:39.163 --> 34:42.898
Yeah, I dated Steve. His condo's
a mile from mine in Jersey. Why?

34:42.966 --> 34:45.199
Steve told us that
any of his former girlfriends

34:45.268 --> 34:47.168
would vouch for him
and say he's a great guy.

34:48.672 --> 34:50.906
- Oh, God. Yeah.
- So it's not true?

34:50.974 --> 34:53.408
No, he is. We had
a lot of fun last summer,

34:53.476 --> 34:54.842
and he's great in bed.

34:54.911 --> 34:56.745
Surprised he didn't
mention that part.

34:56.813 --> 34:58.814
Until the last time,
and then it was just odd.

34:59.950 --> 35:01.349
Odd how?

35:01.418 --> 35:02.918
Uh, he was gentler,

35:02.986 --> 35:05.353
shyer. I mean,
vanilla sex

35:05.422 --> 35:08.290
wasn't why I was with Steve,
but it's like, all of a sudden,

35:08.358 --> 35:09.524
he was just a different guy.

35:11.161 --> 35:12.732
Seth?

35:12.756 --> 35:13.830
Seth.

35:14.648 --> 35:16.281
Who's Seth?

35:16.349 --> 35:18.950
Steve Rhodes has a twin brother.

35:19.019 --> 35:21.085
What?

35:21.341 --> 35:22.518
Wait, are you saying
that I slept

35:22.542 --> 35:23.641
with Steve's brother?

35:24.711 --> 35:26.544
What happened after the sex?

35:26.613 --> 35:29.848
He ghosted me, which is why
it was weird that he showed up

35:29.916 --> 35:32.117
at my place the other night
asking to borrow my car.

35:32.185 --> 35:33.485
Why?

35:33.553 --> 35:34.919
He said his was in the shop

35:34.988 --> 35:36.387
and he needed
to talk to somebody

35:36.456 --> 35:38.225
who was trying to ruin his life.

35:38.226 --> 35:39.425
He used those exact words?

35:40.332 --> 35:41.531
Yeah.

35:41.600 --> 35:43.466
Yeah,
he seemed pissed.

35:43.535 --> 35:45.936
And you're sure it was Steve,
not Seth?

35:46.004 --> 35:48.705
When he dropped off my car,
he kissed me

35:48.774 --> 35:51.374
and everything lit up again,

35:51.443 --> 35:54.144
so, yeah, it was Steve.

36:37.359 --> 36:40.794
Henry, she was
so excited last night.

36:40.863 --> 36:45.098
Said that she really
did want to get clean,

36:45.167 --> 36:47.668
and then when I came
to get her this morning...

36:49.471 --> 36:51.638
Apparently it's a thing
with addicts.

36:51.707 --> 36:54.841
One last blowout
before they head to rehab.

36:54.910 --> 36:59.313
But I told her that
it was gonna be okay.

36:59.381 --> 37:00.847
I let my guard down.

37:00.916 --> 37:03.083
No, if anybody screwed up here,
it was me.

37:03.152 --> 37:04.484
You?

37:04.553 --> 37:07.254
If she'd gone to jail
like you wanted,

37:07.323 --> 37:09.356
she never would've been able
to get those drugs.

37:09.425 --> 37:13.527
No. No, Henry,
you, you helped me,

37:13.596 --> 37:15.596
you helped...

37:15.664 --> 37:17.931
you helped us.

37:18.000 --> 37:21.034
Even if just for one minute,

37:21.103 --> 37:23.837
I had that little girl back.

37:31.680 --> 37:33.413
So what now?

37:33.482 --> 37:37.618
Now... you go on.

37:37.686 --> 37:39.453
With God's help.

37:39.521 --> 37:42.356
Mine, too, if you want.

37:45.094 --> 37:48.195
It's nice to have neighbors

37:48.264 --> 37:50.530
that I can count on.

38:06.882 --> 38:08.815
Walter Mills.

38:10.686 --> 38:12.753
You're sure he's the right guy?

38:12.821 --> 38:15.322
All five victims I.D.'d him
in separate lineups,

38:15.391 --> 38:18.558
and under questioning he
confessed to all five assaults.

38:21.697 --> 38:24.131
Do you want to schedule the
press conference, or should I?

38:24.199 --> 38:26.033
Oh, definitely you.

38:27.469 --> 38:29.403
Thank you.

38:29.896 --> 38:31.672
I won't be attending.

38:33.742 --> 38:36.310
Okay.

38:36.378 --> 38:38.145
What?

38:38.213 --> 38:40.580
He's not a cop, never was.

38:40.649 --> 38:42.282
The shield and I.D. were bogus,

38:42.351 --> 38:44.918
but, by all means,
you should talk to the press.

38:44.987 --> 38:48.355
They deserve to know that
that man is off the street,

38:48.424 --> 38:52.059
and you deserve the credit
for lighting a fire under us.

38:55.731 --> 38:58.865
Thank you. I mean it.

38:58.934 --> 39:01.001
And thank you for hiring Nicky.

39:01.070 --> 39:02.969
I mean that, too.

39:05.074 --> 39:07.307
Really?

39:07.376 --> 39:11.078
Yeah, she will make a great
addition to your organization,

39:11.146 --> 39:14.614
just as Carlos will in the NYPD.

39:15.684 --> 39:18.118
Carlos...

39:18.187 --> 39:20.153
my brother?

39:20.222 --> 39:22.389
Exactly.

39:22.458 --> 39:25.726
You know, it's always tough to
find out a promising applicant

39:25.794 --> 39:29.296
has been turned down because
of a minor brush with the law.

39:29.365 --> 39:31.264
So you pulled a string?

39:32.368 --> 39:34.301
I am the string.

39:38.474 --> 39:40.907
So, in a perfect world,

39:40.976 --> 39:43.810
we might call this "familia,"

39:43.879 --> 39:47.013
but in the imperfect world
that we live in,

39:47.082 --> 39:49.783
why don't we just
call it "insurance"?

39:56.492 --> 39:58.792
See you soon, Frank.

39:59.895 --> 40:02.629
Most likely.

40:07.603 --> 40:10.237
All right, here we go.
Go, clear it out.

40:10.305 --> 40:12.439
Right here, get out.
Let's go, everybody move it out.

40:12.508 --> 40:13.940
Come on. Let's go.

40:14.009 --> 40:16.443
You, out! Ah-ah-ah. Not you two.

40:16.512 --> 40:19.579
This again? We're on a deadline.

40:19.648 --> 40:20.714
So just kill us, Steve.

40:20.783 --> 40:21.882
- Excuse me?
- Why not?

40:21.950 --> 40:23.650
You killed Jessica,
and God knows

40:23.719 --> 40:25.330
your brother will cover
for you again, right?

40:25.354 --> 40:27.254
I didn't cover
for anyone.

40:27.322 --> 40:29.623
We know it sounds weird,
but not as weird

40:29.691 --> 40:32.058
as the two of you tricking girls
to get you laid.

40:32.127 --> 40:34.384
You know what? Now I am gonna
call our lawyer.

40:34.408 --> 40:34.929
Good.

40:34.930 --> 40:36.730
Then you can tell
your lawyer that we got

40:36.799 --> 40:38.131
tollbooth photos
of you driving

40:38.200 --> 40:39.733
Karlynn Bell's car
into the city.

40:39.802 --> 40:41.568
And a bunch of
other ex-girlfriends

40:41.637 --> 40:42.969
willing to testify.

40:43.038 --> 40:46.206
Karlynn,
Annette, Bianca.

40:46.275 --> 40:48.241
All of them told us
the same exact story.

40:48.310 --> 40:49.609
And when a jury
hears about that,

40:49.678 --> 40:52.045
plus the DNA evidence
on the murder weapon,

40:52.114 --> 40:54.080
plus your little sex switcheroo,

40:54.149 --> 40:56.082
it's gonna be
buh-bye for you guys.

40:56.151 --> 40:57.918
- Steve...
- Shut up, Seth.

40:57.986 --> 40:59.920
Starting to get to you, Seth?

40:59.988 --> 41:02.289
- Nothing's getting to me.
- Course it is.

41:02.357 --> 41:03.368
For the first time, you slept

41:03.392 --> 41:04.324
with one
of your brother's girlfriends

41:04.393 --> 41:05.892
and they weren't creeped out
by you.

41:05.961 --> 41:07.327
That why Jessica

41:07.396 --> 41:08.628
kept calling you?

41:08.697 --> 41:10.230
'Cause somebody
finally liked you

41:10.299 --> 41:12.566
more than your twin,
which pissed him off good.

41:12.634 --> 41:13.567
No, no, no, that isn't true.

41:13.635 --> 41:14.835
Don't listen to them.

41:14.903 --> 41:16.837
You must've been pretty
pissed off, Steve.

41:16.905 --> 41:19.339
You couldn't let Jessica
take Seth away from you

41:19.408 --> 41:21.708
and ruin the lives
you two had together,

41:21.777 --> 41:24.611
so you killed her and
made him cover for you

41:24.680 --> 41:26.947
because nothing is allowed
to come between you two.

41:27.015 --> 41:28.181
And nothing ever will.

41:28.250 --> 41:29.727
Except maybe
a few thousand miles.

41:29.751 --> 41:31.629
We're gonna make sure
you go to different states

41:31.653 --> 41:33.119
and do your time.

41:33.188 --> 41:34.488
Unless you
want to 'fess up

41:34.556 --> 41:35.588
and maybe we can
change our minds.

41:35.612 --> 41:37.612
Yeah.

41:38.260 --> 41:40.627
Come hell or high water?

41:40.696 --> 41:43.330
Come hell or high water.

41:44.433 --> 41:46.700
- Love you, brother.
- Love you.

41:46.768 --> 41:48.335
Okay, I'm gonna
take that as a no.

41:48.403 --> 41:50.763
Turn around, put your hands
behind your back, both of you.

41:51.773 --> 41:53.840
Oh, my God!

41:56.745 --> 41:59.079
- You okay?
- Yeah.

41:59.147 --> 42:02.682
5-4 detectives to Central.
I need a bus at this location.

42:02.751 --> 42:04.684
