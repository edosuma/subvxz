Walk on.

03:20.994 --> 03:22.327
Really?

03:22.361 --> 03:25.464
HETTY: Yesterday afternoon
at the Vietnam Consulate.

03:25.498 --> 03:28.967
No identification yet
on the victim or the shooter.

03:29.002 --> 03:30.302
Is it a coroner's case?

03:30.336 --> 03:31.420
Hospital case.

03:31.471 --> 03:32.921
Uh, Saint Anne's.

03:32.972 --> 03:35.123
The young man
was rather fortunate.

03:35.158 --> 03:38.143
A wound to the arm
and concussion from the fall.

03:38.178 --> 03:39.511
What about the car?

03:39.545 --> 03:41.363
Uh, license
plates removed.

03:41.397 --> 03:43.548
Tinted windows. Can't make out
the driver or the shooter.

03:43.566 --> 03:46.051
Mm, sounds like something
for LAPD.

03:46.069 --> 03:47.352
Miss Jones?

03:47.386 --> 03:49.188
Last week,
same location.

03:50.824 --> 03:52.441

Hmm. Looks like

03:52.492 --> 03:54.226
somebody didn't get
their visa approved.

03:54.244 --> 03:55.727
NELL:
Tomorrow morning,

03:55.745 --> 03:57.496
the consulate hosts
a Southeast Asian conference.

03:57.530 --> 03:59.214
With key diplomats

03:59.249 --> 04:01.166
from 11 different countries.

04:01.201 --> 04:03.168
Including the Secretary
of the Navy.

04:03.203 --> 04:04.703
SAM:
Philippines and Indonesia.

04:04.737 --> 04:06.138
They've got Islamic

04:06.172 --> 04:07.239
cells that would like

04:07.257 --> 04:08.807
to destabilize American ties
in the region.

04:08.842 --> 04:10.843
Well, hospital
or consulate?

04:10.877 --> 04:12.211
SAM AND DEEKS:
Hospital.

04:14.180 --> 04:16.932
Consulate.

04:18.468 --> 04:20.385
Everything
you can find

04:20.418 --> 04:23.421
on groups who oppose
the current regime in Vietnam,

04:23.439 --> 04:24.589
please, Eric.

04:24.607 --> 04:25.774
I'm on it.

04:25.808 --> 04:28.227
Sweet three-pointer, Nell.

04:28.261 --> 04:29.928
Oh.

04:29.946 --> 04:31.463
Thanks, Hetty.

04:35.218 --> 04:38.203
The bullet in the arm didn't
cause any critical damage.

04:38.238 --> 04:40.072
They repaired
his scalp laceration,

04:40.106 --> 04:42.541
but he's still confused
from the concussion.

04:42.575 --> 04:44.159
Does he know
who shot him?

04:49.916 --> 04:51.166
No identification on him?

04:51.217 --> 04:53.135
No. He's a John Doe.

04:53.169 --> 04:56.004
What's your name?

04:57.724 --> 05:00.392
His name is Tuan Nguyen.

05:02.628 --> 05:03.729
And you are...?

05:03.763 --> 05:07.799
Yen Tran, his employer.

05:07.817 --> 05:09.434
We started
phoning hospitals

05:09.468 --> 05:12.137
when he didn't show up
for work today.

05:12.155 --> 05:14.439
I'm glad we found him.

05:14.473 --> 05:15.774
Special Agent Hanna.

05:15.808 --> 05:17.576
Special Agent Callen.

05:17.610 --> 05:19.027
What kind of
work does he do?

05:19.078 --> 05:20.195
Garment district.

05:20.246 --> 05:21.530
He's a tailor.

05:21.564 --> 05:23.248
Does he speak English?

05:23.283 --> 05:26.151
No. He comes
from a small village.

05:26.185 --> 05:29.321
Sends money home
to his family.

05:29.339 --> 05:32.324
I brought his passport.

05:32.342 --> 05:34.426
Any history
of criminal behavior?

05:34.460 --> 05:35.827
Never.

05:35.845 --> 05:37.596
Very honest.

05:37.630 --> 05:39.664
Hard worker.

05:43.019 --> 05:46.171
The passport's valid,
visa's current.

05:46.189 --> 05:48.106
Yeah?

05:48.141 --> 05:49.891
I'll scan a
copy to Eric.

05:49.943 --> 05:51.526
YEN:
He said,

05:51.561 --> 05:55.680
a stranger in a car started
to chase him on Wilshire.

05:55.698 --> 05:58.233
We need to make a photocopy
of the passport.

05:58.284 --> 06:00.402
Of course.

06:05.691 --> 06:07.626
What's in here?

06:07.660 --> 06:10.462
Uh, cut-up clothes
from the paramedics.

06:10.496 --> 06:15.133
I may have to take a swab just
to test for any residue...

06:15.168 --> 06:18.203
"James Cleary,
U.S. Marine Corps."

06:18.221 --> 06:21.974
Does he know this man?

06:29.232 --> 06:31.667
Why is he carrying his name?

06:54.791 --> 06:57.676
So, uh, you know
what'd be nice?

06:57.710 --> 06:59.211
What?
A little trophy

06:59.245 --> 07:00.578
for the winning team.

07:00.596 --> 07:02.347
It would look great
next to my stapler.

07:02.382 --> 07:04.466
Why yours and not mine?
What's wrong with my desk?

07:04.517 --> 07:07.386
Nothing an industrial vacuum
cleaner couldn't fix.

07:07.420 --> 07:10.472
Okay, so I like to keep stuff
on my desk.

07:10.523 --> 07:12.140
Big deal.
Stuff?

07:12.191 --> 07:14.976
Really? What color
is your desk exactly?

07:15.028 --> 07:18.313
Brown. Brownish?

07:18.364 --> 07:19.597
Timber or laminate?

07:19.615 --> 07:20.982
Laminate?

07:21.034 --> 07:22.901
Really?

07:22.935 --> 07:24.602
We're coming up
to the consulate.

07:24.620 --> 07:26.271
Head of security's
waiting for us.

07:26.289 --> 07:27.406
We best focus.

07:27.440 --> 07:29.441
I used to bust Asian bangers
back in the day.

07:29.459 --> 07:31.576
They should just check
this kid for gang tattoos.

07:31.627 --> 07:34.212
I mean, it could be
just a routine drive-by.

07:34.247 --> 07:36.581
(tires squealing,
glass breaking)

07:45.308 --> 07:47.676
That didn't feel so routine.

07:48.895 --> 07:50.812
No.

07:50.847 --> 07:53.665
No, it didn't.

08:05.052 --> 08:09.937
The car that went boom is
registered to Cadeo Hoang.

08:09.938 --> 08:11.622
He's an attorney
in Orange County.

08:11.656 --> 08:13.407
And a key player
in Viet Dang Tin.

08:13.441 --> 08:17.244
It's an organization trying
to bring democracy to Vietnam.

08:17.278 --> 08:19.163
Didn't we already lose that war?

08:19.214 --> 08:21.281
Well, the democratic movement
wants to restore human rights

08:21.299 --> 08:22.967
to what they consider
an oppressive regime.

08:23.001 --> 08:24.335
So they would have good reason

08:24.386 --> 08:25.553
to discredit
the Vietnamese government.

08:25.587 --> 08:27.287
Cadeo's office is
in Garden Grove.

08:27.305 --> 08:28.756
On it.

08:28.790 --> 08:31.008
Any luck hunting
down that marine?

08:31.059 --> 08:33.309
First Lieutenant
James Cleary.

08:33.345 --> 08:34.794
SAM:
Looks like Saigon.

08:34.813 --> 08:36.462
Good eye.

08:36.481 --> 08:38.182
He served in Vietnam.

08:38.232 --> 08:39.850
He's a retired social worker,

08:39.900 --> 08:42.635
currently a guide
at Regent Gardens.

08:42.654 --> 08:44.822
How'd the kid in the hospital
get his name?

08:44.856 --> 08:48.108
I'm hoping
we can find that out now.

08:51.780 --> 08:54.248
Oh, my God.

08:54.282 --> 08:56.834
Was anyone hurt?

08:56.868 --> 08:59.920
Luckily, no.

09:01.173 --> 09:03.841
So, tell me,
how is it that your car came

09:03.875 --> 09:05.426
to be parked
outside the consulate

09:05.460 --> 09:07.878
with a bomb
inside of it?

09:07.929 --> 09:11.164
My car was stolen last night
while I was sleeping.

09:11.183 --> 09:13.551
Funny. There's no record
of that.

09:13.602 --> 09:16.470
I had to be in court
first thing, so I took a cab.

09:16.504 --> 09:18.305
My wife was going
to call the police.

09:18.339 --> 09:20.858
Except for the fact
that didn't happen.

09:20.892 --> 09:22.610
(sighs)

09:22.644 --> 09:25.229
Because my father fell
in the bathroom this morning.

09:25.280 --> 09:27.281
Convenient.

09:27.315 --> 09:29.233
He broke his hip.

09:32.037 --> 09:33.988
Sorry to hear
about that.

09:34.022 --> 09:36.156
(clears throat)

09:36.190 --> 09:38.075
Viet Dang Tin.

09:38.159 --> 09:39.376
How long have you, uh...

09:39.411 --> 09:40.794
How long have you
been with them?

09:40.829 --> 09:43.530
Ever since law school.
Seven years.

09:43.548 --> 09:45.799
You know, the FBI's
been keeping a close eye

09:45.834 --> 09:47.918
on that organization,
because they have been linked

09:47.969 --> 09:50.754
to several bombings
of Vietnamese embassies.

09:50.805 --> 09:52.223
Look familiar to you?

09:52.257 --> 09:54.258
London, 2000?

09:54.309 --> 09:56.710
Phnom Penh, 2001?

09:56.728 --> 09:58.929
That was a completely
different group--

09:58.980 --> 10:01.148
the Government
of Free Vietnam.

10:01.182 --> 10:04.568
They stopped
all terror activity in 2005.

10:04.603 --> 10:06.553
Our only weapons now
are social media

10:06.571 --> 10:09.690
and educational pamphlets,
not guns and bombs.

10:09.724 --> 10:11.158
We'll still have to check you

10:11.192 --> 10:12.743
and your home
for explosive residue.

10:12.777 --> 10:14.361
Be my guest.

10:14.395 --> 10:15.863
So, why have so many members

10:15.897 --> 10:17.831
of your organization
been arrested then?

10:17.866 --> 10:19.450
Because the Vietnamese
government suppresses

10:19.501 --> 10:21.068
freedom of expression
and assembly.

10:21.086 --> 10:23.370
If you speak out
or expose corruption,

10:23.404 --> 10:25.706
you end up in jail
for ten years.

10:25.740 --> 10:28.375
That is the kind of injustice
we try to expose.

10:28.409 --> 10:30.444
But of course,
never with car bombs.

10:34.466 --> 10:36.016
I think we were set up.

10:36.051 --> 10:37.134
And who would do that?

10:37.185 --> 10:38.552
Agents of the government

10:38.586 --> 10:40.721
who are trying to paint us
as terrorists.

10:40.755 --> 10:43.140
They'll do anything
to stop the democratic movement.

10:43.191 --> 10:46.093
They don't want an Asian Spring.

10:49.281 --> 10:51.932
That was a
lifetime ago.

10:51.950 --> 10:54.234
I did a 13-month tour

10:54.268 --> 10:56.487
as a platoon commander
and translator.

10:56.538 --> 10:58.238
You were
a translator?

10:58.272 --> 11:01.158
Uh-huh, studied
Vietnamese in college.

11:01.209 --> 11:02.876
After Officer
Candidate School,

11:02.911 --> 11:04.878
I was shipped
overseas.

11:04.913 --> 11:08.966
My battalion commander
took advantage of my skills.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.834
I interviewed the locals,

11:10.885 --> 11:12.920
got intel on
the enemy.

11:12.954 --> 11:15.288
So how'd this kid end up
with your name in his pocket?

11:15.307 --> 11:18.225
CLEARY: It's a close-
knit community.

11:18.259 --> 11:21.962
I translate at the free clinic
and for Meals on Wheels.

11:22.797 --> 11:26.133
He in the
garment industry?

11:26.151 --> 11:28.352
Hmm, someone may have
given him my name

11:28.403 --> 11:29.687
to help him plan
his escape.

11:29.738 --> 11:33.824
I also volunteer
for CAST.

11:33.858 --> 11:35.159
CAST?

11:35.193 --> 11:38.996
Coalition to Abolish Slavery
and Trafficking.

11:39.030 --> 11:40.331
Human trafficking.

11:40.365 --> 11:41.582
Mm-hmm.

11:41.616 --> 11:44.368
Poor villagers from
all over Asia are brought here

11:44.419 --> 11:47.287
with the promise
of a job, education.

11:47.321 --> 11:49.707
They end up working
long hours, no pay

11:49.758 --> 11:51.342
under terrible conditions.

11:51.376 --> 11:53.493
Why didn't he go to the police?

11:53.511 --> 11:55.295
Where he comes from,

11:55.329 --> 11:57.598
the police are as corrupt
as the traffickers.

11:57.632 --> 11:59.967
You check out
his workplace.

12:00.001 --> 12:01.719
If it's shady,
I can help you

12:01.770 --> 12:04.504
with shelter,
counseling, legal aid.

12:04.522 --> 12:05.939
Now, I got

12:05.974 --> 12:09.526
to lead the 1:00 tour.

12:09.561 --> 12:11.862
Thank you.

12:11.896 --> 12:13.647
Keep in touch.

12:13.681 --> 12:14.798
We will.

12:17.035 --> 12:19.036
Oh, folks,

12:19.070 --> 12:20.120
welcome to the garden.

12:20.155 --> 12:21.121
How are you?

12:21.156 --> 12:23.741
He seem a little off to you?

12:23.792 --> 12:25.959
Maybe.

12:25.994 --> 12:28.579
Like his mind
is somewhere else.

12:28.630 --> 12:31.582
Vietnam was 40 years ago.

12:31.633 --> 12:33.533
It takes a long time to heal.

12:33.585 --> 12:37.471
Maybe we stirred up
some memories.

12:39.057 --> 12:43.343
CLEARY: All right, why don't
we start over here?

12:43.377 --> 12:44.395
DEEKS:
Outside, down by two.

12:44.429 --> 12:46.897
What you got?
Oh!

12:46.931 --> 12:49.733
Not basketball,
it's, uh, netball.

12:49.768 --> 12:50.884
Netball--
is that the game

12:50.902 --> 12:52.352
where the girls wear
the tiny little skirts?

12:52.386 --> 12:53.570
Oh, that's the one.

12:53.605 --> 12:55.856
Maybe we should start
a netball team.

12:55.890 --> 12:57.441
Yeah, I'm in.

12:57.492 --> 12:59.392
Really?
Wait, really?

12:59.411 --> 13:01.158
Yes, if we all wear
the same uniform.

13:01.183 --> 13:01.912
Ugh,

13:01.913 --> 13:03.230
that just became
a terrible idea.

13:03.248 --> 13:04.448
Yeah.
Nell?

13:04.499 --> 13:07.251
Cadeo Hoang's organization
is squeaky clean.

13:07.285 --> 13:09.369
The U.S. ambassador to Vietnam
actually attested

13:09.403 --> 13:11.789
to their peaceful means.

13:12.740 --> 13:14.374
KENSI:
Okay, um,

13:14.408 --> 13:17.027
hospital photos.

13:17.762 --> 13:19.930
That is some
very interesting ink

13:19.964 --> 13:21.265
on Tuan's back.

13:21.299 --> 13:22.549
The boy
with the dragon tattoo.

13:22.583 --> 13:24.751
ERIC: Yeah, very similar
to the corporate logo

13:24.769 --> 13:26.920
of this free software
from the Web.

13:26.938 --> 13:29.940
Converts a standard keyboard
to Vietnamese characters.

13:29.974 --> 13:31.058
But the software
is embedded

13:31.092 --> 13:32.359
with a virus that's
been destroying

13:32.393 --> 13:33.944
the Vietnamese
democracy blogs,

13:33.978 --> 13:37.648
so maybe Tuan is
connected to the company.

13:37.699 --> 13:38.782
You think our kid has,

13:38.817 --> 13:40.600
uh, computer skills?
Or he works

13:40.618 --> 13:42.553
for someone who does.

13:43.121 --> 13:46.123
(glass shatters)

13:48.543 --> 13:50.610
When was the last time
you were on the court?

13:50.628 --> 13:54.715
I sang the national anthem with
my high school madrigal choir.

13:54.749 --> 13:56.467
DEEKS: Nothing beats a
great madrigal,

13:56.501 --> 13:59.570
except for not a madrigal.

14:01.005 --> 14:03.590
Do they wear skirts?

14:03.625 --> 14:05.142
OSHA compliance,

14:05.176 --> 14:09.096
Department of Labor wage
and hour certificates.

14:15.854 --> 14:17.571
Tuan's back to work already?

14:17.605 --> 14:20.023
I told you he was
a hard worker.

14:20.074 --> 14:22.242
He's feeling much better.

14:29.167 --> 14:31.585
Excuse me, please.

14:32.704 --> 14:34.338
I don't have time.

14:34.372 --> 14:35.873
Take care of it.

14:35.924 --> 14:38.041
You know
what to do.

14:44.382 --> 14:47.301
My husband Binh...

14:47.335 --> 14:49.520
he does not have a good
sense for business.

14:49.554 --> 14:50.554
(phone ringing)

14:50.588 --> 14:52.139
Hmm.

14:53.608 --> 14:54.641
Excuse me.

14:54.675 --> 14:57.311
Go ahead, Nell.

14:57.345 --> 14:58.345
What are you doing?

14:58.363 --> 15:00.280
(speaking Vietnamese)

15:00.315 --> 15:01.698
Huh?
(chuckles)

15:01.733 --> 15:02.983
(speaking Vietnamese)

15:03.017 --> 15:04.284
Okay.

15:04.319 --> 15:05.702
What?

15:05.737 --> 15:06.737
(chuckles)

15:06.788 --> 15:08.705
She wants to make you a present.

15:08.740 --> 15:09.623
She says

15:09.657 --> 15:12.125
a handsome man
like you deserves

15:12.160 --> 15:13.961
a nicer shirt.

15:13.995 --> 15:16.580
That's not necessary.

15:16.631 --> 15:18.198
Yeah, thank you.

15:18.216 --> 15:21.385
NELL: There's no surveillance video
on Yen's factory, but

15:21.419 --> 15:22.970
here's a juicy little tidbit.

15:23.004 --> 15:25.872
Checking tax records,
her garment output far exceeds

15:25.890 --> 15:27.540
the work of eight employees.

15:29.310 --> 15:30.761
We'll need a search warrant
for her home

15:30.812 --> 15:31.762
and business.

15:31.813 --> 15:34.514
Got it.
Thanks.

15:34.548 --> 15:35.766
<i>I don't think we've seen</i>

15:35.817 --> 15:37.517
the last of Yen.

15:37.551 --> 15:39.603
I'm gonna have to come back
and get my shirt.

15:39.654 --> 15:41.271
Your shirt?

15:41.322 --> 15:42.339
Yeah, sweet old lady.

15:42.373 --> 15:43.890
Maybe she works on commission.

15:47.362 --> 15:49.896
(grunts)

15:49.914 --> 15:52.032
(clattering)

15:54.619 --> 15:56.670
Why would they
be bringing

15:56.704 --> 15:59.406
racks of new clothes
into the building?

15:59.424 --> 16:01.925
That's like someone
delivering takeout

16:01.960 --> 16:04.695
to the back of your
favorite restaurant.

16:11.269 --> 16:13.887
(engine starts)

16:15.607 --> 16:17.557
No plates
in the front.

16:17.591 --> 16:19.759
Let's see where
this guy is going.

16:38.779 --> 16:41.498
Where the hell are we?

16:41.549 --> 16:44.801
City Terrace, East L.A.

16:50.758 --> 16:53.593
Thinking this
is a sweatshop?

16:53.627 --> 16:56.730
Yen's downtown factory
is just a front.

17:00.134 --> 17:02.135
(clears throat)

17:02.153 --> 17:04.771
(sighs)

17:04.805 --> 17:07.190
Can I help you?

17:07.241 --> 17:09.675
Looking for
the 10 Freeway.

17:17.952 --> 17:19.986
Make a left
on Eastern.

17:20.003 --> 17:22.155
Okay, thanks.

17:23.540 --> 17:25.509
(sighs)

17:25.511 --> 17:27.711
How many workers you
think they got inside.

17:27.762 --> 17:31.181
Enough that they need armed
guards to keep them in place.

17:31.215 --> 17:33.767
Or they've got
something else to hide.

17:43.887 --> 17:46.522
So LAPD gang unit
didn't recognize the ink.

17:46.556 --> 17:49.058
NELL: I'm working on the origin
of the computer virus.

17:49.076 --> 17:50.743
It's a secure Asian site,

17:50.778 --> 17:53.863
no traceable registration,
top secret.

17:53.897 --> 17:55.164
SAM:
Here's what we found.

17:55.199 --> 17:58.868
I'll take sweatshops
for $200.

17:58.902 --> 18:01.204
Could be a good place to hide
weapons and explosives.

18:01.238 --> 18:02.288
We discovered

18:02.339 --> 18:05.124
that Yen is a major donor
to Viet Dang Tin.

18:05.175 --> 18:06.426
That makes sense.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.878
A lot of Vietnamese business
owners are pro-democracy.

18:08.912 --> 18:10.246
They provide funding.

18:10.264 --> 18:11.714
Yeah, for a peaceful movement.

18:11.748 --> 18:13.249
But she could also
be bankrolling

18:13.267 --> 18:15.101
an under-the-radar
pro-democracy group

18:15.135 --> 18:17.270
willing to use bombs
to make their point.

18:17.354 --> 18:18.971
Maybe we should raid
the sweatshop.

18:19.022 --> 18:20.940
No, don't want to scare her off.

18:20.974 --> 18:21.974
If she's the money person,

18:22.025 --> 18:23.426
she'll lead us
to the terrorists.

18:23.444 --> 18:25.194
Anything new
from Immigration?

18:25.229 --> 18:27.280
Three years ago
Tuan arrived at LAX

18:27.314 --> 18:30.233
with others from
his village--

18:30.267 --> 18:32.318
Mai Nguyen and Hanh Phan.

18:32.369 --> 18:33.319
No criminal records.

18:33.370 --> 18:34.654
They came in on B-1 visas

18:34.705 --> 18:37.457
as domestic workers
of foreign nationals,

18:37.491 --> 18:39.125
but no one can find them now.

18:39.159 --> 18:41.577
Their I-94s had
bogus names

18:41.611 --> 18:44.997
and addresses
for their sponsoring "employer."

18:45.048 --> 18:46.332
Two more
trafficking victims.

18:46.383 --> 18:49.419
I wonder if Mai Nguyen
and the kid Tuan are related.

18:49.453 --> 18:51.137
That's a good thought,
Mr. Callen,

18:51.171 --> 18:53.473
but a bit of a long shot.

18:53.507 --> 18:56.959
Nguyen is the surname
of about 40%

18:56.977 --> 19:00.012
of the Vietnamese
population.

19:00.063 --> 19:03.266
We have less than 18 hours
till the conference.

19:03.300 --> 19:05.801
Do we want to evacuate
the consulate

19:05.819 --> 19:07.803
and the surrounding block?

19:07.821 --> 19:09.805
They could still try
to attack the diplomats

19:09.823 --> 19:11.858
at the hotel or airport.

19:11.909 --> 19:13.809
I think Yen is the key
to getting the terrorists.

19:13.827 --> 19:15.495
We're going back
to the factory.

19:17.614 --> 19:20.032
I'm gonna see
if Cleary wants to join us.

19:20.083 --> 19:23.002
Kensi, Deeks, keep a close eye
on her house-- Beverly Hills.

19:23.036 --> 19:25.938
That's where
I want to be.

19:26.874 --> 19:29.992
Fascinating tattoo.

19:30.010 --> 19:31.761
"The Dragon
and the Fairy."

19:31.795 --> 19:33.463
You know
what it means?

19:33.497 --> 19:35.848
It's the creation
myth of Vietnam.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.935
<i>A male descendent</i>
<i>of the dragons wed</i>

19:38.969 --> 19:42.722
a female descendent
of the fairies.

19:43.673 --> 19:46.609
She laid a hundred eggs

19:46.643 --> 19:49.512
which begat a hundred children.

19:49.530 --> 19:52.732
That's a fertile fairy.

19:52.783 --> 19:55.618
50 of the children went with
her to the northern highlands

19:55.652 --> 19:59.021
where they learned to breed
animals and grow fruit trees.

19:59.039 --> 20:01.690
The other 50 stayed
with the dragon

20:01.708 --> 20:04.210
to farm and fish
the lowlands.

20:04.244 --> 20:06.295
It's a metaphor
for national unity.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.697
Exactly, Mr. Callen.

20:08.715 --> 20:13.702
Even though the two Vietnams
seem apart and different,

20:13.720 --> 20:16.038
they share the same parents.

20:16.056 --> 20:17.706
Despite their separation,

20:17.724 --> 20:21.344
their bond
can never be broken.

20:21.378 --> 20:25.898
So a kid with the tattoo and a
company with a similar logo...

20:25.933 --> 20:27.517
Could be a coincidence.

20:27.551 --> 20:30.853
The image is very common
throughout the country.

20:30.887 --> 20:32.738
Exactly how do
you know all this?

20:32.773 --> 20:36.859
My first assignment out
of the academy was Saigon,

20:36.893 --> 20:39.362
1968, as an undercover
journalist.

20:39.396 --> 20:41.030
Really?

20:41.064 --> 20:43.249
Yes.
(opens drawer)

20:46.920 --> 20:49.672
(chuckles)

20:52.709 --> 20:53.960
Some time
I'll tell you

20:54.011 --> 20:57.413
about snake wine shots
with Ho Chi Minh.

21:04.187 --> 21:09.108
Qui, could you introduce
our other translator?

21:15.449 --> 21:18.100
He says he doesn't know me.

21:19.903 --> 21:23.456
You don't trust my translation
or you don't trust me?

21:23.490 --> 21:25.791
She's just checking his wounds.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.960
Mm-hmm.

21:29.046 --> 21:31.714
CALLEN:
You ever heard of anyone

21:31.748 --> 21:33.716
talking about attacking
the consulate?

21:33.750 --> 21:36.385
(speaking Vietnamese)

21:38.839 --> 21:40.806
(speaks Vietnamese)

21:40.841 --> 21:43.009
No.

21:43.060 --> 21:44.143
Why did you go there?

21:44.177 --> 21:46.729
(speaks Vietnamese)

21:47.631 --> 21:49.682
(speaks Vietnamese)

21:49.733 --> 21:52.251
He says he was being chased.

21:56.323 --> 21:58.858
Were you trying to escape
from your employer?

21:58.909 --> 22:00.860
(speaking
Vietnamese)

22:00.911 --> 22:03.112
(speaks Vietnamese)

22:03.146 --> 22:04.697
No.

22:04.748 --> 22:07.116
Do they pay you

22:07.167 --> 22:09.502
and treat you well?

22:10.837 --> 22:13.439
So, none of these guys
look familiar to you?

22:24.184 --> 22:27.136
Yes, but I don't think
he's telling you the truth.

22:27.170 --> 22:30.139
He's too afraid
of their threats.

22:30.173 --> 22:31.974
What kind of threats?

22:32.008 --> 22:34.226
Well, it's usually, "If you
talk, we'll kill your family

22:34.277 --> 22:35.845
back home."

22:35.879 --> 22:39.398
You all go now.

22:39.449 --> 22:40.683
Agent Hanna?

22:41.818 --> 22:42.985
Your shirt is ready.

22:43.019 --> 22:46.238
SAM:
Oh.

22:46.289 --> 22:47.239
Thank you.

22:47.290 --> 22:48.958
Wow, it's beautiful.

22:48.992 --> 22:51.527
I will wear it
with great respect.

22:53.413 --> 22:54.747
Go on.

22:54.798 --> 22:55.915
Try it on now.

22:55.966 --> 22:57.550
How much longer?

22:57.584 --> 22:59.335
CALLEN:
We're done.

22:59.369 --> 23:03.038
He couldn't identify
any of the gang suspects.

23:04.040 --> 23:05.708
Okay, we'll let you
get back to work.

23:05.726 --> 23:09.011
SAM:
Thank you.

23:09.045 --> 23:10.479
DEEKS:
Ten-foot jumper.

23:10.514 --> 23:12.682
(crowd noises)

23:12.716 --> 23:14.316
Guess there's money
in the shirt business, huh?

23:14.351 --> 23:17.069
Yeah, if you don't
pay your workers.

23:17.104 --> 23:18.070
Oh...

23:18.105 --> 23:19.238
(liquid splashes)
Oh!

23:19.272 --> 23:21.056
Are you kidding me?

23:21.074 --> 23:22.525
What, it's just a drop

23:22.559 --> 23:23.776
of pomegranate green tea.

23:23.827 --> 23:25.361
It's probably good
for your skin; here, I got it.

23:25.395 --> 23:27.530
No, I'm fine, I'm
good, Deeks, I'm good.

23:27.564 --> 23:28.948
Deeks, off.

23:29.899 --> 23:30.700
Hey, heads up.

23:30.734 --> 23:32.284
DEEKS:
Here we go.

23:32.335 --> 23:34.570
(shutter clicking)

23:35.422 --> 23:37.406
It looks like the housekeeper.

23:39.092 --> 23:41.910
Well, speaking
of housekeeping,

23:41.928 --> 23:44.046
clean up your balls.

23:46.099 --> 23:48.517
You're just mad 'cause
I left them all over your car.

23:48.552 --> 23:52.388
Please, they're not even
big enough to worry about.

23:54.307 --> 23:55.674
Excuse me?

23:55.709 --> 23:57.143
Excuse me, hi.

23:57.194 --> 23:58.778
I'm sorry,
I'm a little bit lost.

23:58.812 --> 24:00.896
Do you know where
the Beverly Center is?

24:00.930 --> 24:03.482
Sorry, no English.

24:03.533 --> 24:05.451
Oh, well...

24:35.565 --> 24:37.516
Did you want something?

24:37.567 --> 24:41.020
Yeah, I was looking
for a Vietnamese nanny.

24:41.071 --> 24:42.605
Why would you want
a Vietnamese nanny?

24:42.639 --> 24:44.139
Because my grandmother
was French.

24:44.157 --> 24:47.860
The French were not
kind to my country.

24:47.911 --> 24:49.745
Oh, well, you know,
she had a Vietnamese cook

24:49.780 --> 24:50.996
who made the most delicious pho

24:51.031 --> 24:52.998
and also a housekeeper
who was super hard working.

24:53.033 --> 24:55.251
She was so meticulous,
it was incredible.

24:55.285 --> 24:56.528
Do you happen to know
if someone's looking

24:56.553 --> 24:57.753
for a job, or...

24:58.421 --> 25:00.155
Try the agencies.

25:00.173 --> 25:01.490
Um, okay.

25:01.508 --> 25:03.759
- Is there anyone that you would recom...
- I don't know.

25:03.794 --> 25:04.794
(engine starts)

25:04.828 --> 25:06.328
Okay.

25:06.363 --> 25:08.280
Well, thank you.

25:12.502 --> 25:15.020
(shutter clicking)

25:15.055 --> 25:16.272
(exhales)

25:16.306 --> 25:18.006
Not the friendliest
of neighbors.

25:18.024 --> 25:20.509
Recognize
the housekeeper?

25:20.527 --> 25:21.610
Eric showed us her passport.

25:21.645 --> 25:23.279
That's Mai Nguyen.
Yeah.

25:23.313 --> 25:25.848
That's the villager
that came over with Tuan.

25:31.187 --> 25:33.389
They're keeping her
on a short leash.

25:34.291 --> 25:36.876
And I think
we know why.

25:52.202 --> 25:54.715
Are these the new
night vision binoculars?

25:54.716 --> 25:56.164
You boys doing
some camping?

25:56.165 --> 25:58.717
If we have to.

25:58.768 --> 26:00.168
Eric, I'm gonna need facial
recognition on everybody

26:00.186 --> 26:01.653
going in and out
of the sweatshop.

26:01.687 --> 26:02.687
You got it.

26:02.722 --> 26:03.838
Nice shirt.

26:03.856 --> 26:05.340
ERIC:
So, the Vietnamese Consulate

26:05.358 --> 26:07.225
is reporting new
e-mail threats.

26:07.276 --> 26:09.811
They appear to be from the
Viet Dang Tin, but they're not.

26:09.845 --> 26:11.012
NELL:
They also claim

26:11.030 --> 26:13.181
they'll attack
the conference tomorrow

26:13.199 --> 26:16.401
unless 27 pro-democracy
prisoners are freed in Hanoi.

26:16.452 --> 26:18.853
The messages originate from
the same secure Asian server

26:18.871 --> 26:21.189
that distributes
the computer virus.

26:21.207 --> 26:22.791
So, Viet Dang Tin
is being framed.

26:22.825 --> 26:24.492
FBI's got it all wrong;
they've got Cadeo

26:24.526 --> 26:26.328
and all his associates
under tight surveillance.

26:26.362 --> 26:27.862
While the real terrorists
lay the groundwork

26:27.880 --> 26:30.315
for an attack to discredit
the pro-democracy movement.

26:31.550 --> 26:32.717
Can you trace the e-mail?

26:32.752 --> 26:34.369
(groans)
It's crazy secure,

26:34.403 --> 26:36.338
but I've been known
to work a little magic.

26:36.372 --> 26:38.556
Yeah, can you saw a lady
in half?

26:38.591 --> 26:40.091
No, but I can make

26:40.142 --> 26:41.810
the Vietnamese Bureau
of Vital Statistics

26:41.844 --> 26:43.094
appear out of thin air.

26:43.145 --> 26:44.712
That's just as good.

26:44.730 --> 26:46.398
And look what we found.

26:46.432 --> 26:48.450
NELL:
It turns out the nanny,

26:48.484 --> 26:51.202
Mai Nguyen,
is actually Tuan's mother.

26:52.355 --> 26:54.439
So, she's overheard
conversations at Yen's house.

26:54.490 --> 26:55.723
SAM:
She probably knows

26:55.741 --> 26:57.609
about any bad guys who visit.

26:57.660 --> 26:59.327
We need to bring her
to the boatshed.

26:59.362 --> 27:02.163
Time to release the hounds.

27:07.186 --> 27:08.569
<i>Bonjour.</i>

27:08.587 --> 27:10.571
<i>Bon...</i>

27:18.931 --> 27:20.715
MAN:
Mai?

27:32.311 --> 27:33.928
(dog barking)

27:33.963 --> 27:35.113
Get off me!

27:36.482 --> 27:37.615
Stupid dog.

27:37.650 --> 27:39.701
DEEKS: Zeke, come on,
get back. Come here.

27:39.735 --> 27:40.819
I'm so sorry,
he got away from me, sir.

27:40.870 --> 27:42.237
(barking)
The leash actually broke.

27:42.271 --> 27:43.438
I'm so sorry.

27:43.456 --> 27:45.240
We were some special
Pavlovian training,

27:45.274 --> 27:46.607
and there's some sort
of movement in the underbrush.

27:46.625 --> 27:48.910
It was, like, a hedgehog,
maybe a rabbit.

27:48.944 --> 27:50.412
He started running after it.
I am so sorry.

27:50.446 --> 27:51.663
No, Monty, what are you doing
to the nice...

27:51.714 --> 27:53.548
No, no, oh...
Oh, blackhawk down.

27:53.582 --> 27:54.666
I'm so sorry, sir.

27:54.700 --> 27:57.085
(barking) Come on, Zeke,
sit down for a second.

27:57.119 --> 27:58.970
I'm not gonna tolerate
your insubordinance.

27:59.004 --> 27:59.971
Stop barking.

28:00.005 --> 28:01.622
Monty, I've got
kibble. Uh-oh.

28:01.640 --> 28:03.591
Oh, I just dropped it
all over your face.

28:03.625 --> 28:05.343
Monty, get away, or I'm
gonna pepper spray you.

28:05.394 --> 28:06.895
Get him off of me.
I'm trying, sir.

28:06.929 --> 28:08.346
Oh!
(screaming)

28:08.397 --> 28:10.782
Oh! That's my bad.
I'm so sorry, sir.

28:11.684 --> 28:13.435
That's completely
and totally my fault.

28:13.469 --> 28:14.635
Hey, an ice cream truck.

28:14.653 --> 28:16.471
That's gonna wear off;
you'll be fine.

28:16.489 --> 28:17.689
Monty, you want a
Fudgesicle, huh, Monty?

28:17.740 --> 28:19.023
Let's get. Fudgesicle.
Come on, get it.

28:19.074 --> 28:20.942
Come on, boy. Good
boy, all right. (coughing)

28:20.976 --> 28:23.445
<i>Let's go hit on some poodles.</i>

28:23.479 --> 28:24.996
MAI (over speaker):
For three years,

28:25.030 --> 28:29.501
I do not see my son
or talk to him.

28:29.535 --> 28:31.319
I sorry, my English...

28:31.337 --> 28:32.504
KENSI:
Oh, no, no, no.

28:32.538 --> 28:34.339
Your English is fine.

28:34.373 --> 28:36.508
They don't know I speak.

28:36.542 --> 28:38.159
I learned with little boy.

28:38.177 --> 28:42.380
Every day,
we watch <i>Sesame Street.</i>

28:42.431 --> 28:45.633
Elmo rocks.

28:45.667 --> 28:49.387
Sorry, I thought that we would
need you to translate here.

28:49.438 --> 28:51.139
Her English is limited.

28:51.173 --> 28:52.474
You still might.

28:52.508 --> 28:55.360
Do visitors ever come
to the house?

28:55.394 --> 28:57.011
Never.

28:57.029 --> 28:59.697
Husband and wife
do not like each other.

28:59.732 --> 29:02.734
He go out
every night, alone.

29:02.785 --> 29:04.685
Home at 2:00 in morning.

29:04.703 --> 29:06.354
I still cleaning.

29:06.372 --> 29:07.822
In the middle of the night?

29:07.857 --> 29:09.541
When do you sleep?

29:09.575 --> 29:11.643
Four hour is good.

29:19.218 --> 29:21.369
What happened here?

29:23.222 --> 29:26.007
If she does not like
my cooking or cleaning,

29:26.041 --> 29:28.476
she hit me.

29:28.511 --> 29:30.144
Every day.

29:30.179 --> 29:32.230
This has been
going on for years?

29:35.234 --> 29:37.352
Why didn't you ever run away?

29:37.386 --> 29:40.522
If I leave,
they say I go to jail.

29:40.556 --> 29:43.691
They say I...

29:43.725 --> 29:45.843
(speaks French)

29:47.729 --> 29:50.031
They told you you'd get raped?

29:50.065 --> 29:52.700
By police.

29:52.734 --> 29:54.919
They say if I tell anyone,

29:54.954 --> 29:57.738
they kill Tuan.

29:59.291 --> 30:02.877
Wow, nice boss.

30:02.911 --> 30:06.848
A hundred cases like
this every year in L.A.

30:06.882 --> 30:10.351
From Asia, South America,
Africa.

30:10.386 --> 30:11.752
This doesn't make any sense.

30:11.770 --> 30:13.421
I mean, Yen could afford
if she want...

30:13.439 --> 30:14.922
It's about power,

30:14.940 --> 30:16.757
not money.

30:16.775 --> 30:19.227
They haven't paid Mai a penny.

30:19.261 --> 30:21.229
She still has to work off
her airfare,

30:21.263 --> 30:24.432
her visa, her room, board,
clothing.

30:24.450 --> 30:26.484
She's a slave.

30:26.535 --> 30:27.986
Mm-hmm.

30:28.037 --> 30:30.054
And her son.

30:32.458 --> 30:33.741
(shutter clicking)

30:33.775 --> 30:36.444
CALLEN: Those two have been here
every day.

30:36.478 --> 30:39.380
How about pizza for dinner?

30:39.415 --> 30:41.833
(sighs) How about
something healthy?

30:41.884 --> 30:44.335
Okay.

30:44.386 --> 30:47.388
Sprouts on your half,
bacon on mine.

30:47.423 --> 30:50.291
I wonder what's
in the bags?

30:50.309 --> 30:53.344
A visit from a known terrorist
would be nice.

30:53.395 --> 30:55.847
Yeah, I'd settle for a delivery
of illegal weapons.

30:55.898 --> 30:57.982
You go live with the audio?

31:05.324 --> 31:08.076
Seriously?

31:15.584 --> 31:17.452
(mechanical whirring)
Mm.

31:17.486 --> 31:19.704
Sounds like a hundred mosquitoes
buzzing in my ear.

31:19.755 --> 31:22.206
I'd go crazy in there.

31:22.257 --> 31:23.458
(man shouting in Vietnamese)

31:23.492 --> 31:25.543
Ne help from the boatshed.
Hey, Deeks?

31:25.594 --> 31:26.628
What's up?

31:26.662 --> 31:28.379
Can you get Cleary on the line?

31:28.430 --> 31:30.214
He's on.

31:30.265 --> 31:31.766
Hey, Cleary?
It's the sweatshop.

31:31.800 --> 31:33.000
What are they shouting about?

31:33.018 --> 31:34.218
(men continue shouting
in Vietnamese)

31:34.269 --> 31:36.604
Uh, they're calling
them lazy, worthless,

31:36.639 --> 31:38.856
says they're not
working fast enough.

31:38.891 --> 31:40.558
(blows landing repeatedly)

31:40.609 --> 31:42.060
It sounds like a beating.

31:42.111 --> 31:43.844
Caning.

31:43.862 --> 31:45.730
They're asking Tuan
what he told the police.

31:45.781 --> 31:48.116
Tuan says nothing, but
they don't believe him.

31:48.150 --> 31:49.534
We got to go in.

31:49.568 --> 31:50.702
As soon as the guards exit.

31:50.736 --> 31:52.320
We don't need
any collateral damage.

31:52.354 --> 31:54.405
Oh, my God.
What?

31:54.456 --> 31:57.425
They-they're shouting,
"Help us."

31:57.459 --> 31:59.360
"Fire." They've
torched the place.

31:59.378 --> 32:01.796
I'm gonna notify city fire
of your location. Hold on, guys.

32:01.830 --> 32:03.081
We're on the move.

32:03.132 --> 32:05.199
(engine starts)

32:08.870 --> 32:10.988
(panicked shouting)

32:19.715 --> 32:21.983
(panicked shouting)

32:24.603 --> 32:26.738
One,

32:26.772 --> 32:29.273
two, three.
(screaming)

32:29.324 --> 32:30.858
Solid as a rock.

32:30.892 --> 32:32.994
We're better off trying
the door. Let's go.

32:34.396 --> 32:36.897
Stand back.

32:38.517 --> 32:40.034
It's reinforced steel.

32:40.068 --> 32:41.919
(explosion)

32:41.954 --> 32:43.904
(screaming, shouting)

32:43.922 --> 32:46.591
CALLEN:
Deeks?

32:46.625 --> 32:48.743
How are we doing on that ETA
for the fire department?

32:48.761 --> 32:50.094
Three to five minutes.

32:50.129 --> 32:51.412
That's too long.

32:52.598 --> 32:55.916
Get them away from the wall.

32:55.934 --> 32:57.135
Cleary, you still there?

32:57.186 --> 32:58.269
I'm here. I'm here.

32:58.303 --> 32:59.721
How do you say, "Move back"?

32:59.755 --> 33:00.855
(speaks Vietnamese)

33:00.889 --> 33:03.257
(shouting Vietnamese)

33:03.275 --> 33:04.726
Cleary, "Or you will die."

33:04.760 --> 33:06.277
(speaking Vietnamese)

33:06.311 --> 33:08.229
(shouting Vietnamese)

33:08.263 --> 33:10.815
(speaking Vietnamese)

33:12.768 --> 33:15.820
(tires squealing)

33:21.794 --> 33:24.162
Let's go! Out!

33:24.213 --> 33:26.214
Come on, everybody!
Go, go, go!

33:26.248 --> 33:27.498
Hurry up!

33:27.549 --> 33:29.116
Go, go, go!
Come on, come on, come on!

33:29.134 --> 33:30.618
Come on, come on!

33:30.636 --> 33:32.253
Let's go!
Come on!

33:32.287 --> 33:34.756
You good?
I'm good.

33:34.790 --> 33:37.058
Wish I could say the same
about your new shirt.

33:48.884 --> 33:50.822
Come on.
Come on.

33:53.433 --> 33:54.633
Gotcha!

33:55.809 --> 33:58.821
HETTY: Do I detect a note of
triumph in your voice, Mr. Beale?

33:58.846 --> 34:02.403
I, uh, cracked the encryption
and broke through the firewalls.

34:02.743 --> 34:06.288
We've got the IP address,
that launched the computer virus

34:06.313 --> 34:08.262
and the email threats
against the consulate.

34:11.614 --> 34:13.132
That's Yen's home address.

34:13.444 --> 34:15.478
She's funding the
pro-democracy movement.

34:15.513 --> 34:17.781
Why would she
try to destroy it?

34:17.815 --> 34:20.033
Maybe she didn't.

34:20.068 --> 34:21.235
I just got the results back

34:21.286 --> 34:23.237
on the swab Kensi took
from Binh's Porsche.

34:23.288 --> 34:25.855
It a direct match
to the consulate car bomb.

34:26.824 --> 34:28.292
Looks like Yen's husband's

34:28.326 --> 34:31.027
been playing with
some high-grade explosives.

34:31.045 --> 34:35.666
Perhaps he tired of his wife's
materialistic ways.

34:35.699 --> 34:37.251
Where is Sam and Callen?

34:37.302 --> 34:39.469
On the way to Yen's house
to arrest her.

34:39.504 --> 34:40.704
And Kensi and Deeks?

34:40.722 --> 34:42.255
Uh, five minutes closer.

34:48.429 --> 34:50.063
DEEKS:
Who do we got inside, Eric?

34:50.098 --> 34:52.382
ERIC:
I've got two on the exterior,

34:52.400 --> 34:54.234
and three inside.

34:54.268 --> 34:56.570
I suggest you wait
for Sam and Callen, Mr. Deeks.

34:56.603 --> 34:58.155
Will do.

34:59.524 --> 35:01.024
Gun!

35:01.058 --> 35:02.759
KENSI:
Federal agents!

35:04.028 --> 35:05.895
Scratch that,
we're taking fire.

35:06.748 --> 35:08.231
Go.

35:28.519 --> 35:30.871
We're clear out here.

35:31.940 --> 35:33.523
(gunshots)
Down.

35:39.981 --> 35:42.366
I think I just dinged a Ming.

35:45.320 --> 35:47.454
(gun cocking)
Go.

35:48.289 --> 35:49.389
Down!

35:52.943 --> 35:55.379
Okay. Plan?

35:55.413 --> 35:56.913
Well, I think we wait
until he reloads.

35:56.947 --> 35:58.448
Did you see the size
of the magazine.

36:02.787 --> 36:04.004
(Deeks groans)

36:04.055 --> 36:06.089
Okay. I'll pop up, I draw
his fire, you take him out.

36:06.123 --> 36:08.625
I guess, it's my turn
to get shot, right?

36:08.643 --> 36:09.626
Let's do it together.

36:09.644 --> 36:11.011
God, you talk pretty.

36:11.062 --> 36:13.580
BOTH:
One, two.

36:20.021 --> 36:21.488
Did you guys stop
for coffee?

36:21.522 --> 36:22.723
How many more?

36:22.757 --> 36:24.775
According to Eric, only
one, probably Binh.

36:24.809 --> 36:26.043
Take the perimeter,
we're going up.

36:26.077 --> 36:27.527
Yeah.

36:40.708 --> 36:42.209
I got Yen.

36:47.882 --> 36:49.633
She's dead.

36:56.808 --> 36:58.442
Got something.

37:09.237 --> 37:13.022
That's an interesting shoe rack.
RPG.

37:13.041 --> 37:15.525
RPGs.

37:17.128 --> 37:20.196
Could have been
one hell of an attack.

37:20.214 --> 37:21.665
(rustling)

37:21.699 --> 37:23.734
Balcony.

37:31.192 --> 37:32.993
Federal agents!
Drop your weapon!

37:34.078 --> 37:35.429
You heard the man!

37:36.681 --> 37:38.882
The pro-democracy movement
will be crushed.

37:38.900 --> 37:40.684
We can talk about it later.

37:40.718 --> 37:43.270
There will be no Asian Spring.

37:55.116 --> 37:58.067
Who knew we still had
one of these things?

37:58.086 --> 37:59.286
The office I tracked down

37:59.337 --> 38:02.089
in Cat Loi has filing cabinets,
not computers.

38:02.123 --> 38:05.292
The clerk had to walk a
mile to the nearest fax machine.

38:07.411 --> 38:09.078
So do we get Cleary
to translate?

38:09.097 --> 38:10.630
I don't think so.

38:10.681 --> 38:13.366
Callen needs to see this.

38:29.901 --> 38:31.368
Thank you.

38:32.770 --> 38:35.772
Thank you very much.

38:39.327 --> 38:43.580
One question never got answered.

38:43.614 --> 38:46.133
Why did Tuan really
have your name?

38:46.167 --> 38:50.837
Three year ago, I give it him
in case he ever in trouble.

38:50.888 --> 38:54.508
At home, all the old people
say this man,

38:54.559 --> 38:57.460
Cleary, he is hero.

38:57.478 --> 39:00.797
My unit liberated a few villages
in their province.

39:00.815 --> 39:02.399
I had no idea they were
still talking about it.

39:02.433 --> 39:05.735
Think there's a little bit more
to the story.

39:08.156 --> 39:09.439
You might want
to take a look at this.

39:09.473 --> 39:11.858
A birth certificate.

39:11.909 --> 39:14.861
It's Mai's birth certificate.

39:15.746 --> 39:18.615
You're listed
as her father.

39:18.649 --> 39:21.935
He is my father?

39:33.097 --> 39:36.550
So beautiful, Mai,

39:36.601 --> 39:38.501
just like your mother.

39:38.519 --> 39:41.805
She died long time ago.
I know.

39:41.839 --> 39:46.610
I knew my father
is American, but...

39:46.644 --> 39:47.861
Tuan...

39:53.901 --> 39:56.036
(speaking Vietnamese)

40:03.211 --> 40:06.463
He says I am the dragon,

40:06.497 --> 40:10.199
and his grandma
is the fairy.

40:10.218 --> 40:13.637
And now we are all
together again.

40:19.927 --> 40:22.279
CLEARY:
<i>Lanh was a school teacher.</i>

40:24.381 --> 40:28.685
I helped rebuild their village
after it was destroyed in '73.

40:28.719 --> 40:30.604
We were quite a team.

40:30.655 --> 40:32.889
Mai was born in '75.

40:32.907 --> 40:35.075
It was my second tour of duty.

40:35.109 --> 40:36.943
I was attached
to the Marine Security

40:36.994 --> 40:39.362
at the U.S. Embassy in Saigon.

40:39.397 --> 40:41.998
Bought Lanh a ring,

40:42.033 --> 40:45.752
found out she was pregnant
in April.

40:45.786 --> 40:47.504
It was the fall of Saigon.

40:47.538 --> 40:49.839
I was on one of the last
Hueys out.

40:49.874 --> 40:52.125
You flew to Task Force 76.

40:52.176 --> 40:53.510
Mm-hmm.

40:53.544 --> 40:55.378
Alone.

40:55.412 --> 40:57.764
I tried to keep in touch,

40:57.798 --> 41:00.684
send money,
but she was relocated.

41:00.718 --> 41:03.853
I knew the letters weren't
getting through.

41:03.888 --> 41:06.723
Years later, I had to move on.

41:06.757 --> 41:08.308
You got married?

41:09.259 --> 41:12.445
Kids, grandkids.

41:12.480 --> 41:14.331
Thank you.

41:16.767 --> 41:18.818
Not finding my Vietnamese family

41:18.869 --> 41:21.938
was the biggest regret
of my life.

41:24.608 --> 41:26.493
Trying to find them a shelter.

41:26.527 --> 41:27.744
No need.

41:27.778 --> 41:30.513
They're coming home with me.

41:37.271 --> 41:38.972
Top of the key, G.

41:39.006 --> 41:41.341
KENSI:
Let's go, let's go.

41:41.392 --> 41:43.843
(whistle blows)
Time-out.

41:43.894 --> 41:45.428
If this motley crew

41:45.462 --> 41:47.230
is going to play
an official game,

41:47.264 --> 41:49.015
you're going to need

41:49.066 --> 41:50.650
a proper referee.

41:50.685 --> 41:52.802
(chuckles)

41:55.856 --> 41:57.140
(whistle blows)
Time in!

41:57.158 --> 41:58.992
Let's go.
Check it up.

42:00.027 --> 42:01.328
Tag him up.

42:01.362 --> 42:03.430
What you got? What you got?

42:03.998 --> 42:05.582
(whistle blows)

42:05.616 --> 42:07.667
Offensive foul. Charging.

42:07.702 --> 42:09.119
- What?
- Hetty,

42:09.153 --> 42:10.453
he was still moving.

42:10.487 --> 42:12.956
Mr. Deeks was
in a set position.

42:12.990 --> 42:14.490
His feet were stationary,

42:14.508 --> 42:16.159
his arms were not

42:16.177 --> 42:17.761
in a downward motion.

42:17.795 --> 42:19.512
SAM:
No way.

42:19.547 --> 42:21.264
No way.
(whistle blows)

42:21.298 --> 42:23.350
Technical foul.
What?

42:23.384 --> 42:25.101
(laughing)

42:25.136 --> 42:27.437
Disrespectful communication
with the official.

42:27.471 --> 42:29.839
One free throw for Mr. Deeks,
Yeah.

42:29.857 --> 42:32.275
followed by his team's
possession.

42:32.309 --> 42:33.676
Hetty, how could it
be charging...

42:33.694 --> 42:36.012
Oh, careful, careful, Mr. Hanna.

42:36.030 --> 42:37.147
What did I do?

42:37.181 --> 42:39.649
Unsportsmanlike contact
with the official

42:39.683 --> 42:44.037
could lead to a disqualifying
foul and ejection.

42:44.071 --> 42:46.189
(laughs)

42:46.207 --> 42:48.191
Come on, Hetty,
you'd bench me?

42:48.209 --> 42:49.993
Don't make me kick your butt

42:50.027 --> 42:52.812
all the way to the locker room,
Mr. Hanna.

42:55.127 --> 42:57.787
<i>And don't you for one moment</i>
<i>think I wouldn't.</i>
