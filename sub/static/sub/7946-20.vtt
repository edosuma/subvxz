07:19.835 --> 07:21.500
eye contact with me?

07:21.542 --> 07:23.334
Uh, oh, because

07:23.335 --> 07:25.125
I just have one tiny

07:21.542 --> 07:25.125
question on the script.

07:25.167 --> 07:27.083
How do you pronounce

07:27.125 --> 07:30.459
these three pages?

07:30.500 --> 07:32.834
I can't believe you don't

07:32.835 --> 07:35.167
speak the language

07:30.500 --> 07:35.167
of the Bat Warriors!

07:35.209 --> 07:37.355
Have you even read

07:37.356 --> 07:39.500
the pronunciation index

07:35.209 --> 07:39.500
in book one?

07:39.542 --> 07:40.813
Uh, actually,

07:40.814 --> 07:42.083
since this job

07:39.542 --> 07:42.083
came up so fast,

07:42.125 --> 07:44.083

- any of the books.

07:44.125 --> 07:45.626
(ALL GASP)

07:45.667 --> 07:47.351
- Well, I wanted to read
- the first book on the plane,

07:47.375 --> 07:48.418
But it was too big

07:48.419 --> 07:49.459
to be a carry-on.

07:52.250 --> 07:54.147
Hey, why is Saturn

07:54.148 --> 07:56.042
the only planet with a ring?

07:56.083 --> 07:58.042
Mmm, I don't know.

07:58.083 --> 07:59.688
Maybe the other planets'

07:59.689 --> 08:01.292
boyfriends are afraid

07:58.083 --> 08:01.292
of commitment.

08:06.667 --> 08:09.250
What now, Bonnie?

08:09.292 --> 08:11.168
Oh, well, I guess

08:11.169 --> 08:13.042
we can say sayonara

08:09.292 --> 08:13.042
to that deal.

08:13.083 --> 08:15.042
- (PHONE BEEPS)
- What was that about?

08:15.083 --> 08:16.834
Uh, it's just...

08:16.876 --> 08:18.209
- If I'm not in
- Chicago tonight,

08:18.250 --> 08:19.876
- Then the deal
- might fall through

08:19.918 --> 08:21.189
And I could lose

08:21.190 --> 08:22.459
one or two hundred...

08:23.209 --> 08:24.584
Million.

08:25.626 --> 08:28.542
Anyway, hand me Venus.

08:28.584 --> 08:30.314
Mom, if you have to go,

08:30.315 --> 08:32.042
you should go.

08:32.082 --> 08:34.063
After all, with $200

08:34.063 --> 08:36.042
million you could buy

08:32.082 --> 08:36.042
me a real planet.

Oh, thank you, sweetie.

08:42.292 --> 08:43.438
And I promise

08:43.440 --> 08:44.584
I'll be back

08:42.292 --> 08:44.584
in time to help.

08:44.626 --> 08:45.897
Now, finish your

08:45.898 --> 08:47.167
grilled cheese.

08:47.209 --> 08:48.834
- I made it extra
- cheddar-y.

08:53.209 --> 08:54.500
Finished it!

Mmm, yum...

Emma, can I talk to you?

I need your help

09:21.250 --> 09:24.209
with my solar system.

09:24.250 --> 09:26.042
- Oh, I did that project
- three years ago.

there are 15 planets.

Okay, I definitely

09:35.022 --> 09:36.500
need Jessie.

09:36.542 --> 09:38.042
- Mom is leaving
- on business,

09:38.083 --> 09:39.626
- And I know
- she means well,

09:39.667 --> 09:40.855
But I also know

09:40.856 --> 09:42.042
she won't be

09:39.667 --> 09:42.042
back in time.

all the windows?

Yes, madam.

10:08.083 --> 10:09.185
- And make sure
- you do the outsides as well.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.251
The window washers

10:10.252 --> 10:11.292
always leave streaks.

10:11.334 --> 10:12.694
- Do you still
- have your harness?

10:14.083 --> 10:15.126
Yes, madam.

10:15.127 --> 10:16.167
And one more thing.

I can't do this anymore!

10:44.147 --> 10:46.125
I don't know that you're lazy?

10:46.167 --> 10:47.542
- In 10 years
- of working here,

10:47.584 --> 10:49.042
You've only gone

10:49.043 --> 10:50.500
through one sponge.

10:50.542 --> 10:51.793
I can't just toss

10:51.794 --> 10:53.042

10:55.667 --> 11:01.042
and I love you.

11:01.083 --> 11:02.459
Thank you, madam.

11:02.500 --> 11:05.042
Or should I say, Christy?

11:05.083 --> 11:06.230
Don't push it.

11:06.231 --> 11:07.375
Sorry.

11:07.417 --> 11:08.709
Now, before you

11:08.710 --> 11:10.000
go back into hibernation,

11:10.042 --> 11:11.209
please tell the pilot

11:11.210 --> 11:12.375
that I'm on my way

11:10.042 --> 11:12.375
to the airport.

11:12.417 --> 11:14.230
Yeah, about that.

11:14.231 --> 11:16.042
The kids took the jet to L.A.

11:12.417 --> 11:16.042
about an hour ago.

11:16.083 --> 11:17.834
- What?
- All by themselves?

11:17.876 --> 11:19.626
Why?

11:19.667 --> 11:21.021
I think they said something

11:21.022 --> 11:22.375
about Zuri needing Jessie's

11:19.667 --> 11:22.375
help on her project,

11:22.417 --> 11:24.250
but I'm not sure.

11:24.292 --> 11:26.417
If I paid attention

11:26.418 --> 11:28.542
to everything they said,

11:24.292 --> 11:28.542
I'd never get a nap in.

11:28.584 --> 11:30.584
But I promised Zuri

11:30.585 --> 11:32.584
that I'd be back to

11:28.584 --> 11:32.584
help her with that.

11:32.626 --> 11:33.626
Um...

11:35.083 --> 11:37.292
Permission to speak freely?

11:37.334 --> 11:38.481
Why not? You're already

11:38.482 --> 11:39.626
in your jammies.

11:41.542 --> 11:43.083
Well, it's just...

11:43.125 --> 11:44.584
It wouldn't be the first time

11:44.585 --> 11:46.042
you promised the kids

11:43.125 --> 11:46.042
you'd be there,

11:46.083 --> 11:47.209
and then you weren't.

11:48.334 --> 11:49.792
Okay, look, I know

11:49.793 --> 11:51.250
that I work a lot,

11:51.292 --> 11:52.376
but I want the kids to have

11:52.377 --> 11:53.459
everything they want.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.376
The penthouse,

11:55.377 --> 11:57.250
the jet, the ice-skating

11:53.500 --> 11:57.250
rink upstairs...

11:57.292 --> 11:58.939
Yeah. Thanks for that.

11:58.940 --> 12:00.584
Now I have to learn

11:57.292 --> 12:00.584
how to drive a Zamboni.

12:02.459 --> 12:04.855
Look, as much as the kids

12:04.856 --> 12:07.250
appreciate all those things,

12:07.292 --> 12:08.668
I think the thing

12:08.669 --> 12:10.042
they want most of all

12:07.292 --> 12:10.042
is their mother.

12:11.375 --> 12:13.022
Well, maybe

12:13.023 --> 12:14.667
you're right.

12:14.709 --> 12:16.168
Bertram, why didn't

12:16.169 --> 12:17.626
you tell me the kids

12:14.709 --> 12:17.626
were gone sooner?

12:17.667 --> 12:18.834
I was going to,

12:18.835 --> 12:20.000
but then I fell

12:17.667 --> 12:20.000
asleep in a closet.

all the blood - Rushes to our heads

12:31.667 --> 12:32.459

12:49.856 --> 12:50.959
it's a closed set.

12:53.148 --> 12:54.167

standing on your shoulders,

- would work.

abstain from sunlight,

are deer ticks and

14:36.042 --> 14:40.792
unemployment.

14:40.834 --> 14:42.167
Look, sir, this job

14:42.168 --> 14:43.500
means everything to me.

14:43.542 --> 14:45.064
I've been waiting

14:45.065 --> 14:46.584
for this break

14:43.542 --> 14:46.584
my whole life.

14:46.626 --> 14:48.334
But if those are my kids,

14:48.335 --> 14:50.042
I have to help them.

14:50.083 --> 14:51.313
If you walk out now,

14:51.314 --> 14:52.542
you're fired!

14:52.584 --> 14:54.334
(SCREAMING IN DISTANCE)

14:55.500 --> 14:57.126
(SIGHS)

14:57.127 --> 14:58.751
Then I guess I'm fired.

14:58.792 --> 15:00.709
- Jessie, where
- are my children?

15:00.751 --> 15:02.626
So, they are here.

15:02.667 --> 15:03.875
Help!

15:03.876 --> 15:05.083
Jessie!

15:05.125 --> 15:07.042
- Holy Hollywood!
- They're on the "H!"

15:07.083 --> 15:09.042
(SCREAMING CONTINUES)

15:09.083 --> 15:10.709
- And they're - about to fall!
- Oh!

15:11.792 --> 15:13.125
Jessie, help me!

15:13.167 --> 15:14.751
Someone help them!

15:14.792 --> 15:16.230
I've got it!

15:16.231 --> 15:17.667
A blue dragon

15:14.792 --> 15:17.667
swoops in,

15:17.709 --> 15:19.147
whisking them to safety

15:19.148 --> 15:20.584
on its armored wings!

15:21.918 --> 15:23.709
Yeah, this is real life.

15:23.751 --> 15:25.000
Then I got nothin'.

15:26.083 --> 15:27.334
I have to save them.

15:29.083 --> 15:30.083
(GASPS) Jessie's

15:30.084 --> 15:31.084
going to save us!

15:34.000 --> 15:35.314
Or she's really mad at us

15:35.315 --> 15:36.626
for interrupting her scene.

15:39.918 --> 15:40.918
LUKE: I got it.

15:44.292 --> 15:45.292
Hurry!

15:47.292 --> 15:48.668
Um, does this

15:48.669 --> 15:50.042
sort of thing happen a lot

15:47.292 --> 15:50.042
when I'm not around?

15:50.083 --> 15:51.542
Oh, hardly at all.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.083
- Maybe once,
- twice a week.

16:00.083 --> 16:01.959
Jessie, thank the gods!

16:03.375 --> 16:04.480
You're all gonna be okay.

16:04.481 --> 16:05.584
Nobody move.

16:06.250 --> 16:08.584
(ALL SCREAMING)

16:08.626 --> 16:10.146
- Scratch that,
- we have to move fast!

16:10.876 --> 16:12.751
(WAILING) What do we do?

16:12.792 --> 16:14.792
I don't want to die!

16:16.167 --> 16:18.000
Nobody's gonna die.

16:18.042 --> 16:19.481
We're all just going

16:19.482 --> 16:20.918
to take a fun ride

16:18.042 --> 16:20.918
down this zip line.

16:20.959 --> 16:22.335
Now, you need something

16:22.336 --> 16:23.709
to hold onto so you

16:20.959 --> 16:23.709
don't burn your hands.

16:23.751 --> 16:25.584
- Everyone take off
- your socks.

16:25.626 --> 16:27.375
Not you, Luke.

16:27.417 --> 16:28.605
Yeah, if he takes his

16:28.606 --> 16:29.792
socks off, we'll all be dead

16:27.417 --> 16:29.792
before we hit the ground.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.209
Okay, Zuri, you're first.

16:33.083 --> 16:35.042
- Come here.
- Got you.

16:36.709 --> 16:39.250
Jessie, I'm really scared.

16:39.292 --> 16:41.168
You're okay. Just close your

16:41.169 --> 16:43.042
eyes, and pretend you're

16:39.292 --> 16:43.042
holding onto Blake Shelton.

16:43.083 --> 16:44.083
Okay?

16:46.083 --> 16:48.667
ZURI: I've got you, Blake!

16:48.709 --> 16:50.188
RAVI: Too fast,

16:50.189 --> 16:51.667
too fast, too fast.

16:48.709 --> 16:51.667
Much too fast!

16:53.167 --> 16:55.709
Oh! My babies are safe!

17:01.083 --> 17:02.709
(APPLAUSE)

17:04.791 --> 17:06.730
Jessie, how can

17:06.731 --> 17:08.666
I ever thank you?

17:08.709 --> 17:10.666
- Make this
- a paid vacation?

17:11.834 --> 17:13.000
(LOUD CRASH)

17:17.917 --> 17:18.980
Congratulations, guys.

17:18.981 --> 17:20.041
You broke Hollywood.

17:21.876 --> 17:23.252
Miss Prescott,

17:23.252 --> 17:24.626
that was breathtaking!

17:24.666 --> 17:26.021
You are exactly

17:26.021 --> 17:27.375
what I'm looking for.

17:27.416 --> 17:29.250
Maternal, yet fierce.

17:29.292 --> 17:30.606
An earth mother

17:30.607 --> 17:31.918
who can also kick butt.

17:31.959 --> 17:33.459
Okay. (CHUCKLES)

17:33.500 --> 17:34.626
Men in Los Angeles

17:34.627 --> 17:35.751
have oddly specific

17:33.500 --> 17:35.751
taste in women.

17:36.834 --> 17:39.042
No, I mean

17:39.083 --> 17:41.583
I'm about to shoot

17:41.584 --> 17:44.083
a new TV show out here

17:39.083 --> 17:44.083
about a nanny by day,

17:44.125 --> 17:45.667
superhero by night.

17:45.709 --> 17:47.209
And I'm plucking

17:47.210 --> 17:48.709
you from obscurity

17:48.751 --> 17:49.855
to play

17:49.856 --> 17:50.959
the starring role!

17:51.000 --> 17:52.542
- (GASPS)
- What?

17:52.584 --> 17:53.959
Are you serious?

17:54.000 --> 17:55.522
Does a Wolf Walker

17:55.523 --> 17:57.042
hallucinate when it rains?

17:57.083 --> 17:58.042
I...

17:58.083 --> 17:59.459
- Yes.
- Oh, yeah!

18:01.083 --> 18:02.751
- I can't believe
- this is happening!

18:02.792 --> 18:03.876
Jessie, we're so

18:03.877 --> 18:04.959
happy for you!

18:02.792 --> 18:04.959
(CHUCKLES)

18:06.792 --> 18:08.709
Wait.

18:08.751 --> 18:09.876
But that means

18:09.877 --> 18:11.000
I wouldn't be able to be

18:08.751 --> 18:11.000
your nanny anymore.

18:12.876 --> 18:14.292
We know,

18:14.334 --> 18:15.417
and we'll really

18:15.418 --> 18:16.500
miss you.

18:16.542 --> 18:18.667
But this is your dream.

18:18.709 --> 18:20.855
And we don't want to get in

18:20.856 --> 18:23.000
the way of it coming true.

18:23.042 --> 18:24.560
- After everything you
- have done for us,

18:24.584 --> 18:25.688
This is our chance

18:25.689 --> 18:26.792
to do something for you.

18:29.083 --> 18:30.584
Christina?

18:30.626 --> 18:31.793
I've been doing

18:31.794 --> 18:32.959
a lot of thinking.

18:34.083 --> 18:35.563
And I really want to be

18:35.564 --> 18:37.042
there for you guys.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.083
So, from now on,

18:39.125 --> 18:41.000
- I'm going to be
- a stay-at-home mom.

18:41.042 --> 18:42.792
- You are?
- Really?

18:42.834 --> 18:44.042
Yeah. I'll be there

18:44.043 --> 18:45.250
every morning when

18:42.834 --> 18:45.250
you wake up,

18:45.292 --> 18:46.522
and every afternoon

18:46.523 --> 18:47.751
after school.

18:47.792 --> 18:48.792
Or, in Luke's case,

18:48.793 --> 18:49.793
detention.

18:49.834 --> 18:51.155
- I'm a real handful.
- (CHUCKLES)

18:53.083 --> 18:54.355
Don't worry, Jessie.

18:54.356 --> 18:55.626
We'll be okay.

18:56.083 --> 18:57.083
(SIGHS)

18:57.959 --> 19:00.042
I love you guys so much.

19:00.083 --> 19:02.584
Okay, I'll do it.

19:02.626 --> 19:03.876
"Ollywood," here I come!

19:05.083 --> 19:06.583
Uh, Mr. Robert

19:06.584 --> 19:08.083
R.J. Roberts, sir,

19:08.125 --> 19:09.918
since we are here,

19:09.959 --> 19:11.501
will you please tell us how

19:11.502 --> 19:13.042
the final book will end?

19:13.083 --> 19:14.501
Forgive me,

19:14.502 --> 19:15.918
my devoted disciples,

19:15.959 --> 19:17.647
but that would be

19:17.648 --> 19:19.334
a betrayal not only

19:15.959 --> 19:19.334
of my other fans,

19:19.375 --> 19:21.209
but of literature itself.

19:23.042 --> 19:24.667
We're cool with that.

19:24.709 --> 19:26.042
- Here's what
- should happen...

19:26.083 --> 19:27.938
Moira Machete defeats

19:27.939 --> 19:29.792
the Walkers and

19:26.083 --> 19:29.792
claims the scepter!

19:29.834 --> 19:31.792
- Then again,
- I'm a huge Machete-head.

19:31.834 --> 19:33.167
No!

19:33.209 --> 19:34.292
Sylvan should rise

19:34.293 --> 19:35.375
from the dead,

19:35.417 --> 19:36.522
mate with the Empress

19:36.523 --> 19:37.626
of the Wolf Walkers,

19:37.667 --> 19:39.230
and father a new race

19:39.231 --> 19:40.792
of Sky-wolves.

19:40.834 --> 19:42.022
Their mutant offspring

19:42.023 --> 19:43.209
would be invincible!

19:43.250 --> 19:44.667
(CHUCKLES)

19:44.709 --> 19:45.876
Wow, this stuff

19:45.877 --> 19:47.042
sounds great!

19:47.083 --> 19:48.480
I was just going to say

19:48.481 --> 19:49.876
it was all a dream.

19:49.918 --> 19:51.939
Uh, hey, while you're taking

19:51.940 --> 19:53.959
requests, can I make one?

19:54.000 --> 19:55.917
Could your new nanny

19:55.918 --> 19:57.834
show be called "Jessie?"

19:57.876 --> 19:59.500
- Not a chance.
- Worth a shot.

20:03.876 --> 20:05.834
- Zuri, the science fair
- was three days ago.

20:05.876 --> 20:07.042
- You can put
- that down now.

20:07.083 --> 20:08.042
I don't want to.

20:08.083 --> 20:10.063
(SNIFFING)

20:10.064 --> 20:12.042
It smells like victory.

20:12.083 --> 20:13.438
I am so proud of you,

20:13.439 --> 20:14.792
sweetheart.

20:14.834 --> 20:15.877
I couldn't have done it

20:15.878 --> 20:16.918
without you, Mom.

20:16.959 --> 20:18.501
You know, I have to admit,

20:18.502 --> 20:20.042
doing something

20:16.959 --> 20:20.042
with my own two hands

20:20.083 --> 20:21.375
was kind of thrilling.

20:21.417 --> 20:22.876
I think I have a callus!

20:24.876 --> 20:26.355
Uh, Bertram?

20:26.356 --> 20:27.834
Any chance you could

20:24.876 --> 20:27.834
help me take this to the limo?

20:27.876 --> 20:29.667
Oh, I would love to, but...

20:29.709 --> 20:31.709
ALL: It's so far.

Advertise your product or brand here

20:40.000 --> 20:42.375
- This has been the most amazing
- four years of my life.

20:44.083 --> 20:46.022
Christina, thank you so much

20:46.023 --> 20:47.959
for taking a chance on me.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.042
- I'm really going to
- miss your kids.

20:52.083 --> 20:53.083
Our kids.

21:00.584 --> 21:03.042
Bertram Winkle.

21:03.083 --> 21:05.042
- You may not be
- the best butler,

21:05.083 --> 21:06.105
But you are the best

21:06.106 --> 21:07.125
friend I've ever had.

21:07.918 --> 21:09.042
Ditto.

21:09.083 --> 21:10.626
- We made a
- pretty good team.

21:11.584 --> 21:13.042
The best.

21:15.167 --> 21:16.376
When you get famous

21:16.377 --> 21:17.584
enough to need a butler,

21:17.626 --> 21:19.209
and you will,

21:19.210 --> 21:20.792
give me a call.

21:20.834 --> 21:22.459
I will. And I will

21:22.460 --> 21:24.083
have a couch ready

21:20.834 --> 21:24.083
for you to nap on,

21:24.125 --> 21:26.046
- pre-stocked with plenty
- of cheese sandwiches.

21:26.083 --> 21:27.375
(CHUCKLES)

21:29.792 --> 21:31.272
Zuri, thanks for taking me

21:31.273 --> 21:32.751
in off the street.

21:34.709 --> 21:36.001
I can't believe

21:36.002 --> 21:37.292
you've grown from that

21:34.709 --> 21:37.292
adorable little girl

21:37.334 --> 21:38.438
into such a confident,

21:38.439 --> 21:39.542
amazing young woman.

21:39.584 --> 21:41.042
I can.

21:41.083 --> 21:43.000
- After all, - I had a great
- Role model.

21:55.083 --> 21:56.563
Luke, somehow

21:56.564 --> 21:58.042
when I wasn't looking,

21:55.083 --> 21:58.042
you grew up,

21:58.083 --> 21:59.542
and you are incredible.

21:59.584 --> 22:00.814
Now, still gonna work

22:00.815 --> 22:02.042
hard at school,

22:02.083 --> 22:04.044
- even when I'm - not here to bug you
- Every day?

22:04.083 --> 22:06.000
Of course, Jessie.

22:06.542 --> 22:07.918
Don't worry.

22:07.959 --> 22:09.751
I'll make you proud.

22:09.792 --> 22:11.042
I know you will.

22:15.083 --> 22:17.000
- I'll never wash
- this face again!

22:18.083 --> 22:19.876
Like you ever have.

22:22.083 --> 22:24.059
- Now, Ravi, you have to
- promise me something, too.

22:24.083 --> 22:25.792
I know, I know.

22:25.834 --> 22:27.439
I vow to find some friends

22:27.440 --> 22:29.042
and develop a modicum

22:25.834 --> 22:29.042
of athletic prowess.

22:29.083 --> 22:30.083
(CHUCKLES)

22:31.083 --> 22:33.125
No, actually,

22:33.167 --> 22:34.792
I was going to say that

22:34.793 --> 22:36.417
you are the kindest,

22:36.459 --> 22:38.438
smartest, most unique

22:38.439 --> 22:40.417
person I've ever met.

22:40.459 --> 22:41.751
You have to promise me

22:41.752 --> 22:43.042
you're not going to change

22:40.459 --> 22:43.042
for anyone.

22:43.083 --> 22:44.083
I promise.

22:47.876 --> 22:48.980
Oh, um, Mrs. Kipling

22:48.981 --> 22:50.083
has something for you.

22:50.125 --> 22:51.334
Oh.

22:53.500 --> 22:55.042
Thank you, Mrs. Kipling.

22:55.083 --> 22:56.042
(CROAKS)

22:56.083 --> 22:58.000
- And thank you
- for not eating me.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.083
Emma, are you okay?

23:06.459 --> 23:07.897
It's just that

23:07.898 --> 23:09.334
you'll be so far away.

23:10.709 --> 23:12.292
- I'm afraid
- you'll forget about us.

23:13.209 --> 23:14.918
Hey.

23:14.959 --> 23:16.210
Remember what I told you

23:16.211 --> 23:17.459
during your science project?

23:17.500 --> 23:18.751
About how family members

23:18.752 --> 23:20.000
are like planets?

23:20.959 --> 23:22.209
You said,

23:22.250 --> 23:23.397
"Even when

23:23.398 --> 23:24.542
they're far apart,

23:24.584 --> 23:25.584
"the force of love

23:25.585 --> 23:26.585
keeps them together.

23:27.500 --> 23:29.000
"No matter what."

23:30.083 --> 23:31.083
Right. (SNIFFLES)

23:31.125 --> 23:32.584
It stretches over

23:32.585 --> 23:34.042
any distance,

23:34.083 --> 23:35.524
- and it's too strong
- to be broken.

23:36.918 --> 23:38.709
- And I will
- never forget you.

23:44.542 --> 23:45.542
Come here.

23:51.292 --> 23:53.042
Jessie?

23:53.083 --> 23:54.167
I think it's time.

24:02.083 --> 24:03.292
(CLEARS THROAT)

24:11.042 --> 24:12.125
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

24:12.167 --> 24:13.876
CHRISTINA: Hey, Jessie...

24:13.918 --> 24:14.959
Any advice for me

24:14.960 --> 24:16.000
before you go?

24:19.083 --> 24:21.709
Just enjoy it.

24:21.751 --> 24:23.334
- It feels like
- a party every day.

24:30.417 --> 24:32.042
(CHUCKLES)

24:32.083 --> 24:34.000
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

24:36.542 --> 24:38.042
(DINGING CONTINUES)

24:48.751 --> 24:49.751
Hi, Jessie!

24:50.334 --> 24:51.751
Tony?

24:51.792 --> 24:53.751
- What are you
- doing here?

24:53.792 --> 24:55.292
I work here.

24:55.334 --> 24:56.974
- I had to drop out
- of the Fire Academy.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.022
Turns out,

24:58.023 --> 24:59.042
I'm allergic to smoke.

24:59.083 --> 25:00.334
Isn't everybody?

25:00.375 --> 25:02.209
Yeah, but I actually

25:02.210 --> 25:04.042
puked on the Dalmatian.

25:04.083 --> 25:06.126
Anywho, I heard they had

25:06.127 --> 25:08.167
a lot of big doors in

25:04.083 --> 25:08.167
L.A., so here I am.

25:08.209 --> 25:10.000
- (CHUCKLES)
- I'm so glad!

25:10.375 --> 25:11.834
Well,

25:11.876 --> 25:12.960
good luck on the first day

25:12.961 --> 25:14.042
of the rest of your life,

25:14.083 --> 25:15.542
you big star!

25:15.584 --> 25:17.042
Thanks, Tony.

25:17.083 --> 25:18.834
(HORN HONKING)

25:19.209 --> 25:20.834
ALL: Jessie!

25:20.876 --> 25:22.751
- Surprise!
- We came to wish you luck!

25:22.792 --> 25:24.584
- Although, if you miss me,
- I can stay!

25:26.042 --> 25:27.667
- How do you
- stop this thing?

25:27.709 --> 25:29.250
That is the accelerator!

25:29.292 --> 25:30.584
(ALL SCREAMING)

25:30.626 --> 25:32.000
- (LOUD THUD)
- (JESSIE SCREAMS)

25:34.626 --> 25:36.042
- Oh, my gosh!
- Jessie!

25:36.083 --> 25:37.083
Are you okay?

25:42.125 --> 25:44.042
- You're supposed to tell me
- to break a leg,

25:44.083 --> 25:45.250
Not actually do it.

25:47.083 --> 25:48.292
A little help?

25:48.334 --> 25:49.334
Always.
