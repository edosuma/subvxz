'What happened
to that amusement park'

'to make the rides
come to life after dark?'

02:16.559 --> 02:18.191
'Was it Old Man Weatherby'

02:18.193 --> 02:20.560
'the mysterious
swinging ship operator?'

02:20.562 --> 02:22.495
Or maybe kids playing a prank.

02:22.497 --> 02:26.200
Or maybe because of something
extra-terrestrial.

02:26.202 --> 02:28.167
'Alright, more would be
next week paranormals.'

02:28.169 --> 02:29.303
I gotta get to school.

02:29.305 --> 02:31.241
This is Daphne Blake
signing off.

02:32.741 --> 02:35.708
Aliens did not mess
with that theme park, Daphne.

02:35.710 --> 02:37.577
Uh, maybe they did, Velma,
we don't know.

02:37.579 --> 02:40.714
Um, statistically,
it's 100% more likely

02:40.716 --> 02:43.617
that a system malfunction
caused those rides to turn on.

02:43.619 --> 02:45.852
You know, for a girl who doesn't
believe in the paranormal

02:45.854 --> 02:47.754
you sure do keep up
with my posts about it.

02:47.756 --> 02:49.856
Yeah, well, somebody
has to debunk you.

02:49.858 --> 02:52.426
Plus, how else am I gonna
keep up with my internet BFF

02:52.428 --> 02:53.928
while she's jettin'
around the world?

02:53.930 --> 02:57.297
Where are you now, anyway?
Japan? Nigeria?

02:57.299 --> 02:58.531
Mars?

02:58.533 --> 03:00.368
Actually,
I have some exciting news.

03:00.370 --> 03:02.736
I know I've been
kind of cagey lately

03:02.738 --> 03:04.271
but I can finally tell you
I've been...

03:04.273 --> 03:05.905
Oh, about those prawn
and ketchup chips

03:05.907 --> 03:07.274
you sent me from Tokyo?

03:07.276 --> 03:09.542
They already arrived.
Tastes like gerbil.

03:09.544 --> 03:11.779
But in a good way.
You know what I mean?

03:11.781 --> 03:13.346
You know what
gerbil tastes like?

03:13.348 --> 03:14.780
- Don't worry about it.
- 'But no, no.'

03:14.782 --> 03:18.051
It's-it's not that.
This is way better.

03:18.053 --> 03:20.887
I'm in Ridge Valley! Ah!

03:20.889 --> 03:22.989
Ridge Valley?

03:22.991 --> 03:24.857
Like where I live Ridge Valley?

03:24.859 --> 03:27.727
Yeah, my mom got relocated and
I start at your school today.

03:27.729 --> 03:30.263
We can finally be
best friends IRL.

03:30.265 --> 03:32.632
- Oh.
- I thought you'd be excited.

03:32.634 --> 03:34.468
- It's just...
- Just what?

03:34.470 --> 03:37.271
Velma, you are my best friend.
This is awesome news.

03:37.273 --> 03:39.972
'Daphne, breakfast in 15.'

03:39.974 --> 03:44.778
Uh, I gotta go,
but I'll see you soon, I guess?

03:44.780 --> 03:47.079
See you soon.

03:56.993 --> 03:58.492
<i>Where the youth of today..</i>

03:58.494 --> 04:00.861
Oh, gosh.

04:00.863 --> 04:02.495
It's just high school.

04:02.497 --> 04:03.696
<i>Tobias Bloom..</i>

04:03.698 --> 04:05.565
Hey, turn on
my pump-up playlist.

04:07.568 --> 04:10.303
Mm-hmm. Turn up the beat.

04:12.174 --> 04:13.943
Alright, let's do this.

04:15.311 --> 04:16.944
What should I wear?

04:16.946 --> 04:19.012
I'm looking for the perfect
first day of school outfit.

04:19.014 --> 04:20.680
'Outfit complete.'

04:27.690 --> 04:29.089
Cute.

04:32.860 --> 04:36.464
Oh, please tell me
that's French toast I smell.

04:43.605 --> 04:46.774
- Good morning, mom.
- Good morning, sweetheart.

04:46.776 --> 04:48.508
Ha, I called it!

04:48.510 --> 04:50.377
- Morning, dad.
- Good morning, darling.

04:50.379 --> 04:51.812
Hm.

04:51.814 --> 04:54.914
So, mom, are you nervous
about your new job?

04:54.916 --> 04:57.216
I mean, I know your company
was a big deal

04:57.218 --> 05:00.921
but Bloom Innovative, wow!

05:00.923 --> 05:02.221
I'm so excited.

05:02.223 --> 05:05.659
I'm just so thrilled
to finally meet Tobias Bloom.

05:05.661 --> 05:07.928
Mm. Hashtag job goals.

05:10.733 --> 05:12.500
Is that not a thing anymore?

05:12.502 --> 05:14.668
- Not really.
- Oh!

05:17.139 --> 05:18.639
Note to self, hashtag's out.

05:18.641 --> 05:20.440
What about you, sweetheart?

05:20.442 --> 05:22.642
I mean, your first day
at a new school.

05:22.644 --> 05:24.945
I mean, high school to boot.

05:24.947 --> 05:27.981
- Are you nervous?
- Not really.

05:27.983 --> 05:32.519
I mean, if I can make it through
school in Argentina and Japan

05:32.521 --> 05:33.986
California
should be pretty easy.

05:33.988 --> 05:36.390
And there is no way
that Ridge Valley is any crazier

05:36.392 --> 05:38.724
than that school
in the middle of the Baltic Sea.

05:38.726 --> 05:40.993
Yeah, that school
was definitely not certified.

05:40.995 --> 05:42.563
You mean the principal
with the eye patch

05:42.565 --> 05:44.063
and the missing teeth
didn't tip you off?

05:44.065 --> 05:47.200
There was nothing wrong
with that school until it sank.

05:47.202 --> 05:49.570
What's this?

05:49.572 --> 05:52.906
Mm, those are the moons
of Saturn.

05:52.908 --> 05:53.875
Cool.

05:54.976 --> 05:57.043
Mm, pretty.

05:57.045 --> 06:00.346
Anyway,
school is gonna be awesome.

06:00.348 --> 06:02.551
Things always have a way
of working out.

06:07.755 --> 06:10.892
Hey, Velma, turn
that frown upside down.

06:13.295 --> 06:15.932
- Come on, Velma.
- Watch it.

06:17.399 --> 06:19.534
- 'Velma!'
- 'What's her problem?'

06:21.637 --> 06:24.570
- 'Oh, no.'
- 'Look where you're goin'.'

06:24.572 --> 06:27.043
Ah, my muffin.

06:30.211 --> 06:32.445
- 'Okay. Here you go, kiddo.'
- 'Great.'

06:32.447 --> 06:34.113
Thanks.

06:38.153 --> 06:39.586
It's gonna be great.

06:39.588 --> 06:42.089
It's gonna be awesome.

06:42.091 --> 06:43.526
'Velma.'

06:49.598 --> 06:51.565
Are you Daphne, the new girl?

06:51.567 --> 06:53.901
Yea. Is it that obvious
that I'm new here?

06:53.903 --> 06:56.402
Oh, not at all, I was already
e-mailed your full profile

06:56.404 --> 06:57.538
before you got here.

06:57.540 --> 06:59.740
Oh, wow, that's..

06:59.742 --> 07:02.308
I'm Carol, the senior advisor
at Ridge Valley High

07:02.310 --> 07:05.145
and I'm also the tour guide
for new students.

07:05.147 --> 07:07.046
- 'Heads up!'
- Ooh.

07:07.048 --> 07:08.548
No way.

07:08.550 --> 07:10.317
Legitimate Tulip,
they're my favorite band.

07:10.319 --> 07:12.086
Uh, okay, never heard of them.

07:12.088 --> 07:14.253
You almost just got
smacked in the face.

07:14.255 --> 07:15.721
- I did?
- Uh-huh.

07:15.723 --> 07:16.957
Oh!

07:16.959 --> 07:19.125
Guess I lucked out.
It's kind of my thing.

07:20.295 --> 07:21.428
Okay.

07:23.464 --> 07:26.733
'Welcome to another
beautiful day at Ridge Valley.'

07:26.735 --> 07:28.668
Wow, this is incredible.

07:28.670 --> 07:33.406
'Just a reminder,
it's World Appreciation Week.'

07:33.408 --> 07:36.543
- Hello, Daphne Blake.
- Hello.

07:36.545 --> 07:38.245
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Yeah.

07:38.247 --> 07:40.813
Since our school is sponsored
by Bloom Innovative

07:40.815 --> 07:43.883
we get to beta test
all of their latest inventions.

07:43.885 --> 07:47.620
Including the Azalea-9 phone.

07:47.622 --> 07:49.925
It's brand-new. So here.

07:53.262 --> 07:56.296
'Griffin Griffiths.
He's got blue eyes.'

07:56.298 --> 07:57.897
- 'He's 6'1".'
- 6'2".

07:57.899 --> 07:59.666
Thinks he's the cutest guy
in school.

07:59.668 --> 08:02.469
He's actually probably
the second cutest at best.

08:02.471 --> 08:04.637
- All yours.
- Thank you.

08:04.639 --> 08:06.673
Hey, you're the new girl, right?

08:06.675 --> 08:07.940
- Yeah.
- I'm Spencer.

08:07.942 --> 08:09.776
- 'Hey.'
- AKA the nicest guy ever.

08:09.778 --> 08:11.611
And basically,
the next Tobias Bloom.

08:11.613 --> 08:13.546
Total computer genius.

08:13.548 --> 08:16.517
And this is Mikayla.
She likes art.

08:16.519 --> 08:18.051
Wait, really, that's all I get?

08:18.053 --> 08:20.654
I'm Daphne.
I just moved here from..

08:20.656 --> 08:22.055
...well, all over.

08:22.057 --> 08:23.723
We travel a lot
for my mom's work.

08:23.725 --> 08:25.192
- She invented Matchmouth.
- Wait.

08:25.194 --> 08:28.195
- What?
- Your mom invented Matchmouth?

08:28.197 --> 08:31.063
That's so cool. I mean,
their use of dog-face filters

08:31.065 --> 08:34.000
for actual dogs
was revolutionary.

08:34.001 --> 08:35.568
I actually kind of helped her
come up with that one.

08:35.570 --> 08:37.504
- What?
- That's my favorite feature.

08:37.506 --> 08:39.472
That's so cool.
Isn't she so cool?

08:39.474 --> 08:41.573
You're, you're so cool.

08:41.576 --> 08:42.875
I'm actually glad
we ran into you guys.

08:42.876 --> 08:45.044
I was just about to show
Daphne the main event.

08:45.046 --> 08:47.246
This is the Bloom Bracket.
It's a real-time ranking

08:47.248 --> 08:50.183
'of all the underclassmen
at Ridge Valley.'

08:50.185 --> 08:53.819
You're scored on grades,
sports, extracurricular.

08:53.821 --> 08:55.923
'Even social media activity's
taken into account.'

08:55.925 --> 08:58.759
- It's like a GPA on steroids.
- Mm-hm.

08:58.761 --> 09:00.726
Wow. It sounds pretty intense.

09:00.728 --> 09:02.194
It is, but in a good way.

09:02.196 --> 09:03.962
At the end of each semester,
whoever is the top student

09:03.964 --> 09:06.665
of the Bloom Bracket gets an
internship at Bloom Innovative.

09:06.667 --> 09:09.568
Also known as the coolest place
on Earth.

09:09.570 --> 09:12.572
Can you guys imagine getting
to work for <i>the</i> Tobias Bloom?

09:12.574 --> 09:14.774
I mean,
I've got this perfect idea..

09:14.776 --> 09:16.208
Wait, let me pitch it to you.

09:16.210 --> 09:20.081
Okay. So imagine your phone
could make a pie.

09:21.916 --> 09:24.418
Uh, wait, that actually
sounds kind of weird.

09:24.420 --> 09:25.718
Slow down there, boy genius.

09:25.720 --> 09:27.053
Spencer here
is currently number one.

09:27.055 --> 09:28.455
'I think he's gonna win it all.'

09:28.457 --> 09:32.491
Boy genius? Can we age it up
to teen genius?

09:32.493 --> 09:34.626
- Hunky-man genius?
- Right.

09:34.628 --> 09:35.861
- Okay.
- Right.

09:35.863 --> 09:38.465
Suddenly,
I'm thinking baby genius.

09:38.467 --> 09:40.800
- Bye, guys.
- Hey, Velma!

09:40.802 --> 09:42.901
You can ignore her,
but you can't ignore me.

09:42.903 --> 09:45.941
- You know Velma?
- Yeah, we're friends.

09:47.776 --> 09:49.275
Velma has friends.

09:49.277 --> 09:51.611
You know, I think I'm actually
gonna go catch up with her.

09:51.613 --> 09:52.813
- So I'll see you later?
- Okay.

09:52.815 --> 09:55.050
- Bye, Daphne. Bye.
- Okay, bye.

09:56.785 --> 09:58.954
Velma has friends.

10:00.488 --> 10:01.620
Wow.

10:01.622 --> 10:03.792
Hey, Velma.

10:05.260 --> 10:06.996
Geez, it is her, right?

10:09.698 --> 10:11.767
'Match not found.'

10:14.770 --> 10:16.204
Velma, wait.

10:19.174 --> 10:21.140
I can't talk to you right now,
Daphne.

10:21.142 --> 10:23.543
So it is you. For a second,
I thought I was going crazy.

10:23.545 --> 10:26.646
You know your contact info
doesn't come up in the system?

10:26.648 --> 10:28.515
I know. I like it like that.

10:28.517 --> 10:30.583
Oh, okay.

10:30.585 --> 10:32.351
Well, do you wanna
get lunch later?

10:32.353 --> 10:34.453
We could tell everyone
about the curse of Crystal Cove.

10:34.455 --> 10:36.923
The blue-green aura was just
photosensitive plankton

10:36.925 --> 10:38.658
being disrupted
by boat propellers.

10:38.660 --> 10:40.559
Well, I still think
it was a ghost.

10:40.561 --> 10:43.098
The fire ghost. Boo! Argh!

10:44.499 --> 10:46.598
I can't have lunch with you,
Daphne.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.736
Not today, not ever.

10:48.738 --> 10:51.136
What? Why?

10:54.977 --> 10:56.643
My mop!

10:59.013 --> 11:00.947
Yikes! That's gotta hurt.

11:00.949 --> 11:04.250
- Yeah, I hope Velma's okay.
- No, I mean, that's gotta hurt.

11:07.522 --> 11:11.356
Ooh, cool. That
impressively fast editing.

11:11.358 --> 11:13.827
'I mean, she's already
in last place, but still..'

11:13.829 --> 11:17.697
- Wait, Velma's in last place?
- 'Yeah.'

11:17.699 --> 11:20.234
But she's so smart.
It's impossible.

11:22.503 --> 11:23.535
- See you later.
- Later.

11:23.537 --> 11:24.873
Bye.

11:31.545 --> 11:35.184
'Roman History
completed in record time.'

11:37.352 --> 11:39.954
I actually went to school
in Rome for a bit.

11:44.492 --> 11:46.462
Is that a California roll?

11:47.496 --> 11:49.398
I just saw it in the line.

11:51.166 --> 11:52.731
I can't believe you knew
all the moons of Saturn.

11:52.733 --> 11:54.500
Mr. Nussbaum
was totally blown away.

11:54.502 --> 11:56.470
Yeah, my parents have this
coffee-table book of Saturn

11:56.472 --> 11:58.971
that I flipped through
this morning. Total luck.

11:58.973 --> 12:00.506
You've gotta be my lab partner
tomorrow.

12:00.508 --> 12:02.576
You'll totally help me win
on the Bloom Bracket.

12:02.578 --> 12:04.144
- For sure.
- Sweet!

12:04.146 --> 12:05.779
- See you tomorrow.
- Alright, Daphne.

12:05.781 --> 12:06.880
See ya.

12:25.300 --> 12:26.600
Hello.

12:32.241 --> 12:33.375
Somebody there?

12:45.920 --> 12:47.654
Hello. Oh!

12:47.656 --> 12:49.422
- Velma!
- Daphne.

12:49.424 --> 12:51.223
Hi.

12:51.225 --> 12:54.793
I was just on my way
to a, um, sports match.

12:54.795 --> 12:57.867
Mm-hm, in the sports classroom.

12:58.867 --> 13:00.234
You mean the gym?

13:00.236 --> 13:03.035
What? Velma, w-what is with
all the lies?

13:03.037 --> 13:04.839
This isn't you.

13:08.877 --> 13:11.546
- Go home, Daphne.
- Why are you acting like this?

13:14.650 --> 13:17.183
Did you hear that?

13:17.185 --> 13:18.050
No.

13:18.052 --> 13:20.121
Hear what?

13:24.859 --> 13:26.559
It sounded like a ghost.

13:26.561 --> 13:29.428
Please, statistically, the
likelihood that ghost are real

13:29.430 --> 13:32.164
is somewhere
in the .0002% range.

13:32.166 --> 13:34.836
Okay, fine, but I think
we can agree on one thing.

13:36.104 --> 13:38.303
- 'Activating.'
- We need to investigate.

13:38.305 --> 13:41.340
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Velma.

13:41.342 --> 13:44.311
For one second, pretend you're
the friend I thought you are.

13:44.313 --> 13:45.481
Okay?

13:47.449 --> 13:48.881
Okay, but just to be clear

13:48.883 --> 13:50.750
we are not investigating
together, okay?

13:50.752 --> 13:52.986
You're investigating and I'm..

13:52.988 --> 13:56.392
...going to the sports match
in the sports classroom.

13:58.493 --> 14:01.095
Looks like someone's
possessing this place.

14:02.564 --> 14:05.300
More like the computer clips
shorted the circuits again.

14:09.905 --> 14:11.406
Do they do that too?

14:12.708 --> 14:14.308
- Spencer?
- Spencer?

14:26.854 --> 14:28.890
It's a secret passage.

14:32.761 --> 14:35.361
Dad! What are you doing here?

14:35.363 --> 14:37.764
Hey, honey.

14:37.766 --> 14:39.265
'I have a question.'

14:39.267 --> 14:42.202
Is, is my leg..

14:42.204 --> 14:44.540
...screaming
or is that just in my head?

14:48.542 --> 14:50.809
What are you doin' here?

14:50.811 --> 14:52.446
What are you doin' here?

14:52.448 --> 14:55.215
What does it look like?
I'm mopping.

14:55.217 --> 14:58.420
That's what they all say.

15:09.031 --> 15:10.797
Much better.

15:10.799 --> 15:13.433
Whoo. Wow, that's so funny.

15:13.435 --> 15:15.735
Me running into you at your
school. What a coincidence.

15:15.737 --> 15:19.039
Nedley, I think it's time
you're honest with our daughter.

15:19.041 --> 15:21.073
Yeah, dad,
why were you at my school?

15:21.075 --> 15:23.308
Well, I thought
I was supposed to pick you up.

15:23.310 --> 15:24.710
- Nedley.
- Elizabeth.

15:24.712 --> 15:26.115
Dad.

15:30.417 --> 15:32.585
- What?
- I was following you.

15:32.587 --> 15:34.154
What? Why?

15:34.156 --> 15:37.126
There is a reason
you think you're so lucky.

15:38.626 --> 15:41.126
I just felt awful about us
disrupting your life

15:41.128 --> 15:43.261
moving form city to city,
switching schools.

15:43.263 --> 15:44.831
That time you were four
and I lost you

15:44.833 --> 15:46.732
in that casino in Ibiza
for 36 hours.

15:46.734 --> 15:49.168
- You what?
- You know what, never mind.

15:49.170 --> 15:51.406
Look, I just..
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

15:53.340 --> 15:55.875
I so wanted your life
to be perfect

15:55.877 --> 15:59.245
that I, I made sure it is.

15:59.247 --> 16:02.450
Every first day of school,
every test, everything..

16:03.752 --> 16:04.984
...I was always there.

16:04.986 --> 16:07.089
Dad, what are you saying?

16:11.325 --> 16:14.226
You're not the luckiest girl
in the world, kiddo.

16:14.228 --> 16:17.230
Unless you consider me
your lucky charm.

16:17.232 --> 16:19.198
Turn on my pump-up playlist.

16:24.339 --> 16:26.709
Uh-huh, turn up the beat.

16:30.210 --> 16:32.413
Alright, let's do this.

16:36.318 --> 16:38.317
Please tell me
that's French toast I smell.

16:52.468 --> 16:55.434
Okay, but that's just at home,
right?

16:55.436 --> 16:57.837
And I'm also the
tour guide for new students.

16:57.839 --> 17:00.439
- 'Heads up.'
- No way.

17:00.441 --> 17:02.341
Legitimate Tulip,
they're my favorite band.

17:10.519 --> 17:11.752
Thanks, Dolores.

17:14.688 --> 17:16.623
Well, what about school
in Tokyo?

17:16.625 --> 17:20.224
I was translating everything
you said into Japanese.

17:20.227 --> 17:22.228
And your chopsticks
were secretly tiny forks.

17:22.230 --> 17:23.663
I designed those.

17:23.665 --> 17:25.231
What about the time
I scored a half-court shot

17:25.233 --> 17:27.000
at a basketball game
with my eyes closed?

17:27.002 --> 17:29.336
- That was real...
- Okay.

17:29.338 --> 17:31.537
...ly me disguised as a mascot.

17:31.539 --> 17:34.339
There were trampolines involved.
I'm so sorry, Daphne.

17:34.341 --> 17:35.875
Dad, how could you?

17:35.877 --> 17:38.010
You've literally sheltered me
my whole life.

17:38.012 --> 17:39.144
He was just trying
to protect you.

17:39.146 --> 17:40.812
I don't need protection, okay?

17:40.814 --> 17:42.481
I can handle myself.

17:42.483 --> 17:44.317
Now if you'll excuse me, I'm
gonna use my Clothe Me Closet

17:44.319 --> 17:46.722
to pick out my outfit
for tomorrow. Hmph!

17:53.992 --> 17:54.993
That was you, too, wasn't it?

17:54.995 --> 17:56.863
Four years
of Parsons School of Design.

17:56.865 --> 18:00.900
Okay, that's honestly
really impressive, but..

18:00.902 --> 18:02.371
Goodnight!

18:05.240 --> 18:07.205
Well, I-I-I thought
that went great.

18:50.685 --> 18:53.321
I guess I'm just on my own now.

19:33.427 --> 19:36.264
'Come closer.'

19:40.402 --> 19:42.838
Why can't you just stay out
of this, Daphne?

19:51.746 --> 19:53.112
Right.

19:53.114 --> 19:55.817
Guessing the violin serenade
every morning was my dad.

20:04.960 --> 20:07.492
Flying solo today. No problem.

20:07.494 --> 20:09.630
Pilots fly solo all the time.

20:10.932 --> 20:12.664
Wait. No, they don't.

20:12.666 --> 20:14.099
They, like, always
have co-pilots.

20:14.101 --> 20:16.470
It's one of the most basic
safety regulations.

20:18.839 --> 20:20.309
It's okay.

20:22.944 --> 20:24.413
You got this.

20:29.716 --> 20:31.585
'Nice outfit.'

20:31.587 --> 20:34.953
'She looked so
much cooler yesterday.'

20:34.955 --> 20:36.888
'Now she can
get rid of those shoes.'

20:38.193 --> 20:40.092
'Heads up, eggplant.'

20:49.037 --> 20:50.202
- Oh, sorry.
- Hey!

20:50.204 --> 20:52.338
- Oh, are you okay?
- Yeah.

20:52.340 --> 20:56.209
Oh, so plum and sage.
That's a bold color choice.

20:56.211 --> 20:58.743
Turns out my dad
was my Clothe Me Closet.

20:58.745 --> 20:59.779
Huh?

20:59.781 --> 21:01.346
And you probably
don't have one of those.

21:01.348 --> 21:02.647
I don't know what it is.

21:02.649 --> 21:05.017
But I do know,
uh, I can help you out.

21:05.019 --> 21:07.186
Uh, okay. Let's see here.

21:07.188 --> 21:09.087
Hold this

21:09.089 --> 21:12.692
and we will just do..

21:15.730 --> 21:17.129
...that. Ooh!

21:17.131 --> 21:19.365
Pink, cool.

21:19.367 --> 21:21.134
Pattern, okay,
we're getting there.

21:21.136 --> 21:22.201
- Oh, my gosh.
- And, uh..

21:22.203 --> 21:24.770
Oh, you love aliens.

21:24.772 --> 21:26.306
I love aliens.

21:26.308 --> 21:27.973
Well, it's yours to keep.

21:27.975 --> 21:29.741
Just feel free to incinerate
your other outfit.

21:29.743 --> 21:32.013
I will do that. Thank you.

21:46.327 --> 21:48.530
Oh! Sorry.

21:50.164 --> 21:52.634
- It's just water.
- Eww.

21:55.069 --> 21:57.369
Well, okay, students,
today is the day

21:57.371 --> 21:59.239
you've all been waiting for.

21:59.241 --> 22:02.508
We're gonna experiment with CO2.

22:02.510 --> 22:05.176
Find your lab partners.

22:05.178 --> 22:07.814
Hi,
thanks for joinin' us today.

22:07.816 --> 22:08.917
Sorry.

22:12.753 --> 22:15.320
Hey, Spence,
you still wanna be lab partners?

22:15.322 --> 22:17.455
I'm good.

22:17.457 --> 22:19.058
- Are you okay?
- Hm?

22:19.060 --> 22:20.158
I saw you at the lockers.

22:20.160 --> 22:23.328
You seem kind of... off.

22:23.330 --> 22:25.664
- He's fine.
- I'm good.

22:25.666 --> 22:27.165
But he's my lab partner.

22:27.167 --> 22:30.103
So move along.

22:30.105 --> 22:33.405
- You sure, Spence?
- Yeah, I'm good. Yeah.

22:33.407 --> 22:36.808
- Right, you said that.
- I'm good.

22:36.810 --> 22:38.310
Okay.

22:38.312 --> 22:40.748
- Spence.
- Hm. Huh?

22:44.051 --> 22:46.751
Hey, what's going on
with Spencer?

22:46.753 --> 22:49.289
He just ditched me
to work with Griffin.

22:49.291 --> 22:51.456
He's acting really strange.

22:51.458 --> 22:52.491
I think
something happened to him

22:52.493 --> 22:53.792
after we lost him last night.

22:53.794 --> 22:55.528
Or maybe
he doesn't wanna talk to you.

22:55.530 --> 22:57.129
Kind of like
how I don't wanna talk to you.

22:57.131 --> 23:00.866
Seriously? Now you're tryin'
to fight with me?

23:00.868 --> 23:03.038
There is something wrong
with him.

23:04.338 --> 23:05.770
Hm.

23:05.772 --> 23:07.473
Oh, God.

23:07.475 --> 23:08.775
We're the only people
who saw him go

23:08.777 --> 23:11.443
into that possessed locker
last night.

23:11.445 --> 23:13.246
Plus, I have this recording.

23:13.248 --> 23:14.847
Fine. He's acting weird, okay.

23:14.849 --> 23:16.648
What are we supposed
to do about it?

23:16.650 --> 23:18.718
Better to stay out of it.

23:18.720 --> 23:20.818
Yeah, I guess you don't care
about anyone.

23:20.820 --> 23:23.689
Enough of the chatting,
Daphne, Velma.

23:23.691 --> 23:26.224
Are you two gonna be
lab partners or not?

23:26.226 --> 23:27.727
- Yes.
- No.

23:27.729 --> 23:30.997
- Yes, we are.
- Right.

23:30.999 --> 23:32.965
Let me handle this.

23:32.967 --> 23:35.137
Of course, who cares
about teamwork, right?

23:37.839 --> 23:39.771
- 'Whoa!'
- 'What just happened?'

23:39.773 --> 23:41.507
'I'm good.'

23:48.014 --> 23:49.917
What did you
just put in here?

23:51.284 --> 23:53.118
It's expanding too fast.

23:53.120 --> 23:55.523
- You're sabotaging our project.
- Prove it.

23:59.560 --> 24:01.594
That's it.
This is the worst day ever!

24:01.596 --> 24:03.229
Why are you doing this to me?

24:03.231 --> 24:06.464
You're the one
who won't leave me alone!

24:06.466 --> 24:08.000
Seriously?

24:08.002 --> 24:10.670
And what? You can't wear
the same headband

24:10.672 --> 24:12.437
for more than an hour?

24:12.439 --> 24:14.839
Oh, Carol said it clashed.

24:14.841 --> 24:16.741
And Carol's always right.

24:16.743 --> 24:19.412
Daphne, Velma, enough!

24:19.414 --> 24:20.547
Hm. I'm good.

24:20.549 --> 24:23.248
- Ahem.
- I'm good.

24:23.250 --> 24:25.218
What's wrong with him?

24:25.220 --> 24:27.086
Well,
thanks for cleanin' up, girls.

24:27.088 --> 24:29.355
But I gotta tell ya,
this isn't how I planned

24:29.357 --> 24:30.690
on startin' my Tuesday.

24:30.692 --> 24:34.192
I planned
on havin' a fancy yogurt.

24:34.194 --> 24:35.493
That's my me time.

24:35.495 --> 24:36.996
- Sorry, Principal Piper.
- Sorry.

24:36.998 --> 24:39.565
Well, just make
yourself comfortable, girls.

24:39.567 --> 24:42.233
Tobias Bloom
has said on his blog

24:42.235 --> 24:45.971
that this is the best couch
for conflict resolution.

24:45.973 --> 24:47.008
'So..'

24:48.775 --> 24:51.443
...let's make him proud, girls.
Make him proud.

24:51.445 --> 24:54.079
Hmm. Oh, sorry, where were we?

24:54.081 --> 24:58.951
You two were fighting
in chemistry class.

24:58.953 --> 25:02.154
I'd like to hear you apologize
to each other. Both of you, go!

25:02.156 --> 25:04.757
Me? She's the one
who sabotaged our project.

25:04.759 --> 25:06.259
She's lying. I don't know
what she's talking about.

25:06.261 --> 25:08.161
Oh, just like you forgot
that you're supposed to be

25:08.163 --> 25:09.962
my best friend?

25:09.964 --> 25:11.797
I'm sorry, Principal Piper.

25:11.799 --> 25:13.331
I thought I could handle
high school myself

25:13.333 --> 25:15.600
but it turns out I can't.

25:15.602 --> 25:16.836
Here I am
in the principal's office.

25:16.838 --> 25:18.837
My science project is ruined
and..

25:18.839 --> 25:22.040
Did you know they give out
grades lower than an A?

25:22.042 --> 25:25.243
- Yes, of-of course, I did.
- That's pretty standard.

25:25.245 --> 25:28.247
Well, I didn't know that
because I've never gotten one.

25:28.249 --> 25:29.781
Pretty soon,
they're gonna be telling me

25:29.783 --> 25:31.250
that there's no caviar
in the cafeteria.

25:31.252 --> 25:34.287
- Actually, there isn't and...
- Just leave it.

25:34.289 --> 25:37.723
Daphne, you had wonderful
recommendations

25:37.725 --> 25:39.191
from all your prior schools.

25:39.193 --> 25:41.993
I'm sure that
you're gonna find your way here.

25:41.995 --> 25:46.198
But you, Velma,
I am very disappointed in you.

25:46.200 --> 25:49.004
- Sorry, Aunt Piper.
- You're related?

25:50.271 --> 25:51.703
Oh, yes. I see it.

25:51.705 --> 25:54.240
Before high school,
you were such a straight A

25:54.242 --> 25:56.075
superstar student.

25:56.077 --> 25:57.009
You were?

25:57.011 --> 25:58.544
I knew it.

25:58.546 --> 26:02.717
I don't know what's gotten into
you, but it needs to change.

26:04.485 --> 26:07.420
- Timothy Bot!
- Here I am.

26:07.422 --> 26:09.855
Let's engage the conflict couch.

26:09.857 --> 26:11.956
Conflict couch engaged.

26:11.958 --> 26:14.326
It's still in beta-testing,
but don't worry, girls.

26:14.328 --> 26:15.927
Since it's the first time
for all of us

26:15.929 --> 26:17.529
we won't do anything
too extreme.

26:17.531 --> 26:19.432
Extreme bout activated.

26:19.434 --> 26:20.866
No, no, wait, I didn't say that.

26:20.868 --> 26:23.368
- Extreme bout locked.
- Stop!

26:23.370 --> 26:24.837
- Turn it off.
- 'Oh!'

26:24.839 --> 26:26.806
You just hang in there
and try and work this out.

26:26.808 --> 26:29.808
- 'I'm gonna fix this.'
- 'Now ordering 50 tacos.'

26:29.810 --> 26:32.044
Oh, no. no, Timothy Bot.
No. Bad! Bad boy.

26:32.046 --> 26:34.312
'Calling my bad boy.'

26:34.314 --> 26:36.080
Where's the real Velma

26:36.082 --> 26:37.916
the straight A
superstar student?

26:37.918 --> 26:39.285
'Friendship detected.'

26:39.287 --> 26:41.788
Just forget
what Aunt Piper said. Drop it.

26:41.790 --> 26:43.689
- 'Conflict.'
- No!

26:43.691 --> 26:45.958
- 'Conflict.'
- Drop it.

26:45.960 --> 26:48.193
Why are you acting like this?

26:48.195 --> 26:50.596
It's to protect you, okay?
It's for your own good.

26:50.598 --> 26:52.731
Protect me.
I can protect myself, thank you.

26:52.733 --> 26:55.067
- Can you, really, Daphne?
- Yes, I can.

26:55.069 --> 26:58.738
Oh, I'm Daphne. I want some
caviar from the cafeteria.

26:58.740 --> 27:02.141
Oh, wait. They don't have caviar
in the cafeteria.

27:02.143 --> 27:04.544
I'm Velma, I have four heads
and I'm dark and brooding

27:04.546 --> 27:05.778
and I don't like
to talk to people

27:05.780 --> 27:07.480
so I have no contact
in the system.

27:07.482 --> 27:10.583
- Maybe I like it that way.
- Well, you're on my hair.

27:10.585 --> 27:13.919
- You're on my hair.
- Well, you're spitting at me.

27:13.921 --> 27:17.392
Well, sorry.
That was an accident.

27:22.496 --> 27:24.231
Forget what Carol said.

27:25.265 --> 27:28.099
Purple and green
go awesome together.

27:28.101 --> 27:29.970
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:31.271 --> 27:33.006
Thanks.

27:33.008 --> 27:35.907
- I'm sorry, Daphne.
- 'Friendship detected.'

27:35.909 --> 27:37.878
I really am your friend.

27:38.980 --> 27:42.014
- It's just..
- 'Resolved.'

27:42.016 --> 27:43.347
Just what?

27:43.349 --> 27:46.152
Let me help. We're a team.

27:46.154 --> 27:48.453
Something weird is happening
to the top students here.

27:48.455 --> 27:49.888
Like what happened to Spencer?

27:49.890 --> 27:51.956
It happened to another girl.
Olivia.

27:51.958 --> 27:53.959
Before you got here,
she was a world-class violinist

27:53.961 --> 27:56.128
and-and now
she can't even play a note.

27:56.130 --> 27:57.896
And it's been happening
for a while.

27:57.898 --> 28:00.298
I mean, parents just think
it's teens being teens

28:00.300 --> 28:02.401
but I don't think so.

28:02.403 --> 28:04.769
I mean, why is it only happening
to the top students?

28:04.771 --> 28:06.204
We have to investigate.

28:06.206 --> 28:08.507
We have to help
Spencer and Olivia.

28:08.509 --> 28:09.975
Well, that's the thing.

28:09.977 --> 28:11.309
If whoever is behind this
finds out

28:11.311 --> 28:12.912
two internet sleuths
are on their trail

28:12.914 --> 28:15.080
then this could get dangerous.

28:15.082 --> 28:18.183
Who cares?
We have to take a risk.

28:18.185 --> 28:21.519
- Actually, no, I don't.
- 'Conflict.'

28:21.521 --> 28:22.921
- Yeah, you do.
- 'Conflict.'

28:22.923 --> 28:24.056
Because I'm not budging.

28:24.058 --> 28:26.224
And if you keep
disagreeing with me

28:26.226 --> 28:29.063
this weird couch is gonna ram us
together for all of eternity.

28:31.299 --> 28:32.464
Fine.

28:32.466 --> 28:35.134
But only because
I don't want a concussion.

28:35.136 --> 28:37.169
So you're in?

28:37.171 --> 28:40.275
- Yeah. I'm in.
- 'Complete.'

28:41.743 --> 28:43.375
Velma totally sucks, by the way.

28:43.377 --> 28:44.844
'Conflict detected.'

28:44.846 --> 28:47.179
Well, I just ordered 2000 rolls

28:47.181 --> 28:50.581
of toilet paper and now I know
all the movie show times

28:50.583 --> 28:51.884
for Cheyenne, Wyoming

28:51.886 --> 28:55.119
but I think he's finally fixed.

28:55.121 --> 28:56.555
Hey, you two made up.

28:56.557 --> 29:00.358
- Yeah, we're friends again.
- Thanks, Aunt P.

29:00.360 --> 29:01.860
You rule. High five.

29:01.862 --> 29:04.129
Posting album
bikini photos to Facebook.

29:04.131 --> 29:06.465
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no.

29:06.467 --> 29:07.933
He's kidding. He's kidding.

29:07.935 --> 29:10.036
He's kidding. Gotta go.
Bad Timothy.

29:10.038 --> 29:13.338
So, um, seeing as you're
senior advisor and everything

29:13.340 --> 29:15.106
we were hoping
you could help us out.

29:15.108 --> 29:16.642
Totally.

29:16.644 --> 29:19.345
But, um..

29:19.347 --> 29:21.513
Are you sure you
should be hanging out with her?

29:21.515 --> 29:22.948
I mean, her below record scores

29:22.950 --> 29:25.250
are, like,
practically non-existent.

29:25.252 --> 29:28.054
I can hear you.

29:28.056 --> 29:31.356
- This is a very small table.
- Oh.

29:31.358 --> 29:34.993
- Sorry. Hi.
- So about Spencer?

29:34.995 --> 29:36.729
Right. You said
he's been acting weird.

29:36.731 --> 29:38.396
So weird.
You guys noticed too?

29:38.398 --> 29:40.031
'The dude's
like a walking thesaurus.'

29:40.033 --> 29:42.902
Now he has, like, two words
in his vocabulary.

29:42.904 --> 29:44.871
Hm. Uh, no, I'm good.

29:44.873 --> 29:47.041
Well, have you checked
his Bloomgram?

29:50.377 --> 29:52.912
"So much fun working in the lab
after school."

29:52.914 --> 29:54.249
Science guy emoji.

29:55.381 --> 29:58.049
I mean, it's a little nerdy,
I guess, but..

29:58.051 --> 29:59.352
...I don't know,
it seems normal to me.

29:59.354 --> 30:01.953
It's weird.
It sounds like Spencer.

30:01.955 --> 30:04.455
But he's so not acting okay.

30:04.457 --> 30:07.092
And look at his Bloom Bracket
score. It's totally dropping.

30:07.094 --> 30:09.927
Competition just gets
to some kids, you know?

30:09.929 --> 30:12.096
Well, unless you're one
of the Griffiths.

30:12.098 --> 30:14.398
- You mean Griffin Griffiths?
- Yeah.

30:14.400 --> 30:16.902
I mean, his whole family
is like crazy talented.

30:16.904 --> 30:18.636
His older brothers
and sisters have won

30:18.638 --> 30:21.639
the Bloom Bracket competition
three years in a row.

30:21.641 --> 30:24.042
We need to talk..

30:24.044 --> 30:25.245
...in private.

30:28.482 --> 30:30.848
- That's your cue to leave.
- Oh.

30:33.419 --> 30:35.019
We're working on the whole
manners thing still.

30:35.021 --> 30:36.388
- No, we're not.
- Yes, we are.

30:36.390 --> 30:38.891
It's fine.
I'm gonna get a salad, anyways.

30:38.893 --> 30:41.993
- We'll see you guys later.
- 'Wanted to eat my salad.'

30:43.864 --> 30:45.596
Spencer just sent out a snap.

30:48.469 --> 30:50.068
So weird.

30:50.070 --> 30:52.206
I mean, he looks happy
in the photo, but..

30:53.973 --> 30:56.109
Huh? No. I'm good.

30:57.310 --> 30:58.378
Mm.

31:00.080 --> 31:02.646
Something weird
is definitely going on.

31:02.648 --> 31:05.017
We need to bust into that locker
that Spencer walked through

31:05.019 --> 31:06.585
to find the secret passage.

31:06.587 --> 31:10.021
Or build enough
that we could do something

31:10.023 --> 31:12.657
that won't lead
to certain danger.

31:12.659 --> 31:14.595
- Just an idea.
- Velma.

31:16.097 --> 31:19.397
Fine.
We'll come up with something.

31:19.399 --> 31:20.400
Thanks.

31:22.069 --> 31:24.970
Huh? Mm. Yes.

31:24.972 --> 31:28.673
Sorry, little guy.
You were a good robot.

31:28.675 --> 31:30.375
But your time has come.

31:30.377 --> 31:31.943
I really wish
I hadn't programmed you

31:31.945 --> 31:33.346
with human emotions.

31:33.348 --> 31:34.913
Velma?

31:34.915 --> 31:36.548
Please don't.

31:36.550 --> 31:37.583
'Don't!'

31:38.953 --> 31:42.257
Hey, pumpkin.
How's my favorite redhead?

31:43.689 --> 31:45.924
Hi, mom. Working late?

31:45.926 --> 31:47.692
Yeah, things are already crazy.

31:47.694 --> 31:50.895
Tobias Bloom wants me to import
all of Matchmouth's tech

31:50.897 --> 31:52.731
onto his servers ASAP.

31:52.733 --> 31:55.166
- The man never stops.
- So you finally met him?

31:55.168 --> 31:56.567
Does a video conference call

31:56.569 --> 31:58.703
with 12 Norwegian investors
count?

31:58.705 --> 32:00.739
I think he might have said
nice to meet you

32:00.741 --> 32:02.875
or was it pleased to fire you?

32:02.877 --> 32:05.010
You know what?
Don't overthink it.

32:05.012 --> 32:06.644
That's great advice.
Don't overthink it.

32:06.646 --> 32:09.214
- You're so smart.
- 'Uh, but exciting news.'

32:09.216 --> 32:10.616
You'll get to meet him tomorrow.

32:10.618 --> 32:12.183
He's coming
to Ridge Valley High

32:12.185 --> 32:14.452
to introduce his latest
top-secret project.

32:14.454 --> 32:15.287
Sweet.

32:15.289 --> 32:16.821
Hey, uh, speaking of school

32:16.823 --> 32:18.624
how was school?

32:18.626 --> 32:20.692
Well, I got into a fight
with Velma, flunked

32:20.694 --> 32:22.728
my science project and ended up
at the principal's office.

32:22.730 --> 32:25.397
But all in all,
I think it went pretty well

32:25.399 --> 32:26.798
considering it was my first day

32:26.800 --> 32:29.000
actually going to school
by myself.

32:29.002 --> 32:32.304
You know, I-I can fire up
the Clothe Me Closet

32:32.306 --> 32:34.639
in, like, five minutes.

32:34.641 --> 32:35.808
- Mom?
- What?

32:35.810 --> 32:38.610
- I'm on it.
- What? No, honey. I'm sorry.

32:38.612 --> 32:40.077
You look..

32:40.079 --> 32:41.480
I can't even say it.

32:41.482 --> 32:43.615
- She looks terrible.
- Oh.

32:43.617 --> 32:46.183
'Students,
report to Bloom Innovative's'

32:46.185 --> 32:47.519
'beta presentation.'

32:47.521 --> 32:51.523
Welcome to this month's
Bloom Innovative

32:51.525 --> 32:53.325
beta presentation.

32:53.327 --> 32:55.327
We have to sneak out of here
while no one's looking.

32:55.329 --> 32:58.396
Now we all remember the last
time where we learned about

32:58.398 --> 33:01.733
the Bloom Innovative
sound buds.

33:01.735 --> 33:05.337
These brilliant ear pods
create a soundtrack

33:05.339 --> 33:07.940
that is personalized to you.

33:07.942 --> 33:09.974
Oh, I'm doing the "Running Man"

33:09.976 --> 33:11.176
'cause I'm running
to the future.

33:11.178 --> 33:12.944
I can't wait to see what's next.

33:12.946 --> 33:15.681
Without further ado, here he is

33:15.683 --> 33:18.916
Tobias Bloom!

33:20.987 --> 33:23.757
Hello!
Hello, Ridge Valley High!

33:29.163 --> 33:31.396
So familiar in person.

33:31.398 --> 33:34.333
Probably because his face is
plastered all over the school.

33:34.335 --> 33:36.301
'Boy, do I have an exciting'

33:36.303 --> 33:38.002
new innovation
to beta test with you today.

33:38.004 --> 33:42.473
But first, an important matter
of business to attend to.

33:42.475 --> 33:45.713
It's time that we check in
on my Bloom Bracket.

33:47.380 --> 33:51.185
I hear there's a new student
on top of the rankings.

33:54.989 --> 33:56.989
Griffin Griffiths.

34:07.335 --> 34:09.469
Should have been Spencer
up there.

34:11.605 --> 34:14.340
Huh? Hm. I'm good.

34:14.342 --> 34:18.378
But for now my latest invention.

34:21.782 --> 34:23.251
A 3D printer.

34:24.284 --> 34:27.119
- 'Lame.'
- Lame. I know.

34:27.121 --> 34:29.855
We have them
in every single classroom.

34:29.857 --> 34:32.958
But what if I told you
that this printer..

34:32.960 --> 34:35.159
...was for food.

34:37.498 --> 34:39.730
Bloom Print,
I'd like a slice of pizza.

34:48.942 --> 34:50.143
No way.

34:55.148 --> 34:57.016
On second thought, Bloom Print

34:57.018 --> 35:00.684
print me off enough pizza
for the entire school.

35:03.456 --> 35:06.391
He's done it again!
He's done it again!

35:06.393 --> 35:08.226
- Pizza, pizza, pizza!
- Pizza, pizza, pizza...

35:08.228 --> 35:10.228
Daphne, no one's looking.
Let's go.

35:10.230 --> 35:12.597
- What about pizza?
- Daphne, let's go.

35:12.599 --> 35:15.934
Pizza, pizza, pizza, pizza!

35:15.936 --> 35:17.635
The only person
that would come out here

35:17.637 --> 35:20.472
during a Bloom presentation
is Two-Mop Maggie.

35:20.474 --> 35:23.007
And I've already
taken care of her.

35:23.009 --> 35:25.811
Well, like, taken care of?

35:25.813 --> 35:28.614
No, I mean, I spilled some juice
a couple hallways over.

35:28.616 --> 35:30.382
- Oh.
- And it's not mean.

35:30.384 --> 35:32.386
Maggie loves spills.

35:34.020 --> 35:36.922
This robot engine
is totally stable.

35:36.924 --> 35:38.690
Unless it's overheated.

35:38.692 --> 35:41.427
And this is the stuff
they put in heating pads.

35:41.429 --> 35:44.362
But amped up. Way up!

35:44.364 --> 35:46.697
And it's your signature color.

35:46.699 --> 35:49.333
'What? I have an eye
for these things.'

35:49.335 --> 35:51.171
I call it..

35:52.072 --> 35:53.739
...a melting engine.

35:53.741 --> 35:55.572
We can come up
with something better than that.

35:55.574 --> 35:57.474
Okay, when you destroy
your robot child

35:57.476 --> 35:59.143
you can name the thing, okay?

35:59.145 --> 36:00.744
Okay.

36:03.083 --> 36:06.117
Velma, did you see that?

36:06.119 --> 36:07.619
See what?
I'm, I'm kind of busy here.

36:07.621 --> 36:10.489
This is my first time
violating school property, so..

36:10.491 --> 36:12.693
And here we go.

36:15.596 --> 36:18.998
Oh, it's working.
It's really working.

36:27.107 --> 36:28.509
Whoa.

36:32.279 --> 36:34.415
There's no secret passage.

36:39.587 --> 36:42.855
- It's just a blue ribbon.
- Great. Trash.

36:42.857 --> 36:45.625
Recycling. I don't know
if this school's super green.

36:47.060 --> 36:48.994
Wait, no. Remember Olivia?

36:48.996 --> 36:51.496
The music prodigy who fell off
the face of the Earth?

36:51.498 --> 36:53.364
I mean, she's like Spencer now

36:53.366 --> 36:58.135
but she used to always wear
a ribbon in her hair.

36:58.137 --> 37:00.972
How many girls do you know
who wear ribbons in their hair?

37:00.974 --> 37:03.074
Those girls in the 1940s.

37:03.076 --> 37:04.943
- And me.
- Exactly.

37:04.945 --> 37:08.614
- Because ghosts don't exist.
- Wait, that's...

37:08.616 --> 37:10.382
Okay, Daphne,
you're missing the point.

37:10.384 --> 37:12.083
This is Olivia's ribbon.

37:12.085 --> 37:14.722
Which means Olivia went through
the secret passage too.

37:16.322 --> 37:18.458
- Yes, a clue!
- Whoa.

37:23.998 --> 37:26.565
Yesterday a fight in class.

37:26.567 --> 37:27.601
Today..

37:29.902 --> 37:32.269
"...melting a locker?"

37:32.271 --> 37:34.938
That is not a good trend.

37:34.940 --> 37:36.840
Principal Piper,
if you'll just let us explain.

37:36.842 --> 37:38.744
We were trying to help
our friend Spencer. He's not...

37:38.746 --> 37:41.646
I, I can't believe
it's come to this.

37:41.648 --> 37:44.952
But... I'm gonna have
to give you girls..

37:47.020 --> 37:48.353
...shame stickers.

37:50.290 --> 37:51.492
Take 'em.

37:56.362 --> 37:58.864
'Great. Great. Good.'

37:58.866 --> 38:00.898
How do you feel?

38:00.900 --> 38:02.800
Exactly the same.

38:04.270 --> 38:05.637
- But shamed.
- Yeah.

38:05.639 --> 38:07.038
- So ashamed.
- Yeah, good.

38:07.040 --> 38:09.074
- Really ashamed.
- Good, good, good, good.

38:09.076 --> 38:12.009
I really think those stickers
will do the trick

38:12.011 --> 38:15.246
and some kitchen duty.

38:15.248 --> 38:17.047
'Kitchen duty
in shame stickers'

38:17.049 --> 38:21.119
guaranteed to stop girls
from blowin' things up.

38:21.121 --> 38:22.290
Right?

38:23.324 --> 38:24.592
Yeah.

38:30.529 --> 38:32.730
What's up, lunch ladies?

38:32.732 --> 38:34.965
Ooh, I'll take a scoop
of the messier one.

38:34.967 --> 38:36.400
Ooh, nice.

38:36.402 --> 38:40.704
How 'bout two scoops for your
new Bloom Bracket leader?

38:40.706 --> 38:43.173
You're only on top of the
Bloom Bracket because Spencer...

38:43.175 --> 38:44.342
Isn't feeling well.

38:44.344 --> 38:46.143
You mean, because he tanked.

38:46.145 --> 38:49.681
What can I say? I guess being
<i>numero uno</i> runs in the family.

38:49.683 --> 38:52.150
- And I'm next.
- Okay.

38:52.152 --> 38:53.985
Are you jealous
or something?

38:53.987 --> 38:56.855
- You're ranked, like, 200th.
- Oh.

38:56.857 --> 38:59.523
- Tss. Burn.
- That's not a joke, guys.

38:59.525 --> 39:00.724
Just stating facts.

39:00.726 --> 39:02.360
I was just trying
to be supportive.

39:02.362 --> 39:04.065
- 'Y-yeah, we're good friends.'
- 'Yeah.'

39:06.398 --> 39:07.798
- We're really close.
- Yeah.

39:07.800 --> 39:09.936
Well, I guess he got
what he wanted.

39:12.306 --> 39:14.572
- Wait, that's it.
- What?

39:14.574 --> 39:16.407
Being the lamest group of guys
on Earth?

39:16.409 --> 39:18.610
No, think about it.

39:18.612 --> 39:20.244
Who wanted to be on top
of the Bloom Bracket

39:20.246 --> 39:21.813
more than anybody?

39:21.815 --> 39:24.916
Who has a family legacy
to protect?

39:24.918 --> 39:26.951
Griffin Griffiths.

39:28.654 --> 39:32.592
'Look at him. The so-called
second cutest boy in school.'

39:34.061 --> 39:35.726
Wow.

39:35.728 --> 39:37.929
You really think so?

39:37.931 --> 39:40.264
Um, sure.

39:40.266 --> 39:42.567
That is so nice.

39:42.569 --> 39:44.902
Do you wanna go out sometime?

39:44.904 --> 39:46.771
No. Not really.

39:46.773 --> 39:49.241
I'm not looking
for anything serious, you know?

39:49.243 --> 39:52.143
- It's not you. It's me.
- Oh.

39:52.145 --> 39:55.280
- I'm just gonna..
- 'Yeah, yeah, j-just go.'

39:55.282 --> 39:57.414
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay.

39:57.416 --> 39:58.684
He does seem nice.

39:58.686 --> 40:00.184
- Okay, let's stay focused.
- Right.

40:00.186 --> 40:02.688
Griffin. Okay,
he has to be behind this.

40:02.690 --> 40:03.954
He has the motive
to want something bad

40:03.956 --> 40:05.724
to happen to Spencer.
We have to stop him.

40:05.726 --> 40:08.192
No, wait, wait, wait.
First, we need intel.

40:08.194 --> 40:09.527
We don't have time.

40:09.529 --> 40:11.228
We have to do this fast,
low-tech.

40:11.230 --> 40:12.597
Daphne, we have to make a plan

40:12.599 --> 40:14.366
otherwise we're just puttin'
ourselves in danger.

40:14.368 --> 40:16.871
Live wild, V.
We have to go for it.

40:19.139 --> 40:21.075
Hey, look, over there.

40:22.009 --> 40:23.241
'No.'

40:23.243 --> 40:25.177
Coach Williams, don't do it.

40:25.179 --> 40:26.146
What?

40:28.681 --> 40:30.014
- Oh, he didn't.
- No.

40:30.016 --> 40:32.650
- Oh, he's doin' it again.
- V, not that.

40:32.652 --> 40:34.053
'Beside him.'

40:36.156 --> 40:38.757
I have a plan.

40:38.759 --> 40:40.391
- Daphne.
- 'What?'

40:40.393 --> 40:41.960
- Hairnet.
- 'Right.'

40:41.962 --> 40:42.929
Yup.

40:47.199 --> 40:49.400
- Carol.
- Velma.

40:49.402 --> 40:51.503
Carol.

40:51.505 --> 40:53.172
- Daphne.
- Hi.

40:53.174 --> 40:56.141
Oh, shame stickers.
Everything okay?

40:56.143 --> 40:59.143
Yeah, um, you said I could come
to you if I needed help.

40:59.145 --> 41:02.045
- No questions asked.
- Of course.

41:03.049 --> 41:04.616
'This is too risky.'

41:04.618 --> 41:06.485
Mike and Ryder
are super hardcore

41:06.487 --> 41:08.152
especially when it comes
to defending Griffin.

41:08.154 --> 41:10.088
Shh.

41:10.090 --> 41:11.856
'Okay, here we go.'

41:11.858 --> 41:14.358
We will reveal their evil plan.

41:15.929 --> 41:17.362
'You know, like,
when I think about it'

41:17.364 --> 41:19.364
I don't really care
what I do when I grow up.

41:19.366 --> 41:22.501
I just wanna be, like,
a really good dad, you know?

41:22.503 --> 41:25.904
Dude, you will be the best dad.

41:25.906 --> 41:28.139
- You're a natural nurturer.
- 'Stop it.'

41:28.141 --> 41:33.043
No. Sometimes,
I wish you were... my dad.

41:35.215 --> 41:37.081
That's crazy.
Uh, I'm being crazy here.

41:37.083 --> 41:39.418
No, you're not being crazy.
Don't do that.

41:39.420 --> 41:42.320
You can always count on me.

41:45.324 --> 41:46.992
This is super uncomfortable.

41:46.994 --> 41:50.027
They're baring their souls, V.
It's beautiful.

41:52.132 --> 41:53.530
Easy.

41:53.532 --> 41:55.668
God, you're so paranoid.

41:57.637 --> 42:00.938
Oh, I forgot my phone
in my locker.

42:00.940 --> 42:03.373
I got something really,
really important on it.

42:03.375 --> 42:06.177
- Oh, yeah, that thing.
- 'Huh.'

42:06.179 --> 42:07.779
Yeah, that thing.

42:07.781 --> 42:09.447
I'll, uh, catch you guys later.

42:09.449 --> 42:11.483
- 'Yeah.'
- 'Yeah.'

42:11.485 --> 42:13.251
- He's leaving.
- We're stuck.

42:13.253 --> 42:15.219
This is what happens
when we work without a plan.

42:15.221 --> 42:17.855
It's fine. We just have
to think on the fly.

42:17.857 --> 42:20.291
You can come up with something,
V. I know it. Hit me.

42:22.061 --> 42:25.864
Okay, it's not a great plan,
but it will have to work.

42:25.866 --> 42:28.199
Hey, did you ever get the,
the landscapes assignment?

42:28.201 --> 42:31.135
Sorry, Aunt Piper.
You really do look hilarious.

42:31.137 --> 42:33.737
'You have a fantastic eye.'

42:35.608 --> 42:37.241
'Oh, my God!'

42:37.243 --> 42:39.009
That is embarrassing.

42:39.011 --> 42:40.144
Let's go.

42:41.315 --> 42:43.548
'Keep going. It's working.'

42:43.550 --> 42:45.250
'We're in so much trouble.'

42:45.252 --> 42:47.117
'Okay, you need to guide me.
Left or right?'

42:47.119 --> 42:49.487
- 'Left, Daphne.'
- 'Those are incredible.'

42:49.489 --> 42:51.855
'Daphne, can you hear me?
Left, that's right.'

42:51.857 --> 42:54.125
- 'T-that's my right, Velma.'
- 'Get it together.'

42:54.127 --> 42:56.262
'I wonder if this
is what it's like to drive.'

43:01.534 --> 43:03.002
Whoo!

43:12.045 --> 43:16.947
'The Robotics Club
will be hosting a tech-mixer in the..'

43:16.949 --> 43:18.483
No, he's already at his locker.

43:18.485 --> 43:20.050
What if we're too late?

43:20.052 --> 43:23.655
I have never seen so many
cute cats in my entire life.

43:23.657 --> 43:25.922
Oh, I want them.

43:25.924 --> 43:28.358
Is he watching cat videos?

43:28.360 --> 43:32.197
I want you, I want you,
I want you and I want you.

43:32.199 --> 43:34.465
That was the really,
really important thing?

43:34.467 --> 43:36.168
I'm gonna name you Fluffy-Muffy.

43:36.170 --> 43:37.802
Mm, I like that.

43:45.311 --> 43:47.077
Velma, I think
somebody is following us.

43:47.079 --> 43:49.380
What? Not now, Daphne,
we're gonna lose Griffin.

43:53.753 --> 43:56.190
- Stop!
- No!

43:59.058 --> 44:01.194
Well, there goes that theory.

44:06.000 --> 44:09.168
No. I already
sacrificed one robot.

44:12.572 --> 44:14.708
Oh, man.

44:25.018 --> 44:25.882
Again.

44:25.884 --> 44:28.920
What? Uh, what, girls?

44:28.922 --> 44:30.688
What happened
to the shame stickers?

44:31.991 --> 44:34.559
I'm sorry.

44:34.561 --> 44:35.960
I just..

44:35.962 --> 44:38.329
I can't believe
the shame stickers didn't work.

44:38.331 --> 44:41.599
'I ordered them specially.
You know, they usually work.'

44:41.601 --> 44:43.134
I'm pretty sure
if you were wearing them

44:43.136 --> 44:44.369
you wouldn't have melted
the lockers.

44:44.371 --> 44:46.103
Okay, Aunt Piper,
you have to believe us.

44:46.105 --> 44:48.907
- Something is up with Griffin.
- I thought it was Spencer.

44:48.909 --> 44:51.108
It is, uh, was.

44:51.110 --> 44:52.476
Griffin is up to something.

44:52.478 --> 44:54.746
Yeah, we saw him
go into a secret passage.

44:54.748 --> 44:56.815
We think he's the reason
Spencer seems zombified.

44:56.817 --> 44:59.083
Zombie what? Uh..

44:59.085 --> 45:01.385
Velma, I didn't think
you were the type of girl

45:01.387 --> 45:03.422
who believes in ghosts
and goblins.

45:03.424 --> 45:05.623
I'm not.
I believe there is a logical

45:05.625 --> 45:06.891
explanation behind this.

45:06.893 --> 45:10.027
Girls, I have no other choice.

45:10.029 --> 45:12.630
I gotta double down.

45:12.632 --> 45:15.199
Say hello to the shame drone.

45:15.201 --> 45:17.101
Remember me?

45:17.103 --> 45:18.769
And you still gotta wear
your stickers.

45:18.771 --> 45:20.538
Do you still think
Griffin's in on this?

45:20.540 --> 45:23.007
I mean, we saw him go into
the locker, same as Spencer.

45:23.009 --> 45:24.576
No, it's gotta be him.

45:24.578 --> 45:25.976
He benefits
if Spencer goes down.

45:25.978 --> 45:28.545
His family's won
the Bloom Bracket competition.

45:28.547 --> 45:29.780
It all makes sense.

45:29.782 --> 45:32.083
For shame.

45:32.085 --> 45:33.217
No.

45:35.154 --> 45:37.290
- I'm good.
- Oh, no.

45:38.625 --> 45:41.126
- Got it, got it, got it.
- Watch it, watch it.

45:41.128 --> 45:42.326
Whoa.

45:42.328 --> 45:44.594
You guys, something's
goin' on with Griffin.

45:44.596 --> 45:45.896
'Are you seeing this?'

45:45.898 --> 45:47.931
I'm good.

45:47.933 --> 45:49.634
Relax, he's fine.

45:49.636 --> 45:51.771
Yo, Griff. Heads up.

45:55.741 --> 45:58.376
I'm good.

45:58.378 --> 46:00.177
Didn't flinch.

46:00.179 --> 46:02.280
- Awesome, dude!
- That's awesome.

46:02.282 --> 46:04.981
That was sick.
Number one, baby.

46:04.983 --> 46:07.652
- You are the man, Griff.
- 'For shame.'

46:07.654 --> 46:09.286
If Griffin's been zombified,
then..

46:09.288 --> 46:11.456
- 'I'm good.'
- ...who's behind this?

46:11.458 --> 46:13.757
I mean,
there's no logical explanation.

46:13.759 --> 46:15.425
What if the answer
isn't logical?

46:15.427 --> 46:18.864
The secret passages,
kids turned to lifeless zombies.

46:18.866 --> 46:20.130
Maybe it's not a person
behind this.

46:20.132 --> 46:22.032
- Don't say it.
- What if it's a..

46:22.034 --> 46:23.701
- A spirit, a ghost?
- You said it.

46:23.703 --> 46:25.068
Look,
you don't have to believe me

46:25.070 --> 46:27.338
but something's
been following us.

46:27.340 --> 46:28.639
I can feel it.

46:28.641 --> 46:30.608
And the one thing we know
for sure is that they're clearly

46:30.610 --> 46:33.279
going after whoever has the top
spot in the Bloom Bracket.

46:35.380 --> 46:37.518
Well, then whoever
has the top spot next..

46:38.552 --> 46:40.354
...could be in danger.

46:42.221 --> 46:45.155
For shame.

46:45.157 --> 46:48.159
- I'm good.
- Hey, wait for me.

46:48.161 --> 46:50.894
It's Mikayla. We need to get
Mikayla out of the top spot

46:50.896 --> 46:53.030
before anyone hurts her.

46:53.032 --> 46:55.967
But then her replacement
will just be in danger.

46:55.969 --> 46:57.434
And then we'll have to save them

46:57.436 --> 46:59.369
and then their replacement
and then, and their...

46:59.371 --> 47:01.206
Stay with me, V.
We can't just put

47:01.208 --> 47:03.039
some random kid in danger
to save Mikayla.

47:03.041 --> 47:05.610
So what? We just give up?

47:05.612 --> 47:07.411
No, listen.

47:07.413 --> 47:09.280
There's no way I can get
to that number one spot

47:09.282 --> 47:11.548
but I know
you've been holding back.

47:11.550 --> 47:13.083
I'm not doing that.

47:13.085 --> 47:15.320
What do you mean?

47:15.322 --> 47:18.188
I mean,
I'll be in danger, Daphne.

47:18.190 --> 47:20.657
I changed my whole identity
to stay out of the line of fire

47:20.659 --> 47:22.693
and now you're basically
volunteering me up as bait?

47:22.695 --> 47:23.994
Well, at least I'm trying
to do something

47:23.996 --> 47:25.295
instead of being selfish.

47:25.297 --> 47:26.864
- Selfish?
- Yeah.

47:26.866 --> 47:29.266
- By not taking risks.
- Risks?

47:29.268 --> 47:32.469
You told me your dad has taken
care of you your whole life.

47:32.471 --> 47:35.474
At least I am trying to do
something about it.

47:37.177 --> 47:39.509
Look, we can do this.

47:39.511 --> 47:41.447
We can do anything.

47:42.348 --> 47:44.047
Trust me.

47:44.049 --> 47:45.849
Things always work out.

47:45.851 --> 47:47.987
Even if they're harder
right now.

47:49.422 --> 47:53.324
Okay, but it's not gonna be
enough to just push me up.

47:53.326 --> 47:55.759
We're gonna have to push
other people down.

47:55.761 --> 47:57.762
Like sabotage them?

47:57.764 --> 47:59.197
It feels wrong.

47:59.199 --> 48:01.231
We're protecting them.

48:01.233 --> 48:02.400
You said I'm the planner

48:02.402 --> 48:04.538
and this is the best plan
we've got.

48:05.971 --> 48:08.139
Okay, let's do it.

48:08.141 --> 48:11.445
First up, how are we gonna
shoot you up that board?

48:13.547 --> 48:15.780
That's the easy part.

48:21.855 --> 48:23.655
Well, better late than never.

48:23.657 --> 48:26.590
Although I can't say
that I'm expecting much.

48:34.800 --> 48:37.434
Very impressive.

49:08.335 --> 49:11.735
- Where's my ribbon?
- Thanks again, Velma.

49:16.610 --> 49:18.476
'Mikayla Martin's art exhibit'

49:18.478 --> 49:20.545
'on display
in the Black Box Theater'

49:20.547 --> 49:23.480
'from 4:00 to 6:00 p.m.
See you there.'

49:23.482 --> 49:26.684
'Listen up, people,
it will be great..

49:26.686 --> 49:29.019
Mikayla's the only
one left ahead of me.

49:29.021 --> 49:31.355
V, we can't destroy this.

49:31.357 --> 49:33.289
- It's beautiful.
- We don't have to.

49:33.291 --> 49:34.858
We just have to cut the power
to the spotlights.

49:34.860 --> 49:37.697
But we have to be quick, okay?
The show opens in a few minutes.

49:44.804 --> 49:46.605
- 'Jinkies.'
- What?

49:48.842 --> 49:50.344
Ghost!

49:52.078 --> 49:53.777
- 'Velma?'
- 'Daphne.'

49:53.779 --> 49:56.547
'I'm over here.
Follow my voice.'

49:56.549 --> 49:58.382
'It's like super
dark in here, Mikayla.'

49:58.384 --> 50:00.583
- 'Is this part of the art?'
- Oh, no.

50:00.585 --> 50:02.585
'No, no, no, no.'

50:02.587 --> 50:05.088
- Oh, look at the mess.
- How could this happen?

50:07.226 --> 50:08.992
Someone did this.

50:08.994 --> 50:12.163
I have to sneeze.

50:12.165 --> 50:13.597
You'll give us away.

50:13.599 --> 50:16.000
It's actually pretty funny.

50:16.002 --> 50:18.168
I never have to sneeze.

50:18.170 --> 50:21.706
Well, like, this will be
only the first time

50:21.708 --> 50:25.108
I sneeze in seven years.

50:25.110 --> 50:28.779
Okay, first
of all, do not sneeze.

50:28.781 --> 50:31.148
'Secondly, you really'

50:31.150 --> 50:32.882
should be sneezing more
in your daily life.

50:32.884 --> 50:34.451
That doesn't seem healthy.

50:37.389 --> 50:40.056
- Go, go, go!
- Wow.

50:40.058 --> 50:42.194
Was that part of your art?

50:45.364 --> 50:47.764
This just got a lot weirder.

50:47.766 --> 50:51.936
Daphne, what was that thing
back there?

50:51.938 --> 50:53.237
It was floating.

50:53.239 --> 50:55.440
You're not gonna tell me
it was all in my head?

50:55.442 --> 50:56.673
There's a rational explanation?

50:56.675 --> 50:59.143
There is no
rational explanation.

50:59.145 --> 51:00.844
It didn't look human.

51:00.846 --> 51:04.114
But I think it's what's behind
all of this.

51:04.116 --> 51:06.150
Well, the good news is
we're probably

51:06.152 --> 51:08.387
in a super creepy
ghost tunnel system.

51:10.188 --> 51:12.658
The bad news is obvious.

51:15.127 --> 51:17.128
I think I hear voices.

51:29.641 --> 51:30.743
Ow! Eww.

51:42.688 --> 51:45.657
'We're in the secret
passages behind the lockers.'

51:45.659 --> 51:47.194
Look.

51:57.036 --> 51:59.036
Okay, these don't come
with a regular high school.

51:59.038 --> 52:02.306
- Somebody built these.
- Aliens.

52:02.308 --> 52:03.808
I'm kiddin'. I'm kiddin'.
I'm just trying to lighten

52:03.810 --> 52:06.677
the whole
we're-in-terrible-danger vibe.

52:06.679 --> 52:09.847
'For real,
how could a ghost build this?'

52:09.849 --> 52:11.785
It doesn't make any sense.

52:13.052 --> 52:14.818
Ghost. Run!

52:48.855 --> 52:49.856
Come on.

52:58.797 --> 52:59.765
Jinkies.

53:04.136 --> 53:06.003
What the..

53:06.005 --> 53:07.174
Mikayla.

53:08.375 --> 53:10.340
Velma, we gotta do something.
Hurry.

53:10.342 --> 53:12.710
- Let me analyze this system.
- Help me.

53:12.712 --> 53:14.212
It's okay. We're gonna get you
out of here.

53:14.214 --> 53:15.813
I can't override the system,
Daphne.

53:15.815 --> 53:17.547
- We have to hurry.
- Okay, I'm trying.

53:17.549 --> 53:20.518
- Read me the serial number.
- Uh, "G06592."

53:20.520 --> 53:22.822
'Okay, it's not doing anything.'

53:24.056 --> 53:26.757
- Mikayla!
- No!

53:26.759 --> 53:30.027
Velma, the tube just ate her.
The tube ate Mikayla.

53:30.029 --> 53:32.829
Okay, I'm pretty sure it's just
a secret elevator or something.

53:32.831 --> 53:34.864
- Okay, right, right.
- Yeah.

53:34.866 --> 53:36.501
'Why are there
all these computers'

53:36.503 --> 53:39.469
in a hidden room
behind the school?

53:39.471 --> 53:41.540
Those are social media feeds.

53:43.007 --> 53:44.675
'So this computer
has been updating'

53:44.677 --> 53:46.876
Spencer's social media
with all those fake posts.

53:46.878 --> 53:48.982
And all the other
zombified kids.

53:50.915 --> 53:53.184
"Matchmouth."

53:53.186 --> 53:55.152
'Daphne.'

54:04.531 --> 54:07.967
Daphne, there is only one exit.

54:09.168 --> 54:10.537
We're trapped.

54:12.005 --> 54:13.440
This way.

54:16.675 --> 54:18.742
- Daphne.
- 'Yeah.'

54:18.744 --> 54:20.445
What if there really is a ghost?

54:20.447 --> 54:22.179
I know I'm usually the one
who believes in ghosts

54:22.181 --> 54:24.382
but look around.

54:24.384 --> 54:25.782
Computers, Wi-Fi.

54:25.784 --> 54:27.617
And why would a ghost
need a chair?

54:27.619 --> 54:29.353
Yeah, yeah, you're right.
You're right.

54:29.355 --> 54:31.491
A ghost won't have a butt.

54:34.194 --> 54:35.458
I'll smoosh its head with this.

54:35.460 --> 54:37.927
Velma, oh.

54:37.929 --> 54:39.297
Let's trip it.

54:39.299 --> 54:41.034
- Oh, fine.
- Okay.

54:45.070 --> 54:47.271
Not today, hooded figure!

54:47.273 --> 54:48.972
Daphne, wait.

54:48.974 --> 54:51.108
Daphne, it's me!

54:51.110 --> 54:53.710
Dad? What are you doing?

54:53.712 --> 54:55.413
I thought I was supposed
to pick you up today.

54:55.415 --> 54:58.282
Really? You're gonna use
that one again?

54:58.284 --> 54:59.882
You said your friend's
been taken? B-by who...

54:59.884 --> 55:03.019
Hey, don't change the subject.
Why are you following us?

55:03.021 --> 55:04.688
And why are you dressed
like a ghost?

55:04.690 --> 55:06.257
I'm not dressed like a ghost,
but..

55:06.259 --> 55:08.858
This is a bathrobe. I didn't
want you to recognize me.

55:08.860 --> 55:10.427
This is why we thought
you were floating.

55:10.429 --> 55:11.962
Yeah, it's for my leg.

55:11.964 --> 55:14.766
- 'You're Velma, right?'
- How do you know my name?

55:14.768 --> 55:18.001
Oh, I've been... looking around.

55:18.003 --> 55:19.769
- Yeah, about that...
- I know, I know.

55:19.771 --> 55:21.706
I know you said you could handle
yourself, but I couldn't bear

55:21.708 --> 55:23.306
the thought of just laying
around and not knowing

55:23.308 --> 55:25.041
if you were okay.

55:25.043 --> 55:26.543
I'm, I'm sorry.

55:26.545 --> 55:28.344
It's okay.
I mean, yeah, you scared us.

55:28.346 --> 55:30.480
But if you hadn't, we never
would have found this room.

55:30.482 --> 55:31.882
So, I guess, um

55:31.884 --> 55:34.418
being a helicopter parent
was a good thing.

55:34.420 --> 55:36.619
No, absolutely not.

55:36.621 --> 55:38.757
And we're gonna talk
about that later. Alright?

55:40.125 --> 55:41.559
Hey, what's this?

55:43.429 --> 55:46.163
Oh, now you're giving me
the silent treatment?

55:46.165 --> 55:47.500
Daph?

55:49.268 --> 55:50.900
Daphne.

55:50.902 --> 55:52.038
Velma?

56:02.581 --> 56:03.813
- Dad.
- What happened?

56:03.815 --> 56:05.349
'Okay, that was so weird.'

56:05.351 --> 56:06.516
It was like
you went into a trance

56:06.518 --> 56:08.085
or you were sleepwalking
or something.

56:08.087 --> 56:09.920
It was like my brain was being
overloaded or something.

56:09.922 --> 56:12.322
- Wait. It didn't affect you?
- No.

56:12.324 --> 56:14.092
Those audio files
must use a frequency

56:14.094 --> 56:15.492
that can only be heard by kids.

56:15.494 --> 56:17.527
Velma,
that's super advanced tech.

56:17.529 --> 56:20.230
Somebody built these passages
behind the lockers.

56:20.232 --> 56:23.534
That kind of thing would never
get by Tobias Bloom.

56:23.536 --> 56:24.835
- Bloom Innovative.
- Bloom Innovative.

56:24.837 --> 56:26.268
And there's a property
of Bloom Innovative

56:26.270 --> 56:27.503
right on that tube thing...

56:27.505 --> 56:29.172
Okay, don't take
this away from us.

56:29.174 --> 56:30.440
Sorry.

56:30.442 --> 56:32.108
- Dad.
- Oh, we gotta call your mom.

56:32.110 --> 56:33.677
'Bloom's been pushing
her for all her tech.'

56:33.679 --> 56:35.880
This is all Matchmouth.
This is her stuff.

56:35.882 --> 56:37.514
This thing doesn't work
down here.

56:37.516 --> 56:39.652
Uh, here, I'll-I'll hack
into the school's Wi-Fi.

56:41.654 --> 56:44.286
- Here, put in her number.
- Okay.

56:44.288 --> 56:46.690
- Mom.
- Hey, hey, hon.

56:46.692 --> 56:49.393
- Nedley, what are you doing?
- Mom, are you okay?

56:49.395 --> 56:50.693
Sure, just a bit tired.

56:50.695 --> 56:52.130
Tobias wants this
finished tonight.

56:52.132 --> 56:53.496
Hey, no, you gotta
get out of there.

56:53.498 --> 56:54.831
Is something wrong?

56:54.833 --> 56:56.367
There is no time to explain,
Mrs. Blake.

56:56.369 --> 56:59.369
- Uh, I'm Velma, by the way.
- Nice to meet you.

56:59.371 --> 57:00.771
Mom, there's something going on.

57:00.773 --> 57:02.405
Tobias Bloom isn't who
we thought he was.

57:02.407 --> 57:04.108
Oh, hello, Mr. Bloom.

57:04.110 --> 57:05.675
- No, no, no, honey, honey.
- No, mom. Get out of there.

57:05.677 --> 57:08.612
- Honey! Honey!
- No! No!

57:08.614 --> 57:10.683
This is my fault.

57:12.752 --> 57:15.552
Bloom runs this school.

57:15.554 --> 57:16.719
I can't do this.

57:16.721 --> 57:18.623
- Yes, you can.
- No.

57:18.625 --> 57:20.190
I thought
I could handle my own life

57:20.192 --> 57:23.059
but everything I've ever done
has blown up in my face.

57:23.061 --> 57:26.096
My mom is in danger,
you're in danger.

57:26.098 --> 57:28.297
Maybe you should just go back
to taking care of me, dad.

57:28.299 --> 57:30.501
Oh, no, no, no, kiddo, don't.

57:30.503 --> 57:33.804
Ah, I, I don't wanna
go back to that.

57:33.806 --> 57:35.838
Listen, I, I didn't do
those things for you

57:35.840 --> 57:37.541
because I didn't think
you were capable or smart

57:37.543 --> 57:39.842
or because I thought
you were afraid, I..

57:39.844 --> 57:42.980
I did those things
because I was afraid.

57:42.982 --> 57:45.748
'And I am not afraid
for you anymore, Daphne.'

57:45.750 --> 57:48.719
I mean, look what you two did.
You attacked a ghost.

57:48.721 --> 57:51.788
Daphne, before you got here,
I was just solving mysteries

57:51.790 --> 57:54.558
behind the safety
of a computer screen.

57:54.560 --> 57:55.893
I melted a locker.

57:55.895 --> 57:58.094
I went undercover
in the cafeteria.

57:58.096 --> 58:00.864
I ran through the hallways
past school hours.

58:00.866 --> 58:04.268
I am stronger
than I ever thought I was.

58:04.270 --> 58:06.570
And you showed me that.

58:06.572 --> 58:08.637
We know who we have
to take down.

58:08.639 --> 58:11.842
Okay. Let's do this.

58:11.844 --> 58:13.576
Alright.

58:13.578 --> 58:15.080
What are we doing?

58:19.953 --> 58:23.152
'Maggie, have
you seen my keys?'

58:34.266 --> 58:36.602
'What, what? Is that you, mom?'

58:45.945 --> 58:47.878
No, Velma.

58:47.880 --> 58:49.014
'No!'

58:56.556 --> 58:58.691
Bloom Innovative sound buds.

59:00.192 --> 59:02.793
- Mr. Blake, can you hear us?
- Yeah, I'm right here.

59:02.795 --> 59:04.862
- Can you hear me?
- Loud and clear.

59:04.864 --> 59:06.998
Dad, check the surveillance
for this place.

59:07.000 --> 59:08.266
'Is there
only one security guard?'

59:08.268 --> 59:10.634
Yeah, I see one guard
in the foyer.

59:10.636 --> 59:12.768
But there are two
heat signatures

59:12.770 --> 59:14.572
'on the 22nd floor.'

59:14.574 --> 59:17.340
Alright. Step one.
Let's get this guy in.

59:17.342 --> 59:19.175
'Listen, Daph, I'm so happy'

59:19.177 --> 59:21.344
'that we're having an adventure
together, you know.'

59:21.346 --> 59:23.014
'Most dads
and their teenage daughters'

59:23.016 --> 59:24.248
'are arguing all the time,
you know.'

59:24.250 --> 59:26.751
'You-you-you, just,
we're like..'

59:26.753 --> 59:28.951
'I feel like we're buds,
you know.'

59:28.953 --> 59:31.123
'Hey, what's that?
Is that jelly?'

59:32.525 --> 59:33.791
'How did you get jelly on the..'

59:33.793 --> 59:35.626
'Oh, oh, it's smoking.
It's a..'

59:38.130 --> 59:40.264
- 'Did you just...'
- Awesome.

59:40.266 --> 59:42.032
- 'Daphne. Daphne Blake.'
- Nailed it.

59:42.034 --> 59:43.733
'You stop right now.'

59:43.735 --> 59:45.335
'You're grounded.
Do you hear me?'

59:45.337 --> 59:47.170
'Hey, that's a perfect circle.
How did you do that?'

59:47.172 --> 59:48.706
We'll use the shame drone
to lure

59:48.708 --> 59:51.409
the security guard
away from his post.

59:54.012 --> 59:56.579
'W-what is that thing on
the, on the drone? Is that a rock?'

59:56.581 --> 59:57.847
Why would you..

59:57.849 --> 59:59.750
You didn't lure him away.

59:59.752 --> 01:00:01.318
'You hit him with that rock!'

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:04.221
'That was assault.
That's assault!'

01:00:04.223 --> 01:00:06.423
Well, that works.

01:00:06.425 --> 01:00:07.791
Let's go.

01:00:55.239 --> 01:00:57.243
'In security mode.'

01:00:59.143 --> 01:01:01.677
- Velma, what's going on?
- The power must have gone out.

01:01:01.679 --> 01:01:03.480
You can't do
anything without your dad.

01:01:03.482 --> 01:01:05.081
I didn't say that.

01:01:05.083 --> 01:01:06.683
We should be safe at
home, not on the front lines.

01:01:06.685 --> 01:01:08.351
I did, I did not say that.

01:01:08.353 --> 01:01:10.021
What if the mass
of the Earth is too great

01:01:10.023 --> 01:01:11.889
that it collapses
back onto itself?

01:01:11.891 --> 01:01:13.222
No one's gonna help you.

01:01:13.224 --> 01:01:15.059
You've never done
anything on your own.

01:01:15.061 --> 01:01:16.393
This must be some
kind of security system.

01:01:16.395 --> 01:01:18.663
The room is feeding off
our insecurities.

01:01:18.665 --> 01:01:19.896
Creating copies
that are reflecting

01:01:19.898 --> 01:01:21.498
our deepest, darkest fears.

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:23.400
We'll never
have a female president.

01:01:23.402 --> 01:01:24.802
You're gonna lose your glasses

01:01:24.804 --> 01:01:26.070
and fall right off a cliff.

01:01:26.072 --> 01:01:27.670
- Stay calm.
- I-I-I can't.

01:01:27.672 --> 01:01:29.572
I mean, what if
something pops out at us

01:01:29.574 --> 01:01:33.277
or-or a trapped door
or like wolves or something?

01:01:33.279 --> 01:01:35.945
Wolves? Are you insane?
How will they even get in here?

01:01:35.947 --> 01:01:37.313
Listen to me, we're okay.

01:01:37.315 --> 01:01:38.882
All we need to do
is overload the system.

01:01:38.884 --> 01:01:40.351
- How?
- You said it.

01:01:40.353 --> 01:01:41.784
It's preying
on our insecurities.

01:01:41.786 --> 01:01:43.019
So let's show
we don't have any.

01:01:45.357 --> 01:01:47.824
I love how you always
think a hundred steps ahead.

01:01:47.826 --> 01:01:49.693
Come on.

01:01:49.695 --> 01:01:51.896
Your optimism
radiates like rainbows.

01:01:51.898 --> 01:01:53.262
I love rainbows.

01:01:53.264 --> 01:01:56.266
...better than anyone.

01:01:56.268 --> 01:01:58.936
You make me believe
people are okay.

01:01:58.938 --> 01:02:00.436
I do inspire.

01:02:00.438 --> 01:02:02.873
We are the
writers of our destiny.

01:02:02.875 --> 01:02:05.309
Our intellects are our weapons.

01:02:05.311 --> 01:02:07.244
And dogs love me.

01:02:07.246 --> 01:02:08.945
'Security overload.'

01:02:10.581 --> 01:02:12.483
We did it.

01:02:18.590 --> 01:02:20.690
This is supposed to be
one of the biggest companies

01:02:20.692 --> 01:02:23.326
in the world
and there's no one here?

01:02:23.328 --> 01:02:24.764
Something's up.

01:02:41.579 --> 01:02:43.049
Mom!

01:02:44.415 --> 01:02:47.117
Hm. I'm good.

01:02:47.119 --> 01:02:49.018
She's acting like Spencer
and all the other kids.

01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:52.124
- 'Unplug those wires.'
- Stop right there.

01:02:53.090 --> 01:02:54.824
No offense, but I really wish

01:02:54.826 --> 01:02:56.525
you would have died
in my elevator.

01:02:56.527 --> 01:02:58.161
Tobias Bloom.

01:02:58.163 --> 01:03:00.996
- It's you.
- In the flesh.

01:03:00.998 --> 01:03:03.699
Uh, died?
It's just an elevator.

01:03:03.701 --> 01:03:06.003
Filled with wolves.

01:03:06.005 --> 01:03:09.505
I forgot to put in the wolves.

01:03:09.507 --> 01:03:10.840
What is this thing?

01:03:10.842 --> 01:03:13.409
Well, now that you're locked
in here

01:03:13.411 --> 01:03:15.982
I don't see any problem
with giving you some details.

01:03:17.148 --> 01:03:19.183
The brainstormer machine.

01:03:19.185 --> 01:03:22.585
It sucks the creative energy
and personality out of people.

01:03:22.587 --> 01:03:26.690
And why? Well, Bloom Innovative
must always stay

01:03:26.692 --> 01:03:29.393
on the cutting edge
of technological advancements.

01:03:29.395 --> 01:03:31.661
And unfortunately for me

01:03:31.663 --> 01:03:34.898
ideas are hard to come by.

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:39.702
Luckily, kids seem
to have a lot of them.

01:03:39.704 --> 01:03:41.637
Of course.

01:03:41.639 --> 01:03:44.206
Olivia was a musical prodigy.

01:03:44.208 --> 01:03:47.177
You used her brain energy
to make your sound buds.

01:03:47.179 --> 01:03:49.146
And Spencer was always going on

01:03:49.148 --> 01:03:51.581
about using his phone
to make food.

01:03:51.583 --> 01:03:54.453
You used his brain power
to make your 3D food printer.

01:03:55.887 --> 01:04:00.891
Both of you are so
creatively annoying.

01:04:00.893 --> 01:04:02.291
Can't wait to see
what kind of ideas

01:04:02.293 --> 01:04:04.193
the brainstormer
sucks out of you.

01:04:04.195 --> 01:04:07.297
'Until then
good luck with my spiders.'

01:04:11.503 --> 01:04:13.735
What do we do, V?

01:04:13.737 --> 01:04:15.639
We don't have a plan.

01:04:15.641 --> 01:04:17.139
We don't have time for a plan.

01:04:17.141 --> 01:04:18.944
You take care of your mom.

01:04:19.945 --> 01:04:22.012
I'm goin' in.

01:04:26.252 --> 01:04:27.983
'Target locked.'

01:04:34.927 --> 01:04:36.896
Daph, you okay over there?

01:04:42.567 --> 01:04:45.304
'I can't, I
can't let go of myself.'

01:04:47.139 --> 01:04:49.438
'Activate web.'

01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.343
'Target lost.'

01:04:55.714 --> 01:04:57.049
Jinkies.

01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:03.222
'No!'

01:05:06.491 --> 01:05:07.627
Mom.

01:05:10.096 --> 01:05:11.462
'Honey, is that you?'

01:05:11.464 --> 01:05:13.963
Dad, keep mom talking
and call the police.

01:05:13.965 --> 01:05:15.731
'Well, Elizabeth, you'll
never believe what's happening...'

01:05:15.733 --> 01:05:16.933
Honey.

01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:20.105
Well.

01:05:20.806 --> 01:05:22.639
It's over Bloom.

01:05:22.641 --> 01:05:25.074
And also, I scuffed one of my
boots kicking your robots

01:05:25.076 --> 01:05:26.309
so I need you
to get on top of that

01:05:26.311 --> 01:05:27.644
'cause my allowance
is pretty low.

01:05:27.646 --> 01:05:29.215
- Do it, V.
- Yeah.

01:05:32.217 --> 01:05:34.617
- He's a..
- He's a ghost.

01:05:34.619 --> 01:05:36.955
No, he's a hologram. Look.

01:05:42.561 --> 01:05:43.696
Wait a second.

01:05:45.195 --> 01:05:47.329
I knew he looked familiar.

01:05:47.331 --> 01:05:48.565
This guy isn't a tech genius.

01:05:48.567 --> 01:05:51.969
He's the most famous
male model in Japan.

01:05:51.971 --> 01:05:53.436
I like that hair.

01:05:53.438 --> 01:05:56.509
Wait, if Tobias Bloom's
a hologram, then..

01:05:57.942 --> 01:05:59.611
What's controllin' him?

01:06:02.047 --> 01:06:05.148
I'm not sayin' I won't fight
another army of robotic spiders.

01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:07.050
I'm just sayin' I'm gonna need
a snack if I do it

01:06:07.052 --> 01:06:09.188
'cause my blood sugar
is getting kind of low.

01:06:11.223 --> 01:06:13.657
- Carol!
- Carol!

01:06:13.659 --> 01:06:16.826
Help! Help!
You guys, you have to help me.

01:06:16.828 --> 01:06:18.994
Oh, Bloom, he kidnapped me.

01:06:18.996 --> 01:06:20.663
He attacked me
and he brought me here...

01:06:20.665 --> 01:06:23.833
Wait, wait, wait,
how could Bloom kidnap you?

01:06:23.835 --> 01:06:27.404
- He's a hologram.
- That's a great question.

01:06:27.406 --> 01:06:31.273
A-all I know is-is I-I w-was
sucked here by this thing.

01:06:31.275 --> 01:06:33.210
Well then,
why aren't you zombified?

01:06:33.212 --> 01:06:35.014
Well, because I..

01:06:35.947 --> 01:06:37.282
I..

01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:41.016
Well, well, well.

01:06:41.018 --> 01:06:43.353
You two make quite a good team.

01:06:43.355 --> 01:06:48.025
A horrible, annoying,
terrible team.

01:06:48.027 --> 01:06:50.726
You are behind all of this.

01:06:50.728 --> 01:06:52.929
Why am I not surprised?

01:06:52.931 --> 01:06:55.498
But why the hologram?
Why the false identity?

01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:59.137
Who's gonna let a teenage girl
run a billion dollar company?

01:07:00.471 --> 01:07:02.873
<i>The first Azalea phone
was my idea.</i>

01:07:02.875 --> 01:07:06.275
<i>But I knew no one would take me
seriously because of my age.</i>

01:07:06.277 --> 01:07:10.313
<i>So you created Tobias Bloom
using an obscure model's image</i>

01:07:10.315 --> 01:07:12.849
<i>and then you started
Bloom Innovative as a cover-up.</i>

01:07:12.851 --> 01:07:14.818
<i>So you could keep
going to school and meet</i>

01:07:14.820 --> 01:07:19.054
<i>the young new lines that would
think up your next inventions.</i>

01:07:19.056 --> 01:07:21.291
<i>You lured them in.</i>

01:07:21.293 --> 01:07:23.860
<i>You used their phones
that played hypnotic frequencies</i>

01:07:23.862 --> 01:07:26.864
<i>that led them to the passages
behind the lockers.</i>

01:07:26.866 --> 01:07:28.797
<i>Then you brought them here</i>

01:07:28.799 --> 01:07:31.403
<i>where you stole
their greatest ideas.</i>

01:07:32.770 --> 01:07:35.905
But this has been happening
for years.

01:07:35.907 --> 01:07:38.442
- How old are you?
- Rude.

01:07:38.444 --> 01:07:40.710
She's not really a teenager.

01:07:40.712 --> 01:07:44.012
You know, when I mentioned
Legitimate Tulip to her

01:07:44.014 --> 01:07:46.217
she had no idea who they were.

01:07:47.119 --> 01:07:49.085
And everyone loves that band.

01:07:49.087 --> 01:07:51.119
They're okay, I guess.

01:07:51.121 --> 01:07:53.155
That's kind of flimsy evidence.

01:07:53.157 --> 01:07:55.625
No, she's right.

01:07:55.627 --> 01:07:56.793
I'm 26.

01:07:56.795 --> 01:08:01.465
Wow. You look great for 26.

01:08:01.467 --> 01:08:03.366
It's not really that old,
but thank you.

01:08:03.368 --> 01:08:05.601
- Ahem!
- What?

01:08:05.603 --> 01:08:08.806
I'm not gonna lie
just because she's evil.

01:08:08.808 --> 01:08:11.675
Okay, why did you do it and how?

01:08:11.677 --> 01:08:15.512
How? I moisturize.
Keeps the skin young.

01:08:15.514 --> 01:08:18.279
Okay, maybe the why
is more interesting.

01:08:18.282 --> 01:08:20.817
She couldn't handle
the pressure..

01:08:20.819 --> 01:08:23.787
...to keep coming up
with new products and ideas

01:08:23.788 --> 01:08:25.354
year after year.

01:08:25.356 --> 01:08:28.323
She craved the power
and the glory to stay on top.

01:08:28.325 --> 01:08:31.296
Don't forget about the money
and the power.

01:08:32.296 --> 01:08:33.328
I just said that.

01:08:33.331 --> 01:08:34.930
I'm not really listening to you.

01:08:36.033 --> 01:08:37.067
Whoa.

01:08:37.069 --> 01:08:38.667
Well, Carol

01:08:38.669 --> 01:08:40.804
I wish it didn't
have to end like this.

01:08:40.805 --> 01:08:43.372
You know, it doesn't. You two
could just totally let me go.

01:08:43.374 --> 01:08:45.576
I was just being polite.
It totally has to end like this.

01:08:45.578 --> 01:08:49.145
I for sure dreamed
it would end like this.

01:08:49.147 --> 01:08:51.180
I would have gotten away
with it, too

01:08:51.182 --> 01:08:52.916
if it weren't for you
meddling kids.

01:08:55.853 --> 01:08:57.019
No!

01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:59.291
No!

01:09:00.357 --> 01:09:02.559
Eww. The board was evil.

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:05.461
Yeah.
It's literally representative

01:09:05.462 --> 01:09:09.298
how technology in a way
has enslaved our minds.

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:11.067
But it is also indicative
of the fact that

01:09:11.069 --> 01:09:14.770
societal peer pressure forces us
to be something we're not.

01:09:14.772 --> 01:09:16.506
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

01:09:16.508 --> 01:09:17.975
I know.

01:09:17.977 --> 01:09:20.644
But it was nice
to be number one for once.

01:09:20.645 --> 01:09:23.546
Hey, dude, you're still
number one in our book.

01:09:23.548 --> 01:09:25.613
Yeah, we're good friends.

01:09:25.616 --> 01:09:28.118
- You guys mean that?
- Yeah, man.

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:30.987
- Oh, yeah.
- Put it here.

01:09:30.988 --> 01:09:33.692
Br-r-r-r-r-aah!

01:09:35.627 --> 01:09:38.027
- D and V, what's good?
- What's up?

01:09:38.029 --> 01:09:39.662
- What's up?
- What's up?

01:09:39.663 --> 01:09:40.895
Thank you guys so much
for helping us.

01:09:40.898 --> 01:09:42.231
How did it happen?

01:09:42.233 --> 01:09:43.667
Carol hacked
into your Bloom phones

01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:45.402
and used hypnotic frequencies
to lure you

01:09:45.404 --> 01:09:46.836
into the hallways
behind the lockers.

01:09:46.837 --> 01:09:48.636
'And then she used
a brainstormer machine'

01:09:48.639 --> 01:09:50.872
to sap all your creative ideas
for herself.

01:09:50.875 --> 01:09:54.210
I definitely suspected something
was up with that Carol.

01:09:54.212 --> 01:09:55.912
Too perfect of a record.

01:09:55.914 --> 01:09:59.916
And I never liked that
pretty boy Tobias Bloom either.

01:09:59.918 --> 01:10:01.317
"Oh, I'm handsome." Yuck.

01:10:01.319 --> 01:10:03.286
Sure, you didn't, Aunt Piper.

01:10:03.288 --> 01:10:04.921
Well, I'm just glad

01:10:04.923 --> 01:10:07.122
that you're back
to your old self again.

01:10:07.124 --> 01:10:09.525
- Me too.
- Me three.

01:10:09.527 --> 01:10:12.060
- 'Computer chips.'
- Computer chips!

01:10:19.271 --> 01:10:21.270
I appreciate the gesture

01:10:21.272 --> 01:10:24.073
but gift card
would have been nice.

01:10:25.209 --> 01:10:26.743
Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:10:26.745 --> 01:10:27.644
Wait up.

01:10:30.781 --> 01:10:33.315
Oh, you.

01:10:33.317 --> 01:10:34.817
I gotta deal with you.

01:10:34.819 --> 01:10:37.520
Maybe I could find you
on Facebook.

01:10:37.522 --> 01:10:39.154
Goodbye.

01:10:41.259 --> 01:10:42.425
Again.

01:10:45.297 --> 01:10:47.262
Oh! Oh!

01:10:47.264 --> 01:10:49.064
That whole creepy elevator thing
and the..

01:10:49.066 --> 01:10:50.699
I don't even know
how you got out of there.

01:10:50.701 --> 01:10:53.069
- You're brave.
- With my bravery from my dad.

01:10:53.071 --> 01:10:55.238
Stop it.

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:57.073
Yep.

01:10:57.075 --> 01:10:59.042
- Yeah.
- Um, it's Velma.

01:10:59.044 --> 01:11:00.076
- Go ahead.
- Alright.

01:11:00.078 --> 01:11:01.411
I'll see you guys later.

01:11:01.413 --> 01:11:02.845
- Be brave.
- 'I will.'

01:11:02.847 --> 01:11:04.514
Like your pops.

01:11:04.516 --> 01:11:06.550
I didn't want you to get too
excited before I looked into it.

01:11:06.552 --> 01:11:08.984
But last night someone sent me
an encrypted file.

01:11:08.986 --> 01:11:10.854
'Reckless. I love it, V.'

01:11:10.856 --> 01:11:12.454
It looks like
someone's been keeping track

01:11:12.456 --> 01:11:14.491
of tons of mysteries
around the world.

01:11:14.493 --> 01:11:16.493
Huh, you think
they're all connected?

01:11:16.495 --> 01:11:17.993
I don't know. Let me show you.

01:11:20.432 --> 01:11:21.867
Someone noticed us.

01:11:27.272 --> 01:11:29.872
- Uh, V, what is happening?
- 'No, I'm not doing this.'

01:11:29.874 --> 01:11:32.542
- Well, do something.
- I am trying.

01:11:32.544 --> 01:11:34.243
Don't touch my computer, Daphne.

01:11:34.245 --> 01:11:36.313
Sorry.

01:11:36.315 --> 01:11:40.516
Stay away or else..

01:11:40.518 --> 01:11:43.489
- Could be a real monster.
- Monsters aren't real.

01:11:45.389 --> 01:11:47.356
We'll see about that.
