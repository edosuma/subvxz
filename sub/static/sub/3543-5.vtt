WEBVTT

00:00.878 --> 00:03.139
Mystic Falls...
I was born here.

00:03.259 --> 00:04.508
This is my home.

00:04.510 --> 00:07.645
- And mine.
- And mine.

00:07.964 --> 00:10.831
For centuries,
supernatural creatures
have lived among us.

00:10.833 --> 00:13.834
They were
vampires, werewolves,
doppelgangers...

00:13.836 --> 00:15.736
- Witches.
- And even hybrids.

00:15.738 --> 00:18.089
And then
there's Elena.
She's one of us now.

00:18.091 --> 00:19.807
Why am I acting
like this?

00:19.809 --> 00:22.677
There may be one chance
to save her...
Nice ink.

00:22.679 --> 00:24.729
Tell him what
the hunter told you
the tattoo leads to!

00:24.731 --> 00:26.247
He said
there was a cure.

00:26.249 --> 00:28.382
No one must know
about the cure,
do you understand?

00:28.384 --> 00:32.153
The hunter holds the key,
and he'll stop at nothing...

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074

00:53.742 --> 00:57.778
You have any idea
what I've been through?

00:57.780 --> 01:00.748
I spent the last
two days chained up
by an original vampire.

01:00.750 --> 01:02.600
So you met Klaus?

01:02.602 --> 01:04.101
I only know him
by reputation.

01:04.102 --> 01:06.020
Apparently he's
a real monster.

01:06.022 --> 01:07.888
He's a vampire-werewolf hybrid.

01:07.890 --> 01:10.107
Do you know how hard
it is to kill them?

01:10.109 --> 01:11.642
From what I gather,
you have to...

01:11.644 --> 01:15.479
Remove their head,
or their heart.

01:15.481 --> 01:17.898
That is, according to lore.
I'm just speculating.

01:17.900 --> 01:19.717
I had to figure out
how to do it on my own.

01:19.719 --> 01:23.504
I could have used some
of this occult Professor
knowledge of yours.

01:23.506 --> 01:25.239
But then again,
you've always been slow

01:25.241 --> 01:26.791
when it comes
to providing answers.

01:26.793 --> 01:28.442
We had a deal.

01:28.444 --> 01:29.961
I'll give you
answers about
your hunter's mark

01:29.963 --> 01:31.445
when it's grown
to completion.

01:31.447 --> 01:34.281
In other words, kill
as many vampires as possible.

01:34.283 --> 01:36.617
Come on, Connor,
why do you think I sent
you to Mystic Falls?

01:36.619 --> 01:40.638
There's no shortage
of vampires. That town's
practically infested.

01:40.640 --> 01:42.807
Listen, there's a witch

01:42.809 --> 01:44.659
mixed up
in all this.

01:44.661 --> 01:46.310
She's important
to what I have planned.

01:46.312 --> 01:48.980
I want her to be kept
out of harm's way.

01:48.982 --> 01:51.148
Anybody gets in my way--

01:51.150 --> 01:53.351
anybody--

01:53.353 --> 01:54.968
they're dead.

01:54.970 --> 01:57.605
Ok...

01:57.607 --> 02:01.492
Sure, I'll occupy
her myself.

02:01.494 --> 02:04.328
Just do what you do.

02:05.614 --> 02:08.164
And the less
I know about it,
the better.

02:46.905 --> 02:46.954
Do I have your attention?

02:50.959 --> 02:52.243
Good.

02:52.245 --> 02:55.212
Then let's talk about vampires.

03:05.090 --> 03:07.925
Dear diary,

03:07.927 --> 03:10.144
I know it's been a while.

03:10.146 --> 03:11.762
A long while.

03:11.764 --> 03:13.714
I haven't needed...

03:13.716 --> 03:16.550
I haven't wanted
to write this stuff down.

03:16.552 --> 03:19.403
But I don't want
to say it out loud, either.

03:19.405 --> 03:22.323
The thing is...

03:22.325 --> 03:25.225
I'm a vampire.

03:25.227 --> 03:27.411
And I hate it.

03:27.413 --> 03:30.281
She's been spiraling
since her transition.

03:30.283 --> 03:32.867
There are times
I barely recognize her.

03:32.869 --> 03:35.586
But now for the first time
in a while,

03:35.588 --> 03:38.071
there's hope.

03:38.073 --> 03:39.573
I feel hopeless.

03:39.575 --> 03:41.926
Depressed. Angry.

03:41.928 --> 03:43.928
But most of all...

03:43.930 --> 03:46.313
I'm scared.

03:46.315 --> 03:47.431
Somewhere
in the world,

03:47.433 --> 03:49.633
there's a cure for vampires.

03:49.635 --> 03:52.586
If I can get it,

03:52.588 --> 03:54.254
Elena can be human again.

03:54.256 --> 03:57.558
I can give her
back her life.

03:57.560 --> 03:59.643
Part of me
just wants to end it.

03:59.645 --> 04:02.113
But then I think
of Jeremy,

04:02.115 --> 04:05.566
and all that he has left.

04:05.568 --> 04:07.535
So, I need to find
a way through this.

04:07.537 --> 04:10.054
No matter what it takes.

04:10.056 --> 04:11.789
So that's
what I need to do.

04:11.791 --> 04:14.458
No matter what Klaus asks;

04:14.460 --> 04:16.610
no matter what lies
I have to tell,

04:16.612 --> 04:20.664
secrets I have to keep,
I'll do it.

04:20.666 --> 04:22.500
No matter what it takes.

04:30.870 --> 04:32.426
How the hell
did Connor escape?

04:32.428 --> 04:34.294
I blame mind-numbing
incompetence,

04:34.296 --> 04:35.963
but pointing fingers
isn't going to help me.

04:35.965 --> 04:37.314
You're going
to help me.

04:37.316 --> 04:38.649
Well, he could be anywhere now.

04:38.651 --> 04:40.133
Think, Stefan.

04:40.135 --> 04:41.519
He took
the hybrid's head,

04:41.521 --> 04:43.437
which means he wants
werewolf toxin.

04:43.439 --> 04:45.806
Which means he plans
to stay in Mystic Falls
to kill vampires.

04:45.808 --> 04:47.107
Which is a pity.

04:47.109 --> 04:49.109
Me being
on the other side
of the world

04:49.111 --> 04:51.311
digging up a dead
hunter, you'll have
no access to my blood.

04:51.313 --> 04:53.797
And therefore
the antidote.
Nevertheless,

04:53.799 --> 04:56.317
his tattoo is our
only map to the cure,

04:56.319 --> 04:57.651
so your task
is quite simple.

04:57.653 --> 04:59.653
Find him, catch him,

04:59.655 --> 05:01.455
and above all,
keep him alive.

05:01.457 --> 05:03.507
He's no good
to us dead.

05:03.509 --> 05:05.376
Damon's been looking
everywhere for him.
If they cross paths...

05:05.378 --> 05:07.127
You need to keep
Damon in check.

05:07.129 --> 05:08.946
It would be a lot easier
if I could just
tell him the truth.

05:08.948 --> 05:11.031
You trust Damon
with the cure?

05:11.033 --> 05:13.700
I imagine he prefers
Elena the way she is.

05:13.702 --> 05:15.636
Nice try, Klaus,
but I trust Damon

05:15.638 --> 05:16.971
a hell of a lot more
than I trust you.

05:16.973 --> 05:18.472
And I trust no one.

05:18.474 --> 05:21.342
Which is why my sister is lying
daggered in a box.

05:21.344 --> 05:24.511
The more who find
out about the cure,

05:24.513 --> 05:27.047
the more will
go after it.

05:27.049 --> 05:29.433
Nations have gone
to war over less.

05:29.435 --> 05:31.602
You mark my words--
tell one soul

05:31.604 --> 05:33.687
and I will throw
the hunter's sword
in the mediterranean

05:33.689 --> 05:35.656
and we can end
this quest right now.

05:35.658 --> 05:38.042
Am I understood?

05:41.363 --> 05:45.399
Really? Jeremy,
you're half an hour
late. Get here now.

05:48.837 --> 05:51.755
Uh, Matt?

05:53.625 --> 05:55.909
Uh, hey, April.
We don't open
till eleven.

05:55.911 --> 05:57.544
Oh, sorry. I wasn't, like,

05:57.546 --> 05:59.913
trying to scare you
or stalk you or whatever.

05:59.915 --> 06:03.550
I just, um, I came
to ask if you've seen Rebekah?

06:03.552 --> 06:05.786
Why would I have
seen Rebekah?

06:05.788 --> 06:08.472
Oh, I just assumed.

06:08.474 --> 06:10.557
I mean, aren't you guys
kind of line a thing?

06:10.559 --> 06:13.644
Rebekah
and I are not a thing.

06:13.646 --> 06:16.363
Well, I mean,
I'm worried about her.

06:16.365 --> 06:19.283
She said she'd help me
find stuff out about
the fire that killed my dad,

06:19.285 --> 06:21.535
and then she just disappeared.

06:21.537 --> 06:23.437
Trust me...

06:25.825 --> 06:27.708
That's the least
of your problems.

06:31.713 --> 06:33.497
Oh.

06:33.499 --> 06:35.749
Excuse me.
What are you doing?

06:35.751 --> 06:37.117
Where's Stefan?

06:37.119 --> 06:39.586
Ok, good morning to you, too.

06:39.588 --> 06:41.672
He's not answering his
phone and he's not here,

06:41.674 --> 06:43.340
which, you know,
big deal,

06:43.342 --> 06:45.592
we've only got
a killer vampire
hunter on the loose.

06:45.594 --> 06:47.561
I haven't talked
to him yet today.

06:47.563 --> 06:49.179
Hmm.

06:49.181 --> 06:52.583
Give me your phone.
Maybe he's dodging me.

06:52.585 --> 06:54.852
Why would he be dodging you?
Oh, I don't know,

06:54.854 --> 06:57.237
maybe the hot, sweaty
dance party business?

06:57.239 --> 06:59.440
I figured you spilled
your guilty little
guts to him

06:59.442 --> 07:01.141
when I left last night.

07:04.195 --> 07:06.664
Ohh, you didn't
tell him, did you?

07:06.666 --> 07:08.749
No, Damon.

07:08.751 --> 07:10.484
I didn't tell him
that I got high on blood

07:10.486 --> 07:12.336
like some crack head

07:12.338 --> 07:14.121
and dirty danced with you.

07:14.123 --> 07:17.124
It was a mistake, ok?
I wasn't...Myself.

07:17.126 --> 07:19.543
And besides, he's already
got enough to deal with,

07:19.545 --> 07:21.962
trying to get me through
this vampire stuff.

07:21.964 --> 07:25.999
Oh, I see. This is
classic shame spiral.

07:26.001 --> 07:27.601
I'm not in a shame spiral.

07:27.603 --> 07:29.970
Oh, you so are.
Newbie vampire remorse?

07:29.972 --> 07:31.972
Whoof, it's worse
than a hangover.

07:31.974 --> 07:34.224
I'm not in a shame spiral,
Damon!

07:34.226 --> 07:37.361
It's Stefan. Leave a message.

07:38.563 --> 07:40.314
So either he's dodging
both of us...

07:40.316 --> 07:41.865
Or something's wrong.

07:41.867 --> 07:44.451
Sit down. Sit down!

07:47.655 --> 07:48.855
Gilbert, give me
your cell phone.

07:48.857 --> 07:50.290
Look, at least
let April go.

07:50.292 --> 07:51.691
She doesn't have
anything to do
with this.

07:51.693 --> 07:53.293
She has everything
to do with this.

07:53.295 --> 07:55.129
Her and her father.

07:55.131 --> 07:57.314
Plus, she and I have history.

07:57.316 --> 07:58.799
What are you
talking about?

07:58.801 --> 08:00.868
I've never seen you
before in my life!

08:00.870 --> 08:03.587
You kids need
to get some vervain.

08:03.589 --> 08:06.557
And don't just wear it
as a bracelet where anybody
can just take it off.

08:06.559 --> 08:09.709
Maybe then you'd
remember our conversation
at the hybrid's yesterday.

08:09.711 --> 08:11.895
Our conversation?

08:12.981 --> 08:14.648
Are you saying
someone compelled me?!

08:14.650 --> 08:16.734
Will someone please
tell me what he's
talking about?!

08:16.736 --> 08:18.718
Compulsion. Secrets.

08:18.720 --> 08:21.271
Vampires.
If you know so much,

08:21.273 --> 08:23.440
then you know our
friends are going
to come for us.

08:23.442 --> 08:25.392
Oh, yeah,
I'm counting on it.

08:25.394 --> 08:27.277
Every vampire
that comes for you

08:27.279 --> 08:28.728
is another one
I get to kill.

08:28.730 --> 08:31.949
Now, who should I text
first, hmm?

08:31.951 --> 08:35.157
Damon Salvatore?
His brother Stefan?

08:35.277 --> 08:37.171
Tyler lockwood?

08:37.173 --> 08:39.173
All of the above.

08:50.130 --> 08:53.846
So we each take
a different entrance,
hit him at the same time.

08:53.966 --> 08:56.066
Stefan!
Where the hell have you been?

08:56.068 --> 08:57.852
Coming up with a plan?
Yeah, we have a plan.

08:57.854 --> 08:59.186
The plan is I'm going
to rip Connor's heart out

08:59.188 --> 09:00.604
and I am going
to feed it to him.

09:00.606 --> 09:02.239
That's not a plan.
We need to be careful.

09:02.241 --> 09:04.124
Connor has Jeremy
and who knows how many
other hostages.

09:04.126 --> 09:06.193
Hence the open heart surgery.

09:06.195 --> 09:07.828
Damon's right.
Connor's strong,

09:07.830 --> 09:09.763
but he's not going
to be able to take
all of us.

09:09.765 --> 09:11.949
I called in the hybrids
to help, too.

09:11.951 --> 09:13.951
My mom put squad
cars blocking
the streets.

09:13.953 --> 09:15.703
They're saying it's
a faulty gas main.
We're good to go.

09:15.705 --> 09:18.472
Good. Great. No cop,
no witnesses, no reason
to wait around.

09:18.474 --> 09:20.774
All right, hold on,
you're not all going.

09:20.776 --> 09:22.376
He shot me like 9 times.

09:22.378 --> 09:23.961
If we're killing him,
I want in.

09:23.963 --> 09:25.162
He's got Jeremy, I'm going.

09:25.164 --> 09:26.964
Listen, nobody
is going anywhere

09:26.966 --> 09:28.799
until I figure out
what we're walking into.

09:28.801 --> 09:30.901
Until <i>you</i> figure it out?

09:30.903 --> 09:32.686
Is that where you've been
all morning,

09:32.688 --> 09:34.138
out buying bossy pants?

09:34.140 --> 09:35.472
This guy's known for
setting traps, right?

09:35.474 --> 09:36.807
We'd be pretty dumb
to walk into one,

09:36.809 --> 09:38.342
especially if he has
werewolf venom.

09:38.344 --> 09:40.527
Does he?

09:40.529 --> 09:42.346
He's had it before.

09:44.266 --> 09:46.683
Fine. Fine.

09:46.685 --> 09:49.620
You want to take some time
to do recon, you get one hour.

09:49.622 --> 09:51.121
But we're going to need
some extra help,

09:51.123 --> 09:52.590
so where the hell's
the wicked witch of the west?

09:52.592 --> 09:54.458
She can't do magic.
Really?

09:54.460 --> 09:56.660
Well, call her,
tell her Jeremy's
life is in danger.

09:56.662 --> 09:59.296
Maybe that'll bring her
out of retirement.

10:06.004 --> 10:09.256
I can't believe
you wrote a book.

10:09.258 --> 10:11.926
I did. I wrote
three books,
actually.

10:11.928 --> 10:15.729
Two of them are just two
more to find to display.

10:15.731 --> 10:17.648
Oh, I'm finding them online.

10:17.650 --> 10:19.400
No, no, you're not.
Hey, come on,

10:19.402 --> 10:20.401
you promised, remember?

10:20.403 --> 10:21.852
Right? No cell phones,

10:21.854 --> 10:23.904
and no Internet
during witch therapy.

10:23.906 --> 10:25.389
Here. This is yours.

10:25.391 --> 10:27.608
Right now I want you to focus.

10:27.610 --> 10:30.160
And I want
your undivided attention.

10:30.162 --> 10:33.697
You really think
you can help me start
practicing magic again?

10:33.699 --> 10:35.399
Absolutely, I can.

10:35.401 --> 10:37.334
I invited you here
because I can.

10:37.336 --> 10:38.919
But you know what,
right now, just relax.

10:38.921 --> 10:41.038
Drink your tea.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.207
I got this in Australia
when I was backpacking

10:43.209 --> 10:45.125
with these aborigine
spirit guides.

10:45.127 --> 10:46.510
Trust me, it's better
when you smoke it,

10:46.512 --> 10:47.928
but I'm trying
to be a role model.

10:50.683 --> 10:52.032
Bonnie...

10:52.034 --> 10:53.583
Listen, the thing is,

10:53.585 --> 10:55.519
what I have in mind
might come off

10:55.521 --> 10:57.104
as a little unorthodox.

10:57.106 --> 10:59.606
Now I'm officially curious.

10:59.608 --> 11:02.109
Good.

11:02.111 --> 11:03.560
Ahh.

11:06.597 --> 11:09.199
What do you know
about hypnosis?

11:09.201 --> 11:10.668
You really think
that would work?

11:10.670 --> 11:12.119
What, you practice
witchcraft

11:12.121 --> 11:14.538
but you don't
believe in hypnotism?

11:14.540 --> 11:17.324
Bonnie, listen...

11:17.326 --> 11:19.043
You're afraid
to practice magic

11:19.045 --> 11:21.962
because those witch
spirits convinced
you it's wrong.

11:23.448 --> 11:24.715
They threatened
your grams

11:24.717 --> 11:26.550
and they made you
feel guilty.

11:26.552 --> 11:28.836
You just have to

11:28.838 --> 11:32.373
confront that fear...
And that guilt.

11:34.392 --> 11:36.593
And remove it.

11:36.595 --> 11:39.513
Maybe. I don't think
hypnosis would work.

11:39.515 --> 11:42.632
Witches are naturally immune
to any sort of manipulation.

11:42.634 --> 11:44.918
Really?

11:44.920 --> 11:49.306
Well, let me
ask you something.

11:49.308 --> 11:51.825
How'd you like to put
that earring back on?

12:01.520 --> 12:04.455
You expect me
to care about
bloody hostages?

12:04.457 --> 12:05.839
Well, you should.
Damon does.

12:05.841 --> 12:07.674
So does Caroline, Tyler, Elena.

12:07.676 --> 12:10.494
If any of them get
to Connor, then you just
wasted a trip to Italy.

12:10.496 --> 12:12.296
I can buy us some time,
but Damon's getting antsy.

12:12.298 --> 12:13.931
So if you want Connor alive,

12:13.933 --> 12:17.134
you better get your hybrids
onboard with my plan.

12:23.525 --> 12:26.110
Who is he talking to?

12:26.112 --> 12:28.695
Bonnie, hopefully.

12:28.697 --> 12:31.848
Maybe she's decided
to make herself
useful again.

12:34.152 --> 12:36.370
What is that?

12:36.372 --> 12:39.239
It's our way in,
courtesy of
Alaric Saltzman's

12:39.241 --> 12:41.625
interest
in the Mystic Falls
underground railroad.

12:41.627 --> 12:43.627
The tunnels, like the ones
in the lockwood cellar.

12:43.629 --> 12:45.712
Yep.

12:53.204 --> 12:54.871
What did you find out?

12:54.873 --> 12:56.373
I could only
make out the voices.

12:56.375 --> 12:57.508
How many
hostages?

12:57.510 --> 13:00.060
Three. But, Elena,
it's Matt.

13:00.062 --> 13:01.345
And April young.

13:01.347 --> 13:02.879
What?!
Those two idiots.

13:02.881 --> 13:04.314
They're like
danger magnets.

13:04.316 --> 13:05.549
We have to get them
out of there.

13:05.551 --> 13:07.017
Yeah, I just need
a little more time.

13:07.019 --> 13:08.602
The clock's ticking,
brother.

13:08.604 --> 13:10.971
You know, I could do without
the color commentary.

13:10.973 --> 13:12.773
I'm going
in these tunnels.

13:12.775 --> 13:14.491
No, you're not.
This guy doesn't know

13:14.493 --> 13:15.859
that you're a vampire.
Let's keep it that way.

13:15.861 --> 13:16.944
Well, maybe that's it.

13:16.946 --> 13:18.278
I can offer
to trade myself

13:18.280 --> 13:19.580
in exchange
for the hostages.

13:19.582 --> 13:21.331
No! Best case scenario is,

13:21.333 --> 13:22.566
now you're a hostage.

13:22.568 --> 13:24.401
Worst case scenario--
he figures you out,

13:24.403 --> 13:26.336
kills you on the spot.

13:26.338 --> 13:28.839
Stop treating me like
I can't handle myself.

13:28.841 --> 13:30.040
Alaric trained me,

13:30.042 --> 13:32.042
and I've been practicing
with Stefan.

13:32.044 --> 13:34.261
So what? Now you're
going to take on
a professional killer?

13:36.214 --> 13:38.398
Bang, you're dead.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.185
Now what?

13:41.187 --> 13:45.272
Head shot's no good.
It has to be the heart.
So now you're dead.

13:45.274 --> 13:47.357
Huh.

13:49.695 --> 13:52.446
For someone that doesn't
want to be like me,

13:52.448 --> 13:54.865
you sure are good at it.

13:56.034 --> 13:58.569
My brother's
the only thing

13:58.571 --> 14:01.488
that's holding me together
right now, Damon.

14:01.490 --> 14:03.657
If anything happens
to him...

14:03.659 --> 14:06.710
We'll get him out.
I promise.

14:11.449 --> 14:14.418
He's clearly
delusional.

14:14.420 --> 14:15.952
I mean, right?
All this--

14:15.954 --> 14:18.055
all this talk
about vampires?

14:18.057 --> 14:21.091
I--I mean,
he mentioned my dad.

14:21.093 --> 14:23.793
Hey, this guy's a nut job, ok?

14:23.795 --> 14:25.345
Don't let him get in your head.

14:25.347 --> 14:27.797
What if he knows
something?

14:27.799 --> 14:30.567
Jeremy...Did he say
anything to you

14:30.569 --> 14:32.636
about why
he's doing this?

14:32.638 --> 14:34.971
I don't know. Maybe.

14:34.973 --> 14:36.740
Maybe I just can't remember.

14:36.742 --> 14:38.909
Let it go. Jeremy!

14:40.311 --> 14:43.113
You said we had
a conversation yesterday?

14:43.115 --> 14:44.498
Mm-hmm.

14:44.500 --> 14:45.999
About what?

14:46.001 --> 14:47.367
We'll get into that.

14:47.369 --> 14:49.253
First, take a look
at my handiwork.

14:49.255 --> 14:51.588
Pick up some tips
from the hunter's trade.

14:51.590 --> 14:53.156
What is all that?

14:53.158 --> 14:55.926
The fluid is derived
from werewolf toxin.

14:55.928 --> 14:58.662
Trip the wire, bomb goes off,

14:58.664 --> 15:01.848
nails deliver a lethal dose
into the bloodstream.

15:01.850 --> 15:04.834
And what's the point?
What do you get
out of all this?

15:04.836 --> 15:07.971
You know, I used to think
that there was no "get".

15:07.973 --> 15:10.190
That I was just
supposed to "do".

15:10.192 --> 15:11.775
Kill vampires.

15:11.777 --> 15:14.811
That was until I realized
that the mark held the answer

15:14.813 --> 15:16.680
to why I'm the way I am.

15:16.682 --> 15:19.116
The more I kill,
the more it grows,

15:19.118 --> 15:21.368
and once it's complete...

15:21.370 --> 15:23.186
I'll learn my story, and--

15:23.188 --> 15:26.123
and all this will have
meant something.

15:27.292 --> 15:29.626
Hey! We're going to
have visitors soon.

15:29.628 --> 15:32.996
You two get
in the back.
Get up! Move!

15:32.998 --> 15:36.667
And before you think
about any other exits,
I got every door rigged.

15:36.669 --> 15:38.468
Got it?

15:42.707 --> 15:45.592
Stefan's on his way.
This will be over soon.

15:45.594 --> 15:49.680
Will it? I mean,
haven't we already
been here before with Jeremy?

15:49.682 --> 15:51.932
Isn't this why
we sent him to Denver?

15:51.934 --> 15:54.351
Well, we'll get him out
of this and we'll compel him
down to the Bahamas.

15:54.353 --> 15:56.687
Maybe he'll find
an island girl.

15:57.773 --> 15:59.523
Did you find
the tunnel map?

15:59.525 --> 16:01.108
Got it.

16:01.110 --> 16:02.693
It was in
his weapon's drawer

16:02.695 --> 16:04.894
with seven stakes,
a weird MacGyver crossbow,

16:04.896 --> 16:07.331
and the last remaining
vervain in Mystic Falls.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.581
So, how about we get
this party started?

16:09.662 --> 16:11.846
Not yet. Klaus is
sending one of his men.

16:11.848 --> 16:14.099
He'll take the front
and you and I can
take the tunnels.

16:14.101 --> 16:16.503
Since when do we
team up with Klaus
and the lollipop guild?

16:16.623 --> 16:18.636
Well, I already
told you, Connor
has werewolf venom.

16:18.638 --> 16:20.713
We need someone
to draw his fire,
the hybrids are

16:20.833 --> 16:22.108
immune to it,
so they're our best bet.

16:22.228 --> 16:24.175
Well, how are you sure
he even has werewolf venom?

16:24.177 --> 16:26.010
Why is Klaus involved,
Stefan?

16:26.012 --> 16:27.779
Oh, stop being
paranoid, Damon.

16:27.781 --> 16:30.198
Start telling
the truth...Stefan.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.016
Why is Klaus involved?

16:32.018 --> 16:33.351
Did he compel you?

16:33.353 --> 16:34.786
I am telling you
the truth,

16:34.788 --> 16:36.154
this is the best way
to get everyone out.

16:36.156 --> 16:38.523
What is with you two?
We're wasting time!

16:38.525 --> 16:39.857
You know what,
she's right.

16:39.859 --> 16:43.194
Screw your plan.
I'll kill Connor myself.

16:43.196 --> 16:45.130
Stefan!

16:54.507 --> 16:56.125
Why are you doing this?
Damon had the right idea

16:56.245 --> 16:58.544
with the tunnels,
but I'm not going to go

16:58.546 --> 17:00.178
in there if I can't count
on him to do it my way.

17:00.180 --> 17:03.998
If you can't count on him?
You just vervained him!

17:04.117 --> 17:05.601
Do you think he cares
about April or Matt?

17:05.880 --> 17:08.992
He'll get Jeremy out for you,
but then he'll go right after
Connor no matter who gets hurt.

17:09.113 --> 17:10.249
Then I'm coming
with you.

17:10.251 --> 17:12.117
You're not coming with me,
Elena!
You need my help!

17:12.118 --> 17:13.635
What if Connor attacks
and you have to defend yourself?

17:13.637 --> 17:15.053
And what if you kill him?

17:15.055 --> 17:16.454
The guilt will wreck you.

17:16.455 --> 17:18.290
You don't think that
I'm afraid of that?

17:18.291 --> 17:19.641
Of course I am.

17:19.643 --> 17:21.626
Stefan, I'm barely
holding it together.

17:21.627 --> 17:23.962
If Jeremy gets hurt--
we'll get Jeremy out, ok?

17:23.964 --> 17:26.131
I promise you. Elena,
listen to me, listen to me.

17:26.133 --> 17:28.817
This is the most
important thing

17:28.819 --> 17:32.304
that I have ever
asked you to do.

17:32.306 --> 17:34.823
I just need you to trust me.

17:34.825 --> 17:36.692
Please.

17:57.663 --> 17:59.348
Look, man, this guy
is dangerous.

17:59.350 --> 18:01.166
He's highly trained,
he's armed--

18:01.168 --> 18:03.051
I can handle myself.

18:03.053 --> 18:05.187
Besides, Klaus
asked me personally.

18:05.189 --> 18:06.722
This is a bad idea.

18:06.724 --> 18:08.991
Uh, who are you?
Who the hell are you?

18:08.993 --> 18:10.509
Caroline.

18:10.511 --> 18:12.527
Ohh. You're Tyler's girl.

18:12.529 --> 18:14.229
He told me about you.
I'm Haley.

18:14.231 --> 18:16.481
Well, Haley,
that's pretty crazy,

18:16.483 --> 18:18.567
'cause I haven't
heard a thing
about you.

18:18.569 --> 18:20.719
I've been staying here
a few days.

18:20.721 --> 18:22.004
Excuse me?

18:22.006 --> 18:24.056
I needed a place to crash,
Ty's a buddy.

18:24.058 --> 18:25.574
He was kind enough to offer.

18:25.576 --> 18:27.659
I know all
of Ty's buddies

18:27.661 --> 18:30.212
and I haven't heard
about you, so how
about we cut the crap?

18:30.214 --> 18:34.049
Yeah, I don't do teen drama.

18:34.051 --> 18:35.584
Take it up with Ty.

18:35.586 --> 18:37.753
Excuse me.

18:39.173 --> 18:41.340
Dean, you don't need
to do this.

18:41.342 --> 18:43.642
Stay out of this, Haley.
I'm going.

18:43.644 --> 18:46.895
Just listen
to her, man.
It's suicide.

18:46.897 --> 18:48.397
Klaus told you to take
Connor by yourself,

18:48.399 --> 18:50.065
and you can't even
fight back?

18:50.067 --> 18:53.568
You have to use
"non-lethal force"?
What the hell is that?

18:53.570 --> 18:54.903
Klaus gave me a direct order.

18:54.905 --> 18:56.321
It's too dangerous.

18:56.323 --> 18:58.357
That maniac
already killed Nate.

18:58.359 --> 19:00.225
You're not a hybrid,
you don't know
what it's like.

19:00.227 --> 19:02.727
Klaus asks for something,
you do it.

19:05.665 --> 19:07.282
Look...

19:07.284 --> 19:09.084
I'm a hybrid.

19:09.086 --> 19:11.787
I used to do
everything
Klaus said.

19:11.789 --> 19:13.288
But I don't anymore.

19:13.290 --> 19:15.073
You don't have to,
either.

19:15.075 --> 19:18.410
You think you can
stand up to Klaus?

19:18.412 --> 19:21.513
Here, prove it.

19:23.750 --> 19:25.517
Tyler, don't...

19:33.894 --> 19:35.777
Hello?
Hey, Klaus.

19:35.779 --> 19:38.563
Tyler. I hope
you're not
causing problems.

19:38.565 --> 19:41.233
I can do whatever I want.
I'm not sired to you anymore.

19:41.235 --> 19:44.602
Fair enough. Though
I do happen to know
your little secret

19:44.604 --> 19:46.438
about your time
in appalachia.

19:47.573 --> 19:49.441
What was
your friend's name?

19:49.443 --> 19:51.209
Haley, was it?

19:51.211 --> 19:54.129
You'd probably
prefer I kept
that to myself.

19:54.131 --> 19:55.613
I'm sorry, mate.

19:55.615 --> 19:57.666
Are you going to answer
or should I just assume

19:57.668 --> 20:01.253
you're back to being...
How did you phrase it?

20:01.255 --> 20:04.122
Oh, yes.
My little bitch.

20:07.643 --> 20:09.627
Ahem.

20:09.629 --> 20:12.514
Do whatever
the hell you want.

20:12.516 --> 20:14.566
That's it?

20:14.568 --> 20:17.152
You just back down?!

20:25.361 --> 20:27.662
We're closed.

20:27.664 --> 20:29.331
I want you
to free the hostages.

20:29.333 --> 20:31.500
I'll free them. As soon
as you give me what I want--

20:31.502 --> 20:33.118
you and everyone like you dead.

20:33.120 --> 20:34.786
What, so your hunter's
mark can grow?

20:34.788 --> 20:38.323
Yeah, I know all about that.
What it means. What you are.

20:38.325 --> 20:41.093
Listen, you free
the hostages and you and I
can have a little cat.

20:41.095 --> 20:42.844
Maybe I can tell you
about the brotherhood
of the five.

20:42.846 --> 20:44.713
That's a weak move.

20:44.715 --> 20:46.882
You must be desperate.
Think about it, Connor.

20:46.884 --> 20:49.184
Klaus saved your life,
he needs you alive.

20:49.186 --> 20:51.436
Aren't you
the least bit
curious why?

20:59.779 --> 21:02.013
When I was a kid,

21:02.015 --> 21:06.684
my dad used to tell me
these scary stories
about vampires.

21:08.204 --> 21:10.405
They're just stories.

21:10.407 --> 21:13.241
Not to that man out there.

21:13.243 --> 21:15.544
There's something
so familiar...

21:15.546 --> 21:17.129
About him.

21:19.767 --> 21:23.835
Look, this is
a messed up situation.

21:23.837 --> 21:25.703
The last thing
that you want to do

21:25.705 --> 21:27.756
is buy into
that guy's craziness.

21:29.892 --> 21:31.543
You're going to be fine.

21:31.545 --> 21:33.311
We're getting out of here.
What is that?

21:33.313 --> 21:36.548
There used to be
an exit through
the old wine cellar.

21:40.403 --> 21:43.105
They bricked it over.

21:44.323 --> 21:46.741
So that's it, then?

21:46.743 --> 21:49.411
We're screwed.

21:50.446 --> 21:52.414
No.

21:52.416 --> 21:53.898
We're not screwed.

22:15.087 --> 22:17.772
There's no sign of anyone.

22:17.774 --> 22:20.592
Stefan's coming at him
from the other side.

22:20.594 --> 22:21.893
He'll free the hostages,

22:21.895 --> 22:23.761
your job is to get
Connor out alive.

22:23.763 --> 22:25.397
And use caution, mate.

22:25.399 --> 22:27.616
He favors booby traps
and ambushes.

22:27.618 --> 22:30.602
Understood.

22:39.111 --> 22:41.129
You may be
a potential hunter,

22:41.131 --> 22:43.081
but you make one move,
I will break

22:43.083 --> 22:45.333
all 27 bones
in your hand.

22:45.335 --> 22:47.669
They're not all bad, you know?

22:47.671 --> 22:50.455
Some of them,
they're my friends.

22:50.457 --> 22:52.140
Friends, huh?

22:52.142 --> 22:54.809
Yeah, I had a friend
like that once.

22:54.811 --> 22:57.795
She got turned
by this vampire
I was hunting.

22:57.797 --> 22:59.631
He thought
it'd be ironic.

22:59.633 --> 23:01.132
What happened to her?

23:03.302 --> 23:07.138
I didn't want to hurt her.

23:07.140 --> 23:09.908
She promised that
she would keep it
under control, but...

23:11.644 --> 23:14.446
A vampire's like
a loaded gun.

23:14.448 --> 23:16.998
Eventually
it's going to go off.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
That's when I got this.

23:22.988 --> 23:25.357
So you killed your own friend?
Listen!

23:25.359 --> 23:27.659
If you're going
to be like me,
you need to understand.

23:27.661 --> 23:29.928
Vampires kill humans.

23:29.930 --> 23:32.497
Hunters kill vampires.

23:34.151 --> 23:36.601
We have company.

24:04.380 --> 24:06.331
Oh, my God.

24:06.333 --> 24:08.717
Shh, shh, shh.

24:33.951 --> 24:35.738
Follow this map.
Get out of here.

24:35.858 --> 24:37.887
Take her to Caroline's
so she can...
Ok.

24:37.889 --> 24:39.789
Stefan! That guy's armed.

24:39.791 --> 24:41.141
If you go out there,
he's going to kill Jeremy.

24:41.143 --> 24:43.727
No one's killing anyone. Go.

25:05.616 --> 25:07.834
Connor,
you don't have to do this.

25:07.836 --> 25:09.536
Stefan?

25:18.996 --> 25:21.047
Stefan, call me.
There was an explosion
at the grill.

25:21.049 --> 25:23.332
I need to know
what's happening.

25:25.771 --> 25:28.388
Damon. Hey.

25:28.390 --> 25:29.839
Can you get up?

25:29.841 --> 25:31.441
Oh, where's Stefan?

25:31.443 --> 25:33.059
I'm going to kill him.

25:33.061 --> 25:34.611
Ow-ow!

25:34.613 --> 25:36.029
Ow!

25:36.031 --> 25:37.947
He took your ring?

25:37.949 --> 25:40.066
Why would he do that?

25:40.068 --> 25:42.018
Ughh. Because he's playing us.

25:42.020 --> 25:44.037
All this stalling,
getting the hybrids,

25:44.039 --> 25:46.289
taking my ring, add it up.

25:49.027 --> 25:52.078
He's either made a deal
with Klaus or he's compelled.

25:52.080 --> 25:53.797
Then I need
to get in there.

25:53.799 --> 25:55.865
No, Elena, this guy
is dangerous!

25:55.867 --> 25:57.417
So am I, Damon!

26:01.472 --> 26:03.757
Then you need to be smart.

26:03.759 --> 26:07.393
He doesn't know
you're a vampire.

26:07.395 --> 26:09.879
You get as close as you can.

26:09.881 --> 26:12.265
And kill him.

26:14.235 --> 26:16.269
Connor, we can
end this right now.

26:16.271 --> 26:18.438
Just put down the gun
and come with me.

26:18.440 --> 26:21.124
Sure, come out.
I'll hand the gun over.

26:21.126 --> 26:23.026
Think about this,
no one has to die.

26:23.028 --> 26:25.445
I'll tell you everything
you need to know.

26:25.447 --> 26:27.247
I don't make deals
with vampires!

26:27.249 --> 26:28.498
Listen to me.

26:28.500 --> 26:29.866
If you die right now,

26:29.868 --> 26:31.951
then your whole life,
all that killing,

26:31.953 --> 26:33.503
it will all be
for nothing.

26:33.505 --> 26:35.738
I can give you the truth.

26:35.740 --> 26:39.575
Put down the gun
and let Jeremy go.

26:41.245 --> 26:44.264
Please!

26:44.266 --> 26:45.799
Don't hurt him.

26:45.801 --> 26:47.467
Come any closer,
he's dead.

26:47.469 --> 26:48.968
Elena, get out of here.

26:48.970 --> 26:52.355
He's the only family
that I have left.

26:52.357 --> 26:54.440
Just--just let him go.

26:54.442 --> 26:57.310
You hear that?
Your girl's watching.

26:57.312 --> 27:00.113
I will shoot the boy
right in front of her!

27:00.115 --> 27:02.649
On the count of three!

27:02.651 --> 27:05.618
1...

27:05.620 --> 27:07.453
2...

27:24.555 --> 27:26.472
Jeremy?

28:06.222 --> 28:08.023
I'm sorry, I...

28:08.025 --> 28:10.776
Hey, it's ok.

28:10.778 --> 28:12.134
You don't have to hide it,

28:12.254 --> 28:13.891
I know you're not
going to hurt me.

28:15.699 --> 28:17.809
How did this
happen, Jer?

28:18.205 --> 28:21.286
Why did Connor
come after you?

28:21.288 --> 28:22.789
He said I was like him,

28:22.909 --> 28:26.942
because I could
see his tattoo.

28:27.961 --> 28:29.258
His what?

28:29.378 --> 28:31.880
His hunter's mark.

28:31.882 --> 28:35.033
It's invisible
to everyone but me.

28:35.035 --> 28:37.759
Stefan and Damon
didn't tell you about it?

28:37.879 --> 28:39.565
No.

28:39.850 --> 28:42.507
Who else
knows about this?

28:42.509 --> 28:45.928
Well,
that's the thing.

28:45.930 --> 28:47.726
I don't even know.

28:47.990 --> 28:51.541
Apparently I was with Connor
all day yesterday,

28:51.543 --> 28:53.894
but I can't remember.

28:53.896 --> 28:56.546
Someone compelled me.

28:58.783 --> 29:01.385
I think I know who.

29:01.387 --> 29:03.620
Oww!

29:03.622 --> 29:05.555
Good work,
brother.

29:05.557 --> 29:07.724
It's over, Damon,
I have him.

29:07.726 --> 29:09.342
Not after what
I just went through.

29:09.344 --> 29:11.178
I had to punch through
a boiler room basement

29:11.180 --> 29:14.931
into a septic tank
to get into this
stupid tunnel.

29:14.933 --> 29:17.734
But it'll be worth it.
I'm taking him with me.

29:17.736 --> 29:18.935
That's the thing--
you're not.

29:18.937 --> 29:20.237
I don't know
what you're up to

29:20.239 --> 29:21.638
or what Klaus
has over you,

29:21.640 --> 29:23.323
but even if I have
to go through you,

29:23.325 --> 29:25.409
I'm going to kill him.

29:28.946 --> 29:30.580
Better back off, Damon.
Why?

29:30.582 --> 29:32.032
Because Klaus
wants him alive?

29:32.034 --> 29:33.533
This has nothing
to do with Klaus,

29:33.535 --> 29:34.651
you're just going
to have to trust me on that.

29:34.653 --> 29:35.919
Don't want to.

29:35.921 --> 29:37.587
Don't have to.

29:37.589 --> 29:38.955
Not gonna.

29:38.957 --> 29:42.275
You can give him
to me, brother.

29:42.277 --> 29:44.327
Run as fast as you can.

29:45.630 --> 29:48.131
You're not going to kill him!

29:49.467 --> 29:51.101
Why are you protecting him?

29:51.103 --> 29:53.937
Tell me.

29:55.807 --> 29:58.007
Tell me!

29:58.009 --> 30:00.060
Klaus will kill
anyone who knows!

30:00.062 --> 30:02.779
Then it has to be good.
Spill it.

30:02.781 --> 30:05.449
Spill it!

30:05.451 --> 30:08.017
Connor's tattoo
is the key to a cure.

30:08.019 --> 30:09.352
The cure for what?

30:09.354 --> 30:11.655
For her! For Elena.

30:13.691 --> 30:16.743
Klaus told you
there's a cure for vampirism?

30:16.745 --> 30:20.997
And if Connor dies,
then we'll lose it forever.

30:20.999 --> 30:24.367
I know it's crazy,
Damon, but it's hope.

30:24.369 --> 30:27.471
Do you understand me?
It's her only hope!

30:46.825 --> 30:49.860
You stay the hell
away from my brother!

30:52.180 --> 30:54.698
Look at you.

30:54.700 --> 30:57.734
So worried about your brother.

31:01.172 --> 31:03.740
And you're the biggest monster
he'll ever meet.

31:07.930 --> 31:10.547
You missed.

31:31.868 --> 31:33.769
This isn't working.

31:33.771 --> 31:35.321
It's not you.

31:35.323 --> 31:38.057
I just--I can't
get into hypnosis.

31:38.059 --> 31:40.442
Bonnie, what do you
think we've been
doing for seven hours?

31:47.485 --> 31:50.235
Wow, that's crazy.

31:50.237 --> 31:52.554
Look, I'm good
at this, ok?

31:52.556 --> 31:53.956
And trust me,
you're doing
a lot better

31:53.958 --> 31:55.824
than you were
when you came in
this morning.

31:55.826 --> 31:57.226
You know what?

31:57.228 --> 31:59.361
Proof.

31:59.363 --> 32:02.748
I bet that you can
light this candle

32:02.750 --> 32:04.533
as easily as I can
sign my name.

32:04.535 --> 32:06.835
All you have
to do is want to.

32:06.837 --> 32:08.487
I'm sorry.

32:08.489 --> 32:10.689
I just--I can't.

32:10.691 --> 32:13.542
If you can't...

32:13.544 --> 32:16.095
It's only because
you're afraid.

32:16.097 --> 32:19.181
You're afraid of those
spirits and what they
might do to your grams.

32:19.183 --> 32:23.102
But let me
tell you something,
Bonnie Bennett--

32:23.104 --> 32:26.472
you're stronger
than they are.

32:26.474 --> 32:29.692
You have a power
of your own

32:29.694 --> 32:31.310
you haven't even
approached yet,

32:31.312 --> 32:33.328
and you don't have
to be afraid.

32:33.330 --> 32:35.330
Of anyone.

32:37.751 --> 32:40.202
Say it.

32:40.204 --> 32:42.521
"I don't have
to be afraid."

32:42.523 --> 32:45.507
I don't have to be afraid.

32:46.710 --> 32:49.328
Now close your eyes.

32:49.330 --> 32:51.997
And mean it.

32:58.888 --> 33:02.441
I don't have to be afraid.

33:11.518 --> 33:14.753
Guess it wasn't good enough.

33:14.755 --> 33:18.073
Oh, I don't know.

33:45.802 --> 33:47.603
Elena...

33:53.611 --> 33:56.445
I need to bury him.

33:56.447 --> 33:58.497
I killed him,
I should--

33:58.499 --> 34:00.749
I should bury him.

34:06.840 --> 34:09.757
Hey. Hey, come on.

34:09.760 --> 34:11.293
Don't!

34:11.295 --> 34:13.094
I heard you
talking to him.

34:13.097 --> 34:17.616
Making some secret
deal with Klaus?

34:17.618 --> 34:21.002
You said you were going
to protect Jeremy!

34:21.004 --> 34:24.940
Keep me from...This.

34:26.943 --> 34:30.696
You said that I could
trust you, Stefan.

34:32.514 --> 34:34.283
Elena, it's
complicated--

34:34.284 --> 34:37.569
no, it's not
complicated, Damon!

34:37.571 --> 34:40.021
You want to know
why? Because--

34:40.023 --> 34:43.492
because he's dead now.

34:43.494 --> 34:47.545
You told me
to kill him.

34:47.547 --> 34:50.382
So I did.

34:52.552 --> 34:55.203
I killed--

34:55.205 --> 34:57.372
I killed someone.

34:59.343 --> 35:02.711
I k--I killed someone!

35:17.343 --> 35:21.413
I'm so...Sorry.

35:21.415 --> 35:23.832
I can't believe
Dean's gone.

35:23.834 --> 35:26.251
We could have
saved him.

35:29.539 --> 35:31.506
I apologize.
Am I intruding?

35:31.508 --> 35:33.759
Caroline,
it's not like that.

35:33.761 --> 35:35.677
I keep waiting
for you to make up
some dumb story

35:35.679 --> 35:38.380
so at least I can call you
a liar. Is that now?

35:38.382 --> 35:41.683
I'll let you two talk.
Thank you, how big of you!

35:45.371 --> 35:47.139
You have to understand--

35:47.141 --> 35:49.191
no, you don't tell me
what I have to do.

35:49.193 --> 35:52.811
I went through hell
when I thought you died.
I cried like an idiot,

35:52.813 --> 35:55.096
and this whole time,
you've been keeping
a secret from me

35:55.098 --> 35:58.099
about falling for some werewolf
in the appalachians!

35:58.101 --> 36:00.402
I never fell for her.
Oh, please.

36:00.404 --> 36:03.572
Caroline,
she saved my life!

36:03.574 --> 36:06.041
I almost died trying
to break the sire bond.

36:06.043 --> 36:08.210
Haley was there
for me. She helped me
get through it.

36:08.212 --> 36:09.711
But nothing else
happened!

36:09.713 --> 36:11.129
Then why would Klaus think that?

36:11.131 --> 36:12.331
Because I'd rather him

36:12.333 --> 36:14.549
think that
than know the truth.

36:17.220 --> 36:20.589
There are other
hybrids that need
to be set free.

36:20.591 --> 36:22.758
Haley and I
can help them.

36:22.760 --> 36:27.162
But if Klaus found
out about what
we're trying to do,

36:27.164 --> 36:30.131
he'd kill us all.

36:42.912 --> 36:44.613
Hey, Jeremy.

36:44.615 --> 36:46.448
Sorry we're so late.

36:46.450 --> 36:48.250
We had to take this
crazy detour.

36:48.252 --> 36:49.901
There was a gas leak.

36:49.903 --> 36:51.703
Yeah, I heard
about that.

36:51.705 --> 36:53.321
Yeah, and we had to stop by
Tyler Lockwood's house

36:53.323 --> 36:54.990
'cause we had
to see Caroline.

36:54.992 --> 36:56.708
We talked to her
for a little bit,

36:56.710 --> 37:00.679
but now I was thinking
maybe we could all
go get some coffee.

37:02.331 --> 37:03.932
But the grill is closed.

37:03.934 --> 37:05.667
That's...Weird.

37:05.669 --> 37:06.802
You know what,
it's ok. I, uh,

37:06.804 --> 37:08.169
I need to get home
anyway,

37:08.171 --> 37:09.354
'cause I'm feeling
a little...

37:09.356 --> 37:11.506
Over it today.

37:11.508 --> 37:13.642
I should probably
get home, too.

37:13.644 --> 37:15.193
Oh.

37:15.195 --> 37:18.030
All right, then.

37:20.283 --> 37:22.034
Hey, uh, April.

37:22.036 --> 37:24.286
Did you drop this?

37:24.288 --> 37:26.238
Oh, that's not mine.

37:26.240 --> 37:29.458
You sure?
Here, let me see
your wrist.

37:31.828 --> 37:34.246
Ah, thanks, but--

37:34.248 --> 37:38.050
I like it. I think
it looks good on you.
You should wear it.

37:45.558 --> 37:48.560
Are you ok?

37:48.562 --> 37:50.262
Yeah.

37:50.264 --> 37:52.514
I'm just sick
of all the secrets,
you know?

37:52.516 --> 37:54.816
Yeah, tell me about it.

38:02.325 --> 38:04.192
What's wrong?

38:04.194 --> 38:06.695
Nothing.

38:16.005 --> 38:17.923
How is she?

38:17.925 --> 38:20.258
Angry, full of guilt.

38:20.260 --> 38:23.378
Hasn't said a word to me
other than she wants
to be left alone.

38:23.380 --> 38:26.014
Is that my journal?

38:26.016 --> 38:28.583
Had to go through
six locks to get it.

38:28.585 --> 38:31.470
Needed something
to back up your insanity.

38:31.472 --> 38:33.188
Did you figure out
how to tell Klaus

38:33.190 --> 38:34.773
you lost a hunter and a hybrid?

38:34.775 --> 38:36.725
He's on a plane.

38:36.727 --> 38:39.945
Which means
I get to live
for another six hours.

38:39.947 --> 38:42.230
I got your back.
You know, when he
comes to murder you.

38:42.232 --> 38:44.816
Thanks. Thanks for not
saying anything to Elena.

38:44.818 --> 38:46.485
About what?

38:46.487 --> 38:48.303
A cure that we don't
have, can't find,

38:48.305 --> 38:50.872
and probably
doesn't exist?
You're welcome.

38:50.874 --> 38:55.110
She doesn't need to know
that she killed her chance
of being human again.

38:55.112 --> 38:57.612
Alleged chance.

38:57.614 --> 39:01.116
I believe him, Damon.
You didn't hear Klaus' story.

39:01.118 --> 39:03.668
I believed every word he said.

39:03.670 --> 39:06.922
Well, I'll remain
a skeptic for now.

39:06.924 --> 39:09.307
So what's your next move?

39:09.309 --> 39:11.843
He said there was
a brotherhood
of the five.

39:11.845 --> 39:13.528
Which means there are
other hunters out there,

39:13.530 --> 39:15.797
and I'm just going
to keep looking
until I find one.

39:15.799 --> 39:18.400
Sure, Stefan, since you asked,

39:18.402 --> 39:20.402
I'd be happy to go
on a suicide mission with you

39:20.404 --> 39:22.404
for a potentially
non-existent cure.

39:22.406 --> 39:24.573
Not a problem.

39:24.575 --> 39:27.576
Yet a couple hours
ago, you were ready
to rip my heart out.

39:27.578 --> 39:29.494
Because you were being
a pain in the ass.

39:31.114 --> 39:33.281
I just need one thing--

39:33.283 --> 39:35.650
why do you want to cure her?

39:35.652 --> 39:38.086
What kind of
question is that?

39:38.088 --> 39:40.172
Legitimate one.

39:40.174 --> 39:42.591
You want to cure her
because she's a vampire
and she's not cut out to be,

39:42.593 --> 39:45.010
or you can't love her
if she is one?

39:47.096 --> 39:49.931
I'll always love her.

39:49.933 --> 39:52.250
But she's not supposed
to be this person.

39:52.252 --> 39:54.836
I don't want her to be.

39:56.973 --> 40:00.008
Well, if I'm going
to ride this fairy tale
to its conclusion,

40:00.010 --> 40:01.960
let me be clear
about one thing.

40:01.962 --> 40:03.528
What's that?

40:05.481 --> 40:07.849
I'm fine with her
either way, brother.

40:07.851 --> 40:12.037
So if we do this,
we're doing it for you.

40:27.637 --> 40:30.138
Dear diary,

40:30.140 --> 40:33.308
today I did the thing
I was most afraid of.

40:33.310 --> 40:36.377
I lost control.

40:36.379 --> 40:39.764
I killed someone.

40:39.766 --> 40:42.734
I used to think the worst
feeling in the world was
losing someone you love,

40:42.736 --> 40:44.819
but I was wrong.

40:46.272 --> 40:50.992
The worst feeling
is the moment
that you realize...

40:50.994 --> 40:53.411
You've lost yourself.
