00:47.596 --> 00:49.662
- [girl] Beth, is it on?
- [Beth] We're rolling.

00:49.664 --> 00:51.298
[girl] Places, guys.
This one's for real.

00:51.300 --> 00:56.769
"For centuries, the dark hand of Narash has
been spreading across the borderlands,

00:56.771 --> 00:59.573
ruling with blood
and necromancy.

00:59.575 --> 01:04.810
Are you the chosen one to challenge
him, to crush his bones into dust,

01:04.812 --> 01:07.747
and pry out his innards
with the tip of your sword?"

01:07.749 --> 01:09.548
- [Meg] Beth, film me.
- [hisses]

01:09.550 --> 01:11.817
[Beth] Meg, you look like a boy.
[giggles]

01:11.819 --> 01:14.554
- Yes! I am the...
- That's my part.

01:14.556 --> 01:16.555
I just wanted to make
sure you did it right.

01:16.557 --> 01:18.691
This is the pivotal point
for your character.

01:18.693 --> 01:20.659
- Just let me do it my way.
- But I'm the director.

01:20.661 --> 01:21.828
- [Beth] Hi, Amy.
- [giggles]

01:21.830 --> 01:24.563
- [Meg] Okay, fine.
- [Beth] Try it again.

01:24.565 --> 01:30.003
"I am the rightful paladin. Tell me my path,
Lord Gillian, I shall fulfill my prophecy."

01:30.005 --> 01:34.039
"You must travel beyond
the catacombs of Eryx,

01:34.041 --> 01:38.177
through the valley of Guell,
and climb the denizen steps

01:38.179 --> 01:41.114
where no human has dared
to venture."

01:41.116 --> 01:43.116
"Ever dared to venture, yet."

01:43.118 --> 01:48.554
Uh, it's more like:
"Ever dared to venture, yet!"

01:48.556 --> 01:50.090
In order to continue,

01:50.092 --> 01:52.591
you must offer
sacrifice to Rian,

01:52.593 --> 01:55.661
a dark fairy
of the Killian order.

01:55.663 --> 01:58.265
"You must bring me
the dragon scale relic

01:58.267 --> 01:59.599
of the forgotten droids."

01:59.601 --> 02:01.134
- [giggles]
- Druids!

02:01.136 --> 02:02.903
Whatever.

02:02.905 --> 02:05.739
- "Do you accept?"
- "I am not afraid."

02:05.741 --> 02:09.743
She turned and said farewell,
floating bravely forth,

02:09.745 --> 02:13.515
on her long, unknown journey,
far away.

02:16.585 --> 02:18.718
- End book one.
- [girls clapping]

02:18.720 --> 02:20.754
[Beth] Hey, Jo,
do the epilogue!

02:20.756 --> 02:22.622
But we've heard it
a million times!

02:22.624 --> 02:24.660
It's my favorite part.

02:25.727 --> 02:27.663
The people have spoken.

02:28.329 --> 02:30.162
[sighs]

02:30.164 --> 02:34.333
[Jo] It is not enough for the brave
heroine to desire greatness.

02:34.335 --> 02:40.040
No, even the lowliest serf in the
kingdom may desire greatness.

02:40.042 --> 02:43.944
For our heroine to succeed,
she must demand greatness.

02:43.946 --> 02:45.979
To snatch it
from the powers that be

02:45.981 --> 02:48.948
and wave it over the parapet
for all to see.

02:48.950 --> 02:51.785
To prove
that she is their queen,

02:51.787 --> 02:56.926
and the magnificent rightful
heir to her birthright.

02:58.060 --> 02:59.529
[sighs]

03:00.628 --> 03:03.997
Uh, well,
thank you, Josephine.

03:03.999 --> 03:04.932
Oh, it's just Jo.

03:04.934 --> 03:08.100
You certainly gave us
an entertaining read.

03:08.102 --> 03:09.668
- [chuckles]
- [scoffs]

03:09.670 --> 03:12.805
Uh, listen,
it's not my taste per se,

03:12.807 --> 03:15.909
but I could see how it
could appeal to others.

03:15.911 --> 03:20.613
- What are you going for? Young adult fantasy?
- Uh, no.

03:20.615 --> 03:23.083
It can't be Y.A.
There's no love story.

03:23.085 --> 03:25.618
- It's not a love story.
- Then it's definitely a pass for me.

03:25.620 --> 03:28.755
- [Clarkson] Yeah, it's a pass for me as well.
- [Henry] Me too, sweetie.

03:28.757 --> 03:33.093
You have a very creative mind.

03:33.095 --> 03:37.297
But, there's something
missing in the authenticity.

03:37.299 --> 03:38.765
I can't hear your voice.

03:38.767 --> 03:39.965
It's not about me!

03:39.967 --> 03:42.334
All the same,
it's still gonna be a pass.

03:42.336 --> 03:43.172
Professor?

03:47.008 --> 03:49.242
Yeah, it's a pass
from me as well.

03:49.244 --> 03:50.343
Thanks.

03:50.345 --> 03:52.678
No, thank you.

03:52.680 --> 03:54.947
Really I...

03:54.949 --> 03:58.851
I appreciate you judging
my artistic aptitude

03:58.853 --> 04:02.791
on three pages
of my 400-page novel.

04:05.661 --> 04:06.862
Thank you.

05:08.457 --> 05:11.057
Hurry up!
The lava's rising.

05:11.059 --> 05:13.259
[woman] Is there any way you could
give me a one-time extension?

05:13.261 --> 05:16.129
- I promise, it won't happen again.
- My earring!

05:16.131 --> 05:19.499
Leave it! No! She just
spontaneously combusted!

05:19.501 --> 05:21.234
- We have to move on.
- Oh, come on.

05:21.236 --> 05:22.335
Jo!

05:22.337 --> 05:23.936
She chose her fate.

05:23.938 --> 05:25.804
We are not
going without her.

05:25.806 --> 05:27.473
[woman] Is there any way
you could reverse the fee?

05:27.475 --> 05:29.475
- Apollyon!
- [woman] Yes?

05:29.477 --> 05:30.509
[girls calling]
Apollyon!

05:30.511 --> 05:32.345
[woman] I'm sorry.
Can you just hold?

05:32.347 --> 05:34.213
- [phone beeps]
- I am here!

05:34.215 --> 05:38.251
From whence come you,
and whither are you bound?

05:38.253 --> 05:41.121
We have traveled
from the city of desolation

05:41.123 --> 05:44.790
- through the fires of purgatory, fighting beasts of the night.
- [gasps]

05:44.792 --> 05:49.732
- We seek access to the city of Zion.
- Ooh. Hmm.

05:51.099 --> 05:52.968
You may release
your burdens.

05:55.302 --> 06:00.073
But you must each sacrifice
one valuable to the altar.

06:00.075 --> 06:04.244
But choose carefully.
Be not selfish!

06:04.246 --> 06:08.381
Whatever you select
must be of great value.

06:08.383 --> 06:10.986
Good. Yes.

06:13.020 --> 06:15.121
- Hair?
- It's valuable to me.

06:15.123 --> 06:15.858
Hmm.

06:17.992 --> 06:20.195
Your castles await you.

06:22.030 --> 06:23.997
- Go!
- [Jo] Except for Amy.

06:23.999 --> 06:24.898
- [phone beeps]
- Oh.

06:24.900 --> 06:26.999
- Hey!
- Oh. Ah.

06:27.001 --> 06:30.271
Hello? Thanks for holding.
I'm so sorry.

06:36.511 --> 06:37.477
Hey, let me in!

06:37.479 --> 06:38.912
- [knocking]
- No! You cheated!

06:38.914 --> 06:40.345
You don't deserve
to be in the castle!

06:40.347 --> 06:42.381
- Just let her in.
- [Jo] She has to play by the rules!

06:42.383 --> 06:43.516
- [Amy knocking]
- It's just a game.

06:43.518 --> 06:45.888
- Let me in!
- [Jo] It's not a game to me!

06:46.987 --> 06:48.955
- Let me in!
- Let her in.

06:48.957 --> 06:51.523
- [sighs]
- All my sisters are allowed in my castle.

06:51.525 --> 06:53.228
[Meg] Mine too.

06:56.097 --> 06:58.100
- Oh, my goodness.
- This is so cool.

06:59.167 --> 07:00.035
Mine's pink!

07:03.003 --> 07:04.970
"Welcome to your castles
in the air.

07:04.972 --> 07:07.109
Fill them wisely.
Love Marmee."

07:12.179 --> 07:13.412
[gasps]

07:13.414 --> 07:17.917
- Jo, what's in your castle?
- [Jo] Well, I want a lot of things.

07:17.919 --> 07:20.319
- I, Jo March...
- [older Jo] <i>I, Jo March...</i>

07:20.321 --> 07:25.290
I, Jo March... I'll get out of this
town and move to the big city.

07:25.292 --> 07:28.528
I, Jo March, will be a
very successful writer

07:28.530 --> 07:32.131
and will buy a big house in the
city so we can all live together.

07:32.133 --> 07:34.199
[Meg] I don't want to
live with you forever!

07:34.201 --> 07:36.869
I want to get married
and have kids and...

07:36.871 --> 07:40.907
And have a nanny,
and a maid, and... a butler!

07:40.909 --> 07:44.276
- [Jo] Amy, that's stupid.
- [Meg] Hey, you can't judge other people's castles.

07:44.278 --> 07:47.213
[Jo] Fine.
Then I change the rules of mine.

07:47.215 --> 07:49.448
Only Beth and I are
allowed in my castle.

07:49.450 --> 07:50.884
[Amy] Hey!

07:50.886 --> 07:54.254
I, Jo March, will be
a very successful writer,

07:54.256 --> 07:56.122
and will visit
every single country

07:56.124 --> 07:57.924
and eat out
every single meal.

07:57.926 --> 08:03.028
Oh, and I will see every play and
musical and opera ever written.

08:03.030 --> 08:04.564
Or will be written
ever.

08:04.566 --> 08:06.435
[Beth]
I think that's too long.

08:08.102 --> 08:13.208
I, Jo March, will be a very
successful writer and will...

08:14.376 --> 08:16.878
do
all the things.

08:18.946 --> 08:20.415
[Amy] My turn.

08:22.316 --> 08:27.953
I, Amy March, will be...
a rich and famous painter

08:27.955 --> 08:30.355
so I can...

08:30.357 --> 08:33.325
buy whatever I want
and go wherever I want.

08:33.327 --> 08:34.928
[Beth giggles]
Amy.

08:34.929 --> 08:38.996
I, Margaret March, will have
a family of my own,

08:38.999 --> 08:41.470
and, um, just be...

08:42.537 --> 08:45.139
well, happy.

08:45.639 --> 08:47.075
[Jo] And?

08:48.409 --> 08:50.245
[Meg] And nothing.

08:51.345 --> 08:53.578
- <i>Beth?</i>
- [young Beth] <i>I, Elizabeth March...</i>

08:53.580 --> 08:55.383
I, Elizabeth March...

08:57.018 --> 08:59.218
[laughs]
I don't know what to say.

08:59.220 --> 09:01.923
[Jo] Just... think about what you
want to be when you grow up.

09:03.157 --> 09:06.291
[Beth]
Well, I think this is my castle.

09:06.293 --> 09:09.364
- The attic?
- Just being here with all of you.

09:10.465 --> 09:12.397
[Jo] Okay, Beth.

09:12.399 --> 09:14.166
Yeah, that's really sweet.
We'll take it.

09:14.168 --> 09:16.435
- [giggling]
- Let's make an oath.

09:16.437 --> 09:17.469
- Okay.
- Yeah.

09:17.471 --> 09:18.941
[Jo] All right.

09:21.209 --> 09:22.311
[sighs]

09:24.479 --> 09:27.181
To always help each other
reach our castles.

09:28.048 --> 09:29.484
No matter
where they may be.

09:31.652 --> 09:32.488
[sighs]

09:34.221 --> 09:36.457
[kisses]

09:40.595 --> 09:42.064
[kisses]

09:45.332 --> 09:47.733
- [men murmuring]
- [Freddy] "Everybody gets a prize" mentality.

09:47.735 --> 09:50.269
- [Henry] My principles could be...
- [Freddy] No. Not everybody wins.

09:50.271 --> 09:53.039
Hey, excuse me!
Excuse me.

09:53.041 --> 09:54.272
- Professor Bhaer.
- Oh, dear.

09:54.274 --> 09:55.040
Hey!

09:55.042 --> 09:57.275
- It's dragon lady.
- Professor Bhaer!

09:57.277 --> 09:59.112
- Good luck with that.
- I need to talk to you.

09:59.114 --> 10:00.713
Just Jo, with the
fantasy novel, right?

10:00.715 --> 10:04.150
It's a high-fantasy
mythopoeic fable.

10:04.152 --> 10:06.352
Sorry I'm not more
familiar with that genre.

10:06.354 --> 10:09.521
Yeah, neither was your panel
of patriarchs in there.

10:09.523 --> 10:12.025
Which, you know, I might expect
from some of those hacks,

10:12.027 --> 10:13.659
but not from you.

10:13.661 --> 10:15.328
Not from someone
with your résumé.

10:15.330 --> 10:17.597
It doesn't matter.
I will find my audience,

10:17.599 --> 10:22.200
no thanks to Columbia or Hooton
Muffin or however you say it.

10:22.202 --> 10:26.271
- I'm sure you will.
- You probably didn't even understand that the protagonist

10:26.273 --> 10:29.174
- is actually a girl who dresses up as a boy.
- I didn't.

10:29.176 --> 10:31.444
And when I was growing up,
I dressed up as a boy.

10:31.446 --> 10:35.113
I was inspired by my
"authentic self," you see?

10:35.115 --> 10:39.484
I really think you would have understood
that and possibly even enjoyed it a little,

10:39.486 --> 10:42.554
had you heard more than
a measly three-minute reading

10:42.556 --> 10:45.223
in a synthetic,
almost hostile environment,

10:45.225 --> 10:49.261
where the critiques were really more
about subjective capitalistic conjecture

10:49.263 --> 10:52.198
than a chance for writers
to be discovered.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.369
I'd be happy to read
more of your novel.

10:54.835 --> 10:56.169
You would?

10:56.171 --> 10:58.404
Oh, yes! Thank you!

10:58.406 --> 11:01.207
I've been wanting anyone...
everyone... to read it.

11:01.209 --> 11:02.275
Besides my sister.

11:02.277 --> 11:04.146
Freddy, by the way.
Freddy Bhaer.

11:05.680 --> 11:09.214
Here. Contact info,
title page.

11:09.216 --> 11:10.817
E-mail would have been fine.

11:10.819 --> 11:12.418
No.

11:12.420 --> 11:16.655
You have to hold the words,
let them seep into your skin.

11:16.657 --> 11:18.757
All right.

11:18.759 --> 11:21.229
I'll be expecting your call.

11:23.764 --> 11:24.600
[sighs]

11:25.700 --> 11:28.434
[horns honking]

11:28.436 --> 11:32.137
- [machine beeps]
- <i>Hey, it's Freddy. I'm just, uh, checking in.</i>

11:32.139 --> 11:35.474
<i>I haven't heard from you. I know
that notes can be overwhelming.</i>

11:35.476 --> 11:37.175
<i>Keep your chin up.</i>

11:37.177 --> 11:39.478
- <i>Let me know when you have another draft.</i>
- [beeps]

11:39.480 --> 11:42.583
[vibrating]

11:45.152 --> 11:49.457
Josephine? Good heavens, child. It
smells like a Turkish bath in here.

11:50.457 --> 11:51.626
[sighs]

11:53.561 --> 11:57.796
If you're going to quarantine yourself
in this room for weeks on end,

11:57.798 --> 11:59.431
the least you could do
is crack a window.

11:59.433 --> 12:01.467
The least you could do
is knock.

12:01.469 --> 12:04.402
Oh, I'm your employer,
and I'm supposed to knock?

12:04.404 --> 12:06.572
How very millennial of you.

12:06.574 --> 12:08.440
Dinner's at 6:00.

12:08.442 --> 12:10.476
- I don't want her to starve
- [growls]

12:10.478 --> 12:13.346
while you escape into
your Neverwood Forest

12:13.348 --> 12:15.247
or whatever
you're scribbling about.

12:15.249 --> 12:17.382
I will do my best.

12:17.384 --> 12:19.285
Well, I sure hope
that's enough.

12:19.287 --> 12:21.355
Love you too,
Aunt March.

12:27.928 --> 12:30.231
[sighs]

12:33.868 --> 12:37.236
<i>Honey, it's Mom, just wanting
to know how your meetings went.</i>

12:37.238 --> 12:42.942
<i>So exciting. I bet they were busy fighting over
who gets to publish Concord's own Jo March.</i>

12:42.944 --> 12:44.577
[chuckles] <i>Anyway, I
know you're busy,</i>

12:44.579 --> 12:48.383
<i>but just check in and let us know when
you're coming home for Christm...</i> [beeps]

12:49.584 --> 12:52.818
[Amy] This is going to be
the worst Christmas ever.

12:52.820 --> 12:55.621
All my friends at school
get a whole pile of presents,

12:55.623 --> 12:57.593
and we get nothing.

12:59.561 --> 13:03.828
Well, we each get one gift, and
that's more than most people get.

13:03.830 --> 13:05.564
You want to know
what I asked for?

13:05.566 --> 13:08.200
Do not say a bra.

13:08.202 --> 13:09.901
New paintbrushes!

13:09.903 --> 13:11.539
[Jo] There he is again!

13:14.975 --> 13:19.280
[wind howling]

13:20.648 --> 13:22.518
[Meg] I heard he just
moved here from Europe.

13:23.585 --> 13:26.618
Maybe he was forced
to move here,

13:26.620 --> 13:29.290
after stowing away on
the Trans-Siberian railroad.

13:30.457 --> 13:33.227
Marmee said his parents
just died in a car accident.

13:33.894 --> 13:34.993
He doesn't
have any siblings,

13:34.995 --> 13:39.534
- so now he has to live with his grandfather.
- How sad.

13:43.437 --> 13:45.306
He's kind of cute, though.

13:46.441 --> 13:48.607
I mean,
I guess, for an old guy.

13:48.609 --> 13:50.809
[laughing]

13:50.811 --> 13:54.247
I don't think I could
ever live in that creepy house.

13:54.249 --> 13:55.747
Mr. Laurence is so scary.

13:55.749 --> 14:00.019
Oh, maybe Mr. Laurence
isn't his grandfather.

14:00.021 --> 14:02.288
He's the new kid's
vampire mentor,

14:02.290 --> 14:05.290
and he's trying to tame
his ravishing appetite.

14:05.292 --> 14:08.426
- Wait, that is really good.
- [chuckles]

14:08.428 --> 14:09.728
We should do something
nice for them.

14:09.730 --> 14:11.766
- Maybe we could bake them something.
- [Amy] Yes!

14:14.002 --> 14:15.734
[gasps]

14:15.736 --> 14:20.673
[on radio]
<i>♪ Angels we have heard on high ♪</i>

14:20.675 --> 14:22.275
Ooh.

14:22.277 --> 14:24.843
Amy, let's wait till
everyone gets here, okay?

14:24.845 --> 14:26.344
But I'm starving!

14:26.346 --> 14:29.015
You continue to use
that word incorrectly.

14:29.017 --> 14:31.383
- You know what I mean.
- Actually, I don't.

14:31.385 --> 14:32.550
- Shut up, Jo.
- [Marmee] Good morning!

14:32.552 --> 14:35.320
Oh, it smells like Christmas
in here.

14:35.322 --> 14:36.822
- You're back!
- How was the shelter?

14:36.824 --> 14:38.991
- [Marmee] Well...
- There were so many people there,

14:38.993 --> 14:41.327
we didn't have enough
food for everyone.

14:41.329 --> 14:43.996
See Amy? Those
people <i>are</i> starving.

14:43.998 --> 14:46.899
But not if
they like cupcakes.

14:46.901 --> 14:49.334
- Oh!
- I'll grab my costumes.

14:49.336 --> 14:51.036
We can do
the nativity musical!

14:51.038 --> 14:54.842
Oh! No, no, no, no, no.
Not the cupcakes!

14:56.043 --> 14:58.444
Can we just be
a normal family

14:58.446 --> 15:01.546
and eat breakfast
and open presents at home?

15:01.548 --> 15:03.518
- [knocks]
- I'll get that.

15:04.951 --> 15:07.053
- Oh, hi.
- [Meg] Hi.

15:07.055 --> 15:08.688
- Hey, hi.
- Hi.

15:08.690 --> 15:09.954
- Oh!
- I think this one's yours.

15:09.956 --> 15:11.357
Yeah.

15:11.359 --> 15:12.992
- Thank you so much.
- There you go.

15:12.994 --> 15:14.559
Fat ol' Goob
is always running away.

15:14.561 --> 15:17.096
- Yeah.
- Dove? Where are you?

15:17.098 --> 15:18.930
Dove? I thought
you called him Goob.

15:18.932 --> 15:20.833
Oh, I'm Dove.
I mean, I'm Meg.

15:20.835 --> 15:23.468
But my family...
That's what they call me.

15:23.470 --> 15:25.670
I'm John Brooke. I live next
door with the Laurences.

15:25.672 --> 15:27.906
- Oh.
- You don't look like a Laurence.

15:27.908 --> 15:31.711
- This is my sister, Jo.
- Yeah, I'm just a family friend of the Laurences.

15:31.713 --> 15:36.848
Mr. Laurence hired me to tutor his
grandson. Math, music and whatever else.

15:36.850 --> 15:39.852
- That's nice.
- So the new kid has a manny.

15:39.854 --> 15:41.853
Nope. Just a tutor.

15:41.855 --> 15:43.421
Right. Okay, yeah.

15:43.423 --> 15:45.524
Well, uh, we have to go
help some poor people.

15:45.526 --> 15:47.126
- Oh.
- So we'll catch you later.

15:47.128 --> 15:48.093
Merry Christmas.

15:48.095 --> 15:49.962
- Mm, bye!
- Merry Christmas.

15:49.964 --> 15:52.964
- [man] <i>Goob, buddy. Get off the computer.</i>
- [Meg] Oops, sorry, Dad.

15:52.966 --> 15:54.900
- <i>Rascal.</i>
- [meows]

15:54.902 --> 15:58.136
- Come here, Goob.
- <i>What do you got for me, Amy?</i>

15:58.138 --> 16:01.506
Okay. This one
is Marmee's favorite.

16:01.508 --> 16:04.443
- <i>Wow.</i>
- She says it's very "ethetically" pleasing.

16:04.445 --> 16:06.846
- Aesthetically.
- Aesthetically. [chuckles]

16:06.848 --> 16:10.448
<i>Well done. Amy, that's beautiful.
You're getting so good!</i>

16:10.450 --> 16:12.751
[chuckles]
Thank you.

16:12.753 --> 16:15.420
- Did I show you this one?
- No. No, no, no. Your time is up!

16:15.422 --> 16:16.421
- Jo.
- No.

16:16.423 --> 16:17.589
Come on!
Time is up!

16:17.591 --> 16:18.958
- Move.
- <i>Hey, you guys.</i>

16:18.960 --> 16:20.458
Thank you.

16:20.460 --> 16:22.127
Hi, Dad.
Okay, really quick question.

16:22.129 --> 16:26.131
Uh, when you first cut into a
liver, is the blood that seeps out,

16:26.133 --> 16:28.467
is it more crimson or maroon?

16:28.469 --> 16:30.535
<i>Writing a murder mystery,
are we?</i>

16:30.537 --> 16:34.939
- No, it's a post-apocalyptic zombie thriller.
- <i>Whoa.</i>

16:34.941 --> 16:38.777
<i>Uh, crimson, I would say.
But I only operate on humans.</i>

16:38.779 --> 16:41.947
- <i>So I don't really know about zombie blood.</i>
- Okay. Thank you.

16:41.949 --> 16:44.650
<i>All right, listen up, girls.
I only have a minute left.</i>

16:44.652 --> 16:47.051
<i>Jo, I'm going to put you
in charge of the club this year.</i>

16:47.053 --> 16:48.487
<i>So here's your marching orders.</i>

16:48.489 --> 16:50.823
[clears throat]

16:50.825 --> 16:54.193
<i>Your first assignment of the year will
be to write your grievances every week</i>

16:54.195 --> 16:56.761
<i>and come up with a plan
as to how to fix them.</i>

16:56.763 --> 17:00.735
<i>That way, you can be strong,
kind, independent little women</i>

17:01.469 --> 17:02.535
<i>like your mother.</i>

17:02.537 --> 17:05.936
- <i>Is that clear?</i>
- Sir, yes, sir!

17:05.939 --> 17:07.842
<i>Good. At ease, soldiers.</i>

17:09.175 --> 17:10.376
<i>I love you guys so much.</i>

17:10.377 --> 17:13.511
- <i>Hey, where's my beautiful Marmee?</i>
- Marmee!

17:13.512 --> 17:16.682
- <i>I need to see her one more time.</i>
- Hi.

17:16.684 --> 17:19.684
<i>Ah, there she is.
Hi, Marmee.</i>

17:19.685 --> 17:22.619
- <i>I love you so much.</i>
- [girls] Love you, Dad!

17:22.622 --> 17:24.790
<i>Merry Christmas, you guys.
I miss you so much.</i>

17:24.791 --> 17:27.460
<i>I'll think about you every day.
I promise.</i>

17:27.462 --> 17:29.094
[all]
Merry Christmas, Dad!

17:29.096 --> 17:31.864
- <i>Take care of your mom. I love you.</i>
- [Meg] Always.

17:31.866 --> 17:32.734
<i>Bye.</i>

17:38.939 --> 17:41.008
[all sigh]

17:44.544 --> 17:49.514
<i>Fifteen! Sixteen! Seventeen!</i>

17:49.516 --> 17:51.183
Say it with me, ladies!

17:51.185 --> 17:56.821
[all]
Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty!

17:56.823 --> 18:00.494
All right. [blows whistle]
Fall in, soldiers!

18:02.964 --> 18:05.530
As Staff Sergeant
of the Pickwick Club,

18:05.532 --> 18:08.733
I request a read of the earthly
grievances of each of our members

18:08.735 --> 18:10.839
as requested
by our commander-in-chief.

18:14.574 --> 18:17.009
- Staff Sergeant Snodgrass.
- [clears throat]

18:17.011 --> 18:20.512
Your clothes and notebooks are everywhere
and when asked to clean it up,

18:20.514 --> 18:23.048
you launched an airborne Cabbage
Patch at Private Winkle's head!

18:23.050 --> 18:24.849
You're lucky
that you missed.

18:24.851 --> 18:27.086
With all due respect,
who's the lucky one?

18:27.088 --> 18:30.591
- Soldier...
- Apologies, Private. Duly noted.

18:32.859 --> 18:35.793
- [clears throat]
- Corporal Tupman.

18:35.795 --> 18:38.630
Though we love
your feline companion,

18:38.632 --> 18:41.799
we request that you fulfill
your kitty litter duties

18:41.801 --> 18:46.004
and pick up the litter box since the stench
is considered to be highly offensive.

18:46.006 --> 18:47.508
Can do, sir.

18:49.810 --> 18:55.813
Private Winkle. It has been reported
that on multiple occasions,

18:55.815 --> 18:58.951
you have stolen toilet paper
out of the latrine,

18:58.953 --> 19:02.053
with the express purpose
of stuffing your shirt.

19:02.055 --> 19:03.155
- [giggles]
- You are so mean!

19:03.157 --> 19:05.057
On the contrary.

19:05.059 --> 19:09.294
We wish only to help you enjoy
your youthful freedom,

19:09.296 --> 19:14.332
for you will soon come to know the cumbersome
and unwieldy nature of a full chest.

19:14.334 --> 19:16.702
- Like you would know.
- Private Winkle!

19:16.704 --> 19:18.169
[sighs, clears throat]

19:18.171 --> 19:20.271
General Pickwick!

19:20.273 --> 19:23.876
It has been noted that you have
not visited the shelter all week

19:23.878 --> 19:27.245
because of frequent flirtations
with the manny.

19:27.247 --> 19:29.280
So you must go twice
next week.

19:29.282 --> 19:30.886
Sir, yes, sir.

19:33.721 --> 19:38.123
- [Aunt March] Josephine, what on earth is going on here?
- [dog whining]

19:38.125 --> 19:42.828
Wha... Sorry. I'm... I'm just, uh... trying
to lay everything out, see everything.

19:42.830 --> 19:44.629
I'm not talking about
your little story.

19:44.631 --> 19:48.200
I'm talking about the fact that
Katinka's water bowl is bone dry,

19:48.202 --> 19:49.335
and she pooped
in the entryway.

19:49.337 --> 19:53.038
- Serious? I just took her out.
- When? Last Christmas?

19:53.040 --> 19:57.976
- What am I paying you for?
- I'm sorry my life doesn't revolve around your dog.

19:57.978 --> 20:01.012
Well, what does it revolve
around, exactly? Hmm?

20:01.014 --> 20:05.020
Trolls? Dragons?
Cross-dressing pirates?

20:06.853 --> 20:09.221
I don't mean
to hurt your feelings.

20:09.223 --> 20:11.255
I'm just worried
about you is all.

20:11.257 --> 20:15.194
Is this really the life you want?
The life of... insecurity?

20:15.196 --> 20:16.761
Yes.

20:16.763 --> 20:19.164
What if the professor
doesn't like this version

20:19.166 --> 20:20.098
or the next?

20:20.100 --> 20:22.734
- He will.
- I hate to see you working so hard

20:22.736 --> 20:24.703
when it could all
come to nothing.

20:24.705 --> 20:27.639
There's no shame
in changing your mind.

20:27.641 --> 20:30.709
You're still...
youngish.

20:30.711 --> 20:34.178
It's not too late to pursue something
with a little more promise in it.

20:34.180 --> 20:38.049
I know it doesn't look
like much right now,

20:38.051 --> 20:40.251
but you are going to be sorry
you ever doubted me.

20:40.253 --> 20:41.990
I certainly hope so.

20:45.392 --> 20:47.628
Just think about a
plan "B." [kisses]

20:56.771 --> 20:59.905
- I knew it. You hate the new beginning.
- No.

20:59.907 --> 21:02.875
I liked it.
A lot, actually.

21:02.877 --> 21:05.180
But then I've always been a
fan of <i>A Wrinkle in Time.</i>

21:06.379 --> 21:09.848
I am trying to get
inspired by the greats.

21:09.850 --> 21:11.817
Isn't that what artists do?

21:11.819 --> 21:13.018
Yes.

21:13.020 --> 21:15.154
And then they tell
their own stories.

21:15.156 --> 21:17.955
- Was it at least better than the last time you read it?
- It was.

21:17.957 --> 21:19.660
But...

21:20.160 --> 21:22.895
Am I a hopeless case?

21:22.897 --> 21:26.098
Please just tell me now.
Save me the heartache.

21:26.100 --> 21:28.901
You know, there are
other things I could do.

21:28.903 --> 21:31.436
I do have
marketable skills.

21:31.438 --> 21:34.306
I could be a nanny
till the day I croak.

21:34.308 --> 21:39.778
I love books. I-I should be
an old spinster librarian

21:39.780 --> 21:42.815
who reads saucy romance
novels under her desk.

21:42.817 --> 21:44.051
I'm sure you'll
find time for both.

21:45.218 --> 21:46.085
You are not helping!

21:46.087 --> 21:49.954
I'm not your therapist.
I'm your editor.

21:49.956 --> 21:51.824
I'm not going to pity an artist
for taking their stripes.

21:51.826 --> 21:55.094
You signed up for this struggle the
moment you called yourself a writer.

21:55.096 --> 21:58.030
I have a feeling you'd
be bored with anything less.

21:58.032 --> 22:02.334
[sighs] You're good, Jo.
You're a good writer.

22:02.336 --> 22:05.771
But now that I've gotten
to know you, as a person,

22:05.773 --> 22:08.072
you are far more interesting
than what you write.

22:08.074 --> 22:11.011
I want to be reading...
more of this.

22:13.214 --> 22:14.480
More of you.

22:14.482 --> 22:16.084
Me?

22:16.817 --> 22:19.417
I am not
interesting!

22:19.419 --> 22:20.586
Hell,
I'm 29 years old.

22:20.588 --> 22:23.888
And I live alone in Queens while
I work for my great aunt.

22:23.890 --> 22:25.257
I still haven't been to Europe.

22:25.259 --> 22:27.859
I haven't been marooned
on a desert island.

22:27.861 --> 22:30.796
I haven't been falsely
accused of murder.

22:30.798 --> 22:32.865
I haven't even been
a victim of identify theft!

22:32.867 --> 22:36.801
If... If my younger self
could see me now,

22:36.803 --> 22:41.875
she'd straight up join a nunnery because
at least then her life would have purpose.

22:43.144 --> 22:47.011
Actually,
that is not a bad idea.

22:47.013 --> 22:49.147

doesn't always have to be about your work.

23:15.341 --> 23:18.810
- I need a nose job.
- Take that ridiculous thing off.

23:18.812 --> 23:21.879
You don't know what it's like to have
everyone else make fun of your nose.

23:21.881 --> 23:26.151
What is it gonna be like when you cut off
your circulation and your nose falls off?

23:26.153 --> 23:28.419
- You'd look like Voldemort.
- [Jo] Oh! That would be awesome.

23:28.421 --> 23:32.124
- [chuckles]
- Why can't I go to the New Year's Eve party?

23:32.126 --> 23:34.158
You can go to all the parties
you want when you're older.

23:34.160 --> 23:38.096
For now, you can stay home and watch
the ball drop with Marmee and Beth.

23:38.098 --> 23:41.332
- Does that sound like any fun to you?
- Yes.

23:41.334 --> 23:43.100
It's not.
I'm the worst.

23:43.102 --> 23:44.903
I always fall asleep
before midnight.

23:44.905 --> 23:49.407
Yeah! You see what I mean?
Beth is so boring!

23:49.409 --> 23:52.376
And I could care less
about watching a ball drop.

23:52.378 --> 23:54.546
- [Beth] Couldn't care less.
- What's the difference?

23:54.548 --> 23:58.416
Well, if you could care less, that means you
care a little bit about the ball dropping.

23:58.418 --> 24:01.319
- I don't.
- Okay, look. I think you're lucky.

24:01.321 --> 24:04.056
I would rather pass a kidney stone
than go to this freakin' party.

24:04.058 --> 24:06.023

- Meg, Meg, Meg.
- [Beth] Say "sorry"!

24:31.084 --> 24:33.388
[Amy] You can just cover
it up with a headband.

24:36.490 --> 24:39.023
You still look
so pretty.

24:39.025 --> 24:40.524

You can match Meg.

gives me the weirdest looks.

I'm sick of being the weird

33:42.002 --> 33:44.769
The March sister who's going to get
the New Year's Eve kiss from me...

33:44.771 --> 33:46.507
is...

33:48.975 --> 33:50.074
Goob!

33:50.076 --> 33:51.776
[girls laughing]

33:51.778 --> 33:56.580
At this time, I wish to propose
a new member to the club.

33:56.582 --> 33:59.184
- What?
- This nominee...

33:59.186 --> 34:03.887
deserves a chance and would be
deeply grateful to join our ranks.

34:03.889 --> 34:06.057
- Goob.
- No. No.

34:06.059 --> 34:11.195
Further, I believe this soldier will
add a unique voice to the platoon.

34:11.197 --> 34:12.663
[all]
Who?

34:12.665 --> 34:16.867
I nominate
Mr. Laurie Laurence.

34:16.869 --> 34:20.871
- Mm-hmm.
- No! No, no, no. That would be so embarrassing!

34:20.873 --> 34:23.208
I agree with Amy.
I mean, Private Winkle.

34:23.210 --> 34:24.275
He would just make fun of us.

34:24.277 --> 34:28.813
I give my word, as a soldier,
and as Staff Sergeant

34:28.815 --> 34:32.916
that he will not make fun of
our grievances or our oaths.

34:32.918 --> 34:35.954
He wants nothing more than
to be a full part of the PC!

34:35.956 --> 34:38.857
He's like our brother!
Guys, we have to do it!

34:38.859 --> 34:41.960
- What if he tells Brooke?
- I promise I won't tell a soul!

34:41.962 --> 34:43.895
- Traitor!
- [Meg] You've been in there the whole time?

34:43.897 --> 34:46.063
- I hardly heard anything.
- You heard everything!

34:46.065 --> 34:50.567
My fellow comrades. I come to you
as a lowly Private First Class!

34:50.569 --> 34:53.570
A faithful friend
and a keeper of secrets.

34:53.572 --> 34:57.478
As a token of my appreciation for your
consideration, I have brought you this.

35:03.049 --> 35:04.616
Whoa.

35:04.618 --> 35:07.619
[Meg] What is it? A birdhouse?

35:07.621 --> 35:11.088
- What's it for?
- Every club needs a secret mailbox.

35:11.090 --> 35:15.659
To keep our correspondence safely in
the hedge between our two nations.

35:15.661 --> 35:20.067
This one is for secrets,
never to be told.

35:24.904 --> 35:26.040
An alliance then?

35:27.907 --> 35:29.873
Well, then, Private.

35:29.875 --> 35:31.078
As General, I say...

35:40.219 --> 35:43.755
She said she's not interested
in "primitive rituals."

35:43.757 --> 35:46.891
Tonight is going to be
anything but primitive.

35:46.893 --> 35:49.594
Oh!
Your step-mom is the best!

35:49.596 --> 35:51.098
I know, right?

35:53.299 --> 35:55.632
That's a cute little dress.

35:55.634 --> 35:58.538
- It was my grandma's.
- How couture.

35:59.239 --> 36:01.940
Just throwing this
out there.

36:01.942 --> 36:06.679
I think I might have something
a little bit more flattering.

36:07.913 --> 36:09.646
Totally goes with our color
scheme, don't you think?

36:09.648 --> 36:10.815
- Um...
- Here.

36:10.817 --> 36:12.250
You definitely have
the body for it.

36:12.252 --> 36:14.918
Yes, I would kill
for that stomach.

- Face it, Meg. You're hot.

36:16.790 --> 36:19.257

- Can I come?
- No.

- Because we don't want you to come.

- [Laurie] That's not true.
- No.

41:38.011 --> 41:39.210
She's not coming.

41:39.212 --> 41:42.212
I'm not a kid. You don't get
to tell me what to do anymore!

41:42.214 --> 41:46.516
Actually, you are. By definition, in fact.
Look it up.

see a movie with Laurie.

You wanna go to Scoops maybe?

42:16.415 --> 42:19.150
[Jo] Laurie, no. I don't have time
to go get ice cream right now.

42:19.152 --> 42:21.518
- I am so inspired by that movie!
- [Laurie laughs]

42:21.520 --> 42:23.688
Inspired? I thought you
said you hated it.

42:23.690 --> 42:27.458
I did. But it just inspired
me to write something better.

42:27.460 --> 42:30.527
'Cause if that crap is
getting made into movies,

42:30.529 --> 42:32.429

going to crush it.

Oh, I thought you were
a novelist, not a screenwriter.

42:34.567 --> 42:37.201
I am. I just... I'm gonna do both.
How hard can it be?

42:37.203 --> 42:39.302
Have you seen my notebook?

42:39.304 --> 42:41.572
You know, I don't know why you
don't just use my old laptop.

42:41.574 --> 42:45.041
What would happen if it randomly
deleted all of my work?

42:45.043 --> 42:47.978
But a hard copy,
you never lose.

42:47.980 --> 42:52.315
- Well, except for right now.
- It is not lost. It is misplaced.

42:52.317 --> 42:55.288
Okay, uh, guess I'll...
see you later then?

42:55.989 --> 42:57.958
Okay, bye.

- Open the door, you little brat!
- You should have let me come!

43:21.214 --> 43:24.014
- No one wanted you there!
- Laurie said he did!

43:24.016 --> 43:27.550
He also said he liked your paintings,
but he lied so you don't cry about it.

43:27.552 --> 43:32.088
[grunts] Why do you have
to be so difficult?

43:32.090 --> 43:34.425
- He's my friend too!
- No, he's not.

just like the rest of us do.

- I'm going to kill you!
- [screams]

43:53.311 --> 43:55.579
- What's going on?
- She burned it!

43:55.581 --> 43:57.148
Burned what?
Put that down!

43:57.150 --> 43:59.386
My notebook!
What is wrong with you?

44:01.753 --> 44:04.123
You! Go to your room.

Honey.

44:12.665 --> 44:17.268
I'm sorry. Hey...

44:17.270 --> 44:20.206
I will never write
like that again!

44:25.411 --> 44:28.545
I know you're angry
right now and I get it.

44:28.547 --> 44:30.581
It's going to
take some time to heal.

44:30.583 --> 44:32.516
But I promise you,

44:32.518 --> 44:37.224
the longer it takes for you to forgive
her, the longer your pain will last.

a wild ride into the sunset?

44:45.464 --> 44:47.130

44:53.239 --> 44:55.572
What? Do you think
I want to ride with you?

44:55.574 --> 44:57.608
- It's either this or we can't go.
- Fine.

- [Laurie] Jo, you don't think...
- No.

46:29.969 --> 46:32.405
- [Laurie] There's no way.
- She's back at the barn.

46:35.407 --> 46:37.409
- Amy!
- [Laurie] Hey, Amy!

46:37.909 --> 46:39.311
Amy!

46:40.246 --> 46:42.612
Amy, yell if you can hear me.

46:42.614 --> 46:44.717
- [whinnies]
- Saddle.

46:47.652 --> 46:48.754
Amy?

46:49.889 --> 46:51.491
- Amy?
- Amy!

46:51.824 --> 46:53.426
Amy!

46:54.793 --> 46:57.364
Amy. No. No, no, no.

46:57.830 --> 46:59.362
Help me.
Please.

46:59.364 --> 47:01.965
[Laurie]
Easy, easy. Amy.

47:01.967 --> 47:04.235
- Amy!
- Easy. Easy, easy.

47:04.237 --> 47:06.436
Oh, my God.

47:06.438 --> 47:07.804
Amy.

47:07.806 --> 47:08.973
Amy!

47:08.975 --> 47:11.541
Jo, it's okay.
Hold this. Hold this on her.

47:11.543 --> 47:13.576
Hold it right there. I'm
gonna go get some help.

47:13.578 --> 47:16.515
- No. Amy. [sobbing]
- It's okay.

47:20.018 --> 47:23.587
- Amy.
- Come on.

47:23.589 --> 47:24.590
Amy.

47:25.525 --> 47:29.196
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

47:33.766 --> 47:37.604
Please.
Help.

47:40.306 --> 47:43.340
[crying]
Amy.

47:43.342 --> 47:45.009
[Amy] I just wanted
to come with you.

47:45.011 --> 47:47.911
I know.
I should have let you.

47:47.913 --> 47:49.947
I'm sorry
I destroyed your journal.

47:49.949 --> 47:52.549
I don't care
about the journal.

47:52.551 --> 47:54.617
Okay, I so cared
about the journal.

47:54.619 --> 47:56.690
It was my entire life's work.
How can I not?

47:58.023 --> 48:03.893
But, I'd rather lose every word
I ever wrote than lose you.

48:03.895 --> 48:05.628
[chuckles]
That's a lot of words.

48:05.630 --> 48:07.701
I'll write a heck
of a lot more.

48:11.002 --> 48:13.505
Maybe this will help.

48:13.938 --> 48:15.375
Amy.
[scoffs]

48:16.942 --> 48:19.909
I know that sometimes you might
not like me much, but...

48:19.911 --> 48:21.679
No.

48:21.681 --> 48:23.547
Do not say that.

48:23.549 --> 48:26.349
We are just...
different.

48:26.351 --> 48:27.684
<i>And know what 'tis to pity.</i>

48:27.686 --> 48:31.755
Let gentleness
my strong enforcement be,

48:31.757 --> 48:36.626
in the which hope
I blush and hide my sword.

48:36.628 --> 48:39.663
True it is that
we have seen better days

48:39.665 --> 48:43.670
and have with holy bell
been knolled to church.

48:45.571 --> 48:48.005
I like watching
the rehearsals.

48:48.007 --> 48:49.806
Well, the Duke
needs to step it up.

48:49.808 --> 48:50.708
He's still
not off book.

48:50.710 --> 48:53.780
Just let the creative
process inspire you.

48:55.114 --> 48:57.947
Or just try to enjoy it.

48:57.949 --> 49:02.386
I will have you know I love plays,
I just hate this monologue.

49:02.388 --> 49:04.657
What? How? Why?
It's beautiful.

49:05.857 --> 49:08.494
Beautiful?
It's depressing.

49:09.462 --> 49:11.728
All the world's a stage

49:11.730 --> 49:14.398
and all the men and women
merely players.

49:14.400 --> 49:16.366
[Jo with actor] They have
their exits and entrances,

49:16.368 --> 49:19.902
and one man in his time
plays many parts.

49:19.904 --> 49:23.440
It is one of Bill's
most depressing soliloquies.

49:23.442 --> 49:29.112
I like to think a life is a bit more
meaningful than playing a part on a stage.

49:29.114 --> 49:34.016
Shining morning face creeping like
a snail unwillingly to school.

49:34.018 --> 49:36.322
- I don't see it that way at all.
- No?

49:38.456 --> 49:40.659
Please enlighten me,
Professor Bhaer.

49:42.594 --> 49:45.596
I think it's about growth
and accepting change.

49:45.598 --> 49:47.197
We come into this world perfect.

49:47.199 --> 49:52.469
Then we go through all these stages of
learning, shifting, changing, breaking even.

49:52.471 --> 49:54.570
And we become
something new,

49:54.572 --> 49:59.545
something... far from perfect
but perfectly unique.

50:01.781 --> 50:03.514
I find that inspiring.

50:03.516 --> 50:06.750
I guess that is one way
to think about it.

50:06.752 --> 50:12.489
"Last scene of all, that
ends this strange history,

50:12.491 --> 50:14.958
is second childishness
and mere oblivion,

50:14.960 --> 50:20.532
sans teeth, sans taste,
sans every... thing."

50:22.168 --> 50:23.534
[Laurie] <i>I'm scared.</i>

50:23.536 --> 50:26.103
You have a hundred letters in your hand.
Open 'em. One will be a yes.

50:26.105 --> 50:29.038
I still can't believe
you only applied to one school.

50:29.040 --> 50:31.741
When you're meant for the best,
you don't settle for less.

50:31.743 --> 50:34.076
I'd settle for UMass
Lowell at this point.

50:34.078 --> 50:36.045
Just open them.

50:36.047 --> 50:37.780
[sighs] I can't. You do it.

50:37.782 --> 50:40.420
- Okay.
- Uh, start with this one.

50:42.188 --> 50:43.923
[grunts]
Okay.

50:47.525 --> 50:49.992
Right.
"Mr. Laurie Laurence,

50:49.994 --> 50:52.195
thank you for your application
to Stanford University.

50:52.197 --> 50:56.065
We are pleased to announce your
acceptance for the fall semester."

50:56.067 --> 50:58.469
- I got in?
- Yes! I knew you would.

50:58.471 --> 51:00.540
I can't believe it!

51:01.940 --> 51:03.607
- Yes.
- [laughs]

51:03.609 --> 51:04.942
Let's open the rest.

51:04.944 --> 51:08.078
Oh! Throw 'em away! Burn 'em! I don't care.
I'm going to Stanford!

51:08.080 --> 51:08.982
[screams]

51:10.549 --> 51:12.014
Okay, okay.
Your turn.

51:12.016 --> 51:14.217
[sighs]
You do the honors.

51:14.219 --> 51:15.922
[in posh accent]
With pleasure.

51:20.558 --> 51:25.962
"Miss Josephine March, We thank you for
your interest in the University of Oxford.

51:25.964 --> 51:27.699
It is with regret that..."

51:35.574 --> 51:37.976
Jo, I'm sorry.

51:55.194 --> 51:56.496
[sighs]

52:08.741 --> 52:09.842
[yells]

52:14.013 --> 52:16.616
You've got to get goin'. You're
going to miss orientation.

52:17.882 --> 52:20.052
Stanford waits for no man.
[clears throat]

52:20.886 --> 52:22.819
It's not fair.

52:22.821 --> 52:25.221
- You're so much smarter than me.
- It's fine.

52:25.223 --> 52:29.192
I'm gonna hang out here, write a
few novels and hang out with Beth.

52:29.194 --> 52:30.964
You're gonna be back
before we know it.

52:32.998 --> 52:35.534
- I'll text you when I get there.
- Yeah.

52:39.772 --> 52:41.907
Do all the things

It's so good. You have

53:57.248 --> 54:00.116
Really? You think so?

54:00.118 --> 54:01.086
Yes.

54:01.987 --> 54:05.124
Okay. Was it too much
to kill off Theonia?

54:07.025 --> 54:08.125
No.

54:08.127 --> 54:10.862
All the best stories
have some tragedy.

54:13.398 --> 54:16.233
What if Marek
was actually a girl,

54:16.235 --> 54:19.168
who dresses up as a boy
to make her journey safer,

54:19.170 --> 54:22.338
but then by the third act
she can no longer hide?

54:22.340 --> 54:23.676
Beth.

54:25.043 --> 54:26.812
That is genius!

54:29.415 --> 54:32.282
I think that Clarissa should still
fall in love with the Prince.

54:32.284 --> 54:34.284
It's not a love story!

54:34.286 --> 54:35.755
Isn't everything?

54:37.723 --> 54:39.993
Overall, though,
I loved it.

54:41.460 --> 54:44.728
I don't think I'll ever be as good
at anything as you are at writing.

54:44.730 --> 54:47.766
You're way better
at being a good human.

54:48.701 --> 54:50.203
I can help you
with that.

54:51.436 --> 54:53.335
Oh, and piano.

54:53.337 --> 54:55.739
Mmm.
Can't help you there.

54:55.741 --> 54:56.773
You're pretty much
hopeless.

54:56.775 --> 54:58.911
- [scoffs]
- [giggles]

54:59.478 --> 55:00.780
I just...

55:02.313 --> 55:06.685
I want to write something that
won't be forgotten after I die.

55:08.087 --> 55:09.722
You will.

55:10.288 --> 55:11.723
I know it.

55:17.429 --> 55:20.163
- It's the one.
- What do you mean?

55:20.165 --> 55:22.701
You know. The draft to
send out to publishers?

55:24.502 --> 55:26.503
[grunts]

55:26.505 --> 55:29.809
Jo. I-I don't...

55:31.375 --> 55:33.409
- It's not quite ready.
- How do you know?

55:33.411 --> 55:36.279
You haven't finished it yet.
[scoffs]

55:36.281 --> 55:37.447
I just know.

55:37.449 --> 55:40.817
It's a grueling process.
Listen.

55:40.819 --> 55:44.920
Madeleine L'Engle
racked up 26 rejections

55:44.922 --> 55:46.155
before <i>Wrinkle</i>
was published.

55:46.157 --> 55:48.058
Is that supposed to
make me feel better?

55:48.060 --> 55:49.326
It's supposed to
give you perspective.

55:49.328 --> 55:53.797
Even Freddy Bhaer wrote
an impressive 14 novels

55:53.799 --> 55:54.931
before he was published.

55:54.933 --> 55:57.266
Oh, "Freddy Bhaer."
Wow.

55:57.268 --> 55:59.304
You love throwing your name
in there, right?

56:00.772 --> 56:03.206
[sighs]
Is it any good?

56:03.208 --> 56:05.509
Some say yes.

56:05.511 --> 56:08.313
The <i>New Yorker</i> said "lacks
linguistic vision," so...

56:09.514 --> 56:11.114
You should
read it sometime.

56:11.116 --> 56:12.185
I will.

56:13.418 --> 56:16.018
Right after
you send off my draft.

56:16.020 --> 56:20.292
Maybe... Maybe it's time to
take a break from this one.

56:21.826 --> 56:23.058
Work on something new.

56:23.060 --> 56:24.994
Something new?

56:24.996 --> 56:26.962
I've been working on this
for ten years.

56:26.964 --> 56:28.799
That's exactly
why it might be helpful

56:28.801 --> 56:30.866
to try working on something
else for a change.

56:30.868 --> 56:32.201
So you're not going to help me?

56:32.203 --> 56:33.869
What do you think
I've been doing?

56:33.871 --> 56:36.172
I don't know, actually.

56:36.174 --> 56:39.208
Why do you spend so much time with
me if you don't think I can do it?

56:39.210 --> 56:41.545
I didn't say that, and I thought
we liked spending time together.

56:41.547 --> 56:43.282
That's beside the point!

56:44.282 --> 56:45.982
Is it?

56:45.984 --> 56:48.154
- [phone vibrates]
- Josephine.

56:49.888 --> 56:52.087
- I have to go.
- We need to talk about this.

56:52.089 --> 56:54.226
I don't want to talk about it.

56:56.828 --> 56:58.161
[door slams]

56:58.163 --> 56:59.232
[sighs]

57:01.266 --> 57:04.433
Marmee, I just want to say
before you say anything...

57:04.435 --> 57:05.904
<i>Listen to me.
It's back.</i>

57:06.971 --> 57:08.137
[Jo]
You have to eat it!

57:08.139 --> 57:09.471
[Amy] I don't wanna eat it.
It's so gross!

57:09.473 --> 57:11.474
[Jo]
You asked for a dare!

57:11.476 --> 57:12.976
Don't eat it
if you don't want to.

57:12.978 --> 57:14.076
What the heck,
you guys?

57:14.078 --> 57:16.246
- Come back.
- Oh, my God!

57:16.248 --> 57:17.114
Let it go.

57:17.116 --> 57:20.150
Whatever! I heard
you the first time!

57:20.152 --> 57:22.085
Okay, okay.
We're going on.

57:22.087 --> 57:25.387
It's my turn.
It's my turn. Okay.

57:25.389 --> 57:27.456
Laurie, truth or dare.

57:27.458 --> 57:28.958
- Truth.
- Coward.

57:28.960 --> 57:31.862
Who do you think
is the prettiest girl here?

57:31.864 --> 57:33.864
Oh, you are lame.

57:33.866 --> 57:36.099
Easy. Meg.
No question.

57:36.101 --> 57:40.637
Now, Brooke, um, what's your
thoughts on the matter? Hmm?

57:40.639 --> 57:43.172
You know, I only see inner beauty.
So...

57:43.174 --> 57:45.942
Oh! Okay. All right.
That's enough.

57:45.944 --> 57:47.543
- [retches]
- Look, she's pretty.

57:47.545 --> 57:49.246
Inside and out.
We all get it.

57:49.248 --> 57:51.882
- This is stupid. Let's play Extreme Sardine.
- Yeah!

57:51.884 --> 57:57.186
I say the last person to find me has
to lick every one of our big toes.

57:57.188 --> 57:58.255
Oh!

57:58.257 --> 58:00.357
One, two,

58:00.359 --> 58:03.960

three, four, five,

58:03.962 --> 58:08.398
six, seven, eight, nine,

[both] ten.

58:11.235 --> 58:12.237
Oh.

58:17.375 --> 58:18.910
I see you!

58:32.523 --> 58:33.993
Jo?

[taps piano keys]

58:58.382 --> 59:01.052
[begins playing piano]

59:23.407 --> 59:26.076

- I'm so sorry. The...

59:26.078 --> 59:29.378
You come in here,
you play my favorite piece,

59:29.380 --> 59:32.051
and you don't have
the decency to finish it?

59:33.150 --> 59:34.183
Hmm?

59:34.185 --> 59:35.719
Go.

59:35.721 --> 59:37.420
I-I'm sorry.

59:37.422 --> 59:39.755
As well you should be.

59:39.757 --> 59:43.726
And I think that you should come
over here three days a week

59:43.728 --> 59:45.964
and play whatever you like.

59:47.699 --> 59:49.502
Do we have a deal?

59:50.402 --> 59:52.168
Well, then I...

59:52.170 --> 59:55.975
I think this calls for a
little Beethoven, don't you?

01:00:12.056 --> 01:00:13.993
[continues playing]

01:01:17.322 --> 01:01:19.558
[doctor]
Chronic myelogenous leukemia.

01:01:20.759 --> 01:01:23.159
Leukemia?

01:01:23.161 --> 01:01:25.063
She's young, so there's
a lot we can do.

01:01:27.299 --> 01:01:29.435
- [whispers] Cancer?
- It's a type of cancer.

01:01:30.402 --> 01:01:33.503
[Marmee] So, okay.
What can we do?

01:01:33.505 --> 01:01:37.474
We want to start with radiation
and chemotherapy immediately.

01:01:37.476 --> 01:01:41.543
It will be very hard on her.
She's already quite frail.

01:01:41.545 --> 01:01:45.215
- But she seems like a fighter.
- Do not call her frail!

01:01:45.217 --> 01:01:46.683
You don't even know her!

01:01:46.685 --> 01:01:48.550
Josephine.
Josephine.

01:01:48.552 --> 01:01:51.257
Meg, honey, will you
go get her please? Go.

01:01:52.857 --> 01:01:55.427
- I'm really sorry.
- It's a lot.

01:01:56.761 --> 01:01:58.197
Uhh!

01:02:01.366 --> 01:02:02.435
[yells]

01:02:09.141 --> 01:02:10.476
I'm sorry.

01:02:14.645 --> 01:02:17.582
[monitor beeping]

01:02:33.931 --> 01:02:35.498
[sighs]

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.136
It's gonna be okay.

01:02:38.770 --> 01:02:41.503
What if I get sick too?

01:02:41.505 --> 01:02:45.507
What if I die before
I get to do anything?

01:02:45.509 --> 01:02:50.679
I've never been in love.
I've never had a boyfriend.

01:02:50.681 --> 01:02:52.250
Never even been kissed.

01:02:54.252 --> 01:02:58.257
Hey. You're gonna be okay.

01:03:00.424 --> 01:03:04.194
I promise. You're not gonna
die without being kissed.

01:03:04.196 --> 01:03:05.929
How do you know?

01:03:05.931 --> 01:03:07.465
I just know.

01:03:08.433 --> 01:03:10.400
Even if I have to
do it myself,

01:03:10.402 --> 01:03:11.800
I'm gonna make it happen.

01:03:11.802 --> 01:03:13.936
[chuckling]

01:03:13.938 --> 01:03:15.406
Fine.

01:03:21.813 --> 01:03:24.913
Excuse me, sir, you can't go
past here without signing in.

01:03:24.915 --> 01:03:27.683
I'm not a <i>sir,</i> sir.

01:03:27.685 --> 01:03:31.520
Check your clipboard. Name's Jo March.
I'm already signed in.

01:03:31.522 --> 01:03:34.626
[sighs] You're tired, honey.
I'm sorry.

01:03:36.328 --> 01:03:38.697
- You're looking better though.
- Thanks.

01:03:40.364 --> 01:03:42.599
- Where have you been?
- I was so worried about you.

01:03:42.601 --> 01:03:45.969
Beth, do not worry about me. I'm fine.
I-I'm sorry. I freaked out.

01:03:45.971 --> 01:03:50.572
I know. I-I felt so helpless,
and so I had to do something.

01:03:50.574 --> 01:03:53.275
So I started on the Internet,
didn't know what to do.

01:03:53.277 --> 01:03:56.913
Horrible idea. WebMD
scared the crap out of me.

01:03:56.915 --> 01:04:00.916
And then I started Googling
all these cures and treatments

01:04:00.918 --> 01:04:04.723
and three hours in, I realized
that's not what you need.

01:04:06.023 --> 01:04:11.628
Beth, I know
you're gonna fight this.

01:04:11.630 --> 01:04:13.532
And I know
you're gonna beat it.

01:04:14.266 --> 01:04:15.998
You have to.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.237
So, one thing
that I promise...

01:04:20.471 --> 01:04:24.607
that I'm going to be by your
side for every bit of it.

01:04:24.609 --> 01:04:28.444
So if you have to go on a special
diet of spinach juice and tree bark,

01:04:28.446 --> 01:04:30.380
- I will eat it with you.
- [giggling]

01:04:30.382 --> 01:04:32.614
If you have to bathe
in essential oils twice a day,

01:04:32.616 --> 01:04:36.386
I will join that pyramid scheme,
and I will get you those oils.

01:04:36.388 --> 01:04:40.759
If you're gonna lose
that gorgeous hair...

01:04:44.895 --> 01:04:46.631
well, soldier...

01:04:51.969 --> 01:04:53.503
[gasps]

01:04:53.505 --> 01:04:55.840
I'm losing it with you.

01:04:56.907 --> 01:04:58.444
Wow!

01:04:59.444 --> 01:05:02.011
That's really bald.

01:05:02.013 --> 01:05:03.445
[trembling]

01:05:03.447 --> 01:05:06.516
God, it feels like
the head of an alien.

01:05:06.518 --> 01:05:08.650
[Marmee] What did you do with your hair?
Did you donate it?

01:05:08.652 --> 01:05:11.688
No, Mom. I sold it to pay
for that stupid candy machine.

01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:13.389
Yeah, they've got a good
selection down there.

01:05:13.391 --> 01:05:15.491
- [screams]
- Gosh!

01:05:15.493 --> 01:05:16.826
Jo!

01:05:16.828 --> 01:05:18.895
How did you... Why?

01:05:18.897 --> 01:05:21.299
Your one beauty.

01:05:26.670 --> 01:05:30.609
Honey, cheer up. She's
gonna be all right.

01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:35.078
[Jo] I shouldn't be this upset.

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:40.416
[Marmee] We all are, honey.
Come on, Jo.

01:05:40.418 --> 01:05:41.753
It's natural.

01:05:44.989 --> 01:05:47.857
It's okay to be upset. I know
she means the world to you.

01:05:47.859 --> 01:05:51.694
No, it's... I never
realized how ugly I am.

01:05:51.696 --> 01:05:54.130
Oh, honey,
your hair will grow back.

01:05:54.132 --> 01:05:56.632
Not for forever.

01:05:56.634 --> 01:05:59.000
Trust me, when you
look back at this time,

01:05:59.002 --> 01:06:00.672
you're not gonna care
how you looked.

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:06.679
Besides. What's the most important
is the workings of your mind.

01:06:07.444 --> 01:06:10.348
Your humor, your kindness.

01:06:10.982 --> 01:06:12.518
Your courage.

01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:19.457
Don't tell Bethy, okay?

01:06:20.692 --> 01:06:22.525
Of course not.

01:06:22.527 --> 01:06:24.897
She's lucky to have you.

01:06:25.996 --> 01:06:28.466
- Are you all ready?
- Yeah.

01:06:29.768 --> 01:06:30.866
Oh, they're coming.

Why do you even want
to get married?

01:09:08.825 --> 01:09:12.627
We don't live in the 1700s. We
don't have to rely on men anymore.

01:09:12.629 --> 01:09:15.095
- Because I love him.
- Oh, how do you even know?

01:09:15.098 --> 01:09:18.634
Look, I just know. And I
really need you to support me.

01:09:18.636 --> 01:09:19.705
Well, I can't.

01:09:20.804 --> 01:09:22.171
I know you don't understand

01:09:22.173 --> 01:09:25.274
why I wanna be a mom and
get married and have kids,

01:09:25.276 --> 01:09:26.609
but it's what I want.

01:09:26.611 --> 01:09:28.609
I don't believe you.

It's not your castle.
It's mine.

01:09:31.316 --> 01:09:33.314
Meg, just remember this.

01:09:33.317 --> 01:09:37.051
One day when you're 40 years
old, you're gonna wake up

01:09:37.054 --> 01:09:40.055
and you're gonna look at
your wrinkly face in the mirror,

01:09:40.057 --> 01:09:45.760
and you're gonna ask yourself,
"What did I do with my life,

01:09:45.761 --> 01:09:49.799
except give up everything
for a man?"

01:09:49.801 --> 01:09:55.203
How dare you belittle
my life and my dreams?

01:09:55.205 --> 01:09:58.640
I have always been there for you with
your work and all of your ambitions,

01:09:58.642 --> 01:10:01.042
no matter how insane
they seemed to me.

01:10:01.044 --> 01:10:04.980
I'm not asking you to change,
all I'm asking... Jo!

01:10:04.982 --> 01:10:06.782
[sighs]

01:10:06.784 --> 01:10:10.920
All I'm asking is that you
be by my side for one day

01:10:10.922 --> 01:10:14.959
to support me in the life I have
chosen to live, without judgment.

01:10:15.994 --> 01:10:17.963
You seriously can't
give me that?

01:10:20.731 --> 01:10:22.833
How selfish are you?

01:10:39.917 --> 01:10:44.119
Dove's right.
We're growing up.

01:10:44.121 --> 01:10:45.320
You have to deal with that.

01:10:45.322 --> 01:10:49.257
So, I'm just supposed to sit
around, let her ruin her life?

01:10:49.259 --> 01:10:53.931
Well, that's the point.
It's her life, it's not yours.

01:10:57.401 --> 01:11:00.202
She's going to regret this.

01:11:00.204 --> 01:11:02.941
If you don't go to this wedding,
you will regret it.

Cheers to a piece of paper.

01:12:48.379 --> 01:12:51.113
- So, what's next?
- I don't know.

01:12:51.115 --> 01:12:54.949
Part of me wants to just chill
out and work on my music,

01:12:54.951 --> 01:12:58.988
but there's so much pressure
to go out and get a real job.

01:12:58.990 --> 01:13:01.290
Grandpa wants me to move
to London

01:13:01.292 --> 01:13:04.960
and learn the exciting world
of bond trading.

01:13:04.962 --> 01:13:08.329
No, that is awesome.
You have to do it.

01:13:08.331 --> 01:13:09.931
But what about my music?

01:13:09.933 --> 01:13:12.568
Do both. It's London.

01:13:12.570 --> 01:13:15.907
Come on.
You can't pass it up.

01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:21.877
- Come with me.
- [scoffs] Okay.

01:13:21.879 --> 01:13:24.913
You know I want to, but I can't.
Not yet anyway.

01:13:24.915 --> 01:13:28.917
Why not? You've always said you
wanted to get out of here, so do it.

01:13:28.919 --> 01:13:32.289
I have classes at Lowell.

01:13:34.191 --> 01:13:37.128
I-I cannot be
that far from Beth.

01:13:41.164 --> 01:13:43.998
What if we both go
to New York instead?

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.905
- You hate New York.
- So what?

01:13:47.838 --> 01:13:49.305
It's closer to the family.

01:13:49.307 --> 01:13:51.172
Then we could be together.

01:13:51.174 --> 01:13:52.474
No.

01:13:52.476 --> 01:13:55.243
No. You need to go
to Europe.

01:13:55.245 --> 01:13:58.948
- Do not change your plans for me.
- But I want to be with you.

01:13:58.950 --> 01:14:03.018
I will come visit you
whenever I can.

01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:07.057
Jo, listen to me.
I want to be with you.

01:14:10.294 --> 01:14:11.263
What?

01:14:12.597 --> 01:14:14.833
I love you, Jo March.

01:14:16.334 --> 01:14:17.369
Whoa! Wha...

01:14:19.203 --> 01:14:21.871
Okay, okay. Don't be stubborn
because I know you love me too.

01:14:21.873 --> 01:14:23.375
- I do, but...
- But what?

01:14:24.609 --> 01:14:27.009
- You're like my brother.
- But I'm not.

01:14:27.011 --> 01:14:30.112
- But I don't love you like that.
- Yes, you do.

01:14:30.114 --> 01:14:32.247
Jo, I'm your favorite person
in this whole world.

01:14:32.249 --> 01:14:36.051
Yeah, you-you are,
but it's... it's...

01:14:36.053 --> 01:14:39.188
No, what we have is... It
is not that kind of love.

01:14:39.190 --> 01:14:42.323
- It's...
- Because you won't...

01:14:42.325 --> 01:14:47.429
It's not you, Laurie. It's just I don't
know if that's what I want, Laurie.

01:14:47.431 --> 01:14:48.963
- Yes, you do.
- With anyone ever!

01:14:48.965 --> 01:14:51.433
- No, I don't!
- Yes, you will! One day you will!

01:14:51.435 --> 01:14:53.237
You're gonna find someone...

01:14:54.371 --> 01:14:58.109
that's gonna make it impossible
for you to say no.

01:15:01.445 --> 01:15:03.979
It's just not gonna be me.

01:15:03.981 --> 01:15:07.052
Laurie, it's... Laurie!

01:15:12.455 --> 01:15:14.426
Laurie!

01:15:19.629 --> 01:15:21.529
<i>Hey, Freddy, it's Jo.</i>

01:15:21.531 --> 01:15:25.266
<i>I had some family stuff come up, so
I'm gonna be going home for a while.</i>

01:15:25.268 --> 01:15:28.269
<i>Hopefully, I'll see you
after the holidays.</i>

01:15:28.271 --> 01:15:30.405
[Meg] It seems like
we're missing something.

01:15:30.407 --> 01:15:32.140
[Brooke] That's not it.

01:15:32.142 --> 01:15:34.310
- No, the other one.
- Which one?

01:15:34.312 --> 01:15:36.010
Yeah.

01:15:36.012 --> 01:15:38.546
Wow. It looks so great.

01:15:38.548 --> 01:15:41.283
- I think we're good, right?
- No. No, not yet, honey.

01:15:41.285 --> 01:15:45.023
Could you find a home
for this?

01:15:47.290 --> 01:15:48.556
[clears throat]

01:15:48.558 --> 01:15:50.326
[both] Jo!

01:15:50.328 --> 01:15:51.993
Hi!

01:15:51.995 --> 01:15:53.295
Are you kidding me?

01:15:53.297 --> 01:15:55.197
- [laughing]
- And it's twins. So...

01:15:55.199 --> 01:15:58.967
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I wanted to surprise you.

01:15:58.969 --> 01:16:02.171
Oh, please! You wanted
to see my reaction.

01:16:02.173 --> 01:16:03.572
Oh.

01:16:03.574 --> 01:16:05.207
It was entertaining.

01:16:05.209 --> 01:16:09.281
- Oh, Marmee.
- Welcome home, Jo! Welcome home, baby.

01:16:10.614 --> 01:16:13.748
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:15.387
Where is she?

01:16:18.188 --> 01:16:21.357
- What you been up to?
- You know me.

01:16:21.359 --> 01:16:24.525
Out every night,
hittin' the club.

01:16:24.527 --> 01:16:27.729
[beatboxing]

01:16:27.731 --> 01:16:29.967
[both laugh]

01:16:31.569 --> 01:16:33.702
I've missed you.

01:16:33.704 --> 01:16:38.340
I mean, I don't miss waking up at 3:00 a.m.
every morning to:

01:16:38.342 --> 01:16:43.214
"Beth. Beth, do you think
Lithgo is a good pirate name?"

01:16:44.714 --> 01:16:46.217
It's not.

01:16:49.352 --> 01:16:51.522
I'm sorry I haven't
visited in a while.

01:16:53.023 --> 01:16:55.090
That's okay.

01:16:55.092 --> 01:17:00.331
You're out making your mark
in <i>New York City.</i>

01:17:01.365 --> 01:17:03.465
So proud of you.

01:17:03.467 --> 01:17:06.301
Waking up every morning
in a city full of...

01:17:06.303 --> 01:17:07.472
I hate it.

01:17:09.106 --> 01:17:11.573
- I thought you loved it.
- No.

01:17:11.575 --> 01:17:14.275
Well, it's New York.
Everybody says they love it.

01:17:14.277 --> 01:17:17.115
You have to,
but nobody really does.

01:17:19.049 --> 01:17:23.652
I thought I would feel inspired, but
instead of bringing out my creativity,

01:17:23.654 --> 01:17:27.189
- it brings out my anger issues.
- Uh-oh.

01:17:27.191 --> 01:17:31.225
Sometimes when I'm
walking up the subway steps,

01:17:31.227 --> 01:17:34.128
and people are shoving
and on their phones,

01:17:34.130 --> 01:17:36.665
I just want to grab them
by the shoulders and scream,

01:17:36.667 --> 01:17:43.771
"Do you know there is a big,
spacious green world out there?"

01:17:43.773 --> 01:17:45.343
You don't though, right?

01:17:46.643 --> 01:17:53.051
One time, to a really nice
Chinese man named Han.

01:17:54.451 --> 01:17:57.752
And, apparently, everybody's
dream is to be a writer.

01:17:57.754 --> 01:18:01.857
Except Han. He's a fishmonger,
and he's doing great.

01:18:01.859 --> 01:18:03.428
I just...

01:18:05.161 --> 01:18:07.197
don't think I can compete.

01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:11.233
You're the best writer
I know.

01:18:11.235 --> 01:18:15.703
Well, no offense,
but you don't get out much.

01:18:15.705 --> 01:18:18.306
[both laugh]

01:18:18.308 --> 01:18:21.710
[Jo] Still think there's some
pretty juicy secrets in here.

01:18:21.712 --> 01:18:24.212
Don't even think
about it.

01:18:24.214 --> 01:18:27.582
I'm pretty sure we've
outgrown the club rules.

01:18:27.584 --> 01:18:31.487
- Maybe you old hags have.
- [gasps] Amy! You made it!

01:18:31.489 --> 01:18:33.454
Ooh.

01:18:33.456 --> 01:18:37.126
You seriously look like this
after an international flight?

01:18:37.128 --> 01:18:39.130
It was the longest flight
of my life.

01:18:40.530 --> 01:18:41.762
[laughs]

01:18:41.764 --> 01:18:43.200
- [Beth] Amy.
- Beth!

01:18:47.471 --> 01:18:50.538
- I missed you.
- I missed you more.

01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:55.610
Mm! Whoa! We do not fit
on this like we used to.

01:18:55.612 --> 01:18:58.479
Amy, I want to hear
all about Oxford.

01:18:58.481 --> 01:19:01.350
One semester left, and already
two different galleries

01:19:01.352 --> 01:19:03.351
wanna buy my Haslemere
landscape series.

01:19:03.353 --> 01:19:04.786
What about the
"Watching Deer Triptych"?

01:19:04.788 --> 01:19:06.921
- Oh, that's my favorite!
- The what?

01:19:06.923 --> 01:19:09.224
So, last week, I met
with the Lisson Gallery,

01:19:09.226 --> 01:19:13.228
- and they seem interested.
- That's so exciting!

01:19:13.230 --> 01:19:17.466
Wait, what? The what gallery? Why do I
not know what you're talking about?

01:19:17.468 --> 01:19:19.734
If you answered your phone,
you would know.

01:19:19.736 --> 01:19:21.636
Wait. Who dug this out?

01:19:21.638 --> 01:19:23.305
Oh...

01:19:23.307 --> 01:19:26.377
I always want to read through
it when I'm here alone.

01:19:29.746 --> 01:19:31.345
Oh, my gosh.

01:19:31.347 --> 01:19:32.382
What?

01:19:32.917 --> 01:19:34.384
Okay.

01:19:35.486 --> 01:19:37.952
I think it's time
to share this one.

01:19:37.954 --> 01:19:42.558
<i>♪ I'm not afraid

01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:45.394
So, I guess now I know why you
joined the home-schooled crew.

01:19:45.396 --> 01:19:48.396
Yep. And now you know why I
used to clip little pug nose.

01:19:48.398 --> 01:19:50.498
I miss your
little pug nose.

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:53.737
- <i>♪ As they made ♪</i>
- [no audible dialogue]

01:19:56.373 --> 01:19:58.774
- <i>♪ In your heart ♪</i>
- I had such a crush on him.

01:19:58.776 --> 01:20:00.841
You had a crush
on everybody.

01:20:00.843 --> 01:20:02.277
Hey!

01:20:02.279 --> 01:20:04.579
[Meg] <i>Prom.

Oh, he still hates

01:20:27.404 --> 01:20:30.439
Then I will continue
to do so.

01:20:30.441 --> 01:20:32.774
I'm just glad
you speak to him at all.

01:20:32.776 --> 01:20:36.345
I think it should be illegal for
anybody under 30 to get married.

01:20:36.347 --> 01:20:39.848
Well, you're almost there,
so... any prospects?

01:20:39.850 --> 01:20:42.783
No. Not you too?

01:20:42.785 --> 01:20:47.256
I'm just curious. And
vicariously living through you.

01:20:47.258 --> 01:20:49.591
Hey, Jo. Do you mind
helping me with dinner?

01:20:49.593 --> 01:20:53.327
Oh, sorry. We're working
on our "Heart and Soul" duet.

01:20:53.329 --> 01:20:55.497
Really gonna wow
everyone this year.

01:20:55.499 --> 01:20:58.567
- Just come help me, please.
- Put me on trash duty.

01:20:58.569 --> 01:21:00.405
Jo, please.

01:21:02.673 --> 01:21:04.739
[Jo] I thought you
needed my help.

01:21:04.741 --> 01:21:07.376
[Amy] I just said that because I
wanted to be alone for a minute.

01:21:07.378 --> 01:21:09.543
Is everything okay?

01:21:09.545 --> 01:21:11.579
Yeah. I just wanted to catch up.

01:21:11.581 --> 01:21:13.748
There's so much
going on in both our lives

01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:16.551
that I don't even know what we
don't know about each other.

01:21:16.553 --> 01:21:18.723
- You know what I mean?
- Not really.

01:21:20.023 --> 01:21:21.491

01:21:23.893 --> 01:21:25.629
Okay, um...

01:21:27.063 --> 01:21:30.931
I wanted to tell you
about me and...

01:21:30.933 --> 01:21:32.967
[Meg] Laurie, you made it!

01:21:32.969 --> 01:21:34.638
Laurie?

01:21:36.039 --> 01:21:37.973
- It's so good to see you.
- You too.

01:21:37.975 --> 01:21:39.440
Laurie.

01:21:39.442 --> 01:21:40.775

01:21:44.615 --> 01:21:46.681
Laurie, I thought you
couldn't come till later.

01:21:46.683 --> 01:21:50.051
I caught an earlier flight.
I wanted to surprise you guys.

01:21:50.053 --> 01:21:51.853
Well, we are
definitely surprised.

01:21:51.855 --> 01:21:55.857
I am so glad you're here.
Now it feels like Christmas.

01:21:55.859 --> 01:21:57.359
- Hey, Laurie.
- Oh, my Bethy.

01:21:57.361 --> 01:21:59.427
- Mmm.
- How are you?

01:21:59.429 --> 01:22:03.064
You know me. Just happy
that everyone's home.

01:22:03.066 --> 01:22:05.100
I missed my platoon.

01:22:05.102 --> 01:22:09.837
Okay. What's new? I have not
talked to you in, like, forever!

01:22:09.839 --> 01:22:13.841
You mean the last four e-mails that I
sent you that you didn't write back?

01:22:13.843 --> 01:22:16.845
You know I'm better in person.

01:22:16.847 --> 01:22:20.948
Come on. Tell me everything.
Spare me no details. None.

01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:22.486
You first.

01:22:27.825 --> 01:22:30.762
[no audible dialogue]

01:22:53.584 --> 01:22:55.417
You know you're gonna
be a grandpa soon.

01:22:55.419 --> 01:22:57.452
- If it's a girl...
- Grandpa? No.

01:22:57.454 --> 01:22:59.787
[Marmee] We're gonna be
grandparents, guys!

01:22:59.789 --> 01:23:03.625
- I'm not ready for that. I'm not ready for Grandpa.
- Twice as good.

01:23:03.627 --> 01:23:06.127
I wanna hear about the business.
How's the...

01:23:06.129 --> 01:23:07.528
You know, business is good.

01:23:07.530 --> 01:23:09.064
[Jo]
He's lying!

01:23:09.066 --> 01:23:12.400
He's a working man now. It's
respectable to be a working man.

01:23:12.402 --> 01:23:15.103
I... I, uh, I can't complain.

01:23:15.105 --> 01:23:16.904
[Meg] Are you
still doing your music?

01:23:16.906 --> 01:23:18.473
You know, I can't complain.

01:23:18.475 --> 01:23:21.409
- [everyone laughs]
- Gotcha. Gotcha.

01:23:21.411 --> 01:23:22.778
You okay?

01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:25.646
Oops. Merry Christmas,
my pretties.

01:23:25.648 --> 01:23:27.482
- [all yelling]
- Aunt March!

01:23:27.484 --> 01:23:29.518
- Hey!
- [Jo] What are you doing here?

01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:30.818
What a surprise.

01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:32.921
What happened to
your seniors cruise?

01:23:32.923 --> 01:23:34.922
Well, I don't know.

01:23:34.924 --> 01:23:38.693
I suppose the Danube has lost
its luster in my old age.

01:23:38.695 --> 01:23:42.764
Aunt March, I think
that you're the only person

01:23:42.766 --> 01:23:45.634
in the history of time that's
ever gotten bored with Europe.

01:23:45.636 --> 01:23:48.702
- Besides Marco Polo.
- And Christopher Columbus.

01:23:48.704 --> 01:23:51.006
- Countless immigrants also.
- Mm-hmm.

01:23:51.008 --> 01:23:52.640
- The Vikings.
- The Beatles.

01:23:52.642 --> 01:23:54.643
- One Direction.
- Tons of people, really.

01:23:54.645 --> 01:23:57.112
Yeah, I get it.
Okay, got it. Ha ha!

01:23:57.114 --> 01:23:58.680
Josephine,
this is for you.

01:23:58.682 --> 01:23:59.848
You shouldn't have.
What?

01:23:59.850 --> 01:24:02.516
I didn't. I found it
on your doorstep.

01:24:02.518 --> 01:24:04.552
- Oh.
- Nearly tripped over it

01:24:04.554 --> 01:24:06.220
when I went to pick up
your mail.

01:24:06.222 --> 01:24:08.523
Can't say "Grandpa."
Somethin' else.

01:24:08.525 --> 01:24:11.827
Pappy, pappy.
Poppy, Pop-pop.

01:24:11.829 --> 01:24:12.864
Look at that.

01:24:19.937 --> 01:24:21.101
[Marmee]
Who's it from?

01:24:21.103 --> 01:24:23.204
Ooh. Who's Freddy?

01:24:23.206 --> 01:24:25.172
Are you 12?

01:24:25.174 --> 01:24:27.074
[Meg]
What does the note say?

01:24:27.076 --> 01:24:29.944
It said,
"When life is rough..."

01:24:29.946 --> 01:24:32.213
That's all I got to
before she slammed it shut.

01:24:32.215 --> 01:24:34.515
[Papa March] All right, take it easy.
She's not gonna tell you.

01:24:34.517 --> 01:24:35.917
You little cheat!

01:24:35.919 --> 01:24:38.019
She'll tell me. Right?

01:24:38.021 --> 01:24:39.554
- Yeah.
- Don't even try it.

01:24:39.556 --> 01:24:40.921
- I'm not telling you.
- Come on.

01:24:40.923 --> 01:24:42.556
- No.
- Jo, you always...

01:24:42.558 --> 01:24:45.793
- I'm not telling anyone!
- You always tell your dad.

01:24:45.795 --> 01:24:48.997
It's literally nothing.
There's nothing to tell!

01:24:48.999 --> 01:24:51.936
- It's seriously nothing.
- Leave her alone.

01:24:53.136 --> 01:24:56.070
It's probably from that
professor she's been seeing.

01:24:56.072 --> 01:24:57.605
- Oh.
- [together] What?

01:24:57.607 --> 01:24:59.573
- Professor?
- [Papa March] How old is this professor?

01:24:59.575 --> 01:25:02.743
No, no, no, no.

01:25:02.745 --> 01:25:06.915
We are not seeing each other.
He is a professor at Columbia

01:25:06.917 --> 01:25:10.252
who is interested in my writing.
That's is all.

01:25:10.254 --> 01:25:12.253
Jo, that's so exciting.

01:25:12.255 --> 01:25:15.155
Is he also interested
in you?

01:25:15.157 --> 01:25:17.725
No. It's strictly professional.

01:25:17.727 --> 01:25:21.195
- Then why would he send you a package on Christmas Eve?
- That's a good point.

01:25:21.197 --> 01:25:23.532
Because it's Christmas,

01:25:23.534 --> 01:25:25.600
and you give people presents
on Christmas.

01:25:25.602 --> 01:25:27.801
He sent me a Christmas present!

01:25:27.803 --> 01:25:31.605
Why is that so hard to understand?
Is that okay with everybody?

01:25:31.607 --> 01:25:33.274
That's very okay.
That is totally fine.

01:25:33.276 --> 01:25:35.543
Come on.
No, I don't think so.

01:25:35.545 --> 01:25:39.146
You're children.
All of you.

01:25:39.148 --> 01:25:41.882
Especially Dad.
All of you!

01:25:41.884 --> 01:25:44.786
No. That's great that he likes your
writing. He's a very smart man.

01:25:44.788 --> 01:25:48.023
I wouldn't say that he likes it.

01:25:48.025 --> 01:25:52.060
Every time I send him a draft, he sends
me pages and pages and pages of notes.

01:25:52.062 --> 01:25:56.634
But I guess no matter how many drafts
I send, he still reads them, so...

01:25:57.968 --> 01:25:59.935
Well, then he definitely
has a crush on you.

01:25:59.937 --> 01:26:02.770
All right.
All right, I'm done. Out!

01:26:02.772 --> 01:26:06.875
Hey, Jo.
You get back in that seat.

01:26:06.877 --> 01:26:10.882
- Move, move!
- Sit down. We're just teasing you.

01:26:12.648 --> 01:26:13.881
We're just interested
in your life.

01:26:13.883 --> 01:26:16.650
Then stop trying
to freak me out.

01:26:16.652 --> 01:26:17.851
[Papa March] All right, Joe.

01:26:17.853 --> 01:26:19.988
Maybe you're just
overthinking this a bit.

01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:22.256
Not every guy
has alterior motives.

01:26:22.258 --> 01:26:25.092
"Ulterior."
"Ul" with a "U." It...

01:26:25.094 --> 01:26:27.761
- You know what I meant.
- If you're gonna make a point, use the right word.

01:26:27.763 --> 01:26:30.534
Laurie always read your stuff.
He was always just a friend.

01:26:33.736 --> 01:26:38.340
Yeah. Maybe he's just a normal guy who just
so happens to be into mythopoeic fables.

01:26:38.342 --> 01:26:40.274
- Yeah.
- [Laurie] You know?

01:26:40.276 --> 01:26:43.043
Yes.

01:26:43.045 --> 01:26:47.616
A toast. To Jo's novel,
and its inevitable success.

01:26:47.618 --> 01:26:49.184
- Cheers.
- Cheers to Jo.

01:26:49.186 --> 01:26:51.286
[all] Cheers.

01:26:51.288 --> 01:26:56.157
And to Freddy. May his intentions be
pure and his heart not be broken.

01:26:56.159 --> 01:26:58.926
I am not cheersing to that.

01:26:58.928 --> 01:27:02.697
No! I am not... I am
not cheersing to that!

01:27:02.699 --> 01:27:05.100
I am not cheersing!
Stop! I'm not!

01:27:05.102 --> 01:27:06.704
[Jo] No!

01:27:09.106 --> 01:27:10.404
Cheers.

01:27:10.406 --> 01:27:12.075
[Laurie] That was a
good one, Marmee.

Amy, are you okay?

01:28:15.438 --> 01:28:17.439
Yeah.
I'm such a klutz.

01:28:17.441 --> 01:28:20.111
- Oh, my... You're bleeding.
- I know.

01:28:29.486 --> 01:28:33.657
[Amy] Jo! Come back!
Please just talk to me!

01:28:34.725 --> 01:28:36.160
Let me explain.

01:28:38.294 --> 01:28:42.796
He's been in London. So, of course
we've been seeing a lot of each other.

01:28:42.798 --> 01:28:45.466
At first,
it was just as friends,

01:28:45.468 --> 01:28:48.470
but then at some point,
it changed.

01:28:48.472 --> 01:28:50.007
So, what?
You're dating now?

01:28:51.074 --> 01:28:54.042
I know this must be
so weird for you.

01:28:54.044 --> 01:28:56.147
At first it was weird
for me too...

01:28:57.981 --> 01:28:59.850
but please
don't be mad at me.

01:29:02.119 --> 01:29:03.254
Do you love him?

01:29:04.187 --> 01:29:05.890
I think I always have.

01:29:07.356 --> 01:29:08.892
And how does he feel?

01:29:09.459 --> 01:29:11.792
The same.

01:29:11.794 --> 01:29:14.065
At least that's what
he tells me.

01:29:19.369 --> 01:29:22.237
Then, I'm happy for you.

01:29:22.239 --> 01:29:23.438
You are?

01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:25.076
Of course.

01:29:30.213 --> 01:29:33.148
That stinkin' Laurie.

01:29:33.150 --> 01:29:37.818
He has been trying to weasel his way
into this family since day one.

I think they were nervous
about how you would react.

have to choose him?

Yeah, but I didn't want anyone
else to have him either.

01:30:48.859 --> 01:30:50.361

[Jo] The beach is so wonderfully

- Beth.

- Stop it.

01:33:03.192 --> 01:33:05.428
- And I've come to terms with it.
- Don't...

01:33:09.098 --> 01:33:11.067

everything can be taken away from you?

01:41:59.128 --> 01:42:00.464
[sighs]

01:42:03.132 --> 01:42:05.265
[giggling]

01:42:05.267 --> 01:42:07.835
You happy? Yeah.

01:42:07.837 --> 01:42:10.170
- [crying]
- Oh.

01:42:10.172 --> 01:42:13.974
- I have no idea what to do with them yet.
- [chuckling]

01:42:13.976 --> 01:42:17.610
But I think once they
become actual humans,

01:42:17.612 --> 01:42:19.145
I'm gonna be
their favorite aunt.

01:42:19.147 --> 01:42:22.082
- I'm sure you will be.
- [knocking]

01:42:22.084 --> 01:42:24.952
Could you get it?
It might be their playdate.

01:42:24.954 --> 01:42:28.087
Playdate? They...
They hardly move.

01:42:28.089 --> 01:42:30.060
Just get the door.
Come here.

01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:32.893
There we go.
Oh, hi.

01:42:32.895 --> 01:42:36.296
Hi, there. Oh, my.

01:42:36.298 --> 01:42:37.900
Who could be at the door?

01:42:41.236 --> 01:42:42.538
Freddy.

01:42:43.172 --> 01:42:45.072
What are you doing here?

01:42:45.074 --> 01:42:46.843
I read your book.

01:42:48.244 --> 01:42:50.743
A few times... actually.

01:42:50.745 --> 01:42:55.783
Did you take a six-hour train
ride just to tell me that?

01:42:55.785 --> 01:42:58.121
I needed to see something.

01:43:05.794 --> 01:43:08.097
The famous March attic.

01:43:09.965 --> 01:43:13.199
I can see why this was
a young tomboy's playground.

01:43:13.201 --> 01:43:14.704
You really did read it.

01:43:16.271 --> 01:43:17.673
Mm-hmm.

01:43:34.990 --> 01:43:36.125
Jo, I'm sorry.

01:43:43.965 --> 01:43:46.169
I'm sorry for
how we left things.

01:43:50.972 --> 01:43:52.074
Me too.

01:43:54.709 --> 01:43:58.244
I was not ready
to hear the truth.

01:43:58.246 --> 01:44:00.950
But you were right.

01:44:01.851 --> 01:44:03.954
You ready for
some more truth?

01:44:05.954 --> 01:44:06.956
Let me guess.

01:44:08.657 --> 01:44:12.161
It was childish,
cliché...

01:44:14.163 --> 01:44:15.732
and my family is...

01:44:17.032 --> 01:44:19.736
weird and boring.

01:44:22.103 --> 01:44:23.804
The beginning was slow.

01:44:23.806 --> 01:44:25.738
Your structure needs work,

01:44:25.740 --> 01:44:29.042
and you have a tendency
for run-on sentences.

01:44:29.044 --> 01:44:31.213
But it's beautiful
and authentic.

01:44:33.048 --> 01:44:34.149
And I loved it.

01:44:36.951 --> 01:44:38.154
You did?

01:44:39.355 --> 01:44:40.889
I might have
even cried.

01:44:42.057 --> 01:44:43.158
Twice.

01:44:45.761 --> 01:44:46.996
I think this is the one.

01:44:49.298 --> 01:44:51.765
Come back
to New York with me.

01:44:51.767 --> 01:44:54.301
I can help you
get this book out.

01:44:54.303 --> 01:44:57.171
Beth wouldn't want you to stay here
and let your talents go to waste.

01:44:57.173 --> 01:44:58.108
Come back with me.

01:45:06.048 --> 01:45:07.480
That was supposed to be
my part.

01:45:07.482 --> 01:45:09.119
Get used to it.

01:45:27.837 --> 01:45:30.940
[no audible dialogue]

01:45:44.954 --> 01:45:48.023
[no audible dialogue]

01:45:55.097 --> 01:46:00.434
Hey, munchkins. What have you got?
Show me.

01:46:00.436 --> 01:46:03.173
Oh, it's so pretty.
Is this for Aunt Jo?

01:46:03.905 --> 01:46:05.975
Thank you so much.

01:46:23.124 --> 01:46:26.059
I cannot believe
I'm breaking my own oath.

01:46:26.061 --> 01:46:27.860
[all laugh]

01:46:27.862 --> 01:46:29.298
You didn't break
the important ones.

01:46:31.432 --> 01:46:34.835
I hate doing this
without her.

01:46:34.837 --> 01:46:36.772
She's here.

01:46:45.246 --> 01:46:46.883
I propose an oath.

01:46:53.054 --> 01:46:55.758
An oath to surpass
all other oaths.

01:47:06.168 --> 01:47:07.370
To always...

01:47:09.204 --> 01:47:13.909
always...
try and be as good...

01:47:15.977 --> 01:47:19.782
and sweet and strong...

01:47:23.118 --> 01:47:24.254
as our Beth.

01:47:25.454 --> 01:47:26.987
Always and forever.

01:47:26.989 --> 01:47:28.924
Always and forever.

01:47:51.246 --> 01:47:52.848
[all laughing]

01:47:55.250 --> 01:47:56.285
