00:04.350 --> 00:07.780
The download of the Iacon
database may have been incomplete,

00:08.370 --> 00:11.980
but we now possess four sets
of coordinates decoded by the ship.

00:11.990 --> 00:15.590
If we are to have any hope
of recovering the Iacon relics

00:15.600 --> 00:19.880
before the Decepticons do,
we must divide our resources.

00:19.890 --> 00:22.970
Dispatching multiple squadrons
will enable us to pursue

00:22.980 --> 00:25.320
all four coordinates simultaneously.

00:25.330 --> 00:27.400
Be on your guard, Bulkhead.

00:27.410 --> 00:29.000
<i>Ratchet, come here.</i>

00:29.010 --> 00:31.040
The Iacon database.

00:31.050 --> 00:33.380
It's downloading into our mainframe.

00:35.420 --> 00:39.390
Rafael, you are a genius!

00:39.400 --> 00:41.460
Bulkhead's coming through,
Agent Fowler.

00:41.470 --> 00:43.850
I can't wait to share the news.

00:48.040 --> 00:49.230

02:43.080 --> 02:45.380
- Yes!
- Initiate transport...

02:45.390 --> 02:48.190
and triangulate coordinates
of the other three relics.

02:48.200 --> 02:50.100
That was some trick, Miko.

02:51.200 --> 02:54.490
You mean, swiping intel from
right under Megatron's nose?

02:54.500 --> 02:56.610
Just doing my part for team Prime!

02:58.870 --> 03:02.240
Oh, got to go Bulk! I'll tell
you all about it when we get back.

03:02.240 --> 03:03.130
Wait up!

03:04.750 --> 03:09.140
- Take care of her, Bee.
- Take care of him, Miko.

03:11.200 --> 03:15.450
Bulkhead, prepare for departure.

03:15.460 --> 03:17.650
You are headed for the equator.

03:17.660 --> 03:21.160
I'll prep for tropical weather...
wrecker style.

03:21.940 --> 03:27.970
Rafael and Agent Fowler will be your
communications and transportation hub.

03:27.980 --> 03:29.950
<i>I can. That's cheeseburger!</i>

03:31.200 --> 03:33.560
Communications, huh?

03:36.230 --> 03:39.600
Be on your guard, Bulkhead.

04:10.430 --> 04:14.390
Base, I can't find
any sight of the relic.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.180
<i>Can you reconfirm coordinates?</i>

04:16.190 --> 04:20.820
Triangulating your position, Bulkhead.
You're at the correct location.

04:21.550 --> 04:24.030
Need coffee...

04:26.330 --> 04:30.520
And the coordinates are wrong,
'cause there is nothing here.

04:32.740 --> 04:35.910
But something's coming.

05:01.300 --> 05:05.480
Leave it to Megatron to send
a bug to do his dirty work.

05:05.490 --> 05:11.190
You're not afraid to do a part
of dirty work yourself, Wrecker.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.030
Do I know you?

05:13.040 --> 05:18.580
I know your kind as I have crossed
more than a few Wreckers in my time.

05:18.590 --> 05:21.760
Now you see the thing
about bugs your size.

05:21.770 --> 05:24.710
They make a bigger
mess when I smash them.

06:10.310 --> 06:14.740
Ratchet, the virus is coded.
Commencing upload.

06:14.750 --> 06:16.800
<i>Raf, I have a bead on the relic.</i>

06:16.810 --> 06:19.150
Raf is busy.
I'll take it from here.

06:19.160 --> 06:21.660
<i>Fowler?
How was your beauty sleep?</i>

06:21.670 --> 06:25.020
Fine. Jumped I finally
got low respect from you.

06:25.030 --> 06:26.930
Keep dreaming.

06:26.940 --> 06:28.070
<i>What's your status?</i>

06:28.080 --> 06:30.310
Came up empty to provided coordinates.

06:30.320 --> 06:33.930
But I'm figuring old lava flow
might have carried relic downhill.

06:33.940 --> 06:35.300
Wouldn't that just burn it up?

06:35.310 --> 06:37.890
<i>This relic survived
interstellar transport,</i>

06:37.900 --> 06:40.760
<i>I'm sure that can stand multi....
oh, scrap.</i>

06:40.770 --> 06:41.730
What is it?

06:41.740 --> 06:45.620
I'm leaking Energon.
Insecticon hit me hard.

06:45.670 --> 06:47.310
<i>Insecticon?</i>

06:47.320 --> 06:49.760
Probably not the gasket wheels.
Nothing to worry about.

06:49.770 --> 06:52.950
Trust me, he's a way
worse shape than I am.

06:59.040 --> 07:01.910
The Wrecker left me alive.

07:02.690 --> 07:06.310
The last mistake he will ever make.

07:20.370 --> 07:22.400
There you are!

07:28.400 --> 07:30.370
Got the lid off.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.330
O-oh.

07:34.340 --> 07:38.030
<i>Base...
we have a problem.</i>

07:38.740 --> 07:38.740
Bulkhead, what is it?

07:39.640 --> 07:43.500
<i> I found the relic.
It's a cash of Energon.</i>

07:43.510 --> 07:44.930
That's good, right?

07:44.940 --> 07:47.330
No-no-no, not this kind.

07:47.340 --> 07:52.650
It's known as Tox-En.
Causes nausy and dizziness upon contact.

07:52.660 --> 07:56.030
Prolong exposal weakens us
to the point of paralysis.

07:56.080 --> 07:59.560
And then...
it snuffs out our sparks.

08:06.020 --> 08:08.480
Well, what do you talking
to me for?

08:08.490 --> 08:11.300
Get far away from that Tox-En.
Prompto

08:11.310 --> 08:14.840
<i>If it is as deadly as you say,
the 'Cons won't want it either.</i>

08:14.850 --> 08:16.940
No, they'll want it even more.

08:17.280 --> 08:19.990
<i>During the war for Cybertron</i>

08:20.000 --> 08:23.110
<i>Megatron figured out
a way to refine raw Tox-En,</i>

08:23.170 --> 08:25.620
<i>turning it to a weapon
of mass destruction.</i>

08:25.630 --> 08:29.990
<i>I witnessed when entire unit
wiped out by the sickness.</i>

08:30.930 --> 08:34.559
No way I can leave this stuff
for 'Cons to find and abuse.

08:34.570 --> 08:38.039
So bring it back here.
Raf? Open a ground bridge.

08:38.100 --> 08:41.700
Forget it. Even if we had
a safe place to store it

08:41.780 --> 08:45.010
the stuff's way too potently
risky to exposing the rest of us...

08:45.330 --> 08:47.640
I'll call you back.

08:51.190 --> 08:56.100
I gonna need to take care
of this... Wrecker style.

09:02.320 --> 09:04.130
There.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.160
No! Wait!

09:33.400 --> 09:35.460
Tox-En.

09:35.900 --> 09:40.550
<i>Wait, you're carying it?
I thought that stuff was toxic.</i>

09:40.610 --> 09:44.970
It is. But I needed to put some
distance between me and the bugs.

09:45.050 --> 09:47.320
<i>Well, what now?</i>

09:47.350 --> 09:51.040
I'm gonna get rid of this
steaming pile the only way I can.

09:54.900 --> 09:58.160
I'm gonna lob it into the volcano.

09:58.220 --> 10:00.160
What about the insect problem?

10:00.190 --> 10:04.500
This isn't my first time
aluding an enemy patrol, you know.

10:09.250 --> 10:15.930
<i>Lord Megatron, the object
we seek... it is Tox-En.</i>

10:15.960 --> 10:18.950
Exactly how much is in your possession?

10:19.000 --> 10:21.590
<i>But, my lord, an autobot...</i>

10:21.640 --> 10:24.950
Are you not the fearest insecticon?

10:26.900 --> 10:31.130
Wait, you're moving
away from the volcano?

10:31.190 --> 10:33.010
Exactly.

10:41.870 --> 10:44.240
Below.

10:54.120 --> 10:58.640
Yes.  The Wrecker
leaks from his wounds.

10:58.690 --> 11:00.810
Find him!

11:14.500 --> 11:17.220
<i>You did the false trail, huh?</i>

11:17.250 --> 11:21.590
I won't fall for that trick when I've got
separated from my unit behind enemy lines.

11:21.630 --> 11:23.560
<i>When where you ever behind enemy lines?</i>

11:23.560 --> 11:24.570
I wasn't always a bot-sitter.
<i>When where you ever behind enemy lines?</i>

11:24.570 --> 11:25.360
I wasn't always a bot-sitter.

11:26.950 --> 11:31.380
<i>Next you gonna tell me your
mother doesn't tuck you in at night?</i>

11:31.420 --> 11:33.700
<i>That's our basic training.</i>

11:33.740 --> 11:37.170
Training as what?
A rodeo clown?

11:37.460 --> 11:41.570
You was better way too much
having monster truck rally with Miko.

11:41.630 --> 11:45.150
I was an army ranger. We could
wreck with the best of them.

11:45.190 --> 11:47.380
<i>Who knew you and I are so much alike.</i>

11:47.420 --> 11:51.590
<i>Rafael! Has Agent Fowler
regained consciousness?</i>

11:51.620 --> 11:53.900
Stand by, Bulkhead.
I'll be right back.

11:53.940 --> 11:56.760
I'm here, Prime.
What's the situation?

11:56.820 --> 12:01.440
<i>I require access to a research
facility at my current coordinates.</i>

12:01.470 --> 12:02.860
Let me make a call.

12:25.040 --> 12:29.880
The dirty job.
That only a Wrecker can do.

12:33.070 --> 12:34.770
C'mon

12:37.870 --> 12:39.710
This is an emergency!

12:39.750 --> 12:42.550
Our satellites have detected
dangerous solar flare activity!

12:42.600 --> 12:46.080
I need that entire station
evacuated immediately!

12:46.120 --> 12:48.790
Do you hear me?
Get out of there, now!

12:48.880 --> 12:52.830
Base is clear, Prime.
Try not to wreck the joint.

12:52.890 --> 12:55.120
<i>My thanks, Agent Fowler.</i>

12:55.840 --> 12:59.010
Bulkhead, are you holding up?

13:02.220 --> 13:04.910
Anyway, for Miko.

13:04.950 --> 13:08.910
<i>Don't worry about her. You need
to focus on your own mission.</i>

13:09.300 --> 13:10.820
Right.

13:10.820 --> 13:11.810
I...

13:11.860 --> 13:16.580
I need to... rest...
just for a minute.

13:16.610 --> 13:20.320
<i>I know it's tough, but I
need you to stay on the course.</i>

13:34.150 --> 13:35.160
<i>Bulkhead.</i>

13:35.510 --> 13:38.510
<i>Bulkhead!
Bulkhead!</i>

13:42.860 --> 13:44.070
<i>Bulkhead! </i>

13:44.120 --> 13:47.300
Bulkhead!
Answer me, you, rustbucket!

13:48.420 --> 13:51.500
<i>I'm here, ranger.</i>

13:52.140 --> 13:55.520
You had me scared two tonnes

13:55.900 --> 14:02.160
I...
I can't do it.

14:02.230 --> 14:04.420
<i>I do not want to hear that kind of talk.</i>

14:04.450 --> 14:06.290
<i>Especially from the likes of you.</i>

14:06.350 --> 14:08.430
<i>We both know you've
made it through worse.</i>

14:08.460 --> 14:11.450
<i>Down! Down!</i>

14:34.200 --> 14:39.090
Not worse than this.
Not even scraplets.

14:39.160 --> 14:42.220
<i>Look, soldier, you know as
well as I do there is a mission</i>

14:42.280 --> 14:44.640
<i>and the reason why
you take the mission.</i>

14:44.700 --> 14:47.380
Honor ...
duty ...

14:47.440 --> 14:48.540
<i>family!</i>

14:48.640 --> 14:50.780
<i>Which is why you need
to do whatever it takes</i>

14:50.830 --> 14:53.880
<i>to finish this job
and come home safely.</i>

14:54.610 --> 14:58.080
Miko, I am supposed
to be protecting you.

14:58.120 --> 15:02.130
Bulkhead. I'm strapped tight
inside ten tons of metal muscles.

15:02.180 --> 15:03.960
I am protected.

15:07.610 --> 15:11.120
Miko, check it out.
New battle scars.

15:13.850 --> 15:15.790
Miko?

15:15.830 --> 15:18.530
I heaved on your floor mats.
Sorry.

15:18.580 --> 15:21.190
Before I became a warrior,
I was a labourer.

15:21.260 --> 15:25.350
- I can build stuff, I can break stuff.
- I wanna be just like you, Bulk.

15:25.410 --> 15:27.890
No, you need to stop, now!

15:27.940 --> 15:32.250
I can't, Bulk.
I have to get you out of here...

15:32.320 --> 15:36.960
Bulkhead, I know somewhere
inside you always remember me.

15:37.010 --> 15:41.430
And I just want you to know,
I'll never forget you.

15:43.650 --> 15:47.160
You're right, Fowler ...

15:47.220 --> 15:49.330
I gotta dig deep...

15:49.400 --> 15:52.030
for the other bots...

15:52.920 --> 15:54.920
for Miko!

16:05.990 --> 16:09.350
There is no logic to his movements.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.810
His trail has meant
to lead us astray.

16:11.850 --> 16:15.690
To find the Wrecker we must not follow...

16:16.430 --> 16:20.740
we must anticipate.

16:34.150 --> 16:37.500
Almost there.

16:38.820 --> 16:43.730
That's right, soldier. Dump
that rock and come on home.

16:43.760 --> 16:47.300
Fowler.
Miko, what is it?

16:47.390 --> 16:48.840
What in Sam hill?

16:48.910 --> 16:51.330
I'm in the middle of a crisis here
and you want me to...

16:52.680 --> 16:55.530
Uh, put him on the line.

17:03.540 --> 17:06.130
<i>Wrecker!</i>

17:12.369 --> 17:17.390
Put down the rock and allow us
to put you out of your misery.

17:26.430 --> 17:30.090
Gotta swat some flies.

17:45.210 --> 17:49.270
Fair warning....
I'm contagious.

18:03.080 --> 18:05.540
Hold this.

18:13.470 --> 18:18.290
Mr. Vogel this is special Agent William
Fowler of the United States government.

18:18.310 --> 18:20.570
You are hereby deputized
as an honorable Agent ...

18:20.630 --> 18:24.090
for department of...
interstellar relations.

18:25.230 --> 18:27.530
Bulkhead, you still with me?

18:27.570 --> 18:30.570
I'm in the scrap and you put me on hold?

18:30.630 --> 18:35.610
<i>I want you to know...
Miko safe, mission accomplished.</i>

18:36.710 --> 18:39.410
That's my girl.

18:59.880 --> 19:04.910
Scurrydown, contact the
warship for a containment unit.

19:18.960 --> 19:21.150
<i>Bulkhead, do you read me?</i>

19:21.190 --> 19:24.160
<i>Ratchet, come here.</i>

19:24.250 --> 19:26.460
Bulkhead, please respond!

19:26.530 --> 19:28.830
The Iacon database?

19:28.880 --> 19:30.920
It's downloading into our mainframe.

19:30.990 --> 19:32.640
Answer me, soldier!

19:34.000 --> 19:38.090
Rafael, you are a genius!

19:38.140 --> 19:39.740
Will you keep it down?

19:43.320 --> 19:47.820
Your spark is mine, Wrecker.

20:03.190 --> 20:06.650
You wanna taste of this?
Do you?

20:15.700 --> 20:17.930
Catch!

20:39.060 --> 20:43.170
Fowler, mission accomplished.

20:43.210 --> 20:47.230
But you may have to...
tuck me in.

20:47.260 --> 20:50.760
Raf, open the bridge!
Now!

21:20.100 --> 21:21.840
No!
