WEBVTT

00:02.261 --> 00:04.390
I swear this is the last one.

00:04.415 --> 00:05.758
You positive? 'Cause I'm just not sure

00:05.782 --> 00:07.660
you kept enough of our old stuff.

00:08.048 --> 00:10.127
Well, I mean, look at those booties.

00:10.152 --> 00:13.198
Come on. How could
I get rid of those booties?

00:13.223 --> 00:15.648
Because... Ew,
they're covered in mildew.

00:15.673 --> 00:17.551
Wow. Zoey. I didn't realize

00:17.576 --> 00:19.664
you were such a fan
of Cabbage Patch Kids.

00:19.689 --> 00:21.333
Actually, that was mine.

00:21.358 --> 00:22.421
Oh.

00:22.446 --> 00:23.703
And this...

00:23.728 --> 00:24.953
Mine as well.

00:24.978 --> 00:26.750
Oh, babe.

00:26.775 --> 00:29.382
No wonder you became such a
bleeding-heart public defender.

00:29.690 --> 00:31.203
You really care, bear.

00:31.228 --> 00:35.140
Yeah, David was always a very
sweet, sensitive child.

00:35.165 --> 00:36.515
How do you describe me?

00:36.540 --> 00:39.265
- You were more inquisitive.
- Mm.

00:39.290 --> 00:42.710
You only wanted science
and engineering toys.

00:42.735 --> 00:44.980
Damn straight. These
were my gateway drugs

00:45.005 --> 00:48.257
to straight As and a
stunning scholastic career.

00:49.868 --> 00:51.281
Um, if it's okay with Zoey,

00:51.306 --> 00:53.390
you can take whatever
you want for the baby.

00:53.415 --> 00:57.459
Oh, yeah. Um, I'm good. All yours.

00:57.484 --> 01:00.085
Be right back.
I'm just gonna make a quick call.

01:01.257 --> 01:02.507
You forgot another one.

01:02.532 --> 01:05.796
So, I'll meet you at the
flower market in an hour?

01:06.852 --> 01:09.390
I'm excited, too, Jessica.

01:09.415 --> 01:11.289
Okay. Bye.

01:12.372 --> 01:13.875
Jessica?

01:14.676 --> 01:16.398
Why so secretive?

01:17.750 --> 01:20.210
I just... I feel weird

01:20.235 --> 01:23.750
talking about work stuff
in front of your dad.

01:24.243 --> 01:25.687
Hm.

01:25.977 --> 01:28.015
Since we're alone for a minute,

01:28.040 --> 01:29.921
what new on the Simon front?

01:29.946 --> 01:31.359
You'd be very proud.

01:31.384 --> 01:33.554
I haven't texted him
back in a couple days.

01:33.579 --> 01:35.328
How do you feel about that?

01:35.353 --> 01:38.932
Um, only minor withdrawals.

01:38.957 --> 01:40.226
Hm.

01:41.726 --> 01:44.234
Oh, my gosh. Dad, you remember this?

01:44.259 --> 01:46.234
Wow, it actually still works.

01:58.970 --> 02:00.445
Oh, you lost.

02:00.470 --> 02:03.758
All right, okay,
I hate to spoil this lovely symphony,

02:03.783 --> 02:06.695
but can we focus?
I've got to get to work soon.

02:06.720 --> 02:08.663
We're good to build
the crib tonight, right?

02:08.689 --> 02:10.767
Um, you know,
I'm still prepping for trial.

02:10.792 --> 02:13.468
The... the O'Reilly case?

02:13.692 --> 02:16.210
Think it's going to be another
late night at the office.

02:16.235 --> 02:17.523
Again?

02:17.967 --> 02:19.718
This case has taken over your life.

02:19.743 --> 02:21.273
I'm not happy about it either.

02:21.298 --> 02:23.023
Yeah, it's just, we said we were gonna

02:23.048 --> 02:24.468
get cracking on this weeks ago,

02:24.493 --> 02:28.040
and it seems like it's never
the right time with you.

02:28.444 --> 02:29.445
Now that we know it's a boy,

02:29.469 --> 02:30.782
we can really start to get organized.

02:30.806 --> 02:33.015
Em, I get it, okay? I get it.

02:33.137 --> 02:34.835
All right? I'm doing
the best that I can.

02:34.860 --> 02:37.609
Everything... okay?

02:37.634 --> 02:39.523

Synced & corrected by QueenMaddie

04:33.771 --> 04:35.054
Guess what?

04:35.079 --> 04:38.334
I just heard my first actual duet.

04:38.359 --> 04:41.437
Two people singing the same song,
at the same time.

04:41.462 --> 04:43.106
I am very aware of what a duet is.

04:43.130 --> 04:46.076
But now it raises all sorts
of questions for us to tackle.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.164
Ugh, why do I even
answer the phone this early?

04:48.189 --> 04:50.053
I am an artist, Zoey, and my brain

04:50.078 --> 04:52.816
does not like functioning
until night o'clock.

04:52.840 --> 04:54.945
But I just don't know which one to help.

04:54.970 --> 04:56.086
Or maybe it's both.

04:56.110 --> 04:59.593
And I'm sure we can figure all
this out over drinks tonight.

04:59.618 --> 05:01.196
Okay, fine. Where do you wanna go?

05:01.221 --> 05:02.792
Somewhere basic and hetero.

05:02.817 --> 05:04.953
I'm in the mood for potato skins.

05:04.978 --> 05:06.406
<i>'Kay, bye.</i>

05:07.855 --> 05:09.733
Now that the SprqPoint
watch is out there

05:09.757 --> 05:13.003
dazzling users with its sheer
brilliance of engineering,

05:13.027 --> 05:15.305
we are ready to move
on to a new project.

05:15.329 --> 05:17.203
However, before we do,

05:17.228 --> 05:19.508
your manager, Zoey, feels that we need

05:19.533 --> 05:22.592
to foster a more open,
honest work environment,

05:22.617 --> 05:25.881
and that's why, today,
we'll be sharing the results

05:25.906 --> 05:28.699
of the anonymous peer reviews
that you wrote about each other

05:28.724 --> 05:30.156
a few weeks back.

05:30.625 --> 05:31.821
Hmm?

05:31.846 --> 05:35.312
I thought the peer reviews
were for internal use only.

05:35.487 --> 05:37.427
What's the good of bad
news if you can't share it?

05:37.451 --> 05:39.540
Am I right? Zoey and I will
meet with you individually

05:39.564 --> 05:41.781
to go over the results
of what your friends

05:41.806 --> 05:44.085
and colleagues had to say about you.

05:44.110 --> 05:46.101
Tobin Batra.

05:46.126 --> 05:47.539
- Hit me.
- Okay, well,

05:47.564 --> 05:50.539
aside from several of them commenting

05:50.564 --> 05:53.514
on your extreme overuse
of the eggplant emoji,

05:53.539 --> 05:55.378
in general, their feedback
regarding your work

05:55.402 --> 05:57.736
was that it is... adequate.

05:58.971 --> 06:00.315
Boo-yah!

06:00.340 --> 06:02.632
Love barely meeting expectations.

06:05.753 --> 06:08.253
Max...

06:09.523 --> 06:10.981
Oh, Richman.

06:11.006 --> 06:13.351
Yep. Same last name
I had five years ago...

06:13.376 --> 06:14.820
when I started working here.

06:14.845 --> 06:16.966
Uh, "Lacks drive," "Is complacent,"

06:16.991 --> 06:19.669
"Doesn't show initiative,"
"Takes the easy way out,"

06:19.693 --> 06:23.507
"Settles when he could
be working much harder."

06:23.531 --> 06:25.141
- All...
- Bad.

06:25.165 --> 06:26.165
Constructive.

06:26.190 --> 06:28.669
Lot of great stuff to build on.

06:28.694 --> 06:30.578
Is it... great?

06:30.722 --> 06:32.733
Feels not so great.

06:33.742 --> 06:36.519
Okay, Leif, ready to hear what
your colleagues had to say?

06:36.544 --> 06:38.388
Only if you feel it's necessary.

06:38.412 --> 06:40.991
I know that all three of us know

06:41.015 --> 06:44.062
that, uh, as the best programmer here,

06:44.220 --> 06:45.929
I'm, uh... what's the word? Beloved.

06:45.954 --> 06:48.197
Um, okay.

06:48.222 --> 06:51.668
"Leif is self-righteous
and overly ambitious."

06:51.692 --> 06:53.336
"His 'aw-shucks' demeanor

06:53.360 --> 06:56.673
"masks a relentless drive
to win at all costs,

06:56.697 --> 06:59.031
"which is more
alienating than endearing.

06:59.056 --> 07:01.351
That's probably why he
didn't get the promotion."

07:03.486 --> 07:04.897
Wow.

07:04.922 --> 07:07.664
Uh, I was... I was not expecting that.

07:08.375 --> 07:10.086
May I ask who...

07:10.110 --> 07:12.489
It's anonymous, the peer reviews.

07:12.513 --> 07:14.679
It's called "anonymous peer review."

07:15.473 --> 07:18.351
Well, uh, thank you

07:18.376 --> 07:22.359
for your... honesty

07:22.875 --> 07:25.984
and your feedback.

07:31.414 --> 07:33.776
Well... that was fun.

07:33.801 --> 07:35.512
Wait, you never said what
people wrote about me.

07:35.536 --> 07:37.080
I'm sure the team had thoughts.

07:37.104 --> 07:38.848
Oh, "the team had thoughts."

07:38.872 --> 07:40.450
But you know, "misogyny, misogyny."

07:40.474 --> 07:43.093
I think you're crushing it.
That's all that matters.

07:47.140 --> 07:48.959
Is this the kind of
place you had in mind?

07:48.983 --> 07:51.227
Men in Dockers, full-calorie beer,

07:51.251 --> 07:53.570
corporate types looking
to unwind, it's perfect.

07:53.595 --> 07:55.331
I invited Max to join us, too.

07:55.356 --> 07:56.860
He had a rough day at work.
I hope that's okay.

07:56.884 --> 07:58.118
Fine with me. But before he gets here,

07:58.142 --> 08:01.195
let's talk about this duet.
Was it romantic? Depressing?

08:01.220 --> 08:04.007
It was... tortured.

08:04.032 --> 08:05.687
Oh! The best duets are.

08:05.712 --> 08:09.560
My brother and sister-in-law
were singing at each other.

08:09.585 --> 08:11.514
She seemed more upset than he did.

08:11.538 --> 08:13.710
Seems like she's the one
you're supposed to help, then.

08:13.735 --> 08:16.247
Oh! I hope not.

08:16.272 --> 08:18.054
Emily and I aren't really the tightest.

08:18.079 --> 08:22.226
She's kind of acerbic,
I'm kind of stand-offish.

08:22.251 --> 08:23.821
You two would be great
in a female cop show.

08:23.845 --> 08:25.656
My brother's totally harmless.

08:25.681 --> 08:27.258
I'm sure she's upset about something

08:27.283 --> 08:28.461
that isn't even his fault.

08:28.486 --> 08:29.996
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

08:30.021 --> 08:31.533
Autumn's coming, too,
but she thought she saw

08:31.557 --> 08:33.289
a rainbow in an oil slick outside,

08:33.313 --> 08:35.859
so she's still absorbing its beauty.

08:35.884 --> 08:37.671
You know, you've been very tight-lipped

08:37.696 --> 08:38.890
about Autumn since Napa.

08:38.914 --> 08:40.445
Did you have a good time?

08:40.470 --> 08:42.410
Uh, yeah. Napa was fun.

08:42.436 --> 08:45.448
I'm just not sure we're
totally on the same wavelength,

08:45.472 --> 08:48.318
a word she uses endlessly, by the way.

08:48.342 --> 08:52.101
I thought you dug her whole
adorable flower child...

08:52.126 --> 08:53.804
Meets-young-Kristin-Chenoweth vibe.

08:53.829 --> 08:55.206
Autumn hated being on a schedule

08:55.231 --> 08:57.375
and wanted to just
run through the fields.

08:57.400 --> 09:01.031
She unironically chased a
butterfly for 37 minutes.

09:01.056 --> 09:02.351
- Oh, my God, Max.
- Hi.

09:02.376 --> 09:05.088
You better not be telling
them about Napa without me.

09:05.113 --> 09:08.039
It was pure magic.

09:12.489 --> 09:14.133
Kick it!

09:15.293 --> 09:16.793

- David?

10:35.917 --> 10:38.251
What's going on?

10:39.293 --> 10:41.864
Zoey, hi. What are you, um...

10:41.889 --> 10:42.889
What are you doing here?

10:42.914 --> 10:45.031
Just hanging out with some friends.

10:45.056 --> 10:47.635
I thought you had to work tonight.

10:47.660 --> 10:49.156
Oh... Oh, no, I am working.

10:49.181 --> 10:50.810
These are colleagues.

10:50.835 --> 10:53.281
Some of our best legal
breakthroughs happen

10:53.306 --> 10:54.820
when we're shooting pool.

10:55.694 --> 10:57.562
- Cool.
- Yeah, cool.

10:58.250 --> 11:00.960
Okay. Well, don't let me
stop the work sesh.

11:00.985 --> 11:03.040
That's no problem. Yeah.
Yeah, but I should get back.

11:03.064 --> 11:04.313
- Have a great night.
- You have a great night.

11:04.337 --> 11:05.765
Yeah. Yeah.

11:12.625 --> 11:15.164
There she is.
Thought you ghosted on me.

11:15.189 --> 11:16.849
Not responding to any of my texts.

11:16.874 --> 11:18.284
It's really hard to ghost somebody

11:18.308 --> 11:20.386
when you work just
50 feet away from them.

11:20.410 --> 11:21.877
All good.

11:23.471 --> 11:26.550
So... can I ask you a question?

11:26.575 --> 11:29.561
As a man in a long-term relationship,

11:29.586 --> 11:31.414
how bad would it be if you told Jessica

11:31.439 --> 11:32.665
that you had to work late but instead

11:32.689 --> 11:34.335
went to play pool with the guys?

11:34.681 --> 11:36.859
I'd probably...

11:36.884 --> 11:38.843
lose a limb or two and maybe

11:38.868 --> 11:40.485
spend a week on the couch. Why?

11:40.510 --> 11:42.064
Because I saw my brother out last night,

11:42.088 --> 11:43.299
and I know he's lying to his wife.

11:43.323 --> 11:45.601
Ooh. Well...

11:45.626 --> 11:47.938
it's always hard to judge
someone else's relationship,

11:47.963 --> 11:50.446
but maybe he just needed
some time to himself,

11:50.471 --> 11:51.892
and it's hard to tell
her for some reason.

11:51.916 --> 11:53.446
- Mm-hmm.
- I think if it was just

11:54.729 --> 11:56.196
you can cut him some slack.

11:56.221 --> 11:57.516
Okay.

11:58.088 --> 11:59.555
Thank you.

11:59.580 --> 12:01.219
You're welcome.

12:07.108 --> 12:08.774
Are you all right?

12:11.361 --> 12:13.586
Something's going on with you,
I can tell.

12:19.422 --> 12:22.064
- How do you do that?
- Do what?

12:22.089 --> 12:25.468
Really... see me.

12:25.493 --> 12:27.004
No one else has that ability.

12:27.029 --> 12:28.580
Oh. Um...

12:28.605 --> 12:29.845
I guess...

12:29.870 --> 12:31.869
Usually it takes a whole song-and-dance

12:31.894 --> 12:33.713
for me to understand
what someone's feeling.

12:33.738 --> 12:36.291
But with you, I guess...

12:38.269 --> 12:40.759
I just know how to read you.

12:41.431 --> 12:43.937
Uh, my dad's birthday's
coming up in a couple days,

12:43.961 --> 12:47.242
and it's the first since
his suicide, so...

12:48.328 --> 12:50.914
I guess it's just bringing
up a lot of stuff.

12:51.692 --> 12:53.398
Well, I am here if you need me.

12:53.423 --> 12:55.968
Like I said, just 50 feet that way.

12:55.993 --> 12:57.416
Mm-hmm. Right over there?

12:57.441 --> 12:59.632
- Right over there.
- Okey dokey.

- Never better.
- You sure?

14:08.665 --> 14:10.453
'Cause you're hiding
in an isolation pod.

14:10.478 --> 14:11.640
Yep.

14:11.665 --> 14:13.336
It was just one person's opinion,

14:13.361 --> 14:15.726
and we don't even know who wrote it.

14:15.751 --> 14:18.297
- I just figured it was you.
- It wasn't.

14:19.256 --> 14:21.187
I think you're an excellent programmer.

14:21.212 --> 14:23.195
I don't expect you to understand this,

14:23.220 --> 14:25.523
Little Miss Perfect Score On The S.A.T.

14:25.548 --> 14:26.782
What did you get on the S.A.T.?

14:26.806 --> 14:28.784
Also a perfect score. Not the point.

14:29.718 --> 14:33.218
I'm just not used to negative feedback.

14:33.243 --> 14:35.570
You don't get the pressure
that I put on myself,

14:35.595 --> 14:37.047
that my family puts on me.

14:37.072 --> 14:41.853
One of my brothers is chief
oncologist at Johns Hopkins,

14:41.878 --> 14:43.822
and the other runs a
billion-dollar hedge fund.

14:43.847 --> 14:46.875
Well, I'm sure in a few years,
you too will be...

14:46.900 --> 14:48.445
They're my younger brothers.

14:49.169 --> 14:54.398
You know, I think
I would like to be alone.

15:01.967 --> 15:03.702
Look at you two.

15:03.727 --> 15:05.827
Power couple alert.

15:05.852 --> 15:09.398
And you have your own coffee
table book, too? I had no idea.

15:09.423 --> 15:12.116
Only because people were interested

15:12.141 --> 15:14.616
in NorCal homes for 10 seconds.

15:14.641 --> 15:16.851
Or because you have impeccable taste,

15:16.876 --> 15:18.445
and you're very good at your job.

15:18.470 --> 15:20.483
What's it been like working with
your husband all these years?

15:20.507 --> 15:22.952
It always came easy to us.

15:22.977 --> 15:24.988
I mean, we just laughed a lot,

15:25.013 --> 15:27.780
and we respected each other's strengths.

15:27.805 --> 15:30.937
I always handled the creative stuff,

15:30.962 --> 15:33.875
and Mitch is more the...

15:33.900 --> 15:38.273
Was more the business side of things.

15:38.298 --> 15:40.171
And I was the kid always wanting

15:40.196 --> 15:44.280
to do science experiments
in my mom's greenhouse.

15:44.305 --> 15:47.163
Yes, mostly on worms. Poor worms.

15:47.188 --> 15:48.968
I'm glad we got through that phase.

15:48.993 --> 15:51.171
Where is David? I thought
he was supposed

15:51.219 --> 15:53.351
to stay home with Dad tonight
and give you some time off.

15:53.375 --> 15:54.920
He's just running late. It's okay.

15:54.945 --> 15:58.655
I mean, we're hard at work here.
I am deep in the zone.

15:58.680 --> 15:59.991
What are you guys making?

16:00.016 --> 16:02.226
Oh, just playing with
various flower combinations

16:02.251 --> 16:03.668
for the engagement party.

16:03.693 --> 16:05.726
- Great.
- What do you think?

16:06.491 --> 16:07.655
It's very pretty.

16:07.680 --> 16:09.124
That's my favorite, too.

16:09.149 --> 16:10.663
Okay, I'm gonna go.

16:10.688 --> 16:13.101
Thanks so much for everything, Maggie.
Have a great night.

16:13.126 --> 16:14.604
Oh, I'll call you as soon as

16:14.629 --> 16:16.673
I get an estimate for the rose wall.

16:16.698 --> 16:18.171
Thank you.

16:19.847 --> 16:23.226
So, how was being
at the flower mart again?

16:23.251 --> 16:24.889
It was nice.

16:24.914 --> 16:26.733
A little sad, you know.

16:26.758 --> 16:29.036
Everybody asked about your father.

16:29.061 --> 16:32.092
They miss him coming around,
joking with everybody.

16:32.117 --> 16:35.162
- You moving?
- Oh, no.

16:35.187 --> 16:37.099
Do you remember Linda Nathanson?

16:37.124 --> 16:39.217
We did her place a few years back,

16:39.242 --> 16:42.881
and anyway,
she's bought this crazy estate,

16:42.906 --> 16:45.202
and she asked me to do her garden.

16:45.227 --> 16:46.704
That's great.

16:46.981 --> 16:49.655
I told her I would think about it.

16:49.680 --> 16:50.928
Why not do the job?

16:50.953 --> 16:54.654
Because it wouldn't be
working with your dad, Zoey.

16:55.502 --> 16:58.460
It just feels weird and kinda wrong

16:58.485 --> 17:01.717
to do a job right now without him, so...

17:02.232 --> 17:06.233
Well, I feel like Dad
would be thrilled for you.

17:08.852 --> 17:10.592
Oh.

17:10.617 --> 17:12.592
David's not gonna be able to make it.

17:12.617 --> 17:13.741
Why not?

17:13.766 --> 17:17.280
He has to work late again
on the O'Reilly case.

17:17.305 --> 17:19.038
Hmm.

17:24.338 --> 17:26.795
Care to tell me what
the hell is going on?

17:26.819 --> 17:28.271
Jesus.

17:33.123 --> 17:35.002
How did you know I was here?

17:35.538 --> 17:38.194
O'Reilly's Tavern? Really, David?

17:38.219 --> 17:40.092
The O'Reilly case?

17:40.608 --> 17:42.327
Listen, your marriage is your business,

17:42.352 --> 17:44.381
but you lied to Mom tonight,
which is not cool

17:44.406 --> 17:45.765
because you and I agreed that together

17:45.789 --> 17:47.813
- we were going to take care of Mom.
- I can't handle all this,

17:47.837 --> 17:49.624
Zoey, all right? I'm drowning at work.

17:49.649 --> 17:50.689
All I do is think about Dad.

17:50.713 --> 17:52.017
I feel like I'm
responsible for everyone.

17:52.041 --> 17:53.876
Sometimes I just feel
like I gotta break out

17:53.901 --> 17:56.649
and, like, forget about
everything for a while.

17:56.674 --> 17:59.708
David, if anyone can
understand that, it's me.

18:01.764 --> 18:03.797
Something else is wrong.

18:04.985 --> 18:07.001
I mean, yeah.

18:07.026 --> 18:09.251
Look at this. Look at this.

18:09.276 --> 18:13.180
Oh, my God!

18:14.543 --> 18:17.165
Can I take a picture?
I'm gonna take a picture.

18:18.497 --> 18:19.946
You're having a baby, David.

18:19.971 --> 18:22.235
No, I'm having a boy.

18:22.260 --> 18:24.032
Wait. What's wrong with that?

18:24.057 --> 18:26.568
Zoey, have you forgotten
my entire childhood?

18:26.853 --> 18:30.274
I wasn't exactly the most
manly kid on the block.

18:30.299 --> 18:33.024
You were, too.

18:33.049 --> 18:35.860
I had framed theater
playbills all over my walls.

18:35.885 --> 18:37.852
I didn't make out
with a girl until college.

18:37.877 --> 18:40.704
Kids used to make fun of me.
I guess I'm just...

18:41.962 --> 18:44.922
worried that things will
be the same way for my son.

18:47.741 --> 18:50.415
Well, maybe he'll be the opposite.

18:50.440 --> 18:52.008
Maybe he'll be a super jock.

18:52.033 --> 18:54.563
That's even worse, okay?
I don't like sports.

18:54.588 --> 18:55.798
I don't even know
why I'm here right now.

18:55.822 --> 18:58.165
The guys from the office,
they drag me to this place.

18:58.190 --> 19:00.338
- I hate it here.
- They have pretty good potato skins.

19:00.362 --> 19:01.706
Great potato skins.

19:01.731 --> 19:03.618
Have you discussed
any of this with Emily?

19:03.643 --> 19:05.666
She's got enough of her own
stuff going on right now.

19:05.690 --> 19:08.672
Well, I mean, I feel like she
already knows something's up.

19:08.697 --> 19:10.666
Since when do you know what
goes on inside of Emily's head?

19:10.690 --> 19:13.251
You're not exactly BFFs...
or even Fs really.

19:13.276 --> 19:14.564
Just talk to her. It couldn't hurt.

19:14.588 --> 19:16.321
Fine, when I'm ready, but just please

19:16.346 --> 19:18.657
promise to keep this
conversation between us, okay?

19:18.682 --> 19:19.962
Especially the playbill stuff.

19:19.987 --> 19:22.969
Emily doesn't know about it,
and she hates musical theater.

19:29.538 --> 19:31.360
What is all this?

19:31.477 --> 19:33.922
It's a grief kit. Um...

19:33.947 --> 19:35.492
for your dad's birthday.

19:35.517 --> 19:36.712
If you need it.

19:39.185 --> 19:41.290
- A pillow?
- To scream into.

19:41.315 --> 19:43.016
Or absorb your tears. You decide.

19:43.048 --> 19:44.305
There's also a hammer to bust things up

19:44.329 --> 19:45.807
and a package of Oreos
to eat your feelings,

19:45.831 --> 19:47.422
and tequila, because...

19:48.046 --> 19:49.594
tequila.

19:49.921 --> 19:51.618
I love it.

19:51.800 --> 19:53.758
I thought it could go either way.

19:54.659 --> 19:57.894
But it's what I would want
when that day happens.

20:02.171 --> 20:03.751
Please tell me you have some fun plans

20:03.776 --> 20:05.158
so you're not alone tomorrow night.

20:05.182 --> 20:07.594
Yeah. Jessica got us tickets
to the Warriors game.

20:07.619 --> 20:09.133
- That'll be nice.
- Yeah.

20:09.158 --> 20:10.502
She's trying her best to cheer me up.

20:10.526 --> 20:15.362
Well, I'm glad that
the basket was a success.

20:16.934 --> 20:19.010
Oh, and fair warning.

20:19.035 --> 20:21.612
That package of Oreos
might not be entirely full.

20:28.278 --> 20:29.526
Hey.

20:30.680 --> 20:31.862
Look who's feeling better.

20:31.887 --> 20:34.721
Writing some great new
product ideas in your journal?

20:37.031 --> 20:38.971
I'll take that as a no.

20:40.147 --> 20:41.424
Uh-oh.

20:41.449 --> 20:43.128
Don't tell me you're depressed, too.

20:43.495 --> 20:45.588
Wow. It's like a freakin' epidemic.

20:45.613 --> 20:48.125
Sorry, it's just that
Autumn suddenly decided

20:48.150 --> 20:49.428
that she wants me to meet her parents

20:49.452 --> 20:50.657
next weekend when they come into town.

20:50.681 --> 20:52.375
That's nice, isn't it?

20:52.400 --> 20:54.878
Well, yeah. It's just... It's
a very next-level move.

20:54.903 --> 20:56.781
And I don't know what my problem is.

20:56.806 --> 20:58.867
I mean, she's sweet, she's pretty.

20:58.892 --> 21:01.195
I just think that one
meal turns into another,

21:01.220 --> 21:03.524
which turns into an invite to
their cabin for the holidays,

21:03.548 --> 21:05.195
which turns into me
moving to Minneapolis

21:05.220 --> 21:07.157
just so her parents can be
closer to their grandkids.

21:07.181 --> 21:09.008
I just don't know that I'm
ready to leave San Francisco

21:09.032 --> 21:10.835
for the simple life yet, Zoey.

21:10.860 --> 21:14.740
Well, that's a version
of what could happen.

21:14.922 --> 21:17.075
Do you think I'm over-thinking it?

21:17.100 --> 21:19.512
You know what? It's fine.

21:19.537 --> 21:21.857
Everything with Autumn
is very nice and easy.

21:21.882 --> 21:24.732
I can meet her parents.
Yeah, that's not a big deal.

21:24.757 --> 21:26.888
I want you to do
whatever you want to do.

21:26.913 --> 21:29.892
I just want to see you be happy,
and I don't want you to settle.

21:29.917 --> 21:31.833
Sounds just like my peer reviews.

21:32.249 --> 21:33.726
Oh, my God.

21:34.125 --> 21:35.849
Am I doing the same
thing in my relationship

21:35.874 --> 21:37.852
that everyone says I'm doing at work?

21:41.822 --> 21:43.224
Hello?

21:44.018 --> 21:45.833
Hey, Emily. Nice to hear your...

21:46.717 --> 21:48.935
Mm-hmm, yeah, sure, we can talk.

21:49.420 --> 21:50.997
This is kind of a surprise.

21:51.022 --> 21:55.097
You and I have never had a
proper sister-in-law hang.

21:55.122 --> 21:57.582
Yeah, I just thought
it might be nice for us

21:57.607 --> 21:59.585
to spend some quality time.

22:00.007 --> 22:03.215
So, tell me, how's your life?
How's work?

22:03.240 --> 22:04.981
Oh, it's kinda crazy,
actually. We just...

22:05.006 --> 22:06.809
I think something's wrong with David.

22:07.506 --> 22:11.535
Okay, so not exactly a hang, then.

22:11.560 --> 22:12.700
I don't know what's going on with him,

22:12.724 --> 22:14.652
but I know that something's
going on with him,

22:14.677 --> 22:16.271
and obviously you guys
have been spending

22:16.295 --> 22:18.348
a lot of time together
lately because of your dad.

22:18.373 --> 22:20.067
So has he said anything to you?

22:20.092 --> 22:22.910
Am I just being paranoid or is
there something deeper here?

22:22.935 --> 22:24.479
Lot of questions.

22:24.756 --> 22:26.645
I see why you're such a good lawyer.

22:26.670 --> 22:29.285
I've only lost one case.
And for what it's worth,

22:29.310 --> 22:31.770
that water supply was not that polluted.

22:31.795 --> 22:33.806
Okay. Well...

22:34.127 --> 22:37.356
I would love to help, but...
I've learned that I really

22:37.381 --> 22:40.226
shouldn't get involved in
other people's martial issues.

22:40.251 --> 22:41.801
So there is something wrong.

22:42.124 --> 22:43.465
Hmm.

22:45.482 --> 22:46.526
Okay, before you judge,

22:46.551 --> 22:48.301
just know that these tears

22:48.326 --> 22:49.937
are because I'm hormonal.

22:49.962 --> 22:51.825
My body is doing all sorts
of disgusting things to me,

22:51.849 --> 22:54.824
like making liquid appear in my eyes.

22:55.255 --> 22:56.863
Emily, I'm not judging.

22:56.888 --> 22:59.106
Please, Zoey,
can't you just give me a reason

22:59.131 --> 23:01.943
why he's doing this to me? To us?

23:01.968 --> 23:03.270
Is he having an affair?

23:03.295 --> 23:04.672
No!

23:05.290 --> 23:07.754
David isn't hiding something terrible.

23:07.779 --> 23:09.434
He's just...

23:11.095 --> 23:13.107
has the pre-baby jitters.

23:13.132 --> 23:14.496
That's all.

23:15.210 --> 23:17.231
What does that even mean?

23:17.256 --> 23:20.502
It means he's afraid of having a boy.

23:20.527 --> 23:23.172
But you can breathe a sigh of relief.

23:23.197 --> 23:24.551
Your husband's not a cheater.

23:24.576 --> 23:27.543
He's just delightfully neurotic. Yay!

23:27.568 --> 23:29.479
And all his late nights at work?

23:29.504 --> 23:33.801
That's just him going out with
some guys to blow off steam.

23:33.942 --> 23:39.543
Okay, so, neurotic and a teeny,
tiny little bit of a liar,

23:39.568 --> 23:42.871
but all for reasons that
made perfect sense to me.

23:46.955 --> 23:48.684
This is really lovely, by the way.

23:48.709 --> 23:51.043
We should come here more often.

23:53.628 --> 23:56.121
Hey, bro, so I just left your wife,

23:56.146 --> 23:59.152
and I maybe-sorta-kinda-might've
screwed up somehow.

23:59.177 --> 24:02.707
Give me a call so we can discuss it.
Thank you.

24:06.877 --> 24:12.426
♪ Well, everybody hurts ♪

24:12.451 --> 24:14.763
♪ Sometimes ♪

24:14.788 --> 24:20.191
♪ Everybody cries ♪

24:21.680 --> 24:26.574
♪ And everybody hurts ♪

24:26.903 --> 24:30.037

24:36.738 --> 24:38.082
I think we broke Leif.

24:38.107 --> 24:39.715
Well, it was only a matter of time.

24:39.740 --> 24:41.020
That review really wrecked him.

24:41.045 --> 24:43.496
Can we just tell him who wrote it?

24:43.521 --> 24:44.832
Have them talk it out?

24:44.857 --> 24:46.449
I think that would maybe help him.

24:46.474 --> 24:49.738
In theory, we can tell him,
but in actuality, no.

24:49.763 --> 24:52.418
- Why not?
- Because I wrote the review.

24:52.597 --> 24:54.934
Why would you write that?

24:54.959 --> 24:56.567
We both know he's a great programmer.

24:56.592 --> 24:58.146
Yes, but it doesn't mean
those other things

24:58.170 --> 24:59.648
I wrote weren't true.

24:59.673 --> 25:01.559
And it doesn't mean he
doesn't need to hear that

25:01.584 --> 25:03.199
to change his attitude around here.

25:03.224 --> 25:04.685
Well, I'm not really sure he did hear

25:04.709 --> 25:06.453
and/or take in what you said.

25:06.478 --> 25:07.555
He's just wallowing.

25:07.580 --> 25:09.692
That's why I never thought
an anonymous peer review

25:09.717 --> 25:10.910
was a very good idea.

25:10.935 --> 25:13.317
It's too gutless,
it's too passive-aggressive.

25:13.342 --> 25:14.801
I like aggressive-aggressive.

25:14.826 --> 25:16.341
Well, then why did you agree
with it in the first place?

25:16.365 --> 25:19.004
Because it was your idea.

25:19.029 --> 25:20.746
I don't wanna clip your wings.

25:20.771 --> 25:22.129
We have to do something.

25:22.154 --> 25:25.035
No, you have to do something.

25:25.060 --> 25:26.731
You're his manager now.

25:27.015 --> 25:29.515
Tough conversations are part of the job.

25:34.552 --> 25:36.090
Zoey, it's me.

25:37.772 --> 25:40.582
Hey. Uh, why did you tell
Emily about my fears

25:40.607 --> 25:42.895
about having a baby when I
specifically asked you not to?

25:42.920 --> 25:44.285
I didn't mean to, but she asked me

25:44.310 --> 25:45.857
what was going on with you,
and I tried to tell her

25:45.881 --> 25:48.340
it was between the two of you,
and that it wasn't a big deal.

25:48.365 --> 25:50.262
But she was very persuasive
and pregnant and...

25:50.287 --> 25:52.988
It's a very big deal, okay?

25:53.013 --> 25:55.028
When Emily and I got married,
she did not want to have kids,

25:55.052 --> 25:57.051
like, at all.

25:57.076 --> 25:58.551
I had to talk her into it.

25:58.576 --> 26:00.340
And I promised her that I would be

26:00.365 --> 26:02.262
100% committed to our children.

26:02.287 --> 26:05.934
But now that you have casually
revealed my deepest fears,

26:05.959 --> 26:07.520
she is completely freaked out

26:07.545 --> 26:09.660
and terrified that I am not all in.

26:09.875 --> 26:12.887
- David, I had no idea.
- Of course not.

26:12.912 --> 26:15.130
You have no idea because you're
not a part of my marriage.

26:15.154 --> 26:19.234
You don't know everything that's
going on in our heads, Zoey.

26:19.259 --> 26:22.832
Look, all right, all I wanted
was for Emily to experience

26:22.857 --> 26:24.340
a pregnancy with zero negativity.

26:24.365 --> 26:25.614
That is all. That's all I wanted.

26:25.638 --> 26:27.224
But you have just made
that completely impossible.

26:27.248 --> 26:29.035
- I was just trying to help.
- Oh, yeah?

26:29.060 --> 26:30.871
And you telling her where I actually am

26:30.896 --> 26:33.942
instead of coming home at night?
That was you helping, too?

26:33.967 --> 26:35.536
No, that was more of
a slip of the tongue.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.379
Okay, whatever. Look, you know,

26:37.404 --> 26:39.146
since you've always been
so results-oriented,

26:39.170 --> 26:42.199
I'm just gonna put it into words
that you can understand, okay?

26:42.224 --> 26:43.936
Whatever it is that you
thought you were doing

26:43.960 --> 26:46.402
to try to help me, or help us,

26:47.447 --> 26:49.418
you totally failed.

27:01.792 --> 27:03.893
The duet was a disaster.

27:03.918 --> 27:06.260
I didn't help either of them.
I just made things worse.

27:06.285 --> 27:08.379
What am I eating? This is so delicious.

27:08.404 --> 27:09.707
A pupusa.

27:09.732 --> 27:13.045
A friend of mine from
El Salvador made them

27:13.070 --> 27:14.922
before falling asleep in my bed...

27:15.129 --> 27:17.305
that he's currently still in.

27:18.456 --> 27:21.540
I just feel like I'm failing, hardcore,

27:21.565 --> 27:23.361
and I don't know if you got the memo,

27:23.386 --> 27:27.943
but Zoey Clarke is not a failure.

27:27.968 --> 27:30.132
Why do you put so much
pressure on yourself?

27:30.157 --> 27:31.602
Were your parents
hard on you as a child?

27:31.626 --> 27:33.338
Make you feel like you weren't
good enough or something?

27:33.362 --> 27:35.006
No, actually it was the opposite.

27:35.031 --> 27:36.766
They showered me with praise
for everything that I did.

27:36.790 --> 27:38.734
Which meant that I never
knew how I really was

27:38.759 --> 27:41.874
because I got no negative criticism.

27:41.899 --> 27:44.935
And so I had to prove to
myself that I was the best,

27:44.960 --> 27:48.053
to show I was as great as
they already thought I was.

27:48.077 --> 27:51.223
Wow. I just got a window into your soul,

27:51.247 --> 27:52.945
and, baby,
it's not a place I want to visit.

27:52.969 --> 27:54.892
I don't blame you.

27:54.917 --> 27:56.528
I get it.

27:56.772 --> 27:58.597
It's not easy, especially for someone

27:58.621 --> 28:00.897
who's had this certain
idea in their head

28:00.922 --> 28:02.399
for a very long time.

28:02.424 --> 28:03.903
But it seems to me that
you just need to change

28:03.927 --> 28:05.663
your relationship with failure.

28:05.688 --> 28:09.640
And I do that how exactly?

28:09.665 --> 28:15.054
Hm. Take my line of bespoke berets.

28:15.079 --> 28:17.827
I didn't sell not a damn
one of these online.

28:17.852 --> 28:19.522
- You know what happened?
- No.

28:19.547 --> 28:21.825
But I'm hoping this story ends in Paris.

28:21.850 --> 28:23.194
A designer saw them online

28:23.219 --> 28:25.468
and asked me to make
him a line of scarves,

28:25.493 --> 28:27.405
which he never paid me for.

28:27.430 --> 28:29.054
But because of him,

28:29.079 --> 28:30.862
I met another guy who commissioned me

28:30.887 --> 28:33.351
to make a series
of portraits of his mother.

28:33.376 --> 28:34.376
Weird.

28:34.401 --> 28:37.358
But more lucrative than these berets.

28:37.383 --> 28:38.851
You'll get better at this.

28:38.876 --> 28:41.639
As long as you see every
failure not as defeat

28:41.664 --> 28:45.843
but as a stepping stone
on the road to success.

28:45.868 --> 28:47.167
Hmm?

28:47.851 --> 28:49.395
Try this on.

28:49.841 --> 28:51.916
Oh, you look cute in a beret.

28:51.941 --> 28:54.218
Yeah, I wouldn't have
bought one of these either.

28:54.243 --> 28:56.276
Then I'm not gonna give you one.

28:57.362 --> 28:59.694
So, first, I think,
we go in a cable car.

28:59.719 --> 29:01.358
- Mm-hmm.
- Then we got to Rose's Cafe,

29:01.383 --> 29:03.061
and then I thought we'd go to Alcatraz.

29:03.086 --> 29:04.397
My dad served a short prison stint,

29:04.421 --> 29:05.711
and I thought it'd be funny, you know,

29:05.735 --> 29:06.883
if we went to a prison

29:06.908 --> 29:10.594
- with him in San Francisco.
- Can we stop... stop for a second?

29:10.898 --> 29:14.242
I'm just more of a
weightlifter than a cardio guy.

29:14.267 --> 29:17.125
Oh, come on, Max! This is good for you!

29:17.150 --> 29:19.028
Breathing in the cool morning air,

29:19.053 --> 29:20.399
appreciating nature.

29:20.424 --> 29:22.135
Did you know I once stared at the ocean

29:22.160 --> 29:24.727
- for literally seven hours?
- We should break up.

29:25.345 --> 29:27.000
Wait, what?

29:27.777 --> 29:30.489
I just think we're looking
for different things.

29:30.513 --> 29:33.841
Look, you're all about
the journey, right?

29:34.483 --> 29:36.333
Maybe our journey was supposed to be

29:36.358 --> 29:38.435
this short, awesome side path

29:38.460 --> 29:41.107
that leads us to the next great thing.

29:43.954 --> 29:45.685
Do you hate me?

29:47.589 --> 29:49.622
The opposite.

29:51.788 --> 29:54.489
I appreciate your truth.

29:55.136 --> 29:58.076
You need to do what's
right for you up in here...

29:58.101 --> 29:59.826
and here.

30:01.070 --> 30:03.419
How could I be mad about that?

30:03.852 --> 30:06.779
Thank you for being so understanding.

30:09.983 --> 30:11.394
Okay, now this is awkward.

30:11.419 --> 30:13.163
Do we run together or
do we go separately?

30:13.188 --> 30:14.647
'Cause you still have stuff at my place.

30:14.671 --> 30:16.649
Right. How about you lead the way,

30:16.674 --> 30:17.985
and I'll just...

30:18.010 --> 30:20.355
holler if I need any medical assistance?

30:20.863 --> 30:23.123
Okay.

30:28.528 --> 30:30.755
Hey. Just checking in.

30:33.683 --> 30:35.360
You good?

30:35.571 --> 30:36.966
I'm good.

30:36.991 --> 30:38.716
'Cause I know what today is.

30:39.578 --> 30:41.892
You'd tell me if
you weren't good, right?

30:41.917 --> 30:44.027
I haven't even cracked open the tequila

30:44.052 --> 30:45.216
from your grief kit yet.

30:45.241 --> 30:46.647
You do have the hammer in your hand.

30:46.671 --> 30:48.404
- Facts.
- Okay.

30:48.429 --> 30:50.044
If you need me...

30:53.117 --> 30:55.505
- 50 feet that way.
- 50 feet that way.

31:03.005 --> 31:05.949
So, I asked Joan for
all my peer reviews,

31:05.974 --> 31:07.451
and she sent them to me.

31:07.794 --> 31:13.136
She said there were some
not-so-nice ones in here.

31:13.208 --> 31:14.996
Let's read them together.

31:15.649 --> 31:17.769
Ready? Zoey...

31:17.794 --> 31:19.572
"Stammers too much".

31:19.597 --> 31:20.972
"Lacks confidence."

31:20.997 --> 31:25.394
"Wears too many sweaters
over collared shirts."

31:25.877 --> 31:29.558
Not sure how that one is
quite performance-related.

31:29.878 --> 31:32.167
"Can't delegate." "Tries too hard."

31:32.192 --> 31:34.605
"I deserved the promotion, not her."

31:35.785 --> 31:36.808
I wrote that one.

31:36.833 --> 31:38.589
I'm shocked.

31:39.156 --> 31:42.445
Look, reading these
comments hurts, a lot.

31:42.470 --> 31:43.980
Very deeply.

31:44.005 --> 31:46.250
Quite a bit more than I
was expecting them to.

31:46.522 --> 31:48.741
But once we've taken in that criticism,

31:48.766 --> 31:51.171
it's all about how we pick ourselves up

31:51.196 --> 31:52.851
and bounce right back.

31:52.876 --> 31:55.421
Bounce back? From being "smug,

31:55.446 --> 31:58.325
"and self-righteous, overly ambitious,

31:58.350 --> 32:00.462
more alienating than endearing?"

32:00.487 --> 32:02.098
Should I have a brain transplant?

32:02.123 --> 32:05.038
No. I think you need to take the note.

32:06.302 --> 32:07.452
And be better.

32:07.477 --> 32:09.781
- So you agree with it?
- I think they're not wrong!

32:09.806 --> 32:12.551
I think that sometimes you're
willfully disrespectful to me.

32:12.576 --> 32:14.773
You have this "all I do is win" attitude

32:14.798 --> 32:16.484
dancing around your head at all times

32:16.509 --> 32:18.781
whether you like to admit it or not.

32:18.806 --> 32:21.165
And it doesn't make you
a team player, Leif.

32:23.146 --> 32:26.517
Thank you for finally admitting

32:26.542 --> 32:28.947
that it was you who wrote the review.

32:29.450 --> 32:32.189
- Wait. What? No. That's completely...
- No, I get it,

32:32.214 --> 32:33.994
- and it actually helps me to know...
- No, no.

32:34.018 --> 32:35.392
exactly where you stand.

32:35.417 --> 32:37.837
You are 100% missing the point.

32:37.862 --> 32:40.236
No, no. Message received.

32:41.361 --> 32:42.759
Okay.

32:47.003 --> 32:48.978
So, tell me some good news, please?

32:49.003 --> 32:51.781
Are you gonna take that
gig at the big old mansion?

32:51.806 --> 32:54.306
I was thinking that
might be fun for you.

32:54.933 --> 32:58.259
I love my work, you know that, but...

32:58.740 --> 33:01.719
it's always been a partnership
between your dad and me,

33:01.744 --> 33:05.837
and the more I think about it,
the more I just...

33:06.083 --> 33:08.228
can't picture doing it without him.

33:08.253 --> 33:10.064
So, no, I'm not gonna take the job,

33:10.089 --> 33:12.548
and I'm shutting down the business.

33:12.847 --> 33:15.165
You're shutting down the business?

33:16.033 --> 33:17.618
How can I keep going?

33:17.643 --> 33:21.400
I mean, all this time,
it's always been the two of us.

33:21.425 --> 33:25.298
And what, I'm supposed
to just forge on alone?

33:25.323 --> 33:28.533
That seems so heartless.

34:41.656 --> 34:44.783
I'm guessing you haven't
talked to him about this yet.

34:45.016 --> 34:47.235
No. I mean, he might have heard me

34:47.261 --> 34:49.891
talking about it a little. Why?

34:51.447 --> 34:54.728
This is your thing,

34:54.753 --> 34:56.377
and I think if you told
him you were going

34:56.400 --> 34:59.837
to keep the business going,
he'd be dancing with joy.

35:13.284 --> 35:15.564
- Hello?
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

35:17.874 --> 35:20.329
Truly. I...

35:20.587 --> 35:25.259
I didn't know what I was
walking into with Emily, but...

35:27.048 --> 35:29.798
- We need to move past this. I was...
- I appreciate the call.

35:30.790 --> 35:35.289
Um, I... I need a...
I need a break, though.

35:35.314 --> 35:38.626
I need a little time to
get my head straight and...

35:39.418 --> 35:41.997
try to just let this whole thing go.

35:42.021 --> 35:44.572
But I'll reach out when I'm ready, okay?

35:44.597 --> 35:46.837
<i>I love you, and I'll talk to you soon.</i>

35:49.480 --> 35:53.314
Just so we're clear, I'm doing this.

36:08.681 --> 36:10.353
Really? Are you sure?

36:10.378 --> 36:13.892
Because I don't have to.

36:13.917 --> 36:15.493
So...

36:16.920 --> 36:19.900
buzz now or forever hold your peace.

36:41.582 --> 36:42.980
Okay.

36:45.938 --> 36:48.681
Hey, Linda. Hi.

36:48.706 --> 36:51.051
It's... it's Maggie Clarke.

36:51.076 --> 36:53.150
Hi. Yeah, I've been thinking,

36:53.175 --> 36:57.579
and I would like to help
you with your project.

37:07.797 --> 37:09.423
- Hello?
- <i>Hey.</i>

37:09.448 --> 37:11.259
<i>Whoa, what happened to your face?</i>

37:11.284 --> 37:13.253
Mo says that my pores are screaming out

37:13.278 --> 37:14.353
for love and attention,

37:14.378 --> 37:17.079
so she's making me look
like a horror villain.

37:17.104 --> 37:20.711
<i>I don't mind it. So, I, uh,
decided to take some initiative...</i>

37:20.736 --> 37:22.579
_

37:23.262 --> 37:25.103
<i>... and I broke up with Autumn.</i>

37:26.630 --> 37:31.299
Um, Max, um...
I hate to say this... Uh...

37:34.231 --> 37:36.564
I feel terrible, but, um,
I have to call you back.

37:36.589 --> 37:38.291
<i>What? Oh, okay. Bye.</i>

37:39.886 --> 37:41.243
Just a minute!

37:51.522 --> 37:53.439
- Hi.
- Sorry, I know it's late.

37:53.464 --> 37:56.291
I just needed to talk through
something with somebody.

37:56.316 --> 37:57.744
With you.

37:57.769 --> 38:00.025
Of course. Uh, come in.

38:00.720 --> 38:02.220
- Um...
- What's wrong?

38:02.245 --> 38:04.409
I was going through some old
emails between me and my dad,

38:04.433 --> 38:05.994
just normal everyday stuff.

38:06.019 --> 38:07.759
A diner opened up down the street.

38:07.784 --> 38:09.549
The fantasy football draft.

38:09.964 --> 38:13.525
But there was this moment
where his whole tenor changed.

38:16.199 --> 38:20.424
It's like a bleakness,
or something took over,

38:20.728 --> 38:22.772
that I completely missed at the time.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.509
I'll show you.

38:24.935 --> 38:28.142
It's, uh, right here.
Pulled it up a second ago.

38:28.167 --> 38:29.713
I just...

38:31.402 --> 38:34.369
Could I have stopped him
from going through with it?

38:36.134 --> 38:37.711
Did I...

38:41.478 --> 38:45.533
Did I fail him when he
needed me the most?

38:50.510 --> 38:52.174
Simon,

38:52.847 --> 38:54.588
it's...

38:58.285 --> 39:01.189
... entirely possible

39:01.214 --> 39:03.845
that you failed to see the signs
that your dad was in trouble.

39:03.870 --> 39:07.049
I know. That's what I think, too.

39:12.112 --> 39:13.812
But maybe...

39:17.261 --> 39:19.033
... there's nothing more
you could have done

39:19.058 --> 39:21.744
because your dad didn't want
or wasn't open to your help.

39:26.532 --> 39:28.463
It's hard to admit...

39:29.691 --> 39:32.611
that we fail sometimes, but, um...

39:33.656 --> 39:35.181
it's true.

39:35.523 --> 39:37.267
And...

39:38.705 --> 39:42.541
you know, we don't know
what was going on in his head.

39:44.611 --> 39:46.924
And, you, living with all this,

39:46.949 --> 39:50.525
carrying some...

39:51.124 --> 39:53.252
vague guilt...

39:53.522 --> 39:57.150
doesn't help you move forward.

40:03.674 --> 40:05.486
Thank you.

40:06.328 --> 40:09.666
For the worst pep talk ever?

40:11.136 --> 40:12.436
It was bad.

40:12.461 --> 40:15.941
Yeah, it was actually...

40:16.115 --> 40:17.845
pretty great.

40:18.673 --> 40:21.516
But thank you for not trying to fix me,

40:22.283 --> 40:23.666
or make me feel better.

40:23.691 --> 40:26.025
Thanks for just being...

40:27.351 --> 40:29.095
real.

40:29.687 --> 40:31.291
Any time.

40:45.627 --> 40:46.728
