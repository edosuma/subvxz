00:55.420 --> 00:57.454
 Oh, great spirit of Halloween.

01:01.391 --> 01:02.924
   I just really wanna know,

01:04.525 --> 01:06.126
 why is Robert not calling me?

01:22.442 --> 01:23.608
- Asshole.

02:17.057 --> 02:18.123
           Hey, Beth.

02:19.592 --> 02:20.858
       No, no, I'm fine.

02:21.159 --> 02:23.693
   I just saw a guy standing
       across the street,

02:24.327 --> 02:25.860
   just staring at me, yeah,
     it was really creepy.

02:29.331 --> 02:30.497
     I'm sure it's nothing.

02:31.665 --> 02:33.966
    No, no, I haven't heard
     from Robert all night.

02:36.635 --> 02:38.335
       Beth, let me call
        you right back,

02:38.337 --> 02:39.502
I think someone is at the door.

03:13.436 --> 03:14.536
             Hello?

03:48.135 --> 03:49.201
           Hey, Beth.

03:50.703 --> 03:51.803
             Yeah.

03:53.806 --> 03:57.140
      Some creepy guy left
       a VHS at my door.

03:58.408 --> 03:59.641
         Yeah, a tape.

04:02.144 --> 04:04.512
         I don't know,
     some trick-or-treater

04:04.514 --> 04:05.713
   with nothing better to do.

04:06.715 --> 04:08.749
        Are you kidding,
    of course I have a VCR.

04:10.218 --> 04:12.252
    You know how much better
   <i> Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>

04:12.254 --> 04:13.920
   looks on VHS than Blu-ray?

04:14.554 --> 04:16.786
       No, Blu-ray makes
     everything look fake.

04:18.356 --> 04:20.656
     Okay, well, have fun.

04:21.492 --> 04:22.558
   I'll talk to you tomorrow.

04:22.560 --> 04:23.659
           Okay, bye.

04:55.588 --> 04:57.288
When I was a little girl,
           we used to

04:57.290 --> 04:59.156
plant pumpkins in our backyard.

04:59.624 --> 05:01.257
Did they have
      pumpkins back then?

05:01.524 --> 05:02.891
Yeah,
      and they didn't cost

05:02.893 --> 05:04.692
   25 fucking dollars either.

05:04.959 --> 05:06.292
Fucking!

05:06.294 --> 05:07.660
         When can we go
       trick-or-treating?

05:07.861 --> 05:09.428
    Don't you wanna make our
     jack-o'-lantern first?

05:09.595 --> 05:10.661
            Why?

05:11.095 --> 05:12.195
      So we can put it out
    here on the front steps.

05:31.281 --> 05:34.049
  Pumpkin soup, pumpkin bread,

05:34.051 --> 05:35.316
         pumpkin pie...

05:35.817 --> 05:38.451
  Maybe your mom can make you
   pumpkin pancakes tomorrow.

05:41.253 --> 05:42.686
 Why don't you take one of your
   crayons and draw the face?

05:46.289 --> 05:47.489
           You do it.

05:48.390 --> 05:49.957
   Do you want a happy face?

05:50.792 --> 05:51.892
         A scary face?

05:51.894 --> 05:53.093
          Scary face!

05:53.095 --> 05:54.193
Excellent.

05:57.096 --> 05:58.963
   So what we're gonna first,

05:58.965 --> 06:00.764
   is cut a hole in the top.

06:00.766 --> 06:01.998
              Why?

06:02.466 --> 06:04.966
        So we can scoop
        out the insides.

06:06.568 --> 06:07.834
Like brains?

06:07.836 --> 06:09.235
       Yes, like brains.

06:10.403 --> 06:11.802
     Speaking of brains...

06:14.505 --> 06:16.806
      Looks like Elliott's
      working late again.

06:20.910 --> 06:22.677
When's
       Daddy coming over?

06:23.178 --> 06:25.179
       Well, it better be
     in the next 15 minutes

06:25.181 --> 06:27.413
       or somebody is not
   having a happy Halloween.

06:30.183 --> 06:31.917
    Can pumpkins feel pain?

06:33.019 --> 06:34.185
         Of course not.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.587
 Like that lobster my dad threw

06:37.589 --> 06:39.555
in the boiling water that time?

06:40.023 --> 06:41.423
          It screamed.

06:42.291 --> 06:45.025
     Okay, so why don't you
     scoop out the insides?

06:47.928 --> 06:49.128
             Gross!

06:49.130 --> 06:50.295
You want me to do it?

06:50.297 --> 06:51.996
              -No.
             -Okay.

06:57.101 --> 06:58.434
  So while you are doing that,

06:58.436 --> 07:00.335
   I will separate the seeds.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.502
Why?

07:01.504 --> 07:02.736
      So we can cook them.

07:06.473 --> 07:08.040
            Brains.

07:08.674 --> 07:10.408
    Good, now for the face.

07:11.943 --> 07:13.076
       Watch your hands.

07:34.698 --> 07:36.198
 Is that scary enough for you?

07:36.200 --> 07:37.365
              Wow!

07:37.367 --> 07:38.733
Good.

07:40.535 --> 07:42.168
 Okay, so why don't you grab me

07:42.170 --> 07:43.435
    that candle over there?

07:48.006 --> 07:49.106
           All right.

08:01.485 --> 08:02.651
            <i> Voila.</i>

08:20.369 --> 08:22.001
<i> Hey, guys,</i>
       <i> you got Elliott,</i>

08:22.003 --> 08:23.268
      <i> I can't take your</i>
     <i> phone call right now</i>

08:23.270 --> 08:25.069
     <i> for whatever reason,</i>

08:25.337 --> 08:26.970
     <i> but you already know</i>
  <i> what to do with the beep,</i>

08:26.972 --> 08:28.972
 <i> baby-boo, happy Halloweener.</i>

08:30.474 --> 08:33.042
Do you think I'm stupid?

08:33.809 --> 08:35.544
Don't even bother coming over.

08:36.279 --> 08:38.546
   And tell Angie Del-Frisco
          I said, hi.

08:40.048 --> 08:41.381
Close your eyes.

08:41.383 --> 08:43.515
They're closed.

08:44.017 --> 08:45.384
Okay, now!

08:49.021 --> 08:50.321
              Oh!

08:50.323 --> 08:52.289
  It's supposed to scare you!

08:52.623 --> 08:53.923
I'm terrified.

08:54.157 --> 08:55.357
  Do you want a pumpkin seed?

08:59.861 --> 09:01.294
   Don't, honey, he'll choke.

09:11.669 --> 09:13.603
          Here, here.

09:15.504 --> 09:18.606
      Okay, cough, cough!

09:18.907 --> 09:19.973
          Jack, cough!

09:30.482 --> 09:35.552
- Jack?

09:41.224 --> 09:43.892
All right, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

09:43.894 --> 09:45.627
     I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

09:49.330 --> 09:51.564
   Your mom is gonna kill me.

09:52.098 --> 09:53.465
             Okay.

09:53.899 --> 09:55.632
--Shut up, Oscar!

09:58.235 --> 09:59.468
             Okay.

10:02.372 --> 10:03.604
          What the...?

10:05.239 --> 10:06.305
             Jack?

10:08.574 --> 10:09.774
             Okay.

10:10.776 --> 10:11.842
             Okay.

10:20.851 --> 10:23.152
      Okay, breathe, Jack.

11:04.388 --> 11:05.453
Jack!

11:54.760 --> 11:56.093
Trick or treat!

12:07.269 --> 12:08.602
      Ho, excuse me buddy.

12:20.614 --> 12:21.947
        Hello beautiful!

12:22.715 --> 12:23.781
            <i> Lizzy?</i>

12:25.984 --> 12:27.084
            <i> Lizzy?</i>

13:04.752 --> 13:06.918
Easy, girl!

13:08.587 --> 13:09.787
Trick or treat.

13:13.523 --> 13:14.656
          Stay there.

13:22.396 --> 13:23.662
   You be careful out there.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.092
         Knock, knock,
      knock, knock, knock

13:56.094 --> 13:57.159
          Who's there?

13:57.426 --> 14:00.161
         Sam and Janet,
       Sam and Janet who?

14:00.562 --> 14:01.695
        Trick or treat?

14:02.196 --> 14:05.497
    Aren't you all a little
   late to be out this young?

14:06.398 --> 14:08.365
       Especially with...

14:13.135 --> 14:18.105
       Shh, I'll see what
        I can find, shh!

14:26.745 --> 14:28.712
   It's not much, I'm afraid.

14:29.113 --> 14:31.080
       You should manage
       more than anyone,

14:31.082 --> 14:32.181
       you're the devil.

14:32.482 --> 14:36.785
      Lucifer, Beelzebub,
        the Horned One.

15:41.979 --> 15:43.112
           <i> Go away.</i>

15:47.349 --> 15:48.515
       <i> Trick or treat.</i>

15:48.949 --> 15:50.416
  You've got to be kidding me.

16:07.066 --> 16:09.633
           <i> Go home,</i>
<i> there's nothing for you here.</i>

16:11.069 --> 16:12.502
 <i> Do kids even know Halloween?</i>

16:14.304 --> 16:16.204
      <i> Bad things happen</i>
       <i> to trespassers.</i>

16:29.784 --> 16:31.584
      Kate, get down here!

16:36.255 --> 16:37.488
       <i> Trick or treat.</i>

16:42.926 --> 16:45.928
         I said scram,
 don't make me come out there,

16:45.930 --> 16:48.063
     go bother someone else
      and leave us alone.

16:48.330 --> 16:50.331
<i>Now get the hell of my property!</i>

16:57.304 --> 16:58.537
      Jack, they're kids.

16:59.372 --> 17:00.438
     Maybe we should let...

17:02.107 --> 17:03.239
I think
        they're leaving.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.242
What if
      they need our help?

17:38.035 --> 17:40.236
      Kate, it's not safe,

17:40.238 --> 17:42.571
     we can't just open the
    door for anyone anymore.

17:42.573 --> 17:43.738
         They're kids.

17:44.206 --> 17:45.806
They're hungry, we have enough.

17:45.808 --> 17:48.141
         No, we're not
 taking that chance, not again!

17:48.742 --> 17:50.909
    They could be infected,
      they could be crazy

17:50.911 --> 17:52.210
    for all we know, I mean,

17:52.212 --> 17:53.778
   they think it's Halloween!

17:55.480 --> 17:57.047
    I think it is Halloween.

17:58.149 --> 18:00.150
        They're getting
     nothing from us, Kate.

18:01.218 --> 18:02.751
 We have to protect ourselves.

18:02.753 --> 18:03.885
           From what?

18:04.887 --> 18:05.953
             This?

18:21.903 --> 18:23.103
  Everything is gonna be okay.

18:34.848 --> 18:36.014
     I guess they're gone.

18:36.016 --> 18:37.148
   I don't see them anymore.

18:38.885 --> 18:39.984
             Good.

18:40.719 --> 18:42.319
Let them go harass someone else.

18:44.789 --> 18:45.855
             Honey?

18:53.563 --> 18:54.796
             Kate?

19:01.735 --> 19:03.335
Jack!

19:04.770 --> 19:07.037
          Kate, Kate!

19:07.039 --> 19:08.204
Kate.

19:13.076 --> 19:14.476
             Jack.

19:33.429 --> 19:34.828
        Where's my wife,

19:34.830 --> 19:36.529
 what did you do with my wife?

19:37.397 --> 19:38.797
    What do you want, food?

19:39.565 --> 19:42.400
            Take it,
   just take it and get out.

19:42.402 --> 19:45.503
It's too late, Jack.

20:05.423 --> 20:07.257
It's too late, Jack.

20:11.996 --> 20:13.462
      It's too late, Jack.

20:19.034 --> 20:20.834
        Too late, Jack.

20:57.838 --> 20:59.605
          Kate, Kate!

21:30.264 --> 21:31.797
Happy Halloween.

22:45.064 --> 22:46.998
          Hey, relax.

22:48.467 --> 22:50.334
       It always happens
      this way, remember.

22:51.502 --> 22:53.336
        It's not exactly
     something you forget.

23:07.683 --> 23:08.749
           That's it.

23:10.985 --> 23:12.251
            So, go.

23:39.445 --> 23:40.878
    It's looking good, Dad.

23:49.687 --> 23:50.753
         It's not here.

23:51.020 --> 23:52.754
             -What?
           -The meat.

23:54.389 --> 23:56.356
         It has to be,
     you grabbed it, right?

23:56.358 --> 23:57.657
         I don't know,
        I thought I did,

23:57.659 --> 23:59.058
       it was right there
         on the table.

23:59.060 --> 24:00.159
  Well, did you or didn't you?

24:00.161 --> 24:01.593
        I thought I did!

24:05.330 --> 24:07.798
        Christ, you said
       you had the meat!

24:07.800 --> 24:08.899
  I don't know, I don't know,

24:08.901 --> 24:10.700
  I was scared, I was rushing.

24:10.702 --> 24:11.901
         Unbelievable!

24:16.338 --> 24:17.538
          We're fine.

24:18.473 --> 24:19.772
     We'll figure this out.

24:22.408 --> 24:24.609
         We're fucked.

24:33.216 --> 24:34.616
  You've got to go out there.

24:36.985 --> 24:39.419
    It's been years, Isaac,
 he won't listen to me anymore,

24:39.421 --> 24:41.854
      he'll listen to you,
   you haven't missed a year.

24:41.856 --> 24:44.056
    But this is your fault.

24:44.058 --> 24:46.658
    -This is your offering!
            -I know.

24:51.763 --> 24:52.929
            Please.

25:03.539 --> 25:04.839
        Be ready to go.

25:14.349 --> 25:15.448
Son...

25:17.951 --> 25:19.084
           thank you.

25:30.429 --> 25:31.495
<i> It's me!</i>

25:35.001 --> 25:36.367
       My father's here.

25:37.736 --> 25:39.303
     But he made a mistake.

25:46.477 --> 25:47.810
        There's no meat.

25:50.080 --> 25:52.246
It's a mistake,
          we're sorry.

25:53.748 --> 25:55.482
 We'll bring double next time.

25:59.386 --> 26:01.920
 Please, just take what's here.

26:04.224 --> 26:05.323
Please!

26:31.747 --> 26:32.812
          Oh, my God.

26:36.682 --> 26:37.748
Forgive me.

26:41.886 --> 26:44.554
         Open the door,
     open the fucking door!

26:44.556 --> 26:46.289
        -It won't open.
       -What do you mean?

26:46.291 --> 26:47.790
It's jammed or something.

26:49.192 --> 26:50.959
       For Christ's sake,
         Dad, the door!

26:55.531 --> 26:56.797
             Dad...

27:00.534 --> 27:02.034
  He's coming soon, isn't he?

29:31.679 --> 29:33.178
<i> Hi,</i>
       <i> this is Vanessa,</i>

29:33.512 --> 29:35.379
   <i> I'm not home right now,</i>
<i>leave a message after the beep.</i>

29:35.381 --> 29:38.948
--Vanessa, hello?

29:41.451 --> 29:44.219
      I've been sitting at
      JB's for 45 minutes

29:44.221 --> 29:47.455
       getting hit on by
     the dregs of humanity

29:47.457 --> 29:49.122
        and your ass is
      nowhere to be seen.

29:51.792 --> 29:53.425
- Hello?

30:15.908 --> 30:17.041
            Vanessa?

35:07.884 --> 35:09.251
            Oh, hey.

35:12.254 --> 35:14.822
    I, uh, was just about to
    take those stairs again.

35:24.431 --> 35:25.697
        Looks like we're
       the last ones, eh?

35:25.699 --> 35:27.031
       Yeah, I think so,

35:27.033 --> 35:28.232
      but I didn't realize
        it was so late.

35:28.866 --> 35:30.233
Oh, yeah, well at least
we're getting out of here.

35:30.834 --> 35:32.467
     Looks like I'm pulling
        an all-nighter.

36:56.679 --> 36:58.513
           Goddammit.

36:59.181 --> 37:00.581
     These fucking things.

37:06.987 --> 37:08.520
I don't think that's gonna help.

37:12.457 --> 37:13.757
      Just your luck, huh?

37:22.599 --> 37:23.731
         Are you okay?

37:26.501 --> 37:27.734
    Are you claustrophobic?

37:31.371 --> 37:32.537
          Don't worry.

37:33.539 --> 37:35.106
     There's plenty of room
      in here to breathe.

37:36.975 --> 37:38.208
         We'll be fine.

37:40.211 --> 37:41.844
      I mean this happened
        just last month,

37:41.846 --> 37:44.512
   just give it a second and
    it should reset itself.

37:53.854 --> 37:55.688
   I think it might be a good
     idea if you sit down.

38:05.563 --> 38:07.897
       Is there something
       I can do to help?

38:08.498 --> 38:10.398
    No, no, I'll be fine.

38:23.178 --> 38:25.411
   Well, I guess we're stuck
  here until it resets itself.

38:27.580 --> 38:29.080
  Or until somebody finds us.

39:07.017 --> 39:09.018
       Sorry, bad habit.

39:18.695 --> 39:20.461
  You're up on 26 aren't you?

39:22.931 --> 39:24.998
      Yeah, I'm sure I've
        seen you before.

39:32.238 --> 39:34.439
   It's a shame what happened
  to that girl from up there.

39:41.780 --> 39:42.880
            Too bad.

40:03.901 --> 40:05.067
             Hey...

40:58.917 --> 41:01.718
    Don't you fucking move,
         lock it down.

41:32.349 --> 41:33.549
             Jesus.

41:50.865 --> 41:54.033
        All right, Sam,
  how did you get out of that?

41:54.035 --> 41:55.834
     It's too early for my
   dad to close his bar tab.

41:57.202 --> 41:58.368
          Hey, Wheezy,
     you're wheezing again.

41:58.869 --> 42:00.703
    Yeah, forgot my inhaler.

42:00.705 --> 42:02.738
       Wow, what's this?

42:03.706 --> 42:06.340
 Step right up, step right up!

42:06.342 --> 42:10.210
          For the one,
      the only, Masochist!

42:12.111 --> 42:16.280
     Relieve that tension,
   take out that aggression,

42:16.282 --> 42:21.184
 in a game so cruel it's cool.

42:21.618 --> 42:24.019
    Give him what he wants,

42:24.021 --> 42:26.087
       get what you want.

42:26.354 --> 42:27.687
      What are the rules?

42:28.555 --> 42:31.123
     Use anything you see,

42:31.125 --> 42:34.559
       to make him bleed.

42:34.561 --> 42:36.060
       Get enough blood,

42:36.227 --> 42:38.127
      win yourself a bud.

42:38.129 --> 42:39.261
      I'll give it a shot.

42:40.062 --> 42:41.796
      You may be a winner

42:41.798 --> 42:43.898
  by giving it to this sinner,

42:43.900 --> 42:46.400
      take your pick, son,
        take your pick.

42:46.968 --> 42:48.001
           This one.

42:48.003 --> 42:52.738
     Ah, pins for the sins.

42:55.141 --> 42:57.108
         How about you?

42:57.909 --> 42:59.242
No thanks.

42:59.244 --> 43:01.544
          Jesus, Sam,
    stop being such a puss.

43:02.546 --> 43:03.712
          I'll do it.

43:03.714 --> 43:05.980
        Take your pick,
        take your pick.

43:07.048 --> 43:08.314
             These.

43:08.915 --> 43:12.083
       You can cross this
      off your wish list.

43:12.918 --> 43:16.086
Now, give it to this masochist!

43:21.992 --> 43:23.758
<i> Thanks,</i>
        <i> I needed that.</i>

43:27.662 --> 43:30.162
<i> Now I'm getting ticklish.</i>

43:31.164 --> 43:32.230
              Sam!

43:32.664 --> 43:34.665
        Oh, my God, Dad!

43:34.667 --> 43:36.199
         Sam, come on,

43:36.201 --> 43:37.667
     help me get these off,
      get me off of here!

43:37.669 --> 43:39.235
- Give him what he wants.
- Sam!

43:41.271 --> 43:42.738
       Get what you want.

43:50.045 --> 43:51.578
       You can win, Sam.

43:51.580 --> 43:53.512
Come on,
  help me, get me off of here!

43:55.781 --> 43:58.115
         Looks like we
       may have a winner,

43:58.117 --> 44:00.250
- if he gives it to
No, Sam, don't do it!

44:00.252 --> 44:01.484
- this sinner!
- Sam, stop!

44:06.623 --> 44:08.022
        Sam, just stop!

44:08.456 --> 44:10.857
    Ah, stop, stop it, Sam!

44:14.462 --> 44:15.794
        Sam, just stop!

44:15.796 --> 44:17.262
        Quit crying like
      a little girl, Dad.

44:17.429 --> 44:18.629
      Where's your balls?

44:18.631 --> 44:20.864
Stop, Sam,
        I'm sorry, Sam--

44:27.536 --> 44:29.570
      Sam, Sam, I'm sorry!

44:30.973 --> 44:33.106
           Sam, Sam!

44:39.879 --> 44:41.279
     Step right up, folks,

44:41.281 --> 44:44.314
        a game so cruel

44:45.149 --> 44:46.849
           it's cool.

46:27.345 --> 46:28.611
              Max?

46:30.847 --> 46:32.614
   You can't keep doing this.

46:38.353 --> 46:40.420
There's nothing to be scared of.

46:43.557 --> 46:44.924
        Go back to bed.

46:49.595 --> 46:50.995
       Come on, jump up.

46:55.767 --> 46:56.933
             Empty.

47:03.105 --> 47:05.005
     Messy, but no monster!

47:05.906 --> 47:07.907
        -Come on.
      -It ate my slipper.

47:07.909 --> 47:09.942
Monsters don't
      eat slippers, under.

47:09.944 --> 47:11.376
     What about the noise?

47:11.378 --> 47:14.112
Baby, it's just the wind.

47:14.114 --> 47:16.047
        The entire house
        has been sprayed

47:16.049 --> 47:18.482
       and inspected for
    anything bad, I promise.

47:19.116 --> 47:21.283
     What happens when you
      throw water on them?

47:21.450 --> 47:23.083
Monsters hate water.

47:33.359 --> 47:35.293
      What did I say about
      playing with those?

47:35.295 --> 47:37.528
            -Not to.
           -Give 'em.

47:48.939 --> 47:50.873
       I'm gonna put this
       right here, okay?

47:57.413 --> 47:58.946
     Just close your eyes.

48:00.214 --> 48:02.548
And think happy, happy thoughts.

48:03.650 --> 48:05.384
    And when you wake
      up it'll be morning.

48:06.452 --> 48:07.652
          Good night.

48:16.227 --> 48:17.627
      Don't shut the door.

50:41.566 --> 50:42.732
Max?

50:45.836 --> 50:48.070
    Max were you playing in
     the guest room again?

50:48.072 --> 50:49.371
No.

50:49.839 --> 50:51.806
      Really, then what's
    around your neck?

51:09.491 --> 51:11.258
         Mrs. Lieberman
      called this morning,

51:11.525 --> 51:13.158
        she said you're
     telling stories again.

51:14.593 --> 51:16.160
    Max, please look at me.

51:18.730 --> 51:21.364
  You're giving Little Scotty
   Michaels nightmares again.

51:21.366 --> 51:23.199
   He's afraid of everything,

51:23.201 --> 51:25.434
     he doesn't play in the
  sandbox because he's afraid

51:25.436 --> 51:26.835
  the worms are gonna eat him.

51:26.837 --> 51:28.837
       Well, that doesn't
    make it any less scary,

51:28.839 --> 51:30.738
       he's still afraid
     like you are at night.

51:30.740 --> 51:32.172
       It's not the same.

51:32.606 --> 51:34.506
      Well, how's it like?

51:35.407 --> 51:36.640
              Max?

51:45.048 --> 51:46.281
         You know, um,

51:46.582 --> 51:48.249
when you were still in diapers,

51:48.583 --> 51:50.951
        we lived in this
      100-year-old cabin,

51:51.252 --> 51:52.852
       you should've seen
        this place, Max.

51:53.186 --> 51:55.420
     It was very different
     from anything I knew.

51:55.422 --> 51:57.255
 And on one really windy night,

51:57.257 --> 51:58.689
    I put you down to sleep,

51:59.057 --> 52:01.691
   and I heard these noises.

52:02.225 --> 52:03.892
 Coming from outside the house

52:03.894 --> 52:05.493
   and I got a little scared.

52:06.094 --> 52:07.761
     So I checked that all
    the doors were locked,

52:07.763 --> 52:08.862
  and then I called your dad,

52:08.864 --> 52:09.963
     but he didn't pick up.

52:10.564 --> 52:14.033
       I lied in bed and
    I tried closing my eyes,

52:14.035 --> 52:15.968
     but I couldn't sleep,

52:15.970 --> 52:18.971
          so I got up,
    I looked out the window

52:18.973 --> 52:22.807
    and I only saw darkness.

52:24.242 --> 52:27.944
And I remember that my heart
   was beating so fast, Max,

52:27.946 --> 52:30.646
      then my imagination
    just started going wild,

52:30.648 --> 52:31.713
        I was thinking,

52:32.281 --> 52:33.614
  oh, gosh, what if someone's
       trying to break in

52:33.616 --> 52:34.781
        or maybe it's a
       bear, or Bigfoot,

52:34.783 --> 52:36.149
       or, I didn't know!

52:36.151 --> 52:37.817
  And as the noises continued,

52:37.819 --> 52:39.985
     I became more certain
   that something was there,

52:39.987 --> 52:41.486
       and it wasn't just
         the wind, Max,

52:41.488 --> 52:43.287
    and I knew that I needed
      to stand my ground,

52:43.289 --> 52:44.721
    because that's what your
      father would've done

52:44.723 --> 52:45.855
    if he were home, right?

52:46.289 --> 52:47.722
    So I put my slippers on,

52:47.724 --> 52:49.090
     I grabbed a flashlight

52:49.092 --> 52:50.558
     and I walked outside.

52:50.825 --> 52:53.660
   And my heart was pounding.

52:54.128 --> 52:56.496
          Boom, boom.

52:57.130 --> 52:59.498
       And then suddenly,
       I saw two red eyes

52:59.500 --> 53:00.899
      staring back at me,

53:00.901 --> 53:03.301
          I pointed my
     flashlight right at it

53:03.303 --> 53:04.568
    and you know what I saw?

53:04.802 --> 53:05.968
            What?

53:06.803 --> 53:09.538
A raccoon.

53:13.475 --> 53:14.708
          No monster?

53:15.076 --> 53:19.412
        No, it was just
      this little raccoon,

53:19.414 --> 53:21.547
    just playing with these
      old milk containers.

55:36.047 --> 55:37.213
<i> Holy mackerel!</i>

55:47.055 --> 55:49.121
<i> Yow!</i>

55:54.093 --> 55:55.225
Time for bed.

56:00.564 --> 56:01.630
            Come on.

56:13.309 --> 56:14.642
     You've had a busy day.

56:17.312 --> 56:19.079
     You're gonna sleep in
    your room tonight, okay?

56:20.247 --> 56:21.380
          Good night.

58:07.881 --> 58:09.081
            Go away!

59:03.633 --> 59:05.800
Mom, Mom!

59:05.802 --> 59:08.169
Mom, Mom, wake up, Mom, wake up,

59:08.171 --> 59:09.737
       Mom, hurry, hurry,
       I caught it, Mom!

59:09.739 --> 59:11.505
       Max, what's wrong,
         what's wrong?

59:11.507 --> 59:12.672
        Hurry, come on,
     come on, I caught it!

59:12.674 --> 59:13.739
What's wrong, Max?

59:13.741 --> 59:14.973
       Max, what's wrong?

59:14.975 --> 59:15.974
It's under there.

59:15.976 --> 59:17.408
     Why is the floor wet?

59:17.410 --> 59:20.477
             -Mom!
         -Max, stop it,

59:20.479 --> 59:22.011
      there's no monster!

01:00:40.890 --> 01:00:42.123
            Monster!

01:00:44.059 --> 01:00:45.392
     We're coming for you.

01:00:47.928 --> 01:00:49.061
       Did you hear that?

01:00:49.228 --> 01:00:50.394
        Quick, this way.

01:00:50.396 --> 01:00:51.628
        Here, get down.

01:00:53.897 --> 01:00:54.963
             Okay.

01:00:56.265 --> 01:00:57.431
          Put this on.

01:00:58.232 --> 01:00:59.298
           Take this.

01:01:02.669 --> 01:01:04.002
  You go near the nightstand,

01:01:04.336 --> 01:01:07.004
     I'm gonna investigate
      near the toy shelf,

01:01:07.006 --> 01:01:09.739
   and we meet by your pillow
   at 22 hundred hours, okay?

01:01:10.507 --> 01:01:11.840
             What?

01:01:11.842 --> 01:01:13.942
        Thirty seconds,
    go, Max, go, go, go, go!

01:01:23.685 --> 01:01:24.918
      Do you see anything?

01:01:26.053 --> 01:01:27.686
Uh, a few casualties,

01:01:27.688 --> 01:01:30.155
       I think Stevie the
        Bear is wounded!

01:01:30.422 --> 01:01:32.356
           -Save him!
          -Copy, copy!

01:01:34.092 --> 01:01:35.459
     Quick, under the bed!

01:01:36.861 --> 01:01:38.361
 The monster is under the bed!

01:01:58.013 --> 01:01:59.113
         Did I get him?

01:02:03.484 --> 01:02:04.784
        I think you did.

01:02:20.333 --> 01:02:21.566
         Snug as a bug.

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.313
      It's time for sleep.

01:02:42.051 --> 01:02:43.384
          I love you.

01:02:43.386 --> 01:02:44.485
          Good night.

01:03:00.366 --> 01:03:03.400
              Mom!

01:03:47.439 --> 01:03:48.839
         Motherfucker!

01:03:54.746 --> 01:03:55.878
            Shut up!

01:05:39.674 --> 01:05:40.740
Trick or treat!

01:06:10.603 --> 01:06:11.970
           Okay now.

01:06:12.938 --> 01:06:16.273
Come here, come here, come here.

01:06:16.275 --> 01:06:17.607
             Yeah.

01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:13.750
         Motherfucker!

01:07:19.289 --> 01:07:20.821
Oh, my God!

01:07:22.123 --> 01:07:25.592
     This looks so amazing!

01:07:25.826 --> 01:07:28.661
  Mr. Tricker you always have,
         like, the best

01:07:28.663 --> 01:07:30.329
     Halloween decorations!

01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:34.365
   Oh, my gosh, this one is,
         like, so real!

01:07:34.799 --> 01:07:37.100
- It's, like...

01:07:37.102 --> 01:07:38.501
     Is this a real person?

01:07:39.603 --> 01:07:42.338
I'm just kidding!

01:07:43.306 --> 01:07:47.108
   I just love all this like
 murder-y stuff and everything,

01:07:47.110 --> 01:07:49.443
  it's, like, totally puts me

01:07:49.445 --> 01:07:51.778
in, like, the spirit of the day

01:07:51.780 --> 01:07:53.379
       and that's, like,
        what it's about,

01:07:53.381 --> 01:07:54.947
    because it's Halloween,
        and it's, like,

01:07:54.949 --> 01:07:56.548

             like,

  what is Halloween about, so,

01:07:58.618 --> 01:08:00.284
    thank you, Mr. Tricker.

01:08:00.286 --> 01:08:02.185
         Awesome, well,
    have a happy Halloween!
