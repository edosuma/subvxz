00:08.341 --> 00:10.050
Hello!

00:10.552 --> 00:11.844
What's this?

00:12.095 --> 00:15.097
Oh, right!
It's that girl's phone number.

00:18.143 --> 00:20.936
There it is.
Just a phone number...

00:21.187 --> 00:24.023
...a really hot girl gave me.

00:25.775 --> 00:29.862
No big deal. I mean,
it is her home phone number but...

00:34.617 --> 00:35.701
Whoa!

00:37.829 --> 00:41.749
Whoops! Heh. Almost lost this baby!

00:42.459 --> 00:46.962
The lovely Amanda gives me her number,
and I go and drop it.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.222
Thank you.

01:47.023 --> 01:48.190
- Rachel?
- Yeah?

01:48.358 --> 01:50.943
- When's your birthday?
- May 5th. Why?

01:51.236 --> 01:53.529
I'm making a list of birthdays.

01:53.738 --> 01:56.365
- Mine's December...
- Yeah, whatever.

02:00.870 --> 02:02.037
Oh! She's pretty!

02:02.539 --> 02:05.958
Pretty, uh, pretty girl. The pretty...
She's pretty.

02:07.293 --> 02:09.544
- Go ask her out.
- Ha, ha.

02:09.711 --> 02:12.881
- What's the worst that could happen?
- I could die.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.884
Yeah, it's tough being single.

02:16.177 --> 02:19.304
That's why I'm so glad I found Amanda.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.891
Ross, you guys went out once.

02:23.184 --> 02:27.437
You took your kids to Chuck E. Cheese,
and you didn't even kiss her.

02:31.067 --> 02:33.402
I tell people secrets.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.195
It makes them like me.

02:39.075 --> 02:40.075
Hey.

02:41.578 --> 02:42.619
Phoebe.

02:42.787 --> 02:45.789
You're sick.
You shouldn't play. Go home.

02:46.249 --> 02:47.791
But I'm unemployed.

02:48.084 --> 02:50.627
My music is all I really have now.

02:50.920 --> 02:54.756
Well, music and making my own shoes.
Pretty, huh?

02:59.929 --> 03:01.471
All right, I'll do it.

03:01.764 --> 03:03.515
I'll go get shot down.

03:04.225 --> 03:05.434
Any advice?

03:05.602 --> 03:06.977
Just be yourself...

03:07.270 --> 03:09.146
...but not too much.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.441
Wish me luck.

03:12.775 --> 03:14.234
Good luck!

03:17.614 --> 03:19.156
Wish it!

03:20.783 --> 03:24.828
Hi. I was just sitting over there and...

03:25.121 --> 03:27.289
Uh, my name's Chandler.
Did I say that?

03:27.498 --> 03:29.666
No, you didn't. Hi, I'm Kathy.

03:29.876 --> 03:32.127
- Kathy with a K or a C?
- With a K.

03:32.337 --> 03:33.670
Hey!

03:35.632 --> 03:37.799
Wow, you are really good at this!

03:38.259 --> 03:39.968
I'm out on a limb here!

03:40.178 --> 03:42.137
I'm sorry. You're right.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.806
But I should tell you
I'm waiting for a date.

03:45.183 --> 03:47.517
And there he is now!

03:47.769 --> 03:49.353
- Hey!
- Hey!

03:49.562 --> 03:51.146
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

03:51.356 --> 03:53.815
- I see you guys already met.
- Yeah.

03:54.192 --> 03:56.193
I was trying to demonstrate...

03:56.402 --> 03:58.862
...how I could get my
very large feet...

03:59.072 --> 04:01.323
...into my even bigger mouth.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.992
Didn't I tell you?

04:04.494 --> 04:06.495
Always showing off.

04:08.289 --> 04:11.291
Before I start, I want to say
that I have a cold.

04:11.584 --> 04:15.671
So if I sneeze during a song,
it's not on purpose.

04:15.922 --> 04:19.007
Oh! Except the last verse of
"Pepper People."

04:22.845 --> 04:26.431
Smelly cat, smelly cat

04:26.683 --> 04:29.601
What are they feeding you?

04:30.561 --> 04:33.021
This chick sounds good.

04:33.856 --> 04:35.107
Smelly cat

04:36.609 --> 04:40.070
Gunther, be a good little boy
and bring me a whiskey.

04:47.704 --> 04:48.954
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:49.956 --> 04:53.417
At 2:30 a.m., I didn't expect
to fight over the remote.

04:53.626 --> 04:57.337
Sorry, there's this Ernie Kovacs
thing I wanted to watch.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.214
That's why I got up too.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.216
You're kidding? I love him!

05:03.720 --> 05:07.431
Sorry about this afternoon.
If I'd known, I wouldn't have...

05:08.057 --> 05:09.057
Oh, please. Heh.

05:10.893 --> 05:13.395
Joey tells me you two met
in acting class.

05:13.604 --> 05:17.566
We were partners.
Joey picked three scenes for us.

05:17.775 --> 05:20.569
- All of them had us making out.
- Ha-ha-ha.

05:20.737 --> 05:24.072
That's good, because he used to
make me rehearse with him.

05:26.659 --> 05:28.243
- Oh, oh, oh!
- Is it on?

05:28.453 --> 05:30.620
No, but this wonder broom is amazing!

05:30.872 --> 05:31.872
Hey!

05:34.167 --> 05:35.959
Oh, my God!

05:37.587 --> 05:38.628
Oh! It's on!

05:45.386 --> 05:48.096
Here we go, little fella.

05:49.432 --> 05:50.599
What about the duck?

05:50.808 --> 05:52.642
- The duck can swim.
- Of course.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.482
My sticky shoes

05:58.775 --> 06:01.943
My sticky, sticky shoes

06:02.779 --> 06:05.197
Why you stick on me?

06:05.448 --> 06:07.324
Baby

06:09.702 --> 06:11.703
Thanks for the lights, honey.

06:15.291 --> 06:16.458
Way to go!

06:16.667 --> 06:18.627
Your cold makes you sound great.

06:18.836 --> 06:21.797
It's fun.
God, I love how sexy I am!

06:26.511 --> 06:29.638
Kath, we should get going.
We're going to buy hamsters.

06:29.847 --> 06:31.473
- Aw.
- I love them.

06:31.682 --> 06:36.019
No, it's not like that.
I work for a medical researcher.

06:37.563 --> 06:40.148
- Have fun.
- Okay.

06:40.316 --> 06:42.984
It's nice that
the medical community...

06:43.152 --> 06:45.195
...is trying to help sick hamsters.

06:48.366 --> 06:50.033
- You know, I like Kathy.
- Yeah?

06:50.326 --> 06:53.245
Me too!
She's so cool and pretty.

06:53.496 --> 06:54.496
She is.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.998
She's smart and funny.

06:57.166 --> 07:01.503
We were up all last night talking.
She said the funniest thing about...

07:01.671 --> 07:02.963
What?

07:04.006 --> 07:06.174
You love her.

07:07.176 --> 07:08.218
No, I don't.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.846
Yes, you do. Chandler loves Kathy.

07:12.390 --> 07:16.351
- Come on, just lay off him.
- Thank you.

07:16.561 --> 07:20.230
He's a little sensitive right now
because he's so in love!

07:20.898 --> 07:22.023
All right.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.694
Ooh, Kathy!

07:25.987 --> 07:27.362
Kathy, I love you!

07:37.748 --> 07:42.002
I need to write some depressing stuff
for my new bluesy voice.

07:42.211 --> 07:44.713
But nothing sad has
ever happened to me.

07:44.881 --> 07:47.007
How about your mom dying?

07:47.216 --> 07:49.926
Or living on the streets
when you were 14?

07:50.928 --> 07:51.928
Uh-huh.

07:52.930 --> 07:56.558
I could write about when
my hair did that woo-hoo thing.

07:59.562 --> 08:01.563
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:01.814 --> 08:04.232
I'm going over to Amanda's tonight.

08:04.525 --> 08:06.109
- Rachel's not here.
- Oh.

08:09.447 --> 08:10.739
How's it going with her?

08:11.032 --> 08:14.784
Great, actually. I'm thinking
tonight may be the night.

08:15.077 --> 08:18.914
The kids will play together,
and when they're asleep...

08:19.123 --> 08:22.042
...Amanda and I break
open a bottle of wine...

08:22.251 --> 08:25.253
...do a little playing ourselves.

08:27.798 --> 08:30.342
Hi, guys! This is Josh.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.135
Josh, these are my friends.

08:32.428 --> 08:34.095
And that's Ross.

08:35.597 --> 08:36.932
- Hi, Josh.
- Hi.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.433
Dudes.

08:39.101 --> 08:40.268
You played in college?

08:40.602 --> 08:44.147
Aw, I still do.
Next year, I hope to make varsity.

08:45.483 --> 08:48.360
Didn't you play soccer
in high school?

08:48.611 --> 08:53.073
No, wait. You organized their
game schedules on your Commodore 64.

08:53.658 --> 08:58.286
It's getting late. I got to get
to the game, so I'll... head.

09:03.334 --> 09:05.126
I'll miss you.

09:05.336 --> 09:06.628
Dope!

09:11.300 --> 09:12.801
Wow! Cute one.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.303
- Very cute.
- I know. Isn't he great?

09:15.513 --> 09:19.975
So nice to finally be in a
fun relationship, you know?

09:20.184 --> 09:22.394
There's nothing boring about him.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.854
I bet he's never set foot
in a museum.

09:25.147 --> 09:26.856
Maybe he'll get to go soon.

09:27.149 --> 09:29.651
Like on a class trip or something.

09:31.612 --> 09:33.905
You know what else is
great about him?

09:34.156 --> 09:36.116
Ugh, what's the word for an adult...

09:36.325 --> 09:38.910
...who has no dinosaur toys
in their bedroom?

09:39.537 --> 09:40.620
Oh...

09:45.376 --> 09:46.668
What was that?

09:46.877 --> 09:48.003
Monica knows.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.840
It's this dumb thing Ross made up
to fool our parents.

09:52.049 --> 09:55.635
It's a way of giving the finger
without actually giving it.

09:57.847 --> 10:00.140
I cried the night you made that up.

10:00.349 --> 10:04.185
It was the first time I realized
I was cooler than my big brother.

10:05.521 --> 10:08.732
I'm going to go get ready...

10:13.195 --> 10:16.031
...for my date tonight...

10:16.240 --> 10:18.033
...so I'll just head.

10:20.411 --> 10:23.788
I should go too.
I'm playing in one hour.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.040
Hey...

10:26.917 --> 10:28.960
You guys should come hear me. Ooh!

10:29.211 --> 10:30.420
Hear me. Ooh!

10:31.297 --> 10:32.589
My sticky shoes

10:32.757 --> 10:34.507
Ew! Ew!

10:37.219 --> 10:39.262
I lost my sexy phlegm!

10:45.102 --> 10:46.936
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi, Ben.

10:47.229 --> 10:49.564
- You look great!
- Thanks.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.066
Yeah, okay...

10:51.275 --> 10:52.901
Hey, Tommy!

10:53.110 --> 10:55.403
I'm so glad you could come tonight.

10:55.613 --> 10:58.782
Oh, no. It's my pleasure.

10:59.575 --> 11:01.701
My cell phone number
is on the counter.

11:01.911 --> 11:04.079
Help yourself to the fridge.

11:04.413 --> 11:07.457
I appreciate this.
I've been trying to date...

11:07.708 --> 11:09.250
...this guy for a month.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.086
I...

11:11.295 --> 11:13.797
Uh, I'd appreciate it
if you'd drink your wine...

11:14.006 --> 11:16.299
...after the kids are asleep.

11:20.930 --> 11:21.971
Oh, uh...

11:22.223 --> 11:25.767
Thanks for this. I hope I can do
the same for you sometime.

11:32.650 --> 11:35.735
Who wants to make
some long-distance calls?

11:45.121 --> 11:46.788
Kathy! Kathy!

11:47.039 --> 11:50.083
Hi, Kathy! Kathy!

11:59.176 --> 12:00.635
Kathy!

12:05.307 --> 12:06.850
Fetch! Fetch it!

12:09.895 --> 12:12.313
Kathy! Kathy!

12:19.155 --> 12:26.161
Kathy!

12:26.704 --> 12:29.414
Hey. Chandler, what are you doing here?

12:31.208 --> 12:32.917
I just wanted to say, "hey!"

12:34.003 --> 12:37.005
- Hey!
- Okay.

12:43.679 --> 12:46.222
You're making it sound
worse than it was.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.683
Her date tipped me $10!

12:53.314 --> 12:54.731
What are you doing?

12:54.982 --> 12:58.443
I want to be sexy again,
so I'm trying to catch a cold.

12:58.652 --> 13:00.612
Should be easy.
They're pretty common.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.239
You'll catch pneumonia!

13:06.452 --> 13:09.746
You were right.
I'm in love with Joey's girlfriend.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.414
- What?
- Are you serious?

13:11.665 --> 13:13.917
How's that possible?
You barely know her.

13:14.126 --> 13:15.877
I don't know. I just...

13:16.128 --> 13:18.379
I can't get her out of my head.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.800
I'm a very bad person.
I'm a very, very bad person.

13:22.009 --> 13:23.968
I'm a horrible person.

13:26.055 --> 13:28.431
"No, you're not.
We still love you, Chandler!"

13:32.895 --> 13:34.979
Phoebe, I think I caught your cold.

13:35.231 --> 13:37.440
You mean you stole it!

13:39.401 --> 13:42.403
Don't cover your mouth
when you do that!

13:44.615 --> 13:45.824
Hey.

13:46.033 --> 13:48.493
We were just talking about you.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.870
Really?

13:51.038 --> 13:53.498
The time you got drunk
and fell asleep...

13:53.666 --> 13:54.958
...with your head in the toilet.

13:57.127 --> 13:58.461
Right in there!

14:03.509 --> 14:04.843
Ninety-nine...

14:05.344 --> 14:08.513
...a hundred.
Ready or not, here I come!

14:11.016 --> 14:13.977
Let's go over the concept
one more time.

14:14.770 --> 14:15.979
- Hey!
- Hey!

14:16.272 --> 14:19.941
You want to get some dinner
with me and Kathy tonight?

14:20.234 --> 14:23.528
Oh, um... You know what? I already ate.

14:24.864 --> 14:28.741
- It's 4:30.
- I had a big meal on Monday.

14:28.951 --> 14:31.494
So that'll get me
straight through the week.

14:32.079 --> 14:34.956
I see what's going on here.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.376
- You do?
- Yeah.

14:38.627 --> 14:40.128
You don't like Kathy.

14:41.338 --> 14:42.922
You got me.

14:43.632 --> 14:46.384
You've been avoiding her
since we started dating.

14:46.594 --> 14:48.761
I made an effort to like Janice.

14:49.013 --> 14:53.474
Now you make an effort to like Kathy
by going out with us. Right?

14:53.726 --> 14:56.644
- Yeah, right.
- Good. And hey, my treat.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.814
Because you're not eating, right?

15:00.024 --> 15:01.357
Right.

15:06.322 --> 15:07.572
Ross isn't here.

15:08.198 --> 15:10.450
Oh. Stop it!

15:13.787 --> 15:15.580
I'll see you at the party?

15:15.789 --> 15:19.208
Beer's fear, man! 24/7!

15:20.044 --> 15:21.419
Yeah!

15:24.173 --> 15:26.591
I am so going to marry that guy.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.887
- Ugh!
- What?

15:31.138 --> 15:33.056
I think he's stealing from me.

15:33.223 --> 15:34.307
Why?

15:34.475 --> 15:37.185
Because he's stealing from me!

15:38.228 --> 15:39.687
- Hi, it's me.
- Hi.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.022
And soup.

15:41.273 --> 15:44.734
I saw Josh. He looked yummy
in your leather jacket.

15:49.114 --> 15:52.533
I don't eat chicken,
so it's just noodle soup.

15:53.369 --> 15:57.789
There's no chicken in the broth,
so it's really noodle water.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.960
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.380
What are you doing?

16:05.631 --> 16:09.467
I need your germs.
I want my cold back.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.095
I miss my sexy voice.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.305
Sorry, Phoebe.

16:14.556 --> 16:16.182
It's okay.

16:16.433 --> 16:19.227
- How's the soup?
- Mm.

16:34.702 --> 16:37.996
Oh! Check it out!
You can see that girl's underwear.

16:38.205 --> 16:40.248
- Is she great, or what?
- Ha, ha.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.166
Huh? What do you think?

16:43.836 --> 16:45.586
She's not really my type.

16:45.838 --> 16:48.506
Not your type? She's gorgeous.

16:49.174 --> 16:52.218
You know what it is?
The fishnet stockings.

16:52.428 --> 16:55.680
Whenever I see a girl in those,
it reminds me of...

16:55.931 --> 16:57.932
...my father in fishnet stockings.

16:59.685 --> 17:03.062
Understanding a little more of
why you're single.

17:03.313 --> 17:06.941
I have a friend you'd like.
We could double date.

17:07.192 --> 17:09.277
No, thanks.

17:09.486 --> 17:13.573
I've got some ugly friends
who are available too.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.367
I'm going to grab a beer.

17:17.953 --> 17:19.119
I'll be right back.

17:25.252 --> 17:27.587
- What was that?
- What?

17:28.130 --> 17:31.174
Kathy's being really nice
and you walked away.

17:31.425 --> 17:33.217
What do you want from me?

17:33.469 --> 17:35.094
I want you to like her.

17:35.345 --> 17:39.223
If that's too damn difficult,
then at least you could pretend.

17:39.767 --> 17:40.808
I am pretending.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.393
Then do it better.

17:42.978 --> 17:46.439
What do you say, I go tell her
how much I like her?

17:46.940 --> 17:49.358
I could tell her
I've been thinking of her.

17:49.610 --> 17:51.944
I haven't stopped thinking
of her since we met.

17:52.196 --> 17:55.156
I'm so over-the-top,
want-to-slit-my-own-throat...

17:55.365 --> 17:58.367
...in love with her,
that every minute...

17:58.577 --> 18:02.497
...I can't believe my own damn bad luck
that you met her first!

18:03.082 --> 18:04.373
That's pretty good.

18:07.795 --> 18:10.421
But you might want
to tone it down a little.

18:15.344 --> 18:19.847
Hey. Uh, Amanda just dropped me off.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.683
That's one of the things
I love about her.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.936
She's old enough to drive.

18:26.772 --> 18:30.024
You're not going
to Mom and Dad's tonight?

18:30.317 --> 18:31.526
No. Sorry.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.361
Where's Amanda?

18:33.570 --> 18:35.113
Get me some cough drops.

18:35.322 --> 18:37.573
I'm thinking you could bring her...

18:37.825 --> 18:41.119
...and go to your old room
and not make out.

18:42.412 --> 18:43.788
Cough drop, please?

18:44.039 --> 18:46.332
At least she's not
going out with me...

18:46.583 --> 18:48.584
...to get into R-rated movies.

18:50.212 --> 18:52.338
Why don't you marry her?

18:52.589 --> 18:56.259
Wait, you can't! I forgot.
She's not a lesbian.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.263
Amanda and I...

19:00.556 --> 19:02.140
You have nothing!

19:02.558 --> 19:06.102
You're not even going out!
You're her babysitter.

19:06.436 --> 19:09.438
You have a 12-year-old girl's job!

19:17.030 --> 19:18.823
Oh, that is so sad.

19:20.909 --> 19:24.328
What are you laughing at,
Miss My-keg-sucking-boyfriend...

19:24.538 --> 19:26.122
...- is-stealing-from me?

19:28.834 --> 19:31.335
So he stole a few bucks.
Big deal!

19:31.587 --> 19:33.421
He got me something with it.

19:33.630 --> 19:35.298
That's mine!

19:38.218 --> 19:41.971
Would you both please
start acting like adults?

19:42.181 --> 19:44.682
And give me my cough drops!

19:46.351 --> 19:48.394
- Fine.
- Sorry.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.938
- Here.
- Thank you.

19:53.525 --> 19:56.360
At least I made $10 in my relationship.

19:58.405 --> 19:59.697
You know...

20:06.455 --> 20:09.207
Parading goats are parading

20:09.458 --> 20:11.500
Parading down the street

20:12.294 --> 20:14.962
Parading goats are parading

20:15.214 --> 20:18.132
Leaving little treats

20:19.051 --> 20:21.802
Does it even work
without my sexy voice?

20:22.054 --> 20:23.471
I like it.

20:25.140 --> 20:27.642
- Gunther, kiss me.
- What?

20:35.192 --> 20:36.817
Do it, Deputy! Do something!

20:45.994 --> 20:46.994
Hey!

20:49.831 --> 20:53.084
We aren't exactly sleeping in here,
but do you mind?

21:01.426 --> 21:03.511
Can I sleep on your couch?

21:15.315 --> 21:17.650
And I'm still waiting

21:17.859 --> 21:20.319
For my papier-mâché man

21:23.949 --> 21:25.199
Thank you, my babies.

21:29.204 --> 21:31.539
- Rachel?
- Yeah?

21:32.249 --> 21:36.127
Did you hear what happened
between me and Phoebe?

21:36.461 --> 21:38.546
- No.
- We kissed.

21:38.714 --> 21:42.550
I didn't initiate it,
but I also didn't stop it.

21:42.926 --> 21:44.468
I've been feeling guilty.

21:47.764 --> 21:48.889
Okay

21:49.391 --> 21:50.850
So, um...

21:51.727 --> 21:52.727
...are we cool?

21:56.732 --> 21:57.898
Okay.

21:58.900 --> 22:01.068
I knew you would understand.
