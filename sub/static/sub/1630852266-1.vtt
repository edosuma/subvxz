01:00.415 --> 01:03.855
Vienna is a city obsessed by titles.

01:05.135 --> 01:08.253
In London, I was Max. Just Max.

01:08.255 --> 01:10.933
In Vienna, I am
Dr Maximilian Liebermann,

01:10.935 --> 01:13.613
physician, neurologist...
and Englishman...

01:13.615 --> 01:16.893
...of course. They don't
let you forget that.

01:16.895 --> 01:19.053
The capital of
a thousand-year-old empire,

01:19.055 --> 01:21.093
it's also a pedant's heaven.

01:21.095 --> 01:23.373
A family's reputation
can be ruined by

01:23.375 --> 01:25.053
the length of a woman's hem.

01:25.055 --> 01:27.095
There are rules here for everything.

01:29.535 --> 01:34.173
Romantic memories are pathogenic.
They create disease.

01:34.175 --> 01:37.453
Banishment of painful,
emotionally charged memories

01:37.455 --> 01:42.973
from one's consciousness requires
an active repressing mechanism.

01:42.975 --> 01:44.933
This is Vienna's gilded age,

01:44.935 --> 01:48.815
and yet there is something
unsettling deep below the surface...

01:49.775 --> 01:53.373
...a shadow realm the city
is struggling to hide.

01:53.375 --> 01:55.133
Welcome to Vienna.

01:55.135 --> 01:57.335
Welcome to my world.

02:11.495 --> 02:13.495
Holy Christ!

02:22.095 --> 02:25.615
Do we have a name?
Neighbours didn't know her.

02:28.695 --> 02:31.653
What's she saying? You speak Slovak.

02:31.655 --> 02:33.413
Just nonsense.

02:33.415 --> 02:35.933
Get her out of here.

02:37.415 --> 02:39.575
Go out, out. Please.

02:48.895 --> 02:52.373
"God forgive me.
I have tasted forbidden fruit

02:52.375 --> 02:53.815
"and he will take...

02:55.295 --> 02:57.053
"..take me to hell."

02:57.055 --> 02:59.055
A suicide.

03:00.535 --> 03:02.455
Then where's the weapon?

03:04.535 --> 03:06.573
Someone must have come in here
and taken it.

03:06.575 --> 03:09.135
Door was locked from the inside.

03:11.175 --> 03:15.493
Bolted. It's the third floor.
Impossible to climb.

03:15.495 --> 03:18.133
It doesn't make sense.
If she'd killed herself,

03:18.135 --> 03:19.655
the weapon would still be here.

03:21.575 --> 03:25.693
The assailant tried to dress
the thing up as suicide, panicked

03:25.695 --> 03:27.335
and forgot to leave the weapon.

03:29.215 --> 03:32.893
Her door was locked.
The key was on the inside.

03:32.895 --> 03:35.653
Windows? Flue?
Welded shut.

03:35.655 --> 03:38.253
No-one could have made it
in or out of there.

03:38.255 --> 03:41.573
So you are saying
we have an invisible weapon

03:41.575 --> 03:44.655
and a killer who can pass
through walls, Inspector?

03:46.095 --> 03:48.853
You were on duty
when the call came in?

03:48.855 --> 03:52.293
I'm not sure this is
the right case for you, Rheinhardt.

03:52.295 --> 03:54.215
It's a cab rank!

03:55.775 --> 03:58.053
We take the first case that comes.

03:58.055 --> 03:59.295
Very well.

04:00.815 --> 04:02.533
There is someone
I need you to meet first,

04:02.535 --> 04:04.813
a junior doctor
from the hospital.

04:04.815 --> 04:06.935
He's asked to observe
a criminal case.

04:10.015 --> 04:11.893
I'd prefer not to have outsiders...

04:11.895 --> 04:14.733
You're to afford him every courtesy.

04:14.735 --> 04:17.093
His father is a personal friend.

04:17.095 --> 04:19.135
Dr Liebermann?

04:22.655 --> 04:24.775
Inspector Rheinhardt.

04:46.895 --> 04:49.413
What do I call you? Doctor?

04:49.415 --> 04:52.133
Max. My name is Max.

04:52.135 --> 04:53.255
And you?

04:54.695 --> 04:56.415
Inspector.

05:02.575 --> 05:05.533
Woman murdered in Leopoldstadt.

05:05.535 --> 05:07.935
Shot through the heart
at close range.

05:10.535 --> 05:13.455
Killer laid her out like she was
a model in a painting.

05:19.535 --> 05:22.173
You're just here
as an observer, right?

05:22.175 --> 05:23.935
The psychopathy
of the criminal mind.

05:24.935 --> 05:26.215
Catchy.

05:35.655 --> 05:38.333
A useless life is an early death.

05:38.335 --> 05:40.215
Morning, Dr Behr.

05:44.135 --> 05:46.533
There is muzzle bruising.

05:46.535 --> 05:48.733
Also, some powder burns.

05:48.735 --> 05:51.813
Look. Weapon must have been old,

05:51.815 --> 05:53.213
antique.

05:53.215 --> 05:56.813
How long has she been dead?
More than a day. Less than two.

05:56.815 --> 06:00.133
So, in terms of opportunity?
You should widen your search

06:00.135 --> 06:02.653
to everyone in the empire.

06:02.655 --> 06:04.055
May I?

06:05.815 --> 06:08.453
A little malnourished, perhaps.

06:08.455 --> 06:11.295
No evidence of cholera.
Anything else?

06:12.935 --> 06:15.695
Sorry. Just observing.

06:30.855 --> 06:32.533
Did someone put you up to this?

06:32.535 --> 06:35.255
What?
There is no bullet!

06:37.375 --> 06:41.775
See? This is where it entered.
But...

06:43.095 --> 06:46.213
...there is no exit wound,

06:46.215 --> 06:49.735
no sign of tampering, no surgery.

06:52.055 --> 06:53.853
So what the hell happened here?

06:53.855 --> 06:55.653
We are victims of a hoax.

06:55.655 --> 06:57.973
Either that,

06:57.975 --> 07:00.375
or someone has been
practising witchcraft.

07:14.015 --> 07:16.655
A vanishing gun...

07:19.815 --> 07:21.493
...and a...

07:21.495 --> 07:24.013
...ghost bullet.

07:24.015 --> 07:27.575
She was some sort of mystic.
Would you mind staying silent?

07:29.175 --> 07:30.855
Please don't touch that!

07:36.775 --> 07:39.613
No-one knows her. I knocked
on every door. Got nothing.

07:39.615 --> 07:41.333
I don't believe it. It's impossible.

07:41.335 --> 07:43.055
No-one seen going in or out.
No visitors.

07:44.775 --> 07:47.413
What about the concierge?
Rent was paid.

07:47.415 --> 07:50.533
Slipped under the door every month.
Says she doesn't know her name.

07:50.535 --> 07:53.053
I want this whole area
trawled for witnesses.

07:53.055 --> 07:54.773
You don't sleep
until you get me a name.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.613
You understand? Erm...?

07:56.615 --> 07:58.293
Haussman, sir.

07:58.295 --> 08:00.893
Haussman. Someone must know
something about her.

08:00.895 --> 08:03.693
The weapon. We're looking
for an antique gun.

08:03.695 --> 08:06.415
Maybe a collector, somebody
with military connections.

08:24.455 --> 08:26.013
Do you have to do that?

08:26.015 --> 08:27.853
What?

08:27.855 --> 08:29.733
You're staring.

08:29.735 --> 08:32.015
Well, I was told
I could observe you.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.732
Where would you prefer me to look?

08:36.735 --> 08:38.493
I'd prefer it if you weren't here.

08:38.495 --> 08:40.813
It was difficult to tell that
from your manner...!

08:40.815 --> 08:43.653
Remind me, why exactly
are you here, Doctor?

08:43.655 --> 08:45.653
I thought the Commissioner
explained.

08:45.655 --> 08:47.373
He said I was to tolerate
your presence.

08:47.375 --> 08:49.333
I'm making a study
of criminal behaviour.

08:49.335 --> 08:52.893
Really? Then why aren't you
in a laboratory somewhere,

08:52.895 --> 08:54.293
dissecting brains?

08:54.295 --> 08:57.253
Because the way to study the mind
is to observe the living,

08:57.255 --> 09:00.093
for example, a policeman,

09:00.095 --> 09:02.613
maybe 20 years of service,

09:02.615 --> 09:04.373
a position of seniority,

09:04.375 --> 09:06.293
and yet he is impatient,
he's heavy-footed,

09:06.295 --> 09:08.893
he's slamming drawers,
eating coffee beans,

09:08.895 --> 09:11.093
perspiring, even though
it's cold in here,

09:11.095 --> 09:13.133
forgetting the names
of his colleagues.

09:13.135 --> 09:16.093
So I would have to say
he's anxious to get a result.

09:16.095 --> 09:18.533
Not anxious.

09:18.535 --> 09:19.973
Desperate.

09:19.975 --> 09:23.415
Maybe it's been a while
since he solved a case.

09:41.295 --> 09:43.253
I know, and I'm sorry.
It's six o'clock!

09:43.255 --> 09:45.013
It's a quarter past six.

09:45.015 --> 09:47.173
Well, I ran all the way.
You're not even changed yet.

09:47.175 --> 09:49.335
You're going to be horribly late.

10:29.775 --> 10:32.253
So, did you meet with
the Police Commissioner?

10:32.255 --> 10:34.093
Yes. He's assigned me to a case.

10:34.095 --> 10:37.653
A murder in Leopoldstadt. A young
woman shot through the heart.

10:37.655 --> 10:39.693
Hardly a fit discussion
for the table!

10:39.695 --> 10:41.975
Let's talk about
something more pleasant.

10:42.935 --> 10:44.693
Are you seeing Clara tonight?

10:44.695 --> 10:45.735
Yes.

10:47.295 --> 10:49.493
I'm taking her to see
the Beethoven Frieze.

10:49.495 --> 10:52.013
Last chance before it's sold.
Sold?

10:52.015 --> 10:55.055
Lovely girl. Such a sweet nature.

10:56.495 --> 11:00.133
How are things between you two? Oh,
Mother, you know there's no point.

11:00.135 --> 11:01.815
Stop pushing him!

11:03.375 --> 11:06.535
Max will do what Max wants to do.

11:20.255 --> 11:22.213
There.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.933
Gosh, yes.

11:23.935 --> 11:25.813
The Beethoven Frieze.

11:25.815 --> 11:28.733
Gustav Klimt. I wanted you
to see it before it's gone.

11:28.735 --> 11:29.975
It's...

11:31.295 --> 11:33.695
Extraordinary, don't you think?

11:36.535 --> 11:38.255
You don't like it.

11:39.215 --> 11:42.413
I find it frightening,
to be honest, Max.

11:42.415 --> 11:44.855
Almost like a nightmare.
Yes.

11:45.855 --> 11:47.893
Images of madness.

11:47.895 --> 11:50.293
Forbidden wishes.

11:50.295 --> 11:51.495
I'm sorry.

11:53.735 --> 11:55.695
You were hoping I would love it.

11:57.615 --> 12:00.733
Painters these days,
they are no longer content

12:00.735 --> 12:02.493
just to paint you as you are,

12:02.495 --> 12:05.853
smiling, in your best dress,
beside a bowl of apples.

12:05.855 --> 12:09.733
I think apples
have had their day, Clara.

12:09.735 --> 12:11.695
"To every age its art."

12:12.695 --> 12:16.053
Would you pay more attention to me
if I were to pose for you like her?

12:16.055 --> 12:18.573
Well, I think everyone
would pay you attention

12:18.575 --> 12:20.533
if you were naked
on a hundred-foot canvas.

12:20.535 --> 12:23.575
Well then, perhaps
I should volunteer.

12:25.175 --> 12:26.655
Kiss me, Max.

12:28.015 --> 12:29.413
Kiss me now.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.933
Right here?

12:30.935 --> 12:32.653
Yes.

12:32.655 --> 12:34.253
We're playing a game.

12:34.255 --> 12:36.215
Oh? What game is it
this time, Clara?

12:37.575 --> 12:41.973
It is called "Prove to me
that I'm more attractive

12:41.975 --> 12:44.335
"than a painting".

12:54.335 --> 12:56.855
Hm. The Mayor.

12:59.135 --> 13:00.933
Election time again.

13:00.935 --> 13:04.053
Why don't I introduce you?

13:04.055 --> 13:06.013
I'm no good at conversation.

13:06.015 --> 13:08.495
Oh, Max! What will I do with you?

13:11.615 --> 13:13.935
Sir.
Thank you.

13:51.295 --> 13:53.413
Don't touch me!

13:53.415 --> 13:54.853
Don't...

13:54.855 --> 13:57.053
...touch me!

13:57.055 --> 14:00.333
Don't touch me!

14:07.375 --> 14:10.053
Max?
Get a carriage!

14:10.055 --> 14:11.655
Quickly, Clara!

14:24.935 --> 14:27.215
I need to admit a patient.
Yes, sir.

14:41.215 --> 14:42.893
Don't...

14:45.295 --> 14:47.015
Please help me!

14:51.495 --> 14:52.935
Please...

14:54.655 --> 14:57.255
Please stop.
Take her over there.

15:01.255 --> 15:02.295
Please!

15:29.895 --> 15:32.053
Search every apartment.

15:32.055 --> 15:33.975
Knock on every door!

15:35.255 --> 15:36.653
We need the victim's name!

15:36.655 --> 15:38.453
Open up!

15:41.735 --> 15:43.053
This is the police!

15:43.055 --> 15:45.015
Knock on every door!

15:48.895 --> 15:51.455
Do you know the name of
the woman who lived upstairs?

15:56.255 --> 15:57.973
Do you know the woman
who lived upstairs?

15:57.975 --> 16:00.935
Do you know the name of
the woman who lived upstairs?

16:05.295 --> 16:07.653
You're late.
I've been waiting.

16:07.655 --> 16:09.575
Here.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.853
Ah.
Good morning.

16:24.855 --> 16:25.935
Oskar.

16:27.855 --> 16:30.133
This time,
you really disappointed us.

16:30.135 --> 16:33.493
What? Can't even keep a lid
on your own investigation.

16:33.495 --> 16:36.093
You've made the front page.

16:36.095 --> 16:37.493
Suspects?

16:37.495 --> 16:38.893
No, sir.

16:38.895 --> 16:40.135
Witnesses?

16:41.815 --> 16:43.933
Not as yet.

16:43.935 --> 16:47.413
And now the investigation
is leaking like a rusty ship.

16:47.415 --> 16:50.613
"Killed by a spectre
summoned at a seance."

16:50.615 --> 16:53.293
How the hell did they
get hold of this?

16:53.295 --> 16:55.973
The Mayor telephoned.

16:55.975 --> 16:58.213
We need to kill this speculation.

16:58.215 --> 17:00.295
The only way is to make an arrest.

17:02.295 --> 17:05.252
Perhaps it's too soon.

17:05.255 --> 17:08.575
No shame in stepping aside.
Von Bulow's offered to take over.

17:11.335 --> 17:15.055
Just giving the case
to someone who can handle it.

17:17.015 --> 17:18.454
No, sir.

17:20.015 --> 17:21.775
I want to finish this.

17:26.454 --> 17:27.615
Inspector?

18:05.615 --> 18:08.173
I was told I could observe
a criminal case.

18:08.175 --> 18:10.093
And presumably, that means

18:10.095 --> 18:13.175
you and I will have to be
in the same room occasionally.

18:31.695 --> 18:34.813
Yesterday evening, you said I seemed

18:34.815 --> 18:38.973
anxious, impatient, desperate. You
went through the whole dictionary.

18:38.975 --> 18:41.013
How did you know what I was feeling?

18:41.015 --> 18:43.933
Do you find me unsettling,
Inspector?

18:43.935 --> 18:46.175
One or two other words
spring to mind, actually.

18:47.655 --> 18:50.573
There's a professor
who lectures in Vienna.

18:50.575 --> 18:53.213
He claims that anything
you wish to know about a person

18:53.215 --> 18:58.373
you can tell through observation -
their clothes or their mannerisms,

18:58.375 --> 19:01.533
the way they hold their pen
and their coffee cup.

19:01.535 --> 19:05.333
He teaches that human behaviour
is eloquent.

19:05.335 --> 19:09.093
Our little foibles, our jokes,

19:09.095 --> 19:11.933
even the mistakes we make,

19:11.935 --> 19:15.453
every tiny grace note and inflection

19:15.455 --> 19:19.135
gives a clue as to what is
going on inside the brain.

19:20.495 --> 19:22.495
I've become fascinated
by his work...

19:23.735 --> 19:28.015
...though, sad to say, his teachings
aren't popular everywhere.

19:30.295 --> 19:32.613
I studied you
and I made a diagnosis.

19:32.615 --> 19:35.893
Well, then, Doctor, sorry
to interrupt your lecture,

19:35.895 --> 19:38.335
but maybe you want
to study this instead.

19:40.135 --> 19:42.333
You're asking me to comment?

19:42.335 --> 19:45.693
I thought I was just an observer.

19:45.695 --> 19:49.295
I'm asking for your help.
Either you will or you won't.

19:54.415 --> 19:55.935
I've nothing to go on.

19:58.415 --> 20:00.493
No-one knows the victim.

20:00.495 --> 20:02.133
She's a blank page.

20:02.135 --> 20:03.613
That trick that you do...

20:03.615 --> 20:05.933
It's not a trick.

20:05.935 --> 20:07.775
...the way that you look at people...

20:09.295 --> 20:12.615
...will you look at her, tell me
what you see, Dr Liebermann?

20:54.655 --> 20:57.813
Well? What do you see?

20:57.815 --> 20:59.375
Anything?

21:00.335 --> 21:03.693
She's dead, Inspector. It makes
primary observation difficult.

21:19.095 --> 21:21.293
It's a stage set.

21:21.295 --> 21:22.775
What?

21:26.655 --> 21:28.455
Do you have any matches?

21:33.455 --> 21:37.735
This room has been decorated
like a pantomime stage.

21:42.295 --> 21:43.653
Ooh!

21:43.655 --> 21:46.053
No spirits.

21:46.055 --> 21:47.495
Stage magic.

21:49.895 --> 21:52.175
This is all an elaborate con.

22:01.615 --> 22:04.295
Whoever killed her
knew she was a sham...

22:05.455 --> 22:08.455
...dressed up her death
like one of her own tricks.

22:10.175 --> 22:12.895
There's more than one illusionist
at work here.

22:18.375 --> 22:20.333
What is it?

22:20.335 --> 22:23.493
It's empty.
Where are all the dresses?

22:23.495 --> 22:26.773
You think that significant?
Well, if this was a stage set,

22:26.775 --> 22:30.295
there ought to be costumes.
We need to see her again.

22:34.575 --> 22:39.413
Why does a woman empty her wardrobe,
dispatch all her dresses at once?

22:39.415 --> 22:40.893
Think! Come on.

22:40.895 --> 22:44.573
Why am I being interrogated? I'm
supposed to be the damned policeman!

22:44.575 --> 22:46.373
Well, you asked me my opinion!

22:46.375 --> 22:49.613
Yes, but I didn't know it was
going to be served up this way!

22:49.615 --> 22:51.933
Has anyone ever told you
how insufferable you are?

22:51.935 --> 22:54.295
As it happens,
about a dozen times a day.

22:55.495 --> 22:57.173
"Take me to hell."

22:57.175 --> 22:59.733
She made an error. She began
by writing another word.

22:59.735 --> 23:01.695
It says "us"
beneath the word "me".

23:03.415 --> 23:04.695
What?

23:06.775 --> 23:09.333
He forced her to write that
under stress,

23:09.335 --> 23:11.255
and she made a damning admission.

23:14.015 --> 23:16.495
Someone else was going to
die with her.

23:18.935 --> 23:21.055
Welcome to the case, Inspector.

23:35.255 --> 23:36.453
What is it?

23:36.455 --> 23:38.895
We need a postmortem on her womb.

24:19.735 --> 24:22.013
There's your motive, Inspector.

24:22.015 --> 24:24.173
No demons.

24:24.175 --> 24:26.053
Just a man.

24:26.055 --> 24:27.815
An adulterer.

24:29.935 --> 24:32.095
Someone was about to be exposed.

24:33.935 --> 24:36.373
Find the father of this child.

24:36.375 --> 24:38.415
He's your killer.

24:51.855 --> 24:53.613
Herr Liebermann!

24:53.615 --> 24:55.853
Bruckmuller.
Ah, yes, of course.

24:55.855 --> 24:57.293
I know you by reputation.

24:57.295 --> 25:02.895
That's just a polite way of saying
you've been listening to gossip.

25:03.855 --> 25:06.493
I am flattered
that you've invited me here.

25:06.495 --> 25:08.333
Oh, let's not be coy,
Herr Liebermann.

25:08.335 --> 25:10.335
Political campaigns cost money.

25:11.815 --> 25:14.493
Herr Holderlein
from the Central Bank.

25:14.495 --> 25:17.133
I don't think we've met, Herr...?

25:17.135 --> 25:20.373
Liebermann. Oh, how do you do?
How do you do?

25:20.375 --> 25:24.213
And Herr Adler,
the munitions manufacturer.

25:24.215 --> 25:26.495
How do you do?
Pleasure to meet you.

25:29.255 --> 25:32.453
I don't invite them
for their conversation.

25:32.455 --> 25:34.535
Adler is intolerably dull.

25:35.815 --> 25:39.733
But everyone here
has one redeeming feature.

25:39.735 --> 25:42.373
I assume you are talking about
their bank accounts.

25:42.375 --> 25:45.895
Look around you. The Viennese elite.

25:47.055 --> 25:48.975
We can offer status.

25:50.295 --> 25:52.133
I doubt that the Jewish Quarter

25:52.135 --> 25:54.815
provides much in the way
of social introductions.

25:55.895 --> 25:57.613
You're right.

25:57.615 --> 26:00.173
I don't know any of these men.

26:00.175 --> 26:02.413
They have never sought my company.

26:02.415 --> 26:04.693
Well, as the Mayor
is fond of saying,

26:04.695 --> 26:07.895
we decide who's a Jew
and who is not, Herr Liebermann.

26:09.255 --> 26:11.455
Come, take a seat.

26:14.735 --> 26:16.255
Dr Liebermann?

26:18.495 --> 26:21.053
You haven't attended my tutorials
for over a week.

26:21.055 --> 26:24.333
You think there is nothing
you can learn from me?

26:24.335 --> 26:26.173
No, of course.

26:26.175 --> 26:28.813
I'm about to give a demonstration.

26:28.815 --> 26:30.735
Perhaps you would do me
the courtesy?

26:34.495 --> 26:40.655
Signora Locatelli here displays
symptoms of acute hysteria.

26:45.295 --> 26:47.613
Hysteria is a medical condition,

26:47.615 --> 26:52.855
one that can be swiftly
and permanently corrected.

28:04.855 --> 28:06.495
Have you seen my dog?

28:09.655 --> 28:11.575
Have you seen my dog?

28:22.735 --> 28:23.855
Excuse me?

28:28.775 --> 28:30.655
I'm Dr Liebermann.

28:32.815 --> 28:35.495
We met. The exhibition.

28:56.175 --> 28:57.693
Seamstresses.

28:57.695 --> 28:59.253
Dressmakers.

28:59.255 --> 29:01.173
Tailors.

29:01.175 --> 29:03.255
Anyone who might
take in alterations.

29:04.455 --> 29:09.133
Find those dresses and we'll find
the dead woman's name.

29:09.135 --> 29:10.335
Now! Move!

29:14.175 --> 29:15.895
Haussman?

29:35.615 --> 29:37.933
Rosa Sucher?
Yes.

29:37.935 --> 29:40.015
Vienna Police. May I come in?

29:44.695 --> 29:48.495
You run a business as a seamstress?
That's correct.

29:58.535 --> 30:00.453
What are you writing?

30:00.455 --> 30:02.453
It's nothing. It's, er...

30:02.455 --> 30:03.733
Sorry. Not my business.

30:03.735 --> 30:05.933
This case in Leopoldstadt.

30:05.935 --> 30:08.493
The psychopathy of a killer.

30:08.495 --> 30:10.413
You know, I always imagined
that one day

30:10.415 --> 30:13.373
there'd be a sign above
the emporium, Liebermann & Son.

30:13.375 --> 30:14.613
I know.

30:14.615 --> 30:16.093
And I'm sorry...

30:16.095 --> 30:17.413
No, no.

30:17.415 --> 30:19.733
A doctor in the family
is a fine thing.

30:19.735 --> 30:21.293
But?

30:21.295 --> 30:26.053
This... new science of yours,
your chosen field of study...

30:26.055 --> 30:29.413
Here it comes... some people
are saying it's dubious.

30:29.415 --> 30:31.653
Who do you mean? What people?

30:31.655 --> 30:33.773
Just chatter over luncheon.

30:33.775 --> 30:36.093
Well, you can tell these people

30:36.095 --> 30:38.293
that Sigmund Freud
has just been made a professor.

30:38.295 --> 30:39.973
You know what they're calling it?

30:39.975 --> 30:41.693
The "disreputable" medicine.

30:41.695 --> 30:43.773
Well then, they're as ignorant
as they are stupid.

30:43.775 --> 30:45.093
Talking cures and hysterics,

30:45.095 --> 30:47.093
exploring the darkness
of men's souls.

30:47.095 --> 30:49.653
Are you really sure
what you're getting into, Max?

30:49.655 --> 30:52.613
Is it really the career
for a gentleman?

30:52.615 --> 30:55.453
Of course. You're worried
about our reputation.

30:55.455 --> 30:58.133
Max... If I'd been a surgeon
or general practitioner,

30:58.135 --> 30:59.773
you could have faced your friends.

30:59.775 --> 31:02.533
I don't want you to make a mistake
that's going to haunt you

31:02.535 --> 31:03.975
for the rest of your days.

31:05.535 --> 31:07.453
You're passionate.

31:07.455 --> 31:09.453
Always admired that.

31:09.455 --> 31:10.893
Your mother's son.

31:10.895 --> 31:14.893
You throw yourself into
each new thing with enthusiasm.

31:14.895 --> 31:17.373
But this... this is different.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.653
You don't understand.
We are witnessing the birth

31:19.655 --> 31:24.415
of a whole new science. It could
take you to a very dark place.

32:00.095 --> 32:03.255
I know you. I've seen you before.

32:04.215 --> 32:06.055
You smiled at me as I came in.

32:07.775 --> 32:09.133
I'm an artist.

32:09.135 --> 32:11.215
A painter?
Illusionist!

32:30.095 --> 32:32.135
You make things disappear?

32:39.695 --> 32:42.535
Just have to drink it
to get it out again.

32:50.495 --> 32:54.453
I offered her six Kronen
for the lot. Five dresses.

32:54.455 --> 32:57.333
The lady from Leopoldstadt,
she brought them round to you?

32:57.335 --> 33:00.295
Came to my apartment a week ago.

33:02.095 --> 33:03.975
We don't even know her name.

33:05.335 --> 33:07.053
Fraulein Lowenstein.

33:07.055 --> 33:08.093
Charlotte.

33:08.095 --> 33:09.735
Charlotte Lowenstein?

33:11.975 --> 33:13.095
Just a moment.

33:24.615 --> 33:27.173
Miss Sucher, how did she find you?

33:27.175 --> 33:28.813
I'm sorry?

33:28.815 --> 33:34.493
Well, she wanted a seamstress, so...

33:34.495 --> 33:36.053
Well, do you advertise?

33:36.055 --> 33:38.495
Oh, no. I knew her, sir, already.

33:41.255 --> 33:43.533
I see.

33:43.535 --> 33:45.093
You were a client.

33:45.095 --> 33:48.855
You went to her salon to take part
in a ritual, a seance.

33:52.055 --> 33:55.495
My mother, she... she died
last year.

33:56.655 --> 34:00.333
The Fraulein, she had
an extraordinary gift.

34:00.335 --> 34:01.893
We met together in her rooms.

34:01.895 --> 34:04.773
"We"?
Seven of us.

34:04.775 --> 34:07.735
You were never seen?
It was always late at night.

34:24.175 --> 34:26.415
Join hands, my beloveds...

34:27.375 --> 34:30.375
...and let the host of spirits enter.

34:39.695 --> 34:44.215
I conjure you by the name of
the Dark King, who rules over you.

34:50.815 --> 34:53.175
Rosa... who were the others?

34:56.695 --> 35:01.455
I don't know names, apart from one,
the man who introduced me.

35:03.095 --> 35:04.695
Otto Braun.

35:12.415 --> 35:15.533
Seven, including
Charlotte Lowenstein,

35:15.535 --> 35:19.813
the only people we can place
in that salon. And...

35:19.815 --> 35:22.535
...we have our first
gentleman caller.

35:24.775 --> 35:27.973
She said she met him
in the cemetery.

35:27.975 --> 35:30.655
He was the bait, Inspector.

35:40.335 --> 35:41.933
Good day. Do you know Otto Braun?

35:41.935 --> 35:43.935
No.

36:03.695 --> 36:05.455
Hello, sir.

36:13.055 --> 36:14.813
Braun.

36:14.815 --> 36:16.375
The magician?

36:18.815 --> 36:21.773
Hmm. Paid his bills.
Treated me all right.

36:21.775 --> 36:25.735
What do you want with him?
We need to know where to find him.

36:49.175 --> 36:51.815
Otto Braun?
Back stairs.

37:31.255 --> 37:32.653
Herr Braun?

37:32.655 --> 37:34.973
Please forgive the intrusion.

37:34.975 --> 37:37.053
I'm with the Vienna Police.

37:37.055 --> 37:39.255
Is this an inconvenient moment?

37:47.135 --> 37:48.535
Excuse us, madam.

38:15.095 --> 38:18.495
It's just a normal day, then?
You said you wanted to observe.

39:15.975 --> 39:17.973
Otto Braun?

39:17.975 --> 39:20.215
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

39:23.175 --> 39:25.255
Welcome to the case, Doctor.

39:26.895 --> 39:28.575
Your hat!

39:29.535 --> 39:31.095
Thank you.

39:35.615 --> 39:38.733
Two days. Been in all the papers.

39:38.735 --> 39:40.575
You didn't come forward, Otto.

39:44.615 --> 39:47.295
We've got a witness
that can put you at the cemetery.

39:48.575 --> 39:50.253
Rosa Sucher?

39:50.255 --> 39:52.095
Recall her, do you?

39:53.855 --> 39:56.173
Her mother died last year.

39:56.175 --> 39:59.813
She's laying flowers at the grave
and you stroll up to her,

39:59.815 --> 40:01.935
start telling her fairy tales...

40:06.815 --> 40:12.335
...about a woman with a gift, a woman
that communes with the spirit world.

40:16.015 --> 40:18.493
Charlotte had an accomplice,

40:18.495 --> 40:20.413
someone pulling the strings.

40:20.415 --> 40:24.775
We know what you do for a living,
Otto. Your little friend told us.

40:26.975 --> 40:28.895
You're a magician, aren't you?

40:34.295 --> 40:38.173
You went to the cemetery
and preyed on grieving people!

40:38.175 --> 40:41.215
How many of them did you con?
How much did you charge them?

40:42.775 --> 40:46.013
Look into my eyes! It's not a crime.
I did nothing wrong!

40:46.015 --> 40:50.093
No? Then why did you run from us?
Why are you so scared, Otto?

40:50.095 --> 40:51.893
Look into my eyes!

40:51.895 --> 40:53.495
You disgust me!

40:55.975 --> 40:58.335
I'll tell the Commissioner
we have someone in custody.

41:05.455 --> 41:06.975
What are you staring at?

41:08.535 --> 41:10.653
How long have you worked
at the theatre?

41:10.655 --> 41:13.055
What's that got to do with you?

41:17.175 --> 41:19.335
I think you're playing a part.

41:29.295 --> 41:30.775
Charlotte's dead.

41:32.935 --> 41:34.735
I know you feel something.

41:38.615 --> 41:41.375
I... I don't know anything.

41:42.535 --> 41:43.815
About anything.

41:45.415 --> 41:47.413
That's what a little boy would say.

41:47.415 --> 41:49.935
You've been running, hiding.

41:52.135 --> 41:54.295
Who was she, Otto?

41:55.615 --> 41:58.653
I need to make her acquaintance.

41:58.655 --> 41:59.935
She...

42:01.095 --> 42:03.093
She was abandoned

42:03.095 --> 42:04.535
at a very young age.

42:05.895 --> 42:08.015
Both her parents died.

42:18.375 --> 42:20.653
I am seeing...

42:20.655 --> 42:22.333
...a woman.

42:22.335 --> 42:23.615
She's saying...

42:25.415 --> 42:27.053
..."My love,

42:27.055 --> 42:29.295
"stop blaming yourself.

42:31.335 --> 42:35.213
"We have no need for goodbyes.

42:35.215 --> 42:37.853
"I will always be by your side.

42:37.855 --> 42:39.375
"I love you."

42:41.095 --> 42:43.653
I needed an actress for the seances.

42:43.655 --> 42:46.335
I knew her from the theatre. Well...

42:47.855 --> 42:50.213
You found a way
of making money together?

42:50.215 --> 42:53.175
Her beauty
and your theatrical flair.

42:54.855 --> 42:57.095
We were staying
at the Grand in Baden.

42:58.215 --> 43:00.175
A lot of wealthy guests there.

43:01.615 --> 43:04.173
One of the guests was a medium,

43:04.175 --> 43:07.293
a psychic, attracting attention.

43:07.295 --> 43:09.055
And that's what gave you the idea.

43:13.455 --> 43:18.653
Someone put a gun
to her chest, Otto...

43:18.655 --> 43:21.455
...close enough to feel
her last breath.

43:24.775 --> 43:26.853
He was her lover.

43:26.855 --> 43:28.973
She had men falling at her feet.

43:28.975 --> 43:30.495
This man was different.

43:31.895 --> 43:35.255
This man was the father
of her unborn child...

43:37.055 --> 43:39.735
...and he had a flair for illusion.

43:42.135 --> 43:43.895
You think it was me?

43:45.295 --> 43:47.815
You think I murdered Charlotte?!

43:49.015 --> 43:50.975
Otto!

44:10.735 --> 44:14.693
I don't have to put my fist
in someone's mouth to get the truth!

44:14.695 --> 44:16.893
People lie when they're
in a state of panic.

44:16.895 --> 44:19.493
It's a reflex like...
like the sort that children tell.

44:19.495 --> 44:22.373
You hurt him like that, you'll
scare him into saying anything!

44:22.375 --> 44:25.173
I'd prefer it if you just said,
"Thank you for intervening"!

44:25.175 --> 44:26.533
He isn't the killer!

44:26.535 --> 44:30.413
Look at him. He's scared. He knows
something that he's not telling!

44:30.415 --> 44:32.695
You asked me my opinion.

44:41.015 --> 44:44.173
Convince me. Whoever killed
Charlotte Lowenstein,

44:44.175 --> 44:46.653
he did it to save his reputation.

44:46.655 --> 44:48.813
Braun has no reputation to save.

44:48.815 --> 44:52.293
Another man was in that room,
a man of wealth and status.

44:52.295 --> 44:55.013
You asked me to help you
paint an image of the victim.

44:55.015 --> 44:57.093
I can do better, Inspector.

44:57.095 --> 44:59.335
I can paint you
an image of the killer.

45:07.655 --> 45:09.335
Come in.

45:20.935 --> 45:22.495
I'm not a fool.

45:24.135 --> 45:26.615
Don't treat me like one, Liebermann.

45:28.015 --> 45:29.535
I'm sorry, sir?

45:30.535 --> 45:32.373
The police.

45:32.375 --> 45:34.333
The thing in Leopoldstadt.

45:34.335 --> 45:36.175
Everyone is talking.

45:37.975 --> 45:40.333
You've decided to turn your back
on medicine

45:40.335 --> 45:43.173
and enrol instead
in the police force?

45:43.175 --> 45:45.293
I've been given the chance
to observe a murder case.

45:45.295 --> 45:47.173
From the point of view
of medical research...

45:47.175 --> 45:50.495
I don't like you, Liebermann!
I don't like your arrogance.

45:53.615 --> 45:57.575
You think our methods
are old, out of date.

45:59.455 --> 46:01.415
You don't even have the courtesy
to conceal it.

46:03.015 --> 46:05.453
You visit Freud's lectures
in Vienna,

46:05.455 --> 46:07.775
but you haven't the courtesy
to attend my own.

46:09.215 --> 46:11.013
Professor Freud is making
great advances...

46:11.015 --> 46:12.535
Damn it!

46:15.615 --> 46:18.653
We don't change our working
practices every time

46:18.655 --> 46:21.095
some Jewish doctor publishes a book!

46:26.655 --> 46:29.573
Never forget,
I'm senior physician here.

46:29.575 --> 46:32.653
I decide whether you remain
at this hospital.

46:32.655 --> 46:37.095
As of this moment, your tenure
is hanging by a thread.

46:47.895 --> 46:49.615
Good morning, sir.

47:03.015 --> 47:04.255
Miss Lydgate?

47:13.575 --> 47:15.935
You work at the city museum.

47:18.495 --> 47:19.695
I'm a scientist.

47:20.815 --> 47:22.775
A restorer.
Interesting.

47:24.055 --> 47:25.373
And what do you restore?

47:25.375 --> 47:29.013
Archaeological finds,
rare specimens.

47:29.015 --> 47:30.775
Why exactly am I here, Doctor?

47:32.335 --> 47:33.693
You don't remember?

47:33.695 --> 47:36.455
They say... I attacked someone.

47:37.735 --> 47:39.173
I don't recall.

47:39.175 --> 47:42.095
The mind can play tricks on us.

47:44.015 --> 47:48.975
Memories can be suppressed,
especially painful ones.

47:51.095 --> 47:55.335
Do you think I'm insane? Is that
why you've locked me up here?

47:57.375 --> 47:59.693
You were brought here
so that you could be helped.

48:01.535 --> 48:05.253
Padlocks on the gates,
bars on the windows.

48:05.255 --> 48:07.893
What manner of help is that,
exactly? Miss Lydgate...

48:07.895 --> 48:09.893
I came to Vienna to study science.

48:09.895 --> 48:11.973
I was told this city
was more enlightened.

48:11.975 --> 48:15.173
I see little evidence of it
in the way I've been treated here.

48:15.175 --> 48:17.335
Miss Lydgate...
I ask you plainly...

48:21.095 --> 48:22.855
...do you think I'm insane?

48:27.695 --> 48:29.175
No.

48:31.575 --> 48:35.373
Stefan, escort Miss Lydgate
back to the ward.

48:35.375 --> 48:37.255
I shall prepare the release papers.

48:39.255 --> 48:42.893
Come. Come with me.

48:48.855 --> 48:50.375
Calm down!

48:56.735 --> 48:58.853
Braun admits to being
her accomplice.

48:58.855 --> 49:02.213
He probably has the skills
to create the illusion.

49:02.215 --> 49:04.053
"Probably" is no good to me.

49:04.055 --> 49:06.213
I'm convinced he's keeping
something back.

49:06.215 --> 49:08.493
I'm not interested
in your speculations.

49:08.495 --> 49:10.493
Do you have enough to charge him?

49:10.495 --> 49:11.773
No, sir.

49:11.775 --> 49:15.053
Damn it! Rheinhardt, I need
to be able to rely on you!

49:15.055 --> 49:17.293
Sir...
I can't let this go on!

49:17.295 --> 49:19.573
Braun is not the killer,
Commissioner.

49:19.575 --> 49:21.373
He does not fit our...

49:21.375 --> 49:24.373
...profile.
"Profile"?

49:24.375 --> 49:27.013
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

49:27.015 --> 49:29.213
We are looking for someone
who killed her

49:29.215 --> 49:31.533
to save his reputation.
Braun has no reputation,

49:31.535 --> 49:33.813
no family name, no wedding ring.

49:33.815 --> 49:35.575
I'm only interested in proof.

49:36.655 --> 49:38.535
Do you have any?

49:40.135 --> 49:42.813
All right. Release him.

49:42.815 --> 49:45.255
And then follow him, hmm?

49:58.415 --> 50:02.533
Yes. Yes, it's me. It's Strasser.

50:02.535 --> 50:06.255
Look, I'm sorry, we didn't
make an arrest tonight.

50:07.455 --> 50:11.813
Max, the coach is here. Your father
is taking us out, remember?

50:11.815 --> 50:15.013
We're supposed to spend
the evening together.

50:15.015 --> 50:17.333
What's the matter?
Something's upset you.

50:17.335 --> 50:19.853
He's been on at you again.
About the hospital.

50:19.855 --> 50:22.133
No.
Yes. He has.

50:22.135 --> 50:25.693
I can always tell when you're lying.
Max, truly, we wouldn't care

50:25.695 --> 50:29.893
if you swept roads for a living.
We just want you to be happy.

50:29.895 --> 50:31.613
Now come on, the coach is waiting.

Good to see you again.

51:48.215 --> 51:50.453
Now I understand
your sudden interest in Mahler.

51:50.455 --> 51:52.213
These gentlemen are my friends.

51:52.215 --> 51:54.133
Besides, it's a thing
to be seen here.

51:54.135 --> 51:56.015
Rachel!

51:59.815 --> 52:04.093
Is it her? Who?
That woman. Your patient.

52:04.095 --> 52:06.533
Are you still thinking about her?

52:06.535 --> 52:07.935
Don't be silly.

52:08.895 --> 52:13.333
Perhaps you'd pay more attention to
me if I started to scream and cry.

52:13.335 --> 52:17.213
That's not funny, Clara.
If I begged you to cure me, Doctor,

52:17.215 --> 52:21.133
would you find that alluring?
Do you want to play that game?

52:21.135 --> 52:22.613
No.

52:22.615 --> 52:26.213
My friends warned me not to fall
in love with such a serious man.

52:26.215 --> 52:29.013
I should have listened to them.

52:39.935 --> 52:41.613
Ladies and gentlemen,

52:41.615 --> 52:45.133
a change to our published programme
for this evening.

52:45.135 --> 52:47.693
Owing to the illness
of our accompanist,

52:47.695 --> 52:52.295
Hofoperndirektor Gustav Mahler
will play for us.

53:10.495 --> 53:12.333
Why aren't they cheering him?

53:12.335 --> 53:14.133
Because he doesn't know his place.

53:14.135 --> 53:18.013
These men you're courting as
friends, do they know your religion,

53:18.015 --> 53:20.533
or did you conveniently
forget to mention it?

53:20.535 --> 53:23.733
That isn't even funny, Max.
It wasn't supposed to be.

53:23.735 --> 53:26.893
Can't you see their contempt for us?
They barely even bother to hide it.

53:26.895 --> 53:28.773
I did not raise my son
to talk to me this way.

53:28.775 --> 53:31.173
Don't get into an argument,
please, not tonight.

53:31.175 --> 53:33.653
You have no right to lecture me
about the people I choose to be

53:33.655 --> 53:35.453
friends with.
Enough, both of you.

53:35.455 --> 53:38.173
Clara, sorry.
What must you think of us?

53:38.175 --> 53:41.453
Now, can we please all
try to enjoy our evening?

I want to ask you something.

55:03.135 --> 55:05.733
You look very serious.

55:05.735 --> 55:07.933
What's the matter?

55:07.935 --> 55:09.733
Clara.

55:09.735 --> 55:11.773
You do... love her?

55:11.775 --> 55:13.173
What?

55:13.175 --> 55:15.573
Well, you wouldn't do anything
stupid just to please Papa.

55:15.575 --> 55:18.573
Our two families
are friends, after all.

55:18.575 --> 55:21.933
Well, we're not engaged, Leah. No,
but Clara is expecting you to ask.

55:21.935 --> 55:24.935
Don't forget, she is
my friend, too, Max.

55:28.535 --> 55:30.053
"She's bewitching."

55:30.055 --> 55:31.893
Put that back.
"But she is dark

55:31.895 --> 55:34.413
"and oddly dangerous,
a deep reservoir of anger."

55:34.415 --> 55:38.173
Those are my... "In truth,
I'm desperate to help her."

55:38.175 --> 55:41.053
Amelia? She's a patient.
Ah! Well!

55:41.055 --> 55:44.453
Now I understand the appeal
of neurology. Leah...

55:44.455 --> 55:47.773
This reads like romantic poetry. You
can't just come in here and take...

55:47.775 --> 55:50.815
It was open on the desk
and you were out. Give it... to me.

55:55.055 --> 55:58.653
We tried so hard
when we first came here,

55:58.655 --> 56:01.775
struggled to fit into
Viennese society.

56:03.575 --> 56:07.413
That's what Clara gave you, isn't
it, an introduction to a new world?

56:07.415 --> 56:10.613
That's not fair. You can't say that.

56:10.615 --> 56:12.293
Well, she knows
all the right people.

56:12.295 --> 56:14.933
You can always count on Clara
for an invitation.

56:14.935 --> 56:17.453
She's helped you find your way.

56:17.455 --> 56:20.735
But if you do not love her,
then you have to make that clear.

56:22.255 --> 56:26.213
I... have feelings for her.
Of course I do.

56:26.215 --> 56:29.535
Do you love her?
Don't lie to me, Maxim.

56:33.135 --> 56:37.055
You're deceiving her
and you're deceiving yourself.

56:38.055 --> 56:41.213
Is there a name for that
in your fancy science books?

56:41.215 --> 56:42.735
There's a policeman downstairs.

57:03.895 --> 57:08.655
No closed doors. No invisible
bullet. No tricks. No illusion.

57:09.655 --> 57:11.813
The killer's panicking.

57:11.815 --> 57:13.973
He knows we're coming.

57:13.975 --> 57:16.253
We should never have let him go.

57:16.255 --> 57:18.373
We had no way of knowing.

57:18.375 --> 57:21.573
It wasn't us he was afraid of.
He knew the lover's identity.

57:21.575 --> 57:23.453
Then why didn't he tell us?

57:23.455 --> 57:26.533
Why not admit the truth
when we had him in custody?

57:26.535 --> 57:29.013
When he was scared, he could have
asked for our protection.

57:29.015 --> 57:32.015
Here! What are these?

57:36.135 --> 57:38.095
I've seen them before.

57:42.895 --> 57:44.535
Numbers of the dead.

58:04.495 --> 58:06.413
Whoa!

58:06.415 --> 58:08.375
Steady, steady, steady.

58:13.735 --> 58:17.453
See? It's Roman for the rows,

58:17.455 --> 58:19.695
Arabic for each headstone.

58:21.015 --> 58:23.975
He made a note of all those
that were freshly turned...

58:25.655 --> 58:28.335
...all the people
who were newly deceased.

58:29.495 --> 58:31.775
A salesman looking for clients.

58:56.455 --> 58:57.975
Inspector?

59:06.055 --> 59:07.255
Inspector?

59:08.215 --> 59:10.215
Now we know their names.

59:47.535 --> 59:50.175
Were you very late at the club?

59:55.455 --> 59:57.215
Who was there?

59:58.575 --> 59:59.853
The usual crowd.

59:59.855 --> 01:00:01.293
Of course.

01:00:01.295 --> 01:00:04.053
Bruckmuller, Adler.

01:00:04.055 --> 01:00:06.375
The Mayor, also.

01:00:08.575 --> 01:00:10.415
Sir?
What?

01:00:11.735 --> 01:00:15.095
Madam. Oskar Reinhardt,
Police Department, Leopoldstadt.

01:00:29.655 --> 01:00:32.573
My good man,
is Madam von Rath at home?

01:00:32.575 --> 01:00:34.253
COUNTESS von Rath.

01:00:34.255 --> 01:00:35.935
Who wants to know?

01:00:37.095 --> 01:00:40.055
The Vienna Police, Countess.

01:00:54.935 --> 01:00:56.975
Karl Uberhorst?

01:00:59.695 --> 01:01:00.855
Yes?

01:01:01.975 --> 01:01:03.215
My wife.

01:01:05.615 --> 01:01:07.055
My Anna.

01:01:10.015 --> 01:01:12.295
My life's been empty without her.

01:01:15.335 --> 01:01:16.895
I never said goodbye.

01:01:17.855 --> 01:01:21.973
You're fools. You know nothing
about the powers that she governed.

01:01:21.975 --> 01:01:24.575
My... My sister.

01:01:25.895 --> 01:01:29.693
My twin, she... she died.

01:01:29.695 --> 01:01:33.293
That is a special bond, Inspector.

01:01:33.295 --> 01:01:38.573
I've watched her conjure up demons,
summon the voices of the dead.

01:01:38.575 --> 01:01:42.855
Fraulein Lowenstein
had a gift like no other.

01:01:51.895 --> 01:01:55.175
You visited Fraulein Lowenstein
at her salon?

01:01:56.455 --> 01:01:58.855
Not just I, Inspector.

01:02:07.295 --> 01:02:09.335
Tell me what you see, Doctor.

01:02:11.135 --> 01:02:12.455
I see desperation.

01:02:14.375 --> 01:02:16.055
Lives cut short.

01:02:17.735 --> 01:02:19.413
Broken relationships.

01:02:19.415 --> 01:02:22.373
Unfinished conversations.

01:02:22.375 --> 01:02:24.975
I see the pain of loss.

01:02:27.215 --> 01:02:28.973
And you?

01:02:28.975 --> 01:02:31.413
What do you think?
That there's no difference

01:02:31.415 --> 01:02:34.213
between your Freudian cure
and these poor souls

01:02:34.215 --> 01:02:36.535
spilling their grief
to a charlatan like her.

01:02:38.175 --> 01:02:40.973
Hands off!
Stand back, Officer!

01:02:40.975 --> 01:02:43.933
I need to talk to the Commissioner.

01:02:43.935 --> 01:02:45.455
That's what it is.

01:02:47.095 --> 01:02:50.293
What's going on here?
Please calm down, sir.

01:02:50.295 --> 01:02:53.493
Holderlein enjoys
special privileges. Sir...

01:02:53.495 --> 01:02:56.413
He donates to the Mayor's campaign.
Herr Bruckmuller...

01:02:56.415 --> 01:02:59.973
He only went to that damned seance
for his wife's sake.

01:02:59.975 --> 01:03:02.373
Why has he been detained?

01:03:02.375 --> 01:03:04.813
He's not under arrest.
He's just being questioned.

01:03:04.815 --> 01:03:08.253
We believe the killer was
wealthy, a man of standing.

01:03:08.255 --> 01:03:10.413
Holderlein was in that room
and he fits our profile.

01:03:10.415 --> 01:03:13.373
It makes him a suspect.
"Profile"?!

01:03:13.375 --> 01:03:15.453
What the hell is he talking about?

01:03:15.455 --> 01:03:17.533
It means we have
a psychological portrait

01:03:17.535 --> 01:03:22.053
of the killer. What about proof?
What about evidence?

01:03:22.055 --> 01:03:24.855
This is supposed to be
a damned police station!

01:03:26.815 --> 01:03:29.733
The Mayor won't allow his people

01:03:29.735 --> 01:03:32.693
to be mired by scandal
quite so easily.

01:03:32.695 --> 01:03:34.733
We're talking about
a murder inquiry here...

01:03:34.735 --> 01:03:38.253
We're taking about a slum-dweller
killed in the slums.

01:03:38.255 --> 01:03:41.095
You don't have any jurisdiction
here. Rheinhardt!

01:03:46.135 --> 01:03:48.775
Do you know who I am, Inspector?

01:03:50.455 --> 01:03:55.373
I own the foundries
that produce this city's steel,

01:03:55.375 --> 01:03:58.613
every tramline,
every telegraph wire,

01:03:58.615 --> 01:04:01.853
every scalpel and razor
and table knife!

01:04:01.855 --> 01:04:04.295
I built Vienna.

01:04:08.655 --> 01:04:11.095
And Holderlein leaves with me.
Gentlemen...

01:04:13.495 --> 01:04:15.495
See what you have done?

01:04:21.615 --> 01:04:25.493
He was right, of course.
All we have is supposition. No.

01:04:25.495 --> 01:04:28.013
We have more, we have much more,

01:04:28.015 --> 01:04:30.453
the detailed
psychological picture -

01:04:30.455 --> 01:04:32.573
someone intelligent,
meticulous, patient.

01:04:32.575 --> 01:04:35.773
Wonderful. We need to do this
the old-fashioned way -

01:04:35.775 --> 01:04:38.855
garner evidence, build a case
brick by brick.

01:04:41.135 --> 01:04:42.815
What?

01:04:47.935 --> 01:04:49.575
The cemetery.

01:04:50.535 --> 01:04:52.293
How is it you know it so well?

01:04:52.295 --> 01:04:53.815
There's someone you visit there?

01:04:59.895 --> 01:05:03.095
I don't want to talk about it.
But you think about it often.

01:05:16.775 --> 01:05:18.215
My daughter.

01:05:21.255 --> 01:05:23.135
My little girl.

01:05:27.095 --> 01:05:28.255
She died.

01:05:30.415 --> 01:05:31.895
I'm sorry.

01:05:37.095 --> 01:05:38.733
My wife...

01:05:38.735 --> 01:05:40.215
...she left me.

01:05:41.655 --> 01:05:43.253
Couldn't cope.

01:05:43.255 --> 01:05:46.013
If there's anything
I could do to help...

01:05:46.015 --> 01:05:49.853
No, I don't want my mind
dissected, Doctor.

01:05:49.855 --> 01:05:51.455
I need to work.

01:05:52.415 --> 01:05:53.735
Work is what I have.

01:05:55.615 --> 01:05:57.855
I will be fine
as soon as this case is solved.

01:05:58.815 --> 01:06:01.615
I need you to put me
in a room with him again.

01:06:16.535 --> 01:06:19.413
You want me to organise... what?

01:06:19.415 --> 01:06:21.493
A seance, madam.

01:06:21.495 --> 01:06:25.293
We've contacted a medium,
highly recommended, from Paris.

01:06:25.295 --> 01:06:27.133
Madame De Rougement.

01:06:27.135 --> 01:06:29.975
The French police, the Surete,
swear by her.

01:06:30.935 --> 01:06:32.575
Interesting.

01:06:39.295 --> 01:06:40.975
Heinrich?

01:06:52.135 --> 01:06:54.455
We can't afford to go.

01:06:55.895 --> 01:06:57.775
We can't afford to stay away.

01:07:13.215 --> 01:07:15.015
Hello.

01:07:17.295 --> 01:07:20.613
Nurse? I was looking
for a patient, a Miss...

01:07:20.615 --> 01:07:22.293
...Lydgate.

01:07:22.295 --> 01:07:24.735
She is with the professor
in there.

01:07:51.735 --> 01:07:53.173
Professor?

01:07:53.175 --> 01:07:55.253
I'm busy.
Please, listen to me!

01:07:55.255 --> 01:07:59.295
I'd be obliged, Liebermann,
if you'd take your hands off me.

01:08:00.655 --> 01:08:03.213
That patient is my responsibility.
I brought her to you.

01:08:03.215 --> 01:08:06.735
And you were right.
She needs urgent treatment.

01:08:08.975 --> 01:08:12.493
You can't use
these instruments of torture!

01:08:12.495 --> 01:08:15.695
Say that again
and your career is over.

01:08:38.654 --> 01:08:45.335
Join hands, my beloveds,
and let the host of spirits enter.

01:08:54.095 --> 01:08:59.453
I invoke and conjure thee,
O spirit Morax,

01:08:59.455 --> 01:09:05.375
fortified with the power
of the supreme majesty.

01:09:06.895 --> 01:09:09.813
I conjure thee!

01:09:11.895 --> 01:09:16.133
I see him. He is here.

01:09:16.135 --> 01:09:17.895
Welcome, spirit.

01:09:19.055 --> 01:09:21.933
We who live in ignorance

01:09:21.935 --> 01:09:24.055
beg you to help us.

01:09:25.255 --> 01:09:27.133
We wish to contact

01:09:27.135 --> 01:09:29.575
our sister Charlotte.

01:09:46.295 --> 01:09:48.372
I can see.

01:09:57.015 --> 01:09:59.573
Don't touch me!

01:09:59.575 --> 01:10:01.175
Don't touch me!

01:10:02.895 --> 01:10:04.615
Don't touch!

01:10:18.295 --> 01:10:21.295
Your Madame De Rougemont
was impressive.

01:10:23.015 --> 01:10:27.015
Top of the bill at the Blue Danube.
Isolde Sedlmair.

01:10:30.695 --> 01:10:33.693
Holderlein gave us nothing.
Hmm.

01:10:33.695 --> 01:10:35.815
But his wife was eloquent.

01:10:37.255 --> 01:10:39.615
She seems to think
her husband has a secret.

01:11:18.455 --> 01:11:20.255
Doctor?

01:11:23.695 --> 01:11:25.455
If I told you
I could make it stop...

01:11:27.055 --> 01:11:28.095
...all the pain...

01:11:29.655 --> 01:11:31.135
...would you do as I ask?

01:11:32.695 --> 01:11:35.295
I... I know you have
no reason to trust me.

01:11:43.135 --> 01:11:45.255
Yes.
Good.

01:11:48.135 --> 01:11:50.175
I want you to tell me about him...

01:11:53.655 --> 01:11:55.375
...the man who attacked you.

01:11:59.375 --> 01:12:01.535
I want you to describe
the moment...

01:12:02.815 --> 01:12:04.975
...without experiencing the feelings.

01:12:08.615 --> 01:12:10.295
Miss Lydgate...

01:12:14.455 --> 01:12:15.975
...Amelia...

01:12:17.415 --> 01:12:19.215
...you're completely safe here.

01:12:21.375 --> 01:12:23.855
I promise I'll take care of you.

01:12:31.255 --> 01:12:33.415
Describe the moment...

01:12:34.815 --> 01:12:37.135
...without experiencing the feelings.

01:12:41.815 --> 01:12:44.135
Just focus on the scent.

01:12:59.015 --> 01:13:02.093
Her violent episode was
triggered by a hidden memory.

01:13:02.095 --> 01:13:03.853
Thank you.

01:13:03.855 --> 01:13:05.533
But how can memories be hidden?

01:13:05.535 --> 01:13:07.293
Well, that evening
at the exhibition,

01:13:07.295 --> 01:13:09.613
I remembered a cologne.
The waiter was wearing it.

01:13:09.615 --> 01:13:11.213
And what's the connection?

01:13:11.215 --> 01:13:13.253
Same brand I smelled
in the hospital,

01:13:13.255 --> 01:13:15.413
worn by the orderly.
I believe she has

01:13:15.415 --> 01:13:19.773
a painful memory associated
with the scent of a man.

01:13:19.775 --> 01:13:23.053
You mean someone attacked her?

01:13:23.055 --> 01:13:24.533
Yes.

01:13:24.535 --> 01:13:28.333
Every time she smelled that scent,
she went into a hypermanic state.

01:13:28.335 --> 01:13:30.373
I tried to bring the memory
to the surface

01:13:30.375 --> 01:13:32.573
in order that she could
be free of it.

01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:35.133
So you're saying
you've solved the case?

01:13:35.135 --> 01:13:36.453
Your bill, sir.

01:13:36.455 --> 01:13:38.173
Yes.

01:13:38.175 --> 01:13:39.933
I... hope so.

01:13:39.935 --> 01:13:43.455
Good. Then we won't need
to keep discussing her.

01:13:46.975 --> 01:13:48.375
No response.

01:13:49.335 --> 01:13:51.055
No outburst.

01:13:52.415 --> 01:13:54.655
The patient is cured.

01:13:55.855 --> 01:13:58.053
The electro-shock therapy

01:13:58.055 --> 01:14:00.295
was entirely successful.

01:14:50.815 --> 01:14:54.853
You said the killer arranged her as
though she were an artist's model.

01:14:54.855 --> 01:14:56.853
She was in this room with her lover

01:14:56.855 --> 01:14:59.293
and somehow she took
their photograph.

01:14:59.295 --> 01:15:02.773
She needed evidence of the affair
if she was going to make him pay,

01:15:02.775 --> 01:15:06.015
and so she used a camera. Here!

01:15:14.375 --> 01:15:17.773
Charlotte was a blackmailer.
He was punishing her,

01:15:17.775 --> 01:15:21.613
doing to her
exactly what she had done to him.

01:15:21.615 --> 01:15:24.093
She made him the subject
of a portrait,

01:15:24.095 --> 01:15:29.815
and so he arranged her death
in the exact same image.

01:15:36.535 --> 01:15:38.135
Heinrich?

01:15:39.655 --> 01:15:43.135
The police... at the door again.

01:15:47.375 --> 01:15:49.413
You admit to being in her salon?

01:15:49.415 --> 01:15:53.973
I admit that my wife has
a weakness for the supernatural.

01:15:53.975 --> 01:15:56.333
And, God help me, I indulged her.

01:15:56.335 --> 01:15:58.893
Were you and the Fraulein
ever alone?

01:15:58.895 --> 01:16:00.653
You're asking if she was my lover?

01:16:00.655 --> 01:16:04.893
You think pale skin
and a petticoat would tempt me

01:16:04.895 --> 01:16:06.813
into the bed of a whore?

01:16:06.815 --> 01:16:09.413
Your wife was scared at the seance.

01:16:09.415 --> 01:16:15.213
My wife is nervous whenever I'm
within 50 feet of another woman.

01:16:15.215 --> 01:16:18.413
Doesn't make me
an adulterer, does it?

01:16:18.415 --> 01:16:20.295
There's a photograph...

01:16:21.775 --> 01:16:25.493
...the two of you together,
you and Charlotte Lowenstein.

01:16:25.495 --> 01:16:27.215
Really, Inspector?

01:16:28.695 --> 01:16:30.135
May I see it?

01:16:32.535 --> 01:16:36.293
Shall we put an end
to all these games?

01:16:36.295 --> 01:16:38.575
Are you going to charge me?

01:16:41.215 --> 01:16:42.975
Gentlemen.

01:16:48.655 --> 01:16:50.933
That was stupid.

01:16:50.935 --> 01:16:52.613
I took a gamble.

01:16:52.615 --> 01:16:55.853
I thought he might snap under
pressure. We need that picture.

01:16:55.855 --> 01:16:57.935
He would have destroyed it.

01:17:01.535 --> 01:17:04.855
There must be something,
a way to extract a confession.

01:17:06.295 --> 01:17:08.173
What about that trick of yours
you mentioned?

01:17:08.175 --> 01:17:09.813
It's not a trick.
What was it called?

01:17:09.815 --> 01:17:12.535
Hypnosis. We'll never
get him to agree.

01:17:14.015 --> 01:17:15.775
Commissioner needs you, Inspector.

01:17:23.135 --> 01:17:25.133
Why is Inspector von Bulow here?

01:17:25.135 --> 01:17:27.295
Now, don't make this difficult.

01:17:29.335 --> 01:17:30.735
You're taking me off the case.

01:17:31.695 --> 01:17:33.973
I'm extremely close to an arrest.

01:17:33.975 --> 01:17:35.453
Yes, as usual.

01:17:35.455 --> 01:17:38.973
Damn it! I warned you
not to drag in Holderlein!

01:17:38.975 --> 01:17:41.133
The Mayor's office
is baying for blood.

01:17:41.135 --> 01:17:43.415
You are relieved.

01:18:10.535 --> 01:18:12.253
What's that you've got there?

01:18:12.255 --> 01:18:14.253
They've identified the weapon.

01:18:14.255 --> 01:18:15.815
Please...

01:18:25.855 --> 01:18:29.655
Von Bulow's not here at the moment.
I'm still your commanding officer.

01:18:53.895 --> 01:18:55.335
Yes?

01:18:59.895 --> 01:19:01.775
People will start to think
we like each other.

01:19:03.495 --> 01:19:06.933
One piece of meat looks exactly
like another. Don't you see?

01:19:06.935 --> 01:19:10.333
Matthias... Matthias!
I need the offcuts.

01:19:10.335 --> 01:19:12.375
What?
The human tissue!

01:19:21.895 --> 01:19:26.255
An antique gun. Old enough
to fill with powder and shot.

01:19:27.255 --> 01:19:31.335
Don't you see? The propellant
and the bullet had to be separate.

01:19:32.815 --> 01:19:35.093
I remembered the history lesson
from school.

01:19:35.095 --> 01:19:39.453
The Austrian army,
when they ran out of munition,

01:19:39.455 --> 01:19:43.215
they packed the chambers
of their cannon with debris.

01:19:48.655 --> 01:19:51.493
A modern bullet.

01:19:51.495 --> 01:19:53.973
The charge is contained
within the casing.

01:19:53.975 --> 01:19:56.975
He needed a special kind of shot.

01:19:58.655 --> 01:20:00.255
So he needed an older weapon.

01:20:03.935 --> 01:20:07.413
Are you mad?!
What the hell are you doing?

01:20:07.415 --> 01:20:11.855
You see? Strong enough to kill her
yet leaves no traces.

01:20:15.775 --> 01:20:17.613
What is it, Doctor?

01:20:17.615 --> 01:20:21.375
Those forceps, Doctor,
who would have access to those?

01:20:24.335 --> 01:20:25.613
Bespoke.

01:20:25.615 --> 01:20:27.533
Hallmarked.

01:20:27.535 --> 01:20:29.175
Pure steel.

01:20:32.535 --> 01:20:36.133
A bullet made of tissue and bone
would have disintegrated on impact.

01:20:36.135 --> 01:20:38.173
Someone packed
the chamber of the pistol

01:20:38.175 --> 01:20:40.013
with fragments of human fibre.

01:20:40.015 --> 01:20:43.573
Forceps. Used to turn the key
from the wrong side.

01:20:43.575 --> 01:20:46.973
He jammed these into the lock and
locked the door from the outside.

01:20:46.975 --> 01:20:50.415
You reported my progress every day
to the Mayor's office.

01:20:52.135 --> 01:20:54.535
Yes. Well, obviously.

01:20:56.215 --> 01:20:58.455
And you declared your allegiance
to his campaign?

01:20:59.815 --> 01:21:02.293
What exactly is the purpose of this?

01:21:02.295 --> 01:21:05.573
Are you interrogating me?
When I arrested Braun,

01:21:05.575 --> 01:21:08.413
I told you he knew
more than he was telling.

01:21:08.415 --> 01:21:10.135
The dead woman confided in him.

01:21:11.735 --> 01:21:14.855
With whom did you share
our suspicions, Commissioner?

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:23.495
Step up! Step up! Try your luck!

01:21:24.415 --> 01:21:26.335
Come on! Try your luck!

01:21:28.255 --> 01:21:29.655
That must be him.

01:21:31.455 --> 01:21:33.933
Are you sure?
Quite sure.

01:21:33.935 --> 01:21:36.495
Hypnosis would be easier. Good luck.

01:21:46.615 --> 01:21:48.173
You got my letter.

01:21:48.175 --> 01:21:51.733
I got some unsigned note
insisting I come.

01:21:51.735 --> 01:21:57.053
But I don't understand why you'd
insist we meet here, of all places.

01:21:57.055 --> 01:22:00.455
Away from prying eyes,
people gossiping.

01:22:25.975 --> 01:22:29.373
It appears Fraulein Lowenstein
was not a talented medium.

01:22:29.375 --> 01:22:31.253
She was simply an actress.

01:22:31.255 --> 01:22:34.213
Sadly, that doesn't
surprise me, Doctor.

01:22:34.215 --> 01:22:36.133
A very attractive one.

01:22:36.135 --> 01:22:37.933
I never laid eyes on her.

01:22:37.935 --> 01:22:41.133
Your friends the Holderleins,
they knew her intimately.

01:22:41.135 --> 01:22:43.333
What's all this about, please?

01:22:43.335 --> 01:22:48.133
The key in the salon door. We know
how the trick was accomplished.

01:22:48.135 --> 01:22:51.653
Used to turn the key
from the wrong side.

01:22:51.655 --> 01:22:57.935
And a bullet made from human fibre,
so that it would apparently vanish.

01:22:58.895 --> 01:23:05.613
Fascinating, Doctor. But what's this
in aid of, this exposition?

01:23:05.615 --> 01:23:08.535
Your design and your monogram.

01:23:10.735 --> 01:23:12.653
Charlotte Lowenstein.

01:23:12.655 --> 01:23:15.933
You became her lover
and the father of her unborn child.

01:23:17.855 --> 01:23:20.853
Really, Doctor,
now that is nonsense.

01:23:20.855 --> 01:23:23.133
I know the killer.

01:23:23.135 --> 01:23:24.773
I've studied him intimately,

01:23:24.775 --> 01:23:26.933
someone with a great deal to lose

01:23:26.935 --> 01:23:28.933
and someone with
an unshakeable belief

01:23:28.935 --> 01:23:31.735
in his right to kill
in order to protect himself.

01:23:35.175 --> 01:23:36.815
Please don't.

01:23:39.015 --> 01:23:43.093
You're the architect of your own
warped morality, Herr Bruckmuller.

01:23:47.375 --> 01:23:50.095
The lives of the poor
are expendable.

01:23:55.335 --> 01:23:57.135
She wasn't even a good lover.

01:24:01.975 --> 01:24:04.493
Your madness is deeply ingrained.

01:24:04.495 --> 01:24:08.335
A-ha. You think I would make
a fine patient?

01:24:14.935 --> 01:24:18.015
Such a beautiful city,
don't you think, Doctor?

01:24:20.255 --> 01:24:24.415
What a prize!
Lueger doesn't go far enough.

01:24:26.215 --> 01:24:29.575
He will never do
what helps Vienna to survive.

01:24:32.055 --> 01:24:33.653
And what is that, exactly?

01:24:33.655 --> 01:24:36.293
To get rid of the vermin.

01:24:36.295 --> 01:24:38.053
The subversives.

01:24:38.055 --> 01:24:40.693
The intellectuals.

01:24:40.695 --> 01:24:42.815
The muck-raking journalists.

01:24:43.815 --> 01:24:46.933
It'll need a strong arm
to protect the honest folk

01:24:46.935 --> 01:24:48.935
when it all starts to unravel.

01:24:52.055 --> 01:24:53.653
You want to take over his mantle.

01:24:55.815 --> 01:24:58.895
You think you are so clever.

01:25:02.535 --> 01:25:06.133
Slippery, cunning...

01:25:06.135 --> 01:25:08.455
...like the rest of your sly race.

01:25:10.735 --> 01:25:12.575
But maybe not.

01:25:22.735 --> 01:25:24.133
Don't jump.

01:25:24.135 --> 01:25:26.935
My dear doctor, I don't intend to.

01:25:38.615 --> 01:25:41.575
I told him. I told him
it was a stupid idea!

01:26:24.255 --> 01:26:25.773
You've been shot.

01:26:25.775 --> 01:26:27.535
I realise.

01:26:29.095 --> 01:26:31.175
And I'd prefer not to be shot again.

01:26:32.455 --> 01:26:36.535
Wait for the wheel to take us down.
There's no escape for you.

01:26:40.015 --> 01:26:42.493
Nor for you...

01:26:42.495 --> 01:26:44.615
...Doctor Jew!

01:27:00.695 --> 01:27:02.615
Police. Back off!

01:27:04.255 --> 01:27:05.975
Police.

01:27:09.415 --> 01:27:11.053
Max!

01:27:11.055 --> 01:27:13.695
He's alive. You can arrest him.

01:27:15.375 --> 01:27:19.333
You almost died up there, Max.
What the hell went wrong?

01:27:19.335 --> 01:27:22.093
Nothing. It went perfectly.

01:27:22.095 --> 01:27:24.815
We got him to confess, Inspector.

01:27:27.415 --> 01:27:28.653
Your hat.

01:27:52.295 --> 01:27:55.575
I wore my new crepe de Chine.
Herr Korngold was quite taken.

01:27:58.255 --> 01:27:59.895
He proposed to me.

01:28:02.655 --> 01:28:05.575
I meet with him every so often
just to make you jealous.

01:28:08.295 --> 01:28:10.295
Max, are you even listening?

01:28:13.535 --> 01:28:15.935
What do you want from this? From us?

01:28:17.735 --> 01:28:19.853
What do you mean?
What's this about, Clara?

01:28:19.855 --> 01:28:22.095
I need to hear the truth from you.

01:28:24.015 --> 01:28:25.855
You've been drifting
away from me, and...

01:28:28.335 --> 01:28:29.775
...we can't go on as we are.

01:28:31.535 --> 01:28:33.255
Clara... Clara...

01:28:34.975 --> 01:28:37.853
...what's gotten into you?
I won't hate you.

01:28:37.855 --> 01:28:39.855
I just need to know your feelings.

01:28:45.335 --> 01:28:47.055
Would you...?

01:28:51.975 --> 01:28:53.575
Will you marry me?

01:28:56.975 --> 01:28:59.815
See? That wasn't so difficult.

01:29:09.815 --> 01:29:13.333
There is a shadow self,
a secret identity

01:29:13.335 --> 01:29:16.613
that everyone is struggling to hide.

01:29:16.615 --> 01:29:19.373
The deeper my journey
into other people's madness,

01:29:19.375 --> 01:29:21.055
the less I know myself.
