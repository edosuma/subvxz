Myname is Michael Westen.

00:02.869 --> 00:05.531
I used to be a spy until--

00:05.605 --> 00:08.096
- [ Man ] We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.
- [ Whistles ]

00:08.173 --> 00:10.574
[ Michael Narrating]
Whenyou're burned,you've got nothing--

00:10.643 --> 00:13.203
no cash, no credit, nojob history.

00:13.279 --> 00:16.407
- You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.
- Where am I?

00:16.483 --> 00:18.110
Miami.

00:18.184 --> 00:20.812
You do whatever work comes your way.

00:20.887 --> 00:23.879
- You rely on anyone who's still talking to you--
- [ Laughs ]

00:23.957 --> 00:26.482
- a trigger-happy ex-girlfriend--
- Should we shoot them?

00:26.559 --> 00:29.392

on you to the F..B.I.--

- Hey, is that your mom again?

- ifyou're desperate.
- Someone needs your help, Michael.

00:36.469 --> 00:38.835
Bottom line:
Untilyou figure out who burnedyou...

00:40.974 --> 00:42.965
you're not going anywhere.

00:46.513 --> 00:48.504
[ Michael Narrating ]
There's a good reason covert operatives...

00:48.581 --> 00:51.345
keep their work a secret
from their families.

00:51.418 --> 00:53.818
Once your family knows whatyou do,
you've got problems.

00:56.156 --> 00:58.283
- Best case, they're scared.
- [ Cell Phone Rings ]

00:58.358 --> 01:01.816
Worst case, they figure they can get
into trouble andyou'll get them out of it.

- Yeah.
- [ Nate ] Mi ke, it's your brother.

01:04.197 --> 01:09.362

- Look, man. Firstyou told me to leave.

01:40.867 --> 01:42.960
Nowyou're gonna kill me?
That doesn't even make sense.

wanted me to have it.

Oh, okay. Soyou bailed...

- Nate, is this yourway of asking

that the car is his.

03:36.082 --> 03:38.915
I've never seen you this
attached to anything, Michael.

03:38.985 --> 03:41.783
Ifmy dad left me this car,
itwas for a very good reason.

03:41.854 --> 03:45.312
He wasn't the sort of guywho would just
leave me this because he was feeling generous.

03:45.391 --> 03:48.451
I almost lost a finger putting in that air filter.
I don't think he did you any favors.

his style. Try it now.

- Fi, you don't know it's Sam.
- I know Sam's style.

04:15.955 --> 04:18.923
I thought you had an arrangement.
He tells the feds what you're up to...

04:18.992 --> 04:21.290
- tellsyou what the feds are up to.
- I'll handle it.

04:21.361 --> 04:24.819
No, no, no, no. I'd be happy
to take care of it.

04:24.897 --> 04:26.865
There's nothing like
a smashed kneecap...

to remind Sam who his friends are.

orjust protecting your friend?

05:01.567 --> 05:05.333
So there's this family.
Lebanese, I think. The Zamars.

05:05.405 --> 05:07.896
They're two brothers and a dad.

05:07.974 --> 05:11.137
They run some kind of
import-export business.

05:11.210 --> 05:14.611
So the thing is,
we became kind offriends.

- Stuff? What kind of stuff?

I get it. You needed the money.
Go on.

05:31.197 --> 05:33.631
Anyway, I-- I did 'em some favors.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.793
I'd change arrival times
on planes on the log.

05:35.868 --> 05:38.393
It's against the rules,
but it seemed like little stuff.

05:38.471 --> 05:40.405
Then last week...

05:40.473 --> 05:44.933
they told me theywanted me to leave a flight
off the log entirely, and that's serious.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.309

talk to the guys and get 'em off my back.

threatened mywife.

and walk away.

talk to 'em and--

to look for can find out a lot.

- What are you looking for?
- Hangar 1 2.

he told me that he had a private plane...

like that there.

No, of course not. They're too smart to keep
anything around that would get them busted.

dealing with, we can try to do something.

No. Ifyou call the police,
the only crimes they'll find areyours...
