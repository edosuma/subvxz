WEBVTT

00:02.628 --> 00:04.165
TONIGHT ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES
REVISITED...

00:04.165 --> 00:07.102
CHEF RAMSAY CHECKS UP ON SOME

00:07.102 --> 00:09.040
OF THE MOST CHALLENGING OWNERS
HE'S EVER MET.

00:09.040 --> 00:11.677
THAT'S WHY YOU NEED TO LISTEN
TO WHAT I SAY.

00:11.677 --> 00:13.281
THEY WERE CLUELESS...

00:13.281 --> 00:16.318
TALKING TO YOU ABOUT FOOD IS
LIKE TALKING TO A BRICK WALL.

00:16.318 --> 00:17.687
STUBBORN...

00:17.687 --> 00:19.023
IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF IT'S FROZEN OR NOT!

00:19.023 --> 00:21.059
IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF IT'S FROZEN OR NOT?
NO!

00:21.059 --> 00:22.327
AND OUT OF CONTROL.

00:22.327 --> 00:24.666
SHUT YOUR FACE!

00:24.666 --> 00:26.735
FIRST, CHEF RAMSAY VISITS
LA GALLERIA 33

00:26.735 --> 00:30.000
IN BOSTON'S NORTH END
WHERE SISTERS RITA AND LISA

00:30.000 --> 00:30.040
IN BOSTON'S NORTH END
WHERE SISTERS RITA AND LISA

00:30.040 --> 00:31.609
HAD LOST A GRIP
ON THE RESTAURANT.

00:31.609 --> 00:33.446
HE JUST DROPPED THE CHICKEN
ON THE FLOOR

00:33.446 --> 00:34.781
AND PUT IT BACK IN THE PAN.

00:34.781 --> 00:36.217
AND WHERE LISA WAS READY

00:36.217 --> 00:37.720
TO WALK OUT THE DOOR.

00:37.720 --> 00:39.757
YOU WALK OUT,
I'M OUT.

00:39.757 --> 00:41.292
NEXT, CHEF RAMSAY VISITS
THE OLDE HITCHING POST

00:41.292 --> 00:43.664
IN HANSON, MASSACHUSETTS
TO CHECK

00:43.664 --> 00:45.232
ON WHETHER HARD-HEADED OWNER TOM

00:45.232 --> 00:48.137
HAS FULFILLED HIS PROMISE
TO HAND OVER THE RESTAURANT

00:48.137 --> 00:49.204
TO HIS DAUGHTER ANDREA.

00:51.542 --> 00:54.080
I'M LEAVING.
OKAY.

00:54.080 --> 00:56.149
AND LASTLY HE TRAVELS
TO EVERETT, WASHINGTON

00:56.149 --> 00:58.287
TO GET AN UPDATE
ON PROHIBITION GASTROPUB,

00:58.287 --> 01:00.000
WHERE OWNER RISHI BROWN SEEMED
MORE FOCUS ON HER BELLY DANCING

01:00.000 --> 01:03.094
WHERE OWNER RISHI BROWN SEEMED
MORE FOCUS ON HER BELLY DANCING

01:03.094 --> 01:04.096
THAN RUNNING
HER RESTAURANT.

01:04.096 --> 01:06.132
YOU ARE KIDDING ME.

01:06.132 --> 01:08.002
GET READY
FOR SURPRISING UPDATES...

01:08.002 --> 01:09.571
OH, NO.

01:09.571 --> 01:11.039
AS WE FIND OUT WHICH OWNERS

01:11.039 --> 01:12.042
HAVE STAYED ON THE PATH
TO SUCCESS...

01:12.042 --> 01:13.712
GREAT NEWS!

01:13.712 --> 01:15.447
AND WHICH OWNERS ARE BACK
ON THE ROAD TO DISASTER.

01:15.447 --> 01:18.553
OH, MY GOD. IT'S HAPPENING!
OH, MY GOD.

01:20.522 --> 01:22.092
WHAT IS THAT?

01:22.092 --> 01:24.061
YOU'RE SERVING ROTTEN FOOD.

01:24.061 --> 01:25.230
THEY'RE NOT CRAP,
AND THEY'RE DELICIOUS.

01:25.230 --> 01:27.133
THEN WAKE UP!
YOU WAKE UP!

01:27.133 --> 01:29.104
SHUT THE PLACE DOWN!

01:29.104 --> 01:30.000
- GET OUT OF HERE!
- THAT IS AMAZING.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.507
- GET OUT OF HERE!
- THAT IS AMAZING.

01:31.507 --> 01:34.211
HOW EMBARRASSING!

01:34.211 --> 01:36.216
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

01:38.184 --> 01:40.322
FROM THE FIRST SECOND
I LEAVE A RESTAURANT

01:40.322 --> 01:41.590
ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES,

01:41.590 --> 01:43.059
I'M ALWAYS WONDERING
HOW THEY'LL FARE.

01:43.059 --> 01:46.031
TONIGHT, WE WILL SEE HOW THE
RESTAURANTS I VISITED LAST YEAR

01:46.031 --> 01:49.202
ARE DOING, AND, TRUST ME,
YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT I FOUND.

01:49.202 --> 01:52.141
FIRST UP,
LA GALLERIA 33 IN BOSTON.

01:54.210 --> 01:57.416
BOSTON'S NORTH END,
HOME TO LA GALLERIA 33

01:57.416 --> 01:59.720
AND THESE TWO CRAZY SISTERS.

01:59.720 --> 02:00.000
RITA...

02:00.000 --> 02:00.755
RITA...

02:00.755 --> 02:02.591
GO TALK TO THE CUSTOMERS.

02:02.591 --> 02:04.661
GO ENTERTAIN THEM WHILE THEY'RE
WAITING FOR THE  FOOD.

02:04.661 --> 02:07.265
AND LISA.
ROSA, GO DO SOMETHING.

02:07.265 --> 02:08.400
THAT'S MY SPOT.

02:08.400 --> 02:11.639
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING,
THEY WERE TROUBLE.

02:11.639 --> 02:15.178
I'M PRETTY SURE THIS IS WHAT
A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN FEELS LIKE.

02:15.178 --> 02:17.248
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE
ON HOW TO RUN A RESTAURANT.

02:17.248 --> 02:20.220
I MEAN, YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
HOW THE STAFF BEHAVED.

02:20.220 --> 02:22.123
ROSA,
COULD YOU NOT DO THAT?

02:22.123 --> 02:23.191
THANKS.
SHE TOLD ME TO SWEEP.

02:23.191 --> 02:24.360
SHE'S SWEEPING, LISA.

02:24.360 --> 02:25.496
SHE'S SWEEPING IT ON ME,
THOUGH!

02:25.496 --> 02:26.663
DON'T SWEEP IT ON MY SISTER,
CINDERELLA.

02:26.663 --> 02:28.433
I HATE YOU.

02:28.433 --> 02:30.000
ONCE I MET THESE TWO SISTERS...
LISA.

02:30.000 --> 02:30.403
ONCE I MET THESE TWO SISTERS...
LISA.

02:30.403 --> 02:31.405
NICE TO MEET YOU.
LISA, NICE TO SEE YOU.

02:31.405 --> 02:32.841
I'M RITA.
RITA.

02:32.841 --> 02:35.144
I COULD TELL THEY WERE GOING
TO BE A HANDFUL.

02:35.144 --> 02:36.413
I THINK HE SAID WATER,
SARAH, HONEY.

02:37.714 --> 02:39.151
OH, I'M SORRY.
WATER, PLEASE.

02:39.151 --> 02:40.253
NO TO THE WINE.
A LITTLE BIT TOO EARLY FOR ME.

02:40.253 --> 02:41.286
WOW.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.157
NEVER TOO EARLY.

02:43.157 --> 02:44.427
IT IS.

02:44.427 --> 02:45.427
LISA LOVES WINE.

02:45.427 --> 02:47.431
SHE LIKES TO DRINK.

02:47.431 --> 02:50.135
I SMOKE,
AND SHE DRINKS.

02:50.135 --> 02:52.471
I MEAN, SINCE WE'RE AIRING
MY DIRTY LAUNDRY--

02:52.471 --> 02:54.375
OH, I'LL LET AIR HER OWN.
CUT THAT OUT.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.245
DON'T SAY THAT SHE DRINKS.
LISA'S GREAT.

02:56.245 --> 02:58.182
THEY TOLD ME THEIR PARENTS
OWN A RESTAURANT AS WELL.

02:58.182 --> 02:59.451
OH, YOUR MUM AND DAD
HAVE A RESTAURANT?

02:59.451 --> 03:00.000
YUP. FIVE DOORS UP.
IN BOSTON?

03:00.000 --> 03:00.852
YUP. FIVE DOORS UP.
IN BOSTON?

03:00.852 --> 03:02.188
YES.
RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET.

03:02.188 --> 03:03.190
DIAGONALLY.

03:03.190 --> 03:04.491
YOU'RE KIDDING ME?

03:04.491 --> 03:07.196
SAME MENU.
I DIDN'T GET IT.

03:07.196 --> 03:08.799
AND RITA'S EX-HUSBAND
IS THE CHEF.

03:08.799 --> 03:10.268
SAY THAT AGAIN?

03:10.268 --> 03:12.304
I WAS MARRIED TO HIM.

03:12.304 --> 03:13.506
SOUNDS LIKE A SOAP OPERA.

03:13.506 --> 03:16.478
YES.
OH, BOY. OKAY.

03:16.478 --> 03:18.282
IT WAS TIME TO TRY THE FOOD.

03:18.282 --> 03:19.883
I'M SARAH.
SARAH, NICE TO SEE YOU,
DARLING.

03:19.883 --> 03:21.252
VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

03:21.252 --> 03:24.090
MY SERVER,
SHE DIDN'T HOLD BACK,

03:24.090 --> 03:25.493
AND SHE CERTAINLY WASN'T
A FAN OF RITA AND LISA.

03:25.493 --> 03:28.231
THERE IS NO ORGANIZATION
AT ALL.

03:28.231 --> 03:30.000
WOW.
NOT HERE. NOT IN THE KITCHEN.

03:30.000 --> 03:30.233
WOW.
NOT HERE. NOT IN THE KITCHEN.

03:30.233 --> 03:31.735
NOWHERE.
WOW. THAT'S NOT GOOD.

03:31.735 --> 03:33.306
WHY DID SHE SAY THAT?

03:33.306 --> 03:34.707
'CAUSE SHE'S AN IMBECILE.

03:34.707 --> 03:36.109
SKANK.

03:36.109 --> 03:37.179
FROZEN GNOCCHI.

03:37.179 --> 03:38.480
FROZEN MEATBALL.

03:38.480 --> 03:40.483
VEAL PARADISO.

03:40.483 --> 03:42.721
OH, COME ON.
WOW.

03:42.721 --> 03:44.190
IT'S LIKE SOMEONE'S THROWN UP
ON MY PLATE.

03:44.190 --> 03:45.625
GROSS.

03:45.625 --> 03:47.162
THEY CALL THIS ITALIAN FOOD?

03:47.162 --> 03:49.197
AND THEY WONDER WHY BUSINESS
IS DOWN?

03:49.197 --> 03:51.367
THERE'S A MICHELIN CHEF IN HERE
RIPPIN' OUR FOOD APART,

03:51.367 --> 03:54.773
AND YOU GUYS ARE GIGGLIN' AWAY,
AND I'M ABOUT TO THROW UP.

03:55.741 --> 03:58.145
RITA WAS FREAKING OUT.
OH, GOD.

03:58.145 --> 03:59.314
BUT SHE HAD EVERY REASON TO.

03:59.314 --> 04:00.000
LET'S JUST PRAY
THAT HE EATS THOSE--

04:00.000 --> 04:02.253
LET'S JUST PRAY
THAT HE EATS THOSE--

04:02.253 --> 04:03.555
PRAY?
WE'RE, LIKE, BEYOND PRAY.

04:03.555 --> 04:06.293
I JUST WANT SOMEBODY TO KILL ME
AT THIS POINT.

04:06.293 --> 04:08.128
THIS IS TOO MUCH.

04:08.128 --> 04:10.733
WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR DINNER,
I COULDN'T BELIEVE

04:10.733 --> 04:12.269
WHAT I WAS SEEING WHEN I WALKED
THROUGH THE DOOR.

04:12.269 --> 04:15.706
RITA WAS ARGUING WITH CUSTOMERS.

04:15.706 --> 04:16.776
THIS IS YOUR PLATE.
YES.

04:16.776 --> 04:17.778
I TOOK IT RIGHT
FROM THE WAITER.

04:17.778 --> 04:19.213
YEAH.
I KNOW IT'S MY PLATE.

04:19.213 --> 04:20.883
AND I STUCK MY FINGER--
HE TRIED IT TOO--

04:20.883 --> 04:22.152
THE ONE THAT SHE HANDED TO ME
TO EAT WAS COLD.

04:22.152 --> 04:23.319
THEY'RE ALL HOT.

04:23.319 --> 04:25.591
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

04:25.591 --> 04:27.226
THEY WEREN'T HOT TO US.

04:27.226 --> 04:28.795
SO THEY WERE COLD
WHEN THEY GOT HERE,

04:28.795 --> 04:30.000
AND THEY GOT HOT
WHEN THEY CAME BACK?

04:30.000 --> 04:30.331
AND THEY GOT HOT
WHEN THEY CAME BACK?

04:30.331 --> 04:32.235
I WAS IN ABSOLUTE DISBELIEF.

04:32.235 --> 04:33.904
SHE WAS REALLY ARGUING
WITH THEM!

04:33.904 --> 04:35.607
THEY'RE ALL HOT,
SO I'M JUST WONDERING--

04:35.607 --> 04:37.176
OH, MY GOD.

04:37.176 --> 04:38.711
JUST WHEN I THOUGHT
IT COULDN'T GET ANY WORSE,

04:38.711 --> 04:43.218
I SAW CHEF DOUG DROP A PIECE
OF CHICKEN ON THE FLOOR,

04:43.218 --> 04:45.589
THEN PICK IT UP
AND COOKED IT.

04:45.589 --> 04:47.359
YOU JUST DROPPED THAT
ON THE FLOOR.

04:47.359 --> 04:48.294
YEAH.

04:48.294 --> 04:50.297
YOU CAN'T COOK IT.

04:50.297 --> 04:51.766
YOU JUST DROPPED IT
ON THE FLOOR.

04:51.766 --> 04:53.802
I KNOW.
BUT WHEN I BROUGHT IT

04:53.802 --> 04:55.205
TO THEIR ATTENTION...

04:55.205 --> 04:56.708
UH, RITA, LISA.
HELLO? WHAT?

04:56.708 --> 04:58.677
HE JUST DROPPED THE CHICKEN
ON THE FLOOR

04:58.677 --> 05:00.000
AND PUT IT BACK IN THE PAN.

05:00.000 --> 05:00.648
AND PUT IT BACK IN THE PAN.

05:00.648 --> 05:02.316
WAIT A MINUTE.
THIS ONE HERE.

05:02.316 --> 05:04.821
THESE SISTERS JUST WANTED
TO MAKE EXCUSES.

05:04.821 --> 05:06.857
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE DOES,
BUT THIS IS DISGUSTING.

05:06.857 --> 05:08.226
BUT HE'S NOT SERVING IT.

05:08.226 --> 05:09.395
WHY ARE YOU WIPING HIS ASS?

05:09.395 --> 05:11.164
I'M NOT, BUT I DON'T WANT
TO BE PORTRAYED

05:11.164 --> 05:12.199
AS A RESTAURANT
WHO SERVES CHICKEN

05:12.199 --> 05:13.234
THAT'S BEEN DROPPED
ON THE FLOOR.

05:13.234 --> 05:14.236
I TRIED TO STOP HIM
FROM DOING IT.

05:14.236 --> 05:15.372
I DON'T KNOW. HE'S NUTS.

05:15.372 --> 05:19.178
OH,  ME.

05:19.178 --> 05:21.414
NEXT THING I KNEW,
LISA DIDN'T WANT TO BE BOTHERED

05:21.414 --> 05:23.617
WITH ANY OF THE PROBLEMS
THAT I WAS POINTING OUT.

05:23.617 --> 05:25.321
I GOT TO GET THE
OUT OF HERE.

05:25.321 --> 05:26.523
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

05:26.523 --> 05:28.225
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

05:28.225 --> 05:29.261
HE'S A DOUCHE BAG.
HE DOESN'T WANT TO HELP US.

05:29.261 --> 05:30.000
HE DOESN'T CARE.

05:30.000 --> 05:30.295
HE DOESN'T CARE.

05:30.295 --> 05:31.830
I'M OUT OF HERE.

05:34.436 --> 05:36.204
YOU GO, I'M GOING.

05:36.204 --> 05:37.373
I DIDN'T SIGN UP FOR THIS.

05:37.373 --> 05:38.876
I DON'T GIVE A
WHAT YOU SIGN--

05:38.876 --> 05:40.245
MR. RAMSAY--
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING--

05:40.245 --> 05:41.680
I DIDN'T SIGN UP FOR THIS.
YOU WALK OUT, I'M OUT.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.618
- NONE OF YOU GIVE A.
- THAT'S.

05:43.618 --> 05:44.819
IF YOU TAKE OFF,
I'M GOING AS WELL.

05:44.819 --> 05:46.354
YOU GO, I GO.

05:46.354 --> 05:48.426
LISA FINALLY CAME TO HER SENSES

05:48.426 --> 05:50.361
AND REALIZED
SHE NEEDED MY HELP.

05:50.361 --> 05:51.496
I DO GIVE A--

05:51.496 --> 05:53.467
SO, IF YOU GAVE A ,
THEN YOU'D STAY

05:53.467 --> 05:54.768
AND ACTUALLY SHOW
SOME WILLING.

05:54.768 --> 05:55.770
I CAME TO HELP.

05:55.770 --> 05:56.772
OKAY, I'M JUST GONNA HAVE

05:56.772 --> 05:59.376
A GLASS OF WINE.

05:59.376 --> 06:00.000
WE CAN FIX IT.
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.945
WE CAN FIX IT.
IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

06:00.945 --> 06:02.380
I'M HERE TO HELP.
I KNOW.

06:02.380 --> 06:04.318
AND AT TIMES YOU THINK I'M NOT.
I'M HERE TO HELP.

06:04.318 --> 06:05.318
NO. I KNOW YOU ARE.
I KNOW YOU ARE.

06:05.318 --> 06:06.855
BUT I'M NOT GONNA PUT
A BAND-AID ON IT.

06:06.855 --> 06:08.358
A BAND-AID'S NOT GONNA KEEP
THIS BUSINESS OPEN.

06:08.358 --> 06:09.459
NO.
NO, IT WON'T.

06:09.459 --> 06:11.362
NO.

06:11.362 --> 06:14.267
THE NEXT DAY, I DECIDED
FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS

06:14.267 --> 06:15.368
WAS A STAFF MEETING.

06:15.368 --> 06:17.940
FIRST TIME EVER
FOR THIS RESTAURANT.

06:17.940 --> 06:20.443
TODAY IS ALL ABOUT MOVING
FORWARD AND CHANGING.

06:20.443 --> 06:23.282
BOY, WERE LISA AND RITA READY.

06:23.282 --> 06:24.450
THEY WEREN'T HOLDING BACK.

06:24.450 --> 06:26.353
ROSA, YOU'RE A LITTLE SLOTH.

06:26.353 --> 06:30.000
JOE, WHEN I ASK YOU TO DO
SOMETHING LIKE WASH A WINDOW,

06:30.000 --> 06:31.595
JOE, WHEN I ASK YOU TO DO
SOMETHING LIKE WASH A WINDOW,

06:31.595 --> 06:33.432
YOU KNOW THAT HE'S...

06:35.434 --> 06:37.472
MIGUEL, YOU SCRATCH YOUR
IN THE DINING ROOM.

06:37.472 --> 06:40.743
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ME A BAD
WAITER, SCRATCHING MY.

06:40.743 --> 06:41.880
COME ON.
WOW.

06:41.880 --> 06:43.548
THEY HAD A LOT TO SAY.

06:43.548 --> 06:45.417
THIS IS WHAT I SEE
WHEN I WALK IN.

06:45.417 --> 06:49.224
YOU'RE SITTING THERE, SARAH,
CHITCHAT AND DRINKIN' COFFEE

06:49.224 --> 06:51.260
AND LOOKIN' MISERABLE.
WHOSE FAULT IS THAT AFTER ALL?

06:51.260 --> 06:52.263
YOURS!

06:52.263 --> 06:53.330
NO!
IT'S YOURS!

06:53.330 --> 06:55.267
IT IS NOT MY FAULT.

06:55.267 --> 06:57.938
THIS BUSINESS, NUMBER ONE,
IS NOT UNDER MY NAME.

06:57.938 --> 06:59.340
IT'S UNDER BOTH OF YOUR NAMES.

06:59.340 --> 07:00.000
THAT'S WHY YOU NEED TO LISTEN
TO WHAT I SAY.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.679
THAT'S WHY YOU NEED TO LISTEN
TO WHAT I SAY.

07:02.679 --> 07:05.850
FINALLY, RITA AND LISA WERE
STANDING UP TO THEIR STAFF.

07:05.850 --> 07:07.654
I'M TAKING CONTROL BACK TODAY.

07:07.654 --> 07:11.427
THESE TWO SISTERS WERE NOW
COMMITTED TO MOVING FORWARD.

07:11.427 --> 07:13.262
NEXT, I HAD TO TACKLE
THE FOOD.

07:13.262 --> 07:14.731
JUST HAVE A LITTLE GATHER
OVER THERE.

07:14.731 --> 07:16.335
OH, MY GOD.

07:16.335 --> 07:18.405
- LOOK AT THAT.
- THANK GOD.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.608
I INTRODUCED SMALL PLATES...
DID YOU TASTE THAT?

07:20.608 --> 07:21.910
IT'S AMAZING, ISN'T IT?
OH, MY GOD.

07:24.014 --> 07:26.451
AND MODERNIZED
THEIR DINING ROOM.

07:26.451 --> 07:28.454
- RIGHT.
- OH, THIS IS SO NICE.

07:28.454 --> 07:29.455
IT'S CLEAN.

07:29.455 --> 07:30.000
OH, MY GOD.

07:30.000 --> 07:30.525
OH, MY GOD.

07:30.525 --> 07:32.660
I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE
OUR OWN IDENTITY

07:32.660 --> 07:33.696
AS A RESTAURANT NOW.

07:33.696 --> 07:35.465
I FEEL LIKE IT'S US.

07:35.465 --> 07:38.571
I'M EXCITED TO WORK HERE AND BE
HERE, AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

07:38.571 --> 07:40.975
IT WAS TIME FOR THE RE-LAUNCH,
AND LISA...

07:40.975 --> 07:42.277
HELLO.
HOW ARE YOU?

07:42.277 --> 07:43.345
CAN I HAVE YOUR NAME?
MENDOZA.

07:43.345 --> 07:44.948
AND RITA REALLY STEPPED UP.

07:44.948 --> 07:48.653
FIRE TWO SPECIALS, A LARGE
GNOCCHI, AND A VEAL OSSOBUCO.

07:48.653 --> 07:50.324
THEY SHOWED
SUCH GREAT ENTHUSIASM

07:50.324 --> 07:52.426
BY TAKING CONTROL
OF THEIR STAFF.

07:52.426 --> 07:53.495
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY,
SEND IT OUT.

07:53.495 --> 07:54.631
- YOU READY?
- TAKE THIS ONE.

07:54.631 --> 07:55.665
THANK YOU.

07:55.665 --> 07:57.401
MAKING SURE
CUSTOMERS WERE HAPPY.

07:57.401 --> 07:58.469
WOW, THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

07:58.469 --> 07:59.839
THIS IS AMAZING.

07:59.839 --> 08:00.000
AND THEIR FOOD
WAS EXECUTED PROPERLY.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.442
AND THEIR FOOD
WAS EXECUTED PROPERLY.

08:02.442 --> 08:03.511
I THINK THAT'S EVERYTHING.

08:03.511 --> 08:04.513
OKAY.
BEAUTIFUL.

08:04.513 --> 08:06.349
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THANK YOU.

08:06.349 --> 08:07.852
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

08:07.852 --> 08:11.658
THESE SISTERS ARE TRULY,
AND I MEAN TRULY, UNIQUE.

08:11.658 --> 08:12.793
I'LL STAND HERE.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.562
WHAT?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

08:14.562 --> 08:16.733
- YOU HAVE TWO ARMS.
- UH-OH..

08:16.733 --> 08:18.502
I HAD SUCH A HARD TIME
SAYING GOOD-BYE.

08:18.502 --> 08:19.505
GORDON!

08:19.505 --> 08:20.706
CHEF RAMSAY!

08:20.706 --> 08:23.711
CHEF RAMSAY!
YOU CAN'T GO.

08:23.711 --> 08:25.647
I CANNOT STAY.
YOU CAN STAY!

08:25.647 --> 08:26.783
I--
JUST LIKE--

08:26.783 --> 08:27.950
JUST 20 MORE MINUTES.

08:27.950 --> 08:29.320
I CAN'T STAY 20 MORE MINUTES.

08:29.320 --> 08:30.000
JUST ONE OSSOBUCO MORE.

08:30.000 --> 08:30.522
JUST ONE OSSOBUCO MORE.

08:30.522 --> 08:31.957
I CAN'T.

08:31.957 --> 08:33.527
COMING UP...

08:33.527 --> 08:34.696
I SEE HIM!
OH, COME ON.

08:34.696 --> 08:36.798
CHEF RAMSAY IS BACK IN BOSTON...

08:36.798 --> 08:38.336
LISA? RITA?
LISA AND RITA!

08:38.336 --> 08:40.304
- OH, MY GOD.
- HOLY.

08:40.304 --> 08:41.473
TO FIND OUT HOW RITA AND LISA
ARE DOING.

08:41.473 --> 08:43.009
WANT TO SEE MY MOONSHINE?
YOUR MOONSHINE?

08:43.009 --> 08:44.645
HAVE THEY EMBRACED THE CHANGES?

08:44.645 --> 08:46.381
- WOW.
- OR HAVE THEY GONE BACK

08:46.381 --> 08:48.351
TO THEIR SLOPPY OLD WAYS?

08:48.351 --> 08:49.886
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S HAPPENING!

08:49.886 --> 08:52.390
OH, MY GOD.

09:01.121 --> 09:03.091
OH, WHERE IS HE?
WHERE IS HE?

09:03.091 --> 09:04.092
FANTASTIC.
THANK YOU.

09:04.092 --> 09:05.495
I'M SWEATIN' LIKE A PIG.

09:05.495 --> 09:06.762
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE GORDON.

09:06.762 --> 09:08.133
I'M SO EXCITED.

09:08.133 --> 09:10.803
I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO CONTAIN MYSELF.

09:10.803 --> 09:13.608
I'M GONNA TRY, BUT WE'LL SEE.

09:13.608 --> 09:15.244
RITA. LISA.

09:15.244 --> 09:18.649
I SEE HIM!

09:18.649 --> 09:21.086
OH, COME ON.

09:21.086 --> 09:21.787
MWAH.
HOW ARE YOU, DARLING?

09:21.787 --> 09:23.224
ARE YOU WELL?
I'M WONDERFUL.

09:23.224 --> 09:24.392
I'M WONDERFUL.
OH, MY GOODNESS.

09:24.392 --> 09:25.827
MWAH.
I FOUND HIM.

09:25.827 --> 09:26.128
MWAH.
I FOUND HIM.

09:26.128 --> 09:27.197
GOOD TO SEE YOU BOTH.
ARE YOU WELL?

09:27.197 --> 09:28.232
I FOUND HIM. I FOUND HIM.
YEAH, WE'RE DOING GREAT.

09:28.232 --> 09:29.200
MAN, TRAFFIC'S CRAZY OUT THERE.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.368
I KNOW.
SO I HEARD.

09:30.368 --> 09:31.436
IT'S NICE TO BE BACK.

09:31.436 --> 09:33.072
THE PLACE LOOKS AMAZING.

09:33.072 --> 09:34.108
- NICE AND BUSY, WHICH IS NICE.
- YEAH.

09:34.108 --> 09:35.577
BEEN BUSY, SO--
WE HAVE BEEN BUSY.

09:35.577 --> 09:39.217
SINCE BEING ON THE SHOW, MOST OF
THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN POSITIVE.

09:39.217 --> 09:40.450
THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE BACKLASH

09:40.450 --> 09:41.787
'CAUSE I CALLED CHEF RAMSAY
A DOUCHE BAG.

09:41.787 --> 09:43.156
PAT.
HOW ARE YOU?

09:43.156 --> 09:44.391
YOU DOING WELL?

09:44.391 --> 09:45.526
OH, GOOD.
HAS HE BEEN PROMOTED?

09:45.526 --> 09:46.663
DOES HE HAVE ANOTHER TITLE?

09:46.663 --> 09:48.097
WELL, HE'S GIVEN HIMSELF--

09:48.097 --> 09:49.365
THE OTHER DAY HE WAS TELLING
PEOPLE HE WAS THE OWNER.

09:49.365 --> 09:51.102
WHAT ARE YOU HERE?

09:51.102 --> 09:52.103
EVERYTHING.

09:52.103 --> 09:53.539
I'M, LIKE, MANAGER SLASH--

09:53.539 --> 09:55.442
OH, SO YOU'RE THE MANAGER?

09:55.442 --> 09:55.827
RITA?
YES?

09:55.827 --> 09:57.413
RITA?
YES?

09:57.413 --> 09:58.781
IS PAT SERIOUS?
GENERAL MANAGER?

09:58.781 --> 10:01.620
HE IS THE BUS BOY.

10:01.620 --> 10:02.621
I JUST ASSUME THEIR ROLE.

10:02.621 --> 10:03.689
HE'S THE OWNER NOW?

10:03.689 --> 10:04.857
HE'S THE OWNER.

10:04.857 --> 10:06.127
HONESTLY.

10:06.127 --> 10:07.495
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA GET WITH PAT.

10:07.495 --> 10:09.665
YOU NEED, LIKE, SEVEN SCIENTISTS
TO FIGURE HIM OUT.

10:09.665 --> 10:12.103
HEY.
HOW ARE YOU, BUD?

10:12.103 --> 10:13.172
YOU WELL?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

10:13.172 --> 10:14.240
YOU GOOD?

10:14.240 --> 10:15.542
YEAH.
IS HE WORKING HARD?

10:15.542 --> 10:17.179
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
THE HEART HAS.

10:17.179 --> 10:18.880
THE HEART HAS? WHAT?
YOU GUYS ARE BACK TOGETHER?

10:18.880 --> 10:20.384
NO, NO.
THAT'S AMAZING.

10:20.384 --> 10:21.418
NO, NO, NO, NO.
OH, YOU'RE NOT BACK TOGETHER.

10:21.418 --> 10:23.154
THE PASSION FOR THE FOOD.
OKAY.

10:23.154 --> 10:24.390
LET'S BEND DOWN TOGETHER

10:24.390 --> 10:25.827
JUST IN CASE THERE'S ANY CHICKEN
ON THE FLOOR.

10:25.827 --> 10:26.159
JUST IN CASE THERE'S ANY CHICKEN
ON THE FLOOR.

10:29.664 --> 10:32.203
YOU CAN'T COOK IT.

10:32.203 --> 10:33.738
YOU JUST DROPPED IT
ON THE FLOOR.

10:33.738 --> 10:35.608
I KNOW.

10:35.608 --> 10:37.110
OH, NO.

10:37.110 --> 10:38.112
THERE'S NO CHICKEN
ON THE FLOOR.

10:38.112 --> 10:39.114
NO.

10:39.114 --> 10:40.650
SHE--WHAT IS THAT?

10:40.650 --> 10:41.651
THAT'S ME ON THE FLOOR
DRESSED AS A CHICKEN--

10:41.651 --> 10:42.853
WHAT?

10:42.853 --> 10:44.154
SO HE NEVER FORGETS
THE FIASCO!

10:44.154 --> 10:46.893
DOUGLAS CAUSED
THAT WHOLE  FIASCO

10:46.893 --> 10:49.297
WHEN HE DID THAT WHOLE SPIEL
WITH THE CHICKEN.

10:49.297 --> 10:53.202
I WAS REALLY MAD, SO I PUT
A PICTURE UP ON THE WALL OF ME

10:53.202 --> 10:55.827
DRESSED AS A CHICKEN,
THROWN ON THE FLOOR,

10:55.827 --> 10:56.274
DRESSED AS A CHICKEN,
THROWN ON THE FLOOR,

10:56.274 --> 10:57.610
SO HE NEVER FORGETS
WHAT HE DID.

10:57.610 --> 10:59.179
I THINK IT'S NICE
THAT RITA

10:59.179 --> 11:01.517
CAN MAKE LIGHT
OF THE  SITUATION.

11:01.517 --> 11:04.422
I'M NOT--YOU KNOW, I DON'T--
I WOULDN'T--

11:04.422 --> 11:06.559
I DON'T DRESS UP AS THINGS.

11:06.559 --> 11:07.926
I'LL LEAVE THE DRESSING UP
TO RITA.

11:07.926 --> 11:09.898
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
EXCELLENT.

11:09.898 --> 11:11.866
RIGHT, LET'S CATCH UP
WITH THE TWO GIRLS.

11:11.866 --> 11:14.171
THINGS HAVE BEEN REALLY GOOD
SINCE CHEF RAMSAY LEFT.

11:14.171 --> 11:16.674
I THINK EVERYBODY'S ATTITUDE
HAS CHANGED.

11:16.674 --> 11:18.912
DOUGLAS IS BEING
MUCH MORE CREATIVE.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.147
I'M MORE MOTIVATED.

11:20.147 --> 11:21.916
RITA'S STILL RITA,
BUT THAT'S OKAY.

11:21.916 --> 11:25.155
ALL RIGHT.
FIRST OF ALL, WHO'S IN CHARGE?

11:25.155 --> 11:25.827
WE ARE.

11:25.827 --> 11:26.490
WE ARE.

11:26.490 --> 11:27.659
YEAH.

11:27.659 --> 11:29.362
I HAVE A BETTER RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE STAFF

11:29.362 --> 11:31.366
'CAUSE IT'S MORE--LIKE, BEFORE
THEY DIDN'T REALLY RESPECT US

11:31.366 --> 11:32.467
OR WHAT WE SAID...
YEAH.

11:32.467 --> 11:34.237
AND NOW I FEEL
LIKE WE'RE LEADERS.

11:34.237 --> 11:35.505
THERE'S ALWAYS HICCUPS--

11:35.505 --> 11:36.540
YOU KNOW, I GOT RID
OF ALL THE RIFFRAFF, RIGHT?

11:36.540 --> 11:37.908
TELL ME HOW YOU GOT RID
OF THE RIFFRAFF.

11:37.908 --> 11:39.445
I DID THE FIRIN' THING THAT YOU
DO WHEN THEY'RE NOT GOOD.

11:39.445 --> 11:41.414
ROTTEN FISH FROM THE HEAD,
CUT IT OFF

11:41.414 --> 11:42.549
AND THROW THEM OUT,
AND I DID IT.

11:42.549 --> 11:44.186
THAT'S NORMAL IN BUSINESS.
I KNOW.

11:44.186 --> 11:45.855
I'M ALMOST NORMAL.
AFTER YOU, I'M ALMOST NORMAL.

11:45.855 --> 11:48.693
YOU CANNOT CARRY DEAD WOOD.
NO.

11:48.693 --> 11:50.195
OKAY.

11:50.195 --> 11:51.231
THEY WERE
LIKE MORE THAN DEAD WOOD.

11:51.231 --> 11:55.405
THEY WERE LIKE A
BURNT-DOWN FOREST KIND OF.

11:55.405 --> 11:55.827
OKAY.
DON'T FORGET ME, HUH?

11:55.827 --> 11:57.240
OKAY.
DON'T FORGET ME, HUH?

11:57.240 --> 11:59.511
- YEAH. NO.
- "DON'T FORGET--"

11:59.511 --> 12:01.180
HOW COULD WE FORGET YOU?

12:01.180 --> 12:02.182
YOU'RE POURING THE WATER
ON THE TABLE.

12:02.182 --> 12:03.184
HE'S FINE.
HE'S FINE.

12:03.184 --> 12:04.853
PAT!
HE'S--

12:04.853 --> 12:05.954
I'M AWESOME.

12:05.954 --> 12:07.257
HOW ABOUT A DRINK
FOR THE LADIES?

12:07.257 --> 12:07.958
NO.

12:07.958 --> 12:09.895
I DON'T DRINK
IN SERVICE ANYMORE.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.363
YOU DON'T DRINK
IN SERVICE ANYMORE?

12:11.363 --> 12:12.566
I'M JUST GONNA HAVE
A GLASS OF WINE.

12:12.566 --> 12:15.203
UNBELIEVABLE.

12:15.203 --> 12:16.204
THAT'S AMAZING.

12:16.204 --> 12:17.340
YOU CAN HAVE A LITTLE GLASS
AFTER SERVICE.

12:17.340 --> 12:19.209
AFTER SERVICE.

12:19.209 --> 12:20.478
I SMOKE.
I SMOKE IN SERVICE.

12:20.478 --> 12:21.815
SHE SMOKES, BUT THAT'S HARD.
SHE'S TRYING.

12:21.815 --> 12:23.283
YOU SAID
YOU WERE GONNA STOP SMOKING.

12:23.283 --> 12:25.827
SHE SAID
I WAS GONNA STOP SMOKIN'.

12:25.827 --> 12:26.588
SHE SAID
I WAS GONNA STOP SMOKIN'.

12:26.588 --> 12:28.592
YOU KNOW,
IT'S A VIOLENT HABIT.

12:28.592 --> 12:29.693
I DON'T WANT
TO DO IT, BUT--

12:29.693 --> 12:31.530
TALK TO ME
ABOUT THE LAST TEN MONTHS.

12:31.530 --> 12:32.532
HOW'S IT BEEN BUSINESS-WISE?

12:32.532 --> 12:34.267
ABOUT 15%.

12:34.267 --> 12:35.268
YEAH.
15%? GREAT.

12:35.268 --> 12:37.206
THAT'S ALL THE BACK BILLS PAID.

12:37.206 --> 12:38.908
MORTGAGE IS CAUGHT UP.

12:38.908 --> 12:40.511
WHEN YOU GREET CUSTOMERS,
ARE YOU CHEWING GUM?

12:40.511 --> 12:41.813
NO.

12:41.813 --> 12:43.916
ARE YOU CHEWING GUM?

12:43.916 --> 12:45.786
NO.
NO. WHAT IS IT YOU'RE CHEWING?

12:45.786 --> 12:47.223
I SWALLOWED IT.

12:47.223 --> 12:50.193
OH, SO YOU ARE CHEWING GUM?

12:50.193 --> 12:52.264
I WAS CHEWING GUM.
AND NOW YOU JUST SWALLOWED IT.

12:52.264 --> 12:54.734
YES.

12:54.734 --> 12:55.827
NOW?
AH.

12:55.827 --> 12:57.339
NOW?
AH.

12:57.339 --> 12:58.708
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

12:58.708 --> 13:01.613
I'M SORRY, GORDON,
FOR STICKIN' MY TONGUE OUT.

13:01.613 --> 13:03.715
HE PROBABLY SAW MY CAVITIES.

13:03.715 --> 13:05.987
HOW ARE YOU TWO WORKING
TOGETHER?

13:05.987 --> 13:07.622
ARE YOU ON THE SAME PAGE?

13:07.622 --> 13:10.327
YES. WE WERE ALWAYS
ON THE SAME PAGE.

13:10.327 --> 13:11.628
YEAH.
LISA MAKES GELATO.

13:11.628 --> 13:12.730
THE STAFF--
SHE'S SO CREATIVE.

13:12.730 --> 13:15.268
AFTER YOU LEFT,
ALL THESE JUICES.

13:15.268 --> 13:16.570
YEAH.

13:16.570 --> 13:17.639
AND I CRIED.
I SOBBED LIKE A BABY.

13:17.639 --> 13:19.307
I MISSED THE CAMERAS,
I MISSED YOU,

13:19.307 --> 13:20.276
SO I GOT IN TROUBLE

13:20.276 --> 13:23.447
'CAUSE I INSTALLED
A SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM.

13:25.985 --> 13:27.988
SHE SAID I SPENT MONEY
FOOLISHLY.

13:27.988 --> 13:29.724
I HAD TO DO IT.

13:29.724 --> 13:30.826
I WANTED A GELATO MACHINE,
AND SHE SAID

13:30.826 --> 13:31.994
WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY MONEY
AT THAT TIME.

13:31.994 --> 13:33.363
BUT I NEEDED CAMERAS.
I NEEDED CAMERAS, GORDON.

13:33.363 --> 13:35.267
SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND.
I NEEDED THE CAMERAS.

13:35.267 --> 13:36.970
SO, NOW I HAVE
THIS LITTLE MACHINE--

13:36.970 --> 13:38.605
GELATO MACHINE NOW?
YUP.

13:38.605 --> 13:39.975
GOOD.
AND I HAVE FOUR CAMERAS.

13:39.975 --> 13:41.311
I WANTED EIGHT.
RIGHT.

13:41.311 --> 13:43.479
I SETTLED FOR FOUR
'CAUSE I WANTED TO SHARE.

13:43.479 --> 13:45.483
I HAD THE SURVEILLANCE THING
ON MY PHONE.

13:45.483 --> 13:48.889
I COULD FLIP ON MY PHONE AND
LOOK TO SEE WHAT WAS GOIN' ON,

13:48.889 --> 13:53.729
BUT I USED TO DO IT
WHILE I WAS DRIVING, AND SO I--

13:53.729 --> 13:54.999
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T TEXT,
AND I'M PRETTY SURE

13:54.999 --> 13:55.827
YOU CAN'T WATCH
THE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS EITHER.

13:55.827 --> 13:58.605
YOU CAN'T WATCH
THE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS EITHER.

13:58.605 --> 13:59.941
AND SO YOU'VE GOT THE CAMERAS IN

13:59.941 --> 14:01.409
SO WHEN YOU'RE NOT HERE
YOU CAN MAINTAIN--

14:01.409 --> 14:03.312
WELL, SOMETIMES I WALK AROUND,
AND THEN I GO DOWNSTAIRS,

14:03.312 --> 14:05.582
AND I PLAY IT BACK,
AND I WATCH MYSELF,

14:05.582 --> 14:08.453
OR, IF SOMEBODY FALLS,
I GO, AND I LOOK AT IT.

14:08.453 --> 14:11.592
I THINK THE SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS
ARE USELESS.

14:11.592 --> 14:14.297
SHE GOES
AND REPLAYS STUPID.

14:14.297 --> 14:16.533
LIKE, I FELL ONE TIME
IN THE KITCHEN.

14:16.533 --> 14:17.569
SHE'LL GO DOWNSTAIRS
AND, LIKE,

14:17.569 --> 14:19.705
WATCH ME FALL OVER
AND OVER AGAIN.

14:19.705 --> 14:22.810
YOU TWO HAVE GOT
SUCH A HUGE FAN BASE.

14:22.810 --> 14:24.279
THEY LOVE US.
YEAH.

14:24.279 --> 14:25.582
IN LONDON.
YOU KNOW
WHERE ELSE THEY LOVE US?

14:25.582 --> 14:25.827
FROM PRISON.

14:25.827 --> 14:26.983
FROM PRISON.

14:26.983 --> 14:29.255
YOU'RE HUGE IN PRISON.
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

14:29.255 --> 14:30.256
IN PRISONS?
IN PRISONS.

14:30.256 --> 14:32.359
RITA'S HAS A STALKER.
I HAVE A STALKER.

14:32.359 --> 14:33.462
HE'S WRITTEN HER,
LIKE, EIGHT LETTERS.

14:33.462 --> 14:34.729
SERIOUSLY?
YES.

14:34.729 --> 14:36.366
HE'S COMIN' OUT IN 26 YEARS.

14:36.366 --> 14:39.805
HE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE ME
FOR COFFEE.

14:39.805 --> 14:41.574
MINE ARE ALL LIFERS,
SO I DON'T HAVE TO GO OUT.

14:41.574 --> 14:42.910
THEY'RE LIFERS.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.

14:42.910 --> 14:44.713
YES.
YEAH.

14:44.713 --> 14:46.482
I'VE GOTTEN--
A GUY WANTS TO BUY MY SHOES

14:46.482 --> 14:48.586
'CAUSE HE HAS A FOOT FETISH.

14:48.586 --> 14:50.021
MARRIAGE PROPOSALS,
BUT I'M ALREADY MARRIED,

14:50.021 --> 14:52.593
SO, I MEAN,
UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE TO SAY NO.

14:52.593 --> 14:54.295
SORRY.
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME?

14:54.295 --> 14:55.397
I'LL QUICKLY GO DOWN
TO THE BATHROOM,

14:55.397 --> 14:55.827
AND I'LL COME BACK,
HAVE A QUICK BITE TO EAT.

14:55.827 --> 14:56.398
AND I'LL COME BACK,
HAVE A QUICK BITE TO EAT.

14:56.398 --> 14:57.400
OKAY.
SO I'LL GO DOWNSTAIRS.

14:57.400 --> 14:58.703
SHOULD I COME WITH?

14:58.703 --> 14:59.838
NO, YOU'RE NOT COMING
TO THE BATHROOM WITH ME.

14:59.838 --> 15:01.306
NO.
NOT INTO THE BATHROOM.

15:01.306 --> 15:05.279
NO. EXCUSE ME.
I MEAN DOWNSTAIRS.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.347
I'VE GOT
TO CHECK SOMETHING OUT FIRST

15:06.347 --> 15:07.818
BEFORE I GO TO THE BATHROOM.

15:07.818 --> 15:09.987
I AM DYING TO FIND OUT
WHAT THEY'VE GOT.

15:13.393 --> 15:14.829
WOW.

15:14.829 --> 15:15.996
LISA.
LISA.

15:15.996 --> 15:16.998
RITA?
LISA AND RITA.

15:16.998 --> 15:18.301
- OH, MY GOD.
- HOLY.

15:18.301 --> 15:19.503
YES!

15:19.503 --> 15:20.704
TWO SECONDS, PLEASE.

15:20.704 --> 15:21.907
YES.
RITA OR LISA?

15:21.907 --> 15:22.909
I JUST WANT THE BOTH OF YOU.

15:22.909 --> 15:24.377
BOTH OF US.

15:24.377 --> 15:25.011
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S HAPPENING.

15:25.011 --> 15:25.827
OH, MY GOD.

15:25.827 --> 15:26.347
OH, MY GOD.

15:26.347 --> 15:29.085
FIRST OF ALL--
SERIOUSLY?

15:29.085 --> 15:32.958
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
WHAT IS IT?

15:32.958 --> 15:34.327
IT'S NOTHING!
IT'S ICE CREAM.

15:34.327 --> 15:35.394
IT'S EMPTY!
IT'S EMPTY.

15:35.394 --> 15:38.334
COME ON!
WE THREW THE OTHER ONE OUT!

15:38.334 --> 15:41.974
WOW. SO, THIS ONE'S JUST PACKED
WITH FROZEN PASTA.

15:41.974 --> 15:43.609
WHAT THE
ARE THEY?

15:43.609 --> 15:44.878
THOSE ARE PORCINI RAVIOLI.

15:44.878 --> 15:45.879
OH, MY GOD.

15:45.879 --> 15:47.348
JUST GELATO.
THAT'S IT.

15:47.348 --> 15:48.784
THAT'S IT.

15:48.784 --> 15:50.318
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO HAVE SORBET
IN THE FREEZER.

15:50.318 --> 15:51.321
YEAH.
WE HAVE TO FREEZE THAT.

15:51.321 --> 15:52.056
IS THAT YOUR NEW MACHINE?

15:52.056 --> 15:53.625
THAT'S MY LITTLE MACHINE

15:53.625 --> 15:54.626
I LOVE IT.
IT'S SO LITTLE.

15:54.626 --> 15:55.827
THE POOR BASTARD.

15:55.827 --> 15:55.829
THE POOR BASTARD.

15:55.829 --> 15:57.497
I'M SO EXCITED
THAT YOU'RE INTO SORBET.

15:57.497 --> 15:59.768
THIS IS FANTASTIC.
WANT TO SEE MY MOONSHINE?

15:59.768 --> 16:01.104
YOUR MOONSHINE?
YEAH.

16:01.104 --> 16:02.071
WHERE IS IT?
OVER HERE.

16:02.071 --> 16:04.609
OH, MY GOD.

16:04.609 --> 16:06.012
WE'RE GONNA MAKE AN ICE CREAM
WITH THIS, GORDON.

16:06.012 --> 16:07.414
IT'S GONNA BE SO GOOD.

16:07.414 --> 16:10.954
WATCH YOUR NOSE HAIRS.

16:13.390 --> 16:14.592
HOW LONG'S
THAT BEEN BREWING IN THERE?

16:14.592 --> 16:15.929
WELL, IT'S GOT A DATE ON THERE.

16:15.929 --> 16:17.363
I DATE-LABEL EVERYTHING
'CAUSE YOU TAUGHT ME.

16:17.363 --> 16:18.465
YEAH.

16:18.465 --> 16:19.935
ARE YOU DRINKIN' THAT--
HELL, NO.

16:19.935 --> 16:21.337
I DON'T DRINK.
I DON'T EVEN DRINK THAT DRINK.

16:22.538 --> 16:24.374
ALL THAT WORK!

16:24.374 --> 16:25.827
ARE YOU GONNA PUT THAT
INTO THE GELATOS.

16:25.827 --> 16:26.846
ARE YOU GONNA PUT THAT
INTO THE GELATOS.

16:26.846 --> 16:28.080
YEAH.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.082
IT'S GONNA BE SO GOOD.
THAT'S THE IDEA.

16:29.082 --> 16:30.085
IT'S GONNA BE SO GOOD.

16:30.085 --> 16:31.687
BLOODY HELL.

16:31.687 --> 16:33.122
THIS IS HOW WE'RE GONNA DO IT.

16:33.122 --> 16:35.059
WHEN MY MOONSHINE IS DONE,

16:35.059 --> 16:38.599
I'M GONNA GIVE
A SHOT TO PAT,

16:38.599 --> 16:40.368
AND WE'RE GONNA WAIT TWO DAYS.

16:40.368 --> 16:43.572
IF NOTHING HAPPENS TO HIM,
LIKE DEATH OR SERIOUS ILLNESS,

16:43.572 --> 16:48.013
LISA WILL THEN TAKE IT
AND WORK IT INTO A GELATO,

16:48.013 --> 16:52.420
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK I CAN
LEGALLY GIVE ANYBODY MOONSHINE.

16:52.420 --> 16:55.827
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO JAIL--

16:55.827 --> 16:55.959
I DON'T WANT TO GO TO JAIL--

16:55.959 --> 16:57.428
I WAS GONNA SAY AGAIN.

16:58.831 --> 17:00.801
OH,.
OH, MY GOD.

17:00.801 --> 17:03.840
I'M DYING FOR YOU
TO TASTE THAT.

17:06.075 --> 17:09.448
WOW. IT'S LIKE SOMEONE'S
THROWN UP ON MY PLATE.

17:09.448 --> 17:11.084
WOW.

17:11.084 --> 17:12.487
THIS IS DELICIOUS.

17:12.487 --> 17:13.589
MILES APART.

17:13.589 --> 17:14.957
IT'S REALLY GOOD INDEED.

17:14.957 --> 17:16.626
IN TERMS OF YOUR GELATOS,
HOW MANY DIFFERENT FLAVORS?

17:16.626 --> 17:18.397
WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON?
WELL, WE CAN LET YOU TASTE--

17:18.397 --> 17:21.067
I'D LOVE TO TASTE ONE.

17:21.067 --> 17:22.101
I'M GONNA STAY HERE
WITH THE CHEF.

17:22.101 --> 17:23.538
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

17:23.538 --> 17:25.675
I DON'T EAT 80%
OF LISA'S FLAVORED GELATO.

17:25.675 --> 17:25.827
I DON'T LIKE THAT ONE
WITH THE FLOWERS IN IT.

17:25.827 --> 17:28.713
I DON'T LIKE THAT ONE
WITH THE FLOWERS IN IT.

17:28.713 --> 17:31.784
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE WITH HONEY.
DON'T LIKE THAT.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.888
ALTHOUGH HER GELATO'S REALLY
GOOD, THE TEXTURE'S PERFECT,

17:33.888 --> 17:37.593
BUT THOSE FLAVORS JUST--
SO BUSY IN THERE.

17:37.593 --> 17:39.164
OKAY.
WE HAVE THE CHOCOLATE ORANGE.

17:39.164 --> 17:40.432
- CHOCOLATE ORANGE.
- YEAH. EAT THAT ONE.

17:40.432 --> 17:41.500
THE ANISE.

17:41.500 --> 17:42.569
THE "ANUS."

17:42.569 --> 17:44.706
ANISE.

17:44.706 --> 17:46.741
WHY WOULD SOMEBODY ORDER
SOMETHING CALLED "ANUS"?

17:48.445 --> 17:50.082
YOU CAN'T SHOUT,
"ANUS SORBET, ANYBODY?"

17:50.082 --> 17:54.722
I'M HUMILIATED BECAUSE SHE SAYS
ANUS TO CHEF RAMSAY.

17:54.722 --> 17:55.827
IT'S DISGUSTING TO THINK OF AN
ASS IN REFERENCE TO ICE CREAM.

17:55.827 --> 17:58.962
IT'S DISGUSTING TO THINK OF AN
ASS IN REFERENCE TO ICE CREAM.

17:58.962 --> 17:59.963
THAT'S GROSS.

17:59.963 --> 18:01.499
THAT'S BLACKBERRY LAVENDER.

18:01.499 --> 18:04.939
SHE SOMETIMES GIVES THEM
TO ME TO EAT.

18:04.939 --> 18:06.440
BUT BUT THEN MY MOUTH
GOES ON FIRE

18:06.440 --> 18:07.510
'CAUSE SHE COMES UP
WITH ALL THESE FLAVORS

18:07.510 --> 18:08.578
INSTEAD OF CHOCOLATE.

18:08.578 --> 18:10.447
SHE HAS A VERY IMMATURE PALATE.

18:10.447 --> 18:11.951
NOT TO MAKE HER, LIKE--
WELL, SHE SMOKES.

18:11.951 --> 18:13.486
HER TASTE BUDS ARE GONE.
OH, MY GOD.

18:13.486 --> 18:15.188
WHAT IS THIS?
BEAT UP RITA DAY?

18:15.188 --> 18:16.892
AND THIS ONE?
THAT'S A--I MEAN, ANISE.

18:16.892 --> 18:20.130
OH, YOU--SHE JUST SAID ANUS.

18:20.130 --> 18:21.164
ANISE.

18:21.164 --> 18:23.201
ANISE.

18:23.201 --> 18:25.405
ANITH.
ANITH.

18:25.405 --> 18:25.827
IS THAT IT?
ANIS?

18:25.827 --> 18:27.509
IS THAT IT?
ANIS?

18:27.509 --> 18:30.781
ANIS.
IT STILL SOUNDS LIKE ANUS.

18:30.781 --> 18:33.551
THAT IS DELICIOUS.

18:33.551 --> 18:34.553
GREAT JOB.

18:34.553 --> 18:36.557
SERIOUSLY.
I AM SO IMPRESSED.

18:36.557 --> 18:37.725
SO AM I.
UH-HUH.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.628
BUT YOU'RE NOT LEAVIN' NOW,
ARE YOU?

18:39.628 --> 18:40.762
NO?

18:40.762 --> 18:42.634
NO. I HAVE TO GO.
NOW? ALREADY?

18:42.634 --> 18:45.203
EVERY TIME GORDON LEAVES,
I GET SO SAD.

18:45.203 --> 18:47.808
WE NEED HIM HERE IN BOSTON,
'CAUSE, LET ME TELL YOU,

18:47.808 --> 18:49.477
THERE'S A LOT
OF NIGHTMARES HERE.

18:49.477 --> 18:52.515
I AM CERTAINLY
NOT THE ONLY ONE.

18:52.515 --> 18:53.517
BYE, MY DARLING.

18:53.517 --> 18:55.827
COME ON.
IT'S THAT TIME OF DAY.

18:55.827 --> 18:55.922
COME ON.
IT'S THAT TIME OF DAY.

18:55.922 --> 18:57.491
AMAZING LUNCH.
SO SOON?

18:57.491 --> 18:58.625
I KNOW. I KNOW.
I KNOW. I KNOW.

18:58.625 --> 18:59.760
YOU KNOW,
YOU CAN'T JUST WALK

18:59.760 --> 19:01.431
INTO OUR LIVES
AND LEAVE LIKE THIS.

19:01.431 --> 19:02.531
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

19:02.531 --> 19:03.767
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.
MWAH.

19:03.767 --> 19:04.902
GOOD TO SEE YOU BOTH.
YES?

19:06.538 --> 19:07.540
PLEASE?

19:07.540 --> 19:09.076
I SHALL DO.

19:09.076 --> 19:10.078
LOVE YOU.
BYE-BYE.

19:10.078 --> 19:11.881
BYE, CHEF.
BYE-BYE, NOW.

19:11.881 --> 19:14.485
I HAVE TO ADMIT
THAT BOTH LISA AND RITA ARE TWO

19:14.485 --> 19:15.820
OF MY FAVORITE OWNERS
I'VE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE

19:15.820 --> 19:17.123
OF WORKING WITH
ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES,

19:17.123 --> 19:20.462
AND NOW, DUE TO ALL
THEIR EFFORTS, THE GALLERIA 33

19:20.462 --> 19:23.600
IS A STRONG, INDEPENDENT,
BRILLIANT RESTAURANT

19:23.600 --> 19:25.827
IN THE NORTH END
AND FINALLY SOMETHING WORTHY

19:25.827 --> 19:26.471
IN THE NORTH END
AND FINALLY SOMETHING WORTHY

19:26.471 --> 19:28.508
OF THEIR PARENTS' LEGACY.

19:30.144 --> 19:32.480
OH, JEEZ.
MAN.

19:32.480 --> 19:33.482
HONESTLY.

19:34.584 --> 19:36.487
HE'S GONNA CHECK UP ON US AGAIN.

19:36.487 --> 19:38.824
YOU CAN'T LEAVE US FOR TOO LONG
WITHOUT CHECKIN' UP ON US

19:38.824 --> 19:42.697
BECAUSE THEN THINGS--
HE'LL BE BACK.

19:45.469 --> 19:47.172
COMING UP, CHEF RAMSAY
HEADS BACK

19:47.172 --> 19:48.640
TO THE OLDE HITCHING POST.

19:48.640 --> 19:51.179
SHELLFISH IS SOMETHING
YOU NEVER FREEZE!

19:51.179 --> 19:52.480
WHERE A FATHER HAD A HARD TIME

19:52.480 --> 19:54.017
GIVING UP CONTROL
TO HIS DAUGHTER.

19:54.017 --> 19:55.585
YOU NO READY TO TAKE OVER.

19:55.585 --> 19:55.827
FIND OUT WHAT STARTLES
CHEF RAMSAY.

19:55.827 --> 19:57.188
FIND OUT WHAT STARTLES
CHEF RAMSAY.

19:57.188 --> 20:00.159
I'M GONNA DO THE COOKING
THIS TIME..

20:00.159 --> 20:01.161
AS SOON AS HE WALKS
THROUGH THE DOOR.

20:01.161 --> 20:03.163
TOM!
COME BACK!

20:08.815 --> 20:10.616
HANSON, MASSACHUSETTS.

20:10.616 --> 20:12.052
HOME TO ONE
OF THE MOST STUBBORN OWNERS

20:12.052 --> 20:14.824
I'VE EVER MET,
TOM KESSARIS.

20:14.824 --> 20:16.359
THE BEEF TIPS,
PEOPLE DON'T LOVE 'EM.

20:16.359 --> 20:17.828
DON'T TELL ME THAT.

20:17.828 --> 20:18.997
THIS MAN PURCHASED
THE RESTAURANT,

20:18.997 --> 20:22.135
CALLED THE OLDE HITCHING POST,
FOR HIS DAUGHTER ANDREA.

20:22.135 --> 20:23.672
GOOD AFTERNOON.
OLDE HITCHING POST.

20:23.672 --> 20:26.142
BUT HAD NO INTENTION
OF EVER GIVING IT TO HER.

20:26.142 --> 20:28.012
YOU GOT TO MAKE SURE--

20:28.012 --> 20:29.013
JANICE IS IN THE FRONT
TONIGHT.

20:29.013 --> 20:30.382
BUT I WANT YOU
TO BE THERE TOO.

20:30.382 --> 20:31.918
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU GO?
BECAUSE NO, YOU!

20:31.918 --> 20:34.456
FROM THE BEGINNING I COULD
ALREADY TELL THAT TOM AND ANDREA

20:34.456 --> 20:35.746
WERE ON TWO COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PAGES.

20:35.746 --> 20:36.758
WERE ON TWO COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PAGES.

20:36.758 --> 20:39.798
WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU, ANDREA,
YOU NO READY TO TAKE OVER.

20:39.798 --> 20:41.767
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

20:41.767 --> 20:43.638
DEFINITELY NOT
A NICE SITUATION,

20:43.638 --> 20:46.442
AND SITTING
IN THAT DRAB DINING ROOM

20:46.442 --> 20:48.678
DIDN'T MAKE IT ANY BETTER.

20:48.678 --> 20:51.716
I KNOW WE'RE IN THE AREA
OF CRANBERRY, BUT, MY GOD,

20:51.716 --> 20:55.756
FROM NAPKINS TO THE WALLS
IT'S CRANBERRY O.D.

20:55.756 --> 20:57.761
THEN I MET MY SERVER CARLA.

20:57.761 --> 20:59.630
OH, CARLA.

20:59.630 --> 21:00.932
WHEN WAS THIS ONE MADE?

21:00.932 --> 21:03.435
THIS WAS MADE TODAY.

21:03.435 --> 21:05.606
SHE LIED TO ME.

21:05.606 --> 21:05.746
SHE TOLD ME
THE FOOD WAS FRESH.

21:05.746 --> 21:07.776
SHE TOLD ME
THE FOOD WAS FRESH.

21:07.776 --> 21:09.747
DRY.
HORRIBLE TEXTURE.

21:09.747 --> 21:11.816
ARE YOU SURE THAT WAS MADE
TODAY, DARLING?

21:11.816 --> 21:13.754
IT WAS NOT, CHEF.

21:13.754 --> 21:15.122
IT'S FROZEN.
IT'S FROZEN.

21:15.122 --> 21:16.792
YES, FROZEN.
CARLA, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS
TO ME?

21:16.792 --> 21:18.794
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

21:18.794 --> 21:21.132
BUT I WASN'T GONNA GET MAD
AT HER.

21:21.132 --> 21:23.068
I MEAN, LOOK AT IT.

21:23.068 --> 21:26.407
IT WAS TOM WHO WAS LIVING
IN A FANTASY WORLD.

21:26.407 --> 21:28.778
HE THOUGHT THERE WAS NOTHING
WRONG, AND, ON TOP OF THAT,

21:28.778 --> 21:30.646
HE THOUGHT I WAS GONNA LOVE
HIS FOOD.

21:30.646 --> 21:32.718
I THOUGHT YOU GONNA LOVE
MY MEATLOAF,

21:32.718 --> 21:33.751
REGARDLESS IF IT WAS FROZEN.

21:33.751 --> 21:35.746
YOU THOUGHT LIKE THAT?
I REALLY DID.

21:35.746 --> 21:35.990
YOU THOUGHT LIKE THAT?
I REALLY DID.

21:35.990 --> 21:37.858
IT'S AN INSULT TO AMERICA!

21:37.858 --> 21:39.828
IN THIS AREA,
THAT'S WHAT THEY LOVE.

21:41.030 --> 21:43.768
TOM WAS REFUSING
TO SEE THE PROBLEMS,

21:43.768 --> 21:45.739
EVEN THOUGH THEY
WERE STARING HIM IN THE FACE,

21:45.739 --> 21:48.943
AND, ON TOP OF THAT, HE WOULDN'T
LISTEN TO ME OR HIS STAFF.

21:48.943 --> 21:51.816
WE TALKED ALL THE TIME
THAT THE FOOD'S NOT THAT GOOD.

21:51.816 --> 21:52.816
DID YOU TELL HIM TO CHANGE?

21:52.816 --> 21:54.753
YOU DON'T LET HIM
CHANGE THINGS.

21:54.753 --> 21:55.854
I NEVER ALLOW HIM--
WE TRY TAKING THINGS--

21:55.854 --> 21:57.558
I NEVER ALLOWED HIM
NOT TO CHANGE ANYTHING.

21:57.558 --> 21:58.692
HE SAYS HE TRIES TO--

21:58.692 --> 21:59.860
WHEN DID I TELL YOU
NOT TO CHANGE?

21:59.860 --> 22:03.433
I'VE TRIED TO TAKE THINGS--
COME ON, THEN.

22:03.433 --> 22:05.504
PIECE OF.

22:05.504 --> 22:05.746
SO, I KNEW DINNER SERVICE
WOULD BE A CHALLENGE,

22:05.746 --> 22:07.539
SO, I KNEW DINNER SERVICE
WOULD BE A CHALLENGE,

22:07.539 --> 22:09.510
BUT I DIDN'T EXPECT TOM
TO TELL ME

22:09.510 --> 22:12.582
THAT HIS FROZEN SCALLOPS
SMELLED OCEAN FRESH.

22:12.582 --> 22:14.853
JUST SMELL INSIDE THERE.

22:14.853 --> 22:17.858
SMELLS BEAUTIFUL.
OCEAN FRESH.

22:17.858 --> 22:19.827
I'VE NEVER HEARD OR SEEN THAT
ADVERTISED BEFORE.

22:19.827 --> 22:21.096
RULE NUMBER ONE

22:21.096 --> 22:22.765
WHEN STUDYING TO BE A CHEF--

22:22.765 --> 22:25.504
FRESH FOOD DOESN'T SMELL
OR TASTE  BETTER

22:25.504 --> 22:26.738
ONCE IT'S FROZEN!

22:26.738 --> 22:27.806
HERE YOU ARE LECTURING ME

22:27.806 --> 22:30.110
THAT THAT  THING
IS FRESH!

22:30.110 --> 22:31.846
IT WASN'T JUST ME.

22:31.846 --> 22:32.948
TOM'S DAUGHTER ANDREA

22:32.948 --> 22:33.949
COULDN'T BELIEVE
WHAT SHE WAS SEEING EITHER.

22:33.949 --> 22:35.746
OH, MY GOD.

22:35.746 --> 22:36.054
OH, MY GOD.

22:36.054 --> 22:38.691
AND SHE KNEW HER DAD
NEEDED TO CHANGE.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.862
I WANT THIS BUSINESS, BUT I
WANT IT TO FUNCTION CORRECTLY,

22:41.862 --> 22:45.936
AND MY FEAR IS THAT,
BY THE TIME IT COMES TO ME,

22:45.936 --> 22:49.208
WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH IT?
THERE'S NOTHING TO HAVE.

22:50.811 --> 22:53.514
AFTER TOM REALIZED THAT HE
SHOULDN'T SERVE FROZEN FOOD,

22:53.514 --> 22:56.886
HE THEN CAME TO ME,
OPEN WITH THE IDEA OF CHANGE.

22:56.886 --> 22:58.925
YOU GOT MY SUPPORT 100%.

22:58.925 --> 22:59.925
I WANT TO BE
RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.

22:59.925 --> 23:01.027
WE HAVE TO CHANGE.

23:01.027 --> 23:03.632
IMMEDIATELY,
AND I TRUST YOU.

23:03.632 --> 23:04.767
MM-HMM.
I NEED YOUR HELP.

23:04.767 --> 23:05.746
LET'S GET TOGETHER.

23:05.746 --> 23:05.902
LET'S GET TOGETHER.

23:05.902 --> 23:07.504
IT WAS A SHOCKING TURNAROUND

23:07.504 --> 23:09.141
FROM SUCH A STUBBORN MAN.

23:09.141 --> 23:11.644
KNOW WHAT?
I WAS BLIND ALL THIS TIME.

23:13.782 --> 23:15.884
NOW THAT TOM HAD REALIZED
WHAT HE WAS DOING WRONG,

23:15.884 --> 23:18.156
IT WAS TIME
TO GET TO WORK.

23:18.156 --> 23:21.026
REMEMBER THOSE DREADFUL
CRANBERRY WALLS?

23:21.026 --> 23:23.998
I GOT RID OF THEM IMMEDIATELY.

23:23.998 --> 23:25.234
WOW.

23:25.234 --> 23:27.069
OH, MY GOD.

23:27.069 --> 23:28.606
OH, MY GOD.

23:28.606 --> 23:29.608
OH, MY GOD.

23:29.608 --> 23:30.842
ARE WE IN OZ?

23:30.842 --> 23:31.877
STAY WITH ME.

23:31.877 --> 23:33.848
STAY WITH--

23:33.848 --> 23:35.250
STAY WITH ME.

23:35.250 --> 23:35.746
FINALLY, TOM AND ANDREA WERE ON
THE SAME PAGE ABOUT SOMETHING.

23:35.746 --> 23:38.755
FINALLY, TOM AND ANDREA WERE ON
THE SAME PAGE ABOUT SOMETHING.

23:38.755 --> 23:41.026
LIKE IT, DAD?
I LOVE IT.

23:41.026 --> 23:43.229
IT WAS TIME TO RE-LAUNCH
THE RESTAURANT.

23:43.229 --> 23:44.999
I PUT ANDREA IN CHARGE...

23:44.999 --> 23:47.970
TABLE 23.
TWO CLAM CHOWDERS,

23:47.970 --> 23:48.806
CAESAR,
AND A WEDGE SALAD.

23:48.806 --> 23:51.009
AND IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE SUCCESS.

23:51.009 --> 23:52.912
UP.
GOT IT?

23:52.912 --> 23:54.548
CARLA, PICK UP.
29.

23:54.548 --> 23:56.952
ANDREA, SHOW 'EM
WHAT YOU CAN DO, HONEY.

23:56.952 --> 23:59.824
TOM COULD SEE HOW ANDREA
WAS READY TO RUN

23:59.824 --> 24:02.494
THE OLDE HITCHING POST
ON HER OWN.

24:05.899 --> 24:07.837
I'M LEAVING.
OKAY.

24:07.837 --> 24:09.940
I WANT YOU TO
TAKE CARE OF IT.

24:09.940 --> 24:12.009
I WANT YOU TO BE SUCCESSFUL,

24:12.009 --> 24:14.547
AND YOU KNOW I'LL ALWAYS BE NEXT
TO YOU FOR WHATEVER YOU NEED.

24:14.547 --> 24:16.049
I KNOW.

24:16.049 --> 24:18.621
SO, GO OUT THERE, GIRL,
AND GET 'EM.

24:18.621 --> 24:19.654
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT?

24:19.654 --> 24:21.893
I LOVE YOU, DAD.
I LOVE YOU TOO, HONEY.

24:23.795 --> 24:26.000
TO BE HONEST, I NEVER THOUGHT
WE WOULD GET HERE.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.972
GETTING THE OKAY FROM MY DAD
TO STEP UP AND BE IN CHARGE,

24:29.972 --> 24:30.940
IT'S AMAZING.

24:30.940 --> 24:32.142
WELL DONE TO YOU ALL.

24:32.142 --> 24:35.247
THANKS, DAD.
THANK YOU.

24:42.792 --> 24:44.762
I'M BACK AT THE OLDE HITCHING
POST WHERE I MET

24:44.762 --> 24:46.666
A VERY STUBBORN OWNER, TOM,

24:46.666 --> 24:48.002
WHO BOUGHT A RESTAURANT
FOR HIS DAUGHTER.

24:48.002 --> 24:49.837
EVEN AFTER SEVEN YEARS,

24:49.837 --> 24:51.674
HE WASN'T READY TO
HAND HER CONTROL,

24:51.674 --> 24:54.678
BUT I WAS ABLE TO CONVINCE HIM
THAT SHE WAS MORE THAN CAPABLE

24:54.678 --> 24:57.016
AND DEFINITELY READY TO RUN
THE RESTAURANT ON HER OWN.

24:57.016 --> 24:59.787
I'M JUST HOPING HE STUCK
TO HIS WORD.

25:09.442 --> 25:12.114
LAST YEAR, WHEN I CAME
TO THE OLDE HITCHING POST, TOM,

25:12.114 --> 25:15.119
THE OWNER, WAS RUNNING
HIS RESTAURANT LIKE A TYRANT

25:15.119 --> 25:17.423
AND RUNNING THE BUSINESS AND HIS
DAUGHTER INTO THE GROUND.

25:17.423 --> 25:20.126
AFTER MUCH CONVINCING, HE
FINALLY HANDED OVER THE CONTROL

25:20.126 --> 25:21.429
TO HIS DAUGHTER ANDREA.

25:21.429 --> 25:24.232
I'M HOPING
THAT IS STILL THE CASE.

25:27.205 --> 25:28.941
THAT COLOR.
BEAUTIFUL.

25:30.645 --> 25:31.645
CHEF.
HELLO.

25:31.645 --> 25:33.214
HOW ARE YOU?

25:33.214 --> 25:34.712
I AM SO HAPPY TO BE BACK.

25:34.712 --> 25:35.218
I AM SO HAPPY TO BE BACK.

25:35.218 --> 25:36.454
IT'S SO NICE TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

25:36.454 --> 25:38.056
YOU LOOK GREAT.
THANK YOU.

25:38.056 --> 25:40.193
THE COLOR OF THIS BUILDING,
IT IS SO INVITING.

25:40.193 --> 25:42.263
IT'S CALLED "SHOWSTOPPER RED."
WHO'S IDEA WAS THAT?

25:42.263 --> 25:43.999
MY CHANGE. MY IDEA.
AND WHERE IS TOM?

25:43.999 --> 25:45.035
YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND HIM
IN HERE.

25:45.035 --> 25:46.136
TOM HAS NEVER LEFT THE BUILDING,

25:46.136 --> 25:47.571
AND HE'S NOT HERE ANYWHERE?
NO.

25:47.571 --> 25:49.309
WOW.
THAT IS GREAT NEWS.

25:49.309 --> 25:51.311
MY DAD HAS LEFT. HE'S DEFINITELY
OUT OF THE BUILDING.

25:51.311 --> 25:54.316
TOOK A LONG TIME, BUT MY FATHER
FINALLY TRUSTS THAT I KNOW

25:54.316 --> 25:56.152
WHAT I'M DOING,
AND DAD IS OFFICIALLY GONE.

25:56.152 --> 25:59.057
THAT PIVOTAL MOMENT
WHEN THAT TRANSITION TOOK PLACE,

25:59.057 --> 26:00.192
WHEN WAS THAT?

26:00.192 --> 26:02.228
IT TOOK HIM A LONG TIME
TO REALIZE THAT.

26:02.228 --> 26:04.433
IT'S BEEN--WE'RE ON MONTH FOUR
NOW OF COMPLETELY BEING

26:04.433 --> 26:04.712
ON OUR OWN
AND RUNNING THE SHOW.

26:04.712 --> 26:07.137
ON OUR OWN
AND RUNNING THE SHOW.

26:07.137 --> 26:08.440
ON MOST PARTS,
MY HANDS ARE TIED.

26:08.440 --> 26:11.043
JUST--HE'S HAVING A HARD TIME
BACKING DOWN.

26:11.043 --> 26:12.445
YOU'RE RUNNING THE BUSINESS?
RUN EVERYTHING.

26:12.445 --> 26:14.282
WOW.
FINANCIALS, EVERYTHING.

26:14.282 --> 26:15.684
EVERYTHING GOT TURNED OVER
INTO MY NAME.

26:15.684 --> 26:18.121
SO, WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED,
THE BUSINESS WAS LOSING MONEY,

26:18.121 --> 26:20.092
AND WHERE ARE WE NOW?
WE PAY ALL OF OUR BILLS.

26:20.092 --> 26:21.259
EVERYTHING IS TAKEN CARE OF.

26:21.259 --> 26:22.327
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

26:22.327 --> 26:23.964
YEAH.
WHERE IS TOM?

26:23.964 --> 26:25.633
TOM IS ACTUALLY NEXT DOOR
WITH MY DAUGHTER.

26:25.633 --> 26:27.170
HE'S NEXT DOOR.
YEAH.

26:27.170 --> 26:28.071
BABYSITTING?
YEAH.

26:28.071 --> 26:29.406
WHY DON'T YOU BRING DAD OVER?

26:29.406 --> 26:30.475
YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.
YEAH. BRILLIANT.
THANKS, DARLING.

26:30.475 --> 26:32.043
EXCELLENT.

26:32.043 --> 26:33.547
SINCE GORDON LEFT,
MY DAD HAS MOVED

26:33.547 --> 26:34.712
ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF
AWAY.

26:34.712 --> 26:35.316
ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF
AWAY.

26:35.316 --> 26:37.185
NOW WHEN I SEE MY DAD
ONCE A WEEK,

26:37.185 --> 26:40.658
IT'S FAMILY TIME INSTEAD
OF, LIKE, KILL-EACH-OTHER TIME.

26:40.658 --> 26:42.360
TOM!

26:42.360 --> 26:44.197
CHEF RAMSAY.
COME HERE.

26:44.197 --> 26:45.432
HI.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

26:45.432 --> 26:47.000
OH, LIKEWISE.

26:47.000 --> 26:48.404
IT'S BEEN A YEAR.
GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO.

26:48.404 --> 26:50.040
HAVE YOU MISSED ME?
VERY MUCH.

26:50.040 --> 26:54.147
THIS YOUNG LADY HAS FINALLY
GOT THE REINS.

26:54.147 --> 26:56.015
I WAS A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS
ON THE WAY HERE.

26:56.015 --> 26:58.320
I WAS THINKING THAT YOU
WERE GONNA PULL BACK CONTROL.

26:58.320 --> 26:59.689
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

26:59.689 --> 27:03.228
THANK YOU FOR STANDING TRUE
TO YOUR WORD.

27:03.228 --> 27:04.712
WHY DON'T WE GO AND HAVE
A CATCH-UP, MAYBE A BITE TO EAT?

27:04.712 --> 27:05.132
WHY DON'T WE GO AND HAVE
A CATCH-UP, MAYBE A BITE TO EAT?

27:05.132 --> 27:06.734
ABSOLUTELY.
YEAH?

27:06.734 --> 27:10.439
GORDON THOUGHT
I WAS VERY STUBBORN PERSON.

27:10.439 --> 27:13.044
HE DIDN'T BELIEVE ME, I WAS
GONNA GIVE THE RESTAURANT

27:13.044 --> 27:15.414
TO MY DAUGHTER,
BUT I LEFT, AND ANDREA?

27:15.414 --> 27:17.117
SHE LOVES EVERY BIT OF IT.

27:17.117 --> 27:20.189
I THOUGHT I'D WALK IN THE DOOR,
YOU'D BE RUNNING AROUND,

27:20.189 --> 27:21.491
SCREAMING AND SHOUTING.

27:21.491 --> 27:23.761
IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF IT'S FROZEN OR NOT!

27:23.761 --> 27:25.263
IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF IT'S FROZEN OR NOT?
NO!

27:25.263 --> 27:27.201
BUT YOUR DAUGHTER
HAS THE REINS.

27:27.201 --> 27:29.270
SHE HAS 100% CONTROL NOW.

27:29.270 --> 27:32.475
BEFORE YOU SAID THAT ANDREA
WOULDN'T LAST ANY LONGER

27:32.475 --> 27:34.279
THAN THREE MONTHS
ON HER OWN.

27:34.279 --> 27:34.712
BUT WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU,
ANDREA,

27:34.712 --> 27:36.081
BUT WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU,
ANDREA,

27:36.081 --> 27:37.284
YOU NO READY
TO TAKE OVER.

27:37.284 --> 27:38.351
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

27:38.351 --> 27:39.353
HOW YOU FEELING NOW?

27:39.353 --> 27:40.755
I THINK SHE'S GONNA LAST

27:40.755 --> 27:41.758
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

27:41.758 --> 27:43.027
YEAH.

27:43.027 --> 27:44.194
AND SHE LOVES
THE BUSINESS.

27:44.194 --> 27:46.165
YEAH.
WHEN YOU LOVE WHAT YOU DO...

27:46.165 --> 27:47.466
ABSOLUTELY.
YOU CANNOT GO WRONG.

27:47.466 --> 27:50.405
YOU, IN GENERAL, I MEAN,
YOU LOOK LESS STRESSED

27:50.405 --> 27:51.539
THAN YOU DID
LAST TIME.

27:51.539 --> 27:53.243
I'M LOOKIN' FORWARD TO GO BACK

27:53.243 --> 27:55.178
TO BUSINESS
VERY, VERY SOON, YOU KNOW?

27:55.178 --> 27:57.149
YEAH.
I WANT TO DO
THE COOKING THIS TIME.

27:57.149 --> 27:59.252
SO, ARE YOU GONNA BE OPENING
A NEW RESTAURANT?

27:59.252 --> 28:00.755
YUP.
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE
IN THE KITCHEN?

28:00.755 --> 28:02.124
- YUP.
- ME.

28:02.124 --> 28:03.158
I KNOW,
BUT WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

28:03.158 --> 28:04.712
WILL YOU BE USING FRESH SCALLOPS
OR FROZEN?

28:04.712 --> 28:05.196
WILL YOU BE USING FRESH SCALLOPS
OR FROZEN?

28:05.196 --> 28:07.465
SHELLFISH IS SOMETHING
YOU NEVER FREEZE,

28:07.465 --> 28:09.469
AND NOW HERE YOU ARE
LECTURING ME

28:09.469 --> 28:11.305
THAT THAT  THING
IS FRESH!

28:11.305 --> 28:13.576
100% FRESH, AS ALWAYS.

28:13.576 --> 28:16.514
I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA GET UPSET
WITH THIS.

28:16.514 --> 28:18.149
I'LL SAY IT QUIETLY.

28:18.149 --> 28:19.820
DO YOU STILL THINK
THE FROZEN SCALLOPS

28:19.820 --> 28:21.722
TASTE BETTER THAN FRESH?
ABSOLUTELY.

28:21.722 --> 28:23.191
HELL.

28:23.191 --> 28:24.728
NO.
FRESH AS ALWAYS.

28:24.728 --> 28:27.198
FRESH AS ALWAYS.
YEAH.

28:27.198 --> 28:28.567
EXCUSE ME.

28:28.567 --> 28:31.038
CHEF RAMSAY,
WELCOME TO THE HITCHING POST.

28:31.038 --> 28:32.172
WELCOME.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

28:32.172 --> 28:33.340
TOM, LET'S CATCH UP LATER.

28:33.340 --> 28:34.610
ALL RIGHT.
OKAY?

28:34.610 --> 28:34.712
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

28:34.712 --> 28:36.146
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

28:36.146 --> 28:37.214
LIKEWISE.
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

28:37.214 --> 28:38.416
THANK YOU.
YES.

28:38.416 --> 28:40.219
EXCELLENT. SIT DOWN, PLEASE.
YES.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.554
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.
SO GOOD TO SEE YOU.

28:41.554 --> 28:43.324
I'M SO HAPPY TO BE BACK.
DARLING.

28:43.324 --> 28:44.459
CHEF RAMSAY.
SIT DOWN.

28:44.459 --> 28:46.095
THIS IS A QUICK CATCH-UP.
YUP.

28:46.095 --> 28:47.531
FIRST OF ALL, LADIES,
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

28:47.531 --> 28:49.167
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
YOU AS WELL.

28:49.167 --> 28:50.536
TOM HAS LEFT THE BUILDING.

28:50.536 --> 28:52.839
TOM IS GONE.
GREAT NEWS!

28:52.839 --> 28:54.075
IT REALLY IS.
YEAH.

28:54.075 --> 28:55.209
FANTASTIC.
YES.

28:55.209 --> 28:56.679
AND, ANDREA, TELL ME
ABOUT HER PERFORMANCE.

28:56.679 --> 28:58.181
I'M SO PROUD OF HER.
SHE HAS STEPPED UP.

28:58.181 --> 28:59.216
SERIOUSLY.
WOW.

28:59.216 --> 29:00.485
BIG DIFFERENCE THAT I SEE

29:00.485 --> 29:02.821
IS SHE'S MANAGING THE BUSINESS.

29:02.821 --> 29:04.258
YES.
IN THE PAST,

29:04.258 --> 29:04.712
THE WHOLE BUSINESS
WAS IN TOM'S HEAD.

29:04.712 --> 29:05.660
THE WHOLE BUSINESS
WAS IN TOM'S HEAD.

29:05.660 --> 29:08.766
MM-HMM.
TOM RUNS A BUSINESS HIS WAY,

29:08.766 --> 29:11.235
AND HE'S NOT OPEN
TO ALTERNATIVE IDEAS.

29:12.404 --> 29:14.341
WE LOOK FORWARD
TO COMING TO WORK.
MM-HMM.

29:14.341 --> 29:16.311
THAT'S NICE, AND THE MEATLOAF
IS FLYING OUT THE WINDOW.

29:16.311 --> 29:17.412
IT'S FRESH.
IT'S FRESH.

29:17.412 --> 29:20.250
DELICIOUS.
NOT LYING TO MY CUSTOMERS.

29:20.250 --> 29:22.587
OH, MEATLOAF.
WHEN WAS THIS ONE MADE?

29:22.587 --> 29:24.224
THIS WAS MADE TODAY.

29:24.224 --> 29:25.625
ARE YOU SURE
THAT WAS MADE TODAY, DARLING?

29:25.625 --> 29:27.764
IT WAS NOT, CHEF.

29:27.764 --> 29:29.332
IT'S FROZEN. YES.
IT'S FROZEN.

29:29.332 --> 29:31.168
FROZEN.
CARLA, WHY YOU DOING THIS TO ME?

29:31.168 --> 29:32.571
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

29:32.571 --> 29:34.507
- NO FIBS TODAY.
- NO FIBS TODAY.

29:34.507 --> 29:34.712
I PROMISE YOU IT'S FRESH.
YOU PROMISE ME?

29:34.712 --> 29:36.444
I PROMISE YOU IT'S FRESH.
YOU PROMISE ME?

29:36.444 --> 29:39.649
I, CARLA, SWEAR THE FOOD HERE

29:39.649 --> 29:41.318
AT THE OLDE HITCHING POST
RESTAURANT IS FRESH.

29:41.318 --> 29:43.622
FRESH.
THE FEEDBACK IS EXCELLENT.

29:43.622 --> 29:44.757
FOOD, EVERYTHING.
RIGHT.

29:44.757 --> 29:46.459
GREAT.
IT'S SO NICE TO SEE YOU BOTH.

29:46.459 --> 29:47.662
YOU TOO.
HONESTLY.

29:47.662 --> 29:49.632
THANK YOU FOR STOPPING BACK.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

29:49.632 --> 29:51.602
I'D LIE A LOT TO MY CUSTOMERS.

29:51.602 --> 29:53.238
"EVERYTHING WAS FRESH,"
I WAS TOLD TO SAY.

29:53.238 --> 29:54.273
NOW WE CAN BE HONEST.

29:54.273 --> 29:55.674
THE MEATLOAF HERE IS FRESH.

29:55.674 --> 29:57.779
IT'S NOT
LIKE THOSE GREEK MARACAS.

29:57.779 --> 29:59.882
I WANT YOU TO
LOVE MY MEATLOAF.

29:59.882 --> 30:01.518
YEAH.

30:01.518 --> 30:03.120
YOU HEAR THE LITTLE MARACAS?

30:03.120 --> 30:04.712
HI, CHEF.

30:04.712 --> 30:05.090
HI, CHEF.

30:05.090 --> 30:07.561
OUR NEW HOUSE FAVORITE,
FRESH MEATLOAF.

30:07.561 --> 30:10.199
OH, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

30:10.199 --> 30:11.802
SO, MEATLOAF.
WOW.

30:11.802 --> 30:14.105
I MEAN, PRESENTATION,
IT LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.

30:14.105 --> 30:15.239
SO, HOW IRONIC IS THAT?

30:15.239 --> 30:16.376
DAD'S GONE TO CHANGE
THE DIAPER...

30:16.376 --> 30:18.879
YOU'RE RUNNING THE BUSINESS.

30:18.879 --> 30:20.715
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.

30:20.715 --> 30:22.285
I MEAN, SOMETHING
THAT DEFINITELY MAKES YOU WANT

30:22.285 --> 30:23.720
TO GET OUT OF YOUR HOUSE.

30:23.720 --> 30:24.722
HOW IS THAT MEATLOAF?

30:24.722 --> 30:27.126
IT TASTES LIKE A TV DINNER

30:27.126 --> 30:28.128
THAT I GIVE MY THREE-YEAR-OLD.

30:28.128 --> 30:29.263
YEAH.
THAT'S BEING POLITE.

30:29.263 --> 30:31.333
PRETTY AMAZING.
THAT WAS MY BIGGEST THING,

30:31.333 --> 30:33.269
IS JUST GIVE PEOPLE
REALLY GOOD FOOD

30:33.269 --> 30:34.604
SO THAT THEY WANT TO COME BACK
ALL THE TIME.

30:34.604 --> 30:34.712
WELL, YOU'VE GOT GREAT FOOD.
WE DO.

30:34.712 --> 30:36.642
WELL, YOU'VE GOT GREAT FOOD.
WE DO.

30:36.642 --> 30:38.277
AND A GREAT BUILDING.
MM-HMM.

30:38.277 --> 30:39.446
WITH A GREAT OWNER.
THANK YOU.

30:39.446 --> 30:40.447
I'M SO HAPPY
THAT YOU CAME BACK.

30:40.447 --> 30:42.151
HAVING CHEF RAMSAY

30:42.151 --> 30:43.720
COME IN HERE AGAIN
AND GIVE US HIS APPROVAL

30:43.720 --> 30:46.725
WAS LIKE A BREATH OF FRESH AIR,
AND IT JUST GAVE ME THE POWER

30:46.725 --> 30:48.361
AND THE WILL TO WANT TO DO MORE.

30:48.361 --> 30:49.562
FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATULATIONS,

30:49.562 --> 30:50.564
YEAH?
WELL DONE.

30:50.564 --> 30:51.566
THANK YOU.
AND KEEP IT UP.

30:53.568 --> 30:54.704
COME HERE, YOU.
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

30:54.704 --> 30:55.807
YOU GREEK GOD, YOU.

30:55.807 --> 30:57.675
HONESTLY.
YOU'RE STRONG AS AN OX.

30:57.675 --> 30:59.712
GOOD LUCK
WITH THE NEW RESTAURANT.

30:59.712 --> 31:01.916
THANK YOU SO MUCH, AND IT WAS
MY PLEASURE MEETING YOU.

31:01.916 --> 31:04.253
TAKE CARE.
YES.

31:04.253 --> 31:04.712
BYE NOW.
THANK YOU.

31:04.712 --> 31:05.322
BYE NOW.
THANK YOU.

31:05.322 --> 31:07.324
THANK YOU.

31:08.660 --> 31:11.231
I ALWAYS KNEW THAT ANDREA
HAD IT IN HER TO RUN

31:11.231 --> 31:12.700
THE OLDE HITCHING POST,
BUT I'M MORE THRILLED

31:12.700 --> 31:15.170
THAT TOM ACTUALLY LET HER TAKE
OVER AND RUN THE BUSINESS.

31:15.170 --> 31:17.842
NOW SHE'S PROVEN SHE'S A GREAT
OWNER BY MAKING A BIG SUCCESS

31:17.842 --> 31:20.813
OF THIS AMAZING RESTAURANT,
AND SHE'S EVEN MADE HER FATHER

31:20.813 --> 31:23.918
SO PROUD TOO,
SO GOOD ON HER.

31:26.889 --> 31:29.695
COMING UP, CHEF RAMSAY
HEADS BACK TO CHECK IN

31:29.695 --> 31:32.365
ON PROHIBITION GASTROPUB.
UH, WHERE'S RISHI?

31:32.365 --> 31:34.403
AND TO SEE WHAT OWNER RISHI
HAS BEEN UP TO.

31:34.403 --> 31:34.712
- OH, NO.
- BUT WHAT HE SEES...

31:34.712 --> 31:35.838
- OH, NO.
- BUT WHAT HE SEES...

31:35.838 --> 31:37.840
GONNA BE RIGHT WITH YOU.

31:37.840 --> 31:39.878
MAY HAVE HIM WISHING
HE HAD NEVER GONE BACK.

31:39.878 --> 31:42.214
OH, NO.
I'M GOING.

31:49.475 --> 31:51.078
EVERETT, WASHINGTON--

31:51.078 --> 31:55.018
HOME TO THE PROHIBITION GRILLE
AND BELLY DANCER...

31:55.018 --> 32:00.160
RISHI BROWN, WHO WAS VERY KEEN
TO SHOW US ALL HER MOVES.

32:00.160 --> 32:03.497
UNFORTUNATELY,
NOT IN A GOOD WAY.

32:03.497 --> 32:06.569
UM, HAVE YOU JUST BEEN
TO A PARTY, OR--

32:06.569 --> 32:09.207
NO. I JUST GOT ALL DRESSED UP
JUST FOR YOU TODAY.

32:09.207 --> 32:11.545
OH, SO YOU JUST--YOU DON'T DRESS
LIKE THAT NORMALLY?

32:11.545 --> 32:13.080
NO, I DO DRESS LIKE THIS
NORMALLY.

32:13.080 --> 32:14.083
OH, YOU DO DRESS LIKE THAT
NORMALLY?

32:14.083 --> 32:15.484
YEAH.
WOW.

32:15.484 --> 32:15.695
I WAS HOPIN' SHE PAID
AS MUCH ATTENTION

32:15.695 --> 32:16.585
I WAS HOPIN' SHE PAID
AS MUCH ATTENTION

32:16.585 --> 32:18.054
TO HER FOOD
AS SHE DID HER OUTFIT.

32:18.054 --> 32:20.092
WHAT'S THE SOUP OF THE DAY?

32:20.092 --> 32:21.461
THE SOUP OF THE DAY
IS JALAPENO CORN CHOWDER.

32:21.461 --> 32:22.595
MM-HMM.
WHAT WAS IT YESTERDAY?

32:22.595 --> 32:23.931
JALAPENO CORN CHOWDER.

32:23.931 --> 32:24.966
OH, SO SOUP EVERY TWO DAYS?

32:24.966 --> 32:26.168
AND LAST WEEK.

32:26.168 --> 32:28.940
OH, SO SOUP OF THE WEEK.
IT'S SOUP OF THE WEEK.

32:28.940 --> 32:30.775
I QUICKLY LEARNT
THAT SHE DIDN'T KNOW

32:30.775 --> 32:32.578
THE DEFINITION
OF "SOUP OF THE DAY."

32:32.578 --> 32:34.081
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

32:34.081 --> 32:37.755
"SOUP OF THE DAY"
MEANS A DAILY CHANGING SOUP.

32:39.823 --> 32:42.193
OH.

32:42.193 --> 32:45.695
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
"SOUP OF THE DAY" MEANT.

32:45.695 --> 32:46.801
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
"SOUP OF THE DAY" MEANT.

32:46.801 --> 32:50.073
I THOUGHT THAT JUST MEANT WHAT
SOUP WE WERE SERVING THAT DAY.

32:50.073 --> 32:51.208
WOW.

32:51.208 --> 32:53.211
YEAH.
THAT WAS LAME.

32:54.848 --> 32:58.020
SOUP OF THE DAY.

32:58.020 --> 33:00.223
A NEW SOUP EVERY DAY.

33:00.223 --> 33:02.561
OKAY. I'M GOING TO TALK
TO HIM ABOUT THAT.

33:02.561 --> 33:03.964
WOW.

33:03.964 --> 33:06.099
AT THAT POINT I COULD HAVE
LEFT THERE AND THEN.

33:06.099 --> 33:07.937
I DIDN'T REALIZE
HOW CLUELESS SHE WAS.

33:07.937 --> 33:09.505
I'M NOT THAT STUPID.

33:09.505 --> 33:11.710
IT'S JUST THAT'S WHAT
I UNDERSTOOD THAT MEANT.

33:11.710 --> 33:14.046
THE FRIGHTENING THING
WAS THAT RISHI DIDN'T THINK

33:14.046 --> 33:15.695
THERE WAS ANYTHING WRONG.
BUT I LIKED IT.

33:15.695 --> 33:15.848
THERE WAS ANYTHING WRONG.
BUT I LIKED IT.

33:15.848 --> 33:19.021
I THOUGHT IT LOOKED NICE AND
KIND OF UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT.

33:19.021 --> 33:22.059
THEN AGAIN, SHE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT SOUP OF THE DAY WAS.

33:22.059 --> 33:23.627
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY!

33:23.627 --> 33:26.233
I LIKE THE FOOD.
I THINK THE FOOD IS GREAT HERE.

33:26.233 --> 33:28.168
I DIDN'T KNOW WHY SHE
WASN'T LISTENING TO ME.

33:28.168 --> 33:30.939
I WANTED TO SEE DINNER SERVICE
IN ACTION.

33:30.939 --> 33:33.211
I KNEW I WAS IN FOR A SHOW,
BUT, TRUST ME,

33:33.211 --> 33:35.179
NOT THAT KIND OF A SHOW.

33:35.179 --> 33:36.984
YOU ARE KIDDING ME.

33:38.619 --> 33:40.155
ARE YOU  SERIOUS?

33:40.155 --> 33:41.992
I AM NOT JOKING, YO.

33:44.161 --> 33:45.695
CLOSE THE DOORS.
IT'S PUTTING ME OFF MY DINNER.

33:45.695 --> 33:46.065
CLOSE THE DOORS.
IT'S PUTTING ME OFF MY DINNER.

33:46.065 --> 33:47.634
ME.

33:47.634 --> 33:50.672
IT WASN'T JUST A BELLY FLOP
IN THE DINING ROOM.

33:50.672 --> 33:52.909
OH, MY GOD.

33:52.909 --> 33:54.745
IT WAS IN THE KITCHEN AS WELL.

33:54.745 --> 33:56.049
LOOK AT THAT.

33:56.049 --> 33:57.884
DRY AS ANYTHING.

33:57.884 --> 34:01.090
THEIR MEAT'S, COOKED AND RAW,
ON THE SAME SHELF.

34:01.090 --> 34:03.193
RULE NUMBER ONE--
CROSS-CONTAMINATION.

34:03.193 --> 34:04.829
EXPLAIN TO RISHI.

34:04.829 --> 34:07.199
NEVER STORE A COOKED PRODUCT
NEXT TO A RAW PRODUCT.

34:07.199 --> 34:08.268
WHAT IS THIS, GUYS?

34:08.268 --> 34:09.736
- OH, MY GOD.
- IT'S TROUT.

34:09.736 --> 34:11.173
WHAT IS THAT?
NEW TROUT, OLD TROUT.

34:11.173 --> 34:14.846
AND THAT THERE IS THE FRESH ONE
UNDERNEATH, RIGHT?

34:14.846 --> 34:15.695
OH, MY GOD.

34:15.695 --> 34:16.981
OH, MY GOD.

34:16.981 --> 34:18.884
I COULDN'T LET IT GO ON
ANY LONGER.

34:18.884 --> 34:20.855
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
I AM SORRY.

34:20.855 --> 34:23.025
I AM SO DISAPPOINTED,

34:23.025 --> 34:25.229
BUT, WHATEVER YOU'RE EATING NOW,
JUST STOP.

34:25.229 --> 34:26.898
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
LET'S GO.

34:26.898 --> 34:30.204
RISHI FINALLY STARTED TO SEE
THAT THIS PLACE

34:30.204 --> 34:31.572
WAS IN SERIOUS TROUBLE.

34:31.572 --> 34:34.644
I SHOULD FEEL SORRY FOR YOU.
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

34:34.644 --> 34:36.747
YOU'RE BEING USED.

34:36.747 --> 34:37.782
STEP UP.
YEAH.

34:37.782 --> 34:39.118
GET A GRIP.
YEAH.

34:39.118 --> 34:41.989
'CAUSE TIME, RIGHT NOW,
IS NOT YOUR FRIEND.

34:41.989 --> 34:44.527
SO, THE NEXT DAY,
RISHI STEPPED UP

34:44.527 --> 34:45.695
AND DECIDED TO MAKE
SOME BIG CHANGES.

34:45.695 --> 34:46.029
AND DECIDED TO MAKE
SOME BIG CHANGES.

34:46.029 --> 34:48.232
I DON'T WANT TO BEAT
AROUND THE BUSH ABOUT IT.

34:48.232 --> 34:53.074
UNFORTUNATELY
I'M LETTING YOU GO.

34:53.074 --> 34:54.743
I'M SORRY.

34:54.743 --> 34:58.114
AFTER SEEING THAT RISHI WAS
SERIOUS ABOUT BEING AN OWNER,

34:58.114 --> 35:00.186
I WAS READY TO TURN
PROHIBITION GRILLE

35:00.186 --> 35:02.855
INTO EVERETT'S
FIRST EVER GASTROPUB.

35:02.855 --> 35:04.660
SO, I TRANSFORMED THE DECOR...

35:04.660 --> 35:07.229
OH, MY GOD.

35:09.167 --> 35:11.170
PROHIBITION GRILLE
IS NO LONGER A GRILL.

35:11.170 --> 35:12.705
WELCOME TO YOUR NEW GASTROPUB

35:14.108 --> 35:15.310
DESIGNED A STUNNING MENU...

35:15.310 --> 35:15.695
OH, MY GOD.
OH, WOW.

35:15.695 --> 35:18.282
OH, MY GOD.
OH, WOW.

35:18.282 --> 35:19.851
YUM.
OH, MY GOD.

35:19.851 --> 35:21.085
THAT WAS AMAZING.

35:21.085 --> 35:22.655
AND GAVE RISHI A NEW LOOK.

35:22.655 --> 35:23.891
WOW, YOU LOOK AMAZING.

35:23.891 --> 35:24.992
THANKS.

35:24.992 --> 35:26.328
I LOVE IT.

35:26.328 --> 35:28.331
AT THE RE-LAUNCH,
RISHI PROVED

35:28.331 --> 35:30.869
THAT SHE COULD TAKE CHARGE
OF THE RESTAURANT.

35:30.869 --> 35:33.272
FIRE LEFT ONE, PLEASE.
LEFT ONE HEARD.

35:33.272 --> 35:35.609
ALL RIGHT, AND THE SALMON
FOR YOU, MY DEAR.

35:35.609 --> 35:37.312
THAT BOURBON GLAZE
IS FANTASTIC.

35:37.312 --> 35:38.615
GOOD NIGHT, MY DARLING.
OKAY.

35:38.615 --> 35:39.649
GOOD NIGHT, CHEF RAMSAY.
TAKE CARE.

35:39.649 --> 35:41.319
THANK YOU.

35:45.192 --> 35:45.695
I'M HERE IN EVERETT, WASHINGTON
TO CHECK IN

35:45.695 --> 35:47.329
I'M HERE IN EVERETT, WASHINGTON
TO CHECK IN

35:47.329 --> 35:50.234
ON THE PROHIBITION GASTROPUB,
AND ITS OWNER RISHI.

35:50.234 --> 35:52.838
NOW, LAST TIME I WAS HERE,
GASTROPUBS WERE FAIRLY NEW

35:52.838 --> 35:54.974
TO THIS PART OF TOWN,
SO IT'LL BE INTERESTING

35:54.974 --> 35:57.846
TO FIND OUT HOW THE LOCALS TOOK
TO THE NEW PROHIBITION,

35:57.846 --> 36:00.783
BUT, MORE IMPORTANTLY,
DID RISHI STICK TO HER PROMISE

36:00.783 --> 36:02.353
WITH NO MORE BELLY DANCING?

36:02.353 --> 36:05.024
TIME TO CHECK IN.

36:13.571 --> 36:15.975
LAST YEAR, PROHIBITION GRILLE
OWNER RISHI HAD TO BE ONE

36:15.975 --> 36:18.012
OF THE MOST CLUELESS
RESTAURATEURS I'VE EVER MET,

36:18.012 --> 36:20.082
AND IT TOOK A LOT OF
CONVINCING TO GET HER TO STEP

36:20.082 --> 36:22.686
OUT OF THAT BELLY DANCING
COSTUME AND INTO THE ROLE

36:22.686 --> 36:25.924
OF RUNNING HER RESTAURANT,
BUT WE DID IT,

36:25.924 --> 36:28.963
AND I'M BACK AND VERY ANXIOUS
TO SEE HOW SHE'S DOING.

36:28.963 --> 36:29.930
FINGERS CROSSED.

36:31.668 --> 36:32.735
HI, HOW ARE YOU?
HI!

36:32.735 --> 36:33.804
GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?
WOW. VERY WELL.

36:33.804 --> 36:34.806
WELCOME BACK
TO THE PROHIBITION.

36:34.806 --> 36:36.175
I AM SO HAPPY
TO BE BACK HERE.

36:36.175 --> 36:37.666
YEAH.
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

36:37.666 --> 36:37.778
YEAH.
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

36:37.778 --> 36:39.247
YEAH.
IT'S BEEN GREAT.

36:39.247 --> 36:40.247
IT LOOKS GORGEOUS.

36:40.247 --> 36:41.650
UH, WHERE'S RISHI?

36:43.820 --> 36:45.189
OH, NO.
IS THAT THE MUSIC?

36:45.189 --> 36:46.359
THAT'S THE--
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

36:46.359 --> 36:48.861
OH, NO.

36:48.861 --> 36:50.666
SHE PROMISED ME NO MORE--

36:50.666 --> 36:52.101
GORDON, I'LL BE RIGHT
WITH YOU!

36:52.101 --> 36:54.137
YOU--YOU PRO--

36:54.137 --> 36:57.076
JUST KIDDING,
CHEF RAMSAY.

36:57.076 --> 36:58.811
YOU ARE SO BAD.

36:58.811 --> 37:02.017
I WAS SO EXCITED,
AND THEN I GOT REALLY NERVOUS.

37:02.017 --> 37:03.953
I KNOW.
I'M SORRY, GORDON.

37:03.953 --> 37:05.155
THANK YOU FOR COMING.

37:05.155 --> 37:07.666
OH, GOSH.
I'M SORRY.

37:07.666 --> 37:07.692
OH, GOSH.
I'M SORRY.

37:07.692 --> 37:08.961
YOU LOOK GREAT.
THE RESTAURANT'S BUSY.

37:08.961 --> 37:12.100
THANK YOU, CHEF RAMSAY.
AND YOU LOOK LIKE AN OWNER.

37:12.100 --> 37:13.102
THANK YOU.

37:13.102 --> 37:14.971
SMART AND...
OKAY. HEY.

37:14.971 --> 37:16.073
TUCKED AWAY.
YOU LOOK GREAT.

37:16.073 --> 37:17.242
ALL RIGHT. GOOD.
THAT LOOKS AMAZING.

37:17.242 --> 37:19.111
THANK YOU.
IN GENERAL, HOW'S BUSINESS?

37:19.111 --> 37:21.949
LITTLE BY LITTLE,
IT'S CATCHING ON FIRE.

37:21.949 --> 37:23.017
LET'S GO AND CATCH UP,
SHALL WE?

37:23.017 --> 37:24.018
SOMEWHERE NICE AND QUIET.
OKAY.

37:24.018 --> 37:27.291
I'M REALLY SO EXCITED TODAY

37:27.291 --> 37:30.296
BECAUSE I REALLY WANT TO SHOW
CHEF RAMSAY WHAT I'VE DONE.

37:30.296 --> 37:31.766
I'M NOT THIS CLUELESS,
YOU KNOW,

37:31.766 --> 37:34.670
BELLY DANCER-TURNED-
RESTAURATEUR.

37:34.670 --> 37:35.973
FIRST OF ALL,
CONGRATULATIONS.

37:35.973 --> 37:37.106
THE PLACE LOOKS AMAZING.
THANK YOU.

37:37.106 --> 37:37.666
NO MORE BELLY DANCING,
RIGHT?

37:37.666 --> 37:38.275
NO MORE BELLY DANCING,
RIGHT?

37:38.275 --> 37:40.780
NO MORE BELLY DANCING.
EXCELLENT.

37:40.780 --> 37:42.382
YES.
HOW ARE YOU DOING PERSONALLY?

37:42.382 --> 37:43.951
OH, MY GOSH.

37:43.951 --> 37:45.087
WELL, I'M GONNA TELL YOU,
I'VE BEEN WORKING

37:45.087 --> 37:46.823
AROUND THE CLOCK HERE
SINCE YOU LEFT.

37:46.823 --> 37:48.859
NOW I'M TOTALLY
AN OWNER HERE.

37:48.859 --> 37:50.061
RIGHT.

37:50.061 --> 37:51.696
I'M INVOLVED IN WHAT'S
GOING ON IN MY KITCHEN.

37:51.696 --> 37:53.735
YEAH.
I'M INVOLVED IN THE ORDERING.

37:53.735 --> 37:56.238
I MEAN, MY CONSULTING CHEF
MARQUETTA SHRECK,

37:56.238 --> 37:57.941
SHE'S SPECTACULAR.

37:57.941 --> 37:59.177
IT'S CHANGED MY LIFE.
IT'S AWESOME.

37:59.177 --> 38:01.113
I'M SO PLEASED TO HEAR
BECAUSE YOU WERE SO DISTANT...

38:01.113 --> 38:02.781
OH, MY GOD.
YOU HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS GOING IN THERE.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.151
I HAD NO IDEA.

38:04.151 --> 38:06.755
YOU ARE CLOSER TO THE BUSINESS
THAN EVER BEFORE.

38:06.755 --> 38:07.666
OH, THERE'S NO COMPARISON...
WOW. WOW. WOW.

38:07.666 --> 38:09.159
OH, THERE'S NO COMPARISON...
WOW. WOW. WOW.

38:09.159 --> 38:11.095
CHEF RAMSAY.
RIGHT. I'M GONNA QUIZ YOU.

38:11.095 --> 38:13.066
OH, GOSH.
OKAY.

38:13.066 --> 38:15.236
FIRST QUESTION, WHAT'S THE SOUP
OF THE DAY?

38:17.139 --> 38:20.979
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
"SOUP OF THE DAY" MEANT.

38:20.979 --> 38:24.084
IT'S A SOUP MADE
FRESH DAILY.

38:24.084 --> 38:26.720
AND WHAT
DOES THE WORD "FRESH? MEAN?

38:26.720 --> 38:28.992
"FRESH" MEANS--

38:28.992 --> 38:32.196
I THOUGHT FRESH MEANS
THAT IT'S NOT FROZEN.

38:32.196 --> 38:35.803
FOOD AT THE PEAK OF ITS LIFE.

38:35.803 --> 38:36.971
THAT'S WHAT IT MEANS TO ME.

38:36.971 --> 38:37.666
FOOD THAT IS
BEAUTIFUL, VIBRANT.

38:37.666 --> 38:39.877
FOOD THAT IS
BEAUTIFUL, VIBRANT.

38:39.877 --> 38:42.045
HOW DO YOU GROW OYSTERS?

38:42.045 --> 38:43.148
OH, MY GOODNESS.

38:43.148 --> 38:44.917
YOU DON'T MAKE AN OYSTER.
YOU JUST OPEN THEM.

38:44.917 --> 38:45.952
HUH?

38:45.952 --> 38:47.256
YES.
IN THE SHELL.

38:47.256 --> 38:49.291
WE GROW THEM
IN THE SHELL IN THE OCEAN.

38:49.291 --> 38:51.996
AND WHAT'S THE SECRET
OF A GOOD BELLY DANCE?

38:51.996 --> 38:54.132
YOU HAVE A GREAT SHIMMY
AND UNDULATION

38:54.132 --> 38:55.268
THAT WORK WELL TOGETHER.

38:59.308 --> 39:00.442
THAT'S UNDULATING.

39:00.442 --> 39:02.346
WHERE DOES BELLY DANCING
BELONG?

39:02.346 --> 39:03.881
IN APPROPRIATE VENUES.

39:03.881 --> 39:05.117
BRILLIANT.
NOT AT WORK.

39:05.117 --> 39:07.020
YOU'RE KEEPING YOUR BELLY
SEPARATE FROM YOUR BUSINESS.

39:07.020 --> 39:07.666
ABSOLUTELY.

39:07.666 --> 39:08.689
ABSOLUTELY.

39:08.689 --> 39:10.158
I'M SO PLEASED TO HEAR THAT.
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

39:10.158 --> 39:11.293
THANKS, CHEF RAMSAY.

39:11.293 --> 39:13.063
BEFORE I MAY HAVE BEEN
THAT NAIVE OWNER.

39:13.063 --> 39:14.866
NOT SO MUCH ANYMORE.
HE CAN QUIZ ME ALL HE WANTS.

39:14.866 --> 39:17.003
I GOT THE ANSWERS.

39:19.072 --> 39:20.909
HI, MY DARLING.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

39:20.909 --> 39:22.044
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.
LIKEWISE.

39:22.044 --> 39:23.446
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO.
HOW'S IT GOING?

39:23.446 --> 39:25.083
OH, IT'S GOING VERY WELL.
THANK YOU.

39:25.083 --> 39:27.019
HAS THIS LADY BEEN DEMANDING
ON ENFORCING HIGH STANDARDS

39:27.019 --> 39:29.222
WITH HER TEAM?
SHE'S A FORCE IN THE KITCHEN.

39:29.222 --> 39:30.223
THAT'S FOR SURE.
GREAT.

39:30.223 --> 39:31.894
YOU ARE SERIOUS.

39:31.894 --> 39:35.165
I EVEN DO A PREP SHIFT HERE
A COUPLE TIMES A WEEK.

39:35.165 --> 39:36.703
YOU PREP AS WELL?
YES.

39:36.703 --> 39:37.666
I'M IMPRESSED.
IT'S A PLEASURE MEETING YOU.

39:37.666 --> 39:38.104
I'M IMPRESSED.
IT'S A PLEASURE MEETING YOU.

39:38.104 --> 39:39.172
IT WAS GREAT
TO MEET YOU TOO.

39:40.407 --> 39:41.476
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
WELL DONE.

39:41.476 --> 39:42.912
KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.

39:42.912 --> 39:45.181
MAN, WE GOT TO GO BACK IN THERE.

39:45.181 --> 39:46.986
MY FAVORITE SPOT IN HERE.
I KNOW THAT--

39:46.986 --> 39:49.154
CLOSE THE DOOR.
IT'S PUTTING ME OFF MY DINNER.

39:51.125 --> 39:52.094
BELLY DANCE?

39:52.094 --> 39:53.795
THAT WAS A BELLY FLOP.

39:53.795 --> 39:56.133
SO, CHEF RAMSAY, WE'RE GONNA
HAVE YOU SIT RIGHT HERE...

39:56.133 --> 39:57.736
THANK YOU, MY DARLING.

39:57.736 --> 39:59.171
AND I'M GONNA GO TO THE KITCHEN

39:59.171 --> 40:00.173
AND PREPARE A MEAL FOR YOU.

40:00.173 --> 40:01.174
WOULD THAT BE OKAY?

40:01.174 --> 40:02.810
I CANNOT WAIT.

40:02.810 --> 40:04.346
I HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL THAT
I AM COOKING MYSELF FOR YOU.

40:04.346 --> 40:07.666
LAST TIME CHEF RAMSAY WAS HERE
HE DIDN'T LIKE ANYTHING

40:07.666 --> 40:08.152
LAST TIME CHEF RAMSAY WAS HERE
HE DIDN'T LIKE ANYTHING

40:08.152 --> 40:11.324
ON OUR MENU, AND TODAY
I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS,

40:11.324 --> 40:14.997
BUT I FEEL CONFIDENT
HE'S GOING TO LOVE HIS LUNCH.

40:14.997 --> 40:16.967
HEY, CHEF RAMSAY.

40:16.967 --> 40:18.106
WOW.

40:18.106 --> 40:20.810
THIS IS OUR I.P.A.
BARBEQUED SHRIMP

40:20.810 --> 40:22.812
WITH SPICY SAUSAGE
ON CREAMY YELLOW GRITS.

40:22.812 --> 40:24.281
THAT LOOKS AMAZING.
WOW.

40:24.281 --> 40:26.878
AND WE HAVE A LITTLE SAMPLE
OF THE BRAISED PORK SHOULDER

40:26.878 --> 40:28.480
WITH SPAETZLE AND...
WOW.

40:28.480 --> 40:29.883
THE WILD MUSHROOMS.

40:29.883 --> 40:30.985
TAKE A SEAT, DARLING. PLEASE.
THANK YOU.

40:30.985 --> 40:33.121
THE CREAMY GRITS
IS ONE OF MY SPECIALTIES.

40:33.121 --> 40:35.426
I MAKE THEM EVERY DAY.

40:35.426 --> 40:36.494
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

40:36.494 --> 40:37.666
THE GRITS ARE AMAZING.

40:37.666 --> 40:37.762
THE GRITS ARE AMAZING.

40:37.762 --> 40:39.399
OH, THANK YOU.

40:39.399 --> 40:40.768
WOW.

40:40.768 --> 40:42.271
THAT IS DELICIOUS.

40:42.271 --> 40:44.274
I THINK OF THIS,
AND IT REALLY DOES STAND OUT

40:44.274 --> 40:45.476
AS A TRUE GASTROPUB DISH.

40:45.476 --> 40:47.045
THANK YOU.

40:47.045 --> 40:48.114
BUT THEN I HAVE
THAT LITTLE NIGHTMARE

40:48.114 --> 40:49.450
AND THAT LITTLE FLASHBACK
TO THE SALMON.

40:49.450 --> 40:51.119
OH, MY GOD.
REMEMBER THE SALMON?

40:51.119 --> 40:52.521
THE PINWHEEL SALMON?

40:52.521 --> 40:55.158
THAT IS
DISGUSTING.

40:55.158 --> 40:57.129
I WILL NEVER FORGET
THAT DISH.

40:57.129 --> 41:00.101
I'LL NEVER FORGET WHEN YOU
ROLLED IT OUT, AND I WAS LIKE--

41:00.101 --> 41:01.269
BLOOD LINES ON THERE AS WELL.

41:01.269 --> 41:02.471
NASTY.

41:02.471 --> 41:04.274
YOU HAVE REALLY EMBRACED
THE CHANGE, HAVEN'T YOU?

41:04.274 --> 41:05.342
OH, MY GOSH.

41:05.342 --> 41:07.113
CHEF RAMSAY, I LOVE IT.

41:07.113 --> 41:07.666
AND TO SEE THAT YOU'VE GOT
ONE FOOT IN THE KITCHEN

41:07.666 --> 41:10.051
AND TO SEE THAT YOU'VE GOT
ONE FOOT IN THE KITCHEN

41:10.051 --> 41:12.187
AND YOU'RE RUNNING THE BUSINESS
FROM THE ENGINE ROOM...

41:12.187 --> 41:13.289
YEAH.
AND IN CONTROL.

41:13.289 --> 41:16.228
I AM SO ENCOURAGED
TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

41:16.228 --> 41:17.263
COME WITH ME.

41:17.263 --> 41:19.066
I'VE GOT A LITTLE SURPRISE
FOR YOU.

41:19.066 --> 41:23.507
CHEF RAMSAY REALLY HELPED ME
TO QUICKLY UNDERSTAND

41:23.507 --> 41:25.109
THAT CHANGE NEEDED TO OCCUR.

41:25.109 --> 41:27.347
IS MY MAKEUP ALL SMEARED?

41:27.347 --> 41:29.216
NO.
ARE YOU SURE?

41:29.216 --> 41:30.952
YEAH.
I'M SURE.

41:30.952 --> 41:32.188
IT LOOKS AMAZING.

41:32.188 --> 41:35.794
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
I'M SO SORRY FOR INTERRUPTING,

41:35.794 --> 41:37.463

RISHI HAS REALLY IMPRESSED ME,

42:48.116 --> 42:49.585
AND IT'S SO NICE TO SEE HER GO

42:49.585 --> 42:52.182
FROM A COMPLETELY OBLIVIOUS
OWNER TO SOMEONE WHO IS NOW

42:52.182 --> 42:54.385
IN CONTROL OF HER RESTAURANT,
BIG TIME,

42:54.385 --> 42:56.453
AND IT'S SO NICE TO SEE
THE TOWN OF EVERETT

42:56.453 --> 42:57.988
EMBRACING A TRUE GASTROPUB.

42:57.988 --> 43:01.392
LONG MAY IT CONTINUE.

43:01.392 --> 43:03.994
THANK GOD NO MORE DANCING.
