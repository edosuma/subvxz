<font color="#404040">IAN:</font> Here are some of the many things

52:36.720 --> 52:38.711
we don't know about heptapods.

52:38.880 --> 52:42.111
Greek. Hepta, "Seven. " Pod, "Foot."

52:42.240 --> 52:44.800
Seven feet. Heptapod.

52:46.240 --> 52:47.832
Who are they?

52:47.920 --> 52:50.753
Trying to answer this
in any meaningful way

52:50.880 --> 52:52.598
is hampered by the fact that,

52:52.720 --> 52:55.598
outside being able to see them
and hear them,

52:55.720 --> 52:58.757
the heptapods leave
absolutely no footprint.

53:00.480 --> 53:04.029
The chemical composition of
their spaceship is unknown.

53:04.120 --> 53:07.351
The shell emits no waste,
no gas, no radiation.

53:07.440 --> 53:10.671
Assuming that the shells
communicate with each other,

53:10.760 --> 53:13.354
they do so without detection.

53:13.440 --> 53:15.954
The air between the shells is untroubled

53:16.080 --> 53:17.991
by sonic emission or light wave.

53:19.600 --> 53:22.034
Are they scientists? Or tourists?

53:22.120 --> 53:23.519
If they're scientists,

53:23.600 --> 53:25.909
they don't seem to ask a lot of questions.

53:28.960 --> 53:31.269
Why did they park where they did?

53:31.400 --> 53:34.870
The world's most decorated
experts can't crack that one.

53:34.960 --> 53:36.552
The most plausible theory is

53:36.640 --> 53:38.119
that they chose places on Earth

53:38.240 --> 53:40.708
with the lowest incidence
of lightning strikes.

53:40.800 --> 53:42.791
But there are exceptions.

53:42.880 --> 53:44.871
The next most plausible theory is that

53:44.960 --> 53:46.552
Sheena Easton had a hit song

53:46.640 --> 53:48.153
at each of these sites in 1980.

53:48.240 --> 53:49.878
So, we just don't know.

53:52.560 --> 53:54.869
How do they communicate?

53:55.000 --> 53:58.072
Here, Louise is putting us all to shame.

53:58.160 --> 53:59.832
The first breakthrough was

53:59.920 --> 54:02.480
to discover that there's no correlation

54:02.600 --> 54:06.309
between what a heptapod says
and what a heptapod writes.

54:21.240 --> 54:23.595
Unlike all written human languages,

54:23.680 --> 54:26.194
their writing is semasiographic.

54:26.280 --> 54:29.750
It conveys meaning.
It doesn't represent sound.

54:34.320 --> 54:36.390
Perhaps they view our form of writing

54:36.480 --> 54:38.789
as a wasted opportunity,

54:38.920 --> 54:41.480
passing up a second
communications channel.

54:46.640 --> 54:49.438
We have our friends in Pakistan to thank

54:49.520 --> 54:52.512
for their study of how heptapods write,

54:52.640 --> 54:56.553
because unlike speech,
a logogram is free of time.

54:59.480 --> 55:01.471
Like their ship or their bodies,

55:01.560 --> 55:03.915
their written language has no forward

55:04.000 --> 55:05.353
or backward direction.

55:05.440 --> 55:09.319
Linguists call this
non-linear orthography,

55:09.400 --> 55:12.790
which raises the question,
"Is this how they think?"

55:14.520 --> 55:17.751
Imagine you wanted to write
a sentence using two hands,

55:17.840 --> 55:19.398
starting from either side.

55:19.480 --> 55:22.631
You would have to know
each word you wanted to use,

55:22.720 --> 55:25.518
as well as how much space
they would occupy.

55:27.760 --> 55:29.796
A heptapod can write
a complex sentence

55:29.880 --> 55:31.996
in two seconds, effortlessly.

55:32.080 --> 55:34.958
It's taken us a month
to make the simplest reply.

01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:11.910
would you change things?

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:21.993
<font color="#404040">IAN:</font> Maybe I'd say
what I feel more often.

01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:23.718
I... I don't know.

01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:41.840
You know, I've had my head
tilted up to the stars

01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:43.512
for as long as I can remember.

01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:48.554
You know what surprised me the most?

01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:52.430
It wasn't meeting them.

01:48:57.240 --> 01:48:59.435
It was meeting you.

01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:43.274
I forgot how good it
felt to be held by you.

01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:54.311
<font color="#404040">IAN:</font> You wanna make a baby?

01:50:28.600 --> 01:50:31.194
<font color="#404040"><font color="#404040">LOUISE:</font></font> Yes. Yeah.
