WEBVTT

00:06.249 --> 00:08.750
Now's the time. At 3:00 p.m.,
the suite will be empty.

00:08.833 --> 00:10.708
<i>The code to the safe is 1026.</i>

00:10.917 --> 00:13.667
You can get back everything
that was stolen from you.

00:14.750 --> 00:15.541
<i>Aloha, Pattons.</i>

00:15.750 --> 00:17.041
I came by your office
last night,

00:17.124 --> 00:18.249
but you were occupied.

00:20.166 --> 00:22.166
Did you get a chance
to look at the proposal?

00:23.416 --> 00:25.583
Greg is at the bar, and he says
he's waiting for me.

00:25.917 --> 00:28.083
That is--
That's not gonna... stay...

00:28.458 --> 00:30.083
<i>You're such a gorgeous couple,</i>

00:30.166 --> 00:31.708
<i>so be happy, okay?</i>

00:31.792 --> 00:32.999
Be happy, Rachel.

00:33.249 --> 00:35.041
<i>I think
I've made a terrible mistake.</i>

00:35.375 --> 00:36.667
I'm not in the mood anymore.

00:36.750 --> 00:38.917
<i>I'm tired of being
the fucking punching bag!</i>

00:42.625 --> 00:44.291
-Don't hurt me, don't hurt me...

02:20.124 --> 02:21.958
Wake up,
you dumb fucker!

02:22.041 --> 02:23.083
What, you homeless?

02:23.166 --> 02:25.792
Let's go, brother. We need you.

02:25.875 --> 02:28.958
Don't keep us waiting,
you fucker!

02:41.792 --> 02:43.416
Don't tip our shit over, bro.

03:21.999 --> 03:23.249
Hey, baba.

03:55.875 --> 03:58.208
Baba,
you wanna get some brekkie?

04:02.083 --> 04:03.583
Rach?

04:04.792 --> 04:07.416
I booked a facial
for this morning.

04:29.333 --> 04:30.750
What are you doing?

04:33.541 --> 04:34.667
Texting.

04:36.333 --> 04:37.541
Texting who?

04:38.999 --> 04:40.208
My sister.

04:45.083 --> 04:46.500
Is there a problem?

04:47.708 --> 04:49.833
I don't know. Is there?

04:57.750 --> 04:58.750
No.

05:10.667 --> 05:13.875
No way. Oh, my God.

05:18.041 --> 05:19.375
Hmm.

05:36.625 --> 05:39.291
This is why people
go on vacation.

05:40.500 --> 05:41.917
You were amazing.

05:43.875 --> 05:48.124
Yesterday.
Superman in a scuba suit.

05:51.041 --> 05:52.083
My hero.

06:01.875 --> 06:02.917
Thank you.

06:06.750 --> 06:10.541
<i>♪ Here I come to save the day ♪</i>

06:48.083 --> 06:49.500
Oh, my God.

06:50.458 --> 06:53.583
-Oh, boy...

07:07.875 --> 07:10.500
-Hi.
-Hi.

07:12.416 --> 07:15.333
You were on fire last night.

07:17.083 --> 07:20.750
-I was?
-Yeah, you were hilarious.

07:20.833 --> 07:22.750
You tried to get me to throw

07:22.833 --> 07:25.500
your dead mother's ashes
in the trash.

07:26.041 --> 07:27.375
Oh, my God.

07:29.208 --> 07:31.041
-Did you?
-No.

07:36.500 --> 07:39.708
You really let it all hang out.

07:46.667 --> 07:47.708
I'm okay.

07:55.708 --> 07:57.917
Hey,
they put out some fresh kiwi.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.249
-Oh.
-I got you some.

07:59.333 --> 08:01.458
-Oh, thank you, Mark.
-I know how you love it.

08:01.541 --> 08:04.249
I do. Oh, I love this kiwi.

08:04.333 --> 08:07.583
-Try one.
-Mm, mm, so sweet.

08:07.667 --> 08:10.541
-Oh, my God.
-So sweet here.

08:15.249 --> 08:16.375
What?

08:18.958 --> 08:22.583
Mr. and Mrs. Mossbacher,
how are you? Are you all right?

08:22.667 --> 08:24.333
Our deepest apologies again.

08:24.416 --> 08:27.708
And I do hope you find a way
to enjoy the rest of your trip.

08:29.750 --> 08:33.166
Uh, I heard you're taking out
the dive boat again today.

08:33.249 --> 08:35.416
That should be diverting.

08:40.583 --> 08:41.917
Morning, ladies.

08:42.708 --> 08:44.792
Did you find our medications?

08:46.375 --> 08:47.416
Afraid not.

08:53.249 --> 08:54.458
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

08:54.541 --> 08:56.416
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

08:58.500 --> 08:59.875
Hey, can I get a coffee, black?

08:59.958 --> 09:02.875
-Of course.
-Black coffee? Great.

09:02.958 --> 09:04.124
Hey, nice shiner.

09:05.708 --> 09:07.333
-Ah.
-How'd that happen?

09:07.416 --> 09:09.541
You should see the other guy.

09:09.625 --> 09:11.041
-Yeah.

09:11.124 --> 09:12.291
No, seriously.

09:12.375 --> 09:15.750
Yeah, we were going
scuba diving, my son and I.

09:15.833 --> 09:17.792
We got our PADI licenses
in the pool.

09:17.875 --> 09:19.416
And the girls and I
were gonna go, too,

09:19.500 --> 09:21.041
you know, just have a nice day
on the boat.

09:21.124 --> 09:23.291
And I decided last minute
not to go.

09:23.375 --> 09:25.999
So, I was up in the room
straightening up.

09:26.083 --> 09:28.083
And then out of nowhere,
this guy jumps out.

09:28.166 --> 09:30.458
He was in the room
trying to steal my stuff,

09:30.541 --> 09:32.750
trying to steal our jewels.
They were in the safe.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.792
So, he had gotten
into the safe somehow.

09:34.875 --> 09:37.833
He threw me to the ground
so violently.

09:37.917 --> 09:39.999
That's when I walked in.
He doesn't see me, right?

09:40.083 --> 09:41.208
He has on his scuba suit.

10:11.458 --> 10:13.083
I thought you might
like some water

10:13.166 --> 10:14.249
-while you're waiting.
-Thank you.

10:14.333 --> 10:17.625
Of course.
-Thanks.

10:17.708 --> 10:19.999
Your facialist should be out
any minute.

10:21.333 --> 10:23.708
Great. Thanks.

10:28.541 --> 10:31.249
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

10:31.333 --> 10:34.833
-Anything I can do?
-No, thank you, though.

10:34.917 --> 10:38.375
Actually, do you know if there's
any rooms available tonight?

10:38.458 --> 10:40.291
I just work at the spa,
but I'm happy to call.

10:40.375 --> 10:42.375
No, no, no, no,
that's fine. Don't.

10:42.458 --> 10:45.500
I just was curious, you know,
just in case.

10:48.041 --> 10:49.333
It's not a big deal.

10:50.667 --> 10:54.708
Just, my marriage,
you know, whatever.

11:10.375 --> 11:11.792
This is my card.

11:12.625 --> 11:13.667
That's my cell.

11:13.750 --> 11:18.416
Um, call me if you need
anything. It's Belinda.

11:19.083 --> 11:20.208
Thank you.

11:24.667 --> 11:27.541
Mrs. Patton, I'm ready for you.

11:55.124 --> 11:57.124
-Where have you been, man?
-I was on the canoe.

11:57.208 --> 11:59.249
We went all around the island.
It was cool.

11:59.333 --> 12:00.583
Well, you missed breakfast.

12:00.667 --> 12:02.875
And in an hour,
we're going scuba.

12:02.958 --> 12:06.708
I'm pretty beat.
Uh, my arms are like numb.

12:06.792 --> 12:10.458
Well, we still gotta scuba.
It's the last day we can do it.

12:10.958 --> 12:12.166
Why?

12:12.249 --> 12:13.958
'Cause we go home tomorrow.

12:14.041 --> 12:15.124
Oh.

12:16.541 --> 12:19.625
I'm thinking
I'm not going home.

12:20.958 --> 12:22.792
Yeah, I think I wanna stay here.

12:23.833 --> 12:25.583
The guys need a sixth
for their crossing

12:25.667 --> 12:27.249
'cause the guy that they've been
training with,

12:27.333 --> 12:29.041
he keeps flaking
'cause he's a drunk.

12:29.124 --> 12:32.208
And in the spring,
we're all gonna do a <i>Hokule'a</i>

12:32.291 --> 12:34.291
through all of Polynesia,
which sounds amazing.

12:34.375 --> 12:37.750
Honey, you're not going on that.
You're 16. You're in school.

12:37.833 --> 12:40.041
School's easy.
I can just finish online.

12:40.124 --> 12:42.875
This is absurd.

12:44.083 --> 12:45.708
What about your life at home?

12:45.792 --> 12:47.166
What life at home?

12:47.249 --> 12:49.792
What about us, your family?

12:50.541 --> 12:51.458
Come visit.

12:51.541 --> 12:55.041
Wait. I can't tell
if you're being serious.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.166
I'm very serious.

12:57.249 --> 12:59.792
Quinn,
is this about your phone?

12:59.875 --> 13:02.083
Because we wouldn't have
your new phone shipped here?

13:02.166 --> 13:03.208
No.

13:03.291 --> 13:04.917
Because relax, it's gonna
be there when we get home.

13:04.999 --> 13:07.708
What? Mom,
I don't care about a phone.

13:07.792 --> 13:09.166
I don't even want a phone.

13:09.249 --> 13:10.583
Well, you're getting a phone.

13:10.667 --> 13:12.166
You're not gonna
not have a phone.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.416
This is ridiculous.

13:13.500 --> 13:18.416
Look, staying here without us,
not an option, no.

13:19.667 --> 13:21.583
I support you, Quinn.

13:21.667 --> 13:24.083
Live your dream. Paddle to Fiji.

13:36.041 --> 13:37.041
Shane.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.249
Shane?

13:44.333 --> 13:46.416
Not yet,
he gave me a bullshit number.

13:47.708 --> 13:49.375
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that'd be great.

13:50.500 --> 13:51.583
No, I know.

13:52.416 --> 13:54.166
Dude, trust me, I know.

13:54.249 --> 13:56.625
<i>I'm going to call
Randy Zeoli right now.</i>

13:56.708 --> 13:59.291
Well, good.
Go scalp some heads.

13:59.375 --> 14:00.541
<i>You know I will.</i>

14:00.625 --> 14:02.249
-All right, Lorenzo.
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

14:02.333 --> 14:03.750
Thanks.

14:03.833 --> 14:07.083
It's my mom's travel agent.
The dude is hardcore.

14:08.166 --> 14:09.583
He knows one of the owners
of the hotel.

14:09.667 --> 14:11.541
He's gonna call.
He's gonna raise hell.

14:11.625 --> 14:14.166
-Why?
-Why? Listen to this.

14:14.249 --> 14:17.833
Okay, you know the family that
arrived on the boat with us,

14:17.917 --> 14:19.625
the ones you think are weird?

14:19.708 --> 14:21.416
They went back
to their room yesterday,

14:21.500 --> 14:24.625
and there's like a jewel thief
in their fucking bedroom.

14:25.541 --> 14:26.541
-What?
-Yeah.

14:26.625 --> 14:28.083
There's like
a fight and everything,

14:28.166 --> 14:30.083
and then the guy
takes all their stuff.

14:31.917 --> 14:32.833
Oh, my God.

14:32.917 --> 14:34.750
Yeah, he had a key to the room.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.333
The only reason
I know about this

14:36.416 --> 14:38.875
is 'cause the dad had a shiner
and I asked him about it.

14:38.958 --> 14:40.625
The hotel didn't tell us shit.

14:40.708 --> 14:42.291
Like, if he's got a key
to their room,

14:42.375 --> 14:45.083
he could have a key to our room.
Like, who fucking knows?

14:45.166 --> 14:46.999
-It's freaky.
I'm serious.

14:47.083 --> 14:49.083
We are in the biggest suite
at the hotel.

14:49.166 --> 14:50.792
We could be a target.

14:51.625 --> 14:54.166
I just wish I had a gun

14:54.249 --> 14:58.249
or like a baseball bat
at least, or something.

14:59.416 --> 15:01.999
You know, like, fucking...

15:02.875 --> 15:05.249
Hmm. Yes!

15:06.041 --> 15:07.166
Hold on.

15:14.458 --> 15:16.750
That's the knife they gave us
to cut the pineapples.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.792
What, are you gonna cut
a bunch of pineapples?

15:18.875 --> 15:22.541
Gonna keep this by the bed.
Gotta protect my hot wife.

15:22.625 --> 15:25.667
This Armond guy is unbelievable.
He's going down.

15:25.958 --> 15:26.917
Shane.

15:26.999 --> 15:29.500
Lorenzo's all over it.
Oh, how was your facial?

15:29.583 --> 15:31.124
Your face looks nice and shiny.

15:32.249 --> 15:33.708
-Shane.
-What?

15:40.541 --> 15:41.541
What?

15:45.249 --> 15:46.333
I...

15:47.917 --> 15:50.792
I can't believe
that I'm saying this, but, uh...

15:56.917 --> 15:58.792
I think I made a mistake.

16:02.333 --> 16:03.833
What's the mistake?

16:06.999 --> 16:08.999
The mistake is...

16:12.792 --> 16:14.375
the mistake is...

16:17.583 --> 16:18.875
getting married...

16:20.249 --> 16:21.375
to you.

16:31.708 --> 16:33.458
What?

16:33.541 --> 16:39.166
Shane, when I met you,
I was... in a weird place.

16:39.708 --> 16:41.333
And, uh...

16:41.416 --> 16:44.917
I had my bad breakup,
and work was so frustrating.

16:44.999 --> 16:46.291
And...

16:46.375 --> 16:50.416
And then you came along,
and you're so handsome,

16:50.500 --> 16:52.333
and I was so attracted to you,

16:52.416 --> 16:54.750
and you had so much
going on, and...

16:54.833 --> 16:58.708
going around the city with you
was like a fantasy.

16:59.375 --> 17:00.750
All the doors opened,

17:00.833 --> 17:03.083
and then you asked me
to marry you, and...

17:04.333 --> 17:05.917
And look, I admit,

17:05.999 --> 17:09.917
when I was little,
I had princess dolls, and...

17:09.999 --> 17:13.041
I was a girly girl and
I dreamt about my wedding day

17:13.124 --> 17:15.333
and-- and Prince Charming
and all that shit.

17:15.416 --> 17:16.667
What the fuck
are you talking about?

17:16.750 --> 17:18.375
And then I--
-Are you for real right now?

17:18.458 --> 17:20.083
And then I got caught up
in the wedding,

17:20.166 --> 17:22.500
and that was the last
five months, basically.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.792
And everyone, you know,
I could tell

17:25.875 --> 17:29.625
thought I was so lucky,
and that made me feel good.

17:29.708 --> 17:32.249
But like in the dumbest way.

17:32.625 --> 17:33.625
Because...

17:35.999 --> 17:39.166
-Because now I'm here and--
-And what?

17:39.625 --> 17:40.792
And...

17:42.833 --> 17:43.999
I realize...

17:46.625 --> 17:49.500
I don't wanna be a plus one
my whole life.

17:52.541 --> 17:55.291
Okay, so don't be.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.083
I mean, I'm not telling you
to be anything.

17:57.166 --> 17:58.792
But that's just how it is.

17:59.583 --> 18:00.708
Okay, so are you blaming me

18:00.792 --> 18:02.041
'cause you're not
more successful?

18:02.124 --> 18:03.708
No, I'm not blaming you
for anything.

18:03.792 --> 18:04.999
You've done nothing wrong.

18:05.083 --> 18:07.833
What a relief. Like...

18:08.792 --> 18:10.416
After I've wined you
and dined you

18:10.500 --> 18:11.583
and asked you to marry me,

18:11.667 --> 18:13.583
and then made you
the center of my life,

18:13.667 --> 18:16.083
it's just nice to know
you're not pissed.

18:16.166 --> 18:18.333
Shane, this is about me.

18:19.166 --> 18:22.375
I'm not okay with being
a trophy wife,

18:22.458 --> 18:26.124
an appendage like all these
other women in your world.

18:26.208 --> 18:27.416
Okay, so you're pretty

18:27.500 --> 18:29.375
and that's part of
the appeal for me,

18:29.458 --> 18:30.999
and what, that bothers you?

18:32.166 --> 18:34.375
I just need to respect myself.

18:36.416 --> 18:38.208
I gotta hand it to you.
Ah-- You--

18:39.792 --> 18:42.625
You hid yourself really well,
Rachel.

18:42.708 --> 18:43.917
I mean, this whole time,

18:43.999 --> 18:46.249
I bought that you were
this cool chick

18:46.333 --> 18:49.458
who was fun and confident
and normal.

18:49.541 --> 18:56.041
And I had no idea that you were
this insecure, naive baby.

18:57.999 --> 19:00.750
You're the baby, Shane.

19:00.833 --> 19:04.958
Coddled by your mommy,
who showed up on your honeymoon.

19:05.041 --> 19:06.541
You don't get the room you want,

19:06.625 --> 19:09.166
so you throw
a never-ending tantrum.

19:09.249 --> 19:15.875
I genuinely cannot believe
what a baby-man you can be.

19:20.208 --> 19:22.625
Okay, I'm out.

19:22.708 --> 19:24.041
I'm gonna go for a swim.

19:25.875 --> 19:26.999
Because now,

19:27.083 --> 19:29.875
we are starting down
a very dark road,

19:29.958 --> 19:32.291
and you better be sure
you really wanna go there.

20:04.416 --> 20:06.291
Mossbachers!

20:06.375 --> 20:09.541
Oh, I was hoping to catch you.
I have good news.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.625
I received a call,
and the stolen items,

20:11.708 --> 20:14.249
all your jewelry,
it's all been recovered.

20:14.333 --> 20:15.917
-Oh, that's great.
-Fantastic.

20:15.999 --> 20:17.958
There's some sort of process,
but I made them promise

20:18.041 --> 20:21.208
to give everything back to you
before your departure tomorrow.

20:21.291 --> 20:22.458
So, they found the guy?

20:23.124 --> 20:24.333
They did.

20:24.416 --> 20:26.083
Was it an employee?

20:27.124 --> 20:28.416
It was.

20:28.500 --> 20:32.500
Look, on behalf of the hotel,
I just wanna say I am so sorry.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.291
What's his name?

20:35.124 --> 20:36.124
Kai.

20:37.458 --> 20:40.541
And it's so strange,
'cause he was such a sweet kid.

20:40.625 --> 20:42.667
And I never had a problem
with him ever.

20:42.750 --> 20:45.291
I never would've guessed him
in a million years.

20:45.958 --> 20:47.458
Well, uh,

20:47.541 --> 20:50.291
I just wanted to give you the
good news about your jewelry.

20:50.375 --> 20:53.208
And I hope you have
an incredible dive.

20:53.291 --> 20:56.291
-Thanks.
-Thank you. It's great news.

20:56.375 --> 20:58.166
-It is, yes.

-What?
-Paula, cut the crap.

31:32.500 --> 31:34.625
I mean, I didn't know
why you wouldn't tell me,

31:34.708 --> 31:36.124
but I guess it's 'cause
you were planning

31:36.208 --> 31:38.208
some sort of heist or something?

31:38.291 --> 31:40.124
Are you serious?

31:40.208 --> 31:42.750
You gave him
the code to our safe.

31:44.291 --> 31:47.416
Paula, do you think
I'm some sort of idiot?

31:47.500 --> 31:50.208
You're making a big deal about
putting some cheap necklace

31:50.291 --> 31:53.166
I have never seen you wear
before in the safe.

31:53.249 --> 31:55.375
And then an hour later,
the guy you're screwing

31:55.458 --> 31:57.458
breaks into our room
and steals all of our shit.

31:57.541 --> 31:58.833
It's pretty basic.

32:03.416 --> 32:06.333
-It's not what you think.
Well, what is it?

32:08.625 --> 32:10.667
It's not like
I'm gonna rat you out.

32:12.208 --> 32:14.792
-Do you need money or something?
-No.

32:16.625 --> 32:19.041
No, it was never for me.

32:21.333 --> 32:22.625
Then what is it?

32:23.958 --> 32:27.917
I just-- You won't understand.

32:27.999 --> 32:30.999
Yes, I will.
I'm not my parents, Paula.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.208
But you are.

32:33.291 --> 32:35.750
Actually, you are.

32:35.833 --> 32:39.333
And you think you're like
this rebel, but in the end...

32:41.041 --> 32:42.375
this is your tribe.

32:44.166 --> 32:47.541

32:49.875 --> 32:52.792

You're the one who stole,
yet I'm the bad guy?

32:55.708 --> 32:58.917
Don't give me that.
You've stolen, too.

32:59.541 --> 33:00.999
What did I steal?

33:01.792 --> 33:03.124
Well, I guess it's not stealing

33:03.208 --> 33:05.249
when you think everything's
already yours.

33:09.375 --> 33:12.208
Just stop pretending
to be my friend.

for some weird cred.

Whatever you did, Paula,
it was really fucked up.

33:24.750 --> 33:27.583
My mom could've gotten
really hurt.

33:28.833 --> 33:30.708
Something bad could've happened.

33:33.083 --> 33:34.917
Something bad did happen.

Good, good, yeah.

34:51.166 --> 34:52.249
Yeah? Really?

34:52.333 --> 34:54.999
Yeah. Actually, we're
gonna go to Honolulu tomorrow.

34:55.083 --> 34:56.416
Yeah,
spend the weekend together.

34:56.500 --> 34:58.583
That is so nice.
Make sure to do some shopping.

34:58.667 --> 34:59.917

35:16.333 --> 35:19.208
you're an amazing person.
You are.

35:19.291 --> 35:21.999
I mean,
you've helped me so much.

35:22.999 --> 35:24.583
I was a mess.

35:24.667 --> 35:27.166
I showed up here, and--
and somehow,

35:27.249 --> 35:30.917
you were able to just jumpstart
my life again.

35:30.999 --> 35:34.041
And I don't think I'm ever
gonna be functional.

35:34.124 --> 35:36.958
-But I do think that now,

35:37.041 --> 35:39.416
I'll be able to break
some old patterns.

35:41.083 --> 35:42.208
Definitely.

35:45.667 --> 35:49.583
Anyway, about the business...

35:53.541 --> 35:55.625
I really need to think about it.

35:55.708 --> 36:00.917
I mean, you're so talented
and I so wanna do this for you,

36:00.999 --> 36:05.999
but I'm realizing I'm getting
back into this pattern again

36:06.083 --> 36:08.792
where I latch on to somebody

36:08.875 --> 36:12.083
and then I use my money
to control them

36:12.166 --> 36:16.041

is another
transactional relationship.

36:19.958 --> 36:24.416

it's not healthy for me,

36:25.583 --> 36:26.708
you know?

36:29.416 --> 36:34.375
Anyway, I really, I want you
to know how grateful I am

36:34.458 --> 36:38.208
