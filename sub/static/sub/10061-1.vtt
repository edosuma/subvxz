02:00.500 --> 02:01.777

02:01.845 --> 02:05.042
Non. Non, c'est trois not do it.

02:05.109 --> 02:07.760

Ah, bravo. Bravo.

02:07.829 --> 02:09.488
Ah, bravo. Voila.

02:09.558 --> 02:11.446
You are bilingue now.

02:11.510 --> 02:14.194
You're the sausage,
mate, not me.

02:16.343 --> 02:17.423
(Woman)
Non, non, do it.

02:17.495 --> 02:19.383
J'adore quand tu parle francais.

02:19.447 --> 02:21.815
You know, l-- l don't really care
what you say.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.887
lt sounds good. Heh heh.

02:23.960 --> 02:26.830
l spoke to your mom
this morning.

02:26.905 --> 02:28.432
- You spoke to my mom?
- Uh-huh.

02:28.505 --> 02:30.447
She's devious, my mother.

02:30.521 --> 02:32.376
She tried to speak French to me.

02:32.442 --> 02:34.133
What she was trying--
She was--

02:34.202 --> 02:36.275
- She was trying to nag in French.
- Yeah.

02:36.347 --> 02:38.998
- She wants to cover all bases.
- Yeah.

02:40.635 --> 02:42.424
(Man)
Why do you think she likes you so much?

02:42.491 --> 02:44.947
Because l'm the best.
Look what you had before me.

02:45.020 --> 02:46.875
Well, she didn't like any
of my other girlfriends.

02:46.940 --> 02:48.402
No. Look at me.

02:48.477 --> 02:49.721
Look at you. (chuckles)

02:49.789 --> 02:51.447
Of course she loves me.

02:51.517 --> 02:53.623
l cook well. l'm an artist.

02:53.694 --> 02:56.378
l'm French and talented,

02:56.446 --> 02:58.356
and l live with you.

02:58.430 --> 03:00.919
She told me that you had a nose job,

03:00.991 --> 03:03.991
- and l thought that was sort of gay.
- l had a what?

03:04.063 --> 03:05.689
What did l have?

03:05.760 --> 03:07.134
A nose job.

03:07.199 --> 03:08.891
- Nose job? l didn't get a nose job.
- l was--

03:08.960 --> 03:11.448
- Yes.
- She said nice job. She said l got a nice job.

03:11.521 --> 03:14.521
Yeah, nice job.
Honey, l want to see--

04:21.548 --> 04:22.759
Thank you.

04:22.829 --> 04:24.258
Thanks, mate.

04:26.797 --> 04:28.391
Ready to rock, baby?

04:28.462 --> 04:30.088
- That's it?
- That's it.

04:30.158 --> 04:32.526
So they let us take the boat out
without knowing anything?

04:32.591 --> 04:34.315
Just leave
the technical stuff to me, babe.

04:34.383 --> 04:37.100
- Okay, boss. You have a tag here.
- Come on, let's get on.

04:45.969 --> 04:47.912
Okay?

04:47.985 --> 04:50.375
Why you didn't get a bigger boat?

04:50.450 --> 04:51.792
What's wrong with this boat?

04:51.858 --> 04:55.437
lt's a beautiful
handcrafted timber boat.

04:55.507 --> 04:57.362
Old-fashioned, like me.

05:02.324 --> 05:04.364
Easy.

06:28.451 --> 06:30.273
l wish for fish

06:30.340 --> 06:33.307
for a fine fish dish.

06:35.972 --> 06:37.117
l thought you had a busy week--

06:37.188 --> 06:39.360
We dropped the case.

06:39.429 --> 06:41.404
You've dropped
the Chapman case?

06:41.477 --> 06:43.866
Well, we can't win.
Their word against hers, so...

06:43.941 --> 06:45.086
Yeah, we dropped the case.

06:45.157 --> 06:46.619
But they raped her.

06:46.694 --> 06:47.938
Well, they say they didn't do it.

06:48.006 --> 06:49.829
That's the problem with crime:
the crooks always deny it.

06:49.895 --> 06:51.684
- lt's a real bitch.
- And you're okay with this?

06:51.751 --> 06:54.118
lf it were up to me,
l'd have the shit kicked out of them,

06:54.184 --> 06:56.639
then l'd have them locked up,
but it's not up to me.

06:56.712 --> 06:58.916
- So, you get raped--
- Oh, come on, sweetheart. Can't we just--

06:58.984 --> 07:00.392
So, you get raped,
and you just forget it

07:00.457 --> 07:02.596
because the courts are
all stacked against you?

07:02.665 --> 07:05.120
Sorry, Mrs. Chapman.
Tough turkey, huh?

07:05.193 --> 07:06.852
Tough titty, babe.

07:06.922 --> 07:08.962
Titty.

07:09.034 --> 07:11.206
l don't-- l don't understand.

07:11.274 --> 07:13.608
l mean, justice. Yeah.

07:13.675 --> 07:14.853
Come on, baby.

07:14.923 --> 07:17.574
Let's have a little drink, a little topper.

07:17.643 --> 07:19.531
Whoa, Baby! That's you!
Come on! Come on! Reel it in!

07:19.596 --> 07:20.774
No, you do it!

07:20.844 --> 07:22.754
No, honey, it's your pole,
it's your fish.

07:22.828 --> 07:24.585
Just...round, round.
That bit there.

07:24.653 --> 07:25.765
lt won't go. Please do it.

07:25.836 --> 07:26.764
Give it here.

07:26.829 --> 07:29.131
l got it. Ooh, that's a monster.

07:29.198 --> 07:31.303
- lt's a big one. Whoa!
- Wha--

07:31.374 --> 07:33.382
- Yeah!
- Whoo! Whoo!

07:33.454 --> 07:34.731
No, don't kill it!

07:34.798 --> 07:37.068
No, do not! Don't kill it!

07:42.704 --> 07:43.817
lt's a flathead.

07:43.888 --> 07:46.409
That's disgusting.

07:46.481 --> 07:49.448
Yeah, well, that's fishing, baby.

08:13.589 --> 08:15.116
Weather's changed.

08:15.190 --> 08:17.230
Pushing us north.

08:17.302 --> 08:18.447
(yawning)

08:18.518 --> 08:20.144
What's happened
to our nice, sunny day, babe?

08:21.526 --> 08:23.315
(thunder rumbling in distance)

08:25.656 --> 08:28.023
Let's go back. lt's getting cold.

08:29.016 --> 08:31.831
Looks like it'll pass over.

08:31.896 --> 08:33.303
Let's swing around
those heads,

08:33.369 --> 08:36.086
come on back,
just past those mangroves.

08:36.153 --> 08:38.609
What do you reckon?

08:38.682 --> 08:40.241
Yeah, let's do it.

08:40.313 --> 08:41.655
Come on, weigh anchor.

08:54.012 --> 08:55.638
There we go.

09:01.661 --> 09:03.734
Voila.

09:03.806 --> 09:06.141
Voila.

09:14.528 --> 09:16.601
(engine starts)

09:16.672 --> 09:17.882
Voila.

11:53.723 --> 11:56.985
(thunderclap)

12:35.266 --> 12:37.787
We are lost, aren't we?

12:39.523 --> 12:41.596
Well, it's too shallow
for the outboard.

12:41.668 --> 12:43.327
l guess the tide goes out quickly around here.

12:43.396 --> 12:46.047
What does that mean?

12:46.117 --> 12:48.059
That means...

12:48.133 --> 12:49.890
that's for you...

12:50.981 --> 12:52.672
and this is for me.

12:52.741 --> 12:54.684
Okay, where are we going now?

12:54.758 --> 12:57.574
Well, we know the tide
runs back into the bay,

12:57.639 --> 12:59.614
so l guess we just go with it.

13:03.655 --> 13:05.761
(thunderclap)

13:14.602 --> 13:16.424
(Rob panting)

13:20.938 --> 13:22.313
(groans)

13:26.380 --> 13:28.289
lt's getting shallower, Rob.

13:30.252 --> 13:31.943
Where are we?

13:32.012 --> 13:33.835
We're in a drain.

13:33.901 --> 13:35.494
A what?

13:35.565 --> 13:37.475
Agricultural drain.

13:37.550 --> 13:41.609
Probably caught
in a non-eccentric drainage paddock.

13:42.574 --> 13:45.608
You bring me boating in a drain?

13:45.679 --> 13:48.232
l'm full of surprises.

13:48.303 --> 13:50.792
l think we've come
about a mile inland,

13:50.863 --> 13:54.061
so gotta be some farms
around here somewhere.

14:01.329 --> 14:02.737
What are you doing now?

14:02.802 --> 14:05.737
l'm just gonna climb up,
have a look.

14:05.811 --> 14:08.113
Just for a...look.

14:21.269 --> 14:23.604
(thunderclap)

14:33.207 --> 14:35.117
We've been going in circles.

14:35.191 --> 14:37.680
All right, l fucked up. l'm sorry.

14:37.751 --> 14:39.540
l can't believe this.

14:39.609 --> 14:41.234
We can't float, we can't walk,

14:41.304 --> 14:43.443
and-- and l'm tired now.

14:43.512 --> 14:45.301
Come on, babe.
There's nothing we can do about it.

14:45.370 --> 14:46.799
Let's just pretend we're castaways.

14:46.874 --> 14:50.420
That's what we are,
castaways, damn you.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.017
There's a building
or something up ahead.

14:52.091 --> 14:53.171
l'm gonna go scout around.

14:53.243 --> 14:54.705
You coming,
or you gonna wait here?

14:54.779 --> 14:57.846
No, l'd like to wait here, Rob,
with the crabs and mosquitoes.

14:59.228 --> 15:01.236
There's still
no reception, of course.

15:01.308 --> 15:03.894
Jesus. How many times
do l gotta apologize?

15:03.965 --> 15:06.682
(engine running, voices)

15:08.605 --> 15:10.199
Shh-shh-shh-shh.

15:12.638 --> 15:13.685
See?

15:13.758 --> 15:15.962
Stop it. Stay here. Look around.

15:17.663 --> 15:19.573
What are they doing?

15:24.480 --> 15:27.448
l don't like it. Let's go.

15:29.441 --> 15:30.423
Let's go.

15:30.497 --> 15:32.320
(screaming)

16:18.473 --> 16:20.328
Look up there.

16:25.450 --> 16:27.752
Wait here.

16:41.806 --> 16:44.010
There's a farmhouse
or something up there.

16:44.078 --> 16:44.972
lt'll be fine.

16:45.038 --> 16:46.086
- A farm?
- Yeah. Yeah.

16:46.159 --> 16:49.225
We'll get a taxi back to the car,
drinking margaritas by midday.

16:49.294 --> 16:50.571
Come on.

17:03.538 --> 17:05.807
(heavy rain)

17:46.169 --> 17:47.729
(knocking)

17:51.161 --> 17:52.591
Hello.

17:55.226 --> 17:57.332
There's nobody here.

17:57.403 --> 17:58.745
Wait here. l'll check the back.

17:58.811 --> 18:01.146
Okay. Be careful.

18:59.845 --> 19:00.739
Hey.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.977
lt's all right. lt's all right.

19:03.046 --> 19:04.508
ls anybody here?

19:04.582 --> 19:06.273
lt's okay. There's no one here.

19:06.343 --> 19:07.358
Are you sure we should be

19:07.431 --> 19:08.958
just breaking into
somebody's house?

19:09.031 --> 19:11.420
We're not breaking in.
There's no one there.

19:11.496 --> 19:13.635
Come on.

19:31.563 --> 19:32.708
Oh, my God.

19:35.148 --> 19:37.538
l think pigs live here.

19:37.612 --> 19:39.718
Any port in a storm.

19:40.877 --> 19:43.244
Oh, that's disgusting.

19:45.998 --> 19:47.689
l feel like Goldilocks.

19:49.358 --> 19:50.732
Here's your three bears.

19:57.840 --> 20:01.638
l'm gonna take a look around,
see if l can find a phone.

20:05.713 --> 20:07.623
Be careful.

20:35.670 --> 20:37.394
(clattering)

20:37.462 --> 20:39.502
(thunderclap)

21:02.619 --> 21:03.929
(switch clicks)

21:03.995 --> 21:05.239
(flies buzzing)

21:05.307 --> 21:06.387
(sigh)

21:30.368 --> 21:32.278
Ah, fuck.

22:21.576 --> 22:22.689
Rob!

22:25.098 --> 22:27.237
Rob!

22:39.980 --> 22:41.671
Somebody's outside.

22:41.740 --> 22:44.391
Come on, we gotta
get out of here. Come on.

22:48.334 --> 22:51.815
(Man)
Get out of my fucking house!

22:53.198 --> 22:56.941
Don't make me come in there
and drag you fuckers out!

23:01.456 --> 23:04.358
l'm gonna blow your
fucking brains out!

23:07.312 --> 23:08.742
Get out of the fucking house!

23:08.816 --> 23:11.021
Listen, mate, my name's Rob Brewer.
We didn't--

23:11.089 --> 23:12.715
l'm not your mate, Robert.

23:12.786 --> 23:14.280
Get the fuck out of my house!

23:15.762 --> 23:18.512
Look, we were just
out boating, and--

23:18.578 --> 23:21.099
Listen, we don't--

23:24.243 --> 23:27.440
Oh, hey. Hey.

23:27.509 --> 23:28.851
Come on, we--

23:28.917 --> 23:31.634
Now, what you fucking
doing in there, slick?

23:32.789 --> 23:35.440
We were just out, uh, boating,

23:35.509 --> 23:37.931
and, uh, you know, we, uh,

23:38.006 --> 23:39.533
we were so tired, we got lost,

23:39.606 --> 23:41.778
and we saw your light.

23:41.847 --> 23:43.221
We just thought--

23:43.287 --> 23:46.102
Thought you'd make
yourself at home, eh?

23:46.167 --> 23:47.858
No, no, no, no, no.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.782
The back door was open.
We, uh--

23:49.848 --> 23:53.165
Oh, the back door was...
the back door was open.

23:53.240 --> 23:56.274
We'd just like to use
your phone, please.

23:56.345 --> 23:58.069
That's all, all right?

23:59.705 --> 24:00.949
You don't have a phone?

24:03.898 --> 24:05.786
lf we could just get
to the nearest, um--

24:05.851 --> 24:08.885
The nearest anything's
26 mile away, slick.

24:08.955 --> 24:12.403
Well, if you fellas could take us there,

24:12.476 --> 24:14.713
l'd be happy to fix you up
for any expenses.

24:14.780 --> 24:17.236
Oh, that is rich.

24:17.309 --> 24:20.954
You're gonna fix us up
with what, slick?

24:21.022 --> 24:24.088
Well, if you could just...

24:24.158 --> 24:25.653
point us to the nearest
main road,

24:25.727 --> 24:27.582
we'll be on our way
and there won't be any trouble.

24:27.647 --> 24:28.662
(snickering)

24:28.735 --> 24:30.426
You really are lost, aren't ya?

24:30.495 --> 24:31.542
Lost, huh? Fucking!

24:31.615 --> 24:33.438
(chuckles)

24:33.504 --> 24:36.352
There's no main roads
around here, slick.

24:36.416 --> 24:38.937
You're on an island.

24:40.609 --> 24:43.806
French lsland?
We're on French lsland.

24:43.873 --> 24:45.280
When is the ferry--

24:45.345 --> 24:46.655
Shh-shh-shh.

24:48.226 --> 24:51.161
You go and get Poppy out of the truck.
You put him to bed.

24:51.235 --> 24:53.024
lf he sees these two,
he's gonna fucking freak.

24:53.091 --> 24:54.717
Fuck!

25:07.846 --> 25:10.235
Sorry about my brother there.

25:10.310 --> 25:12.831
But he gets a bit excited.

25:15.079 --> 25:16.356
Please.

25:27.945 --> 25:29.920
After all, you can't be too careful, eh?

25:29.994 --> 25:32.896
Lot of creeps come around,
bustin' into houses and shit.

25:32.970 --> 25:34.793
Please, if you could just take us--

25:34.859 --> 25:36.266
What's that?

25:36.330 --> 25:37.640
l said if you could just take us to--

25:37.707 --> 25:40.391
Oh, ha ha ha!

25:40.460 --> 25:42.369
You got yourself
a frog chick, eh?

25:43.659 --> 25:45.994
You're a real Frenchie
on French lsland, eh?

25:47.244 --> 25:50.987
Hey, doll, see this?

25:51.053 --> 25:53.836
l found him on the side of the road.

25:55.246 --> 25:56.424
You like kangaroos, darling?

25:56.494 --> 25:57.388
Yes.

25:57.454 --> 25:58.796
Yes?

25:58.863 --> 26:00.871
Want to pet him?

26:00.943 --> 26:02.950
Go on, he won't bite.

26:05.199 --> 26:06.377
Aah!

26:06.447 --> 26:07.789
(laughing)

26:07.856 --> 26:10.824
l might, though.

26:13.297 --> 26:15.272
You out boating, you say?

26:17.873 --> 26:19.467
Yeah.

26:19.538 --> 26:22.386
Her car's back at the boat harbor.

26:25.331 --> 26:29.609
Please, if you could just take us
to the nearest phone.

26:29.684 --> 26:32.718
The switchboard in Tankerton
closes at 7:30, darling.

26:32.788 --> 26:34.731
The switchboard closes?

26:36.341 --> 26:39.276
What, are you fucking deaf?

26:39.349 --> 26:41.488
Closes at 7:30!

26:43.222 --> 26:45.644
No, this isn't the city out here, slick.

26:45.718 --> 26:47.693
You're in the boonies now.

26:47.767 --> 26:50.702
We go for weeks without
seeing shit out here.

27:06.427 --> 27:08.282
That there's Poppy.

27:09.915 --> 27:11.345
Yeah, he's kind of
a tired little camper.

27:11.419 --> 27:12.467
He's had a very big day.

27:12.540 --> 27:15.322
(chuckling)

27:15.388 --> 27:16.795
This place Tankerton,

27:16.860 --> 27:18.965
if you could just take us to a hotel.

27:22.044 --> 27:24.281
What hotel's that, darlin'?

27:24.349 --> 27:28.125
Yeah, would you like the Tankerton Regency
or the lsland Hilton?

27:31.935 --> 27:34.488
So you had a bit of a look
around the property before we got here?

27:34.559 --> 27:36.469
There's, um--

27:36.544 --> 27:38.071
There's gotta be some way
we can contact someone--

27:38.144 --> 27:40.413
Come on, slick.

27:40.480 --> 27:42.936
lt's coming down
cats and dogs out there.

27:43.009 --> 27:44.536
Plenty of room here.

27:44.609 --> 27:46.911
Now, tomorrow,
l'll drive you in to Tankerton.

27:46.977 --> 27:48.504
How's that?

27:51.106 --> 27:53.178
You probably want to get out of them
clammy wet suits, or what?

27:54.850 --> 27:57.022
Yeah, look like you could use

27:57.091 --> 27:59.164
a hot shower
and some dry clothes.

27:59.236 --> 28:01.124
The both of youse.

28:02.660 --> 28:03.609
Yes, please.

28:05.189 --> 28:06.847
All right, You get started,

28:06.917 --> 28:08.674
l'll boil you up some water
for your shower.

28:08.741 --> 28:11.807
We don't want to put
you to any trouble.

28:11.877 --> 28:13.634
Oh, it's no trouble, darling.

28:13.702 --> 28:15.906
Not yet, anyway.

28:15.974 --> 28:17.862
You go on outside.

28:17.927 --> 28:19.356
Shower's on the back porch there.

28:19.431 --> 28:20.740
Towels are inside the door.

28:22.472 --> 28:24.861
Here you go.

28:24.936 --> 28:27.205
Oh, thank you.

28:30.985 --> 28:32.545
Hey, slick.

28:34.186 --> 28:35.080
What sort of car?

28:35.146 --> 28:36.040
Car?

28:36.106 --> 28:38.343
This car you got, what sort is it?

28:38.410 --> 28:40.385
lt's a Volvo 870.

28:46.316 --> 28:48.323
Go on, Volvo.

28:52.685 --> 28:55.303
Fucking Volvo!

29:03.311 --> 29:04.620
We gotta get out of here.

29:04.686 --> 29:05.897
You're telling me?

29:05.967 --> 29:07.342
We're talking cavemen here.

29:07.408 --> 29:08.455
These guys are sick.

29:08.527 --> 29:10.470
There's a shed full
of marijuana out the back.

29:11.664 --> 29:13.519
(Rob)
They're growing the stuff. A lot of it.

29:13.584 --> 29:15.592
lt's none of our business.

29:15.665 --> 29:17.574
They're not gonna let us
walk away from here.

29:17.649 --> 29:20.716
There's enough pot there
to put these guys away for 10 years.

29:22.354 --> 29:23.696
Honey, they're not gonna let us go.

29:23.762 --> 29:25.770
We gotta get the cops back here.

29:25.843 --> 29:27.883
- l knew we shouldn't have--
- Listen.

29:27.955 --> 29:29.711
They don't know that we know.

29:29.779 --> 29:31.602
Okay? Just play it cool, babe.

29:31.667 --> 29:32.715
They're the ones we saw before.

29:32.787 --> 29:34.610
What were they doing to that boy?

29:34.676 --> 29:37.164
l don't know. l don't know.

29:37.236 --> 29:39.604
My best guess would be
just to do what they say.

29:39.669 --> 29:41.295
The first chance we get,
we'll take off, okay?

29:41.366 --> 29:42.260
Okay.

29:42.326 --> 29:43.755
Okay?

29:43.830 --> 29:44.910
lt's going to be okay.

29:44.982 --> 29:45.876
lt's okay, baby.

29:45.942 --> 29:47.884
- Yeah.
- l love you.

30:01.688 --> 30:03.215
Where are our clothes?

30:06.041 --> 30:07.351
They're gone.

30:07.418 --> 30:09.141
And our wet suits?

30:09.210 --> 30:11.349
They're gone.

30:11.419 --> 30:14.266
They're fucking with us. Put this on.

30:17.915 --> 30:19.061
Put it on.

30:19.132 --> 30:20.855
This is bad.

30:20.924 --> 30:22.234
You wait here.

30:22.301 --> 30:23.577
Where are you going?

30:23.645 --> 30:25.303
- Just wait.
- No, please.

30:25.373 --> 30:26.748
Bring me along, please.

30:26.813 --> 30:28.537
You just wait. l'll fix it.

30:28.606 --> 30:29.686
- No.
- Wait.

30:29.758 --> 30:31.733
You're all right.

30:42.848 --> 30:45.467
You wake Poppy, you know
what's gonna fucking happen!

30:49.473 --> 30:51.808
We can't seem to find
the pants you guys gave us.

30:53.250 --> 30:55.257
Well, that's a fucking mystery.

30:56.898 --> 30:59.550
Come on. You gonna give us
some pants or what?

30:59.619 --> 31:02.751
Not up to your Volvo
standards, huh, boss?

31:04.355 --> 31:07.651
Listen, my wife's scared.
We're both tired.

31:07.716 --> 31:09.888
Give us a break, will ya?

31:09.957 --> 31:12.129
Give you a break?

31:12.197 --> 31:16.092
You fucking yuppie tort rat.

31:20.999 --> 31:23.301
You fuck up out
in the water, hmm?

31:24.903 --> 31:26.529
You break into our house.

31:29.064 --> 31:31.814
And then you help yourself
to our private fucking property,

31:31.881 --> 31:36.257
and then you bitch and moan
because we ain't got a phone.

31:36.330 --> 31:39.592
You are fucking
unbelievable, sunshine.

31:41.130 --> 31:42.789
So what do you want? Hmm?

31:42.858 --> 31:44.419
Do you want my trousers?

31:46.379 --> 31:49.314
No, no, no, no. 'Cause...

31:49.387 --> 31:52.235
l'm not the one who fucked up.

31:52.300 --> 31:54.439
You fucked up.

31:54.508 --> 31:57.226
You are starting
to give me the shits.

31:57.293 --> 32:00.392
l think you better
wake the old guy up.

32:00.461 --> 32:01.923
l want to speak to him.

32:01.998 --> 32:04.682
Oh, no, no, no. That wouldn't be
a good idea at all.

32:06.799 --> 32:08.392
Then can we have
our wet suits back?

32:08.463 --> 32:11.016
What, those heavy things?

32:11.087 --> 32:12.876
What, do you wanna catch
a cold and give it to us?

32:12.943 --> 32:14.951
(laughs)

32:15.024 --> 32:17.992
No, you see, this is
a working farm, slick.

32:18.065 --> 32:20.236
lt's hard enough
to scratch out a living

32:20.304 --> 32:22.443
without some city
butt-stain coming in here

32:22.513 --> 32:24.969
and treating this place
like his own private shit can.

32:25.042 --> 32:28.588
You are an inconsiderate bastard.

32:30.355 --> 32:31.981
Considering how you
tracked dirt and shit

32:32.051 --> 32:33.644
all the way through
this fucking house.

32:35.188 --> 32:36.268
You've left the tap running outside.

32:36.340 --> 32:38.031
You've wasted half a tank of water.

32:40.757 --> 32:43.146
And you left the lights
on in the back shed.

32:47.797 --> 32:50.383
Now, what's your
old lady like as a cook?

32:59.896 --> 33:02.035
They know about the drugs.

33:02.104 --> 33:04.471
l think we should do
what they say, baby.

33:12.250 --> 33:14.160
(dog grunting)

33:23.164 --> 33:26.613
Jimmy, get her to say somethin'
in froggy talk. Go on.

33:26.685 --> 33:28.790
Darling.

33:30.557 --> 33:31.572
Darling?

33:33.470 --> 33:35.161
Say something in frog talk.

33:35.230 --> 33:37.205
Give me some
of that fucking...

33:37.278 --> 33:40.345
parléz-vous, oui-oui lingo.

33:40.415 --> 33:43.132
(laughs)
Oui-oui lingo.

33:43.199 --> 33:44.694
Fucking...

33:45.856 --> 33:46.805
(Jimmy)
Go on.

33:55.650 --> 33:57.657
(speaking French)

34:10.179 --> 34:12.547
That is fucking sexy.

34:12.612 --> 34:15.197
(laughs)
What'd you say, pussycat?

34:18.565 --> 34:20.321
- lt's a--
- lt's a Gallic folk song.

34:21.414 --> 34:24.349
Mothers sing it to their children.

34:30.312 --> 34:33.378
My cup's empty, captain.

34:40.521 --> 34:42.179
(brothers laugh)

34:42.250 --> 34:43.777
Yeah, a thin dick!

34:46.539 --> 34:49.321
Hey, Volvo,

34:49.386 --> 34:53.380
l want you to show us
your old lady's ass.

34:53.452 --> 34:55.306
Let's see if that's
as good as an Aussie ass.

34:55.371 --> 34:56.866
This has gone far enough.

34:56.940 --> 34:58.151
We just wanna see your old lady's booty.

34:58.221 --> 35:00.588
We did you a favor,
now you do us a fucking favor.

35:00.652 --> 35:02.311
- Quid pro fucking quo!
- Quo! Quo!

35:02.381 --> 35:04.105
Forget it.

35:08.783 --> 35:11.303
What, now you're telling me
what l can and can't do

35:11.374 --> 35:13.317
in my own fucking house, Volvo?

35:16.112 --> 35:18.960
lt's okay. lt's okay. lt's okay.

35:20.913 --> 35:22.091
- No, no, no. No. No.
- (wolf whistle)

35:22.161 --> 35:23.754
lt doesn't matter, Rob. Please.

35:23.825 --> 35:25.735
(wolf whistle)

35:27.185 --> 35:29.706
(Man moaning)

35:29.778 --> 35:32.015
(wolf whistle)

35:32.083 --> 35:33.327
That's enough.

35:33.395 --> 35:36.243
Who the fuck is talking
to you, Volvo, eh?

35:37.747 --> 35:41.904
Now, my drink
is still empty, captain.

35:50.422 --> 35:51.404
What the fuck's this for?

35:51.478 --> 35:53.867
You burned the fucking eggs!

35:53.942 --> 35:56.593
What are we supposed
to do with this shit, eh?

35:56.662 --> 35:59.314
What is this? This your parléz-vous
fucking whore cuisine, is it?

35:59.383 --> 36:01.904
What, you serve that to Volvo, eh?

36:01.975 --> 36:03.186
Well, that's fucking great.

36:04.696 --> 36:06.103
See those?

36:06.168 --> 36:08.111
That's the last of the eggs.

36:08.184 --> 36:10.192
Now what the fuck
are we gonna do for dinner?

36:10.265 --> 36:13.168
Eh? What are we
gonna do for dinner?

36:13.241 --> 36:17.814
'Cause Brett and me,
we're hungry, aren't we, Brett?

36:17.882 --> 36:20.403
l suppose maybe
you could help me, huh?

36:20.475 --> 36:22.809
Uh-huh.

36:22.875 --> 36:24.435
'Cause Brett and me, we're hungry,

36:24.507 --> 36:27.257
and we wanna know what the fuck
you're gonna do about it!

36:38.462 --> 36:40.535
Come on, it's just
a fucking animal. Kill it.

36:40.607 --> 36:42.778
l can't.

36:42.846 --> 36:44.254
lt's just a fucking wallaby.

36:44.319 --> 36:46.774
Thousands of these little fuckers
die on the roads every night.

36:46.847 --> 36:47.741
Come on, cut it!

36:47.807 --> 36:49.564
- l'll cut it, Jim.
- Ah, ah.

36:51.328 --> 36:53.303
What are you, one of these bleeding heart
motherfuckers?

36:53.377 --> 36:54.271
Eh?

36:54.337 --> 36:56.574
Save all the fuzzy fucking creatures.

36:56.641 --> 36:59.937
l just don't kill things.

37:00.002 --> 37:02.653
Oh, oh.

37:02.722 --> 37:05.625
Well-- Well, l guess we could
just stain the little fucker

37:05.699 --> 37:07.706
while he's still alive, eh, Brett?

37:07.779 --> 37:10.398
l mean, how inhumane
is that gonna be, eh?

37:10.468 --> 37:11.995
Fucking kill the fucker!

37:12.068 --> 37:13.628
Leave her alone, will you?

37:13.700 --> 37:17.279
God, you've got some balls,
eh, Volvo?

37:17.348 --> 37:19.585
No! Just leave her alone.

37:19.653 --> 37:21.661
You got some
fucking balls, huh?

37:21.734 --> 37:23.938
Leave her alone, please!

37:24.006 --> 37:27.105
Let's see what your fucking yuppie balls
look like, eh?

37:27.174 --> 37:30.436
Maybe we can fry 'em up
with Scooby there.

37:30.503 --> 37:32.707
Wouldn't be the first time we taste
the old long big, eh, Brett?

37:32.775 --> 37:35.623
- Please.
- Poppy says we shouldn't talk about that.

37:37.288 --> 37:39.044
Maybe we take your
fucking kidneys, eh?

37:39.113 --> 37:40.290
Just cut 'em right out

37:40.360 --> 37:42.750
and we'll feed the scraps
to Honky, eh?

37:42.825 --> 37:44.451
Now you hold real still, slick,

37:44.522 --> 37:47.871
'cause this is gonna hurt
just a little fucking bit.

37:47.946 --> 37:50.281
(whimpering)

37:50.347 --> 37:51.940
(shouts)

37:52.011 --> 37:54.532
Ooh-wee, doggie!

38:00.364 --> 38:02.219
Looks like you're the one

38:02.284 --> 38:04.935
with the balls, darling.

38:07.533 --> 38:09.672
(sobs)
Shh.

38:09.742 --> 38:11.466
lt's all right.

38:11.534 --> 38:13.738
Please.

38:23.888 --> 38:25.896
You--

38:25.969 --> 38:29.003
You ought to be
a fucking chef, oui-oui.

38:29.073 --> 38:31.790
You got a job in the city?

38:31.857 --> 38:34.924
What do you do for crust, eh?

38:34.994 --> 38:36.521

38:36.594 --> 38:38.417
An artist.

38:40.211 --> 38:41.356

38:58.774 --> 39:00.083
And what about you, no-balls?

39:00.150 --> 39:02.769
What do you do when
you're not getting lost

39:02.839 --> 39:04.465
in a little fucking boat?

39:04.535 --> 39:07.153
(Brett scoffs)

39:07.223 --> 39:08.784
l'm a barrister.

39:10.552 --> 39:11.829
What?

39:11.897 --> 39:13.271
A barrister.

39:14.297 --> 39:15.639
''Beeraster?''

39:15.705 --> 39:16.915
(snorts)

39:16.985 --> 39:18.131
You fucking beeraster.

39:18.202 --> 39:20.471
Move to strike
or order a fucking beer!

39:20.538 --> 39:24.401
- (screaming)
- lt's Poppy.

39:28.315 --> 39:29.657
Mmm...

39:49.727 --> 39:52.575
Do you know what we do
for a dollar, darling?

39:54.912 --> 39:56.571
No.

40:00.257 --> 40:02.494
Are you sure?

40:02.561 --> 40:05.562
l have no idea what you do.

40:09.026 --> 40:11.612
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

40:13.764 --> 40:16.666
Listen, my husband and l are tired.

40:16.740 --> 40:18.333
lf there's a place where we can--

40:18.404 --> 40:21.787
Lie down your weary heads, huh?
Go, na-nas?

40:21.860 --> 40:24.643
(French accent)
But, of course, oui-oui.

40:24.709 --> 40:27.263
You must be exhausted!
Huh-huh!

40:31.655 --> 40:34.655
lt's been a big day for you, hasn't it?

40:34.727 --> 40:37.095
Driving that heavy fucking Volvo

40:37.160 --> 40:38.851
all the way out
from the city going boating.

40:38.920 --> 40:40.644
Fishing.

40:40.712 --> 40:42.719
(spits)
Whatever the fuck you were doing.

40:42.792 --> 40:44.483
(snorts)
Well...

40:44.552 --> 40:46.178
(sniffs)

40:46.249 --> 40:49.959
l am sorry that we didn't
set up the suite for you.

40:50.026 --> 40:52.328
But you...

40:52.394 --> 40:54.663
can have the whole barn to yourselves.

40:54.731 --> 40:56.935
How's that?

40:57.003 --> 40:59.392
The barn will be fine, thank you.

40:59.467 --> 41:03.941
(imitating)
The barn will be fine, love.

41:04.012 --> 41:06.151
Jolly good, old cock.

41:22.896 --> 41:24.456
Voila.

41:31.792 --> 41:33.702
Get Honky to guard that fucking door.

41:33.777 --> 41:36.974
(whistles)
Honky!

41:42.643 --> 41:43.821
Honky!

41:43.891 --> 41:47.786
(whistles)

41:47.860 --> 41:49.802
Stupid mutt.

42:09.944 --> 42:11.351
We're getting out of here.

42:11.415 --> 42:13.009
You think they'll just let us run?

42:13.080 --> 42:14.028
What about the dog?

42:14.104 --> 42:15.446
We don't have a choice.

42:15.512 --> 42:17.651
We are not gonna stick around
to see what happens next.

42:17.721 --> 42:20.089
Okay.
Come on.

42:25.146 --> 42:26.488
(Rob)
Come on.

42:35.932 --> 42:37.525
This is too easy.

42:37.596 --> 42:38.905
Go! Move!

42:38.972 --> 42:40.380

- Come on, go!

42:41.885 --> 42:43.227

42:43.294 --> 42:45.465

- Hurry up!

42:45.533 --> 42:47.476
(Rob)
Move it!

42:49.694 --> 42:51.866
Come on!

42:54.047 --> 42:56.252
No. No!

43:08.610 --> 43:11.229
Jesus Christ, they killed him.

43:11.298 --> 43:13.240
They cut him. Fuck.

43:13.315 --> 43:14.809
- Hey!
- (barking)

43:25.860 --> 43:27.322
Get him, Honk.

43:27.397 --> 43:28.346
Go! Get 'em!

43:40.135 --> 43:42.110
You miss me?

43:42.183 --> 43:44.485
Get in the fucking truck!

43:54.890 --> 43:59.844
Skipping out without paying the tariff
is against the law, slick.

44:01.195 --> 44:04.261
Listen, l don't care
if you guys are growing weed.

44:04.331 --> 44:06.437
l mean, l smoke pot.

44:06.508 --> 44:10.305
Unlawful incarceration is a major crime.

44:10.380 --> 44:12.552
You need to think about
what you're doing.

44:12.621 --> 44:15.076
lncarceration.

44:15.149 --> 44:18.085
You fucking lawyer.

44:18.157 --> 44:20.100
You gonna sue us, frog-fucker?

44:21.390 --> 44:23.878
What about that guy out there?

44:23.951 --> 44:25.228
What guy out where?

44:25.295 --> 44:26.473
The guy in the red track suit.

44:26.543 --> 44:28.103
What fucking red track suit, slick?

44:30.736 --> 44:33.257
l can help you.

44:33.328 --> 44:35.816
What's it gonna take?

44:35.889 --> 44:39.021
How much? 100,000?

44:39.089 --> 44:41.905
200,000?

44:41.970 --> 44:44.687
What do you want?

44:44.754 --> 44:47.210
l got what l want.

44:47.283 --> 44:50.000
Come here. Come here!

44:52.692 --> 44:55.180
Now take off your pants
and your shoes.

44:56.532 --> 44:58.835
Now!

44:58.901 --> 45:00.210
(grunts)
Yes.

45:06.263 --> 45:08.172
You want a drink, darlin'?

45:08.246 --> 45:10.035
No, merci.

45:10.103 --> 45:11.314
Oh, Oui, oui, oui, merci.

45:11.383 --> 45:12.430
No, thank you.

45:12.503 --> 45:16.017
Fuckin' said yes,
thank you, now drink!

45:21.561 --> 45:23.350
You fucking--

45:24.473 --> 45:25.422
Rob!

45:25.498 --> 45:26.742
No!

45:32.859 --> 45:34.004
You wanna fuck her?

45:34.075 --> 45:35.253
Yeah.

45:36.699 --> 45:38.587
No, Rob.
(speaks French)

45:40.444 --> 45:42.419
Now, what was that?

45:44.061 --> 45:46.582
She said she's two months pregnant.

45:47.965 --> 45:50.071
She's two months pregnant.

45:50.142 --> 45:53.404
Oh, is that right?
You-- You knocked up?

45:56.511 --> 45:58.267
Yeah.

46:06.145 --> 46:08.033
- Make any difference to you?
- No.

46:09.281 --> 46:10.229
Yeah, well...

46:10.305 --> 46:11.800
Brett here, he ain't fussy.

46:13.506 --> 46:15.416
l don't think he's ever had
a female human before.

46:17.155 --> 46:18.202
Rob!

46:19.843 --> 46:21.053
Aah!

46:21.123 --> 46:23.579
Ohh!

46:31.141 --> 46:33.411
You wanna fuck her now, too?

46:36.646 --> 46:38.239
Yeah.

46:38.310 --> 46:39.936
But you squirt your business in the dirt.

46:40.006 --> 46:42.494
l'm not going sloppy seconds.

46:42.567 --> 46:44.258
(banging)

46:44.327 --> 46:45.789
Shit!

46:55.401 --> 46:57.769
What the fuck's goin' on in here?

46:59.178 --> 47:00.640
Well, Pa, we was, um...

47:02.891 --> 47:05.444
(kicks landing)

47:05.515 --> 47:06.825
(coughing)

47:14.124 --> 47:16.034
What's this?

47:17.133 --> 47:19.555
Um, these two busted into the house.

47:19.629 --> 47:22.629
- That's not true.
- Eh!

47:25.231 --> 47:28.810
What's she doing half naked?

47:28.879 --> 47:31.530
Brett and me, we was--
we was gonna fuck her.

47:31.600 --> 47:34.153
Thought it'd be all right.

47:37.841 --> 47:39.946
Why aren't they tied up?

47:40.017 --> 47:42.985
He's not goin' anywhere, Papa.
l busted his leg.

47:43.058 --> 47:45.065
Look. Have a look.

48:03.381 --> 48:05.553
- Where's Honky?
- Uh, he's--

48:05.621 --> 48:07.410
He found something to roll,
and he's fucking outside somewhere.

48:07.478 --> 48:08.623
He'll be back.

48:09.686 --> 48:10.799
Hey, Pop,

48:10.870 --> 48:13.107
she's a French chick,
ain't she, Jim?

48:13.175 --> 48:16.656
Get her to say something.
Go on, Pop. Go on.

48:24.057 --> 48:27.702
You ain't gonna run off on us,
are ya, baby?

48:27.769 --> 48:29.973
That'd be dangerous.

48:30.042 --> 48:31.765
You see, that dog of ours

48:31.834 --> 48:34.901
kind of has this thing
about new blood.

48:34.971 --> 48:37.360
You haven't got your period
coming, have ya, baby?

48:38.779 --> 48:41.943
Honky'd have a goddamn party
if you were on the rags.

48:43.356 --> 48:45.812
With a dog like that, see,

48:48.125 --> 48:52.468
once he chomps down
and them big jaws lock on...

48:52.542 --> 48:56.187
- (sobbing)
- And right after the job's finished,

48:56.254 --> 48:58.643
you can't pry him off with a crowbar.

48:58.719 --> 49:01.589
(sobbing continues)

49:14.626 --> 49:19.034
l see you didn't lock the shed this avo
like l fucking told ya.

49:19.106 --> 49:22.489
You know how that
complicates things, don't ya?

49:22.563 --> 49:25.760
- Eh, cool dick?
- (whimpering)

49:25.827 --> 49:28.381
(cries out)
Oh, no, please.

49:28.452 --> 49:31.583
- l told him...
- Shut the-- Fucking shut up!

49:38.534 --> 49:42.725
You see, l just been
out to the back shed,

49:42.791 --> 49:45.312
and someone--

49:45.383 --> 49:48.699
maybe an intruder
and his buck-naked missus--

49:48.775 --> 49:51.045
got in there like Goldilocks

49:51.112 --> 49:54.429
and turned the fucking
sprinklers on.

49:54.505 --> 49:58.499
You got any idea what sort
of investment's out there in the shed,

49:58.569 --> 50:01.952
going all moldy
and fucking worthless?

50:02.026 --> 50:04.743
(whimpering)

50:08.139 --> 50:10.561
- (whimpering)
- l'll see you inside, sunshine.

50:10.636 --> 50:12.425
We're gonna have
a little fuckin' talk.

50:12.492 --> 50:14.859
(whimpering continues)

50:18.540 --> 50:19.785
(Jimmy)
l fuckin' told him--

50:19.853 --> 50:22.504
l fuckin' told him, shut the fuckin' door.

50:24.589 --> 50:28.267
We'll work out what we're gonna
do with them in the morning.

50:30.414 --> 50:32.684
Now get me a drink.

50:47.697 --> 50:50.251
Honky'll be back in a minute.

50:50.322 --> 50:52.461
He likes to keep
just outside the door.

50:52.530 --> 50:56.360
You wanna be real careful
going outside.

51:00.148 --> 51:01.359
(lock bangs)

51:06.932 --> 51:08.940
Now what was that for?

51:11.637 --> 51:14.158
(groans)

51:14.230 --> 51:15.605
- Fuck!
- (gasp)

51:19.447 --> 51:20.429
(groans)

51:23.224 --> 51:25.013
(glass shatters)

51:25.080 --> 51:28.626
Let's just forget about all the bud
just gone down the fuckin' toilet.

51:28.697 --> 51:30.934
You know l've got prior convictions.

51:31.001 --> 51:33.238
lf l get picked up for this,
then l'm fucked!

51:33.306 --> 51:35.892
And if l'm fucked,
you're double-fucked!

51:35.962 --> 51:37.042
'Cause you two will starve

51:37.114 --> 51:40.431
like a pair of orphaned
puppies. Wouldn't ya?

51:40.507 --> 51:42.133
- Eh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

51:42.204 --> 51:43.665
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yes, Poppy.

51:43.739 --> 51:46.423
(mimicking)
Oh, oh, y-y-yeah, Poppy.

51:48.892 --> 51:50.681
Have a look at youse.

51:52.060 --> 51:53.490
Me two sons.

51:53.565 --> 51:56.501
Christ Al-fuckin'-mighty.

51:59.487 --> 52:01.756
S-So, what-- what are we
gonna do about it, Pop?

52:06.015 --> 52:07.804
What do you fuckin' reckon?

52:35.332 --> 52:36.543
(groans)

52:39.589 --> 52:41.826
- (cracking)
- (groans)

53:12.970 --> 53:15.011
(whistles)
Honky!

53:17.067 --> 53:18.344
Honky!

53:37.872 --> 53:40.011
(whistles)
Honky!

53:45.041 --> 53:47.278
(whistles)
Honky!

53:47.345 --> 53:49.036
Where the fuck are ya, boy?

53:55.986 --> 53:57.361
(cries out)

53:57.427 --> 54:00.689
Don't move. Don't move, honey.
(groaning)

54:01.907 --> 54:05.137
What happened?

54:05.204 --> 54:06.186
(groans)

54:06.260 --> 54:08.781
They broke your leg.

54:09.813 --> 54:12.083
Did they touch you?

54:12.149 --> 54:14.702
Did they touch you?

54:14.773 --> 54:17.010
No.

54:23.512 --> 54:26.327
- Where are they?
- ln the house.

54:26.392 --> 54:28.781
But they'll be back.
The father's awake.

54:30.073 --> 54:31.633
What are you doing?

54:32.633 --> 54:34.542
Personal security.

54:38.202 --> 54:40.057
What is that?

54:40.122 --> 54:42.032
A surprise.

54:43.195 --> 54:46.195
- Jesus Christ Almighty.
- What?

54:48.124 --> 54:50.579
Are you going to stop them
from putting their dicks inside of me?

54:50.651 --> 54:52.539
Maybe we--

54:52.604 --> 54:55.026
Maybe what? Maybe what?

54:55.100 --> 54:57.719
Maybe the cops
will magically turn up?

54:57.789 --> 54:59.797
Or maybe we should wait
for divine intervention to save us?

54:59.869 --> 55:02.969
So God will strike them dead.
Shall we do that?

55:03.038 --> 55:05.242
How do we stop them without
just making them crazier?

55:05.310 --> 55:06.619
l'm not a fighter. Are you?

55:08.127 --> 55:09.851
We're gonna get out of here.

55:15.392 --> 55:17.215
(thunderclap)

57:10.260 --> 57:12.562
My father said to me once,

57:12.629 --> 57:14.800
''To catch a mad dog,

57:14.869 --> 57:16.812
''you must think like a mad dog...

57:20.470 --> 57:22.380
only madder.''

57:36.312 --> 57:38.484
(instrumental)

57:55.772 --> 57:57.682
(Honky barking)

57:57.756 --> 57:59.415
Honky!

57:59.485 --> 58:01.525
(barking continues)

58:01.597 --> 58:03.986
Go see what that
fuckin' mongrel's up to.

58:04.061 --> 58:07.324
l don't want him fuckin'
with them till l say.

58:07.390 --> 58:09.692
(Brett)
Ah, yeah, Pop.

58:11.263 --> 58:12.605
(Poppy)
You can have the bloke,

58:12.671 --> 58:14.133
but you leave me the sheila.

58:15.391 --> 58:16.636
Right, yeah, Pop.

58:16.704 --> 58:19.071

58:29.217 --> 58:31.836
(Brett)
Honky!

58:59.815 --> 59:01.670
(door closes)

59:15.914 --> 59:19.711
(imitates rifle firing, laughing)

59:23.532 --> 59:26.696
Hey. Hey!

59:26.764 --> 59:28.903
What's wrong with him?

59:30.924 --> 59:32.615
l think he's in shock.

59:32.685 --> 59:35.239
Christ, it's only a busted leg.

59:41.486 --> 59:43.341
Your father hit you because of me?

59:43.406 --> 59:44.934
lt's all right, doll.

59:45.007 --> 59:48.456
We'll call it even
when l pop Volvo here, eh? (chuckling)

59:48.528 --> 59:50.251
You wanna kill him, huh?

59:50.320 --> 59:54.249
You wanna kill him.
l don't believe this.

59:54.320 --> 59:55.979
When l look deep in your eyes,

59:56.049 --> 59:57.805
l can see that you follow your brother.

59:57.873 --> 01:00:00.940
But you're not like him.
You do not even look like him.

01:00:01.010 --> 01:00:03.345
- Well, we got different mothers.
- You see, l'm right.

01:00:03.411 --> 01:00:05.200
You're different than him.

01:00:06.643 --> 01:00:09.993
- Where is your mom now?
- She's gone.

01:00:11.603 --> 01:00:13.426
Poppy says women are only good
for gettin' fucked.

01:00:13.492 --> 01:00:14.954
Then they eventually try and fuck you.

01:00:15.029 --> 01:00:16.785
So l guess he was
finished with her.

01:00:16.853 --> 01:00:21.262
No. No. Poppy's wrong.

01:00:22.325 --> 01:00:24.464
- No. No.
- Poppy's wrong.

01:00:24.534 --> 01:00:27.120
Maybe your mom loves you.
Maybe she wants to be with you.

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:30.933
Shut up! Don't you fucking come in here
telling me what's what!

01:00:30.999 --> 01:00:34.131
You say fucking bye to him now!

01:00:59.644 --> 01:01:02.198

01:01:02.269 --> 01:01:05.401

01:01:22.624 --> 01:01:24.185

(horse whinnies)

01:03:29.878 --> 01:03:32.661
Jimmy, get me a drink.

01:03:32.727 --> 01:03:34.637

01:04:20.767 --> 01:04:22.556
Poppy wants to see you in the house.

01:04:22.623 --> 01:04:24.314
(laughs)

01:04:26.976 --> 01:04:29.016
How you doin' there, slick?

Are ya comfortable? Eh?
(spits)

01:04:34.241 --> 01:04:36.511

01:05:53.391 --> 01:05:54.635
(grunts)

01:06:38.135 --> 01:06:41.071
Poppy likes it if you
make a bit of an effort.

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:44.848
You don't mind, do ya?

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:46.414

01:07:08.988 --> 01:07:12.218

Find him.

01:07:42.498 --> 01:07:44.670
Yeah?

01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:28.358
l had me a missus once.

01:08:30.059 --> 01:08:32.514
A big coon sheila.

01:08:33.738 --> 01:08:35.332
Black velvet.

01:08:38.314 --> 01:08:41.698
This is before Brett's mom
and after Jimmy's.

01:09:06.993 --> 01:09:10.506
She wasn't a classy unit like yourself.

01:09:11.569 --> 01:09:14.569
But she was good
on a real dark night.

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:32.881
(breathing heavily)

01:09:35.350 --> 01:09:36.627
(gasp)

01:09:38.102 --> 01:09:40.207
Pity l had to put her down.

01:09:53.497 --> 01:09:57.589
l opened up her throat
and bled her like a fuckin' pig.

01:09:58.746 --> 01:10:02.227
Hung her out there
in the shed for a month.

01:10:05.691 --> 01:10:07.764
Christ, the stink.

01:10:09.852 --> 01:10:13.049
She smelled bad enough
when she was alive.

01:10:19.005 --> 01:10:22.039
Had to put her
through the mulcher in the end.

01:10:24.127 --> 01:10:26.778
Turned her into fertilizer...

01:10:28.767 --> 01:10:31.288
and dog food.

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.771
Finally found a use for the bitch.

01:10:35.841 --> 01:10:37.816
(laughs)

01:10:47.554 --> 01:10:49.791
You know why l stuck her?

01:10:56.868 --> 01:10:58.778
She didn't follow the rules.

01:10:59.749 --> 01:11:03.045
- (groans)
- Yeah.

01:11:03.109 --> 01:11:04.702
No.

01:11:04.773 --> 01:11:05.918
That's good.

01:11:05.989 --> 01:11:07.932
But, no.

01:11:12.647 --> 01:11:15.463
l guess l just did it

01:11:15.528 --> 01:11:18.627
so she wouldn't have
to suffer like the others.

01:11:18.696 --> 01:11:20.190
Eh?

01:11:22.312 --> 01:11:26.437
We're gonna be gone
around New Year's. Aren't we, eh?

01:11:27.946 --> 01:11:29.888
Hmm. Hmm.
