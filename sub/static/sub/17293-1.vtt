00:00.476 --> 00:02.203
<i>Previously on</i> The Vampire Diaries...

00:02.228 --> 00:04.083
Whatever's inside that vault,

00:04.109 --> 00:06.272
promise me you won't set free.

00:06.274 --> 00:08.540
We need to know exactly
what we're dealing with

00:08.542 --> 00:09.742
so we can fight it.

00:09.744 --> 00:11.610
You can't fight it.

00:11.612 --> 00:12.878
Do I even want to know?

00:12.880 --> 00:14.313
Will it deter you from going in?

00:14.315 --> 00:15.314
Nope.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.548
Then, no, you don't.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.550
- I can help you.
- I need you

00:18.552 --> 00:20.252
to let me go.

00:20.254 --> 00:22.721
Dear Elena, we were so close.

00:22.723 --> 00:25.157
Stefan and I had finally
worked through our problems.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.693
Bonnie and Enzo were on
the verge of being happy.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.441
And then it all changed.

00:29.466 --> 00:30.896
- Damon.
- Elena?

00:30.898 --> 00:33.732
- Where are you?
- Right here.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.587
It only hurts at first.

00:36.612 --> 00:39.613
Then after that, it's kind of fun.

00:41.442 --> 00:44.143
- I'm worried about Bonnie.
- Enzo!

00:44.145 --> 00:46.412
She lost the two people closest to her.

00:46.414 --> 00:48.981
And she can't even do a
locator spell to find them.

00:48.983 --> 00:50.649
Her magic never came back.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.647
It was three
months before we heard

00:52.672 --> 00:53.780
the first rumor.

00:53.805 --> 00:55.988
A string of missing
persons on the West Coast.

00:55.990 --> 00:58.190
But then the numbers kept growing.

00:58.192 --> 00:59.792
It's them. I know it.

00:59.794 --> 01:02.061
Never gets old, does it?

01:02.063 --> 01:03.929
Well, it sure as hell hasn't yet.

01:11.859 --> 01:14.473
Why do you drag me to these
dumb superhero movies?

01:14.475 --> 01:15.654
There's too many.

01:15.679 --> 01:17.276
I can't keep track of who's who.

01:17.278 --> 01:18.724
Their names and their outfits

01:18.749 --> 01:20.713
and who flies and who turns to ice,

01:20.715 --> 01:23.515
who poops fire... it's too much.

01:23.517 --> 01:25.451
Well, that's why you have me.

01:26.754 --> 01:29.555
Okay, well, now we're
on overload. I'm done.

01:29.557 --> 01:31.757
Then I'm done with your
dystopian teen crap movies.

01:31.759 --> 01:33.359
We don't need them either.

01:34.829 --> 01:36.061
Okay, fine,

01:36.063 --> 01:37.896
maybe I'll do one more superhero.

01:37.898 --> 01:40.065
You know, to be honest,

01:40.067 --> 01:41.867
I'm just glad the whole
vampire craze is over.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.202
Ugh.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.410
Watch out!

01:46.974 --> 01:48.841
What the hell?

01:48.843 --> 01:51.364
I almost hit that guy. What's he
doing in the middle of the road?

01:51.388 --> 01:52.687
Look out!

02:07.294 --> 02:08.794
He's dead.

02:08.795 --> 02:10.829
Oh, no... no.

02:13.662 --> 02:15.395
First of all, let me applaud you

02:15.397 --> 02:16.896
on your quick reflexes.

02:16.898 --> 02:19.499
The way you just whipped by me,
it was impressive.

02:23.438 --> 02:24.461
What is this?

02:24.486 --> 02:27.340
This is what is known as a slow night.

02:27.342 --> 02:30.043
I thought we'd go with the
old guy in the road standby,

02:30.045 --> 02:31.773
and you almost got by us.

02:31.798 --> 02:34.781
Yeah, maybe it's time we,
uh, let this one go.

02:36.618 --> 02:38.885
It hurts.

02:44.826 --> 02:46.459
What do you want?

02:46.461 --> 02:48.461
We could use a ride.

02:49.230 --> 02:50.730
It's the least you could do.

02:50.732 --> 02:52.165
Come on.

02:52.167 --> 02:54.567
I'll drive.

02:58.506 --> 03:00.406
Okay, a little backstory

03:00.408 --> 03:02.542
because it's only fair...
My friend here, Enzo, and I

03:02.544 --> 03:04.043
are the unwilling employees...

03:04.045 --> 03:05.678
Not really employees.

03:05.680 --> 03:08.348
Yeah, more like slaves, serfs, lackeys.

03:08.350 --> 03:10.583
- Renfields.
- I hate that reference.

03:10.585 --> 03:12.365
We'll just call it mind control.

03:12.390 --> 03:15.288
Our job is to bring the worst of
humanity, the dregs of life,

03:15.290 --> 03:16.787
and bring them here.

03:16.812 --> 03:21.394
So, between the two of you, who's worse?

03:22.197 --> 03:23.363
Come on.

03:23.365 --> 03:25.098
Winner gets a prize.

03:26.296 --> 03:28.376
What's the worst thing you've
ever done in your life?

03:28.967 --> 03:31.437
I stole makeup from a drugstore once.

03:32.180 --> 03:33.506
Some blush and lipstick.

03:33.508 --> 03:35.208
Try harder.

03:35.210 --> 03:37.143
What's the worst thing

03:37.145 --> 03:39.412
you've ever done in your life?

03:40.515 --> 03:43.375
I slept with my best friend's boyfriend.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.118
That's a little better.

03:45.120 --> 03:46.719
Eight times.

03:47.917 --> 03:50.089
You're doing something wrong, pal.

03:50.091 --> 03:53.559
So, what's the worst
thing you've ever done?

03:53.561 --> 03:56.759
One time, I stole all
my nana's pain pills

03:56.784 --> 03:58.564
and sold them for 50 bucks a pop.

03:59.801 --> 04:01.734
While she was dying of cancer.

04:01.736 --> 04:03.736
I think we have a winner.

04:03.761 --> 04:05.905
What do I win?

04:05.907 --> 04:09.642
You get to die the most painful,
excruciating death imaginable.

04:10.541 --> 04:12.745
- And me?
- We grant you mercy.

04:12.747 --> 04:13.913
You'll die quick.

04:13.915 --> 04:16.115
It'll be over before you...

04:21.022 --> 04:22.889
I'll deal with this one.

04:24.225 --> 04:26.092
You do the honors?

04:26.094 --> 04:27.360
Of course.

04:29.130 --> 04:30.363
This way.

04:30.365 --> 04:31.664
Come on.

04:39.240 --> 04:41.541
No, no, no.

04:41.543 --> 04:42.775
Easy, my friend.

04:42.777 --> 04:45.078
Oh, God, no.

04:45.080 --> 04:46.379
Hey.

04:47.281 --> 04:49.048
Stay calm.

04:49.050 --> 04:52.085
Shh.

04:52.087 --> 04:54.654
No use in making a scene
in your final moments.

04:54.656 --> 04:56.490
I don't want to die.

04:56.515 --> 04:59.903
Yeah, I know. And I don't
particularly want to kill you.

04:59.928 --> 05:02.128
But sometimes we have to do

05:02.130 --> 05:03.996
things we don't like.

05:09.104 --> 05:10.203
What's down there?

05:10.205 --> 05:13.239
Don't really know.

05:13.241 --> 05:14.841
You don't have to do this.

05:14.843 --> 05:15.686
Please.

05:15.711 --> 05:18.411
That's where you're wrong.

05:18.413 --> 05:19.912
I don't have a choice.

05:47.408 --> 05:49.142
Help... help me!

06:02.624 --> 06:05.792
Want to watch some TV?

06:05.794 --> 06:08.494
Nah, I was just gonna
read for a little while.

06:08.496 --> 06:10.696
All right, night then.

06:11.766 --> 06:13.078
Night.

06:26.881 --> 06:28.390
Dear Elena,

06:28.415 --> 06:29.582
for the next week,

06:29.584 --> 06:31.184
you'll be reading updates from me.

06:31.186 --> 06:32.919
Caroline, Stefan and I decided that

06:32.921 --> 06:34.353
only one person should
have to write about

06:34.355 --> 06:36.055
our epic failure at a time.

06:36.057 --> 06:37.557
Believe me, you won't want to

06:37.559 --> 06:39.559
read three versions
of the same sad story

06:39.561 --> 06:41.627
when you wake up.

06:41.629 --> 06:45.431
The search for Damon and
Enzo goes on and on,

06:45.433 --> 06:48.475
and we're no closer to
knowing where they are...

06:48.500 --> 06:51.437
or who, or what, took them.

06:54.209 --> 06:56.275
We promised each
other we'll find ways

06:56.277 --> 06:59.645
to steal small moments
of normal every day.

06:59.647 --> 07:01.814
That's how we'll all stay sane.

07:01.816 --> 07:03.616
But it's just you and
me talking right now,

07:03.618 --> 07:05.918
and I need to tell you:

07:05.920 --> 07:08.154
it's hard.

07:08.156 --> 07:11.858
It's the hardest thing I've
had to do in my whole life.

07:11.860 --> 07:14.126
Darling, your guitar
playing would send Odysseus

07:14.128 --> 07:16.229
sailing in the other direction.

07:16.231 --> 07:19.765
No idea what
that means, but screw you.

07:22.270 --> 07:23.502
Right.

07:23.504 --> 07:25.433
Let me save you from yourself.

07:26.341 --> 07:28.140
I broke it.

07:33.581 --> 07:35.248
Have you really never read The Odyssey?

07:35.250 --> 07:37.683
Is that the one with Helen of Troy?

07:37.685 --> 07:40.019
Not quite.

07:42.624 --> 07:44.190
Thank you.

07:44.192 --> 07:47.827
How can you love such a
terrible guitar player?

07:47.829 --> 07:51.063
Because one day you'll play like a Siren.

07:51.065 --> 07:53.499
And on that day,
I know you'll love me forever.

07:53.501 --> 07:54.834
Why's that?

07:54.836 --> 07:56.402
Only true love

07:56.404 --> 07:59.005
can make you conquer your
absolute lack of skill.

07:59.007 --> 08:01.173
Come here.

08:13.097 --> 08:14.151
And then she cut

08:14.176 --> 08:15.521
their sandwiches into the shapes

08:15.523 --> 08:17.690
of little hearts and stars.

08:17.692 --> 08:19.058
With no crust.

08:19.060 --> 08:20.226
That's cute.

08:20.228 --> 08:22.094
Isn't it?

08:22.096 --> 08:24.862
I'm just saying, if Ric had
hired the old lady nanny,

08:24.887 --> 08:26.866
then my kids wouldn't be
wasting perfectly good parts

08:26.868 --> 08:28.501
of the sandwich.

08:28.503 --> 08:32.605
Millions of people in this
world go hungry every single day

08:32.607 --> 08:33.873
while our hot nanny

08:33.875 --> 08:36.042
is getting all sparkly with their food.

08:36.044 --> 08:39.211
Sounds like you're worried she's
getting "sparkly" with Ric.

08:40.248 --> 08:42.381
Well, yeah.

08:42.383 --> 08:43.683
He's running the Armory

08:43.684 --> 08:45.885
every minute he's away
from Lizzie and Josie.

08:45.887 --> 08:48.020
Sleeping on a futon and
probably not eating

08:48.022 --> 08:49.390
full square meals.

08:49.415 --> 08:52.224
Ooh, maybe...

08:52.226 --> 08:54.727
he's eating the sandwich crusts.

08:55.797 --> 08:57.730
What I mean is,

08:57.732 --> 09:01.233
he's susceptible to hot nanny charms.

09:01.235 --> 09:03.135
We need to look out for him.

09:03.137 --> 09:05.071
You know, he's in a delicate place.

09:05.073 --> 09:08.074
So what's on deck for today?

09:08.076 --> 09:10.543
Well, I'm going back over
all the Central State

09:10.545 --> 09:13.112
Missing Person Reports
for the last four weeks

09:13.114 --> 09:14.880
to see if I missed a pattern.

09:14.882 --> 09:16.182
Great.

09:16.184 --> 09:18.351
I will follow up with
the local affiliates.

09:25.727 --> 09:28.828
Maybe today will be better.

09:28.830 --> 09:30.062
Yeah.

09:34.168 --> 09:35.401
Bye.

09:35.403 --> 09:36.802
Bye.

09:43.211 --> 09:45.111
Stefan, they found a body.

09:45.113 --> 09:46.779
All those people

09:46.781 --> 09:48.848
that we've been tracking,
and now there's a body.

09:48.850 --> 09:51.217
That's good, right?

09:52.949 --> 09:54.129
It's better than yesterday.

09:55.746 --> 09:58.924
Daddy, when can we come to
work and see your toys?

09:58.926 --> 10:00.860
You can come see the
toys when you turn 18.

10:00.862 --> 10:02.895
Will you put Seline on, please?

10:02.897 --> 10:05.097
Okay, you two, go get your swimsuits.

10:09.704 --> 10:12.538
I blew through Caroline's
Monday to-do list.

10:12.540 --> 10:13.939
Anything else you need?

10:13.941 --> 10:15.841
Uh, just one more of you.

10:15.843 --> 10:17.643
Any chance you're a doppelganger?

10:17.645 --> 10:19.345
Should I know what that is?

10:19.347 --> 10:21.614
Not even remotely.

10:21.616 --> 10:24.019
Hey, one of my interns is summoning me.

10:24.044 --> 10:24.871
I have to go.

10:24.896 --> 10:26.115
Make sure no one drowns.

10:26.140 --> 10:27.573
Got it.

10:28.523 --> 10:29.822
You got something?

10:29.824 --> 10:30.956
We got something.

10:30.958 --> 10:32.324
Come on.

10:33.494 --> 10:34.994
Georgie and I have been
playing around in the vault

10:34.996 --> 10:36.162
for a couple weeks now,

10:36.164 --> 10:37.797
trying to figure out how
someone could get out of it

10:37.799 --> 10:39.131
without anyone seeing.

10:39.133 --> 10:40.433
Now, she told me I shouldn't
show you what we found

10:40.435 --> 10:42.438
until you tell us what supernatural thing

10:42.463 --> 10:43.269
escaped from it.

10:43.271 --> 10:45.671
I told you. It's just
a theoretical exercise.

10:45.673 --> 10:47.807
I've been running this place
for only a couple months now,

10:47.809 --> 10:51.161
and I just want to know all
about its nooks and crannies.

10:51.186 --> 10:53.145
Right.

10:54.449 --> 10:55.881
Mother of...

10:55.883 --> 10:57.216
Dorian, uh...

10:57.218 --> 10:58.717
We need to find a better signal.

10:58.719 --> 11:00.601
Or you need to be less jumpy.

11:00.626 --> 11:02.822
So? Did you spill any secrets?

11:02.824 --> 11:04.156
No secrets to spill.

11:04.158 --> 11:05.601
I told you, this is just a...

11:05.626 --> 11:07.660
Theoretical exercise. Yeah, got it.

11:07.662 --> 11:10.262
So, are you ready for us to
theoretically blow your mind?

11:11.165 --> 11:13.199
I think so.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.025
All right, so check it.

11:15.050 --> 11:16.936
Every little crevice in here
leads nowhere, right?

11:16.938 --> 11:19.171
Just walls, dirt and dead-ends.

11:19.173 --> 11:20.573
No one's getting out without a spoon

11:20.575 --> 11:21.740
and a hundred years of digging.

11:21.742 --> 11:23.175
May I?

11:23.177 --> 11:26.312
So, my cousin had this thing

11:26.314 --> 11:28.380
where she lost her hearing
and eyesight real young,

11:28.382 --> 11:29.849
but she became brilliant

11:29.851 --> 11:31.617
at finding her way around,

11:31.619 --> 11:34.820
because all her other
senses were so heightened.

11:34.822 --> 11:36.322
Which got me thinking. Come this way.

11:36.324 --> 11:38.774
- There we go.
- All right,

11:38.799 --> 11:41.571
now you're gonna let your
fingers do the walking.

11:41.596 --> 11:43.195
Go ahead.

11:44.065 --> 11:46.232
Find your way out.

12:12.193 --> 12:14.627
- What is this?
- He's got it.

12:15.897 --> 12:17.196
Yes!

12:17.198 --> 12:18.797
Yes!

12:22.470 --> 12:23.636
Dumped the girl.

12:23.638 --> 12:25.404
Why? She could have been dessert.

12:25.406 --> 12:26.906
You know the rules.

12:26.908 --> 12:28.374
Last night was pushing it.

12:28.376 --> 12:30.109
It wants real evil, not these

12:30.111 --> 12:32.645
lightweight losers we've been feeding it.

12:32.647 --> 12:34.513
Yeah, you should get on that.

12:34.515 --> 12:36.248
I'm trying.

12:36.250 --> 12:37.950
Which is more than you're doing.

12:37.952 --> 12:39.919
Hey, this is a really good book.

12:41.722 --> 12:45.157
How long is this bad-guy
slaughter going to last?

12:45.159 --> 12:48.327
How many more bodies will
it take before this is over?

12:48.329 --> 12:50.229
It can hear you.

12:50.231 --> 12:52.498
It can get into our minds.
It knows how I feel.

12:52.500 --> 12:55.935
Well, there's no reason to go
out of your way to aggravate it.

12:58.839 --> 13:01.307
Do you have any control left?

13:01.309 --> 13:03.342
Me, I'm down to about...

13:03.344 --> 13:04.843
I don't know, two percent.

13:04.845 --> 13:07.613
No free will needed.
I have flipped my switch.

13:07.615 --> 13:08.622
Humanity off.

13:08.647 --> 13:10.816
I'm on full cruise control.

13:10.818 --> 13:12.184
I recommend it.

13:12.186 --> 13:14.567
Oh, so you really have
nothing left inside?

13:14.592 --> 13:16.455
Just my winning sense of humor

13:16.457 --> 13:18.824
and a renewed appreciation for chick-lit.

13:20.528 --> 13:22.595
I'm sorry, did we wake you?

13:22.597 --> 13:25.164
When does this end?!

13:25.166 --> 13:27.112
How many more bodies till you're full?

13:27.137 --> 13:29.001
Yelling never gets you anything.

13:29.003 --> 13:30.402
Try asking nicely.

13:52.126 --> 13:54.026
Get an answer?

14:00.911 --> 14:03.154
Look, I know it's
not much, but it's a lead.

14:03.179 --> 14:04.686
I mean, all those missing
people along the trail

14:04.710 --> 14:06.148
we've been following,
and this is the first time

14:06.150 --> 14:07.149
a body has surfaced.

14:07.151 --> 14:08.617
Probably because it has nothing to do

14:08.619 --> 14:09.974
with what we're looking for.

14:09.999 --> 14:11.816
Yeah, well, I can't let
myself think like that.

14:11.840 --> 14:13.122
I have to treat every single clue

14:13.124 --> 14:14.657
like it's the one that's
gonna lead us to them.

14:14.659 --> 14:16.892
Stefan...

14:17.428 --> 14:21.305
every time we do this,
I let myself hope a little.

14:21.330 --> 14:22.610
And when we end up

14:22.635 --> 14:25.445
back at zero, my heart
crushes in on itself

14:25.470 --> 14:26.746
a little bit more.

14:26.771 --> 14:29.305
I don't know how much my
heart has left, you know?

14:30.599 --> 14:32.566
Bonnie...

14:32.568 --> 14:35.369
no one... Not Caroline, not Elena...

14:35.371 --> 14:38.872
No one knows how to
fight longer or harder

14:38.874 --> 14:40.207
or better than you.

14:40.209 --> 14:41.908
If you give up,

14:41.910 --> 14:44.044
I won't have anything left to hold on to.

14:45.868 --> 14:47.367
Please don't give up.

14:51.019 --> 14:52.986
Of course.

14:52.988 --> 14:55.222
But...

14:55.224 --> 14:57.691
don't ask me to have hope.

14:57.693 --> 14:59.326
Hope hurts.

14:59.328 --> 15:01.501
I don't want to hurt anymore.

15:17.479 --> 15:19.446
I can't believe you guys found this.

15:19.448 --> 15:20.747
It's an optical illusion.

15:20.749 --> 15:22.449
You can't see or hear your way out.

15:22.451 --> 15:25.018
Your sense of touch has
to be completely isolated.

15:25.020 --> 15:26.386
Bananas, right?

15:28.457 --> 15:29.689
So where's the tunnel go?

15:29.691 --> 15:30.991
We don't know yet.

15:30.993 --> 15:32.492
That's why you're here.

15:34.997 --> 15:37.697
Unless you're, like...

15:37.699 --> 15:39.533
claustrophobic or something.

15:40.300 --> 15:43.370
No. No.

15:43.372 --> 15:45.205
Let's just start walking.

15:53.248 --> 15:55.215
Hey.

15:55.217 --> 15:56.416
Hi.

15:58.341 --> 16:00.587
- Hi, girls.
- Mommy!

16:00.589 --> 16:01.788
Hi.

16:01.790 --> 16:02.956
Sorry we're early.

16:02.958 --> 16:04.691
Oh, it's okay.

16:04.693 --> 16:07.794
Oh, some guy named Pete from sound

16:07.796 --> 16:10.030
dropped this off for
you a few minutes ago.

16:10.032 --> 16:11.675
- Thank you.
- No problem.

16:11.700 --> 16:14.134
You guys all good while I go grab a salad?

16:14.136 --> 16:17.404
Yep. Enjoy your salad.

16:17.406 --> 16:19.940
Bye.

16:20.654 --> 16:22.677
She probably likes kale, too.

16:22.702 --> 16:24.444
What's kale?

16:25.380 --> 16:27.647
You don't want to know.

16:27.649 --> 16:29.638
What movie is that, Mommy?

16:29.663 --> 16:32.285
This is a work movie

16:32.287 --> 16:33.720
that Mommy's been waiting for.

16:33.722 --> 16:36.156
The sound was broken,
so Pete had to fix it.

16:36.158 --> 16:37.324
All right, that is

16:37.326 --> 16:38.892
Aunt Bonnie's friend Enzo.

16:38.894 --> 16:41.261
This is a movie about him
trying to learn about...

16:41.263 --> 16:43.430
a magical creature.

16:43.455 --> 16:44.414
And that is

16:44.439 --> 16:46.700
Princess Virginia St. John,

16:46.702 --> 16:48.535
who used to be locked in a tower.

16:48.537 --> 16:52.138
And she's the only one
in the whole kingdom

16:52.140 --> 16:55.141
who knows the secrets of the
creature we're looking for.

16:55.143 --> 16:57.591
But the princess escaped, and now

16:57.616 --> 16:59.913
no one can find her.

17:00.549 --> 17:04.416
Now, tell me what it is.

17:06.154 --> 17:07.521
Too loud.

17:07.522 --> 17:09.055
Oh, yeah, sorry.

17:09.057 --> 17:10.679
The movie's boring, Mommy.

17:10.704 --> 17:12.469
Well, it's not boring.

17:12.493 --> 17:13.993
It's just...

17:13.996 --> 17:15.647
broken.

17:15.673 --> 17:17.319
What was that back there?

17:17.345 --> 17:20.333
I've never seen an archeologist
afraid to explore a tunnel.

17:20.335 --> 17:21.867
I am not an archeologist.

17:21.869 --> 17:23.002
Come on.

17:23.005 --> 17:24.405
You're practically Indiana Jones.

17:24.430 --> 17:26.506
Yeah, that's the former me.

17:26.508 --> 17:27.973
Before I had two daughters

17:27.976 --> 17:30.710
who expect me to come home in one piece.

17:30.712 --> 17:34.014
Ah, the new me is an academic geek only.

17:34.016 --> 17:35.348
Dad me.

17:35.350 --> 17:37.974
I like to avoid dangerous situations.

17:37.999 --> 17:40.620
Plus, you know, you've been
doing this as long as I have,

17:40.622 --> 17:45.358
you learn that rarely is a
secret tunnel just a tunnel.

17:48.363 --> 17:50.630
Okay, watch your step.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.652
Case in point.

18:20.913 --> 18:22.312
Whoa.

18:24.228 --> 18:25.560
What is this?

18:27.527 --> 18:29.360
Looks like a geek gold mine.

18:34.710 --> 18:36.242
Excuse me.

18:36.244 --> 18:38.144
Oh, come on.

18:38.146 --> 18:39.999
It took me four hours

18:40.024 --> 18:42.449
to get control of the scene
from the local idiots.

18:42.451 --> 18:44.226
Now they're letting press past the tape?

18:44.251 --> 18:45.317
We're not press.

18:45.954 --> 18:47.587
We're not anyone.

18:47.589 --> 18:49.723
But tell us what you know.

18:51.293 --> 18:54.561
Female victim, strangled,
then exsanguinated,

18:54.563 --> 18:56.663
or maybe vice versa.

18:56.665 --> 18:58.832
Brace yourselves, it ain't pretty.

18:58.834 --> 19:02.135
We found blood on the grille,
not matching her type.

19:02.137 --> 19:05.005
Blood in the road over there,
also not her type.

19:06.008 --> 19:07.461
Her car is dented,

19:07.486 --> 19:09.909
like she hit a deer,
maybe a mountain lion.

19:10.979 --> 19:12.344
Or a person.

19:12.369 --> 19:13.847
Teeth marks above the collarbone,

19:13.849 --> 19:15.415
ligatures on her neck

19:15.417 --> 19:16.950
from the wire.

19:20.188 --> 19:22.122
That's not wire.

19:24.421 --> 19:26.287
It's guitar string.

19:30.966 --> 19:33.767
It's just a lot of empty land.

19:33.769 --> 19:35.035
Farms.

19:35.037 --> 19:37.971
The gas odometer only
had three miles on it.

19:37.973 --> 19:38.905
That's strange.

19:38.907 --> 19:40.306
Maybe that means something?

19:40.308 --> 19:42.008
There was a news story about this area

19:42.010 --> 19:43.243
a couple months ago.

19:43.245 --> 19:45.022
Some locals cried miracle

19:45.047 --> 19:47.113
when a nearby creek ran red with blood.

19:47.115 --> 19:48.100
Turns out

19:48.125 --> 19:50.750
there's a slaughterhouse
with a drainage issue nearby.

19:50.752 --> 19:52.585
They closed it down.

19:52.587 --> 19:54.487
How far from the crime scene?

19:55.190 --> 19:57.357
Exactly three miles.

19:58.460 --> 20:00.493
I'll go check it out. I'll call you back.

20:04.099 --> 20:06.905
Tell me what it is.

20:06.930 --> 20:09.346
Ugh, God.

20:11.239 --> 20:14.107
Hey, I'm walking out the door right now.

20:14.109 --> 20:16.342
Oh, no, no rush. You're not late yet.

20:16.344 --> 20:18.144
But have you heard from Alaric?

20:18.146 --> 20:20.513
His phone's been going straight
to voice mail all afternoon.

20:20.515 --> 20:22.682
I haven't, but I can try his office.

20:22.684 --> 20:23.650
Hold on.

20:23.652 --> 20:25.051
Is everything okay?

20:25.053 --> 20:27.253
Oh, yeah, fine.

20:27.255 --> 20:28.755
The girls are playing hide and seek,

20:28.757 --> 20:31.157
only where they both
hide and no one seeks.

20:31.159 --> 20:33.293
Yeah, check their
closet. It's their go-to.

20:33.295 --> 20:35.241
This is Brody.

20:35.266 --> 20:36.807
Hey, Brody, it's Caroline.

20:36.832 --> 20:38.431
I'm looking for Ric, is he around?

20:38.433 --> 20:40.700
Oh, wait. Here he is.

20:40.702 --> 20:42.936
Okay, thanks, just...

20:42.961 --> 20:44.309
Can you have him call
me when he gets out?

20:44.333 --> 20:45.905
- Okay, I will.
- Okay, bye.

20:46.975 --> 20:48.230
Yeah, Seline, he's okay.

20:48.255 --> 20:50.343
He's just geeking out on the job.

20:50.345 --> 20:52.178
That's weird.

20:52.180 --> 20:54.414
You don't think the girls
would leave the house, do you?

20:54.416 --> 20:55.915
Why? What's wrong?

21:00.355 --> 21:03.356
The front door just blew open.

21:03.358 --> 21:06.559
I thought it was Ric, but...

21:06.561 --> 21:09.062
Caroline...

21:09.064 --> 21:10.697
someone's in the house.

21:10.722 --> 21:12.055
Seline?

22:00.467 --> 22:01.833
Hi, Mommy.

22:01.835 --> 22:04.035
Hi, babies.

22:04.037 --> 22:06.338
Don't move, okay?

22:06.340 --> 22:08.273
Stay here.

22:23.123 --> 22:24.456
Come on.

22:24.458 --> 22:26.491
Come on!

22:28.662 --> 22:30.996
Good.

22:38.205 --> 22:41.106
Dorian's bringing more work lights.

22:41.108 --> 22:43.041
This room is wild.

22:43.043 --> 22:44.609
I mean, anything subterranean should have

22:44.611 --> 22:45.844
evidence of erosion.

22:45.846 --> 22:47.979
The moisture from the earth alone

22:47.981 --> 22:49.180
should have eaten through
most of these artifacts,

22:49.182 --> 22:51.650
but everything is perfectly preserved.

22:51.652 --> 22:52.617
Yeah.

22:52.619 --> 22:55.053
Just like in the pyramids.

22:55.055 --> 22:56.621
Oh, boy.

22:56.623 --> 22:58.657
Except for that guy.

22:58.659 --> 22:59.958
Whoever he was.

23:01.361 --> 23:03.628
I wouldn't touch that.

23:03.630 --> 23:05.730
Let's just leave everything alone.

23:05.732 --> 23:07.132
I mean, if everything
has been undisturbed

23:07.134 --> 23:08.700
for as long as I think it has,

23:08.702 --> 23:10.802
I'd hate to expose these artifacts

23:10.804 --> 23:12.170
until we seal the space.

23:12.172 --> 23:15.407
Your geek brain makes you super hot.

23:15.409 --> 23:16.741
You know that?

23:18.211 --> 23:20.979
Uh, Georgie...

23:20.981 --> 23:22.847
don't think that I don't appreciate it,

23:22.849 --> 23:24.749
but I'm pretty much

23:24.751 --> 23:26.384
closed for business.

23:26.386 --> 23:28.486
You know, it's just me and my kids

23:28.488 --> 23:30.922
and no distractions.

23:30.924 --> 23:33.158
Dad you.

23:33.160 --> 23:36.094
Yeah, yeah. Exactly.

23:40.534 --> 23:43.668
Well, that's a shame. I had to try.

23:43.670 --> 23:44.991
Sexy dark tunnel,

23:45.016 --> 23:47.272
magical room, et cetera.

23:48.141 --> 23:50.642
Professor S, Caroline's been calling.

23:50.644 --> 23:52.177
Says it's an emergency.

23:59.453 --> 24:01.753
I just walked in.

24:01.755 --> 24:03.794
They're still processing the scene.

24:03.819 --> 24:05.919
It shouldn't be much longer.

24:07.628 --> 24:09.794
What is that?

24:11.716 --> 24:13.883
Looks like candle wax.

24:17.371 --> 24:19.237
Everything okay?

24:19.239 --> 24:22.440
I'm on my way.

24:39.526 --> 24:41.059
Damon.

24:49.603 --> 24:51.736
Stefan.

24:53.206 --> 24:55.974
Hello, brother.

25:06.219 --> 25:08.142
What is all this?

25:09.462 --> 25:11.341
What are you doing?

25:11.343 --> 25:13.242
Daily chores.

25:14.546 --> 25:16.979
What was in that vault, Damon?

25:16.981 --> 25:18.448
What has ahold of you?

25:18.450 --> 25:21.084
Eh, it doesn't matter what has me.

25:21.086 --> 25:22.752
Only that I've been had.

25:22.754 --> 25:25.574
You should be proud of me.

25:25.599 --> 25:27.690
Killing bad people.

25:27.692 --> 25:28.825
Where's Enzo?

25:31.096 --> 25:32.562
Go home, Stefan.

25:32.564 --> 25:34.230
We're all good here.

25:34.232 --> 25:36.499
In a slaughterhouse?

25:36.501 --> 25:38.101
Surrounded by death.

25:38.103 --> 25:40.203
It's who we are, brother.

25:40.205 --> 25:43.272
It's who we've been for 160-some years.

25:43.297 --> 25:46.759
I know you think it's
still worth the fight

25:46.784 --> 25:49.049
to live the illusion of your heroic life,

25:49.074 --> 25:51.047
but I'm officially done.

25:51.049 --> 25:53.282
You flipped your switch, didn't you?

25:53.284 --> 25:55.063
Always the quick one.

25:55.088 --> 25:56.721
I can help you get your humanity back.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.823
I know you can, and I don't want it.

25:58.825 --> 26:01.526
I've seen how this ends, and believe me,

26:01.551 --> 26:03.201
humanity can't

26:03.226 --> 26:04.963
save me from it.

26:04.965 --> 26:06.364
What are you talking about?

26:06.366 --> 26:08.667
I'm talking about hell, brother.

26:08.669 --> 26:10.635
Not the kind of hell

26:10.637 --> 26:12.871
that traps you in a stone.

26:12.873 --> 26:15.507
Fire and brimstone hell.

26:16.777 --> 26:18.910
I've seen it.

26:18.912 --> 26:21.446
I met it up close.

26:21.448 --> 26:24.149
Tasted it, touched it.

26:26.053 --> 26:27.953
It's beyond its reputation.

26:27.955 --> 26:31.022
You're not making any sense.

26:32.693 --> 26:34.960
Okay.

26:36.830 --> 26:39.898
You need to go. It doesn't want you yet.

26:39.900 --> 26:42.200
Walk out of here with
your hero hair intact,

26:42.202 --> 26:44.135
and never come back.

26:45.585 --> 26:47.718
Not without you.

26:47.720 --> 26:50.755
Okay, so obviously this is
a little bit awkward,

26:50.757 --> 26:52.557
but after a good night's sleep,

26:52.559 --> 26:54.492
you should wake up none
the wiser.

26:54.494 --> 26:56.427
The girls are in the car.

26:56.429 --> 26:58.396
After dinner, take them for ice cream.

26:58.398 --> 26:59.931
Be gone at least two hours.

26:59.933 --> 27:00.998
Got it?

27:01.000 --> 27:03.201
We'll get some hot fudge sundaes.

27:03.203 --> 27:05.232
Yeah.

27:05.257 --> 27:06.957
Okay.

27:18.985 --> 27:20.585
Wake up!

27:24.624 --> 27:27.725
I said wake up.

27:29.395 --> 27:32.597
You have 30 seconds to explain
why you came after my kids.

27:32.599 --> 27:35.633
And then 30 more seconds
to answer a few questions

27:35.635 --> 27:37.902
about that stupid vault.

27:37.904 --> 27:39.070
Go.

27:39.072 --> 27:41.939
You let them open the vault.

27:41.941 --> 27:45.843
I told you not to open it.

27:45.845 --> 27:47.612
Yeah, well, joke's on us.

27:47.614 --> 27:49.280
15 seconds.

27:49.282 --> 27:52.450
It has come for them.

27:54.020 --> 27:55.987
No, no, we are not playing this game.

27:55.989 --> 27:57.388
What is it?!

27:57.390 --> 28:00.258
What does it want with my children?!

28:02.228 --> 28:04.128
What?

28:05.265 --> 28:06.430
Oh, my God.

28:06.432 --> 28:08.432
That's your tongue.

28:17.110 --> 28:20.111
Don't do anything
you might regret.

28:20.113 --> 28:21.320
Think about Elena.

28:21.345 --> 28:22.980
I'm trying to explain to you, Stefan,

28:22.982 --> 28:24.382
Elena doesn't matter to me anymore.

28:24.384 --> 28:25.449
Why?

28:25.451 --> 28:27.051
Because you flipped your switch?

28:27.053 --> 28:28.753
I ripped the switch off the wall.

28:28.755 --> 28:32.156
There is no switch, Stefan,
because there is no hope.

28:32.158 --> 28:34.392
Every drop of blood I ever spilled,

28:34.394 --> 28:35.626
every body I've ever drained,

28:35.628 --> 28:39.730
every bad decision I've
ever made sealed my fate.

28:39.732 --> 28:43.000
My path and Elena's path,
they're not the same.

28:43.002 --> 28:47.498
Her great beyond is a decidedly
happier one than mine.

28:48.918 --> 28:51.318
Now for the last time, go.

28:58.885 --> 29:01.285
I said no.

29:02.422 --> 29:04.889
Get him in the car while I find Enzo.

29:04.891 --> 29:06.223
We have to leave. It's not safe.

29:06.225 --> 29:08.025
We're not leaving without Enzo.

29:24.094 --> 29:26.602
You need to leave now, Stefan,
before Damon is forced

29:26.627 --> 29:28.319
to do something no one is going to like.

29:28.321 --> 29:30.521
Let me go, Damon!

29:32.425 --> 29:33.825
Go.

29:37.440 --> 29:38.972
Fine.

29:39.833 --> 29:41.833
Let her go, and we'll be on our way.

29:44.641 --> 29:47.171
Till we meet again, Bon.

29:55.181 --> 29:56.981
Enzo.

29:58.943 --> 30:01.532
Don't you two get it?

30:01.534 --> 30:04.502
You think you can win against this thing?

30:04.504 --> 30:05.903
You can't.

30:05.905 --> 30:07.304
My life is over.

30:07.306 --> 30:08.939
My life has been over

30:08.941 --> 30:11.008
for a century and a half, Stefan.

30:12.792 --> 30:15.426
Since you took it from me.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.522
Let's get out of here.

30:28.594 --> 30:30.327
I tried to heal her, but she just kept

30:30.329 --> 30:33.030
bleeding out until she was dead.

30:33.032 --> 30:35.842
I couldn't even get any
information out of her.

30:35.867 --> 30:36.567
One tunnel.

30:36.569 --> 30:38.469
I decide to go down one simple tunnel,

30:38.471 --> 30:39.970
and instead of being
available for my kids

30:39.972 --> 30:41.805
who are under attack, I'm out of range.

30:41.830 --> 30:43.313
I mean, are we doing this all wrong?

30:43.338 --> 30:46.079
Should we just never leave their
sides for the rest of their lives?

30:46.104 --> 30:47.211
I don't know.

30:47.213 --> 30:49.313
We don't know how to do it right,
clearly, or someone

30:49.315 --> 30:51.782
wouldn't have tried to
assassinate our nanny tonight.

30:51.784 --> 30:54.025
It's because we're divided.

30:54.050 --> 30:57.221
I live 30 minutes away
in a crappy apartment.

30:57.223 --> 30:59.017
We share custody.

30:59.042 --> 31:00.645
I'm just too far away to help you out.

31:00.670 --> 31:02.914
You want to move back into town?

31:02.916 --> 31:04.982
No, I want to move in here.

31:07.020 --> 31:09.887
Ric...

31:09.889 --> 31:12.390
I want us to be a family and a team,

31:12.392 --> 31:15.426
yes, but, we can't live together.

31:16.596 --> 31:19.230
Okay, I didn't say I
thought you should stay.

31:19.232 --> 31:21.265
That's crazy.

31:22.268 --> 31:23.968
This is my childhood home!

31:23.970 --> 31:25.670
Where am I supposed to go?

31:25.672 --> 31:28.339
You know exactly where you should go.

31:28.341 --> 31:29.874
And you've wanted to be
there for months now,

31:29.876 --> 31:31.509
but out of respect for my feelings,

31:31.511 --> 31:33.511
- you haven't done it yet.
- Ric...

31:33.513 --> 31:34.512
Caroline,

31:34.514 --> 31:36.514
I want you to be happy.

31:36.516 --> 31:38.316
Okay, I want our girls to be happy.

31:38.318 --> 31:41.085
And one of these days,
I plan on being happy, too.

31:41.087 --> 31:42.787
Look...

31:42.789 --> 31:45.857
we can't escape this life, Care.

31:45.859 --> 31:49.594
So shouldn't we make sure
we're at least living it right?

32:03.076 --> 32:05.810
You haven't said a word.

32:06.913 --> 32:09.347
I know that was hard.

32:09.349 --> 32:11.482
But that wasn't Enzo.

32:13.353 --> 32:16.487
That wasn't Damon.
They're not in control.

32:16.489 --> 32:19.524
But all those clues...

32:19.526 --> 32:21.993
The guitar string and the odometer...

32:24.164 --> 32:27.165
...Enzo left them for me.

32:27.167 --> 32:28.282
I know it.

32:30.703 --> 32:33.070
He wanted us to find them.

32:33.072 --> 32:35.907
Next time, we'll get them
back from whatever it is

32:35.909 --> 32:37.469
that has ahold of them.

32:39.512 --> 32:42.813
Not 12 hours ago, you were telling me...

32:42.815 --> 32:45.416
have hope.

32:47.253 --> 32:49.387
You were right.

32:49.389 --> 32:51.923
He said it was my fault.

32:53.860 --> 32:58.129
He's said it before, so I don't
know why it hurt so much.

32:58.131 --> 33:00.331
This time, it feels like...

33:01.901 --> 33:04.068
...he may never forgive me.

33:10.510 --> 33:12.843
Maybe you were right, this morning.

33:12.845 --> 33:14.212
No.

33:14.214 --> 33:16.647
No, you were right.

33:16.649 --> 33:19.450
You told me there was hope.

33:20.787 --> 33:23.821
Now, just take a minute,

33:23.823 --> 33:26.557
pull yourself together and go find yours.

33:49.072 --> 33:51.373
You really never read The Odyssey?

33:51.375 --> 33:54.175
Is that the one
with Helen of Troy?

33:55.245 --> 33:57.779
"In the meantime, our good ship,

33:57.781 --> 34:00.181
with that friendly breeze to drive her,

34:00.183 --> 34:02.784
fast approached the Sirens' isle."

34:02.786 --> 34:04.953
Oh. I think I remember this.

34:04.955 --> 34:08.523
The Sirens lured the sailors
into shore with their song

34:08.525 --> 34:09.791
before they ate them.

34:09.793 --> 34:11.893
More importantly, this book is one of

34:11.895 --> 34:14.062
the greatest love stories of all time.

34:14.063 --> 34:17.532
You're an incurable romantic, aren't you?

34:17.534 --> 34:22.637
When it comes to you, love,
I would never stop fighting.

34:22.639 --> 34:25.774
I would brave the oceans
and sail past the Sirens

34:25.775 --> 34:27.842
to find my way back to you.

34:37.757 --> 34:40.789
"Meanwhile,
I took a large round of wax,

34:40.791 --> 34:43.491
cut it up small with my sharp sword,

34:43.493 --> 34:47.629
I took all my men in turn and
plugged their ears with it."

34:49.259 --> 34:52.230
_

34:53.637 --> 34:55.704
"Then they bound me hand and foot,

34:55.706 --> 34:58.139
standing me up by the
step of the ship's mast

34:58.141 --> 35:01.042
and then lashing me
to the mast itself."

35:10.120 --> 35:12.721
I am a fan of the
homegrown art community.

35:12.723 --> 35:15.156
You know, the wine is dreadful,

35:15.158 --> 35:16.558
but the people are nice.

35:16.560 --> 35:18.627
You know, I couldn't help
but notice in your work

35:18.629 --> 35:20.696
that you express a certain...

35:20.721 --> 35:22.564
inner struggle.

35:22.566 --> 35:24.599
Darkness and light.

35:24.601 --> 35:26.337
A burdened brain,

35:26.359 --> 35:27.330
if you will.

35:27.355 --> 35:30.073
You really enjoy exploring themes

35:30.098 --> 35:32.307
of sin and redemption.

35:32.309 --> 35:34.843
Hmm. You're very astute.

35:34.845 --> 35:37.278
Not many people in these parts get it.

35:37.280 --> 35:38.580
True.

35:38.582 --> 35:40.215
But you should know

35:40.217 --> 35:43.318
that there is no such
thing as redemption.

35:43.320 --> 35:45.220
Because it only takes one bad day,

35:45.222 --> 35:48.423
one bad decision, and then
it doesn't matter what you do

35:48.425 --> 35:50.428
with the rest of your life,

35:50.453 --> 35:52.494
because once the devil comes a-calling...

35:53.930 --> 35:55.664
...you're done.

35:55.666 --> 35:57.999
Amazing use of red, by the way.

35:58.001 --> 36:00.335
Not every victim needs a monologue.

36:00.337 --> 36:02.048
Well, we don't know
that he's our guy yet.

36:02.073 --> 36:03.438
It might be a misunderstanding.

36:03.440 --> 36:04.773
See, here's the thing.

36:04.775 --> 36:07.275
My friend here and I have
a particularly innate

36:07.277 --> 36:09.310
sense of smell, not to mention

36:09.312 --> 36:10.979
an immense appreciation for blood,

36:10.981 --> 36:12.480
and we just couldn't help but notice

36:12.482 --> 36:14.416
that the red that you use,

36:14.418 --> 36:17.852
very liberally, I might add...
Maybe a bit too on the nose...

36:17.854 --> 36:20.691
Has a very familiar scent.

36:22.526 --> 36:25.226
Care to explain to my friend and I

36:25.228 --> 36:28.129
why you are indeed
painting with human blood?

36:28.131 --> 36:30.265
And more importantly,

36:30.267 --> 36:33.334
what the hell did you do to
the person you got it from?

36:33.336 --> 36:35.270
Go ahead.

36:35.272 --> 36:37.138
Whisper in his ear.

36:46.263 --> 36:49.350
What is it with Middle America and evil?

36:50.787 --> 36:52.053
Stay with us.

36:52.055 --> 36:54.689
Don't say anything.

36:55.559 --> 36:57.459
Enzo.

36:57.461 --> 36:59.728
Little surprised by our
family visit tonight.

36:59.730 --> 37:02.330
I thought you said we
were covering our tracks.

37:02.332 --> 37:03.865
We are.

37:03.867 --> 37:05.730
Well, then how the hell
did they they find us?

37:05.755 --> 37:07.635
Beats me, mate. You saw for yourself,

37:07.637 --> 37:09.504
it wants me in line, I'm in line.

37:09.506 --> 37:11.139
It can get in your head.

37:11.141 --> 37:14.209
And if it knows who you care about,

37:14.211 --> 37:15.777
or who you're trying to get back to,

37:15.779 --> 37:17.746
well, you know what can happen.

37:17.748 --> 37:19.881
You may want to consider
flipping your switch,

37:19.883 --> 37:24.085
because if you care for nothing,
it can see nothing.

37:26.757 --> 37:28.923
Come on, boy.

37:34.431 --> 37:36.998
Dear Elena,

37:37.000 --> 37:40.902
it's not my turn, but I
wanted you to hear it from me.

37:40.904 --> 37:43.371
I think I've lost him.

37:43.373 --> 37:45.573
All I can do is hope

37:45.575 --> 37:48.510
that there is one small
piece of his mind

37:48.512 --> 37:50.945
tucked away someplace safe.

37:50.947 --> 37:54.482
One final sliver of humanity
holding on for dear life,

37:54.484 --> 37:56.384
buried deep inside.

37:59.890 --> 38:02.223
I know, Bonnie. You're right.

38:02.225 --> 38:03.725
You and my mom both are.

38:03.727 --> 38:06.227
I just can't bring myself to tell him.

38:06.229 --> 38:08.663
At least not tonight.

38:08.665 --> 38:10.565
I'll call you later.

38:13.252 --> 38:14.736
Katherine.

38:15.883 --> 38:17.906
Um... no. I...

38:20.944 --> 38:22.110
I'm Elena.

38:22.112 --> 38:24.345
Elena.

38:26.416 --> 38:28.283
I need you.

38:29.452 --> 38:31.419
I don't know how much longer I can fight.

38:37.307 --> 38:40.061
I won't give up on him.

38:40.063 --> 38:43.231
But it's hard to hold on to hope.

38:43.233 --> 38:44.966
Hope hurts.

38:46.837 --> 38:50.004
Maybe tomorrow will be better.

38:51.474 --> 38:52.807
Hey.

38:52.809 --> 38:54.976
Hey.

38:55.851 --> 38:58.179
Bad day?

39:05.606 --> 39:07.739
So, I've been thinking.

39:09.759 --> 39:12.794
You alone in this big house.

39:12.796 --> 39:16.231
I wonder if maybe...

39:16.256 --> 39:18.633
you'd like someone else to fill it.

39:21.705 --> 39:24.138
That someone would be me, by the way.

39:25.675 --> 39:27.475
Living here.

39:27.477 --> 39:29.043
With you.

39:29.045 --> 39:32.080
I mean, uh...

39:32.082 --> 39:34.649
I'm not trying to rush us, but if there's

39:34.651 --> 39:37.252
a part of you that might want that...

39:49.633 --> 39:51.966
He left me all these clues

39:51.968 --> 39:54.217
pointing to an old
story about the Sirens.

39:54.242 --> 39:55.803
You have a few more degrees than I do.

39:55.805 --> 39:57.105
What do you know about them?

39:57.107 --> 39:59.173
There are different origin stories.

39:59.175 --> 40:01.876
Uh, Greek, Pagan mythologies.

40:01.878 --> 40:04.379
I mean, all the legends are
based in the same idea.

40:04.381 --> 40:05.780
Sirens use mind control

40:05.782 --> 40:07.849
to lure their victims to their death.

40:07.851 --> 40:11.185
Some say they're messengers of the devil.

40:11.187 --> 40:13.421
Something has control over them.

40:13.423 --> 40:16.157
Do you think Sirens could be real?

40:16.159 --> 40:17.859
To be honest, Bonnie, I...

40:17.861 --> 40:20.128
I don't know what to think anymore.

40:20.130 --> 40:23.765
I suppose every story
has to start somewhere.

40:25.135 --> 40:28.567
"They bewitch everybody
who approaches them.

40:28.592 --> 40:30.348
"There is no homecoming for the man

40:30.373 --> 40:32.173
who draws near them unawares.

40:34.344 --> 40:37.078
...with their high clear song,
the Sirens bewitch him..."

40:40.116 --> 40:42.273
"...as they sit there in
a meadow piled high with

40:42.298 --> 40:44.385
the moldering skeletons of men...

40:47.524 --> 40:50.692
...whose withered skin still
hangs upon their bones."

40:50.694 --> 40:52.160
How very poetic.

40:52.162 --> 40:54.529
Not just poetic. It's real.

40:54.531 --> 40:56.531
The bodies I saw.

40:56.533 --> 40:58.433
The clues Enzo left.

40:58.435 --> 41:01.035
He wants us to know who the enemy is.

41:01.037 --> 41:04.005
He wants us to help them fight it.

41:27.564 --> 41:29.430
What is that?

41:31.868 --> 41:34.936
If I had to guess,
I'd say it was singing.

41:45.648 --> 41:49.083
Well, I guess she finally
had enough to eat.
