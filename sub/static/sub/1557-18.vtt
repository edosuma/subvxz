WEBVTT

00:02.069 --> 00:04.336
You're still
on that thing?

00:04.338 --> 00:06.538
What are you constantly
looking at on your computer?

00:06.540 --> 00:07.840
Is that a question
you <i> really</i> want people
asking around here?

00:07.842 --> 00:09.141
Indeed, it is not.

00:09.143 --> 00:11.043
I'm just checking
college acceptances.

00:11.045 --> 00:12.444
I mean, they should be
posting them any day.

00:12.446 --> 00:14.179
You cannot spend
your entire spring break

00:14.181 --> 00:15.948
Worrying about
college admissions.

00:15.950 --> 00:18.684
You should go to that... that
music festival thing with Haley.

00:18.686 --> 00:20.486
Do something fun.
Learn to relax a...

00:20.488 --> 00:22.855
Do we have to keep every remote
we have ever owned?

00:22.857 --> 00:26.158
Somewhere in a landfill,
a laserdisc just ejected.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.193
Uh, I can't bring Alex
to the festival

00:28.195 --> 00:31.196
Because I am going for work
to research new fashion trends.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.865
I need to blend in,
you know?

00:32.867 --> 00:34.666
Everyone will think
she's a cop.

00:34.668 --> 00:37.669
Well, I could sit here
and worry and ruin <i> my</i> day,

00:37.671 --> 00:39.872
Or I could go with Haley
and ruin <i> hers.</i>

00:39.874 --> 00:41.507
I'll grab my sunscreen.

00:41.509 --> 00:43.409
Good morning.
Hey, dad.

00:43.411 --> 00:45.844
I hate to shame you,
but Haley woke up before you.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.546
Well, Haley didn't run
a 10k yesterday

00:47.548 --> 00:49.081
To raise awareness
for alopecia.

00:49.083 --> 00:50.349
What's alopecia?

00:50.351 --> 00:51.917
That is why I run.

00:51.919 --> 00:53.485
Honey, I could
really use your help

00:53.487 --> 00:55.054
With spring cleaning
today.

00:55.056 --> 00:56.889
I got to get all these boxes
down to the donation center.

00:56.891 --> 00:59.224
Wish I could,
but I've got work.

00:59.226 --> 01:00.926
Then Luke and I have got some
important trampolining to do.

01:00.928 --> 01:03.996
I just love how equally
we divide our responsibilities.

01:03.998 --> 01:05.697
Figured we'd do a little
father/son bonding

01:05.699 --> 01:07.399
Since your school trip
was canceled.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.101
Oh. You can teach me
the Dunphy tuck.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.704
I love your enthusiasm, son,
but it's way too dangerous.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.673
One wrong move,
and you're eating springs.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.241
Oh, no, no, those are...

01:16.243 --> 01:18.610
Is that my banjo?
Hmm?

01:18.612 --> 01:20.913
When I met this little lady
sitting next to me,

01:20.915 --> 01:22.781
It was love at first sight.

01:22.783 --> 01:25.117
Yep, I've been noodling around
on the ol' flyswatter

01:25.119 --> 01:27.086
For a couple of years now.

01:27.088 --> 01:29.688
I was inspired by the greats...
Scruggs, kermit.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.356
It's hard to practice, though,

01:31.358 --> 01:33.592
Because it gets Claire
so hot and bothered.

01:37.564 --> 01:39.031
? What do you...?

01:39.033 --> 01:41.300
I think I've heard enough.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.105
Lucky for you,
I've got time

01:46.107 --> 01:47.806
For a couple verses
of "shortnin' bread."

01:47.808 --> 01:49.241
No, no, no, no, no.

01:49.243 --> 01:51.243
No, no, it's in the box.
It's leaving the house.

01:51.245 --> 01:52.978
I-I can never hear
that awful thing again.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.646
But you called me "banjovi."
I know.

01:54.648 --> 01:56.882
I did whatever was necessary
to make it stop.

01:56.884 --> 01:58.884
Wait. Does that mean you also
didn't like my bagpiping?

01:58.886 --> 02:00.252
Is that why
we have Luke?!

02:00.254 --> 02:01.453
It's not.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.088
Is it?

02:15.468 --> 02:18.270
Ay, Cam,
no dessert for you?
No, none for me.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.671
I have to fit into
a skintight cat costume tonight

02:19.673 --> 02:21.073
Because I'm gonna...

02:21.075 --> 02:22.941
Whatever you do
behind closed doors

02:22.943 --> 02:24.610
Is your own business.

02:24.612 --> 02:26.645
Because I'm singing "memory"
at the faculty follies.

02:26.647 --> 02:27.980
It's a fundraiser

02:27.982 --> 02:29.781
Where the teachers
do a little talent show.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.150
Ay,
maybe I come see you.

02:31.152 --> 02:32.818
I need to find
something to watch

02:32.820 --> 02:34.620
Since I had to give up
my soap operas.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.121
Oh, because you've been
neglecting Joe?

02:36.123 --> 02:38.790
No, it's because I asked Jay
to stop smoking cigars,

02:38.792 --> 02:40.459
And he said
that he would quit

02:40.461 --> 02:42.661
If I stopped watching
the soap operas.

02:42.663 --> 02:43.929
But it's very hard.

02:43.931 --> 02:45.264
What's so damn hard?

02:45.266 --> 02:46.798
It's the same thing
every week...

02:46.800 --> 02:48.200
Amnesia, evil twins,

02:48.202 --> 02:50.269
Two ladies end up fighting
in a fountain.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.804
I mean, what is it?
Is it some sort of an escape?

02:52.806 --> 02:56.041
It's better than blowing
smoke in our baby's face.

02:56.043 --> 02:58.010
Where did he go,
anyways?

02:58.012 --> 03:00.012
Oh, there's an e-mail
from Lily's scout Camp.

03:00.014 --> 03:01.980
I hope everything's okay.
She's fine.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.949
Mitchell's nervous
because he's not a Camper.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.651
His idea of roughing it
is a hotel stay

03:05.653 --> 03:07.319
Where the cable
doesn't get bravo.

03:07.321 --> 03:09.521
They should tell you that
when you check in.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.323
Oh, boy.
Okay, here's a photo, look.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.292
She's using the signal.
What signal?

03:13.294 --> 03:14.960
The kids aren't allowed
to call their parents,

03:14.962 --> 03:17.696
But the Camp sends out photos,
so we have a code.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.298
Yeah, "we."

03:19.300 --> 03:21.333
One finger, she's fine.
Two fingers, she's unhappy.

03:21.335 --> 03:23.035
Look at this...
Two fingers.

03:23.037 --> 03:24.503
I don't look at pictures
on a phone.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.505
If it's a good shot,
get a print, put it in an album.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.240
Interesting time
to take a stand.

03:28.242 --> 03:29.841
But she looks
like she's just doing

03:29.843 --> 03:31.543
The bunny ears
behind her girlfriend.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.145
Which is exactly
what she would do

03:33.147 --> 03:35.047
To get a secret signal
past the authorities.

03:35.049 --> 03:36.915
Okay, it's a scout Camp,
not leavenworth.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.817
She's smiling.
What are you worried about?

03:38.819 --> 03:42.154
Because it's her first time
away from home. It...

03:42.156 --> 03:44.022
You know what?
That's probably it.

03:44.024 --> 03:45.591
I'm just...
I'm stressing out, so...

03:45.593 --> 03:47.326
You know, I'm... I'm gonna
go to the office

03:47.328 --> 03:48.727
And pick up
some paperwork.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.262
You know what?
I'm gonna tag along with you.

03:50.264 --> 03:51.597
You can drop me off
at the club.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.165
I'm not really going
to the office.

03:53.167 --> 03:54.533
Don't care.
Need a cigar.

03:57.238 --> 03:59.371
Based off the walk
I just took,

03:59.373 --> 04:01.440
Side-boob is
the new butt crack.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.442
So, you want
to head down front?

04:03.444 --> 04:04.710
Alex!

04:04.712 --> 04:06.111
Okay,
you need to drink this.

04:06.113 --> 04:08.080
I'll get a new one.

04:08.082 --> 04:09.381
Uh, is there vodka
in here?

04:09.383 --> 04:10.782
If there is, it's not

04:10.784 --> 04:13.585
Doing anybody any good
until I get it in <i> there.</i>

04:15.021 --> 04:16.688
Michelangelo talked
about chiseling

04:16.690 --> 04:18.390
Beautiful sculptures
out of marble.

04:18.392 --> 04:21.059
Well,<i> my</i> chisel
is a long island iced tea,

04:21.060 --> 04:24.596
And I use it to free the party
girl from the block of nerd.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.932
Music!!

04:26.934 --> 04:29.468
Yeah!

04:29.470 --> 04:32.804
Not all my sculptures
are masterpieces.

04:32.806 --> 04:34.806
Hey.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.408
I'm ho...

04:44.751 --> 04:46.385
Oh, amazing!

04:47.655 --> 04:49.655
Honey, were you listening?
Isn't he good?

04:49.657 --> 04:51.056
Really good.
Yeah.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.424
<i>Really</i> good.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.326
I... I thought
you didn't like the banjo.

04:54.328 --> 04:55.794
I didn't think I did,
either,

04:55.796 --> 04:57.262
But there's just something
about the way he plays.

04:57.264 --> 04:59.298
It's so...
It's so musical.

04:59.300 --> 05:02.100
Mm-hmm. So, what's this,
a surprise for old dad?

05:02.102 --> 05:04.469
You been secretly taking lessons
for months, probably longer?

05:04.471 --> 05:06.438
Nope. I just started
messing around with it today.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.607
And you learned
a whole song.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.842
Actually, he learned <i> two!</i>
Play him the other one.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.444
I'm good, thanks.

05:12.446 --> 05:14.112
Are those my shoes?

05:14.114 --> 05:15.914
I found them
in the box of donations.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.182
They fit him perfectly.

05:17.184 --> 05:18.917
If anything,
they're a little snug.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.285
Well,
he can kick them off,

05:20.287 --> 05:22.020
'cause we are about to do
some trampolining.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.588
Time to learn
the Dunphy tuck.

05:23.590 --> 05:25.357
I thought you said
he could get hurt doing that.

05:25.359 --> 05:26.925
It's impossible
to be safe all the time.

05:26.927 --> 05:29.995
You can get hurt just
walking into your own house.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.596
Okay, I'm gonna
go hang my costume up

05:31.598 --> 05:33.665
In my dressing room
and start warming up my voice.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.467
Dressing room? Ay, show me.

05:35.469 --> 05:37.469
I can't. It's the handicapped
stall in the men's room.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.137
But tonight
is not about Cameron Tucker.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.440
It's about the kids.
? me-me-me-me-me-me?

05:41.442 --> 05:43.608
- Coach Tucker.
- SeÃ±or kaplan.

05:43.610 --> 05:46.111
Oh. What is that,
a caveman costume?

05:46.113 --> 05:48.447
No, I just signed up
to sing "memory" from "cats."

05:48.449 --> 05:50.882
Although I hope I'm not on
after the "grease" chorus.

05:50.884 --> 05:52.451
They're a tough act
to follow.

05:52.453 --> 05:55.821
"Memory"?
But that is your song.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.522
"Memory"?
But that was
<i>his</i> song.
Two cat costumes?

05:57.524 --> 05:59.124
Well, we can't both
sing the same song.

05:59.126 --> 06:01.026
I mean, that would make
a mockery of the follies.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.861
Oh, well,
I sang last year.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.629
Please, I insist...
<i>You</i> sing.

06:04.631 --> 06:06.698
He gave up his song.
That was his song
last year.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.033
Fate will smile
upon him.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.334
You would do that
for me?

06:09.336 --> 06:11.336
This is literally
the nicest gesture

06:11.338 --> 06:14.172
I have ever witnessed...
And I'm from canada.

06:14.174 --> 06:16.074
I don't like this.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.377
This is just like
when rosalba and marisol

06:18.379 --> 06:21.012
Found out that they were
married to the same man.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.881
Marisol backed down,

06:22.883 --> 06:25.317
But she was found dead
two days later.

06:25.319 --> 06:26.918
Okay, Gloria,
I think there's a chance

06:26.920 --> 06:28.754
You're trying to turn
a very normal situation

06:28.756 --> 06:30.055
Into one of
your soap operas.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.257
Okay, but imagine...

06:32.259 --> 06:35.093
A standing ovation for you
will crush him!

06:35.095 --> 06:36.695
You know what?

06:36.697 --> 06:38.530
I'll only look better
if I take the high road...

06:38.532 --> 06:42.601
You know, help out backstage,
let him have his moment.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.669
Oh, my goodness!

06:53.246 --> 06:54.846
The move you're about to see
was first developed

06:54.848 --> 06:56.448
By my great-great-great-
grandfather razvan Dunphy,

06:56.450 --> 06:59.951
But, really, it's as old
as man's quest to fly.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.353
It's just a flip
with a twist, right?

07:01.355 --> 07:03.355
There's a lot more going on,

07:03.357 --> 07:05.123
But you won't be able
to absorb it

07:05.125 --> 07:07.759
The first time
you see it.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.961
<i>Eins... Zwei... Drei...</i>

07:09.963 --> 07:11.430
No good. Okay.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.465
Oh. You were right.
I totally missed it.

07:13.467 --> 07:15.634
I'm glad that happened.
I'm actually glad that happened.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.303
It's a good reminder...
The Dunphy tuck demands respect.

07:18.305 --> 07:21.273
This... Time... For...

07:21.275 --> 07:23.108
Real!

07:23.110 --> 07:24.376
Ohh.

07:24.378 --> 07:26.711
Jim mckay, that hurts!

07:26.713 --> 07:29.448
I'm gonna...
Just adjust these springs.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.917
They feel fine to me.
I'm sure they do.

07:31.919 --> 07:34.219
You don't have the foot
sensitivity of a tramp champ.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.955
If I ever
had to read braille, I'd...

07:36.957 --> 07:38.990
Oh, my god!
I think I did it!

07:38.992 --> 07:41.493
Did I do it?
Almost. Yeah.

07:41.495 --> 07:43.462
Your... your form
was a little off.

07:43.464 --> 07:45.831
Really? It <i> felt</i> perfect.
I'll try one more time.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.566
I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.

07:47.568 --> 07:50.402
You might cement in
some bad... Habits.

07:50.404 --> 07:51.770
I did it again!

07:51.772 --> 07:53.305
I'm gonna get you some water.

07:53.307 --> 07:55.907
You seem lightheaded
and delusional.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.843
Again!

07:59.912 --> 08:01.580
Oh, honey.
You look exhausted.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.682
Well, I am not.
I am as strong as ever.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.917
Certainly the strongest person
in the house.

08:05.919 --> 08:08.753
Is Luke doing the Dunphy tuck?

08:08.755 --> 08:10.455
Sort of a poor man's version
of it.

08:10.457 --> 08:12.624
Wow. He added
a whole new twist.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.526
It's called over-rotation.
Look into it.

08:14.528 --> 08:16.595
I was so caught up
in my spring cleaning,

08:16.597 --> 08:21.199
It took me a while to see that
Phil was feeling inadequate.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.201
I knew what I needed to do.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.970
When you guys
are done out there,

08:24.972 --> 08:27.138
Do you think
you could give Luke my list?

08:27.140 --> 08:29.708
I have some chores on here
that require some muscle.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.776
Maybe <i> I</i> should
take care of that.
Nah.

08:31.778 --> 08:33.611
No, no,
I-I-I can handle it.

08:33.614 --> 08:36.280
Luke's pretty busy out there
not pointing his toes.

08:36.283 --> 08:37.649
So he's all like,
"get a life,"

08:37.650 --> 08:39.284
And I'm like,
"no, thanks. Got nine."

08:39.285 --> 08:41.986
I mean, 'cause...

08:41.989 --> 08:44.489
Sorry to interrupt, but I just
took a break from painting.

08:44.491 --> 08:46.291
Wanted to come over,
bring you some tea

08:46.293 --> 08:48.727
And tell you to break a paw.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.328
He almost broke his <i> head.</i>

08:50.330 --> 08:51.997
Yes, I know,
and I feel horrible about that.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.398
I-I hope you know

08:53.400 --> 08:55.901
I would never intentionally
do anything to harm...

08:55.903 --> 08:58.336
Oh! My throat!
It burns!

08:58.338 --> 08:59.905
He made the tea too hot!
Not on purpose!

08:59.907 --> 09:01.406
Oh! Oh!

09:02.642 --> 09:04.142
He tripped on one of
coach Tucker's paint cans.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.744
I don't remember
leaving that there!

09:05.746 --> 09:09.314
Oh, look at me.
I can't command a stage.

09:09.316 --> 09:11.349
You... you have to
take my place.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.485
We'll wheel you
out onto stage.

09:13.487 --> 09:14.819
Oh, come on...
We both know

09:14.821 --> 09:16.388
This song requires
catlike movements.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.623
Someone get this man
into fur and makeup!

09:20.026 --> 09:22.994
What are you doing?!

09:22.996 --> 09:25.163
Last item on the list...
move the table.
No. You should not
be doing that alone.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.932
Really? 'Cause I got
the fridge out to the curb.
How?

09:26.934 --> 09:28.667
Drug it. Stand back.
I'm turtling her.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.101
No, you're gonna
get hurt, sweetie.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.103
Let me get Luke. Luke!
No, no, no!

09:32.105 --> 09:34.773
I don't need his help!
Let him play his precious banjo!

09:36.709 --> 09:39.010
It was like
the banjo was mocking me.

09:39.012 --> 09:41.780
? You are not the man
you used to be?

09:41.782 --> 09:43.515
? You get up four times at night
to pee?

09:43.517 --> 09:44.849
? Ba-da-dum ba bat da
doot doot doo?

09:44.851 --> 09:46.952
? You're super-duper old now?

09:46.954 --> 09:49.354
Hey! Take five.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.957
I don't know that one.
Give me a couple minutes.
I'll figure it out.

09:51.959 --> 09:54.025
It's a little hard to get
things done with all the noise.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.293
What's that?

09:55.295 --> 09:57.262
Uh... Nothing.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.030
Is that...

09:59.032 --> 10:00.432
A bra?

10:00.434 --> 10:02.200
You're not supposed to
have girls up here.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.803
I can explain.
You don't have to!

10:04.805 --> 10:07.038
You think you're an adult,
but you're not.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.940
You're a kid
living under <i> my</i> roof,

10:08.942 --> 10:10.208
And you have to obey
<i>my</i> rules!

10:11.478 --> 10:13.144
Ow!
The "g" string snapped!

10:13.146 --> 10:15.647
Probably not the first time
that's happened in here.

10:15.649 --> 10:18.083
No! It hit my eye!
Is it bleeding?

10:18.085 --> 10:19.918
First of all,
eyes can't bleed, so...

10:19.920 --> 10:22.387
Sammy davis jr.,
that's bad!

10:22.389 --> 10:24.055
Alex!

10:24.057 --> 10:25.256
Oh. Hi.

10:25.258 --> 10:26.558
I'm looking
for my sister.

10:26.560 --> 10:27.792
She has brown hair,

10:27.794 --> 10:29.461
Dressed like a nerd,
but not ironically.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.897
Hang on!

10:32.899 --> 10:34.733
Hello?

10:34.735 --> 10:37.335
Haley, are you with Alex?
She's not answering her phone.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.004
Uh, yeah, yeah.

10:39.006 --> 10:41.473
We're just a tiny bit
separated right now,

10:41.475 --> 10:44.009
But, uh, she's been acting
a little strange.

10:44.011 --> 10:46.011
Oh, no.
What do you mean?

10:46.013 --> 10:48.346
Um, I... well,
I-I'd say she's been, um...

10:48.348 --> 10:49.981
A bit distant.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.416
Oh, no.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.184
Mom, don't freak out.

10:53.186 --> 10:56.287
No, I was worried about this
when you two left this morning.

10:56.289 --> 10:59.157
Oh, okay, so she was being
a little uptight.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.826
Come on!
Open up, you stupid thing!

11:01.828 --> 11:04.462
Okay, fine!
She was a total buzzkill, okay!

11:04.464 --> 11:07.132
I just wanted
to relax her.
Damn it.

11:07.134 --> 11:09.768
I know, I know...
It was a mistake.

11:09.770 --> 11:12.037
But it's not like
I poured it down her throat!

11:12.039 --> 11:13.371
She didn't
get into harvard.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.973
Oh, thank god!

11:14.975 --> 11:17.142
<i>That's</i> why
she's been acting so weird.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.777
Wait. What do you mean, you
didn't pour it down her throat?

11:18.779 --> 11:20.011
Did you get her drunk?

11:20.013 --> 11:22.714
Hey,
<i>you</i> hacked her computer!

11:22.716 --> 11:24.215
Is that her?

11:25.551 --> 11:27.485
Uh, I just found her.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.521
I'll have her call you.

11:30.823 --> 11:33.224
Take me to my sister!

11:33.226 --> 11:34.659
Oh. Oh, hi.

11:34.661 --> 11:36.695
Oh. Whoo!

11:36.697 --> 11:38.697
All right, Lily's Camp is
just through those trees.

11:38.699 --> 11:40.165
I'll be back soon.
Take your time.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.634
I got a couple of robustos
to keep me company.

11:42.636 --> 11:44.803
Um, what's up
with the outfit?

11:44.805 --> 11:47.038
It's to keep the smoke off me
so Gloria won't smell it.

11:47.040 --> 11:49.074
That's insane.
Yep, I've lost my mind.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.209
Have fun breaking your daughter
out of sleepaway Camp.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.811
Oh, of course
you wouldn't understand.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.045
Why?

11:54.047 --> 11:55.513
Um... You forgot?

11:55.515 --> 11:57.549
I forgot I shouldn't ask "why"
to things.

11:57.551 --> 12:00.018
I was 9 years old, at Camp.

12:00.020 --> 12:02.353
There were mosquitos,
compost toilets, mean kids.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.089
It was theater Camp,
wasn't it?

12:04.091 --> 12:05.824
Naturally,
you remember <i> that</i> part.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.225
T-the point is,
I hated it.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.060
I was... I was cold,
and I was scared,

12:09.062 --> 12:13.164
Especially after this kid told
this terrifying ghost story,

12:13.166 --> 12:16.401
So I snuck away to a pay phone,
I called you, crying,

12:16.403 --> 12:19.337
And in a performance
even more predictable

12:19.339 --> 12:21.439
Than todd jansen's
artful dodger,

12:21.441 --> 12:23.541
You refused
to pick me up.

12:23.543 --> 12:24.776
For your own good.

12:24.778 --> 12:26.611
Learning
to fend for yourself

12:26.613 --> 12:28.713
Is an important part
of becoming a man.

12:28.715 --> 12:30.882
Before you claim
that all my professional success

12:30.884 --> 12:33.351
Stems from
your <i> very,</i> very brave decision

12:33.353 --> 12:36.121
To stay at home on the couch
watching "the bionic woman,"

12:36.123 --> 12:37.589
I am going to go get Lily

12:37.591 --> 12:40.592
So that she knows
she can always count on me.

12:42.628 --> 12:44.095
It's fine.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.631
If that's your idea
of a dramatic exit,

12:46.633 --> 12:49.267
It's no wonder
todd jansen got that part.

12:55.307 --> 12:56.608
So, the doctor will see you
in a few minutes.

12:56.610 --> 12:58.042
Nice <i> someone</i> can see.

12:58.044 --> 12:59.310
Glad to know
your good eye can still roll.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.813
So, still angry, huh?

13:01.815 --> 13:03.782
Gee,
why would I be angry?

13:03.784 --> 13:05.984
Because you insulted me,
maimed me, and belittled

13:05.986 --> 13:07.952
My achievements in the banjonic
and trampolinic arts?

13:07.954 --> 13:09.287
I know. I'm sorry.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.989
I'm not proud
of my behavior today.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.425
It probably started
with the 5k I ran yesterday.

13:14.427 --> 13:15.760
10k.

13:15.762 --> 13:17.495
For everyone else.

13:17.497 --> 13:21.132
It was the first time
in 15 years I couldn't finish.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.168
Then, today, it's everything
I can do, you can do better.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.637
No, I can't.
Yes, you can.

13:25.639 --> 13:28.840
It's okay.
It's not your fault.

13:28.842 --> 13:30.942
Every dad
goes through it...

13:30.944 --> 13:33.178
The day he starts
seeing his son as a man

13:33.180 --> 13:35.346
And not a boy.

13:35.348 --> 13:36.748
It's a shock.

13:36.750 --> 13:38.817
Like when we first got
high-def tv

13:38.819 --> 13:41.286
And I realized
ed bradley had an earring.

13:41.288 --> 13:43.321
I'm not as much of a man
as you think, dad.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.589
Oh, really?

13:44.591 --> 13:46.024
How come an hour ago,

13:46.026 --> 13:48.693
I had a 16-year-old girl's bra
in my hand?

13:49.929 --> 13:51.596
Can we talk
somewhere more private?

13:51.598 --> 13:52.897
Mm-hmm.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.334
The bra belongs to <i> me.</i>

13:56.336 --> 13:59.938
Oh... Kay.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.507
That's not the conversation
I thought we'd be having,

14:02.509 --> 14:04.843
But... If that's what you need
on the outside

14:04.845 --> 14:07.111
To feel like the Luke you are
on the <i> inside...</i>

14:07.113 --> 14:08.313
No!

14:08.315 --> 14:10.181
It's to practice on.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.517
I stink
at unhooking them.

14:12.519 --> 14:15.720
Last week, I tried to take one
off a girl at a party.

14:15.722 --> 14:19.157
I fumbled for so long,
she started to laugh.

14:19.159 --> 14:20.358
It still haunts me.

14:23.730 --> 14:27.398
That's why
I didn't go away this week.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.900
My trip wasn't canceled.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.401
Everyone found out and...

14:30.403 --> 14:32.503
I get it...
You couldn't face them.

14:32.505 --> 14:34.172
Listen, I know
this part of your life

14:34.174 --> 14:35.807
May not be moving
fast enough for you,

14:35.809 --> 14:37.542
But enjoy it
while it lasts.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.744
Someday, your life's gonna be
moving faster than you want,

14:39.746 --> 14:41.412
And you could wind up
doing something dumb,

14:41.414 --> 14:42.714
Like blinding your son.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.415
I'm blind?!
Probably not.

14:44.417 --> 14:47.185
Luke Dunphy?

14:49.256 --> 14:51.856
I know I'm getting a little old
for this place, but...

14:51.858 --> 14:53.558
I do like coming here.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.261
Oh, Lukey!

14:56.263 --> 14:57.662
You hurt your eye.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.063
Do you need a hug?

14:59.065 --> 15:00.431
A big one.

15:00.433 --> 15:01.933
Come here.

15:04.003 --> 15:05.436
Alex!
Alex, stop!

15:05.438 --> 15:07.505
I have been chasing you
for, like, an hour!

15:07.507 --> 15:09.040
Where are you going?!
Uh...

15:09.042 --> 15:10.275
This guy weasel
said he knows

15:10.277 --> 15:11.576
Of some hot springs
in the hills.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.344
We were just gonna go
try and find them.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.613
Oh, okay. So, we'll see you
in, like, what, 10 years,

15:15.615 --> 15:17.916
When you spoon-tunnel your way
out of weasel's basement?

15:19.219 --> 15:20.618
I know about harvard.

15:23.355 --> 15:24.622
How?

15:24.624 --> 15:25.890
Mom saw
on your computer.

15:25.892 --> 15:27.692
And of course
she told you,

15:27.694 --> 15:30.061
Because privacy
doesn't mean anything.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.963
Why do things
the right way?

15:31.965 --> 15:33.631
Alex, I r...
No! What's the point?

15:33.633 --> 15:35.767
Get straight a's
for 10 years,

15:35.769 --> 15:38.269
Spend your summers
building houses,

15:38.271 --> 15:40.805
Drag your cello to school
every day,

15:40.807 --> 15:43.574
Write the perfect essay,
and for what?!

15:43.576 --> 15:46.277
"No, thank you, Alex!"

15:46.279 --> 15:48.413
"we don't want you,
Alex!"

15:48.415 --> 15:51.082
Okay, you are drawing
more attention to yourself

15:51.084 --> 15:53.217
Than the guy
wearing a ferret as a scarf.

15:53.219 --> 15:54.786
I don't care anymore!

15:54.788 --> 15:57.622
I've spent my entire life
trying to be perfect,

15:57.624 --> 15:59.090
And where did it get me?

15:59.092 --> 16:02.727
I am in a field
with 6,000 idiots!

16:04.497 --> 16:06.998
Know what? I think that this is
a good thing for you.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.300
Can you just
spare me today?
No.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.802
You're obviously
going to get into

16:10.804 --> 16:12.103
One of those
snooty schools,

16:12.105 --> 16:15.006
And sometimes
you're gonna come in second...

16:15.008 --> 16:18.609
Or fourth,
or maybe even tenth.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.678
But you're gonna
dust yourself off,

16:20.680 --> 16:23.448
Maybe put on some lipstick
for once, and keep going.

16:23.450 --> 16:26.651
I'm allowed to feel bad
about this, okay?

16:26.653 --> 16:29.153
Look,
you are a superstar!

16:29.155 --> 16:30.621
I've been saying
since you were 10

16:30.623 --> 16:32.657
You're gonna be
on the supreme court.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.125
Thanks.

16:34.127 --> 16:36.427
But for the record,
I'm gonna be a scientist.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.830
Lab coat, robe...

16:38.832 --> 16:40.665
As long as something's
covering up your outfit,

16:40.667 --> 16:42.633
You're gonna be
just fine.

16:45.972 --> 16:48.840
I...Don't want to talk about it.

16:48.842 --> 16:51.142
I had killed with that song
at three amateur productions,

16:51.144 --> 16:54.312
Two gay weddings, and a two-hour
gate hold on a 747,

16:54.314 --> 16:56.614
But I could tell
the audience thought

16:56.616 --> 16:59.851
That I had sabotaged kaplan
to grab the spotlight,

16:59.853 --> 17:02.887
And my confidence caught in my
throat like a three-day furball.

17:02.889 --> 17:04.521
I couldn't
have stunk up the place worse

17:04.523 --> 17:06.624
If I'd performed
in a litter box.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.628
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.333
Bravo, Cameron.

17:15.335 --> 17:17.468
Can't talk!
I'll be in my stall!

17:19.538 --> 17:23.141
So, now
<i>everybody</i> hates Cameron.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.909
Okay, look,
I can't sing "memory."

17:24.911 --> 17:26.344
It's too much song for me.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.179
So when I found out
that coach Tucker

17:28.181 --> 17:30.348
Wanted to sing it, as well,
I had my out...

17:30.350 --> 17:32.383
Until
he nobly stepped aside.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.819
Luckily, the sandbag fell,
everyone blamed him,

17:34.821 --> 17:36.320
And I just saw
my opening.

17:36.322 --> 17:38.089
I put the paint cans
on the floor

17:38.091 --> 17:40.925
And pretended
that the tea scalded me.

17:40.927 --> 17:43.394
But to see him crash and burn
on stage, that...

17:43.396 --> 17:45.930
it doesn't get better than that.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.598
Oh, it's about to,

17:47.600 --> 17:49.567
Because I turned
your microphone on,

17:49.569 --> 17:51.102
And everybody there
is listening

17:51.104 --> 17:52.603
To everything
that you just said!

17:52.605 --> 17:54.705
No. No!
No, no, no, no, no, no.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.074
You monster!
Now, hold on.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.775
Aah! Ooh-hoo-hoo! Ooh!

17:57.777 --> 17:59.944
Amazing!
And with no commercials!

17:59.946 --> 18:02.046
Ooh! Ooh!

18:02.048 --> 18:03.714
The worst thing about the woods

18:03.716 --> 18:05.616
Is you never know
what you're gonna run into...

18:05.618 --> 18:08.920
A bear, a hunter who doesn't
take kindly to city folk,

18:08.922 --> 18:10.388
Or worse...

18:10.390 --> 18:12.623
I can't wait.
I love s'mores.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.892
...Your daughter, as happy
as you've ever seen her.

18:14.894 --> 18:17.195
The only thing to do
was to sneak back to the car

18:17.197 --> 18:19.464
And think of a lie
to tell my dad along the way.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.199
What was that?!

18:21.201 --> 18:23.401
I don't know,
but let's hit it with a shovel.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.303
And stab it
with our marshmallow sticks!

18:25.305 --> 18:26.604
Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah!

18:26.606 --> 18:28.306
No! No, no, no, no!
I-I'm Lily's dad.

18:28.308 --> 18:29.774
I'm Lily...
Hi. She's mine.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.642
Um...
What are you doing here?

18:31.644 --> 18:34.612
Okay, I-I thought
you gave me the signal.
No! Go away.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.981
You're embarrassing me
in front of 8-year-olds.
Sorry.

18:36.983 --> 18:39.117
I just finished
telling the girls a ghost story.

18:39.119 --> 18:41.619
It was <i> so</i> scary.
Do you know any?

18:41.621 --> 18:43.454
I do know one
from my own Camp days,

18:43.456 --> 18:45.456
But it's probably
too scary for you, s...

18:45.458 --> 18:47.058
Tell us now!
Okay, okay.

18:47.060 --> 18:50.628
It's really scary.
Don't say I didn't warn you.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.563
This better be good.

18:52.565 --> 18:53.998
Um... Well...

18:54.000 --> 18:57.435
I-it takes place
at a Camp a lot like this one,

18:57.437 --> 19:00.738
Where just beyond the woods,
there was a black lake.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.674
And just beyond the lake,
there was a prison.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.076
This isn't scary.

19:05.078 --> 19:07.245
Okay,
it was a haunted pr...

19:07.247 --> 19:09.614
It was a haunted prison.

19:09.616 --> 19:12.750
Now, on this one night,
the night of the full moon,

19:12.752 --> 19:15.186
What they call
"the blood moon"...

19:15.188 --> 19:17.755
oooooh!

19:17.757 --> 19:20.158
Okay, what was at this prison
was a... was a ghost...

19:20.160 --> 19:24.028
The ghost of an old man
with glowing red eyes,

19:24.030 --> 19:26.030
Who breathed fire!

19:26.032 --> 19:28.199
I'm bored.
Can we go to sleep early?

19:28.201 --> 19:30.835
I think you're forgetting
about the blood moon.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.970
What's that?!

19:32.972 --> 19:35.439
- Glowing eyes!
- It's the ghost!

19:35.441 --> 19:37.375
It's the ghost!
No! Oh!

19:37.377 --> 19:39.510
Girls!

19:39.512 --> 19:41.712
Thanks for that.
Bedtime should be a treat.

19:43.715 --> 19:46.150
Well, I guess
you finally rescued me at Camp.

19:46.152 --> 19:48.152
Better late than never.

19:48.154 --> 19:50.655
By the way,
I should've come by

19:50.657 --> 19:52.190
And picked you up
from Camp.

19:52.192 --> 19:53.791
That, uh,
"tough it out" stuff...

19:53.793 --> 19:55.359
That was my dad
talking.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.862
He threw me in a lake once
I was afraid of.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.064
Did I ever tell you
about that story?
Yeah, yeah,
we've all heard that story.

20:00.066 --> 20:02.033
Now, don't feel too bad.

20:02.035 --> 20:04.168
I was completely wrong
about Lily.

20:04.170 --> 20:06.737
I almost rescued her from having
the time of her life.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.472
Oh, that's the way
of things.

20:08.474 --> 20:10.174
Things work out,
and someday, you'll be able

20:10.176 --> 20:11.642
To see her be completely wrong
about <i> her</i> kids.

20:11.644 --> 20:12.877
It's fun.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.145
Oh. Okay.

20:14.147 --> 20:15.379
Cigar?

20:15.381 --> 20:17.014
No. No, thank you.

20:17.016 --> 20:19.650
You know, I... I once stole
one of those when I was a kid.

20:19.652 --> 20:20.885
Made me completely dizzy.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.520
I don't remember
the rest of the night.

20:22.522 --> 20:25.323
Aren't you going to
that faculty follies after this?

20:25.325 --> 20:26.824
Yeah.
Give me one of those.

20:32.497 --> 20:33.998
Huh. I thought
there was a step there.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.266
Oh, yeah, you'll get
your depth perception back

20:35.268 --> 20:37.068
Once you get
the bandages off.

20:37.070 --> 20:39.070
Careful in the middle, there.
I still haven't a chance to...

20:39.072 --> 20:40.271
I know.

20:40.273 --> 20:42.373
Oh!
I thought you were Alex.

20:42.375 --> 20:43.908
She didn't get in.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.110
Oh, no!
Stupid harvard.

20:46.112 --> 20:48.546
"Stupid harvard"? She didn't
get into princeton, either?

20:48.548 --> 20:49.880
No, just harvard.

20:49.882 --> 20:51.582
I thought
that this might soften the blow.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.284
And I made her
her favorite dinner.

20:53.286 --> 20:55.553
You're such a good mom.

20:55.555 --> 20:57.855
There she is!
Hi. I heard.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.290
I'm so sorry.

20:59.292 --> 21:01.692
Oh.
Uh, thanks, mom,

21:01.694 --> 21:04.061
But Haley already made me feel
a little better about it.

21:04.063 --> 21:06.297
I just don't really feel
like talking right now.

21:06.299 --> 21:08.933
I kind of just want to change
my password and get into bed.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.901
Okay.

21:10.903 --> 21:13.070
She just needs a little bit
of time to work through it.

21:13.072 --> 21:15.473
Hi.
Alone?

21:15.475 --> 21:17.908
The kids are growing up.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.777
Guess they don't need us
as much anymore.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.312
Oh, well,
that was the plan.

21:21.314 --> 21:23.114
I just thought it would
feel better than this.

21:23.116 --> 21:24.382
Me too.

21:24.384 --> 21:26.951
At least
we still need each other.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.320
How did I get so lucky?
Okay.

21:29.322 --> 21:30.888
Still got it!
Oh.
