WEBVTT

00:03.504 --> 00:07.440
Ray is missing
and I'm going to need
help in finding him.

00:09.943 --> 00:12.310
Magnum, what are you doing
with Mr. Masters' binoculars?

00:12.380 --> 00:14.814
Do you deal
with Hall of Records a lot?

00:15.683 --> 00:16.741
Next!

00:16.817 --> 00:18.978
Get off the case, Magnum.
You're getting in our way.

00:23.057 --> 00:24.456
Ray Jones!

00:26.827 --> 00:28.419
No. Wait a minute.
I know her.

00:28.496 --> 00:30.123
I know.
She's your sister.
No!

02:39.426 --> 02:40.688
Ray?

02:42.563 --> 02:43.552
Ray?

02:45.933 --> 02:48.663
Ray, I knew you'd come back.
Ray. Ray, come on.

02:49.036 --> 02:51.027
Come on, sweetie.
Where are...

02:53.574 --> 02:56.338
Who are you?
What do you want?

02:56.443 --> 02:57.808
Where's Ray Jones?

03:03.584 --> 03:04.812
Get her.

03:22.836 --> 03:24.633
Let's get out of here.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.140
<i>Here in Paradise,</i>

03:37.218 --> 03:40.187
<i>there are at least</i>
<i>three different ways</i>
<i>of looking at time.</i>

03:40.254 --> 03:42.745
<i>There's the traditional</i>
<i>mainland kind of time.</i>

03:42.823 --> 03:46.691
<i>People say, "Let's meet</i>
<i>at 8:00.</i> " <i>And that's more</i>
<i>or less what they mean.</i>

03:46.760 --> 03:50.457
<i>Then there's Hawaiian time,</i>
<i>which is a lot more flexible.</i>

03:50.598 --> 03:54.466
<i>8:00 may mean 7:00</i>
<i>or 9:00 or not at all,</i>

03:54.535 --> 03:57.060
<i>depending on</i>
<i>an infinite variety</i>
<i>of factors.</i>

03:57.338 --> 04:01.365
<i>However, even in Paradise</i>
<i>there's also a time frame</i>

04:01.442 --> 04:05.708
<i>which seems to operate</i>
<i>on a mysterious</i>
<i>circadian rhythm all its own.</i>

04:05.779 --> 04:07.303
<i>Bureaucratic time.</i>

04:07.381 --> 04:11.681
<i>Roughly, that translates into,</i>
<i>"Stand in line</i>
<i>until we're ready for you.</i>

04:11.752 --> 04:13.743
<i>"Then do it our way</i>
<i>or not at all."</i>

04:13.821 --> 04:17.723
Mr. Matsuda, I have
the basic title information
that you'll need.

04:17.791 --> 04:21.591
But I think you're going
to need to have
a new land survey taken.

04:21.862 --> 04:25.320
This early method
of determining property lines
by natural landmarks

04:25.399 --> 04:27.993
was ruled invalid
in 1937.

04:28.102 --> 04:32.698
And this is strictly
R-1 zoning. Residential
and agricultural use only.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.566
It says so on the title?

04:34.642 --> 04:36.633
Oh, no,
but if you'll recall,

04:36.710 --> 04:41.010
the Hanaui community
outlawed commercial
zoning in 1954.

04:42.116 --> 04:44.744
But I'm sure you must
be planning to farm the land,
right?

04:44.818 --> 04:49.255
Because with an annual
crop yield of 22%% above
the state average,

04:49.423 --> 04:51.823
now I ask you, what else
would you do with it?

04:51.892 --> 04:52.881
Yes.

04:53.060 --> 04:57.724
It's due to the unique
soil compound and the near
perfect sun-rain ratio.

04:58.766 --> 04:59.858
I'm sorry.

05:00.434 --> 05:03.562
You know all of this
or you wouldn't be
buying the land.

05:04.371 --> 05:07.238
I thought it would be
a nice place for a restaurant.

05:07.408 --> 05:08.568
Good day.

05:10.878 --> 05:14.678
Hey, that's incredible.
I mean, did you grow up
in Hanaui or something?

05:15.249 --> 05:17.114
Anyone who's ever spent
the day there

05:17.184 --> 05:20.085
knows a few vital statistics
about the area.

05:20.821 --> 05:21.947
Mr. Magnum.

05:22.056 --> 05:24.183
Ms. Jones,
I was wondering

05:24.258 --> 05:27.455
if anybody had been
able to get me the file
on Nigel Hucksby.

05:27.528 --> 05:29.519
Oh, yes.
It's right here.

05:31.198 --> 05:33.758
Mr. Magnum,

05:33.834 --> 05:36.667
I was wondering
if I might speak to you
privately.

05:37.604 --> 05:38.696
Ms. Jones?

05:38.772 --> 05:39.796
What?

05:39.873 --> 05:41.033
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.906
I've forgotten
how to get into
the classified file.

05:43.977 --> 05:48.505
Karen, please. I have
explained this process
to you twice.

05:48.816 --> 05:51.307
Would you please
try to remember?

05:51.485 --> 05:52.509
First, you...

05:52.586 --> 05:54.884
If you could just give me
the Hucksby file.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.219
Mr. Magnum,
just one moment. I'm busy.

05:57.291 --> 05:59.691
Well, so am I.
I'm trying to save
a little girl's life.

06:00.861 --> 06:01.850
No!

06:02.029 --> 06:03.257
Ms. Jones.

06:03.464 --> 06:06.092
Ray!
Ray, is it really you?

06:06.166 --> 06:07.360
Of course
it's really him.

06:07.434 --> 06:08.696
Do you mind?

06:08.769 --> 06:09.758
Sorry.

06:10.270 --> 06:14.070
Ray, where are you?
I have been worried
half to death.

06:14.641 --> 06:17.906
Well, of course I remember
what you said. But you always
say that when you leave.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.411
I know
you don't mean it.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.948
I'm sorry
if I interrupted
at a bad time.

06:22.182 --> 06:25.379
No, no. That's okay.
Are you new here?

06:25.452 --> 06:27.079
So when am I going
to see you, Ray?

06:27.154 --> 06:28.519
Yes, it's my first day.
I just transferred from DMV.

06:28.589 --> 06:29.613
I'm Karen Summers.

06:29.690 --> 06:30.782
Thomas Magnum. Hi.

06:30.858 --> 06:31.882
Hi.

06:31.959 --> 06:34.393
Do you deal
with Hall of Records a lot?

06:35.262 --> 06:36.752
From time to time.

06:36.830 --> 06:37.854
Good.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.762
Ray, I don't understand
what you're saying.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.926
You are saying never

06:42.436 --> 06:45.963
Means not ever.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.105
I love you, Ray.

06:48.442 --> 06:50.774
Don't do this to me,
Ray. Don't...

06:55.482 --> 06:57.347
That was
a personal conversation.

06:57.418 --> 06:58.680
We didn't mean
to eavesdrop.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.084
If you'd just give me
that file, I'd...

07:01.555 --> 07:05.491
You fill out one of these
pink Y473s and you take this
to security.

07:05.559 --> 07:06.890
It's the same guy!

07:07.194 --> 07:09.594
Ms. Jones, thank you.
You may have just helped me
find a kidnapper.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.790
Mr. Magnum,
please, I...

07:11.865 --> 07:16.325
Oh, about Ray,
as usual,
everything will be okay.

07:16.403 --> 07:17.392
Bye.

07:17.471 --> 07:18.631
Bye.

07:22.676 --> 07:23.665
Next!

07:37.491 --> 07:40.289
<i>Goal by Nigel Hucksby III</i>
<i>from Maui.</i>

07:40.794 --> 07:44.389
<i>Final score, Maui: 4,</i>
<i>- 3.</i>

07:44.631 --> 07:48.567
<i>There will be an hour's break</i>
<i>before the next match</i>
<i>between Fort Shafter...</i>

08:09.122 --> 08:11.784
We took it
to the final gun,
Cornwallis.

08:12.059 --> 08:14.357
We've no reason
to feel ashamed.

08:15.128 --> 08:17.221
They played the white team.
We played the white team.

08:17.297 --> 08:18.730
Those were nice passes.

08:56.303 --> 08:57.531
Magnum?

08:58.805 --> 08:59.794
Higgins.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.568
What are you doing
with Mr. Masters' binoculars?

09:01.642 --> 09:03.473
They're not Robin's,
they're T.C.'s.

09:03.544 --> 09:06.342
And do you mind?
I'm staking out
little Allison's kidnapper.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.005
You know who...

09:19.192 --> 09:21.387
You know
who the kidnapper is?

09:29.336 --> 09:31.065
Now see what you've done?

09:31.305 --> 09:35.264
That's not
little Allison's kidnapper.
That's Nigel Hucksby III.

10:08.742 --> 10:09.766
Now where is she, Nigel?

10:09.843 --> 10:11.310
What have you done
with little Allison?

10:12.512 --> 10:13.672
Little Allison?

10:15.048 --> 10:17.482
She is mature
for her age.

10:26.693 --> 10:29.992
I wish Robin had told me
that it was little Allison

10:30.063 --> 10:33.123
who kidnapped Nigel
and not the other way around.

10:37.070 --> 10:40.767
Thanks so much
for rescuing little Allison,
Mr. Magnum.

10:40.841 --> 10:41.899
Don't mention it.

10:41.975 --> 10:46.810
And, Jonathan, please tell
Robin how grateful I am
for everything.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.807
Of course,
Mrs. Thurston.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.315
Let's go, Allison.

10:50.617 --> 10:54.018
Oh, Thomas has said
that I can live here
with him.

10:54.087 --> 10:56.055
What? No...

10:56.757 --> 10:59.282
No, I never said
anything like that,
Allison.

10:59.393 --> 11:01.520
Little Allison shouldn't be
telling her mother stories.

11:01.595 --> 11:05.156
Magnum, really.
You shouldn't say things
a child can misinterpret.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.790
And Jonathan has offered
to take me to Europe.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.167
Jonathan?

11:11.672 --> 11:13.299
I never said...

11:13.807 --> 11:15.297
Now, Allison.

11:15.375 --> 11:16.569
Bye-bye, boys.

11:20.213 --> 11:23.808
The next time Robin calls
about a little girl lost,

11:24.451 --> 11:26.282
I want current photographs.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.249
Quite.

11:29.656 --> 11:31.146
Oh, I almost forgot.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.691
T.C.'s been calling
the main house.

11:32.759 --> 11:35.387
He insists that you return
his binoculars today.

11:35.462 --> 11:36.827
Binoculars?

11:37.464 --> 11:41.958
Oh, I'm in no condition now
to do anything but sleep.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.799
If he calls again,
tell him I'm recuperating.

12:13.033 --> 12:16.833
There are exceptional
situations, I suppose,
where that can be debated.

12:17.437 --> 12:19.029
Perhaps even refuted.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.830
I understand that
Thomas Magnum lives here.

12:22.309 --> 12:25.335
I'm afraid
he's in no condition
to receive visitors.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.135
Please...

12:27.514 --> 12:30.108
Just tell him Madeline Jones
wouldn't be here

12:30.317 --> 12:33.013
if it wasn't a matter
of life and death.

12:39.875 --> 12:41.740
Do you think
he'll be much longer?

12:41.811 --> 12:44.245
I'm quite certain
he'll be here any minute.

12:51.053 --> 12:55.149
It's just that
I need to talk to him
as soon as possible.

13:05.234 --> 13:07.498
Isn't that the
Raskilonovich Maneuver?

13:08.204 --> 13:09.296
What?

13:10.139 --> 13:14.473
The Raskilonovich Maneuver,
named after the Russian
grandmaster of the 20s.

13:14.844 --> 13:16.402
Isn't that
what you just did?

13:17.113 --> 13:19.013
Yeah, I guess so.

13:20.149 --> 13:23.744
I saw a diagram of it
once in a book
in my dentist's office.

13:24.520 --> 13:28.320
The Raskilonovich Maneuver
is one of the most complicated
chess moves ever developed

13:28.390 --> 13:32.486
and you picked it up
by just leafing through a book
in your dentist's office?

13:33.929 --> 13:35.260
Higgins.
- Mr. Magnum.

13:35.331 --> 13:36.491
Magnum, wait.

13:37.133 --> 13:38.122
Higgins.

13:38.300 --> 13:39.392
Just a moment,
Magnum.

13:39.468 --> 13:41.095
Would you consider
showing me that again?

13:41.170 --> 13:42.728
You tricked me!

13:42.805 --> 13:45.171
Magnum, please.
This is the opportunity
of a lifetime.

13:45.241 --> 13:49.234
You gave me a phony name
just to get me over here.

13:49.311 --> 13:51.245
Your name isn't
Madeline Jones?

13:52.148 --> 13:55.174
Well, my friends
call me Maddie,
if that's what you mean.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.412
That's not what I mean
and you know it.

13:57.486 --> 13:59.818
You're not Madeline Jones.
You're not Maddie Jones.

13:59.889 --> 14:01.413
You're Ms. Jones.

14:02.825 --> 14:04.725
That's what they call me
at the office.

14:04.794 --> 14:06.022
Where, Higgins,

14:06.095 --> 14:08.825
where she keeps people
standing in line for hours,

14:08.898 --> 14:10.388
takes personal phone calls,

14:10.466 --> 14:13.492
while these same people
are waiting for information.
And then, Higgins,

14:13.569 --> 14:17.835
then she yells at these
same people for trying
to be friendly and polite.

14:17.907 --> 14:18.931
Those people
being you.

14:19.008 --> 14:19.997
Yes.

14:20.075 --> 14:23.203
Be that as it may, she has
reason to believe that her
husband's life is in danger.

14:23.279 --> 14:27.215
She is in need of help,
and beyond all that, she knows
the Raskilonovich Maneuver.

14:27.283 --> 14:28.443
I think you should
listen to her.

14:28.517 --> 14:29.609
The what?

14:29.685 --> 14:32.882
Mr. Magnum,
Ray is missing.

14:33.322 --> 14:34.721
Ray? Missing?

14:34.790 --> 14:36.382
You just talked to him
this morning.

14:36.458 --> 14:40.224
Well, that was the first time
I had heard from him
in two weeks.

14:40.729 --> 14:41.718
We...

14:42.565 --> 14:46.433
Yeah, but still.
I mean, if he called you,
that means he's all right.

14:46.602 --> 14:49.162
No, because, see,
the only reason
he called me

14:49.238 --> 14:50.899
was to tell me
to stop looking for him.

14:50.973 --> 14:54.101
I think he was afraid
that I was going to get hurt.

14:54.176 --> 14:58.772
Yesterday, these two men
broke into our house and
they turned it upside down.

14:59.348 --> 15:02.078
Now, I know he's
in some kind of trouble.

15:02.184 --> 15:04.982
And I'm going to need help
in finding him.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.144
But...

15:08.624 --> 15:09.613
But...

15:12.862 --> 15:14.420
Why me?

15:15.431 --> 15:19.663
I mean, there must be other
private investigators who come
to you for information.

15:19.735 --> 15:21.532
Why don't you call
one of them?

15:21.604 --> 15:23.595
You're the best
of a bad lot.

15:24.607 --> 15:26.939
And if you don't help me...

15:27.009 --> 15:29.102
I don't know what I'll do.

15:33.315 --> 15:34.304
Magnum.

15:45.427 --> 15:47.156
Where did you last see him?

15:51.800 --> 15:54.325
Ray usually doesn't leave
very much behind
when he goes.

15:54.403 --> 15:56.633
You make it sound
like it happens
on a regular basis.

15:57.473 --> 15:58.667
After our first divorce,

15:58.741 --> 16:01.710
Ray and I agreed
on a non-binding marital
renewal agreement.

16:01.777 --> 16:04.041
Non-binding? What...
Never mind.

16:04.113 --> 16:06.809
It's actually a very
liberated concept.

16:06.916 --> 16:10.750
My relationship with Ray
is unencumbered
by barbaric rituals

16:10.819 --> 16:14.152
and ceremonies
designed to keep one
of the partners enslaved.

16:15.758 --> 16:17.419
Our first wedding.

16:18.894 --> 16:21.362
"Planned Application
Mechanisms

16:21.764 --> 16:25.461
"and Their Utilization
in Resolving Goal Conflicts
in Infinite Loops"?

16:25.567 --> 16:26.625
Artificial intelligence.

16:26.702 --> 16:29.000
It was... Well,
it is Ray's passion.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.005
Programming computers
to think like humans.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.165
Basically.

16:32.274 --> 16:36.233
You see, Ray believes
that Al, that's artificial
intelligence,

16:36.745 --> 16:38.940
can be mankind's
next great step forward.

16:39.014 --> 16:42.575
And I think that if anyone
can make the breakthrough,
my Ray can.

16:42.918 --> 16:44.715
This is what he does
for a living.

16:44.787 --> 16:46.914
No. He's a computer
programmer.

16:46.989 --> 16:48.616
But he spends
all of his spare time
on this.

16:48.691 --> 16:49.715
And someday...

16:49.792 --> 16:51.657
Does he have any friends
or hobbies?

16:51.727 --> 16:53.058
Well, no friends really.

16:53.128 --> 16:57.326
Oh. Recently he developed
an interest in firearms.

16:57.399 --> 16:58.991
He even purchased
a hand gun.

16:59.068 --> 17:01.662
He said it relaxed him
to go to the target range.

17:01.737 --> 17:05.638
Now, I can't just help
but wonder if maybe he wasn't
worried about his own safety.

17:05.708 --> 17:06.766
May I keep these?

17:06.842 --> 17:08.502
Yes. But don't lose them,
please.

17:09.411 --> 17:10.844
Who did he write
programs for?

17:10.913 --> 17:13.108
Uh, retail outlets.
Big corporations.

17:13.281 --> 17:16.012
He has a small
but prestigious clientele.

17:17.219 --> 17:21.484
Do you think that those guys
who were looking for him
were maybe unhappy customers?

17:21.557 --> 17:24.685
No, I don't think so.
But it's a place to start.

17:25.928 --> 17:27.724
His billing printout.

17:28.931 --> 17:30.023
This isn't right.

17:30.099 --> 17:31.225
What?

17:31.300 --> 17:33.632
This name and address.
It's never been
on this printout before.

17:33.702 --> 17:36.068
How can you tell that?
There's gotta be
50 names there.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.072
I would remember
something like this.

17:38.140 --> 17:39.505
What, this one?
Yeah.

17:39.575 --> 17:40.633
"Mark Phelps."

17:40.709 --> 17:43.803
"U.S. Mail, 117 King Street,
Cable P.S. Help."

17:43.879 --> 17:45.870
That's a downtown
post office branch.

17:45.948 --> 17:48.610
But, you see, if Ray
had gotten a big account
like the post office,

17:48.684 --> 17:50.049
I would have been
the very first one
to know about it.

17:50.119 --> 17:53.282
I wouldn't think
a post office would have
a cable address.

17:53.555 --> 17:55.079
So what do we do now?

17:55.190 --> 17:57.624
Well, we go down there
and we ask a few questions.

17:57.693 --> 18:00.890
It's after 9:00.
And if anybody is
still working there,

18:00.963 --> 18:03.431
do you really think
that somebody's going
to let us in.

18:03.799 --> 18:07.667
Hey. That's why you hired
a private investigator.
I'll get us in.

18:07.736 --> 18:10.796
And we will not leave
until I get some answers.

18:35.898 --> 18:36.922
How are you?

18:36.999 --> 18:38.091
Come here.

19:05.527 --> 19:07.757
This is
absolutely incredible.

19:08.097 --> 19:10.031
Incredible?
It's embarrassing.

19:10.332 --> 19:12.095
Have you ever seen anything
like this before?

19:12.167 --> 19:14.533
No! Now come on.
Let's get out of here.

19:16.972 --> 19:18.371
Excuse me.

19:22.578 --> 19:23.670
Excuse me.

19:26.482 --> 19:27.471
We can't leave yet.

19:27.549 --> 19:28.846
Why not?

19:29.284 --> 19:30.842
Because you haven't
talked to the manager,

19:30.919 --> 19:33.615
and he might be able
to give us some information
on Mark Phelps.

19:33.689 --> 19:36.624
All right. Two more minutes.
But if he doesn't show up,
I'm leaving.

19:45.367 --> 19:46.493
<i>Thank you.</i>

19:46.568 --> 19:48.695
<i>And now, for something</i>
<i>completely different.</i>

19:49.671 --> 19:52.606
<i>The U.S. Male Revue</i>
<i>is proud to present</i>

19:52.875 --> 19:54.536
<i>the postal care</i>
<i>of your dreams.</i>

19:54.610 --> 19:58.205
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>a nice round of applause.</i>
<i>Mandy, the lady mailman.</i>

20:11.527 --> 20:13.461
On the other hand,
we could always reach him
on the phone.

20:13.529 --> 20:15.622
There really isn't any point
in hanging around here.

20:15.697 --> 20:18.393
No. Wait a minute.
I mean, you're right.
Why be hasty?

20:24.106 --> 20:26.836
Excuse me.
I'm Paul Scott,
the manager here.

20:27.042 --> 20:28.771
And I understand
you've been asking about me.

20:28.844 --> 20:31.904
Yes, I'm Thomas Magnum,
and this is Ms. Jones.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.379
Hello.
How do you do?

20:33.448 --> 20:37.384
Oh, we were supposed
to deliver a computer
to a Mark Phelps.

20:37.452 --> 20:39.943
But the address
on the invoice is here.

20:40.255 --> 20:43.247
The model XJ9-7000.
With attachments.

20:43.458 --> 20:46.859
Yeah. So we were
just wondering if
you'd seen him here.

20:46.929 --> 20:49.159
Does this look like the place
where you'd buy a computer?

20:50.699 --> 20:51.723
You don't know him?

20:51.800 --> 20:52.824
No, I don't.

20:52.901 --> 20:55.301
Tony, give these folks
their last drink.

20:55.370 --> 20:56.598
On the house.

20:56.672 --> 20:57.696
Enjoy.

20:57.773 --> 20:58.831
Oh, thank you.

20:59.575 --> 21:00.803
Now what?

21:00.876 --> 21:02.605
I'm thinking.
I'm thinking.

21:02.678 --> 21:03.736
I don't believe it.

21:03.812 --> 21:05.177
Oh, I am.
I'm thinking.

21:05.247 --> 21:07.442
Karen Summers with Ray!

21:08.350 --> 21:09.681
Ray Jones!

21:13.522 --> 21:14.921
Wait a minute.

21:17.392 --> 21:18.916
Wait a minute.

21:41.316 --> 21:42.374
You lost him.

21:47.022 --> 21:48.956
No wonder he told me
to quit looking for him.

21:49.958 --> 21:53.689
Look, I don't think
he's having an affair
with Karen Summers.

21:54.563 --> 21:57.031
Then why else
would they have
been there together?

21:58.133 --> 22:02.092
Well, maybe they...
Maybe they weren't
there together.

22:02.170 --> 22:05.867
I mean, maybe,
coincidentally,
he sat down at her table

22:06.174 --> 22:10.770
and then she slipped away
because she was embarrassed
for you to see her there.

22:12.047 --> 22:13.071
You think so?

22:13.148 --> 22:15.048
Well, it's certainly
very possible.

22:15.450 --> 22:18.419
And besides,
if he was cheating
on you, I mean,

22:18.487 --> 22:21.456
why would two guys
rip up your house
looking for him?

22:21.857 --> 22:22.846
That's true.

22:22.924 --> 22:23.948
Yes, of course it's true.

22:24.026 --> 22:25.755
And then why this sudden
interest in guns,

22:25.827 --> 22:27.522
unless he was worried
about protecting himself?

22:27.596 --> 22:28.893
I think
you're right.

22:28.964 --> 22:30.329
He is in some kind
of jeopardy.

22:30.399 --> 22:31.388
Possibly life-threatening.

22:31.466 --> 22:34.958
And he ran away from us
because we were about ready
to expose him.

22:35.037 --> 22:36.061
Exactly.

22:36.138 --> 22:37.730
Thank you,
Mr. Magnum.

22:38.206 --> 22:39.639
I feel much better.

22:39.708 --> 22:42.176
Listen, as long as
we're going to be
spending some time together,

22:42.244 --> 22:43.973
could you
call me Thomas?

22:44.146 --> 22:46.137
All right, Thomas.

22:47.249 --> 22:49.376
And you can call me...

22:49.651 --> 22:50.777
Maddie?

22:51.153 --> 22:52.381
Madeline.

22:52.487 --> 22:53.476
Madeline.

22:54.256 --> 22:55.382
Oh, all right.

22:55.457 --> 22:57.516
Now, for now, Madeline,

22:58.927 --> 23:03.193
I think it would be safer
for you and Ray if you stayed
out of sight for a while.

23:03.265 --> 23:04.698
I'm going to move you
to the estate.

23:04.933 --> 23:06.332
Really?
Yes.

23:06.401 --> 23:10.804
And I know that Higgins
would be happy to keep an eye
on you until I find Ray.

23:14.309 --> 23:16.038
<i>I'm afraid</i>
<i>it's out of the question.</i>

23:18.213 --> 23:20.909
Come on, Higgins!
I already promised her!

23:21.550 --> 23:23.916
Then I guess you'll have
to un-promise her.

23:23.985 --> 23:26.920
Kenji and I have 14 trees
to trim today

23:27.022 --> 23:29.547
and I have tickets tonight
for the symphony.

23:30.392 --> 23:33.623
You shouldn't be climbing
around in trees, anyway.

23:33.729 --> 23:35.594
It could be dangerous.

23:36.898 --> 23:37.990
Come on, Higgins.

23:38.066 --> 23:40.728
Don't you even care
there are people
following her around?

23:40.802 --> 23:42.599
Her life could
be in danger.

23:42.804 --> 23:44.431
Of course I care.

23:45.040 --> 23:46.871
That's why I think
you should call the police.

23:47.476 --> 23:51.412
She promised she'd show you
the trick to the
Raskekvikjack Maneuver.

23:52.948 --> 23:54.210
Higgins?

24:00.889 --> 24:02.254
Hey, Thomas.

24:02.791 --> 24:04.554
Today is your lucky day,
my friend.

24:04.626 --> 24:08.585
Found out that Ray Jones
is a member of the exclusive
Pu Laipala Gun Club.

24:08.797 --> 24:09.957
As a matter of fact,

24:10.031 --> 24:12.499
the manager told me
he's been around there
for the last couple of days.

24:12.567 --> 24:13.556
Yeah?

24:13.635 --> 24:15.466
Now guess who else
is a member.

24:15.537 --> 24:17.198
Mark Phelps.
Remember him?

24:17.272 --> 24:19.467
The guy you were looking for
at that strip joint.

24:19.541 --> 24:22.408
Well, anyway, I got you
a temporary membership card.

24:24.312 --> 24:25.609
That's great.
Thanks, Rick.

24:25.680 --> 24:26.840
Not so fast.

24:27.315 --> 24:30.876
You see, I promised T.C.
That I wouldn't leave here
without his binoculars.

24:30.952 --> 24:33.420
We got tickets
on the 50 yard line
at the Aloha Bowl.

24:33.488 --> 24:34.887
The binoculars?
No problem.

24:34.956 --> 24:37.754
Very well, Magnum,
you win.

24:38.326 --> 24:41.955
I shall inform Kenji
the trees can wait
until another day.

24:42.230 --> 24:43.891
And as for the symphony,

24:44.166 --> 24:46.760
what is Rachmaninoff
compared to Raskilonovich?

24:46.835 --> 24:47.927
Thanks, Higgins.

24:48.003 --> 24:49.265
When will she arrive?

24:49.337 --> 24:50.361
She's in the study now.

24:50.439 --> 24:51.997
I knew you wouldn't say no!

24:52.073 --> 24:53.802
Hey, what about
the binoculars?

24:53.875 --> 24:55.604
I'll take care of it.

25:03.385 --> 25:04.511
Thomas!

25:10.926 --> 25:14.726
<i>You're probably</i>
<i>wondering why I wasn't</i>
<i>going to the police.</i>

25:14.830 --> 25:18.322
<i>Well, it has to do</i>
<i>with my great Aunt Phoebe</i>

25:18.834 --> 25:22.133
<i>who wrote short stories</i>
<i>for magazines in the 1920s.</i>

25:22.404 --> 25:25.168
<i>She lived alone in New York,</i>
<i>worked hard, partied hard</i>

25:25.240 --> 25:28.403
<i>and had lunch</i>
<i>more than once</i>
<i>at the Algonquin Round Table.</i>

25:28.810 --> 25:31.472
<i>And when she wasn't</i>
<i>writing stories,</i>

25:31.580 --> 25:34.242
<i>she was seeing them</i>
<i>in her own life.</i>

25:34.549 --> 25:36.517
<i>Danger lurked</i>
<i>around every corner.</i>

25:36.585 --> 25:38.644
<i>And the simplest action</i>
<i>by any of her friends</i>

25:38.720 --> 25:42.383
<i>could be construed</i>
<i>as a cover for something</i>
<i>much more sinister.</i>

25:42.624 --> 25:47.584
<i>Now, I'm not saying Ms. Jones</i>
<i>had an imagination in the</i>
<i>league with my Aunt Phoebe,</i>

25:47.662 --> 25:51.530
<i>but before I called</i>
<i>the police, I had to find out.</i>

25:54.469 --> 25:55.834
Good morning,
Mr. Jones.

25:55.904 --> 25:57.531
Take number five.

26:02.878 --> 26:04.778
New targets are
to the left.

26:04.946 --> 26:06.538
Take number 10.

26:09.284 --> 26:12.310
<i>I figured</i>
<i>the best thing to do</i>
<i>was keep an eye on Ray</i>

26:12.387 --> 26:15.550
<i>until he left the club</i>
<i>and talked to him outside</i>
<i>where it was quiet</i>

26:16.157 --> 26:18.751
<i>and where he didn't have</i>
<i>a gun in his hand.</i>

26:41.116 --> 26:42.845
MAN ON P. A:
<i>Target line is clear.</i>

26:49.291 --> 26:51.122
<i>Lock and load.</i>

26:54.996 --> 26:56.896
<i>You may commence fire.</i>

27:59.660 --> 28:01.252
Extraordinary.

28:01.528 --> 28:02.586
In the last two hours,

28:02.663 --> 28:06.121
you've employed
five of the most
difficult maneuvers known,

28:06.200 --> 28:08.600
in a game which you say
you've never played.

28:08.669 --> 28:12.503
I've always had
an ability to recall
complex configurations.

28:13.307 --> 28:14.934
I wonder where Thomas is.

28:15.008 --> 28:17.568
He promised he'd call by noon
even if he had no news.

28:17.644 --> 28:21.580
You'll discover that
Magnum's memory is not
as infallible as yours.

28:21.982 --> 28:24.177
I guess no news is good news.

28:24.418 --> 28:28.013
Speaking selfishly,
I've enjoyed our
uninterrupted time together.

28:28.188 --> 28:30.383
It's not often one has
the opportunity to be
in the presence

28:30.457 --> 28:32.687
of such
a perspicacious mind.

28:33.393 --> 28:35.987
Most people don't find me
very interesting.

28:36.864 --> 28:41.631
Ever since I can remember,
I was always considered
aloof and strange,

28:42.135 --> 28:43.568
a know-it-all.

28:44.004 --> 28:46.131
I've always felt
unliked and...

28:47.641 --> 28:48.801
Alone?

28:50.244 --> 28:51.541
How did you know?

28:54.381 --> 28:57.316
Anyway, that all changed
when I met Ray.

28:57.451 --> 28:58.611
Madeline?

29:00.053 --> 29:01.315
Thomas.

29:01.722 --> 29:03.986
I was wondering
why you hadn't called.

29:04.258 --> 29:06.317
Madeline, this is
Lieutenant Tanaka.

29:06.393 --> 29:07.587
Oh, no.

29:07.761 --> 29:09.422
I knew it was
something like this.

29:09.496 --> 29:10.656
Ray's in jail.

29:10.764 --> 29:11.788
No.

29:13.100 --> 29:14.499
In protective custody?

29:14.568 --> 29:15.796
Madeline.

29:19.439 --> 29:23.068
Ray was killed by a sniper
at the gun club this morning.

29:26.680 --> 29:27.840
I...

29:29.716 --> 29:31.445
I was there, but...

29:33.854 --> 29:35.116
I'm sorry.

29:39.426 --> 29:43.760
I'm afraid I'm going to
have to ask you to come down
for an identification.

29:58.912 --> 30:00.311
This isn't my husband.

30:00.881 --> 30:01.973
What?

30:02.182 --> 30:04.810
There is
a striking resemblance,
but this isn't Ray.

30:07.354 --> 30:08.912
Madeline,
these things can be tough...

30:08.989 --> 30:11.423
Thomas, this isn't him.

30:11.491 --> 30:13.550
You barely glanced at him.
How can you be so sure?

30:13.627 --> 30:15.527
I just am.
How?

30:15.595 --> 30:17.961
This isn't the place
to talk about it.

30:22.002 --> 30:24.095
A leopard tattoo?

30:25.038 --> 30:27.472
The artist guaranteed
that it was one of a kind.

30:27.541 --> 30:29.372
On the arch
of his left foot.
But why?

30:29.443 --> 30:30.671
I mean,
who would see it?

30:30.744 --> 30:31.733
I would.

30:31.845 --> 30:34.507
I happen to find tattoos
very sensuous.

30:37.384 --> 30:39.852
Ray had it done
as a surprise for me.

30:42.022 --> 30:43.387
Where do we go from here?

30:43.890 --> 30:47.326
Well, there's nothing much
left to do except go back
to the estate,

30:47.394 --> 30:50.852
go over all our notes
and see if we can come up with
a new lead on Mark Phelps.

30:50.931 --> 30:52.296
And what if we don't
come up with one?

30:52.366 --> 30:53.958
I will.

30:56.036 --> 30:57.401
I will.

30:59.706 --> 31:01.833
Oh, I don't know.
What do you think?

31:01.908 --> 31:05.400
Well, it's just a matter
of looking over the clues
one more...

31:05.979 --> 31:07.276
T.C.

31:07.848 --> 31:09.145
What are you
doing here?

31:09.216 --> 31:11.776
No, no.
Now, wait a minute,
don't tell me.

31:12.019 --> 31:14.749
Higgins let you in
to get the binoculars.

31:14.855 --> 31:15.879
Yeah.

31:15.956 --> 31:17.617
After you pay
your buddy's bill.

31:17.691 --> 31:18.715
What are you talking about?

31:18.792 --> 31:20.384
Don't play innocent
with me, Magnum.

31:20.460 --> 31:22.325
I just flew your friend
Mark Phelps

31:22.396 --> 31:25.024
to Galletin International
on the North Shore.

31:25.766 --> 31:26.790
Mark Phelps?

31:26.867 --> 31:27.925
Galletin International?

31:28.001 --> 31:32.028
And he said to give you
the bill.

31:33.940 --> 31:35.567
Now pay up.

31:35.642 --> 31:37.007
I don't believe it.

31:37.077 --> 31:39.136
You said we'd
come up with a lead
and we did.

31:39.212 --> 31:41.840
Yeah. But doesn't it
strike you as being
a little too easy?

31:41.915 --> 31:43.143
What?
What do you mean?

31:43.216 --> 31:45.013
Is this the guy
you flew up there?

31:45.485 --> 31:46.713
Yeah, you know it's him.

31:46.787 --> 31:47.776
Mark Phelps.

31:47.854 --> 31:48.878
No, Ray Jones.

31:48.955 --> 31:49.979
Who?

31:50.057 --> 31:52.992
Oh, well, Ray was doing
some classified work
for Galletin.

31:53.060 --> 31:54.550
An experimental computer.

31:54.628 --> 31:56.619
But why would he go
to so much trouble
to lead us up there?

31:56.696 --> 31:58.129
I don't know,
but I'm going
to find out.

31:58.198 --> 31:59.665
I'm going with you.
No! No!

31:59.733 --> 32:01.166
Now, we have
been through this.

32:01.234 --> 32:02.531
It's safer for you here.

32:02.602 --> 32:04.331
You don't know
how to work that computer.

32:04.404 --> 32:07.464
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Could we discuss payment?

32:08.608 --> 32:10.269
I'll pay. Gladly.

32:14.915 --> 32:16.280
My name is T.C.

32:16.483 --> 32:19.077
Oh, I'm sorry, T.C.,
this is Madeline Jones.

32:19.152 --> 32:21.177
Madeline, this is
my friend T.C.

32:21.321 --> 32:22.549
How do you do?

32:22.656 --> 32:23.680
Fine.

32:23.757 --> 32:24.746
Well?

32:24.825 --> 32:26.156
Oh, fine.

32:26.226 --> 32:27.284
Let's go.
Thanks, T.C.

32:27.360 --> 32:28.349
Okay.

32:28.428 --> 32:31.329
Oh, oh, oh,
about my binoculars.

32:32.399 --> 32:34.196
The binoculars.
Yes.

32:34.267 --> 32:36.963
Oh! I almost forgot.
I've got them right here
in the drawer.

32:38.338 --> 32:39.430
See?

32:39.506 --> 32:41.736
And you thought I'd leave
without giving them to you.

32:41.808 --> 32:43.503
No, no, no.
No, I didn't.

32:55.355 --> 32:56.481
Oh!

33:03.130 --> 33:04.222
Thomas!

33:06.566 --> 33:09.091
We did it.
You were right.

33:09.169 --> 33:10.636
They're much more relaxed
on the weekends.

33:10.704 --> 33:12.171
Well, let's not count
on our luck holding.

33:12.239 --> 33:13.365
Any of these
look familiar?

33:13.440 --> 33:15.908
Oh, this one over here.

33:17.110 --> 33:19.510
It's an experimental model
two years from production.

33:21.414 --> 33:25.282
Fortunately, Ray fed me
the program information
one night during dinner.

33:25.719 --> 33:26.913
It's very sexy data.

33:26.987 --> 33:28.011
Sexy?

33:28.088 --> 33:29.385
You'd have to know Ray.

33:29.456 --> 33:31.720
Oh, I hope he didn't change
the access code.

33:38.598 --> 33:40.964
I should've known
he wouldn't change it.

33:41.635 --> 33:43.102
Well, I'm in.

33:43.203 --> 33:44.568
I'll see what I can find.

33:44.638 --> 33:46.401
Do you think you could
hurry it up just a little?

33:46.473 --> 33:48.236
If they decide to come in
and check on us...

33:48.308 --> 33:50.105
I'm hurrying.
I'm hurrying.

33:50.210 --> 33:51.700
This is very odd.

33:51.778 --> 33:53.245
What?
Look.

33:53.547 --> 33:57.074
"Mark Phelps, U.S. Mail,
117 King Street.
Cable P.S. Help."

33:57.250 --> 33:58.911
The same thing that was
on the billing printout.

33:58.985 --> 34:00.282
What do you
think that means?

34:00.353 --> 34:01.843
I think it's a code.

34:02.556 --> 34:03.716
Oh, my.

34:03.890 --> 34:05.118
Look at this.

34:05.225 --> 34:06.214
What?

34:06.326 --> 34:09.022
It's most impressive
artificial intelligence
research data.

34:09.094 --> 34:10.652
This is magnificent.

34:15.235 --> 34:17.362
Why would he keep all of this
hidden away on this computer?

34:17.437 --> 34:19.871
I'm the only one
who knows his access code.

34:19.940 --> 34:23.501
Maybe you're the only one
he trusts to get it out.

34:23.710 --> 34:24.802
We appreciate it.

34:24.878 --> 34:26.368
We'll take it now.

34:28.315 --> 34:29.543
Hi!

34:30.717 --> 34:31.978
We were just...

34:34.521 --> 34:35.545
I can explain everything.

34:35.621 --> 34:37.351
Thomas...

34:37.424 --> 34:39.619
What? I mean, we were
just getting some stuff
for a friend.

34:39.693 --> 34:42.685
Thomas, they're the men
who broke into my house.

34:42.762 --> 34:44.252
Oh, no.
No, Madeline.

34:44.331 --> 34:47.527
I mean, these people
are obviously
with security here.

34:47.833 --> 34:48.858
Run!

34:48.935 --> 34:50.061
Hold it.

34:51.404 --> 34:52.928
Nobody goes anywhere.

34:53.340 --> 34:55.137
That paper belongs
to Mark Phelps.

34:55.208 --> 34:56.800
I'm afraid not.

34:57.510 --> 35:00.604
You're all under arrest
for conspiracy against
the US Government.

35:00.680 --> 35:02.238
Hello, Magnum.

35:02.782 --> 35:05.114
I believe you've met
Agent Summers.

35:12.741 --> 35:14.936
Well, I've got to
hand it to you, Magnum.

35:15.010 --> 35:16.272
You've done it again.

35:16.345 --> 35:18.438
You've given us
a big, fat zero.

35:18.647 --> 35:20.274
Colonel,
our information was...

35:20.349 --> 35:23.011
Worthless, Lieutenant.
Worthless.

35:24.019 --> 35:26.647
What you tracked down
was a very clever formula

35:26.722 --> 35:29.555
designed to make us think
it was the genuine item.

35:30.092 --> 35:33.960
But the truth is,
it's about as valuable
as a Susan B. Anthony dollar.

35:34.062 --> 35:35.427
Sir...
What?

35:37.666 --> 35:38.758
Yes, sir.

35:38.834 --> 35:40.859
I should've known
she was a spy.

35:41.270 --> 35:43.397
What do you know
about Ray Jones?

35:44.439 --> 35:47.772
Just that he's missing
and his wife hired me
to find him.

35:47.843 --> 35:50.505
And who told you to go
to Galletin International?

35:50.579 --> 35:51.807
Just a hunch.

35:51.880 --> 35:54.747
Get off the case, Magnum.
You're getting in our way.

35:55.284 --> 35:56.342
Oh, come on, Buck.

35:56.418 --> 35:59.945
You know I can't stop
investigating just 'cause
you ask me to.

36:00.322 --> 36:03.018
Now, if there was
a real good reason.

36:03.225 --> 36:04.692
You want
a real good reason?

36:04.760 --> 36:07.194
How about you were picked up
after illegally entering

36:07.262 --> 36:08.786
a government
contract facility?

36:08.864 --> 36:09.853
Come on.

36:09.932 --> 36:12.423
If you were gonna hold us
on that, you would've
charged us by now.

36:12.501 --> 36:14.901
I mean, you already let
the other guys go.

36:18.540 --> 36:20.269
Well, I think we should
get back to work.

36:21.710 --> 36:22.870
Sir!

36:22.945 --> 36:24.606
Slow down,
Magnum.

36:30.953 --> 36:35.583
Ray Jones was doing
some freelance work for us
on artificial intelligence.

36:37.526 --> 36:39.153
He was onto something special

36:39.227 --> 36:41.593
when apparently he was
approached by an agent

36:41.863 --> 36:44.354
who wanted to buy it
for the Eastern Bloc.

36:44.866 --> 36:46.026
Mark Phelps.

36:46.234 --> 36:48.634
Unfortunately, Ray Jones
went into hiding

36:48.704 --> 36:51.434
before he could give us
the information or them.

36:51.540 --> 36:53.770
We found a look-a-like
to try to draw Phelps out.

36:53.842 --> 36:56.902
But you two kept showing up
and getting in the way.

36:57.579 --> 36:59.513
So your guys
and Mark Phelps' guys

36:59.581 --> 37:01.640
are just going to keep
bumping each other off

37:01.717 --> 37:04.277
in the race to find Ray
or the formula.

37:04.353 --> 37:06.082
That's a little simplistic.

37:06.254 --> 37:10.020
On the other hand, I'd hate
for the two of you to
get caught in any crossfire.

37:10.092 --> 37:12.720
So, I'm asking you
to get off the case.

37:14.329 --> 37:16.820
Well, I'm afraid
I can't do that.

37:16.898 --> 37:18.593
But thanks
for the information.

37:18.667 --> 37:22.831
Oh, and, Karen,
I'm sorry that we led you
to the wrong formula,

37:22.904 --> 37:24.667
but it happens
sometimes.

37:25.574 --> 37:26.598
Damn it,
Magnum.

37:26.675 --> 37:29.405
Why'd I tell you all this
if you're going to keep on
looking for him?

37:30.078 --> 37:31.773
Beats the hell
out of me.

37:35.851 --> 37:38.217
He makes me so mad,
I could just scream.

37:38.687 --> 37:40.655
The unmitigated gall
of that man

37:40.722 --> 37:42.690
to suggest that my Ray
could even think

37:42.758 --> 37:44.783
of selling military secrets
to the enemy.

37:44.860 --> 37:48.296
Well, he certainly
had enough time,
if that was his plan.

37:48.463 --> 37:53.196
When this is all over,
I am going to file a formal
complaint with John W. Vessey.

37:53.335 --> 37:57.704
You know, I think he took us
and them to that phony formula
on purpose.

37:57.773 --> 37:58.899
But why?

37:58.974 --> 38:02.774
While I'm at it,
I am going to send duplicates
to the other Chiefs of Staff,

38:02.844 --> 38:05.335
General James D. Watkins,
General Paul X. Kelley,

38:05.414 --> 38:07.882
General Charles A. Gabriel
and General John A. Wickham.

38:07.949 --> 38:12.215
Wait a minute.
Now, how do you know the names
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff?

38:13.088 --> 38:15.488
Colonel Green had
a citation in his office.
They'd all signed it.

38:15.557 --> 38:18.082
When I get through
with that man,
he is going to be so sorry

38:18.160 --> 38:20.094
he ever hung
that citation
in his office.

38:20.162 --> 38:21.424
Madeline...

38:22.297 --> 38:25.494
Did you ever memorize
anything for Ray?

38:26.334 --> 38:28.131
Sure, all the time. Why?

38:28.670 --> 38:30.535
I think I have a plan.

38:32.941 --> 38:34.431
Seven...

38:35.143 --> 38:36.405
Six...

38:37.646 --> 38:38.806
Five...

38:39.181 --> 38:41.513
Your body is quite
relaxed now.

38:42.617 --> 38:44.175
Four...

38:45.387 --> 38:46.752
Three...

38:48.023 --> 38:49.320
Two...

38:51.026 --> 38:53.460
You can barely
keep your eyes open.

38:58.900 --> 39:00.424
It's working.

39:01.536 --> 39:03.436
The relaxation is complete.

39:05.540 --> 39:07.474
I knew you could...

39:09.044 --> 39:10.306
I'm sorry.

39:12.547 --> 39:16.779
Ask her to tell you
everything she knows
about Mark Phelps.

39:19.921 --> 39:23.755
You are going to search
your memory
for the name Mark Phelps.

39:23.892 --> 39:27.089
Do not censor anything,
no matter how trivial.

39:28.396 --> 39:30.330
Mark Phelps...

39:31.566 --> 39:32.931
Mark Phelps...

39:34.069 --> 39:38.472
A... Prompt...
Two triangle...

39:38.673 --> 39:42.973
X semicolon...
Little man... A...

39:43.345 --> 39:44.744
This is gibberish.

39:44.946 --> 39:46.174
Perhaps not.

39:46.248 --> 39:50.184
It could be a clever block
to keep her from uncovering
vital information.

39:50.786 --> 39:52.344
Remove the blocks.

39:52.554 --> 39:55.580
Do not censor any thought
that comes into your mind.

39:55.891 --> 39:59.156
U.S. Male Revue...

40:00.896 --> 40:03.922
Great. We've tapped
into her libido.

40:06.067 --> 40:07.864
Paul Scott.

40:09.871 --> 40:12.863
He's the manager
at this male dance place.

40:13.208 --> 40:14.869
P.S. Help.

40:15.343 --> 40:18.335
Phelps. Paul Scott.

40:18.814 --> 40:20.247
This is not going to work.

40:20.315 --> 40:22.146
A equals...

40:22.217 --> 40:25.414
L - Y - C...

40:25.654 --> 40:30.682
Exclamation point...
Dollar sign...
Carriage return...

40:31.827 --> 40:36.321
Phelps. Paul Scott.
P.S. Help.

40:38.200 --> 40:42.136
P.S. Help is
an anagram for Phelps.

40:42.304 --> 40:43.328
It's the key.

40:43.405 --> 40:44.804
P as in Paul.

40:44.873 --> 40:46.101
S as in Scott.

40:46.241 --> 40:48.106
The manager
at the dance place.

40:48.176 --> 40:49.700
Phelps is Paul Scott.

40:49.978 --> 40:51.570
I believe you're right.

40:52.280 --> 40:54.544
Ms. Jones,
wonderful.

40:54.649 --> 40:56.446
Look, when she comes out
of her trance...

40:56.518 --> 40:58.418
She won't remember a thing.

40:58.486 --> 41:02.047
Well, anyway, you just
tell her I think I'm on
the trail of Ray.

41:03.592 --> 41:04.820
Quite.

41:05.760 --> 41:09.628
Now, when I count to five,
you will awaken.

41:11.233 --> 41:12.495
One...

41:27.349 --> 41:28.646
First,

41:30.385 --> 41:33.843
you will search your memory
for diagrams of little-known,

41:34.122 --> 41:36.317
but devastating,
chess maneuvers.

41:36.791 --> 41:40.852
Do not censor anything,
no matter how trivial.

41:49.070 --> 41:50.970
Next. Number 30.

41:57.412 --> 41:58.470
Name of act?

41:58.546 --> 42:00.241
The Emperor Caligula.

42:00.315 --> 42:01.577
Go ahead.

42:04.753 --> 42:07.449
I was getting
a little worried
about you, Jones.

42:07.522 --> 42:08.750
Who, me?

42:09.090 --> 42:12.457
Nah. I just had to make sure
nobody was following me.

42:12.994 --> 42:15.758
It's been a very exciting
couple of days.

42:16.998 --> 42:18.090
Well.

42:21.469 --> 42:23.061
Here's the formula.

42:27.909 --> 42:29.069
Hold it right there.

42:29.144 --> 42:31.009
I have never
seen him before
in my life.

42:31.880 --> 42:33.404
I'll take that.

42:34.049 --> 42:36.017
I guess Madeline was
wrong about you.

42:36.885 --> 42:38.182
Look out!

42:46.294 --> 42:47.386
Get him!

43:19.594 --> 43:22.222
Sorry, much too violent
for what we're looking for.

43:22.297 --> 43:24.026
Thank you. Next.

43:24.165 --> 43:25.757
Thanks a lot, fella.

43:31.239 --> 43:32.797
You warned me. Why?

43:32.974 --> 43:35.238
I wasn't giving them
real information.

43:35.377 --> 43:38.346
I was trying to stall them
until my contact got here.

43:38.847 --> 43:39.939
Your contact?

43:40.015 --> 43:42.449
Unfortunately,
you got in the way.

43:43.485 --> 43:45.851
Gentlemen, get these two
out of here.

43:48.323 --> 43:51.383
Ray called us and told us
he was coming out of hiding.

43:51.793 --> 43:55.752
We wanted to catch him
handing the bogus information
to Phelps.

43:55.830 --> 43:57.923
Well, I think
you're a little late.

43:58.266 --> 43:59.995
Looks like I owe you one.

44:01.503 --> 44:02.731
Well,

44:05.073 --> 44:07.473
here's the real formula,
Colonel Green.

44:07.542 --> 44:08.702
Thank you, Ray.

44:19.554 --> 44:21.613
This is what you've
been working on?

44:21.689 --> 44:23.486
It's all right there.

44:30.498 --> 44:32.125
This is obsolete.

44:32.901 --> 44:34.892
This formula is obsolete.

44:35.603 --> 44:39.972
You're kidding! You mean
we went through all this
for nothing?

44:40.775 --> 44:43.073
I'll see you
back at my office.

44:43.311 --> 44:44.300
Sir.

45:00.528 --> 45:02.155
I wonder where
I went wrong.

45:03.865 --> 45:06.333
Isn't he
the most brilliant man
you've ever met?

45:06.401 --> 45:09.268
I mean,
to outsmart Phelps

45:09.337 --> 45:12.602
and then to leave
the clue to his identity
in my brain

45:12.707 --> 45:14.732
just in case
anything went wrong.

45:14.909 --> 45:16.035
He's such
a genius.

45:16.111 --> 45:18.978
Oh! A genius who came up
with the wrong formula.

45:19.247 --> 45:20.942
Oh, who cares
about that?

45:21.015 --> 45:24.348
Of course, I never
could've found the key
without you, Thomas.

45:24.419 --> 45:25.943
Thank you.

45:26.588 --> 45:28.681
Well, ready to go,
bumblebee?

45:28.756 --> 45:30.519
We don't want to miss
the flight to Kauai.

45:30.592 --> 45:34.426
Oh. We've never had a wedding
at the Fern Grotto before.

45:34.696 --> 45:37.187
Would you mind
taking a picture of us
before we leave?

45:37.265 --> 45:39.165
I think the camera's
right in my car.

45:39.234 --> 45:40.861
I'd be delighted.

45:43.838 --> 45:47.001
Well, that thanks
goes double for me.

45:48.042 --> 45:52.206
I feel a little foolish
putting everyone in jeopardy
over a worthless formula.

45:52.514 --> 45:54.539
Yeah, that wouldn't
have been too smart.

45:55.817 --> 45:56.909
Tell me something,

45:56.985 --> 46:01.547
does the phrase, "A prompt,
two triangle, X semicolon,"
mean anything to you?

46:02.924 --> 46:04.391
Where'd you hear that?

46:04.459 --> 46:07.394
Oh, Madeline kept
repeating it
under hypnosis.

46:08.563 --> 46:11.691
That's part of the formula
that everybody has been
looking for, isn't it?

46:13.134 --> 46:15.432
Why'd you give Buck Green
a phony one?

46:15.703 --> 46:17.500
What makes you
so sure I did?

46:17.572 --> 46:18.561
Ray...

46:23.878 --> 46:25.812
Let me put it
to you this way.

46:26.381 --> 46:30.044
If all men had
were rocks and clubs

46:30.585 --> 46:32.416
and you invented gun powder,

46:33.221 --> 46:35.655
wouldn't you think twice
before giving it to the world?

46:38.426 --> 46:39.415
Yeah.

46:41.262 --> 46:45.562
Well, if I decided
not to give it out, though,

46:45.967 --> 46:49.095
I might be a little worried
about the fact
that my wife knew about it.

46:49.704 --> 46:50.762
Well, we're only saying if.

46:50.838 --> 46:52.100
Oh, of course.

46:52.874 --> 46:55.172
Well, if your wife did know,

46:56.177 --> 46:59.806
you'd probably try to convince
her and everybody else
that she didn't know.

47:00.815 --> 47:02.612
For her own safety.

47:05.887 --> 47:08.412
She's right.
You are very smart.

47:08.756 --> 47:09.848
Ready?

47:20.602 --> 47:22.729
You're not smiling,
cupcake.

47:23.004 --> 47:24.699
Yes, I am, honey bunch.

47:25.306 --> 47:27.069
You're going to ruin
the photograph, dearest.

47:27.141 --> 47:28.904
Don't start in again,
darling.

47:28.977 --> 47:30.035
I'm not starting in.

47:30.111 --> 47:32.545
You always do this
before every wedding.

47:32.647 --> 47:33.636
No, I don't.

47:33.715 --> 47:35.012
Yes, you do. You did it
when we went to Maui.

47:35.083 --> 47:36.072
Oh, I did not.
You always...

47:36.150 --> 47:37.549
Say cheese.

47:38.553 --> 47:39.781
Cheese!
