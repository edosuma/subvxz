WEBVTT

00:51.600 --> 00:53.120
What?

01:03.440 --> 01:05.760
You all right?

01:05.760 --> 01:06.880
Hiya.

01:06.880 --> 01:08.600
You here to see Mr Bedford?

01:08.600 --> 01:10.640
Yeah. Well, sort of.

01:10.640 --> 01:12.360
He's dead. No, I know.

01:12.360 --> 01:13.840
I'm here to, uh...

01:13.840 --> 01:15.840
What?

01:15.840 --> 01:17.920
I'm here to
clean up the blood. What?

01:17.920 --> 01:19.840
I'm here to
clean up his blood!

01:21.360 --> 01:22.600
I'm a crime scene cleaner.

01:22.600 --> 01:25.800
Well, why are you ringing the
doorbell if you know he's dead?

01:25.800 --> 01:27.520
I thought his relatives
might be in, no?

01:27.520 --> 01:29.640
No, he didn't have any.
Just a dog.

01:29.640 --> 01:31.520
Well, here's the thing -

01:31.520 --> 01:34.000
some dogs can open
doors these days.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.240
My mate Daz, he taught his dog
to walk on its hind legs.

01:38.240 --> 01:40.280
In the end, that's
the only way it walked.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.480
It was weird
seeing him round town.

01:42.480 --> 01:44.720
It just looked like
he was hanging out with a hairy kid

01:44.720 --> 01:47.480
that kept shitting on pavements.

01:52.920 --> 01:54.040
Good chat.

01:58.440 --> 02:02.040
Ah, no. Argh!

02:26.080 --> 02:27.600
What the...?

02:27.600 --> 02:29.560
This felt more polite.

02:29.560 --> 02:31.680
Right.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.320
Got another dog story?

02:33.320 --> 02:35.920
I am so sorry about that.

02:35.920 --> 02:38.600
It's so stupid of me
going on about walking.

02:38.600 --> 02:40.440
What? Eh?

02:40.440 --> 02:43.040
Um, my phone's run out of charge,

02:43.040 --> 02:45.280
and I've got the
wrong keys for next door

02:45.280 --> 02:48.080
and it's chucking it down. OK.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.400
I couldn't plug it in,
could I? Phone the boss.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.640
Save me running back
to the office.

02:52.640 --> 02:55.240
I can't imagine you've done
a lot of running lately.

02:57.240 --> 02:58.680
You can use my phone.

02:58.680 --> 03:00.200
Really? Get up!

03:02.240 --> 03:03.960
You OK?

03:03.960 --> 03:05.440
Yes, it's middle age, isn't it?

03:05.440 --> 03:07.520
The old legs
not what they once were.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.000
Bad legs.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.440
Ba-a-ad legs!

03:13.720 --> 03:15.720
I'll just get my stuff.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.960
Uh, what's in the lunch box?

03:17.960 --> 03:19.640
A ham sandwich.

03:19.640 --> 03:21.760
Well, that can stay out there.
Why?

03:21.760 --> 03:23.600
I'm vegan.

03:27.520 --> 03:29.040
Course you are.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.560
Charger.

03:41.560 --> 03:42.840
Thanks.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.720
Eeee...

03:45.720 --> 03:48.000
This is so nice of you.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.440
Are you surprised to meet
a nice disabled person?

03:52.480 --> 03:54.440
Dis... You're not...

03:54.440 --> 03:55.920
Are you dis...? You...

03:55.920 --> 03:57.480
You're not dis...abled.

03:57.480 --> 04:00.240
You shouldn't say that
about yourself. You're special,

04:00.240 --> 04:01.920
and not special needs.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.200
I bet you've got exams,
have you? Course you have.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.800
Can you re...
Course you can read! Come on!

04:06.800 --> 04:09.880
So you didn't notice
the wheelchair?

04:12.280 --> 04:14.080
Yeah, I suppose I did.

04:14.080 --> 04:16.240
My peripheral vision,
I must have clocked it,

04:16.240 --> 04:17.560
like you do with fat people,

04:17.560 --> 04:19.760
I must have thought,
"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, fat."

04:19.760 --> 04:21.520
Fat?
You're not fat, you're thin.

04:21.520 --> 04:24.040
Not too thin. You're about
the right weight, are you?

04:24.040 --> 04:25.640
The phone's in there. Yeah!

04:28.000 --> 04:29.560
Left!

04:30.880 --> 04:32.440
It's here!

04:33.800 --> 04:34.920
Fucking hell.

04:37.720 --> 04:40.880
It's fine.
When are they sending someone?

04:40.880 --> 04:44.280
Yeah? No, no, it's fine.

04:44.280 --> 04:45.880
Yeah, I can wait, course.

04:45.880 --> 04:48.000
All right. All right, boss.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.080
They're sending someone over.

05:04.240 --> 05:05.840
Well...

05:09.160 --> 05:10.520
I'll be off.

05:10.520 --> 05:12.040
Uh, hey!

05:12.040 --> 05:13.360
Yes?

05:14.400 --> 05:15.640
Well...

05:15.640 --> 05:17.160
Please could you get the orange?

05:17.160 --> 05:20.240
Oh! Yes, of course.

05:20.240 --> 05:22.200
Yeah, I just...
I didn't like to presume.

05:22.200 --> 05:23.960
Presume what?

05:23.960 --> 05:25.800
Presume you didn't have a system.

05:25.800 --> 05:28.880
A system for getting an orange
out from under a sofa?

05:28.880 --> 05:31.840
Yeah, yeah. My mate works
at a rehabilitation centre

05:31.840 --> 05:34.400
for, um... And he says,
"You should never presume -

05:34.400 --> 05:35.840
"they might find it humiliating."

05:35.840 --> 05:37.440
They? Yeah.

05:37.440 --> 05:38.680
They. Them.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.160
You... Legs.

05:40.160 --> 05:41.480
Well, in this instance,

05:41.480 --> 05:44.000
isn't it just being nice
to get the orange for me?

05:44.000 --> 05:46.480
Of course. I shouldn't be
listening to Weasel anyway.

05:46.480 --> 05:49.160
He shouldn't be allowed to work
there. He's a dirty bastard.

05:49.160 --> 05:50.680
He'll bone anyone.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.400
Oh, even me?

05:52.400 --> 05:53.920
Oh, my God, he'd be all over you.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.120
And do I not want to get boned?

05:56.120 --> 05:57.880
Not by Weasel.
He's only got three teeth.

05:57.880 --> 05:59.880
Could you just get
the orange for me, please?

05:59.880 --> 06:01.800
I'll get the orange. Thank you.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.680
Uh-oh, old legs playing up again?

06:06.680 --> 06:09.840
My bloody back's gone. Oh, has it?

06:09.840 --> 06:11.360
Do you mind if I just...

06:11.360 --> 06:12.600
Sor... Sorry.

06:15.840 --> 06:18.320
There she blows.

06:18.320 --> 06:19.600
That's sore.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.680
Ooh, it stings.

06:23.680 --> 06:26.840
Oh, when it goes, it goes.

06:27.880 --> 06:31.080
Look, can I wait here
till they come?

06:31.080 --> 06:33.640
Course. I didn't like to presume.

06:33.640 --> 06:36.200
Oh, yeah, that's funny,

06:36.200 --> 06:39.720
because of the, uh, the legs.

06:47.280 --> 06:48.880
It's not just murders.

06:48.880 --> 06:52.520
Sometimes it's suicides
or just accidents, you know.

06:52.520 --> 06:54.120
So what happened to Bedford?

06:54.120 --> 06:55.240
Oh, I shouldn't say.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.400
What? Tell me.

06:56.400 --> 06:59.720
Well, he was on his
own when he died,

06:59.720 --> 07:01.600
and they didn't find him

07:01.600 --> 07:04.240
and his dog was there. So it, uh...

07:04.240 --> 07:06.760
What? It sort of...

07:06.760 --> 07:08.360
..ate his head a bit.

07:08.360 --> 07:09.960
Good.

07:09.960 --> 07:11.600
Good?

07:11.600 --> 07:13.360
Well, he never walked that dog.

07:13.360 --> 07:16.160
He deserves to get his
head eaten by it. Oh, right.

07:16.160 --> 07:18.040
So I'm not allowed to
have a ham sandwich,

07:18.040 --> 07:20.200
but it's all right for a dog
to tuck into Mr Bedford?

07:20.200 --> 07:21.720
Into his headford?

07:21.720 --> 07:23.240
Of course, it's a dog!

07:23.240 --> 07:25.240
It doesn't know any better.

07:25.240 --> 07:27.960
Yeah. Mr Bedford's deadford,
so dog ate his headford.

07:27.960 --> 07:30.840
It's not appropriate, this,
is it? Any of this? No. No.

07:30.840 --> 07:32.800
Oh.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.880
Landline? Old school.

07:34.880 --> 07:37.360
Yeah, Mum's idea.
It's a good backup, apparently.

07:37.360 --> 07:39.600
This'll be her now.
She's probably worried

07:39.600 --> 07:42.000
you're stuck under the sofa
trying to get a trapped orange.

07:43.520 --> 07:45.880
Um, uh, hi, Helena.
It...it's me.

07:45.880 --> 07:47.920
Um, look, I'm sorry to call,
it's just, I...

07:47.920 --> 07:50.280
I'm do... I'm doing
pretty terrible at the moment,

07:50.280 --> 07:51.440
and I... Oh.

07:51.440 --> 07:53.840
And I needed to...to hear
the sound of your voice. I just...

07:53.840 --> 07:56.400
Um, I-I thought
it would be a good idea to...

07:56.400 --> 07:58.000
..to look at...at some photos...

07:58.000 --> 08:00.120
Read this...
..um, of us, you know,

08:00.120 --> 08:02.960
as part of a...a healing
process, I suppose, but...

08:02.960 --> 08:05.960
I just... I just miss
you so much, Helena.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.800
I thought I'd get over it,
but I can't.

08:07.800 --> 08:11.200
Oh, God!

08:13.200 --> 08:15.920
I'm sorry.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.440
Oh, shall I?

08:17.440 --> 08:19.200
I didn't call just to...

08:19.200 --> 08:22.080
I didn't call just to cry
at you down the phone,

08:22.080 --> 08:23.680
but these photos, I just...

08:27.240 --> 08:29.200
..I love you.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.840
Bye.

08:31.840 --> 08:33.120
Mm...

08:33.120 --> 08:34.400
Wrong number?

08:34.400 --> 08:35.800
What?

08:35.800 --> 08:37.400
It's all I could think to say.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.840
It was that or put
my whole fist in my mouth.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.160
When did you split up?

08:43.160 --> 08:44.560
Two months ago.

08:44.560 --> 08:46.240
I'm sorry.

08:46.240 --> 08:49.000
Don't be. It was his fault.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.320
He knew what he was getting into,
he said he could adapt,

08:52.320 --> 08:54.680
but he couldn't.

08:54.680 --> 08:56.200
Believe me, he couldn't.

09:09.520 --> 09:10.880
Look,

09:10.880 --> 09:12.800
I know it's normal for you,

09:12.800 --> 09:14.960
but it must have been
a big change for him.

09:16.280 --> 09:18.680
Well, then, he couldn't have cared.

09:18.680 --> 09:20.600
Come on.

09:20.600 --> 09:23.040
I mean,
if you're not used to...

09:23.040 --> 09:25.680
Even holding hands must be weird,
mustn't it?

09:27.920 --> 09:29.080
What?

09:29.080 --> 09:33.000
You must feel that, any minute,
you could get carried away

09:33.000 --> 09:35.520
and just bowl you,

09:35.520 --> 09:37.720
straight into a river maybe.

09:37.720 --> 09:39.160
And then what?

09:39.160 --> 09:42.120
What happens if he books
a restaurant with a tall table?

09:42.120 --> 09:43.600
What are you talking about?

09:43.600 --> 09:46.080
Well, you'd know better than me,

09:46.080 --> 09:47.800
but book the wrong place and...

09:47.800 --> 09:51.480
..he's going to be eating
with a floating head, isn't he?

09:51.480 --> 09:54.200
He couldn't handle
the fact that I'm vegan.

09:54.200 --> 09:55.720
What?

09:55.720 --> 09:59.680
We split up because he couldn't
cope with my veganism, you idiot.

09:59.680 --> 10:01.040
Of course!

10:01.040 --> 10:02.400
Of course, that's going to be

10:02.400 --> 10:04.320
a real lifestyle clash
as well, isn't it?

10:04.320 --> 10:06.360
I mean, what's all this bullshit?

10:06.360 --> 10:08.840
Do you want another cup of tea?
I've got a really dry mouth.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.000
Have you got a dry mouth?
I'll make it, you stay...

10:11.000 --> 10:13.720
Yeah, lovely.
Lovely cup of tea, isn't it?

10:18.200 --> 10:21.040
He said it wasn't
a problem at the start.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.280
He said he'd been thinking
about it anyway because

10:23.280 --> 10:25.160
a lot of people at his
work had gone full vegan.

10:25.160 --> 10:28.120
It was perfect. And then...

10:29.480 --> 10:31.240
..my friend saw him
at the supermarket,

10:31.240 --> 10:32.840
and all he had in his basket

10:32.840 --> 10:35.120
was one big pork chop.
One big pork chop?

10:35.120 --> 10:36.600
One big pork chop.
Please tell me

10:36.600 --> 10:38.880
you didn't end a relationship
over one big pork chop?

10:38.880 --> 10:40.040
No, of course not.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.720
Thank God for that,
I was going to say!

10:41.720 --> 10:43.720
A pinch of salt,
15 minutes under the grill,

10:43.720 --> 10:46.800
it's like it never existed.
Lovely big pork chop.

10:46.800 --> 10:47.920
I have physio on Tuesdays,

10:47.920 --> 10:49.680
and he always said
he went to meet a friend.

10:49.680 --> 10:51.800
I knew it, I knew it.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.520
And I suppose...

10:54.640 --> 10:56.360
..she could walk, couldn't she?

10:56.360 --> 10:58.520
It was his friend Toby.

10:58.520 --> 10:59.920
He's gay?

10:59.920 --> 11:02.600
Gay Gareth, gay Toby, both walkers.
You poor thing.

11:02.600 --> 11:04.560
They were in a steak house!

11:04.560 --> 11:07.040
That's bad. Is it?

11:07.040 --> 11:08.240
Yeah.

11:08.240 --> 11:10.000
I confronted him there and then.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.480
I could barely stand
to be in the building.

11:12.480 --> 11:15.080
The stench of death was everywhere.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.880
He didn't even try and deny it.

11:17.880 --> 11:20.120
Said he's been going there
every week for a "meat orgy".

11:20.120 --> 11:22.680
A meat...orgy?

11:22.680 --> 11:24.680
Mm. While I was in
there, they brought out

11:24.680 --> 11:27.560
a bucket of chicken wings.
I thought I was going to be sick.

11:27.560 --> 11:30.200
Ah, tell me about it.
Disgusting, aren't they?

11:30.200 --> 11:31.320
There's nothing on 'em.

11:31.320 --> 11:33.240
It's like sucking
a little skeleton.

11:33.240 --> 11:34.600
Oh, for God's sake.

11:34.600 --> 11:35.720
Eh?

11:35.720 --> 11:37.240
Jeez.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.360
It is!

11:43.880 --> 11:45.280
Did you really dump him

11:45.280 --> 11:47.560
just cos he goes for a
steak every now and then?

11:47.560 --> 11:50.640
Well, you might be happy to date
a mass murderer, but I'm not.

11:50.640 --> 11:53.360
It's clear you've had
a few burgers, isn't it?

11:54.360 --> 11:57.040
Ah, come on!

11:57.040 --> 11:59.040
Yeah, it's fine to
kill and eat animals.

11:59.040 --> 12:01.000
Maybe I should date
a people-trafficker next,

12:01.000 --> 12:02.720
get myself a nice slave
to do my housework.

12:02.720 --> 12:05.680
You can't compare. They're animals!

12:05.680 --> 12:07.400
You're old enough
to remember The Smiths,

12:07.400 --> 12:09.920
aren't you?
Did Morrissey not get to you?

12:09.920 --> 12:12.320
Yeah, Meat Is Murder's a great song,
so is Fuck Tha Police.

12:12.320 --> 12:14.120
I don't take songs literally.

12:14.120 --> 12:16.120
I have had sex
with a policewoman, though.

12:16.120 --> 12:18.200
Look, you think...
It was a dry hump.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.760
You think that a human

12:19.760 --> 12:22.920
is more important than
an animal, obviously.

12:22.920 --> 12:25.160
Well, yeah, if I'm honest. Why?

12:25.160 --> 12:27.800
Well, because we know
we're alive, don't we?

12:27.800 --> 12:29.960
Cos we can talk
and we can wa... Heh.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.920
Walk upright? Ah, no.

12:31.920 --> 12:34.400
You can't get me like that.
I told you about my friend's dog.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.520
Oh, will you stop
with your friend and his dog

12:36.520 --> 12:37.760
walking on its hind legs?

12:37.760 --> 12:39.800
I would have reported him
for animal cruelty.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.920
The dog liked it.
It made his lipstick come out.

12:41.920 --> 12:44.680
Oh, right, well, shall we get
some photographs up, shall we?

12:44.680 --> 12:45.800
There's no need.

12:45.800 --> 12:48.240
Oh, come on,
we've got a nice one here,

12:48.240 --> 12:51.160
of a calf being slaughtered,
and a few of some baby chickens

12:51.160 --> 12:52.640
being thrown through the grinder.

12:52.640 --> 12:54.320
It'll really sharpen up
your appetite.

12:54.320 --> 12:56.600
I've seen the vegan stuff.
I get it.

12:56.600 --> 12:59.320
I just don't think you can compare
humans and animals, that's all.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.040
Because humans are
aware they're alive,

13:01.040 --> 13:02.560
because they're sentient?

13:02.560 --> 13:03.760
Well, yeah. Fine.

13:03.760 --> 13:06.600
Then go down to the old people's
home, eat an Alzheimer's patient.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.640
Oh, don't be daft. Why not?

13:08.640 --> 13:10.240
They don't know what's going on.

13:10.240 --> 13:12.680
You can have yourself
a nice Alzheimer's ribeye.

13:12.680 --> 13:14.240
I don't want
an Alzheimer's ribeye.

13:14.240 --> 13:16.520
Well, why don't you
go down to the hospital,

13:16.520 --> 13:18.000
eat a nice coma victim curry?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.400
Stop making up
delicious human dishes!

13:20.400 --> 13:22.480
Look, I can see I'm winding you up.

13:22.480 --> 13:24.960
I'm going to go and wait outside.

13:24.960 --> 13:27.800
Fine, go! You stink of death anyway.

13:27.800 --> 13:29.680
God.

13:29.680 --> 13:32.360
For the record,
the reason I stink of death

13:32.360 --> 13:33.680
is, this morning, I cleaned up

13:33.680 --> 13:36.240
the body of a woman who'd been
killed in an armed robbery.

13:36.240 --> 13:37.400
She had three children.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.520
Shall I tell them
it could have been worse?

13:39.520 --> 13:42.720
She could have been caught
going for a steak with Gareth!

13:47.080 --> 13:48.880
I like a steak myself!

13:48.880 --> 13:51.920
I'm a carnivore, and you're
not going to spoil it for me!

13:51.920 --> 13:54.360
I'd love to see your face
if you had to kill a cow.

13:54.360 --> 13:55.880
I've thought about this, actually,

13:55.880 --> 13:57.360
and I could kill a cow!

13:57.360 --> 13:58.600
You wouldn't know how to.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.520
You're like all meat-eaters,
a coward!

14:00.520 --> 14:02.560
I'd punch a cow
as soon as look at it.

14:02.560 --> 14:04.640
And then I'd eat it! Raw!

14:04.640 --> 14:06.160
Sorry about this, mate.

14:06.160 --> 14:08.760
I'm having a row with a
disabled girl about eating meat.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.640
Which reminds me,

14:10.640 --> 14:12.360
don't get me started about Quorn!

14:13.640 --> 14:15.000
Are you there?

14:15.000 --> 14:16.640
She's gone.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.640
Hello, love. Hiya, Mum.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.000
Fancy a hot pot?

15:12.000 --> 15:13.600
Yes, come in. Yay!

15:13.600 --> 15:15.240
Oh, Gareth,

15:15.240 --> 15:17.720
you have been wronged!

15:19.440 --> 15:21.480
Yeah, no, of course.

15:21.480 --> 15:23.840
Yeah, no, I'm still here.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.880
Yeah.

15:25.880 --> 15:27.640
Tell him to take his time.

15:27.640 --> 15:29.240
No, I'm happy to wait.

15:29.240 --> 15:31.360
I want to wait.

15:31.360 --> 15:32.720
Cheers, Mum. Got to go.

15:32.720 --> 15:37.080
OK. See you later, darling.
Oh, see you, Mum. Thanks!

15:37.080 --> 15:38.720
Bye! Love you. Love you!

15:38.720 --> 15:40.000
Bye! Bye!

15:43.640 --> 15:44.720
Hello?

15:47.400 --> 15:49.080
Oh. Hello.

15:49.080 --> 15:51.560
What do you want? I just wanted
to say sorry about earlier.

15:51.560 --> 15:53.840
Apology accepted. Bye!

15:59.400 --> 16:02.400
I've been, uh, reading
about the old veganism

16:02.400 --> 16:03.840
while I was waiting.

16:03.840 --> 16:05.760
Really popular these days, isn't it?

16:05.760 --> 16:07.040
Yeah, of course it is.

16:07.040 --> 16:10.240
Mm, a lot of celebrities
on the old "vege".

16:10.240 --> 16:13.760
Yeah, it's just the dinosaurs
who haven't woken up.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.640
Yeah, I didn't know about cows.

16:15.640 --> 16:18.840
Little moo cows' farts
ruining the climate.

16:18.840 --> 16:22.280
Well done. You've learnt what
most people did a decade ago.

16:22.280 --> 16:24.720
What's next? Will you be recycling?

16:24.720 --> 16:27.320
You're really like
superheroes, aren't you?

16:27.320 --> 16:30.520
You vegans.

16:31.520 --> 16:34.000
What do you want? I think I've
left some cleaning stuff here.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.120
You didn't bring any in.
A small specialist brush.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.040
I think it fell out of my pocket.
I didn't see it.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.960
It's not in my bag, so...
I've told you,

16:39.960 --> 16:42.400
there's nothing in here.
I would have seen it.

16:42.400 --> 16:43.920
Perhaps it rolled under your sofa.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.840
Like I said,
there's nothing in here.

16:45.840 --> 16:47.840
Mind if I have a look?
Yes, I do mind.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.320
I won't be long. No.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.400
I think I'm going to jump you.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.440
You wouldn't dare.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.840
I would dare.

16:56.840 --> 16:58.560
You wouldn't dare jump me.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.520
I think I'm going to jump you.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.960
No, you've got a bad back.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.480
It popped back in.

17:06.480 --> 17:07.760
No, no!

17:25.800 --> 17:27.400
Aha!

17:27.400 --> 17:29.640
What do you think you're doing?

17:29.640 --> 17:31.840
You just got jumped.

17:31.840 --> 17:34.280
And now
you're going to get judged.

17:34.280 --> 17:36.920
Ah! Jesus!

17:36.920 --> 17:39.640
I flew too close to the sun!

17:41.360 --> 17:43.000
This is for Gareth.

17:47.320 --> 17:49.800
Leave it! Leave it!

17:53.160 --> 17:55.240
Mmmm!

17:55.240 --> 17:57.720
Beef! I knew it!

18:19.720 --> 18:21.000
It's not what you think.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.320
Is it not? Because I think that
that was a hot pot full of beef!

18:25.320 --> 18:27.520
Well, it was. Unbelievable.

18:27.520 --> 18:30.160
You're not a vegan?
No, I am, I am.

18:30.160 --> 18:31.240
Did you eat that hot pot?

18:31.240 --> 18:32.520
Well, yeah, but...

18:32.520 --> 18:34.680
But nothing. Poor Gareth.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.040
No, I hate it.

18:36.040 --> 18:37.840
I just try and eat the potato,

18:37.840 --> 18:39.640
just enough to make
her think I've had it.

18:39.640 --> 18:40.800
Eh?

18:40.800 --> 18:42.920
Your mum doesn't know
you're a vegan?

18:42.920 --> 18:45.760
Well, I've tried telling her,
but she just doesn't get it.

18:45.760 --> 18:47.760
Well, tell her she can go
to the old people's home

18:47.760 --> 18:50.000
for an Alzheimer's steak.
Worked for me.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.760
Well, she took it
harder than anyone.

18:52.760 --> 18:55.000
Harder than me. What?

18:55.000 --> 18:56.760
The accident.

18:56.760 --> 18:59.400
I thought you'd always
been in a wheelchair.

18:59.400 --> 19:00.520
No.

19:01.960 --> 19:04.960
Six years ago,
car accident, drunk driver.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.840
Bastard!

19:06.840 --> 19:09.040
Why do people do that? No, no.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.480
I was the drunk driver.

19:10.480 --> 19:13.240
Yeah, well, we all like a drink
when we're stressed, don't we?

19:13.240 --> 19:14.720
Come on.
I've operated a fork lift

19:14.720 --> 19:16.480
after a bottle of Schnapps.
Who hasn't?

19:16.480 --> 19:19.280
No, I-I don't need you
to try and make me feel better.

19:19.280 --> 19:21.040
It's my own fault.

19:21.040 --> 19:22.960
I'm just lucky
that no-one else got hurt.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.520
Well, I say no-one.

19:24.520 --> 19:25.800
Oh, God.

19:26.960 --> 19:28.400
You hit a cow, didn't you?

19:28.400 --> 19:29.920
That's why you're a vegan.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.880
No! I mean my mum.

19:32.880 --> 19:36.000
She just worries
and worries so much.

19:36.000 --> 19:39.400
It's difficult seeing
your own mum look at you

19:39.400 --> 19:43.560
and then just start crying,
no reason.

19:43.560 --> 19:45.520
We could be having
a perfectly nice day,

19:45.520 --> 19:47.120
and then she'll see
me in my wheelchair

19:47.120 --> 19:50.120
and it's like she's seeing
it for the first time.

19:51.160 --> 19:52.920
But you're doing all right.

19:52.920 --> 19:55.400
I mean, you're rubbish
at getting oranges, but...

19:55.400 --> 19:57.840
I'm fine.

19:57.840 --> 19:59.920
I've adjusted and I love life.

19:59.920 --> 20:01.440
I probably do more
than I would have

20:01.440 --> 20:03.000
if it hadn't happened.

20:03.000 --> 20:05.120
So you'd recommend it,
being disabled?

20:05.120 --> 20:07.920
Oh, shut up.

20:07.920 --> 20:11.240
So, every week, she brings me
a hot pot or a shepherd's pie,

20:11.240 --> 20:13.440
and I just can't bring
myself to tell her no.

20:13.440 --> 20:16.160
It's her way of,
like, helping, you see.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.040
Her way of being a mum.

20:19.040 --> 20:22.000
I get it. My mum used
to make awesome hot pots.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.080
Oh, I'm sorry.
Is she not here any more?

20:24.080 --> 20:27.120
No, she's fine, she just
can't make hot pots any more.

20:27.120 --> 20:29.160
Dad's got a catchphrase about it.

20:29.160 --> 20:31.360
"Your mum used to be
a great cook, kids.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.960
"Now she's shit.
I wish I'd never married her."

20:33.960 --> 20:35.040
Jesus!

20:36.600 --> 20:39.080
Oh, right, well, there you go,
there's the full story.

20:39.080 --> 20:41.880
God, I'm exhausted.
I feel like I need a beer.

20:41.880 --> 20:43.640
Hmm, I'm sorry,
I can't help you there.

20:43.640 --> 20:45.400
It's got animal products in it.

20:45.400 --> 20:48.080
I prefer a joint these days, anyway.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.320
Is that right?

20:51.320 --> 20:53.360
No animals in a joint.

20:53.360 --> 20:55.080
And have you, uh...?

21:03.320 --> 21:04.880
You're like Robocop.

21:04.880 --> 21:07.120
Your move, creep.

21:07.120 --> 21:09.160
I haven't seen Robocop.

21:09.160 --> 21:10.520
Oh.

21:49.160 --> 21:51.280
How come your mum's allowed meat

21:51.280 --> 21:53.040
and Gazza isn't?

21:53.040 --> 21:54.880
It's different. How?

21:54.880 --> 21:57.600
She's my mum, silly. She raised me.

21:57.600 --> 22:00.760
When I first met him,
I told him I was vegan,

22:00.760 --> 22:02.240
and I take it seriously,

22:02.240 --> 22:04.200
and I can't be
with anyone who isn't.

22:04.200 --> 22:05.360
Right.

22:05.360 --> 22:08.000
He chose to come into my life,
she chose to give me it.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.360
I get it, your mum's
allowed meat orgies.

22:10.360 --> 22:15.400
Don't put my mum in the same
sentence as "orgies", right?

22:15.400 --> 22:18.120
Oh, and for God's sake,
do not call him Gazza again.

22:18.120 --> 22:19.520
Listen, all I'm saying is,

22:19.520 --> 22:21.240
there's a double standard there,

22:21.240 --> 22:23.960
but I'm going to let it slide
because I have a question.

22:23.960 --> 22:26.960
Oh, bloody hell. I don't want
to talk about him any more.

22:26.960 --> 22:29.880
It's not about him,
it's not about meat,

22:29.880 --> 22:32.880
but it is serious.

22:37.560 --> 22:38.920
Can you get me one?

22:40.320 --> 22:42.080
"One"?

22:42.080 --> 22:45.360
You know, it's the Holy Grail.

22:47.280 --> 22:48.560
Oh...

22:50.040 --> 22:52.520
You're talking about
a blue badge, aren't you?

22:52.520 --> 22:54.640
Sweet freedom of the city.

22:54.640 --> 22:56.800
No.

22:56.800 --> 22:59.240
I'm not getting you a bloody
disabled parking badge.

22:59.240 --> 23:01.640
Yeah, thought not.
Closed shop, ain't it?

23:01.640 --> 23:03.560
Damn right.

23:03.560 --> 23:05.000
There's got to be some perks.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.360
I'm glad you admit it.

23:06.360 --> 23:07.840
No, no, no, no.

23:07.840 --> 23:09.640
Any advantages we have are fair.

23:09.640 --> 23:10.760
Yeah, right.

23:10.760 --> 23:12.200
I seem to remember

23:12.200 --> 23:15.040
Oscar Pistorius did pretty
well on those springs.

23:15.040 --> 23:19.520
I mean, before all the horrible
murder and stuff, obviously.

23:19.520 --> 23:22.160
Springs? They weren't springs.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.800
I know a spring when I see it, mate.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.160
Guy bounced his way to victory.

23:25.160 --> 23:28.040
Right, well, let's put
your theory to the test.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.520
There's a food truck down the road.

23:29.520 --> 23:30.840
It does great vegan sausages.

23:30.840 --> 23:32.240
I can't go, can I? My back.

23:32.240 --> 23:34.440
No, I'm talking about
levelling the playing field,

23:34.440 --> 23:36.600
aren't I? A fair race.

23:36.600 --> 23:38.600
How?

23:38.600 --> 23:40.000
Got a spare, haven't I?

23:42.960 --> 23:45.520
Ah. Bring it.

23:45.520 --> 23:47.000
Oh, I'll bring it.

23:58.920 --> 24:02.200
Come on, able-bodied athlete,
you're getting thrashed!

24:07.600 --> 24:11.720
I'm in hell! Oh, what?

24:11.720 --> 24:14.200
I don't get it!

24:14.200 --> 24:16.280
Something wrong with your arms?

24:16.280 --> 24:18.360
Too many burgers,
that's your problem.

24:18.360 --> 24:22.440
Oh, you poor thing!
Does he need my help?

24:22.440 --> 24:23.720
Oh... Oh...

24:23.720 --> 24:25.440
Would you?

24:25.440 --> 24:27.080
Oh, thanks.

24:28.760 --> 24:30.160
This is so lovely of you.

24:30.160 --> 24:32.720
He's been really struggling
at the minute.

24:41.960 --> 24:43.440
So what do you think?

24:43.440 --> 24:46.000
I think I want to go and
find Gareth and have a steak.

24:46.000 --> 24:48.280
It's nice! It's just like meat.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.200
This is as like meat
as I'm like...

24:50.200 --> 24:51.640
..a goose.

24:51.640 --> 24:53.240
You'll be helping
the environment by

24:53.240 --> 24:54.440
stopping cows from farting.

24:54.440 --> 24:56.880
You think this isn't
going to make me fart?

24:56.880 --> 24:59.160
Give me half an hour,
I'll be going off like a tug boat.

25:01.920 --> 25:04.080
I'm eating it, aren't I?
I'm eating it.

25:04.080 --> 25:05.720
Bollocks! What?

25:05.720 --> 25:06.880
Oh, it's him.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.160
Who?

25:08.160 --> 25:09.360
Gareth!

25:16.320 --> 25:18.160
Oh, God,

25:18.160 --> 25:19.960
you still love him, don't you?

25:23.480 --> 25:25.480
He's amazing.

25:29.360 --> 25:31.720
Oh.

25:31.720 --> 25:34.160
All right. I'll do it.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.600
Do what?

25:35.600 --> 25:37.680
I'll go vegan one day a week.

25:37.680 --> 25:39.560
I can stomach this
shit one day a week.

25:39.560 --> 25:40.920
How's that going to help?

25:40.920 --> 25:42.560
Use your brains.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.760
If I'm not eating
meat one day a week,

25:44.760 --> 25:48.360
it means that Gareth can go
on his meat orgies, can't he?

25:48.360 --> 25:51.400
Cos there'll be one person
not eating meat, all the time.

25:51.400 --> 25:52.640
Right?

25:52.640 --> 25:55.200
No, you...
You wouldn't stick to that.

25:55.200 --> 25:58.160
You think I wouldn't eat
a soya sausage for love?

25:58.160 --> 26:01.960
I'll eat a soya sausage for love.

26:01.960 --> 26:04.280
Go on, go after him!

26:04.280 --> 26:07.120
You'll catch him easy,
he's only got legs.

26:22.440 --> 26:24.240
Hello, boss.

26:24.240 --> 26:25.720
Yeah.

26:25.720 --> 26:26.840
He's there? All right.

26:26.840 --> 26:28.320
No, I'm just down the road.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.000
Yeah, yeah, I'll get it done.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.040
All right.

26:44.280 --> 26:46.120
All right? Yeah.

26:46.120 --> 26:47.320
What are they, mate?

26:47.320 --> 26:49.280
They pork, yeah? Yeah.

26:49.280 --> 26:50.680
Go on, sort me out.

26:52.720 --> 26:54.440
Liar!

26:56.560 --> 26:58.640
Sumo Santa!

26:58.640 --> 27:00.200
I can walk!

27:00.200 --> 27:01.240
Oh!
