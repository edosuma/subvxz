00:04.983 --> 00:06.749
You disapprove of me.

00:06.749 --> 00:09.868
You know, I'd stake out a little
distance from that Shore guy, Sally.

00:09.868 --> 00:12.791
He tends to leave people's minds
a little worse off than he finds them.

00:12.791 --> 00:15.991
Why are you counseling Sally
to distance herself from me?

00:15.991 --> 00:17.485
There are happily ever after guys,

00:17.485 --> 00:20.245
and there are those
who leave girls in a heap.

00:20.245 --> 00:21.582
And I can tell the difference.

00:21.582 --> 00:24.188
Sorry, I'm late, good people.

00:30.761 --> 00:33.347
Edwin, everything all right?

00:33.347 --> 00:34.572
Hunky dory.

00:34.572 --> 00:38.739
Denny, guess what, I'm due 
in court with Tara.

00:38.739 --> 00:39.784
We're on it.

00:39.784 --> 00:40.765
Don't you worry.

00:40.765 --> 00:42.879
–You just get better.
–Okay.

00:42.879 --> 00:44.912
Demagnetize his parking pass.

00:44.912 --> 00:47.395
–I beg your pardon?
–I know when the man is gone.

01:12.242 --> 01:13.234
Helen.

01:13.234 --> 01:14.416
He's gone.

01:14.416 --> 01:15.650
Denny, Edwin's gone.

01:15.650 --> 01:17.125
I know. Shame.

01:17.125 --> 01:18.764
No, I mean he's missing.

01:18.764 --> 01:20.325
He left the hospital.

01:20.325 --> 01:22.369
–Did he come here?
–Not that I'm aware of.

01:22.369 --> 01:24.519
Anyone see Edwin Poole?

01:42.766 --> 01:45.992
Your honor, at this time
I would like to discharge counsel.

01:45.992 --> 01:48.992
Can you tell me
why you want new counsel?

01:48.992 --> 01:52.183
On the grounds of intolerabilitude.

01:52.183 --> 01:54.092
Not a real word, Mr Litch.

01:54.092 --> 01:55.889
It should be, your honor,

01:55.889 --> 01:58.628
because it describes
my deteriorating relationship

01:58.628 --> 02:02.473
with the man vested with the 
responsibility of proving my innocence.

02:02.473 --> 02:04.506
Sir, you confessed to the crime.

02:04.506 --> 02:06.089
I changed my position on that.

02:06.089 --> 02:08.696
Mr Litch, this is the seventh attorney

02:08.696 --> 02:11.441
you've sought to discharge
on the eve of trial.

02:11.441 --> 02:15.489
Your honor, I am anxious
for my day in court.

02:15.489 --> 02:19.602
I'm looking forward to seeing
12 open minds in that box,

02:19.602 --> 02:21.362
because I don't see one
when you're sitting,

02:21.362 --> 02:23.702
and I don't have one
sitting here with me.

02:23.702 --> 02:26.227
Well, here's my problem, Mr Litch.

02:26.227 --> 02:28.918
I'm all out of public defenders.

02:28.918 --> 02:32.745
Every available one, you fired.

02:32.745 --> 02:34.274
I'll do it.

02:37.254 --> 02:41.509
Attorney Edwin Poole, your honor,
of Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

02:41.509 --> 02:43.415
I'll represent Mr Litch.

02:43.415 --> 02:44.826
You're the Edwin Poole?

02:44.826 --> 02:45.646
Indeed.

02:45.646 --> 02:47.401
From Crane, Poole & Schmidt?

02:47.401 --> 02:48.231
Indeed.

02:48.231 --> 02:50.714
And you're offering
to defend this man.

02:50.714 --> 02:52.106
Yes.

02:53.602 --> 02:56.819
Mr Litch, I will give 
you a new attorney.

02:56.819 --> 02:59.203
What I will not give you
is additional time.

02:59.203 --> 03:00.755
This trial will begin tomorrow…

03:00.755 --> 03:02.271
May I be heard on bail, judge?

03:02.271 --> 03:03.938
No, you may not.
10:00 tomorrow.

03:03.938 --> 03:05.423
Defendant stays in custody.

03:05.423 --> 03:07.089
We are adjourned.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.586
Hello, Mr Criminal.

03:10.586 --> 03:12.318
We can talk back in custody.

03:12.318 --> 03:14.099
Incidentally, what are 
you charged with?

03:14.099 --> 03:15.452
Murder.

03:15.452 --> 03:18.753
You got yourself
a top-of-the-line criminal.

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON ABC: 2004/10/24

03:59.078 --> 04:00.866
–He did what?
–He took a case.

04:00.866 --> 04:03.758
Left the hospital, went into criminal 
session, and took a case.

04:03.758 --> 04:05.556
–We need you to get down there.
–Whoa.

04:05.556 --> 04:06.361
No, never mind “Whoa.”

04:06.361 --> 04:08.409
–I do not do criminal law.
–I can't go. I'm in trial.

04:08.409 --> 04:10.073
–We have lots of other lawyers.
–You used to be a D.A.

04:10.073 --> 04:11.594
–You can do it.
–What about Alan Shore? He's…

04:11.594 --> 04:12.849
Lewiston needs him
for something else.

04:12.849 --> 04:14.584
I need you to get down there, please.

04:14.584 --> 04:17.087
He is sitting in a jail cell.

04:17.087 --> 04:19.060
What do you mean he's 
sitting in a jail cell?

04:19.060 --> 04:20.998
He walked back into custody,
went into the cell.

04:20.998 --> 04:24.081
There he sits with the client,
happily so.

04:24.081 --> 04:25.784
Please get down there.

04:30.992 --> 04:32.589
So what's it about?

04:32.589 --> 04:33.977
I have no idea.

04:33.977 --> 04:35.075
Well, if you need a second chair,

04:35.075 --> 04:37.209
it would be nice for Paul Lewiston
to know that I exist.

04:37.209 --> 04:39.215
–Denny Crane.
–You got it.

04:52.538 --> 04:53.782
What can I do for you?

04:53.782 --> 04:55.742
Thank you. Please have a seat.

05:13.596 --> 05:17.303
We represent a company, the CEO

05:17.303 --> 05:21.077
of which is in need of 
immediate legal assistance.

05:21.077 --> 05:23.395
Lee Tyler, brilliant woman.

05:23.395 --> 05:25.341
Kind woman.

05:25.341 --> 05:26.984
Also a kleptomaniac.

05:26.984 --> 05:30.860
She's about to go on trial tomorrow
for stealing a $200 scarf.

05:30.860 --> 05:34.040
It's ordinarily a small matter.
Here's why it's not.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.899
If she gets convicted of this crime,

05:35.899 --> 05:38.618
she violates a morals clause
in her contract.

05:38.618 --> 05:41.008
She's out as CEO,

05:41.008 --> 05:42.585
and since she's the one who hired us,

05:42.585 --> 05:46.322
we stand to lose our biggest client.

05:48.540 --> 05:49.978
We have…

05:49.978 --> 05:56.569
exhausted all conventional
means to make this go away.

05:56.569 --> 05:59.080
We have failed.

05:59.680 --> 06:06.622
We now need an attorney
with experience in, perhaps…

06:06.622 --> 06:09.868
unconventional means.

06:13.509 --> 06:15.092
I don't care.

06:15.092 --> 06:16.443
You don't care?

06:16.443 --> 06:19.408
He basically escaped
from a mental facility.

06:19.408 --> 06:20.667
Objection.

06:20.667 --> 06:23.140
You're talking as if I'm not even
in the room. It's inappropriate.

06:23.140 --> 06:25.198
No offense, Edwin, but you
shouldn't be in the room.

06:25.198 --> 06:26.111
You should still be in the hospital.

06:26.111 --> 06:27.466
Look, Ms Colson,

06:27.466 --> 06:28.885
your firm took this case.

06:28.885 --> 06:32.611
If Edwin Poole lacks capacity
to try it, then it falls to you.

06:32.611 --> 06:34.496
Me? I don't practice criminal law.

06:34.496 --> 06:36.787
Counsel, I have had it.

06:36.787 --> 06:39.193
This case has been perversely delayed.

06:39.193 --> 06:42.388
I've had a widow and her two children
show up for trial four times,

06:42.388 --> 06:43.764
only to have it put off.

06:43.764 --> 06:45.475
I won't delay it another day.

06:45.475 --> 06:47.870
If he can't do it,
then you will.

06:47.870 --> 06:52.038
Now, I suggest you get back
there and meet your client.

06:55.738 --> 06:57.687
He pulls me over for 
running this stop sign,

06:57.687 --> 07:00.120
and I got this dime bag
of coke, you know, so…

07:00.120 --> 07:02.578
I stuff it under my seat
so he can't see it.

07:02.578 --> 07:04.205
I also got my gun under there.

07:04.205 --> 07:06.217
He's a drug dealer.

07:06.858 --> 07:08.397
Continue.

07:08.742 --> 07:10.590
So he comes to the window

07:10.590 --> 07:13.548
and gives me this and that
about road safety and all that,

07:13.548 --> 07:15.474
and then he tells me 
to step out of the car,

07:15.474 --> 07:18.238
and suddenly, I'm thinking,
damn, he's gonna search it,

07:18.238 --> 07:20.220
and two priors for intent,
I'm a dead man.

07:20.220 --> 07:21.248
That's strike three.

07:21.248 --> 07:22.659
It's a life sentence.

07:22.659 --> 07:23.814
So I panicked.

07:23.814 --> 07:24.992
I reached under the seat,

07:24.992 --> 07:27.559
I grabbed the gun,
and I shot him.

07:27.559 --> 07:28.364
Boom!

07:34.420 --> 07:36.139
Sorry…

07:36.467 --> 07:37.674
Continue.

07:37.674 --> 07:38.828
I panicked.

07:38.828 --> 07:41.265
I don't even remember it.
I'm telling you the truth.

07:41.265 --> 07:43.359
In one second, I'm thinking life sentence,

07:43.359 --> 07:46.440
and the next thing, I'm 
squeezing the trigger.

07:46.440 --> 07:48.519
–And then what happened?
–Well, I drove off,

07:48.519 --> 07:50.869
and I'm seeing on the news
how they had this big manhunt

07:50.869 --> 07:52.309
and they had a partial license plate,

07:52.309 --> 07:54.520
so I figured it was 
only a matter of time.

07:54.520 --> 07:56.367
One week later, my door's busted in.

07:56.367 --> 08:00.021
I try to go out the window,
and that's when I got shot.

08:00.021 --> 08:02.528
Finally, I just confessed
to it all in the hospital.

08:02.528 --> 08:03.608
They don't have the gun.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.529
No gun, no witnesses.

08:05.529 --> 08:06.730
They ain't got nothing.

08:06.730 --> 08:09.075
Except your confession.

08:09.075 --> 08:10.483
Yeah.

08:10.925 --> 08:14.979
Mr Criminal, I don't ever like
to make predictions,

08:14.979 --> 08:18.630
but I think we can get you off.

08:27.411 --> 08:29.581
I asked her if I could look in her bag.

08:29.581 --> 08:30.534
She said to me,

08:30.534 --> 08:32.270
“what right do you have?”

08:32.270 --> 08:35.153
I said, “well, ma'am, I'm 
a security officer for the store.”

08:35.153 --> 08:36.447
And then what happened, sir?

08:36.447 --> 08:38.075
She let me look in her bag,

08:38.075 --> 08:39.695
and there was the scarf.

08:39.695 --> 08:40.804
Did she say anything?

08:40.804 --> 08:43.645
Said she had no idea how it got there.

08:44.193 --> 08:45.200
Tell me, Mr Lyne,

08:45.200 --> 08:48.876
from what distance did you see 
the accused put the scarf in her bag?

08:48.876 --> 08:50.464
I didn't actually see it myself.

08:50.464 --> 08:52.424
–Oh, you didn't see it.
–No.

08:52.424 --> 08:54.410
A store clerk said she took it.

08:54.410 --> 08:55.741
Ah, there we go.

08:55.741 --> 08:58.526
Do you see the store clerk
here today, sir? –Yes, I do.

08:58.526 --> 09:02.355
Miles Tibbet, sitting right over there.

09:03.570 --> 09:07.492
This man. He told you 
the defendant took the scarf.

09:07.492 --> 09:08.931
Yes, he did.

09:15.319 --> 09:17.280
How do you feel about 
working undercover?

09:17.280 --> 09:18.238
I'm sorry?

09:18.238 --> 09:21.059
Their entire case is a store clerk.

09:21.059 --> 09:23.605
I want to put a private 
investigator on him, follow him.

09:23.605 --> 09:26.083
We pick the opportunity for you 
to meet him, lunch, perhaps.

09:26.083 --> 09:27.368
–And then what?
–Denny Crane.

09:27.368 --> 09:30.584
Then you order appetizers,
elicit some disparaging information,

09:30.584 --> 09:32.702
allowing him to believe
you're anyone at all

09:32.702 --> 09:34.667
other than the defendant's lawyer.

09:34.667 --> 09:36.314
Is that fair?

09:36.761 --> 09:38.725
I don't understand the question.

09:39.740 --> 09:41.932
He says he grew up
watching “Perry Mason,”

09:41.932 --> 09:46.310
and he promised himself he 
would one day do a criminal trial.

09:46.310 --> 09:49.401
Certainly you're not going to let him.

09:49.401 --> 09:52.514
He seems to have his wits about him.

09:52.514 --> 09:55.556
The truth is is he's probably
more equipped than me.

09:55.556 --> 10:01.001
I think the best thing would be for me
to supervise and let him first chair.

10:08.574 --> 10:10.217
Edwin.

10:10.308 --> 10:11.829
Paul.

10:14.672 --> 10:16.943
You really think you're up to this?

10:16.943 --> 10:18.681
I did clinical work in law school.

10:18.681 --> 10:20.540
The rules of evidence 
are the same as civil.

10:20.540 --> 10:22.980
There's no great mystery to it.

10:26.284 --> 10:28.038
Also…

10:29.223 --> 10:31.019
he came to me in a dream last night,

10:31.019 --> 10:34.868
and he told me to try this case.

10:36.617 --> 10:38.197
God?

10:38.455 --> 10:39.979
Perry.

10:44.776 --> 10:46.445
I'll first chair.

11:01.382 --> 11:02.431
Can I help you?

11:02.431 --> 11:04.005
Whatever's on tap.

11:04.005 --> 11:05.046
I got it.

11:06.571 --> 11:07.945
How's it going?

11:09.819 --> 11:11.974
Fine, thank you.

11:14.096 --> 11:15.266
Sally.

11:18.586 --> 11:19.723
You're…

11:19.723 --> 11:23.067
very beautiful, but I don't…

11:23.067 --> 11:25.793
do that sort of thing.

11:25.983 --> 11:28.134
What sort of thing?

11:32.840 --> 11:35.486
What, you, you think
I'm a hooker?

11:35.486 --> 11:36.407
Here you go.

11:36.407 --> 11:39.034
Excuse me, can you throw that
in this man's face?

11:39.034 --> 11:40.718
I'm sorry, but…

11:40.718 --> 11:43.471
but beautiful women don't
usually come up to me

11:43.471 --> 11:45.131
and say hi unless…

11:45.131 --> 11:48.794
Well, excuse me for thinking
you look like a decent guy.

11:53.031 --> 11:55.965
Do you know how hard it is
for a girl to just…

11:55.965 --> 12:00.291
go out for a quiet beer by herself
without being attacked by wolves?

12:00.291 --> 12:03.922
I thought you looked safe and nice.

12:03.922 --> 12:05.984
And you call me a hooker.

12:09.846 --> 12:10.961
Learn anything?

12:10.961 --> 12:12.507
Only his whole life story,

12:12.507 --> 12:15.707
and no one is bidding for 
the movie rights, trust me.

12:15.707 --> 12:18.830
He collects autographs, 
has almost 1,200 of them,

12:18.830 --> 12:23.832
including the entire cast
of “Mamma Mia!” national tour.

12:23.832 --> 12:26.962
Oh, yes, and he's allergic
to shellfish. Want more?

12:26.962 --> 12:29.304
Yes. This is very helpful.

12:32.787 --> 12:34.055
Hello?

12:34.436 --> 12:35.555
It's him.

12:36.171 --> 12:38.858
Hi, Miles. How's it going?

12:39.120 --> 12:41.081
We would like to be able
to offer you witnesses.

12:41.081 --> 12:43.740
Unfortunately, there were only two.

12:43.740 --> 12:46.421
One's dead, and the other's on trial.

12:46.421 --> 12:48.506
The good news is he confessed,

12:48.506 --> 12:50.445
though he now wants to recant.

12:50.445 --> 12:53.911
You will hear from the officer
who listened to that confession,

12:53.911 --> 12:55.934
and you will find it reliable.

12:55.934 --> 12:58.684
You will find it consistent 
with the truth,

12:58.684 --> 13:01.081
the truth that on July 17th,

13:01.081 --> 13:07.334
the defendant Warren Litch
shot dead officer Michael Deveraux.

13:16.973 --> 13:17.982
Good morning.

13:17.982 --> 13:19.308
My name is Lori Colson…

13:19.308 --> 13:22.287
Your honor, at this time,
I would like to discharge counsel.

13:22.287 --> 13:24.262
–Denied. –In that case, 
it should be known

13:24.262 --> 13:27.025
that this woman didn't even 
bother to meet me until yesterday.

13:27.025 --> 13:29.294
My own lawyer! She didn't 
even know my name.

13:29.294 --> 13:31.505
She is unprofessional,
she is unprepared,

13:31.505 --> 13:33.554
and on top of that, she's fleshy.

13:33.554 --> 13:37.297
I want me a thin, wiry attorney,
somebody hungry for justice.

13:37.297 --> 13:40.148
Motion for new counsel denied.

13:40.148 --> 13:42.528
May I have a moment
with my client, your honor?

13:42.528 --> 13:44.113
Please.

13:45.794 --> 13:47.393
What the hell was that?

13:47.393 --> 13:48.657
I didn't like the look of the jury.

13:48.657 --> 13:50.039
I was going for a mistrial.

13:50.039 --> 13:51.550
Well, you didn't get one, did you?

13:51.550 --> 13:54.822
All you did was alienate them
and undermine me in the process.

13:54.822 --> 13:57.094
Do you want to go to prison?

13:57.094 --> 13:59.332
Lady, I'm going to prison.

13:59.332 --> 14:00.555
I shot a cop.

14:00.555 --> 14:02.660
No doubt I'm going to prison.

14:02.660 --> 14:05.502
The only real living I got left
is in this trial business,

14:05.502 --> 14:08.444
and I'm happy to stretch it
out forever.

14:09.653 --> 14:14.533
You think this is some game for you,
to have your last joyride?

14:14.533 --> 14:17.536
I killed a man, miss Colson.

14:18.664 --> 14:21.895
And I see his widow sitting 
in there, and I see his kids.

14:21.895 --> 14:24.745
I know this ain't no game.

14:25.803 --> 14:27.286
Son…

14:27.286 --> 14:29.808
if I might ask…

14:30.389 --> 14:33.087
why did you call her fleshy?

14:33.087 --> 14:35.191
I was just trying to humanize her.

14:35.191 --> 14:38.204
Juries don't like beautiful women.

14:38.826 --> 14:41.242
You think I'm fleshy?

14:42.114 --> 14:44.920
Is there any deal to be 
made here, a plea?

14:44.920 --> 14:47.574
They don't need to deal, Warren.
You confessed.

14:47.574 --> 14:49.325
Another curious strategic move.

14:49.325 --> 14:52.400
I only confessed because 
they tricked me.

14:55.736 --> 14:57.711
What do you mean, they tricked you?

14:57.711 --> 15:00.415
They got the doctor to tell 
me I was about to die,

15:00.415 --> 15:02.290
and then they sent
in this cop undercover

15:02.290 --> 15:04.332
pretending to be the hospital chaplain,

15:04.332 --> 15:07.674
and he laid it on thick 
with the whole confess thy sins

15:07.674 --> 15:09.691
or there's no heaven for me.

15:09.691 --> 15:12.770
They told you you were dying
to get you to confess?

15:12.770 --> 15:13.964
Yeah.

15:19.553 --> 15:22.312
And then he pointed to me,
right in open court.

15:22.312 --> 15:23.162
What'd you do?

15:23.162 --> 15:26.020
I just tried to sit straight
and undaunted.

15:26.020 --> 15:27.919
The chief witness for 
the prosecution, you know.

15:27.919 --> 15:29.101
Isn't it exciting?

15:29.101 --> 15:30.369
It is.

15:30.369 --> 15:31.889
I…

15:32.925 --> 15:36.624
I even invited a few of my friends to, 
you know, come watch.

15:36.624 --> 15:39.383
You did? –It's silly, I know, but this 
is the first time

15:39.383 --> 15:42.530
I've been at the center of,
of anything.

15:42.530 --> 15:43.585
I'm sure you'll do fine.

15:43.585 --> 15:44.582
–Really?
–Mm.

15:44.582 --> 15:48.088
Yeah. I, I don't think
I'll get too nervous.

15:48.284 --> 15:53.349
I take beta blockers for anxiety.

15:53.349 --> 15:55.310
Retail must be very stressful.

15:55.310 --> 15:58.359
Yes, but I love it.

16:02.016 --> 16:06.316
Listen, um, you're probably 
wondering why I asked you to lunch.

16:06.316 --> 16:07.739
I just…

16:10.540 --> 16:13.530
I, I don't meet too many women.

16:13.530 --> 16:14.791
It's not what you think, I swear.

16:14.791 --> 16:18.123
I'm not about to ask you 
out on a date or anything,

16:18.123 --> 16:23.105
but I did want to tell you

16:23.105 --> 16:27.679
how much last night meant to me.

16:28.205 --> 16:31.222
What did it mean?
We drank beer.

16:34.122 --> 16:36.001
Sally…

16:36.001 --> 16:40.604
for, for a beautiful woman 
to talk to me

16:40.604 --> 16:44.643
for three hours as if…

16:44.643 --> 16:46.634
I were an interesting person,

16:46.634 --> 16:50.682
as if my life were interesting…

16:51.699 --> 16:54.425
That meant something to me.

16:55.942 --> 16:58.662
That's really all I wanted to say. I,

16:58.662 --> 17:00.916
I'm grateful.

17:02.019 --> 17:03.231
Cheers.

17:09.122 --> 17:10.184
Denny.

17:10.698 --> 17:13.714
I need you at 12:30.
It'll take five minutes, tops.

17:13.714 --> 17:18.550
I need to trade a little
on your prominence, your heft.

17:18.915 --> 17:20.252
What do you want me to do?

17:20.252 --> 17:22.526
I don't want you to do anything 
or say anything.

17:22.526 --> 17:24.056
I just want you to be.

17:24.056 --> 17:25.935
Be all that you can be.

17:25.935 --> 17:28.190
One of the few, the proud.

17:28.630 --> 17:30.626
You don't want me to say anything?

17:30.626 --> 17:34.390
Just those two little words
that tend to shock and awe.

17:34.390 --> 17:36.433
Denny Crane.

17:37.024 --> 17:42.379
Feel free to mock me all you want,
but don't you dare ridicule our troops.

17:42.379 --> 17:46.488
Just so I'm clear,
I should feel free to mock you.

17:52.642 --> 17:54.871
He basically said that he panicked.

17:54.871 --> 17:57.092
His next conviction was strike three.

17:57.092 --> 17:59.976
He'd be looking at a life sentence,
and he just panicked.

17:59.976 --> 18:01.655
And by panicked, you mean…

18:01.655 --> 18:03.447
he reached under the seat,
retrieved the weapon,

18:03.447 --> 18:04.876
and shot the officer.

18:04.876 --> 18:07.359
He told you he shot officer Deveraux?

18:07.359 --> 18:08.536
Yes, sir.

18:08.536 --> 18:10.609
He asked me to forgive him,

18:10.609 --> 18:13.069
and he asked God to forgive him.

18:13.276 --> 18:14.908
Thank you, officer.

18:17.776 --> 18:19.227
Your honor, at this time,
I would…

18:19.227 --> 18:20.715
Sit!

18:22.207 --> 18:23.411
Just to remind the jury,

18:23.411 --> 18:25.371
at the time my client said 
all of this to you,

18:25.371 --> 18:26.554
he thought he was dying.

18:26.554 --> 18:27.573
Yes, ma'am.

18:27.573 --> 18:30.881
And he thought you were 
the hospital chaplain?

18:30.881 --> 18:32.231
Yes, ma'am.

18:33.215 --> 18:34.985
Thank you, officer.

18:37.235 --> 18:38.650
That's it?

18:38.650 --> 18:41.395
Two questions. 
That was your cross?

18:41.395 --> 18:43.724
I didn't have much
to cross him with, Warren.

18:43.724 --> 18:45.317
Then what was the point of your questions?

18:45.317 --> 18:48.889
Tell me that. –I was trying to establish
that you were coerced.

18:48.889 --> 18:51.654
The judge doesn't shock easily,
but maybe the jury does.

18:51.654 --> 18:54.209
Oh, I see. 
You were going for shock value.

18:54.209 --> 18:55.864
Well, maybe you could 
have really gone for it

18:55.864 --> 18:57.185
and asked three questions.

18:57.185 --> 18:59.284
Hey, Warren, if you're 
unhappy with me…

18:59.284 --> 19:00.283
Then what?

19:00.283 --> 19:03.058
The judge isn't gonna let 
me hire anybody else.

19:03.058 --> 19:05.533
You're all I got, lady.

19:07.624 --> 19:10.038
You're all I got.

19:18.514 --> 19:20.445
Thank you so much for coming, 
Alan Shore.

19:20.445 --> 19:22.677
The D.A. said I didn't 
have to talk to you.

19:22.677 --> 19:25.668
Which only compounds my gratitude
for your choosing to do so.

19:25.668 --> 19:26.844
Let's go to my office.

19:26.844 --> 19:27.684
What's this about?

19:27.684 --> 19:30.172
Well, believe it or not,
it's about your best interest, Miles.

19:30.172 --> 19:31.848
Gosh, my office seems so far away.

19:31.848 --> 19:34.188
Let's go to this one
over here instead.

19:37.201 --> 19:39.411
Sally Heep, Miles Tibbet.
Perhaps you've met.

19:39.411 --> 19:41.839
Sally gets around.
She works with me.

19:41.839 --> 19:43.718
And certainly you've heard
of this gentleman.

19:43.718 --> 19:46.275
–He needs no introdtion.
–Denny Crane.

19:47.028 --> 19:48.582
Please have a seat.

19:48.582 --> 19:49.570
Alan…

19:49.570 --> 19:51.086
Thank you, Sally,
I'll take it from here.

19:51.086 --> 19:52.733
You've done more than your share.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.214
Let's make this brief, Miles.

19:54.214 --> 19:57.321
We represent a woman who is
charged with stealing a scarf

19:57.321 --> 19:58.581
from the store where you work,

19:58.581 --> 20:01.004
which is precisely what she did.
You saw the whole thing.

20:01.004 --> 20:04.188
So we find ourselves between
a rock and a hard place, Miles.

20:04.188 --> 20:07.065
The rock being our client,
CEO of a fortune 500 company

20:07.065 --> 20:10.839
who has made it abundantly clear
the only acceptable verdict is not guilty.

20:10.839 --> 20:13.875
And the hard place being you, 
Miles, the eyewitness.

20:13.875 --> 20:18.864
But maybe you aren't so hard
after all? Am I right?

20:18.864 --> 20:19.772
I'm not sure what you want.

20:19.772 --> 20:22.050
Sally has given me some 
information which, regrettably,

20:22.050 --> 20:24.196
I'm ethically required
to attack you with in court.

20:24.196 --> 20:27.426
For example, since I know you 
take beta blockers for your anxiety.

20:27.426 --> 20:30.498
some possible side effects being
dizziness, confusion,

20:30.498 --> 20:32.592
I am duty bound to raise it.

20:32.592 --> 20:34.532
Also, the idea that you invited

20:34.532 --> 20:37.148
a few friends down to the courthouse
to hear you testify…

20:37.148 --> 20:40.164
it would be malpractice for me
not to make a small snack of that.

20:40.164 --> 20:42.538
Of course, I'll have to get 
into your inferiority complex and

20:42.538 --> 20:43.905
“She must be a hooker” that sort of thing.

20:43.905 --> 20:45.369
–But I never said…
–I'm talking, Miles.

20:45.369 --> 20:47.084
Alan… –I'm talking, Sally.

20:47.084 --> 20:49.517
You collect autographs, Miles.
That must be fun.

20:49.517 --> 20:51.253
Standing around on cold,
drizzly nights

20:51.253 --> 20:53.604
waiting for famous people
to give you a cursory glance,

20:53.604 --> 20:56.037
a moment of their time, perhaps,
if they take pity on you.

20:56.037 --> 20:57.846
Do people often take pity on you, Miles?

20:57.846 --> 21:00.275
It wouldn't surprise me.
I'm seeing a pattern here.

21:00.275 --> 21:04.188
Pity, anxiety, inferiority
all those “-ity” words.

21:04.188 --> 21:06.712
–This isn't fair!
–You're right, it's not.

21:06.712 --> 21:10.911
But you have a job to do 
and so do I.

21:10.911 --> 21:15.344
Yours is to sell socks and suspenders.

21:15.344 --> 21:20.833
Mine is to cross-examine people
like you and crush them.

21:20.833 --> 21:23.049
This man here would fire 
me if I didn't.

21:23.049 --> 21:24.314
Denny Crane.

21:24.314 --> 21:25.911
He would fire me, Miles,

21:25.911 --> 21:30.873
if I didn't explore every nuance 
and shadow of your personality,

21:30.873 --> 21:34.611
every secret place and 
insufficiency in the hours

21:34.611 --> 21:36.582
that you will spend in that 
witness chair, Miles,

21:36.582 --> 21:38.393
in front of all those friends you invited.

21:38.393 --> 21:39.734
And when I'm finished with you,

21:39.734 --> 21:43.896
even they will believe you are 
a vindictive, pathetic little sycophant

21:43.896 --> 21:45.418
who has falsely accused,

21:45.418 --> 21:47.340
and probably framed a fine woman

21:47.340 --> 21:49.961
for something she never did 
and never would do

21:49.961 --> 21:53.248
only so that you could get,
at long last, your moment of attention.

21:53.248 --> 21:54.650
By the time I'm done,

21:54.650 --> 21:59.474
I'll have you believing you 
put that scarf in her handbag.

22:09.778 --> 22:13.819
Lee Tyler can afford to hire
any attorney in the world.

22:13.819 --> 22:16.009
She's chosen me.

22:16.009 --> 22:19.443
Do you wonder if I'm any good, Miles?

22:21.114 --> 22:23.471
Do you really wonder?

22:43.530 --> 22:47.425
–May I speak with you a moment?
–I don't wanna speak with you, Alan.

22:47.425 --> 22:52.170
–If I told you Miles was coming…
–I do not want to speak with you.

22:52.170 --> 22:55.364
Can you please walk away?

23:01.223 --> 23:04.435
Sally, that was not
a pleasant meeting.

23:04.435 --> 23:09.309
Typically, when associates 
are unhappy, I give them a hug.

23:09.309 --> 23:10.954
I don't want a hug, Mr Crane.

23:10.954 --> 23:12.117
Okay.

23:12.913 --> 23:15.107
May I have one?

23:20.715 --> 23:24.034
They told me that he was religious,

23:24.034 --> 23:27.581
that maybe if he though
the was about to die,

23:27.581 --> 23:30.004
his conscience would get 
the better of him.

23:30.004 --> 23:32.072
So you told Mr Litch was dying.

23:32.072 --> 23:33.828
Yeah. I'm not proud of it,

23:33.828 --> 23:35.711
but I probably should have…

23:35.711 --> 23:40.100
and, doctor, 
did you also hear Mr Litch

23:40.100 --> 23:42.904
confess to killing officer Deveraux?

23:42.904 --> 23:43.932
Yes.

23:43.932 --> 23:45.208
You're sure?

23:45.208 --> 23:47.282
I'm very positive.

23:47.282 --> 23:48.508
Thank you, doctor.

23:55.346 --> 23:58.215
Okay, how long had he 
treated you before…

23:58.215 --> 24:02.432
In fact, you told him he had
less than an hour to live.

24:02.432 --> 24:03.197
Yes.

24:03.197 --> 24:05.268
You lied to your own patient?

24:05.268 --> 24:08.499
They told me that he had
murdered a police officer…

24:08.499 --> 24:10.952
As a result of this despicable conduct,

24:10.952 --> 24:13.036
were you disciplined by the hospital?

24:13.036 --> 24:15.866
My privileges were suspended
for three months.

24:15.866 --> 24:17.710
And you're back in the E.R. now.

24:17.710 --> 24:18.683
No, no.

24:18.683 --> 24:21.823
I've started my residency
in the neurology department.

24:21.823 --> 24:23.696
Your specialty is the brain.

24:23.696 --> 24:25.592
Yes. –Doctor, as a neurologist,

24:25.592 --> 24:29.486
how does trauma and extensive 
blood loss affect the brain?

24:29.486 --> 24:33.110
Uh, sometimes it can compromise
mental function.

24:33.110 --> 24:35.026
Can it cause a person
to become delusional?

24:35.026 --> 24:37.513
I don't believe he was 
delusional that night.

24:37.513 --> 24:41.156
Did he suffer trauma and 
extensive blood loss? –Yes.

24:41.156 --> 24:43.031
Yes, he, he did, but I…

24:43.031 --> 24:47.579
can you state to a medical certainty
that he was not delusional?

24:51.452 --> 24:53.058
No.

24:59.200 --> 25:03.807
One last question and this one I ask
you as a layperson, a human being.

25:03.807 --> 25:08.810
Is it conceivable to you that if you 
had a loved one who had panicked

25:08.810 --> 25:11.642
and committed a horrible 
crime, say, murder…

25:11.642 --> 25:15.107
if somebody you cared deeply for,
perhaps a brother, best friend,

25:15.107 --> 25:17.435
maybe your son had done
thihorrible thing,

25:17.435 --> 25:22.391
and you lay in a hospital bed dying,

25:22.391 --> 25:25.094
Is it conceivable that 
knowing you were dying,

25:25.094 --> 25:29.303
you might take the blame
for something you didn't do

25:29.303 --> 25:31.944
just to spare your loved one
a life sentence?

25:31.944 --> 25:32.926
Objection! –Sustained.

25:32.926 --> 25:34.550
Did it ever occur to you
that night, doctor?

25:34.550 --> 25:36.556
Warren Litch said 
he committed the crime

25:36.556 --> 25:39.905
simply to protect somebody else?

25:39.905 --> 25:41.913
No. No, it didn't.

25:45.924 --> 25:49.292
I bet it never occurred
to the police, either.

25:54.085 --> 25:55.736
Nothing further.

26:02.333 --> 26:04.492
Mr Preston?

26:04.694 --> 26:07.333
The prosecution rests, your honor.

26:08.037 --> 26:09.438
Ms Colson?

26:13.153 --> 26:15.966
The defense rests, your honor.

26:21.631 --> 26:23.419
How do I not get in that chair?

26:23.419 --> 26:24.735
Edwin did a good job.

26:24.735 --> 26:26.914
If I don't say I didn't do it,
they're not…

26:26.914 --> 26:29.229
–I can't put you in that chair.
–Why?

26:29.229 --> 26:30.418
Because you did do it,

26:30.418 --> 26:32.619
and I can't put a witness
in the chair to lie.

26:32.619 --> 26:34.253
I have a right to testify.

26:34.253 --> 26:36.321
But it would have to be
in the narrative.

26:36.321 --> 26:38.845
Best case scenario, you'll 
trip all over yourself.

26:38.845 --> 26:41.851
Worst case, one of the jurors will 
know why it's in the narrative.

26:41.851 --> 26:43.883
And why can't you ask me
questions that would allow…

26:43.883 --> 26:46.301
Because I can't.

26:46.562 --> 26:47.817
We have rules, Warren.

26:47.817 --> 26:51.537
One is I cannot put you up 
there to knowingly lie.

26:51.537 --> 26:53.283
Our best strategy here 
would be to argue

26:53.283 --> 26:55.532
the prosecution didn't 
satisfy its burden.

26:55.532 --> 26:58.973
This is my life on the line here,

27:00.092 --> 27:03.282
and you keep talking about
a system of rules and regulations?

27:03.282 --> 27:06.340
I'm in this for my life here.

27:06.553 --> 27:10.231
And you're supposed to be
in this for my life, too.

27:11.202 --> 27:13.578
Well, I'm not.

27:13.578 --> 27:17.227
Don't get me wrong, I will give you
the very best defense I know how,

27:17.227 --> 27:21.100
but I will not allow myself
to be in this for you.

27:21.100 --> 27:22.771
I will play my part in a system

27:22.771 --> 27:24.847
that I have an enormous allegiance to,

27:24.847 --> 27:29.169
but I will never be in this for you.

27:44.185 --> 27:45.405
Hey.

27:48.592 --> 27:51.860
That was pretty awesome today, Edwin.

27:52.263 --> 27:55.551
People forget I'm 
a brilliant trial attorney.

27:55.551 --> 27:58.415
I can be nuts and still brilliant.

27:59.053 --> 28:02.122
How do you feel about closing?

28:02.122 --> 28:04.561
If you can close like 
you crossed, then…

28:04.561 --> 28:08.047
That was Perry's strength,
you know, the closing.

28:08.047 --> 28:09.697
What do you think?

28:10.385 --> 28:12.209
I told the man I'd get him a
“not guilty,”

28:12.209 --> 28:14.891
I might as well see it through.

28:17.764 --> 28:19.788
It's hard, isn't it?

28:20.655 --> 28:22.449
What is?

28:22.449 --> 28:27.714
Coming to care for a person
who committed such a heinous act.

28:27.714 --> 28:32.729
It's hard to reconcile what 
we do and who we are sometimes.

28:33.089 --> 28:35.595
I don't care about him.

28:35.982 --> 28:38.570
I'm just doing a job.

28:42.177 --> 28:47.226
You know, in Perry's closings,
he would point to the real killer.

28:48.788 --> 28:51.723
I don't suppose I should 
do that, should I?

29:14.826 --> 29:17.463
Tibbet's a good man,
Alan, decent.

29:17.463 --> 29:19.798
He was just doing his job.

29:19.798 --> 29:23.157
Yes, he was, and so were you,
and so was I.

29:23.157 --> 29:26.049
And after ambushing him,
you can just shake it off?

29:26.049 --> 29:27.453
I'm not shaking anything off.

29:27.453 --> 29:30.442
Miles Tibbet had a very bad day.

29:30.442 --> 29:33.090
I had a bad day, too, Alan.

29:33.090 --> 29:34.816
I was taken advantage of.

29:34.816 --> 29:36.755
Or don't you considersending me

29:36.755 --> 29:39.217
to go hit on some guy 
at a bartaking advantage?

29:39.217 --> 29:41.644
It has nothing to with what I consider.

29:41.644 --> 29:43.315
Whatever.

29:44.055 --> 29:49.904
It's not the kind of thing you ask
of someone that you care about.

29:51.135 --> 29:54.034
Do you care about me, Alan?

29:54.034 --> 29:57.277
I care a great deal for you.

29:57.277 --> 30:02.245
That's why I'm gonna give 
you some very sound advice.

30:03.727 --> 30:05.782
Run.

30:06.404 --> 30:09.454
What? –This is a bad business.

30:09.454 --> 30:11.032
It is an often filthy,

30:11.032 --> 30:14.421
dehumanizing, mean-spirited job.

30:14.421 --> 30:17.303
I assure you I take no pleasure in it.

30:17.303 --> 30:18.946
It just comes easily to me.

30:18.946 --> 30:20.332
But…

30:22.965 --> 30:25.063
you…

30:29.897 --> 30:33.162
are not that way.

30:33.707 --> 30:38.269
So I suggest you think long and hard

30:38.269 --> 30:42.974
about whether you really wanna
wake up every morning,

30:42.974 --> 30:48.366
with all the promise that
morning conveys,

30:48.727 --> 30:51.301
and come here.

30:54.754 --> 30:57.212
Which I say to you…

30:57.212 --> 31:00.577
only because I care.

31:01.630 --> 31:04.652
You are such a liar,

31:04.652 --> 31:09.035
pretending that this stuff
doesn't affect you,

31:09.035 --> 31:12.942
that you can just brush it off.

31:13.617 --> 31:16.059
I'm afraid I can.

31:29.744 --> 31:31.546
You heard from witness
Frank Simmons,

31:31.546 --> 31:33.942
who saw an SUV speed by him

31:33.942 --> 31:36.804
a mile from the scene
around the time of the murder

31:36.804 --> 31:40.230
with a license plate
beginning with “3L6.”

31:40.230 --> 31:44.894
Mr Litch's SUV has a license
plate beginning with “3L6.”

31:44.894 --> 31:46.962
And when the police entered 
the defendant's apartment,

31:46.962 --> 31:48.170
what did he do?

31:48.170 --> 31:50.629
He didn't ask, “what's this about?”

31:50.629 --> 31:52.632
He didn't say, “hey, what's going on?”

31:52.632 --> 31:54.934
He knew exactly why they were there.

31:54.934 --> 31:57.269
And he immediately 
began his escape.

31:57.269 --> 32:00.110
And then, in the hospital,
he confessed.

32:00.110 --> 32:02.121
It wasn't a delusional confession.

32:02.121 --> 32:06.089
He described a fact pattern which
was completely consistent with the crime.

32:06.089 --> 32:09.311
The defendant admitted that he was
afraid of yet

32:09.311 --> 32:12.396
another drug conviction
that would land him a life sentence.

32:12.396 --> 32:16.467
He panicked, pulled out 
a gun, and fired.

32:16.894 --> 32:18.796
Now his lawyer suggests

32:18.796 --> 32:20.782
he was perhaps delusional
when he confessed,

32:20.782 --> 32:25.624
or that he simply lied to protect 
the real killer, a friend or loved one.

32:25.624 --> 32:29.275
Desperate suggestions 
for a desperate client.

32:29.275 --> 32:32.486
It's insulting to this court, to you,

32:32.486 --> 32:36.541
and especially to that woman
and her two children.

32:36.541 --> 32:38.656
Warren Litch murdered her husband.

32:38.656 --> 32:41.437
Warren Litch killed their father.

32:41.437 --> 32:44.672
He admitted to the police
that he did so.

32:45.371 --> 32:48.441
Let's not waste any more time.

33:03.035 --> 33:04.169
Edwin.

33:05.707 --> 33:07.660
It's your turn.

33:09.717 --> 33:13.936
I fell asleep last night
and forgot to prepare a closing.

33:13.936 --> 33:15.671
I meant to tell you.

33:15.671 --> 33:17.153
You don't have a closing?

33:17.153 --> 33:18.781
No, do you?

33:19.633 --> 33:21.453
Counsel?

33:21.453 --> 33:24.598
Edwin, you've got nothing?

33:31.672 --> 33:35.022
When I was a little boy,
my father said to me.

33:35.022 --> 33:38.502
–I can still hear his voice.
–I believe he said,

33:38.502 --> 33:40.326
“Ladies first.”

33:47.702 --> 33:50.251
I don't know about you,

33:50.251 --> 33:53.584
but if I hear that somebody
confessed to a crime,

33:53.584 --> 33:56.274
I just assume he's guilty.

33:56.497 --> 34:00.227
But if I hear the confession
is coerced, then…

34:02.626 --> 34:04.422
for example,

34:04.422 --> 34:07.231
you could have a man
bleeding out with a stomach wound,

34:07.231 --> 34:08.774
put him in a room 
with police and clergy

34:08.774 --> 34:11.272
who keep insisting to him
that he did something,

34:11.272 --> 34:13.786
and he might actually come
to believe it.

34:13.786 --> 34:15.670
And gee, what if it was 
a friend or a loved one

34:15.670 --> 34:17.349
who was driving Warren's 
car that night?

34:17.349 --> 34:20.621
That would explain why Warren 
was trying to flee, wouldn't it?

34:20.621 --> 34:24.047
He likely knew the police were coming
to mistakenly arrest him.

34:24.047 --> 34:26.326
Did the police investigate any of this?

34:26.326 --> 34:28.174
My God, we all assume 
Warren Litch is guilty,

34:28.174 --> 34:30.293
but what if he isn't?

34:32.175 --> 34:36.282
Now let's turn to the other evidence.

34:36.282 --> 34:37.726
Wait…

34:38.125 --> 34:40.437
There is no other evidence.

34:40.437 --> 34:43.016
No gun, no witnesses,
no fibers, no forensics.

34:43.016 --> 34:45.550
All they have is that coerced confession.

34:45.550 --> 34:47.962
Now, you might think he did it.

34:47.962 --> 34:51.934
And if you're determined, you can 
even still assume it, I suppose.

34:51.934 --> 34:53.803
But if you're to uphold the law and

34:53.803 --> 34:56.400
demand proof beyond 
all reasonable doubt,

34:56.400 --> 34:58.402
and if we don't demand that,

34:58.402 --> 35:01.820
do we really wanna send
a message to the police…

35:01.820 --> 35:04.472
“Hey, forget the evidence.

35:04.472 --> 35:07.935
Just bring us that confession.”

35:36.621 --> 35:40.341
They really should give 
you your own office.

35:46.574 --> 35:49.504
Evidently, the store clerk has recanted.

35:49.504 --> 35:53.702
He's suddenly not sure
he saw Lee Tyler take the scarf.

35:53.702 --> 35:57.840
–The case might even be dropped.
–It's a great country.

35:58.775 --> 36:01.805
The district attorney has lodged
a complaint against you

36:01.805 --> 36:06.412
for witness tampering, intimidation,
obstruction of justice, extortion.

36:06.412 --> 36:09.548
He should make up his mind.

36:10.662 --> 36:13.817
This firm does not engage
in that kind of conduct, counsel.

36:13.817 --> 36:16.607
We do not intimidate or blackmail.

36:16.607 --> 36:18.988
The attorney sat Crane, 
Poole & Schmidt

36:18.988 --> 36:22.514
conduct themselves 
with integrity always.

36:22.514 --> 36:25.127
Do I make myself clear?

36:25.127 --> 36:27.071
More than clear.

36:27.071 --> 36:29.563
Transparent.

36:31.403 --> 36:33.064
Go.

36:39.682 --> 36:41.164
Mr Shore,

36:43.415 --> 36:45.382
thank you.

37:03.546 --> 37:07.249
Madam Foreperson, the jury 
has reached a unanimous verdict?

37:07.249 --> 37:08.959
We have, your honor.

37:09.387 --> 37:11.913
Mr Litch, please rise.

37:14.032 --> 37:16.727
Madam Foreperson, what say you?

37:16.727 --> 37:17.648
We the jury,

37:17.648 --> 37:21.543
in the matter of the commonwealth of
Massachusetts versus Warren Litch,

37:21.543 --> 37:24.119
on the charge of first-degree murder,

37:24.119 --> 37:28.435
we find the defendant 
Warren Litch guilty.

37:35.254 --> 37:38.791
Members of the jury, I would like to 
thank you for your service in this matter.

37:38.791 --> 37:40.351
You are hereby excused.

37:40.351 --> 37:42.950
Please be sure to sign out
with the courtroom deputy

37:42.950 --> 37:45.223
so you are credited for your time here.

37:45.223 --> 37:48.429
The defendant is to be retained
in county until sentencing,

37:48.429 --> 37:50.906
which shall be scheduled
within 60 days' time.

37:50.906 --> 37:53.979
If that is all, then we are adjourned.

37:54.549 --> 37:56.205
Listen, um,

37:56.205 --> 37:57.986
I'll review any grounds for appeal.

37:57.986 --> 38:00.112
The confession, I mean, 
there are grounds.

38:00.112 --> 38:02.594
Okay. Okay.

38:02.594 --> 38:04.724
I'll be in touch.
I'll order up the transcript.

38:04.724 --> 38:06.825
Listen, um,

38:07.626 --> 38:10.290
I thought for somebody who 
felt the way you felt,

38:10.290 --> 38:13.694
it was honorable for you to 
try your hardest.

38:13.694 --> 38:15.605
And I know that you did.

38:16.453 --> 38:18.303
Thank you.

38:47.563 --> 38:51.794
Unprofessional for me not 
to be prepared with my closing.

38:51.794 --> 38:55.259
I think I'll perhaps go 
back to the hospital,

38:55.259 --> 38:57.766
get a little tune-up.

39:28.587 --> 39:30.746
Surely you're feeling better about things.

39:30.746 --> 39:33.497
I've plied you with alcohol.

39:39.859 --> 39:41.821
I'm sorry.

39:43.048 --> 39:45.364
It suddenly occurred to me, Alan,

39:45.364 --> 39:48.199
you weren't using me at all.

39:48.199 --> 39:50.679
You were using Miles.

39:51.747 --> 39:53.755
How so?

39:54.204 --> 39:55.911
I think…

39:56.826 --> 40:02.453
he was some sort of device for you
to look despicable in my eyes.

40:02.453 --> 40:05.065
It's your pattern with women,

40:05.065 --> 40:07.639
I think, to get them to…

40:09.994 --> 40:12.072
You know when you 
psychoanalyze me,

40:12.072 --> 40:14.521
I find you much less sexually attractive.

40:14.521 --> 40:16.445
Yes, nice deflection, but…

40:16.445 --> 40:18.115
Don't try and get in my head, Sally.

40:18.115 --> 40:20.244
You won't like the mess.

40:25.819 --> 40:28.109
You weren't telling me to 
run from the law the other night.

40:28.109 --> 40:30.576
You were telling me to run from you.

40:30.576 --> 40:33.151
Maybe you think it's my 
relationship with you

40:33.151 --> 40:36.121
that's ultimately dehumanizing.

40:36.121 --> 40:40.309
So being an incredibly decent man,

40:40.309 --> 40:44.815
which you are underneath
all your stuff,

40:44.815 --> 40:47.804
you decided to warn me.

40:52.202 --> 40:55.301
I'm not trying to push you away.

40:55.301 --> 40:57.934
Are you trying to keep me?

40:59.135 --> 41:02.432
We either go forward or
go in opposite direction,

41:02.432 --> 41:06.806
because I don't like 
where we are now.

41:07.425 --> 41:10.759
What forward do you mean?

41:17.941 --> 41:19.830
You know what?

41:20.408 --> 41:24.029
I think I'll just move forward.
