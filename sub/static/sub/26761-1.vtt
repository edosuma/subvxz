Got it.

You're the best friend.

01:18.190 --> 01:19.220
You know this, right?

01:19.220 --> 01:20.053
- A little bit.

01:20.053 --> 01:21.460
That's my thing.

01:21.460 --> 01:22.930
That's my thing, that's what I do.

01:22.930 --> 01:24.147

01:24.147 --> 01:25.390
You don't calm me down?

You're gonna love it.

01:29.650 --> 01:30.901
You haven't been here yet, right?

01:30.901 --> 01:32.710
- I still don't understand why

01:32.710 --> 01:34.880
you have to record everything that you do.

01:34.880 --> 01:37.330
- Because, as you know,
I've worked really hard

01:37.330 --> 01:40.530
at building a following and
my followers like to see me.

01:40.530 --> 01:42.500
- Sounds to me like
you like the attention.

01:42.500 --> 01:45.100
- [Veronica] Oh my God, I feel so much

01:45.100 --> 01:47.140

So I just want you guys to know,

02:04.700 --> 02:08.000
in order to embrace the teacher within,

02:08.000 --> 02:10.250
sometimes you must be a student.

02:10.250 --> 02:11.083
Alright, let's go in.

- When, when?

02:22.813 --> 02:23.646
- Next week.

02:23.646 --> 02:24.570
- Oh my God.

02:24.570 --> 02:25.403
Oh my God.

02:26.796 --> 02:28.590
- I brought a friend, I
brought Demetrius with me.

02:28.590 --> 02:30.100
- Demetrius, hello.

02:30.100 --> 02:31.870
- You don't mind if he records, right?

02:31.870 --> 02:32.703
I told you about--
- Of course not.

02:32.703 --> 02:35.083
I know, yeah.
- Thank you.

02:36.308 --> 02:37.254
- So let's everybody come
to easy pose, seated.

02:37.254 --> 02:39.101
Whatever's comfortable.

02:39.101 --> 02:40.625
If this isn't comfortable, sustainable,

02:40.625 --> 02:41.570
then move around.

02:41.570 --> 02:42.690
Nobody cares.

02:42.690 --> 02:45.000
So come seated, close your eyes.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.970
Sit up nice and calm.

02:46.970 --> 02:50.320
Let your hands fall wherever
they fall in your lap

02:50.320 --> 02:51.630
and let's just come into our breath.

02:51.630 --> 02:52.893
Find your breath.

02:54.410 --> 02:56.770
Listen to it come in.

02:56.770 --> 02:58.143
And listen to it leave.

02:59.580 --> 03:00.700
Feel it come in.

03:00.700 --> 03:01.833
Feel it as it leaves.

03:03.070 --> 03:04.781
I'm glad you came to do this today.

03:04.781 --> 03:05.614
- I know.

03:05.614 --> 03:06.447
- It's nuts.

03:06.447 --> 03:08.073
- You're so sweet, thank you.

03:08.073 --> 03:10.366
- Get you chilled out beforehand.

03:10.366 --> 03:11.199
- I need it.

03:11.199 --> 03:12.032
- Oh my God.

03:12.032 --> 03:13.032
- I need it.

03:18.547 --> 03:20.003
- But I am really hungry.

03:23.230 --> 03:25.223
- I already told you
we're not eating today.

03:25.223 --> 03:26.973
- But I want my chicken nuggets.

03:28.110 --> 03:28.943
- Honestly.

03:30.730 --> 03:31.563
Are you?

03:31.563 --> 03:33.419
You are such a baby.

03:33.419 --> 03:35.504
I can't stand you.

03:35.504 --> 03:36.380
- Well your (mumbling).

03:36.380 --> 03:37.600
- Stop pouting.

03:39.827 --> 03:41.923
You're the worst.

03:41.923 --> 03:42.756
Stop, no.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.089
- Just have some, you'll love them.

03:44.089 --> 03:45.129
They're delicious.

03:45.129 --> 03:46.433
Just have some.

03:46.433 --> 03:48.543
(laughing)

03:48.543 --> 03:50.857

03:50.857 --> 03:52.359
You love 'em, you love 'em.

03:52.359 --> 03:54.520
- Well, guys, that is
another one for the books.

03:54.520 --> 03:59.520
I want to give a special thank
you to my gusband Demetrius.

03:59.827 --> 04:01.600
Best gusband a girl could ever have.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.213
- Ain't that the truth?

04:11.353 --> 04:15.990
- All right, guys, so, I
just want to, I'm feeling it

04:15.990 --> 04:18.940
in my spirit to really talk to you guys,

04:18.940 --> 04:20.380
so you guys can get to know me,

04:20.380 --> 04:22.170
just a little bit more.

04:22.170 --> 04:24.351
I know you see me as one thing.

04:24.351 --> 04:26.960
I come talk to you guys every day,

04:26.960 --> 04:29.840
but I don't know if y'all really know me

04:29.840 --> 04:32.520
like my background, so I just
wanted to put it out there

04:32.520 --> 04:33.930
so you guys will know.

04:33.930 --> 04:36.670
Something that you don't know about me

04:36.670 --> 04:40.430
is that I used to be painfully shy.

04:40.430 --> 04:42.330
Like really, really bad.

04:42.330 --> 04:45.900
And I'm still an introvert,
but I don't know,

04:45.900 --> 04:49.210
just being on social
media and being able to

04:49.210 --> 04:51.310
connect with you guys every day,

04:51.310 --> 04:55.080
being on Facebook, even
yoga has just like really

04:55.080 --> 04:57.240
helped me to come out of my shell.

04:57.240 --> 05:01.350
And I just felt like as
my audience grew more

05:01.350 --> 05:04.560
and as I got more friends and you guys,

05:04.560 --> 05:06.920
of course, I call you my
friends, but as I've gotten

05:06.920 --> 05:09.680
to know you all more, and
just feeling your love

05:09.680 --> 05:14.322
and support, it's just really
made me grow as a person.

05:14.322 --> 05:17.010
And I'm just really grateful for you guys.

05:17.010 --> 05:19.100
I just want to thank you personally from

05:19.100 --> 05:20.750
the bottom of my heart for that.

05:20.750 --> 05:23.580
It really brings me so much joy.

05:23.580 --> 05:26.500
And I'm like eternally grateful.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.830
And so, look, guys.

05:29.830 --> 05:30.863
All right, old man.

05:31.760 --> 05:32.800
Why you moving so slow?

05:32.800 --> 05:34.685
- I ain't old.

05:34.685 --> 05:36.357

05:36.357 --> 05:37.320

05:37.320 --> 05:39.265
- [Veronica] You do look like Carlton.

05:39.265 --> 05:40.098
- Like I'm about to go golfing.

05:40.098 --> 05:41.705
- Do the dance.
- I'm not going

05:41.705 --> 05:42.676
to do the dance.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.698
I won't do the dance.

05:43.698 --> 05:44.531
I won't do it.

05:44.531 --> 05:45.953
Can't stop doing the thing.

05:45.953 --> 05:48.013
I won't do this dance no more.

05:50.764 --> 05:52.767
put these bags in the car?

05:52.767 --> 05:55.130
- I'm trying, but it takes me a little bit

05:55.130 --> 05:56.720
to lift the whole house into a truck.

05:56.720 --> 05:57.553
- [Veronica] Oh my God.

05:57.553 --> 05:59.353
I need everything in that bag, OK?

06:00.450 --> 06:01.283

gonna be thanking me later.

- Am I?
- Yes.

06:06.959 --> 06:08.357

09:04.110 --> 09:05.980
- I'm Anthony, this is my wife, Veronica.

09:05.980 --> 09:07.379
- Nice to meet you.

09:07.379 --> 09:09.223
- Man, the house looked
good in the pictures,

09:09.223 --> 09:11.870
but this, this is stunning.

09:11.870 --> 09:13.479
- Well, she's a beauty.

09:13.479 --> 09:15.220
You're gonna love it.

09:15.220 --> 09:17.220
Let's go inside and have a look.

09:17.220 --> 09:18.053
- OK, that's great.

09:18.053 --> 09:19.396
- Take you long to get here?
- No.

09:19.396 --> 09:20.470
- Oh, wonderful.
- Actually just

09:20.470 --> 09:22.108
a straight shot through.

09:22.108 --> 09:23.390
- Well, as you can see,

09:23.390 --> 09:25.563
this is the glorious entrance right here.

09:26.810 --> 09:28.840
Automatic door lock right here.

09:28.840 --> 09:30.203
Nice feature.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.043
Come on in.

09:32.199 --> 09:34.170
- Front door closed.
- First meet Alex.

09:34.170 --> 09:37.430
The home is fully automated
with a voice activated system

09:37.430 --> 09:40.530
that controls a number
of electronic things.

09:40.530 --> 09:43.180
So if you want to control the lights,

09:43.180 --> 09:45.850
if you want to watch
TV, play a little music,

09:45.850 --> 09:47.892
just go ask Alex.
- I can get used

09:47.892 --> 09:50.200
to living like this.
- Well, I think you're

09:50.200 --> 09:53.181
gonna love the amenities
that this house has to offer.

09:53.181 --> 09:57.860
First things first, I wanted
to show you your sanctuary.

09:57.860 --> 10:00.810
Master bedroom, seating area.

10:00.810 --> 10:02.480
Large screen television.

10:02.480 --> 10:03.673
Of course, king bed.

10:04.540 --> 10:07.863
And it all leads into a
very luxurious bathroom.

10:14.742 --> 10:16.409
- Wow, this is nice.

10:18.390 --> 10:20.503
And the shower has room for two.

10:24.460 --> 10:26.460
- This gourmet kitchen
has everything you need

10:26.460 --> 10:30.203
to prepare a gourmet
meal, except the lobster.

10:31.214 --> 10:33.103
That's on you.

10:33.103 --> 10:33.936
- Oh, right, right.

10:33.936 --> 10:36.110
- I've noticed that you've
been videoing our little tour

10:36.110 --> 10:38.305
so far.
- Yeah, my wife,

10:38.305 --> 10:42.162
she likes to record these things
for social media following

10:42.162 --> 10:43.500
and all that kind of stuff.

10:43.500 --> 10:44.600
- That's fine.

10:44.600 --> 10:48.060
Your phones may not get a good
signal inside of the house.

10:48.060 --> 10:50.790
- At all?
- Well, there is Wi-Fi,

10:50.790 --> 10:52.510
and of course, outside, you should be able

10:52.510 --> 10:54.190
to make a phone call just fine.

10:54.190 --> 10:57.090
- Oh, OK.
- I did want to point out,

10:57.090 --> 11:00.570
also, there's another
security camera here.

11:00.570 --> 11:03.750
And I think this will
make you feel comfortable,

11:03.750 --> 11:05.040
make you feel safe.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.320
- Yeah, I feel safer already.

11:07.320 --> 11:08.153
- Awesome.

11:09.410 --> 11:12.130
Well, you want to go
take a look at something

11:12.130 --> 11:13.739
down the hall I think you'll like.

11:13.739 --> 11:16.156
(chattering)

11:19.029 --> 11:23.424
This I think you're really gonna like.

11:23.424 --> 11:25.227
- Yeah, I like this.

11:25.227 --> 11:27.840
- Complete home gym.
- Think you're gonna

11:27.840 --> 11:30.090
get ripped in a week, baby?

11:31.284 --> 11:32.284
That's a no.

11:33.737 --> 11:36.353
- Hey, I got a good idea,
let me stop you right there.

11:38.300 --> 11:39.840
- OK.
- I should point out,

11:39.840 --> 11:41.550
the owners are in Europe right now,

11:41.550 --> 11:45.367
so these rooms are off limits.

11:45.367 --> 11:48.060
They're not actually part of the rental,

11:48.060 --> 11:50.750
but just so you know, it's nothing up here

11:50.750 --> 11:52.660
but extra bedrooms.

11:52.660 --> 11:56.230
- Gotcha.
- But I will show you

11:56.230 --> 11:58.530
the game room.
- It is quaint, though.

11:58.530 --> 11:59.447
- Yeah, it is.

12:02.038 --> 12:02.871
I will show you the game room.

12:02.871 --> 12:03.807
- Please, after you.

12:05.947 --> 12:08.550
Exercise, watch television.
- That view.

12:08.550 --> 12:11.150
- From here, you have a
beautiful view of the lake.

12:11.150 --> 12:12.567
- [Veronica] Yes.

12:13.595 --> 12:15.000
Oh my God.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.610
I know exactly where I'm
doing my yoga in the morning.

12:17.610 --> 12:19.489
- [Allen] Oh, you said you
were a yoga instructor,

12:19.489 --> 12:20.322
is that right?

12:20.322 --> 12:21.650
- Yeah, I am.
- So you have time

12:21.650 --> 12:24.370
for downward dog and real estate, right?

12:24.370 --> 12:26.573
- [Veronica] I make it work, you know?

12:26.573 --> 12:27.953
- My compliment.
- Thank you.

12:27.953 --> 12:30.504
- This is your own
private oasis, right here.

12:30.504 --> 12:32.143
The pool is heated.

12:33.040 --> 12:35.337
There's a fire pit to the left.

12:35.337 --> 12:38.336
And even have a barbecue
grill for all of your

12:38.336 --> 12:41.306
culinary masterpieces outside.

12:41.306 --> 12:44.570
- Steaks and scrimps,
steaks and scrimps, baby.

12:44.570 --> 12:47.040
- Well, you two should feel blessed.

12:47.040 --> 12:49.490
I didn't have a place like
this for my honeymoon.

12:51.350 --> 12:53.929
- Why not?
- Never was married.

12:53.929 --> 12:56.179
(laughing)

12:58.040 --> 13:01.320
I hope you have a wonderful stay, relax.

13:01.320 --> 13:03.703
It's an absolutely fabulous property.

13:10.700 --> 13:12.380
- Wow.
- Beautiful, isn't it?

13:12.380 --> 13:15.570
- Up close and personal.
- Yes it is.

13:15.570 --> 13:16.853
Have a shaded pergola.

13:17.710 --> 13:19.463
It's beautiful, very relaxing.

13:20.854 --> 13:22.600
- [Veronica] This is so
gorgeous and peaceful.

13:22.600 --> 13:23.850
- [Anthony] This is nice.

13:25.268 --> 13:28.477
This is very nice.
- Honestly, it's so perfect.

13:28.477 --> 13:31.421
- You probably want to get rid of me now.

13:31.421 --> 13:32.380
(laughing)

13:32.380 --> 13:33.930
I just want to mention one other thing.

13:33.930 --> 13:36.210
There is an alarm code for the house.

13:36.210 --> 13:39.093
It's one seven one eight.

13:39.940 --> 13:42.840
It's also the code for
the front door lock.

13:42.840 --> 13:44.450
- OK.
- 1718.

13:44.450 --> 13:45.970
- 1718.
- Perfect.

13:45.970 --> 13:47.400
- Perfect.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.760
- I don't know what else
there is to show you,

13:49.760 --> 13:52.450
I will say that if you want
to visit our little town,

13:52.450 --> 13:57.150
it's very quaint, lots
of shopping, restaurants.

13:57.150 --> 13:59.417
I think there's a festival going on.

13:59.417 --> 14:04.010
Very safe, except for the
occasional troublemaker

14:04.010 --> 14:07.230
that comes through town, but
we have a beautiful beach.

14:07.230 --> 14:09.810
Very private, very relaxing.

14:09.810 --> 14:10.990
So you have lots to choose from.

14:10.990 --> 14:12.700
- [Anthony] Good, good, good.

14:12.700 --> 14:15.023
- You two, enjoy your stay.

14:17.940 --> 14:22.010
- Thanks.
- Front door open.

14:22.010 --> 14:24.446
- Allen was nice.
- Front door closed.

14:24.446 --> 14:26.906
- Very nice and secure.
- And secure.

14:26.906 --> 14:28.726
- And secure.
- I feel safe.

14:28.726 --> 14:31.036
- I don't have any friends, I'm married.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.090
(laughing)

14:32.090 --> 14:33.610
That was kind of interesting.

14:33.610 --> 14:35.230
- I know.
- A lot of cameras

14:35.230 --> 14:39.403
around, though, but they
don't get a shot of,

14:40.253 --> 14:41.503
they don't get.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.997
And they said, "Don't worry, all

14:47.997 --> 14:50.550
"the roller coasters assimilate."

14:50.550 --> 14:52.590
And that turned out to be a lie.

14:52.590 --> 14:56.052
They were not, they were
actually real roller coasters.

14:56.052 --> 14:57.956
We met the devil today.

14:57.956 --> 14:59.524
- We did meet the devil.
- In your town.

14:59.524 --> 15:02.690
Devil brought us home.
- So the devil lives

15:02.690 --> 15:05.000
in a quaint, quiet town off the beach.

15:05.000 --> 15:05.833
- He does.

15:05.833 --> 15:08.270
I did make a deal with the devil,

15:08.270 --> 15:11.470
but I mean, the devil, we got this.

15:11.470 --> 15:12.920
Watch this.

15:12.920 --> 15:13.880
Alex.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.493
Play jazz.

15:16.747 --> 15:18.440
(jazz music)

15:18.440 --> 15:20.005
OK, Alex, stop.

15:20.005 --> 15:21.502
- OK.
- See how that works?

15:21.502 --> 15:22.500
She's happy.

15:22.500 --> 15:23.333
- I am happy.

15:23.333 --> 15:25.400
I can't lie, it's gorgeous.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.220
- It is gorgeous, you're gorgeous.

15:27.220 --> 15:28.530
- Thanks, pup.

15:28.530 --> 15:29.690
He did good, y'all.
- I did good.

15:29.690 --> 15:31.040
- This house is like really dope.

15:31.040 --> 15:31.873
- I did good.

15:33.140 --> 15:33.973
Give myself 10 fives.

15:35.390 --> 15:36.706
(clapping)

15:36.706 --> 15:37.806
That was 10 of 'em.

15:37.806 --> 15:38.639
In case you counted, I know some of y'all

15:38.639 --> 15:39.472
out there counting.

15:39.472 --> 15:41.440
- Anyways, guys, we are exhausted.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.010
We had an amazing day,
but I think we're about

15:44.010 --> 15:45.270
to shut it down.

15:45.270 --> 15:46.330
All right?

15:46.330 --> 15:47.410
You are so weird.

15:47.410 --> 15:49.600
- No I'm not.
- Oh my God.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.380
Can you please go set the alarm?

15:51.380 --> 15:54.853
- I'm going to set it
off is what I'm gonna do.

15:55.755 --> 15:56.588
- [Veronica] What are you talking about?

15:56.588 --> 15:57.870
- Alex.

15:57.870 --> 16:01.543
Play stripper music.
- Alex doesn't have

16:02.632 --> 16:06.092
stripper music.
(bombastic music)

16:06.092 --> 16:09.020
Oh my God, she played it.

16:09.020 --> 16:11.853
- Stripper music.
- Oh my goodness.

16:13.345 --> 16:14.813
Work it.

16:15.840 --> 16:16.673
Of course.

16:17.517 --> 16:19.083
All that magic.

16:21.425 --> 16:22.258
Mmm, ooh.

16:31.810 --> 16:33.040
Yes.

16:33.040 --> 16:36.233
- What is it called?
- I do not know, sorry.

16:38.883 --> 16:40.800
18 something?
- 18 once.

16:41.667 --> 16:42.500
1718.

16:48.500 --> 16:51.301
(beeping)

16:51.301 --> 16:54.551
(low ominous rumbling)

18:03.067 --> 18:07.210
- All right, guys, so we decided
to take a nice little drive

18:07.210 --> 18:11.090
through this really
cute quaint little town.

18:11.090 --> 18:14.090
We're actually just looking
for somewhere good to eat.

18:14.090 --> 18:17.150
- Yes because we have definitely
worked up an appetite.

18:17.150 --> 18:20.476
- We have worked up appetites.

18:20.476 --> 18:22.934
- Appetite, I say appetite.

18:22.934 --> 18:25.106
- I'm personally not gonna go into details

18:25.106 --> 18:26.333
of how all of that.
- You've got to give

18:26.333 --> 18:27.830
some details, baby, that's
the only way you can do it.

18:27.830 --> 18:30.195
- Gloss right on over that.
- It's not right.

18:30.195 --> 18:31.850
Well it's good that, you
know, I brought some of this

18:31.850 --> 18:33.370
camera stuff with me,
then, so that we can get

18:33.370 --> 18:35.993
a lot of it on camera, show 'em, you know,

18:35.993 --> 18:37.317
what we've been up to.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.170
And I also bought, you remember the box

18:39.170 --> 18:41.050
that came to the house the other day?

18:41.050 --> 18:42.990
- I do.
- That, my darling,

18:42.990 --> 18:44.303
was a drone.

18:45.540 --> 18:47.170
So I'm gonna get some aerial
shots and I think that's

18:47.170 --> 18:49.878
gonna look really nice once
we put this thing together.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.130
- I have a confession.

18:51.130 --> 18:54.030
I feel bad now because I thought
you was just buying junk.

18:54.030 --> 18:55.803
And now you're going to use it for me.

18:55.803 --> 18:58.342
- See, it was all for you.

18:58.342 --> 19:00.759
(chattering)

19:13.443 --> 19:15.359
Trying to figure out when
to cross, when not to cross.

19:15.359 --> 19:17.133
- Oh, wow.

19:17.970 --> 19:20.854
- I'm not even looking, hey, hey.

19:20.854 --> 19:22.430
- This place is interesting.

19:22.430 --> 19:24.710
- This place is very interesting.

19:24.710 --> 19:26.750
It's like playing Jenga
getting these glasses

19:26.750 --> 19:27.620
off of here.
- Is it?

19:27.620 --> 19:29.794
- Yep, and I won.
- You've got the most fabulous

19:29.794 --> 19:31.763
glasses that you can.

19:31.763 --> 19:32.596
(laughing)

19:32.596 --> 19:34.200
You look like a rapper from the '80s.

19:34.200 --> 19:36.150
- Check me out, I am, this is good, babe.

19:36.150 --> 19:38.333
I think I should wear
these to sleep tonight.

19:39.262 --> 19:43.038
Because your beauty blinds me,
that's why I would wear them.

19:43.038 --> 19:44.811
- Next to this here.

19:44.811 --> 19:47.167
Take that.
- Got it.

19:47.167 --> 19:48.070
Got it, got it, got it.

19:48.070 --> 19:49.660
They got two heads.

19:49.660 --> 19:51.030
Two heads are better than one.

19:51.030 --> 19:53.030
- Don't start that.
- OK, you right,

19:53.030 --> 19:53.863
you right, you right.

19:53.863 --> 19:54.870
Blue hair right here, too.

19:54.870 --> 19:56.463
Oh, look at her.

19:56.463 --> 19:57.296
She is to die for.

19:57.296 --> 19:58.129
Oh my goodness.

19:58.129 --> 20:00.000
She is to die for.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.451
- That's a nice skirt, actually.

20:01.451 --> 20:02.538
- It's something.
- Here.

20:02.538 --> 20:05.390
Real sexy in them pants, baby.

20:05.390 --> 20:09.097
We should go to like one of
these Victorian type parties

20:09.097 --> 20:09.930
or something, right?

20:09.930 --> 20:12.410
- And do what?
- And wear these clothes.

20:12.410 --> 20:13.303
- You want me?

20:14.749 --> 20:15.582
(laughing)

20:15.582 --> 20:16.663
- [Veronica] No, I'd be the slave.

20:18.102 --> 20:20.369
(laughing)

20:20.369 --> 20:22.786
(chattering)

20:30.918 --> 20:32.501
- Perfect.
- Really?

20:36.529 --> 20:37.946
Babe.
- What's up?

20:40.285 --> 20:42.435
- [Veronica] I think
this guy over here is.

20:43.323 --> 20:44.973
Don't make it obvious.

20:46.106 --> 20:49.574
Tattoos on his neck and the hat.

20:49.574 --> 20:51.991
(chattering)

20:55.050 --> 20:56.633
No, no, no, no, no.

20:58.710 --> 20:59.723
OK, that was creepy.

21:00.815 --> 21:03.513
- That was weird.
- No, uh uh.

21:03.513 --> 21:06.645
OK, I'm freaked out, let's just go.

21:06.645 --> 21:07.905
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I want to get

21:07.905 --> 21:08.913
out of here.

21:08.913 --> 21:09.746
Let's go.

21:11.530 --> 21:12.934
- [Anthony] Maybe they'll
hit me, maybe they won't.

21:12.934 --> 21:13.767
- OK.

21:14.816 --> 21:17.233
(chattering)

21:20.786 --> 21:24.040
- Yeah, I love the structure of this city.

21:24.040 --> 21:26.207
(humming)

21:29.960 --> 21:31.754
- [Veronica] Still love ya.

21:31.754 --> 21:35.421
- Do we know, did we
find out how much that?

21:37.210 --> 21:38.043
A million?

21:38.043 --> 21:38.876
How much?
- 39.

21:38.876 --> 21:40.093
- $40?
- Yep.

21:41.745 --> 21:44.412
- [Veronica] Mm, that ain't bad.

21:49.350 --> 21:50.403
That's real cute.

21:51.392 --> 21:52.598
- I do, I think so.

21:52.598 --> 21:53.530
(chattering)

21:53.530 --> 21:56.725
- [Veronica] I think you
should put that at the bar.

21:56.725 --> 21:57.558
(laughing)

21:57.558 --> 21:58.900
- That's what I was
thinking, that's so funny.

21:58.900 --> 22:01.070
- [Veronica] Babe, babe,
look, is that, the guy

22:01.070 --> 22:02.890
was following us earlier.

22:02.890 --> 22:04.040
I mean, you missed him.

22:04.919 --> 22:06.610
He's freaking me out.

22:06.610 --> 22:09.560
I'm pretty sure I just saw that guy.

22:09.560 --> 22:10.540
From the other store.

22:10.540 --> 22:12.417
- The tattoo guy?
- Yes.

22:12.417 --> 22:14.328
Go check.

22:14.328 --> 22:15.549
Go check.

22:15.549 --> 22:16.704
- He was here?
- I am positive

22:16.704 --> 22:18.204
that was just him.

22:19.253 --> 22:20.874
What should we do?
- Don't worry about it.

22:20.874 --> 22:22.466
- Oh my God, he's getting close,

22:22.466 --> 22:24.381
he's getting real close.

22:24.381 --> 22:25.930
My God, I can't.

22:25.930 --> 22:27.403
Help, help, help me.

22:28.431 --> 22:30.490
Shit, oh my God.

22:30.490 --> 22:32.570
He's like up close.

22:32.570 --> 22:37.200
He is up on the car, he's so fucking bold.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.310
You can't be serious.

22:39.310 --> 22:40.840
What the fuck was that?

22:42.535 --> 22:44.702
(sighing)

22:50.920 --> 22:52.973
- Video journal entry number 148.

22:54.622 --> 22:56.863
I believe I found the next two people.

22:59.780 --> 23:03.943
I lost them for now, but
I will find them again.

23:08.341 --> 23:09.599
- Come on, baby.
- Come on, baby.

23:09.599 --> 23:11.425
- Come on, baby.

23:11.425 --> 23:13.577
(chattering)

23:13.577 --> 23:16.025
- [Veronica] Sorry, baby, next one.

23:16.025 --> 23:17.609
Oh, man.

23:17.609 --> 23:18.442
Oh.

23:19.323 --> 23:21.630
- Got us a blue bear.

23:21.630 --> 23:23.216
She put her money on the blue.

23:23.216 --> 23:25.126
I'm not afraid of a roller coaster.

23:25.126 --> 23:25.959
- You're not?
- No.

23:25.959 --> 23:30.959
It's just that heights sometimes
and I don't agree, right?

23:31.370 --> 23:33.794
So when we don't agree,
and the wind is blowing.

23:33.794 --> 23:35.800
Ahoy, mates.

23:35.800 --> 23:39.683
Here we are aboard the
Anthony Kingslow, eh?

23:40.840 --> 23:42.869
To me is how a pirate sounds.

23:42.869 --> 23:44.630
Ahoy, mate.
- I don't think

23:44.630 --> 23:46.029
that's how the pirates.

23:46.029 --> 23:47.153
- Got to put money in.

23:47.153 --> 23:48.389
They charge you for everything.

23:48.389 --> 23:49.703
- What are you looking at?
- They charge you

23:49.703 --> 23:50.536
for everything.

23:50.536 --> 23:52.671
In the ghetto, this is what
we used to do in the hood.

23:52.671 --> 23:54.270
When we used to get to
this, we just used to look

23:54.270 --> 23:57.757
through the hole, and pretend
that we could see something.

23:57.757 --> 24:00.110
Oh, mama, look, I can
see the ships out there,

24:00.110 --> 24:01.950
but it's really not a ship.

24:01.950 --> 24:04.340
We just looking through
this little hole right here.

24:04.340 --> 24:06.040
Really not focused on nothing.

24:06.040 --> 24:08.780
And we were satisfied, Mama
didn't have to pay her money.

24:08.780 --> 24:10.750
We was good pretenders.

24:10.750 --> 24:11.807
We was good pretenders.

24:13.531 --> 24:14.620
We had fun.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.037
- Give me a kiss.

24:18.337 --> 24:20.570
- I haven't been this way in a long time.

24:20.570 --> 24:22.752
- I've got to catch this sunset, though.

24:22.752 --> 24:25.850
- Work is so stressful
sometimes, look at that.

24:25.850 --> 24:27.680
Isn't that beautiful?
- It so good.

24:27.680 --> 24:28.860
- Amazing.

24:28.860 --> 24:30.073
- [Veronica] Just gorgeous.

24:31.040 --> 24:33.137
- But nowhere near as amazing as you.

24:34.050 --> 24:35.510
- You heard that?

24:35.510 --> 24:36.950
Say it again.

24:36.950 --> 24:39.333
- But nowhere near as amazing as you.

24:40.590 --> 24:41.804
- Love it.

24:41.804 --> 24:43.540
We in this together.
- Are we?

24:43.540 --> 24:45.198
- Through thick and thin.

24:45.198 --> 24:46.400
'Til the end.

24:46.400 --> 24:48.070
- That's not high to you?

24:48.070 --> 24:49.130
- It's not high.

24:49.130 --> 24:50.787
- Oh, that's high to me.
- It's so.

24:50.787 --> 24:51.787
- Oh my God.

24:52.935 --> 24:55.287
Look how, look how fucking
high, look how high this is.

24:55.287 --> 24:56.705
- High.
- This is high.

24:56.705 --> 24:57.538
- It's not that high, babe.

24:57.538 --> 24:58.750
Feeling better?

24:58.750 --> 25:00.471
- Yes.
- Yes.

25:00.471 --> 25:02.127
You're good, I got you.

25:02.127 --> 25:03.793
I always got you.

25:03.793 --> 25:05.690
- OK, we are the ones at the tippy top.

25:05.690 --> 25:08.487
- We're not at the tippy.
- Yeah, it feel like it.

25:10.447 --> 25:12.190
It feel like it.

25:12.190 --> 25:13.190
I can't stop.

25:13.190 --> 25:14.930
- I'm still here with you.

25:14.930 --> 25:15.926
- I can't stop.

25:15.926 --> 25:17.638
- I'm still here with you.
- I can't stop.

25:17.638 --> 25:19.378
I looked down.

25:19.378 --> 25:20.211
She lied, baby.

25:20.211 --> 25:22.269
Was more than seven times.
- You on the ground.

25:22.269 --> 25:23.394
- I'm on the ground.
- You're on the ground, babe.

25:23.394 --> 25:24.311
You did it.

25:39.035 --> 25:41.202
(zooming)

25:52.760 --> 25:54.750
- Hey, what's going on, guys?

25:54.750 --> 25:57.470
Excuse me, I'm still trying
to wake up a little bit.

25:57.470 --> 26:00.360
But we had a long day yesterday.

26:00.360 --> 26:04.923
As you can see, the
queen is still sleeping.

26:06.100 --> 26:08.010
But I figured today I would try

26:08.010 --> 26:10.063
and make her breakfast in bed.

26:13.590 --> 26:15.163
I think I'll treat her right today.

26:29.264 --> 26:32.120
(humming)

26:32.120 --> 26:36.883
Alex, play me some rhythm and blues.

26:38.009 --> 26:42.592
(R and B music with indistinct vocals)

26:55.864 --> 26:58.281
(chattering)

27:18.370 --> 27:20.780
- Hey, good morning, guys.

27:20.780 --> 27:23.323
I am just waking up.

27:24.430 --> 27:26.160
This beautiful bed.

27:26.160 --> 27:27.990
I slept so well last night.

27:27.990 --> 27:28.823
Let me tell you.

27:28.823 --> 27:31.366
You like my new yoga outfit?

27:31.366 --> 27:33.527
I got this cute little outfit.

27:33.527 --> 27:34.360
Oh.

27:35.230 --> 27:38.304
Mm.
- Something so delicious.

27:38.304 --> 27:40.869
- That smells good.
- It is.

27:40.869 --> 27:41.702
- What is this?

27:41.702 --> 27:44.284
Hey, y'all, look at this meal.

27:44.284 --> 27:46.040
Baby getting down there cooking.

27:46.040 --> 27:47.190
- Told you so.

27:47.190 --> 27:48.883
I told you so.

27:48.883 --> 27:51.706
I burned in the kitchen.

27:51.706 --> 27:53.591
(laughing)

27:53.591 --> 27:56.451
- What is this?
- It is a,

27:56.451 --> 27:57.860
I picked it out.

27:57.860 --> 27:59.430
Good wealth.

27:59.430 --> 28:00.500
You're supposed to wear
it around your neck.

28:00.500 --> 28:02.350
- Oh, OK, like a necklace.

28:02.350 --> 28:06.475
I actually went you to
come to yoga with me today.

28:06.475 --> 28:10.570
Bae is gonna come do yoga with me today.

28:10.570 --> 28:12.110
By the lake.

28:12.110 --> 28:13.710
Because it's gorgeous outside

28:13.710 --> 28:15.470
and he wants to get healthy.

28:15.470 --> 28:16.730
- We'll get healthy.

28:16.730 --> 28:17.700
Very healthy.

28:19.076 --> 28:22.580
- OK, see, OK, you're taking
this to something else.

28:22.580 --> 28:24.830
(laughing)

28:31.270 --> 28:33.120
Good morning.

28:33.120 --> 28:35.471
Thank you for joining me today.

28:35.471 --> 28:37.690
As you can see, I have
a very special guest,

28:37.690 --> 28:39.870
my new hubby, Anthony.

28:39.870 --> 28:40.703
- Hi.

28:41.570 --> 28:43.490
- Inhaling.

28:43.490 --> 28:44.323
Deeply.

28:47.500 --> 28:49.810
Your own level of comfort, OK?

28:49.810 --> 28:52.240
So don't feel like you
have to do too much.

28:52.240 --> 28:53.840
Don't feel like you have to keep up.

28:53.840 --> 28:55.873
We're all going at our own pace, OK?

28:56.950 --> 28:58.050
All right.

28:58.050 --> 28:59.398
And just make sure that you have

28:59.398 --> 29:00.930
a very beautiful week, guys.

29:00.930 --> 29:01.763
Namaste.

29:04.250 --> 29:05.360
- Is that the door bell?

29:05.360 --> 29:06.343
- I think so.

29:07.201 --> 29:08.793
- You expecting someone?

29:08.793 --> 29:11.687
- No, you don't think the
tattoo guy followed you, do you?

29:14.349 --> 29:16.766
(chattering)

29:25.582 --> 29:28.499
- Who is it?
- I'm Rachael Schaefer.

29:29.940 --> 29:31.764
- Some white woman.

29:31.764 --> 29:33.600
- Good morning.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.540
I'm Rachael Schaefer, I'm
living down the street

29:35.540 --> 29:37.760
and I heard Allen was
renting out the house,

29:37.760 --> 29:41.070
so I wanted to come by and say hello.

29:41.070 --> 29:44.320
- Hi.
- Hey, how are you?

29:44.320 --> 29:46.980
- Is that for us?
- Oh, yes, yes.

29:46.980 --> 29:47.893
If you don't mind.

29:49.270 --> 29:52.930
So, Allen told me that
you are on your honeymoon.

29:52.930 --> 29:53.763
- Yeah.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.793
- I think it is so precious.

29:59.190 --> 30:00.600
Are you planning to have babies

30:00.600 --> 30:02.113
or are you pregnant already?

30:03.320 --> 30:05.560
- I mean, yeah, we do plan on having kids,

30:05.560 --> 30:06.970
just not right now.

30:06.970 --> 30:08.423
- But how you like the house?

30:10.230 --> 30:11.230
- It's nice.

30:11.230 --> 30:13.130
It's really nice.

30:13.130 --> 30:14.685
- It's a very beautiful home.

30:14.685 --> 30:17.570
I'm sorry, who did you say you are again?

30:17.570 --> 30:20.473
- I'm Rachael Shaefer, I'm
living down the street.

30:21.650 --> 30:24.110
But I'm telling you, all the
renters here in this house,

30:24.110 --> 30:27.483
they always have a great,
exciting time, yeah.

30:28.490 --> 30:32.240
So, but anyway, I brought
you something to munch on

30:32.240 --> 30:36.457
and don't be bashful
if you need something.

30:41.758 --> 30:44.172
- That was so weird.
- What the hell?

30:44.172 --> 30:46.971
Don't be bashful if you need something.

30:46.971 --> 30:47.910
- I'm about to slap her in her face.

30:47.910 --> 30:50.205
- Don't slap her, baby.
- Touch my man, come on.

30:50.205 --> 30:51.341
- Hey, no, wait a minute.

30:51.341 --> 30:52.250
Don't slap her.

30:52.250 --> 30:54.270
Pinch her, don't slap her.

30:58.550 --> 31:01.983
- So, as you all know, I
am all about reflecting

31:01.983 --> 31:06.830
and really focusing in on
things that make me grateful.

31:06.830 --> 31:08.630
And I just want to encourage you all

31:08.630 --> 31:10.320
to work hard at it, too.

31:10.320 --> 31:12.120
It doesn't matter your circumstances

31:12.120 --> 31:16.900
or where you come from, you
can really achieve greatness,

31:16.900 --> 31:19.165
but you just have to
reflect and look inside.

31:19.165 --> 31:21.520
(knocking)

31:21.520 --> 31:22.363
Anthony?

31:23.900 --> 31:25.550
Is that you?

31:25.550 --> 31:27.800
(knocking)

31:30.540 --> 31:31.373
Anthony.

31:33.141 --> 31:35.142
I swear, if that man is messing with me.

31:35.142 --> 31:37.392
(knocking)

31:59.023 --> 32:01.713
- Rachael alone at the door.
- Mother fucker.

32:01.713 --> 32:02.546
Oh my God.

32:03.689 --> 32:04.930
That is not funny, Anthony.
- Hey, you say it,

32:04.930 --> 32:07.070
you can't be salty, you
got to leave that to me.

32:07.070 --> 32:08.592
I'm just saying now.

32:08.592 --> 32:10.698
(laughing)

32:10.698 --> 32:12.273
You turned a whole nother color.

32:14.454 --> 32:16.294
- You scared me so bad.
- That was funny.

32:16.294 --> 32:18.238
- That was not funny, no it's not funny.

32:18.238 --> 32:19.694
Don't make me kick your ass.

32:19.694 --> 32:21.210
You're gonna make me kick your ass.

32:21.210 --> 32:22.043
- [Anthony] What would Jesus do?

32:22.043 --> 32:24.100
- What would I do when I kick your ass?

32:24.100 --> 32:26.640
It's not funny to me, for real.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.349
- I'm just saying.

32:28.349 --> 32:31.320
That was by far the funniest
thing that I've seen.

32:31.320 --> 32:32.543
- Hilarious.
- Back door open.

32:36.700 --> 32:38.970
- Look, it wasn't me, I swear.

32:38.970 --> 32:40.590
I'm serious.
- You really got to stop.

32:40.590 --> 32:42.333
- It wasn't me.

33:07.437 --> 33:08.270
Nothing.

33:11.693 --> 33:14.136
- [Computer] Back door closed.

33:14.136 --> 33:15.489
(laughing)

33:15.489 --> 33:17.406
OK, I see what this is.

33:18.637 --> 33:20.250
This is you getting me back, right?

33:20.250 --> 33:22.003
- [Computer] Back door open.

33:24.208 --> 33:25.625
Back door closed.

33:26.900 --> 33:29.288
- I'm leaving.
- No, no, no, wait.

33:29.288 --> 33:31.150
It was the wind.

33:31.150 --> 33:32.760
But that first one was you.

33:32.760 --> 33:33.610
The first one was you.

33:33.610 --> 33:35.170
No, it had to have been you.

33:35.170 --> 33:37.367
The door does not open by itself.

33:38.460 --> 33:40.703
I've been on this Earth for 139 years.

33:56.826 --> 33:59.243
- Did you turn the lights on?

34:02.300 --> 34:03.133
- Alex.

34:04.080 --> 34:05.513
Cut off the bedroom lights.

34:07.880 --> 34:10.553
Alex, cut off the bedroom lights.

34:18.477 --> 34:20.060
This fucking house.

34:41.393 --> 34:43.930
- Good morning everyone.

34:43.930 --> 34:46.710
Usually I would do yoga by
the pool in the morning,

34:46.710 --> 34:51.050
but today I just feel
like lounging by the pool.

34:51.050 --> 34:52.803
Got my cute little bikini on.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.987
It is so peaceful and beautiful out.

35:14.481 --> 35:17.148
(ominous music)

35:27.665 --> 35:28.498
Hello?

35:34.097 --> 35:35.391
Hey, hon.
- What's going on?

35:35.391 --> 35:37.300
I got your food, it's in the kitchen.

35:37.300 --> 35:39.193
- Thanks, but there was this lady.

35:40.250 --> 35:42.990
Who was watching me, so weird.

35:42.990 --> 35:44.470
- What?
- Some lady

35:44.470 --> 35:45.720
was over there watching me.

35:45.720 --> 35:47.603
- Watching you?
- Yes, watching me.

35:49.318 --> 35:51.150
- Maybe she a lesbian.

35:51.150 --> 35:52.510
I'm just saying.

35:52.510 --> 35:54.390
Look, I told you about my
aunt who got that weird

35:54.390 --> 35:58.910
back ass yard that you know
the bald headed, the one,

35:58.910 --> 36:00.510
with the Joe Dirt, that hang out.

36:00.510 --> 36:02.827
I told you about my aunt
who got that weird ass

36:02.827 --> 36:04.920
backyard neighbor who watch.

36:04.920 --> 36:07.920
I'm saying, bees attract honey,
that's all I'm saying, baby.

36:11.890 --> 36:15.047
- This orange juice?
- It is all the way live.

36:15.047 --> 36:16.712
- It's popping.
- I can appreciate

36:16.712 --> 36:18.718
everything about it.

36:18.718 --> 36:20.980
Oh, this actually does have big.

36:20.980 --> 36:24.397
I don't like the way it looks,
so I'm gonna use this one.

36:28.006 --> 36:29.263
- What?

36:29.263 --> 36:32.180
What happened?
- I don't know.

36:32.180 --> 36:34.793
Alex, keep playing music.

36:38.400 --> 36:40.513
- Alex, play music.

36:42.120 --> 36:44.330
- Oh my God, are you serious?

36:44.330 --> 36:46.490
- I thought this place was
supposed to be so high end.

36:46.490 --> 36:48.493
- I thought the same thing.

36:49.350 --> 36:52.042
Maybe Ronnie use your wife on the voice.

36:52.042 --> 36:55.789
- Alex, play music.

36:55.789 --> 36:58.470
- No, no, no, no, she was
more like Alex, play music.

36:58.470 --> 37:00.158
- Alex, play the music.

37:00.158 --> 37:01.690
(laughing)

37:01.690 --> 37:05.410
Play the damn music, bitch, OK?

37:05.410 --> 37:08.163
Sick of that.
- Alex, play the music.

37:09.179 --> 37:10.852
(doorbell ringing)

37:10.852 --> 37:11.843
- Seriously?
- Can you see who

37:11.843 --> 37:15.320
that is while I try to figure
out what's going on here?

37:15.320 --> 37:16.370
- Just trying to eat.

37:17.310 --> 37:19.863
Goodness.
- Alex, play music.

37:20.865 --> 37:22.383
Ooh, Alex, watch Veronica.

37:27.205 --> 37:28.187
- Front door open.
- Hi.

37:28.187 --> 37:31.050
- Hi, hi, I'm James, we, this is Susan,

37:31.050 --> 37:34.590
we live just down the,
wow, I've got to tell ya.

37:34.590 --> 37:37.280
I always wanted to know what
it looked like inside here.

37:37.280 --> 37:38.770
- OK.
- This is incredible.

37:38.770 --> 37:40.299
I'm so jealous.

37:40.299 --> 37:43.200
- So, we're huge fans
and we love watching you

37:43.200 --> 37:45.680
while you do yoga.
- Thank you.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.958
- I do yoga while I watch you, as well.

37:47.958 --> 37:49.528
I'm always watching you.

37:49.528 --> 37:51.660
- She's better at it than
I am, but what can I do?

37:51.660 --> 37:53.500
- OK.
- I'm sorry, this is rude.

37:53.500 --> 37:55.090
This is for you.

37:55.090 --> 37:56.013
- Oh, no, you didn't
have to get me anything.

37:56.013 --> 37:58.736
- Oh, no, please, I insist.
- It's for you.

37:58.736 --> 38:01.807
We really want you to like it.

38:01.807 --> 38:04.377
- I hope you like it.
- Are you gonna be

38:04.377 --> 38:07.510
going live later?
- I understand.

38:07.510 --> 38:10.011
I understand--
- Just like a personal thing

38:10.011 --> 38:10.844
for my--
- No, no.

38:10.844 --> 38:12.369
Embarrassing.
- I'm so sorry.

38:12.369 --> 38:13.788
- No, no, no, don't.
- And we're on our

38:13.788 --> 38:15.082
honeymoon, so it's just, you know.

38:15.082 --> 38:16.720
- We just wanted you to maybe watch us

38:16.720 --> 38:18.590
while we watched you or something.

38:18.590 --> 38:21.450
- Well, I really want to
thank you guys for your gifts.

38:21.450 --> 38:24.000
So if you don't mind, I'd
just like to get back to.

38:24.000 --> 38:25.200
- We can have breakfast.

38:26.136 --> 38:28.620
- I'd love to see you around town later.

38:28.620 --> 38:30.330
But if you don't.
- Oh, OK.

38:30.330 --> 38:32.250
- No, they're right, we should
go, we should really go.

38:32.250 --> 38:33.900
- It was very lovely to meet you guys.

38:33.900 --> 38:36.900
- Will you be on later?
- I will be, yes.

38:36.900 --> 38:38.460
- That's great.
- We'll be watching you.

38:38.460 --> 38:39.850
- Thank you so much.

38:39.850 --> 38:42.950
It was lovely meeting you guys
and I appreciate the gift.

38:42.950 --> 38:44.987
- Always watching Veronica Jackson.

38:44.987 --> 38:47.404
- [Computer] Front door open.

38:51.188 --> 38:53.038
Front door closed.

38:53.038 --> 38:54.288
- What is that?

38:55.496 --> 38:56.746
- I don't know.

38:58.190 --> 39:00.350
We got another gift.

39:00.350 --> 39:02.023
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

39:02.980 --> 39:05.290
- Where, who this come from?

39:05.290 --> 39:09.677
- Some neighbors, who apparently
watch my yoga channel.

39:09.677 --> 39:12.300
- This is, this is--
- Weird.

39:12.300 --> 39:14.110
- Very, but what?

39:14.110 --> 39:16.220
I don't understand, what
are these supposed to be,

39:16.220 --> 39:17.670
like little brat dolls?

39:17.670 --> 39:19.713
- I think they're supposed to be me.

39:20.565 --> 39:21.969
But I'm not sure.

39:21.969 --> 39:23.654
- Except it's got the whole,
the head thing is not.

39:23.654 --> 39:25.234
I don't understand that.

39:25.234 --> 39:27.208
I don't understand, why is
the black doll at the bottom?

39:27.208 --> 39:28.438
I just want to talk about it.

39:28.438 --> 39:29.528
- Is that what?
- No, I got to talk

39:29.528 --> 39:30.361
about this.
- Out of this whole gift,

39:30.361 --> 39:32.104
that's what you got?
- I got to record this,

39:32.104 --> 39:33.686
because this is not gonna work.

39:33.686 --> 39:34.640
Yeah, look.
- I'm gonna let you

39:34.640 --> 39:37.302
handle that because
that's creeping me out.

39:37.302 --> 39:39.210
And it's actually really not funny.

39:39.210 --> 39:43.000
- OK, well, I apologize.
- Go burn it.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.313
- Well, I'm gonna set this over here.

39:46.385 --> 39:49.550
So that way we can enjoy our meal.

39:52.060 --> 39:53.090
- [Veronica] Didn't you
get the music to work?

39:53.090 --> 39:55.337
What is going on?
- I honestly did not.

40:19.440 --> 40:21.653
- Video journal entry number 146.

40:24.520 --> 40:27.603
Previous missing persons
case, Martinez family.

40:29.676 --> 40:33.433
I believe I found the right new bud.

40:34.920 --> 40:35.773
Is it possible?

40:37.950 --> 40:39.600
Next step to find Allen Croswell.

41:00.892 --> 41:01.892
- Excuse me.

41:03.798 --> 41:06.150
What are you doing here?

41:06.150 --> 41:07.750
Don't record me with that thing.

41:10.590 --> 41:14.523
How did you get in here?
- Through the entrance.

41:15.750 --> 41:18.900
- Smart ass.
- I'm looking to buy a house,

41:18.900 --> 41:21.000
was thinking of moving here.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.800
- None of these houses are for sale.

41:24.020 --> 41:25.003
You're trespassing.

41:27.157 --> 41:29.703
You have no idea what
you are fucking with.

41:30.850 --> 41:35.577
So if I were you, I
would get back in my SUV,

41:37.050 --> 41:40.720
and then drive the fuck out.
- Are you Allen Crosby?

41:50.070 --> 41:54.520
- You have a five seconds
to get the fuck out

41:54.520 --> 41:57.003
of this neighborhood.
- Or what?

41:59.830 --> 42:02.233
- Or you won't like what comes next.

42:05.670 --> 42:07.420
- [Diego] You know, you're right.

42:07.420 --> 42:09.423
I wouldn't want to live
in this neighborhood.

42:10.486 --> 42:11.793
People here don't seem too friendly.

42:14.778 --> 42:15.611
- Hey, hey.

42:17.494 --> 42:20.873
Didn't you people used to
cut each other's hearts out?

42:22.300 --> 42:23.650
- [Diego] Only our enemies.

42:59.486 --> 43:02.236
(dramatic sting)

43:07.458 --> 43:09.875
(applauding)

43:14.460 --> 43:17.250
- Lady with the neon.
- Lady with the neon.

43:18.171 --> 43:21.143
- OK, now ladies and gentlemen,
I'm gonna need a volunteer.

43:22.779 --> 43:24.720
Lady with the neon.

43:24.720 --> 43:26.122
(laughing)

43:26.122 --> 43:28.970
- That is you, that is you.

43:28.970 --> 43:32.400
- Now, Miss Veronica, can
you please hand your purse

43:32.400 --> 43:35.010
to my extremely tall assistant?

43:35.010 --> 43:36.373
- I can do that.

43:38.430 --> 43:40.167
- Thank you.
- OK, now,

43:40.167 --> 43:43.410
what I want you to do is
give me five spins around.

43:43.410 --> 43:45.603
- Five, all right.

43:45.603 --> 43:47.655
One.
- Everybody.

43:47.655 --> 43:51.770
- [Crowd] Two, three, four, five.

43:51.770 --> 43:53.420
- Did I do that all right?

43:53.420 --> 43:56.603
- Now, I will put you in a trance.

43:57.850 --> 44:00.680
You are going into a trance.

44:00.680 --> 44:04.020
You are going into a trance.

44:04.020 --> 44:08.863
Now Veronica, you will kiss
my extremely tall assistant.

44:10.946 --> 44:15.315
- [Anthony] I don't think
we're gonna do that part.

44:15.315 --> 44:17.031
(laughing)

44:17.031 --> 44:19.331
- Come on.
- It was a nice try.

44:19.331 --> 44:22.211
- Doesn't work for everybody.
- Not everybody.

44:22.211 --> 44:23.495
- Give her a round of applause.

44:23.495 --> 44:24.569
(applauding)

44:24.569 --> 44:25.868
- Thank you, thank you.

44:25.868 --> 44:27.091
(laughing)

44:27.091 --> 44:28.331
Thanks.

44:28.331 --> 44:32.270
OK, can I get my bag?
- That was amazing.

44:32.270 --> 44:33.807
High five, bag.
- Told you.

44:34.690 --> 44:36.258
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

44:36.258 --> 44:37.848
Told you.
- We are live

44:37.848 --> 44:40.380
and she just got sort of hypnotized.

44:40.380 --> 44:42.850
- No I didn't, your girl
didn't get hypnotized.

44:42.850 --> 44:45.686
- It was an almost hypnotized.

44:45.686 --> 44:48.100
But I didn't like the part
where he tried to kiss her

44:48.100 --> 44:49.883
because I don't know where his lips been.

44:53.897 --> 44:56.314
(chattering)

44:59.310 --> 45:01.296
This is amazing.

45:01.296 --> 45:02.150
Gonna be amazing.

45:02.150 --> 45:05.320
Can you see this?
- Got it.

45:05.320 --> 45:06.443
- Beer cream.

45:06.443 --> 45:10.530
It's the best cream to ever exist.

45:10.530 --> 45:12.570
I have the beard of the natural gods,

45:12.570 --> 45:13.813
the original gods.

45:15.295 --> 45:16.490
- One more.

45:16.490 --> 45:17.888
That's so rude.

45:17.888 --> 45:19.930
All right, guys, we're
gonna enjoy this ice cream.

45:19.930 --> 45:21.536
- We gonna enjoy this.

45:21.536 --> 45:24.600
We gonna enjoy all of this ice cream.

45:24.600 --> 45:25.610
I know.
- That had me

45:25.610 --> 45:27.475
cracking up the whole time.

45:27.475 --> 45:28.810
But the part where he
had that lady up there

45:28.810 --> 45:31.460
doing the chicken, thinking
she was a farm animal.

45:31.460 --> 45:32.980
- She sounded a mess.

45:32.980 --> 45:35.907
I shouldn't have, I'm happy
I went up there, though.

45:35.907 --> 45:38.099
- I'm glad you did, too,
because you looked good.

45:38.099 --> 45:39.240
You looked good, and you had fun.

45:39.240 --> 45:40.900
So I'm glad you had fun.

45:40.900 --> 45:43.680
Because that's why we
are here, to have fun.

45:43.680 --> 45:44.737
My little (foreign language spoken).

45:46.096 --> 45:47.290
- I don't have my wallet.

45:47.290 --> 45:49.150
- What?
- Here, hold this real quick.

45:49.150 --> 45:50.440
What's wrong, what
happened, what do you mean?

45:50.440 --> 45:52.948
- I can't, my wallet's gone.
- I don't understand.

45:52.948 --> 45:55.338
When's the last time you had it?

45:55.338 --> 45:56.600
- Hold on, we were at that restaurant.

45:56.600 --> 45:58.663
Before we saw those guys perform.

46:00.050 --> 46:01.033
- [Anthony] What, what's wrong?

46:02.160 --> 46:04.980
- That little shit from
the street performance

46:04.980 --> 46:06.770
took my wallet.

46:06.770 --> 46:09.410
They took my fucking wallet.

46:09.410 --> 46:11.295
I put my purse down, they took it off

46:11.295 --> 46:12.553
and they took my wallet.

46:12.553 --> 46:14.596
No, no, we're going back to go find 'em.

46:14.596 --> 46:16.526
Come on, Anthony, get out the car.

46:16.526 --> 46:18.410
Come on, right now.

46:21.952 --> 46:23.960
- Uh uh, hold on, babe,
I'm gonna record this

46:23.960 --> 46:25.620
because I don't do nothing with the police

46:25.620 --> 46:26.453
without recording it.

46:26.453 --> 46:27.286
- Excuse me.

46:30.202 --> 46:32.955
There was two guys over
here performing earlier

46:32.955 --> 46:35.803
and I think they stole my wallet.

46:37.230 --> 46:39.030
- Can you describe these two men for me?

46:39.030 --> 46:41.100
- Yeah, I think they were both Hispanic.

46:41.100 --> 46:43.230
One was about five nine and the other one,

46:43.230 --> 46:44.363
he was smaller.

46:45.678 --> 46:47.144
- A midget?

46:47.144 --> 46:48.848
(laughing)

46:48.848 --> 46:49.690
- Could be five feet.

46:49.690 --> 46:51.890
- OK, well, if we find the
guys that fit your description,

46:51.890 --> 46:54.260
we'll definitely question
them about your wallet.

46:54.260 --> 46:56.060
- Well, they're just gonna lie
and say they didn't take it.

46:56.060 --> 46:57.040
- Well, here's my card.

46:57.040 --> 46:59.323
If anything else happens,
just give us a call.

47:00.435 --> 47:02.780
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

47:02.780 --> 47:05.063
- Thanks.
- Officer token.

47:06.910 --> 47:07.810
- No fucking help.

47:20.669 --> 47:23.086
- [Computer] Front door open.

47:39.560 --> 47:41.077
- You want anything?
- No.

47:45.780 --> 47:46.613
- Thirsty?

47:53.750 --> 47:54.583
Sure?

47:56.860 --> 47:59.342
I could get in here and--

47:59.342 --> 48:00.842
- I'm ready to go.

48:02.100 --> 48:03.880
- Veronica, look.
- I'm ready to go.

48:03.880 --> 48:06.963
- Look, I understand, I
know how you probably feel.

48:08.270 --> 48:11.573
But listen, we're on our honeymoon, OK?

48:12.570 --> 48:15.217
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

48:16.682 --> 48:19.930
Don't do that, OK?

48:19.930 --> 48:20.763
Look at me.

48:23.040 --> 48:25.990
Look, it will always be good
as long as we have each other.

48:27.830 --> 48:29.073
Now we have each other.

48:30.992 --> 48:32.492
Now you with me or against me?

48:35.160 --> 48:37.493
You with me or against me?

48:41.800 --> 48:45.150
Well, it really doesn't
matter because now I have you.

48:45.150 --> 48:46.653
Either way you like.

48:47.600 --> 48:49.080
So.

48:49.080 --> 48:51.793
Let's try to make the
best of this, please?

48:53.520 --> 48:54.407
Pretty please?

48:57.821 --> 48:59.533
- I'm gonna go look some
stuff up real quick.

49:04.650 --> 49:06.526
I'll be right back.

49:06.526 --> 49:07.500
- OK.

49:07.500 --> 49:08.810
I'll be right here.

49:08.810 --> 49:11.227
Waiting for you to come back.

49:15.490 --> 49:17.513
Hey, what's going on, babe?

49:17.513 --> 49:19.521
- Hey, babe.
- You're not working, are you?

49:19.521 --> 49:22.289
- [Veronica] No, just
doing a little research.

49:22.289 --> 49:23.631
- Research?

49:23.631 --> 49:25.031
- Yeah.
- Research on what?

49:25.990 --> 49:27.770
- This house.

49:27.770 --> 49:29.300
This neighborhood.

49:29.300 --> 49:30.350
Just this whole town.

49:32.426 --> 49:35.060
- I was just playing with you, but hey,

49:35.060 --> 49:37.947
let me know if you find somebody
that died in this house.

49:37.947 --> 49:40.280
- Will do, babe.
- Thank you.

49:48.170 --> 49:51.293
Don't work too hard, stay up all night.

49:52.840 --> 49:54.537
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

50:01.940 --> 50:02.773
Hey you.

50:05.444 --> 50:07.803
Did you find out anything?

50:08.690 --> 50:09.703
- Not really.

50:10.890 --> 50:12.753
Just like stuff.

50:12.753 --> 50:15.710
- Like what?
- Just like this

50:15.710 --> 50:18.403
entire gated community is
owned by the same company.

50:19.450 --> 50:23.000
- Well, I guess so, that's not that weird.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.450
Allen did say he represented
the whole community.

50:26.290 --> 50:28.033
- Yeah, I guess.

50:30.230 --> 50:31.133
- Going swimming?

50:32.265 --> 50:33.493
- Yes.

50:34.606 --> 50:36.304
(laughing)

50:36.304 --> 50:37.137
- OK.

50:37.137 --> 50:38.760
- I just had to clear my head.

50:38.760 --> 50:41.370
- Yeah, OK.

50:41.370 --> 50:43.137
Well, I'll see you in a second.

50:51.300 --> 50:54.943
- I am about to test out
this gorgeous pool tonight.

50:56.450 --> 50:57.950
You're jealous aren't you?

50:57.950 --> 50:58.783
You should be.

51:26.871 --> 51:31.260
Good morning again, and welcome
back to yoga with Veronica.

51:31.260 --> 51:35.870
So, we are going to
focus, fall as they may.

51:35.870 --> 51:39.250
I want you to close your
eyes and just imagine that.

51:39.250 --> 51:41.690
So we're gonna cat cow.

51:41.690 --> 51:43.640
Deep stretch.

51:43.640 --> 51:45.637
And then release that back out.

51:47.574 --> 51:50.241
(ominous music)

52:30.930 --> 52:32.610
Hi guys.

52:32.610 --> 52:37.610
I am taking a nice, hot,
relaxing bubble bath, as you see.

52:37.720 --> 52:41.190
So I want to encourage
you all to find time

52:41.190 --> 52:45.190
to just treat yourself and I don't know,

52:45.190 --> 52:47.730
just take time to reflect.

52:47.730 --> 52:49.400
And unwind.

52:49.400 --> 52:52.260
And take a relaxing moment to yourself.

52:52.260 --> 52:54.882
So I'm gonna sit back
here and enjoy this bath

52:54.882 --> 52:57.549
and I'll talk to you guys later.

53:04.100 --> 53:06.433
(breathing)

53:17.730 --> 53:19.897
(buzzing)

53:33.710 --> 53:36.127
(chattering)

53:40.257 --> 53:43.840
(music cutting in and out)

54:14.165 --> 54:15.498
Alex, music off.

54:17.330 --> 54:18.163
Music off.

54:20.461 --> 54:21.294
Alex.

54:22.213 --> 54:23.851
Anthony?

54:23.851 --> 54:27.018
Anthony are you back?
- Back door open.

54:39.006 --> 54:42.035
- Anthony are you back?
- Hello, please stay

54:42.035 --> 54:44.202
on the line for.
- Anthony?

54:46.442 --> 54:49.011
Anthony, this isn't funny.

54:49.011 --> 54:49.844
Anthony.

54:58.169 --> 55:01.930
- Hey, Anthony, you enjoying the sun?

55:01.930 --> 55:05.093
- Yeah, a little bit, just
trying to get back into shape.

55:06.490 --> 55:09.308
- I hear that, that is always a struggle.

55:09.308 --> 55:11.720
Hey, do me a favor.

55:11.720 --> 55:15.270
If you happen to see any
sketchy, undesirable characters

55:15.270 --> 55:17.193
out here, would you let me know?

55:18.080 --> 55:19.690
- Undesirables.

55:19.690 --> 55:20.840
What do you mean?

55:20.840 --> 55:22.370
- So.

55:22.370 --> 55:24.862
How's your stay been so far?

55:24.862 --> 55:28.200
- Well, hasn't been dull,
I can tell you that much,

55:28.200 --> 55:30.824
but a few bumps here and there.

55:30.824 --> 55:32.220
- Well, now that is marriage.

55:32.220 --> 55:34.400
That's what I'm talking about, man.

55:34.400 --> 55:37.290
It's up, it's down, it's like some kind of

55:37.290 --> 55:38.673
crazy roller coaster.

55:39.612 --> 55:40.530
(laughing)

55:40.530 --> 55:44.750
- Yeah, well, I'm not much of
a fan of roller coasters, so.

55:44.750 --> 55:47.719
- That's why they have us say our vows.

55:47.719 --> 55:50.940
Til death do us part, all of that?

55:50.940 --> 55:52.886
(laughing)

55:52.886 --> 55:53.719
- Right, right.

55:53.719 --> 55:54.890
- So, I have to ask.

55:54.890 --> 55:59.049
What is that little helicopter
thing like a remote control?

55:59.049 --> 56:01.100
- Oh, it's actually a drone.

56:01.100 --> 56:03.610
Yeah, it records at high
altitudes and follows you

56:03.610 --> 56:04.980
by remote.

56:04.980 --> 56:06.630
- Damn.

56:06.630 --> 56:09.811
All this technology is
officially over my head.

56:09.811 --> 56:11.020
- Yeah.

56:11.020 --> 56:12.710
- Hey, you have a great day, man.

56:12.710 --> 56:13.810
I got to get going.

56:13.810 --> 56:15.246
- Thanks.
- Take it easy.

56:15.246 --> 56:16.079
- You too.

56:29.941 --> 56:31.762
- [Computer] Front door open.

56:31.762 --> 56:33.883
- I want to get the hell out of here.

56:33.883 --> 56:35.639
- Front door closed.
- What's going on?

56:35.639 --> 56:36.530
What happened?

56:36.530 --> 56:40.447
- Did you just come in
here a few minutes ago?

56:40.447 --> 56:41.847
- No, no, no, baby, I was outside.

56:41.847 --> 56:44.369
What's the problem, what's wrong?

56:44.369 --> 56:46.286
- I don't like it here.

56:47.332 --> 56:48.672
- What happened?

56:48.672 --> 56:52.193
- I don't know, the door was opening.

56:52.193 --> 56:54.360
- Oh, baby, hey, hey, hey.

56:55.250 --> 56:56.749
Listen, listen, listen.

56:56.749 --> 56:57.867
Just a glitch or something.

56:57.867 --> 56:59.176
- It's not a glitch.

56:59.176 --> 57:01.831
I heard someone come in the back door.

57:01.831 --> 57:03.291
- Veronica, listen.
- And I was in the bathtub.

57:03.291 --> 57:07.252
- Honey, listen, it's OK, it's
OK, listen, it's OK, it's OK.

57:07.252 --> 57:09.381
It's OK, I'm here.

57:09.381 --> 57:10.214
I'm here.

57:11.381 --> 57:13.329
- Can't we please go home?

57:13.329 --> 57:15.349
I don't like it here, it's really creepy.

57:15.349 --> 57:18.592
- I understand, I understand,
I get it, I get it.

57:18.592 --> 57:19.425
I do.

57:19.425 --> 57:21.230
I know this house is a little weird.

57:21.230 --> 57:23.647
(chattering)

57:26.118 --> 57:26.951
OK?

57:34.698 --> 57:37.365
(ominous music)

58:06.500 --> 58:09.093
- I think I know what
the problem is with this.

58:15.670 --> 58:20.313
Alex's main control unit
has to be restarted.

58:26.980 --> 58:29.560
- So everything should be fixed now?

58:29.560 --> 58:30.393
- Yeah.

58:31.650 --> 58:32.483
Should be.

58:33.950 --> 58:36.700
- AC too?
- Fine.

58:36.700 --> 58:39.440
- And what about the lights
flickering back and forth?

58:39.440 --> 58:41.490
- Well, the system had to have an update.

58:41.490 --> 58:45.030
So, when that restarts, you
won't have to worry about that

58:45.030 --> 58:47.100
anymore.
- And the doors

58:47.100 --> 58:49.000
opening and closing by themselves?

58:49.000 --> 58:49.883
- Should be fine.

58:52.205 --> 58:53.663
Look.

58:54.680 --> 58:57.713
I feel terrible about
everything that's happened.

58:57.713 --> 59:01.383
The house, your wife
getting her money stolen.

59:02.870 --> 59:04.970
I'm gonna make sure you get a full refund.

59:06.430 --> 59:07.720
- Really?

59:07.720 --> 59:10.530
Wow, I mean, you don't have to--

59:10.530 --> 59:12.300
- No, no, no, no.

59:12.300 --> 59:13.683
It's the least we can do.

59:14.780 --> 59:18.720
No one should start their
marriage surrounded by chaos.

59:18.720 --> 59:21.573
Let's end your honeymoon in paradise.

59:23.220 --> 59:26.010
- Wow, really appreciate that Allen.

59:26.010 --> 59:28.250
- Give your better half my best.

59:28.250 --> 59:29.460
- I will.

59:29.460 --> 59:30.293
Thank you.

59:38.282 --> 59:39.803
So.

59:39.803 --> 59:42.220
What do you want to do today?

59:43.328 --> 59:45.506
- Actually, I think I'm gonna run to town

59:45.506 --> 59:48.280
and get something to cook for later.

59:48.280 --> 59:49.270
- OK, good, I'll go with you.

59:49.270 --> 59:51.860
- I think I'm just gonna go by myself.

59:51.860 --> 59:52.860
Can I get your card?

59:54.436 --> 59:55.510
- Yeah.

59:55.510 --> 59:56.930
You sure you're OK?

59:56.930 --> 59:59.148
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- You don't seem OK.

59:59.148 --> 1:00:01.013
- I'm good, thanks, babe.

1:00:01.013 --> 1:00:02.560
- Hey, hey.

1:00:02.560 --> 1:00:04.023
Look at me.

1:00:04.023 --> 1:00:05.104
What's wrong?

1:00:05.104 --> 1:00:05.937
Is it me?

1:00:06.813 --> 1:00:08.349
- That's not true.

1:00:08.349 --> 1:00:09.799
I love you.
- Love you most.

1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:13.180
Love the way you walk away.

1:00:13.180 --> 1:00:14.800
How it shakes.

1:00:14.800 --> 1:00:16.043
How it makes me smile.

1:00:44.554 --> 1:00:46.660
- Got some goodies, guys.

1:00:46.660 --> 1:00:49.200
Healthy stuff, naturally,
but also a little bit

1:00:49.200 --> 1:00:50.747
of naughty stuff.

1:00:50.747 --> 1:00:51.580
Kind of full balance.

1:00:51.580 --> 1:00:53.070
Shit.
- I'm sorry.

1:00:53.070 --> 1:00:53.903
I didn't mean to frighten you.

1:00:53.903 --> 1:00:55.801
- You scared me.
- I didn't mean

1:00:55.801 --> 1:00:57.161
to frighten you.

1:00:57.161 --> 1:00:58.367
I figured you might want your wallet back.

1:00:58.367 --> 1:00:59.343
The cash and credit cards
are gone, I'm afraid.

1:01:01.235 --> 1:01:02.270
- [Veronica] And how do
I know you're not working

1:01:02.270 --> 1:01:03.540
with those two con artists?

1:01:03.540 --> 1:01:05.190
- I'm not working with anyone.
- Why have you

1:01:05.190 --> 1:01:07.310
been following me and my husband?

1:01:07.310 --> 1:01:08.490
Are you a cop?
- No, no,

1:01:08.490 --> 1:01:10.470
Miss Kinslow, my name is Diego Forest,

1:01:10.470 --> 1:01:12.940
I'm a private investigator
out of New York City.

1:01:12.940 --> 1:01:14.970
I was hired to investigate
a missing persons case

1:01:14.970 --> 1:01:17.226
from five years ago.
- What does that

1:01:17.226 --> 1:01:18.340
have to do with me?

1:01:18.340 --> 1:01:20.060
- The two missing persons were last seen

1:01:20.060 --> 1:01:22.590
renting out the same house
in the same neighborhood

1:01:22.590 --> 1:01:24.990
you and your husband
Anthony are now staying in.

1:01:26.030 --> 1:01:27.560
I've tried getting
information from other people

1:01:27.560 --> 1:01:30.100
in this town, but no one is talking.

1:01:30.100 --> 1:01:32.170
- [Veronica] Maybe they
don't know anything.

1:01:32.170 --> 1:01:33.890
- With all due respect,
I can tell the difference

1:01:33.890 --> 1:01:35.190
between people not knowing anything

1:01:35.190 --> 1:01:36.490
and when people are lying.

1:01:37.620 --> 1:01:38.980
- [Veronica] Well, I'm
sorry, but I can't help you.

1:01:38.980 --> 1:01:40.443
- OK, look, OK, take this,
take this, take this.

1:01:40.443 --> 1:01:42.670
This is a list of names.

1:01:42.670 --> 1:01:43.670
People who have gone missing.

1:01:43.670 --> 1:01:45.800
If you don't believe me,
just do your own research.

1:01:45.800 --> 1:01:48.636
Look up something called the
Order of the Second Circle.

1:01:48.636 --> 1:01:50.340
If you want my help, just call the number

1:01:50.340 --> 1:01:52.040
on the bottom, thank you.

1:01:52.040 --> 1:01:52.917
God bless you.

1:02:03.270 --> 1:02:04.683
- What the fuck was that?

1:02:06.390 --> 1:02:07.415
My God.

1:02:07.415 --> 1:02:08.923
The Order of the Second Circle?

1:02:09.940 --> 1:02:12.050
He may well have said
the fucking Illuminati.

1:02:12.050 --> 1:02:12.883
What the?

1:02:14.040 --> 1:02:16.090
These people are stressing me out, y'all.

1:02:27.320 --> 1:02:29.453
- Video journal entry number 159.

1:02:30.600 --> 1:02:33.623
I've made direct contact
with Veronica Kinslow.

1:02:36.006 --> 1:02:38.563
I don't know if she believes me or not.

1:02:41.780 --> 1:02:44.130
Further surveillance will
provide more answers.

1:02:47.343 --> 1:02:52.343
Yeah.

1:02:54.027 --> 1:02:55.377
- You got room for dessert?

1:02:56.750 --> 1:02:58.293
- Not right now, OK?

1:03:00.370 --> 1:03:01.203
- Hey.

1:03:02.952 --> 1:03:04.087
You know I love you, right?

1:03:04.087 --> 1:03:07.420
- You better.
- No, I'm serious,

1:03:07.420 --> 1:03:10.610
I'm just saying, you know, this honeymoon

1:03:10.610 --> 1:03:12.373
being all bummy and whatnot.

1:03:13.230 --> 1:03:15.770
This vacation hasn't really turned out

1:03:15.770 --> 1:03:17.510
to be what I thought.

1:03:17.510 --> 1:03:21.180
So, just want you to
know that no matter what,

1:03:21.180 --> 1:03:23.437
I will always be here for you.

1:03:26.926 --> 1:03:27.823
- And.

1:03:29.860 --> 1:03:30.693
- Yes?

1:03:35.610 --> 1:03:38.393
- I spoke with that tattoo guy today.

1:03:41.337 --> 1:03:42.840
- You OK?

1:03:42.840 --> 1:03:43.673
Did he hurt you?

1:03:44.719 --> 1:03:46.773
- Yeah, he didn't hurt me.

1:03:48.665 --> 1:03:51.490
But he did tell me that he's a PI.

1:03:51.490 --> 1:03:53.340
Investigating people who went missing

1:03:53.340 --> 1:03:54.897
from this neighborhood.

1:03:57.020 --> 1:03:58.770
He also gave me this.

1:04:03.022 --> 1:04:04.610
- What is this, who are these people?

1:04:04.610 --> 1:04:06.553
- It's a list of the
people who went missing.

1:04:07.400 --> 1:04:09.760
And he told me if I didn't believe him,

1:04:09.760 --> 1:04:11.483
that I should look it up myself.

1:04:13.710 --> 1:04:15.130
- Is this his phone number here?

1:04:15.130 --> 1:04:15.963
- Yeah.

1:04:16.980 --> 1:04:19.010
- I'm gonna call this son of a bitch.

1:04:19.010 --> 1:04:20.563
- Anthony.
- I don't think this is--

1:04:20.563 --> 1:04:21.743
- I want to check out his story.

1:04:23.983 --> 1:04:27.383
- What if he's crazy?
- And what if he's not?

1:04:32.387 --> 1:04:33.220
- OK, OK.

1:04:34.530 --> 1:04:35.363
Check it out.

1:04:36.550 --> 1:04:39.233
And I will clean up.

1:04:40.730 --> 1:04:41.563
- Thank you.

1:04:50.430 --> 1:04:52.697
- Something you gonna
have to learn by yourself.

1:04:52.697 --> 1:04:55.203
You know, not to talk to strangers.

1:05:20.010 --> 1:05:20.860
So what you find?

1:05:22.700 --> 1:05:25.673
- These missing person cases
are from all over the world.

1:05:27.750 --> 1:05:30.140
- So you telling me that
these people could have

1:05:30.140 --> 1:05:31.673
been looked up anywhere online?

1:05:33.050 --> 1:05:34.183
- Yeah, maybe.

1:05:37.070 --> 1:05:39.963
But I also looked up this
Order of the Second Circle.

1:05:42.193 --> 1:05:44.243
I mean, I'm only able to find their,

1:05:46.830 --> 1:05:51.373
like their charity work, but I don't know.

1:05:52.420 --> 1:05:55.887
- Baby, I think tattoo
boy is messing with you.

1:05:56.910 --> 1:05:57.743
- You think so?

1:05:58.750 --> 1:05:59.583
- I know so.

1:06:01.540 --> 1:06:02.840
Listen.

1:06:02.840 --> 1:06:04.810
We're only here 'til tomorrow.

1:06:04.810 --> 1:06:09.810
So, let's try and enjoy ourselves.

1:06:09.870 --> 1:06:14.090
And then tomorrow, we can

1:06:15.805 --> 1:06:20.805
go home, hmm?

1:06:22.917 --> 1:06:27.633
- OK.

1:06:32.564 --> 1:06:35.147
(sultry music)

1:07:06.595 --> 1:07:07.428
Hey guys.

1:07:07.428 --> 1:07:09.034
It's our last night here.

1:07:09.034 --> 1:07:10.300
You know, it really hasn't been perfect,

1:07:10.300 --> 1:07:12.623
but overall it's been pretty good.

1:07:13.830 --> 1:07:15.653
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, hon.

1:07:17.155 --> 1:07:18.327
- What's going on?

1:07:18.327 --> 1:07:19.400
- What are you doing?

1:07:19.400 --> 1:07:23.500
- I ran into Allen when I was jogging.

1:07:23.500 --> 1:07:24.740
- OK.
- And he mentioned

1:07:24.740 --> 1:07:27.628
something about some undesirables.

1:07:27.628 --> 1:07:28.850
- Undesirables, what does that mean?

1:07:28.850 --> 1:07:30.610
- I don't know.

1:07:30.610 --> 1:07:33.630
He kind of just avoided
the whole conversation.

1:07:33.630 --> 1:07:34.950
- That's weird.

1:07:34.950 --> 1:07:36.980
- Yeah, well, he's kind of weird.

1:07:36.980 --> 1:07:38.207
- His name is (foreign language spoken).

1:07:39.130 --> 1:07:41.070
Bothering us this whole time.

1:07:41.070 --> 1:07:43.153
- She loves you, I love you.

1:07:44.553 --> 1:07:46.144
- I love you.
- I love you.

1:07:46.144 --> 1:07:48.085
- Your beard's in my eye.

1:07:48.085 --> 1:07:50.585
(tense music)

1:08:10.336 --> 1:08:13.003
Oh my God, it is nice and quiet.

1:08:14.671 --> 1:08:16.421
- Too nice and quiet.

1:08:18.460 --> 1:08:21.387
Alex, play us some jazz.

1:08:24.977 --> 1:08:27.394
(jazz music)

1:08:31.239 --> 1:08:33.656
(chattering)

1:08:47.915 --> 1:08:50.627
Babe, why did people
bring us stuff like this?

1:08:52.669 --> 1:08:55.145
This is not a bag, this is canned goods.

1:08:55.145 --> 1:08:56.160
This is what this is.

1:08:56.160 --> 1:08:58.323
- You are so dramatic.
- This is what you give

1:08:58.323 --> 1:08:59.860
people in need.

1:08:59.860 --> 1:09:02.513
No, she's trying to say we in need.

1:09:02.513 --> 1:09:03.930
This is Kool-Aid.

1:09:05.097 --> 1:09:07.220
I know M2020 when I see it.

1:09:07.220 --> 1:09:08.978
- You love Kool-Aid.

1:09:08.978 --> 1:09:09.811
M2020.

1:09:11.186 --> 1:09:13.878
- And what is again, I
just don't even understand.

1:09:13.878 --> 1:09:16.057
- What are you doing?

1:09:16.057 --> 1:09:17.233
- Sorry, sorry.

1:09:17.233 --> 1:09:21.566
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
- Drop it on the ground.

1:09:33.624 --> 1:09:34.624
- This?

1:09:34.624 --> 1:09:36.607
It's a spy cam.

1:09:38.381 --> 1:09:40.797
- Is that one of yours?

1:09:40.797 --> 1:09:41.630
- No.

1:09:48.384 --> 1:09:51.384
No it's not.
- Babe, where you going?

1:10:12.541 --> 1:10:13.590
Babe, what are you doing?

1:10:13.590 --> 1:10:16.440
- I am recording everything
in this damn house

1:10:16.440 --> 1:10:18.590
until we get the hell
out of here tomorrow.

1:10:20.201 --> 1:10:22.182
(ominous music)

1:10:22.182 --> 1:10:23.390
Come here, baby.

1:10:23.390 --> 1:10:24.730
Hey, what was the name
of that, the group that

1:10:24.730 --> 1:10:26.500
the tattoo guy told you about yesterday?

1:10:26.500 --> 1:10:28.637
- Why?
- Babe, just what was

1:10:28.637 --> 1:10:29.517
the name of the group?

1:10:29.517 --> 1:10:31.563
- The Order of the Second Circle.

1:10:33.484 --> 1:10:35.984
(tense music)

1:10:46.861 --> 1:10:48.260
I didn't see any of this last night.

1:10:48.260 --> 1:10:51.630
- That's because this is the dark web

1:10:51.630 --> 1:10:53.253
and you can find all kinds of.

1:11:01.520 --> 1:11:03.570
Just, just keep packing our shit, please.

1:11:03.570 --> 1:11:04.520
Just give me a few.

1:11:07.424 --> 1:11:10.091
(ominous music)

1:11:31.615 --> 1:11:36.615
Oh my God, Veronica,
Veronica, look at this.

1:11:36.911 --> 1:11:39.411
- What is that?
- I don't know.

1:11:47.827 --> 1:11:52.827
Oh shit.

1:11:55.141 --> 1:11:56.391
- What is this?

1:12:01.975 --> 1:12:04.308
(screaming)

1:12:08.615 --> 1:12:09.698
What is that?

1:12:12.492 --> 1:12:13.325
- It's us.

1:12:17.245 --> 1:12:18.078
Right now.

1:12:20.848 --> 1:12:23.598
(alarm sounding)

1:12:29.279 --> 1:12:31.846
- Get the door, get the door.

1:12:31.846 --> 1:12:34.839
Fuck, oh my God, come on, come on.

1:12:34.839 --> 1:12:37.589
(dramatic music)

1:12:42.816 --> 1:12:47.816
- Run, run.

1:12:50.498 --> 1:12:53.665
(yelling and panting)

1:12:58.198 --> 1:12:59.626
- What are we gonna do?

1:12:59.626 --> 1:13:01.959
(screaming)

1:13:11.467 --> 1:13:12.467
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:13:12.467 --> 1:13:13.512
I don't have time to explain, OK?

1:13:13.512 --> 1:13:14.571
We have to get out of this house.

1:13:14.571 --> 1:13:16.988
- Tell us the shit right now.

1:13:22.704 --> 1:13:24.452
- They found a way out.

1:13:24.452 --> 1:13:25.436
- What the fuck?

1:13:25.436 --> 1:13:26.776
(gun shooting)

1:13:26.776 --> 1:13:29.016
(screaming)

1:13:29.016 --> 1:13:31.433
(chattering)

1:13:34.489 --> 1:13:36.908
- It's OK, it's OK, you
see me, do you see me?

1:13:36.908 --> 1:13:38.908
OK, when I shoot one of them, just grab

1:13:38.908 --> 1:13:40.830
whatever weapons they have, OK?

1:13:40.830 --> 1:13:42.998
Now stay behind me and watch my back.

1:13:42.998 --> 1:13:45.238
- [Anthony] Come on baby, come on baby.

1:13:45.238 --> 1:13:47.988
(dramatic music)

1:13:49.514 --> 1:13:52.097
(gun shooting)

1:14:02.476 --> 1:14:04.559
(crying)

1:14:12.074 --> 1:14:14.491
(chattering)

1:14:31.005 --> 1:14:33.255
(grunting)

1:14:45.228 --> 1:14:47.561
- You OK?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:14:54.112 --> 1:14:59.112
- [Anthony] Holy shit, oh
shit, oh shit, what the fuck?

1:14:59.368 --> 1:15:00.535
What the fuck?

1:15:10.373 --> 1:15:11.290
- Let's go.

1:15:18.410 --> 1:15:19.743
- What do we do?

1:15:30.079 --> 1:15:33.406
- [Anthony] What the fuck do you want?

1:15:33.406 --> 1:15:34.239
Oh shit.

1:15:36.290 --> 1:15:38.078
Fucking fuck.

1:15:38.078 --> 1:15:40.328
(grunting)

1:15:41.358 --> 1:15:43.691
(screaming)

1:15:47.496 --> 1:15:48.329
Oh shit.

1:15:49.544 --> 1:15:50.377
Oh.

1:15:55.173 --> 1:15:57.256
(crying)

1:16:14.818 --> 1:16:17.235
(whispering)

1:16:25.151 --> 1:16:25.984
- Help me.

1:16:27.935 --> 1:16:28.768
Help me.

1:16:32.255 --> 1:16:33.672
Help me, help me.

1:16:34.541 --> 1:16:37.208
(ominous music)
