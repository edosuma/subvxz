WEBVTT

00:00.744 --> 00:02.445
We need to go over the schedule
leading up to the primary.

00:02.482 --> 00:04.081
- Let's talk shop.
- Ooh, shop talk!

00:04.110 --> 00:05.825
One of my five favorite
types of talk,

00:05.945 --> 00:08.079
along with pillow, girl,
real, and TED.

00:08.114 --> 00:09.681
Why are you wearing a poncho?

00:09.715 --> 00:13.018
Oh, because every surface area
in your house is sticky.

00:13.052 --> 00:15.687
Last time I was here, I found
a melted crayon on my blazer.

00:15.721 --> 00:16.822
Okay.

00:16.856 --> 00:19.357
I have a photo op
with Gryzzl tomorrow.

00:19.392 --> 00:21.493
Between now and then, we
have a ton of stuff scheduled.

00:21.527 --> 00:24.262
Looks like we're gonna have
to skip the pie-baking event

00:24.297 --> 00:25.864
and the ceremonial squash toss.

00:25.898 --> 00:26.832
- Oh.
- Oh, really?

00:26.866 --> 00:28.100
We have to skip that?

00:28.134 --> 00:30.335
I love watching those squashes
fly through the air.

00:30.369 --> 00:31.603
I kind of like
the way they land.

00:31.637 --> 00:32.604
Me too!

00:32.637 --> 00:33.605
[both laughing]

00:33.639 --> 00:34.840
Okay, excuse me,

00:34.874 --> 00:38.210
but I have to get back to a city
where things happen.

00:38.244 --> 00:39.344
Okay.

00:39.378 --> 00:41.079
This campaign is about to start
in earnest.

00:41.114 --> 00:43.215
Things are about to get
real intense.

00:43.249 --> 00:44.416
Leslie, you ready?

00:44.450 --> 00:45.484
- Me Leslie?
- Yeah.

00:45.518 --> 00:47.285
Well, I was an actual candidate,

00:47.320 --> 00:49.421
so I think I can handle
being a candidate's wife.

00:49.455 --> 00:50.989
I know all the issues
inside and out.

00:51.023 --> 00:52.490
Mm.
See, that's the problem.

00:52.525 --> 00:54.960
Being the wife of
is a minefield.

00:54.994 --> 00:56.128
If you were just
a ding-dong,

00:56.162 --> 00:57.696
I would just
slap a flag pin on you.

00:57.730 --> 00:59.231
I'd pour some Valium
down your throat

00:59.265 --> 01:02.200
and just shove you behind
the podium way upstage.

01:02.235 --> 01:04.903
It's the smarties
that freak people out.

01:04.937 --> 01:06.605
I think you're underestimating
the voters.

01:06.639 --> 01:08.540
[laughing]

01:08.574 --> 01:12.177
I don't think that is possible.

01:12.211 --> 01:13.445
(Leslie) Stephen, be careful!

01:13.479 --> 01:15.514
[gasps]

01:15.548 --> 01:18.049
Poncho!

01:18.084 --> 01:21.019
[triumphant music]

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:38.151 --> 01:40.639
I know you normally
hate foundations,

01:40.673 --> 01:43.008
but this one
I think you'll actually like.

01:43.042 --> 01:45.377
We take people that don't know
what they want to do

01:45.411 --> 01:48.213
and then put them to work doing
cool stuff all over the world,

01:48.247 --> 01:49.555
and I start in a couple months.

01:49.675 --> 01:52.851
Well, I had hoped you'd choose
a more dignified trade

01:52.885 --> 01:55.153
like masonry or logging,

01:55.187 --> 01:57.155
but you are
out of local government,

01:57.190 --> 01:59.124
and that's a step
in the right direction.

01:59.158 --> 02:01.560
It's definitely
the job I wanted...

02:03.262 --> 02:07.599
But it means that we
have to move to Washington.

02:07.633 --> 02:11.203
Well...
then bully for you.

02:11.237 --> 02:12.971
If you intend to move,

02:13.005 --> 02:16.074
I suppose you should return
the spare key to my house,

02:16.109 --> 02:19.211
the one I gave you years ago
when you were my assistant,

02:19.245 --> 02:21.113
for emergencies.

02:21.147 --> 02:22.180
Okay.

02:22.215 --> 02:24.516
Good talk.

02:27.487 --> 02:28.720
(Ben) This neighborhood

02:28.755 --> 02:30.772
has been mostly abandoned
for years,

02:30.891 --> 02:33.226
but now, thanks
to the new Gryzzl headquarters,

02:33.260 --> 02:35.495
this district will soon
transform

02:35.529 --> 02:38.598
into a hub of innovation
for decades to come.

02:38.632 --> 02:39.599
Mr. Wyatt!

02:39.633 --> 02:41.334
Your campaign released
a schedule,

02:41.368 --> 02:43.803
and it looks like your wife
is skipping the Pie-mary.

02:43.837 --> 02:45.138
Care to explain?

02:45.172 --> 02:47.740
The Pie-mary
is a Southern Indiana tradition

02:47.775 --> 02:49.308
where Congressional
candidates' wives

02:49.343 --> 02:51.778
face off
in a pie-baking contest.

02:51.812 --> 02:53.313
The last contest winner

02:53.347 --> 02:55.348
was June Hartwell's
buttermilk meringue.

02:55.382 --> 02:58.785
Last contest loser
was all women.

02:58.819 --> 03:00.887
Leslie would be the first
candidate's wife

03:00.921 --> 03:02.522
not to enter the Pie-mary.

03:02.556 --> 03:05.158
What kind of a statement
are you making by skipping it?

03:05.192 --> 03:07.060
We're--I'm not making
any kind of statement.

03:07.094 --> 03:09.095
We're just focusing
on bigger issues,

03:09.129 --> 03:13.733
like Ben's $150 million
revitalization project.

03:13.767 --> 03:14.934
Pardon me.
I need to get through.

03:14.968 --> 03:15.935
Pardon me. Excuse me.

03:15.969 --> 03:17.003
Mike Patterson here.

03:17.037 --> 03:18.237
Leslie, you've
made it pretty clear

03:18.272 --> 03:20.032
that you don't think homemaking
is important.

03:20.040 --> 03:21.708
Do you ever cook
for your children,

03:21.742 --> 03:24.210
and who's even watching
your children right now,

03:24.244 --> 03:25.778
while you're out
God only knows where?

03:25.813 --> 03:26.894
What are you talking about?

03:26.914 --> 03:28.381
I'm standing right here
in front of you.

03:28.415 --> 03:30.216
Okay. Take it easy.
Let's not get emotional.

03:30.250 --> 03:31.618
Okay.
We have to run.

03:31.652 --> 03:33.386
We'll see you all
at my economic address.

03:33.420 --> 03:34.587
Thanks for coming, everybody.

03:34.621 --> 03:36.456
What other traditions
are you against, Leslie?

03:36.490 --> 03:38.191
Baseball?
Hugging your children?

03:38.225 --> 03:39.892
How much did that haircut cost?

03:39.927 --> 03:42.061
None of your business,
and thank you for noticing.

03:42.996 --> 03:44.330
My desk was right here,

03:44.365 --> 03:45.999
sitting right on top of it
this whole time.

03:46.033 --> 03:47.033
How much money is it?

03:47.067 --> 03:48.067
It's not money.

03:48.102 --> 03:49.469
I told you, it's Ron's key.

03:49.503 --> 03:50.903
I hid it in here years ago.

03:50.938 --> 03:52.238
Ah! Wait!

03:52.272 --> 03:53.539
Yeah, no. No key.

03:53.574 --> 03:56.576
Just a note and a movie ticket
stub and four teeth.

03:56.610 --> 03:57.931
"If you are looking
for Ron's key,

03:57.945 --> 03:59.712
"I moved it,
and you'll never find it.

03:59.747 --> 04:01.047
Cordially, April."

04:01.081 --> 04:02.348
Well, where'd you put it, then?

04:02.383 --> 04:03.883
I don't know.
It was eight years ago.

04:03.917 --> 04:05.318
Oh, God.

04:05.352 --> 04:07.920
A key to Ron's house is lost
in a government building.

04:07.955 --> 04:09.036
That's his worst nightmare.

04:09.056 --> 04:09.989
Listen, babe.

04:10.024 --> 04:11.491
All we got to do

04:11.525 --> 04:14.394
is train Champion
to sniff out Ron's key.

04:14.428 --> 04:15.762
Okay.

04:15.796 --> 04:17.863
All we need is Ron's key
to give him a scent.

04:17.898 --> 04:19.932
So give me the key,
and I'll get you that key.

04:19.966 --> 04:21.701
[moaning]

04:21.735 --> 04:25.305
<i>No, You're Wrong</i>
with Mike Patterson.

04:25.339 --> 04:26.406
Welcome back to the program.

04:26.440 --> 04:28.107
My guest is June Hartwell,

04:28.142 --> 04:30.543
wife of incumbent Congressman,
Paul Hartwell.

04:30.577 --> 04:31.744
Now, June, we all know

04:31.779 --> 04:33.299
what Ben Wyatt's wife
is really saying.

04:33.314 --> 04:34.714
By skipping the Pie-mary,

04:34.748 --> 04:38.017
she's saying women who love
their families are stupid.

04:38.052 --> 04:40.453
Well, Mike, we all
make certain choices.

04:40.487 --> 04:42.722
Ms. Knope chose
to try to have it all.

04:42.756 --> 04:44.691
I chose to put my family first.

04:44.725 --> 04:46.005
Well, I'm just speculating here,

04:46.026 --> 04:47.694
but do you think
that Leslie Knope's actions

04:47.728 --> 04:50.063
indicate that she actually hates
her family?

04:50.097 --> 04:54.100
Well, it only took three hours
for Jen to be right.

04:54.134 --> 04:55.668
I'm officially a distraction.

04:55.703 --> 04:56.869
I'm gonna enter
that Pie-mary.

04:56.904 --> 04:58.771
This is just nonsense.
It'll blow over.

04:58.806 --> 05:01.474
And the Pie-mary
is ridiculous and antiquated.

05:01.508 --> 05:02.875
But the more
they talk about this,

05:02.910 --> 05:05.078
the less they're gonna talk
about your economic plan.

05:05.112 --> 05:06.713
Besides,
I'm good at making pies,

05:06.747 --> 05:09.449
so I'll win,
and then I can promote

05:09.483 --> 05:12.352
my self-published women's rights
barbecue cookbook--

05:12.386 --> 05:13.886
<i>The Feminine Mesquite.</i>

05:13.921 --> 05:15.388
Everything's fine.

05:15.422 --> 05:17.023
(April)
I had it in a safe place,

05:17.057 --> 05:19.158
and then I moved it
to protect it,

05:19.193 --> 05:20.980
and I don't remember where.

05:21.037 --> 05:22.004
I see.

05:22.038 --> 05:23.472
(Andy) Don't be mad, Ron.

05:23.506 --> 05:25.741
She hid it too good,

05:25.775 --> 05:27.776
and she left a string of clues.

05:27.810 --> 05:32.080
It's an impossible puzzle,
and I love puzzles!

05:32.115 --> 05:35.217
A minimal, unhelpful note,
these appear to be human teeth,

05:35.251 --> 05:36.218
and what is this?

05:36.252 --> 05:37.519
<i>Twilight: New Moon.</i>

05:37.553 --> 05:40.022
It's a movie,
but I've never seen it.

05:40.056 --> 05:41.790
It's, like,
about lame werewolves

05:41.824 --> 05:43.058
and vampires and stuff.

05:43.092 --> 05:45.360
Donna likes those things!

05:45.395 --> 05:47.129
(Ron) Dollars to doughnuts
this points us her way.

05:47.163 --> 05:50.332
Finally, a scavenger hunt
worthy of my time.

05:50.366 --> 05:51.400
Onward!

05:52.402 --> 05:53.535
(Leslie) Okay.

05:53.569 --> 05:55.671
Snacks given, kids tucked in,
books read,

05:55.705 --> 05:57.939
three simultaneous meltdowns
for no reason,

05:57.974 --> 05:59.541
kids tucked back in,

05:59.575 --> 06:01.944
one of them briefly
got outside somehow,

06:01.978 --> 06:02.911
kids back in bed.

06:02.945 --> 06:04.179
They're all napping.

06:04.213 --> 06:07.149
Okay, I got everything
you need for pie domination.

06:07.183 --> 06:09.251
I even got
an extra whipped-cream can.

06:09.285 --> 06:12.587
One for baking,
one for directly-into-mouth.

06:12.622 --> 06:14.223
Oh, you know me so well.

06:14.257 --> 06:16.058
[doorbell rings]

06:16.092 --> 06:18.160
That might be one of the kids.

06:18.194 --> 06:19.194
Hi, Leslie.

06:19.228 --> 06:20.362
Elise Yarktin

06:20.396 --> 06:22.197
from the Indiana
Organization of Women.

06:22.231 --> 06:24.600
Oh, my goodness!
Elise, please come in.

06:24.634 --> 06:25.867
[gasps]
Wait!

06:25.902 --> 06:28.170
Are you here to give me
the Woman of the Year award?

06:28.204 --> 06:29.471
I have a speech prepared.

06:29.505 --> 06:31.106
Would you like
to see it right now?

06:31.140 --> 06:32.107
No.

06:32.141 --> 06:33.542
Leslie, we were thrilled

06:33.576 --> 06:35.711
to find out you were boycotting
that ridiculous Pie-mary,

06:35.745 --> 06:37.579
but we just got word
you've decided to enter?

06:37.614 --> 06:39.047
Yeah.

06:39.082 --> 06:41.883
Well, I agree that it's dumb,
but this is not about me.

06:41.918 --> 06:45.354
It's about Ben, and he will do
more for women than Hartwell.

06:45.388 --> 06:47.222
So, you know, lose a battle,
win the war.

06:47.257 --> 06:48.690
That kind of thing.
It's the way to go.

06:48.725 --> 06:50.392
Look, the Pie-mary
is retrogressive

06:50.426 --> 06:52.594
and misogynistic,
and if you participate,

06:52.628 --> 06:53.695
we will have no choice

06:53.730 --> 06:55.931
but to protest you and Ben
at the event.

06:55.965 --> 06:58.100
Hope you like pies...

06:58.134 --> 07:00.068
in yo' face.

07:00.103 --> 07:01.803
Metaphorically.
We'll be civil.

07:01.838 --> 07:05.107
Elise, there is no bigger
defender of gender equality

07:05.141 --> 07:07.109
than Leslie Knope,
and my husband, Ben,

07:07.143 --> 07:10.245
is a progressive champion
of women's rights.

07:10.280 --> 07:11.813
(Ben) Babe, the oven's ready.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.515
Chop-chop!
Time to get baking.

07:13.549 --> 07:16.184
Daddy want pie!

07:16.219 --> 07:17.962
Hi. Ben Wyatt.

07:20.927 --> 07:22.936
We have a wonderfully
small number of clues.

07:23.056 --> 07:24.389
One is this ticket.

07:24.424 --> 07:27.292
Did you see this movie
about vampires and such?

07:27.327 --> 07:28.226
<i>New Moon?</i>

07:28.261 --> 07:29.895
Yeah, I saw it with April.

07:29.929 --> 07:31.730
She was so hopped up
on painkillers

07:31.764 --> 07:33.131
from getting
her wisdom teeth out,

07:33.166 --> 07:34.700
I convinced her
to see it with me.

07:34.734 --> 07:36.602
The teeth!
They're yours.

07:36.636 --> 07:38.237
You were super out of it.

07:38.271 --> 07:40.672
You kept yelling,
"Team Voldemort!" at the screen,

07:40.707 --> 07:41.840
and we were kicked out.

07:41.874 --> 07:43.508
I was furious.

07:43.543 --> 07:45.377
You only get to see
the second <i> Twilight </i> film

07:45.411 --> 07:46.745
for the seventh time once.

07:46.779 --> 07:48.914
Do you remember anything
about a key

07:48.948 --> 07:51.717
or April doing
anything unusual that day?

07:51.751 --> 07:54.219
She did make us stop
by the shoe-shine stand

07:54.254 --> 07:55.654
before she left,
because she wanted

07:55.688 --> 07:57.322
to drop something off for Andy.

07:57.357 --> 07:59.091
She had a real bad crush on him.

07:59.125 --> 08:02.928
[laughing]
Oh, babe! You had a crush on me!

08:02.962 --> 08:04.196
That's embarrassing.

08:04.230 --> 08:05.163
We're married.

08:05.198 --> 08:06.465
Still!

08:06.499 --> 08:08.066
To the shoe-shine stand!

08:08.101 --> 08:10.636
- Stop! Stop!
- Ooh, chase me!

08:14.474 --> 08:16.041
Garry, what the hell
are you doing?

08:16.075 --> 08:17.209
Oh, gosh.

08:17.243 --> 08:19.478
Well, I dropped my wedding ring
down this grate,

08:19.512 --> 08:20.913
and then I was trying
to get it out,

08:20.947 --> 08:22.648
and I dropped my keys
down there too,

08:22.682 --> 08:24.683
so I can't leave.

08:24.717 --> 08:26.418
Damn. This takes me back.

08:26.452 --> 08:27.886
You mind if I stay and watch?

08:27.921 --> 08:28.887
Oh, not at all.

08:28.921 --> 08:30.322
Appreciate the company.

08:30.356 --> 08:32.289
(Leslie) The I.O.W.
does not mess around,

08:32.325 --> 08:33.625
which, normally,
is why I love them,

08:33.659 --> 08:34.993
but now I'm on the other side.

08:35.028 --> 08:36.160
Oh, my God, Ben!

08:36.195 --> 08:38.196
I gave them $100
in their annual pledge.

08:38.231 --> 08:40.799
Do you know how many anti-me
signs that could buy?

08:40.832 --> 08:43.635
You just don't do
the pie contest, obviously.

08:43.669 --> 08:45.203
Then we're just back
where we started.

08:45.238 --> 08:46.559
Then it just seems
like I'm saying

08:46.572 --> 08:48.040
I'm better
than the women who bake.

08:48.074 --> 08:50.042
What should we do?
Should we get a divorce?

08:50.076 --> 08:51.810
Well, how about this?

08:51.844 --> 08:53.779
What if I register
for the contest?

08:53.813 --> 08:55.047
I bake the pie.

08:55.081 --> 08:56.682
I act as my own wife.

08:56.716 --> 08:57.916
Oh, that could work.

08:57.951 --> 08:59.951
We sidestep the controversy,

08:59.986 --> 09:02.988
we refocus the campaign
onto the actual candidate,

09:03.022 --> 09:05.824
and then we flip the antiquated
tradition right on its head.

09:05.858 --> 09:08.393
Exactly, but more importantly,

09:08.428 --> 09:12.631
we change the idea
of what a pie is.

09:12.665 --> 09:14.366
I feel like
that's not more important,

09:14.400 --> 09:16.768
but I-I like the energy
that we have, so let's hear it.

09:16.803 --> 09:17.936
Okay. Picture this.

09:17.971 --> 09:21.606
Crust on the bottom,
filling, crust on top.

09:21.641 --> 09:22.741
What am I describing?

09:22.775 --> 09:23.909
A pie.

09:23.943 --> 09:26.345
No, but you're
in the right zone.

09:26.379 --> 09:27.346
Oh.

09:27.380 --> 09:29.047
- Calzone!
- Sure.

09:29.082 --> 09:31.683
Pies are just
sweet calzones, honey,

09:31.718 --> 09:33.685
and I'm good at making calzones.

09:33.720 --> 09:34.720
You're amazing.

09:34.754 --> 09:35.988
I can win this thing.

09:36.022 --> 09:37.489
Of course you can, baby!

09:37.523 --> 09:38.924
Get in there and start baking!

09:38.958 --> 09:41.126
♪ Talk about the highway ♪

09:41.160 --> 09:44.529
♪ To the calzone-zone! ♪

09:45.598 --> 09:48.000
I am having
some serious déjà vu.

09:48.034 --> 09:49.635
How many times have you lost
your wedding ring?

09:49.669 --> 09:51.536
Oh, G--
[item clatters]

09:51.571 --> 09:53.772
Too many times to count.

09:53.806 --> 09:55.507
And it causes
real trouble with Gayle.

09:55.541 --> 09:56.981
Yeah, I mean,
anytime I lose my ring,

09:57.010 --> 09:59.044
she turns
into a real grumpy goose.

09:59.078 --> 10:00.579
- Is that so?
- Oh, yeah.

10:00.613 --> 10:02.514
She'll say, you know,
"Garry, you'd lose your head

10:02.548 --> 10:03.982
if it wasn't screwed
on tight."

10:04.017 --> 10:05.717
[chuckles]
And then she makes me go

10:05.752 --> 10:07.853
for the fresh oranges
for the morning OJ.

10:07.887 --> 10:11.823
Yeah, I mean,
she says, "Hey, Mr. Forgetful."

10:11.858 --> 10:13.258
Well, I mean,
those words--

10:13.293 --> 10:14.688
I mean, they rattle
around here for hours.

10:14.808 --> 10:16.414
That's why
I've got to be extra careful

10:16.534 --> 10:18.570
with this replacement ring,
because if I lost--

10:18.690 --> 10:20.895
[ring clinking]

10:21.334 --> 10:23.829
[laughing]

10:24.153 --> 10:26.448
I'm gonna order us some dinner.

10:27.774 --> 10:29.302
[gasps]

10:29.372 --> 10:31.106
The shoe-shine stand
is gone...

10:31.141 --> 10:33.742
or maybe it was never here.

10:33.777 --> 10:35.657
(Ron) They must have moved
it during the remodel.

10:35.679 --> 10:37.746
It's probably
in basement storage.

10:37.781 --> 10:38.781
To the basement!

10:42.552 --> 10:44.720
- Tighter!
- Are you sure, dude?

10:44.754 --> 10:46.522
Yeah, dude. Tighter.
I can do it.

10:46.556 --> 10:47.656
Do what exactly?

10:47.691 --> 10:49.358
Nothing.
We're not doing anything.

10:49.392 --> 10:51.627
And we definitely
do not live down here now.

10:51.661 --> 10:53.963
Guys, where's the old
shoe-shine stand from upstairs?

10:53.997 --> 10:55.397
We don't know anything
about that.

10:55.432 --> 10:56.432
(Ron) Boys, think.

10:56.466 --> 10:57.600
We are on a quest,

10:57.634 --> 10:59.835
and we are not leaving
until we get an answer.

10:59.870 --> 11:01.737
Well, we're on our own quest,

11:01.771 --> 11:03.939
which is to squeeze this
just tight enough

11:03.974 --> 11:05.674
to make my eyes bulge out
a little bit,

11:05.709 --> 11:07.309
but not so tight that I die.

11:07.344 --> 11:08.425
(Andy) Oh, I've been there.

11:08.445 --> 11:09.912
That's a real tightrope walk.

11:09.946 --> 11:11.947
Oh! Hey!

11:11.982 --> 11:15.518
Last week this real scary ghost
came down here looking for it.

11:15.552 --> 11:18.521
It had black hair, but you could
see through its skin,

11:18.555 --> 11:19.989
and it didn't like me,

11:20.023 --> 11:22.391
but that's just 'cause
I got a soul of a Ghostbuster.

11:22.425 --> 11:23.692
Yeah, it said something

11:23.727 --> 11:26.462
about how it was worried
Brett was gonna mug it.

11:26.496 --> 11:29.432
Okay, so we're looking
for a racist ghost

11:29.466 --> 11:31.667
with black hair
who likes shoe shines.

11:31.701 --> 11:33.068
I think I have the answer.

11:33.103 --> 11:35.337
The chase continues!

11:35.372 --> 11:36.338
[both laughing]

11:36.373 --> 11:37.640
Okay, wait.

11:37.674 --> 11:39.575
The time that you told us you
were mugged in the park,

11:39.609 --> 11:41.110
what were you
reaching for in the river?

11:41.144 --> 11:43.078
- A burrito.
- That's right!

11:43.113 --> 11:46.048
You fell in the river
reaching for a burrito.

11:46.083 --> 11:48.250
Yes, ma'am, that was not
one of my finer moments.

11:48.285 --> 11:49.485
[laughs]

11:49.519 --> 11:51.187
Ooh, it's getting late.
We need to bounce.

11:51.221 --> 11:53.456
- I can give you a ride.
- Oh, thank you, Donna.

11:53.490 --> 11:55.357
Probably gonna get an earful
when I get home tonight.

11:55.392 --> 11:56.358
[sighs]

11:56.393 --> 11:58.727
Gayle might even call me
the B word.

11:58.762 --> 11:59.829
"Bozo."

11:59.863 --> 12:01.430
- Wow.
- Mm.

12:01.465 --> 12:03.866
We are very different people.

12:04.935 --> 12:06.535
Did you hear back from Elise?

12:06.570 --> 12:07.937
Oh, yeah, we're good.

12:07.971 --> 12:09.538
The I.O.W.
is not gonna protest us.

12:09.573 --> 12:11.440
How's your pie?

12:11.475 --> 12:13.542
I don't know.
I didn't make a pie.

12:13.577 --> 12:14.543
[laughs] Okay.

12:14.578 --> 12:16.111
How is your dessert calzone?

12:16.146 --> 12:17.246
It's ready.

12:17.280 --> 12:19.882
The question is, are they?

12:19.916 --> 12:21.317
All right.

12:21.351 --> 12:24.687
Our next contestant is candidate
Ben Wyatt's wife, Leslie.

12:24.721 --> 12:27.523
Let's see what Mrs. Wyatt
has baked up for us, shall we?

12:27.557 --> 12:29.425
It's actually Ms. Knope,

12:29.459 --> 12:31.694
and, actually, right now
it's Mr. Wyatt.

12:31.728 --> 12:33.295
Leslie has her own busy life,

12:33.330 --> 12:35.464
and I happen to be
an excellent pie maker,

12:35.499 --> 12:37.566
so we figured
we'd switch it up a bit.

12:37.601 --> 12:39.502
Now, pack your suitcases,

12:39.536 --> 12:42.671
because we're going
to a little town

12:42.706 --> 12:46.342
called a-Napoli
in Ital-y.

12:46.376 --> 12:49.178
(all)
Free Ben Wyatt! Free Ben Wyatt!

12:49.212 --> 12:51.714
Excuse me.
Free me from what?

12:51.748 --> 12:53.616
From the tyranny of women.

12:53.650 --> 12:54.984
We are the Male Men.

12:55.018 --> 12:56.719
We are a men's rights
activist group,

12:56.753 --> 12:58.187
and we are fed up!

12:58.221 --> 12:59.922
I'm sorry.
What's happening now?

12:59.956 --> 13:05.394
Behind every successful woman
is a man she has oppressed.

13:05.428 --> 13:08.364
First, Leslie Knope
poaches her husband's campaign

13:08.398 --> 13:10.032
by making it all about her.

13:10.066 --> 13:12.134
Now she's forcing him
to bake pies

13:12.169 --> 13:13.969
and enter a contest for her?

13:14.004 --> 13:15.037
Oh, excuse me!

13:15.072 --> 13:16.372
I'm not forcing him
to do anything.

13:16.406 --> 13:17.606
He loves to cook.

13:17.641 --> 13:20.376
He--he has five
personalized aprons.

13:20.410 --> 13:22.545
Oh, so I guess
he was asking for it

13:22.579 --> 13:24.046
because of the way
he was dressed.

13:24.081 --> 13:29.152
We are sick and tired
of this feminized society!

13:29.272 --> 13:31.840
Men have had
a very rough go of it

13:31.875 --> 13:36.078
for--just recently,
and it ends now!

13:36.112 --> 13:37.813
Male and proud!

13:37.847 --> 13:41.510
(all)
Male and proud! Male and proud!

13:42.977 --> 13:44.820
Leslie Knope exemplifies

13:44.940 --> 13:47.242
the feminist attack
on our values.

13:47.276 --> 13:48.610
She could learn
a little something

13:48.644 --> 13:50.445
about traditional
family structure

13:50.479 --> 13:52.347
from me and my husband,
Marshall.

13:52.381 --> 13:54.482
Um, fierce alert!
Eat 'em up, honey!

13:54.517 --> 13:55.884
The idea that feminism

13:55.918 --> 13:58.453
is an attack on family values
is absurd.

13:58.487 --> 14:00.822
(Joan) Ooh, so you're
defending Leslie Knope.

14:00.856 --> 14:02.290
No. Absolutely not.

14:02.324 --> 14:03.892
Frankly, I don't
think she's done enough

14:03.926 --> 14:06.728
to distance herself
from this misogynistic lunacy.

14:06.762 --> 14:09.364
(Joan) Let's turn,
now, to Sasha Dunkirk.

14:09.398 --> 14:12.767
She is head of the group
Women Against Feminism.

14:12.802 --> 14:14.636
What a surprise!

14:14.670 --> 14:18.239
The woman is only talking
to other women.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.875
Can we have one conversation
about feminism

14:20.910 --> 14:22.677
where men get to be in charge?

14:22.712 --> 14:24.345
I actually agree with him.

14:24.380 --> 14:26.314
I don't need your pity.

14:26.348 --> 14:29.484
Joan, Leslie Knope and I
are united

14:29.518 --> 14:31.519
in our disgust
of this week's events.

14:31.554 --> 14:35.323
Leslie, if you're watching,
I, Brandi Maxxxx,

14:35.358 --> 14:39.394
star of <i> 69 Jump Street</i>
and <i> 50 Shaved Old Gays,</i>

14:39.428 --> 14:40.795
have your back.

14:40.830 --> 14:41.863
Oof!

14:41.897 --> 14:43.765
Really stepped in it
this time, Knope.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.433
Why isn't
the other candidate's wife

14:45.468 --> 14:46.935
being scrutinized like this?

14:46.969 --> 14:50.538
Because June Hartwell
is a lukewarm bowl of nothing.

14:50.573 --> 14:51.973
She started
an awareness campaign

14:52.007 --> 14:53.241
called "Bring a Sweater."

14:53.275 --> 14:54.809
She calls it
goose-bump prevention.

14:54.844 --> 14:56.277
Come on, you guys,
you know the drill.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.046
Just ignore the fact
that you're right,

14:58.080 --> 15:01.616
put on your blandest outfits,
so that one, hopefully,

15:01.650 --> 15:03.610
and then just go out there
and publicly apologize.

15:03.619 --> 15:04.586
Done.

15:04.620 --> 15:06.554
- What?
- Apologize for what?

15:06.589 --> 15:08.467
Doesn't matter.
Just say you're sorry.

15:08.587 --> 15:09.802
It's like taking
a shot of tequila.

15:09.856 --> 15:11.424
You just got to force it down.

15:11.458 --> 15:13.693
Suddenly, the world feels
so much more pleasant.

15:13.727 --> 15:16.228
I do three shots every time
I have to enter this house.

15:17.330 --> 15:19.799
[sighs]
[doorbell rings]

15:19.833 --> 15:21.867
Donna, what are you
doing here so early?

15:21.902 --> 15:23.069
I come bearing gifts.

15:23.103 --> 15:25.004
First off,
I got a dude in maintenance

15:25.038 --> 15:26.439
to open up that grate
this morning.

15:26.473 --> 15:30.876
So here's your rings,
keys, credit cards,

15:30.911 --> 15:32.578
and I found some heart medicine
I assume is yours.

15:32.612 --> 15:34.714
Yeah, no, that's mine.
That's mine. Oh, my gosh.

15:34.748 --> 15:36.182
Also, I thought I'd bring over

15:36.216 --> 15:38.050
some fresh oranges
for you and Gayle.

15:38.085 --> 15:40.252
Okay, well,
that is just so kind, Donna.

15:40.287 --> 15:41.387
Thank you.

15:41.421 --> 15:43.556
- You're one of a kind, Garry.
- Oh.

15:43.590 --> 15:46.158
And I just want to thank you
for taking me down memory lane,

15:46.193 --> 15:47.560
you big B word.

15:47.594 --> 15:49.862
- Oh.
- "Buddy."

15:51.498 --> 15:54.233
(Milton) So much has
changed around here.

15:54.267 --> 15:57.436
Uhh, I just wanted to remember
the good old days,

15:57.471 --> 15:59.605
when a shoe shine was two bits

15:59.640 --> 16:03.242
and there were no Mexicans
in the music business.

16:03.276 --> 16:05.177
If you don't mind,
Councilman Milton,

16:05.212 --> 16:07.346
we just need
to search this stand.

16:07.381 --> 16:09.215
Yes! Found it.

16:12.219 --> 16:15.621
"Hi, Andy.
I hate people, but you are okay.

16:15.656 --> 16:17.623
It's weird. Woof, woof.
April."

16:17.658 --> 16:19.091
Oh, my God, babe,
you were so into me.

16:19.126 --> 16:20.359
That's hilarious.

16:20.394 --> 16:21.560
That's it.

16:21.595 --> 16:24.196
It's a dead end.
No more clues.

16:25.165 --> 16:28.000
See me in my office.

16:28.035 --> 16:29.735
If it makes you feel any better,

16:29.770 --> 16:32.805
I had a big crush on you too.

16:32.839 --> 16:36.142
It does make me feel
a little better. Thanks.

16:36.176 --> 16:37.777
Oh, thank God.

16:37.811 --> 16:39.845
Get off my boat!

16:39.880 --> 16:41.047
[applause]

16:41.081 --> 16:42.248
Good afternoon.

16:42.282 --> 16:44.450
I'm here today
to share with you all

16:44.484 --> 16:47.954
my vision for the economic
future of Southern Indiana,

16:47.988 --> 16:51.991
but first, Leslie Knope,
my wife...

16:52.025 --> 16:53.192
has a brief statement.

16:53.226 --> 16:54.226
Hello, everyone.

16:54.261 --> 16:55.361
Thank you. Wow.

16:55.395 --> 16:57.296
How about this weather
we're having?

16:57.330 --> 16:58.731
Very temperate.

16:58.765 --> 16:59.732
Okay.

16:59.766 --> 17:01.767
Recently,
I made an attempt to--

17:01.802 --> 17:03.302
Actually, hang on. Stop.

17:03.337 --> 17:07.473
I'm sorry. This whole thing
just makes me queasy

17:08.675 --> 17:11.077
I love how independent
my wife is,

17:11.111 --> 17:14.113
and because of that,
I will not let her speak.

17:14.146 --> 17:15.580
That came out wrong.

17:15.615 --> 17:19.117
The point is
Leslie is a great mother,

17:19.152 --> 17:21.954
public servant,
all-around person,

17:21.989 --> 17:25.391
and I am tired of everybody
constantly telling her

17:25.425 --> 17:27.560
that she's making
the wrong choice.

17:28.895 --> 17:30.596
So you can say
whatever you want.

17:30.631 --> 17:33.265
I couldn't care less about
the political consequences.

17:34.635 --> 17:36.302
Thank you, Ben.

17:36.336 --> 17:38.671
Well, the first thing
I'm gonna do is say sorry.

17:38.705 --> 17:42.641
I'm sorry that the spotlight
is on me and not on Ben,

17:42.676 --> 17:45.611
because he is going to make
a great congressman.

17:45.646 --> 17:47.179
Second, the Male Men.

17:47.214 --> 17:48.547
Where are you? Ah!

17:48.582 --> 17:50.549
You're ridiculous,
and men's rights is nothing.

17:50.584 --> 17:52.952
Third, I'm now gonna give you
permanent answers

17:52.986 --> 17:55.554
to all the silly questions that
you're gonna end up asking me

17:55.589 --> 17:57.890
and every other woman in this
election over the next few months.

17:57.924 --> 17:59.725
Why did I change my hairstyle?

17:59.760 --> 18:01.961
Well, I don't know, I just
thought it would look better.

18:01.962 --> 18:03.796
Or my kids got gum in it.

18:03.830 --> 18:05.398
Are you trying to have it all?

18:05.432 --> 18:07.767
That question makes no sense.
It's a stupid question.

18:07.801 --> 18:09.302
Stop asking it.
Don't ask it.

18:09.336 --> 18:10.970
Do you miss your kids
while you're at work?

18:11.004 --> 18:12.638
Yes, of course I do.

18:12.673 --> 18:14.040
Everybody does.

18:14.074 --> 18:16.475
And then, you know,
sometimes I don't.

18:16.510 --> 18:18.878
Yeah, and by the way, no one's
ever asked me that question.

18:18.912 --> 18:20.780
No one asks me,
"Where are your kids?"

18:20.814 --> 18:22.114
Or "Who's taking care
of them?"

18:22.149 --> 18:24.083
By the way, who is taking care
of the kids right now?

18:24.117 --> 18:25.217
My mom, babe.
Everything's fine.

18:25.252 --> 18:26.219
Right.

18:26.253 --> 18:27.653
So maybe Leslie doesn't fit

18:27.688 --> 18:30.723
your personal idea of what
a candidate's wife should be.

18:30.757 --> 18:32.291
So what?

18:32.326 --> 18:34.060
That's good,
because there shouldn't be

18:34.094 --> 18:35.227
just one idea anyway.

18:35.262 --> 18:36.395
That's right.

18:36.430 --> 18:37.763
If you want to bake a pie,
that's great.

18:37.798 --> 18:39.465
If you want to have a career,
that's great too.

18:39.499 --> 18:41.667
Do both or neither.
It doesn't matter.

18:41.702 --> 18:44.637
Just don't judge what
someone else has decided to do.

18:44.671 --> 18:47.139
I mean, we're all just trying
to find the right path for us

18:47.174 --> 18:50.810
as individuals on this Earth.

18:50.844 --> 18:52.478
[sighs]

18:52.512 --> 18:55.981
[booing, cheers, and applause]

18:56.016 --> 18:58.217
I'd say that's 50/50
boos and cheers.

18:58.251 --> 18:59.418
Yeah, that seems about right.

18:59.453 --> 19:02.455
Let Ben speak!
Let Ben speak!

19:02.489 --> 19:03.422
He just spoke.

19:03.457 --> 19:05.391
Oh. Sorry.
I-I just got here.

19:05.425 --> 19:06.659
I had a broken bike chain.

19:06.693 --> 19:07.927
My bad.

19:09.040 --> 19:11.333
So I guess we are celebrating

19:11.453 --> 19:15.256
that you trusted me
and I let you down.

19:15.291 --> 19:16.391
Great.

19:16.425 --> 19:19.694
I change my house locks
every 16 days.

19:19.728 --> 19:21.229
That key has been useless

19:21.263 --> 19:24.766
since the second Tuesday
after I gave it to you.

19:24.800 --> 19:27.202
What matters is that I trust you

19:27.236 --> 19:29.771
and admire you as a person.

19:29.805 --> 19:32.774
I will be sorry
to see you leave this town

19:32.808 --> 19:35.343
for many reasons...

19:35.377 --> 19:36.811
not the least of which

19:36.846 --> 19:40.515
is that you created a puzzle
that even I couldn't solve.

19:40.549 --> 19:45.053
And boy, oh, boy,
did you love Andy.

19:45.087 --> 19:46.788
[laughs]

19:46.822 --> 19:49.424
"Woof, woof."
[laughs]

19:49.458 --> 19:51.292
It really is embarrassing.

19:51.327 --> 19:53.394
Oh, my God.
I totally know where the key is.

19:53.429 --> 19:56.064
[shovel scraping]

19:56.098 --> 19:57.632
[clanking]

19:57.666 --> 20:00.969
[laughing]

20:01.003 --> 20:03.271
How'd you remember?

20:03.305 --> 20:05.740
"Woof, woof."

20:05.774 --> 20:06.975
Bark.

20:07.009 --> 20:09.244
Why here?

20:10.913 --> 20:13.281
Because this tree
reminds me of you.

20:13.315 --> 20:16.383
It's strong and quiet

20:17.094 --> 20:19.090
and always here when you need it...

20:20.663 --> 20:22.072
or whatever.

20:22.870 --> 20:25.838
(Ron) I have always felt a
certain kinship with April,

20:25.873 --> 20:27.353
and this is proof
that I was correct--

20:27.913 --> 20:30.048
not the nice things
she said about me,

20:30.082 --> 20:32.517
the fact that I buried
a large amount of gold

20:32.551 --> 20:34.619
under that same tree years ago.

20:36.188 --> 20:38.623
I've since moved it.

20:38.657 --> 20:40.558
Or have I?

20:40.592 --> 20:42.327
[knock at door]

20:42.361 --> 20:43.795
- Elise.
- Oh...

20:43.829 --> 20:45.363
What did I do wrong now?

20:45.397 --> 20:47.865
No, actually,
we at the I.O.W.

20:47.900 --> 20:49.567
loved what you said
in your speech.

20:49.602 --> 20:50.835
Really?

20:50.869 --> 20:54.405
But what we loved even more
was how you, Ben,

20:54.440 --> 20:57.709
gave Leslie a platform
in which to speak her mind.

20:59.044 --> 21:01.014
Congratulations, Ben Wyatt.

21:01.134 --> 21:04.449
You are this year's I.O.W.
Woman of the Year.

21:04.483 --> 21:06.069
Son of a bitch.
