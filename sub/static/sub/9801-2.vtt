10:16.301 --> 10:17.668
Roger that, Roger.

10:17.736 --> 10:19.403
We're giving you a real home,

10:19.471 --> 10:24.241
Not some dark, stinking hole
of woe and despair.

10:24.309 --> 10:25.709
[tires screeching] Um, Skipper?

10:25.777 --> 10:27.244
I think we've arrived

10:27.312 --> 10:30.614
At the dark, stinking hole
of woe and despair, and...

10:30.682 --> 10:32.116
And it's our hole.

10:32.183 --> 10:33.984
We got the gator in the back.

10:34.052 --> 10:35.586
Bring him in.

10:35.654 --> 10:38.188
We've got a nice, cozy habitat
all set up for him.

10:38.256 --> 10:40.824
Oh, well,
that simplifies things.

10:40.892 --> 10:44.261
And so gator watch
comes to an end

10:44.329 --> 10:49.433
As the happy reptile finds a new
home At the central park zoo.

10:49.501 --> 10:51.669
All's well that ends well,
eh, Bonnie?

10:51.736 --> 10:53.504
Right you are, Chuck.

10:53.571 --> 10:56.006
Coming up,
a Manhattan motorist swears

10:56.074 --> 10:59.510
His car was commandeered by--
and I'm not making this up--Penguins.
