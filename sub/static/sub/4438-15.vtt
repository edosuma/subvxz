WEBVTT

00:09.968 --> 00:11.891
( Snoring )

00:13.096 --> 00:15.019
MAN: <i>Princess
Love-A-Corn says...</i>

00:15.390 --> 00:18.314
PRINCESS <i>LOVE-A-CORN:
Buy my 42 accessories.</i>

00:34.576 --> 00:36.749
( laughter )

00:36.954 --> 00:38.297
I know that laugh.

00:38.497 --> 00:40.044
Show yourself.

00:42.501 --> 00:43.798
Well, well, well,

00:44.002 --> 00:46.721
well, well, well, well,
well, well, well, well.

00:46.922 --> 00:49.141
Aren't you a sight
for sore eye.

00:49.299 --> 00:52.018
Stanford Filbrick Pines,
my old pal.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.554
Bill Cipher.

00:53.762 --> 00:54.888
What do you want
from me?

00:55.097 --> 00:56.770
Oh, quit playing dumb IQ.

00:56.974 --> 00:58.396
You knew I'd be back.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.273
You think shutting down
that portal

01:00.477 --> 01:01.649
can stop
what I have planned?

01:01.853 --> 01:03.070
I've been making deals,

01:03.272 --> 01:04.569
chatting with old friends,

01:04.772 --> 01:05.990
preparing for the big day.

01:06.316 --> 01:08.694
You can't keep
that rift safe forever.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.413
You'll slip up,
and when you do...

01:15.701 --> 01:17.169
Get out of here!

01:17.369 --> 01:18.746
You have no dominion
in our world.

01:18.954 --> 01:22.584
Maybe not right now, but things
change, Stanford Pines

01:22.791 --> 01:25.544
Things change.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.769
I have to warn them.

01:33.969 --> 01:36.563
He's coming.

01:55.616 --> 01:58.790
All right, Grunkle Stan's gotta have
some decent board games.

01:58.994 --> 02:01.713
Let's see, Battle Chutes
and Ladder Ships,

02:01.913 --> 02:04.666
Necronomicopoly,
Don't Wake Stalin.

02:04.875 --> 02:07.754
What's this? "What Could
Go Wrong, the board game.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.508
The last players
who opened this box

02:09.713 --> 02:11.511
never made it out alive."

02:11.715 --> 02:13.717
Well, I guess I know
what we're...

02:13.925 --> 02:15.723
This should take up
the next 21 minutes.

02:15.927 --> 02:18.646
FORD: Family meeting.
Family meeting.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.724
- (whimpering )
- All right, Santiago.

02:20.932 --> 02:24.277
You have 24 hours to get these
pugs across the U.S. border.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.105
FORD: Family meeting,
family meeting!

02:26.313 --> 02:29.783
<i>No te preocupas.
Vamos, vamos.</i>

02:29.941 --> 02:33.161
Ah, children.
Come in, come in.

02:33.362 --> 02:35.740
Ooh, mysterious
scrolls and potions.

02:35.947 --> 02:37.574
Are you going to tell us
we're finally of age

02:37.741 --> 02:39.459
to go to
wizard school?

02:39.618 --> 02:41.370
Is there an owl
in this bag?

02:41.536 --> 02:43.880
No. I can assure you,
if there's an owl in this bag,

02:44.081 --> 02:46.334
he's long dead.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.173
Now tell me, children,

02:48.377 --> 02:51.256
- do either of you recognize this symbol?
- ( both gasp)

02:51.421 --> 02:53.719
- Bill.
- You know him?

02:53.924 --> 02:57.144
Know him? He's been
terrorizing us all summer.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.430
I have so many questions
and theories.

02:59.638 --> 03:01.015
Dipper's been
pretty paranoid

03:01.223 --> 03:03.351
since Bill turned him
into a living sock puppet.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.777
The important thing is,
we defeated him twice.

03:05.936 --> 03:08.030
Once with kittens,
and once with tickles.

03:08.230 --> 03:09.982
It was a lot more heroic
than it sounds.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.783
The fact that you've
dealt with Bill

03:11.983 --> 03:13.109
is gravely serious.

03:13.318 --> 03:15.320
So how do you
know Bill?

03:15.529 --> 03:18.829
I have encountered many dark
beings in my time, Dipper.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.784
What matters is, his powers
are growing stronger,

03:20.992 --> 03:22.619
and if he pulls off
his plans,

03:22.828 --> 03:25.126
- no one in this family will be safe.
- ( gasps )

03:25.330 --> 03:27.503
Fortunately, there should be
a way to shield us

03:27.708 --> 03:30.712
from his mental tricks.
A way to Bill-proof the shack.

03:30.919 --> 03:33.138
All I have to do is place
moonstones here, here and here,

03:33.296 --> 03:34.764
sprinkle some mercury,
and let's see,

03:34.965 --> 03:36.842
I always forget
the last ingredient.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.018
Ugh.

03:39.177 --> 03:40.349
Unicorn hair.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.648
That's not, like,
rare, is it?

03:42.848 --> 03:44.145
It's hopeless.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.317
Unicorns reside deep
within an enchanted glade,

03:46.518 --> 03:47.770
and their hairs
can only be obtained

03:47.936 --> 03:49.859
by a pure, good-hearted
person who goes on

03:50.021 --> 03:51.944
a magical quest
to find them.

03:52.149 --> 03:53.571
( Screams )

03:53.775 --> 03:56.244
Grunkle Ford, can I please
go on this quest?

03:56.445 --> 03:58.243
I am literally
obsessed with unicorns.

03:58.447 --> 03:59.744
My first word
was unicorn,

03:59.948 --> 04:02.622
I once made my own unicorn
by taping a traffic cone

04:02.826 --> 04:05.079
to a horse's head.

04:05.287 --> 04:08.461
Are you even looking
at the sweater I'm wearing right now?

04:08.665 --> 04:11.669
Not to mention that I'm probably
the most pure-of-heart person

04:11.877 --> 04:13.094
in this room.

04:13.295 --> 04:15.639
- That's true. She has a point.
- Can't argue there.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.841
So can I go on a mission
to get that hair?

04:18.048 --> 04:20.427
Please, please, please.
I'll give you my blood!

04:20.635 --> 04:22.637
Very well,
but it won't be easy.

04:22.846 --> 04:25.019
- Take this, and this.
- Ooh.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.191
I haven't been in
this dimension for a while.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.440
It's okay to give
children weapons, right?

04:29.644 --> 04:30.736
Come on, dawg.

04:32.147 --> 04:34.525
- (car alarm blares)
- MAN: It's the cops. Gun it!

04:34.733 --> 04:36.781
( Tires screeching )

04:36.985 --> 04:39.829
Candy, Grenda, Wendy,
clear the afternoon.

04:40.030 --> 04:41.703
So what are the odds
she gets that hair?

04:41.907 --> 04:44.285
Unlikely. I've dealt with
unicorns before,

04:44.493 --> 04:45.995
and if I had to describe
them in one word,

04:46.203 --> 04:47.830
it would be "frustrating."

04:48.038 --> 04:51.212
- So what are we gonna do about Bill?
- Follow me.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.515
Welcome to
my private study.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.772
The place where I keep my most
ancient and secret knowledge.

05:09.976 --> 05:13.526
Even your Uncle Stan
doesn't know about this place.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.858
Dipper, come along.

05:16.066 --> 05:17.693
If we can't
Bill-proof the shack,

05:17.859 --> 05:19.361
we're gonna have to do
the next best thing.

05:19.569 --> 05:22.743
We're gonna have to
Bill-proof our minds.

05:22.948 --> 05:24.700
( Qasps )

05:26.910 --> 05:29.413
It's nice to finally
be out on a mission.

05:29.579 --> 05:30.876
Just us gals.

05:31.081 --> 05:32.458
Forget the gal talk.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.465
<i>Tm here to meet, touch,
and! or become a unicorn.</i>

05:35.669 --> 05:38.263
I hear, if you lick
a unicorn's neck,

05:38.463 --> 05:42.513
it tastes like your favorite
flavor in the world.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.185
Candy, I will make sure
you lick that unicorn's neck,

05:44.386 --> 05:46.684
because I care about
my friends.

05:46.888 --> 05:48.765
Honestly, I stopped
believing in unicorns

05:48.974 --> 05:50.692
when I was, like,
five years old.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.394
I'm just coming along
to keep you kids

05:52.602 --> 05:54.070
from walking into
a bear trap.

05:54.271 --> 05:57.696
Stop! This is
the magic part of the forest.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.702
Let's see, the gnome tavern
is over there.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.863
The fairy nail salon
is over there.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.369
It says to summon
the unicorn,

06:05.574 --> 06:07.747
one must bellow
this ancient chant,

06:07.951 --> 06:10.500
droned only by the
deepest-voiced druids of old.

06:10.662 --> 06:12.255
On it.

06:12.455 --> 06:13.752
( Clears throat )

06:13.957 --> 06:16.961
( chanting with
deep voice )

06:17.168 --> 06:19.170
I bet you ten bucks
nothing happens.

06:19.337 --> 06:21.886
- I'll take that bet.
- ( loud rumbling )

06:32.726 --> 06:34.069
(all gasping )

06:34.269 --> 06:36.897
The paintings airbrushed
on the sides of vans were true.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.574
Mother of mothers!

06:47.741 --> 06:49.493
- Dream of dreams!
- No way!

06:49.659 --> 06:52.287
- Eh, eh.
- ( sighs )

06:55.165 --> 07:00.092
Hark. Visitors to
my room of enchantment.

07:00.295 --> 07:02.673
(all gasping )

07:02.881 --> 07:05.350
- ( choking )
- Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh. What's your name?

07:05.550 --> 07:10.147
I am Celestabellabethabelle,
last of my kind.

07:10.347 --> 07:13.100
Come in, come in.
Just take off your shoes.

07:13.308 --> 07:15.777
I have a whole thing
about shoes.

07:15.936 --> 07:19.315
Uh-uh, I'm talking to
all of you.

07:19.522 --> 07:23.493
Celestabellabethabelle,
we have journeyed far and wide.

07:23.693 --> 07:24.740
About an hour.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.663
On a mission to protect
our family

07:26.821 --> 07:27.697
with your magical hair.

07:27.906 --> 07:29.749
This is your chance, Candy.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.827
Lick the neck.
Lick it.

07:32.035 --> 07:35.255
Very well. To receive
a lock of my enchanted hair,

07:35.455 --> 07:38.880
step forth, girl of
pure, perfect heart.

07:39.084 --> 07:40.711
Presenting...
( hums fanfare)

07:40.919 --> 07:42.671
Mabel!

07:42.879 --> 07:45.849
What?! You?

07:46.049 --> 07:48.893
A unicorn can see
deep inside your heart, child.

07:49.094 --> 07:50.471
Ugh.

07:50.679 --> 07:53.432
And you have done wrong.
Wrong, I say.

07:53.640 --> 07:57.019
I guess I do make fun
of Dipper a lot.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.855
And I did just shatter
a window with a crossbow.

08:00.021 --> 08:04.743
Your bad deeds
make me cry.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.160
( Screams )

08:06.361 --> 08:09.991
Come back when you're
pure of heart.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.451
( Whinnies )

08:13.952 --> 08:15.750
The exit is that way.

08:15.954 --> 08:18.423
Shoes, shoes,
take your shoes.

08:18.623 --> 08:21.297
This isn't some... some...
shoe store.

08:23.461 --> 08:25.714
Hey, Mabel, don't
let her get to you.

08:25.922 --> 08:28.345
Yeah, I wouldn't trust
a horse that wears makeup.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.143
No, girls, she's right.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.721
I used to be one of
the sweetest people I knew,

08:32.929 --> 08:34.397
but recently, I've been
slacking

08:34.597 --> 08:36.019
in the whole
goodness department.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.441
Well, today, we're
gonna fix it.

08:37.642 --> 08:38.938
From this moment forth,

08:39.144 --> 08:40.736
I'm gonna do
so many good deeds,

08:40.937 --> 08:43.155
I'll have the purest heart
in Gravity Falls.

08:44.816 --> 08:46.864
That... that bird is fine.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.037
( Beeping )

08:50.238 --> 08:52.332
So what is Bill exactly?

08:52.532 --> 08:53.954
No one knows for sure.

08:54.159 --> 08:57.629
Accounts differ of his
true motivations and origins.

08:57.829 --> 09:00.207
I know he's older
than our galaxy,

09:00.415 --> 09:02.258
and far more twisted.

09:02.417 --> 09:05.421
Not a physical form,
he can only project himself

09:05.628 --> 09:07.847
into our thoughts
through the mindscape.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.800
That's why he wants this.

09:10.008 --> 09:11.885
I dismantled the portal,
but with this tear,

09:12.093 --> 09:14.312
Bill still has a way
into our reality.

09:14.512 --> 09:15.889
To get his hands
on this rift,

09:16.056 --> 09:17.729
he would trick
or possess anyone.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.435
So how do we keep Bill
out of our minds?

09:20.643 --> 09:22.020
There's a number of ways.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.731
I personally had a metal plate
installed in my head.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.616
( Chuckles )
Good one.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.284
( Clanging )

09:28.485 --> 09:29.702
( coughs )

09:29.861 --> 09:30.908
But this machine is safer.

09:31.112 --> 09:32.409
It will scan your mind,

09:32.614 --> 09:34.082
bio-electrically
encrypting your thoughts

09:34.282 --> 09:35.659
so Bill can't read them.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.244
Now say hello
to your thoughts.

09:37.452 --> 09:38.795
Oh, man, I can't believe
I'm with the author.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.417

ignore that last one.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.388
By the way, you never told me
what your history with Bill was.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.511
Dipper, do you trust me?

09:50.715 --> 09:53.059
- Well, yeah, but...
- Then you'll trust that that's not important.

09:53.218 --> 09:55.437
Now focus. It's time to
strengthen your mind.

09:58.056 --> 10:01.276
All right, Mabel, it's time
to strengthen your heart.

When that unicorn
scans my heart,

10:26.042 --> 10:29.717
she's gonna say I'm absolutely,
100%, bona fide...

10:29.921 --> 10:31.514
Not pure of heart.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.307
Boo-ya! Wait, what?

10:33.508 --> 10:35.010
How is that
even possible?

Mabel's a straight-up

10:38.012 --> 10:40.686
Please tell me
what I'm doing wrong.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.688
Doing good days
to make yourself look better

10:42.892 --> 10:44.735
isn't good at all.

10:44.936 --> 10:47.815
Not to mention you're crushing,
like, ten dandelions right now.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.484
Those are basically
children's dreams.

10:50.692 --> 10:53.411
I'm sorry, Mabel. It's not my fault
you're a bad person.

10:53.611 --> 10:55.659
(all gasping )

10:55.864 --> 10:58.242
- ( sobbing )
- Mabel, wait. Come back.

10:58.449 --> 11:00.622
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a 3:00 posing

11:00.827 --> 11:02.795
in front of a rainbow.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.465
( Whinnies )

11:07.250 --> 11:09.719
Come on, Mabel. Don't beat
yourself up over this.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.217
Let's forget about getting
that dumb unicorn hair.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.678
It's not about the hair
anymore, guys.

11:14.883 --> 11:16.260
It's about me.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.561
Being kind and sweet
is what makes me who I am.

11:18.761 --> 11:21.059
If I'm not a good person,
who am I?

11:21.264 --> 11:23.266
I'm not leaving this spot
until I think of a deed

11:23.474 --> 11:25.693
that makes me as good as
Celestabellabethabelle.

11:25.894 --> 11:26.986
But Mabel...

11:27.187 --> 11:28.814
Just leave me be.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.984
Psst.

11:32.192 --> 11:35.696
Guys, if you ask me,
this whole thing is a serious load.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.910
Mabel's, like, the best
person I've ever met.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.866
We tried getting
that hair the good way.

11:40.074 --> 11:42.543
Now it's time
we try the Wendy way.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.000
Are you suggesting violence?
Sabotage?

11:45.205 --> 11:47.333
Mabel's not going
to like that.

11:47.498 --> 11:49.375
Mabel doesn't
need to know.

11:49.584 --> 11:52.087
Look, it's time we stopped
trying to be so "perfect,"

11:52.295 --> 11:53.888
and be who we really are.

11:54.088 --> 11:56.762
We're crazed, angry,
sweaty animals.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.263
We're not unicorns.

11:58.468 --> 11:59.685
We're women!

11:59.886 --> 12:01.479
And we take
what we want.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.681
- Yeah!
- Yes!

12:05.975 --> 12:06.976
Too much?

12:07.185 --> 12:08.687
Here's what
we're gonna do.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.818
( Whispering )

12:15.109 --> 12:18.204
Get me a flagon of your
daintiest honeysuckle, please.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.873
I'm gonna need
to see some I.D.

12:21.074 --> 12:24.499
The cops.
Hit the deck.

12:24.661 --> 12:27.460
I'm lookin' for someone who knows
how to take down a unicorn.

12:27.664 --> 12:28.756
No tricks or games.

12:28.957 --> 12:31.460
We are human.
We take what we want.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.716
- Yeah!
- Fairy dust.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.469
A whole magic bag's

12:37.674 --> 12:39.017
enough to put
a unicorn out cold,

12:39.217 --> 12:40.844
but if I
do you a favor,

12:41.052 --> 12:43.054
you gotta do
something for me.

12:43.221 --> 12:45.019
Just spill it, half-pint.

12:45.223 --> 12:47.942
Butterfly trafficking is illegal
in this part of the forest.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.815
But I like butterflies.

12:49.978 --> 12:52.276
They tickle my face
and make me laugh.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.903
Bring me a bag of butterflies,
and we got a deal.

13:05.868 --> 13:08.462
Two bags of fairy dust,
just like we agreed.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.669
Where do you get this stuff?

13:10.873 --> 13:13.501
Everyone likes sausage, but no
one likes to know how it's made.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.257
You disgust me.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.263
You've got your poison,
I've got mine.

13:17.463 --> 13:18.715
We made a deal.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.675
Yeah, well,
the deal is off.

13:20.883 --> 13:23.306
Freeze. You're under arrest.
Get down, get down.

13:23.511 --> 13:24.478
These butterflies
aren't mine.

13:24.679 --> 13:26.306
I swear.
I've been framed.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.518
Tell it to the adorable owl
we've dressed as a judge.

13:29.726 --> 13:32.024
My cut.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.730
Good deeds,
good deeds.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.489
Oh, that's not good enough.

13:35.690 --> 13:37.237
Come on, Mabel, you can do
better than that.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.866
Oh, sure, sure.
I wish I could travel,

13:45.074 --> 13:46.826
but it's just not feasible
in this economy.

13:47.035 --> 13:48.457
What the hay?

13:53.041 --> 13:55.885
Sleep now. Sleep.

14:01.257 --> 14:03.760
No, wait!
Stop!

14:03.968 --> 14:04.764
Mabel, sh!

14:04.969 --> 14:05.970
You'll wake her up.

14:06.137 --> 14:07.810
But this is wrong, guys.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.516
But protecting
the shack is good.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.234
What?

14:12.435 --> 14:14.858
Doth my eyes
deceive me?

14:15.021 --> 14:18.821
You shall never be
pure of heart.

14:19.025 --> 14:20.777
No, you don't understand.

14:20.985 --> 14:24.364
I just wanna be
good like you.

14:24.572 --> 14:26.745
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you gotta be kiddin' me.

14:26.949 --> 14:28.075
Huh?

14:28.826 --> 14:30.544
Yo, C-Beth, are you
seriously pullin'

14:30.745 --> 14:32.622
this "pure of heart"
scam again?

14:32.830 --> 14:34.377
That is
messed up, man.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.133
Wait. Scam?

14:36.334 --> 14:38.382
Kid, unicorns can't
see into your heart.

14:38.586 --> 14:41.635
All our dumb horns can do is glow,
point toward the nearest rainbow,

14:41.839 --> 14:43.182
and play rave music.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.762
( Rave music playing )

14:46.969 --> 14:49.347
Yeah, the whole
"pure of heart" racket

14:49.555 --> 14:52.024
is just a line we use to get
humans to leave us alone.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.603
Guys, shut up.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.813
All this time.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.732
All this time, I thought
I was a bad person.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.994
- But you're even worse than I am!
- (all gasping )

15:03.194 --> 15:05.617
Okay, fine, so you
learned our secret.

15:05.780 --> 15:07.657
We're jerks, okay.

15:07.865 --> 15:09.333
We have more hair
than we know what to do with,

15:09.534 --> 15:10.831
and we keep it
to ourselves

15:11.035 --> 15:12.127
just to tick
humans off.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.251
What are you gonna
do about it, huh? Huh?

15:14.455 --> 15:16.708
What are you gonna do?

15:16.916 --> 15:17.883
( Gasping )

15:18.084 --> 15:20.428
Whoo!
Go, Mabel.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.630
Join the dark side.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.967
Fight, fight, fight!

15:27.343 --> 15:29.095
So it's a fight you want.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.356
Well, then it's
a fight you're gonna get.

15:39.856 --> 15:41.654
Uh, this is taking forever.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.693
How long have I been
doing this for?

15:43.860 --> 15:46.784
( Snoring )

15:46.988 --> 15:48.786
Why does he have to be
so mysterious about Bill?

15:48.990 --> 15:50.867
I can handle the truth.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.793
<i>I wonder what
Great-uncle Ford is thinking.</i>

15:52.994 --> 15:54.871
<i>Use the machine.
It'll show you his thoughts.</i>

15:55.079 --> 15:56.296
I shouldn't.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.003
<i>He won't know.</i>

15:58.207 --> 15:59.675
<i>He's going to tell you
eventually.</i>

15:59.876 --> 16:00.877
<i>The more you know
about Bill,</i>

16:01.085 --> 16:02.337
<i>the more you can help.</i>

16:02.545 --> 16:04.388
Man, I am really good
at rationalizing.

16:04.589 --> 16:05.886
<i>Yes, you are.
( voice echoing )</i>

16:07.550 --> 16:08.893
Just a little peek.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.095
What are you hiding
about Bill?

16:13.055 --> 16:15.353
( Evil laughter )

16:15.558 --> 16:17.185
<i>Where are these ideas
comin' from?</i>

16:17.393 --> 16:18.895
<i>Who are you working with?</i>

16:19.103 --> 16:20.730
<i>My brother's
a dangerous know-it-all.</i>

16:20.897 --> 16:22.740
<i>He would trick or possess
anyone.</i>

16:22.899 --> 16:25.277
<i>Then it's a deal.
From now until the end of time.</i>

16:25.485 --> 16:27.362
<i>Just plug me into
your mind, Stanford.</i>

16:27.570 --> 16:30.665
<i>Please, call me
a friend.</i>

16:30.865 --> 16:33.493
<i>( laughter )</i>

16:33.659 --> 16:35.377
Ford and Bill?

16:35.536 --> 16:37.004
( Qasps )

16:37.205 --> 16:39.424
You shouldn't
have done that.

16:48.966 --> 16:51.264
Why were you
shaking hands with Bill?

16:51.469 --> 16:54.018
You said Bill could possess
anyone so he could get this.

16:54.180 --> 16:55.397
Careful!

16:55.598 --> 16:57.726
Hand me the rift.
Now, boy.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.561
Why were you really
scanning my thoughts?

16:59.769 --> 17:00.736
Are you Bill right now?

17:00.937 --> 17:02.655
Now just calm down.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.825
Pine Tree. Is that what
you were going to call me?

17:06.025 --> 17:07.698
I was gonna say
please, kid.

17:07.859 --> 17:09.828
Great-uncle Ford told me
to protect the rift.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.156
Get one step closer
and I'll shoot.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.662
I'll erase you right out
of Ford's head.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.288
It's me, Dipper.
It's your uncle.

17:15.492 --> 17:17.086
Trust no one,
trust no one.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.663
- Trust...
- Hand it to me.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.223
Let go of me.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.634
Now just calm down.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.388
Calm down.
Look into my eyes.

17:32.593 --> 17:33.845
Look at my pupils.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.896
It's me, Dipper.
It's me.

17:36.097 --> 17:39.021
I tried to erase your mind.

17:39.225 --> 17:40.818
I'm so sorry.

17:40.977 --> 17:43.196
It's okay, Dipper.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.774
Besides, my mind can't be erased
anyway, remember? ( clanging )

17:45.940 --> 17:47.157
If that really was
Bill, though,

17:47.358 --> 17:48.701
you would've done great.

17:48.859 --> 17:50.782
I should've been more like you
when I was young.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.991
Dipper, I was a fool
to try to hide all this.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.041
The reason I've been
trying to prepare you

17:56.242 --> 17:58.461
for Bill's tricks
is because Bill tricked me.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.747
It's the biggest
regret of my life.

18:00.955 --> 18:02.628
Bill wasn't always
my enemy, Dipper.

18:02.832 --> 18:04.834
I used to think
he was my friend,

18:05.042 --> 18:06.669
long, long 39°-

18:06.877 --> 18:08.720
<i>I had hit a roadblock
in my investigation</i>

18:08.921 --> 18:10.343
<i>of Gravity Falls,</i>

18:10.548 --> 18:12.266
<i>until I found
some mysterious writing</i>

18:12.466 --> 18:14.264
<i>in a cave.</i>

18:14.468 --> 18:16.891
<i>Ancient incantations
about a being with answers.</i>

18:17.096 --> 18:18.973
<i>It warned me
not to read them,</i>

18:19.140 --> 18:20.858
<i>but I was desperate.</i>

18:21.017 --> 18:23.736
<i>I read the inscription
aloud, but nothing happened,</i>

18:23.936 --> 18:25.654
<i>until later that afternoon,</i>

18:25.855 --> 18:27.949
<i>when I had
the most peculiar dream.</i>

18:37.700 --> 18:39.668
Hiya, smart guy.
( voice echoing )

18:39.869 --> 18:41.667
Whoa, don't have
a heart attack.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.043
You're not 92 yet.

18:43.247 --> 18:45.090
Who are you?

18:45.291 --> 18:47.510
Name's Bill, and your name's
Stanford Pines,

18:47.710 --> 18:48.962
the man who
changed the world.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.298
But I'm getting ahead
of ourselves.

18:51.505 --> 18:54.304
Let's relax. Care for a game of
interdimensional chess?

18:54.508 --> 18:57.307
Have a cup of tea.
( voice echoing )

18:57.511 --> 18:59.309
<i>He told me
he was a muse,</i>

18:59.513 --> 19:02.107
<i>that he chose one brilliant
mind a century to inspire.</i>

19:02.308 --> 19:03.730
<i>What a fool I was.</i>

19:03.934 --> 19:07.404
<i>Blinded by his flattery
and games.</i>

19:07.605 --> 19:09.323
<i>He became
my research assistant.</i>

19:09.523 --> 19:11.366
<i>He was free to move
in and out of my mind</i>

19:11.567 --> 19:13.865
<i>as he pleased;
we were partners.</i>

19:18.949 --> 19:20.792
<i>When he told me that I could
complete my research</i>

19:20.993 --> 19:22.495
<i>by building a gateway
to other worlds,</i>

19:22.703 --> 19:24.330
<i>I trusted him.</i>

19:24.497 --> 19:26.920
<i>He said this was
the way genius happened--</i>

19:27.124 --> 19:28.626
<i>with a little help
from a friend.</i>

19:28.834 --> 19:30.256
<i>It seemed that I was
on the verge</i>

19:30.419 --> 19:32.137
<i>of my greatest
achievement.</i>

19:34.090 --> 19:35.763
<i>Until my partner
got a glimpse</i>

19:35.966 --> 19:37.138
<i>of Bill's true plans.</i>

19:37.301 --> 19:39.224
Bill, you lied to me!

19:39.428 --> 19:41.726
Where does that portal
really lead?

19:41.931 --> 19:44.935
( laughs ) Looks like Mr. Brainiac
finally got smart.

19:45.101 --> 19:46.899
Let's just say that
when that portal finishes

19:47.103 --> 19:49.026
charging up,
your dimension is gonna learn

19:49.230 --> 19:50.982
how to party,
right, guys?

19:51.190 --> 19:52.908
( Echoing laughter )

19:53.109 --> 19:55.532
No. I'll stop you.
I'll shut it down!

19:55.736 --> 19:57.363
A deal's a deal, sixer.

19:57.571 --> 19:59.699
You can't stop the bridge
between our world from coming.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.454
But it would be fun
to watch you try.

20:01.617 --> 20:02.789
Cute even.

20:02.993 --> 20:04.916
<i>I'd been betrayed.</i>

20:05.121 --> 20:06.964
<i>I shut the portal down,</i>

20:07.164 --> 20:09.508
<i>severing the link
between Bill's world and ours.</i>

20:09.709 --> 20:11.336
<i>I had to hide
my instructions</i>

20:11.544 --> 20:13.512
<i>so no one could ever
finish Bill's work.</i>

20:13.713 --> 20:16.341
Bill's been waiting for the
gateway to reopen ever since.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.348
All he needs to do is get
his hands on this rift.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.179
To Bill, it's just a game.

20:21.387 --> 20:24.857
But to us, it would mean
the end of our world.

20:27.268 --> 20:28.736
Oh, man.

20:28.936 --> 20:30.859
"Oh, man" indeed.

20:33.023 --> 20:34.696
I'm so embarrassed
about earlier.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.197
I'm such an idiot.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.530
From now on,
no more secrets between us.

20:38.696 --> 20:41.415
We're not the first two idiots
to be tricked by Bill, boy,

20:41.615 --> 20:44.664
but if we work together,
we could be the last.

20:46.537 --> 20:49.416
But what about Bill?
I broke the machine.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.755
Now we have no way
to protect the shack.

20:51.959 --> 20:54.712
Did someone say
unicorn hair?

20:54.920 --> 20:56.843
Uh, no, actually.

20:57.047 --> 20:58.924
Oh. That would've
been perfect.

20:59.133 --> 21:00.806
Either way, we got
some unicorn hair.

21:01.010 --> 21:03.809
Also some unicorn tears,
unicorn eyelashes.

21:04.013 --> 21:05.606
They finally gave us
this treasure chest

21:05.806 --> 21:06.807
to get rid of us.

21:07.016 --> 21:09.189
It can't be.

21:09.393 --> 21:11.191
This is
a great day, girls.

21:11.395 --> 21:12.897
With this unicorn hair,

21:13.105 --> 21:14.527
we'll be able to
completely shield the shack

21:14.732 --> 21:16.609
from Bill's
mind-reading tricks.

21:16.776 --> 21:20.280
- Is it okay?
- Better than okay. It's perfect.

21:20.488 --> 21:22.490
You've protected
your family.

21:22.656 --> 21:25.079
You're a good
person, Mabel.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.877
Thanks, Grunkle Ford,

21:27.077 --> 21:30.422
but today I learned that
morality is relative.

21:30.581 --> 21:31.924
Money!

21:40.841 --> 21:42.093
Perfect.

21:42.259 --> 21:44.478
This will protect us
from Bill.

21:44.678 --> 21:47.397
As long as we're inside,
our minds are safe.

21:49.225 --> 21:51.853
I guess I can't possess
anyone inside the shack,

21:52.019 --> 21:54.272
so I 'll just have to find
my next pawn

21:54.480 --> 21:57.199
on the outside.
