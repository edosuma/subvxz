05:46.840 --> 05:49.638
WHY DO YOU
KEEP BUGGING ME ?

05:49.750 --> 05:52.048
I'M NEVER GONNA

05:52.150 --> 05:53.378
THIS IS NORMAL.

"THE PHYSICAL BODY IS ONLY...

06:50.470 --> 06:52.574

TEARS, BONES
AND DESIRE."

06:52.680 --> 06:55.604

NO WONDER YOU CAN'T
TELL THE DIFFERENCE

10:24.520 --> 10:25.748
BETWEEN VIOLENCE

10:58.450 --> 11:01.658
YOUR FLESH
SHOULD BE ON FIRE

11:01.760 --> 11:04.251

TO CHECK WITH YOU,

12:01.120 --> 12:02.371
BUT I THOUGHT
YOU'D RIP MY HEAD OFF.

12:02.480 --> 12:03.811
DAVID.

12:03.920 --> 12:05.911
I SHOULD
TRUST YOU MORE.

12:06.020 --> 12:08.989
YOU KNOW WHAT,
IT'S OKAY.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.425
IT TAKES TIME.

12:16.200 --> 12:19.021
WE'RE GETTING
BETTER AND BETTER.

12:22.840 --> 12:24.728
WHY DID YOU
AND BRENDA BREAK UP ?

12:24.840 --> 12:26.660
UGH, HONEY.

12:26.780 --> 12:30.272
IT'S PART OF YOU,
I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT IT.

12:31.850 --> 12:33.408
WE WERE SELFISH.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.374
SHE WENT NUTS,
I WENT NUTS.

12:35.480 --> 12:38.813
WE TRIED TO KEEP IT TOGETHER,
BUT IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.582
SO YOU JUST WALKED AWAY
FROM EACH OTHER.

12:41.690 --> 12:43.555
YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

12:43.660 --> 12:46.185
NATE, THAT'S
WAY TOO CLEAN.

12:46.290 --> 12:49.123
BREAK-UPS ARE GORY
AND HUMILIATING.

12:49.230 --> 12:50.265
NOT ALWAYS.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.962
YES, ALWAYS.

12:52.070 --> 12:55.062
I MEAN, YOU GET DUMPED
LIKE YOU'RE NOTHING,

12:55.170 --> 12:56.569
LIKE YOU'RE
FUCKIN' GARBAGE.

12:56.670 --> 12:58.706
THEN YOU CRAWL
AROUND IN PUBLIC

12:58.810 --> 13:00.607
WITH YOUR BLOODY GUTS
HANGING OUT,

13:00.710 --> 13:02.132
CRYING ALL OVER
TOTAL STRANGERS ON THE BUS--

13:02.240 --> 13:03.207
LISA.

13:03.310 --> 13:05.847
NO, IT WASN'T ME.

13:05.950 --> 13:08.771
IT WAS A FRIEND.

13:11.390 --> 13:13.608
SO THAT'S ALL YOU'RE
GONNA SAY ABOUT IT ?

13:13.720 --> 13:14.982
WHAT MORE
DO YOU WANT ?

13:15.090 --> 13:17.524
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED
SO I CAN UNDERSTAND.

13:17.630 --> 13:20.497
HOW CAN I WHEN
I DON'T UNDERSTAND ?

13:20.600 --> 13:21.999
IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVE IT
ALL FIGURED OUT, I DON'T.

13:22.100 --> 13:23.863
IT WAS SERIOUSLY
FUCKED UP.

13:23.970 --> 13:27.189
DID IT HURT ?
YEAH, IT FUCKING HURT.

13:27.300 --> 13:29.791
I KNOW.

13:35.810 --> 13:39.940
( singing )

13:43.520 --> 13:47.115
* WHICH NEVER BORE BLOSSOMS
SINCE ADAM WAS BORN *

13:47.220 --> 13:52.021
* ONCE HE WAS
A TRUE LOVE OF MINE *

13:52.130 --> 13:57.727
* WILL YOU BUY ME
AN ACRE OF LAND *

13:57.830 --> 14:03.769
* PARSLEY, SAGE,
ROSEMARY AND THYME *

14:03.870 --> 14:09.069
* BETWEEN THE SEA FOAM
AND THE SEA SAND *

14:09.180 --> 14:15.540
* BUT ONCE HE WAS
A TRUE LOVE OF MINE *

14:17.450 --> 14:20.613
( rock music playing )

14:26.830 --> 14:28.593
CAN'T WE JUST
OBSERVE ?

14:28.700 --> 14:29.894
NO!

14:30.000 --> 14:31.126
KEITH WAS ACTUALLY
HAPPY THIS MORNING.

14:31.230 --> 14:32.868
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT HIM, DAVID.

14:32.970 --> 14:34.460
I THINK HE'S HOT,

14:34.570 --> 14:36.231
BUT PSYCHICALLY I SEE BIG
FOOTPRINTS ALL OVER YOUR BACK.

14:36.340 --> 14:37.364
SHUT UP.

14:37.470 --> 14:38.164
SHE'S JEALOUS.

14:38.270 --> 14:39.669
BOO ?

14:39.770 --> 14:41.328
HI.

14:41.440 --> 14:42.839
AH, WE'D LIKE TO PLAY
WITH THE OTHER GAY CHILDREN.

14:42.950 --> 14:44.872
PEOPLE !

14:44.980 --> 14:47.119
CHOOSE YOUR
COMRADES WELL.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.575
THEY'LL LEAD YOU
TO GLORY

14:49.680 --> 14:53.650
OR THEY'LL BURY
YOUR ASS IN SHAME !

14:55.760 --> 14:56.658
FIVE ON FIVE.

14:56.760 --> 14:58.557
TWO REDS
SWITCH OVER.

15:00.060 --> 15:02.449
KEITH, YOU PUT ON
THE WRONG COLOR.

15:02.560 --> 15:03.766
NO, I DIDN'T.

15:03.870 --> 15:05.098
YES, YOU DID.

15:05.200 --> 15:06.462
WE'RE ON
DIFFERENT TEAMS.

15:06.570 --> 15:07.559
IT'LL BE MORE FUN.

15:07.670 --> 15:09.035
COME ON,
THEY'RE NEWBIES.

15:09.140 --> 15:12.462
THEY'RE STUPID AND WEAK,
LIKE KITTENS.

15:12.570 --> 15:15.130
HURRY UP, REDS !

15:15.240 --> 15:16.878
I'LL GO.

15:16.980 --> 15:18.447
WOO !

15:20.380 --> 15:21.449
KEITH.

15:21.550 --> 15:22.710
DAVID.

15:22.820 --> 15:24.139
DO WE NEED TO TALK ?

15:24.250 --> 15:25.649
I'M TIRED
OF TALKING.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.218
DON'T YOU EVER
GET TIRED OF TALKING ?

15:28.960 --> 15:30.120
EXCUSE US.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.380
FUCK.

15:38.330 --> 15:39.922
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME
IN FRONT OF--

15:40.040 --> 15:41.098
THE LEADING LADIES.

15:41.200 --> 15:41.939
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'VE BEEN THERE.

15:42.040 --> 15:43.439
I SURVIVED.

15:43.540 --> 15:45.758
THAT WAS NOT MY FAULT,
I GAVE YOU HINTS.

15:45.870 --> 15:47.508
HOW COULD YOU
FORGET "WATERWORLD",

15:47.610 --> 15:48.770
IT WAS THREE HOURS LONG.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.370
I'M NOT THINKING
ABOUT THAT, I'M OVER IT.

15:50.480 --> 15:53.540
ALL I WANT TODAY
IS A GOOD TIME.

15:53.650 --> 15:55.675
IT WAS ONLY
A PARTY GAME.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.418
EXACTLY.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.511
WELCOME TO MY PARTY.

15:59.620 --> 16:01.383
BABY.

16:01.490 --> 16:03.355
BITCH,
YOU SET ME UP.

16:03.460 --> 16:06.156
( laughing )

16:10.130 --> 16:12.189
ANY CHANGES ?

16:12.300 --> 16:14.291
NOPE.

16:14.400 --> 16:15.992
NO.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.101
OKAY, THEN.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.838
YOU, YOU'RE OUT,
SEE YOU NEXT GAME.

16:19.940 --> 16:21.271
OH, FUCK.

16:21.380 --> 16:22.699

16:22.810 --> 16:24.573
WHO THE HELL'S SARGE ?

16:24.680 --> 16:26.671
HE'LL EVEN THINGS UP.

16:36.520 --> 16:38.954
OKAY, YOU GOT
A FEW MINUTES FOR RECON.

16:39.060 --> 16:41.927
GAME COMMENCES ON THE DELTA
AT 14:00 HOURS.

16:42.030 --> 16:44.260
KEEP IT CLEAN.

16:44.370 --> 16:45.689
YES, SIR.

16:45.800 --> 16:48.030
IS YOUR HOPPER FULL ?

16:48.140 --> 16:49.869
OH, YEAH.

16:49.970 --> 16:51.164
OH, YEAH.

16:51.270 --> 16:53.875
I'M SORRY KEITH WOULDN'T
PLAY ON OUR TEAM.

16:53.980 --> 16:56.676
I'M NOT.

17:27.640 --> 17:29.107
OKAY, HATE THIS.

17:29.210 --> 17:30.370
WHERE ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO GO ?

17:30.480 --> 17:31.845
TO MAGIC MOUNTAIN
LIKE NORMAL FAGS.

17:31.950 --> 17:33.372
SARGE SAID THERE'S GOOD COVER
A COUPLE METERS THAT WAY.

17:33.480 --> 17:35.675
I CAN'T DO METRIC CONVERSION
IN COMBAT, DAVID.

17:35.780 --> 17:37.884
GOGGLES DOWN !

17:37.990 --> 17:38.979
SUCK IT UP, LOUISE !

17:39.090 --> 17:40.682
GET OUT THERE

17:40.790 --> 17:42.314
COME ON.

17:51.430 --> 17:54.092
I'M HERE !

17:56.770 --> 17:58.328
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO ?

17:58.440 --> 18:01.409
STOP YELLING
LIKE A FISHWIFE.

18:08.650 --> 18:10.584
YIKES.

18:10.690 --> 18:11.748
SMELL THIS.

18:11.850 --> 18:16.059
YOU THINK THIS
IS OLD HUMUS

18:16.160 --> 18:17.627
OR OLD BABA GHANOUSH ?

18:17.730 --> 18:21.222
I THINK WHEN THEY'RE OLD,
THEY BECOME THE SAME THING.

18:22.900 --> 18:26.097
HMM, YOU BROUGHT
YOUR SHADOW.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.236
HE'S NOT MY SHADOW.

18:28.340 --> 18:29.762
YOU NEED TO GO
TO AZUSA FOR ME.

18:29.870 --> 18:31.861
WHY ?

18:31.970 --> 18:34.905
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THE NAME IS, AZUSA ?

18:35.010 --> 18:38.070
IT'S EVERYTHING
FROM A TO Z

18:38.180 --> 18:40.000
IN THE USA.

18:40.110 --> 18:45.616
AZUSA, THAT'S HOW
YOU GUYS NAME YOUR TOWNS.

18:46.590 --> 18:47.682
WHAT AM I EATING ?

18:47.790 --> 18:48.757
I DON'T KNOW.

18:48.860 --> 18:51.249
WELL, TASTE.

18:53.660 --> 18:55.958
I THINK IT'S CLAY.

18:56.060 --> 18:59.427
LOOK, I CAN'T GO
TO AZUSA FOR YOU.

18:59.530 --> 19:01.168
RUSSELL AND I ARE
SUPPOSED TO GO DOWNTOWN.

19:01.270 --> 19:02.430
FIND THIS PERSON,
CARMEN.

19:02.540 --> 19:05.168
SHE'S DONATING VISQUINE
FOR THE ALUMNI SHOW.

19:05.270 --> 19:07.170
SHE'S A
TERRIBLE SCULPTOR.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.679
IT'LL BE
INTERESTING FOR YOU.

19:08.780 --> 19:10.998
I'LL CALL HER UP AND LET HER
KNOW YOU'RE ON THE WAY.

19:11.110 --> 19:13.169
OLIVIER, THIS IS
REALLY UNEXPECT ED.

19:13.280 --> 19:16.044
AZUSA IS A REALLY
LONG DRIVE.

19:16.150 --> 19:21.019
RUSSELL AND I HAVE PLANS, IT'S
LIKE 115 DEGREES IN THE DESERT--

19:21.120 --> 19:22.519
CLAIRE, YOU'RE

OKAY, LET'S GO.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.228
NO, RUSSELL.

19:34.340 --> 19:36.490
YOU CAN ORGANIZE
MY MONOGRAPHS.

19:36.600 --> 19:40.104
I MEAN, WHAT WOULD
YOU DO IN AZUSA ANYHOW ?

19:40.210 --> 19:43.475
FUCK ?

19:52.790 --> 19:54.951
( door slamming )

19:56.290 --> 19:58.326
I LOVE HER, TOO.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.919
DUDE, MOVE UP !

I'M SO SORRY.

20:33.800 --> 20:34.596
SORRY.

20:34.700 --> 20:38.124
OH, MY GOD,
FRIENDLY FIRE.

20:38.230 --> 20:40.289
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE ENEMY ASS.

20:40.400 --> 20:41.867
QUICK, WIPE IT OFF.

20:41.970 --> 20:43.403
THAT'S CHEATING.

20:43.510 --> 20:44.807
YOU'LL BE KNOWN AS A WIPER
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

20:44.910 --> 20:45.831
I DON'T KNOW.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.168
YOU'RE DEAD.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.030
PUT UP YOUR GUN
AND WALK OUT OF BOUNDS.

20:48.140 --> 20:49.072
THOSE ARE THE RULES.

20:49.180 --> 20:50.807
THERE ARE
NO RULES IN WAR.

20:50.910 --> 20:54.118
AAAH!

20:54.220 --> 20:57.018
AW SHIT !

20:57.120 --> 20:59.645
( laughing )

21:11.500 --> 21:16.290
COME ON, YOU FA-LA-LA MIMOSA
MOTHERFUCKERS.

21:19.470 --> 21:21.370
GIVE IT UP,
JENNY !

21:23.710 --> 21:25.268
FUCK YOU !

21:28.950 --> 21:29.746
OH!

21:29.850 --> 21:30.885
YOU'RE OUT !

21:30.990 --> 21:33.311
DAMN !

21:35.020 --> 21:36.908
DU DES,
YOU'RE STILL ALIVE.

21:37.020 --> 21:38.487
DAVID CH EATED.

21:38.590 --> 21:39.386
PATRICK.

21:39.490 --> 21:40.627
HE'S OUR CAPTAIN,
HE SHOULD KNOW.

21:40.730 --> 21:41.219
I'M A WIPER.

21:41.330 --> 21:42.524
COOL.

21:42.630 --> 21:44.188
YOU SMACK TALK THE OTHER GIRL,
SHE'S SENSITIVE.

21:44.300 --> 21:45.961
I GOT SOMETHING
FOR YOU TO TRY.

21:46.070 --> 21:48.493
DUDES, WE CAN WIN.

21:48.600 --> 21:49.589
YAY.

21:49.700 --> 21:51.406
NO, I DO NOT THINK
THAT IT'S PARANOID.

21:51.510 --> 21:54.502
I RESEARCHED
TODD'S EX-FIANCE.

21:54.610 --> 21:57.078
I SPENT LIKE $150.00
ON THE INTERNET.

21:57.180 --> 21:58.670
DID YOU FIND OUT
WHY HE LOVED HER ?

21:58.780 --> 22:00.008
NO.

22:00.110 --> 22:01.372
BUT I CAN TELL YOU

22:01.480 --> 22:02.970
THE SERIAL NUMBERS
ON HER BREAST IMPLANTS.

22:03.080 --> 22:04.616
IT'S BECAUSE
I'M CURIOUS.

22:04.720 --> 22:06.187
IT'S NOT BECAUSE
I THINK BRENDA'S

22:06.290 --> 22:07.655
GONNA TAKE NATE
AWAY FROM US.

22:07.760 --> 22:11.526
NATE ADORES MAYA,
HE WOULD NEVER.

22:16.100 --> 22:17.965
HE THINKS ABOUT HER.

22:18.070 --> 22:19.321
HOW CAN YOU TELL ?

22:19.430 --> 22:21.364
HE'S TWITCHY
AND FAR AWAY.

22:21.470 --> 22:23.028
THAT'S TODD
WITH BASKETBALL.

22:23.140 --> 22:25.165
AND THERE'S
THIS BRENDA VIBE.

22:27.636 --> 22:27.740
I KNOW
I'M BEING COMPARED

22:27.740 --> 22:29.139
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT I'M BEING COMPARED TO.

22:29.240 --> 22:30.400
THAT'S WHAT KILLS ME.

22:30.510 --> 22:33.104
COME ON, DANA,
TODD DOESN'T COMPARE ?

22:33.210 --> 22:35.178
NO, HE'S NOT DEEP.

22:35.280 --> 22:38.340
I LOVE THAT.

22:38.450 --> 22:39.917
I KNOW WHERE
BRENDA WORKS.

22:40.020 --> 22:43.558
OH, WOW.

22:46.530 --> 22:49.158
I'M DEAD,
DON'T SHOOT !

22:49.260 --> 22:50.921
I'M DEAD !

22:51.030 --> 22:53.021

22:53.970 --> 22:55.335
DEAD NEWBIE WALKING.

22:55.440 --> 22:56.964

22:57.070 --> 22:59.129
HELL YEAH.

23:00.270 --> 23:01.498
GODDAMNIT !

23:01.610 --> 23:02.872

23:02.980 --> 23:04.106
WHO'S YOUR DADDY !

23:07.180 --> 23:08.841
COME ON
AGNES MOOREHEAD.

23:08.950 --> 23:11.544
IS THAT

23:12.720 --> 23:15.018
GET OFF THE FIELD,
YOU FLANNEL SHIRT,

23:15.120 --> 23:16.280
MULLET HEAD DYKE !

23:16.390 --> 23:17.618
OR STAND UP

23:17.730 --> 23:19.482
AAAH!

23:20.730 --> 23:22.493
YOU LITTLE
COCK-SUCKING PANSY !

23:22.600 --> 23:24.465
I'D LIKE TO MAKE
AN APPOINTMENT

23:24.570 --> 23:26.822
FOR A TRADITIONAL MASSAGE
WITH BRENDA ?

23:26.930 --> 23:29.797
I HEAR SHE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE SO GOOD.

23:29.900 --> 23:31.868
She's booked solid
for this month.

23:33.610 --> 23:35.407
THEY ALWAYS SAY THAT,
THEY TRY TO GIVE YOU AN INTERN.

23:35.510 --> 23:36.704
JUST DO A CAROL.

23:36.810 --> 23:37.742
DO A...

23:37.850 --> 23:38.805
OH!

23:38.910 --> 23:40.616
LOOK, THIS IS
TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.608
SHERRY LANSING TOLD ME
YOU'D HELP ME OUT,

23:42.720 --> 23:44.381
DO YOU WANT ME
TO CALL HER RIGHT NOW ?

23:44.490 --> 23:46.082
OR SHOULD I CALL
YOUR SUPERVISOR ?

23:46.190 --> 23:47.214
You're in luck !

23:47.320 --> 23:48.685
There's been
a cancellation.

23:48.790 --> 23:50.451
Can you be here
in an hour ?

23:50.560 --> 23:51.754
AN HOUR ?

23:51.860 --> 23:52.485
I GOT MAYA.

23:52.590 --> 23:53.488
Your name ?

23:53.600 --> 23:56.091
DANA... TODD.

24:04.970 --> 24:06.938
SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU
AND KEITH BEEN TOGETHER ?

24:07.040 --> 24:11.204
WELL, WE WERE TOGETHER
FOR A FEW MONTHS

24:11.310 --> 24:14.177
AND THEN WE SPLIT UP
AND HE WAS WITH SOMEBODY ELSE

24:14.280 --> 24:15.941
AND I WAS...

24:16.050 --> 24:17.586
WELL, NEVER MIND.

24:17.690 --> 24:20.682
AND THEN WE GOT BACK TOGETHER
AND IT'S BEEN ALMOST A YEAR.

24:37.610 --> 24:41.478
I'VE BEEN TALKING WITH
A COUPLE OF "THE PEOPLE."

24:41.580 --> 24:44.344
THEY HAVE SOME
INTERESTING BELIEFS.

24:44.450 --> 24:46.509
THEY CERTAINLY
BELIEVE IN DAIRY.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.441
ALL THE LITTLE ONES
BEG FOR CHEESE.

24:48.550 --> 24:52.509
YES, COWS ARE
SACRED TO THEM.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.849
DID YOU KNOW THEY ONLY
RECOGNIZE THE LOVE OF GOD ?

24:56.960 --> 24:59.451
THEY DON'T
BELIEVE IN ROMANCE.

24:59.560 --> 25:01.619
THEN WHERE DID ALL THOSE
CHILDREN COME FROM ?

25:01.730 --> 25:05.666
WE DIDN'T
GET INTO IT.

25:05.770 --> 25:09.228
BUT AFTER ALL, ROMANTIC LOVE
WASN'T EVEN INVENTED

25:09.340 --> 25:11.069
UNTIL THE 14th CENTURY.

25:11.170 --> 25:12.762
I NEVER HEARD THAT.

25:12.870 --> 25:14.201
PETRARCH.

25:14.310 --> 25:18.007
HE WAS ITALIAN.

25:18.110 --> 25:19.975
ARTHUR,

25:20.080 --> 25:22.116
THE THINGS YOU KNOW.

25:22.220 --> 25:24.688
THIS MORNING--

25:24.790 --> 25:26.189
WE DON'T HAVE
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

25:26.290 --> 25:27.279
YES, WE DO.

25:27.390 --> 25:28.357
WE CAN PRETEND IT
NEVER HAPPENED.

25:28.460 --> 25:29.609
THAT WOULD BE A LIE.

25:29.720 --> 25:31.585
IT WAS TWO SECONDS,
A SECOND AND A HALF.

25:31.690 --> 25:33.021
I DIDN'T PLAN IT,
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

25:33.130 --> 25:36.327
YOUR FRIENDSHIP HAS
SO MUCH VALUE FOR ME.

25:36.430 --> 25:39.627
ANYTHING MORE WOULD BE
UNPROFESSIONAL.

25:39.730 --> 25:40.799
I KNOW, I KNOW.

25:40.900 --> 25:43.630
PLEASE, DON'T
KISS ME AGAIN.

25:43.740 --> 25:47.039
I NEVER WILL,
NEVER !

25:49.380 --> 25:51.769
FRIENDS ?

25:51.880 --> 25:53.973
FRIENDS.

26:03.560 --> 26:04.481
YOU'LL HAVE
TO HELP YOURSELVES,

26:04.590 --> 26:06.956
I'M OUT OF CONTROL.

26:13.500 --> 26:14.990
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU DOING BACK HERE ?

26:15.100 --> 26:16.192
THERE'S NO ACTION.

26:16.300 --> 26:17.369
SHHH.

26:17.470 --> 26:19.267
LET'S GO BUST
A MOVE ON SARGE.

26:19.370 --> 26:20.507
HEY!

26:20.610 --> 26:24.046
DON'T MAKE ME
TELL YOU TWICE.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.768
YOU DIDN'T THINK
HE WAS CUTE ?

26:28.880 --> 26:29.847
NO!

26:29.950 --> 26:31.815
NOT FOREVER CUTE,
JUST FOR THE ISLAND CUTE.

26:31.920 --> 26:34.616
WHAT ABOUT THAT
HOT LAWYER ?

26:34.720 --> 26:36.278
HE DIDN'T FISH.

26:36.390 --> 26:37.880
TRUE.

26:37.990 --> 26:38.581
( gasping )

26:38.690 --> 26:40.089
JEANNE.

26:40.190 --> 26:41.191
ARGH.

26:41.300 --> 26:42.255
TRIPPLEHORN.

26:42.360 --> 26:43.793
UH.

26:45.370 --> 26:48.237
( laughing )

27:00.510 --> 27:04.310
( phone ringing )

27:07.790 --> 27:10.315
FISHER AND DIAZ,
FEDERICO DIAZ SPEAKING.

27:10.420 --> 27:13.548
Mr. Diaz, this is Nurse Raevsky
from Julio's school.

27:13.660 --> 27:15.696
I've been trying
to call your home,

27:15.800 --> 27:17.222
but there's
no answer

27:17.330 --> 27:19.093
and we have a public health
situation here.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.168
IS JULIO SICK ?

27:21.270 --> 27:24.637
Not exactly, but someone needs
to pick him up right away.

27:24.740 --> 27:27.937
He has a raging case
of head lice.

27:30.410 --> 27:31.900
ARE YOU CARMEN ?

27:32.010 --> 27:33.079
YEAH.

27:33.180 --> 27:34.772
I'M CLAIRE.

27:34.880 --> 27:38.111
OLIVIER'S ASSISTANT.

27:38.220 --> 27:39.448
OH.

27:39.550 --> 27:41.586
DIDN'T HE CALL ?

27:41.690 --> 27:43.385
HIM ?

27:43.490 --> 27:44.650
OF COURSE NOT.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.489
TEQUILA ?

27:46.590 --> 27:48.558
AH, NO THANKS.

27:48.660 --> 27:51.663
I'LL JUST GET
THE VISQUINE AND GO BACK.

27:51.770 --> 27:54.762
THE TRAFFIC WILL
GET BETTER IN A WHILE.

27:54.870 --> 27:57.805
OH, I REALLY SHOULD...

27:59.970 --> 28:01.733
THE DESERT IS
DANGEROUS TO YOU.

28:01.840 --> 28:03.603
IT'S LIKE DRIVING
IN A MICROWAVE.

28:03.710 --> 28:06.099
COME ON, HANG.

28:15.760 --> 28:17.079
ARE YOU HIT ?

28:17.190 --> 28:18.020
LET ME CHECK.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.154
NAH, SPRAY.

28:19.260 --> 28:20.284
COUPLE OF BOUNCERS.

28:20.390 --> 28:22.699
SAW YOUR MAN
OUT THERE.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.665
DID YOU SHOOT HIM ?

28:24.770 --> 28:26.226
NOT YET.

28:26.330 --> 28:27.627
DAMMIT.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.492
HEARD HE KILLED
ONE OF HIS OWN.

28:29.600 --> 28:33.138
SOUNDS LIKE HIM.

28:35.640 --> 28:37.699
WE'RE ALL THAT'S LEFT.

28:37.810 --> 28:40.370
I THINK I CAN
GET HIM, BUT--

28:40.480 --> 28:42.243
ONE OF US WILL
HAVE TO DIE.

28:42.350 --> 28:43.988
YEAH.

28:44.090 --> 28:46.888
ME.

28:46.990 --> 28:48.457
YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN
PUT AN END TO THIS ?

28:48.560 --> 28:49.652
I KNOW I CAN.

28:49.760 --> 28:53.355
EVEN IF I'M SHOT,
I GUARAN-DAMN-TEE YOU,

28:53.460 --> 28:55.098
I'LL TAKE HIM
WITH ME TO HELL.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.191
LET'S DO IT.

29:01.770 --> 29:04.568
I REALLY LIKE
YOUR STUDIO.

29:04.670 --> 29:06.809
YOU WORK IN SO MANY
DIFFERENT MEDIA.

29:06.910 --> 29:10.129
THAT'S BECAUSE
I CAN'T FIND THE RIGHT ONE.

29:11.780 --> 29:13.975
SO WHAT DO YOU
DO IN AZUSA ?

29:14.080 --> 29:17.049
I TEACH AT
A CHRISTIAN JUNIOR COLLEGE.

29:17.150 --> 29:20.608
AND I ART.

29:20.720 --> 29:24.178
YOU'RE REALLY GOOD.

29:24.290 --> 29:26.986
OH, FUCK YOU.

29:27.090 --> 29:29.354
YOU KNOW, I WAS GOOD
FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS,

29:29.460 --> 29:30.927
BUT RIGHT NOW,
I'M SHIT !

29:31.030 --> 29:33.521
I'LL GET GOOD AGAIN.

29:33.630 --> 29:36.064
I MEAN, I JUST
HAVE TO BE PATIENT.

29:39.370 --> 29:41.930
OH JESUS.

29:42.040 --> 29:45.339
I WANT IT SO BAD.

29:45.450 --> 29:48.078
YEAH, ME TOO.

29:48.180 --> 29:51.343
SO, WHAT'S THE DEVIL MAN
WORKING ON ?

29:51.450 --> 29:53.589
OLIVIER ?

29:53.690 --> 29:57.922
RIGHT NOW HE'S NEGOTIATING
WITH A COUPLE OF MUSEUMS--

29:58.030 --> 30:01.522
FOR WORK HE DID
IN HIS 20's.

30:01.630 --> 30:04.019
DO YOU LIKE BEING
HIS ASSISTANT ?

30:04.130 --> 30:05.427
YEAH.

30:05.530 --> 30:06.792
YEAH.

30:06.900 --> 30:09.494
HE'S SUCH
A BRILLIANT TEACHER.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.761
I WAS HOPING I COULD BE MORE
INVOLVED WITH HIS WORK, BUT--

30:11.870 --> 30:13.030
OH, I KNOW.

30:13.140 --> 30:14.869
I WAS HIS
ASSISTANT, TOO.

30:14.980 --> 30:19.679
FUCK, FUCK,
FUCK, FUCK, FUCK.

30:19.780 --> 30:22.010
THAT WAS A VERY
CREATIVE TIME.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.714
OH, I'M NOT
FUCKING HIM.

30:24.820 --> 30:26.981
OH.

30:27.090 --> 30:31.129
IS HE HAVING
A BOY YEAR ?

30:55.480 --> 30:57.675
DUDE, YOU'RE TRAPPED !

30:57.780 --> 30:58.940
IT'S OVER, MAN !

30:59.050 --> 31:01.280
FUCK THAT SHIT,
I CAN TAKE YOU BOTH !

31:01.390 --> 31:02.789
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

31:02.890 --> 31:05.950
SOMETIMES I DO GET
TIRED OF TALKING !

31:09.730 --> 31:13.894
AAAH!

31:24.750 --> 31:26.547
OH SHIT !

31:28.750 --> 31:30.547
OKAY, MOVE IT OUT !

31:30.650 --> 31:34.256
NEXT GAME COMMENCES

31:41.700 --> 31:43.497
( knocking )

31:43.600 --> 31:45.591
YES ?

31:45.700 --> 31:48.533
OH, I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT YOU
WERE ALREADY ON THE TABLE.

31:50.270 --> 31:51.532
WHAT ?

31:51.640 --> 31:54.529
THE ROBE, THEY REALLY
SHOULD'VE GIVEN YOU A SMALL.

31:54.640 --> 31:56.676
I THINK
IT IS A SMALL.

31:56.780 --> 31:59.169
NEVER MIND.

31:59.280 --> 32:02.579
THEY SIZE THOSE THINGS
FOR EGOS, NOT FOR PEOPLE.

32:02.680 --> 32:05.387
I'M NOT REALLY
A SPA LADY.

32:05.490 --> 32:08.357
NEITHER AM I.

32:17.060 --> 32:18.527
I CAN COME BACK--

32:18.630 --> 32:21.497
NO, I'M READY.

32:46.030 --> 32:47.622
I'M MARYJANE.

32:47.730 --> 32:48.822
I REMEMBER.

32:48.930 --> 32:51.728
I'M SORRY YOU
LOST YOUR DADDY.

32:51.830 --> 32:53.388
HE'S NOT LOST.

32:53.500 --> 32:56.663
WELL, RIGHT.

32:56.770 --> 33:00.035
HIS BODY DIED IN THIS PLACE,
BUT NOT IN EVERY PLACE.

33:00.140 --> 33:03.928
HE'S FINE IF YOU STEP
A LITTLE THIS WAY AND SQUINT,

33:04.050 --> 33:06.405
YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN ?

33:06.510 --> 33:09.741
YEAH.

33:11.950 --> 33:14.555
HE WAS DADDY,
BUT HE WASN'T MY DADDY.

33:14.660 --> 33:16.150
EXCUSE ME ?

33:16.260 --> 33:17.750
IF YOU MEANT HUMAN.

33:17.860 --> 33:19.885
YEAH.

33:29.700 --> 33:30.894
YEAH, ME, TOO,

33:31.000 --> 33:33.867
COLBY, MUENSTER.

33:33.970 --> 33:35.005
UH-HUH, UH-HUH.

33:35.110 --> 33:38.841
MONTEREY JACK

33:38.950 --> 33:40.406
YUM !

33:40.510 --> 33:42.273

33:42.380 --> 33:43.415
BRIE ?

33:43.520 --> 33:44.782
WHAT'S BRIE ?

33:44.890 --> 33:45.879
DOES THAT TASTE

33:45.990 --> 33:48.458

BLUE CHEESE, UGH.

33:55.030 --> 33:56.725
I KNOW YOUR NAME.

33:56.830 --> 33:57.751

33:57.860 --> 34:02.559
I'M ALMOST

34:46.680 --> 34:47.977
OH.

SORRY.

34:58.130 --> 35:00.155
HERE.

35:04.100 --> 35:05.522
I WAS WORKING ON
YOUR HARA.

35:05.630 --> 35:09.532
THAT'S THE SEAT OF
MIND/BODY POWER,

35:09.640 --> 35:12.006
IF YOU BELIEVE
THAT SORT OF THING.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.829
I DO.

35:14.940 --> 35:18.398
THERE ARE PLACES
WE STORE TRAUMA

35:18.510 --> 35:19.545
AND TENSION.

35:19.650 --> 35:23.245
OUR CELLS KNOW
WHAT WE GO THROUGH.

35:23.350 --> 35:25.944
OUR BODIES REMEMBER.

35:26.050 --> 35:28.951
SOM ETIM ES

35:29.060 --> 35:31.654
JUST A LITTLE PRESSURE...

35:31.760 --> 35:34.354
AND TEARS.

35:39.430 --> 35:43.230
MY LIFE HAS NEVER
BEEN SO GOOD.

35:43.340 --> 35:44.864
I HAVE A BEAUTIFUL BABY.

35:44.970 --> 35:47.029
I'M HAPPILY MARRIED.

35:47.140 --> 35:49.529
YOU'RE LUCKY.

35:49.640 --> 35:52.245
I KNOW.

35:54.180 --> 35:56.569
THE HAPPY STUFF ?

35:56.680 --> 35:58.341
IT'S PRETTY NEW.

35:58.450 --> 36:02.489
WELL, MAYBE YOU JUST
NEEDED A GOOD CRY.

36:02.590 --> 36:05.855
YEAH.

36:11.270 --> 36:13.568
( sighing )

36:15.870 --> 36:17.599
ARE YOU OKAY ?

36:17.700 --> 36:20.601
I'M FINE.

36:20.710 --> 36:24.407
YOU LOOK SAD.

36:31.120 --> 36:34.146
I'M NOT SO LUCKY.

36:34.260 --> 36:36.888
NOT LATELY.

36:41.160 --> 36:42.991
BUT...

36:43.100 --> 36:45.967
I WOULDN'T
CHANGE ANYTHING.

36:46.070 --> 36:49.995
NO?

36:50.100 --> 36:51.328
NO.

36:51.440 --> 36:54.409
WELL, IF YOU
CHANGE ONE THING,

36:54.510 --> 36:59.379
THAT CHANGES
EVERYTHING.

36:59.480 --> 37:03.576
SOME THINGS ARE
THE WAY THEY SHOULD BE.

37:05.590 --> 37:06.943
YEAH.

37:20.100 --> 37:21.533
COME ON,
SWEETH EART.

37:21.640 --> 37:24.666
LET'S GO FIND
MOMMY ABIGAIL.

37:27.240 --> 37:29.902
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

37:33.750 --> 37:35.047
MAYI?

37:35.150 --> 37:36.947
CERTAINLY.

37:38.180 --> 37:39.112
RUTH FISHER.

37:39.220 --> 37:40.949
EVE.

37:43.620 --> 37:46.088
OH, IT WAS
MY MOTHER'S PATTERN.

37:46.190 --> 37:49.523
IT WOULD'VE BEEN MINE.

37:51.930 --> 37:54.660
ANOTHER NAME,
ANOTHER LIFE.

37:55.740 --> 37:57.560
THE SILVER WAS
A WEDDING PRESENT.

37:57.670 --> 38:00.002
THAT WAS
ANOTHER LIFE, TOO.

38:00.110 --> 38:02.078
YOU'RE A WIDOW.

38:02.180 --> 38:03.670
YES.

38:03.780 --> 38:05.543
YES.

38:05.650 --> 38:09.871
MAY I ASK YOU
SOMETHING ?

38:12.950 --> 38:14.087
THE OTHER THREE ?

38:14.190 --> 38:16.658
HOW ON EARTH ?

38:16.760 --> 38:18.011
I WAS GRATEFUL.

38:18.120 --> 38:19.257
HONESTLY ?

38:19.360 --> 38:20.679
YOU DIDN'T KNOW DADDY.

38:20.790 --> 38:23.850
SOMETIMES LESS THAN ONE MAN
IS MORE THAN ENOUGH.

38:23.960 --> 38:27.225
BUT WHEN YOUR HUSBAND
PROPOSES TO OTHER WOMEN ?

38:27.330 --> 38:28.262
HE NEVER DID.

38:28.370 --> 38:30.133
NEVER ONCE.

38:30.240 --> 38:32.959
THEY ALL CAME TO HIM,
THE SAME WAY I DID.

38:33.070 --> 38:34.628
WE ALL CHOSE HIM.

38:34.740 --> 38:37.504
POOR GUY, HE NEVER HAD
ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT !

38:39.680 --> 38:42.672
DIDN'T IT HURT
YOUR FEELINGS WHEN HE'D...

38:42.780 --> 38:44.816
GO UPSTAIRS... ?

38:44.920 --> 38:47.445
IF THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU
WERE DYING OF COLD

38:47.550 --> 38:48.949
AND YOU HAD A FIRE,

38:49.060 --> 38:50.914
WOULDN'T YOU SHARE ?

39:01.770 --> 39:04.705
I DID WORRY AT FIRST,
BECAUSE THEY WERE YOUNGER,

39:04.810 --> 39:07.005
AND I THOUGHT I HAD NOTHING
TO OFFER THAT COULD COMPARE.

39:07.110 --> 39:08.771
BUT I FEEL YOUNG.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.006
OH, SO DO I!

39:10.110 --> 39:12.374
BECAUSE WE ARE YOUNG,
MRS. FISHER.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.971
TIME DOESN'T TELL
THE TRUTH ABOUT OUR SOULS.

39:15.080 --> 39:16.809
ONLY LOVE.

39:16.920 --> 39:19.013
WE'RE ALL CHILDREN
WHEN WE TRULY LOVE.

39:19.120 --> 39:21.213
EVEN DADDY ?

39:21.320 --> 39:23.083
ESPECIALLY DADDY.

39:23.190 --> 39:25.750
THAT MAN.

39:27.860 --> 39:29.953
THEY DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY WANT.

39:30.060 --> 39:33.097
THAT'S WHY YOU
HAVE TO CHOOSE.

39:37.100 --> 39:39.739
( radio playing )

39:50.980 --> 39:55.383
JULIO, I WANT YOU
TO FIND YOUR BROTHER,

39:55.490 --> 39:58.084
GO INTO THE BATHROOM
AND CLOSE THE DOOR.

39:58.190 --> 39:59.885
I'LL BE THERE
IN A MINUTE, OKAY ?

40:01.390 --> 40:04.154
AH, PAPI LOVES YOU.

40:04.260 --> 40:08.663
JUST GO SIT
IN THE TUB, OKAY ?

40:12.410 --> 40:13.638
WHAT ?

40:13.740 --> 40:14.638
JULIO ?

40:14.740 --> 40:17.732
SLEEP ALL DAY,
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

40:17.840 --> 40:19.899
BUT DO NOT FUCK AROUND
WITH MY KIDS.

40:20.010 --> 40:21.147
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

40:21.250 --> 40:22.319
THAT'S RIGHT,
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING !

40:22.420 --> 40:24.684
DO YOU KNOW
WHY JULIO'S HOME ?

40:24.790 --> 40:25.609
NO, I DON'T.

40:25.720 --> 40:27.244
BECAUSE HE HAS
LICE, VANESSA,

40:27.350 --> 40:29.489
LIKE SOME DIRTY
PIG CONVICT.

40:29.590 --> 40:30.579
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ?

40:30.690 --> 40:31.827
WE PROBABLY
HAVE IT, TOO.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.750
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
STOPPED BEING HIS MOTHER.

40:33.860 --> 40:35.828
I HAD TO HEAR IT
FROM THE SCHOOL NURSE !

40:35.930 --> 40:39.627
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S ON
THE HEADS OF YOUR CHILDREN !

40:41.970 --> 40:46.202
IF HE HAS LICE THEN WE'RE
JUST GONNA HAVE TO MOVE.

40:51.710 --> 40:54.406
NO, WE DON'T
HAVE TO MOVE.

40:54.520 --> 40:57.409
OKAY, LOOK,
I BOUGHT THE SHAMPOO,

40:57.520 --> 41:01.559
BUT YOU HAVE
GOT TO CHANGE.

41:05.090 --> 41:06.785
YOU'RE RIGHT.

41:06.890 --> 41:08.221
YOU'RE RIGHT.

41:08.330 --> 41:09.627
I'M A SHITTY MOTHER.

41:09.730 --> 41:11.288
MY OWN MOTHER
WOULD'VE KILLED ME.

41:11.400 --> 41:15.268
HONEY, WHAT AM I DOING,
I NEED HELP.

41:15.370 --> 41:18.737
WE'LL GET YOU
THE HELP, OKAY ?

41:18.840 --> 41:19.966
I LOVE YOU.

41:20.070 --> 41:21.970
CAN YOU FORGIVE ME ?

41:22.080 --> 41:25.140
OF COURSE
I FORGIVE YOU.

41:31.180 --> 41:34.479
OUR KIDS HAVE BUGS.

41:38.320 --> 41:39.719
HELLO ?

41:39.830 --> 41:42.151
OH, HEY.

41:42.260 --> 41:44.728
OH, HEY,
ARE YOU DEAF ?

41:44.830 --> 41:47.719
I'VE BEEN OUT THERE FOR
20 MINUTES YELLING FOR HELP.

41:47.830 --> 41:50.435
I HAD TO DRAG ALL THAT
FUCKING VISQUINE IN.

41:50.540 --> 41:52.064
OH, HELLO.

41:52.170 --> 41:54.809
EVERYTHING
GO SMOOTHLY ?

41:54.910 --> 41:56.309
ABSOLUTELY.

41:56.410 --> 41:58.139
CAN WE LEAVE NOW ?

41:58.240 --> 41:59.798
YOUR VISQUINE
IS IN THE GARAGE.

41:59.910 --> 42:01.616
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO TAKE IT TO SCHOOL.

42:01.720 --> 42:06.089
I'D HELP BUT I'M DINING
WITH THE PROVOST AT PATINA.

42:06.190 --> 42:10.115
WELL, I'D HELP BUT I'M DINING
WITH MY BOYFRIEND AT TACO BELL.

42:10.220 --> 42:11.687
WELL, TAKE IT AFTER.

42:11.790 --> 42:13.587
NO!

42:15.330 --> 42:18.151
AND I REALLY DON'T WANT
TO BE YOUR ASSISTANT ANYMORE.

42:18.260 --> 42:20.125
AND WHY IS THAT ?

42:20.230 --> 42:23.631
BECAUSE ALL I DO IS RUN
PERSONAL ERRANDS FOR YOU.

42:23.740 --> 42:25.264
AND I FEEL LIKE IT'S
JUST TAKING TOO MUCH TIME

42:25.370 --> 42:27.736
AWAY FROM
MY OWN WORK.

42:30.510 --> 42:33.240
FINE.

42:33.350 --> 42:34.772
ARE YOU READY ?

42:34.880 --> 42:36.575
YEAH.

42:39.550 --> 42:41.950
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

42:45.030 --> 42:48.818
NO, ON THAT FIELD
YOU GOTTA GET AROUND BACK.

42:48.930 --> 42:50.989
YOU CHEATED YOUR ASS OFF,
I WAS ROBBED.

42:51.100 --> 42:53.295
OH JEEZ,
IT WAS TOTALLY LEGAL.

42:53.400 --> 42:54.469
TOTALLY.

42:54.570 --> 42:57.733
SO, ARE YOU
GOING OUT LATER ?

42:57.840 --> 43:04.871
YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK
LIKE A LEPRA-CORN.

43:04.980 --> 43:06.049
AM I RIGHT ?

43:06.150 --> 43:08.038
( laughing )

43:08.150 --> 43:10.141
NEVER MIND.

43:11.480 --> 43:14.017
THEY MAY BE HELL
ON THE BATTLEFIELD,

43:14.120 --> 43:15.758
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE
MUCH PARTY STAMINA.

43:15.860 --> 43:17.418
HOW DID THEY EVER MAKE IT
THROUGH THE 80's ?

43:17.520 --> 43:18.885
AND THEY CALL US
CHOIR BOYS.

43:18.990 --> 43:19.979
IT'S SWEET.

43:20.090 --> 43:21.125
OH MY GOD.

43:21.230 --> 43:22.629
WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO MEET JAMES AND KATIE

43:22.730 --> 43:24.129
AND GO DANCING
ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.

43:24.230 --> 43:25.561
THEY'RE, "MARRIED."

43:25.670 --> 43:27.297
HE'S NOT, "GAY."

43:27.400 --> 43:29.539
I'LL WALK YOU OUT.

43:29.640 --> 43:31.232
BE RIGHT BACK.

43:32.270 --> 43:33.567
LOVE Y'ALL SOLDIERS !

43:33.670 --> 43:34.932
WOO WOO !

43:35.040 --> 43:36.029
BYE.

43:36.140 --> 43:38.506
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR HAVING US, DAVID.

43:38.610 --> 43:40.874
IT WAS GREAT.

43:46.520 --> 43:48.909
THAT WAS FUN TODAY.

43:49.020 --> 43:50.214
YEP.

43:50.320 --> 43:52.823
EVER BEEN
IN REAL COMBAT ?

43:52.930 --> 43:54.659
NO.

43:54.760 --> 43:56.625
I WOULDN'T
WANT TO, YOU ?

43:56.730 --> 43:59.062
FUCK NO.

44:02.670 --> 44:05.036
LET'S GET STONED.

44:10.180 --> 44:12.341
YEAH, SURE.

44:16.280 --> 44:18.885
( coughing )

44:19.520 --> 44:20.748
I LIKE DAVE.

44:20.850 --> 44:23.580
YEAH, ME, TOO...

44:23.690 --> 44:25.851
A LOT.

44:25.960 --> 44:29.794
CAREFUL, SOMEBODY
MIGHT TAKE HIM AWAY.

44:29.900 --> 44:34.121
YEAH, GO AHEAD
AND TRY.

44:36.540 --> 44:38.565
DUDE, YOU AND ME,

44:38.670 --> 44:42.174
WE'RE THE SAME.

44:45.010 --> 44:47.274
MAYBE.

44:51.520 --> 44:54.409
I LIVE DOWN
IN LA HABRA.

44:56.090 --> 45:00.322
LOOK, I DIDN'T MEAN TO,
BUT I'M TOO WASTED TO DRIVE.

45:02.660 --> 45:05.026
( laughing )

45:09.700 --> 45:11.167
COULD HAVE
PULLED OUT THE COUCH.

45:11.270 --> 45:13.636
HE WAS ALREADY ASLEEP
ON THE FLOOR.

45:13.740 --> 45:16.231
I'LL GET HIM
ANOTHER BLANKET.

45:19.250 --> 45:21.400
NO.

45:21.510 --> 45:22.772
YOU KILLED ME TODAY.

45:22.880 --> 45:24.575
YOU LOVED IT.

45:24.680 --> 45:26.284
NOT AS MUCH
AS YOU DID.

45:26.390 --> 45:29.484
YOU TRIED TO KILL ME.

45:32.590 --> 45:34.285
MMM.

45:44.640 --> 45:45.959
CAN WE HELP YOU ?

45:46.070 --> 45:48.038
IT'S COLD
OUT THERE.

45:48.140 --> 45:52.440
YOU HAVE ROOM
FOR ME ?

46:00.650 --> 46:03.357
YEAH, YEAH.

46:31.480 --> 46:34.813
HOW DO YOU
LIKE YOUR EGGS ?

46:34.920 --> 46:39.050
UMM, I'LL JUST
HAVE JUICE, THANKS.

46:40.330 --> 46:41.524
MORNIN'.

46:41.630 --> 46:45.293
MORNING.

46:50.040 --> 46:53.362
SO, SARGE,
WILL YOU BE, UM...

46:53.470 --> 46:55.028
PAINTBALLING TODAY ?

46:55.140 --> 46:58.029
NAH, GOTTA
GET GOING SOON.

46:58.140 --> 47:00.279
I'M WORKING
ON MY UNCLE'S CAR.

47:00.380 --> 47:01.301
AH.

47:01.410 --> 47:03.173
SCOOT OVER ?

47:07.190 --> 47:08.509
I LEFT MY NUMBER
NEXT TO THE BED.

47:08.620 --> 47:10.884
SO IF YOU'RE EVER IN LA HABRA,
YOU CAN FIND ME.

47:13.160 --> 47:15.048
THAN KS.

47:21.530 --> 47:24.090
WILL YOU
PASS THE FUNNIES ?

47:31.640 --> 47:34.609
DADDY'S BOOK IS WHERE
HE PUT EVERYTHING HE FOUND

47:34.710 --> 47:36.348
THAT WAS TRUE.

47:36.450 --> 47:39.613
THIS IS WHY WE LIVE
BY THE BOOK OF DADDY,

47:39.720 --> 47:41.847
WHICH SAYS,
"THERE IS NO DEATH,

47:41.960 --> 47:44.781
"THERE IS ONLY BIRTH

47:44.890 --> 47:47.552
"AND BIRTH
AND BIRTH

47:47.660 --> 47:49.594
AND BIRTH."

47:49.700 --> 47:51.725
THE BOOK OF
DADDY SAYS,

47:51.830 --> 47:53.627
"CONSIDER THE TREES

47:53.730 --> 47:55.732
"THAT ALLOW
THE BIRDS TO PERCH

47:55.840 --> 47:58.695
"AND FLY AWAY
WITHOUT CALLING THEM BACK.

47:58.800 --> 48:02.008
"IF YOUR HEART
CAN BE LIKE A TREE,

48:02.110 --> 48:03.907
YOU WILL BE CLOSE
TO THE WAY."

48:05.750 --> 48:08.310
"WHEN THE MULTITUDE
LAUGHS AT YOU,

48:08.410 --> 48:10.048
YOU ARE BLESSED."

48:10.150 --> 48:14.280
AND THIS IS WHAT DADDY
WANTS US TO KNOW,

48:14.390 --> 48:16.779
I DEPART AS AIR,

48:16.890 --> 48:20.087
I SHAKE MY WHITE LOCKS
AT THE RUNAWAY SUN,

48:20.190 --> 48:23.057
I BEQUEATH MYSELF
TO THE DIRT

48:23.160 --> 48:25.424
TO GROW FROM
THE GRASS I LOVE,

48:25.530 --> 48:28.021
IF YOU WANT ME AGAIN

48:28.130 --> 48:30.928
LOOK FOR ME UNDER
YOUR BOOT-SOLES.

48:31.040 --> 48:34.100
YOU WILL HARDLY KNOW
WHO I AM OR WHAT I MEAN,

48:34.210 --> 48:38.909
BUT I SHALL BE GOOD HEALTH
TO YOU NEVERTHELESS.

48:40.850 --> 48:44.741
MISSING ME ONE PLACE
SEARCH ANOTHER,

48:44.850 --> 48:47.717
I STOP SOMEWHERE

48:47.820 --> 48:52.359
WAITING FOR YOU.

48:54.290 --> 48:55.848
I HATE TO SEE
"THE PEOPLE" GO.

48:55.960 --> 48:57.996
I JUST HOPE
THE CHECK CLEARS.

48:58.100 --> 48:59.658
OF COURSE IT WILL.

48:59.770 --> 49:00.828
DADDY WORKED
IN HOSPITALS.

49:00.930 --> 49:01.919
HE WAS A CLOWN.

49:02.040 --> 49:03.530
WHY AM I NOT
SURPRISED ?

49:03.640 --> 49:05.835
THERE'S A BIG MARKET
FOR HAND-MOPS AT SWAP MEETS.

49:05.940 --> 49:08.465
AND THEY'RE ON WELFARE
AND SOCIAL SECURITY.

49:08.570 --> 49:10.003
OH, YEAH.

49:10.110 --> 49:11.702
THAT'S WHERE I WANT
MY TAX DOLLARS TO GO.

49:11.810 --> 49:14.938
I'D RATHER BUY THEM CHEESE
THAN BUILD A BUNCH OF BOMBS.

49:15.050 --> 49:17.348
AT LEAST THEY PRACTICE
WHAT THEY PREACH.

49:17.450 --> 49:21.045
THE PEOPLE WON'T KILL
ANY LIVING CREATURE.

49:21.150 --> 49:23.584
TH EY'VE ALL
HAD LICE FOR YEARS.

49:23.690 --> 49:25.988
WE'LL HAVE TO BOIL EVERYTHING,
BUT I DON'T MIND.

49:26.090 --> 49:28.422
( David )
MOM, THAT'S DISGUSTING.

49:28.530 --> 49:31.454
( Nate )
OH, GOD.

49:31.560 --> 49:33.721
What are you
dressed like that for ?

49:33.830 --> 49:35.991
I'm going to a funeral,
so are you.

49:36.100 --> 49:38.091
Yeah, who died.

49:38.200 --> 49:39.838
Walker Stevenson.

49:39.940 --> 49:43.171
Come on,
gimme a break.

49:43.280 --> 49:47.205
I think these
are people we know !

49:52.150 --> 49:55.881
DID OLIVIER LIKE
MAKE A MOVE ON YOU ?

49:55.990 --> 49:57.582
WHOA, WHOA.

49:57.690 --> 49:58.782
WHAT ?

49:58.890 --> 50:00.118
EVER SINCE I GOT
BACK FROM AZUSA,

50:00.230 --> 50:02.858
YOU'VE BEEN ALL
QUIET AND WEIRD

50:02.960 --> 50:05.292
AND HE REALLY
LIKES YOU.

50:05.400 --> 50:07.061
DID HE MAKE
A MOVE ON YOU ?

50:07.170 --> 50:08.762
BECAUSE HE REALLY
LIKES YOU, TOO.

50:08.870 --> 50:11.168
NO, BUT HE FLIRTS.

50:11.270 --> 50:15.479
YEAH, WELL, HE FLIRTS
WITH EVERYTHING.

50:16.710 --> 50:18.029
WELL, DID HE ?

50:18.140 --> 50:20.199
NO, JESUS.

50:21.250 --> 50:23.741
WE SMOKED A JOINT
AND WATCHED TV.

50:23.850 --> 50:27.013
AND EVEN IF HE DID
MAKE A MOVE,

50:27.120 --> 50:30.009
HELLO, I'M NOT GAY,

50:30.120 --> 50:32.588
I'M YOUR
FUCKING BOYFRIEND.

50:38.960 --> 50:41.292
C'MERE.

50:42.540 --> 50:45.065
C'MERE.

50:54.880 --> 50:56.347
LOOK...

50:56.450 --> 50:59.385
IF HE EVER DOES ANYTHING,
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME, OKAY ?

50:59.490 --> 51:00.411
YEAH.

51:00.520 --> 51:03.318
UGH.

51:10.460 --> 51:12.769
SO, WE HAVE TO BOIL
EVERYTHING.

51:12.870 --> 51:14.462
IF MAYA GETS LICE--

51:14.570 --> 51:18.597
DON'T WORRY,
