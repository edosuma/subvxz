WEBVTT

01:21.551 --> 01:22.586
- Okay.

01:45.413 --> 01:47.172
- Christian is running
a few minutes late.

01:47.275 --> 01:48.448
Thank you for your patience.

01:48.551 --> 01:50.103
We will start the meeting
once he arrives.

01:51.827 --> 01:53.068
- My mom is calling.

01:53.172 --> 01:54.344
That's weird, she never calls.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.000
- Can I talk to Linda?
I love her.

01:56.103 --> 01:57.862
- Jake, stay away from my mom.

01:57.965 --> 01:59.206
- Matt, first of all,

01:59.310 --> 02:00.172
it's not sexual.

02:00.275 --> 02:01.758
Secondly, love is love,

02:01.862 --> 02:03.103
and when you know, you know.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.068
I feel like in another lifetime,
I could've married Linda.

02:05.172 --> 02:06.103
Then I would've been your dad.

02:06.206 --> 02:08.379
- What game
are you playing, Daddy?

02:08.482 --> 02:09.931
- It's called "2071."

02:10.034 --> 02:11.241
It's set in a dystopian future

02:11.344 --> 02:13.137
where you get to
murder people with a sword.

02:13.241 --> 02:15.068
It's extremely violent,
and it soothes my soul.

02:15.172 --> 02:16.379
I was supposed to

02:16.482 --> 02:18.103
take the day off
and go on an ayahuasca trip

02:18.206 --> 02:19.413
with my best friends,

02:19.517 --> 02:20.965
but I'm sure
this meeting will send me on

02:21.068 --> 02:24.000
an equally terrifying,
introspective anxiety cyclone.

02:24.103 --> 02:26.517
- I feel like I'm wasting
my life at meetings like this.

02:26.620 --> 02:28.068
- That's absolutely
what's happening...

02:28.172 --> 02:29.379
but if it makes you feel
any better,

02:29.482 --> 02:30.551
there's no way
not to waste your life.

02:30.655 --> 02:32.275
The best you can do
is find something you love,

02:32.379 --> 02:35.172
and work so hard and so long
at it that it eventually

02:35.275 --> 02:37.172
becomes something
you mostly complain about.

02:37.275 --> 02:39.310
- All I want out of life
is to lose my mind

02:39.413 --> 02:41.172
on a drug I don't understand

02:41.275 --> 02:43.448
and then justify it
as a spiritual awakening.

02:43.551 --> 02:45.620
- Fuck this fucking game.

02:48.413 --> 02:50.689
- My mom is calling again.

02:50.793 --> 02:52.275
- Can you believe
they called this meeting

02:52.379 --> 02:54.206
on the exact day
Adele tickets went on sale?

02:54.310 --> 02:56.655
- Adele is what sent me into,
but got me out of

02:56.758 --> 02:58.379
my last three bouts
of clinical depression.

02:58.482 --> 03:00.655
- I never took you
for an Adele fan, Baron.

03:00.758 --> 03:02.275
- Well, I'm not.

03:02.379 --> 03:04.137
I'm gonna buy as many tickets
as possible online

03:04.241 --> 03:05.034
and sell them
at a massive markup.

03:05.137 --> 03:07.241
People will give

03:07.344 --> 03:09.620
their first born child
to see Adele,

03:09.724 --> 03:11.413
and her music is so powerful,

03:11.517 --> 03:12.620
it'll help them
get over the loss.

03:13.517 --> 03:15.241
- Now my dad is calling?

03:15.344 --> 03:16.758
My parents are divorced.

03:16.862 --> 03:18.413
The last time I got
this many calls from them

03:18.517 --> 03:20.379
at the same time was
when my grandpa stole a car

03:20.482 --> 03:22.172
and drove it off a cliff
on purpose.

03:22.275 --> 03:23.758
- Just go call your parents.

03:23.862 --> 03:25.758
The meeting won't start
till Christian gets here.

03:25.862 --> 03:27.206
- Okay.

03:30.137 --> 03:31.448
- He was cursing like a sailor,
so then I said to him...

03:31.551 --> 03:33.482
"Frank, I got news for you.

03:33.586 --> 03:36.275
Wives are bad."

03:36.379 --> 03:38.551
Women:
can't live with them.

03:38.655 --> 03:39.965
And that's the end
of that saying.

03:41.689 --> 03:44.310
Uh, Bill, let's try
to keep that kind of talk

03:44.413 --> 03:45.655
to a minimum today.

03:45.758 --> 03:47.517
I mean, these lawsuits against
you are getting expensive.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.103
- Hello, everyone.

03:50.206 --> 03:51.965
I'd like to introduce you
to Bill Hathaway,

03:52.068 --> 03:53.206
who's been with Hampton DeVille
for over 30 years,

03:53.310 --> 03:56.448
and currently sits on
our board of directions.

03:56.551 --> 03:59.448
- Hampton DeVille
is my middle name.

03:59.551 --> 04:01.103
Just kidding.
It's Margaret.

04:01.206 --> 04:02.620
- Just kidding!

04:02.724 --> 04:05.034
That's a woman's name.

04:05.137 --> 04:06.655
Anyway, here we go.

04:06.758 --> 04:08.344
- Bill Hathaway is a nightmare.

04:08.448 --> 04:10.000
He thinks it's 1975.

04:10.103 --> 04:11.896
The last time he talked to me,
he said I would look prettier

04:12.000 --> 04:13.379
if I were massaging his groin.

04:13.482 --> 04:14.793
- He said
the exact same thing to me.

04:14.896 --> 04:16.448
- Which brings me to
the reason why I called

04:16.551 --> 04:17.724
all of you here today:

04:17.827 --> 04:19.793
to discuss five new ideas
that I--

04:20.655 --> 04:22.275
One moment.

04:24.172 --> 04:24.931
Oh, wow.
I have to take this call.

04:25.034 --> 04:27.000
I might be a minute.

04:28.620 --> 04:31.310
I need you to take charge
until I get back.

04:31.413 --> 04:32.379
I'm counting on you.

04:35.620 --> 04:36.517
- All right, everyone.
- All right.

04:36.620 --> 04:37.517
both: So let's get started.

04:37.620 --> 04:38.586
- Oh!
- Oh, Christian put...

04:38.689 --> 04:40.310
- Me.
- No, well, he pointed at...

04:40.413 --> 04:41.310
both: Me.
- Me.

04:41.413 --> 04:42.413
- Me.
- Mimi?

04:42.517 --> 04:43.896
both: I'm in charge.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.172
- Why would Christian
point to you when I'm his--

04:45.275 --> 04:46.551
Can somebody pour

04:46.655 --> 04:48.103
hot coffee all over my face?

04:48.206 --> 04:49.310
- John...
both: I have been waiting

04:49.413 --> 04:50.793
for the chance to take the lead
for my entire...

04:50.896 --> 04:52.172
- Life, including when I was...
- Professional career...

04:52.275 --> 04:53.551
- A sinless baby in heaven...
- But nobody will let me...

04:53.655 --> 04:54.896
- Before I was born!
- Because I have a vagina!

04:55.000 --> 04:56.482
And you wear glasses,
you have inferior vision.

04:56.586 --> 04:57.620
- Okay, everyone,

04:57.724 --> 04:59.000
let's just take two...
- Yeah.

04:59.103 --> 05:00.310
- While John and I have...
- Everyone, take two.

05:00.413 --> 05:02.241
- A quick convo.
- Sidebar convo here.

05:03.965 --> 05:05.862
- Now my sister's texting asking
why I haven't called Mom and Dad

05:05.965 --> 05:07.862
about Grandma Dorothy?

05:07.965 --> 05:09.551
Oh, my God.

05:09.655 --> 05:10.965
Is Grandma Dorothy dead?

05:11.068 --> 05:13.620
- Okay, since we don't know
who he pointed at,

05:13.724 --> 05:16.482
let's just
run the meeting together.

05:16.586 --> 05:17.517
Now what five ideas
was he talking about?

05:17.620 --> 05:20.724
- No clue.
All I know is I'm scared

05:20.827 --> 05:22.655
and I need to pee,
but the nervous energy

05:22.758 --> 05:25.275
from holding it in is
what's fueling me right now.

05:25.379 --> 05:26.586
- Okay.

05:26.689 --> 05:28.034
Let's just do something
so that senile lump

05:28.137 --> 05:29.034
doesn't report to Christian
that we dropped the ball.

05:29.137 --> 05:31.068
- Yeah. Hey.
- Yeah?

05:31.172 --> 05:32.172
- We're a team.

05:32.275 --> 05:34.862
- Hey, you, the one
without the hair.

05:34.965 --> 05:37.068
Come on,
let's get this thing rolling.

05:37.172 --> 05:38.241
- He knows my name?

05:38.344 --> 05:41.068
- Be a man and take charge.

05:41.172 --> 05:42.379
- Absolutely, Bill.

05:42.482 --> 05:44.379
Thank you for
the vote of confidence.

05:44.482 --> 05:45.310
Okay, everyone.

05:45.413 --> 05:46.655
Enough dillydally.

05:46.758 --> 05:48.344
I'm gonna get things started.

05:48.448 --> 05:49.896
- John and Kate
have definitely had sex.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.241
- How do you know?

05:52.344 --> 05:54.172
- Working in HR,
I've developed a sixth sense

05:54.275 --> 05:55.724
for people's sex lives.

05:55.827 --> 05:57.586
I'll bet there's
a crazy Venn diagram

05:57.689 --> 05:59.103
of sexual encounters
in this room.

05:59.206 --> 06:02.413
- It is weird to think that all
these people wearing nice suits,

06:02.517 --> 06:04.724
drinking coffee, talking calmly,

06:04.827 --> 06:06.931
have all had penises
and vaginas in their mouths.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.206
Literally, all of them.

06:09.310 --> 06:10.896
- Tailored suit's the only thing
hiding the fact that

06:11.000 --> 06:13.448
we're all hairy mammals
with horrifying genitalia.

06:13.551 --> 06:15.413
- I mean, yeah,
my genitalia is fine,

06:15.517 --> 06:16.931
but I understand
what you're saying.

06:17.034 --> 06:19.172
- My genitalia is horrifying.
- So...

06:19.275 --> 06:20.379
let's get...

06:22.068 --> 06:23.379
Ha-ha-ha.

06:23.482 --> 06:25.275
L-O-L.
L-O-L.

06:25.379 --> 06:27.310
Very funny, guys.

06:27.413 --> 06:28.689
And blastoff!

06:28.793 --> 06:32.172
Let's start by asking
a simple question:

06:32.275 --> 06:36.310
why are we here?

06:36.413 --> 06:38.310
- Shouldn't you know
the answer to that?

06:38.413 --> 06:39.517
- Of course, Baron.

06:39.620 --> 06:40.827
Because that was
a rhetorical question.

06:40.931 --> 06:42.965
- Okay.

06:43.068 --> 06:45.517
We just need to brainstorm
five ideas.

06:45.620 --> 06:47.413
- But to be safe,
let's come up with 50.

06:47.517 --> 06:48.241
- Let's make it 100!
- Any idea is welcome

06:48.344 --> 06:50.344
when brainstorming.

06:50.448 --> 06:51.758
Literally anything you say
will be discussed

06:51.862 --> 06:53.206
in detail without criticism.

06:53.310 --> 06:55.620
- My brain just stormed an idea.

06:55.724 --> 06:56.517
How about
we call off this meeting

06:56.620 --> 06:58.275
until Christian gets back?

06:58.379 --> 06:59.620
- Come on, that's a bad idea.

06:59.724 --> 07:02.000
- I thought we weren't gonna
criticize ideas.

07:02.103 --> 07:03.413
- Fine. Yeah.
Let's put it on the board.

07:03.517 --> 07:05.965
- Any other ideas?

07:06.068 --> 07:07.448
- We're going into
a brainstorm hole.

07:07.551 --> 07:09.379
I can literally
say anything right now.

07:09.482 --> 07:11.034
Racism.
- Racism.

07:11.137 --> 07:12.034
Great idea.
- Nice.

07:12.137 --> 07:13.620
- Jesus Christ,
this is a nightmare.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.000
- What's that, Matt?

07:15.103 --> 07:17.206
- Oh, I just said
that this is a nightmare.

07:17.310 --> 07:19.068
- This is a nightmare.
Great.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.758
- You know, this reminds me
of when I was selling

07:20.862 --> 07:23.551
cigarettes wholesale
to health food stores

07:23.655 --> 07:25.137
back in the '70s.

07:25.241 --> 07:26.655
At the time, we didn't know
they were bad for you.

07:26.758 --> 07:29.965
Or, actually, we did know,
but we kept a lid on it.

07:30.068 --> 07:32.448
Back then, you were allowed
to have secrets.

07:32.551 --> 07:34.103
Secrets from the government,
from your wife.

07:34.206 --> 07:36.517
It didn't matter!

07:36.620 --> 07:38.862
- I hope my grandma died
doing what she loved most:

07:38.965 --> 07:41.241
sitting in her chair,
worrying that I'm gay.

07:41.344 --> 07:42.620
- Your grandma's lucky.

07:42.724 --> 07:44.586
When you're dead, nobody
expects anything from you.

07:44.689 --> 07:46.103
Death is
the retirement package you get

07:46.206 --> 07:47.793
for a lifetime full
of pain and suffering.

07:47.896 --> 07:49.965
- That's why I say
you should always bring a gun

07:50.068 --> 07:51.034
to a knife fight,

07:51.137 --> 07:52.655
or a knife to a gun fight,
if you wish.

07:52.758 --> 07:55.137
Now, you might die,
but at least no one can say

07:55.241 --> 07:57.931
you weren't interesting.

07:58.034 --> 07:59.000
- Thank you...

07:59.103 --> 08:01.172
so much, Bill.

08:01.275 --> 08:02.241
Very helpful.

08:02.344 --> 08:03.862
Does anyone have
a coherent idea?

08:07.103 --> 08:08.965
- Hey, guys?

08:09.068 --> 08:11.068
Guys!

08:11.172 --> 08:12.931
Can we get off our phones
and focus up?

08:13.034 --> 08:15.758
- You know, we didn't
used to have phones in meetings.

08:15.862 --> 08:17.896
Back then, if you wanted
to send someone a nudie pic,

08:18.000 --> 08:21.689
you had to show up at their door
wearing just a trench coat

08:21.793 --> 08:24.206
and show them what you got!

08:24.310 --> 08:25.655
Your thoughts?

08:25.758 --> 08:27.827
- Yeah, well, Bill makes
a good point here.

08:27.931 --> 08:28.827
Um...

08:28.931 --> 08:30.379
Oh.

08:30.482 --> 08:31.551
Here's an idea.

08:31.655 --> 08:32.862
How about
we try something new

08:32.965 --> 08:35.344
and have everyone in the room

08:35.448 --> 08:37.137
put their phones

08:37.241 --> 08:38.241
in this box.

08:38.344 --> 08:39.551
- No!

08:43.379 --> 08:44.724
- Thank you. You'll get it back
at the end of the semester.

08:44.827 --> 08:46.517
- Having your phone taken away
from you is like having

08:46.620 --> 08:48.000
a civil liberty stripped away.

08:48.103 --> 08:49.689
It's just inhumane.

08:49.793 --> 08:52.620
- Baron.

08:54.310 --> 08:55.206
Baron?

08:59.241 --> 09:01.344
Yeah.

09:01.448 --> 09:02.965
Thank you.

09:03.068 --> 09:03.965
Back pocket.

09:04.068 --> 09:06.896
And the other.

09:11.310 --> 09:12.241
Okay.

09:14.965 --> 09:17.068
Stand up.

09:18.827 --> 09:20.758
- Sorry I have to do this,
but...

09:20.862 --> 09:23.068
just want to a have
a nice, focused meeting.

09:23.172 --> 09:25.931
Oh?

09:29.137 --> 09:31.379
That's mine.

09:32.551 --> 09:33.310
- My dad's finally responding.

09:33.413 --> 09:35.379
Oh.

09:40.068 --> 09:42.206
- Thank you.

09:42.310 --> 09:43.172
Now!

09:43.275 --> 09:45.448
Where were we?

09:45.551 --> 09:46.758
Bill, you were saying something.

09:46.862 --> 09:49.379
- Actually, uh,
I was gonna say something.

09:49.482 --> 09:52.448
- Yet here I am,
saying something.

09:52.551 --> 09:54.724
This reminds me of
a time I was a child...

09:54.827 --> 09:55.862
- And my mother said,

09:55.965 --> 09:57.344
"You'll never amount
to anything,"

09:57.448 --> 10:00.896
and I felt hurt till I realized
she was talking to my father.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.896
There he stood
with his party dress on...

10:04.034 --> 10:06.172
Anyway...

10:06.275 --> 10:07.655
- How long have we been here?

10:07.758 --> 10:08.448
- Without our phones,
there's no way to measure

10:08.551 --> 10:09.448
the passage of time.

10:09.551 --> 10:12.551
It could be years,
decades even.

10:12.655 --> 10:13.827
- Okay! I think
we're really starting to get...

10:13.931 --> 10:15.517
somewhere.

10:15.620 --> 10:19.310
Christian should be back
any minute, so...

10:19.413 --> 10:20.655
let's just keep going.

10:20.758 --> 10:22.689
- Maybe I'll kill him.

10:22.793 --> 10:26.000
Could I handle it
emotionally, though?

10:26.103 --> 10:27.655
Yes.

10:27.758 --> 10:29.310
But how would I do it?

10:29.413 --> 10:30.655
Strangling.

10:30.758 --> 10:32.379
But why would I kill him?

10:32.482 --> 10:33.275
Because nature
is a brutal mother,

10:33.379 --> 10:35.448
and everyone must die.

10:35.551 --> 10:36.793
Hm!

10:36.896 --> 10:38.517
- There was so much
I wanted to say

10:38.620 --> 10:40.827
to my grandma
before she died.

10:40.931 --> 10:41.758
Actually, that's not true.

10:41.862 --> 10:43.758
We had nothing in common.

10:43.862 --> 10:46.413
Wait, am I even sad she's dead?

10:46.517 --> 10:48.413
Yes...I am.

10:48.517 --> 10:49.793
Okay, good.

10:49.896 --> 10:51.344
- If anyone knew
the horrible thoughts

10:51.448 --> 10:53.620
in my head,
I would 100% be in jail.

10:53.724 --> 10:55.655
Thank God
nobody knows my thoughts.

10:55.758 --> 10:57.137
But I guess on some level
it also means

10:57.241 --> 10:58.827
I'll always be alone.

10:58.931 --> 10:59.655
Oh, well.

10:59.758 --> 11:01.655
- This meeting is bullshit

11:01.758 --> 11:03.172
and I deserve better than this.

11:03.275 --> 11:05.034
Maybe I don't.

11:05.137 --> 11:08.344
Maybe I'm a loser and this is
exactly what I deserve.

11:08.448 --> 11:11.724
No, I'm not a loser.

11:11.827 --> 11:14.379
That's why I needed to do
ayahuasca this weekend:

11:14.482 --> 11:16.586
to learn that I'm not a loser.

11:16.689 --> 11:17.793
- Why did I lie
about the reason

11:17.896 --> 11:19.172
I'm getting Adele tickets?

11:19.275 --> 11:20.413
I love Adele.

11:20.517 --> 11:23.000
She sings directly to my soul.

11:23.103 --> 11:24.965
Why can't I admit
the music I like?

11:25.068 --> 11:25.862
I'm in my 30s.

11:25.965 --> 11:27.620
It's time to be myself.

11:27.724 --> 11:30.310
I'm buying those tickets
for me, God damn it!

11:30.413 --> 11:33.724
I gotta get out of this
meeting.

11:39.310 --> 11:41.517
- It's crazy that
I can have thoughts

11:41.620 --> 11:43.827
while speaking out loud.

11:43.931 --> 11:46.000
But wait,
who am I speaking to right now?

11:46.103 --> 11:48.137
Myself?

11:48.241 --> 11:50.931
Because
if I'm speaking to myself,

11:51.034 --> 11:52.448
who's doing the speaking?

11:52.551 --> 11:55.275
If I do propose,

11:55.379 --> 11:59.000
I'm going to do
something romantic, like...

11:59.103 --> 12:02.034
have a blunt conversation about
the bleak realities of marriage.

12:03.827 --> 12:04.862
I don't know how I started
talking about that.

12:04.965 --> 12:06.206
Did someone even...

12:06.310 --> 12:07.344
who said marriage?

12:07.448 --> 12:08.517
- Absolutely.

12:08.620 --> 12:09.482
- Okay, everyone.

12:09.586 --> 12:11.310
Let's get back on track

12:11.413 --> 12:13.206
and discuss the five ideas

12:13.310 --> 12:14.241
that Christian asked for.

12:14.344 --> 12:15.965
- Kate, I gotta
stop you right there

12:16.068 --> 12:18.206
'cause I have something to say,
and my voice is deeper

12:18.310 --> 12:19.551
and louder than yours.

12:19.655 --> 12:21.172
So here we go!

12:21.275 --> 12:23.137
- I'm sad the only dating
options for my grandma

12:23.241 --> 12:24.620
were men like Bill.

12:24.724 --> 12:26.137
- It hasn't gotten much better.

12:26.241 --> 12:28.655
Now the options are men
like you and Jake.

12:28.758 --> 12:29.862
- Great point.
- So then I said to him,

12:29.965 --> 12:33.689
"Son, your mother and I
are getting a divorce,

12:33.793 --> 12:37.206
and it is your fault,
so please apologize to us."

12:37.310 --> 12:38.689
And to his credit, he did.

12:38.793 --> 12:41.344
I haven't talked to him
in years.

12:42.586 --> 12:43.965
Often wondered
what happened to him...

13:08.448 --> 13:10.689
- Okay, I think I figured out

13:10.793 --> 13:12.379
who all has had sex
in this room.

13:12.482 --> 13:13.586
- Who?

13:13.689 --> 13:14.482
- Those two
are currently having sex,

13:14.586 --> 13:16.758
but trying to play it cool.

13:16.862 --> 13:18.172
- The point is that marriage...

13:18.275 --> 13:19.517
- Who else?

13:19.620 --> 13:22.172
- She wants to have sex with...

13:22.275 --> 13:23.931
something...

13:24.034 --> 13:26.758
and he wants
to have sex with me.

13:26.862 --> 13:28.827
- And connect the dots
previous,

13:28.931 --> 13:30.862
and it's not just the ideas
that live within,

13:30.965 --> 13:34.482
ideas that are critical
to examine in a deep way,

13:34.586 --> 13:36.862
but it's also
the peripheral ideas

13:36.965 --> 13:39.896
that kind of live
next to the main idea,

13:40.000 --> 13:40.793
if you know what I mean.

13:42.758 --> 13:44.000
If you think of
the main ideas being a city,

13:44.103 --> 13:45.379
the other ideas are suburbs,

13:45.482 --> 13:47.689
or sub-ideas, in a way,

13:47.793 --> 13:50.172
and to unpack that notion
just a bit...

13:50.275 --> 13:51.827
You have to kind of unpack

13:51.931 --> 13:53.241
the term "unpack."

13:58.379 --> 14:00.655
- Hi there, Matt.

14:00.758 --> 14:01.586
Just to give you a heads up,

14:01.689 --> 14:03.689
I'm dead and in heaven.

14:03.793 --> 14:06.379
Ah, just kidding.

14:06.482 --> 14:08.586
Heaven isn't real.

14:08.689 --> 14:10.413
Anyway,
I came here to tell you

14:10.517 --> 14:12.896
you are wasting your life,

14:13.000 --> 14:15.103
but more importantly, honey,

14:15.206 --> 14:16.586
your hair is a mess.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.931
I wish you'd comb your hair.

14:19.034 --> 14:22.896
You look so much nicer
when you comb your hair.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.931
Maybe if you combed your hair,

14:25.034 --> 14:26.724
you'd be able to get laid.

14:26.827 --> 14:29.931
Don't you want
to get laid, Matt?

14:30.034 --> 14:33.448
- So that concludes
the story of how I got laid

14:33.551 --> 14:35.310
by Margaret Thatcher.

14:35.413 --> 14:37.344
Great at sex, but...

14:37.448 --> 14:39.034
terrible at politics.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.310
- Freedom is...

14:43.413 --> 14:44.482
slavery.

14:44.586 --> 14:46.137
Okay.

14:46.241 --> 14:47.793
I think we're finally starting
to make some progress here.

14:47.896 --> 14:50.034
- It's cruel to keep us
here in this room.

14:50.137 --> 14:51.724
- I gotta get out of here

14:51.827 --> 14:53.068
and call my family.

14:53.172 --> 14:55.275
Why are they keeping us
trapped in here?

14:55.379 --> 14:56.172
Why?

14:58.413 --> 15:01.965
Why are we here?

15:02.068 --> 15:03.827
Why are we pretending

15:03.931 --> 15:07.068
all this is not
a total waste of time?

15:07.172 --> 15:08.931
What are we doing
with our lives?

15:09.034 --> 15:11.896
We're alive for
a blink of an eye,

15:12.000 --> 15:15.965
and yet we spend it
working in jobs we hate

15:16.068 --> 15:18.517
to fill the pockets of
rich megalomaniacs

15:18.620 --> 15:20.586
who treat us like cattle!

15:20.689 --> 15:23.655
We're all just fucking cattle!

15:23.758 --> 15:26.034
Just eating grass and shitting

15:26.137 --> 15:28.724
and--and waiting
to be slaughtered.

15:28.827 --> 15:29.965
Fuck that.

15:30.068 --> 15:30.793
- Can we please get
some security in here?

15:30.896 --> 15:32.275
- Fucking fuck that.

15:35.551 --> 15:37.137
Quit your job...

15:37.241 --> 15:40.310
sell your home,
and live in the woods!

15:40.413 --> 15:42.344
You'll probably die because you
don't know survival skills,

15:42.448 --> 15:43.068
but who cares?

15:43.172 --> 15:44.172
You're gonna die anyway.

15:46.448 --> 15:48.206
Am I the only one
who thinks that?

15:48.310 --> 15:49.172
Am I crazy?

15:49.275 --> 15:51.517
No!

15:51.620 --> 15:53.827
I think, in fact,
I am the only sane one here.

15:53.931 --> 15:56.137
Am I wrong, or am I right?

15:56.241 --> 15:57.517
- What happened?
You could've left.

15:57.620 --> 15:59.310
You were free.
- I realized I have no idea

15:59.413 --> 16:00.965
what my parents' numbers are
without being able to

16:01.068 --> 16:02.413
look them up on my phone.

16:02.517 --> 16:03.620
Why?

16:03.724 --> 16:05.000
Why?

16:09.931 --> 16:10.896
- Okay then!

16:11.000 --> 16:12.206
I have an idea.

16:12.310 --> 16:14.068
How about we take
a little mental break

16:14.172 --> 16:16.068
and watch a funny YouTube?

16:17.655 --> 16:18.862
- I'm a little cucumber.

16:18.965 --> 16:20.862
I'm a little cucumber.

16:20.965 --> 16:22.862
I'm a little cucumber.

16:22.965 --> 16:24.517
I'm a little cucumber.

16:24.620 --> 16:25.862
I'm a little cucumber.

16:25.965 --> 16:27.034
Oh, me?
I'm a little cucumber.

16:27.137 --> 16:30.172
I'm a little cucumber.

16:30.275 --> 16:32.862
I'm a little cucumber.

16:32.965 --> 16:35.862
I'm a little cucumber!

16:38.103 --> 16:39.689
- I'm a little cucumber.
- I'm a little cucumber.

16:39.793 --> 16:42.172
- I'm a little cucumber.

16:42.275 --> 16:43.034
I'm a cucumber.

16:43.137 --> 16:44.275
- I'm a little cucumber.

16:44.379 --> 16:47.172
- How long have we been watching
YouTube videos?

16:47.275 --> 16:48.241
- A lifetime.
- I'm a little cucumber.

16:48.344 --> 16:50.896
- I think I'm having
an anxiety attack.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.862
- Try taking a deep breath.

16:52.965 --> 16:54.689
I still feel the same.

16:54.793 --> 16:57.379
- Oh, well, I guess that's just
what your life is now.

16:57.482 --> 16:58.448
- Oh, my God.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.413
What if I did go on
that ayahuasca trip

17:00.517 --> 17:03.448
and this is how it's
manifesting itself in my mind?

17:03.551 --> 17:05.137
- I'm a little cucumber,
I'm a little cucumber,

17:05.241 --> 17:07.655
I'm a little cucumber.
Ho-ho-ho!

17:07.758 --> 17:09.689
- Is this even real?
- I'm a little cucumber.

17:09.793 --> 17:12.551
- Are you even real?

17:12.655 --> 17:15.206
- I'm a little cucumber.

17:15.310 --> 17:16.689
Hey, it's me, Little Cucumber.

17:16.793 --> 17:17.793
Thank you so much for watching.

17:17.896 --> 17:19.793
Don't forget to subscribe!

17:19.896 --> 17:22.172
- That's it?

17:22.275 --> 17:24.827
What the fuck was that?

17:24.931 --> 17:27.344
Who suggested that video?

17:27.448 --> 17:29.517
Mary!

17:29.620 --> 17:31.689
What was supposed to be
funny about that?

17:31.793 --> 17:34.275
Can you explain to me
what was funny about that video?

17:34.379 --> 17:35.793
- Ooh! I have one more
we have to watch.

17:35.896 --> 17:36.965
- No, John!

17:37.068 --> 17:38.482
No more YouTube videos.

17:38.586 --> 17:39.620
- I was trying
to give us a break.

17:39.724 --> 17:41.241
- We don't need a break.

17:41.344 --> 17:43.103
We need to get back to work
before Christian gets here.

17:43.206 --> 17:44.931
- That's what I've been saying
this entire time.

17:45.034 --> 17:45.896
Right, Bill?
Oh.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.793
- This is incredible.

17:47.896 --> 17:49.103
Okay, John,
with all due respect,

17:49.206 --> 17:50.724
you have zero
leadership abilities.

17:50.827 --> 17:52.965
- Oh, is that right?
Here it comes.

17:53.068 --> 17:54.206
I have no leadership abilities?
- Yeah.

17:54.310 --> 17:56.931
- You were put in charge of
this meeting, too, Kate,

17:57.034 --> 17:58.241
and look where we're at.

17:58.344 --> 17:59.931
The word "racism" is
written on the board twice!

18:00.034 --> 18:01.724
- That's right, I was put
in charge and you stepped over.

18:01.827 --> 18:04.551
- Did I step over, or was it
more like a step up to the plate

18:04.655 --> 18:06.586
to lead a dominating meeting?
- You stepped on that plate,

18:06.689 --> 18:08.206
and you crushed it.
- Did I crush the plate, or was

18:08.310 --> 18:09.862
the plate meant to be crushed?
- You smashed it.

18:10.965 --> 18:13.000
- What the?

18:13.103 --> 18:14.068
- I did it.

18:14.172 --> 18:15.275
- Jesus Christ, Baron.

18:15.379 --> 18:17.172
- Go home and take care
of yourself.

18:19.862 --> 18:21.620
- It's okay, it's okay.

18:21.724 --> 18:24.000
Adele...

18:24.103 --> 18:26.000
Come on, guys, let's...

18:26.103 --> 18:27.413
- Genius.

18:27.517 --> 18:28.551
- Let's get
back to work, please.

18:28.655 --> 18:31.379
Where's the marker?

18:31.482 --> 18:33.965
- Who has the marker?
- Who stole the marker?

18:34.068 --> 18:35.413
- Guys, this isn't funny.

18:35.517 --> 18:37.379
- Morgan,
did you take the marker?

18:37.482 --> 18:39.413
- Morgan,
why is your hand in your pocket?

18:39.517 --> 18:43.724
both: Morgan, take your hand
out of your pocket right now!

18:45.517 --> 18:46.965
- Oh, my God.
It's a bird.

18:48.206 --> 18:49.206
Hi, bird.

18:50.275 --> 18:51.620
How did it get in here?

18:51.724 --> 18:53.586
- It must have flown in
when Baron left.

18:53.689 --> 18:55.103
Should we do something?
- Maybe it's hungry.

18:55.206 --> 18:58.241
- No, it's okay.
It knows what to do.

18:58.344 --> 19:01.000
It got in here, it can
get back out if it wants.

19:01.103 --> 19:02.586
- It's amazing.

19:02.689 --> 19:03.896
I feel like we're experiencing
something really special.

19:06.965 --> 19:07.896
What?

19:08.000 --> 19:08.862
- Got him.

19:12.931 --> 19:14.034
- That bird is so lucky.

19:14.137 --> 19:15.206
It only had to be in
this meeting for a minute,

19:15.310 --> 19:16.137
and then it got to die.

19:16.241 --> 19:19.655
- Grandma Dorothy loved birds.

19:19.758 --> 19:20.793
Oh, wait, no, she didn't.
That was my other grandma.

19:20.896 --> 19:22.931
Grandma Dorothy hated birds.

19:24.206 --> 19:25.896
God, I wish she was here
to see this.

19:27.862 --> 19:30.000
- Ever since that bird died
one minute ago...

19:30.103 --> 19:30.862
- Hm.
- I started thinking about

19:30.965 --> 19:33.379
my own mortality,

19:33.482 --> 19:34.724
and...

19:34.827 --> 19:37.206
I'm just really sorry that
I acted the way I did.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.724
- Why not we just
do what we do best:

19:38.827 --> 19:41.206
suppress our emotions

19:41.310 --> 19:43.517
and pretend like
this never happened?

19:47.620 --> 19:49.551
- Sorry I was out for so long.

19:49.655 --> 19:51.482
Bill...

19:53.103 --> 19:53.827
I didn't expect you
to stay this late.

19:53.931 --> 19:55.689
How're you holding up?

19:55.793 --> 19:58.034
- I killed a big bug.

19:58.137 --> 19:59.586
- Excellent work, Bill.
- Thank you.

19:59.689 --> 20:01.689
- So!

20:01.793 --> 20:04.137
Let's see what you guys
came up with.

20:04.241 --> 20:05.344
Ah...

20:05.448 --> 20:06.551
a lot of ideas here.

20:06.655 --> 20:07.551
Uh...

20:07.655 --> 20:08.551
huh...

20:11.758 --> 20:13.275
You know,
I don't like any of them.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.793
We'll pick up tomorrow
where we left off.

20:15.896 --> 20:17.206
Bill, let's go to dinner.

20:17.310 --> 20:18.137
- Yeah, I could eat dinner.

20:18.241 --> 20:19.965
Then after, I know a place

20:20.068 --> 20:21.827
that gives
great groin massages.

20:21.931 --> 20:23.827
It's called a public library.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.827
- Anyway, here we go!

20:25.931 --> 20:27.172
- So...

20:27.275 --> 20:29.000
I guess everyone can have
their phones back now.

20:35.172 --> 20:36.551
- So let me get this straight,
Grandma Dorothy.

20:36.655 --> 20:38.241
You wanted me to watch
a funny YouTube video,

20:38.344 --> 20:41.275
so you told my mom and dad
to call me?

20:41.379 --> 20:42.724
Why didn't you just send them
the link?

20:44.413 --> 20:46.586
You were gonna have them spell
it out on the phone to me?

20:47.655 --> 20:49.275
What's the video?

20:49.379 --> 20:51.482
I've already seen
"I'm a little cucumber."

20:52.965 --> 20:54.827
No, I don't know if the woman
in the video is single.

20:56.793 --> 20:57.655
No, I'm not going to
ask her out on a date.

20:59.896 --> 21:01.448
It's none of your business
how much I'm getting laid.

21:01.551 --> 21:02.310
How much are you getting laid?

21:02.413 --> 21:03.827
That's my question.

21:04.931 --> 21:05.862
Well, then, don't ask me!

21:10.827 --> 21:12.413
- And you guys know
I'm a language guy.

21:12.517 --> 21:14.137
And a math guy.
Um...

21:14.241 --> 21:16.482
I don't know--I know that--

21:16.586 --> 21:17.620
Kate knows that I went to Yale.

21:17.724 --> 21:21.241
Uh, and I know Larry knows
I went to Yale.

21:21.344 --> 21:23.103
Bill, uh, I don't know if
I've told you this,

21:23.206 --> 21:24.551
but I actually went to Yale.
