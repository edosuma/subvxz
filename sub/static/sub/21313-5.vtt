00:51.300 --> 00:53.416
--Everyone on the floor!

00:53.510 --> 00:55.046
--Get on the ground.

00:55.130 --> 00:57.291
--Come on!

00:58.510 --> 01:00.751
- Get your asses down!

01:00.850 --> 01:03.592
Get your ass on the ground. On the ground.
Get on the ground. Hey! Hey!

01:04.390 --> 01:06.438
--Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

01:06.520 --> 01:07.839
Ah, fuck! Fuck!

01:07.940 --> 01:09.976
Ah, man, why'd you make me do that?

01:10.610 --> 01:13.431
- Get your asses down! Stay down!

01:14.070 --> 01:16.607
- Shit!

01:17.200 --> 01:19.020
Stay down. Stay down. Stay down!

01:20.580 --> 01:22.150
Keep your asses down!

01:22.240 --> 01:24.071
- Bullshit! _
- I swear. I promise!

01:24.160 --> 01:25.991
-They don't give me--
-Give me the goddamn money.

01:26.410 --> 01:27.240
Come on!

01:27.330 --> 01:30.959
There's only 50 here.
Just please take it and just leave.

01:31.040 --> 01:32.792
Don't hurt me!

01:32.880 --> 01:34.120
Whoa, whoa, wait. Whoa, whoa.

01:34.210 --> 01:35.837
Take another step,
I shoot her in the face.

01:36.590 --> 01:37.750
No, no, no, no, no.

01:37.840 --> 01:40.252
This isn't ending the way
you thought it would.

01:41.220 --> 01:43.632
Stay the fuck back.

01:43.720 --> 01:44.960
-You understand?
-Yeah, yeah.

01:45.060 --> 01:47.381
-I'm not fucking around with you, man.
-I got it.

01:47.480 --> 01:50.108
-Stay back.
-This whole thing...

01:50.480 --> 01:52.641
went south when you pulled the trigger.

01:52.730 --> 01:56.063
Wallets, cash, jewelry, all of it!
Now! Come on! Let's go.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.277
Stay on the ground, man.
Stay on the ground. Man, back!

01:58.360 --> 02:01.614
Just because you made a mistake
doesn't mean you can't turn this around.

02:01.700 --> 02:03.611
No, no, no, no.
Hey, wait, wait, look at him.

02:03.700 --> 02:05.031
See, he's gonna make it.

02:05.120 --> 02:10.456
Right now, you've got a second chance...
down the road. But if you commit murder...

02:12.380 --> 02:13.495
you're gonna go away forever.

02:14.710 --> 02:17.588
- I'm not fucking playing.
- I know you're not.

02:17.670 --> 02:22.209
And I know you got this rage inside
of you that you gotta... put somewhere.

02:26.430 --> 02:28.091
Just put it right here instead.

02:29.480 --> 02:31.220
You're a fucking psycho, you know that?

02:32.020 --> 02:33.976
- Hey. Fuck. Fuck!
- Hey, hey, hey. Calm down.

02:34.070 --> 02:35.640
Calm down. Look at me. Look at me!

03:31.960 --> 03:33.245
Mason!

03:36.460 --> 03:38.371
Ash is here to help with the boat.

03:39.590 --> 03:41.217
I'll be in in a second.

05:25.820 --> 05:27.481
How do you know that's Bobby Dean?

05:28.070 --> 05:31.153
Because I've sat with him.
Pretty sure that's Bobby Dean.

05:31.450 --> 05:33.577
Well, what distinguishing feature
are you seeing here?

05:33.660 --> 05:35.742
-Please don't argue with me.
-What? What, his eyes?

05:35.830 --> 05:37.491
Look like they've been sucked out by fish.

05:37.580 --> 05:39.457
How about his fucking
blue knockoff Gucci shirt?

05:40.840 --> 05:42.410
Somebody left him here on purpose.

05:45.130 --> 05:48.008
-We have to call the cops.
-No, we're not doing that. Forget it.

05:48.090 --> 05:50.843
-There is a body at our dock.
-Yeah.

05:50.930 --> 05:54.013
It's the body of the man whose business
I just took over. Think about it.

05:55.850 --> 05:56.726
Okay.

05:56.810 --> 05:58.516
Why don't we just go inside?

05:58.600 --> 06:01.057
We could just pretend we didn't see it,
and we...

06:01.150 --> 06:02.640
- Stop poking him.
- No, we push him.

06:02.730 --> 06:05.028
- Wendy!
- Are you guys okay there?

06:07.780 --> 06:08.690
Yeah!

06:11.740 --> 06:12.820
Nice work.

06:13.740 --> 06:17.653
Waving your big fluorescent oar around,
attracting a bunch of attention.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.411
- Got that?
- Got 'em right here.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.212
Well, you can't possibly think
I'm dumb enough to kill someone

06:29.300 --> 06:31.086
and put the body at the end of my dock.

06:31.640 --> 06:33.847
Well, trust me when I tell you,
I've seen dumber.

06:33.930 --> 06:36.342
My dealings with Bobby Dean were amicable.

06:36.430 --> 06:39.092
I offered him an above-market price
for a failing business.

06:40.940 --> 06:43.010
Well, this place has a history
of chewing up men

06:43.110 --> 06:45.101
who come in here thinking
they're smarter than us.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.736
Far more formidable men than you.

06:49.780 --> 06:52.738
I expect to see that bill of sale
on my desk first thing tomorrow.

07:26.690 --> 07:28.146
Everything all right?

07:29.070 --> 07:31.607
Thought I'd introduce myself.

07:31.700 --> 07:32.940
Jacob Snell.

07:33.030 --> 07:34.816
Hi, there. Martin Byrde.

07:35.870 --> 07:39.328
I've come to understand that
you're the new owner of Llckety Splitz.

07:40.250 --> 07:42.115
-Oh, yeah.
-Congratulations.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.280
Thank you.

07:45.210 --> 07:47.451
Not sure if you're aware, but...

07:47.550 --> 07:50.713
previous owner and I,
we had a business arrangement.

07:50.800 --> 07:52.836
Benefited us both greatly.

07:54.510 --> 07:56.466
The folk who thrive around here

07:56.550 --> 07:59.599
make a point of easing
their neighbor's burden.

07:59.680 --> 08:00.977
Is that right?

08:01.060 --> 08:05.224
I figured you'd wanna continue
with this local tradition.

08:07.900 --> 08:11.438
Unfortunately, I don't think
that my employer would allow it.

08:12.280 --> 08:14.100
You haven't heard my terms yet.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.690
Business is business.

08:23.540 --> 08:24.529
Yeah.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.280
Good talking to you.

08:29.210 --> 08:30.586
You too, sir.

08:51.230 --> 08:53.437
--Thanks.

08:56.860 --> 08:57.815
I got it.

09:00.990 --> 09:03.322
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

09:07.460 --> 09:08.575
Let me help.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.830
That's okay, Vineyard Vines.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.706
You're really not supposed
to be back here.

09:13.460 --> 09:15.678
Okay. Just trying to be chivalrous.

09:15.760 --> 09:18.797
-Ah, chivalry's dead. Haven't you heard?
-Uh-huh.

09:21.350 --> 09:23.056
-Hey. Change this for me?
-Yeah?

09:23.140 --> 09:24.346
Uh, okay.

09:30.480 --> 09:31.765
You from Chicago?

09:32.320 --> 09:33.810
Uh, yeah.

09:33.900 --> 09:35.731
-Highland Park.
-Naperville.

09:36.570 --> 09:39.778
- Ah, the Naper-thrill. Nice.

09:39.870 --> 09:41.076
I'm Zach.

09:42.030 --> 09:43.156
Charlotte.

09:45.580 --> 09:46.706
Okay.

09:48.370 --> 09:52.158
You gotta...
See, here, that goes in there...

09:56.630 --> 09:58.336
So you live here? Now?

09:58.430 --> 10:00.591
Uh, only for the summer.

10:00.680 --> 10:01.669
Hmm.

10:02.600 --> 10:05.888
So is there any chance
I can get you to the party cove?

10:05.980 --> 10:08.380
--Gets pretty wild on a holiday weekend.

10:09.850 --> 10:12.307
Uh, I wish,
but I'll be chained to that dock.

10:14.190 --> 10:16.146
- I see. Thanks.

10:17.740 --> 10:19.025
How much do I owe you?

10:19.740 --> 10:22.368
Uh, you know,
I'm not usually back here, so...

10:23.490 --> 10:24.479
I have no idea.

10:25.160 --> 10:27.651
Well... keep the change.

10:30.120 --> 10:31.826
Hope to see you around.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.000
All right, we're good to go.

10:41.720 --> 10:44.462
- Party cove, here we come!

10:49.810 --> 10:51.266
Yeah, I'm over here!

11:00.280 --> 11:01.440
Hey, there you are. Um...

11:01.530 --> 11:03.612
do you have any idea
why everyone's staring at me out there?

11:03.700 --> 11:05.406
They think you killed him.

11:06.450 --> 11:08.247
-They think I killed Bobby Dean.
-Mm-hmm.

11:08.330 --> 11:10.400
Great. That's great.

11:10.500 --> 11:14.709
Yep. FirstI heard it from Fats
when I got my smokes.

11:14.790 --> 11:17.497
-Who's Fats? _
-You know, the guy from the liquor store.

11:17.590 --> 11:20.627
-No.
-And then Mary mentioned it at breakfast.

11:20.720 --> 11:23.427
-Mary?
-You know, the waitress with the teeth.

11:23.510 --> 11:26.092
Okay. This whole town's like
a big fuckin' game of telephone.

11:26.180 --> 11:27.886
Yeah, except Mary said that...

11:28.310 --> 11:31.347
they just saw Bobby Dean's head
floating in the water,

11:31.440 --> 11:33.396
just bobbing all like...

11:33.770 --> 11:35.931
Mm-hmm. Well, what'd you tell them?

11:36.860 --> 11:40.819
I told them Bobby Dean didn't have
a nice body anyway. Man tits.

11:41.360 --> 11:43.191
Okay. Well, obviously,
I didn't kill anyone.

11:43.780 --> 11:46.078
I know. If you're a killer,
then I'm fucking Snow White.

11:46.160 --> 11:48.151
-And I don't see any dwarfs around.
-Right.

11:48.240 --> 11:50.572
So, listen, Ruth, um, I need you to, um,

11:50.660 --> 11:52.457
take care of things around here
for a little while.

11:52.540 --> 11:54.667
Can you do that? Run stuff?

11:54.750 --> 11:55.739
-Me?
-Yeah.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.377
Just through the holiday weekend.
I gotta work at the Blue Cat.

11:58.460 --> 12:00.667
Well, it'll be fucking slammed here.

12:01.260 --> 12:03.216
I'll make it worth your while,
cash-wise, I promise.

12:03.300 --> 12:05.291
You got any questions,
just give me a call. Okay?

12:05.930 --> 12:06.919
You'll be fine.

12:26.950 --> 12:30.693
Who... who the hell said you could
come in here without my permission?

12:31.870 --> 12:36.159
Did your pinko parents not teach you
the meaning of private property?

12:38.290 --> 12:39.291
Huh?

12:43.090 --> 12:46.253
-Is the lake a dangerous place?
-Is what?

12:46.800 --> 12:48.176
Is the lake dangerous?

12:49.850 --> 12:52.091
This about the body they found?

12:56.230 --> 13:00.724
Well, dangerous is not the first word
that comes to mind.

13:00.820 --> 13:05.564
Although, I've seen my share of
bare bodies bloated beyond recognition...

13:06.660 --> 13:10.983
tourists turned to Swiss cheese
by propeller blades...

13:12.620 --> 13:15.157
They usually ascribe it to ignorance.

13:17.000 --> 13:21.448
But... I guess you can't discount the...

13:22.670 --> 13:26.959
possibility of something more sinister
at work.

13:29.470 --> 13:31.426
Is that why you have all these guns?

13:33.140 --> 13:36.689
If that's what you wanna say.

13:40.230 --> 13:42.437
My parents don't really like guns.

13:47.070 --> 13:50.813
Why the hell did they move here
if they don't like guns?

13:55.660 --> 13:58.572
You know, a kid can't pass
middle school health class

13:58.670 --> 14:00.740
until he had his hunter's safety badge.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.586
It was for work.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.250
What kinda work?

14:09.890 --> 14:12.211
My dad brings businesses back to life.

14:14.140 --> 14:17.974
Well, wasn't the swamp thing on the dock
in business with your dad?

14:19.190 --> 14:22.398
If so, looks like
a mighty dangerous place to be.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.065
No.

14:30.740 --> 14:32.059
I don't know.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.578
Well, I've been here nearly 30-odd years.

14:35.660 --> 14:39.448
And in that time, every son of a bitch
I've seen move here

14:39.540 --> 14:42.373
was running from something unsavory.

14:46.260 --> 14:47.750
What were you running from?

14:50.430 --> 14:51.966
You moved here, right?

14:54.600 --> 14:55.806
What did you do?

15:00.850 --> 15:03.432
Now, hold it still.
You let the barrel slip

15:03.520 --> 15:06.432
'cause you weren't staring
through the shot.

15:06.530 --> 15:11.979
You gotta keep aiming at the target
even after the smoke clears.

15:20.210 --> 15:21.609
Yes!

15:21.710 --> 15:24.417
Now that's what I love about watermelon.

15:24.500 --> 15:25.489
- They...

15:25.590 --> 15:28.457
...approximate the water content
of a human body.

15:33.050 --> 15:36.599
Not that I advocate that,
but...

15:41.390 --> 15:43.688
Did you know a sacrifice fly

15:43.770 --> 15:47.809
doesn't affect batting average,
but lowers OBP?

15:47.900 --> 15:52.189
So, at bat did happen,
but didn't happen at the same time.

15:52.950 --> 15:55.111
Jesus, Tuck.
How do you remember all that stuff?

15:55.200 --> 15:57.361
I don't know. I just do.

15:57.450 --> 15:59.156
Here, throw this out for me?

15:59.540 --> 16:02.612
-Whoa! Easy, Pacquiao.
-I just wanted to say sorry.

16:02.710 --> 16:06.032
-All good. It's just about healed.
-No, for my freak show of a mother.

16:06.130 --> 16:09.702
And the punch you deserved,
but a dead animal's just disgusting.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.506
Well, uh, apology accepted.

16:11.590 --> 16:14.798
Uh... And, I'm... I'm really sorry

16:14.890 --> 16:16.881
-about all that stuff, too.
-Well...

16:19.770 --> 16:23.388
Should've_known I wouldn't
come at you With my right. Not again.

16:23.980 --> 16:25.186
Why? Is it, like,

16:25.270 --> 16:27.727
good manners to put the second black eye
on the other side?

16:28.940 --> 16:31.647
Uh, I don't know about manners,
but symmetry is more attractive.

16:34.530 --> 16:35.406
See ya.

16:39.620 --> 16:41.497
You know that _
Bobby Dean had enemies?

16:41.580 --> 16:43.707
Most assholes do.

16:43.790 --> 16:46.167
People that would pin a murder on someone?

16:47.330 --> 16:49.798
You mean the someone
that stole hIs strip club?

16:49.880 --> 16:53.168
Oh, please. I paid a fair price.
A lot more than I needed to.

16:54.180 --> 16:58.048
Okay, I am starting to get
the feeling that there is more to you

16:58.140 --> 17:00.882
than meets the eye,
at least more than good hair.

17:00.970 --> 17:02.631
And I'm not sure how I feel about it.

17:02.720 --> 17:04.631
Mm. I'm a businessman, Rachel. That's it.

17:04.730 --> 17:07.597
Yeah, look. I have no idea
what Bobby Dean was into, okay?

17:07.690 --> 17:10.181
I avoided him like the clap
when he was alive

17:10.270 --> 17:12.898
and I don't see why
that should change now that he is dead.

17:12.980 --> 17:14.106
But here's what I do know.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.987
You, being here,
being visible to customers...

17:18.280 --> 17:20.521
I'm not sure that's good
for business right now.

17:21.120 --> 17:22.439
You should stay away.

17:23.200 --> 17:24.201
Oh, yeah?

17:24.290 --> 17:28.408
At least, you know, camp out in the office
or something till this gets sorted out.

17:28.500 --> 17:32.584
Yeah, fine.
Although, let me ask you a question.

17:32.670 --> 17:35.218
Uh, what do you know about the name...

17:35.880 --> 17:37.120
Snell?

17:40.050 --> 17:41.096
Well...

17:46.730 --> 17:49.267
they've lived here
as long as anyone can remember.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.851
Moved up into those hills
when the dam was built.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.686
Lake swallowed up their ancestors' graves.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.857
Folks tell all kinds of tales
about the devious things

17:58.950 --> 18:02.613
that are going on on that farm,
but who knows what is just urban legend.

18:04.330 --> 18:07.072
How'd Bobby look
when they fished him out?

18:07.160 --> 18:08.787
Like a peeled pumpkin.

18:08.870 --> 18:12.203
Mm.
Let that be a lesson to you, Ash.

18:12.840 --> 18:17.129
Never trust a redneck _
when you need the job done rIght.

18:17.720 --> 18:20.086
- Yes, ma'am.
- And this Byrde man...

18:20.180 --> 18:21.545
Martin Byrde.

18:22.180 --> 18:24.762
Said his employer wouldn't allow it.

18:24.850 --> 18:26.477
His exact words.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.596
Even after he saw the body?

18:30.060 --> 18:33.143
I watched Sheriff Nix fish it out
right in front of him.

18:34.070 --> 18:38.279
All of which means he's more afraid
of his boss than he is of us.

18:38.360 --> 18:41.488
Only question is,
does he have reason to be?

18:41.570 --> 18:43.868
--Ash!

18:45.910 --> 18:50.916
Now, you know what you need to do
for us now, don't you?

18:51.420 --> 18:52.739
About Mr. Byrde.

18:53.210 --> 18:54.199
Yes, ma'am.

18:54.590 --> 18:57.206
-Best get to it, then.
-Yes, ma'am.

19:02.930 --> 19:04.591
Another nest?

19:05.350 --> 19:06.556
Mm-hmm.

19:07.430 --> 19:10.979
Every one we've found so far
has been up in the hills.

19:12.900 --> 19:14.811
Way above the waterline.

19:15.610 --> 19:19.319
--We must be due one hell of a storm.

19:20.070 --> 19:22.197
It'll start before sunset.

19:22.990 --> 19:25.231
Guess we won't have to water the crop.

20:21.670 --> 20:25.629
This is Josh Silverberg.
I believe you knew his father Gary?

20:26.220 --> 20:29.712
Josh has some questions
about his father's suicide.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.261
Nice to meet you, Josh.

20:36.770 --> 20:38.317
Leave you two to talk.

20:44.150 --> 20:46.527
--I am so sorry about your father.

20:46.620 --> 20:49.407
It was pretty easy for me
to ﬁnd you, actually.

20:50.540 --> 20:53.782
You were all over
my father's Facebook page.

20:57.130 --> 20:58.165
What kind of questions?

20:58.250 --> 21:01.128
Why'd you hang up on me
when I called you from my father's phone?

21:02.050 --> 21:05.258
-Seems like a pretty good place to start.
-I don't know.

21:07.720 --> 21:09.290
I guess I was surprised.

21:10.390 --> 21:12.460
Yeah, I've been calling the detective...

21:13.020 --> 21:15.682
who's been working
on my father's case every day,

21:15.770 --> 21:19.103
telling him that there's no way
my father could've killed himself.

21:20.270 --> 21:22.602
-What does he say?
-That I'm wrong,

21:22.690 --> 21:25.238
that I should talk to someone,
that I'm in denial.

21:25.320 --> 21:28.369
Well, it's... it's only natural,
I mean, to search for answers.

21:29.410 --> 21:30.946
When I was 16...

21:32.580 --> 21:36.619
one of my best friends ended her life,
and my friends and I, we just...

21:36.710 --> 21:40.623
-we couldn't accept that she--
-The detective is wrong. I know it.

21:44.170 --> 21:47.799
-Okay.
-He was the happiest he'd been in years.

21:48.930 --> 21:50.090
He told me so...

21:50.430 --> 21:55.049
ten days before he supposedly
threw himself out of an 80th-story window?

22:00.110 --> 22:01.975
I had just told him...

22:04.110 --> 22:05.316
that it was over.

22:05.860 --> 22:09.773
That I was leaving Chicago with my family
to give my marriage a second chance.

22:12.330 --> 22:15.242
I... I talked to my father
almost every day.

22:15.620 --> 22:17.747
How... how come I never even heard of you?

22:17.830 --> 22:18.819
I don't know.

22:19.380 --> 22:20.870
I have a family.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.740
Maybe he was trying to protect me.

22:23.840 --> 22:26.627
So you expect me to believe
that my father...

22:27.470 --> 22:29.586
loved you so much that he...

22:30.890 --> 22:34.883
-took his own life when you left?
-I'm just telling you what I know.

22:36.060 --> 22:37.220
Did you love him?

22:56.120 --> 22:59.032
--I'm gonna jump in the shower, Rach.

23:07.590 --> 23:08.750
Hi.

23:09.800 --> 23:11.586
Sorry, I forgot it was Sunday.

23:15.140 --> 23:19.019
Well, he's...
Wasn't that good if you were wondering.

23:19.690 --> 23:22.557
His ego just needed a little boost.

23:25.610 --> 23:28.682
So_we'_re screwed for the Fourth
If this doesn't let up, right?

23:29.900 --> 23:31.606
Old-timers like my grandma...

23:32.200 --> 23:35.738
she used to call these
big summer holidays the "ruling days."

23:35.830 --> 23:39.948
As in, these are the days that will rule
how we live the rest of the year. But...

23:41.670 --> 23:43.956
I'm guessing
Marty Byrde already knew that.

23:45.750 --> 23:48.457
I'm guessing he's not really here
'cause of the rain.

23:51.090 --> 23:54.924
Yeah. Things are a little, uh,
complicated at the house right now.

23:56.300 --> 23:57.210
Well...

23:58.680 --> 24:01.387
if anyone knows complicated, it's me.

24:02.310 --> 24:03.641
Hmm.

24:03.730 --> 24:06.301
Well, my wife's talking
to her dead lover's son.

24:14.240 --> 24:15.525
Thanks. What about your...

24:15.620 --> 24:17.440
-Fuck of the week?
-Yeah.

24:18.370 --> 24:20.827
Yeah, well, company's better out here.

24:24.040 --> 24:24.870
Thanks.

24:48.230 --> 24:49.606
Hey, no lap dance for you.

24:50.320 --> 24:51.810
Yeah... free money.

24:52.860 --> 24:54.316
That was good. Huh.

25:14.760 --> 25:16.170
Who the hell is that on the pole?

25:17.340 --> 25:20.389
We needed to class the joint up
if we ever wanna make any money.

25:20.470 --> 25:23.268
-And this was Marty's idea?
-Mm-mm. Mine.

25:24.350 --> 25:28.434
I looked at our inventory
and I felt that it was lacking.

25:30.440 --> 25:32.067
Don't get your thong in a bunch.

25:32.150 --> 25:34.641
Competition's good for you.
It builds character.

25:35.240 --> 25:37.105
Well, we all know why you're here.

25:38.780 --> 25:40.327
What was that you said?

25:43.120 --> 25:44.155
It's okay. Tell me.

25:44.750 --> 25:47.116
Bobby Dean turns up dead,
and now you're in charge?

25:48.670 --> 25:50.661
Don't deny it.
We all know who your daddy is.

26:03.640 --> 26:06.768
Anyone else got shit to say
about my daddy?

26:07.310 --> 26:08.345
Hmm?

26:12.110 --> 26:13.099
Then get back to work.

26:13.190 --> 26:15.772
We got a shit-ton of money
to make this weekend.

26:37.590 --> 26:39.000
Well, what does he know?

26:40.140 --> 26:41.084
Nothing.

26:42.140 --> 26:44.131
Nothing? What the hell
was the kid doing here, then?

26:44.220 --> 26:46.211
Why'd he drive all the way down
from Chicago?

26:47.140 --> 26:49.267
Because he suspects.

26:49.350 --> 26:50.931
Okay, what does he suspect?

26:51.520 --> 26:53.306
And I'll need some speciﬁcs, Wendy.

26:55.940 --> 26:58.431
He doesn't believe
his father committed suicide.

27:00.030 --> 27:01.816
And he's talking to the police.

27:12.330 --> 27:14.878
-Well, did you change his mind?
-I don't know.

27:15.420 --> 27:17.661
-Then you didn't change his mind.
-I don't know.

27:17.760 --> 27:19.716
-You would know, don't you think?
-I don't know.

27:19.800 --> 27:21.836
And what was I supposed to do?

27:21.930 --> 27:23.921
Kill him and throw him off the dock?

27:24.850 --> 27:28.763
What did you tell him? What was said?
What did you speak about?

27:31.690 --> 27:34.853
I told him his father was heartbroken
because I left.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.471
- What'd he say?

27:40.740 --> 27:42.401
Where you going? Wendy?

27:46.950 --> 27:48.906
He asked me ifI loved his dad.

27:50.790 --> 27:51.950
Oh, yeah?

27:53.460 --> 27:54.700
What did you say?

27:56.040 --> 27:57.496
That I didn't.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.621
-Was that the truth?
-Yes.

28:06.050 --> 28:07.096
Okay.

28:44.380 --> 28:45.961
Been looking for you.

28:47.220 --> 28:49.632
Checked out a couple of spots I know.

28:49.720 --> 28:51.631
Water's running real good.

28:52.520 --> 28:55.262
I thought you weren't interested
in ﬁshing with me anymore.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.891
Well, you planning on paying me
for my time?

29:00.360 --> 29:01.475
Of course.

29:02.900 --> 29:04.140
Money's money.

29:05.410 --> 29:07.446
All right. Well...

29:08.120 --> 29:09.610
just give me a call, then.

29:33.720 --> 29:35.847
Here's that bill of sale you asked for.

29:35.940 --> 29:39.728
You can see the final sale price there
and the date of transfer.

29:40.610 --> 29:44.944
Next page, you can see the certification,
the... title transaction.

29:45.030 --> 29:46.190
It's all there.

29:46.820 --> 29:48.981
- Hmm.
- Okay?

29:49.070 --> 29:52.574
I... I called the Chicago PD
earlier today.

29:52.660 --> 29:57.074
Seems your business partner
and his girlfriend disappeared

29:57.170 --> 30:00.207
just before you moved to my little
jurisdictional paradise here.

30:00.290 --> 30:01.279
Mm-hmm.

30:01.380 --> 30:02.950
You have anything to tell me about that?

30:03.960 --> 30:07.009
Got nothing to say that we haven't
already told the authorities.

30:07.720 --> 30:12.259
I'm gonna give you the simplest,
most neighborly advice I can give.

30:12.850 --> 30:15.421
Whatever it is you're up to...

30:16.810 --> 30:17.970
stop.

30:19.310 --> 30:21.358
Sheriff, we're not up to anything, okay?

30:23.900 --> 30:26.687
All right. Well...

30:27.360 --> 30:28.691
Keep the bill of sale.

30:29.200 --> 30:31.691
Bobby Dean had enough heroin in him
to kill a horse.

30:32.240 --> 30:33.650
We're calling it an overdose.

30:35.700 --> 30:36.530
Okay.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.285
Was it an overdose?

30:42.210 --> 30:45.168
Yesterday you seemed certain
it was foul play.

30:45.920 --> 30:49.504
Well, we prefer to keep all options open
at the start of an investigation.

30:50.090 --> 30:51.921
Enough heroin to kill a horse.

30:52.510 --> 30:54.466
Not even the worst addicts
have that much heroin--

30:54.560 --> 30:56.096
It was an expression.

30:58.270 --> 30:59.259
Was it?

31:02.560 --> 31:04.937
Let me... Let me make this very clear.

31:05.860 --> 31:10.149
It's_better for_all of us
if we can just call thIs an overdose.

31:11.820 --> 31:12.775
Understood.

31:14.160 --> 31:15.696
You have a good day.

31:29.510 --> 31:32.172
Holy Loretta!
I can't believe how many you just caught.

31:32.260 --> 31:34.421
You know exactly where you were taking me.

31:34.510 --> 31:37.013
Oh, hell, yeah, I've been...
I've been there a hundred times.

31:37.100 --> 31:39.011
- That's my little spot.

31:40.690 --> 31:43.648
- It's a good little... little hole.
- I will tell you this,

31:43.730 --> 31:47.109
I have never seen someone catch one,
get it off the hook,

31:47.190 --> 31:50.353
put it back in, and get another one
so fast in my life.

31:50.450 --> 31:52.315
- Well...

31:52.410 --> 31:54.981
Oh! That's what it takes...

31:56.080 --> 31:57.980
to be a professional,
you know what I'm saying?

32:00.620 --> 32:01.700
Oh!

32:04.250 --> 32:05.456
Oh, buddy.

32:06.000 --> 32:08.377
Give me some of that.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.337
Mmm. Mmm.

32:10.420 --> 32:13.002
That is the best damn day in the water
I've ever had in my life.

32:13.090 --> 32:15.388
- I know.
- Fuck!

32:15.470 --> 32:17.461
Right?

32:20.390 --> 32:21.596
Ah, shit.

32:25.060 --> 32:26.436
Hey.

32:32.450 --> 32:33.565
The fuck is wrong with you?

32:33.650 --> 32:35.231
I'm sorry. I just got carried away.

32:36.950 --> 32:39.236
- Stay away from me, you fucking fag!

32:39.330 --> 32:40.365
--Faggot!

32:40.450 --> 32:43.112
-All right. All right. All right.
-Get... get the fuck out!

32:43.210 --> 32:44.746
The fuck out of my truck!

32:44.830 --> 32:46.741
-All right. All right.
-Fuck you!

32:47.290 --> 32:48.200
He knows.

32:48.920 --> 32:50.547
He knows the Snells killed him.

32:51.420 --> 32:53.217
Fucking sheriff
and even he's afraid of them.

32:53.300 --> 32:55.382
Snells wanted us dead,
they would've done it already.

32:55.470 --> 32:58.098
So don't worry. We just...
We just avoid their turf, I think.

32:58.180 --> 33:00.762
-So what exactly is their turf?
-Well, fucking everything, right?

33:00.850 --> 33:03.808
Probably why every single business
rejected me the second we got in here.

33:03.890 --> 33:06.267
Now I got that dead body.
No one's gonna wanna work with me.

33:06.350 --> 33:08.898
We'r_e_ screwed.
We got $4 million left to launder.

33:08.980 --> 33:11.357
How are we gonna find
enough businesses to clean that much

33:11.440 --> 33:13.692
without getting into a war
with these people?

33:17.120 --> 33:18.405
Uh...

33:23.040 --> 33:25.110
We have to build something of our own.

33:25.210 --> 33:26.780
Flipping houses isn't gonna do it, Wendy.

33:26.870 --> 33:28.701
Could flip 50 houses,
it's not gonna make a dent.

33:28.790 --> 33:30.587
-Then it has to be bigger.
-Yeah? Like what?

33:30.670 --> 33:31.876
I don't know.

33:31.960 --> 33:34.087
But you can move money
through construction costs.

33:34.170 --> 33:38.459
-Yeah. It'd have to be massive.
-Yeah! Well, obviously.

33:38.550 --> 33:40.962
Think lots of people. Lots of cash.

33:41.680 --> 33:42.920
And no IRS.

33:43.810 --> 33:46.222
Okay. So... so... so what is that?

33:46.310 --> 33:47.720
-I don't know. You tell me.
_I'm__

33:47.810 --> 33:51.143
Well, there's gotta be some business
the IRS is afraid to touch.

33:58.780 --> 34:01.237
-Hello.
-Hi! We're the Byrdes. I'm Wendy.

34:01.330 --> 34:02.194
-Hi.
-Hey.

34:02.290 --> 34:03.279
-Marty. Hi.
-Mason.

34:03.370 --> 34:05.156
- Hey. Grace. Hi.
- Hi.

34:05.250 --> 34:06.490
-Thanks for having us.
-Course.

34:06.580 --> 34:08.207
We can go out to the porch here.

34:16.220 --> 34:18.711
Don't swim past that red buoy.

34:19.720 --> 34:23.258
Boats come out of nowhere,
they'll sweep you up in their wake.

34:25.600 --> 34:29.684
Take a month to_ fish out_
all your tender lIttle bIts and pieces.

34:31.940 --> 34:33.316
Not that I'd miss you...

34:34.360 --> 34:38.023
but if you cost me the last good month
of boating in my life,

34:38.110 --> 34:41.694
I promise I'll piss on your grave
every last day until I die.

34:42.660 --> 34:43.649
Yeah, well,

34:43.740 --> 34:47.153
what makes you think they'd find enough
to bury me before you drop dead?

35:05.970 --> 35:08.632
So, uh, what drew you here?

35:08.730 --> 35:10.641
Um, well, the work.

35:11.560 --> 35:14.814
Right. Probably the work, mostly.
Thank you so much.

35:14.900 --> 35:17.812
Sure. I meant... _
I meant to our congregation.

35:18.440 --> 35:20.442
- Mm.

35:20.530 --> 35:22.316
-Of course. Sorry. Um...
-It's okay.

35:23.570 --> 35:25.322
Well, belief.

35:25.410 --> 35:26.399
Hmm.

35:26.490 --> 35:29.823
Um, some of the other members. The pastor.

35:29.910 --> 35:33.494
You know, I saw you...
I saw you preach one morning

35:33.580 --> 35:34.956
just after we moved here.

35:35.040 --> 35:37.088
Yeah, I remember. I saw you driving off

35:37.170 --> 35:39.502
as if you were fleeing a leper colony.

35:39.590 --> 35:41.922
Oh. Well, I was, uh...

35:42.010 --> 35:44.080
You know, before we make a decision
on a church,

35:44.180 --> 35:46.637
we wanted to make sure
that we researched all of them.

35:47.180 --> 35:48.886
And all the gentlemen's clubs.

35:50.640 --> 35:51.880
Yeah.

35:51.980 --> 35:55.188
Okay, look, obviously
we're not the most religious people

35:55.270 --> 35:57.431
-on the planet.
-Well, she speaks for herself.

35:57.530 --> 36:00.101
I mean, the last time
we were both at a service was for my...

36:00.190 --> 36:02.909
was for my cousin Skip's wedding
in a small chapel in Las Vegas...

36:02.990 --> 36:03.979
That's right.

36:04.070 --> 36:06.152
...that lasted longer
than the actual marriage.

36:06.240 --> 36:08.868
But, look, whatever you might think
of our businesses--

36:08.950 --> 36:12.078
-I don't think anything.
-Uh, you seem like someone who...

36:13.620 --> 36:15.747
You really want to do some good
in the world.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.205
And we can help you.

36:17.300 --> 36:18.836
By building a church.

36:21.170 --> 36:22.330
Oh.

36:24.050 --> 36:26.678
Oh, I have a... I have a church.

36:27.600 --> 36:29.670
You... you have a boat.

36:29.770 --> 36:33.558
And before that, a sidewalk in St. Louis.
A church is not a building.

36:33.640 --> 36:34.846
But it can be...

36:35.980 --> 36:37.470
if you build it right.

36:38.320 --> 36:42.279
I mean, the church that
I grew up in was in Boone, North Carolina.

36:42.360 --> 36:46.615
Our preacher,
he was this 70-year-old chain smoker.

36:46.700 --> 36:51.194
He had this voice like a...
like a distinguished Foghorn Leghorn.

36:51.290 --> 36:52.325
But he...

36:52.410 --> 36:56.870
he managed to gather everybody together
and they built that church.

36:57.670 --> 37:01.709
And every Sunday, after service,
my daddy, he would take me by the hand...

37:01.800 --> 37:05.429
and he would show me
the nails that he hammered in.

37:05.510 --> 37:07.387
It meant that much to him.

37:08.390 --> 37:10.597
And once upon a time, it...

37:10.680 --> 37:12.090
...it meant that much to me.

37:13.180 --> 37:15.011
What made you stop attending?

37:18.190 --> 37:19.179
I...

37:21.860 --> 37:23.316
I don't know.

37:24.150 --> 37:29.110
Uh, I mean, I don't believe that...
people actually need a reason

37:29.200 --> 37:32.112
to do the things they do.
I mean, sometimes people just act.

37:32.200 --> 37:34.191
And then they come up
with an explanation later

37:34.290 --> 37:36.030
when they're looking back.
I mean, what...

37:36.120 --> 37:38.281
what made you say, "This is my calling"?

37:40.170 --> 37:44.914
Something happened to me.
A situation I put myself in.

37:46.260 --> 37:49.252
You know, I've never really
considered myself to be a brave person.

37:49.350 --> 37:50.465
I don't know why I did it.

37:51.510 --> 37:52.670
It made no sense.

37:54.810 --> 37:58.302
But something came over me... afterwards.

37:59.940 --> 38:02.101
I had the need to help people.

38:03.900 --> 38:05.527
Hmm.

38:05.610 --> 38:07.692
I think that's what everybody wants.

38:07.780 --> 38:09.736
I think that's what
everyone's looking for.

38:09.820 --> 38:13.119
- You know, to feel helpful.
- Mm.

38:13.200 --> 38:18.069
And not just during the summer.
And not just people who own boats.

38:18.170 --> 38:19.535
Let us help you.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.996
I mean, we just want to pay for it.

38:23.090 --> 38:26.048
But... but your congregation
should build it.

38:26.840 --> 38:28.717
Let them learn what they're capable of.

39:15.890 --> 39:19.382
-- Everything will be just fine

39:20.100 --> 39:23.399
Please wait and see, baby

39:24.400 --> 39:28.359
- I need a little time

39:28.440 --> 39:31.568
- Before we get married
-

39:32.570 --> 39:35.824
I have to go away

39:37.660 --> 39:39.821
Not because of you

39:41.370 --> 39:43.873
Come another day

39:45.460 --> 39:47.371
I'll be with you

39:47.460 --> 39:51.624
So, don't worry, Tracy

39:53.220 --> 39:56.462
How long apart

39:58.560 --> 40:00.266
I'm not a fucking fag.

40:02.270 --> 40:03.339
Okay.

40:06.230 --> 40:08.186
You know,
I don't want to have to fight you.

40:10.110 --> 40:11.236
Hey.

40:11.820 --> 40:14.948
Stop, stop. Stop! Stop!

40:25.380 --> 40:26.620
- Okay. Just...

40:28.630 --> 40:30.200
--You're drunk.

40:33.090 --> 40:34.637
- Fuck.
- And?

40:43.890 --> 40:47.053
Yeah, you're a bombshell, TNT

40:48.690 --> 40:51.238
Highly explosive
Yeah, you gotta be

40:51.320 --> 40:55.199
Like Rita Hayworth
You throw bombs at me

40:55.280 --> 40:58.158
Fire it up
Oh, one more time

40:58.240 --> 41:01.789
I free a land job
Right on the target line

41:01.870 --> 41:05.362
Radioactive, all over me

41:05.460 --> 41:08.782
She'll find the flash
Makes it so hard to see

41:08.880 --> 41:12.293
Contamination, it don't worry me...

41:13.470 --> 41:14.755
Ruling days.

41:29.150 --> 41:32.608
Okay. How long does it take you to forget
that someone threw you off a boat?

41:33.150 --> 41:35.311
I don't know. Maybe the same
amount of time it takes to forget

41:35.400 --> 41:37.812
that somebody's mother threw
a dead animal at you.

41:37.910 --> 41:39.195
It's not the same thing.

41:39.280 --> 41:42.579
Oh, is my money-laundering mother
really playing morality police here?

41:44.540 --> 41:45.746
Okay. But...

41:46.670 --> 41:48.956
- you have to cover yourself up.
- Okay.

41:49.040 --> 41:50.917
-If I text you, you text me back.
-Yes.

41:51.840 --> 41:54.047
-And you be careful.
-Always careful.

41:54.130 --> 41:56.963
-You be careful. Be very, very careful.
-Okay, goodbye.

42:25.700 --> 42:29.488
Yeah!

42:32.000 --> 42:32.955
Whoo!

42:36.010 --> 42:37.125
Whoo!

42:54.980 --> 42:56.060
-Hi.
-Hey.

42:56.990 --> 42:59.697
I wasn't sure what to do
with all this cash

42:59.780 --> 43:02.988
since the banks are closed
and there's only so much that...

43:03.910 --> 43:06.697
-we can deposit through the slot.
-Yeah? How much we talking?

43:07.790 --> 43:09.155
Eighty grand.

43:11.080 --> 43:12.741
Very nice. You hired new dancers.

43:12.840 --> 43:16.128
Yeah. I figured we can use 'em
over the weekend,

43:16.210 --> 43:19.998
but... we might as well keep them.
They're a big hit with the boys.

43:20.090 --> 43:21.580
Well, that is your call.

43:22.720 --> 43:26.269
-What do you mean?
-I mean it's yours, if you want it.

43:27.390 --> 43:28.846
-The club?
-Yeah.

43:28.930 --> 43:31.228
I'll run the books,
you can take care of the day-to-day.

43:31.310 --> 43:32.891
I'll give you 1,000 bucks a week.

43:35.150 --> 43:36.856
Or I can start interviewing managers.

43:36.940 --> 43:39.238
Uh, no, no, I'll... I'll do it.

43:39.900 --> 43:42.027
Good. I'll take care of this.

43:42.110 --> 43:43.156
You keep it up.

43:48.330 --> 43:50.116
So you just broke into his house?

43:50.210 --> 43:51.780
- Yup.

43:51.870 --> 43:53.451
Ever heard of a library card?

43:53.540 --> 43:55.030
You don't understand. This guy...

43:55.130 --> 43:57.758
has got first editions
like you would not believe.

43:57.840 --> 43:59.626
I doubt he even notices
anything's missmg.

43:59.720 --> 44:03.212
Look... first edition.
I read that when I was, like, 12.

44:03.300 --> 44:06.383
Mm. Yeah, science fiction's
not really my thing.

44:06.470 --> 44:09.098
Says everyone
who's never read real sci-fi.

44:09.850 --> 44:11.556
It's about humans, right?

44:12.980 --> 44:14.686
So in this, it's like we're the Martians.

44:14.770 --> 44:17.819
We're the aliens. We go to Mars...
take the place over,

44:17.900 --> 44:20.232
wipe out all the Martians and, like,
try to make it our own.

44:21.240 --> 44:25.358
_ But then we realize... _
It can never really be ours, like...

44:25.450 --> 44:28.988
even the people that were born there,
never known any other place,

44:29.080 --> 44:30.490
they'll still always be aliens.

44:30.580 --> 44:33.993
And the best part is, like,
all these people move to Mars,

44:34.080 --> 44:37.163
try to escape their problems on Earth,
and they get there and...

44:37.500 --> 44:39.206
it's like life _on Mars
isn't any different.

44:39.300 --> 44:41.837
Like, they just bring
all their old problems with them.

44:45.640 --> 44:48.632
-What the fuck is wrong with you?
-What the fuck's wrong with you?

44:48.720 --> 44:50.927
You're here, you're playing.
You know the rules.

44:52.600 --> 44:54.056
--Oh!

44:54.140 --> 44:54.970
Come here.

44:55.480 --> 44:57.471
-Damn. Damn!
-Oh, don't be a pussy.

44:58.650 --> 45:02.984
-Oh, what the fuck, Wyatt?
-What the fuck to you!

45:03.570 --> 45:05.811
Why am I the only one
who acts like an adult around here?

45:05.910 --> 45:07.866
I'm 17. You're, like, fucking 40.

45:07.950 --> 45:08.905
So?

45:09.580 --> 45:12.367
- So... fuck you!

45:13.870 --> 45:15.701
Sure you don't wanna
go get lost or something?

45:17.920 --> 45:21.583
Um, I don't know.
But I would like to use the bathroom.

45:23.340 --> 45:26.503
Um, yeah. There's a really nice one
up the road I want to show you.

45:26.590 --> 45:28.421
There something wrong with yours?

45:28.510 --> 45:31.422
-No, it's just... guys.
-Yeah.

45:32.390 --> 45:33.596
It's fine.

45:33.680 --> 45:36.057
Just, uh... Just don't mind the mess.

45:45.700 --> 45:48.112
Uh, bathroom's down the hall, to the left.

45:48.740 --> 45:49.866
Thanks.

49:16.910 --> 49:20.038
You tell anybody about this,
I'll fucking kill you.

49:22.620 --> 49:25.362
You really need to work
on your pillow talk.

50:04.870 --> 50:07.919
I wanna increase our output
to three kilos a week.

50:09.330 --> 50:11.992
Any reason why we can't dry
that much product?

50:12.090 --> 50:13.125
No, sir.

50:15.090 --> 50:17.923
And this preacher,
he still got no clue about this?

50:18.010 --> 50:19.136
Nope.

50:19.510 --> 50:21.046
-His wife?
-No, Sir.

50:22.350 --> 50:23.305
Keep it that way.

50:23.390 --> 50:26.632
I hear the rolling thunder

50:26.730 --> 50:28.015
Mason!

50:28.600 --> 50:31.683
- Thy power throughout
-Ash is here to help with the boat.

50:31.770 --> 50:36.184
- The universe displayed...
- Be there in a sec.

50:37.360 --> 50:39.351
As long as we distribute on the water...

50:40.030 --> 50:41.691
the cops can't touch us.

50:44.160 --> 50:47.459
They've been trying
to tame this place 200 years,

50:47.540 --> 50:51.124
and when they couldn't,
they figured they'd try and flood us out.

50:51.380 --> 50:55.919
How great thou art

50:56.010 --> 50:59.298
Then sings my soul

50:59.380 --> 51:04.340
My savior, God, to thee

51:05.100 --> 51:09.469
How great thou art

51:09.560 --> 51:13.439
How great thou art

51:15.280 --> 51:20.149
But man cannot tame
what God wishes to be wild.

51:20.240 --> 51:25.655
...I wander and hear the birds

51:25.740 --> 51:30.609
Sing sweetly in the trees

51:30.710 --> 51:32.746
I have some wonderful news.

51:34.960 --> 51:36.120
Let's hear it.

51:36.210 --> 51:37.620
Soon, our faith community...

51:39.260 --> 51:40.750
is gonna have a home.

51:41.180 --> 51:42.465
- Yeah!
- Praise Jesus!

51:42.550 --> 51:45.963
- Yeah. A real home! On the land!

51:46.770 --> 51:49.386
A place that we can go
not just once a week,

51:49.480 --> 51:50.879
but whenever we want.

51:52.100 --> 51:56.275
In times_of celebration...
and in mourning.

51:57.110 --> 51:59.237
In times that are sacred...

51:59.320 --> 52:02.153
...and times that are mundane.

52:02.950 --> 52:03.985
Yes!

52:09.160 --> 52:12.243
And we have this bounty, thanks to...

52:13.000 --> 52:16.037
a generous, generous gift...

52:16.130 --> 52:17.495
from our friends...

52:19.260 --> 52:21.000
Marty and Wendy Byrde.

52:21.720 --> 52:23.119
Marty and Wendy Byrde, everyone.

52:26.510 --> 52:28.057
Thank you.

52:28.140 --> 52:30.847
Please stand up. Please. Please stand up.

52:33.140 --> 52:34.266
Amen.
