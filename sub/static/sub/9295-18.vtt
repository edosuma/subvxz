00:13.513 --> 00:16.474
Someone needs to take the reins
of the IRK government.

00:17.036 --> 00:19.060
Someone who believes
in the same ideals

00:19.228 --> 00:20.936
and principles as Omar Hassan

00:21.104 --> 00:23.004
and who shares his strength.

00:23.716 --> 00:25.107
If it is the will of my people,

00:25.543 --> 00:28.235
I will take my husband's place
at the peace conference.

00:28.403 --> 00:29.753
Did you find him,{\President Taylor...}

00:30.155 --> 00:31.781
the man who killed my father?

00:31.949 --> 00:33.784
Samir Mehran, yes.

00:34.243 --> 00:37.078
He was badly wounded,
but he'll live to stand trial.

00:37.583 --> 00:38.913
<i>I took care of him. </i>

00:39.081 --> 00:41.570
So there is no connection to us.
We're in the clear?

00:41.915 --> 00:42.965
<i>Maybe not. </i>

00:43.836 --> 00:45.002
There was a woman{\ there`}

00:45.170 --> 00:47.160
- <i>who might have recognized me.</i>
- <i>What woman?</i>

00:47.285 --> 00:49.241
<i>She may be CTU.
I'm not sure,</i>

00:49.633 --> 00:51.550
but I've seen her face before.

00:51.986 --> 00:52.843
Once again,

00:53.011 --> 00:54.720
Mr. Novakovich, you're giving

00:54.888 --> 00:57.409
every indication
that Russia has no interest

00:57.534 --> 00:58.950
in this peace accord.

00:59.794 --> 01:00.893
I don't understand

01:01.061 --> 01:03.062
how you can believe
that installing Hassan's wife{\widow}

01:03.230 --> 01:04.813
will alleviate our concerns

01:04.982 --> 01:07.441
about the instability
of the IRK government.

01:08.274 --> 01:10.528
I have close friends in Moscow.

01:10.696 --> 01:12.958
Do you honestly think
your relationships

01:13.083 --> 01:14.990
- can change their minds?
- Let's just say

01:15.158 --> 01:18.058
I'm going to be
able to exercise some leverage.

01:18.788 --> 01:20.538
Jack thinks that someone inside{\ of CTU}

01:20.706 --> 01:22.323
is working for the terrorists.

01:22.933 --> 01:24.083
I spoke to Hastings.

01:24.251 --> 01:25.543
He cleared me through.

01:27.735 --> 01:28.921
Stay where you are{\ and keep your hands where I can}...

01:30.591 --> 01:31.966
She{\ just} entered the parking{\ garage}.

01:36.722 --> 01:38.055
Who are you, you lying bitch?

01:39.516 --> 01:40.566
Don't move.

<i>You were on the phone
{\with her right }before she got shot.</i>

01:56.357 --> 01:57.816
What were you talking about?

01:58.428 --> 02:01.537
Samir Mehran was given a lethal
injection at the scene of his capture.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.956
<i>{\Renee}She thought she recognized
one of the EMT from her days</i>

02:04.124 --> 02:05.499
undercover with the {\Russian }mob.

02:06.204 --> 02:07.543
I've got to get back to you.

02:08.360 --> 02:09.169
{\I'm sorry.}

02:09.338 --> 02:10.628
She didn't make it.

02:46.056 --> 02:47.958
{\pos(192,235)}I'm so sorry,
but we need to move her now.

03:09.815 --> 03:11.655
{\pos(192,220)}Are you the husband of the deceased?

03:14.111 --> 03:15.913
{\pos(192,220)}We need to contact her next of kin.

03:16.038 --> 03:17.526
{\pos(192,210)}Can you help us with that?

03:18.878 --> 03:20.586
{\pos(192,210)}Do you know where her parents live?

03:23.320 --> 03:24.286
{\pos(192,220)}Are they alive?

03:30.808 --> 03:31.961
I don't know.

03:32.759 --> 03:34.672
{\pos(192,220)}Sir, are you gonna be all right?

03:53.958 --> 03:57.047
{\pos(192,220)}I don't know if these will fit.
I got them from an intern.

03:58.248 --> 03:59.248
{\pos(192,220)}Thank you.

04:50.535 --> 04:52.112
Jack, I heard about Renee.

04:52.669 --> 04:53.667
I'm so sorry.

04:54.553 --> 04:56.147
<i>What can I do to help?</i>

04:56.272 --> 04:57.463
Tell me who did this.

04:58.792 --> 05:02.032
{\pos(192,225)}You told me earlier Renee {\thought she }recognized
someone at Hassan's crime scene.

05:02.157 --> 05:03.157
{\pos(192,225)}An EMT?

05:04.846 --> 05:06.601
{\pos(192,225)}Let us deal with that.
{\We have }Everyone's {\here working }on it.

05:06.726 --> 05:08.833
{\pos(192,225)}Don't try and handle me,
Chloe, not now.

05:09.383 --> 05:10.713
{\pos(192,225)}Who did she see?

05:10.838 --> 05:14.182
{\pos(192,225)}She thought she recognized somebody
from the Russian mob... Red Square.

05:15.169 --> 05:16.919
{\pos(192,225)}- Bazhaev's group?
- Right.

05:17.044 --> 05:19.781
{\pos(192,225)}- I want to talk to him.
- Like I said, I'm already on it.

05:19.906 --> 05:22.404
{\pos(192,225)}He's in custody somewhere, Chloe.
I brought him in myself.

05:22.572 --> 05:23.608
<i>Where is he?</i>

05:24.210 --> 05:26.045
There's something
that you need to know.

05:26.170 --> 05:29.119
Division replaced Hastings...
with me.

05:29.496 --> 05:32.083
<i>That means I'm responsible
for what happens to Bazhaev.</i>

05:32.208 --> 05:33.624
<i>I know you're upset about Renee.</i>

05:34.119 --> 05:35.119
So am I.

05:36.135 --> 05:39.588
But Bazhaev's our only lead.
I need {\whoever talks to him to be}someone in complete control.

05:40.196 --> 05:42.883
- <i>I don't think that's you right now.</i>
- I won't interfere

05:43.051 --> 05:44.416
{\pos(192,220)}with your investigation.

05:44.541 --> 05:47.217
{\pos(192,220)}- You think you can stick to that?
- I give you my word.

05:49.223 --> 05:51.956
{\pos(192,225)}I'm gonna ask you one more time:
Where is he?

05:55.204 --> 05:56.480
He's in federal court{\ downtown}.

05:56.648 --> 05:58.172
<i>He's being arraigned right now.</i>

06:04.749 --> 06:06.840
Plan was for this chamber
to be full by now.

06:06.965 --> 06:08.742
Ethan, what in the world

06:08.910 --> 06:10.068
are you doing here?

06:10.382 --> 06:11.982
You should be resting.

06:12.109 --> 06:13.656
The doctor said it was my call.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.249
I'm fine.

06:17.777 --> 06:20.491
I was thinking, Madam President,
our discussion

06:20.845 --> 06:22.481
about enlisting Charles Logan.

06:22.606 --> 06:23.606
It's done.

06:24.573 --> 06:25.759
You've contacted him{\ already}?

06:25.927 --> 06:28.012
He's on his way to talk
to the {\Russian }Foreign Minister.

06:29.119 --> 06:30.264
That was fast.

06:30.662 --> 06:33.616
The Russians were about to announce
they were pulling out of the talks.

06:33.741 --> 06:35.741
I didn't see a lot of options.

06:37.734 --> 06:38.731
What's his angle?

06:41.977 --> 06:45.612
Madam President, you said
he's on his way to talk to Novakovich.

06:47.734 --> 06:50.634
How does he intend
to get the Russians to stay?

06:51.644 --> 06:54.788
I assume he uncovered something
in his business dealings

06:54.956 --> 06:55.956
with them.

06:56.284 --> 06:57.499
But you don't know what{\ it is}?

06:59.017 --> 07:00.169
Not exactly.

07:00.473 --> 07:03.005
Madam President,
he's operating in your name.

07:04.351 --> 07:05.951
Shouldn't we find out?

07:06.552 --> 07:08.052
I agreed I wouldn't.

07:09.171 --> 07:12.598
Don't ask, don't tell was the price
for Logan's cooperation.

07:25.137 --> 07:26.137
Mikhail!

07:30.029 --> 07:31.229
Mr. President.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.639
The Russian people join you

07:34.764 --> 07:36.622
in mourning President Hassan.

07:36.968 --> 07:40.301
His death was a tragedy
for all peace-loving nations.

07:40.426 --> 07:42.294
You can save your atitudes.

07:43.822 --> 07:44.880
You want the truth.

07:45.374 --> 07:47.281
Why not... for a change?

07:50.810 --> 07:51.811
Espresso.

07:55.034 --> 07:58.304
I assume
President Taylor sent you here

07:58.429 --> 08:00.991
to bring my country back
to the barining table.

08:01.657 --> 08:03.398
She is going to be disappointed.

08:05.402 --> 08:08.176
She{\President Taylor} lured the whole world here
with the promise

08:08.301 --> 08:11.865
that Hassan had united the IRK,
that there would be peace

08:12.033 --> 08:13.617
for the first time in decades.

08:14.650 --> 08:16.700
Now it is clear that was a lie.

08:17.574 --> 08:19.123
There was no unity even with Hassan,

08:19.291 --> 08:21.091
and now that he is gone...

08:21.216 --> 08:23.716
His widow Dalia can pick up
the mantle.

08:24.721 --> 08:26.155
Not in our estimation.

08:27.191 --> 08:29.383
Hassan was undone
by his own opposition.

08:29.551 --> 08:31.635
How could his widow{\ possibly}
succeed where he failed?

08:32.259 --> 08:36.097
'Cause we both know the opposition
that undid him had outside help.

08:39.198 --> 08:42.604
Nuclear threats, assassination plots
against a heavily guarded

08:42.772 --> 08:43.881
head of state.

08:44.006 --> 08:47.649
This was not some
Third World malcontents lashing out.

08:47.774 --> 08:50.362
This was a highly organized effort

08:50.712 --> 08:54.178
orchestrated by a major rival
to the United States,

08:55.097 --> 08:57.885
a rival convinced
that their best interest

08:59.443 --> 09:01.290
was to stop the peace process

09:01.458 --> 09:02.827
by killing Hassan.

09:03.145 --> 09:04.376
If you are insinuating...

09:04.544 --> 09:08.548
Insinuating, no. I'm saying
it was people inside your government,

09:09.772 --> 09:11.216
first among them you.

09:14.293 --> 09:16.174
That is an outrageous accusation.

09:16.299 --> 09:18.342
It's a fact for which I have proof.

09:20.722 --> 09:23.645
- I don't believe you.
- Well, that's your right.

09:25.073 --> 09:27.560
But I'll tell you this,
you don't want to test me.

09:29.505 --> 09:32.196
Because what I have,
I will share with President Taylor

09:32.364 --> 09:35.654
if you and I
fail to come to an understanding here.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.235
Espresso, sir.

09:46.602 --> 09:49.338
At this point President Taylor
knows nothing about any of this.

09:50.846 --> 09:52.541
I didn't see what good
could come out

09:52.666 --> 09:55.719
of inflaming the situation
between our countries further,

09:56.443 --> 09:58.593
not without talking to you first.

10:05.414 --> 10:06.521
And now I have.

10:09.285 --> 10:10.967
The president's expecting me
at the UN.

10:11.092 --> 10:12.027
I need to go.

10:13.744 --> 10:15.948
- What will you tell her?
- {\What }I'd would like to tell her

10:16.116 --> 10:17.768
{\*is that }Russia is back at the table

10:17.893 --> 10:19.952
and her peace process is on track.

10:23.367 --> 10:24.498
But if neither of us

10:24.666 --> 10:27.098
hears from you before I get there,

10:28.211 --> 10:31.911
I'm afraid what I'll have to tell her
{\*instead }is the unvarnished truth.

10:39.778 --> 10:41.598
"Sergei... Buh-zay-off."

10:41.766 --> 10:43.267
{\pos(192,230)}Bazhaev, Your Honor.

10:43.392 --> 10:44.804
{\pos(192,230)}We'd like to waive reading.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.588
I'm sure you would,
given the charges here.

10:47.713 --> 10:49.778
I can tell you right now
I'm gonna deny bail.

10:49.903 --> 10:53.192
Judge Ruffin,
Sergei Bazhaev is a businessman

10:53.317 --> 10:55.279
with deep ties to this community.

10:55.447 --> 10:56.979
He's a foreign national.

10:57.449 --> 10:59.324
That's true, Your Honor,
but he has lived

10:59.492 --> 11:01.576
in this country continuously
since 1985.

11:01.974 --> 11:03.894
His entire family lives here.

11:04.019 --> 11:04.788
In fact,

11:04.956 --> 11:07.416
several members of his family
are represented in court{\ today},

11:07.584 --> 11:09.960
his wife, daughter-in-law, grandson,

11:10.336 --> 11:12.963
for whom incidentally
he is the sole means of support.

11:13.680 --> 11:16.133
According to the charges,
he's their sole support

11:16.301 --> 11:18.080
because he killed the boy's father,

11:18.205 --> 11:20.099
not to mention the other counts:

11:20.224 --> 11:23.473
trafficking in nuclear materials,
assassination, conspiracy.

11:25.660 --> 11:27.311
Like I said, I'm going to deny bail.

11:28.285 --> 11:30.188
I'm remanding him
to Marion immediately.

11:36.155 --> 11:38.238
Your Honor, may I have
five minutes with my client{\, please}?

11:39.876 --> 11:42.451
Fine. You have five minutes.
Court will recess for 30 minutes.

11:43.961 --> 11:45.861
Clear the courtroom, please.

11:56.311 --> 11:58.462
My client would like
to have a word with you.

12:12.153 --> 12:14.519
If you touch my family,
I swear to God...

12:14.943 --> 12:17.719
You're not {\really }sitting in the right chair
to be making threats.

12:19.050 --> 12:20.650
Who shot Renee Walker?

12:21.831 --> 12:22.949
I don't know {\at name}her.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.851
She was a former FBI agent.
Approximately six years ago,

12:25.976 --> 12:27.996
she worked undercover
in your organization.

12:28.604 --> 12:31.802
Earlier today, she recognized
one of your men as Red Square.

12:31.927 --> 12:33.210
There is no Red Square.

12:33.483 --> 12:34.583
Not anymore.

12:36.046 --> 12:37.646
Let me explain myself.

12:38.192 --> 12:39.348
This agent{\ Renee Walker}...

12:41.688 --> 12:43.261
I considered her to be my family.

12:46.006 --> 12:48.198
So take a long hard look
into my eyes

12:49.349 --> 12:51.355
and realize
that I will have no problem

12:51.480 --> 12:54.525
taking out each member of yours
before they even get home today

12:54.650 --> 12:56.775
unless I get the information I want.

12:58.806 --> 13:00.206
Whoever killed her,

13:00.616 --> 13:02.257
had nothing to do with me.

13:04.559 --> 13:06.194
Enjoy your time at Marion.

13:07.679 --> 13:10.539
I'll tell your wife
and your daughter-in-law you said hello.

13:12.750 --> 13:13.458
{\Wait.}

13:14.451 --> 13:15.451
Wait!

13:25.980 --> 13:27.182
If I tell you,

13:27.814 --> 13:28.974
they'll kill my family{\ anyway}.

13:29.361 --> 13:31.290
We'll provide them
with witness protection.

13:31.686 --> 13:32.898
I give you my word.

13:41.379 --> 13:42.237
Moscow.

13:44.882 --> 13:47.909
The Russian government...
They're behind it, not me.

13:49.103 --> 13:52.253
Everything that happened today,
all of it, was them.

13:52.664 --> 13:54.875
- Who inside the government?
- I don't know.{\What do you mean,}

13:55.043 --> 13:56.821
{\you don't know? }You're talking about 100,000 people.

13:56.946 --> 13:58.795
- I need names.
- I don't know names.

13:59.540 --> 14:01.381
They never let me get close.

14:01.716 --> 14:03.799
The woman working for them
arranged everything.

14:03.924 --> 14:04.634
Who{\at woman}?

14:05.441 --> 14:07.341
The one they planted at CTU.

14:08.357 --> 14:09.639
{\Dana Walsh.}

14:11.460 --> 14:12.350
{\Sir, let's go.}

14:16.108 --> 14:17.258
You promised.

14:19.001 --> 14:20.151
{\You promised.}

14:34.390 --> 14:36.500
{\pub}Nerve-wracking, isn't it?
Waiting.

14:37.409 --> 14:38.995
I only saw Novakovich's face,{\ sir}

14:39.120 --> 14:40.879
but you definitely
had his attention.

14:45.062 --> 14:46.512
It's the president.

14:51.432 --> 14:54.477
{\Charles Logan.
Charles.
Yes, Madam President.}

14:54.602 --> 14:57.749
I just got off the phone
with the Russian foreign minister.

14:58.602 --> 14:59.523
You did?

14:59.977 --> 15:03.026
- And what did he say?
- He said that the two of you

15:03.194 --> 15:05.190
had a very interesting discussion.

15:05.613 --> 15:08.391
And that he would be coming
to the U{\nited}N{\ations} in five hours

15:08.516 --> 15:10.909
with the Russian premier
to sign the treaty

15:11.077 --> 15:12.035
<i>as scheduled.</i>

15:12.203 --> 15:14.371
<i>He also said the credit for that</i>

15:14.633 --> 15:15.783
<i>is all yours.</i>

15:17.028 --> 15:19.834
He was in the mood to be convinced,
Madam President.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.911
Mr. President, Ethan Kanin here.

15:22.358 --> 15:24.089
- So you're back on your feet.
- Yes.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.557
And I'm curious.

15:26.150 --> 15:27.175
What did you say

15:27.343 --> 15:30.774
<i>to the Russian minister to convince him
to come back to the peace talks?</i>

15:30.899 --> 15:33.682
I told him that peace
is in all of our interests.

15:35.640 --> 15:36.476
Seriously,

15:37.030 --> 15:38.943
<i>I'd like to know how you did it.</i>

15:39.584 --> 15:42.825
Madam President,
those details are for me alone.

15:42.950 --> 15:44.192
That was our agreement.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.410
Am I right?

15:46.017 --> 15:47.167
Yes, you are.

15:47.622 --> 15:48.722
So, Ethan...

15:50.237 --> 15:51.645
let's not do anything...

15:51.770 --> 15:53.862
to sully our victory.

15:54.835 --> 15:56.121
And it is a victory.

15:56.841 --> 15:58.041
<i>For all of us.</i>

15:59.797 --> 16:01.511
<i>It's a good feeling, isn't it?</i>

16:01.857 --> 16:02.586
What?

16:03.123 --> 16:04.623
Being of service....

16:05.013 --> 16:06.313
To your country.

16:09.090 --> 16:10.010
Yes, it is.

16:11.791 --> 16:13.665
<i>I'll see you at the UN shortly.</i>

16:18.662 --> 16:20.145
{\O'Brian.
Hey, it's me.}

16:20.313 --> 16:23.386
Bazhaev's family {\just }left the courthouse.
They're going to need {\witness }protection.

16:23.511 --> 16:25.775
- I want you to {\pick them up and }bring them in.
- What did he say?

16:25.943 --> 16:28.509
{\He said }The people who are behind
Renee's murder weren't Russian mob.

16:28.746 --> 16:30.874
Said they were people
inside the Russian government.

16:30.999 --> 16:33.116
He claims that {\Moscow is}they're behind
{\everything}what happened today.

16:33.284 --> 16:35.681
I thought the IRK opposition
was trying to stop Hassan.

16:35.806 --> 16:37.482
{\No, }He said the Russians
were{\ just} using them.

16:37.607 --> 16:40.416
He didn't {\have time to }explain why they don't want
the peace accord to go through,

16:40.541 --> 16:42.051
but he did say something important.

16:42.176 --> 16:45.086
He said Moscow's main contact
on the ground was Dana Walsh.

16:45.807 --> 16:47.130
Dana?
You believe that?

16:47.722 --> 16:50.091
That would explain
how she managed to breach CTU.

16:50.259 --> 16:53.511
- {\Anyways, }I'm on my way{\ in}. I want to talk to her.
- I'll set it up. {\- Thanks.}

17:01.259 --> 17:02.395
{\pos(192,230)}{\Cole, }I need your help.

17:02.563 --> 17:04.356
Jack's on his way {\here}to interview Dana.

17:04.523 --> 17:05.874
Dana? What about?

17:06.074 --> 17:08.526
{\According to Jack,}She's some kind of agent
with the Russian government.

17:10.554 --> 17:13.173
He says they're behind
everything that happened today.{\,including Renee's murder.}

17:14.351 --> 17:15.157
{\Listen,}

17:15.453 --> 17:18.565
If {\Dana}she knows who killed Renee or Jack
thinks she's in any way responsible,

17:18.690 --> 17:20.372
there's no telling what he might do.

17:21.838 --> 17:23.750
{\Jack }He respects you.
You might be the only one

17:23.917 --> 17:26.044
who can deal with things
if he gets out of hand.

17:27.882 --> 17:29.834
I know this is difficult for you,

17:31.050 --> 17:33.394
- but during the questioning...
- {\Yeah,}I'll be there.

17:33.519 --> 17:34.344
{\Thanks.}

17:44.531 --> 17:46.262
It's good to be back in the game,

17:46.884 --> 17:48.895
even if it is
through the rear entrance.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.500
President Taylor's worried
about her image.

17:53.038 --> 17:55.198
{\Huh, }Believe me,
I of all people understand that.

17:56.042 --> 17:58.048
She can't keep you
hidden away forever{\, sir}.

17:58.173 --> 17:59.078
That's right.

17:59.203 --> 18:01.830
Credit given where credit is due.
Publicly.

18:02.913 --> 18:04.213
That's our deal.{\- Yeah.}

18:10.548 --> 18:11.548
Right.

18:14.807 --> 18:17.095
{\No, }Believe me,
the president will be grateful to know.

18:20.331 --> 18:22.914
Who is that agent?
I want him reassigned.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.979
- {\Sir,}That was {\one of }my contact{\s} at Justice{\ just}...
- Did you hear me?{\Yes.}

18:26.147 --> 18:28.690
I'll take care of it.
But we have a more immediate problem.

18:39.315 --> 18:40.924
What does he have to do with {\any of }this?

18:41.049 --> 18:44.581
He was{\ just downtown} at the federal courthouse,
the arraignment of a Sergei Bazhaev.

18:45.598 --> 18:48.182
Bauer got to him behind closed doors
and got him to talk.

18:48.307 --> 18:50.712
- How much does {\this }Bazhaev know?
- He knows about Dana Walsh,

18:51.241 --> 18:54.443
- the mole the Russians planted at CTU.
- I know who she is.

18:56.073 --> 18:57.673
Bauer's headed to CTU,

18:58.196 --> 18:59.996
presumably to talk to her.

19:02.376 --> 19:04.994
{\Sir, }My sources tell me
Walsh hasn't given up anything

19:05.119 --> 19:07.463
about Moscow's involvement.
Not yet.

19:08.053 --> 19:10.416
But she knows enough
to bring everything down.

19:10.600 --> 19:13.341
- If she gets in a room with him...
- Obviously, that can't happen.

19:13.466 --> 19:15.445
We need to stop Bauer
before he talks to her.

19:16.016 --> 19:18.419
That won't be easy.
He may have a personal stake in this.

19:18.544 --> 19:21.284
Apparently, he was asking
Bazhaev about a Renee Walker.

19:22.222 --> 19:25.073
She was shot dead in Bauer's apartment
less than an hour ago.

19:31.475 --> 19:33.289
{\Sir, }This could easily get out of hand.

19:34.308 --> 19:37.083
You may need to ask
President Taylor to intervene.

19:37.718 --> 19:39.559
{\What }Are you suggesting
that I tell her the truth?

19:39.684 --> 19:42.722
If she finds out what they've done,{\Russians have one,}
she'll be furious I kept her out of it.

19:44.045 --> 19:47.435
- She might back out of our deal.
- {\Sir, }You really need to stop Bauer now.

19:49.172 --> 19:50.951
I don't see any other way.

19:51.076 --> 19:53.276
You have to talk to the president.

19:57.939 --> 19:59.979
Bauer torpedoed my presidency.

20:01.130 --> 20:02.709
Tried to ruin me, almost did.

20:04.996 --> 20:07.307
There's no way
I'm gonna let that happen again.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.088
{\pos(192,230)}Thank you.

20:15.902 --> 20:18.828
- Dana Walsh ready?
- Yes, I'll take you to her.

20:20.238 --> 20:21.836
I'm so sorry about Renee.

20:22.314 --> 20:24.314
I don't even know what to say.

20:24.439 --> 20:26.360
Dana know I'm going to be
interrogating her?

20:26.600 --> 20:29.071
- {\No, }I didn't want to give her a heads-up.
- Good.

20:42.370 --> 20:43.970
I'm sorry about Renee.

20:49.552 --> 20:51.291
I have to leave the cameras on{\, Jack}.

20:51.538 --> 20:52.876
You think I'm gonna kill her?

20:53.973 --> 20:55.169
I wouldn't blame{\ you if you did}.

20:57.846 --> 20:59.666
If I wanted her dead,{\ Chloe,} she'd be dead.

21:01.011 --> 21:03.689
I'm just gonna wake her up
to the idea of it.

21:06.432 --> 21:07.632
Open the door.

21:20.122 --> 21:21.112
What do you want?

21:26.447 --> 21:28.327
I want to know
who killed Renee Walker.

21:29.256 --> 21:30.121
{\Renee's}She's dead?

21:34.085 --> 21:35.997
That doesn't make any sense.

21:36.888 --> 21:38.296
It must have been a mistake.

21:39.891 --> 21:40.941
No mistake.

21:44.723 --> 21:45.723
I'm sorry.{\.. Jack.}

21:48.815 --> 21:49.641
Really.

21:51.124 --> 21:52.274
You're sorry?

21:57.746 --> 21:58.896
You're sorry?

22:00.720 --> 22:01.903
I want{\ to know who} the shooter{\ was}!

22:02.988 --> 22:04.989
I want to know ordered it!
I want names{\ now}!

22:05.741 --> 22:07.385
- Stop him!
- Let it play{\, Chloe}.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.231
<i>Stop.{\You hit me, and} Or you get nothing.</i>

22:09.356 --> 22:11.496
You think you get
to make demands here?

22:13.121 --> 22:14.373
I can give you the hitter,

22:15.448 --> 22:16.709
the man behind him,

22:17.051 --> 22:19.059
- all the way up to the top.
- I want more,

22:19.296 --> 22:22.246
- than just names. I want proof!
- I have proof.

22:22.790 --> 22:23.990
An audio file,

22:25.302 --> 22:26.886
- film.
- Where?

22:29.023 --> 22:31.273
First I want my immunity deal back.

22:33.052 --> 22:35.252
Soon as I start talking, I'm dead.

22:39.615 --> 22:40.615
Your move{\, Jack}.

22:52.049 --> 22:53.037
If you lie to me.

22:55.252 --> 22:57.693
I'll find you
no matter where you try and hide.

22:58.537 --> 23:00.037
You understand that?

23:03.989 --> 23:04.989
Good.

23:20.941 --> 23:23.466
{\pub}We've had such little good news
these last few hours,

23:23.591 --> 23:26.404
I wanted to tell you right away.
The delegates have voted

23:26.572 --> 23:29.610
unanimously to accept you
as the representative of the IRK

23:29.735 --> 23:32.243
- at the signing of the treaty.
- I'm pleased.

23:33.557 --> 23:35.607
Thank you for all your efforts.

23:35.785 --> 23:37.035
You're welcome.

23:37.361 --> 23:39.407
There is one proviso, of course.

23:39.532 --> 23:42.185
That my own country accept me
as signatory of the treaty.

23:42.561 --> 23:44.891
I know you've had very little time
to pursue this.

23:45.016 --> 23:46.632
Jamot and I have
been making progress.

23:47.484 --> 23:50.569
{\In the next hour,}Our constituent assembly
will vote on the issue,

23:51.382 --> 23:53.463
but as we've already
received pledges of loyalty

23:53.588 --> 23:55.646
from most of my husband's coalition,

23:56.228 --> 23:58.254
I believe we have a good chance
of success.

23:58.379 --> 23:59.379
Excellent.{\ Dalia,}

24:01.288 --> 24:03.898
- We might just make it yet.
- We might.

24:06.842 --> 24:07.904
I need a word.

24:08.619 --> 24:09.619
Excuse me.

24:12.859 --> 24:15.385
- Logan wants to speak with you.
- About what?

24:15.510 --> 24:17.793
He wouldn't say
except that it's urgent.

24:17.918 --> 24:19.718
He's waiting in your office.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.364
{\pos(192,230)}<i>Following President Hassan's death,</i>

24:22.489 --> 24:24.337
{\pos(192,230)}<i>the expectation
was that the delegates</i>

24:24.505 --> 24:27.159
{\pos(192,190)}<i>to the peace conference,
would have to pack up and go home.</i>

24:27.284 --> 24:30.600
{\pos(192,205)}<i>But the latest rumors coming out
of the UN are pretty sensational.</i>

24:30.825 --> 24:32.845
{\pos(192,240)}<i>That Dalia Hassan might be stepping</i>

24:33.013 --> 24:34.240
<i>into her husband's shoes.</i>

24:34.365 --> 24:36.307
<i>{\In fact, }There are already
street demonstrations</i>

24:36.924 --> 24:38.732
{\pos(192,215)}<i>taking place in Kamistan</i>

24:39.144 --> 24:40.686
<i>in support{\ of} Mrs{\Dalia} Hassan{\'s candidacy}.</i>

24:42.898 --> 24:45.298
- The president is here.
- Thank you.

24:53.614 --> 24:55.228
Thank you for seeing me{\, Madam President}.

24:55.353 --> 24:57.531
Ethan said you wanted
to speak with me.

24:58.319 --> 25:00.158
Can we have the room, please?

25:15.262 --> 25:17.682
- What's this about{\, Chaes}?
- Jack Bauer. He's out of control.

25:17.891 --> 25:19.491
He's already pressured

25:19.616 --> 25:22.353
a Russian mafioso in federal court,
and {\now }he's on his way

25:22.787 --> 25:25.307
to question a woman
in custody at CTU{\: Dana Walsh}.

25:27.320 --> 25:28.776
Why does he want to talk to her?

25:28.944 --> 25:32.613
He thinks she knows who's behind
the shooting of a Renee Walker.

25:35.535 --> 25:36.576
Agent Walker?

25:38.663 --> 25:39.537
She's dead?

25:48.469 --> 25:49.720
How did this happen?

25:50.132 --> 25:52.341
That's still being investigated,
but in the meantime,

25:52.509 --> 25:54.927
what I'm saying is
Bauer needs to be stopped.

25:55.970 --> 25:56.804
Why?

25:58.454 --> 26:02.328
You're going to have to trust me.
What we need to do right now

26:02.978 --> 26:05.396
- is lock Bauer down.
- You better tell me exactly

26:05.564 --> 26:06.674
what's going on.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.567
I won't do a thing about Jack Bauer

26:10.692 --> 26:12.361
until you tell me the truth.

26:20.427 --> 26:22.161
Elements inside
the Russian government

26:22.286 --> 26:25.063
were behind both
the assassination of President Hassan

26:25.188 --> 26:27.960
and the supply of nuclear material

26:28.461 --> 26:29.711
to his enemies.

26:31.204 --> 26:34.133
- The Russian government?
- Why{\ do you think} they're back at the table?

26:34.652 --> 26:36.427
Because I threatened to expose

26:36.595 --> 26:38.328
their role in today's events.

26:38.865 --> 26:40.139
You knew about this

26:40.307 --> 26:42.475
- and you didn't tell{\ anyone}?
- I {\was trying to }protected the President.

26:42.643 --> 26:43.643
Protected her?

26:45.062 --> 26:47.108
You've compromised her hopelessly!

26:47.731 --> 26:49.482
Why didn't you say anything before?

26:50.036 --> 26:52.375
I told you that I had leverage
with the Russians.

26:52.844 --> 26:54.969
You must've understood
it was significant.

26:55.094 --> 26:57.615
Significant, yes!
Evidence of a sex scandal,

26:58.060 --> 26:59.784
some kind of financial malfeasance,

27:00.058 --> 27:01.808
not this, for God's sake!

27:04.904 --> 27:06.004
If I find...

27:06.865 --> 27:08.626
that you were
in a position to prevent

27:08.794 --> 27:10.061
- anything...
- No{\Absolutely not}.

27:10.186 --> 27:12.088
This information
came to me only {\very }recently.

27:12.549 --> 27:13.422
From whom?

27:14.882 --> 27:16.592
- I can't tell you.
- You will{\ tell me}.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.902
I can't, Madam President,
because it would do no good.

27:20.027 --> 27:22.476
My sources would plausibly deny,

27:23.127 --> 27:24.267
even knowing me.

27:28.744 --> 27:32.233
Bauer is about to bring out the Russian
involvement into the open?

27:32.401 --> 27:34.944
If he talks to Dana Walsh, yes.

27:35.983 --> 27:38.071
The Russians inserted her at CTU
months ago.

27:38.196 --> 27:39.696
She was their agent.

27:40.317 --> 27:42.144
If Bauer gets to her,

27:42.436 --> 27:45.279
it will all come out,
and then this, this...

27:45.871 --> 27:47.397
will all be finished.

27:47.522 --> 27:49.122
It's finished anyways.

27:49.527 --> 27:52.377
Do you think the president wants
anything more to do with the Russians

27:52.502 --> 27:53.910
after what they've done?

27:55.995 --> 27:58.426
You do, Madame President,
because you

27:58.594 --> 28:00.794
are looking at the bigger picture,

28:01.576 --> 28:02.638
the greater good.

28:02.806 --> 28:04.765
How can you call any of this good?

28:04.933 --> 28:07.310
Because it is good,
an undeniable good!

28:07.478 --> 28:10.146
A peace that's escaped the world
for generations!

28:10.372 --> 28:12.364
That's what you're on the verge
of achieving.

28:12.489 --> 28:14.317
Do you really want
to throw it all away?

28:15.163 --> 28:16.235
Do you really think

28:16.403 --> 28:18.404
Dalia Hassan will sit down
at the table

28:18.935 --> 28:21.535
with the people
who murdered her husband?

28:22.295 --> 28:24.045
Who says she has to know?

28:28.291 --> 28:30.615
Believe me, I know
how hard you worked for this,

28:30.740 --> 28:34.086
how you sweated and prayed,
the sleepless nights.

28:34.254 --> 28:35.254
I know.

28:35.832 --> 28:39.449
The power to make a difference...
that's why we came into politics.

28:39.667 --> 28:40.593
How few of us

28:40.925 --> 28:42.325
get to achieve it,

28:42.697 --> 28:43.947
but you have...

28:45.282 --> 28:48.127
You so nearly have.

28:48.894 --> 28:50.686
Ethan will tell you to make a stand.

28:50.854 --> 28:53.814
I applaud his moral clarity,
but then he's on the sidelines.

28:53.982 --> 28:55.733
- He can afford it.
- That's enough!

28:55.901 --> 28:57.818
Is the situation ideal? No!

28:58.169 --> 28:59.269
Far from it,

28:59.814 --> 29:02.020
but you have a real chance

29:03.979 --> 29:06.077
to make the world a better place.

29:11.245 --> 29:13.086
Don't listen to this, Allison.

29:14.238 --> 29:16.796
If the treaty's not signed today,
it's not the end.

29:18.021 --> 29:19.548
You can build a better peace,

29:20.249 --> 29:21.808
with honest partners.

29:22.302 --> 29:23.993
"There is a tide
in the affairs of men,

29:24.118 --> 29:27.264
"which, taken at the flood,
leads on to fortune."

29:27.778 --> 29:29.562
What the hell does that mean?

29:31.304 --> 29:32.686
The president knows.

29:33.995 --> 29:35.745
It's from Julius Caesar.

29:36.919 --> 29:38.669
It means "Now or never. "

29:42.590 --> 29:44.532
Madam President,
I have Jack Bauer for you.

29:48.631 --> 29:49.578
Where is he?

29:49.746 --> 29:51.468
He's at CTU.
He wants to talk to you

29:51.957 --> 29:54.361
about an immunity agreement
for a Dana Walsh.

29:59.556 --> 30:01.232
I'll have to call him back.

30:06.197 --> 30:07.897
There is no choice here.

30:10.637 --> 30:12.587
But there is a choice, Ethan,

30:13.978 --> 30:16.428
and unfortunately,
only I can make it.

30:26.473 --> 30:27.992
I'm going to CTU.

30:28.510 --> 30:29.368
To do what?

30:32.057 --> 30:33.453
To see Jack Bauer.

30:51.185 --> 30:53.676
{\pub}- Has the president called back yet?
- Not yet.

30:53.801 --> 30:56.182
Are you sure
you want to do this to yourself?

30:56.699 --> 30:58.153
We can take it from here.

30:58.278 --> 31:00.619
The minute Dana's immunity deal
is back in place,

31:00.744 --> 31:02.448
we can roll up the names,
close this out.

31:02.573 --> 31:04.028
I need to see this through.

31:06.244 --> 31:08.384
Excuse me.
The president's on the phone,

31:08.509 --> 31:09.509
line 3.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.285
She asked for Chloe.

31:22.513 --> 31:25.090
- I'm on my way to see you.
- You're coming to CTU?

31:25.748 --> 31:28.566
Yes, I'm almost there.
I need to talk to Jack Bauer.

31:28.691 --> 31:30.427
Make sure he doesn't leave.

31:33.648 --> 31:35.851
Let security know
the president will be here soon.

31:36.019 --> 31:37.055
She's coming here?

31:37.180 --> 31:39.104
That's what I just said.
Have them standing by.

31:42.353 --> 31:44.944
- Why she doing this?
- She said she wants to talk to you.

31:45.268 --> 31:48.004
- Why not just talk to me on the phone?
- I don't know.

31:48.129 --> 31:50.324
You should probably meet her
in Hastings' office.

31:54.365 --> 31:55.365
Fine.

32:22.259 --> 32:24.400
Welcome to CTU.
I'm Chloe O'Brian.

32:24.568 --> 32:26.498
Thank you, Ms. O'Brian.
Is Jack inside?

32:26.623 --> 32:27.873
Right this way.

32:43.391 --> 32:45.738
I want to say how grateful I am

32:46.048 --> 32:47.898
for all your efforts today.

32:49.174 --> 32:51.220
We've taken some pretty hard hits,

32:51.709 --> 32:54.386
but we've managed
to keep ourselves in the game.

32:54.511 --> 32:56.593
The peace process is still alive,

32:58.185 --> 33:00.820
and I am counting on your hard
work and your vigilance

33:00.945 --> 33:02.521
to keep it that way.

33:02.850 --> 33:04.800
I know you won't let me down.

33:24.312 --> 33:26.211
Thank you, Miss O'Brian.
I'll go up alone.

33:46.284 --> 33:47.274
I am so sorry

33:47.843 --> 33:49.293
about Agent Walker.

33:52.635 --> 33:54.323
I gather she meant a lot to you.

33:57.710 --> 33:59.995
Which makes
what I'm about to ask so very,

34:00.163 --> 34:01.163
very hard.

34:03.181 --> 34:04.208
Please, Jack.

34:11.369 --> 34:13.092
I need you to stand down.

34:15.197 --> 34:16.844
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

34:17.745 --> 34:20.599
I do not want you
to question Dana Walsh.

34:21.706 --> 34:24.467
Madam President the information
that I can extract from Dana Walsh

34:24.592 --> 34:27.516
is not limited
to the murder of Renee Walker.

34:27.983 --> 34:30.386
I believe she knows the names
of the people who facilitated

34:30.511 --> 34:31.996
the assassination of Hassan,

34:32.121 --> 34:34.337
people working
within the Russian government.

34:34.960 --> 34:36.197
That is pure speculation.

34:36.366 --> 34:38.636
Then {\grant her immunity.}let me question her.
If she's lying,

34:39.202 --> 34:40.904
- you lose nothing.
- I'm sorry.

34:41.029 --> 34:42.788
I won't give Dana Walsh immunity.

34:43.382 --> 34:44.382
I can't.

34:45.588 --> 34:48.442
The peace process is back on track.

34:49.032 --> 34:51.777
Dalia Hassan will represent
her country at the signing.

34:51.902 --> 34:53.481
The Russians have accepted her

34:53.606 --> 34:55.498
and have undertaken
to support the treaty.

34:55.623 --> 34:57.511
They have been trying
to destroy the treaty.

34:57.900 --> 34:59.930
- You can't trust them.
- You don't know that.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.516
The information that I have
came from Sergei Bazhaev,

35:02.684 --> 35:03.809
and I believe him.

35:03.977 --> 35:06.061
If you let me question Dana Walsh,
I can prove it{\ to you}.

35:08.523 --> 35:09.787
I won't allow it.

35:15.446 --> 35:16.905
You don't want to know the truth.

35:18.383 --> 35:21.797
What I want is to keep
the Russians at the table.

35:22.351 --> 35:24.710
Allegations of this sort
will drive them away.

35:24.835 --> 35:26.206
What if they{\ allegations} are true?

35:26.374 --> 35:30.096
If I keep the Russians at the table,
I can bring peace to a part of the world

35:30.221 --> 35:33.535
that has known nothing but war
for generations.

35:34.357 --> 35:37.943
That is the greater good
that I am working toward.

35:38.461 --> 35:40.512
And to achieve it,
there have to be sacrifices!

35:41.029 --> 35:42.616
With all due respect,{\ Madam President,}

35:42.741 --> 35:45.851
these people gave {\nuclear }weapons to terrorists
who were willing to erase{\obliterate half of } Manhattan!

35:46.469 --> 35:47.728
You don't know that!

35:48.685 --> 35:51.690
And I'm telling you,
we have to move on.

35:52.915 --> 35:55.216
Even Hassan's widow
has picked up the torch

35:55.341 --> 35:56.828
and is continuing this{\peace} process.

35:56.953 --> 35:59.124
Does she know the Russians
helped murder her husband?

35:59.249 --> 36:01.612
{\Do you think }Would she be willing
to sign that treaty if she knew that?

36:01.737 --> 36:03.358
- Have you even told her?
- {\That's }Enough.

36:03.483 --> 36:05.996
- Have you told her?
- I said that's enough!

36:10.724 --> 36:13.158
This peace treaty
is in the interests

36:13.283 --> 36:15.636
of the United States
and of the world.

36:16.386 --> 36:19.051
That makes it a good in itself,
and certainly

36:19.219 --> 36:21.308
more important
than your desire for revenge.

36:21.433 --> 36:24.431
Madam President,
I don't want revenge, I want justice.

36:25.502 --> 36:27.100
And I want peace.

36:28.599 --> 36:31.436
If there were another way,
I would take it, but there's not.

36:32.576 --> 36:34.026
That's my decision.

36:34.858 --> 36:36.026
Do you understand?

36:39.703 --> 36:41.365
Do you understand, Jack?

36:50.637 --> 36:53.168
I've arranged a helicopter
to fly you from CTU

36:53.336 --> 36:54.837
to McGuire Air Force Base.

36:56.425 --> 36:57.714
You're locking me down.

36:59.585 --> 37:00.926
You'll be debriefed there.

37:05.183 --> 37:06.433
Good-bye, Jack.

37:09.105 --> 37:10.105
I'm sorry.

37:31.902 --> 37:34.349
- I had them gather your things.
- Thanks.

37:34.474 --> 37:35.929
- What happened{\ up there}?
- Nothing.

37:36.054 --> 37:38.777
- What do you mean?
- I mean nothing.

37:38.902 --> 37:40.252
Nothing happened.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.536
{\pub}What I need is a meeting
with Dalia Hassan

38:02.661 --> 38:04.752
to coordinate our response
to the likely questions.

38:04.877 --> 38:06.304
Will you set that up?

38:07.004 --> 38:08.160
Thank you.

38:08.328 --> 38:10.579
I'm leaving CTU now.
I'll be with you

38:10.747 --> 38:12.064
in ten minutes.

38:13.587 --> 38:15.500
They said you wanted to see me.

38:19.928 --> 38:23.573
Dana Walsh is to remain locked down
until further notice.

38:23.698 --> 38:26.694
No one gets access to her
without my express permission.

38:26.819 --> 38:28.019
Is that clear?

38:28.866 --> 38:29.984
I guess.

38:30.109 --> 38:31.141
What about Jack?

38:31.694 --> 38:34.684
Jack is going to McGuire
Air Force Base to be debriefed.

38:35.603 --> 38:37.781
He didn't seem very happy
about that.

38:38.664 --> 38:40.705
He was disappointed I wouldn't grant

38:40.830 --> 38:42.861
{\Dana }Walsh immunity
in exchange for her testimony.

38:44.237 --> 38:46.448
But Dana knows
who's responsible for {\everything that's happened }today.

38:46.916 --> 38:48.492
She is a sociopath.

38:49.543 --> 38:51.043
She'll say anything.

38:51.702 --> 38:54.700
And the last thing we need right now
is a bunch of unfounded allegations

38:54.825 --> 38:57.330
derailing the peace
that we've all worked so hard for.

38:57.455 --> 38:58.855
Do you understand?

39:02.913 --> 39:05.592
We're having a press conference
at the UN in two hours

39:05.760 --> 39:08.613
to present Dalia Hassan
as the new leader of the IRK

39:08.738 --> 39:11.024
and to announce that the peace talks
are still on track.

39:11.149 --> 39:13.016
What we need CTU to do
is to make sure

39:13.184 --> 39:15.154
security is airtight.

39:24.673 --> 39:27.058
Tim Woods speaks very highly of you.

39:27.999 --> 39:31.660
When the situation got out of control,
he was {\quite }adamant that you were the one

39:31.957 --> 39:33.107
to take over.

39:34.125 --> 39:36.039
I'm surprised
he even knows who I am.

39:38.114 --> 39:40.419
It was a pleasure
to meet you finally, Chloe.

39:41.414 --> 39:42.414
Thank you.

39:59.060 --> 40:01.146
Cole, we're gonna be back
on UN detail.

40:01.271 --> 40:03.900
- What's happening with Dana?
- As of now, nothing.

40:04.068 --> 40:06.319
- The immunity agreement?
- There won't be any.

40:06.487 --> 40:07.572
Why not?

40:07.697 --> 40:09.898
The president says
Dana's a lying sociopath

40:10.023 --> 40:11.873
who will wreck the peace treaty.

40:11.998 --> 40:14.376
- What's Jack say about that?
- I don't know.

40:14.501 --> 40:17.126
He's being choppered to McGuire
for debriefing.

40:18.278 --> 40:20.042
Chloe, what the hell's going on?

40:20.582 --> 40:23.670
There will be a press conference soon,
{\the president needs}it's up to us to guarantee security.

40:24.123 --> 40:26.227
You'll need to get your teams ready.

40:47.767 --> 40:50.367
So Jack's being taken away
for a debrief?

40:50.673 --> 40:52.908
- About what, may I ask?
- No.

40:53.541 --> 40:55.452
<i>Director O'Brian,
this is Falcon One.</i>

40:55.620 --> 40:57.733
- <i>We're touching down at CTU.</i>
- Copy that.

40:58.248 --> 41:00.665
Security personnel en route to the roof
with Jack Bauer{\ now}.

41:22.703 --> 41:24.481
Mr. Bauer, Agent Winnick.

41:24.649 --> 41:26.191
{\The White House has instructed me}I have to escort you

41:26.359 --> 41:28.217
to McGuire Air Force Base
for a debrief.

41:37.251 --> 41:38.910
Heard a lot about you, sir.

41:39.035 --> 41:41.367
I'm sorry we had to meet
under these circumstances.

41:41.492 --> 41:43.360
There's no reason to be sorry.

41:52.597 --> 41:53.950
I'm taking this helicopter.

41:54.075 --> 41:56.263
Tell your men to drop their weapons
or you'll die.

42:02.418 --> 42:04.480
Arlo, pull up the audio.
Something's happening.

42:04.605 --> 42:05.438
Coming up.

42:06.095 --> 42:07.702
<i>Put your weapons down now!</i>

42:07.827 --> 42:09.062
<i>I will kill him!</i>

42:09.187 --> 42:12.373
All security to the helipad now.

42:12.498 --> 42:15.574
- What's going on?
- He's gonna steal that helicopter.{\We have a hostage situation.}

42:18.683 --> 42:20.283
Out of the copter now!

42:20.872 --> 42:23.707
<i>Bauer took a hostage.
Hijacking the helicopter.</i>

42:29.255 --> 42:31.506
Hold your fire!
Lower your weapons!

42:34.385 --> 42:35.885
Give me your walkie.

42:37.414 --> 42:38.722
<i>{\Please }Land the chopper now.</i>

42:40.746 --> 42:44.311
You know I have to call this in.
The Air Force will force you down.

42:44.479 --> 42:46.688
This is a bad idea.
Land the chopper

42:46.856 --> 42:47.937
<i>now.</i>

42:50.109 --> 42:52.903
