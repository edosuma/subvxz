01:01.688 --> 01:04.554
Gotta be somewhere.
You wanna keep goin'?

01:09.819 --> 01:11.319
Officer Smith, ma'am.

01:13.885 --> 01:14.985
We're looking for a man
went after a woman last night

01:15.085 --> 01:17.352
at esplanda apartments,
the ones right behind you.

01:17.451 --> 01:20.883
Heard anything unusual?
- No, sorry.

01:20.986 --> 01:21.885
Oh my God,
that's terrible.

01:21.985 --> 01:23.319
Is the woman alright?
- Huh?

01:23.450 --> 01:24.618
- The woman,
is she alright?

01:24.719 --> 01:26.519
Yeah. Yeah, she good.

01:31.819 --> 01:33.852
- Excuse me, my brother,
Omar little,

01:33.982 --> 01:36.383
came here last night.
He fell out the damn window.

01:37.917 --> 01:39.017
- We don't have
anyone by that name.

01:39.116 --> 01:40.816
- He was kinda,
ya know, high.

01:40.913 --> 01:42.115
Probably messed up his name.

01:42.281 --> 01:44.717
Real dark,
got himself a scar.

01:44.817 --> 01:46.450
Legs should
be busted up real bad.

01:46.549 --> 01:48.982
- No one with that type
of injury came in last night.

01:57.280 --> 02:00.382
- Not a goddamn thing. Been
in every trashcan, dumpster,

02:00.447 --> 02:02.714
vacant for three blocks
'round. Nothin'.

02:02.813 --> 02:04.446
We even checked
down the sewers.

02:09.579 --> 02:11.044
Marlo wanna meet.

02:11.212 --> 02:12.746
- So what you
want us to do?

02:25.045 --> 02:26.112
Which one?

02:37.009 --> 02:39.043
Don't seem possible.

02:39.143 --> 02:40.210
It don't.

02:40.311 --> 02:45.578
- That some
Spiderman shit there.

02:45.675 --> 02:47.308
We missed our shot.

02:48.675 --> 02:50.109
Now he gonna be at us.

04:41.262 --> 04:43.563
- Usually, my staff
tries to keep sharp objects

04:43.627 --> 04:45.293
out of my hands.

04:53.595 --> 04:55.661
You know, it all
started with Charles center and

04:55.829 --> 04:57.961
Tommy d'alesandro and
it continued with William Donald

04:58.094 --> 05:01.027
schaefer and harborplace.
And following that,

05:01.126 --> 05:04.660
there were mayors schmoke and
o'malley with inner harbor east.

05:04.761 --> 05:07.026
Well, today it is my
administration's turn to

05:07.127 --> 05:09.026
lay claim to the middle
branch of the patapsco and

05:09.126 --> 05:11.859
what will soon become
known as new westport,

05:11.892 --> 05:14.290
revitalizing another
waterfront area of

05:14.393 --> 05:16.493
our great city.
Thank you.

05:19.093 --> 05:23.828
- Say g'bye to locust
point south.

05:23.989 --> 05:25.390
Fuck you, Krawczyk.

05:25.491 --> 05:28.790
Yeah, fuck you,
greedhead motherfucker.

05:28.855 --> 05:31.322
Fuck you for tearing down
the port of Baltimore and

05:31.491 --> 05:33.956
selling it to some yuppie
assholes from washington.

05:34.055 --> 05:35.321
- C'mon buddy.
- This is bullshit.

05:35.421 --> 05:37.154
Who the hell's that?

05:37.287 --> 05:43.655
- Oh that's nobody,
Mr. Mayor. It's nobody at all.

07:22.444 --> 07:26.277
- Ya happy now, bitch?
- I am content, yes.

07:26.376 --> 07:29.643
- You called the
reporter, huh? - no, actually.

07:29.741 --> 07:32.906
That asshole's making up
his own shit.

07:33.009 --> 07:36.344
Brass called a press
conference for this afternoon.

07:36.441 --> 07:38.041
They're gonna be shoveling
so much money at

07:38.241 --> 07:40.308
my bullshit it'll make
your head spin.

07:40.409 --> 07:43.142
- What's with all the casework?
- Bodies from the vacants.

07:46.472 --> 07:49.105
- And some of them have
been worked pretty good.

07:49.207 --> 07:50.774
You know what, Jimmy?

07:50.907 --> 07:52.207
I'm gonna go
back to the beginning and work

07:52.307 --> 07:55.109
every one of them again.
Back to square one.

07:55.207 --> 07:56.774
You know why?
Because I'm a murder police.

07:56.839 --> 07:59.939
I work murders.
I don't fuck with

08:00.039 --> 08:02.173
no make-believe,
I don't jerk shit around.

08:02.306 --> 08:04.673
I catch a murder
and I work it.

08:04.772 --> 08:07.539
Working this shit
like I'm supposed to.

08:07.672 --> 08:10.938
- Well, lemme know
if you need anything, alright?

08:11.037 --> 08:12.771
Cars, some o.t.,
some lab work...

08:12.870 --> 08:14.404
Anything you need.

08:14.571 --> 08:16.771
Because in... Three or
four hours the money's

08:16.871 --> 08:19.338
gonna flow on my case.
Whatever you need, Bunk,

08:19.437 --> 08:20.337
I'm probably
gonna have more of

08:20.471 --> 08:28.837
it than
even Lester could use.

08:28.936 --> 08:31.203
- To be that
close to a serial killer.

08:31.336 --> 08:32.769
It must be weird.

08:32.868 --> 08:34.602
Kinda. Yeah.

08:34.668 --> 08:36.467
Wonderful story, Scott.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.767
- Yeah, well, it kinda
wrote itself.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.033
I mean, it's a lucky thing
to have the guy call m

08:40.133 --> 08:41.832
like he did...
- Well it comes

08:41.933 --> 08:43.301
from you pounding the
pavement, right?

08:43.400 --> 08:44.600
That's more than luck.
That's putting yourself in

08:44.669 --> 08:46.168
the place where the story
comes to you.

08:46.267 --> 08:48.067
What do you have for tomorrow?
- For tomorrow?

08:48.166 --> 08:52.333
- This is not the kind of thing
we let go of after a day or two.

08:52.435 --> 08:55.001
- I, um, you know,
I was thinking that if I spent

08:55.130 --> 08:56.798
a night with the homeless,
you know.

08:56.898 --> 08:59.431
Did what they did. Saw what
they saw. That kind of thing.

08:59.534 --> 09:01.032
I mean, if it's
an overnight thing,

09:01.133 --> 09:02.767
I couldn't get it for tomorrow,
but the next day, sure...

09:02.864 --> 09:04.131
That's great.

09:04.230 --> 09:07.798
That could be the perfect
follow. I'll speak to Gus.

09:07.899 --> 09:09.232
- Also, Scott,
we've been taking calls

09:09.332 --> 09:11.264
from some of the national
networks and cable outlets.

09:11.432 --> 09:12.531
They're looking
for you to go on-camera.

09:12.598 --> 09:14.699
- Me? On television?
- I'd avoid the locals,

09:14.796 --> 09:17.597
but if you can do the nationalstuff in a

09:17.698 --> 09:20.198
- sure, yeah. I mean I'm
just not all that comfortable

09:20.328 --> 09:23.194
having myself in the
center of the story like this.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.730
- Of course not. But there is
a way of handling

09:24.829 --> 09:25.996
this responsibly, I think.

09:26.096 --> 09:27.563
Just remember you're an
ambassador for the paper.

09:31.627 --> 09:33.261
Star time.

09:34.828 --> 09:36.195
Yeah.

09:36.362 --> 09:37.729
How 'bout that?

09:37.827 --> 09:39.994
- Homelessness.
- Our coverage should reflect

09:40.094 --> 09:42.528
the diensian aspect
of the homeless.

09:42.628 --> 09:43.794
The human element.

09:43.960 --> 09:46.461
Scott will lead it off,
spending a night on the streets

09:46.527 --> 09:48.226
and
writing from that perspective.

09:48.359 --> 09:50.260
- Scott? He's the
lead on your education project.

09:50.359 --> 09:51.794
I think we need
to get him back on the...

09:51.926 --> 09:55.460
- I don't see the...
The school project as yielding

09:55.558 --> 09:57.291
the same kind of
impact as our attention

09:57.392 --> 09:59.125
to homelessness can.

09:59.193 --> 10:01.926
These murders, the phone
call to our reporter.

10:02.091 --> 10:04.190
It really opens up the
issue, don't you think?

10:04.292 --> 10:06.124
- Yeah, but...
- From now til the end of the year,

10:06.257 --> 10:08.824
let's focus not only
on covering the murders,

10:08.924 --> 10:12.891
but on the... The nature
of homelessness itself.

10:12.990 --> 10:14.724
- The dickensian
aspect of it. Yeah.

10:20.656 --> 10:22.723
- I've reached
a point, detective Sydnor,

10:24.022 --> 10:26.488
where I no longer have
the time or patience left

10:26.590 --> 10:28.955
to address myself to the
needs of the system

10:29.054 --> 10:30.654
within which we work.

10:32.321 --> 10:34.187
I'm tired.
- You're gonna quit?

10:34.289 --> 10:35.922
Not yet. Not just yet.

10:36.021 --> 10:37.756
- So what are you
talking about?

10:37.854 --> 10:40.756
- When they took us
off Marlo this last time,

10:40.852 --> 10:41.852
when they
said they couldn't

10:41.954 --> 10:45.155
pay for
further investigation...

10:45.321 --> 10:47.952
I regarded that decision
as illegitimate.

10:48.019 --> 10:49.753
- Illegitimate?
- And so...

10:49.852 --> 10:52.286
I'm responding in kind.
I'm going to press a case

10:52.385 --> 10:56.218
against Marlo Stanfield without
regard to the usual rules.

11:08.948 --> 11:12.949
I'm running an illegal wiretap
on Marlo Stanfield's cellphone.

11:13.050 --> 11:14.050
Fuck, Lester.

11:14.182 --> 11:15.617
- If you have a problem
with this,

11:15.750 --> 11:17.884
I understand completely

11:18.016 --> 11:20.216
and urge you
to get as far fucking

11:20.317 --> 11:21.949
away from me as you can.

11:45.679 --> 11:48.313
- You remember
this one here?

11:48.414 --> 11:49.979
Backed away from jackin'
the boy up

11:50.147 --> 11:53.513
outta respect for that goofy
motherfucker pryzbylewski.

11:53.613 --> 11:56.879
Wonder what the young man might
tell me a year later, though...

11:56.978 --> 11:58.345
Bunk.

11:58.446 --> 12:01.079
- What the fuck is this?
- Vernon here did a search

12:01.245 --> 12:02.778
warrant on
his dead guy's appliance store,

12:02.877 --> 12:05.711
pulled all of that
out of the desk drawer.

12:05.878 --> 12:07.644
- Grand jury shit?
- Transcris,

12:07.743 --> 12:09.444
sealed indictments...
- Who's your murder?

12:09.543 --> 12:12.009
- Eastside dealer by
the name of Joe Stewart.

12:12.078 --> 12:13.745
Caught one in the back of
his head the other night.

12:13.909 --> 12:15.743
- Somebody finally
touched prop Joe, huh?

12:15.809 --> 12:17.275
Hmm-hmm.

12:17.376 --> 12:19.908
- you remember when narcotics
indicted Charlie burman last year?

12:20.010 --> 12:22.345
Motherfucker ran a couple
days before the raids,

12:22.441 --> 12:23.374
still on the wing.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.376
- The sealed indictments
are all in there.

12:25.544 --> 12:27.176
Every one of 'em.

12:29.175 --> 12:31.275
- Who don't we trust
at the courthouse?

12:31.340 --> 12:32.706
They put cheese on them fries?

12:32.806 --> 12:34.240
They can. Chili too.

12:34.339 --> 12:36.272
- Alright then.
- You want a drink with that?

12:36.372 --> 12:37.906
- Strawberry lemonade.
- Alright, I'm on it.

12:38.006 --> 12:40.839
- They're back on cellphones.
After more than a year?

12:40.939 --> 12:42.839
That they are.

12:42.938 --> 12:44.673
- Tell me they're
talking in code, Lester.

12:44.805 --> 12:46.739
I wanna go to jail
for snatchin' something better

12:46.905 --> 12:48.906
than Marlo Stanfield's
fucking lunch order.

12:49.006 --> 12:50.073
- There's no code that
I can tell.

12:50.172 --> 12:51.373
I've got a half dozen calls,

12:51.471 --> 12:55.938
all routine. No drug talk,
no numbers, no times...

12:56.005 --> 12:57.639
Nothing but what they seem.

12:57.739 --> 12:59.572
- So he ain't doing
business with the phone then.

12:59.704 --> 13:01.936
So take this mess down.
Let's get the fuck outta here.

13:02.072 --> 13:03.838
I also have five calls,

13:03.938 --> 13:05.572
thirty to forty
seconds duration,

13:05.636 --> 13:07.902
each one picked up
on the first ring,

13:08.002 --> 13:10.201
each one with
nothing whatsoever

13:10.371 --> 13:14.138
said between parties.
You see? When they talk,

13:14.237 --> 13:15.369
it's bullshit.

13:15.403 --> 13:18.236
But there are calls where
no one says a thing.

13:18.367 --> 13:21.134
Thirty seconds,
without conversation.

13:26.768 --> 13:27.867
Is he...

13:29.403 --> 13:30.568
We talked it through,

13:30.670 --> 13:31.670
he knows the risks.

13:31.768 --> 13:33.768
- I'm in.
If it makes the fucking case,

13:33.868 --> 13:35.101
I'm in all the way.

13:36.734 --> 13:38.134
So, what's up now?

13:38.266 --> 13:39.199
They talking dirt?

13:39.302 --> 13:40.201
no.

13:40.301 --> 13:41.301
Lester. Fuck.

13:41.398 --> 13:43.299
Marlo's not gonna
talk dirt on the phone,

13:43.465 --> 13:44.298
but there's
something to this.

13:44.467 --> 13:45.768
I just haven't
figured it out.

13:47.867 --> 13:49.534
We could use some more manpower.

13:49.666 --> 13:50.798
We need a couple of
surveillance teams

13:50.931 --> 13:54.065
to get on these guys to see how
they using the phones.

13:54.132 --> 13:56.032
- You see the
newspaper today?

13:56.132 --> 13:57.699
Headline like that,
the bosses are gonna start

13:57.864 --> 13:59.797
throwing money at
the homeless murders.

14:01.031 --> 14:03.131
When they do, I'll peel
off a couple detectives,

14:03.232 --> 14:05.431
throw them your way.

14:11.396 --> 14:12.695
The homeless murders?

14:12.830 --> 14:15.331
How does that case
tangle in with this?

14:15.428 --> 14:17.061
Hard to explain.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.496
- Remember what the d.n.c.
Folks told me two years ago?

14:24.594 --> 14:26.627
What I needed to do to
take the statehouse?

14:26.728 --> 14:29.161
- Build something downtown
and stick your name on it,

14:29.262 --> 14:32.361
get the crime to go down,
and stay away from schools.

14:32.495 --> 14:33.993
- And keep my
boyish good looks.

14:34.129 --> 14:35.995
- One out of
four ain't bad.

14:36.061 --> 14:37.128
Jesus.

14:38.260 --> 14:39.361
Did we have to schedule
this the same

14:39.495 --> 14:41.061
day as new westport?

14:41.160 --> 14:42.227
My good news isn't even
going to make

14:42.327 --> 14:43.694
the front of the local section.

14:43.792 --> 14:45.891
- The ribbon-cutting
was scheduled two weeks ago.

14:46.059 --> 14:47.858
This homeless thing
no one saw coming.

14:55.158 --> 14:57.724
- First of all, I'm surprised
to see so much media here.

14:57.824 --> 14:59.558
A press event
held earlier today

14:59.658 --> 15:01.357
to announce the
revitalization of yet

15:01.458 --> 15:03.891
another part of our city
was not so well attended.

15:03.988 --> 15:06.289
It would appear that media
attention is always focusing

15:06.357 --> 15:07.923
on the negatives
when it comes to Baltimore,

15:08.088 --> 15:09.089
but you
guys aren't around

15:09.258 --> 15:10.924
when we're making
real progress.

15:10.990 --> 15:13.057
Nevertheless, I'm glad
to see so many of you here.

15:13.191 --> 15:15.357
Some of you representing
not just our local mia,

15:15.454 --> 15:17.454
but national attention
to this problem.

15:17.555 --> 15:19.188
Thank you for caring
enough about

15:19.323 --> 15:20.988
our most vulnerable
citizens to address

15:21.088 --> 15:22.888
yourselves to this tragedy.

15:22.920 --> 15:25.255
Our homeless citizens,
those who have fallen

15:25.355 --> 15:27.355
through the
cracks of our society,

15:27.452 --> 15:30.918
those who command the least
of our attentions and efforts,

15:31.021 --> 15:34.354
they seemingly have little to
endear themselves to politicians.

15:34.454 --> 15:35.819
They don't vote,
by and large.

15:35.920 --> 15:37.721
They don't contribute
to campaigns.

15:37.819 --> 15:39.554
They offer little
to a city's tax base,

15:39.655 --> 15:41.654
and to the extent that our
government is made aware

15:41.751 --> 15:44.018
of their existence, it responds
by trying to mitigate

15:44.119 --> 15:46.386
the damage
done by their presence.

15:46.487 --> 15:49.186
We open a food bank here,
a shelter there.

15:49.285 --> 15:51.251
We try to move them away
from downtown,

15:51.352 --> 15:54.119
away from our communal
areas, away from our schools,

15:54.284 --> 15:55.549
away from our homes.

15:55.652 --> 15:57.751
If you were to judge our
society by the manner

15:57.817 --> 15:59.220
in which we treat
those lost on our streets,

15:59.317 --> 16:01.850
we would have
cause to be shamed.

16:02.017 --> 16:04.117
Well, I am, God forgive me,
a politician.

16:05.484 --> 16:07.684
But I am also someone who
ran for public office because

16:07.784 --> 16:10.218
I believe that there is a
different way of governing.

16:10.315 --> 16:12.683
And I believe that
in the end we will be judged

16:12.781 --> 16:14.314
not by the efforts
we make on behalf

16:14.415 --> 16:15.582
of those who vote
for us,

16:15.683 --> 16:17.049
or those who contribute
to our campaigns,

16:17.115 --> 16:19.115
or those who provide
for our tax base.

16:19.282 --> 16:21.114
I believe that we will be
judged by what we provide

16:21.216 --> 16:22.949
to the weakest and
most vulnerable.

16:23.049 --> 16:24.383
That is the test.

16:24.480 --> 16:25.846
That is my test.

16:27.114 --> 16:28.914
Somebody is killing
homeless men

16:29.013 --> 16:30.913
in this city.

16:31.045 --> 16:32.748
They are taking the lives
of fellow citizens

16:32.878 --> 16:34.779
who do not have the means
or the strength

16:34.880 --> 16:36.514
to properly protect themselves.

16:36.614 --> 16:37.880
They will be stopped.

16:37.980 --> 16:40.414
We will do everything in
our power to stop them.

16:40.513 --> 16:41.879
You have my word on this.

16:45.777 --> 16:47.312
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

16:47.410 --> 16:48.776
What got into you?

16:48.879 --> 16:49.778
What?

16:49.880 --> 16:50.979
- ...I want to
assure the public

16:51.110 --> 16:53.478
that we are doing
everything possible in our power

16:53.610 --> 16:55.510
to apprehend this subject.

16:55.612 --> 16:57.679
Homicide detectives are
working around the clock.

16:57.777 --> 17:00.310
District officers are in
contact with the agencies

17:00.411 --> 17:02.144
that work with the homeless.

17:02.311 --> 17:04.143
I cannot go into specifics
of the investigation,

17:05.678 --> 17:07.776
but with that caveat,
I will take questions.

17:09.876 --> 17:11.276
- Commissioner,
is there any connection

17:11.441 --> 17:14.275
between these murders and those
in the vacant homes last year?

17:14.340 --> 17:15.340
No conneion.

17:17.441 --> 17:18.973
Commissioner.

17:19.075 --> 17:21.608
Are you asking the F.B.I.
To join in the investigation?

17:21.709 --> 17:23.808
- I think deputy commissioner
Daniels is in a position

17:23.906 --> 17:25.241
to elaborate on that.

17:32.973 --> 17:35.340
- We'll take whatever help
is offered.

17:35.439 --> 17:37.072
Certainly, our detectives
will work closely with

17:37.173 --> 17:39.340
the behavioral analysis
unit at Quantico...

17:39.438 --> 17:42.572
- Deputy, even with all
the resources at your disposal,

17:42.705 --> 17:45.739
isn't it extremely difficult
to catch a serial killer?

17:45.838 --> 17:47.339
- Our ability to
secure genetic material

17:47.438 --> 17:49.538
and the growing
d.N.A. Data bank

17:49.637 --> 17:52.170
are assets unavailable
to us even a few years a.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.005
And our ability to
effectively use resources

17:54.105 --> 17:55.803
has been increased with
the aid of sophisticated

17:55.904 --> 17:57.371
computer software.

17:57.472 --> 17:58.739
And, of course, we have
some of the best criminal

17:58.837 --> 18:01.471
investigators in the nation
working 24/7.

18:01.535 --> 18:04.168
As the mayor made very clear
a moment ago,

18:04.270 --> 18:06.103
this is now a priority
for the department.

18:08.002 --> 18:09.703
- Has a note been found
at any of the scenes?

18:09.800 --> 18:11.368
- I'm not at liberty
to go into any details

18:11.468 --> 18:12.900
of the investigation
at this time.

18:22.301 --> 18:23.534
You want me to hang?

18:39.931 --> 18:42.031
He told you who I am, right?

18:44.930 --> 18:47.864
Son, the thing about murder

18:47.964 --> 18:50.132
is it never goes
off the books.

18:50.230 --> 18:51.764
I mean, we work
on 'em for weeks,

18:51.862 --> 18:53.229
months, years.

18:53.329 --> 18:55.596
We keep on with
it until finally

18:55.664 --> 18:58.397
someone decides
they've had enough,

18:58.496 --> 19:00.663
until we get the right word

19:00.830 --> 19:02.330
from the right person.

19:02.462 --> 19:04.030
And you know what happens then?

19:12.927 --> 19:14.860
When a case does go down...

19:17.026 --> 19:19.494
All those people who kept
quiet about it,

19:19.561 --> 19:21.161
who lied about it,

19:21.261 --> 19:23.695
all of them who thought
it wasn't coming back on 'em,

19:23.825 --> 19:27.692
they end up catchin' a charge.
And they get time behind that.

19:29.026 --> 19:31.059
Time, huh?

19:31.159 --> 19:32.792
You gonna give me time?

19:41.591 --> 19:44.524
- If you know something
about that boy Lex getting shot,

19:44.658 --> 19:46.591
now is your last
chance to speak to that.

19:48.690 --> 19:49.855
You gave a statement
last year...

19:49.958 --> 19:52.157
- Why don't you promise
to get me outta here?

19:53.989 --> 19:55.256
That's what
y'all do, ain't it?

19:55.356 --> 20:01.888
Lie to
dumbass niggers?

20:01.989 --> 20:09.921
Yo, y'all need to get this police
out my face before I bank his ass.

20:09.955 --> 20:17.854
Yo, y'all need to get this police
out my face before I bank his ass.

20:17.988 --> 20:19.520
You're a natural, kiddo.

20:19.622 --> 20:21.321
You had them eating
out of your hand.

20:21.420 --> 20:22.987
Shit, I was justfollowing the mayo

20:23.052 --> 20:24.621
he wants a full-court
press, right?

20:29.819 --> 20:31.286
- We can add a detective
or two.

20:31.387 --> 20:33.386
And you can ask patrol toconcentrate

20:33.519 --> 20:34.885
where vagrants congregate.

20:35.019 --> 20:36.653
But other than that, deputy,
the cupboard is bare.

20:36.751 --> 20:38.018
But Carcetti said...

20:38.085 --> 20:39.018
Make no mistake.

20:39.083 --> 20:41.882
He wants us
to solve the murders.

20:42.018 --> 20:43.553
He just doesn't
want it to cost.

20:44.919 --> 20:46.285
Don't look so shocked.

20:46.385 --> 20:47.985
You're runnin' with
the big dogs now.

20:50.717 --> 20:53.083
Isn't it enough that we're
up on the killer's cellphone?

20:53.183 --> 20:54.450
I would think that you
could track him

20:54.551 --> 20:55.917
on the g.p.s. Chip alone...

20:56.082 --> 20:58.649
- He's using a burner and
we suspect he's taking

20:58.716 --> 21:00.316
out the battery
between calls.

21:00.383 --> 21:02.848
- And there's nothing to
stop him from changing phones,

21:03.017 --> 21:04.917
calling the reporter from
a new number.

21:05.015 --> 21:07.315
- So you want to tap
the reporter's phone as well.

21:07.448 --> 21:09.747
- It stands to reason
that we should monitor

21:09.849 --> 21:11.916
this thing from both ends.

21:12.014 --> 21:12.947
It's what we would normally do.

21:13.081 --> 21:14.915
Nothing about this is normal.

21:15.013 --> 21:16.747
A Baltimore sun reporter's
phone is problematic.

21:16.913 --> 21:19.847
We need to strike a
bance between your needs

21:20.014 --> 21:21.913
as investigators and the
first amendment rights

21:22.014 --> 21:23.714
of the sun and its sources.

21:23.845 --> 21:27.346
- The first amendment does not
guarantee privacy, your honor.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.213
Legal
precedent clearly indicates...

21:29.278 --> 21:30.712
- Look, look, I'm
not saying that we can't, but...

21:30.811 --> 21:31.979
But what?

21:35.411 --> 21:36.845
Until we get the sense

21:36.944 --> 21:40.478
that your suspect
is changing phones,

21:40.578 --> 21:43.944
I'm not inclined to look
with favor on tapping

21:44.044 --> 21:46.744
the Baltimore
sun's telecommunications.

21:46.843 --> 21:47.776
- We're afraid
to piss them off.

21:47.874 --> 21:50.276
- Never pick a fight
with anyone who buys ink

21:50.410 --> 21:52.110
by the barrel-full.

21:52.210 --> 21:53.143
Christ.

21:53.279 --> 21:54.378
Very well, judge.

22:03.575 --> 22:05.307
How many enemies do you need?

22:08.775 --> 22:10.141
Deputy.

22:27.240 --> 22:28.407
Where did you get all this?

22:28.506 --> 22:30.506
- Darling, you do not
want to know.

22:36.338 --> 22:38.605
What's up with you?

22:38.706 --> 22:40.906
- Got all twenty-two out of
the drawer, huh?

22:41.071 --> 22:42.504
Workin' the whole mess at once.

22:42.606 --> 22:43.871
I'm tryi to see 'em fresh.

22:45.538 --> 22:47.337
- Twenty-five.
My triple.

22:47.437 --> 22:49.270
It comes back to
Marlo and his people.

22:49.370 --> 22:50.537
For sure?

22:50.703 --> 22:52.636
A good informant tells me so.

22:52.769 --> 22:54.503
Says one of my vics
was talking bad

22:54.601 --> 22:56.866
about Mr. Stanfield,
who took it personal.

22:56.969 --> 22:58.903
Killed him,
his girl, his muscle.

22:59.003 --> 23:00.802
Left the
little kids alive,

23:00.901 --> 23:02.001
so I guess he ain't all bad.

23:02.135 --> 23:03.969
People out there
so scared of this motherfucker.

23:04.069 --> 23:06.636
I can't get close to an
eyewitness on any of it.

23:09.269 --> 23:10.969
- Where you at with
the rest of these cases?

23:11.067 --> 23:12.334
- You know we don't
even have lab work

23:12.435 --> 23:14.101
on fourteen of these bodies?

23:14.200 --> 23:15.534
A year later
and I'm still walking in written

23:15.635 --> 23:17.102
requests into Landsman,
watching him just file

23:17.201 --> 23:18.468
them away in his drawer.

23:18.566 --> 23:20.466
- McNulty would've called
a news reporter on that shit.

23:20.634 --> 23:22.701
I am not him.

23:22.800 --> 23:26.933
- Well, what would the Bunk do?
Take no for a fucking answer?

23:29.532 --> 23:32.465
- We had cutbacks,
you know that.

23:32.567 --> 23:34.833
We lost three of four
trace examiners.

23:34.930 --> 23:36.364
Lost half our clerical.

23:36.465 --> 23:37.830
The freezer went bad,
we lost four months

23:37.897 --> 23:38.964
of blood samples.

23:39.064 --> 23:40.197
Did you know that?

23:40.330 --> 23:41.829
Four months of evidence
and they still haven't

23:41.896 --> 23:43.829
replaced my damn icebox.

23:43.964 --> 23:46.197
- My heart pumps
purple piss for you.

23:46.329 --> 23:49.229
Now, I got the worst mass
murder in b-more history

23:49.364 --> 23:50.396
and you can't get the
tracework back to me

23:50.497 --> 23:53.198
inside of a year?
C'mon, Ron...

23:53.363 --> 23:55.463
Look...

23:55.562 --> 23:57.262
You can't go to the press.

23:57.363 --> 24:00.362
I mean, heads will
roll if this gets out.

24:00.496 --> 24:01.496
It isn't anyone's fault.

24:01.628 --> 24:04.661
In fact, it's a little
bit on you, in a way.

24:04.762 --> 24:07.029
The fuck you say?

24:07.125 --> 24:09.825
- After annette took
retirement, the casework

24:09.927 --> 24:12.027
got backed up
worse than ever, right?

24:12.127 --> 24:14.127
Well, we put in to fill
the lab assistant slot,

24:14.261 --> 24:15.661
but with all these cutbacks,
the best they could

24:15.827 --> 24:16.761
give us was a temp.

24:16.892 --> 24:19.959
- A temp?
- Yeah. No medical. No pension.

24:20.059 --> 24:23.560
A temp hire to get
us over for a while.

24:23.658 --> 24:25.692
Look, I'll show
you mething...

24:25.794 --> 24:27.560
She was assigned to sort

24:27.660 --> 24:30.393
and file the individual
trace elements...

24:30.490 --> 24:32.057
Hair, fiber mostly...

24:33.856 --> 24:36.957
You know, from each
of the fourteen scenes.

24:38.855 --> 24:39.856
So what's the problem?

24:39.959 --> 24:41.692
- Well, in the
initial paperwork,

24:41.822 --> 24:44.289
you guys wrote out all
twenty-two c.c. Numbers, right?

24:44.326 --> 24:45.292
Right.

24:45.390 --> 24:46.490
- But
in the supplemental requests,

24:46.658 --> 24:49.325
you put all the incidents
under the initial c.c.

24:49.457 --> 24:51.756
And then you wrote,
"et Al," remember?

24:51.855 --> 24:52.955
so?

24:53.056 --> 24:55.424
- She didn't know what
"et Al" meant.

24:55.521 --> 24:58.487
And she sorted everything under
the single complaint number.

24:58.588 --> 25:00.354
- You don't fuckin' mean...
- Yeah.

25:00.421 --> 25:02.421
We have no idea which one
of your scenes

25:02.591 --> 25:04.157
any of this shit came from.

25:05.153 --> 25:06.254
We don't have a clue.

25:12.220 --> 25:14.253
Actually, except for this...

25:14.322 --> 25:21.005
shs
Been a pretty good employee.

25:21.040 --> 25:27.689
She's
been a pretty good employee.

25:27.818 --> 25:29.086
Surveillance teams.

25:29.253 --> 25:30.253
- Two each on
twelveour shifts.

25:30.351 --> 25:31.917
I need them to set
up on certain locations

25:31.984 --> 25:32.984
common to our cases.

25:34.350 --> 25:35.716
C'mon, Jay.

25:35.883 --> 25:36.983
You heard the mayor.
This case is a red ball.

25:37.084 --> 25:37.984
That it is.

25:38.084 --> 25:40.551
You can have Greggs,
if you want.

25:40.616 --> 25:41.583
The last
time I offered her up,

25:41.684 --> 25:43.350
you kicked her
back to her own casework.

25:43.450 --> 25:44.450
Other than a second
detective,

25:44.550 --> 25:45.884
you are on your own.

25:48.882 --> 25:50.615
- So it's all bullshit.
- I dunno.

25:50.714 --> 25:52.714
I thought the mayor
gave a very nice speech.

25:52.816 --> 25:54.083
I, for one, was moved.

25:54.181 --> 25:55.981
Much like the bull to
which you just referred.

26:08.180 --> 26:09.913
- Tell you one thing...
- What's that?

26:10.013 --> 26:11.813
- Motherfucker whose
got the connect,

26:11.913 --> 26:13.280
he the one that did Joe.

26:13.380 --> 26:14.647
Oh, no doubt.

26:31.446 --> 26:33.212
- Y'all know the
co-op took some hits.

26:33.311 --> 26:35.645
Joe. Hungry man.

26:35.743 --> 26:38.212
Good people, especially Joe.

26:38.313 --> 26:40.547
Their passin' was for
real, cold blooded.

26:40.676 --> 26:43.175
I ow what you thinkin',
so I'ma put it out there...

26:45.076 --> 26:46.376
I'm reonsible.

26:48.940 --> 26:50.807
A week or so back,
I made a move on Omar,

26:50.941 --> 26:52.042
with Joe's approval.

26:52.175 --> 26:53.909
The faggot ain't
had heart enough to come at me,

26:54.009 --> 26:55.677
so he come at
those close to me.

26:55.808 --> 26:58.309
Now I'm doublin'
the bounty...

26:58.475 --> 27:01.475
Hundred large for
a whiff of that dicksuck.

27:01.576 --> 27:03.841
Two hundred fifty
for his head.

27:03.941 --> 27:05.575
What about the connect?

27:05.641 --> 27:07.241
I got that covered.

27:07.406 --> 27:09.407
And in light of that fact,
I'm a take it upon

27:09.507 --> 27:10.939
myself to conduct this meet.

27:12.740 --> 27:15.675
Slim, I want you take over
hungry man's slice of the cake.

27:16.939 --> 27:18.772
Meanin' no disrespect,

27:18.873 --> 27:21.040
but I ain't cut
out to be no c.E.o.

27:25.737 --> 27:26.673
Cheese, then.

27:26.771 --> 27:29.038
- No problem, man.
Got you covered.

27:29.139 --> 27:30.737
Until we settle up with Omar,

27:30.838 --> 27:33.672
I think it's
best we suspend these meets.

27:33.771 --> 27:36.104
In fact, I ain't really
one for meets no how.

27:36.204 --> 27:37.870
Anybody got a
problem from here on out,

27:38.036 --> 27:40.169
bring it to me,
or sit on that shit.

27:40.269 --> 27:43.170
Those of you on the westside
who need to re-up,

27:43.269 --> 27:44.901
holla' at my man monk.

27:44.969 --> 27:46.701
He gonna handle
supply over there.

27:46.803 --> 27:48.871
On the eastside, cheese.

27:48.968 --> 27:50.768
One more thing.

27:50.868 --> 27:53.068
Price of the brick going up.

27:53.167 --> 27:54.301
Thirty more.

27:57.601 --> 27:58.700
Alright.
Enough of this shit.

28:14.266 --> 28:15.731
What?

28:15.797 --> 28:18.466
- Next year for the schools.
From now until december,

28:18.631 --> 28:20.364
we're all about the
plight of the homeless.

28:20.467 --> 28:21.733
The great whiting has spoken.

28:21.898 --> 28:23.332
I appealed to klebanow
half hour ago but he gave me

28:23.429 --> 28:25.895
the thumbs down.
I'm sorry.

28:28.998 --> 28:30.897
- Check it out, people.
Our metro desk

28:30.997 --> 28:34.064
has some national profile.

28:34.163 --> 28:35.996
- Uh, we're being
careful to cooperate

28:36.096 --> 28:37.896
with the investigators
in every way.

28:37.997 --> 28:40.164
My newspaper has no desire
to get between

28:40.262 --> 28:41.995
the police and the suspect.

28:42.130 --> 28:43.630
- But still, wouldn't you
agree it's an incredible

28:43.695 --> 28:45.328
moment for any journalist

28:45.428 --> 28:47.461
to come face to face
with that type of pure

28:47.564 --> 28:49.665
evil like the son of Sam.

28:49.761 --> 28:52.927
That makes you the
Jimmy breslin of Baltimore.

28:53.029 --> 28:55.361
- Well, no, I wouldn't
say that. I mean...

28:55.459 --> 28:58.660
- But knowing you have been
in contact with a killer,

28:58.725 --> 29:00.660
are you at all concerned
about continuing to report

29:00.727 --> 29:02.460
from the street?

29:02.561 --> 29:03.893
- No, not at all.
I mean, this is what we do.

29:03.995 --> 29:07.463
As a reporter,
you expect to be

29:07.561 --> 29:09.161
in harm's way
at some points.

29:09.259 --> 29:10.159
It's what we do.

29:10.293 --> 29:11.560
- Agreed.
It's what we do.

29:11.725 --> 29:13.824
But very rarely does a
reporter end up being

29:13.925 --> 29:17.924
in the middle of a story--
An ongoing story--

29:17.991 --> 29:21.091
About a murderer who
is still at large

29:21.192 --> 29:24.594
and posing a severe and
deadly risk to the...

29:24.724 --> 29:27.493
- You shoulda heard
Phelan this morning.

29:27.592 --> 29:29.592
Too scared to tap
the newspaper phones

29:29.723 --> 29:31.291
they might shit
on him for it.

29:32.721 --> 29:34.223
Fuckin' hack judge.

29:34.291 --> 29:35.857
- What would you want with
more wires?

29:35.956 --> 29:36.923
We got all we need.

29:37.088 --> 29:38.088
I don't want another wire.

29:38.190 --> 29:39.856
It's
the principle of the thing...

29:39.922 --> 29:41.658
It just pissed me off
listening to him.

29:43.290 --> 29:46.721
- Oh yeah,
no surveillance cars.

29:46.821 --> 29:49.821
They won't go beyond
me and Greggs.

29:49.923 --> 29:51.590
You and Sydnor will
have to work

29:51.720 --> 29:54.221
it as best
you can for right now.

29:54.321 --> 29:55.855
Assholes.

30:00.884 --> 30:02.485
They need another body,
don't they?

30:05.287 --> 30:07.387
- I'll call our
man in the southern.

30:16.153 --> 30:17.553
- I can take it from here.
Y'all can bounce.

30:17.651 --> 30:18.816
Alright, boss.

30:28.516 --> 30:30.251
What up, Rick?

30:30.350 --> 30:32.049
Just like ol'
times for me and you, huh?

30:32.150 --> 30:33.783
- Whatever you
want it's yours, alright?

30:33.882 --> 30:35.981
- Tonight, I'm just
gonna take yo' jump...

30:38.948 --> 30:40.248
And leave you with
a little something.

30:40.349 --> 30:41.249
What's that?

30:41.350 --> 30:42.850
My word in your ear.

30:42.949 --> 30:46.516
I'm callin'
Marlo a straight bitch.

30:46.614 --> 30:49.881
I'm sayin' it don't take much
to shoot down a blind man.

30:49.982 --> 30:51.582
And as for him
steppin' to me,

30:51.681 --> 30:54.147
you tell that dude
he ain't got the heart.

30:54.247 --> 30:55.346
Alright.

30:55.480 --> 30:58.479
- You tell that man I'm
in the street, waiting.

30:58.581 --> 31:01.648
Anjust like a little bitch,
he ain't nowhere to be found.

31:01.711 --> 31:04.813
- I'll tell him.
I will.

31:04.979 --> 31:06.780
- Pick up your keys
and go on inside, yo.

31:15.545 --> 31:16.711
You kill Joe?

31:16.811 --> 31:18.777
Hungry?

31:21.279 --> 31:22.279
Didn't think so.

31:32.675 --> 31:34.309
What now?

31:35.575 --> 31:37.377
- There's more than
one way to skin a case.

31:49.375 --> 31:51.542
- Already ran
them for priors, right?

31:51.641 --> 31:53.174
Priors, yeah.

31:53.206 --> 31:54.840
But I'm gonna run every name
you guys developed through

31:54.975 --> 31:56.342
the entire database.

31:56.475 --> 31:58.074
Not just for priors,
but for anything at all

31:58.108 --> 31:59.706
in the miles system.

31:59.805 --> 32:02.705
Court appearances,
parole, probation,

32:02.805 --> 32:05.373
gun permits,
d.o.c., open bails.

32:05.474 --> 32:07.040
- You're playing longshots,
huh?

32:07.138 --> 32:10.940
- Darlin', I'm playin'
the hand I've been dealt.

32:11.038 --> 32:12.405
An h-file?

32:18.771 --> 32:21.771
Who caught the case?
- Worden. Other shift.

32:21.838 --> 32:24.405
- Stepfather.
Beaten to death.

32:24.537 --> 32:27.104
They interviewed the mother,
but no one else

32:27.202 --> 32:28.836
in the household.

32:30.203 --> 32:32.136
- Doesn't exactly fit
with the others, does it?

32:32.270 --> 32:33.403
I mean, a straight
up ass-whoopin'

32:33.471 --> 32:35.670
in an alley doesn't seem
like Marlo staield.

32:35.768 --> 32:36.668
No it doesn't.

32:36.837 --> 32:40.904
- But you're
gonna work it anyway.

32:41.069 --> 32:43.203
- In the pentecostal church
where I was given religion,

32:43.299 --> 32:44.933
it would have been
said that the spirit

32:45.034 --> 32:46.567
was on you yesterday.

32:46.667 --> 32:48.500
- It got good to me.
- Let praises be.

32:48.602 --> 32:49.701
- I don't know.
It just pissed me off

32:49.767 --> 32:51.134
that on top of everything
else I gotta deal with,

32:51.234 --> 32:53.034
some nutjob starts
killing homeless guys.

32:53.133 --> 32:55.499
I mean, fuck already,
how many shitbowls are there?

32:55.601 --> 32:57.067
- He's right though.
You were great.

32:57.200 --> 32:59.233
That passion
was just the thing.

33:01.764 --> 33:02.865
You think, uh...

33:02.965 --> 33:04.133
- We step out on this issue,
it could provide

33:04.232 --> 33:05.566
some national presence...

33:05.666 --> 33:07.666
- Didn't the governor
scrap the emergency medical

33:07.765 --> 33:09.965
and housing program last year?

33:10.030 --> 33:11.164
What was it, temha?

33:11.231 --> 33:13.131
- He did, replaced it
with t-dap, which cuts funding

33:13.230 --> 33:14.897
to anyone who doesn't
qualify for federal support.

33:14.998 --> 33:16.531
It's worse than that,
actually: he froze eligibility

33:16.631 --> 33:19.796
by disallowing new applications,
which put all kinda folks

33:19.898 --> 33:21.130
out on the street.

33:21.231 --> 33:23.264
- So we slam the republican
for sticking it to the poor.

33:23.396 --> 33:24.695
It plays.

33:24.797 --> 33:26.963
Nationally, you're ting up
the cause of the forgotten...

33:27.061 --> 33:29.693
And no one is ever in favor
of homelessness...

33:29.863 --> 33:32.130
- Statewide, you're going
up against the fella who tore

33:32.228 --> 33:34.062
up the safety net.

33:34.163 --> 33:35.796
Homelessness.

33:39.530 --> 33:41.029
I'll be damned.

33:49.726 --> 33:52.994
- Base to twenty-three-oh-six.
- Go ahead, Lester.

33:53.094 --> 33:55.160
- You see anybody using
a cellphone?

33:55.259 --> 33:56.360
Wait one.

33:57.827 --> 33:59.060
Negative.

34:00.058 --> 34:01.459
Hold on.

34:01.558 --> 34:02.824
Somebody's here.

34:04.789 --> 34:06.090
Lester...

34:12.725 --> 34:16.092
Can't get used to how empty
this place feels nowadays.

34:16.225 --> 34:18.358
- True, but you'd be
surprised what you can get done

34:18.458 --> 34:20.623
when no one's looking
over your shoulder.

34:20.757 --> 34:24.024
- You'll need to serve
these. Running out of time.

34:24.123 --> 34:26.391
- I'll get right on it.
- There's a couple of loose ends

34:26.458 --> 34:27.626
I think we should
cover as well.

34:27.722 --> 34:29.556
- Now?
- If not now, when?

34:29.656 --> 34:31.755
The trial date is
coming up on us fast.

34:31.889 --> 34:33.623
- Right.
But it's uh...

34:36.087 --> 34:39.387
- Is it something I said?
- No...

34:39.554 --> 34:44.920
It's, Sydnor is bringing
in a C.I. And if you're here...

34:45.021 --> 34:47.020
Oh, shit.

34:47.087 --> 34:48.554
I'm sorry. Um...

34:50.453 --> 34:52.185
I'll leave you
my list, okay?

34:52.286 --> 34:54.587
- No problem.
We'll get right on it.

34:54.686 --> 34:56.386
I'm sorry, Lester,

34:56.485 --> 34:58.920
if I was intruding.

34:59.019 --> 35:00.052
You couldn't know.

35:06.452 --> 35:07.851
So why you here?

35:09.050 --> 35:10.583
If this about Michael
an' what he into,

35:10.682 --> 35:13.583
y'all should know he don't
live here no more.

35:13.649 --> 35:16.217
- Actually, I'm following
up on your man's case.

35:16.384 --> 35:19.117
You spoke to detective
worden when it happened.

35:19.217 --> 35:20.583
Hmm?

35:23.649 --> 35:25.483
He was your boyfriend,
right?

35:25.583 --> 35:26.983
When he weren't in jail...

35:28.315 --> 35:29.416
Father to my youngest.

35:32.883 --> 35:34.517
But you know how he died.

35:34.617 --> 35:36.317
Beaten bad.

35:36.416 --> 35:39.049
Crime of passion, as we say.

35:39.147 --> 35:41.779
Didn't seem like
he was home long enough

35:41.881 --> 35:44.680
to get somebody
that riled at him.

35:44.847 --> 35:46.780
Unless, of course,
it was over you.

35:46.880 --> 35:48.847
- What, you sayin'
I know somethin' about that?

35:48.881 --> 35:50.679
- Lady, let's put our cards
on the table.

35:50.780 --> 35:53.147
I been in this game
longer than a little bit,

35:53.248 --> 35:54.780
and there's one
thing I know from jump.

35:54.879 --> 35:56.146
You get a murder like this,

35:56.245 --> 35:58.411
there's bound to be a woman
at the center of it.

35:58.579 --> 35:59.945
I don't know nothin'.

36:01.447 --> 36:03.080
- You know my gut
tells me that you do.

36:05.345 --> 36:06.613
And I'll tell you what...

36:07.879 --> 36:09.179
We're gonna
take a ride downtown,

36:09.344 --> 36:10.777
let you talk
to the grand jury.

36:10.878 --> 36:12.044
You're n
straight with them,

36:12.143 --> 36:13.876
they'll slap you with
a material witness warrant.

36:13.978 --> 36:15.245
And you sit
over at woman's

36:15.344 --> 36:17.710
detention for
a couple of weeks.

36:17.810 --> 36:21.010
It's amazing what it does
for the grieving process.

36:21.108 --> 36:23.108
Get your things.
- I ain't goin' no damn where.

36:23.244 --> 36:24.677
It's me or the wagon.

36:27.309 --> 36:29.176
- Detective, I swear,
I ain't in this.

36:30.242 --> 36:32.175
It ain't me you wanna talk to.

36:34.441 --> 36:36.840
It's the boy,
he know.

36:36.942 --> 36:38.375
He runnin' with
them who did it.

36:38.474 --> 36:39.940
- You just tryin' to put me
off the scent here.

36:40.109 --> 36:41.941
No, you gotta believe me.

36:46.205 --> 36:48.105
He told me devar
wasn't comin' home,

36:48.274 --> 36:50.907
'fore we even
knowed he was dead.

36:52.439 --> 36:53.439
- U said he's runnin'
with them?

36:53.542 --> 36:54.807
Runnin' with who?

36:54.937 --> 36:56.506
- Chris, Snoop,
all them gangsters.

36:56.606 --> 37:04.505
Who else doin'
all the killin' around here?

37:04.669 --> 37:06.237
Let me see your camera.

37:11.703 --> 37:13.371
- Add a minute-six
to your times.

37:13.471 --> 37:14.704
Got it.

37:14.803 --> 37:16.070
Here it is. Look at this.

37:17.470 --> 37:21.337
Single ring.
Connection. Silence.

37:21.435 --> 37:23.168
What do you have?

37:23.269 --> 37:25.735
- I took these three.
They're just hangin' around.

37:33.001 --> 37:34.733
What time did monk leave?

37:36.068 --> 37:38.534
One twenty-four.
Two minutes later.

37:45.031 --> 37:48.467
- It's not what Marlo's
sayin', it's what he's sendin'.

37:48.565 --> 37:49.732
Look at monk.

37:49.832 --> 37:51.400
- Yeah.
Text message.

37:51.533 --> 37:53.899
- Text?
Need I remind you, detective,

37:54.000 --> 37:57.633
these young men are products
of Baltimore city schools.

37:57.732 --> 37:59.798
Besides, look how far away
he's holding his phone.

37:59.897 --> 38:01.830
Too far away to
be reading a text.

38:01.931 --> 38:04.432
Naw, son. Pictures.

38:06.996 --> 38:08.464
Pictures...

38:43.494 --> 38:46.226
- What the fuck
you lookin' at?

38:46.361 --> 38:48.860
- You know what
they do, right? They tease you.

38:48.958 --> 38:52.424
They let you get close and
just when you're about to

38:52.527 --> 38:55.594
pull the case, they rip the
fuckin' rug out from under you.

38:57.158 --> 38:58.957
I'm not lying.
We got a fuckin' serial

38:59.059 --> 39:01.126
killer on the loose.

39:03.791 --> 39:05.225
You didn't know that?

39:06.590 --> 39:08.789
It's in the goddamn paper.

39:14.055 --> 39:16.589
What support do I get?
One fuckin' detective.

39:18.490 --> 39:20.490
They wanna play their
simple-ass games, fine.

39:20.688 --> 39:21.988
But I gotta do what I gotta do.

39:22.087 --> 39:24.254
'scuse me.

39:27.056 --> 39:28.056
McNulty.

39:28.155 --> 39:29.255
Yeah, Oscar.

39:30.454 --> 39:31.687
Beautiful.

39:33.787 --> 39:36.087
Absolutely. Where?
On my way.

40:05.184 --> 40:10.183
- Man, you can't let it get
to you like this.

40:10.283 --> 40:11.883
Why don't we go
buy up a bunch of

40:11.982 --> 40:14.150
toys and take
'em to your kids?

40:14.247 --> 40:15.348
You ain't hearin' me.

40:15.449 --> 40:17.615
How can I go near my people
with Omar on us?

40:17.716 --> 40:19.549
- How he gonna find
out about them?

40:19.650 --> 40:21.983
- How we find out
about the blind man?

40:53.445 --> 40:55.011
Omar, yo, Omar!

40:55.113 --> 40:56.644
Hey yo, Omar!

40:56.746 --> 40:57.645
Get.

40:57.743 --> 40:58.742
Omar!

40:58.844 --> 41:00.211
It's Omar!

41:07.511 --> 41:08.644
You too, shorty.

41:12.942 --> 41:14.842
- Omar!
It's Omar!

41:14.943 --> 41:16.310
Money a little late today.

41:29.640 --> 41:31.274
That buckshot in your leg
should help you some you

41:31.407 --> 41:33.706
explain' yourself to Marlo.

41:33.774 --> 41:34.941
As for them other two

41:35.073 --> 41:36.606
they gonna wish
that I'd peppered them a bit.

41:41.206 --> 41:44.772
Now you make sure you tell
old Marlo I burned the money.

41:44.872 --> 41:46.573
'cause it ain't
about that paper.

41:46.673 --> 41:49.773
It's about me hurtin' his
people, messin' with his world.

41:49.870 --> 41:52.404
Tell that boy he ain't man
enough to come down

41:52.505 --> 41:54.071
to the street with Omar.

41:55.137 --> 41:56.604
You tell him that!

42:04.869 --> 42:07.203
- My sergeant and two side
partners got here before me.

42:07.303 --> 42:08.436
Then the
shift commander showed.

42:08.603 --> 42:10.603
Now the duty
officer is on his way.

42:10.635 --> 42:11.902
For a d.o.a.?

42:12.002 --> 42:15.338
- Yeah, well, you and Lester
started some shit here, son.

42:15.436 --> 42:29.469
Now a d.o.a. Call
brings everyone in a heartbeat.

43:08.061 --> 43:09.361
God bless.

43:20.027 --> 43:21.396
Pictures?

43:21.496 --> 43:24.396
Photographs on cellphones.

43:24.462 --> 43:27.727
Now that means new p.c.
To capture the photos,

43:27.826 --> 43:29.560
and new equipment
that could do it.

43:31.827 --> 43:35.126
- How do I write that into my
bullshit homeless killer's m.o.?

43:37.091 --> 43:38.624
When we started this,

43:38.723 --> 43:40.623
you said all we
needed were some bugs,

43:40.727 --> 43:43.261
a camera or two,
and in a couple of weeks,

43:43.393 --> 43:44.825
we'd have them.
That's what you said.

43:46.093 --> 43:48.226
So I cranked up my
bullshit to pay for that,

43:48.325 --> 43:50.825
but no, then you
needed a wiretap.

43:50.924 --> 43:52.758
So I went along with that,
I got you the wiretap.

43:52.856 --> 43:55.057
Then you ask for
surveillance teams,

43:55.124 --> 43:57.324
but before I can get to
that, you came to me with this.

43:57.425 --> 43:59.560
I mean, what the fuck?

44:02.491 --> 44:04.690
I gotta tell you, Lester,

44:04.823 --> 44:06.022
I don't
want to hurt your feelings,

44:06.124 --> 44:08.757
but I can see why Daniels
cringed every time you opened

44:08.854 --> 44:11.821
your fucking mouth.
You're a supervisor's nightmare.

44:11.921 --> 44:13.755
I'm just following the thread.

44:28.520 --> 44:30.519
- Okay, say we get you
the intercept on your pictures,

44:30.619 --> 44:32.253
will that give us Marlo?

44:32.319 --> 44:35.152
- It'll be coded,
probably,

44:35.252 --> 44:36.618
but I'm sure
we can break it.

44:36.785 --> 44:38.519
That'll tell us how they
do business,

44:38.618 --> 44:42.952
and usually, that's
enough. Or not.

44:43.052 --> 44:46.152
But the truth is, I'm running
Sydnor ragged just staying

44:46.253 --> 44:47.386
on a couple of mopes and
monitoring calls.

44:47.518 --> 44:49.883
Now, when
we're up on their code,

44:50.019 --> 44:51.219
we're going
to need more manpower

44:51.385 --> 44:52.884
to run down
a stash or a re-up.

44:53.050 --> 44:54.150
We can't do it all.

44:54.216 --> 44:56.882
- I can't juke
this thing any more than I have.

44:56.982 --> 44:59.417
Last night, half the police
department turned up

44:59.551 --> 45:02.185
at Oscar's crime scene
before I could get there.

45:04.616 --> 45:06.049
We can't make another murder.

45:16.249 --> 45:18.450
Thanks for the milk.

45:18.579 --> 45:20.082
What's a donut without milk?

45:23.649 --> 45:25.781
- So you were
talking about

45:25.878 --> 45:27.345
your second tour...

45:27.447 --> 45:30.480
The bad one, yeah.

45:30.545 --> 45:32.279
Second tour fucked me up good.

45:32.379 --> 45:35.111
But they don't wanna hear it.
- Who doesn't?

45:35.179 --> 45:38.379
- Mostly, it's command and
the Senior E.m.s.

45:38.447 --> 45:40.878
Put it down that marines
don't get p.t.s.d.

45:40.978 --> 45:42.279
But they do.

45:43.278 --> 45:44.511
Can you tell me what happened?

45:50.011 --> 45:51.977
Terry, can you talk about it?

45:53.911 --> 45:55.278
- We had a month
left on the tour,

45:55.377 --> 45:58.511
working an s-and-a mission
outside fallujah.

45:58.609 --> 46:01.310
I was assistant team leader.

46:01.477 --> 46:04.376
Our m-niner, niner, eights were
retritted with up-armor kits.

46:04.475 --> 46:06.307
M-niner-niner-eight?

46:06.407 --> 46:09.108
A humvee, sorry.

46:09.208 --> 46:10.574
They're big on nomenclature.

46:12.641 --> 46:15.374
Anyway we finished our
sweep, headed back in, right?

46:15.475 --> 46:18.574
It was all good.
Then, bam...

46:18.673 --> 46:21.940
Our lead vehicle was hit
with an elevated I.E.d.

46:22.073 --> 46:24.307
The blast
tore the m-fifty gunner in half.

46:24.440 --> 46:26.740
Flipped the humvee
like a matchbox car.

46:26.841 --> 46:28.274
Driver lost both his hands.

46:28.373 --> 46:30.906
Blood shooting out
all over. He's fuckin' laughin',

46:31.006 --> 46:34.373
saying over and over,
"look, ma, no hands."

46:40.770 --> 46:43.405
It's the laughing
I can't shake.

46:44.604 --> 46:46.137
Weird.

46:46.238 --> 46:48.570
'cause he's okay, you know?
I mean, he's better than me.

46:50.570 --> 46:52.404
Got himself a couple
of prosthetic mitts,

46:52.569 --> 46:53.936
eighty thousand apiece.

46:58.302 --> 46:59.371
Wow.

47:04.835 --> 47:08.436
What happened next?
- Nothing really.

47:08.538 --> 47:10.703
We pushed out,
secured the perimeter.

47:10.801 --> 47:13.067
Corpsman did what he could,
an' we waited for the cas-evac.

48:03.428 --> 48:05.860
- Look, I'm not looking
to shit on another guy's copy,

48:05.960 --> 48:07.529
I just wanted to
let you know this was out there.

48:07.628 --> 48:09.996
I'm at a community meeting
in bel air-edison to hear about

48:10.127 --> 48:13.528
school zoning and this woman
talked my ear off about this.

48:13.627 --> 48:14.994
She said the kids
never saw a dime.

48:15.094 --> 48:16.394
Hmm.

48:17.927 --> 48:20.460
- I mean, I'm hoping
this is all bullshit.

48:21.925 --> 48:22.825
- Hey, Scott.
How's it coming?

48:22.926 --> 48:23.926
- Prettyood.
You seen the art?

48:24.028 --> 48:25.295
- Yeah, yeah.
Good stuff, good stuff.

48:25.360 --> 48:27.461
Listen, we got a complaint
about a story you wrote

48:27.559 --> 48:28.826
a couple weeks ago.

48:28.924 --> 48:29.991
The one about the woman

48:30.091 --> 48:31.791
who died from an
allergic reaction to seafood,

48:31.892 --> 48:33.159
you remember?
- What about it?

48:33.291 --> 48:34.426
- Neighborhood ladknows
the dead woman's sister says

48:34.527 --> 48:37.060
our story made a lot of
money for those kids,

48:37.156 --> 48:38.057
a scholarship
fund we wrote up.

48:38.190 --> 48:39.358
- Yeah?
So...

48:39.457 --> 48:42.058
- Well, she says the
sister has a history of fraud,

48:42.157 --> 48:43.623
convictions on it.

48:43.723 --> 48:45.357
She says all the money went
to atlantic city casinos

48:45.457 --> 48:47.524
and kids never saw a dime.

48:47.657 --> 48:49.757
- Christ, who the fuck...
- I know, I know.

48:49.855 --> 48:51.122
It's probably some old biddy
talkin' about stuff

48:51.291 --> 48:52.458
she don't know,

48:52.556 --> 48:54.856
but maybe you should go
back and check with the family,

48:55.022 --> 49:02.089
see if we don't get took
on this, huh?

49:02.287 --> 49:05.454
- No, no. Not now.
After you file.

49:05.553 --> 49:06.920
Just make a couple calls, huh?

49:14.553 --> 49:15.920
This is kidnapping.

49:16.020 --> 49:18.187
- Actually, I'm not sure.
I asked him if he wanted

49:20.020 --> 49:22.154
and talk and
he walked to my car.

49:22.285 --> 49:23.485
You give him the hundred?

49:24.852 --> 49:26.287
Stuffed it in his jacket.

49:28.917 --> 49:30.484
He's fine, Lester.
He's great.

49:31.852 --> 49:33.052
- Think he'll find his way
back home?

49:33.154 --> 49:35.053
Eventually.

49:35.153 --> 49:36.785
By then, we'll be done with
Marlo, we'll have shut

49:36.951 --> 49:38.584
this thing down.
And as far as what happened

49:38.683 --> 49:41.051
to this guy...

49:41.218 --> 49:44.419
They'll write
it off as some fraternity prank.

49:44.550 --> 49:47.685
- Does he know we're cops?
- No.

49:47.784 --> 49:49.651
- And even if he figures it out,
who's gonna believe him?

49:49.750 --> 49:51.218
He's nuts.
- How do you know he's nuts?

49:51.317 --> 49:53.117
- First of all,
just look at him.

49:53.217 --> 49:55.151
He's fucking bouncing
off the walls.

49:55.249 --> 49:57.149
Second of all...
I got his scrip.

49:57.248 --> 50:00.415
I called the university E.r.
It's an anti-psychotic.

50:00.516 --> 50:02.516
So...

50:02.613 --> 50:04.580
I took his I.D., I'll

50:04.681 --> 50:07.214
scratch his
name off the scrip

50:07.349 --> 50:09.481
and leave him with this...

50:09.581 --> 50:12.748
I got that one from E first
homeless death Oscar gave us.

50:12.844 --> 50:14.978
The one that was too rigored.
Donald somebody or other.

50:15.047 --> 50:18.679
It had him in a cleveland,
ohio shelter.

50:18.779 --> 50:22.414
- McNulty, you are deserving
of serious psychological study.

50:22.514 --> 50:24.979
- You need p.c.
To intercept cellphone photos.

50:25.114 --> 50:26.415
Well here it is, right here.

50:26.578 --> 50:29.012
We send photos of this guy

50:29.145 --> 50:31.078
all ribboned up
from a dry cellphone

50:31.177 --> 50:33.643
to that goofy reporter,
along with a message

50:33.779 --> 50:36.079
bitching about his stories.
"I ain't no pervert,"

50:36.176 --> 50:38.077
or whatever.
Now, the killer says,

50:38.178 --> 50:39.644
you ain't gonna find
no more bodies.

50:39.778 --> 50:41.811
Only photos of the victims...

50:41.910 --> 50:43.277
Before they disappear.

50:48.343 --> 50:50.044
Look at this poor sucker.
I don't believe we're

50:50.144 --> 50:51.543
gonna do this.

50:51.675 --> 50:53.810
- He disappears,
the city goes batshit.

50:53.907 --> 50:55.242
You get your photo intercepts,

50:55.344 --> 50:57.044
d by the time we need to
run down one of Marlo's re-ups,

50:57.175 --> 50:59.442
you got all the
manpower you need.

50:59.541 --> 51:02.574
- And Marlo falls.
- Falls hard.

51:24.604 --> 51:28.004
- Don't fucking tell me
you mislabeled ts too.

51:28.103 --> 51:31.471
I want comparisons between
known suspects

51:31.537 --> 51:34.370
and the d.N.A. From this scene.
By the looks of it,

51:34.439 --> 51:36.204
we got a whole
lot of d.N.A. Outta this mess.

51:37.668 --> 51:39.470
Now, motherfucker. Right now.

51:39.568 --> 51:41.769
- Top of my list.
As soon as we work through

51:41.902 --> 51:43.770
all the trace from the
homeless killings.

51:45.736 --> 51:46.937
That's the priority, Bunk.

51:49.203 --> 51:51.103
- The homeless killings.
- Everything is backed up

51:51.136 --> 51:53.468
behind that, sorry.

51:53.570 --> 51:56.271
Your boy McNulty has
everyone's attention right now.

52:12.899 --> 52:14.432
So it's Larry, huh?

52:16.967 --> 52:18.901
Okay, Larry.
You're witgood people here.

52:19.034 --> 52:20.502
It's all gonna be great.

52:23.865 --> 52:27.232
You're gonna like this place.
It's warm, they got nice beds.

52:29.332 --> 52:31.065
And best of all, I gave you
cash money just for

52:31.164 --> 52:32.896
walking in the door.

52:38.097 --> 52:39.531
Come on, Larry.

52:41.995 --> 52:43.962
It's goin' to be fine.
I promise.

52:53.728 --> 52:56.461
- You feel up for trying
Clay yourself?

52:56.595 --> 52:58.261
I mean, it's been
a while since

52:58.360 --> 53:00.593
you tried
a criminal case personally.

53:00.694 --> 53:02.428
It sends a statement, I think.

53:02.528 --> 53:04.461
We should start with our
witness list.

53:04.595 --> 53:06.462
See if we can pare that down
any, out of respect for

53:06.558 --> 53:08.760
the distracted nature
of a Baltimore jury.

53:08.893 --> 53:12.760
- First, there's something
else I need to bring up.

53:18.923 --> 53:21.190
- Old grand jury stuff?
- Sealed indictments.

53:21.292 --> 53:24.558
Sealed transcripts.
Dozens of them.

53:24.657 --> 53:26.558
Pulled from the desk
of a shot-to-death drug

53:26.657 --> 53:28.258
dealer in east Baltimore.

53:29.259 --> 53:31.460
The deputy ops
brought me those.

53:31.556 --> 53:33.157
We have a leak.

53:55.955 --> 53:59.022
- And he showed up,
outside where I work.

53:59.122 --> 54:02.754
He was confused. Lost
I think. So I brought him here.

54:02.854 --> 54:04.920
Donald, where you fr?

54:09.853 --> 54:11.653
Tell the lady, Donald.

54:15.619 --> 54:17.252
Baltimore.

54:17.386 --> 54:21.785
- But he told me he came
from cleveland.

54:21.951 --> 54:34.367
- Donald,
do you have identification?

54:34.399 --> 54:46.781
- Donald,
do you have identification?

54:46.882 --> 54:48.315
This does say cleveland.

54:50.181 --> 54:57.581
Donald, why don't
we get you something to eat?

54:57.679 --> 54:58.979
It's okay. Come on.

55:02.711 --> 55:04.445
We're good to go?

55:04.513 --> 55:06.514
It's great, Gus.

55:06.613 --> 55:08.947
It sings.

55:09.045 --> 55:10.712
- Hey, scottie boy.
- Hey.

55:10.846 --> 55:13.346
- Hey. Great piece.
I mean this one really feels

55:13.413 --> 55:15.313
like the real deal.
- It's great work.

55:15.412 --> 55:16.778
Thanks.

55:16.878 --> 55:19.379
- What I like most about it
is that you didn't overwrite it.

55:19.543 --> 55:21.278
No extra color.
No puffy adjectives.

55:21.380 --> 55:23.913
Just
tight, declarative sentences.

55:24.011 --> 55:26.178
And you really let this
ex-marine just tell his story.

55:26.343 --> 55:29.276
- Thanks, Gus.
- Hey, Mr. Slot man,

55:29.444 --> 55:33.342
read it and weep.
And I mean that literally.

55:33.510 --> 55:34.910
Oh, hey, Scott.

55:35.010 --> 55:36.276
Did you get
a chance to, uh,

55:36.375 --> 55:37.707
drop a
couple calls on that complaint?

55:37.809 --> 55:38.709
Yeah, it's bullshit.

55:38.808 --> 55:40.344
I talked to people
in the neighborhood.

55:40.509 --> 55:43.509
Sister's good people, but
there's another woman,

55:43.609 --> 55:45.908
up there, unrelated,
keeps getting arrested

55:46.009 --> 55:48.608
for kiting checks
and stuff, and she...

55:48.709 --> 55:51.542
She uses the sister's name
every time she gets locked up.

55:51.707 --> 55:53.175
She's done it like
three or four times now.

55:53.275 --> 55:54.842
- No shit.
- Yeah, it's crazy.

55:55.008 --> 55:56.843
But sister's clean.
Everyone says so.

55:57.906 --> 55:59.007
Okay.

56:37.735 --> 56:39.302
- Is there anything else
I can do for him?

56:39.402 --> 56:42.135
- No, we've got it.
But thanks for bringing him in.

56:42.202 --> 56:44.301
Most people, they just
ignore them.

56:54.401 --> 56:56.468
I just want to get all of
your paperwork taken care of...
