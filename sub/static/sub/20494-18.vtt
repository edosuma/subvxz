00:07.999 --> 00:07.999
 Lemonis:

00:07.999 --> 00:07.999
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

00:08.999 --> 00:10.999
TONIGHT, ON "THE PROFIT"...

00:10.999 --> 00:12.999
-Richard: WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:10.999 --> 00:12.999
-Lemonis: OH, MY GOSH.

00:12.999 --> 00:14.999
...A PROGRESS REPORT.

00:14.999 --> 00:16.999
THIS PLACE LOOKS GREAT.

00:16.999 --> 00:20.999
OVER THE PAST 18 MONTHS,

00:16.999 --> 00:20.999
I'VE TRAVELED THE COUNTRY,

00:20.999 --> 00:23.999
TRYING TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES,

00:20.999 --> 00:23.999
EVERYTHING FROM PIE SHOPS

00:24.000 --> 00:25.999
TO USED-CAR LOTS...

00:26.000 --> 00:27.999
WOW. LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

00:27.999 --> 00:29.000
...TO CLOTHING STORES.

00:29.999 --> 00:32.999
SOME WERE

00:29.999 --> 00:32.999
IN DESPERATE SITUATIONS.

00:32.999 --> 00:34.999
Michael: [ Voice breaking ]

00:32.999 --> 00:34.999
DO YOU THINK I LIKE TO STAND

00:32.999 --> 00:34.999
NEXT TO A MAN LIKE YOU

00:34.999 --> 00:37.999
AND ADMIT

00:34.999 --> 00:37.999
THAT I CAN'T BE SUCCESSFUL?

00:37.999 --> 00:38.999
[ SIGHS ]

00:38.999 --> 00:39.999
Lemonis: OTHERS

00:38.999 --> 00:39.999
JUST NEEDED SOME GUIDANCE.

00:39.999 --> 00:42.999
COME ON. YOU'RE A SMART GUY.

00:39.999 --> 00:42.999
YOU DO THE MATH.

00:42.999 --> 00:46.999
AND I OFFERED MY MONEY

00:42.999 --> 00:46.999
AND MY EXPERTISE

00:46.999 --> 00:48.999
FOR A STAKE IN THE BUSINESS.

00:48.999 --> 00:49.999
-DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

00:48.999 --> 00:49.999
-Hank: DEAL.

00:49.999 --> 00:50.999
-Pete: YES.

00:49.999 --> 00:50.999
-Alan: YES.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.999
Lemonis:

00:51.000 --> 00:52.999
A FEW OF THE DEALS WENT SOUTH.

00:52.999 --> 00:54.999
YOU DON'T HOW TO TREAT PEOPLE.

00:54.999 --> 00:55.999
-Andrew: OH, YEAH, I DO.

00:54.999 --> 00:55.999
-Lemonis: NO.

00:55.999 --> 00:58.999
BUT TODAY, I'M A PROUD PARTNER

00:55.999 --> 00:58.999
IN OVER A DOZEN COMPANIES.

00:58.999 --> 01:00.999
-Stephanie: WHOO!

00:58.999 --> 01:00.999
-Lemonis: TONIGHT,

01:00.999 --> 01:02.999
I'M GONNA TELL

01:00.999 --> 01:02.999
YOU HOW THEY DO IT --

01:02.999 --> 01:05.999
MY BEST DEALS, MY WORST DEALS.

01:05.999 --> 01:07.999
Steve:

01:05.999 --> 01:07.999
I'D RATHER BE IN MORE DEBT THAN

01:05.999 --> 01:07.999
HAVE YOU RUNNING MY COMPANY.

01:07.999 --> 01:12.999
Lemonis: THIS IS "THE PROFIT" --

01:07.999 --> 01:12.999
A PROGRESS REPORT.

01:17.999 --> 01:20.999
MY NAME IS MARCUS LEMONIS.

01:20.999 --> 01:21.999
CHANGE IS DIFFICULT.

01:21.999 --> 01:23.999
AND OVER THE LAST 18 MONTHS,

01:23.999 --> 01:27.999
I'VE INTRODUCED YOU TO 23 SMALL

01:23.999 --> 01:27.999
BUSINESSES ACROSS THIS COUNTRY,

01:27.999 --> 01:29.999
MANY OF THEM

01:27.999 --> 01:29.999
IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE.

01:29.999 --> 01:30.999
THIS IS A BAD SCENARIO.

01:30.999 --> 01:33.000
Woman: WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY

01:30.999 --> 01:33.000
TO PAY THEM.

01:33.999 --> 01:34.999
Larissa: JUST EVERYTHING --

01:33.999 --> 01:34.999
ALL THE BILLS

01:34.999 --> 01:36.999
AND EVERYTHING

01:34.999 --> 01:36.999
THAT'S JUST BEEN PILING UP.

01:36.999 --> 01:37.999
IT'S JUST SO MUCH.

01:39.999 --> 01:40.999
Lemonis: THAT'S FINE.

01:40.999 --> 01:42.999
AND I FIX FAILING BUSINESSES.

01:42.999 --> 01:43.999
IT'S BEEN

01:42.999 --> 01:43.999
AN INTERESTING JOURNEY...

01:43.999 --> 01:45.999
WELL, THIS LOOKS

01:43.999 --> 01:45.999
A LOT BETTER IN HERE.

01:45.999 --> 01:46.999
...A TOUGH ONE.

01:46.999 --> 01:49.999
-I TOOK YOU AT YOUR WORD!

01:46.999 --> 01:49.999
-Gary: BULL[BLEEP]

01:49.999 --> 01:52.999
Lemonis:

01:49.999 --> 01:52.999
'CAUSE WHEN EACH EPISODE ENDS,

01:49.999 --> 01:52.999
MY WORK IS JUST BEGINNING.

01:52.999 --> 01:53.999
THERE YOU GO.

01:53.999 --> 01:55.999
TO DATE,

01:55.999 --> 01:58.999
I'VE INVESTED ALMOST $20 MILLION

01:55.999 --> 01:58.999
OF MY OWN MONEY

01:58.999 --> 02:00.999
TO HELP THESE SMALL BUSINESSES

01:58.999 --> 02:00.999
REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL.

02:00.999 --> 02:02.999
Stephanie: WOW.

02:00.999 --> 02:02.999
I MEAN, I'M BLOWN AWAY.

02:02.999 --> 02:05.999
Lemonis: ALONG THE WAY,

02:02.999 --> 02:05.999
I'VE TAKEN A FEW HITS.

02:05.999 --> 02:07.999
YOU KIND OF [BLEEP] ME

02:05.999 --> 02:07.999
ALL ALONG THE WAY.

02:07.999 --> 02:10.999
BUT THE REAL STORY HERE

02:10.999 --> 02:13.999
IS THAT MANY OF THESE COMPANIES

02:10.999 --> 02:13.999
HAVE REALLY FLOURISHED.

02:13.999 --> 02:16.999
-Child: I WANTED VANILLA.

02:13.999 --> 02:16.999
-Woman: VANILLA?

02:16.999 --> 02:20.999
Lemonis: I'VE ALWAYS LOVED

02:16.999 --> 02:20.999
CANDY, AND EARLIER THIS YEAR,

02:20.999 --> 02:22.999
I WENT TO JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA,

02:20.999 --> 02:22.999
AND I MET ANOTHER SWEET TOOTH,

02:22.999 --> 02:26.999
MASTER CHOCOLATIER

02:22.999 --> 02:26.999
PETER BEHRINGER...

02:26.999 --> 02:27.999
Lemonis:

02:26.999 --> 02:27.999
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE A MAD

02:26.999 --> 02:27.999
SCIENTIST WITH THAT LAB COAT.

02:27.999 --> 02:29.999
Peter: I GUESS

02:27.999 --> 02:29.999
YOU COULD SAY I AM.

02:29.999 --> 02:31.999
Lemonis:

02:29.999 --> 02:31.999
...WHO OPENED UP SWEET PETE'S,

02:31.999 --> 02:34.999
A CANDY STORE WITH A SMALL

02:31.999 --> 02:34.999
MAIL-ORDER BUSINESS, IN 2010.

02:34.999 --> 02:37.999
Peter: IT'S THE MOST AWESOME

02:34.999 --> 02:37.999
BUSINESS THERE IS.

02:37.999 --> 02:38.999
IT BRINGS JOY TO MY LIFE.

02:38.999 --> 02:41.999
Lemonis: WHEN I FIRST MET PETE

02:38.999 --> 02:41.999
AND HIS WIFE, ALLISON,

02:41.999 --> 02:44.999
THEIR COMPANY WAS GENERATING

02:41.999 --> 02:44.999
$400,000 IN SALES

02:44.999 --> 02:47.999
BUT STILL POSTING

02:44.999 --> 02:47.999
A $17,000 LOSS,

02:47.999 --> 02:49.999
AND IT WASN'T HARD TO SEE WHY.

02:49.999 --> 02:50.999
THEIR STORE WAS A SMALL HOUSE.

02:50.999 --> 02:52.999
IT'S IN A RESIDENTIAL LOCATION

02:52.999 --> 02:56.999
WITH NO FOOT TRAFFIC

02:52.999 --> 02:56.999
AND NOT A LOT OF BUSINESS.

02:56.999 --> 02:57.999
-CAN I SEE THE KITCHEN?

02:56.999 --> 02:57.999
-Peter: THIS IS IT.

02:57.999 --> 02:59.999
Lemonis:

02:57.999 --> 02:59.999
AND THE KITCHEN, IT WAS SMALL --

02:59.999 --> 03:00.999
LESS THAN 150 SQUARE FEET.

03:00.999 --> 03:02.999
AND THE EQUIPMENT --

03:02.999 --> 03:04.999
WELL, IT WAS BETTER SUITED

03:02.999 --> 03:04.999
TO BAKE A COUPLE CAKES

03:04.999 --> 03:06.999
RATHER THAN MAKING PRODUCT

03:04.999 --> 03:06.999
FOR A NATIONAL CANDY COMPANY.

03:06.999 --> 03:11.999
AND DESPITE THOSE FACTS,

03:06.999 --> 03:11.999
PETE'S CANDY WAS REALLY GOOD.

03:11.999 --> 03:12.999
YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.

03:12.999 --> 03:13.999
Peter: WE'RE ACTUALLY FOLDING

03:12.999 --> 03:13.999
AIR INTO IT.

03:13.999 --> 03:15.999
WE'RE NOT USING A PUMP.

03:15.999 --> 03:17.999
Lemonis: I DIDN'T REALLY GET A

03:15.999 --> 03:17.999
GOOD TASTE. I NEED ANOTHER ONE.

03:17.999 --> 03:19.999
BUT BEFORE WE COULD DO A DEAL,

03:17.999 --> 03:19.999
I NEEDED TO UNTANGLE

03:19.999 --> 03:23.999
PETE AND HIS WIFE, ALLISON,

03:19.999 --> 03:23.999
FROM DANE BAIRD.

03:23.999 --> 03:26.999
Peter: HOW DO WE BUY YOU OUT?

03:23.999 --> 03:26.999
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

03:26.999 --> 03:27.999
Dane:

03:26.999 --> 03:27.999
SO, I DON'T WANT TO SELL.

03:28.999 --> 03:32.999
Lemonis: DANE HAD PUT UP

03:28.999 --> 03:32.999
ONLY $2,000 FOR HIS 50% SHARE

03:32.999 --> 03:34.999
AND HAD INVESTED

03:32.999 --> 03:34.999
NO SWEAT EQUITY.

03:34.999 --> 03:36.999
AND WHILE PETE AND ALLISON

03:34.999 --> 03:36.999
WERE COLLECTING A CHECK

03:36.999 --> 03:38.999
THAT THEY

03:36.999 --> 03:38.999
COULD BARELY LIVE ON...

03:38.999 --> 03:41.999
Allison:

03:38.999 --> 03:41.999
WE MADE $10,000 COMBINED.

03:41.999 --> 03:43.999
Lemonis: YOU CAN'T LIVE

03:41.999 --> 03:43.999
OFF $10,000 A YEAR.

03:43.999 --> 03:45.999
...DANE, WHO OWNED THE BUILDING

03:43.999 --> 03:45.999
SWEET PETE'S OPERATED OUT OF,

03:45.999 --> 03:47.999
WAS COLLECTING

03:45.999 --> 03:47.999
A HEALTHY RENT CHECK.

03:47.999 --> 03:49.999
AND HOW MUCH RENT DID YOU GET?

03:49.999 --> 03:50.999
Dane: I THINK

03:49.999 --> 03:50.999
IT'S $1,400 A MONTH, SO...

03:50.999 --> 03:52.999
Lemonis:

03:50.999 --> 03:52.999
THEIR RELATIONSHIP WAS TOXIC.

03:52.999 --> 03:54.999
Peter: I'M CALLING YOU OUT

03:52.999 --> 03:54.999
ON YOUR INTEGRITY. IT'S CRAP.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.999
I DON'T CARE HOW [BLEEP] HARD

03:55.000 --> 03:58.999
IT GETS, I WILL BE HERE.

03:58.999 --> 03:59.999
WHERE ARE YOU?

03:59.999 --> 04:04.999
Lemonis: SO, I BOUGHT DANE OUT

03:59.999 --> 04:04.999
FOR $50,000 --

04:04.999 --> 04:06.999
25 TIMES

04:04.999 --> 04:06.999
HIS ORIGINAL INVESTMENT.

04:06.999 --> 04:09.999
Peter: I NEVER THOUGHT I WAS

04:06.999 --> 04:09.999
GONNA GET DANE OUT OF MY HAIR.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.000
Lemonis: A LOT OF MONEY,

04:11.999 --> 04:13.999
BUT IT ALLOWED ALL OF US TO MOVE

04:11.999 --> 04:13.999
FORWARD AND MAKE A DEAL.

04:13.999 --> 04:18.999
FOR MY $750,000,

04:13.999 --> 04:18.999
I WILL OWN 50% OF THE BUSINESS,

04:18.999 --> 04:20.999
YOU WILL OWN

04:18.999 --> 04:20.999
50% OF THE BUSINESS.

04:20.999 --> 04:22.999
AND WITH THAT MONEY, WE WOULD

04:20.999 --> 04:22.999
START WITH SOME SMALL MOVES,

04:22.999 --> 04:26.999
LIKE IMPROVING THE PACKAGING,

04:22.999 --> 04:26.999
LAUNCHING A NEW WEBSITE,

04:26.999 --> 04:28.999
PURCHASING

04:26.999 --> 04:28.999
SOME MOBILE CANDY VEHICLES.

04:28.999 --> 04:30.999
Peter: OH, MY GOD!

04:30.999 --> 04:32.999
-Allison: OH, MY GOD!

04:30.999 --> 04:32.999
-Lemonis: BUT THE BIG MOVE?

04:32.999 --> 04:35.999
WELL, THAT WAS TO FIND

04:32.999 --> 04:35.999
A NEW RETAIL LOCATION

04:35.999 --> 04:37.999
AND BUILD OUT

04:35.999 --> 04:37.999
AN INDUSTRIAL KITCHEN.

04:37.999 --> 04:38.999
Peter: THIS PLACE

04:37.999 --> 04:38.999
THAT I'M THINKING OF

04:38.999 --> 04:40.999
IS RIGHT ACROSS FROM CITY HALL.

04:40.999 --> 04:42.999
IT'S RIGHT NEAR

04:40.999 --> 04:42.999
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.

04:42.999 --> 04:45.999
Lemonis: AND WHILE

04:42.999 --> 04:45.999
I WAS SKEPTICAL AT FIRST...

04:45.999 --> 04:47.999
IT FEELS LIKE I'M GOING

04:45.999 --> 04:47.999
INTO A HAUNTED HOUSE.

04:47.999 --> 04:50.999
...AND WE FOUND

04:47.999 --> 04:50.999
A 110-YEAR-OLD HISTORIC MANSION

04:50.999 --> 04:52.999
IN DOWNTOWN JACKSONVILLE

04:52.999 --> 04:55.999
AND PURCHASED

04:52.999 --> 04:55.999
THE PROPERTY FOR $500,000

04:55.999 --> 04:57.999
AND STARTED THE RENOVATION.

04:57.999 --> 05:00.999
IT'S BEEN FOUR MONTHS SINCE WE

04:57.999 --> 05:00.999
TOOK OWNERSHIP OF THAT PROPERTY,

05:00.999 --> 05:03.999
AND I'VE SPENT $2.3 MILLION

05:00.999 --> 05:03.999
RENOVATING IT.

05:03.999 --> 05:06.999
WE'RE JUST A FEW WEEKS AWAY

05:03.999 --> 05:06.999
FROM OUR GRAND OPENING,

05:06.999 --> 05:10.999
AND I COULDN'T BE MORE EXCITED.

05:10.999 --> 05:11.999
-Allison: MARCUS.

05:10.999 --> 05:11.999
-Lemonis: HEY, HOW ARE YOU.

05:11.999 --> 05:13.999
Allison: I'M DOING WONDERFUL.

05:11.999 --> 05:13.999
HOW ARE YOU?

05:13.999 --> 05:15.999
Lemonis:

05:13.999 --> 05:15.999
THIS PLACE LOOKS RIDICULOUS.

05:15.999 --> 05:18.999
Allison: THANK YOU.

05:18.999 --> 05:21.999
Lemonis: THIS WAS

05:18.999 --> 05:21.999
A DARK AND VERY DINGY ROOM.

05:21.999 --> 05:23.999
I'M SHOCKED

05:21.999 --> 05:23.999
HOW MUCH LIGHT IS IN IT.

05:23.999 --> 05:25.999
I'M BLOWN AWAY.

05:25.999 --> 05:27.999
THE NEW SWEET PETE'S

05:25.999 --> 05:27.999
WILL BE A DESTINATION,

05:27.999 --> 05:29.999
AND IT'S GOT A CANDY BAR THAT'S

05:27.999 --> 05:29.999
NOT ONLY GONNA EXCITE KIDS,

05:29.999 --> 05:32.999
BUT IT'S GONNA DELIGHT ADULTS.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.999
THE MOLDS LOOKS DIFFERENT.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.999
YOU BOUGHT SOME FANCY ONES?

05:34.999 --> 05:36.999
Allison: YEAH, WE'RE GETTING

05:34.999 --> 05:36.999
FANCIER AROUND HERE.

05:36.999 --> 05:37.999
Lemonis: VERY COOL.

05:37.999 --> 05:39.999
AND OUR NEW PACKAGING DESIGN

05:39.999 --> 05:41.999
IS AS PLAYFUL AND AS ELEGANT

05:39.999 --> 05:41.999
AS OUR NEW STORE.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.999
-Allison: THIS IS MY FAVORITE.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.999
-Lemonis: THIS CAME OUT GREAT.

05:44.999 --> 05:47.999
[ Chuckling ] THOSE ARE HUGE.

05:44.999 --> 05:47.999
WHAT DO THESE SELL FOR?

05:47.999 --> 05:48.999
Allison: THOSE ARE $22.

05:48.999 --> 05:49.999
Lemonis:

05:48.999 --> 05:49.999
WHAT DOES IT COST TO MAKE?

05:49.999 --> 05:51.999
Allison: $6.50 TO MAKE IT,

05:49.999 --> 05:51.999
WITH THE PACKAGING.

05:51.999 --> 05:52.999
Lemonis:

05:51.999 --> 05:52.999
AND THEN $20 WITH PETE'S LABOR.

05:52.999 --> 05:54.999
Allison: RIGHT, YEAH.

05:52.999 --> 05:54.999
DEPENDS ON WHO'S MAKING IT.

05:54.999 --> 05:55.999
Lemonis:

05:54.999 --> 05:55.999
LET'S GO FIND PETE.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.999
WHAT'S UP, PETE?!

05:57.999 --> 05:58.999
THIS PLACE LOOKS GREAT.

05:58.999 --> 06:01.999
Peter: THIS IS KIND OF LIKE

05:58.999 --> 06:01.999
WHAT YOU SEE IN THE MOVIES.

06:01.999 --> 06:02.999
Lemonis: THIS IS THE HEART

06:01.999 --> 06:02.999
OF SWEET PETE'S --

06:02.999 --> 06:06.999
A SLEEK,

06:02.999 --> 06:06.999
MODERN INDUSTRIAL KITCHEN.

06:06.999 --> 06:08.999
Peter: WELL, THIS WILL HOLD

06:06.999 --> 06:08.999
450 POUNDS OF DARK CHOCOLATE.

06:08.999 --> 06:09.999
AND THIS IS A COOKER.

06:09.999 --> 06:12.999
Lemonis: WE BOUGHT

06:09.999 --> 06:12.999
STATE-OF-THE-ART MIXERS,

06:12.999 --> 06:15.999
REFRIGERATORS, TOFFEE MAKERS,

06:12.999 --> 06:15.999
AND CANDY COOKERS,

06:15.999 --> 06:17.999
COSTING OVER $300,000.

06:17.999 --> 06:20.999
NOW, THESE TABLES ARE MADE

06:17.999 --> 06:20.999
SPECIFICALLY FOR MAKING CARAMEL?

06:20.999 --> 06:21.999
Peter:

06:20.999 --> 06:21.999
REALLY, ANY TYPE OF CANDY.

06:21.999 --> 06:23.999
Lemonis: THERE'S STORAGE, SO WE

06:21.999 --> 06:23.999
CAN HAVE PLENTY OF INVENTORY

06:23.999 --> 06:27.999
TO ANTICIPATE THE DEMAND, AND

06:23.999 --> 06:27.999
THERE'S AN AMAZING WORKSPACE

06:27.999 --> 06:30.999
WHERE PETE AND HIS STAFF CAN

06:27.999 --> 06:30.999
NOT ONLY PRODUCE NEW PRODUCT,

06:30.999 --> 06:32.999
BUT THEY CAN EXPERIMENT.

06:32.999 --> 06:33.999
SO, THIS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT

06:32.999 --> 06:33.999
THAN THAT --

06:33.999 --> 06:34.999
LIKE, WE WERE AT THE KETTLE.

06:34.999 --> 06:36.999
Peter:

06:34.999 --> 06:36.999
YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

06:36.999 --> 06:38.999
Lemonis: IT'S QUITE A CHANGE

06:36.999 --> 06:38.999
FROM THE OLD KITCHEN

06:38.999 --> 06:40.999
THEY WERE WORKING IN

06:38.999 --> 06:40.999
JUST FOUR MONTHS AGO.

06:40.999 --> 06:43.999
I NOTICED ON THE ARCHITECTURAL

06:40.999 --> 06:43.999
PLANS I SIGNED OFF ON

06:43.999 --> 06:45.999
THAT THERE'S AN EVENT CENTER,

06:43.999 --> 06:45.999
THERE'S PARTY ROOMS.

06:45.999 --> 06:48.999
Allison: YOU CAN DO

06:45.999 --> 06:48.999
CANDY COCKTAILS, BEER, WINE,

06:48.999 --> 06:50.999
ANYTHING FROM

06:48.999 --> 06:50.999
A CORPORATE LUNCHEON

06:50.999 --> 06:54.999
TO RENTING OUT THE ENTIRE

06:50.999 --> 06:54.999
BUILDING FOR A HUGE PARTY.

06:54.999 --> 06:55.999
Lemonis: WHY DON'T YOU GUYS

06:54.999 --> 06:55.999
GIVE ME A TOUR?

06:55.999 --> 06:57.999
I WANT TO SEE THE RESTAURANT.

06:57.999 --> 07:00.999
SO, THIS IS THE CANDY APPLE CAFÃ©

06:57.999 --> 07:00.999
AND COCKTAIL.

07:00.999 --> 07:02.999
Lemonis:

07:00.999 --> 07:02.999
THIS LOOKS SO COOL.

07:02.999 --> 07:06.000
Allison:

07:02.999 --> 07:06.000
IT'S STILL WHIMSICAL AND FUN

07:02.999 --> 07:06.000
BUT IN A VERY SOPHISTICATED WAY.

07:06.999 --> 07:09.999
Lemonis: SWEET PETE'S WILL OFFER

07:06.999 --> 07:09.999
MUCH MORE THAN CANDY.

07:09.999 --> 07:11.999
IT WILL ALSO OFFER

07:09.999 --> 07:11.999
A FULL-SERVICE RESTAURANT,

07:11.999 --> 07:14.999
FACTORY TOURS,

07:11.999 --> 07:14.999
AND CANDY-MAKING CLASSES.

07:14.999 --> 07:17.999
WE HAVE SPACE FOR BIRTHDAYS,

07:14.999 --> 07:17.999
CORPORATE EVENTS,

07:17.999 --> 07:18.999
AND EVEN WEDDINGS.

07:18.999 --> 07:21.999
WE'LL GENERATE REVENUE

07:18.999 --> 07:21.999
IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS,

07:21.999 --> 07:23.999
AND WE'VE ALREADY SEEN

07:21.999 --> 07:23.999
A JUMP IN SALES.

07:23.999 --> 07:25.999
RIGHT AFTER

07:23.999 --> 07:25.999
THE FIRST SHOW AIRED,

07:25.999 --> 07:27.999
WHAT KIND OF VOLUME WERE YOU

07:25.999 --> 07:27.999
SEEING ON THE INTERNET?

07:27.999 --> 07:28.999
Allison:

07:27.999 --> 07:28.999
OH, IT WAS CRAZY.

07:28.999 --> 07:30.999
WE WOULD NORMALLY DO $15,000

07:28.999 --> 07:30.999
THAT MONTH.

07:30.999 --> 07:32.999
WE DID $100,000 IN A WEEK,

07:30.999 --> 07:32.999
BASICALLY.

07:32.999 --> 07:34.999
Lemonis: WHILE IT'S

07:32.999 --> 07:34.999
AN EXPENSIVE PROPOSITION,

07:34.999 --> 07:35.999
THIS WAS THE RIGHT PLAY FOR US.

07:35.999 --> 07:37.999
Allison:

07:35.999 --> 07:37.999
IT FEELS VERY RIGHT.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.999
Lemonis: TO DATE, I'VE INVESTED

07:37.999 --> 07:39.999
OVER $3 MILLION IN SWEET PETE'S,

07:39.999 --> 07:43.999
AND WE'VE GONE FROM GENERATING

07:39.999 --> 07:43.999
$30,000 A MONTH IN SALES

07:43.999 --> 07:46.999
TO OVER $100,000 A MONTH

07:43.999 --> 07:46.999
IN SALES.

07:46.999 --> 07:48.999
AND WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED.

07:48.999 --> 07:49.999
I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE FUTURE.

07:49.999 --> 07:51.999
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GUYS ARE,

07:49.999 --> 07:51.999
BUT...

07:51.999 --> 07:53.999
Allison: THAT MEANS A LOT TO US

07:51.999 --> 07:53.999
TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

07:53.999 --> 07:56.999
Lemonis: I FEEL LIKE I'VE PUT ON

07:53.999 --> 07:56.999
15 POUNDS SINCE I MET YOU GUYS.

07:56.999 --> 07:57.999
Pete: I MEAN,

07:56.999 --> 07:57.999
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING

07:57.999 --> 08:00.999
THAT COULD POSSIBLY TOP THIS --

07:57.999 --> 08:00.999
THIS IS AMAZING.

08:00.999 --> 08:02.999
Lemonis:

08:00.999 --> 08:02.999
YOU GUYS DID A GREAT JOB.

08:02.999 --> 08:03.999
Peter: WE COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT

08:02.999 --> 08:03.999
WITHOUT YOU.

08:03.999 --> 08:04.999
Lemonis:

08:03.999 --> 08:04.999
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

08:04.999 --> 08:06.999
I'LL SEE YOU IN A COUPLE WEEKS

08:04.999 --> 08:06.999
FOR THE GRAND OPENING.

08:06.999 --> 08:08.999
-Allison: ALL RIGHT. AWESOME.

08:06.999 --> 08:08.999
-Lemonis: THANK YOU SO MUCH.

08:08.999 --> 08:10.999
-AND SEND ME MY CHRISTMAS ORDER.

08:08.999 --> 08:10.999
-Allison: [ LAUGHS ]

08:10.999 --> 08:12.999
Lemonis: I'M OUT OF CANDY.

08:12.999 --> 08:13.999
LIKE EVERY DEAL I DO,

08:13.999 --> 08:16.999
SWEET PETE'S STARTED

08:13.999 --> 08:16.999
WITH A HANDSHAKE,

08:16.999 --> 08:19.999
AND THAT BRINGS ME TO A QUESTION

08:16.999 --> 08:19.999
THAT I GET ALL THE TIME --

08:19.999 --> 08:22.999
WHY DO I DEALS ON A HANDSHAKE?

08:22.999 --> 08:23.999
-DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

08:22.999 --> 08:23.999
-Jon: I'M IN.

08:23.999 --> 08:25.999
-Richard: WE HAVE A DEAL.

08:23.999 --> 08:25.999
-Lemonis: LET'S GO TO WORK.

08:25.999 --> 08:27.999
I BELIEVE

08:25.999 --> 08:27.999
THAT DEALS ARE BUILT ON TRUST.

08:27.999 --> 08:29.999
-Nancy: WE GOT A DEAL.

08:27.999 --> 08:29.999
-Lemonis: WE GOT A DEAL?

08:29.999 --> 08:30.999
-Pete: WE HAVE A DEAL.

08:29.999 --> 08:30.999
-Woman: WE HAVE A DEAL.

08:30.999 --> 08:33.999
Lemonis: THAT'S MORE VALUABLE

08:30.999 --> 08:33.999
TO ME THAN A PIECE OF PAPER.

08:33.999 --> 08:35.999
IT'S WORKED WELL FOR ME SO FAR.

08:35.999 --> 08:37.999
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,

08:35.999 --> 08:37.999
YOU ULTIMATELY MEET PEOPLE

08:37.999 --> 08:42.999
WHO DON'T HONOR THEIR WORD,

08:37.999 --> 08:42.999
AND THAT'S WHERE I GET BURNED.

08:42.999 --> 08:44.999
IT HAPPENED

08:42.999 --> 08:44.999
ON OUR SECOND EPISODE.

08:44.999 --> 08:45.999
DO YOU KNOW WHERE I FIND HANK?

08:45.999 --> 08:47.999
MAARSE FLOWERS

08:47.999 --> 08:49.999
WAS AN INSTITUTION

08:47.999 --> 08:49.999
IN PASADENA, CALIFORNIA.

08:49.999 --> 08:52.999
WHEN THE COMPANY'S FOUNDER,

08:49.999 --> 08:52.999
JACOB MAARSE, DIED,

08:52.999 --> 08:55.999
HIS SON, HANK, TOOK OVER

08:52.999 --> 08:55.999
THE DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS.

08:55.999 --> 08:57.999
-Hank: MARCUS, NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:55.999 --> 08:57.999
-Lemonis: NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:57.999 --> 09:00.999
AND HE DIDN'T HAVE

08:57.999 --> 09:00.999
THE TOUCH THAT HIS FATHER DID.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.999
THE FRONT OF THE STORE

09:00.999 --> 09:02.999
WAS IN A STATE OF CHAOS.

09:02.999 --> 09:04.999
[ Chuckling ] LIKE, YOU DON'T

09:02.999 --> 09:04.999
EVEN KNOW WHERE TO LOOK FIRST.

09:04.999 --> 09:06.999
AND THEY

09:04.999 --> 09:06.999
WERE HEMORRHAGING MONEY.

09:06.999 --> 09:08.999
HOW MUCH MONEY WILL THIS

09:06.999 --> 09:08.999
BUSINESS LOSE THIS YEAR?

09:09.000 --> 09:10.999
Hank: CLOSE TO $200,000.

09:11.999 --> 09:14.999
Lemonis: WITH AN INFUSION

09:11.999 --> 09:14.999
OF CASH AND SOME FRESH THINKING,

09:14.999 --> 09:17.999
I BELIEVED MAARSE COULD BECOME

09:14.999 --> 09:17.999
THRIVING ONCE AGAIN.

09:17.999 --> 09:19.999
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU

09:17.999 --> 09:19.999
A CHECK FOR $100,000,

09:19.999 --> 09:25.999
BUT FOR THIS $100,000,

09:19.999 --> 09:25.999
I WANT 25% OF THE PROFIT.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.000
Hank: ALL RIGHT.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.000
I'M OKAY WITH THAT.

09:28.999 --> 09:29.999
Lemonis: WE HAVE A DEAL?

09:29.999 --> 09:30.999
Hank: THIS IS ALL DONE

09:29.999 --> 09:30.999
ON A HANDSHAKE?

09:30.999 --> 09:31.999
Lemonis:

09:30.999 --> 09:31.999
IS YOUR HANDSHAKE NOT GOOD?

09:31.999 --> 09:33.999
Hank: MINE IS.

09:33.999 --> 09:34.999
-Lemonis: DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

09:33.999 --> 09:34.999
-Hank: DEAL.

09:34.999 --> 09:35.999
Lemonis: OVER THE COURSE

09:34.999 --> 09:35.999
OF ABOUT TWO WEEKS,

09:35.999 --> 09:38.999
I INSTALLED A SYSTEM

09:35.999 --> 09:38.999
TO TRACK INVENTORY,

09:38.999 --> 09:40.999
REORGANIZED THE WAREHOUSE,

09:40.999 --> 09:42.999
WRAPPED THE VANS

09:40.999 --> 09:42.999
AND PUT IN GPS SYSTEMS

09:42.999 --> 09:45.999
TO MAKE DELIVERY MORE EFFICIENT,

09:42.999 --> 09:45.999
BROUGHT IN DESIGNERS

09:45.999 --> 09:47.999
TO RE-IMAGINE

09:45.999 --> 09:47.999
THE FRONT OF THE STORE

09:47.999 --> 09:50.999
AND MAKE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE

09:47.999 --> 09:50.999
WAY BETTER.

09:50.999 --> 09:53.999
AND I EVEN TAUGHT THEM HOW TO

09:50.999 --> 09:53.999
PROPERLY PRICE AN ARRANGEMENT.

09:53.999 --> 09:56.999
THESE MARGINS AREN'T ACCEPTABLE.

09:53.999 --> 09:56.999
WE CAN'T MAKE MONEY THAT WAY.

09:56.999 --> 09:59.999
Lemonis:

09:56.999 --> 09:59.999
I INVESTED $150,000

09:59.999 --> 10:02.999
AND COULD ALREADY NOTICE

09:59.999 --> 10:02.999
BUSINESS IMPROVING.

10:02.999 --> 10:03.999
Woman: I LOVE SHOPPING HERE.

10:02.999 --> 10:03.999
[ CHUCKLES ]

10:03.999 --> 10:05.999
Lemonis: BUT THAT WASN'T ENOUGH

10:03.999 --> 10:05.999
FOR HANK MAARSE.

10:05.999 --> 10:07.999
Hank: BETWEEN YOU AND ME,

10:05.999 --> 10:07.999
I'M NOT GONNA TAKE YOUR DEAL.

10:07.999 --> 10:10.999
Lemonis: WHY'S THAT?

10:07.999 --> 10:10.999
WE HAD A HANDSHAKE ON IT.

10:10.999 --> 10:11.999
Hank: WELL, YOU SAID YOU

10:10.999 --> 10:11.999
WERE GONNA GIVE US $100,000.

10:11.999 --> 10:13.999
Lemonis:

10:11.999 --> 10:13.999
I SPENT OVER $100,000.

10:13.999 --> 10:15.999
Hank: WELL, I DON'T KNOW

10:13.999 --> 10:15.999
WHAT YOU DID SPEND.

10:15.999 --> 10:17.999
Lemonis: HANK,

10:15.999 --> 10:17.999
ARE YOU [BLEEP] KIDDING ME?

10:17.999 --> 10:19.999
Hank: YEAH, NO,

10:17.999 --> 10:19.999
I'M NOT [BLEEP] KIDDING YOU.

10:19.999 --> 10:21.999
WE HAD A DEAL,

10:19.999 --> 10:21.999
AND YOU DIDN'T DO IT.

10:21.999 --> 10:23.999
Lemonis: YOU BETTER CALL

10:21.999 --> 10:23.999
YOUR MAMA AND GET MY MONEY BACK.

10:23.999 --> 10:28.999
I HAD A HANDSHAKE DEAL, BUT

10:23.999 --> 10:28.999
THE CONTRACT WASN'T DONE YET.

10:28.999 --> 10:30.999
IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE DEAL,

10:28.999 --> 10:30.999
YOU SHOULD BE A MAN ABOUT IT,

10:30.999 --> 10:32.999
BUT TO TELL SOMEBODY

10:30.999 --> 10:32.999
THEY DID NOTHING?

10:32.999 --> 10:34.000
Hank:

10:32.999 --> 10:34.000
I'M NOT SAYING YOU DID NOTHING.

10:34.999 --> 10:35.999
I'M SAYING YOU DIDN'T DO

10:34.999 --> 10:35.999
WHAT YOU PROMISED.

10:35.999 --> 10:36.999
-Lemonis: GET OUT OF MY FACE.

10:35.999 --> 10:36.999
-Hank: FINE.

10:36.999 --> 10:38.999
Lemonis: YOU'RE A THIEF

10:36.999 --> 10:38.999
AND A LIAR AND A CHEATER.

10:38.999 --> 10:43.999
HANK WALKED AWAY. AND AT THAT

10:38.999 --> 10:43.999
POINT, I HAD LOST $150,000.

10:43.999 --> 10:46.999
TWO WEEKS

10:43.999 --> 10:46.999
AFTER THE EPISODE AIRED,

10:46.999 --> 10:50.999
HANK'S MOTHER CALLED AND

10:46.999 --> 10:50.999
SENT ME A CHECK FOR $150,000.

10:50.999 --> 10:54.999
THAT DEAL JUST COST ME TIME,

10:50.999 --> 10:54.999
BUT THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE.

10:54.999 --> 10:56.999
-Peter: MARCUS, I'M PETER.

10:54.999 --> 10:56.999
-Steve: MARCUS, I'M STEVE.

10:56.999 --> 10:58.999
-Lemonis: NICE TO MEET YOU.

10:56.999 --> 10:58.999
-Steve: NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO.

10:58.999 --> 10:59.999
Lemonis: SKULLDUGGERY,

10:59.999 --> 11:02.999
A FAMILY-RUN TOY DESIGN

10:59.999 --> 11:02.999
AND MANUFACTURING COMPANY

11:02.999 --> 11:04.999
IN ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA,

11:04.999 --> 11:07.999
WAS EXACTLY THE SORT OF COMPANY

11:04.999 --> 11:07.999
THAT I FELT HAD GREAT POTENTIAL.

11:07.999 --> 11:08.999
THE COMPANY HAD GENERATED

11:08.999 --> 11:11.999
$1.6 MILLION IN SALES

11:08.999 --> 11:11.999
THE PREVIOUS YEAR,

11:11.999 --> 11:14.999
BUT THEY

11:11.999 --> 11:14.999
WERE STILL LOSING MONEY.

11:14.999 --> 11:15.999
Steve: IT'S A BIG LOSS.

11:15.999 --> 11:17.999
Lemonis: AND WHILE

11:15.999 --> 11:17.999
THEY HAD ONE OR TWO PRODUCTS

11:17.999 --> 11:19.999
THAT HAD REAL POTENTIAL,

11:17.999 --> 11:19.999
MOST OF THEIR PRODUCTS

11:19.999 --> 11:22.999
WERE MISSING THE MARK

11:19.999 --> 11:22.999
AND COLLECTING DUST.

11:22.999 --> 11:24.999
I DON'T GET THIS GAME.

11:22.999 --> 11:24.999
IT'S NOT FUN.

11:24.999 --> 11:26.999
BUT IF I CAN INCREASE

11:24.999 --> 11:26.999
THEIR VISIBILITY

11:26.999 --> 11:28.999
ON THE TOYS THAT WERE SELLING

11:28.999 --> 11:30.999
AND PUSH THEM

11:28.999 --> 11:30.999
TO CREATE NEW TOYS,

11:30.999 --> 11:32.999
I KNEW I COULD

11:30.999 --> 11:32.999
TURN SKULLDUGGERY AROUND.

11:32.999 --> 11:36.999
SO, I DID A DEAL,

11:32.999 --> 11:36.999
AND I INVESTED $1.1 MILLION

11:36.999 --> 11:40.999
FOR 30% OF THE COMPANY

11:36.999 --> 11:40.999
AND AN ONGOING SALES ROYALTY.

11:40.999 --> 11:43.999
SO, I WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

11:40.999 --> 11:43.999
CONTROL OVER THE FINANCIAL SIDE.

11:43.999 --> 11:45.999
I DON'T WANT YOU TAKING ON

11:43.999 --> 11:45.999
ANY DEBT

11:45.999 --> 11:48.999
OR TAKING ON ANY OTHER PARTNERS

11:45.999 --> 11:48.999
WITHOUT ME BEING OKAY WITH IT.

11:48.999 --> 11:50.999
-Steve: I THINK THAT'S FAIR.

11:48.999 --> 11:50.999
-Peter: YOU WANT TO SHAKE ON IT?

11:50.999 --> 11:52.999
Lemonis: AND DO WE NEED TO

11:50.999 --> 11:52.999
RUN THIS BY YOUR DAD?

11:52.999 --> 11:54.999
-Steve: NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

11:52.999 --> 11:54.999
-Lemonis: WE HAVE A DEAL?

11:54.999 --> 11:56.999
Steve: I FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT.

11:54.999 --> 11:56.999
LET'S DO IT.

11:56.999 --> 11:57.999
Lemonis:

11:56.999 --> 11:57.999
SO I WENT TO WORK.

11:57.999 --> 12:02.999
I SPENT $105,000

11:57.999 --> 12:02.999
TO REDO THEIR FACILITY...

12:02.999 --> 12:03.999
WE'RE IN THE TOY BUSINESS.

12:03.999 --> 12:05.999
Lemonis: ...AND BUILT

12:03.999 --> 12:05.999
A STATE-OF-THE-ART DESIGN ROOM.

12:05.999 --> 12:08.999
SO, THIS WHOLE ROOM

12:05.999 --> 12:08.999
IS GONNA TURN INTO A LAB.

12:08.999 --> 12:09.999
AND WE FOUND A 3-D PRINTER

12:09.999 --> 12:13.999
THAT ALLOWED US TO CREATE

12:09.999 --> 12:13.999
PROTOTYPES FOR NEW TOYS.

12:13.999 --> 12:14.999
-WILL YOU TAKE A CREDIT CARD?

12:13.999 --> 12:14.999
-Man: WE'LL TAKE A CREDIT CARD.

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
Lemonis:

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
IT WAS A $240,000 INVESTMENT,

12:18.999 --> 12:19.999
THIS IS PRINTED?

12:19.999 --> 12:20.999
-Man: THAT WAS PRINTED.

12:19.999 --> 12:20.999
-Man #2: LAYER BY LAYER.

12:20.999 --> 12:22.999
Lemonis: AND I GOT THEM

12:20.999 --> 12:22.999
A MEETING WITH NASCAR,

12:23.000 --> 12:24.999
AND THE PLAN WAS TO DO

12:23.000 --> 12:24.999
A LICENSING DEAL

12:24.999 --> 12:28.999
TO MAKE THE PRODUCTS MORE

12:24.999 --> 12:28.999
APPEALING TO BIG-BOX RETAILERS

12:28.999 --> 12:30.999
AND SELL THEIR

12:28.999 --> 12:30.999
GLOW-IN-THE-DARK RACECARS

12:30.999 --> 12:32.999
TO A MUCH BIGGER AUDIENCE.

12:32.999 --> 12:34.999
Man: WHAT ABOUT YOUR COMPANY

12:32.999 --> 12:34.999
WILL HELP THE NASCAR BRAND?

12:34.999 --> 12:36.999
Steve: LET ME GO FIRST.

12:34.999 --> 12:36.999
[ Laughing ] "HEY, STEVE,

12:36.999 --> 12:38.999
WHY DO YOU THINK NASCAR'S

12:36.999 --> 12:38.999
GOOD FOR SKULLDUGGERY?"

12:38.999 --> 12:39.999
[ CHUCKLES ]

12:39.999 --> 12:43.999
Lemonis: AND THAT'S WHERE

12:39.999 --> 12:43.999
THINGS BEGAN TO FALL APART.

12:43.999 --> 12:44.999
Steve: YOU KNOW,

12:43.999 --> 12:44.999
I JUST MET WITH TOYS "R" US,

12:44.999 --> 12:45.999
WALGREENS, AND KMART.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.999
-Man: YEAH.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.999
-Steve: AND...

12:48.000 --> 12:50.999
THEY DIDN'T THINK

12:48.000 --> 12:50.999
NASCAR WAS A GOOD IDEA.

12:52.999 --> 12:54.999
NO INTEREST AT ALL.

12:55.999 --> 12:56.999
Lemonis: I WAS FURIOUS.

12:56.999 --> 12:58.999
YOU ABSOLUTELY EMBARRASSED ME.

12:58.999 --> 13:00.999
WHEN YOU TALK,

12:58.999 --> 13:00.999
YOU'RE A REFLECTION OF ME,

13:00.999 --> 13:02.999
AND I DON'T OPERATE THAT WAY.

13:03.999 --> 13:05.999
AND WHEN I ASKED THEM TO BEGIN

13:03.999 --> 13:05.999
WORKING ON NEW IDEAS,

13:05.999 --> 13:07.999
THEY CAME UP EMPTY.

13:07.999 --> 13:09.999
I ASKED FOR ONE THING.

13:09.999 --> 13:11.999
Steve:

13:09.999 --> 13:11.999
IF YOU COULD COME UP WITH A GOOD

13:09.999 --> 13:11.999
IDEA, I WOULD LOVE TO DO IT.

13:11.999 --> 13:13.999
Lemonis: HONESTLY, I JUST FEEL

13:11.999 --> 13:13.999
LIKE YOU'VE BASICALLY JUST SAID,

13:13.999 --> 13:14.999
[BLEEP] YOU.

13:13.999 --> 13:14.999
I'M JUST NOT GONNA DO IT."

13:14.999 --> 13:17.999
THEY DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE

13:14.999 --> 13:17.999
CREATIVE DIRECTION,

13:17.999 --> 13:19.999
AND THEY ALSO DIDN'T WANT ME

13:17.999 --> 13:19.999
TO CONTROL THEIR FINANCES --

13:19.999 --> 13:22.999
A CONDITION

13:19.999 --> 13:22.999
OF THE ORIGINAL DEAL.

13:22.999 --> 13:23.999
Steve: I'D LIKE YOU TO SIT DOWN

13:22.999 --> 13:23.999
AND TALK TO MY FATHER.

13:23.999 --> 13:25.999
LEMONIS: Okay.

13:25.999 --> 13:28.999
WE HAD A HANDSHAKE, AND WE HAD

13:25.999 --> 13:28.999
AGREED TO THE TERMS OF THE DEAL,

13:28.999 --> 13:31.999
AND I HAD SPENT TIME AND MONEY.

13:31.999 --> 13:34.999
BUT THEY WERE NO LONGER

13:31.999 --> 13:34.999
INTERESTED IN HONORING OUR DEAL.

13:34.999 --> 13:36.999
Pete:

13:34.999 --> 13:36.999
I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW,

13:36.999 --> 13:39.999
WE ARE NOT GONNA IRON OUT

13:36.999 --> 13:39.999
THOSE DEAL POINTS -- NO WAY.

13:39.999 --> 13:41.999
Lemonis: YOU'RE ASKING ME

13:39.999 --> 13:41.999
TO THROW A MILLION DOLLARS IN

13:41.999 --> 13:43.999
AND BE SUBJECTED

13:41.999 --> 13:43.999
TO WHATEVER FATE YOU DECIDE.

13:43.999 --> 13:45.999
"GO STAND IN THE CORNER,

13:43.999 --> 13:45.999
AND SHUT THE [BLEEP] UP."

13:45.999 --> 13:47.999
THAT'S ESSENTIALLY

13:45.999 --> 13:47.999
WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME TO DO.

13:47.999 --> 13:48.999
Steve: WE DON'T LIKE THE FACT

13:47.999 --> 13:48.999
THAT YOU CAN SAY NO.

13:48.999 --> 13:50.999
Lemonis:

13:48.999 --> 13:50.999
I DON'T SEE IT WORKING.

13:50.999 --> 13:52.999
Steve: THEN, WE CAN JUST

13:50.999 --> 13:52.999
[EXHALES SHARPLY] IF YOU WANT.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.999
Lemonis: YEAH.

13:52.999 --> 13:54.999
STEVE, HONESTLY,

13:54.999 --> 13:56.999
YOU KIND OF [BLEEP] ME

13:54.999 --> 13:56.999
ALL ALONG THE WAY.

13:56.999 --> 13:57.999
YOU JUST DID.

13:57.999 --> 13:59.999
I WALKED AWAY,

13:59.999 --> 14:02.999
AND WHILE I WAS OUT

13:59.999 --> 14:02.999
THE $105,000 I SPENT,

14:02.999 --> 14:06.999
I MANAGED TO GET

14:02.999 --> 14:06.999
THE 3-D PRINTER RETURNED.

14:06.999 --> 14:09.999
PEOPLE ASK ME ALL THE TIME

14:06.999 --> 14:09.999
HOW IT FEELS

14:09.999 --> 14:13.999
WHEN PEOPLE TAKE MY MONEY

14:09.999 --> 14:13.999
OR THE DEAL FALLS APART.

14:13.999 --> 14:16.999
LOOK, IT STINKS.

14:13.999 --> 14:16.999
I WORK HARD FOR MY MONEY.

14:16.999 --> 14:18.999
AND I DIDN'T ALWAYS HAVE MONEY.

14:18.999 --> 14:21.999
AND SO THE MONEY THAT I DO HAVE,

14:18.999 --> 14:21.999
I TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY.

14:23.999 --> 14:26.999
-HEY! GOOD SEEING YOU.

-Pete: HOW'S EVERYTHING?

14:26.999 --> 14:28.999
WELCOME TO JACKSONVILLE.

14:28.999 --> 14:29.999
THIS PLACE FEELS REALLY GOOD.

14:29.999 --> 14:31.999

14:29.999 --> 14:31.999
AND SEE TINA'S BARS.

14:31.999 --> 14:33.999

14:31.999 --> 14:33.999
AWESOME. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.999

14:35.999 --> 14:36.999
Lemonis: SO, THIS IS IT?

14:36.999 --> 14:37.999
Richard: SO, THIS IS IT.

14:36.999 --> 14:37.999
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:43.999 --> 14:45.999

14:51.999 --> 14:52.999
WHEN I INVEST IN A BUSINESS,

14:52.999 --> 14:54.999
I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA

14:52.999 --> 14:54.999
OF WHAT I'M GONNA DO WITH IT.

14:54.999 --> 14:56.999
Carolyn: IT'LL BE THE BEST

14:54.999 --> 14:56.999
HAIRCUT YOU'VE EVER HAD.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.999
Lemonis: BUT SOMETIMES,

14:57.000 --> 14:58.999
EVEN I'M SURPRISED

14:58.999 --> 15:01.999
OF WHAT OPPORTUNITIES COME UP

14:58.999 --> 15:01.999
ALONG THE WAY.

15:01.999 --> 15:03.999
[ LAUGHTER ]

15:03.999 --> 15:07.000
IN 2013, I WENT TO NEW YORK CITY

15:03.999 --> 15:07.000
TO MEET JON AND ANDREW BARON,

15:07.999 --> 15:10.999
THE OWNERS OF CarCash,

15:07.999 --> 15:10.999
AN AUTO-BUYING SERVICE.

15:10.999 --> 15:13.999
THEY WERE HANGING ON

15:10.999 --> 15:13.999
BY A THREAD.

15:13.999 --> 15:14.999
Jon: WE'RE DANGEROUSLY LOW

15:13.999 --> 15:14.999
ON CASH RIGHT NOW,

15:14.999 --> 15:17.000
WHICH MEANS I CAN'T BUY CARS.

15:17.999 --> 15:20.999
Lemonis:

15:17.999 --> 15:20.999
THE BROTHERS HAD TAKEN OVER THE

15:17.999 --> 15:20.999
BUSINESS WHEN THEIR FATHER DIED.

15:20.999 --> 15:24.999
AND BY THE TIME I ARRIVED, THEIR

15:20.999 --> 15:24.999
RELATIONSHIP WAS FALLING APART.

15:24.999 --> 15:27.999
Jon: NEXT TIME YOU WANT TO MAKE

15:24.999 --> 15:27.999
A $7,500 PURCHASE,

15:27.999 --> 15:28.999
YOU BETTER COME TO ME FIRST.

15:28.999 --> 15:31.999
Lemonis: SALES WERE SLOWING,

15:28.999 --> 15:31.999
THE LOSSES WERE MOUNTING,

15:31.999 --> 15:34.999
AND THEY WERE $200,000 IN DEBT.

15:34.999 --> 15:37.999
WITHOUT HELP, A BUSINESS

15:34.999 --> 15:37.999
THAT HAD LASTED FOR DECADES

15:37.999 --> 15:39.999
WOULD BE GONE

15:37.999 --> 15:39.999
WITHIN A MATTER OF WEEKS.

15:39.999 --> 15:41.999
Andrew: I'LL DO ANYTHING

15:39.999 --> 15:41.999
TO FIX THIS BUSINESS.

15:41.999 --> 15:43.999
Lemonis:

15:41.999 --> 15:43.999
THE AUTO INDUSTRY REPRESENTS

15:43.999 --> 15:47.999
SEVERAL HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS

15:43.999 --> 15:47.999
TO THE AMERICAN ECONOMY,

15:47.999 --> 15:50.999
AND I FELT LIKE CarCash WAS

15:47.999 --> 15:50.999
A GREAT PLACE FOR ME TO START.

15:50.999 --> 15:52.999
SO, I STRUCK A DEAL

15:50.999 --> 15:52.999
WITH THE BROTHERS --

15:52.999 --> 15:56.999
$200,000

15:52.999 --> 15:56.999
FOR 100% OF THE COMPANY,

15:56.999 --> 15:58.999
AND THEY WOULD BECOME LICENSEES

15:58.999 --> 16:01.999
AND MAINTAIN THEIR OWNERSHIP

15:58.999 --> 16:01.999
OF THE ORIGINAL LOCATION.

16:01.999 --> 16:02.999
-Lemonis: DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

16:01.999 --> 16:02.999
-Jon: I'M IN.

16:02.999 --> 16:04.999
Lemonis: ALL RIGHT.

16:02.999 --> 16:04.999
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

16:04.999 --> 16:05.999
Andrew:

16:04.999 --> 16:05.999
ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

16:05.999 --> 16:06.999
Lemonis:

16:05.999 --> 16:06.999
LET'S GET TO WORK.

16:06.999 --> 16:08.999
AND I MADE

16:06.999 --> 16:08.999
THE MANHATTAN LOCATION THE MODEL

16:08.999 --> 16:11.999
FOR WHAT I ENVISION TO BE

16:08.999 --> 16:11.999
THE NATIONAL BRAND.

16:11.999 --> 16:13.999
THIS WHOLE PLACE

16:11.999 --> 16:13.999
IS GETTING REDONE.

16:13.999 --> 16:17.999
I SPENT $350,000

16:13.999 --> 16:17.999
TO RENOVATE THE SPACE

16:17.999 --> 16:19.999
AND DRAMATICALLY INCREASED

16:17.999 --> 16:19.999
OUR ADVERTISING

16:19.999 --> 16:21.999
TO BRING IN VOLUME.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.999
I IMPROVED THE MARGINS

16:22.000 --> 16:25.999
BY FIXING THE APPRAISAL PROCESS

16:25.999 --> 16:27.999
SO WE COULD BUY LOWER.

16:27.999 --> 16:28.999
Jon: I NOTICED THE WHEELS

16:27.999 --> 16:28.999
ARE A LITTLE SCUFFED, ALSO.

16:28.999 --> 16:30.999
Lemonis: I ALSO ELIMINATED

16:28.999 --> 16:30.999
THE WHOLESALERS

16:30.999 --> 16:32.999
SO WE COULD SELL HIGHER.

16:32.999 --> 16:34.999
THEY'RE TAKING MARGIN

16:32.999 --> 16:34.999
RIGHT OUT OF YOUR POCKET.

16:34.999 --> 16:35.999
DO YOU NOT SEE THAT?

16:35.999 --> 16:37.999
Jon: WHO THE HELL

16:35.999 --> 16:37.999
AM I GONNA SELL MY CARS TO?

16:37.999 --> 16:38.999
Lemonis: DEALERS.

16:38.999 --> 16:41.999
PREVIOUSLY,

16:38.999 --> 16:41.999
THEY WERE BUYING 70 CARS A MONTH

16:41.999 --> 16:44.999
AT AN AVERAGE GROSS PROFIT

16:41.999 --> 16:44.999
OF $1,100 PER CAR.

16:44.999 --> 16:48.999
TODAY, THEY BUY AN AVERAGE

16:44.999 --> 16:48.999
OF 220 CARS A MONTH

16:48.999 --> 16:52.999
WITH AN AVERAGE GROSS PROFIT

16:48.999 --> 16:52.999
OF $2,300 PER CAR.

16:52.999 --> 16:54.999
ON AN ANNUAL BASIS,

16:52.999 --> 16:54.999
THEY'RE GENERATING

16:54.999 --> 16:58.999
MORE THAN $5 MILLION

16:54.999 --> 16:58.999
OF ADDITIONAL GROSS PROFIT.

16:58.999 --> 17:00.999
THAT'S WHY CHANGING THE PROCESS

16:58.999 --> 17:00.999
WAS IMPORTANT.

17:00.999 --> 17:05.999
Jon: AFTER MARCUS CAME,

17:00.999 --> 17:05.999
BUSINESS INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY

17:05.999 --> 17:07.999
AND THE PROFIT MARGINS

17:05.999 --> 17:07.999
INCREASED, AS WELL.

17:07.999 --> 17:08.999
Andrew:

17:07.999 --> 17:08.999
MARCUS HAS IMAGINATION,

17:08.999 --> 17:11.999
AND THAT'S WHAT REALLY

17:08.999 --> 17:11.999
PROPELS BUSINESSES FORWARD.

17:11.999 --> 17:12.999
Lemonis:

17:11.999 --> 17:12.999
WHAT I LOVE THE MOST

17:12.999 --> 17:15.999
IS THAT THE BARON BROTHERS

17:12.999 --> 17:15.999
ARE CLOSER THAN EVER,

17:15.999 --> 17:19.999
AND THEY'RE SECURE, DEBT-FREE,

17:15.999 --> 17:19.999
AND MAKING A LOT OF MONEY.

17:19.999 --> 17:24.999
THEY'RE EACH MAKING

17:19.999 --> 17:24.999
OVER $200,000 A YEAR,

17:24.999 --> 17:26.999
WITH THE OPPORTUNITY

17:24.999 --> 17:26.999
TO MAKE A LOT MORE.

17:26.999 --> 17:27.999
Andrew: YOU GAVE US HOPE.

17:27.999 --> 17:29.999
Lemonis:

17:27.999 --> 17:29.999
I'M REALLY PROUD OF YOU.

17:29.999 --> 17:32.999
Jon: THE MAN BUILT AN ENTIRE

17:29.999 --> 17:32.999
NATIONAL BRAND IN ONE WEEK.

17:32.999 --> 17:34.999
IT'S THE MOST IMPRESSIVE THING

17:32.999 --> 17:34.999
I'VE EVER SEEN.

17:34.999 --> 17:38.999
Lemonis: TO DATE,

17:34.999 --> 17:38.999
I'VE INVESTED OVER $1.5 MILLION

17:38.999 --> 17:40.999
INTO WHAT'S NOW KNOWN

17:38.999 --> 17:40.999
AS 1-800-CARCASH --

17:40.999 --> 17:43.999
$350,000 FOR RENOVATION,

17:43.999 --> 17:46.999
$300,000 TO ELIMINATE

17:43.999 --> 17:46.999
LIABILITIES AND DEBTS,

17:47.000 --> 17:51.999
$450,000 FOR WORKING CAPITAL

17:47.000 --> 17:51.999
FOR THE MANHATTAN LOCATION,

17:51.999 --> 17:55.999
AND $450,000 FOR MARKETING

17:51.999 --> 17:55.999
AND EXPANSION EFFORTS.

17:55.999 --> 17:56.999
Man: WHERE DO I GET STARTED?

17:55.999 --> 17:56.999
WHAT DO I GOT TO DO?

17:56.999 --> 17:58.999
Lemonis: NOW I'M TAKING

17:56.999 --> 17:58.999
THE CarCash BRAND

17:58.999 --> 18:00.999
AND OPENING UP LOCATIONS

17:58.999 --> 18:00.999
ALL OVER THE COUNTRY,

18:00.999 --> 18:03.999
BUYING OVER 7,000 CARS A YEAR

18:03.999 --> 18:06.999
AND GENERATING

18:03.999 --> 18:06.999
OVER $100 MILLION IN SALES.

18:06.999 --> 18:07.999
WE'RE NOW BECOMING

18:07.999 --> 18:10.999
ONE OF AMERICA'S LARGEST

18:07.999 --> 18:10.999
AUTO-BUYING SERVICES.

18:10.999 --> 18:14.999
BUT AS 1-800-CARCASH

18:10.999 --> 18:14.999
CONTINUED TO GROW,

18:14.999 --> 18:17.999
I STARTED THINKING I WAS

18:14.999 --> 18:17.999
LEAVING MONEY ON THE TABLE,

18:17.999 --> 18:19.999
AND NOW IT WAS TIME FOR ME

18:17.999 --> 18:19.999
TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP

18:19.999 --> 18:22.999
AND GET INTO

18:19.999 --> 18:22.999
THE RETAIL BUSINESS FOR MYSELF.

18:22.999 --> 18:25.999
I WAS GIVEN THAT OPPORTUNITY

18:22.999 --> 18:25.999
WHEN I FOUND ATHANS MOTORS --

18:25.999 --> 18:29.999
A HIGH-END USED-CAR DEALER

18:25.999 --> 18:29.999
OUTSIDE OF THE CITY OF CHICAGO.

18:29.999 --> 18:33.999
OWNER PETE ATHANS

18:29.999 --> 18:33.999
HAS SPENT MILLIONS

18:33.999 --> 18:35.999
TURNING HIS DEALERSHIP

18:33.999 --> 18:35.999
INTO A MAN CAVE.

18:35.999 --> 18:36.999
HOW MUCH DEBT

18:35.999 --> 18:36.999
DO YOU HAVE ON THE BUSINESS?

18:36.999 --> 18:37.999
Pete: $6.9 MILLION.

18:37.999 --> 18:39.999
Lemonis:

18:37.999 --> 18:39.999
I'M SORRY -- HOW MUCH?

18:39.999 --> 18:42.999
BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW

18:39.999 --> 18:42.999
THE AUTO BUSINESS AT ALL...

18:42.999 --> 18:43.999
THE REASON

18:42.999 --> 18:43.999
YOU'RE TAKING A $5,000 LOSS

18:43.999 --> 18:45.999
IS 'CAUSE

18:43.999 --> 18:45.999
YOU BOUGHT THE CAR WRONG.

18:45.999 --> 18:48.999
...AND HE OFTEN FAILED TO LISTEN

18:45.999 --> 18:48.999
TO PEOPLE WHO DID.

18:48.999 --> 18:49.999
-DO YOU TRUST TONY?

18:48.999 --> 18:49.999
-Pete: NO.

18:49.999 --> 18:50.999
Lemonis: AS A RESULT,

18:50.999 --> 18:54.999
ATHANS MOTORS WAS LOSING

18:50.999 --> 18:54.999
$1.8 MILLION A YEAR.

18:54.999 --> 18:55.999
WHAT MATTERS

18:54.999 --> 18:55.999
IS THAT YOU MAKE MONEY,

18:55.999 --> 18:57.999
THESE PEOPLE'S JOBS GET SAVED,

18:57.999 --> 18:58.999
AND THE BUSINESS SURVIVES

18:57.999 --> 18:58.999
AND IT THRIVES.

18:58.999 --> 19:00.999
-THAT'S THE GOAL HERE.

18:58.999 --> 19:00.999
-Pete: YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:00.999 --> 19:04.999
Lemonis: WHAT DO YOU STAND

19:00.999 --> 19:04.999
TO LOSE IF THIS BUSINESS CLOSES?

19:04.999 --> 19:05.999
Pete: I WOULD LOSE MY HOUSE,

19:04.999 --> 19:05.999
MY DREAM.

19:05.999 --> 19:07.999
IT WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC.

19:09.999 --> 19:11.999
Lemonis: SO,

19:09.999 --> 19:11.999
I MADE A DEAL WITH PETE --

19:11.999 --> 19:14.999
$3.5 MILLION

19:11.999 --> 19:14.999
FOR 50% OF THE COMPANY.

19:14.999 --> 19:16.999
-Lemonis: AutoMatch USA.

19:14.999 --> 19:16.999
-Woman: I LOVE IT.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.999
Lemonis:

19:17.000 --> 19:18.999
I'VE RE-BRANDED THE BUSINESS,

19:18.999 --> 19:21.999
AND I'VE STOCKED IT

19:18.999 --> 19:21.999
WITH AFFORDABLE CARS.

19:21.999 --> 19:25.999
LUCKILY,

19:21.999 --> 19:25.999
I KNEW WHERE TO FIND THEM.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.999
TODAY, I'M HEADED

19:25.999 --> 19:27.999
TO JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA,

19:27.999 --> 19:30.999
TO CHECK OUT

19:27.999 --> 19:30.999
ONE OF OUR NEW LOCATIONS.

19:32.000 --> 19:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

19:39.999 --> 19:40.999
THIS PLACE FEELS REALLY GOOD.

19:40.999 --> 19:43.999
-HEY! GOOD SEEING YOU.

19:40.999 --> 19:43.999
-Pete: HOW'S EVERYTHING?

19:43.999 --> 19:45.999
Lemonis:

19:43.999 --> 19:45.999
WELCOME TO JACKSONVILLE.

19:45.999 --> 19:47.999
-WHAT DO YOU THINK?

19:45.999 --> 19:47.999
-Pete: LOOKS GREAT.

19:47.999 --> 19:50.999
Lemonis: WHILE PETE IS STILL

19:47.999 --> 19:50.999
A 50/50 PARTNER IN AutoMatch

19:50.999 --> 19:52.999
AND COLLECTING

19:50.999 --> 19:52.999
A NICE PROFIT EVERY MONTH,

19:52.999 --> 19:55.999
HE IS NO LONGER

19:52.999 --> 19:55.999
AN EMPLOYEE OF AutoMatch.

19:55.999 --> 19:57.999
THE ONE THING I NOTICED

19:55.999 --> 19:57.999
IS THAT HE'S A LOT HAPPIER.

19:57.999 --> 20:00.999
Pete: IN WARREN GROVE, THERE'S

19:57.999 --> 20:00.999
A GENERAL MANAGER RUNNING IT.

20:00.999 --> 20:01.999
BETTER OFF HAVING SOMEBODY THERE

20:00.999 --> 20:01.999
WITH EVERYDAY EXPERIENCE

20:01.999 --> 20:04.999
TO RUN THE OPERATIONS

20:01.999 --> 20:04.999
OF A BIG CORPORATION,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.999
WHO HAS CAR EXPERIENCE.

20:07.999 --> 20:09.999
Lemonis: DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE

20:07.999 --> 20:09.999
BETTER OFF TODAY THAN YOU WERE?

20:09.999 --> 20:13.999
Pete: I FEEL MY STRESS LEVEL

20:09.999 --> 20:13.999
HAS DIMINISHED.

20:13.999 --> 20:16.999
MY WIFE'S PREGNANT --

20:13.999 --> 20:16.999
OUR FIRST BABY.

20:16.999 --> 20:17.999
DREAM TO BE A MILLION-DOLLAR

20:16.999 --> 20:17.999
COMPANY,

20:17.999 --> 20:19.999
NOW TO BE A BILLION-DOLLAR

20:17.999 --> 20:19.999
COMPANY ONE DAY --

20:19.999 --> 20:21.999
MY DREAMS COULD NEVER

20:19.999 --> 20:21.999
DREAM THAT HIGH.

20:21.999 --> 20:24.999
Lemonis: WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED

20:21.999 --> 20:24.999
AT ATHANS MOTORS,

20:24.999 --> 20:26.999
THE SALES WERE

20:24.999 --> 20:26.999
AROUND $6 MILLION A YEAR,

20:26.999 --> 20:28.999
BUT THE LOSSES

20:26.999 --> 20:28.999
WERE CLOSE TO $2 MILLION.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.999
SINCE THEN,

20:29.000 --> 20:31.999
I'VE INVESTED $12 MILLION

20:31.999 --> 20:35.999
TO OPEN UP NEW LOCATIONS --

20:31.999 --> 20:35.999
MY BIGGEST INVESTMENT TO DATE.

20:35.999 --> 20:39.999
BY THE END OF 2015, WE'LL HAVE

20:35.999 --> 20:39.999
NINE AutoMatch LOCATIONS,

20:39.999 --> 20:42.999
AND I EXPECT THEM TO GENERATE

20:39.999 --> 20:42.999
CLOSE TO $200 MILLION IN SALES

20:43.000 --> 20:45.999
AND MAKE A VERY HEALTHY PROFIT.

20:45.999 --> 20:47.999
AND THE BEST PART

20:45.999 --> 20:47.999
IS THAT AutoMatch GETS

20:47.999 --> 20:51.000
OVER 60% OF ITS INVENTORY

20:47.999 --> 20:51.000
FROM 1-800-CARCASH.

20:51.999 --> 20:54.999
NOW, THAT'S A WIN-WIN

20:51.999 --> 20:54.999
FOR BOTH COMPANIES.

20:57.999 --> 20:58.999
IF YOUR BUSINESS IS IN TROUBLE

20:58.999 --> 21:00.999
Lemonis: WHEN I

20:58.999 --> 21:00.999
COME TO CHECK OUT AN INVESTMENT,

21:00.999 --> 21:02.999
I USUALLY KNOW

21:00.999 --> 21:02.999
WHAT I'M GETTING --

21:02.999 --> 21:06.999
A CANDY MAKER, A CAR DEALER,

21:02.999 --> 21:06.999
A PIE SHOP.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.999
SOMETIMES, THERE'S

21:06.999 --> 21:08.999
AN EVEN BIGGER OPPORTUNITY

21:09.000 --> 21:11.999
HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT.

21:11.999 --> 21:13.999
AND THAT WAS CERTAINLY THE CASE

21:11.999 --> 21:13.999
WITH PRO-FIT,

21:13.999 --> 21:15.999
A SMALL GYM IN INDIANA

21:16.000 --> 21:18.999
OWNED BY MARRIED COUPLE

21:16.000 --> 21:18.999
TINA AND MICHAEL SENA.

21:18.999 --> 21:21.999
MICHAEL THOUGHT

21:18.999 --> 21:21.999
HIS GYM WAS ONE-OF-A-KIND,

21:21.999 --> 21:23.999
AND, WELL, IT KIND OF WAS

21:21.999 --> 21:23.999
BECAUSE IT DIDN'T OFFER

21:23.999 --> 21:27.999
THE EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES

21:23.999 --> 21:27.999
THAT MOST PEOPLE LIKE TO USE.

21:27.999 --> 21:30.999
SO, I WOULD NEED TO JOIN

21:27.999 --> 21:30.999
ANOTHER GYM IF I WANTED TO SWIM

21:30.999 --> 21:32.999
OR USE THE ELLIPTICAL

21:30.999 --> 21:32.999
OR RIDE THE BIKE?

21:32.999 --> 21:34.999
Michael: YES, SIR.

21:34.999 --> 21:36.999
Lemonis: I WOULD ONLY COME HERE

21:34.999 --> 21:36.999
FOR SPECIFIC --

21:36.999 --> 21:38.999
Michael: RESULTS. RESULTS.

21:38.999 --> 21:39.999
Lemonis: BUT FOR MICHAEL,

21:38.999 --> 21:39.999
THE BIGGEST REASON

21:40.000 --> 21:42.999
TO JOIN HIS GYM WAS,

21:40.000 --> 21:42.999
WELL, MICHAEL.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.999
Michael: I'M A BOOK AUTHOR,

21:43.000 --> 21:45.999
FITNESS-PRODUCT INVENTOR.

21:45.999 --> 21:47.999
IT'S REALLY BEEN

21:45.999 --> 21:47.999
THE MICHAEL SENA SHOW.

21:47.999 --> 21:49.999
Lemonis: NOT ONLY DID HE KEEP

21:47.999 --> 21:49.999
TINA OUT OF THE SPOTLIGHT...

21:49.999 --> 21:51.999
Michael:

21:49.999 --> 21:51.999
NOBODY WOULD RECOGNIZE HER NAME.

21:51.999 --> 21:53.999
THEY WOULD RECOGNIZE MY NAME

21:51.999 --> 21:53.999
FIRST.

21:53.999 --> 21:54.999
Lemonis: ...HE KEPT HER

21:54.999 --> 21:56.999
OUT OF THE FINANCIAL DECISIONS,

21:54.999 --> 21:56.999
AS WELL.

21:56.999 --> 21:59.999
Michael: LET'S YOU AND I HAVE

21:56.999 --> 21:59.999
A MAN-TO-MAN ABOUT THE NUMBERS.

21:59.999 --> 22:02.999
I'D RATHER -- WELL, WELL, SHE'S

21:59.999 --> 22:02.999
NOT FAMILIAR WITH THEM, SO...

22:02.999 --> 22:04.999
Lemonis: I MEAN,

22:02.999 --> 22:04.999
SHE'S A PART OWNER, RIGHT?

22:04.999 --> 22:07.999
IT JUST WASN'T WORKING.

22:07.999 --> 22:09.999
I MEAN, W-WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

22:09.999 --> 22:10.999
Tina: FROM 11:00 TO 3:00,

22:09.999 --> 22:10.999
WE'RE EMPTY.

22:10.999 --> 22:12.999
Lemonis: YOU DON'T KNOW MUCH

22:10.999 --> 22:12.999
ABOUT BUSINESS.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.999
WHAT WAS WORKING WAS SOMETHING

22:14.999 --> 22:16.999
THAT MICHAEL WAS TAKING

22:14.999 --> 22:16.999
COMPLETELY FOR GRANTED.

22:16.999 --> 22:17.999
DID YOU COME UP

22:16.999 --> 22:17.999
WITH ALL THESE RECIPES YOURSELF?

22:17.999 --> 22:18.999
Tina: I DID.

22:18.999 --> 22:20.999
Lemonis:

22:18.999 --> 22:20.999
SIDELINED BY HER HUSBAND,

22:20.999 --> 22:21.999
TINA BEGAN TO MAKE AND SELL

22:21.999 --> 22:24.999
A COLLECTION

22:21.999 --> 22:24.999
OF ALL-NATURAL PROTEIN SNACKS.

22:24.999 --> 22:26.999
Tina: I JUST STARTED

22:24.999 --> 22:26.999
THROWING SOME STUFF TOGETHER,

22:26.999 --> 22:27.999
SEE HOW IT TASTED.

22:27.999 --> 22:28.999
-Lemonis: THEY TASTE GOOD.

22:27.999 --> 22:28.999
-Tina: [ CHUCKLES ]

22:28.999 --> 22:32.999
Lemonis:

22:28.999 --> 22:32.999
I SAW A LOT OF POTENTIAL

22:28.999 --> 22:32.999
IN TINA AND HER SNACKS,

22:32.999 --> 22:35.999
AND I ALSO SAW

22:32.999 --> 22:35.999
INCREDIBLE PASSION IN MICHAEL.

22:35.999 --> 22:36.999
Michael: CHEST UP. ATTABOY.

22:36.999 --> 22:37.999
NICE, HIGH THIGHS!

22:37.999 --> 22:40.999
Lemonis: SO, I DECIDED TO MAKE

22:37.999 --> 22:40.999
TWO DEALS WITH THE SENAS --

22:40.999 --> 22:43.999
$50,000 FOR A 50% STAKE

22:40.999 --> 22:43.999
IN TINA'S PROTEIN SNACKS...

22:43.999 --> 22:45.999
Tina: THANK YOU.

22:45.999 --> 22:50.999
Lemonis: ...AND $250,000

22:45.999 --> 22:50.999
FOR A 75% INTEREST IN PRO-FIT.

22:50.999 --> 22:54.999
BUT MICHAEL RESENTED

22:50.999 --> 22:54.999
HIS WIFE'S NEW BUSINESS VENTURE.

22:54.999 --> 22:55.999
Michael:

22:54.999 --> 22:55.999
WHEN WE MET A LONG TIME AGO,

22:55.999 --> 22:57.999
WE SAID WE WOULD DO EVERYTHING

22:55.999 --> 22:57.999
TOGETHER.

22:57.999 --> 23:00.999
ME SITTING OUT HERE

22:57.999 --> 23:00.999
LIKE I'M SOME CHOOCH.

23:00.999 --> 23:02.999
Tina: I'VE DONE

23:00.999 --> 23:02.999
A LOT OF [BLEEP] FOR YOU.

23:02.999 --> 23:04.999
-Michael: YOU TALK TOO MUCH.

23:02.999 --> 23:04.999
-Tina: THIS IS -- NO.

23:04.999 --> 23:07.999
Lemonis:

23:04.999 --> 23:07.999
AND I DECIDED I COULD NO LONGER

23:04.999 --> 23:07.999
TRUST HIM WITH MY INVESTMENT.

23:07.999 --> 23:10.999
YOU'RE OFF DISTRACTED LOOKING

23:07.999 --> 23:10.999
AT SOMEBODY ELSE'S BUSINESS.

23:10.999 --> 23:11.999
THE DEAL'S OFF.

23:11.999 --> 23:14.999
IT WAS THE WAKE-UP CALL

23:11.999 --> 23:14.999
THAT MICHAEL NEEDED.

23:14.999 --> 23:15.999
Michael: [ Voice breaking ]

23:14.999 --> 23:15.999
DO YOU THINK I LIKE TO STAND

23:15.999 --> 23:18.999
NEXT TO A MAN LIKE YOU,

23:15.999 --> 23:18.999
IN FRONT OF MY OTHER PEOPLE,

23:18.999 --> 23:20.999
AND ADMIT

23:18.999 --> 23:20.999
THAT I CAN'T BE SUCCESSFUL?

23:20.999 --> 23:21.999
-YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

23:20.999 --> 23:21.999
-Lemonis: LISTEN TO ME.

23:21.999 --> 23:26.999
MONEY IS A BYPRODUCT.

23:21.999 --> 23:26.999
IT'S NOT THE PURPOSE.

23:26.999 --> 23:27.999
AND YOU HAVE A PURPOSE.

23:27.999 --> 23:30.999
Michael: I JUST FEEL

23:27.999 --> 23:30.999
I'VE GOTTEN IN THE WAY,

23:30.999 --> 23:34.999
MAYBE HAVEN'T ALWAYS RESPECTED

23:30.999 --> 23:34.999
YOU THE WAY I SHOULD HAVE,

23:34.999 --> 23:35.999
AND I'M SORRY FOR THAT, HONEY.

23:35.999 --> 23:39.999
Lemonis: BUT HE REALIZED THAT

23:35.999 --> 23:39.999
HIS BUSINESS'S BIGGEST ASSET

23:39.999 --> 23:41.999
HAD BEEN STANDING NEXT TO HIM

23:39.999 --> 23:41.999
ALL ALONG.

23:41.999 --> 23:44.999
Tina:

23:41.999 --> 23:44.999
OH, MY GOD! NO WAY! AAH!

23:44.999 --> 23:47.999
Michael:

23:44.999 --> 23:47.999
WE EVEN WENT AS FAR AS TO CHANGE

23:44.999 --> 23:47.999
ALL OF THE BUSINESS CARDS,

23:47.999 --> 23:50.999
THE LETTERHEAD, EVERYTHING.

23:47.999 --> 23:50.999
IT WAS TIME.

23:50.999 --> 23:52.999
Lemonis: I'M AMAZED

23:50.999 --> 23:52.999
AT HOW FAR MICHAEL HAS COME.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.999
THE DEAL WAS BACK ON.

23:54.999 --> 23:57.999
I'LL GIVE YOU THE MONEY YOU NEED

23:54.999 --> 23:57.999
TO KIND OF GROW THE BUSINESS,

23:57.999 --> 23:58.999
AND WE'LL PERFECT THE MODEL.

23:58.999 --> 23:59.999
Michael: THANK YOU.

23:59.999 --> 24:00.999
Lemonis:

23:59.999 --> 24:00.999
OKAY? I'M PROUD OF YOU.

24:00.999 --> 24:02.999
Michael: THANK YOU SO MUCH.

24:02.999 --> 24:04.999
Tina:

24:02.999 --> 24:04.999
WELCOME TO THE NEW PRO-FIT.

24:04.999 --> 24:05.999
Michael: YEAH!

24:05.999 --> 24:07.999
Lemonis:

24:05.999 --> 24:07.999
TODAY, THE GYM IS THRIVING.

24:07.999 --> 24:10.999
THEY'RE OFFERING NEW CLASSES

24:07.999 --> 24:10.999
LIKE YOGA AND SPIN,

24:10.999 --> 24:12.999
AND THEY REGULARLY SELL OUT.

24:12.999 --> 24:16.999
MEMBERSHIP IS UP OVER 10%,

24:12.999 --> 24:16.999
AND THE PROFIT IS, AS WELL.

24:16.999 --> 24:20.999
STILL, I WANTED TO MAKE SURE

24:16.999 --> 24:20.999
THAT MICHAEL WOULD TREAT TINA

24:20.999 --> 24:22.999
LIKE THE VALUABLE PARTNER

24:20.999 --> 24:22.999
SHE IS.

24:22.999 --> 24:25.999
THE HEALTHIER THE RELATIONSHIP,

24:22.999 --> 24:25.999
THE HEALTHIER THE BUSINESS.

24:25.999 --> 24:27.999
Michael: HEY, MARCUS!

24:25.999 --> 24:27.999
GOOD TO SEE YOU!

24:27.999 --> 24:29.999
-Tina: HI!

24:27.999 --> 24:29.999
-Lemonis: HOW ARE YOU?

24:29.999 --> 24:30.999
-Tina: I'M GOOD. HOW ARE YOU.

24:29.999 --> 24:30.999
-Lemonis: WHAT'S NEW?

24:30.999 --> 24:34.999
YOU GUYS SEEM, ODDLY ENOUGH,

24:30.999 --> 24:34.999
MORE AT PEACE WITH EACH OTHER

24:34.999 --> 24:35.999
THAN YOU DID THE FIRST TIME

24:34.999 --> 24:35.999
WE WERE TOGETHER.

24:35.999 --> 24:37.999
AND IF YOU GUYS

24:35.999 --> 24:37.999
WEREN'T HEALTHIER,

24:37.999 --> 24:39.999
THE BUSINESS, HONESTLY,

24:37.999 --> 24:39.999
WOULDN'T BE HEALTHIER.

24:39.999 --> 24:40.999
Michael: THAT'S CORRECT.

24:40.999 --> 24:43.999
Lemonis:

24:40.999 --> 24:43.999
I SPENT ABOUT THREE MONTHS

24:43.999 --> 24:45.999
WORKING ON GETTING US INTO GNC.

24:45.999 --> 24:46.999
Michael: WOW.

24:46.999 --> 24:48.999
Lemonis: SO, NOW WE GET TO

24:46.999 --> 24:48.999
GO INSIDE AND SEE TINA'S BARS.

24:48.999 --> 24:50.999
Michael:

24:48.999 --> 24:50.999
AWESOME. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

24:50.999 --> 24:51.999
Lemonis: YOU WANT TO GO

24:50.999 --> 24:51.999
TAKE A LOOK AT IT?

24:51.999 --> 24:53.999
Michael: CONGRATULATIONS.

24:51.999 --> 24:53.999
YEAH, LET'S. AWESOME.

24:53.999 --> 24:58.999
Lemonis:

24:53.999 --> 24:58.999
THIS IS THE REAL OPPORTUNITY I

24:53.999 --> 24:58.999
FOUND AT PRO-FIT -- TINA'S BARS.

24:58.999 --> 25:00.999
AND THEY'VE TAKEN OFF.

25:00.999 --> 25:01.999
Tina: [ GASPS ]

25:00.999 --> 25:01.999
OH, MY GOSH.

25:01.999 --> 25:03.999
Michael: LOOK AT THAT.

25:01.999 --> 25:03.999
UNBELIEVABLE.

25:03.999 --> 25:05.999
Tina: WOW.

25:05.999 --> 25:06.999
Lemonis: IN NINE MONTHS,

25:06.999 --> 25:08.999
WE'VE GONE FROM A BROWNIE

25:06.999 --> 25:08.999
SOLD IN A GYM IN INDIANA

25:08.999 --> 25:13.999
TO A NEW BAR SOLD IN OVER 3,000

25:08.999 --> 25:13.999
GNCs ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

25:13.999 --> 25:15.999
FOR ME, THE HOLY GRAIL WAS GNC.

25:15.999 --> 25:18.999
Tina:

25:15.999 --> 25:18.999
FOR ME, TOO. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

25:15.999 --> 25:18.999
THIS IS WHERE I SHOP.

25:18.999 --> 25:21.999
Lemonis: AND IT'S EXCLUSIVELY

25:18.999 --> 25:21.999
AT GNC FOR A WHILE.

25:21.999 --> 25:24.999
Michael: MY WIFE'S PRODUCT ON

25:21.999 --> 25:24.999
THESE SHELVES IS JUST AMAZING.

25:24.999 --> 25:26.999
Lemonis: WITH HER

25:24.999 --> 25:26.999
AT THE CENTER OF ATTENTION,

25:26.999 --> 25:28.999
HE COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD.

25:28.999 --> 25:30.999
Michael: MY WIFE AND I

25:28.999 --> 25:30.999
HAVE A WONDERFUL MARRIAGE.

25:30.999 --> 25:33.999
IT'S SOLID,

25:30.999 --> 25:33.999
AND IT'S NOW HELPED OUR BUSINESS

25:33.999 --> 25:35.000
GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL, AS WELL.

25:35.999 --> 25:36.000
Lemonis:

25:35.999 --> 25:36.000
ARE YOU PROUD OF HER?

25:36.999 --> 25:37.999
Michael:

25:36.999 --> 25:37.999
VERY PROUD. VERY PROUD.

25:37.999 --> 25:39.999
MARCUS COMING INTO OUR BUSINESS

25:39.999 --> 25:42.999
AND HELPING US GO

25:39.999 --> 25:42.999
TO THE NEXT LEVEL

25:42.999 --> 25:45.999
WAS THE SINGLE BEST THING THAT'S

25:42.999 --> 25:45.999
EVER HAPPENED TO US AT PRO-FIT.

25:45.999 --> 25:47.999
Lemonis: MICHAEL AND TINA ARE

25:45.999 --> 25:47.999
GONNA MAKE A LOT MORE MONEY

25:47.999 --> 25:50.999
WITH THE PRO-FIT BARS THAN

25:47.999 --> 25:50.999
THEY DO WITH THE PRO-FIT GYM,

25:50.999 --> 25:54.999
AND OVER THE NEXT YEAR, WE PLAN

25:50.999 --> 25:54.999
ON SELLING ABOUT A MILLION BARS,

25:54.999 --> 25:59.999
GENERATING $900,000 IN REVENUE

25:54.999 --> 25:59.999
AND $200,000 IN PROFIT.

25:59.999 --> 26:02.999
AND WE'RE GONNA LAUNCH A NUMBER

25:59.999 --> 26:02.999
OF NEW PRODUCT EXTENSIONS.

26:02.999 --> 26:03.999
Tina: OH, MY GOD!

26:03.999 --> 26:05.999
Michael: GOOD JOB, HONEY.

26:03.999 --> 26:05.999
YOU DID GREAT.

26:05.999 --> 26:06.999
Tina:

26:05.999 --> 26:06.999
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS!

26:06.999 --> 26:08.999
-Michael: [ SMOOCHES ]

26:06.999 --> 26:08.999
-Tina: AH!

26:08.999 --> 26:09.999
-Michael: WELL DONE.

26:08.999 --> 26:09.999
-Tina: AMAZING.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.999
Lemonis: I BELIEVE IN

26:16.000 --> 26:17.999
THE THREE PILLARS IN BUSINESS --

26:17.999 --> 26:20.999
PEOPLE, PROCESS, AND PRODUCT --

26:20.999 --> 26:23.999
AND IT'S BEEN MY MANTRA IN LIFE

26:20.999 --> 26:23.999
AND ON THE SHOW.

26:23.999 --> 26:25.999
IMPROVING THE PRODUCT

26:23.999 --> 26:25.999
IS RARELY AN ISSUE.

26:25.999 --> 26:26.999
Noemi: VOILÃ .

26:26.999 --> 26:27.999
Lemonis: AT COURAGE. b,

26:27.999 --> 26:31.999
WE TOOK A WOMAN'S-CLOTHING LINE

26:27.999 --> 26:31.999
THAT WAS ALL OVER THE PLACE...

26:31.999 --> 26:32.999
Noemi:

26:31.999 --> 26:32.999
I NEVER APPROVED THIS DESIGN.

26:32.999 --> 26:34.999
-Nicolas: YOU APPROVED THIS.

26:32.999 --> 26:34.999
-Stephanie: ARE YOU KIDDING?

26:34.999 --> 26:35.999
Lemonis:

26:34.999 --> 26:35.999
...AND OFTEN POORLY MADE.

26:35.999 --> 26:36.999
IT'S DISTURBING.

26:36.999 --> 26:38.999
AND WE REINVENTED THE BUSINESS

26:38.999 --> 26:41.999
AND CREATED A NEW LINE

26:38.999 --> 26:41.999
AROUND A FEW WELL-EDITED PIECES.

26:41.999 --> 26:43.999
Woman:

26:41.999 --> 26:43.999
I LOVE THIS TOP.

26:43.999 --> 26:46.999
Lemonis: AND THERE ARE ALWAYS

26:43.999 --> 26:46.999
WAYS TO FIX THE PROCESS.

26:46.999 --> 26:48.999
MY BIG FAT GREEK GYRO

26:48.999 --> 26:49.999
WAS A COLLECTION

26:48.999 --> 26:49.999
OF MEDIOCRE RESTAURANTS

26:49.999 --> 26:53.999
MASQUERADING AS A WELL-EXECUTED

26:49.999 --> 26:53.999
FRANCHISE CONCEPT.

26:53.999 --> 26:55.999
IT BECAME

26:53.999 --> 26:55.999
A TRUE FRANCHISE CONCEPT

26:55.999 --> 26:59.999
WHEN WE STANDARDIZED THE LOOK,

26:55.999 --> 26:59.999
REFINED THE MENU,

26:59.999 --> 27:02.999
AND CHANGED THE WAY

26:59.999 --> 27:02.999
THE FOOD WAS MADE AND SERVED.

27:02.999 --> 27:04.999
All: OPA!

27:04.999 --> 27:07.999
Lemonis: BUT CHANGING PEOPLE --

27:04.999 --> 27:07.999
THAT CAN BE TRICKY.

27:07.999 --> 27:11.999
SOME ARE EAGER TO JUMP ON BOARD,

27:07.999 --> 27:11.999
BUT OTHERS NEEDED COAXING.

27:11.999 --> 27:14.999
AND THEN

27:11.999 --> 27:14.999
THERE ARE THESE PEOPLE.

27:14.999 --> 27:15.999
Andrew:

27:14.999 --> 27:15.999
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!

27:15.999 --> 27:17.999
-Woman: DON'T EVEN GO THERE.

27:15.999 --> 27:17.999
-Andrew: I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

27:17.999 --> 27:19.999
-Gary: BULL[BLEEP] I DIDN'T.

27:17.999 --> 27:19.999
-Lemonis: BULL[BLEEP] WHEN?

27:19.999 --> 27:21.999
John: I'M NOT SELLING MY SOUL

27:19.999 --> 27:21.999
TO ANYBODY

27:21.999 --> 27:22.999
TO PUT UP WITH YOUR [BLEEP]

27:23.999 --> 27:26.999
Lemonis: THE OWNERS

27:23.999 --> 27:26.999
OF KEY LIME PIE, JIM AND ALISON,

27:26.999 --> 27:29.999
HAD THREE PIE STORES,

27:29.999 --> 27:32.999
BUT BUSINESS WAS BAD AND THEY

27:29.999 --> 27:32.999
HADN'T TAKEN A CHECK IN MONTHS.

27:32.999 --> 27:34.999
I WANTED TO SHUT DOWN

27:32.999 --> 27:34.999
ONE OF THE STORES.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.999
IT WAS LOSING $25,000 A YEAR

27:35.000 --> 27:38.999
AND IT WAS A NO-BRAINER.

27:38.999 --> 27:39.999
Jim: YOU'RE COMING IN HERE.

27:39.999 --> 27:41.999
YOU'RE TELLING ME

27:39.999 --> 27:41.999
YOU'RE CLOSING THE STORE.

27:41.999 --> 27:42.999
Lemonis: THAT'S RIGHT.

27:42.999 --> 27:43.999
Jim:

27:42.999 --> 27:43.999
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA PULL NEXT?

27:43.999 --> 27:45.999
I MEAN,

27:43.999 --> 27:45.999
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TOMORROW?

27:45.999 --> 27:47.999
Lemonis: WHATEVER IT TAKES

27:45.999 --> 27:47.999
TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL.

27:47.999 --> 27:49.999
WHATEVER IT TAKES,

27:49.999 --> 27:51.999
BECAUSE THE PLAN THAT

27:49.999 --> 27:51.999
YOU GUYS HAVE HAD DIDN'T WORK.

27:51.999 --> 27:52.999
WE'RE CLOSING THE STORE.

27:52.999 --> 27:54.999
WE'RE DONE. I'M NOT

27:52.999 --> 27:54.999
TALKING ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

27:54.999 --> 27:57.000
-Jim: YOU BETTER BE RIGHT.

27:54.999 --> 27:57.000
-Lemonis: I KNOW I'M RIGHT.

27:57.999 --> 28:00.999
Jim: I CAN'T PUT UP

27:57.999 --> 28:00.999
WITH THIS [BLEEP] ANYMORE.

28:00.999 --> 28:03.999
Lemonis: AND THEN,

28:00.999 --> 28:03.999
THERE WAS ANDREW ROSENTHAL,

28:03.999 --> 28:04.999
THE OWNER OF LA DOGWORKS --

28:04.999 --> 28:08.999
A FULL-SERVICE GROOMING,

28:04.999 --> 28:08.999
BOARDING, AND TRAINING FACILITY.

28:08.999 --> 28:10.999
I THOUGHT

28:08.999 --> 28:10.999
THE STAFF WAS FANTASTIC,

28:10.999 --> 28:11.999
AND I LOVED THE BUSINESS.

28:11.999 --> 28:13.999
AND I THOUGHT

28:11.999 --> 28:13.999
IT WOULD BE A GREAT INVESTMENT,

28:13.999 --> 28:15.999
BUT THERE WAS ONE BIG PROBLEM.

28:15.999 --> 28:19.999
Andrew: WHO'S THE TOP DOG?

28:15.999 --> 28:19.999
WHO'S THE ALPHA MALE? ME.

28:19.999 --> 28:20.999
Lemonis: OH, MY GOSH.

28:19.999 --> 28:20.999
I HATE HIM.

28:20.999 --> 28:22.999
I SPENT SIX VERY LONG DAYS

28:20.999 --> 28:22.999
WITH ANDREW ROSENTHAL,

28:22.999 --> 28:26.999
AND I THOUGHT THERE WAS WAYS

28:22.999 --> 28:26.999
TO IMPROVE HIS BRAND.

28:27.000 --> 28:28.999
BUT THERE WERE RANTS...

28:28.999 --> 28:29.999
Andrew:

28:28.999 --> 28:29.999
E-MAIL ME THE...SCHEDULE!

28:29.999 --> 28:31.000
-Lemonis: ...AND ABUSE...

28:29.999 --> 28:31.000
-Andrew: WHO THE...

28:31.999 --> 28:34.999
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE,

28:31.999 --> 28:34.999
STARING ME DOWN?

28:34.999 --> 28:35.999
Lemonis:

28:34.999 --> 28:35.999
...AND MORE RANTS.

28:35.999 --> 28:36.999
Woman: THAT'S NOT FAIR.

28:36.999 --> 28:37.999
Andrew:

28:36.999 --> 28:37.999
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!

28:37.999 --> 28:38.999
Woman: DON'T EVEN GO THERE.

28:38.999 --> 28:40.999
Lemonis: YOU DON'T KNOW

28:38.999 --> 28:40.999
HOW TO TREAT PEOPLE.

28:40.999 --> 28:41.999
Andrew:

28:40.999 --> 28:41.999
WHAT PEOPLE? THE STAFF?

28:41.999 --> 28:43.999
Lemonis: US PEOPLE.

28:43.999 --> 28:45.999
Andrew: [ LAUGHS ]

28:45.999 --> 28:48.999
Lemonis:

28:45.999 --> 28:48.999
AND THIS WAS ONE THAT I SIMPLY

28:48.999 --> 28:50.999
JUST HAD TO WALK AWAY FROM.

28:50.999 --> 28:55.999
BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,

28:50.999 --> 28:55.999
DIFFICULT PEOPLE DO SURPRISE ME.

28:55.999 --> 28:56.999
Nancy:

28:55.999 --> 28:56.999
WHOSE PHONE NUMBER IS TAMMY'S?!

28:56.999 --> 28:58.999
WHOSE NUMBER IS THIS

28:56.999 --> 28:58.999
ON TAMMY'S PIECE OF PAPER?

28:58.999 --> 29:01.000
Tom: YOU WANT TO START

28:58.999 --> 29:01.000
AIRING THE DIRT, NANCE?

29:01.999 --> 29:03.999
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN

29:01.999 --> 29:03.999
AT A WEDDING AND [BLEEP]

29:01.999 --> 29:03.999
SOME GUY IN A BATHROOM!

29:03.999 --> 29:05.999
-Lemonis: REMEMBER THESE TWO?

29:03.999 --> 29:05.999
-Nancy: THE DEAL'S OFF!

29:05.999 --> 29:09.999
Lemonis:

29:05.999 --> 29:09.999
TOM ETHERIDGE AND NANCY PAPPAS.

29:05.999 --> 29:09.999
THEY OWNED WORLDWIDE TRAILERS.

29:09.999 --> 29:11.999
Nancy: NANCY PAPPAS.

29:09.999 --> 29:11.999
NICE TO MEET YOU.

29:11.999 --> 29:12.999
Tom:

29:11.999 --> 29:12.999
HEY, MARCUS. TOM ETHERIDGE.

29:12.999 --> 29:14.999
Lemonis: WHEN THEY WEREN'T

29:12.999 --> 29:14.999
FIGHTING AND BACKSTABBING,

29:14.999 --> 29:17.999
THIS FORMER COUPLE RAN A COMPANY

29:17.999 --> 29:19.999
THAT MADE

29:17.999 --> 29:19.999
CUSTOM CONCESSION TRAILERS.

29:19.999 --> 29:22.999
AND SO, THIS IS ESSENTIALLY

29:19.999 --> 29:22.999
A COMMERCIAL KITCHEN.

29:22.999 --> 29:24.999
THEIR PRODUCT WAS GOOD,

29:24.999 --> 29:27.999
AND THEY WERE GENERATING

29:24.999 --> 29:27.999
ABOUT $4 MILLION IN REVENUE.

29:27.999 --> 29:32.999
AND THEY WERE EVEN MAKING A

29:27.999 --> 29:32.999
PROFIT -- ABOUT $400,000 A YEAR.

29:32.999 --> 29:33.999
I WANTED IN.

29:33.999 --> 29:35.999
THE CHECK THAT I WRITE

29:33.999 --> 29:35.999
WILL BE $700,000,

29:35.999 --> 29:37.999
AND I GET 50% OF THE BUSINESS.

29:37.999 --> 29:38.999
Nancy: WE GOT A DEAL.

29:38.999 --> 29:40.999
-Lemonis: WE GOT A DEAL?

29:38.999 --> 29:40.999
-Tom: WE GOT A DEAL.

29:40.999 --> 29:42.999
Lemonis:

29:40.999 --> 29:42.999
I KNEW WITH A FEW ADJUSTMENTS,

29:42.999 --> 29:44.999
THIS BUSINESS

29:42.999 --> 29:44.999
COULD GROW QUICKLY.

29:44.999 --> 29:46.999
THEY BUILT THE TRAILERS

29:44.999 --> 29:46.999
IN GEORGIA,

29:46.999 --> 29:51.999
BUT TOM AND NANCY RAN IT FROM AN

29:46.999 --> 29:51.999
OFFICE 300 MILES AWAY IN TAMPA.

29:51.999 --> 29:52.999
Tom: WE'RE PAYING

29:51.999 --> 29:52.999
TWO MORTGAGE PAYMENTS.

29:52.999 --> 29:54.999
THAT'S LIKE

29:52.999 --> 29:54.999
2,300 BUCKS A MONTH.

29:54.999 --> 29:55.999
Lemonis:

29:54.999 --> 29:55.999
IF THEY COULD CONSOLIDATE,

29:55.999 --> 29:57.999
THEY WOULD BE

29:55.999 --> 29:57.999
MUCH MORE EFFICIENT

29:57.999 --> 29:59.999
AND SAVE A LOT OF MONEY.

29:59.999 --> 30:02.999
Nancy: 60 GRAND

29:59.999 --> 30:02.999
IS WHAT WE'RE PAYING IN A YEAR

30:02.999 --> 30:03.999
TO TRANSPORT THEM

30:02.999 --> 30:03.999
JUST DOWN HERE.

30:03.999 --> 30:05.999
-Lemonis: WOULD YOU MOVE?

30:03.999 --> 30:05.999
-Nancy: ABSOLUTELY NOT.

30:05.999 --> 30:06.999
I LIVE ON THE BEACH.

30:06.999 --> 30:09.999
Lemonis:

30:06.999 --> 30:09.999
BUT THERE WERE OTHER WARNINGS.

30:09.999 --> 30:11.999
THEY WERE CARELESS

30:09.999 --> 30:11.999
WITH INVENTORY.

30:11.999 --> 30:12.999
WHY IS THERE STUFF EVERYWHERE?

30:12.999 --> 30:14.999
-THEY DIDN'T TRACK IT.

30:12.999 --> 30:14.999
-Man: TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,

30:14.999 --> 30:16.999
THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST

30:14.999 --> 30:16.999
INVENTORIES I'VE SEEN.

30:16.999 --> 30:18.999
Lemonis: AND THEY DIDN'T

30:16.999 --> 30:18.999
KNOW THEIR NUMBERS.

30:18.999 --> 30:20.999
NANCY, YOU SHOULD KNOW

30:20.999 --> 30:22.999
DOWN TO THE NICKEL WHAT

30:20.999 --> 30:22.999
IT COSTS YOU TO MAKE AN 8.5x20.

30:22.999 --> 30:25.999
BUT IN THE END,

30:22.999 --> 30:25.999
IT WAS THEIR RELATIONSHIP...

30:25.999 --> 30:27.999
Tom: YOU DON'T

30:25.999 --> 30:27.999
NEED TO THREATEN ME, NANCE.

30:27.999 --> 30:28.999
Nancy:

30:27.999 --> 30:28.999
I'M NOT THREATENING YOU!

30:28.999 --> 30:30.999
Lemonis:

30:28.999 --> 30:30.999
...THAT DROVE ME AWAY.

30:30.999 --> 30:31.999
Nancy: 'CAUSE YOU'RE

30:30.999 --> 30:31.999
A [BLEEP] SCAMMER AND A LIAR!

30:31.999 --> 30:33.999
Tom:

30:31.999 --> 30:33.999
[BLEEP] THAT'S YOU.

30:33.999 --> 30:34.999
I CAN'T WORK WITH YOU.

30:34.999 --> 30:36.999
Nancy: THE DEAL IS OFF!

30:36.999 --> 30:39.999
-Tom: I DON'T GIVE A [BLEEP]

30:36.999 --> 30:39.999
-Nancy: THE DEAL'S OFF!

30:39.999 --> 30:40.999
Lemonis: BUT IN THE END,

30:40.999 --> 30:43.999
I WAS THERE TO BE A BUSINESS

30:40.999 --> 30:43.999
PARTNER, NOT A MEDIATOR.

30:43.999 --> 30:45.999
I CAN'T DO BUSINESS

30:43.999 --> 30:45.999
WITH YOU GUYS.

30:48.999 --> 30:53.999
BUT THIS IS A STORY

30:48.999 --> 30:53.999
WITH A TWIST -- A HAPPY ONE.

30:53.999 --> 30:57.999
A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE DEAL FELL

30:53.999 --> 30:57.999
APART, TOM REACHED OUT TO ME,

30:57.999 --> 30:58.999
AND HE TOLD ME THAT THE SHOW

30:58.999 --> 31:00.999
FORCED THEM

30:58.999 --> 31:00.999
TO LOOK AT THINGS DIFFERENTLY.

31:00.999 --> 31:03.999
MANY OF THE IDEAS THAT

31:00.999 --> 31:03.999
HE ACTUALLY DISCUSSED WITH US

31:03.999 --> 31:05.999
HAVE TAKEN PLACE

31:03.999 --> 31:05.999
SINCE THE SHOW AIRED.

31:05.999 --> 31:07.999
Lemonis: THEY MOVED

31:05.999 --> 31:07.999
THE ENTIRE BUSINESS TO GEORGIA,

31:07.999 --> 31:11.999
SAVING THEM

31:07.999 --> 31:11.999
ABOUT $100,000 IN EXPENSES,

31:11.999 --> 31:14.999
TURNING IT INTO INSTANT PROFIT.

31:14.999 --> 31:18.999
AND THEY FINALLY PUT IN

31:14.999 --> 31:18.999
A MUCH-NEEDED INVENTORY SYSTEM.

31:18.999 --> 31:19.999
Tom:

31:18.999 --> 31:19.999
WE CAN ACTUALLY KEEP TRACK

31:19.999 --> 31:21.999
OF WHEN A P.O. GOES OUT

31:19.999 --> 31:21.999
AND AN ORDER COMES.

31:21.999 --> 31:24.999
WE HAVE THE MEANS OF VERIFYING

31:21.999 --> 31:24.999
THAT THE ORDER'S BEEN FULFILLED.

31:24.999 --> 31:26.999
Lemonis: MOST IMPORTANTLY,

31:24.999 --> 31:26.999
THEY FIGURED OUT

31:26.999 --> 31:29.999
HOW TO LET GO OF THE PAST

31:26.999 --> 31:29.999
AND MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER.

31:29.999 --> 31:31.999
Tom: I SENT YOU THAT E-MAIL,

31:29.999 --> 31:31.999
RIGHT, NANCE?

31:31.999 --> 31:33.999
Nancy:

31:31.999 --> 31:33.999
WE KNEW THAT WE HAD SOME AREAS

31:33.999 --> 31:35.999
THAT WE NEEDED TO BE

31:33.999 --> 31:35.999
A LITTLE BETTER AT.

31:35.999 --> 31:39.999
WE'RE STILL PUSHING ALONG

31:35.999 --> 31:39.999
AND PUMPING OUT TRAILERS --

31:39.999 --> 31:40.999
GROWING EVERY SINGLE YEAR.

31:40.999 --> 31:43.999
Lemonis: WE DIDN'T DO THE DEAL,

31:40.999 --> 31:43.999
BUT I'M TRULY HAPPY

31:43.999 --> 31:45.999
THAT THEY TOOK SOMETHING AWAY

31:43.999 --> 31:45.999
FROM OUR EXPERIENCE.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.999
AND THEY TURNED A NEGATIVE

31:46.000 --> 31:48.999
INTO A POSITIVE.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.999
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT TAKES

31:51.000 --> 31:53.999
TO GET IT ALL THE WAY TO OPEN?

31:53.999 --> 31:54.999
Michael: $600,000 MARK.

31:54.999 --> 31:55.999
Lori: WHOA.

31:55.999 --> 31:57.999
Richard: WHAT A MESS.

31:57.999 --> 31:59.999
Lemonis: THE BUILDING

31:57.999 --> 31:59.999
ISN'T GONNA COST $600,000.

31:59.999 --> 32:01.999
IT'S GONNA COST $1.3 MILLION.

32:01.999 --> 32:02.999
Michael: IT WAS A MISTAKE.

32:02.999 --> 32:03.999
Lemonis: BUT IT'S A MISTAKE

32:02.999 --> 32:03.999
WITH MY MONEY.

32:03.999 --> 32:04.999
Michael: IT IS

32:03.999 --> 32:04.999
NEVER GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.

32:04.999 --> 32:06.999
Lori: GOD,

32:04.999 --> 32:06.999
DO YOU BELIEVE THIS?

32:06.999 --> 32:07.999
-Lemonis: IT LOOKS FANTASTIC.

32:06.999 --> 32:07.999
-Lori: UNBELIEVABLE.

32:10.999 --> 32:11.999
ANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

32:11.999 --> 32:13.999
Woman: THANK YOU, MARCUS.

32:13.999 --> 32:15.999
Mike: HERE'S TO MR. LEMONIS,

32:13.999 --> 32:15.999
AND HERE'S TO THE SIMPLE GREEK.

32:15.999 --> 32:17.999
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

32:15.999 --> 32:17.999
Lemonis: FOR ME,

32:17.999 --> 32:20.999
THESE INVESTMENTS ARE

32:17.999 --> 32:20.999
ABOUT MUCH MORE THAN MONEY.

32:20.999 --> 32:21.999
I GET A LOT OF SATISFACTION

32:21.999 --> 32:24.000
HELPING BUSINESSES

32:21.999 --> 32:24.000
HELP THEMSELVES.

32:26.999 --> 32:28.999
BUT I WON'T LET PEOPLE

32:26.999 --> 32:28.999
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ME,

32:28.999 --> 32:31.999
AND IF THEY TRY,

32:28.999 --> 32:31.999
THINGS CAN GET MESSY.

32:34.999 --> 32:37.999
WHEN I FIRST WENT TO BROOKLYN

32:34.999 --> 32:37.999
TO SEE A. STEIN MEATS,

32:37.999 --> 32:38.999
I WAS EXCITED.

32:38.999 --> 32:42.999
FOR OVER 75 YEARS, THEY'D

32:38.999 --> 32:42.999
BEEN SELLING QUALITY MEATS

32:42.999 --> 32:46.999
TO NEW YORK'S FINEST RESTAURANTS

32:42.999 --> 32:46.999
AND BUTCHER SHOPS.

32:46.999 --> 32:48.999
SO, HOW MUCH REVENUE

32:46.999 --> 32:48.999
WILL YOU DO A YEAR?

32:48.999 --> 32:50.999
-Alan: WE SHOULD DO ABOUT 50.

32:48.999 --> 32:50.999
-Lemonis: $50 MILLION?

32:50.999 --> 32:52.999
-Alan: $50 MILLION.

32:50.999 --> 32:52.999
-Lemonis: THAT'S A BIG BUSINESS.

32:52.999 --> 32:55.999
Lemonis: OWNERS ALAN BUXBAUM

32:52.999 --> 32:55.999
AND HOWARD MORA

32:55.999 --> 32:56.999
HAD TAKEN OVER A. STEIN

32:55.999 --> 32:56.999
FROM THEIR FATHERS

32:56.999 --> 32:58.999
WHO FOUNDED THE COMPANY,

32:58.999 --> 33:01.999
GROWING THE COMPANY FROM

32:58.999 --> 33:01.999
$5 MILLION TO $50 MILLION.

33:01.999 --> 33:03.999
Woman: THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

33:03.999 --> 33:05.999
Lemonis: AND THEIR HAMBURGER,

33:03.999 --> 33:05.999
THE BROOKLYN BURGER,

33:05.999 --> 33:08.999
WAS A STAPLE AT NEW YORK'S

33:05.999 --> 33:08.999
THREE BIGGEST SPORTING VENUES.

33:08.999 --> 33:10.999
-Howard: GOOD BURGER.

33:08.999 --> 33:10.999
-Lemonis: IT'S THE BEST.

33:10.999 --> 33:12.999
BUT IT SOON BECAME CLEAR

33:12.999 --> 33:15.999
THAT ALL THEIR SUCCESS

33:12.999 --> 33:15.999
WAS GOING TO WASTE.

33:15.999 --> 33:16.999
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK

33:15.999 --> 33:16.999
YOU'LL LOSE THIS YEAR?

33:16.999 --> 33:18.999
Howard: ABOUT $400,000.

33:18.999 --> 33:20.999
Lemonis:

33:18.999 --> 33:20.999
A. STEIN WAS A MESS.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.999
THEY OWED PEOPLE A LOT OF MONEY,

33:22.999 --> 33:24.999
AND THEN WHEN THEY SOLD PRODUCT

33:22.999 --> 33:24.999
TO OTHER CUSTOMERS,

33:24.999 --> 33:26.999
THEY DIDN'T EVEN COLLECT

33:24.999 --> 33:26.999
 THAT MONEY.

33:26.999 --> 33:28.999
STILL, WITH SOME

33:26.999 --> 33:28.999
SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS,

33:28.999 --> 33:29.999
I FELT LIKE I COULD HELP

33:29.999 --> 33:33.000
ALAN AND HOWARD SAVE THE COMPANY

33:29.999 --> 33:33.000
THAT THEIR FATHERS BUILT.

33:33.999 --> 33:34.999
SO WE STRUCK A DEAL.

33:34.999 --> 33:37.999
COME HERE, BIG GUY.

33:37.999 --> 33:39.999
AND I'M PUTTING IN $1 MILLION.

33:39.999 --> 33:41.999
-THERE'S THE MONEY.

33:39.999 --> 33:41.999
-Alan: THANK YOU.

33:41.999 --> 33:45.999
Lemonis: SO, IN RETURN, I WAS

33:41.999 --> 33:45.999
GONNA OWN 50% OF A. STEIN MEATS,

33:45.999 --> 33:47.999
BUT THEN I LEARNED

33:45.999 --> 33:47.999
THAT THE COMPANY

33:47.999 --> 33:50.999
WAS IN WAY MORE TROUBLE

33:47.999 --> 33:50.999
THAN I HAD BEEN LED TO BELIEVE.

33:50.999 --> 33:53.999
Woman: THEIR PAYABLES

33:50.999 --> 33:53.999
ARE ABOUT $3.8 MILLION.

33:54.000 --> 33:57.999
Lemonis: THAT'S SEVERAL MILLION

33:54.000 --> 33:57.999
MORE THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS.

33:57.999 --> 33:59.999
AND I LEARNED THAT THIS COMPANY

33:59.999 --> 34:00.999
WAS MORE THAN $5 MILLION

33:59.999 --> 34:00.999
IN DEBT.

34:00.999 --> 34:02.999
GUYS, THIS IS BAD.

34:02.999 --> 34:04.999
THIS BUSINESS IS TWO WEEKS AWAY

34:02.999 --> 34:04.999
FROM CLOSING.

34:04.999 --> 34:08.998
I KNEW I HAD TO WITHDRAW

34:04.999 --> 34:08.998
MY OFFER, BUT I ALSO KNEW

34:08.998 --> 34:10.998
THAT ALAN AND HOWARD WEREN'T

34:08.998 --> 34:10.998
GONNA BE ABLE TO MAKE PAYROLL

34:10.998 --> 34:12.998
UNLESS THEY GOT HELP

34:10.998 --> 34:12.998
IMMEDIATELY.

34:12.998 --> 34:17.998
THEY NEEDED $200,000.

34:12.998 --> 34:17.998
SO WE MADE ONE LAST DEAL.

34:17.998 --> 34:18.998
I'M GONNA HELP YOU

34:17.998 --> 34:18.998
AS MUCH AS I CAN,

34:18.998 --> 34:19.998
BUT IN ORDER FOR ME

34:18.998 --> 34:19.998
TO GIVE YOU THAT MONEY,

34:19.998 --> 34:22.998
I'M GONNA NEED TO GET A RETURN

34:19.998 --> 34:22.998
ON MY MONEY,

34:22.998 --> 34:25.998
AND THE ONLY THING

34:22.998 --> 34:25.998
THAT I CAN THINK OF

34:26.000 --> 34:28.998
IS THAT I BUY BROOKLYN BURGER

34:26.000 --> 34:28.998
FROM YOU.

34:28.998 --> 34:29.998
Alan: WE'RE WILLING TO DO

34:28.998 --> 34:29.998
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

34:30.000 --> 34:33.998
Lemonis: ON A HANDSHAKE, I WIRED

34:30.000 --> 34:33.998
THEM THE MONEY THAT VERY DAY,

34:33.998 --> 34:35.998
AND SEVEN MONTHS LATER,

34:35.998 --> 34:38.998
I STILL DON'T HAVE THE BURGERS

34:35.998 --> 34:38.998
THAT I PAID 200 GRAND FOR.

34:38.998 --> 34:43.998
BUT WHAT I DO HAVE

34:38.998 --> 34:43.998
IS A VERY EXPENSIVE LAWSUIT.

34:43.998 --> 34:46.998
PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME

34:43.998 --> 34:46.998
HOW SERIOUSLY I TAKE THIS SHOW.

34:47.000 --> 34:49.998
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU GOOGLE

34:47.000 --> 34:49.998
MARCUS LEMONIS AND STEIN MEATS

34:49.998 --> 34:50.998
AND SEE WHAT YOU FIND?

34:50.998 --> 34:53.998
SEE, I WAS HAPPY TO TAKE CARE

34:50.998 --> 34:53.998
OF THOSE EMPLOYEES.

34:53.998 --> 34:56.998
THEY DESERVED TO GET PAID --

34:53.998 --> 34:56.998
THEY DID THE WORK.

34:56.998 --> 34:58.999
ALAN AND HOWARD ARE THE ONES

34:56.998 --> 34:58.999
I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH.

34:58.999 --> 35:00.999
THEY TOOK MY MONEY

35:00.999 --> 35:02.999
AND CHOSE NOT TO HONOR

35:00.999 --> 35:02.999
THEIR END OF THE DEAL.

35:02.999 --> 35:06.999
UNFORTUNATELY, ALAN AND HOWARD

35:02.999 --> 35:06.999
WEREN'T ABLE TO SAVE A. STEIN.

35:06.999 --> 35:09.999
A FEW MONTHS AGO, THE BANK

35:06.999 --> 35:09.999
FORECLOSED ON THEIR BUSINESS,

35:09.999 --> 35:12.999
AND A. STEIN NO LONGER EXISTS.

35:14.999 --> 35:16.999
SOMETIMES DEALS FALL APART,

35:16.999 --> 35:19.999
BUT SOMETIMES THINGS

35:16.999 --> 35:19.999
JUST FALL INTO PLACE.

35:20.999 --> 35:23.999
IN SEASON ONE, I MADE A DEAL

35:20.999 --> 35:23.999
WITH MR. GREEN TEA ICE CREAM.

35:23.999 --> 35:25.999
-THAT GREEN TEA'S GOOD.

35:23.999 --> 35:25.999
-Lori: ISN'T IT GOOD?

35:25.999 --> 35:27.999
Lemonis: THE COMPANY,

35:25.999 --> 35:27.999
RUN BY THE EMANUELE FAMILY --

35:27.999 --> 35:30.999
RICH, LORI, AND THEIR SON,

35:27.999 --> 35:30.999
MICHAEL --

35:30.999 --> 35:32.999
PRIMARILY SOLD THEIR ICE CREAM

35:30.999 --> 35:32.999
TO ASIAN RESTAURANTS

35:32.999 --> 35:34.999
IN THE NEW YORK CITY AREA.

35:34.999 --> 35:37.999
Richard:

35:34.999 --> 35:37.999
YOU KNOW, MY DAD STARTED THIS

35:34.999 --> 35:37.999
BUSINESS 45, 50 YEARS AGO.

35:37.999 --> 35:41.999
HE SAW THE NEED OF HIGH-QUALITY

35:37.999 --> 35:41.999
ICE CREAM FOR THE RESTAURANTS.

35:41.999 --> 35:43.999
Lemonis: UNLIKE SOME OF

35:41.999 --> 35:43.999
THE OTHER COMPANIES I WORK WITH,

35:43.999 --> 35:45.999
THEY WERE NOT STRUGGLING

35:43.999 --> 35:45.999
FINANCIALLY.

35:45.999 --> 35:49.999
$2 MILLION IN SALES,

35:45.999 --> 35:49.999
AND THEY MADE A HEALTHY PROFIT.

35:49.999 --> 35:52.999
Richard: WE HAVE GROWN 20%

35:49.999 --> 35:52.999
EVERY SINGLE YEAR

35:52.999 --> 35:54.999
FOR THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS.

35:54.999 --> 35:55.999
Lemonis: BUT THIS WAS A COMPANY

35:54.999 --> 35:55.999
THAT WAS STUCK IN NEUTRAL.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.999
Richard:

35:56.000 --> 35:58.999
WE PHYSICALLY CANNOT FILL OUR

35:56.000 --> 35:58.999
ORDERS TO THE DISTRIBUTORS.

35:58.999 --> 36:01.999
Lemonis: THEY RAN THEIR BUSINESS

35:58.999 --> 36:01.999
OUT OF A SMALL TEST KITCHEN,

36:01.999 --> 36:04.999
AND THEY DIDN'T HAVE A FACTORY

36:01.999 --> 36:04.999
TO PRODUCE ICE CREAM.

36:04.999 --> 36:07.999
INSTEAD, THEY WOULD GO TO

36:04.999 --> 36:07.999
A THIRD PARTY, A CO-PACKER,

36:07.999 --> 36:08.999
TO MAKE THE PRODUCT FOR THEM.

36:08.999 --> 36:11.999
AND BECAUSE OF THIS,

36:08.999 --> 36:11.999
ON AN ANNUAL BASIS,

36:11.999 --> 36:16.999
THEY WOULD GIVE UP ABOUT 22%

36:11.999 --> 36:16.999
OF MARGIN, CLOSE TO $500,000.

36:16.999 --> 36:19.999
AND MICHAEL HAD A GRAND SOLUTION

36:16.999 --> 36:19.999
TO THIS PROBLEM.

36:19.999 --> 36:20.999
Michael:

36:19.999 --> 36:20.999
WE WANT TO BUILD A FACILITY

36:20.999 --> 36:22.999
AND BRING ALL THE MANUFACTURING

36:20.999 --> 36:22.999
UNDER ONE ROOF.

36:22.999 --> 36:24.999
Lemonis: BUT RICHARD,

36:22.999 --> 36:24.999
WHO OWNED 100% OF THE COMPANY,

36:24.999 --> 36:26.999
LIKED TO PLAY IT SAFE.

36:26.999 --> 36:28.999
Lemonis: AND WHAT'S HELD

36:26.999 --> 36:28.999
YOU BACK FROM DOING IT?

36:28.999 --> 36:30.999
Richard: I'M VERY,

36:28.999 --> 36:30.999
VERY CONSERVATIVE.

36:30.999 --> 36:32.999
Michael:

36:30.999 --> 36:32.999
CONSERVATIVE TO A FAULT.

36:32.999 --> 36:34.999
Lemonis:

36:32.999 --> 36:34.999
THIS WAS A COMPANY IN CRISIS.

36:34.999 --> 36:36.999
Michael: YOU ARE STRANGLING

36:34.999 --> 36:36.999
THE BUSINESS.

36:36.999 --> 36:37.999
Richard: BACK UP.

36:37.999 --> 36:40.999
YOU'RE CROSSING THE LINE

36:37.999 --> 36:40.999
BETWEEN FATHER AND BOSS.

36:40.999 --> 36:43.999
Lemonis: ICE CREAM IS

36:40.999 --> 36:43.999
A $10-BILLION-A-YEAR INDUSTRY,

36:43.999 --> 36:45.999
AND IT'S A CROWDED MARKET,

36:45.999 --> 36:46.999
BUT I FELT LIKE

36:45.999 --> 36:46.999
THEIR PRODUCT WAS UNIQUE,

36:46.999 --> 36:49.999
AND, DESPITE THEIR CHALLENGES,

36:46.999 --> 36:49.999
I MADE AN OFFER.

36:49.999 --> 36:50.999
SO, DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

36:50.999 --> 36:52.999
Michael:

36:50.999 --> 36:52.999
[ EXHALES SHARPLY ]

36:52.999 --> 36:54.999
Lori: IT'S A NO-BRAINER,

36:52.999 --> 36:54.999
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.

36:54.999 --> 36:57.999
Richard: WE HAVE A DEAL.

36:58.999 --> 37:00.999
Lemonis: WE WERE READY

36:58.999 --> 37:00.999
TO MOVE FORWARD.

37:00.999 --> 37:03.999
MICHAEL HAD ALREADY FOUND

37:00.999 --> 37:03.999
AN OLD, ABANDONED FACTORY.

37:03.999 --> 37:05.999
-Lori: WHOA.

37:03.999 --> 37:05.999
-Michael: ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?

37:05.999 --> 37:07.999
Richard: YOU KNOW, MICHAEL,

37:05.999 --> 37:07.999
THE MORE I LOOK AT THIS PLACE,

37:07.999 --> 37:08.999
THE MORE SCARED I GET.

37:08.999 --> 37:09.999
Lemonis: WE'D BUY IT...

37:09.999 --> 37:13.999
THE BUILDING IS OFFICIALLY OURS,

37:09.999 --> 37:13.999
AS SOON AS RICH SIGNS.

37:13.999 --> 37:15.999
...RENOVATE IT.

37:15.999 --> 37:17.999
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT TAKES

37:15.999 --> 37:17.999
TO GET IT ALL THE WAY TO OPEN?

37:17.999 --> 37:19.999
-HOW MUCH MONEY?

37:17.999 --> 37:19.999
-Michael: $600,000 MARK.

37:19.999 --> 37:21.999
Lemonis: OUR PLAN WAS SIMPLE,

37:19.999 --> 37:21.999
BUT IT WASN'T CHEAP.

37:21.999 --> 37:24.999
THE BUILDING

37:21.999 --> 37:24.999
ISN'T GONNA COST $600,000.

37:24.999 --> 37:25.999
IT'S GONNA COST $1.3 MILLION.

37:25.999 --> 37:28.999
THIS WAS GOING TO BE

37:25.999 --> 37:28.999
A BIG RENOVATION --

37:28.999 --> 37:30.999
$250,000 TO BUY THE BUILDING,

37:30.999 --> 37:34.999
$50,000 JUST TO GET RID

37:30.999 --> 37:34.999
OF THE GARBAGE,

37:34.999 --> 37:36.999
$100,000 TO PUT ON A NEW ROOF,

37:36.999 --> 37:40.999
$400,000 TO BUILD OUT

37:36.999 --> 37:40.999
THE INTERIOR OF THE SPACE,

37:40.999 --> 37:44.000
$100,000 TO BUILD

37:40.999 --> 37:44.000
OUT THE EXTERIOR,

37:44.999 --> 37:47.000
AND $300,000

37:44.999 --> 37:47.000
FOR STATE-OF-THE-ART

37:47.999 --> 37:49.999
ITALIAN ICE-CREAM

37:47.999 --> 37:49.999
MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.999
MICHAEL'S NUMBERS

37:50.000 --> 37:53.999
WERE OFF BY $700,000.

37:53.999 --> 37:55.000
Michael: IT WAS A MISTAKE.

37:55.999 --> 37:56.999
Lemonis: BUT IT'S A MISTAKE

37:55.999 --> 37:56.999
WITH MY MONEY.

37:56.999 --> 37:57.999
Michael: I KNOW THAT. IT IS

37:56.999 --> 37:57.999
NEVER GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.999
Lemonis: IT WAS A HARD LESSON

37:58.000 --> 37:59.999
FOR ALL OF US.

37:59.999 --> 38:02.999
BUT A FEW WEEKS AGO,

37:59.999 --> 38:02.999
I SAW THE NEW FACILITY,

38:02.999 --> 38:04.999
AND I WAS BLOWN AWAY.

38:12.999 --> 38:12.999
Lemonis: A FEW WEEKS AGO,

38:14.999 --> 38:18.999
I SAW MR. GREEN TEA'S NEW

38:14.999 --> 38:18.999
FACILITY, AND I WAS BLOWN AWAY.

38:18.999 --> 38:21.999
THE BUILDING

38:18.999 --> 38:21.999
WAS ALMOST UNRECOGNIZABLE.

38:21.999 --> 38:23.999
INSIDE, WE EXPOSED THE CEILING

38:23.999 --> 38:26.999
TO REFERENCE

38:23.999 --> 38:26.999
THE BUILDING'S HISTORY,

38:26.999 --> 38:28.999
BUT THE FLOORS

38:26.999 --> 38:28.999
ARE POLISHED CONCRETE,

38:28.999 --> 38:30.999
WHICH GIVES IT

38:28.999 --> 38:30.999
A MODERN AND SLEEK LOOK.

38:30.999 --> 38:32.999
THE WALLS, NOT MY FIRST CHOICE.

38:32.999 --> 38:35.999
BUT THIS IS MR. GREEN TEA,

38:32.999 --> 38:35.999
SO IT ALL MAKES SENSE.

38:35.999 --> 38:37.999
HEY! HOW ARE YOU?

38:37.999 --> 38:39.999
Lori: OH, MY GOD.

38:37.999 --> 38:39.999
DO YOU BELIEVE THIS?

38:39.999 --> 38:42.999
-Lemonis: IT LOOKS FANTASTIC.

38:39.999 --> 38:42.999
-Lori: UNBELIEVABLE.

38:42.999 --> 38:45.999
AND THE COLOR IS NOT --

38:42.999 --> 38:45.999
IT'S NOT BAD.

38:45.999 --> 38:46.999
Lori: YEAH, I LOVE THIS.

38:46.999 --> 38:49.999
YOU GUYS NEED YOUR...

38:49.999 --> 38:50.999
Lemonis:

38:49.999 --> 38:50.999
HOW ARE YOU, BUDDY?

38:50.999 --> 38:51.999
-Michael: WHAT'S GOING ON?

38:50.999 --> 38:51.999
-Lemonis: HOW YOU DOING?

38:51.999 --> 38:53.000
-Richard: HOW YOU DOING?

38:51.999 --> 38:53.000
-Lemonis: WHAT'S HAPPENING?

38:53.999 --> 38:54.999
-YOU LOOK A LITTLE TOO RELAXED.

38:53.999 --> 38:54.999
-Richard: I KNOW!

38:54.999 --> 38:55.999
Lemonis:

38:54.999 --> 38:55.999
SO, THIS IS IT?

38:55.999 --> 38:58.999
Richard: SO, THIS IS IT.

38:55.999 --> 38:58.999
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

38:58.999 --> 39:01.999
Lemonis: IT'S INTERESTING

38:58.999 --> 39:01.999
TO SEE HOW DIFFERENT IT LOOKS.

39:01.999 --> 39:03.999
THIS PLACE LAST TIME

39:01.999 --> 39:03.999
WAS A WAR ZONE.

39:03.999 --> 39:06.999
THIS IS OUR BIGGEST

39:03.999 --> 39:06.999
MAKEOVER TO DATE --

39:06.999 --> 39:09.000
AN 11,000-SQUARE-FOOT FACILITY

39:09.999 --> 39:11.999
AND A STATE-OF-THE-ART

39:09.999 --> 39:11.999
ICE-CREAM FACTORY.

39:11.999 --> 39:15.999
WITH ALL THIS NEW EQUIPMENT,

39:11.999 --> 39:15.999
I'M EXCITED TO SEE HOW IT WORKS.

39:15.999 --> 39:16.999
SO, WHAT DOES THIS DO?

39:16.999 --> 39:18.999
Michael:

39:16.999 --> 39:18.999
THIS IS A PINT FILLER.

39:18.999 --> 39:21.999
THIS TAKES A PINT,

39:18.999 --> 39:21.999
DROPS IT INTO THE CAROUSEL,

39:21.999 --> 39:25.999
FILLS IT WITH ICE CREAM,

39:21.999 --> 39:25.999
HEAT-SEALS IT, DATE-CODES IT,

39:25.999 --> 39:26.999
AND EJECTS IT OUT THE OTHER END.

39:26.999 --> 39:28.999
Lemonis: WHAT DOES

39:26.999 --> 39:28.999
A MACHINE LIKE THIS COST?

39:28.999 --> 39:29.999
Michael:

39:28.999 --> 39:29.999
THIS IS ABOUT $150,000.

39:29.999 --> 39:30.999
Lemonis:

39:29.999 --> 39:30.999
JUST FOR THIS LITTLE THING?

39:30.999 --> 39:33.999
