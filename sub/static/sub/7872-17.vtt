Huh?

00:39.707 --> 00:41.707
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

00:52.719 --> 00:54.019
(chuckles)

00:54.021 --> 00:55.387
I haven't ridden
a bike

00:55.389 --> 00:57.723
since Lance Armstrong
was a good guy.

00:57.725 --> 01:01.226
Geez, Lis, you're riding the
girliest bike in the world.

01:02.996 --> 01:04.863
Ooh, I stand
corrected.

01:04.865 --> 01:06.165
(hums)

01:06.167 --> 01:08.167
Hey, dipwad,
bikes only.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.869
I need to pay
my water bill.

01:10.871 --> 01:12.871
Not on motorized
transport, you don't.

01:12.873 --> 01:16.508
What you need to get
is out of our way.

01:16.510 --> 01:17.676
Yeah,
bikes win again!

01:17.678 --> 01:19.011
(train toots)

01:19.013 --> 01:20.679
Trains win again!

01:20.681 --> 01:25.717
When will you people give up
your dependence on handlebars?

01:25.719 --> 01:28.187
Quite a
Schwinn-dig, eh?

01:28.189 --> 01:29.855
Shut up,
biking Flanders.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.857
(bicycle bell dings)

01:31.859 --> 01:33.859
Chief, no, don't go
in the doughnut shop!

01:33.861 --> 01:35.527
Your pants are
too tight!

01:35.529 --> 01:37.796
Oh, I'm just gonna
eat one little...

01:43.937 --> 01:46.872
Drinkers, if you go
on the wagon,

01:46.874 --> 01:49.608
make sure it's
the Duff Beer Wagon.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.777
Oh, yeah!

01:53.213 --> 01:55.881
Duffman, how about
a 21-thrust salute

01:55.883 --> 01:57.382
to America's
military?

01:57.384 --> 02:00.552
My hips are proud
to honor our endless war.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.888
One, two, three...

02:02.890 --> 02:04.389
(cracking)
Ow, God!

02:04.391 --> 02:06.225
Something's wrong
with Barry.

02:06.227 --> 02:09.194
Never use...
my mortal name in public.

02:10.897 --> 02:12.564
I have very troubling news.

02:12.566 --> 02:13.732
(chuckles)

02:13.734 --> 02:16.568
Duffman is undergoing
hip replacement surgery.

02:16.570 --> 02:19.738
Now, Barry will be fine,
but as of this moment

02:19.740 --> 02:21.573
there is no Duffman.

02:21.575 --> 02:22.741
(gasping)

02:22.743 --> 02:24.243
They came for Joe Camel,

02:24.245 --> 02:25.744
and I said nothing.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.913
They came for the Frito Bandito,

02:27.915 --> 02:29.915
and still I said nothing.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.416
So what are you
saying now?

02:31.418 --> 02:32.751
About what?

02:32.753 --> 02:34.820
(humming)

02:37.757 --> 02:38.757
(groans)

02:38.759 --> 02:42.961
KENT BROCKMAN:
Duffman, the man, has retired.

02:42.963 --> 02:45.130
But Duffman, the idea, endures.

02:45.132 --> 02:47.132
<i>Authorities are unsure</i>
<i>whether the empty bottles</i>

02:47.134 --> 02:48.500
<i>are a beautiful tribute</i>

02:48.502 --> 02:50.502
<i>or just drunks too lazy</i>
<i>to find a trash can.</i>

02:50.504 --> 02:52.938
Either way,
the Duff Corporation announces

02:52.940 --> 02:54.439
an open televised competition

02:54.441 --> 02:57.643
to find out who will be
the next Duffman.

02:57.645 --> 03:00.612
In other news,
the Chinese land on Mars.

03:00.614 --> 03:01.647
Also, no more elephants.

03:01.649 --> 03:04.850
Now, for more cool,
refreshing news...

03:06.286 --> 03:09.955
Marge, what would you think
if I tried out to be Duffman?

03:09.957 --> 03:11.690
I know why you want
to be Duffman.

03:11.692 --> 03:15.994
It's so you can drink free beer
and get shnockered all day.

03:15.996 --> 03:18.997
Sure, I admit I get "shnockered"
once in a while.

03:18.999 --> 03:21.800
I might have been "lacquered"
from time to time.

03:21.802 --> 03:25.504
I may have, how you say, had
a subconjunctival hemorrhage.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.539
(chuckles)

03:30.476 --> 03:32.311
But this isn't
about that.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.012
Then what is this about?

03:34.014 --> 03:37.316
Marge, if I died today,
the obituary would read,

03:37.318 --> 03:41.320
"H. Simpson, father of three,
extra pallbearers needed."

03:41.322 --> 03:44.823
Being Duffman would give me
another line.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.892
Okay, sweetie, you can try.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.894
Great, but it won't
be easy.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.896
I got to start
practicing now.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.999
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah. Ow!

03:54.001 --> 03:57.469

ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

04:04.044 --> 04:07.346
your hostess,
the inescapable Cat Deeley.

04:07.348 --> 04:09.348
Are you ready to find out

04:09.350 --> 04:12.684
who will be America's
next Duffman?

04:12.686 --> 04:13.685
Yes, Cat, yes!

04:13.687 --> 04:15.087
A million times, yes!

04:15.089 --> 04:17.589
America's next Duffman
will be selected

04:17.591 --> 04:21.526
by the planet's foremost experts
in the field of party starting--

04:21.528 --> 04:24.062
best-selling electronica artist,

04:24.064 --> 04:26.565
Der Zip Zorp.

04:26.567 --> 04:29.935
Former Duff Girl and current
senator from Oklahoma,

04:29.937 --> 04:31.937
the Honorable
Missy LeBeau.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.906
I look reasonable, but I'm not.

04:34.908 --> 04:37.909
And billionaire
Mumbai entrepreneur,

04:37.911 --> 04:39.378
Rajneesh Superstar.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.947
Bottle service, ballers!

04:41.949 --> 04:44.383

04:44.385 --> 04:47.085
Now let's welcome the Chairman
of Duff Industries,

04:47.087 --> 04:49.621
Mr. H.K. Duff VII.

04:52.091 --> 04:53.091
Thank you, Cat.

04:53.093 --> 04:54.593
I just want to say,

04:54.595 --> 04:57.095
if we can't find ourselves
a Duffman out of this group,

04:57.097 --> 04:59.731
then maybe we'll just give up
on the concept.

04:59.733 --> 05:00.899
Brilliant!

05:00.901 --> 05:03.402

my grandfather repurposed

'cause he couldn't get the damn
rights to Woody Woodpecker.

Mr. Duff, can I ask
what's in this safe?

Little lady, inside that safe
is the formula for Duff itself,

09:58.265 --> 10:00.065
known only
to three people--

10:00.067 --> 10:03.768
me, Condoleezza Rice,
and my brother-in-law Terry.

10:03.770 --> 10:07.038

not known to any human...

10:17.384 --> 10:19.217
I'm proud of
my husband,

10:19.219 --> 10:22.420
but I'm not sure if this is
something Homie should be doing.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.289
Just what do you mean?

10:24.291 --> 10:26.891
Well, aren't you
making him a superhero

10:26.893 --> 10:29.060
so that beer looks
cool to kids?

10:29.062 --> 10:31.563
(laughs)

10:31.565 --> 10:32.897
Uh, Marge,

10:32.899 --> 10:34.966
let me tell you a little
something about beer.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.736
Do you know why man stopped
running around,

10:37.738 --> 10:40.405
lassoing mastodons,
and became civilized?

10:40.407 --> 10:41.573
No.

10:41.575 --> 10:44.075
So he could grow hops
and make beer.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.910
It's true.
Oh.

10:45.912 --> 10:48.580
Our beer has helped people
celebrate weddings.

10:48.582 --> 10:49.914
Enjoy a good game.

10:49.916 --> 10:51.916
Ease the pain
of a lost loved one.

10:51.918 --> 10:54.919
That's the tradition
your husband will inherit.

10:54.921 --> 10:57.589
Geez, now you make
me want to drink it.

10:57.591 --> 10:59.958
Attagirl,
have a designer bag.

10:59.960 --> 11:03.461

we needed to do in private.

11:03.463 --> 11:04.462
Okay, what...?

11:04.464 --> 11:05.463
Ow!

11:05.465 --> 11:06.831
Hey, that's not my butt!

11:06.833 --> 11:08.500
We've injected
a chip in you

11:08.502 --> 11:10.101
that detects
the slightest presence

11:10.103 --> 11:11.603
of alcohol
in your blood.

11:11.605 --> 11:13.838
You see, Duffman cannot drink.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.941
(laughing):
What? That's funny.

11:16.943 --> 11:19.444
I thought you just said
that Duffman can't drink.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.779
(laughs)

11:20.781 --> 11:22.480
But that would
be crazy.

11:26.119 --> 11:29.154
You wouldn't tell Batman
he couldn't eat bats.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.322
When you're Duffman,
you're at work, Homer.

11:31.324 --> 11:34.826
You wouldn't go to the nuclear
plant drunk, would you?

11:34.828 --> 11:36.628
Uh...

11:36.630 --> 11:38.296
Well, uh...

11:38.298 --> 11:41.366
My husband won't have
any problem not drinking.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.867
Yeah...

11:42.869 --> 11:44.869
The only reason he wanted
to become Duffman

11:44.871 --> 11:46.971
was to be respected
and beloved.

11:46.973 --> 11:48.473
Uh...

11:48.475 --> 11:52.477
And what better way to do that
than to be stone-cold sober?

11:52.479 --> 11:53.812
(moans)

11:53.814 --> 11:55.814
When my husband put
on that costume,

11:55.816 --> 11:57.816
he didn't just put
on a sleeveless shirt

11:57.818 --> 12:01.519
that says "Duff" on it
and a cape for some reason,

12:01.521 --> 12:03.321
he put on
responsibility.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.825
And boots that I don't think
will hold up in the rain.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.694
But the point is--
it's not about being drunk,

12:09.696 --> 12:12.397
it's about
being someone.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.199
You're right, Marge.

12:14.201 --> 12:19.003
I will do something no one has
ever done-- be fun sober.

12:19.005 --> 12:21.740
What a crisp
and refreshing attitude.

12:23.676 --> 12:26.911
Hey, this stuff
is pretty good.

12:30.549 --> 12:32.584
Mmm, foamy Marge.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.919
(babbling)

12:35.721 --> 12:37.355
Uh, that's the chip.

12:37.357 --> 12:38.423
No drinking.

12:38.425 --> 12:41.092
I was licking my wife.

12:41.094 --> 12:44.362
Can you believe they
put a chip in my arm,

12:44.364 --> 12:45.597
and I can't
drink beer?

12:45.599 --> 12:47.866
Ah.
Ah, gee,
tough break.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.034
Maybe Moe could dig it out
with a corkscrew.

12:50.036 --> 12:51.102
Yeah.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.037
Oh, I would love that,
Homer, I really would.

12:53.039 --> 12:55.540
But then Duff might take away
my neon sign,

12:55.542 --> 12:57.876
and, uh, it's the only thing
lighting the bar.

12:57.878 --> 12:59.944
BARNEY:
Whoa, creepy.

13:01.046 --> 13:03.047
(Bart and Lisa laugh
mischievously)

13:03.049 --> 13:05.550
Stop shooting those
at each other.

13:05.552 --> 13:09.454
Relax, honey, no one's ever
been killed by a T-shirt cannon.

13:17.396 --> 13:21.466
Oh, no, it's
the 5:00 blahs.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.469
CLOCKS:
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.905
Help us,
Duffman!

13:26.907 --> 13:28.072
(laughs heroically)

13:28.074 --> 13:29.073
(screams)

13:29.075 --> 13:31.075
Drink Duff!

13:31.077 --> 13:32.777
(crowd cheers)

13:32.779 --> 13:34.779
Care to team up
with Fruit Batman?

13:34.781 --> 13:38.082
I'm thinking of dumping
Kid Sourpuss here.

13:38.084 --> 13:39.083
I'm a hero.

13:39.085 --> 13:42.020
Oh, I can see my obituary now.

13:43.255 --> 13:45.290
Wow. Wow.

13:45.292 --> 13:48.626
COMMENTATOR: Watkins putting
for the championship.

13:48.628 --> 13:51.996
It's breaking towards the hole.

13:51.998 --> 13:55.667
Time to move from the links
to the drinks!

13:55.669 --> 13:57.502
(cheering)

14:06.779 --> 14:09.280
Well, if you guys
like commercials,

14:09.282 --> 14:10.782
you're gonna love this.

14:10.784 --> 14:13.351
Wait, we never said
we liked commercials.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.953
♪ Drink, drink

14:14.955 --> 14:16.788
♪ Let the toast start

14:16.790 --> 14:19.624

14:19.626 --> 14:21.459

14:29.969 --> 14:33.371
H.K., this new Duffman is
driving sales straight up.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.807
Turns out, men like men
who look worse than them

14:35.809 --> 14:37.308
selling them beer.

14:37.310 --> 14:40.979
Why did it take us 142 years
to discover this?

14:40.981 --> 14:43.715
Because executives are
incompetent, sir?

14:43.717 --> 14:45.483
Well, then why do I have
so many?

14:45.485 --> 14:48.186
Studies show when a decision
is made by a group,

14:48.188 --> 14:49.854
everyone feels
more confident,

14:49.856 --> 14:52.490
even though the decision
could be incredibly stupid.

14:52.492 --> 14:53.558
Is this true?

14:53.560 --> 14:54.993
(affirming)

14:54.995 --> 14:56.327
Can't argue
with that.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.328
What do you
guys think?

14:57.330 --> 14:59.163
(affirming)

14:59.165 --> 15:02.000
Did I hear a no
from section C-72?

15:02.002 --> 15:04.669
Oh, uh, no, that was
a, uh, "whoa!"

15:04.671 --> 15:06.004
(chuckling):
Oh.

15:06.006 --> 15:07.972
Give the whole
lower bowl a raise.

15:10.175 --> 15:12.176
Uh, welcome
aboard, Duffman.

15:12.178 --> 15:14.178
Fair warning
now-- at the end,

15:14.180 --> 15:17.181
I just might ask for an
autograph for my son.

15:17.183 --> 15:19.183
Here you go--
they're all pre-signed.

15:19.185 --> 15:20.018
With nicknames.

15:20.020 --> 15:22.520
Buddy, Sport, Tiger, Red.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.022
Uh, give me a "Red."

15:24.024 --> 15:25.256
I'll start calling
him that now,

15:25.258 --> 15:27.525
and then give it to
him on his birthday.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.527
Now, where to, sir?

15:29.529 --> 15:31.029
Oh, this is a romantic night.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.697
How about everywhere?

15:32.699 --> 15:34.032
All right.

15:34.034 --> 15:36.734
Navigator, set a course
for everywhere.

15:36.736 --> 15:37.869
Where the hell is that?

15:37.871 --> 15:39.604
I said everywhere!

15:40.773 --> 15:43.207
Now, Homer, look
through the beeriscope,

15:43.209 --> 15:45.209
and gaze upon
the wonderful world

15:45.211 --> 15:48.012
that you and Duff
have created.

16:03.228 --> 16:05.897
Captain, it never
dawned on me

16:05.899 --> 16:07.899
beer could have
such a dark side.

16:07.901 --> 16:10.735
You must be talking
about new Duff Stout.

16:10.737 --> 16:11.736
Take us down.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.237
I have to think.

16:13.239 --> 16:15.907
To be honest, you said
you wanted to go everywhere.

16:15.909 --> 16:18.409
So we ran out of fuel
an hour ago,

16:18.411 --> 16:20.611
but I didn't want
to disappoint you,

16:20.613 --> 16:23.314
so I will toss down
a tow rope.

16:25.617 --> 16:28.553
Hey, come here. Man...

16:30.589 --> 16:33.191
Uh... this is
not good.

16:37.596 --> 16:39.097
(sighs) Marge,
do you ever worry

16:39.099 --> 16:41.933
that you made
a giant mistake in your life?

16:41.935 --> 16:43.935
Oh, um...

16:43.937 --> 16:45.603
I need a little context.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.773
Not drinking beer has given me
the clearness of mind

16:48.775 --> 16:51.776
to realize
drinking beer is bad.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.811
I've got to undo
what I've done.

16:53.813 --> 16:56.180
Hey, how you doing?

17:00.119 --> 17:03.821
Is this the most outrageous
party you've ever been to?

17:03.823 --> 17:05.690
(cheering, affirming)

17:05.692 --> 17:07.291
Well, guess what.

17:07.293 --> 17:11.129
You've all been served nothing
but nonalcoholic Duff.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.530
(spectators gasping)

17:12.532 --> 17:15.633
BARNEY: Then why am I
throwing up right now?

17:15.635 --> 17:17.135
As Duffman, I had the power

17:17.137 --> 17:20.104
<i>to switch the beer trucks</i>
<i>working this race.</i>

17:24.977 --> 17:26.978
(screams)

17:26.980 --> 17:30.715
So you see, you don't need beer
to have a good time.

17:30.717 --> 17:33.217
Join Duffman today in saying,

17:33.219 --> 17:37.655
"I've had enough
of that life-ruining Duff!"

17:37.657 --> 17:39.657
Why the hell
did you do this?

17:39.659 --> 17:41.159
Because Duffman
is a hero.

17:41.161 --> 17:43.995
And with great taste comes
great responsibility.

17:43.997 --> 17:46.831
Well, "hero,"
here come your fans.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.499
(shouting indistinctly)

17:48.501 --> 17:49.901
(yelps)

17:49.903 --> 17:52.003
(engine starts)
So long, suckers!

17:52.005 --> 17:53.438
(laughing maniacally)

17:57.576 --> 17:59.577
What the...?!

17:59.579 --> 18:01.045
So long, suckers!

18:01.047 --> 18:03.881
(Homer laughing maniacally)

18:03.883 --> 18:04.882
What the...?!

18:04.884 --> 18:06.250
It's a circle.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.586
So the answer is--
go in reverse.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.054
So long, suckers.

18:10.056 --> 18:11.522
(Homer laughing maniacally)

18:11.524 --> 18:12.390
What the...?!

18:12.392 --> 18:14.392
I'm not sure
how many more times

18:14.394 --> 18:17.395
we can watch Dad chased down
by an angry crowd

18:17.397 --> 18:19.263
before it affects us
psychologically.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.265
As a family therapist,
I can assure you

18:21.267 --> 18:23.534
that you have
all the coping skills you need.

18:23.536 --> 18:25.870
Why is Lisa talking
to an empty seat?

18:25.872 --> 18:27.872
See you next Tuesday,
Dr. Schulman.

18:27.874 --> 18:28.873
Oh, right.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.708
You're in Maui.

18:30.710 --> 18:31.742
(whimpers)

18:31.744 --> 18:33.377
Hey, my beer.

18:33.379 --> 18:34.212
(screams)

18:34.214 --> 18:37.448
(panting frantically)

18:37.450 --> 18:39.884
(gargling)

18:39.886 --> 18:41.619
Get him back
in uniform.

18:43.222 --> 18:45.056
Hmm.

18:45.058 --> 18:46.390
Homer, now,
listen to me.

18:46.392 --> 18:48.893
You're in a stadium
surrounded by people

18:48.895 --> 18:50.228
who want to kill you.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.563
They don't have the guts.

18:52.565 --> 18:53.898
Ow.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.234
Now, there's one way
out of your hell.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.736
Prove you still
love beer.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.738
Drink this
with gusto.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.140
B-But the chip.

19:02.142 --> 19:03.407
There never was
a chip.

19:03.409 --> 19:05.810
It was all the power
of suggestion.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.145
You tricked me!

19:07.147 --> 19:09.480
And I trusted you
after you snuck up

19:09.482 --> 19:12.250
and injected me
without my consent.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.252
Just drink the beer,
pretty boy.

19:14.254 --> 19:17.655
Whatever you do,
you'll be my hero.

19:18.957 --> 19:20.958
Now you're
pushing it.

19:20.960 --> 19:24.829
Homie, it's
time to go.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.164
Come on, come on.

19:26.166 --> 19:28.499
Give me the beer
inside you!

19:31.603 --> 19:34.605
This place seems
even sadder than before.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.774
Uh, yeah, well, I kind of
gloomed it up a little

19:36.776 --> 19:37.842
while you were gone.

19:38.944 --> 19:41.112
Nothing to see here, sunshine.

19:41.114 --> 19:42.446
(sighs)

19:42.448 --> 19:45.449
(slurring):
H-Hey, y-you used
to be Duffman.

19:45.451 --> 19:47.285
Can I get a
picture with you?

19:47.287 --> 19:48.119
(gasps)

19:48.121 --> 19:49.620
I finally made it.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.455
I'm a has-been.

19:51.457 --> 19:53.457
Yeah, I guess you're right.

19:53.459 --> 19:55.693
Ah, let's make it official, eh?

19:58.797 --> 19:59.864
Aw...

20:04.803 --> 20:06.304
Oh, yeah.

20:06.306 --> 20:09.307
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

20:09.309 --> 20:11.842
Sir, may I interest you
in a French hazelnut latte

20:11.844 --> 20:13.344
and an Iggy Azalea CD?

20:13.346 --> 20:15.880
I'm not here
for three-buck coffee.

20:15.882 --> 20:18.883
I'm here to ask you
to be Duffman again.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.551
And to use
the bathroom.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.320
I don't know what you're
talking about, sir.

20:22.322 --> 20:25.156
Fine, can you tell me
where your travel mugs are?

20:25.158 --> 20:26.324
Yeah, over there.

20:26.326 --> 20:29.160
Come on, Barry,
I know it's you.

20:29.162 --> 20:31.495
Sorry, H.K., I traded
in my beer goggles

20:31.497 --> 20:33.331
for coffee-grinding
pince-nez.

20:33.333 --> 20:36.200
Are you telling me
you don't miss the big time?

20:36.202 --> 20:38.903
The girls on the side,
the corporate jet?

20:38.905 --> 20:41.339
There's talk
of an animated series.

20:41.341 --> 20:45.042
Duffman would like a job
where he could phone it in.

20:45.044 --> 20:47.345
You just called
yourself Duffman.

20:47.347 --> 20:50.514
Duffman never took off
his tights!

20:50.516 --> 20:52.183
Let's go, girls!

20:52.185 --> 20:53.684
But we're
managers here.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.586
They learned the register
better than me!

20:55.588 --> 20:57.388
Oh, yeah!

20:57.390 --> 21:00.424
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH
access.wgbh.org

21:02.694 --> 21:05.863
I see it as kind of a-a triumph
of-of doing your work

21:05.865 --> 21:07.865
from that very pure place

21:07.867 --> 21:12.770
of-of just doing stuff
that you, uh, personally enjoy.

21:57.916 --> 21:59.984
Shh!
