00:15.750 --> 00:17.516

in there! Open up!

33 david to central
requesting immediate backup.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.099
Possible homicide suspect.

00:34.101 --> 00:35.501
White female, brown hair,

00:35.503 --> 00:37.236
Fleeing down
southwest fire escape.

00:42.675 --> 00:45.110
stop her!

00:58.591 --> 01:00.759
Ahh!

01:02.262 --> 01:04.296
- Excuse me? What are you doing?
- Nobody move!

01:04.298 --> 01:05.564
Oh, god!

01:10.070 --> 01:12.805
castle...

01:12.807 --> 01:14.740
Are you asleep?

01:14.742 --> 01:16.608
yes.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.145
Then why'd you answer me?

01:20.147 --> 01:22.081
I'm sleep-talking.

01:22.083 --> 01:24.116
Also known as somniloquy.

01:24.118 --> 01:26.552
Just ignore me.

01:26.554 --> 01:28.387
I don't know what to do.

01:28.389 --> 01:29.822
I have some ideas.

01:29.824 --> 01:32.257
no, castle.
I'm talking about my life.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.593
I don't know what to do
about my life.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.563
I haven't been out of work
since I was 15.

01:37.565 --> 01:40.833
I cannot believe
that the f. B. I. Fired me,

01:40.835 --> 01:42.835
And I can't get my job back
at the n. Y. P. D.

01:42.837 --> 01:45.304
Because of the commissioner's
stupid hiring freeze.

01:45.306 --> 01:48.407
I might as well just apply
to become a mall cop.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.476
Ooh. You would look great
on a segway.

01:50.478 --> 01:51.777
But, you know, beckett,

01:51.779 --> 01:53.545
You don't have to decide
right away.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.147
Come on, castle.
What are you saying?

01:55.149 --> 01:58.183
What am I gonna do,
just sleep in every morning

01:58.185 --> 01:59.751
And screw around
till the phone rings?

01:59.753 --> 02:02.254
What kind of life is that?
Mine.

02:03.256 --> 02:04.356
Sorry.

02:04.358 --> 02:05.824
I just mean that
you're with me now.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.126
You don't have to work.

02:07.128 --> 02:09.193
I don't need to work?

02:09.196 --> 02:12.131
Does that mean
you're my sugar daddy?

02:12.133 --> 02:15.267
Oh. Hold on.
That didn't... Come out...

02:15.269 --> 02:17.202
Actually, I'm still
sleep-talking.

02:17.204 --> 02:18.837
I can't really be held
responsible for whatever I say.

02:18.839 --> 02:21.206
Wow.
Even when you're fighting,

02:21.208 --> 02:23.609
You two are super cute.
pi.

02:23.611 --> 02:26.912
Morning, mr. C.,
mrs. C.- To-be.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.881
Hey, uh, do you mind
if I borrow a razor?

02:28.883 --> 02:30.415
Alexis gets all fired up

02:30.417 --> 02:32.751
When I shave with the one
she uses for her legs.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.920
- Under the sink. - Under the sink.
- Yep. Cool.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.922
- Why is he still sleeping on your couch?
- I don't know.

02:36.924 --> 02:39.324
Good morning, darlings.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.160
Doesn't anyone knock?
Door was open.

02:41.162 --> 02:43.595
Don't be an old maid.
Nothing going on here

02:43.597 --> 02:46.698
That I haven't seen
and done before.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.167
So how can I help you,
mother?

02:48.169 --> 02:50.903
As you know, my studio
is being painted,

02:50.905 --> 02:54.206
So I am having
my stage combat class

02:54.208 --> 02:56.875
In the living room in...
whoo-hoo... 15 minutes,

02:56.877 --> 02:58.710
So, please, feel free
to join.

02:58.712 --> 03:01.180
Triple blade razors!
Nice, mr. C.!

03:01.182 --> 03:03.282
You know what? I think I'm gonna
sleep at my old place tonight.

03:03.284 --> 03:05.284
- I think I might join you.
- What is this, a house meeting?

03:05.286 --> 03:06.518
- No.
- No.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.420
- Captain gates is on the phone.
- Oh!

03:08.422 --> 03:10.222
She's asking for you, dad.

03:13.494 --> 03:15.260
Hello?

03:15.262 --> 03:16.495
thanks for coming,
mr. Castle.

03:16.497 --> 03:20.365
Again, I'm sorry your
reinstatement didn't work out.

03:20.367 --> 03:23.569
Yeah. Thanks.
So what do we got?

03:23.571 --> 03:27.439
Angelo vázquez, stabbed to death
in his girlfriend's apartment,

03:27.441 --> 03:29.441
And this is mr. Vázquez.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.276
And you are calling on
my expertise

03:31.278 --> 03:32.578
To unmask the killer.

03:32.580 --> 03:35.214
No. Actually, we've already
I. D.'d the suspect.

03:35.216 --> 03:36.982
She's the victim's girlfriend...
Emma riggs.

03:36.984 --> 03:39.851
How do you know it's her?
Because she fled from the scene

03:39.853 --> 03:42.221
And took hostages in
a dental office up the street.

03:42.223 --> 03:44.923
Oh, okay.
So this involves me how?

03:44.925 --> 03:47.993
Hostage negotiators have been
trying to talk to Emma,

03:47.995 --> 03:51.263
But she's demanding to speak
to only you, mr. Castle.

03:51.265 --> 03:53.432
- Me? Why me?
- We were hoping you could tell us.

03:53.434 --> 03:55.000
Is she familiar to you?

03:55.002 --> 03:57.669
Uh... I've never
seen her before.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.705
What do we know about her?
Not much so far.

03:59.707 --> 04:03.242
Emma riggs, 31, waitress,
no record...

04:03.244 --> 04:04.576
At least until now.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.278
Sergeant?

04:06.280 --> 04:08.914
This is sergeant roman from
the hostage negotiating team.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.582
richard castle
and kate beckett.

04:10.584 --> 04:11.984
Uh... Ooh.
Deputy chief.

04:11.986 --> 04:13.819
Excuse me.

04:13.821 --> 04:15.754
Mr. Castle, are you open
to talking to Emma

04:15.756 --> 04:18.257
- Over the phone?
- Yeah, of course. Anything I can do to help.

04:18.259 --> 04:19.658
So what's the situation inside?

04:19.660 --> 04:21.827
It's not ideal
for our purposes.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.528
The windows in the office
are covered,

04:23.530 --> 04:25.497
And there's only one door
leading in or out.

04:25.499 --> 04:26.965
Can't you just drill in
fiber optics?

04:26.967 --> 04:29.568
Cement's too thick.
But we have ascertained

04:29.570 --> 04:31.737
That she's taken
five hostages...

04:31.739 --> 04:34.906
The dentist...
dr. Abe kogan,

04:34.908 --> 04:36.408
His receptionist...
sue williams,

04:36.410 --> 04:38.410
Patient mickey gerhardt,

04:38.412 --> 04:41.747
And suki chung,
who's 9 years old,

04:41.749 --> 04:43.615
And suki's mother lisa.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.018
There's a 9-year-old
in there?

04:46.020 --> 04:48.520
But what if I say
the wrong thing?

04:48.522 --> 04:50.355
I'll be with you
the whole time.

04:50.357 --> 04:52.591
We'll make contact,
see how everyone's doing,

04:52.593 --> 04:54.926
Take Emma's temperature,
find out what she wants.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.428
And then we'll put a plan
together.

04:56.430 --> 04:58.964
All you have to do is talk.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.333
Well, if there's one thing
you excel at, castle,

05:01.335 --> 05:03.302
It's talking.

05:05.071 --> 05:06.938
You ready?

05:06.940 --> 05:08.674
No, but let's do this anyway.

05:14.315 --> 05:16.648
Hello. Hello, Emma.
This is Richard Castle.

05:16.650 --> 05:17.983
I heard you wanted to speak
with me.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.384
How do I know
it's really you?

05:19.386 --> 05:21.687
Uh, well, if you care
to step outside,

05:21.689 --> 05:23.822
- I'd be happy to show you
my driver's license. - Yeah.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.924
That's not gonna happen.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.326
Okay, you say
you're richard castle?

05:27.328 --> 05:28.894
You're gonna have to
prove it, all right?

05:28.896 --> 05:30.562
In the "nikki heat" series,

05:30.564 --> 05:33.598
What's rook and nikki's wine of choice?
Sancerre.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.501
In "deadly heat," what's
douglas sandmann's nickname?

05:36.503 --> 05:37.669
Bedbug doug.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.837
In "storm rising,"

05:38.839 --> 05:41.073
What's pierre dubois'
last words?

05:41.075 --> 05:42.507
Ah! Trick question.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.076
Pierre was a trappist monk.

05:44.078 --> 05:45.677
He took a vow of silence.
He never spoke.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.512
Boom! Believe it's me now,
Emma?

05:47.514 --> 05:48.980
Because I could play
richard castle trivia with you

05:48.982 --> 05:51.083
All day.
I will crush you.

05:51.085 --> 05:52.984
Okay. It's you.

05:52.986 --> 05:55.921
<i>So let me ask you a few questions.
No, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

05:55.923 --> 05:57.889
Not on the phone.
The cops are listening.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.024
So?

05:59.026 --> 06:00.826
So I don't trust them,
okay?

06:00.828 --> 06:03.128
Just come inside the dental
office and we can talk here.

06:03.130 --> 06:06.398
You've got to be kidding.
Hey! Shut up!

06:06.400 --> 06:09.501
Uh, look, Emma... we need to speak face-to-face.
Do you hear me?

06:09.503 --> 06:12.104
It is the only way.

06:12.106 --> 06:15.907
Okay, but only if you send out
suki and her mother. Deal?

06:15.909 --> 06:18.076
Deal. Be outside
in five minutes.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.748
God, castle, what the hell
were you thinking?

06:22.750 --> 06:25.050
Honestly, I didn't think
she would take the deal,

06:25.052 --> 06:26.752
But, look, she's a fan.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.487
Okay? I know my fans.
She won't hurt me.

06:28.489 --> 06:29.821
You don't know that.

06:29.823 --> 06:33.458
But I already got her to give up
a little girl and her mother.

06:33.460 --> 06:34.826
I can reach her.

06:34.828 --> 06:38.663
right? Maybe even get her
to surrender?

06:38.665 --> 06:40.699
So let me go in.

06:43.736 --> 06:46.405
The goal is to get in
and get out, you understand?

06:46.407 --> 06:49.107
Get her demands, check
the status of the hostages,

06:49.109 --> 06:50.842
And make mental notes
of where everyone is.

06:50.844 --> 06:54.980
You with me so far?
Demands, status, mental notes... got it.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.982
And if anything...
and I mean anything...

06:56.984 --> 06:59.451
Seems off, tell Emma
you have to call us.

06:59.453 --> 07:01.186
Tell her it's to make sure
that we're not gonna

07:01.188 --> 07:03.488
Do anything stupid, okay?
Okay.

07:03.490 --> 07:05.056
So we're gonna need
a code word

07:05.058 --> 07:06.925
That tells us
that you need help.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.994
What, uh,
what's your favorite food?

07:08.996 --> 07:12.731
Oh. Um... Are we talking
everyday food, or fine dining?

07:12.733 --> 07:14.566
If desserts are included...
cheeseburgers.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.902
He loves cheeseburgers.
I do enjoy a good cheeseburger.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.804
Okay.
Anything goes wrong,

07:18.806 --> 07:21.706
Call, mention cheeseburgers,
and we'll come running.

07:21.708 --> 07:23.008
Good luck in there.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.676
Thank you.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.711
cheeseburgers.

07:26.713 --> 07:29.014
Listen...

07:29.016 --> 07:30.482
I'm kinda looking forward
to spending

07:30.484 --> 07:31.983
The rest of my life
with you, so...

07:31.985 --> 07:33.118
Don't do anything stupid
in there, okay?

07:33.120 --> 07:36.755
I think I already hit
my "stupid" quota for the day.

08:08.555 --> 08:11.056
My god. It really is you.

08:11.058 --> 08:13.124
So we have a deal?

08:13.126 --> 08:15.060
come on. Come on!

08:17.563 --> 08:18.897
Let's go, come in!

08:20.834 --> 08:24.069
How you guys doing?
How the hell you think we're doing?

08:24.071 --> 08:26.905
Hey! I told you to shut up!
Okay... Emma... Emma, easy!

08:26.907 --> 08:28.907
I'm here now, all right?
So let's talk.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.675
You want to tell me
your demands?

08:30.677 --> 08:32.210
What do you mean,
demands?

08:32.212 --> 08:35.145
Uh, money, transportation
outta here?

08:35.148 --> 08:36.982
No, no, I-I don't...
I don't want any of that.

08:36.984 --> 08:39.251
Okay, then what do you want?

08:39.253 --> 08:41.086
<i>You. I just...
I just want you.</i>

08:42.087 --> 08:43.288
You want me?

08:43.289 --> 08:45.023
my boyfriend is dead.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.725
And I know
what it looks like.

08:46.727 --> 08:49.027
I do. I know it.
It looks like I killed him.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.029
But I didn't kill him.
I didn't.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.965
Shut up!
Emma, please.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.267
Stay calm.

08:55.269 --> 08:58.236
I know what you're
capable of,

08:58.238 --> 09:00.105
Richard castle,

09:00.107 --> 09:02.073
How you solve murders.

09:02.075 --> 09:06.144
You want demands? Okay.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.813
I want you to prove
my innocence.

09:18.760 --> 09:22.761
- So she wants you to prove her innocence?
- Right.

09:22.763 --> 09:23.962
So I hate to break it
to you,

09:23.964 --> 09:25.230
But I don't think this
is going to be

09:25.232 --> 09:27.966
A traditional
hostage negotiation.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.234
Why you?

09:29.236 --> 09:31.102
She's read all my books,
all those articles

09:31.104 --> 09:33.171
About you and I
working homicides together.

09:33.173 --> 09:34.973
So she's your number-one fan

09:34.975 --> 09:36.308
And this is some sort
of hail mary?

09:36.310 --> 09:39.010
Pretty much. So look,
I think we should...

09:39.012 --> 09:40.145
Don't tell them
anything else.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.313
Why?

09:41.315 --> 09:42.881
Because... They're cops.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.616
Are you okay in there,
mr. Castle?

09:44.618 --> 09:47.185
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just...
I'm just gonna talk to her,

09:47.187 --> 09:49.187
And then I'll call you back.
Are you sure?

09:49.189 --> 09:51.122
Yes. No cheeseburgers.

09:51.124 --> 09:54.292
I repeat...
no cheeseburgers.

09:57.163 --> 09:58.930
Cutting down on red meat.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.933
So what do we do now?
we wait.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.134
but I...

10:03.136 --> 10:04.603
But what?

10:04.605 --> 10:07.238
Sir?
Excuse me. Yeah.

10:10.643 --> 10:12.677
What are you thinking?

10:12.679 --> 10:16.247
- Sir, are you sure that this
woman doesn't have a record? - Why?

10:16.249 --> 10:19.117
Because she seems to have
a deep mistrust of the police.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.652
Well, obviously,
there's more to it

10:20.654 --> 10:24.122
Look, I know I'm not
on the job anymore, but...

10:24.124 --> 10:25.357
You want to work
the crime scene.

10:25.359 --> 10:27.792
It can't hurt to have
an extra pair of eyes.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.961
And the more we find out
about Emma,

10:29.963 --> 10:31.630
The better chance we'll have
of getting castle

10:31.632 --> 10:33.064
And the hostages...
go.

10:39.271 --> 10:40.705
all right, Emma.

10:40.707 --> 10:44.109
So... You didn't kill
your boyfriend.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.244
Let's figure out who did.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.246
As you know, all my stories
start in the same place...

10:48.248 --> 10:50.982
In the beginning.
So tell me what happened.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.251
I got home late last night.
Why did you get home late?

10:53.253 --> 10:57.255
Well, after work, I-I...
I, um, I bought a dress.

10:57.257 --> 11:00.025
Because today's
my birthday. Um...

11:00.027 --> 11:03.795
Angelo was, uh, was gonna take
me out to dinner tonight.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.930
He worked out some sort
of surprise.

11:05.932 --> 11:08.166
Said it'd be a birthday I'd
never forget, so...

11:08.168 --> 11:10.035
Any idea
what the surprise was?

11:10.037 --> 11:12.771
A marriage proposal.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.873
At least I was...
that's what I was hoping.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.207
That's why I bought the dress,

11:16.209 --> 11:17.409
Even though I couldn't
afford it.

11:17.411 --> 11:19.678
Just stupid, huh?

11:19.680 --> 11:21.846
No. Not at all.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.115
So you have your dress,
and...

11:24.117 --> 11:25.850
When I got home, I, um,

11:25.852 --> 11:28.253
I poured my nightly
two fingers of scotch.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.789
Scotch girl? Me, too.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.023
Boy.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.825
And then what happened?

11:35.695 --> 11:37.762
when I woke up
in the morning, I...

11:40.333 --> 11:42.867
I found angelo on the floor,

11:42.869 --> 11:44.269
Dead.

11:44.271 --> 11:47.772
There was so much blood.
It was...

11:51.143 --> 11:53.244
But I don't... I don't...
I don't know what happened.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.313
I, um... I don't even know

11:55.315 --> 11:57.882
Why angelo was at my apartment
in the first place.

11:57.884 --> 12:00.118
Well, what did you do?
I- I panicked.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.253
Tried to get out of there,
and the...

12:02.255 --> 12:04.322
The cops came, and...

12:06.226 --> 12:11.763
Yeah, holding us at gunpoint.
Talk about a psycho girlfriend.

12:11.765 --> 12:13.998
- What did you say?!
- Are you trying to get us killed?

12:14.000 --> 12:15.400
Okay, okay. Emma, relax.

12:15.402 --> 12:18.103
Ignore him. Just focus
on me, all right?

12:18.105 --> 12:19.938
Did angelo have a key
to your place?

12:19.940 --> 12:23.041
But you didn't make any plans
for him to come over last night?

12:23.043 --> 12:24.476
No.

12:24.478 --> 12:26.478
How were things going
in the relationship?

12:26.480 --> 12:28.480
No problems?
Mnh-mnh. None.

12:28.482 --> 12:30.849
how much scotch
did you have?

12:30.851 --> 12:32.150
One glass.
The... the two fingers.

12:32.152 --> 12:33.518
Okay.

12:35.054 --> 12:37.122
I'm gonna need you to walk
me through this again.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.396
Girl, what are you
doing here?

12:45.398 --> 12:47.398
Uh, captain gates
said that I could come.

12:47.400 --> 12:51.269
Shouldn't you be off looking
at wedding venues or something?

12:51.271 --> 12:53.104
No, we haven't even
set a date.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.106
We're just trying to enjoy
our engagement.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.841
Why is everyone trying
to rush us?

12:56.843 --> 12:58.843
Think you're being rushed now,
wait until after the wedding.

12:58.845 --> 13:00.845
Not ten minutes from the altar,
they'll all be like,

13:00.847 --> 13:02.180
"when are you two
having a baby?"

13:02.182 --> 13:04.182
Bro, your wife's hormonal
because she's pregnant.

13:04.184 --> 13:05.917
What's your excuse?

13:05.919 --> 13:08.186
So I take it this is
Emma's boyfriend?

13:08.188 --> 13:10.922
He was, until she stabbed him
three times with a knife...

13:10.924 --> 13:12.257
From the kitchen
butcher block.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.792
Emma's claiming
that she's innocent.

13:13.794 --> 13:15.493
Is there any chance
that someone else did this?

13:15.495 --> 13:16.861
No foreign fibers or prints.

13:16.863 --> 13:18.163
All evidence is pointing
towards Emma.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.331
Any ideas on motive?
Oh, yeah.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.800
This is angelo's cell phone.

13:21.802 --> 13:24.269
Check out the text history
between him and Emma.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.471
She was accusing him of having
an affair with some chick

13:26.473 --> 13:27.939
Up in scarsdale.

13:27.941 --> 13:29.340
And we found this
in angelo's pocket.

13:29.342 --> 13:31.843
"s. H. Off saw mill river
parkway."

13:31.845 --> 13:34.312
Saw mill river parkway
is the way to scarsdale

13:34.314 --> 13:36.114
From the city.
"s. H." could be

13:36.116 --> 13:38.283
The initials of the lady
he was seeing on the side.

13:38.285 --> 13:39.417
A- and listen to this...

13:39.419 --> 13:42.487
Emma texts angelo last night
at 9:47

13:42.489 --> 13:45.590
Saying she's drunk, lonely,
and wants to see him.

13:45.592 --> 13:48.026
And here is an empty bottle
of scotch.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.295
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, this is
a booty call gone wrong.</i>

13:50.297 --> 13:54.199
Then why isn't she asking
for a flight out of the country?

13:54.201 --> 13:56.568
Why is she insisting
that she's innocent?

13:56.570 --> 13:59.404
Uh, maybe because she's crazy.
I found Emma's prescriptions...

13:59.406 --> 14:02.207
Clonazepam
and aripiprazole.

14:02.209 --> 14:03.842
Lanie, aren't those
antipsychotics?

14:03.844 --> 14:05.910
One is, the other one's
for mood disorders.

14:05.912 --> 14:07.612
Hey, you know, if Emma
stopped taking her meds,

14:07.614 --> 14:09.380
She could have had
a psychotic break.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.382
Which means she wouldn't
remember what she did.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.985
We have to warn castle.
Beckett, relax.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.386
He's just on the phone
with the woman.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.055
No. He went in.

14:18.290 --> 14:20.992
Uh-huh.

14:20.994 --> 14:24.162
Okay. Let me call you back.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.164
Did detective beckett
find anything?

14:26.166 --> 14:29.234
Emma, I can't help you
if you're not honest with me.

14:29.236 --> 14:30.869
But I have been honest.

14:30.871 --> 14:33.404
You said everything between
you and angelo was all right.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.006
Yeah, it was.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.241
So you didn't suspect him
of cheating?

14:40.113 --> 14:43.648
No, it... it's just that he
kept going up to scarsdale

14:43.650 --> 14:45.216
Without saying why.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.252
I- I'm sure it was nothing.
Are you?

14:47.254 --> 14:51.155
Or could it be that you
wanted to confront him?

14:51.157 --> 14:54.559
And maybe that's why you
texted angelo last night

14:54.561 --> 14:57.295
And invited him over.
What are you talking about?

14:57.297 --> 14:59.230
Look at your phone, Emma.

15:04.303 --> 15:06.571
Wait, I don't...

15:06.573 --> 15:08.940
No, I don't remember
writing these texts.

15:08.942 --> 15:10.942
Just because you don't remember
doesn't mean you didn't.

15:10.944 --> 15:13.411
Just like you only remember
having one glass of scotch.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.079
But what if you had more?

15:15.081 --> 15:18.383
They found your scotch bottle,
Emma. It was empty.

15:18.385 --> 15:21.185
I- I didn't finish
the bottle.

15:21.187 --> 15:23.354
- Maybe you did, and you just can't remember.
- That is ridiculous!

15:23.356 --> 15:26.224
Uh, um, a-actually,
it's not.

15:26.226 --> 15:28.393
If someone's had
too much to drink,

15:28.395 --> 15:30.628
They can suffer what's called
an en bloc blackout.

15:30.630 --> 15:33.398
It prevents the brain
from creating new memories.

15:33.400 --> 15:37.168
Emma, you wanted me...

15:37.170 --> 15:39.237
To uncover the truth.

15:44.176 --> 15:46.177
No.

15:46.179 --> 15:50.181
Please don't tell me that
you don't believe me.

15:50.183 --> 15:53.017
I didn't kill angelo,
okay?

15:53.019 --> 15:55.053
I mean, I-I wanted
to marry him.

15:55.055 --> 15:57.322
I wouldn't do this!

15:58.724 --> 16:00.625
Oh, god.

16:03.095 --> 16:05.330
god... Did I? I...

16:05.332 --> 16:07.665
What if I did?
I don't...

16:07.667 --> 16:09.701
Huh.

16:09.703 --> 16:11.069
What?

16:11.071 --> 16:12.370
How do you text "love you"?

16:12.372 --> 16:14.105
What do you mean?

16:14.107 --> 16:16.207
When you write "love you,"
how do you spell it?

16:16.209 --> 16:19.010
Do a sideways heart
and the letter "u."

16:19.012 --> 16:21.079
Right, except for last night,

16:21.081 --> 16:23.281
When you just spelled it out...
"love you."

16:23.283 --> 16:25.483
No. Mnh-mnh.
I never spell it out.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.318
And the voice in those texts
from last night...

16:27.320 --> 16:29.287
It's... it's different
from the others.

16:29.289 --> 16:31.255
As if somebody else
wrote them?

16:31.257 --> 16:32.557
Maybe. I don't know.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.025
Well, if I didn't write these,
that means

16:34.027 --> 16:36.094
That somebody else did,
right?

16:36.096 --> 16:38.296
Which means the killer
used my phone!

16:44.737 --> 16:46.337
You have to dust this
for prints.

16:46.339 --> 16:49.273
Come on. Come on.
You have to find the killer.

16:49.275 --> 16:51.075
- Wait, what?
- You're not leaving us, are you?

16:51.077 --> 16:53.378
No. I-I'm gonna
get you outta here.

16:53.380 --> 16:54.712
Like hell you are.
Look,

16:54.714 --> 16:57.081
If you or the cops
aren't gonna do anything,

16:57.083 --> 17:01.786
What are you waiting for?
Come on! Just go, okay?

17:01.788 --> 17:05.723
Mickey, don't do anything.
Please.

17:16.336 --> 17:17.535
castle!

17:21.374 --> 17:23.708
Mr. Castle, what happened?
What is going on in there?

17:23.710 --> 17:25.309
We got problems.

17:25.310 --> 17:28.479
Emma is unstable,
to say the least.

17:28.481 --> 17:30.515
But that's not the worst of it.
There's a hostage in there...

17:30.517 --> 17:32.083
He's seen "die hard"
too many times.

17:32.085 --> 17:35.253
- And there's something else
I think you need to know. - What's that?

17:36.622 --> 17:39.624
Emma might actually be
telling the truth.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.092
The truth about what?

17:41.094 --> 17:43.261
Beckett, I think she's
being framed for murder.

17:47.667 --> 17:51.069
What if someone else
wrote those texts

17:51.071 --> 17:52.837
And this is all just
an elaborate frame-up,

17:52.839 --> 17:55.807
Syntax, bro? You're gonna
base Emma's innocence

17:55.809 --> 17:57.508
On how she writes
her texts?

17:57.510 --> 17:59.343
I'm just saying,
it's possible.

17:59.345 --> 18:02.747
Look, if we found
d. N. A. Or prints

18:02.749 --> 18:05.516
Or fibers at the crime scene,
maybe.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.685
Sully, we get any usable prints
off Emma's cell phone?

18:07.687 --> 18:10.388
How could someone else
have pulled this off?

18:10.390 --> 18:12.557
To use her phone
without her knowing,

18:12.559 --> 18:14.092
Emma would have had to have been
unconscious,

18:14.094 --> 18:16.227
So someone could have
knocked her out.

18:16.229 --> 18:17.762
She has a scotch every night.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.497
Someone could have
dosed her bottle.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.232
Or maybe she's just
some crazed fan,

18:21.234 --> 18:23.334
Like kathy bates
in "misery."

18:23.336 --> 18:26.871
You should be happy you didn't
get hobbled. Right?

18:29.241 --> 18:30.808
Okay. This is
your investigation.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.443
Keep running the case on Emma.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.845
But, captain, I'm...
let me finish.

18:33.847 --> 18:35.680
Look, mr. Castle,
over the years,

18:35.682 --> 18:37.548
I have learned not to discount
your little theories,

18:37.550 --> 18:39.517
No matter how fanciful.

18:39.519 --> 18:43.154
So why don't you and beckett
work with detective sully,

18:43.156 --> 18:44.455
And let's see if there's
something to this?

18:44.457 --> 18:46.691
Thank you, sir.
thank you.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.893
So, where do we start?

18:48.895 --> 18:52.797
By looking into our victim...
angelo vázquez.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.899
Everything here
tells the same story.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.901
Angelo was a decent guy.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.903
Ten years ago,
after some petty b&es,

18:58.905 --> 19:03.508
He volunteered with at-risk
youth, he was well-liked.

19:03.510 --> 19:05.910
He had been recently laid off
from his mechanic's job,

19:05.912 --> 19:09.247
There's nothing that explains
who killed him or why,

19:09.249 --> 19:10.581
Other than Emma.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.817
Castle, you're forgetting
about scarsdale.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.352
You think Emma's suspicious
are true,

19:14.354 --> 19:15.686
That he was having an affair?

19:15.688 --> 19:17.321
That some woman in scarsdale
killed him?

19:17.323 --> 19:20.191
Well, something was going on
in scarsdale. Look at this.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.859
Three nights ago,

19:21.861 --> 19:25.930
- A resident complained
about angelo's car. - Why?

19:27.266 --> 19:29.667
How does sully find anything
on this desk?

19:29.669 --> 19:32.937
I think that was once a bagel.
Okay, you know what?

19:32.939 --> 19:36.807
a scarsdale resident
on overlook road

19:36.809 --> 19:39.243
Reported angelo's license plate
to the police.

19:39.245 --> 19:43.181
He said the driver spent
two hours drinking coffee

19:43.183 --> 19:45.449
Alone in his car.

19:45.451 --> 19:47.185
Two hours drinking
coffee alone

19:47.187 --> 19:48.586
Doesn't sound like
much of an affair.

19:48.588 --> 19:50.488
Yeah, but what was angelo
up to?

19:50.490 --> 19:52.924
beckett.

19:52.926 --> 19:54.659
Hey, it's sully.

19:54.661 --> 19:57.495
There was nothing of interest
at angelo's apartment,

19:57.497 --> 20:00.464
But his car
is a whole other matter.

20:00.466 --> 20:03.868
Get this.
Angelo had a duffel bag

20:03.870 --> 20:06.938
Filled with tools
of the burglar variety,

20:06.940 --> 20:10.908
A floor plan to what looks
like a house...

20:10.910 --> 20:15.246
And a manual for
a ramco-4700 alarm system.

20:15.248 --> 20:17.748
I don't think he was installing
home security systems.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.450
Angelo was out of work.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.686
Do you think he went back
to committing b&es?

20:21.688 --> 20:24.622
I only know one person with
the answer to that question.

20:39.705 --> 20:41.872
okay, here's the plan.

20:41.874 --> 20:44.508
Doc, act like you're
having a seizure.

20:44.510 --> 20:45.977
Excuse me?

20:45.979 --> 20:47.878
And then, sue, you squirt
out a few tears,

20:47.880 --> 20:49.347
Beg Emma to help him.

20:49.349 --> 20:52.283
When she does, boom,
I take her out, we end this,

20:52.285 --> 20:53.818
Then we meet at the bar
around the corner,

20:53.820 --> 20:55.319
And the first round's
on me.

20:55.321 --> 20:56.754
Are you out of your mind?

20:56.756 --> 20:58.322
that is
the dumbest plan ever.

20:58.324 --> 20:59.624
Fine, I'll do it by myself.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.999
it's castle.

21:08.001 --> 21:10.601
hey.

21:10.603 --> 21:13.037
And I brought doughnuts.
hey.

21:13.039 --> 21:15.339
Um... Gluten-free?

21:15.341 --> 21:18.009
Dude, they're doughnuts.
Either you're in or you're out.

21:18.011 --> 21:20.678
you find out anything?

21:20.680 --> 21:23.781
Emma, what do you know about
angelo's trips to scarsdale?

21:23.783 --> 21:29.687
Is it possible he was there
casing a house for a burglary?

21:29.689 --> 21:32.356
Wha... no.
That's ridiculous.

21:32.358 --> 21:34.992
Do the initials "s. H."
mean anything to you?

21:34.994 --> 21:36.994
Uh...

21:36.996 --> 21:38.996
Could someone from angelo's
criminal past have come back?

21:38.998 --> 21:41.732
Look, that was all petty stuff
when he was a kid, that's all.

21:41.734 --> 21:42.967
Yes, but he wasn't a kid
anymore.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.736
The stakes were higher.
He was out of work.

21:45.738 --> 21:48.372
He wanted to surprise you
on your birthday,

21:48.374 --> 21:50.007
Maybe propose.

21:50.009 --> 21:52.476
What if he got into trouble
trying to make that happen?

22:01.887 --> 22:03.688
Yo, beckett.

22:03.690 --> 22:04.989
Where's castle?

22:04.991 --> 22:06.490
He's not in there, is he?

22:06.492 --> 22:08.426
Why?
We found something.

22:08.428 --> 22:09.794
Something about Emma.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.765
Emma.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.901
Let these people go.

22:16.903 --> 22:19.036
It worked.

22:19.038 --> 22:20.905
You got my attention.
There's hope now.

22:20.907 --> 22:23.040
no.

22:23.042 --> 22:26.510
Unh-unh. Not until my name
is cleared. No.

22:29.415 --> 22:30.848
It's beckett.
Go.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.050
hey, beckett.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.885
Do not react to what
I'm about to tell you.

22:34.887 --> 22:35.953
Okay.

22:35.955 --> 22:37.755
Emma has been playing you

22:37.757 --> 22:38.923
This whole time.

22:38.925 --> 22:42.927
Angelo is not her first victim.
She's done this before.

22:42.929 --> 22:44.428
She has
a sealed juvie record

22:44.430 --> 22:47.431
Under her original name...
Emma jones.

22:47.433 --> 22:50.868
When she was 16, she killed
her foster brother...

22:50.870 --> 22:52.036
Billy koss.

22:52.038 --> 22:53.437
Apparently, she got drunk,

22:53.439 --> 22:55.606
Lured him into
their basement,

22:55.608 --> 22:57.007
And then stabbed him
with a knife.

22:57.009 --> 22:58.876
Well, that's a coincidence.

22:58.878 --> 23:00.578
Also known as an m. O.
Castle,

23:00.580 --> 23:02.880
It's exactly what she did
to angelo.

23:02.882 --> 23:05.883
She's unstable. You need
to get out of there... now.

23:07.854 --> 23:10.488
Don't say another word.

23:10.490 --> 23:11.922
Hang up.

23:11.924 --> 23:15.593
She told you about billy koss,
didn't she?

23:20.832 --> 23:22.733
Look, Emma...
back up!

23:22.735 --> 23:25.903
I am not a murderer.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.671
Says the lady pointing
a gun at me.

23:27.673 --> 23:29.807
You weren't supposed to find out
about billy koss.

23:29.809 --> 23:32.443
I mean, what is the point
of a sealed record

23:32.445 --> 23:34.745
When the cops can open it
whenever they feel like it?!

23:34.747 --> 23:36.113
I'm sure they got
a subpoena first.

23:36.115 --> 23:37.782
And I'm sure they all
had a laugh

23:37.784 --> 23:39.884
Off all the adjectives
describing me, right?

23:39.886 --> 23:44.588
Manic. Bipolar.
Violent. Murderer!

23:44.590 --> 23:45.723
Well, not to be a stickler,

23:45.725 --> 23:47.658
But "murderer"
isn't an adjective.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.827
I'm not an idiot.
Sorry.

23:49.829 --> 23:51.595
I just get sarcastic
when I'm nervous.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.130
That's not what I was
talking about.

23:53.132 --> 23:54.865
Look, I knew what you
were going to think.

23:54.867 --> 23:58.836
Two deaths happening
the exact same way?

23:58.838 --> 24:02.006
That's why I didn't tell you.
But I am innocent!

24:02.008 --> 24:03.974
I didn't kill angelo.
I didn't!

24:03.976 --> 24:07.077
If that's true, Emma,
and you want me to help you,

24:07.079 --> 24:10.648
You have to tell me
everything.

24:21.561 --> 24:24.662
When I was 16,

24:24.664 --> 24:26.831
I was sent to this
foster home.

24:26.833 --> 24:29.066
Twin orphans lived there...

24:29.068 --> 24:31.235
The koss brothers.

24:31.237 --> 24:33.237
Warren and billy.

24:33.239 --> 24:34.772
What happened?

24:34.774 --> 24:37.908
Those two bullied me
for weeks.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.146
Foster parents were in it
for the money,

24:42.148 --> 24:43.914
So they didn't care.

24:43.916 --> 24:46.717
But then one day,
the twins

24:46.719 --> 24:49.787
Were nice to me
all of a sudden.

24:49.789 --> 24:52.756
and I thought they, um...

24:52.758 --> 24:56.794
I thought they'd finally
accepted me, you know?

24:56.796 --> 24:58.963
So we...

24:58.965 --> 25:00.965
We went down
to the basement.

25:00.967 --> 25:04.635
We drank schnapps,
and then...

25:06.572 --> 25:07.938
Billy pulled a knife on me.

25:07.940 --> 25:11.108
I was just trying
to stop him.

25:12.210 --> 25:14.512
I didn't mean to...

25:16.281 --> 25:18.849
And then
when the cops came...

25:18.851 --> 25:21.685
warren lied.

25:21.687 --> 25:23.654
He said I pulled the knife
on them,

25:23.656 --> 25:25.689
And they just... they just
took him at his word.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.124
Which is why you hate cops.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.228
But I didn't kill angelo.

25:31.230 --> 25:33.964
I didn't.
You have to believe me.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.968
I do, Emma.
I believe you.

25:37.970 --> 25:41.839
But why were angelo
and billy's deaths

25:41.841 --> 25:43.941
Staged exactly the same way?

25:43.943 --> 25:46.043
I have no idea.
I don't know.

25:46.045 --> 25:48.212
It has to be someone who knew
something about your past.

25:48.214 --> 25:52.783
Yeah. I mean, I guess so.
But who?

25:52.785 --> 25:54.785
Warren koss.

25:54.787 --> 25:57.588
What better way to get revenge
for the death of his brother

25:57.590 --> 25:59.657
Than by killing
your boyfriend

25:59.659 --> 26:00.958
- And pinning the murder on you?
- No, it's not warren.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.960
warren's doing eight years

26:02.962 --> 26:04.695
Up in sing sing for assault.

26:04.697 --> 26:06.964
You kept track of him?
Of course.

26:06.966 --> 26:08.966
He's the reason
why I changed my name.

26:08.968 --> 26:10.701
I mean, I have been
really careful

26:10.703 --> 26:12.002
About staying off
of warren's radar

26:12.004 --> 26:13.837
Ever since he testified
against me in court.

26:13.839 --> 26:15.839
He almost got me thrown
in prison for life.

26:15.841 --> 26:17.775
If it wasn't for the sisters

26:17.777 --> 26:19.310
Of st. Helena's
home for children, I...

26:19.312 --> 26:21.345
Whoa, whoa. Go back.

26:21.347 --> 26:23.847
- St. Helena's home for children...
where is that? - In Yonkers.

26:23.849 --> 26:26.717
The note we found
in angelo's jacket

26:26.719 --> 26:30.054
Said "s. H. Off saw mill
river parkway."

26:30.056 --> 26:31.889
"s. H." has to be
st. Helena's.

26:31.891 --> 26:35.159
Yonkers is off
saw mill river parkway.

26:35.161 --> 26:37.661
Somehow st. Helena's
is connected to this.

26:37.663 --> 26:41.699
But I... how? I mean, I haven't
been back there in years.

26:41.701 --> 26:44.702
I spoke with sister frances
at st. Helena's.

26:44.704 --> 26:46.804
She said that there was
a break-in three nights ago.

26:46.806 --> 26:49.740
and they have
a ramco-4700 alarm.

26:49.742 --> 26:53.377
Ramco-4700. That's the manual
angelo had in his car.

26:53.379 --> 26:54.979
Why would he break into
my old orphanage?

26:54.981 --> 26:57.214
We have a pretty good idea.

26:57.216 --> 26:58.816
Sister frances checked
the records room.

26:58.818 --> 27:00.985
And Emma's sealed foster care
file is missing.

27:00.987 --> 27:02.853
Looks like angelo stole it.

27:02.855 --> 27:05.789
- Why would he do that?
- To find out something about you?

27:05.791 --> 27:07.358
No, I already told him
everything about me.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.696
oh, god.

27:12.698 --> 27:14.398
Guys,
let me call you back.

27:16.802 --> 27:19.670
You figured it out?

27:19.672 --> 27:22.373
I was
given up for adoption

27:22.375 --> 27:27.711
Angelo knew I always wanted to
find out where I came from.

27:27.713 --> 27:30.414
And that file had
your adoption papers

27:30.416 --> 27:32.716
With your birth parents'
names.

27:32.718 --> 27:34.218
I tried to get 'em
in the past,

27:34.220 --> 27:36.754
But... They were sealed.

27:36.756 --> 27:38.889
That's the surprise angelo was
gonna give you tonight...

27:38.891 --> 27:41.225
at your birthday dinner.

27:41.227 --> 27:43.927
The gift of knowing
who your real parents are.

27:51.836 --> 27:52.870
Watch out.

27:52.872 --> 27:54.872
Stop it! Stop it!
No! Listen...

27:54.874 --> 27:57.274
Oh!

27:57.276 --> 27:58.275
Mickey!
Aah!

27:58.277 --> 27:59.443
Drop it!

28:01.447 --> 28:05.115
All units, full breach!
Go, go, go!

28:05.117 --> 28:09.019
God! Oh, my god!
I just killed richard castle!

28:09.021 --> 28:10.854
- Oh! Oh!
- N. Y. P. D.! Let me see your hands!

28:10.856 --> 28:13.123
It was her!
It was her! It was her!

28:13.125 --> 28:15.025
Get him up! Get him up!

28:15.027 --> 28:17.294
- We're gonna need an e. M. T. Right away!
Let's go! - Castle!

28:17.296 --> 28:19.730
Castle!

28:19.732 --> 28:21.298
Cheeseburgers!

28:21.300 --> 28:23.200
cheeseburgers.

28:24.437 --> 28:27.037
Ow! Ow, it worked.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.806
She dotted the "I"!
Yeah!

28:28.808 --> 28:30.874
Aah! Chest! Ooh!

28:30.876 --> 28:33.210
- That hurts.
- Sorry. Yeah, well, getting hit by a projectile

28:33.212 --> 28:35.713
Traveling at 1,000 feet
per second's gonna sting a bit.

28:35.715 --> 28:37.114
Yeah, I think that's
gonna leave a mark.

28:37.116 --> 28:38.716
All that matters is
you're okay now.

28:38.718 --> 28:40.284
Oh, I'm better
than okay, beckett.

28:40.286 --> 28:42.720
I know
who the killer is.

28:45.090 --> 28:47.057
She shot you in the chest,

28:47.059 --> 28:50.260
<i>No, she shot me in the chest,
and now I know she's innocent.</i>

28:50.262 --> 28:52.362
Thank you.
Don't you see?

28:52.364 --> 28:53.964
Just like that vest
protected me,

28:53.966 --> 28:55.232
Emma's adoption papers...

28:55.234 --> 28:56.800
They're protecting
the killer.

28:56.802 --> 28:59.803
<i>You know that made
no sense, right?</i>

28:59.805 --> 29:02.106
I- I think
what castle is suggesting

29:02.108 --> 29:04.108
Is that one
of Emma's birth parents

29:04.110 --> 29:05.242
May be behind
all of this.

29:05.244 --> 29:07.945
That's why angelo
took those records...

29:07.947 --> 29:10.247
To find her birth parents.
What if he found one of them?

29:10.249 --> 29:13.117
Perhaps living on overlook road
in scarsdale.

29:13.119 --> 29:16.787
But what if that birth parent
didn't want to be found?

29:16.789 --> 29:18.789
What if Emma learning
the truth was a threat somehow?

29:18.791 --> 29:21.358
castle,
that's just speculation.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.260
And if you're right,
we'll probably never know.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.362
The killer's most likely
destroyed the records by now.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.531
Unless... Angelo hid them.

29:27.533 --> 29:29.533
I mean, they were supposed
to be a surprise.

29:29.535 --> 29:32.202
Head back to angelo's place.
We need to search it again.

29:35.373 --> 29:37.441
You are aware
that you don't actually

29:37.443 --> 29:40.277
Work here anymore, right?

29:40.279 --> 29:42.279
I'm sorry. Old habits.

29:42.281 --> 29:45.315
Okay. Uh, we'll grab sully...

29:45.317 --> 29:47.518
Go check again,
just in case.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.353
But not because
you asked me to.

29:49.355 --> 29:51.121
Okay. 'cause I was actually
on my way to...

29:51.123 --> 29:55.125
Okay. So let's suppose it is
one of Emma's birth parents.

29:55.127 --> 29:57.394
If angelo's murder
was a setup,

29:57.396 --> 29:59.797
Then how would they know
how to stage it?

29:59.799 --> 30:01.198
I mean, they gave her up
for adoption,

30:01.200 --> 30:04.001
So how would they know about
Emma's violent history?

30:04.003 --> 30:05.969
Newspaper articles.
No. I checked.

30:05.971 --> 30:07.371
Because she was a minor,
her name was withheld.

30:07.373 --> 30:09.306
So then our killer
had to have had access

30:09.308 --> 30:11.208
To Emma's sealed
juvie records.

30:11.210 --> 30:13.443
And for that,
you need a subpoena.

30:15.181 --> 30:18.382
looks like someone
skipped that step.

30:18.384 --> 30:20.918
Emma's sealed records were
opened three days ago.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.386
By who?

30:23.388 --> 30:25.589
Ah. Julian carter?

30:25.591 --> 30:28.425
Hi. I'm detective ryan.
This is kate beckett.

30:28.427 --> 30:30.060
We're from the 12th.
Do you have a second

30:30.062 --> 30:31.395
To help us out
with something?

30:31.397 --> 30:34.598
The system tagged you
for opening a file

30:34.600 --> 30:36.200
Of an Emma jones.

30:36.202 --> 30:37.434
Yeah. That's my job.

30:37.436 --> 30:40.137
I open files,
I close files.

30:40.139 --> 30:42.506
Right now I'm filing files.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.375
Is there a problem?

30:45.377 --> 30:48.345
I'm afraid so.
You see, it was a juvie file,

30:48.347 --> 30:50.614
And you didn't have the court's
permission to unseal it.

30:50.616 --> 30:54.985
Well, I... Sometimes forget
to log out of my computer,

30:54.987 --> 30:56.887
So maybe somebody...
just stop it.

30:56.889 --> 30:58.889
You've already lost your job.
Now the only question is

30:58.891 --> 31:00.424
Whether you're losing
your freedom, too,

31:00.426 --> 31:02.993
Because I'm about two seconds
away from arresting you

31:02.995 --> 31:05.128
For accessory to murder.
W- wait. Wait. Hold on.

31:05.130 --> 31:08.365
You better start talking
before he pulls out his cuffs.

31:08.367 --> 31:10.033
Hmm.

31:10.035 --> 31:12.035
Okay. Okay. Okay!

31:12.037 --> 31:14.104
From time to time,

31:14.106 --> 31:15.873
I slip information
to a lawyer.

31:15.875 --> 31:17.441
What kind of information?

31:17.443 --> 31:19.376
Rap sheets, witness statements,
things like that.

31:19.378 --> 31:20.878
What about with Emma?

31:20.880 --> 31:22.312
Three days ago,
the lawyer called,

31:22.314 --> 31:24.314
Said a client wanted
all the information

31:24.316 --> 31:26.283
That the police had
on Emma riggs.

31:26.285 --> 31:28.518
What for?
He didn't say.

31:28.520 --> 31:31.154
But when I told him that
Emma had a juvie file

31:31.156 --> 31:32.389
Under a different last name,

31:32.391 --> 31:34.424
He paid me an extra grand
to unseal it.

31:35.526 --> 31:37.361
What's the name
of this lawyer?

31:37.363 --> 31:39.463
No, I'm having breakfast
with the judge...

31:39.465 --> 31:40.898
Hi, mr. Vance.
I'm detective ryan.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.599
Uh, he's a friend
of a friend.

31:43.969 --> 31:46.670
yeah. And then...

31:46.672 --> 31:48.405
He's gonna need
to call you back.

31:48.407 --> 31:51.108
What is your problem?
Actually, mr. Vance,

31:51.110 --> 31:52.442
I'm not the one
with the problem.

31:52.444 --> 31:55.212
You are.
Okay. I'm listening.

31:55.214 --> 31:58.282
On behalf of a client,
you paid to have

31:58.284 --> 32:00.984
Emma riggs' juvenile records
unsealed.

32:00.986 --> 32:03.687
Buying secured police files
is illegal...

32:03.689 --> 32:06.523
And grounds for disbarment.
I would never do that.

32:06.525 --> 32:10.160
Really? Because I have
an n. Y. P. D. Civilian employee

32:10.162 --> 32:12.362
Who begs to differ.
He's willing to testify to it.

32:12.364 --> 32:16.300
Detective, I'm not
some ambulance chaser.

32:16.302 --> 32:19.236
I'm a respected attorney
at kirkpatrick & young.

32:19.238 --> 32:22.005
So unless you have any real
proof of those claims,

32:22.007 --> 32:23.974
Good luck getting any court
to take the word

32:23.976 --> 32:27.411
Of a disgraced
civilian employee.

32:27.413 --> 32:31.281
Mr. Vance, you have a client
who's mixed up in a homicide.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.684
By withholding their name,
you're obstructing justice.

32:33.686 --> 32:37.421
Even if I wanted to, I can't
disclose my client's name.

32:37.423 --> 32:40.424
As you're well aware, that falls
under privileged information.

32:43.661 --> 32:47.130
Hey.

32:47.132 --> 32:48.498
Oh, don't tell me we struck out
on the lawyer.

32:48.500 --> 32:49.967
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

32:49.969 --> 32:52.202
So what do we do now?

32:52.204 --> 32:54.137
Come on, you guys.
If we don't figure this out,

32:54.139 --> 32:56.506
Emma is going away
for life.

32:56.508 --> 32:59.443
What about her scotch bottle?
Did the lab report come back?

32:59.445 --> 33:01.378
Lanie just texted.
There's no evidence

33:01.380 --> 33:03.313
Of any drugs or sedatives.

33:03.315 --> 33:05.148
I'm sorry. It looks like
we're dead in the water.

33:05.150 --> 33:07.451
No. Far from it. Guess what
we found in angelo's apartment.

33:07.453 --> 33:09.486
Angelo's birthday present
to Emma.

33:09.488 --> 33:13.190
- I missed it before because it was wrapped.
- You wanna guess what's inside?

33:13.192 --> 33:15.559
I was... I was gonna have them guess.
oh, I didn't...

33:15.561 --> 33:17.661
According to these
adoption papers,

33:17.663 --> 33:21.298
Emma's birth mother was
a woman named stacy moore.

33:21.300 --> 33:23.033
She died ten years ago.

33:23.035 --> 33:25.035
And her birth father is...

33:28.439 --> 33:29.673
Espo, is this right?

33:29.675 --> 33:32.042
It's right. Emma's dad
is aaron stokes.

33:32.044 --> 33:34.311
The real estate developer?
Yeah.

33:34.313 --> 33:35.746
He's considering taking a run
at governor.

33:35.748 --> 33:37.381
Yeah, and I wonder
how the governor's mansion

33:37.383 --> 33:39.750
Compares to his big house
on overlook road in scarsdale.

33:39.752 --> 33:41.451
And let me guess.
He's a client

33:41.453 --> 33:44.287
Of kirkpatrick & young.
That's right.

33:44.289 --> 33:48.592
Is gonna be trading in
his big house for the...

33:48.594 --> 33:50.394
Big... House.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.538
You ordered aaron stokes
in for questioning?

34:01.540 --> 34:05.242
You told us to build our case,
and mr. Stokes is where it went.

34:05.244 --> 34:07.110
This is a very powerful man

34:07.112 --> 34:08.612
Who happens to be
golfing buddies

34:08.614 --> 34:10.647
With the police
commissioner!

34:10.649 --> 34:12.815
So because he has a standing
tee time with your boss,

34:12.818 --> 34:13.784
He gets away with murder?

34:13.786 --> 34:15.652
I'm handling
the interview.

34:15.654 --> 34:17.621
What...
what? No. Sir!

34:17.623 --> 34:19.222
This is our case.
Yes,

34:19.224 --> 34:21.725
And it'll be your jobs
if there's any blowback.

34:21.726 --> 34:24.161
I am not gonna have you two
risk your careers.

34:24.163 --> 34:25.728
Captain...

34:25.731 --> 34:27.764
I don't have a career
to risk.

34:27.766 --> 34:29.800
How about I back you up
in there?

34:30.735 --> 34:32.101
Okay.

34:32.103 --> 34:34.804
Captain, I, too,
have no career to risk.

34:34.806 --> 34:38.074
Why don't I...
maybe I should...

34:38.077 --> 34:39.743
You know what I'm gonna do,
is I'm gonna stay here.

34:39.745 --> 34:41.445
I think you guys
got this handled.

34:48.686 --> 34:50.520
why am I here?

34:50.522 --> 34:52.121
Do you know who I am?

34:52.123 --> 34:54.791
Why do you think you're
in this room, mr. Stokes?

34:54.793 --> 34:57.294
A room with
no recording devices.

34:57.296 --> 34:59.196
Okay.

34:59.198 --> 35:00.730
So what do you want
from me?

35:00.732 --> 35:05.135
We know that while you
were married to your wife...

35:05.137 --> 35:06.870
you were having an affair

35:06.872 --> 35:09.606
With stacy moore
that produced a baby girl.

35:09.608 --> 35:11.108
Her name is Emma riggs.

35:11.110 --> 35:13.276
Have you been in touch
with her, mr. Stokes?

35:15.880 --> 35:18.849
No, I've... I've never
seen her before.

35:18.851 --> 35:22.119
What about her boyfriend?
Angelo vázquez.

35:22.121 --> 35:23.220
Have you been in touch
with him?

35:23.222 --> 35:24.754
No. Is Emma in trouble?

35:24.756 --> 35:26.456
well, you could say that.

35:26.458 --> 35:29.392
She's under arrest
for murdering angelo.

35:29.394 --> 35:31.361
But don't worry. We know
that she's being framed

35:31.363 --> 35:32.629
For that murder.

35:32.631 --> 35:36.133
Did you know that angelo
stole her adoption records

35:36.135 --> 35:38.468
From st. Helena's
home for children?

35:38.470 --> 35:40.270
St. Helena's?

35:40.272 --> 35:43.540
Stacy and I went there
to make the arrangements.

35:43.542 --> 35:46.710
What was I supposed to do,
tell my wife

35:46.712 --> 35:50.514
I was having a baby
with another woman?

35:50.516 --> 35:53.750
31 years,
and not a day has gone by

35:53.752 --> 35:57.521
Where I haven't said to myself,
"I should try to find her."

35:57.523 --> 36:00.524
And not a day has gone by
where I haven't then said,

36:00.526 --> 36:02.759
"no, no...

36:02.761 --> 36:04.528
Maybe tomorrow."

36:06.864 --> 36:09.432
It's her birthday.

36:09.434 --> 36:11.268
You still haven't answered
my question.

36:11.270 --> 36:14.538
Did you know that angelo
stole those adoption records?

36:14.540 --> 36:16.740
What are you two getting at?

36:16.742 --> 36:19.309
Look at it from
our perspective, mr. Stokes.

36:19.311 --> 36:21.578
The last thing you need
right now

36:21.580 --> 36:24.915
Is for some love child to emerge
and destroy your marriage

36:24.917 --> 36:26.783
And any chance of running
for public office.

36:26.785 --> 36:29.953
Are you suggesting that I had
something to do with this?

36:29.955 --> 36:32.923
We know that angelo showed up
at your home three days ago.

36:32.925 --> 36:34.424
Did you meet him then?

36:34.426 --> 36:36.393
I was in chicago
three days ago.

36:36.395 --> 36:38.762
If that is true,
then why did you pay

36:38.764 --> 36:40.664
To unseal
Emma's juvenile record?

36:40.666 --> 36:42.832
Where are you getting this?

36:42.834 --> 36:44.868
From your lawyer,
mr. Stokes.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.836
What lawyer?

36:46.838 --> 36:48.838
Okay, this is
borderline police harassment.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.774
If you continue to hold me
here against my will,

36:50.776 --> 36:52.309
You either need to...
just wait.

36:52.311 --> 36:53.777
Before you get all
lawyer-y,

36:53.779 --> 36:55.946
We already know
everything.

36:55.948 --> 36:57.981
Starting with you being
aaron stokes' son-in-law.

36:57.983 --> 36:59.683
So?

36:59.685 --> 37:01.451
So when your in-laws were
out of town,

37:01.453 --> 37:02.953
You were staying
in their scarsdale house.

37:02.955 --> 37:05.622
<i>So when angelo went
to go look for mr. Stokes,</i>

37:05.624 --> 37:06.957
He met you instead.

37:06.959 --> 37:08.792
That's when he told you
the story

37:08.794 --> 37:11.628
About mr. Stokes'
long-lost daughter Emma.

37:11.630 --> 37:13.763
L- look. Yes,

37:13.765 --> 37:15.665
I stayed at
my father-in-law's house,

37:15.667 --> 37:17.901
But I've never seen this guy
before in my life.

37:17.903 --> 37:20.604
Are you sure? Because...

37:20.606 --> 37:22.772
Well, this is
security footage...

37:22.774 --> 37:25.308
From inside
angelo's apartment building

37:25.310 --> 37:26.843
Taken about an hour
after his death

37:26.845 --> 37:28.278
Down at Emma's place.

37:28.280 --> 37:31.881
Now wait a minute.
Who... Who is that?

37:31.883 --> 37:34.818
That...

37:34.820 --> 37:36.620
That's you.

37:36.622 --> 37:37.787
Using angelo's keys
to get in.

37:37.789 --> 37:39.556
How'd you get those?

37:39.558 --> 37:41.258
Now I can only think
of one reason

37:41.260 --> 37:43.827
That you'd break into
in his, uh, apartment,

37:43.829 --> 37:47.030
And that would be to find
Emma's adoption records

37:47.032 --> 37:50.000
To cover up any link
back to your family.

37:50.002 --> 37:51.735
now according to this video,

37:51.737 --> 37:53.370
You were inside
that apartment

37:53.372 --> 37:55.605
Searching for
a good two hours.

37:55.607 --> 37:56.840
Damn...

37:56.842 --> 37:58.875
You didn't think
to look...

37:58.877 --> 38:01.945
At the wrapped gift
for Emma,

38:01.947 --> 38:02.812
Did you?

38:02.814 --> 38:03.980
Oops.

38:03.982 --> 38:05.982
Her adoption records.

38:05.984 --> 38:07.684
Up until then,
your plan was going perfectly.

38:07.686 --> 38:10.453
You spiked Emma's scotch bottle
with knockout drops

38:10.455 --> 38:11.821
And you swapped it out
for an empty one.

38:11.823 --> 38:13.290
Th-that was pretty clever.

38:13.292 --> 38:15.392
But not so clever to throw
the dosed bottle away

38:15.394 --> 38:16.926
At your house.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.828
Yeah. We found the bottle
in your recycle bin.

38:18.830 --> 38:21.698
It tested positive
for chloral hydrate.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.066
Oops again.

38:23.068 --> 38:24.934
All of this
is circumstantial.

38:24.936 --> 38:27.470
I mean, what could possibly
be my motive?

38:27.472 --> 38:28.938
Oh, your father-in-law
helped us out with that one.

38:28.940 --> 38:30.840
Your law firm represents
the stokeses.

38:30.842 --> 38:32.909
Now you knew that they were
about to transfer

38:32.911 --> 38:34.444
A majority of their wealth
into a trust

38:34.446 --> 38:37.514
For their daughter...
your wife.

38:37.516 --> 38:39.449
And you didn't want
some little orphan annie

38:39.451 --> 38:41.818
Coming around,
making a claim for half.

38:41.820 --> 38:44.954
That's when you decided to kill
the one man who knew the truth

38:44.956 --> 38:46.890
And frame it
on the unknowing heir.

38:48.659 --> 38:50.827
There's just one thing that
we're not so sure about.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.962
Are you gonna make a deal
and plea to murder?

38:52.964 --> 38:55.065
Or you gonna take
your chances in court?

38:55.067 --> 38:56.733
Do lawyers have lawyers?

38:59.970 --> 39:01.771
Emma?

39:01.773 --> 39:04.441
He confessed.

39:04.443 --> 39:06.509
It's over.

39:11.449 --> 39:12.916
Bullet.

39:12.918 --> 39:15.618
Sorry. Sorry.

39:15.620 --> 39:18.955
Um, I hope you don't mind,

39:18.957 --> 39:20.824
But someone wants
to meet you.

39:35.840 --> 39:37.674
I'm aaron.

39:38.776 --> 39:39.876
Emma.

39:41.545 --> 39:43.847
Happy birthday.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.828
Well...

39:58.830 --> 40:03.500
Oh, it was nice to be back,
even if it was just for one day.

40:06.138 --> 40:10.006
Mr. Stokes.
What can we do for you?

40:11.142 --> 40:14.444
Earlier, you two were
only doing your jobs,

40:14.446 --> 40:19.682
But I assumed the worst,
and I'm... Sorry.

40:21.619 --> 40:23.853
Well, how are you doing?
Not really sure.

40:23.855 --> 40:25.789
But I do know this.

40:25.791 --> 40:28.091
I am going to be there
for Emma this time.

40:28.093 --> 40:29.993
No matter what happens
at her trial,

40:29.995 --> 40:31.995
She's not going to be alone.

40:31.997 --> 40:34.831
Well, I should leave
the both of you to your work.

40:34.833 --> 40:37.700
Captain, thank you
for everything.

40:37.702 --> 40:39.169
You, too, detective.

40:39.171 --> 40:40.804
Uh, actually,
I'm not a detective, but...

40:40.806 --> 40:42.539
You're not?

40:42.541 --> 40:45.608
Well, she should be,
but your golfing buddy's

40:45.610 --> 40:47.911
Budget cuts
have gotten in the way.

40:47.913 --> 40:49.946
Really?

40:50.881 --> 40:52.982
Wow.

40:52.984 --> 40:55.051
And to think
you boys mocked me

40:55.053 --> 40:57.220
When I had this made
four years ago.

40:57.222 --> 40:59.088
I think I'll have it framed.

40:59.090 --> 41:00.690
Hey, what does it say about
your writing

41:00.692 --> 41:01.891
When your number-one fan
tries to kill you?

41:01.893 --> 41:03.593
That was an accident.

41:03.595 --> 41:05.061
Been one inch higher,
it would have been a tragedy.

41:05.063 --> 41:07.697
But on the bright side,
your autographed copies

41:07.699 --> 41:09.833
Of "deadly heat" would be
worth way more.

41:09.835 --> 41:11.868
Not funny, castle.
Little bit funny.

41:11.870 --> 41:15.538
You know, beckett, despite
your fiancé's near-death,

41:15.540 --> 41:18.074
Today was fun.
Yeah. We miss working with you.

41:18.076 --> 41:20.109
Good.

41:20.111 --> 41:21.611
'cause I'm back.

41:21.613 --> 41:23.813
<i>What? What hap... what...</i>

41:23.815 --> 41:25.815
What about the commissioner's
hiring freeze?

41:25.817 --> 41:28.785
Mr. Stokes had a conversation
with the commissioner,

41:28.787 --> 41:30.687
And apparently he found
some money.

41:30.689 --> 41:32.622
<i>So you are back.</i>

41:32.624 --> 41:35.225
Which means... I'm back.

41:35.227 --> 41:36.659
Am... am I back?

41:37.862 --> 41:41.831
Yes. Captain gates said that you
can serve as a consultant again.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.867
But how does that...
because now we're in a...

41:43.869 --> 41:47.937
- To keep it a secret?
- Uh, well, the commissioner is aware of it

41:47.939 --> 41:50.640
And said that it's okay as long
as we behave professionally

41:50.642 --> 41:52.609
In the workplace,
and captain gates said that

41:52.611 --> 41:54.844
That can be
our engagement gift.

41:54.846 --> 41:57.247
Hey, everybody, listen up.

41:57.249 --> 41:58.848
Beckett is back!

42:01.019 --> 42:02.719
beckett's back!

42:04.155 --> 42:06.890
And tonight at the old haunt,
drinks are on the house!

42:06.892 --> 42:08.224
all right!

42:09.159 --> 42:11.561
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

42:11.563 --> 42:16.497
Uh... whoa! Actually, no, we can't,
not here. We gotta be professional.

42:16.599 --> 42:19.234
Uh, well, you know,
I'm not officially back until tomorrow.

42:19.236 --> 42:21.303
I see.
