01:35.177 --> 01:36.576
Amanda!

01:39.981 --> 01:41.949
Amanda, turn that down!

01:42.117 --> 01:43.584
Jeez.

01:48.890 --> 01:51.723
Danny, are you still on that thing?
We've gotta go, honey.

01:51.893 --> 01:54.453
We gotta get rolling here.

01:54.629 --> 01:56.460
Did your sister come in here
to help you with anything?

01:56.631 --> 01:57.655
Uh-huh.

01:57.833 --> 01:59.528
Your father's gonna be here
in five minutes.

01:59.701 --> 02:01.307
Please get motivated.
Get dressed.

02:01.670 --> 02:03.365
Amanda. Amanda?

02:04.739 --> 02:06.832
- I can't even hear myself think in here.
- What?

02:08.210 --> 02:09.234
How can I help you...

02:09.411 --> 02:12.938
...get ready to leave this house in
time for your father if you won't help?

02:13.181 --> 02:15.172
You can do it, Mom. I believe in you.

02:15.350 --> 02:18.148
I have a ferry to catch
and I've only got two hands.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.447
- Count them: one, two.
- She can count too.

02:20.856 --> 02:22.414
That's enough, smart mouth.

02:22.591 --> 02:24.752
What is that on your stomach?
Go wash it off.

02:24.926 --> 02:26.291
- Are these clean?
- No.

02:26.461 --> 02:29.555
Actually, I can't wash it off,
because it's a real tattoo.

02:29.731 --> 02:31.028
- What?
- Whoa.

02:31.199 --> 02:33.258
You got a tattoo
without asking permission?

02:33.435 --> 02:35.426
- Wait till Dad sees.
- You're an idiot.

02:35.604 --> 02:36.935
- Please!
- No, you are!

02:37.105 --> 02:38.470
- You are!
- Out!

02:38.640 --> 02:41.803
- Get out of my room!
- Stupid idiot!

03:13.575 --> 03:15.702
I don't wanna go with Dad.

03:16.077 --> 03:17.567
Oh, honey...

03:17.746 --> 03:20.806
It's Orlando, Dan.
There's lots to do, it'll be fun.

03:20.982 --> 03:22.449
No, it won't.

03:22.617 --> 03:25.643
Okay, so it won't.
But you know what, we'll talk every day.

03:25.820 --> 03:26.878
Okay.

03:27.055 --> 03:28.920
You're being so brave.

03:29.090 --> 03:30.114
Mm.

03:31.593 --> 03:34.494
Amanda, your father's here.
You better cover that thing up...

03:34.663 --> 03:36.597
...unless you wanna deal
with your father.

03:36.765 --> 03:38.357
You look tired.

03:38.533 --> 03:40.501
Yeah. I'm sure I do.

03:48.543 --> 03:51.273
- Who wants to have some fun around here?
- Daddy.

03:51.446 --> 03:52.640
Ah. Oh.

03:52.814 --> 03:54.509
- Go on.
- Come on. How you doing?

03:54.683 --> 03:57.015
Come on, give me a big hug. Ade.

03:59.087 --> 04:00.486
Jack.

04:07.996 --> 04:10.931
- Danny's medicine's in his backpack.
- He takes them every night.

04:11.099 --> 04:13.966
- She's got a report due.
- On Magellan. Yeah, she and I talked.

04:14.135 --> 04:16.625
Look, Ade, between you and me,
we got it covered.

04:16.805 --> 04:19.535
I've gotta get on the road.
Shouldn't you be leaving?

04:19.708 --> 04:21.437
- Sit down.
- I've got a ferry to catch.

04:21.610 --> 04:23.305
- For a minute, please.
- Ahem.

04:23.478 --> 04:24.706
Yeah?

04:29.918 --> 04:31.715
I wanna come home.

04:33.321 --> 04:34.345
What?

04:34.522 --> 04:36.956
I don't know how I could have
been so stupid.

04:37.125 --> 04:39.491
I know any chance
that you could forgive me...

04:39.661 --> 04:41.652
- Forgive you?
...is out the window.

04:41.830 --> 04:42.888
- Only...
- Only what?

04:43.064 --> 04:45.658
I want a chance.
I'm not saying that I deserve it.

04:45.834 --> 04:48.166
- Jack, I can't. Please.
- I'll try like anything.

04:48.336 --> 04:50.497
Adrienne. I love you.

04:50.672 --> 04:52.663
I love you so much.

04:52.841 --> 04:54.172
I know what I've lost here...

04:54.342 --> 04:56.902
...and I'll do anything in my power
to get it back.

04:58.380 --> 05:02.874
Jack, you can't just walk in here
and do this to me out of the blue.

05:03.184 --> 05:05.379
Because it didn't work out
with what's-her-name?

05:05.553 --> 05:06.918
We ought to be together.

05:08.156 --> 05:12.923
Now, Adrienne, you know that.
All you've gotta do is look at the children.

05:13.094 --> 05:16.257
- Come on. Come to Orlando with us.
- What?

05:16.431 --> 05:19.662
We'll put the kids on the dumb rides.
It'll give us time to be alone.

05:19.834 --> 05:21.358
Oh, Jack, I can't, I can't.

05:21.536 --> 05:23.970
I told Jean that I would help her,
you know.

05:24.139 --> 05:27.870
- I'm going to do what I said I would do.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

05:28.209 --> 05:30.006
When I get back, we'll talk?

05:30.178 --> 05:31.770
Yeah, okay.

05:31.946 --> 05:33.777
We'll talk when you get back.

05:33.948 --> 05:35.916
Jack, okay, we'll talk then.

05:39.521 --> 05:41.318
Hey, guys.

05:57.939 --> 06:00.237
Oh, Dr. Flanner.
I thought we'd missed you.

06:00.408 --> 06:03.605
No, I...
Tell them I hope they're happy here.

07:52.954 --> 07:54.922
You remember where I keep
the extra towels?

07:55.089 --> 07:56.989
I know where everything is. I'll be fine.

07:57.158 --> 07:59.422
You have to wait for the hot water
to burble up.

07:59.594 --> 08:00.822
You reminded me twice.

08:00.995 --> 08:02.690
And I got an emergency generator...

08:02.864 --> 08:05.697
...in case the storm turns into anything
and you lose power.

08:06.100 --> 08:08.898
It's never been turned on before,
so I wouldn't count on it.

08:09.070 --> 08:12.972
If it gets stuck, kick it hard.
And that goes for most things around here.

08:14.042 --> 08:16.010
Jack wants to come back.

08:17.679 --> 08:20.443
Uh-huh. I wouldn't worry
about the storm, though.

08:20.615 --> 08:23.140
Weatherman's always predicting this,
predicting that.

08:23.318 --> 08:25.286
- What do you think?
- I'm not gonna say...

08:25.453 --> 08:29.150
...because if I do and you say
you're gonna let him come back to you...

08:29.324 --> 08:30.655
You gonna let him come back?

08:31.559 --> 08:33.186
I don't know.

08:34.195 --> 08:35.423
Uh-huh.

08:35.630 --> 08:37.860
The storm boards
are underneath the house.

08:38.032 --> 08:39.294
I'll figure it all out.

08:39.467 --> 08:41.628
If they issue a warning,
just get out of here.

08:41.803 --> 08:44.067
This place has been through
so many hurricanes...

08:44.239 --> 08:47.072
...I wouldn't even worry about it.
Won't feel a thing.

08:49.143 --> 08:50.974
So, what happened?

08:51.145 --> 08:54.376
Jack get tired of that Miss Flip-Curl
he was reptiling around with?

08:54.549 --> 08:55.607
Your best friend?

08:55.783 --> 08:57.307
She was not my friend.

08:57.485 --> 08:59.953
She was in my car pool.
You're my best friend.

09:00.488 --> 09:02.251
Don't play me.

09:03.892 --> 09:07.384
What? The kids want things
back to normal, you know?

09:07.562 --> 09:09.826
Doing it for the children?
Which reminds me...

09:09.998 --> 09:13.490
...when are you gonna send me
Miss Amanda so I can out-attitude her...

09:13.668 --> 09:15.033
...and send her home right?

09:16.404 --> 09:19.635
I wish you would. I wish you would.

09:21.009 --> 09:23.477
Where was that man? Hmm?

09:24.979 --> 09:27.140
Where was Jack when your father died?

09:28.149 --> 09:30.879
Your father,
who was so good to him too.

09:33.321 --> 09:35.221
Anyway...

09:35.790 --> 09:37.257
When do the guests arrive?

09:37.425 --> 09:39.450
Guest, meaning one. Tonight.

09:39.627 --> 09:41.527
I thought about
closing this place down...

09:41.696 --> 09:46.099
...but when a man calls from Raleigh
and he offers to pay double the price...

09:46.267 --> 09:49.964
...as my grandmama used to say,
"Count your blessings, keep on stepping."

09:50.138 --> 09:54.097
Which is exactly what you need to do
when it comes to Reptile Jack.

09:54.842 --> 09:58.710
You should have married that hippie
potter with the great ass back in school.

09:58.880 --> 10:02.475
Hell, I should have married
the hippie potter with the great ass.

10:02.650 --> 10:04.880
- Love you.
- Be safe.

10:05.053 --> 10:07.487
Have fun for the both of us.

10:08.222 --> 10:10.315
Have fun yourself.

11:41.783 --> 11:43.580
Hello?

12:02.270 --> 12:04.295
Anybody here?

12:12.013 --> 12:13.640
Hello?

12:15.049 --> 12:16.539
Oh.

12:17.585 --> 12:20.019
Ah, you must be Mr. Flanner.

12:20.588 --> 12:22.021
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

12:22.190 --> 12:25.023
Ah. The wind just came up.

12:25.860 --> 12:26.884
Ah.

12:28.963 --> 12:30.692
Let's get you signed in.

12:31.032 --> 12:33.296
You must have taken the 3:30 ferry.
You're early.

12:33.468 --> 12:35.299
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

12:36.003 --> 12:38.028
Four nights, leaving Tuesday?

12:38.206 --> 12:40.367
Pretty early. I've got a flight to catch.

12:40.541 --> 12:42.907
If you don't mind signing this, please.

12:43.077 --> 12:46.240
Yeah, you may have heard some talk
about bad weather. Um...

12:46.848 --> 12:48.475
Radio said only 50-percent chance...

12:48.649 --> 12:51.243
Yeah, I heard something about that.
It doesn't matter.

12:51.419 --> 12:54.183
People come here even in winter
for the beach, you know.

12:54.355 --> 12:55.549
It doesn't matter.

12:57.125 --> 12:59.525
Oh, if you don't mind,
please fill out the home address.

12:59.694 --> 13:02.686
- Jean always asks for home address.
- I thought you were Jean.

13:03.064 --> 13:04.691
Oh, Jean and I are old friends.

13:04.866 --> 13:08.029
She had to work in Miami,
so I'm standing in for her.

13:11.873 --> 13:16.037
Look, I'm gonna leave this home address
blank, if you don't mind.

13:17.712 --> 13:19.202
Okay.

13:21.015 --> 13:22.505
Okay.

13:26.654 --> 13:28.519
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

13:31.058 --> 13:32.753
It's called the Blue Room.

13:34.695 --> 13:39.132
Oh, the hot water,
you may have to give it a little time...

13:39.300 --> 13:40.699
...to burble up at you.

13:41.102 --> 13:45.095
If you need any extra blankets, towels,
anything, don't hesitate to ask.

13:45.573 --> 13:49.009
After all, you are the only guest.

13:49.610 --> 13:51.874
If you're lucky, you'll see bankers.

13:52.046 --> 13:54.981
That's the wild ponies
that were descendents of the horses...

13:55.149 --> 14:00.314
...that were shipwrecked here hundreds
of years ago. They swam miles to shore.

14:00.822 --> 14:03.120
Well, uh, dinner's at 8.

14:03.291 --> 14:06.385
Or 7, 7:30 if you'd prefer.
Whatever time you'd like because...

14:06.561 --> 14:08.756
I'm the only guest. Seven-thirty's great.

14:09.630 --> 14:10.824
Yes.

14:12.633 --> 14:15.898
- Can I get you anything else?
- No, I think I've got everything.

14:16.070 --> 14:17.401
Okay.

14:57.311 --> 14:59.142
Oh, Jean.

15:07.688 --> 15:09.679
<i>Tightly lock and secure</i>
<i>doors and windows...</i>

15:09.857 --> 15:13.315
<i>... and bring all deck furniture,</i>
<i>anything which may be blown away, inside.</i>

15:13.494 --> 15:15.223
<i>And now for those listeners...</i>

15:15.396 --> 15:17.125
<i>... not familiar with the region</i>
<i>the Outer Banks.</i>

15:17.298 --> 15:20.290
<i>They are a strip of islands</i>
<i>which run along the Carolina coastline...</i>

15:20.468 --> 15:23.995
I don't know. I don't care.
I just want it there. I want it.

15:24.171 --> 15:27.436
I want the equipment there when I arrive.
That's the whole point...

15:50.231 --> 15:51.960
<i>You're listening to WROH...</i>

15:52.133 --> 15:55.193
<i>... the music of Rodanthe,</i>
<i>where yesterday lives today.</i>

16:08.983 --> 16:11.144
Unless you'd prefer white?

16:12.286 --> 16:16.916
No, no, red is fine. Red is good.

16:19.961 --> 16:22.589
- I'll come back with your salad.
- Okay.

16:49.357 --> 16:52.884
Dinah, Dinah Washington. She's so great.

17:07.808 --> 17:09.275
Something wrong with your table?

17:09.844 --> 17:11.868
Absolutely not.

17:12.213 --> 17:14.146
Didn't wanna eat alone.

17:17.752 --> 17:19.013
Oh.

17:19.185 --> 17:20.517
Okay.

17:23.758 --> 17:26.488
- Here's your salad.
- Thank you.

17:26.660 --> 17:28.594
Thank you.

17:30.831 --> 17:32.298
I'm hungry.

17:32.466 --> 17:34.366
It's probably the air.

17:34.869 --> 17:37.463
- What?
- Makes you hungry.

17:38.773 --> 17:42.334
I've been coming here for years
with my husband, Jack, and the kids.

17:42.810 --> 17:45.643
But just the kids, lately.

17:45.813 --> 17:48.509
Yeah, well,
I never got home for dinner either.

17:48.682 --> 17:51.549
Oh, Jack made it home
for dinner, all right.

17:51.719 --> 17:53.414
When he, uh...

17:54.722 --> 17:56.849
- When he was there.
- Thank you.

17:57.558 --> 17:59.150
We, um...

18:00.795 --> 18:03.059
We might be getting back together.

18:03.898 --> 18:08.494
I'm sorry, I just... It's weird not
knowing if you're married or not.

18:08.669 --> 18:11.467
It's all right.
I don't know where I live.

18:16.977 --> 18:19.207
Well, you didn't come here for the beach.

18:22.483 --> 18:25.816
No, I came here to talk to somebody.

18:29.156 --> 18:31.215
- More wine?
- Yeah, sure.

18:35.496 --> 18:36.554
Oh, can I?

18:36.730 --> 18:38.960
- You're not having any?
- No.

18:39.133 --> 18:41.397
Well, why not?

18:44.071 --> 18:47.131
So if you're not Jean, who are you?

18:48.843 --> 18:51.710
I'm sorry, I'm Adrienne Willis.

18:51.879 --> 18:55.474
- Adrienne.
- Adrienne Taylor.

18:55.649 --> 18:58.482
I was Adrienne Taylor, and...

18:59.386 --> 19:00.614
Adrienne.

19:03.591 --> 19:06.287
Well, uh, do you have kids?

19:07.628 --> 19:11.064
Yeah. Yeah, I have a son.

19:11.732 --> 19:12.756
He's a doctor.

19:12.933 --> 19:14.525
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:14.702 --> 19:16.602
Well, you must have done
something right.

19:16.770 --> 19:19.705
Yeah, well, not me, my wife.

19:19.874 --> 19:21.432
Ex-wife.

19:22.877 --> 19:24.902
I can't take any credit.

19:47.835 --> 19:50.099
Oh, that's great. Thank you.

19:50.538 --> 19:52.062
- What is that?
- That glow?

19:52.239 --> 19:54.104
- Yeah.
- It's called Teach's Light.

19:54.808 --> 19:59.040
Captain Teach, the pirate, swore he'd put
his enemies to an everlasting fire.

19:59.213 --> 20:01.943
That glow's supposed to be
their bodies burning.

20:02.116 --> 20:04.710
It's not considered a good omen.

20:05.586 --> 20:07.486
Thanks for warning me.

20:09.390 --> 20:12.689
It's from a folktale
my dad used to tell me.

20:13.894 --> 20:15.987
He loved telling stories.

20:16.931 --> 20:18.592
And he had a beautiful eye.

20:18.899 --> 20:21.891
It's because of him
that I went to art school.

20:22.403 --> 20:25.133
- So you're an artist.
- I used to be.

20:26.774 --> 20:28.241
Yeah.

20:29.043 --> 20:31.170
He died a few months ago.

20:31.879 --> 20:33.437
I'm sorry.

20:34.248 --> 20:36.808
That's just been my year, you know.

20:37.551 --> 20:39.485
Dad died and...

20:40.120 --> 20:42.281
...my husband...

20:42.556 --> 20:44.524
...and my daughter decided
she hated me.

20:46.594 --> 20:49.495
I don't know why I thought
things were gonna get easier.

20:50.264 --> 20:52.960
Yeah, we all did.

21:01.275 --> 21:03.266
I think I'm gonna go in now.

21:04.912 --> 21:06.903
- I think I'll go for a walk.
- Okay.

21:09.083 --> 21:11.017
- Good night.
- Night.

21:28.902 --> 21:32.736
Danny still up?
I told him that we'd talk every night.

21:33.474 --> 21:38.707
Aw. Well, don't wake him.
Did he do his inhaler before he fell asleep?

21:39.346 --> 21:41.871
Jack, I told you.

21:43.017 --> 21:46.817
You're gonna have to go in there,
wake him up and give him his medicine.

21:56.830 --> 22:01.392
Yes, I have been thinking about it.
Of course I've been thinking about it.

22:01.568 --> 22:03.195
I'm not ready to talk about it.

22:07.841 --> 22:12.574
Jack, please, let's have that
conversation when I get back, like I said.

22:12.746 --> 22:14.407
Can I just say good night to Amanda?

22:14.581 --> 22:17.209
Okay. Okay. Hold on.

22:18.686 --> 22:21.314
<i>No. No.</i>

22:21.889 --> 22:25.086
Ade, she's out, iPod on and everything.
She's asleep.

22:25.259 --> 22:26.283
Really?

22:26.460 --> 22:29.395
Well, let Miss Amanda know
that I know she's not asleep...

22:29.563 --> 22:31.394
...and that I love her very, very much.

22:31.565 --> 22:32.827
Ade, I love you.

22:33.867 --> 22:35.129
I love you.

22:35.302 --> 22:38.362
Let's just say good night. Okay?

22:39.506 --> 22:41.030
Good night.

23:04.064 --> 23:05.429
<i>Dad.</i>

23:06.266 --> 23:07.927
What happened? Are you okay?

23:08.102 --> 23:10.935
We're doctors,
we can't control everything all the time.

23:11.872 --> 23:13.772
I'm asking if you're all right.

23:13.941 --> 23:17.206
This is my last surgery.
I don't have time for this.

23:19.880 --> 23:22.280
Look after yourself.

23:26.954 --> 23:28.888
Jen, I'm...

23:37.564 --> 23:40.590
Look, your mother and I,
we're worried about you.

23:40.768 --> 23:42.793
We just wanna make sure
that you're safe.

23:42.970 --> 23:44.494
Since when?

23:44.671 --> 23:48.732
Since when is it my mother and you?
Since when is it "we"?

23:48.909 --> 23:51.070
All right. Okay.
That's not why I'm here, Mark.

23:51.245 --> 23:53.179
Why the hell are you here?

23:55.048 --> 23:56.447
Mark.

24:48.802 --> 24:51.293
- Any problems with the anesthesia?
- No problems.

24:51.472 --> 24:53.099
- Absolutely none? You sure?
- Yes.

24:54.074 --> 24:57.043
- Miles Davis again, Dr. Flanner?
- Bach today. Bach.

25:08.288 --> 25:09.721
Charge.
- Charging.

25:09.890 --> 25:11.152
Talk to me! Come on, now!

25:11.325 --> 25:13.816
Three, four, five, six...

25:13.994 --> 25:17.828
...seven, eight, nine, 10, 11...

25:31.545 --> 25:33.342
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

25:33.514 --> 25:36.176
Coffee's ready. Can I make you something
for breakfast?

25:36.350 --> 25:38.784
Um, maybe later, I gotta go into town.

26:40.614 --> 26:44.050
You looking for someone?
- Yeah. This Robert Torrelson's house?

26:44.484 --> 26:47.385
Yeah, that's my father.
You with the bank?

26:47.988 --> 26:50.422
No, I'm Paul Flanner. Is he in?

26:55.295 --> 26:57.763
What the hell do you want coming here?

26:57.931 --> 27:00.559
Your father wrote me a letter,
said he wanted to talk.

27:00.734 --> 27:03.669
- Get back in your car and go.
- I told you, he wrote me.

27:03.837 --> 27:07.500
And I told you to leave.
Nobody here has nothing to say to you.

27:07.908 --> 27:09.170
What do you think...

27:09.343 --> 27:12.904
...that you can just show up,
talk your way out of it?

27:14.681 --> 27:16.046
Now get.

27:20.554 --> 27:22.522
I'm staying at the inn.
Let him know that.

27:22.689 --> 27:24.850
- I ain't telling you again.
- Let him know.

27:49.383 --> 27:51.408
Son of a bitch.

27:51.585 --> 27:53.780
What happened?
- Where are you taking these?

27:54.454 --> 27:56.922
To the top of the stairs.
They're for the windows.

27:57.090 --> 27:58.250
Well, I can do this.

27:58.425 --> 27:59.653
I got it.

27:59.826 --> 28:01.726
- You sure?
- Yep.

28:04.531 --> 28:05.589
Damn!

28:06.066 --> 28:07.727
It's all right.

28:07.901 --> 28:10.199
Here, let me do it. I've got gloves on.

28:10.370 --> 28:12.998
- I can...
- Let me do this.

28:13.573 --> 28:15.006
Okay.

28:15.175 --> 28:18.576
I should go into town
and get some supplies.

28:34.461 --> 28:36.452
Bye.
- All right, y'all take care.

28:37.230 --> 28:38.754
- Adrienne.
- Dot.

28:38.932 --> 28:41.025
- Adrienne Willis.
- How are you?

28:41.201 --> 28:43.260
Half out of my mind, that's how I am.

28:43.437 --> 28:45.837
Getting folks stocked up
in case the storm blows in.

28:46.006 --> 28:48.531
You'd better get ready
because it's gonna hit hard.

28:48.709 --> 28:53.112
They say it's a-coming and it don't.
They say it ain't and it does.

28:53.780 --> 28:56.044
I'm not used to seeing you
so late in the year.

28:56.216 --> 28:59.652
- I'm looking after things for Jean.
- You've still got guests at the inn?

28:59.820 --> 29:01.549
Look out, because it's gonna happen.

29:01.722 --> 29:04.384
I know exactly how many cold Buds
I got back there.

29:07.227 --> 29:10.458
Hey, Dot, do you hear anything
about this family, the Torrelsons?

29:10.630 --> 29:14.464
Well, there's only Robert
and their son Charlie left.

29:14.634 --> 29:17.000
You know what happened to poor Jill.

29:17.170 --> 29:19.195
I heard something.

29:19.573 --> 29:23.441
They saved all their pennies
for some famous doctor from Raleigh.

29:23.610 --> 29:27.910
I told her not to do it, I warned her.
God rest her soul.

29:28.081 --> 29:29.912
You want some candles.

29:32.018 --> 29:35.317
Yeah, look, I wanna get out of here now.
Yeah. As soon as I can.

29:39.059 --> 29:40.617
Call me back.

29:42.162 --> 29:43.561
So you're leaving early?

29:43.730 --> 29:46.790
Yeah. Yeah, I'm trying to.
I'm thinking about it.

29:47.868 --> 29:51.429
Look, I'm sorry
I was a little spun out before.

29:52.339 --> 29:56.241
Does it have anything to do
with the Torrelsons?

29:58.044 --> 30:00.945
I'm sorry, it's a small town.

30:01.114 --> 30:02.581
What exactly did you hear?

30:02.749 --> 30:04.614
Look, you don't owe me any explanation.

30:04.785 --> 30:06.514
No, I don't. What did you hear?

30:07.888 --> 30:09.549
Huh?

30:09.723 --> 30:11.350
You wanna hear the truth?

30:19.166 --> 30:21.760
Mrs. Torrelson came to me
with a hemangioma.

30:22.602 --> 30:25.264
A cyst on her left cheek.

30:25.438 --> 30:27.633
Benign, but substantial.

30:28.341 --> 30:31.139
It was disfiguring, that was all.
It wasn't life-threatening.

30:31.311 --> 30:35.008
I have removed cysts this bad and worse,
much worse, hundreds of times.

30:35.182 --> 30:37.241
Nothing's ever gone wrong.

30:39.719 --> 30:41.619
She died on the table.

30:48.695 --> 30:50.424
The husband...

30:51.565 --> 30:54.534
...he filed a suit for wrongful death.

30:58.305 --> 31:01.035
And then he wrote me a note
and he said he wanted to talk.

31:01.208 --> 31:02.766
I thought, "Sure.

31:03.310 --> 31:06.279
Fine. One conversation,
I'll clear this whole thing up."

31:07.180 --> 31:10.445
But when I get to the house,
his son won't even let me see him.

31:11.484 --> 31:13.543
Kicks in my car.

31:14.654 --> 31:16.781
Must have been very hurtful.

31:19.860 --> 31:21.157
He was angry.

31:22.095 --> 31:23.357
I meant for you.

31:26.700 --> 31:30.864
To be held responsible
for the death of a mother.

31:43.116 --> 31:47.610
Look, if me being here
makes you feel uncomfortable, I can go.

31:53.960 --> 31:58.124
I was planning on grilling a salmon
for dinner.

32:11.411 --> 32:13.038
Sounds good.

32:15.582 --> 32:17.516
Oh, Jean, don't worry so much.

32:17.684 --> 32:20.949
Whatever I didn't find in the inn,
I bought downtown.

32:21.121 --> 32:23.487
- We're gonna be just fine.
- <i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

32:23.657 --> 32:26.751
"We"? Mm.

32:28.128 --> 32:30.289
Don't start with me.

32:30.463 --> 32:32.863
I didn't mean anything by "we," all right?

32:33.033 --> 32:34.557
Dr. Flanner and I.

32:34.968 --> 32:36.595
Doctor, is it?

32:36.770 --> 32:39.705
Listen to me.
I'm not gonna do this with you.

32:39.873 --> 32:42.239
So now we know he's rich.
But is he good-looking?

32:42.409 --> 32:45.276
I am not having this conversation
with you.

32:46.846 --> 32:48.211
That good-looking, huh?

32:49.182 --> 32:51.582
I didn't say that.
You know I didn't say that.

32:51.751 --> 32:53.412
Oh, come on.

32:53.586 --> 32:57.022
Tell me my great-grandmama's place
is doing you some good.

32:57.190 --> 33:00.921
Come on, it is, isn't it?
It is, you could tell me.

33:01.094 --> 33:03.392
Don't you have something
you're supposed to do...

33:03.563 --> 33:05.758
...like meeting dealers,
showing them your work?

33:05.932 --> 33:08.366
I am meeting and I am showing.

33:19.779 --> 33:22.043
I am giving all I got.

33:23.817 --> 33:25.375
God.

33:35.895 --> 33:38.125
- This is Miss Amanda.
- Aw.

33:38.698 --> 33:40.393
Before and after.

33:40.567 --> 33:43.297
- You see the whole story there now?
- Ha-ha-ha.

33:43.470 --> 33:45.802
She is really something else.

33:45.972 --> 33:50.409
Whatever she thinks or feels,
she will let you know.

33:51.678 --> 33:55.614
She's like her dad like that.
You don't have to second-guess her.

33:56.383 --> 33:59.750
But I do admire her for her honesty,
really I do.

33:59.919 --> 34:02.854
I don't think there's much
she admires about me lately.

34:03.023 --> 34:04.320
But that's fine.

34:04.491 --> 34:06.459
And this is my Danny.

34:07.660 --> 34:09.059
Oh.

34:09.228 --> 34:10.786
Look at him. Is he about 9?

34:10.964 --> 34:12.454
- Ten, yeah.
- Ten.

34:12.632 --> 34:14.827
He's always in his own world.

34:15.001 --> 34:17.663
I think when he grows up,
he's going to be a writer...

34:17.837 --> 34:19.327
...or philosopher...

34:19.505 --> 34:24.466
...or do something really special
with all of that solitude.

34:26.012 --> 34:28.139
- You light up when you talk about him.
- Thanks.

34:28.313 --> 34:30.110
Both your kids.

34:30.917 --> 34:33.750
I saw a picture of you with a little boy.

34:33.920 --> 34:35.911
Must be your son?

34:36.089 --> 34:37.681
Mark.

34:38.224 --> 34:42.388
He's 28 now. Believe that? My God.

34:43.596 --> 34:44.995
Yeah, he's a...

34:45.165 --> 34:47.360
He's a doctor, like his dad.

34:47.699 --> 34:49.190
Well...

34:49.369 --> 34:52.532
...I don't think he'd see it quite like that,
but he's...

34:52.705 --> 34:55.674
He heads a clinic in Ecuador,
up in the mountains.

34:55.842 --> 34:58.504
Wow. He must be doing
some important work there.

34:58.678 --> 35:00.976
I tend to think he's hiding.
Probably from me.

35:01.147 --> 35:03.581
Oh, stop. Stop.

35:03.750 --> 35:05.684
Well, when was the last time you spoke?

35:06.653 --> 35:09.816
Ah, it's been almost a year now.

35:11.991 --> 35:14.016
Yeah. Yeah.

35:14.194 --> 35:17.493
I'm sorry, I just can't imagine that.
I mean...

35:17.864 --> 35:20.958
...you know, Amanda drives me crazy...

35:21.134 --> 35:23.830
...but not talking for a year, I...

35:25.939 --> 35:28.066
He was there when the woman died.

35:30.143 --> 35:31.735
And I had...

35:31.911 --> 35:35.574
I sent the surgery nurse out there
to tell the husband...

35:35.748 --> 35:38.342
...which probably wasn't
the smartest thing to do.

35:38.518 --> 35:41.578
But I had four operations
that morning already...

35:41.754 --> 35:44.484
...and I had another patient waiting
in the next O.R.

35:45.358 --> 35:47.690
I feel like me standing around
with the husband...

35:47.861 --> 35:49.624
...was not gonna bring his wife back.

35:52.031 --> 35:53.396
Mark did not approve.

35:53.566 --> 35:57.798
I'm sure he felt it was just another
example of me making the wrong decision.

35:57.971 --> 36:03.603
Bad doctor. Bad father. Bad, bad, bad.

36:05.211 --> 36:08.544
Anyway, in a month he was gone.

36:09.415 --> 36:10.882
Hmm.

36:11.050 --> 36:13.280
I've been leaning on
a pharmaceutical company...

36:13.453 --> 36:16.616
...to send drugs and medical equipment
down there.

36:18.658 --> 36:22.754
I'm going down there for two weeks.
I'm gonna bring him back.

36:25.965 --> 36:29.867
Must be something in this wine,
I am just, "Blah, blah."

36:30.670 --> 36:32.297
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

36:32.472 --> 36:33.598
Stop.

36:41.147 --> 36:44.014
I'd like for you to come with me.

36:48.254 --> 36:49.482
Okay.

37:00.366 --> 37:02.357
All right, where are you taking me?

37:24.924 --> 37:28.792
Jean had a great-grandmother
who came here right after the Civil War.

37:28.962 --> 37:33.331
You're surrounded by the spirit-gods
that she taught Jean about.

37:33.499 --> 37:35.967
That's Yemaja.

37:42.609 --> 37:43.906
This is you, isn't it?

37:44.077 --> 37:46.375
I was in my 20s. Ha, ha.

37:50.083 --> 37:52.017
God of thunder.

37:52.185 --> 37:53.812
Not a happy guy tonight.

37:56.522 --> 37:59.252
Oh, there's Amanda. With Jean.

38:00.260 --> 38:03.957
- Jean's her godmother.
- Hmm. Oh, she's adorable.

38:07.233 --> 38:08.359
Sweet.

38:11.904 --> 38:13.201
I made that.

38:13.373 --> 38:14.931
- This? You made this?
- Yeah.

38:15.108 --> 38:16.632
- Yeah.
- Get out of here.

38:16.809 --> 38:18.936
Years ago, from driftwood.

38:19.112 --> 38:21.603
Something I learned
from the local women.

38:23.950 --> 38:29.013
They used them for special things
that they loved and wanted to keep safe.

38:29.188 --> 38:31.918
The more scarred and twisted the wood
the better...

38:32.091 --> 38:36.050
...because if you could make something
beautiful out of it, it meant that much more.

38:37.797 --> 38:39.788
What would you keep in yours?

38:42.669 --> 38:44.432
My children.

38:45.772 --> 38:47.296
And Jean.

38:47.707 --> 38:49.971
And memories of my father.

38:52.945 --> 38:54.207
Yeah.

38:55.481 --> 38:57.415
Who keeps you safe?

39:04.724 --> 39:08.353
Well, you fall in love with someone,
you know...

39:08.528 --> 39:10.655
...and you make a family...

39:12.632 --> 39:17.865
...and you become
what you think you're supposed to be.

39:24.477 --> 39:27.037
And you change
and you give up certain things.

39:29.382 --> 39:32.545
Then they look at what you've got left
and you wish you...

39:33.920 --> 39:36.548
I don't know, you just think
maybe you shouldn't have.

39:40.026 --> 39:41.493
Don't.

39:46.499 --> 39:48.262
Just don't do it anymore.

39:52.805 --> 39:54.238
Huh.

40:01.314 --> 40:04.442
Oh, my. Sorry, I forgot it was even...

40:06.452 --> 40:07.680
Oh, it's Amanda.

40:07.854 --> 40:09.185
Oh.

40:10.390 --> 40:11.857
Hi, sweetheart.

40:14.527 --> 40:18.463
I knew you were gonna have a good time.
That's great, sweetie.

40:18.631 --> 40:22.158
I'm looking at a baby picture of you
right now.

40:22.335 --> 40:23.893
How's Danny?

40:27.106 --> 40:29.734
Good, that's great.

40:31.611 --> 40:32.805
That's great, honey.

40:34.981 --> 40:38.246
Yes, I am thinking about
what your daddy asked me.

40:39.318 --> 40:42.845
That's right, thinking about it,
sweetheart, that's what I said.

40:44.123 --> 40:46.216
Amanda. Amanda. Listen to me, honey.

40:46.392 --> 40:49.520
That's something that your father and I
are deciding.

40:49.695 --> 40:52.255
It's complicated, sweetheart.
We have to talk about it.

40:52.432 --> 40:54.423
There isn't anything to talk about. Okay?

40:54.600 --> 40:57.797
<i>Dad says he loves you</i>
<i>and he wants to come back. You promised.</i>

40:57.970 --> 40:59.835
I promised? What did he tell you, honey?

41:00.006 --> 41:01.837
You said you would give him a chance.

41:02.008 --> 41:04.875
You're only thinking about what you want.
It's not fair to us.

41:05.044 --> 41:06.068
Put your father on the phone.

41:06.245 --> 41:07.678
<i>Stop picking on Mom.</i>

41:07.847 --> 41:09.508
<i>Stop being such a little mama's boy.</i>

41:09.682 --> 41:11.377
<i>Dad, Amanda called me a mama's boy.</i>

41:11.551 --> 41:13.542
I hear you're gonna have
some bad weather.

41:13.719 --> 41:15.710
Did you tell Amanda that I promised you?

41:15.888 --> 41:20.018
Don't get mad. She got ahead of herself
because she wants things to work out.

41:20.193 --> 41:22.320
I can't believe how irresponsible
you're being.

41:22.495 --> 41:25.931
You drag the children into a conversation
that you and I haven't even had?

41:26.098 --> 41:31.331
You know what? No. I covered your ass
with those kids when you left me.

41:31.504 --> 41:34.029
I don't even deserve a weekend here alone
to think...

41:34.207 --> 41:36.334
...after you've pulled a 180 on me?

41:36.509 --> 41:39.535
You say you wanna come back to me
and what am I supposed to do?

41:39.712 --> 41:42.704
Just pretend that the last seven months
didn't even happen?

41:45.885 --> 41:47.352
You okay?

42:33.733 --> 42:37.066
I think I'm going to have a drink.

42:37.570 --> 42:40.971
How about a shot? Would you like
to have a shot? I'm gonna have a shot.

42:42.408 --> 42:44.603
Yeah. Yeah, I'd like a shot.

42:56.522 --> 42:57.921
Ooh.

43:02.295 --> 43:05.355
You know the thing about this music?

43:06.065 --> 43:07.327
No, what?

43:07.500 --> 43:08.831
Mm.

43:11.938 --> 43:14.202
The thing about this music...

43:14.574 --> 43:18.567
...is the same thing about this whiskey.

43:19.145 --> 43:20.510
Which is?

43:20.947 --> 43:22.312
Mm.

43:28.454 --> 43:29.478
I forget.

43:30.156 --> 43:32.021
Now, I love Jean...

43:32.191 --> 43:35.854
...but she buys all this canned food
in case of a hurricane or something...

43:36.028 --> 43:37.427
...and she never eats it.

43:37.597 --> 43:39.792
She keeps it forever.

43:41.400 --> 43:43.368
1996.

43:43.536 --> 43:45.504
'96.

43:46.505 --> 43:48.370
That's Hurricane Bertha.

43:49.108 --> 43:50.302
Mm.

43:52.044 --> 43:53.511
Spam. Spam!

43:55.848 --> 43:57.213
Who eats lard?

43:57.383 --> 44:00.318
You know what lard does to your arteries?
Do you understand?

44:00.486 --> 44:01.510
Please.

44:01.687 --> 44:03.211
Hmm.

44:08.294 --> 44:11.525
I have always wanted
to clean Jean's pantry.

44:11.697 --> 44:12.857
- Succotash.
- Succotash.

44:13.032 --> 44:14.522
- Thank you.
- Swish!

44:14.700 --> 44:16.031
Vienna sausage.

44:16.202 --> 44:19.569
- In a can? In a can? In a can?
- In a can.

44:19.739 --> 44:21.604
- Yes!
- Here comes the wind-up.

44:21.774 --> 44:23.105
Watch out. Okay, come on.

44:23.275 --> 44:25.436
- On the mound for Atlanta...
- World Series.

44:25.611 --> 44:27.602
Smoking John Smoltz.

44:27.780 --> 44:30.772
- The crowd is on their feet. Wait.
- Get out of the way!

44:30.950 --> 44:36.786
He wins! They win! The crowd goes wild.
Yes, yes.

44:36.956 --> 44:39.925
- Oh, yeah.
- Quite an arm you got there, tiger.

44:40.092 --> 44:44.961
When I was a kid, Barbie's head
was the ball and her body was the bat.

44:48.968 --> 44:51.493
Yeah!
- Yes! Another! Yes! Three.

44:54.306 --> 44:56.331
Okay. Okay, who's next?
- Whoo!

45:09.422 --> 45:10.514
You okay?

45:10.690 --> 45:13.625
I have to go to bed. I have to go to bed.

45:13.793 --> 45:16.091
- I have to go.
- Okay.

45:16.929 --> 45:18.453
Good night.

45:32.278 --> 45:34.974
Easy with the door, tiger.

45:35.381 --> 45:37.315
Oh, thank you.

45:37.483 --> 45:40.008
- How you feeling?
- Ha.

45:40.186 --> 45:44.680
Well, after five out-of-date aspirin,
I'm a little better.

45:44.857 --> 45:46.085
You?

45:46.258 --> 45:49.489
Yeah, ran it off. Sort of.

45:50.763 --> 45:53.493
I put Jean's cans back.

45:53.866 --> 45:56.096
- Even the succotash?
- Ha-ha-ha.

45:57.136 --> 46:02.403
Listen, it's official, the Coast Guard
has issued a hurricane warning.

46:02.742 --> 46:06.075
If you're going back to the mainland,
you should probably get started.

46:06.812 --> 46:11.977
Well, I couldn't get an earlier
flight anyway, so, just...

46:12.785 --> 46:15.015
What about you? You going back?

46:15.488 --> 46:17.649
I can't. I told Jean
I'd look after the place.

46:42.148 --> 46:45.242
Dr. Flanner. I'm Robert Torrelson.

46:46.285 --> 46:48.947
Believe you met my son, Charlie.

46:50.756 --> 46:54.123
Get down off your high horse
and say hello to these people.

46:55.127 --> 46:57.118
You have a minute to talk, doctor?

46:57.296 --> 46:59.355
Sure.
- Won't you come inside, Mr. Torrelson?

46:59.532 --> 47:00.760
I'm all right here.

47:01.200 --> 47:02.690
I'm sorry for your loss.

47:06.372 --> 47:08.806
I wanna know what went wrong.

47:09.975 --> 47:13.206
Your wife, Mr. Torrelson,
what happened to her...

47:14.213 --> 47:18.877
...it happens in one out of 50,000 cases.
They react to the anesthesia.

47:20.019 --> 47:21.919
One out of 50,000?

47:22.087 --> 47:23.452
Yeah.

47:23.622 --> 47:27.888
Yeah, I've spent I can't tell you how
many hours breaking down the surgery.

47:28.060 --> 47:29.391
There's no one to blame.

47:31.797 --> 47:34.231
You'll never convince a jury otherwise.

47:34.400 --> 47:37.335
That what your lawyers told you to say?

47:38.370 --> 47:40.930
Actually, my lawyers
told me not to come.

47:41.106 --> 47:42.539
You come anyway.

47:42.708 --> 47:46.075
I guess that makes you
some kind of great man.

47:48.881 --> 47:51.748
Can I ask you something, doctor?

47:54.253 --> 47:58.451
Do you know what color
my wife's eyes were?

48:07.199 --> 48:09.258
My wife is dead.

48:11.537 --> 48:15.029
My wife is dead.

48:16.609 --> 48:18.668
We were married...

48:19.411 --> 48:21.936
...for 43 years.

48:43.402 --> 48:44.733
What?

48:51.543 --> 48:52.976
What?

48:53.545 --> 48:55.445
It's all right, I'll do it. I got this.

48:55.614 --> 48:57.206
You got something to say, say it.

48:57.917 --> 49:02.115
The man is in mourning. He lost his wife.

49:02.288 --> 49:05.086
- I know a little about mourning. Okay?
- Okay.

49:05.257 --> 49:09.489
Do you have any idea how much courage
it took that man to come here to see you?

49:09.662 --> 49:12.062
I'm the one
who drove 200 miles to see him.

49:12.231 --> 49:13.323
And then what?

49:13.499 --> 49:17.799
Not for one minute did you show him
that you knew he'd lost anything precious.

49:17.970 --> 49:19.267
You defended yourself.

49:19.438 --> 49:22.407
Of course I defended myself!
The guy's got a lawsuit against me.

49:22.574 --> 49:25.634
Is that how you plan on handling things
when you go visit your son?

49:25.811 --> 49:28.006
What's my son got to do with this?

49:28.180 --> 49:30.671
You know, protect yourself,
defend yourself.

49:30.849 --> 49:33.477
- Never mind, you don't get it.
- No, you don't get it.

49:33.652 --> 49:36.212
You don't get it
and Torrelson does not get it.

49:36.388 --> 49:38.447
I kept going over and
over this operation.

49:38.624 --> 49:43.652
Over it, a thousand times I went over this,
thinking that maybe I'd made a mistake...

49:43.829 --> 49:46.195
...that I wasn't as good as I need to be.

49:46.365 --> 49:48.390
Because I made a decision
a long time ago...

49:48.567 --> 49:50.660
...to be the best doctor that I could be.

49:50.836 --> 49:52.463
Not the best...

49:52.838 --> 49:55.272
...husband, maybe, the best father,
the best doctor.

49:56.175 --> 50:00.168
The only thing that really matters is I
did everything I could to save that woman.

50:00.346 --> 50:02.314
That's what I came here
to explain to him.

50:02.481 --> 50:04.142
He didn't want an explanation, Paul!

50:04.316 --> 50:05.783
What did he want from me?

50:05.951 --> 50:08.317
Realize that you are part
of the worst thing...

50:08.487 --> 50:10.387
...that will ever happen to him.

50:10.556 --> 50:13.286
He's still in that hospital room...

50:13.459 --> 50:17.623
...waiting for you to come out
and just look him in the eye.

50:19.031 --> 50:21.329
What are you so afraid of?

50:23.002 --> 50:24.299
What are you so afraid of?

50:25.471 --> 50:28.736
- How long you been married?
- What does that have to do with anything?

50:28.907 --> 50:32.104
Can you even remember
who you really are anymore?

50:32.911 --> 50:35.311
It's all about choices, Adrienne.
You make choices.

50:35.481 --> 50:38.575
You chose that life. You chose that man.

50:40.185 --> 50:42.153
Now you're going back to him,
aren't you?

50:43.088 --> 50:45.522
Just stop it. Just stop it!

52:27.626 --> 52:29.321
Adrienne!

54:58.710 --> 55:00.541
Adrienne?

55:05.150 --> 55:06.981
Adrienne?

55:42.154 --> 55:43.246
Hey.

55:43.422 --> 55:44.889
You all right?

55:45.390 --> 55:46.914
Yeah.

55:50.495 --> 55:53.328
Did you hear the phone ring
early this morning?

55:53.832 --> 55:55.060
No.

55:55.233 --> 55:58.691
Danny had an asthma attack,
and Jack took him to the hospital.

56:01.707 --> 56:03.868
- Is he all right?
- Yeah.

56:05.510 --> 56:08.138
This is the first time
anything like this has happened...

56:08.313 --> 56:10.178
...and I wasn't there.

56:11.083 --> 56:14.985
My son was lying in a hospital bed.

56:15.520 --> 56:16.851
And where was I?

56:17.022 --> 56:19.081
The lines were down.

56:19.257 --> 56:24.126
- You shouldn't blame yourself.
- Shouldn't blame myself. God.

56:24.429 --> 56:26.693
Well, I do blame myself.

56:27.165 --> 56:29.429
There was one thing
that I thought I got right...

56:29.601 --> 56:31.296
...it's being a good mother.

56:31.470 --> 56:35.873
I can't just do whatever I want to,
whenever I want to, you know?

56:36.041 --> 56:38.737
Maybe that works for you,
but it doesn't work for me.

56:38.910 --> 56:40.639
I'm sorry, I just... I can't.

57:58.523 --> 58:00.423
I know you're hurting...

58:01.126 --> 58:03.754
...because you weren't there
with your son last night.

58:07.532 --> 58:09.557
But I want you to know...

58:11.136 --> 58:14.128
...that I envy what you have.

58:17.342 --> 58:21.039
Your kids are very fortunate they have
someone who loves them as much you do.

58:22.013 --> 58:24.208
Someone who tries so hard.

58:33.692 --> 58:36.752
And any man is a fool who doesn't...

58:36.928 --> 58:39.920
...know how incredibly lucky he is...

58:41.299 --> 58:42.891
...to have you.

58:58.383 --> 59:00.783
Paul. Wait.

59:39.457 --> 59:43.985
Her eyes were dark brown and soft...

59:44.863 --> 59:46.524
...like she'd never hurt a soul.

59:47.566 --> 59:49.591
And she wouldn't, neither.

59:50.402 --> 59:53.769
I knew Jill since we was in school.

59:54.406 --> 59:57.773
That thing on her face,
she always had it.

59:57.943 --> 01:00:01.538
I didn't care about it.
I never even saw it.

01:00:04.349 --> 01:00:06.510
But she wanted it off.

01:00:11.790 --> 01:00:14.918
I'd find her in the bathroom...

01:00:17.295 --> 01:00:20.458
...crying, looking at it.

01:00:23.668 --> 01:00:27.695
She'd be saying,
"I wanna be pretty for you."

01:00:29.474 --> 01:00:32.341
It broke my heart when she'd say that.

01:00:32.677 --> 01:00:35.646
Because she was pretty. She was so...

01:00:40.552 --> 01:00:42.019
But...

01:00:42.954 --> 01:00:46.617
...that's what she wanted,
she wanted the operation.

01:00:47.359 --> 01:00:52.319
And in our whole life,
I don't remember her asking for anything.

01:00:53.498 --> 01:00:55.762
So I said yes.

01:00:57.702 --> 01:01:00.068
That was how we come to you.

01:01:05.176 --> 01:01:07.644
I wanna thank you
for showing this to me.

01:01:12.183 --> 01:01:14.879
You were the last person...

01:01:15.587 --> 01:01:18.579
...she saw or spoke to on this Earth.

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:27.826
She had all the love and kindness
in the world right inside her.

01:01:32.437 --> 01:01:35.235
You didn't know who you were seeing.

01:01:39.244 --> 01:01:41.075
And now you do.

01:01:46.384 --> 01:01:48.375
Mr. Torrelson...

01:01:53.091 --> 01:01:54.786
...I'm sorry.

01:01:59.964 --> 01:02:03.593
I am so very sorry.

01:02:26.324 --> 01:02:28.292
I'm glad I was there.

01:02:30.595 --> 01:02:32.119
Me too.

01:02:57.856 --> 01:03:01.553
Maybe today's the day
you're gonna see those ponies.

01:03:01.726 --> 01:03:04.024
- The bankers?
- Hmm.

01:03:04.195 --> 01:03:09.758
Okay, honestly, they don't come
this far down the island, ever.

01:03:10.168 --> 01:03:12.466
- But thank you.
- You'll see. One day they will.

01:03:12.637 --> 01:03:14.468
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:03:16.941 --> 01:03:18.602
Thank you.

01:03:51.075 --> 01:03:52.542
<i>Another big one came and went...</i>

01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:57.272
<i>... and just like Rodanthe Pier, we took</i>
<i>a few knocks, but we're still standing.</i>

01:03:57.448 --> 01:04:03.216
<i>So come on down for a Rodanthe-style</i>
<i>crab-crack celebration tonight.</i>

01:04:03.388 --> 01:04:05.253
Wow.

01:04:08.193 --> 01:04:09.785
Jimmy crab's pretty, isn't he?

01:04:10.461 --> 01:04:12.793
Can I just get these?
Did you make these?

01:04:13.932 --> 01:04:15.456
Is this one fried enough for you?

01:04:15.633 --> 01:04:17.294
It jumped in the boat.
- That's good.

01:04:17.468 --> 01:04:18.662
Cheers.
- Thank you.

01:04:20.238 --> 01:04:21.762
We should've brought something.

01:04:22.273 --> 01:04:23.501
You want some more of that?

01:04:27.078 --> 01:04:29.638
Hey, Dot! I'm glad to see you.
This is Paul Flanner.

01:04:29.814 --> 01:04:31.281
Hi, Paul!

01:04:32.283 --> 01:04:34.751
You got a table for us?
- I got you my own table.

01:04:42.794 --> 01:04:44.785
Uh-oh. Here comes trouble.

01:04:44.963 --> 01:04:46.658
Have fun.
- Oh, thank you.

01:04:52.770 --> 01:04:56.171
She is great. I'm telling you.

01:05:04.515 --> 01:05:05.539
Thank you.

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:10.879
Come on.
- Hey, there's more food!

01:05:11.055 --> 01:05:12.579
Thanks.

01:07:56.020 --> 01:08:00.013
Okay, this is where I'll be flying
into Esmeraldas.

01:08:01.426 --> 01:08:04.918
And then you take this long road...

01:08:05.096 --> 01:08:07.826
...closer up
into these mountains over here.

01:08:07.999 --> 01:08:13.437
That's where Mark's clinic is,
on the south incline of these mountains.

01:08:13.604 --> 01:08:14.628
Wow.

01:08:14.806 --> 01:08:19.209
There's no phones, electricity,
running water. Nothing.

01:08:20.578 --> 01:08:22.603
Nothing. It's true. And then I take...

01:08:22.779 --> 01:08:28.082
...of course, the long road here up to that,
which continues along here...

01:08:28.252 --> 01:08:32.211
...and up this very steep mountain...

01:08:33.291 --> 01:08:36.055
...and down this beautiful...

01:08:36.227 --> 01:08:40.630
...beautiful broad valley.

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:45.895
Then up this steep incline over here
and around the river.

01:08:46.069 --> 01:08:52.566
And then, oh, there's the post office
I'm gonna be sending you letters from.

01:08:53.611 --> 01:08:54.635
Yeah.

01:08:54.812 --> 01:08:59.475
Then come around this beautiful tree
over here...

01:08:59.649 --> 01:09:03.643
...and, oh, there's another post office
right there.

01:09:03.821 --> 01:09:07.551
I'll send you another one.
And another one.

01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:19.292
I don't know how long I'm gonna be
down there with Mark.

01:09:21.305 --> 01:09:23.205
Maybe a long time.

01:09:26.310 --> 01:09:27.800
I know.

01:09:31.314 --> 01:09:33.283
As long as it takes.

01:09:34.852 --> 01:09:37.149
It's the most important thing.

01:11:44.915 --> 01:11:46.382
You said we'd work it out!

01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:47.574
Jack, please.

01:11:50.988 --> 01:11:52.421
Daddy.

01:11:59.864 --> 01:12:01.559
Come here, baby.

01:12:02.066 --> 01:12:05.229
You'll see him in a bit.
He wanted me to talk to you first.

01:12:05.403 --> 01:12:08.236
Here it comes.
Here comes the crap and the bullshit.

01:12:08.406 --> 01:12:12.706
- Please, just listen. Come here, honey.
- What is there to listen to? Dad's gone.

01:12:12.877 --> 01:12:16.369
Your father and I
are not going to be together.

01:12:16.981 --> 01:12:19.882
You mean Dad wanted to come back
and you wouldn't let him.

01:12:20.051 --> 01:12:24.147
He will always be your father,
but I will not be his wife.

01:12:24.755 --> 01:12:27.519
Okay, I know that he's not perfect, okay?

01:12:27.692 --> 01:12:30.160
But you say
that we don't have to be perfect.

01:12:30.328 --> 01:12:32.796
- It's not about that.
- Why can't you just forgive him?

01:12:32.963 --> 01:12:35.295
I forgive your father.
It's not about the past.

01:12:35.466 --> 01:12:36.490
Of course it is!

01:12:36.667 --> 01:12:38.328
- Amanda, stop it.
- God, I hate you!

01:12:38.502 --> 01:12:40.333
- I really hate this!
- Stop it, please.

01:12:40.504 --> 01:12:42.734
- No!
- Yes! Listen to me. Listen to me.

01:12:42.907 --> 01:12:45.171
I know that this is hard for you
to understand.

01:12:46.177 --> 01:12:49.010
All I can tell you is that, listen,
I am still your mother...

01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:51.478
...and I am not going anywhere, baby.

01:12:53.017 --> 01:12:57.818
I love you so much, no matter what,
for my whole life.

01:12:57.988 --> 01:13:00.286
Do you understand?
That goes for your father too.

01:13:00.458 --> 01:13:03.018
That goes for your father too, Danny.

01:13:04.762 --> 01:13:06.457
But this was my decision.

01:13:07.798 --> 01:13:10.323
You have to trust
that I made the right decision.

01:13:14.472 --> 01:13:15.996
Amanda.

01:13:19.577 --> 01:13:21.044
Come here, baby.

01:13:21.212 --> 01:13:24.045
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be all right.

01:13:24.215 --> 01:13:26.513
It's all gonna be okay.

01:14:10.628 --> 01:14:13.324
Hey, Mom! Watch this!

01:14:17.935 --> 01:14:19.732
Keep it up, honey!

01:14:33.784 --> 01:14:35.752
<i>Dear Adrienne,</i>
<i>saying goodbye to you...</i>

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:37.649
<i>... was the hardest thing</i>
<i>I've ever had to do...</i>

01:14:37.822 --> 01:14:39.551
<i>... and I know I'll
never do it again.</i>

01:14:39.723 --> 01:14:41.486
<i>I'm gonna look at our time apart</i>
<i>as a chance...</i>

01:14:41.659 --> 01:14:43.923
<i>... to get to know you</i>
<i>even better than I do.</i>

01:14:45.529 --> 01:14:50.466
<i>Dear Paul, after you left,</i>
<i>I felt like I was waking up from a dream.</i>

01:14:50.634 --> 01:14:54.866
<i>I am a grown woman, for God's sake,</i>
<i>not a teenager. I have a teenager.</i>

01:14:55.039 --> 01:14:58.736
<i>I kept thinking,</i>
<i>was it the storm, the wine...</i>

01:14:58.909 --> 01:15:01.070
<i>... the way you looked at me?</i>

01:15:01.245 --> 01:15:03.736
<i>I don't know how or why,</i>
<i>but I'm old enough to know...</i>

01:15:03.914 --> 01:15:05.643
<i>... how lucky I am
to have found you.</i>

01:15:15.192 --> 01:15:16.386
Hi, Mrs. Willis.

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:17.993
- Hey, girls.
- Hi.

01:15:18.162 --> 01:15:19.925
Ooh, that's a lot of stuff.

01:15:21.899 --> 01:15:24.390
Your mom's looking pretty good
these days.

01:15:24.568 --> 01:15:26.229
Anyways...

01:15:27.204 --> 01:15:30.537
<i>It's so beautiful here.</i>
<i>But believe me, nothing...</i>

01:15:30.708 --> 01:15:33.074
<i>... nothing can compare to
the peaks and valleys...</i>

01:15:33.244 --> 01:15:35.144
<i>... I traced along
the map of your body.</i>

01:15:38.582 --> 01:15:41.176
<i>Mark is really something.</i>
<i>He never stops working.</i>

01:15:41.352 --> 01:15:44.378
<i>He's available to everybody,
all the time.</i>

01:15:44.555 --> 01:15:49.151
<i>I never thought I'd say this,</i>
<i>but now I understand why he came.</i>

01:15:50.261 --> 01:15:55.096
<i>Dear Paul, if Danny and Amanda</i>
<i>were older, I'd be right there by your side.</i>

01:15:55.266 --> 01:15:58.360
<i>But as parents, this is one of
the sacrifices we have to make.</i>

01:15:59.970 --> 01:16:03.804
<i>If I've gone this long without seeing you,</i>
<i>talking to you...</i>

01:16:03.974 --> 01:16:05.202
<i>... touching you...</i>

01:16:05.376 --> 01:16:07.139
<i>... what's a few more months?</i>

01:16:07.311 --> 01:16:10.940
<i>Listen, it's not just that you got</i>
<i>a hell of an arm, it's everything you are.</i>

01:16:11.115 --> 01:16:13.845
<i>When Jack left me,</i>
<i>it wasn't just our marriage ending.</i>

01:16:14.018 --> 01:16:16.452
<i>It was the loss</i>
<i>of all the hopes that I'd had.</i>

01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:19.817
<i>Your compassion, generosity,</i>
<i>the way you see beauty in simple things.</i>

01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:24.051
<i>I tried to move on, but the world</i>
<i>didn't seem that interested in me anymore.</i>

01:16:24.228 --> 01:16:27.322
<i>Part of me wants to jump on a plane</i>
<i>and come back. I know I can't.</i>

01:16:27.498 --> 01:16:31.628
<i>Dear Paul, I can't believe it.</i>
<i>Amanda is actually starting to come around.</i>

01:16:31.802 --> 01:16:33.531
<i>I must have seen</i>
<i>hundreds of patients.</i>

01:16:33.704 --> 01:16:34.796
<i>I'm counting the days.</i>

01:16:34.972 --> 01:16:37.600
<i>I never would've believed</i>
<i>one weekend could change my life.</i>

01:16:37.775 --> 01:16:41.176
<i>And then you came along</i>
<i>and helped me believe in myself again.</i>

01:16:43.948 --> 01:16:45.973
Mm. Mm.

01:16:47.351 --> 01:16:49.649
Who writes letters like this anymore?

01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:52.550
- I know.
- Let me see that picture again.

01:16:53.090 --> 01:16:56.082
Looks this good, appreciates you,
and he has a dirty mind.

01:16:57.361 --> 01:16:59.556
- He's definitely a keeper.
- Let me have that.

01:17:22.486 --> 01:17:26.923
<i>Dear Adrienne, when I write to you,</i>
<i>I feel your breath.</i>

01:17:27.091 --> 01:17:30.288
<i>When you read these letters,</i>
<i>I imagine you feel mine.</i>

01:17:30.461 --> 01:17:33.362
- All right, guys, he's waiting.
- Bye, Mom.

01:17:34.231 --> 01:17:35.698
Bye, Mom.

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:38.459
<i>Our letters are a part of us now.</i>

01:17:39.903 --> 01:17:42.030
<i>Part of our history.</i>

01:17:43.407 --> 01:17:46.570
<i>A reminder that we made it</i>
<i>through this time together...</i>

01:17:46.744 --> 01:17:51.477
Wait. No, Jack has the children
until Monday. Oh, yes.

01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:54.183
Thank you.

01:17:54.351 --> 01:17:57.115
I'm making the same thing
that we had that night at the inn.

01:17:57.287 --> 01:17:59.687
<i>and a promise</i>
<i>of what I hope our future will be.</i>

01:17:59.857 --> 01:18:01.290
I know.

01:18:01.859 --> 01:18:02.917
Jean.

01:18:03.093 --> 01:18:04.253
Jean.

01:18:04.428 --> 01:18:06.623
His flight's landing soon.
I'm not even dressed.

01:18:06.797 --> 01:18:10.324
No, I'm gonna have to...
I will, I promise. Of course I will.

01:18:10.501 --> 01:18:14.801
- I love you, too, darling. Bye.
- <i>Love, Paul.</i>

01:18:32.856 --> 01:18:35.689
<i>Flight 2822.</i>

01:18:36.293 --> 01:18:38.284
Arrived on time?

01:18:38.862 --> 01:18:43.356
Okay, um, well,
I'm actually calling about a passenger.

01:18:43.801 --> 01:18:46.702
Yes, last name Flanner.

01:18:48.539 --> 01:18:51.201
Well, I wanna know
if he was on the plane.

01:18:52.943 --> 01:18:56.538
Of course, I understand you don't usually
give out that information, but, um...

01:18:58.949 --> 01:19:03.943
Of course. Well, do you have a supervisor
that I could speak with, or?

01:19:05.222 --> 01:19:08.248
What would you do?
I mean, I just want this information...

01:19:08.425 --> 01:19:10.586
...and I don't know who to ask.

01:19:13.731 --> 01:19:16.825
I don't mind holding. I don't mind...
Thank you.

01:19:39.556 --> 01:19:41.820
Hi. Adrienne Willis?

01:19:41.992 --> 01:19:43.016
Yes.

01:19:44.394 --> 01:19:46.385
I'm Mark Flanner.

01:20:10.788 --> 01:20:12.517
I'm...

01:20:15.259 --> 01:20:17.727
I'm still trying to work it out myself.

01:20:24.735 --> 01:20:27.067
<i>As soon as he got there, he was different.</i>

01:20:47.491 --> 01:20:53.691
I figured, once there, he'd immediately
start taking over like he usually did.

01:20:54.631 --> 01:20:56.997
But instead, he just started working.

01:21:00.103 --> 01:21:04.802
Ahh.

01:21:14.451 --> 01:21:17.511
<i>The conditions there were tough,</i>
<i>especially in the rainy season.</i>

01:21:18.555 --> 01:21:22.286
I'd gotten word that sections of the
mountain were starting to give way.

01:21:22.459 --> 01:21:24.256
We gotta get out of here. We gotta go.

01:21:24.428 --> 01:21:26.362
Not until we get the rest of the supplies.

01:21:26.530 --> 01:21:30.261
<i>I suppose if I hadn't been</i>
<i>so determined to take everything with us...</i>

01:21:30.434 --> 01:21:32.959
It'll take two weeks.
We'll lose too many people.

01:21:33.136 --> 01:21:35.434
<i>You gotta understand,</i>
<i>in that part of the world...</i>

01:21:35.606 --> 01:21:39.064
...antibiotics and
syringes are like gold.

01:21:39.243 --> 01:21:42.337
All right, you load this stuff up.
I'll go get the rest.

01:21:42.512 --> 01:21:44.173
Okay.

01:22:23.186 --> 01:22:26.417
Just as we were starting
to know each other again...

01:22:26.590 --> 01:22:28.785
...he was taken away from me.

01:22:33.230 --> 01:22:35.858
Because of you, he was a changed man.

01:22:37.634 --> 01:22:39.864
You gave me back my father.

01:22:42.706 --> 01:22:44.333
You saved him.

01:22:58.422 --> 01:23:00.549
Well, we saved each other.

01:25:46.590 --> 01:25:48.285
Bye, Dad!
- Goodbye, I love you guys.

01:25:48.458 --> 01:25:51.393
I love you. I'll miss you.
- Mom!

01:25:52.562 --> 01:25:54.086
Mom!

01:25:55.365 --> 01:25:57.162
Mom, where are you?

01:25:57.334 --> 01:25:59.097
Mom?

01:25:59.269 --> 01:26:02.796
- Mom?
- Okay! Stop making so much noise!

01:26:05.509 --> 01:26:07.136
Hey, Mom!

01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:09.471
Mom, guess what. Mom.

01:26:12.115 --> 01:26:13.377
Mom?

01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:15.381
Okay, Danny,
I need you to go upstairs.

01:26:15.552 --> 01:26:16.576
Mom...

01:26:16.753 --> 01:26:19.085
- But what's wrong with Mom?
- Danny, just please do it, okay?

01:26:19.256 --> 01:26:22.384
Just go upstairs. Okay? Please.

01:26:29.566 --> 01:26:30.897
Mom?

01:26:37.607 --> 01:26:39.040
Mama?

01:26:45.315 --> 01:26:48.876
<i>Dear Adrienne,</i>
<i>in a few days we'll be together again.</i>

01:26:49.052 --> 01:26:53.284
<i>I can't wait to meet Danny and Amanda,</i>
<i>walk on our beach...</i>

01:26:53.456 --> 01:26:57.153
<i>... and spend another night in the
Blue Room with you in my arms.</i>

01:27:01.932 --> 01:27:06.926
<i>But most of all,</i>
<i>I can't wait for our life to begin together.</i>

01:27:07.103 --> 01:27:10.072
<i>Thank you for showing me</i>
<i>that it wasn't too late.</i>

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:15.109
<i>All I can do to repay you</i>
<i>is promise to love you forever.</i>

01:27:15.278 --> 01:27:16.905
<i>And I do.</i>

01:27:19.115 --> 01:27:21.879
Come on, Danny, let's go.
The school bus is almost here.

01:27:23.753 --> 01:27:26.586
And you're the boss of me since?

01:27:26.756 --> 01:27:28.917
Since right now. Let's go.

01:27:29.092 --> 01:27:30.923
Okay.
- Come on.

01:27:31.094 --> 01:27:32.755
Go, go, go.

01:28:11.668 --> 01:28:13.192
Thank you.

01:28:15.071 --> 01:28:16.561
Look, um...

01:28:19.643 --> 01:28:22.203
I've been wanting to explain to you,
but I don't think...

01:28:22.379 --> 01:28:25.439
Yeah, but you don't think
that I can handle it...

01:28:27.317 --> 01:28:31.344
...because, in your mind,
I'm still just a little girl.

01:28:32.355 --> 01:28:33.845
But I'm not.

01:28:35.225 --> 01:28:37.420
And I know stuff.

01:28:40.063 --> 01:28:43.624
Like what happened with you and Dad.

01:28:44.401 --> 01:28:45.993
He told me...

01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:49.363
...about how he hurt you.

01:28:56.012 --> 01:28:59.379
And all that time
that I was so mean to you...

01:29:01.518 --> 01:29:03.748
I'm really sorry.

01:29:08.458 --> 01:29:12.451
But I do know what happens.

01:29:13.029 --> 01:29:14.394
I do.

01:29:15.465 --> 01:29:17.592
So you can tell me.

01:29:18.635 --> 01:29:20.193
Okay.

01:29:22.272 --> 01:29:27.107
While your father and I were apart,
I met a man.

01:29:30.547 --> 01:29:34.847
I know you've only ever known
your father and me.

01:29:36.219 --> 01:29:39.985
And I love Jack
because he's your father.

01:29:43.126 --> 01:29:46.254
But there's another kind of love, Amanda.

01:29:47.230 --> 01:29:51.690
One that gives you the courage to be better
than you are, not less than you are.

01:29:52.268 --> 01:29:55.260
One that makes you feel
that anything is possible.

01:29:58.108 --> 01:30:00.872
I want you to know
that you could have that.

01:30:01.811 --> 01:30:04.143
I want you to hold out for it.

01:30:04.981 --> 01:30:08.314
I want you to know that you deserve it.
You hear me?

01:30:24.634 --> 01:30:26.534
Tell me about him.

01:30:39.983 --> 01:30:42.008
You made this for him?

01:30:42.185 --> 01:30:44.312
I was going to give it to him.

01:31:00.837 --> 01:31:01.929
These are letters...

01:31:02.238 --> 01:31:04.536
...that I sent to him
which came back to me.

01:32:22.719 --> 01:32:24.516
Oh, my God.

01:32:24.888 --> 01:32:26.480
Oh, my God.
