00:00.300 --> 00:03.100
Jane Doe's mother had a name,
which I can't reveal.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.300
She had hopes
which can never be realized.

00:05.300 --> 00:07.600
She had love
which has never returned.

00:07.600 --> 00:10.800
And she had kindness
which was never given back to her.

00:10.800 --> 00:14.500
Two weeks after that interview
Jane Doe's mother died of an overdose.

00:14.500 --> 00:16.900
We can only hope for two things:

00:17.000 --> 00:20.200
One, that she's reunited
with her baby daughter;

00:20.300 --> 00:22.400
And two, that her death
was not totally in vain.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.500
That can only be accomplished
if we realize

00:24.600 --> 00:27.000
that the only difference
between Jane Doe and us

00:27.100 --> 00:28.600
is the accident of where
we were born.

00:28.700 --> 00:30.300
We had no control over it.

00:30.400 --> 00:33.600
Therefore we are no better
nor more deserving than anyone else.

00:33.600 --> 00:36.100
I'm CJ Nicholas.
Good night.

00:39.400 --> 00:42.400
And after you saw the man with
the knife, what did you do?

00:42.400 --> 00:44.800
Oh, I didn't have time to do anything.
Oliver just...

00:44.800 --> 00:47.500
- Excuse me. Oliver?
- My dog.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.200
He's a Jack Russell terrier
just like the one from "Frasier."

00:50.200 --> 00:51.400
They don't know they're small.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.800
They are absolutely fearless.
It's amazing really.

00:53.800 --> 00:56.200
Mr. Tarlow, what happened after
you saw the man with the knife?

00:56.200 --> 00:57.600
Oliver just ran up and bit him.

00:57.600 --> 01:00.000
- Where?
- On the calf of his left leg.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
And Jack Russells
have very sharp teeth.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.100
There were four stab wounds.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.900
One severed the left carotid artery.

01:07.900 --> 01:10.800
Another just beneath the sternum
punctured the aorta.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.000
The remaining two
punctured the abdomen

01:13.100 --> 01:14.800
and opened the small intestines.

01:14.800 --> 01:17.500
Dr. Romans, I'd like you
to take a look at this knife

01:17.500 --> 01:20.500
previously entered
as People's Exhibit C.

01:20.500 --> 01:23.300
This was taken from
the defendant's apartment.

01:25.100 --> 01:27.600
Could that be the murder weapon?

01:27.600 --> 01:31.600
Yes, the blade's length and width
are the same as the stab wound.

01:31.600 --> 01:36.300
And when you examined this knife
did you find any traces of blood on it?

01:36.300 --> 01:38.100
No, it had recently been cleaned

01:38.200 --> 01:40.700
with a strong industrial-strength
cleaning solution.

01:40.800 --> 01:44.500
And deformities on the handle indicate
that it had been boiled.

01:44.500 --> 01:47.100
Plus striations on the blade indicate

01:47.100 --> 01:48.700
the blade had
recently been reground.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.900
I have no more questions.
Thank you, Dr. Romans.

01:50.900 --> 01:53.800
- Your witness.
- So just to be clear,

01:53.900 --> 01:56.600
what you're saying
is you don't know

01:56.600 --> 01:58.900
if this is the actual
murder weapon or not.

01:58.900 --> 02:01.100
No.

02:01.100 --> 02:03.400
Thank you.
No further questions.

02:17.600 --> 02:20.400
The dog bite on Mr. Nicholas's left calf

02:20.500 --> 02:24.100
was consistent with a dog bite
from a dog of that size and breed.

02:24.100 --> 02:26.900
Now you found a shoeprint at the scene.

02:26.900 --> 02:29.000
What kind of shoe was that?

02:29.100 --> 02:31.100
They belonged to a Montalvo sneaker.

02:31.100 --> 02:33.500
Similar to the shoes
owned by the defendant

02:33.600 --> 02:36.200
marked for evidence
as People's Exhibit D?

02:36.200 --> 02:37.900
Yes.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.000
Now is that a popular brand sneaker?

02:40.000 --> 02:42.400
No, they're extremely rare.

02:42.500 --> 02:45.300
In fact, there isn't a single store
in Shreveport that carries them.

02:45.300 --> 02:49.000
And did you compare the defendant's
sneaker with the print at the scene?

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
Yes. They were a match
for both size and weight.

02:52.100 --> 02:54.200
Now the mask,
the ski mask

02:54.300 --> 02:56.400
that was found
at the defendant's apartment

02:56.400 --> 03:00.000
marked as People's Exhibit E.
What can you tell me about this?

03:00.000 --> 03:03.400
We found pepper spray
around the eyeholes

03:03.400 --> 03:04.900
on the outside.
Someone had sprayed it.

03:04.900 --> 03:08.200
It was consistent with the pepper
spray belonging to the victim.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.600
Thank you.
I have no more questions, Your Honor.

03:12.100 --> 03:15.800
Now you can't actually tell us
that the bite on my client's calf

03:15.900 --> 03:18.300
- came from Mr. Tarlow's dog?
- No.

03:18.400 --> 03:21.800
So it could have come from any dog
of similar size and breed,

03:21.800 --> 03:24.700
- like the one owned by my client in fact?
- Yes, that's right.

03:24.700 --> 03:26.900
The crime scene photos show

03:26.900 --> 03:30.400
that there was considerable blood
spatter caused by the attack.

03:30.400 --> 03:31.800
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.300
And yet when you examined
the defendant's clothing,

03:34.300 --> 03:38.300
entered into evidence
as People's Exhibit E,

03:38.400 --> 03:41.000
you found no traces of blood at all.

03:41.100 --> 03:43.400
No, but the client had time...

03:43.500 --> 03:45.000
Just a yes or no will be sufficient.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.800
So in fact, would it be fair to say

03:48.800 --> 03:52.200
that there is no direct
forensic evidence whatsoever

03:52.200 --> 03:55.000
connecting my client to this crime?

03:55.000 --> 03:56.900
Yes.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.800
No further questions.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.600
So sorry.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.200
Yeah?

04:11.800 --> 04:13.600
You'll excuse me for one minute.

04:13.600 --> 04:15.400
- Sorry, honey.
- It's okay.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.400
This better be good.

04:39.900 --> 04:42.000
So what the hell kind
of emergency is this?

04:42.000 --> 04:44.800
- We checked Nicholas's financials again.
- Yeah.

04:44.800 --> 04:48.400
He bought a video camera at Wright's
Audio two days after the murder.

04:50.300 --> 04:51.700
There's a point to this, right?

04:51.700 --> 04:54.600
He also bought a black Reebok
jogging suit and a ski mask

04:54.600 --> 04:56.000
at the sporting goods store.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
He bought a dog
at the animal shelter.

04:58.100 --> 05:00.600
All this within a day of buying
the video camera.

05:00.700 --> 05:01.800
Something doesn't smell right.

05:01.900 --> 05:05.800
So when he went on this shopping spree,
was he alone?

05:05.800 --> 05:08.100
People at the sporting goods
store can't remember.

05:08.100 --> 05:11.000
Salesclerk at Wright's Audio said he
might have been with someone.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.500
The man at the animal shelter,
for sure

05:13.600 --> 05:15.400
remembers he was with another man.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.700
- Do you know who this man is?
- I'm pretty sure.

05:18.800 --> 05:22.400
Well, if someone did a video,
then this man's got it.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.300
You think we're being set up?

05:24.300 --> 05:27.200
We can't have that, can we?

05:33.000 --> 05:37.000
Now would you please tell the court what
you found on the defendant's pants?

05:37.000 --> 05:40.100
On request of the DA's office,
we retested the defendant's clothing.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.800
And what did you find on it?

05:41.800 --> 05:45.300
We found small traces of blood
on the seams of his sweatpants.

05:45.300 --> 05:47.500
We missed it the first time.
It happens.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.600
You Honor, we were given no
prior notice of this testimony.

05:50.700 --> 05:53.500
Judge, we only discovered
this evidence yesterday.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.800
I'll allow it.
Don't worry, Counselor.

05:55.800 --> 05:58.100
I'll give you time
to examine this evidence.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.600
Did you do a DNA analysis
of the blood

06:01.700 --> 06:03.900
that you found
on the defendant's pants?

06:03.900 --> 06:06.700
- Yes I did.
- And what did that analysis show you?

06:06.700 --> 06:09.200
The blood belonged to the victim.

06:12.100 --> 06:15.000
I have no more questions,
Your Honor.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.300
Excuse me.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.200
Stop.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.900
Oh shit.

07:14.300 --> 07:16.600
Your Honor, the prosecution rests.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.100
Are you ready to call
your first witness, Counselor?

07:19.100 --> 07:22.500
Yes, Your Honor. The defense would
like to call Dr. Aaron Wakefield.

07:31.300 --> 07:32.800
Go.
Stop stop.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.800
Stop stop.
Stop!

07:37.300 --> 07:39.400
Excuse me. Sorry.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.800
Hi, I need to open
my safety deposit box.

07:42.900 --> 07:46.400
My name's Corey Finley.
Here's my ID.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.000
Certainly, Mr. Findley.

07:49.100 --> 07:51.300
Oh, it's actually Finley.
No D.

07:51.400 --> 07:55.200
Oh. That would explain why
I cannot find your record.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.400
Probably, yeah.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.400
You know, I have a cousin
named Findley.

07:58.500 --> 07:59.800
- You do?
- With a D.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.700
Second cousin really.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.800
Or is it first cousin once removed?

08:04.800 --> 08:06.600
I can never figure that out.

08:06.700 --> 08:08.500
You see, she's married
to my first cousin.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.100
Do you know how
that removed thing works?

08:10.100 --> 08:12.500
No, I don't really...
you know, if we could possibly...

08:12.600 --> 08:15.600
Here it is.
Corey Finley no D.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.800
Do you have your key
with you, Mr. Finley no D?

08:17.900 --> 08:19.900
Yes, I do. I have my key.
There it is.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.200
- Oh, good.
- Okay.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.600
Hey.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.200
Okay.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.100
It's right in here.

08:30.500 --> 08:33.400
150, 151...

08:33.400 --> 08:36.600
2263, found it.
It's right here. It's right there.

08:36.700 --> 08:39.100
Well, of course.
There it is.

08:39.100 --> 08:41.600
Okay, here's my key.

08:41.700 --> 08:43.700
Do you think that we
could speed this up?

08:43.700 --> 08:45.800
- I'm in a bit of a rush.
- No.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.900
Okay.

08:52.200 --> 08:54.700
- Care for a private booth?
- No thank you.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.900
Mr. Finley!

09:02.700 --> 09:04.200
Oh!

09:04.300 --> 09:05.800
Ow.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.100
Excuse me.
Excuse me, stop.

09:12.100 --> 09:13.600
Sorry.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.100
And in your opinion, Dr. Wakefield,

09:17.100 --> 09:20.800
could those wounds have been
caused by a knife other than the one

09:20.900 --> 09:23.000
- belonging to the defendant?
- Absolutely.

09:23.100 --> 09:25.400
Any blade of that
approximate length

09:25.400 --> 09:27.600
or width could have
caused those wounds.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.000
There are hundreds
of knives with blades that size.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.400
Call your next witness, Mr. Spota.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.300
I can't keep stalling.

11:41.300 --> 11:43.500
Where is this surprise witness
you keep telling me about?

11:43.600 --> 11:45.000
He'll be here any second.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.900
You've been saying that
for the past four hours.

11:46.900 --> 11:49.100
- He should have been here by now.
- Counselor?

11:51.100 --> 11:53.200
Uh, Your Honor,

11:53.200 --> 11:56.200
we're expecting the appearance
of a rebuttal witness.

11:57.900 --> 11:59.800
Well, do you know where he is?

11:59.900 --> 12:02.000
Uh...

12:03.200 --> 12:04.800
no, Your Honor.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.700
Your Honor, the defense requests
a continuance at this time

12:11.800 --> 12:14.800
so we can examine the prosecution's
new forensic evidence.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.400
Motion granted.

12:16.500 --> 12:19.700
We'll meet back here at 9:00 AM
Monday morning.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.800
Court adjourned.

12:38.400 --> 12:41.600
Counselor, is the defense
ready to continue?

12:41.600 --> 12:42.900
We are, Your Honor.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.500
The defense calls CJ Nicholas.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.500
Raise your right hand.

13:01.500 --> 13:04.500
Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth,

13:04.500 --> 13:06.100
- so help you God?
- I do.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.200
Be seated.

13:18.500 --> 13:21.100
- Did you murder Doris Ruth Owens?
- I did not.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.500
So why are you on trial here today?

13:23.500 --> 13:26.700
'Cause I wanted to be.

13:27.700 --> 13:28.900
What do you mean?

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
I deliberately implicated
myself in the crime.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.500
- Why would you do such a thing?
- I was working on a story

13:33.500 --> 13:35.700
about the DA's office planting
forensic evidence

13:35.700 --> 13:37.700
in murder trials
in order to obtain guilty verdicts.

13:37.700 --> 13:40.000
Your Honor, that is
an outrageous statement.

13:40.100 --> 13:43.600
I felt the only way that I could uncover
evidence of corruption in the DA's office

13:43.600 --> 13:45.100
was to implicate myself
in the crime,

13:45.200 --> 13:48.800
to see if the DA would fabricate DNA
evidence which he now has done.

13:51.900 --> 13:53.900
Silence.

13:58.200 --> 13:59.500
Did you know about this?

13:59.600 --> 14:01.800
Not until my client told me
yesterday, Your Honor.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.900
- Is this true?
- Yes, Your Honor.

14:04.900 --> 14:07.700
- And you have evidence to support this?
- We do.

14:07.700 --> 14:10.500
Your Honor, I am not
even gonna begin to deal

14:10.500 --> 14:13.900
with how insulting
and defamatory this is.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.600
However, it is obvious that
the defense is desperate.

14:17.700 --> 14:21.100
They're trying to create a jury nullification
so you'll call for a mistrial

14:21.200 --> 14:23.500
because they know
they're going to lose.

14:23.600 --> 14:27.500
You cannot allow them to present
this ridiculous defense.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.200
The prosecution opened
the door, Your Honor,

14:30.300 --> 14:32.400
by introducing last-minute
forensic evidence.

14:32.500 --> 14:35.200
My client is on trial for his life.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.000
He should be given every latitude.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.800
You say you have evidence.
I'll give you a chance to present it.

14:39.900 --> 14:42.300
I will not... I repeat, will not

14:42.300 --> 14:45.700
let you simply make wild
and damaging accusations.

14:45.800 --> 14:47.600
Understand me, Mr. Nicholas?

14:47.600 --> 14:49.500
Oh, there will be no mistrial.

14:49.500 --> 14:53.600
There will be a contempt of court
citation for you, Mr. Spota,

14:53.600 --> 14:56.400
if your proof turns out
to be not proof.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.500
- We understand, Your Honor.
- You may continue,

14:58.600 --> 15:02.000
- although you are on a very short leash.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.700
Now, CJ, please tell the court
why you have done this.

15:04.800 --> 15:06.600
I had been investigating
the DA for some time.

15:06.600 --> 15:09.600
There had been a series of cases
in which last-minute forensic evidence,

15:09.600 --> 15:12.000
always DNA, was introduced.
So I investigated further

15:12.100 --> 15:14.800
and I became convinced that
the DA was planting evidence.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.600
But why go to such
extraordinary lengths?

15:16.600 --> 15:19.600
It was my last resort.
My editor told me to back off it.

15:19.600 --> 15:22.000
I couldn't make my suspicions
public without proof.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.300
- So what did you do?
- I found out the details of the case

15:24.400 --> 15:27.300
from Detective Nickerson. Then I went out
and bought a Jack Russell terrier

15:27.400 --> 15:29.100
and got him to bite me
on the left calf.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.600
Then I bought the switchblade,
the pants and the sneakers.

15:31.700 --> 15:33.700
This is a receipt for the sneakers

15:33.700 --> 15:36.200
I'd like to mark
as Defense Exhibit A.

15:36.300 --> 15:38.000
You can see that it is clearly dated

15:38.100 --> 15:40.900
three days
after the murder took place.

15:40.900 --> 15:44.000
This is a receipt for the sweatpants,
Defense Exhibit B.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.900
Again, dated after the murder.

15:45.900 --> 15:48.900
So if you bought the sweatpants
after the murder took place,

15:48.900 --> 15:50.600
how did the victim's blood get on it?

15:50.600 --> 15:53.000
The only answer
is the DA put it there.

15:53.100 --> 15:56.600
So you're saying because the DA's case
was purely circumstantial,

15:56.600 --> 15:59.600
he planted the evidence to tie
you to the murder scene?

15:59.600 --> 16:01.500
Yes.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.700
No further questions,
Your Honor.

16:19.100 --> 16:20.900
That's it?

16:20.900 --> 16:23.000
That's the proof

16:23.000 --> 16:26.100
that I'm a calculating
dishonest man?

16:26.100 --> 16:28.000
Not to mention a felon?

16:28.100 --> 16:31.300
A couple receipts
for a pair of sweatpants?

16:31.400 --> 16:34.600
My office and myself
is a bastion of corruption

16:34.600 --> 16:37.200
because you bought
a pair of sweatpants

16:37.200 --> 16:38.900
a few days after the murder.

16:38.900 --> 16:41.100
I've got to hand it to you,
you're something else.

16:41.200 --> 16:42.900
- And the sneakers.
- Oh, the sneakers.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.800
I forgot about the sneakers.
Well, that seals the deal right there.

16:45.900 --> 16:48.500
Judge, you've got to put
the cuffs on me right now.

16:51.400 --> 16:53.200
I agree.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.700
Do you...

17:00.700 --> 17:03.100
and I use this word very loosely...

17:03.100 --> 17:06.099
do you have any proof?

17:11.599 --> 17:14.200
I made a DVD
documenting the purchases.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.599
- Everything.
- And where is that DVD?

17:16.700 --> 17:18.800
My colleague who shot it...

17:21.500 --> 17:24.900
was killed in an accident
on his way to the courthouse.

17:26.700 --> 17:28.800
And the disc was destroyed.

17:28.900 --> 17:33.400
Well, I'm very sorry
about your colleague.

17:33.500 --> 17:36.700
But other than you saying

17:36.800 --> 17:40.200
that you have a DVD
that backs up your claims,

17:40.200 --> 17:43.100
is there...
and I use this word

17:43.200 --> 17:46.100
again lightly...

17:46.100 --> 17:48.100
is there any proof

17:48.100 --> 17:50.600
that that DVD exists?

17:53.400 --> 17:54.900
I'm sorry,
I didn't hear your answer.

17:54.900 --> 17:57.700
Answer the question,
Mr. Nicholas.

18:02.600 --> 18:05.100
- No.
- No, you will not answer the question

18:05.200 --> 18:07.300
or no you have no proof it exists?

18:07.300 --> 18:08.700
No, all you have is my word.

18:09.700 --> 18:12.900
Well, that's kind of on
shaky ground right now, isn't it?

18:12.900 --> 18:15.300
That's not for me to say.

18:15.400 --> 18:18.100
You know what, Mr. Nicholas?

18:18.200 --> 18:20.500
That's the first thing
that you've said

18:20.500 --> 18:23.900
that I agree with.

18:23.900 --> 18:26.200
It's for the jury to decide, isn't it?

18:32.500 --> 18:35.900
Now I have just one more question,

18:36.000 --> 18:39.200
one little pesky question.

18:39.300 --> 18:43.600
The fact that you bought
a pair of sneakers

18:43.600 --> 18:46.400
and sweatpants sometime
after the murder,

18:46.500 --> 18:50.200
the fact that you bought anything
after the murder,

18:50.300 --> 18:53.700
does that mean that you couldn't
have owned a pair of sneakers

18:53.700 --> 18:57.100
or sweatpants or bought
anything else for that matter

18:57.200 --> 18:58.900
before the murder?

19:02.700 --> 19:04.700
I'm sorry, I did not hear
your answer.

19:09.700 --> 19:11.400
I guess not.

19:15.100 --> 19:16.800
Thank you.

19:20.500 --> 19:23.000
Despite the sensational claims
made by the defense,

19:23.100 --> 19:25.400
CJ Nicholas was found guilty
today of first-degree murder.

19:25.400 --> 19:27.400
It took the jury less than five hours

19:27.500 --> 19:29.400
to return a verdict of guilty

19:29.500 --> 19:31.700
in the murder trial of Channel 8's
CJ Nicholas.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.800
Sentencing is next week.

19:33.900 --> 19:37.100
DA Hunter said that the state
will seek the death penalty

19:37.100 --> 19:39.200
due to the viciousness of the crime.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.200
Thanks.
Thanks for coming.

19:50.300 --> 19:52.600
What's wrong with you?
Of course I'd come.

19:52.700 --> 19:55.000
I have a speech.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.700
I've been rehearsing it
over and over.

19:56.800 --> 19:58.000
God knows I've had the time.

19:58.100 --> 20:00.100
I kinda thought I had it down,
you know?

20:00.200 --> 20:02.100
But now my mouth's all cotton.

20:02.100 --> 20:04.500
Okay, here it goes.

20:06.500 --> 20:09.300
The last time I saw you,
you said that you believed in me.

20:09.300 --> 20:11.300
You said you knew
I couldn't have done this.

20:11.300 --> 20:14.100
Then you saw the evidence at the trial
and you said to yourself,

20:14.100 --> 20:15.900
"I want to believe him.
I have to."

20:15.900 --> 20:17.900
There's all this evidence.
So much.

20:17.900 --> 20:21.000
And then the DNA evidence.
That was the last straw, wasn't it?

20:21.100 --> 20:24.000
It was the clincher.
That's why you now think I'm a murderer.

20:24.100 --> 20:25.500
- I don't.
- Yes you do.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.300
And it's all right.
You don't have to lie.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.200
I don't blame you.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.800
I just want you to listen.

20:32.300 --> 20:34.200
If there was ever a time
that you loved me,

20:34.300 --> 20:36.700
if there was ever a time you thought
I was a good person,

20:36.700 --> 20:38.600
then I want you to hear this.

20:38.600 --> 20:42.000
What I said at the trial was true.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.900
The DNA was planted by your boss,

20:43.900 --> 20:47.400
just like he planted the DNA evidence
on that cigarette in the Andre Benson case.

20:47.500 --> 20:50.800
Now I know you've never met a defendant
that didn't protest his innocence,

20:50.800 --> 20:53.000
but I swear it's true.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Finley had the disc that proved it all.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.700
And I think that Hunter had him killed

20:56.700 --> 20:59.000
because the disc that Finley had
locked in his desk went missing.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.900
I know that sounds crazy.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.500
- I believe you.
- Listen to me.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.100
I'm asking you not to believe me.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.700
I'm begging you to go
and find out for yourself.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.400
Be skeptical.
Be suspicious.

21:11.500 --> 21:14.800
Do some digging on your own.
I know how good you are.

21:14.900 --> 21:17.300
Please, you're my last hope.

21:17.400 --> 21:20.000
Why would I ask you to do
any of this if I'm guilty?

21:20.100 --> 21:23.200
Why would I ask you to find out
the truth if the truth was bad for me?

21:23.200 --> 21:25.700
Because you have nothing left to lose.

21:25.700 --> 21:27.900
Oh, Ella.

21:27.900 --> 21:30.800
You're so so wrong.

21:30.800 --> 21:32.400
I have you to lose.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.500
Death by lethal injection...

21:36.500 --> 21:38.900
that was the sentence
handed down by the jury

21:38.900 --> 21:40.800
in the CJ Nicholas murder trial,

21:40.900 --> 21:43.500
the verdict
in the penalty phase of the trial.

21:43.500 --> 21:46.500
Nicholas, when asked
if he had anything to say,

21:46.500 --> 21:48.800
maintained his innocence
and said that the real facts

21:48.800 --> 21:50.700
would someday be revealed.

21:50.700 --> 21:53.100
Nicholas was driven from the court
directly to death row

21:53.200 --> 21:54.500
at the Louisiana State Prison

21:54.600 --> 21:57.900
where he will live in complete
isolation for up to 20 hours a day

21:57.900 --> 22:01.300
until his appeal process is exhausted.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.300
This is not a happy day
for anyone.

22:06.400 --> 22:09.200
No life is more precious than another.

22:09.200 --> 22:12.100
Doris Ruth Owens's life
was taken from her.

22:12.100 --> 22:13.700
We cannot bring that back.

22:13.700 --> 22:17.100
And the young man CJ Nicholas
has forfeited his life.

22:17.100 --> 22:18.700
There's nothing to celebrate.

22:18.700 --> 22:20.900
Two lives are going to be lost,

22:20.900 --> 22:23.700
one cut short, the other wasted.

22:23.700 --> 22:26.400
And the only thing that I can say

22:26.500 --> 22:29.100
is that the jury's verdict serves justice.

22:29.100 --> 22:32.300
And in that way
it does serve us all.

22:32.300 --> 22:36.700
When I started to walk away,
I couldn't look back.

22:36.800 --> 22:40.300
I just couldn't see her wrapped
in all those newspapers

22:40.300 --> 22:43.100
in front of the church.
I couldn't.

22:43.200 --> 22:46.700
I knew she was safe

22:46.700 --> 22:48.100
and warm,

22:48.200 --> 22:50.400
that she was with God.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.700
Still...

22:52.700 --> 22:54.400
I couldn't look back.

22:54.500 --> 22:57.600
Jane Doe's mother had a name,
which I can't reveal.

22:57.600 --> 23:01.000
She had hopes
which can never be realized.

23:01.100 --> 23:02.200
She had love...

23:02.300 --> 23:05.700
May I ask you why you are questioning
me about Nicholas and Finley?

23:05.700 --> 23:08.100
I'm not representing
the district attorney's office.

23:08.100 --> 23:10.800
There's nothing official about this,
I promise.

23:10.800 --> 23:12.600
Why are you here?

23:12.700 --> 23:16.100
Please, it's strictly personal.
I'm asking for your help.

23:16.200 --> 23:19.700
If anyone finds out that I was here talking
to you I could get in a lot of trouble.

23:19.800 --> 23:22.200
Now if... and this is a big if...

23:22.300 --> 23:25.600
if there is a story here,
you have my word it will be yours.

23:25.700 --> 23:27.400
But again, I don't think
there's anything here at all.

23:27.500 --> 23:29.300
What do you want to know?

23:29.300 --> 23:32.600
Did CJ come to you about the story
of the DA planting evidence?

23:32.700 --> 23:36.600
Yeah, he claimed that Hunter planted DNA
evidence in the Andre Benson case.

23:36.700 --> 23:38.400
He said there were a lot
of other cases too.

23:38.500 --> 23:40.100
But you've got to understand,
with a guy like CJ,

23:40.100 --> 23:41.500
he always had some big story

23:41.500 --> 23:43.800
that was just one phone call away,
one source away.

23:43.800 --> 23:46.700
The problem was
he had hunches and very little else.

23:46.700 --> 23:48.500
What was he basing
these hunches on?

23:48.600 --> 23:50.500
He had a copy of the Andre Benson
interview tape.

23:50.500 --> 23:52.500
He claimed that the cigarette
that he was smoking

23:52.600 --> 23:53.900
on the tape turned up
at the crime scene.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.200
Now I asked him how could you
plant evidence at a crime scene

23:56.300 --> 23:58.200
after the crime scene photos
were taken?

23:58.300 --> 24:00.200
- Was he doing this alone?
- No.

24:00.300 --> 24:02.800
He dragged poor Finley into it.

24:06.600 --> 24:08.400
- Ella.
- Bruce.

24:08.400 --> 24:09.700
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

24:09.800 --> 24:11.300
- I'm good.
- Did you bring the information?

24:11.300 --> 24:12.700
Is that the only reason
you asked me here?

24:12.700 --> 24:14.700
Oh, stop it.
Honestly.

24:14.800 --> 24:16.800
- Thank you.
- What's this all about anyway?

24:16.800 --> 24:19.600
It's about us getting in a lot
of trouble if anyone finds out.

24:19.700 --> 24:23.300
So your lab did the DNA testing
for all 17 of these cases?

24:23.300 --> 24:26.000
- Yes.
- Was there anything unusual about them?

24:26.100 --> 24:27.500
- No, not really.
- Nothing?

24:27.500 --> 24:29.000
- Well...
- Well what?

24:29.000 --> 24:30.700
It's not something
I can put my finger on.

24:30.700 --> 24:32.500
Put another body part on it.
What is it?

24:32.600 --> 24:35.100
It's just that some of
the DNA samples,

24:35.100 --> 24:36.700
they came in at the last minute.

24:36.700 --> 24:39.400
- And that's unusual?
- Kind of. Sometimes.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.700
How many of the 17 cases?

24:41.700 --> 24:43.600
Most.

24:43.700 --> 24:45.300
Oh yeah, I remember them.

24:45.300 --> 24:48.200
How could I ever forget?
They seemed like such a nice couple.

24:48.200 --> 24:51.000
The one with the beard
always wanted to take pictures.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.500
And it turns out the nicer looking one
was a murderer.

24:53.500 --> 24:56.100
And I was standing this close to him.

24:56.200 --> 24:59.200
It gives me shivers.
I guess you can never tell, can you?

24:59.300 --> 25:01.300
No, I guess you can't.

25:50.100 --> 25:51.800
Hello?

25:51.900 --> 25:54.700
Operator, I'll accept.

25:54.800 --> 25:57.500
Ella, listen.

25:57.600 --> 25:59.900
When Finley went home and found
the disc was missing,

25:59.900 --> 26:02.100
he would have gone for backup.
Now think.

26:02.100 --> 26:04.500
What's the absolutely safest place
you could keep something?

26:04.600 --> 26:08.400
Um, maybe with somebody else.
Where does his mother live?

26:08.400 --> 26:10.100
Both of his parents are dead.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.600
- What about a friend?
- I was his closest friend.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.700
Um, a bank.

26:17.800 --> 26:19.400
A safety deposit box.

26:19.400 --> 26:21.900
Yes.
Yes, that makes sense.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.700
Okay, his bank was
the Pelican Bank & Trust.

26:24.800 --> 26:27.300
Oh yes, I remember him vividly.

26:27.300 --> 26:29.300
He was in a terrible hurry.

26:29.400 --> 26:31.400
No D in his name,

26:31.500 --> 26:35.100
unlike my second
cousin or whatever he is.

26:35.200 --> 26:36.900
Rush rush rush.

26:37.000 --> 26:40.600
He simply took something
out of his safe deposit box

26:40.700 --> 26:43.000
and literally ran out of here.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.600
No private cubicle,
nothing.

26:45.700 --> 26:47.700
He didn't even take his key.

26:47.800 --> 26:49.500
I've never seen anything
quite like it.

26:49.600 --> 26:51.000
Did you see what he removed
from the box?

26:51.100 --> 26:53.000
Oh, we're not allowed to do that.

26:53.100 --> 26:55.300
Our customers are guaranteed
complete privacy.

26:55.400 --> 26:57.800
I appreciate that, Ms. Urlanger.

26:57.900 --> 26:59.900
Miss Urlanger.
Never quite liked Ms.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.200
Sounds like a beehive.

27:02.200 --> 27:04.800
Um, you said he reached for
the box right in front of you.

27:04.800 --> 27:07.200
It's possible that you saw
what he removed

27:07.200 --> 27:10.000
because you couldn't avoid it,
isn't it?

27:10.000 --> 27:13.200
Well, now that you mention it,
maybe I kind of saw something.

27:13.300 --> 27:15.900
A plastic thingy
with something shiny inside.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.500
- A computer disc maybe?
- Maybe.

27:21.300 --> 27:23.600
The till is directly linked
to my inventory.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.300
When I scan the barcode

27:25.300 --> 27:27.500
it logs the product
and the manufacturer's number.

27:27.500 --> 27:31.100
Right, so you can match any receipt
with an item that's been purchased?

27:31.100 --> 27:33.500
Yup, as long as it has
the manufacturer's label.

27:33.500 --> 27:35.500
But I already told you guys this.

27:35.500 --> 27:37.200
You spoke to someone
from my office?

27:37.200 --> 27:39.800
- Yeah.
- Do you remember who?

27:39.800 --> 27:42.200
Yes, he said he was the DA.

28:16.200 --> 28:17.300
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.400
I called about seeing the Nicholas
case evidence box.

28:19.500 --> 28:20.900
Right, you're from the DA's office.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.100
- Yeah, I have a case number.
- That's okay. I already pulled it for you.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.900
- Oh, thank you.
- Uh-huh.

28:27.400 --> 28:28.800
Great, thanks.

29:07.100 --> 29:08.600
Ella?

29:08.700 --> 29:12.000
What are you doing here so late?

29:12.000 --> 29:13.600
I was just looking at the...

29:13.600 --> 29:16.400
the original police file
on the Belmont case.

29:16.400 --> 29:18.300
I'm not familiar with that case.

29:18.300 --> 29:20.200
It's a carjacking.
We brought him in two days ago.

29:20.300 --> 29:22.300
- You know Lieutenant Merchant.
- Yes, hi.

29:22.300 --> 29:25.100
- You keep late hours.
- So do you.

29:25.200 --> 29:28.600
I hope you're not letting your personal
life interfere with your work.

29:28.700 --> 29:30.200
What?

29:30.200 --> 29:31.900
You look tired.
You should get some rest.

29:31.900 --> 29:34.300
Yeah, I was actually
just on my way home.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.500
If you don't get any rest,
you can come down with something.

29:36.500 --> 29:39.800
And health is the most
important thing we have.

29:39.900 --> 29:41.900
Absolutely.

29:44.200 --> 29:46.500
- Good night, Ella.
- Good night, sir.

30:02.400 --> 30:04.500
Let me ask you something.

30:04.600 --> 30:07.400
If you had to run back to
your safety deposit box

30:07.400 --> 30:08.600
to get your backup disc,

30:08.600 --> 30:10.900
wouldn't that mean that there's
an original disc missing?

30:10.900 --> 30:12.300
And would it be missing?

30:12.300 --> 30:15.100
I mean, that's just not the kind
of thing that disappears, right?

30:15.200 --> 30:18.200
Maybe you lose your cell phone
or your keys or something,

30:18.300 --> 30:20.200
but definitely not

30:20.200 --> 30:23.900
the single most important piece
of evidence in your entire life.

30:25.800 --> 30:27.900
Are you listening to me?

30:27.900 --> 30:30.500
Look, I've been thinking
over and over.

30:30.600 --> 30:32.200
When I showed the tape to Weldon

30:32.300 --> 30:34.100
of Merchant giving that
cigarette to Andre Benson,

30:34.100 --> 30:36.400
Weldon said,
"How could that mean anything

30:36.400 --> 30:39.200
since the tape was made three days after
the crime scene photographs were taken?"

30:39.300 --> 30:41.200
But what if the crime photos
were doctored?

30:41.300 --> 30:42.700
What if they altered
the photo somehow?

30:42.700 --> 30:46.300
What if they put the cigarette
butt in after the photo was taken?

30:46.300 --> 30:48.300
Shit.

30:48.300 --> 30:51.100
I am not good at this.

30:51.100 --> 30:53.500
Look, it's okay.
I understand.

30:53.600 --> 30:56.800
I'm your intern,
you're an assistant DA.

30:56.800 --> 30:59.400
You don't ask interns to lunch
unless you want something.

30:59.400 --> 31:01.300
So just ask me.

31:01.400 --> 31:03.300
Listen, you know your partner?

31:03.300 --> 31:04.900
Roberta?
You remember her?

31:05.000 --> 31:06.900
Yeah, I remember
she's getting her PhD

31:06.900 --> 31:08.800
in computer science
from the university, right?

31:08.800 --> 31:10.800
- You do remember.
- Well, it's kind of delicate,

31:10.800 --> 31:13.300
but I need to speak
to an expert in digital imagery.

31:13.300 --> 31:15.200
- You mean digital forensics?
- Yes, exactly.

31:15.300 --> 31:16.600
Well, she can help you.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.700
If she doesn't have the answers for you
she knows the people who do.

31:18.800 --> 31:21.000
Great. Can you arrange a meeting
between the two of us?

31:21.000 --> 31:22.400
- Of course. When?
- Tonight?

31:22.400 --> 31:24.800
- Tonight?
- It's kind of a secret.

31:24.800 --> 31:26.700
A secret is good.
I like secrets.

31:26.700 --> 31:29.000
I mean, absolutely no one at the DA's
office can know about this.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.500
Absolutely no one.
It cannot go through the regular channels.

31:31.500 --> 31:33.400
I'll set it up for tonight.

31:34.700 --> 31:38.600
Danielle, there could
be danger here.

31:40.600 --> 31:43.500
Danger?

31:43.500 --> 31:45.500
Hi.

31:48.300 --> 31:50.800
What can I do for you this
evening, Miss Crystal?

31:50.800 --> 31:52.800
I'm really sorry
to bother you, Sergeant,

31:52.900 --> 31:54.400
especially after hours.

31:54.400 --> 31:56.000
It's just I am overwhelmed
with casework and...

31:57.400 --> 32:00.400
I haven't even been able
to start my report for DA Hunter.

32:00.400 --> 32:01.600
He's gonna have my ass tomorrow if...

32:01.700 --> 32:03.800
Am I supposed to be following you
on all of this?

32:03.800 --> 32:05.100
Oh, sorry.

32:05.100 --> 32:07.300
I get kind of wound up
when I'm nervous.

32:07.300 --> 32:10.600
We're doing an in-house study
on how crime scene evidence,

32:10.600 --> 32:12.600
specifically photos,
are archived

32:12.700 --> 32:15.100
by both the state
and local police departments...

32:15.100 --> 32:17.100
if there's anything we can do
to improve that system,

32:17.200 --> 32:19.200
you know, keep the bad guys in prison.

32:19.300 --> 32:21.200
Which brings me back
to my first question:

32:21.200 --> 32:24.000
Is there anything I can do for you
this evening, Miss Crystal?

32:24.000 --> 32:27.100
Yes. Would you please show me
how and where the digital images

32:27.100 --> 32:29.400
are downloaded from
the photographers' CF cards?

32:29.400 --> 32:32.300
How safe are they? Oh, and also,
are they JPEG compressed files

32:32.400 --> 32:35.400
or are they uncompressed? I want to
compare that to the sheriff's office.

32:36.900 --> 32:40.600
If you look down there, there's a big old
double-bolted metal door.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.600
Now all the physical
evidence is stored in there

32:42.600 --> 32:45.000
along with the hard drives.
And only the evidence sergeant

32:45.000 --> 32:46.400
has the combination to the lock.

32:46.400 --> 32:48.300
As far as images go,

32:48.400 --> 32:51.200
I don't know if they're J-whatever-
you-said or not.

32:51.300 --> 32:53.200
They're all stored on a server.

32:53.200 --> 32:56.600
And you can't access to it without
somebody with a passcode.

32:56.700 --> 32:59.200
And there ain't too many somebodies
with a passcode.

32:59.300 --> 33:00.800
And you might be one
of those somebodies?

33:00.900 --> 33:02.500
No doubt.

33:02.500 --> 33:04.000
Can you show them to me?
Please?

33:09.700 --> 33:11.500
You got a case number?

33:11.500 --> 33:13.000
Me? No.
Anything is fine.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.900
Let's see.
How about 11151?

33:17.000 --> 33:18.800
That's from...

33:18.900 --> 33:21.900
May 21, 2006.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.700
Sure, that's fine.

33:25.800 --> 33:27.500
Evidence Sergeant Gilbert.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.300
This is Colletti from Major Crime.

33:29.300 --> 33:32.500
We need the skirt and blouse
from case 18446.

33:32.600 --> 33:35.000
We need to do a DNA match
with the perp we've got in custody.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.200
We might have just caught ourselves
a serial rapist.

33:37.300 --> 33:38.700
I need to know if you have it.

33:38.700 --> 33:39.800
You want me to go
get it right now?

33:39.900 --> 33:42.800
No, I want you tell my captain
he'll get it tomorrow instead.

33:44.300 --> 33:45.800
All right, hang on.

33:45.900 --> 33:47.600
Goddamn son of a bitch.

33:47.600 --> 33:49.700
It's like goddamn
rush hour around here.

33:49.700 --> 33:51.800
Goddamn son of a bitch.

33:51.900 --> 33:54.900
I'm on a circus train
that's full of midgets.

33:59.000 --> 34:00.900
Goddamn son of a bitch.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.900
Everything has got to be right now.

34:04.900 --> 34:07.300
I've got your goddamn
right now right here.

34:11.400 --> 34:13.600
Okay.

34:24.800 --> 34:27.300
Okay, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

34:34.900 --> 34:38.500
Damn it.
Son of a bitch clown crap.

34:38.500 --> 34:41.000
Everything's right now.
God damn it.

34:42.300 --> 34:45.500
If I wanted to talk to people
I would have stayed in vice.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.300
Right now, right now, right now.

34:52.300 --> 34:55.000
Goddamn everything's got to be
goddamn right now.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.400
Son of a bitch.

34:56.400 --> 34:58.300
No, we ain't got it down here.

34:58.400 --> 35:01.100
Are you sure?
Case 18446, you don't have it?

35:01.200 --> 35:03.300
I'm sure 'cause ain't nobody
logged it in neither.

35:03.400 --> 35:04.800
They must have
got the number wrong.

35:04.800 --> 35:06.800
I'm in some major shit here.
I'll call you back.

35:06.900 --> 35:08.200
Yeah, you do that.

35:40.300 --> 35:42.000
Ow!

35:56.400 --> 35:58.100
So how you doing, ace?

36:03.200 --> 36:04.600
What's this all about?

36:06.500 --> 36:08.700
- Guard!
- Easy easy.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.300
Just want to see how you're getting on.

36:11.400 --> 36:13.700
Is the food okay?
They taking care of you?

36:13.700 --> 36:15.900
You know, sometimes it gets kinda
lonely in here.

36:15.900 --> 36:18.300
Why don't you just cut the bullshit?
You want something. What is it?

36:18.400 --> 36:22.100
Can't a guy even come by
and see how you're doing?

36:22.100 --> 36:24.700
- What the hell do you want?
- World peace. What do you want?

36:24.700 --> 36:27.600
I want everyone to know
what a scumbag you really are.

36:27.600 --> 36:29.700
- Oh, me?
- Yeah, you.

36:29.800 --> 36:31.000
No.

36:31.100 --> 36:33.700
No, I put away the bad guys.

36:33.700 --> 36:35.900
You planted the evidence.

36:44.400 --> 36:47.900
You do know they monitor
the phones here, don't you?

36:51.100 --> 36:53.500
You take care, ace.

36:57.200 --> 36:59.800
You son of a bitch!

37:10.200 --> 37:12.000
Hi. Come on in here.

37:14.400 --> 37:15.600
Ella?

37:15.700 --> 37:16.800
- You must be Roberta.
- Yeah.

37:16.900 --> 37:18.500
You and Danielle may
turn out to be lifesavers.

37:18.500 --> 37:20.500
I mean literal lifesavers.
I can't thank you enough.

37:20.500 --> 37:22.900
Do you have it? I want to see it.
She has it, right?

37:23.000 --> 37:26.200
Ella, this is Dell and Allen.
They're both post-doctorates here.

37:26.200 --> 37:28.200
Sociability is not their strong suit.

37:28.200 --> 37:29.800
- Say hello to Ella.
- Hello.

37:29.800 --> 37:31.400
- Do you have it?
- Here you go, fellas.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.400
They're not used to actually speaking
to other vertebrates,

37:33.500 --> 37:35.500
- so be patient.
- Right.

37:36.500 --> 37:37.600
Uh, the second one there.

37:41.500 --> 37:44.100
- Are these real dead people?
- I'm afraid so.

37:44.200 --> 37:45.900
These are great.
Can I make a copy?

37:46.000 --> 37:47.600
No, Allen.
That would be against the law.

37:47.700 --> 37:49.300
I'm Dell.

37:49.400 --> 37:51.200
He's Allen.

37:51.200 --> 37:53.900
Sorry, Dell.
Can you open this photograph right here?

37:56.500 --> 37:58.300
All right,
here's what I'm looking for.

37:58.300 --> 38:00.100
You see this cigarette right here?

38:00.200 --> 38:03.800
I need to know if you think it's possible
that this cigarette was added after the fact.

38:03.800 --> 38:06.200
They're uncompressed.
24 megs, that's good.

38:06.300 --> 38:08.200
- Why's that good?
- The more resolution the more metadata.

38:08.200 --> 38:11.100
- Metadata?
- She doesn't know what metadata is.

38:11.100 --> 38:13.100
She knows lots of stuff
that you don't know.

38:13.200 --> 38:14.700
Metadata is literally
data about data.

38:14.700 --> 38:17.400
Digital images are comprised of pixels.
That's the data.

38:17.500 --> 38:19.700
If you look closer you find
that there's metadata

38:19.800 --> 38:21.800
around the pixels.
Watch. Look over here.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.100
- See the patterns?
- Uh-huh.

38:23.100 --> 38:26.100
Tell her about what Lukas and Fridrich
and Goljan found.

38:26.200 --> 38:28.700
Tell her about the statistic
characteristics of imaging sensors.

38:28.700 --> 38:29.900
Shut up.

38:29.900 --> 38:32.300
Three researchers at Binghamton

38:32.400 --> 38:34.000
found that cameras
have a pattern noise

38:34.000 --> 38:35.600
and if you look closely enough

38:35.600 --> 38:37.900
you can find that there is a difference
in the pattern noise

38:37.900 --> 38:40.900
of the algorithm of each camera
even though they're mass manufactured.

38:40.900 --> 38:42.400
There's a subtle difference
in each one.

38:42.500 --> 38:45.300
It's actually like
a digital fingerprint.

38:45.300 --> 38:48.000
So let's look at the pattern
on this part of the image.

38:48.100 --> 38:49.400
- See it?
- Uh-huh.

38:49.500 --> 38:52.600
Now let's move over to the cigarette
and see that pattern.

38:57.900 --> 39:00.600
It's different.
Can you see it?

39:00.600 --> 39:03.700
That cigarette was definitely not
part of the original photograph.

39:03.700 --> 39:05.700
Oh my God.

39:41.100 --> 39:43.000
Shit.

39:43.100 --> 39:45.900
What was it?
Two, three, four.

39:45.900 --> 39:48.000
Four orange.
Orange orange.

39:53.600 --> 39:56.400
Where is it?

39:56.400 --> 39:58.700
Ah.

40:20.400 --> 40:22.000
Oh!

42:25.300 --> 42:27.300
You all right?

42:31.600 --> 42:34.600
- How'd you know?
- I was following him following you.

42:34.700 --> 42:35.900
Never liked that son of a bitch.

42:35.900 --> 42:37.800
I knew he was up to something
so I followed him.

42:37.800 --> 42:39.200
I don't know what else
to say but thank you.

42:39.300 --> 42:42.500
It's what I do.
We ain't all like him.

42:42.500 --> 42:44.700
I know.
I know.

42:46.700 --> 42:49.000
I've got to call this in.
It's gonna be a shitstorm.

42:49.000 --> 42:51.100
He's not the only part.

42:51.200 --> 42:52.600
This storm's bigger than you think.

42:52.600 --> 42:55.900
We could be talking Katrina here.

42:56.000 --> 42:56.000
In an incredible turn of events,

42:56.000 --> 42:58.400
In an incredible turn of events,

42:58.400 --> 43:01.100
District Attorney Mark Hunter
was arrested

43:01.100 --> 43:03.200
and charged with the falsifying
of evidence

43:03.200 --> 43:05.000
in the murder trial of Andre Benson

43:05.000 --> 43:08.600
causing a mistrial in that case
and 17 others,

43:08.700 --> 43:11.900
including the trial of Channel 8 reporter
CJ Nicholas.

43:11.900 --> 43:13.600
Hunter was taken to the county jail

43:13.600 --> 43:16.100
and booked this afternoon.
Bail is pending.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.900
Harold Rice, who is now
the acting district attorney,

43:29.900 --> 43:32.900
said that his office has to
review the Nicholas trial

43:32.900 --> 43:36.100
along with the others
because all DNA evidence

43:36.200 --> 43:38.000
in these trials is now suspect.

43:38.000 --> 43:40.300
Rice said that he has serious doubts

43:40.400 --> 43:42.500
that there was enough
evidence to retry Nicholas

43:42.600 --> 43:44.700
as the case was circumstantial

43:44.700 --> 43:47.600
and not that strong
without the DNA evidence.

43:47.600 --> 43:51.100
As a result, he saw no reason
to keep him in prison.

43:51.200 --> 43:53.500
News 8's Kelly Gertner reports.

43:53.500 --> 43:55.900
The scene was a madhouse today

43:55.900 --> 43:58.000
outside Louisiana State Prison

43:58.100 --> 44:01.200
as CJ Nicholas went from death row
to freedom

44:01.200 --> 44:02.800
in a matter of hours.

44:02.800 --> 44:05.000
As his taxi sped away
from the prison

44:05.100 --> 44:08.400
one could not escape being
struck by three things...

44:08.400 --> 44:12.400
the rise and spectacular fall
of Mark Hunter

44:12.400 --> 44:14.200
who before this afternoon

44:14.300 --> 44:16.600
was destined
to be our next governor

44:16.600 --> 44:18.200
and is now in jail;

44:18.300 --> 44:22.900
the fall and now
possibly spectacular rise

44:22.900 --> 44:27.000
of CJ Nicholas who before this
afternoon was facing execution

44:27.100 --> 44:31.400
and is now free and about
to become a national celebrity;

44:31.400 --> 44:34.100
Doris Ruth Owens...

44:34.200 --> 44:36.400
the young woman
found dead in the park

44:36.400 --> 44:39.800
shown here when she was arrested
for prostitution...

44:39.800 --> 44:42.000
her case is now open again

44:42.000 --> 44:44.600
and will likely remain unsolved.

44:44.600 --> 44:47.800
She will become one
of those statistics,

44:47.800 --> 44:50.100
an unsolved case involving

44:50.200 --> 44:52.800
a relatively unknown young woman.

46:05.400 --> 46:07.300
She was so little.

46:10.300 --> 46:12.100
...felt her grow

46:12.100 --> 46:13.900
you know, cold.

46:16.300 --> 46:19.000
Hey.

46:19.000 --> 46:20.600
You don't have to watch
that thing again.

46:20.600 --> 46:22.400
Turn it off and come back
to bed with me.

46:22.500 --> 46:24.900
I'm so dumb.
I didn't believe you about Hunter.

46:25.000 --> 46:26.800
You were right all along.
I'm so dumb.

46:26.800 --> 46:30.300
Don't torture yourself.
You were the greatest.

46:30.300 --> 46:31.800
You saved me.

46:33.300 --> 46:34.600
Why are you dressed?

46:34.600 --> 46:36.500
She was blackmailing you,
wasn't she?

46:36.500 --> 46:38.400
What?

46:38.500 --> 46:41.200
You know, sometimes you hear
an alarm bell go off in your head.

46:41.200 --> 46:44.100
You don't know what it is
or why it's there.

46:44.200 --> 46:47.300
It's like a radio station
you just can't quite get.

46:47.300 --> 46:48.800
What are you talking about?

46:56.100 --> 46:58.900
I've got to hand it to you.
This was a brilliant plan.

46:58.900 --> 47:01.300
And then I saw this photo.

47:01.400 --> 47:03.400
Bingo, there it is.

47:03.400 --> 47:05.100
That hand.

47:05.100 --> 47:07.200
I mean, who could
really forget that hand?

47:07.200 --> 47:10.700
That's Taieesha's hand.
Taieesha didn't die of an overdose.

47:10.800 --> 47:12.500
There was no Taieesha.

47:12.600 --> 47:14.300
Doris Ruth Owens

47:14.400 --> 47:17.900
was the girl you hired
from Buffalo to be Taieesha.

47:19.000 --> 47:23.200
Your award-winning documentary
was a complete phony.

47:23.300 --> 47:26.400
- Ella...
- She was blackmailing you, wasn't she?

47:26.500 --> 47:29.800
She followed you up here from Buffalo
and she was blackmailing you.

47:29.900 --> 47:33.700
She was going to expose the fact that
your precious career was a total lie.

47:33.800 --> 47:35.600
So you had to stop her.

47:35.600 --> 47:38.100
I love you and you love me.

47:38.100 --> 47:41.100
Everything was a lie.
Your entire career was a lie.

47:41.200 --> 47:44.200
You killed Doris Ruth Owens

47:44.200 --> 47:46.300
because she was threatening
to expose your lie.

47:46.400 --> 47:50.000
You are a lie.
How can I love a lie?

47:50.000 --> 47:52.200
What was I supposed to do?
Just let her bleed me to death?

47:52.300 --> 47:53.800
Ruin my whole life?

47:53.900 --> 47:56.200
What choice did I have?
You tell me.

47:56.200 --> 47:59.200
You're worth more than her?
Just like that?

48:01.500 --> 48:03.900
No. No, it's not like that.

48:10.200 --> 48:11.900
You don't have to do this.

48:13.900 --> 48:16.900
Look, Hunter put 17 people in prison
for crimes they may not have committed.

48:17.000 --> 48:19.100
Are you telling me that she's worth
more than all those people?

48:19.100 --> 48:20.900
She's worth more
than the whole system?

48:20.900 --> 48:23.900
It was a brilliant plan.
You commit the perfect murder,

48:24.000 --> 48:26.800
you expose Hunter,
you win whatever awards you want to,

48:26.800 --> 48:28.700
you get to become a star.

48:28.800 --> 48:31.800
And after you're acquitted they can't try
you again because of double jeopardy.

48:31.800 --> 48:33.700
We can go so far together.

48:33.800 --> 48:36.400
There's just one
little glitch in your plan.

48:36.400 --> 48:39.200
You weren't acquitted.
They declared a mistrial.

48:39.300 --> 48:41.500
So once they make the connection
between you and Owens

48:41.600 --> 48:43.400
they'll have enough
evidence to convict you.

48:43.400 --> 48:45.700
- This doesn't have to happen.
- Oh, yes it does.

48:45.800 --> 48:47.400
Why?

48:48.800 --> 48:51.400
Because it's too late.

49:00.300 --> 49:03.000
Ella, what have you done?

49:05.400 --> 49:07.300
What have you done!?

49:07.300 --> 49:09.500
I really don't have anything more
to say to you.

49:15.300 --> 49:17.800
You know, I just thought
of one more thing:

49:25.800 --> 49:27.500
Fuck you.
