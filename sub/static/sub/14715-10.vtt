00:00.167 --> 00:02.167
Previously on Greenleaf.

00:05.007 --> 00:06.491
Did you sleep with Grace?

00:07.838 --> 00:10.326
I didn't say anything.

00:10.351 --> 00:12.010
You didn't have to!
You deserve each other.

00:12.045 --> 00:14.249
I don't want to marry Grace.
I want to marry you.

00:14.283 --> 00:17.260
You can tell everyone at the
mansion the wedding's off.

00:17.285 --> 00:19.264
These people aren't my problem anymore.

00:19.298 --> 00:20.344
You were going to just leave?

00:20.465 --> 00:21.799
I was trying to give you two some space.

00:21.833 --> 00:23.529
There is no "us two" anymore.

00:23.564 --> 00:24.735
<i>The wedding's off.</i>

00:24.770 --> 00:26.369
Woman on speaker:
<i>And then what happened?</i>

00:26.403 --> 00:29.273
He held me down. I couldn't breathe.

00:29.308 --> 00:32.209
<i>I begged him not to do it.
He wouldn't stop.</i>

00:32.244 --> 00:33.778
- Turn it off.
- She was just about to say

00:33.812 --> 00:35.087
exactly how Mac violated her.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.726
I don't need any more evidence.

00:36.760 --> 00:38.683
I want to hear his side of all this.

00:38.717 --> 00:41.118
I will not have him tried in absentia.

00:41.153 --> 00:44.221
And your blind spot
when it comes to this girl

00:44.256 --> 00:48.931
will be your undoing,
you mark my word, James.

00:48.965 --> 00:51.028
Mae wasn't able to convince you.

00:51.062 --> 00:52.756
You didn't convince her.

00:52.790 --> 00:58.436
- I never touched her.
- Stop lying! Now!

01:19.191 --> 01:21.459
Gigi, I...

01:21.493 --> 01:23.694
It was an accident.

01:25.263 --> 01:26.330
I'm calling 911.

01:26.365 --> 01:28.876
Just wait, Grace.

01:29.750 --> 01:31.081
Give me and your daddy a minute.

01:31.116 --> 01:33.577
No. Give this to me.

01:33.611 --> 01:35.059
Mac: <i>I'm trying to do you a favor.</i>

01:35.084 --> 01:36.657
Yeah, right, Mac.

01:36.757 --> 01:37.990
The second you dial that phone,

01:38.024 --> 01:39.206
the state's going to come marching in.

01:39.241 --> 01:41.547
And you don't want that to happen.
Believe me, I know.

01:41.582 --> 01:43.295
You don't need to trust me.

01:43.330 --> 01:45.598
Daddy, why did you do this?

01:47.280 --> 01:50.148
What's going on in here? I heard...

01:50.183 --> 01:51.850
oh, Lord Jesus.

01:56.689 --> 01:58.390
Grace, you shot your uncle?

01:58.424 --> 01:59.391
- No, I didn't...
- It was me, Mae.

01:59.425 --> 02:02.240
- James.
- I'm calling the police.

02:02.274 --> 02:03.432
Mac: <i>Don't, Grace.</i>

02:03.467 --> 02:04.467
It was an accident.

02:06.071 --> 02:07.104
Just get the first aid kit.

02:07.139 --> 02:08.172
First aid kit?

02:08.205 --> 02:09.604
The bullet went clear through.

02:09.639 --> 02:10.687
I just want to stop the bleeding.

02:10.713 --> 02:12.260
We have to get you to a hospital.

02:12.288 --> 02:13.381
And then to jail.

02:13.422 --> 02:14.436
Careful, little girl.

02:14.470 --> 02:15.448
I'll take your daddy with me.

02:15.483 --> 02:16.674
For what?

02:16.734 --> 02:18.828
For shooting the man who
sexually assaulted his daughter?

02:18.862 --> 02:20.713
Believe me, I think most
juries would understand.

02:20.748 --> 02:22.058
That's not what he means.

02:22.854 --> 02:23.963
Just give us five minutes.

02:23.997 --> 02:26.791
- Excuse me?
- Mae: What just happened?

02:26.825 --> 02:28.955
Grace, just go get the first aid kit.

02:28.989 --> 02:30.163
I'm not going anywhere.

02:30.198 --> 02:31.963
Woman, give me five minutes.

02:37.654 --> 02:38.987
And then we're calling the cops.

02:43.856 --> 02:47.044
Pastor Greenleaf, What are
you doing with a gun?

02:47.079 --> 02:48.512
Are you two okay?

02:50.699 --> 02:52.650
No, we're not okay.

02:52.684 --> 02:55.419
I told you to keep an eye on
that girl, and instead you...

02:56.026 --> 02:57.321
well, I don't have to
tell you what you did.

02:57.356 --> 02:58.656
You both know.

03:03.811 --> 03:06.731
Grace, what happened?

03:06.765 --> 03:07.865
Daddy shot Mac.

03:08.752 --> 03:09.627
Dead?

03:10.177 --> 03:11.669
No.

03:13.953 --> 03:15.222
Has anyone called the cops?

03:15.256 --> 03:18.391
No. Where's the first aid kit?

03:18.425 --> 03:19.958
In the break room, why?

03:36.646 --> 03:37.980
Oh, Lord Jesus.

03:40.298 --> 03:42.900
Lord God.

03:48.206 --> 03:50.257
I know I haven't been perfect,

03:51.742 --> 03:53.210
and I know I've fallen short

03:53.245 --> 03:55.179
of what you intended me to be

03:55.213 --> 03:58.044
as a woman and a mother,

03:58.078 --> 04:01.108
and I repent of my sin... all of it.

04:02.048 --> 04:06.524
Right now, Jesus,
just tell me what to do.

04:10.195 --> 04:12.353
Pastor, what was that sound?

04:13.681 --> 04:15.028
The bishop. Don't tell me...

04:15.062 --> 04:17.714
Everyone's okay. Just make sure
no one else comes down this hall.

to gather at the gazebo

05:06.794 --> 05:09.515
by the lake at 3:00
for one last rehearsal.

05:09.540 --> 05:11.622
Wedding starts at 5:00 sharp.

05:11.656 --> 05:12.690
And take heed, y'all.

05:12.724 --> 05:14.534
Studies show that nine times out of ten,

05:14.569 --> 05:18.863
what people remember most about
the wedding is the music.

05:18.897 --> 05:20.485
Is that true?

05:20.510 --> 05:22.133
I don't know. It sounds true.

05:24.369 --> 05:25.970
Oh, I got to get home.

05:26.004 --> 05:27.451
The cocktail party is about to start.

05:28.040 --> 05:30.074
If it's not one thing with
this wedding, it's another.

05:30.108 --> 05:31.209
- Bye, y'all.
- Bye.

05:37.479 --> 05:40.885
Do you see the chaos you've
brought into this church?

05:40.919 --> 05:44.101
This family? Are you happy now?

05:45.157 --> 05:46.642
David Nelson's dead.

05:46.677 --> 05:48.176
Your uncle's been shot.

05:48.211 --> 05:50.491
Now you sucked your father
into this web of confusion.

05:50.526 --> 05:52.129
I did not tell Daddy the shoot Mac.

05:52.164 --> 05:54.218
But you knew. You knew.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.876
You had to know he would
do something like this.

05:58.543 --> 06:00.521
At least tell the truth to yourself.

06:02.664 --> 06:04.526
The rest of us will get by.

06:12.943 --> 06:14.952
Here. Knock yourselves out.

06:14.987 --> 06:19.041
- You ready?
- James, tell me what is going on.

06:19.066 --> 06:21.932
I'm sorry, Mae. I can't.

06:23.710 --> 06:26.244
- Gigi...
- Daddy, don't tell me not to call.

06:26.278 --> 06:29.066
- I don't have a choice.
- What are you talking about?

06:29.101 --> 06:31.290
Trust me. Don't call.

06:31.325 --> 06:33.304
We can figure this out on our own, Gigi,

06:33.338 --> 06:35.299
if you just give me a little time.

06:35.854 --> 06:37.445
I gave you 20 years.

06:39.021 --> 06:42.255
- Gigi.
- No! Time's up.

06:44.265 --> 06:46.162
Woman: <i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

06:46.457 --> 06:48.863
This is Pastor Grace Greenleaf
at Calvary Fellowship.

06:50.518 --> 06:51.718
Somebody's been shot.

06:53.741 --> 06:55.708
<i>♪ Amen</i>

06:59.413 --> 07:00.780
<i>♪ Amen</i>

07:09.056 --> 07:10.623
<i>♪ Well</i>

07:22.069 --> 07:26.939
<i>♪ Amen, amen, ooh.</i>

07:46.276 --> 07:47.563
I'm sorry.

08:04.524 --> 08:06.100
There. That's good. That works.

08:06.221 --> 08:08.431
So, look, I'm thinking
since the party's off,

08:08.465 --> 08:10.250
after we put Winkie down,

08:10.284 --> 08:12.065
we can maybe rope in Zora

08:12.099 --> 08:13.896
and play a little bit of whist?

08:13.931 --> 08:14.973
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

08:15.008 --> 08:16.022
Yeah, if she's up for it.

08:16.047 --> 08:17.384
All right. I'll go see.

08:21.003 --> 08:22.545
Hey! Question for you.

08:22.579 --> 08:25.848
- What the...
- Zora.

08:27.785 --> 08:29.752
I was going to ask if you wanted to play

08:29.787 --> 08:31.020
a bit of whist with us later.

08:31.055 --> 08:32.922
Knock first.

08:32.956 --> 08:34.590
Sorry.

08:38.796 --> 08:40.897
- So, you want to play?
- No.

08:51.619 --> 08:53.142
What's the matter with her?

08:53.177 --> 08:55.178
Hmm. I'll talk to her.

08:57.581 --> 08:59.515
Good job, Wink.

08:59.735 --> 09:01.150
All right, good.

09:01.185 --> 09:02.819
Yeah, you're good with the side pieces.

09:02.853 --> 09:05.254
Your daddy is an expert on those.

09:05.289 --> 09:08.060
Oh, really? Okay.

09:08.094 --> 09:10.102
<i>Good joke, though. That's pretty funny.</i>

09:10.427 --> 09:12.396
Noah: <i>You know all those
people we just sent home?</i>

09:12.430 --> 09:13.218
Grace: Yeah?

09:13.243 --> 09:14.888
They're not going to
keep quiet about this.

09:14.913 --> 09:17.180
- They say they might, but...
- I know. It's not ideal.

09:19.122 --> 09:21.870
- Hey, honey, what's up?
- Where are you?

09:21.905 --> 09:24.140
I'm at work. I'm just
wrapping a few things up.

09:24.174 --> 09:26.509
<i>I just went down
to Noah and Isabel's party.</i>

09:26.543 --> 09:27.877
No one's here.

09:27.911 --> 09:31.065
Yeah, there's a reason for that.

09:31.099 --> 09:32.548
<i>There's not going to be a wedding.</i>

09:32.583 --> 09:35.618
- Why?
- I don't know.

09:35.652 --> 09:37.153
Well, some friend of his from Huntsville

09:37.187 --> 09:38.855
is down there with his wife.
Should I tell them?

09:38.889 --> 09:41.315
- I don't know. Hold on a sec.
- What is it?

09:41.349 --> 09:43.559
Some friend of yours from
Huntsville is at the house.

09:43.594 --> 09:46.295
- Oh. Dan?
- Is it Dan?

09:46.330 --> 09:48.397
Yeah, Dan and Betty.

09:48.432 --> 09:50.199
Dan and Betty?

09:50.234 --> 09:51.200
Tell her I'll call them right now.

09:51.235 --> 09:52.435
Noah's going to call right now.

09:52.469 --> 09:53.569
Are you okay for a minute?

09:53.604 --> 09:55.339
Yeah, I'm fine. Go.

09:55.373 --> 09:57.707
And can we talk when you get home?

09:57.741 --> 09:59.142
Sure, honey, about what?

10:01.111 --> 10:02.211
Uncle Mac.

10:04.381 --> 10:06.193
Please tell me
he didn't do anything to you.

10:06.218 --> 10:08.050
<i>No, he didn't.</i>

10:08.085 --> 10:09.318
Thank God.

10:09.353 --> 10:13.002
But Zora told me what's going on

10:14.091 --> 10:15.424
and you didn't.

10:15.459 --> 10:16.492
We'll sit down and talk

10:16.527 --> 10:18.160
the minute I get home, honey, okay?

10:20.597 --> 10:22.565
- Okay?
- <i>Okay.</i>

10:24.568 --> 10:25.935
Did I miss something?

10:29.840 --> 10:33.342
So, Betty, you're also an
engineer as well, then,

10:33.377 --> 10:34.635
like Dan here?

10:34.669 --> 10:37.182
Sort of. I make agricultural robots.

10:38.104 --> 10:39.482
Mostly that clean chicken coops.

10:39.516 --> 10:43.113
- Interesting.
- It's Noah.

10:43.147 --> 10:44.453
Oh, good.

10:44.488 --> 10:46.292
Maybe he can tell us where everyone is.

10:46.327 --> 10:47.924
Noah, what's the deal?

10:52.941 --> 10:54.113
The wedding's been called off.

10:54.850 --> 10:56.566
That can't be true.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.480
Someone would've told me.

10:59.203 --> 11:01.337
- Melisse, did you hear anything?
- No.

11:03.190 --> 11:04.123
It's been called off.

11:06.325 --> 11:07.877
I know how you feel.

11:07.911 --> 11:09.615
I'm always the last person
to hear things, too.

11:21.992 --> 11:22.959
That's all of it.

11:23.327 --> 11:24.393
Are you sure?

11:24.920 --> 11:26.795
I don't want you leaving anything behind

11:26.830 --> 11:28.397
that he can be sentimental about.

11:29.570 --> 11:31.904
There's no evidence
of a bride or bridesmaids.

11:32.352 --> 11:33.503
I even took the pictures of us

11:33.528 --> 11:34.837
at Graceland off the fridge.

11:35.650 --> 11:36.805
Graceland?

12:08.092 --> 12:09.538
Hey.

12:09.573 --> 12:11.660
Dan, I am so sorry.

12:11.695 --> 12:13.158
I called so many people.

12:13.192 --> 12:14.267
I just spaced.

12:14.301 --> 12:15.478
It's all right. We had dinner.

12:15.512 --> 12:16.812
You're the one we're worried about.

12:16.973 --> 12:17.873
Hey.

12:20.350 --> 12:22.763
Grace, why didn't you call and tell me?

12:22.797 --> 12:24.820
Charity, it's not my wedding.

12:24.855 --> 12:26.543
We sat here for two hours
with those people

12:26.577 --> 12:27.987
and then we had to
finally hear it from them.

12:28.022 --> 12:29.386
What do you want me to say? I'm sorry?

12:29.420 --> 12:30.559
- Yeah.
- Gigi.

12:30.594 --> 12:32.428
Mama just called from the jail.

12:32.462 --> 12:34.630
The jail? What's going on?

12:34.665 --> 12:36.666
- Did she say why she was there?
- Yeah.

12:36.700 --> 12:38.204
Why is Mama in jail?

12:38.238 --> 12:39.838
- Look, she's not.
- I'm sorry.

12:39.872 --> 12:41.438
Don't. You did the right thing.

12:41.463 --> 12:42.870
What right thing?

12:42.905 --> 12:44.100
All right, all right.
Take it easy, babe.

12:44.135 --> 12:45.488
Don't tell me to take it easy.

12:45.523 --> 12:47.410
- Why is Mama in jail?
- Could you tell her?

12:47.444 --> 12:48.979
I have to go explain it all to Sophia.

12:49.013 --> 12:50.329
- All right.
- Thank you.

12:51.648 --> 12:53.582
Why don't you two ever tell me anything?

12:53.617 --> 12:56.385
Why am I always the last one
to know what's going on?

12:56.420 --> 12:57.987
Because this is how you act.

12:59.756 --> 13:01.085
Did you know when we moved here?

13:01.110 --> 13:02.402
Yeah, I did.

13:02.959 --> 13:04.660
And you didn't tell me?

13:04.695 --> 13:07.517
I told you as much as I
thought you needed to know.

13:07.551 --> 13:08.832
I said to keep your distance.

13:08.866 --> 13:10.125
Yeah, but that's a different thing

13:10.159 --> 13:11.567
from saying that someone's actually...

13:25.186 --> 13:26.587
Why didn't you just tell me?

13:29.940 --> 13:30.907
I don't...

13:31.879 --> 13:33.229
I didn't tell you

13:33.885 --> 13:35.391
because I thought if you knew...

13:36.620 --> 13:38.794
knew the real reason why I came back,

13:38.829 --> 13:40.830
that your dad would somehow find out.

13:40.864 --> 13:42.565
And if he knew...

13:45.366 --> 13:47.503
...he wouldn't let you come with me.

13:54.845 --> 13:59.810
You know, whenever I
wake up in the morning

14:00.744 --> 14:03.586
and I feel like I got broken early on

14:03.620 --> 14:06.321
and I'll never, ever get fixed,

14:07.961 --> 14:12.395
I walk into your room
and I see you sleeping,

14:13.136 --> 14:15.364
and I see the good thing that you are...

14:19.721 --> 14:22.122
...and I know that
I did one thing right.

14:24.212 --> 14:26.190
And I didn't want to risk losing that.

14:28.512 --> 14:32.515
So, I'm sorry. Come here.

14:32.549 --> 14:34.100
I'm sorry, honey.

14:36.115 --> 14:37.553
What?

14:44.628 --> 14:45.947
I called Dad.

14:46.903 --> 14:48.284
He's coming tomorrow.

14:55.137 --> 14:58.866
Well, I spoke with your daughter.

14:59.612 --> 15:01.477
And what was all that about?

15:02.454 --> 15:04.598
Well, I think this thing with Mac

15:04.633 --> 15:06.971
has affected her more
than she wants to let on.

15:07.517 --> 15:09.803
You might have to keep
your distance for a while...

15:10.353 --> 15:11.624
and knock.

15:12.866 --> 15:14.557
I guess I can do that.

15:19.623 --> 15:21.579
It's all just a little sad, you know?

15:23.200 --> 15:25.032
Right when I want to be closer to her,

15:25.066 --> 15:27.570
she wants to be farther away.

15:27.604 --> 15:29.044
Hey.

15:30.382 --> 15:31.339
What?

15:31.682 --> 15:32.849
You're a good dad.

15:34.789 --> 15:35.910
Say that again.

15:35.946 --> 15:39.548
You're a good dad.

15:47.123 --> 15:48.757
Thank you.

16:27.890 --> 16:29.257
I'm on my way to the airport.

16:29.292 --> 16:30.225
Can we talk?

16:33.243 --> 16:35.211
Well, at least all these berries

16:35.245 --> 16:36.979
didn't go completely to waste.

16:37.013 --> 16:38.314
What a consolation.

16:41.084 --> 16:43.853
Good morning.

16:43.887 --> 16:45.254
Is it?

16:48.670 --> 16:50.693
I've got something to say to you.

16:51.518 --> 16:54.330
- All right, I'm out.
- Don't move.

16:55.535 --> 16:57.035
All right.

16:57.300 --> 17:00.642
I am not a second-class
citizen around here.

17:00.903 --> 17:04.917
I am not someone who can
be ignored or left out...

17:04.952 --> 17:09.272
- Charity... - Mama, let
me finish for once.

17:10.568 --> 17:14.215
If you had told me
what you were doing here,

17:14.251 --> 17:16.152
- I could've helped.
- How, Charity?

17:16.185 --> 17:17.319
Don't say it like that.

17:17.354 --> 17:18.753
Mae: <i>Oh, just stop it,</i>

17:18.789 --> 17:19.888
<i>all of you, please!</i>

17:20.385 --> 17:22.054
Your father is in jail,

17:22.659 --> 17:24.827
and you're going on about some berries,

17:24.861 --> 17:27.663
and this one's up on her feet
like her dignity's at stake.

17:27.696 --> 17:28.550
It is, Mama!

17:28.576 --> 17:30.232
And whence is this dignity

17:30.267 --> 17:32.817
if it isn't from
a proper sense of horror

17:32.851 --> 17:35.004
at what your sister
has done to your father?

17:35.038 --> 17:36.205
Who are you?

17:36.796 --> 17:39.460
I'm the only child you have
that hasn't lied,

17:40.132 --> 17:44.400
cheated, or done anything
but serve this church!

17:45.215 --> 17:46.515
You've been here the whole time

17:46.550 --> 17:48.284
Mac was pulling this nonsense

17:48.318 --> 17:50.364
and you never even noticed?

17:52.155 --> 17:53.206
Who are you?

18:03.038 --> 18:05.005
Don't. I need to be alone.

18:12.439 --> 18:13.639
She's not wrong.

18:16.680 --> 18:22.852
Well, I am off to collect your father...

18:24.235 --> 18:27.839
...from the jail, if you can imagine.

18:27.874 --> 18:30.133
Oh, Melisse, the, uh...

18:32.325 --> 18:33.759
Are you bailing him out?

18:36.857 --> 18:38.381
Mac didn't press charges.

18:38.415 --> 18:40.874
Mama, can I help at least?
Can I drive you?

18:40.908 --> 18:42.620
I mean, there's going to
be media and all kind of...

18:42.654 --> 18:44.874
Son, that's sweet
of you to offer, but, no.

18:44.908 --> 18:47.334
Your father and I have a lot to discuss

18:47.368 --> 18:48.744
before we meet with the deacon board.

18:48.778 --> 18:49.607
I'll be fine.

18:58.517 --> 19:00.759
A storm is about to befall this family.

19:01.753 --> 19:04.421
<i>The kind of storm that takes down trees,</i>

19:04.456 --> 19:06.123
<i>shuts down power,</i>

19:07.015 --> 19:09.827
and washes people and whole houses away.

19:12.662 --> 19:15.933
But it's just a storm. It will pass.

19:21.573 --> 19:22.706
Well.

19:24.699 --> 19:26.711
Thank you, Melisse.

19:27.867 --> 19:28.934
On that note...

19:30.849 --> 19:32.549
- Yeah.
- Family.

19:36.821 --> 19:37.871
Yeah.

19:38.456 --> 19:39.974
I got stuff to do, too.

19:46.097 --> 19:48.933
- See you, baby.
- Bye, sweetie.

19:48.967 --> 19:50.968
Bye, Kev.

19:51.002 --> 19:52.204
Jacob.

20:00.545 --> 20:03.812
When I was dating Jacob,
my father sat me down

20:03.970 --> 20:06.245
and told me how much I had to up my game

20:06.279 --> 20:08.285
if I was going to land me
that Greenleaf boy.

20:09.854 --> 20:11.118
Can you believe that?

20:12.490 --> 20:17.061
There I was, graduating Spelman
summa cum laude,

20:17.095 --> 20:18.729
and he had me checking myself

20:18.763 --> 20:21.120
to make sure I was good
enough for this family.

20:23.425 --> 20:25.302
I don't know.

20:26.162 --> 20:29.040
What the Lord must make of all this mess

20:29.074 --> 20:31.008
so close to Heaven's front door.

20:31.042 --> 20:32.445
I guess we'll find out, huh?

20:45.890 --> 20:47.825
- I'm sorry.
- You should be.

20:50.862 --> 20:51.846
Here's the thing.

20:51.880 --> 20:53.030
I think what we had is too valuable

20:53.064 --> 20:55.065
to just throw away without even trying.

20:55.609 --> 20:58.173
- It is to me, anyway.
- Okay.

20:58.207 --> 21:00.070
I'm going to go stay with
my mom for spring break.

21:00.105 --> 21:02.433
I don't want you to call me or text me.

21:03.074 --> 21:04.675
- I won't.
- When I get back,

21:04.709 --> 21:06.221
if you want to talk
about regaining my trust

21:06.255 --> 21:08.305
and growing into the man
I know you can be,

21:08.340 --> 21:09.477
I'll listen.

21:18.089 --> 21:21.799
See, I don't think you love Grace.

21:22.494 --> 21:23.861
And don't say whether you do or not.

21:23.895 --> 21:25.072
You don't know how you feel.

21:27.346 --> 21:29.370
<i>I think what you're in
love with is the past.</i>

21:31.870 --> 21:33.362
But the past is gone.

22:00.799 --> 22:04.501
Not that it's a major concern
given all that's going on,

22:05.124 --> 22:07.939
but I was wondering, who's
going to be preaching Sunday?

22:08.476 --> 22:11.242
- Is Jacob still sat down?
- As far as I know.

22:11.276 --> 22:12.242
Grace: <i>That's my understanding.</i>

22:12.476 --> 22:14.745
Well, I'm going to be frank.

22:14.779 --> 22:16.046
I'm going to recommend

22:16.081 --> 22:17.614
that once the bishop gets here,

22:17.649 --> 22:19.416
that he reinstates Jacob.

22:19.451 --> 22:21.352
<i>I mean, we can't have a man</i>

22:21.386 --> 22:23.579
who shot someone preaching.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.157
We don't know what happened yet.

22:26.191 --> 22:28.665
Well, we know there were shots
fired in the church office.

22:28.699 --> 22:31.033
We know that Mac is in Memphis General.

22:31.067 --> 22:32.930
We know that he was shot
with the bishop's gun.

22:32.964 --> 22:36.202
It doesn't do the Gospel any favors

22:36.227 --> 22:39.670
to be preached by men of bad reputation.

22:40.890 --> 22:45.414
- Well, God is good!
- All: All the time.

22:45.439 --> 22:48.217
I guess y'all want to know
why I'm smiling.

22:48.774 --> 22:51.077
We all know that old Gospel truth...

22:51.102 --> 22:52.491
it's in the darkest time

22:52.526 --> 22:54.889
that the light of God shines brightest.

22:54.914 --> 22:57.762
And I have to say,
as I stand before you today,

22:57.787 --> 22:59.990
I feel oddly refreshed.

23:00.640 --> 23:04.504
Now, it might be because I
spent the last night in jail

23:05.022 --> 23:07.965
praying like Paul for the souls
of those I couldn't reach.

23:08.354 --> 23:11.034
Or it just might be this cool sunny day.

23:11.069 --> 23:14.071
Either way, God is God, and we go on.

23:14.513 --> 23:17.141
Would you excuse us, Pastor?

23:19.747 --> 23:20.718
What do you mean?

23:20.752 --> 23:22.179
I'd like you to leave.

23:22.213 --> 23:24.575
- Bishop?
- I'll be right with you.

23:25.829 --> 23:27.162
Pastor?

23:48.373 --> 23:51.475
- First Lady?
- Yes, Misty?

23:51.509 --> 23:53.010
Is this cake from Sweet William?

23:53.044 --> 23:54.178
Yes, it is.

23:54.758 --> 23:56.280
I wanted to get one

23:56.314 --> 23:57.448
for my granddaughter's graduation,

23:57.482 --> 23:58.947
but it was so expensive.

23:58.981 --> 24:00.751
Was it a gift?

24:01.289 --> 24:02.287
Yes, it was.

24:02.320 --> 24:03.287
From who?

24:04.241 --> 24:05.632
Mr. McCready.

24:10.595 --> 24:11.953
Bishop: <i>Now, in case
y'all were wondering,</i>

24:12.790 --> 24:14.065
I'm still in charge here.

24:17.669 --> 24:19.870
Pastor Greenleaf, you know the meeting

24:19.904 --> 24:21.843
with the deacon board is right now.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.974
I do know that. Thank you.

24:24.008 --> 24:25.075
You're not attending?

24:25.109 --> 24:27.141
I was attending. I was excused.

24:27.741 --> 24:29.413
- By the deacons.
- By the bishop.

24:30.223 --> 24:31.748
- Oh.
- Yeah.

24:33.685 --> 24:35.886
<i>Vida heard from the detectives.</i>

24:35.920 --> 24:37.652
She's going in to see them today.

24:37.686 --> 24:39.456
Oh, that's good. Danielle
said the same thing,

24:39.491 --> 24:40.824
so it'll all come out.

24:40.859 --> 24:43.694
<i>- Yes, finally.
- Grace.</i>

24:43.728 --> 24:46.129
Do you have a 10:00
I'm not aware of, Pastor?

24:46.164 --> 24:47.179
Darlene...

24:52.270 --> 24:54.471
...this is Sophia's father, Ray.

24:57.108 --> 25:00.227
Oh, nice to meet you, Ray.

25:00.252 --> 25:01.744
Nice to meet you, too, Darlene.

25:02.547 --> 25:03.847
I can tell from that look on your face

25:03.882 --> 25:05.286
you've never even heard about me.

25:07.967 --> 25:09.368
That's not true.

25:09.393 --> 25:11.022
Sure, it is. It's okay.

25:11.429 --> 25:12.167
Not your fault.

25:15.026 --> 25:16.426
Got a minute, Pastor?

26:05.583 --> 26:06.922
All this just happened?

26:07.518 --> 26:08.938
Last night.

26:11.622 --> 26:13.523
A week ago a cop is killed

26:13.557 --> 26:14.691
in the parking lot of this place,

26:14.725 --> 26:17.741
and now your dad just shot another guy?

26:19.263 --> 26:20.797
- Yeah.
- I'm taking her back to Phoenix.

26:20.831 --> 26:23.233
Just the plane ride alone

26:23.267 --> 26:24.367
would be more time
than you spent with her

26:24.401 --> 26:25.664
in the past five years, so go for it.

26:25.689 --> 26:27.637
- I'm not kidding this time.
- Neither am I.

26:27.671 --> 26:29.117
Grace, our custody agreement

26:29.142 --> 26:30.268
says I am to be consulted

26:30.293 --> 26:32.268
if you take her across the state line.

26:32.293 --> 26:33.635
That you didn't was enough for me

26:33.669 --> 26:34.871
to take you to court and win,

26:34.896 --> 26:35.774
but I didn't do that.

26:35.799 --> 26:37.368
You didn't even think to call her

26:37.393 --> 26:39.065
until we had been here for a month.

26:39.090 --> 26:41.551
You really want to argue
about this right now?

26:41.879 --> 26:44.183
You put her under the same roof

26:44.218 --> 26:45.678
as a man that you knew was capable...

26:45.703 --> 26:48.144
No. He does not live at the house.

26:48.428 --> 26:50.979
The way she tells it,
he's there every day.

26:51.595 --> 26:53.997
Hmm? What were you thinking?

26:54.032 --> 26:55.655
What do you want...

26:55.680 --> 26:57.351
what do you want me to say, Ray?

26:57.756 --> 26:59.123
That I screwed up?

27:00.450 --> 27:01.617
I screwed up.

27:04.065 --> 27:05.312
I want you to say,

27:06.103 --> 27:10.206
"Ray, I've treated you
like you're the problem

27:10.293 --> 27:12.228
ever since our daughter was born.

27:12.378 --> 27:14.509
But you're not. I am."

27:16.317 --> 27:18.351
I'm going to go see her
and we're going to talk.

27:18.376 --> 27:19.476
What is there to talk about?

27:19.708 --> 27:20.674
Whatever I want.

27:21.323 --> 27:22.475
Don't you get it?

27:22.500 --> 27:24.559
This whole "You don't
have any rights, Ray"?

27:24.593 --> 27:26.829
That's over, because you did screw up.

27:26.864 --> 27:27.764
You did.

27:41.128 --> 27:42.261
Greenleaf residence.

27:42.296 --> 27:44.130
Man: <i>Hi. Who am I speaking to?</i>

27:44.164 --> 27:46.365
Melisse. May I ask who's calling?

27:46.400 --> 27:48.524
<i>Dave Wallace, "Memphis Daily News."</i>

27:48.528 --> 27:52.025
<i>Melisse, can you confirm there was
a shooting at Calvary last night?</i>

27:53.698 --> 27:55.174
<i>I'll tell you what, Melisse.</i>

27:55.208 --> 27:56.842
<i>You don't have to say yes.</i>

27:56.877 --> 27:58.144
<i>If you can confirm it,
just stay on the line</i>

27:58.178 --> 28:00.913
<i>and say nothing, all right?</i>

28:00.948 --> 28:01.869
Okay.

28:04.128 --> 28:05.550
Kevin: <i>Charity.</i>

28:08.051 --> 28:09.634
Hey, baby. How's it going?

28:09.690 --> 28:10.690
Good.

28:13.593 --> 28:14.994
Look, I got to tell you, baby,

28:15.028 --> 28:16.128
I was so proud of you this morning,

28:16.163 --> 28:17.681
standing up to your mama like that.

28:17.716 --> 28:20.132
You were? Honest?

28:20.167 --> 28:22.268
Yeah, girl. That was impressive.

28:22.302 --> 28:23.852
Then you'll really like this.

28:24.471 --> 28:25.909
Until you come clean with me

28:25.943 --> 28:27.898
about whatever's been going on with you,

28:28.175 --> 28:29.308
I want you out of our bed.

28:29.958 --> 28:31.043
Charity, you want to see
my phone, baby? Here.

28:31.078 --> 28:33.746
And if you don't do it soon, Kevin,

28:33.780 --> 28:35.146
I want you out of the house.

28:35.181 --> 28:36.557
Charity, here. Look at my phone.

28:36.582 --> 28:38.572
I don't want to see your phone!

28:39.732 --> 28:43.235
I want to see somebody behind
your eyes I can trust,

28:43.581 --> 28:44.772
and I don't.

28:47.694 --> 28:49.328
Impressed?

28:57.637 --> 28:59.605
Karine, would you please tell the bishop

28:59.639 --> 29:02.575
that I'm going to run by the hospital

29:02.609 --> 29:04.744
and then I'll meet him at the house?

29:08.305 --> 29:09.204
Karine?

29:10.584 --> 29:12.218
Lord have mercy. That girl...

29:22.062 --> 29:23.562
Hello?

29:23.597 --> 29:25.731
Wallace: <i>Hello. To whom am I speaking?</i>

29:27.734 --> 29:28.701
To whom am I speaking?

29:29.178 --> 29:31.121
<i>Dave Wallace, "Memphis Daily News."</i>

29:31.156 --> 29:33.237
<i>I was just looking
for someone at the church</i>

29:33.272 --> 29:34.855
<i>to confirm a few facts.</i>

29:34.856 --> 29:37.176
<i>I'm aware that this
can be a little daunting.</i>

29:37.244 --> 29:39.178
<i>Just know we already have
an independent source</i>

29:39.212 --> 29:41.437
<i>at the house who's confirmed everything.</i>

29:41.855 --> 29:43.368
<i>My editor just asked me to double down</i>

29:43.403 --> 29:44.450
<i>with someone from the church.</i>

29:44.484 --> 29:45.704
An independent source?

29:46.053 --> 29:47.167
<i>That's right, ma'am.</i>

29:53.879 --> 29:56.914
So, you go to church twice a week?

29:57.196 --> 29:59.164
- Yeah.
- Wow.

29:59.670 --> 30:03.506
Well, Wednesday night
isn't really a whole service.

30:03.541 --> 30:04.716
It's more teaching.

30:04.741 --> 30:05.881
And how long does that one last?

30:06.510 --> 30:07.889
Two hours.

30:08.076 --> 30:10.772
Then there's choir
practice and youth group.

30:11.655 --> 30:14.724
And you like going to all this
church stuff all week long?

30:14.749 --> 30:17.380
It beats Paradise Valley Mall.

30:18.623 --> 30:20.843
What's that supposed to mean?

30:20.868 --> 30:23.085
Well, back in Phoenix,

30:23.437 --> 30:25.906
most Sundays I'd go
meet my friends there.

30:26.449 --> 30:27.889
And it felt like fun when we were there,

30:27.914 --> 30:32.407
but when I got home,
all I could think about

30:32.432 --> 30:35.300
was did I buy the right top?

30:35.325 --> 30:37.426
Did I keep my receipt? Who can I trust?

30:38.284 --> 30:40.352
And how am I ever
going to get enough money

30:40.377 --> 30:43.228
for that other... whatever.

30:44.309 --> 30:48.045
And I could never sleep those nights.

30:48.619 --> 30:52.522
I'd just lay there thinking

30:52.556 --> 30:55.828
and be so tired all day Monday.

30:57.310 --> 31:00.555
When I get home from church on Sunday,

31:01.924 --> 31:07.562
all I can think about is how
I can be a better person.

31:10.832 --> 31:12.308
And I sleep.

31:14.654 --> 31:16.331
I don't know.

31:17.338 --> 31:19.613
Seems to me like a bunch of people

31:19.638 --> 31:21.639
who talk about being holy all the time

31:22.109 --> 31:24.423
and then do bad things
just like everybody else.

31:25.051 --> 31:26.484
It is.

31:26.859 --> 31:30.461
But it's not just that.

31:34.908 --> 31:36.349
The new place I just opened up,

31:36.374 --> 31:37.798
it's doing really well.

31:37.975 --> 31:38.754
Yeah?

31:38.779 --> 31:42.265
Yeah, been in Eater.com and Chowhound.

31:43.012 --> 31:44.687
I know you've seen
the pictures I've sent,

31:45.276 --> 31:47.073
but when you're there
and it's full of people?

31:47.706 --> 31:48.985
I think you'd really like it.

31:49.068 --> 31:50.567
I'm sure I would.

31:51.131 --> 31:52.364
I got a condo with a pool.

31:52.841 --> 31:53.942
Cool.

31:57.151 --> 31:58.719
You're really happy here, huh?

31:59.808 --> 32:01.219
Yeah, Dad, I am.

32:13.650 --> 32:15.384
I wish Mom had told me.

32:15.721 --> 32:17.255
She should've told both of us.

32:21.561 --> 32:22.785
Thank you for coming.

32:25.714 --> 32:27.214
Thanks for calling.

32:37.562 --> 32:38.872
Zo?

32:40.736 --> 32:41.920
Zozo?

32:43.129 --> 32:44.663
Time for dinner.

32:44.697 --> 32:45.931
Zora?

32:49.701 --> 32:52.062
You are a very polite young man.

32:52.097 --> 32:53.965
<i>You could have a future in this company.</i>

32:54.216 --> 32:57.568
Mark my words. You.

33:01.714 --> 33:03.458
Tell your grandfather.

33:05.883 --> 33:08.086
- <i>- Grace: Hi, Karine.
Is my father in?</i>

33:08.121 --> 33:10.088
He doesn't want to see you.

33:12.058 --> 33:13.638
He said that?

33:14.205 --> 33:15.906
Mm-hmm.

34:06.057 --> 34:09.391
Mae, how'd you get them to let you in?

34:13.856 --> 34:14.922
The boy they have keeping guard

34:14.947 --> 34:16.982
is Connie's nephew Cameron.

34:17.840 --> 34:19.648
But he said I have to be quick.

34:20.994 --> 34:22.360
Yeah, you're going to have to be.

34:22.952 --> 34:24.929
Lawyer friend of mine is
coming by in a little bit

34:24.964 --> 34:26.853
to talk about my plea.

34:27.179 --> 34:28.264
Robert...

34:33.793 --> 34:35.487
please don't drag us through court.

34:35.525 --> 34:37.222
- Please.
- I'm not going to.

34:38.844 --> 34:39.811
Just trying to figure out

34:39.846 --> 34:41.404
how to keep all this to a minimum

34:42.126 --> 34:43.748
in terms of years.

34:44.135 --> 34:45.717
Thank you.

34:49.355 --> 34:51.322
What are you doing here, Mae?

34:57.430 --> 34:58.330
What?

35:00.693 --> 35:02.501
I'm here...

35:06.339 --> 35:08.073
I came here because the Lord said

35:08.107 --> 35:09.675
that I have to forgive you.

35:12.345 --> 35:13.945
<i>But now that I'm sitting here,</i>

35:13.980 --> 35:15.113
<i>I don't think I can.</i>

35:15.934 --> 35:18.893
I hate what you did so much, Robert.

35:20.186 --> 35:23.155
I hate what it's costing
the people I love,

35:23.189 --> 35:26.058
what it cost my little girl Faith and...

35:28.591 --> 35:31.063
the thoughts in her head
while you were doing

35:31.097 --> 35:33.065
whatever you did to her,

35:33.099 --> 35:35.867
the screaming in her soul

35:35.901 --> 35:38.036
that she had to die just to make go away

35:38.071 --> 35:39.037
that you put there.

35:39.072 --> 35:40.391
You put there!

35:41.812 --> 35:44.055
I hate you so much.

35:48.581 --> 35:51.023
And I know that if I don't forgive you,

35:52.819 --> 35:54.553
the Lord will never forgive me

35:54.587 --> 35:59.057
and deliver my family from all of this.

36:03.963 --> 36:06.698
But I don't think I can.

36:17.631 --> 36:19.759
Lord, I'm sorry.

36:49.108 --> 36:50.242
So, what time's your flight?

36:51.511 --> 36:56.435
11:00. It's a red-eye with
a connection through Denver.

37:00.520 --> 37:01.486
What are you going to do?

37:02.196 --> 37:03.241
I'm not sure.

37:04.791 --> 37:06.458
She says she likes it here.

37:06.688 --> 37:08.019
Yeah, she does.

37:09.295 --> 37:10.186
What?

37:11.719 --> 37:13.831
It just makes it hard, that's all.

37:14.437 --> 37:16.468
I'm sure that was part
of your plan all along.

37:16.502 --> 37:18.236
What are you talking about?

37:27.609 --> 37:29.256
Getting her here.

37:30.416 --> 37:32.149
Getting her used to the place.

37:35.598 --> 37:37.192
So it would seem like I'm the bad guy

37:37.226 --> 37:38.698
if I came back to take her home.

37:38.723 --> 37:40.949
- This is her home now.
- No, it isn't.

37:42.033 --> 37:43.929
I'm going to let her
finish out the school year,

37:44.348 --> 37:46.598
and after that, she's coming
back with me to Phoenix.

37:46.632 --> 37:48.212
You can't take her from me.

37:48.364 --> 37:50.079
You could come, too, if you want,

37:50.442 --> 37:52.096
but I'm not letting her stay here.

37:53.078 --> 37:55.980
The day we met, you told me
that this place was evil.

37:57.014 --> 37:59.742
What can I say? You were right.

39:00.640 --> 39:04.209
Charity? Good night, babe.
