WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:03.602
I brought you in that room.
You sit there, you watch!

00:03.604 --> 00:05.537
<i>Previously on</i> Greenleaf...

00:05.539 --> 00:07.272
Did you tell Roberto
about Isaiah?

00:07.274 --> 00:09.675
- What happened at the studio?
- Yeah, it happened.

00:09.677 --> 00:11.276
Why would you tell him?

00:11.278 --> 00:12.611
<i>He's my boyfriend.</i>

00:12.613 --> 00:14.179
I'll see you tomorrow, crazy.

00:14.181 --> 00:16.114
Did the two of you
learn anything

00:16.117 --> 00:17.516
from your season
with Basie Skanks?

00:17.518 --> 00:19.318
Jacob's not Basie.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.186
- You're delusional.
- No, you delusional!

00:21.188 --> 00:22.488
You mess with
black people's money,

00:22.490 --> 00:24.023
they're gonna rise up
and take it back.

00:24.025 --> 00:25.524
You let us fill
that bank account,

00:25.526 --> 00:27.292
and you walk.

00:27.294 --> 00:29.595
The land belongs to us.
Basie's out of the picture.

00:29.597 --> 00:32.097
Have you heard from Kevin,
by any chance?

00:32.098 --> 00:35.067
<i>No, not since he left
that letter.</i>

00:35.069 --> 00:36.635
- I wanna find Kevin.
- Okay.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.504
Is there anything
that you can do?

00:38.506 --> 00:41.407
If you ever need a personal
reference from me...

00:41.409 --> 00:43.442
- That's what this is.
- I'm afraid so.

00:43.444 --> 00:46.578
- Did that check for 10K clear yet?
<i>- Just a few minutes ago.</i>

00:46.580 --> 00:49.381
- I thank you, Ms. Cross.
- You can call me Rochelle.

00:49.383 --> 00:52.151
- Of course.
- Now, if you'll excuse me...

00:52.153 --> 00:54.253
And then he was just gone.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.422
I didn't go over there
to kill him.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:08.335 --> 01:10.669
I can't say it brings me
any pleasure

01:10.671 --> 01:14.740
to see Mac's crimes rehashed
yet again in the newspaper,

01:14.742 --> 01:19.078
but if Mr. Nash's article
answers people's questions,

01:19.080 --> 01:20.746
so be it.

01:24.118 --> 01:25.584
Hey.

01:25.586 --> 01:26.819
I didn't get in.

01:26.821 --> 01:28.120
To what?

01:28.122 --> 01:29.721
St. Josephine's Society.

01:29.723 --> 01:32.124
- That's impossible.
- How do you know?

01:32.126 --> 01:34.293
They posted
the accepted debutantes

01:34.295 --> 01:36.195
on St. Josephine's website.

01:36.197 --> 01:37.696
Let me see that thing.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.167
I'm sorry if I let down
the Greenleafs.

01:42.169 --> 01:43.268
Baby, come here.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.803
You haven't let anybody down.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.638
- No.
- No.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.874
This has got to be a mistake.

01:48.876 --> 01:51.376
I mean, this has got
to be a mistake.

01:51.378 --> 01:54.446
Greenleaf girls
are always accepted.

01:54.448 --> 01:55.714
It's no big deal.

02:00.855 --> 02:02.754
Bye, honey. Chin up.

02:07.628 --> 02:09.261
That's all because of me.

02:10.497 --> 02:13.198
Now, how is that because of you?

02:13.200 --> 02:14.533
Mama, there is an article

02:14.535 --> 02:16.168
on the front page
of the <i> Memphis News</i>

02:16.170 --> 02:18.470
about how I killed
a Memphis Man of the Year.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.906
- In selfdefense.
- I'm just saying.

02:20.908 --> 02:22.808
They can't want
all that bad publicity

02:22.810 --> 02:24.610
to overshadow their cotillion.

02:24.612 --> 02:28.614
Listen, I refuse to indulge this
kind of hopeless speculation.

02:28.616 --> 02:30.582
I'm just gonna talk
to Jacinta about it.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.784
- Who?
- You know, Jacinta.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.386
Jacinta Butler.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.722
She's the president
of the society.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.323
This has just got
to be a mistake.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.425
- Good morning.
- Morning, Daddy.

02:40.427 --> 02:42.261
I'm ready when you are, Pastor.

02:42.263 --> 02:43.762
- I'm ready. Let's do it.
- Hello, dear.

02:43.764 --> 02:44.863
Well, where are you two off to?

02:44.865 --> 02:46.832
Mama, we are going to Triumph.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.501
- What?
- Yes, it's Basie's turn

02:49.503 --> 02:53.639
to host the monthly meeting of the
Metro Memphis Council of Churches.

02:53.641 --> 02:55.641
Your daughter felt
that I should attend.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.543
And she's not wrong.

02:57.545 --> 03:01.547
If we avoided every place
where enmity and strife

03:01.549 --> 03:04.249
once confounded us...

03:04.251 --> 03:06.385
we'd all be stranded
where we stand.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.554
Exactly. Let's go.

03:08.556 --> 03:09.655
See you, Mama.

03:09.657 --> 03:10.789
All right.

03:12.259 --> 03:13.625
All right.

03:20.901 --> 03:22.935
Maricel?

03:22.937 --> 03:25.771
Do you know
the glassdoored highboy

03:25.773 --> 03:28.574
- in the hallway upstairs?
- Yes, ma'am.

03:28.576 --> 03:31.410
In the bottom drawer,
there's a wooden box.

03:31.412 --> 03:32.911
Bring it to me.

03:32.913 --> 03:35.280
And carefully, please.

03:36.317 --> 03:37.317
What's in it?

03:38.786 --> 03:40.219
A gun.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.275
How am I supposed
to go to school?

04:36.277 --> 04:39.311
All of my friends,
they're just gon...

04:39.313 --> 04:41.013
I can't even.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.650
- I tell you what.
- What?

04:44.652 --> 04:47.819
How about cotillion weekend,
you and I go to New York,

04:47.821 --> 04:51.757
just the two of us
and see <i> Hamilton?</i>

04:51.759 --> 04:53.825
You said it was too expensive.

04:53.827 --> 04:56.028
Well, we're not
buying that dress.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.898
I know, cold comfort.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.004
We can really go?

05:07.941 --> 05:09.508
Yeah, if you want to.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.711
Maybe.

05:12.713 --> 05:13.845
Okay.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.747
Can we go to school now?

05:15.749 --> 05:16.815
Okay.

05:22.389 --> 05:24.589
<i>It's a wonderful piece, Mae.</i>

05:24.591 --> 05:26.558
Where did you get it?

05:26.560 --> 05:28.960
Well, it was actually
on the property

05:28.962 --> 05:32.030
when James and I bought
the place, in a dugout.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.699
Beautiful.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.834
It's a percussion box lock.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.969
1842, I'd say.

05:37.971 --> 05:40.539
Although I can't be sure.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.407
What made you think
to bring it by?

05:42.409 --> 05:44.076
No reason especially.

05:44.078 --> 05:46.712
It's in a drawer,
and every time I look at it,

05:46.714 --> 05:49.348
I say, "Get this
thing out of here"

05:49.350 --> 05:52.417
before my new grandson
is old enough to find it."

05:52.419 --> 05:53.685
It is still a deadly weapon.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.354
Well, thank you
for confirming that.

05:55.356 --> 05:58.857
But, really, I just knew
that someone like you

05:58.859 --> 06:01.860
should have it, Jacinta,
a real collector.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.433
My.

06:08.435 --> 06:11.002
- Look at that.
- What?

06:11.004 --> 06:14.706
Well, it's the yearbook
from the year

06:14.708 --> 06:17.008
that Charity joined the Society.

06:17.010 --> 06:19.544
Let me see. Where's my baby?

06:19.546 --> 06:21.680
There she is!

06:21.682 --> 06:24.583
Wasn't she
a beautiful debutante?

06:24.585 --> 06:25.851
There's my Charity.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.552
We were all disappointed
that you elected

06:27.554 --> 06:30.122
not to nominate this year,
but I understood.

06:30.124 --> 06:31.923
It's been hard.

06:31.925 --> 06:34.526
- Excuse me?
- It made perfect sense to me,

06:34.528 --> 06:35.861
after all that
you've been through

06:35.863 --> 06:39.064
as a family this year
to not apply.

06:39.066 --> 06:42.401
But I did.
I nominated both girls.

06:42.403 --> 06:44.035
Are you positive?

06:44.037 --> 06:47.072
Jacinta, that is not something
that I would get wrong.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.807
Well, I don't remember
seeing a nomination

06:48.809 --> 06:51.476
for either Sophia or Zora
in the packets we were sent.

06:51.478 --> 06:53.078
Well, who put together
the packets?

06:53.080 --> 06:55.414
The board secretary, I assume.

06:55.416 --> 06:56.815
And who might that be?

06:56.817 --> 07:00.485
This year? Tasha Skanks.

07:01.955 --> 07:04.723
I really wanted Sophia
to have that experience.

07:04.725 --> 07:07.092
And she will, and Zora, too.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.127
You mark my words,
your mother will not

07:09.129 --> 07:10.862
let this go until she finds

07:10.864 --> 07:13.598
who's to blame
and makes her pay.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.034
You two have a lot more
in common than you think.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.639
So, try to be nice.

07:20.641 --> 07:24.209
Gigi, I have prayed that
your brother find himself.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.877
And I'm happy he has.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.046
I just wish he hadn't found
himself in my backyard.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.582
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:30.584 --> 07:32.784
How you doing, Pop? Hey.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.786
- You guys came.
- Why wouldn't we?

07:34.788 --> 07:37.956
I don't know. Basie? Me?

07:37.958 --> 07:40.158
If we tried to avoid
every place on Earth

07:40.160 --> 07:41.860
where enmity confounds us,

07:41.862 --> 07:43.495
we'd be stranded where we stand.

07:43.497 --> 07:46.064
- Amen?
- Amen.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.132
How's it feel being back?

07:47.134 --> 07:48.767
So far, so good.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.469
No fistfights.

07:50.471 --> 07:52.737
Yeah, we had a feeling
he'd be late.

07:52.739 --> 07:54.039
Yeah, Basie hasn't shown up yet.

07:54.041 --> 07:56.041
- Why am I not surprised?
- Daddy.

07:56.043 --> 07:57.809
Where does the time go?

07:57.811 --> 07:59.978
I am so sorry
to keep everybody waiting.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.848
I was just in my office
with Father Alvarado here,

08:02.850 --> 08:06.618
and he put something
on my heart that was so heavy.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.520
Pastor Greenleaf.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.058
Bring it in, bring it in.

08:14.228 --> 08:16.094
I heard Walker
invited you to speak.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.762
I was nothing but pleased.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.169
If everybody could go ahead
and take their seat.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.203
See you later.

08:26.773 --> 08:28.974
Thank you all for coming.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.709
Triumph is so happy
to be able to host

08:30.711 --> 08:32.210
this spiritual meeting of minds.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.845
- Amen.
- Amen.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.714
Let's get this show on the road.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.948
Pastor, the floor is yours.

08:40.953 --> 08:43.587
Thank you, Pastor Skanks.

08:43.590 --> 08:46.057
Fellow members
of the Memphis Metropolitan.

08:46.059 --> 08:48.760
Council of Churches,
I want to thank you

08:48.762 --> 08:50.195
for the honor
of addressing you today

08:50.197 --> 08:54.900
on behalf of the thousands
of homeless men, women,

08:54.902 --> 08:57.536
and children
in the Memphis area.

08:57.538 --> 08:59.804
Triumph Church and I
have recently parted ways,

08:59.806 --> 09:02.841
and my wife Kerissa and I have
taken up the Lord's challenge

09:02.843 --> 09:05.677
to found
The Real Church of Memphis,

09:05.679 --> 09:08.780
dedicated to serving
the homeless and hopeless,

09:08.782 --> 09:12.651
a church without walls

09:12.653 --> 09:17.188
designed to express
a love without limits...

09:17.190 --> 09:19.257
the love of Jesus Christ.

09:19.259 --> 09:22.594
Amen.

09:22.596 --> 09:26.197
So, the outro would be
something like...

09:36.743 --> 09:40.111
Or something like that.
What do you think?

09:40.113 --> 09:42.280
That would be
for the Clark Sisters?

09:42.282 --> 09:43.949
It doesn't sound right for them?

09:43.951 --> 09:45.116
Not to me.

09:45.118 --> 09:47.018
But maybe that's just me.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.588
You're the one with all the, you
know, Nashville connections.

09:49.590 --> 09:50.989
No, no, you're right.

09:50.991 --> 09:54.593
I just... I've been
writing all week.

09:54.595 --> 09:57.629
Jabari's coming tomorrow
and he's looking for a song,

09:57.631 --> 10:00.665
and everything that
I've been writing just...

10:00.667 --> 10:02.634
Just lays there.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.769
What would Carlton do?

10:06.340 --> 10:10.008
You did say the choir hasn't
been the same since he left.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.344
Touché.

10:13.647 --> 10:14.846
You'll figure it out.

10:34.668 --> 10:36.735
<i>- Praise the Lord.</i>
- Hey.

10:36.737 --> 10:39.004
<i>- Charity Greenleaf?</i>
- Yeah, it's me.

10:39.006 --> 10:41.006
<i>I thought you had
forgotten all about me.</i>

10:41.008 --> 10:44.109
Yeah, II know,
it's been a while.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.978
You really think that
I would purposefully deep six

10:46.980 --> 10:48.279
a nomination like that?

10:48.281 --> 10:49.714
Two nominations.

10:49.716 --> 10:51.249
I'm not that kind of person.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.885
Then how do you account,
Ms. Skanks,

10:53.887 --> 10:56.821
for the fact that I emailed
the nomination forms

10:56.823 --> 11:00.859
and yet Jacinta Butler said
that my granddaughters' names

11:00.861 --> 11:02.927
weren't even in the package
you gave to the committee?

11:02.929 --> 11:04.729
I don't know what to say.

11:04.731 --> 11:06.831
I can't account for anything
because I never received

11:06.833 --> 11:08.900
any of these phantom emails
that you're referring to.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.402
Ms. Skanks, please.

11:10.404 --> 11:11.903
You know, I gotta say...

11:13.740 --> 11:17.208
I am really disappointed in you.

11:17.210 --> 11:20.111
First Lady, you come to my
office and you step to me...

11:20.113 --> 11:22.414
Disappointed in me?

11:22.416 --> 11:24.816
What about my granddaughters?

11:24.818 --> 11:27.252
What have they ever done
to deserve this?

11:27.254 --> 11:30.955
I don't have anything
against Zora or the other one.

11:30.957 --> 11:32.357
That's a fact.

11:32.359 --> 11:36.094
But your husband does.
And don't deny it.

11:36.096 --> 11:39.197
He has it out for me, my family,

11:39.199 --> 11:41.399
my son, my husband.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.068
He's said so.

11:43.070 --> 11:45.970
So it's no use
in you lying about it.

11:45.972 --> 11:49.274
Okay, look, I'm not gonna deny

11:49.276 --> 11:52.143
that Basie
has his bones to pick,

11:52.145 --> 11:55.980
but, First Lady, they're good
bones, they're wellearned.

11:55.982 --> 11:58.883
So you're just gonna stand
here and just lie in my face?

11:58.885 --> 12:00.952
Don't you have any selfrespect?

12:03.090 --> 12:04.923
Yeah, I do.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.324
Get out.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.299
Wait.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.267
What now?

12:16.269 --> 12:18.470
Is that a Mickalene Casteel?

12:18.472 --> 12:20.171
It is. What about it?

12:20.173 --> 12:21.973
Where did you get it?

12:21.975 --> 12:24.309
DevlinMason Gallery.

12:24.311 --> 12:27.912
I saw the article on you
in <i> Southern Decor,</i>

12:27.914 --> 12:30.115
and I thought it was beautiful.

12:30.117 --> 12:34.319
I thought that every
wellrespected woman

12:34.321 --> 12:36.855
should have something
like that in their home,

12:36.857 --> 12:39.357
and I wanted that for myself.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.998
I'm gonna find those emails.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.533
- Good luck.
- And when I do,

12:48.535 --> 12:51.269
you're gonna find yourself
pinned like a butterfly

12:51.271 --> 12:54.072
to a display case of justice

12:54.074 --> 12:57.942
where no lie
or dissimulation avails.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.193
So, when they
finally found the boy,

13:15.195 --> 13:19.197
he was in a garage,
engine running, nearly dead.

13:19.199 --> 13:22.333
All this... all this
because he thought

13:22.335 --> 13:25.503
that God couldn't love him
if he was gay.

13:29.876 --> 13:32.877
If I may? How's the boy doing?

13:32.879 --> 13:35.914
Well, he's brain damaged
from the asphyxiation

13:35.916 --> 13:39.050
and the doctors are not sure
how much of his capacity

13:39.052 --> 13:42.120
he'll ever regain,
so prayers are welcome.

13:42.122 --> 13:44.155
Thank you, Father.

13:48.061 --> 13:51.129
Brothers and sisters, we gotta
do something about this.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.864
Now, I'm not just
speaking officially.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.132
Now, I'm speaking
as a human being.

13:54.134 --> 13:56.367
We got to do something.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.903
I look around this room,
and I know we all come

13:58.905 --> 14:01.439
from a different place when we
talk about this issue here,

14:01.441 --> 14:03.908
but we all serve the same God.

14:03.910 --> 14:05.510
- Amen?
- Amen.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.979
And that God is a God of love.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.615
Let me tell you, just to think
of a 16yearold soul

14:10.617 --> 14:13.084
doing harm to himself like this,

14:13.086 --> 14:16.554
hearing Satan's voice in his head
and he thinks it's Jesus talking.

14:16.556 --> 14:19.624
How the very walls
of God's heavenly city

14:19.626 --> 14:21.392
must shake with rage,

14:21.394 --> 14:24.462
blessed rage
at the misperception.

14:24.464 --> 14:27.098
We gotta get out
ahead of this thing.

14:27.100 --> 14:30.134
- We gotta take a stand.
- Amen!

14:45.085 --> 14:46.584
What do you make of all that?

14:48.321 --> 14:51.389
- Sad story.
- Jacob, that's it?

14:51.391 --> 14:53.291
Well, I'm definitely gonna
put that boy up in prayer

14:53.293 --> 14:54.559
this evening, but, yeah.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.394
What about you, Daddy?

14:56.396 --> 15:00.431
Well, my heart definitely goes
out to that boy and his family.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.401
But I'm not sure it serves
the church to sound off

15:03.403 --> 15:06.070
too loudly about anything
other than the cross.

15:06.072 --> 15:09.207
Some folk thrive
on controversy, though.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.142
It seems to suit their purposes.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.211
Pastor Greenleaf.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.646
Pastor Greenleaf.

15:14.648 --> 15:17.015
Thank you for what
you said up there.

15:17.017 --> 15:19.250
Thank you for asking after
that poor child's welfare.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.552
The silence in this room
was shameful,

15:21.554 --> 15:24.689
but I didn't, you know,
wanna lead the witness.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.624
People gonna be who they are.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.092
Bishop.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.997
If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna
go talk to Father Alvarado

15:32.999 --> 15:36.000
to see if there's anything
that we can do for that boy.

15:36.002 --> 15:37.936
I'll meet you in the car.

15:41.074 --> 15:43.241
There's gotta be
something more we can do.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.459
Carlton!

16:01.461 --> 16:03.227
Hello.

16:03.229 --> 16:05.463
Hello.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.032
Um... what did you want to say?

16:09.636 --> 16:13.071
I'm... glad you called.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.472
You didn't sound too glad.

16:14.474 --> 16:17.208
There's a reason for that.

16:17.210 --> 16:20.011
But I am glad that you called.

16:20.013 --> 16:23.381
It was nice just now
seeing Wanda in the hallway

16:23.383 --> 16:25.416
and Darlene and Thomas.

16:25.418 --> 16:27.185
Reggie's working
out of the house,

16:27.187 --> 16:29.487
so any excuse to get out into
the world is a good thing.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.055
But I thought you were
at Gethsemane.

16:31.057 --> 16:32.523
Not fulltime.

16:32.525 --> 16:35.593
I do some private lessons
on the side, but...

16:35.595 --> 16:37.228
II'm sorry. I didn't know.

16:37.230 --> 16:39.163
Which brings me to my point.

16:39.165 --> 16:44.068
It really hurt my feelings the way
you handled things with me leaving.

16:44.070 --> 16:46.471
Carlton, I'm... I'm sorry.

16:46.473 --> 16:48.272
I got busy.

16:48.274 --> 16:50.141
So, you're too busy for me

16:50.143 --> 16:51.642
until you need
something from me, got it.

16:51.644 --> 16:53.578
- No, that's not it.
- That's how it seems.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.079
But it's not.

16:55.081 --> 16:57.548
I really got busy.

16:57.550 --> 16:58.649
With what?

17:00.186 --> 17:01.619
I got divorced.

17:04.089 --> 17:07.392
So... you two
finally ended things.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.660
Yeah.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.662
I'm sorry to hear that.

17:11.664 --> 17:12.763
Thanks.

17:12.766 --> 17:16.099
But... that is
when you should lean

17:16.102 --> 17:18.102
on your friends,
not cut them out.

17:18.104 --> 17:22.607
Carlton, but there was so much
that I... I couldn't talk about.

17:22.608 --> 17:25.542
- Especially with you.
- Especially with me?

17:25.545 --> 17:27.211
Yeah.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.813
Well, what kind of stuff?

17:28.815 --> 17:31.049
What can't anybody say to me?

17:36.222 --> 17:38.189
You were great today, Pastor.

17:38.191 --> 17:40.291
You really were.

17:40.293 --> 17:42.160
- Appreciate that.
- I'm proud of you.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.294
Thank you.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.400
All right, Pop, I'll see you.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.402
Jacob?

17:52.505 --> 17:55.239
What you said in there
about homeless and helpless,

17:55.241 --> 17:56.374
that was good.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.144
Thanks, Pop.

18:00.146 --> 18:02.180
You're calling it
The Real Church?

18:02.182 --> 18:05.616
Yes, sir, The Real Church
of Memphis, yeah.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.318
Strong name.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.719
Got it from Jesus himself.

18:08.721 --> 18:12.090
I believe it.

18:12.092 --> 18:13.858
Why don't you and Kerissa
come by for dinner tonight

18:13.860 --> 18:15.393
if you're not busy?

18:15.395 --> 18:17.562
- I'll check and see.
- If it works.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.779
I would have sent it
back in December

18:34.781 --> 18:36.447
when the nominations were due.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.149
Now, does it go back that far?

18:38.151 --> 18:41.219
It does, but you have
files open here

18:41.221 --> 18:46.390
from "A Day With Lady Mae"
two years back.

18:46.392 --> 18:48.326
Let me close some of these
windows that you don't need.

18:48.328 --> 18:49.794
I don't want to lose anything.

18:55.535 --> 18:59.270
There. St. Josephine's.

18:59.272 --> 19:00.872
Print me two copies.

19:00.874 --> 19:02.473
Right away.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.314
Thank you, Jesus.

19:11.751 --> 19:14.719
Rochelle!

19:14.721 --> 19:16.454
This is delicious.

19:16.456 --> 19:19.490
I knew you were a
pineappleupsidedowncake type of guy.

19:19.492 --> 19:20.491
I just knew it.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.226
Guilty as charged.

19:22.228 --> 19:24.896
And this here ranks
as one of the best.

19:24.898 --> 19:27.798
It's the young pineapple.
That's the key.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.434
The old ones get
all watery and sour.

19:30.436 --> 19:32.603
- James, you will not believe...
- Mae!

19:32.605 --> 19:34.272
Mae, this here is Rochelle,

19:34.274 --> 19:35.907
the friend of the church
I was telling you about.

19:35.909 --> 19:38.543
Welcome to Calvary.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.878
Rochelle, this is Lady Mae,

19:40.880 --> 19:43.614
first lady of my church
and first lady of my life.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.917
- It's so good to meet you.
- And you.

19:45.919 --> 19:48.352
Here, Mae, taste this.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.721
Ooh, this'll make you
wanna smack your mama!

19:50.723 --> 19:52.790
I'm sure it's wonderful
cake, Bishop.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.392
Rochelle made it.

19:54.394 --> 19:55.826
She did?

19:59.399 --> 20:00.498
You did?

20:00.500 --> 20:02.466
I just wanted to thank Bishop

20:02.468 --> 20:03.901
for taking me
to lunch last week.

20:03.903 --> 20:07.505
Well, how delightfully
oldfashioned.

20:09.943 --> 20:11.776
Were you not able get
to the bottom

20:11.778 --> 20:13.744
of that mixup with Jacinta?

20:13.746 --> 20:16.247
Jacinta Butler?
She's a friend of mine.

20:16.249 --> 20:17.782
And if I can do
anything to help...

20:17.784 --> 20:20.885
- Well, I...
- I think you've done quite enough.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.489
Enjoy your cake, Bishop.

20:32.832 --> 20:33.998
Did I do something wrong?

20:34.000 --> 20:35.800
No, no, no, you were perfect.

20:38.004 --> 20:40.004
<i>This is Pastor Skanks.</i>

20:40.006 --> 20:43.574
Pastor Skanks,
this is Grace Greenleaf.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.909
Is this a good time?

20:47.847 --> 20:49.413
It is now.

20:51.017 --> 20:54.452
No, I had no plan to speak
on anything like that today.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.687
Tell you the truth,
my mind was mostly on

20:56.689 --> 20:58.789
how I was gonna acquit myself
with your brother, Jacob.

20:58.791 --> 21:01.025
That was my burden
coming in this morning.

21:01.027 --> 21:03.761
- You two seemed okay.
- Well, the Lord made a way.

21:03.763 --> 21:07.398
But, no, all that happened was
my brotherinChrist Miguel

21:07.400 --> 21:08.966
had just come
from County Hospital

21:08.968 --> 21:11.402
with that tale of woe,
and that was it.

21:11.404 --> 21:14.005
I know you know how it is.
The Lord moves when He moves.

21:14.007 --> 21:15.906
We just do our best
to follow at speed.

21:15.908 --> 21:18.709
Amen. So, what are you gonna do?

21:18.711 --> 21:21.312
- About what?
- About taking this stand.

21:21.314 --> 21:23.414
I don't know.

21:23.416 --> 21:25.049
What does God want to do?

21:25.051 --> 21:27.718
I thought maybe you were
coming over here to tell me.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.620
No, I just...

21:32.492 --> 21:34.892
You're not what I thought.

21:34.894 --> 21:36.627
You're more than I thought.

21:36.629 --> 21:39.463
Or maybe I'm better
at pretending I'm not what I am

21:39.465 --> 21:42.533
than you've ever seen a man be,
and you just wanna know.

21:42.535 --> 21:44.468
Maybe something like that.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.570
I'm gonna tell you, Pastor.

21:46.572 --> 21:48.906
I'm gonna tell you the truth,
because what I don't do is lie.

21:48.908 --> 21:51.509
Okay.

21:51.511 --> 21:54.578
I'm a little fella.
Always have been.

21:54.580 --> 21:56.314
My friends growing up
called me Little Man

21:56.316 --> 21:59.483
'cause I was small,
but I had a big mouth.

21:59.485 --> 22:00.885
Now that sounds true.

22:00.887 --> 22:02.920
I could do the dozens
like nobody,

22:02.922 --> 22:05.556
signify with the best of 'em,
but I learned early on

22:05.558 --> 22:07.491
if I was gonna survive
in this world,

22:07.493 --> 22:09.493
I had to make big friends.

22:09.495 --> 22:12.396
But this big mouth of mine,
the older I got,

22:12.398 --> 22:14.098
the smarter I got,
or maybe the more foolish,

22:14.100 --> 22:15.833
depending upon
how you look at it.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.802
This mouth just got
bigger and bigger

22:17.804 --> 22:19.937
to the point where it didn't
matter who my friends were.

22:19.939 --> 22:23.040
They weren't big enough to protect
me from my big, troublesome mouth.

22:25.578 --> 22:28.913
So, I finally made the
biggest friend I could find.

22:31.718 --> 22:33.517
Creator of Heaven and Earth.

22:33.519 --> 22:36.721
Wonderful Counselor,

22:36.723 --> 22:39.890
Jehovahjireh, Bringer of
Light, Prince of Peace,

22:39.892 --> 22:42.860
the divine, Almighty God.

22:42.862 --> 22:45.796
And I just speak
what He gives me to say.

22:45.798 --> 22:50.568
He smites mine enemies before me
with His terrible sword.

22:55.808 --> 22:57.475
That's me.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.444
What about you?

23:06.786 --> 23:08.519
Babe, why you so pressed?

23:08.521 --> 23:11.589
Because all of my aunts went
to the St. Josephine Cotillion.

23:11.591 --> 23:14.125
I even got a dress for it.

23:14.127 --> 23:15.893
It's in my shopping cart.

23:15.895 --> 23:18.162
- Baby...
- Yes?

23:18.164 --> 23:20.564
No fly girl of mine
will be walking around

23:20.566 --> 23:23.768
in a poofy dress at a cotillion.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.136
You're too sexy for that.

23:25.138 --> 23:29.840
It's not poofy.
And it's not just a ball.

23:29.842 --> 23:33.511
It's... it's a network. It's cool.

23:33.513 --> 23:36.113
All right, I guess it's cool

23:36.115 --> 23:38.149
if you're into it.

23:38.151 --> 23:41.652
But, we got real things to do.

23:43.456 --> 23:44.989
Don't we?

23:48.928 --> 23:50.828
And you know it was poofy.

23:53.065 --> 23:54.665
It was a little poofy.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.634
Yeah, it was. Come here.

23:59.672 --> 24:03.441
So, now I'm just waiting
to see what's next.

24:03.443 --> 24:07.478
And when you said that today,
about tackling homophobia...

24:07.480 --> 24:09.947
You thought that might be it.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.549
Definitely crossed my mind.

24:11.551 --> 24:13.818
You're like me.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.653
How so?

24:15.655 --> 24:18.189
When you figure out what
we should do, let me know.

24:18.191 --> 24:20.591
I got a feeling you're
the one with the vision.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.894
Maybe.

24:25.164 --> 24:27.698
Pastor...

24:27.700 --> 24:29.233
thank you very much
for your time.

24:29.235 --> 24:30.868
Thanks for yours.

24:40.580 --> 24:43.247
We should, check the time.

24:43.249 --> 24:45.583
You might have to jump
out the window if...

24:45.585 --> 24:47.918
I've checked. We're good.

24:53.059 --> 24:55.726
What's the matter?
We talked about it.

24:57.563 --> 25:00.531
I know we've talked about it.

25:01.901 --> 25:03.834
So let's do it.

25:03.836 --> 25:06.570
Right now? Right now?

25:06.572 --> 25:09.940
Yeah. What? You don't
wanna do it anymore?

25:09.942 --> 25:13.511
No, I want to. I'm just...

25:13.513 --> 25:16.213
Just kinda scared.

25:16.215 --> 25:17.748
Hey.

25:19.051 --> 25:20.918
Don't I always take care of you?

25:24.257 --> 25:27.157
Zora.

25:27.159 --> 25:31.095
- Do you have...
- Yes, yes.

25:31.097 --> 25:32.796
Got everything you need.

25:35.268 --> 25:36.867
Let me take care of you.

25:40.172 --> 25:41.672
Okay.

25:47.547 --> 25:50.014
And now I don't even
know where he is.

25:50.016 --> 25:52.016
I had him on my
"Find Friends" app,

25:52.018 --> 25:54.151
but he must have deleted it.

25:54.153 --> 25:58.556
So... he's just gone.

25:58.558 --> 26:00.958
I am so sorry.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.294
I wish I would have known.

26:03.296 --> 26:05.029
You know the worst part?

26:05.031 --> 26:07.731
What's that?

26:07.733 --> 26:11.969
We were too busy dealing
with the fact that Kevin was gay

26:11.971 --> 26:14.605
- and divorcing...
- Yeah?

26:14.607 --> 26:17.241
That we never even
had a chance to grieve.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.578
Your little girl.

26:22.281 --> 26:26.050
She just vanished away
inside of me,

26:26.052 --> 26:29.053
and nobody ever said
anything, like...

26:29.055 --> 26:32.656
Like it'd be rude or something.

26:34.660 --> 26:36.860
But I think about her every day.

26:38.731 --> 26:40.197
Eden Brooke.

26:42.201 --> 26:43.667
You remember her name?

26:43.669 --> 26:45.369
Of course I remember her name.

26:45.371 --> 26:48.305
I haven't heard anyone say
her name since she went away.

26:50.276 --> 26:53.744
I feel like
she's just out there,

26:53.746 --> 26:57.181
like a kite just on a string,

26:57.183 --> 26:59.116
alone in the stars.

27:00.686 --> 27:02.987
And I'm the only one holding on.

27:04.256 --> 27:09.326
And if I let go,
she'll just fly away.

27:09.328 --> 27:11.996
You can let go, Charity.

27:11.998 --> 27:14.164
I'll hold it for a while.

27:14.166 --> 27:17.267
And I never let go.

27:22.742 --> 27:24.375
I got you.

27:30.082 --> 27:32.316
I just... I don't know
how this happened.

27:32.318 --> 27:35.719
The date is right at the top
of the email, plain as day.

27:35.721 --> 27:36.887
I sent it.

27:36.889 --> 27:39.156
Maybe you did. I never got it.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.758
Well, you've got it now,
so you can either

27:40.760 --> 27:42.926
do the right thing
or I'll call Dr. Butler.

27:42.928 --> 27:46.130
Whoa, whoa, wait.
Wait a hot minute, now.

27:46.132 --> 27:47.898
What? More lies?

27:47.900 --> 27:51.769
No. You sent it
to the wrong email address.

27:53.139 --> 27:55.339
What? You don't have
anything sharp to say?

27:55.341 --> 27:57.908
Take a look.

27:57.910 --> 28:00.411
It's supposed to be
.org, not .com.

28:00.413 --> 28:03.881
But...

28:03.883 --> 28:05.449
I sent it ahead of the deadline.

28:05.451 --> 28:08.786
Yeah, well, you sent it
to somebody, not me.

28:11.123 --> 28:12.690
I'll just call Jacinta.

28:12.692 --> 28:15.693
You know Dr. Butler's
a lot more peeved at you

28:15.695 --> 28:17.961
right now than I am, right?

28:17.963 --> 28:20.264
I told her what you did,
coming in here,

28:20.266 --> 28:24.802
posing all over my shag rug
like some entitled white woman,

28:24.804 --> 28:26.970
and she apologized to me.

28:26.972 --> 28:31.075
Now... I may not be on the pages

28:31.077 --> 28:34.478
of <i> Southern Decor</i> yet,
but I will be.

28:34.480 --> 28:38.115
And as for you, Mrs. Greenleaf,

28:38.117 --> 28:41.485
you will never be featured
on there again.

28:47.493 --> 28:50.894
Yes, print these out
for the deacons.

28:50.896 --> 28:53.997
If Jacob's gonna be across the
street every Sunday sounding off,

28:53.999 --> 28:56.300
I want them to know that we're
doing what we can, too.

28:56.302 --> 28:58.469
Yes, Bishop.

28:58.471 --> 29:00.304
Who knows?

29:00.306 --> 29:03.907
Might be better for everyone
in the long run.

29:03.909 --> 29:05.209
How'd it go with Ms. Tasha?

29:05.211 --> 29:06.376
Don't ask.

29:06.378 --> 29:08.212
Love of my life.

29:11.851 --> 29:15.285
James, would you please invite
Ms. Cross to dinner tonight?

29:15.287 --> 29:17.054
Why?

29:17.056 --> 29:18.989
I need her help.

29:25.531 --> 29:28.098
I'll get right on it.

29:30.936 --> 29:34.438
I just feel terrible about the way
I behaved today at the church.

29:34.440 --> 29:38.842
First Lady, we all have days.

29:38.844 --> 29:42.946
Besides, all I do most nights
is sit at home and work.

29:42.948 --> 29:45.415
It's nice to be able to have
the chance to get out

29:45.417 --> 29:48.385
and to such an impressive home.

29:48.387 --> 29:51.121
- Do you all live here?
- No.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.857
We're over in W.C. Handy Park.

29:53.859 --> 29:56.960
Yes, that's an upandcoming area.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.395
Yeah, we love it.

29:58.397 --> 30:00.964
I don't recall
if Bishop told me,

30:00.966 --> 30:03.333
but what was
your last church home?

30:03.335 --> 30:04.968
Greater Redeemer.

30:04.970 --> 30:06.970
Reverend Kensington's church.

30:06.972 --> 30:08.505
- Yes.
- He's wonderful.

30:08.507 --> 30:11.008
Yes, he's... he's very solid.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.178
So, what made you leave?

30:14.180 --> 30:16.880
I don't know
if it's appropriate.

30:16.882 --> 30:19.116
Well, if you heard some of the
things said at this dinner table...

30:19.118 --> 30:21.585
- Ha!
- Well, if you're willing to share.

30:21.587 --> 30:24.488
Well, I, um...

30:26.025 --> 30:28.091
I had breast cancer.

30:28.093 --> 30:30.060
I'm so sorry to hear that.

30:30.062 --> 30:32.062
I am in remission now,
thank God.

30:32.064 --> 30:33.597
Praise God.

30:33.599 --> 30:36.233
But they didn't think
I was gonna pull through.

30:36.235 --> 30:39.536
And I didn't feel like
Reverend Kensington

30:39.538 --> 30:41.338
was there for me.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.040
I mean, he hardly called.

30:43.042 --> 30:44.541
He didn't visit me
in the hospital.

30:44.543 --> 30:49.179
Well, one thing that we
pride ourselves on at Calvary

30:49.181 --> 30:51.215
is our ministry
to the sick and shut in.

30:51.217 --> 30:53.517
- Yeah.
- I mean, there are nurses

30:53.519 --> 30:55.619
who see Bishop more than I do.

30:55.621 --> 30:57.955
I can imagine.

30:57.957 --> 31:00.090
That's why it's so nice
to be here at Calvary.

31:00.092 --> 31:03.293
I really feel supported.

31:08.200 --> 31:14.204
Baby, Mommy loves you so much.

31:14.206 --> 31:17.241
Just don't ever think
just because I cry sometimes

31:17.243 --> 31:20.110
about your sister
that you're not enough.

31:20.112 --> 31:24.915
You are a whole life's worth
of dreams for anybody, baby.

31:27.653 --> 31:30.320
But we would have had a lot
of fun with her, wouldn't we?

31:32.358 --> 31:35.225
We would've held her so tight.

31:35.227 --> 31:39.263
And you, you would've been
her best friend.

31:39.265 --> 31:42.132
Her best, best friend.

31:42.134 --> 31:43.400
Right?

31:45.204 --> 31:47.971
Okay, girl, I gotta
tell you something.

31:47.973 --> 31:49.506
Okay, tell me.

31:49.508 --> 31:52.342
Okay. But you can't judge me.

31:52.344 --> 31:55.312
- Why would I judge?
- Just... just promise.

31:55.314 --> 31:57.681
I promise. What is it?

31:57.683 --> 31:59.650
So, um, Isaiah came over...

31:59.652 --> 32:01.618
- Wait, Isaiah?!
- You said you wouldn't judge.

32:01.620 --> 32:04.021
- Are you guys back together now?
- Slow your roll.

32:04.023 --> 32:06.390
Yeah, Z, what is
the matter with you?

32:06.392 --> 32:08.058
Okay, stop acting like my mom.

32:08.060 --> 32:10.193
Just because Grandpa
threw you in a tub of water

32:10.195 --> 32:11.995
doesn't mean you know
what's best for everyone.

32:11.997 --> 32:13.964
<i>Comprende?</i>

32:13.966 --> 32:15.332
<i>Comprende.</i>

32:15.334 --> 32:17.167
I'm sorry.

32:17.169 --> 32:21.171
- Apology accepted.
- So, what happened?

32:26.011 --> 32:27.477
We did it.

32:29.348 --> 32:30.480
Did what?

32:30.482 --> 32:32.449
It.

32:32.451 --> 32:34.518
We did <i> it.</i>

32:34.520 --> 32:37.087
- You had sex?!
- Shh!

32:45.264 --> 32:46.530
How was it?

32:46.532 --> 32:49.733
Um... weird.

32:51.070 --> 32:53.303
Good, I think.

32:53.305 --> 32:56.573
It was just... different.

33:01.747 --> 33:04.214
But every church I tried...
And I'm not judging.

33:04.216 --> 33:06.249
I mean, believe you me,
I could never get up

33:06.251 --> 33:08.018
in front of people
the way these pastors do,

33:08.020 --> 33:11.488
but none of these pastors
really moved me, I guess.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.657
Bishop is definitely
one of a kind.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.258
The only one that came close

33:15.260 --> 33:17.561
was Pastor Skanks
over at Triumph.

33:17.563 --> 33:21.098
But something about him
strikes me as off.

33:21.100 --> 33:24.034
- I couldn't agree more.
- What makes you say that? I'm just curious.

33:24.036 --> 33:27.004
We were over at Triumph
today for a meeting,

33:27.006 --> 33:30.040
and I think my daughter here
fell under an enchantment.

33:30.042 --> 33:33.043
- What kind of enchantment?
- Nothing. It wasn't...

33:33.045 --> 33:34.611
Well...

33:36.382 --> 33:38.782
Pastor Skanks just spoke
very compellingly, I thought,

33:38.784 --> 33:40.317
about the need
for the church to take

33:40.319 --> 33:42.119
a firm stand against homophobia.

33:42.121 --> 33:45.022
So that's the donkey he's gonna
ride into Jerusalem now?

33:45.024 --> 33:46.423
- Bingo.
- What did he say?

33:46.425 --> 33:49.726
- Just... love.
- Exactly.

33:49.728 --> 33:51.728
He's such a shameless hypocrite.

33:51.730 --> 33:54.031
You don't know the half of it.

33:54.033 --> 33:55.033
Kerissa, don't.

33:56.668 --> 33:58.668
Well, what I meant was
that Jesus did preach love,

33:58.670 --> 34:00.570
- but He also preached sin.
- Amen.

34:00.572 --> 34:02.239
Basie's just grandstanding.

34:02.241 --> 34:03.640
Daddy, I'm not sure
it's grandstanding.

34:03.642 --> 34:05.175
So, what is it?

34:05.177 --> 34:07.044
Why does anyone need to have

34:07.046 --> 34:09.379
a conversation
about these things?

34:09.380 --> 34:12.681
Calvary does not discriminate
against homosexuals.

34:12.684 --> 34:15.719
What?

34:15.721 --> 34:18.655
No one asked Kevin to leave.
He left of his own free will.

34:18.657 --> 34:21.425
- Who's Kevin?
- Our exsoninlaw.

34:21.427 --> 34:23.326
And if he felt judged,

34:23.328 --> 34:25.228
that was from the well
of his soul,

34:25.230 --> 34:26.596
and a natural source.

34:26.598 --> 34:28.398
You know, I don't think
we need to be talking

34:28.400 --> 34:29.666
about any this
in front of company.

34:29.668 --> 34:32.369
No, I'm fine. I miss family.

34:32.371 --> 34:35.572
All he wants to do is take
a stand and say out loud

34:35.574 --> 34:38.108
- that God loves everybody, straight or gay.
- Yes, yes, yes!

34:38.110 --> 34:40.342
But God does not love sin,

34:40.344 --> 34:42.712
and to leave that out,
that's irresponsible.

34:42.714 --> 34:44.614
- Amen.
- And what if it wasn't Basie?

34:44.616 --> 34:46.149
What if Jacob
had said that today?

34:46.150 --> 34:48.752
- Would you hear it then?
- Gigi.

34:48.754 --> 34:52.289
Considering the toll your
righteous passion for justice

34:52.291 --> 34:55.324
has taken on this family,
even today...

34:55.327 --> 34:57.194
Kerissa, not right now.

34:57.196 --> 34:58.562
What happened today?

34:58.564 --> 35:01.098
Zora, Sophia?

35:01.100 --> 35:02.299
The cotillion?

35:12.177 --> 35:13.310
I'm sorry.

35:13.312 --> 35:14.778
Please, don't apologize.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.814
No, I need to. Jacob's right.

35:17.816 --> 35:20.617
This isn't the right time
to be arguing.

35:20.619 --> 35:23.353
- Mama, I'm sorry.
- That's all right, baby.

35:23.355 --> 35:25.489
Daddy.

35:34.199 --> 35:36.500
<i>The Sophster! You still up?</i>

35:36.502 --> 35:38.702
Yeah. Zora just went home.

35:38.704 --> 35:40.737
<i>Sam has been asking about her.</i>

35:40.739 --> 35:43.607
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

35:43.609 --> 35:46.343
<i>That's cool. Her loss.</i>

35:46.345 --> 35:48.411
Could I ask you
something personal?

35:48.413 --> 35:49.746
<i>I've been hoping you would.</i>

35:51.717 --> 35:54.151
Have you ever, like...

35:54.153 --> 35:55.352
done it?

35:55.354 --> 35:56.920
<i>Done it?</i>

35:56.922 --> 35:58.722
<i>You mean, like sex?</i>

35:58.724 --> 36:00.657
Yeah.

36:00.659 --> 36:03.460
<i>Nah. Have you?</i>

36:03.462 --> 36:04.694
No.

36:06.365 --> 36:07.531
<i>Why are you asking?</i>

36:07.533 --> 36:09.199
Just wondering.

36:15.574 --> 36:17.174
It wasn't your fault
at all, Rochelle.

36:17.176 --> 36:18.708
Grace has always been...

36:18.710 --> 36:20.377
Well, how would you put it, Mae?

36:20.379 --> 36:22.879
Constructively contentious.

36:22.881 --> 36:24.848
Well, I've heard
the same said of me.

36:24.850 --> 36:27.417
- I find that hard to believe.
- No.

36:29.788 --> 36:32.956
Might, um,
Rochelle and I have...?

36:32.958 --> 36:35.292
Of course. I'll get your coat.

36:35.294 --> 36:36.626
Thank you.

36:39.431 --> 36:41.364
Rochelle, I cannot stress enough

36:41.366 --> 36:44.701
how sorry I am for how I
behaved earlier today.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.870
It was not about you.

36:46.872 --> 36:49.573
First Lady, I wasn't
offended in the least.

36:49.575 --> 36:51.608
I was more concerned.

36:51.610 --> 36:53.543
You're so kind.

36:53.545 --> 36:56.279
But you did say something
earlier today,

36:56.281 --> 36:58.682
before I put my foot in it,

36:58.684 --> 37:00.550
that I did want to follow up on.

37:00.552 --> 37:03.353
After that dinner?

37:03.355 --> 37:05.322
Yeah, you mentioned
Jacinta Butler.

37:05.324 --> 37:08.925
Yes. She is one of the
few clients that I have

37:08.927 --> 37:10.994
that I actually
consider a friend.

37:10.996 --> 37:13.663
She, far more
than Reverend Kensington,

37:13.665 --> 37:15.532
was the one that helped me

37:15.534 --> 37:17.634
through some of my
hardest days in chemo.

37:17.636 --> 37:20.604
She is an undeniable saint.

37:20.606 --> 37:23.573
What can I do? How can I help?

37:23.575 --> 37:26.810
Well, it seems that I made,

37:26.812 --> 37:31.248
during one of the most difficult
chapters of my own travails,

37:31.250 --> 37:33.483
what my mother would call...

37:35.520 --> 37:37.387
an "overlooktion."

37:44.596 --> 37:46.896
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mama.

37:50.402 --> 37:51.501
Thanks.

37:51.503 --> 37:53.270
Morning, ma'am.

38:02.581 --> 38:05.949
It's not your fault, dear.

38:05.951 --> 38:07.484
What?

38:07.486 --> 38:10.520
This mess with the cotillion.

38:10.522 --> 38:13.923
You can't know that committee didn't look
at the paper before they voted, Mom.

38:13.925 --> 38:18.061
- You can't know that.
- I sent the nomination to the wrong email.

38:18.063 --> 38:19.629
They never got it.

38:20.832 --> 38:22.299
How do you know?

38:22.301 --> 38:25.902
Someone told me, and it's true.

38:25.904 --> 38:28.505
I'm the guilty party.

38:28.507 --> 38:31.074
It's not... you.

38:33.945 --> 38:35.478
For once.

38:37.349 --> 38:39.316
And it turns out that Rochelle

38:39.318 --> 38:42.852
has this backchannel pull
with Jacinta.

38:42.854 --> 38:47.957
Let's just see if she is as
influential as she says she is.

38:49.394 --> 38:51.861
We got... we got in!

38:51.863 --> 38:53.430
To the...?

38:53.432 --> 38:54.831
Yeah, Zora and I
both just got emails

38:54.833 --> 38:55.965
saying that
there was some mixup.

38:55.967 --> 38:57.734
That's great!

38:57.736 --> 38:59.669
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!

38:59.671 --> 39:02.706
- You see?
- What happened?

39:02.708 --> 39:04.708
Well, your grandmother
made some calls.

39:04.710 --> 39:06.543
Thank you so much, Grandma.

39:06.545 --> 39:08.712
You are very welcome.

39:08.714 --> 39:12.682
And you are very deserving.

39:12.684 --> 39:15.952
You see? I told you
it was a mistake.

39:15.954 --> 39:20.023
Both of you,
but nobody ever listens.

39:20.025 --> 39:21.658
- Bring it in, come on.
- Mwah!

39:21.660 --> 39:23.593
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

39:27.933 --> 39:29.699
Wow.

39:32.037 --> 39:34.404
Okay, well, I'm gonna go
get ready for work.

39:37.943 --> 39:39.642
Mama, thank you for telling me.

39:39.644 --> 39:42.145
And thank you
for not judging me.

39:42.147 --> 39:44.647
And I'm glad that this Rochelle
could help us, but, Mama...

39:44.649 --> 39:46.082
I know, honey.

39:48.086 --> 39:50.820
We'll fight that fight
when it comes.

40:03.135 --> 40:04.734
Maricel?

40:06.571 --> 40:07.871
Yes, ma'am?

40:07.873 --> 40:10.607
Please take that down
and store it.

40:13.612 --> 40:15.295
Yes, ma'am.

40:15.296 --> 40:16.979
In fact, send every painting
by that artist

40:16.982 --> 40:18.548
to the gallery.

40:18.550 --> 40:19.816
Yes, ma'am.

40:26.057 --> 40:28.458
It's time for a change.

41:26.985 --> 41:28.785
What do you think?

41:30.856 --> 41:32.489
I think that's a hit.
