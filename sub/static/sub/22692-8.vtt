WEBVTT

00:58.400 --> 01:00.520
-Yes.
-Thank you.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.480
Greetings. Thank you so much.

01:04.480 --> 01:07.200
-Hello, everybody.
-Thank you.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.360
Thank you.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.160
Whoa! Hello. Thank you.

01:11.240 --> 01:14.240
Thank you so much.

01:14.280 --> 01:16.960
JEREMY: Thank you,
thank you, thank you.
-Thank you.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.560
Thank you. Welcome.

01:19.600 --> 01:24.800
And in this show, apart from
James's weird jacket
and T-shirt combination...

01:24.840 --> 01:26.640
-Nothing to be
proud of, mate.
-No, it isn't.

01:26.680 --> 01:29.960
...we have many other
things besides.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.320
JEREMY:
James May changes gear.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.640
Richard Hammond changes gear.

01:38.040 --> 01:39.440
And I...

01:45.240 --> 01:46.480
..change gear.

01:47.680 --> 01:49.600
-Thank you.

01:51.440 --> 01:54.360
It's all very exciting.

01:54.400 --> 01:57.840
But we start in the 1950s,
when James May
was an old man.

01:59.840 --> 02:03.400
Now, back then,
Jaguar won Le Mans
three times with the D-Type.

02:03.440 --> 02:05.120
And after they retired
that from racing,

02:05.160 --> 02:08.520
they decided to build
25 road-going versions of it,

02:08.560 --> 02:10.720
which they called the XKSS.

02:10.760 --> 02:12.640
We've got a photograph
of one here.

02:12.680 --> 02:16.120
Now, this was aimed
at wealthy young gentlemen

02:16.160 --> 02:18.720
who wanted to spend the week
dashing around town

02:18.760 --> 02:21.640
and then the weekend
doing motor racing.

02:21.680 --> 02:25.840
Steve McQueen had one,
and I think that says it all.

02:25.880 --> 02:30.080
Unfortunately,
in 1957 there was
a huge fire at the factory,

02:30.120 --> 02:35.480
and nine of those 25 cars
were never made& until now.

02:51.960 --> 02:54.840
Let me make one thing plain
right from the start -

02:54.880 --> 02:59.840
this is not a replica XKSS
built from plastic,

02:59.880 --> 03:02.040
this is an XKSS.

03:08.400 --> 03:14.080
Built by Jaguar themselves
over 10,000 painstaking
hours, it's the real deal.

03:16.520 --> 03:20.480
In fact, it's as real
as the real ones
from way back when.

03:31.640 --> 03:35.760
The chassis is made from
a special steel
called Reynolds 531.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.760
It's what they
originally used to build
the World War II Spitfire.

03:38.800 --> 03:41.840
And it's light -
it only weighs 39kg.

03:41.880 --> 03:43.960
And then there's the body.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
The tooling and
the technical drawings were
all destroyed in the fire,

03:47.040 --> 03:50.160
so they had to scan
an original from 1957

03:50.200 --> 03:52.960
and then work backwards
from that to make it,

03:53.000 --> 03:55.440
in incredible detail,
right down to the rivets.

03:55.480 --> 03:59.160
Every one, the number and
the position is as it was.

03:59.200 --> 04:02.080
And there's
over 2,000 of them.

04:02.120 --> 04:05.960
But it was the engine
that was the trickiest bit.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.600
The plans for that weren't
destroyed in the fire -

04:08.640 --> 04:13.240
in fact, I've got
a copy of them here -
but there was a page missing.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.240
So they had to get
an original engine

04:15.280 --> 04:18.400
and saw it in half
to find out how it worked.

04:20.480 --> 04:24.240
No-one has ever made
a car like this before.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.560
It's a world first.

04:26.600 --> 04:32.440
So it's small wonder
it's priced at just over
one million pounds.

04:35.480 --> 04:38.640
Or, for half a million pounds
more,

04:38.680 --> 04:40.480
you can have one of these!

04:45.280 --> 04:49.920
It's an Aston Martin DB4
GT Lightweight.

04:49.960 --> 04:55.120
And back in the late '50s,
it was the fastest car
in the world.

04:56.480 --> 05:00.760
Flat out, it would do 151mph.

05:08.160 --> 05:12.120
But this is not
from the late '50s.

05:12.160 --> 05:15.720
Despite what you might think
when you look at
its period dashboard

05:15.760 --> 05:19.560
and its period six-cylinder
twin-spark engine,

05:19.600 --> 05:22.720
it was actually built
a few weeks ago.

05:24.520 --> 05:26.280
So, like Hammond's Jag,

05:26.320 --> 05:32.000
it's an old car that's
brand-spanking-new.

05:32.040 --> 05:36.880
-So did these two ever race
against each other in period?
-No, they did! They did!

05:36.920 --> 05:39.720
May, 1960,
I was a month old--

05:39.760 --> 05:42.640
-I was ten years off
being born, mate.
-Yeah, whatever.

05:42.680 --> 05:45.320
-Picture of it here, look.
-Oh, look! There they are!

05:45.360 --> 05:47.520
JEREMY:
It's actually a D-Type.
RICHARD: The race version.

05:47.560 --> 05:49.760
JEREMY: Yeah, exactly.
DB4 GT Lightweight.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.960
I mean, that was proper
racing in those days.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.440
-No stewards enquiries
every time there was a bump.
-No.

05:54.480 --> 05:58.320
They would just finish
the race, have a drink,
and then some sex.

05:58.360 --> 06:00.120
We should give it a bash.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.400
What, sex?

06:03.840 --> 06:05.120
-No.
-No.

06:07.040 --> 06:10.080
JEREMY: Happily, we were
in the French town of Pau,

06:10.120 --> 06:15.760
and it was here in 1901
the first ever Grand Prix
was staged.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.080
They were closing roads
for races here

06:21.120 --> 06:26.240
long before they thought
of doing the same thing
in Monaco or Detroit.

06:29.320 --> 06:32.440
And today they were
closed once more...

06:34.040 --> 06:35.080
..for us.

06:47.680 --> 06:49.160
Oh, look at this!

06:50.720 --> 06:53.920
Closed roads through
the centre of Pau. Oh!

06:55.600 --> 06:58.760
Oh, my God! This is like
being in history.

07:02.280 --> 07:07.280
This may have
the same Italian styling
as the original,

07:07.320 --> 07:13.000
but unlike Hammond's Jag,
it is not a faithful replica.

07:13.040 --> 07:17.320
It has, for example, a bigger
engine than the original,

07:17.360 --> 07:19.480
which means
40 more brake horsepower.

07:19.520 --> 07:22.000
This thing...
This thing is quick!

07:23.280 --> 07:25.640
Whoa! Really quick!

07:31.400 --> 07:33.680
Some things
are the same, though.

07:33.720 --> 07:37.800
Windows don't wind down.
There's no fan or air
conditioning of any kind,

07:37.840 --> 07:41.000
and it's got
a racing gearbox.

07:41.040 --> 07:44.920
That means no synchros.

07:44.960 --> 07:48.600
Which means that when
you want to slow down,
you have to heel and toe.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.760
Like that. Yes!

07:53.680 --> 07:56.520
That was a skill
I never thought
I'd need to use again,

07:56.560 --> 07:58.280
a bit like changing
a typewriter ribbon.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.920
Whoa! That was&

08:03.960 --> 08:06.800
That was me
not matching the revs up,

08:06.840 --> 08:09.640
and that was it
not forgiving me.

08:11.440 --> 08:14.520
The really good news,
though, is the...

08:16.360 --> 08:18.520
..is the brakes.

08:18.560 --> 08:23.200
They're made using
modern materials,
unlike in Hammond's Jag.

08:24.880 --> 08:28.120
Yep, in here it's just me
and my big, hairy balls.

08:29.680 --> 08:31.840
And they need to be big.

08:31.880 --> 08:35.920
I can only brake when
I'm accelerating. Seriously.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.120
The power for the brakes
comes off the gearbox,

08:38.160 --> 08:40.560
so with the clutch in
there isn't any.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.480
Who thought
that was a good idea?

08:45.440 --> 08:51.000
Right, time to unleash
the 3.4L straight-six.

08:51.040 --> 08:55.440
That's 262 brake horsepower
bouncing off the walls.

09:00.960 --> 09:07.160
In the '50s, Ferraris
were hitting 160
on the Mulsanne Straight.

09:07.200 --> 09:10.640
Jaguar D-Types
were hitting 172.

09:10.680 --> 09:13.360
And remember, this is,
essentially, a D-Type.

09:27.640 --> 09:28.920
JEREMY: Whoa!

09:30.000 --> 09:32.840
Just feel the lack of grip.

09:32.880 --> 09:36.840
Of course, back in the '50s
cars didn't grip,

09:36.880 --> 09:39.800
because they had
cross-ply tyres.

09:39.840 --> 09:42.280
Back then it was all about
how a car handled,

09:42.320 --> 09:45.880
and this thing handles
absolutely beautifully.

09:48.400 --> 09:51.240
Come on, Hammond,
get out of my way!

09:56.720 --> 09:59.920
RICHARD: This really is
a special moment.

09:59.960 --> 10:03.640
Just to see these two cars
racing around here
is incredible.

10:03.680 --> 10:06.600
To be in one of them
is unreal!

10:11.680 --> 10:14.680
JEREMY: This is one of the
best mornings I've ever had

10:14.720 --> 10:17.640
behind the wheel
of a car, ever.

10:17.680 --> 10:20.280
And it's just brilliant fun!

10:23.040 --> 10:26.680
JEREMY: Eventually,
though, the people of Pau
wanted their town back,

10:26.720 --> 10:29.600
so Hammond and I called time
on the fun and games

10:29.640 --> 10:34.040
and sat down for a natter
about our amazing cars.

10:35.680 --> 10:39.240
Now, we should explain why
Aston Martin and Jaguar

10:39.280 --> 10:43.120
have suddenly decided
to start making cars
from their back catalogue.

10:43.160 --> 10:46.400
-And really, well, it's
second
-Well, basically, yeah.

10:46.440 --> 10:51.440
The last genuine
original XKSS to sell
went for over £12 million.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.680
-Twelve million.

10:53.720 --> 10:56.880
So anyone who buys that
for a million is getting
the bargain of the century.

10:56.920 --> 10:59.080
Yep.

10:59.120 --> 11:01.960
And Jaguar's
making more profit on that
than it would from selling...

11:02.000 --> 11:04.320
RICHARD: A hundred XEs.
JEREMY: Exactly.

11:04.360 --> 11:07.160
I wouldn't be at all
surprised if other carmakers
don't start doing this:

11:07.200 --> 11:10.800
Ferrari, Maserati,
Lamborghini.

11:10.840 --> 11:13.960
If Lancia remade
the Fulvia now&

11:14.000 --> 11:15.720
I know, I'd love one.

11:15.760 --> 11:19.360
I'd rather have that
than one of those.

11:19.400 --> 11:21.440
JEREMY: Is that the new
Honda Civic Type R?

11:21.480 --> 11:23.640
-The new-new one,
and it is hideous.
-It is, honestly&

11:23.680 --> 11:26.040
It's worse than
the last one. It's awful!

11:26.080 --> 11:30.120
I mean, the original '90s
Civic Type R was brilliant,
but that is disgusting.

11:30.160 --> 11:32.200
It's revolting is what it is.

11:32.240 --> 11:35.960
Mind you,
it's not as revolting...

11:36.000 --> 11:37.920
-...as what's
just got out of it.

11:37.960 --> 11:39.720
RICHARD: Oh, God.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.880
JEREMY: Why are you here?

11:41.920 --> 11:46.680
I'm here because I heard
that you two were talking
complete rubbish.

11:46.720 --> 11:49.400
You don't buy
an old black-and-white
television set,

11:49.440 --> 11:51.320
you don't buy
a Bakelite telephone.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.760
-Why would you buy
an old car?
-Because they're stylish.

11:53.800 --> 11:57.640
No, new stuff is better
than old stuff. I've
explained this to you before.

11:57.680 --> 12:01.560
The world now is better than
it was just one minute ago.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.400
No, it isn't, because a
minute ago you weren't here.

12:04.440 --> 12:07.560
Yeah, that's true.
And neither was that thing,
and I do hate it.

12:07.600 --> 12:11.160
It just... That's one of
the most revolting cars
I've ever seen.

12:11.200 --> 12:14.840
You see, that's amazing -
you're both talking
rubbish again.

12:14.880 --> 12:19.440
JAMES: To prove it,
I suggested we take our cars
for a simple evening drive.

12:20.880 --> 12:22.960
Got to get my leg in.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.720
Right, here I go.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.880
Oh, that's backwards.
No, I don't want backwards.

12:39.720 --> 12:41.920
That's neutral, so&

12:45.600 --> 12:47.960
-There, first.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.760
No, that's still... Oh.

12:51.160 --> 12:52.880
What are they doing?

13:00.240 --> 13:02.240
-Struggling a bit here.
-No, it's&

13:02.280 --> 13:04.320
-Pulling away is an event.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.680
-Ooh!
-That was a gear, I think.

13:11.360 --> 13:16.000
JAMES: Finally,
the golden-age-of-motoring
duo were on the move,

13:16.040 --> 13:18.840
but not at what you would
call "a hell of a lick".

13:23.360 --> 13:27.160
It's like driving around
behind the National Trust.

13:27.200 --> 13:30.440
I wouldn't be surprised
to find there's a souvenir
shop in Hammond's car.

13:30.480 --> 13:34.120
You have to go through it
as you get out.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.040
Why are we going so slowly?

13:36.080 --> 13:38.840
I want to savour the car
and the weather
and the journey.

13:38.880 --> 13:42.600
I don't want to rush this
one. I want to... go slowly.

13:42.640 --> 13:45.600
-Exactly.
We want to make it last.
-Exactly.

13:47.600 --> 13:50.880
I should admit the real
reason we're driving slowly

13:50.920 --> 13:56.840
is because this part of
the French motorway network
is... very heavily policed.

13:56.880 --> 13:59.720
Hammond and I
know this to our cost.

13:59.760 --> 14:04.240
A couple of years ago we were
driving along here and I was
in an Aston Martin then.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.640
Got busted
by the constabulary,

14:06.680 --> 14:09.240
who helped themselves
to all of our money

14:09.280 --> 14:13.200
and took our driving licences
away on the spot.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.640
We were left stranded
at the side of the road.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.440
I could have been raped...
or murdered.

14:21.720 --> 14:23.040
That gives me an idea.

14:24.320 --> 14:26.680
James May...

14:26.720 --> 14:30.760
I'd love to see how fast
your car could go along here.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.880
Yeah, let's see what
that thing can do. Come on.

14:35.920 --> 14:39.520
I want you to unleash - how
many horsepower is it, 320?

14:39.560 --> 14:42.360
Unleash the lot, James!

14:42.400 --> 14:46.360
-Right, I'll come past like a
bloodied samurai. Watch this.

14:46.400 --> 14:49.360
Oh, yes! He's buying it!

14:49.400 --> 14:54.080
JAMES: Having dropped back,
I then showed them
what this car can do.

14:57.600 --> 15:00.760
Here he comes,
ladies and gentlemen
of the police force.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.640
Oh, wow!

15:02.680 --> 15:04.120
Goodbye, Heritage Britain.

15:05.480 --> 15:07.640
I reckon
it's got more to give.

15:07.680 --> 15:11.160
Go on, James! Go on!
Keep your foot in it, man!

15:16.760 --> 15:19.080
At the speed
he's now travelling,

15:19.120 --> 15:23.360
by nightfall
he'll be in a cell
with Pierre Le Burglar.

15:26.880 --> 15:30.440
JEREMY: Annoyingly,
though, when we arrived
at the overnight hotel...

15:31.520 --> 15:33.440
Oh, for God's sake!

15:33.480 --> 15:36.640
..it turned out he'd got away
with his recklessness.

15:43.280 --> 15:44.600
-No.

15:44.640 --> 15:47.960
My car's got no roof
and no locks.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.480
I can't...
I can't leave it unattended.

15:51.520 --> 15:54.240
You have got a point,
because the police
are more bothered around here

15:54.280 --> 15:56.160
with speeding
than they are with crime.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.880
Exactly.

15:57.920 --> 16:00.600
-No.

16:00.640 --> 16:02.280
God, you're
completely screwed.

16:17.360 --> 16:18.680
JEREMY: I tell you what&

16:22.200 --> 16:24.960
I did get to grips with
the gear changing in the end.

16:25.000 --> 16:29.440
I did need a shower after
that day when I got to my
hotel room, I'll tell you.

16:29.480 --> 16:31.560
-Yes, I did.

16:31.600 --> 16:36.600
Because I spent all day
sharing a small metal box
with a 4.2L radiator

16:36.640 --> 16:38.960
in the South of France,
in the summer.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.720
Honestly, my butt crack was--

16:40.760 --> 16:43.560
We don't need to talk about
your butt crack now, please.

16:43.600 --> 16:46.320
What? I'm just saying
it was like the Colorado
River down there.

16:46.360 --> 16:49.680
Yeah, OK. We'll come back
to that later. Not that.

16:49.720 --> 16:52.680
We are actually
coming back to that later.
Sweating like a pig.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.960
But there are other things
in there, too.

16:55.000 --> 17:00.240
But right now it is time to
ring the doorbell of debate
on the house of chat,

17:00.280 --> 17:03.080
located on
Conversation Street.

17:12.320 --> 17:13.320
Erm...

17:14.480 --> 17:15.920
Where shall we begin?

17:15.960 --> 17:18.480
What conversation
shall we have? Oh, I know!

17:18.520 --> 17:21.560
Do you remember
a while back we were asked
to vote on the name

17:21.600 --> 17:23.760
of that new, very serious
Antarctic research vessel,

17:23.800 --> 17:26.720
and we all decided we wanted
to call it Boaty McBoatface?

17:26.760 --> 17:28.760
-Yes.

17:28.800 --> 17:30.960
The authorities
were very angry with us
for that, and they said...

17:31.000 --> 17:33.600
I thought actually that we'd
never be consulted again

17:33.640 --> 17:36.120
because the public can't be
trusted to be sensible.

17:36.160 --> 17:40.600
Well, news from my hometown,
Doncaster, OK?
Anyone from Doncaster?

17:40.640 --> 17:43.840
-Are you actually from
Doncaster? You'll like this.

17:43.880 --> 17:45.880
-It's actually news
from Doncaster, OK?

17:45.920 --> 17:48.600
The council
has decided to risk it, OK?

17:48.640 --> 17:52.120
And they asked the people of
Doncaster to vote on a name

17:52.160 --> 17:55.480
for two new
sort of snowplough
road-gritter things.

17:57.440 --> 17:59.280
Would you like
to hear suggestions
people have come up with?

17:59.320 --> 18:01.520
-Yes, please, Jeremy,
we would.
-Here we go.

18:01.560 --> 18:04.320
-Grit Van Dyke.

18:04.360 --> 18:07.080
-True Grit, Rule Gritannia.
-I like that.

18:07.120 --> 18:09.360
-Salt Disney.
-I see what they've done.

18:09.400 --> 18:12.360
These are the names
they've chosen. One of them
is going to be called

18:12.400 --> 18:15.360
Gritsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny
Yellow Anti-Slip Machiney.

18:17.280 --> 18:20.560
The other one, though,
is going to be called
David Plowie.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.320
That doesn't work.

18:22.360 --> 18:24.320
I think they were hoping we'd
think it was David Plowie,

18:24.360 --> 18:26.720
but it isn't,
it's David Plowie -
it doesn't work.

18:26.760 --> 18:29.800
-As in snowplough. No.
-Well, that would work in
Birmingham, wouldn't it?

18:29.840 --> 18:31.920
"I'll get the snowplough out.

18:31.960 --> 18:34.200
All right, we'll call it
David Plowie, then."

18:35.840 --> 18:38.000
The marvellous thing is
the council, OK, they said,

18:38.040 --> 18:40.440
"This vote cheered
the whole of Britain up."

18:40.480 --> 18:42.720
Well, it hasn't
cheered me up.

18:42.760 --> 18:45.040
And the man from the council
said, "It's got people
interested in gritting."

18:45.080 --> 18:47.040
Well, it just hasn't, has it?

18:47.080 --> 18:49.480
We would be
interested in gritting
if we'd thought of a name.

18:49.520 --> 18:52.440
Yeah, well, we'd just call it
Gary Gritter, wouldn't we?
Let's be honest.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.680
Or maybe Ice-ish.
That could work.

18:55.720 --> 18:57.880
JEREMY: Yeah.

18:57.920 --> 19:00.920
Gary Gritter or Ice-ish:
do we think those are better
names...? Oh, hang on.

19:00.960 --> 19:02.600
-Adolf Gritler.
-Perfect!

19:02.640 --> 19:05.000
RICHARD:
Those are better names.

19:05.040 --> 19:07.640
JEREMY: That's a good one.
-They like that. Yeah,
that works. That's good.

19:07.680 --> 19:11.360
Which shall we have? Shall we
go with Itsy Bitsy and the
other one or our names?

19:11.400 --> 19:14.440
Hands up. Hands up.

19:14.480 --> 19:16.720
-That was a vote, Doncaster.
RICHARD: Yeah.

19:16.760 --> 19:19.720
-It's just what
it's gonna have to be.
-Gary and Adolf the gritters.

19:21.680 --> 19:24.160
Right, the organisers
of the Formula E
motor racing series -

19:24.200 --> 19:26.520
which is like Formula 1,
but for electric cars -

19:26.560 --> 19:30.240
they recently staged a race
between one of their cars
and a cheetah.

19:30.280 --> 19:34.360
Now, we've got a shot
from the video
they took of it here.

19:34.400 --> 19:37.200
Now, let me ask you two
a question, right?

19:37.240 --> 19:40.600
The cheetah's top speed
is 70mph.

19:40.640 --> 19:45.160
The car's top speed
is 140mph. So which one
do you think won?

19:45.200 --> 19:47.480
-Yes, it was.

19:47.520 --> 19:50.600
Wow! So the mechanical device
with a higher top speed
beat the bewildered animal

19:50.640 --> 19:52.440
that didn't know
what was going on?

19:53.920 --> 19:56.960
Literally the most pointless
race in history.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.920
Yeah, it was basically
an exercise in not
running over a cheetah.

20:01.960 --> 20:04.280
-Do you know, I was following
a pigeon the other day.

20:04.320 --> 20:06.440
Is this a new job?
Have you opened an agency?

20:06.480 --> 20:10.520
Jeremy Clarkson PD:
pigeon detective.
It's gonna be brilliant.

20:10.560 --> 20:12.640
Did its partner think it was
cheating? "Follow him!"

20:12.680 --> 20:14.440
No, I was just following--

20:14.480 --> 20:16.720
Every time it stopped,
did you have to read
a newspaper,

20:16.760 --> 20:19.480
and then look for its
reflection in a shop window?

20:19.520 --> 20:22.280
-I was merely following--
-Anyway, you should have just
gone to Trafalgar Square.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.560
-That's where they go.

20:24.600 --> 20:28.400
I was merely driving up my
drive, and a pigeon was
flying along in front of me,

20:28.440 --> 20:31.400
and I clocked it,
and it was doing 35mph.

20:31.440 --> 20:33.720
-Yeah.

20:33.760 --> 20:36.440
That's another animal that
would lose a race against
a Formula E car, then,

20:36.480 --> 20:38.360
because that does 140.

20:38.400 --> 20:40.640
It had nothing
to do with running
a private detective agency.

20:40.680 --> 20:42.640
But you are running
a private detective agency?

20:42.680 --> 20:44.560
I was simply
following a pigeon!
It wasn't that interesting!

20:44.600 --> 20:46.760
Anyway,
the essence of it is--

20:46.800 --> 20:49.240
Did you follow it
into a tree? Because that
would have been really risky.

20:49.280 --> 20:53.120
No, the essence of it is
if your animal
does less than 140mph,

20:53.160 --> 20:55.560
it will lose the race
against the Formula E car.

20:55.600 --> 20:58.680
If it does more than...
Well, no animal
does more than 140.

20:58.720 --> 21:01.360
It does. A peregrine falcon
does. It does 220.

21:01.400 --> 21:04.120
What if you have to follow
one of those?

21:04.160 --> 21:08.040
-"I can't take the case, I'm
afraid. I'll need a new car."

21:08.080 --> 21:12.040
Lamborghini has come up with
a new four-by-four. We've got
a picture of it here.

21:12.080 --> 21:14.880
-Amazing-looking thing.
Fabulous, actually.
RICHARD: It does look good.

21:14.920 --> 21:18.840
JEREMY: Make no mistake.
Twin-turbo V8, which will be
an Audi or a Porsche engine.

21:18.880 --> 21:21.920
Er... Six hundred
and forty-one horsepower.

21:21.960 --> 21:25.360
The only problem is
they've called it the Urus.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.800
-Yeah.

21:27.840 --> 21:31.480
Well, that... That sounds
to me like another word
for bumhole.

21:31.520 --> 21:34.640
-I know what you mean.
It is a bit medical-sounding.

21:34.680 --> 21:37.160
It is. "How is your Urus?"
"It's a bit itchy, actually."

21:39.640 --> 21:41.600
"Mine's inflamed.
I can't pee." It's one
of those things, isn't it?

21:41.640 --> 21:44.200
-It's something down there.
-Exactly, down there.

21:44.240 --> 21:47.600
When you go to the doctor's,
"I'm gonna check your Urus,"
and then he puts a glove on.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.720
"Oh, he's snapping a glove
on. I don't want that."

21:50.760 --> 21:53.080
Anyway, so if you want
one of those, there it is.

21:53.120 --> 21:57.240
Ooh! Can I just talk about
the Ford F150 pickup truck,
OK?

21:57.280 --> 22:00.920
Now, how many do you think
they sell in America?

22:00.960 --> 22:05.040
-I know it's a lot.
-A lot. It's 2,500 a day.

22:05.080 --> 22:06.520
-A day.

22:06.560 --> 22:08.520
-That's new - new F150s.
-That's huge numbers.

22:08.560 --> 22:12.160
And Ford
has decided, amazingly,
they would like to sell more,

22:12.200 --> 22:15.600
so they're about to introduce
a hybrid version.

22:15.640 --> 22:18.760
JAMES: Really?
Yes,
a hybrid F150 pickup truck.

22:18.800 --> 22:22.920
I can't imagine
that F150 owners
are very interested in a hy--

22:22.960 --> 22:25.440
-I don't think
they know what it is.
-They wouldn't.

22:25.480 --> 22:29.200
You're dead right. They've
actually done some research
over there in America land,

22:29.240 --> 22:32.920
and it turns out that F150
customers, when asked,

22:32.960 --> 22:38.320
list fuel consumption as the
28th most important thing in
their buying consideration.

22:38.360 --> 22:41.160
There are 27 things
they would think about first
on the car?

22:41.200 --> 22:44.120
-Yeah,
27 more important things.

22:44.160 --> 22:46.280
I can't think
of 27 things on a car.

22:46.320 --> 22:48.320
Well, hold on. Looks...

22:48.360 --> 22:50.720
MAN: Cupholders.
-Cupholders, definitely.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.360
-Yes, that works.
JEREMY: Power.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.080
-Power.
-Price.

22:54.120 --> 22:56.080
-The size of the load bay
thing at the back.
-Yeah.

22:56.120 --> 22:58.160
MAN: Gun rack.

22:58.200 --> 23:00.040
MAN: Gun rack.

23:00.080 --> 23:02.440
-Gun rack!
"Somewhere for my gun!"

23:02.480 --> 23:04.520
Six. Definitely gun rack.

23:04.560 --> 23:07.680
If they're saying that fuel
consumption doesn't matter -

23:07.720 --> 23:09.480
which is what
those owners are saying -

23:09.520 --> 23:11.400
why, then, are Ford
making a hybrid at all?

23:11.440 --> 23:13.920
-Ah, well, now--

23:13.960 --> 23:16.960
No, they've got to. It's
because of the environmental
rules that Obama brought in.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.160
All the companies
have to do a certain...

23:19.200 --> 23:22.520
But Ford are saying
the batteries that are part
of the hybrid system, OK,

23:22.560 --> 23:26.640
they're not some Communist
Bloc to combat fake news,
global warming.

23:26.680 --> 23:28.880
OK, it's got batteries
in it, yes,

23:28.920 --> 23:31.920
but they are for charging up
your mitre saw,

23:31.960 --> 23:35.280
cooling beer and running
the coffeemaker
on a camping trip.

23:36.640 --> 23:39.120
So the F150 is a pickup

23:39.160 --> 23:42.840
for carrying a big battery
to cool your beer.

23:42.880 --> 23:46.200
And that... I think that
is enough conversation
for one week, don't you?

23:46.240 --> 23:48.760
-More than, yes.
-So let's move it on. Erm...

23:48.800 --> 23:52.240
Right, the new Ford GT.
I used one recently
in the race we had

23:52.280 --> 23:55.240
from New York
to the Niagara Falls.

23:55.280 --> 23:59.600
And I'm not sure that on
a freeway journey like that
I got the best out of it.

23:59.640 --> 24:01.600
Yeah, you chose
the wrong car.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.800
-Well, not really.
-No, he's right, you did.

24:03.840 --> 24:05.920
Well, the GT
was designed as a racing car.

24:05.960 --> 24:08.440
In fact, it won the first
time out at Le Mans,

24:08.480 --> 24:11.440
and therefore, as we know,
using one on the street
is stupid.

24:11.480 --> 24:15.640
-So you're saying I should
have tested it on a track?
-Yes.

24:15.680 --> 24:17.000
Good, because I have done.

24:29.120 --> 24:31.520
JEREMY: There are those
who say that, on a track,

24:31.560 --> 24:35.880
the pretty-boy GT is better
than anything made in Europe.

24:35.920 --> 24:38.480
That it's more exciting
than all of its rivals

24:38.520 --> 24:41.880
from Lamborghini
and McLaren... and Ferrari.

24:43.480 --> 24:47.880
Well, before I can find out,
I have to stop.

24:47.920 --> 24:51.720
Right, now we're stationary,
I can put it in track mode...

24:53.000 --> 24:55.240
..which will lower
the car gently.

24:55.280 --> 24:57.680
-Not that gently.

24:57.720 --> 25:01.240
It will engage the anti-lag
system so the power
is always available,

25:01.280 --> 25:06.880
raise the rear wing,
and stiffen the suspension
by 100%.

25:06.920 --> 25:10.680
Good. So,
now let's see what's what.

25:23.120 --> 25:28.080
The first thing I can tell
you is this is not
as delicate as a Ferrari.

25:29.360 --> 25:32.080
Ferrari is balletic.

25:32.120 --> 25:35.680
This is more like
pogo-dancing to The Ramones.

25:42.080 --> 25:46.360
This is hard and brutal
and unrefined.

25:46.400 --> 25:51.720
When you're
in a Ferrari, it's like
you're wrapped in silk.

25:51.760 --> 25:56.680
In this, it feels like
you've fallen into a saw
at a lumberyard.

26:04.360 --> 26:10.880
Don't think, however, that
it's just a barroom brawler -
all doors and no trousers.

26:10.920 --> 26:13.240
It is way more than that.

26:19.960 --> 26:23.960
The steering's brilliant,
the brakes are brilliant.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.360
You get
the very distinct impression

26:26.400 --> 26:29.600
that nothing in this
has really been compromised

26:29.640 --> 26:32.720
to make it work elegantly
on the road.

26:32.760 --> 26:38.120
This is a car for people who
wear Nomex, not spandex.

26:40.800 --> 26:45.360
It's like the chassis's
made from pure telepathy.

26:45.400 --> 26:47.680
You can absolutely
wring its neck...

26:49.240 --> 26:51.360
..and it just keeps
coming back for more.

26:54.560 --> 26:57.240
Why can't more cars
feel like this?

27:06.920 --> 27:10.400
Then there's the
twin-turbocharged V6 engine.

27:11.880 --> 27:15.040
Yes, the soundtrack
is terrible.

27:15.080 --> 27:16.840
It just makes a noise.

27:18.920 --> 27:22.320
A lot of noise...
all of the time.

27:28.760 --> 27:32.480
And it only produces
647 horsepower,

27:32.520 --> 27:37.240
which in this
day and age is a lot,
but it's not a colossal lot.

27:39.120 --> 27:43.520
You can't help thinking
a thumping great V8

27:43.560 --> 27:45.840
would have solved
both of these problems.

27:50.840 --> 27:53.440
But they didn't want
a thumping great V8

27:53.480 --> 27:57.000
because they wanted
the GT to be liked.

27:57.040 --> 28:02.680
That's why it has
a carbon-fibre tub
and an aluminium subframe.

28:02.720 --> 28:08.120
It's designed to be kept on
the ground only by the weight
coming from its aerodynamics.

28:10.400 --> 28:12.720
If you take that weight
out of the equation

28:12.760 --> 28:14.920
by putting the car
in V-Max mode,

28:14.960 --> 28:17.400
which locks
the rear wing down,

28:17.440 --> 28:19.280
well, who cares
it's only got a V6?

28:19.320 --> 28:24.320
Because the performance,
it is blistering.

28:24.360 --> 28:27.880
Nought to 60
takes 2.8 seconds.

28:29.360 --> 28:30.920
Jesus Christ!

28:33.040 --> 28:36.880
And the top speed is 216.

28:45.720 --> 28:48.800
Of course,
the GT is not perfect.

28:48.840 --> 28:52.240
The steering wheel is ugly
and difficult to use,

28:52.280 --> 28:54.720
the fuel tank is too small,

28:54.760 --> 28:56.400
and the body is too big.

28:57.480 --> 28:59.880
And yet...

28:59.920 --> 29:04.520
Ferraris and Lamborghinis and
McLarens are very good cars,
make no mistake about that.

29:04.560 --> 29:07.600
But mostly
they're bought by posers.

29:07.640 --> 29:09.600
Now, this isn't for posing.

29:09.640 --> 29:13.760
It's too rough
and too plasticky
and too noisy for that.

29:13.800 --> 29:17.800
You buy one of these
so you can go to a track
on a miserable Monday morning

29:17.840 --> 29:21.840
when nobody's looking...
and do this.

29:27.280 --> 29:30.040
-Whoo!

29:31.800 --> 29:34.160
And you've got
to love it for that.

29:44.960 --> 29:49.600
Do you know...
the strange thing
about that car

29:49.640 --> 29:53.360
is that I finished
filming it, got into my car,
went home,

29:53.400 --> 29:56.760
and I haven't really given
the GT another thought since.

29:56.800 --> 29:59.480
I think it's something
to do with the fact
it's got that V6,

29:59.520 --> 30:02.240
because V6 engines
just aren't exciting.

30:02.280 --> 30:04.000
It's like they've got
no personality.

30:04.040 --> 30:06.480
Some are, but I'm with you
a lot of the time.

30:06.520 --> 30:09.560
He's right. If they're
turbocharged especially,
because then they don't rev.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.880
You want that extra bit of...

30:11.920 --> 30:15.440
It could be the interior,
which is made from that...
It feels like shiny plastic.

30:15.480 --> 30:18.440
It feels cheap and low-rent.
But whatever it is,

30:18.480 --> 30:21.960
it feels to me as though
it hasn't really got a soul.

30:22.000 --> 30:27.040
But we must now find out
how fast it goes around
the Eboladrome.

30:28.120 --> 30:29.600
Right, here we go.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.360
JEREMY: And she's off!
Spoiler up, suspension
dropped, in full track mode,

30:35.400 --> 30:40.240
as she makes a confident
start onto the Isn't.

30:40.280 --> 30:44.560
Knocking it down a gear
for the first curve to keep
those turbos spinning,

30:44.600 --> 30:48.760
and already looking
on the raggedy edge.

30:48.800 --> 30:53.360
She's really not mucking
about here, as she flies
into Your Name Here.

30:55.200 --> 30:58.240
Ooh! There's a howl from
the bespoke Michelins there.

30:58.280 --> 31:02.560
Now... Oh, yeah,
look at that smooth arc
around Your Name Here,

31:02.600 --> 31:08.360
and then lighting
the afterburners for the fast
run back down the Isn't.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.240
Not what you would call a
soulful sound, as we've said,

31:11.280 --> 31:15.080
but there's no doubting the
sheer speed of this thing.

31:15.120 --> 31:19.760
OK, into Old Lady's House.
Taking it steady
through there.

31:19.800 --> 31:22.080
Easy does it.

31:22.120 --> 31:27.400
And now back on the gas
for what will be a bumpy ride
down to Substation.

31:28.760 --> 31:31.800
Hard on the mighty
carbon brakes.

31:31.840 --> 31:35.520
Neat through there. This is a
Le-Mans-winning performance.

31:35.560 --> 31:39.000
Through Field of Sheep
and across the line!

31:39.040 --> 31:42.400
-That looked unbelievably
quick. Did you see it?

31:42.440 --> 31:43.960
RICHARD: Yeah, skittering.
-It was properly&

31:44.000 --> 31:47.160
She must have been
properly hanging on in there.

31:47.200 --> 31:51.560
Anyway, we must now find out
where it goes on the board.

31:51.600 --> 31:54.760
Let's have a look.
I imagine pretty high.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.440
RICHARD: Oh!

31:56.480 --> 31:57.680
JEREMY: Well, yes.

31:59.360 --> 32:01.360
One seventeen six.

32:01.400 --> 32:04.640
RICHARD: That's...
a second or so slower
than the Lamborghini,

32:04.680 --> 32:07.200
which is half the price,
remember.

32:07.240 --> 32:10.320
Yeah, but I think what that
shows is not that the Ford is
slow, because it just isn't -

32:10.360 --> 32:12.760
I mean, it's quicker
than a McLaren 720.

32:12.800 --> 32:16.520
What that shows actually
is just how fast
that Huracán is.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.400
No. Yes, exactly.
That's blistering.

32:18.440 --> 32:21.000
Absolutely blistering.
Unbelievable car, that.

32:21.040 --> 32:24.800
Anyway, it's now time
for Celebrity Face-Off.

32:37.840 --> 32:40.960
Yeah. And once again&

32:41.000 --> 32:44.720
Once again, we have a very
big question, and it is this:

32:44.760 --> 32:49.960
who is the fastest drummer
from a band beginning with
the letter "P"?

32:50.000 --> 32:53.680
To find out, would you please
welcome from The Police,
Stewart Copeland,

32:53.720 --> 32:56.200
and from Pink Floyd,
Nick Mason!

32:58.120 --> 32:59.640
JEREMY: Look at this!

33:01.520 --> 33:03.720
We are in the presence
of greatness.

33:04.920 --> 33:07.240
Gentlemen. Nick.

33:07.280 --> 33:09.280
-Have a seat, Stewart.
-Very nice to meet you.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.280
Holy cow! Look at that!

33:13.040 --> 33:16.120
We are not
messing around tonight.

33:16.160 --> 33:19.720
Genuine rock gods
have come among us.

33:19.760 --> 33:23.200
You are both regarded
as particularly excellent
drummers.

33:23.240 --> 33:24.960
Well, by each other, yeah.

33:27.040 --> 33:29.040
And one thing I see
that you have in common

33:29.080 --> 33:31.000
is your favourite drummer
is the same person.

33:31.040 --> 33:33.280
Yeah, Mitch Mitchell. We
worked this out last night.

33:33.320 --> 33:36.040
-We sorted out the hierarchy
last night.
-That's exactly right.

33:36.080 --> 33:39.840
And er...I knew
we were really on it,
because the table next door

33:39.880 --> 33:41.720
were beginning to eavesdrop,

33:41.760 --> 33:44.400
and after five minutes
they had both actually
gone to sleep.

33:44.440 --> 33:47.360
That's right. We lost them.
We had lost them
by the main course.

33:47.400 --> 33:50.040
So you both agree
that Mitch Mitchell
was your favourite drummer?

33:50.080 --> 33:52.320
Yeah, our favourite, I think.

33:52.360 --> 33:55.080
This was Jimi Hendrix's
drummer, I think we should
explain to those of you

33:55.120 --> 33:57.360
who are not as old as,
let's say, we are.

33:57.400 --> 33:58.840
Well, that's the travesty
right there.

33:58.880 --> 34:02.080
This great towering,
this monument of drums...

34:02.120 --> 34:03.920
"was Jimi Hendrix's drummer."

34:03.960 --> 34:05.440
Well, how would you
describe him?

34:05.480 --> 34:08.040
Well, Jimi was
Mitch's guitarist.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.640
-Nice. Good.
-Yeah.

34:10.680 --> 34:14.400
One thing that fascinates me
is why are drummers always
the butt of everybody's wit?

34:14.440 --> 34:16.680
Well, when I say "wit"
I mean jokes.

34:16.720 --> 34:20.440
It's because they secretly
admire our dragging knuckles.

34:20.480 --> 34:23.200
-They sense our power.

34:23.240 --> 34:25.360
But there are so many
good jokes, right?

34:25.400 --> 34:27.680
What does a drummer
get on an IQ test?

34:27.720 --> 34:29.600
BOTH: Drool.
JEREMY: Yeah,
drool, exactly.

34:29.640 --> 34:32.920
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What do you throw
a drowning guitarist?

34:32.960 --> 34:36.040
-His amp.

34:36.080 --> 34:39.840
How do you know it's the lead
guitarist at the front door?

34:39.880 --> 34:42.680
-Got the wrong key,
doesn't know when to come in.
STEWART: Yeah.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.920
-That's a good one.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.600
So we like
the guitarist jokes.

34:48.640 --> 34:51.760
Yeah, got any more jokes?

34:51.800 --> 34:54.960
By the way,
since we're the gnarliest
members of the band,

34:55.000 --> 34:58.200
for two hours
we chop wood for a living,

34:58.240 --> 35:00.840
and they're prissy
little fiddling
in front of this thing.

35:00.880 --> 35:03.680
And you're giving it...
Yes, it is.
It's hard work as well.

35:03.720 --> 35:05.760
They tell these jokes
and we just take it.

35:05.800 --> 35:07.520
-We do.
-Because that's
how great we are.

35:09.240 --> 35:11.200
You have a rule as well
if you make a mistake
with drumming,

35:11.240 --> 35:12.680
which I particularly enjoy.

35:12.720 --> 35:16.680
The suggestion is,
if you do make a mistake...

35:16.720 --> 35:18.320
look angrily
at the bass player.

35:20.400 --> 35:22.760
"What the hell
are you doing?"
Let's move on to gigs.

35:22.800 --> 35:25.640
You both presumably
played really big ones
over the years.

35:25.680 --> 35:27.920
What's been your biggest,
do you reckon?

35:27.960 --> 35:29.920
Well, we've been comparing
notes, but, you know,

35:29.960 --> 35:31.760
you played a stadium
and there are...

35:31.800 --> 35:35.000
-We sell out, so, you know...
-Yeah, a stadium's a stadium.

35:35.040 --> 35:38.160
But I think he's still
got me. We all played
the Stade de France.

35:38.200 --> 35:40.600
I played it twice - you know,
two nights running -

35:40.640 --> 35:42.960
he played it
three times running.

35:43.000 --> 35:47.120
OK, he beat me on this one,
then he beat me on that one,
because he came before me.

35:47.160 --> 35:49.000
This is the way musicians
establish the hierarchy.

35:49.040 --> 35:50.680
He's a drummer,
they always come first.

35:50.720 --> 35:53.560
You know,
Manfred Mann outranks me
because he came before,

35:53.600 --> 35:55.320
but Kanye is my bitch.

36:03.400 --> 36:05.960
-Now, I've got a question
here from Richard Hammond.
RICHARD: Oh, God.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.200
JEREMY: No, no.

36:08.240 --> 36:10.480
-Richard Hammond -
he's there, in the audience.
STEWART: There you are.

36:10.520 --> 36:12.560
-He's a big fan
of One Direction.
RICHARD: What?

36:12.600 --> 36:15.600
-And his question is, "How
do you old dinosaurs feel

36:15.640 --> 36:17.120
now that music's
got so good?"

36:17.160 --> 36:19.840
RICHARD: I didn't say that!

36:19.880 --> 36:21.840
I did not say that!

36:21.880 --> 36:25.080
-You did say that.
-I didn't say that!
Why would I say that?

36:25.120 --> 36:28.080
-I think I'll let Mr Mason
handle this one.
-Yeah.

36:28.120 --> 36:30.400
Well, I'd like to go
on record as saying

36:30.440 --> 36:34.640
that fairly recently erm...
I was on a show.

36:34.680 --> 36:37.320
I was promoting something -
probably double glazing -

36:37.360 --> 36:40.880
and I was with erm...
Harry Styles was on as well.

36:40.920 --> 36:43.200
And I did offer
to play drums for him,

36:43.240 --> 36:45.560
because I'm really
looking for work. I mean...

36:47.440 --> 36:49.040
We've got to get on to cars.
No, actually, we haven't.

36:49.080 --> 36:51.960
No, not yet, because
I want to talk about fathers.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.280
-Because your father was...
-..a wonderful man.

36:55.320 --> 36:57.960
-And a CIA spy.
-That, too.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.080
-In his spare time.
-In his spare time.

37:00.120 --> 37:02.920
He was a great father
and a jazz musician.
That's how I knew him.

37:02.960 --> 37:05.560
And he was uh...
Before the war
he played jazz,

37:05.600 --> 37:07.920
and I've still got
his trumpet -
he was a session player.

37:07.960 --> 37:11.880
Then the Great War broke out
and he joined the army
and got into intelligence,

37:11.920 --> 37:15.760
and he shaped the modern
Middle East as it was
up until 9/11.

37:15.800 --> 37:18.560
Everything
that happened after 9/11
is not my dad's fault.

37:18.600 --> 37:20.640
-No.

37:20.680 --> 37:23.800
I mean, he was very
instrumental in Nasser
in Egypt, wasn't he?

37:23.840 --> 37:27.760
Yeah, well, when I was born,
Daddy was away
on business in Cairo,

37:27.800 --> 37:31.360
installing Gamal Abdel Nasser
as the dictator of Egypt.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.440
Did you know
your dad was CIA?

37:33.480 --> 37:37.680
I didn't know
until I was in college
and um...his book came out.

37:37.720 --> 37:41.040
-And on the liner notes
of the book...

37:41.080 --> 37:43.760
OK, but when did he stop
being a spy?

37:43.800 --> 37:46.600
-I... Well...
-Well, certainly after
he'd written the book.

37:53.720 --> 37:56.880
And your father -
we can turn to that. Now,
he was a documentary maker.

37:56.920 --> 38:00.120
-Mm-hm.
-But mostly
a motor racing enthusiast.

38:00.160 --> 38:02.640
-Yeah.
-Which has rubbed off on you.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.520
Mm, just a bit.

38:04.560 --> 38:07.120
This is where I'm afraid
we have to tune you out
slightly, Stewart,

38:07.160 --> 38:10.280
for a little while, because
Nick's car collection is...

38:10.320 --> 38:12.640
-This is a car show.
-It is a car show.

38:12.680 --> 38:15.760
-Not a spy-daddy show.

38:15.800 --> 38:19.000
-I don't know. Erm...

38:20.440 --> 38:22.840
Hm. Twen--

38:22.880 --> 38:24.400
Thir--

38:24.440 --> 38:25.520
Thir

38:25.560 --> 38:26.880
Forty?

38:26.920 --> 38:29.120
I've got a list here
of some of them.

38:29.160 --> 38:32.080
We're not talking now
about, you know,
cars like a Ford Cortina,

38:32.120 --> 38:35.200
because you've got
an Alfa Romeo TZ1,

38:35.240 --> 38:39.000
Aston Martin Ulster,
1930 Bentley 4.5L,

38:39.040 --> 38:42.960
Bugatti Type 35,
Ferrari 250 GTO,

38:43.000 --> 38:47.880
Ferrari 250 LM,
Ferrari 512 Berlinetta Boxer,
Ferrari Daytona Competition,

38:47.920 --> 38:51.400
Ferrari F40,
Model T4, Jaguar D-Type,

38:51.440 --> 38:56.440
Maserati 250F, Maserati
Birdcage, McLaren GTR.

38:56.480 --> 38:59.920
It's a remarkable collection.
Which is your favourite?

38:59.960 --> 39:03.960
Er... It always has to be
the 250 GTO,

39:04.000 --> 39:06.240
because it makes me
look clever.

39:06.280 --> 39:08.560
You know, when I bought
this car 40 years ago...

39:08.600 --> 39:10.800
JEREMY: May I just ask -
it's a rude question,
I know -

39:10.840 --> 39:13.760
but how much did you pay
for the GTO?

39:13.800 --> 39:17.160
-I paid
about 35 grand for it.

39:17.200 --> 39:20.400
-I... Don't tell me.

39:20.440 --> 39:23.600
-Thirty million.

39:23.640 --> 39:25.680
No, more than that. Oh!

39:27.960 --> 39:31.600
-Oh, God. I've left them
on the meter.

39:31.640 --> 39:34.600
Have you got, like,
the garage from hell?

39:34.640 --> 39:38.560
And these are largely racing
cars. It's racing that
interests you more than...

39:38.600 --> 39:42.160
Yeah. I never wanted to be
a car collector, I wanted
to go motor racing.

39:42.200 --> 39:45.240
-And you do
actually use them?
-Yes.

39:45.280 --> 39:48.880
-Erm... Not often,
but occasionally, yeah.

39:48.920 --> 39:51.560
-Well, you lend them
to your family.
Yes.

39:51.600 --> 39:55.360
Who would like to see
a photograph of what your
daughter did to one?

39:55.400 --> 39:57.360
-There she is.

39:57.400 --> 39:59.760
-It's known as the Cupcake.

40:01.920 --> 40:05.440
The gloves and the helmet
and the... look go great
in the pink Cupcake.

40:05.480 --> 40:06.800
She's trying
to steer it still.

40:06.840 --> 40:08.560
NICK: On the side,
it all looks...

40:08.600 --> 40:10.760
She hasn't given up,
that's what I really...

40:10.800 --> 40:12.840
-"I can get this back."

40:12.880 --> 40:15.120
Right, come on,
then, Stewart,
let's get to your cars.

40:15.160 --> 40:18.400
It starts with a...
It's not quite as impressive
as Nick's, is it?

40:18.440 --> 40:20.400
-A Morris Traveller.
-There you go.

40:20.440 --> 40:22.600
I got it for 40 quid
from a gypsy,

40:22.640 --> 40:25.000
and I spent
most of the time under it.

40:25.040 --> 40:27.040
-That was when
you were in the UK?
-Yeah.

40:27.080 --> 40:30.360
-And I had a Millman Minx for
a very short amount of time?

40:30.400 --> 40:33.160
-A Hill... A Millman Hinx.

40:33.200 --> 40:35.000
It met its end
in Hammersmith.

40:35.040 --> 40:36.320
No! How?

40:36.360 --> 40:38.040
Well, I was pulling around
Hammersmith,

40:38.080 --> 40:41.240
and an articulated lorry
came in front of me,

40:41.280 --> 40:43.800
and uh...so I slowed down,

40:43.840 --> 40:49.200
and the back of a truck
ran over and squashed
my Hillman Minx like a bug.

40:49.240 --> 40:51.120
On... Right there
in Hammersmith.

40:51.160 --> 40:54.360
And as I'm looking
at the smouldering remains
of my car,

40:54.400 --> 40:57.200
a cop comes up and gave me
a ticket for bald tyres.

41:00.240 --> 41:04.000
That's cruel.
Anyway, look, we've got
to get on to your laps.

41:04.040 --> 41:06.720
Er... Now, whose lap
shall we see first?
Let me think.

41:06.760 --> 41:09.000
I think
we should start with...

41:09.040 --> 41:11.360
Well, let's be honest,
let's start with
the older gentleman,

41:11.400 --> 41:13.200
the elder statesman, the pro.

41:13.240 --> 41:16.000
-OK, who would like to see
Nick's lap?

41:16.040 --> 41:17.760
Come on, then.
Let's have a look.

41:21.720 --> 41:23.160
STEWART:
That's how you do it.

41:23.200 --> 41:25.080
OK, launch control.

41:25.120 --> 41:29.800
JEREMY: And... Oh,
look at that for a tidy line.

41:29.840 --> 41:32.920
This is a man
who's done racing before.

41:32.960 --> 41:35.840
Holding it nicely there.

41:35.880 --> 41:38.760
-And onto the gravel.
STEWART: Very nice.
Very nice. Look at that.

41:38.800 --> 41:41.040
JEREMY: No brake lights.

41:41.080 --> 41:43.760
Oh, but there should
have been, perhaps,
because that's quite wide.

41:43.800 --> 41:48.440
And there we are.
So, quick at the beginning,
slow now - typical drummer.

41:48.480 --> 41:51.600
drift!

41:51.640 --> 41:54.400
JEREMY: Oh, look at...
That's nicely done, Nick.
STEWART: Nice, nice.

41:55.880 --> 41:57.880
JEREMY:
And into Difficult Bit Two.

41:57.920 --> 42:02.000
-You're just kissing
those lines so neatly.
-That bodes well.

42:02.040 --> 42:04.960
JEREMY: No, it does.
You know, it doesn't look
particularly fast,

42:05.000 --> 42:08.760
but I can just see...
Let's have a look. That's
really skinny, that bit.

42:08.800 --> 42:11.080
STEWART: The gravel's insane.

42:11.120 --> 42:13.120
JEREMY: Yeah,
but it's when you get back
on the tarmac, you think...

42:13.160 --> 42:16.680
Oh, that was wide!
Right, now into the fast bit.

42:16.720 --> 42:20.360
-Whoa! Scary!

42:20.400 --> 42:23.200
JEREMY: Yeah,
it is that fast. It is quite
scary through here.

42:24.600 --> 42:26.560
That is tidily done.
Did you lift?

42:29.120 --> 42:31.600
STEWART: Wahoo!

42:31.640 --> 42:34.360
JEREMY: And there we are,
he is across the line. So
that's good - you're there.

42:34.400 --> 42:36.320
Did you lift off
on the fast bit?

42:36.360 --> 42:38.360
By the end of it
I did it flat.

42:38.400 --> 42:40.560
You did it flat?

42:40.600 --> 42:43.680
OK, then. Who would like
to see Stewart's lap?

42:43.720 --> 42:46.160
-Let's have a look
at Stewart's lap.

42:49.800 --> 42:51.000
JEREMY: Yeah, tidy start.

42:51.040 --> 42:54.960
-Hallelujah! Geronimo!

42:55.000 --> 42:57.640
JEREMY:
Are we as tidy as Nick?
No, we're just cheating.

42:57.680 --> 43:00.640
STEWART: Off the course.
JEREMY: No, that was nice.
I like to slow it...

43:00.680 --> 43:03.960
Yes, that's good.
Keep it on the right,
ready for the left,

43:04.000 --> 43:07.640
and onto the difficult bit,
when it starts to just snake
around on you.

43:07.680 --> 43:11.560
STEWART: This is insane.
This gravel is just
completely insane.

43:11.600 --> 43:14.200
JEREMY: No, I can tell you're
really enjoying the gravel.

43:14.240 --> 43:17.200
-I hate the dirt!
The dirt sucks!

43:17.240 --> 43:21.160
JEREMY: No, I may have got
that wrong. But this bit...
Yes, nicely done.

43:21.200 --> 43:24.000
You're a lot more violent,
I'd say, than Nick here.

43:24.040 --> 43:27.080
A lot more... Yeah, look at
that - kicking the tail out.

43:27.120 --> 43:29.120
-Some upthrust there.
-Kicking the tail out again.

43:29.160 --> 43:31.080
JEREMY: Soon you'll be
back on the tarmac.

43:31.120 --> 43:34.720
STEWART: A bit of a weave
there, it must be said.

43:34.760 --> 43:37.400
JEREMY: I approve of the...
STEWART: It's looking
really dramatic.

43:37.440 --> 43:41.600
JEREMY: It is dramatic. It's
a lot more dramatic-looking
than Nick's lap, but...

43:41.640 --> 43:44.040
-Let's go!

43:44.080 --> 43:46.640
JEREMY: This is a man
on a mission. Oh, Christ!

43:46.680 --> 43:50.200
That is quick through there,
I'm gonna be honest,
and nicely held.

43:50.240 --> 43:52.880
STEWART: Stay on course here.
OK, this is the big turn.

43:52.920 --> 43:56.360
JEREMY: And you've made it.
He's made it back,
all the way across the line!

44:03.440 --> 44:05.440
Who shall we do first?

44:05.480 --> 44:09.680
I think we're gonna go
with Steady Eddie here,
Nick Mason.

44:09.720 --> 44:12.120
-One twenty-one three.
Oh.

44:12.160 --> 44:15.120
Well, you're pulling a face
but you don't know what
anyone else did.

44:15.160 --> 44:17.400
There you are at 1:21.3.

44:17.440 --> 44:20.760
Just to give you an idea,
that puts you at exactly the
same time as Luke Evans,

44:20.800 --> 44:22.440
who's in The Fast
And The Furious.

44:22.480 --> 44:24.240
Quicker than Hugh Bonneville,
quicker than Michael Ball,

44:24.280 --> 44:26.360
quicker than
David Hasselhoff.

44:26.400 --> 44:29.080
-Whoa! That's some shit.
-Stewart Copeland.

44:30.920 --> 44:33.200
-You looked faster.
-Felt faster.

44:33.240 --> 44:35.160
Felt faster.

44:35.200 --> 44:38.240
But you did it in 1:24.2

44:38.280 --> 44:40.200
-So...

44:43.640 --> 44:46.840
Hey... I made it
around the course.

44:46.880 --> 44:49.160
-You made it around
the course...
-Mostly.

44:49.200 --> 44:52.520
-..but I don't think
we've had anyone slower.

44:52.560 --> 44:57.480
-No, I'm lying. Bill Bailey,
a well-known comedian here--
-Yes, Bill! You my bitch!

44:59.600 --> 45:01.760
-Bill Bailey and Alfie Boe,
they're both slower.
-Two bitches!

45:01.800 --> 45:04.280
You've got two
British bitches.

45:04.320 --> 45:07.760
So, there we are, ladies and
gentlemen. Thank you so much,
Stewart Copeland,

45:07.800 --> 45:12.280
and the fastest drummer
from a band beginning
with "P", Nick Mason!

45:22.240 --> 45:27.040
Now, tonight Hammond and
Clarkson are driving around
France in some rubbish,

45:27.080 --> 45:30.080
and I've turned up in a
modern Honda Civic Type R

45:30.120 --> 45:33.320
to prove that modern cars
are more reliable,
more comfortable,

45:33.360 --> 45:35.800
and, in fact,
better in every single way.

45:35.840 --> 45:40.360
Yeah, whatever. When we left
the action, I was standing
outside our overnight hotel,

45:40.400 --> 45:43.960
trying to work out how
to secure a £1 million Jaguar

45:44.000 --> 45:46.920
that has no roof
or door locks.

45:46.960 --> 45:50.240
It was a problem.
We pick up the action
the following morning.

46:03.000 --> 46:06.120
JAMES : Morning.
-Morning.

46:06.160 --> 46:08.200
-No.

46:15.880 --> 46:19.080
-Yeah, I got bored.

46:19.120 --> 46:20.920
JEREMY: I'm amazed
he didn't notice.

46:20.960 --> 46:23.200
RICHARD: It could have
something to do with the fact

46:23.240 --> 46:26.720
that nobody ever looks
at their number plate
before they drive off.

46:28.200 --> 46:30.920
-Good point.

46:34.280 --> 46:36.840
JAMES: Soon, they had got
their stupid cars going

46:36.880 --> 46:41.760
and we were on our way
to the mountains.

46:41.800 --> 46:44.440
While I was asleep
in my luxurious hotel bed
last night,

46:44.480 --> 46:46.360
I came up with
a bit of a plan.

46:48.200 --> 46:50.160
We'd head over the Pyrenees,

46:50.200 --> 46:53.400
into Spain
and down to Barcelona,

46:53.440 --> 46:57.440
to try our cars
on a very special track
that I'd heard about.

46:59.000 --> 47:01.360
On the way I'd prove
my car was better,

47:01.400 --> 47:04.920
and at the circuit
I'd prove that even
with me at the helm,

47:04.960 --> 47:08.360
it's faster as well.

47:08.400 --> 47:11.640
Here's what you need to know
about old cars -

47:11.680 --> 47:16.880
they are great to look at,
but you don't want
to drive one

47:16.920 --> 47:21.080
any more than you want to use
an old twin-tub
washing machine.

47:21.120 --> 47:23.680
They're just crap.

47:23.720 --> 47:26.600
JEREMY: I honestly don't know
what James May's on about.

47:26.640 --> 47:28.960
"I don't like old stuff."
He loves it!

47:29.000 --> 47:33.880
He can't get enough of it!
He owns a 1977 Ferrari.

47:33.920 --> 47:38.280
He has a collection of
ancient Honda motorcycles.

47:38.320 --> 47:43.760
Does he spend his spare time
fixing computers
or going to raves? No.

47:43.800 --> 47:46.440
He spends it
eating old-fashioned pies

47:46.480 --> 47:49.600
and helping his friends
rebuild a steam engine.

47:49.640 --> 47:52.920
I know some of you think
I'm being deliberately obtuse

47:52.960 --> 47:54.520
driving this Honda,
but I'm not.

47:54.560 --> 47:57.440
I promise you,
I do genuinely like it.

48:01.280 --> 48:06.160
Not only does it hold the lap
record for front-wheel drive
cars around the Nurburgring -

48:06.200 --> 48:08.800
seven seconds faster
than the old one -

48:08.840 --> 48:11.240
it's done that while
becoming more refined.

48:11.280 --> 48:14.040
The engine's smoother,
the ride's more subtle.

48:14.080 --> 48:18.640
It's just a bit better
all-round. It's tremendous.

48:18.680 --> 48:24.720
It's also very easy to drive,
which old cars are not.

48:32.160 --> 48:34.360
It's in.

48:34.400 --> 48:37.920
JEREMY: Annoyingly, at slow
speeds, James had a point.

48:37.960 --> 48:41.600
The Aston
was a tricky little sod.

48:41.640 --> 48:46.360
-That gearbox whine,
it's quite pronounced.

48:48.720 --> 48:51.680
And then there was
the change action.

48:57.760 --> 49:04.280
On balance, I think I prefer
a double-clutch system...
with paddles.

49:04.320 --> 49:08.120
I'm just trying to do up my
shirtsleeves, because it's
quite chilly

49:08.160 --> 49:09.960
and that will make
a difference.

49:11.720 --> 49:13.520
Definitely getting colder.

49:13.560 --> 49:19.680
Fortunately,
the 3.4L straight-six
generates so much heat,

49:19.720 --> 49:24.000
and there is so little
shielding, that whilst
my top half is cold,

49:24.040 --> 49:26.240
my bottom half
is toasty warm.

49:27.320 --> 49:29.800
Window doesn't wind down,

49:29.840 --> 49:33.040
no vents,
no air conditioning.

49:33.080 --> 49:36.440
No air in here at all,
in fact. Just heat.

49:37.960 --> 49:40.120
What I'm being is casseroled.

49:42.080 --> 49:44.360
JEREMY:
And soon things got worse...

49:45.520 --> 49:47.680
I'm trying not to shiver.

49:47.720 --> 49:50.280
JEREMY: ..because
a thick fog descended.

49:52.080 --> 49:55.080
This meant we had
to slow down even more.

49:57.200 --> 50:00.640
And that made
the Aston even worse.

50:11.960 --> 50:15.480
This is very authentically
'50s. I'm enjoying it.

50:15.520 --> 50:19.120
JEREMY : It's
sometimes quite difficult
to get it into gear.

50:19.160 --> 50:22.000
JAMES : I'm just
going to try that in my car.
Hold on.

50:22.040 --> 50:24.880
Let's have second gear. Hm.

50:24.920 --> 50:27.080
I can even knock it down
to first here.

50:28.560 --> 50:30.960
Second. No, it works.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.480
No, mine's a piece of cake.

50:33.520 --> 50:37.120
But there's no sense
of satisfaction, is there,
when you do it right?

50:37.160 --> 50:40.080
Yeah, there is.

50:40.120 --> 50:44.640
JEREMY: After a little while,
the fog went from thick
to impenetrable.

50:47.080 --> 50:50.960
RICHARD: I can see
pretty much nothing now.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.040
The lights don't help
and the windscreen wipers

50:53.080 --> 50:56.600
just move the water around
on the windscreen.

50:58.120 --> 51:00.560
Literally can't see
a thing now.

51:00.600 --> 51:04.760
Fog, rain, noise.

51:04.800 --> 51:06.160
A lot of noise.

51:08.320 --> 51:09.840
RICHARD:
Yeah, I'm quite cold now.

51:12.640 --> 51:17.360
However,
the impending hypothermia
was not my main worry.

51:17.400 --> 51:19.480
-Oh, my God.

51:19.520 --> 51:22.680
It's not sounding...
Yeah, it's not good.

51:22.720 --> 51:26.520
I'm having to slip the clutch
to sort of keep it
moving at all.

51:28.440 --> 51:30.960
Yeah, I think I'm down
to three cylinders now.

51:32.720 --> 51:37.600
And then I had
a good old 1950s breakdown.

51:40.720 --> 51:42.720
What's the matter with it?

51:42.760 --> 51:46.760
I think it's the spark plugs
are all fouled up
and gummed up.

51:46.800 --> 51:48.840
-Well, don't tell James.

51:48.880 --> 51:51.720
No. Well, where is he?

51:51.760 --> 51:54.840
I don't even know
where my car is and I only
parked it over there.

51:54.880 --> 51:56.520
I can't see a damn thing.

51:56.560 --> 51:58.600
No. Well, at least he won't
have seen me doing this.

51:58.640 --> 52:01.920
-He could drive by.
-Well... I'll...

52:01.960 --> 52:03.720
You go ahead.

52:03.760 --> 52:06.240
Look, tell him I'm behind
him, or I'm ahead somewhere.

52:06.280 --> 52:08.680
-I could be 100 yards away.
-I'll get back on the road.

52:08.720 --> 52:11.120
-You get on the road.
I'll fix this.
-He'll never know.

52:11.160 --> 52:13.400
Exactly. Tell him I'm
having a lovely time and--

52:13.440 --> 52:16.520
-It's starting to rain,
though, Hammond.
-Yes, I know!

52:16.560 --> 52:18.280
-No!

52:21.200 --> 52:24.480
JEREMY: Where's
my bloody car? Has anyone...

52:24.520 --> 52:27.200
Can anyone see
an Aston Martin anywhere?

52:29.040 --> 52:30.400
Hello?

52:31.520 --> 52:33.800
Hammond?

52:33.840 --> 52:38.040
I've found a car here.
It's... Oh, it's...
It's a Toyota.

52:39.280 --> 52:41.000
And th-they're dogging.

52:42.920 --> 52:45.400
They really are, actually.
That's quite embarrassing.

52:49.320 --> 52:52.560
Yeah, they're driving away
now because they realise.

52:55.440 --> 52:57.040
Hello. Sorry about...

53:08.560 --> 53:10.240
Nothing to see here.

53:12.600 --> 53:15.640
Leaving Hammond to his
repairs on Dogger Bank,

53:15.680 --> 53:20.280
I made some changes in my car
and set off to find James.

53:23.080 --> 53:24.520
Oh, yes!

53:25.600 --> 53:29.200
I have improved
my Aston Martin.

53:29.240 --> 53:32.800
All of a sudden,
my car makes sense -

53:32.840 --> 53:35.640
I can't hear it.

53:35.680 --> 53:41.080
And then I came across
ASBO Man, who was
immediately suspicious.

53:41.120 --> 53:42.520
JAMES :
Where's Hammond?

53:42.560 --> 53:45.120
JEREMY:
Yeah, he's in front of me.

53:45.160 --> 53:47.720
I'm driving right behind.
I can see him, plain as day.

53:50.520 --> 53:53.120
JAMES: The fog is lifting
and I can't help noticing
that Richard Hammond,

53:53.160 --> 53:54.960
who is supposedly
in front of you,

53:55.000 --> 53:58.080
is driving a Land Rover
Discovery filming car.

53:59.160 --> 54:01.560
No, no.
He er... He overtook it.

54:01.600 --> 54:05.560
Er... He roared off.
Unbelievable speed.
I couldn't keep up.

54:05.600 --> 54:07.840
-No.

54:10.200 --> 54:12.160
JAMES :
Are your brakes squeaking?

54:12.200 --> 54:14.520
JEREMY :
No, they're birds.
It's birdsong.

54:14.560 --> 54:18.360
Right, James, look out.
There are cows,
followed by Hitler.

54:21.200 --> 54:23.240
Oh, no, it's not Hitler,
it's Winston Churchill.

54:29.200 --> 54:31.920
JEREMY : A cow has
attacked the Aston Martin!

54:35.200 --> 54:39.440
Don't do that!
Go and attack the Honda.

54:39.480 --> 54:44.880
RICHARD: Meanwhile, I'd
got my car going again, and
was starting to regret it.

54:44.920 --> 54:48.600
Yeah, this is quite hard work
now. I'll be honest,
I'm getting pretty tired.

54:48.640 --> 54:52.080
My... My left leg is agony.

54:52.120 --> 54:53.200
Gear change.

54:55.600 --> 54:56.920
My knee hurts.

54:58.320 --> 55:01.400
So do my ears, actually.
I'm also quite cold.

55:03.840 --> 55:06.800
JEREMY: The truth is that
in the fog, at slow speeds,

55:06.840 --> 55:08.880
on James's ridiculous route,

55:08.920 --> 55:12.160
which was full of wartime
leaders and attack cows,

55:12.200 --> 55:15.880
the older cars here
had been hard work.

55:17.760 --> 55:21.920
But as we crested
the Pyrenees, the fog lifted.

55:27.200 --> 55:31.680
This meant I could drive
the Aston at the only speed
it understands.

55:33.480 --> 55:34.840
Flat out.

55:40.480 --> 55:43.800
Providing, of course,
I could get past James May.

55:48.480 --> 55:50.400
-I'm going into R mode.

55:50.440 --> 55:53.600
The lights on the instruments
have gone red.

55:53.640 --> 55:55.600
Goodbye, Mr Clarkson.

56:00.480 --> 56:01.680
He's going down!

56:04.120 --> 56:07.440
Oh, he's going down so badly!

56:07.480 --> 56:10.720
I'm all over
the back of him now.

56:10.760 --> 56:13.880
I have more power
and less weight.

56:17.320 --> 56:19.680
He can come snouting around
with his massive engine,

56:19.720 --> 56:22.600
but as soon as we get
to the curves I'll pull away.

56:24.080 --> 56:25.440
Coming through.

56:28.120 --> 56:29.640
JEREMY: Ha-ha!

56:33.240 --> 56:38.600
I was back in front,
and more importantly...
back in love with my Aston.

56:40.480 --> 56:42.600
What a car this is.

56:42.640 --> 56:45.840
Oh! You have to drive it.

56:45.880 --> 56:48.840
Every gear change
has to be... worked out.

56:48.880 --> 56:54.120
Every steering movement
thought through.

56:54.160 --> 56:57.960
And you can never get to the
corner and think, "I won't
bother heel-and-toeing here."

56:58.000 --> 57:00.960
You have to,
or it won't go into gear.

57:05.680 --> 57:10.120
JAMES: As we entered Spain,
we were back as a three.

57:10.160 --> 57:16.120
And soon
we reached Barcelona -
a city known for many things:

57:16.160 --> 57:19.440
its cathedral, its cafés,

57:19.480 --> 57:21.600
and its interesting
architecture.

57:21.640 --> 57:26.080
But, actually,
the most impressive
thing here is this.

57:30.320 --> 57:32.400
It's called the Terramar,

57:32.440 --> 57:35.960
and it's the oldest surviving
banked track in Europe.

57:37.640 --> 57:41.600
It opened in 1923,
staged one big race,

57:41.640 --> 57:45.840
and due to some unpaid bills,
closed a day later.

57:45.880 --> 57:49.680
For the last 50 years
it's been a chicken farm.

57:53.440 --> 57:59.400
OK, congratulations, James.
This is the steepest banked
circuit I've ever, ever seen.

57:59.440 --> 58:01.720
And I'm not even
at the steep bit of it yet.

58:01.760 --> 58:04.680
-Seventy-eight degrees
at the top, apparently.

58:04.720 --> 58:06.960
What's your plan, May?

58:07.000 --> 58:10.520
Well, what I thought we'd do
is put a speed trap
at the end of this curve,

58:10.560 --> 58:13.280
where it goes level again,
and whoever achieves
the highest speed

58:13.320 --> 58:15.080
through this banking
is the winner.

58:15.120 --> 58:18.240
Right. Erm... Can we have
a bit of practice first?

58:18.280 --> 58:21.120
Could I make a couple of
modifications to my Aston?

58:21.160 --> 58:23.120
Not if it's swapping it
for a DB11.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.240
I can't... I literally can't
get any higher than this.

58:27.280 --> 58:30.360
Have we got to drive
up there? We do,
don't we, to go fastest?

58:30.400 --> 58:32.320
JAMES: If you go
off the edge...
JEREMY: Yeah?

58:32.360 --> 58:34.360
...it's oblivion.

58:34.400 --> 58:36.960
-No, because the tree
will stop us, won't it?
RICHARD: No.

58:39.320 --> 58:41.400
JEREMY: Before we embarked
on our practice laps,

58:41.440 --> 58:44.600
I set about
my important modifications.

58:46.600 --> 58:48.440
What are you doing?

58:48.480 --> 58:51.040
I'm giving my car
air conditioning.

58:51.080 --> 58:54.120
You're drilling holes in a
one-and-a-half-million-pound
car?

58:57.560 --> 58:59.400
I couldn't do that.

58:59.440 --> 59:01.600
That's the difference between
you and me - I'm practical.

59:01.640 --> 59:03.840
-No, that's vandalism.
-It's not vandalism!

59:03.880 --> 59:05.800
It's got a hole in it!

59:05.840 --> 59:08.680
But now I'll be able
to breathe and see
where I'm going,

59:08.720 --> 59:11.720
which is important when
the track is at that angle.

59:11.760 --> 59:13.680
That's like saying,
"Westminster Abbey's
in the way.

59:13.720 --> 59:16.360
I'll knock it down
so I get a better view."
It's still vandalism.

59:16.400 --> 59:19.640
You don't like old things, so
why wouldn't you knock
Westminster Abbey down?

59:19.680 --> 59:24.080
-I like Westminster Abbey.
-Ha! Hoist by his own petard.
Another one here.

59:27.360 --> 59:30.800
JEREMY: With the air con
sorted, it was time
to start practising,

59:30.840 --> 59:36.120
on what, over the years,
has become a bumpy,
potholed deathtrap.

59:40.560 --> 59:43.440
Sixty miles an hour
as I approach...

59:43.480 --> 59:45.960
Whoa! Big pothole there.

59:46.000 --> 59:47.560
..the first corner.

59:49.320 --> 59:52.080
Already, I can tell
it's very bumpy.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.160
Whoa!
Steering's gone very weird!

1:00:01.960 --> 1:00:05.320
Christ! It's alarming.

1:00:05.360 --> 1:00:09.200
It's bloody ridiculous!
To look where you're going,
you have to look up.

1:00:09.240 --> 1:00:11.560
That doesn't happen in cars.
It's wrong!

1:00:15.680 --> 1:00:17.800
JEREMY: Coming up
to the second banked turn.

1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:23.600
-Christ!

1:00:25.160 --> 1:00:27.560
The bumps are so unnerving!

1:00:28.880 --> 1:00:30.360
Jesus!

1:00:30.400 --> 1:00:33.160
Apparently, some of them
are so violent

1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:37.800
they can make the car jump...
four feet to the right.

1:00:39.920 --> 1:00:45.440
The forces being exerted
on the outside tyres
are unbelievable.

1:00:45.480 --> 1:00:47.640
We are talking
planetary energy.

1:00:50.280 --> 1:00:55.000
Aware of this,
Hammond was starting
to make squeaky noises.

1:01:00.680 --> 1:01:04.600
Who said
I want to go up there?
Why would I go up there?

1:01:07.040 --> 1:01:10.040
I'm gonna try and lift it
up the banking on this one.
Here we go.

1:01:15.520 --> 1:01:17.400
Oh, shit!
That was a big bump!

1:01:22.360 --> 1:01:23.760
God Al-bloody-mighty!

1:01:26.800 --> 1:01:30.440
Jesus Christ!
That's terrible!

1:01:30.480 --> 1:01:33.720
JEREMY: Finally,
the practice laps were over.

1:01:33.760 --> 1:01:38.000
Oh, Christ!
This... is  scary.

1:01:38.040 --> 1:01:42.200
The problem with going around
a banked turn is there's
nothing you can do.

1:01:42.240 --> 1:01:44.160
You can't slow down,
you can't speed up.

1:01:44.200 --> 1:01:47.120
If anything goes wrong,
you're a passenger.

1:01:48.600 --> 1:01:51.520
And because he was
aware of that, too,

1:01:51.560 --> 1:01:54.800
Squeaky Boy decided he
didn't want to play any more.

1:01:54.840 --> 1:02:01.120
Yeah, well, my practice laps
have told me one thing -
I don't want to do it.

1:02:01.160 --> 1:02:05.680
I've just gone right off huge
motoring accidents at
the moment. Right off them.

1:02:07.680 --> 1:02:10.280
JEREMY: Having decided he
didn't want to buy the farm,

1:02:10.320 --> 1:02:13.800
he went off to buy
a farmhouse instead.

1:02:13.840 --> 1:02:16.120
So it became
a two-car shoot-out,

1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:18.600
and ASBO Man
was the first to go.

1:02:25.120 --> 1:02:26.720
Concentrate, May.
Concentrate.

1:02:27.880 --> 1:02:29.160
Give it some beanage.

1:02:39.920 --> 1:02:41.800
Shit! That's terrifying!

1:02:56.720 --> 1:03:01.280
-Bumpy! Bumpy!

1:03:01.320 --> 1:03:02.880
It's made the windscreen
wipers come on!

1:03:17.400 --> 1:03:22.000
Jeez! That is not a pleasant
sensation, I promise you.

1:03:30.920 --> 1:03:32.800
JEREMY: Right, this is it!

1:03:32.840 --> 1:03:35.120
Let's see how fast
I can make this thing go.

1:04:06.040 --> 1:04:08.560
Oh, my giddy aunt!
That is... Jesus Christ!

1:04:16.960 --> 1:04:18.720
That's bumpy shit!

1:04:21.080 --> 1:04:23.840
Oh,  me!

1:04:36.040 --> 1:04:38.800
That's one of
the scariest things
I've ever done in a car.

1:04:40.760 --> 1:04:41.880
Ever.

1:04:43.960 --> 1:04:45.760
JAMES: It was.

1:04:45.800 --> 1:04:49.520
Well done.
Well done. Well done.

1:04:49.560 --> 1:04:52.800
I've got to say erm...

1:04:52.840 --> 1:04:56.160
..we weren't joking there -
he really did
go and buy a farmhouse

1:04:56.200 --> 1:04:57.800
in south-west France.

1:04:57.840 --> 1:04:59.920
And actually, James and I
wish we'd gone with him,

1:04:59.960 --> 1:05:03.080
because that was
hideously terrifying.

1:05:03.120 --> 1:05:04.840
-It's awful.
-It really was.

1:05:04.880 --> 1:05:08.120
Anyway, I have the numbers
from the speed trap here,

1:05:08.160 --> 1:05:13.280
and, Jeremy Clarkson,
you passed it at 89mph.

1:05:13.320 --> 1:05:16.760
-Well done.
-That is brave.
That is brave.

1:05:16.800 --> 1:05:18.920
-Yes. Well done.

1:05:21.520 --> 1:05:25.800
-And then, James May,
you passed it at...
-Thirty-two.

1:05:25.840 --> 1:05:27.720
...93mph!

1:05:27.760 --> 1:05:29.800
-Oh!

1:05:29.840 --> 1:05:32.640
James May has won a thing!

1:05:32.680 --> 1:05:34.960
-I'm staggered! He has!
-He's won a thing!

1:05:37.600 --> 1:05:41.160
And what you've proved is,
by being so speedy,

1:05:41.200 --> 1:05:45.920
that modern cars
are 4mph faster
than they were 60 years ago.

1:05:45.960 --> 1:05:47.840
-Yeah.

1:05:47.880 --> 1:05:50.440
The thing is, though,
you can't actually drive
your cars on the road.

1:05:50.480 --> 1:05:53.720
Well, no, the Aston,
I have to admit, at slow
speed, is very difficult.

1:05:53.760 --> 1:05:56.680
If you try
and tickle it into gear,
it just won't have it.

1:05:56.720 --> 1:05:59.280
The only language
it understands is violence.

1:05:59.320 --> 1:06:00.960
You ram it in,
and then you're fine.

1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:03.120
That's not what
I was talking about.

1:06:03.160 --> 1:06:05.880
You're not actually allowed
to drive your cars
on the road, are you?

1:06:05.920 --> 1:06:10.280
I did, because Aston
registered that one
as a prototype, so I could.

1:06:10.320 --> 1:06:12.800
Yeah, it was a bit more
complicated in the Jag,

1:06:12.840 --> 1:06:14.760
because it was registered
as a test car,

1:06:14.800 --> 1:06:18.240
so technically only a Jaguar
employee can drive it.

1:06:18.280 --> 1:06:20.960
-I had to get a job
at Jaguar.

1:06:22.760 --> 1:06:25.480
Yeah, I-I now work
for Jaguar. I do.

1:06:25.520 --> 1:06:29.440
But as my job is now done,
Jaguar, I'm afraid I resign.

1:06:31.640 --> 1:06:35.000
How will the news go down
in Wall Street
when they hear about this?

1:06:35.040 --> 1:06:38.880
It will affect the share
price. "Hammond rocks City
with shock Jag move."

1:06:38.920 --> 1:06:40.520
-That could be the headline.

1:06:40.560 --> 1:06:42.800
Or it could be,
"Hamster screws big cat."

1:06:42.840 --> 1:06:45.600
-That would do it.
That would cover it.

1:06:45.640 --> 1:06:49.360
-Look, here is the...
here is the truth of it.
JEREMY: Yeah?

1:06:49.400 --> 1:06:51.840
If you went out and bought
one of those cars,

1:06:51.880 --> 1:06:56.040
you wouldn't legally
be allowed to drive it
on the road, would you?

1:06:56.080 --> 1:06:58.120
No, you wouldn't.

1:06:58.160 --> 1:07:00.840
So you've actually wasted
everybody's time,
haven't you?

1:07:00.880 --> 1:07:02.640
-A bit, yeah,
-Yeah, a bit.

1:07:02.680 --> 1:07:05.080
And on that terrible
disappointment,
it is time to end.

1:07:05.120 --> 1:07:07.840
Thank you so much
for watching.
See you next time. Goodbye!
