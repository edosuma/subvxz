WEBVTT

00:01.186 --> 00:02.928
One, two, three, four.

00:02.963 --> 00:05.351
I declare thumb war.

00:05.386 --> 00:08.227
Come on, lefty!
Grab his hang nail.

00:08.261 --> 00:10.788
Grab his hang nail.

00:11.322 --> 00:13.262
Cheater.

00:13.296 --> 00:14.736
Alex!

00:14.771 --> 00:18.417
I hope you unloaded the
dishwasher like I told you to.

00:18.452 --> 00:21.728
Shoot. I did!

00:36.986 --> 00:40.452
Alex, you know how I feel about
you using magic in the house!

00:40.486 --> 00:43.588
Mom, you know how I feel
about the dishwasher.

00:43.622 --> 00:45.589
When we need a dish,
we could just take it out.

00:45.624 --> 00:47.791
And then when we're
done, put it back in.

00:47.825 --> 00:50.659
And how would we know which ones
are clean and which ones are dirty?

00:50.694 --> 00:53.662
You smell them.

00:53.696 --> 00:56.464
Like your father
does with his shirts?

00:56.498 --> 00:58.199
You two are disgusting.

01:00.602 --> 01:02.370
This is going to be
the best Halloween yet.

01:02.405 --> 01:04.373
I've got a great idea
for our haunted house.

01:04.908 --> 01:07.077
Stop calling it a
haunted house.

01:07.111 --> 01:08.710
It's not even scary.

01:08.745 --> 01:11.177
You just do stupid skits
about making bad choices.

01:11.212 --> 01:13.846
Okay. An amusement attraction
that teaches people lessons

01:13.881 --> 01:17.283
about the gravity of life's
decisions isn't stupid.

01:17.317 --> 01:20.686
Justin, you're a wizard. You could make
the scariest haunted house of all time.

01:20.721 --> 01:22.621
Exactly! That's why
this year's theme is.

01:22.655 --> 01:25.790
"Peer Pressure: When Good
People Make Bad Choices."

01:26.324 --> 01:29.927
So I got a whole room where people are
playing video games instead of doing homework.

01:29.961 --> 01:31.595
Then you get
pressured into playing.

01:31.629 --> 01:33.897
Then we quickly act out
how your life is gonna go.

01:33.931 --> 01:37.834
Video games. No homework.
Flunk out. Beach hobo.

01:39.236 --> 01:41.803
Oh, I do love the beach!

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000

02:36.754 --> 02:38.321
- Okay Dad, are you ready?
- Yes.

02:38.356 --> 02:40.223
Now remember, you're
an eight year-old boy

02:40.257 --> 02:43.059
and it's your first time in the
Worst-Case-Scenario Scare House.

02:43.093 --> 02:45.060
Here's a balloon to help
you stay in character.

02:45.095 --> 02:47.395
Oh, can I have
a red one?

02:47.930 --> 02:50.932
You're an eight year-old boy,
you take what you get. Now, go!

02:50.966 --> 02:52.733
- But...
- Take it!

02:56.271 --> 03:00.140
Okay. I see by the clock
that it's past my bedtime,

03:00.174 --> 03:03.109
- and I haven't done my
homework... - And cue Harper.

03:04.444 --> 03:07.012
Hey, kid! How about you
blow off your homework,

03:07.047 --> 03:09.481
stay up late and play
a video game with us?

03:09.516 --> 03:11.650
What are you, scared?

03:14.354 --> 03:16.321
And then I jump out
from behind you,

03:16.355 --> 03:18.756
with fake blood dripping
down my pumpkin head.

03:18.791 --> 03:22.059
Everybody knows that
pumpkins don't have blood, Max.

03:22.094 --> 03:24.061
Yes! What do you think
they make the pies out of?

03:24.096 --> 03:26.930
- The inside stuff!
- Halloween...

03:26.965 --> 03:30.233
Is not about pumpkins
or blood or pies.

03:30.267 --> 03:32.201
It's about life lessons.

03:32.235 --> 03:33.702
Hello?

03:40.175 --> 03:42.810
I'm Mr. Evans of the Waverly
Place Merchant's Association.

03:42.844 --> 03:44.912
As you know, the Waverly
Place Halloween Fair

03:44.946 --> 03:47.347
is a very important
event tonight.

03:47.381 --> 03:50.183
Frankly, your haunted house has
been a disappointment since...

03:50.217 --> 03:51.717
Forever.

03:52.652 --> 03:54.186
The Association took a vote

03:54.220 --> 03:55.921
and we're taking away
your haunted house

03:55.955 --> 03:57.955
unless you make it
scarier this year.

03:57.989 --> 04:02.725
You know, normally I wouldn't
agree with people in ties,

04:02.759 --> 04:04.959
but Dave's got a point.

04:04.993 --> 04:07.194
You can't just take
it away from us.

04:07.228 --> 04:10.063
Dad. Someone in a position
of authority has spoken.

04:10.098 --> 04:13.699
No sense in fighting it.
Pack it up, Harper.

04:13.733 --> 04:16.334
Looks like tonight we're
doing a scary movie marathon.

04:16.368 --> 04:20.435
Hold on! Wait. You
guys can't just give up.

04:20.471 --> 04:24.439
All Mr. Evans says is that he wants
the haunted house to be scarier.

04:24.474 --> 04:27.575
Yes, much scarier.

04:27.609 --> 04:30.778
Like with ghosts and goblins

04:30.812 --> 04:35.681
and other things
out of this world?

04:37.517 --> 04:40.218
Out of this world.
Exactly.

04:40.253 --> 04:41.887
Rebel Russo here gets it.

04:41.921 --> 04:44.222
Jerry, this is your last shot
at the haunted house.

04:44.256 --> 04:46.691
Unless you make it
scary, you're done.

04:50.528 --> 04:53.430
Okay, all right, good save.
I'll give you that.

04:53.465 --> 04:56.066
But how are we going to do
something that's out of this world?

04:57.800 --> 04:58.935
I don't know.

04:58.969 --> 05:02.237
Let's have a family meeting
in our out of this world place.

05:03.872 --> 05:04.872
Dad! The lair.

05:10.145 --> 05:13.547
How can you guys not get
what I was hinting at?

05:13.581 --> 05:16.116
I used air quotes
around the words

05:16.150 --> 05:19.085
"out of this world"?

05:20.086 --> 05:21.653
Is that what that was?

05:21.688 --> 05:23.588
I thought that was
the Teen Wolf dance.

05:23.623 --> 05:24.723
You know, the...

05:30.329 --> 05:33.231
- Ignore him?
- Yes.

05:33.265 --> 05:37.233
Look, guys, I called this family meeting
to talk about the haunted house.

05:37.268 --> 05:39.002
It can't be a family
meeting without Mom.

05:39.036 --> 05:41.170
Who's gonna defend me when
I try and take minutes?

05:45.775 --> 05:48.977
"2:10, Alex breaks pencil."

05:49.011 --> 05:53.014
Look, I was the one
shooting my mouth off

05:53.049 --> 05:55.816
about how the haunted
house needs to be scarier.

05:55.851 --> 05:58.752
Then some dude with
a tie agreed with me.

05:58.786 --> 06:00.186
So here's what
we're gonna do.

06:00.221 --> 06:02.888
We're gonna use magic
to make it scary.

06:02.922 --> 06:05.723
If we're gonna use magic,
then Mom cannot know about it.

06:05.757 --> 06:09.759
- That's why she's not here. - I noticed
that, but I didn't want to say anything.

06:11.261 --> 06:14.930
You know what? Normally I say
no to the sneaky use of magic.

06:14.964 --> 06:18.032
But we could lose
the haunted house.

06:18.066 --> 06:21.235
Oh! We canse magic
sink the people down

06:21.269 --> 06:24.470
so that when they come in, we'll be
like giants trying to squish them.

06:24.705 --> 06:25.838
Okay.

06:25.872 --> 06:28.907
We'll use magic on the
haunted house. Good.

06:28.942 --> 06:32.244
But how are we gonna keep from
actually squishing the people?

06:32.278 --> 06:34.446
We're not. That's
what makes it scary.

06:34.480 --> 06:37.748
But your mom can't find out
that we're using magic.

06:37.783 --> 06:40.251
Okay, well...

06:40.285 --> 06:41.819
What about we get
road kill and...

06:41.853 --> 06:43.120
No.

06:44.856 --> 06:47.457
We can have a bleached
cow skull that has, like...

06:47.491 --> 06:48.958
No.

06:50.327 --> 06:52.361
At least let Harper and I

06:52.395 --> 06:54.463
go to the Ghost District
in the wizard world

06:54.497 --> 06:56.764
and get some reaghosts.

06:56.799 --> 07:00.168
Ghosts? I like it.

07:00.202 --> 07:01.869
But not too scary.

07:03.104 --> 07:04.938
Fine. But just
so you know,

07:04.972 --> 07:09.074
mildly scary ghosts leads to
a mildly scary haunted house.

07:09.109 --> 07:11.743
It's not gonna
be mildly scary,

07:11.778 --> 07:16.147
because we are gonna decorate
the Sub Station really scary.

07:16.181 --> 07:18.249
Come on!

07:26.222 --> 07:30.092
Who knew the ghost world was
right underneath the cemetery?

07:30.126 --> 07:31.526
That didn't take
long at all.

07:31.560 --> 07:35.963
Yep. Just as long as it takes
to dig up a grave and jump.

07:39.400 --> 07:40.934
What are all these
ghosts doing here?

07:40.968 --> 07:43.503
Oh, they're training
for Halloween!

07:43.537 --> 07:45.672
Trick or treat,
my dear.

07:45.706 --> 07:48.708
My dear?! That's not
the voice of someone

07:48.743 --> 07:51.411
trying to get enough candy in
one night to last a whole year.

07:52.614 --> 07:53.881
Try it again.

07:55.216 --> 07:57.384
Candy's all ghosts can eat.

07:57.418 --> 07:59.319
Oh, no wonder
they're so pale!

07:59.353 --> 08:01.720
Yeah. That and
the dead part, so...

08:03.389 --> 08:04.889
What do I do, Coach?

08:04.923 --> 08:07.689
I got my head in one hand
and a pillowcase in the other.

08:07.723 --> 08:09.290
Use your head, Doug.

08:09.325 --> 08:11.692
Okay, Coach.

08:17.397 --> 08:19.298
Watch me scare a ghost.

08:23.803 --> 08:25.704
Hello!

08:30.342 --> 08:33.177
Human alert!

08:33.211 --> 08:35.212
Everyone pretend
you're alive!

08:35.246 --> 08:38.914
Oh, relax, relax!
I'm a wizard.

08:42.217 --> 08:45.487
We're looking for ghosts who are scary,
but not too scary for our haunted house.

08:45.521 --> 08:47.456
I've got just
what you need.

08:47.490 --> 08:50.925
Wally! Frank! Miss
Chenowith! Fall in!

08:54.095 --> 08:57.331
Miss Chenowith knits
with her own bony fingers.

08:57.365 --> 09:00.333
You want me to knit
you a nice sweater?

09:01.569 --> 09:03.403
- You're hired.
- Yes!

09:04.371 --> 09:06.872
Nice day.
Forecast calls for...

09:06.906 --> 09:08.206
Brain!

09:10.175 --> 09:13.310
That terrible joke was
scary. You're hired.

09:14.412 --> 09:16.413
What about you, captain?
What do you got?

09:16.447 --> 09:19.015
I tell scary sea lore.

09:19.050 --> 09:21.618
About sharks that
eat ships and...

09:21.652 --> 09:23.986
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm not feeling you.

09:26.957 --> 09:28.690
What about that
creepy guy over there?

09:28.724 --> 09:31.259
Oh... You don't
want Mantooth.

09:31.293 --> 09:33.127
He's too scary.

09:33.162 --> 09:36.197
Mantooth? That
sounds familiar.

09:37.098 --> 09:38.332
Excuse me...

09:38.567 --> 09:41.200
Did you use to haunt
little kids while they slept?

09:41.235 --> 09:43.802
Hey, I'm a boogieman.

09:43.836 --> 09:45.103
I haunt kids.

09:45.137 --> 09:46.871
I scare babysitters.

09:46.906 --> 09:50.975
I throw shadows down the
end of dark hallways.

09:51.009 --> 09:53.443
Maybe you've
seen my work?

09:55.713 --> 09:57.079
He was the best.

09:57.114 --> 09:59.381
He scared this one kid
well into his teens.

09:59.416 --> 10:01.950
The kid would just hold up
his action figure and say,

10:01.985 --> 10:05.387
"Captain Jim Bob, protect me!
Captain Jim Bob, protect me!"

10:05.421 --> 10:08.923
Oh my gosh, you're talking about
my brother, Justin Russo!

10:08.957 --> 10:12.026
Crybaby Russo? I put
that kid on my resume!

10:14.296 --> 10:16.563
Dude! You're
like my hero!

10:16.597 --> 10:18.164
Oh, you have to
come back with us.

10:18.199 --> 10:19.799
Justin will freak out.

10:19.833 --> 10:22.001
Yeah, I do this crazy
thing with my face

10:22.035 --> 10:23.936
that had him diving
for the light switch.

10:23.970 --> 10:26.404
Wanna see it?

10:26.439 --> 10:28.206
I'm not doing it yet.

10:29.274 --> 10:31.408
Alex, we can't take
him with us.

10:31.442 --> 10:34.177
That's exactly the kind of "too
scary" we were told not to do.

10:34.211 --> 10:36.445
- No offense.
- None taken.

10:36.479 --> 10:38.479
I'm dead.
It's what I live for.

10:40.615 --> 10:45.985
Fine. All right, we'll take bony
fingers, skull guy, and story dude.

10:46.019 --> 10:48.988
That reminds me
of a scary story.

10:49.022 --> 10:51.924
There I was in a hot tub,

10:51.958 --> 10:54.859
the elastics on me
swim trunks broke.

10:54.894 --> 10:57.061
Can we just go,
please? Go!

11:05.903 --> 11:08.070
All right, Daddy.
I got what you ordered.

11:08.105 --> 11:10.906
Ghosts you can bring
home to Mom. Guys?

11:15.476 --> 11:16.976
They look pretty good.

11:17.011 --> 11:18.844
Not too scary.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.880
You know, I never understood why
they bury people with nice things.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.548
It's such a waste.

11:23.583 --> 11:25.183
Ahh, do you have
the correct time?

11:28.620 --> 11:29.687
Mom!

11:31.123 --> 11:32.790
So, who do we have here?

11:32.824 --> 11:35.626
Mom, these are some people

11:35.660 --> 11:38.628
from the youth club place,

11:38.662 --> 11:42.264
who are here to help us
actually with our haunted house.

11:43.099 --> 11:45.532
Yeah. They are...

11:45.567 --> 11:50.636
Going to pretend
to be ghosts.

11:52.738 --> 11:55.639
Well, I wanna join the youth club
place. Do you guys have a pool?

11:58.642 --> 12:01.178
You look so ghosty!

12:01.213 --> 12:05.484
We'll definitely be able to keep
our haunted house with this crew.

12:05.519 --> 12:07.720
Come on, let's see
you scare me.

12:10.257 --> 12:12.724
Why don't you
take the crystal ball

12:12.759 --> 12:14.526
and tell her
her fortune?

12:17.063 --> 12:20.364
Sorry, I have no
muscles or ligaments.

12:24.034 --> 12:26.435
A pleasure to...
Brain you.

12:29.572 --> 12:31.506
Sorry.

12:32.875 --> 12:33.874
Interesting.

12:35.510 --> 12:37.877
It was a dark
and stormy night.

12:37.912 --> 12:41.182
I was getting a check up
at the doctor's office.

12:41.216 --> 12:44.318
They had run out of toys
at the reception desk,

12:44.352 --> 12:46.853
so I had to settle
for a sticker.

12:48.055 --> 12:49.888
Hold on, hold on!

12:51.056 --> 12:52.923
This is it?

12:52.958 --> 12:55.493
These are our
scary ghosts?

12:56.228 --> 12:57.228
Yeah?

12:58.296 --> 13:00.231
Excuse me.

13:00.265 --> 13:03.534
You know, I normally
wouldn't condone this,

13:03.568 --> 13:05.136
but you might need to...

13:05.170 --> 13:07.071
Use a little...

13:07.105 --> 13:08.505
Magic...

13:08.540 --> 13:10.306
To come up with
some scarier ghosts.

13:10.340 --> 13:13.741
Save your breath, Mom. I've been
telling them this the whole time.

13:14.575 --> 13:17.108
Mom, these are real ghosts
from the wizard world.

13:17.842 --> 13:19.076
What?

13:24.161 --> 13:26.796
So you went to the wizard
world to get some scary ghosts

13:26.830 --> 13:29.364
and this was the
best you could do?

13:31.434 --> 13:34.739
I know. I had to follow
orders and get these losers.

13:34.773 --> 13:39.243
I was hoping for a guy
with saws for hands, but no.

13:39.278 --> 13:41.578
Who gave you
these orders?

13:43.847 --> 13:46.449
I can't hold it! She's gonna find
out about the family meeting.

13:47.483 --> 13:49.284
Justin, don't worry!

13:49.319 --> 13:51.753
I'm the father of this family,
and I will handle this.

13:53.421 --> 13:55.888
Alex called a family
meeting without you.

13:58.358 --> 14:00.025
Dad hides cookies
in his bathrobe!

14:01.395 --> 14:03.629
We all know that, honey.

14:05.832 --> 14:10.601
Look, normally I wouldn't be okay with this,
but we need a scary haunted house in an hour.

14:10.635 --> 14:13.005
An hour?!

14:13.039 --> 14:15.273
I should have taken
the earrings.

14:16.875 --> 14:19.809
You gotta go back to the wizard
world and get us some scarier ghosts.

14:19.843 --> 14:22.145
You know what'll
cheer everybody up?

14:22.179 --> 14:24.180
- Justin, give me a beat.
- No.

14:24.214 --> 14:25.748
Good enough.

14:32.920 --> 14:35.522
Look, this is a matter
of family pride, people,

14:35.557 --> 14:37.690
and we all know we haven't
had that in a while.

14:37.725 --> 14:39.658
Max, stop dancing!

14:41.760 --> 14:44.961
Mom. Mom, I've got it! All this
dancing just gave me an idea.

14:44.995 --> 14:48.132
- Oh, here we go!
- Everybody. Everyone.

14:48.167 --> 14:50.869
- Let's see where this goes.
- Thank you, Dad.

14:50.903 --> 14:55.371
Look, I've got a ghost costume that'll
blow away those frauds. Check it out!

15:02.778 --> 15:05.846
And it didn't go
anywhere good.

15:05.881 --> 15:07.714
You need to get
some scary ghosts.

15:07.748 --> 15:10.917
Oh, good idea! Should've
thought of that one on my own.

15:15.287 --> 15:18.556
So does everybody like?

15:25.962 --> 15:30.531
Dad! We sent Alex to the Ghost
World to save the day again.

15:30.565 --> 15:33.733
- What were we thinking? - I'm thinking
I should've made this with air holes.

15:33.768 --> 15:35.368
This thing is hot.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.704
Evans is gonna be here
any minute, guys.

15:38.738 --> 15:40.806
We're gonna have
to do it ourselves.

15:40.840 --> 15:44.042
Okay, Dad, you're the scary fortune
teller. Mom, hide behind that statue.

15:44.076 --> 15:47.578
Harper, you lead the groups. Max, you're
the ghost who jumps out at people.

15:47.613 --> 15:49.579
Yes.

15:49.614 --> 15:51.414
Let's scare those
kids, Ricky!

15:52.749 --> 15:54.282
What? I named
my mustache.

16:03.358 --> 16:04.858
Hey!

16:04.893 --> 16:07.027
Where is everybody?

16:07.061 --> 16:08.595
I need more ghosts.

16:08.630 --> 16:10.765
I need a pair of queens.

16:10.799 --> 16:13.234
And they can be
really scary this time.

16:13.268 --> 16:15.336
Do you have a ghost
with saws for hands?

16:15.370 --> 16:17.638
We're dead.
We're not freaks.

16:18.840 --> 16:20.408
Everyone's gone.
It's Halloween.

16:20.442 --> 16:22.676
They all went to the real
world to get candy.

16:22.711 --> 16:25.079
Don't look at me.
I have a massive headache.

16:27.516 --> 16:30.185
I hope it's nothing serious.

16:32.957 --> 16:35.224
Oh, come on, Doug!

16:35.259 --> 16:38.159
You're horrific
and you are hired.

16:39.961 --> 16:41.426
Mantooth!

16:41.460 --> 16:43.860
Hey, I'm back!

16:43.894 --> 16:46.695
Check it out. Someone left a
bowl with a sign on it that said,

16:46.730 --> 16:48.395
"just take one".

16:48.429 --> 16:49.962
So, I did.

16:51.363 --> 16:52.797
Okay, you're
coming with me.

16:52.831 --> 16:54.732
I need you to do that
thing with your face.

16:54.766 --> 16:56.733
Justin's just gonna
have to man up.

16:56.767 --> 16:58.300
No, no, no!
Not that way.

16:58.335 --> 17:01.337
I have to get some
earrings. For my friend.

17:05.040 --> 17:08.208
I can't climb
holding my head.

17:08.242 --> 17:09.442
Oh, gimme that!

17:12.378 --> 17:15.513
Now I have something in
my eye. Go on ahead!

17:24.388 --> 17:26.656
Welcome to the
Waverly Sub Station

17:26.691 --> 17:30.160
House of Horrors.

17:30.195 --> 17:31.728
Hey, good! We're off
to a good start.

17:31.763 --> 17:35.398
I like how you said,
"House of Horrors" all funny.

17:35.433 --> 17:37.800
Thank you. Hey, kid,
you getting all this?

17:39.336 --> 17:41.170
Follow me!

17:43.073 --> 17:45.441
Welcome to the
creepy Sub Station.

17:48.745 --> 17:52.013
Welcome.

17:52.048 --> 17:53.515
I know, I see it.

17:53.549 --> 17:56.784
I see something
in your future.

17:56.818 --> 18:00.353
Something...
Frightening.

18:03.590 --> 18:05.791
Okay, you're a hobo
on the back of a clown,

18:05.825 --> 18:07.826
looking at a head
of lettuce.

18:07.861 --> 18:10.395
Jerry, I see something
in your future, too,

18:10.429 --> 18:12.563
and it is also frightening.

18:12.598 --> 18:16.267
It is you bagging kettle corn at
next year's Halloween festival.

18:19.204 --> 18:22.005
Geez, tough crowd.

18:22.039 --> 18:23.873
Follow me!

18:25.775 --> 18:29.877
And follow me, kiddies,
to the Haunted Cemetery.

18:29.912 --> 18:34.314
Let's see what's behind
this creepy tombstone.

18:37.252 --> 18:41.421
I said, Tombstone!

18:43.190 --> 18:46.192
Boo! I got you, babe.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.060
I'm Cher.

18:50.562 --> 18:51.663
Fail!

18:52.497 --> 18:56.066
Boo! I'm the ghost
of mustaches past!

18:56.101 --> 18:59.202
And a talking tablecloth.
I'm trembling.

18:59.237 --> 19:00.370
Let's go!

19:00.405 --> 19:02.472
Hey! Hey, kids!

19:02.506 --> 19:05.575
You wanna hear the sound a
skeleton makes when it's cold?

19:09.078 --> 19:11.880
Wouldn't that be better
with a skull mask?

19:11.914 --> 19:14.549
That impairs my vision.
I could trip and fall.

19:14.583 --> 19:15.983
Don't tell the kids.

19:16.018 --> 19:18.852
This is so lame.
Come on, come on!

19:19.988 --> 19:21.888
Hey, guys, I got
something really scary.

19:21.923 --> 19:23.457
Oh, look!

19:23.491 --> 19:27.060
The rebel Russo's wearing
a shirt that says, "costume".

19:27.094 --> 19:29.595
It's so cool not
to try, isn't it?

19:29.630 --> 19:32.198
Thank you for noticing. I think
you'll enjoy this. Mantooth?

19:32.232 --> 19:34.934
Mantooth?

19:38.270 --> 19:40.938
Mr. Evans, watch this.
You're gonna freak out.

19:40.973 --> 19:42.606
What are you doing here?

19:42.641 --> 19:45.241
I'm not here to hide
under your bed.

19:45.276 --> 19:47.476
I'm here to save
your haunted house.

19:49.513 --> 19:52.414
But he turns his face into
this horrendous demon and...

19:52.449 --> 19:54.783
Pops out these vicious
claws and grabs you

19:54.818 --> 19:58.119
- while shrieking in your ears.
- That's exactly what we need.

19:58.153 --> 19:59.920
Well, is he gonna
do it or isn't he?

20:05.925 --> 20:08.125
Boogaly, boogaly,
boogaly, ha!

20:10.728 --> 20:12.496
Captain Jim Bob,
protect me!

20:14.164 --> 20:16.431
Oh, I should have known!

20:16.466 --> 20:19.066
Your incredibly scary
ghost turns out to be...

20:19.100 --> 20:22.034
Fingerhole eye guy.

20:22.069 --> 20:27.037
I don't know how much more of
this horror I can take. Let's go!

20:27.071 --> 20:29.405
That's not scary
enough for you?

20:29.439 --> 20:32.173
I've got a scarier face.

20:32.207 --> 20:33.641
Want to see it?

20:33.675 --> 20:35.375
Yes. Do it!

20:42.287 --> 20:44.856
- Boogaly, boogaly, boogaly...
- Not that thing.

20:46.392 --> 20:48.128
They all start that way.

20:52.467 --> 20:54.367
Boogaly, boogaly,
boogaly, boogaly...

20:59.673 --> 21:01.774
You're all sick,
you're sick people!

21:01.808 --> 21:04.176
This haunted house
is closed forever.

21:04.211 --> 21:07.413
Wait a minute! You said you
wanted scary, we gave you scary!

21:07.447 --> 21:09.982
Yes. Kids want to be scared,
not scarred for life.

21:10.017 --> 21:13.753
You're done. I'll see you in
the kettle corn stand next year.

21:21.427 --> 21:24.193
You know what's
great about this?

21:25.895 --> 21:27.761
Even though we failed,

21:27.796 --> 21:30.730
we failed together.

21:30.765 --> 21:33.266
You know, we all had a
little hand in this blow up.

21:33.300 --> 21:36.235
And I am so, so grateful
that I got to contribute.

21:36.269 --> 21:39.471
I mean, I'm proud.

21:40.439 --> 21:43.340
You know what?
Alex is right.

21:43.374 --> 21:45.608
I'm proud of us, too.

21:45.642 --> 21:47.911
I mean, look at this
place. We did this.

21:48.246 --> 21:50.213
Quick family meeting.

21:50.247 --> 21:52.982
We never send Alex to do
anything ever again. All in favor?

21:53.017 --> 21:55.118
Aye.

21:55.152 --> 21:56.620
Let's go get some candy!

22:01.375 --> 22:03.343
- All right, what ya got?
- I got...

22:03.377 --> 22:05.411
This watch that
doesn't work...

22:05.446 --> 22:07.513
Two earrings,

22:07.548 --> 22:09.315
and a picture of
a dog in a frame.

22:10.050 --> 22:11.916
I'll trade you
this necklace,

22:11.950 --> 22:15.619
a ring, and a glass eye
for the picture of the dog.

22:15.853 --> 22:16.920
Done.

22:19.556 --> 22:21.356
I love Halloween.
