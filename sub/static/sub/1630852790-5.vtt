00:39.250 --> 00:41.320
[Emergency Medical Center]

00:42.590 --> 00:44.220
Yes, dad.

00:44.220 --> 00:46.760
No, not yet.

00:46.760 --> 00:49.490
It'll still take some time.

00:56.900 --> 01:00.340
No! No! Don't!

01:50.060 --> 01:56.700
Can… Can you see me?

02:02.230 --> 02:07.210
Yes. I can see you.

02:14.350 --> 02:15.980
The patient's blood pressure keeps dropping.

02:15.980 --> 02:18.380
Dr. Go, what should we do?

02:21.850 --> 02:25.660
Then let's get it started.

02:49.510 --> 02:50.780
Why did they let him do it?

02:50.780 --> 02:52.680
Is Dr. An out of his mind?

02:52.680 --> 02:54.690
Hurry! The blood pressure is dropping!

02:54.690 --> 02:56.860
Dr. Go, what's your instruction?

02:56.860 --> 03:00.090
Gosh, the patient's heart will stop beating at this rate!

03:00.090 --> 03:04.830
Oh, no. We can't make that happen.

03:09.940 --> 03:12.270
Go Seung Tak, please leave.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.970
You can leave.

03:17.540 --> 03:20.079
Lee Seon Ho, you'll be the first assistant.

03:22.250 --> 03:24.850
What are you going to do?

03:24.850 --> 03:26.480
You are lucky that we are in the operating room.

03:26.480 --> 03:27.990
Get out of my sight right now!

03:27.990 --> 03:29.590
There's no way I'd leave the patient to you.

03:29.590 --> 03:32.290
Lee Seon Ho, didn't you hear me?

03:40.370 --> 03:41.630
Hey, you…

03:41.630 --> 03:43.800
Dr. An Tae Hyeon.

03:43.800 --> 03:47.040
Do you think you are qualified enough to operate on the patient?

03:47.040 --> 03:50.079
Don't you see that a life is in danger?

03:50.079 --> 03:50.840
Get out!

03:50.840 --> 03:52.740
What are you two doing?

03:52.740 --> 03:55.780
Are you trying to make the patient die?

04:17.300 --> 04:19.000
We have no time! Let's begin.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.010
Scalpel.

04:27.250 --> 04:28.980
Electrotome.

04:35.450 --> 04:38.720
What are you waiting for? Why don't you open the chest?

04:38.720 --> 04:40.630
Give me the scissors.

04:45.830 --> 04:48.000
The drill, please.

05:02.750 --> 05:05.320
Suction.

05:07.050 --> 05:10.020
Lee Seon Ho, suction.

05:10.020 --> 05:12.020
Suction.

05:28.740 --> 05:32.680
You should've been the one who operates.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.180
Why are you lying here?

05:35.180 --> 05:38.350
How much longer are you going to stay like this?

05:53.770 --> 05:56.740
I heard they let Go Seung Tak operate on a patient for cardiac tamponade.

05:56.740 --> 05:58.000
He's doing it right now.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
Dr. Go?

06:00.000 --> 06:01.610
If it's cardiac tamponade…

06:01.610 --> 06:05.080
Yes. Same as the operation Professor Cha received.

06:05.080 --> 06:07.950
It was right in the middle of the operation when he…

06:07.950 --> 06:11.450
Anyway, it's not like we don't have other surgeons.

06:11.450 --> 06:12.450
How could they let a new doctor

06:12.450 --> 06:14.320
conduct such a difficult operation?

06:14.320 --> 06:16.760
What are they thinking?

06:20.020 --> 06:23.030
What shall we do, Dr. Go?

06:30.140 --> 06:32.040
Cut.

06:36.670 --> 06:38.480
Cut.

06:40.850 --> 06:42.980
Dr. Lee will stitch the patient back up.

06:48.990 --> 06:51.659
As you asked, I saved the patient.

06:51.659 --> 06:54.690
I've left the rest to the others. Follow me out.

07:36.630 --> 07:40.000
Hey, stop.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.270
Go Seung Tak, come here!

07:43.270 --> 07:45.510
Go Seung Tak.

07:45.510 --> 07:47.510
You brat.

07:55.520 --> 07:59.120
It's only his first year. Is that possible?

07:59.120 --> 08:02.860
No. It's not. Absolutely not.

08:02.860 --> 08:05.960
New doctors may be able to perform cannulation.

08:04.260 --> 08:06.970
[Cannulation is a technique in which a cannula is placed inside a vein]

08:05.960 --> 08:09.530
And they may even make mistakes doing that.

08:09.530 --> 08:11.640
Has this ever happened before?

08:11.640 --> 08:13.540
Oh, yes, once.

08:13.540 --> 08:15.110
When Professor Cha was still an intern.

08:15.110 --> 08:16.570
Yeah, that's right.

08:16.570 --> 08:19.440
It's true. It was big news back then.

08:20.980 --> 08:23.310
Even so, how did it…?

08:25.520 --> 08:28.050
Go Seung Tak, I know you can see me!

08:28.050 --> 08:30.260
Why are you pretending you can't again?

08:30.260 --> 08:31.120
You can see me, can't you?

08:31.120 --> 08:32.490
You can see me. You can see my hand, can't you?

08:32.490 --> 08:35.830
Tell me! Tell me! Hey, you can see me, right?

08:35.830 --> 08:38.559
On the ceiling two meters away from here.

08:42.669 --> 08:43.799
Are you crazy?

08:43.799 --> 08:46.570
Why are you worried about the camera?

08:47.640 --> 08:50.070
You can see me, can't you?

08:57.620 --> 08:58.780
Do you remember here?

08:58.780 --> 08:59.850
The place where someone's body usually gets possessed

08:59.850 --> 09:01.720
in those horror-themed shows?

09:01.720 --> 09:05.060
Since when did you…

09:05.060 --> 09:06.960
Since when did you see me?

09:06.960 --> 09:07.630
About that…

09:07.630 --> 09:10.600
It started from that place and that moment on that day.

09:11.960 --> 09:15.430
So for all this time…

09:15.430 --> 09:16.830
Then why didn't you tell me?

09:16.830 --> 09:18.140
Why did you pretend that you couldn't see me?

09:18.140 --> 09:20.340
"I'm a ghost now. Can you see me?"

09:20.340 --> 09:21.540
You never asked that before.

09:21.540 --> 09:22.240
Why would I tell for no reason?

09:22.240 --> 09:23.070
You can only see me,

09:23.070 --> 09:26.440
or you can see the others, too?

09:34.090 --> 09:37.920
Can they see us today?

09:41.090 --> 09:43.860
Gee, they ignored us again.

09:43.860 --> 09:45.360
That's what they always do, isn't it?

09:45.360 --> 09:46.970
What else do you expect?

09:46.970 --> 09:48.770
Are their lives that lovely?

09:48.770 --> 09:51.040
I don't understand why they won't just give up.

09:51.040 --> 09:53.400
Just let go when the time is coming.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.710
Am I right?

09:55.710 --> 09:57.080
Hey! Hey!

09:57.080 --> 09:58.080
Unbelievable! He's so rude!

09:58.080 --> 09:58.980
Come on. Be cool.

09:58.980 --> 10:00.510
Let me go. I'll kill him.

10:00.510 --> 10:02.510
Don't be like that.

10:05.950 --> 10:08.320
I was almost possessed by several devils because of you.

10:08.320 --> 10:10.720
When I think back on that moment, it was so…

10:10.720 --> 10:11.920
You are isolated lately, aren't you?

10:11.920 --> 10:14.360
You should've done a better job.

10:16.790 --> 10:19.430
So even before that you could…

10:19.430 --> 10:20.870
You've always been able to…

10:20.870 --> 10:23.640
When did it start?

10:23.640 --> 10:26.740
Let's put it this way. You are the 250th devil I've seen.

10:26.740 --> 10:28.770
Hey, don't call me devil.

10:28.770 --> 10:31.040
Ghost. Call me ghost. Ghost.

10:31.040 --> 10:34.050
No. I have the right to choose what to call you.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.810
Why should I call you ghost instead of devil?

10:35.810 --> 10:38.580
Whatever. Then since when did you start seeing devils?

10:38.580 --> 10:40.390
D-Devils, no, I mean ghosts.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.750
I don't have to tell you my secrets.

10:42.750 --> 10:44.160
Wait a sec.

10:44.160 --> 10:45.720
You've been giving me short responses.

10:45.720 --> 10:47.260
How dare you talk to a professor like that?

10:47.260 --> 10:49.730
Is that even important at this point?

10:49.730 --> 10:52.500
It's not. What matters is why you confess now.

10:52.500 --> 10:53.500
Why don't you keep pretending?

10:53.500 --> 10:55.470
I told you, I wanted to save the patient.

10:55.470 --> 10:57.570
After all, I'm not the type who'd give up on others' lives.

10:57.570 --> 10:59.770
Oh, because you are not that type.

10:59.770 --> 11:01.070
Is that why you've been using me?

11:01.070 --> 11:03.140
Why did you do it since you knew?

11:03.140 --> 11:05.140
You were free and you had nothing to do anyway.

11:05.140 --> 11:06.080
I did it for your good.

11:06.080 --> 11:08.150
Really? Really?

11:08.150 --> 11:09.510
You did it because you were worried that I'd be bored?

11:09.510 --> 11:11.780
You are such a special young man, aren't you?

11:11.780 --> 11:13.520
You think I'd feel touched by that?

11:13.520 --> 11:14.950
I know what you are up to!

11:14.950 --> 11:17.420
So what? You think you know me well?

11:17.420 --> 11:18.820
Hold on.

11:18.960 --> 11:22.190
Then you went to my home… because…

11:22.190 --> 11:23.700
Oh, about that.

11:23.730 --> 11:25.060
You kept saying, "My kid, my kid."

11:25.060 --> 11:28.400
So I wondered if you really had a kid.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.300
Feel good?

11:32.300 --> 11:36.470
My kid is still alone at home without anything to eat.

11:36.470 --> 11:39.080
Bun, we'd better die together.

11:39.080 --> 11:41.210
I'm not taking my kid. I'll take you with me.

11:41.210 --> 11:42.350
Come here, Go Seung Tak.

11:42.350 --> 11:44.820
Come here.

11:46.580 --> 11:49.120
I didn't want to see you depressed, so I provoked you that day on purpose.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.990
And then you jumped at me and wanted to die together.

11:50.990 --> 11:52.290
Sir,

11:52.290 --> 11:55.030
do you know Professor Cha Yeong Min's home address?

11:55.030 --> 11:59.700
Oh, that's why I haven't seen him for so long.

11:59.700 --> 12:01.730
You are his student, right?

12:01.730 --> 12:03.770
Then please help him pack if you need anything.

12:03.770 --> 12:06.470
And please lock the door when you leave.

12:23.820 --> 12:26.960
I thought a famous doctor like him would be filthy rich and spend money like water.

12:26.960 --> 12:30.090
His apartment is quite simple actually.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.040
As it turns out,

12:41.040 --> 12:44.480
the "kid" he talked about… is this thing.

12:44.480 --> 12:46.480
My kid…

12:46.480 --> 12:47.450
Is he dead?

12:47.450 --> 12:49.280
The "kid" is a tough creature.

12:49.280 --> 12:53.450
I didn't know that I'd become a lifesaver for you and your kid.

12:53.450 --> 12:54.290
That's great.

12:54.290 --> 12:55.290
So where's my kid?

12:55.290 --> 12:56.050
Where did you put him?

12:56.050 --> 12:59.020
Wow, this is how it feels when you rescue someone from drowning, the first thing he asks for is his bag.

12:59.020 --> 13:01.530
How about you? Where did you put my "kid"?

13:01.530 --> 13:02.760
Are you asking me?

13:02.760 --> 13:03.800
You think I'd answer you?

13:03.800 --> 13:04.300
Are we that close?

13:04.300 --> 13:07.770
You jerk, haven't you asked me over 100 questions?

13:08.500 --> 13:10.300
You jerk?

13:10.300 --> 13:11.740
Hey, brat, don't take my patience for granted.

13:11.740 --> 13:14.240
Then let's talk about it. I've put up with you for a long time.

13:14.240 --> 13:15.570
Am I your son?

13:15.570 --> 13:16.870
Why do you keep calling me brat?

13:16.870 --> 13:17.740
What about you?

13:17.740 --> 13:18.840
Who asked him to get into an accident?

13:18.840 --> 13:19.940
It's his fate to end up like that.

13:19.940 --> 13:21.210
I have got to punch you to make you shut up.

13:21.210 --> 13:22.850
Wow, you are shifting the blame onto me now.

13:22.850 --> 13:24.050
Who should be angry now?

13:24.050 --> 13:25.480
You came into my body without my consent.

13:25.480 --> 13:27.020
Hey, you think I wanted to do that?

13:27.020 --> 13:28.450
I was so reluctant to…

13:28.450 --> 13:29.920
I had no choice but to pick an ill-mannered person like you

13:29.920 --> 13:31.020
to lodge my noble soul…

13:31.020 --> 13:32.090
Do you think I'm happy about that?

13:32.090 --> 13:34.090
I almost beat myself!

13:34.590 --> 13:37.860
Your bloody body is not so good.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.600
You can't even move your fingers flexibly.

13:39.600 --> 13:41.070
All you can do is talking glibly.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.430
I can at least talk as I like.

13:42.430 --> 13:45.340
You can't even open your eyes.

13:46.270 --> 13:49.270
How could you… say that to me?

13:49.270 --> 13:50.340
Hey!

13:50.340 --> 13:51.680
I won't get into your body again even if I have to die.

13:51.680 --> 13:53.440
I don't need your body, you brat!

13:53.440 --> 13:55.550
Any ghost can get into my body except you.

13:55.550 --> 13:56.480
Don't you dare get into my body again.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.550
If you get into my body again, I'll eat your soul.

13:58.550 --> 13:59.380
You brat.

13:59.380 --> 14:00.750
You talk to me rudely all along.

14:00.750 --> 14:01.520
You jerk.

14:01.520 --> 14:05.260
How could you be so rude to your professor flagrantly?

14:07.760 --> 14:09.360
Gosh, he just doesn't change,

14:09.360 --> 14:12.100
even as a ghost.

14:12.100 --> 14:14.070
He is out of danger for now.

14:14.070 --> 14:16.330
His surgery went smoothly.

14:16.330 --> 14:19.000
Doctor, is my husband alright?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.300
Thank you.

14:20.300 --> 14:22.240
Doctor, thank you so much.

14:22.240 --> 14:23.880
-Your dad is fine, Chae Hee.
-Really?

14:23.880 --> 14:25.110
Yes.

14:25.110 --> 14:27.480
Thank you, doctor.

14:27.480 --> 14:29.480
Thank you.

14:29.980 --> 14:31.480
That brat.

14:31.480 --> 14:33.350
He fooled me like that.

14:33.350 --> 14:35.290
And he talked back to me sputteringly.

14:35.290 --> 14:36.690
Wait.

14:36.690 --> 14:39.960
He asked me, a professor, to intubate for him.

14:39.960 --> 14:42.890
Well, should I worry about other people's lives now?

14:41.960 --> 14:45.000
[EunSang University Medical Center]

14:53.370 --> 14:54.210
Hello.

14:54.210 --> 14:56.970
He seems to be the patient whom Dr. Go Seung Tak operated on.

14:56.970 --> 14:58.740
It's said that the operation went perfectly.

14:58.740 --> 15:00.010
How did he manage to do that?

15:00.010 --> 15:00.680
Yes.

15:00.680 --> 15:04.250
He is only a first-year doctor here. It's incredible.

15:11.320 --> 15:12.720
He performed the operation, didn't he?

15:12.720 --> 15:13.420
Yes, he did.

15:13.420 --> 15:16.490
-Did he?
-Well, he did.

15:18.200 --> 15:22.730
To be honest, I knew Go Seung Tak was talented when he was a student.

15:22.730 --> 15:25.670
It seems that he is not just book-smart like a professor.

15:25.670 --> 15:26.840
Where did he work as an intern?

15:26.840 --> 15:28.770
The blood pressure is normal and so is the heart rate.

15:28.770 --> 15:29.570
How about the urine output?

15:29.570 --> 15:31.980
How much urine?

15:31.980 --> 15:33.010
It's 200cc.

15:33.010 --> 15:34.110
Good.

15:34.110 --> 15:36.010
Did you get the ABGA results?

15:34.280 --> 15:37.420
[ABGA Arterial Blood Gas Analysis]

15:36.010 --> 15:38.180
Did he receive private tutoring at some other hospital?

15:38.180 --> 15:40.320
Right! He ever studied in America.

15:40.320 --> 15:41.450
That must be the reason.

15:41.450 --> 15:43.550
The ABGA results, you brats.

15:43.550 --> 15:47.390
Go check whether the ABGA results are out.

15:47.390 --> 15:49.560
You know, in the movie "The Bourne Identity",

15:49.560 --> 15:50.930
Matt Damon accepts special training secretly

15:50.930 --> 15:53.000
to become an excellent secret agent.

15:53.000 --> 15:53.930
Great.

15:53.930 --> 15:55.570
The patient will be fine.

15:55.570 --> 15:56.630
Good.

15:56.630 --> 15:58.340
Check his conscious state every hour.

15:58.340 --> 15:59.170
So obviously,

15:59.170 --> 16:00.840
Go Seung Tak must have been taught by the world's top surgeon in private

16:00.840 --> 16:03.710
while he was studying abroad.

16:03.710 --> 16:06.910
Then he became a highly skilled doctor.

16:06.910 --> 16:08.210
Wait.

16:08.210 --> 16:12.220
Then why did he fail during Professor Cha's surgery?

16:12.220 --> 16:15.820
Hey, Surgeon Go.

16:17.460 --> 16:18.760
Why are you pulling a long face?

16:18.760 --> 16:21.230
You think I'm here to see you? I am here to check on the patient.

16:21.230 --> 16:23.230
His blood pressure, heart rate and urine output are all good.

16:23.230 --> 16:25.960
His ABGA results are also good.

16:26.830 --> 16:28.070
What are you waiting for?

16:28.070 --> 16:30.740
You have to give instructions. You are the surgeon.

16:34.970 --> 16:35.670
Why are you looking at me?

16:35.670 --> 16:39.080
Wh-wh-what? Do you think I'll tell you when you look at me?

16:39.080 --> 16:41.050
Are we on good terms?

16:41.950 --> 16:43.980
I have talked with his family.

16:43.780 --> 16:46.720
[Operation Record]

16:43.980 --> 16:46.820
You should write the Operation Record.

16:46.820 --> 16:50.520
Oh, the Operation Record.

16:50.520 --> 16:51.790
You don't know how to write it?

16:51.790 --> 16:53.920
Hey, how can you expect him to know that?

16:53.920 --> 16:54.790
He is Go Seung Tak.

16:54.790 --> 16:56.490
I am afraid he has never seen it.

16:59.700 --> 17:04.069
The chief ordered that before the patient comes round, the surgeon must stay with him.

17:04.069 --> 17:06.569
I guess you know why.

17:15.710 --> 17:19.020
You should feel lucky that we're in the operating room. Now get out of my face.

17:19.020 --> 17:20.849
I can't trust you with the patient.

17:20.849 --> 17:22.950
Dr. An Tae Hyeon,

17:22.950 --> 17:26.560
do you think you are qualified to treat the patient?

17:28.329 --> 17:29.060
Dr. An,

17:29.060 --> 17:30.930
are you insane?

17:30.930 --> 17:33.960
What exactly were you thinking? How could you let Go Seung Tak perform the operation?

17:33.960 --> 17:34.700
Sorry.

17:34.700 --> 17:37.900
Since the thing has happened, it's useless saying more.

17:37.900 --> 17:40.600
You'd better ensure this surgery will succeed.

17:41.240 --> 17:41.740
What?

17:41.740 --> 17:43.310
You are lucky that the patient is still alive.

17:43.310 --> 17:45.440
There were other doctors available at our hospital at that time.

17:45.440 --> 17:49.380
Do you know it'll be a big problem if people find out the operation was performed by a resident?

17:49.380 --> 17:51.450
We had already attracted criticism before for performing operation by residents.

17:51.450 --> 17:52.820
You think you will the only one who will be ruined?

17:52.820 --> 17:55.850
No. All of us will be ruined.

17:55.850 --> 17:56.290
I got it,

17:56.290 --> 17:57.420
sir.

17:57.420 --> 17:58.660
Anyway,

17:58.660 --> 17:59.960
about Go Seung Tak,

17:59.960 --> 18:02.160
did you find anything strange?

18:02.160 --> 18:03.590
What?

18:03.590 --> 18:05.030
What do you mean?

18:05.030 --> 18:06.100
Er,

18:06.100 --> 18:06.730
nothing,

18:06.760 --> 18:08.230
nothing.

18:08.230 --> 18:12.100
Well, he performed the operation successfully, which is suspicious.

18:12.100 --> 18:13.000
Wait.

18:13.000 --> 18:13.640
Does this suggest that

18:13.640 --> 18:15.440
he is a genius?

18:15.440 --> 18:18.080
It's only… because he is a genius?

18:18.080 --> 18:20.080
How could he become a genius overnight?

18:20.080 --> 18:22.580
He was obviously not a genius when he was an intern.

18:22.580 --> 18:24.180
He changed suddenly.

18:24.180 --> 18:26.450
He changed into a genius suddenly?

18:41.300 --> 18:42.900
This is Vice President of Administration.

18:42.900 --> 18:46.240
Has the operation in Operating Room 7 just now been recorded?

18:46.240 --> 18:49.340
Send me the full video immediately.

18:59.250 --> 19:04.090
Hey, if you are still here, save him, please.

19:04.090 --> 19:05.390
Since when?

19:05.390 --> 19:06.660
When did you start to see me?

19:06.660 --> 19:07.360
Well,

19:07.360 --> 19:08.660
it just started at that moment on that day

19:08.660 --> 19:10.660
in that place.

19:13.630 --> 19:16.570
I feel uncomfortable when you are here. Could you leave?

19:16.570 --> 19:18.270
My patient is lying here. How can I leave?

19:18.270 --> 19:19.300
If you don't want to be here, you can leave.

19:19.300 --> 19:21.110
Didn't you hear they called me the surgeon?

19:21.110 --> 19:21.970
I performed the operation.

19:21.970 --> 19:22.740
You did it with my hands.

19:22.740 --> 19:25.080
You even didn't dare to hold the scalpel. How can you boast about it?

19:25.080 --> 19:27.280
What is the use of your nimble fingers? You can't even touch the patient.

19:27.280 --> 19:28.410
You brat, why must you touch my sore spot?

19:28.410 --> 19:32.850
I have to destroy your tongue with my punches. Damn!

19:32.850 --> 19:34.150
Sir,

19:34.150 --> 19:35.150
are you awake?

19:35.150 --> 19:37.020
Start with obeying command. The patient's name.

19:35.190 --> 19:38.660
[Obey command: To determine the patient's ability to obey a command of a doctor.]

19:37.020 --> 19:38.860
Mr. Moon Suk Joo.

19:38.860 --> 19:39.960
Blink for yes.

19:39.960 --> 19:42.730
Blink if you want to say yes.

19:42.730 --> 19:43.390
He is conscious.

19:43.390 --> 19:44.090
Next, motor check.

19:43.530 --> 19:47.230
[Motor check: To check if motor function is intact.]

19:44.090 --> 19:45.130
Start with the left hand.

19:45.130 --> 19:48.130
Try moving your left hand.

19:49.230 --> 19:51.570
Move your right hand.

19:51.570 --> 19:53.300
-Very good. Next…
-Your daughter.

19:53.300 --> 19:55.870
Do you remember the name of your daughter?

19:55.870 --> 19:58.980
If you remember, nod your head please.

20:01.710 --> 20:03.550
Your family is fine.

20:03.550 --> 20:06.150
Don't worry about them.

20:08.990 --> 20:12.890
Chae Hee really looks like you.

20:18.830 --> 20:21.500
Are you alright?

20:21.500 --> 20:23.370
Are you awake?

20:23.370 --> 20:25.870
Dad.

20:25.870 --> 20:29.110
Dad, are you alright?

20:29.110 --> 20:31.340
Your dad said he was fine.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.600
When did he ever care so much about the patient?

20:58.600 --> 20:59.840
Did he perform the operation?

20:59.840 --> 21:01.840
No. I did it.

21:23.890 --> 21:25.600
Sorry.

21:25.600 --> 21:28.470
I had to do that under the circumstance today.

21:28.470 --> 21:30.300
I'll be careful from now on.

21:30.300 --> 21:32.670
Yeong Min,

21:32.670 --> 21:38.410
I heard Dr. Go performed the operation smoothly today.

21:38.410 --> 21:42.610
He made it all the way through this time. He did a good job.

21:42.610 --> 21:46.180
As a young doctor, he is very impressive, right?

21:49.220 --> 21:54.160
Why didn't he do so well when he operated on you?

21:54.160 --> 21:56.590
Exactly.

21:58.060 --> 21:59.830
However,

21:59.830 --> 22:04.000
what is your relationship with Dr. Go?

22:04.000 --> 22:07.840
Dr. Go said that you two disliked each other,

22:07.840 --> 22:10.840
but his behavior didn't seem to prove that.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.680
Really?

22:12.680 --> 22:17.050
He is really an odd person.

22:17.050 --> 22:19.620
He is a total oddball.

22:21.390 --> 22:23.350
From today onward, I will work with you.

22:23.350 --> 22:24.190
I am a resident

22:24.190 --> 22:27.930
and my name is Go Seung Tak.

22:27.930 --> 22:32.500
Let's… save the patient first.

22:32.500 --> 22:34.330
Cha Yeong Min.

22:34.330 --> 22:35.700
Since when did you start seeing devils?

22:35.700 --> 22:37.330
D-Devils, no, I mean ghosts.

22:37.330 --> 22:39.970
I don't have to tell you my secrets.

22:41.110 --> 22:44.270
What did that guy go through?

22:49.780 --> 22:52.820
You came back, my son.

22:52.820 --> 22:54.390
Did you take the taxi?

22:54.390 --> 22:56.250
What about your car?

22:56.250 --> 22:57.220
Eh,

22:57.220 --> 22:58.390
I thought driving was too tiring,

22:58.390 --> 22:59.620
so I left it at the medical center parking lot.

22:59.620 --> 23:00.820
What's the matter?

23:00.820 --> 23:02.460
Did something happen?

23:02.460 --> 23:06.400
Nothing, I just feel my mom is so beautiful today.

23:42.330 --> 23:43.700
Seung Tak.

23:48.170 --> 23:49.770
Dad.

23:52.210 --> 23:57.650
Dad.

24:02.820 --> 24:05.060
I've heard that the patient has a daughter.

24:05.060 --> 24:05.860
Yes, President.

24:05.860 --> 24:07.860
He has a seven-year-old daughter.

24:07.860 --> 24:10.930
Fortunately, the child was not injured and is safe and sound.

24:10.930 --> 24:14.030
Her dad regained consciousness, thank goodness.

24:14.030 --> 24:16.100
Seung Tak did a great job on the operation.

24:16.100 --> 24:17.940
Right now the patient's state is good, too.

24:31.520 --> 24:33.550
The room is not cleaned.

24:33.550 --> 24:34.920
Well, no,

24:34.920 --> 24:37.420
it's not like I wanted to do it yesterday,

24:37.420 --> 24:38.690
but I had to.

24:38.690 --> 24:40.960
The patient was in danger,

24:40.960 --> 24:44.700
and I could not leave him to An Tae Hyeon and that guy.

24:47.430 --> 24:49.500
Jeo.

24:50.430 --> 24:51.070
What's the matter?

24:51.070 --> 24:52.670
Where does the mosquito come from?

24:52.670 --> 24:54.710
Die.

25:05.820 --> 25:09.120
What do those guys want? Really.

26:58.030 --> 27:00.500
Nice scenery here.

27:00.500 --> 27:01.500
What are you?

27:01.500 --> 27:02.930
Why do you come here?

27:04.470 --> 27:06.670
Doctor Go, what's the matter?

27:09.840 --> 27:11.610
I received this yesterday.

27:11.610 --> 27:13.110
Illegal parking.

27:13.110 --> 27:15.250
In the area dedicated to firefighting facilities.

27:15.250 --> 27:16.480
Thanks to you, my fine is like...

27:16.480 --> 27:17.710
Oh, sorry.

27:17.710 --> 27:18.980
It's too dark, I couldn't see clearly.

27:18.980 --> 27:20.880
The white car and blue car were parked neatly together.

27:20.880 --> 27:22.090
Thanks to you, my fine is like...

27:22.090 --> 27:23.450
Wait a second, what's this?

27:23.450 --> 27:24.550
What does that mean?

27:24.550 --> 27:26.660
Cha Yeong Min is an arrogant and selfish man.

27:26.660 --> 27:28.630
He lacks empathy,

27:28.630 --> 27:31.400
like this, and he also lacks moral concept.

27:31.400 --> 27:32.800
It's good nothing happened.

27:32.800 --> 27:35.070
If there's a fire, it'll be a big problem.

27:35.070 --> 27:35.770
Fire.

27:35.770 --> 27:37.200
Hey.

27:37.200 --> 27:38.840
I know. You talk to me about it.

27:38.840 --> 27:39.670
Let's talk alone.

27:39.670 --> 27:41.570
It's still not late, you should think carefully.

27:41.570 --> 27:44.210
Does he deserve your

27:44.210 --> 27:45.510
excellent strength, good character,

27:45.510 --> 27:46.980
and precious time?

27:46.980 --> 27:47.680
Then farewell.

27:48.810 --> 27:50.080
Come here.

27:50.080 --> 27:51.110
You uneducated...

27:51.110 --> 27:51.950
You come here.

27:51.950 --> 27:53.020
Go Seung Tak.

27:53.020 --> 27:55.150
What is he talking about?

27:55.150 --> 27:57.820
Go Seung Tak.

27:57.820 --> 27:59.790
What just happened?

27:59.790 --> 28:01.590
This guy is so weird.

28:03.990 --> 28:05.130
You,

28:05.130 --> 28:06.100
how dare you scold me behind my back

28:06.100 --> 28:07.360
in front of my face?

28:07.360 --> 28:08.700
How can somebody scold you both in front of your face

28:08.700 --> 28:09.870
and behind your back?

28:09.870 --> 28:11.570
And, what about moral concept?

28:11.570 --> 28:12.600
Because I became like this,

28:12.600 --> 28:13.570
you think me, a professor, is hilarious, right?

28:13.570 --> 28:14.670
Professor, before you became like this,

28:14.670 --> 28:16.070
I didn't treat you seriously, either.

28:16.070 --> 28:17.440
It's not news.

28:18.840 --> 28:20.410
Of course people make mistakes.

28:20.410 --> 28:22.550
I really didn't know that, and there's no fire.

28:22.550 --> 28:25.220
It's fortunately to have no fire, and you found the cars because of it.

28:25.220 --> 28:27.120
That's great, think about it that way.

28:27.120 --> 28:28.820
One way or another, I found your baby back.

28:28.820 --> 28:29.550
Take my baby to me.

28:29.550 --> 28:31.560
Two cars parked at dedicated area for firefighting facilities.

28:31.560 --> 28:33.320
The total fine is 1 million won.

28:35.790 --> 28:37.190
Noted. Take my baby to me.

28:37.190 --> 28:39.430
If you want your baby, pay first.

28:39.430 --> 28:40.060
Wow, how can you

28:40.060 --> 28:41.200
use my baby as hostage?

28:41.200 --> 28:44.270
Hey, how can I pay?

28:45.870 --> 28:47.700
Are you Doctor Go Seung Tak?

28:49.710 --> 28:51.840
I'll call you later.

28:53.140 --> 28:54.210
What's the matter?

28:54.210 --> 28:57.150
I'm a journalist from the medical column of Civilian News.

28:57.150 --> 29:00.350
I want to know the details of the surgery you did yesterday.

29:00.350 --> 29:03.020
I heard that you performed the operation alone under an impossible circumstance,

29:03.020 --> 29:04.860
and saved the patient miraculously.

29:04.860 --> 29:06.860
Is that true?

29:06.860 --> 29:09.560
The new resident physician in Thoracic Surgery Department, EunSang University Medical Center,

29:09.560 --> 29:11.930
performed heart surgery alone on a patient who had a traffic accident

29:11.930 --> 29:13.660
and attracted attention.

29:13.660 --> 29:15.770
A single operation that even the senior resident physician has never done before.

29:15.770 --> 29:17.030
Go Seung Tak actually...

29:19.070 --> 29:22.840
When the physician in charge

29:22.840 --> 29:26.080
suffered pain from a wrist injury, the operation could not be carried out,

29:26.080 --> 29:27.440
in such a crisis,

29:27.440 --> 29:30.250
like he was possessed by a divinity, Doctor Go Seung Tak exerted his hidden power,

29:30.250 --> 29:33.020
and saved the life of the dying patient.

29:33.020 --> 29:34.250
Who is it?

29:34.250 --> 29:36.790
Why did he perform the surgery with a hurt wrist?

29:36.790 --> 29:40.190
We found out that at that moment, Doctor Go Seung Tak couldn't abandon the patient

29:40.190 --> 29:43.830
for a special secret.

29:45.100 --> 29:46.730
Do you know anything?

29:46.730 --> 29:47.860
What?

29:47.860 --> 29:49.370
No, I don't know.

29:49.370 --> 29:52.970
The strength and ability of the young doctor is worthy of praise.

29:52.970 --> 29:54.070
He's the hero of this era,

29:54.070 --> 29:55.440
and the hero in the operating room.

29:55.440 --> 29:56.310
Fighting.

29:56.310 --> 29:58.480
It wasn't easy for me to silence the operating room staff.

29:58.480 --> 29:59.680
What happened?

29:59.680 --> 30:01.750
For this situation, although I don't know who it is,

30:00.000 --> 30:30.000
[Translated by iQIYI]

30:01.750 --> 30:03.750
but the finishing touches are very well done.

30:03.750 --> 30:06.920
Well, could it be the Chief?

30:09.150 --> 30:10.520
Is this your work?

30:12.720 --> 30:14.520
Good things need to be widely publicized.

30:14.520 --> 30:16.130
I'm here to do all this stuff.

30:16.130 --> 30:17.130
God.

30:17.130 --> 30:18.430
You colluded with others against him before,

30:18.430 --> 30:19.960
why are you making him look good now?

30:19.960 --> 30:21.970
It is not a good thing to widely publicize this matter, right?

30:21.970 --> 30:24.430
Recently, many problems pop up like

30:24.430 --> 30:25.840
unqualified doctors perform surgery on other's behalf, don't you know it?

30:25.840 --> 30:29.970
Those are unqualified people, but you are qualified.

30:29.970 --> 30:32.440
My little brother's skill on making people surprised

30:32.440 --> 30:34.040
is getting better and better.

30:34.040 --> 30:35.780
Portrait rights and infringement of personal privacy,

30:35.780 --> 30:37.880
where should these be reported?

30:37.880 --> 30:39.250
Personal privacy,

30:40.680 --> 30:42.720
you mean personal secret. This,

30:42.720 --> 30:46.520
we didn't explain carefully.

30:46.520 --> 30:48.730
It's not like you can cover a thing like this.

30:48.730 --> 30:50.260
Sooner or later it will be made public,

30:50.260 --> 30:52.030
I just made the first move

30:52.030 --> 30:54.260
so that I could make you look really good.

30:54.260 --> 30:56.270
Professor Cha is in a state like that,

30:56.270 --> 30:58.000
and we need a new cover star.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.140
Unbelievable.

31:00.140 --> 31:01.710
Calm down. Three times one is three, three times two is six.

31:01.710 --> 31:02.840
Right? Three...

31:02.840 --> 31:04.340
I am a resident physician

31:04.340 --> 31:05.940
in my first year.

31:07.180 --> 31:08.650
But why did you want to do that?

31:08.650 --> 31:11.680
I've heard that it was you who stepped forward to do the surgery.

31:11.680 --> 31:13.550
This guy is really...

31:13.550 --> 31:15.490
Hey, what sin does he have?

31:15.490 --> 31:16.950
If they had transferred away the patient,

31:16.950 --> 31:19.160
then he might have lost his life on the way.

31:19.160 --> 31:21.890
The situation was so urgent. He just wanted to save the patient.

31:21.890 --> 31:24.060
Since these are mentioned, let me ask you,

31:24.060 --> 31:26.300
did you learn the skill somewhere else?

31:26.300 --> 31:29.600
MBA doesn't offer medical internship.

31:29.600 --> 31:31.370
MBA, really?

31:31.370 --> 31:34.600
Your grandpa found out that you were skipping school and playing around,

31:34.600 --> 31:36.440
and then forced you to go back. I know about all these.

31:37.270 --> 31:41.880
Say, you really learned something nice.

31:47.680 --> 31:50.120
These masters are so...

31:51.490 --> 31:52.960
Hello, Mom.

31:54.420 --> 31:56.030
Hello, Chairman Go.

31:56.030 --> 31:57.230
I'm startled.

31:57.960 --> 31:59.300
About that?

31:59.300 --> 32:01.670
No, I'm just letting him be the hero for now.

32:01.670 --> 32:04.000
I just paved the way for him.

32:06.600 --> 32:07.440
My son,

32:07.440 --> 32:09.170
is that report true?

32:09.170 --> 32:13.180
Is that you who saved the patient in crisis?

32:13.180 --> 32:14.540
It seems to be him.

32:14.540 --> 32:15.450
How handsome!

32:15.450 --> 32:16.550
It seems to be right.

32:16.550 --> 32:19.650
Gee, my son is so cool.

32:19.650 --> 32:22.090
I've heard that you did it from the beginning till the end.

32:22.090 --> 32:23.390
And the patient woke up safely.

32:23.390 --> 32:26.460
My son is a genius.

32:27.420 --> 32:29.930
I don't think that's right.

32:30.730 --> 32:31.960
Well, Mom.

32:32.660 --> 32:34.660
I'm a bit busy,

32:34.660 --> 32:36.070
can we talk later?

32:36.070 --> 32:37.970
Why not?

32:37.970 --> 32:39.570
My genius son,

32:39.570 --> 32:41.140
when will you get home?

32:41.140 --> 32:42.470
So?

32:42.470 --> 32:44.640
Why are you holding him so high?

32:44.640 --> 32:48.510
The higher he is now, the more miserable he'll be when he falls, right?

32:48.510 --> 32:52.320
A lot of people are paying attention. That can be deadly.

32:55.920 --> 32:58.220
Don't worry.

32:58.220 --> 33:03.030
That guy can never get the specialist qualification certificate.

33:09.900 --> 33:11.400
You came.

33:15.940 --> 33:17.010
Thank you.

33:24.150 --> 33:27.320
Tak is indeed a character.

33:27.320 --> 33:29.950
He gets the attention wherever he goes.

33:29.950 --> 33:32.020
Vice President Han is so powerful.

33:32.020 --> 33:33.060
He just moved his fingers,

33:33.060 --> 33:35.160
and he packed him like this.

33:35.160 --> 33:37.460
At least he's going to do that, right?

33:37.460 --> 33:40.400
Not to mention the younger brother who will lead the consortium in the future.

33:40.400 --> 33:42.100
You don't know how grateful I am

33:42.100 --> 33:46.040
to have such a reliable big brother for my Seung Tak.

33:46.570 --> 33:49.240
My old lady must feel at ease.

33:49.240 --> 33:50.410
She has two reliable grandsons

33:50.410 --> 33:53.510
stay in the hospital.

34:03.350 --> 34:04.220
I'm in this state,

34:04.220 --> 34:06.360
but your life is hard, too.

34:06.360 --> 34:09.260
Being besieged on all sides. Being besieged on all sides. Ah...

34:11.090 --> 34:13.100
Well...

34:14.260 --> 34:17.330
Let's find a quiet place to talk.

34:17.330 --> 34:20.400
We don't want to rob you,

34:20.400 --> 34:21.870
right, my children?

34:21.870 --> 34:24.040
Go there and don't play tricks.

34:24.040 --> 34:26.179
Go where?

34:45.260 --> 34:47.360
Hey, my little patient.

34:49.670 --> 34:51.130
What's the matter? What are you doing?

34:51.130 --> 34:53.139
I'm playing hide-and-seek.

34:53.639 --> 34:54.440
With whom?

34:54.440 --> 34:55.610
With my mom.

34:55.610 --> 34:57.810
You go that way.

34:58.410 --> 35:00.610
Do you think it's OK to hide like this?

35:00.610 --> 35:02.980
And you cannot wander around.

35:02.980 --> 35:04.910
Hurry and go to your ward.

35:04.910 --> 35:07.180
Go away.

35:13.220 --> 35:15.460
I want to hide, too.

35:15.460 --> 35:17.460
To bury my head.

35:20.260 --> 35:21.730
Go Seung Tak, here you come.

35:21.730 --> 35:23.300
I want to ask you something.

35:23.300 --> 35:24.230
About yesterday...

35:24.230 --> 35:25.670
It was not me.

35:25.670 --> 35:27.400
What? Who would it be if it's not you?

35:27.400 --> 35:30.270
Don't you watch the news? I was possessed.

35:30.270 --> 35:31.110
Really?

35:31.110 --> 35:33.410
It wouldn't happen again.

35:33.410 --> 35:35.350
Everything will be back to normal.

35:35.350 --> 35:38.880
How can you know if things like that would not happen again?

35:38.880 --> 35:40.580
I made a deal with that ghost.

35:40.580 --> 35:42.290
Really?

35:42.290 --> 35:46.620
Doctor, please do the operation for my Seung Jo.

35:46.620 --> 35:49.330
If he doesn't receive the treatment, he will die.

35:49.330 --> 35:52.800
Seung Jo's guardian is asking if they have to leave the hospital tomorrow.

35:52.800 --> 35:54.160
Do they have to leave?

35:54.160 --> 35:56.000
What else? We don't have any doctor who can do the surgery.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.570
Isn't it true that the right ventricular catheter just needs to be replaced?

35:58.570 --> 35:59.840
Is it that hard?

35:59.840 --> 36:01.500
Yes, it is.

36:01.500 --> 36:03.810
Because he also needs the CABG.

36:01.940 --> 36:04.010
[CABG: Coronary artery bypass graft surgery]

36:04.510 --> 36:07.510
The operation is difficult, and this is not his patient.

36:07.510 --> 36:09.550
What if he touches a wrong place, and something happens to the child?

36:09.550 --> 36:10.550
Then he will have to take full responsibility.

36:10.550 --> 36:12.850
Doctor, please.

36:12.850 --> 36:14.980
We have nowhere else to go.

36:14.980 --> 36:17.590
Are doctors always like this?

36:17.590 --> 36:19.820
Sometimes.

36:20.990 --> 36:24.230
I am worried that if any other hospital can find a qualified doctor.

36:24.230 --> 36:25.760
Why?

36:25.760 --> 36:27.560
The operation fee.

36:27.560 --> 36:31.300
Originally, our hospital wanted to reimburse her in full for the treatment and hospitalization expenses.

36:31.300 --> 36:34.300
The donations from Professor Cha's surgery on the wealthy

36:34.300 --> 36:36.710
are in the hospital.

36:37.310 --> 36:40.880
There really is something I don't know about this hospital.

36:41.380 --> 36:45.650
It exists. It's the money only Professor Cha Yeong Min can spend.

36:45.650 --> 36:47.750
Professor Cha seems harsh,

36:47.750 --> 36:50.020
but sometimes he surprises people.

36:50.020 --> 36:51.790
Especially when he ignored those things requested by superiors

36:51.790 --> 36:52.860
and powerful people.

36:52.860 --> 36:56.330
Wow, he's handsome when he does that.

36:57.930 --> 36:59.730
Requests?

37:05.600 --> 37:07.870
Well, what are your requests for me?

37:07.870 --> 37:09.840
Nothing special.

37:09.840 --> 37:12.040
Go to the Yeong Deung Po underground commercial street,

37:12.040 --> 37:13.980
and find the walnut biscuit stall.

37:13.980 --> 37:16.580
Please, I want to taste it.

37:16.580 --> 37:18.510
Find me a movie DVD.

37:18.510 --> 37:19.880
I want to read a book,

37:19.880 --> 37:22.090
but only one library has that copy.

37:22.090 --> 37:25.460
Gee, how can I get any of those?

37:25.460 --> 37:26.320
Don't you know?

37:26.320 --> 37:28.490
We are in the same state.

37:28.490 --> 37:30.360
Wow, it's the same.

37:30.360 --> 37:33.530
Come on, Professor Cha, you have the method.

37:33.530 --> 37:36.270
Like, with a beep.

37:36.270 --> 37:37.830
So what you mean is that

37:37.830 --> 37:40.440
let me turn to that guy?

37:40.440 --> 37:42.940
Who has the same state with whom? See?

37:42.940 --> 37:44.570
I knew he would be like this.

37:44.570 --> 37:46.740
Why should we expect such an uneducated person?

37:46.740 --> 37:47.910
Hey, who are you pointing at?

37:47.910 --> 37:50.580
Come back! How old are you? How old is he?

37:50.580 --> 37:51.750
Come on, Professor Cha.

37:51.750 --> 37:53.880
You even have saved a life in that way.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.990
Stop pretending. Think about it.

37:55.990 --> 37:59.990
Otherwise, you'll have a hard time here.

37:59.990 --> 38:02.790
Tell us whatever you want to eat.

38:04.860 --> 38:08.200
Not just Seung Jo's, maybe all the appointments of Professor Cha

38:08.200 --> 38:10.470
will have to be canceled one by one.

38:10.470 --> 38:14.040
Alas, what a big loss it is to lose a professor!

38:20.710 --> 38:21.910
The patient with cardiac tamponade is better

38:21.910 --> 38:23.480
and has been transferred to the general ward.

38:23.480 --> 38:24.750
The wound needs to be treated.

38:24.750 --> 38:27.780
What to do? Will I take care of it, too?

38:33.660 --> 38:35.220
Ugh, how could he order Lee Seon Ho about at that time?

38:35.220 --> 38:37.630
Really so muddleheaded?

38:39.030 --> 38:40.460
Found you!

38:41.830 --> 38:43.400
How did you find me?

38:43.400 --> 38:45.200
Because my eyes are so big.

38:45.200 --> 38:46.940
Wow.

38:46.940 --> 38:47.770
What do we do now?

38:47.770 --> 38:49.340
Well, what do you want to do?

38:49.340 --> 38:53.280
Seung Jo is not her own son.

38:53.280 --> 38:55.550
It's said that she adopted him as a baby.

38:55.550 --> 38:57.110
But the kid has been ill for long.

38:57.110 --> 39:00.020
The family couldn't afford surgery and hospitalization.

39:00.020 --> 39:01.520
So the father wanted to send the child back.

39:01.520 --> 39:04.020
But the mother insisted on keeping him.

39:04.820 --> 39:07.190
Finally, they got divorced and she's been raising the kid alone ever since.

39:11.660 --> 39:13.230
Do you want to play finger games?

39:13.230 --> 39:14.800
Sure.

39:17.070 --> 39:20.200
Thank you, doctor.

39:20.200 --> 39:21.570
Uh?

39:21.570 --> 39:22.540
Oh.

39:22.540 --> 39:24.540
Thank you, doctor.

39:24.540 --> 39:29.380
We just knew that you were the one who did the operation yesterday.

39:31.780 --> 39:35.720
Really thank you for saving my husband.

39:35.720 --> 39:37.150
Thank you, doctor.

39:37.150 --> 39:37.920
You are welcome.

39:37.920 --> 39:41.890
I'll never forget your kindness. Thank you, doctor.

39:54.340 --> 39:57.940
Hmmm, wound treatment.

39:57.940 --> 40:00.680
Doctor, you should clean the chest and then do the squeezing.

40:01.210 --> 40:03.450
Sure, the squeezing.

40:03.450 --> 40:04.780
Well…

40:04.780 --> 40:10.650
Clean the sticky hematoma in the chest, right?

40:30.370 --> 40:32.580
What? Walnut biscuits?

40:32.580 --> 40:35.550
Go get a DVD? What a bunch of savages!

40:35.550 --> 40:38.250
How dare you ask for these things?

40:41.780 --> 40:43.850
What is he doing?

40:47.760 --> 40:49.130
Oh, my!

40:49.130 --> 40:50.430
Ugh, those unreliable hands.

40:50.430 --> 40:52.630
Is there anything you can do well?

40:52.630 --> 40:55.400
-Oh dear!
-What to do?

40:58.500 --> 41:02.000
-Poor man!
-Come on, doctor.

41:04.310 --> 41:08.210
Do you expect a senior doctor like me to do the squeezing?

41:12.350 --> 41:14.920
Oho, he can't even do the squeezing well.

41:14.920 --> 41:17.450
How on earth did he become a doctor?

41:20.660 --> 41:22.390
Didn't you tell me never to possess you again?

41:22.390 --> 41:24.430
I did what you said.

41:24.430 --> 41:25.430
Hey, where are you going?

41:25.430 --> 41:27.400
Seung Tak, I have something to say to you.

41:27.400 --> 41:29.530
Let's have a talk.

41:32.700 --> 41:34.400
What did you come to my room?

41:35.370 --> 41:36.940
What are you doing?

41:39.710 --> 41:41.110
Are you…

41:41.780 --> 41:43.280
Hey, not that one.

41:43.280 --> 41:46.020
I wore it only once. It's the latest design.

41:46.020 --> 41:47.180
Hey, well, about that…

41:47.180 --> 41:49.290
Well, you can't do that.

41:49.290 --> 41:50.190
The clothes are innocent.

41:50.190 --> 41:51.590
Put it down before I get angry.

41:51.590 --> 41:53.690
Be a good boy. No, don't!

41:53.690 --> 41:57.130
You brat! It's your stinky hands to blame! How dare you mess up with me!

41:57.130 --> 41:58.590
Don't, I get this!

41:58.590 --> 41:59.530
I get it.

41:59.530 --> 42:01.800
Calm down.

42:01.800 --> 42:05.030
Seung Tak, I can meet all your demands.

42:05.030 --> 42:06.400
What do you need me to do?

42:06.400 --> 42:09.770
Just say it. How about doing the squeezing one more time?

42:10.210 --> 42:13.010
No!

42:18.280 --> 42:19.720
Didn't you just let me put it down?

42:19.720 --> 42:21.520
I did what you said.

42:25.860 --> 42:27.590
Are you nuts?

42:27.590 --> 42:30.590
How childish are you to avenge this way?

42:30.590 --> 42:32.060
So what? Of course, revenge is puerile.

42:32.060 --> 42:33.500
But I'm not noble anyway.

42:33.500 --> 42:35.000
Darn it!

42:37.270 --> 42:38.700
Dr. Go.

42:46.440 --> 42:47.780
Ah?

42:47.780 --> 42:49.110
What's this?

42:49.110 --> 42:50.410
Well, why?

42:50.410 --> 42:53.780
Did someone throw it down on purpose?

42:59.820 --> 43:01.420
My size.

43:09.600 --> 43:11.830
Oh, my new clothes.

43:13.040 --> 43:15.610
I bought them from a couture shop.

43:15.610 --> 43:17.240
Darn it!

43:17.240 --> 43:20.180
Installment by credit card for six months.

43:20.180 --> 43:22.080
Darn, that brat!

43:22.080 --> 43:24.650
I even grew dark circles for them.

43:41.930 --> 43:43.270
[Cha Yeong Min]

43:53.510 --> 43:55.210
Why would you come here?

44:10.760 --> 44:11.930
Se Jin,

44:13.660 --> 44:15.260
what are you looking for?

44:40.860 --> 44:42.790
Darn!

44:48.960 --> 44:50.830
Finally.

45:35.540 --> 45:37.110
Did I hear it wrong?

46:11.850 --> 46:13.320
What are you doing?

46:14.980 --> 46:17.320
You want to see the president's records?

46:18.490 --> 46:19.960
But you don't know the password.

46:19.960 --> 46:22.930
Even if you do, it must have been blocked.

46:37.410 --> 46:40.340
Well, please don't keep coming.

46:40.340 --> 46:42.750
The patient should have meals on time.

46:45.780 --> 46:47.720
You jerk, hands off!

46:49.420 --> 46:51.720
I got it. Let me go.

46:52.720 --> 46:54.520
Please send this inside.

46:58.630 --> 47:04.470
It's really hard to offer meals to the president in person.

47:04.470 --> 47:06.600
We'll deliver it for you. Please leave.

47:06.600 --> 47:09.710
Did he eat the sauced crab I sent last time?

47:09.710 --> 47:11.170
It's the president's favorite food.

47:11.170 --> 47:13.610
Sure, the president was very happy.

47:13.610 --> 47:14.980
He ate it in satisfaction.

47:14.980 --> 47:18.110
Did he finish all of it by himself?

47:19.550 --> 47:24.420
I will deliver this for you. Please leave now.

47:24.420 --> 47:27.090
Please don't make things difficult for us.

47:27.090 --> 47:28.720
Thank you.

47:28.720 --> 47:30.860
If he wants to see me, please tell me instantly.

47:30.860 --> 47:31.930
Okay.

48:05.830 --> 48:10.970
President, it's not that I don't want to conceal your situation…

48:10.970 --> 48:14.140
Boy, do you have savings?

48:14.140 --> 48:15.000
Not many.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.140
Have you bought an apartment?

48:17.140 --> 48:17.910
Full tax...

48:17.910 --> 48:19.010
Family members?

48:19.010 --> 48:22.240
Are you from a single family with sisters or what?

48:22.240 --> 48:23.580
Only myself.

48:25.150 --> 48:27.320
Forgive my rudeness.

48:28.220 --> 48:31.320
Do you love my daughter?

48:32.150 --> 48:34.160
Why don't you answer me?

48:34.160 --> 48:36.760
Then how dare you spy on my daughter!

48:36.760 --> 48:39.560
President, it must be a misunderstanding.

48:39.560 --> 48:43.330
If you want my daughter's money,

48:43.330 --> 48:45.500
you can give up that idea now.

48:45.500 --> 48:48.470
She said she wouldn't take a penny from me.

48:48.470 --> 48:50.010
Oh, is that so?

48:51.140 --> 48:55.080
If it's okay with you, please be responsible for her.

48:55.080 --> 48:56.150
What?

48:57.450 --> 49:00.150
Se Jin knows that

49:00.150 --> 49:04.720
I'm allergic to crustaceans. No way I would eat sauced crab.

49:05.850 --> 49:08.620
It's okay that my situation is kept a secret.

49:08.620 --> 49:14.730
But don't let her come here again.

49:14.730 --> 49:17.530
She's tired enough for taking care of you.

49:17.530 --> 49:20.570
I don't want to burden her any more.

49:20.570 --> 49:22.710
I'm not a qualified father.

49:23.270 --> 49:28.010
I didn't fulfill my duties and gave her so much pain.

49:31.180 --> 49:33.480
She's been beside you all the time

49:33.480 --> 49:36.990
after you had the accident.

49:41.690 --> 49:43.190
Hello.

49:43.190 --> 49:46.960
She makes time to do ward rounds occasionally.

49:46.960 --> 49:49.630
Any symptoms of dizziness or nausea?

49:49.630 --> 49:52.600
At this point,

49:52.600 --> 49:56.340
she won't leave me alone.

49:56.340 --> 50:00.410
But if they find out...

50:01.780 --> 50:05.610
You know what I mean, right?

50:16.260 --> 50:23.930
This guy never breaks regulations. He's so honest.

50:33.780 --> 50:39.920
That thing must be what keeps me alive.

50:41.220 --> 50:46.220
Should I be grateful or angry?

50:54.460 --> 50:57.470
She's tired enough for taking care of you.

50:57.470 --> 51:00.170
I don't want to burden her any more.

51:00.170 --> 51:02.300
I'm not a qualified father.

51:12.780 --> 51:14.220
I'm sorry.

51:14.920 --> 51:17.420
Are you all right? Hello?

51:39.070 --> 51:43.080
Neither I nor the president can be saved by you alone.

51:43.080 --> 51:45.110
So, don't push yourself too hard.

51:49.750 --> 51:52.620
This is Jang Se Jin, Vice President of Administration.

51:52.620 --> 51:57.030
I want to talk with you about the president. Are you free now?

51:57.590 --> 52:01.600
But if they find out...

52:03.800 --> 52:07.670
You know what I mean, right?

52:07.670 --> 52:09.100
Se Jin, no.

52:09.100 --> 52:11.770
Here's your iced Americano.

52:11.770 --> 52:15.240
Five minutes. Let me use your body for five minutes.

52:17.150 --> 52:19.550
Go Seung Tak, is that your attitude?

52:19.550 --> 52:21.780
What can you do if I must get in?

52:21.780 --> 52:24.890
Seung Tak, come here. Go Seung Tak.

52:24.890 --> 52:26.260
Go Seung Tak!

52:27.820 --> 52:29.530
This darn shield.

52:29.530 --> 52:31.660
Seung Tak, come here for a second

52:31.660 --> 52:35.400
Let's talk, okay? Just a while.

52:37.470 --> 52:40.000
Didn't I just agree to lend you five minutes?

52:40.000 --> 52:41.100
But you ignored it.

52:41.100 --> 52:43.440
Ah, did you really mean that?

52:43.440 --> 52:47.080
I thought you didn't want to let me pass.

52:47.080 --> 52:50.350
Then don't come forever. Over.

52:50.350 --> 52:52.650
I'm sorry, Seung Tak. It's all my fault.

52:52.650 --> 52:55.380
Seung Tak, just this once. I'm begging you.

52:55.380 --> 52:58.490
Just five minutes! Go Seung Tak, just this once!

52:58.490 --> 53:01.120
You will be sorry for it. Come back.

53:01.120 --> 53:02.420
Seung Tak!

53:14.200 --> 53:16.140
I'm busy. What's the matter?

53:17.810 --> 53:20.480
Why are you so down? This is not like you.

53:25.150 --> 53:28.050
Is it because of the news?

53:28.050 --> 53:30.620
Am I a person who cares about that?

53:31.490 --> 53:33.320
But why don't you ask me?

53:33.960 --> 53:34.520
What?

53:34.520 --> 53:36.430
Yesterday's cardiac tamponade operation.

53:36.430 --> 53:37.590
You saw it, didn't you?

53:37.590 --> 53:40.000
If it's something I should know,

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
you will tell me yourself.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.600
I'm your friend.

53:47.500 --> 53:49.710
People in the ICU are confused.

53:49.710 --> 53:52.570
They thought you were a terrible doctor,

53:52.570 --> 53:54.540
but now you're a genius to them.

53:54.540 --> 53:58.310
What about you? Which one do you want me to be?

54:00.320 --> 54:02.820
No one likes a fool,

54:02.820 --> 54:06.220
not to mention a clumsy doctor.

54:06.220 --> 54:10.430
But I don't want you to be too tired.

54:12.160 --> 54:13.800
Just follow your heart.

54:13.800 --> 54:16.400
Let's hope for the best.

54:20.370 --> 54:22.440
Thank you for your advice.

54:25.240 --> 54:27.710
Hello, brother. What's wrong?

54:30.750 --> 54:33.020
Why didn't he drink the coffee at all?

54:36.050 --> 54:38.290
If you don't mind, please drink it.

54:39.350 --> 54:40.760
Ah, thank you.

54:40.760 --> 54:41.960
I happen to be thirsty.

54:41.960 --> 54:43.630
Great.

54:46.460 --> 54:48.960
Why are things so harmonious between you two today?

54:48.960 --> 54:51.130
You always hit him before.

54:51.670 --> 54:52.400
What?

54:53.040 --> 54:57.240
Well, it's a habit from school days.

54:57.810 --> 54:58.740
Why is that?

54:58.740 --> 55:03.810
Did Dr. Go do anything wrong to our Dr. Pretty?

55:05.780 --> 55:07.780
[Emergency Medical Center]

55:06.250 --> 55:08.080
He owes me.

55:08.080 --> 55:09.890
A great debt.

55:15.020 --> 55:19.960
I get angry at the sight of him.

55:21.800 --> 55:23.300
Enjoy your coffee.

55:24.030 --> 55:28.700
Dr. Go indeed often says things that piss others off.

55:28.700 --> 55:31.610
But he's not a bad person.

55:31.610 --> 55:35.310
As an elderly person, I'm good at telling a person's quality.

55:36.010 --> 55:37.410
Thank you.

55:46.620 --> 55:48.520
But you are not very old.

55:57.700 --> 56:01.100
What… What's this?

56:04.710 --> 56:09.080
Bed 37, neurosurgery, blue alarm.

56:11.210 --> 56:14.450
Oh, that ungrateful kid! Can't he be a little helpful?

56:17.350 --> 56:18.350
The doctor will arrive soon.

56:18.350 --> 56:20.360
Cardiac arrest. Do CPR and raise the blue alarm.

56:20.360 --> 56:21.390
Yes.

56:28.600 --> 56:32.330
Well, am I able to treat a patient that seriously ill?

56:32.330 --> 56:34.540
Do what you did before.

56:37.210 --> 56:38.610
Didn't you see it just now?

56:38.610 --> 56:40.510
The ghost has left.

56:41.110 --> 56:42.680
Don't call me any more.

56:42.680 --> 56:43.880
Are you clear?

56:49.850 --> 56:51.420
One's constitution decides his work.

56:51.420 --> 56:53.820
To play corresponds with mine.

56:53.820 --> 56:55.520
Was the bed changed?

56:58.030 --> 57:01.500
Yesterday he was a surgeon and today he's Go Seung Tak again.

57:03.800 --> 57:06.540

57:06.540 --> 57:07.600
What?

57:13.480 --> 57:14.940
You scared me.

57:15.810 --> 57:17.780
Hey, little patient.

57:17.780 --> 57:19.820
Are you playing hide and seek again?

57:21.080 --> 57:23.720
I've told you that it's not enough to just hide your head.

57:23.720 --> 57:27.860
Besides, your mom can't find you if you hide in places like this.

57:27.860 --> 57:30.590
Get up. Your mom will get worried.

57:34.600 --> 57:36.500
Doctor.

Doctor.

57:55.780 --> 57:56.790
What happened?

57:56.790 --> 57:58.620
The patient is having a cardiac arrest.

58:01.590 --> 58:03.690
One milliliter of adrenaline. Be quick.

Doctor, you made me become like this.

Electric shock!

59:47.430 --> 59:49.330
Hasn't your grandpa changed his mind yet?

59:49.330 --> 59:51.330
It's a pity to waste my ability.

59:51.330 --> 59:54.740
It will be hard. The family's struggle for power can be very cruel.

59:54.740 --> 59:57.010
Your things must be urgent so that you have to possess me.

59:57.010 --> 59:59.110
Well, I'm a doctor.

59:59.110 --> 1:00:01.110
I will die anyway, no matter I possess you or not.

Compared with an idiot with no hands-on ability,

1:00:02.610 --> 1:00:04.210
a genius is better.

1:00:04.210 --> 1:00:07.920
But I can't die like this,

1:00:07.920 --> 1:00:09.220
for I feel angry about many things.

1:00:09.220 --> 1:00:12.590
In my heart, I also don't want to see others die.

1:00:13.760 --> 1:00:14.460
Let's cooperate.

1:00:14.460 --> 1:00:16.020
Okay, good.

When you need to possess me, you must check the situation first.

-If I do this…
-Am I a dog?

1:01:01.370 --> 1:01:03.710
Miss, you can't do this here.

1:01:04.610 --> 1:01:06.710
Are you the doctor who saved that boy?

1:01:06.710 --> 1:01:08.710
Who broke the rules first?

1:01:08.710 --> 1:01:11.410
Even the professors can't do it, can you?

1:01:11.410 --> 1:01:13.980
-Let's solve it once for all now that we've opened it.
-Oh my God!

1:01:13.980 --> 1:01:15.750
We are walking side by side now?

1:01:15.750 --> 1:01:17.390
Are you afraid that others know that you can see ghosts?

1:01:17.390 --> 1:01:20.720
Why don't you disclose the secret you know, Dr. Go?

1:01:20.290 --> 1:01:20.960
[Operating Room]

1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:22.760
Where is that guy? What's he doing?

1:01:21.560 --> 1:01:22.190
[EunSang University Medical Center]

1:01:22.760 --> 1:01:23.560
Can you hear me,

1:01:23.560 --> 1:01:24.690
