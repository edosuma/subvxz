00:33.133 --> 00:34.500
I didn't miss anything, did I?

00:34.501 --> 00:35.741
No, no, no, you didn't miss it.

00:35.765 --> 00:37.269
I was just about to begin in.

00:37.270 --> 00:40.973
Gentlemen, I want to remind you
of a very special someone‐‐

00:40.974 --> 00:43.609
baseball legend Wade
Boggs‐‐ ‐Great.

00:43.610 --> 00:47.479
‐‐who is rumored to have
drank 64 Miller Lites

00:47.480 --> 00:50.115
on a cross‐country flight.

00:50.116 --> 00:52.885
Now, I'm not saying we
have to match that.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.688
But it's good to have goals!

00:55.488 --> 00:56.889
It's good to have goals.

00:56.890 --> 00:57.691
I like that.

00:57.692 --> 00:58.692
I wrote that.

00:58.693 --> 00:59.959
I wrote that and memorized it.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.127
God, I didn't think you were
going to make it, dude.

01:02.128 --> 01:03.488
Barrett said you're
way too whipped

01:03.489 --> 01:04.790
by Katherine to do a pub crawl.

01:04.791 --> 01:06.065
Don't misquote me, man.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.399
I didn't say that.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.600
I said, he's way too scared
of Katherine to blow her up.

01:09.624 --> 01:13.405
Come on, there's no way I would
miss as a new tradition, right?

01:13.406 --> 01:15.407
I'm just going to be
responsible a little bit.

01:15.408 --> 01:16.928
I'm gonna do three
bars, and that's it.

01:16.952 --> 01:18.077
- What?
- Three bars?

01:18.078 --> 01:18.879
Three bars?

01:18.880 --> 01:20.279
Three bars.

01:20.280 --> 01:21.947
Oh, I mean, there's no point
of you even being here.

01:21.948 --> 01:23.382
I mean, you should
just go home now,

01:23.383 --> 01:25.985
man, because you're going
to miss all the good shit.

01:25.986 --> 01:26.820
He wrote a speech.

01:26.821 --> 01:28.220
Okay, I understand.

01:28.221 --> 01:29.722
But, dude, Katherine's parents
are visiting from out of town,

01:29.723 --> 01:30.756
and I got to hang out.

01:30.757 --> 01:31.991
If I skipped out,
then she'll kill me.

01:31.992 --> 01:33.158
Hey, guys, guys, guys,
guys, check this out.

01:33.159 --> 01:34.259
I know we said we
were just going

01:34.260 --> 01:35.460
to do beer at the first bar.

01:35.461 --> 01:37.262
But there was this
super‐hot shot girl.

01:37.263 --> 01:39.164
She freaking was so hot.

01:39.165 --> 01:41.125
Do I have to teach your
little brother everything?

01:41.149 --> 01:42.735
Never ever talk to
the shot girls.

01:42.736 --> 01:43.704
Never.

01:43.705 --> 01:45.404
They're just
undercover bartenders.

01:45.405 --> 01:46.507
And they never put up.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.943
'Cept that one might
be different.

01:50.944 --> 01:51.878
Excuse me, boys.

01:51.879 --> 01:53.112
Oh.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.114
I'm not even trying to hook
up with that girl, man.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.616
I‐‐ I actually really
want to see how

01:56.617 --> 01:57.950
things work with me and Amanda.

01:57.951 --> 01:58.951
Aw, that's sweet.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.052
Amanda?

02:00.053 --> 02:01.653
Are you talking about
Katherine's friend?

02:01.677 --> 02:02.387
Yeah.

02:02.388 --> 02:03.388
You've been out on
one date with her.

02:03.389 --> 02:04.749
‐Yeah, but she's really cool.
‐Zzh!

02:04.750 --> 02:05.910
Beer pong's up. David, you in?

02:05.934 --> 02:06.527
All right.

02:06.528 --> 02:09.228
Oh, Adam and I got next.

02:09.229 --> 02:10.630
Come here.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.998
I gotta say, man, that rousing
speech was awesome, man.

02:12.999 --> 02:14.534
You got our song‐playing dude.

02:14.535 --> 02:16.936
This is not gonna be‐‐
not gonna be easy.

02:16.937 --> 02:19.639
Buddy, that is just
the beginning.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.206
Check it out.

02:21.207 --> 02:22.207
What the hell is that?

02:22.208 --> 02:25.044
That, my friend, is a barcycle.

02:25.045 --> 02:26.478
Barcycle!

02:26.479 --> 02:29.314
Let's be stupid people, man!

02:29.315 --> 02:30.850
Heh.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.052
Three bars, huh?

02:36.290 --> 02:37.290
This is so weird.

02:37.291 --> 02:38.658
He just texted me.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.019
You know, I'm gonna
call him again.

02:40.043 --> 02:42.011
Okay.

02:49.335 --> 02:51.804
Oh, man, I'm so drunk, man.

02:51.805 --> 02:54.807
Barcycle was a bad idea.

02:54.808 --> 02:56.175
I really got to go.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.178
I'll be right back.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.513
Hey, what's up, babe?

03:00.514 --> 03:03.749
Oh, my god, you look so
good in a black dress.

03:03.750 --> 03:05.117
What the fuck?

03:05.118 --> 03:07.987
Oh, my god, you look
so good tonight.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.354
You're like a doll.

03:09.355 --> 03:10.190
What are you doing?

03:10.191 --> 03:11.256
What's up?

03:11.257 --> 03:12.992
Oh, my god, I'm so
sorry I'm late, ha‐ha.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.960
Adam, why did you get so drunk?

03:14.961 --> 03:15.762
What?

03:15.763 --> 03:16.996
Oh, my god.

03:16.997 --> 03:20.165
Um, I‐‐ I'm not that drunk,
but I was responsible.

03:20.166 --> 03:22.935
And I only drank nine
beers before flip cup.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.103
How many shots did you have?

03:24.104 --> 03:25.204
Shots don't count.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.106
Everybody knows that
shots don't count.

03:27.107 --> 03:28.841
All right, look, I confess.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.042
I'm a little bit drunk.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.011
But you know what?

03:31.012 --> 03:32.612
The guys decided
that we were going

03:32.613 --> 03:36.081
to have, uh, every year
to do a pub crawl,

03:36.082 --> 03:37.382
because it's our anniversary.

03:37.383 --> 03:39.652
Adam, do you even know
when our anniversary is?

03:39.653 --> 03:41.921
Yeah, totally, I
know when it is.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.356
Every single year.

03:44.457 --> 03:48.493
It's not today, is it?

03:48.494 --> 03:49.329
Oh, shit.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.030
It's today?

03:51.031 --> 03:54.433
What did you get me?

03:54.434 --> 03:55.835
Go be with your friends.

03:55.836 --> 03:56.670
No way.

03:56.671 --> 03:58.070
I would never do that with them.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.906
Why would you‐‐ I know how
important this day is to you.

04:00.907 --> 04:01.941
Why is Mook naked?

04:01.942 --> 04:03.042
Mook's naked.

04:03.043 --> 04:05.477
That's because that's
how we party, dude!

04:05.478 --> 04:06.279
Adam.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.913
What?

04:07.914 --> 04:09.381
Go be with your friends.

04:09.382 --> 04:11.684
Oh, my god, I love you
so much, Katherine.

04:11.685 --> 04:13.152
Thank you, I know.

04:13.153 --> 04:16.789
You guys, thanks so
much for you know what.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.825
Yeah, Mr. Dad and the mom.

04:19.826 --> 04:21.026
Hey, guys!

04:21.027 --> 04:22.907
Katherine said I could
stay out a little longer.

04:25.832 --> 04:29.670
Hey, Katherine, can you
please tell Amanda call me?

05:50.050 --> 05:51.483
So what are we doing here?

05:51.484 --> 05:52.652
David said we had to come.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.587
Oh, it's a party for Amanda.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.021
He's so whipped.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.624
He picked a bad week,
but your little brother

05:58.625 --> 06:00.359
did go all out, I'll say that.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.227
Definitely.

06:01.228 --> 06:02.461
This place, man.

06:02.462 --> 06:03.663
Wow, man.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.144
I really need to get
my shit together.

06:05.168 --> 06:06.331
Oh, man.

06:06.332 --> 06:08.534
If I was making real
estate money like David,

06:08.535 --> 06:10.175
I wouldn't waste it on
these wine parties.

06:10.199 --> 06:10.904
Oh!

06:10.905 --> 06:12.237
Oh, oh.

06:12.238 --> 06:13.039
What?

06:13.040 --> 06:14.707
What up with that one?

06:14.708 --> 06:16.275
That's my 16‐year‐old cousin.

06:16.276 --> 06:19.178
So no because she's your cousin?

06:19.179 --> 06:21.480
Or no because she's 16?

06:21.481 --> 06:23.082
No, because of‐‐ really?

06:23.083 --> 06:23.850
Yeah.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.084
Hey, Adam.

06:25.085 --> 06:25.886
Come here.

06:25.887 --> 06:27.720
I could use your help.

06:27.721 --> 06:28.754
My mom's calling me.

06:28.755 --> 06:30.195
And no, you can't
fuck my mom either.

06:30.219 --> 06:30.890
How's that?

06:30.891 --> 06:32.371
No to my whole family.
‐Don't want to.

06:32.395 --> 06:33.325
Yeah, yeah.

06:33.326 --> 06:34.493
Don't want to.

06:34.494 --> 06:36.095
I wan to fuck his mom so bad.

06:36.096 --> 06:36.963
I know you do. I know.

06:36.963 --> 06:37.764
Hey.

06:37.765 --> 06:38.898
Hey.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.619
I can't believe David
put you to work today.

06:40.643 --> 06:42.101
I volunteered.

06:42.102 --> 06:44.136
What is that on your face?

06:44.137 --> 06:46.171
Why are you wearing it to
your brother's big party?

06:46.172 --> 06:47.472
Because I have to.

06:47.473 --> 06:49.609
It's for Fu Man Choose Your
Own Adventure, all right?

06:49.610 --> 06:51.276
If you want to play, we got
a bunch of extra ones.

06:51.277 --> 06:52.997
Mook can't grow facial
hair, so we need 'em.

06:53.021 --> 06:53.647
Yeah, right.

06:53.648 --> 06:56.549
I'll pass.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.350
Oh, aren't they adorable?

06:58.351 --> 07:00.052
Look how happy they are.

07:00.053 --> 07:00.987
Aw.

07:00.988 --> 07:02.522
When are you gonna find someone?

07:02.523 --> 07:03.289
Me?

07:03.289 --> 07:04.090
Uh, heh.

07:04.090 --> 07:04.891
I don't know.

07:04.892 --> 07:05.991
Not anytime soon.

07:05.992 --> 07:07.632
I don't want to, like,
miss out on things.

07:07.656 --> 07:08.561
Things? What things?

07:08.562 --> 07:09.862
Go, go. Yeah, yeah, I got it.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.103
I got it. ‐Relax your esophagus.

07:11.127 --> 07:12.197
Relax your esophagus.

07:12.198 --> 07:12.999
Relax.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.600
Relax. Relax.

07:14.601 --> 07:15.468
Go, go, go.

07:15.469 --> 07:16.469
More, more, more.

07:16.470 --> 07:17.837
Stuff like that, kind of.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.271
Not that, really.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.873
Not drinking from
the ass of a goose.

07:20.874 --> 07:23.408
You know, even I am
dating somebody now.

07:23.409 --> 07:24.677
Oh, no, I know.

07:24.678 --> 07:28.080
The point is, I‐‐
I‐‐ I'm very happy.

07:28.081 --> 07:31.316
And I want you to be happy too.

07:31.317 --> 07:34.386
David said that Katherine
is coming tonight.

07:34.387 --> 07:37.289
And she RSVPed plus one.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.724
Oh, cool. Katherine's coming?

07:38.725 --> 07:39.859
That's great, yeah.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.927
Uh, she‐‐ yeah, she's
coming with somebody,

07:41.928 --> 07:43.829
'cause she's over it,
and I'm over it.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.197
And we're both over it.

07:45.198 --> 07:47.967
So that's‐‐ that's‐‐ I mean,
that's‐‐ that's great.

07:47.968 --> 07:48.968
No problem here.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.040
Holy shit.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.140
Hey, man.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.909
Uh, we have a bit‐‐
little bit of a problem.

07:56.910 --> 07:57.878
Where are the guys?

07:57.879 --> 07:59.244
The guys.

07:59.245 --> 08:01.046
The guys are definitely not out
flirting with your cousin,

08:01.047 --> 08:01.782
I know that. Why?

08:01.782 --> 08:02.583
What's up?

08:02.584 --> 08:03.949
Man, uh, okay.

08:03.950 --> 08:05.384
Well, Katherine's
on her way here.

08:05.385 --> 08:06.319
And you know what?

08:06.320 --> 08:07.720
She's bringing a date. So great.

08:07.721 --> 08:08.754
Good.

08:08.755 --> 08:10.222
Hey, Katherine, the
one that got away.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.157
Yeah, you actually don't have
to say that every time I‐‐

08:12.158 --> 08:12.993
I bring her‐‐ her up.

08:12.994 --> 08:14.026
It's really annoying.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.528
You get so pissed off
every time, man.

08:15.529 --> 08:16.762
Okay Well, you know what?

08:16.763 --> 08:17.897
It's not that funny.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.031
If it happened to you,
it wouldn't be funny.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.099
It would never happen
to me, because I've

08:20.100 --> 08:21.166
never been broken up with.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.536
Look, you're stressing
out over nothing.

08:23.537 --> 08:25.571
She is probably
dating some dork.

08:25.572 --> 08:26.939
I know this. ‐Okay, but‐‐

08:26.940 --> 08:28.641
‐Oh, my god, she just walked in.
‐Where?

08:28.642 --> 08:29.576
Oh, shit.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.011
This is my boyfriend, Mario.

08:33.413 --> 08:35.414
You don't have to say it.

08:35.414 --> 08:37.717
I know I don't have
to, but I have to.

08:37.717 --> 08:40.052
Your ex‐girlfriend
is dating AC Slater!

08:40.053 --> 08:42.020
Oh, my god!

08:42.022 --> 08:43.022
Yeah, I know, dude.

08:43.023 --> 08:43.789
Okay?

08:43.791 --> 08:44.857
Oh, hey, Katherine!

08:44.858 --> 08:45.626
No, what are you doing?
Shut the fuck up.

08:45.627 --> 08:46.726
Hey.

08:46.727 --> 08:47.860
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

08:47.861 --> 08:48.961
This is, like, the
greatest day of our lives!

08:48.962 --> 08:50.442
No, it's a shitty day
of my life, man.

08:50.466 --> 08:51.363
You're being selfish.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.598
‐How am I being selfish?
‐Just get it together.

08:52.599 --> 08:53.399
Hey, guys.

08:53.399 --> 08:54.334
Hi.

08:54.335 --> 08:55.335
Mario, this is Adam.

08:55.335 --> 08:56.136
Hey.

08:56.137 --> 08:57.302
Hey, how are you?

08:57.303 --> 08:58.370
‐Barrett. ‐Yeah.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.639
‐Big fan. ‐Oh.

08:59.640 --> 09:00.574
Huge fan.

09:00.575 --> 09:01.855
And not of the hosting bullshit.

09:01.879 --> 09:03.442
But you know.

09:03.443 --> 09:04.377
You know.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.178
Yeah, yeah, I can
probably guess.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.280
"Saved by the Bell."

09:08.115 --> 09:09.115
That's it, man.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.349
Oh.

09:10.350 --> 09:13.185
I like the, uh‐‐ the‐‐ that
you got going on there.

09:13.186 --> 09:14.486
Oh, heh. Uh, yeah.

09:14.487 --> 09:15.521
Oh, it's not real.

09:15.522 --> 09:16.656
I‐‐ I didn't get the memo.

09:16.657 --> 09:17.857
I'm sorry.

09:17.858 --> 09:19.859
Yeah, no, it's just
something we do every year.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.940
It's called Fu Man‐‐ BOTH:
Choose Your Own Adventure.

09:21.964 --> 09:22.862
Yeah.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.823
I can't believe it's that
time of year again, huh?

09:24.847 --> 09:26.265
I‐‐ I‐‐ I can't believe it.

09:26.266 --> 09:27.867
Hey, maybe next year
you could join us.

09:27.868 --> 09:28.669
Yeah. Well, that's
the whole thing.

09:28.669 --> 09:29.570
But yeah. I mean, maybe.

09:29.571 --> 09:31.136
But‐‐ ‐He could totally join us.

09:31.137 --> 09:32.617
Yeah, I know, but I'm
talking about‐‐.

09:32.641 --> 09:33.706
Maybe. Heh.

09:33.707 --> 09:34.907
Uh, excuse me, guys.

09:34.908 --> 09:35.941
I gotta use the restroom.

09:35.942 --> 09:37.462
Honey, Okay, I'll‐‐
I'll be right back.

09:37.486 --> 09:38.644
‐Okay ‐Oh, that's so crazy.

09:38.645 --> 09:39.546
I have to go too.

09:39.546 --> 09:40.480
'K.

09:40.481 --> 09:41.761
I'll try to sneak
a peek for you.

09:41.785 --> 09:42.582
Don't do that.

09:42.583 --> 09:43.883
Hey.

09:43.884 --> 09:46.085
Hey There.

09:46.086 --> 09:46.887
How is everything?

09:46.888 --> 09:48.120
Really good.

09:48.121 --> 09:50.121
God, it's so funny you
asked, 'cause, uh, just, uh,

09:50.145 --> 09:51.323
been doing good stuff.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.391
Yeah, wow.

09:52.392 --> 09:53.458
I can't believe you're
dating AC Slater.

09:53.459 --> 09:54.427
That's crazy.

09:54.428 --> 09:55.460
Well, actually, his
name is Mario‐‐

09:55.461 --> 09:56.296
Albert Clifford Slater.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.097
No, I know his name.

09:57.098 --> 09:58.197
Heh‐heh.

09:58.198 --> 09:59.838
It's so weird because
a few years ago, uh,

09:59.862 --> 10:01.262
we were just on your
couch watching.

10:01.286 --> 10:02.568
"Saved by the Bell" reruns.

10:02.569 --> 10:04.729
And now, I just can't believe
Slater's been inside you,

10:04.753 --> 10:05.705
you know?

10:05.706 --> 10:07.873
It's like‐‐ uh, but
what are the odds, huh?

10:07.874 --> 10:09.543
I‐‐ I really don't
know the odds to that.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.045
Everybody, can I
have your attention

10:13.046 --> 10:14.547
for one second, please?

10:14.548 --> 10:18.050
I think it's time we should
toast my beautiful girlfriend,

10:18.051 --> 10:19.251
Amanda.

10:19.252 --> 10:23.556
She‐‐ she passed the bar
today and is officially

10:23.557 --> 10:25.190
a bloodsucking lawyer.

10:25.191 --> 10:27.893
Hear, hear.

10:27.894 --> 10:30.896
I just want to say,
in all seriousness,

10:30.897 --> 10:35.234
that I'm so proud of you, hon.

10:35.235 --> 10:40.272
And I'm proud of who I've
become since knowing you.

10:40.273 --> 10:43.876
I know that I could spend the
rest of my life with you.

10:43.877 --> 10:44.877
So, um‐‐

10:48.915 --> 10:50.951
Amanda will you marry me?

10:55.722 --> 10:56.722
Yes!

10:56.723 --> 10:58.358
Oh, my god, yes!

11:02.996 --> 11:06.667
Who's ready for Fu Man
Choose Your Own Adventure?

11:13.473 --> 11:16.076
Are we not playing today?

11:18.278 --> 11:20.346
Guys could've sent an
email or something.

11:24.284 --> 11:25.284
Awesome.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.605
Nice boobs.

11:52.313 --> 11:53.313
Morning.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.114
Hey.

11:54.115 --> 11:55.347
Hey.

11:55.348 --> 11:57.517
I just saw a couple of
unsatisfied women out there.

11:57.518 --> 11:58.818
Who disappointed
them last night?

11:58.819 --> 12:01.721
Uh, I think maybe they're
disappointed in themselves.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.422
This place, uh,
looks disgusting.

12:03.423 --> 12:07.059
I'm glad you guys cleaned
up for the draft.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.761
Hey, guys, how's it going?

12:08.762 --> 12:09.795
How are you doing, David?

12:09.796 --> 12:10.796
Good morning.

12:11.665 --> 12:13.533
Uh, quick question.

12:13.534 --> 12:18.404
Who was texting Casey last
night posing as my angry wife?

12:19.940 --> 12:21.900
Let me explain to you
something about Casey, okay?

12:21.924 --> 12:23.408
She is very young.

12:23.409 --> 12:24.810
She's impressionable.

12:24.811 --> 12:27.046
She believed I was
a state senator.

12:27.047 --> 12:27.848
Why?

12:27.849 --> 12:29.148
Because I have a beard.

12:29.149 --> 12:31.350
Now, who did it?

12:31.351 --> 12:32.685
No one?

12:32.686 --> 12:33.719
Okay, wow.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.054
Guess what.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.088
Vengeance will be mine.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.657
Are you guys still
declaring vengeance?

12:37.658 --> 12:38.592
What is that?

12:38.593 --> 12:39.860
Are you guys, like, 15?

12:40.861 --> 12:41.861
Hey.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.302
What the fuck happened
to this place?

12:43.326 --> 12:44.764
Pussypop!

12:44.765 --> 12:45.798
Pussypop!

12:45.799 --> 12:47.600
Hey, I'm a grown‐ass
man with a family.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.369
Y'all gotta stop calling
me Pussypop, man.

12:49.971 --> 12:50.971
Hey, baby.

12:50.971 --> 12:51.905
What's up, buttercup?

12:51.906 --> 12:53.238
Oh, buttercup‐‐
that's a new one.

12:53.239 --> 12:55.074
Buttercup, I love you.

12:55.075 --> 12:56.942
You guys haven't
changed one bit.

12:56.943 --> 12:57.744
Thank you.

12:57.745 --> 12:59.044
Not a compliment.

12:59.045 --> 12:59.880
Oh, shit.

12:59.881 --> 13:01.180
What's going on?

13:01.181 --> 13:01.982
Barrett.

13:01.983 --> 13:03.048
It's cool.

13:03.049 --> 13:05.117
That's why we got the
backup generator.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.886
"This is why we got a
backup generator."

13:06.887 --> 13:08.854
They usually send a
final warning first.

13:08.855 --> 13:10.122
They do.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.323
All right, it's gonna be okay.

13:11.347 --> 13:12.491
Just don't‐‐ I love you.

13:12.492 --> 13:13.459
Okay.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.594
How's the wife, David?

13:14.595 --> 13:15.961
Don't say "wife."

13:15.962 --> 13:18.130
We haven't been to
his funeral yet.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.765
Sorry, Pussypop.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.901
Please stop acting like
my wedding was a funeral.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.135
Miss you, Pussypop.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.236
This is for you, home.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.237
I'm alive!

13:29.577 --> 13:30.577
Morning, dude.

13:30.577 --> 13:31.577
Morning.

13:37.919 --> 13:38.919
Good morning, sunshine.

13:38.919 --> 13:39.720
Hey.

13:39.721 --> 13:41.386
You feel out your baggy yet?

13:41.387 --> 13:42.787
What the hell are
you talking about?

13:42.811 --> 13:44.489
Mm.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.559
Check your email, shemale.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.000
Howie made a March
Madness tournament

13:48.024 --> 13:50.029
of all the hot chicks
Mario Lopez has fucked.

13:50.030 --> 13:52.732
Katherine is up against the
Victoria's Secret model

13:52.733 --> 13:53.866
in the first round.

13:53.867 --> 13:54.768
She's a two‐seed.

13:54.769 --> 13:55.868
Congrats, baby.

13:55.869 --> 13:57.937
Does Howie ever actually
do any work at work?

13:57.938 --> 13:59.338
Never.

13:59.339 --> 14:03.609
Oh, we also just got the Evite
for Miles' big Halloween party.

14:03.610 --> 14:04.910
What are we gonna be this year?

14:04.911 --> 14:06.846
Uh, you know, I'm‐‐ I don't want

14:06.847 --> 14:08.480
to do a group costume again.

14:08.481 --> 14:09.715
Nah.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.084
We'll think of something cool.

14:15.890 --> 14:16.890
Morning, Adam.

14:16.890 --> 14:17.824
Hey, Mook.

14:17.824 --> 14:18.659
Hey.

14:18.660 --> 14:20.025
Are you guys going to be long?

14:20.026 --> 14:21.586
Yeah, might be a few minutes.
Go for it.

14:21.610 --> 14:22.610
Oh, thanks.

14:26.633 --> 14:30.069
"Adam's Fantasy
Midseason Report Card?"

14:30.070 --> 14:31.436
Very work‐related, I'm sure.

14:31.437 --> 14:32.917
Well, it helps me get
through the day,

14:32.918 --> 14:34.478
so it's got to count
for something, huh?

14:34.502 --> 14:35.208
Hey, Beth.

14:35.209 --> 14:36.609
You going to Lyle's
Halloween party?

14:36.633 --> 14:37.710
Guess that depends.

14:37.711 --> 14:40.613
Are you guys going dressed
as the Spice Girls again?

14:40.614 --> 14:43.015
Oh, for the record, I
immediately regretted that.

14:43.016 --> 14:44.383
I didn't regret shit.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.119
I'm Scary Spice
till I D‐I‐E, dawg.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.320
Oh, god.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.281
Um, are you gonna shave
your legs again this year?

14:50.305 --> 14:51.425
Oh, well, not for Halloween.

14:54.028 --> 14:55.108
All right, I'm out of here.

14:55.132 --> 14:55.829
Thank you.

14:55.830 --> 14:57.062
Yeah.

14:57.063 --> 15:00.566
Sorry you have to think
about my legs right now.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.235
Apology unaccepted.

15:03.236 --> 15:07.406
So we are just openly
hitting on Beth now?

15:07.407 --> 15:08.527
No, I'm just messing around.

15:08.528 --> 15:10.208
Come on, she always has
a boyfriend anyway.

15:10.232 --> 15:11.577
Never stopped me
before, big dog.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.612
Up top.

15:12.613 --> 15:14.093
I don't‐‐ I'm not
gonna high‐five you.

15:14.117 --> 15:15.048
Little pinkie?

15:15.049 --> 15:16.449
- Okay, fine, there.
- There you go.

15:16.450 --> 15:17.684
There you go. ‐Good, you happy?

15:17.685 --> 15:18.351
Mm‐hmm.

15:18.352 --> 15:19.712
Adam, I was just
calling your desk.

15:19.713 --> 15:20.713
I have a package for you.

15:20.714 --> 15:23.689
Oh, cool.

15:23.690 --> 15:24.724
So how was your weekend?

15:24.725 --> 15:25.758
It was great.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.793
I tried pineapple
for the first time.

15:27.794 --> 15:29.194
So I've been wanting
to talk to you.

15:29.195 --> 15:31.035
One of my friends from
college just moved here,

15:31.059 --> 15:32.632
and she doesn't know anybody.

15:32.633 --> 15:34.767
And so I was worrying if
any guys I worked with‐‐.

15:34.768 --> 15:35.602
Wait, okay.

15:35.603 --> 15:37.269
What does she do for a living?

15:37.270 --> 15:38.638
She may be an actress.

15:38.639 --> 15:39.573
Okay, no.

15:39.573 --> 15:40.541
We've been over this before.

15:40.542 --> 15:41.641
Come on.

15:41.642 --> 15:43.308
I know, but I really
think you'd like her.

15:43.309 --> 15:45.309
I mean, I know you're super
begin into Asian girls,

15:45.333 --> 15:46.411
but she's really pretty.

15:46.412 --> 15:47.947
Wait, why do you think I'm
big into Asian girls?

15:47.948 --> 15:49.915
Well, Mook showed me a
picture of your ex.

15:49.916 --> 15:52.251
She's gorgeous‐‐ definitely
final four potential.

15:52.252 --> 15:53.053
Yes.

15:53.054 --> 15:54.086
Really?

15:54.087 --> 15:55.855
All right, let me
help you with this.

15:55.856 --> 15:56.657
Look at that thing.

15:56.658 --> 15:59.058
Who's it from?

15:59.059 --> 16:00.392
Says it's from you.

16:00.393 --> 16:01.261
Oh, no, no, no wait!

16:01.262 --> 16:03.428
Whoa, shit.

16:03.429 --> 16:04.429
Sorry.

16:04.430 --> 16:06.231
My roommate is declaring
vengeance on us.

16:06.232 --> 16:09.334
Jamie, called to‐‐ oh.

16:09.335 --> 16:10.236
Hey.

16:10.237 --> 16:12.071
What is that?

16:12.072 --> 16:14.006
Is that for me or‐‐.

16:14.007 --> 16:16.742
No, it's, uh, for me.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.343
Or, I mean, it could
be‐‐ if you want it.

16:18.367 --> 16:19.579
You don't want it.

16:19.580 --> 16:20.680
‐No, I don't want it. ‐Of
course you don't want it.

16:20.681 --> 16:21.481
Um‐‐.

16:21.482 --> 16:22.602
What is wrong with you guys?

16:22.626 --> 16:23.249
Seriously.

16:23.249 --> 16:24.117
What's your name?

16:24.118 --> 16:25.217
Mook.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.458
Mook, I'd expect this from you.

16:26.482 --> 16:28.287
But you, Aaron?

16:28.288 --> 16:29.122
Adam.

16:29.122 --> 16:29.923
Adam?

16:29.924 --> 16:31.090
You think that matters?

16:31.091 --> 16:33.258
You're holding a‐‐
a vase of dicks.

16:33.259 --> 16:34.459
Point taken.

16:34.460 --> 16:35.395
Come on!

16:35.396 --> 16:37.462
It's a national lacrosse league.

16:37.463 --> 16:39.331
This is disappointing.

16:39.332 --> 16:41.266
Put those dicks somewhere.

16:41.267 --> 16:43.368
Can he say‐‐ he'd
say that to us.

16:43.369 --> 16:44.504
I'll take care of it.

16:44.505 --> 16:46.305
I‐‐ you guys shouldn't
have to deal with this.

16:46.329 --> 16:48.131
I have a‐‐ I have
a place for them.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.630
Sorry. ‐lt's really
inappropriate.

16:51.654 --> 16:52.654
All right.

16:57.651 --> 17:01.086
You smell so good.

17:01.087 --> 17:02.788
You guys thirsty?

17:02.789 --> 17:03.789
Hmm?

17:07.861 --> 17:11.030
Everybody, I need your attention
up here to the stage.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.665
Everyone, look at me.

17:12.665 --> 17:13.499
All right!

17:13.500 --> 17:15.268
How much do we love Halloween?

17:16.737 --> 17:18.671
All right!

17:18.672 --> 17:23.076
And the winner is
the Ghostbusters!

17:29.415 --> 17:30.415
Hey.

17:30.416 --> 17:31.551
Hey, how are you?

17:31.552 --> 17:33.218
You guys were
robbed, by the way.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.419
I know, yeah.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.455
What made you guys decide
to be a group of turds?

17:36.456 --> 17:38.216
Well, we were supposed
to California Raisins,

17:38.217 --> 17:39.018
and you know that.

17:39.019 --> 17:40.059
Yeah, I know.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.193
That's actually pretty cool.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.914
I haven't had a group
costume since college.

17:42.938 --> 17:43.938
Smile.

17:47.200 --> 17:50.803
Uh, cat and cat shit?

17:50.804 --> 17:52.364
I guess you can't say
that anymore, huh?

17:52.388 --> 17:53.673
Guess not.

17:53.674 --> 17:54.674
Hey.

17:54.675 --> 17:55.675
Oh, hey!

17:55.676 --> 17:56.476
Hey.

17:56.477 --> 17:58.010
Hey, you made it.

17:58.011 --> 17:59.278
Um, Justin, Adam.

17:59.279 --> 18:00.080
Adam, Justin.

18:00.081 --> 18:01.081
I‐‐ I work with Adam.

18:01.081 --> 18:01.982
Oh. Hey, Adam.

18:01.982 --> 18:02.783
Hey.

18:02.783 --> 18:03.717
It's nice to meet you.

18:03.718 --> 18:05.150
Yeah, nice to meet you too, man.

18:05.151 --> 18:06.251
Uh, what'd you come as?

18:06.252 --> 18:07.352
Oh, uh‐‐.

18:07.353 --> 18:08.953
Oh, he just‐‐ he came
straight from work.

18:08.977 --> 18:09.889
Hey, you look thirsty.

18:09.890 --> 18:10.956
What are you drinking?

18:10.957 --> 18:11.858
Uh, I don't know.

18:11.859 --> 18:13.019
Let's get this party started.

18:13.043 --> 18:14.243
We'll do some Jagerbombs, huh?

18:15.862 --> 18:16.929
Jagerbombs.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.230
All right, you're
really taking me back.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.751
I mean, while we're
at it, why don't we

18:19.775 --> 18:21.015
get some Long Island Iced Teas?

18:22.669 --> 18:24.336
Uh, you guys are joking.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.171
Obviously you're kidding.

18:25.172 --> 18:26.205
Yeah, I get it.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.807
Uh, listen, um, just
order me whatever.

18:27.808 --> 18:28.642
I'll be right back.

18:28.642 --> 18:29.442
Excuse me.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.376
Hey, Ro. What's going on?

18:30.377 --> 18:31.410
I'm trying to have
a conversation.

18:31.411 --> 18:32.444
You interrupted me.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.445
Yeah, with the girl
and her boyfriend

18:33.446 --> 18:34.780
who's like a grown man.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.101
Look, look, look, that doesn't
even matter right now, okay?

18:37.125 --> 18:40.119
What matters is is that Barrett
is talking shit to those hack.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.220
Ghostbusters over there.

18:41.221 --> 18:42.454
It's about to get ugly, dude.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.189
I ain't afraid of
no ghosts, man!

18:43.190 --> 18:44.690
Oh, shit. Oh, it's on!

18:44.691 --> 18:45.626
Okay, man. You got Egon.

18:45.626 --> 18:46.560
Wait.

18:46.561 --> 18:47.827
Which one's Egon? The black one?

18:47.828 --> 18:48.662
No!

18:48.663 --> 18:49.962
All right, sorry.

18:49.963 --> 18:53.365
Um, it's even numbers, so
I'm gonna sit this one out.

18:53.366 --> 18:54.334
Right here!

18:54.334 --> 18:55.334
Right here!

18:59.240 --> 19:00.240
Wait.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.207
What?

19:01.208 --> 19:02.374
‐Your mustache. ‐Okay.

19:02.375 --> 19:03.375
Okay

19:09.550 --> 19:10.583
Adam, Adam, okay.

19:10.584 --> 19:12.818
There are two horny
devils over there.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.219
I'm gonna need you
to be my wingman.

19:14.243 --> 19:14.821
Hey, hold on.

19:14.822 --> 19:15.862
I want to go to talk Beth.

19:15.886 --> 19:17.320
Wingman, dude!

19:22.596 --> 19:25.497
What are you dressed‐‐ as some
kind of old‐timey prostitute?

19:25.498 --> 19:28.501
Unless you are a
modern prostitute.

19:28.502 --> 19:29.836
Compliment!

19:31.305 --> 19:32.305
Wait, Mook, no, don't.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.106
Don't, Mook.

19:33.107 --> 19:36.042
After‐party our place!

19:39.913 --> 19:42.815
South Central does
it like nobody does.

19:42.816 --> 19:44.917
This is how we do it.

19:44.918 --> 19:46.151
Something, something.

19:46.152 --> 19:48.232
So it's 3:00 in the morning,
and you're at our house,

19:48.256 --> 19:49.822
and you have a boyfriend.

19:49.823 --> 19:52.057
Thanks for not
opening with that.

19:52.058 --> 19:53.426
Gabrus, you smell like herb.

19:54.828 --> 19:56.662
Gotta get your groove on.

19:56.663 --> 19:59.565
Did you see that thing?

19:59.566 --> 20:00.500
Howie.

20:00.501 --> 20:02.602
Hey, hey, it's my landlord.

20:02.603 --> 20:03.369
You're out.

20:03.370 --> 20:04.770
Why do you like me?

20:04.771 --> 20:07.106
Why don't you just like me?

20:07.107 --> 20:09.441
I mean, this is honestly
an enormous shocker.

20:09.442 --> 20:10.943
And I haven't received rent.

20:10.944 --> 20:13.412
This is the third time
I've been here this month.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.547
Your move.

20:14.548 --> 20:15.948
You know, man. I
mean, what is this?

20:15.972 --> 20:17.406
That's it. I'm done.

20:20.453 --> 20:23.589
Okay, the bad news is,
that was the landlord.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.357
Barrett didn't mail our rent.

20:25.358 --> 20:27.326
So we're evicted.

20:27.327 --> 20:32.397
But, uh, the good news is, we
ain't got nothing left to lose!

20:32.398 --> 20:35.067
Crank up the music, Mooker!

20:35.068 --> 20:36.569
Let's fucking go! Go!

20:36.570 --> 20:37.403
Go!

20:37.404 --> 20:39.071
Go!

20:39.072 --> 20:40.674
Yeah!

20:44.145 --> 20:45.145
Whoa.

20:45.146 --> 20:46.146
What's going on?

20:46.146 --> 20:46.947
Hey.

20:46.948 --> 20:49.148
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

20:49.149 --> 20:50.116
Where are you going?

20:50.117 --> 20:51.817
I'm fucking out of here, dude.

20:51.818 --> 20:52.719
No, no.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.319
You were in with the toad.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.655
You've done so
much worse before.

20:55.656 --> 20:56.623
Come on. ‐Not tonight, dude.

20:56.623 --> 20:57.423
Come on.

20:57.423 --> 20:58.324
What's the matter?

20:58.325 --> 20:59.625
Nothing's the matter, dude.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.661
I'm just not fucking
feeling it, all right?

21:01.662 --> 21:04.163
I'm just‐‐ I'm‐‐ I'm done
wasting time, all right?

21:04.164 --> 21:04.965
Wasting what?

21:04.966 --> 21:05.966
What?

21:05.967 --> 21:07.099
Man, we're always
living like this,

21:07.100 --> 21:08.900
like we're still living
like we're in college.

21:08.901 --> 21:09.802
What's wrong with college?

21:09.803 --> 21:10.736
Listen to me, man.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.371
We're getting evicted, dude.

21:12.372 --> 21:14.507
And my brother's
getting married.

21:14.508 --> 21:16.175
My boss thinks I'm a pervert.

21:16.176 --> 21:18.277
Newsflash‐‐ he's kinda right.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.646
Should I call my girlfriend
for some device?

21:20.647 --> 21:22.615
Oh, no, I can't do
that, because she's

21:22.616 --> 21:24.316
dating a superstar celebrity.

21:24.317 --> 21:25.251
And guess what I am?

21:25.252 --> 21:27.019
A California Raisin.

21:27.020 --> 21:28.954
Hey, we are all raisins, baby!

21:28.955 --> 21:29.956
Yeah, we are all raisins.

21:30.757 --> 21:31.924
Raisins for life.

21:31.925 --> 21:33.565
You're not supposed to
be happy about that

21:33.589 --> 21:35.895
is my whole point, is that
we're all raisins, and great.

21:35.896 --> 21:37.229
That's not a good fucking thing.

21:37.230 --> 21:39.899
We live every day, and every
day is always the same,

21:39.900 --> 21:40.966
day in and day out, right?

21:40.967 --> 21:41.868
We're going to bars.

21:41.869 --> 21:42.935
We get into bar fights.

21:42.936 --> 21:44.136
We go into karaokes.

21:44.137 --> 21:45.638
We do karaoke sings, okay?

21:45.639 --> 21:47.306
I work for lacrosse, dude.

21:47.307 --> 21:49.008
And that's not cool.

21:49.009 --> 21:51.677
It was supposed to be a stepping
stone, but now it's my career.

21:51.678 --> 21:53.579
I‐‐ I try to meet a girl.

21:53.580 --> 21:54.814
I can't do that, okay?

21:54.815 --> 21:56.775
What about the girl that
works in my office, Beth?

21:56.776 --> 21:58.776
She doesn't want to go out
with a guy who can't put

21:58.800 --> 21:59.719
on his shoulders.

21:59.720 --> 22:01.640
She doesn't want to go out
with a guy who doesn't

22:01.664 --> 22:03.122
have a nice watch collection.

22:03.123 --> 22:04.223
I have one watch.

22:04.224 --> 22:05.344
It's rubber and it's orange.

22:05.368 --> 22:07.426
And I don't even know
where it is, dude.

22:07.427 --> 22:09.161
I have no dentist, okay?

22:09.162 --> 22:11.296
I don't know how to
open a bottle of wine.

22:11.297 --> 22:12.832
I try to open up a
bottle of wine.

22:12.833 --> 22:14.767
Every time I try to
open a bottle of wine,

22:14.768 --> 22:15.935
the cork goes in the wine.

22:15.936 --> 22:18.137
And I'm always like,
who gives a shit?

22:18.138 --> 22:19.498
I'll‐‐ I'll drink
this shit anyway.

22:19.522 --> 22:20.405
And‐‐.

22:20.406 --> 22:21.806
What the fuck are
you talking about?

22:21.830 --> 22:22.842
I'll tell you right now.

22:22.843 --> 22:25.477
I‐‐ I fucking have a cork
inside me right now.

22:25.478 --> 22:27.798
And I'm gonna‐‐ and right now
is the moment where I'm going

22:27.822 --> 22:30.049
to start to give a shit.

22:30.050 --> 22:32.450
Because I don't‐‐ I'm not going
to have a cork in me anymore,

22:32.474 --> 22:33.474
and I'm done.

22:36.122 --> 22:37.682
Wait, are you breaking
up with us, dude?

22:40.360 --> 22:43.829
Yeah, I think I‐‐ I think I
am breaking up with you guys.

22:43.830 --> 22:46.999
Because we could use
some time apart.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Wow.

22:48.001 --> 22:49.902
You son of a bitch!

22:49.903 --> 22:50.871
All right, dude.

22:50.872 --> 22:52.071
What?

22:52.072 --> 22:53.706
You're drunk.

22:53.707 --> 22:56.008
You don't want to say something
right now that you're not

22:56.009 --> 22:57.109
going to be able to take back.

22:57.110 --> 22:57.911
Hey, you know what?

22:57.911 --> 22:58.845
I'm done with this.

22:58.846 --> 23:00.112
I'm done with totes.

23:00.113 --> 23:02.193
I'm done with "This Is How
We Do It," Montell Jordan.

23:02.217 --> 23:02.849
Oh, no, no.

23:02.850 --> 23:04.517
You leave Montell out of this.

23:04.518 --> 23:05.318
Shots fired.

23:05.319 --> 23:06.552
Don't you dare.

23:06.553 --> 23:08.020
‐That is not good. ‐Don't
you fucking dare, Adam.

23:08.021 --> 23:09.021
That is not good.

23:09.022 --> 23:11.123
Okay, so you're just
going to walk away

23:11.124 --> 23:12.992
after all the laughs
we've had and

23:12.993 --> 23:15.027
after everything I sacrificed.

23:15.028 --> 23:16.495
You're just going to walk away.

23:16.496 --> 23:17.530
Oh, you sacrifice it?

23:17.531 --> 23:18.698
Yeah, yeah, I sacrifice.

23:18.699 --> 23:21.233
I don't have a fucking
dentist either, man.

23:21.234 --> 23:22.702
My teeth hurt like shit!

23:22.703 --> 23:23.736
That's my whole point.

23:23.737 --> 23:24.705
It's over.

23:24.705 --> 23:25.672
You're over!

23:25.672 --> 23:26.672
It's over!

23:33.113 --> 23:34.580
So, uh, listen.

23:34.581 --> 23:39.451
I, um‐‐ I want to apologize
about last night.

23:39.452 --> 23:43.556
I know I said some‐‐
heh‐‐ harsh things.

23:43.557 --> 23:46.358
But I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

23:46.359 --> 23:49.762
Well, I accept your apology.

23:49.763 --> 23:53.365
Consider every word
you said taken back.

23:53.366 --> 23:57.002
That's actually the thing
about that, is that, um,

23:57.003 --> 24:00.573
there were parts that I‐‐ I
do still kind of agree with,

24:00.574 --> 24:03.576
and one of them being
that I think maybe we

24:03.577 --> 24:04.777
spend too much time together.

24:04.778 --> 24:08.013
And, uh, we should break up.

24:08.014 --> 24:09.481
Adam's just not that into us.

24:09.482 --> 24:10.383
No, dude.

24:10.384 --> 24:11.751
Look.

24:11.752 --> 24:14.119
Have any of us changed at all
since we've met each other?

24:14.120 --> 24:14.921
Yes!

24:14.922 --> 24:16.188
Howie's fatter now.

24:16.189 --> 24:17.590
Significantly fatter.

24:17.591 --> 24:18.658
Yeah, I did it on purpose.

24:18.659 --> 24:20.926
Okay, can I weigh in
here for a second?

24:20.927 --> 24:22.261
Jesus.

24:22.262 --> 24:25.464
Howie, you've never
been promoted ever.

24:25.465 --> 24:27.746
Well, I don't think my job
really does that sort of thing.

24:28.401 --> 24:29.502
They do that at your job.

24:29.503 --> 24:30.370
They do that at every job.

24:30.371 --> 24:31.403
Every job has promotions.

24:31.404 --> 24:32.272
Every job has promotions.

24:32.273 --> 24:34.073
You're not a prostitute.

24:34.074 --> 24:35.274
There's somewhere to go.

24:35.275 --> 24:38.077
Barrett, you quit college
to join a dart league.

24:38.078 --> 24:39.045
Yes, I did.

24:39.045 --> 24:39.846
And we won.

24:39.846 --> 24:40.781
So it was worth it.

24:40.782 --> 24:42.181
Totally not worth it.

24:42.182 --> 24:45.084
And Mook, you know, you
work at the lacrosse thing.

24:45.085 --> 24:46.218
But I still don't
really know what

24:46.219 --> 24:47.452
you want to do with your life.

24:47.453 --> 24:48.621
I just want to dance.

24:48.622 --> 24:49.422
Exactly.

24:49.422 --> 24:50.223
Mook wants to dance.

24:50.224 --> 24:52.091
And he wouldn't‐‐ what?

24:52.092 --> 24:53.392
What?

24:53.393 --> 24:55.661
I didn't say anything.

24:55.662 --> 24:57.630
You want to dance.

24:57.631 --> 24:58.631
Homo.

24:59.100 --> 25:00.100
Okay, that's homophobic.

25:00.101 --> 25:01.233
Not cool.

25:01.234 --> 25:02.954
But I think‐‐ I think
that Adam has a point.

25:02.978 --> 25:05.738
You guys definitely
need a break from this.

25:05.739 --> 25:07.306
Of course, you'd never
be able to do it.

25:07.307 --> 25:08.141
But, you know.

25:08.142 --> 25:09.341
Wait, are you challenging us?

25:09.342 --> 25:10.810
Yeah, I'm challenging
you, Barrett.

25:10.811 --> 25:11.977
- Challenge accepted.
- Okay.

25:11.978 --> 25:13.178
Are there rules?
What are the rules?

25:13.179 --> 25:14.114
You guys want to see the rules?

25:14.115 --> 25:15.395
Okay, well, I brought the rules.

25:16.584 --> 25:17.584
What is that?

25:17.584 --> 25:18.418
These are the rules.

25:18.419 --> 25:19.419
These are the breakup contract.

25:19.420 --> 25:20.420
When did you write that?

25:20.421 --> 25:21.987
Well, when Adam
called me last night,

25:21.988 --> 25:23.188
I couldn't really go to sleep.

25:23.212 --> 25:24.289
So I drew this up.

25:24.290 --> 25:25.958
I knew that the only way you
guys would pay attention

25:25.959 --> 25:27.126
if I made this shit official.

25:27.127 --> 25:28.761
So here it is, okay?

25:28.762 --> 25:31.597
First up, all
communication cut off.

25:31.598 --> 25:33.438
This shit's not going to
happen forever, right?

25:33.462 --> 25:36.201
So I figure six months is a
good time for the breakup.

25:36.202 --> 25:37.469
My wedding is in six months.

25:37.470 --> 25:38.938
It seems like a natural end.

25:38.939 --> 25:40.706
And listen, I know
getting evicted sucks.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.908
But I worked that into
the contract, okay?

25:42.909 --> 25:44.877
It's going to help
the break up a ton.

25:44.878 --> 25:47.379
The three of you, I'll
find you all sublets.

25:47.380 --> 25:49.181
Adam, you can move in
with me and Amanda.

25:49.182 --> 25:50.783
Ha, your marriage is doomed.

25:50.784 --> 25:51.618
I think I'll help.

25:51.619 --> 25:52.718
Okay, Okay, okay.

25:52.719 --> 25:54.520
What kind of cool shit
do we get if we win?

25:54.521 --> 25:56.121
I'm glad you asked
that, Barrett.

25:56.122 --> 25:57.957
There's a place on 9th Street.

25:57.958 --> 25:59.692
I have this stuff on lockdown.

25:59.693 --> 26:02.013
I'm good friends with the owner,
and he gave me first dibs.

26:02.037 --> 26:03.228
‐What? ‐Yeah.

26:03.229 --> 26:06.098
It's not even available till
the spring, and it's amazing.

26:06.099 --> 26:08.367
Four bedrooms, two
baths, a dozen

26:08.368 --> 26:09.669
bars within walking distance.

26:09.670 --> 26:12.137
I would honestly move in
there myself if I wasn't‐‐.

26:12.138 --> 26:13.138
Making a huge mistake?

26:13.139 --> 26:14.874
I was going to say
happily living

26:14.875 --> 26:17.176
in a valley with my fiancee.

26:17.177 --> 26:18.737
And this could be for
us, like, to live.

26:18.738 --> 26:19.538
Like, we can live there?

26:19.539 --> 26:20.680
Now, listen.

26:20.681 --> 26:22.281
If this is going to work, there
needs to be consequences,

26:22.282 --> 26:24.216
and you guys need to
be horrified of them.

26:24.217 --> 26:26.285
I think if you break the
rules for the first time,

26:26.286 --> 26:27.419
I cancel fantasy football.

26:27.420 --> 26:28.288
You're not gonna do that.

26:28.289 --> 26:29.622
I'm just getting started.

26:29.623 --> 26:31.657
If you break the rules a second
time, this place is gone.

26:31.658 --> 26:32.958
Just erase it from your mind.

26:32.959 --> 26:34.860
And my bachelor party is
off, and I'm throwing

26:34.861 --> 26:36.901
- a jack and jill party instead.
- The fuck is that?

26:36.902 --> 26:37.669
I don't even know
what those are.

26:37.670 --> 26:38.764
Yeah, what is that?

26:38.765 --> 26:40.600
It's when the bride and groom
have their parties together.

26:40.601 --> 26:41.667
‐What? ‐Nobody does that.

26:41.668 --> 26:42.603
‐Do people do that?
‐That's bad for you.

26:42.604 --> 26:43.924
That's not even a
real thing, man.

26:43.948 --> 26:47.072
And if you break
it a third time,

26:47.073 --> 26:49.474
I'm going to make my
wedding a cash bar.

26:49.475 --> 26:53.078
And you could say goodbye
to fantasy baseball.

26:53.079 --> 26:54.914
Oh, my‐‐ I hate you, David.

26:54.915 --> 26:55.915
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

26:55.916 --> 26:56.916
What the fuck?

26:57.884 --> 26:59.018
- What are you doing, man?
- Chill.

26:59.019 --> 27:00.139
I'm upset too. I'm upset too.

27:00.140 --> 27:01.173
I have another question.

27:01.174 --> 27:01.922
Yes, sir.

27:01.923 --> 27:03.188
Why are you doing this?

27:03.189 --> 27:04.057
I don't know, guys.

27:04.058 --> 27:06.158
I think that it's a great thing.

27:06.159 --> 27:08.460
I think you guys have all
been like my older brothers.

27:08.461 --> 27:11.163
And I would just like the
see you all grow up.

27:11.164 --> 27:12.932
All of you.

27:12.933 --> 27:13.933
Just a little.

27:19.372 --> 27:20.439
I mean, look, you know?

27:20.440 --> 27:22.040
I think that some of
this stuff is harsh,

27:22.041 --> 27:23.281
but I think it should be harsh.

27:23.305 --> 27:27.913
I‐‐ I think that
this is a good idea.

27:27.914 --> 27:30.883
I think that we should do it.

27:30.884 --> 27:32.652
Adam, this is insane.

27:32.653 --> 27:34.019
This is really crazy.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.921
If you're trying to act like
you're just whispering to me,

27:35.922 --> 27:37.356
they can here you anyways.
So just talk louder.

27:37.357 --> 27:38.423
This is madness!

27:38.424 --> 27:39.659
‐Lower your voice. ‐ls
this a good level?

27:39.660 --> 27:40.826
‐Fuck split the difference.
‐ls this a good level?

27:40.827 --> 27:41.628
That's good.

27:41.629 --> 27:42.828
Look, Adam.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.063
Please.

27:44.064 --> 27:45.397
I'll change. I'll change.

27:45.398 --> 27:46.438
I'll do whatever you want.

27:46.462 --> 27:48.433
I'll do all the fucking
things you like,

27:48.434 --> 27:50.435
and I won't stop
until you say no.

27:50.436 --> 27:51.671
Just don't leave me!

27:51.672 --> 27:54.740
Don't leave me in the
fucking dust, man!

27:54.741 --> 27:56.076
Just please don't.

27:59.246 --> 28:00.246
Don't.

28:00.246 --> 28:01.246
Don't.

28:03.817 --> 28:05.651
Don't.

28:05.652 --> 28:07.419
Don't.

28:07.420 --> 28:08.521
Shit.

28:08.522 --> 28:10.162
You know, maybe we
should try the breakup.

28:29.543 --> 28:31.243
You really think I
should go three wide?

28:31.244 --> 28:32.311
That's not desperate?

28:32.312 --> 28:33.912
I mean, it depends on
who's on your team.

28:33.936 --> 28:34.880
But yeah.

28:34.881 --> 28:36.248
You know, I mean, it's a
passing league now, right?

28:36.249 --> 28:38.017
So if your fantasy football team
is running a flex position,

28:38.018 --> 28:39.458
then you got to add
a third receiver.

28:39.482 --> 28:41.086
Yeah, you know why
it's a passing league?

28:41.087 --> 28:42.647
Because nobody wants
to get hit anymore.

28:42.671 --> 28:43.590
Right? Heh?

28:43.591 --> 28:44.724
Huh?

28:44.725 --> 28:47.860
Like lacrosse‐‐ minimal
padding, sweat, dirt,

28:47.861 --> 28:49.428
hardcore athleticism.

28:49.429 --> 28:52.532
None of that pussy football
princess crap, right?

28:52.533 --> 28:53.366
Right.

28:53.367 --> 28:55.601
Real men get concussions, man.

28:55.602 --> 28:57.102
Lacrosse.

28:57.103 --> 28:58.571
Wow, that should be our motto.

28:58.572 --> 28:59.405
Yeah.

28:59.406 --> 29:01.707
Real men get concussions, man.

29:01.708 --> 29:02.576
Fucking lacrosse.

29:02.577 --> 29:03.709
Hell yeah. ‐Wow.

29:03.710 --> 29:04.744
You can't say "fuck." ‐No?

29:04.745 --> 29:05.712
Sponsored stuff, you can't‐‐.

29:05.712 --> 29:06.513
Okay.

29:06.513 --> 29:07.447
Right, well, all right.

29:07.447 --> 29:08.248
Right.

29:08.249 --> 29:09.882
That's why you're in PR.

29:09.883 --> 29:10.950
And I'm the boss. ‐Right.

29:10.951 --> 29:11.885
‐Right? ‐Right.

29:11.885 --> 29:12.686
Okay.

29:12.687 --> 29:13.719
Good talk, man.

29:13.720 --> 29:15.020
Good talk.

29:15.021 --> 29:17.657
Real men‐‐ real men
get concussions, man.

29:17.658 --> 29:18.858
Right, or something like that.

29:18.859 --> 29:19.693
But yeah.

29:19.694 --> 29:21.594
Real men get concussions, yo.

29:21.595 --> 29:23.328
Lacrosse, damn!

29:23.329 --> 29:24.489
That's a little urban, but‐‐.

29:24.513 --> 29:25.497
Damn!

29:25.498 --> 29:27.066
‐Something like that, yeah.
‐Just do it.

29:27.067 --> 29:28.067
Okay.

29:28.836 --> 29:29.836
Damn!

29:29.836 --> 29:30.836
That is.

29:33.740 --> 29:35.440
Holy shit, dude.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.042
Did you go shopping?

29:37.043 --> 29:39.979
You are fucking
good‐looking, my man.

29:39.980 --> 29:43.248
Guess I never really appreciated
that when we were together.

29:43.249 --> 29:45.009
Hey, what was going on
with you and Richtman?

29:45.033 --> 29:46.118
Are you in trouble, dude?

29:46.119 --> 29:49.188
No, he just sat down
and started talking

29:49.189 --> 29:51.056
to me like a real person.

29:51.057 --> 29:52.057
First time ever.

29:52.058 --> 29:54.860
Yeah, I bet it's because
you hot as shit.

29:54.861 --> 29:56.161
Did he ask about my report?

29:56.162 --> 29:57.229
I was rushed.

29:57.230 --> 29:59.364
I also technically
didn't do any research.

29:59.365 --> 30:01.934
Uh, yeah, didn't come up.

30:01.935 --> 30:02.736
Oh.

30:02.736 --> 30:03.537
Okay.

30:03.538 --> 30:06.038
Well, what did he ask about?

30:06.039 --> 30:07.007
It's not healthy, dude.

30:07.007 --> 30:07.808
Shouldn't say.

30:07.809 --> 30:09.341
Oh, just tell me, man.

30:09.342 --> 30:10.409
Fine.

30:10.410 --> 30:13.378
We were talking about
fantasy football.

30:13.379 --> 30:14.514
Oh.

30:14.515 --> 30:16.048
You were?

30:16.049 --> 30:16.850
Wow.

30:16.851 --> 30:19.318
Uh, okay.

30:19.319 --> 30:20.452
How was it? Was it good?

30:20.453 --> 30:21.254
How's his team?

30:21.255 --> 30:22.955
Is he better than me?

30:22.956 --> 30:23.790
Wasn't better than you.

30:23.791 --> 30:26.526
Just different.

30:26.527 --> 30:28.227
You now what?

30:28.228 --> 30:29.162
Fine!

30:29.163 --> 30:30.429
Be with Richtman!

30:30.430 --> 30:32.510
I never liked talking fantasy
with you, anyway, Adam.

30:32.534 --> 30:33.299
I faked it!

30:33.300 --> 30:36.368
Faked it every single time!

30:36.369 --> 30:37.170
Sorry.

30:37.171 --> 30:38.370
It's all right.

30:38.371 --> 30:41.574
It's okay.

30:41.575 --> 30:42.543
Hey, Adam.

30:42.544 --> 30:43.876
I'm just going around‐‐.

30:43.877 --> 30:44.845
Hey.

30:44.846 --> 30:45.911
Hey.

30:45.912 --> 30:47.547
Um, I'm just going
around getting people

30:47.548 --> 30:48.981
for kickball on the weekends.

30:48.982 --> 30:51.450
Should I just mark you down
as definitely too hungover

30:51.451 --> 30:53.519
to attend as usual?

30:53.520 --> 30:55.640
Well, you don't really mark
it down like that, do you?

30:55.641 --> 30:56.841
Oh, yeah. No, I do, absolutely.

30:56.865 --> 30:57.690
Uh, all right.

30:57.691 --> 31:00.225
Well, not today, because
I'm trying new things.

31:00.226 --> 31:01.561
So I'll be there.

31:01.562 --> 31:02.862
All right.

31:02.863 --> 31:05.064
That's, um‐‐ that's a good
look you got going on today.

31:05.065 --> 31:06.098
You look nice.

31:06.099 --> 31:07.099
Thanks.

31:11.772 --> 31:12.838
Hey, Jamie.

31:12.839 --> 31:15.608
Uh, listen I, uh‐‐
I changed my mind.

31:15.609 --> 31:17.369
You can tell your lonely
actress friend that,

31:17.393 --> 31:19.111
uh, I'd love to take her out.

31:19.112 --> 31:20.445
Oh, my god, that's so exciting.

31:20.446 --> 31:21.781
We could double date.

31:21.782 --> 31:22.915
Double date.

31:22.916 --> 31:24.750
Oh, well, who are you
gon‐‐ oh, uh, you know.

31:24.751 --> 31:26.686
Um, about Barrett‐‐
he, uh‐‐ actually‐‐.

31:26.687 --> 31:29.354
Yeah, I've been texting him,
and I haven't heard back.

31:29.355 --> 31:31.557
Did he die?

31:31.558 --> 31:34.026
Because that keeps
happening to me.

31:34.027 --> 31:35.327
No, he didn't die.

31:35.328 --> 31:37.997
So I'll just keep on texting
him then if he's not dead.

31:37.998 --> 31:39.264
Um, question.

31:39.265 --> 31:40.566
Uh, yeah?

31:40.567 --> 31:43.669
Where do you think Barrett
stands on the whole unicorn

31:43.670 --> 31:44.470
philosophy?

31:44.470 --> 31:45.438
What phil‐‐.

31:45.439 --> 31:46.872
Do you think he's into it?

31:46.873 --> 31:48.974
Or do you think he's against it?

31:48.975 --> 31:50.042
Uh, I don't know.

31:50.043 --> 31:54.046
I think maybe he's not
too into unicorns.

31:54.047 --> 31:57.617
But, I mean, that
can be negotiable.

31:57.618 --> 31:59.018
I guess anything is negotiable.

31:59.019 --> 31:59.953
I totally thought so.

31:59.953 --> 32:00.754
Right.

32:00.755 --> 32:01.954
Yes.

32:01.955 --> 32:03.795
I'm so excited you're
gonna go out with Krista.

32:03.819 --> 32:04.790
This is awesome.

32:04.791 --> 32:06.425
And she's not your
typical actress girl.

32:06.426 --> 32:07.492
She's great.

32:07.493 --> 32:09.161
She's like the most
normal person I now.

32:09.162 --> 32:10.162
Mm.

32:12.899 --> 32:14.600
I'm having the best time.

32:14.601 --> 32:15.401
Oh, good.

32:15.402 --> 32:16.536
Yeah.

32:16.537 --> 32:18.270
Once I told Jamie that I
over my black‐guy phase,

32:18.271 --> 32:19.791
she was all like, I'm
gonna set you up.

32:19.815 --> 32:20.574
And there you are.

32:20.575 --> 32:21.641
Here you are. ‐Oh, yeah.

32:21.642 --> 32:22.842
Okay.

32:22.843 --> 32:25.578
They say you once you go
black, you never go back.

32:25.579 --> 32:27.099
Well, you do once
your parents threaten

32:27.100 --> 32:28.434
to take away your inheritance.

32:28.435 --> 32:29.849
Now, I'm kidding.

32:29.850 --> 32:31.216
I just don't want
to be a stepmom.

32:31.217 --> 32:32.518
Oh. Oh.

32:32.519 --> 32:33.686
That's‐‐ that's so racist.

32:33.687 --> 32:34.487
That's‐‐.

32:34.488 --> 32:35.921
So enough about me.

32:35.922 --> 32:37.489
I want to know about you, okay?

32:37.490 --> 32:38.724
Tell me everything.

32:38.725 --> 32:40.225
Everything.

32:40.226 --> 32:41.493
Okay.

32:41.494 --> 32:45.297
Um, uh, well, I was just‐‐
I was born outside of LA.

32:45.298 --> 32:47.098
Oh my god, we should just
get crazy right now!

32:47.122 --> 32:47.801
Am I right?

32:47.802 --> 32:48.868
Oh, my god.

32:48.869 --> 32:50.509
Can we have two butter nipples?
Not these.

32:50.533 --> 32:51.237
Those.

32:51.238 --> 32:52.572
Hey, do you want a head shot?

32:52.573 --> 32:55.007
Oh, I don't‐‐ I don't
think a head‐‐.

32:55.008 --> 32:57.577
Don't I look like such a
whore but in the best way?

32:57.578 --> 32:58.711
Right.

32:58.712 --> 32:59.812
You know what I'm saying?
That's all yours.

32:59.813 --> 33:01.113
I don't need this.
I'm not really‐‐.

33:01.114 --> 33:02.582
Yeah, most of the special
skills on the back

33:02.583 --> 33:03.416
are total bullshit.

33:03.417 --> 33:04.584
I do not speak French.

33:04.585 --> 33:06.185
I do not kayak.

33:06.186 --> 33:09.421
The last thing on
there‐‐ that's true.

33:09.422 --> 33:12.725
How is‐‐ how is "no
gag reflex" something

33:12.726 --> 33:15.126
that's considered something that
you would put on this paper?

33:15.150 --> 33:16.361
I don't‐‐ ‐I'll show you.

33:16.362 --> 33:17.330
So you just‐‐ ‐No, no, no.

33:17.330 --> 33:18.131
Uh‐huh.

33:18.131 --> 33:18.999
Oh, Okay, I get it.

33:19.000 --> 33:20.199
Hmm?

33:20.200 --> 33:22.267
I get it.

33:22.268 --> 33:23.069
Tada.

33:23.070 --> 33:24.504
‐Mm. ‐Right?

33:24.505 --> 33:26.585
Your hands smell a little
weird, but you get over it.

33:26.609 --> 33:27.472
‐Cool. ‐How's this?

33:27.473 --> 33:28.941
Uh‐‐.

33:28.942 --> 33:30.409
Mm!

33:30.410 --> 33:32.477
I hate beer.

33:32.478 --> 33:33.546
I forgot.

33:33.547 --> 33:34.347
Thank you.

33:34.347 --> 33:35.181
Thanks.

33:35.182 --> 33:37.517
Cheers.

33:37.518 --> 33:38.584
Woo!

33:38.585 --> 33:39.385
So good.

33:39.385 --> 33:40.385
Ha‐ha‐ha.

33:44.457 --> 33:47.793
So, uh, you got your, uh,
car in valet too, or‐‐.

33:47.794 --> 33:48.695
Oh, no, no.

33:48.695 --> 33:49.495
I cannot drive.

33:49.496 --> 33:50.930
I am so drunk.

33:50.931 --> 33:52.832
Hey, let's just go
back to your place.

33:52.833 --> 33:54.066
Um, you know what?

33:54.067 --> 33:55.535
I probably shouldn't‐‐ I
probably shouldn't do that,

33:55.536 --> 33:56.469
because, uh‐‐ ‐No, come on!

33:56.470 --> 33:58.003
Take me to your
place, you bitch!

33:58.004 --> 33:58.972
This is your car?

33:58.972 --> 33:59.773
Yeah.

33:59.774 --> 34:00.774
This is it?

34:00.775 --> 34:02.742
I'm getting in.

34:02.743 --> 34:05.177
Oh, god!

34:05.178 --> 34:06.178
I'm sorry.

34:11.018 --> 34:12.018
Oh, that butt.

34:12.018 --> 34:13.318
Oh, that butt. ‐Hey,
you know what?

34:13.319 --> 34:14.286
I don't think we can do this.

34:14.288 --> 34:15.621
I don't have protection on me.

34:15.621 --> 34:16.722
Oh.

34:16.723 --> 34:18.724
Good thing you said
something, because I do.

34:18.725 --> 34:19.525
Okay.

34:19.527 --> 34:20.527
Always.

34:20.527 --> 34:22.094
What, do you just
have those on you?

34:22.094 --> 34:23.128
We are so gonna fuck!

34:23.129 --> 34:24.329
Shh, shh.

34:24.330 --> 34:26.210
My brother and his fiancee
are in the next room,

34:26.210 --> 34:27.112
so we have to be quiet, okay?

34:27.112 --> 34:28.400
Do you want them to catch?

34:28.400 --> 34:30.002
- ‐Of fucking course not!
- ‐I'm totally.

34:30.003 --> 34:31.370
- ‐No, no way.
- ‐.

34:31.371 --> 34:32.471
Stay there. ‐Okay

34:32.472 --> 34:33.373
‐Stay there,. ‐Oh, Jesus.

34:33.373 --> 34:34.174
Ugh!

34:34.174 --> 34:35.141
This‐‐ this is happening?

34:35.141 --> 34:37.510
Oh, it is fucking
happening, mister!

34:37.511 --> 34:38.311
Ready? ‐Yeah.

34:38.312 --> 34:39.945
‐ ‐

34:39.946 --> 34:41.112
Oh, are you serious?

34:41.114 --> 34:42.815
Fucking aah!

34:42.815 --> 34:44.216
Get ready for the
ride of your life,

34:44.239 --> 34:46.318
because I watch a
fuckload of porn!

34:46.319 --> 34:47.485
How do you like this?

34:47.487 --> 34:48.288
Take it!

34:48.288 --> 34:49.089
No.

34:49.090 --> 34:50.455
Can you breathe?

34:50.456 --> 34:52.091
Take it.

34:52.092 --> 34:53.425
I'm not gonna pee on you.

34:53.426 --> 34:54.694
I hope that's cool with you.

34:54.695 --> 34:56.027
It reminds of an ex.

34:56.029 --> 34:58.130
You're legitimately scaring
the shit out of me.

34:58.131 --> 34:59.411
You have your yellow fever shot?

34:59.435 --> 35:00.432
Uh‐‐.

35:00.433 --> 35:02.393
Because you are about to
enter the fucking jungle.

35:02.417 --> 35:03.685
Yeah! ‐.

35:07.073 --> 35:10.009
What is it?

35:10.010 --> 35:10.977
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

35:10.978 --> 35:12.512
Hey, for real?

35:12.513 --> 35:14.580
Braise yourself.

35:14.581 --> 35:15.881
Time to feed the tiger.

35:15.882 --> 35:16.750
‐No!

35:16.750 --> 35:17.551
No, no, no, no.

35:17.552 --> 35:18.552
No, no, no.

35:18.552 --> 35:19.552
Rah!

35:54.320 --> 35:55.320
Oh, fuck.

35:59.860 --> 36:00.993
Good morning!

36:00.994 --> 36:02.395
Hey.

36:04.264 --> 36:07.767
Hey, um, what
happened last night?

36:07.768 --> 36:12.272
Because I never get
that drunk, like, ever.

36:14.575 --> 36:18.343
Did you, um, roofie me maybe?

36:18.344 --> 36:20.813
You're just so naughty.

36:20.814 --> 36:22.447
You must've worked
up an appetite,

36:22.448 --> 36:24.449
so I'm going to make
you eggs, okay?

36:24.450 --> 36:25.785
Oh.

36:25.786 --> 36:28.754
And speaking of eggs, there's
a lot going on down here.

36:28.755 --> 36:30.857
So maybe the condom broke.

36:32.058 --> 36:33.059
One can hope, right?

36:35.796 --> 36:37.516
Oh, hey, guys. Guys,
guys, guys, guys, guys.

36:37.517 --> 36:38.785
Go back to bed. Go back to bed.

36:38.786 --> 36:40.666
You don't need to, uh,
be up this early.

36:40.667 --> 36:42.067
I can make you
breakfast, seriously.

36:42.068 --> 36:43.235
‐Oh, that's sweet. ‐Really?

36:43.236 --> 36:44.069
That's sweet.

36:44.070 --> 36:45.738
An old‐school Adam omelette?
I'm down.

36:45.739 --> 36:47.539
Yeah, well, it's the least
I can do, you know?

36:47.563 --> 36:48.641
I mean, just relax.

36:48.642 --> 36:51.043
Go back to bed, really.

36:51.044 --> 36:52.645
What's going on in my kitchen?

36:52.646 --> 36:54.647
Go, my go‐‐ my god.

36:54.648 --> 37:00.119
Um, it, uh, just kinda happened.

37:00.120 --> 37:01.453
Um‐‐.

37:01.454 --> 37:02.688
What is on her ass?

37:02.689 --> 37:03.489
What is that?

37:03.490 --> 37:05.858
Yeah, it's of, uh, a tiger.

37:05.859 --> 37:06.827
Um‐‐.

37:06.827 --> 37:07.628
Oh.

37:07.629 --> 37:08.894
Oh.

37:08.895 --> 37:10.935
Is that why we heard growling
and crying last night?

37:10.936 --> 37:12.536
Because I thought you
were just watching.

37:12.560 --> 37:13.899
Animal Planet stoned again.

37:13.900 --> 37:14.735
No.

37:14.736 --> 37:15.935
No.

37:15.936 --> 37:18.804
Well, uh‐‐ when you‐‐ she
bounces up and down‐‐.

37:18.805 --> 37:19.740
Don't. Stop.

37:19.740 --> 37:20.541
Oh, my god.

37:20.542 --> 37:21.874
What did you do?

37:21.875 --> 37:23.308
Her ass cheeks go like this,
and a tiger goes like this.

37:23.309 --> 37:24.309
Oh, my god.

37:24.310 --> 37:25.278
Oh.

37:25.279 --> 37:26.712
I don't‐‐ oh, my god!

37:26.713 --> 37:28.180
‐Come on. ‐You know what?

37:28.181 --> 37:29.741
Tell her to get some
underwear on, okay?

37:29.765 --> 37:31.116
Okay I'll handle it, baby.

37:31.117 --> 37:33.919
I will handle it with care.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.220
Hey, but seriously. What?

37:35.221 --> 37:36.421
Tell me everything.

37:36.422 --> 37:38.758
When you do doggy
style with her‐‐ when

37:38.759 --> 37:40.425
you do doggy style
with her‐‐ ‐Right.

37:40.426 --> 37:42.546
‐‐it looks like the tiger's
going like‐‐ it looks like

37:42.570 --> 37:44.072
the tiger's going like this.

37:45.732 --> 37:47.132
I see what's
happening, 'cause it's

37:47.133 --> 37:50.002
like‐‐ it's kind of
like the cartoon tiger,

37:50.003 --> 37:51.036
except it's hornier.

37:51.037 --> 37:51.972
Yeah, have you ever
seen that YouTube

37:51.973 --> 37:53.173
video where the panda sneezes?

37:53.197 --> 37:54.006
Yeah.

37:54.007 --> 37:55.527
It's like that, only
with a tiger butt.

37:55.551 --> 37:58.644
It's with an asshole
for a mouth.

37:58.645 --> 37:59.645
All right.

38:02.016 --> 38:03.016
No. What?

38:03.016 --> 38:03.817
No!

38:03.817 --> 38:04.785
No!

38:04.786 --> 38:06.752
I need a good toss
from you, honey.

38:06.753 --> 38:07.753
Take five.

38:12.392 --> 38:13.926
Hey, you came.

38:13.927 --> 38:16.327
You know, I thought that this
was gonna like an ironic thing.

38:16.351 --> 38:18.463
But you guys really take
this seriously, huh?

38:18.464 --> 38:20.399
Yeah, some of us
more than others.

38:20.400 --> 38:23.302
You should stretch
before we start.

38:23.303 --> 38:25.237
I'm not kidding. you will
thank me later, okay?

38:25.238 --> 38:26.039
Okay.

38:26.039 --> 38:27.039
Yeah, stretch.

38:39.587 --> 38:40.587
Jesus.

38:40.587 --> 38:41.587
Hey.

38:44.691 --> 38:46.859
What the hell are you
doing here, man?

38:46.860 --> 38:48.994
Just trying something new.

38:48.995 --> 38:50.362
What are you doing?

38:50.363 --> 38:54.700
I always wanted to be a part
of my office kickball league.

38:54.701 --> 38:55.735
It's one of my dreams.

38:55.736 --> 38:56.637
So here I am.

38:56.638 --> 38:57.937
Heh.

38:57.938 --> 39:00.339
But unlike you, I'm‐‐ I'm
doing it with some dignity.

39:00.340 --> 39:03.342
You're wearing jean shorts
to a kickball game?

39:03.343 --> 39:04.210
I mean, heh‐heh.

39:04.211 --> 39:05.578
You know what?

39:05.579 --> 39:07.899
I just kind of decided I‐‐ I
was too old to have jeans with

39:07.923 --> 39:09.481
holes in them, and I just‐‐.

39:09.482 --> 39:10.583
Oh, my god.

39:10.584 --> 39:12.017
Yeah?

39:12.018 --> 39:13.786
These were your cool jeans.

39:13.787 --> 39:16.756
Your amazing cool jeans
that I worship that

39:16.757 --> 39:19.191
had the most perfect
hole right in the knee‐‐

39:19.192 --> 39:20.693
a hole that you earned.

39:20.694 --> 39:24.196
You cut those jeans
into jean shorts?

39:24.197 --> 39:25.330
Who are you, man?

39:25.331 --> 39:27.232
I don't‐‐ I don't
know who you are.

39:27.233 --> 39:28.634
It's really not a big deal, man.

39:28.635 --> 39:30.995
I don't know why‐‐ why you're
getting all bent out of shape.

39:31.019 --> 39:33.573
Yeah, well, just so you know,
Okay, whenever I close my eyes,

39:33.574 --> 39:35.975
I'm going to picture you
in your cool jeans.

39:35.976 --> 39:36.843
Okay.

39:36.844 --> 39:39.979
Not any fucking
jean shorts, okay?

39:39.980 --> 39:40.947
How about this?

39:40.948 --> 39:42.381
Uh, we're broken up,
and we actually

39:42.382 --> 39:43.983
shouldn't be talking, much
less closing our eyes

39:43.984 --> 39:44.984
and thinking about each other.

39:44.985 --> 39:46.185
That's super fucking weird.

39:46.186 --> 39:47.653
Well, here's the other
thing about my mind, man.

39:47.654 --> 39:49.774
I don't really care about
your stupid little contract.

39:49.798 --> 39:50.490
Okay.

39:50.491 --> 39:52.224
In my mind, I don't
care about it.

39:52.225 --> 39:54.059
Well, in my mind, I care
about the contract.

39:54.060 --> 39:55.360
So how do you explain that?

39:55.361 --> 39:57.963
Well, in my mind, we're not
talking about that at all.

39:57.964 --> 40:00.465
We're continuing the
conversation about the jeans.

40:00.466 --> 40:02.826
In my mind, the conversation
shifted into a different thing.

40:02.827 --> 40:03.947
Well, in my mind, it didn't.

40:03.971 --> 40:06.205
In my mind, it's about,
uh, 20 minutes long.

40:06.206 --> 40:08.808
And in the midst of that
conversation in my mind,

40:08.809 --> 40:12.845
you apologize for cutting your
jeans into stupid fucking jean

40:12.846 --> 40:14.146
shorts.

40:14.147 --> 40:16.649
And then also in my mind, I
don't accept your apology.

40:16.650 --> 40:18.684
I don't accept your
apology in my mind!

40:18.685 --> 40:20.365
Well, in my mind, you
accepted the apology.

40:20.389 --> 40:22.755
You‐‐ you totally graciously
accept the apology.

40:22.756 --> 40:24.436
And you were even a
little bit‐‐ you bowed.

40:24.437 --> 40:25.997
You were a little bit
Japanese about it.

40:26.021 --> 40:27.021
How's that?

40:32.099 --> 40:33.099
Jesus.

40:33.100 --> 40:35.234
Howie!

40:35.235 --> 40:36.036
What are you doing?

40:36.036 --> 40:36.937
Oh!

40:36.937 --> 40:37.738
Hey!

40:37.739 --> 40:39.138
What the hell, man?

40:39.139 --> 40:41.173
Where are you going?

40:41.174 --> 40:42.608
Howie?

40:42.609 --> 40:44.244
Howie?

40:49.716 --> 40:50.716
I got it!

40:54.187 --> 40:55.721
‐Hey, man, how's it going?
‐You're not gonna run to second?

40:55.722 --> 40:56.690
Huh? No.

40:56.690 --> 40:57.423
No, no, no. I'm not
gonna do that.

40:57.423 --> 40:58.358
Oh.

40:58.359 --> 40:59.859
Hey, I'm sorry
about before, man.

40:59.860 --> 41:01.140
Yeah, don't worry about it, man.

41:01.164 --> 41:01.762
It's all good.

41:01.762 --> 41:02.629
Hey, hey, hey.

41:02.629 --> 41:03.530
We don't want to
make this weird.

41:03.531 --> 41:04.997
No, of course not. Yeah.

41:04.998 --> 41:05.998
Thank you.

41:16.911 --> 41:17.911
Woo!

41:17.912 --> 41:21.313
That's game, you guys.

41:21.314 --> 41:22.434
Hey, Beth, thanks for today.

41:22.458 --> 41:23.482
That was fun. ‐Yeah!

41:23.483 --> 41:24.284
Yeah.

41:24.285 --> 41:25.317
Yeah.

41:25.318 --> 41:26.852
Um, are you going to
come to Big Wangs?

41:26.853 --> 41:27.853
Oh, Wangers?

41:27.854 --> 41:29.321
You‐‐ you guys are
going to Wangers?

41:29.322 --> 41:30.223
Heh.

41:30.224 --> 41:31.224
Nobody calls it that.

41:31.225 --> 41:32.692
But yeah, we go every Saturday.

41:32.693 --> 41:33.493
Cool.

41:33.493 --> 41:34.493
Yeah, I'm in.

41:43.436 --> 41:44.737
I knew it.

41:44.738 --> 41:47.106
I mean, deep down, you know
it's an athletic ability.

41:47.107 --> 41:49.107
I mean, I haven't kicked a
ball since eighth grade,

41:49.108 --> 41:50.428
but I've been
competitive‐drinking

41:50.452 --> 41:51.043
since ninth.

41:51.044 --> 41:52.344
Hi.

41:52.345 --> 41:54.680
Sorry to interrupt, but did
you lose a business card?

41:54.681 --> 41:55.881
No I don't‐‐.

41:55.882 --> 41:58.551
No, you didn't, because
that one's mine.

41:58.552 --> 42:01.486
Call me.

42:01.487 --> 42:02.455
That's a good move, man.

42:02.455 --> 42:03.256
I got to do that.

42:03.257 --> 42:04.690
Perhaps some business cards.

42:04.691 --> 42:06.692
Holy shit, dude.

42:06.693 --> 42:08.928
Adam!

42:08.929 --> 42:09.763
You two know each other?

42:09.764 --> 42:11.931
Uh, I mean‐‐.

42:11.932 --> 42:13.265
Shit, yeah, we do.

42:13.266 --> 42:15.267
This is Adam Bomb right here.

42:15.268 --> 42:16.202
Right, Adam Bomb.

42:16.202 --> 42:17.070
Adam Bomb!

42:17.070 --> 42:18.038
Like the bomb.

42:18.039 --> 42:19.739
Adam Bomb, like the
atom bomb, dude.

42:19.740 --> 42:20.940
Exactly.

42:20.941 --> 42:21.974
Great to see you, man.

42:21.975 --> 42:23.455
You gonna introduce
me to your friend?

42:23.479 --> 42:24.744
Uh, Beth, Butler.

42:24.745 --> 42:25.546
Hi.

42:25.547 --> 42:27.680
It's very nice to meet you.

42:27.681 --> 42:29.041
Butler's not my
first name, though.

42:29.042 --> 42:30.522
I only give my first
name out to women

42:30.546 --> 42:32.017
I'm about to have sex with.

42:32.018 --> 42:35.487
It's Andrew.

42:35.488 --> 42:36.488
Wow.

42:36.489 --> 42:38.958
I'm going to go to
the ladies' room.

42:38.959 --> 42:40.893
Want to meet me back there?

42:40.894 --> 42:41.695
Don't knock, you know?

42:41.696 --> 42:43.529
Just‐‐ just blaze right in.

42:43.530 --> 42:45.865
I absolutely will.

42:45.866 --> 42:47.633
God, that's never
actually worked before.

42:47.634 --> 42:49.034
‐Right. ‐Shit, man.

42:49.035 --> 42:50.635
So how's it been going
since high school?

42:50.636 --> 42:51.996
Do people still
call you Adam Bomb?

42:52.020 --> 42:53.506
Uh, no.

42:53.507 --> 42:54.947
Nobody really called
me that but you.

42:54.971 --> 42:55.676
No, man, no.

42:55.677 --> 42:56.837
Other people called you that.

42:56.861 --> 42:58.511
Well, you bullied
them into that.

42:58.512 --> 42:59.779
‐Yeah. ‐Yeah.

42:59.780 --> 43:00.980
Shit, man, I was good at that.

43:00.981 --> 43:02.781
Good at‐‐ there's no good
at bullying, really.

43:02.805 --> 43:03.616
It's just bad.

43:03.617 --> 43:04.484
No, you can be good
at bullying, man.

43:04.484 --> 43:05.451
‐Yeah? ‐Oh, hello.

43:05.452 --> 43:06.852
Were you the guy
that ordered these?

43:06.853 --> 43:07.654
Yes, I was.

43:07.654 --> 43:08.454
Thank you very much.

43:08.454 --> 43:09.422
Oh, my‐‐ oh.

43:09.423 --> 43:10.656
Oh, shit.

43:10.657 --> 43:13.025
My god, I am so sorry, ma'am.

43:13.026 --> 43:13.860
I didn't mean to‐‐.

43:13.861 --> 43:15.761
Oh, my god.

43:15.762 --> 43:17.362
I totally meant to do that.

43:17.363 --> 43:18.598
That was for you, buddy.

43:18.599 --> 43:19.399
What?

43:19.399 --> 43:20.333
I saw some nipple in there.

43:20.334 --> 43:21.334
Did you see some nipple?

43:21.335 --> 43:22.602
I wasn't really looking
at her nipples.

43:22.603 --> 43:23.570
I totally saw a nipple.

43:23.571 --> 43:24.604
Hey, check it out.

43:24.605 --> 43:26.085
I'm gonna leave this
one here for you.

43:26.086 --> 43:27.926
I only get two so I can
come 'em on the ladies.

43:27.950 --> 43:29.074
‐Oh. ‐Great to see you, man.

43:29.075 --> 43:29.876
Look.

43:29.877 --> 43:31.644
Butler and the Bomb, man.

43:31.645 --> 43:32.778
We have got to hang out.

43:32.779 --> 43:33.879
That's my information.

43:33.880 --> 43:35.114
You give me a call.

43:35.115 --> 43:36.582
I'm gonna go to the bathroom,
because I don't know

43:36.583 --> 43:38.483
if your lady friend was kidding
about wanting to fuck me,

43:38.484 --> 43:40.244
but I am not going to
take that chance, okay?

43:40.268 --> 43:40.754
Okay.

43:40.754 --> 43:41.722
Great seeing you.

43:41.723 --> 43:43.188
Oh, Jesus.

43:43.189 --> 43:45.725
Fuck.

43:45.726 --> 43:46.560
Is the coast clear?

43:46.561 --> 43:47.993
Yeah, you're safe.

43:47.994 --> 43:49.161
That was weird.

43:49.162 --> 43:50.229
Yep.

43:50.230 --> 43:52.665
You should totally hang
out with that guy.

43:52.666 --> 43:53.499
He's got a great card.

43:53.499 --> 43:54.467
I don't know.

43:54.468 --> 43:55.788
I've done some awful
things, but I

43:55.789 --> 43:57.269
don't think I could
ever be as douchey

43:57.293 --> 43:59.038
as one of those finance guys.

43:59.039 --> 44:00.973
You know Justin's
in finance, right?

44:00.974 --> 44:01.775
Oh.

44:01.775 --> 44:02.609
Yeah.

44:02.610 --> 44:04.510
I mean, they're not all douches.

44:04.511 --> 44:05.311
I was just‐‐.

44:05.311 --> 44:06.179
No, they are.

44:06.179 --> 44:07.179
All of them.

44:31.071 --> 44:32.071
'Sup?

44:32.072 --> 44:32.873
Hmm?

44:32.874 --> 44:34.074
We're texting Barrett now?

44:37.010 --> 44:38.443
How the hell did you know?

44:38.444 --> 44:39.879
Well, I mean, I'm the best.

44:39.880 --> 44:40.913
I'm a mind reader.

44:40.914 --> 44:42.982
And I also took your
phone and changed

44:42.983 --> 44:44.850
all the guys' numbers
to mine, 'cause I

44:44.851 --> 44:46.451
knew you were gonna crack.

44:46.452 --> 44:47.853
Oh, come on.

44:47.854 --> 44:49.421
It was a moment of
weakness, all right?

44:49.422 --> 44:50.523
It won't happen again.

44:50.524 --> 44:52.357
Okay.

44:52.358 --> 44:53.759
And who texts "'sup" anyway?

44:53.760 --> 44:55.728
What are you, 15?

44:55.729 --> 44:56.862
So what's going on?

44:56.863 --> 44:58.463
Do you not know what
to do with yourself?

44:58.487 --> 45:00.432
Uh, I don't know.

45:00.433 --> 45:02.001
You need to try new things.

45:02.002 --> 45:03.135
You need to meet new people.

45:03.136 --> 45:06.371
Have you tried anything
new since the breakup?

45:06.372 --> 45:07.740
Yeah, I played kickball.

45:07.741 --> 45:09.308
Okay

45:09.309 --> 45:10.342
I fed a tiger.

45:10.343 --> 45:11.144
Good!

45:11.145 --> 45:12.377
Good, that's something.

45:12.378 --> 45:13.698
You would've never
gone to the zoo

45:13.722 --> 45:17.049
if you were still hanging
out‐‐ never mind, I got it.

45:17.050 --> 45:18.117
We should make a list.

45:18.118 --> 45:20.820
Uh, I'm not really a
list guy, you know?

45:20.821 --> 45:22.855
Adam.

45:22.856 --> 45:23.657
Okay.

45:23.658 --> 45:26.559
Uh, let's make a list.

45:26.560 --> 45:27.893
I'm proud of myself.

45:27.894 --> 45:29.374
This list is coming
along really well.

45:29.398 --> 45:31.664
We got "get contacts,"
'cause you need 'em.

45:31.665 --> 45:33.132
Get shirts that fit.

45:33.133 --> 45:35.067
And, uh, get off our
family plan, man.

45:35.068 --> 45:36.301
You're 30 years old.

45:36.302 --> 45:37.670
Yeah.

45:37.671 --> 45:39.304
Oh, also, I want you to put
down "have a threesome," too,

45:39.305 --> 45:41.273
because if I have to put down
and figure out what I'm going

45:41.274 --> 45:42.942
to do with my life, then
I want to have something

45:42.943 --> 45:44.109
to look forward to as well.
‐I'll put down threesome.

45:44.110 --> 45:45.578
Why are‐‐ what are
we doing here?

45:45.579 --> 45:46.479
Here you go.

45:46.480 --> 45:49.081
Thanks.

45:49.082 --> 45:50.082
Oh, my god.

45:50.083 --> 45:53.118
That‐‐ I love this.

45:53.119 --> 45:55.087
Do you have to display
them like we're‐‐.

45:55.088 --> 45:56.156
What is this?

45:57.958 --> 45:59.659
That's so cute, dude!

45:59.660 --> 46:00.493
Look at this.

46:00.494 --> 46:02.528
You're so cute here, for real.

46:02.529 --> 46:04.196
That's the cutest
thing I've ever seen.

46:04.197 --> 46:06.398
This looks like it would be
on the back of a‐‐ like,

46:06.399 --> 46:07.800
on a Spanish textbook.

46:07.801 --> 46:10.302
And this is how you'd learn
the word "happy" for Spanish.

46:10.303 --> 46:12.471
I want to get 70 of these and
line my wall in then so when

46:12.472 --> 46:13.606
I wake up I'm super happy.

46:13.607 --> 46:14.807
Do not put that on my account.

46:18.345 --> 46:19.345
Hey.

46:19.346 --> 46:20.513
Hey, what's up? Hi, Beth.

46:20.514 --> 46:21.914
Good morning. ‐Morning.

46:21.915 --> 46:23.348
What are you, uh‐‐ what
are you working on?

46:23.349 --> 46:25.149
Uh, if I tell you about
it, you promise you're

46:25.150 --> 46:26.085
not going to laugh at me?

46:26.085 --> 46:26.920
No.

46:26.921 --> 46:28.320
Okay, deal.

46:28.321 --> 46:30.681
I'm not allowed to post on any
of our fantasy message boards

46:30.705 --> 46:31.924
anymore.

46:31.925 --> 46:33.325
So I just kind of started
this thing where I‐‐ I mean,

46:33.326 --> 46:35.160
I guess it's a blog‐‐ where
I just write about sports‐‐

46:35.161 --> 46:36.161
like baseball, football.

46:36.162 --> 46:36.997
Lacrosse.

46:36.998 --> 46:37.998
Well, no, not lacrosse.

46:37.999 --> 46:39.399
People don't give a
shit about that.

46:39.423 --> 46:40.900
But yeah, it's
just like for fun.

46:40.901 --> 46:42.802
Like, I just write it to
get it out of my brain.

46:42.803 --> 46:44.436
I mean, nobody really sees it.

46:44.437 --> 46:46.171
Well, we should fix that.

46:46.172 --> 46:48.140
Okay.

46:48.141 --> 46:50.676
Um, you need, like, keywords.

46:50.677 --> 46:54.614
Like, Lakers, Yankees, boobs.

46:54.615 --> 46:55.615
Oh, yeah.

46:55.616 --> 46:56.550
I don't know about
what you're doing,

46:56.551 --> 46:57.883
but I was going
to suggest boobs.

46:57.884 --> 47:00.044
Yeah, because you can never
go wrong with boobs, right?

47:00.068 --> 47:00.453
Right.

47:00.454 --> 47:01.954
Well, that should‐‐ should help.

47:01.955 --> 47:02.756
Oh, wait.

47:02.757 --> 47:05.090
One second.

47:05.091 --> 47:05.892
What are you doing now?

47:05.893 --> 47:07.727
Just emailed it to myself.

47:07.728 --> 47:08.928
Oh, nice.

47:08.929 --> 47:10.462
I grew up with some pretty
die‐hard Niners fans,

47:10.463 --> 47:12.623
so I thought I'd send it to
them to see if you actually

47:12.624 --> 47:13.864
know what you're talking about.

47:13.888 --> 47:14.888
Okay.

47:22.142 --> 47:23.275
Hi.

47:23.276 --> 47:24.544
Hi.

47:24.545 --> 47:26.979
Uh, hey, so thanks for setting
me up with Krista, but‐‐.

47:26.980 --> 47:28.347
Oh yeah, whatever, she's crazy.

47:28.348 --> 47:30.583
Hey, have you spoken to Barrett?

47:30.584 --> 47:32.752
Uh, as a matter of
fact, no, I haven't

47:32.753 --> 47:33.753
talked to Barrett at all.

47:33.754 --> 47:34.588
Oh.

47:34.589 --> 47:36.055
That's good.

47:36.056 --> 47:37.936
He's just a hard guy to
get a hold of right now.

47:37.937 --> 47:39.097
Okay, cool. Talk to you later.

47:39.121 --> 47:40.121
Bye!

48:03.917 --> 48:06.185
Look, I feel really guilty
meeting up with you like this,

48:06.186 --> 48:07.306
but I really have no choice.

48:09.923 --> 48:11.591
You followed?

48:11.592 --> 48:13.425
No, I don't think so.

48:13.426 --> 48:14.360
Can't be too sure.

48:14.361 --> 48:17.329
We should probably
speak in code.

48:17.330 --> 48:20.566
The black scorpion
awaits in the dark.

48:20.567 --> 48:23.302
What‐‐ what are you
talking about?

48:23.303 --> 48:25.671
Is this about the man
in the green beret?

48:25.672 --> 48:26.540
Who?

48:26.541 --> 48:27.840
Dude, you texted secret meeting.

48:27.841 --> 48:29.108
I thought that means
we speak in code,

48:29.109 --> 48:30.109
like some bad‐ass spy shit.

48:30.110 --> 48:31.210
Okay, but you got to
be more specific.

48:31.211 --> 48:32.771
I don't know about
that shit‐‐ spy shit.

48:32.795 --> 48:33.679
‐Come on. ‐Why?

48:33.680 --> 48:35.314
Is that why you look
like Bruno Mars?

48:35.315 --> 48:36.182
It's kind of a good look.

48:36.183 --> 48:37.750
Oh, no.

48:37.751 --> 48:38.552
Anyways, what's up?

48:38.552 --> 48:39.385
Well, look.

48:39.386 --> 48:40.820
There's this girl at work, Beth.

48:40.821 --> 48:42.588
And she's been unusually
flirty lately.

48:42.589 --> 48:45.124
And I just‐‐ I think
recently, she

48:45.125 --> 48:46.325
broke up with her boyfriend.

48:46.326 --> 48:49.729
And I just don't‐‐ I don't
know what I should do.

48:49.730 --> 48:51.463
Okay, so you like her?

48:51.464 --> 48:53.899
Uh, I don't know, man.

48:53.900 --> 48:55.940
I mean, yeah, she's like the
perfect girl, you know?

48:55.964 --> 48:57.637
She's‐‐ she's smart.

48:57.638 --> 48:58.638
She's huge.

48:58.639 --> 49:00.039
She looks great in
a pair of shorts.

49:00.063 --> 49:00.940
That's good.

49:00.941 --> 49:02.007
Sometimes when I have
to make a decision,

49:02.008 --> 49:03.142
I'll think about what
Beth, would maybe

49:03.143 --> 49:04.677
think the right decision
was, and then I would

49:04.678 --> 49:05.978
gear my decision towards that.

49:05.979 --> 49:07.513
The other day, I was
at this crosswalk.

49:07.514 --> 49:09.381
And I was waiting to
cross the street.

49:09.382 --> 49:12.284
And I caught myself daydreaming
just about her laugh

49:12.285 --> 49:14.887
and about how cute Christmas
year her voice was.

49:14.888 --> 49:19.358
And I just‐‐ I totally
missed two walk signals.

49:19.359 --> 49:20.459
I don't know.

49:20.460 --> 49:21.261
If you're asking me
now, I guess I haven't

49:21.262 --> 49:22.461
really thought about it.

49:22.462 --> 49:24.422
So I just‐‐ I don't really
have an answer for you.

49:27.467 --> 49:29.301
Okay.

49:29.302 --> 49:31.470
Christmasy voice, huh?

49:31.471 --> 49:32.972
Here's what you got to do.

49:32.973 --> 49:35.040
If she's newly
single, that means

49:35.041 --> 49:38.310
you're not the only guy waiting
in the wings ready to pounce.

49:38.311 --> 49:39.712
You got to make a bold move.

49:39.713 --> 49:43.015
Can't just be another
shoulder for her to cry on.

49:43.016 --> 49:45.518
Not if you want her to
pounce on something else.

49:45.519 --> 49:46.679
I'm talking about your penis.

49:46.703 --> 49:47.687
No, I know.

49:47.688 --> 49:48.788
There's really no other
way to take that.

49:48.789 --> 49:50.255
You're homophobic if you
don't hold my hand.

49:50.256 --> 49:51.976
You're homophobic if you
don't hold my hand.

49:51.977 --> 49:53.297
Do I look like I've
gained weight?

49:53.321 --> 49:54.226
Yeah.

49:54.227 --> 49:55.360
‐Whoa! ‐Whoa!

49:55.361 --> 49:56.495
Whoa, whoa!

49:56.496 --> 49:58.016
See, I told you we
were being followed.

49:58.017 --> 49:59.657
What the hell are you
guys doing together?

49:59.681 --> 50:02.434
Uh, what the hell are you
guys doing together, huh?

50:02.435 --> 50:03.715
We were having a secret meeting,

50:03.716 --> 50:04.996
and it was totally Adam's fault!

50:05.020 --> 50:05.438
Hey.

50:05.438 --> 50:06.406
Aha!

50:06.407 --> 50:07.607
Don't "aha" me.

50:07.608 --> 50:09.341
You guys are together
too, so what's going on?

50:09.342 --> 50:10.782
Well, we were having
a secret meeting

50:10.783 --> 50:11.684
about your secret meeting.

50:11.685 --> 50:12.578
Oh, really?

50:12.579 --> 50:14.099
And how the fuck did
you guys find out?

50:14.123 --> 50:17.049
Because Barrett tweeted,
"Super secret meeting,"

50:17.050 --> 50:18.951
undisclosed location.

50:18.952 --> 50:21.621
"Spy, bad‐ass style."

50:21.622 --> 50:23.856
140 characters, got it in.

50:23.857 --> 50:25.497
Why are you following
me on Twitter still?

50:25.521 --> 50:26.292
We broke up.

50:26.292 --> 50:27.193
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:27.194 --> 50:28.861
We're so broken up.

50:28.862 --> 50:29.862
I trusted you, Adam.

50:29.863 --> 50:30.863
I trusted you!

50:30.864 --> 50:31.732
All right, don't make
that about trust.

50:31.732 --> 50:32.566
No, no, no. ‐No, come on, no.

50:32.567 --> 50:33.699
No, you knew.

50:33.700 --> 50:35.802
You know, know, know,
know, know, know, know.

50:37.539 --> 50:38.539
Hey, hey! Stop!

50:38.539 --> 50:39.339
Look!

50:39.340 --> 50:40.340
Listen!

50:40.341 --> 50:41.774
We all know, know,
know, know, know.

50:41.775 --> 50:42.576
Okay?

50:42.577 --> 50:43.776
But look.

50:43.777 --> 50:45.177
We made a mistake.

50:45.178 --> 50:47.780
But we're all guilty.

50:47.781 --> 50:48.782
Yes.

50:52.219 --> 50:53.219
Yes, yeah, yeah.

50:53.219 --> 50:54.020
Okay

50:54.021 --> 50:55.187
I get you, yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:55.188 --> 50:56.589
All right, so what do we do now?

50:56.590 --> 50:57.990
Well, we don't tell
David about it.

50:57.991 --> 50:59.091
That's for sure.

50:59.092 --> 51:01.661
It's best that David
stays out of it, right?

51:01.662 --> 51:02.662
Right.

51:02.663 --> 51:03.663
Yeah.

51:09.469 --> 51:10.970
You guys do whatever
you gotta do.

51:10.971 --> 51:12.337
Excuse me, boys.

51:12.338 --> 51:13.538
‐Where are you going? ‐Barrett.

51:13.562 --> 51:14.722
Barrett, where are you going?

51:16.644 --> 51:17.644
Oh.

51:17.645 --> 51:19.011
Wow.

51:19.012 --> 51:20.946
Stay strong, guys, you know?

51:20.947 --> 51:23.549
Just‐‐ we don't need
to go in there.

51:23.550 --> 51:25.518
This is wrong.

51:25.519 --> 51:27.520
This is so wrong.

51:27.521 --> 51:28.988
Oh.

51:28.989 --> 51:30.489
Mook.

51:30.490 --> 51:31.591
Barrett,.

51:31.592 --> 51:33.993
I'm gonna walk over
there, man, you know?

51:33.994 --> 51:37.597
Just walk over there,
see what happens.

51:37.598 --> 51:39.899
Howie.

51:39.900 --> 51:41.334
Fuckin'‐‐ Howie.

51:43.970 --> 51:44.970
Oh.

51:53.547 --> 51:54.714
Hey, guys. What's up?

51:54.715 --> 51:55.815
‐Hey. ‐Hi.

51:55.816 --> 51:57.416
I haven't seen you forever.
How you been?

51:57.440 --> 51:58.051
Ugh.

51:58.052 --> 51:59.652
It's good to see
you back together.

51:59.653 --> 52:00.773
Oh, we're not back together.

52:00.797 --> 52:01.522
We're just kinda‐‐.

52:01.523 --> 52:03.022
Nah, no, we just got drunk.

52:03.023 --> 52:06.258
Yeah, I don't know if
I'm‐‐ I'm ready to just

52:06.259 --> 52:07.661
dive back in again, you know?

52:11.297 --> 52:12.698
Okay.

52:12.699 --> 52:17.036
So are we back together again?

52:17.037 --> 52:19.972
Oh, well, well,
well, well, well.

52:19.973 --> 52:21.413
David, this isn't
what it looks like.

52:21.437 --> 52:22.708
Really, Howie?

52:22.709 --> 52:24.544
Because it looks to me like you
guys all went out last night,

52:24.545 --> 52:25.745
got shit hammered,
and now you're

52:25.746 --> 52:27.426
eating breakfast in the
same filthy clothes

52:27.427 --> 52:28.747
you were wearing
the night before.

52:28.771 --> 52:30.449
How did you‐‐ how do
you know we're here?

52:30.450 --> 52:33.819
Well, when you guys broke
up, I got this made up.

52:33.820 --> 52:36.188
Gave it to all the
bars around town.

52:36.189 --> 52:37.023
Really?

52:37.024 --> 52:38.791
I look awesome in this photo.

52:38.792 --> 52:40.492
Yeah, it's a good photo.

52:40.493 --> 52:42.061
Who ratted?

52:42.062 --> 52:43.428
Pretty much all of them.

52:43.429 --> 52:46.131
You guys must have had a
crazy night last night.

52:46.132 --> 52:48.100
And also the fact
that someone texted

52:48.101 --> 52:49.869
me a picture of their scrotum
at 5:00 in the morning

52:49.870 --> 52:51.103
didn't really help matters.

52:51.104 --> 52:51.905
Whose scrotum?

52:51.905 --> 52:52.739
I don't know, Mook.

52:52.740 --> 52:54.173
It wasn't wearing a name tag.

52:54.174 --> 52:55.440
Look, guys.

52:55.441 --> 52:57.710
I understand that
this is hard for you.

52:57.711 --> 52:59.178
Unfortunately, you
all should have

52:59.179 --> 53:00.419
been somewhere else last night.

53:00.443 --> 53:02.715
Do you just carry the
breakup contract

53:02.716 --> 53:03.876
around with you at all times?

53:03.900 --> 53:04.651
It's weird.

53:04.652 --> 53:05.652
It's really weird.

53:05.653 --> 53:06.852
Well, I'm sorry, you guys.

53:06.853 --> 53:08.754
But you have to say goodbye
to fantasy football.

53:08.755 --> 53:11.891
All money will be
refunded immediately.

53:11.892 --> 53:14.359
And unfortunately,
since this all

53:14.360 --> 53:16.440
started with a secret meeting‐‐
thanks for the tweet,

53:16.441 --> 53:17.961
Barrett‐‐ two violations
have occurred.

53:17.985 --> 53:19.198
Come on, dude.

53:19.199 --> 53:21.934
I'm sorry to say the place
on 9th Street is‐‐ is gone.

53:21.935 --> 53:23.603
And I'm going to give
Amanda the jack and jill

53:23.604 --> 53:24.644
party she's always wanted.

53:24.645 --> 53:25.925
I hate when you say those words.

53:25.949 --> 53:26.640
It's discussing.

53:26.641 --> 53:27.907
It's so fucking lame.

53:27.908 --> 53:29.775
Stay away from each
other, I'm telling you

53:29.776 --> 53:32.011
guys, because if I catch
you one more time,

53:32.012 --> 53:34.046
you're gonna be paying
for booze at my wedding,

53:34.047 --> 53:36.081
and fantasy baseball
will disappear.

53:36.082 --> 53:37.917
Oh, you are drunk with power!

53:37.918 --> 53:38.951
You have a problem!

53:38.952 --> 53:40.753
Hey, David, guess what.

53:40.754 --> 53:42.055
That was my scrotum!

53:50.163 --> 53:51.496
Yeah.

53:51.497 --> 53:53.833
Heh.

53:53.834 --> 53:55.434
There you go, bro.

53:55.435 --> 53:57.937
Just‐‐ I'm sorry.

53:57.938 --> 53:58.739
Oh.

53:58.739 --> 53:59.540
I'm sorry.

53:59.541 --> 54:00.873
You‐hoo‐hoo.

54:00.874 --> 54:03.114
I almost marked you down for
too hungover to consider it.

54:03.138 --> 54:04.744
Very funny.

54:04.745 --> 54:06.278
What happened to you last night?

54:06.279 --> 54:07.580
Well, let's see.

54:07.581 --> 54:09.248
I went out with
some girlfriends.

54:09.249 --> 54:12.785
We went drinking and dancing.

54:12.786 --> 54:14.787
And I think I may have
done some more drinking.

54:14.788 --> 54:16.589
I'm not going to Wangers today.

54:16.590 --> 54:17.558
Oh, yeah.

54:17.559 --> 54:20.526
Hey, nobody calls it that.

54:20.527 --> 54:21.694
So you're gonna take it easy?

54:21.695 --> 54:23.596
Yeah, I‐‐ I want
to take it easy.

54:23.597 --> 54:24.597
I could take it easy too.

54:24.598 --> 54:25.598
What are we doing?

54:27.501 --> 54:28.501
What are we doing?

54:28.502 --> 54:29.635
Yeah, me and you.

54:29.636 --> 54:30.970
We're at a park.

54:30.971 --> 54:33.205
They got a lot of cool, like,
trees we could lay under.

54:33.206 --> 54:34.740
We could walk around.

54:34.741 --> 54:36.408
We could go on‐‐ rowboats?

54:36.409 --> 54:37.442
They have rowboats.

54:37.443 --> 54:38.883
Did you know they
have rowboats here?

54:38.907 --> 54:39.612
That's awesome.

54:39.613 --> 54:40.646
Let's do that.

54:40.647 --> 54:41.781
No.

54:41.782 --> 54:43.215
Yeah, for sure.

54:43.216 --> 54:45.518
We're doing it.

54:45.519 --> 54:46.719
I guess it does look like fun.

54:47.354 --> 54:48.354
Aah, fuck!

54:48.355 --> 54:50.022
Ha ha ha!

54:50.023 --> 54:51.857
All right, I think
it's your turn to row.

54:51.858 --> 54:52.593
What?

54:52.594 --> 54:54.560
We just got out here.

54:54.561 --> 54:57.429
I know, but it's like it's
exercise disguised as fun,

54:57.430 --> 54:58.731
and I don't like that.

54:58.732 --> 54:59.666
Oh, guess what.

54:59.667 --> 55:02.167
My dad is a fan of your blog.

55:02.168 --> 55:03.036
Oh.

55:03.037 --> 55:04.469
Cool. You know, it's funny.

55:04.470 --> 55:06.390
I think that a lot of
people are actually reading

55:06.414 --> 55:07.740
my stuff now because of you.

55:07.741 --> 55:10.075
No, they're reading
it because it's good.

55:10.076 --> 55:11.711
But you have to
keep updating it,

55:11.712 --> 55:13.212
and then more people
will read it.

55:13.213 --> 55:16.148
I would, but I got‐‐ like, I'm
really‐‐ I'm just so busy,

55:16.149 --> 55:16.950
you know?

55:16.951 --> 55:18.751
Like I got, like, uh, work.

55:18.752 --> 55:21.486
And now, um, I got this
rowboat hobby that I'm doing.

55:21.487 --> 55:24.256
Um, hey, why don't you
break up with Justin?

55:24.257 --> 55:25.490
I'm sorry, what?

55:25.491 --> 55:27.051
Is it 'cause you‐‐
he's, like, the kinda

55:27.075 --> 55:29.494
guy that doesn't wear a costume
at a Halloween party or what?

55:29.495 --> 55:31.931
No.

55:31.932 --> 55:32.998
Well, kinda.

55:32.999 --> 55:34.499
I don't‐‐ I don't know.

55:34.500 --> 55:35.968
Maybe we could
hang out sometime.

55:35.969 --> 55:37.102
I mean, do you like sushi?

55:37.103 --> 55:38.783
There's a really cool
place that opened up.

55:38.807 --> 55:40.940
I mean, I just broke
up with him last week.

55:40.941 --> 55:42.575
Guess somebody got
you already, huh?

55:42.576 --> 55:43.976
Are you being serious right now?

55:43.977 --> 55:44.977
I am.

55:44.978 --> 55:47.079
I just‐‐ you know,
you're single now.

55:47.080 --> 55:48.814
And I just felt like
it was probably

55:48.815 --> 55:50.449
a good time to get in there.

55:50.450 --> 55:51.617
Not in there.

55:51.618 --> 55:52.553
Not like that.

55:52.554 --> 55:54.219
But, uh, you know.

55:54.220 --> 55:56.488
Ever since I've known
you, you've‐‐ you've just

55:56.489 --> 55:57.623
gone from guy to guy.

55:57.624 --> 55:58.559
Heh‐heh.

55:58.559 --> 55:59.526
I don't mean it like that.

55:59.527 --> 56:00.927
That's a terrible
way to say it too.

56:00.951 --> 56:02.995
Look, I just‐‐ it's
been a long time

56:02.996 --> 56:05.565
since I've done something
like this in the daylight

56:05.566 --> 56:06.899
and just sober.

56:06.900 --> 56:08.580
I've definitely never
done it in a rowboat,

56:08.604 --> 56:10.369
so please cut me some slack.

56:10.370 --> 56:13.238
You know, while you're
not totally off base,

56:13.239 --> 56:17.309
I guess I've‐‐ I've been in
relationship after relationship

56:17.310 --> 56:19.111
ever since college, you know?

56:19.112 --> 56:20.680
And it's‐‐ it's hard
to figure out who

56:20.681 --> 56:22.548
you are as a whole
when you've always

56:22.549 --> 56:24.650
been part of something else.

56:24.651 --> 56:26.385
Does that make any sense?

56:26.386 --> 56:27.486
Yeah.

56:27.487 --> 56:29.755
Uh, I mean, it makes
total sense, you know?

56:29.756 --> 56:31.857
That's why I broke
up with my friends.

56:31.858 --> 56:33.759
With your friends?

56:33.760 --> 56:36.361
It's just a stupid thing
that we're doing, you know?

56:36.362 --> 56:37.362
Oh, I get it.

56:37.363 --> 56:38.803
That's where you're
playing kickball.

56:38.827 --> 56:39.765
You're on the rebound.

56:39.766 --> 56:41.200
Heh‐heh.

56:41.201 --> 56:44.169
So listen, I‐‐ I didn't‐‐ I
didn't mean to screw this up.

56:44.170 --> 56:47.372
I'm just‐‐ look, I like‐‐ I
like hanging out with you.

56:47.373 --> 56:49.942
And I like talking
to you about stuff.

56:49.943 --> 56:52.778
And I just figure, I don't know.

56:52.779 --> 56:54.747
Hey, look, we're both in
the same boat, right?

56:54.748 --> 56:55.582
Oh, my god.

56:55.583 --> 56:56.782
I know, that was super corny.

56:56.783 --> 56:58.784
Even when I said it, I knew
it was too much, but‐‐.

56:58.785 --> 56:59.785
Oh, my god, Adam.

56:59.786 --> 57:02.788
There is a guy
masturbating over there!

57:02.789 --> 57:03.690
‐Holy shit. ‐Oh.

57:03.690 --> 57:04.558
Oh.

57:04.559 --> 57:05.759
‐You dropped the oars? ‐Paddle.

57:05.783 --> 57:06.783
Paddle, paddle.

57:08.762 --> 57:11.296
Hey, you guys.

57:11.297 --> 57:12.232
How you doing?

57:12.233 --> 57:13.799
Uh, pretty good.

57:13.800 --> 57:15.167
How are you, man?

57:15.168 --> 57:17.670
I'm great.

57:17.671 --> 57:20.472
You look like a cute couple.

57:20.473 --> 57:22.141
How long you been together?

57:22.142 --> 57:23.942
We're not really going
out together, you know?

57:23.966 --> 57:26.345
We just have a, um‐‐
she's not really ready.

57:26.346 --> 57:27.280
She's, uh‐‐

57:27.281 --> 57:28.380
I'm not‐‐ I'm not ready.

57:28.381 --> 57:31.450
So, um, we can‐‐.

57:31.451 --> 57:33.619
Timing is everything.

57:33.620 --> 57:36.055
When I first moved
out here in my 20s,

57:36.056 --> 57:39.024
I wanted to go out every night
and paint the town red.

57:39.025 --> 57:41.493
I was dating this girl.

57:41.494 --> 57:44.229
Her idea of a perfect evening
was to stay home with a bottle

57:44.230 --> 57:47.833
of wine, listen to Johnny Cash.

57:47.834 --> 57:48.635
Now I'm older.

57:48.635 --> 57:49.435
Oh, god.

57:49.436 --> 57:52.271
And that's all I want to do.

57:52.272 --> 57:55.207
Mm.

57:55.208 --> 58:00.079
That girl‐‐ she's long gone.

58:00.080 --> 58:01.080
She was the right girl.

58:03.584 --> 58:04.584
Just the wrong time.

58:10.023 --> 58:11.824
That's really sad, man.

58:11.825 --> 58:13.358
That's sad, huh?

58:13.359 --> 58:14.794
Adam, move the boat!

58:14.795 --> 58:16.161
Oh, hey. Uh, yeah.

58:16.162 --> 58:17.396
Thanks, man.

58:17.397 --> 58:19.164
Uh, so we‐‐ we probably got
to get out of here, so‐‐.

58:19.165 --> 58:19.966
You need a hand?

58:19.966 --> 58:20.767
Oh, no, thanks.

58:20.768 --> 58:22.034
No‐‐ no hands.

58:22.035 --> 58:24.075
Wow, so this guy was just
whacking it in plain view?

58:24.099 --> 58:24.705
Tastes amazing.

58:24.706 --> 58:25.938
Yeah, he was just

58:25.939 --> 58:28.741
standing there thumbing his
dick, like, all casually

58:28.742 --> 58:29.822
like he was reading a book.

58:29.846 --> 58:30.744
Wow.

58:30.745 --> 58:32.065
You have to admire
that, you know?

58:32.089 --> 58:33.813
Just to be so free.

58:33.814 --> 58:34.615
I can't imagine.

58:34.616 --> 58:35.896
I could never do that, you know?

58:35.920 --> 58:36.849
And I'm engaged now.

58:36.850 --> 58:38.490
That's probably one
thing that I can't do.

58:38.491 --> 58:40.893
You know, jerk off in public‐‐
I probably can't do that.

58:40.894 --> 58:43.322
Are you nervous about
the wedding, man?

58:43.323 --> 58:44.957
No, not at all.

58:44.958 --> 58:45.892
Why? I mean, maybe a little.

58:45.892 --> 58:46.693
Why?

58:46.694 --> 58:47.927
Where are you?

58:47.928 --> 58:49.294
Um, I'm actually gonna pick
up some food right now.

58:49.295 --> 58:51.455
Do you want me to bring home
dinner for you and Amanda?

58:51.479 --> 58:52.198
Uh, no, no.

58:52.199 --> 58:54.233
We're watching our weight.

58:54.234 --> 58:55.635
Mm!

58:55.636 --> 58:58.156
And‐‐ and hey, could‐‐ could you
actually not come home tonight?

58:58.180 --> 59:00.606
Yeah, it's just, we could kinda
use the place to ourselves‐‐

59:00.607 --> 59:01.807
just the two of us, you know?

59:01.808 --> 59:03.408
Oh, you're such a romantic.

59:03.409 --> 59:05.144
Yeah, I'll just‐‐
I'll stay in my room.

59:05.145 --> 59:06.445
No, seriously, man.

59:06.446 --> 59:08.566
We haven't‐‐ we haven't had
sex since you've moved in.

59:08.590 --> 59:09.414
It's the truth.

59:09.415 --> 59:10.850
She can't do it knowing that
you're in the next room.

59:10.851 --> 59:12.411
So please? Just don't
come home tonight.

59:12.435 --> 59:13.586
Just please don't, you know?

59:13.587 --> 59:15.454
Or just do something else.

59:15.455 --> 59:17.015
Well, what the hell
am I supposed to do?

59:17.016 --> 59:18.376
I can't even hang
out with anybody.

59:18.400 --> 59:19.291
No, Adam.

59:19.292 --> 59:20.793
You're not allowed to hang
out with three guys, okay?

59:20.794 --> 59:22.695
So just do something,
anything, please.

59:22.696 --> 59:23.796
I can't talk right now.

59:23.797 --> 59:25.297
I'm in the middle of some really

59:25.298 --> 59:26.458
important wedding shit, okay?

59:26.482 --> 59:28.400
Babe, the rocky road one?

59:28.401 --> 59:29.802
Marshmallows in cake?

59:29.803 --> 59:30.671
Don't come home.

59:30.671 --> 59:31.671
All right.

59:44.217 --> 59:46.652
Oh, god damn!

59:46.653 --> 59:48.487
Adam fucking Bomb, man.

59:48.488 --> 59:50.255
It is so good to have you, man.

59:50.256 --> 59:51.057
Thanks for calling.

59:51.058 --> 59:52.391
Yeah, thanks for having me.

59:52.392 --> 59:53.726
Hey, do you want of this?

59:53.727 --> 59:54.994
Uh, oh, no, thank you.

59:54.995 --> 59:55.796
I'm good.

59:55.796 --> 59:56.763
It's cocaine.

59:56.764 --> 59:57.930
No, no, I definitely
know what it is.

59:57.931 --> 59:59.331
But I don't‐‐ ‐You
don't do cocaine?

59:59.332 --> 01:00:00.772
You don't want some of this?
‐I know.

01:00:00.796 --> 01:00:01.467
Shh.

01:00:01.467 --> 01:00:02.402
Don't‐‐ I‐‐ I'm all good.

01:00:02.403 --> 01:00:03.403
Thank you.

01:00:03.404 --> 01:00:05.070
This place is fucking
awesome, right?

01:00:05.071 --> 01:00:05.872
Yeah, it's pretty good.

01:00:05.872 --> 01:00:06.707
That's Andrea.

01:00:06.708 --> 01:00:07.873
She's a model.

01:00:07.874 --> 01:00:09.141
Very cool.

01:00:09.142 --> 01:00:10.776
I don't know what she models,
but her skin is amazing.

01:00:10.777 --> 01:00:11.578
Touch it.

01:00:11.578 --> 01:00:12.412
Oh, no, I can see it.

01:00:12.412 --> 01:00:13.379
That's‐‐ that's nice.

01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:14.540
No, no, no, she doesn't mind.

01:00:14.541 --> 01:00:15.781
Go ahead, touch her skin. ‐Okay.

01:00:15.805 --> 01:00:17.249
No, don't pat it.
Like, touch it.

01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:18.530
‐Oh, like‐‐ ‐Yeah, get in there.

01:00:18.554 --> 01:00:19.552
Yeah. ‐Okay.

01:00:19.553 --> 01:00:20.620
Okay.

01:00:20.621 --> 01:00:22.221
Honestly, after seeing
someone like her,

01:00:22.222 --> 01:00:24.423
I understand why you would
cut somebody else's skin

01:00:24.424 --> 01:00:25.791
off and wear it as your own.

01:00:25.792 --> 01:00:26.859
Oh, my god!

01:00:26.860 --> 01:00:28.060
No, don't worry about it, man.

01:00:28.061 --> 01:00:29.301
I'm not actually gonna do that.

01:00:29.325 --> 01:00:29.796
Yeah, good!

01:00:29.796 --> 01:00:30.597
Look, man.

01:00:30.598 --> 01:00:31.931
Be fucking cool, all right?

01:00:31.932 --> 01:00:32.932
This is my joint.

01:00:32.933 --> 01:00:34.133
Okay

01:00:34.134 --> 01:00:36.501
I'll‐‐ I'll just‐‐ I'll
be calm from here on out.

01:00:36.502 --> 01:00:37.742
I'm just fucking with you, man.

01:00:37.766 --> 01:00:38.904
‐Ha. ‐I got you.

01:00:38.905 --> 01:00:39.840
Oh, you got me?

01:00:39.841 --> 01:00:41.240
I got you, Adam Bomb, man!

01:00:41.241 --> 01:00:42.208
Let's do a lap.

01:00:42.208 --> 01:00:43.208
Okay.

01:00:45.311 --> 01:00:47.179
Just like old times, right?

01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:48.380
Yeah, kinda.

01:00:48.381 --> 01:00:50.381
I mean, we didn't really
hang out that much, but‐‐.

01:00:50.405 --> 01:00:51.183
Hey.

01:00:51.184 --> 01:00:53.704
Do you remember that time senior year, Mr.
York's physics class?

01:00:53.728 --> 01:00:56.556
I stole that answer key, copied
it, and gave it to everybody.

01:00:56.557 --> 01:00:59.058
And it turns out it was from,
like, three years before.

01:00:59.059 --> 01:01:02.795
And we all failed, and that
one Asian kid killed himself?

01:01:02.796 --> 01:01:03.796
Yeah.

01:01:03.797 --> 01:01:05.931
I can't get that kid
out of my head.

01:01:05.932 --> 01:01:08.568
That kid still haunts my dreams.

01:01:08.569 --> 01:01:10.269
Do you remember his name?

01:01:10.270 --> 01:01:12.404
Uh, no.

01:01:12.405 --> 01:01:13.739
It was Daniel Fu.

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:15.074
How do you forget that?

01:01:15.075 --> 01:01:17.409
Oh, right.

01:01:17.410 --> 01:01:19.512
Do you remember his face?

01:01:19.513 --> 01:01:20.346
Yeah.

01:01:20.347 --> 01:01:21.587
I remember what he looked like.

01:01:21.611 --> 01:01:22.615
Okay

01:01:22.616 --> 01:01:23.616
I do too.

01:01:23.617 --> 01:01:25.017
Daniel Fu‐‐ now I
remember his name.

01:01:25.041 --> 01:01:26.185
Daniel Fu.

01:01:26.186 --> 01:01:27.520
God damn it, I miss high school.

01:01:27.521 --> 01:01:29.088
I fucking ruled that place.

01:01:29.089 --> 01:01:30.489
Yeah.

01:01:30.490 --> 01:01:32.825
This one's for you, Fu.

01:01:32.826 --> 01:01:34.628
I'll never go away.

01:01:37.497 --> 01:01:39.865
Hey, bitches love
dancing, right?

01:01:39.866 --> 01:01:40.966
Yeah, yeah, they do.

01:01:40.967 --> 01:01:42.367
Hey, here's the thing.

01:01:42.368 --> 01:01:45.905
I don't want you to fuck any
of these girls, all right?

01:01:45.906 --> 01:01:47.707
You're definitely
going to get hep C.

01:01:47.708 --> 01:01:48.774
‐Huh. ‐I'm just kidding.

01:01:48.775 --> 01:01:49.576
Oh.

01:01:49.577 --> 01:01:51.577
You can fuck them.

01:01:51.578 --> 01:01:53.112
Hep C is treatable
with antibiotics.

01:01:53.113 --> 01:01:54.379
Either way, you know?

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:55.581
Don't worry about it.

01:01:55.582 --> 01:01:56.916
You're not going to get any
ass dressed like this.

01:01:56.917 --> 01:01:58.397
You look like a bag
of wet sandwiches.

01:01:58.421 --> 01:01:59.152
Oh.

01:01:59.153 --> 01:02:00.385
Uh, that's so rude.

01:02:00.386 --> 01:02:01.821
But, uh, it's my favorite shirt.

01:02:01.822 --> 01:02:03.262
It's got a collar
and everything, so.

01:02:03.286 --> 01:02:03.890
Really?

01:02:03.891 --> 01:02:06.959
This shirt cost $600.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.695
$600, that shirt?

01:02:09.696 --> 01:02:12.216
That's a‐‐ I mean, I don't even
know how that could‐‐ wow, okay?

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:12.966
Fuck you.

01:02:12.966 --> 01:02:13.800
Yeah, that's really soft.

01:02:13.801 --> 01:02:14.841
That's amazing how soft‐‐.

01:02:14.842 --> 01:02:16.202
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
stop touching me.

01:02:16.226 --> 01:02:17.537
Okay

01:02:17.538 --> 01:02:20.372
I feel like you led me to that.

01:02:20.373 --> 01:02:22.241
So how are you supposed
to talk to girls here?

01:02:22.242 --> 01:02:23.776
It's so loud.

01:02:23.777 --> 01:02:26.345
God, you're not supposed
to be talking at all.

01:02:26.346 --> 01:02:28.247
You just have to have
well‐defined cheekbones

01:02:28.248 --> 01:02:29.381
and a shitload of money.

01:02:29.382 --> 01:02:30.583
Ah.

01:02:30.584 --> 01:02:33.285
Or you have to play for
the Lakers like that guy.

01:02:33.286 --> 01:02:34.453
I don't really think that guy

01:02:34.454 --> 01:02:35.654
actually plays for the Lakers.

01:02:35.678 --> 01:02:37.156
He's just‐‐ maybe
just a black guy

01:02:37.157 --> 01:02:38.390
that bought a‐‐ a windbreaker.

01:02:38.391 --> 01:02:39.592
But yeah.

01:02:39.593 --> 01:02:40.660
I get what you're saying.

01:02:40.661 --> 01:02:42.562
Oh, they could sure
use them, huh?

01:02:42.563 --> 01:02:43.896
Yeah, true that.

01:02:43.897 --> 01:02:48.500
The Lakers man‐‐ they flop worse than M.
Night Shyamalan.

01:02:48.501 --> 01:02:49.581
Hey, where'd you hear that?

01:02:49.605 --> 01:02:50.403
I wrote that.

01:02:50.403 --> 01:02:51.204
Really?

01:02:51.204 --> 01:02:52.138
Yeah.

01:02:52.138 --> 01:02:52.973
No shit.

01:02:52.974 --> 01:02:54.439
My roommate sent me that link.

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:55.440
I should introduce you.

01:02:55.441 --> 01:02:56.876
He works for Yahoo.

01:02:56.877 --> 01:02:58.143
They're looking for writers.

01:02:58.144 --> 01:02:58.945
Really?

01:02:58.946 --> 01:03:00.546
Which one's your roommate?

01:03:00.547 --> 01:03:02.848
He's that old guy trying
to party like he's 22.

01:03:02.849 --> 01:03:06.051
Let's do some molly,
motherfuckers!

01:03:06.052 --> 01:03:06.853
Woo!

01:03:06.854 --> 01:03:08.253
I feel amazing!

01:03:08.254 --> 01:03:09.321
Hey, you know what?

01:03:09.322 --> 01:03:10.442
I'll connect you guys later.

01:03:10.466 --> 01:03:11.524
Don't worry about it.

01:03:11.525 --> 01:03:12.625
Oh, shit!

01:03:12.626 --> 01:03:14.459
This is our song, bros!

01:03:14.460 --> 01:03:15.261
Let's go, Jim.

01:03:15.261 --> 01:03:16.261
Let's go!

01:03:18.966 --> 01:03:19.966
God.

01:03:19.967 --> 01:03:24.436
That's‐‐ that's so exhausting.

01:03:24.437 --> 01:03:25.470
All right, motherfuckers.

01:03:25.471 --> 01:03:26.839
It's that time o' night.

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:28.340
Hand in your credit cards.

01:03:28.341 --> 01:03:29.142
What do we do?

01:03:29.143 --> 01:03:30.242
We just split it up, yeah?

01:03:30.243 --> 01:03:31.603
Split it‐‐ yeah,
that's what we do.

01:03:31.627 --> 01:03:32.345
No, bro.

01:03:32.346 --> 01:03:33.646
We play credit card roulette.

01:03:33.647 --> 01:03:37.116
We let the young lady to
my left decide who is

01:03:37.117 --> 01:03:40.485
the richest among us tonight.

01:03:40.486 --> 01:03:42.522
Oh, the new guy!

01:03:42.523 --> 01:03:44.089
New guy has to pay
for everything!

01:03:44.090 --> 01:03:44.925
Welcome to the circle!

01:03:44.926 --> 01:03:46.091
‐Adam Bomb! ‐Okay.

01:03:46.092 --> 01:03:47.159
All right.

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:48.760
‐That can't be too bad, right?
‐Oh, yeah.

01:03:48.761 --> 01:03:50.241
You got to pay for,
what, six bottles?

01:03:50.265 --> 01:03:52.197
Yeah, 2 grand‐‐ not even.

01:03:52.198 --> 01:03:54.133
2 grand?

01:03:54.134 --> 01:03:54.935
You're fucking serious?

01:03:54.936 --> 01:03:56.335
Bro, do me a favor.

01:03:56.336 --> 01:03:57.369
Tip her well.

01:03:57.370 --> 01:03:58.904
She's coming back
to the after‐party.

01:03:58.905 --> 01:04:01.440
Let's rock and roll, my place!

01:04:01.441 --> 01:04:02.875
Awesome hanging out
with you, man.

01:04:02.876 --> 01:04:03.710
We got to do this more.

01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:04.710
Let's go.

01:04:11.785 --> 01:04:14.353
So dude, thanks for giving
us the place last night.

01:04:14.354 --> 01:04:16.822
But Amanda came up with this
amazing idea during dinner.

01:04:16.823 --> 01:04:17.791
What?

01:04:17.792 --> 01:04:19.192
Since we haven't had
sex in so long,

01:04:19.216 --> 01:04:20.960
we save ourselves for
our wedding night

01:04:20.961 --> 01:04:22.094
to make it more
special, you know?

01:04:22.095 --> 01:04:23.162
I think it's pretty cool.

01:04:23.163 --> 01:04:24.443
That sounds like
a terrible idea.

01:04:24.444 --> 01:04:25.978
I think it's a great
idea, because it's

01:04:25.979 --> 01:04:27.499
like I'm a virgin again now.

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:28.500
You're not a virgin.

01:04:28.501 --> 01:04:29.535
You're a dude that
doesn't have sex,

01:04:29.536 --> 01:04:30.636
and there's a lot
of those out there.

01:04:30.637 --> 01:04:32.317
All right, well, you
can agree to disagree.

01:04:32.341 --> 01:04:33.539
I think it's a great idea.

01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:34.974
So anyway, how are you doing?

01:04:34.975 --> 01:04:37.109
Well, I miss fantasy
football more than I

01:04:37.110 --> 01:04:38.310
miss our dead grandmother.

01:04:38.311 --> 01:04:40.191
I had a nightmare the other
night about a summer

01:04:40.215 --> 01:04:41.346
without fantasy baseball.

01:04:41.347 --> 01:04:42.548
That was terrible.

01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:44.509
Other than that, I totally
think that this breakup

01:04:44.533 --> 01:04:45.185
was a mistake.

01:04:45.186 --> 01:04:46.752
First of all, Nana
would be crushed

01:04:46.753 --> 01:04:48.020
if she heard you say that.

01:04:48.021 --> 01:04:49.989
And the breakup was
not a bad idea, okay?

01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:50.990
You needed this.

01:04:50.991 --> 01:04:51.925
So how are the other guys?

01:04:51.925 --> 01:04:52.726
They're good.

01:04:52.727 --> 01:04:54.059
They're good.

01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:56.300
Uh, Barrett enrolled in a
couple of night classes at USC,

01:04:56.324 --> 01:04:56.730
actually.

01:04:56.731 --> 01:04:57.971
He's killing it with the girls.

01:04:57.995 --> 01:04:59.565
Mook calls me a lot, actually.

01:04:59.566 --> 01:05:01.086
I don't know what his
deal is, but he's

01:05:01.110 --> 01:05:02.234
taking some sort of class.

01:05:02.235 --> 01:05:03.069
I don't know.

01:05:03.070 --> 01:05:04.570
He wasn't really specific.

01:05:04.571 --> 01:05:06.071
Howie emailed me.

01:05:06.072 --> 01:05:08.107
He got a promotion,
I think, at work.

01:05:08.108 --> 01:05:10.409
And he's dating someone
who's got a kid.

01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:11.211
Okay, great.

01:05:11.211 --> 01:05:12.078
So I'm in last place.

01:05:12.079 --> 01:05:15.080
Dude, this is not a race.

01:05:15.081 --> 01:05:16.281
What?

01:05:16.282 --> 01:05:17.650
Nothing.

01:05:17.651 --> 01:05:19.585
This guy is measuring my inner
thigh, and I think it moved.

01:05:19.586 --> 01:05:20.666
Oh, so you're‐‐ you're gay.

01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:21.454
Oh, really?

01:05:21.455 --> 01:05:22.588
I'm gay?

01:05:22.589 --> 01:05:23.889
I'm in a committed
relationship, and you just

01:05:23.890 --> 01:05:25.257
broke up with a bunch of dudes.
How am I gay?

01:05:25.258 --> 01:05:26.192
You're in a committed
relationship,

01:05:26.192 --> 01:05:27.127
but you won't have
sex with a girl.

01:05:27.128 --> 01:05:28.408
I'm in a committed relationship,

01:05:28.409 --> 01:05:30.177
but I'm choosing not to
have sex with a girl.

01:05:30.178 --> 01:05:31.430
How is that gay?

01:05:31.431 --> 01:05:32.232
That's actually so gay.

01:05:32.232 --> 01:05:33.066
That's so gay.

01:05:33.067 --> 01:05:34.500
Yeah, I totally got that, yeah.

01:05:35.501 --> 01:05:36.501
Oh.

01:05:51.084 --> 01:05:52.952
I thought we were going
to keep pretending

01:05:52.953 --> 01:05:54.153
that exercising was fun.

01:05:54.154 --> 01:05:56.922
You can't go jogging in that.

01:05:56.923 --> 01:05:59.058
I honestly thought
you were joking.

01:05:59.059 --> 01:06:01.895
This outfit is not ironic.

01:06:02.796 --> 01:06:03.916
So what are we gonna do now?

01:06:06.333 --> 01:06:07.333
You know what?

01:06:07.334 --> 01:06:08.433
You were right.

01:06:08.434 --> 01:06:10.114
This is a way better
idea than working out.

01:06:10.138 --> 01:06:11.170
Yeah.

01:06:11.171 --> 01:06:12.337
Stick with me, and you'll
be out of shape in no time.

01:06:12.338 --> 01:06:13.239
‐I got it, I got it! ‐Oh.

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:14.439
‐Oh. ‐Hey.

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:15.408
You all right?

01:06:15.408 --> 01:06:16.408
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

01:06:25.186 --> 01:06:26.186
Adam.

01:06:26.187 --> 01:06:27.653
What?

01:06:27.654 --> 01:06:31.591
We should probably stop.

01:06:31.592 --> 01:06:35.127
I mean, you know, uh,
we don't have to stop.

01:06:35.128 --> 01:06:39.131
I just‐‐ I don't want to
screw things up, you know?

01:06:39.132 --> 01:06:41.332
Well, for the record, I don't
think it screws things up.

01:06:41.356 --> 01:06:43.435
I think it makes
things way better.

01:06:43.436 --> 01:06:46.939
I just‐‐ I just don't think
it's the right time.

01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:47.808
Really?

01:06:47.809 --> 01:06:49.274
You're single for once.

01:06:49.275 --> 01:06:51.210
Technically, it's like
the perfect time.

01:06:51.211 --> 01:06:54.379
Yeah, but it doesn't
feel that way to me.

01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:56.716
Can't we just, you know,
continue to hang out as friends

01:06:56.717 --> 01:06:58.751
and see where it
goes from there?

01:06:58.752 --> 01:07:01.153
I'm just‐‐ I'm not ready
for more than that.

01:07:01.154 --> 01:07:02.622
Well I am.

01:07:02.623 --> 01:07:04.356
Are you sure?

01:07:04.357 --> 01:07:06.125
I think you need time
to figure things out.

01:07:06.126 --> 01:07:09.161
And I just‐‐ I just need you
to give me some time too.

01:07:09.162 --> 01:07:09.930
Oh, I will.

01:07:09.931 --> 01:07:11.230
I‐‐ I totally will.

01:07:11.231 --> 01:07:12.598
I think that time is great.

01:07:12.599 --> 01:07:15.367
But I think that that thing that
we just did where we kissed

01:07:15.368 --> 01:07:17.069
is also awesome.

01:07:17.070 --> 01:07:20.305
And I think that while
we're taking that time,

01:07:20.306 --> 01:07:24.009
we can continue to hang
out and do cool things.

01:07:24.010 --> 01:07:26.245
And every now and then,
I'll kiss you, and‐‐

01:07:26.246 --> 01:07:28.681
Adam, look.

01:07:28.682 --> 01:07:31.584
I just can't be at the top
of your list right now.

01:07:31.585 --> 01:07:33.754
I'm‐‐ I'm sorry, but
that's where I'm at.

01:07:36.991 --> 01:07:38.111
Well, it's not where I'm at.

01:07:38.135 --> 01:07:39.135
I want more than that.

01:07:54.809 --> 01:07:55.809
Hey, Adam.

01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:56.909
Uh, sorry to bother you.

01:07:56.910 --> 01:07:58.510
But I was thinking
about putting together

01:07:58.534 --> 01:08:00.880
a presentation regarding
the NNL's ability to‐‐

01:08:00.881 --> 01:08:02.782
I'm in love.

01:08:02.783 --> 01:08:04.016
Dude, her name is Stephanie.

01:08:04.017 --> 01:08:05.817
And I know we're not
supposed to say anything,

01:08:05.818 --> 01:08:07.152
but I had to tell somebody.

01:08:07.153 --> 01:08:07.688
Wow.

01:08:07.689 --> 01:08:08.788
Where'd you meet her?

01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:11.991
Uh, just this class
where we learn things.

01:08:11.992 --> 01:08:13.559
You know, books and shit.

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:15.280
Uh, anyway you'll get
to meet her at David's

01:08:15.304 --> 01:08:16.629
stupid jack and jill party.

01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:17.430
Yeah, cool.

01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:18.564
I'll get to meet your girl.

01:08:18.564 --> 01:08:20.444
I'll get to meet Howie's
girl and maybe her kid.

01:08:20.469 --> 01:08:22.100
I'll get to meet, uh,
Barrett's girls.

01:08:22.102 --> 01:08:23.542
I'll sure he'll have
a few hot coeds,

01:08:23.542 --> 01:08:24.863
'cause he's the big
man on campus.

01:08:24.886 --> 01:08:26.438
It'll be a fucking
great night for me.

01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:27.639
Dude, are you doing all right?

01:08:27.662 --> 01:08:28.573
Yeah, I'm great.

01:08:28.575 --> 01:08:29.375
Never been better.

01:08:29.375 --> 01:08:30.276
I still don't have a girl.

01:08:30.277 --> 01:08:31.310
I'm broke as shit.

01:08:31.310 --> 01:08:33.078
I'm sleeping on a
pull‐out mattress.

01:08:33.078 --> 01:08:34.479
And at any given
moment, I'm worried

01:08:34.502 --> 01:08:37.049
that a condom broke and I might
have a litter of tiger cubs.

01:08:37.050 --> 01:08:39.417
Uh, I don't know what
that last part means.

01:08:39.419 --> 01:08:40.553
But it can't be all bad.

01:08:40.554 --> 01:08:42.220
No, no, no, no, no, it's not.

01:08:42.221 --> 01:08:46.626
A guy at Yahoo who happens to
be a raging fucking coke head

01:08:46.627 --> 01:08:49.328
told me he might read an
article I wrote on the 49ers.

01:08:49.328 --> 01:08:50.162
Hey, Adam.

01:08:50.163 --> 01:08:51.531
I just have a quick question.

01:08:51.532 --> 01:08:52.997
Hey, Jamie, what's up?

01:08:52.999 --> 01:08:53.999
Yeah, listen.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.568
Barrett's just an
enigma of the man,

01:08:55.569 --> 01:08:56.769
and he's playing hard to get.

01:08:56.770 --> 01:08:57.870
Oh.

01:08:57.871 --> 01:08:59.470
I knew it.

01:08:59.471 --> 01:09:01.841
I was totally gonna
tell you that.

01:09:01.841 --> 01:09:02.776
Shit.

01:09:02.777 --> 01:09:04.009
Hey, uh, Mr. Richtman.

01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:04.810
What is this?

01:09:04.812 --> 01:09:05.812
Yeah, I know.

01:09:05.812 --> 01:09:06.779
Look, I want to
apologize about that.

01:09:06.779 --> 01:09:07.714
I know I left that in there.

01:09:07.715 --> 01:09:09.148
This is really good.

01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:09.950
You wrote this?

01:09:09.950 --> 01:09:10.783
Yeah.

01:09:10.785 --> 01:09:12.518
I had no idea you were a writer.

01:09:12.519 --> 01:09:13.486
I want to read more.

01:09:13.487 --> 01:09:15.287
Where are the
articles on lacrosse?

01:09:15.287 --> 01:09:16.756
Uh, well, there aren't any.

01:09:16.756 --> 01:09:18.823
Nobody cares about lacrosse.

01:09:18.825 --> 01:09:20.024
What?

01:09:20.026 --> 01:09:21.426
You've been here
longer than I have.

01:09:21.426 --> 01:09:22.587
I thought you loved lacrosse.

01:09:22.611 --> 01:09:23.196
Me?

01:09:23.197 --> 01:09:24.429
No.

01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:25.765
Honestly, I thought you were
the only one around here

01:09:25.765 --> 01:09:26.999
that cared about lacrosse?

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.100
What are you doing here if
you don't like lacrosse?

01:09:29.102 --> 01:09:30.102
I don't know.

01:09:30.103 --> 01:09:31.737
It's my job.

01:09:31.738 --> 01:09:33.839
Oh, no.

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:38.010
You're talking to me like a
guy who wants me to fire him.

01:09:38.011 --> 01:09:41.647
No, I‐‐ I think that that
is maybe what I want.

01:09:41.648 --> 01:09:42.915
Actually, no.

01:09:42.916 --> 01:09:44.316
I‐‐ look, I don't
want to get fired.

01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:45.051
Don't fire me.

01:09:45.051 --> 01:09:46.051
Okay.

01:09:46.053 --> 01:09:47.553
Good, I've never fired
anybody before.

01:09:47.554 --> 01:09:49.154
I mean, if I were
you, I would fire me.

01:09:49.154 --> 01:09:51.156
I mean, you know how long it
took me to do my work today?

01:09:51.157 --> 01:09:52.658
A full day's work, I did
it in a half an hour,

01:09:52.658 --> 01:09:53.759
and I wasn't even trying.

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:55.394
‐How is it even possible?
‐I don't know.

01:09:55.395 --> 01:09:56.475
It's just so easy. I mean‐‐.

01:09:56.476 --> 01:09:57.444
All right, wait. I'm confused.

01:09:57.445 --> 01:09:59.331
Do you want me to
fire you or not?

01:09:59.332 --> 01:10:00.612
No, I don't want you to fire me.

01:10:00.613 --> 01:10:02.133
I just‐‐ I don't want
to lose that too.

01:10:02.157 --> 01:10:03.536
That's my job. ‐Good.

01:10:03.537 --> 01:10:04.817
All right, so I'm
not firing you.

01:10:04.841 --> 01:10:05.771
Okay.

01:10:05.772 --> 01:10:06.540
Why not?

01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:07.473
Ugh!

01:10:07.474 --> 01:10:09.909
Look, I just‐‐ you want somebody

01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:10.877
that wants to be here, right?

01:10:10.878 --> 01:10:12.512
And I don't want to be here.

01:10:12.513 --> 01:10:14.447
I mean, I have to
move on with my life.

01:10:16.382 --> 01:10:17.583
But seriously, don't fire me.

01:10:17.584 --> 01:10:18.784
I don't want to get fired.

01:10:18.785 --> 01:10:20.185
Oh, god.

01:10:20.186 --> 01:10:22.121
All right, Adam.

01:10:22.122 --> 01:10:22.923
You're fired.

01:10:22.924 --> 01:10:24.289
I'm coming with ya!

01:10:24.290 --> 01:10:25.424
Mook, hold on.

01:10:25.425 --> 01:10:26.259
No.

01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:29.462
Just‐‐ it's against the rules.

01:10:31.765 --> 01:10:34.399
Wow, this is emotional.

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:35.835
Come on.

01:10:35.836 --> 01:10:38.370
No, I just never
fired a guy before.

01:10:38.371 --> 01:10:39.705
Okay.

01:10:39.706 --> 01:10:41.040
Are we good?

01:10:41.041 --> 01:10:42.642
‐Yeah, we're good. ‐Okay.

01:10:42.643 --> 01:10:43.963
You're still fired
and we're good?

01:10:43.987 --> 01:10:46.646
I'm fired and it's all good.

01:10:46.647 --> 01:10:48.180
Great.

01:10:48.181 --> 01:10:50.049
That felt good.

01:10:50.050 --> 01:10:51.584
Who's next?

01:10:51.585 --> 01:10:53.319
Lyle, meet me in my office.

01:10:57.958 --> 01:10:59.478
Mook, you bring a
plant and a keyboard?

01:10:59.502 --> 01:11:01.370
Really?

01:11:02.356 --> 01:11:03.996
We were gonna‐‐ you
were gonna talk first.

01:11:03.997 --> 01:11:04.665
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:11:04.665 --> 01:11:05.632
Yeah.

01:11:05.633 --> 01:11:07.066
I'm sorry.

01:11:07.067 --> 01:11:09.387
They're all sitting in a circle,
and they're looking at us.

01:11:09.411 --> 01:11:10.270
Um.

01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:11.071
Hi.

01:11:11.072 --> 01:11:12.271
Hello, everyone.

01:11:12.272 --> 01:11:16.475
Thank you for coming to
our jack and jill party.

01:11:16.476 --> 01:11:18.544
I'm Jack, heh‐heh.

01:11:18.545 --> 01:11:19.912
Jill.

01:11:19.913 --> 01:11:22.682
We have a lot of really fun
games that we're going to play.

01:11:22.683 --> 01:11:23.983
Don't we, David?

01:11:23.984 --> 01:11:24.785
Yes.

01:11:24.785 --> 01:11:25.586
Yes, we do.

01:11:25.587 --> 01:11:27.720
Um, we have Dirty Taboo.

01:11:27.721 --> 01:11:32.224
We have, um, Truth or Dare
Jenga, which should be fun.

01:11:32.225 --> 01:11:36.829
Um, we also have
Naughty Pictionary.

01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:38.531
We have Uno, which is
just a great game.

01:11:38.532 --> 01:11:40.199
Uh, heh.

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.334
Dominoes, where we
could just kinda

01:11:42.335 --> 01:11:46.739
line them up and see what, you
know, uh, we could flick them.

01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:47.740
What the fuck?

01:11:50.176 --> 01:11:52.411
I think this was a
pretty bad idea.

01:11:52.412 --> 01:11:54.479
You guys, you look
totally miserable.

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:55.480
Are you?

01:11:59.252 --> 01:12:00.553
Okay.

01:12:00.554 --> 01:12:01.687
New plan.

01:12:01.688 --> 01:12:04.890
Ladies, you guys
all come with me.

01:12:04.891 --> 01:12:06.091
We're going to go to a club.

01:12:06.092 --> 01:12:06.860
Okay?

01:12:06.861 --> 01:12:08.594
Guys, you stay here.

01:12:08.595 --> 01:12:10.730
Have your bachelor party.

01:12:10.731 --> 01:12:11.632
Get crazy.

01:12:11.632 --> 01:12:12.465
Do what you do.

01:12:12.466 --> 01:12:13.733
I don't need to know about it.

01:12:13.734 --> 01:12:14.734
How does that sound?

01:12:17.137 --> 01:12:18.572
That sounds great, babe.

01:12:21.576 --> 01:12:22.576
Hey, babe?

01:12:22.576 --> 01:12:23.510
Mm‐hmm?

01:12:23.511 --> 01:12:25.077
You fuck a stripper, I kill you.

01:12:25.078 --> 01:12:26.078
Okay?

01:12:26.847 --> 01:12:28.549
Okay.

01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:35.988
Man, it's so good that
those girls are gone.

01:12:35.989 --> 01:12:37.709
It's been a long time
since we've done this.

01:12:37.710 --> 01:12:39.144
- We needed it.
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:12:39.145 --> 01:12:40.926
Hey, look at me!

01:12:40.927 --> 01:12:44.063
Looks like I'm going to be the
robe guy of this party, huh?

01:12:44.064 --> 01:12:45.230
Any objections?

01:12:45.231 --> 01:12:46.866
Uh, maybe a couple.

01:12:46.867 --> 01:12:48.033
Any luck?

01:12:48.034 --> 01:12:49.669
Oh, I don't need
luck, my friend.

01:12:49.670 --> 01:12:52.204
I got a little thing
called technology.

01:12:52.205 --> 01:12:55.875
I just found this app,
ordered two strippers.

01:12:55.876 --> 01:12:56.843
You got strippers coming?

01:12:56.844 --> 01:12:58.477
Oh, yeah.

01:12:58.478 --> 01:13:00.646
They're, uh‐‐.

01:13:00.647 --> 01:13:02.007
Wow, that dude is
the saddest thing

01:13:02.008 --> 01:13:03.048
I've ever seen in my life.

01:13:03.072 --> 01:13:05.384
Let me put on some
stripper music, yo!

01:13:05.385 --> 01:13:07.319
Yeah!

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:08.420
Bam.

01:13:08.421 --> 01:13:09.421
Yeah.

01:13:09.991 --> 01:13:10.991
Oh, okay.

01:13:10.991 --> 01:13:11.958
The strippers are here.

01:13:11.958 --> 01:13:12.859
Everybody sit down.

01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:14.226
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

01:13:14.227 --> 01:13:15.595
Come on, come on.
Get on the couch!

01:13:15.596 --> 01:13:16.496
Get on the couch!

01:13:16.497 --> 01:13:17.497
And keep it together.

01:13:17.497 --> 01:13:18.264
Keep it cool.

01:13:18.264 --> 01:13:19.165
Do not embarrass me.

01:13:19.165 --> 01:13:19.966
Chill.

01:13:19.966 --> 01:13:20.834
Chill out.

01:13:20.835 --> 01:13:22.067
Sorry I yelled. Let's have fun.

01:13:22.068 --> 01:13:23.135
All right.

01:13:23.136 --> 01:13:26.138
Just one second!

01:13:26.139 --> 01:13:28.007
Hi, I love your beard.

01:13:28.008 --> 01:13:28.809
Oh, heh‐heh.

01:13:28.810 --> 01:13:29.810
Hey.

01:13:36.282 --> 01:13:37.282
That's the guy!

01:13:37.283 --> 01:13:38.784
That's the bachelor!

01:13:38.785 --> 01:13:40.485
All right, that's me.

01:13:40.486 --> 01:13:41.287
Anyway‐‐.

01:13:41.288 --> 01:13:44.256
All right.

01:13:44.257 --> 01:13:45.257
Yeah, okay.

01:13:45.258 --> 01:13:46.458
Yeah!

01:13:46.459 --> 01:13:47.459
Wow.

01:13:50.196 --> 01:13:51.597
Heh‐heh.

01:13:51.598 --> 01:13:52.398
What?

01:13:52.398 --> 01:13:53.333
Um‐‐.

01:13:53.334 --> 01:13:54.734
- Whoa.
- Okay.

01:13:54.735 --> 01:13:55.536
Hold on.

01:13:55.537 --> 01:13:57.202
Is‐‐ is everything okay?

01:13:57.203 --> 01:13:58.337
Hey, she's crying.

01:13:58.338 --> 01:13:59.539
Oh, yeah, yeah yeah, sorry.

01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:01.380
He just gets really nervous
before a gang bang.

01:14:03.109 --> 01:14:04.844
That's not what this is.

01:14:04.845 --> 01:14:07.813
We can try it.

01:14:07.814 --> 01:14:08.615
Or not.

01:14:08.615 --> 01:14:09.482
Whatever.

01:14:09.483 --> 01:14:10.950
What you guys want.

01:14:10.951 --> 01:14:13.553
Gang bang, no gang bang,
I'm here to support.

01:14:13.554 --> 01:14:14.754
You girls on Linkedln?

01:14:14.755 --> 01:14:15.821
Excuse me, stripper?

01:14:15.822 --> 01:14:19.258
We're not at all
interested in a gang bang.

01:14:19.259 --> 01:14:22.427
We're just looking for some
innocent bachelor party fun

01:14:22.428 --> 01:14:23.696
here, okay?

01:14:23.697 --> 01:14:27.132
Maybe a little girl on
girl if things get crazy.

01:14:27.133 --> 01:14:29.034
We're not lesbian, you perverts.

01:14:29.035 --> 01:14:30.435
How are we the perverts here?

01:14:30.436 --> 01:14:31.904
Everyone, shut up.

01:14:31.905 --> 01:14:32.972
You, bachelor.

01:14:32.973 --> 01:14:35.340
It's $100 for handjobs,
250 for blowjobs,

01:14:35.341 --> 01:14:37.242
and 500 to put it
anywhere you want.

01:14:37.243 --> 01:14:39.344
Well, almost anywhere.

01:14:39.345 --> 01:14:41.213
The back door's always open,
but the front door's closed

01:14:41.214 --> 01:14:42.294
due to monthly maintenance.

01:14:42.318 --> 01:14:43.415
‐Oh, no! ‐No!

01:14:43.416 --> 01:14:45.184
Unless you're into it,
then it's double.

01:14:45.185 --> 01:14:46.152
Double?

01:14:46.153 --> 01:14:47.313
I don't think you understand.

01:14:47.337 --> 01:14:48.654
We're not really hooker guys.

01:14:48.655 --> 01:14:50.656
Okay, well, we're
really hookers.

01:14:50.657 --> 01:14:51.924
All right, sweetie, look.

01:14:51.925 --> 01:14:56.128
On this app, on this app,
it says in the description

01:14:56.129 --> 01:14:57.196
"exotic dancers."

01:14:57.197 --> 01:14:58.430
Okay.

01:14:58.431 --> 01:15:01.300
Well, that's because‐‐
that's because we can't say

01:15:01.301 --> 01:15:03.736
that we fuck for money, retard.

01:15:03.737 --> 01:15:06.371
You are a very
immature prostitute.

01:15:06.372 --> 01:15:08.173
Oh, really, senator?

01:15:08.174 --> 01:15:09.675
You're really immature yourself.

01:15:09.676 --> 01:15:10.843
You know what?

01:15:10.844 --> 01:15:12.564
We came all the way down
here, and we're not

01:15:12.588 --> 01:15:14.580
leaving until we get paid, okay?

01:15:14.581 --> 01:15:15.861
So who's ready to fucking party?

01:15:15.885 --> 01:15:16.949
‐No, not like that. ‐Huh?

01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:17.751
The brown guy?

01:15:17.752 --> 01:15:19.484
You want to party?

01:15:19.485 --> 01:15:22.321
Uh, how much is it for her to
stop crying and for both of you

01:15:22.322 --> 01:15:23.322
to go home?

01:15:24.526 --> 01:15:25.526
$300.

01:15:25.527 --> 01:15:27.893
Oh, that's a ripoff, man.

01:15:27.894 --> 01:15:29.061
How much for a handjob?

01:15:29.062 --> 01:15:29.863
Yes!

01:15:29.864 --> 01:15:31.532
Pussypop is back!

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:35.868
See this?

01:15:35.869 --> 01:15:37.302
Soak it in.

01:15:37.303 --> 01:15:38.771
That's your future.

01:15:38.772 --> 01:15:40.906
Nobody likes strippers
more than married dudes.

01:15:40.907 --> 01:15:42.508
Hell, is this one crying?

01:15:42.509 --> 01:15:43.609
Well, shit.

01:15:43.610 --> 01:15:45.845
I got some I'm into
cry and not cry, cry,

01:15:45.846 --> 01:15:48.480
cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry.

01:15:48.481 --> 01:15:49.282
Cry!

01:15:49.283 --> 01:15:51.250
Ha ha!

01:15:51.251 --> 01:15:53.719
Yeah!

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:54.920
Why aren't you crying?

01:15:54.921 --> 01:15:56.756
Hey, guys.

01:15:56.757 --> 01:15:57.997
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:16:00.995 --> 01:16:01.995
Hey, yeah.

01:16:01.995 --> 01:16:02.963
You know what?

01:16:02.964 --> 01:16:04.404
Hey, forget that
jack and jill party.

01:16:04.428 --> 01:16:05.798
That was way better
than that, man.

01:16:05.799 --> 01:16:06.799
Where's David?

01:16:07.701 --> 01:16:09.635
I think he's puking with
Pussypop somewhere.

01:16:09.636 --> 01:16:11.671
Where‐‐ where we going
to take him next?

01:16:11.672 --> 01:16:12.872
Let's go to Jumbo's, man.

01:16:12.873 --> 01:16:13.674
Ooh!

01:16:13.675 --> 01:16:14.707
Get him a lap dance.

01:16:14.708 --> 01:16:15.975
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:16:15.976 --> 01:16:18.811
Oh, Deb says that her and
the girls are at Poubelle.

01:16:18.812 --> 01:16:19.979
Oh, let's just do that then.

01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:21.380
Whoa, no way. Fuck that.

01:16:21.381 --> 01:16:22.715
This is our night, dude.

01:16:22.716 --> 01:16:25.217
Oh, but dude, you know, I'd
really like you to meet Deb,

01:16:25.218 --> 01:16:26.019
get to know her.

01:16:26.020 --> 01:16:28.487
Ha‐ha, who cares about Deb?

01:16:28.488 --> 01:16:30.089
‐Well, I care about Deb.
‐No, I know.

01:16:30.090 --> 01:16:31.591
I'm not‐‐ I don't
mean it like that.

01:16:31.592 --> 01:16:33.125
I'm just saying, you know, okay.

01:16:33.126 --> 01:16:34.060
Hey, look.

01:16:34.061 --> 01:16:35.360
I'm going to stop right here.

01:16:35.361 --> 01:16:36.428
Stop it. ‐What?

01:16:36.429 --> 01:16:37.163
‐Stop. ‐Stopping?

01:16:37.163 --> 01:16:37.998
Stop.

01:16:37.998 --> 01:16:38.832
Okay

01:16:38.833 --> 01:16:42.802
I was going to wait to do this.

01:16:42.803 --> 01:16:44.437
But fuck it, okay?

01:16:46.741 --> 01:16:47.741
What is that?

01:16:47.742 --> 01:16:49.141
What‐‐ what are those?

01:16:49.142 --> 01:16:52.678
These are the keys to
David's place, the place

01:16:52.679 --> 01:16:54.213
that David was talking about.

01:16:54.214 --> 01:16:56.048
I went down, and
I convinced them

01:16:56.049 --> 01:16:57.717
to let me make a deposit on it.

01:16:57.718 --> 01:17:00.019
This place is ours.

01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:02.454
Oh, dude.

01:17:02.455 --> 01:17:03.656
You really did that?

01:17:03.657 --> 01:17:05.925
I mean, that's‐‐
that's really cool.

01:17:05.926 --> 01:17:11.697
But I've been actually saving
up money to get my own place,

01:17:11.698 --> 01:17:13.099
like a condo or something.

01:17:15.368 --> 01:17:16.368
Howard, man.

01:17:16.369 --> 01:17:18.037
Are you being
responsible, Howard?

01:17:18.038 --> 01:17:19.438
That is his name.

01:17:19.439 --> 01:17:22.007
If you're responsible, you have
to use your full name, Howard.

01:17:22.008 --> 01:17:23.008
I don't know either.

01:17:23.009 --> 01:17:25.444
I'm‐‐ I kinda like
staying on campus.

01:17:25.445 --> 01:17:27.580
I'm thinking about
getting my master's,

01:17:27.581 --> 01:17:28.814
maybe becoming a professor.

01:17:28.815 --> 01:17:29.650
That's awesome.

01:17:29.651 --> 01:17:31.116
You're gonna make a difference.

01:17:31.117 --> 01:17:32.952
Yeah, maybe.

01:17:32.953 --> 01:17:34.353
And I also get to
hang around college

01:17:34.354 --> 01:17:35.554
girls for the rest of my life.

01:17:35.555 --> 01:17:37.195
So it's kinda like a
no‐brainer, you know?

01:17:37.219 --> 01:17:39.058
What's your excuse, huh, Mook?

01:17:39.059 --> 01:17:41.193
I don't think the time is right.

01:17:41.194 --> 01:17:43.295
You don't think it's
the right time.

01:17:43.296 --> 01:17:44.296
Ha.

01:17:47.467 --> 01:17:48.547
Are you guys being serious?

01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:56.242
You guys‐‐ you don't want
to live together anymore?

01:18:00.514 --> 01:18:01.914
It's over?

01:18:01.915 --> 01:18:05.618
No, we're almost contractually
allowed to hang out again soon.

01:18:05.619 --> 01:18:08.588
Yeah, but it was supposed
to go back to the way

01:18:08.589 --> 01:18:11.223
that things were.

01:18:11.224 --> 01:18:13.092
To be honest, man, I
really want to go

01:18:13.093 --> 01:18:14.359
back to the way things were.

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:17.162
I like how things are now.

01:18:17.163 --> 01:18:18.497
Yeah.

01:18:18.498 --> 01:18:19.498
Same.

01:18:24.170 --> 01:18:25.170
Oh.

01:18:25.171 --> 01:18:26.606
I feel like a big
asshole right now.

01:18:26.607 --> 01:18:27.907
‐No, Adam, come on. ‐No, no.

01:18:27.908 --> 01:18:28.941
Hey, come on. Look.

01:18:28.942 --> 01:18:30.375
That's not the way it is, man.

01:18:30.376 --> 01:18:33.946
I mean, the breakup actually
worked for all of us.

01:18:33.947 --> 01:18:35.981
Yeah, for you, man.

01:18:35.982 --> 01:18:37.850
For you.

01:18:37.851 --> 01:18:38.685
I didn't work for me.

01:18:38.685 --> 01:18:39.485
I lost.

01:18:39.486 --> 01:18:41.220
I fucked it all up.

01:18:41.221 --> 01:18:45.190
And I tried to do this shit,
and I just fucked it all up.

01:18:45.191 --> 01:18:46.631
Isn't not going to
be the way it was.

01:18:46.655 --> 01:18:48.327
We can't just go back.

01:18:48.328 --> 01:18:50.195
Why bother?

01:18:50.196 --> 01:18:51.564
Hey, hey.

01:18:51.565 --> 01:18:52.432
Where are you going?

01:18:52.432 --> 01:18:53.266
I don't know.

01:18:53.267 --> 01:18:54.534
I don't know where I'm going.

01:18:54.535 --> 01:18:57.302
But I'm telling you, I fucked
it up, and I don't know.

01:18:57.303 --> 01:18:58.804
Okay?

01:18:58.805 --> 01:19:00.439
So you‐‐ you guys, good.

01:19:00.440 --> 01:19:01.641
You're better off without me.

01:19:01.642 --> 01:19:04.043
And I'm going to go be
better off without you.

01:19:04.044 --> 01:19:07.046
That's not cool, bro.

01:19:07.047 --> 01:19:08.248
It's not how it is.

01:21:11.171 --> 01:21:12.371
Shit.

01:21:12.372 --> 01:21:13.706
Shit.

01:21:13.707 --> 01:21:16.241
I can't‐‐ I can't find that
bag‐‐ that‐‐ that little bag

01:21:16.242 --> 01:21:18.110
had the‐‐ the cufflinks in it.

01:21:18.111 --> 01:21:19.444
I hate that bag, you
know what I mean?

01:21:19.445 --> 01:21:20.780
It's the worst bag in the world.

01:21:20.781 --> 01:21:21.715
It's like, I had it.

01:21:21.716 --> 01:21:24.083
I had the bag at the rehearsal.

01:21:24.084 --> 01:21:25.524
I definitely had it
at the rehearsal.

01:21:25.548 --> 01:21:27.319
I mean, is it so hard
to make a fucking shirt

01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:28.688
with black buttons
already on it.

01:21:28.689 --> 01:21:29.556
Relax. I'll go get the bag.

01:21:29.557 --> 01:21:30.690
It's cool.

01:21:30.691 --> 01:21:32.024
Seriously, it's a man's
wedding day, you know?

01:21:32.025 --> 01:21:34.225
You would think that the last
thing would be on his mind

01:21:34.226 --> 01:21:35.426
are the fucking black buttons.

01:21:35.450 --> 01:21:37.697
David, sit down.

01:21:37.698 --> 01:21:38.998
It's like, I can't
wear white buttons.

01:21:38.999 --> 01:21:40.465
Amanda will kill
me‐‐ ‐Right, I know.

01:21:40.466 --> 01:21:41.734
‐‐you know, let alone marry me.

01:21:41.735 --> 01:21:42.735
She might just kill me in
front of her whole family.

01:21:42.736 --> 01:21:43.803
I hear you, okay?

01:21:43.804 --> 01:21:45.938
Yeah, we're doing it.

01:21:45.939 --> 01:21:47.039
Jack Daniel's.

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:47.841
Hey.

01:21:47.842 --> 01:21:49.275
Hey, what up, man?

01:21:50.711 --> 01:21:53.078
Um, are you‐‐ you're sure
you need that bag now?

01:21:53.079 --> 01:21:54.639
Because you look‐‐ I
mean, you just look

01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:55.840
great just looking at you now.

01:21:55.864 --> 01:21:57.249
Yeah.

01:21:57.250 --> 01:21:58.184
Yes, I need the b‐‐ why?

01:21:58.185 --> 01:22:00.052
What's going on?

01:22:00.053 --> 01:22:02.922
Um, the guys are out there.

01:22:02.923 --> 01:22:04.590
And it's just weird.

01:22:04.591 --> 01:22:07.159
I‐‐ I haven't talked to them,
you know, since the thing or‐‐

01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:09.328
Adam, it's my wedding day.

01:22:09.329 --> 01:22:10.495
Swallow your pride.

01:22:10.496 --> 01:22:12.331
Make nice‐nice with
your fucking friends.

01:22:12.332 --> 01:22:15.367
And get me that fucking bag!

01:22:15.368 --> 01:22:16.869
Just give me the fucking bag!

01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:17.671
You nervous?

01:22:17.671 --> 01:22:18.605
I just want to die.

01:22:18.606 --> 01:22:21.406
Here.

01:22:21.407 --> 01:22:23.208
Here, here.

01:22:23.209 --> 01:22:24.010
Just‐‐ just drink.

01:22:24.011 --> 01:22:27.280
I'm gonna die a virgin.

01:22:38.258 --> 01:22:39.725
It's really happening, huh?

01:22:39.726 --> 01:22:42.327
Yeah, it really is.

01:22:42.328 --> 01:22:45.064
No, I‐‐ I don't know if this is
the best time to bring this up.

01:22:45.065 --> 01:22:49.068
Uh, I've been meaning
to apologize to you.

01:22:49.069 --> 01:22:54.707
Uh, you know, I‐‐ I probably
wasn't the best boyfriend.

01:22:54.708 --> 01:22:56.341
Adam, it's fine.

01:22:56.342 --> 01:22:57.543
Honestly.

01:22:57.544 --> 01:22:59.712
Everything worked out the
way it was supposed to.

01:22:59.713 --> 01:23:00.713
We're good.

01:23:08.322 --> 01:23:09.322
‐ Prick. ‐Hey.

01:23:09.322 --> 01:23:10.156
I know.

01:23:10.157 --> 01:23:11.625
I'm just‐‐ I'm sorry kind of.

01:23:22.368 --> 01:23:23.435
Whoa, hey. What's up?

01:23:23.436 --> 01:23:24.237
Hey.

01:23:24.237 --> 01:23:25.038
What's up, man?

01:23:25.038 --> 01:23:25.939
How are you, man?

01:23:25.939 --> 01:23:26.873
‐lt's been so long. ‐Oh, man.

01:23:26.873 --> 01:23:27.674
I haven't seen you.

01:23:27.675 --> 01:23:28.675
Yeah, hey.

01:23:28.676 --> 01:23:30.036
Yeah, I heard‐‐ I
read on your blog

01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:31.544
that you're writing
for Yahoo now?

01:23:31.545 --> 01:23:32.812
Yeah, Yahoo.

01:23:32.813 --> 01:23:34.514
Yeah, well, I mean, you know,
I'm a freelance writer.

01:23:34.515 --> 01:23:36.381
But, uh, there's a shot that
might bump me up to staff.

01:23:36.382 --> 01:23:37.183
So good to hear.

01:23:37.184 --> 01:23:38.483
How are you doing?

01:23:38.484 --> 01:23:40.185
Uh, good, man.

01:23:40.186 --> 01:23:41.386
Good.

01:23:41.387 --> 01:23:45.357
It's been slightly, like,
weird without you guys.

01:23:45.358 --> 01:23:46.391
Wrote a lot of books.

01:23:46.392 --> 01:23:47.392
Uh‐huh.

01:23:47.393 --> 01:23:48.961
Went on a lot of pub
crawls on my own.

01:23:48.962 --> 01:23:50.029
No way.

01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:52.297
Got really into Chris
Isaak for a while.

01:23:52.298 --> 01:23:54.266
One day, I was just like,
oh, let's just see how

01:23:54.267 --> 01:23:55.387
many times I can masturbate.

01:23:55.411 --> 01:23:56.169
No way.

01:23:56.170 --> 01:23:57.803
Can you check and see the guys?

01:23:57.804 --> 01:23:59.805
11.

01:23:59.806 --> 01:24:02.241
Never look at Jennifer
Lawrence again.

01:24:02.242 --> 01:24:03.176
Can you‐‐.

01:24:03.177 --> 01:24:04.710
Tried crystal meth.

01:24:04.711 --> 01:24:06.846
Um, it was pretty good.

01:24:06.847 --> 01:24:09.749
Can you see the guys
over‐‐ over this way?

01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:10.551
Mm‐hmm.

01:24:10.551 --> 01:24:11.351
Yeah.

01:24:11.352 --> 01:24:12.432
Are they looking over here?

01:24:12.456 --> 01:24:13.219
‐Yep. ‐They are?

01:24:13.220 --> 01:24:14.419
Yep.

01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:15.755
Can you just do something,
like I just made a joke?

01:24:15.756 --> 01:24:16.822
Like laugh.

01:24:16.823 --> 01:24:18.457
Just, like, laugh
like crazy right now.

01:24:18.458 --> 01:24:20.098
What, are you trying
to make them jealous?

01:24:20.122 --> 01:24:20.794
No.

01:24:20.795 --> 01:24:21.915
Will you just fucking laugh?

01:24:21.939 --> 01:24:23.462
Please do this for me.

01:24:23.463 --> 01:24:24.463
Go.

01:24:26.199 --> 01:24:27.299
Right?

01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:28.333
Right? Right?

01:24:28.334 --> 01:24:29.974
No, don't look over there.
Look over here.

01:24:29.975 --> 01:24:30.809
Make it about me. Yeah.

01:24:30.810 --> 01:24:32.304
Oh, right?

01:24:32.305 --> 01:24:33.739
Cool man. So, um‐‐

01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:34.974
‐ ‐Okay, hold on.

01:24:34.975 --> 01:24:36.642
Can you just look over here now?
Don't look at them.

01:24:36.643 --> 01:24:37.477
Don't look at them, dude.

01:24:37.477 --> 01:24:38.477
Don't look at them.

01:24:39.346 --> 01:24:40.626
Do I‐‐ I seem
comfortable, right?

01:24:40.650 --> 01:24:41.413
Yes.

01:24:41.414 --> 01:24:42.115
Well, don't‐‐ you got
to stop laughing.

01:24:42.115 --> 01:24:42.849
Stop laughing. ‐Okay.

01:24:42.850 --> 01:24:44.049
Stop fucking laughing.

01:24:44.050 --> 01:24:44.885
Well, hold on one second.

01:24:44.886 --> 01:24:46.251
Don't leave.

01:24:46.252 --> 01:24:48.533
Let me be the one who leaves
so it looks more like I‐‐ I'm

01:24:48.557 --> 01:24:51.023
the guy who's, like,
deciding when

01:24:51.024 --> 01:24:52.392
the conversation's over, okay?

01:24:55.662 --> 01:24:56.662
‐Ro. ‐Ro.

01:24:56.663 --> 01:24:57.930
‐Ro. ‐My man.

01:24:57.931 --> 01:24:58.799
Hey, hey, hey.

01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:00.000
Come over here. ‐Get over here.

01:25:00.001 --> 01:25:00.802
Hey, how's it going?

01:25:00.803 --> 01:25:02.234
I missed you guys.

01:25:02.235 --> 01:25:03.169
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:25:03.170 --> 01:25:04.236
No, no, no, no. What did he say?

01:25:04.237 --> 01:25:05.071
What did Adam say to you?

01:25:05.072 --> 01:25:06.072
We saw you guys talking.

01:25:06.073 --> 01:25:07.172
What's up?

01:25:07.173 --> 01:25:10.676
Okay, I cannot deal
with this anymore!

01:25:10.677 --> 01:25:14.413
I cannot be in the
middle anymore!

01:25:14.414 --> 01:25:16.516
You guys are playing
a wicked game!

01:25:16.517 --> 01:25:17.450
Whoa.

01:25:17.451 --> 01:25:19.284
I got to find some crystal meth.

01:25:19.285 --> 01:25:20.286
Shit!

01:26:08.434 --> 01:26:10.202
Adam.

01:26:10.203 --> 01:26:12.538
Hey.

01:26:12.539 --> 01:26:13.339
I'm sorry.

01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:15.274
Um‐‐.

01:26:15.275 --> 01:26:16.609
Call me Uncle Reed.

01:26:16.610 --> 01:26:17.810
I'm a friend of your mother's.

01:26:17.834 --> 01:26:18.778
Oh.

01:26:18.779 --> 01:26:20.145
That's a hell of a wedding
going on, isn't it?

01:26:20.146 --> 01:26:21.114
Yeah, it's, uh, good.

01:26:21.115 --> 01:26:22.848
I haven't seen you dancing.

01:26:22.849 --> 01:26:23.817
Yeah, I don't know.

01:26:23.818 --> 01:26:26.753
I'm just not‐‐ not‐‐
dancing tonight.

01:26:28.254 --> 01:26:29.354
Oh, yeah.

01:26:29.355 --> 01:26:32.457
I used to be like
that‐‐ self‐conscious

01:26:32.458 --> 01:26:34.426
about being another
run‐of‐the‐mill

01:26:34.427 --> 01:26:36.196
white guy dancing at a wedding.

01:26:38.331 --> 01:26:39.565
Yeah.

01:26:39.566 --> 01:26:41.526
I mean, that's just‐‐ that's
not really the issue.

01:26:41.550 --> 01:26:44.069
I just kinda‐‐ not really
in the mood, you know?

01:26:44.070 --> 01:26:44.971
I get it.

01:26:44.972 --> 01:26:46.305
I get it‐‐ weddings.

01:26:46.306 --> 01:26:48.546
Weddings‐‐ yeah, you never
know how they're gonna hit ya.

01:26:48.570 --> 01:26:53.445
But Davy's‐‐ he's a good kid.

01:26:53.446 --> 01:26:56.616
I don't think you have to
worry about losing him.

01:26:56.617 --> 01:26:58.518
Um, yeah.

01:26:58.519 --> 01:27:00.920
I'm actually not worried
about that at all.

01:27:00.921 --> 01:27:02.354
Families get bigger.

01:27:02.355 --> 01:27:03.355
Right.

01:27:03.356 --> 01:27:05.791
And Davy‐‐ he's‐‐
he's the same guy.

01:27:05.792 --> 01:27:07.459
Well, he‐‐ nobody
really calls him Davy.

01:27:07.460 --> 01:27:08.428
Um, and‐‐

01:27:08.428 --> 01:27:09.229
Adam.

01:27:09.230 --> 01:27:11.564
What's up?

01:27:11.565 --> 01:27:17.036
The book of life has
many, many chapters.

01:27:17.037 --> 01:27:18.070
Right?

01:27:18.071 --> 01:27:20.372
And what once you
finish one chapter,

01:27:20.373 --> 01:27:22.007
you don't throw away the book.

01:27:22.008 --> 01:27:22.909
Mm.

01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:24.243
You keep on reading.

01:27:24.244 --> 01:27:26.444
Is this‐‐ are you a‐‐ is this
a psychologist thing or‐‐.

01:27:28.014 --> 01:27:29.449
Oh, my god.

01:27:32.018 --> 01:27:33.118
Scientology, no.

01:27:33.119 --> 01:27:35.589
Are you‐‐ I'm sorry,
but who are you again?

01:27:39.092 --> 01:27:40.593
I'm a friend of your mom's.

01:27:40.594 --> 01:27:41.594
Okay.

01:27:44.297 --> 01:27:46.966
And if you really
want to dig down

01:27:46.967 --> 01:27:50.102
a little deeper into the
reality of the situation‐‐

01:27:50.103 --> 01:27:51.303
I don't know. I don't know.

01:27:51.304 --> 01:27:52.272
‐‐then‐‐.

01:27:52.272 --> 01:27:53.173
Hey, Adam.

01:27:53.174 --> 01:27:54.507
They're about to cut the cake.

01:27:54.508 --> 01:27:55.775
Okay, cool.

01:27:55.776 --> 01:27:58.711
I should probably get in there
for my brother and all.

01:27:58.712 --> 01:28:01.647
And this‐‐ this is super‐‐
super fucking weird.

01:28:01.648 --> 01:28:02.682
But, um, thank you.

01:28:02.683 --> 01:28:03.817
Thanks, uh, for the talk.

01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:08.287
Super fucking weird?

01:28:08.288 --> 01:28:10.528
What's super fucking weird is
I'm super fucking your mom.

01:28:10.529 --> 01:28:11.849
That's what's super
fucking weird.

01:28:11.873 --> 01:28:12.825
So listen.

01:28:12.826 --> 01:28:15.107
I know that it's my job to
share, uh, embarrassing stories

01:28:15.131 --> 01:28:15.628
here.

01:28:15.629 --> 01:28:17.749
But, uh, David made we promise
that I wouldn't come up

01:28:17.773 --> 01:28:21.366
here and talk about how he tried
to reinvent himself in college

01:28:21.367 --> 01:28:23.803
as Rave Dave, the one‐man party,
and get really good at glow

01:28:23.804 --> 01:28:24.870
sticks.

01:28:24.871 --> 01:28:26.405
Anyway, that's well behind them.

01:28:26.406 --> 01:28:28.206
But if we get lucky, maybe
he'll pull him out.

01:28:28.230 --> 01:28:29.230
It's not happening.

01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:35.148
To David and Amanda, everybody.

01:28:58.104 --> 01:28:59.138
Hey.

01:28:59.139 --> 01:28:59.940
Hey.

01:28:59.941 --> 01:29:01.340
Are you having a good time?

01:29:01.341 --> 01:29:02.142
Yeah, of course, I am.

01:29:02.142 --> 01:29:02.943
Yeah.

01:29:02.944 --> 01:29:04.043
It's just great.

01:29:04.044 --> 01:29:05.724
This is the best‐‐ I
mean, this is the best

01:29:05.725 --> 01:29:06.592
wedding I've ever been to.

01:29:06.593 --> 01:29:07.880
Oh, thanks.

01:29:07.881 --> 01:29:09.782
That's sweet.

01:29:09.783 --> 01:29:12.051
So why do you look so miserable?

01:29:12.052 --> 01:29:13.719
Heh.

01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:15.955
Just go say hi.

01:29:15.956 --> 01:29:18.758
Uh, I‐‐ I can't.

01:29:18.759 --> 01:29:21.727
Adam, I've known you
for a long time.

01:29:21.728 --> 01:29:25.130
I know you can.

01:29:25.131 --> 01:29:26.365
You can't say no to me.

01:29:26.366 --> 01:29:27.366
This is my wedding day.

01:29:32.639 --> 01:29:33.639
All right.

01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:34.640
Okay.

01:29:41.549 --> 01:29:42.549
Thank you.

01:29:42.549 --> 01:29:43.549
You're welcome.

01:30:06.406 --> 01:30:08.774
You guys, uh, I'm sorry.

01:30:08.775 --> 01:30:10.175
Ha ha ha!

01:30:10.176 --> 01:30:11.443
Yeah!

01:30:11.444 --> 01:30:13.312
All right, I knew you
were going to do that.

01:30:13.313 --> 01:30:15.681
Dude, there is no
reason to apologize.

01:30:15.682 --> 01:30:16.482
No, look.

01:30:16.483 --> 01:30:18.450
I‐‐ I‐‐ there is, okay?

01:30:18.451 --> 01:30:19.652
I thought that this
was just gonna

01:30:19.653 --> 01:30:21.120
be another one of those
stupid things that we do,

01:30:21.121 --> 01:30:22.921
like when we got stoned
every day for a month.

01:30:22.945 --> 01:30:24.156
Jewel High, 2010.

01:30:24.157 --> 01:30:24.958
Right.

01:30:24.958 --> 01:30:25.958
That fucking sucked!

01:30:27.628 --> 01:30:30.429
I thought that afterwards
that it was all just

01:30:30.430 --> 01:30:31.797
gonna go back to the
way things were,

01:30:31.798 --> 01:30:32.958
and that's why I freaked out.

01:30:32.959 --> 01:30:34.826
I‐‐ I didn't think that
it would actually work.

01:30:34.827 --> 01:30:37.603
Adam, the whole breakup
worked, because we‐‐

01:30:37.604 --> 01:30:40.606
we gave each other
enough space to figure

01:30:40.607 --> 01:30:41.707
out what we really wanted.

01:30:41.708 --> 01:30:44.610
Yes, and now we are
even more awesome.

01:30:44.611 --> 01:30:46.747
So what else would you want?

01:30:49.783 --> 01:30:52.351
Honestly?

01:30:52.352 --> 01:30:53.719
Beth.

01:30:53.720 --> 01:30:55.960
I know that she doesn't want
to be at the top of my list.

01:30:55.984 --> 01:30:58.724
But she's what's missing.

01:30:58.725 --> 01:31:01.126
Hey, there's these guys.

01:31:01.127 --> 01:31:02.663
Bros before hos, huh?

01:31:05.399 --> 01:31:06.399
That was weird.

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:09.234
All right, just
trying to fit in.

01:31:09.235 --> 01:31:10.402
Okay, have fun.

01:31:10.403 --> 01:31:12.037
Hey, dude.

01:31:12.038 --> 01:31:14.339
That list has got to be a
lot shorter now, right?

01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:16.041
Yeah, and if that's
what's missing,

01:31:16.042 --> 01:31:18.077
let's go fix that shit, brother.

01:31:18.078 --> 01:31:19.344
Yeah, let's get the girl!

01:31:19.345 --> 01:31:20.146
Get the girl.

01:31:20.147 --> 01:31:21.380
Babe, come on.

01:31:21.381 --> 01:31:22.549
We got to get the girl.

01:31:26.020 --> 01:31:27.020
Oh!

01:31:27.021 --> 01:31:28.387
We took the shuttle
from the hotel.

01:31:28.388 --> 01:31:29.555
Let's do it.

01:31:29.556 --> 01:31:30.556
Yes!

01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:35.560
‐The keys are in the ignition.
‐Yes.

01:31:35.584 --> 01:31:36.428
Who's driving?

01:31:36.429 --> 01:31:37.663
I can't drive a bus.

01:31:37.664 --> 01:31:39.664
I would fail every DUI test
known to man right now.

01:31:39.688 --> 01:31:41.433
I'm legally forbidden
from driving buses.

01:31:41.434 --> 01:31:42.735
You guys know that.

01:31:42.736 --> 01:31:46.205
I can drive a bus.

01:31:46.206 --> 01:31:47.908
How cool is this guy?

01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:49.709
One second.

01:31:53.047 --> 01:31:54.047
Hello?

01:31:54.048 --> 01:31:55.247
Hey, listen.

01:31:55.248 --> 01:31:57.248
Uh, I‐‐ I promise you that
this isn't a booty call.

01:31:57.272 --> 01:31:59.251
I just‐‐ where‐‐ where
are you right now?

01:31:59.252 --> 01:32:00.053
Okay.

01:32:00.053 --> 01:32:00.854
Uh, listen.

01:32:00.854 --> 01:32:01.755
Stay right there, okay?

01:32:01.755 --> 01:32:02.755
Okay.

01:32:05.539 --> 01:32:06.859
Now, do you know
what you're going

01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:07.900
to say when you get there?

01:32:07.901 --> 01:32:09.381
Do‐‐ do you need any
help or anything?

01:32:09.405 --> 01:32:11.330
Uh, yeah, you know,
I think I got it.

01:32:11.331 --> 01:32:12.132
Yeah.

01:32:12.132 --> 01:32:12.966
You sure?

01:32:12.966 --> 01:32:13.767
Yeah.

01:32:13.767 --> 01:32:14.701
Thanks.

01:32:14.702 --> 01:32:15.968
All right.

01:32:15.969 --> 01:32:19.772
Well, I did steal Kelly
Kapowski away from Zack Morris,

01:32:19.773 --> 01:32:20.940
you know?

01:32:20.941 --> 01:32:22.241
I'm just saying.

01:32:22.242 --> 01:32:23.109
Yeah.

01:32:23.110 --> 01:32:24.110
I got it. Thanks, though.

01:32:24.111 --> 01:32:25.177
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:32:25.178 --> 01:32:26.012
- Thanks.
- All right.

01:32:26.012 --> 01:32:27.012
Here. Pull off here.

01:32:36.957 --> 01:32:38.057
Listen.

01:32:38.058 --> 01:32:40.425
You got this, Preppy.

01:32:40.426 --> 01:32:44.630
Oh, my‐‐ it's so‐‐ so awesome
that you just called me that.

01:32:44.631 --> 01:32:45.631
Thanks, man.

01:32:50.871 --> 01:32:51.871
Yeah.

01:32:51.872 --> 01:32:53.639
I am pretty awesome.

01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:54.575
Beth.

01:32:54.575 --> 01:32:55.575
Beth.

01:32:58.812 --> 01:33:00.813
Look, I know there's a lot
to take in right now.

01:33:00.814 --> 01:33:02.648
But this has to
happen now, okay?

01:33:02.649 --> 01:33:03.449
Guys, come out here.

01:33:03.450 --> 01:33:04.518
Barrett, Mook, Howie.

01:33:09.591 --> 01:33:10.711
Beth, you already know Mook.

01:33:10.735 --> 01:33:11.824
And this is Howie.

01:33:11.825 --> 01:33:13.659
And that's Barrett over there.

01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:15.895
I need you to know these
guys, because, uh, I

01:33:15.896 --> 01:33:17.563
want you to know me.

01:33:17.564 --> 01:33:20.265
We broke up.

01:33:20.266 --> 01:33:22.702
During that time, I
had to decide what

01:33:22.703 --> 01:33:25.370
I wanted to do with my life.

01:33:25.371 --> 01:33:26.206
It was really hard.

01:33:26.207 --> 01:33:28.541
But I think I finally did it.

01:33:28.542 --> 01:33:30.042
I mean, I'm‐‐ I'm a writer now.

01:33:30.043 --> 01:33:31.310
Blogger, technically.

01:33:31.311 --> 01:33:32.112
All right, Barrett.

01:33:32.113 --> 01:33:34.213
Okay

01:33:34.214 --> 01:33:35.648
I got my own place.

01:33:35.649 --> 01:33:36.482
In Burbank.

01:33:36.482 --> 01:33:37.482
Mook, it doesn't‐‐.

01:33:41.221 --> 01:33:43.989
The only thing in my life that's
missing right now is you.

01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:46.226
Oh, that is so cute, huh?

01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:48.227
All right.

01:33:48.228 --> 01:33:49.828
I should have kept
these guys in the bus.

01:33:49.852 --> 01:33:51.496
Can I come up there?

01:33:51.497 --> 01:33:52.497
Yeah.

01:33:58.272 --> 01:33:59.272
Oh.

01:33:59.272 --> 01:34:00.073
Beth, thanks.

01:34:00.074 --> 01:34:01.241
That's, uh, much better.

01:34:03.977 --> 01:34:05.344
Look.

01:34:05.345 --> 01:34:10.015
Uh, Beth, I, um‐‐ I realize
now that you needed time too.

01:34:10.016 --> 01:34:12.752
And I didn't respect that.

01:34:12.753 --> 01:34:15.420
And I‐‐ I should've.

01:34:15.421 --> 01:34:20.192
So I'm sorry.

01:34:20.193 --> 01:34:23.262
Thank you.

01:34:23.263 --> 01:34:24.983
You know, I keep thinking
about that guy who

01:34:25.007 --> 01:34:27.700
was masturbating in the park.

01:34:27.701 --> 01:34:29.635
And why doesn't
that surprise me?

01:34:29.636 --> 01:34:31.116
The truth is, you
have a lot in common

01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:34.339
with that filthy exhibitionist.

01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:35.900
Look, you're going to
look back on this,

01:34:35.924 --> 01:34:39.444
and you're going to wonder
what could've happened.

01:34:39.445 --> 01:34:45.936
What you let go just because
the timing wasn't right.

01:34:47.487 --> 01:34:48.788
Beth, I miss you.

01:34:48.789 --> 01:34:50.990
And I just‐‐ I want to go
back to the way things were.

01:34:50.991 --> 01:34:52.725
I want‐‐ I want to
hang out with you.

01:34:52.726 --> 01:34:53.859
I want to be around you.

01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:58.531
And this way, if
you decide one day

01:34:58.532 --> 01:35:00.265
that you want more
than you know what,

01:35:00.266 --> 01:35:01.346
I'm going to be right here.

01:35:06.940 --> 01:35:08.241
I don't‐‐ I don't want that.

01:35:21.154 --> 01:35:23.322
I missed you too.

01:35:23.323 --> 01:35:25.324
Are you sure about this?

01:35:25.325 --> 01:35:26.325
No.

01:35:28.662 --> 01:35:30.996
But I'm ready.

01:35:30.997 --> 01:35:31.965
Hey, wait.

01:35:31.966 --> 01:35:33.398
That‐‐ that guy who
would, you know,

01:35:33.399 --> 01:35:36.368
dress up in the California
Raisins costume and, you know,

01:35:36.369 --> 01:35:41.006
win fishbowl races‐‐
I‐‐ I liked that guy.

01:35:41.007 --> 01:35:43.809
And I liked who I was
around that guy.

01:35:43.810 --> 01:35:47.046
He's not completely gone, is he?

01:35:47.047 --> 01:35:48.080
Uh, no.

01:35:48.081 --> 01:35:50.616
I mean, I just stole
a bus and crashed

01:35:50.617 --> 01:35:51.717
a party with my friends.

01:35:51.718 --> 01:35:53.318
So I would say it's
safe to say that this

01:35:53.342 --> 01:35:54.342
is never gonna be boring.

01:36:07.433 --> 01:36:08.873
I wonder what they're
doing up there.

01:36:13.439 --> 01:36:14.840
You guys are
definitely gonna win

01:36:14.841 --> 01:36:16.208
best couples costume tonight.

01:36:16.209 --> 01:36:17.010
Us?

01:36:17.010 --> 01:36:17.811
What are talking about?

01:36:17.811 --> 01:36:18.779
You know who's the shoo‐in?

01:36:18.779 --> 01:36:19.613
Mook and Stephanie.

01:36:19.613 --> 01:36:20.413
Look.

01:36:20.414 --> 01:36:21.714
What? Yeah!

01:36:21.715 --> 01:36:23.315
‐Hahaha, yeah! ‐All right.

01:36:23.316 --> 01:36:24.584
I don't mind being
the fifth wheel

01:36:24.585 --> 01:36:26.225
tonight, 'cause you
guys all look amazing.

01:36:26.249 --> 01:36:28.688
But I'm just saying, I'm very
happy to be single on Halloween

01:36:28.689 --> 01:36:29.489
night.

01:36:29.490 --> 01:36:31.323
I got the winning costume.

01:36:31.324 --> 01:36:32.424
It's not original, but‐‐.

01:36:32.425 --> 01:36:34.126
Are you going to Lyle's
Halloween party?

01:36:34.127 --> 01:36:34.961
Me too.

01:36:34.961 --> 01:36:35.762
Hey, what's up?

01:36:35.762 --> 01:36:36.730
I'm Barrett.

01:36:36.730 --> 01:36:37.664
Hey, Barrett.

01:36:37.665 --> 01:36:39.999
I like what you got
going on here.

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:40.901
Okay Okay.

01:36:40.902 --> 01:36:42.142
No, we're good. We're good here.

01:36:42.166 --> 01:36:43.669
We're‐‐ ‐Hey, Elvis.

01:36:43.670 --> 01:36:45.204
Howie's still gonna meet
us with us after he's

01:36:45.205 --> 01:36:46.039
done trick‐or‐treating?

01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:47.280
That's the plan, but who knows?

01:36:47.304 --> 01:36:48.304
Nice.

01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:50.911
Howie!

01:36:51.878 --> 01:36:53.078
Hey!

01:36:53.079 --> 01:36:55.347
We've figured out the best
way to trick‐or‐treat!

01:36:55.348 --> 01:36:58.884
Come on board!

01:36:58.885 --> 01:37:00.820
Oh, my god, what is this?

01:37:00.821 --> 01:37:03.022
Only the best invention
known to man.

01:37:03.023 --> 01:37:04.156
Get up on that thing, girl!

01:37:04.157 --> 01:37:05.157
Woo!

01:37:06.159 --> 01:37:07.760
So are you coming with us, or‐‐

01:37:07.761 --> 01:37:09.795
I'm not letting you out
of my sight again.

01:37:09.796 --> 01:37:11.130
Again?

01:37:11.131 --> 01:37:14.033
So I gather this is not your
first time on a barcycle.

01:37:14.034 --> 01:37:16.001
No, and it's definitely
gonna be my last.

01:37:16.002 --> 01:37:18.170
Better not be.

01:37:18.171 --> 01:37:19.238
All right.

01:37:19.239 --> 01:37:23.108
We got to get one little
kid candy pronto.

01:37:23.109 --> 01:37:23.944
So peddle!

01:37:23.945 --> 01:37:25.277
Ooh, I want some candy!

01:37:25.278 --> 01:37:26.278
I want candy!

01:37:26.279 --> 01:37:27.399
Well, keep‐‐ get your candy.

01:37:27.423 --> 01:37:28.814
Just keep your pants on, Mook.

01:37:28.815 --> 01:37:30.115
No promises!

01:37:30.116 --> 01:37:32.484
But actually keep your
pants on for real.

01:37:32.485 --> 01:37:33.485
There a kid around.
