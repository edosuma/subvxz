00:05.380 --> 00:07.090
<i>"Henry Danger."</i>

00:07.132 --> 00:09.927
<i>- Last night, the graffiti gang</i>

00:07.132 --> 00:09.927
<i>known as the Wall Dogs</i>

00:09.969 --> 00:12.011
<i>struck Swellview's</i>

00:09.969 --> 00:12.011
<i>public library.</i>

00:12.053 --> 00:12.888
Let's form a posse

00:12.930 --> 00:14.723
so we can catch those Wall Dogs

00:14.765 --> 00:16.558
and get the reward money.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.435
-No.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.435
-Nope.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.604
I want to get foot

00:18.560 --> 00:20.604
reduction surgery.

00:20.646 --> 00:22.147
- To stop the whole gang,

00:22.189 --> 00:24.358
we just have to capture

00:22.189 --> 00:24.358
the leader of the gang.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.318
<i>I am Van Del.</i>

00:26.360 --> 00:28.737
<i>Prepared to be sprayed.</i>

00:28.779 --> 00:30.364
Freeze, Wall Dogs!

00:30.656 --> 00:31.406
Hey, whoa, hey!

00:30.656 --> 00:31.406
Hey, wait!

00:31.448 --> 00:32.282
Hey, hey, hey!

00:32.324 --> 00:33.784
Now, you better just--

00:33.826 --> 00:36.537
Whoa. You're a girl dog.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.205
Come on, whoa, what the--

00:38.246 --> 00:39.456
Stop. Dang it.

00:39.498 --> 00:41.000
- Bye Herbert.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.209
(Man)

00:41.291 --> 00:42.209
You let a criminal escape.

00:42.250 --> 00:43.168
Did she say anything

00:43.210 --> 00:44.252
that could help us find them?

00:44.294 --> 00:45.796
- Meet me tomorrow night

00:45.838 --> 00:47.297
under the Swellview sign.

00:47.339 --> 00:49.174
- Hey, what are you--

00:47.339 --> 00:49.174
No, don't--

00:49.216 --> 00:50.509
No, she didn't say anything.

00:50.551 --> 00:51.760
What happened to you?

00:51.802 --> 00:53.345
The snake bit my hand.

00:54.137 --> 00:55.263
(Veronica)

00:54.137 --> 00:55.263
You called the cops on me?

00:55.305 --> 00:56.849
- No. I did.

00:56.891 --> 00:58.141
You shouldn't

00:56.891 --> 00:58.141
have come here.

00:58.183 --> 00:59.309
And you shouldn't

00:58.183 --> 00:59.309
have lied to me.

00:59.351 --> 01:00.185
Get off me.

01:00.227 --> 01:01.102
- Leave her alone.

01:03.230 --> 01:04.940
(Grunting)

01:04.982 --> 01:06.734
- Aah!

01:13.782 --> 01:15.743
(Group chatters)

01:15.784 --> 01:17.160
- Sorry, windmill.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.829
Hey, hey, hey.

01:18.871 --> 01:20.706
Check this out.

01:20.748 --> 01:22.374
Surprise.

01:23.124 --> 01:24.209
Hello, everyone.

01:24.543 --> 01:25.878
-Wait, what?

01:24.543 --> 01:25.878
-What?

01:25.920 --> 01:27.212
So, uh-

01:27.254 --> 01:30.465
Oh, that's T-paint,

01:27.254 --> 01:30.465
Two Canz, Beyonspray...

01:30.507 --> 01:31.174
Veronika!

01:31.216 --> 01:32.133
What?

01:32.175 --> 01:33.510
He's Captain Man's budge.

01:34.720 --> 01:35.554
Hey.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.265
I'm a lot more than just

01:36.346 --> 01:38.265
Captain Man's budge.

01:39.474 --> 01:42.019
For example,

01:39.474 --> 01:42.019
I'm good at tennis.

01:42.978 --> 01:44.813
I make excellent tacos.

01:44.855 --> 01:46.231
Tacos?

01:46.273 --> 01:48.191
What if he tells Captain Man

01:46.273 --> 01:48.191
where we are?

01:48.233 --> 01:49.401
He won't.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.903
I just watched him

01:49.443 --> 01:50.903
fight Captain Man

01:50.945 --> 01:52.404
and push him

01:50.945 --> 01:52.404
down a mountain.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.405
I'd be in jail right now

01:53.447 --> 01:54.949
if it wasn't for him.

01:54.990 --> 01:56.241
- So, what are you saying now?

01:56.283 --> 01:58.243
You're not Captain Man's

01:56.283 --> 01:58.243
budge anymore?

01:59.078 --> 02:00.328
Nope.

02:00.370 --> 02:01.663
I think it's awesome

02:01.705 --> 02:02.873
how you guys go around

02:02.915 --> 02:04.124
painting stuff like that

02:04.165 --> 02:04.875
all over the city.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.045
(Girl)

02:06.710 --> 02:08.045
Wait!

02:08.087 --> 02:09.337
You seriously going to

02:08.087 --> 02:09.337
let Wonder Boy roll with us?

02:11.339 --> 02:12.382
I don't know.

02:12.424 --> 02:14.134
He's my friend.

02:14.175 --> 02:15.761
You don't tell

02:14.175 --> 02:15.761
me what to do.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.679
No.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.679
But Van Del does.

02:17.721 --> 02:18.346
Call him.

02:18.388 --> 02:19.098
On it.

02:22.142 --> 02:26.814
(Phone ringing)

02:26.855 --> 02:27.815
Hello?

02:27.856 --> 02:28.774
Who is this?

02:28.816 --> 02:30.109
Me, man!

02:33.194 --> 02:34.863
(Tube beeping)

02:38.575 --> 02:39.326
How did it go?

02:39.743 --> 02:41.161
Not great.

02:41.202 --> 02:42.871
Well, what happened?

02:42.913 --> 02:44.331
And why are you all dirty?

02:44.372 --> 02:46.166
Because I just went tumbling

02:44.372 --> 02:46.166
down a giant mountain.

02:46.917 --> 02:48.710
And a mountain is basically

02:46.917 --> 02:48.710
one big pile of dirt

02:48.752 --> 02:50.671
in the shape of a mountain.

02:51.463 --> 02:53.132
We've got to locate Henry.

02:53.841 --> 02:54.633
Schwoz!

02:55.258 --> 02:56.802
Schwoz!

02:57.761 --> 02:58.637
Thanks for that.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.473
What, what?

03:03.017 --> 03:04.643
I was in the shower.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.520
Come help us locate Henry.

03:06.561 --> 03:07.395
(Schwoz)

03:06.561 --> 03:07.395
Why, what happened?

03:08.313 --> 03:09.731
I put the secret

03:08.313 --> 03:09.731
tracking device on him,

03:09.773 --> 03:11.399
but it's not finding

03:09.773 --> 03:11.399
the location.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.943
Move.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.943
You don't know anything.

03:19.867 --> 03:20.617
Gah.

03:20.659 --> 03:21.409
Ugh.

03:22.619 --> 03:23.578
(Captain Man)

03:22.619 --> 03:23.578
So, where is he?

03:24.203 --> 03:25.956
It takes time

03:24.203 --> 03:25.956
to triangulate his location.

03:27.499 --> 03:29.918
(Oinking)

03:30.711 --> 03:32.546
I'll be there in a minute!

03:34.798 --> 03:35.966
You were in the shower

03:36.008 --> 03:36.758
with your pig?

03:36.800 --> 03:38.886
She has to get clean, too.

03:40.971 --> 03:42.430
It all just kind of happened.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.599
My dad was

03:42.472 --> 03:44.599
an irresponsible scientist.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.643
I wanted an afterschool job.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.103
(Captain Man)

03:46.685 --> 03:48.103
And by accident,

03:48.145 --> 03:49.354
he made me indestructible.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.814
Ah!

03:50.856 --> 03:52.607
(Henry)

03:50.856 --> 03:52.607
I went into this crazy store

03:53.358 --> 03:54.943
and met a pretty

03:53.358 --> 03:54.943
interesting guy.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.611
I'm going to blow your mind.

03:56.653 --> 03:59.198
(Captain Man)

03:56.653 --> 03:59.198
Now I protect the good

03:56.653 --> 03:59.198
citizens of Swellview.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.157
Who'll call me...

04:00.199 --> 04:01.408
He turned out to be...

04:01.449 --> 04:02.492
You know the name.

04:02.534 --> 04:03.577
Captain Man!

04:03.618 --> 04:04.870
That's right, Henry.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.329
(Captain Man)

04:04.912 --> 04:06.329
In time, I realized that

04:06.371 --> 04:08.665
being a superhero

04:06.371 --> 04:08.665
is a lot to handle alone.

04:08.707 --> 04:10.167
He wanted some help.

04:10.209 --> 04:11.459
(Captain Man)

04:10.209 --> 04:11.459
I needed a sidekick.

04:11.501 --> 04:12.878
I, Henry Hart...

04:12.920 --> 04:14.546
Pledge to never ever ever

04:12.920 --> 04:14.546
tell anyone...

04:14.588 --> 04:16.131
That I'm Captain Man's

04:14.588 --> 04:16.131
secret sidekick.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.007
It is done.

04:17.049 --> 04:18.425
(Henry)

04:17.049 --> 04:18.425
Now we blow bubbles.

04:18.466 --> 04:19.718
(Captain Man)

04:18.466 --> 04:19.718
And fight crime.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.802
(Henry)

04:19.760 --> 04:20.802
Feels good.

04:35.109 --> 04:36.110
Call it.

04:36.151 --> 04:37.819
Up the tube!

04:38.528 --> 04:39.446
Oh, my boot.

04:39.780 --> 04:40.781
(Captain Man)

04:39.780 --> 04:40.781
Ha!

04:49.497 --> 04:50.207
Van Del?

04:50.249 --> 04:52.709
I'm busy painting.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.255
But spray-z wants

04:54.128 --> 04:56.255
to talk to you.

04:58.715 --> 04:59.800
Give me the phone.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.385
Now, go stir the paint

05:02.427 --> 05:04.263
before I throw you into it.

05:10.852 --> 05:11.728
Talk.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.564
Kid Danger's here.

05:16.275 --> 05:17.442
Put him on the phone.

05:22.530 --> 05:23.657
Van Del?

05:23.698 --> 05:25.242
<i>(Van Del)</i>

05:23.698 --> 05:25.242
<i>Kid Danger.</i>

05:25.284 --> 05:27.828
I hear your boss

05:25.284 --> 05:27.828
wants me in prison.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.080
<i>(Kid Danger)</i>

05:28.954 --> 05:30.080
<i>Well...</i>

05:30.122 --> 05:32.791
Maybe Captain Man's

05:30.122 --> 05:32.791
not my boss anymore.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.794
Interesting.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.004
Put spray-z on the phone.

05:37.045 --> 05:37.712
<i>(Kid Danger)</i>

05:37.045 --> 05:37.712
<i>Okay.</i>

05:38.046 --> 05:39.214
Spray-z, he wants you.

05:39.256 --> 05:40.465
I'm Two Canz.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.676
Well, sorry Ms. Canz.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.344
Give me the phone.

05:46.513 --> 05:47.597
It's me.

05:47.639 --> 05:49.766
Did you search Kid Danger?

05:51.268 --> 05:52.686
Search him for what?

05:52.727 --> 05:53.854
<i>(Van Del)</i>

05:52.727 --> 05:53.854
<i>Oh, I don't know,</i>

05:53.895 --> 05:55.730
meatballs and bikini tops?

05:56.564 --> 05:57.816
On it.

05:57.858 --> 05:58.942
Check him for meatballs

05:57.858 --> 05:58.942
and bikini tops.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.320
<i>(Van Del)</i>

05:59.609 --> 06:01.320
<i>Spray-z.</i>

06:01.653 --> 06:02.863
Spray-z!

06:02.904 --> 06:04.114
What's up?

06:04.156 --> 06:06.283
Search him for weapons,

06:06.325 --> 06:08.243
recording devices,

06:06.325 --> 06:08.243
things like that.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.912
Ah, right, right.

06:10.954 --> 06:11.830
<i>(Van Del)</i>

06:10.954 --> 06:11.830
<i>And...</i>

06:12.164 --> 06:13.832
Use the wand.

06:18.461 --> 06:22.423
(Wand buzzing)

06:22.465 --> 06:23.800
(Wand squeals)

06:25.219 --> 06:26.345
(Wand squeals)

06:28.096 --> 06:29.014
(Wand squeals)

06:31.266 --> 06:32.391
What you got in there?

06:32.433 --> 06:34.353
Nothing but rock hard abs.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.646
Check his belt buckle.

06:41.609 --> 06:43.778
I swear I didn't know

06:41.609 --> 06:43.778
that was in there.

06:44.529 --> 06:46.073
It's a tracking device.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.367
Captain Man must've

06:46.990 --> 06:48.367
put it there.

06:48.407 --> 06:49.534
That jerk.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.580
Why can't you find Henry?

06:53.621 --> 06:55.749
I told you, it takes time.

06:55.790 --> 06:58.001
Time is the one thing

06:55.790 --> 06:58.001
we don't have.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.088
Well, time and machines

06:59.127 --> 07:01.088
that poop gold.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.256
We also don't have those.

07:03.382 --> 07:04.091
All right.

07:04.632 --> 07:05.759
If you really didn't know

07:05.800 --> 07:07.010
about this tracking device,

07:07.344 --> 07:08.178
then bust it up.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.100
Okay.

07:13.641 --> 07:14.935
But I don't need this.

07:15.894 --> 07:16.853
Geez.

07:19.189 --> 07:20.232
Check this out.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.367
What happened?

07:30.742 --> 07:32.535
I lost Henry's signal.

07:34.204 --> 07:34.996
Now,

07:35.580 --> 07:37.040
give us your

07:35.580 --> 07:37.040
little laser toy.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.709
But this kind of belongs

07:38.166 --> 07:39.709
to Captain Man,

07:39.751 --> 07:40.543
and I don't think I--

07:40.585 --> 07:41.502
Whose side are you on?

07:42.087 --> 07:43.922
The Wall Dogs'

07:42.087 --> 07:43.922
or Captain Man's?

07:48.176 --> 07:48.927
Yours.

07:49.552 --> 07:50.262
Cool.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.390
Okay you guys finish working

07:50.804 --> 07:53.390
on the windmill.

07:54.682 --> 07:57.144
I'm going to work

07:54.682 --> 07:57.144
on Kid Danger.

07:57.185 --> 07:58.395
What are you going to do?

07:58.437 --> 07:59.271
You'll see.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.440
Hey, how's this

07:59.980 --> 08:01.440
thing work?

08:01.481 --> 08:02.732
Be careful with that

08:01.481 --> 08:02.732
or else you might--

08:02.774 --> 08:04.234
Aah!

08:04.276 --> 08:05.568
My eye!

08:05.902 --> 08:07.112
Hurt yourself.

08:12.951 --> 08:14.494
Okay, you people might be

08:14.535 --> 08:16.413
the worst posse ever.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.373
I mean,

08:18.415 --> 08:20.959
do you want the $10,000

08:18.415 --> 08:20.959
reward or not?

08:21.001 --> 08:22.502
(All)

08:21.001 --> 08:22.502
Yeah.

08:22.543 --> 08:23.837
Then why didn't any of you

08:23.878 --> 08:25.255
find the Wall Dogs?

08:25.297 --> 08:27.215
Well, I was looking

08:25.297 --> 08:27.215
for them downtown.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.301
But when I was crossing

08:27.257 --> 08:29.301
fourth street,

08:29.343 --> 08:30.551
I fell down

08:30.593 --> 08:32.804
and a motorcycle

08:30.593 --> 08:32.804
ran over my tummy.

08:34.764 --> 08:37.267
And why didn't you

08:34.764 --> 08:37.267
find the Wall Dogs?

08:37.309 --> 08:39.353
Well, I saw a bee hive,

08:39.394 --> 08:41.271
so I hit it with a stick.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.731
Then, almost immediately,

08:43.773 --> 08:45.317
I was stung by bees.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.569
Sidney, what's your excuse?

08:49.029 --> 08:50.030
My snake bite...

08:50.905 --> 08:52.615
It's getting worse.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.412
And what about you?

08:57.454 --> 08:59.498
I bought this goldfish.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.707
Why?

09:01.208 --> 09:03.335
I like the way he smells.

09:03.377 --> 09:04.544
(Sniffs)

09:04.585 --> 09:05.920
(Sighs)

09:06.838 --> 09:09.299
Ugh. She is so weird.

09:11.592 --> 09:12.511
Jasper...

09:12.886 --> 09:14.012
You want money, so you can pay

09:14.054 --> 09:15.805
for your foot reduction surgery?

09:16.097 --> 09:17.182
You know I do.

09:17.516 --> 09:18.892
Then all of you

09:18.933 --> 09:21.144
go back out there

09:18.933 --> 09:21.144
and find the Wall Dogs

09:21.186 --> 09:23.271
so we can get our ten grand.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.856
Or die trying.

09:26.316 --> 09:27.567
I'm close.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.198
(Veronika)

09:31.696 --> 09:33.198
Okay, everybody!

09:33.240 --> 09:35.242
Check out the new Kid Danger!

09:36.284 --> 09:37.536
Aw, yeah.

09:37.577 --> 09:38.786
That is dope.

09:38.828 --> 09:39.454
Yeah.

09:38.828 --> 09:39.454
All right.

09:39.496 --> 09:40.288
Woo.

09:40.330 --> 09:41.289
How does it feel?

09:41.331 --> 09:42.582
Feels bad.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.126
Van Del's going to love it.

09:45.168 --> 09:45.960
Yeah, he is.

09:46.002 --> 09:46.878
Oh yeah.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.129
Wow, this is so weird.

09:48.171 --> 09:49.630
I feel like a real

09:48.171 --> 09:49.630
Wall Dog now.

09:49.672 --> 09:50.590
Not yet, man.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.009
We're going to take you

09:51.716 --> 09:53.009
to the grill

09:53.051 --> 09:54.594
and we'll let Van Del decide

09:54.635 --> 09:55.929
if you can be a Wall Dog.

09:56.679 --> 09:57.347
What grill?

09:57.389 --> 09:58.515
That's a secret.

09:58.557 --> 09:59.682
It's the Old Maple Grill.

10:00.683 --> 10:01.518
Shut up, man.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.810
What is wrong with you?

10:02.852 --> 10:04.396
I got shot in the eye

10:02.852 --> 10:04.396
with a laser.

10:04.438 --> 10:05.939
Who points a laser

10:04.438 --> 10:05.939
at their eye?

10:06.981 --> 10:08.525
The Old Maple Grill's

10:06.981 --> 10:08.525
been abandoned for years.

10:09.192 --> 10:09.859
Just wait.

10:10.902 --> 10:12.153
(Jasper)

10:10.902 --> 10:12.153
Quit it. Let me go.

10:12.195 --> 10:14.655
You guys are going

10:12.195 --> 10:14.655
to be in big trouble.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.324
Oh no.

10:16.657 --> 10:17.492
Yo, who's the Herbert?

10:18.243 --> 10:20.412
We caught him across

10:18.243 --> 10:20.412
the street spying on us.

10:20.454 --> 10:21.662
That's right.

10:21.704 --> 10:22.914
And I found you

10:22.956 --> 10:24.416
and as soon as

10:22.956 --> 10:24.416
I get out of here,

10:24.458 --> 10:25.917
I'm calling the cops.

10:26.376 --> 10:27.544
But, but, but...

10:30.046 --> 10:32.299
Well, now, how am I

10:30.046 --> 10:32.299
supposed to call the cops?

10:33.925 --> 10:36.219
I think this Herbert needs

10:33.925 --> 10:36.219
to be a little more...

10:36.719 --> 10:37.678
Colorful.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.097
Let's spray him.

10:39.264 --> 10:40.098
Yeah, let's spray him.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.391
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.391
Hold up.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.268
Why don't we let

10:41.724 --> 10:43.268
our new friend

10:43.310 --> 10:44.561
spray the Herbert?

10:44.978 --> 10:45.979
Okay.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.355
(All)

10:46.020 --> 10:47.355
-Okay.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.355
-What a good idea.

10:47.397 --> 10:48.315
-Like that idea.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.569
Give me some cans.

10:52.611 --> 10:53.903
Whoo.

10:53.945 --> 10:54.862
Yeah.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.030
Kid Danger.

10:56.490 --> 10:57.282
What's up?

10:58.283 --> 10:59.284
What happened

10:58.283 --> 10:59.284
to your outfit?

10:59.326 --> 11:01.536
None of your biz,

10:59.326 --> 11:01.536
Herbert.

11:02.036 --> 11:02.912
(All)

11:02.036 --> 11:02.912
Ooh.

11:02.954 --> 11:04.205
Yeah.

11:02.954 --> 11:04.205
All right.

11:04.247 --> 11:05.540
What are you doing?

11:05.582 --> 11:07.501
You're supposed to fight

11:05.582 --> 11:07.501
for what's good and right.

11:07.542 --> 11:08.918
Things change.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.087
Now I spray paint

11:08.960 --> 11:11.087
herberts with big feet.

11:11.129 --> 11:12.088
Yeah.

11:12.130 --> 11:13.465
No, no, no.

11:12.130 --> 11:13.465
Don't paint me.

11:13.507 --> 11:14.966
Aah. No.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.050
It's so cold.

11:16.510 --> 11:17.969
Not my neck.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.304
Not my pants.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.514
Not my pants.

11:20.555 --> 11:21.931
My pants.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.687
What happened to you?

11:31.274 --> 11:32.775
Kid Danger.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.152
He painted me.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.737
Oh, please.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.114
There's no way Kid Danger

11:38.156 --> 11:40.033
would ever do

11:38.156 --> 11:40.033
anything bad or mean.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.742
That's what I thought.

11:41.784 --> 11:42.952
But he's different now.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.539
He painted me everywhere.

11:45.872 --> 11:46.540
Even--

11:46.581 --> 11:47.290
Everywhere.

11:49.459 --> 11:50.460
(Groaning)

11:51.002 --> 11:51.710
- Hey.

11:52.295 --> 11:53.254
(Grunts)

11:54.839 --> 11:55.882
Has anyone seen Henry?

11:55.923 --> 11:56.591
(All)

11:55.923 --> 11:56.591
No.

11:56.633 --> 11:57.300
- Not at all.

11:59.511 --> 12:00.554
Whoa.

12:00.595 --> 12:02.721
Jasper, did a clown

12:00.595 --> 12:02.721
throw up on you?

12:03.640 --> 12:04.891
I wish.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.227
Kid Danger did this.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.562
You saw Kid Danger?

12:08.603 --> 12:11.356
Yeah.

12:08.603 --> 12:11.356
With the Wall Dogs

12:08.603 --> 12:11.356
over at Big Putts.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.315
Are they still there?

12:12.357 --> 12:13.316
No.

12:13.732 --> 12:15.734
Can I use your shower

12:13.732 --> 12:15.734
to get this paint off me?

12:15.776 --> 12:17.445
There's a hose on the porch.

12:18.905 --> 12:19.656
Come with me.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.117
- Aah!

12:23.577 --> 12:26.287
Ugh, I feel so sticky.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.331
All right, Jasper,

12:28.373 --> 12:29.666
get your shirt off.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.501
Can't believe I

12:29.708 --> 12:31.501
just said that.

12:32.627 --> 12:33.794
Hey, Jasper,

12:33.836 --> 12:35.088
we all just took a vote.

12:35.129 --> 12:36.130
You're out of the posse.

12:37.424 --> 12:38.049
What?

12:38.633 --> 12:40.051
If we find the Wall Dogs

12:40.093 --> 12:42.095
and get the $10,000 reward,

12:42.470 --> 12:43.388
you get nothing.

12:46.683 --> 12:47.684
Great.

12:47.726 --> 12:48.976
Now I'll never get enough money

12:49.018 --> 12:50.769
for foot reduction surgery.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.858
O-M-G.

12:56.276 --> 12:56.984
What?

12:57.611 --> 12:58.777
What's on my back?

13:00.280 --> 13:02.865
O-M-G.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.452
What?

13:03.824 --> 13:05.452
Is it a mole?

13:06.202 --> 13:08.329
You're sure Kid Danger

13:06.202 --> 13:08.329
did this to you?

13:08.622 --> 13:09.539
Yeah.

13:11.499 --> 13:12.166
Bye.

13:12.500 --> 13:13.376
Wait!

13:14.377 --> 13:16.254
I thought you were

13:14.377 --> 13:16.254
going to hose me off!

13:19.840 --> 13:21.800
Kid Danger?

13:19.840 --> 13:21.800
He's here?

13:21.842 --> 13:22.843
Yeah.

13:22.885 --> 13:23.720
He's outside with Veronika.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.054
Bring him.

13:25.096 --> 13:25.722
Get him.

13:25.764 --> 13:26.514
Get him!

13:28.516 --> 13:29.183
Oh, I get him.

13:37.275 --> 13:38.234
How's your eye?

13:38.568 --> 13:39.778
Gone.

13:44.991 --> 13:45.992
Van Del?

13:46.033 --> 13:46.867
Is it true,

13:47.577 --> 13:49.537
you've turned

13:47.577 --> 13:49.537
against Captain Man

13:49.579 --> 13:52.373
and that you want to join

13:49.579 --> 13:52.373
the Wall Dogs revolution?

13:54.626 --> 13:55.918
Yep. I do.

13:56.252 --> 13:57.878
Roll up your sleeve.

13:59.589 --> 14:00.590
Why?

14:01.257 --> 14:04.010
Show him the Wall Dog

14:01.257 --> 14:04.010
mark on your arms.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.015
Oh.

14:12.018 --> 14:15.772
First, we test the melon.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.871
So, to join the Wall Dogs,

14:31.912 --> 14:33.832
now I have to do

14:31.912 --> 14:33.832
that to a melon?

14:33.873 --> 14:35.542
(Chuckles)

14:35.834 --> 14:37.084
Hold up your arm.

14:37.669 --> 14:39.253
Whoa, whoa.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.381
Couldn't I just swear

14:39.295 --> 14:41.381
on a Bible or something?

14:42.173 --> 14:42.923
Or if--

14:44.467 --> 14:45.343
Ow!

14:48.805 --> 14:49.681
Dang it!

14:52.433 --> 14:54.060
Aw, seriously?

14:54.853 --> 14:56.437
Ah, I know.

15:02.276 --> 15:04.278
(Grunting)

15:09.950 --> 15:11.327
It's Captain Man.

15:18.793 --> 15:20.127
Well, Van Del,

15:20.961 --> 15:22.296
spray time's over.

15:24.382 --> 15:27.635
Prove your loyalty

15:24.382 --> 15:27.635
to the Wall Dogs.

15:27.677 --> 15:28.469
(Kid Danger sighs)

15:31.222 --> 15:33.015
I've only got one

15:31.222 --> 15:33.015
thing to say to you.

15:33.725 --> 15:34.517
Then say it.

15:36.561 --> 15:38.479
I am so glad you're here.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.820
Hey, what are you doing?

15:45.862 --> 15:47.405
Fighting crime, baby.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.032
I love this kid.

15:50.617 --> 15:51.785
You lied to me.

15:51.826 --> 15:52.827
Yep.

15:52.869 --> 15:53.787
You used me.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.037
That is also true.

15:56.790 --> 15:57.665
She is really pretty.

15:57.707 --> 15:58.499
Right?

16:00.209 --> 16:01.961
But how could you...

16:02.921 --> 16:04.964
Look, I had to

16:02.921 --> 16:04.964
make you think

16:05.005 --> 16:06.424
that I turned

16:05.005 --> 16:06.424
against Captain Man

16:06.466 --> 16:07.884
and that I was falling

16:06.466 --> 16:07.884
in love with you

16:07.926 --> 16:09.385
so you'd bring me

16:07.926 --> 16:09.385
here to Van Del.

16:10.386 --> 16:11.679
You idiot.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.098
You led Captain Man

16:12.430 --> 16:14.098
right to us.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.600
It wasn't my fault.

16:15.642 --> 16:16.976
When we found the tracking

16:15.642 --> 16:16.976
device on the kid,

16:17.017 --> 16:17.894
we blew it up.

16:18.227 --> 16:18.895
(Kid Danger)

16:18.227 --> 16:18.895
Yeah.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.897
And that's when I knew

16:19.520 --> 16:20.897
I had to get a message

16:20.939 --> 16:21.815
to Captain Man

16:21.856 --> 16:23.357
so I spray painted O-M-G

16:23.399 --> 16:25.485
on that kid you guys

16:23.399 --> 16:25.485
caught at Big Putts.

16:25.526 --> 16:26.778
You mean the kid

16:25.526 --> 16:26.778
with the big feet?

16:26.820 --> 16:27.779
Uh-huh.

16:28.154 --> 16:28.863
But his feet aren't big.

16:28.905 --> 16:29.948
They're huge.

16:31.658 --> 16:32.659
Wait.

16:32.700 --> 16:33.701
I still don't

16:32.700 --> 16:33.701
understand all this.

16:33.743 --> 16:34.619
What?

16:34.661 --> 16:35.829
You mean that

16:34.661 --> 16:35.829
Kid Danger and I

16:35.870 --> 16:37.204
set up a whole

16:35.870 --> 16:37.204
plan to find

16:37.246 --> 16:38.790
your secret hideout here

16:37.246 --> 16:38.790
and capture Van Del?

16:39.123 --> 16:41.083
(Crowd muttering)

16:41.125 --> 16:42.794
(Both sighing)

16:42.836 --> 16:44.253
All right.

16:44.295 --> 16:46.046
We'll explain it

16:44.295 --> 16:46.046
in more detail.

16:48.424 --> 16:51.135
And so when I saw the O-M-G

16:51.177 --> 16:52.052
that Kid Danger sprayed

16:52.094 --> 16:53.304
on that boy's back,

16:53.346 --> 16:55.181
I knew that was a clue.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.268
Old Maple Grille. O-M-G.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.856
(Crowd ohs)

17:02.897 --> 17:04.273
(Girl)

17:02.897 --> 17:04.273
Wait.

17:04.315 --> 17:06.066
When did you guys even

17:04.315 --> 17:06.066
come up with this whole plan?

17:06.108 --> 17:06.985
Well, you see,

17:07.026 --> 17:07.986
at first I lied

17:07.026 --> 17:07.986
to Captain Man.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.111
(Captain Man)

17:08.027 --> 17:09.111
By not telling me

17:09.153 --> 17:10.404
that Veronika asked

17:09.153 --> 17:10.404
him to meet her

17:10.446 --> 17:11.823
under the Swellview sign.

17:11.865 --> 17:12.615
But then I felt guilty

17:12.657 --> 17:13.574
so I told him.

17:13.616 --> 17:14.575
Who's a good boy?

17:14.617 --> 17:15.368
Me.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.454
So that's when we

17:17.161 --> 17:18.454
decided to really--

17:18.496 --> 17:19.789
Stop this.

17:20.999 --> 17:23.751
This explanation has been

17:23.793 --> 17:28.130
going on for 45 minutes.

17:29.549 --> 17:30.717
Enough.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.344
Well, what do you

17:31.885 --> 17:33.344
want us to do?

17:33.386 --> 17:35.262
Attack them.

17:41.853 --> 17:43.145
Hey, Captain Man!

17:46.315 --> 17:46.983
- Ha.

17:53.614 --> 17:54.615
Get up.

17:53.614 --> 17:54.615
Get him.

18:13.051 --> 18:14.010
Where you going?

18:15.302 --> 18:16.178
I'm sorry,

18:16.220 --> 18:17.013
but we got to

18:16.220 --> 18:17.013
keep you here

18:17.055 --> 18:17.805
until the cops show up.

18:19.849 --> 18:20.683
Really?

18:20.725 --> 18:22.142
Is that the truth?

18:22.518 --> 18:23.895
What do you mean?

18:23.937 --> 18:25.730
Everything you've told me

18:23.937 --> 18:25.730
up to now has been a lie.

18:25.772 --> 18:26.689
We had to stop you

18:26.731 --> 18:27.523
and the other Wall Dogs

18:27.565 --> 18:28.566
from breaking the law.

18:28.608 --> 18:29.316
Well,

18:30.317 --> 18:31.819
you're a really good actor.

18:33.071 --> 18:34.196
Because the way

18:33.071 --> 18:34.196
you kissed me,

18:36.156 --> 18:37.951
I thought maybe

18:36.156 --> 18:37.951
you liked it...

18:38.952 --> 18:40.119
And liked me.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.126
What are you doing?

18:47.794 --> 18:49.087
I don't know,

18:49.128 --> 18:51.171
but I sure hope

18:49.128 --> 18:51.171
you don't escape

18:51.213 --> 18:53.841
while I'm looking

18:51.213 --> 18:53.841
at this cool ceiling.

18:56.510 --> 18:57.428
Whoa.

18:57.470 --> 18:58.304
So close.

18:58.345 --> 18:59.472
Oh. Not quite.

19:12.526 --> 19:13.987
Huh. Yeah.

19:18.908 --> 19:19.742
Don't come near me.

19:19.784 --> 19:21.201
I'm coming near you.

19:21.786 --> 19:22.620
Leave me alone.

19:23.079 --> 19:24.956
Nope, here I come.

19:28.751 --> 19:31.253
I am an artist.

19:31.796 --> 19:33.380
You're a criminal.

19:40.054 --> 19:42.264
Aah! I'm drowning!

19:43.141 --> 19:45.351
I'm drowning in my own paint!

19:45.392 --> 19:46.102
(Both)

19:45.392 --> 19:46.102
Hey!

19:46.144 --> 19:47.145
Hey, hey, hey!

19:47.186 --> 19:48.688
It's only, like,

19:47.186 --> 19:48.688
three feet deep.

19:48.729 --> 19:49.396
You can stand up.

19:50.898 --> 19:51.983
Oh.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.485
This is so embarrassing.

19:56.029 --> 19:56.737
Yeah.

19:56.779 --> 19:57.697
It really is.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.451
<i>We are live at</i>

20:00.366 --> 20:02.451
<i>the Old Maple Grill</i>

20:02.493 --> 20:03.703
<i>where Captain Man</i>

20:02.493 --> 20:03.703
<i>and Kid Danger</i>

20:03.744 --> 20:05.913
<i>just captured</i>

20:03.744 --> 20:05.913
<i>the graffiti bandits</i>

20:05.955 --> 20:07.623
<i>known as the Wall Dogs.</i>

20:07.665 --> 20:09.416
Dang it.

20:07.665 --> 20:09.416
Oh.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.044
Shh.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.044
I want to hear this.

20:11.085 --> 20:12.294
<i>So, what do you</i>

20:11.085 --> 20:12.294
<i>guys plan to do</i>

20:12.336 --> 20:13.046

20:13.546 --> 20:15.089
<i>Well, the truth is,</i>

20:15.131 --> 20:16.841
<i>we never would have</i>

20:15.131 --> 20:16.841

20:16.883 --> 20:19.135

20:21.470 --> 20:23.139

20:23.556 --> 20:25.099
<i>His name is Jasper Dunlop.</i>

20:26.059 --> 20:26.767
What?

20:27.393 --> 20:28.435
They're talking about me.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.021
How did you tip them off?

20:30.063 --> 20:31.064
I don't know

20:31.105 --> 20:32.190
and I don't care.

20:32.272 --> 20:33.816
They're talking about me.

20:33.858 --> 20:36.443
<i>So, we're going to</i>

20:33.858 --> 20:36.443
<i>take the $10,000 reward</i>

20:36.485 --> 20:38.029
<i>and give it to Jasper.</i>

20:38.362 --> 20:39.446
- Yes.

20:39.488 --> 20:40.948
Whoo.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.033
I did it.

20:42.075 --> 20:42.909
I won.

20:42.950 --> 20:43.993
(Laughs)

20:44.744 --> 20:47.830
Now I can get

20:44.744 --> 20:47.830
foot reduction surgery.

20:49.415 --> 20:51.000
Sidney, did you hear that?

20:51.042 --> 20:51.959
Sidney.

20:54.212 --> 20:55.755
I want to live.

21:11.896 --> 21:13.814
- Well, look who's here.

21:15.983 --> 21:17.610
I had a feeling you

21:15.983 --> 21:17.610
might be hanging around.

21:18.069 --> 21:19.319
You mean...

21:19.361 --> 21:20.738
You hoped I'd be?

21:21.530 --> 21:23.866
Did you hope I'd come here?

21:24.700 --> 21:26.077
You always answer a question

21:26.119 --> 21:26.869
with a question?

21:27.286 --> 21:28.788
What do you think?

21:30.539 --> 21:33.542
(Helicopter whirring)

21:33.584 --> 21:34.501
<i>Ha.</i>

21:34.543 --> 21:36.129
<i>We got our light fixed.</i>

21:36.170 --> 21:37.630
<i>Ha, ha.</i>

21:39.215 --> 21:40.133
<i>No.</i>

21:40.591 --> 21:41.175
<i>Fly away.</i>

21:41.217 --> 21:42.093
<i>Fly away.</i>

21:46.346 --> 21:47.932
Promise me,

21:47.974 --> 21:49.725
no more spray painting

21:47.974 --> 21:49.725
other people's property.

21:50.726 --> 21:51.727
Pinky swear.

22:33.060 --> 22:34.020
(Ding)

22:34.061 --> 22:34.854
Mm.
