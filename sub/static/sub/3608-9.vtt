WEBVTT

01:02.020 --> 01:04.230
Sorry, man. I know this hurts.

01:08.277 --> 01:12.113
Michael told me you pulled
the bullet out with your bare hands.

01:12.197 --> 01:15.324
You'll have to show me
how to do that sometime.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.411
Where is she?

01:20.122 --> 01:22.248
- What? I didn't...
- Where is she?

01:23.667 --> 01:28.254
You mean Kate? She's been watching
over you for the past 24 hours straight.

01:28.338 --> 01:31.966
Only way I could get rid of her
was to send her to get food for you.

01:39.475 --> 01:41.517
I love her.

03:09.898 --> 03:12.775
Hey, girl. What are you doing here?

03:17.614 --> 03:20.783
- Hey, there.
- All right. Let's get you to bed.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.919
Watch your step.
Watch your step.

03:34.423 --> 03:36.591
What the hell is that smell?

03:36.675 --> 03:39.135
- Probably your breath.
- Yeah, right.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.512
- Come on.
- Wow.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.981
You're beautiful.

03:54.151 --> 03:55.818
Hey.

03:57.279 --> 03:59.989
Hey. I just gave you a compliment.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.825
Yeah. I heard you.

04:06.955 --> 04:09.665
Aren't you gonna
take my pants off first?

04:18.257 --> 04:20.384
You are beautiful.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.851
Good night.

05:40.924 --> 05:43.175
Coffee? Pie? Both?

05:43.260 --> 05:46.095
- How about a beer?
- I'd like to see some ID.

05:47.139 --> 05:48.764
I'm 24, Ma.

05:48.849 --> 05:52.059
You wanna ride on that death trap
of yours without a helmet,

05:52.144 --> 05:55.187
I'm not gonna help your cause
by getting you drunk.

06:01.737 --> 06:05.114
- How's that wrist?
- What? This?

06:07.075 --> 06:10.202
You know that shelf in the kitchen
sticks out sometimes.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.997
- You'd think I'd remember it was there.
- Don't.

06:21.256 --> 06:23.591
I made my bed, Katherine.

06:24.509 --> 06:26.552
Well, your bed's gone, Ma.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.971
What?

06:36.605 --> 06:38.481
What is this?

06:38.565 --> 06:41.233
- An insurance policy for the house.
- I never...

06:41.318 --> 06:43.819
I took it out in your name.

06:49.534 --> 06:51.744
What did you do?

06:51.828 --> 06:54.246
Does Wayne know about this?

06:58.335 --> 07:01.045
Just remember you were here
and you didn't see me.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.672
Katherine! What did you do?

07:04.466 --> 07:06.509
I took care of you, Ma.

07:08.178 --> 07:11.514
I gotta go.
You're not gonna see me for a while.

07:23.360 --> 07:26.445
Katherine. What did you do?

07:27.864 --> 07:29.740
Katherine!

07:35.038 --> 07:37.164
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.627
You OK?

07:41.711 --> 07:46.048
Yeah, yeah, I think I'm just...
I think I'm tired.

07:49.928 --> 07:52.388
- How is he?
- Fever's still up there.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.474
Can't tell if the antibiotics
are working.

07:55.559 --> 07:58.269
It'll help to get some food in him.

07:58.353 --> 08:02.189
You should get down to the beach
for Shannon.

08:04.401 --> 08:07.778
I was actually thinking
that I should stay and watch Sawyer.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.739
I'll stay with him.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.367
You should be there.

08:19.082 --> 08:23.127
Keep him hydrated. Maybe mash up some
fruit and see if you can get him to eat.

08:23.253 --> 08:27.006
Everybody will be at the beach,
so don't forget the button.

08:27.090 --> 08:28.591
I've got it.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.427
- I'll be back in a couple hours.
- Yep.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.765
You're sure you're OK?

08:38.434 --> 08:40.561
Yeah. I'm great.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.493
Hey.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.499
I'm going to go to the funeral.

09:07.297 --> 09:09.506
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

09:19.893 --> 09:23.062
I think most of them realize
it was an accident, Ana.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.524
Shannon and I were strangers.

10:10.402 --> 10:12.736
We never would have met if...

10:17.826 --> 10:20.202
We wouldn't even have spoken if...

10:26.209 --> 10:28.335
But we did meet.

10:29.379 --> 10:31.630
And we did speak.

10:35.885 --> 10:37.970
At least.

10:48.231 --> 10:50.482
I loved her.

11:28.897 --> 11:31.231
May she rest in peace.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.384
You hungry?

11:58.510 --> 12:01.220
I'm just gonna mash you up
some fruit here.

12:03.431 --> 12:07.601
When you wake up, you're gonna get a
kick out of me feeding you like a baby.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.650
I saw a horse.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.405
Yeah.

12:19.489 --> 12:22.366
That's what happens
when you don't sleep.

12:32.544 --> 12:35.087
Sawyer? You awake?

12:40.969 --> 12:42.428
You killed me.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.140
Why did you kill me?

12:54.149 --> 12:56.024
It's the alarm.

12:58.319 --> 13:01.321
Kate!

13:09.581 --> 13:11.248
Sawyer!

13:13.960 --> 13:16.211
4, 8...

13:16.296 --> 13:18.505
Fifteen, 16, 2...

13:24.554 --> 13:25.888
Forty-two.

13:35.523 --> 13:38.317
- What happened?
- I don't know.

13:38.401 --> 13:40.569
- Well, you said...
- I don't know, John!

13:41.571 --> 13:43.363
Well, where's Kate?

13:46.493 --> 13:48.577
Kate. Hey.

13:49.787 --> 13:53.332
- You missed the funeral.
- Yeah, I was with Sawyer.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.168
Oh, right.

13:56.252 --> 13:59.129
A few of "them" came. The new people.

14:00.590 --> 14:04.426
Not her, the one who killed Shannon.
That would've been a bit awkward.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.929
They seem to have had
a rough time of it.

14:07.096 --> 14:10.349
Looks like they went bloody
Lord of the Flies out there.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.271
You haven't listened to a word
I've said.

14:17.607 --> 14:20.817
- Do you think there are horses here?
- What?

14:21.653 --> 14:23.695
I think I saw a horse in the jungle.

14:25.448 --> 14:27.741
I've seen polar bears.

14:27.825 --> 14:30.786
I've seen monsters.
Well, heard monsters.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.914
But horses? No.

14:34.624 --> 14:37.334
Kate, where are you going?

14:44.926 --> 14:47.135
Tallahassee, one way, please.

14:48.054 --> 14:51.139
Tallahassee? I spent a week
in Tallahassee one night.

14:51.975 --> 14:55.185
It's all strip malls and waffle houses.

14:55.270 --> 14:58.522
What's a pretty girl like you
gonna do down in Tallahassee?

14:58.606 --> 15:02.359
- I'm sure I'll find something.
- Bet you've got family down there.

15:02.485 --> 15:04.611
Actually, I'm just visiting.

15:07.240 --> 15:11.243
Hey.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.538
Don't I know you?

15:22.547 --> 15:24.673
No, I don't think so.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.551
Don't run, Kate.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.059
I got her.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.687
Kate Austen,
you're under arrest for murder.

15:38.813 --> 15:40.939
- I didn't do anything.
- Yeah, you did.

15:41.024 --> 15:43.317
Your mama gave you up, Kate.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.833
Charlie. Have you seen Kate?

16:00.418 --> 16:02.461
A little while ago in the jungle.

16:02.545 --> 16:05.631
She was acting kind of barmy,
asking me about horses.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.966
You know where she is now?

16:08.051 --> 16:10.886
She's on the path
heading back to the caves.

16:13.222 --> 16:16.433
- Everything OK?
- Yeah, Charlie. Everything's fine.

16:29.364 --> 16:32.658
- Thank you.
- Free at last, huh?

16:42.043 --> 16:44.670
Yeah, man. Looks good.

16:53.554 --> 16:56.848
Hey, Locke,
what's up with the blast doors?

16:58.267 --> 16:59.935
Blast doors?

17:01.479 --> 17:07.108
Yeah. Like, in case of an explosion,
they come from the ceiling.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.861
- That guy down here...
- Desmond?

17:09.945 --> 17:14.281
- He didn't tell you what they were for?
- No. No, he didn't.

17:16.868 --> 17:19.287
But he did leave a movie.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.873
- A movie?
- Yeah.

17:22.916 --> 17:25.460
You wanna see it?

17:25.545 --> 17:27.421
I would like to see it, too.

17:31.092 --> 17:33.176
If you don't mind.

17:36.472 --> 17:39.099
Why not? The more, the merrier.

17:54.532 --> 17:57.701
Kate, what the hell
are you doing out here?

18:00.705 --> 18:03.665
What happened in the hatch, Kate?
Why did you leave?

18:03.750 --> 18:06.543
I find Sawyer on the ground.
You just took off...

18:06.627 --> 18:09.588
- Is he OK?
- Yes, Kate, he's fine.

18:13.509 --> 18:16.428
- I'm sorry.
- Are you?

18:20.558 --> 18:22.517
Yeah, I'm sorry.

18:22.643 --> 18:25.771
I'm sorry that I am not
as perfect as you.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.190
I'm sorry that I'm not as good!

18:29.942 --> 18:32.444
- What's going on with you?
- Just forget it.

18:32.528 --> 18:34.696
- Don't walk away from me.
- Let go of me.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.531
- No. Kate.
- Don't!

18:37.158 --> 18:39.284
It's OK. It's OK.

18:40.203 --> 18:41.453
Hey.

18:41.537 --> 18:44.706
Jack. This place is crazy. It's just...

18:45.875 --> 18:48.710
I can't... It's driving me nuts.

18:48.836 --> 18:50.921
I know. It's OK.

18:51.005 --> 18:54.090
It's all right. It's all right.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.718
All right?

19:40.429 --> 19:41.805
Kate!

19:46.435 --> 19:48.728
From the moment the alarm sounds,

19:48.855 --> 19:54.025
you will have four minutes to enter the
code into the microcomputer processor...

19:54.110 --> 19:56.111
...induction into the program.

19:56.195 --> 20:01.116
When the alarm sounds, either you
or your partner must input the code.

20:01.951 --> 20:06.204
It is highly recommended that you and
your partner take alternating shifts.

20:06.289 --> 20:09.291
In this manner,
you will both stay as fresh and alert...

20:09.417 --> 20:12.335
...utmost importance
that when the alarm sounds,

20:12.461 --> 20:16.172
the code be entered correctly
and in a timely fashion.

20:16.257 --> 20:19.926
Do not attempt to use
the computer for anything...

20:20.636 --> 20:22.387
Congratulations.

20:22.471 --> 20:27.309
Until your replacements arrive, the
future of the project is in your hands.

20:27.435 --> 20:30.520
On behalf of the DeGroots, Alvar Hanso,

20:30.646 --> 20:33.189
and all of us at the Dharma Initiative,

20:33.316 --> 20:38.486
thank you, namaste, and good luck.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.242
All right.

20:44.327 --> 20:49.080
So, you've been pushing that button
every two hours since you got down here?

20:49.165 --> 20:50.832
That's right.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.543
How's that even work?

20:53.669 --> 20:57.756
I've set up two-person shifts.
Six hours. Everyone's on the roster.

20:59.175 --> 21:01.009
Don't they wanna know why?

21:01.093 --> 21:03.595
I think the film's
pretty self-explanatory.

21:03.679 --> 21:08.683
Really? All I heard was something
about electromagnets and an "incident."

21:08.768 --> 21:10.977
What about all the missing pieces?

21:11.103 --> 21:12.854
You mean the splices?

21:12.980 --> 21:16.024
Just a frame here and there, I think.
Nothing important.

21:16.150 --> 21:18.193
What do you think?

21:20.529 --> 21:22.530
About the film? What do you think?

22:06.993 --> 22:09.494
I'm sorry I missed it. Her funeral.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.997
I had to be with Sawyer, so...

22:13.708 --> 22:16.543
Why aren't you with him now?

22:21.007 --> 22:23.174
Because I'm going crazy.

22:32.101 --> 22:34.269
Do you believe in ghosts, Sayid?

22:37.273 --> 22:41.276
I saw Walt in the jungle,
just before Shannon was shot.

22:52.413 --> 22:54.914
Does that make me crazy?

23:12.266 --> 23:15.810
It's a long drive back
to the arraignment. You comfy?

23:29.533 --> 23:31.659
Why now?

23:34.163 --> 23:37.624
- What?
- Nice, corn-fed farm girl like you.

23:37.708 --> 23:43.213
No history of violence. Straight A's.
No record, couple of speeding tickets.

23:44.423 --> 23:47.008
I just gotta wonder,
why did you kill him now?

23:50.012 --> 23:53.932
Right, yeah, don't tell me. You wouldn't
wanna incriminate yourself.

23:54.016 --> 23:56.476
Not after you were so smart planning it.

23:57.186 --> 24:01.481
That jury back in Iowa sure ain't
gonna get hung up on premeditation.

24:01.565 --> 24:03.691
And a gas leak?

24:03.776 --> 24:07.946
Come on. That's amateur hour
from top to bottom.

24:08.030 --> 24:10.365
Sounds like
you've got it all figured out.

24:10.491 --> 24:14.035
- I have you all figured out.
- You don't know anything about me.

24:14.120 --> 24:18.164
White-trash mom divorces dad, starts up
with some guy who's a drinker.

24:18.249 --> 24:21.668
Maybe he knocks her around a little bit,
so she marries him,

24:21.794 --> 24:24.420
because, you know, that's what happens.

24:25.339 --> 24:28.508
Then this drunk, this Wayne,
he moves into your house.

24:28.592 --> 24:32.220
And you get to lay there every night
and listen to him doing your mom

24:32.304 --> 24:34.722
right there in your daddy's old bedroom.

24:34.849 --> 24:38.476
And even that wouldn't be so bad
if he didn't beat her up all the time.

24:38.561 --> 24:41.563
But she loves him.

24:41.647 --> 24:43.481
She defends him.

24:48.904 --> 24:52.991
If that don't make a person want to kill
somebody, I don't know what does.

24:53.075 --> 24:55.702
But the question is: now, why now?

24:56.912 --> 25:01.583
Why after all these years did you
just decide to blow poor Wayne up?

25:07.548 --> 25:10.133
He come knocking on your door
late at night?

25:11.844 --> 25:14.137
He never touched me.

25:18.309 --> 25:19.934
Look out!

26:22.665 --> 26:24.999
Why can't you just
put the numbers in now?

26:25.084 --> 26:28.586
No. Doesn't work that way.
The alarm goes off at four minutes.

26:28.671 --> 26:30.713
You can't type anything until then.

26:36.762 --> 26:39.264
You mind if I check out
some of this hardware?

26:40.599 --> 26:42.183
Sure.

26:44.019 --> 26:46.062
Just don't break it.

26:57.324 --> 26:59.951
- Hello, again.
- Hello.

27:03.163 --> 27:05.707
I have something I think you should see.

27:12.298 --> 27:15.550
If you don't mind,
I will begin at the beginning.

27:20.472 --> 27:26.019
Long before Christ, the King of Judah
was a man named Josiah.

27:26.895 --> 27:30.023
Boy, when you say "beginning,"
you mean "beginning."

27:32.234 --> 27:37.405
At that time, the temple where
the people worshipped was in ruin.

27:38.574 --> 27:41.117
And so the people worshipped idols.

27:41.618 --> 27:45.663
False gods.
And so, the kingdom was in disarray.

27:46.790 --> 27:50.752
Josiah, since he was a good king,

27:50.836 --> 27:53.796
sent his secretary to the treasury

27:53.881 --> 27:58.426
and said "We must rebuild the temple."

27:58.510 --> 28:02.096
"Give all of the gold to the workers
so that this will be done."

28:03.265 --> 28:08.102
But when the secretary returned,
he had no gold.

28:10.105 --> 28:12.482
And when Josiah asked why this was,

28:13.901 --> 28:16.235
the secretary replied...

28:21.617 --> 28:23.409
"We found a book."

28:26.580 --> 28:30.458
- Do you know this story?
- No. Afraid I don't.

28:31.877 --> 28:36.798
What the secretary had found
was an ancient book.

28:38.801 --> 28:41.052
The Book of Law.

28:42.805 --> 28:45.306
You may know it as the Old Testament.

28:47.184 --> 28:50.311
And it was with that ancient book,

28:51.480 --> 28:53.439
not with the gold,

28:53.524 --> 28:55.942
that Josiah rebuilt the temple.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.740
On the other side of the island...

29:05.577 --> 29:08.079
...we found a place much like this.

29:11.166 --> 29:15.002
And in this place we found a book.

29:28.350 --> 29:32.603
I believe what's inside there
will be of great value to you.

30:25.532 --> 30:26.991
Hey.

30:34.082 --> 30:36.792
So, Rose's husband's white.

30:38.504 --> 30:42.507
- Didn't see that one coming.
- Is there something you need, Hurley?

30:42.591 --> 30:45.510
Nope. Just taking a walk.

30:45.594 --> 30:47.220
Thought I'd say hey.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.600
Who's taking care of Sawyer?

30:52.684 --> 30:54.018
Sun is.

30:54.102 --> 30:56.479
So you're, like, mad at him?

31:00.192 --> 31:02.026
Why would I be mad at Sawyer?

31:02.110 --> 31:05.071
Maybe because he's the one
who always comes down here

31:05.155 --> 31:07.406
and chops wood and now you are.

31:08.534 --> 31:10.785
It's, like, transference.

31:12.037 --> 31:13.287
Are you a shrink now?

31:13.372 --> 31:16.374
That's what they called it
in the mental hospital.

31:17.668 --> 31:19.752
I'm not mad at anyone.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.808
Where's Jack?

31:33.892 --> 31:36.310
I don't know. He didn't come back.

31:38.522 --> 31:40.690
Has he said anything?

31:41.817 --> 31:43.317
Sawyer?

31:44.570 --> 31:47.113
No. He's still sleeping.

31:50.534 --> 31:52.827
Can you watch him?

31:54.454 --> 31:57.873
- I can stay if you...
- No, yeah, I can.

31:57.958 --> 31:59.500
Thanks.

32:21.189 --> 32:22.481
Right.

32:24.192 --> 32:26.944
Yes,
I'm sure that's the exact form you got.

32:30.032 --> 32:32.617
I'll send one over to you, right.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.830
I'll call you back later.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.048
Hi, Dad.

32:50.761 --> 32:53.596
The police and the US Marshals
are looking for you.

32:53.722 --> 32:56.724
- You shouldn't have come.
- I was outside for two hours.

32:56.850 --> 32:59.018
They're not here.

32:59.853 --> 33:02.021
Is it true? What they're saying?

33:07.986 --> 33:09.945
Katie, what did you come here for?

33:13.408 --> 33:15.451
Why didn't you tell me, Dad?

33:16.620 --> 33:18.329
Tell you what?

33:20.248 --> 33:23.918
I was making a scrapbook.
A surprise for your birthday.

33:25.921 --> 33:29.423
So I called one of your COs
to get some pictures of you in uniform.

33:30.467 --> 33:33.094
The pictures he sent me
had dates on the back.

33:33.178 --> 33:37.098
Photos of you in Korea, up until
four months before I was born.

33:43.772 --> 33:46.649
Why didn't you tell me
that Wayne was my father?

33:50.529 --> 33:52.321
Why?

34:00.872 --> 34:03.457
I didn't tell you
because I knew you'd kill him.

34:08.588 --> 34:12.632
And your mother loved him.

34:18.556 --> 34:21.851
You were five years old.
I wanted to take you along with me,

34:21.935 --> 34:23.978
but she wouldn't let me.

34:26.148 --> 34:28.149
So why didn't you kill him?

34:35.574 --> 34:38.117
Because I don't have murder in my heart.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.380
I'm gonna have to call them.

34:58.513 --> 35:00.681
Can I have an hour?

35:21.912 --> 35:23.662
Bye, Daddy.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.571
Can you hear me?

36:00.909 --> 36:02.451
Sawyer?

36:18.802 --> 36:20.845
Wayne?

36:29.020 --> 36:31.146
I'm probably crazy...

36:33.024 --> 36:35.150
...and this doesn't matter...

36:38.071 --> 36:41.323
...but maybe you're in there, somehow.

36:42.242 --> 36:44.410
And you asked me a question.

36:45.161 --> 36:47.246
You asked me why I...

36:49.332 --> 36:51.417
Why I did it.

36:55.505 --> 36:58.048
It wasn't because
you drove my father away.

36:59.092 --> 37:01.427
Or the way you looked at me.

37:04.306 --> 37:06.640
Or because you beat her.

37:10.729 --> 37:13.731
It was because I hated
that you were part of me.

37:13.815 --> 37:16.942
That I would never be good.

37:17.027 --> 37:19.320
That I would never have anything good.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.489
And every time that I look at Sawyer,

37:22.616 --> 37:24.867
every time I feel something for him,

37:26.745 --> 37:28.829
I see you, Wayne.

37:29.664 --> 37:31.832
And it makes me sick.

37:37.130 --> 37:40.090
That's about the sweetest thing
I ever heard.

37:41.801 --> 37:43.510
Sawyer?

37:45.013 --> 37:47.348
Who the hell is Wayne?

37:57.984 --> 38:01.153
Am I in a bunk bed?

38:05.367 --> 38:07.660
Yeah, you're in a bunk bed.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.372
Are we saved?

38:16.086 --> 38:18.295
No, Sawyer.

38:18.380 --> 38:20.130
Not yet.

38:35.271 --> 38:36.605
Voilà.

38:38.191 --> 38:40.734
What are the odds?

38:40.860 --> 38:42.903
- The odds?
- Yeah.

38:43.571 --> 38:47.950
Here, hold this down on the table there,
nice and flat.

38:51.579 --> 38:56.083
I mean, think about it.
Somebody made this film.

38:58.211 --> 39:02.673
Someone else cut this piece out.

39:04.843 --> 39:09.388
We crash, two halves of the same plane
fall on different parts of the island.

39:09.472 --> 39:11.849
You're over there. I'm over here.

39:13.268 --> 39:17.062
And now here's the missing piece,
right back where it belongs.

39:19.441 --> 39:21.525
What are the odds?

39:23.278 --> 39:26.363
Don't mistake coincidence for fate.

39:42.047 --> 39:44.465
You've gotta be kidding me.

39:44.549 --> 39:46.842
Airlock's over this way.

39:48.511 --> 39:51.805
Come on, admit it. We've been rescued.

39:56.144 --> 39:58.270
You got it? Sorry.

39:59.105 --> 40:01.148
Watch yourself.

40:10.116 --> 40:12.201
Son of a bitch.

40:14.829 --> 40:16.789
Watch yourself, OK?

40:19.834 --> 40:21.710
- I got it.
- OK.

40:26.257 --> 40:28.467
Home, sweet home.

40:28.551 --> 40:30.052
Yeah.

40:30.678 --> 40:33.097
I really thought
you were yanking my chain.

40:34.974 --> 40:37.142
What do you keep smiling at?

40:37.227 --> 40:39.603
You need a haircut.

40:40.355 --> 40:42.272
Oh, really?

40:50.281 --> 40:52.699
Maybe you ought to take me back inside.

41:06.714 --> 41:08.757
You see that?

41:13.012 --> 41:17.432
You mean the big-ass horse standing
in the middle of the jungle? Then, yeah.

41:40.707 --> 41:42.916
You know that horse, Freckles?

41:46.754 --> 41:48.797
Yeah, I do.

42:01.102 --> 42:04.271
Tequila and tonic.
That's your drink, right?

42:06.024 --> 42:09.735
- Where's the tonic?
- We're running a little low on mixers.

42:16.284 --> 42:18.410
Sure you wanna waste that on me?

42:19.412 --> 42:21.496
I figured you could use a drink.

42:23.583 --> 42:25.626
I know I could.

42:27.337 --> 42:31.006
You gonna try to convince me that
everyone here doesn't hate me?

42:32.967 --> 42:37.512
Only if you're gonna try to convince me
every woman in the world's not crazy.

42:46.272 --> 42:51.485
When the alarm sounds, either you
or your partner must input the code.

42:52.403 --> 42:56.782
It is highly recommended that you and
your partner take alternating shifts.

42:56.866 --> 42:59.910
In this manner,
you will both stay as fresh and alert...

43:00.036 --> 43:02.579
...utmost importance
that when the alarm sounds,

43:02.664 --> 43:05.749
the code be entered correctly
and in a timely fashion.

43:05.833 --> 43:06.833
Here it comes.

43:06.960 --> 43:10.295
Do not attempt to use the computer
for anything else

43:10.380 --> 43:14.758
other than the entering of the code.
This is its only function.

43:14.842 --> 43:18.595
The isolation that attends the duties
associated with Station Three

43:18.680 --> 43:21.265
may tempt you
to try and utilize the computer

43:21.349 --> 43:25.394
for communication with the outside
world. This is strictly forbidden.

43:26.020 --> 43:28.438
Attempting to use
the computer in this manner

43:28.564 --> 43:32.025
will compromise
the integrity of the project and...

43:32.110 --> 43:34.778
worse, could lead to another incident.

43:35.947 --> 43:41.702
I repeat: do not use the computer for
anything other than entering the code.

43:43.579 --> 43:45.122
Congratulations.

43:45.206 --> 43:50.002
Until your replacements arrive, the
future of the project is in your hands.
