<c.speakerTop>[Naomi] And we'll hang
the welcome banner over there,

01:06.458 --> 01:08.333
<c.speakerTop>hand out jaquin masks
on the docks,

01:08.333 --> 01:10.583
<c.speakerTop>and serve jaquin-themed snacks
on the boardwalk.

01:10.583 --> 01:12.625
<c.speakerTop>Ooh, I know just
what to serve!

01:12.625 --> 01:14.250
<c.speakerTop>Anoki berry agua frescas?

01:14.250 --> 01:17.166
<c.speakerTop>Exactly! Great minds
think alike.

01:17.166 --> 01:18.958
<c.speakerTop>-Uh-huh.
-Now, we still have

01:18.958 --> 01:21.708
<c.speakerTop>to figure out where
to put the Golden Jaquin.

01:21.708 --> 01:23.208
<c.speakerTop>Golden Jaquin?

01:23.208 --> 01:25.458
<c.speakerTop>No one told me anything
about a Golden Jaquin!

01:25.458 --> 01:28.166
<c.speaker>It's one of the oldest statues
in the treasury!

01:28.166 --> 01:30.250
<c.speaker>I thought, as a part
of the Jaquin Festival,

01:30.250 --> 01:33.000
<c.speaker>we'd find a special place
in the kingdom to put it.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.333
<c.speaker>You know, as a thank you
to the jaquins.

01:35.333 --> 01:39.000
<c.speaker>Uh... Ooh, why don't we
put it over there

01:39.000 --> 01:41.458
<c.speaker>so it greets all visitors
to Avalor?

01:41.458 --> 01:45.083
<c.speaker>And that's why I made you
the festival planner!

01:45.083 --> 01:49.958
<c.speaker>Hey-hey! Action jaquins
comin' through!

01:49.958 --> 01:52.833
<c.speaker>Skylar, where did all
your anoki berries go?

01:52.833 --> 01:55.166
<c.speaker>Uh... some of them fell?

01:55.166 --> 01:56.583
<c.speaker>Yeah, into your mouth.

01:56.583 --> 01:59.375
<c.speaker>Thanks for bringing these
all the way from Vallestrella.

01:59.375 --> 02:03.333
<c.speaker>Hey, it's not every day
you guys throw a festival
in our honor!

02:03.333 --> 02:04.958
<c.speaker>It's the least we can do
to thank you

02:04.958 --> 02:06.458
<c.speaker>for everything
you've done for Avalor.

02:06.458 --> 02:08.625
<c.speaker>We couldn't have defeated
Shuriki without your help.

02:08.625 --> 02:10.958
<c.speaker>Thank goodness
she's gone for good

02:10.958 --> 02:13.166
<c.speaker>and won't be cooking up
any more trouble!

02:13.166 --> 02:15.291
<c.speaker>[ominous music]

02:15.291 --> 02:16.416
<c.speaker>[zap]

02:18.166 --> 02:20.458
<c.speaker>That potion smells horrible.

02:20.458 --> 02:21.500
<c.speaker>When will it be ready?

02:21.500 --> 02:24.291
<c.speaker>Once it smells disgusting.

02:24.291 --> 02:27.333
<c.speaker>Ugh, what smells
so disgusting?

02:27.333 --> 02:29.416
<c.speaker>A shapeshifting potion.

02:29.416 --> 02:32.875
<c.speaker>You'll drink it
and be transformed
into a total stranger.

02:32.875 --> 02:34.458
<c.speaker>And why would I do that?

02:34.458 --> 02:36.458
<c.speaker>So you can go to the palace

02:36.458 --> 02:40.458
<c.speaker>and pretend to be someone's
long-lost relative!

02:40.458 --> 02:43.416
<c.speaker>Try Armando.
He's an easy mark.

02:43.416 --> 02:44.583
<c.speaker>Once you're inside,

02:44.583 --> 02:46.583
<c.speaker>you'll find a way
into the treasury

02:46.583 --> 02:49.000
<c.speaker>and steal
Elena's mother's tiara!

02:49.000 --> 02:51.375
<c.speaker>The one
with the magical jewel!

02:51.375 --> 02:54.458
<c.speaker>Yes, child.
I'll use its magic

02:54.458 --> 02:56.375
<c.speaker>to make a new wand

02:56.375 --> 03:00.000
<c.speaker>and take over Avalor
once again, ha ha ha!

03:00.000 --> 03:02.458
<c.speaker>And make us <i>malvagos.  </i>
Don't forget that.

03:02.458 --> 03:03.750
<c.speaker>How could I?

03:03.750 --> 03:06.583
<c.speaker>You both constantly
remind me.

03:06.583 --> 03:10.333
<c.speaker>Now, if you don't mind,
I have a potion to finish.

03:10.333 --> 03:12.583
<c.speaker>Ach, Carla!

<c.speaker>Time to go

05:30.708 --> 05:34.250
<c.speaker>The name's Rita.

05:34.250 --> 05:37.625
<c.speaker>Naomi, I know you want
the festival to go well,

05:37.625 --> 05:39.958
<c.speaker>but you don't have to paint
the banner yourself!

05:39.958 --> 05:41.458
<c.speaker>-I don't mind!
-Ahem.

05:41.458 --> 05:44.125
<c.speaker>There's a visitor
for the chief of the castle.

05:44.125 --> 05:47.250
<c.speaker>-For me?
-Armando!

05:47.250 --> 05:48.625
<c.speaker>[frightened yell]

05:48.625 --> 05:49.625
<c.speaker>No!

05:49.625 --> 05:53.291
<c.speaker>Oh, I missed you
so much, <i>primo! </i>

05:53.291 --> 05:55.583
<c.speaker><i>Primo? </i>We're cousins?

05:55.583 --> 05:57.375
<c.speaker>You don't remember me?

05:57.375 --> 05:59.583
<c.speaker>I'm Rita Perez,
your grandfather's sister's

05:59.583 --> 06:01.958
<c.speaker>husband's uncle's
wife's son's daughter

06:01.958 --> 06:04.208
<c.speaker>on your mother's side,
which makes us--

06:04.208 --> 06:06.333
<c.speaker><i>Familia! </i>

06:07.625 --> 06:09.458
<c.speaker>Welcome to Avalor, Rita.

06:09.458 --> 06:11.291
<c.speaker>I'm Princess Elena.

06:11.291 --> 06:12.583

<c.speaker>I hope you'll stay here

06:15.708 --> 06:17.208
<c.speaker>while you visit
your cousin.

06:17.208 --> 06:19.708
<c.speaker>Oh, I wouldn't want
to impose.

06:19.708 --> 06:22.958
<c.speaker>Don't be silly!
<i>Familia </i>is always welcome.

06:22.958 --> 06:24.833
<c.speaker>I still can't believe
my big shot <i>primo </i>

06:24.833 --> 06:26.583
<c.speaker>lives in an actual palace!

06:26.583 --> 06:28.500
<c.speaker>Maybe you can
give me a tour?

06:28.500 --> 06:32.708
<c.speaker>-Sure, right after--
-Great! Show me everything.

06:32.708 --> 06:35.875
<c.speaker>Are you kids prepared
to be amazed?

06:35.875 --> 06:37.125
<c.speaker>-Yes, papa!
-Oh, yeah!

06:37.125 --> 06:38.166
<c.speaker>"Abstatutely"!

06:38.166 --> 06:39.583
<c.speaker>Are you prepared

06:39.583 --> 06:40.875
<c.speaker>to witness the greatness

06:40.875 --> 06:43.291
<c.speaker>of the guardians of Avalor?

06:43.291 --> 06:45.166
<c.speaker>-I am, Papa!
-I am!
-Me too!

06:45.166 --> 06:46.625
<c.speaker>Are you prepared--

06:46.625 --> 06:49.583
<c.speaker>To stop flapping your gums
and start flapping your wings?

06:49.583 --> 06:51.583
<c.speaker>'Cause we gotta practice
our festival flyover.

06:51.583 --> 06:53.708
<c.speaker>Oh, right.
Let's do this.

06:53.708 --> 06:55.500
<c.speaker>[cubs cheering]

06:55.500 --> 06:57.500
<c.speaker>Your kids
sure are excited!

06:57.500 --> 06:59.875
<c.speaker>They've been talking
about the flyover all week,

06:59.875 --> 07:01.208
<c.speaker>so we'd better be great!

07:03.416 --> 07:04.583
<c.speaker>Here they come!

07:04.583 --> 07:07.083
<c.speaker>[all] Whoo-hoo!
Whoa!

07:09.583 --> 07:12.250
<c.speaker>Oh! So, what'd you think?

07:12.250 --> 07:14.750
<c.speaker>That was it?

07:14.750 --> 07:17.583
<c.speaker>Uh, yes.
It's a flyover,

07:17.583 --> 07:20.708
<c.speaker>and we flew...
over.

07:20.708 --> 07:23.166
<c.speaker>Aw, we thought you were
gonna do more stuff.

07:23.166 --> 07:25.708
<c.speaker>-Like tricks.
-Yeah, like tricks.

07:25.708 --> 07:27.875
<c.speaker>Tricks? Yes.
Yes, well.

07:27.875 --> 07:30.625
<c.speaker>Actually, we were
just getting warmed up.

07:30.625 --> 07:31.708
<c.speaker>Uh, we were?

07:31.708 --> 07:32.708
<c.speaker>Oof!

07:32.708 --> 07:34.250
<c.speaker>So you're gonna do more?

07:34.250 --> 07:37.583
<c.speaker>Oh, yes, much, much,
<i>much </i>more!

07:37.583 --> 07:39.208
<c.speaker>Now, you kids fly along

07:39.208 --> 07:41.375
<c.speaker>while we practice
the rest of the routine,

07:41.375 --> 07:43.416
<c.speaker>and we'll show you
the whole thing later.

07:43.416 --> 07:45.583
<c.speaker>-Can't wait!
-See ya, Dad!

07:45.583 --> 07:48.833
<c.speaker>What you talkin' 'bout, Migs?
What routine?

07:48.833 --> 07:50.583
<c.speaker>The one we're about
to come up with!

07:50.583 --> 07:53.000
<c.speaker>We've got to make
the flyover more impressive!

07:53.000 --> 07:55.875
<c.speaker>Add some loop de loops,
rolls, spins!

07:55.875 --> 07:58.000
<c.speaker>I'm already
getting dizzy.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.708
<c.speaker>Mm-mm, I'm not flying under him
if he gets airsick.

08:00.708 --> 08:02.583
<c.speaker>Both of you,
pull it together.

08:02.583 --> 08:03.875
<c.speaker>This is important!

08:03.875 --> 08:06.625
<c.speaker>Oh! I think I have
an invention that might help.

08:07.875 --> 08:11.750
<c.speaker>This feels so right.

08:11.750 --> 08:14.083
<c.speaker>Uh, I'm not sure
you're allowed to sit--

08:14.083 --> 08:15.833
<c.speaker>Okay, what's next
on the tour?

08:15.833 --> 08:18.708
<c.speaker>How about...
the royal treasury.

08:18.708 --> 08:20.083
<c.speaker>Oh, I'm sorry, <i>prima. </i>

08:20.083 --> 08:23.708
<c.speaker>Elena only opens it up
when absolutely necessary.

08:23.708 --> 08:25.875
<c.speaker>But tomorrow they'll fetch
the jaquin statue

08:25.875 --> 08:28.333
<c.speaker>for the festival,
and you'll get to see that.

08:28.333 --> 08:30.125
<c.speaker>And who's doing
the fetching?

08:30.125 --> 08:32.708
<c.speaker>Naomi! She's
the festival planner.

08:32.708 --> 08:36.375
<c.speaker>Anyway, let me
show you your room.

08:36.375 --> 08:38.750
<c.speaker>Wait till you see
the view!

08:39.750 --> 08:40.708
<c.speaker>[gasps]

08:40.708 --> 08:42.958
<c.speaker>Uh, I've seen enough.

08:42.958 --> 08:45.458
<c.speaker>Thanks for the tour, <i>primo.  </i>
See you later!

08:45.458 --> 08:48.625
<c.speaker>Whew. Now all I have to do
is convince Elena

08:48.625 --> 08:51.875
<c.speaker>that Rita would make a better
festival planner than Naomi,

08:51.875 --> 08:54.291
<c.speaker>and the tiara
will be mine.

08:57.125 --> 08:59.625
<c.speaker>We would love your help
with the festival, Rita!

08:59.625 --> 09:02.333
<c.speaker>-Thanks for offering!
-There's a lot to do.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.833
<c.speaker>See, it's all
going to take place
at the port, and--

09:04.833 --> 09:08.125
<c.speaker>What a great idea!
Especially if you aren't
expecting many people.

09:08.125 --> 09:09.875
<c.speaker>We're expecting
the entire kingdom.

09:09.875 --> 09:13.000
<c.speaker>Huh. All crammed
onto that narrow boardwalk?

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
<c.speaker>Oh. I hadn't thought
about that.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.375
<c.speaker>You know, as I was riding
into the city,

09:17.375 --> 09:18.625
<c.speaker>I saw a large stadium.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.500
<c.speaker>I bet it could hold
a big crowd.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.375
<c.speaker>And it looks a lot nicer.

09:22.375 --> 09:24.583
<c.speaker>Oh, that's a good point.

09:24.583 --> 09:26.416
<c.speaker>You're the festival planner.

09:26.416 --> 09:27.500
<c.speaker>What do you think?

09:27.500 --> 09:29.125
<c.speaker>Yes, I'm sure
you know best.

09:29.125 --> 09:31.166
<c.speaker>I love your outfit,
by the way.

09:31.166 --> 09:32.875
<c.speaker>Uh, thanks.

09:32.875 --> 09:35.000
<c.speaker>Well, it'll be tough
to move everything,

09:35.000 --> 09:37.583
<c.speaker>but we have to be sure
there's room for everyone.

09:37.583 --> 09:39.083
<c.speaker>The stadium it is!

09:39.083 --> 09:40.750
<c.speaker>Thanks
for the great idea, Rita.

09:40.750 --> 09:42.458
<c.speaker>Oh, that's just
what I do.

09:42.458 --> 09:44.208
<c.speaker>Always helping.

09:45.583 --> 09:48.875
<c.speaker>I call these Sky Painters.

09:48.875 --> 09:50.375
<c.speaker>Sky Painters?

09:50.375 --> 09:51.625
<c.speaker>You just pull on this

09:51.625 --> 09:53.708
<c.speaker>to release a trail
of colorful smoke.

09:53.708 --> 09:57.333
<c.speaker>Wow! We can make
designs in the air?

09:57.333 --> 09:58.708
<c.speaker>All right!

09:58.708 --> 10:00.166
<c.speaker>[coughing]

10:00.166 --> 10:02.291
<c.speaker>No, you should wait
until you take off.

10:02.291 --> 10:04.333
<c.speaker>Excuse me
while I paint the sky!

10:04.333 --> 10:06.333
<c.speaker>[Isabel coughs]

10:06.333 --> 10:08.750
<c.speaker>[both cough]

10:10.416 --> 10:12.416
<c.speaker>This is just
what we need, Princess!

10:12.416 --> 10:13.708
<c.speaker>Luna, Skylar!

10:13.708 --> 10:16.708
<c.speaker>This'll work once you fly
exactly where I say

10:16.708 --> 10:18.750
<c.speaker>so we can make
the perfect smoke patterns.

10:18.750 --> 10:21.875
<c.speaker>Now, first we'll do
a barrel-roll braid,

10:21.875 --> 10:24.583
<c.speaker>then we'll fly
in a giant circle, then we'll--

10:24.583 --> 10:26.708
<c.speaker>Or we could just fly
circles around you!

10:26.708 --> 10:28.750
<c.speaker>-Stop it, you two!
-♪ Ring around the Migsy ♪

10:28.750 --> 10:30.208
<c.speaker>I mean it!
This is serious!

<c.speaker>That's it!
I'm not doing the flyover.

10:42.166 --> 10:45.166

having a little fun!

10:45.166 --> 10:47.875

<c.speaker>-Step one, redecorate.
-[ripping]

11:07.875 --> 11:10.750
<c.speaker>Everything's been moved
from the port to the stadium.

11:10.750 --> 11:12.250
<c.speaker>[gasps] What happened?!

11:12.250 --> 11:13.833
<c.speaker>I don't know!
I came in here

11:13.833 --> 11:16.000
<c.speaker>to work on the banner
and found it ripped!

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
<c.speaker>Oh, Naomi,
all of your hard work!

11:19.000 --> 11:21.458
<c.speaker>Not to worry!
I made a new one.

11:21.458 --> 11:22.750
<c.speaker>Oh, that was fast.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.291
<c.speaker>Really fast.

11:24.291 --> 11:26.833
<c.speaker>Thanks for fixing this
before it became a problem.

11:26.833 --> 11:28.083
<c.speaker>It's what I do!

11:28.083 --> 11:29.583
<c.speaker>By the way, nice outfit!

11:29.583 --> 11:31.583
<c.speaker>Huh! You and Naomi
could be twins!

11:31.583 --> 11:34.000
<c.speaker>Elena, can I talk
to you a minute?

11:34.000 --> 11:37.875
<c.speaker>And while you two chit-chat,
I'll go write up the music list.

11:37.875 --> 11:40.750
<c.speaker>The banner was fine
when I left here last night,

11:40.750 --> 11:43.416
<c.speaker>and Rita was the only one
here this morning.

11:43.416 --> 11:46.000
<c.speaker>It feels like she's trying
to make me look bad.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.708
<c.speaker>Naomi, ugh,
I don't think that's true.

11:48.708 --> 11:52.250
<c.speaker>Not only that,
it's really strange
that she's dressing like me.

11:52.250 --> 11:54.458
<c.speaker>She looks up to you.

11:54.458 --> 11:57.000
<c.speaker>That's why
she's working so hard.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.625
<c.speaker>If you say so, Elena.

11:59.625 --> 12:03.375
<c.speaker>Step two,
no more anokis.

12:03.375 --> 12:04.708
<c.speaker>Blech!

12:04.708 --> 12:06.875
<c.speaker>Nothing like
the taste of vinegar!

12:06.875 --> 12:08.000
<c.speaker>[chuckles]

12:08.000 --> 12:09.250
<c.speaker>[bell dings]

12:13.875 --> 12:17.625
<c.speaker>Step three,
<i>adios, </i>jaquin masks.

12:19.833 --> 12:22.625
<c.speaker>Operation Bye-Bye Naomi
complete.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.458
<c.speaker>[Elena] Good morning!

12:25.458 --> 12:27.708
<c.speaker>Is everyone ready
for the festival?

12:27.708 --> 12:29.458
<c.speaker>Everything
is A-okay!

12:29.458 --> 12:31.875
<c.speaker>Your dress is
absolutely gorgeous!

12:31.875 --> 12:33.000
<c.speaker>Thank you!

12:33.000 --> 12:36.708
<c.speaker>Your Highness,
the anoki berries went sour!

12:36.708 --> 12:38.250
<c.speaker>Wh-- That's impossible!

12:38.250 --> 12:40.458
<c.speaker>They were just picked
yesterday!

12:40.458 --> 12:42.125
<c.speaker>[gags]
I take that back.

12:42.125 --> 12:44.083
<c.speaker>It is possible.

12:44.083 --> 12:46.625
<c.speaker>We'll never get
more anoki berries in time.

12:46.625 --> 12:49.250
<c.speaker>They're really hard to find
outside Vallestrella.

12:49.250 --> 12:50.333
<c.speaker>[panting]

12:50.333 --> 12:51.875
<c.speaker>Give me some
good news, Armando.

12:51.875 --> 12:54.250
<c.speaker>Sorry, I only
have bad news.

12:54.250 --> 12:56.333
<c.speaker>The jaquin masks
never arrived!

12:56.333 --> 12:58.083
<c.speaker>But the festival's
in an hour!

12:58.083 --> 13:00.000
<c.speaker>An hour!
What are we gonna do?!

13:00.000 --> 13:04.125
<c.speaker>Oh, no! Things are just
completely falling apart!

13:04.125 --> 13:06.000
<c.speaker>It's okay.
We can fix this.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.708
<c.speaker>Uh, I'll see what other fruit
we have in the kitchen.

13:08.708 --> 13:11.000
<c.speaker>And I'll try to come up
with a backup plan.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.708
<c.speaker>Hmm...

13:12.708 --> 13:14.000
<c.speaker>Ooh!

13:14.000 --> 13:17.500
<c.speaker>What if,
instead of jaquin masks,

13:17.500 --> 13:19.625
<c.speaker>we had jaquin face painting?

13:19.625 --> 13:21.291
<c.speaker>Now, that's a great idea!

13:21.291 --> 13:23.583
<c.speaker>And instead of anoki berry
agua frescas,

13:23.583 --> 13:25.500
<c.speaker>we can made
jaquin-shaped cookies!

13:25.500 --> 13:26.958
<c.speaker>That's an even better idea!

13:26.958 --> 13:29.958
<c.speaker>Uh, hold on!
I just remembered

13:29.958 --> 13:31.833
<c.speaker>that on my way
to the palace,

13:31.833 --> 13:34.000
<c.speaker>I saw a big patch
of anoki bushes.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.166
<c.speaker>You did? Where?

13:35.166 --> 13:38.958
<c.speaker>At the... glen!
Near the waterfall!

13:38.958 --> 13:41.000
<c.speaker>Enough to make agua frescas
for the festival?

13:41.000 --> 13:42.083
<c.speaker>More than enough!

13:42.083 --> 13:43.583
<c.speaker>Oh, I can only imagine

13:43.583 --> 13:45.583
<c.speaker>how relieved
Princess Elena will be

13:45.583 --> 13:47.708
<c.speaker>when I return
with the anoki berries

13:47.708 --> 13:49.000
<c.speaker>and I save the festival!

13:49.000 --> 13:52.583
<c.speaker>Actually, why don't
I get them.

13:52.583 --> 13:54.958
<c.speaker>[door opens, closes]

13:54.958 --> 13:57.250
<c.speaker>What are you still doing
here, Migs?

13:57.250 --> 14:00.083
<c.speaker>We need to head
over to the festival
for the flyover.

14:00.083 --> 14:02.166
<c.speaker>I told you,
I'm not doing it.

14:02.166 --> 14:05.000
<c.speaker>Aw, why not? Your babies
were all excited about it.

14:05.000 --> 14:07.875
<c.speaker>Exactly! That's the problem!

14:07.875 --> 14:10.000
<c.speaker>Meet you
at the "fiesta-val"!

14:10.000 --> 14:12.875
<c.speaker>Can't wait to see
the super-cool flyover.

14:12.875 --> 14:16.208
<c.speaker>Those little jaquins
really look up to me.

14:16.208 --> 14:20.083
<c.speaker>They think I'm super cool,
and... oh.

14:20.083 --> 14:22.250
<c.speaker>I don't want
to let them down.

14:22.250 --> 14:26.000
<c.speaker>I can only think of one way
you can let them down.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.583
<c.speaker>If you don't show up.

14:28.583 --> 14:30.416
<c.speaker>So, what do you think?

14:37.708 --> 14:39.708
<c.speaker>I think you'd better
put this on me

14:39.708 --> 14:41.458
<c.speaker>so we can get
to the festival.

14:41.458 --> 14:43.125
<c.speaker>All right!
And after that,

14:43.125 --> 14:45.458
<c.speaker>we can practice that routine
you keep talking about!

14:45.458 --> 14:47.083
<c.speaker>-You mean it?
-Uh-huh!

14:47.083 --> 14:49.416
<c.speaker>We're gonna give
your little ones
a show to remember.

14:54.125 --> 14:55.875
<c.speaker>You know, I think
we should move

14:55.875 --> 14:57.708
<c.speaker>the jaquin statue
presentation...

14:57.708 --> 14:59.875
<c.speaker>To right after
the flyover?

14:59.875 --> 15:02.708
<c.speaker>Exactly. Great minds
think alike!

15:02.708 --> 15:06.000
<c.speaker>That's our thing!
Our great minds think alike!

15:06.000 --> 15:08.250
<c.speaker>Naomi! Are you okay?

15:08.250 --> 15:10.250
<c.speaker>Did you find
the anoki berries?

15:10.250 --> 15:12.625
<c.speaker>No! I did not find
the anoki berries

15:12.625 --> 15:15.875
<c.speaker>because there were
no anoki berries
growing in that spot!

15:15.875 --> 15:18.416
<c.speaker>That's okay, because Rita
had some great ideas

15:18.416 --> 15:21.875
<c.speaker>like jaquin face painting
and jaquin-shaped cookies.

15:21.875 --> 15:25.458
<c.speaker>[growls] Those are my ideas!
She stole them!

15:25.458 --> 15:28.291
<c.speaker>-Naomi!
-Don't you see
what's going on, Elena?

15:28.291 --> 15:30.000
<c.speaker>She sent me
on a wild goose chase

15:30.000 --> 15:31.166
<c.speaker>to get rid of me,

15:31.166 --> 15:32.083
<c.speaker>she stole my ideas,

15:32.083 --> 15:34.166
<c.speaker>she stole
my signature vest look,

15:34.166 --> 15:36.083
<c.speaker>and I am sure,
I am just positive

15:36.083 --> 15:38.625
<c.speaker>that she stole
those jaquin masks, too!

15:38.625 --> 15:41.500
<c.speaker>Who, me? You think
I took them?

15:41.500 --> 15:45.250
<c.speaker>I know you did,
and I'm going to prove it.

15:45.250 --> 15:47.125
<c.speaker>Naomi!

15:49.583 --> 15:51.625
<c.speaker>Those jaquin masks
are hidden somewhere in here,

15:51.625 --> 15:53.125
<c.speaker>I just know it!

15:53.125 --> 15:55.458
<c.speaker>Ah-ha! Huh?

15:55.458 --> 15:58.250
<c.speaker>They're gifts
for each of you,

15:58.250 --> 16:01.583
<c.speaker>to thank you for being
such great friends.

16:01.583 --> 16:02.958
<c.speaker>I still don't buy it.

16:02.958 --> 16:04.750
<c.speaker>[scoffs]
I know it's frustrating

16:04.750 --> 16:07.166
<c.speaker>that so much has gone wrong
with the festival,

16:07.166 --> 16:09.000
<c.speaker>but none of that
is Rita's fault!

16:09.000 --> 16:10.500
<c.speaker>She's done nothing
but help us.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.583
<c.speaker>-It's what I--
-Do. I know.

16:12.583 --> 16:14.958
<c.speaker>I can't believe
you're taking her side!

16:14.958 --> 16:17.208
<c.speaker>You're supposed to be
my best friend.

16:17.208 --> 16:20.583
<c.speaker>I am! And that's why
I'm worried about you.

16:20.583 --> 16:22.708
<c.speaker>I think you're under
too much pressure

16:22.708 --> 16:24.166
<c.speaker>with all of
the festival planning.

16:24.166 --> 16:25.500
<c.speaker>If that's how you feel,

16:25.500 --> 16:27.125
<c.speaker>maybe I should step down
from the job.

16:27.125 --> 16:29.500
<c.speaker>-Naomi, no!
-I'm clearly getting in the way,

16:29.500 --> 16:32.208
<c.speaker>and you obviously think Rita
has all the answers,

16:32.208 --> 16:34.291
<c.speaker>so I'll make things
easy on you and leave.

16:34.291 --> 16:36.875
<c.speaker>But that's not
what I want!

16:36.875 --> 16:38.125
<c.speaker>Please come back!

16:38.125 --> 16:40.166
<c.speaker>I'm going after her.

16:40.166 --> 16:41.708
<c.speaker>Oh, I wouldn't.

16:41.708 --> 16:44.125
<c.speaker>It looks like she needs
a little time to cool off.

16:44.125 --> 16:46.458
<c.speaker>[sighs]
You're probably right.

16:46.458 --> 16:51.166
<c.speaker>But, if you like,
I'm happy to step in
as festival planner--

16:51.166 --> 16:53.708
<c.speaker>until you two patch
things up, of course.

16:53.708 --> 16:56.166
<c.speaker>Oh, well, that would
be great!

16:56.166 --> 16:59.166
<c.speaker>You're a lifesaver.

16:59.166 --> 17:01.458
<c.speaker>It's what we do.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.833
<c.speaker>Mom? Dad?

17:05.833 --> 17:06.875
<c.speaker>Are you home?

17:06.875 --> 17:08.125
<c.speaker>Ugh, great.

17:08.125 --> 17:10.166
<c.speaker>They already left
for the festival.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.125
<c.speaker>[sighs]

17:16.125 --> 17:17.583
<c.speaker>Señorita Naomi!

17:17.583 --> 17:19.458
<c.speaker>I found this crate
addressed to you.

17:19.458 --> 17:21.250
<c.speaker>I'm not sure
how we missed it.

17:21.250 --> 17:25.000
<c.speaker>[gasps] Rita didn't take
the masks after all!

17:27.083 --> 17:30.083
<c.speaker>I can't believe Naomi
really isn't coming.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.416
<c.speaker>It's sad, I know,
but I'm here,

17:32.416 --> 17:34.708
<c.speaker>and I'm ready to do
whatever you need,

17:34.708 --> 17:36.458
<c.speaker>like fetch
the jaquin statue!

17:36.458 --> 17:39.416
<c.speaker>[gasps] Oh, right!
I totally forgot.

17:39.416 --> 17:42.291
<c.speaker>Do you mind going back
to the castle and getting it?

17:42.291 --> 17:45.250
<c.speaker>-It would be my pleasure.
-I'll get a guard to escort you.

17:45.250 --> 17:47.583
<c.speaker>-Oh, I don't need a--
-Lieutenant Villalobos!

17:47.583 --> 17:49.458
<c.speaker>Please take Rita
to the Royal Treasury

17:49.458 --> 17:51.875
<c.speaker>and help her bring the statue
to the festival.

17:51.875 --> 17:53.458
<c.speaker>Right this way,
señorita.

17:57.583 --> 18:00.250
<c.speaker>Elena! I really need
to talk to you.

18:00.250 --> 18:02.250
<c.speaker>I'm so glad you're here!

18:02.250 --> 18:04.250
<c.speaker>You are?
After everything I did?

18:04.250 --> 18:06.500
<c.speaker>Of course!
You're my best friend!

18:06.500 --> 18:09.166
<c.speaker>[sighs] I wasn't
acting like one.

18:09.166 --> 18:11.166
<c.speaker>We found the jaquin masks.

18:11.166 --> 18:12.625
<c.speaker>You were right.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.583
<c.speaker>I blamed Rita
without any proof,

18:14.583 --> 18:16.458
<c.speaker>and I shouldn't
have done that.

18:16.458 --> 18:18.958
<c.speaker>You were just worried
about the festival.

18:18.958 --> 18:21.333
<c.speaker>It was more than that.
I was jealous.

18:21.333 --> 18:25.250
<c.speaker>I was afraid Rita
was taking my place
as festival planner...

18:25.250 --> 18:27.250
<c.speaker>and as your best friend.

18:27.250 --> 18:30.250
<c.speaker>You never need
to worry about that.

18:30.250 --> 18:33.083
<c.speaker>Nobody could ever
take your place.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.333
<c.speaker>Thanks, Elena.

18:38.083 --> 18:39.166
<c.speaker>Where's Rita?

18:39.166 --> 18:40.875
<c.speaker>I should apologize
to her, too.

18:40.875 --> 18:42.291
<c.speaker>Oh, you just missed her.

18:42.291 --> 18:43.708
<c.speaker>She's on her way
to the palace

18:43.708 --> 18:46.083
<c.speaker>to get the jaquin statue
from the treasury.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.250
<c.speaker>I'll find her.

18:47.250 --> 18:49.458
<c.speaker>Come on, hurry up!

18:49.458 --> 18:52.750
<c.speaker>I mean, would you
like some help?

18:56.291 --> 18:57.708
<c.speaker>[under her breath]
There it is.

18:57.708 --> 19:00.875
<c.speaker>Stop! I have to disarm
the booby traps first.

19:00.875 --> 19:02.000
<c.speaker>[clanking]

19:02.000 --> 19:03.458
<c.speaker>Good thinking!

19:03.458 --> 19:05.708
<c.speaker>That is one sparkly rock!

19:05.708 --> 19:08.375
<c.speaker>Uh, señorita,
the statue's over there.

19:08.375 --> 19:09.708
<c.speaker>So it is!

19:09.708 --> 19:13.833
<c.speaker>Oh, but it looks too heavy
for one guard to carry.

19:13.833 --> 19:15.250
<c.speaker>I don't think so.

19:15.250 --> 19:16.958
<c.speaker>I'm sure so!

19:16.958 --> 19:19.333
<c.speaker>And Princess Elena
put me in charge,

19:19.333 --> 19:22.458
<c.speaker>so please go get
another guard. Now!

19:22.458 --> 19:23.458
<c.speaker>Right away!

19:24.833 --> 19:27.125
<c.speaker>That was too easy!

19:28.458 --> 19:32.500
<c.speaker>-Rita!
-Naomi! What are you doing here?

19:32.500 --> 19:35.416
<c.speaker>I just had to find you
and apologize for how
I was acting earlier.

19:35.416 --> 19:38.416
<c.speaker>Oh, that's not necessary.

19:38.416 --> 19:39.833
<c.speaker>Yes, it is.

19:39.833 --> 19:42.000
<c.speaker>I was accusing you
of terrible things, when--

19:42.000 --> 19:43.375
<c.speaker>Apology accepted!

19:43.375 --> 19:45.833
<c.speaker>Now, why don't I just meet
you at the festival?

19:45.833 --> 19:46.833
<c.speaker>I brought the backup!

19:46.833 --> 19:49.125
<c.speaker>Oh! Great.

19:49.125 --> 19:51.583
<c.speaker>Well, we better get
the statue to the festival.

19:51.583 --> 19:52.875
<c.speaker>[heaving]

19:54.750 --> 19:56.416
<c.speaker>Come on, Rita.

19:56.416 --> 20:00.166
<c.speaker>[through gritted teeth]
Coming, Naomi!

20:00.166 --> 20:02.333
<c.speaker>[groans]

20:02.333 --> 20:06.500
<c.speaker>Welcome to Avalor's
first Jaquin Festival!

20:06.500 --> 20:09.458
<c.speaker>Now, please turn your attention
to the skies above

20:09.458 --> 20:13.500
<c.speaker>for a very special
jaquin flyover!

20:13.500 --> 20:15.958
<c.speaker>[crowd cheering]

20:15.958 --> 20:18.000
<c.speaker>That's your cue, guys!

20:18.000 --> 20:19.708
<c.speaker>Look, my dad came!

20:19.708 --> 20:21.500
<c.speaker>He's sitting next
to Chief Zephyr!

20:21.500 --> 20:23.583
<c.speaker>[Luna] And Cruz
is here, too!

20:23.583 --> 20:25.583
<c.speaker>He's gonna be
the next jaquin chief!

20:25.583 --> 20:28.458
<c.speaker>And there are the
most important guests of honor,

20:28.458 --> 20:30.000
<c.speaker>my kids.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.750
<c.speaker>You're gonna
be great, Migs.

20:31.750 --> 20:33.125
<c.speaker>Wings up, <i>amigo! </i>

20:33.125 --> 20:35.333
<c.speaker>Okay. Ugh!

20:35.333 --> 20:36.708
<c.speaker>Wings up!

20:46.166 --> 20:47.625
<c.speaker>[Estrella]
Look at that, Zoom!

20:47.625 --> 20:52.708
<c.speaker>[jaquins laughing]

20:52.708 --> 20:54.500
<c.speaker>Whoo-hoo!

20:54.500 --> 20:57.208
<c.speaker>[Luna] Strike a pose!

20:57.208 --> 20:59.000
<c.speaker>[crowd cheering]

20:59.000 --> 21:01.458
<c.speaker>[Skylar] Ho ho ho!
Listen to that applause!

21:01.458 --> 21:02.750
<c.speaker>We're a hit, Migs!

21:02.750 --> 21:04.208
<c.speaker>We'll see.

21:05.875 --> 21:08.416
<c.speaker>Do it again, again!

21:08.416 --> 21:11.291
<c.speaker>When I grow up,
I wanna be just like you, Pops.

21:11.291 --> 21:13.416
<c.speaker>Oh, well.
[laughs]

21:13.416 --> 21:15.958
<c.speaker>Skylar and Luna
were pretty good, too.

21:15.958 --> 21:18.083
<c.speaker>[laughing]

21:18.083 --> 21:20.375
<c.speaker>I almost had the tiara,

21:20.375 --> 21:23.583
<c.speaker>but Elena's pesky friend--
Forget it.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.583
<c.speaker>I'll come up
with another plan.

21:25.583 --> 21:27.083
<c.speaker>You better hurry.

21:27.083 --> 21:29.291
<c.speaker>That shapeshifting potion
won't last forever.

21:29.291 --> 21:30.958
<c.speaker>-It won't?
-No.

21:30.958 --> 21:35.291
<c.speaker>So I want to see less sulking
and more scheming.

21:35.291 --> 21:38.583
<c.speaker>And now we would like
to honor our jaquin friends

21:38.583 --> 21:43.000
<c.speaker>by placing this Golden Jaquin
at the Port of Avalor.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.458
<c.speaker>[crowd cheering]

21:45.458 --> 21:49.416
<c.speaker>You sure know how
to put on a festival, Naomi.

21:49.416 --> 21:52.583
<c.speaker>Ooh, do we make
a great team or what!

21:52.583 --> 21:54.416
<c.speaker>We certainly do.

22:03.625 --> 22:06.458
<c.speaker>♪♪
