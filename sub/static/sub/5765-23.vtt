WEBVTT

00:18.510 --> 00:19.670
No hello?

00:19.720 --> 00:21.142
Hi.

00:29.830 --> 00:32.151
This is all just
an elaborate plan

00:32.200 --> 00:33.690
to get me alone,
isn't it?

00:33.730 --> 00:35.721
You found me out.
(wry chuckle)

00:36.870 --> 00:39.236
We're redoing
the floors.

00:39.270 --> 00:40.498
It's her.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.370
(thunder crashes)

01:07.730 --> 01:11.097
You'll have to turn off
cell phones and beepers.

01:11.130 --> 01:12.461
They expect me on call.

01:12.500 --> 01:14.263
We'll be 20 minutes
at the most.

01:18.710 --> 01:22.544
I can't believe
we're domg this.

01:22.580 --> 01:24.673
We could still turn back.

01:25.780 --> 01:27.441
I love you.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.511
We're redoing
the floors.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.719
Okay, I'll start.

01:41.760 --> 01:45.321
Due to agency-wide
budget cuts, the FBI has

01:45.370 --> 01:46.769
to be very selective

01:46.800 --> 01:48.529
with its Federal Witness
Protection monies.

01:48.570 --> 01:49.537
You have our proffer.

01:49.570 --> 01:53.301
Yes. Uh, very elegantly put.

01:53.340 --> 01:56.377
Unfortunately,
for my purposes,

01:56.410 --> 01:58.605
I'll need more
specificity.
Jack Arkin

01:58.650 --> 02:00.208
is part
of a joint task force

02:00.250 --> 02:02.548
with the Cook County
Sheriff's Office.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.546
He witnessed
and was pressured

02:04.590 --> 02:06.512
to participate
in illegal activities

02:06.560 --> 02:08.448
by other members
of his drug task force.

02:08.490 --> 02:10.549
Some of these activities
crossed state lines.

02:10.590 --> 02:12.251
He is willing
to help the FBI

02:12.300 --> 02:13.824
bring these corrupt cops
to justice...

02:13.860 --> 02:16.260
And save his own ass.

02:16.300 --> 02:18.188
Okay, maybe this was a mistake.

02:18.230 --> 02:19.788
All right,
all right.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.364
I understand

02:21.400 --> 02:23.436
Internal _Affairs
is Investigating
this task force.

02:23.470 --> 02:25.631
Why don't I just
let them do their work?

02:25.670 --> 02:27.638
Because the state's attorney
wants to be reelected.

02:27.680 --> 02:28.931
He's not gonna let
an investigation

02:28.980 --> 02:30.709
of his pet project
become an embarrassment.

02:30.750 --> 02:33.412
And what about the people
in this room who could benefit

02:33.450 --> 02:36.180
from such an embarrassment?

02:37.720 --> 02:39.187
I'll step out.

02:39.220 --> 02:42.451
No. The Arkins came to you;
it's your case.

02:44.460 --> 02:46.451
If you wouldn't mind,

02:46.500 --> 02:48.559
Mrs. Florrick, I think
it's better to avoid

02:48.600 --> 02:49.897
any appearance of a conflict.

02:55.540 --> 02:58.236
* Stand up!

02:58.270 --> 03:00.579
(music filtering
through earbuds)

03:00.610 --> 03:03.670
Hi.

03:03.710 --> 03:04.972
Hi.

03:05.010 --> 03:07.217
Giada. Alicia, right?

03:07.250 --> 03:08.877
Yes. Are you waiting
for someone?

03:08.920 --> 03:11.809
Yeah, Will.
They told me I could
wait down here.

03:11.850 --> 03:13.283
Oh. Uh, he'll be a while.

03:13.320 --> 03:14.981
Oh, that's okay.

03:15.020 --> 03:16.578
You're a friend from college,
right?

03:16.630 --> 03:17.858
Of Will's? Yes.

03:17.890 --> 03:19.448
DePaul, third year.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.469
Oh, you're in law school.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.968
He talks a lot about you;
almost makes me jealous.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.230
Don't be.

03:27.270 --> 03:28.999
J. K.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.359
Just kidding.

03:30.410 --> 03:32.799
Nice meeting you.

03:32.840 --> 03:35.331
* Stand up!

03:37.510 --> 03:38.772
* Stand up!

03:42.520 --> 03:44.385
* Stand up!

03:44.420 --> 03:45.648
* Whoo!

03:45.690 --> 03:46.884
ARKIN:
That's Hunter.

03:46.920 --> 03:49.354
He set up the drop house
for the stash.

03:49.390 --> 03:50.618
That's Brad.

03:50.660 --> 03:51.979
He stashes the meth.

03:52.030 --> 03:53.850
And, uh, Foley,
he moves the guns.

03:53.900 --> 03:54.924
You have proof?

04:01.570 --> 04:04.266
And where's this?

04:04.310 --> 04:05.265
(chuckles)

04:05.310 --> 04:07.005
Mr. Arkin,

04:07.040 --> 04:09.838
at some risk to his own life,
took photos

04:09.880 --> 04:11.871
of the task force's
drop house,

04:11.910 --> 04:14.344
and he will gladly share
the location

04:14.380 --> 04:16.712
upon receipt
of an immunity deal.

04:16.750 --> 04:19.958
You said there were
other corrupt cops
involved, Mr. Arkin.

04:19.990 --> 04:22.959
If you could study these photos
from these other busts.

04:25.460 --> 04:28.657
I don't know his name,
but... him,

04:28.700 --> 04:30.827
him...

04:33.770 --> 04:35.533
...and him.

04:37.770 --> 04:40.375
Him?
Yeah.

04:40.410 --> 04:42.742
Okay. I'll need a week
to brief my superiors,

04:42.780 --> 04:46.876
and then we can work
out the details.

05:01.130 --> 05:02.620
Hi.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.023
You're late.

05:04.070 --> 05:06.561
Yep.

05:06.600 --> 05:09.034
You're unhappy.
No.

05:09.070 --> 05:10.606
I'm drinking.

05:20.020 --> 05:24.081
Tony, you know this stuff
you're slipping me,

05:24.120 --> 05:25.985
crime reports and evidence?

05:26.020 --> 05:28.716
You ever worry
about getting caught?

05:28.760 --> 05:30.785
Getting caught?
Mm.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.081
Slipping you things?

05:33.000 --> 05:36.094
(chuckles) No!

05:36.130 --> 05:37.722
No. Why?

05:37.770 --> 05:40.136
Just part of doing business.

05:40.170 --> 05:44.459
Yeah. I mean, it's...
it's for a friend.

05:46.040 --> 05:48.031
Some things you do
for a friend.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.375
I feel like you're
having this conversation

05:53.420 --> 05:56.810
with yourself, and...
and I'm just listening in.

05:56.850 --> 06:01.082
No, I'm just... I'm just
figuring you out, that's all.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.486
(laughter)

06:03.530 --> 06:06.624
No, the only problem was
that Jackie got a piata.

06:06.660 --> 06:08.696
So we all went outside
in the middle of a rainstorm.

06:08.730 --> 06:09.958
And swinging bats
at a piata.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.422
Okay, where was I?

06:11.470 --> 06:12.732
Why haven't I heard
about this?

06:12.770 --> 06:14.169
Oh, and Grandma
was worried

06:14.200 --> 06:16.031
about us using
baseball bats.

06:16.070 --> 06:18.106
So she made everyone use
these little wooden spoons.

06:18.140 --> 06:20.028
PETER:
My wild and wacky family.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.775
You're stuck with us.

06:21.810 --> 06:24.779
For your first free meal,
you choose Obbie's?

06:24.810 --> 06:26.619
Ray.

06:26.650 --> 06:29.517
Ray Ernesto, hey!

06:29.550 --> 06:31.916
Honey, this is
Ray Ernesto,

06:31.950 --> 06:33.588
and he works for the
mayor's office.

06:33.620 --> 06:34.917
My children.

06:34.960 --> 06:36.928
Hi, kids. Just wanted to say
that Rich is a big fan,

06:36.960 --> 06:38.655
Pete, always has
been, and he'd love

06:38.690 --> 06:41.523
to show his support.
I'd love it,
but tell me

06:41.560 --> 06:42.925
you gotta leave that
dinosaur, Tolins & Brauer,

06:42.970 --> 06:44.926
come talk to my wife
about her firm.

06:44.970 --> 06:46.198
Oh, that's right,
you're at, um...

06:46.230 --> 06:47.788
Lockhart/Gardner.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.467
Yeah, We just might
look you over.

06:49.510 --> 06:50.807
Oh, Pete, uh...

06:50.840 --> 06:52.501
"Pe-Pete"?

06:54.880 --> 06:56.006
(whispering)

06:56.040 --> 06:57.473
(chuckling)

06:57.510 --> 06:58.704
Keep eating.
Yeah.

06:59.720 --> 07:00.971
"Pete"?

07:02.590 --> 07:03.614
So what'd he say?

07:03.650 --> 07:05.447
He said that, uh,

07:05.490 --> 07:07.458
Childs' days are numbered.

07:07.490 --> 07:08.855
(chuckles)

07:08.890 --> 07:10.619
Wow, you're big-time now.

07:10.660 --> 07:12.651
I'm just the flavor of the week.

07:12.700 --> 07:15.658
He'll be telling the same thing
to Childs tomorrow.

07:15.700 --> 07:17.497
Anything else
I can get you?

07:17.530 --> 07:20.465
Uh, no, we're
good. Thank you

07:20.500 --> 07:21.592
So do you like it?

07:21.640 --> 07:23.164
Do I like what?

07:23.210 --> 07:25.599
Stuff, politics.

07:25.640 --> 07:27.733
Um, I don't know.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.805
I like what
it can do.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.717
(phone rings)

07:32.750 --> 07:35.014
I'm sorry, it's work.

07:35.050 --> 07:36.517
Hello.

07:45.190 --> 07:46.919
No, thanks.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.496
I'm sorry...

07:48.530 --> 07:49.792
No dessert.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.488
(sighs)

07:54.540 --> 07:56.098
PETER:
What's wrong?

07:56.140 --> 07:59.132
It's my client.

07:59.170 --> 08:00.774
(tires squealing)

08:04.610 --> 08:08.171
DISPATCHER:
...00, officer down
at 373 Elmer Driver.

08:08.220 --> 08:10.017
MAN:
Hey, lady, stop!

08:10.050 --> 08:11.586
...00, officer down.

08:11.620 --> 08:13.156
All available units
reporting to...

08:16.160 --> 08:18.287
Hey, Kalinda,
you can't be here.

08:18.330 --> 08:19.820
What happened?
Out.

08:19.860 --> 08:21.748
Out, and I'll tell you.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.620
OFFICER:
Dispatch,
we got an officer down.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.298
Jack Arkin's down.
I repeat, Jack Arkin...

08:26.330 --> 08:29.663
(sirens wailing,
tires screeching)

08:29.710 --> 08:32.201
We raided this meth house, and
the shot came out of nowhere.

08:32.240 --> 08:34.174
Top of the stairs.

08:34.210 --> 08:35.939
Meth dealer named Gorman.

08:35.980 --> 08:37.777
We'd been following him
around for six months.

08:37.810 --> 08:40.210
Traded fire,
we took him down.

08:40.250 --> 08:42.047
Why was Jack through
the door alone?

08:42.080 --> 08:43.718
He wasn't through the door
alone. We were there.

08:43.750 --> 08:46.014
Just not fast enough, right?

08:46.050 --> 08:47.813
(indistinct radio chatter,
car doors closing)

08:48.820 --> 08:50.754
YOU excuse me for a second?

08:53.830 --> 08:56.663
(indistinct chatter)

09:01.100 --> 09:05.969
Captioning sponsored by
CBS TELEVISION

09:09.910 --> 09:11.878
I'm sorry, are you really
blaming me for this leak?

09:11.910 --> 09:15.641
Within 24 hours of our proffer,
our client was dead.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.045
Yes, and we're very saddened,

09:17.090 --> 09:19.786
but we can still get these
corrupt cops off the street.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.651
By giving you
the stash location?

09:21.690 --> 09:23.248
Unfortunately,
he never gave

09:23.290 --> 09:25.087
the location to us.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.655
Okay.

09:28.700 --> 09:31.669
Let's just chalk this up
as a bad first date.

09:36.770 --> 09:40.001
ALICIA:
I'm sorry to ask you this now,

09:40.040 --> 09:44.602
but you know our firm wants
to file suit against Cook County

09:44.650 --> 09:46.709
and the City of Chicago
for wrongful death?

09:46.750 --> 09:48.741
Yeah, they phoned.

09:51.790 --> 09:55.112
I just don't want anyone to
think I'm profiting from this.

09:55.160 --> 09:57.788
We worry Internal Affairs
will bury this

09:57.830 --> 09:59.798
'cause it's embarrassing
to the state's attorney.

09:59.830 --> 10:02.822
Give us a_chan_ce
to investigate it.

10:02.870 --> 10:04.189
By bringing a lawsuit?

10:04.230 --> 10:05.720
Yeah.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.739
So you think I should do this?

10:10.770 --> 10:15.935
I think bureaucracies
are often prompted

10:15.980 --> 10:19.746
to action by the
threat of money.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.915
KALINDA:
The task force was targeting
meth labs.

10:25.950 --> 10:28.714
Their story is that Arkin came
through the door first,

10:28.760 --> 10:31.320
and then was shot
by a meth dealer, Randy Gorman.

10:31.360 --> 10:34.056
Arkin ended up on his back here.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.819
Then the rest of the task force
returned fire, killing Gorman.

10:36.870 --> 10:38.326
But there's an
incon5istency.

10:38.370 --> 10:40.736
Lab found Jack's blood
mixed with his saliva

10:40.770 --> 10:42.328
exactly two feet
from the body here.

10:42.370 --> 10:43.803
DIANE:
Suggesting?

10:43.840 --> 10:46.308
That he fell face-first
onto the landing,

10:46.340 --> 10:48.171
then someone flipped him
over onto his back.

10:48.210 --> 10:50.906
It was staged.

10:50.950 --> 10:52.918
We'll need ballistics.
I'm on it.

10:55.180 --> 10:58.411
Okay, so our story is this:

10:58.450 --> 11:00.953
The task force discovered
Jack was gonna testify,

11:00.990 --> 11:02.355
killed Gorman,

11:02.390 --> 11:04.221
then used Gorman's gun
to kill Jack.

11:04.260 --> 11:07.093
Yeah.
DIANE: Let's finish this
off in depositions.

11:07.130 --> 11:10.065
Cook County won't want
this in the press.

11:10.100 --> 11:11.692
You're hot on this.

11:11.730 --> 11:13.368
I'm friends with
a lot of cops.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.891
The bad ones hurt
the good ones.

11:15.940 --> 11:18.329
So, this is a crusade?

11:18.370 --> 11:20.235
It's a job.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.271
And a job I'll do well.

11:25.850 --> 11:27.818
Notice I'm here
as an inVIted guest

11:27.850 --> 11:29.374
now that I'm_a client
of your firm.

11:29.420 --> 11:30.717
Yes.

11:30.750 --> 11:32.411
Welcome.

11:32.450 --> 11:34.008
Do you mind if I'm blunt,
Mrs. Florrick?

11:34.060 --> 11:35.482
Always a pleasure.

11:35.520 --> 11:38.819
I brought my business here.
I didn't have to.

11:38.860 --> 11:41.852
Do you mind if I'm
blunt, Mr. Gold?

11:41.900 --> 11:44.425
You brought your business here
because we're a good firm.

11:44.470 --> 11:47.030
And let's both agree
on one thing right now--

11:47.070 --> 11:49.903
there's a statute of limitations
on playing that card.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.201
Fair enough.

11:54.540 --> 11:56.906
This is Mimi Collins,

11:56.950 --> 11:59.817
a 24-year-old art student
at Whitley.

11:59.850 --> 12:02.273
Two years ago, she was raped
and brutally beaten

12:02.320 --> 12:04.743
by her ex-boyfriend,
a Michael Placedo.

12:04.790 --> 12:06.143
Well, if this is
a criminal matter,

12:06.190 --> 12:07.851
Mr. Gold, you can
take it upstairs.

12:07.890 --> 12:10.450
No. It's more of an allegory.

12:10.490 --> 12:13.152
Placedo was sentenced
to 20 years in prison

12:13.200 --> 12:15.498
by the state's attorney
at the time-- your husband.

12:15.530 --> 12:17.760
Mimi Collins went back
to college,

12:17.800 --> 12:19.893
a happy, healthy coed
with nothing to fear.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.965
Somehow, I feel this
will end badly.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.308
Mm-hmm.

12:23.340 --> 12:25.535
Glenn Childs,
in a general review

12:25.570 --> 12:28.539
of your husband's cases,
argued that Placedo be released

12:28.580 --> 12:29.842
with time served.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.541
That is
Mimi Collins' body--

12:31.580 --> 12:34.140
found two weeks ago
in a Chicago landfill.

12:34.180 --> 12:36.478
Looks like your first
ad campaign.
(chuckles)

12:36.520 --> 12:39.239
It would be...
if it weren't for the fact

12:39.290 --> 12:42.088
that Peter has decided
to wait four years to run.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.790
(chuckles)
Really?

12:45.830 --> 12:48.799
Mm-hmm. He said that at dinner
with you and the kids,

12:48.830 --> 12:52.789
he was_ worried about the
"seductive allure of power."

12:52.840 --> 12:54.990
Mr. Gold,

12:55.040 --> 12:58.931
who does the "seductive allure
of power" sound like to you?

12:58.970 --> 13:00.301
That's right.

13:00.340 --> 13:01.329
The good pastor, Isaiah.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.348
I need you to talk to him.

13:03.380 --> 13:06.144
He thinks he's trying
to restore your marriage.

13:06.180 --> 13:08.148
Tell him
you don't need that.

13:08.180 --> 13:10.819
Always good to see
you, Mr. Gold.

13:10.850 --> 13:12.852
Peter can't win without you.

13:12.890 --> 13:14.949
You know that.

13:14.990 --> 13:18.357
Peter only wins with your Good
Housekeeping seal of approval.

13:18.390 --> 13:20.824
Voters need to see you together

13:20.860 --> 13:22.396
up on that stage holding hands.

13:22.430 --> 13:25.024
Good-bye, Mr. Gold.

13:25.070 --> 13:26.196
(gunshots, beeping)

13:26.230 --> 13:29.438
(whirring, gunshots)

13:31.140 --> 13:34.371
Mr. Gorman got off
three rapid shots

13:34.410 --> 13:37.971
on the task force lead man,
your client, Mr. Arkin.

13:38.010 --> 13:42.413
All hit their target--
center, two high, one low.

13:42.450 --> 13:44.918
And this matches
the crime scene?

13:44.950 --> 13:47.418
No. My stairwell's
two steps taller.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.189
I've adjusted
by lowering the C-stand.

13:49.220 --> 13:53.429
Now, Mr. Arkin fell as he
was firing here on the landing,

13:53.460 --> 13:55.894
while another member
of the task force

13:55.930 --> 13:58.262
rushed in and fired
three shots from here.

13:58.300 --> 14:00.291
(gunshots)

14:02.140 --> 14:04.267
You all right?
Yes.

14:04.310 --> 14:07.131
What does it say about me
that I find this exhilarating?

14:07.180 --> 14:09.000
You're human.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.405
And are we saying
that the task force

14:10.450 --> 14:13.010
then planted a drop gun
on Mr. Gorman,

14:13.050 --> 14:15.439
or, uh... or
was it his?

14:15.480 --> 14:18.278
It was his.

14:18.320 --> 14:20.982
Well, so how did this...

14:21.020 --> 14:23.250
I mean, are you saying...

14:25.030 --> 14:26.998
You're saying it happened
the way the police said?

14:27.030 --> 14:28.156
Yes.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.293
It wasn't staged?

14:30.330 --> 14:31.490
That's correct.

14:31.530 --> 14:32.895
And the...

14:32.940 --> 14:34.965
and the blood and
saliva stain?

14:35.000 --> 14:37.434
You don't think Mr. Arkin was
flipped over onto his back?

14:37.470 --> 14:40.303
No. My guess is that,
in the extremity of the moment,

14:40.340 --> 14:41.898
one of Mr. Arkin's partners

14:41.940 --> 14:43.476
turned him on his back
to check his vitals,

14:43.510 --> 14:45.501
and they failed to report this
during the investigation.

14:45.550 --> 14:49.042
You seem to accord the police
a great deal of honesty.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.342
I do.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.515
And you brought me
out here to, what?

14:55.560 --> 14:59.121
Your firm asked me
to examine the eVIdence.

14:59.160 --> 15:01.253
Well, we've asked you that
before, and you just said no.

15:01.300 --> 15:04.599
That's true.

15:04.630 --> 15:07.599
It's because
of my feelings for you

15:07.640 --> 15:10.006
that I've shown you this.

15:10.040 --> 15:12.429
I won't bill you for the effort.

15:13.510 --> 15:15.307
Your feelings for me?

15:17.550 --> 15:20.417
I was approached by
the state's attorney's office.

15:23.250 --> 15:25.218
To argue against our lawsuit?

15:25.250 --> 15:26.581
Yes.

15:26.620 --> 15:28.281
I declined.

15:28.320 --> 15:31.221
I think you should do
what you want, Kurt.

15:31.260 --> 15:34.149
I think you should testify for
the state's attorney's office.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.350
I wouldn't hesitate
to argue against you.

15:36.400 --> 15:39.267
(phone ringing)

15:41.170 --> 15:42.535
Let me think about it.

15:42.570 --> 15:45.266
I'll go get my purse.

15:48.140 --> 15:49.368
McVEIGH:
Yo...

15:49.410 --> 15:51.401
(camera shutter clicking)

15:55.480 --> 15:58.540
(camera shutter clicking)

15:59.550 --> 16:01.518
WILL:
So, here we are.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.380
Dinner.
And I'm treating.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.557
Damn right, you are.
(laughs)

16:06.560 --> 16:08.494
I ran into Alicia Florrick.

16:09.530 --> 16:11.225
Uh-huh. Where?

16:11.270 --> 16:12.521
At the office. She seems nice.

16:12.570 --> 16:15.198
Yes, and a very talented lawyer.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.366
I'm sure.

16:16.400 --> 16:17.537
I felt like I was intruding.

16:17.570 --> 16:19.606
You felt like
you were intruding?

16:19.640 --> 16:21.198
I don't understand that.

16:21.240 --> 16:23.401
I felt like
I was getting checked out

16:23.450 --> 16:25.645
by someone who had skin
in the game.

16:29.750 --> 16:31.286
WAITER:
Seorita Cabrini.
Mmm.

16:31.320 --> 16:34.517
(speaking Spanish)

16:36.720 --> 16:40.190
(continuing in Spanish)

16:50.570 --> 16:52.299
He likes you.

16:52.340 --> 16:53.307
I'm so glad.

16:53.340 --> 16:54.500
You want me to translate?

16:54.540 --> 16:56.201
I understood every word.

16:57.310 --> 16:59.699
(snickers) Oh.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.369
So, do you come here a lot?

17:02.420 --> 17:03.580
My dad does.

17:03.620 --> 17:06.316
Your dad?
Who-who's your dad?

17:06.350 --> 17:09.387
If I tell you, you, uh,
promise not to freak out?

17:09.420 --> 17:11.456
Okay, not only do you
have to tell me now,

17:11.490 --> 17:12.582
but nothing could top
that introduction.

17:12.630 --> 17:13.756
Ernesto Cabrini.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.654
I don't know who that...

17:15.700 --> 17:17.463
Wait, I do know who that is.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.593
He's the fourth richest man
in Europe, right?

17:19.630 --> 17:21.268
Third, not that we're counting.

17:21.300 --> 17:22.562
So, men freak out about that?

17:22.600 --> 17:24.431
Only the ones
who are uncomfortable

17:24.470 --> 17:25.767
with their own masculinity.
Yeah.

17:25.810 --> 17:27.801
Hmm.

17:27.840 --> 17:29.671
WAITER:
Si, seor.

17:29.710 --> 17:32.599
What's your most expensive
bottle of wine?

17:32.650 --> 17:34.277
(laughing)

17:35.680 --> 17:37.386
DIANE:
So, there's no pressure in this.

17:37.420 --> 17:38.819
It's just a deposition.

17:38.850 --> 17:41.250
They're polite
and uncomplicated.

17:41.290 --> 17:43.758
They're just going to want
basic information.

17:43.790 --> 17:45.587
No one's trying
to score points.

17:45.630 --> 17:47.427
TRISH:
Thank you.

17:53.300 --> 17:54.528
(indistinct
conversation)

17:54.570 --> 17:56.299
CARY: That's good.
All right, good.

17:57.440 --> 17:58.634
Cary, everything
all right?

17:58.670 --> 18:00.274
Alicia. Hi.
How are you?

18:00.310 --> 18:01.709
Um... I'm fine.

18:01.740 --> 18:03.378
How are you?

18:03.410 --> 18:04.672
I'm good, too.

18:04.710 --> 18:05.847
Are you...

18:05.880 --> 18:07.768
Do you have a meeting with Will?

18:07.820 --> 18:08.844
No.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.518
Did you talk
to reception?

18:10.550 --> 18:11.744
No. I'm here for you.

18:11.790 --> 18:12.882
For me?

18:12.920 --> 18:14.649
Yes, the deposition.

18:14.690 --> 18:16.419
I'm working with
Glenn Childs now.

18:35.610 --> 18:37.202
Hi.

18:41.450 --> 18:44.487
How much money did your
husband make last year?

18:44.520 --> 18:46.841
Uh... last year?

18:46.890 --> 18:49.154
Uh, I don't know.

18:49.190 --> 18:51.886
My guess would be $55,000.

18:51.930 --> 18:53.921
And is it true _
that you took a vacation

18:53.960 --> 18:55.848
in Antigua last February?

18:55.900 --> 18:57.458
Yes.

18:57.500 --> 18:58.762
Do you remember
how much it cost?

18:58.800 --> 19:02.691
No.
$8,545 and change.

19:02.740 --> 19:04.799
That, ma'am, is over 15%

19:04.840 --> 19:06.603
of your husband's
yearly salary.

19:06.640 --> 19:07.868
I work, too.

19:09.740 --> 19:11.549
Yeah, part-time
as a nurse.

19:11.580 --> 19:13.571
That's an additional
23 grand a year.

19:13.620 --> 19:14.712
ALICIA: _
Just to save you time,

19:14.750 --> 19:16.672
Cary, we would stipulate

19:16.720 --> 19:18.711
_ to Mr. Arkin's involvement
in the task force's corruption.

19:18.750 --> 19:19.819
Yes.

19:19.850 --> 19:21.852
Thank you, Mrs. Florrick.

19:21.890 --> 19:24.188
I know that you would stipulate,
but I'm looking to itemize.

19:24.230 --> 19:27.256
Now, let's turn to your
domestic dispute charges

19:27.300 --> 19:29.450
against your husband.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.764
WILL:
Cute of the state's attorney.

19:31.800 --> 19:34.598
Shows some unexpected wit.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.596
Cary's a good lavwer.

19:36.640 --> 19:38.733
WILL:
You think we made
the wrong decision?

19:38.770 --> 19:41.568
Not necessarily.

19:41.610 --> 19:44.579
Let's see how well
he does against us.

19:44.610 --> 19:46.271
What's Cary
doing here?

19:46.310 --> 19:47.971
Working for the opposition.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.840
(chuckles) Smart.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.347
He's drawing blood, too.

19:52.350 --> 19:53.749
Look, I have some thoughts

19:53.790 --> 19:55.280
about finding this secret stash.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.719
Good. That could help us
with a settlement.

19:56.760 --> 19:57.784
Keep us informed.

20:01.630 --> 20:04.292
JACKIE:
Mr. Daley called.

20:04.330 --> 20:05.888
Said he wanted
to call Peter before,

20:05.930 --> 20:07.898
but he was too busy.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.261
I knew exactly what he...

20:13.810 --> 20:15.630
Would you excuse me a second?

20:15.680 --> 20:17.568
Looking for a Miss...

20:21.650 --> 20:24.517
Mr., uh... what was it again?

20:24.550 --> 20:26.586
Goldman?
Gold.

20:26.620 --> 20:28.554
Mrs. Florrick, hello.

20:28.590 --> 20:30.956
I thought you might be able to
help me with a little problem.

20:32.390 --> 20:34.255
Well, this isn't really
the place.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.598
Yes. Unfortunately, this
is a time-sensitive matter

20:36.630 --> 20:37.824
regarding your son.

20:54.350 --> 20:55.908
Peter is questioning whether

20:55.950 --> 20:57.542
to wait four years
before running.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.387
No, he's not.

20:59.420 --> 21:00.956
I'm sorry-- he is.

21:00.990 --> 21:02.855
And if we don't
file by the end

21:02.890 --> 21:04.858
of the week, we'll be forced
to wait four years.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.653
You're not lying?

21:08.800 --> 21:10.620
(repressed chuckle)
No.

21:10.670 --> 21:14.766
Sorry-- I wish I were.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.667
Pastor Isaiah talked to him.

21:17.710 --> 21:21.009
Who introduced him
to this pastor?

21:21.040 --> 21:23.008
I did, but not with
that intention.

21:23.040 --> 21:26.908
Mr. Gold, there is one thing
you need to know about my son.

21:26.950 --> 21:28.838
He is easily moved.

21:28.880 --> 21:32.418
You need to prescreen
the people who see him.

21:32.450 --> 21:35.419
And I will talk
to this man.

21:35.460 --> 21:39.920
Plan on making the announcement
by the end of the week.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.928
Thank you.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.793
Are you good, Mr. Gold?

21:45.830 --> 21:47.934
Am I good?

21:47.970 --> 21:49.938
Uh, I'm the best, ma'am.

21:49.970 --> 21:52.336
I will need you to be.

21:52.370 --> 21:54.838
(elegant music playing,
guests chatting)

21:57.910 --> 21:59.878
Shalom.

21:59.910 --> 22:00.945
Objection.

22:00.980 --> 22:02.049
Plaintiff's couns_el _
has an ongomg relationship

22:02.080 --> 22:03.889
with the expert witness.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.649
That seems more like a reason

22:05.690 --> 22:07.043
you shouldn't hire him

22:07.090 --> 22:08.648
than I shouldn't question him.

22:08.690 --> 22:11.523
I'm preserving
my objection for trial.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.761
Mr. McVeigh,

22:17.800 --> 22:19.893
on Tuesday last, did you
conduct an experiment

22:19.930 --> 22:22.660
duplicating the April 16th
officer shooting?

22:22.700 --> 22:24.133
I did.

22:24.170 --> 22:26.638
And this experiment was
conducted at your farm?

22:26.670 --> 22:27.671
It was.

22:27.710 --> 22:28.870
In your barn?

22:28.910 --> 22:30.673
Yes.
And this experiment led to

22:30.710 --> 22:33.679
your conclusion that the police
investigation was accurate?

22:33.720 --> 22:35.142
That's correct.

22:35.180 --> 22:37.546
Are you familiar
with the FBI standards

22:37.590 --> 22:38.989
for ballistic investigation?

22:40.050 --> 22:41.881
Iam.

22:41.920 --> 22:45.048
Was this investigation
in your barn

22:45.090 --> 22:46.682
in accordance
with those standards?

22:46.730 --> 22:49.028
In most respects.

22:49.060 --> 22:50.095
So, in some respects,

22:50.130 --> 22:51.165
it wasn't?

22:51.200 --> 22:52.827
That would follow.

22:52.870 --> 22:54.565
So that would be a yes?

22:54.600 --> 22:55.965
You are correct.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.809
The assailant's firearm
was lowered through the use

22:57.840 --> 22:59.068
of a C-stand?

22:59.110 --> 23:00.702
Yes.

23:00.740 --> 23:02.173
And the FBI standards

23:02.210 --> 23:04.007
caution that a C-stand

23:04.050 --> 23:06.041
is not a steady base
for a firearm?

23:06.080 --> 23:08.674
I believe that's correct.

23:08.720 --> 23:09.812
You believe?

23:09.850 --> 23:12.717
Yes, I believe.

23:12.750 --> 23:13.717
Well, then

23:13.760 --> 23:14.852
let's move on.

23:14.890 --> 23:16.653
In what other ways
do your home-spun

23:16.690 --> 23:19.022
investigative methods
clash with FBI standards?

23:23.900 --> 23:27.097
Do you need a minute,
Mr. McVeigh?

23:42.220 --> 23:44.916
TRISH:
I'm sorry.

23:44.950 --> 23:47.885
What are you looking for?

23:47.920 --> 23:50.821
These cell phone photos
leave a date and time.

23:54.830 --> 23:56.024
There.

23:56.060 --> 23:58.096
Saturday, March 13.

23:58.130 --> 24:00.166
How does that help you?

24:00.200 --> 24:03.033
Do you have
your credit card bills?

24:30.160 --> 24:33.561
*

24:48.050 --> 24:50.075
(dialing)

24:50.120 --> 24:51.280
(phone line ringing)

24:51.320 --> 24:53.288
KALIN DA:
Hey, so let's say

24:53.320 --> 24:56.517
I need to get into
a storage locker.

24:57.960 --> 25:00.554
See how much fun
it is being a Fed.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.591
24-hour court orders.

25:02.630 --> 25:04.621
Thank you.
Thanks.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.175
Here we go.

25:19.010 --> 25:20.671
Who you calling?

25:20.720 --> 25:23.245
Lockhart/Gardner.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.115
Something
on your mind?

25:29.160 --> 25:32.982
Let me see your phone.

25:33.030 --> 25:35.157
Why?

25:35.200 --> 25:37.998
I want to see_
who you're phoning.

25:38.030 --> 25:38.997
No.

25:39.030 --> 25:40.588
Why?

25:40.640 --> 25:42.528
Because I don't like
to be questioned.

25:48.310 --> 25:51.006
Mr. Arkin said there were
three other corrupt cops,

25:51.050 --> 25:54.178
so we immediately
put them under surveillance.

25:54.220 --> 25:57.314
This is you with
a Detective Anthony Burton

25:57.350 --> 25:59.614
two hours after our proffer,

25:59.650 --> 26:02.187
one hour before
Mr. Arkin was murdered.

26:05.360 --> 26:08.158
And here you are...

26:08.200 --> 26:10.122
ten minutes later in his car.

26:10.160 --> 26:12.958
So?

26:13.000 --> 26:15.764
So, Kalinda...

26:15.800 --> 26:19.258
there were only five of us
in that room for that proffer,

26:19.310 --> 26:23.030
and one of us leaked.

26:23.080 --> 26:25.344
Oh, so that's why

26:25.380 --> 26:28.645
these photos are
so important.

26:28.680 --> 26:31.217
This one of me
in the car.

26:31.250 --> 26:34.754
'Cause it shows
me... leaking.

26:34.790 --> 26:38.021
It shows you
in a compromised position.

26:38.060 --> 26:40.051
With a man.

26:40.090 --> 26:42.149
With a corrupt cop.

26:42.200 --> 26:45.067
And yet I phoned you

26:45.100 --> 26:47.318
to tell you about
the stash, didn't I?

26:47.370 --> 26:50.089
Which I wouldn't do
if I were compromised.

26:52.140 --> 26:53.607
True.

26:56.410 --> 26:58.708
I guess I could
just be confused.

27:07.120 --> 27:09.111
Good job, Kalinda.
Anything you can find

27:09.160 --> 27:11.219
to tie it to the task force
would help.

27:11.260 --> 27:12.750
Are you all right?

27:12.790 --> 27:14.826
You sound like_
you've been running.

27:14.860 --> 27:16.350
Okay.

27:16.400 --> 27:17.697
(quiet chatter)

27:28.940 --> 27:30.805
Something special?

27:30.850 --> 27:32.670
Just an $8,000 bottle of wine.

27:32.710 --> 27:34.268
A what?

27:34.320 --> 27:36.914
An $8,000 bottle of wine.

27:36.950 --> 27:40.886
So you're a kept man
these days, eh?

27:40.920 --> 27:42.751
I'm working on it.

27:44.730 --> 27:45.879
ALICIA:
You just said the opposite.

27:45.930 --> 27:47.283
No, I did not, ma'am.

27:47.330 --> 27:48.820
Then I don't understand.

27:48.860 --> 27:50.725
Well, I can't help
you with that.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.829
Look, we found
your stash location.

27:52.870 --> 27:54.269
You saw the police
investigative report.

27:54.300 --> 27:56.393
You saw the crime scene photos.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.362
So how did
Mr. Arkin's saliva end up

27:58.410 --> 28:00.401
on the landing two feet away
from his body?

28:00.440 --> 28:03.273
Why don't we take a break.
No, I think we're fine.

28:03.310 --> 28:04.743
Do you have an answer,
Mr. Hunter?

28:04.780 --> 28:06.270
You say you didn't
touch the body.

28:06.310 --> 28:08.369
So how did he end up
on his back?

28:08.420 --> 28:10.240
I want to confer
With counsel.

28:10.280 --> 28:11.747
ALICIA:
If that'll help you
get to the truth,

28:11.790 --> 28:12.848
sure.

28:12.890 --> 28:14.289
(whispering)

28:16.320 --> 28:19.027
Okay, no problem.

28:19.060 --> 28:22.951
Mr. Hunter would like
to adjust his testimony.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.423
Adjust?

28:25.470 --> 28:26.892
Let's adjust.

28:28.940 --> 28:31.363
I did move Jack Arkin's body.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.435
And why did you do that, sir?

28:33.470 --> 28:37.406
Jack was shot
and fell face forward.

28:37.440 --> 28:40.500
I, then, after firing upon
and killing Mr. Gorman,

28:40.550 --> 28:43.314
proceeded to turn Jack over
onto his back

28:43.350 --> 28:44.840
because he was wearing a wire,

28:44.890 --> 28:48.280
trying to nail us.

28:48.320 --> 28:49.457
Where is this wire?

28:49.490 --> 28:51.048
We gave it to Internal Affairs.

28:51.090 --> 28:52.455
This wire will be
supplied to you

28:52.490 --> 28:54.219
at the end of
the business day today.

28:54.260 --> 28:56.023
And guess what, lady?

28:56.060 --> 28:59.325
That wire that was
supposed to catch us--

28:59.370 --> 29:01.998
it shows this thing went down
exactly the way we said.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.361
So I'll be waiting
for your apology.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.401
You know what I would do
if I were you, AilCla?

29:08.110 --> 29:10.738
I'd prepare
for a season of losing.

29:19.820 --> 29:21.412
(three gunshots over recorder)

29:21.460 --> 29:24.224
(men shouting)

29:24.260 --> 29:27.320
(three gunshots)

29:27.360 --> 29:29.225
(shouting continues)

29:29.260 --> 29:31.069
(recorder clicks off)

29:31.100 --> 29:32.863
So they're saying this supports
their version of events.

29:32.900 --> 29:34.834
I hate to say it,
but I think it does.

29:34.870 --> 29:37.498
No, doesn't matter
if it supports it.

29:37.540 --> 29:39.167
What do you mean?

29:39.210 --> 29:41.371
Look at the incident report.

29:41.410 --> 29:43.878
Gorman was lying in wait,
gun in hands.

29:43.910 --> 29:45.798
And within seconds of Arkin
coming through the door,

29:45.850 --> 29:46.874
Gorman was firing.

29:46.910 --> 29:48.309
So it was a setup?

29:48.350 --> 29:49.544
Well, the task force knew

29:49.580 --> 29:51.081
Arkin was the first one
through the door.

29:51.120 --> 29:52.348
They didn't need
to kill Arkin.

29:52.390 --> 29:54.153
They just needed
Gorman to do it.

29:56.320 --> 29:58.550
Okay, wrongful death
is wrongful death.

29:58.590 --> 30:00.285
So let's look at Gorman.

30:00.330 --> 30:02.298
Did someone contact him?
Check phone records--

30:02.330 --> 30:03.922
any acquaintance
in common with Hunter.

30:05.870 --> 30:07.519
Please forgive the lateness,
people.

30:07.570 --> 30:09.538
We'll get started.

30:09.570 --> 30:11.106
Just come right in.

30:11.140 --> 30:13.529
There you go.

30:13.570 --> 30:15.379
And grab a seat,
make yourselves at...

30:15.410 --> 30:17.435
at home.

30:19.480 --> 30:23.177
There you go.
There you go.

30:23.220 --> 30:24.983
Mrs. Florrick.

30:25.020 --> 30:26.146
Pastor Isaiah.

30:26.190 --> 30:27.509
How are you?
Hello.

30:27.550 --> 30:29.108
What can I
do for you?

30:29.160 --> 30:31.185
You can leave my son alone.

30:33.230 --> 30:34.197
Won't you come in?

30:34.230 --> 30:36.448
You say you're a man of God;

30:36.500 --> 30:38.559
then stop making him
feel this way.

30:38.600 --> 30:40.295
What way is
that, ma'am?

30:40.330 --> 30:41.638
Like he's a bad man.

30:41.670 --> 30:44.537
He is a bad man.

30:44.570 --> 30:46.435
I'm a bad man. Even
you, Mrs. Florrick.

30:46.470 --> 30:48.404
Who do you think you are?

30:48.440 --> 30:50.203
You think you know people?

30:50.240 --> 30:51.901
You just use the same words
with everyone.

30:51.950 --> 30:54.316
Y-You just say "God"
and you think

30:54.350 --> 30:56.341
you can make people feel bad
about themselves.

30:56.380 --> 31:00.180
Mrs. Florrick, your
son approached me.

31:00.220 --> 31:02.609
He asked advice
from me.

31:02.660 --> 31:05.220
I will continue to
offer that advice.

31:05.260 --> 31:07.922
And I will do everything
in my power to stop you.

31:07.960 --> 31:09.518
You don't know my son.

31:09.560 --> 31:12.358
This is a phase.
You are a phase.

31:13.370 --> 31:15.031
Then we'll see.

31:15.070 --> 31:16.958
No, you'll see.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.434
He's running, this year.

31:19.470 --> 31:23.008
He's my blood; and I don't know
what your God does,

31:23.040 --> 31:25.008
but it doesn't match that.

31:31.550 --> 31:33.609
(knocks quietly)

31:33.650 --> 31:34.685
Dinner.

31:34.720 --> 31:37.450
We'r_e never
getting out.

31:37.490 --> 31:39.583
Let's do it.

31:39.630 --> 31:42.224
(Alicia and Will laughing)

31:42.260 --> 31:43.522
WILL:
The first time we met?

31:43.560 --> 31:46.666
It was a pool
party, wasn't it?

31:46.700 --> 31:48.463
Indoctrination-- or
what do they call it?

31:48.500 --> 31:50.058
Orientation.
(laughs)

31:50.100 --> 31:52.637
Yeah, it was a
midnight pool party.

31:52.670 --> 31:54.274
About a hundred law
students trying to

31:54.310 --> 31:55.629
impress each other.
Did you swim?

31:55.680 --> 31:57.272
No, I was too shy.

31:57.310 --> 31:58.675
You were the one
domg cannonballs.

31:58.710 --> 32:00.507
God, that is so
embarrassing.

32:00.550 --> 32:01.972
Mm-mm.

32:02.020 --> 32:03.510
It wasn't at the time.

32:05.420 --> 32:08.355
So... what did you think of me?

32:08.390 --> 32:10.984
Ah... no.

32:11.030 --> 32:13.089
What?

32:13.130 --> 32:14.552
Dangerous conversation.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.329
Well, now you have to tell me.

32:16.360 --> 32:18.669
Come on, I'll tell you
what I thought of you.

32:18.700 --> 32:21.430
(chuckles)

32:21.470 --> 32:23.438
So Giada seems sweet.

32:23.470 --> 32:24.664
(laughs)

32:24.710 --> 32:25.665
There's a segue.

32:25.710 --> 32:27.063
Yes, she is sweet.

32:27.110 --> 32:28.975
And third year at DePaul.

32:29.010 --> 32:31.001
Yeah, she's just
getting her retainer out.

32:31.050 --> 32:33.041
(chuckles)

32:34.720 --> 32:37.644
So is it always gonna be
this way, between us?

32:37.680 --> 32:39.545
I want to say yes,

32:39.590 --> 32:41.182
but I want to know
what you mean.

32:42.460 --> 32:46.123
Just... talking.

32:46.160 --> 32:48.048
Being casual and...
Blunt?

32:56.500 --> 32:59.037
I like myself
around you, Alicia.

32:59.070 --> 33:01.436
I don't like myself
around a lot of people.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.607
You do.

33:03.640 --> 33:05.176
It's an act.

33:05.210 --> 33:08.213
It's perfected
over a millennium.

33:11.290 --> 33:12.689
(phone ringing)

33:12.720 --> 33:14.711
(chuckles)

33:14.760 --> 33:16.648
Don't answer it.

33:16.690 --> 33:17.759
It's just life again.

33:17.790 --> 33:19.587
Yes, and that's
why I have to.

33:19.630 --> 33:22.121
Hello.

33:22.160 --> 33:23.752
Kalinda, what's up?

33:23.800 --> 33:27.668
No, I'm just with Will.

33:27.700 --> 33:29.031
No.

33:30.800 --> 33:33.803
Okay, I'll...
I'll meet you there.

33:33.840 --> 33:35.478
Kalinda got the dealer

33:35.510 --> 33:36.602
Gorman's phone records.

33:36.640 --> 33:37.777
The night of the shooting,

33:37.810 --> 33:39.573
he had two calls
from a Hank Lydell.

33:39.610 --> 33:41.475
Hank Lydell?
Who's Hank Lydell?

33:41.520 --> 33:42.748
No idea.

33:42.780 --> 33:44.543
Kalinda checked, no priors.

33:44.590 --> 33:45.579
I'm gonna meet her there.

33:45.620 --> 33:47.747
Okay.

33:47.790 --> 33:49.485
Nice dinner.

33:49.520 --> 33:51.750
It was worth the wait.

33:52.830 --> 33:55.048
We always have options, Alicia.

33:57.860 --> 34:00.090
I'm just saying.

34:10.280 --> 34:11.577
(sighs)

34:11.610 --> 34:14.613
(crickets chirping,
dog barking)

34:14.650 --> 34:17.118
We have no idea
who Hank Lydell is?
Mm-hmm.

34:17.150 --> 34:19.243
Or why he was urgently
phoning a meth dealer

34:19.290 --> 34:21.087
an hour before
he killed a cop.

34:21.120 --> 34:22.781
It doesn't look
like an addict's house.

34:22.820 --> 34:26.119
I don't think there is a look
to an addict's house.

34:26.160 --> 34:28.390
Mm.
What were you
doing with Will?

34:28.430 --> 34:31.160
Having dinner.

34:31.200 --> 34:33.168
Thank you for waiting.

34:33.200 --> 34:35.589
Mr. Lydell is
right this way.

34:37.440 --> 34:38.839
That's very unlikely.

34:38.870 --> 34:40.804
Hank has some good days,

34:40.840 --> 34:43.638
but his arthritis keeps him
from dialing the phone.

34:43.680 --> 34:46.672
And you've never heard him
talk about a man named Gorman?

34:46.710 --> 34:48.177
No.

34:48.220 --> 34:50.677
Who else has access
to the phone?

34:52.420 --> 34:53.739
Us?

34:53.790 --> 34:54.779
Nursing care.

34:54.820 --> 34:56.310
Hank has 24-hour
nursmg care.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.225
I have the graveyard shift.

34:58.260 --> 34:59.818
Is there anyway to find out

34:59.860 --> 35:01.851
who was the nurse on duty

35:01.900 --> 35:03.856
the night of the
killing, April 15th?

35:05.870 --> 35:08.737
That was... Trish.

35:08.770 --> 35:10.089
Trish Arkin.

35:12.470 --> 35:15.200
Did I say something wrong?

35:18.350 --> 35:23.879
No. It's just that's
the wife of the deceased.

35:30.390 --> 35:31.880
So our client did it?

35:31.930 --> 35:34.228
She apparently warned
the meth dealer

35:34.260 --> 35:35.693
that _her husband was
coming to arrest him.

35:35.730 --> 35:37.425
How did she even know him?

35:37.460 --> 35:38.825
Apparently through
the husband.

35:38.870 --> 35:40.223
WILL: And the rest
of the task force?

35:40.270 --> 35:41.464
Innocent.

35:41.500 --> 35:43.889
Well, we don't know that
for sure.

35:43.940 --> 35:47.205
But it does look like
it was just Arkin

35:47.240 --> 35:48.901
who was stashing
the weapons and the drugs.

35:48.940 --> 35:51.943
He realized_internal affairs
was looking into him,

35:51.980 --> 35:53.470
so he thought
he would make a deal

35:53.510 --> 35:55.239
and turn on his partners.
And Trish?

35:55.280 --> 35:56.508
KALINDA:
She was a battered woman;

35:56.550 --> 35:58.381
didn't want to enter

35:58.420 --> 35:59.887
witness relocation
with her husband.

35:59.920 --> 36:01.387
Well, that explains the leak.

36:01.420 --> 36:03.354
When we counted
who was in the room,

36:03.390 --> 36:05.483
we didn't count the wife.
Yep.

36:06.630 --> 36:07.881
And you want to hear

36:07.930 --> 36:09.352
an even greater irony?

36:09.400 --> 36:11.368
Cook County wants
to avoid embarrassment.

36:11.400 --> 36:13.322
They just made us an offer

36:13.370 --> 36:15.497
to drop the case.
How much?

36:15.540 --> 36:17.531
A half a million.

36:17.570 --> 36:22.803
So Trish gets her husband
killed, blames the police

36:22.840 --> 36:25.377
and makes a cool half mill.

36:31.450 --> 36:33.941
Are we taking it?

36:33.990 --> 36:37.209
Well, I don't think
we can get them any higher.

36:37.260 --> 36:40.889
No, I mean,
are we taking anything?

36:40.930 --> 36:42.625
She's guilty, and
she'll get off.

36:42.660 --> 36:44.389
She's our client.

36:44.430 --> 36:46.421
It's our job.

36:48.340 --> 36:51.366
And at what point
is our job wrong?

36:51.410 --> 36:52.661
When it fails our client.

36:55.510 --> 36:58.638
So let's advise our client to...
to accept the offer.

37:11.590 --> 37:13.285
(gunshot)

37:13.330 --> 37:15.298
(buzzer sounds)

37:22.470 --> 37:23.732
(gunshot)

37:24.740 --> 37:28.369
(buzzer sounds)

37:50.460 --> 37:52.724
So I seem
to be a suspect.

37:52.770 --> 37:56.661
Apparently, internal affairs
is looking into my connection

37:56.700 --> 37:57.928
with the Arkin shooting.

37:57.970 --> 37:59.631
Yeah, I heard.

37:59.670 --> 38:02.605
This stuff seems to be_
coming from your lawswt.

38:02.640 --> 38:03.800
That's right.

38:03.840 --> 38:07.742
So why all the questions

38:07.780 --> 38:11.079
about what I do for friends?

38:11.120 --> 38:13.543
What, you thought
I did it?

38:15.790 --> 38:17.280
Yeah.

38:19.390 --> 38:21.324
Go to hell.

38:26.430 --> 38:27.624
What?

38:27.670 --> 38:28.830
What?!

38:28.870 --> 38:30.565
Nothing. Ijust, um...

38:36.080 --> 38:37.672
I'm sorry.

38:45.420 --> 38:46.682
What is this?

38:46.720 --> 38:48.688
Who really tipped off Gorman.

38:59.100 --> 39:01.466
(mic feedback)
One, two. Mic check, testing...

39:01.500 --> 39:03.730
So, is this just an
exoneration victory lap

39:03.770 --> 39:05.362
or is he going to announce?

39:05.410 --> 39:06.809
Gail, you'll find out
in one hour.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.398
Oh, come on.

39:08.440 --> 39:10.135
Mrs. Florrick going to
be on stage with him?

39:10.180 --> 39:11.408
(phone ringing)

39:11.450 --> 39:12.576
Excuse me.

39:12.610 --> 39:13.645
This is Gold.

39:13.680 --> 39:16.808
(distant mic feedback squeals)

39:16.850 --> 39:18.681
I don't know.

39:18.720 --> 39:21.382
They're not going to leave us
alone-- the press.

39:21.420 --> 39:22.978
(sighs)
You're right.

39:26.530 --> 39:33.129
You know, I was reading
about these murals in Sienna.

39:33.170 --> 39:36.162
And one of them
showed good government.

39:36.200 --> 39:39.465
People happy.

39:39.510 --> 39:41.705
Buildings going up.

39:41.740 --> 39:43.833
Courts making good decisions.

39:43.880 --> 39:48.977
And on the opposite wall
was bad government.

39:49.020 --> 39:51.170
It was the same people,
but they were...

39:51.220 --> 39:52.619
they were unhappy,

39:52.650 --> 39:54.140
the courts were making
bad decisions.

39:54.190 --> 39:59.822
It occurred to me
that it only works

39:59.860 --> 40:02.693
if people step up...

40:02.730 --> 40:05.858
if you make
the sacrifice.

40:05.900 --> 40:06.798
Look, I was just

40:06.830 --> 40:11.733
an okay state's attorney,
nothing special.

40:11.770 --> 40:15.001
But I want to be a great one.

40:15.040 --> 40:18.771
And I can't do it
without you.

40:21.250 --> 40:23.013
I don't want the kids involved.

40:23.050 --> 40:24.176
They won't be.

40:24.220 --> 40:26.188
And I want to work.

40:26.220 --> 40:30.054
I want you to work.

40:43.770 --> 40:45.635
(clearing throat)

41:06.130 --> 41:08.519
A little more than a year ago,

41:08.560 --> 41:10.050
I stood at this podium

41:10.100 --> 41:13.069
and apologized to the public
and to my family

41:13.100 --> 41:17.059
about a personal failure.
(phone ringing)

41:17.100 --> 41:19.500
I made a very bad mistake.

41:19.540 --> 41:21.974
I betrayed my marital vows.

41:22.010 --> 41:23.102
Hello. Will?

41:23.140 --> 41:25.040
Alicia, hi.

41:25.080 --> 41:26.047
Where are you?

41:26.080 --> 41:27.069
Peter's press conference.

41:27.110 --> 41:29.078
Is everything all right?

41:29.120 --> 41:30.974
Yes.

41:31.020 --> 41:33.818
I was just thinking--
I don't want to go through life

41:33.850 --> 41:35.511
and think something
didn't happen

41:35.560 --> 41:36.982
just because
I didn't make myself clear.

41:37.020 --> 41:38.157
I can't hear you.

41:39.860 --> 41:42.852
I said I want
to make something clear.

41:42.900 --> 41:44.527
Hold on.

41:44.570 --> 41:45.889
PETER:
All those charges were dropped.

41:45.930 --> 41:48.160
That puts me back
where I belong.

41:49.770 --> 41:51.533
Okay, I just need to say it.

41:51.570 --> 41:53.629
We've been up and down,
back and forth,

41:53.670 --> 41:55.934
and I look at you, Alicia,

41:55.980 --> 41:57.129
and I think that...
Will...

41:57.180 --> 41:59.671
No, I just need to say this.
No.

41:59.710 --> 42:01.712
Show me the plan.

42:01.750 --> 42:03.069
The what?

42:03.120 --> 42:04.712
The plan.

42:04.750 --> 42:06.115
I get the romance.

42:06.150 --> 42:07.219
I need a plan.

42:07.250 --> 42:09.912
Not everything needs a plan.

42:09.960 --> 42:11.825
Everything that matters does.

42:11.860 --> 42:14.124
I have two kids that mean
the world to me.

42:14.160 --> 42:15.718
I have the press.

42:15.760 --> 42:16.749
They're just waiting

42:16.800 --> 42:17.858
for a whiff of a new scandal.

42:17.900 --> 42:19.219
And I have a husband.

42:19.270 --> 42:22.990
Justice is what this job
should be about.

42:23.040 --> 42:25.600
So if you want to cut
through all that noise,

42:25.640 --> 42:27.039
then show me a plan.

42:29.640 --> 42:31.699
Poetry is easy.

42:31.750 --> 42:33.149
It's the parent-teacher
conferences that are hard.

42:33.180 --> 42:34.249
Alicia, come on.

42:34.280 --> 42:36.009
I have to go now.
Come on.

42:36.050 --> 42:39.144
I... Okay.

42:42.090 --> 42:46.288
PETER:
Now I realize that
I cannot do this alone.

42:46.330 --> 42:49.788
With your support, I hope to
become the state's attorney

42:49.830 --> 42:51.229
of Cook County once again.

42:51.260 --> 42:53.228
It won't be easy,
but it's necessary.

42:53.270 --> 42:55.090
You're going to make
my life harder.

42:55.140 --> 42:57.267
PETER:
Change it we can,
change it we must,

42:57.300 --> 43:01.771
because Chicago once again
needs a change.

43:01.810 --> 43:04.973
Because Chicago once again
needs a new beginning.

43:05.010 --> 43:06.978
I believe I am that change,

43:07.010 --> 43:09.774
and I believe
that I am that new beginning.

43:09.820 --> 43:10.718
Thank you for listening.

43:10.750 --> 43:12.809
(cheering and applause)

43:18.160 --> 43:20.287
(reporters clamoring)

43:20.330 --> 43:21.319
Alicia.

43:23.030 --> 43:24.861
(phone ringing)

43:30.340 --> 43:32.365
