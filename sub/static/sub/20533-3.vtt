WEBVTT

00:01.919 --> 00:04.003
Previously on 90210...
But a lot of women put off

00:04.045 --> 00:05.506
having their ovaries removed

00:05.547 --> 00:07.257
until after
they've had children.

00:07.299 --> 00:08.383
Want to know what I want?

00:08.425 --> 00:09.468
I want to be pregnant,

00:09.510 --> 00:10.761
and I want
to experience everything,

00:10.803 --> 00:13.054
and if I'm gonna do it,
I have to do it right now.

00:13.096 --> 00:15.098
I didn't have a signal
to call Ade.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.224
I need you to find her

00:16.265 --> 00:17.852
and tell her that I love her.

00:17.893 --> 00:18.936
I can't believe
you took off like that.

00:18.978 --> 00:20.228
You, my friend, have a lot

00:20.270 --> 00:21.856
of explaining to do.

00:22.857 --> 00:23.858
I couldn't move my leg.

00:23.899 --> 00:25.108
You're gonna be fine.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.318
What if it takes too long

00:26.360 --> 00:27.444
and Ade decides not to wait?

00:27.486 --> 00:30.071
How dare you get
into Dixon's head.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.365
He need to accept that he's got

00:31.406 --> 00:33.200
a long road to recovery
or he's never gonna get there.

00:33.241 --> 00:35.911
You don't know what
my brother needs.
Oh, but you do?

00:35.953 --> 00:37.997
Naomi Clark,
will you marry me?

00:38.998 --> 00:41.082
You and Max are a mistake,

00:41.124 --> 00:44.712
and I am not gonna let you
ruin his life again.

00:44.753 --> 00:47.130
I probably should have waited
to announce our engagement.

00:47.172 --> 00:48.799
Vanessa, we are not engaged.

00:48.841 --> 00:50.509
I just want you to love me.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.887
You are completely insane.
Liam, wait.

00:52.928 --> 00:54.429
Let me go!
Please, please, Liam!

00:54.471 --> 00:56.724
No!

00:57.641 --> 00:59.226
My name is Liam Court, uh,

00:59.267 --> 01:01.353
I've just seen an accident.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.814
Uh, I'm sorry, I, uh,

01:03.856 --> 01:05.691
think I made a mistake.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.660
Need I remind you this shower
is a surprise?

01:16.702 --> 01:17.745
Silver's on her way.

01:17.786 --> 01:19.120
I'm hurrying. My God,

01:19.162 --> 01:20.706
I feel like
I'm on Top Chef.

01:20.748 --> 01:21.707
If you were on Top Chef,

01:21.749 --> 01:22.875
you would've been
voted off already.

01:22.917 --> 01:23.918
ADRIANNA:
Hi.

01:23.959 --> 01:25.377
Sorry I'm late.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.337
Did I miss anything?

01:27.379 --> 01:29.798
Oh, the only thing you missed is
Naomi acting like a pastry Nazi.

01:29.840 --> 01:32.551
Everything go okay dropping
off Dixon at physical therapy?

01:32.593 --> 01:35.971
Yeah, but ever since
Naomi's wedding reception,

01:36.013 --> 01:37.138
he seems so discouraged.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.349
I don't know what to do
to get through to him.

01:39.391 --> 01:40.559
But you've been doing a lot.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.101
You know what,
why don't I pick him up

01:42.143 --> 01:43.353
after Silver's
baby-to-be shower?

01:43.395 --> 01:45.355
His recovery could
take a while.

01:45.397 --> 01:47.274
I think we need to pace
ourselves, share the load.

01:47.315 --> 01:49.651
Oh, jewel parfaits
next to Earl Grey truffles?

01:49.693 --> 01:50.861
What are we-- savages?

01:50.903 --> 01:52.071
(scoffs)

01:52.112 --> 01:53.822
Ooh, do you want me
to unpack these?

01:53.864 --> 01:55.908
Oh, no, no, no,
don't touch those.

01:55.950 --> 01:57.284
They're for Alec.

01:57.325 --> 01:58.786
Max is away on business.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.996
This is the perfect time
to try to win him over.

02:01.038 --> 02:02.915
By making him diabetic?
I got Liam

02:02.957 --> 02:04.083
to star in their video game,

02:04.124 --> 02:05.834
I sealed the deal
with the Colton brothers,

02:05.876 --> 02:07.377
and I saved Max
and Alec's business,

02:07.419 --> 02:09.169
but Alec still wants
to freeze me out.

02:09.211 --> 02:10.923
It's not the first time
you've been in a relationship

02:10.965 --> 02:12.049
where the best friend hates you.

02:12.091 --> 02:13.341
True,

02:13.383 --> 02:15.719
but Max and I are not just
in a relationship anymore.

02:15.761 --> 02:16.971
We are in a marriage.

02:17.012 --> 02:18.889
And if we're gonna go
the distance,

02:18.931 --> 02:20.933
Max's BFF has to be my BFF, too.

02:20.975 --> 02:22.142
You and Max

02:22.183 --> 02:24.185
have a history.
Alec is his best friend,

02:24.227 --> 02:25.437
and he thinks you're evil.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.064
You really think cupcakes
are gonna change that?

02:27.106 --> 02:30.776
As the saying goes, they key
to your husband's best friend

02:30.818 --> 02:32.903
and business partner's heart
is through his stomach.

02:32.945 --> 02:34.822
Pretty sure no one
ever said that.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.657
(horn honking, Naomi gasps)
She's here.

02:36.698 --> 02:38.700
Oh, go, go, get your stuff.
Come on.

02:38.742 --> 02:41.078
Aah.

02:41.120 --> 02:44.414
NAOMI:
Okay, girls, places.

02:44.456 --> 02:45.916
Silver is going to be so...

02:45.958 --> 02:47.501
(gasps)

02:48.961 --> 02:50.754
...here. We blew it.

02:50.796 --> 02:52.297
ANNIE: Surprise.
Wait a minute.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.299
I thought this was for our other

02:54.341 --> 02:55.550
about-to-be-inseminated friend.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.260
I'm so surprised!

02:57.302 --> 03:00.305
We wanted one last celebration,
you know, for you

03:00.347 --> 03:03.058
before you get big as a house
and can't see your feet.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.893
Thank you, I think.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.311
Are the presents for me, too?

03:06.353 --> 03:07.437
Oh, yes.

03:07.479 --> 03:08.772
Open mine first.

03:08.814 --> 03:09.773
Mmm.

03:09.815 --> 03:11.441
Thank you.

03:11.483 --> 03:12.985
Well, I'll just tell you
what it is.

03:13.027 --> 03:15.070
It's a private session
with my personal photographer.

03:15.112 --> 03:17.614
So, when you're eight months
along and glowing,

03:17.656 --> 03:19.324
you can get naked
and go all Demi

03:19.366 --> 03:20.575
for everyone
and the camera.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.328
I'll have to work on my very
strategic hand positions.

03:23.370 --> 03:24.955
(laughter)

03:24.997 --> 03:27.082
You guys, this is amazing.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.249
Oh, of course.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.502
It's not every day
a friend gets inseminated.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.671
So, when is
the big appointment?

03:32.713 --> 03:34.965
Um, I...

03:35.007 --> 03:36.466
I actually haven't made it yet.

03:36.508 --> 03:38.552
But I thought you had
your basal temperature charts

03:38.593 --> 03:41.262
and hormone graphs
and tomorrow had to be go day?

03:41.304 --> 03:43.765
Yeah, it does.

03:43.807 --> 03:45.184
It's just...

03:45.225 --> 03:47.310
Every time I pick up the phone

03:47.352 --> 03:49.188
to call
and make the appointment,

03:49.229 --> 03:51.231
I... don't.

03:51.272 --> 03:52.691
NAOMI:
Well, who could blame you?

03:52.733 --> 03:54.651
(chuckles)
I mean, getting pregnant

03:54.693 --> 03:56.945
means getting fat, getting ugly,

03:56.987 --> 03:59.280
having strangers
rub up on your baby bump.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.324
Okay, I didn't get fat or ugly.

04:01.366 --> 04:02.826
Yeah, sure you didn't, honey.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.745
(laughs)
It's not about that.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.663
I know that
if I'm gonna have kids,

04:06.705 --> 04:10.458
I need to do it now, but...

04:10.500 --> 04:12.086
I'm 20 years old.

04:12.127 --> 04:14.254
I'm supposed to be the kid.

04:14.295 --> 04:16.882
I-I guess I just don't know

04:16.923 --> 04:19.300
if I'm ready
to be so responsible yet.

04:19.341 --> 04:21.511
Well, then don't be
so responsible.

04:21.553 --> 04:23.638
You have 24 hours left
of being a kid.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.516
Let's go have
some irresponsible fun.

04:26.558 --> 04:28.268
Like crazy Silver fun.

04:28.309 --> 04:29.477
Then after that,

04:29.519 --> 04:31.688
maybe the idea of having a kid
won't be so scary.

04:31.730 --> 04:32.898
(doorbell rings)
Oh,

04:32.940 --> 04:35.859
that must be
my other present for you.

04:35.901 --> 04:38.195
Okay, so...

04:38.237 --> 04:40.488
act like a kid to have a kid.

04:40.530 --> 04:42.407
(chuckles) It's actually
not such a bad idea.

04:42.449 --> 04:43.742
Yeah.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.953
Wait, why did you say "actually"
like you were surprised?

04:45.994 --> 04:48.038
(laughs)
NAOMI:
Ladies.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.793
It's about to get really...

04:52.834 --> 04:54.544
hot in here.

04:54.586 --> 04:56.964
(laughs) If you want
to be irresponsible,

04:57.005 --> 04:59.174
maybe you should do
it with this guy.

04:59.216 --> 05:00.259
(dance music playing)

05:00.300 --> 05:01.676
SILVER: No...

05:01.718 --> 05:04.263
Oh, yes.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.265
(laughter)
Oh.

05:09.143 --> 05:12.062
♪ ♪

05:14.606 --> 05:15.899
(screams)

05:15.941 --> 05:18.359
Come on, Dixon,
I need more from you.

05:18.401 --> 05:19.945
I'm trying.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.780
Well, try harder.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.074
There you go.

05:24.116 --> 05:26.326
Come on.

05:30.455 --> 05:33.083
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
it was time to relax.

05:33.125 --> 05:34.459
You-you want me to get
you something?

05:34.501 --> 05:37.420
Like an ice tea or maybe a shawl
for your leg since you don't

05:37.462 --> 05:38.880
ever seem to want
to use those again?

05:38.922 --> 05:41.716
Hey, is he always
this much of a jerk?

05:41.758 --> 05:44.094
Riley? Well, he's tough,
but he's a hero.

05:44.136 --> 05:45.095
He had to be to survive

05:45.137 --> 05:46.345
what happened to him
in Afghanistan.

05:49.308 --> 05:51.392
Hey, that was great.

05:51.434 --> 05:52.853
You were so close.

05:52.894 --> 05:55.939
Yeah, um, but close to walking
isn't really walking, is it?

05:57.274 --> 05:59.358
I'll meet you in the front.

06:01.278 --> 06:03.905
You know, you could
go easier on him.

06:03.947 --> 06:05.324
This isn't boot camp.

06:05.364 --> 06:08.493
Dixon doesn't need someone
to sing him lullabies right now.

06:08.535 --> 06:10.287
What he needs is
to get out of that chair.

06:10.329 --> 06:12.580
He'll get out of the
chair when he's ready.
He is ready.

06:12.622 --> 06:14.373
Just got his medical report.
He's strong enough,

06:14.415 --> 06:16.293
the dexterity in his arms
and legs have come back.

06:16.335 --> 06:18.461
So what, you're saying
it's all in his head?

06:18.503 --> 06:20.463
He was in a horrible accident.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.132
Oh, I know. I know.

06:22.174 --> 06:25.510
"I'm the only one who's ever
been in a car accident, poor me.

06:25.552 --> 06:26.928
What's the point?"

06:26.970 --> 06:28.263
Dixon plays the victim

06:28.305 --> 06:30.140
better than half the actors
in this town.

06:30.182 --> 06:31.808
Till he shelves that attitude,

06:31.850 --> 06:33.268
he's never gonna get any better.

06:33.310 --> 06:34.311
He's trying.

06:34.353 --> 06:35.729
He's failing.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.438
And somebody needs
to get through to him.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.067
Well, that somebody
is not gonna be you.

06:44.363 --> 06:45.822
(sirens wailing)

06:45.864 --> 06:47.908
(helicopter blades whirring)

06:48.992 --> 06:50.160
Stop!

06:50.202 --> 06:51.245
Police!

06:52.079 --> 06:53.496
Put your hands up!

06:53.538 --> 06:54.831
You're wanted for murder.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.214
DIRECTOR:
All right, good, Liam.

07:02.256 --> 07:03.548
Right hook.

07:03.590 --> 07:04.674
And cut.

07:04.716 --> 07:05.842
(groans, applause)

07:05.884 --> 07:07.426
ALEC:
All right.

07:07.468 --> 07:09.221
Everything looks great.

07:09.263 --> 07:11.514
The Colton brothers are gonna be
thrilled with the game.

07:11.556 --> 07:12.933
Oh, thank God.
I don't know

07:12.974 --> 07:14.601
if I can take another
day in this suit.

07:14.642 --> 07:16.519
I kind of feel like
I'm at ninja camp.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.479
Oh, by the way,
your business partner

07:18.521 --> 07:20.357
still hasn't signed
your contract. Is she around?

07:20.399 --> 07:21.775
Vanessa?
Yeah.

07:21.816 --> 07:24.485
No, she is out of town.

07:24.527 --> 07:25.737
Well, when will she be back?

07:25.779 --> 07:27.906
I don't know. I think
it's gonna be a while.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.199
Wow.

07:29.241 --> 07:31.159
You keep your fiancée
on a short leash, don't you?

07:31.201 --> 07:33.787
(chuckles)
Just, you know,
get her down here.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.247
Unless she signs off,
we can't finish production.

07:35.289 --> 07:36.706
Yeah, sure, absolutely.
Okay?

07:36.748 --> 07:38.708
Hey, Liam, nice balls.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.543
Thank you.

07:40.585 --> 07:43.463
There he is, the second most
attractive CEO at the company.

07:43.504 --> 07:44.839
With Max in Japan,

07:44.881 --> 07:47.508
you're looking
for someone else's life to ruin.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.469
Alec, we're the two closest
people in his life.

07:49.510 --> 07:51.012
I'm her to bury the hatchet.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.806
Hopefully not literally.

07:52.847 --> 07:55.016
Peace offering?

07:55.058 --> 07:57.227
I'm allergic to wheat.
Pass.

07:57.269 --> 07:59.313
They're gluten-free.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.106
I called and asked
your assistant.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.607
Why do you care so much?

08:02.649 --> 08:05.360
I care because, contrary
to what you may believe,

08:05.402 --> 08:06.778
my commitment to
Max is real.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.280
I want him to be happy.

08:08.322 --> 08:10.782
And if you and I are
good, Max is good.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.452
So, maybe,

08:13.493 --> 08:15.495
before he gets back,
we can be friends?

08:15.536 --> 08:17.705
I have a business to run, okay,

08:17.747 --> 08:19.416
and a full schedule
of appointments.

08:19.458 --> 08:22.752
So, I don't have time
to be your friend.

08:32.886 --> 08:35.307
Thanks, Annie, for putting
the jelly on the top shelf.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.642
Guess I'm stuck with peanut
butter and mayonnaise.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.727
Sorry.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.022
Hey, uh,
Liam's on his way over.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.483
Thought maybe you two
could hang out and talk?

08:44.524 --> 08:46.776
About whatever, you know,
just life.

08:46.818 --> 08:47.861
How you're feeling?

08:47.902 --> 08:49.446
Yeah, and about
that cute guy in school

08:49.488 --> 08:50.905
who hasn't called me yet?

08:50.947 --> 08:52.115
Seriously, have you met

08:52.157 --> 08:53.492
me and Liam?

08:53.533 --> 08:54.617
Hey.

08:54.659 --> 08:56.203
Hey, man.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.330
(exhales)
What's up, man?

08:58.372 --> 08:59.414
Not me.

08:59.456 --> 09:02.583
So, uh, Liam, weren't
you telling me

09:02.625 --> 09:04.336
about some West Bev
Alumni Surf event?

09:04.378 --> 09:05.628
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.297
Yeah, yeah, it's going
off tomorrow. We should go.

09:07.339 --> 09:08.548
Uh, no-no, thank you.

09:08.589 --> 09:10.133
Probably not this year.

09:10.175 --> 09:12.219
All the old surf team's gonna be
schooling the new squad.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.553
It'll be fun.
Sitting on the beach

09:13.594 --> 09:14.929
watching a bunch of guys

09:14.971 --> 09:16.515
do something I can't do anymore

09:16.556 --> 09:18.599
just sounds like a blast.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.273
(door closes)

09:25.315 --> 09:26.358
Yeah, I suck.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.901
No, it's not
your fault.

09:27.942 --> 09:29.361
He's just going through
something that none of us

09:29.403 --> 09:31.654
really understand.
Thanks for trying.

09:31.696 --> 09:32.906
Sure.

09:32.947 --> 09:34.908
Hey, I wanted to ask you
a favor.

09:34.949 --> 09:38.036
Um, I need to talk to a lawyer
about a contract issue.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.330
Why, did Vanessa get you
to sign away your soul?

09:40.372 --> 09:41.915
Yeah, something like that.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.084
No, I just thought with all the
stuff that you'd been through

09:44.125 --> 09:45.960
with Marla's will
that you might know someone.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.962
Yeah, actually, uh,
Lindsey Beckwith.

09:48.004 --> 09:50.090
She helped me set up
my foundation.

09:50.131 --> 09:53.343
She's an attorney and teaches
a business law class at CU.

09:53.385 --> 09:55.345
Beckwith. Okay. Great, thanks.

09:55.387 --> 09:57.222
No problem. I'm just glad
you're finally doing something

09:57.264 --> 09:58.639
to get rid of that psychopath.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.767
(chuckles)
Yeah.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.189
MAN:
Is anybody here? Hello?

10:08.149 --> 10:10.026
Can I help you?
I'm looking for Liam Court.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.819
You found him.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.696
Detective Thompsen.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.490
Los Angeles Police Department.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.867
I've got a few questions about
a missing person you might know.

10:17.909 --> 10:20.078
Vanessa Shaw.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.793
(theme music playing)

10:42.225 --> 10:44.227
So, uh, what exactly do you need
to know about Vanessa?

10:44.269 --> 10:46.938
I can't get into the details
of an open investigation.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.982
I've got a few questions
for Miss Shaw,

10:49.023 --> 10:50.775
and I haven't been
able to find her.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.486
This bar is her
last known address.

10:52.527 --> 10:54.321
She moved out months ago.

10:54.362 --> 10:57.240
Really? I thought you just
announced your engagement

10:57.282 --> 10:58.492
at a party last week?

10:59.784 --> 11:02.496
My teenage daughter
follows you on Twitter.

11:02.537 --> 11:05.499
Yeah, well, you can't believe
everything you read.

11:05.540 --> 11:06.791
Vanessa does my PR.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.084
I actually haven't
seen her since the party.

11:08.126 --> 11:09.710
You haven't seen your fiancée
and business partner

11:09.752 --> 11:11.171
in over a week and
you're not concerned?

11:11.212 --> 11:13.256
I told you,
she's not my fiancée.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.426
We, uh, actually
never really got along.

11:16.468 --> 11:18.553
Yeah, most couples
don't feel that way

11:18.595 --> 11:19.846
until after the wedding.
Yeah.

11:19.887 --> 11:21.097
Well, most couples don't meet

11:21.139 --> 11:22.723
when one of them runs
the other one over with a car.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.225
I'm sorry.

11:24.267 --> 11:25.644
If knew where she was,
I would tell you.

11:25.684 --> 11:28.271
Well, if you think of
anything else, give me a call.

11:28.313 --> 11:30.190
But if we don't find her,

11:30.231 --> 11:32.942
I'm sure you and I
will be talking again.
Yeah.

11:32.984 --> 11:36.070
Thanks for your time,
Mr. Court.
Mm-hmm.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.536
ANNIE:
Getting out of the house

11:42.577 --> 11:44.204
is part of your recovery.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.664
You have to stop moping

11:45.704 --> 11:47.748
and start doing stuff
that makes you feel better.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.126
Or something that
makes you feel better?

11:50.168 --> 11:52.671
Okay. Okay. Fine.

11:52.711 --> 11:54.839
So, uh, what class is this
that you signed me up for?

11:54.881 --> 11:56.424
Standing 101?

11:56.466 --> 11:57.676
Hi, Annie.
Hi.

11:57.716 --> 11:58.677
Dixon, hi, I'm Sam.

11:58.717 --> 12:00.512
I'm the trauma counselor.
Hey.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.389
Annie told me about what
you've been going through.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.849
I'm pretty sure
group therapy will help.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.518
Hi, how are you
feeling today?

12:06.560 --> 12:08.436
Oh, hell, no.

12:08.478 --> 12:09.812
Dixon, please.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.606
Annie, give me my chair.
No.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.732
You need more than physical
therapy to get better.

12:13.774 --> 12:15.318
You have to talk
about your issues.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.778
My only issue
is that a truck driver

12:17.820 --> 12:19.239
speeding down
Dry Creek Highway--

12:19.280 --> 12:22.033
maybe high on meth--
put me in this chair.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.742
How's talking about it
gonna get me out of it?

12:23.784 --> 12:25.078
Just try it.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.287
For me?

12:31.959 --> 12:34.546
Okay. Okay, fine.

12:34.588 --> 12:35.880
But when you get back,
if I'm walking,

12:35.922 --> 12:36.923
I'm gonna kill you.

12:36.964 --> 12:39.967
I will pick you up in an hour.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.470
All right, let's take
a seat, everyone.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.472
Get started.

12:44.514 --> 12:46.558
SAM:
How you feeling today?

12:47.975 --> 12:49.977
Wasn't that awesome?

12:50.019 --> 12:52.105
Would two mature adults
go see the breakfast screening

12:52.146 --> 12:53.398
of Zombie Murderers From Hell?

12:53.440 --> 12:55.567
Not on a full stomach,
they wouldn't.
(giggles)

12:55.609 --> 12:57.026
Okay, let's see what's next.

12:57.068 --> 12:58.152
All right.

12:58.194 --> 12:59.446
"Kiss a stranger,

12:59.487 --> 13:02.240
hitchhike a ride
from a biker gang..."

13:02.282 --> 13:03.575
Go home.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.076
Um, no.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.579
We still have a list of
crazy fun things left to do.

13:07.621 --> 13:09.080
I know, Ade, but...

13:09.122 --> 13:11.832
being irresponsible isn't making
me feel ready to be a mom.

13:11.874 --> 13:15.044
This is...
I'm still scared.
Okay.

13:15.086 --> 13:17.547
Well, then, maybe this has more
to do with facing your fears.

13:17.589 --> 13:19.758
And what better way
of overcoming fear

13:19.798 --> 13:20.925
than by conquering
your biggest one?

13:20.967 --> 13:22.927
We're doing number five.
Ade. No.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.305
I can't do number five.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.390
I've been afraid of number
five since I was five.

13:27.432 --> 13:28.600
Silver.

13:28.642 --> 13:30.310
You walked away from Liam
and Navid to have this baby.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.437
You can't let anything else
stand in your way.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.772
Oh, fine.

13:33.812 --> 13:35.189
But I wouldn't be so afraid

13:35.231 --> 13:37.275
if I wasn't already worried
about the zombie apocalypse.

13:39.818 --> 13:42.530
That was a great way
to open the session.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.616
Thanks, Chris.

13:45.575 --> 13:46.576
Dixon.

13:46.618 --> 13:48.244
I know this is your
first time, but

13:48.286 --> 13:49.954
is there anything you'd
like to talk about today?

13:49.996 --> 13:52.165
I don't know,
I'm sorry, man.

13:52.206 --> 13:55.001
Um, what happened to me
wasn't my fault.

13:55.042 --> 13:56.961
It was somebody else's
stupid mistake.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.296
There was nothing
I could do about it,

13:58.338 --> 14:01.048
so I kind of feel it's pointless
to talk about it.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.384
Talking about it can actually
change how you feel.

14:03.426 --> 14:05.136
But a lot of people
feel uncomfortable

14:05.178 --> 14:06.763
talking during
their first session.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.599
How about you, Megan?

14:09.641 --> 14:11.225
You've been here
a few times.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.019
Do you feel comfortable
sharing your story today?

14:13.060 --> 14:14.895
Uh...

14:14.937 --> 14:17.023
Yeah, I think so.

14:19.442 --> 14:21.778
Well, uh, the thing
that happened to me

14:21.820 --> 14:25.448
didn't actually happen to me.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.534
It was my dad.

14:27.575 --> 14:30.203
He died in a car crash,

14:30.244 --> 14:32.038
and it's been really hard,

14:32.079 --> 14:33.748
because it feels like
it was my fault.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.459
My dad was a truck driver,

14:36.501 --> 14:39.379
and about a month ago he was
driving down Dry Creek Highway,

14:39.420 --> 14:41.756
when this car
with three guys in it

14:41.798 --> 14:43.049
pulled in front of him.

14:43.090 --> 14:46.344
And he didn't have time to stop.
DIXON:
Whoa, whoa.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.637
Dry Creek Highway?

14:47.679 --> 14:49.514
Let her finish.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.559
We just got the toxicology
report back, and...

14:52.600 --> 14:54.935
there were no drugs
or alcohol in his system.

14:54.977 --> 14:55.895
All I can think

14:55.936 --> 14:57.564
is he was working
too many hours,

14:57.605 --> 14:59.273
or not getting
enough sleep,

14:59.315 --> 15:02.443
and all to pay
for my stupid tuition.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.781
And now they're all dead,
and it's all my fault.

15:06.823 --> 15:07.948
I need my chair.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.992
Dixon, are you okay?
No.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.495
No, I-I... I'm...
I need to get out of here.

15:12.537 --> 15:14.706
I need my chair, please.
SAM:
Okay. Okay.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.881
I'm sorry, everybody.

15:30.304 --> 15:31.598
Hello.

15:31.639 --> 15:32.766
I'm Alec Martin.

15:32.807 --> 15:34.183
I have a lunch meeting
with Muriel Wentworth.

15:34.225 --> 15:35.560
She's upstairs, sir.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.645
Thanks.
All right.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.194
Naomi.

15:45.236 --> 15:47.113
What are you doing here?

15:47.154 --> 15:48.239
I'm having breakfast.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.074
With you.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.451
Okay.

15:51.492 --> 15:53.453
Why do I have a feeling
that Muriel Wentworth,

15:53.494 --> 15:55.705
billionaire widow to software
mogul Linus Wentworth,

15:55.747 --> 15:58.332
isn't coming to the meeting
I prepared for half the night?

15:58.374 --> 16:00.251
Okay, okay.

16:00.293 --> 16:03.212
So I'm not a 70-year-old
Botox queen.
Yet.

16:03.254 --> 16:06.340
But I knew you'd
clear your schedule

16:06.382 --> 16:08.259
for one of the richest women
in the world.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.637
And since we both have
a full afternoon off, now,

16:10.678 --> 16:12.639
I figured, why not
get to know each other?

16:12.680 --> 16:14.682
It would take
a band of pirates

16:14.724 --> 16:16.976
to keep me on this boat.

16:17.017 --> 16:18.352
(horn blows)
Or just a captain

16:18.394 --> 16:19.687
with impeccable timing.

16:19.729 --> 16:22.440
(engine rumbles)
I think you're stuck with me.

16:24.859 --> 16:26.736
(horn blows)

16:34.786 --> 16:37.664
Are you really gonna
sit there and sulk all day?
I'm not sulking.

16:37.705 --> 16:40.124
I'm communicating with
sharks in the vicinity.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.168
Oh, really?
And are they listening?

16:42.209 --> 16:44.545
You're still here,
so, no.
Look, Alec,

16:44.587 --> 16:46.798
I realize you think
I'm a pain in the ass.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.091
Maybe I am.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.384
But I'm not going anywhere.

16:50.426 --> 16:51.719
Max and I are going
to be together

16:51.761 --> 16:52.846
for the rest of our lives.

16:52.887 --> 16:54.555
So if you won't make
an effort for me,

16:54.597 --> 16:55.974
would you at least do it
for him?

16:58.935 --> 17:00.102
You know, you're right.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.104
I am?
Yeah.

17:02.146 --> 17:03.523
I have been pretty tough on you.

17:03.564 --> 17:04.983
Maybe I haven't
given you a chance.

17:05.023 --> 17:07.484
The truth is, I tend not to be
very tolerant of other people.

17:07.527 --> 17:08.944
Me, either!

17:08.987 --> 17:10.738
In fact, I'm downright
intolerant, I mean...

17:10.780 --> 17:12.740
I have trouble
connecting to people.

17:12.781 --> 17:15.159
I grew up wealthy, and
my parents sheltered me

17:15.201 --> 17:17.203
so I didn't have a
lot of friends, and...

17:17.243 --> 17:20.330
You don't want to
hear all this.
Yes, of...

17:20.373 --> 17:21.624
Of course I do.

17:21.665 --> 17:25.752
My parents used to drag me
to these galas in Newport Beach.

17:25.795 --> 17:28.130
I would sneak off just to
see other kids hanging out

17:28.172 --> 17:29.841
so I could learn
how to do it.

17:29.883 --> 17:32.051
The boardwalk on Balboa
Peninsula was the best part

17:32.092 --> 17:33.427
about being a kid.

17:33.469 --> 17:34.929
Shut up.
(laughs)
Yeah.

17:34.971 --> 17:37.807
My dad used to take me to that
boardwalk every time we'd finish

17:37.849 --> 17:39.058
sailing
in the harbor.
Really?

17:39.099 --> 17:40.351
We'd go to Frosty's
and get ice cream,

17:40.393 --> 17:41.519
go up on the Ferris wheel,

17:41.561 --> 17:42.937
rent bikes.
I mean...

17:42.979 --> 17:44.397
Mm, yeah.

17:44.438 --> 17:45.732
It's 20 minutes away.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.233
We could cruise down
and see if it's still the same.

17:47.274 --> 17:50.319
Oh, I don't know. I really
should get back to the office.

17:50.361 --> 17:52.488
Oh, for God's sakes,
stop thinking about work.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.407
Do something fun
for once in your life.

17:54.448 --> 17:56.659
Okay.

17:56.701 --> 18:01.664
I have to make a few calls,
but then... I'm all in.

18:01.706 --> 18:03.708
(laughs)

18:03.750 --> 18:05.459
(sighs)

18:08.295 --> 18:10.214
Wow.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.675
Whoever put this deal
together really hates you.

18:12.717 --> 18:14.844
Any one of my first year law
students would know better

18:14.886 --> 18:17.471
than to sign this, but I
guess they don't teach you

18:17.513 --> 18:19.557
about contracts
in acting school.

18:19.599 --> 18:20.892
I didn't go to acting school.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.309
I just assumed

18:22.351 --> 18:23.978
the star of Corporate Invaders
was classically trained.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.980
That's funny.

18:26.022 --> 18:28.441
Yeah. Maybe laughter
will help mask the pain.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.192
Look, I'd help you if I could,

18:30.234 --> 18:33.029
but this contract links you
and Vanessa for three years.

18:33.071 --> 18:35.073
Unless you could prove that
the deal was fraudulent,

18:35.114 --> 18:37.658
she would have to agree to
dissolve the partnership.

18:37.700 --> 18:39.869
Which means,

18:39.911 --> 18:41.328
you either have
to wait out the terms,

18:41.370 --> 18:42.789
or hope she gets hit by a bus.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.540
Uh, actually,

18:44.582 --> 18:46.626
there's something else
I wanted to-to ask you.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.920
Uh, I'm researching a role
for an upcoming role,

18:48.962 --> 18:51.756
and I just want to better
understand my character.

18:51.798 --> 18:54.968
What would happen if, um,
somebody saw an accident

18:55.009 --> 18:57.428
and did nothing about it?

18:57.470 --> 19:00.681
It would depend
on how serious the accident was.

19:00.723 --> 19:03.350
For actively ignoring
something that proved fatal,

19:03.392 --> 19:05.895
that person could be charged
with manslaughter.

19:06.854 --> 19:08.648
Wow.

19:08.689 --> 19:09.941
You actually look worried.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.525
Maybe you can act.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.402
I have to
get to class.

19:13.444 --> 19:15.571
I'm sorry
I couldn't help you.
Thanks.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.534
Liam?

19:20.576 --> 19:22.078
Have you seen Dixon?

19:22.120 --> 19:23.871
I thought
he wouldn't leave the house.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.581
Well, I kind of
forced him to,

19:25.623 --> 19:26.916
and now I've come
to pick him up,

19:26.958 --> 19:27.959
and he's not here.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.460
He'll probably...
I don't know.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.504
He's on campus or something.
He'll probably turn up.

19:31.545 --> 19:34.340
Right. So I guess I'll just
go home, cross my fingers,

19:34.381 --> 19:36.884
and hope he doesn't roll
his chair off a cliff.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.845
I'm sorry. I've just
got a lot on my mind.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.346
I'm sure Dixon does, too.

19:40.387 --> 19:44.058
You know, maybe he just needed
some time to get away and think.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.435
I know I do.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.064
Mmm. Mmm!

19:50.106 --> 19:53.359
I can't believe Frosty
remembered your name!

19:53.400 --> 19:55.945
The king of the boardwalk
knows who you are.

19:55.987 --> 19:57.947
What can I say?
I hang with royalty.

19:57.989 --> 20:00.658
Oh, my God, the Bay
Arcade! I forgot!

20:00.700 --> 20:03.369
I used to spend hours
playing Skee-Ball,

20:03.410 --> 20:06.039
trying to win enough tickets
get to a silver unicorn.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.373
That never happened.

20:07.414 --> 20:08.958
Do you know what?

20:09.000 --> 20:11.418
I think it's time
to get you that silver unicorn.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.379
Come on.
(Naomi laughs)

20:13.420 --> 20:15.339
I can do this.

20:15.381 --> 20:18.634
I conquer this fear,
I conquer all fears, right?

20:18.676 --> 20:20.469
Totally.
Yeah.

20:20.511 --> 20:22.096
Unless you die tragically.

20:22.138 --> 20:23.097
What?!

20:23.139 --> 20:24.306
I'm kidding. You got this.

20:24.348 --> 20:25.474
MAN:
Ready to fly?

20:25.516 --> 20:27.393
Ready as I'll ever be.

20:27.434 --> 20:29.187
When I say let
go, just let go.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.815
Okay, got it.
MAN:
Here we go.

20:32.857 --> 20:36.276
Ready. Set. Hut.

20:36.318 --> 20:39.530
Go. Yeah!
Leg's up! Leg's up!

20:39.572 --> 20:41.365
(shrieks)

20:41.407 --> 20:43.659
MAN:
Hands off. Look up.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.494
Nice!
Oh, I'm doing it!

20:45.536 --> 20:47.413
I'm really doing it!
MAN:
Yeah!

20:47.454 --> 20:49.040
MAN:
Turn! Turn!

20:49.082 --> 20:50.374
Yes!

20:50.416 --> 20:51.500
(cheering)

20:51.542 --> 20:53.419
(whooping)
MAN:
Yes!

20:53.460 --> 20:54.879
(whoops and clapping)
MAN:
All right.

20:56.881 --> 20:59.217
(gasps)

20:59.258 --> 21:00.968
(laughter)

21:01.010 --> 21:02.178
Nice. Nice!

21:02.220 --> 21:04.847
(laughs)

21:04.889 --> 21:06.891
I did it!

21:06.933 --> 21:10.144
I knocked out number five!
I kicked fear's ass!

21:10.186 --> 21:12.354
That was so good.
Okay.

21:12.396 --> 21:14.982
Oh. Ow! Oh. Oh.

21:15.024 --> 21:16.483
Okay, that did not look so good.

21:16.525 --> 21:17.651
SILVER:
Oh!

21:17.693 --> 21:18.903
You okay?
No.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.155
My ankle, my ankle, my ankle.

21:21.197 --> 21:24.366
ALEC: All right.
NAOMI:
Okay. The token guy said
this is the only silver unicorn

21:24.408 --> 21:26.285
on the peninsula,
so you have to get it.

21:26.326 --> 21:28.079
Listen, I am a master
on these machines, okay?

21:28.121 --> 21:29.956
I'm just getting a
feel for this puppy.
Mm-hmm.

21:29.997 --> 21:32.416
We'll get it this time.
No doubt, no doubt, all right?

21:32.458 --> 21:33.960
You said that
about 20 minutes ago.

21:34.001 --> 21:35.377
Okay. Uh...

21:35.419 --> 21:37.421
Okay, steady, steady. Yes, yes,
yes, right there, right there.

21:37.463 --> 21:38.798
Right there.
Easy, easy.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.007
Oh, yes, yes, right there.

21:40.049 --> 21:41.425
ALEC:
Easy.

21:41.467 --> 21:42.593
Got it!
Yes!

21:42.635 --> 21:43.719
(Alec laughs)
Yes!
Yes!

21:43.761 --> 21:45.054
(dinging)
(laughs)

21:45.096 --> 21:46.430
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

21:46.472 --> 21:47.890
(both laugh)

21:47.932 --> 21:50.059
(laughs)
Told you.

21:51.644 --> 21:53.062
(gasps)

21:54.354 --> 21:56.149
No, no. No, no,
no, no, no, no.

21:56.190 --> 21:58.609
Naomi, wait.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.360
We need to talk
about this!

22:00.402 --> 22:03.363
No. We're not talking
about this because this...

22:03.405 --> 22:05.199
this never happened!

22:13.833 --> 22:16.085
Oh, Naomi, thank
God you're back.

22:16.127 --> 22:17.711
I lost Dixon.
Have you seen him?

22:17.753 --> 22:20.047
No, and how do you lose a guy
who can't move?

22:20.089 --> 22:21.799
Well, because I pushed
him too hard to get

22:21.841 --> 22:23.759
what I wanted
and it blew up in my face, okay?

22:23.801 --> 22:26.637
Yeah, that pretty much
sums up my day, too.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.681
But sorry I have no idea
where Dixon is.

22:28.722 --> 22:31.558
Guess I don't know my brother
as well as I thought I did.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.060
If you don't, who does?

22:33.102 --> 22:34.436
Riley.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.563
Who's Riley?
Dixon's jerky,

22:36.605 --> 22:37.898
know-it-all
physical therapist.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.317
He acts like being
in a wheelchair

22:39.357 --> 22:41.359
gives him some special insight
into Dixon that I don't have.

22:41.401 --> 22:43.196
It's like they're
in a club.

22:43.237 --> 22:44.822
And now I actually sound
like I'm jealous

22:44.864 --> 22:46.073
that I'm not in a wheelchair.

22:46.115 --> 22:48.034
Yeah, you kind of do.

22:48.075 --> 22:50.619
But thanks for making me
feel better about my day.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.380
Well, hello, sunshine.

23:02.422 --> 23:04.633
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

23:04.675 --> 23:06.010
Dixon doesn't
have a session today.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.385
I need your help.

23:07.427 --> 23:09.763
I wanted Dixon
to talk about his issues

23:09.805 --> 23:13.017
and so I ambushed him
into group therapy.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.060
You did what?

23:14.101 --> 23:15.644
Apparently he
got upset and left

23:15.686 --> 23:18.022
in the middle of the session,
and no one's seen him since.

23:18.064 --> 23:21.608
So my assessment
that your brother's problem

23:21.650 --> 23:22.943
was mental is just way off.

23:22.985 --> 23:24.611
I took your advice
and I tried

23:24.653 --> 23:26.906
to get through to him,
but it did not work.

23:26.947 --> 23:29.950
And now I can't find him.

23:29.992 --> 23:31.952
Well, what do you
want my help for?

23:31.994 --> 23:34.121
I don't know your brother
at all, remember?
Can you just drop

23:34.163 --> 23:36.123
the tough love drill sergeant
bit for two minutes?

23:36.165 --> 23:37.875
I get it...
You are a war hero

23:37.917 --> 23:39.793
who's an expert
in all things wheelchair.

23:41.170 --> 23:43.047
So tell me where my brother is.

23:44.798 --> 23:49.053
Yeah, look,
if-if Dixon is upset

23:49.095 --> 23:50.888
talking about the accident,
that means he's...

23:50.930 --> 23:53.057
he's finally processing
the day of the crash.

23:53.099 --> 23:54.600
He's wondering what
life would've been like

23:54.641 --> 23:56.310
had he not gotten
in that car

23:56.352 --> 23:58.062
and driven down that road.

23:58.104 --> 24:00.189
So what would have
life been like?

24:00.231 --> 24:01.690
Where was he headed that day?

24:01.732 --> 24:05.652
He was on his way to meet
Ade at the Santa Monica Pier.

24:06.653 --> 24:07.863
SILVER:
Okay, so...

24:07.905 --> 24:11.409
what do you do when the feat
to conquer all fears

24:11.449 --> 24:12.785
is an epic fail?

24:12.826 --> 24:14.578
Okay, hey,
you weren't that bad.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.372
You conquered
most of it.

24:16.414 --> 24:18.040
Hey, I'm gonna go
get the car.

24:18.082 --> 24:19.417
You stay here.
Yeah?

24:19.457 --> 24:20.918
Unless number six
on your list

24:20.960 --> 24:22.086
is falling off
the curb.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.879
Ha. Oh...

24:23.921 --> 24:26.464
I'll be right back.
Very funny.

24:26.506 --> 24:28.301
Erin Silver?

24:28.342 --> 24:29.885
Suzanne, hi.
What are you doing here?

24:29.927 --> 24:31.345
Oh, you know us
BRCA gene patients,

24:31.387 --> 24:34.681
we're always finding some reason
to be at the hospital.

24:34.723 --> 24:37.559
Though it's not usually
foot related. Are you okay?

24:37.601 --> 24:39.270
Yeah, it's just
a sprained ankle.

24:39.312 --> 24:40.980
Nothing life threatening.

24:42.315 --> 24:44.524
I decided to have a...

24:44.566 --> 24:46.986
a baby before
the BRCA gene surgeries.

24:47.027 --> 24:49.405
A friend of mine
talked me into conquering

24:49.447 --> 24:51.073
some of my fears, and, uh,

24:51.115 --> 24:53.200
it didn't really work out.

24:53.242 --> 24:55.535
How have you been?

24:55.577 --> 24:56.996
I'm great.

24:57.037 --> 24:59.248
The good news is
I lost a couple pounds.

24:59.290 --> 25:02.042
The bad news is
it was all boobs and ovaries.

25:02.084 --> 25:05.379
Wow. You had the surgery.

25:05.421 --> 25:07.047
A month ago.

25:07.089 --> 25:09.133
Here to see my doctor
for a follow-up.

25:09.175 --> 25:11.344
That's great.
You knew what you wanted,

25:11.385 --> 25:12.719
you made a decision and...

25:12.761 --> 25:15.348
it must be a huge relief.
Actually,

25:15.389 --> 25:17.266
it was the scariest thing
I've ever done.

25:17.308 --> 25:18.725
It hurts, I have scars,

25:18.767 --> 25:21.561
and I have to take pills
for rest of my life.

25:21.603 --> 25:22.938
Erin, you're not

25:22.980 --> 25:24.773
just afraid of
becoming a parent.

25:24.815 --> 25:26.900
Your entire body
is about to change...

25:26.942 --> 25:29.362
but you will be alive,

25:29.403 --> 25:32.031
and you won't go to bed
worrying about cancer.

25:32.072 --> 25:35.117
That's one fear
you can conquer.

25:36.785 --> 25:39.121
I'm going to be late
for a checkup.
Yeah.

25:39.163 --> 25:40.747
It was great seeing you, Erin.

25:40.789 --> 25:43.417
It's great to see you, too.

25:43.459 --> 25:45.711
(sighs)

25:56.055 --> 25:58.432
(wry laugh)

25:58.474 --> 25:59.892
So let me guess.

25:59.933 --> 26:03.270
Uh, Annie called you
to talk me off the ledge,

26:03.312 --> 26:05.231
or maybe take me
back to therapy.

26:05.272 --> 26:07.565
Not everything's
about you, Dixon.

26:07.607 --> 26:09.985
It just so happens that today,
gimps ride for free

26:10.027 --> 26:11.695
on the Ferris wheel, so...

26:11.737 --> 26:13.531
Hey, if you
want to talk...

26:13.571 --> 26:16.158
I don't.
Why?

26:16.200 --> 26:17.826
Ah, because your story's
so uniquely sad

26:17.868 --> 26:20.162
that we're both gonna weep?

26:21.288 --> 26:24.208
Come on, dude.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.335
I can handle it, if you can.

26:30.506 --> 26:33.467
When I thought I was in this
chair for no good reason,

26:33.509 --> 26:35.677
I was like, what's the point
of even trying

26:35.719 --> 26:37.637
when some random loser
with a semitruck

26:37.679 --> 26:39.348
could take it all away,
you know?

26:39.390 --> 26:40.598
Yeah, that's a good attitude.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.476
Yeah, well, at least
I had somebody to blame.

26:42.518 --> 26:45.479
But today, a girl came in
talking about her dad,

26:45.521 --> 26:47.273
and I realized that her dad...

26:47.314 --> 26:50.526
is the random trucker.

26:50.568 --> 26:53.237
I just wanted to scream
at her, and be like,

26:53.279 --> 26:55.822
"Your dad ruined my life!"

26:55.864 --> 26:57.783
But I can't...
'cause he was just a guy

26:57.824 --> 27:01.161
who was trying to look out
for the people he loves.

27:03.080 --> 27:04.831
If it's not somebody else's
fault that I'm in this chair,

27:04.873 --> 27:06.083
man, then whose is it?

27:06.125 --> 27:08.294
It's yours.

27:08.335 --> 27:10.129
What?
Weren't you in a hurry

27:10.170 --> 27:12.214
to get to this exact pier
to make up with your girlfriend?

27:12.256 --> 27:14.592
Which, that's your fault, by the
way, too. God, you're a menace.

27:14.632 --> 27:16.260
Please don't.
Don't what?

27:16.302 --> 27:18.512
Don't take away your right
to be a victim?

27:18.554 --> 27:20.556
Point out how pathetic
you're being right now?

27:20.598 --> 27:22.640
Riley, I swear,
I will mess you up.

27:22.682 --> 27:23.809
Try it.

27:23.850 --> 27:25.519
Try. Get out of that chair
right now and punch me.

27:25.561 --> 27:27.020
At least you can.

27:27.062 --> 27:30.149
Well, maybe I will.
Okay. Do it then.
Come on, Dixon.

27:30.190 --> 27:31.525
Punch me.
Get out of the chair

27:31.567 --> 27:32.650
and punch me.
Bring it.

27:32.692 --> 27:35.279
I'm right here.
Come on. There you go.

27:35.321 --> 27:36.614
There you go.

27:36.654 --> 27:39.492
Look at that.

27:39.533 --> 27:41.785
Looks like I'm right again, huh?

27:41.827 --> 27:44.704
Dixon, it was an
accident, okay?

27:44.746 --> 27:46.790
It doesn't matter
who was at fault.

27:46.832 --> 27:49.585
What matters is what you do
from this moment forward.

27:49.627 --> 27:52.630
Only person that's keeping you
in this chair right now is you.

28:05.392 --> 28:07.269
I'll see you around.

28:17.613 --> 28:19.198
ANNOUNCER:
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

28:19.239 --> 28:22.700
that is your West Bev surf team
class of 2013.

28:22.742 --> 28:24.828
Whoo! Now...

28:24.870 --> 28:27.705
for the final event,
the Alumni Surf.

28:27.747 --> 28:30.000
Let's hear it
for them, people.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.419
(applause)

28:35.839 --> 28:37.883
I still can't believe
you lost Dixon.

28:37.924 --> 28:39.593
That's funny coming
from the girl

28:39.635 --> 28:41.970
whose list nearly
killed Silver.

28:42.012 --> 28:44.056
I was trying to help
a friend get pregnant.

28:44.097 --> 28:45.140
On a trapeze?

28:45.182 --> 28:48.143
This is a really weird
conversation.

28:48.185 --> 28:50.229
Look at them.

28:50.270 --> 28:51.397
We were them
two years ago.

28:51.438 --> 28:54.066
SILVER:
All happy, and
healthy, and...

28:54.107 --> 28:56.569
hopeful, and not afraid
of anything.

28:56.610 --> 28:58.278
And the worst thing that
could happens was

28:58.320 --> 29:01.114
you making out with the
wrong guy at prom.

29:02.199 --> 29:04.368
Okay, Alec kissed me.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.078
Oh, my God.

29:06.119 --> 29:07.079
When?

29:07.120 --> 29:08.080
On our friend date.

29:08.121 --> 29:09.289
ADRIANNA:
How was it?

29:09.331 --> 29:10.874
Alec's hot.

29:10.916 --> 29:12.501
I mean...

29:12.543 --> 29:13.919
not that it makes it okay.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.087
What exactly happened?

29:15.128 --> 29:16.714
We were having a
wonderful day out.

29:16.755 --> 29:19.508
I mean, he was his usual
ass self, at first,

29:19.550 --> 29:22.135
but then I took him yachting,
and then we had lunch,

29:22.177 --> 29:23.512
and he won me a silver unicorn,

29:23.554 --> 29:25.847
and the moment was perfect,
and then all of a sudden

29:25.889 --> 29:27.224
he kissed me.

29:27.266 --> 29:29.101
I've been trying to pretend
like it didn't happen.

29:29.142 --> 29:30.561
Okay, well,
you have to tell Max.

29:30.603 --> 29:31.978
NAOMI:
Tell him what?

29:32.020 --> 29:34.481
That I tricked his best friend
into spending the day with me,

29:34.523 --> 29:38.068
forced him to like me,
and then, oops, we kissed.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.070
With my track record
with Austin and now this,

29:40.112 --> 29:41.739
Max is never
gonna trust me again.

29:41.780 --> 29:42.781
You know,

29:42.822 --> 29:45.951
Max will understand,
but you have to tell him.

29:45.992 --> 29:49.079
If you don't tell Max,
and then he somehow finds out,

29:49.121 --> 29:51.790
then your relationship
will be ruined.

29:59.757 --> 30:01.925
Yo.

30:01.967 --> 30:03.594
Dixon, dude.

30:03.636 --> 30:05.971
Annie practically put out
an AMBER Alert for you.

30:06.012 --> 30:07.389
Uh, yeah, I heard.

30:07.431 --> 30:10.392
Um, yeah, why aren't you
surfing with the alumni?

30:10.434 --> 30:11.893
Uh, I got a lot on my mind.

30:11.935 --> 30:14.730
I figured I'd take a drive up
the coast and clear my head.

30:14.772 --> 30:15.773
I hear you, man.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.776
This accident stuff
is eating me up inside.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.193
I'm just staring to realize

30:20.235 --> 30:21.654
that I can't let
that one moment

30:21.695 --> 30:23.781
hang over my head
for the rest of my life.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.449
Yeah.

30:25.491 --> 30:28.076
Well, hey, now that I know
you're all right,

30:28.118 --> 30:29.662
I'll see you later.

30:29.703 --> 30:31.538
Yeah. Uh, wait, wait, wait.

30:31.580 --> 30:33.415
Before you go...

30:33.457 --> 30:35.959

Hey, Annie.

30:37.919 --> 30:40.756
Oh, my God, Riley.
Did you find Dixon?

30:40.798 --> 30:43.133
Yeah, yeah, we had
a pleasant little chat.

30:43.175 --> 30:44.259
He's not back yet?

30:44.301 --> 30:46.428
No, he's still not
answering his phone.

30:47.513 --> 30:50.098
What exactly did you say?

30:50.140 --> 30:51.308
Just that he was
a pathetic loser

30:51.350 --> 30:52.810
and it was his fault
that he couldn't walk.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.478
(sighs)
What?

30:54.520 --> 30:56.062
It usually works.

30:56.104 --> 30:57.189
Ah, see?

31:02.361 --> 31:05.781
Yeah, yeah, um...

fertility clinic in the morning.

Oh. See? All you had to do
was overcome your fear.

Looks like you did know

33:56.785 --> 33:58.829
Dixon's going through
a lot of the same things

33:58.871 --> 34:01.498
I went through after my own
accident a few years ago.

34:01.540 --> 34:05.168
I can't imagine what it was like
serving in Afghanistan.

34:05.210 --> 34:08.588

34:08.630 --> 34:11.341
I was never in the military.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.467
I got offered a ton of money

34:13.510 --> 34:15.971
to work over there
as a private contractor.

34:17.556 --> 34:19.098
Then one night...

34:19.139 --> 34:22.978
after I delivered some supplies
into town, I...

34:23.020 --> 34:26.565
I got drunk, decided I was gonna
race somebody back to camp.

34:26.606 --> 34:28.440

34:28.483 --> 34:31.069
Flipped my truck,

34:39.159 --> 34:44.541

I was just there for a paycheck.

34:44.583 --> 34:48.085
Actually, I was... I was trying
to save up money for my wedding.

34:48.127 --> 34:50.714
You're married?
No. After
the accident,

34:50.755 --> 34:52.382
my fiancée left me.

36:44.703 --> 36:47.330
I didn't say anything

36:47.372 --> 36:50.583

have her out of my life.

We know.

36:53.712 --> 36:55.172
You do?

36:55.213 --> 36:56.923
We were on her
for bank fraud,

36:56.965 --> 37:00.468
but what you said about
her hitting you with the
car got me thinking.

37:00.510 --> 37:03.262
Did a little digging and
found a whole lot more.

37:06.016 --> 37:07.392
This girl is

37:07.433 --> 37:10.269
a master con artist--
she's been at least

37:10.311 --> 37:12.605
five different people
in the last five years.

37:12.647 --> 37:15.233
Vanessa Shaw's not even
her real name.

37:15.274 --> 37:18.528
Technically, your fiancée
and business partner
doesn't even exist.

37:19.487 --> 37:21.740
So...

37:21.781 --> 37:24.159
she's really gone.
The FBI

37:24.201 --> 37:26.161
took over the case.
If her previous pattern

37:26.203 --> 37:28.663
was any indication
she's probably fled the state,

37:28.705 --> 37:29.956
maybe even the country.

37:29.998 --> 37:32.834
I'd be surprised
if any of us saw her again.
