We'll leave you two

We're very sorry
for your loss.

Wait.

to see my daughter's body.

[ sighing ] oh.
Mr. Brand,
I don't think you understand.

19:34.107 --> 19:36.340
Your daughter
is at the morgue,

19:36.342 --> 19:39.043
And that is not a place
that you want to be right now.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.611
I promise you.

19:40.613 --> 19:45.016
I have the right to see her body
as a parent, don't I?

20:03.402 --> 20:06.737
Jack: I think that transgender
kid was brave as hell.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.806
It took a lot of guts
to live in the open like that,

20:08.808 --> 20:12.043
And her father deserves credit
for having supported her.

20:12.045 --> 20:13.711
Her father
gave her dresses.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.880
He might as well have put
a target on the back

20:15.882 --> 20:17.415
That said, "beat me."

20:17.417 --> 20:19.584
She asked for those dresses,
and I still say brave kid.

20:19.586 --> 20:22.019
Besides,
it could be just as dangerous

20:22.021 --> 20:24.422
Pretending to be
somebody you're not.

20:48.214 --> 20:51.082
Sharon, could that young lady
have hidden her identity?

20:51.084 --> 20:52.717
From what I read,

20:52.719 --> 20:56.354
Gender identity dysphoria
in children is not a choice.

20:56.356 --> 20:57.855
Hmm.
Pancakes?

20:57.857 --> 21:00.391
Oh, um, yes, thank you.
She only wants one.

We both missed it
in 9th grade,

it's making her emotional.

We're just hanging out.

hustling men on the street.

21:39.832 --> 21:41.132
Is he not gay?

21:41.134 --> 21:42.833
He hasn't told me
anything about that,

21:42.835 --> 21:44.635
And I am not asking.

21:44.637 --> 21:45.970
Maybe he's confused.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.805
I could help him
sort out his priorities.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.174
Listen, I only told you about
the    <i>abu</i>that he went through

21:50.176 --> 21:53.010
So that <i>you</i> could be
sensitive to his issues,

21:53.012 --> 21:56.013
Not so that you could push him
in one direction or the other.

21:56.015 --> 21:57.481
I never push people.
You spent virtually no time

21:59.819 --> 22:02.119

Look, I am brutally aware that
I am not a good parent, sharon,

to remind me every five minutes.

22:08.928 --> 22:10.695
Oh, it is.

22:10.697 --> 22:16.167
Well, maybe I'm interested
in the kid because you are.

develop the same interest

22:18.338 --> 22:20.004

There was no wreck on the 101,

there had been,

22:33.319 --> 22:34.552

mr. Brand's office,

22:34.554 --> 22:36.153

the whole afternoon off.

22:36.155 --> 22:37.988
So, why'd he lie?

22:37.990 --> 22:39.457

He moved money out of

30:26.424 --> 30:27.825
Kris?

30:27.827 --> 30:31.695
Kris, this is
the always-creepy emma rios.

30:31.697 --> 30:33.664
Creepy emma, kris.

30:33.666 --> 30:35.432
Hi.
She's the prosecutor

30:35.434 --> 30:38.502
In that murder trial
I'm supposed to testify in --

30:38.504 --> 30:40.604
The one who's basically
wrecking my life.

30:40.606 --> 30:42.206
You were doing a good job of
that before I ever showed up.

30:42.208 --> 30:43.640
Rusty.
Jack.

30:43.642 --> 30:45.943
Emma, I believe
the captain is expecting us.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.549
And that lady's the reason why
I can't go with you

30:52.551 --> 30:54.284
To see
"shakespeare in love,"

30:54.286 --> 30:56.320
Unless you want to hang with
the really popular kid

30:56.322 --> 30:58.121
Who brings a police escort
to the movies.

30:58.123 --> 30:59.690
I'm sure the potheads
would love that.

30:59.692 --> 31:02.392
All right. Time to study.
This way.

31:02.394 --> 31:06.396
And it doesn't help anything
to call emma "creepy."

31:06.398 --> 31:07.998
Aw, poor little kris.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.234
"love looks not with the eyes
but with the mind,

31:10.236 --> 31:13.470
And therefore is
wing'd cupid painted blind."

31:13.472 --> 31:15.038
Sir?

31:15.040 --> 31:18.242
You're weird.
I am, indeed, detective,

31:18.244 --> 31:20.744
And thus,
I take my leave of you.

31:20.746 --> 31:23.714
Emma: There's nothing unique
about that shovel.

31:23.716 --> 31:25.048
Provenza: I'll tell you
what's unique about it --

31:25.050 --> 31:27.317
Her prints
are all over it.

31:27.319 --> 31:28.485
Is that unique enough?
You can buy a shovel like that
at any hardware store --

31:28.487 --> 31:30.320
That's what
her lawyer will say.

31:30.322 --> 31:31.555
Well, what will her lawyer say
about the dirt from the grave

31:31.557 --> 31:32.756
That's on the shovel,
on her shoes?

31:32.758 --> 31:34.091
He'll say
what you already know --

31:34.093 --> 31:35.759
That you can't prove
when the dirt got there,

31:35.761 --> 31:38.095
And he'll go out and prove
that the dirt does not have

31:38.097 --> 31:40.063
The unique qualities we need,
and it won't.

31:40.065 --> 31:41.498
Couldn't you have waited
a little longer until she --

31:41.500 --> 31:43.433
No.
We pushed her to lawyer up.

31:43.435 --> 31:45.335
Now, here we are.
Let's review.

31:45.337 --> 31:46.536
Right.

31:46.538 --> 31:48.505
Her daughter's body
was buried

31:48.507 --> 31:51.341
In the same position
that the kid probably slept in.

31:51.343 --> 31:53.043
No, no,
don't you dare turn away.

31:53.045 --> 31:55.045
Now, you want this case,
you grow up,

31:55.047 --> 31:58.081
And you look at these pictures
side by side.

32:06.291 --> 32:08.425
You know they'll
put the victim on trial --

32:08.427 --> 32:12.462
The girl in the boy's body,
the gender bender, the misfit --

32:12.464 --> 32:14.798
How much trouble she was
to her mom.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.266
Where's hobbs?

32:16.268 --> 32:17.467
Captain, for the love of god,
call hobbs.

32:17.469 --> 32:19.269
It only takes one vote,
one juror,

32:19.271 --> 32:21.705
To ruin the entire case.

32:21.707 --> 32:26.276
I'd like a prosecutor
who isn't afraid of
losing in a good cause.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.111
Emma...

32:28.113 --> 32:33.550
Emma, y-you think I understand
boys who think they're girls?

32:34.986 --> 32:38.789
I'm just as much at sea
as your jurors will be,

32:38.791 --> 32:43.293
But I know when a kid has
had his head bashed in.

32:43.295 --> 32:46.997
Now, capt-- captain, are --
are you even listening to me?

32:46.999 --> 32:49.333
Mm.
What are you looking at?

32:49.335 --> 32:50.767
Phone records.

32:50.769 --> 32:53.236
Phone records?
What about phone records?

32:55.506 --> 32:57.240
Kids don't call.
They text.

32:57.242 --> 32:59.643
The only person that rusty calls
on his cellphone is me.

32:59.645 --> 33:05.515
Kris, he texts.
And?

33:05.517 --> 33:08.018
I promise you,
mr. Brand,

33:08.020 --> 33:10.988
We can prove
beyond a shadow of a doubt

33:10.990 --> 33:12.756
That your wife
buried your daughter.

33:12.758 --> 33:14.791
I don't believe it.

33:14.793 --> 33:17.027
My wife could never,
ever murder her own child.

33:17.029 --> 33:18.195
It's impossible.

33:18.197 --> 33:19.629
Yeah,
mom didn't kill michelle.

33:19.631 --> 33:21.131
We all loved michelle.

33:21.133 --> 33:24.968
Is that why you keep
calling her cellphone, matt,

33:24.970 --> 33:26.203
Even though
you know she's dead?

33:26.205 --> 33:27.637
Provenza:
But you didn't call her --

33:27.639 --> 33:29.106
Not a single time --

33:29.108 --> 33:30.974
The entire month
before she died.

33:30.976 --> 33:33.944
You texted each other a lot,
but you never called.

33:33.946 --> 33:35.812
Until night before last,

33:35.814 --> 33:40.617
When you dialed your sister's
number over 100 times in a row,

33:40.619 --> 33:42.686
Before you supposedly knew
she was missing.

33:42.688 --> 33:43.854
Why?

33:43.856 --> 33:45.789
I think I know why.

33:45.791 --> 33:48.658
Your mother was in the park,
looking for michelle's body,

33:48.660 --> 33:52.696
Hunting for where you left it,
by following the ringtone.

33:52.698 --> 33:53.864
Is that
how it happened?

33:53.866 --> 33:55.766
What are you saying?
Mr. Brand.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.335
[ dial tone, dialing ]

33:58.337 --> 34:00.070
And yesterday and today,
you've gone on calling

34:00.072 --> 34:01.638
Because you miss
the sound of her voice.

34:01.640 --> 34:02.672
Is that it?

34:02.674 --> 34:04.074
Michelle:
<i>Hey, everybody,</i>

34:04.076 --> 34:05.175
<i>If you're</i>
<i>talking to this phone,</i>

34:05.177 --> 34:06.877
<i>You must be somebody I love.</i>

34:06.879 --> 34:08.145
<i>If you love me back,</i>
<i>leave me a lovely message.</i>

34:08.147 --> 34:09.413
<i>Bye.</i>
<i>[</i>  <i>beep</i>]

34:09.415 --> 34:11.214
[ inhales deeply ]

34:11.216 --> 34:13.650
Matt, you want to tell us
what happened now,

34:13.652 --> 34:15.719
Or do you want your mother
to sit in jail

34:15.721 --> 34:17.320
For the rest of her life?

34:17.322 --> 34:19.890
What reason would my wife have
for killing our daughter?

34:19.892 --> 34:21.258
[ voice breaking ]
maybe because

34:21.260 --> 34:22.726
You and michelle
were leaving us.

34:22.728 --> 34:25.862
Maybe because mom
didn't want you to move out.

34:25.864 --> 34:27.664
No, no.

34:27.666 --> 34:31.501
Your mother didn't even
know about that.

34:33.404 --> 34:36.573
Oh, my god.

34:36.575 --> 34:37.874
Matthew?

34:37.876 --> 34:39.509
Sharon:
Michelle called the house.

34:39.511 --> 34:42.179
Your mom was making dinner,
and you got into the car,

34:42.181 --> 34:44.881
And    <i>y</i>went to the mall
to pick her up.

34:44.883 --> 34:46.917
What have you done?

34:46.919 --> 34:49.853
Yeah, I picked her up.

34:55.026 --> 34:56.193
Dad and I
are moving to santa monica.

34:56.195 --> 34:57.461
Matt:
She told me all about

34:57.463 --> 34:58.895
Your little apartment
in santa monica.

34:58.897 --> 35:00.464
It's true. We're moving,

35:00.466 --> 35:02.432
And I'm gonna start
at santa monica high school.

35:02.434 --> 35:03.633
The kids there
are so cool.

35:03.635 --> 35:05.702
She was all happy.

35:05.704 --> 35:08.438
She was excited
about tearing our family apart.

35:08.440 --> 35:12.042
Dad's moving out?
Are they getting a divorce?

35:12.044 --> 35:13.577
That's why she wanted
to go to the mall.

35:13.579 --> 35:15.112
She wanted to say goodbye
to her friends.

35:15.114 --> 35:17.114
I don't know. I mean,
who cares if they get a divorce?

35:17.116 --> 35:19.816
She said, "I don't care
if they get a divorce."

35:19.818 --> 35:22.252
We weren't divorcing.
She was just changing schools!

35:22.254 --> 35:24.087
She was destroying
everything!

35:24.089 --> 35:25.789
I'm supposed to
lose my family

35:25.791 --> 35:27.924
Because
she wants hormone shots?

35:27.926 --> 35:29.593
Matt.
Everything --

35:29.595 --> 35:34.664
Everything has always, always,
always been about her.

35:34.666 --> 35:37.501
It's been like
living in an insane asylum

35:37.503 --> 35:39.269
From the moment
she was born.

35:39.271 --> 35:40.837
So you put a stop to it.

35:40.839 --> 35:43.406
I mean, if you had seen
the expression on her face

35:43.408 --> 35:45.308
When she told me
that you two were leaving.

35:45.310 --> 35:47.477
God, why is everything
always about you?

35:47.479 --> 35:49.813
Why can't you
be happy for me?
She thought
I'd be happy for her.

35:49.815 --> 35:52.582
That's how crazy selfish
she was.

35:52.584 --> 35:54.451
All those years
explaining her,

35:54.453 --> 35:56.953
Protecting her,
and I'd had it.

35:56.955 --> 35:58.021
Just let me out.

35:59.624 --> 36:01.758
I pulled the car over,
and she got out...

36:07.098 --> 36:10.667
...And ran toward the park.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.669
I chased her.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.771
With a bat?
With a bat.

36:30.688 --> 36:31.955
I hit her with it.

36:34.725 --> 36:35.792
And then
after you killed her?

36:35.794 --> 36:37.727
I wasn't trying to do that.

36:37.729 --> 36:39.696
Oh, yes, you were.

36:39.698 --> 36:42.232
You hit her in the head
three times.

36:42.234 --> 36:44.467
You <i>did</i> mean it.

36:44.469 --> 36:46.336
And then you went home
and you told your mom.

36:46.338 --> 36:48.238
Sykes: And she went out
and buried michelle.

36:48.240 --> 36:50.140
And took the battery
from her phone.

36:50.142 --> 36:52.709
Hoping we wouldn't find her --
hoping to protect you.

36:52.711 --> 36:55.378
Well, maybe -- maybe --
maybe she thought

36:55.380 --> 36:58.148
That we could just go back
to being a regular family again.

36:58.150 --> 37:00.550
[ sighs ]

37:00.552 --> 37:02.485
[ voice breaking ] you chased
your little sister down,

37:02.487 --> 37:05.255
And you beat her to death
with a bat?

37:05.257 --> 37:07.824
Yeah, I chased her.

37:10.027 --> 37:12.362
And you know what,
dad?

37:12.364 --> 37:15.165
What?

37:15.167 --> 37:19.669
She didn't run
like a girl.

37:26.510 --> 37:30.547
Okay, matt.

37:30.549 --> 37:33.717
We've already
arrested your mother,

37:33.719 --> 37:35.685
And to let her go --
and so she can't continue

37:35.687 --> 37:37.520
To act as if she's the one
who did this --

37:37.522 --> 37:42.192
I need you to tell me...

37:42.194 --> 37:44.027
Where'd you put the bat?

38:14.759 --> 38:17.861
Just one more thing
to do.

38:32.009 --> 38:34.411
I didn't murder her.
[ sighs ]

38:34.413 --> 38:37.681
No.
You murdered her family.

38:37.683 --> 38:39.449
You made it your mission

38:39.451 --> 38:42.018
To make this kid
feel like a monster,

38:42.020 --> 38:43.486
But you're the monster.

38:43.488 --> 38:46.289
And do you know what we do
to monsters, lewis?

38:46.291 --> 38:47.924
Kill them
with a pitchfork?

38:47.926 --> 38:51.194
That would be great,
but as it is,

38:51.196 --> 38:52.662
We can only lock them up
in jail,

38:52.664 --> 38:54.097
Which is where you're going
till you turn 18.

38:54.099 --> 38:55.332
What the hell
are you talking about?

38:55.334 --> 38:56.933
I didn't do anything
to this freak.

38:56.935 --> 38:58.501
Not true.

38:58.503 --> 39:01.037
These pictures prove that
you committed sexual battery,

39:01.039 --> 39:02.939
Which is good enough
to put you away in juvie.

What? You can't.
You can't -- you can't do that.
