WEBVTT

00:04.872 --> 00:06.507
What's with all
the trucks in
the street?

00:06.574 --> 00:07.941
Did the Rutledges
rent out their house

00:08.008 --> 00:09.277
for another
commercial shoot?

00:09.343 --> 00:11.112
Yeah. Apparently,
it's a big one...

00:11.179 --> 00:14.382
Tampax.
(GROANS)

00:14.448 --> 00:16.950
Right here in our
own neighborhood?
Gross.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.420
Well, Barb called
and said the port-a-potties
will be gone

00:19.487 --> 00:20.488
in a couple of days.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.190
I love those things.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.625
They take hand-washing
out of the equation.

00:26.127 --> 00:27.395
Dave, we've
been over this.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.463
Stay out of those
plastic crap shacks.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.333
So I can't use the
port-a-potties or pee
in the bushes,

00:32.400 --> 00:35.203
but you insist I play
outside an hour every day.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.071
You can't have it
both ways, people.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.442
How was your first
day at Freddy Dog?

00:41.509 --> 00:42.943
I can't believe
I ever thought

00:43.010 --> 00:45.713
I could work for that
soul-sucking corporation.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.315
Please don't tell
me you got fired.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.717
Great. I won't.
That was easier
than I thought.

00:49.783 --> 00:50.884
Stop.

00:50.951 --> 00:52.386
What did you do?

00:52.453 --> 00:54.122
It depends on whose
version you hear.

00:54.188 --> 00:55.323
What's your version?

00:55.389 --> 00:57.391
I was conscientious
and did a great job.

00:57.458 --> 00:58.626
What's their version?

00:58.692 --> 00:59.727
I stole from
the register.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.829
What?
But it isn't true.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.365
I took an advance on my salary
to buy some nail polish

01:04.432 --> 01:08.169
so my hands would look
better serving their
gross meat sticks.

01:08.236 --> 01:09.903
I can't believe
you got fired.

01:09.970 --> 01:11.505
Parks don't get fired.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.907
If anything,
we fire people.

01:13.974 --> 01:16.110
Oh, really?
Did you fire
the gardener yet?

01:16.177 --> 01:18.346
He's a good guy.
He deserves a second chance.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.781
He doesn't own
a lawnmower.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.284
(SIGHS)

01:23.351 --> 01:25.253
Look, Mol,
when you have a job,

01:25.319 --> 01:27.755
you have to think about
what's best for the business,
not yourself...

01:27.821 --> 01:29.457
Or your fingernails.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.492
Although, good color.
Candy apple?

01:31.559 --> 01:32.860
Ruby slippers.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.062
Okay, all right,
all right.

01:35.129 --> 01:36.697
Well, you better find
another job, missy,

01:36.764 --> 01:39.733
because we're not paying
for your snowboarding trip.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.835
No employment,
no enjoyment.

01:41.902 --> 01:44.004
That's right, Mol.
Get another job,

01:44.071 --> 01:47.341
or snowboarding
turns into no-boarding.

01:47.408 --> 01:48.609
Oof-baboof.

01:48.676 --> 01:49.810
"No-boarding?"

01:49.877 --> 01:51.945
Turd in the pool.
Super-forced, Al.

01:53.647 --> 01:54.915
(GROANS)

01:59.553 --> 02:01.255
I just
talked to Barb.

02:01.322 --> 02:02.423
She and Andy can't get
in their kitchen

02:02.490 --> 02:03.724
because of the
commercial shoot,

02:03.791 --> 02:06.093
so I invited them over
for dinner tomorrow.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.396
No!
Andy's so annoying!

02:08.462 --> 02:10.030
He's always saying
we should hang out

02:10.097 --> 02:11.365
and giving me
tips on my lawn

02:11.432 --> 02:13.033
and compliments
on my weekend wear.

02:13.100 --> 02:15.669
Shut up, Andy.
I know my Henley is sick.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.408
Oh, we have to renew
our life insurance.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.376
They need the records from
your last annual check-up.

02:22.443 --> 02:25.546
Okay. I'll just write
something up and send it in.

02:25.613 --> 02:27.648
You know you can't
do it yourself.

02:27.715 --> 02:29.183
Oh, yeah, I meant I will

02:29.250 --> 02:31.619
have the doctor who gave me
the exam write something up.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.121
Well, who's the doctor?
I can't tell you that.

02:34.188 --> 02:36.690
It's doctor-patient
confidentiality.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.792
All right, what's going on?
Why are you being weird?

02:38.859 --> 02:40.127
Okay, you know
what's weird?

02:40.194 --> 02:41.462
You're asking me
all these questions

02:41.529 --> 02:44.865
when we're dangerously
low on shower gel.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.434
Now you're
changing the subject.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.068
You only do that when
you're hiding something.

02:48.135 --> 02:49.637
No, I don't!
Mmm-hmm.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.805
You know what was sad?
When your grandma died.

02:54.074 --> 02:57.144
Ken, when did you
get your last physical?

02:57.211 --> 02:58.346
(SCOFFS)

02:58.412 --> 03:01.048
Fine, look, I don't
recall the exact date,

03:01.114 --> 03:02.683
but I remember
it took forever to get home

03:02.750 --> 03:06.720
because OJ.'s bronco
was clogging up the 405.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.390
So every year, when you
told me you got a physical,

03:09.457 --> 03:10.758
you were lying?

03:10.824 --> 03:12.693
Oh, good.
Go ahead.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.263
Spin it
any way you want.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.097
I need you
to take care of yourself.

03:17.164 --> 03:18.999
I don't want to raise
our kids without you.

03:19.066 --> 03:21.835
Let's face it, it's no picnic
raising them with you.

03:21.902 --> 03:24.672
I'm a doctor.
I would know if something
was wrong with me.

03:24.738 --> 03:27.375
You're getting a physical
first thing tomorrow.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.009
Look, but I'm healthy.
I mean...
(GIGGLING)

03:29.076 --> 03:31.044
Look, I don't need one.
Why can't you believe me?

03:31.111 --> 03:33.013
I don't know.
Maybe because for 20 years,

03:33.080 --> 03:35.316
you've been lying
about getting physicals?

03:35.383 --> 03:37.285
And you never
let me forget it!

03:37.351 --> 03:38.586
You just told me.

03:38.652 --> 03:41.989
And have we talked about
anything else ever since?

03:42.055 --> 03:43.724
Nice try, but you
don't have a choice.

03:43.791 --> 03:45.259
You're going
to a doctor.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.760
We're in this
together, ken.

03:46.827 --> 03:49.162
That body of yours
belongs to both of us.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.666
Okay! (LAUGHS)

03:57.305 --> 03:59.307
Bow-chicka-bow!

04:00.541 --> 04:01.775
What are you doing?

04:03.210 --> 04:04.812
Okay, I think
I may have misread,

04:04.878 --> 04:06.280
"That body belongs
to both of us."

04:11.619 --> 04:13.321
PAT: Good morning,
everyone!

04:13.387 --> 04:15.423
I'm speaking loudly
so you can all hear me

04:15.489 --> 04:17.725
over the vast gap
in our status.

04:19.727 --> 04:21.629
I have some
exciting news.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.230
To cut back on
the number of stolen scrubs,

04:23.297 --> 04:25.766
we're installing a machine
to dispense them.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.370
Every morning,
you'll each get a code

04:29.437 --> 04:31.372
to punch into the machine
to get your scrubs.

04:31.439 --> 04:34.207
What? So now we have
to get our clothes out of
a vending machine?

04:34.274 --> 04:36.810
This is what happens
when you jackals take
the scrubs home

04:36.877 --> 04:38.879
to use as
sweats or pajamas

04:38.946 --> 04:41.749
or for role-playing games
with your spouses.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.017
That was you, Pat.

04:44.084 --> 04:45.819
Ken!

04:45.886 --> 04:47.888
Does the phrase, "I'm gonna
tell you a filthy sex story,

04:47.955 --> 04:50.090
"but keep it to yourself"
mean nothing to you?

04:51.859 --> 04:53.527
Hey, Julie.
I need a favor,

04:53.594 --> 04:54.862
doctor to doctor.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.930
Again? Fine.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.300
Iced venti
non-fat chai?

05:00.368 --> 05:02.670
No, I'm... I'm not asking you
to make another coffee run.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.805
I need a medical favor.
Really?

05:04.872 --> 05:06.239
Yeah, I have to
have a physical.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.741
Dr. Park,

05:07.808 --> 05:11.679
I would be honored
to serve as your
personal physician.

05:11.745 --> 05:14.515
Honestly, I was starting
to worry that you didn't
respect me as a doctor.

05:14.582 --> 05:15.916
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
just sign this.

05:17.551 --> 05:18.986
But what
about your physical?

05:19.052 --> 05:21.455
No, I don't need
an actual exam.
I'm in perfect health.

05:21.522 --> 05:22.956
You know,
check this.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.625
(HUMMING)

05:26.960 --> 05:28.696
Boom!

05:28.762 --> 05:30.864
Not even winded and only
slightly pulled my groin.
(CHUCKLES)

05:32.065 --> 05:33.734
Anyway, ink
that baby up.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.636
Allison's on my
jock about this.

05:36.937 --> 05:38.806
You know what? No.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.808
Dr. Julie Dobbs
is a professional.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.342
Why are you
going third-person?

05:42.410 --> 05:46.113
Because Dr. Dobbs
goes third-person
when she's nervous.

05:47.481 --> 05:48.849
And she's not signing
a darn thing

05:48.916 --> 05:51.452
until she gives you a complete
and thorough physical.

05:51.519 --> 05:52.720
So you come
here tomorrow

05:52.786 --> 05:55.456
ready to give her
the respect she deserves.

05:55.523 --> 05:58.091
Oh, and a
full cup of urine.

06:04.432 --> 06:06.967
Okay, there has been
a horrible mistake!

06:07.568 --> 06:08.836
(ALL LAUGHING)

06:10.904 --> 06:13.507
That's...that's
a real good look on you.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.409
(LAUGHS)

06:15.476 --> 06:16.777
It's not funny!

06:16.844 --> 06:19.580
Pat's stupid vending
machine has it out for me!

06:19.647 --> 06:20.948
I punched in my code,

06:21.014 --> 06:23.784
and out came the outfit from
Jared's "before" picture.

06:26.253 --> 06:28.055
You know,
before everything.

06:28.121 --> 06:29.356
(LAUGHS)

06:30.824 --> 06:33.126
Oh, those scrubs
are too big.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.528
(CONTINUES LAUGHING)

06:35.362 --> 06:36.464
You think?

06:39.900 --> 06:41.234
That would
actually look cute

06:41.301 --> 06:44.271
if you belted it
and bloused it over.

06:44.337 --> 06:46.273
It would
look adorable.

06:46.339 --> 06:49.342
What it would not
look is professional.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.911
Oh. Oh, Clark.

06:50.978 --> 06:52.480
Clark, I got you.

06:52.546 --> 06:55.048
I gave you the wrong
code on purpose, dude.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.284
(LAUGHS)

06:57.350 --> 06:59.419
What? Why?
What's funny about that?

06:59.487 --> 07:01.421
Oh, come on.

07:02.389 --> 07:03.991
Here's your actual code.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.258
Is this actually my code,

07:05.325 --> 07:07.427
or is this one gonna give
me super-tiny scrubs?

07:09.630 --> 07:11.565
Aw, come on.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.402
Here's your
actual code.

07:26.480 --> 07:29.182
Good morning,
Dr. Park.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.521
Now, I know
we're colleagues,

07:33.587 --> 07:36.123
but today I am the physician
and you are the patient,

07:36.189 --> 07:38.792
and I would appreciate it
if you treated me as such.

07:38.859 --> 07:39.960
Did you get my text?

07:42.563 --> 07:43.897
Iced venti chai.

07:48.736 --> 07:51.471
Anyway, I have the results
from your chemistry panel.

07:51.539 --> 07:52.606
Ah! Okay.

07:52.673 --> 07:55.442
Ldl, creatinine,
calcium all good.

07:55.509 --> 07:56.610
Ooh!

07:56.677 --> 07:59.012
Looks like I tested
positive for beefcake.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.050
Excuse you.

08:03.116 --> 08:06.119
I am administering
this exam.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.922
Okay, everything seems
to be where I'd like it...

08:08.989 --> 08:10.323
(SLURPING)

08:12.425 --> 08:14.194
Except your attitude.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.197
Fine, let's just
get this over with.

08:17.264 --> 08:19.399
But I'm not letting
you check my prostate.

08:19.466 --> 08:21.368
Um, it's part
of the physical.

08:21.434 --> 08:23.270
Um, it ain't
part of this one.

08:24.672 --> 08:25.839
(SIGHS)

08:25.906 --> 08:28.441
Dr. Park, you know
at your age, it's mandatory.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.310
So I'm going
to repeat to you

08:30.377 --> 08:33.080
what I hear you
tell dozens of
patients every day...

08:33.146 --> 08:35.048
"Don't be a freaking baby!"

08:38.586 --> 08:39.920
Would you feel
more comfortable

08:39.987 --> 08:41.622
if I had Clark
come in to observe?

08:41.689 --> 08:43.557
Well, why stop there?
Let's stream it live

08:43.624 --> 08:45.626
so my cousins in
San Jose can watch.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.661
They're always asking
me what I'm up to.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.599
I guess I could
call your wife

08:51.665 --> 08:53.701
and tell her
you're not cooperating.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.775
So, your
prostate's healthy.

09:04.344 --> 09:05.378
Huh.

09:05.445 --> 09:07.848
140/90.
That's a little high.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.282
Of course it's high.

09:09.349 --> 09:11.484
I just had a co-worker
treat me like a hand puppet.

09:13.186 --> 09:16.356
And your pulse
is 110 beats per minute.

09:16.423 --> 09:19.693
And your EKG
shows tachycardia with PVCs.

09:20.427 --> 09:21.929
Boop-boo.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.965
I'm sending you home
with a holter heart monitor
to wear overnight.

09:25.032 --> 09:27.367
What? No!
That's complete overkill!

09:27.434 --> 09:29.036
Just being thorough.

09:29.870 --> 09:32.139
(SCOFFS) Fine.

09:32.205 --> 09:35.408
I guess I should be
grateful you didn't put me
through a hernia exam.

09:35.475 --> 09:38.478
Oh! Thanks for
reminding me!

09:38.545 --> 09:41.081
You're such
a difficult patient,
I almost forgot.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.284
Look, I know you're
trying to be thorough,

09:44.351 --> 09:47.655
but those two stones
are staying unturned.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.322
Mmm.

09:49.389 --> 09:50.624
And this number here,

09:50.691 --> 09:52.860
this is your wife's
cell, correct?

09:56.630 --> 09:57.898
(COUGHS)

09:59.633 --> 10:01.034
Obee-kaybee.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.303
Perfectly healthy.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.706
Please don't look me
in the eyes just yet.

10:11.511 --> 10:13.213
Look what Julie
did to me.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.582
My heart rate
was slightly elevated,

10:15.649 --> 10:18.318
and now she's forcing me to
wear this monitor all night.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.821
My friend, Amir,
wore one of those to school,

10:20.888 --> 10:22.923
and the principal
called the SWAT Team.

10:24.892 --> 10:26.760
It's so constricting.

10:26.827 --> 10:30.263
I mean, what if I want to go
swimming or wear something
with a plunging neckline?

10:30.330 --> 10:31.865
You said
it was for one night.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.967
Tomorrow you can flaunt
all the cleavage you want.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.237
Have you seen what's
going on next door?

10:37.304 --> 10:38.571
The film crew
is on lunch,

10:38.638 --> 10:40.440
and the line
is past our driveway.

10:40.507 --> 10:44.577
They're serving
chicken parm...
Dee-lish.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.114
So, Dave, what did we
tell you about taking
food from strangers?

10:47.180 --> 10:48.315
Carlos isn't a stranger.

10:48.381 --> 10:50.217
I've known him
since breakfast.

10:50.283 --> 10:52.019
He calls me, Papi.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.724
So, how was
the new job?

10:56.790 --> 10:59.159
Eh, kind of, hard to
judge on one day.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.995
But seeing as there won't be
another day, it was not great.

11:02.863 --> 11:04.164
You got fired again?

11:04.231 --> 11:05.298
Come on!

11:05.365 --> 11:08.068
Cannons don't get fired
as much as you!

11:08.135 --> 11:10.704
Pottery doesn't get
fired as much as you!

11:10.771 --> 11:12.072
Cuban cigars,

11:12.139 --> 11:14.474
a crowd at a pep rally,
a furnace in Alaska...

11:14.541 --> 11:15.909
Ken, we get it.

11:16.710 --> 11:17.845
It wasn't my fault.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.780
It's a cart that
sells iPhone cases,

11:19.847 --> 11:22.716
and they put it at
the opposite end of the mall
from the Apple store.

11:22.783 --> 11:25.318
So I made an executive
decision and moved it.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.488
What did you hit?

11:28.555 --> 11:29.790
I derailed
a toddler train.

11:32.525 --> 11:36.163
In my defense, there was
just as much screaming
and crying before I hit it.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.467
You said, "Do what's
best for the business."

11:40.533 --> 11:43.270
Eh, just do what you're told
and make that money.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.305
Way to squash my
entrepreneurial spirit.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.742
I bet nobody ever
told Steve Jobs to,
"Just do what you're told."

11:48.809 --> 11:52.045
Hey, Steve Jobs had a daughter
he didn't even acknowledge.

11:52.112 --> 11:55.048
So, he was smart
in ways the rest of us
can only marvel at.

12:01.789 --> 12:03.156
Oh, watch this.

12:03.223 --> 12:06.226
Damona pranked me yesterday,
but I'm about to get her back.

12:06.293 --> 12:09.562
I ordered five pizzas
in her name.

12:09.629 --> 12:14.067
And the mortification of
Damona Watkins starts now.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.436
Uh, I got five pizzas
for a Damona Watkins.

12:16.503 --> 12:17.938
I didn't order
any pizza.

12:18.005 --> 12:20.573
I have your name
and this address.

12:20.640 --> 12:21.842
Well, I'm not
paying for it.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.911
Oh, you don't have to.
They're pre-paid.

12:25.445 --> 12:26.513
(MOUTHING INDISTINCTLY)

12:26.579 --> 12:28.548
You paid
for the pizzas?

12:28.615 --> 12:31.885
Well, duh. I'm not
pranking the delivery guy.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.788
Hey, everybody,
free pizzas...on me!

12:37.357 --> 12:39.292
CLARK: She didn't order that.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.361
This is
awkward for her.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.430
Why do I smell
prosciutto and brie?

12:43.496 --> 12:45.999
Ask Damona.
This is her mess.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.534
Aah!

12:48.969 --> 12:50.838
Hey, Pat, free pizza.
Help yourself.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.605
Hells, yeah!

12:52.672 --> 12:55.208
Mmm! Oh,
caramelized figs!

12:55.275 --> 12:56.977
That's what
I'm talking about.

12:58.745 --> 12:59.980
Oh, grab
a slice quick.

13:00.047 --> 13:01.949
It's drizzled
with truffle oil.

13:02.015 --> 13:04.284
That was $12 extra.

13:04.351 --> 13:05.752
Oh, damn it!

13:07.354 --> 13:09.289
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
Hello!

13:09.356 --> 13:11.058
Oh, look who it is.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.093
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.328
Anyway, I have the
results from your monitor,

13:15.395 --> 13:16.796
and there were
some irregular beats

13:16.864 --> 13:19.166
and spikes in
your heart rate.
Really?

13:19.232 --> 13:20.868
Yeah, the first
one was at 7:30.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.870
Do you remember
what you were doing then?

13:22.936 --> 13:24.838
It was after dinner.
I was in the kitchen
talking to Allison.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.373
Mmm. 9:40?

13:26.439 --> 13:29.076
I was getting ready for bed,
talking to Allison.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.577
And 10:30?

13:30.643 --> 13:32.079
Talking to Allison!

13:32.145 --> 13:34.948
(GASPS) So you're saying
Allison is my stress trigger?

13:35.015 --> 13:36.884
Oh, no, there could be
lots of other reasons why...

13:36.950 --> 13:38.418
Oh, no, no,
I don't need "other."

13:38.485 --> 13:39.619
I need this!

13:39.686 --> 13:40.921
(LAUGHS)

13:40.988 --> 13:42.856
Otherwise, you have
a clean bill of health.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.225
A clean bill of health
gets me nothing.

13:45.292 --> 13:48.228
Lording this over Allison
till the end of time?

13:48.295 --> 13:51.498
Well, I would say "priceless"
if MasterCard hadn't
scorched that earth.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.373
Ah, hey, Bae.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.875
Oh, how was your day?

14:01.942 --> 14:04.744
Interesting.
Very interesting.

14:04.811 --> 14:07.480
(CHUCKLES)
A real eye-opener, even.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.317
I have to thank you,
Allison.

14:10.383 --> 14:13.420
You were so right
to make me get that physical.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.122
Young Julie actually
did find something

14:15.188 --> 14:16.990
that's slowly
killing me.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.859
What?
It's you, Allison.

14:19.927 --> 14:21.194
(CHUCKLES)

14:21.261 --> 14:23.931
Ta-da!
(CHUCKLES)

14:23.997 --> 14:26.766
Irrefutable proof that every
time we had a conversation,

14:26.833 --> 14:28.468
my heart rate spiked.

14:28.535 --> 14:29.602
That's right.

14:29.669 --> 14:30.971
You're my stress trigger.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.339
(LAUGHS)

14:32.405 --> 14:35.475
Come on. That's got
to be the dumbest
thing I ever heard.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.644
And you once dragged me
to see Dikembe Mutombo

14:37.710 --> 14:39.846
and Muggsy Bogues
in Of Mice and Men.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.882
Ooh, easy, trigger.

14:42.950 --> 14:44.684
You don't want this
sucker to blow.

14:44.751 --> 14:46.386
(SIGHS)

14:46.453 --> 14:49.089
Okay, I'm pressing pause
on this conversation

14:49.156 --> 14:50.423
because the Rutledges
will be here any minute,

14:50.490 --> 14:52.392
but we are
finishing this later.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.061
Ooh, forcing the
Rutledges on me.

14:54.127 --> 14:55.996
I see this as
a high-stress situation.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.000
Okay, just tell me,
how long is this
gonna go on?

15:00.067 --> 15:01.501
I don't know.
As long as I live?

15:01.568 --> 15:04.271
So, it's really up
to you, isn't it?

15:04.337 --> 15:05.505
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Got it.

15:05.572 --> 15:06.906
(GROANING)

15:11.878 --> 15:14.247
Clark, have you
seen Damona?

15:14.314 --> 15:15.782
I got her
this cruller

15:15.848 --> 15:18.418
as a thank-you for
the delicious pizzas
she treated us to.

15:19.219 --> 15:20.887
Yeah, she's a gem.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.224
Okay, that
cruller is mine.

15:24.291 --> 15:25.558
I'm the gem.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.727
I sparkle and shine.

15:29.829 --> 15:32.565
Well, I guess all's well
that ends well, then.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.402
I thought Damona
was my friend.

15:35.468 --> 15:38.871
Oh, good. More.

15:38.938 --> 15:42.409
I just don't understand
why she'd want to make me look
stupid in front of everyone.

15:42.475 --> 15:45.178
Well, you know how
when people are good friends,

15:45.245 --> 15:49.049
they'll often participate
in some light to
moderate joshing?

15:49.116 --> 15:50.517
So, you're saying,

15:50.583 --> 15:53.386
Damona's prank was
a sign of friendship?

15:53.453 --> 15:55.955
If it'll start my
weekend, yes.

16:00.093 --> 16:01.161
Hi.

16:01.228 --> 16:02.529
Mmm-hmm.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.064
I just wanted to say

16:04.131 --> 16:06.533
thanks for the
practical joke yesterday.

16:06.599 --> 16:07.834
I, um...

16:07.900 --> 16:09.669
I really value
our friendship.

16:11.038 --> 16:12.972
Wow! Clarky clark!

16:13.040 --> 16:14.674
I'm so glad you liked it.
You know, for a minute there,

16:14.741 --> 16:16.176
I thought you were upset,
but then I was like,

16:16.243 --> 16:18.611
"If he's upset, then why is he
getting me all these pizzas?"

16:20.613 --> 16:21.948
It was a prank.

16:22.015 --> 16:23.916
(INHALES DEEPLY)
I don't get it.

16:25.118 --> 16:26.319
Nobody did.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.255
Anyway, before
I understood that

16:28.321 --> 16:29.322
pranks were
a sign of affection,
I might have done...

16:29.389 --> 16:30.790
Ms. Damona,
your car is on fire.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.859
What?
It's not. It's not.

16:32.925 --> 16:34.661
It's a joke. Aah!

16:34.727 --> 16:36.063
I asked Juan Julio
to come in

16:36.129 --> 16:37.697
and tell you that
your car was on fire.

16:37.764 --> 16:41.168
No, no, Mr. Clark, you told me
to set her car on fire.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.605
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

16:45.672 --> 16:46.873
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

16:46.939 --> 16:48.541
Oh, my God!

16:48.608 --> 16:50.943
It's just too easy
with that guy, huh?

16:56.916 --> 16:58.418
That's fine.

16:58.485 --> 16:59.819
So, Ken, I got tickets
to the Clippers game
Saturday, if...

16:59.886 --> 17:02.922
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Andy.

17:02.989 --> 17:06.293
I'm really flattered,
but I got a full roster
of friends right now.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.595
Ken's just kidding.
He'd love to go to
the game with you.

17:08.661 --> 17:11.064
Oh, well, now that
I'm aware of my condition,

17:11.131 --> 17:12.799
I can really feel it
when you overstep.

17:15.302 --> 17:16.769
So, how are
the kids?

17:16.836 --> 17:18.004
Oh, they're great.

17:18.071 --> 17:20.140
Really? 'Cause Molly's
virtually unemployable,

17:20.207 --> 17:22.775
and Dave seems to have
turned their port-a-potty
into some kind of clubhouse.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.246
Don't listen to him.
They're fine.
(CHUCKLES)

17:26.313 --> 17:28.448
Oh, it's that kind of
dismissive attitude

17:28.515 --> 17:30.650
that really constricts
the blood flow to the heart.

17:30.717 --> 17:31.784
Medical fact.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.554
Are you okay, Ken?

17:34.621 --> 17:35.755
He's fine.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.824
So, how's the
commercial going, Barb?

17:37.890 --> 17:39.058
Getting any free Tampax?

17:39.126 --> 17:40.427
(ALL CHUCKLE)

17:40.493 --> 17:43.163
I'm not fine, Barb.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.265
Uh, they gave me
a lifetime supply of Supers.

17:45.332 --> 17:49.569
So, my doctor told me
I suffer from an irregular
heart rhythm,

17:49.636 --> 17:52.339
and the cause is
this special lady right here.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.474
Not true.

17:54.541 --> 17:57.944
Well, we'll see
what Mr. Holter monitor
has to say about that.

17:58.010 --> 17:59.512
You're still
wearing that?

17:59.579 --> 18:02.615
Yeah, as a precaution
because of all the danger.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.086
Ow!

18:07.154 --> 18:09.889
Great! Now you pulled out
both my chest hairs!

18:12.792 --> 18:15.962
I don't know why you're
always trying to force me
to be friends with that guy.

18:17.029 --> 18:18.198
Hey, relax.

18:18.265 --> 18:19.999
You got to admit
it is a little ironic

18:20.066 --> 18:21.601
that you were the one who
made me get the physical.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.102
Look at this.
Don't need to.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.138
It's all up here.

18:25.205 --> 18:27.607
Yes, we were talking during
each one of these spikes,

18:27.674 --> 18:29.976
but did it ever occur to you
what we were talking about?

18:30.743 --> 18:32.245
Here. 7:30.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.481
We were talking to Dave about
taking food from strangers.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.216
Here, Molly
getting fired again.

18:36.283 --> 18:37.884
And this big one
is when we found out

18:37.950 --> 18:40.187
Dave was eating turkey
burgers in a port-a-potty.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.356
So the kids are
my stress triggers?

18:43.423 --> 18:46.259
Of course.
You said it yourself
in the kitchen.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.495
Having kids
is super-stressful.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.497
Oh, but it's nice to know
that if it was me,

18:50.563 --> 18:51.698
this is how
you'd react.

18:58.070 --> 19:00.373
Hey, things sound
a little dicey.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.475
I mean, if you want
to talk about it over
a beer with Andy,

19:02.542 --> 19:04.010
I know he'd
love to just...

19:04.076 --> 19:05.812
ANDY: No, I wouldn't!

19:07.079 --> 19:08.248
He wouldn't.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.256
Al, still not
talking to me?

19:17.724 --> 19:19.125
(DOOR CLOSES)

19:19.192 --> 19:21.194
I'm sorry I blamed you
for all my stress.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.829
You know what?

19:22.895 --> 19:24.997
It's time for me to man up
and start blaming the kids.

19:27.534 --> 19:30.537
They're growing up.
They're a lot more work.

19:30.603 --> 19:31.704
That's why
I was freaked out

19:31.771 --> 19:34.106
that you hadn't had
a physical in so long.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.343
I need you around.
We all do.

19:36.409 --> 19:39.679
I get it. But don't worry.
I'm in perfect health.

19:39.746 --> 19:40.913
Check this.

19:44.984 --> 19:48.288
See? And I did all that
with a pulled groin.

19:49.722 --> 19:52.225
And I'm thrilled
you're healthy,

19:52.292 --> 19:54.994
but you can't blow off
any more check-ups, okay?

19:55.061 --> 19:57.397
(SCOFFS) You should
know better.
You're a doctor.

19:57.464 --> 20:00.032
That's the problem.

20:00.099 --> 20:02.669
I see disease every day,
and sometimes it...

20:03.603 --> 20:05.272
...scares me.

20:05.338 --> 20:07.307
Doctors make
the worst patients.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.575
No one's
worse than me.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.411
You're right about that.
(CHUCKLES)

20:11.478 --> 20:14.281
But you can't fight
what you don't find.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.982
And if we ever did
find anything,

20:16.048 --> 20:17.850
we'd deal with
it together.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.652
I love you so much.
(LAUGHS)

20:21.120 --> 20:22.489
And don't forget

20:22.555 --> 20:25.792
that body of yours
belongs to both of us.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.294
Huh?
Mmm.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.195
(BOTH LAUGH)

20:30.397 --> 20:31.831
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

20:31.898 --> 20:34.567
BARB: Hey, guys,
Andy's shaking up
some boggle. You in?

20:34.634 --> 20:35.635
Go home, Barb!

20:44.143 --> 20:46.379
Right through
there to the left.

20:46.446 --> 20:49.482
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mol,
what's with the
Son of Anarchy?

20:50.983 --> 20:52.619
You wanted me to
stop getting fired,

20:52.685 --> 20:54.220
so I became
my own boss.

20:54.287 --> 20:56.022
Instead of those
nasty port-a-potties,

20:56.088 --> 20:59.792
I offered the crew guys
a clean indoor bathroom
for a small fee.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.093
What?

21:01.160 --> 21:03.430
Look, sorry, buddy.
Business is closed.

21:07.233 --> 21:08.701
You can't
shut me down!

21:08.768 --> 21:10.737
How else am I supposed to
raise money for snowboarding?

21:10.803 --> 21:12.639
Besides, I have
employees to consider.

21:12.705 --> 21:13.706
BOTH: What?

21:13.773 --> 21:15.642
You sure you don't
want a hot towel,

21:15.708 --> 21:17.176
stick of gum,
cologne?

21:17.243 --> 21:18.578
How's your
day going?

21:18.645 --> 21:20.347
Nice to finally have
some weather.

21:21.514 --> 21:22.915
I'm spiking so
hard right now.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.183
Me too.
