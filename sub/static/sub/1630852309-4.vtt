00:07.380 --> 00:11.299
I was walking along the road
with two friends.

00:13.740 --> 00:16.179
The sun was setting.

00:16.979 --> 00:20.499
Suddenly the sky turned blood red.

00:22.499 --> 00:26.499
I paused, feeling exhausted,
and leaned on the fence.

00:27.100 --> 00:31.900
There was blood and tongues of fire
above the fjord and the city.

00:32.700 --> 00:36.779
-Can you take our photo?
-Of course.

00:42.300 --> 00:46.340
-Thank you.
-Will you join us for the ski jump?

00:46.859 --> 00:49.579
I think the tour bus is leaving soon.

00:49.660 --> 00:52.579
I would love to,
but I have an errand.

00:52.980 --> 00:57.179
Okay. Well, see you back
at the hotel, have a nice day.

00:57.259 --> 00:59.340
You too.

00:59.420 --> 01:04.380
The colours shrieked.
This became The Scream

01:38.979 --> 01:42.740
-How can I help you?
-I'm looking for a woman.

01:45.539 --> 01:50.660
A friend told me that she came
to pay a visit to this establishment.

01:51.220 --> 01:55.259
The woman I'm looking for
is a 19th century Brit.

01:56.259 --> 01:58.899
With a touch of nasal syphilis.

02:02.179 --> 02:05.419
I'd better get my cards for this.

02:36.699 --> 02:40.380
You wouldn't be trying
to warn anybody, would you?

02:44.259 --> 02:46.180
Please...

04:17.619 --> 04:21.539
-How does this work?
-This alerts the police.

04:21.619 --> 04:25.299
Press it, it triggers a full
response. That one goes to me.

04:25.379 --> 04:31.539
You can use that if the danger level
is lower, but you still need help.

04:31.619 --> 04:34.580
-You're so lucky...
-Hi!

04:34.900 --> 04:36.900
-Hi.
-You're coming, right?

04:36.979 --> 04:39.020
-Yes.
-We'll wait in the car.

04:39.100 --> 04:41.020
Hurry.

04:42.299 --> 04:46.299
-Where are you going?
-We're seeing Olaf's new house.

04:46.379 --> 04:50.220
-Is that such a good idea now?
-None of those guys are there.

04:50.299 --> 04:52.619
He's at a talk show.

04:54.340 --> 04:57.020
-But be careful, though.
-Yes.

04:59.419 --> 05:02.979
The single-copy newspaper
The Citizen recently published-

05:03.059 --> 05:07.580
-a story stating that the serial
killer Jack the Ripper is back.

05:07.660 --> 05:12.299
And that he was supposedly involved
in the subway murder at TÃ¸yen.

05:12.379 --> 05:16.340
This story, however, has
proven not to be rooted in reality.

05:16.419 --> 05:21.059
We are inexpressibly rueful
about the incident...

05:21.379 --> 05:23.580
Miss Winther?

05:26.379 --> 05:31.460
As the responsible journalist I
want to offer my unreserved apology-

05:31.539 --> 05:37.179
-to the Norwegian public. Last, but
by no means least, I am sorry for-

05:37.260 --> 05:42.100
-the unfounded fear and worry
I have exposed our readers to...

05:46.700 --> 05:50.660
-I see the circus is up and running?
-She'll vanish if she grovels more.

05:50.739 --> 05:55.499
The police have made several arrests
in the Neo Luddite community.

05:55.580 --> 05:59.460
The suspects have been arrested,
charged with willingly misleading-

05:59.539 --> 06:02.660
- the police authority and the press.
-That's correct.

06:02.739 --> 06:07.539
Among the arrested, is a person who
is a suspect in the tunnel murder.

06:07.619 --> 06:11.539
An English citizen, investigated for
a similar case in his homeland.

06:11.619 --> 06:15.660
He will be extradited to
the London Metropolitan Police-

06:15.739 --> 06:17.859
-effective immediately.

06:17.939 --> 06:21.700
What the hell?
Have you heard about this?

06:22.700 --> 06:25.580
No.

06:25.660 --> 06:30.539
So, miss Winther, what was
the motive behind this false claim?

06:31.140 --> 06:33.460
Thank you very much.

06:35.780 --> 06:39.539
You can't extradite Ben Joseph
without checking with us first.

06:39.619 --> 06:42.499
I'm sorry that
the flow of information was faulty.

06:42.580 --> 06:44.619
But the decision has been made.

06:44.700 --> 06:47.539
Do we at least get one last
interrogation before they get him?

06:47.619 --> 06:52.140
The paperwork for this has
started, so that might be difficult.

06:52.220 --> 06:57.140
-This is not bloody okay, Harald.
-The press is here. Keep it down.

06:57.220 --> 07:01.059
Yes... We'll continue
this discussion later.

07:01.140 --> 07:04.140
Now, the Chief of Police and I
have a Q&A.

07:09.340 --> 07:13.739
-Are you sure this is a good idea?
-We have to give it a try.

07:23.140 --> 07:25.379
There is only time for a brief talk.

07:25.460 --> 07:28.820
-You are being extradited.
-No recording device?

07:28.900 --> 07:33.059
Where were you the night the woman
was killed in the tunnels?

07:33.140 --> 07:35.499
What were you doing
at the time of the murder?

07:35.580 --> 07:38.660
I was here in Oslo searching for him.

07:38.739 --> 07:41.900
And by him you mean..?

07:44.820 --> 07:47.379
Is this the man you were looking for?

07:48.179 --> 07:50.140
Yes, sir.

07:51.580 --> 07:55.580
-And you think he killed our woman?
-I do.

07:55.900 --> 08:00.260
So, what's the deal?
Is he some Jack the Ripper copycat?

08:01.059 --> 08:03.460
Oh no.

08:05.340 --> 08:09.220
-He's the real Jack.
-Excuse?

08:09.580 --> 08:13.460
-What's your question, my dear?
-The man is from now.

08:13.539 --> 08:15.739
How can he be Check?

08:15.820 --> 08:18.299
Our little chat is over.
The cavalry is here.

08:18.379 --> 08:23.419
-Answer me. How can he be Check?
-He travelled backwards in time.

08:24.979 --> 08:29.820
The general consensus is that
backwards time travel is impossible.

08:29.900 --> 08:32.820
The general consensus is wrong.

08:35.820 --> 08:40.180
MPS formally took over responsibility
for Ben Joseph this morning.

08:40.259 --> 08:43.060
Any meeting
should have been cleared with us.

08:43.139 --> 08:46.019
Bureaucracy is not my strength.

08:49.940 --> 08:54.460
B'ezrat hashem, I wish you the
best of luck, fellow truth seekers.

08:54.540 --> 08:58.019
My feeling is you're gonna need it.

09:00.420 --> 09:05.180
Here, I picture knocking down
some walls and making a lounge.

09:05.259 --> 09:09.979
-With some downlights here, right?
-Holy shit, it's nice!

09:10.060 --> 09:14.180
-This is like the main living room.
-How much is the rent?

09:14.259 --> 09:18.540
Nothing, the church rents it for free
to Olaf after he was acknowledged.

09:18.619 --> 09:22.739
This is the dining room, kind of...

09:37.580 --> 09:41.580
-I'm so looking forward to it...
-It's so nice here.

09:52.540 --> 09:54.700
Madde?

09:55.700 --> 09:57.739
Madde?

10:06.019 --> 10:09.220
We agreed
not to be in touch in this time.

10:09.300 --> 10:13.340
Olaf asked me to come.
He needs help with a memory.

10:14.540 --> 10:18.779
Well... It can't have been
that important to him.

10:18.859 --> 10:21.460
He's on a talk show right now.

10:23.460 --> 10:26.859
You don't need to be afraid.

10:26.940 --> 10:30.619
I have no intention
of stealing your Olaf.

10:32.460 --> 10:34.580
I don't fear anything.

10:36.180 --> 10:40.180
I just don't want to have
any more business with you.

10:40.259 --> 10:43.540
-Can I give him a message?
-No.

10:43.619 --> 10:46.019
Olaf gave me his mobile phone number.

10:46.100 --> 10:49.739
I'll arrange
a new meeting with him directly.

10:59.460 --> 11:02.779
-Who was that woman?
-Just...

11:03.739 --> 11:06.779
Some Olaf stalker.

11:07.499 --> 11:11.739
Can you tell us
what happened down in custody?

11:11.820 --> 11:15.779
-What do you mean?
-The collaboration is delicate.

11:15.859 --> 11:21.220
-No improvised interrogations today.
-There were follow-up questions.

11:21.300 --> 11:25.659
London are furious. They demand
that we give them the sound log-

11:25.739 --> 11:29.739
- with transcriptions.
-We have no recordings.

11:32.100 --> 11:36.820
You had clear instructions to record
every interview with Ben Joseph.

11:36.899 --> 11:40.580
I meant to press rec, but you
know... us Norse people and machines.

11:40.659 --> 11:42.659
This is just getting worse and worse.

11:42.739 --> 11:47.019
You do understand that you cannot be
involved in the case after this?

11:47.100 --> 11:50.180
-Are you taking us off the case?
-We have no choice.

11:50.259 --> 11:56.060
I'm informing the English police that
you two no longer will be involved.

11:56.460 --> 11:59.220
Wenche takes over
all communication with England.

11:59.300 --> 12:04.619
-She leads the case from our side.
-What the hell are we two doing now?

12:06.100 --> 12:09.580
The woman was
reported missing this morning.

12:09.659 --> 12:12.540
And so far, there
haven't been any signs of the woman.

12:12.619 --> 12:16.540
I noted on the site inspection that
there was a phone charger there.

12:16.619 --> 12:19.580
But we have yet to find the phone.

12:20.139 --> 12:23.739
Who's contacting
the service providers?

12:25.700 --> 12:29.779
-We're not ready to deal with this...
-Did the woman have a mobile?

12:29.859 --> 12:31.940
Sure.

12:33.499 --> 12:38.340
How about I get on that now, and we
go all in together tomorrow morning?

12:38.420 --> 12:41.139
Sounds like a plan.

13:29.499 --> 13:34.060
Do you see the part that looks like
a sea horse? Thats the hippocampus.

13:34.139 --> 13:37.499
It controls things like
memories and perception of time.

13:37.580 --> 13:40.379
Things people
with TSD struggle with.

13:41.580 --> 13:44.820
And how does the sea horse
in my skull look?

13:44.899 --> 13:49.899
Your hippocampus is much larger
and much more active than normal.

13:51.820 --> 13:55.180
-So, I don't have TSD?
-That we can rule out.

13:55.259 --> 13:59.739
We've never seen TSD where
the hippocampus wasn't injured.

13:59.820 --> 14:03.100
Your cognitive tests were unique.

14:03.180 --> 14:07.859
I don't think I've ever measured
such high scores before.

14:07.940 --> 14:11.940
If everything is tip-top, there's
no point in digging any further.

14:12.019 --> 14:17.379
If the deviation is caused by
timeigration, you're a unique case.

14:17.460 --> 14:21.899
I'd love to share these findings
with the Institute of Time Research.

14:21.979 --> 14:25.859
-If you just sign here...
-No, I won't.

14:25.940 --> 14:31.940
I want you to give me my journal,
and for you to delete all copies.

14:32.019 --> 14:35.460
This is so interesting research-wise,
but also for you personally.

14:35.540 --> 14:37.540
Will you do as I say?

14:37.619 --> 14:42.420
Or do I have to get in touch with
the beforeigner ombudsman?

14:49.259 --> 14:53.180
I probably overreacted by pressing
that thing. I just freaked out.

14:53.259 --> 14:57.019
-When did you find it?
-When I came home from Madde.

15:03.060 --> 15:05.180
What is that?

15:05.580 --> 15:09.619
-This is like some mafia thing...
-Looks like it's from a hare...

15:10.700 --> 15:14.180
-Fucking hell.
-He must have picked the lock.

15:14.899 --> 15:19.460
-You see? What do I do now?
-Go to Mum's. Immediately.

15:33.019 --> 15:35.340
-Hi
-Hi.

15:35.420 --> 15:40.139
Are you familiar with that Norse
weatherman, Sturla Arnesson?

15:44.100 --> 15:47.340
You're sure Sturla is at the gym?

15:47.420 --> 15:50.820
He just posted a selfie from there.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.499
My God...

16:05.259 --> 16:08.420
So, who really perished
at Stiklestad?

16:08.820 --> 16:11.220
A replacement.

16:15.259 --> 16:18.420
Good evening, lovely warrior.

16:18.499 --> 16:22.420
I didn't take you for
someone who likes contemporary cock.

16:22.499 --> 16:25.739
I guess a cock is a cock
no matter how it hangs.

16:25.820 --> 16:29.940
Hi. I'm Lars Haaland.
I'm Ingrid's father.

16:35.979 --> 16:38.300
Ingrid is a fair, lovely woman.

16:38.379 --> 16:43.300
-It's an honour to meet her father.
-I know that Ingrid is pregnant.

16:43.379 --> 16:47.259
And I know you are trying to
threaten her into keeping the baby.

16:47.340 --> 16:51.060
-I would never threaten Ingrid.
-Is that right?

16:51.139 --> 16:56.220
Us Norse people have more emotions
than you contemporaries.

16:57.739 --> 17:01.820
So, we sometimes act out more.

17:01.899 --> 17:07.459
But I've never threatened anyone. So,
she's probably just misunderstood.

17:07.540 --> 17:12.899
You should be aware that I'm a cop.
I'm keeping an eye on you.

17:13.699 --> 17:17.459
-So, no need to worry.
-That's good.

17:19.980 --> 17:22.419
It was nice to meet you.

17:27.540 --> 17:30.699
How did the talk go?

17:36.179 --> 17:38.459
-What did he say?
-I'm not sure.

17:40.060 --> 17:44.219
Come on, I saw that you heard
what he said. What did he say?

17:45.060 --> 17:48.899
I guess it means
Father of a whore or something...

18:16.699 --> 18:19.859
-That went well.
-Yes, I kind of lost it.

18:19.939 --> 18:22.020
No skitr...

18:22.980 --> 18:25.500
I know that was way out of line.

18:25.580 --> 18:29.619
I understand
if you feel you have to report it.

18:31.179 --> 18:35.939
I don't think the rules are as
strict for external consultants.

20:56.500 --> 21:01.659
Alfhildr and I apologise
for our behaviour yesterday.

21:01.740 --> 21:03.740
Being taken off the tunnel murder,-

21:03.820 --> 21:05.820
-is no excuse
for not contributing here.

21:05.899 --> 21:08.580
Both you and the missing woman
deserve better -

21:08.659 --> 21:12.859
-than two police officers with their
heads up their asses.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.459
We confirmed that the
soothsayer had a mobile.

21:15.540 --> 21:17.820
The service provider
checked the geo data.

21:17.899 --> 21:21.820
There hasn't been any activity
on it since she went missing.

21:21.899 --> 21:26.500
I got her call log, in case there
should be anything there.

21:35.699 --> 21:39.899
She tried calling someone seconds
before the phone was disconnected.

21:39.980 --> 21:45.260
-Could it be an emergency number?
-No. The log would have shown that.

21:48.699 --> 21:51.580
-Did you trace the call?
-The number was unregistered.

21:51.659 --> 21:56.020
Probably a burner. Lars is talking
to the phone shop where it was sold.

21:56.100 --> 22:01.260
It was a hit. The security consultant
can see us now. Are you coming?

22:04.740 --> 22:10.340
Wait. A police dog has marked on a
container near the fun fair grounds.

22:11.419 --> 22:14.980
You go ahead.
We'll follow up on the phone lead.

22:20.459 --> 22:22.459
Hey!

22:26.500 --> 22:30.179
-How is Sturla?
-Concussion.

22:30.260 --> 22:33.139
That pig will fucking pay.

22:36.260 --> 22:38.580
Hello?
Seatbelt.

22:39.939 --> 22:42.379
Seatbelts are for sissies.

22:44.500 --> 22:47.540
You want to know what's for sissies?

22:47.619 --> 22:50.619
Having to pay
a fine of several thousand.

23:02.659 --> 23:04.980
Hi.

23:05.060 --> 23:07.859
-Could you open it?
-Yes.

23:18.219 --> 23:21.419
What time was this, did you say?

23:22.459 --> 23:26.820
The purchase
is registered on the 25th.

24:16.899 --> 24:20.379
-Could it be there?
-It's here.

24:20.459 --> 24:25.340
The girl's name is on the letterbox.
Ingrid, wasn't it?

24:26.419 --> 24:30.379
-Then that must be her father.
-Okay. Let's go.

25:04.820 --> 25:07.859
What errand do you have here,
gentlemen?

25:11.100 --> 25:13.580
This is from Sturla.

25:47.619 --> 25:50.459
But that's not the father.

25:50.540 --> 25:52.580
-Are you kidding?
-No.

25:52.659 --> 25:55.899
No. The guy
at the gym was contemporary.

26:03.260 --> 26:06.540
Is it confirmed that the
woman you found was the soothsayer?

26:06.619 --> 26:10.699
-Everything points in that direction.
-Look.

26:10.780 --> 26:14.899
Here's the one
who made the purchase in question.

26:22.020 --> 26:24.820
I've seen her before.

26:27.659 --> 26:30.459
There's a photo of her
in a folder Alex and I came across.

26:30.540 --> 26:34.580
-From the Neo Luddite farm?
-Alex said it wasn't worth anything.

26:34.659 --> 26:39.859
It was an arrival file from a group
of women who had timeigrated.

26:42.260 --> 26:44.580
I don't get this.

26:44.659 --> 26:48.179
This is clearly the
woman the soothsayer called...

26:48.260 --> 26:52.060
And here we have
the victim of the subway murder.

27:36.459 --> 27:39.540
Thanks for the help so far.

27:41.580 --> 27:45.699
The transit centre confirmed that
the women arrived near DrÃ¸bak.

27:46.820 --> 27:49.699
Why has this
not showed up in our searches?

27:49.780 --> 27:51.939
They weren't registered in INSYS.

27:52.020 --> 27:54.260
They have
an ongoing case about extradition-

27:54.340 --> 27:58.540
-regarding the Schengen Agreement
about arrival in foreign waters.

27:58.619 --> 28:02.179
If there's a link between the
soothsayer and the tunnel murder,-

28:02.260 --> 28:04.780
-shouldn't we notify management?

28:06.939 --> 28:12.100
I think we need a a bit more before
we can present that link to them.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.540
What do you think?

28:23.619 --> 28:27.939
Is it the guy Ben Joseph
was talking about who is doing this?

28:45.459 --> 28:49.419
I just did a tarot reading
and had a vision of you.

29:14.939 --> 29:16.899
Yes?

29:23.939 --> 29:27.899
Hi. I'm sorry for
pulling you away from work, but...

29:27.980 --> 29:33.459
-He insisted on talking to you.
-Did he say what it was about?

29:33.540 --> 29:38.939
Just that you needed to have what
he called a gentlemen's discussion.

29:39.020 --> 29:44.179
Maybe it's something medical that
he finds embarrassing to tell me.

29:44.260 --> 29:46.740
-Yes...
-He's in here.

29:54.300 --> 29:57.899
This really sucks, Gregers.

29:57.980 --> 30:01.379
It's merely a few scratches.

30:01.459 --> 30:05.540
If the girls would excuse us
for a moment?

30:05.619 --> 30:07.980
Ingrid, come, let's go outside.

30:11.100 --> 30:15.060
So...
What did you want to talk about?

30:15.139 --> 30:18.939
Well, it's about today's assault.

30:19.020 --> 30:21.699
I don't want
to worry them needlessly,-

30:21.780 --> 30:24.580
-but I doubt it was a coincidence.

30:24.980 --> 30:27.820
-No?
-I suspect-

30:27.899 --> 30:31.580
-this weatherman of Ingrid's
is behind it.

30:32.419 --> 30:37.379
The attackers were Norse, and one of
them said this was from Sturla and-

30:37.459 --> 30:40.740
- then whacked me over the noggin.
-Oh fuck.

30:40.820 --> 30:43.219
That's one way of putting it.

30:43.300 --> 30:47.740
Do you have any hypothesis on why
they implemented such a measure?

30:47.820 --> 30:50.580
No, not really.

30:50.659 --> 30:55.780
It's important that you
level with me now, Lars.

30:56.300 --> 30:59.100
You see, some confusion arose in the
course of the tumult.

30:59.179 --> 31:04.179
I got the impression that the attack
was, well, directed at you.

31:17.939 --> 31:24.899
This is my fault... I managed to get
myself into a confrontation-

31:24.980 --> 31:28.699
-with that Sturla guy
yesterday evening.

31:28.780 --> 31:31.500
-Lars...
-Yes, I know.

31:32.300 --> 31:37.020
I didn't mean to. I was just
going to talk to him. And then...

31:38.659 --> 31:41.419
I lost it completely.

31:45.619 --> 31:49.859
I'm sorry. I wish I could
swap places with you right now.

31:49.939 --> 31:53.100
Oh well...

31:53.699 --> 31:57.820
Now, don't be
too hard on yourself, Lars.

31:58.300 --> 32:00.619
All things considered,-

32:00.699 --> 32:04.980
-you are simply a father
who defended a tested daughter.

32:05.619 --> 32:09.100
I think you're taking this
surprisingly well.

32:10.820 --> 32:13.540
What do you think Marie will say?

32:14.340 --> 32:17.540
Perhaps we should wait-

32:17.619 --> 32:22.340
-before informing the others of the
details until I have recovered a bit?

32:22.419 --> 32:25.939
Are you sure that's a good idea?
There may still be a threat here.

32:26.020 --> 32:30.139
I gave one of the louts
a nasty smack with my pipe.

32:30.780 --> 32:33.899
They will probably also
be licking their wounds tonight.

32:33.980 --> 32:38.859
Direct hit. Clack.
Straight on the noggin.

33:01.500 --> 33:05.260
-Do you mind?
-Not at all.

33:07.379 --> 33:10.419
I'll take what he's having.

33:13.020 --> 33:17.340
-So, where's your mummy tonight?
-She finally went to her room.

33:17.419 --> 33:21.260
So now the daughter
gets to spread her wings?

33:23.740 --> 33:27.740
-Do you have a family?
-Oh, nothing much to speak of.

33:28.939 --> 33:33.060
-Work has taken up most of my time.
-Which line of work?

33:33.139 --> 33:37.500
It used to be quantum physics,
but then I got bored.

33:38.300 --> 33:41.419
And now my interests have...

33:41.500 --> 33:44.379
Drifted somewhat.

33:44.980 --> 33:50.699
And what tickles your
scientific curiosity these days?

33:53.219 --> 33:57.020
Mostly close encounters
with the female anatomy.

34:22.659 --> 34:25.139
Why don't you stay the night?

34:25.219 --> 34:28.940
-We can go again in the morning.
-No thanks.

34:47.860 --> 34:50.500
It's another woman.

34:55.259 --> 34:59.659
I need to blow off some steam after
an email marathon with MPS.

35:01.619 --> 35:04.020
Do you want to go out for a bit?

35:06.460 --> 35:09.980
-Sure. Where are we going?
-Come.

35:12.139 --> 35:15.900
-The loser buys a pint.
-Do you want to risk it?

35:15.980 --> 35:20.380
-I feel sharp today.
-Try me. I'm a four times medalist-

35:20.460 --> 35:23.619
-in the East Norwegian police
championship in short track shooting.

35:23.699 --> 35:28.380
Are these for me so that I don't
have to listen to your bragging?

36:12.219 --> 36:14.659
What's that?

36:14.739 --> 36:19.659
The dust of the White Christ. It
makes God's flame burn stronger.

36:26.460 --> 36:29.060
Breathe it in.

37:14.020 --> 37:17.739
You will once again be king.
Did you see?

37:19.460 --> 37:23.219
I saw it.
Clear as day.

37:31.900 --> 37:34.179
I liked that divine dust.

37:36.139 --> 37:39.580
It had truth in it.

37:39.659 --> 37:42.619
I'll give you a bag before you leave.

37:45.699 --> 37:48.619
And you believe
that this Engingsdottir-

37:48.699 --> 37:51.619
-has a role to play
in my return to power?

37:52.179 --> 37:54.819
As sure as day follows night.

38:24.779 --> 38:29.420
A fire is burning in her
that is not of this world.

38:31.619 --> 38:34.940
So, Madeleine
has nothing to contribute?

38:35.020 --> 38:38.900
All my doubts vanished when
I felt the power of the Motherless.

38:43.060 --> 38:46.219
What is it,
the force that she possesses?

38:46.299 --> 38:50.659
I only know this: That woman
has been touched by the Gods.

38:55.259 --> 38:59.900
Hey.
Well? What do you think?

39:01.779 --> 39:05.779
-You'll struggle to win this round.
-Is that right?

39:18.580 --> 39:23.060
You only hit with one, though.
It is a bullseye, but still...

39:23.980 --> 39:26.139
This pint is on you.

39:27.219 --> 39:32.819
Judgment day has come!
We are the children God forgot!

39:33.299 --> 39:38.299
There is no point in seeking shelter,
for the storm is already here!

39:39.100 --> 39:41.860
Listen!

39:47.339 --> 39:50.980
We just talked
to the phone service provider.

39:51.060 --> 39:54.940
There was activity on
the victim's cell phone last night.

39:55.020 --> 39:58.339
We'll have to
involve management after all.

40:00.219 --> 40:04.860
The one behind the tunnel murder,
killed the soothsayer too, we think.

40:04.940 --> 40:07.739
The killer is now
on the loose in Oslo.

40:07.819 --> 40:12.540
And you're certain that this
is the victim of the tunnel murder?

40:15.139 --> 40:19.299
I'd like to discuss this with
the Chief of Police before we decide.

40:19.380 --> 40:21.940
This is not the time to hesitate.

40:22.020 --> 40:25.420
As long as there's a chance that
Lars' theory is right, we must act.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.900
If another woman is killed
and we could have stopped it,-

40:27.980 --> 40:31.860
-you're the one
who has to live with that decision.

40:35.540 --> 40:37.819
We'll take action.

40:37.900 --> 40:41.540
-Do we have a location for the phone?
-Pick up any signals?

40:41.619 --> 40:45.980
Nothing so far.
Let me try something else.

41:16.179 --> 41:18.339
-Is it him?
-Yes.

41:18.420 --> 41:21.139
-Is he moving?
-It seems like it.

41:28.219 --> 41:31.980
Sierra 3.0 to HQ. We're
approaching the Ekeberg forest.

41:32.060 --> 41:37.060
-Any change of position, over?
-The target is still moving. Over.

41:49.900 --> 41:52.500
Don't fight the inevitable.

42:20.299 --> 42:24.380
We're now approaching
the indicated position. Over.

42:56.339 --> 42:58.580
Found something!
