Hey.

00:07.560 --> 00:09.760
Hey.

00:14.048 --> 00:14.816
Everything okay?

00:14.817 --> 00:16.751
Yeah.

00:16.753 --> 00:19.904
I just can't remember
what I came down here for.

00:19.906 --> 00:23.274
Oh. That happens
to me all the time.

00:23.276 --> 00:27.478
I-I can't remember
a specific example, but yeah.

00:27.480 --> 00:29.163
Yeah, that's annoying.

00:29.165 --> 00:30.364
Uh, maybe you were hungry.

00:30.366 --> 00:32.198
Did you come down
to get something to eat?

00:32.201 --> 00:34.034
No, I just ate.

00:34.036 --> 00:35.352
Were you going to watch TV?

00:35.354 --> 00:38.089
No. I have a TV
in my room.

00:38.091 --> 00:40.074
This is very disconcerting.

00:40.076 --> 00:43.160
Don't panic. I mean,
we'll figure this out.

00:43.162 --> 00:44.845
Did you come down
to give me the money you owe me?

00:44.847 --> 00:46.547
Ah.

00:46.549 --> 00:48.432
It's worth a shot.

00:48.434 --> 00:51.135
No. I was upstairs,
and I thought to myself,

00:51.137 --> 00:53.854
"I need
to come downstairs and..."

00:57.527 --> 00:59.510
You know what might help?

00:59.512 --> 01:00.694
A little less...

01:00.696 --> 01:02.613
"Whoa, dude, where's my car?"

01:02.615 --> 01:04.348
No, it's not the pot.

01:04.349 --> 01:06.784
I've been smoking pot since...

01:06.786 --> 01:09.453
It's... it's not the pot.

01:09.455 --> 01:11.956

down here for?

02:00.364 --> 02:02.615
Thank you so much
for sending that car for me.

02:02.617 --> 02:05.168
I mean, I felt like a big
ol' movie star at the airport.

02:05.170 --> 02:07.420
The driver held up a sign
with my name on it,

02:07.422 --> 02:10.539
carried my bags, and even gave
me a bottle of what from Fiji.

02:10.542 --> 02:13.209
It probably
wasn't from Fiji...

02:13.211 --> 02:14.711
Would you look at this house?

02:14.713 --> 02:16.663
I mean, right here
on the ocean.

02:16.665 --> 02:18.264
This is like something
you would see in a magazine,

02:18.266 --> 02:19.499
except there would be
famous people

02:19.501 --> 02:20.900
standing here instead of us.

02:21.635 --> 02:23.520
It is so nice to see you.

02:23.522 --> 02:25.288
Well, it is nice
to see you, too. Let me...

02:25.290 --> 02:26.890
Uh, Missi, let me
introduce you to my friend...

02:26.892 --> 02:28.224
Hi, I'm Missi.

02:28.226 --> 02:30.110
Everyone thinks
it's short for Melissa,

02:30.112 --> 02:31.144
but it's actually short
for Mississippi--

02:31.146 --> 02:32.278
the river not the state--

02:32.280 --> 02:33.563
'cause according to my parents,

02:33.565 --> 02:35.198
I was conceived on the deck
of a gambling boat

02:35.200 --> 02:37.901
when my daddy won a $5,000
jackpot on the Caribbean poker.

02:37.903 --> 02:39.986
Wow, that's a...
Have you ever been to the Caribbean?

02:39.988 --> 02:42.188
I went there three years ago
for spring break,

02:42.190 --> 02:44.190
and got stung by a jellyfish.

02:44.192 --> 02:45.825
My friend had to pee on my leg.

02:47.027 --> 02:49.862
Alan.

02:49.864 --> 02:52.749
Uh, it's nice to meet you.
It's nice to meet you, too.

02:52.751 --> 02:54.834
Um, could you direct me
to the little girl's room?

02:54.836 --> 02:56.219
I mean, unless one of y'all

02:56.221 --> 02:58.371
have recently been
stung by a jellyfish.

02:58.373 --> 02:59.506
Oh, it's right here.

02:59.508 --> 03:00.890
Thank you.

03:00.892 --> 03:02.875
Wow.

03:02.877 --> 03:04.427
She's a pistol.

03:04.429 --> 03:08.014
More like an AK-47.

03:08.016 --> 03:10.517
So, uh, what's, uh...
what's the story here?

03:10.519 --> 03:11.901
Uh, you and her...?

03:11.903 --> 03:13.853
No. She's my old friend
Jerry's daughter... - Oh.

03:13.855 --> 03:16.222
...and she's thinking
about moving here, so I told him

03:16.224 --> 03:19.275
she could stay here for a couple
days, and I'd show her around.

03:19.277 --> 03:21.778
Mm. She's very pretty.

03:25.199 --> 03:26.583
Yeah?

03:26.585 --> 03:28.785
How old do you think she is?

03:30.205 --> 03:33.006
Like, 18 or 19.

03:33.008 --> 03:34.424
Oh, perfect.
You might lose a friend,

03:34.426 --> 03:35.708
but you won't go to jail.

Ow! Hey! Hey, hey, don't hit

all day just like
a big ol' lizard.

03:57.899 --> 03:59.983
Back home,
I have to get a spray tan, and

03:59.985 --> 04:01.284
sometimes it comes
out a little orange,

04:01.286 --> 04:02.702
which is totally fine
during Halloween

that I'm going as a pumpkin.

04:04.272 --> 04:05.872
Oh, that's interesting.
I love

04:05.874 --> 04:08.291
Halloween. Last year, I went
to this party as a slutty nurse,

04:08.293 --> 04:10.543
and then, the year before that,
I was a slutty cat,

04:10.545 --> 04:12.412
and the year before that,
I was a ladybug.

04:12.414 --> 04:13.613
A slutty ladybug?

04:13.615 --> 04:16.716
What? No!
Why would I be a slutty ladybug?

04:16.718 --> 04:18.750
Oh, I just...

04:18.753 --> 04:20.553

04:26.344 --> 04:27.927
I have a gay friend.
His name is Russell.

04:27.929 --> 04:30.480
I got him to make out with me
one time, but it didn't take.

04:30.482 --> 04:33.016
No. We... we
are not gay.

04:33.018 --> 04:35.735
We are definitely not gay.

04:35.737 --> 04:37.687
Uh...

04:37.689 --> 04:40.023

04:40.025 --> 04:41.407
you're thinking
about relocating.

04:41.409 --> 04:42.525
Well, to be honest with you,

04:42.527 --> 04:44.110
I'm not really sure
what I want to do.

04:44.112 --> 04:46.079
You know, I can always keep
working as a dental assistant.

04:46.081 --> 04:48.031
You know, that person that sucks
the spit out of your mouth

04:48.033 --> 04:49.365
with that little wetvac
Yes.

04:49.367 --> 04:51.501
and then gives you the free
toothbrush and the lollipop.

04:51.503 --> 04:53.186
You do know
what the lollipop's for, right?

04:53.188 --> 04:55.755
Well, I'm assuming...
Repeat business.

04:55.757 --> 04:57.257
You know,

04:57.259 --> 04:59.459
if it were up to me, I'd just
give them caramel apple

04:59.461 --> 05:00.627
or a little taffy or something.

05:00.629 --> 05:02.211
Pull their teeth right out
of their little heads.

you make money off children.

Do you have a girlfriend?

05:12.374 --> 05:14.357
Uh... no, I do not.

05:14.359 --> 05:16.559
I just went through a breakup.

05:16.561 --> 05:18.144
Oh, you poor baby.

05:18.146 --> 05:19.679
I am so sorry.

Could you put some
suntan lotion on my back?

Uh, sure.

that we saw each other?

08:10.819 --> 08:12.368
At dinner?

08:12.370 --> 08:13.486
No, silly. I'm talking about

08:13.488 --> 08:15.020
when I was, like,
eight years old,

08:15.022 --> 08:18.157
and you came to visit us, and
we all went to the state fair.

08:18.159 --> 08:19.859

Remember you had

08:21.830 --> 08:23.162
'cause my dad was working late?

08:23.164 --> 08:25.798
And we ate cotton candy
for dinner, and then you won me

08:25.800 --> 08:27.700
that little stuffed pig
in the squirt-gun horse race?

08:27.702 --> 08:29.635
I used to practice
my kissing on him.

08:29.637 --> 08:32.672
That's a lucky pig.

08:32.674 --> 08:35.091
Eventually, I wore out all
the terry cloth on his snout,

08:35.092 --> 08:37.809
but it was actually okay, 'cause
by that time, I changed over

08:37.812 --> 08:40.763
to real boys, which, turns out
a couple of them were pigs, too.

08:40.765 --> 08:42.265
Yeah, pigs.

08:42.267 --> 08:46.102
Do you want a robe or a blanket
or a suit of armor?

08:46.104 --> 08:47.487
Oh, no, no, no, no.

08:47.489 --> 08:50.156
I'm fine. And remember, I wanted
to go on the tilt-a-whirl,

08:50.158 --> 08:51.574
but my mom was too scared,

08:51.576 --> 08:53.109
so you said you'd sit next
to her, but I wanted you

08:53.111 --> 08:54.577
to sit next to me,
so you sat in between us,

08:54.579 --> 08:55.745
and you held both of our hands?

08:55.747 --> 08:57.446
But actually, you were
the one that got scared

08:57.448 --> 08:58.664
and started praying real loud.

08:58.666 --> 09:00.750
"Oh, Lord,
please get me off this ride!"

09:00.752 --> 09:03.202
I think you even tinkled
a little bit.

09:03.204 --> 09:06.005
Oh, it's a good memory.

09:06.007 --> 09:09.542
I remember 'cause it was one
of the best days ever.

09:09.544 --> 09:11.627
Aw.

09:13.581 --> 09:14.881
Are you lonely?

09:14.883 --> 09:19.268
Uh, you know, I-I got Alan.

09:20.971 --> 09:23.723
Yeah, but Alan doesn't
keep you warm at night.

09:23.725 --> 09:25.191
You'd be surprised.

09:25.193 --> 09:27.259
'Cause he, uh...

09:27.261 --> 09:30.112
Listen, um, I have this idea.

09:30.114 --> 09:33.649
You know, you might think
that it's kind of crazy.

09:33.651 --> 09:35.117
Okay.

09:35.119 --> 09:38.454
I was just thinking,
you know, since you're single,

09:38.456 --> 09:41.607
and-and you're super hot
and a really nice guy...

09:41.609 --> 09:43.275
Yeah.

09:43.277 --> 09:45.411
That, you know, maybe

09:45.413 --> 09:47.997
you'd like to hook up
with my mom.

09:55.138 --> 09:57.390
What?

09:57.392 --> 09:59.425
She's been all alone
ever since my daddy ran off

09:59.427 --> 10:00.810
with that lady
from the dry cleaners--

10:00.812 --> 10:02.428
you know, the one
with that weird eye

10:02.430 --> 10:03.813
that won't quite open
all the way.

10:03.815 --> 10:05.765
Probably from all
them dry cleaning fumes.

10:05.767 --> 10:07.066
You know, we should have
seen it coming.

10:07.068 --> 10:08.601
She gave him all the clothes
that nobody claimed.

10:08.603 --> 10:09.936
He had, like, four tuxedos.

10:09.938 --> 10:11.687
Wait. Wait.

10:11.689 --> 10:14.156
You want to set me
up with your mom?

10:14.158 --> 10:15.808
She kind of always
had a thing for you,

10:15.810 --> 10:17.410
but she would kill me
if I told you.

10:17.412 --> 10:20.479
Okay, Missi, I don't
think that's a good idea...

10:20.481 --> 10:22.615
Just think about it, okay?

10:22.617 --> 10:24.083
Okay.

10:24.085 --> 10:26.318
Great.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.087
Oh, and if it helps at all,

10:28.089 --> 10:29.622
she actually just got
her boobs done.

10:29.624 --> 10:31.090
They actually used mine
as a model.

10:31.092 --> 10:33.292
The doctor even put 'em
in his catalogue-- number 244.

10:33.294 --> 10:34.694
Anyone can't get 'em,

10:34.696 --> 10:36.495
but it's kind of weird now
when I walk around town

10:36.497 --> 10:38.798
I just keep thinking
I see my boobs everywhere.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.967
Good night.

10:44.839 --> 10:47.807
Her mom?

10:49.860 --> 10:51.494
When did I
become the guy

10:51.496 --> 10:53.729
that the hot 19-year-old
looks at and goes,

10:53.731 --> 10:56.966
"Hey, you'd be great
for my mom"?

10:56.968 --> 10:58.234
Count your blessings.

10:58.236 --> 10:59.819
One of my patients
tried to set me up

10:59.821 --> 11:01.537
with her 70-year-old
grandmother.

11:01.539 --> 11:02.588
No...

11:02.590 --> 11:04.523
Yeah, yeah,
we dated for three months,

11:04.525 --> 11:05.875
and then, um...

11:05.877 --> 11:06.959
one day I showed up

11:06.961 --> 11:09.028
and she couldn't remember
who I was.

11:09.030 --> 11:10.630
So we dated another two months.

11:10.632 --> 11:12.364
And, um...

11:12.366 --> 11:13.916
every day was new again

11:13.918 --> 11:16.419
until finally I got tired
of introducing myself.

11:16.421 --> 11:18.137
Oh!

11:18.139 --> 11:19.388
But then six months later,

11:19.390 --> 11:21.574
she sent me a ten-dollar check
on my birthday.

11:22.894 --> 11:24.644
Hello?

11:26.430 --> 11:29.214
Jake?

11:29.216 --> 11:31.317
Hey!

11:31.319 --> 11:32.551
What are you
doing here?

11:32.553 --> 11:34.437
I got a weekend pass,
so I took a train in

11:34.439 --> 11:35.554
to surprise you guys.

11:35.556 --> 11:36.856
Hi, soldier!

11:36.858 --> 11:37.990
Hello.

11:37.992 --> 11:39.158
You must be Jake.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.526
I'm sleeping in your room.

11:40.528 --> 11:43.696
Well, God bless America.

11:44.898 --> 11:47.199
♪ <i>Men.</i> ♪

11:55.155 --> 11:57.707
It is so nice to meet you.
I'm Missi.

11:57.709 --> 11:59.225
Short for Mississippi,
not Melissa.

11:59.227 --> 12:01.594
She got stung by
a jellyfish and peed-on.

12:01.596 --> 12:03.095
Thank you.

12:03.097 --> 12:05.765
Are you, like, one of those
Navy SEAL guys?

12:05.767 --> 12:07.099
They are so awesome.

12:07.101 --> 12:08.451
No, I'm just a cook.

12:08.453 --> 12:10.019
Well, that's cool, too.

12:10.021 --> 12:11.670
Without food, everybody dies.

12:11.672 --> 12:12.855
That's so...
This one time, I found this

12:12.857 --> 12:14.457
little baby bird
that fell out of a tree

12:14.459 --> 12:16.692
and landed in my backyard
and he was almost dead.

12:16.694 --> 12:18.444
So I started feeding him
with this little eyedropper

12:18.446 --> 12:21.314
full of warm milk. "Eat
little bird, eat little bird."

12:21.316 --> 12:22.865
And eat he did.
Within a week,

12:22.867 --> 12:25.568
I was chewing up crackers and
spitting 'em right in his mouth.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.703
And when he finally had enough
strength to fly on his own,

12:27.705 --> 12:29.488
I opened up that box
and set him free.

12:29.490 --> 12:30.790
No kidding.
It was one

12:30.792 --> 12:32.908
of the most beautiful things
I had ever seen.

12:32.910 --> 12:35.211
But he got about ten feet up
in the air

12:35.213 --> 12:37.196
before my cat launched himself
off that picnic table

12:37.198 --> 12:38.214
and caught him right in midair.

12:38.216 --> 12:39.665
I mean, he didn't even
have to chew--

12:39.667 --> 12:41.367
just one gulp
and that bird was gone.

12:41.369 --> 12:44.203
But... I didn't have to
feed Mr. Mittens that day.

12:44.205 --> 12:46.555
So I know how important food is.

12:47.424 --> 12:49.208
Thanks. Uh, if you're hungry,

12:49.210 --> 12:50.593
I could...
I would love something to eat!

12:50.595 --> 12:52.561
Oh. Okay.

12:54.214 --> 12:55.598
All right,
well, uh...

12:55.600 --> 12:57.066
welcome back!

12:57.901 --> 12:59.885
Good catching up.

12:59.887 --> 13:01.187
That was like

13:01.189 --> 13:04.273
being there the first time
Beavis met Butthead.

13:04.275 --> 13:07.276
Wait till Beavis sees Butthead
in a bikini.

13:07.278 --> 13:11.197
God. You remember falling
that hard and fast for a girl?

13:11.199 --> 13:12.832
I remember the fast part.

13:12.834 --> 13:15.501
Kind of a relief those
days are behind us, huh?

13:15.503 --> 13:17.536
Behind you.

13:17.538 --> 13:19.288
These are my days.

13:19.290 --> 13:22.124
Oh, no, I wasn't saying...
No, I am young, Alan.

13:22.126 --> 13:23.592
I am young!

13:23.594 --> 13:25.244
Fine, fine, you're young.

13:25.246 --> 13:26.712
Where you going?

13:27.714 --> 13:30.916
I don't remember.

13:34.171 --> 13:36.722
Mmm. Kid makes
good chili.

13:36.724 --> 13:38.357
Glad you like it.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.092
We have enough...

13:40.094 --> 13:42.261
for a month.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.814
Why?

13:44.816 --> 13:46.365
The recipe was
for a platoon,

13:46.367 --> 13:49.485
and math is not his strong suit.

13:49.487 --> 13:51.620
Where'd he take "Oh, my God,
this place is beautiful.

13:51.622 --> 13:54.073
"Does that ocean go all the way
to Hawaii? I love Hawaii.

13:54.075 --> 13:56.992
You know 'aloha' means
'hello' and 'good-bye'"?

13:57.794 --> 13:59.462
They went for a walk
on the beach,

13:59.464 --> 14:01.047
which, you know,
has more grains of sand

14:01.049 --> 14:02.614
than there are stars
in the entire Milky Way.

14:02.616 --> 14:04.450
Speaking of which, do you like
Snickers or Milky Way?

14:04.452 --> 14:05.885
I like Three Musketeers.

14:07.087 --> 14:09.088
Even though I don't know
what nougat is.

14:13.226 --> 14:14.165
Hey, what you doing?

14:14.190 --> 14:15.771
Missi and I are hanging out
on the beach.

14:16.130 --> 14:17.847
Am I gonna see you at all
while you're home?

14:17.849 --> 14:20.099
Oh, uh-huh, yeah, sure.

14:20.101 --> 14:22.017
You're never gonna see him.

14:22.019 --> 14:23.152
Hey, Missi told me

14:23.154 --> 14:24.820
she's trying to set you up
with her mom.

14:24.822 --> 14:25.971
How cool would that be?

14:25.973 --> 14:27.990
If you married her mom
and I married Missi,

14:27.992 --> 14:29.508
you'd be my stepdad.

14:29.510 --> 14:31.360
Yeah, really cool.

14:31.362 --> 14:33.579
All right. See you later, Dad.

14:33.581 --> 14:35.748
And Dad.

14:37.650 --> 14:40.119
You know, if they have kids,
we'd be their grandpappies.

14:40.121 --> 14:42.321
Ow!

14:45.092 --> 14:46.492
Well, to make
a long story short,

14:46.494 --> 14:48.210
I ate all the wafers,
which is why

14:48.212 --> 14:50.496
you should never smoke pot
before you go to church.

14:50.498 --> 14:52.965
That's funny. This one
time, me and my friend...

14:52.967 --> 14:54.800
Do you want
to hear a joke?

14:54.802 --> 14:55.768
Sure.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.970
What do gay horse eat?
What?

14:57.972 --> 14:59.772
Haaaaay!

14:59.774 --> 15:01.891
Can I ask you something?

15:01.893 --> 15:03.726
Any...
Do you think I talk too much?

15:03.728 --> 15:05.728
No, I love listening
to you talk.

15:05.730 --> 15:07.613
I mean, it's funny. Normally...
You are just

15:07.615 --> 15:08.614
so sweet.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.032
I swear I could
just eat you up,

15:10.034 --> 15:11.617
but, you know, then I'd
probably get a sugar rush,

15:11.619 --> 15:12.985
'cause you are just so sweet,
and if you think

15:12.987 --> 15:15.404
I talk a lot now, you should
really hear me after I...

15:17.124 --> 15:18.624
Well, I am definitely
gonna shut up now,

15:18.626 --> 15:19.742
'cause you're
a really good kisser,

15:19.744 --> 15:21.160
and the last thing
I want to do is...

15:27.335 --> 15:29.468
Look at you
making breakfast.

15:29.470 --> 15:30.753
It's what the army
trains you to do

15:30.755 --> 15:33.139
when you keep
dropping a loaded gun.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.757
Here, have a cup of coffee.

15:34.759 --> 15:35.641
Oh, thank you.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.426
You want to hear a joke?
Sure.

15:37.428 --> 15:38.761
What do gay horses eat?

15:38.763 --> 15:39.395
Mm...

15:39.397 --> 15:40.930
Hay.

15:42.000 --> 15:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:52.359 --> 15:55.027
So, uh, when do you leave
for the base?

15:55.029 --> 15:56.779
Oh, my train leaves at 4:00.

15:56.781 --> 15:58.897
Mm. I'll give you a ride
to the station.

15:58.899 --> 16:00.032
Thanks.

16:00.034 --> 16:01.500
Are you kidding?
It's the only time

16:01.502 --> 16:03.002
I'm gonna get
to spend with you.

16:03.004 --> 16:05.204
So, uh, how was sleeping
on that couch last night?

16:06.239 --> 16:09.208
Oh, you know, it was
a little lumpy, but...

16:09.210 --> 16:11.126
better than sleeping
with 60 guys

16:11.128 --> 16:15.130
coughing, farting, and getting
all romantic with themselves.

16:15.966 --> 16:17.916
Missi still sleeping?

16:17.918 --> 16:20.019
No, she's in the shower.

16:23.273 --> 16:25.224
Oops.

16:26.092 --> 16:27.226
No, it's fine.

16:27.228 --> 16:29.111
Sh-She seems
like a nice girl.

16:29.113 --> 16:30.729
You have no idea.

16:32.932 --> 16:34.366
Well, if you'll
excuse me,

16:34.368 --> 16:36.385
I'm gonna take her some breakfast.
Mm.

16:36.387 --> 16:39.488
As you can imagine,
we worked up quite the appetite.

16:39.490 --> 16:40.789
Right.

16:43.460 --> 16:45.911
And... when I say
"worked up an appetite,"

16:45.913 --> 16:49.131
you understand...
I got it, I got it.

16:51.167 --> 16:54.637
I really loved hanging out
with you this weekend.

16:55.472 --> 16:57.640
Cool.

16:57.642 --> 16:59.225
Uh... yeah.

16:59.227 --> 17:01.594
So, listen, I get another pass
in, like, a month,

17:01.596 --> 17:03.429
so maybe we can see
each other then.

17:03.431 --> 17:05.263
Maybe.

17:05.266 --> 17:07.299
Are... you feeling all right?

17:07.300 --> 17:08.634
You're awful quiet.

17:08.636 --> 17:11.436
Well, here's the thing, Jake.

17:11.439 --> 17:14.522
Hang on, Dad!
There's a thing!

17:14.525 --> 17:15.907
What's the thing?

17:16.742 --> 17:18.694
I sort of have a boyfriend.

17:18.695 --> 17:20.162
A boyfriend?

17:20.164 --> 17:22.080
Well, technically we broke up

17:22.083 --> 17:23.249
because I was tired of him

17:23.251 --> 17:24.532
always putting his career
ahead of me.

17:24.535 --> 17:25.701
He's a doctor.

17:25.703 --> 17:27.836
Well, not a real doctor,
a glass doctor.

17:27.838 --> 17:29.655
You know, like if you get
a crack in your windshield,

17:29.657 --> 17:31.257
he will come right
to your driveway and fix it

17:31.259 --> 17:32.758
in less than half an hour,
guaranteed.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.009
So...

17:34.011 --> 17:35.827
Anyway, he sent me
this e-mail this morning

17:35.829 --> 17:38.180
saying that he wants
to try things again, but...

17:38.182 --> 17:40.766
now I really like you.
It's just that...

17:40.768 --> 17:43.385
Zach and I have been together
for, like, six months,

17:43.387 --> 17:45.437
and we even went
to a wedding together.

17:45.439 --> 17:47.523
I can't just throw that away.

17:48.358 --> 17:50.476
But, I thought you...

17:52.062 --> 17:53.312
Good-bye, Jake.

17:55.482 --> 17:57.816
Don't be a hero.

18:03.156 --> 18:05.691
What the hell just happened?

18:05.693 --> 18:07.626
♪ <i>Men. ♪</i>

18:16.217 --> 18:18.769
You and Missi make plans
to see each other again?

18:18.771 --> 18:20.504
No.

18:20.506 --> 18:22.239
Why? I-I thought
you two were, uh...

18:22.241 --> 18:24.674
I thought so, too.

18:24.676 --> 18:26.860
Oh.

18:28.813 --> 18:30.180
If it helps...

18:30.182 --> 18:32.349
It doesn't.

18:33.201 --> 18:35.402
Okay. Okay.

18:37.739 --> 18:39.289
I remember
my first...

18:39.291 --> 18:40.958
Dad.

18:40.960 --> 18:43.160
Gotcha.

18:46.864 --> 18:48.549
Does it get any easier?

18:48.551 --> 18:50.134
Oh, God, no.

18:50.136 --> 18:53.303
But... the human mind
is a wonderful thing.

18:53.305 --> 18:55.472
It forgets pain, so you can...

18:55.474 --> 18:58.342
go out and get some more.

18:59.177 --> 19:01.044
She has a boyfriend
back home.

19:01.046 --> 19:03.713
A doctor.

19:03.715 --> 19:06.517
How am I supposed
to compete with that?

19:06.519 --> 19:08.652
Let me ask you something, Jake.

19:08.654 --> 19:10.487
Knowing what you know now,

19:10.489 --> 19:12.406
and feeling how you feel now,

19:12.408 --> 19:14.658
would you have done anything
differently?

19:15.493 --> 19:16.777
No.

19:16.779 --> 19:19.613
I just would've done it
a few more times.

19:20.448 --> 19:22.699
There you go.

19:22.701 --> 19:24.952
That's what
love's all about.

19:28.573 --> 19:29.756
Hey.

19:29.758 --> 19:31.427
So, I just got off
the phone with my mom.

19:31.452 --> 19:32.594
Oh, yeah?

19:32.595 --> 19:35.179
She's really looking forward
to hearing from you.

19:36.632 --> 19:38.715
Gee, I-I don't know, Missi.

19:38.717 --> 19:40.717
I'm... I'm not sure
it's a good idea.

19:40.719 --> 19:43.387
I mean, I know your mom and dad
aren't together anymore,

19:43.389 --> 19:45.255
but your dad's an
old friend and...

19:45.257 --> 19:46.940
Here's a recent
picture of her.

19:51.813 --> 19:54.731
Then again, I haven't
seen him in years. I...

19:54.733 --> 19:56.950
Great. I'll go tell her
that you're gonna call.

19:56.952 --> 19:59.101
Hey, wait. Wait
a second. I...

19:59.103 --> 20:00.620
Yeah?

20:00.622 --> 20:04.324
I'm flattered that you think
I'd be good for your mom,

20:04.326 --> 20:06.108
but I was just curious

20:06.110 --> 20:10.380
at any point in time,
did you think that...

20:10.382 --> 20:12.715
maybe you and me...?

20:12.717 --> 20:14.133
Ew.

20:18.789 --> 20:20.306
A simple "no" would suffice.
