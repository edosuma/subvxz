00:29.040 --> 00:30.560
Ha ha ha!

00:32.439 --> 00:35.280
Hey, come back here,
little toad.

00:35.280 --> 00:37.040
Hey!

00:37.040 --> 00:39.000
Grab him!

00:39.000 --> 00:41.400
Yo! Slow down,
chief!

00:41.400 --> 00:42.760
He stole my ankh.

00:42.760 --> 00:43.760
Your what?

00:43.760 --> 00:44.800
My ankh.

00:44.800 --> 00:46.240
What's an ankh?

00:46.240 --> 00:49.040
Back off, Godzilla,
and I'll show you!

00:52.400 --> 00:53.360
That's it.

00:53.360 --> 00:55.520
I need it
for my story!

00:55.520 --> 00:58.000
You stole it out of
my private drawer!

00:58.000 --> 00:59.560
Stop! Stop!

01:01.080 --> 01:02.440
Thank you.

01:02.440 --> 01:05.160
Now, why did you
take... what is it?

01:05.160 --> 01:07.160
It's an ankh.

01:07.160 --> 01:09.400
You should have asked.
You're always taking my stuff.

01:09.400 --> 01:10.920
Tucker, ask him.

01:10.920 --> 01:13.640
Can I borrow
your ankh?

01:15.440 --> 01:17.600
Don't make this
any harder.

01:17.600 --> 01:18.920
Oh...

01:18.920 --> 01:20.920
All right.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.160
Thank you.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.360
I need the ankh

01:29.360 --> 01:31.920
because it's an ancient symbol
everybody knows.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.360
It means life.

01:33.360 --> 01:35.560
My story's
full of ancient symbols,

01:35.560 --> 01:39.400
but you have to know
how to read them.

01:39.400 --> 01:40.920
Like the ankh...

01:40.920 --> 01:43.320
It means life,
and that's good,

01:43.320 --> 01:45.720
but you have to
be careful

01:45.720 --> 01:48.600
because sometimes life
could be far worse

01:48.600 --> 01:50.600
than anything
you could imagine...

01:52.000 --> 01:54.280
Including death.

01:54.280 --> 01:57.920
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society,

01:57.920 --> 01:59.760
I call this story...

02:32.400 --> 02:34.400
Back up! Back up!

02:38.400 --> 02:41.280
Less than 1/4" to the left.

02:54.320 --> 02:55.840
Hold it.

02:55.840 --> 02:57.320
Right through here.

02:57.320 --> 02:59.720
That's where
it's supposed to go.

03:01.840 --> 03:03.840
You're right.

03:03.840 --> 03:06.400
There's not supposed
to be a wall here.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.000
What is that thing?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.600
Sweet mother
of Pearl!

03:30.240 --> 03:34.200
Yeah, looks like it's
from Egypt or something,

03:34.200 --> 03:35.800
some kind of tomb.

03:38.680 --> 03:40.600
Ain't these things
supposed to have

03:40.600 --> 03:43.040
curses on them
or something, huh?

03:43.040 --> 03:46.840
Get out of here. You
watch too many movies.

03:51.680 --> 03:54.760
I think we better
call someone on this.

04:20.760 --> 04:24.160
Funny, it doesn't look
like mount snowbird to me.

04:24.160 --> 04:27.160
Where do we buy
our lift tickets?

04:27.160 --> 04:28.720
Five minutes,
no more.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.120
Dad, we're really
going this time, right?

04:33.120 --> 04:34.560
No last-minute
emergencies?

04:34.560 --> 04:36.000
Just a quick peek,

04:36.000 --> 04:38.120
then we're off
to the mountains

04:38.120 --> 04:39.840
for a whole week--
promise.

04:39.840 --> 04:41.760
He lies.

04:45.240 --> 04:49.120
[Tucker] Josh and Cleo Dugan's
mom died when they were little,

04:49.120 --> 04:52.600
so they were brought up
by their dad, the professor.

04:52.600 --> 04:53.960
Don't touch it!

04:53.960 --> 04:56.360
He tried hard
to be a good father,

04:56.360 --> 04:58.800
but unfortunately, he knew
more about ancient stuff

04:58.800 --> 05:00.840
than about taking care
of kids.

05:05.160 --> 05:06.760
Professor Dugan!
Professor Dugan!

05:06.760 --> 05:09.280
This is amazing!
In all my years--

05:09.280 --> 05:10.920
I'm on vacation,
Dr. Capel-Smith.

05:10.920 --> 05:12.600
Five minutes,
and I'm gone.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.280
I believe
you'll think twice

05:14.280 --> 05:16.360
when you see
what we've got.

05:16.360 --> 05:19.280
Vacations come and go,
but a find like this

05:19.280 --> 05:20.960
happens
once in a lifetime.

05:20.960 --> 05:23.480
And it was here
all the time,

05:23.480 --> 05:25.520
right under
our noses!

05:33.160 --> 05:35.840
[Professor Dugan] My god.
Where did you find it?

05:35.840 --> 05:38.840
It was hidden
behind a false wall.

05:38.840 --> 05:41.840
Must have been sealed
there for decades.

05:41.840 --> 05:44.040
Unless I'm mistaken,
it's--it's...

05:45.240 --> 05:47.960
It's from the Egyptian
temple of light

05:47.960 --> 05:49.560
that was robbed
in 1921.

05:49.560 --> 05:51.880
Uh... yes, quite.

05:53.440 --> 05:56.840
We have to get this
to my lab now.

05:56.840 --> 05:58.440
Ha ha ha!

06:01.080 --> 06:03.400
[Cleo] You know what
this means, right?

06:03.400 --> 06:05.000
Yeah.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.000
No vacation,
no skiing...

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
No life.

06:19.600 --> 06:23.000
I'll create an entire
Egyptian exhibit around it.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.520
The publicity alone

06:24.520 --> 06:27.280
will increase donations
to the museum tenfold.

06:27.280 --> 06:31.000
Another vacation trashed.

06:33.080 --> 06:36.240
"August 21, 1921.

06:36.240 --> 06:38.920
"The archaeological community
was shocked to discover

06:38.920 --> 06:41.600
"that the newly unearthed
temple of light

06:41.600 --> 06:45.200
was ransacked last evening with most
of its ancient treasures stolen."

06:45.200 --> 06:46.640
The Egyptian
authorities

06:46.640 --> 06:48.560
are going to go
ballistic

06:48.560 --> 06:50.320
when they find out

06:50.320 --> 06:53.200
it's been in the
museum all this time.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.120
Mina
the guardian...

06:56.560 --> 06:58.360
And we've
got her.

06:58.360 --> 06:59.760
Who?

06:59.760 --> 07:02.560
Mina was a goddess. The
ancient Egyptians believed

07:02.560 --> 07:05.040
that she used
her ring of eternity

07:05.040 --> 07:07.920
to bring forth life from
the earth every spring.

07:07.920 --> 07:10.360
She should have used
the ring on herself.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.920
Maybe she wouldn't be
stuck in this old box.

07:12.920 --> 07:15.720
[Capel-Smith] But there was
two sides to the legend.

07:15.720 --> 07:18.440
Mina was beneficent
but vindictive.

07:18.440 --> 07:20.920
She supposedly
had the power

07:20.920 --> 07:23.160
to turn her enemies
into stone.

07:23.160 --> 07:24.680
[Thud]

07:24.680 --> 07:25.920
Got it.

07:25.920 --> 07:27.520
You sure about this?

07:28.840 --> 07:30.120
Yeah.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.880
[Professor Dugan] All
right. Help me, quickly.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.440
Careful.

07:34.440 --> 07:36.200
Careful.

07:43.360 --> 07:45.120
Yuck!

07:45.120 --> 07:47.080
Cool!

07:47.080 --> 07:49.080
Magnificent!

07:49.080 --> 07:52.600
[Professor Dugan] There she is--
Mina the guardian.

08:01.600 --> 08:02.680
Don't feed him.

08:02.680 --> 08:04.920
Maybe we can starve
him out of there.

08:04.920 --> 08:06.080
I doubt it.

08:06.080 --> 08:08.360
Just because he
doesn't have a life

08:08.360 --> 08:10.240
doesn't mean
he can ruin ours.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.800
It's important.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.280
It's, like,
historic.

08:13.280 --> 08:16.080
Oh, yeah. Like
the important monkey bone

08:16.080 --> 08:18.440
that nuked our vacation
last year

08:18.440 --> 08:21.720
or the time he left us
alone for Christmas

08:21.720 --> 08:24.560
to see some old pot
somebody dug up.

08:24.560 --> 08:27.400
What can I say?
He lives to work.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.880
He needs it.

08:28.880 --> 08:32.320
What he needs
is a girlfriend.

08:32.320 --> 08:35.159
Chow time.

08:35.159 --> 08:36.840
Cleo, look at this.

08:36.840 --> 08:39.320
I managed to translate
some markings

08:39.320 --> 08:40.799
on the sarcophagus.

08:40.799 --> 08:43.679
Apparently there were blood
sacrifices made to Mina

08:43.679 --> 08:45.600
to ensure
a fruitful harvest.

08:45.600 --> 08:46.840
Yuck.

08:46.840 --> 08:49.480
Then I found this.
Uh...

08:49.480 --> 08:50.720
Yes.

08:51.960 --> 08:54.560
The legend...
Of the ring of eternity

08:54.560 --> 08:56.040
was widely known,

08:56.040 --> 08:58.400
but there's
also mention

08:58.400 --> 09:00.600
of an elixir
of life.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.800
See, the elixir
brings life,

09:02.800 --> 09:04.800
the ring
brings eternity.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.400
[Sarcastically] Wow!
I'm totally blown away.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.960
There's also mention
of a curse.

09:09.960 --> 09:11.400
Really?

09:11.400 --> 09:13.840
The guardian's curse
-- that was fairly standard--

09:13.840 --> 09:15.520
but the ancients
always threatened

09:15.520 --> 09:16.960
horrible death
and torture

09:16.960 --> 09:19.040
to those who
disturbed their tombs.

09:19.040 --> 09:22.640
Which is exactly what
we did. That's... swell!

09:22.640 --> 09:25.960
I need you guys to
get back to the museum

09:25.960 --> 09:28.480
and pick up
that new set of photos.

09:28.480 --> 09:32.320
My extra set of keys
are in the kitchen.

09:32.320 --> 09:35.640
Uh, Dad, does this officially
mean the vacation's off?

09:35.640 --> 09:36.640
Hmm?

09:37.760 --> 09:39.160
Bingo.

09:39.160 --> 09:41.120
We'll get
the pictures.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.280
Josh, Cleo...

09:47.920 --> 09:51.320
I--I'm sorry, kids.
It's just that...

09:53.040 --> 09:56.120
It's OK, Dad.
We know.

10:14.920 --> 10:17.280
[Cleo] Give him a
break, would you?

10:17.280 --> 10:19.680
<i>[Josh] Why? He doesn't
give us any breaks.</i>

10:19.680 --> 10:22.520
We only get a couple of
school vacations a year,

10:22.520 --> 10:24.960
and we get dumped on
because of...

10:24.960 --> 10:26.280
That.

10:26.280 --> 10:27.760
Yuck!

10:27.760 --> 10:29.440
It's his work, Josh.

10:29.440 --> 10:31.760
And what about us? I
mean, we don't rate?

10:31.760 --> 10:34.680
We're here. We're alive.
I mean, that thing is...

10:34.680 --> 10:38.240
I don't know what that thing
is, but it's really gross.

10:38.240 --> 10:41.000
We'll go skiing
next time.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.840
Next time
is all we ever get.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.000
[Kicks tomb]

10:46.000 --> 10:47.160
Oops.

10:50.840 --> 10:52.840
I can't believe
he missed this.

10:52.840 --> 10:55.640
Don't touch it.
There's a curse.

11:11.640 --> 11:14.320
It's an ankh...
The symbol of life.

11:14.320 --> 11:16.640
Oh, we've got to
show Dad.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.160
I'd better
carry this.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.800
I can take it.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.640
Well, it's safer
with me.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.680
I can do it, Josh!

11:24.920 --> 11:26.680
Gross.

11:26.680 --> 11:29.480
I'm not
picking it up.

11:30.840 --> 11:33.760
You take the ring.
I'll take the vial.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.480
Don't drop it.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.000
I found these,
right?

11:55.000 --> 11:57.480
When the names
go in the paper,

11:57.480 --> 11:59.160
remember, I made
the discovery.

11:59.160 --> 12:01.680
Oh, wait. We forgot
the pictures.

12:07.160 --> 12:10.160
I could, like,
go down in history.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.600
Babes love fame.
I could...

12:12.600 --> 12:14.480
[Papers rustling]

12:16.680 --> 12:18.120
Cleo?

12:18.120 --> 12:19.560
What?

12:19.560 --> 12:21.640
Cleo?

12:21.640 --> 12:23.680
What are you...

12:54.440 --> 12:56.640
Dad! Dad! We found
the ring of...

12:56.640 --> 12:58.080
Eternity.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.880
[Josh]
Uh-oh.

13:01.880 --> 13:03.480
Dad?

13:03.480 --> 13:04.480
Dad!

13:05.360 --> 13:07.280
[Telephone beeping]

13:07.280 --> 13:09.360
What happened?

13:15.520 --> 13:17.280
[Hangs up telephone]

13:19.800 --> 13:23.160
"I've got to go
to the museum after all.

13:23.160 --> 13:25.160
Sorry.
I love you-- Dad."

13:25.160 --> 13:27.880
He must have split
before all this happened.

13:27.880 --> 13:29.440
[Object shatters]

13:30.960 --> 13:32.880
What was that?

13:32.880 --> 13:34.200
[Footsteps]

13:36.720 --> 13:38.760
Somebody's out there.

13:40.760 --> 13:43.360
You don't think
it was the...

13:47.440 --> 13:50.080
Go away!
Leave us alone!

13:51.440 --> 13:53.400
We got to get Dad!

13:53.400 --> 13:55.040
The window!

14:05.960 --> 14:07.400
Dad! Dad!

14:07.400 --> 14:10.880
He's not here. It's the
curse. It's the curse!

14:10.880 --> 14:13.880
Get out of here.
That stuff is made up.

14:13.880 --> 14:16.400
Oh, yeah? Does this
look made up to you?

14:16.400 --> 14:19.000
It's real, Cleo, just
like the legend said.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.400
No way!

14:20.400 --> 14:22.960
What about that bottle
you're carrying around?

14:22.960 --> 14:25.600
That's real, too! And
where's the mummy?

14:25.600 --> 14:27.320
I don't believe it!

14:27.320 --> 14:29.400
No? It's gone, Cleo!

14:29.400 --> 14:31.000
What are you saying?

14:31.000 --> 14:34.880
That a 10,000-year-old mummy
just hopped off the table and--

14:34.880 --> 14:36.240
[thud]

14:48.240 --> 14:49.680
Yeah.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.920
That's exactly
what I'm saying.

15:05.360 --> 15:07.800
We'll lose it
in the basement.

15:07.800 --> 15:10.800
<i>Forget it. We'll
get lost down here.</i>

15:10.800 --> 15:12.800
Now what?

15:12.800 --> 15:15.800
There's a fire exit
on the other side.

15:17.680 --> 15:20.120
What's
that nasty smell?

15:29.800 --> 15:32.240
I--I think we've
got to turn...

15:32.240 --> 15:33.720
Aah!
Aah!

15:33.720 --> 15:36.360
Oh, wait. Wait.

15:36.360 --> 15:38.600
It's just stuffy.

15:40.400 --> 15:41.880
Come on.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.440
There.

15:57.520 --> 15:58.880
Yes.

16:02.280 --> 16:03.760
It's locked.

16:04.880 --> 16:07.640
How can they lock
a fire door?

16:07.640 --> 16:09.520
Oh, what
is that smell?

16:09.520 --> 16:12.320
[Footsteps]

16:20.880 --> 16:23.600
I'm going for the stairs.

16:25.360 --> 16:26.640
No!

16:26.640 --> 16:28.440
It jammed the door.

16:30.160 --> 16:31.640
We're trapped.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.040
Aah!

16:33.040 --> 16:34.120
Dad!

16:38.240 --> 16:40.200
Dad, are you OK?

16:40.200 --> 16:42.400
Oh... I think so.

16:43.720 --> 16:44.680
What...
is going on?

16:48.680 --> 16:50.200
[Thud]

16:52.400 --> 16:55.600
I think you're about
to see for yourself.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.600
Dr. Capel-Smith?

17:01.880 --> 17:04.359
Look out! The
mummy's on the loose.

17:04.359 --> 17:07.000
Ha ha!
I don't think so.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.520
What exactly is
going on, doctor?

17:09.520 --> 17:12.400
Your children have
something I want.

17:12.400 --> 17:13.800
What?

17:13.800 --> 17:16.400
I don't
understand.

17:16.400 --> 17:19.400
Well, then you're not
as astute as I thought.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.520
I want the ring
of eternity.

17:21.520 --> 17:23.640
I didn't
find the ring.

17:23.640 --> 17:26.839
No, but
your children did.

17:26.839 --> 17:29.360
I thought you had discovered
the ring, professor,

17:29.360 --> 17:32.880
and I wasn't about
to let it be claimed

17:32.880 --> 17:34.560
by the Egyptian
authorities

17:34.560 --> 17:37.840
when it was
so near my grasp...

17:37.840 --> 17:40.160
So I searched
your home.

17:45.160 --> 17:48.080
Dad! Dad! We found
the ring of...

17:48.080 --> 17:49.560
Eternity.

17:49.560 --> 17:51.480
Uh-oh.

17:51.480 --> 17:53.080
Dad!

17:54.400 --> 17:57.320
[Dr. Capel-Smith]
As it turns out,

17:57.320 --> 18:00.240
<i>your children are
more clever than you.</i>

18:00.240 --> 18:03.320
"I've got to go
to the museum after all.

18:03.320 --> 18:05.120
Sorry.
I love you-- Dad."

18:05.120 --> 18:07.120
Knowing your plans,

18:07.120 --> 18:11.880
I hurried back here
before your children arrived.

18:14.640 --> 18:17.080
And so
now here we stand.

18:17.080 --> 18:19.920
Now, if you would
be so kind

18:19.920 --> 18:22.120
as to hand me
that ring.

18:22.120 --> 18:24.080
You're not
thinking--

18:24.080 --> 18:28.080
Oh, yes. I intend to use
that ring for myself.

18:28.080 --> 18:30.080
Now give it to me!

18:30.080 --> 18:32.480
I wouldn't if I
were you, professor.

18:32.480 --> 18:34.960
That odor you smell
is kerosene.

18:34.960 --> 18:37.560
I've soaked most
of these crates.

18:37.560 --> 18:39.840
One touch
of this torch,

18:39.840 --> 18:42.720
and this museum
becomes a furnace.

18:42.720 --> 18:44.680
You
wouldn't.

18:44.680 --> 18:47.000
You want to take
that risk?

18:47.000 --> 18:49.640
I say we give it
to him.

18:49.640 --> 18:51.080
I have to think.

18:51.080 --> 18:53.360
There's nothing to think
about. We've got to do it.

18:53.360 --> 18:55.040
Josh, give him
the ring.

18:55.040 --> 18:57.200
But what about--

18:57.200 --> 18:59.440
Just give him
the ring, understand?

19:02.760 --> 19:04.560
Good boy.

19:04.560 --> 19:07.240
Now, slide it
over here.

19:07.240 --> 19:08.840
Come on.
Come on!

19:12.960 --> 19:15.040
Now
let them go.

19:15.040 --> 19:18.320
I'm afraid I can't
do that, professor.

19:18.320 --> 19:21.160
I'm sure you'd go right
to the authorities,

19:21.160 --> 19:23.480
and I can't have
them tracking me

19:23.480 --> 19:25.760
for the rest of
eternity, now, can I?

19:25.760 --> 19:27.840
Don't do it,
doctor. Please.

19:27.840 --> 19:30.280
At least let us see
if the ring works.

19:32.520 --> 19:34.120
Why not?

19:53.280 --> 19:55.200
It's...

19:55.200 --> 19:57.520
It's wonderful.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.960
Behold, you are now
gazing at...

20:04.960 --> 20:06.960
An immortal.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.360
Ha ha ha!

20:11.360 --> 20:12.760
What's this?

20:14.840 --> 20:16.280
I...

20:16.280 --> 20:17.760
can't...

20:17.760 --> 20:19.880
move.

20:19.880 --> 20:21.640
Aah!

20:28.440 --> 20:29.800
Look out!

20:31.480 --> 20:34.200
Save! And a beauty.

20:41.960 --> 20:43.960
It's incredible.

20:46.720 --> 20:50.040
I guess he got
what he wanted after all--

20:50.040 --> 20:51.520
immortality.

20:51.520 --> 20:53.000
Very clever,
little sister.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
Excuse me?

20:55.000 --> 20:56.920
The translations--
they said,

20:56.920 --> 20:58.880
"the ring brings
eternity,

20:58.880 --> 21:00.840
the elixir
brings life."

21:00.840 --> 21:02.840
He knew
we had the ring,

21:02.840 --> 21:05.000
but he didn't know
we had this.

21:06.520 --> 21:08.400
The elixir.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.880
It's real.

21:09.880 --> 21:11.560
[Creaking]

21:15.480 --> 21:18.600
Um, we forgot
to tell you, Dad.

21:18.600 --> 21:20.160
The mummy's missing.

21:20.160 --> 21:21.640
What?

21:25.320 --> 21:27.080
My god,
it's alive.

21:34.720 --> 21:37.320
The elixir
brings life,

21:37.320 --> 21:39.480
the ring brings
eternity.

21:41.560 --> 21:43.840
Josh, don't!

22:08.960 --> 22:10.640
Mina.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.520
Mina?

22:42.680 --> 22:45.840
I wonder if she
likes to ski.

22:58.800 --> 23:02.840
So the true guardian's curse
was immortality...

23:04.760 --> 23:06.600
And Dr. Capel-Smith...

23:08.160 --> 23:10.280
was the final victim.

23:11.960 --> 23:13.400
The end.

23:15.800 --> 23:18.720
See? Wasn't that worth
letting him borrow it?

23:18.720 --> 23:22.120
I guess his story
was pretty good.

23:22.120 --> 23:25.480
Hey, the little toad
still has my ankh.

23:25.480 --> 23:26.320
Tucker!

23:29.080 --> 23:30.840
Here we go
again.
