00:09.640 --> 00:12.683
Yes, Siena,
I'll take good care of myself.

00:12.683 --> 00:15.086
I'm, uh,
having oatmeal right now.

00:15.086 --> 00:18.319
- [crunching]
- Why is it crunchy?

00:18.319 --> 00:24.225
Um, because I'm eating it
raw, the way nature intended.

00:24.225 --> 00:26.697
Hey, what the Sam heck
happened to the bacon?

00:26.697 --> 00:28.499
Dad!

00:28.499 --> 00:31.462
Um, he's talking
about Kevin Bacon,

00:31.462 --> 00:35.706
talented actor who brought
dance to a small town in
the classic movie Footloose.

00:35.706 --> 00:38.539
I'm talking about the bacon
that was right there.

00:38.539 --> 00:42.173
Uh, that's our name
for Kevin. "The Bacon."

00:42.173 --> 00:44.345

for a healthy...

00:44.345 --> 00:46.317
Yes, I'll eat better.

00:46.317 --> 00:48.719
I'm gonna go wake up the girls
and don't you even think

00:48.719 --> 00:51.482
about touching my
b-b-b-blueberry pancakes,

00:51.482 --> 00:53.584
I'll kick your
b-b-b-butt.

00:53.584 --> 00:56.056
- Aah!

00:56.056 --> 00:59.059
Wow, when you got rid
of Hannah, did she take
all your makeup with her?

00:59.059 --> 01:02.233
Nice try, but not
even you can bring me down.

01:02.233 --> 01:06.597
The secret's out. Yesterday,
I told Robin Roberts
that I'm really Miley Stewart,

01:06.597 --> 01:08.569
she told me that
America's gonna love me.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.341
And tomorrow I go
on Colin Lassiter,

01:10.341 --> 01:13.104
and I get to tell the world
that you're a snot wagon

01:13.104 --> 01:15.676

- Where is it?
- [whistling]

01:26.117 --> 01:29.390
- [makes explosion sound]
- It's all gone.

01:29.390 --> 01:31.592
- But I can bring it
back up for ya.
- Oh!

01:31.592 --> 01:34.795
- How do you have a girlfriend?
- [phone rings]

01:34.795 --> 01:38.169
- Got it.
- Oh, don't mind if I do.

01:38.169 --> 01:40.671
- Do what?
- Do this.

01:40.671 --> 01:42.333
Come on, there's
a fresh stack right there.

01:44.675 --> 01:47.107
Oh! Oh, yeah,
but these are pre-syruped.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.108
Oopsies!

01:49.710 --> 01:52.213

- Hey, Mile,

01:52.213 --> 01:54.645
there's a special delivery
for you down at the gate
from Stanford.

01:54.645 --> 01:57.288
- I got accepted!
- You got accepted!

01:57.288 --> 01:59.320
Yeah, hold on,
I'll buzz you in.

01:59.320 --> 02:02.122
Buzz him in?
Since when do you lock the gate?

02:02.122 --> 02:05.426
Well, honey, ever since
the secret got out, I thought
I better start doing that.

02:05.426 --> 02:08.459
- So, uh... Hm...
- You forgot the code,
didn't you?

02:08.459 --> 02:11.702
It's the first time
I've had to use it
since we moved in here.

02:11.702 --> 02:13.704
Well, I'm sure
he wrote it down somewhere.

02:13.704 --> 02:17.868
Thank you very much, Lilly.
Of course I did.
It's just a matter of...

02:17.868 --> 02:19.570

wrote it down, didn't you?

02:32.683 --> 02:36.357

- [Robby Ray]
Keep your pants on.

02:42.863 --> 02:44.735
I'm on the other line
with the gate company.

02:44.735 --> 02:46.697
- [cameras clicking]
- OK, I'm back.

02:46.697 --> 02:49.600
- Still me, Dad.
- Sorry, honey.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.802

- Grab on!

03:07.688 --> 03:10.661

You are at the top

05:20.621 --> 05:22.823
But this is gonna

down for you?

05:26.697 --> 05:28.098
It hasn't yet, has it?

05:28.098 --> 05:32.633
Well, it's only been 40 years.

a really good shot of that.

shrink-wrapped for nothin'.

06:20.611 --> 06:23.884
And, uh, then you can
just give me and my
family some privacy.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.786
We can do that, we'll
make this a regular thing.

06:25.786 --> 06:28.489
I'll even throw in a couple

It's Rico.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.582
He's been like this

07:31.582 --> 07:33.023
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

I mean, look.

He's been like this for hours.

07:45.596 --> 07:47.037
There's something
very wrong with him.

And you're just
discovering this now?

07:48.939 --> 07:51.802

some serious damage up there.

07:54.505 --> 07:57.107
She was Lola! Of course!

Miley was Hannah,

missed that, too?

and now you do this?

was tell the truth.
- A little late for that now!

How am I supposed to teach
my kid to be honest when her

you've done a wonderful

Hey, why don't you
come and be on my show
Saturday night?

11:14.775 --> 11:17.077
- Aunt Dolly,
that's a great idea.
- Yeah.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.849
Why don't I just wear
my bull's-eye costume

11:18.849 --> 11:23.453
so all the Miley-hating food
flingers have a nice big target!

11:23.453 --> 11:26.857
Hey, come on, Mile.
I know it was tough on you
out there today,

11:26.857 --> 11:29.890
but, to be honest, most of
those people that called in

11:29.890 --> 11:32.322
are a bunch of stopped-up
adults who probably don't have

11:32.322 --> 11:34.364
enough fiber in their diets.

11:35.826 --> 11:38.769
Yeah. Besides that,
those are not your fans anyway.

11:38.769 --> 11:42.232
Your fans are young people
with very healthy innards.

11:42.232 --> 11:45.135
Well, what if
they hate me, too?

11:45.135 --> 11:47.237
I just couldn't handle that.

11:47.237 --> 11:50.811
You telling me you're just gonna
let fear run your life? Ha!

11:50.811 --> 11:52.913
That ain't the
Miley Stewart I raised.

11:52.913 --> 11:56.817
You won't be by yourself.
I'm gonna be right there,
your daddy's gonna be there.

11:56.817 --> 11:59.950
- Heck, yeah!
- I bet you he'd get up
and sing with you.

11:59.950 --> 12:03.253
- Heck, no!
- Did you just "heck no" me?

12:03.253 --> 12:05.826
Heck, yeah.
I ain't getting up there.

12:05.826 --> 12:08.899
- Why in the world not?
- Let me tell you something.

12:08.899 --> 12:11.862
It's been almost ten years
since I've been on television.

12:11.862 --> 12:14.434

even remember me?

12:14.434 --> 12:16.837

12:16.837 --> 12:20.740
I don't need to get on
television and find out I'm
old news, thank you very much.

Oh, so you're just gonna
let fear run your life?

12:23.743 --> 12:26.947
Don't be throwing
my words back in my face,
little missy.

12:26.947 --> 12:29.219
So you're one of those "do
as I say, not as I do" daddies.

"do daddy" me, daughter.
