00:00.501 --> 00:05.004
Kara: <i> When I was a child,</i>
<i> my planet Krypton was dying.</i>

00:05.272 --> 00:08.540
<i> I was sent to earth</i>
<i> to protect my cousin.</i>

00:08.542 --> 00:10.509
<i> But my pod got</i>
<i> knocked off-course</i>

00:10.511 --> 00:12.311
<i> and by the time I got here,</i>

00:12.313 --> 00:16.515
<i> my cousin</i>
<i> had already grown up</i>
<i> and become superman.</i>

00:16.517 --> 00:18.384
<i> And so I hide my powers</i>

00:18.386 --> 00:22.955
<i> until recently</i>
<i> when an accident forced me</i>
<i> to reveal myself to the world.</i>

00:22.957 --> 00:26.158
<i> To most people</i>
<i> I'm an assistant</i>
<i> at catco worldwide media.</i>

00:26.160 --> 00:29.995
<i> But in secret, I work with my</i>
<i> adoptive sister for the deo</i>

00:29.997 --> 00:31.964
<i> to protect my city</i>
<i> from alien life</i>

00:31.966 --> 00:34.767
<i> and anyone else</i>
<i> that means to cause it harm.</i>

00:36.137 --> 00:38.504
<i> I am Supergirl.</i>

00:38.506 --> 00:40.172
Kara:
<i> Previously on</i> Supergirl...

00:40.174 --> 00:42.041
Maxwell: (On TV)
<i> Forget about Supergirl's</i>
<i> lack of experience,</i>

00:42.043 --> 00:43.809
<i> I'm talking about the trouble</i>
<i> she'll bring.</i>

00:43.811 --> 00:46.111
<i> National city does not need</i>
<i> Metropolis' problems.</i>

00:46.113 --> 00:48.147
-Who cares what that guy says?
-You do.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.648
Isn't Maxwell lord your hero?

00:49.650 --> 00:51.950
This train is a gift
for national city.

00:51.952 --> 00:54.953
What if people
figure out who you are?

00:54.955 --> 00:56.288
It's not safe.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.857
Supergirl should take
a page out of your book, Kara.

00:58.859 --> 01:01.360
She's taking on
way too much, way too fast.

01:01.362 --> 01:03.228
You like Jimmy Olsen,

01:03.230 --> 01:07.766
<i> who makes you smile</i>
<i> more than anyone else</i>
<i> I've ever seen.</i>

01:07.768 --> 01:09.701
Kara, this is Lucy Lane.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.937
Lois is my big sister.

01:11.939 --> 01:13.572
Lucy: <i> Jimmy, I came</i>
<i> a long way to see you.</i>

01:13.574 --> 01:14.873
And why did you?

01:14.875 --> 01:16.675
I didn't like the way
we ended things.

01:20.147 --> 01:23.549
Kara: <i> There was a time</i>
<i> when I felt like a shadow</i>
<i> of a person.</i>

01:23.551 --> 01:26.718
<i> But ever since I've been</i>
<i> able to show the world</i>
<i> what I can do,</i>

01:26.720 --> 01:29.088
<i> I feel like anything</i>
<i> is possible.</i>

01:29.090 --> 01:33.926
<i> And for once in my life,</i>
<i> I can finally have it all.</i>

01:33.928 --> 01:35.694
<i> But one thing I know for sure,</i>

01:35.696 --> 01:37.463
<i> nothing can ruin</i>
<i> my mood today.</i>

01:37.465 --> 01:39.231
(Horn blaring faintly)

02:06.727 --> 02:08.927
Thought I'd return
this to you.

02:08.929 --> 02:11.463
I thought we were clicking.

02:11.465 --> 02:12.731
Okay...

02:12.733 --> 02:15.334
People who click
don't spy on each other!

02:15.336 --> 02:17.035
I don't like being followed.

02:17.037 --> 02:19.838
If I were following you,
Ms. danvers, you would
never know about it.

02:19.840 --> 02:22.574
This is... not one of ours.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.042
Then whose is it?

02:25.312 --> 02:26.712
There's no markings.

02:28.115 --> 02:29.748
I've never seen
tech like this before...

02:29.750 --> 02:32.251
Alien origin?
Could be your aunt, astra.

02:32.253 --> 02:33.819
Alex: No,
it's definitely from earth,

02:33.821 --> 02:35.821
but it is incredibly advanced.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.657
Yeah, no kidding.
That thing was like trying to
SWAT a fly in a tornado.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.360
If someone's targeting
one of my assets,
I want to know who it is.

02:41.362 --> 02:42.161
We'll handle this.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.466
You can trust him, Kara.

02:47.468 --> 02:48.667
I hope you're right.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.302
(Phones ringing)

02:50.304 --> 02:52.304
Winn: (Stammers)
<i> Please don't yell at me,</i>
<i> this isn't my job.</i>

02:54.642 --> 02:56.341
Cat Grant's office,
this is Kara.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.877
Please, do not make me cover
phones for you ever again.

02:58.879 --> 03:01.713
She did? That's amazing!
Yeah...

03:01.715 --> 03:04.516
Yes. Yes, I will get right
back to you.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.519
Ms. Grant won the Siegel prize
for women in media!

03:07.521 --> 03:08.687
Oh, yeah, she already knows.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.322
I didn't know
that she could smile...

03:10.324 --> 03:12.324
If it wasn't based on
cruelty to others.

03:12.326 --> 03:15.093
The ceremony is in Metropolis
tomorrow night.

03:15.095 --> 03:17.496
I better book a plane
right away.

03:17.498 --> 03:20.265
Cat: <i> I didn't tell you</i>
<i> about it because I knew you</i>
<i> would have this reaction.</i>

03:20.267 --> 03:23.635
<i> I know you think it's</i>
<i> a stupid award, mother,</i>
<i> but I won it.</i>

03:24.572 --> 03:27.072
<i> I don't ask for very much.</i>

03:27.074 --> 03:28.807
<i> Oh, I'm sorry.</i>

03:28.809 --> 03:32.010
<i> I didn't realize</i>
<i> that it was such a burden</i>
<i> being a grandmother.</i>

03:32.813 --> 03:35.547
-(Sighs) Keira!
-Oh!

03:35.549 --> 03:37.683
-Yes.
-Get me a salad for lunch.

03:37.685 --> 03:40.886
I don't care what kind
as long as it has
a cheeseburger on top.

03:40.888 --> 03:44.056
And, may I say, Ms. Grant,
congratulations!

03:44.058 --> 03:45.924
The Siegel prize, that's huge.

03:45.926 --> 03:48.961
I hope not,
considering they're going
to have to mail it to me.

03:48.963 --> 03:50.762
I won't be attending
the ceremony.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.864
But this is the first year
you beat Lois Lane.

03:52.866 --> 03:56.835
And as much as I would love
to rub it in her annoyingly
freckled button nose,

03:56.837 --> 03:58.870
I don't have anyone
to watch Carter.

03:58.872 --> 04:02.207
-Did you fire another nanny?
-No.

04:02.209 --> 04:05.143
-Ella broke her leg
storing my summer sandals.
-And your mom?

04:05.145 --> 04:10.182
She is living down to my
expectations by prioritizing
her career over my own.

04:10.184 --> 04:12.784
Does your mother give a damn
about your career?

04:12.786 --> 04:15.387
Um, well,
she's not really around...

04:15.389 --> 04:18.190
Oh, salad. Burger, rare. Go.

04:23.130 --> 04:26.198
If you wanted, I could watch
Carter overnight.

04:28.636 --> 04:31.169
What do you want?

04:31.171 --> 04:34.473
You know how
sometimes people just want
to help other people?

04:34.475 --> 04:35.941
Oh, I see.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.143
So, you think that if you
do me this favor,

04:38.145 --> 04:40.646
that I will owe you something.

04:40.648 --> 04:44.149
Well, this is the first time
I've ever seen this quality
in you, Keira.

04:44.618 --> 04:45.684
I love it.

04:45.686 --> 04:46.885
(Chuckles)

04:46.887 --> 04:48.854
I didn't know
you had it in you.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.856
This award is important
to you.

04:50.858 --> 04:52.224
So, it's important to me.

04:52.226 --> 04:54.760
Maybe you will
get that promotion someday.

04:55.529 --> 04:56.962
(Sighs)

04:56.964 --> 04:59.865
My son, uh, Carter...

04:59.867 --> 05:03.535
He, um, well, he's not
a normal boy, thank god.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.904
He's clever and curious,

05:05.906 --> 05:09.975
and like most gifted children,
he can be...

05:09.977 --> 05:12.377
Shy and reserved.

05:12.379 --> 05:14.579
He needs special attention.

05:14.581 --> 05:16.281
Oh, do not worry, Ms. Grant.

05:16.283 --> 05:18.250
He wouldn't be safer
with Supergirl.

05:18.252 --> 05:19.384
Oh...

05:19.386 --> 05:21.219
Now, it's just annoying.

05:25.859 --> 05:28.960
Lucy: I hate doing awol cases,
and I'm prosecuting three
of them.

05:28.962 --> 05:31.029
I got into jag because
I care about the law of war,

05:31.031 --> 05:32.798
not punishing soldiers!

05:32.800 --> 05:34.499
Lucy, what are you doing here?

05:34.501 --> 05:36.635
I told you,
reviewing depositions
for a court martial.

05:36.637 --> 05:39.137
Which you could have had
emailed to you in Metropolis,
so...

05:39.139 --> 05:42.441
But then we wouldn't
have been able to share this
delicious chocolate thing.

05:42.443 --> 05:43.508
(Laughs)

05:44.778 --> 05:46.078
Lucy...

05:50.651 --> 05:53.819
Okay, I also missed you.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.854
Am I not allowed to miss you?

05:57.324 --> 05:59.958
(Stammering) I have to...
I have to go, uh...

05:59.960 --> 06:02.027
My boss is headed
out of town,

06:02.029 --> 06:05.163
and she's left me to run
point on digital marketing,
so, you know...

06:05.165 --> 06:08.233
Well, you always wanted
more responsibility.

06:08.235 --> 06:10.302
I wanted a lot of things,
Lucy.

06:11.472 --> 06:13.805
Jimmy, you were right.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.841
I didn't come here
for the case.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.509
I came here for you.

06:20.047 --> 06:24.249
Okay, well, um, I'll give you
a ring if I'm not too slammed
at work.

06:29.990 --> 06:33.125
That sounds like a woman
who knows what she wants.

06:33.127 --> 06:36.528
I used my regular hearing
on that.

06:37.798 --> 06:40.065
All that she wants is
to win everything.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.734
Win every case,
every argument.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.202
And now she wants to win me.

06:44.204 --> 06:46.438
Because you broke up with her?

06:48.876 --> 06:51.009
Uh... I moved away.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.245
After she dumped me.

06:53.247 --> 06:54.880
How did...

06:54.882 --> 06:57.082
(Laughing)
How is that even possible?

06:57.084 --> 06:59.584
She's obsessed
with her career.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.520
And I was a distraction.

07:03.357 --> 07:06.992
Well, you're... you're totally
not a distraction.

07:08.529 --> 07:09.761
(Rumbling)

07:09.763 --> 07:11.329
(Patrons exclaiming)

07:17.104 --> 07:19.070
-Earthquake?
-No, a bomb.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.239
(Bystanders screaming)

07:44.164 --> 07:45.964
(Pillars crumbling)

07:57.644 --> 07:59.110
(Crumbling stops)

08:03.684 --> 08:05.584
(Crowd cheering)

08:21.435 --> 08:26.404
You were supporting the weight
of 120 pounds per square foot,
multiplied by five floors.

08:26.406 --> 08:27.539
Not bad.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.841
Why would someone plant
a bomb in that building?

08:29.843 --> 08:31.109
What was in there?

08:31.111 --> 08:33.345
A lab developing a new,
non-lithium battery.

08:33.347 --> 08:34.246
Cutting edge.

08:34.248 --> 08:35.881
Could be industrial espionage.

08:35.883 --> 08:38.149
This might be one to let
the FBI handle.

08:38.151 --> 08:40.952
I don't think we want
to do that, sir.

08:40.954 --> 08:43.021
These are fragments
from the bomb.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.824
I found the exact same
technology inside the drone
Kara brought in yesterday.

08:45.826 --> 08:48.593
So whoever was spying on me
was also behind the bombing?

08:48.595 --> 08:49.694
Yes.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.196
And I think I may have a lead.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.037
-Maxwell lord?
-Yeah.

08:59.039 --> 09:03.041
Both the bomb and the drone
used an advanced
fiber optics relay system.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.342
It's not even
on the market yet.

09:04.344 --> 09:07.178
And it was developed by
lord technologies.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.314
Let's pay Maxwell lord
a visit.

09:09.316 --> 09:13.318
How? You can't just walk in
as deo agents.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.686
We won't.

09:19.626 --> 09:20.792
Okay...

09:20.794 --> 09:22.294
That is cool.

09:22.296 --> 09:23.728
Kara: I have to get
back to work.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.697
-And, by "work,"
do you mean James?
-No.

09:25.699 --> 09:29.367
(Chuckles) Especially not now.
His ex showed up.

09:29.369 --> 09:30.502
Lucy Lane.

09:30.504 --> 09:32.971
-As in Lois Lane?
-Her sister.

09:34.174 --> 09:37.175
She's gorgeous, she's smart...
Smells nice.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.044
Hell, I want to date her.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.745
Well, was she
out saving the world?

09:40.747 --> 09:43.548
She's a lawyer for the
military, so, yes.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.550
Oh. Well, can she fly?

09:45.552 --> 09:48.253
(Sighs) I wouldn't be
surprised.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.155
But if James broke up with her

09:50.157 --> 09:51.723
and then moved all the way
out to national city,

09:51.725 --> 09:53.425
then why would he want to get
back together with her?

09:53.427 --> 09:55.493
-He told me
she broke up with him.
-No.

09:55.495 --> 09:57.729
No, no, do not
talk to James about her.

09:57.731 --> 10:00.832
That is a first-class one-way
ticket to the friend zone.

10:00.834 --> 10:03.001
I am not in the friend zone.

10:03.003 --> 10:06.638
You've spent more time
in the friend zone
than the phantom zone.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.073
Okay? You're that girl.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.741
You always want to help,
so you...

10:09.743 --> 10:11.476
Listen to their
girlfriend troubles, and...

10:11.478 --> 10:14.312
Instead of being
the girlfriend. Right.

10:14.314 --> 10:18.483
Kara, you've had
to pretend to be someone else
for most of your life.

10:18.485 --> 10:20.318
But you don't have to hide
with James.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.822
He knows your secret
and he likes you.

10:23.824 --> 10:27.826
Besides, what kind of idiot
would choose
Lucy Lane over Supergirl?

10:27.828 --> 10:29.160
-(Phone beeps)
-Hello?

10:29.162 --> 10:30.662
Oh! Hi, Ms. Grant.

10:30.664 --> 10:33.898
How's Carter?
Does he miss his mom?

10:33.900 --> 10:35.467
(Whispers) Oh my god! Carter!

10:35.469 --> 10:37.702
I was supposed to pick him up!

10:37.704 --> 10:40.739
You need to park
in the green zone and walk
to the line-up,

10:40.741 --> 10:44.442
or you need to idle
in the yellow zone and put
the placard in the...

10:44.444 --> 10:47.278
-(Wind whistling on phone)
-What's that noise?

10:47.280 --> 10:49.214
I've got the windows open!

10:49.216 --> 10:52.017
Wait, are you trying
to tell me that you're
not there yet?

10:52.019 --> 10:53.652
Pulling up right now.

10:53.654 --> 10:56.354
I did not hear the sound
of children at play.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.523
Kara: <i> It's just...</i>
<i> Super windy!</i>

10:58.525 --> 10:59.758
Gotta go!

11:05.065 --> 11:07.532
(Sighs)

11:07.534 --> 11:10.735
Hey! Ms. Grant put
my name on the list.

11:10.737 --> 11:11.903
Its Kara danvers.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.505
Yeah, I just need a signature.

11:13.507 --> 11:15.407
Yes.

11:15.409 --> 11:17.676
Thanks, he's all yours.
Have fun, Carter.

11:19.212 --> 11:21.579
Hey, I'm Kara.

11:21.581 --> 11:23.748
You remember me
from your mom's office?

11:26.353 --> 11:28.486
You've grown
since I last saw you.

11:31.625 --> 11:32.691
So, how was school?

11:34.795 --> 11:36.461
This is a really good school.

11:36.463 --> 11:38.496
I'm surprised they
haven't taught you guys
to speak out loud yet.

11:38.498 --> 11:41.366
-(Chuckles softly)
-Kara: I actually really
liked school.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.401
Learning all about
this new planet...

11:45.205 --> 11:48.173
(Stammering)
That I am also from.

11:48.175 --> 11:50.842
Not that I was a nerd
or anything.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.177
(Laughs nervously)

11:52.179 --> 11:54.546
My mom says it's okay
to be a nerd.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.247
She says if you can
face your fears

11:56.249 --> 11:58.483
and come out of your shell,
then...

11:58.485 --> 12:00.719
Nerds can win in the end.

12:05.525 --> 12:07.192
God, I hope so.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.328
Yes, this is my technology.

12:10.330 --> 12:11.730
Mind telling me
where you found it?

12:11.732 --> 12:14.032
Inside a bomb that destroyed
a lab yesterday.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.333
(Chuckles)

12:15.335 --> 12:17.268
Alex: You don't seem
concerned by that.

12:17.270 --> 12:20.004
I'm very concerned
with how my technology
ended up in a weapon,

12:20.006 --> 12:21.272
since I don't make them,

12:21.274 --> 12:23.108
but not with becoming
your suspect.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.476
Alex: And why is that?

12:24.478 --> 12:25.810
Because it was my lab
that was destroyed.

12:25.812 --> 12:27.479
It was a subsidiary
of one of my companies.

12:27.481 --> 12:29.280
Not that it's
public knowledge.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.216
Hank: And you didn't think
to share that information
with us?

12:31.218 --> 12:33.852
I prefer not to rely on
the government to solve
my problems.

12:33.854 --> 12:35.520
Any idea who's targeting you?

12:35.522 --> 12:38.356
(Chuckles) I'm trying
to change the world,
agent danvers.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.358
So anyone invested
in maintaining the status quo

12:40.360 --> 12:41.893
would be interested
in targeting me.

12:41.895 --> 12:44.262
That's a conveniently large
suspect pool.

12:44.264 --> 12:47.265
All right, well, let's narrow
it down to former employees
with access to the lab,

12:47.267 --> 12:48.700
who know how
to modify the tech,

12:48.702 --> 12:51.102
and have a personal grudge
against you.

12:51.104 --> 12:54.072
I guess now we know who's
the brains of the outfit.

12:54.074 --> 12:57.275
Well, you'll be glad to hear
I'm leaving her behind
to protect you.

12:59.579 --> 13:02.614
Woman: (On TV)
<i> Tonight, Maxwell lord</i>
<i> launches his super train</i>

13:02.616 --> 13:05.650
<i> on its maiden voyage,</i>
<i> with this...</i>

13:05.652 --> 13:08.520
You know,
I didn't get my first cell
phone until I was 16.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.655
True story.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.993
Are you sure there's
nothing I can get you?

13:14.995 --> 13:17.495
A snack? A juice box?

13:17.497 --> 13:19.964
Anything that
will make you happy...

13:19.966 --> 13:21.666
Supergirl!

13:21.668 --> 13:22.934
Kara: Oh.

13:22.936 --> 13:24.669
Woman: (On TV)
<i> ...No one can beat Supergirl.</i>

13:25.739 --> 13:27.138
Oh, you like Supergirl?

13:27.140 --> 13:28.606
She's so cool.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.408
Last week,
she stopped reactron.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.277
Superman never did that.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.779
And earlier she caught
an entire building.

13:34.781 --> 13:36.648
And she can shoot lasers
out of her eyes.

13:36.650 --> 13:39.117
Wow, she does sound
pretty cool.

13:39.119 --> 13:41.019
I didn't say she was pretty.

13:41.021 --> 13:43.454
I didn't say
you said she was pretty.

13:45.091 --> 13:47.725
Why?
Do you think she's pretty?

13:47.727 --> 13:48.893
Well, I guess.

13:48.895 --> 13:50.595
I don't know.

13:50.597 --> 13:53.531
Carter, do you
maybe have a little crush
on Supergirl?

13:53.533 --> 13:55.333
You got good taste, kid.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.634
This is my friend winn.

13:56.636 --> 13:59.838
You're Supergirl fan, huh?

13:59.840 --> 14:02.607
You know...
(Whispers) I know her.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.809
-No, you don't.
-No, you don't.

14:06.813 --> 14:09.214
(Stammers) I mean, like...
I feel like I know her.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.349
-Kara: Mmm-hmm.
-Because she's always
there for people.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.284
You know, she's helping out.

14:13.286 --> 14:15.753
-Saving those who need saving.
-Yeah.

14:15.755 --> 14:17.121
(Chuckles)

14:17.123 --> 14:21.759
Uh, especially those who, um,
have run out of staples.

14:21.761 --> 14:23.428
(Banging)

14:23.430 --> 14:25.163
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa...
Got it.

14:25.165 --> 14:26.831
Uh, the stapler is
not our enemy.

14:26.833 --> 14:29.067
Layout can't
find the copy I sent down
two hours ago.

14:29.069 --> 14:32.670
Because I... I forgot
to send it, I'm so sorry.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.839
And... I just broke
the stapler.

14:34.841 --> 14:37.909
Plus, digital's now
inundated because of the
bombing story, I...

14:39.079 --> 14:40.712
How does cat do it?

14:40.714 --> 14:42.280
She's Ms. Grant.

14:42.749 --> 14:44.215
And she has you.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.750
Well, so do you.

14:48.955 --> 14:50.321
(Laughs nervously)

14:52.859 --> 14:54.659
(Cell phone vibrates)

14:54.661 --> 14:57.629
-Uh, it's Lucy.
-Ignore it.

14:57.631 --> 14:59.364
-You sure?
-Yeah.

14:59.366 --> 15:01.399
I mean, there was a time
I would've done anything
for that woman,

15:01.401 --> 15:02.734
but she dumped me.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.602
She just can't stand
that I got over it.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.471
So, now she's following
me across the country, like...

15:06.473 --> 15:09.040
James, I know that
you feel like you're juggling
a lot right now,

15:09.042 --> 15:11.776
which, believe me,
I completely understand
how that feels,

15:11.778 --> 15:14.312
but maybe, right now,
we should just focus on work.

15:15.682 --> 15:16.748
Yeah.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.251
(Sighs)

15:20.253 --> 15:23.554
So, I will coordinate
with digital and make sure
finance is in the loop.

15:23.556 --> 15:26.157
You're right, sorry.

15:26.159 --> 15:29.360
Take that, friend zone.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.763
Maxwell: You like trains,
agent danvers?

15:31.765 --> 15:34.098
No, physics.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.734
You're using
electromagnetic propulsion.

15:36.736 --> 15:40.338
The lack of friction
allows us to reach speeds of
500 kilometers an hour.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.807
So how do you keep
the mag-coils
from overheating?

15:42.809 --> 15:45.243
-Is it... liquid helium?
-Yeah.

15:45.245 --> 15:47.712
No hazardous byproduct.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.647
Tell me, agent danvers,
why are you wasting that brain

15:49.649 --> 15:50.982
kicking down doors
for the government?

15:50.984 --> 15:52.884
Why do you mistrust
the government so much?

15:54.587 --> 15:57.288
Answering with a question,
keep the subject talking.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.657
Basic field agent procedure.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.826
And here I thought we had
something special.

16:02.929 --> 16:05.029
Okay, fine.

16:05.031 --> 16:07.065
I work for the government,
because I believe

16:07.067 --> 16:09.434
there's no higher calling
than helping others.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.871
I feel the same way.

16:15.041 --> 16:17.508
Only I do it without a gun.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.243
The world needs
a new kind of hero.

16:19.245 --> 16:20.712
I thought we just got one.

16:20.714 --> 16:23.114
(Chuckles) Supergirl's just
a glorified fireman.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.983
She's not going to solve the
underlying problems

16:24.985 --> 16:26.584
that are actually destroying
this planet.

16:26.586 --> 16:27.885
You really don't trust anyone,
do you?

16:27.887 --> 16:29.487
I've never met anyone
worth trusting.

16:29.489 --> 16:30.955
Well, that is a very lonely
way to live.

16:32.525 --> 16:33.958
You have no idea.

16:35.562 --> 16:37.261
(Intercom buzzes)

16:37.263 --> 16:38.529
Paulina: <i> Mr. lord?</i>

16:39.332 --> 16:40.698
Yes, Paulina?

16:40.700 --> 16:42.533
Paulina: <i> Could you come</i>
<i> down to level three?</i>

16:42.535 --> 16:45.236
Security discovered it
during a routine sweep
of the floor.

16:45.238 --> 16:46.938
(Device beeping)

16:48.575 --> 16:49.874
Clear the building.

16:50.877 --> 16:53.077
Don't move that,
it could go off!

16:53.079 --> 16:55.446
That never happened
with the fulcrum weight
of a helium core.

16:55.448 --> 16:56.848
We need to evacuate.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.649
I've got a lab full
of people at work, here.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.485
I'd like to keep it
from going up in smoke.

17:01.254 --> 17:02.987
Then, move over.

17:02.989 --> 17:04.856
I'm not going to let
your bravado blow
the both of us up.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.824
(Beeping)

17:06.826 --> 17:08.860
This lunatic is trying to kill
me with my own technology.

17:08.862 --> 17:12.096
While I appreciate the irony,
I don't plan on giving him
the satisfaction.

17:12.098 --> 17:14.632
Trust me,
I know which wire to cut.

17:15.235 --> 17:16.667
It's not a problem.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.637
-(Wire snaps)
-(Beeping stops)

17:19.639 --> 17:22.473
-(Chuckles)
-(Beeping resumes faster)

17:25.111 --> 17:26.844
We may have a problem.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.518
Kara, do you have the live...

17:33.520 --> 17:37.889
Oh, uh, live,
plus seven-day ratings for the
midwest satellite stations.

17:37.891 --> 17:39.390
-There.
-Thank you.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.959
-Um, how you doing?
-Handling.

17:41.961 --> 17:44.262
Digital called,
sounds like you are, too.

17:47.767 --> 17:50.101
-That guy knows
superman, right?
-Yes, he does.

17:50.103 --> 17:53.671
Do you think he could get
superman to introduce me
to Supergirl?

17:53.673 --> 17:56.407
You are definitely
your mother's son.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.810
(Cell phone ringing)

17:58.812 --> 18:00.445
Yeah, what's up?

18:00.447 --> 18:02.146
I am at lord tech with
a bomb that is gonna go off
in a minute.

18:02.148 --> 18:03.681
On my way.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.183
Carter, um...

18:05.185 --> 18:07.452
I have an emergency
errand to run.

18:09.289 --> 18:10.922
I need you to watch
Ms. Grant's son.

18:10.924 --> 18:14.058
Whoa! Like, really?
'Cause I am not good
with kids.

18:14.060 --> 18:16.894
You eat cereal for dinner,
and your desk is covered
with toys.

18:16.896 --> 18:18.296
They are not toys.

18:18.298 --> 18:20.498
They are adult collectibles.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.501
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, I got it.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.040
Alex:
We need to get out of here!

18:29.042 --> 18:30.942
I can delay the detonation
by freezing the circuitry.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.276
There's no time!

18:33.713 --> 18:35.580
Supergirl.
Thank god you're here.

18:35.582 --> 18:36.981
Supergirl: Not a problem.
Plenty of time.

18:36.983 --> 18:39.217
This bomb is like
a high-tech Daisy cutter.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.352
If it blows, it'll produce an
overpressure of 2,000 pounds
per square inch.

18:41.354 --> 18:42.620
That'll level
30 square blocks.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.322
You need to get it clear
of the city.

18:51.831 --> 18:54.732
She's nearing the ocean.
Approaching mach two.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.901
She's not far enough
from the city.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.169
Supergirl, change bearing.

18:58.171 --> 18:59.637
-Which way?
-Hank: <i> Up!</i>

19:02.275 --> 19:03.941
-Throw the bomb!
-Not yet!

19:03.943 --> 19:05.009
I have to get higher!

19:06.212 --> 19:08.746
You're out of time.
Throw it! Now!

19:12.118 --> 19:13.551
(Grunting)

19:21.094 --> 19:22.760
(Supergirl breathing heavily)

19:23.930 --> 19:24.996
(Groaning)

19:34.374 --> 19:35.740
(Groaning)

19:38.244 --> 19:40.378
(Gasps)

19:41.381 --> 19:43.548
That was some fall you took.

19:44.951 --> 19:46.784
Easy. You're at the deo.

19:46.786 --> 19:49.086
Rescue team pulled you
out of the ocean.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.491
Concentrated solar waves
mimic earth's yellow sun,

19:53.493 --> 19:55.259
and recharge your
Kryptonian cells.

19:55.261 --> 19:56.394
(Groans)

19:56.396 --> 19:57.595
Alex: Kara?

19:57.597 --> 19:59.530
Oh, I was so scared.

20:00.867 --> 20:02.600
Are you okay?

20:03.203 --> 20:04.969
Thanks to the boss.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.938
If I let you drown,
I'd never hear the end of it
from her.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.747
We got a shot of the bomber
from the security cameras
at Max's lab.

20:16.749 --> 20:19.417
Facial recognition came up
with a match.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.751
His name is Ethan Knox.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.386
Worked at the first lab
that was attacked.

20:22.388 --> 20:25.423
He was fired six months ago
when his work became erratic.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.291
His family reported him
missing two weeks ago.

20:27.293 --> 20:28.993
So, how do we find him?

20:28.995 --> 20:30.628
"We?" No.

20:30.630 --> 20:33.664
A fall from that height
would've rattled your cousin.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.099
You are staying home.

20:35.101 --> 20:37.702
There is a literal mad bomber
out there!

20:37.704 --> 20:39.337
And I have get back to work.

20:39.339 --> 20:41.172
Oh, my god, Ms. Grant's son...

20:41.174 --> 20:42.406
I've to get back
to the office.

20:42.408 --> 20:43.908
I'm supposed to be
babysitting him!

20:43.910 --> 20:45.943
Kara, maybe you're spreading
yourself too thin.

20:45.945 --> 20:49.714
You're trying to be Supergirl
and cat's assistant

20:49.716 --> 20:52.116
and a deo agent
on top of it all.

20:52.118 --> 20:55.786
At some point,
even the girl of steel
might break.

20:59.192 --> 21:01.659
I never knew my mom's office
could be this awesome!

21:01.661 --> 21:04.161
Oh, man, I do this all the...
Never!

21:04.163 --> 21:07.465
No, I've...
I've never done this before.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.500
-Kara!
-Carter, are you all right?

21:09.502 --> 21:11.335
I'm so sorry I was gone.

21:11.337 --> 21:12.737
Winn: We're good.
Carter: Hi.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.839
Kara: Are you hungry
for some real food?

21:15.775 --> 21:18.376
I'm gonna get some lunch.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.478
Thank you for watching him.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.013
I don't know what I would do
without you.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.416
Winn, you're getting killed!

21:27.020 --> 21:28.552
Every day, kid.

21:30.323 --> 21:32.223
Kara, right?

21:32.225 --> 21:34.191
-Yes, hey!
-Lucy Lane.

21:34.193 --> 21:36.894
Yes, you are.

21:36.896 --> 21:38.996
You must really like
the food here.

21:38.998 --> 21:42.099
Well, I left my phone
here yesterday.
I've been a little frazzled.

21:42.101 --> 21:43.734
You?

21:43.736 --> 21:47.605
Uh, you do not seem
like the kind of person
who gets frazzled.

21:47.607 --> 21:49.407
Just because I look
a certain way on the outside,

21:49.409 --> 21:53.110
everyone assumes it matches
the way I feel on the inside.

21:53.112 --> 21:55.112
Yeah, I get that.

21:55.114 --> 21:56.647
I wish Jimmy would.

21:57.116 --> 21:58.182
Right.

21:58.184 --> 22:00.151
Right, um...

22:00.153 --> 22:04.555
Well, my milkshake's
are getting milkier, I should
probably get going.

22:06.859 --> 22:09.727
Hey, Kara,
can I ask you a question?

22:09.729 --> 22:14.298
It's awkward and I kind of
don't want to hear the answer,
but...

22:14.300 --> 22:16.067
Is Jimmy seeing anyone?

22:16.069 --> 22:17.134
What?

22:17.937 --> 22:19.036
No.

22:19.038 --> 22:20.671
No, he just moved here.

22:22.141 --> 22:24.175
What about Supergirl?

22:25.311 --> 22:27.778
-Supergirl?
-I saw the news.

22:27.780 --> 22:31.182
Jimmy by her side.
Fighting reactron.

22:31.184 --> 22:35.086
I'm just worried he's gonna
find her... irresistible.

22:36.422 --> 22:39.990
(Chuckling) No.

22:39.992 --> 22:41.826
Really?

22:41.828 --> 22:44.662
Jimmy thinks my work
came between us,
but he's wrong.

22:44.664 --> 22:47.131
Maybe I should've
appreciated him more,

22:47.133 --> 22:50.434
but the reason I
prioritize work, is because
he prioritized...

22:50.436 --> 22:51.736
Him.

22:52.305 --> 22:53.604
Superman.

22:53.606 --> 22:55.139
No matter where we were
or what we were doing,

22:55.141 --> 22:57.775
Jimmy took off the moment
superman called.

22:57.777 --> 23:02.713
And I couldn't complain,
because of course they were
off saving people's lives.

23:02.715 --> 23:06.550
He says I left him, but...
He left us first.

23:06.552 --> 23:08.452
(Stammers) Lucy, I'm so sorry.

23:08.454 --> 23:10.521
And this hero wears a skirt.

23:10.523 --> 23:12.923
How am I ever gonna
compete with her?

23:20.466 --> 23:23.000
You fired Ethan Knox
six months ago.

23:23.002 --> 23:26.404
His wife divorced him,
got sole custody
of their child.

23:26.406 --> 23:29.673
When his daughter got sick,
he snapped and he needed
someone to blame.

23:29.675 --> 23:32.476
So, looks like, he chose you.

23:32.478 --> 23:34.612
Knox will target
that event tonight.

23:34.614 --> 23:36.046
You have to cancel it.

23:36.048 --> 23:38.082
I won't be intimidated
by a terrorist.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.850
Why are you fighting me?

23:39.852 --> 23:41.452
I'm trying to protect
your train.

23:41.454 --> 23:44.155
I don't put much faith
in the government's idea
of protection.

23:44.157 --> 23:45.890
I read your file.

23:45.892 --> 23:49.760
Your parents were doctors
who developed vaccines
against bio-weapons.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.896
They worked
for the government.

23:51.898 --> 23:53.831
They didn't see it
as the enemy.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.300
No, they didn't.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.704
So when they raised concerns
about the safety of their lab,

24:00.706 --> 24:03.841
they trusted
the government's findings.

24:03.843 --> 24:06.043
"Acceptable risk levels."

24:07.246 --> 24:09.647
Two months later,
an air system malfunctioned.

24:09.649 --> 24:12.349
A virus entered
their pressure suits...

24:13.519 --> 24:16.954
Their internal organs melted.

24:16.956 --> 24:19.657
When it was all over,
there was nothing
left to bury.

24:20.693 --> 24:21.959
I'm sorry.

24:22.395 --> 24:23.894
(Scoffs)

24:23.896 --> 24:26.831
That's the first apology
the government's
ever given me.

24:26.833 --> 24:29.934
-Alex: They covered it up.
-You can't be surprised.

24:31.971 --> 24:34.705
What happened to you
was a tragedy.

24:35.908 --> 24:37.942
I'm trying to prevent
another one.

24:38.945 --> 24:42.346
Rejecting our help
is not rational.

24:42.348 --> 24:45.182
You are a man of logic, Max.

24:45.184 --> 24:46.650
I'm also an orphan.

24:46.652 --> 24:48.219
We don't get over
things easily.

24:48.221 --> 24:52.189
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a train to catch.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.328
-(Clears throat) Hey.
-Hey, Kara.

24:57.330 --> 24:59.330
Uh, I have one live camera
at the train station

24:59.332 --> 25:01.565
and I just want to confirm
that all of our reporters

25:01.567 --> 25:03.234
have the correct
press credentials.

25:03.236 --> 25:05.836
Right, I meant to double-check
that and I will right after...

25:05.838 --> 25:07.271
I give Carter his lunch.

25:07.273 --> 25:08.973
No, no, it's cool.
Your hands are full.

25:08.975 --> 25:11.242
I'll take care of it.

25:11.244 --> 25:15.346
Listen, I'm really
sorry that I cut you off
about Lucy, earlier.

25:15.348 --> 25:17.548
No. No, you were right.

25:17.550 --> 25:21.852
And, you know, you're just
so easy to talk to sometimes,
it's hard not to.

25:23.689 --> 25:26.657
Apparently, Lucy feels
the same way.

25:28.094 --> 25:30.327
We ran into each other
at noonan's.

25:32.098 --> 25:34.098
And she talked to you
about me?

25:36.569 --> 25:37.768
She still loves you.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.169
No, she doesn't, she ended it.

25:39.171 --> 25:41.705
Because she felt you chose
superman over her.

25:41.707 --> 25:43.207
She was tired of coming
in second.

25:45.478 --> 25:48.746
Look, I don't know anything
about romantic love.

25:48.748 --> 25:51.749
I have not had
the best luck with it.

25:51.751 --> 25:55.419
But if I ever really had it,

25:56.389 --> 25:57.821
I think I'd fight for it.

25:59.158 --> 26:01.158
I already put that behind me,
Kara.

26:02.628 --> 26:05.296
I don't want to go back there.

26:05.298 --> 26:08.065
(Voice breaking)
I don't want to do that again.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.067
Who does?

26:10.069 --> 26:12.870
But, I mean, are you really
ready to move on?

26:12.872 --> 26:16.173
Because if you're not,
that might not be fair.

26:17.843 --> 26:19.343
Fair to whom?

26:21.314 --> 26:22.580
To...

26:22.582 --> 26:24.882
Whomever comes next.

26:28.854 --> 26:30.821
This is getting cold.
Carter's lunch.

26:30.823 --> 26:33.924
Uh, I will check on
those credentials for
the train launch.

26:39.465 --> 26:41.398
Agents are positioned
around the perimeter.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.701
I have commandeered
the security cameras
at the station,

26:43.703 --> 26:45.336
but there's no sign of Knox.

26:45.338 --> 26:47.671
Sounds like you could
use some help.

26:47.673 --> 26:48.939
Are you sure
you're up for this?

26:48.941 --> 26:51.008
Somebody's gotta
protect that train.

26:51.010 --> 26:54.745
And once it gets moving,
even the deo won't be able
to keep up with it.

26:54.747 --> 26:56.013
Be careful.

27:03.823 --> 27:05.456
I'm flying back to Metropolis.

27:06.525 --> 27:07.791
-You finish your case?
-No.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.893
I told you, that was
just an excuse.

27:09.895 --> 27:13.697
Okay, so, you break my heart,
and now you're using superman
as an excuse?

27:13.699 --> 27:15.299
Just like you use my career.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.668
Be honest, your heart
was never really in it.

27:17.670 --> 27:20.537
We have completely different
views of what happened,

27:20.539 --> 27:21.672
and that's not surprising.

27:21.674 --> 27:22.906
But I came here.

27:22.908 --> 27:24.942
-I tried.
-I don't know, Lucy.

27:24.944 --> 27:27.978
You know, maybe
it's better for us just to
find other people.

27:32.118 --> 27:33.817
This new life looks
good on you.

27:33.819 --> 27:36.320
You have new friends.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.789
Kara, who I really like.

27:41.260 --> 27:43.794
You know,
I want what's best for you.

27:49.769 --> 27:51.435
And I want
what's best for you.

27:57.410 --> 27:58.876
(James sighs)

28:05.351 --> 28:08.085
(Sighs)
There's no sign of Knox.
What about you?

28:08.087 --> 28:10.154
I don't see him either.

28:10.156 --> 28:12.890
Man: (On TV) <i> Maxwell lord's</i>
<i> new super train is in...</i>

28:12.892 --> 28:14.825
Winn: Hey, you all right?

28:15.895 --> 28:17.361
(Clears throat)

28:17.363 --> 28:19.496
Uh, girl trouble.

28:19.498 --> 28:22.466
Girl trouble? You?

28:22.468 --> 28:25.803
-Whoa, where's Carter?
-(Cell phone rings)

28:25.805 --> 28:27.604
James Olsen.

28:27.606 --> 28:31.175
Yeah, no, I...
I authorized the increase
in the art budget...

28:31.177 --> 28:34.712
Man: (On TV) <i> Do you expect</i>
<i> Supergirl to attend tonight</i>
<i> in light of the bombings?</i>

28:34.714 --> 28:37.948
Maxwell: (Laughs)
<i> We're here to talk about the</i>
<i> future of this planet,</i>

28:37.950 --> 28:39.450
<i> not guest lists.</i>

28:39.452 --> 28:40.884
No, no, no...

28:40.886 --> 28:43.087
Please tell me he did not go
down there to meet Supergirl!

28:53.466 --> 28:56.467
<i> The super rail is now ready</i>
<i> for passengers.</i>

29:03.175 --> 29:06.310
Scanning the train.
I don't see the bomb.

29:06.312 --> 29:08.011
Agent henshaw,
report just came in.

29:08.013 --> 29:09.480
Bomb found at the airport.

29:09.482 --> 29:11.181
But the train has been
Max's obsession.

29:11.183 --> 29:12.683
That's what Knox would hit.

29:12.685 --> 29:15.085
Or it's a decoy to draw us
away from the real bomb.

29:15.087 --> 29:16.954
Supergirl, there's a bomb
at the lord air terminal.

29:16.956 --> 29:18.355
I'm on it!

29:20.626 --> 29:23.727
We need to send every
available Metro reporter
to the airport.

29:23.729 --> 29:26.497
-Why?
-Ncpd found a bomb.

29:31.337 --> 29:35.706
Come on, Lucy.
Pick up, pick up, pick up!
Lucy, come on...

29:35.708 --> 29:39.176
Lucy: <i> You've reached</i>
<i> the cellphone of Lucy Lane.</i>
<i> Please leave a message.</i>

29:42.782 --> 29:44.715
Hey, there.
You got a ticket?

29:44.717 --> 29:45.849
Uh...

29:45.851 --> 29:48.552
Maxwell: Lost your parents?

29:48.554 --> 29:51.288
-(Laughs) Sure.
-They already on board?

29:51.290 --> 29:52.589
Uh-huh.

29:52.591 --> 29:54.925
Then let's make sure you
find them. Come on.
It's okay.

30:01.033 --> 30:02.299
I have to get on that train!

30:02.301 --> 30:03.801
Then let me see your ticket.

30:03.803 --> 30:06.170
You don't understand.
I need to get on that train.

30:08.974 --> 30:11.375
Welcome to the future, kid.

30:43.275 --> 30:44.641
Kara, where are you?

30:44.643 --> 30:46.677
Can't talk, there's a bomb
at the airport.

30:46.679 --> 30:48.712
No, no, that's wrong,
I just saw the bomber
on the train.

30:48.714 --> 30:50.581
That means
there are two bombs?

30:50.583 --> 30:53.417
Worse than that...
Carter is on the train.

30:54.753 --> 30:56.787
-Alex, did you hear all that?
-We did.

30:56.789 --> 30:58.055
What do you want to do?

30:58.057 --> 30:59.623
I can't be in two places
at once!

30:59.625 --> 31:01.458
We have visual confirmation
at the airport.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.894
We can't even be sure what
your friend saw was accurate.

31:03.896 --> 31:07.030
I trust my friend,
just like I trust you.

31:07.032 --> 31:10.634
New plan.
You take the airport,
I've got the train.

31:10.636 --> 31:12.169
(Engine revving)

31:16.375 --> 31:18.442
(Supergirl whooshing)

31:25.517 --> 31:27.384
You see your parents anywhere?

31:31.390 --> 31:34.057
I'm starting to think
you have a thing for me.

31:34.059 --> 31:35.993
-Ethan Knox is on board.
-No.

31:35.995 --> 31:38.495
-That's impossible...
-You have to stop this train.

31:38.497 --> 31:39.997
I can't.

31:39.999 --> 31:41.565
It's automated.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.233
Something's wrong, isn't it?

31:44.637 --> 31:48.338
There is a problem,
but I'm here to fix it.

31:48.340 --> 31:51.842
You look brave and strong,
can you help me?

31:53.178 --> 31:55.379
Good.

31:55.381 --> 31:58.448
I need you and Mr. lord
to get all of these passengers
to the very back of the train.

31:59.485 --> 32:01.318
Are you ready to be a hero?

32:01.987 --> 32:03.420
(Sighs) Yes.

32:04.290 --> 32:05.789
Let's go.

32:05.791 --> 32:07.424
(Crowd clamoring)

32:21.006 --> 32:22.639
(Sirens wailing)

32:23.876 --> 32:25.442
(Brakes screeching)

32:29.682 --> 32:31.481
Hank: Get the team inside
to help with evac.

32:31.483 --> 32:32.983
Alex: All right,
I'll meet you at the bomb.

32:32.985 --> 32:35.319
James: Where's Supergirl?
Hank: She's not coming.

32:39.959 --> 32:41.325
Lucy!

32:41.327 --> 32:42.993
-James?
-You okay?

32:42.995 --> 32:44.227
I heard what happened.

32:44.229 --> 32:45.929
Why would you run
towards a bomb?

32:47.199 --> 32:48.532
Because you're here.

32:54.606 --> 32:56.606
Clear the room!
Let's go, come on!

32:56.608 --> 32:58.342
Alex: Bomb tech's
not here yet.

32:59.511 --> 33:01.011
Signal is jammed.

33:01.013 --> 33:03.680
I can't see inside it.
There's no way to disarm it.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.984
-Get yourself clear.
-Me?

33:06.986 --> 33:09.353
What are you going to do?

33:09.355 --> 33:11.888
-Hank, no.
-I gave you an order.

33:13.359 --> 33:14.825
I said...

33:14.827 --> 33:15.892
Go!

33:26.271 --> 33:28.438
(Train rumbling)

33:30.509 --> 33:31.875
(Door beeping)

33:39.551 --> 33:41.318
This bomb is rigged
with altimeter.

33:41.320 --> 33:44.021
You try to move me
off the train,
it goes off instantly.

33:44.023 --> 33:45.355
Ethan, I want to help you.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.157
But you've got to
deactivate that first.

33:47.159 --> 33:50.794
-There's no way out for me.
-There's always hope.

33:50.796 --> 33:54.331
I know you're upset,
but think about your daughter.

33:57.002 --> 33:59.002
(Device beeping)

34:18.457 --> 34:20.557
(Beeping rapidly)

34:22.828 --> 34:25.829
-Man: He's not gonna
make it, is he?
-Just take cover.

34:34.173 --> 34:36.406
(Crowd applauding)

34:38.710 --> 34:40.277
-Alex: How...
-It was a dud.

34:40.279 --> 34:43.113
It was just a decoy to draw us
away from the real bomb.

34:47.219 --> 34:49.553
Ethan, don't do this.

34:49.555 --> 34:51.054
You don't understand.
You can't.

34:51.056 --> 34:53.723
I understand what it feels
like to be overwhelmed.

34:53.725 --> 34:56.126
But you are not alone.
I can help you.

34:56.128 --> 34:58.628
-Stay back!
-I know your daughter's sick.

34:58.630 --> 35:01.865
She needs you.
Don't you want to help her?

35:01.867 --> 35:04.234
That's what this is all about.

35:04.236 --> 35:05.702
It's her only hope.

35:05.704 --> 35:08.438
-What do you mean?
-It doesn't matter anymore...

35:08.440 --> 35:12.142
No one was supposed
to know it was me, and now
that they do, I'll...

35:12.144 --> 35:15.011
I can never face my
little girl again.

35:15.013 --> 35:16.513
Ethan...

35:16.515 --> 35:20.517
Please, do not kill all
of those people.

35:28.093 --> 35:29.159
I won't.

35:30.696 --> 35:32.129
You'll save them.

35:36.001 --> 35:39.469
But you better hurry,
you have 30 seconds.

35:52.718 --> 35:54.184
(Latch unlocking)

36:04.997 --> 36:06.530
(Grunting)

36:12.671 --> 36:14.938
(Supergirl yelling)

36:15.941 --> 36:18.008
(Gasping)

36:28.020 --> 36:29.186
(Exploding)

36:43.936 --> 36:46.970
Hey, would you hand me
that Allen wrench?

36:48.540 --> 36:50.674
That works, too.

36:50.676 --> 36:53.476
Okay, that is weird.

36:53.478 --> 36:55.078
Hank said that this was a dud.

36:55.080 --> 36:58.014
(Stammers) A decoy to draw us
away from the real bomb,

36:58.016 --> 37:01.818
but that is a kill switch used
to disable it remotely.

37:01.820 --> 37:05.288
Why would you put a fail safe
on a fake bomb?

37:05.290 --> 37:07.891
Yeah, that's not the only
thing that doesn't add up.

37:07.893 --> 37:11.928
Knox killing himself
makes no sense.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.730
Well, crazy guy snaps,
gets even crazier?

37:13.732 --> 37:17.133
Well, he didn't seem crazy,
he seemed sad.

37:17.135 --> 37:19.302
He said he loved his daughter,
he was doing it for her,

37:19.304 --> 37:22.606
but how do these bombings
help a sick girl?

37:22.608 --> 37:26.610
Who knows? Parents can go nuts
when it comes to their kids.

37:28.647 --> 37:30.547
How do you think
a parent would feel

37:30.549 --> 37:34.618
if their kid ended up
on that train, by himself,
with a bomb on it?

37:34.620 --> 37:36.353
Oh, Kara, I'm so sorry.

37:36.355 --> 37:38.221
I'm so fired!

37:38.223 --> 37:39.589
Mom!

37:40.826 --> 37:43.493
Honey! Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh! I was so worried.

37:43.495 --> 37:44.861
Are you okay?

37:44.863 --> 37:46.730
Are you okay? Were you scared?

37:46.732 --> 37:49.032
-Did you get hurt?
-I met Supergirl!

37:49.034 --> 37:52.135
She was amazing.
And she's so much prettier
in person.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.237
Oh.

37:54.239 --> 37:55.639
Well...

37:55.641 --> 37:58.208
Did you notice any of her
other attributes?

38:00.279 --> 38:01.811
Um, she's super strong...

38:01.813 --> 38:06.116
And smart and brave and kind
and she saved you all.

38:06.118 --> 38:09.786
Tell me, what do you think
makes her a hero?

38:11.690 --> 38:14.324
I'd say her legs.
Definitely her legs.

38:16.395 --> 38:18.762
Her heart, mom.
(Laughs)

38:18.764 --> 38:20.630
(Chuckles) Oh!
That was a joke.
That was a joke.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.966
Carter, you made a joke.
You never make a joke.

38:22.968 --> 38:24.768
(Gasps) School!
School, you have to go
to school.

38:24.770 --> 38:27.437
You're gonna be late.
The car is downstairs
waiting for you.

38:27.439 --> 38:28.972
Did you brush your teeth?

38:28.974 --> 38:30.707
Bye, buddy!
It was fun hanging out
with you.

38:30.709 --> 38:31.875
-Bye, Kara.
-Cat: Oh!

38:31.877 --> 38:34.210
Kara: (Laughs) Oh!

38:34.212 --> 38:37.681
-Mom, Kara and I had
an epic nerf gun battle...
-Yeah, we did.

38:37.683 --> 38:41.451
And she knows how to play
<i> settlers of catan</i> almost as
well as you do.

38:41.453 --> 38:44.521
-Oh...
-Can she watch me again?

38:44.523 --> 38:48.158
I think you should hold on
to those happy memories,
sweetheart.

38:49.294 --> 38:50.794
I love you.

38:50.796 --> 38:51.828
Have a good day at school.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.363
-Go on.
-Bye!

38:53.365 --> 38:54.764
(Elevator dings)

38:59.171 --> 39:02.305
Ms. Grant, I am so,
so sorry.

39:02.307 --> 39:06.376
Suddenly,
I looked up and he was,
he was just gone.

39:06.378 --> 39:08.845
I never should've
let you take him in
the first place.

39:08.847 --> 39:11.114
Kara: It was very hard.
Really, really very hard.

39:11.116 --> 39:13.049
There was work,
and watching Carter,

39:13.051 --> 39:15.318
and then all the
crazy stuff happening
around the city...

39:15.954 --> 39:17.153
I...

39:17.155 --> 39:19.022
I just don't know
how you do it, Ms. Grant.

39:19.024 --> 39:21.191
I don't understand
how you juggle it all.

39:21.193 --> 39:22.726
Oh, Keira.

39:22.728 --> 39:26.129
You have just stumbled
upon the most annoying
question of the century,

39:26.131 --> 39:29.566
and you are so young that
you do not even realize it.

39:29.568 --> 39:32.502
How do you juggle it all?

39:32.504 --> 39:34.871
You learn, that's how.

39:34.873 --> 39:37.841
You start with two balls
before adding another.

39:37.843 --> 39:39.743
I figured out how to be
brilliant in business

39:39.745 --> 39:42.512
and then I added
being a brilliant mother.

39:42.514 --> 39:46.649
Far too many women
burn out trying to do too much
before they're ready.

39:46.651 --> 39:48.852
-So you can have it all?
-Of course.

39:48.854 --> 39:51.254
Just not all at once,
and not right away.

39:52.324 --> 39:54.023
And not with that hair.

39:54.025 --> 39:55.992
Use conditioner,
for god's sake.

40:11.610 --> 40:15.011
Man: (On TV) <i> And we bring you</i>
<i> Maxwell lord's response</i>
<i> to the incident.</i>

40:15.013 --> 40:17.781
Maxwell: <i> Yes, the bomber</i>
<i> did work for my company,</i>
<i> and we did fire him,</i>

40:17.783 --> 40:20.917
<i> but we never anticipated</i>
<i> he would react this way.</i>

40:20.919 --> 40:23.753
<i> I try to build in fail-safes</i>
<i> for every situation.</i>

40:23.755 --> 40:25.388
Fail-safe?

40:25.390 --> 40:27.090
Maxwell: <i> But in the end,</i>
<i> you can't control people.</i>

40:28.460 --> 40:32.595
<i> And I... take full</i>
<i> responsibility for that.</i>

40:32.597 --> 40:36.266
Why is he getting so
choked up about some lunatic
who's trying to kill him?

40:36.268 --> 40:39.002
Because I don't think
we know the whole story.

40:40.005 --> 40:42.338
Can you hack
into hospital records?

40:42.340 --> 40:44.741
Easy-peasy,
fresh and squeezy...

40:46.478 --> 40:49.212
Is not something
a man would say.

40:57.622 --> 41:01.558
(Chuckles) What can I get you?

41:01.560 --> 41:04.861
Or are you not allowed
to drink and fly?
I don't know the rules.

41:04.863 --> 41:07.163
Caught your press conference.

41:07.165 --> 41:09.766
I was surprised,
you're usually a little
more glib.

41:09.768 --> 41:11.601
There was nothing
to be glib about.

41:11.603 --> 41:12.936
A sick little girl lost
her father.

41:12.938 --> 41:15.004
That little girl's being
treated by a doctor

41:15.006 --> 41:18.241
who has a lifetime Grant
from your company.

41:18.243 --> 41:21.010
You said, tonight,
you always build in
fail-safes.

41:21.012 --> 41:23.680
Like the kill switches
in those bombs.

41:23.682 --> 41:27.917
Something tells me
that there was a fail-safe
in Knox's bomb, too.

41:27.919 --> 41:32.055
One that you could've
remotely activated if I didn't
save you in time.

41:32.057 --> 41:36.392
You forced Knox to plant
those bombs in exchange for
saving his daughter's life.

41:36.394 --> 41:38.995
I would never barter
a child's life.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.563
I can't speak
for Knox's motives.

41:40.565 --> 41:42.031
He clearly went insane.

41:42.033 --> 41:43.867
Maybe you didn't expect Knox
to vaporize himself,

41:43.869 --> 41:46.870
but I do know
this was all a ruse.

41:46.872 --> 41:48.838
I just can't figure out
why you did it.

41:49.574 --> 41:50.874
Fascinating theory.

41:51.343 --> 41:52.542
Unprovable,

41:53.478 --> 41:55.378
but worth exploring.

41:55.380 --> 41:59.482
I suspect that whoever is
responsible for these attacks

41:59.484 --> 42:01.484
might be curious about you,
Supergirl.

42:02.687 --> 42:04.087
What is she made of?

42:04.689 --> 42:06.489
How does she do it?

42:09.628 --> 42:11.227
You were testing me.

42:11.229 --> 42:14.397
(Laughs)
And what would these tests
have shown us?

42:14.399 --> 42:17.433
The drone would have measured
your agility.

42:17.435 --> 42:20.169
The building explosion,
your strength.

42:20.171 --> 42:21.838
The next bomb would've
demonstrated your speed

42:21.840 --> 42:24.574
while also revealing
you're not actually
invincible.

42:24.576 --> 42:26.476
(Supergirl sighs)

42:26.478 --> 42:33.049
But the results
of that last test are the
most intriguing of all.

42:33.051 --> 42:35.418
You chose to save a hundred
people on that train,

42:35.420 --> 42:37.854
instead of thousands
at the airport.

42:37.856 --> 42:41.858
One might deduce that there
was someone on that train
that you cared about.

42:41.860 --> 42:47.130
And finding that person is
the key to revealing who you
really are...

42:48.400 --> 42:51.935
When you're not flying around
wearing that "s."

42:51.937 --> 42:55.605
For the record,
I care about everyone.

42:55.607 --> 42:58.808
You may have fooled this city,
but I know you were
behind this.

42:58.810 --> 43:00.343
And I'm watching you.

43:00.812 --> 43:02.211
This isn't over.

43:02.213 --> 43:04.280
Finally, something we
can agree on.

43:09.020 --> 43:11.087
The fun is just beginning.
