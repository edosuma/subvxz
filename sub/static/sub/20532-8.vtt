00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:09.610 --> 00:12.711
¶ I was a girl in the village
doing all right ¶

00:12.713 --> 00:14.980
¶ Then I became
a princess overnight ¶

00:14.982 --> 00:17.716
¶ Now I gotta figure out
how to do it right ¶

00:17.718 --> 00:20.052
¶ So much to learn
and see ¶

00:20.054 --> 00:22.688
¶ Up in the castle
with my new family ¶

00:22.690 --> 00:25.557
¶ In a school that's
just for royalty ¶

00:25.559 --> 00:29.528
¶ A whole enchanted world
is waiting for me ¶

00:29.530 --> 00:33.565
- ¶ I'm so excited to be ¶
- ¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:33.567 --> 00:36.568
¶ I'm finding out what
being royal's all about ¶

00:36.570 --> 00:38.237
¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:38.239 --> 00:40.672
¶ Making my way,
it's an adventure every day ¶

00:40.674 --> 00:43.075
¶ Sofia ¶

00:43.077 --> 00:45.577
- ¶ It's gonna be my time ¶
- ¶ Sofia ¶

00:45.579 --> 00:51.750
¶ To show them all
that I'm Sofia the first ¶

01:02.096 --> 01:04.430
- Here we go.
- Great trick, Minimus.

01:04.432 --> 01:07.099
- Can you do it
going down?
- Let's find out.

01:07.101 --> 01:10.569
Whoo hoo!

01:10.571 --> 01:11.570
Hold on, Sofia.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.240
Sufferin' saddlebags!

01:15.242 --> 01:17.609
- What was that?
- I don't know.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.347
- It's Skye.
- That's Skye?

01:22.349 --> 01:24.116
I missed you.

01:24.118 --> 01:27.052
And I have missed
you, my princess.

01:27.054 --> 01:29.054
Huh. That's a long hug.

01:29.056 --> 01:30.756
Hi. You must
be Skye.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.891
I've heard so much
about you.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.593
( chuckles )

01:34.595 --> 01:37.930
Skye, this is Minimus,
one of my best friends.

01:37.932 --> 01:41.300
My apologies, sir,
for the near-collision.

01:41.302 --> 01:44.369
Oh, that's okay.
Sofia told me that
you're new to flying.

01:44.371 --> 01:46.238
Right, so, anyhoo.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.940
( laughs )

01:47.942 --> 01:49.608
I was, my good man.

01:49.610 --> 01:52.911
Since I last saw her,
I've become quite accomplished.

01:52.913 --> 01:55.647
Ah, here you are,
princess.

01:55.649 --> 01:58.951
- Chrysta, hello.
- Good to see you.

01:58.953 --> 02:01.053
What happened? I saw you
almost hit that flying donkey,

02:01.055 --> 02:02.721
and then you were gone.

02:02.723 --> 02:05.090
Flying donkey?!
Wait a minute.

02:05.092 --> 02:07.759
So is it time for
more Protector training?

02:07.761 --> 02:11.797
Today you get
your WhichWay bow.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.832
- Wow!
- This little beauty

02:13.834 --> 02:16.068
can get you out of
a lot of jams.

02:16.070 --> 02:17.669
Tell it
where you wanna go,

02:17.671 --> 02:21.440
and boom, a magical arrow
guides you there.

02:21.442 --> 02:24.676
Watch. Which way
is the castle?

02:26.981 --> 02:29.014
That's amazing.

02:29.016 --> 02:32.117
It is one of the most important
tools of a Protector.

02:32.119 --> 02:34.253
Go ahead, Sofia.
Give yours a try.

02:34.255 --> 02:37.689
Flick your wrist,
and quickly bring
your hand into position.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.658
Straight up
and snap it.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.865
Wow.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.834
But mine doesn't have
a bowstring.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.969
Of course there's
no bowstring, princess.

02:50.971 --> 02:52.971
You gotta get it
from the Mare of the Mist.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.640
The who of the what?

02:54.642 --> 02:55.841
The Mare of the Mist.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.843
One thing
at a time.

02:57.845 --> 03:00.779
First, we gotta get you
to the Isle of Unicorns.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.181
Ahem!

03:02.183 --> 03:05.284
Oh, right.
I forgot.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.853
See, since you're
non-magical and wingless,

03:07.855 --> 03:09.621
you're gonna need
a flying steed

03:09.623 --> 03:11.723
for Protector assignments
like this.

03:11.725 --> 03:15.494
And I have humbly
volunteered for
the job, my princess.

03:15.496 --> 03:18.530
- Oh, that's
so sweet, Skye.
- Wait, what?

03:18.532 --> 03:22.301
I have volunteered to be
Sofia's Protector steed.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.870
Great. Now that we've got
that out of the way...

03:24.872 --> 03:26.672
But Sofia already
has a steed.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.173
Oh? Where?

03:28.175 --> 03:29.741
Right here. Me.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.843
Because I also
volunteer to...

03:31.845 --> 03:33.912
to do the thing.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.814
You want to be
a Protector steed?

03:35.816 --> 03:37.149
Sure. Why not?

03:37.151 --> 03:39.084
Wow. I am impressed.

03:39.086 --> 03:41.753
I mean, it's not often
a Protector in training

03:41.755 --> 03:43.188
gets two offers
like this.

03:43.190 --> 03:44.690
So who's
it gonna be,

03:44.692 --> 03:47.559
the unicorn
or the flying donkey?

03:47.561 --> 03:49.161
Again with
the flying donkey?

03:49.163 --> 03:51.930
So I have to pick
just one?

03:51.932 --> 03:52.831
Uh-huh.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.866
And I don't
mean to rush you,

03:54.868 --> 03:56.768
but we really
gotta get moving.

03:56.770 --> 03:59.938
Chrysta, could I talk
to you in private
for a moment?

03:59.940 --> 04:01.907
Okay. Sure.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.442
Excuse me, guys.

04:03.444 --> 04:06.345
You want me to choose
between an old friend

04:06.347 --> 04:08.413
- and a new one?
- Uh-huh.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.782
But how am I
supposed to do that?

04:10.784 --> 04:12.951
Pick the one
who'll help you the most.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.254
Personally, I'd go
with the unicorn.

04:15.256 --> 04:16.788
But, you know,
that's just me.

04:16.790 --> 04:17.856
- Can't I take both?
- No.

04:17.858 --> 04:19.625
Is that a rule?

04:19.627 --> 04:22.561
Well, no, it's
more of a guideline.

04:22.563 --> 04:25.430
Good, because I really
feel like I should take both.

04:25.432 --> 04:28.734
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

04:28.736 --> 04:31.770
Because even a princess
can't fly two horses
at the same time.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.939
Yeah, but...
how can I tell

04:33.941 --> 04:36.642
who will be
the better Protector steed

04:36.644 --> 04:38.877
if I don't try
them both out first?

04:38.879 --> 04:40.779
I guess that
makes sense.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.547
I'm glad we're
in agreement.

04:42.549 --> 04:45.450
Good news, guys.
We're all going.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.785
BOTH: Great!
What?!

04:46.787 --> 04:49.154
Think of it
as a try-out.

04:49.156 --> 04:51.256
Whichever one of you
does better on this assignment
will get the job permanently.

04:51.258 --> 04:54.926
I think it's pretty obvious
who that's gonna be.

04:54.928 --> 04:57.796
Indeed it is,
but do not feel bad.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.798
After all,
I am a unicorn.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.400
I meant me.

05:02.403 --> 05:05.003
¶ Our long and famous
history ¶

05:05.005 --> 05:08.407
¶ Will show that
I'm the one you need ¶

05:08.409 --> 05:10.609
¶ And there can be
no mystery ¶

05:10.611 --> 05:14.079
¶ For I am
your Protector steed ¶

05:14.081 --> 05:16.815
¶ They counted us out
when they knocked us down ¶

05:16.817 --> 05:19.451
¶ But we gave it
another try ¶

05:19.453 --> 05:22.654
¶ Then we beat them all
and we won the crown ¶

05:22.656 --> 05:24.823
¶ 'Cause that's just
how we fly ¶

05:24.825 --> 05:27.826
¶ We're like arrows
through the sky ¶

05:27.828 --> 05:31.096
¶ Pick me,
do I need to mention ¶

05:31.098 --> 05:33.365
¶ We've been
side by side ¶

05:33.367 --> 05:36.702
¶ To the kingdom's end
and back again ¶

05:36.704 --> 05:39.938
¶ It fills my heart
with pride ¶

05:39.940 --> 05:42.474
¶ Pick me,
do I need to mention ¶

05:42.476 --> 05:44.843
¶ I'm a unicorn ¶

05:44.845 --> 05:48.480
¶ I'm the noblest steed,
I'm what you need ¶

05:48.482 --> 05:52.017
¶ A rose without
a single thorn ¶

05:52.986 --> 05:56.288
¶ And I got a horn ¶

05:56.290 --> 05:59.558
¶ I don't get lost,
I don't get mad ¶

05:59.560 --> 06:02.294
¶ On that you have
my sacred word ¶

06:02.296 --> 06:05.163
¶ And I would add,
I'm a unicorn ¶

06:05.165 --> 06:08.533
¶ In case you somehow
had not heard ¶

06:08.535 --> 06:11.036
¶ With me as your guide,
we will never fail ¶

06:11.038 --> 06:13.138
¶ We'll be poetry in flight ¶

06:13.140 --> 06:16.908
¶ Well, if he's a poem,
we're an epic tale ¶

06:16.910 --> 06:19.177
¶ With chapters
left to write ¶

06:19.179 --> 06:22.180
¶ Hey, there's no need
to pick a fight ¶

06:22.182 --> 06:25.484
¶ Just pick me,
do I need to mention ¶

06:25.486 --> 06:27.886
¶ There's no time to lose ¶

06:27.888 --> 06:31.089
¶ 'Cause your job depends on
how all this ends ¶

06:31.091 --> 06:33.358
¶ And who you choose
to choose ¶

06:33.360 --> 06:37.028
¶ Pick me,
do I need to mention ¶

06:37.030 --> 06:39.364
¶ I'm loyal as can be ¶

06:39.366 --> 06:41.099
¶ As your friend,
I'm sworn ¶

06:41.101 --> 06:43.001
¶ But I'm a unicorn ¶

06:43.003 --> 06:46.671
¶ The answer's obviously,
pick me ¶

06:46.673 --> 06:48.907
¶ Pick me,
pick me! ¶

06:48.909 --> 06:51.777
Hey, over here.
Pick me!

06:53.881 --> 06:56.348
- ¶ Pick me ¶
- ¶ Pick me! ¶

06:56.350 --> 06:59.751
¶ Pick me ¶

07:10.364 --> 07:13.031
Welcome to
the Isle of Unicorns.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.967
This area here is called
the Veil of Mist.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.536
Is this where
we find the mare?

07:17.538 --> 07:20.105
It is, but
it's not gonna be easy.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.607
She's skittish,
and she moves quick.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.876
I can keep up;
I'm really fast.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.812
Yes, but can you
see her in the mist?

07:26.814 --> 07:28.580
Guys, please.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.982
Okay, you gotta get
the Mare of the Mist

07:30.984 --> 07:32.584
to give you a single
strand from her mane.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.319
That's going to be
the bowstring

07:34.321 --> 07:36.455
- for my WhichWay bow?
- Correct. Two things though.

07:36.457 --> 07:39.124
Number one, she'll only
give you the bowstring

07:39.126 --> 07:40.826
if you're true of heart.

07:40.828 --> 07:43.094
There's no one
more true of heart
than Sofia.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.096
On this, we agree.

07:45.098 --> 07:48.967
But prithee, what does
true of heart mean exactly?

07:48.969 --> 07:50.402
That you do
what you know is right,

07:50.404 --> 07:52.170
no matter what
anyone else says.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.973
Oh, yes, that is
definitely my princess.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.409
Then there's
nothing to worry about,

07:57.411 --> 07:59.945
except number two.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.813
The mare only comes out
one day a year,

08:01.815 --> 08:03.348
so you gotta do it
by sundown.

08:03.350 --> 08:05.083
Sundown. Got it.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.953
Okay then, I'll wait
for you right here.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.621
- Off you go.
- Right.

08:09.623 --> 08:11.490
Who should I ride?

08:11.492 --> 08:13.859
I did come here
on Minimus.

08:13.861 --> 08:16.194
And it was
pretty perfect, right?

08:16.196 --> 08:18.930
Yes, but Skye hasn't had
a chance yet.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.999
Listen, princess,
a Protector doesn't mess around

08:21.001 --> 08:22.834
when they're in a hurry,

08:22.836 --> 08:26.204
saying, "Maybe I'll do this,
maybe I'll do that."

08:26.206 --> 08:29.074
No, a Protector decides
what to do, and does it.

08:30.711 --> 08:33.044
Okay, I'll go with
Skye this time.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.213
Sorry, Minimus.
You follow behind us?

08:35.215 --> 08:36.948
Uh, sure.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.217
Climb aboard,
my princess.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.919
Good luck.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.127
Was there something
you wanted?

08:49.129 --> 08:50.662
Nope, just keeping
an eye out,

08:50.664 --> 08:52.564
making sure
you're both okay.

08:52.566 --> 08:55.100
Thank you.
We are fine, sir.

09:02.009 --> 09:04.175
Look. Is that her?

09:04.177 --> 09:05.477
SKYE: 'Tis she.

09:05.479 --> 09:07.879
So beautiful.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.681
Chrysta said
she's skittish, guys,

09:09.683 --> 09:11.049
so let's be quiet.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.717
You got it, Sofia.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.352
And if you decide
to fly the rest of the way,

09:14.354 --> 09:16.187
- I'm your guy.
- That's okay.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.690
I'm going to walk
up to her slowly

09:18.692 --> 09:20.058
so I don't
scare her off.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.060
Besides, it's
still my turn.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.496
- She just rode you.
- Only for a few minutes.

09:24.498 --> 09:28.266
- ( whinnies )
- Guys, quiet! Remember?

09:28.268 --> 09:30.502
She's right.
You stand thither,

09:30.504 --> 09:34.072
I'll stand yon.
Thither and yon.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.074
I got it, I got it,
I'm yon.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.443
- No, you're thither.
- No, you're thither.

09:38.445 --> 09:40.579
- No I'm yon.
- Get your thither
outta my yon.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.981
( both arguing loudly )

09:46.887 --> 09:48.687
- We're fine.
- Yep, we're fine.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.956
Your arguing
scared the mare off.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.924
You're supposed
to be helping me.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.292
Hey, how you doing?

09:54.294 --> 09:55.961
Got your bowstring yet?

09:55.963 --> 09:58.296
Um, not yet, Chrysta.

09:58.298 --> 10:01.232
We found her, but
we may have scared her off.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.201
Sorry about that.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.737
- I blame myself.
And him.
- ( growls )

10:05.739 --> 10:07.105
Okay, two things.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.941
Number one, I told you
taking both of them

10:09.943 --> 10:12.277
would be trouble.
And number two,

10:12.279 --> 10:14.579
hurry up; you have
a job to do, princess!

10:14.581 --> 10:16.247
So what should we do?

10:16.249 --> 10:19.985
Well, first, the two of you
have to try to get along better.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.486
BOTH: Agreed.

10:21.488 --> 10:24.322
And we have to find
the mare again.

10:24.324 --> 10:27.292
Is that her yonder,
in the sky?

10:27.294 --> 10:28.727
MINIMUS: It's
just a cloud.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.295
Methinks 'tis she.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.130
Methinks it's a cloud.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.132
Guys, she ran off
this way.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.134
She left tracks.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.402
Told you
it was a cloud.

10:39.306 --> 10:42.474
She must've taken off
right here.

10:42.476 --> 10:45.176
Look. Way up there.
It's her.

10:46.580 --> 10:48.647
( whinnies )

10:48.649 --> 10:50.115
See? It is her.

10:50.117 --> 10:52.083
Who shall you ride,
my princess?

10:52.085 --> 10:53.585
I'll go with Minimus,

10:53.587 --> 10:55.687
because he's faster.
Sorry, Skye.

10:55.689 --> 10:58.356
As you wish,
my princess.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.067
There!
We're gaining on her.

11:27.154 --> 11:29.187
Where'd she go?
Can you see her?

11:29.189 --> 11:31.189
Minimus?

11:31.191 --> 11:33.358
Are we lost?

11:33.360 --> 11:36.227
It's possible.

11:36.229 --> 11:39.164
- Where is the mare?
- We lost her in the mist.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.965
Perhaps I might
be of assistance.

11:42.803 --> 11:45.637
Skye, that's fantastic.

11:45.639 --> 11:47.338
We can use
your light to find her.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.007
Hop on, my princess.

11:49.009 --> 11:50.742
I'm sorry, Minimus.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.911
Skye's horn
can light the way.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.312
I'm going with him.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.314
- All right,
but be careful.
- I will.

11:56.316 --> 11:57.916
Here I come, Skye.

11:59.853 --> 12:03.688
Onward, my princess.
We shall find your
elusive quarry.

12:03.690 --> 12:05.223
Stay close, Minimus.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.228
Was that the mare?

12:10.230 --> 12:11.996
Nay. 'Twas a Highcliff hawk.

12:11.998 --> 12:14.232
- Are you sure?
- This area is
home to them.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.900
Ahead there.
Do you see?

12:15.902 --> 12:18.336
Yes. That's the mare.

12:18.338 --> 12:19.671
Good job, Skye.

12:19.673 --> 12:21.372
I shall get you
to her, my princess.

12:21.374 --> 12:24.275
Not if I get
to her first.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.913
You missed her, Skye.
The mare went this way.

12:28.915 --> 12:32.350
- Follow me.
- Wait, Minimus.
That's not the mare.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.419
Shall I follow him...

12:34.421 --> 12:35.920
or the Mare of the Mist?

12:35.922 --> 12:37.789
Um, I don't know.

12:37.791 --> 12:40.391
Come on, Sofia,
think like a Protector.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.794
Okay, let's follow Minimus.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.763
I don't want him
to get lost in the mist.

12:44.765 --> 12:46.364
As you wish,
my princess.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.567
Minimus!

12:49.569 --> 12:51.436
Minimus!

12:51.438 --> 12:53.037
Hey, how we doin', Sof?

12:53.039 --> 12:55.273
Great. Super.
Almost done.

12:55.275 --> 12:59.310
Good, 'cause, uh,
tick-tock, you're
runnin' out of time.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.279
Sorry. Have to
call you back.

13:01.281 --> 13:04.349
- I'm right behind her.
- But Minimus...

13:08.221 --> 13:10.622
Whew, that was close.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.163
Is everyone okay?

13:18.165 --> 13:20.832
- I am unharmed.
- I think so.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.433
You don't look
so okay to me.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.903
Chrysta, how did
you find us?

13:24.905 --> 13:27.505
You kidding me?
With all the noise
you're making?

13:27.507 --> 13:28.973
So what happened?

13:28.975 --> 13:31.342
We, uh, we...

13:31.344 --> 13:32.911
we lost the mare.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.846
We followed
a hawk instead.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.481
We didn't follow
a hawk.

13:36.483 --> 13:39.284
I did.
It's my fault.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.586
- It's not your fault.
- You're right.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.454
It's your fault, Sofia.

13:43.456 --> 13:46.858
This happened because
you couldn't pick
just one steed.

13:46.860 --> 13:48.326
I know.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.329
It's just so hard
to choose between my friends.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.665
I'm sure it is, Sofia.

13:53.667 --> 13:55.967
But this is your job.

13:55.969 --> 13:57.969
If you wanna get
your bowstring

13:57.971 --> 14:00.471
and be a Protector,
you gotta make a choice.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.507
Right now.

14:04.144 --> 14:07.545
Minimus, you're one of
my best friends, but...

14:07.547 --> 14:10.481
But Skye's better
at this, I get it.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.550
He does know
the Mystic Isles.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.853
He knew about
those hawks,

14:14.855 --> 14:16.487
and you heard Chrysta.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.323
I have to pick.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.158
Whatever you say,
Sofia.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.327
See you back at
the stables,

14:22.329 --> 14:25.096
if you ever happen
by that way again.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.334
Oh, Minimus.

14:29.336 --> 14:31.369
Okay, that's settled.
Now you need to get
back to work.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.371
This doesn't feel right.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.541
Trust me, you have
a better chance of
finding the mare now.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.042
And you learned
a couple of things.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.545
Number one,
always listen to me,

14:40.547 --> 14:43.414
and number two, mm,
okay, there is no number two.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.816
I shouldn't have
made him go.

14:44.818 --> 14:47.819
Minimus, come back!

14:47.821 --> 14:49.721
Princess, there's
no time for that.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.589
You're running
out of daylight.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.324
Come, my princess.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.360
I will help you
complete the task.

14:55.362 --> 14:57.228
( sighs )
Okay.

14:57.230 --> 15:00.565
Next time I see
you, you'll have
that bowstring, right?

15:00.567 --> 15:02.166
Right.

15:14.848 --> 15:17.081
Look. There she is.

15:25.225 --> 15:26.891
My name is
Princess Sofia,

15:26.893 --> 15:30.295
and I'm training to be
the Protector of the Ever Realm.

15:30.297 --> 15:33.131
Yes, I know
who you are.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.868
Mare of the Mist,
may I please have

15:36.870 --> 15:41.272
a hair from your mane
so I can string
my WhichWay bow?

15:41.274 --> 15:44.475
- No. You may not.
- No?

15:44.477 --> 15:46.477
Only those who are
true of heart

15:46.479 --> 15:49.881
are worthy of
a magical bowstring.

15:53.219 --> 15:55.653
Wait! Come back!

15:55.655 --> 15:58.823
I don't understand,
my princess.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.658
You are completely
worthy.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.660
No, I'm not.

16:02.662 --> 16:05.663
I have no bowstring,
the mare is gone,

16:05.665 --> 16:07.632
I'm apparently
not true of heart,

16:07.634 --> 16:11.469
and my friend is
probably lost out there
in the mist.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.904
So what shall we do?

16:12.906 --> 16:14.772
What we should've
done before.

16:14.774 --> 16:17.141
We're going to get
Minimus back.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.577
But what about
the WhichWay bow?

16:19.579 --> 16:21.846
That doesn't matter
right now, Skye.

16:21.848 --> 16:24.282
If being a Protector
means sending my friend away,

16:24.284 --> 16:27.485
then maybe I'm not
supposed to be a Protector.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.988
As you wish,
my princess.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.324
Ow!

16:33.326 --> 16:36.394
Ran into that rock before
a couple of times.

16:37.831 --> 16:41.165
Ow. And the hawk's nest again.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.501
I'm going in circles.
Story of my life.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.269
( straining )

16:45.271 --> 16:47.472
Oh, I'm stuck.

16:47.474 --> 16:49.674
I'm never
gonna get outta here.

16:53.046 --> 16:55.546
Minimus, where are you?

16:55.548 --> 16:57.548
Minimus!

16:57.550 --> 16:58.716
( screeching )

16:58.718 --> 17:00.718
Sorry. I'm trying.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.121
( all screeching )

17:03.123 --> 17:05.189
- Minimus!
- What was that?

17:05.191 --> 17:07.658
- I could swear I heard...
- Minimus!

17:07.660 --> 17:09.327
Minimus!!

17:09.329 --> 17:11.396
Sofia? Sofia!

17:11.398 --> 17:13.998
She's looking for me.
Sofia, I'm over here.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.200
( screeching )

17:16.202 --> 17:18.736
It's him. It sounds
like he's in trouble.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.171
Go, Skye!

17:20.173 --> 17:22.573
I shall fly like
the gale of a hurricane.

17:22.575 --> 17:25.476
Oh... oh, hurry, Sofia.

17:27.147 --> 17:29.180
Excuse us, hawk family.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.581
Pardon me.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.250
I'm just trying
to get to my friend.

17:32.252 --> 17:34.485
Minimus, follow us.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.731
Oh! I'm so glad
to see you.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.099
I was sort of
completely lost,

17:48.101 --> 17:49.834
and then, there were
the hawks, and then...

17:49.836 --> 17:51.736
I'm sorry, Minimus.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.439
It was wrong of me
to choose between you two.

17:54.441 --> 17:56.441
You both
are important to me.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.242
No, it was my fault.
I blew it.

17:58.244 --> 18:01.045
I don't blame you
for choosing Skye.

18:01.047 --> 18:03.214
I must apologize
as well.

18:03.216 --> 18:07.051
My conduct toward you
was unbecoming
of a unicorn.

18:07.053 --> 18:08.686
No, no, it was me.

18:08.688 --> 18:11.089
I was jealous of you
the minute I saw you.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.757
Jealous of me?

18:12.759 --> 18:15.726
But Sofia chose you
over the WhichWay bow.

18:15.728 --> 18:18.229
What? No,
you didn't. Sofia?

18:18.231 --> 18:20.298
You're my friend.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.233
I should never
have told you to leave.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.202
You are right.
'Tis I who should go.

18:24.204 --> 18:27.038
Minimus is your brave
and loyal friend.

18:27.040 --> 18:29.774
If you were true to
yourself, Princess Sofia,

18:29.776 --> 18:32.777
you would've chosen him
as your Protector steed, not I.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.913
Skye, you're
absolutely right.

18:35.915 --> 18:37.715
Farewell,
my princess.

18:37.717 --> 18:41.085
May you and Minimus
have a joyous partnership.

18:41.087 --> 18:42.787
No, no, no,
not about that.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.723
About being
true to my heart.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.291
Minimus, while
you were gone,

18:47.293 --> 18:50.161
the mare refused to give me
a strand of her mane.

18:50.163 --> 18:52.630
What? She thinks you're
not true of heart?

18:52.632 --> 18:55.299
Well, I'm gonna give her
a piece of my mind.

18:55.301 --> 18:57.668
No, she was right.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.403
Chrysta said
being true of heart

18:59.405 --> 19:02.073
is doing what you think
is right, no matter what.

19:02.075 --> 19:03.774
When I told you to go,

19:03.776 --> 19:06.410
I wasn't doing
what I thought was right.

19:06.412 --> 19:08.679
That's why the mare
didn't give me the bowstring.

19:08.681 --> 19:11.349
Maybe she'd give you
a strand of her mane now.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.750
Do you think
we can find her?

19:12.752 --> 19:14.485
BOTH: The day's
not over yet.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.521
We said that
at the same time.

19:16.523 --> 19:17.855
( both laughing )

19:17.857 --> 19:19.257
Come on.
We have to hurry.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.459
You must take Minimus.
He's faster.

19:21.461 --> 19:24.095
But Skye's glowing horn
would light the way.

19:24.097 --> 19:27.098
- Go with him.
- Even better,
we'll work together.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.300
Skye, a little
light, please.

19:29.302 --> 19:31.836
Let us soar,
good Minimus.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.854
SOFIA: There she is!

19:55.461 --> 19:56.827
Excuse me.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.329
Miss Mare.

19:58.331 --> 20:01.132
It's me again.
Sofia.

20:01.134 --> 20:03.801
When I saw you earlier,
you were right.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.903
I wasn't true of heart.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.872
I picked a new friend
over an old one,

20:07.874 --> 20:10.541
and I knew it wasn't
the right thing to do.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.810
But I hope you'll see
I've learned.

20:12.812 --> 20:15.079
Mare of the Mist,
may I please have

20:15.081 --> 20:16.347
a hair from your mane?

20:16.349 --> 20:18.883
Princess Sofia,
you have indeed

20:18.885 --> 20:23.120
shown yourself to be
true of heart.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.157
Thank you.

20:26.159 --> 20:28.226
May you use it wisely.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.332
You did it!

20:34.334 --> 20:36.434
Well done,
my princess!

20:36.436 --> 20:38.236
Light her up, Skye.

20:38.238 --> 20:40.438
Let's go find Chrysta
and tell her the good news.

20:42.342 --> 20:46.444
Uh... would either of
you perhaps recall
where she might be?

20:46.446 --> 20:48.379
Don't ask me.

20:48.381 --> 20:50.548
I couldn't find her
with four hooves and a map.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.783
Wait. The WhichWay bow.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.318
BOTH: Why didn't
I think of that?

20:55.922 --> 20:58.089
String the bow,
pull it back.

20:58.091 --> 21:00.024
Whoa, okay.

21:00.026 --> 21:01.926
Take us back
to Chrysta, please.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.741
Looks like someone
got her bowstring.

21:16.743 --> 21:18.876
And look who's back.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.444
I couldn't have
done it without them.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.146
Both of them.

21:22.148 --> 21:25.950
So you followed your heart,
no matter what anyone else said.

21:25.952 --> 21:28.252
Even me.
Nicely done.

21:28.254 --> 21:32.556
But you still gotta answer
one last question.

21:32.558 --> 21:34.759
Who's going to be
my Protector steed?

21:34.761 --> 21:36.794
Right. Who's gonna
fly with you

21:36.796 --> 21:39.130
in all your
future assignments?

21:39.132 --> 21:40.965
I know exactly
who to choose.

21:40.967 --> 21:44.235
- Skye.
- I am honored.

21:44.237 --> 21:46.804
But would you not
be better served by
the noble Minimus?

21:46.806 --> 21:49.173
No one could serve me
better in the Mystic Isles

21:49.175 --> 21:50.975
than you, Skye.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.110
But back home,
in the Ever Realm,

21:53.112 --> 21:55.579
no one can serve me
better than Minimus.

21:55.581 --> 21:56.947
Oh, hmmm.

21:56.949 --> 21:58.149
Interesting.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.784
BOTH: Sounds good to me!

21:59.786 --> 22:01.852
Well, it's never
been done before,

22:01.854 --> 22:04.422
but we've never had
a Protector like you before.

22:04.424 --> 22:06.023
So I can have both?

22:06.025 --> 22:08.426
Sure. Why not?

22:08.428 --> 22:10.995
We make a great team.

22:10.997 --> 22:13.864
Ahem. Yeah,
that's really sweet.

22:13.866 --> 22:16.033
But can you use
that WhichWay bow
to take us home?

22:16.035 --> 22:18.102
I sure can.

22:18.104 --> 22:21.172
WhichWay bow,
show us the way home.
