00:01.000 --> 00:02.127
Previously on "Alias":

00:02.202 --> 00:04.170
I got her. Blonde hair, brown jacket.

00:08.508 --> 00:09.600
Hi there.

00:09.676 --> 00:12.873
- How much does she know?
- Dean calls it "The Shed. "

00:12.946 --> 00:15.744
She was recruited two years ago.
Computer specialist.

00:15.815 --> 00:17.544
She's willing to give us everything.

00:17.617 --> 00:19.847
- What is it?
- We need some help.

00:19.919 --> 00:23.320
You have to walk back into that office
and look everyone in the eye.

00:23.390 --> 00:26.052
You can't let them see
that you know the truth.

00:26.126 --> 00:29.892
Rachel. I need a prep report
by the end of the day.

00:29.963 --> 00:31.692
OK. I'll get right on it.

00:31.765 --> 00:34.632
- I think we may have a problem.
- What kind of problem?

00:34.701 --> 00:37.636
- Rachel Gibson.
- She's copying everything on my server.

00:37.704 --> 00:39.467
Execute plan B.

00:40.273 --> 00:42.070
They set off an EMP, fried the electronics.

00:43.143 --> 00:44.701
(alarm)

00:52.118 --> 00:55.144
She's OK. She's gonna be OK.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:36.362 --> 01:38.592
Thank you. Can I have the dice?

01:41.501 --> 01:44.937
You guys seem a little wound up.
Let's loosen it up a little bit.

01:45.004 --> 01:48.303
Come on! Loosen it up! Get out the kinks.

01:55.982 --> 01:58.746
It's that easy. I can't even help it.
Bring 'em back!

02:01.221 --> 02:06.488
That's right. There we go! Come on!
Mama would love a new pair of shoes!

02:18.037 --> 02:22.497
Tell your pit boss we need more money.
We're feeling lucky tonight.

02:32.919 --> 02:34.181
Ready?

02:36.823 --> 02:41.453
Oh, did I win? I wasn't paying attention.
I can't even help it. I can't help it.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.635
And it is that easy.

02:49.702 --> 02:52.262
(French accent) This is disgusting.

02:52.338 --> 02:53.930
Can I help you, Frenchman?

02:54.007 --> 02:58.467
You're pregnant. You should not be
in a casino. You should be at home.

02:58.545 --> 03:02.003
Do you feel at home, baby?
We feel at home. Thank you.

03:05.285 --> 03:07.719
Oh, you're gonna bet against me?

03:08.588 --> 03:10.954
Good luck with that.

03:20.800 --> 03:23.268
Bon sang!

03:23.336 --> 03:25.566
Don't give me that look. I warned you.

03:25.638 --> 03:27.128
C'est pas possible!

03:31.978 --> 03:34.105
This table's gone cold.

03:43.089 --> 03:46.422
Madame, could we please
have a word with you?

03:52.365 --> 03:55.357
Sir, this is insane.
Do you have any idea who I am?

03:55.435 --> 03:59.030
- Sit down.
- I will not! I've done nothing wrong.

04:03.142 --> 04:04.973
Sit down.

04:07.880 --> 04:11.247
I have seen some despicable acts
of cheating in my time.

04:11.317 --> 04:14.445
But a pregnant woman using her own baby
to escape suspicion...

04:14.520 --> 04:19.149
- I don't know how you live with yourself.
- What can I say, sir?

04:20.493 --> 04:22.723
I'm not like other moms.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.858
Outrigger, I'm on my way to the vault.

04:34.674 --> 04:39.805
Sidewinder, I'm approaching the vault.
What's your status?

04:40.580 --> 04:44.778
- Sidewinder?
- Sidewinder needs a little more time.

04:59.065 --> 05:01.795
I'm at the vault. I need that key code.

05:01.868 --> 05:04.098
- Got it. Ready when you are.
- Go.

05:04.170 --> 05:07.628
9-7-3-2-6-3-4-7.

05:14.080 --> 05:17.516
- I've got the package. Meet you in front.
- All right.

05:37.470 --> 05:40.462
- This is Phoenix. We have the archive.
- Any complications?

05:40.540 --> 05:45.068
Well, I think I lost us about $900,000,
depending on the exchange rate.

05:45.144 --> 05:48.443
- Copy that. What's your location?
- I'm approaching the ferry now.

05:48.514 --> 05:50.448
Have a safe trip.

06:32.592 --> 06:35.959
(phone rings)

06:38.498 --> 06:40.432
- Hello?
- You have something of mine.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.663
- Who is this?
- I want my property back.

06:43.736 --> 06:46.330
I want Mockingbird.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.395
What?

06:47.473 --> 06:51.807
Have your people deliver Mockingbird
to me within the hour. or I will drop you.

06:51.878 --> 06:54.745
This is a mistake.
I don't know what Mockingbird is.

06:54.814 --> 06:58.011
- You're wasting time.
- Please, what is Mockingbird?

07:10.096 --> 07:11.791
Rachel.

07:12.965 --> 07:15.092
You should eat something.

07:16.869 --> 07:19.133
You need to eat, you need rest.

07:19.205 --> 07:21.696
- The debriefing can wait.
- No, it can't.

07:21.774 --> 07:25.107
I know what you're going through.
You need to give yourself time.

07:25.178 --> 07:27.772
It can't wait.

07:33.853 --> 07:37.755
I'm held together by a string right now,
Ms. Bristow.

07:37.824 --> 07:41.726
A week ago,
I had a good job working for the ClA.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.319
Now I have the truth.

07:44.397 --> 07:49.061
My job was a front for a mercenary
organization, and my boss is a criminal,

07:49.135 --> 07:52.229
and my coworkers are all dead.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.832
- Because I got them killed.
- It wasn't your fault.

07:55.908 --> 07:58.775
They'd all be alive
if I hadn't walked into that building.

07:58.845 --> 08:02.372
Your boss, Gordon Dean...

08:02.448 --> 08:04.245
he killed them, not you.

08:04.317 --> 08:09.254
It doesn't change the fact that every time
I close my eyes, I see their faces.

08:09.322 --> 08:14.157
So I need to give you everything I have...
right now,

08:14.227 --> 08:18.561
because the sooner I'm finished,
the sooner this is over.

08:22.568 --> 08:27.005
Rachel, first of all, just don't call me
Ms. Bristow. It's Sydney.

08:27.073 --> 08:32.477
Secondly, your information will go a long
way towards helping us find Gordon Dean.

08:32.544 --> 08:35.946
We will get the people responsible for this.

08:36.948 --> 08:39.941
Then I'd better get back to work.

08:41.254 --> 08:42.982
Oh...

08:43.054 --> 08:47.287
By the way, a name keeps coming up
in your data - "Mockingbird."

08:47.360 --> 08:50.352
- We don't have a base reference for it.
- Oh.

08:50.429 --> 08:54.365
Sorry. It's a briefing habit.

08:54.433 --> 08:57.732
I take it for granted.
It's my agency call sign.

08:58.738 --> 09:00.262
It's me.

09:01.908 --> 09:04.502
I'm Mockingbird.

09:34.206 --> 09:36.902
I have an assignment suited
to your abilities.

09:36.976 --> 09:40.309
I'll leave the approach to your discretion.

09:40.379 --> 09:43.542
I assume you're familiar with the target.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.741
I am.

09:46.819 --> 09:51.051
You'll have our full resources
at your disposal.

09:51.123 --> 09:53.057
You have resources?

09:53.559 --> 09:57.928
Don't let the appearance fool you.
We're in the midst of a relocation.

09:57.997 --> 09:59.862
I'll keep you updated.

10:03.469 --> 10:07.132
- I need money.
- Where are we on the satellite offices?

10:07.206 --> 10:10.300
Cleveland, Seattle, Chicago -
they've all been abandoned.

10:10.376 --> 10:13.573
We beat the ClA by about an hour
at the St. Louis office.

10:13.646 --> 10:17.377
- They find anything?
- Extension cords and surge protectors.

10:17.450 --> 10:20.078
Alternate location should be set up
by day's end.

10:20.152 --> 10:22.950
We've got the account transfers ready
across the board.

10:23.022 --> 10:26.048
I just need your pass code
for the withdrawals.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.119
God, you're paranoid.

10:31.197 --> 10:33.927
That's why I'm still alive.

10:35.434 --> 10:39.336
I got him. I've been monitoring
Dean's bank accounts based on your intel.

10:39.405 --> 10:42.169
30 minutes ago,
he liquidated every single one of them.

10:42.241 --> 10:46.200
Our infiltration in Prague must have him
concerned. He's covering his tracks.

10:46.278 --> 10:50.078
Right. But not to worry, because
I'm a bit of a master tracker myself.

10:50.149 --> 10:53.141
I'm kind of like a Comanche lndian -

10:53.219 --> 10:56.313
Comanche lndian who tracks data.

10:56.389 --> 11:00.758
He consolidated all his funds, deposited
them into one account designated...

11:00.826 --> 11:05.525
1 01 7. It's the agency fail-safe account
in the Cayman lslands.

11:05.598 --> 11:09.261
I set it up. 1 0/1 7 is my birthday.

11:09.335 --> 11:13.931
Dean's money is in one place? If we seize
his funds, we can cripple his operation.

11:14.006 --> 11:18.875
You won't be able to do it.
It's a trapdoor account. It can't be hacked.

11:18.944 --> 11:22.436
You access it at the bank,
and you need the pre-arranged responses

11:22.515 --> 11:24.506
to Dean's protocol questions.

11:24.583 --> 11:29.987
The only answer set is on Dean's server
in the Prague office, which he destroyed.

11:30.890 --> 11:32.221
I know how he works.

11:32.291 --> 11:35.488
The only copy of his protocol was
in the building he blew up.

11:35.561 --> 11:37.688
There's nothing left.

11:41.801 --> 11:42.961
What?

11:43.035 --> 11:46.368
Czech authorities have begun
investigating the bombings.

11:46.439 --> 11:48.566
We've accessed their site inventories,

11:48.641 --> 11:53.544
and they have catalogued
already several BR-46 servers.

11:53.612 --> 11:54.636
That's them.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.774
Marshall's designed EM recovery software.

11:57.850 --> 12:01.980
- We can reconstruct the protocol.
- Here's the problem.

12:02.054 --> 12:06.491
The BlS won't release their evidence
until they finish their investigation.

12:06.559 --> 12:11.189
So I'm going back to Prague.
I need you to come with me.

12:13.432 --> 12:16.230
- No. Absolutely not.
- Rachel...

12:16.302 --> 12:18.133
You want me to dig through that building.

12:18.204 --> 12:22.937
If Dean transfers his assets before we can
access his account, we lose him entirely.

12:23.008 --> 12:26.876
I'm not going back there.
Those people are all dead because of me.

12:26.946 --> 12:28.846
I'm not going to search
through their remains.

12:28.914 --> 12:33.578
I wouldn't ask you to do this
if there was another way. Believe me.

12:33.652 --> 12:36.143
We need you to do this.

12:36.222 --> 12:39.316
We need you to go back into that building.

13:05.551 --> 13:10.545
Mr. Sloane, my name is Boyd Harkin.
I'm Special Prosecutor to your case.

13:11.223 --> 13:15.421
I'm required to inform you that,
under National Security Directive 1 1 5B,

13:15.494 --> 13:17.587
you do not quality for legal counsel.

13:17.663 --> 13:18.652
I understand.

13:18.731 --> 13:23.759
Deputy Director Miller, Undersecretary
Reeves and I have reviewed your case.

13:23.836 --> 13:27.567
The Justice Department accepts our
recommendation for your sentencing.

13:27.640 --> 13:31.736
Before we rule, however,
we have a few questions for you.

13:32.578 --> 13:35.604
- I'm prepared to cooperate.
- Good.

13:35.681 --> 13:39.242
A year ago, you signed a pardon
agreement with the Justice Department.

13:39.318 --> 13:42.116
What were the terms of that agreement?

13:42.188 --> 13:46.591
I was asked to oversee a black ops unit
for the ClA.

13:46.659 --> 13:51.153
In exchange for my participation,
I received a pardon for my crimes.

13:51.864 --> 13:54.196
Let's talk about those crimes.

13:55.134 --> 13:59.298
Your record reads like a veritable catalog
of illegal activity -

13:59.371 --> 14:03.535
multiple counts of murder,
conspiracy, treason.

14:04.476 --> 14:09.140
I don't understand how any pardon
resulting in your freedom could be justified.

14:09.215 --> 14:11.649
During the previous proceedings,

14:11.717 --> 14:16.518
the charges against me were carefully
considered before they were dismissed.

14:16.589 --> 14:20.753
As to whether the pardon itself
was justified...

14:20.826 --> 14:23.556
I suppose that's a question
for the Justice Department.

14:23.629 --> 14:27.190
Perhaps. But since I have you
in front of me right now,

14:27.266 --> 14:29.860
why don't we see if we can suss it out?

14:31.303 --> 14:32.827
Of course.

14:32.905 --> 14:35.601
We're scheduled to meet the emissary
at three.

14:35.674 --> 14:40.304
Sydney should be in Prague by now.
Give her two hours in and out of the site.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.210
Should have plenty of time to spare.

14:42.281 --> 14:46.115
- We know what this emissary looks like?
- He's got our descriptions.

14:46.185 --> 14:50.087
He'll escort us from the beach.
Helps keep the bank's location a secret.

14:50.155 --> 14:53.420
If he tries to blindfold us,
he may have a problem -

14:53.492 --> 14:56.518
I'm not in the mood for blindfolds today.

14:56.595 --> 14:57.857
Noted.

14:57.930 --> 15:00.455
What do we do till three?

15:00.532 --> 15:03.023
We wait.

15:19.685 --> 15:22.654
- I can't do this.
- We've got the easy job.

15:22.721 --> 15:25.519
Once we access the protocol,
we feed it to Tom and Dixon.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.924
They handle the heavy stuff.
We're out of there.

15:28.994 --> 15:35.126
There's a reason I work at a desk. I don't
like pressure, or death, for that matter.

15:35.200 --> 15:39.899
Listen to me.
I have to do unpleasant tasks all the time,

15:39.972 --> 15:43.100
and the best way to do it
is to become someone else.

15:43.175 --> 15:45.268
Where are the BlS badges?

15:45.878 --> 15:49.507
I'm not Sydney Bristow,
you're not Rachel Gibson.

15:49.581 --> 15:52.049
We're Czech lntelligence, Terrorism Unit.

15:52.117 --> 15:55.416
When we walk in that room,
we outrank everyone else. Act like it.

15:55.487 --> 16:00.288
Nothing in there can rattle us because
we see this type of thing every day.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.242
We see this every day.

16:26.185 --> 16:29.382
We see this every day.

16:33.258 --> 16:37.024
They've organized the debris
according to the building's floor plan.

16:37.096 --> 16:42.363
Everything in the office should be
where it was. You know, more or less.

16:49.675 --> 16:52.644
Which way do we go?

16:52.711 --> 16:55.179
Follow me.

17:42.861 --> 17:44.852
It should be right here.

17:44.930 --> 17:46.921
Let's get to work.

17:49.835 --> 17:53.794
Excuse me. Misters Taldash and White?

17:54.773 --> 17:58.106
My name is Pierpont.
I'm here to escort you to the bank.

17:58.177 --> 17:59.838
You're early.

17:59.912 --> 18:04.474
I'm merely following your account's
protocol. Is there a problem?

18:04.550 --> 18:07.110
Of course not. Excuse me.

18:13.258 --> 18:16.193
- Yeah, this is it.
- (cell phone rings)

18:17.729 --> 18:19.526
This is Mr. Taldash. room 440.

18:19.598 --> 18:22.658
I'm going to have to cancel my massage
this afternoon.

18:22.734 --> 18:25.862
I'm afraid I got my times mixed up.
Thank you.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.428
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

18:29.441 --> 18:33.377
That was Dixon. We don't have
as much time as we thought.

18:39.485 --> 18:41.476
(Rachel) Oh, God.

18:46.391 --> 18:47.722
Oh, God.

18:47.793 --> 18:51.820
It's OK. It's OK.
I'll just... I'll deal with the server.

18:51.897 --> 18:53.296
Go on.

18:53.365 --> 18:55.492
I have to get out of here.

18:55.567 --> 18:57.228
Rachel.

18:57.302 --> 19:02.604
Rachel, look at me. I'll handle the server,
but you have to tell me what to do.

19:03.442 --> 19:05.603
You need the hard drive.

19:05.677 --> 19:08.908
- Which one?
- Fifth. Fifth one down.

19:09.648 --> 19:11.843
Get the computer ready.

19:13.218 --> 19:15.311
Rachel...

19:24.463 --> 19:26.397
(Tom) So how far is the bank?

19:26.465 --> 19:29.957
- You've never been here before?
- This is our first time in the Caymans.

19:30.035 --> 19:34.028
Well, you're lucky.
The bank's not far today.

19:34.106 --> 19:37.075
We gave up our fixed location years ago.

19:43.081 --> 19:46.482
Technology allows us a certain fluidity.

19:46.552 --> 19:50.454
We find our clients prefer
our business remain mobile.

19:50.522 --> 19:55.983
Our clients, as I'm sure you're aware,
are highly security-conscious.

19:58.230 --> 19:59.822
Welcome to First Cayman Trust.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.980
Hook it up.

20:19.318 --> 20:21.684
Are the weapons necessary?

20:22.354 --> 20:27.348
They certainly won't be
if you know your account's protocol.

20:27.426 --> 20:29.417
Give me your hand.

20:32.564 --> 20:34.555
Hook it up.

20:38.103 --> 20:41.664
Gentlemen,
there are over 300 possible questions.

20:42.808 --> 20:47.438
- We've committed the answers to memory.
- Our boss is highly security-conscious.

20:47.512 --> 20:48.911
Of course.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.612
Here we go.

20:57.689 --> 21:00.920
"The select blood runs through..."

21:07.532 --> 21:10.729
- Do you need me to repeat the question?
- No.

21:10.802 --> 21:13.771
The select blood runs through...

21:16.775 --> 21:17.742
"Roquet's Heart."

21:17.809 --> 21:19.777
Roquet's Heart.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.644
"The future's history is written in..."

21:27.386 --> 21:29.581
"The ink of the past."
What are these questions?

21:29.655 --> 21:31.213
The ink of the past.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.985
"What the mirror reflects..."

21:33.058 --> 21:35.424
- "Lives eternal. "
- Lives eternal.

21:35.494 --> 21:38.327
"lf there was never a one, there was ever..."

21:46.672 --> 21:48.071
- Oh, no.
- What?

21:48.807 --> 21:50.172
The data's corrupt.

21:50.242 --> 21:54.178
"lf there was never a one, there was ever..."

21:54.246 --> 21:56.680
- This was yours.
- No. No, no.

21:56.748 --> 21:58.807
This... this was yours.

21:58.884 --> 22:01.011
I've heard Dean say this before.

22:02.521 --> 22:05.615
You had all the questions that rhymed,
remember?

22:05.691 --> 22:07.659
Yes. That's true.

22:07.726 --> 22:09.353
Gentlemen, I need an answer.

22:09.428 --> 22:12.829
If there was never a one, there was ever...

22:13.598 --> 22:16.260
- The twelve.
- The twelve.

22:16.802 --> 22:18.667
The twelve.

22:19.571 --> 22:20.833
I'm sorry.

22:20.906 --> 22:23.636
Gentlemen, we're at your service.

22:30.749 --> 22:32.979
Come on. Let's get out of here.

22:36.421 --> 22:38.218
It's over. Come on.

22:39.157 --> 22:42.615
Can I get you something to drink? A cigar?

22:42.694 --> 22:45.162
You know what? I'd love a drink.

22:52.771 --> 22:56.332
Someone accessed the 1 01 7 account.
They cleaned us out.

22:56.408 --> 22:58.933
- We lost everything.
- That's impossible.

22:59.010 --> 23:02.810
They were on site,
transferred from the Caymans.

23:04.316 --> 23:06.978
No one can do that.

23:07.052 --> 23:09.111
I am the only one with...

23:11.189 --> 23:16.092
She's still alive. Rachel Gibson's still alive.

23:18.263 --> 23:21.027
And they've got her in custody.

23:24.536 --> 23:26.561
We need to get her back.

23:31.543 --> 23:35.206
I'd like to turn our attention to Omnifam.

23:35.280 --> 23:38.443
For three years,
I ran a world relief organization

23:38.517 --> 23:40.417
dedicated to humanitarian causes.

23:40.485 --> 23:43.682
Which you used as a cover
for a genetic engineering project

23:43.755 --> 23:46.622
that almost caused a global genocide.

23:47.926 --> 23:50.588
- Yes.
- Yes?

23:50.662 --> 23:57.090
I just accused you of attempting to murder
millions. I hoped for a bit more than a "yes."

23:58.370 --> 24:05.173
For years, I was driven
by a misguided attempt to pursue...

24:06.111 --> 24:08.807
a higher power.

24:08.880 --> 24:13.715
I will not attempt to deny my wrongdoings.
There is no reason to.

24:13.785 --> 24:18.222
The government has pardoned me
for those actions.

24:18.290 --> 24:21.589
However, I am reformed.

24:26.465 --> 24:29.628
Two years ago, I learned I had a daughter.

24:30.836 --> 24:33.805
She has changed by life.

24:33.872 --> 24:36.238
Since the moment I met her,

24:37.042 --> 24:40.739
I have dedicated my every moment,

24:40.812 --> 24:42.803
every action,

24:43.915 --> 24:45.849
to atoning for my sins.

24:45.917 --> 24:47.908
Mr. Sloane,

24:47.986 --> 24:52.855
four months ago, you betrayed your
agency and participated in a conspiracy

24:52.924 --> 24:56.485
that caused the deaths
of thousands of people in Sovogda.

24:56.561 --> 24:59.052
How exactly is that atoning for your sins?

24:59.130 --> 25:02.190
I did not betray my agency.

25:02.267 --> 25:06.795
I was forced to go undercover to establish
credentials with Elena Derevko,

25:06.872 --> 25:10.603
and you should have corresponding
statements from the agents involved.

25:10.675 --> 25:13.371
Yes, I have the statements.

25:13.445 --> 25:17.347
Your colleagues seem to have bought
your hollow justifications,

25:17.415 --> 25:20.543
but I find your actions fit a pattern
of criminal behavior

25:20.619 --> 25:23.850
you have demonstrated your entire life.

25:23.922 --> 25:27.551
Time and again, you explain your crimes
as some sort of necessary evil.

25:27.626 --> 25:31.824
I find it shocking
people continue to believe your lies.

25:33.365 --> 25:38.701
In truth, these proceedings
are a mere formality.

25:38.770 --> 25:42.536
You will atone for your sins, Mr. Sloane.

25:42.607 --> 25:46.566
Only you don't get to decide
the punishment. We do.

25:56.555 --> 26:02.084
(Jack) Assuming the worst. it will happen
fast. You'll be transferred to a penitentiary.

26:02.160 --> 26:06.426
It's doubtful we'll have a chance
to go over your affairs,

26:06.498 --> 26:09.058
assuming they rule against you.

26:09.134 --> 26:11.932
They're going to rule against me.

26:16.675 --> 26:19.701
Thanks for getting Sydney and Marcus
to write statements on my behalf.

26:19.778 --> 26:25.011
- That must have been very difficult.
- They volunteered. I didn't have to ask.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.449
Well, thank them for me.

26:29.721 --> 26:33.054
I want to give you power of attorney
over Nadia.

26:33.124 --> 26:34.284
Of course.

26:34.359 --> 26:38.557
Promise me you'll do everything you can
to save her, Jack...

26:38.630 --> 26:41.360
as if she were your own daughter.

26:42.734 --> 26:45.100
You have my word.

26:45.170 --> 26:47.263
Thank you.

26:47.339 --> 26:50.035
He's scared.
The Cayman transfer was a success.

26:50.108 --> 26:53.305
We were able to take full control
of Dean's finances.

26:53.378 --> 26:58.315
As a result, he's getting sloppy,
making uncharacteristic mistakes.

26:58.383 --> 27:02.649
An hour ago, Echelon intercepted a call
Dean placed to Laurent Moreau,

27:02.721 --> 27:07.090
a business associate
Ms. Gibson flagged in her debriefings.

27:10.061 --> 27:12.359
- (Moreau) You lost everything.
- (Dean) It's a setback.

27:12.430 --> 27:15.797
We're moving forward. but I need
to retrieve my operations archives.

27:15.867 --> 27:17.835
(Moreau) You're blackmailing yourself?

27:17.902 --> 27:21.599
- Where are the archives. Laurent?
- Relax. They're safe at Rue L 'Or.

27:21.673 --> 27:25.006
- (Dean) I'll arrange transfer.
- Dean's going after his archives.

27:25.076 --> 27:28.307
If we can beat him to it,
we'd have access to Dean's operation.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.940
They said they're being held at Rue L'Or.
Where is that?

27:31.016 --> 27:34.543
Well, looks like it's in Monte Carlo.

27:34.619 --> 27:37.918
One of Moreau's fronts. Hey, it's a casino.

27:39.724 --> 27:41.817
What did we do with all that money
we seized?

27:53.705 --> 27:56.765
Having trouble sleeping, Mr. Sloane?

27:58.309 --> 27:59.936
I don't blame you.

28:00.011 --> 28:05.039
You'd have to count a lot of sheep to erase
today's proceedings, that's for sure.

28:05.116 --> 28:09.485
I'm guessing they're gonna put you away
for a long time...

28:11.456 --> 28:15.290
which is just too bad, really, because...

28:16.194 --> 28:22.463
it'll be awful hard to help that daughter
of yours from inside a federal penitentiary.

28:22.534 --> 28:25.628
Of course, it doesn't have to be that way.

28:26.638 --> 28:29.129
Huh, Mr. Sloane?

28:29.207 --> 28:32.040
I work for some very powerful people.

28:32.110 --> 28:37.514
My benefactors may be able to help sway
the committee's decision tomorrow.

28:37.582 --> 28:40.244
I see.

28:40.318 --> 28:44.015
And I suppose that these benefactors
of yours want something

28:44.089 --> 28:46.489
in return for their help.

28:47.859 --> 28:49.986
They would at that.

28:52.430 --> 28:54.022
Ah.

28:54.632 --> 28:58.466
We need to tap into the fiber optics.
The garage has a maintenance station.

28:58.536 --> 29:01.369
Guard checkpoints here and here.
The garage is locked down.

29:01.439 --> 29:04.738
- I can get into the parking garage.
- Hey, guys. Check this out.

29:04.809 --> 29:07.539
Winner - seven! Every time.

29:07.612 --> 29:09.705
- Seven!
- You're not supposed to hit seven.

29:09.781 --> 29:11.908
No, it's supposed to hit seven, right?

29:11.983 --> 29:13.883
I mean... See? Winner - seven.

29:13.952 --> 29:16.785
- You've got it backwards. She's right.
- Really?

29:18.523 --> 29:20.081
Talk to me about this vault.

29:20.158 --> 29:22.558
The deposit boxes are
in electromagnetic tumblers.

29:22.627 --> 29:23.616
Can we get around it?

29:23.695 --> 29:26.630
The mainframe resets
the pass codes daily.

29:26.698 --> 29:28.791
I can get around it.

29:28.867 --> 29:32.598
If it's an EM system,
I can decrypt the algorithm.

29:32.670 --> 29:34.729
I just need access to the network.

29:34.806 --> 29:37.400
Can we do it from a remote location?

29:38.710 --> 29:42.806
It's a segregated network.
I'd have to be there.

29:42.881 --> 29:44.610
But... I'll go.

29:46.718 --> 29:48.413
- I'll do it.
- It's OK.

29:48.486 --> 29:50.613
No, I mean, I want to.

29:54.459 --> 30:00.625
I had to dig through my friends yesterday
because of Gordon Dean.

30:00.698 --> 30:05.328
If I can help you stop him,
then that's what I need to do.

30:06.971 --> 30:10.031
There's not a whole lot that'll scare me.

30:11.009 --> 30:13.068
Not anymore.

30:33.031 --> 30:37.024
Tell your pit boss we need more money.
We're feeling lucky tonight.

30:55.854 --> 30:59.153
Madame, could we please
have a word with you?

31:10.902 --> 31:12.529
I need a piece of paper.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.701
Here. How's this?

31:22.113 --> 31:25.514
Sidewinder, I'm approaching the vault.
What's your status?

31:25.583 --> 31:27.414
- They're ready for us.
- Sidewinder?

31:27.485 --> 31:28.884
We gotta go.

31:28.953 --> 31:31.513
Do you wanna do
the advanced binomial calculus?

31:31.589 --> 31:35.787
Because I'd be more than happy
to stand there and watch.

31:35.860 --> 31:38.090
Sidewinder's gonna need a little more time.

31:41.132 --> 31:44.101
- I'm at the vault. I need that key code.
- Got it.

31:48.640 --> 31:49.664
I've got the package.

32:11.362 --> 32:14.058
- We have the archive.
- (Jack) What's your location?

32:14.132 --> 32:18.728
- I'm approaching the ferry now.
- Copy that. Have a safe trip.

32:41.092 --> 32:42.821
(phone rings)

32:43.394 --> 32:48.161
I don't know what Mockingbird is!
Please, what is Mockingbird?

32:54.706 --> 32:58.164
I can't help you
if you don't tell me what you want.

33:00.845 --> 33:04.906
Ms. Bristow, you're not exactly
in the position to play coy.

33:06.284 --> 33:07.410
You know who I am.

33:08.853 --> 33:11.788
- Yes.
- You know what I want.

33:12.623 --> 33:16.059
You're not thinking, Dean.
If you drop me, you destroy your archive.

33:16.127 --> 33:20.223
The laptop's a fake. There's nothing on it.

33:20.298 --> 33:23.529
Where's Mockingbird now? Ms. Bristow...

33:23.601 --> 33:25.466
All right, all right,youwin.

33:25.536 --> 33:29.165
Listen... the ClA has her
in protective custody.

33:29.240 --> 33:30.867
She's... in a safe...

33:30.942 --> 33:33.069
(ship's horn blows)

33:33.144 --> 33:34.509
What?

33:34.579 --> 33:37.013
She's in a safe house in Philadelphia.

33:37.081 --> 33:42.212
Listen carefully. Tell your people to deliver
her to the 30th Street train station.

33:42.286 --> 33:44.652
They have exactly 30 minutes.

33:45.490 --> 33:47.151
Sydney.

33:48.226 --> 33:50.160
What's happening?

33:50.228 --> 33:52.321
Rachel, hang on a sec.

33:55.967 --> 33:57.229
I gotta call my dad.

33:58.236 --> 34:00.329
- Dean doesn't know Rachel's with you?
- No.

34:00.405 --> 34:04.967
He's expecting the ClA to deliver her
in exactly... 26 minutes.

34:05.043 --> 34:07.011
Task the satellites
for full coverage of her area.

34:07.078 --> 34:11.174
If Dean calls again, route it through us.
Don't worry, we'll get you down.

34:11.849 --> 34:14.373
You'd better.

34:14.886 --> 34:18.549
Dixon, where are you?
We're en route. Five minutes away.

34:18.623 --> 34:22.252
Approach that crane carefully.
We don't know who's on the ground.

34:22.326 --> 34:25.420
- Rules of engagement at your discretion.
- Copy. Almost there.

34:32.637 --> 34:34.797
Rachel, how you doing?

34:34.871 --> 34:38.034
I've been better. How are you?

34:38.109 --> 34:41.442
Oh, you know.
Just another day at the office.

34:43.181 --> 34:47.675
Hey, Rachel, look around back there.
Is there anything that might be useful?

34:47.752 --> 34:50.516
Well, there's a tire.

34:52.290 --> 34:54.281
And... acrowbar.

34:54.358 --> 34:57.987
And I have my purse. Are those helpful?

34:58.062 --> 35:00.360
No, not really.

35:02.900 --> 35:04.765
Uh...

35:04.836 --> 35:07.236
How high up are we?

35:07.305 --> 35:09.034
Oh, just...

35:10.675 --> 35:13.166
couple hundred feet.

35:13.244 --> 35:17.613
Don't worry, I've been
in much worse situations than this.

35:17.682 --> 35:19.240
You have?

35:20.218 --> 35:23.745
Area's clear so far.
We're approaching the cab now.

35:28.292 --> 35:31.227
- It's empty.
- Can you get to the controls?

35:34.031 --> 35:35.965
Hang on.

35:36.033 --> 35:38.126
It's got some sort of...

35:39.971 --> 35:41.666
Uh-oh.

35:43.274 --> 35:45.572
That was fast. Do it.

35:48.379 --> 35:50.006
(yelling)

35:50.081 --> 35:51.070
Sydney...

36:07.265 --> 36:09.995
Pull your agents off site. Right now.

36:10.067 --> 36:12.535
Outrigger, get out of there!

36:13.437 --> 36:17.965
You're trying my patience.
Any further deviations, and I will drop you.

36:18.042 --> 36:21.273
I want confirmation
that Mockingbird's en route.

36:21.345 --> 36:22.642
What sort of confirmation?

36:22.713 --> 36:24.840
- Have her call me.
- (whispering) What?

36:24.916 --> 36:27.180
Dean's got the place wired.
It's all on remote.

36:27.251 --> 36:31.881
If I can isolate the frequency, I might be
able to override the crane's controls.

36:31.956 --> 36:34.288
- What do you need from us?
- Just time.

36:34.358 --> 36:36.519
Sydney.

36:36.594 --> 36:40.997
I can't do that.
I can't call him. He'll know.

36:41.065 --> 36:44.330
I'm a terrible liar.
That's why he wants me to call.

36:44.402 --> 36:47.235
Rachel, this is easy.
This is just like in Prague.

36:47.305 --> 36:50.274
You have to become someone else -
the person you used to be.

36:50.341 --> 36:52.935
All you have to do is
act helpless and scared.

36:53.010 --> 36:55.638
- I am scared.
- Yeah, but you're not helpless.

36:55.713 --> 36:57.704
Not anymore.

36:57.782 --> 37:02.219
Look... I've spent my life dealing
with men like Gordon Dean.

37:02.286 --> 37:05.653
They all have a fatal flaw.
They always want power.

37:05.723 --> 37:11.127
So you fool 'em into thinking they have it.
And you hit 'em when they're not looking.

37:11.195 --> 37:14.926
- So, what do I do?
- Act terrified. Keep him on the phone.

37:14.999 --> 37:16.330
We'll do the rest.

37:22.773 --> 37:24.764
(phone rings)

37:27.245 --> 37:28.177
Hello.

37:28.246 --> 37:33.445
- They told me to call you.
- Rachel. Where are you?

37:33.517 --> 37:35.815
I'm in a van. I don't know.

37:35.886 --> 37:40.255
They wanted me to tell you
that they're doing everything you asked.

37:40.324 --> 37:43.919
They're turning me over to you.
They won't tell me anything else.

37:43.995 --> 37:46.293
OK...

37:46.364 --> 37:50.596
- What are you gonna do to me?
- Just come in. We need to talk to you.

37:50.668 --> 37:54.399
I didn't tell them anything.
I swear, I didn't tell them anything.

37:54.472 --> 37:55.734
I believe you.

37:55.806 --> 37:59.207
- Marshall?
- I'm almost there. Just give me a sec.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.245
Give me a sec. Almost there.

38:01.312 --> 38:05.681
- What are you gonna do to me?
- Depends on how cooperative you are.

38:05.750 --> 38:08.218
I'll do anything you want.
Please. Mr. Dean.

38:08.286 --> 38:11.483
Please. I don't wanna die.

38:11.555 --> 38:13.420
(ship's horn blows)

38:13.491 --> 38:15.425
Rachel. plan B!

38:15.493 --> 38:16.653
What was that?

38:16.727 --> 38:18.991
Kick the backseat as hard as you can.

38:19.063 --> 38:21.293
Now! Do it right now!

38:21.365 --> 38:22.662
The crowbar!

38:23.801 --> 38:24.825
She's in the car.

38:27.138 --> 38:28.730
Give me your hand.

38:28.806 --> 38:30.000
Drop 'em!

38:34.045 --> 38:35.410
(screams)

38:53.030 --> 38:56.625
Mr. Sloane, this committee
has reviewed your case

38:56.701 --> 39:00.034
and is prepared to render its ruling.

39:00.838 --> 39:05.434
Before we do so,
I'd like to reiterate for the record

39:05.509 --> 39:08.239
my extreme disapproval
for tactics you have employed

39:08.312 --> 39:11.679
while working under the auspices
of the United States Government.

39:11.749 --> 39:15.116
Your compromised methodology
sullies the name of every man and woman

39:15.186 --> 39:18.178
who serves this country honorably.

39:19.890 --> 39:24.827
However, while I may detest your methods,

39:24.895 --> 39:27.625
I cannot deny your results.

39:28.632 --> 39:31.260
Aftercareful examination ofthefacts,

39:31.335 --> 39:35.396
this committee is forced to conclude
your recent actions fall

39:35.473 --> 39:40.740
within the guidelines of your pardon
agreement, and that, in truth,

39:40.811 --> 39:44.508
you have this country's best interests
in mind.

39:44.582 --> 39:47.881
I find no cause for violation.

39:47.952 --> 39:53.151
Arvin Sloane, I hereby order your release,
effective immediately.

40:31.162 --> 40:35.155
How can you people sleep
after something like this?

40:37.535 --> 40:41.471
You just learn to take it
where you can get it, I guess.

40:44.208 --> 40:48.941
It's never gonna be over, is it?
I'm gonna be with you a while.

40:55.052 --> 40:57.987
In custody, I mean.

40:59.123 --> 41:02.889
You'll be with us
until it's safe for you to go home.

41:04.094 --> 41:05.925
When will that be?

41:07.965 --> 41:10.456
I honestly don't know.

41:11.902 --> 41:14.803
Dean knows how dangerous you are
to him.

41:14.872 --> 41:18.467
We can't release you
until we've brought him in.

41:19.677 --> 41:21.838
But it doesn't end with Dean.

41:22.913 --> 41:24.642
No, it doesn't.

41:25.649 --> 41:28.550
It's never gonna be safe.

41:29.854 --> 41:32.448
I guess we'll have to bring 'em all down.

41:35.125 --> 41:37.650
Every single one of 'em.

42:41.792 --> 42:43.282
(children) Bad robot!
