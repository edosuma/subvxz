You know, today's the last day
of our special week

01:06.210 --> 01:08.820
on location at fabulous
Mount Splashmore.

01:08.880 --> 01:13.190
I just want to say
the people here have been super

01:13.250 --> 01:15.020
to me and Sideshow Mel.

01:15.090 --> 01:16.560
The food, the grog...

01:16.620 --> 01:19.890
Oh, they threw us a brunch
yesterday with fresh fruit

01:19.960 --> 01:21.330
and the most delicious melon.

01:21.390 --> 01:22.920
We ate till we plotzed.

is those special, special
Mount Splashmore water slides.

So much fun, so many memories.

01:31.440 --> 01:32.610
Excuse me a minute.

hasn't it Lise?

01:35.870 --> 01:39.100
I hope all you kids come out
this weekend and really pack
this place

01:39.180 --> 01:41.380

how grateful I am.

01:41.450 --> 01:42.880

02:04.200 --> 02:06.200
This is a rather
shameless promotion.

Me too.

02:36.170 --> 02:37.270
Yeah.
Of course.

Well? Will you take us
to Mount Splashmore?

What?!

04:33.750 --> 04:35.850
Come on, you stupid tube.

04:35.920 --> 04:39.430
Hmm, looks like there's
a jam in Delta Sector.

04:39.490 --> 04:40.400
It's too big
to be human.

04:40.460 --> 04:41.900
Send down a few kids.

04:41.960 --> 04:43.160
That should dislodge it.

05:04.450 --> 05:06.290
Eyewitnesses estimate
the man's weight

05:06.350 --> 05:08.890
at somewhere between
400 and 500 pounds.

05:08.950 --> 05:10.780
...And now on the lighter side
of the news

05:10.860 --> 05:12.660
and I use the term loosely...

05:12.720 --> 05:13.520
D-ohhh!

05:13.590 --> 05:16.330
No, the slide is perfectly safe.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.100
It was an isolated incident.

05:18.160 --> 05:20.530
I understand that Krusty, but
isn't that exactly what you said

05:20.600 --> 05:23.770
right before the recall of
tainted Krusty brand mayonnaise?

05:23.840 --> 05:25.040
Now, Kent

05:25.100 --> 05:27.130
you know that question
is out of bounds.

05:27.210 --> 05:28.840
This interview's over.

05:28.910 --> 05:31.810
All right, family.
I want the truth.

05:31.880 --> 05:33.550
Don't pull any punches.

05:33.610 --> 05:36.650
Am I just a little bit
overweight?

05:38.750 --> 05:40.620
Well, am I?

05:40.690 --> 05:43.760
Forgive us Dad, but it takes
time to properly sugarcoat
a response.

05:43.820 --> 05:44.980
Ohhh!

05:52.130 --> 05:53.730
Oh, 437..!

05:53.800 --> 05:54.740
What?

05:54.800 --> 05:55.570
Fifty-five..?

05:55.630 --> 05:56.660
Oh, my God!

05:56.740 --> 05:57.640
Three hundred and...

05:57.700 --> 05:59.430
What's this-- 150?

05:59.500 --> 06:01.100
Ah! Oh. Ah! Oh.

06:01.170 --> 06:02.270
Oh, my God!

06:02.340 --> 06:04.410
It's 260 pounds!

06:04.480 --> 06:07.350
I'm a big fat pig!

06:07.410 --> 06:10.810
Now, Homer, you
do have big bones.

06:10.880 --> 06:14.250
Marge, no one gains
30 pounds of bone.

06:14.320 --> 06:16.290
I'm going on a diet.

06:16.360 --> 06:18.030
From this day forward

06:18.090 --> 06:21.300
I pledge there will be
no pork chop too succulent

06:21.360 --> 06:22.700
no doughnut too tasty

06:22.760 --> 06:25.630
no pizza too laden
with delicious topping

06:25.700 --> 06:27.700
to prevent me from reaching

06:27.770 --> 06:30.870
my scientifically determined
ideal weight.

06:30.940 --> 06:35.740
As God is my witness,
I'll always be hungry again!

06:35.810 --> 06:37.010
( <i>stomach gurgling )</i>

06:37.080 --> 06:38.310
D-oh, shut up!

06:42.060 --> 06:43.320
This old attic's
kind of spooky

06:43.400 --> 06:45.440
isn't it, boy?

06:45.500 --> 06:46.700
I said, isn't it, boy?

06:46.770 --> 06:48.470
Ahh!

06:48.540 --> 06:50.910
Don't ever do that
to me again.

06:50.970 --> 06:51.630
Okay.

06:51.710 --> 06:52.610
D-ohhh!

06:52.670 --> 06:54.770
Aagh!
Get away from that thing

06:54.840 --> 06:56.500
<i>and help me find
my athletic equipment.</i>

06:56.580 --> 06:57.720
( <i>mouse squeals )</i>

06:57.780 --> 07:00.380
Hey Homer, I found
your weights.

07:00.450 --> 07:01.650
Oh, the glutemus maximizer.

07:01.720 --> 07:02.790
<i>Hey!</i>

07:02.850 --> 07:04.560
Who's the mop top
with the big schnozz?

07:04.620 --> 07:07.890
Don't you know anything, boy?
That's Ringo Starr.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.460
What is this?

07:09.520 --> 07:12.450
Hey, your mother
must have painted this.

07:12.530 --> 07:15.470
I guess she thought
he was kinda cute.

07:15.530 --> 07:16.900
What..? Hey!

07:16.970 --> 07:18.200
What the..?

07:18.270 --> 07:19.770
Marge!

07:19.840 --> 07:23.040
No, Homer. Don't be jealous.
I was a schoolgirl.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.640
The Beatles were very popular
and I had a crush on them.

07:25.710 --> 07:26.910
Likely story.

07:26.980 --> 07:30.180
Why did I have
to start my diet

07:30.250 --> 07:31.980
on pork chop night?

07:32.050 --> 07:33.990
Now Homer,
we've got steamed vegetables

07:34.050 --> 07:35.950
and rice cakes
for you.

07:36.020 --> 07:37.690
Well, wait a minute.

07:37.750 --> 07:41.080
I've been setting my drinks
on these things.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.090
They're only 35 calories apiece.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.600
Hello? Hello?

07:46.660 --> 07:48.100
Hello, taste?

07:48.160 --> 07:49.790
Where are you?

07:49.870 --> 07:51.100
You can put a little
something on top

07:51.170 --> 07:52.100
for flavor.

07:52.170 --> 07:53.840
Now you're talking.

07:53.900 --> 07:56.230
Hey Mom,
these paintings
are good.

07:56.300 --> 07:57.770
While I know firsthand
how fragile

07:57.840 --> 07:59.410
<i>young talent is</i>

07:59.470 --> 08:02.270
I'd love to hear
the particulars of how
your gift was squashed.

08:02.340 --> 08:03.200
Well...

08:04.550 --> 08:06.350
No, not another portrait

08:06.420 --> 08:08.750
of that bongo-beating
Liverpudlian.

08:08.820 --> 08:09.920
But Mr. Schindler...

08:09.990 --> 08:12.360
Someone might have
used this canvas

08:12.420 --> 08:14.060
to create a masterpiece.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.180
Instead, you've soiled it
forever.

08:16.260 --> 08:18.230
Now, <i>this is art.</i>

08:18.290 --> 08:20.090
Thank you, Mr. Schindler.

08:20.160 --> 08:23.730
Lisa:
<i>Oh, Mom, I can't believe
you gave up painting</i>

08:23.800 --> 08:25.740
<i>because of one small-minded
art teacher.</i>

08:25.800 --> 08:27.470
Marge:
<i>I was so upset</i>

08:27.540 --> 08:29.770
<i>I decided to send
the portrait to the
only man on Earth</i>

08:29.840 --> 08:31.510
<i>whose opinion
I could really trust.</i>

08:31.570 --> 08:33.799
Lisa:
<i>And what was Ringo's response?</i>

08:33.880 --> 08:35.350
I never got any

08:35.409 --> 08:37.179
and I never painted again.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.580
Maybe you could
take a class

08:38.650 --> 08:39.820
at Springfield Community
College.

08:39.880 --> 08:42.220
I think it's
a very nice idea.

08:42.280 --> 08:42.980
Don't you, Homer?

08:43.049 --> 08:43.720
Do I have to do anything?

08:43.789 --> 08:44.420
No.

08:44.490 --> 08:46.390
Great! Fine! Go nuts!

08:46.460 --> 08:47.360
( <i>timer dings )</i>

08:47.420 --> 08:49.420
Mmm...

08:49.490 --> 08:50.530
only 35 calories.

08:55.060 --> 08:56.390
Hello, Mrs. Homer.

08:56.470 --> 08:59.000
Apu, what are you
doing here?

08:59.070 --> 09:00.740
I've just enrolled in the
screenwriting class.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.730
I yearn to tell the story
of an idealistic young Hindu

09:03.810 --> 09:06.780
pushed too far
by convenience store bandits.

09:06.840 --> 09:10.180
I call it
<i>Hands Off My Jerky, Turkey.</i>

09:10.250 --> 09:11.520
Clever title.

09:11.580 --> 09:13.620
Thank you. Actually my brother
Sanjay thought of it.

09:13.680 --> 09:14.550
Next up.

09:14.620 --> 09:16.090
My mother would like to enroll

09:16.150 --> 09:18.090
in "Painting From Life" 2-B,
please.

09:18.150 --> 09:20.380
Woah, woah, woah.
Not so fast there, pint-size.

09:20.460 --> 09:23.490
I'm afraid no one can enroll
until Professor Lombardo

09:23.560 --> 09:25.660
<i>personally inspects and
approves their portfolio.</i>

09:25.730 --> 09:27.970
Lisa, this was a bad idea.

09:28.030 --> 09:29.000
Mom!

09:29.060 --> 09:31.860
Ah... very good.

09:31.930 --> 09:33.390
Fabulous!

09:33.470 --> 09:35.040
Ah, even better.

09:35.100 --> 09:36.900
You have real talent.

09:36.970 --> 09:40.310
Do you really think so?
My high school art teacher
hated them.

09:40.380 --> 09:41.810
What?! The man was a fool.

09:41.880 --> 09:43.550
But still, one must admire

09:43.610 --> 09:45.350
the force
of his conviction.

09:45.410 --> 09:46.370
Then I'm in the class?

09:46.450 --> 09:47.790
Oh, my dear

09:47.850 --> 09:50.220
there couldn't be a class
without you.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.220
Now if you'll excuse me,

09:53.290 --> 09:54.490
Marvelous!

unless you move, Homer.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.390
I can't move, boy.

Oh, really.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.110
( <i>grunting: )
Whoa!</i>

10:08.170 --> 10:10.470
Now, using the Lombardo method

10:10.540 --> 10:13.710
you learn to see
everyday objects

10:13.780 --> 10:16.350
as a simple grouping
of geometrical shapes.

10:16.410 --> 10:19.620
Here, we see
how two concentric circles

various trapezoids, ellipsis--

10:21.820 --> 10:24.120
and yes, even a rhombus!--

10:24.190 --> 10:27.120
can create an adorable

Well, you're welcome,

Marge, walk with me.

11:15.440 --> 11:16.910
Marge, they've asked <i>me</i>

11:19.670 --> 11:22.570

11:22.640 --> 11:26.670
I've decided to choose
your <i>Bald Adonis.</i>

You're so supportive.

Hmm...

11:49.440 --> 11:50.610
Yeah.

11:50.670 --> 11:52.380
I can't believe it!

11:52.440 --> 11:53.380
Go Mom!

11:53.440 --> 11:54.650
Whoo-hoo!

12:03.990 --> 12:05.460
did you flunk out of?

12:05.520 --> 12:07.460
You ham-fisted

12:07.520 --> 12:09.980
Smithers, throw this
on the dung heap.

12:10.060 --> 12:11.660
I'm sorry.
This isn't working out. I quit.

12:11.730 --> 12:14.970
I guess that's what you call
your artistic temperament.

12:15.030 --> 12:17.330
Sir, I must remind you
that the dedication
of the Burns Wing

12:17.400 --> 12:19.340
of the museum is only

12:19.400 --> 12:20.500
six days away.

12:20.570 --> 12:22.470
Damnation, Smithers.
This idea of yours to

12:22.540 --> 12:24.140
immortalize me in a portrait
was as half-baked

12:24.210 --> 12:27.110
as your idea about
me having children.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.850
Find me an artist.

12:28.910 --> 12:31.920
Sir, I'm afraid you've
systematically alienated

12:31.980 --> 12:33.280
Springfield's
art community.

12:33.350 --> 12:34.950
The only one left is this

12:35.020 --> 12:36.120
Mrs. Homer Simpson.

12:36.180 --> 12:37.440
Who?

12:37.520 --> 12:39.720
She won first prize
in the Springfield Art Fair

12:39.790 --> 12:40.790
and is the wife
of an employee.

12:40.860 --> 12:41.430
She'll be easily
intimidated.

12:41.490 --> 12:42.960
Excellent.

12:43.020 --> 12:45.450
Once again,
the wheel has turned

12:45.530 --> 12:48.770

has hugged Montgomery Burns

13:15.990 --> 13:17.360
Look at me.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.530
My clothes are just
hanging off me.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.320
That's wonderful,
isn't it, kids?

13:21.400 --> 13:22.730
Pass the moo juice.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.470
Remember what I said
about showing a little support?

13:24.530 --> 13:25.930
Way to go, Dad!

13:26.000 --> 13:27.370
You look marvelous.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.170
Oh, what a family.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.540
Hey, what gives?

13:30.610 --> 13:32.480
These doughnuts
are piling up.

13:32.540 --> 13:34.950
Homer Simpson went on a diet.

13:35.010 --> 13:38.350
Oh, my God,
and I just bought a boat.

13:46.050 --> 13:48.820
Well, don't people answer
the door these days?

13:48.890 --> 13:50.160
Allow me, sir.

13:50.230 --> 13:53.030
Open up! Open up!

13:53.090 --> 13:55.120
Mr. Burns.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.370
Oh... would you like
to come in?

13:57.430 --> 14:00.040
Mr. Burns would like to
commission you to do a
portrait of him.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.840
Have you ever painted
the rich and powerful?

14:01.900 --> 14:04.100
Well, no. Just Ringo Starr.

14:04.170 --> 14:05.510
Ringo?

14:05.570 --> 14:07.870
He was the drummer
for a rock and roll combo

14:07.940 --> 14:08.900
called The Beatles.

14:08.980 --> 14:10.380
Beatles, eh?
Oh, yes.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.720
<i>I seem to remember</i>

14:11.780 --> 14:14.620
their off-key caterwauling
on the ol' Sullivan show.

14:14.680 --> 14:15.940
What was Ed thinking?

14:16.020 --> 14:17.720
Mrs. Simpson,
this commission

14:17.790 --> 14:20.790
and all of its glory
can be yours

14:20.860 --> 14:23.830
but first you must look me
straight in the eye and answer
one, simple question.

14:23.890 --> 14:25.130
Okay, shoot.

14:25.190 --> 14:26.920
Can you make me beautiful?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.200
I don't think
that will be a problem.

14:29.260 --> 14:31.160
I'm no matinee idol,
you know.

14:31.230 --> 14:32.830
Well, maybe not

14:32.900 --> 14:36.140
but I have the gift of being
able to see <i>inner beauty.</i>

14:36.200 --> 14:39.070
Mrs. Simpson,
you may immortalize me.

14:39.140 --> 14:43.950
Ah, sir, at last the world
will see you as I always have.

14:44.010 --> 14:45.280
Yes, yes, yes.

14:45.350 --> 14:47.650
Don't be stingy
with the blush, Smithers.

14:50.250 --> 14:51.990
Now, you-- paint.

14:54.220 --> 14:55.960
Honey, I'm home.

There's an original sentiment.

14:58.560 --> 15:00.200
Take it outside, Simpson.

15:00.260 --> 15:01.500
I'm male modeling.

15:01.560 --> 15:03.560
I'm painting
his portrait, Homer.

15:03.630 --> 15:05.600
( <i>laughing: )
Isn't that wonderful?</i>

15:05.670 --> 15:08.540
My work and my home life
come together

15:08.600 --> 15:10.260
in such a nice way.

15:10.340 --> 15:11.940
May I see you
in the other room?

15:12.010 --> 15:14.010
Honey, he's nuts.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.380
He thinks he's handsome.
Please, you've got to make
him look handsome.

15:15.440 --> 15:17.070
Please, please, please, please.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.420
Homer, don't worry.

15:18.480 --> 15:21.590
All I need to do is find
Mr. Burns' inner beauty.

15:21.650 --> 15:24.290
Ohh! Okay.

15:24.350 --> 15:28.650
What were you like as a boy,
Mr. Burns?

15:28.720 --> 15:30.280
Did you have a dog
that you loved?

15:30.360 --> 15:31.330
Well... dahh!

15:31.390 --> 15:33.150
There's something on my leg.

15:33.230 --> 15:34.670
Get it off!

15:34.730 --> 15:37.330
Mr. Burns,
she's just a baby.
Ugh!..

15:39.370 --> 15:40.970
All right, all right.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.310
Who took the funny pages?

15:43.370 --> 15:45.710
So Ziggy goes to the repair shop

15:45.770 --> 15:47.630
and there's a sign
on the doorbell reading

15:47.710 --> 15:49.950
"Out of order."

15:50.010 --> 15:52.780
Ah, Ziggy, will you ever win?

15:54.520 --> 15:55.990
( <i>humming )</i>

15:56.050 --> 15:57.320
Oh, my.

15:57.390 --> 15:58.560
If you'll excuse me

15:58.620 --> 16:00.520
I'm changing
for a board meeting.

16:00.590 --> 16:02.930
I'm so sorry, Mr. Burns.

16:02.990 --> 16:05.860
Hey Mom, did he have those spots
all over his body?

16:05.930 --> 16:07.260
- I heard that.
- Oops.

16:07.330 --> 16:09.700
Would you feel more comfortable
if I left too, Sir?

16:09.760 --> 16:11.190
Of course not.

16:11.270 --> 16:13.900
You're like a doctor.

16:13.970 --> 16:16.810
Burns:
<i>Smithers, I want my tea!</i>

16:16.870 --> 16:17.940
Doesn't it bother you

16:18.010 --> 16:20.210
that he orders you around
like that?

16:20.280 --> 16:22.780
Actually I value every second
we're together

16:22.840 --> 16:26.740
from the moment I squeeze his
orange juice in the morning
till I tuck him in at night.

16:26.810 --> 16:28.010
He's not just my boss.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.680
He's my best friend, too.

16:29.750 --> 16:30.650
Bah!

16:30.720 --> 16:31.660
Too hot!

16:31.720 --> 16:32.960
You're right, sir.

16:33.020 --> 16:34.060
It's scalding me
as we speak.

16:34.120 --> 16:35.460
( <i>gasps )</i>

16:38.490 --> 16:39.820
Dear Sally.

16:39.890 --> 16:43.090
In response to your letter
of December 12, 1966

16:43.160 --> 16:45.160
me favorite color is blue

16:45.230 --> 16:47.800
and me real first name
is Richard.

16:47.870 --> 16:49.470
Thanks for the snapshot.

16:49.540 --> 16:50.840
You're a real cute bird.

16:50.910 --> 16:52.240
Love, Ringo.

16:52.310 --> 16:54.280
P.S. Forgive the lateness
of my reply.

16:54.340 --> 16:55.680
Mr. Starr,
tea and crumpets.

16:55.740 --> 16:57.200
Just set it over there.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.920
Sir, if you'll forgive an old
Brit his impertinence,

16:59.980 --> 17:02.450
your devotion to your fans
is nothing short of remarkable.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.960
Well Weatherby, they took
the time to write me

17:05.020 --> 17:07.859
and I don't care
if it takes me another 20 years.

17:07.920 --> 17:09.520
I'm going to answer

17:09.589 --> 17:11.230
every one of them.

17:11.290 --> 17:13.619
Hello. What's this?

17:13.700 --> 17:15.569
From Springfield, U.S.A.

17:17.099 --> 17:18.240

17:23.270 --> 17:25.940
Will you cease
that infernal tootling?

17:26.010 --> 17:27.950
I was just practicing.

17:28.010 --> 17:30.550
It's hard to discover
your inner beauty

17:30.610 --> 17:32.950
while you're shouting
at an 8 year-old girl.

17:33.010 --> 17:35.440
We've got two days left,
so I'd advise you to
shut up and paint!

17:35.520 --> 17:36.990
( groans )

17:37.050 --> 17:39.260
Alright scale,
you don't like me
and I don't like you

17:39.320 --> 17:40.990
but I've been very good

17:41.060 --> 17:42.590
so you'd better
treat me right.

17:42.660 --> 17:44.030
All right!

17:44.090 --> 17:45.160
Whoa-ho-ho!

17:45.230 --> 17:47.060
Whoo! Whoo!

17:47.130 --> 17:51.200
Marge, I'm 239
and I'm feeling fine.

17:51.270 --> 17:54.100
Look, I'm using the
original notches that came
with my belt.

17:54.170 --> 17:56.640
That's wonderful, Homer.
I'm so proud of--

17:56.700 --> 17:58.400
Let me get
this straight.

17:58.470 --> 18:01.500
You're <i>pleased
with your current appearance?</i>

18:01.580 --> 18:04.380
Why, my good man

18:04.450 --> 18:06.180
<i>you're the fattest thing
I've ever seen</i>

18:06.250 --> 18:08.190
and I've been on safari.

18:08.250 --> 18:11.190
If you need me, I'll be
in the refrigerator.

18:11.250 --> 18:13.380

18:13.450 --> 18:14.780
Mr. Burns

18:14.860 --> 18:16.990
I've had enough
of your... posing.

18:17.060 --> 18:19.430
I can finish
the portrait myself.

18:19.490 --> 18:21.990
Thank goodness.
Another day in this
suburban nightmare

18:22.060 --> 18:24.090
and I would have needed
half a white Valium.

18:24.170 --> 18:25.140
Thank you for your
gracious hospitality.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.300
See you at the unveiling.

18:27.370 --> 18:28.740
( <i>whistling )</i>

18:30.440 --> 18:32.480
Homer, what are you doing?

18:32.540 --> 18:34.010
Give me that.

18:34.080 --> 18:35.150
No, Burns is right.

18:35.210 --> 18:36.280
What's the use?

18:36.340 --> 18:37.640
Don't you listen to him.

18:37.710 --> 18:39.850
He's just a mean, little S.O.B.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.110
Oh, Marge.

18:41.180 --> 18:42.710
I thought there was
good in everybody

18:42.780 --> 18:44.580
until I met him.

18:44.650 --> 18:47.350
Yeah, well just as long as
you paint a nice picture
of him by noon tomorrow..

18:47.420 --> 18:48.160
I don't think I can.

18:48.220 --> 18:48.950
What?!

18:49.020 --> 18:49.950
You have to.

18:50.020 --> 18:51.750
I can't make that man
beautiful.

18:51.830 --> 18:53.760
I'm just not good enough.

18:53.830 --> 18:55.800
I guess I'm no artist.

18:55.860 --> 18:57.790
Hello. What's this?

18:57.870 --> 19:00.900
It's for you, Marge,
from merry old England.

19:00.970 --> 19:02.940
"From the desk
of Ringo Starr."

19:03.000 --> 19:04.530
Ringo:
<i>"Dear Marge.</i>

19:04.610 --> 19:06.980
<i>"Thanks for the fab painting
of yours truly.</i>

19:07.040 --> 19:08.610
<i>"I hung it on me wall.</i>

19:08.680 --> 19:10.280
<i>"You're quite an artist.</i>

19:10.340 --> 19:12.370
<i>"In answer to your question</i>

19:12.450 --> 19:15.650
<i>"Yes, we do have hamburgers
and fries in England</i>

19:15.720 --> 19:17.550
<i>"but we call french fries
'chips.'</i>

19:17.620 --> 19:18.990
<i>"Love, Ringo.</i>

19:19.050 --> 19:22.820
<i>P.S. Forgive the lateness
of my reply."</i>

19:22.890 --> 19:24.530
Come on, Marge, paint.

19:24.590 --> 19:26.620
I think you can do it.

19:26.690 --> 19:30.390
Okay, Homer,
if you think I can.

19:30.470 --> 19:33.600
Ringo:
♪ Got to pay your dues
if you want to sing the blues ♪

19:33.670 --> 19:36.210
♪ And you know
it don't come easy ♪

19:38.410 --> 19:41.410
♪ You don't have to shout
or leap about ♪

19:41.480 --> 19:44.720
♪ You can even play them easy. ♪

19:55.260 --> 19:57.190
( <i>playing "For He's
a Jolly Good Fellow" )</i>

19:57.260 --> 19:59.460
Friends, art lovers,
security personnel

19:59.530 --> 20:01.570
today is a red letter day

20:01.630 --> 20:04.170
for the Springfield Palace
of Fine Arts.

20:04.230 --> 20:07.240
The new wing for our museum...
ooh, and a portrait

20:07.300 --> 20:10.210
commemorating the man
who ponied up the due.

20:10.270 --> 20:12.580
Ladies and gentlemen

20:12.640 --> 20:17.110
may I invite you to behold
Montgomery Burns.

20:20.310 --> 20:21.510
Smithers.

20:24.750 --> 20:25.350
( <i>gasps )</i>

20:26.450 --> 20:27.380
Oh.

20:27.460 --> 20:28.530
D-ohhh!

20:28.590 --> 20:30.030
I don't care for this at all.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.770
Um... hello.

20:36.830 --> 20:41.070
My name is Marge Simpson
and I painted this.

20:41.140 --> 20:42.710
Maybe you'd like to know

20:42.770 --> 20:44.040
what possessed me
to do it.

20:44.110 --> 20:47.280
Well, I guess I wanted to show

20:47.340 --> 20:50.810
that beneath Mr. Burns'
fearsome head

20:50.880 --> 20:53.350
with its cruel lips,
spiteful tongue

20:53.410 --> 20:55.210
and evil brain

20:55.280 --> 20:57.640
there was a frail,
withered body

20:57.720 --> 21:00.460
perhaps not long
for this world

21:00.520 --> 21:05.630
as vulnerable and beautiful
as any of God's creatures.

21:05.690 --> 21:07.250
( <i>crowd applauding )
Hmm?</i>

21:07.330 --> 21:08.870
Man:
Yes!

21:10.100 --> 21:12.100
Provocative but... powerful.

21:12.170 --> 21:14.070
He's bad, but he'll die.

21:14.140 --> 21:15.770
So I like it.

21:15.840 --> 21:17.170
Hmm...

21:17.240 --> 21:19.540
Marge, a word, please.

21:19.610 --> 21:22.250
You know,
I'm no art critic

21:22.310 --> 21:26.580
but I know what I hate,
and I don't hate this.

21:26.650 --> 21:30.320
Your painting is bold
but beautiful

21:30.380 --> 21:31.910
and, incidentally

21:31.990 --> 21:35.390
thanks for not making fun
of my genitalia.

21:35.460 --> 21:37.390
I thought I did.
