WEBVTT

00:02.600 --> 00:04.333
* Shoo-op, shoo-op

00:04.367 --> 00:07.067
* Ooh-aah-ooh

00:07.100 --> 00:09.033
-Did you swallow it?
-Yeah, I swallowed it.

00:09.067 --> 00:10.533
-Josh!
-It's in you.

00:10.567 --> 00:13.733
-It's in my tummy.
-I'm sick of you just
swallowing things all the time.

00:13.767 --> 00:16.467
-Yeah, now it's in,
you're just like pressuring
us like a time bomb.

00:16.500 --> 00:18.400
-No, don't put this on me,
okay? You do what you like.

00:18.433 --> 00:19.867
-I like meths.
-Not meths!

00:19.900 --> 00:24.033
-It's all making our own
individual choices
about recreational drugs.

00:24.067 --> 00:25.833
-Of course
we have to do it now,
what else would we do?

00:25.867 --> 00:27.633
-Yeah, just sit around
watching you be high?

00:27.667 --> 00:29.033
-You'll embarrass yourself.

00:29.067 --> 00:30.367
-I will not embarrass myself.

00:30.400 --> 00:33.700
-You will. You will.
You'll be there writhing
around in ecstasy,

00:33.733 --> 00:35.367
making out with
the sofa cushions.

00:38.333 --> 00:39.900
-Now you've both done it.

00:39.933 --> 00:42.800
-I'm a bit worried that
you think making out with
sofa cushions is a big part

00:42.833 --> 00:45.033
of what's about
to happen.

00:45.067 --> 00:46.300
-Just do it, Arnold. Go.

00:46.333 --> 00:48.800
-If you want.
-(scoffs)

00:48.833 --> 00:50.767
-Will you guys think
I'm not cool,
if I don't do it?

00:50.800 --> 00:53.367
-I don't think there's
any chance of anyone
in this room

00:53.400 --> 00:55.133
being cooler than
any one else in this room.

00:55.167 --> 00:57.033
-Whatever. You know
you're the coolest
one in the group.

00:57.067 --> 00:58.300
-What? No, I'm not.

00:58.333 --> 00:59.600
-No, I don't
actually think that.

00:59.633 --> 01:01.400
I just wanted to see
if you'd agree if
I said it out loud.

01:01.433 --> 01:03.733
-Okay, I can do this.
We're young. We're hot.

01:03.767 --> 01:05.100
-You think we're hot?

01:05.133 --> 01:07.100
-You've got your whole life
ahead of you to get back
on track.

01:07.133 --> 01:09.267
-I don't know what my regrets
will be when I'm 93.

01:09.300 --> 01:11.400
It could be taking this pill,
it could be not
taking this pill.

01:11.433 --> 01:12.367
-Josh-- it will be Josh.

01:12.400 --> 01:15.167
-I'm not losing control.
I'm taking control.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.033
Taking control of being
a real fun, party guy.

01:19.100 --> 01:21.333
-Yeah!
-It's stuck.

01:21.367 --> 01:23.500
-Gosh, get him something.
-How can it be stuck?

01:23.533 --> 01:25.567
-I was just taking pills.
-Water. Drink the water.

01:28.233 --> 01:30.200
-That's not water.

01:30.233 --> 01:31.800
-Not water.
-Oh, yeah. That's old Riesling.

01:31.833 --> 01:34.300
I'm sorry.
-(Arnold coughs)

01:34.333 --> 01:35.667
-Is it down?
-It's down.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.100
How long till
it kicks in?

01:42.133 --> 01:43.533
-30 minutes at least.
-30 minutes?

01:43.567 --> 01:47.800
-Or-- Or-- Or, because
you have the build of
a sparrow, maybe faster.

01:47.833 --> 01:50.433
-Yeah.
-(breathing heavily)

01:50.467 --> 01:52.767
-You all right, buddy?
-Oh, no! Can't touch him
while he's freaking out.

01:52.800 --> 01:55.433
-Can't touch him when
he's relaxed. Can't touch
him when he's freaking out.

01:55.467 --> 01:57.300
-When can I touch him?
-I'm fine.

01:59.667 --> 02:01.533
-What do we do now?

02:01.567 --> 02:03.533
-I think we just wait.

02:03.567 --> 02:04.933
-(cuckoo clock chiming)

02:04.967 --> 02:07.400
-So the main risk with MDMA,
apart from being sold
something dodge,

02:07.433 --> 02:08.933
is that it can
dehydrate you.

02:08.967 --> 02:12.233
-I thought the main risk
was that it would just
make me too good at dancing.

02:12.267 --> 02:13.467
Okay, fine,
we'll drink some water.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.767
-It's not that easy.
-Why?

02:15.800 --> 02:19.600
-People sometimes drown because
they know they have to drink
water and they drink too much.

02:19.633 --> 02:21.233
-They drown?
-Yeah.

02:21.267 --> 02:23.767
They drown!

02:23.800 --> 02:26.533
-Okay, then we'll take a little
bottle and we can
track our intake.

02:26.567 --> 02:29.233
-What if it gives me
an erection?

02:29.267 --> 02:30.700
-It won't.

02:30.733 --> 02:32.767
-Not really our problem, is it?

02:32.800 --> 02:34.200
-You got your little quote?

02:34.233 --> 02:38.133
-Ship in the harbor
is safe, that's not
what ships are built for.

02:38.167 --> 02:39.433
(panting)

02:40.533 --> 02:41.533
(coughing)

02:41.567 --> 02:43.467
-Oh, God, Arnold.
Um, hey.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.333
They're nice shoes.
-Thanks--

02:45.367 --> 02:47.300
-Thank you.
-Where did you get them?

02:48.333 --> 02:51.067
-A store.
-What store?

02:51.100 --> 02:53.133
-My mum bought them.
-What color are they?

02:53.167 --> 02:54.767
-They're brown.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.733
-I'm trying to make him
conscious of his reality,
so he steps out of his panic.

02:57.767 --> 03:00.400
-They're brown.
-I googled it. I do not
think it's going to work.

03:00.433 --> 03:03.400
-It won't. I always know
what people are trying to do
and it just makes me panic more.

03:03.433 --> 03:04.733
-Okay.

03:04.767 --> 03:07.467
-Arnold, on a scale
of one to ten, how elastic
is Josh's face?

03:07.500 --> 03:09.367
-Nine.
-Oh.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.567
-One being quite firm,
ten being, like
a deflated balloon.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.733
-Nine. Very elastic.
Very elastic face.

03:14.767 --> 03:17.200
-What do you think
about Tom's chest hair?

03:17.233 --> 03:19.367
-It's fine.
-You don't think
it's patchy?

03:19.400 --> 03:21.733
-Sure, but it's fine.

03:21.767 --> 03:23.300
-But my face isn't fine?

03:23.333 --> 03:25.333
-It's fine. I like your face.
I think you're hot.

03:25.367 --> 03:26.667
-Josh: Just very elastic.

03:26.700 --> 03:28.033
-Like an expensive cheese.

03:28.067 --> 03:30.133
-Or like a cheap cheese.

03:30.167 --> 03:32.467
Or like Benjamin Button
in his weird phase.

03:32.500 --> 03:36.533
-Okay, so some people die
when they take drugs like
this because they're allergic,

03:36.567 --> 03:39.733
but some people die when
they eat peanuts, so that's
not my major concern.

03:39.767 --> 03:42.033
I'm gonna get us
bottles of water.

03:44.333 --> 03:45.667
-Is he okay?

03:45.700 --> 03:47.400
-I think he's just
going to be fine.
How are you?

03:47.433 --> 03:48.567
-I am so terrified.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.333
-(excitedly)
I'm just so terrified!

03:50.367 --> 03:53.100
* One, two
One, two, three, four *

03:53.133 --> 03:55.067
* Ooh-ooh-ooh

03:55.100 --> 03:58.367
* Yeah, I'll be fine,
yeah, yeah *

03:58.400 --> 04:00.267
* Ooh-ooh-ooh

04:00.300 --> 04:02.233
-* Okay here
-* Ooh-ooh-ooh

04:02.267 --> 04:03.700
* Oh, the good Lord knows it

04:03.733 --> 04:04.833
* Ooh-ooh-ooh

04:04.867 --> 04:07.267
* Oh, the good Lord
knows it *

04:07.300 --> 04:10.700
* I left better behind
to be fine *

04:10.733 --> 04:12.500
* Yeah, yeah, fine

04:12.533 --> 04:15.200
* Make my mama
turn another blind eye *

04:15.233 --> 04:17.400
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

04:17.433 --> 04:20.200
* I left better behind
to be fine *

04:21.767 --> 04:24.800
-Oh, my God, yes. This is--
I'm just so happy, warm.

04:24.833 --> 04:28.067
Oh, Lord, okay.
We have to...

04:30.667 --> 04:33.100
-So I just quickly
want to say...

04:33.133 --> 04:35.500
Josh, I really appreciate
your friendship.

04:35.533 --> 04:38.500
-Yeah, that was very good.
Okay, can we do this
all the time?

04:38.533 --> 04:41.300
-Arnold. So happy
to have you in our lives,

04:41.333 --> 04:43.033
and that you make
my friend happy.

04:43.067 --> 04:46.600
-Oh, my God, yes.
Tom, I'm just so happy.

04:46.633 --> 04:50.533
-Yeah, and Josh,
I'm going to call
your dad.

04:50.567 --> 04:51.833
-Don't call my dad.

04:51.867 --> 04:54.700
-You know, I feel like
we've bonded and
I'm worried about him--

04:54.733 --> 04:56.200
-Yeah, we should
check on him.

04:56.233 --> 04:58.033
-You know, in a way,
I feel like he's calling me.

04:58.067 --> 05:01.100
-No, Arnold. Tom's not being
nice to my dad.
He's teasing my dad.

05:01.133 --> 05:03.733
-No, I'm-- (stammering)
I am not sure.

05:03.767 --> 05:05.067
-No, don't call my dad.

05:05.100 --> 05:07.767
-My God, guys, you should
run your hands through your
hair.

05:07.800 --> 05:12.500
It feels like a million tiny
masseuses just going at it
on your head.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.033
(line ringing)

05:17.300 --> 05:18.367
-(cell phone ringing)

05:18.400 --> 05:20.333
-Who is that?
-Ignore.

05:20.367 --> 05:22.600
-No, I don't think we should.
It could be an emergency.

05:22.633 --> 05:23.767
-Please, can we ignore it?

05:23.800 --> 05:26.033
-No. (groans)

05:31.200 --> 05:32.300
Hello.

05:32.333 --> 05:33.800
-Mae, it's Tom.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.167
-Oh, it's Tom.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.367
-Tom?
-Yeah.

05:37.400 --> 05:40.300
-Oh, shit. Something must be up.
-See.

05:40.333 --> 05:41.800
-Hi, Tom. This is Alan.

05:41.833 --> 05:45.400
-Tom.
-Yeah, hi. What's wrong?

05:45.433 --> 05:47.767
-Nothing. Nothing.
Everything is great.

05:47.800 --> 05:50.700
-Oh, okay. Well, hi.
Why did you call?

05:50.733 --> 05:53.200
-Why did I call?
-Yeah.

05:55.133 --> 05:57.533
-Um, just--
Just checking on you.

05:57.567 --> 05:58.833
-Oh, that's nice of you.

05:58.867 --> 06:01.433
-It is nice of me, isn't it?

06:01.467 --> 06:02.633
-Very nice.

06:02.667 --> 06:05.600
-Yeah. Look, I'm just
with Mae at the moment.

06:05.633 --> 06:08.533
We're really sorting things out,
so I better get back, okay?

06:08.567 --> 06:10.500
-Okay. Bye-bye.
-Bye.

06:14.167 --> 06:15.233
Oh!

06:18.200 --> 06:19.767
(rock song playing)

06:23.300 --> 06:24.467
-(all mouthing lyrics)
-* Sylvia

06:24.500 --> 06:26.433
* Yes, Mickey

06:26.467 --> 06:28.567
* How do you call
your lover boy? *

06:28.600 --> 06:30.667
* Come here, lover boy

06:30.700 --> 06:32.367
* And if he doesn't answer?

06:32.400 --> 06:34.433
* Oh, lover boy

06:34.467 --> 06:36.400
* And if he still
doesn't answer *

06:36.433 --> 06:38.333
* I simply say

06:38.367 --> 06:40.533
* Baby

06:40.567 --> 06:45.067
* Oh, baby

06:45.100 --> 06:48.833
* My sweet baby

06:48.867 --> 06:51.167
* You're the one

06:54.300 --> 06:56.233
* Baby

06:57.267 --> 07:00.200
-Oh, my God, guys.

07:00.233 --> 07:02.033
Let's go out.

07:02.067 --> 07:03.267
You two are perfect.

07:03.300 --> 07:06.533
We need to show you off
to the world like
the royal baby.

07:06.567 --> 07:09.067
Yeah, I know being
kicked out of home
would've been really hard,

07:09.100 --> 07:10.667
but we're so happy
to have you, you know.

07:10.700 --> 07:13.500
-Good things always
come out of bad things.
Always, always.

07:13.533 --> 07:17.467
-I just really feel like,
together we've created
a lovely little household.

07:17.500 --> 07:22.333
-I wish we could just fly there.
Imagine if we all flew there
in a pack

07:22.367 --> 07:26.367
and then everyone knew
about it, but we would
just be really humble.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.167
-(dance music playing)
-* Baby, baby, baby

07:29.867 --> 07:31.567
-* Baby, baby, baby

07:32.733 --> 07:33.733
-This is brilliant.

07:33.767 --> 07:35.067
-It's so good.

07:35.100 --> 07:36.767
-Hey, guys. Watch this.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.100
-Oh, yeah.

07:40.133 --> 07:41.233
-So talented.

07:42.367 --> 07:44.233
-Oh, okay, you're making out.

07:44.267 --> 07:45.833
That's good.
You should do that.

07:45.867 --> 07:47.067
That's great.

07:50.700 --> 07:54.233
-* Don't need no other lover
Don't need the day to come *

07:54.267 --> 07:57.167
* Just need the heat
and we'll get it on *

07:57.200 --> 07:59.500
* Who's the last standing?

07:59.533 --> 08:02.133
* Who's the last lover
to call? *

08:02.167 --> 08:05.233
* Pretty lover
Pretty lover *

08:05.267 --> 08:10.067
* Who's gonna make you, take you
to the solar withdrawal *

08:10.100 --> 08:12.467
* Pretty lovers
are falling for ya *

08:13.667 --> 08:14.667
-Hi, I'm Ella.

08:14.700 --> 08:17.433
-Tom. Josh. Arnold.

08:17.467 --> 08:19.333
We're taking MDMA
for the first time.

08:19.367 --> 08:21.167
-Fun!

08:21.200 --> 08:23.100
I'm here with work friends.

08:23.133 --> 08:24.733
They keep talking
about CrossFit.

08:24.767 --> 08:27.633
-Yuck. I don't do
any exercise ever.

08:27.667 --> 08:30.033
-Good.
-Have you ever done MDMA?

08:30.067 --> 08:31.467
-Yes. Yes, I have.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.667
-What do you think
should be our next adventure?

08:34.667 --> 08:36.267
-Let's go for a run.

08:36.300 --> 08:38.300
-What?
-You have to run.

08:40.300 --> 08:43.700
-* Backstreet's back
All right! *

08:43.733 --> 08:45.800
-I have to go.
I'm very busy.

08:51.133 --> 08:54.000
* Oh, my God,
we're back again *

08:55.400 --> 08:59.633
* Brothers, sisters,
everybody sing *

08:59.667 --> 09:02.633
* Gonna bring the flavor,
show you how *

09:04.167 --> 09:08.133
* Gotta question for you
better answer now, yeah *

09:08.167 --> 09:09.533
* Am I original?

09:09.567 --> 09:10.600
-(Tom groans)

09:10.633 --> 09:13.467
-Ella, Ella, come back.
-Shit. Shit.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.533
-Tom, babe, hi.

09:15.567 --> 09:17.333
Can you do me a favor?
-Yeah?

09:17.367 --> 09:18.833
-Don't look at your arm. Okay?

09:18.867 --> 09:20.733
-Oh, no, Josh!
-That's Tom.

09:20.767 --> 09:22.700
-Oh, no, Tom.
Did you hit your head?

09:22.733 --> 09:25.133
-Yeah.
-Okay.

09:25.167 --> 09:27.533
-We should call
an ambulance because a guy
that I knew hit his head once

09:27.567 --> 09:30.433
and he thought it was nothing,
and then his brain swelled and
he died.

09:30.467 --> 09:32.100
-Oh, no!
-He wasn't very likable.

09:32.133 --> 09:35.233
-Also we should call
an ambulance 'cause Tom's arm
is not pointing the right way.

09:35.267 --> 09:36.767
-Oh, no.
-How did you fall?

09:36.800 --> 09:37.900
-I don't know.

09:37.933 --> 09:41.700
The ground was there
and then it wasn't there
anymore.

09:41.733 --> 09:42.733
-Did it look cool?

09:42.767 --> 09:45.733
-It looked like a giraffe
being tranquilized.

09:45.767 --> 09:46.800
-What should I do?

09:46.833 --> 09:50.067
-Kiss me.
You should kiss me.

09:50.100 --> 09:51.800
* Doo-wah

09:51.833 --> 09:54.033
* Doo-wah, doo-wah

09:54.067 --> 09:58.233
-Hi, my friend, his arm's
not facing the right way
and he hit his head.

09:58.267 --> 10:00.633
He's Josh's best friend,
but he's my friend as well.

10:04.567 --> 10:06.367
-So, how is
everybody doing?

10:06.400 --> 10:08.700
-Tom keeps holding
my hand.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.633
-Why are you holding
Arnold's hand, Tom?

10:10.667 --> 10:11.500
-It's nice.

10:11.533 --> 10:14.333
-Are you okay with that, Arnold?
-Yeah.

10:14.367 --> 10:16.100
-Thank you so much
for driving us, Evan.

10:16.133 --> 10:17.300
-Yeah, thanks for
driving us, Evan.

10:18.333 --> 10:19.300
-We don't get sirens?

10:19.333 --> 10:23.433
-No.
-Aw. Does that talk
to the hospital?

10:23.467 --> 10:26.533
Attention hospital,
very important.
Evan is hot.

10:26.567 --> 10:29.233
-Sorry about that.
That was a passenger
mucking about. Over.

10:29.267 --> 10:30.467
-Oh, my God,
what are you doing?

10:30.500 --> 10:32.400
-I'm so sorry.
Was I really bad?

10:32.433 --> 10:34.667
-Very bad.
-Oh, no, why'd I do that?

10:34.700 --> 10:38.067
I'm so sorry, Evan.
I'm so sorry.
-It's fine.

10:38.100 --> 10:40.733
-Oh, and Evan, I bet
everyone's just always
bringing up your looks.

10:40.767 --> 10:42.833
-Why did you laugh?
Is he right?

10:42.867 --> 10:44.633
-So right.
-He's beautiful.

10:44.667 --> 10:47.367
-You have some cheap
nickname for him, like
in Grey's Anatomy?

10:47.400 --> 10:49.567
-No, that'd be good
though, wouldn't it, Evan?

10:49.600 --> 10:50.600
-Not good.

10:50.633 --> 10:53.200
-Yeah, like "The Face."
-Yeah.

10:53.233 --> 10:56.300
Evan, from now on
we're going to call
you "The Face."

10:56.333 --> 11:00.433
-Aw, that's not okay though,
'cause clearly Evan is a very
talented medical professional.

11:00.467 --> 11:02.633
I'm sure he's sick
to bloody death

11:02.667 --> 11:05.767
of everyone always talking about
his perfect face.

11:05.800 --> 11:06.767
Are you?

11:06.800 --> 11:09.100
-Forget it.
-Evan?

11:09.133 --> 11:10.600
Have I upset The Face?

11:12.100 --> 11:14.333
-Aw, he's so handsome
when he's sad.

11:14.367 --> 11:17.400
-Oh, Josh, no,
that's objectifying him.
That's not okay.

11:17.433 --> 11:19.733
-Yeah, sorry for
objectifying you, Face.

11:19.767 --> 11:22.633
-I hereby name you "Big Heart."

11:32.300 --> 11:34.400
-Hey, Arnold, Josh said
you were heaps smart.

11:34.433 --> 11:36.667
Say something smart.
-Did you say I was smart?

11:36.700 --> 11:40.667
-Book smart, not like,
street smarts, okay.
He can't use an iron.

11:40.700 --> 11:44.133
-Can you time travel?
-Can I time travel?

11:44.167 --> 11:46.200
-Oh, me, like,
do you know how?

11:47.367 --> 11:49.167
-Um, okay.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.933
Well... (clears throat)

11:50.967 --> 11:53.133
The first thing you need to
understand when you're talking
about time travel is that...

11:53.167 --> 11:55.033
-Here we go.
-...everything is moving
at different speeds

11:55.067 --> 11:57.200
like a constant speed
in time and space

11:57.233 --> 11:58.600
relative to something
else, okay?

11:58.633 --> 12:00.167
-This got boring
quickly, didn't it?

12:00.200 --> 12:03.267
-No, everything in the universe
is moving at all sorts of
different speeds,

12:03.300 --> 12:05.600
and the faster and faster
you go, the more
time slows down.

12:05.633 --> 12:06.667
-How fast am I moving?

12:06.700 --> 12:09.333
-Well, it's relative.
-Relative, like, your mum,

12:09.367 --> 12:11.767
who's someone I had sex with?
-Boom.

12:11.800 --> 12:14.333
-No, to the Earth's rotation.

12:14.367 --> 12:17.133
If you increase your velocity,
like if you get in a plane,

12:17.167 --> 12:19.267
or if I chase you...
-Chase me now.

12:19.300 --> 12:22.133
-...your subjective personal
time frame is slowing down. No.
-Arnold, chase me now.

12:22.167 --> 12:24.033
-It's so small,
we need atomic clocks
to measure it.

12:24.067 --> 12:25.500
-You just won't stop
until you finish, will you?

12:25.533 --> 12:27.800
-I think I'm gonna get
to the point where you think
it's interesting.

12:27.833 --> 12:29.567
-You just can't stop.
I think I'm in love with you.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.567
-If you put an atomic clock
at the top of the mountain

12:31.600 --> 12:33.467
and then one at the very
bottom of the ocean--

12:33.500 --> 12:35.267
-Nah, I would never put
an atomic clock anywhere, so...

12:35.300 --> 12:40.267
-The one higher up would tick
several femtoseconds slower
than the one at the very bottom,

12:40.300 --> 12:41.400
'cause it's moving faster.

12:41.433 --> 12:43.433
-That is interesting, but...
-Thank you.

12:43.467 --> 12:46.700
-...will I ever be able
to pet a brontosaurus,
or Frank Sinatra?

12:46.733 --> 12:49.367
-No, probably not.
I'm sorry.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.567
-So, we've established
that Arnold is the smartest.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.433
-Did we establish
he was the smartest?
-Yeah.

12:53.467 --> 12:55.633
-"Femtoseconds"?
It's nonsense.

12:55.667 --> 12:57.433
-Who is the kindest?

12:57.467 --> 12:58.667
-Oh, it's Arnold, isn't it?

12:58.700 --> 13:00.700
-Who'd be most likely
to fetch water if you're
hungover?

13:00.733 --> 13:01.900
-Yes, yes,
Arnold, Arnold.

13:01.933 --> 13:04.800
-Which one of you would be
in charge after a plane crash?

13:04.833 --> 13:08.733
-Oh, that's Josh.
-Me. I would just love to take
charge after a plane crash.

13:08.767 --> 13:10.267
I mean, that is the dream.

13:10.300 --> 13:12.267
-Are you two monogamous?
-Yes.

13:12.300 --> 13:15.367
-Um, oh...
We haven't discussed it yet.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.600
-Ooh, tension.

13:17.633 --> 13:19.367
-No tension. We just have
not discussed it yet.

13:19.400 --> 13:20.567
-Can we discuss it now?
-No.

13:20.600 --> 13:21.800
-Come on.
-No.

13:25.567 --> 13:28.200
-What is Gondwanaland?

13:28.233 --> 13:32.000
'Cause I remember learning
about Gondwanaland and Laurasia,
but I don't know why.

13:36.500 --> 13:39.400
-I thought Gondwanaland
was what the Aboriginal
people called Australia.

13:39.433 --> 13:40.733
-No.
-No.

13:40.767 --> 13:42.633
-No, it's not that.
They had hundreds
of different languages.

13:42.667 --> 13:45.367
-Definitely not that.
-No way. Something
to do with volcanoes?

13:48.800 --> 13:49.767
-I don't know.

13:49.800 --> 13:52.833
-I think, maybe,
I should not
have kissed Tom.

13:52.867 --> 13:55.400
-Oh, come on.
Tom's all right.

13:55.433 --> 13:57.300
-I've got a boyfriend.

13:57.333 --> 13:58.600
-A good boyfriend?

13:58.633 --> 14:00.733
-I think so.

14:00.767 --> 14:01.933
-Why isn't he out tonight?

14:01.967 --> 14:04.433
-He never comes out.
He doesn't like me
when I'm out.

14:04.467 --> 14:07.533
-What?
-He doesn't like you
when you are out,

14:07.567 --> 14:09.433
like out of the house?

14:09.467 --> 14:10.800
-No, just like--

14:11.867 --> 14:13.567
Yeah.
-Well, what's he doing?

14:13.600 --> 14:16.467
-Probably watching West Wing
episodes, even though he
promised to watch it together.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.167
-He sounds awful.

14:18.200 --> 14:20.333
-Let's not jump to conclusions.
We don't know Ella that well.

14:20.367 --> 14:21.533
Maybe she's awful.
Maybe he's right.

14:21.567 --> 14:25.333
-Every time I eat sweet things,
he asks me if I need them.

14:25.367 --> 14:28.433
Like, of course, I don't need
them, they're fun. Why can't
he see that they're fun?

14:28.467 --> 14:29.900
-Is he a dentist?

14:29.933 --> 14:33.600
-One time we went on
a roller coaster and there
was a really long queue,

14:33.633 --> 14:36.167
and when the guy asked
if there were any singles
in the crowd,

14:36.200 --> 14:37.467
he put his hand up...
-No.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.033
-...because he couldn't
be bothered waiting
in line anymore.

14:39.067 --> 14:43.133
And so, I had to go on
the next round and sit next to
this really nervous mum,

14:43.167 --> 14:45.267
who was actually
totally delightful,
but he didn't know that.

14:45.300 --> 14:46.733
-No, Ella, that man,
he's the devil.

14:46.767 --> 14:48.233
-He never goes down on me.

14:48.267 --> 14:51.100
-Never?

14:51.133 --> 14:54.767
-I mean, fair enough, you know,
I wouldn't go down on you,
but the roller coaster--

14:54.800 --> 14:55.800
He's the devil.

14:55.833 --> 14:59.000
-Like once,
out of guilt.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.233
The day after
he cheated on me.

15:02.267 --> 15:06.067
-What the hell? You need
to go and break up
with that man right now.

15:06.100 --> 15:07.433
-Get rid of him.

15:09.833 --> 15:11.133
-I'm nervous.

15:15.067 --> 15:16.367
-Yeah. Good luck.

15:19.767 --> 15:21.267
-I think I met
a girl tonight,

15:21.300 --> 15:22.567
and we kissed
and it was incredible.

15:23.700 --> 15:26.233
But I had just tripped
and done this,

15:26.267 --> 15:28.300
so there was
a lot going on.

15:28.333 --> 15:31.200
It's difficult to distinguish
all of that from how good
the kiss was, you know?

15:31.233 --> 15:32.367
-(giggling)

15:34.167 --> 15:35.400
-Will you kiss anyone tonight?

15:36.467 --> 15:37.733
-Probably my husband.

15:37.767 --> 15:39.100
-Nice one.

15:44.700 --> 15:46.400
-My face is turning
into my dad.

15:46.433 --> 15:48.633
-Don't you say that
about my boyfriend.

15:48.667 --> 15:50.367
-I'm gonna get a face-lift.
-No.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.067
-I am more likable like this.

15:52.100 --> 15:54.300
-I like your face.

15:54.333 --> 15:56.167
-No, I'm going to get a new one.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.200
-Gonna get
Cameron Diaz's face.
-You can't afford it.

15:58.233 --> 16:00.700
-I'm going to go to Mexico
and ask for Cameron Diaz's
face.

16:00.733 --> 16:03.333
-I don't know how many
more times I'm meant to say
not to do it.

16:03.367 --> 16:04.700
-Well, you wouldn't understand,
would you?

16:04.733 --> 16:06.500
Your face is so tight.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.067
Nothing moves.

16:10.100 --> 16:11.300
It's too tight,
if anything.

16:13.167 --> 16:15.300
Nothing moves.
Pull on my face.
Ridiculous.

16:19.467 --> 16:22.733
-Oh. I'm worried
I'm going to stretch
it more.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.533
-Ella: So he didn't react.

16:25.567 --> 16:29.233
He said, "Fine,
what do you want me to say?"

16:29.267 --> 16:31.733
And so, I started crying,
'cause I thought I should,

16:31.767 --> 16:35.133
and he said,
"This performance
is only for you."

16:35.167 --> 16:37.733
So I guess
he does know me well.

16:37.767 --> 16:39.633
And then I hung up.

16:39.667 --> 16:42.100
And then I got worried
that no one ever loved me.

16:42.133 --> 16:43.467
So I bought
all the flowers.

16:44.467 --> 16:45.633
-They're very nice.

16:49.333 --> 16:51.500
-(cell phone ringing)

16:54.567 --> 16:55.600
-Hello.

16:55.633 --> 16:58.600
-She dumped me.
-Oh, sh--

16:58.633 --> 17:01.100
Alan, God, shit,
I'm so sorry.

17:01.133 --> 17:04.633
-Yeah. Yeah. She said
after we got back together
that she wasn't happy.

17:04.667 --> 17:07.733
I mean, she said,
she thought she would be
happy, but she wasn't.

17:07.767 --> 17:10.167
-But she cheated on you.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.733
Just, if someone was
gonna break up with me,

17:12.767 --> 17:16.333
I wouldn't want them
to also tell me that
they cheated on me.

17:16.367 --> 17:18.400
I mean, what's the point?
Shit.

17:19.833 --> 17:22.200
-Yeah, she's upstairs
with Grace.

17:22.233 --> 17:25.100
-Did you know the reason
your heart physically hurts
when it breaks?

17:25.133 --> 17:27.367
It's because your body doesn't
understand what's going on.

17:28.833 --> 17:30.667
Your body doesn't know
you broke up with someone,

17:30.700 --> 17:32.433
it just assumes
you must be in trouble,

17:32.467 --> 17:34.633
like poisoned or something,
so it's like, "Oh, my God,

17:34.667 --> 17:38.833
this guy just ate an apple
from a witch. Quick, heart, beat
faster, we need action now."

17:38.867 --> 17:40.133
-You boyfriend's the witch.

17:40.167 --> 17:42.733
-Warlock.
-You broke up with him, yeah?

17:42.767 --> 17:44.233
You're the winner.
You win the breakup.

17:45.433 --> 17:47.067
-Yeah!
-(cell phone ringing)

17:47.100 --> 17:48.467
-Oh, that's weird.

17:50.233 --> 17:51.400
Hey, Mae,
what's happening?

17:51.433 --> 17:52.633
-Hey, Josh,
are you with Tom?

17:52.667 --> 17:54.000
-No, why?

17:55.300 --> 17:57.600
-Josh, I broke up
with your father.

17:57.633 --> 18:00.233
-Aw, are you okay?

18:00.267 --> 18:02.300
-He called Tom.
Do you know why?

18:02.333 --> 18:05.367
-No. No, I do not.

18:05.400 --> 18:08.833
-I tried to keep it
together for Grace, but...

18:08.867 --> 18:13.167
I think she is better off
with two happy parents apart,

18:13.200 --> 18:14.833
than two sad ones together.

18:14.867 --> 18:17.267
-Yeah, yeah. I agree.

18:17.300 --> 18:19.533
Kids can always tell, Mae.

18:19.567 --> 18:22.600
I was just super relieved
when Mum and Dad got divorced.

18:22.633 --> 18:24.167
-That's nice of you to say.

18:24.200 --> 18:27.200
I was worried that
calling you would
be awful.

18:27.233 --> 18:28.767
-Why? What's wrong with me?

18:28.800 --> 18:30.000
-You can only
emotionally engage

18:30.033 --> 18:32.633
with the story,
if the characters are
animal characters,

18:32.667 --> 18:35.300
Josh, like a child.

18:35.333 --> 18:37.800
-Why am I getting
criticized?

18:37.833 --> 18:40.633
Are you breaking with me?
Don't break up with me, Mae.

18:40.667 --> 18:43.667
I'll eat heaps
and then I'll get fat... again.

18:43.700 --> 18:45.033
-(laughing)

18:47.133 --> 18:49.233
-I just heard Mae laugh.
-What?

18:49.267 --> 18:51.067
-Why would she
be laughing?

18:51.100 --> 18:53.267
-Maybe Grace farted.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.533
-And now it's all
there in front of me.

18:56.567 --> 18:59.667
-Three years of thrash
that I didn't realize was trash

18:59.700 --> 19:02.000
even though everybody
told me it was trash.

19:03.633 --> 19:05.500
God, this is humiliating.

19:07.500 --> 19:08.733
I forgot about this part.

19:10.433 --> 19:13.600
Now I have to tell
all my friends

19:13.633 --> 19:15.767
that I was wrong
and they were right.

19:21.467 --> 19:23.133
-We had a good
relationship, but...

19:25.467 --> 19:27.433
this is not my life.

19:30.367 --> 19:32.800
This is... his life.

19:32.833 --> 19:35.533
-Yeah, I understand.

19:35.567 --> 19:37.600
-Why don't I know
what's good for me?

19:39.067 --> 19:40.733
I should be...

19:40.767 --> 19:44.533
the foremost expert on what's
good for me, but I'm not.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.333
-I just feel like a fool.

19:47.367 --> 19:52.300
You know, I don't know how
I ever let myself believe

19:52.333 --> 19:53.800
I could make her happy.

19:53.833 --> 19:56.233
-You did make her happy.

19:56.267 --> 19:59.667
Then she changed into someone
that you couldn't make happy.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.433
-I'm not sure.

20:05.500 --> 20:06.700
-Josh: Okay, bye.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.233
-(sobbing)

20:36.100 --> 20:37.167
-We're at the hospital.

20:38.200 --> 20:39.433
-You're at the hospital?

20:39.467 --> 20:41.700
-Yeah, I tripped.
-How did you trip?

20:42.733 --> 20:44.100
-Fell.

20:44.133 --> 20:45.633
-Yeah, why did you fall?

20:45.667 --> 20:48.267
-I didn't mean to.

20:48.300 --> 20:50.133
-You weren't high, were you?

20:52.767 --> 20:54.767
-Um... no.

20:56.600 --> 20:58.400
-Are you lying to me, Tom?

20:59.767 --> 21:01.367
-I... just...

21:02.667 --> 21:03.667
...don't know?

21:03.700 --> 21:06.600
-You were on drugs.
What drugs?

21:06.633 --> 21:08.033
You'll only make it
worse by lying.

21:09.067 --> 21:10.100
-MDMA.

21:10.133 --> 21:13.600
-Fucking hell.
Fucking stupid kids.

21:13.633 --> 21:15.067
Right, I'm coming to get you.

21:15.100 --> 21:17.233
You are not too old
for me to come and get you.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.000
-(cell phone ringing)

21:32.800 --> 21:35.667
-So I was just having
a bit of a chat
with your dad...

21:35.700 --> 21:39.133
and the subject of those
drugs we took came up,

21:39.167 --> 21:41.200
and...

21:41.233 --> 21:45.033
now he knows about
those drugs we took.

21:45.067 --> 21:47.433
-Why are you always telling
my dad things? It's weird.

21:47.467 --> 21:49.267
Are you trying
to steal my dad?

21:49.300 --> 21:52.200
I feel like I'm in some
sort of weird dad-son
triangle.

21:52.233 --> 21:54.533
-He was just being so open
with me, I can't lie to him.

21:54.567 --> 21:56.200
His heart is too gentle.

21:57.767 --> 21:59.567
-You betrayed me like Judas.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.800
-You are Jesus.
You know this, right?

22:03.067 --> 22:04.467
-Tom thinks I'm not Jesus.

22:05.633 --> 22:08.000
-(shouting) Jesus Christ!

22:10.267 --> 22:12.233
-A wheelchair.
-Ella: I made him.

22:12.267 --> 22:14.333
-Rough night, eh?

22:14.367 --> 22:17.067
-Yes, I have had a rough
fucking night, not helped
by you, thanks.

22:17.100 --> 22:18.567
Let's just go.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.100
-Dad...

22:20.133 --> 22:21.467
-This is so embarrassing, Josh.

22:21.500 --> 22:25.167
-I mean, you really
did not have to come.

22:25.200 --> 22:27.433
-You really cannot
look after yourself,
can you?

22:28.700 --> 22:30.167
Drugs...

22:30.200 --> 22:31.733
-Hi, I'm Ella.

22:31.767 --> 22:34.500
-I thought you're over
the teen party phase.

22:34.533 --> 22:37.400
-Dad, I promise you, I never
partied as a teen, okay?

22:37.433 --> 22:38.533
Really, you can just go home.

22:38.567 --> 22:40.500
-I'm already here.

22:40.533 --> 22:43.333
I mean, thank fuck
you're alive!

22:44.367 --> 22:46.033
Where'd you get
the drugs from, hmm?

22:46.067 --> 22:48.233
And why do you
trust them?

22:48.267 --> 22:49.833
Were they trustworthy?

22:49.867 --> 22:51.200
-Tom got them.

22:54.200 --> 22:56.700
-You've really
disappointed me, Tom.
-Sorry.

22:56.733 --> 23:00.300
-I mean, what does MDMA
even bloody stand for?

23:00.333 --> 23:02.333
-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine.

23:05.100 --> 23:06.300
-You know I've been
worried sick.

23:08.267 --> 23:11.467
I mean, of course,
I'm gonna think the
bloody worst. Christ!

23:11.500 --> 23:13.700
First I make my wife
go mental,

23:13.733 --> 23:17.200
and then I send
my partner into the arms
of a crazed fetishist.

23:17.233 --> 23:20.767
So, you know, it's not much
of a surprise to find out
I'm a shit father, too.

23:20.800 --> 23:24.567
Couldn't even raise
my own son well enough
not to become a fucking junkie!

23:25.700 --> 23:27.200
And you know, Tom...

23:28.667 --> 23:30.733
I thought we had
a relationship,

23:30.767 --> 23:34.433
I didn't realize when we were
hanging out, that you were
so off your face,

23:34.467 --> 23:35.833
you'd split your
bloody wrist open.

23:35.867 --> 23:37.467
-I'm sorry.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.733
-Fuck! Fuck!

23:39.767 --> 23:41.200
Fuck!

23:42.833 --> 23:44.300
-Okay, Dad, okay.

23:45.400 --> 23:46.367
All right?

23:50.700 --> 23:52.133
-I'm sorry. I love you.

23:57.633 --> 23:59.767
No, I'm all right. Thanks.

24:10.667 --> 24:13.767
You're a very pretty girl.
Is this the girl that
you mentioned, Tom?

24:17.167 --> 24:18.667
(clears throat) Right.

24:18.700 --> 24:19.767
You guys ready?
