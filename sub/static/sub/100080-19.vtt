07:25.945 --> 07:27.697
The shooter Tan bagged
is Evander Keats.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.824
Oceanside native. He joined
the North Foothill Posse

07:29.907 --> 07:31.033
back in '09.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.035
He's got a small run
of low-level priors.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.829
Disorderly conduct
and simple assault.

07:34.912 --> 07:36.706
No list of accomplices,
and now he's lawyered up

07:36.789 --> 07:38.040
and he ain't telling us jack.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.500
You think it's
a paid hit?

07:39.584 --> 07:41.043
I worked the Foothill Posse
seven years ago.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.670
Don't know why they'd
come for me now.

07:42.753 --> 07:43.671
Maybe this will help.

07:43.754 --> 07:46.674
Ballistics came back
on the shells from the café.

07:46.757 --> 07:49.385
They match shells from another
shooting four hours ago

07:49.468 --> 07:52.221
in Mar Vista and another,
three hours ago in Brentwood.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.849
Looks like our shooters
killed two other victims
before coming for Tan.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.225
HONDO: A mechanic
and a city prosecutor.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.602
This has to be connected
to an old case.

07:57.685 --> 07:59.061
Wait a minute.
I know them.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.439
Back in 2013, that mechanic
was a witness

08:01.522 --> 08:03.065
for that prosecutor.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.026
They both helped put away
Conor Pope.

08:05.109 --> 08:06.861
L.A.'s self-proclaimed
meth king.

08:06.944 --> 08:09.363
How are you tied in?

08:06.944 --> 08:09.363
I was Pope's
arresting officer.

08:09.447 --> 08:12.408
This says Pope's been
incarcerated since 2013,
serving 50 years.

08:12.491 --> 08:14.285
If he wanted to put out a
contract hit from behind bars,

08:14.368 --> 08:15.411
why wait till now?

08:15.494 --> 08:17.038

there in person.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.794
Bragged to his cellmate
that he was finally
gonna get his payback.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.588
Apparently he's got
a list of targets.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.131
Grabbed this
from your attack, too.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.761
Never thought I'd have
to see that face again.

08:31.844 --> 08:34.680
Yeah, well, now he's got to
worry about seeing<i> our</i> faces.

08:36.515 --> 08:38.559
♪ ♪

09:11.550 --> 09:13.177
I really have to get to Metro.
What's taking so long?

09:13.261 --> 09:14.595
I'm just submitting
a reporting statement.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.597
I can't find the citation
in last night's log.

09:16.681 --> 09:17.848
Jacob Carter.
Bagged on a DUI.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.141
I can't find him,
Officer Alonso.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.769
No one by that name was booked.

09:21.852 --> 09:22.770
Can you please check again?

09:22.853 --> 09:24.522
It was just off Los Feliz.

09:24.605 --> 09:26.232
He would have been
brought in around 11:00.

09:26.315 --> 09:28.025
I don't know what to tell you.
He's not here.

09:26.315 --> 09:28.025
(sighs)

09:29.110 --> 09:30.152
That's impossible.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.321
I watched him get in the back
of a cruiser myself.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.990
Sorry. If he's not
in the system,

09:34.073 --> 09:35.533
he was never processed.

09:36.784 --> 09:38.661
What else do we know
about Conor Pope?

09:38.744 --> 09:41.163
He ran the city's largest
meth game a decade back.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.541
Cooked up one of the most potent
strains in SoCal.

09:43.624 --> 09:45.543
Street cops called it
Crystal Death.

09:45.626 --> 09:48.337
He used bikers from the
Foothill Posse for distribution.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.839
If people weren't
killing themselves with it,

09:49.922 --> 09:51.382
they were killing
someone else over it.

09:51.465 --> 09:53.342
While I was on Vice in 2013,
a whole task force

09:53.426 --> 09:55.011
had been created
just to bring this guy down.

09:55.094 --> 09:56.387
Okay, if this stuff
was everywhere,

09:56.470 --> 09:57.847
why did it take so
long to nail him?

09:57.930 --> 09:59.390
We couldn't find anything
connecting Pope directly

09:59.473 --> 10:00.850
to his empire.
He ran a tight ship.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.351
Knew all the rules,
how to bend them,

10:02.435 --> 10:03.686
when and where to break them.

10:03.769 --> 10:04.729
You worked the case,
too, Lieutenant?

10:04.812 --> 10:06.647
Oh, yeah. I was in Hollywood
Division at the time.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.524
We were all across it.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.524
Okay, how'd you
finally get him?

10:08.607 --> 10:10.359
Well, to be honest,
we got lucky.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.403
I was on dump detail,
found a business ledger

10:12.486 --> 10:14.363
in his trash-- connected his
income, supply, customers.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.198
It was just the
smoking gun we needed.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.617
The D.A. used it to convict,
sent his ass away for good.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.703
LUCA: Yeah, or so we thought.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.703
HONDO: Pope's got a kill list

10:20.786 --> 10:22.413
targeting the people
who put him in prison.

10:22.496 --> 10:25.374
Witness, prosecutor and Tan
were the first three targets.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.500
Attorneys, judges, jurors,

10:26.584 --> 10:27.835
other witnesses
could all be next.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.045
Scoop up potential targets,

10:29.128 --> 10:30.379
have them brought
to HQ for protection.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.340
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
Okay, that's defense.

10:32.423 --> 10:34.216
What's our plan on offense
to track down Conor Pope?

10:34.300 --> 10:35.718
His girlfriend, Jacinda Herrera.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.803
She was the last one
to visit him in prison.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.055
That's one place to start.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.766
Luca, have Chris pick her up
with a patrol unit.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.766
Got it.

10:41.849 --> 10:43.392
I got an old source
I want to visit,

10:43.476 --> 10:45.895
guy who runs a gear shop
the Posse brings their bikes to.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.855
(phone ringing)

10:45.978 --> 10:47.855
Well, let's hope
he still likes you.

10:47.938 --> 10:49.857
HONDO:
Hey, Tan. Gear up.

10:49.940 --> 10:51.776
I'll meet you outside
in a minute.

10:54.862 --> 10:56.238
HONDO:
Nichelle.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.239
Hey, bae.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.239
Hey.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.699
Everything all right?

10:58.783 --> 11:01.702
I think I left my wallet
at your place last night.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.372
Guess I had one too many glasses
with your sister.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.290
Thank god for Uber.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.290
Well, you guys
hit it off.

11:06.374 --> 11:09.085
If we didn't run out of wine,
we might have gone till dawn.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.419
(both laugh)

11:10.503 --> 11:12.421
So, do you mind if I grab
your house keys?

11:12.505 --> 11:14.256
I'll bring them back when I pick
you up tonight before the gala.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.466
Yeah. They're
in my car.

11:15.549 --> 11:16.926
Come on.

11:15.549 --> 11:16.926
Okay.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.928
I'm looking forward to it.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.721
(chuckles)

11:20.805 --> 11:23.599
If Winnie is still around, you
should invite her to the party.

11:23.682 --> 11:26.435
Okay. I can ask her, I just...

11:26.519 --> 11:28.104
sort of pictured
just us tonight.

11:28.187 --> 11:32.775
That's sweet, but with all
the big money Othella invited,

11:32.858 --> 11:34.318
I'll be working the room
all night.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.821
Between that, keeping my parents
occupied, my friends...

11:36.904 --> 11:38.823
Your parents are coming?

11:38.906 --> 11:40.991
It's all they've been talking
about since I told them.

11:41.075 --> 11:42.743
I don't know who they're more
excited to meet,

11:42.827 --> 11:45.079
Othella Baker
or my SWAT boyfriend.

11:45.162 --> 11:47.415
(both chuckle)

11:45.162 --> 11:47.415
Well, yeah, sure,
I'll check in with Winnie.

11:47.498 --> 11:49.417
I know she loves
that type of stuff.

11:47.498 --> 11:49.417
Mm.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.461
But look, I got to run right
now. We're about to roll out.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.880
But I'll see you tonight
unless work gets in the way.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.675
Okay. Stay safe.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.675
All right. Yeah.

11:59.718 --> 12:02.138
Bonnie's not picking up.
I just want to make sure

12:02.221 --> 12:04.140
she got to the hotel okay.

12:02.221 --> 12:04.140
Hey, you'd be the first

12:04.223 --> 12:05.808
to hear if she didn't.
She's in good hands.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.435
That's not what
I'm worried about.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.311
She watched me shoot someone,
knock another guy out.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.813
The way she looked
at me after,

12:10.896 --> 12:12.565
it was like
she was afraid of me.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.565
You're worried

12:12.648 --> 12:13.983
she saw a side of you
only the bad guys should.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.693
Yeah. And I had
the whole day planned.

12:15.776 --> 12:18.487
Every detail down to the minute
before I got on one knee.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.030
Wait, wait.
Hold on a minute.

12:20.114 --> 12:21.323
You were gonna propose today?

12:21.407 --> 12:23.284
Yeah. Just after brunch.

12:23.367 --> 12:25.035
(laughs): Oh, man. Wow.

12:23.367 --> 12:25.035
Yeah, and on
top of that,

12:25.119 --> 12:26.495
I lost the ring.

12:26.579 --> 12:27.872
You what?

12:26.579 --> 12:27.872
At the restaurant.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.498
Pope's guys
started shooting at me,

12:29.582 --> 12:31.417
everything went flying.
I couldn't find it afterwards.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.294
Okay. I'll talk
to the guys on the scene.

12:33.377 --> 12:35.296
M.E.s, CSIs,
have them take a look.

12:35.379 --> 12:36.881
It's a lost cause, man.

12:36.964 --> 12:38.299
Hey, listen.

12:38.382 --> 12:40.551
You and Bonnie
are gold together.

12:40.634 --> 12:42.303
I quit the apps
'cause I wanted something

12:42.386 --> 12:43.512
like what you two have.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.139
And that led me
to meet Molly.

12:45.222 --> 12:46.474
So let me work on the ring.

12:49.852 --> 12:52.730
Officer Tan. It's been a while.

12:52.813 --> 12:55.524
I stopped chasing the
Foothill Posse when I left Vice.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.193
Now they're chasing me.

13:00.821 --> 13:03.115
Did you know?

13:04.325 --> 13:06.535
A guy like Pope
breaks out of prison?

13:06.619 --> 13:07.995
Everyone knows.

13:08.078 --> 13:10.539
That I was on his kill list?

13:08.078 --> 13:10.539
I just heard about it

13:10.623 --> 13:12.666
from some Foothill Posse guys
in here getting tune-ups.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.585
There's nothing I could do
to stop it from happening.

13:14.668 --> 13:16.212
It never occurred to you
to pick up the phone?

13:16.295 --> 13:19.089
And risk Pope putting me
on his list?

13:19.173 --> 13:20.674
There's no stopping
a man like that.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.426
Yeah, certainly not
with your help.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.428
Prison break?
Hit crew?

13:24.512 --> 13:25.679
That's a lot to put together
from a cell,

13:25.763 --> 13:27.515
and he had to pay for it.
How'd he do it?

13:29.475 --> 13:32.228
Before he went away,
Pope left a huge cache

13:32.311 --> 13:34.772
of benzyl cyanide
in one of his old labs.

13:34.855 --> 13:37.066
He promised it to the Posse
if they broke him out.

13:37.149 --> 13:38.609
There's enough in there

13:38.692 --> 13:41.278
to make ten million dollars'
worth of meth.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.738
Do you know where
his old lab is?

13:42.821 --> 13:44.073
TAN:
McKenna,

13:44.156 --> 13:45.866
he tried to kill me.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.244
And he hurt innocent civilians.
Do the right thing here.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.579
For a change.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.627
Let me call my guy.

14:00.965 --> 14:02.967
HICKS:
Ms. Herrera.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.718
I heard our officers
had a little trouble

14:04.802 --> 14:05.970
convincing you to come in.

14:06.053 --> 14:07.596
CHRIS:
You certainly know
your rights.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.557
Verbal abuse doesn't count
as assaulting an officer.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.559
I don't like cops, okay?

14:11.642 --> 14:13.394
You jammed my boyfriend up,
it ain't gonna work on me.

14:13.477 --> 14:15.020
Your boyfriend's
as bad as they come.

14:15.104 --> 14:16.438
We both know where the money
for that McMansion

14:16.522 --> 14:18.607
we dragged you out of came from.

14:18.691 --> 14:19.608
LUCA:
Yeah, so don't pretend
he got a raw deal.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.944
Okay? It was a good bust.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.572
(laughs) You cops just found
evidence on him in the trash?

14:24.655 --> 14:26.991
Please. You're all
a bunch of cheaters.

14:27.074 --> 14:28.951
I need to go.

14:27.074 --> 14:28.951
Look, you were

14:29.034 --> 14:30.619
the last one to visit Pope
in prison.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.329
You two
communicated regularly.

14:32.413 --> 14:33.539
You know he was
planning a breakout?

14:33.622 --> 14:34.790
No.

14:33.622 --> 14:34.790
HICKS:
Do you know

14:34.873 --> 14:36.625
who he's
targeting next?

14:36.709 --> 14:38.669
If you do and you don't
tell us...

14:36.709 --> 14:38.669
Please.

14:38.752 --> 14:41.088
You think I'm gonna turn
on Conor after all these years?

14:41.171 --> 14:42.965
That bitch detective
couldn't turn me then,

14:43.048 --> 14:44.842
you ain't gonna turn me now.

14:44.925 --> 14:48.637
This, uh, female detective,
does she have a name?

14:44.925 --> 14:48.637
Sure.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.140
Never forget it. Lynch.

14:57.354 --> 14:59.315
You want me to call Central?
Get some of these

14:59.398 --> 15:01.191
potential targets
to other divisions?

15:02.776 --> 15:04.486
We got enough room
under our own roof.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.072
They can stay here
until Pope's brought in.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.324
What do you got here?

15:08.407 --> 15:09.658
D.A.'s case on Pope.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.327
Could give us
a lead on any targets

15:11.410 --> 15:12.828
we haven't scooped up yet.

15:12.911 --> 15:14.872
You know, I did
some digging of my own.

15:14.955 --> 15:17.333
Talked to your former colleagues
at Hollywood Division.

15:17.416 --> 15:20.127
Specifically, the Narcotics Task
Force that brought Pope down.

15:20.210 --> 15:22.338
Yeah. Some hard chargers
over there.

15:22.421 --> 15:23.505
Did you speak
with Sergeant Williams?

15:23.589 --> 15:24.882
He's still one
of my favorite people.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.508
You should try his chili.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.177
He said you wanted Pope bad.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.137
Worked the case for two
years as a detective

15:30.220 --> 15:32.681
and then left when the
task force was formed.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.058
Why was that?

15:35.100 --> 15:36.810
I was needed elsewhere.

15:36.894 --> 15:38.729
Pope wasn't the only
heavy hitter in L.A.

15:38.812 --> 15:40.397
Hmm.

15:38.812 --> 15:40.397
If that's all, Commander,

15:40.481 --> 15:42.399
I'm gonna check on something.

15:42.483 --> 15:44.568
You sure that's a good idea?

15:44.652 --> 15:46.528
I mean, you could be
on Pope's kill list, too.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.030
Oh, I don't think so.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.199
I never interacted
with him personally.

15:50.282 --> 15:52.534
You tried to flip
his girlfriend.

15:50.282 --> 15:52.534
And it didn't work.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.370
Tried a lot of things
that didn't pan out.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.664
That's why they called in
the task force.

16:01.460 --> 16:05.214
(Kowalski laughing)

16:05.297 --> 16:08.550
Long coffee break, Kowalski?

16:08.634 --> 16:11.512
Been trying your
cell all morning.

16:11.595 --> 16:12.888
Can I borrow him?

16:14.807 --> 16:17.518
You ducking me 'cause that drunk
driver paid you off last night?

16:17.601 --> 16:19.395
No, I...

16:17.601 --> 16:19.395
I don't have a lot of time.

16:19.478 --> 16:20.896
What happened to him?

16:20.979 --> 16:22.606
The division said
that he wasn't brought in.

16:24.608 --> 16:25.734
I brought him in.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.236
Everything was
by the book.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.738
We tested his blood at
the station, came back .14.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.700
Gave him his phone call,
prepped him for booking.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.702
Then this guy shows up.

16:34.785 --> 16:37.287
Really nice suit,
heavy business card.

16:37.371 --> 16:40.165
It was the kid's dad,
Logan Carter.

16:40.249 --> 16:42.042
The deputy mayor, Logan Carter?

16:42.126 --> 16:43.585
Yeah. Look,

16:43.669 --> 16:45.254
I'm just a two-year officer.

16:45.337 --> 16:46.296
But this guy's the right hand
for the mayor.

16:46.380 --> 16:47.381
I'm not losing my job for this.

16:47.464 --> 16:48.632
So he was never processed?

16:48.716 --> 16:49.925
No paperwork?

16:50.008 --> 16:51.385
The blood test?

16:50.008 --> 16:51.385
Destroyed.

16:51.468 --> 16:53.429
The dad made sure.

16:53.512 --> 16:54.930
I didn't have a choice.

16:55.013 --> 16:56.348
(phone beeps)

16:58.726 --> 17:00.477
That's my commander.
I got to go.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.563
This is not
your fault, Kowalski.

17:02.646 --> 17:03.897
But you always have a choice.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.778
HICKS:
Tan's old source paid off.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.573
He said Conor Pope
was with the Foothill Posse

17:12.656 --> 17:15.409
at this warehouse up the street
about 30 minutes ago.

17:15.492 --> 17:16.618
Do we know if he's still there?

17:16.702 --> 17:17.995
Trying to confirm.
Garment warehouse

17:18.078 --> 17:19.455
has a basement meth lab.

17:19.538 --> 17:20.372
Infrared should at least give us

17:20.456 --> 17:21.498
the number of guys
we're dealing with.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.792
Okay, I clock nine total.
One of them could be Pope.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.295
Other heat signature in
the center is a propane boiler.

17:26.378 --> 17:27.838
We can't take the
fight down there.

17:27.921 --> 17:29.757
One stray bullet could
send the whole place up.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.425
Looks like there's only one way
into the lab,

17:31.508 --> 17:32.634
a trapdoor built
into the floor.

17:32.718 --> 17:33.844
Smoke canisters
can flush them out.

17:33.927 --> 17:35.053
HICKS:
All right.
Time's short.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.806
Let's get them before the
lookout pops up for air again.

17:43.353 --> 17:44.605

Nice to see you again, Officer.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.278
Congratulations, Emerson.

19:14.361 --> 19:16.864
You used to be just
a common meth dealer,

19:16.947 --> 19:19.658
but with breaking out a
prisoner, aiding and abetting,

19:19.741 --> 19:21.869
shooting at a cop earlier,

19:21.952 --> 19:24.079
you're looking at
55 to life, pal.

19:21.952 --> 19:24.079
LUCA:
And that's before

19:24.163 --> 19:26.874
we tack on possession and intent
to manufacture crystal meth.

19:26.957 --> 19:28.375
I almost don't know
what else we can throw

19:28.458 --> 19:29.918
at you at this point, bro.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.128
How about you throw
<i>us</i> somethin?

19:31.211 --> 19:32.754
Maybe we drop the drug charges,

19:32.838 --> 19:35.799
keep you in county,
close to home.

19:35.883 --> 19:37.175
Come on.

19:37.259 --> 19:39.428
I don't know where Pope's going.

19:39.511 --> 19:42.431
He took two guys with him,
though. Reinforcements.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.266
How many targets does he have
left on his kill list?

19:44.349 --> 19:45.434
Just some woman, man.

19:45.517 --> 19:48.270
Whoever she is,
Pope blames her the most.

19:57.195 --> 19:59.573
Commander, you know who
he's talking about, right?

19:59.656 --> 20:01.783
Lieutenant Lynch. She left
by herself this morning

20:01.867 --> 20:03.827
to "check some things" and
hasn't been seen since.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.913
(phone vibrating)

20:08.373 --> 20:09.625
Yeah. Voice mail.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.168
Pope's girlfriend said
they had a history.

20:11.251 --> 20:13.295
Look, I'll check her office,
have the team put out an APB.

20:13.378 --> 20:14.630
Better hurry.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.977
Thanks for talking to us.
We've got a lieutenant

20:29.061 --> 20:30.646
off the grid
who could be in danger.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.564
And since you were Pope's
defense attorney, we're hoping

20:32.648 --> 20:35.776
you can give us some insight
on where she or Pope might be.

20:37.152 --> 20:40.113
Sure. Help yourself, Counselor.

20:40.197 --> 20:41.990
There's no snacks out there.
I'm starving.

20:42.074 --> 20:45.827
Hey, listen, I'm still bound
by attorney-client privilege.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.163
Unless you are aware of
someone in immediate danger.

20:48.246 --> 20:49.873
I don't know
about targets,

20:49.957 --> 20:51.625
but I know Pope was obsessed
with the task force

20:51.708 --> 20:52.834
that planted evidence on him.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.836
Watch your mouth.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.380
Fruit of the poisonous tree,
that ledger

20:56.463 --> 20:59.841
you found in his trash should
never have been admissible.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.343
You pressed me
for 40 minutes on the stand.

21:01.426 --> 21:02.678
I promise you I didn't plant it.

21:02.761 --> 21:03.887
Doesn't mean
someone else didn't.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.472
It ever bother you

21:05.555 --> 21:07.224
how easy that came into
your possession?

21:07.307 --> 21:08.892
We take the breaks
wherever we can get 'em.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.185
Yeah.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.185
We're not
retrying a case here.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.187
We're trying to save
someone's life.

21:12.270 --> 21:14.856
After I lost Pope's last appeal,
I thought he was gonna kill me

21:14.940 --> 21:16.149
right there in the courtroom.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.360
He's been adamant
about that damn ledger

21:18.443 --> 21:19.861
his entire time in the pen.

21:19.945 --> 21:20.988
That's what
this is about.

21:21.071 --> 21:21.947
He feels he
was wronged.

21:22.030 --> 21:23.991
And if you ask me, he was.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.325
Not that I'm excusing violence.

21:25.409 --> 21:26.326
Look,

21:26.410 --> 21:28.078
Pope wouldn't have throw
that book in the trash.

21:28.161 --> 21:30.038
So somebody else had to.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.087
Any word on Lynch?

21:35.127 --> 21:37.087
Still looking.

21:37.170 --> 21:39.506
I got a couple other divisions
trying to track her down.

21:39.589 --> 21:42.050
What's up?

21:39.589 --> 21:42.050
I know it's not a
good time right now,

21:42.134 --> 21:44.886
but I need to talk about
Deputy Mayor Carter.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.514
I'm not the political animal
like Lieutenant Lynch,

21:47.597 --> 21:50.308
but doesn't mean I don't
step foot in the jungle
every once in a while.

21:50.392 --> 21:51.893
What can you tell
me about him?

21:51.977 --> 21:54.021
Well, Carter's got
deep roots in the city,

21:54.104 --> 21:58.025
a family of public servants;
military, Congress, lawyers.

21:58.108 --> 22:02.070
He was deputy district attorney
himself a couple of decades ago.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.572
Why do you ask?

22:03.655 --> 22:05.615
I pulled over his son
for drunk driving.

22:05.699 --> 22:07.909
Carter made it disappear.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.786
(sighs)

22:09.870 --> 22:11.663
Well, what do you want
to do about it?

22:11.747 --> 22:13.290
Is there an arrest report?
Blood alcohol test?

22:13.373 --> 22:14.833
Not anymore.

22:14.916 --> 22:17.753
Well, Carter runs Public Safety.

22:17.836 --> 22:19.588
He controls the funds for

22:19.671 --> 22:21.923
the entire LAPD, top to bottom.
In a lot of ways,

22:22.007 --> 22:24.593
you could say SWAT's more at his
mercy than the mayor herself.

22:24.676 --> 22:28.221
Doesn't mean his son can drink
and drive without consequences.

22:24.676 --> 22:28.221
I agree.

22:28.305 --> 22:30.057
But right now,
there's no record of a case.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.893
You'd have to get the D.A.'s
office to open up a new inquiry

22:32.976 --> 22:34.770
based on the word of an
off-duty SWAT officer

22:34.853 --> 22:36.104
who was acting outside

22:36.188 --> 22:37.939
of her job purview,
with no physical evidence.

22:38.023 --> 22:39.775
So that's it?

22:39.858 --> 22:41.610
Just live with it?

22:41.693 --> 22:45.155
Chris, I'd never
tell you to quit.

22:45.238 --> 22:47.324
I know why this
matters to you.

22:47.407 --> 22:49.785
But you'd be fighting a battle
that's already over.

22:49.868 --> 22:52.996
Thanks for telling that
to me straight.

22:49.868 --> 22:52.996
(phone vibrates)

22:55.040 --> 22:57.501
Lynch. Where the hell are you?

23:00.712 --> 23:02.964
Lieutenant, what happened here?

23:03.048 --> 23:05.133
I found one of Pope's guys
waiting to ambush the resident,

23:05.217 --> 23:06.009
so I ambushed him first.

23:06.093 --> 23:07.260
Who lives in this house?

23:07.344 --> 23:08.762
Woman named Raquel Lopez.

23:08.845 --> 23:09.971
And how is she connected
to all this?

23:10.055 --> 23:11.264
She was an off-the-books source

23:11.348 --> 23:12.849
that provided me intel
on the Pope case.

23:12.933 --> 23:15.685
I saw her forwarding address
in the D.A.'s file,

23:15.769 --> 23:17.479
and I realized if the
D.A. knew about her,

23:17.562 --> 23:20.148
then maybe Pope did, too.
So I swung by to check on her

23:20.232 --> 23:22.150
and looks like I got
here just in time.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.318
So Raquel is his last target,
not you?

23:23.401 --> 23:25.529
She's a brave woman;
I owe her a lot.

23:25.612 --> 23:27.114
Lucky for us, Raquel
hasn't come home yet,

23:27.197 --> 23:28.281
which means she's
still out there.

23:28.365 --> 23:30.117
But Pope is trying
to track her down.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.159
Wait a second.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.911
Why didn't you tell anyone
where you were going?

23:32.994 --> 23:34.496
This was just a hunch.

23:34.579 --> 23:36.331
I didn't want to waste
valuable resources on it.

23:36.414 --> 23:38.375
All due respect, Lieutenant,
when you assessed a threat here,

23:38.458 --> 23:39.793
why didn't you call it in?

23:39.876 --> 23:42.045
I didn't want to engage
a firefight.

23:42.129 --> 23:43.505
I think
I handled myself fine.

23:43.588 --> 23:46.258
Now if you don't mind,
I have a suspect to question.

23:49.427 --> 23:52.514
Neighbors say Raquel comes
and goes for days at a time.

23:52.597 --> 23:53.974
It's normal for her
to be unreachable.

23:54.057 --> 23:55.517
So he doesn't know where she is.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.686
And he's spreading his
resources trying to find her.

23:57.769 --> 23:59.354
I recognize her.

23:59.437 --> 24:01.690
Think she went by
a different name back in 2013.

24:01.773 --> 24:04.025
Raquel was part
of Pope's crew?

24:04.109 --> 24:06.319
TAN:
Nah, she was his housekeeper.

24:06.403 --> 24:08.321
What did his housekeeper do
to make him go after her?

24:08.405 --> 24:10.157
I got one theory.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.084
He's putting up
a brick wall now,

24:21.168 --> 24:22.878
he won't give us anything
on Pope.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.838
Years of going after him
with stings and busts,

24:24.921 --> 24:26.715
Pope always got away.

24:26.798 --> 24:29.509
And then one day, everything we
needed fell right in our lap.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.553
Fell right in my lap.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.847
You know I've always
been a fan of yours.

24:33.930 --> 24:36.683
But aside from attention to
detail and thoroughness,

24:36.766 --> 24:39.436
understand luck plays a part
in a long and healthy career.

24:39.519 --> 24:41.229
Is it luck if we
made it happen?

24:41.313 --> 24:43.899
You've had a long day. Maybe you
should call and check on Bonnie.

24:43.982 --> 24:45.233
Oh, Bonnie's fine.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.735
It's the case that's
bothering me.

24:46.818 --> 24:49.613
You worked the Pope case early,
then left.

24:49.696 --> 24:51.114
But you always
wanted to get him.

24:51.198 --> 24:52.741
What information
did Raquel give you?

24:52.824 --> 24:54.659
I can't find her
in any of our files.

24:54.743 --> 24:56.244
You do know what "off the
books" means, don't you?

24:56.328 --> 24:57.287
You're not answering
my question.

24:57.370 --> 25:00.749
And you're not addressing
me like a lieutenant.

25:00.832 --> 25:03.585
What do you think
I'm hiding?

25:03.668 --> 25:07.088
I think it wasn't just luck
that I found the ledger

25:07.172 --> 25:08.423
in the trash that day.

25:08.506 --> 25:11.218
I think Raquel put it
there for me to find.

25:11.301 --> 25:13.637
And I think maybe somebody in
the LAPD told her to do it.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.764
A housekeeper throwing something
in the trash isn't a crime.

25:15.847 --> 25:18.141
It is if she did
it for the cops.

25:18.225 --> 25:21.102
In exchange for a new
name, a new life?

25:21.186 --> 25:23.271
Pope came after me,

25:23.355 --> 25:25.607
and he could've hurt
or killed my girlfriend.

25:25.690 --> 25:27.234
All 'cause he
thinks we cheated.

25:27.317 --> 25:28.944
Did we, Lieutenant?

25:29.027 --> 25:31.863
Now is not the time
to interrogate me.

25:31.947 --> 25:34.616
I need you to help me
find Raquel before Pope does.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.701
Because if we don't,
she's dead.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.001
After Pope's arrest,
Maritza Garcia changed her name

25:45.085 --> 25:46.586
to Raquel Lopez
and left the Valley.

25:46.670 --> 25:47.879
She got a nursing degree,

25:47.963 --> 25:49.798
and now rotates at five
different hospitals.

25:49.881 --> 25:52.133
HICKS:
She finished her graveyard shift

25:52.217 --> 25:54.135
at Saint Thomas
at 6:30 this morning.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.638
Hasn't been seen since.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.638
I couldn't get Pope's
guy to say much,

25:56.721 --> 25:58.974
but one thing is clear:
Pope is still hunting for her.

25:59.057 --> 26:01.351
You don't have any other
information on her you
want to share with us?

26:01.434 --> 26:03.019
DEACON:
Made some calls.

26:03.103 --> 26:05.230
Raquel wasn't scheduled to work
at any other hospital today.

26:05.313 --> 26:08.024
But look at this. Pope's
been making the rounds,

26:08.108 --> 26:09.985
each of the hospitals she
works, asking about her.

26:10.068 --> 26:10.819
Now, this time stamp

26:10.902 --> 26:12.821
shows that he just
left the last one.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.489
HICKS:
How's he getting
his information?

26:14.572 --> 26:16.199
She changed her name,
was off the books,

26:16.283 --> 26:18.827
yet he's got the addresses
to every single hospital

26:18.910 --> 26:20.829
she works at?

26:18.910 --> 26:20.829
Yeah, I've been wondering
the same thing, too.

26:20.912 --> 26:22.330
And not just for Raquel.

26:22.414 --> 26:25.000
Pope managed to locate
a state's witness,

26:25.083 --> 26:27.460
a city prosecutor
and a SWAT officer.

26:27.544 --> 26:29.754
None of their information
is public record.

26:29.838 --> 26:32.841
He needed subpoenaed documents
and access to our files.

26:32.924 --> 26:35.343
Which means you think we have
a leak in the D.A.'s office?

26:35.427 --> 26:37.220
Well, it's hard to imagine Pope
got to someone there.

26:37.304 --> 26:38.805
What about the other side?

26:38.888 --> 26:40.682
Defense attorneys have access
to everything, too.

26:40.765 --> 26:42.225
Pope's lawyer worked nonstop
on his appeals

26:42.309 --> 26:43.310
the last seven years.

26:43.393 --> 26:45.520
Bring his ass into
interrogation.

26:45.603 --> 26:47.022
Now.

26:49.107 --> 26:50.692
Hicks filled me in
on your DUI bust.

26:50.775 --> 26:52.235
Wanted me to check in.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.029
He thinks it'd be
smart to drop it.

26:54.112 --> 26:56.531
(chuckles)
He knew you wouldn't.

26:56.614 --> 26:58.533
You dig anything else up?

26:58.616 --> 27:00.368
The deputy mayor's son
just graduated college.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.370
I asked departments
by the school.

27:02.454 --> 27:03.747
Friends of mine
found two other times

27:03.830 --> 27:06.082
in the last year where Jacob
got pulled over

27:06.166 --> 27:07.917
and the deputy mayor
made them all go away.

27:08.001 --> 27:09.711
So this wasn't the first time
Jacob's used his daddy's

27:09.794 --> 27:11.171
"get out of jail free" card.

27:11.254 --> 27:12.589
He's gonna continue
driving drunk

27:12.672 --> 27:14.758
until he hurts himself
or someone else.

27:14.841 --> 27:16.718
(sighs)

27:16.801 --> 27:19.012
Do you know how
my mom died, Hondo?

27:19.095 --> 27:21.222
Only the broad details.

27:21.306 --> 27:22.974
Never felt right to pry.

27:24.184 --> 27:25.852
It was a pileup on the freeway.

27:25.935 --> 27:27.896
My mom caused it trying to make
a last-minute exit

27:27.979 --> 27:29.898
across three lanes.

27:29.981 --> 27:32.776
Four dead, including her.

27:32.859 --> 27:34.444
She was drunk at the time.

27:34.527 --> 27:36.571
She usually was.

27:36.654 --> 27:38.865
It didn't matter
how much she drank,

27:38.948 --> 27:40.867
she always thought
she was in control.

27:40.950 --> 27:44.954
And she always got away with it,
until she didn't.

27:45.038 --> 27:47.874
You know what you need to do.

27:49.709 --> 27:52.170
Of course I do.

27:52.253 --> 27:54.422
But Hicks is right.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.883
Carter's reach is huge.

27:56.966 --> 27:58.760
He can punish all of SWAT
to get to me.

27:58.843 --> 28:00.887
City Hall's never scared us,
Chris.

28:00.970 --> 28:02.347
I don't want anything
to happen to the team

28:02.430 --> 28:03.807
because of some
personal crusade.

28:03.890 --> 28:06.768
You are talking about
saving lives.

28:06.851 --> 28:08.478
That's personal to all of us.

28:08.561 --> 28:11.398
Now, only you can decide
how far you push this.

28:11.481 --> 28:13.775
But when I'm in a tough spot,
I just ask myself:

28:13.858 --> 28:15.944
what is the right thing to do?

28:16.027 --> 28:18.071
And you know that answer.

28:21.950 --> 28:23.743
HICKS:
<i>D.A. showed us your requests</i>

28:23.827 --> 28:26.496
for personal information leading
to all of Pope's victims.

28:26.579 --> 28:28.540
Before you say it was for his
appeal, your requests came

28:28.623 --> 28:30.125
after his last one was denied.

28:30.208 --> 28:31.543
And we checked with your firm.

28:31.626 --> 28:33.294
If you were still doing
legal work for Conor Pope,

28:33.378 --> 28:34.421
it wasn't on their time.

28:34.504 --> 28:36.756
You're gonna be arrested
for abetting Pope in murder

28:36.840 --> 28:38.299
the moment you leave this room.

28:38.383 --> 28:40.135
He's got to have some kind
of leverage on you.

28:40.218 --> 28:44.347
Come on, man, this is where
you defend yourself.

28:44.431 --> 28:47.308
He was gonna murder my family.

28:47.392 --> 28:48.810
The only way I could

28:48.893 --> 28:51.479
stay off that kill list was
to help him make it.

28:51.563 --> 28:52.647
All I did was my job.

28:52.730 --> 28:55.525
You're the ones who started this
by planting evidence.

28:55.608 --> 28:58.111
HICKS:
We don't have time
for a whole deposition.

28:58.194 --> 29:00.530
Pope's already been to
every hospital Raquel works at.

29:00.613 --> 29:01.865
Where's he looking next?

29:01.948 --> 29:03.825
LYNCH:
Raquel is innocent.

29:03.908 --> 29:05.702
None of us want her to die.

29:05.785 --> 29:10.707
Raquel's cousin is a patient
at a rehab clinic in Malibu.

29:10.790 --> 29:12.667
Sometimes Raquel
volunteers there.

29:12.750 --> 29:14.127
He left the last hospital
20 minutes ago.

29:14.210 --> 29:16.004
He's already ahead of us.
I'll tell Hondo.

29:20.049 --> 29:21.009
Yeah, maybe

29:21.092 --> 29:23.511
if you had played by the
rules in the first place,

29:23.595 --> 29:25.346
this wouldn't have happened.

29:29.601 --> 29:32.687
Rehab facility's off-grid
and they got a "no phones" rule.

29:32.770 --> 29:34.522
So we can't get through to them
or warn Raquel.

29:34.606 --> 29:35.857
Trying to save the addicts
from themselves--

29:35.940 --> 29:37.734
now it's putting them
in more danger.

29:37.817 --> 29:39.027
Trying to make the best time
I can.

29:40.487 --> 29:42.906
HONDO:
Tan, what's your problem?

29:42.989 --> 29:44.324
Spit it out.

29:44.407 --> 29:46.367
You know me,
I don't talk out of school,

29:46.451 --> 29:48.912
but I think Lynch got Raquel
to toss Pope's ledger

29:48.995 --> 29:51.039
seven years ago,
knowing that I would find it.

29:51.122 --> 29:52.332
STREET:
She got a source
to collect evidence.

29:52.415 --> 29:53.875
That's part of the job.

29:53.958 --> 29:55.043
Not if she told Raquel
to throw the book away

29:55.126 --> 29:57.253
so the police could find it.
That's planting evidence.

29:57.337 --> 29:59.672
There are rules.

29:57.337 --> 29:59.672
And we have to play by them.

29:59.756 --> 30:01.090
For all we know,
Raquel did it willingly.

30:01.174 --> 30:02.759
DEACON:
Everything comes down
to chain of custody--

30:02.842 --> 30:04.344
tough to prove anything
illegal was done,

30:04.427 --> 30:06.513
but Lynch is smart,
she knows that.

30:06.596 --> 30:08.056
Doesn't matter. Lynch was
a mentor, we have history.

30:08.139 --> 30:10.058
I can live with the past,
but can I trust her now?

30:10.141 --> 30:11.726
HONDO:
She's ain't going
into battle with us.

30:11.809 --> 30:13.937
Now this team, we've always
had each other's backs.

30:14.020 --> 30:15.563
And right now,
we got a life to save.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.565
So we're gonna get this one done
like the others--

30:17.649 --> 30:18.900
the way we trained.

30:18.983 --> 30:21.986
(siren wailing)

30:28.117 --> 30:30.078
Split up. Find Raquel!

30:39.128 --> 30:40.755
Deacon, Tan, locate Raquel,
get her safe.

30:40.838 --> 30:42.757
Street and Chris,
you're with me.

30:42.840 --> 30:44.842
♪ ♪

30:51.182 --> 30:52.934
Where are the patients'
quarters?

30:51.182 --> 30:52.934
Oh, oh, my God.

30:53.017 --> 30:54.602
Please don't shoot me.

30:53.017 --> 30:54.602
Where?

30:54.686 --> 30:55.812
Uh, second floor.
That way.

30:58.898 --> 31:00.858
(alarm blaring)

31:03.736 --> 31:04.529
Where's the gunman?

31:04.612 --> 31:05.905
Where's the gunman?!

31:04.612 --> 31:05.905
He went that way.

31:05.989 --> 31:07.448
STREET:
It's okay. LAPD!

31:07.532 --> 31:08.825
Exit the building!

31:08.908 --> 31:10.243
Fire alarm is gonna
draw people out.

31:10.326 --> 31:11.452
Pope's trying to
bring Raquel to him.

31:11.536 --> 31:13.204
We're running out of time.

31:16.916 --> 31:17.959
Maritza?

31:20.253 --> 31:22.839
(gasping)

31:20.253 --> 31:22.839
This is not a drill!

31:27.385 --> 31:29.429
Move, move, move, move!

31:27.385 --> 31:29.429
Come on, come on, go.

31:29.512 --> 31:31.264
He went that way!

31:29.512 --> 31:31.264
We're looking for Raquel Lopez.

31:31.347 --> 31:33.391
She's got a cousin here.

31:31.347 --> 31:33.391
Yeah, Sadie Brown--
second floor,

31:33.474 --> 31:35.768
down the hall.

31:33.474 --> 31:35.768
Move, move, move,
move, move, move!

31:36.894 --> 31:38.187
Let's go.

31:38.271 --> 31:39.814
It's just another drill, Raquel.

31:39.897 --> 31:41.024
I don't think so.

31:41.107 --> 31:42.859
I don't want to go.

31:42.942 --> 31:46.487
Something's wrong.

31:46.571 --> 31:48.072
STREET: On the ground! LAPD!

31:46.571 --> 31:48.072
Down, down, down!

31:49.741 --> 31:51.242
CHRIS:
Don't move!

31:51.326 --> 31:52.493
Down!

31:51.326 --> 31:52.493
Now! On the ground now!

31:52.577 --> 31:53.494

Hands behind your back!

31:53.578 --> 31:55.204
Hands behind your back!

31:57.749 --> 32:00.543
26-David, one suspect

32:01.586 --> 32:03.296
Move or die! Move!

32:03.379 --> 32:04.631
(people screaming)

32:07.425 --> 32:08.676
Pope, put the gun down!

32:08.760 --> 32:10.053
Hands behind your head!

32:13.097 --> 32:14.057
Get back in the room!

32:19.604 --> 32:21.105
(grunting)

32:35.286 --> 32:36.204
Conor Pope,

32:36.287 --> 32:38.539
you're under arrest.

32:38.623 --> 32:39.707
You take a good
look at this man.

32:41.668 --> 32:44.420
He put you away the first time,
I'm gonna put you away the last.

32:44.504 --> 32:46.214
LYNCH:
<i>I called the mayor,</i>

32:46.297 --> 32:48.007
told her Conor Pope
is in custody.

32:48.091 --> 32:50.760
She sends her appreciation.

32:48.091 --> 32:50.760
Ah.

32:50.843 --> 32:53.221
We've had a long year so
far together, Lieutenant,

32:53.304 --> 32:55.515
and I'd like to think
we've gotten closer,

32:55.598 --> 32:58.393
so I'm only gonna
ask this once.

32:58.476 --> 33:00.728
Did you leverage Raquel Lopez
to illegally obtain evidence

33:00.812 --> 33:02.855
for the LAPD seven years ago?

33:02.939 --> 33:04.524
No, I didn't.

33:04.607 --> 33:06.234
Just tell us the truth, please.

33:06.317 --> 33:07.276
I am.

33:07.360 --> 33:08.778
So that's how
it's gonna be?

33:08.861 --> 33:10.571
Because this unit

33:10.655 --> 33:12.573
can't function without
trust, Lieutenant.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.659
Then trust me.

33:31.676 --> 33:33.594
We got Pope.

33:33.678 --> 33:36.013
He's never coming near us again.

33:37.223 --> 33:38.433
We should talk about earlier.

33:38.516 --> 33:40.935
What you saw today,
we train for that,

33:41.018 --> 33:42.478
but that's not
how the job is, usually.

33:42.562 --> 33:44.105
You're in harm's way every day.

33:44.188 --> 33:46.107
You need to fend for yourself.
I get that.

33:46.190 --> 33:48.359
Yeah. Instincts kick in
when it's life or death,

33:48.443 --> 33:52.280
and I know
it looked brutal, but...

33:52.363 --> 33:55.283
I just hope you don't
look at me differently.

33:55.366 --> 33:57.118
Victor, I knew you were SWAT,

33:57.201 --> 34:00.288
but I didn't know
you could do that.

34:00.371 --> 34:02.457
(laughs)

34:02.540 --> 34:04.375
You were amazing.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.462
Wait.

34:07.545 --> 34:10.047
I thought you were freaked out,
in shock.

34:10.131 --> 34:13.134
It-it was shocking,
but the good kind,

34:13.217 --> 34:14.635
maybe?

34:14.719 --> 34:17.638
It takes so much
every morning

34:17.722 --> 34:19.640
when I kiss you goodbye
to not think

34:19.724 --> 34:22.268
that's the last time
I might see you.

34:22.351 --> 34:25.772
I know you've got a
dangerous job, but...

34:25.855 --> 34:31.611
seeing you in action,
watching you save lives today?

34:31.694 --> 34:33.613
If you can handle that,
you can handle anything

34:33.696 --> 34:35.281
that life throws at us.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.619
Wow, um...

34:39.702 --> 34:41.621
What?

34:41.704 --> 34:43.664
I had this whole plan today.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.541
Yeah, it was gonna be
really special.

34:49.754 --> 34:53.174
To hell with it. I-I know this
isn't the most romantic place,

34:53.257 --> 34:57.428
but... you make me so happy.

34:59.096 --> 35:01.557
(laughs)

34:59.096 --> 35:01.557
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.603
Bonnie Lonsdale...

35:06.896 --> 35:08.356
...will you marry me?

35:08.439 --> 35:11.484
(laughs):
Hell yeah, of course I will.

35:12.777 --> 35:14.695
(applause)

35:14.779 --> 35:16.197
OFFICER:
Victor Tan for the win!

35:17.615 --> 35:19.575
STREET:
Tan!

35:19.659 --> 35:22.870
Good news.
I think I know where that, uh...

35:22.954 --> 35:25.540
evidence you were
looking for is-- Hi, Bonnie.

35:25.623 --> 35:26.833
Hi.

35:25.623 --> 35:26.833
The bad news is,

35:26.916 --> 35:28.584
I'm pretty sure
it's at the city dump.

35:28.668 --> 35:30.878
Turns out, one of the
M.E.s pocketed it

35:30.962 --> 35:33.214
after the shooting,
and then forgot.

35:33.297 --> 35:34.715
He left it in
his hazmat suit.

35:34.799 --> 35:35.842
All that stuff gets disposed of

35:35.925 --> 35:37.343
as biowaste
at the end of the day.

35:37.426 --> 35:38.928
I know a guy who can pull
the trash for us, but we got

35:39.011 --> 35:40.179
to leave right now
before they close.

35:40.263 --> 35:41.848
Hey, hey. It's okay.

35:41.931 --> 35:44.559
I don't need it.

35:44.642 --> 35:46.227
I already said yes.

35:46.310 --> 35:48.729
You said yes? She said yes!

35:48.813 --> 35:50.898
(laughs):
Hey, that's amazing.

35:48.813 --> 35:50.898
Thanks.

35:50.982 --> 35:52.900
You're getting married.

35:50.982 --> 35:52.900
Hey. Ah...

35:52.984 --> 35:55.069
Sorry you went through
so much trouble, but, uh,

35:55.152 --> 35:56.571
I'm gonna get her a new ring.

35:56.654 --> 36:00.032
One that doesn't remind us
of the day we almost died.

36:00.116 --> 36:02.618
Wait, wait, wait. Y-You're gonna
leave a perfectly good ring

36:02.702 --> 36:03.578
at the city dump?

36:03.661 --> 36:05.705
Nothing stopping you
from digging it up, Jim.

36:05.788 --> 36:07.582
Maybe you'll need it one day.

36:13.212 --> 36:14.755
PRONGER:
Christina.

36:14.839 --> 36:16.591
Welcome to City Hall.

36:16.674 --> 36:18.092
Have we met?

36:16.674 --> 36:18.092
I know

36:18.175 --> 36:19.802
who you are, Officer Alonso.

36:19.886 --> 36:21.762
I also know
you're an exemplary cop

36:21.846 --> 36:23.806
with a long, decorated history.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.433
You work for the deputy mayor.

36:25.516 --> 36:27.059
We just want to know how
we can agree on things.

36:27.143 --> 36:28.311
You're coming up

36:28.394 --> 36:29.604
on your five-year.

36:29.687 --> 36:31.772
Good optics
for a deserved promotion.

36:31.856 --> 36:33.274
You know what I want?

36:33.357 --> 36:34.942
I want your boss's son
to start following the law

36:35.026 --> 36:36.360
and get the help he needs.

36:37.653 --> 36:39.113
The D.A. won't touch this.

36:39.196 --> 36:41.699
You've got no case.

36:41.782 --> 36:43.659
Now, you're kicking up
a hornet's nest for nothing.

36:43.743 --> 36:46.621
Nothing, except a
lot of misery for you

36:46.704 --> 36:49.290
and your friends at SWAT.

36:51.876 --> 36:53.586
There may be no record
of a blood test,

36:53.669 --> 36:56.130
but there was still an EMT
who had to administer it.

36:56.213 --> 36:58.132
He had no problem signing
an affidavit swearing

36:58.215 --> 36:59.967
he drew Jacob Carter's
blood last night.

37:00.051 --> 37:03.304
I bet the D.A. will be curious
why the results are missing.

37:03.387 --> 37:05.640
Along with my testimony,
Jacob will face the consequences

37:05.723 --> 37:07.350
for his actions.

37:07.433 --> 37:09.602
You do what you have to do.
I'll do the same.

37:09.685 --> 37:11.771
Hey, Officer Alonso.

37:14.231 --> 37:16.400
You have a good day now.

37:18.945 --> 37:21.155
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

37:21.239 --> 37:22.448
(insects chirping)

37:22.531 --> 37:24.241
Oh, Lieutenant.

37:24.325 --> 37:25.993
Come in.

37:26.077 --> 37:28.162
Wanted to see how you were
holding up after today.

37:30.122 --> 37:31.624
You didn't have to.

37:31.707 --> 37:33.209
I got something on the stove.

37:33.292 --> 37:34.835
The police asked me
a lot of questions

37:34.919 --> 37:36.545
about seven years ago.

37:37.797 --> 37:39.840
Pope's first arrest.

37:39.924 --> 37:41.842
I didn't say anything
about our arrangement.

37:41.926 --> 37:44.136
I'm sorry you had
to go through that,

37:44.220 --> 37:46.847
but you didn't have
to protect me.

37:44.220 --> 37:46.847
Sure I did.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.849
I owe you for saving my life.

37:48.933 --> 37:50.851
If you came forward
with evidence publicly,

37:50.935 --> 37:52.812
you would've been
the prosecution's star witness.

37:52.895 --> 37:54.814
All Pope would need
to stay out of jail

37:54.897 --> 37:56.649
was to find a way
to silence you.

37:57.775 --> 38:00.027
Did you explain that
to your team?

38:01.487 --> 38:02.697
They don't have the burden
of living

38:02.780 --> 38:05.574
in the gray areas
like I have to.

38:02.780 --> 38:05.574
Hmm.

38:05.658 --> 38:07.952
It's a price I'm willing to pay.

38:09.286 --> 38:10.705
NICHELLE:
Hi.

38:10.788 --> 38:13.207
(laughs): Come on in. Hey.

38:10.788 --> 38:13.207
Hey.

38:13.290 --> 38:16.836
(gasps)
Girl, you look amazing.

38:16.919 --> 38:18.212
Hondo just got home.

38:18.295 --> 38:20.047
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

38:18.295 --> 38:20.047
Oh...

38:20.131 --> 38:22.758
I didn't hear from Hondo, so
I thought you left town already.

38:22.842 --> 38:24.051
Well...

38:22.842 --> 38:24.051
HONDO:
Wow.

38:25.428 --> 38:27.013
(chuckles)

38:27.096 --> 38:29.015
You look like a movie star.

38:29.098 --> 38:30.558
You're not dressed yet.

38:30.641 --> 38:32.143
I know, I'm-I'm sorry.

38:32.226 --> 38:33.894
I... I just got home.

38:33.978 --> 38:37.023
Yeah, well, I'm gonna leave
you two, give you a minute.

38:40.276 --> 38:43.904
Baby, it was a rough day.

38:43.988 --> 38:45.740
I'm not gonna be able
to make it tonight.

38:45.823 --> 38:47.575
Look, I'm sorry, but
I just don't know

38:47.658 --> 38:50.077
if I got it in me for small talk
and appetizers right now.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.246
This is important, Hondo.

38:52.329 --> 38:53.581
I know. No, I know.

38:53.664 --> 38:55.249
And that's why you should go.

38:55.332 --> 38:56.751
Enjoy yourself, you earned this.

38:56.834 --> 38:59.754
You were the one
who brought this together.

38:59.837 --> 39:01.338
What happened at work?

39:04.133 --> 39:06.761
Nichelle, sometimes in this job,
you just got certain days,

39:06.844 --> 39:10.598
and... today was a day.

39:10.681 --> 39:12.725
But your friends are gonna
be there, and-and your folks.

39:12.808 --> 39:13.934
You don't need me.

39:14.018 --> 39:15.102
My folks.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.896
So, that's what this is about?

39:16.979 --> 39:19.398
'Cause you didn't know
my parents were coming?

39:16.979 --> 39:19.398
Nichelle,

39:19.482 --> 39:21.734
sometimes I'm not gonna be able
to make it to things.

39:21.817 --> 39:23.611
I mean, if you want to
date a SWAT officer,

39:23.694 --> 39:26.030
I mean, that's just
the way it's got to be.

39:27.865 --> 39:30.201
Sure. I understand.

39:45.883 --> 39:49.428
You're my brother,
and I love you.

39:49.512 --> 39:51.722
What the damn hell
is wrong with you?

39:51.806 --> 39:53.307
Are you trying to blow
things up with her?

39:53.390 --> 39:54.975
(stammers)
Winnie, just stop.

39:55.059 --> 39:56.143
You don't know
what you're talking about.

39:56.227 --> 39:58.813
Let me guess. Nichelle
met your family,

39:58.896 --> 40:00.815
tried to get you to meet hers.

40:00.898 --> 40:02.983
The relationship got real
and you got spooked.

40:03.067 --> 40:04.985
Okay, you know what?
I ain't got to listen to this

40:05.069 --> 40:06.946
from the sister I hear from
once every few months,

40:07.029 --> 40:08.447
who's got two divorces
on her record.

40:08.531 --> 40:09.949
You know...

40:10.032 --> 40:11.992
You have been doing this
your whole life, Hondo.

40:12.076 --> 40:13.828
I don't even think you want
anything serious.

40:13.911 --> 40:15.830
Oh, what? Y-You want
me to be like you?

40:15.913 --> 40:17.998
You jump from one wrong guy
to the next.

40:18.082 --> 40:20.084
Why'd you leave
your second husband again?

40:21.961 --> 40:24.672
You watch yourself, Hondo.

40:24.755 --> 40:27.216
I live my life the way
I need to live it to be happy.

40:27.299 --> 40:30.469
Long as you're the one doing
the leaving, you're happy.

40:30.553 --> 40:33.013
Anything to not be
blindsided like Mom.

40:33.097 --> 40:34.181
And just 'cause you don't
marry them before you

40:34.265 --> 40:36.350
break their hearts doesn't
make you any less like Dad.

40:36.433 --> 40:38.519
I am nothing like that man!

40:38.602 --> 40:39.895
Well, you tell that
to the amazing woman

40:39.979 --> 40:41.689
you just pushed out the door.

40:50.239 --> 40:52.241
Winnie...

40:53.284 --> 40:58.038
Winnie, the-the truth is,

40:58.122 --> 41:00.291
I've been thinking a lot
about them, Mom and Pop.

41:00.374 --> 41:04.003
They have been spending
more and more time together.

41:04.086 --> 41:05.045
They're taking walks,

41:05.129 --> 41:08.132
they're getting meals.

41:08.215 --> 41:10.551
I overheard them talking
about a Palm Springs visit.

41:10.634 --> 41:13.888
Lord have mercy.

41:10.634 --> 41:13.888
Yeah.

41:13.971 --> 41:15.890
I don't think it hurts

41:15.973 --> 41:19.768
because they're spending
more time together.

41:19.852 --> 41:23.731
It hurts because
he's so damn happy.

41:23.814 --> 41:26.692
I mean, I ain't gonna lie
to you, there is a part of me

41:26.775 --> 41:29.904
that wants him to still hurt,
you know?

41:29.987 --> 41:33.699
We can't keep holding
on to that, Hondo.

41:33.782 --> 41:37.286
I mean,
I'm-I'm just as guilty.

41:39.872 --> 41:42.917
We spent so much time

41:43.000 --> 41:44.919
running away
from our parents' example

41:45.002 --> 41:48.297
that we s-screwed ourselves up
in our own ways.

41:51.842 --> 41:56.764
Maybe it's-it's time
for that to end.

41:56.847 --> 41:58.599
'Cause I got
to tell you, this...

41:58.682 --> 42:02.102
Nichelle seems
like a real winner.

42:06.523 --> 42:07.942
(voice breaking):
She is.
