00:04.533 --> 00:07.133
Erica: Welcome home,
baby.

00:07.133 --> 00:09.266
Ugh!
What is in here?

00:10.266 --> 00:11.300
(slaps Ethan,
Ethan laughs)

00:11.300 --> 00:12.300
What?

00:15.500 --> 00:16.500
(muffled question)

00:16.500 --> 00:17.500
Oh, okay. yeah.

00:17.500 --> 00:19.033
Erica:
High five.

00:21.566 --> 00:22.566
(grunts)

00:25.166 --> 00:26.600
No way.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.500
Ethan, you cannot
put that there.

00:28.500 --> 00:31.200
What're you talking about?
Why can't I?

00:31.200 --> 00:32.200
Because--

00:32.200 --> 00:33.333
"Why can't I?"

00:33.333 --> 00:35.700
It's a question
that never goes away.

00:35.700 --> 00:38.366
Our whole lives are spent
chafing against the rules,

00:38.366 --> 00:39.366
pushing back the boundaries,

00:39.366 --> 00:40.566
trying to find a loophole.

00:40.566 --> 00:42.200
Oh, come on,
the beanbag chair,

00:42.200 --> 00:44.200
it's way too big
for the living room.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.600
It's old
and it's falling apart--

00:45.600 --> 00:47.200
Ethan:
It doesn't match the couch.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.100
Judith:
"Mine" becomes "ours"

00:49.100 --> 00:51.266
the second you cohabitate.

00:51.266 --> 00:53.000
Learn to love
the beanbag.

00:53.000 --> 00:55.033
Thank you, Kai,
that's very helpful.

00:56.166 --> 00:56.766
Dave: Thank you.

00:56.766 --> 00:57.766
(patrons applaud)

00:57.766 --> 01:00.033
Thank you for
showing the love.

01:00.033 --> 01:04.133
And now, here to charm you
with his dulcet tones,

01:04.133 --> 01:07.100
goblins' own,
Kai Booker.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.066
Patron:
Wooo-ooo!

01:08.066 --> 01:09.100
(smattering of applause)

01:10.100 --> 01:11.500
What're you doing?
I told you.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.066
Come on.
Come on, everybody.

01:13.066 --> 01:14.133
(patrons applaud)

01:14.133 --> 01:15.100
Erica: Woo! Yeah!

01:15.100 --> 01:17.466
Dave:
Right on, right on.

01:20.666 --> 01:22.500
Wow! Did you know
he could sing?

01:22.500 --> 01:23.733
No.

01:23.733 --> 01:24.733
(clears throat)

01:26.200 --> 01:27.233

02:43.100 --> 02:45.066
Well, cheers.

02:45.066 --> 02:46.133
(glasses clink)

02:47.533 --> 02:50.133
I have to
get some air.

02:50.633 --> 02:53.300
I'm just gonna tell Kai
how amazing he was, okay?

02:53.300 --> 02:54.500
I'll be right back.

02:54.500 --> 02:55.500
Oh. okay.

03:02.500 --> 03:03.500
So--

03:05.233 --> 03:06.633
You can sing.

03:09.266 --> 03:10.466
You sing really well.

03:10.466 --> 03:11.433
Kai: Thank you.

03:11.433 --> 03:12.566
Erica: Kai,
it was incredible.

03:12.566 --> 03:14.566
Why didn't you tell me
you're a musician?

03:14.566 --> 03:16.033
Are you in a band?

03:16.033 --> 03:19.700
You know, a barista by day,
rock star by night?

03:21.100 --> 03:22.266
(laughs)

03:22.266 --> 03:24.233
Okay, we can't
talk about therapy,

03:24.233 --> 03:25.700
singing is
a non-starter.

03:25.700 --> 03:28.000
Uh, what can
we talk about?

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Latte art?

03:30.566 --> 03:32.200
Fine, what do you
wanna know?

03:33.600 --> 03:35.766
Anthony: --you start off
with the orange veggies.

03:35.766 --> 03:38.766
You know, like squash,
carrots, sweet potato,

03:38.766 --> 03:40.566
stuff like that.
It's like a system.

03:40.566 --> 03:41.600
Great.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.600
Hey, do you want me
to go get her?

03:43.600 --> 03:46.000
Oh, um, no.
No, it's okay.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.466
She'll be back soon.

03:47.466 --> 03:50.166
What is the big deal about you
telling me your doctor's name?

03:50.166 --> 03:52.366
There is no big deal,
I just don't wanna.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.733
Oh my god,
you are so annoying.

03:54.733 --> 03:56.300
Ha.

03:56.300 --> 04:00.333
Well, my 15 minutes
has turned into 20.

04:00.333 --> 04:01.700
I gotta
get back to work.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.166
Erica: Of course
you do.

04:03.166 --> 04:04.633
Honestly,
I don't understand

04:04.633 --> 04:07.233
why everything has to be
such a secret with you?

04:09.533 --> 04:11.200
Erica: Hey, guys,
what'd I miss?

04:11.200 --> 04:13.766
Ethan: The entire evening,
apparently.

04:13.766 --> 04:16.233
Judith: Um, how about
we go settle the bill?

04:16.233 --> 04:18.200
Anthony: Yeah.
Yeah, okay.

04:19.533 --> 04:20.500
You're mad.

04:20.500 --> 04:21.700
You were gone
for 20 minutes.

04:21.700 --> 04:23.700
So? I was just talking
to a friend.

04:23.700 --> 04:27.366
Oh, you mean, Kai,
the 22-year-old barista?

04:27.366 --> 04:28.366
Okay, wait a minute,

04:28.366 --> 04:30.166
are you mad
because I was awol,

04:30.166 --> 04:32.766
or because
I was talking to kai?

04:32.766 --> 04:35.166
Well, Ethan,
what do you want me to do,

04:35.166 --> 04:37.333
just not be his friend?

04:37.333 --> 04:39.533
That'd be a good start.

04:47.266 --> 04:50.533
Erica: Over and over we resist
any attempt to box us in,

04:50.533 --> 04:52.266
to curtail our freedom.

04:52.266 --> 04:56.200
We ask the question,
"why can't i?"

04:56.200 --> 04:58.300
And when the answer
comes back,

04:58.300 --> 05:00.500
we never
like what we hear.

05:01.500 --> 05:11.300
♪

05:11.300 --> 05:14.233
♪ It's clearer inside of me ♪

05:14.233 --> 05:16.366

05:58.466 --> 05:59.466
(sighs)

06:01.366 --> 06:03.033
I almost broke my neck.

06:03.033 --> 06:04.166
Ethan:
What?

06:04.166 --> 06:06.333
Your beanbag chair,
it attacked me.

06:06.333 --> 06:08.700
Why is it in the middle
of the bedroom?

06:08.700 --> 06:12.333
Ethan: Uh, 'cause it's not
in the living room.

06:12.333 --> 06:13.566
Hey.

06:13.566 --> 06:15.466
Oh, you look tired.

06:16.466 --> 06:18.066
Thanks. I am.

06:20.400 --> 06:21.400
Kinda hard to sleep

06:21.400 --> 06:23.200
When your boyfriend
is mad at you.

06:24.466 --> 06:25.666
Okay, here's
the thing, I--

06:25.666 --> 06:27.466
I don't get your
friendship with Kai.

06:27.466 --> 06:28.600
People in relationships--

06:28.600 --> 06:30.100
Erica: What,
they can't be trusted

06:30.100 --> 06:32.066
to be friends with someone
from the opposite sex?

06:32.066 --> 06:34.066
Ethan: Look, get your
morning coffee from him,

06:34.066 --> 06:36.066
talk to him
while you're waiting in line,

06:36.066 --> 06:37.466
that's cool,
but anything else and--

06:37.466 --> 06:40.166
Erica: Ethan,
I'm not Claire.

06:40.166 --> 06:43.000
Exactly, because Claire would
pull that kind of shit on me

06:43.000 --> 06:44.066
all the time.

06:47.333 --> 06:48.333
Fine.

06:49.433 --> 06:50.766
Thank you.

06:55.700 --> 06:58.500
Erica: He didn't actually say
"you can't be friends with Kai,"

06:58.500 --> 07:00.133
but clearly
what he meant was--

07:00.133 --> 07:02.300
You can't be friends
with Kai.

07:02.300 --> 07:05.233
But why?!
I mean, it's crazy.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.633
Is she from
your mom's group?

07:11.633 --> 07:13.766
No, no, I just see her
around sometimes

07:13.766 --> 07:16.566
and her kid looks about
the same age as Max, so.

07:16.566 --> 07:18.166
Well, you should go
introduce yourself.

07:18.166 --> 07:19.766
You can swap,
I don't know,

07:19.766 --> 07:21.300
sleeping pills
or notes,

07:21.300 --> 07:22.700
or whatever
you new moms do.

07:22.700 --> 07:24.366
I don't even know
her name.

07:24.366 --> 07:26.400
Really?
I can fix that.

07:26.400 --> 07:27.566
Oh, Erica, no!

07:27.566 --> 07:29.466
No, no,
that's Weird.

07:29.466 --> 07:32.300
Wow, you sound
like Ethan.

07:33.300 --> 07:34.366
He's threatened,

07:34.366 --> 07:36.000
and probably just
a little bit jealous,

07:36.000 --> 07:37.133
that's all.

07:37.133 --> 07:38.666
But why? I haven't done
anything wrong.

07:38.666 --> 07:40.400
Judith, Kai...

07:40.400 --> 07:42.200
Kai is just a friend.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.733
I know, but it's--

07:44.166 --> 07:46.366
It's just one of those things
you can't do.

07:46.366 --> 07:47.333
Oh, come on.

07:47.333 --> 07:49.000
I was friends with Ethan
for years

07:49.000 --> 07:50.400
when he was married
to Claire.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.433
Exactly.

07:51.433 --> 07:54.066
And who's
Ethan with now?

07:54.066 --> 07:56.100
So are we going
to goblins or what?

07:56.100 --> 07:58.766
Actually,
I feel like a Starbucks.

07:58.766 --> 07:59.766
(laughs)

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
all right.

08:03.333 --> 08:05.333
Erica: So that is the resume
of Nicole Clarkson.

08:05.333 --> 08:07.766
She has her masters in
couples and family therapy

08:07.766 --> 08:09.266
from the University
of Guelph.

08:09.266 --> 08:12.566
And I read this fascinating
article that she wrote

08:12.566 --> 08:15.400
about how sex has gone
from a physical act

08:15.400 --> 08:16.400
to a legal one.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.000
Bah!

08:18.000 --> 08:20.533
I'm bored,
where are we on titles?

08:20.533 --> 08:22.633
Um, okay,
just spit-balling,

08:22.633 --> 08:24.400
but I do have a few.

08:25.400 --> 08:26.700
"let's talk about sex."

08:28.466 --> 08:29.700
(singing quietly)
♪ Baby... ♪

08:29.700 --> 08:32.166
'cause... um...

08:32.166 --> 08:33.166
"hot under the collar."

08:35.466 --> 08:36.466
"the we spot."

08:36.466 --> 08:37.566
(laughs)

08:39.066 --> 08:40.700
The last one
was a joke, right?

08:41.633 --> 08:43.033
Um--

08:43.033 --> 08:45.733
There is a "disconnect"
going on here, Erica,

08:45.733 --> 08:48.000
between what you pitched,
what we want,

08:48.000 --> 08:49.366
and what
you're presenting.

08:49.366 --> 08:51.466
Yeah, in english,
it's a pile o' shite.

08:52.466 --> 08:55.266
You came to us
with this fresh concept.

08:55.266 --> 08:56.533
31 flavours of sex.

08:56.533 --> 08:58.566
From vanilla
to tiger tail;

08:58.566 --> 09:00.733
masturbation
to pony play.

09:00.733 --> 09:02.333
We want a book
that's transgressive.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.266
One that pushes
all the boundaries.

09:04.266 --> 09:06.566
Yeah,
so stop being a prude

09:06.566 --> 09:09.366
and make this
title more raw, Erica.

09:09.366 --> 09:10.700
More basic,
more animal.

09:10.700 --> 09:11.733
More, more--
Bang! Pow!

09:11.733 --> 09:13.533
You got it right there,
right there.

09:13.533 --> 09:15.333
Pow! Right there.
You see that look?

09:15.333 --> 09:16.733
Pow! You see that?

09:16.733 --> 09:18.733
That prudish look
is what's holding you back.

09:18.733 --> 09:20.533
Erica: Okay,
what if I had, uh--

09:20.533 --> 09:23.033
Meeri set me up
on an interview

09:23.033 --> 09:24.233
with, like,
uh, a dominatrix?

09:24.233 --> 09:24.766
Julianne: Delicious!

09:24.766 --> 09:25.533
Erica: Good, great.

09:25.533 --> 09:26.533
Erica: Maybe a madame?

09:26.533 --> 09:27.533
Julianne: No, no, no.

09:27.533 --> 09:29.633
I mean, "delicious"
the club.

09:29.633 --> 09:31.000
The sex club.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.566
Downtown,
where anything goes?

09:32.566 --> 09:35.266
Friedken: Yeah, go there,
Erica, tonight.

09:35.266 --> 09:36.433
Julianne: Broaden
your mind.

09:36.433 --> 09:38.233
Find someone who lives
and breathes sex.

09:40.233 --> 09:43.200
Absolutely.
I am on it, tonight.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.333
Delicious.

09:48.033 --> 09:50.700
I'm sorry I can't take you two
to the airport tonight.

09:50.700 --> 09:52.300
Samantha: Erica, it's fine.
Work's work.

09:52.300 --> 09:55.300
Well, going to a sex club
doesn't sound like work to me.

09:55.300 --> 09:57.500
You better keep an eye
on this one, Ethan.

09:57.500 --> 09:58.733
The last
thing you want

09:58.733 --> 10:01.133
is for her to nibble on
some forbidden fruit.

10:01.133 --> 10:02.233
(laughs)

10:02.233 --> 10:03.400
Don't worry,
I'll be right beside her.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.366
Josh: Still, I'd, uh,
keep her on a leash.

10:05.366 --> 10:06.600
Samantha: Shh.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.000
What?

10:08.000 --> 10:09.333
It's a sex club.

10:10.100 --> 10:11.533
So, Sam,
what part of London

10:11.533 --> 10:13.333
are you gonna look
for a flat?

10:13.333 --> 10:14.733
Samantha: Well,
it's a huge city

10:14.733 --> 10:16.600
and there are some
really cute parts.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.533
Josh: West end,
period.

10:19.733 --> 10:22.333
Still, if Sam's gonna be
the one stuck at home--

10:22.333 --> 10:23.500
The west end's great.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.066
There's theatre,
stuff to do.

10:25.066 --> 10:27.066
You know, for when
you come and visit.

10:27.066 --> 10:28.366
Erica: Right.

10:28.366 --> 10:29.433
So,
is everyone done?

10:29.433 --> 10:30.333
Barbara: Yes, darling.

10:30.333 --> 10:31.633
Erica: I'll take
your plates.

10:31.633 --> 10:32.666
Erica:
Thank you, mom.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.566
Barbara:
Thank you.

10:34.566 --> 10:36.600
(snort of disgust)

10:37.600 --> 10:38.633
Mmm.

10:38.633 --> 10:41.000
All you need
is a french maid outfit.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.566
I'm good, thanks.

10:42.566 --> 10:44.566
You know,
London will be good for Sam.

10:44.566 --> 10:47.400
Take her out of her
comfort zone.

10:47.400 --> 10:48.666
I mean, uh,

10:48.666 --> 10:49.700
she practically
lives here.

10:49.700 --> 10:51.566
Maybe that's because
we're her family?

10:51.566 --> 10:53.200
Josh: Uh-huh.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.166
And I'm
her husband.

10:55.366 --> 10:57.566
Come on, Erica, I know
you wanna say something.

10:57.566 --> 10:58.400
Go ahead.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.000
Go on,
go on, go on,

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
enlighten me
on my own marriage.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Put your nose where
it doesn't belong again.

11:04.000 --> 11:04.633
Josh.

11:04.633 --> 11:08.200
What?

11:08.200 --> 11:09.333
Ethan:
Hey, Erica.

11:09.333 --> 11:10.733
Your mom wants
this wrapped up.

11:10.733 --> 11:12.200
Erica: Great. thank you.

11:12.200 --> 11:13.766
Josh: Well, I'm ready for
dessert? Anybody else?

11:13.766 --> 11:16.366
Barb, you want to satisfy
my sweet tooth or what?

11:16.366 --> 11:17.366
(seething exhale)

11:18.000 --> 11:19.266
Hey,
what's going on?

11:19.266 --> 11:21.200
I swear that he's pushing
my buttons on purpose.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.000
He's trying
to get me to react

11:23.000 --> 11:24.600
so that I say
something I regret--

11:24.600 --> 11:26.333
And it's
good you didn't.

11:26.333 --> 11:27.266
Good?

11:27.266 --> 11:28.600
You minded
your own business.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.600
It was the
right thing to do.

11:31.600 --> 11:32.466
Look,

11:32.466 --> 11:33.700
let's get
outta here, okay?

11:33.700 --> 11:36.133
Let's go home
and get ready for our big,

11:36.133 --> 11:37.733
weird night out.

11:37.733 --> 11:38.366
(sighing)

11:38.366 --> 11:41.333
Okay, thanks.

I mean, all of this,

12:47.133 --> 12:49.433
it doesn't cause a problem
in your marriage?

12:49.433 --> 12:52.600
The reality is our marriage
is more open than most people's.

More open sexually
and emotionally.

13:02.033 --> 13:04.100
So I mean,
what can you be jealous of?

13:04.100 --> 13:06.200
That you're having sex
with other people?

13:06.200 --> 13:07.700
Sex is
completely natural.

13:07.700 --> 13:09.733
All these rules
around it aren't.

13:09.733 --> 13:13.600
And you don't think that
they're there for a reason?

13:13.600 --> 13:15.133

I could do it.

13:42.466 --> 13:44.466
Ethan: They wanted us
to have a foursome.

13:44.466 --> 13:46.066
I've never even
had a threesome.

13:46.066 --> 13:48.266
Oh, well,
they're overrated.

13:48.266 --> 13:50.200
I'm joking.

14:51.333 --> 14:52.600

14:52.600 --> 14:54.233
Well, it is
to me, so--

14:54.233 --> 14:57.633
Please, can we just,
can we just go?

15:18.533 --> 15:19.333

15:19.333 --> 15:20.500

15:20.500 --> 15:22.600
Why do you think that
bothers you so much?

15:22.600 --> 15:24.000
I can honestly say,

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
that tonight has been one
of the weirdest nights

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
of my life.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.733
Yeah? Well, please,
have a seat.

15:29.733 --> 15:31.033
Bare your soul.

15:31.033 --> 15:32.033
Uh ah--

15:33.266 --> 15:34.266
Okay.

15:35.266 --> 15:37.166
Let's see here,
okay.

15:38.733 --> 15:43.733
I have never seen
people have sex live--

15:45.033 --> 15:46.233
Before tonight.

15:46.233 --> 15:48.733
And they just had it
all hanging out, you know?

15:48.733 --> 15:50.766
Their kinks and their--

15:50.766 --> 15:52.133
Bits and pieces
and--

15:52.133 --> 15:53.766
Yep. and you didn't run away
screaming though,

15:53.766 --> 15:54.766
did you?

15:54.766 --> 15:56.733
All those conventions
and taboos

15:56.733 --> 15:58.366
being broken
in one room.

15:58.366 --> 16:01.633
Well, at first,
it was shocking and--

16:01.633 --> 16:03.733
But then after awhile,
I don't know--

16:03.733 --> 16:07.000
It-It
kinda seemed like--

16:08.733 --> 16:10.366
"normal" is not
the right word,

16:10.366 --> 16:12.300
but--

16:12.300 --> 16:13.400
Like that couple.

16:13.400 --> 16:15.400
They cheat on
each other all the time,

16:15.400 --> 16:18.133
but they seem way happier
than my parents ever did.

16:18.133 --> 16:19.333
Maybe they
have it right.

16:19.333 --> 16:21.200
"nobody realizes
that some people

16:21.200 --> 16:25.666
expend tremendous energy
merely to be normal."

16:25.666 --> 16:26.766
Albert Camus.

16:26.766 --> 16:29.066
Take Ethan.
We were kissing

16:29.066 --> 16:31.166
and a couple people
stopped to watch

16:31.166 --> 16:33.133
and it was
too much for him.

16:33.133 --> 16:34.466
Yeah, well--

16:34.466 --> 16:36.433
Maybe Ethan prefers to be
affectionate in private.

16:36.433 --> 16:39.433
Or he's hung up
on the rules.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.400
Like I can't be
friends with Kai.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.400
Why should I have
to turn my back

16:43.400 --> 16:45.300
on the only other
patient I know

16:45.300 --> 16:47.000
because what,
he's a guy?

16:47.000 --> 16:48.733
I mean, that's--
That's insane.

16:48.733 --> 16:50.133
Right.
I'll tell you what,

16:50.133 --> 16:51.533
let's do a little
experiment here.

16:51.533 --> 16:53.133
It doesn't involve
you standing up?

16:53.133 --> 16:54.533
Uh, no.

16:54.533 --> 16:56.600
Today, this session is not
going to be about a regret.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.633
No?

16:57.633 --> 16:59.200
No.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.400
Okay, so, from the moment
that you woke up

17:01.400 --> 17:02.400
until right now

17:02.400 --> 17:03.600
when you came through
that door,

17:03.600 --> 17:06.066
I'm giving you
a day long do-over.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.300
Okay?
Nothing will stick

17:07.300 --> 17:11.066
and everything new
will be erased.

17:11.066 --> 17:12.333
Really?

17:12.333 --> 17:14.700
So everything
I do today,

17:14.700 --> 17:16.033
it can be undone?

17:16.033 --> 17:18.166
Well, not only can be,
it will be undone.

17:18.166 --> 17:21.033
Except, of course,
for your memories.

17:21.033 --> 17:23.300
So, just go back
and do whatever you want.

17:23.300 --> 17:24.300
Rules be damned.

17:24.300 --> 17:25.700
Go jump out
of a plane,

17:25.700 --> 17:27.700
or gamble away
your life's savings.

17:27.700 --> 17:28.700
Walk around naked?

17:28.700 --> 17:30.633
Yeah. see,
now you got it.

17:30.633 --> 17:33.433
You've spent all day today
being bound by the rules.

17:33.433 --> 17:35.266
Well, why don't you try
going back

17:35.266 --> 17:37.366
and reliving today
without any.

17:49.266 --> 17:50.166
(beanbag chair rustles)

18:01.500 --> 18:02.566
(light kick)

18:06.366 --> 18:08.300

18:08.300 --> 18:10.200

18:10.200 --> 18:12.266
(grunts,
liberated squeals)

18:14.400 --> 18:15.400
(grunting)

18:18.766 --> 18:19.766
oof!

18:21.733 --> 18:23.333
(relieved exhale)

18:27.433 --> 18:28.766
(water splatters in shower)

18:32.466 --> 18:33.700
(toilet flushes,
Ethan grunts, startled)

18:33.700 --> 18:35.233
Ethan:
Erica, what the hell?

18:35.233 --> 18:37.033
We need to talk about
last night

18:37.033 --> 18:38.700
and it can't wait.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.700
Look, I know that
you don't want me

18:40.700 --> 18:42.100
to be friends with Kai.

18:42.100 --> 18:43.200
I never said that.

18:43.200 --> 18:45.466
And I know that it's
because of claire

18:45.466 --> 18:48.066
and how she cheated on you
and she hurt you.

18:48.066 --> 18:50.633
But Ethan,
I'm not Claire.

18:50.633 --> 18:52.000
(curtain rattles)

18:52.000 --> 18:53.633
I know you're not
Claire, okay?

18:53.633 --> 18:55.633
I'm sorry, you and Kai
as friends, it's--

18:55.633 --> 18:58.033
It's what, it's weird
and unconventional?

18:58.033 --> 18:59.666
I mean, maybe,
but why?

18:59.666 --> 19:01.566
I don't know.

19:01.566 --> 19:05.766
Look, Kai is a friend

19:05.766 --> 19:10.100
and that friendship
will never get between us.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.400
Okay.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.100
Oh.

19:16.100 --> 19:18.666
Look at you,
you're all clean.

19:18.666 --> 19:19.733
That's too bad.

19:19.733 --> 19:21.100
Why?

19:21.100 --> 19:22.466
Oh, because--

19:22.466 --> 19:25.033
Once I'm
done with you--

19:25.033 --> 19:27.366
You're gonna have
to take a shower

19:27.366 --> 19:29.000
all over again.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.600
(exhales, stunned)

19:30.600 --> 19:31.433
Wow.

19:36.466 --> 19:38.300
Erica:
Woooo-ooo-ooo!

19:38.300 --> 19:40.366
Judith: Oh my god.
Erica!

19:42.200 --> 19:45.233
What the hell
has gotten into you?

19:45.233 --> 19:46.066
Erica: Excuse me.

19:46.066 --> 19:47.133
Judith: Erica.

19:47.133 --> 19:50.133
Judith: Eri--
oh my god, I'm sorry.

19:51.133 --> 19:53.666
Can you please
stop that? Now?

19:53.666 --> 19:55.100
Erica:
No, I will not.

19:55.100 --> 19:57.200
In fact,
I think you should join me.

19:57.200 --> 20:00.166
Judith: I'm sorry,
she's just a bit happy today.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.766
Good for you,
you made first contact.

20:01.766 --> 20:03.200
Now go talk to her.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.366
Erica, no.

20:04.366 --> 20:05.366
Judith!

20:07.100 --> 20:08.100
Hi, there.

20:09.466 --> 20:12.000
I'm Erica
and this is Judith.

20:12.000 --> 20:12.700
Hey.

20:12.700 --> 20:13.500
What's your name?

20:13.500 --> 20:15.466
Saadia.

20:15.466 --> 20:16.733
It's a beautiful name.

20:16.733 --> 20:18.100
(shocked gasp)

20:18.100 --> 20:20.500
and your son, he's adorable.
What's his name?

20:20.500 --> 20:22.066
Saadia:
Hasan.

20:22.066 --> 20:23.166
How old is he?

20:23.166 --> 20:24.633
Saadia:
Uh, six months last tuesday.

20:24.633 --> 20:26.233
Yours looks about
the same age.

20:26.233 --> 20:28.033
Judith: Yup, six months
next week.

20:28.033 --> 20:30.033
Listen, it was really
lovely to meet you,

20:30.033 --> 20:31.333
but I have to run.

20:31.333 --> 20:33.033
Okay, um--

20:33.033 --> 20:34.433
I'll call you later?!

20:34.433 --> 20:37.433
I will see you later,
alligator! Yeah!

20:37.433 --> 20:40.066
You charged me five bucks
for milk bubbles?!

20:40.066 --> 20:42.066
It's no prob,
I'll make you another one.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.133
Excuse me.

20:45.133 --> 20:46.100
Hello.

20:46.100 --> 20:47.300
I really can't talk
right now.

20:47.300 --> 20:49.033
Have you ever seen
that movie "groundhog day"

20:49.033 --> 20:50.633
with Bill Murray,
from the early '90s?

20:50.633 --> 20:52.033
When I was five?
No.

20:52.033 --> 20:54.133
He gets to live
a day over,

20:54.133 --> 20:56.633
and it turns out
my therapist

20:57.366 --> 20:58.766
is doing
the same for me.

20:58.766 --> 20:59.400
Erica.

20:59.400 --> 21:00.333
Whatever, Kai,

21:00.333 --> 21:02.066
they're not
gonna remember.

21:02.066 --> 21:03.066
Really?

21:04.733 --> 21:06.133
You get to redo today?

21:06.133 --> 21:09.000
Oh, no,
I am redoing today.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
Everything I do
for the rest of the day

21:12.000 --> 21:12.700
doesn't stick.

21:12.700 --> 21:13.566
Man: Kid!

21:13.566 --> 21:16.433
Kai: I'll just
be a sec.

21:16.433 --> 21:18.233
All right,
so say I believe you

21:18.233 --> 21:20.233
and your day really
is gonna be erased,

21:20.233 --> 21:21.466
if I'm by your side?

21:21.466 --> 21:23.266
Everything I do with you,
it's undone.

21:23.266 --> 21:25.466
I mean, why do you think
I came here?

21:25.466 --> 21:27.466
You're the only person
I know

21:27.466 --> 21:29.433
that can truly
appreciate this.

21:29.433 --> 21:31.233
Man: If I get
a ticket, okay,

21:31.233 --> 21:33.066
it's coming right outta
this tip jar.

21:33.066 --> 21:35.466
Erica: Yo, moby dick,
why don't you tone it down?

21:35.466 --> 21:36.466
Excuse me?

21:39.133 --> 21:41.533
You're 100 percent sure
your doc's not pulling your leg?

21:41.533 --> 21:43.000
Oh, yeah.

21:47.133 --> 21:48.133
And you wonder why

21:48.133 --> 21:50.133
you're slinging coffee
at your age?

21:54.766 --> 21:57.400
Now that's
a $5 dollar latte.

21:57.400 --> 21:58.633
Erica:
So--

21:58.633 --> 22:00.233
Are you ready, you
big rebel?

22:00.233 --> 22:03.166
Kai: Oh, yeah,
I'm pretty much fired anyway.

22:04.200 --> 22:05.200
Hello.

22:07.033 --> 22:10.266
What kind of trouble
should we get into?

22:10.266 --> 22:12.133
(car security beeps off)

22:12.133 --> 22:13.733
Uh, what're do
you doing?

22:13.733 --> 22:16.400
Kai: My favourite customer
left his keys on the counter.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.666
Let's call it a tip.

22:17.666 --> 22:19.300
Let's call it
"grand theft auto."

22:19.300 --> 22:20.366
Forget it.

22:20.366 --> 22:21.733
Erica, the first
rule of do-over-day

22:21.733 --> 22:23.200
is there are no rules.

22:23.200 --> 22:24.633
Uh--

22:24.633 --> 22:27.633
I swear, if I spend the rest
of the day behind bars,

22:27.633 --> 22:29.033
I'm never
gonna forgive you.

22:29.033 --> 22:31.233
And I'll
never remember.

22:31.233 --> 22:32.233
Hop in.

22:32.233 --> 22:33.666
(excited squeal)

22:33.666 --> 22:34.666
(revs engine)

22:34.666 --> 22:37.366
♪ Oh, the boss is coming ♪

22:37.366 --> 22:39.766
(wild screams)

22:40.766 --> 22:42.166
Mercedes-benz.

22:42.166 --> 22:44.133
Clk63 amg.

22:45.166 --> 22:47.466
475 horse power,

22:47.466 --> 22:50.233
0 to 100
in 4.7 seconds.

22:50.233 --> 22:53.100
They do not make cars
like these any more.

22:53.100 --> 22:56.366
Any more? This thing,
it looks brand new.

22:57.366 --> 23:01.766
Look at you,
enjoying the perks of therapy.

23:01.766 --> 23:04.133
It's not
all bad, huh?

23:04.133 --> 23:05.666
I never said it was.

23:07.166 --> 23:10.266
So then tell me
your doctor's name.

23:10.266 --> 23:13.433
Oh, come on, Kai,
you're not gonna remember.

23:13.433 --> 23:15.600
Fine,
it's doctor Fred.

23:16.600 --> 23:18.766
(Erica's cell phone rings)

23:20.333 --> 23:22.133
Oh great.

23:22.133 --> 23:24.600
Look,
I'm late for work.

23:24.600 --> 23:28.533
Last thing I need is to hear
my boss bitch me out.

23:28.533 --> 23:32.466
So why don't you go
do the bitching?

23:32.466 --> 23:33.100
Oh--

23:33.100 --> 23:35.000
(chuckles)

23:35.000 --> 23:36.266
Oh yeah.

23:36.266 --> 23:37.266
Wooooooo!

23:42.266 --> 23:43.666
(sucks her teeth)

23:43.666 --> 23:44.600
Good morning.

23:44.600 --> 23:46.400
A good boss
is a calm boss,

23:46.400 --> 23:49.133
a good boss
is a calm boss.

23:49.133 --> 23:50.200
Erica: Hellooooo!

23:51.566 --> 23:53.200
Oh.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.266
Julianne: Since when is coming
to work two hours late okay?

23:55.266 --> 23:57.266
Who the hell
do you think you are?

23:57.266 --> 23:58.466
Oprah?!

23:58.466 --> 24:01.533
I was on Oprah once,
and, uh, Dr. Phil.

24:01.533 --> 24:03.333
Where have you been,
Erica?

24:03.333 --> 24:07.133
I have been with Kai,
my 22-year-old friend.

24:08.166 --> 24:09.300
He can sing,

24:09.300 --> 24:11.666
and as Meeri would say,
"he's righteous!"

24:11.666 --> 24:15.066
What? What the hell
is going on with her?

24:15.066 --> 24:18.066
In chapter five of
"the mystery of tomorrow,"

24:18.066 --> 24:19.100
it states...

24:19.100 --> 24:20.500
Wow, it's not even
published yet

24:20.500 --> 24:22.166
and he's
quoting himself.

24:22.166 --> 24:24.766
Your self-love,
it has no bounds, does it?

24:24.766 --> 24:25.533
Julianne: Erica!

24:25.533 --> 24:26.466
Erica: Julianne,

24:26.466 --> 24:29.000
Let me "break it down"
for you.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.400
This man is a dog.

24:31.400 --> 24:33.200
He turns you
into a giggling idiot.

24:33.200 --> 24:34.700
It is embarrassing

24:34.700 --> 24:36.233
and you
can do better.

24:37.233 --> 24:38.300
And you?!

24:38.300 --> 24:40.000
Huhn!

24:40.000 --> 24:42.533
You need to get
over yourself, seriously.

24:42.533 --> 24:45.033
"The secret
of now" sucked!

24:46.033 --> 24:47.666
Who--

24:50.200 --> 24:51.333
Oh. I gotta run.

24:53.333 --> 24:54.200
Hey, you.

24:54.200 --> 24:54.766
Hi there.

24:54.766 --> 24:56.066
Uh yes?

24:56.066 --> 24:58.033
Um, I know that we've
never actually met,

24:58.033 --> 25:00.233
but I've spent the last year
admiring your ass.

25:00.233 --> 25:02.333
It's truly spectacular.

25:02.333 --> 25:03.766
Um, I'm married.

25:03.766 --> 25:05.366
Oh, totally.
I'm with someone too.

25:05.366 --> 25:07.366
I was just wondering
if you'd mind if--

25:09.100 --> 25:10.100
Wow.

25:11.233 --> 25:14.300
Bye everyone.
See you tomorrow.

25:16.200 --> 25:17.266
I think you're hot!

25:17.266 --> 25:18.700
Kai:
You think I look hot?

25:18.700 --> 25:20.600
Erica:
Totally smokin' hot!

25:20.600 --> 25:24.033
I feel like the gayest cowboy
since brokeback mountain.

25:24.033 --> 25:25.200
Thanks.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.300
Hey, it wasn't my idea
to play "truth or dare."

25:27.300 --> 25:29.266
Today of all days.

25:30.266 --> 25:31.666
So, what's it gonna be,
partner?

25:33.166 --> 25:34.366
Kai: Erica.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.500
Erica: Truth or dare?
It's your turn.

25:36.500 --> 25:38.300
Fine.

25:38.300 --> 25:40.066
Truth.

25:40.066 --> 25:41.133
Really?

25:42.266 --> 25:43.266
Finally.

25:44.633 --> 25:47.233
Why won't you talk to me
about your therapy?

25:49.200 --> 25:51.000
'cause I did something
in my past

25:51.000 --> 25:53.366
I wanna forget.

25:53.366 --> 25:55.033
That's not really answering
my question.

25:55.033 --> 25:56.233
I mean,
in my experience,

25:56.233 --> 25:58.500
you can't just avoid
your regret.

25:58.500 --> 26:00.033
If it's on the list,

26:00.033 --> 26:02.766
the rule is...
You have to relive it.

26:03.766 --> 26:05.733
What is it you're trying
to forget?

26:05.733 --> 26:07.166
You don't get
two questions.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.200
Okay,
no, no, no.

26:08.200 --> 26:09.766
I'm not playing the game
anymore, Kai.

26:09.766 --> 26:13.300
Just, I'm asking
you as a friend.

26:16.533 --> 26:19.266
Someone died
because of me.

26:21.366 --> 26:22.433
You know, Kai,

26:22.433 --> 26:24.733
they're called regrets
for a reason.

26:24.733 --> 26:27.133
No judgment here,
okay?

26:29.666 --> 26:31.666
Okay, well,
you owe me now.

26:31.666 --> 26:33.400
Truth or dare?

26:34.400 --> 26:35.400
(laughs)

26:37.433 --> 26:38.533
Dare.

26:38.533 --> 26:41.200
All right, I dare you
to face a real fear;

26:42.200 --> 26:44.300
do something
you always wanted to do,

26:44.300 --> 26:45.300
but can't.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.000
How fast do you think
a mercedes

26:51.000 --> 26:54.066
could get us up
to North York?

26:54.066 --> 26:56.200
Depends who's driving.

26:57.400 --> 26:58.566
Erica:
Yeeeow!

26:59.766 --> 27:01.233
Erica?

27:01.233 --> 27:03.566
Barbara:
Honey, is that you?

27:06.066 --> 27:07.200
(front door
squeaks shut)

27:07.200 --> 27:08.766
Barbara:
Where were you?

27:08.766 --> 27:10.300
Why didn't you call?!

27:10.300 --> 27:12.100
Meeri said you
left work hours ago.

27:12.100 --> 27:14.700
Uh, you know what?
Why don't you guys go sit down

27:14.700 --> 27:16.733
and I'm just gonna grab
something to eat.

27:16.733 --> 27:19.500
And I will promise to explain
everything to you.

27:20.766 --> 27:22.033
Josh:
Oh good.

27:23.300 --> 27:24.300
Erica:
Thanks.

27:25.333 --> 27:26.700
(bottle cap clatters)

27:26.700 --> 27:28.066
Nice work, Erica,

27:28.066 --> 27:29.500
freaking Ethan
and Barb out.

27:29.500 --> 27:31.700
Sam, too,
not that she showed it.

27:31.700 --> 27:34.300
Mm. and how would you know
that Sam's upset?

27:34.300 --> 27:35.333
Because I know Sam.

27:35.333 --> 27:37.000
You know Sam.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.366
We're married.

27:38.366 --> 27:40.200
Oh yeah, you probably
blocked that out

27:40.200 --> 27:43.000
since your maid of honour
speech was something like:

27:43.000 --> 27:44.266
"Oh, dearest sister Sam,

27:44.266 --> 27:46.333
please don't marry
that asshole Josh.

27:46.333 --> 27:48.166
'cause he doesn't love you.

27:48.166 --> 27:50.700
Hugs and kisses, Erica."
Right?

27:50.700 --> 27:52.033
Well, you don't.

27:52.033 --> 27:53.133
I know that.

27:53.133 --> 27:55.333
Mom finally starting
to figure it out.

27:55.333 --> 27:58.266
Deep down inside,
sam knows it too.

27:58.266 --> 27:59.333
You don't know shit.

27:59.333 --> 28:01.266
Look, Josh, I'm not here
to point fingers

28:01.266 --> 28:02.266
or to attack you.

28:02.266 --> 28:03.200
Really?

28:03.200 --> 28:05.066
Yeah. but there is something
that I need to say.

28:05.066 --> 28:07.033
Oh, I cannot wait
to hear this.

28:07.033 --> 28:08.733
Dragging Sam
off to England,

28:08.733 --> 28:10.166
it's not gonna
fix something

28:10.166 --> 28:12.566
as broken
as your relationship.

28:12.566 --> 28:14.366
"dragging" Sam?

28:14.366 --> 28:15.600
She wants to go.

28:15.600 --> 28:18.066
Are you sure?
Have you ever even asked her?

28:18.066 --> 28:20.266
Because I think she's going
only for you.

28:20.266 --> 28:21.700
This is none
of your business.

28:21.700 --> 28:24.100
Actually, yes,
it is my business

28:24.100 --> 28:25.600
because she's my sister.

28:25.600 --> 28:27.433
And you, Josh,
I've known you, what?

28:27.433 --> 28:29.133
Since you were 14?

28:29.133 --> 28:31.133
You're 30 now

28:31.133 --> 28:34.200
and you still
don't look happy.

28:35.433 --> 28:38.066
I want my sister
to be happy.

28:38.066 --> 28:40.166
So please, go and do
the right thing

28:40.166 --> 28:42.300
for once in your life.

28:45.566 --> 28:47.300
(inhales and exhales)

28:55.500 --> 28:56.766
(relieved sigh)

29:01.033 --> 29:03.600
Barbara:
Erica, something's wrong.

29:03.600 --> 29:05.200
They've locked themselves
in Sam's bedroom.

29:05.200 --> 29:07.000
Ethan:
What did you say to Josh?

29:07.000 --> 29:08.700
The truth.

29:08.700 --> 29:11.000
What we  should've
told him, them,

29:11.000 --> 29:12.466
a long time ago.

29:12.466 --> 29:14.300
(doorbell dings)

29:14.300 --> 29:16.133
Mm. I'll get it.

29:22.300 --> 29:24.700
It's the end of the world
as we know it.

29:24.700 --> 29:26.200
Indeed. it is.

29:26.200 --> 29:28.333
Hey, did you realize that
by the end of this century,

29:28.333 --> 29:30.533
our planet will warm
by more than six degrees?

29:30.533 --> 29:32.366
No. no, that's not
what I meant.

29:32.366 --> 29:33.666
I meant in here.

29:33.666 --> 29:34.700
Sam and Josh,

29:34.700 --> 29:36.266
they're finally
having "the talk"

29:36.266 --> 29:37.433
about
their relationship.

29:37.433 --> 29:39.333
I did the thing
you're not supposed to do;

29:39.333 --> 29:40.600
I meddled and--

29:40.600 --> 29:42.300
Fingers crossed,
the logjam has burst.

29:42.300 --> 29:44.366
"to succeed in life
you need two things:

29:44.366 --> 29:45.633
ignorance
and confidence."

29:45.633 --> 29:47.100
Mark Twain.

29:47.100 --> 29:48.600
I'm tired of holding myself back
because of "rules."

29:48.600 --> 29:49.500
Great.

29:49.500 --> 29:50.233
From now on,

29:50.233 --> 29:52.100
I'm gonna do and say
exactly what I want.

29:52.100 --> 29:53.233
Good, good.

29:53.233 --> 29:54.500
You only answer
to yourself in life, right?

29:54.500 --> 29:56.100
You know,
every man for himself.

29:56.100 --> 29:57.166
You know, right?

29:57.166 --> 29:58.700
Uh no, that's not
exactly what I mean.

29:58.700 --> 30:00.033
Listen, Erica,

30:00.033 --> 30:01.500
do you think all those
suv drivers out there

30:01.500 --> 30:03.100
stop and worry
about anybody else

30:03.100 --> 30:04.700
as they're pumping tonnes
of carbon dioxide

30:04.700 --> 30:05.700
into the atmosphere?

30:05.700 --> 30:07.300
Hell no!
And they look happy, right?

30:07.300 --> 30:08.266
You know, kinda.

30:08.266 --> 30:09.733
You just go for
whatever you want,

30:09.733 --> 30:11.333
you know,
when you want it

30:11.333 --> 30:12.533
and everything else'll
just whatever--

30:12.533 --> 30:13.666
It'll sort itself out.

30:13.666 --> 30:17.266
Okay, I'll see you later.
Hey, enjoy.

30:27.400 --> 30:29.100
(bedroom door closes)

30:33.000 --> 30:37.000
it was uh,
It was no one.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.733
I'll put the bags
in the car.

30:38.733 --> 30:40.400
Honey, are you okay?

30:45.566 --> 30:48.500
You think that
I'm making a mistake.

30:48.500 --> 30:50.533
You think that
I'm following Josh,

30:50.533 --> 30:53.333
that I'm too weak to
stand up for what I want.

30:53.333 --> 30:54.533
Erica: We're just worried.

30:54.533 --> 30:56.133
Samantha: Erica,
you are the last person

30:56.133 --> 30:59.033
to tell anyone
how to live, okay?

30:59.033 --> 30:59.600
Erica: Sam.

30:59.600 --> 31:00.600
Samantha: No!

31:00.600 --> 31:02.533
What makes
your life so perfect

31:02.533 --> 31:05.100
that you can constantly
do this to me?

31:05.100 --> 31:06.533
Erica's finally
got a real job

31:06.533 --> 31:08.033
and a
real relationship,

31:08.033 --> 31:11.266
and isn't she so wise now
that at the age of 32,

31:11.266 --> 31:14.400
she can actually pay her rent
without anyone's help!

31:14.400 --> 31:16.333
You are so arrogant.

31:16.333 --> 31:19.500
You think that you can just say
anything that you want

31:19.500 --> 31:21.400
to me, to Josh.

31:21.400 --> 31:26.266
You are constantly
ripping apart all my decisions,

31:27.666 --> 31:30.166
I want to
move to England.

31:31.166 --> 31:35.366
I wanna get me and my husband
as far away as I can from you!

31:35.366 --> 31:36.366
Erica:
Sam!

31:39.233 --> 31:40.100
Erica: Josh, I--

31:40.100 --> 31:41.300
Josh:
Would you shut up?

31:41.300 --> 31:43.133
You don't give a
shit about me.

31:43.133 --> 31:44.400
You never have.

31:48.733 --> 31:51.533
Did you even think about
what this would do to Sam?

31:51.533 --> 31:53.333
Ethan, I really don't
need a lecture--

31:53.333 --> 31:54.733
Or did you
just plow ahead

31:54.733 --> 31:56.333
and say, "Hey,
screw the consequences?"

31:56.333 --> 31:57.766
I did this to help her.

31:57.766 --> 31:59.366
Yeah, well,
clearly Sam doesn't need

31:59.366 --> 32:01.166
or want your help.

32:01.166 --> 32:04.300
Kai: Hey, Erica,
everything okay?

32:04.300 --> 32:05.733
What is
he doing here?

32:05.733 --> 32:07.600
Oh my god,
this is a nightmare.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.633
Oh, I see.
You didn't go to work,

32:09.633 --> 32:12.066
you didn't call,
you spent the day with him!

32:12.066 --> 32:13.700
Ethan, really,
everything's cool.

32:13.700 --> 32:15.266
Kai, please,
just don't.

32:15.266 --> 32:17.500
Okay, Ethan,
I know what this looks like,

32:17.500 --> 32:19.733
but that is not
what's happening, okay?

32:19.733 --> 32:21.333
Kai and I,
Just friends, right?

32:21.333 --> 32:23.366
No. yes.
We're just friends.

32:23.366 --> 32:25.700
We're not even friends.
We're actually--

32:25.700 --> 32:28.500
You're what?
What, Erica?

32:30.533 --> 32:31.766
We're time-travellers.

32:31.766 --> 32:33.566
And I know that
that sounds crazy,

32:33.566 --> 32:35.000
but it's the truth,
okay?

32:35.000 --> 32:36.100
Uh, look, last year,

32:36.100 --> 32:38.233
I told you that
I went to the hospital

32:38.233 --> 32:40.066
after I ate that hazelnut
frappa-thing, right?

32:40.066 --> 32:41.366
Do you remember?

32:41.366 --> 32:44.533
And then I met
this therapist and I--

32:44.533 --> 32:46.033
I know
this sounds insane.

32:46.033 --> 32:48.500
Insane? That you and Kai travel
through time together?

32:48.500 --> 32:51.100
No, not together.
Separately.

32:51.700 --> 32:54.500
Well, I am the last guy
to stand in the way

32:54.500 --> 32:56.166
of that kind
of a friendship.

32:56.166 --> 32:59.466
Ethan, please,
I am telling you the truth.

33:02.233 --> 33:03.300
(ignition turns)

33:03.300 --> 33:04.466
Ethan.

33:07.400 --> 33:09.533
(exhales heavily)

33:21.366 --> 33:23.766
(keys jangle,
engine shuts off)

33:26.300 --> 33:28.533
(inhales shakily)

33:28.533 --> 33:29.533
Look, Erica,

33:30.666 --> 33:33.533
in a couple hours,
this'll all be erased.

33:33.533 --> 33:36.333
What went down tonight
wasn't technically real.

33:36.333 --> 33:39.500
Yeah?
Well, it felt pretty real.

33:42.100 --> 33:44.700
I'm never gonna be able
to tell him about my therapy

33:44.700 --> 33:45.700
am I?

33:48.233 --> 33:51.266
Kai, you're the only person
I can talk to about this.

33:51.266 --> 33:52.700
(cop siren beeps twice)

33:52.700 --> 33:57.133
Cop: You in the mercedes,
step out of the car, please.

38:20.266 --> 38:21.633
About the weirdness
this morning?

38:21.633 --> 38:23.266
No, that was
all my fault.

38:23.266 --> 38:26.633
I let my issues with Claire

38:26.633 --> 38:28.400

38:28.400 --> 38:30.166
No, I didn't.

38:30.166 --> 38:32.000
Like you said,
you're not her.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.566
You could never do
the things she did.

38:35.566 --> 38:36.566
Hey.

38:39.333 --> 38:42.133
Be friends
with whoever you want.

38:43.133 --> 38:44.633
I trust you.

38:48.133 --> 38:49.133
Mmm.

That you have a killer figure?

Friedy--

39:12.700 --> 39:14.700
(unintelligible chatter)

39:16.466 --> 39:18.400
(clears throat)

39:18.400 --> 39:20.433
There she is,
our little sex tourist.

39:20.433 --> 39:23.633
Friedken: So, how'd it feel to
take a walk on the wild side?

39:23.633 --> 39:24.600
Erica: Um--

39:24.600 --> 39:25.566
Julianne: Uh oh!

39:25.566 --> 39:26.700
I smell
"disappointment"

39:26.700 --> 39:29.566
with a touch
of "desperation."

39:29.566 --> 39:30.600
What gives?

39:30.600 --> 39:32.000
I didn't find
any inspiration.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.600
And I don't think
that I will.

39:34.600 --> 39:37.533
Not with the direction
that we're taking the book.

39:37.533 --> 39:39.000
You know what I think?

39:39.000 --> 39:41.333
I think you're falling
into old habits, Erica.

39:41.333 --> 39:44.033
You're a sexual luddite

39:44.033 --> 39:45.633
and you've got hang-ups
and issues.

39:45.633 --> 39:48.233
Erica: Okay, think what you
want, but here's the thing.

39:48.233 --> 39:50.566
There's a reason 99.9 percent
of the population

39:50.566 --> 39:53.000
doesn't walk around
dressed in leather harnesses,

39:53.000 --> 39:56.066
and having group sex
or multiple partners.

39:56.066 --> 39:58.100
Yeah, because they've got
hang-ups and issues.

39:58.100 --> 40:00.500
You make a book that's aimed
specifically at the fringe,

40:00.500 --> 40:02.600
that's all you're
gonna get buying it.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.400
Okay, well,
what's your proposal then?

40:04.400 --> 40:06.600
What I would like
is to see the book

40:06.600 --> 40:08.100
fall somewhere
in the middle.

40:08.100 --> 40:09.366
Yes, we'll make a nod

40:09.366 --> 40:12.033
to the more "out there"
aspects of sexuality,

40:12.033 --> 40:13.400
and our fantasies,

40:13.400 --> 40:16.533
but I really feel that
you can't forget the core.

40:16.533 --> 40:18.700
Just real people.

40:18.700 --> 40:20.333
Because for the most part,

40:20.333 --> 40:21.733
we prefer to keep
our fantasies

40:21.733 --> 40:23.533
safely stowed
away in here.

40:23.533 --> 40:26.700
Friedken: I tell you, if I went
to "delicious" tonight,

40:26.700 --> 40:28.033
I'd come back.

40:28.033 --> 40:29.233
(grunts)

40:29.233 --> 40:31.033
with enough "juice"
to fill half a book.

40:31.033 --> 40:32.066
That's interesting,
Friedy,

40:32.066 --> 40:33.633
but Erica's editing
this book,

40:33.633 --> 40:35.266
not you.

40:35.266 --> 40:36.466
Follow this direction.

40:36.466 --> 40:38.066
Find me
the right author.

40:38.066 --> 40:40.300
But if you bring in
a piece of garbage--

40:40.300 --> 40:42.100
There will be
a price to pay.

40:42.100 --> 40:43.633
I got it.

40:43.633 --> 40:45.166
(traffic rumbles by)

40:53.766 --> 40:57.000
So, back in the
"real world" are we?

40:57.700 --> 40:59.100
The look
on Ethan's face.

40:59.100 --> 41:02.133
It keeps running on
repeat in my head.

41:02.133 --> 41:03.333
Dr. Tom:
Yeah.

41:03.333 --> 41:04.433
Hey,
well, technically,

41:04.433 --> 41:06.000
it never actually
happened though, right?

41:06.000 --> 41:07.200
But it did.

41:07.200 --> 41:08.600
And you said that
I would live regret-free.

41:08.600 --> 41:09.666
No, Erica.

41:09.666 --> 41:12.366
I told you to live the day
as you wanted

41:12.366 --> 41:14.033
and that nothing
would stick,

41:14.033 --> 41:17.500
but it seems
that something has.

41:17.500 --> 41:18.533
Something has

41:18.533 --> 41:21.700
and I have no idea
what to do about it.

41:21.700 --> 41:24.733
Everything has
a consequence, Erica.

41:25.733 --> 41:28.400
Every action
has a reaction.

41:29.400 --> 41:31.566
That's Isaac Newton,
right?

41:31.566 --> 41:33.366
Well, I was kinda
paraphrasing him there,

41:33.366 --> 41:34.600
but yeah.

41:34.600 --> 41:36.400
And now you have
a choice here:

41:36.400 --> 41:38.066
to do something
about your predicament

41:38.066 --> 41:39.700
or to not do
something about it.

41:39.700 --> 41:42.200
But regardless
of what road you choose,

41:42.200 --> 41:45.466
there will still
be consequences.

41:46.533 --> 41:48.733
'Cause there
always are.

41:48.733 --> 41:49.600
Always.

41:52.033 --> 41:53.366
Erica:
Consequences.

41:53.366 --> 41:56.300
When we ask the question
"why can't I?"

41:56.300 --> 41:59.033
They're right there,
staring us in the face;

41:59.033 --> 42:00.733
the answers
we don't want to hear.

42:00.733 --> 42:03.166
Hey, next time?
No experiments.

42:03.166 --> 42:06.233
Just our regularly
scheduled therapy.

42:10.500 --> 42:13.066
(mugs and utensils clank,
muddled chatter of patrons)

42:13.066 --> 42:14.300
Kai: It's coming
right up.

42:14.300 --> 42:15.766
Hey you.

42:15.766 --> 42:17.566
Gimme a sec?

42:17.566 --> 42:18.566
Enjoy.

42:20.666 --> 42:22.200
So.

42:22.200 --> 42:23.200
Yes?

42:23.200 --> 42:24.200
It's been awhile.

42:24.200 --> 42:26.033
Since?

42:26.033 --> 42:27.133
Since we've hung out.

42:27.133 --> 42:28.733
We've never actually
"hung out," Erica.

42:28.733 --> 42:31.000
Yeah, no, I guess,
I guess we haven't.

42:31.000 --> 42:31.766
(half laugh)

42:31.766 --> 42:33.433
So where were you
this morning?

42:33.433 --> 42:34.733
Avoiding me?

42:34.733 --> 42:37.533
'Cause I blocked your efforts
to get inside my head?

42:37.533 --> 42:38.433
Uh, not exactly.

42:38.433 --> 42:39.766
Well,
I'll tell you what,

42:39.766 --> 42:42.200
you treat a poor barista
to a fancy dinner,

42:42.200 --> 42:44.666
I'll answer anything
you wanna know.

42:44.666 --> 42:46.233
I can't.

42:46.233 --> 42:48.300
Okay.
What did I do?

42:48.300 --> 42:50.000
Nothing, honestly.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.400
I just, um--

42:53.000 --> 42:55.500
You know how you refused
to talk about your therapy

42:55.500 --> 42:57.533
and Dr. Fred?

42:57.533 --> 43:00.166
How did you know
my doctor's name is Fred?

43:00.166 --> 43:01.300
I just do.

43:01.300 --> 43:03.033
And I refuse to make
my boyfriend's life

43:03.033 --> 43:04.100
a living hell.

43:04.100 --> 43:05.433
Kai: Oh, so this
is about Ethan?

43:05.433 --> 43:08.233
He's telling you who you can
and can't be friends with?

43:08.233 --> 43:09.466
You're cool?

43:10.466 --> 43:12.633
It's my decision.

43:12.633 --> 43:13.700
Really?

43:15.200 --> 43:16.266
Really.

43:18.333 --> 43:23.033
I'll just see you
for your morning latte, then.
