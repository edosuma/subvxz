WEBVTT

00:01.407 --> 00:03.619
So, you know, I'm on the pill.

00:03.632 --> 00:04.939
There's something
that I need to tell him

00:04.978 --> 00:08.048
- and I'm not sure that I should.
- Is it something that you can tell me?

00:08.084 --> 00:10.615
Music therapy can actually
rewire an injured brain.

00:10.620 --> 00:13.177
Maybe I should have my brother
come check out your class then.

00:13.188 --> 00:16.290
He has a TBI and he's getting really
frustrated in physical therapy.

00:16.325 --> 00:19.727
I was talking to Ty's lawyer.
He's looking at up to five years.

00:19.762 --> 00:21.678
You're family, AJ. I wanna adopt you.

00:21.699 --> 00:24.231
What if you and Isabella
move in here with me and AJ?

00:24.266 --> 00:25.527
Ana has a record, you know.

00:25.545 --> 00:27.838
And you're fostering AJ.
She's a convicted felon.

00:27.958 --> 00:30.070
But technically, she's
not fostering him.

00:30.105 --> 00:31.776
I don't think that's
going to matter to CPS.

00:31.819 --> 00:33.848
I feel powerless having zero privacy,

00:33.849 --> 00:34.928
so I'm changing that.

00:34.997 --> 00:37.066
No wonder my lawyers
don't want to go to trial.

00:37.084 --> 00:38.881
If you believe this, I
should be locked up forever.

00:38.903 --> 00:40.082
So what's happening?

00:40.126 --> 00:42.769
Uh, Aaron was just helping
me finish my senior project.

00:42.804 --> 00:45.429
It's a cell, kind of like the
one they put me in at juvie.

00:47.659 --> 00:50.444
Are you injured or intoxicated?

00:51.181 --> 00:53.372
Against the wall! Now!

00:54.845 --> 00:57.850
This is the prison rape
elimination act questionnaire.

01:02.340 --> 01:04.610
I did exactly what you said!

01:04.620 --> 01:07.565
Stop that now!

01:08.329 --> 01:10.531
Inmate infraction! I need backup!

01:10.566 --> 01:12.391
Put your hands against the wall.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.122
Sit down!

01:16.111 --> 01:18.600
- Lay down!
- Sit down and shut up!

01:19.807 --> 01:21.532
So how many times you been in juvie?

01:21.560 --> 01:24.577
Let's hold questions and comments
for discussion group, please.

01:45.646 --> 01:46.988
So...

01:47.606 --> 01:49.126
I have anxiety,

01:49.161 --> 01:52.597
like medical anxiety.

01:52.888 --> 01:55.889
And my doctor told me
to take St. John's Wort.

01:55.905 --> 01:58.440
It's an herb that's supposed
to help you feel calmer.

01:59.205 --> 02:01.198
Anyway, the counselor here told me

02:01.204 --> 02:02.816
in my pre-interview thing the other day,

02:02.844 --> 02:05.114
that it can interfere
with birth control.

02:05.619 --> 02:09.086
So, thank you, Dr. Gordon.

02:11.053 --> 02:12.165
Well...

02:12.772 --> 02:14.879
at least, it's not your fault.

02:16.732 --> 02:18.479
Do you think I should feel bad?

02:19.715 --> 02:20.895
No.

02:21.434 --> 02:22.580
Really?

02:22.878 --> 02:24.777
'Cause doesn't that make me a

02:24.897 --> 02:27.659
cold-hearted bitch if I don't feel bad?

02:27.704 --> 02:30.944
But then if I do feel bad,
then why am I doing this?

02:30.945 --> 02:34.070
I must be wrong? Right?

02:38.158 --> 02:41.113
I don't know what to say.

02:43.152 --> 02:45.219
I'm not in your position.

02:46.910 --> 02:49.331
What if this were yours,
how would you feel?

02:50.567 --> 02:52.556
Um, I think, I would...

02:52.848 --> 02:55.731
support your right to
make your own decision.

02:56.107 --> 02:57.815
And how would you feel?

03:05.944 --> 03:08.080
I would feel bad,

03:08.817 --> 03:11.542
for you, for doing this.

03:13.402 --> 03:16.815
Then I would feel sad, too.

03:20.277 --> 03:21.913
I know I'm not...

03:23.198 --> 03:25.474
ready to be a father.

03:28.490 --> 03:33.325
Do you think that's how
Jesus would feel if he knew?

03:35.285 --> 03:39.288
I do.

03:42.197 --> 03:46.972
Am I horrible for not
telling Jesus before I do it?

03:50.800 --> 03:54.396
It's going to be a while...

03:54.972 --> 03:56.481
until he's well.

03:56.601 --> 04:00.519
And it's not like you can... wait.

04:04.501 --> 04:07.310
Emma. Why don't you come on back?

04:07.326 --> 04:08.927
We're gonna go into the
office and talk for a bit

04:08.927 --> 04:10.746
before you see the doctor.

05:03.223 --> 05:05.922
Today we're talking
about the biology of sex.

05:05.985 --> 05:08.007
The penis and the vagina.

05:08.290 --> 05:10.101
Intercourse, reproduction,

05:10.106 --> 05:12.483
how to use birth control
and practice safe sex.

05:12.513 --> 05:15.225
So, the boy and the girl
are ready to make love.

05:15.249 --> 05:17.931
The first thing to consider when
you're getting ready to have sex...

05:17.952 --> 05:19.257
Okay, next question.

05:19.702 --> 05:21.419
How long were you in solitary?

05:21.455 --> 05:22.871
Um, I'm not sure.

05:23.370 --> 05:24.772
About a day and a half.

05:26.093 --> 05:29.194
There aren't any windows or clocks, so,

05:29.230 --> 05:30.589
you lose track of time.

05:30.639 --> 05:33.043
Can't believe they're
allowed to do that to kids.

05:33.254 --> 05:37.523
Yeah, they can pretty
much do whatever they want.

05:37.704 --> 05:39.739
- At least for now anyway.
- Were you,

05:40.215 --> 05:41.110
like,

05:41.465 --> 05:43.447
abused in any of those
homes you were in?

05:43.643 --> 05:45.215
If any of these questions
are too personal,

05:45.224 --> 05:47.377
- you don't have to answer them, Callie.
- No, it's okay.

05:47.404 --> 05:49.184
Yeah, I was.

05:49.549 --> 05:52.290
Okay, I think we have
time for one more question.

05:53.220 --> 05:54.280
Talya.

05:55.098 --> 05:57.220
I don't have a question,
more of a comment.

05:58.385 --> 06:00.627
I always thought, like most people,

06:00.834 --> 06:02.861
that if someone got
arrested and went to jail

06:02.897 --> 06:04.299
then they probably did it,

06:04.419 --> 06:06.101
or did something bad.

06:06.115 --> 06:09.063
But innocent people get locked up...

06:09.221 --> 06:12.128
and I don't really
think there's any justice

06:12.133 --> 06:14.335
if we just put blind
faith in the system.

06:14.349 --> 06:17.423
So, thank you for opening my eyes.

06:17.688 --> 06:19.873
This is really amazing art,

06:20.214 --> 06:21.801
and you're very brave for sharing

06:21.805 --> 06:23.347
everything that's happened to you.

06:23.963 --> 06:25.644
I completely agree.

06:25.891 --> 06:28.318
It's wonderful work, Callie.

06:33.661 --> 06:35.904
All right, everyone make
sure that your projects

06:35.922 --> 06:39.068
are up and ready to go by
the morning for Open House.

06:44.278 --> 06:46.000
Hi. Ooh, hey.

06:46.031 --> 06:47.686
Heard you're getting a new roommate.

06:47.739 --> 06:49.883
- Hope she doesn't keep you up all night.
- Huh?

06:50.130 --> 06:51.218
Isabella?

06:51.515 --> 06:53.735
Ana and Isabella are moving
in with you guys, right?

06:53.855 --> 06:55.083
Where'd you hear that?

06:56.068 --> 06:57.250
My cousin told me.

06:58.249 --> 06:59.648
First I'm hearing about it.

07:00.872 --> 07:02.800
You know what, she's kind of an idiot.

07:02.832 --> 07:04.216
Forget I said anything.

07:07.120 --> 07:08.144
Hey!

07:08.535 --> 07:09.452
How'd it go?

07:09.771 --> 07:11.827
- Amazing.
- I told you.

07:12.964 --> 07:14.944
Do you think anyone's even
having sex in our grade?

07:15.475 --> 07:17.365
Um, I don't know.

07:18.510 --> 07:20.635
Are, um, you and Noah?

07:21.310 --> 07:23.827
Uh, not really.

07:24.708 --> 07:26.087
We almost did...

07:26.110 --> 07:27.548
but I've been grounded.

07:27.584 --> 07:29.553
So, when you're ungrounded?

07:29.580 --> 07:31.539
Are you guys gonna...

07:31.659 --> 07:33.848
- You know?
- I don't know.

07:35.185 --> 07:37.297
I wasn't so nervous when
we were getting high,

07:37.417 --> 07:40.965
but I promised my moms I
wouldn't do it anymore, so...

07:42.529 --> 07:43.653
It's just that

07:43.773 --> 07:45.513
Noah has had a lot of boyfriends,

07:45.531 --> 07:47.707
and I'm not really sure what to do.

07:48.242 --> 07:50.394
What about, like, watching porn?

07:50.514 --> 07:53.136
I tried that and it
sort of freaked me out.

07:54.061 --> 07:57.512
Plus, it's not like actually
doing something, you know?

07:57.548 --> 08:00.366
Well, why don't you do
like a practice hook-up?

08:00.486 --> 08:01.935
Is that a thing?

08:02.353 --> 08:04.678
Even Talya said nice things.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.196
Talya. Wow.

08:06.210 --> 08:08.403
- I know.
- Very cool. Very cool.

08:08.434 --> 08:09.936
- I'm so proud of you, honey.
- Thanks.

08:09.967 --> 08:12.678
I'm even kind of proud
of myself for once.

08:12.798 --> 08:15.182
Please do not say, "for once."

08:15.965 --> 08:17.295
Hey, um,

08:17.511 --> 08:19.987
have you guys heard anything
from Robert's lawyers?

08:20.055 --> 08:22.564
Not yet. But, you know,
these things take time.

08:23.346 --> 08:27.093
So if everyone involved in
the accident takes the money,

08:27.251 --> 08:28.698
then Callie gets off.

08:28.818 --> 08:31.142
Hey, did you see Emma today?

08:31.206 --> 08:32.660
Uh, yeah, at school.

08:32.683 --> 08:34.341
They say if all the parties agree...

08:34.373 --> 08:38.493
Did she look okay? Did she go home sick?

08:38.525 --> 08:40.143
So if you can buy
your way out of jail...

08:40.162 --> 08:41.547
does that mean Nick's gonna get out?

08:41.549 --> 08:43.405
Honey, she's been here
everyday since you got home.

08:43.442 --> 08:45.016
She must've been feeling pretty funky.

08:45.016 --> 08:46.252
- What if he does?
- Yeah.

08:46.279 --> 08:49.457
- I have no way of protecting myself.
- I'm pretty sure she'll be here tomorrow.

08:49.484 --> 08:51.901
Maybe you should take a
self-defense class or something.

08:51.919 --> 08:53.344
You both should. What do you say?

08:53.362 --> 08:55.097
- I'm good.
- No, seriously.

08:55.128 --> 08:57.083
I've taught self-defense
at the department.

08:57.097 --> 08:58.949
- I could show you guys a thing or two.
- No, thank you.

08:58.971 --> 09:00.998
I'm still traumatized from
you teaching me how to drive.

09:01.043 --> 09:03.034
- Come on, it'll be fun!
- Hey, Jude, how was health class?

09:03.043 --> 09:04.370
Mmm. Sex ed.

09:04.379 --> 09:06.185
Did you learn how to
put a condom on a banana?

09:06.774 --> 09:08.599
I'm pretty sure that's
ninth grade, actually.

09:08.630 --> 09:11.049
It was so slimy.

09:11.233 --> 09:13.741
Ew! All right! Enough.
Not a the dinner table.

09:13.741 --> 09:15.719
It was fine, I guess.

09:16.024 --> 09:18.096
Why don't they talk about gay sex?

09:18.330 --> 09:20.842
Um, I guess because it's controversial.

09:20.962 --> 09:22.801
Why? I mean...

09:22.833 --> 09:25.942
we have gay rights and
we have marriage equality.

09:26.787 --> 09:29.893
- So why don't we have gay sex ed?
- Yeah.

09:30.431 --> 09:32.013
You're right. We should.

09:34.507 --> 09:36.027
- You know, I was
- _

09:36.207 --> 09:38.311
- thinking, now that Jesus
- _

09:38.342 --> 09:40.477
can manage the steps...

09:40.999 --> 09:42.743
why doesn't he take my
room for a little bit?

09:42.904 --> 09:44.059
For real?

09:44.873 --> 09:47.745
Yeah, I mean, the hospital
bed's too big for your room.

09:49.331 --> 09:50.904
- That's very nice of you, B.
- _

09:50.931 --> 09:53.551
Yeah. Who are you and what
have you done with my brother?

09:53.569 --> 09:55.299
Excuse me a second.

09:57.398 --> 09:58.216
Hey!

09:58.265 --> 10:01.042
Sorry, I hope I'm not
interrupting dinner.

10:01.092 --> 10:03.757
No. It's okay. Everything all right?

10:03.877 --> 10:07.749
I wanted to talk to you
about Callie's senior project.

10:07.869 --> 10:10.357
Oh, yeah, I heard it was a huge success.

10:10.612 --> 10:14.428
Yeah. It was, and it's really great.

10:14.477 --> 10:16.069
But...

10:17.651 --> 10:21.270
I need it removed from
campus as soon as possible.

10:25.506 --> 10:27.184
This is great. Thank you.

10:27.482 --> 10:29.055
So, how was school today?

10:30.183 --> 10:31.329
It was good.

10:31.922 --> 10:33.235
It was good.

10:33.355 --> 10:34.367
So,

10:34.884 --> 10:36.749
when were you gonna tell
me y'all are moving in?

10:37.694 --> 10:38.732
Um...

10:39.208 --> 10:40.723
I was gonna talk to you about that.

10:40.894 --> 10:42.761
Only if it's okay with you.

10:44.516 --> 10:46.785
Of course it's okay with me.

10:46.808 --> 10:49.037
I could crash on the couch
if Bella needs my room.

10:49.060 --> 10:50.516
- No.
- AJ, no.

10:50.543 --> 10:51.990
No, of course not. The plan is for us

10:52.006 --> 10:55.227
to move in to the three bedroom
next door, if that's still available.

10:55.951 --> 10:57.142
Yeah, no, it is.

10:58.154 --> 10:59.947
Sorry to break up the bachelor pad.

11:07.803 --> 11:09.890
- Hey, I'm here. I'm ready.
- _

11:10.010 --> 11:12.391
Really, Mariana? Heels?

11:13.052 --> 11:14.009
What?

11:14.351 --> 11:16.576
You can't call a time-out
for a wardrobe change

11:16.580 --> 11:17.875
when you're getting attacked.

11:19.601 --> 11:21.355
Fair enough. Okay.

11:21.624 --> 11:22.910
Here we go. You ready?

11:23.030 --> 11:25.620
If you feel like you are in danger,

11:25.629 --> 11:28.824
stay around lots of people
and avoid isolated areas.

11:28.825 --> 11:30.838
Which you did not do at BayFest.

11:30.958 --> 11:32.294
Okay. Check.

11:32.362 --> 11:35.332
If you're being followed, you yell,

11:35.452 --> 11:37.746
"Leave me alone!" or
"Stop following me!"

11:37.791 --> 11:40.663
You wanna make people around
you aware of your problem.

11:40.690 --> 11:43.081
You do realize that I'm the
loudest in a family of seven.

11:43.112 --> 11:45.472
Yes, I'm well aware. So you
shouldn't have any problem

11:45.481 --> 11:47.494
with your most important tool,

11:47.732 --> 11:49.481
which is screaming.

11:49.601 --> 11:50.937
- Got it.
- Okay.

11:50.982 --> 11:53.431
- Let her rip. Let's hear one.
- Right now?

11:53.849 --> 11:55.329
It's nighttime. The
neighbors are going to think

11:55.338 --> 11:56.614
that someone's getting murdered.

11:56.734 --> 11:59.343
Okay, sweetheart, I know
that it's uncomfortable.

11:59.348 --> 12:03.024
As women, we are conditioned
to be passive and polite,

12:03.033 --> 12:07.177
and not to raise our voices, but
sometimes you gotta push on through.

12:07.249 --> 12:08.808
Okay, fine.

12:11.843 --> 12:13.443
I know you can do better than that.

12:13.478 --> 12:15.345
Okay, look, I know how to scream, okay?

12:15.380 --> 12:17.721
Can we get to the part where I
actually learn how to defend myself?

12:17.748 --> 12:20.917
Screaming is your best
defense, love. It...

12:22.301 --> 12:25.232
- Hello?
- Sorry, I just need to reply to this real quick.

12:26.504 --> 12:28.684
If and when you are ready
to take this seriously,

12:28.693 --> 12:30.135
go ahead and let me know.

12:30.255 --> 12:32.228
Otherwise, just please
don't waste my time.

12:35.237 --> 12:37.075
Hey!

12:37.534 --> 12:38.721
Where'd you go?

12:39.476 --> 12:40.931
I hope you remember you gave up

12:40.967 --> 12:43.044
when you're identifying
my body in a morgue.

12:48.931 --> 12:51.819
_

12:51.886 --> 12:54.246
_

12:57.482 --> 13:00.724
_

13:00.735 --> 13:03.999
_

13:04.119 --> 13:07.909
_

13:29.292 --> 13:30.955
You haven't played guitar in a while.

13:31.075 --> 13:32.991
Yeah, just, um...

13:33.026 --> 13:35.849
So much going on, I just haven't
really felt like it lately.

13:37.883 --> 13:41.466
So, listen, um, Monte called earlier,

13:41.693 --> 13:44.855
and she thinks your senior
project is incredible.

13:45.251 --> 13:46.249
Really?

13:46.940 --> 13:48.632
She called to tell you that?

13:48.685 --> 13:50.110
Yes, she did.

13:50.778 --> 13:53.534
And she also wanted me to talk to you.

13:54.340 --> 13:55.971
She has a request

13:55.998 --> 13:58.524
that I don't like, but
I sort of understand.

13:59.503 --> 14:02.519
She wants you to take it
down for the Open House.

14:02.830 --> 14:05.525
It's not a judgment or a
reflection on you at all.

14:05.561 --> 14:09.327
It's just that the Open House is
mostly for prospective families.

14:09.362 --> 14:11.849
And with attendance down
after the whole Nick situation,

14:11.876 --> 14:15.134
-  the lockdown...
- Yeah, you don't want families to think you've...

14:15.254 --> 14:17.044
got a bunch of delinquent students.

14:17.062 --> 14:19.727
We're just under a lot of pressure.
It's an accreditation year.

14:19.772 --> 14:21.461
I get it. It's okay.

14:22.917 --> 14:24.252
Are you sure?

14:24.522 --> 14:26.567
I mean, this was a huge win for you

14:26.581 --> 14:28.875
- and I really don't want to take that away.
- No, I know.

14:30.802 --> 14:32.476
But to be honest, I was

14:32.611 --> 14:35.942
starting to get anxious about
what parents might think anyway.

14:36.363 --> 14:38.554
Thank you, Callie.

14:54.240 --> 14:57.937
_

14:58.145 --> 15:00.201
_

15:06.653 --> 15:08.999
_

15:09.174 --> 15:12.162
_

15:12.398 --> 15:14.202
_

15:18.460 --> 15:20.955
_

15:26.697 --> 15:30.067
I'm so happy that AJ is
good with us moving in.

15:30.353 --> 15:33.061
Yeah, me, too.

15:39.730 --> 15:42.589
So, I was thinking, you know, uh...

15:42.954 --> 15:45.369
the three bedroom
only has one full bath.

15:45.594 --> 15:47.549
I mean, it's still kind of small.

15:48.538 --> 15:50.796
So, what I'm saying, is there's a...

15:50.916 --> 15:53.454
one-bedroom opening up down the hall.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.801
I was thinking that
might be better, I mean,

15:56.812 --> 15:58.889
you know, if you moved in
there, we'd have more bathrooms

15:58.903 --> 16:00.440
and more private space. I mean,

16:00.471 --> 16:02.628
we'd still basically
be all living together.

16:04.121 --> 16:05.172
What do you think?

16:05.878 --> 16:08.305
I think that it sounds like you

16:08.425 --> 16:10.701
don't want to live
with me, just near me.

16:11.744 --> 16:13.874
Mike, if you're getting
cold feet, I need to know.

16:13.882 --> 16:15.815
- I have Isabella.
- It's not that.

16:16.401 --> 16:18.519
I want to live with you and Isabella.

16:19.008 --> 16:20.365
I found out that,

16:20.922 --> 16:22.814
while I'm fostering AJ,

16:23.156 --> 16:24.594
you can't live with us.

16:25.353 --> 16:26.544
Why?

16:31.204 --> 16:32.699
'Cause of your felony.

16:36.589 --> 16:37.878
I'm sorry.

16:41.978 --> 16:43.933
We'd write PITA

16:43.982 --> 16:46.729
on the kid's file, so we'd know
they have a pain-in-the-ass parent.

16:46.770 --> 16:49.371
That's fantastic.

16:49.530 --> 16:51.434
Knock-knock.

16:52.076 --> 16:53.429
- Lena.
- Hey!

16:53.447 --> 16:54.957
Hey, what are you doing here?

16:54.970 --> 16:56.206
Well, Stef was with Jesus,

16:56.219 --> 16:58.704
so I thought I would come by and
talk with some of his teachers.

16:58.866 --> 17:00.264
Oh, you haven't met Drew.

17:00.336 --> 17:02.444
Drew Turner, this is Lena Adams Foster.

17:02.460 --> 17:03.966
I've heard so much about you.

17:03.989 --> 17:05.998
You've done an amazing
job here at Anchor Beach.

17:06.029 --> 17:07.085
Oh, thank you.

17:07.130 --> 17:09.665
And you have done an
amazing job with my office.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.781
Well, yeah, I hope it's okay.

17:11.801 --> 17:14.112
- Please, make yourself at home.
- Thanks.

17:14.152 --> 17:16.865
Oh, it's so good to
see you. We miss you.

17:17.219 --> 17:18.993
Oh, did you get a
chance to talk to Callie?

17:19.039 --> 17:21.242
I did, and she understands.

17:21.509 --> 17:23.806
But there is actually something
else I wanted to bring up.

17:24.048 --> 17:27.096
Jude was talking about
health class last night,

17:27.141 --> 17:29.559
and he brought up a very good point.

17:30.107 --> 17:32.036
Gays and lesbians are

17:32.395 --> 17:35.029
really left out of sex ed. Right?

17:35.069 --> 17:38.138
I mean, the whole LGBTQ
community is, in fact.

17:38.188 --> 17:40.553
And so, I thought, we
could talk to Arturo

17:40.598 --> 17:44.094
and maybe get him to design a
lesson plan that's more inclusive.

17:44.445 --> 17:46.431
How do you think that
would play with the parents?

17:46.466 --> 17:47.816
Not to mention the school board?

17:47.842 --> 17:50.066
Well, I think we would
need to educate them.

17:50.075 --> 17:54.822
Um, there was some debate about
doing this in my last school,

17:54.867 --> 17:57.114
and a group of parents got together,

17:57.137 --> 17:59.788
threatened to opt their kids
out of sex ed altogether,

18:00.089 --> 18:02.834
which, I think, puts kids at risk.

18:03.293 --> 18:06.196
Well, I think our LGBT kids
are at risk because no one

18:06.210 --> 18:07.882
is giving them the
information that they need.

18:07.918 --> 18:10.853
Jude's welcome to ask his
teacher questions after class.

18:10.862 --> 18:12.938
He won't, and neither will other kids

18:12.952 --> 18:14.925
who are confused or embarrassed or...

18:14.979 --> 18:16.916
afraid to out themselves.

18:17.275 --> 18:18.583
Like Sally Benton.

18:19.909 --> 18:22.511
Can you imagine the uproar
her parents would've made,

18:22.515 --> 18:25.451
if we taught their daughter how
to be a lesbian in Health class.

18:25.469 --> 18:27.793
That's ridiculous. That's
not what we'd be doing.

18:27.811 --> 18:29.847
But that's what some parents will think.

18:32.476 --> 18:35.420
Look, I appreciate your point
of view as a concerned parent,

18:35.429 --> 18:36.908
but with all due respect,

18:36.921 --> 18:39.645
you're on administrative
leave right now, so...

18:41.169 --> 18:43.560
that's the only point of
view you're entitled to.

18:46.190 --> 18:49.674
Try this. This... is... my... pat-tern.

18:49.728 --> 18:52.316
Play... it... back-to-me.

18:56.258 --> 18:59.624
Good job. Good. Hey.

18:59.674 --> 19:00.991
I'll be back.

19:01.014 --> 19:04.672
- Uh, I hope this is okay.
- Oh, I said you could come anytime.

19:04.792 --> 19:07.717
You know, I was doing some
of the stuff with my brother

19:07.717 --> 19:09.082
and it seems to be really helping him.

19:09.122 --> 19:10.330
- That's great.
- Yeah.

19:10.380 --> 19:13.907
- Uh, so are these kids...
- They have autism.

19:13.995 --> 19:15.502
And music helps them?

19:15.508 --> 19:17.362
Well, music is a non-verbal language.

19:17.398 --> 19:18.913
So, the kids make music

19:18.927 --> 19:21.295
and I can connect with them
by answering back musically.

19:21.301 --> 19:23.134
- That's really cool.
- Yeah.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.470
Is there anything I can do to help?

19:25.506 --> 19:28.020
Um, it would be a huge help if you can

19:28.038 --> 19:30.509
- put away any loose instruments.
- Sure.

19:48.176 --> 19:51.063
This... is... my... pat-tern.

19:51.144 --> 19:54.092
Play... it... back... to... me.

19:56.101 --> 19:57.499
Go.

19:57.543 --> 19:59.076
No, it's okay. You can do it.

19:59.099 --> 20:00.897
You can do it. Here you go.

20:00.928 --> 20:02.766
Hey, hey, hey. Oli,
it's okay. It's okay.

20:02.779 --> 20:05.485
Do you want some time?
Do you want your fidget?

20:05.605 --> 20:07.315
Yeah, there you go.

20:07.630 --> 20:09.212
Good job, Oli.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.783
You don't touch a child with autism.

20:11.806 --> 20:13.186
- I didn't know.
- Exactly.

20:13.199 --> 20:14.269
You're here to observe,

20:14.296 --> 20:16.570
- and if you can't do that...
- I'm sorry, I...

20:18.399 --> 20:20.148
Maybe I shouldn't be here at all.

20:23.610 --> 20:26.006
- Thank you for helping me.
- Mmm-hmm.

20:26.126 --> 20:28.325
I'm guessing Aaron wasn't available.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.207
Ha-ha!

20:31.636 --> 20:34.719
So, did you hear? Ana and the baby
are moving in with me and Mike?

20:34.746 --> 20:36.018
- No.
- Yeah.

20:36.077 --> 20:38.544
I guess we're gonna move into
that three-bedroom in our building.

20:38.664 --> 20:40.643
Great.

20:40.701 --> 20:43.034
I have such fond memories
of that master closet.

20:43.052 --> 20:45.825
Hey! Mike told me he
loves you like family.

20:46.845 --> 20:49.884
And he wants to adopt me.

20:50.069 --> 20:51.192
He does?

20:53.062 --> 20:54.415
What do you think?

20:54.959 --> 20:56.245
I wouldn't mind.

20:56.365 --> 20:58.449
Mike's been good to me, but...

20:59.916 --> 21:02.029
I don't know how Ty would feel about it.

21:02.149 --> 21:03.732
You know, him being a white cop and all.

21:03.799 --> 21:06.176
I thought Ty was glad that
you had Mike looking after you.

21:06.181 --> 21:07.201
Yeah, but

21:07.569 --> 21:09.673
fostering is different than adopting.

21:09.700 --> 21:12.105
I just... I'd want
him to be cool with it.

21:12.225 --> 21:14.931
If it's what you want,
then he should be.

21:15.355 --> 21:16.613
I think you should ask him.

21:16.915 --> 21:17.854
Hey.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.834
- What are you doing?
- Uh, we are taking this down.

21:20.875 --> 21:22.695
Why? The Open House is tomorrow.

21:22.709 --> 21:24.030
Yeah, that's the point.

21:24.150 --> 21:25.856
Monte doesn't think that

21:25.923 --> 21:29.685
my project is appropriate for
prospective families, so...

21:29.755 --> 21:31.944
Are you serious? That's total BS.

21:34.124 --> 21:36.299
I finally got my own room.

21:36.308 --> 21:38.699
I should've nailed
myself in the head sooner.

21:39.872 --> 21:41.306
Not funny.

21:41.917 --> 21:43.328
You know what is funny?

21:44.092 --> 21:48.933
Brandon having to
share a room with Jude.

21:49.931 --> 21:52.618
I think it's very sweet
that he gave you his room.

21:52.847 --> 21:54.933
- You might be a little grateful.
- Okay.

21:57.072 --> 21:58.955
Slow your roll there, Foster.

21:59.939 --> 22:02.735
You wanna help me with some...

22:03.283 --> 22:05.067
physical therapy?

22:06.231 --> 22:08.676
I don't know if you're up for that.

22:08.680 --> 22:11.736
Oh, no, no, no. I'm up.

22:12.024 --> 22:16.828
- You wanna see?
- Not what I meant. Are you sure it's safe?

22:17.579 --> 22:20.531
Uh, yeah. Yeah. I'll wear my helmet.

22:23.732 --> 22:25.013
Your family's here.

22:25.053 --> 22:27.489
I don't want anybody walking in on us.

22:28.253 --> 22:29.273
Are you hungry?

22:29.354 --> 22:30.711
Why don't I make you a sandwich?

22:51.136 --> 22:52.879
_

22:52.924 --> 22:55.814
_

22:59.248 --> 23:01.365
_

23:04.295 --> 23:06.749
_

23:21.958 --> 23:23.271
Did you get the books I sent you?

23:23.325 --> 23:26.624
Yeah. Thanks. They really
help pass the time here.

23:26.643 --> 23:28.761
- You been staying out of trouble?
- Hell, yeah.

23:28.828 --> 23:31.429
Been keeping my head down.

23:31.800 --> 23:34.252
- How about you?
- I'm doing good.

23:35.005 --> 23:36.453
Getting good grades.

23:37.223 --> 23:38.758
Uh, so,

23:39.595 --> 23:41.860
I wanted to talk to you about...

23:42.028 --> 23:44.765
- you know, my situation.
- Yeah. Yeah, me, too.

23:45.304 --> 23:48.534
My PO is saying, "You'll be
out of here in a few months."

23:48.654 --> 23:50.961
- For real?
- Told you, I've been doing good.

23:51.388 --> 23:53.904
Plus, I get these credits
that shorten my sentence

23:53.926 --> 23:55.595
for the courses I've
been taking in here.

23:55.629 --> 23:58.202
- Like what?
- I'm in firefighter training.

23:58.410 --> 24:01.663
That's got me thinking about
doing that once I get out.

24:02.146 --> 24:04.140
You know, do something to help people.

24:04.260 --> 24:07.584
Anyway, I'm gonna get a
job, as soon as I'm out.

24:07.781 --> 24:09.123
And you're gonna be 18.

24:09.145 --> 24:11.196
So you can move in with
me, just like we planned.

24:11.269 --> 24:12.938
You can go to college if you want.

24:13.253 --> 24:15.988
I'm gonna take care
of the rent, all that.

24:17.285 --> 24:18.769
Yeah, yeah. That all...

24:18.983 --> 24:20.477
That sounds good, man.

24:24.258 --> 24:25.758
Oh. Hey.

24:25.878 --> 24:27.152
Hey.

24:30.247 --> 24:31.314
I'm sorry.

24:33.797 --> 24:35.404
How, uh...

24:36.636 --> 24:39.036
- How're you feeling?
- I'm okay.

24:39.071 --> 24:40.434
Yeah, you sure?

24:40.773 --> 24:41.973
Yeah.

24:43.876 --> 24:46.524
Your brother wants to...

24:46.535 --> 24:47.513
What?

24:48.581 --> 24:49.693
Oh.

24:49.813 --> 24:52.283
- Sorry.
- No.

24:52.317 --> 24:54.732
I told him he's
probably not well enough.

24:54.733 --> 24:55.817
Right.

24:56.328 --> 24:59.069
And I'm not...

24:59.980 --> 25:01.491
No, of course.

25:03.042 --> 25:04.628
Sorry, it's just that...

25:05.642 --> 25:07.272
nobody else knows.

25:07.845 --> 25:09.986
Uh, well, that's okay.

25:10.031 --> 25:11.496
You know, um...

25:11.616 --> 25:15.754
I'm not exactly, like...

25:16.007 --> 25:18.608
qualified or anything, but...

25:19.855 --> 25:21.754
if you ever...

25:21.956 --> 25:25.052
you know, need to talk about
it or anything, I'm always...

25:25.085 --> 25:27.243
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

25:30.833 --> 25:32.209
Jesus.

25:34.434 --> 25:36.243
_

25:38.019 --> 25:40.227
_

25:40.347 --> 25:41.806
Emma sent...

25:41.856 --> 25:46.019
"Was just talking to
Brandon. Be right up."

25:46.139 --> 25:47.946
Would you like to reply?

25:53.249 --> 25:55.502
_

26:00.755 --> 26:02.227
Hey!

26:02.266 --> 26:03.558
Are you crazy?

26:03.598 --> 26:05.075
Exactly the scream I'm
talking about, right there.

26:05.114 --> 26:07.136
- Mariana, where are you going?
- What is going on?

26:07.171 --> 26:08.907
What? Nothing.

26:09.558 --> 26:11.733
I'm just trying to get her to take
this a little bit more seriously.

26:11.767 --> 26:13.508
- Why did she scream?
- 'Cause I

26:13.581 --> 26:16.044
- jumped out from behind the tree.
- You scared her?

26:16.061 --> 26:17.760
Yeah. She's been giving
me a lot of attitude,

26:17.777 --> 26:18.955
- a little resistance.
- Go.

26:18.983 --> 26:20.853
- What?
- Go talk to her. Say you're sorry.

26:20.865 --> 26:22.129
Oh, come on, she's being silly.

26:22.140 --> 26:24.050
She's not you, okay. She
didn't play with G.I. Joes.

26:24.089 --> 26:26.730
She grew up wearing princess dresses
and wanting to live in a castle.

26:26.763 --> 26:28.471
Okay, I find that a little
sexist, Lena, I gotta be honest.

26:28.499 --> 26:30.656
- You know, even princesses can learn to fight.
- Agreed.

26:30.673 --> 26:33.965
But you don't teach them the
same way you would teach a Marine.

26:35.033 --> 26:37.426
Fine.

26:37.612 --> 26:40.292
No problem. I'll go talk to her. Happy?

26:41.224 --> 26:43.342
Stupid princesses.

27:09.534 --> 27:10.949
It's open.

27:30.372 --> 27:31.838
You're Jacob?

27:47.227 --> 27:49.452
I'm sorry that I scared you.

27:49.924 --> 27:51.297
No, you're not.

27:52.143 --> 27:53.941
Yes, I am.

27:54.587 --> 27:56.419
I'm not sorry that I made you scream.

27:56.475 --> 27:58.104
Yeah, well, screaming's awful.

27:58.127 --> 27:59.919
It's really upsetting. What's the point?

27:59.964 --> 28:02.874
The point is to scare
your attacker, love.

28:02.902 --> 28:05.779
To draw attention to him,
so hopefully he runs away.

28:05.830 --> 28:08.948
So should I have screamed
when Nick was in my bedroom?

28:10.078 --> 28:13.184
No, in that situation, no.

28:14.696 --> 28:16.606
And you know, I think...

28:17.027 --> 28:20.517
I think the way you handled
it was pretty brilliant. I do.

28:21.820 --> 28:23.489
I wasn't handling it.

28:23.725 --> 28:26.820
- What do you mean?
- I was so scared that I was frozen.

28:28.421 --> 28:31.124
Maybe at first, but you
know what, you were the one

28:31.141 --> 28:33.669
that talked him out of
hurting you and himself.

28:33.692 --> 28:35.692
You got him to put that gun down.

28:38.384 --> 28:40.968
I just don't want to relive it at all.

28:42.434 --> 28:46.063
I hear you, baby, I hear you. I
understand that, but listen to me,

28:46.063 --> 28:48.080
you know, fear sometimes
is a good thing.

28:48.080 --> 28:51.092
When we can use that adrenalin
to fight or take flight...

28:51.378 --> 28:53.508
you can't freeze when someone grabs you

28:53.519 --> 28:54.590
and you're certainly
not going to be able

28:54.595 --> 28:56.222
to talk your way out of an attack.

28:59.162 --> 29:00.668
It's like...

29:01.805 --> 29:03.895
if Snow White was...

29:04.591 --> 29:06.806
If Snow White was in the forest and...

29:07.705 --> 29:11.067
the dwarves were nearby, but they
weren't keeping their eyes on her.

29:11.408 --> 29:14.351
- And the witch, she...
- The evil queen.

29:15.790 --> 29:17.183
It's the evil queen?

29:17.303 --> 29:19.583
Okay, the evil queen, just kind of,

29:19.632 --> 29:22.490
- jumps out of nowhere and grabs her...
- Okay, wait.

29:22.530 --> 29:24.679
Why are we talking
about a Disney princess?

29:25.232 --> 29:28.396
Well, she's a badass...

29:28.477 --> 29:29.412
Like that?

29:29.821 --> 29:31.502
Yeah, Mariana, like that.

29:31.865 --> 29:34.405
Now that I'm deaf in one ear.

29:36.040 --> 29:37.541
Oh, you think you're funny?

29:37.582 --> 29:38.835
Oh, I know I'm funny.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.962
Oh, you know you're funny?

29:40.998 --> 29:43.969
You're a little punk is
what you are, you little...

29:45.672 --> 29:48.252
- Is this all of it?
- Callie?

29:48.778 --> 29:49.519
Hey.

29:49.542 --> 29:52.077
- Are you behind this boycott at the Open House?
- No.

29:52.104 --> 29:53.353
What boycott?

29:54.086 --> 29:57.912
Some of the seniors are refusing
to put up their senior projects.

29:57.921 --> 30:00.254
And they're pressuring
other students not to attend.

30:00.307 --> 30:02.663
- Why?
- Because they made me take mine down.

30:02.676 --> 30:05.216
So if you had nothing to do
with this, do you know who does?

30:06.475 --> 30:08.338
- No.
- If I find out otherwise...

30:08.349 --> 30:09.692
Don't threaten my daughter.

30:09.812 --> 30:11.456
If she says she's not a
part of this, she's not.

30:11.484 --> 30:14.186
Right. Because this would be the
first time she's ever lied to you.

30:17.129 --> 30:19.225
Look, if the seniors don't show up,

30:19.455 --> 30:24.005
the school, your kids' school
and our jobs are at stake.

30:28.893 --> 30:30.640
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

30:30.668 --> 30:32.101
This is not your fault.

30:32.921 --> 30:34.349
It's my fault. I never
should've asked you

30:34.349 --> 30:36.149
to take your project down to begin with.

30:36.316 --> 30:38.166
I should've fought for you and I'm

30:38.211 --> 30:40.364
actually really proud
that your classmates are.

30:40.392 --> 30:42.006
I don't want to hurt the school.

30:42.361 --> 30:43.979
You know what? That's on Monte.

30:44.204 --> 30:45.758
She could always change her mind.

30:46.675 --> 30:49.003
Actually, I do have an idea.

30:49.601 --> 30:52.010
But I don't think
Monte's going to like it.

30:54.909 --> 30:57.210
- Just have to leave a little early for school.
- Yeah.

30:57.434 --> 31:00.081
Hey, Callie, can I talk
with your mom alone, please?

31:00.158 --> 31:02.230
- Okay.
- Thanks, hon.

31:07.178 --> 31:09.035
Have you... Have you seen this?

31:09.740 --> 31:11.309
What is this? What is Pump?

31:11.318 --> 31:13.675
It's an app for gay men
to hook up with each other.

31:13.795 --> 31:14.928
Who downloaded this?

31:15.048 --> 31:17.630
There's only one gay
man on our family plan.

31:17.827 --> 31:19.144
Boy, you mean?

31:20.602 --> 31:21.616
Where is Jude?

31:21.625 --> 31:24.097
He said he was going
to Taylor's to study.

31:26.808 --> 31:27.809
Hey!

31:28.668 --> 31:31.203
- What's going on?
- I don't know, bud. You tell me.

31:31.225 --> 31:32.974
Did you download this app?

31:35.583 --> 31:36.421
Pump?

31:37.262 --> 31:38.291
What's that?

31:40.121 --> 31:41.532
May I please have your phone, Jude?

31:42.992 --> 31:44.435
Now, Jude.

31:51.059 --> 31:53.123
So you went to meet this man that you

31:53.123 --> 31:55.339
met on an app at his apartment?

31:56.489 --> 31:59.416
Jude, we need to know
everything that happened.

31:59.536 --> 32:01.533
- We're not going to judge.
- Nothing.

32:03.587 --> 32:04.723
He got mad.

32:05.609 --> 32:07.424
I told him I was 18.

32:07.910 --> 32:09.393
And he didn't believe me.

32:09.513 --> 32:11.803
So he told me to get out.

32:13.030 --> 32:15.771
- You're telling us the truth?
- Yes.

32:15.891 --> 32:18.486
- I promise.
- Honey, why were you crying?

32:19.582 --> 32:20.949
Because I was scared.

32:22.387 --> 32:23.961
Being in his apartment,

32:24.081 --> 32:26.716
he thought I was trying
to get him arrested.

32:27.170 --> 32:31.098
Then why did you go there
in the first place, bud?

32:31.376 --> 32:33.062
'Cause I didn't know what to do.

32:35.178 --> 32:36.540
For sex.

32:37.673 --> 32:39.201
They don't talk about it in Health.

32:39.321 --> 32:40.990
And I don't have anyone to ask.

32:41.178 --> 32:44.783
Jude, you are 14. You don't
need to know what to do.

32:44.814 --> 32:47.485
- You're too young to be having sex.
- Okay,

32:47.605 --> 32:48.761
it's true, but...

32:48.784 --> 32:53.593
we teach straight kids what to do
at 14, you know, just in case...

32:54.393 --> 32:56.164
and we advise them to wait,

32:56.635 --> 32:59.493
but they have questions
and we give them answers.

32:59.696 --> 33:02.203
Where do LGBT kids go for answers?

33:02.257 --> 33:03.462
Not to an app,

33:03.669 --> 33:07.174
where you could meet
strangers who could hurt you.

33:08.185 --> 33:11.789
Do you have any idea how much danger
you put yourself in there, Jude?

33:14.612 --> 33:16.729
What if he raped you, buddy?

33:16.756 --> 33:18.949
There are so many what-ifs.

33:18.998 --> 33:20.482
Each worse than the other.

33:20.505 --> 33:23.835
I know that you have
better judgment than this.

33:23.853 --> 33:26.024
Honey, we want you, when you're ready,

33:26.428 --> 33:27.965
and hopefully, when you're older,

33:28.576 --> 33:30.823
to have positive sexual experiences,

33:31.053 --> 33:33.418
not ones that could scar you for life.

33:36.573 --> 33:38.114
Hey, listen.

33:39.278 --> 33:42.092
Enough of the lecture. Just please...

33:42.380 --> 33:45.611
promise us you'll never do
anything like this ever again.

33:47.444 --> 33:49.040
- I promise.
- Okay.

34:03.981 --> 34:06.948
_

34:08.335 --> 34:09.549
What's this?

34:10.741 --> 34:12.867
Well, if we can't teach
our kids on campus,

34:12.889 --> 34:15.284
I'm gonna make sure they
get informed off campus.

34:15.304 --> 34:16.400
Fair enough.

34:17.581 --> 34:19.172
So, good news.

34:19.877 --> 34:22.273
The seniors backed down.
They're showing their projects.

34:22.344 --> 34:24.920
So, all's well that ends well.

34:25.951 --> 34:27.456
Can I talk to you?

34:32.154 --> 34:34.188
Oh, good. Good job, McKenna.

34:39.779 --> 34:43.797
Uh, so, listen. I'm sorry, I...

34:44.216 --> 34:46.264
I overstepped last time, and...

34:46.319 --> 34:49.254
I'm here to observe if you'll have me.

34:49.649 --> 34:53.083
And I promise I'll hang back,
you won't even know I'm here.

34:53.909 --> 34:55.286
Sounds good.

35:10.794 --> 35:12.776
How do you think this
is going to go down?

35:13.347 --> 35:14.650
I'm not sure.

35:18.196 --> 35:19.391
Uh-oh.

35:24.525 --> 35:26.159
What the hell is this?

35:26.194 --> 35:28.858
Well, you didn't want Callie
to show her project on campus,

35:28.899 --> 35:30.853
this is how she got the
seniors to back down.

35:31.566 --> 35:33.325
Showing it off campus.

35:34.534 --> 35:35.919
All's well that ends well, right?

35:44.596 --> 35:47.239
So, clearly I'm a disaster,

35:47.243 --> 35:50.565
and the universe is telling
me that this is not my thing.

35:50.745 --> 35:52.237
Come on.

35:54.269 --> 35:55.806
How did Oli do today?

35:55.820 --> 35:58.006
He had a really big breakthrough.

35:58.741 --> 35:59.964
He laughed.

36:01.038 --> 36:02.341
He did?

36:02.880 --> 36:04.502
And you can thank Brandon,

36:04.622 --> 36:06.354
he's the one that made it happen.

36:06.983 --> 36:08.368
Thank you...

36:10.313 --> 36:11.585
so much.

36:11.705 --> 36:13.090
Yeah, you're welcome.

36:14.407 --> 36:16.524
Bye, Oli. See you later.

36:20.577 --> 36:23.634
The real goal when working
with kids with autism,

36:23.697 --> 36:25.197
is to connect with them,

36:25.260 --> 36:28.276
but to also help them
connect with their feelings.

36:28.352 --> 36:31.004
And that's what you did for Oli.

36:31.251 --> 36:33.194
You should feel really good about that.

36:34.191 --> 36:37.544
But you can't just bail every
single time you get embarrassed

36:37.553 --> 36:40.025
or have a bad session
with the patient, because

36:40.145 --> 36:43.954
there are plenty of
those days, too. Trust me.

36:45.343 --> 36:48.624
Oh, and you should also
watch where you're going.

36:51.334 --> 36:53.015
I just couldn't bring it up.

36:53.420 --> 36:55.721
You know, he's so
excited about getting out,

36:55.784 --> 36:57.415
and us getting a place together.

36:58.679 --> 37:00.719
Well, he wants to be a firefighter.

37:02.427 --> 37:04.414
Okay, but what do you want?

37:06.055 --> 37:07.637
I don't want to hurt Mike.

37:09.178 --> 37:12.280
But then I feel like it's worse
if I hurt my brother, you know.

37:12.680 --> 37:14.092
You think he'll understand?

37:14.568 --> 37:15.660
Mike?

37:16.393 --> 37:17.723
He'll understand.

37:18.295 --> 37:19.477
Excuse me.

37:20.434 --> 37:23.216
Are you the student responsible
for the art installation?

37:23.931 --> 37:25.194
Yes.

37:25.252 --> 37:26.897
I'm here with my son for the Open House.

37:26.915 --> 37:29.374
But I'm a professor at San
Diego School of Art and Design.

37:29.621 --> 37:31.882
Are you planning on going to art school?

37:32.759 --> 37:36.090
- Uh, I don't know.
- Well, if you are,

37:36.210 --> 37:38.422
I certainly hope you'll
consider applying with us.

37:38.462 --> 37:40.366
It's a really powerful piece.

37:46.075 --> 37:47.676
That's great.

37:47.862 --> 37:50.817
You're doing better than
me. Let's try again. Okay?

37:51.025 --> 37:52.199
Hey!

37:53.059 --> 37:54.699
Why aren't you at the Open House?

37:54.699 --> 37:57.845
I made an appearance,
just a very brief one.

37:58.160 --> 38:01.244
You know what, let's try
to change the key this time.

38:01.364 --> 38:03.065
G major.

38:03.655 --> 38:06.475
So it's still just all
white keys for this song.

38:06.475 --> 38:07.919
I'm done.

38:08.481 --> 38:10.312
Piano's too hard.

38:12.098 --> 38:14.216
Come on, everything's hard
when you're first learning it.

38:14.256 --> 38:17.957
- Yeah, that's not an excuse to give up.
- Why don't you two just get a room, huh?

38:18.281 --> 38:20.721
- What are you talking about?
- What? Did you think I'm stupid?

38:21.071 --> 38:22.276
You're screwing my brother.

38:22.289 --> 38:23.678
- No, she's not.
- That is not true.

38:23.691 --> 38:25.848
That's why you don't want sex with me.

38:25.871 --> 38:28.491
- Jesus!
- Of course, you want Brandon. I mean, he's smart.

38:28.611 --> 38:29.893
- Right?
- You gotta calm down

38:29.925 --> 38:31.606
or else you're gonna have a seizure.

38:31.726 --> 38:33.917
Hey, hey, hey! What is going on in here?

38:33.939 --> 38:35.849
- You and Mama know!
- What?

38:35.885 --> 38:38.075
You want Brandon to have her

38:38.097 --> 38:39.756
because you always want

38:39.769 --> 38:42.291
-  Brandon to have everything!
- Hey! Hey! Shh!

38:42.313 --> 38:44.663
Okay, enough. Brandon and
Mariana, upstairs, please now.

38:44.663 --> 38:45.634
Come on, let's go.

38:45.697 --> 38:47.252
Hey, look at me, look at me.

38:47.372 --> 38:49.791
Hey, Emma, sweetheart, I think
that Jesus needs a little rest.

38:49.805 --> 38:51.382
So why don't you head
home for a bit, okay, baby?

38:51.382 --> 38:52.573
Right, of course.

38:52.870 --> 38:56.277
Hey, calm down, okay. Calm down.

38:56.322 --> 38:58.786
Are you okay? Jesus?

38:59.312 --> 39:01.317
You okay? Jesus?

39:05.078 --> 39:07.586
Oh, my baby, talk to me.

39:08.917 --> 39:10.004
Oh, baby.

39:15.689 --> 39:17.428
- Is it true?
- No.

39:17.433 --> 39:19.499
I saw the way that you guys
were looking at each other.

39:19.517 --> 39:21.710
- Something's going on.
- There's nothing going on.

39:21.741 --> 39:22.935
I don't believe you.

39:22.970 --> 39:25.194
- Maybe Mom can get it out of you.
- Mariana, no,

39:25.212 --> 39:28.138
it's none of your business. For once
in your life, just stay out of it.

39:30.677 --> 39:33.611
Oh, my God. Emma's pregnant?

39:33.647 --> 39:36.145
She's pregnant, isn't she?
That's it. She's pregnant.

39:36.168 --> 39:38.550
Shh. No, she isn't pregnant.

39:42.121 --> 39:43.221
Anymore.

39:52.370 --> 39:53.961
You don't gotta hang around.

39:54.127 --> 39:55.700
I can watch her till they get home.

39:55.735 --> 39:57.157
That's sweet, but

39:57.350 --> 40:00.186
I don't want to miss a
moment with my grand baby.

40:00.200 --> 40:02.773
Oh, yeah, you must be sad
they're moving in with us.

40:02.808 --> 40:04.175
You're gonna miss 'em.

40:04.210 --> 40:06.891
So that's happening?
You're getting adopted?

40:07.175 --> 40:08.236
What do you mean?

40:08.721 --> 40:11.400
They wouldn't let her move in
here while Mike was fostering you.

40:12.021 --> 40:15.213
I know that she has a felony,
but she is not a bad influence.

40:16.116 --> 40:18.435
Well, now that he's adopting
you, that won't be an issue.

40:19.618 --> 40:22.058
Now we just have to get them married.

40:28.350 --> 40:30.579
_

40:30.589 --> 40:33.439
_

40:41.751 --> 40:44.447
- Hello!
- In here.

40:45.654 --> 40:47.560
We have an announcement.

40:48.050 --> 40:50.753
Miss Callie is being
scouted by an art school.

40:50.789 --> 40:52.455
She just asked me to apply.

40:53.416 --> 40:54.868
Hey, Robert.

40:54.926 --> 40:56.095
Hey.

40:56.931 --> 40:58.131
What's wrong?

41:02.665 --> 41:05.488
Troy Johnson won't take
the settlement deal.

41:05.991 --> 41:08.697
We tried everything we can. He
doesn't care about the money, so...

41:10.171 --> 41:11.506
we're going to trial.
