WEBVTT

00:53.000 --> 00:54.979
(Coachman urges on horses)

00:57.240 --> 00:59.424
(Birdsong)

01:00.440 --> 01:02.419
(Approaching hoof beats)

01:13.120 --> 01:16.260
JEREMY: How far is London?
ROSS: Hundreds of miles.

01:16.440 --> 01:18.499
DEMELZA: Feels like the ends of the earth.

01:19.520 --> 01:21.499
And perhaps that's no bad thing.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.265
The headaches grow worse -
but if you give me a stronger opiate...

01:30.440 --> 01:33.819
It's not simply a question of dulling the pain,
but of treating the underlying cause.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.024
(Door opens)

01:35.200 --> 01:37.418
This is a sorry sight!

01:37.600 --> 01:40.660
My nephew should be up,
preparing for the election.

01:40.840 --> 01:44.139
If we prevail - as I hope we shall -
we leave at once for London.

01:44.320 --> 01:46.220
My Lord, may I have a word?

01:46.400 --> 01:50.905
You are aware that the election is next week?
My nephew must be recovered by then.

01:51.680 --> 01:54.581
I regret that I cannot tell you
what you wish to hear.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.577
Then perhaps I should ﬁnd someone who can.

02:03.120 --> 02:06.305
GEORGE: Do we think here, or Truro,
for the celebrations?

02:07.160 --> 02:08.502
My return to Parliament?

02:08.680 --> 02:11.103
ELIZABETH: Are you so confident?
It was close last time.

02:11.280 --> 02:15.387
With a man like Basset behind me,
do you suppose the result's in any doubt?

02:16.720 --> 02:18.984
Now...Armitage. Armitage puzzles me.

02:19.160 --> 02:20.707
An illustrious family name,

02:20.880 --> 02:22.381
a respectable Navy career,

02:22.560 --> 02:24.425
no local business interests to further.

02:24.600 --> 02:27.057
What possible use
could he make of Parliament?

02:27.240 --> 02:29.504
Perhaps he thinks to be "a force for good"?

02:30.280 --> 02:32.498
- He wouldn't last five minutes!
- Hm.

02:32.680 --> 02:33.942
(Chatter)

02:50.760 --> 02:53.467
ROSS: Dwight!
You've missed all the hard work.

02:53.640 --> 02:56.905
I was called to Tregothnan.
And subsequently dismissed.

02:57.080 --> 02:58.661
- Hugh's improved?
- The reverse.

02:58.840 --> 03:01.479
But Falmouth dislikes my diagnosis
so has called in Choake.

03:01.640 --> 03:05.269
Then there's no hope for him.
He'd stand a better chance in France.

03:05.440 --> 03:08.500
Ha. And I have other patients to attend to.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.227
Some closer to home.

03:13.000 --> 03:17.425
I very much regret to announce
an Enys-Penvenen offshoot.

03:18.320 --> 03:19.947
A Child?

03:20.120 --> 03:21.587
Oh, Judas, that's wonderful!

03:21.760 --> 03:23.182
(Laughter)

03:23.360 --> 03:26.386
And entirely your fault.
You would insist on bringing me home.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.505
- Of course I don't want the brat.
- She don't mean it.

03:28.680 --> 03:31.137
- No, she means it.
- Really, I cannot bear babies.

03:31.320 --> 03:35.381
- Wrinkled, greedy, red-faced little tyrants!
- Truly, though...

03:35.560 --> 03:37.585
Will it not be wonderful for us all?

03:38.920 --> 03:42.378
- This calls for a celebration.
- Well, before my life is ambushed by possets,

03:42.560 --> 03:44.221
I must make myself useful.

03:44.400 --> 03:47.380
Will you favour me
with your company this afternoon?

03:48.720 --> 03:52.065
Well, stap me, if it ain't the Resurrection Boys!

03:52.760 --> 03:54.739
(Mimics choking)

03:55.360 --> 03:58.705
Ahh, now then, lads - do 'ee wrastle?

03:58.880 --> 04:03.749
I'm in charge of the games at Sawle Feast
tomorrow, and in need of contenders.

04:04.400 --> 04:09.667
I'll fight either of you Came meaders
wi' one hand tied behind my back!

04:11.120 --> 04:14.066
Why don't you fight 'im, Sam?
Show them who's master!

04:14.240 --> 04:17.585
- I'd sooner wrestle for the liberation of souls.
- What about my soul?

04:18.760 --> 04:20.500
I pray for that night an' day.

04:21.280 --> 04:24.067
And if you came to our meetings,
we could pray together.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.303
Maybe I would - if you beat him.

04:29.480 --> 04:31.459
TOM HARRY: Hmm...

04:33.840 --> 04:36.980
- Do 'ee mean it?
- I say so, don't I?

04:42.160 --> 04:44.139
I accept.

04:50.240 --> 04:53.824
CAROLINE: Would it not be a fine thing
if George Warleggan were unseated...

04:55.000 --> 04:57.184
- Yes.
- By Hugh Armitage?

05:00.160 --> 05:04.460
For then George would be out of Parliament.
And Hugh would be out of Cornwall.

05:05.760 --> 05:08.422
It would solve a good many problems.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.579
So how may we help Hugh on his way?

05:11.640 --> 05:13.221
Hm?

05:17.560 --> 05:22.338
Our aim is to bring down the fever,
reduce the putrid humours

05:22.520 --> 05:25.819
and _cause an intermission in the
excessrve action of the blood vessels.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.309
We will proceed first with blistering,

05:28.480 --> 05:32.507
thereafter with purging, vomiting,
poulticing and bleeding.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.588
(Chatter)

05:41.960 --> 05:45.782
If you were to bring your influence to bear
in securing me the living of St Newlyn,

05:45.960 --> 05:50.101
my uncle, Conan Godolphin, might be willing...

05:50.280 --> 05:52.498
To secure me an introduction
to the Prince of Wales?

05:52.680 --> 05:56.138
Yes, you've said so - many times -
so far without...result.

06:00.320 --> 06:05.383
But...as you say,
were I in a position to influence matters -

06:05.560 --> 06:07.460
your uncle should bear that in mind...

06:07.640 --> 06:10.279
when next he dines with His Royal Highness.

06:10.440 --> 06:14.319
- Is this what it takes to be a politician?
- See how well suited I'd be?

06:15.840 --> 06:18.400
So delighted you could join us,
my Lord de Dunstanville.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.425
The delight is all mine, dear ladies.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.059
Lord Falmouth is here, ma'am.

06:28.440 --> 06:29.941
Oh. Oh, dear.

06:30.120 --> 06:32.497
- How very awloNard!
- Has he mistook the day?

06:32.680 --> 06:36.059
Have I? I could swear...
I invited him tomorrow.

06:36.240 --> 06:38.265
My Lord, I can only apologise...

06:40.760 --> 06:45.185
My Lord, would you believe,
I've foolishly misarranged my engagements.

06:45.360 --> 06:47.339
Can you forgive me?

06:58.320 --> 06:59.821
(Chatter)

07:00.000 --> 07:01.979
So, Ross...

07:03.520 --> 07:08.389
I understand your brother-in-law has challenged
my gamekeeper to a wrestling match.

07:09.840 --> 07:11.865
Incautious of him, to say the least.

07:12.040 --> 07:15.669
- Tom Harry is a champion and in his prime.
- His stomach would suggest otherwise.

07:15.840 --> 07:18.400
You think, then,
your Methody preacher will prevail?

07:18.560 --> 07:22.508
I hope so.
It's time that hired thug was taught to behave.

07:24.960 --> 07:27.599
I confess, I do find politics that confusing!

07:27.760 --> 07:31.184
Why, for instance,
do Cornwall return over 40 MP5,

07:31.360 --> 07:34.181
but new towns like Manchester
send not a smgle one?

07:34.360 --> 07:38.581
- I agree, it's wholly unjust.
- And wholly appropriate.

07:39.280 --> 07:41.623
Till such times as these upstart boroughs

07:41.800 --> 07:44.303
prove themselves capable
of sound political judgment.

07:44.480 --> 07:48.382
What, like Cornwall? Which persists
in electing members by bribery and favours?

07:48.560 --> 07:51.825
By and large our elected representatives
are men of integrity.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.740
My own nominee, a gentleman, war hero.

07:53.920 --> 07:56.104
By sheer coincidence, your own nephew.

07:56.800 --> 08:00.622
Whereas yours
is a man without scruples or decency.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.904
Perhaps you'd care to lay a wager
on the contest.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.389
- Shall we say a hundred guineas?
- (Chuckles)

08:05.560 --> 08:07.221
On one condition.

08:08.680 --> 08:11.820
Whoever loses...
pays the money to a charitable cause.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.820
- Charitable?
DWIGHT: Excellent thought!

08:14.000 --> 08:16.980
- Might I propose the new hospital in Truro?
- Agreed.

08:20.280 --> 08:23.386
I was saying to Demelza
how tiresome it must be

08:23.560 --> 08:26.222
to be forever battling for the same territory.

08:26.400 --> 08:29.779
Were it left to we ladies,
I wager we'd soon come to agreement.

08:29.960 --> 08:31.541
Well, pray instruct us...

08:31.720 --> 08:35.622
Well, suppose we were
disputing two boroughs...

08:35.800 --> 08:38.064
Say for instance - Truro and Tregony?

08:38.240 --> 08:42.620
- Then I might suggest she yield me Tregony.
- While she concede me Truro.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.377
_ Of course...
she might not wrsh to concede Truro,

08:47.560 --> 08:49.380
were she convinced of the merit
of her candidate.

08:49.560 --> 08:52.063
But suppose that candidate
had failed to impress.

08:52.240 --> 08:55.186
- Had neglected his duty.
- Say, in preserving the peace?

08:55.360 --> 08:58.102
Thereby allowing a man to hang.

08:58.280 --> 09:02.865
A dismal performance.
Quite unworthy of anyone's patronage.

09:05.400 --> 09:06.901
I cannot disagree, my Lord.

09:11.480 --> 09:13.459
More brandy, gentlemen?

09:15.840 --> 09:18.661
- To muscular might.
- You applaud brute force?

09:18.840 --> 09:21.502
Sometimes, in this world, that's what's required.

09:21.680 --> 09:24.660
Even if innocents get trampled
underfoot in the process.

09:26.520 --> 09:28.420
Zacky Martin's son was not innocent.

09:31.160 --> 09:34.618
You consider brutality to be
an essential part of a politician's armoury?

09:34.800 --> 09:39.669
I consider a sentimental weakness
for the poor to be pure self-Indulgence.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.307
Those of us actually in government-

09:41.480 --> 09:44.142
as opposed to those
pontificating from the sidelines -

09:44.320 --> 09:47.904
have a more realistic view
of what's required to run this country.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.018
I look forward to our contest tomorrow.

09:57.560 --> 10:00.586
- I suppose the election result's in no doubt?
- (Door closes)

10:00.760 --> 10:03.069
Well, we'll see less of George
once he's in London.

10:03.240 --> 10:04.787
(Bottles clinking)

10:09.640 --> 10:11.619
(Crashing of waves)

10:19.160 --> 10:21.139
(Gulls crying)

10:33.440 --> 10:35.419
(Grunting and groaning)

10:36.920 --> 10:38.979
Watch your pin, Sam. Again.

10:41.200 --> 10:42.269
Hit!

10:43.920 --> 10:45.706
Hit!

10:45.880 --> 10:46.949
Stay rooted.

10:47.120 --> 10:49.099
(Straining)

10:49.760 --> 10:51.102
Waargh!

10:52.920 --> 10:54.899
(Grunting)

10:59.560 --> 11:02.939
ROSS: It's not the guineas
which concern me, it's Sam.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.747
Why don't you fight Tom Harry?

11:04.920 --> 11:08.799
At least I could nurse your broken bones
in a better cause.

11:09.480 --> 11:11.983
Do you think I could pick and choose
my own battles?

11:12.160 --> 11:14.344
I'd like to think so.

11:15.760 --> 11:17.660
But sometimes they come at me unannounced.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.342
And then?

11:24.680 --> 11:26.739
- (Bubbling)
- Ross!

11:27.680 --> 11:29.659
(Demelza laughs)

12:09.160 --> 12:11.139
ROSS: That's it. Move it this way.

12:12.320 --> 12:14.299
- (Cheering)
- There we go.

12:15.320 --> 12:17.299
MAN: Hooray for the blessed Saint Sawle.

12:18.240 --> 12:19.901
(Children laughing)

12:24.000 --> 12:25.979
(Low chatter)

12:26.600 --> 12:29.160
- Please may I be excused?
- No, you may not.

12:29.320 --> 12:32.505
Feast of Saint Sawle is the one day
that everyone goes to church.

12:32.680 --> 12:34.307
- Jeremy doesn't have to.
- (Chuckles)

12:34.480 --> 12:36.459
(Laughter)

12:37.160 --> 12:40.186
Was Geoffrey-Charles permitted to play
with local urchins?

12:40.360 --> 12:43.659
- Francis saw no harm in it,
- And yet see what came of it-

12:43.840 --> 12:47.389
an inability to discern the proper companions
for a boy of his station.

12:49.280 --> 12:52.909
_We will ensure that our children
Will make more swtable connections.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.183
(Bell tolling)

12:54.360 --> 12:56.339
(Children laughing)

12:57.200 --> 13:00.260
(Cane tapping on floor)

13:00.440 --> 13:02.340
(Chatter dies down)

13:26.560 --> 13:28.824
DR CHOAKE: One cannot expect
immediate relief

13:29.000 --> 13:31.423
when one is dealing with a brain fever.

13:32.320 --> 13:33.787
Is that what we're dealing with?

13:33.960 --> 13:36.781
I believe Dr Enys
first identified the symptoms.

13:36.960 --> 13:39.417
I, however, differ as to treatment.

13:39.600 --> 13:44.947
If my thirsty little colleagues here
produce no good effect,

13:45.120 --> 13:48.704
I propose to shave the head
in order to facilitate...

13:51.000 --> 13:52.979
...trepanation.

13:54.160 --> 13:58.221
Well, daughter, are 'ee ready
to forfeit thy soul t'preacher?

13:58.400 --> 14:02.029
Reckon preacher's soul's on his back for thee!

14:02.200 --> 14:04.623
- Least preacher 'ave a soul!
- (Cackles)

14:08.320 --> 14:10.299
(Children playing and laughing)

14:13.200 --> 14:15.065
(Laughter and low chatter)

14:17.280 --> 14:18.907
Ah, my dear.

14:20.240 --> 14:25.177
I feel it my duty as vicar
to attend the Feast Day festivities.

14:25.960 --> 14:28.940
- Naturally you will not wish to attend...
- Cousin Elizabeth?

14:29.120 --> 14:31.099
Shall we go together?

14:38.760 --> 14:40.307
THOLLY: Here they come.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.186
(Chatter)

14:52.680 --> 14:56.309
I hope you've brought your needle and thread.
Brother Sam may need patching up.

14:57.680 --> 14:58.942
(Chatter)

15:14.560 --> 15:18.189
Welcome, everyone!
A wrestlin' contest!

15:18.360 --> 15:19.622
(Some cheers)

15:20.280 --> 15:22.384
Best of three falls.

15:22.560 --> 15:25.620
On my left, we have Tom Harry.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.745
(Boeing)

15:27.920 --> 15:29.820
And on my right...

15:30.000 --> 15:31.501
5am Came.

15:31.680 --> 15:33.659
(Cheering)

15:34.800 --> 15:36.427
MAN: Go on, Sam!

15:36.600 --> 15:38.739
Right. Shake hands in the middle.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.818
- (Thud)
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, none of that.

15:43.600 --> 15:45.261
On the whistle.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.305
Use your size, Tom.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.141
(Shouts of encouragement)

15:49.320 --> 15:50.947
(Whistle)

15:52.840 --> 15:54.899
See this delivered, without delay.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.299
(Shouts of encouragement)

16:03.640 --> 16:05.619
(Groaning)

16:08.480 --> 16:10.823
- Come on, boy!
- Roll him over.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.979
Come on, Sam.

16:15.720 --> 16:18.063
- (Crackin
- Aargh!g)

16:20.240 --> 16:21.821
Keep your eyes on him!

16:22.000 --> 16:23.979
- Come on, Sam!
- Steady on!

16:24.440 --> 16:25.623
That's it!

16:25.800 --> 16:26.869
Go on, Sam.

16:27.040 --> 16:28.940
' (Sam grunts)
- (Cheering)

16:31.640 --> 16:34.143
- Get on, boy!
- Proper stuff.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.427
First fall to Sam Came!

16:37.600 --> 16:39.340
Come on!

16:39.920 --> 16:42.377
Yes! Come on, Sam.

16:42.560 --> 16:44.699
- Come on, Uncle Sam!
- Yay!

16:44.880 --> 16:46.507
Yaw. ./

16:46.680 --> 16:48.500
Thank you.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.139
From Lord Falmouth.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.579
I'll return as soon as I can.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.299
Ready? Second fall.
On the whistle.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.505
- Come on, Sam.
- (Shouts of encouragement)

17:04.680 --> 17:06.659
Get on!

17:07.720 --> 17:08.982
Get up, Harry.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.502
Get up. Come on.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.659
Come on.

17:18.400 --> 17:20.709
(Shouts of encouragement)

17:20.880 --> 17:22.142
Tholly! He's cheating.

17:22.320 --> 17:24.982
- Tholly!
- His eyes! Mind his eyes!

17:25.520 --> 17:27.977
- Take him apart.
- Hey!

17:28.480 --> 17:30.380
(Gasps)
3am!

17:30.560 --> 17:32.221
Come on. He's cheating again.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.504
- Get off him.
- Stop it. Off him.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.420
Off him! That's enough.

17:36.600 --> 17:38.579
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, heY!

17:39.160 --> 17:42.186
Second fall to Tom Harry.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.100
Cheating, finaglin' worm!

17:47.480 --> 17:49.823
Have a drink.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.423
(Bottles clinking)

17:54.480 --> 17:57.620
- His Lordship has no patience.
DWIGHT: Sir?

17:57.800 --> 18:01.543
I've assured him that these treatments
must be allowed to take their course,

18:01.720 --> 18:06.498
but he's used to dictating terms,
so he must take the consequences.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.339
Ha! Good luck to you, sir.

18:13.280 --> 18:16.420
- Trepanation?
- You can see why my uncle sent for you.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.420
Shall we try less primitive methods?

18:18.600 --> 18:22.707
I have a powder to lower the fever,
and another to reduce headaches.

18:22.880 --> 18:26.259
But...you yourself must play a part.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.897
Trust in your own powers of recovery.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.339
Suppose my faith is wavering?

18:33.040 --> 18:36.544
THOLLY: Final fall! All to play for.
- (Whistle)

18:36.720 --> 18:39.280
(Shouts of encouragement)

18:42.360 --> 18:44.703
-(Shouﬁng)
- Go on, Sam!

18:48.720 --> 18:50.699
- You watch it!
- Tholly!

18:51.800 --> 18:53.984
You all right? Careful!

18:54.160 --> 18:56.469
- (Shouts of encouragement)
- Tom Harry!

19:00.760 --> 19:01.897
-(Panﬂng)
- Hurt him, Tom!

19:02.080 --> 19:03.342
Come on, Tom!

19:04.240 --> 19:08.222
You're welcome to her soul, brother.
I've already had her body!

19:08.400 --> 19:10.220
(Chuckles)

19:12.640 --> 19:14.779
(TOrn H
_ fig grunts)

19:14.960 --> 19:16.939
(Gasps of shock)

19:17.640 --> 19:20.461
And the winner is...Tom Harry!

19:20.640 --> 19:22.619
(Some booing)

19:28.280 --> 19:30.259
(Groans)

19:39.360 --> 19:41.578
(Jaunty violin music)

19:41.760 --> 19:44.263
- (Shouts of encouragement)
WOMAN: Wooh!

19:46.400 --> 19:49.187
(Chatter)

20:00.800 --> 20:02.620
(Low chatter)

20:04.280 --> 20:06.259
(Laughter)

20:10.000 --> 20:11.979
Valentine, come here.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.539
JEREMY: Bye, Valentine.

20:19.160 --> 20:21.139
(Waves crashing)

20:27.120 --> 20:28.303
(Exhales)

20:35.600 --> 20:37.579
Morwenna?

20:44.120 --> 20:46.782
I saw 'ee - at the hanging.

20:48.840 --> 20:50.546
I thought...

20:51.920 --> 20:54.627
I thought it was the last time
I should ever see you.

20:56.840 --> 20:59.661
Knowing 'ee were there,
I'd have died content.

21:05.560 --> 21:07.266
I cannot be seen here.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.779
With you.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.943
How are 'ee, Morwenna?

21:16.120 --> 21:18.099
Do he treat 'ee more kindly now?

21:18.280 --> 21:19.542
Wife!

21:23.520 --> 21:25.579
- I was collecting shells.
- Alone?

21:25.760 --> 21:30.185
Well, have a care.
Here we're at the very edge of civilisation.

21:30.960 --> 21:33.417
I believe the natives can be quite barbaric.

21:46.040 --> 21:48.019
(Jaunty music)

21:52.280 --> 21:54.589
(Drunkenly) Greet thy champion!

21:55.480 --> 21:57.823
And sing 'is praises.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.024
(Belches)

21:59.200 --> 22:03.899
For he is very...glad to be at thy service.

22:11.800 --> 22:13.859
We thank you for that service.

22:14.040 --> 22:17.919
And from now on..._
we no longer reqUIre it.

22:25.360 --> 22:27.624
Brute force wins the day!

22:27.800 --> 22:30.303
And I'm delighted the hospital will benefit.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.306
(Tholly laughs)

22:37.480 --> 22:39.459
Cap'n.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.739
It's from Dwight.

22:57.360 --> 22:59.339
(Door opens)

23:09.200 --> 23:11.384
HUGH: Ross?

23:11.560 --> 23:13.539
A pretty jest, is it not?

23:13.720 --> 23:16.780
To cheat the French,
and then oneself be cheated?

23:16.960 --> 23:20.544
I hope you'll soon gain the upper hand.

23:21.160 --> 23:23.139
- Will I?
- We'll do our best!

23:26.400 --> 23:28.265
Demelza.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.224
Would you sit with me awhile?

23:44.600 --> 23:47.899
Too many visitors will tire him.
I'll wait downstairs.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.901
- Courage, my friend.
- Thank you.

24:02.760 --> 24:06.218
- How serious is it?
- Difficult to say.

24:06.400 --> 24:09.506
There seems to be
some underlying weakness.

24:09.680 --> 24:14.299
Some lowering of resistance which
makes him susceptible to every passing ill.

24:14.480 --> 24:17.620
Of course, his time in France
will render him more vulnerable.

24:17.800 --> 24:20.223
But I sense there's more to it than that.

24:20.400 --> 24:23.346
He seems...somehow resigned.

24:23.960 --> 24:26.599
Why? When he has everything to live for.

24:27.320 --> 24:31.541
A glittering career, a noble family name,
a new life in London.

24:31.720 --> 24:36.020
Perhaps those things hold less
attraction for him than...other things

24:36.200 --> 24:38.623
which are more difficult to attain.

24:39.560 --> 24:41.744
One would hope they're more difficult.

24:41.920 --> 24:43.899
(Throat cleared)

24:44.800 --> 24:48.429
Captain Poldark, would you favour me
with a few moments of your company?

24:53.520 --> 24:56.159
My nephew will be very glad to see your wife.

24:56.320 --> 24:59.107
He thinks highly of her. As do I.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.779
And I.

25:02.200 --> 25:06.227
Of course, you're aware that,
thanks to her efforts,

25:06.400 --> 25:08.664
Francis Basset and I have come to an accord?

25:10.080 --> 25:13.220
- I was not aware. _
- However, I would not be so naive

25:13.400 --> 25:15.982
as to suppose the strength of feeling
which arose against me

25:16.160 --> 25:18.344
at the last election no longer exists.

25:19.280 --> 25:21.305
Even without Basset's support,

25:21.480 --> 25:25.064
many who voted for Warleggan
will not change their allegiance.

25:25.960 --> 25:29.339
Of course, whatever happens to Hugh...

25:31.240 --> 25:34.107
...he will not be fit to fight this election.

25:35.640 --> 25:38.746
No. No, of course not.

25:39.640 --> 25:41.346
A great pity.

25:41.520 --> 25:44.785
And by now you'll have had to choose
some other candidate.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.939
I have, indeed.

25:48.920 --> 25:54.984
I warn you.
His Lordship is not fond of unexpected guests.

25:55.160 --> 25:58.505
We are not guests. I am his elected
representative in Parliament.

25:58.680 --> 25:59.783
Hm.

25:59.960 --> 26:03.737
Since the riots he's been much engaged
with affairs of state.

26:03.920 --> 26:07.219
And whatever coolness
you may have imagined towards us...

26:07.400 --> 26:11.746
Should it continue, it would create
an unfortunate impression.

26:11.920 --> 26:14.104
Then we will create a different one.

26:14.680 --> 26:18.741
Arrange a series of public appearances
where Basset and I can demonstrate

26:18.920 --> 26:22.549
that we are, in all things, as one.

26:24.680 --> 26:28.707
Tell him I am otherwise engaged.
And will be for the rest of the day.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.099
(Door opens and slams shut)

26:42.800 --> 26:46.679
But why, when you have the pick
of the county to choose from, choose me?

26:46.840 --> 26:49.582
Because I believe you have
the best chance of winning the seat.

26:49.760 --> 26:54.106
Confess. Do you not feel some frustration
with your present life?

26:55.160 --> 26:57.947
Your inability to influence matters
you care deeply about?

27:01.480 --> 27:02.742
(Door opens)

27:06.800 --> 27:08.540
I think I've stayed late enough.

27:25.920 --> 27:30.266
The last time we spoke,
we were at odds on just about everything.

27:30.440 --> 27:34.786
The function of Parliament, the way men are
elected, the unequal distribution of power.

27:34.960 --> 27:40.387
Times change. Perhaps my views
are less far from yours than once they were.

27:41.080 --> 27:45.028
Work for reform...from within the House.

27:45.200 --> 27:49.227
Not all politicians find it necessary
to sell their souls.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.784
DEMELZA: What would it mean?

27:57.920 --> 28:00.104
Parting from you.

28:04.360 --> 28:06.783
Becoming strangers for much of the year.

28:06.960 --> 28:08.939
I in London, you in Cornwall.

28:13.800 --> 28:15.461
Could you bear it?

28:17.720 --> 28:19.187
Could you?

28:20.240 --> 28:22.219
GEORGE: From one of my agents.

28:23.760 --> 28:26.547
"Basset and Falmouth
have reached an accord"?

28:26.720 --> 28:30.542
Falmouth will not contest Tregony.
Basset will not contest Truro.

28:30.720 --> 28:33.382
In other words, he's thrown us over.

28:33.560 --> 28:35.824
- How dare he?
- But it...it matters not.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.946
My uncle has begun canvassing
the burgesses and he assures me...

28:39.120 --> 28:43.864
That the majority wouldn't vote for a Falmouth
candidate if the end of the world was nigh!

28:44.040 --> 28:46.019
(Approaching footsteps)

28:51.880 --> 28:52.904
Well?

28:53.080 --> 28:55.219
ELIZABETH: Can you be certain?
- Not entirely.

28:55.400 --> 29:00.599
Which is why we've taken steps to increase
the obligations of certain electors.

29:00.760 --> 29:03.820
- Threatened them.
- Encouraged them...

29:04.600 --> 29:07.546
...to see the advantages
of continued allegiance.

29:07.720 --> 29:10.826
And the disadvantages of the reverse.

29:11.000 --> 29:15.869
All of which may in fact result in a larger majority
than the one I secured last time.

29:16.040 --> 29:17.382
ROSS: These are my terms.

29:17.560 --> 29:20.859
I may support Pitt
in any measure to sustain the war.

29:22.200 --> 29:24.464
I may support the abolition of slavery.

29:24.640 --> 29:27.985
I may take any action I feel will benefit the poor.

29:31.840 --> 29:32.943
Agreed.

29:34.080 --> 29:36.457
I accept the nomination.

29:37.680 --> 29:40.581
_ So all is well? _
We Will return to Westminster?

29:40.760 --> 29:43.740
My dear, order your gowns
to be packed without delay.

30:32.720 --> 30:35.621
HUGH: When I am gone,
remember this of me

30:35.800 --> 30:39.179
That earth of earth
or heaven of heaven concealed

30:39.360 --> 30:42.261
/Vo greater happ/hess
than was to me revealed

30:42.440 --> 30:44.499
By favour of a smgle day with thee...

30:44.680 --> 30:46.659
(Door opens)

30:52.640 --> 30:54.619
CLOWANCE: Mama. Mama!

31:01.160 --> 31:03.139
DEMELZA: What is it, sweetheart?

31:04.800 --> 31:08.304
Jeremy, what have I told you
about teasing your sister?

31:18.080 --> 31:20.059
(Door closes)

31:27.080 --> 31:28.468
Demelza. ..

31:29.800 --> 31:31.779
I must ask you...

31:34.960 --> 31:36.746
Are you afraid?

31:38.240 --> 31:39.707
Of what we agreed today?

31:41.200 --> 31:44.180
(Exhales heavily) More than afraid.

31:45.920 --> 31:47.467
Yet I know it must be so.

31:49.400 --> 31:51.186
Do not fear it.

31:52.240 --> 31:53.707
George will win.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.819
And I will stay.

31:58.840 --> 32:00.387
And Hugh will live.

32:14.920 --> 32:18.026
Brother Sam?
Have 'ee said aught about the wrestlin'?

32:18.200 --> 32:19.269
DEMELZA: Not a word.

32:19.440 --> 32:22.147
You know I promised to go
to his prayin' feast if he won.

32:23.120 --> 32:26.783
- So why did he let Tom Harry win?
- Maybe he don't want to win you that way.

32:26.960 --> 32:29.542
If he'd won, would you have kept
to your side of the bargain?

32:29.720 --> 32:32.359
- Of course.
- And could 'ee not still?

32:36.400 --> 32:37.662
- I'm afeared.
- Of what?

32:37.840 --> 32:39.899
That I'd feel naught.

32:40.080 --> 32:44.267
That I'd want to be saved, but...
I'd be led to pretendin' I'm saved.

32:47.160 --> 32:48.787
Do you love him?

32:52.080 --> 32:55.425
Be advised.
What he believes is who he is.

32:56.680 --> 32:58.898
Ye can't love Sam without lovin' his faith.

32:59.760 --> 33:01.739
Come on.

33:02.880 --> 33:05.587
DEMELZA: You must choose.
Take all of him.

33:07.120 --> 33:08.826
Or none.

33:15.960 --> 33:17.825
(Birdsong)

33:18.000 --> 33:20.867
This afternoon's election...
Will you go, cousm?

33:21.040 --> 33:22.860
Oh, now, there Will be a tussle!

33:23.040 --> 33:24.257
(Clears throat)

33:24.440 --> 33:27.546
Will your opponent attract many votes,
do you think?

33:27.720 --> 33:30.223
On account of his exploits in France?

33:30.680 --> 33:31.704
Doubtful.

33:31.880 --> 33:34.940
Armitage is new to the business
and would do better to return to the Naw.

33:35.120 --> 33:37.224
Oh! You have not heard?

33:37.400 --> 33:39.459
Armitage is sick.

33:39.640 --> 33:42.746
Falmouth was obliged
to choose another candidate.

33:42.920 --> 33:45.559
- Oh?
- And Who might...

33:45.720 --> 33:48.359
Poldark! Poldark of Nampara!

33:48.520 --> 33:50.829
Myself, I should have thought him
too much of a rogue.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.582
But no doubt he thinks
to turn his notoriety to some account.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.978
Are you sure you have the right person, Ossie?

33:56.160 --> 33:58.537
Gad, yes! I had it from my tailor!

33:58.720 --> 34:00.540
Who had it from Sir Hugh Bodrugan!

34:00.720 --> 34:03.097
Who said, "Poldark in Parliament

34:03.280 --> 34:05.657
shall provide more backbone than wishbone!"

34:05.840 --> 34:08.400
(Guffaws)

34:10.640 --> 34:12.824
He's not yet there.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.786
Oh.

34:16.040 --> 34:17.940
(Birdsong)

34:18.120 --> 34:20.099
(Light snoring)

34:38.760 --> 34:43.265
I'm sorry, Uncle...
that I cannot oblige you today.

34:43.440 --> 34:45.658
(Scoffs) Hey.

34:45.840 --> 34:47.899
There'll be other occasions, my boy.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.501
(Wheezes)

34:51.680 --> 34:53.659
(Horse Whinnies)

35:01.800 --> 35:03.779
(Letter rustling)

35:05.000 --> 35:06.979
From Tregothnan.

35:13.480 --> 35:15.459
Asking for you.

35:31.400 --> 35:36.019
Seddon, Gough, Tippet, Howell,
Killick, Pooley: these votes are assured.

35:36.200 --> 35:40.421
Less certain is Aukitt,
but he's received a substantial loan

35:40.600 --> 35:44.661
Which he knows is due for repayment
if he votes unwisely.

35:45.360 --> 35:49.057
These three - they're marginal.
They could swing the vote either way.

35:49.240 --> 35:52.903
Prynne, Hick, Musgrave.
Older gentry, well connected, set in their ways.

35:53.080 --> 35:55.059
And old friends of the Chynoweths.

35:59.680 --> 36:01.659
I told you my wife would be useful.

36:06.240 --> 36:08.617
ROSS: You've abandoned your post?

36:09.320 --> 36:11.220
This time it was the patient Who dismissed me.

36:11.400 --> 36:12.867
In favour of his other visitor?

36:13.040 --> 36:15.065
I made him comfortable.

36:15.240 --> 36:17.219
What else could I do?

36:19.480 --> 36:22.665
ROSS: Is it true that swans mate for life?
- I believe so.

36:24.640 --> 36:27.302
Or at least until
a more handsome swan appears.

36:31.240 --> 36:33.219
No-one seems able to cure me.

36:36.320 --> 36:37.537
And yet...

36:39.240 --> 36:41.800
I think there's someone...who could.

36:42.640 --> 36:44.619
Well, let them be sent for!

36:46.480 --> 36:48.220
She's here.

36:49.240 --> 36:51.105
L?

36:51.280 --> 36:54.420
I have no miraculous powers.
What could I do?

36:56.960 --> 36:58.939
Give me hope?

37:05.600 --> 37:07.579
In spite of how I care for you...

37:08.600 --> 37:11.160
...and all that's between us...

37:13.720 --> 37:16.382
...it is not in my power
to give you what you seek.

37:20.880 --> 37:23.667
Well, then, I must be content with what I had.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.979
For it was no small treasure.

37:28.960 --> 37:32.657
To have once possessed you, body and soul.

37:39.120 --> 37:42.942
I never asked you...
What led you to accept the nomination?

37:45.080 --> 37:47.059
A moment of madness.

37:47.760 --> 37:49.500
Which I now regret.

37:55.400 --> 37:57.379
(Low chatter)

38:07.280 --> 38:09.840
Once again he puts me in a quandary.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.377
You dislike Falmouth,
so how can you vote for his man?

38:12.560 --> 38:14.539
Quite so.

38:23.600 --> 38:26.160
You're a veteran of these affairs, Harris.
What's the form?

38:26.320 --> 38:31.019
Do I shake hands With my opponent or...
am I permitted to glare at him across the hall?

38:31.200 --> 38:33.839
- The latter, I believe, is customary.
- And safer.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.979
(Chuckling)

38:39.440 --> 38:40.464
(Rings)

38:40.640 --> 38:42.904
Ladies, gentlemen, quiet, please.

38:44.400 --> 38:49.099
It is three o' clock. Let the Proclamation
and Notice of the Election now be read.

38:51.400 --> 38:55.063
Gentlemen, I propose Mr George Warleggan.

38:55.600 --> 39:00.981
An experienced candidate who has served
this borough faithfully for many years.

39:01.160 --> 39:05.585
A banker and merchant with
a thorough knowledge of local affairs.

39:06.360 --> 39:10.626
A magistrate, a keen upholder of the laW,

39:10.800 --> 39:13.587
Which puts him in stark contrast
to his opponent

39:13.760 --> 39:16.263
Who has frequently shown himself
to be above the law.

39:17.760 --> 39:20.627
I commend to you a man
Who stands against lawlessness,

39:20.800 --> 39:22.506
against corruption,

39:22.680 --> 39:26.264
Who will fight for the interests
of this borough in Parliament.

39:27.320 --> 39:29.697
- (Smattering of applause)
- What a paragon!

39:29.880 --> 39:33.259
I'm almost ready to vote for him myself.

39:33.440 --> 39:37.467
Gentlemen, may I propose as my candidate...

39:38.240 --> 39:40.219
...Captain Ross Poldark.

39:40.680 --> 39:45.879
New to governance but known to all
as a brave and distinguished soldier.

39:56.680 --> 39:57.942
Thank you.

39:59.200 --> 40:00.667
(Murmuring)

40:02.280 --> 40:05.181
- Short and sweet.
- A welcome change.

40:13.440 --> 40:16.022
CLERK: Let the voting now commence.

40:17.480 --> 40:19.857
I cast my vote
for Mr George Warleggan.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.899
Captain Ross Poldark.

40:35.560 --> 40:36.777
(Low chatter)

40:38.040 --> 40:40.019
Captain Poldark.

40:47.400 --> 40:49.106
Mr George Warleggan.

40:52.760 --> 40:54.466
Mr George Warleggan.

40:54.760 --> 40:56.739
Mr George Warleggan.

40:57.400 --> 40:59.379
Mr George Warleggan.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.979
Mr George Warleggan.

41:02.400 --> 41:04.743
ROSS: Three more votes and George has it.

41:06.320 --> 41:08.379
Captain Ross Poldark.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.309
Mr George Warleggan.

41:29.080 --> 41:30.468
Mr George Warleggan.

41:32.880 --> 41:34.222
Six votes remaining.

41:34.400 --> 41:36.504
ROSS: And George only needs one more.

41:49.480 --> 41:51.744
_ Basset will look a fool
if he goes against the tide now.

41:51.920 --> 41:54.787
- Here it comes.
- It's a rout.

41:56.240 --> 41:57.423
Captain Ross Poldark.

41:57.600 --> 41:59.579
(Murmuring)

42:06.600 --> 42:08.147
(Whispers)

42:15.880 --> 42:17.859
Captain Ross Poldark.

42:19.400 --> 42:21.823
- Captain Poldark.
- (Murmuring)

42:24.600 --> 42:26.067
Hick and Musgrave.

42:26.240 --> 42:29.346
And my wife just charmed
the breeches off them.

42:30.280 --> 42:31.827
Captain Poldark.

42:37.280 --> 42:41.182
- Captain Poldark.
- Did you not tell me I had their votes?

42:53.360 --> 42:55.339
- Captain Ross Poldark.
- (Shocked murmuring)

42:55.520 --> 42:58.660
DWIGHT: Ross, it's yours.
- Mr George Warleggan has eight votes.

42:58.840 --> 43:01.263
Captain Ross Poldark has nine votes.

43:01.440 --> 43:04.466
I therefore declare
Captain Poldark to be the Winner.

43:04.640 --> 43:07.382
MEN: Yes! Yes!
- (Cheering and laughter)

43:10.920 --> 43:13.104
Thank you very much for your vote.

43:33.840 --> 43:35.819
(Applause continues)

43:39.080 --> 43:42.538
How did he manage it?
How could he possibly defeat you?

43:42.720 --> 43:45.097
He... He did not defeat me!

43:45.280 --> 43:46.622
Prejudice defeated me.

43:46.800 --> 43:51.305
Privilege has closed ranks and chosen
to forget the misdemeanours of his past!

43:51.480 --> 43:53.903
And I, who have
worked tirelessly within the laW,

43:54.080 --> 43:55.980
given money to all sorts of worthy causes,

43:56.160 --> 44:00.938
am regarded with contempt
because my ancestry is inferior to his!

44:05.160 --> 44:07.344
I did what I could.

44:13.640 --> 44:16.985
- Will Mistress Poldark be joining us?
- She went to visit a sick friend.

44:17.160 --> 44:18.787
I told her it was the worthier cause,

44:18.960 --> 44:21.940
since I hadn't the least expectation
of prevailing here!

44:22.120 --> 44:24.543
Congratulations, Captain.
We have won the day.

44:24.720 --> 44:26.699
By a very narrow margin.

44:26.880 --> 44:29.440
No margin is too narrow
so long as it's the right way.

44:29.600 --> 44:32.103
Will you join us for the dinner at the Red Lion?

44:33.600 --> 44:36.387
Forgive me, but I'm not in the mood to celebrate.

44:36.560 --> 44:37.948
L-I just received word.

44:40.480 --> 44:43.426
My nephew died...a few hours ago.

44:46.720 --> 44:49.063
I hope he took comfort from your Wife's visit.

44:51.080 --> 44:52.945
I'm so sorry.

44:53.120 --> 44:55.099
Please...excuse me.

45:05.920 --> 45:07.182
(Gulls cry)

45:07.360 --> 45:10.022
- Did you know he would die?
- I suspected it.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.458
But What purpose would it be
to tell you before the election?

45:15.000 --> 45:18.697
- I was certain he'd survive.
- He was still so young.

45:23.600 --> 45:26.057
And, to be frank...

45:27.120 --> 45:29.680
I often wondered if...

45:31.400 --> 45:33.982
If he exaggerated his pain
in order to gain sympathy?

45:34.160 --> 45:37.266
(Exhales heavily)
I'm ashamed of the thought.

45:38.000 --> 45:39.945
Then console yourself with this:

45:40.120 --> 45:43.942
henceforth, he'll be immortal
in everyone's memory.

45:44.760 --> 45:47.547
And we poor souls
Will look pale in comparison.

45:48.800 --> 45:50.984
Yes.

45:51.160 --> 45:53.139
The thought had occurred to me.

46:10.880 --> 46:12.586
I wanted to tell 'ee.

46:16.520 --> 46:18.659
A man's never had me.

46:20.640 --> 46:24.667
Even if they had, 't'Would make no odds.

46:26.560 --> 46:28.460
The soul can still be saved.

46:28.640 --> 46:33.509
And there be more joy in heaven
over one sinner that repent.

46:33.680 --> 46:37.980
But that's just it, Sam. I don't repent.

46:40.280 --> 46:42.737
I could pretend to, but ye'd know.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.104
What good would that do us?

46:49.360 --> 46:51.339
So...

46:52.240 --> 46:53.662
...l’m gem’away.

46:56.040 --> 46:58.986
- To marry Tom?
- A cock's life, no!

47:00.000 --> 47:01.627
To Tehidy.

47:01.800 --> 47:03.825
My Lady Dunstanville
have want of a maid.

47:05.760 --> 47:08.399
Just for a year.

47:08.560 --> 47:12.223
And after that...if 'ee still Wish it...

47:12.400 --> 47:14.709
and if...ifI still Wish it...

47:17.960 --> 47:19.939
...We'll meet again.

47:20.920 --> 47:23.024
See how things come out. See...

47:24.920 --> 47:26.979
See if there be any change.

47:28.280 --> 47:30.259
There'll be none from me.

47:47.200 --> 47:49.225
You're a rare good man, Sam.

47:59.360 --> 48:00.861
Believe me,

48:01.040 --> 48:02.985
it gives me no satisfaction...

48:04.120 --> 48:06.020
...to be...mm...

48:06.200 --> 48:08.942
forced to...stoop to the services

48:09.120 --> 48:12.146
of a - mm! - common drab.

48:13.160 --> 48:15.299
And all because...

48:15.480 --> 48:19.143
my Wife refuses to perform
her conjugal duties.

48:21.360 --> 48:23.817
- (He moans)
- She don't know What she missin'.

48:32.560 --> 48:34.539
Leave us.

48:39.840 --> 48:42.479
This is a set-back.
Nothing more.

48:42.640 --> 48:44.824
We will not let it compromise our plans.

48:50.440 --> 48:52.419
Any of our plans.

49:01.080 --> 49:03.059
ROWELLA: Oh, Vicar!

49:05.240 --> 49:07.947
- Good day t'you.
- Sister-in-law!

49:08.480 --> 49:11.222
- How is your...
- Health?

49:11.400 --> 49:13.960
Oh, Vicar, I'm so very grieved!

49:14.120 --> 49:17.339
- I'm afraid I was mistook.
- In What regard?

49:18.200 --> 49:21.943
It does appear now
that I was not after all With child.

49:23.720 --> 49:26.826
Are...you...serious?

49:27.000 --> 49:30.219
I can only plead youth
and extreme ignorance of these matters.

49:30.720 --> 49:33.097
You are the Devil's handmaiden.

49:33.600 --> 49:37.377
Sent to tempt and destroy
one of God's own ministers!

49:38.160 --> 49:41.106
Did you not invent...the entire fable...

49:41.280 --> 49:43.737
to blackmail and cheat me
into providing a dowry for...

49:43.920 --> 49:45.057
Vicar!

49:45.240 --> 49:47.219
I'm ashamed of you!

49:48.320 --> 49:50.379
However could you think such a thing?

50:08.120 --> 50:10.577
PRUDIE:
Roll it and pat it and mark it with "P"

50:10.760 --> 50:13.502
Put it in the oven for Prudie and thee!

50:13.680 --> 50:15.227
(Chuckles)

50:24.040 --> 50:26.019
Maid not with 'ee?

50:27.800 --> 50:29.620
She's not returned?

50:29.800 --> 50:32.746
Not since this morn
When she rid for Tregothnan.

50:35.400 --> 50:37.539
Hugh Armitage is dead.

50:37.720 --> 50:39.699
Oh, Lord!

50:40.960 --> 50:42.541
Oh, God bless 'im.

50:42.720 --> 50:44.699
Oh, comfort the maid.

50:45.720 --> 50:47.221
She'll be that...

50:50.200 --> 50:53.749
Yes. She was fond of him.

50:56.200 --> 50:59.180
- Perhaps I should go in search of her.
- Nay, sir.

51:00.360 --> 51:01.748
Only that...

51:03.600 --> 51:06.103
Maybe she wish to grieve alone awhile?

51:06.520 --> 51:09.102
Maybe leave her
to come back of her own accord?

51:38.080 --> 51:40.059
(Waves crashing)

51:59.960 --> 52:01.939
(Door opens)

52:06.160 --> 52:08.867
Ross. I thought you would be abed.

52:09.040 --> 52:12.259
Because I could sleep...
knowing you were not home?

52:12.440 --> 52:14.419
I went to Caroline.

52:15.920 --> 52:17.785
I had to talk to someone and...

52:18.920 --> 52:21.559
...I know no-one closer, more truly a friend.

52:21.720 --> 52:23.699
Except me.

52:24.400 --> 52:28.177
Was it not so?
Before all this happened?

52:31.080 --> 52:34.106
It was. Always.

52:36.360 --> 52:39.989
But in this? Ross, how could I tell you?

52:40.160 --> 52:42.503
Do you not think I'd want to be told?

52:42.680 --> 52:45.979
And to explain something
I don't rightly understand myself?

52:56.520 --> 52:58.499
Try.

53:12.840 --> 53:15.582
(Tearfully) This...thing...

53:16.600 --> 53:18.465
...came upon me unawares, I...

53:19.160 --> 53:20.741
I never sought it. I...

53:21.680 --> 53:25.025
I never thought there was place
in my heart for any but you.

53:28.200 --> 53:29.906
But somehow...

53:31.600 --> 53:33.704
- ...somehow... _
- You came to love him.

53:34.440 --> 53:36.146
Not love...

53:36.640 --> 53:39.586
Not love such as we - such as you and I.

53:40.240 --> 53:41.946
No love could match that.

53:44.200 --> 53:45.588
But...

53:47.200 --> 53:48.827
Yes, he...

53:49.000 --> 53:50.501
he did touch my heart.

53:56.400 --> 53:58.504
- And now?
- (Sobs)

54:00.240 --> 54:02.822
And now I feel as if my heart is broke.

54:05.560 --> 54:07.585
Not as it was with Julia.

54:08.440 --> 54:10.897
Then my tears were like blood from a stone.

54:11.640 --> 54:13.585
I durst not let 'em fall.

54:14.960 --> 54:16.939
And yet now they fall
like summer rain.

54:18.320 --> 54:20.026
And not only for Hugh.

54:20.920 --> 54:23.480
It's for her and me...

54:23.640 --> 54:27.383
and...and...all that's wasted

54:27.560 --> 54:30.506
and...and broken and lost in this world.

54:32.520 --> 54:34.499
Save some tears for me.

54:36.120 --> 54:38.304
For I believe I'll need them.

54:40.800 --> 54:42.779
This hurt...

54:44.640 --> 54:46.028
It Will mend.

54:54.640 --> 54:56.858
And this sad, sorry, broken world?

54:59.160 --> 55:00.627
Will that mend too?

55:02.720 --> 55:04.779
Who will mend it, Ross?

55:05.920 --> 55:07.387
Will you?

55:09.880 --> 55:11.780
I will try.

55:15.480 --> 55:17.857
The election.
What happened?

55:19.800 --> 55:21.984
The very last thing we thought.

55:22.440 --> 55:25.022
- Huh!
- You won?

55:25.960 --> 55:27.348
Yes.

55:29.800 --> 55:31.700
And now?

55:31.880 --> 55:33.700
Everything Will change.

55:49.600 --> 55:52.421
Be good...while I am away.

55:53.640 --> 55:55.744
And you, look after your mother.

55:55.920 --> 55:57.899
- Aye.
- Good boy.

56:01.240 --> 56:03.822
(Coachman urges horses to stop)

56:06.240 --> 56:08.424
- (Horses Whinny)
COACHMAN: Woah, woah.

56:23.320 --> 56:25.106
Thanks.

56:35.920 --> 56:37.899
(Coachman urges on horses)
