a super bowl of masked singers,

I always felt like I was
playing a character.

02:57.636 --> 03:02.097
<i> Boys are supposed</i>
<i> to play sports, and I tried.</i>

03:02.141 --> 03:06.560

<i> to let their emotions show,</i>
<i> so I tried that too.</i>

03:06.604 --> 03:08.228
Aw, poor guy.

03:08.230 --> 03:11.481
- Wow.
-<i> But secretly I always knew</i>

03:11.525 --> 03:15.027
<i> I was someone else,</i>

03:15.070 --> 03:16.361
<i> and when there's</i>
<i> no role models like you,</i>

03:16.405 --> 03:19.364
<i> it can make you feel</i>
<i> a little invisible.</i>

03:19.408 --> 03:21.950
<i> It took me a long time</i>
<i> to find the people</i>

03:21.994 --> 03:24.161

Nick, by the way,
didn't niecy nash

06:27.262 --> 06:29.846

These two, I don't know
what these two are on.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.060
- All right, back to business.
- Okay.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.228
We're gonna go
to our clue expert--

06:36.230 --> 06:38.021
who's failing this season.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.231
I didn't say it.
You said it.

06:39.233 --> 06:42.317
Who do you think the bull is?

06:42.361 --> 06:44.361
The first time I ever saw bull

06:44.363 --> 06:46.655
I was thinking this is
a boy bander.

06:46.657 --> 06:48.073
I was thinking brian littrell.

06:48.117 --> 06:51.243
- Brian can sing.
He could dance.
- Ken: Yes, yes.

06:51.286 --> 06:53.328
Don't worry.
I figured that out,

06:53.372 --> 06:56.123
because one of the clues
was he's a solo performer,

06:56.166 --> 06:57.249
and we did see the drama mask,

06:57.292 --> 07:00.043
and we know
he's very theatrical.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.462
So I'm thinking someone like
a tituss burgess.

07:02.464 --> 07:05.215
- Ken: There you go.
- Or a neil patrick harris.

07:05.217 --> 07:07.676
Ken: I like that,
because throughout the season,

07:07.719 --> 07:11.179
it was peppered with scrubs
and, like, medical, you know--

07:11.223 --> 07:14.182
so it could be someone
like neil patrick harris.

07:14.226 --> 07:15.767
But then I was also
thinking taye diggs

07:15.811 --> 07:18.395
who was also in
"private practice,"
who'd been on broadway.

07:18.439 --> 07:21.106
- Taye diggs is a good guess.
- Yeah, it's a good guess?

07:21.150 --> 07:24.317
Sherlock scherzie
is in the building,
aka nic tracy.

07:24.361 --> 07:26.653
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
- And she said...

07:26.697 --> 07:28.155
- She figured it out...
- She's got the look.

07:28.198 --> 07:30.365
- ...From day one.
- Ken: Uh-oh.

07:30.409 --> 07:33.618
Yeah, as soon
as I saw him perform, nick,

07:33.662 --> 07:35.954
I felt it in my nails, my hair,

07:35.998 --> 07:39.583
my hips, and my heels, okay?
I did.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.751
- Ken: Wow.
- But I was like,
you know what?

07:41.795 --> 07:44.421
I'm coming for
that golden ear trophy.
I'm keeping it.

07:44.465 --> 07:46.089
I'm holding it
close to my chest,

07:46.133 --> 07:48.884
and, yeah,
I think I know who this is.

07:48.927 --> 07:50.969
Well, thanks for nothing,
nicole. Thank you.

07:51.054 --> 07:53.096
- Nicole: You're welcome, ken!
- Well, it's definitely not
thanks for nothing.

07:53.098 --> 07:55.599
Thanks for one of
the most amazing performances

07:55.601 --> 07:57.100
we've seen on this stage!

07:57.144 --> 08:00.937
- The bull! Great job!
- Ken: Yes!

08:00.981 --> 08:02.355
Nick:<i> The panel</i>

- Yes.
- But sherlock scherzie

09:17.015 --> 09:18.348
is definitely living up
to her name.

09:18.350 --> 09:24.062

and ironically, so does ken.

09:24.106 --> 09:25.939
What? He does?

acoustic performance.

10:25.334 --> 10:29.085
But first, here's some
last clues to help you prepare

10:29.087 --> 10:30.712
your final guesses.

10:34.426 --> 10:35.884
Queen of hearts:
<i> When I was just a teenager,</i>

10:35.927 --> 10:37.636
<i> I wrote a letter</i>
<i> to my grandma.</i>

10:37.679 --> 10:39.262
<i> It read...</i>

10:51.485 --> 10:53.109
<i> But the truth?</i>

10:53.153 --> 10:55.654
<i> I left my job</i>
<i> because I had no choice,</i>

10:55.697 --> 10:56.988
<i> and I had no place to live.</i>

10:57.032 --> 11:00.950
- It's a suitcase.
- Travels. On the road a lot.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.494
<i> My car was stolen too.</i>

11:04.081 --> 11:06.122
<i> People did love</i>
<i> my music though,</i>

11:06.166 --> 11:07.999
<i> all three of them</i>
<i> that came to my show.</i>

11:08.043 --> 11:10.085
<i> I didn't tell her that though</i>

11:10.087 --> 11:11.836
<i> 'cause I wanted to fight</i>
<i> for the light</i>

11:11.880 --> 11:14.381
<i> more than I wanted to focus</i>
<i> on my bad circumstances.</i>

11:14.424 --> 11:16.675
- She's a fighter, though.
- She is a fighter.

11:16.718 --> 11:19.094
She don't give up. That's why
she's here in the final.

11:19.137 --> 11:21.096
<i> I still have</i>
<i> that letter today,</i>

11:21.139 --> 11:23.264
<i> and I hope my grandma</i>
<i> would be proud.</i>

11:23.308 --> 11:27.519
<i> Sometimes, the single</i>
<i> greatest act of defiance</i>

11:27.562 --> 11:29.187
<i> is shining your light</i>

11:29.231 --> 11:31.481
<i> no matter what</i>
<i> the world tells you.</i>

( chanting )
queen of hearts!
Queen of hearts!

13:31.561 --> 13:34.354
The queen of hearts.

13:34.397 --> 13:37.315
Dr. Ken jeong,
talk to the heart.

13:37.359 --> 13:41.611
I mean, what an amazing way
to end the season,

13:41.655 --> 13:42.987
and you being in the finale.

13:43.073 --> 13:48.117
Because all season long,
you've made every song your own.

13:48.119 --> 13:51.538
Your humanity just really
connects to us all,

13:51.581 --> 13:53.873
and you're a legend
in all of our hearts.

13:53.917 --> 13:56.042
Amazing job.

13:56.086 --> 14:00.296
I believe one of the things
that separates great artists

14:00.340 --> 14:03.383
are artists that write
love songs to humanity,

14:03.426 --> 14:07.178
love songs
to the everyday person

14:07.222 --> 14:09.389
to keep us inspired
and going on,

14:09.432 --> 14:12.600
and that is what
that song represents to me.

14:12.644 --> 14:16.187
There it is. So I got
to go back to the panel.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.147
Nicole,
who do you think it is?

14:18.191 --> 14:19.724
Whoo, okay, so this
is my little journey.

14:20.151 --> 14:25.154
In the beginning, obviously
you hear that real thick
southern accent, right?

14:25.156 --> 14:27.615
And then she was talking
about her troubled past,
so I was like, two words.

14:27.659 --> 14:29.284
"free britney."

14:31.204 --> 14:33.955
however, I'm not thinking
it's britney anymore.

14:33.999 --> 14:38.167
In this clue package,
we saw the ruby slippers.

14:38.211 --> 14:42.005
Jewel actually played dorothy
in "the wizard of oz" concert.

14:42.048 --> 14:46.926
And then we saw a briefcase,

14:46.970 --> 14:49.387
and her son
is actually named kase.

14:49.431 --> 14:52.682
- Ah, that's right.
- Nick: Jenny?

14:52.726 --> 14:55.184
Well, you guys ready to go
on a little trip with me?

14:55.228 --> 14:56.644
- Yes! Yes!
- Crowd: Yes.

14:56.688 --> 14:59.647
It might start off crazy,
but bear with me.

14:59.691 --> 15:00.732
When we first saw
queen of hearts,

15:01.026 --> 15:02.734
we heard a little bit of,
like, a rock and roll,

15:02.777 --> 15:06.154
and with those amazing
walking sticks, aka legs,

15:06.197 --> 15:09.449
I was thinking could this be,
like, a fergalicious?

15:09.451 --> 15:11.451
But then, don't worry,
I heard the southern accent,

15:11.494 --> 15:13.036
and I was like,
"okay, maybe this is,
like, a country singer."

15:13.079 --> 15:16.539
like a kellie pickler
or carrie underwood

15:16.541 --> 15:18.041
or faith hill, you know?

15:18.084 --> 15:19.167
And I landed on kellie pickler

15:19.210 --> 15:20.418
because the audience
clapped that day.

15:20.462 --> 15:23.087
Yes, kellie pickler,
not a bad choice.

15:23.131 --> 15:27.175
But I don't know.
This is driving me crazy.

15:27.218 --> 15:29.135
Well, if jenny's journey
was a little crazy,

15:29.179 --> 15:31.346
my journey's a little stupid.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.681
The very first time
we heard her,

15:33.725 --> 15:35.058
there was a judy garland clue.

15:35.101 --> 15:37.685
And there are oscar winners
in the bunch,

15:37.729 --> 15:39.854
so initially I was thinking
it could be renée zellweger,

15:39.898 --> 15:42.523
- who won an oscar for "judy."
- yes.

15:42.525 --> 15:44.651
But then when you're kind of
synthesizing everything today,

15:44.694 --> 15:48.821
someone who grew up poor
and really had such a journey

15:48.865 --> 15:50.406
and overcame
all these obstacles,

15:50.450 --> 15:53.618
it possibly
could be miranda lambert.

15:53.662 --> 15:56.537
- That's not stupid, ken.
That's okay!
- Oh, thank you.

15:56.539 --> 15:59.040
Well, I am so excited

15:59.084 --> 16:03.670
to see who you are
later tonight. Ta-dow!

16:03.672 --> 16:06.464
Nick:
You guys got to give it up for
another heartfelt performance.

16:06.508 --> 16:09.509
Thank you so much, queen.
Head on backstage.

16:11.262 --> 16:12.679
<i> We're loving</i>
<i> this season's guesses</i>

16:12.722 --> 16:13.763

<i> or royally wrong?</i>

<i> We find out tonight.</i>

16:18.937 --> 16:21.187
Don't forget that
"the masked singer" tour

16:21.231 --> 16:23.564
is coming to a town near you
next summer

16:23.608 --> 16:24.691
with celebrity hosts,

16:24.985 --> 16:28.361

16:52.053 --> 16:54.762
It's "the masked singer" finale.

16:54.764 --> 16:58.307
We're just two performances away
from announcing our winner,

16:58.351 --> 17:01.477
and the bull has been with us
from the very beginning.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.063
Before we hear his final
unplugged performance,

17:04.107 --> 17:06.357
let's watch
how this masked matador

17:06.401 --> 17:09.027
has mesmerized us
all season long.

17:13.074 --> 17:13.990
Not many people know this,

17:14.284 --> 17:16.826
but before this
"masked singer" experience,

17:16.870 --> 17:20.038
<i> I was in a place where</i>
<i> I was starting to second guess</i>

17:20.081 --> 17:22.081
<i> whether or not</i>
<i> I should keep performing.</i>

17:22.125 --> 17:23.332
( vocalizing )

17:23.376 --> 17:25.293
<i> it felt like no matter</i>
<i> how hard I worked,</i>

17:25.295 --> 17:28.087
<i> I was always going to be</i>
<i> limited because of who I am,</i>

17:28.131 --> 17:30.256
<i> how I am,</i>
<i> and what I stand for.</i>

17:30.300 --> 17:32.425
<i> And sometimes you wake up</i>
<i> and you're like,</i>

17:32.469 --> 17:34.802
<i> "is there a point</i>
<i> to keep moving forward?"</i>

17:34.846 --> 17:36.846
<i> I was ready to walk away</i>
<i> from it all.</i>

17:36.890 --> 17:38.765
- No way!
- Oh, angel.

17:38.767 --> 17:42.560
And then I got this call to
put on a bull costume and play,

17:42.562 --> 17:43.853
<i> and I answered.</i>

17:43.897 --> 17:45.688
<i> I said, "hello. Sign me up."</i>

20:53.628 --> 20:55.294
Nicole, I see the tears.

20:55.338 --> 20:59.215
Ooh, that song struck
a couple chords.

20:59.217 --> 21:03.427
We've all felt maybe invisible
sometimes, you know,

21:03.429 --> 21:05.221
but what's so beautiful is when
you have a gift like that,

21:05.265 --> 21:07.139
you make people feel seen.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.016
And because of that,
we truly see you.

You are the new voice
for "the masked singer,"

21:12.063 --> 21:15.022
and I am rooting for you
to take home

21:15.066 --> 21:16.983
"the masked singer"
golden trophy.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.526
Thank you.

21:20.280 --> 21:26.284
Uh, that song was written by
hunter hayes, who I love.

21:26.286 --> 21:27.243
And, um--

21:27.287 --> 21:29.453
- astronaut.
- Yes.

21:29.497 --> 21:35.293
And I felt like every
single lyric spoke to me, and...

21:35.336 --> 21:37.628
Take your time.
Take your time.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.048
Uh, I, um...

21:43.594 --> 21:45.011
crowd: Aww.

21:46.973 --> 21:49.724
Sometimes you just feel like

21:49.767 --> 21:52.810
there's nothing that
you'll ever be able to do
that's good enough.

21:52.854 --> 21:54.937
I do this because I love this.

21:54.939 --> 21:57.356
I've been doing it
since I was eight years old,

21:57.400 --> 22:01.527
and I'll never stop singing
no matter what happens.

22:03.323 --> 22:05.906
You know, what he talks about
and feeling invisible,

22:05.950 --> 22:08.200
growing up,
I tried to fit in.

22:08.202 --> 22:09.952
I tried to make friends
everywhere I went,

22:09.996 --> 22:11.579
and I found my home
at the piano.

22:11.622 --> 22:13.289
I found my home in music.

22:13.333 --> 22:15.207
You take everything
the world throws at you,

22:15.251 --> 22:17.043
take all the places
you don't belong,

22:17.086 --> 22:19.170
and you put it out
on that stage,
you put it in your voice.

22:19.213 --> 22:22.048
- Amen.
- God bless you and thank you.
- Yes, robin!

22:23.134 --> 22:26.802

this show has changed my life,

22:26.846 --> 22:32.099

confident than I ever have
inside this costume.

27:19.555 --> 27:23.432
I just have to say, this show
has been kind of magical.

27:23.434 --> 27:26.352
I've found that it touched
things in my own life

27:26.354 --> 27:29.855
from my history

27:29.899 --> 27:31.315

We are so excited for you.
Congratulations.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.652
Please make your way
to the winner's circle.

30:21.695 --> 30:25.197
Ladies and gentlemen, let's
keep it going for the bull.

30:25.241 --> 30:29.117
- Whoo!
- Oh, yeah.

30:29.119 --> 30:33.539
- He's an amazing runner up.
- We love you! We love you!

30:33.582 --> 30:37.251
First of all, any season,
you could've been a winner,
you would've been a finalist.

30:37.294 --> 30:38.126
You are that talented.

30:38.379 --> 30:40.921
Please never stop doing
what you love

30:40.965 --> 30:42.214
because that gift
that you have

30:42.216 --> 30:43.841
is meant to be shared
with the world.

30:43.884 --> 30:45.592
- Jenny: Totally.
- Ken: Absolutely.

30:45.636 --> 30:48.095
Well said, robin.

30:48.138 --> 30:51.890
But now we get to finally see
who the bull is.

30:51.934 --> 30:53.851
But before we do
the big reveal, panel,

30:53.894 --> 30:57.855
we must retrieve
your first impression guesses
for the bull.

30:57.898 --> 31:00.357
Men in black, bring them out.

31:01.944 --> 31:06.363
Remember, panel,
if your first impression
guess is correct,

31:06.407 --> 31:09.491
you get a point towards
the golden ear trophy.

31:09.493 --> 31:12.828
Ken and nicole
each have two points,

31:12.872 --> 31:14.955
and robin and jenny
each have one.

31:14.957 --> 31:16.081
- Nice.
- All right?

31:16.083 --> 31:18.166
- So it's still anybody's game.
- Whoo!

31:18.210 --> 31:21.044
Robin, your first impression
for the bull--

31:21.088 --> 31:24.214
- lil uzi vert.
- Jenny: Oh, my god.

31:24.258 --> 31:27.134
- The bull is dying.
- Nicole: Whoo!

31:27.177 --> 31:29.845
But this definitely
is not lil uzi vert.

31:29.889 --> 31:33.265
- Next season. Next season.
- Yeah. So who is this?

31:33.300 --> 31:36.184
Well,
he has physical gymnastics,
vocal gymnastics,

31:36.228 --> 31:39.229
and that's a very small
category of talents.

31:39.273 --> 31:40.355
Right.

31:40.399 --> 31:42.065
So I'm gonna go back
to my first guess.

31:42.109 --> 31:43.942
I'm thinking
maybe that's sisqó.

31:43.986 --> 31:46.028
- Nicole: Yes!
- Ken: Good guess.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.738
All right.
That's a great guess.

31:47.781 --> 31:52.075
Dr. Ken, your first
impression guess was ne-yo.

31:53.370 --> 31:55.078
- Oh.
- Not bad. Not bad.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.204
Nick:
Are you sticking with that?

31:56.248 --> 31:57.873
No, he's just wearing
his jacket.

31:57.908 --> 31:59.708
Nick: Ah!

31:59.752 --> 32:04.087
To me, only one person
can pull off these moves,

32:04.089 --> 32:07.007
be a triple threat,
and sing like that.

32:07.051 --> 32:09.551
I honestly think
you are taye diggs.

32:09.553 --> 32:12.888
Nicole: Oh, okay.

32:12.932 --> 32:15.223
Nick: Pretty good.
All right, well, jenny,

32:15.267 --> 32:17.351
your first impression
for the bull,

32:17.394 --> 32:18.644
brian littrell.

32:18.687 --> 32:20.062
- Ken: Oh.
- Robin: Okay.

32:20.064 --> 32:22.272
Jenny: You know,
I don't think it's him.

32:22.316 --> 32:25.734
This could possibly be, like,
a former broadway star.

32:25.778 --> 32:29.154
- Oh.
- Adam lambert kind of
goes along with that.

32:29.198 --> 32:32.324
Great voice. I think
this could be adam lambert.

32:32.368 --> 32:35.452
- Okay, that's a good one.
Adam lambert.
- Jenny: Thank you.

32:35.454 --> 32:36.620
That's pretty good.

32:36.664 --> 32:41.625
Now nicole believes
that this is todrick hall.

32:41.669 --> 32:45.170
- Robin: Ah.
- Jenny: Yes.

32:45.214 --> 32:48.173
I fo' sho'
am sticking with it.

32:48.217 --> 32:51.093
I've been keeping that guess
under the pillow.

32:51.095 --> 32:53.220
There's no one more talented.

32:53.263 --> 32:56.098
So I believe this is my bae,
my brother,

32:56.141 --> 32:59.393
my show-off partner in crime,
todrick hall.

32:59.436 --> 33:04.356
- I think nicole's en fuego.
- It would be amazing.

33:04.400 --> 33:07.150
So, all right, panel,
you've made your final guesses.

33:07.194 --> 33:09.152
Let's see if any
of you are correct.

33:09.196 --> 33:12.280
Bull, we need to know
who you are.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.908

34:00.831 --> 34:03.957
- Nicole, how long did it
take for you to know?
- Talk to her.

34:04.001 --> 34:07.294
Like, how many
eight counts was I performing
before your knew it was me?

34:07.337 --> 34:08.295
I knew right away.

34:08.589 --> 34:10.338
First of all,
me and todrick, that's, like,

that the world gets to see you,

34:15.637 --> 34:18.722
who you truly are.
I mean, you're an original.

34:18.766 --> 34:20.599
And you're leaving a legacy,
and I'm so grateful

34:20.642 --> 34:22.934
that "masked singer" gets to be
a part of that legacy.

34:22.978 --> 34:24.728
- Thank you.
- Indeed.

34:24.772 --> 34:26.396
Todrick:
Thank you so much.

34:26.565 --> 34:29.232
I do have to ask you, todrick,
because you talked about
not fitting in.

34:29.276 --> 34:32.027
Can you talk a little bit
more about that?

34:32.071 --> 34:35.238
I would just say
that we grow up

34:35.282 --> 34:37.866
and we believe in ourselves
so much as little kids.

34:37.910 --> 34:39.451
And then somewhere
along the line,

34:39.495 --> 34:41.870
the world starts
to pick apart at you,

34:41.914 --> 34:44.289
and they start to make you
realize the things about you
that are different.

34:44.333 --> 34:48.376
So I think that being inside
this costume gave me courage.

34:48.420 --> 34:52.172
And I've faced a lot of fears
on this show,

34:52.216 --> 34:54.049
but it always so fun
and so worth it to get up here

34:54.093 --> 34:56.218
and get your awesome,
amazing critiques every week.

34:56.261 --> 34:59.304
- God, you're amazing.
- Nick: There it is.

34:59.348 --> 35:03.391
And to sing one last time,
unmasked once and for all,

35:03.435 --> 35:06.302
the artist formerly known
as the bull.

35:06.313 --> 35:10.941
- Yes!

36:18.093 --> 36:21.219
Welcome back
to "the masked singer" finale.

36:21.254 --> 36:24.389
Just moments ago,
we found out queen of hearts

36:24.433 --> 36:27.434
- has joined past
golden mask winners...
- Whoo!

36:27.477 --> 36:31.354
<i> ...T-pain, wayne brady,</i>
<i> kandi burruss,</i>

36:31.398 --> 36:34.357
<i> leann rimes,</i>
<i> and nick lachey.</i>

36:34.401 --> 36:36.818
- Whoo!
- But whose famous face

36:36.862 --> 36:38.987
is behind the mask
of our champion?

36:39.031 --> 36:44.201
Let's retrieve the panel's
first impression guesses
from the vault.

36:44.203 --> 36:47.162
Men in black, bring them out.

36:47.206 --> 36:49.623
- Oh, no.
- No!

36:49.666 --> 36:54.002
Now this is gonna be
between ken and nicole.

36:54.037 --> 36:56.588
Since nicole
guessed bull correctly,

36:56.632 --> 36:58.215
she now leads ken by one.

36:58.258 --> 37:01.092
But ken could still tie
for the golden ear trophy.

37:01.094 --> 37:03.345
Oh, I'm gonna win.
I can't believe it.

37:03.388 --> 37:06.348
Before we get to the final two
who could win this trophy,

37:06.350 --> 37:09.392
let's go ahead and get
these other guys out of the way.

37:11.980 --> 37:15.982
Jenny, your first impression
guess was fergie.

37:17.402 --> 37:19.861
- But that's a good guess.
- Are you sticking with fergie?

37:19.905 --> 37:22.989
No. I'm gonna guess an artist
that I absolutely love.

37:23.033 --> 37:26.076
She was all about
early struggle in her life,

37:26.078 --> 37:28.078
famously lived out of her car.

37:28.080 --> 37:31.122
And that beautiful,
angelic voice is jewel.

37:31.124 --> 37:33.625
- Whoo!
- Nicole: Yes.

37:33.669 --> 37:37.087
You sound quite confident.
Robin, idina menzel.

37:37.130 --> 37:40.048
- Ooh.
- Are you sticking with that?

37:40.092 --> 37:42.842
No. It's not my first
impression guess,

37:42.886 --> 37:44.928
so I don't get
any credit for this,

37:44.972 --> 37:48.640
but it's hard to hear
anybody else but jewel
behind that beautiful heart.

37:48.684 --> 37:51.977
- All right.
- Ken: Good guess. Good guess.

37:51.979 --> 37:57.023
And now a person who possibly
could win the golden ear
trophy if he is correct.

37:57.067 --> 37:58.608
- Uh-oh.
- Oh, god.

37:58.652 --> 38:00.944
I want to thank
the masked singer academy.

38:00.946 --> 38:02.946
I would like to thank everybody.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.864
And most of all,
I would like to thank myself,

38:04.908 --> 38:06.574
because without me,
none of this would be possible.

38:06.618 --> 38:09.286
Go on, nick.

38:09.329 --> 38:11.288
Ken, your first
impression guess...

38:11.331 --> 38:12.455
Mm-hmm.

38:12.499 --> 38:13.623
Renée zellweger.

38:13.667 --> 38:15.917
Ken: Oh!

38:15.952 --> 38:17.502
Nick:
Are you sticking with it?

38:17.546 --> 38:21.006
Ken:
I am honestly thinking this
could be an oscar winner.

38:21.049 --> 38:24.175
And being a power vocalist, I--

38:24.219 --> 38:25.635
I got to win
that golden ear, jenny.

38:25.679 --> 38:27.887
- It's not gonna happen.
- It's not gonna happen.

38:27.931 --> 38:31.182
It will happen.
My life coach told me.

38:31.226 --> 38:33.351
So I'm sticking
with it, daddy. Boom!

38:33.395 --> 38:37.939
- Put it down.
- Oh, no. No.

38:37.941 --> 38:42.652
All right, well,
now to our potential
golden ear trophy winner,

38:42.696 --> 38:44.279
- sherlock scherzie.
- Oh, man.

38:44.698 --> 38:47.949
- Your first impression guess
of queen of hearts...
- You've got this, girl.

38:47.951 --> 38:49.951
...Was carrie underwood.

38:49.995 --> 38:51.953
- Nicole: That's right.
- Jenny: Oh, yeah.

38:51.955 --> 38:55.165
- Not bad.
- But I'm not
sticking with it.

38:55.208 --> 38:59.252
The rawness in her performances,
the authenticity,

38:59.296 --> 39:01.588
but most important,
this queen can yodel.

39:01.631 --> 39:03.798
This is jewel, you all!

39:03.842 --> 39:05.884
- Ken: Good guess.
- Jenny: Yes.

39:05.886 --> 39:09.763
All right.
Panel, you've made
your final guesses.

39:09.806 --> 39:13.099
Queen of hearts, it's time
to show your famous face.

39:13.101 --> 39:15.643
- Yes!
- Audience, say it with me.

39:15.687 --> 39:19.939

39:44.966 --> 39:48.301

Amazing.

- Wow!

39:53.100 --> 39:55.934
- Hi, guys!
- What a vision!

39:55.936 --> 39:59.354
- Whoo!
- Such an honor,

39:59.398 --> 40:01.523
such a pleasure
to have you here!

40:01.566 --> 40:05.068
- Yes!
- Oh, my god.

40:05.070 --> 40:07.779
- Hi, guys!
- Love you, jewel!

40:07.781 --> 40:11.533
Nick: So how does it feel to win
the golden mask trophy?

40:11.535 --> 40:13.326
Aww, it is just an honor.

40:13.370 --> 40:17.789
It really is an honor
to be in the hall of costumes

40:17.833 --> 40:20.250
and with the other
amazing winners.

40:20.293 --> 40:22.585
And everybody was so talented
on this show.

40:22.629 --> 40:23.920
Yes. Here, here.

40:23.964 --> 40:25.380
- Amen. Amen.
- Here, here.

40:25.424 --> 40:27.549
And it's just
the privilege of a lifetime

40:27.592 --> 40:29.175
to get to be yourself.

40:29.219 --> 40:32.137
This show oddly really
gets at your essence,

40:32.180 --> 40:33.638
and I find that really special
about this show.

40:33.849 --> 40:36.224
- Wow.
- Oh, my gosh, jewel, yes.

40:37.060 --> 40:38.893
And it really reminded me

40:38.895 --> 40:41.354
of, you know,
before I was famous,
singing in a coffee shop,

40:41.398 --> 40:45.316
and to be able to just have
people react to your voice

40:45.360 --> 40:47.610
not knowing anything else
was really touching.

40:47.654 --> 40:50.029
I'm not a cool person,
I never have been,

40:50.073 --> 40:52.991
but I have a lot of heart,
and that's why I wanted
to be the heart.

40:53.034 --> 40:56.536
- Aww.
- And to be able to win on that
meant the world to me.

40:56.580 --> 40:58.329
So thank you, guys.
I really appreciate it.

40:58.373 --> 41:02.959
- Well, congratulations again.
- Thank you, baby.

41:03.003 --> 41:05.086
- Well deserved.
- Thank you!

41:05.130 --> 41:08.381
And while we're saying
congratulations,

41:08.425 --> 41:12.510
nicole, with three correct
first impression guesses...

41:12.554 --> 41:14.304
- What?
- You're the new winner

41:14.347 --> 41:17.182
of our golden ear trophy.

41:17.225 --> 41:23.146
- Yeah! Nicole!
- Jenny: Nicole!

41:24.024 --> 41:25.440
I feel like halle berry

41:25.484 --> 41:29.068
when she won the oscar
for "monster's ball."

41:29.112 --> 41:32.614
this moment is so much
bigger than me.
