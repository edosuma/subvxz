01:01.675 --> 01:03.677
It's 7:15, you guys.

01:12.419 --> 01:14.456
- You're gonna be late.
- I know.

01:23.898 --> 01:26.435
- God, that guy's such an ass.
- Stacey.

01:26.600 --> 01:30.810
- What? He almost just ran me over.
- You shouldn't be getting out that side.

01:30.971 --> 01:33.645
Go out that side.
Hey, honey, did you get the list?

01:33.807 --> 01:35.343
- I've already done it.
- Great.

01:35.509 --> 01:36.613
- Of course.
- Really?

01:36.777 --> 01:38.279
- Girls.
- I hear it all day.

01:38.445 --> 01:41.392
"Your sister was a great student.
Emma loved this book."

01:41.548 --> 01:43.255
Stace, enough.

01:43.417 --> 01:45.829
I have a showing at 5.
I'll be home around 6.

01:45.986 --> 01:48.694
- Dinner requests?
- Anything's good. Bye, Mom.

01:48.856 --> 01:50.199
Bye, sweetie. I love you.

01:50.357 --> 01:52.769
She's the perfect girl
and I'm the bad sister.

01:53.427 --> 01:55.498
No, you're not.
Have a great day, honey.

01:56.297 --> 01:59.506
Breathe, Em. They're probably
gonna talk about stuff we know.

01:59.667 --> 02:02.147
I'm only going
to get out of first period.

02:02.303 --> 02:04.476
- We can be a little late.
- Not really.

02:04.638 --> 02:07.778
Oh, my dog, you're going to explode
if you stay this tight.

02:09.043 --> 02:10.818
Speaking of tight...

02:11.912 --> 02:13.516
Hey, Emma.

02:15.149 --> 02:17.891
"Hey, Emma"?
He fricking knows your name.

02:18.052 --> 02:20.430
- I guess.
- Stephen Sullivan knows your name.

02:20.587 --> 02:24.933
- Can we go to class now, please?
- Will you sleep with him? For me.

02:26.527 --> 02:28.268
All right, listen up, everybody.

02:28.429 --> 02:31.273
The bus will be leaving
at 7 a.m. sharp tomorrow...

02:31.432 --> 02:34.208
so be on time. Otherwise...

02:35.803 --> 02:36.838
Sony, prom queen.

02:37.004 --> 02:38.915
- Hey, find a seat. Let's go.
- What?

02:39.073 --> 02:42.680
I expect it from Mr. McMullen,
but I'd hope better from you, Emma.

02:42.843 --> 02:44.982
- Sony, Mr. Christiansen.
- All right.

02:45.145 --> 02:49.560
So tomorrow the bus will be leaving
at 7 a.m. sharp, all right?

02:49.717 --> 02:53.688
Be on time or the bus
will be leaving without you.

02:53.854 --> 02:58.428
How'd Lonely Boy get on this trip?
Daddy probably bought his way on.

02:58.592 --> 03:00.970
- What?
- You know I can hear you, right?

03:02.629 --> 03:04.006
For the first five days...

03:04.164 --> 03:07.634
...we'll be helping to renovate a school
with Project Humanity.

03:07.801 --> 03:10.577
The last three days,
we'll be exploring the island...

03:10.738 --> 03:16.017
...and going on cultural excursions,
and it should be a lot of fun.

03:19.079 --> 03:23.118
So headline:
Stephen knows Emma's name.

03:23.283 --> 03:25.889
- Say what?
- I'll trade you for your burger.

03:26.420 --> 03:28.297
- You can have it.
- You sure?

03:28.455 --> 03:31.800
- Yeah, I just wanted the fries.
- Okay, so Emma and Stephen?

03:31.959 --> 03:33.404
- I kind of like that.
- Yeah.

03:33.560 --> 03:36.234
We have one week on the island
to work our magic...

03:36.397 --> 03:38.900
...and get Emma here
laid by the quarterback.

03:39.066 --> 03:41.342
- Do I have a say in this?
- No, not at all.

03:41.502 --> 03:44.779
- We're there to be helping people.
- I'm trying to "help" you.

03:44.938 --> 03:47.612
We have jobs to do.
I have looked at the itinerary.

03:47.775 --> 03:50.051
You made the itinerary.

03:50.210 --> 03:53.350
The school has every day
and night planned.

03:53.514 --> 03:55.960
So? We'll change the plans.
That's life, right?

03:56.116 --> 03:58.255
Oh, and BT-dubs, I just found out...

03:58.419 --> 04:00.922
...carnival in Trinidad
is when we're there.

04:01.088 --> 04:04.399
Oh, my God.
I totally have to get a new bathing suit.

04:04.558 --> 04:06.595
- Really?
- What?

04:06.760 --> 04:10.765
- Emma's scoping Lonely Boy.
- Oh, he was in my middle school.

04:10.931 --> 04:13.411
- He used to be really nice.
- Yeah, used to be.

04:13.567 --> 04:16.446
I heard he got kicked out
of the last school he was in.

04:16.603 --> 04:18.082
I think he's kind of cute...

04:18.238 --> 04:21.378
...in a Rebel Without a Cause,
Holden Caulfield kind of way.

04:21.541 --> 04:22.748
Let me make it simple.

04:22.910 --> 04:26.357
Girls like our Em don't hook up
with freaks like what's-his-face.

04:26.513 --> 04:29.323
Especially when she's got
the quarterback on the hook.

04:29.483 --> 04:30.655
You can hand me that.

04:30.818 --> 04:31.853
- Busted!
- Loser.

04:32.019 --> 04:35.489
- Follow me to the principal's office.
- Well, then lead the way.

04:38.859 --> 04:40.668
- Way to go, pal.
- Well done.

04:40.828 --> 04:43.399
Looks like someone's
not going on the trip.

04:45.499 --> 04:48.173
<i>Well, folks,
it looks like we're in for another...</i>

04:48.335 --> 04:51.145
Wow, how long you planning
on staying?

04:51.305 --> 04:54.149
You can never be too prepared, Phil.

04:54.308 --> 04:56.447
Thank you guys so much
for letting me go.

04:58.112 --> 05:02.117
So I had to take a second mortgage out
and Mom has to sell an extra mansion.

05:02.282 --> 05:04.023
Don't tell her that.

05:07.454 --> 05:10.264
I love our kids so much.

05:10.424 --> 05:14.873
If this is for an eight-day trip, what's
it gonna be like to send her to college?

05:15.028 --> 05:16.371
I know.

05:17.231 --> 05:19.905
I'm thinking we have to move
to Princeton with you.

05:20.067 --> 05:22.547
- I support that idea. Yep.
- Right?

05:22.703 --> 05:24.614
Wouldn't you love that?

05:24.771 --> 05:27.115
What are you talking about,
you don't wanna go?

05:27.274 --> 05:30.221
Know what strings I had to pull
to get you on this trip?

05:30.377 --> 05:32.379
For who, Dad, me or you?

05:32.546 --> 05:34.992
I don't even wanna go
on this stupid trip.

05:35.149 --> 05:38.460
I'm gonna be forced to hang
with people I never talk to anyway.

05:38.619 --> 05:40.929
It's an opportunity, son.

05:43.023 --> 05:46.470
It's a chance to do something
for someone other than yourself.

05:48.962 --> 05:50.600
Can we go? We're gonna be late.

05:50.764 --> 05:54.143
I'd be stuck here, and you'd have
to look at my face all week.

05:57.371 --> 06:00.648
Let's go, gang. All aboard!

06:00.807 --> 06:02.184
- Be careful.
- Emma, Lizzie.

06:02.342 --> 06:03.377
- Be safe.
- Say bye.

06:03.544 --> 06:07.151
- Love you.
- Let's get a move. Come on.

06:07.614 --> 06:10.720
Dean, be safe.

06:10.884 --> 06:12.830
Will do, Father.

06:19.827 --> 06:21.932
How you doing, Emma?
Crazy early, right?

06:23.263 --> 06:25.607
That was two sentences.
He's upping his game.

06:25.766 --> 06:27.575
You are so getting laid.

06:39.012 --> 06:42.323
Okay, everybody, listen up.
Project starts tomorrow.

06:42.482 --> 06:46.430
We have a few hours today
to get settled in and hang by the pool.

06:46.587 --> 06:48.965
Then we're all gonna go
have dinner.

06:49.790 --> 06:52.134
What'd I tell you, Em?
Screw your schedule.

06:52.292 --> 06:55.239
This is gonna be the best ever.

07:10.043 --> 07:15.049
No locals. Damn. Oh, well.
Who's the lucky boy?

07:15.215 --> 07:19.095
Don't worry, Em.
I'm not gonna steal your quarterback.

07:19.820 --> 07:23.666
All right, ladies. Let's do this.

07:23.824 --> 07:26.236
One, two...

07:27.961 --> 07:30.032
Yeah, ladies.

07:37.237 --> 07:39.444
Don't splash me.

07:45.946 --> 07:47.084
- Gotcha.
- No!

08:08.268 --> 08:11.010
All right, man, good job.
Spread it out now.

08:11.171 --> 08:15.779
- Hey, hey, hey. Be careful up there.
- Whatever you say, boss.

08:15.943 --> 08:19.152
He's gonna get freaking killed
and ruin it for all of us.

08:21.782 --> 08:25.525
You should get some lotion
on your shoulders. You're gonna burn.

08:28.922 --> 08:31.960
Day two
and first contact has been made?

08:32.125 --> 08:33.195
Yes, please.

08:33.693 --> 08:35.696
This is gonna be easier
than I thought.

08:35.861 --> 08:39.674
Looks like Mama's
getting some vac-action.

08:41.668 --> 08:43.044
Game on, dudes.

08:43.203 --> 08:44.841
- Skyping.
- With the 'rentals.

08:45.005 --> 08:47.315
Okay, get off now.
Seriously, it's urgent.

08:47.474 --> 08:49.476
<i>Honey, are you all right?</i>

08:50.177 --> 08:53.090
Yeah. Sony, Ms. Collier
is calling lights out.

08:53.246 --> 08:55.487
<i>All right, go ahead.
We love you. Have fun.</i>

08:55.649 --> 08:58.152
<i>- Get a good night's sleep, babe.
- Love you. Bye.</i>

08:58.318 --> 08:59.592
<i>- B ye, honey.
- Good night.</i>

08:59.753 --> 09:01.664
I'm downstairs buying toothpaste...

09:01.822 --> 09:04.530
...because I ran out.
Can you believe they charge--?

09:04.691 --> 09:05.999
- Losing.
- Okay.

09:06.159 --> 09:10.107
Headline: Carnival party tonight
on some local dude's boat. I know.

09:10.263 --> 09:13.870
And Stephen invited us,
and he singled you out, young Emma.

09:14.034 --> 09:17.277
They're leaving right now,
but the boat leaves in a half-hour.

09:17.437 --> 09:19.474
- I don't know.
- Shut it.

09:19.639 --> 09:21.380
We are going. You are going...

09:21.541 --> 09:24.522
...even if I have to tie you up
and drag you to the boat.

09:24.678 --> 09:26.589
Seriously, we'll be done
by midnight.

09:27.748 --> 09:29.955
- Two o'clock, the latest.
- Okay.

09:30.117 --> 09:31.289
Yeah!

09:32.119 --> 09:33.352
Carnival!

09:37.090 --> 09:38.933
Thank you.

09:41.595 --> 09:43.370
Want a taxi?

09:50.036 --> 09:51.071
Go.

09:51.938 --> 09:54.748
Carnival, bitches!

09:55.942 --> 09:57.944
Hurry, we're gonna miss it.

10:01.948 --> 10:04.019
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

10:04.184 --> 10:06.664
- Don't leave.
- Run for it.

10:23.370 --> 10:25.714
This is so fun.

10:25.872 --> 10:28.580
- Hey, ladies, what's up?
- Oh, no, that's okay.

10:34.681 --> 10:38.629
Okay, let's get a cocktail
and find your man.

10:38.785 --> 10:40.992
Not my man and not drinking.

10:41.154 --> 10:44.328
Em, you've gotta loosen up.
You know, switch it around.

10:44.491 --> 10:47.597
- Get out of your element just a little.
- I like my element.

10:56.703 --> 10:58.512
I'm gonna go find Helen.

11:21.695 --> 11:23.971
Is that your new boyfriend?

11:24.498 --> 11:25.977
What's it to you?

11:27.801 --> 11:29.474
<i>Monte Carlo.</i>

11:32.439 --> 11:33.474
<i>Monte Carlo.</i>

11:34.641 --> 11:36.382
Prepare to be boarded.

11:38.044 --> 11:41.082
Monte Carlo,
this is the Trinidad Police.

11:41.248 --> 11:43.421
Heave to
and prepare to be boarded.

11:45.185 --> 11:47.995
Move to the front of the boat.

11:48.755 --> 11:51.361
Move to the bow of the boat.

11:52.325 --> 11:55.204
Monte Carlo,
this is the Trinidad Police.

11:56.029 --> 11:58.373
- Emma!
- Help!

11:58.532 --> 12:00.205
This is the Trinidad Police.

12:00.367 --> 12:02.745
- What the hell are you doing?
- I fell.

12:02.903 --> 12:05.679
- Where's Emma?
- I thought she was with you.

12:05.839 --> 12:06.943
Climb up.

12:12.779 --> 12:15.385
- You all right?
- Just great.

12:16.183 --> 12:17.253
What are you doing?

12:17.417 --> 12:19.954
I'm in enough trouble.
I can't get busted.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.963
You crazy? We'll dodge the cops?

12:22.122 --> 12:25.194
We'll be fine. We'll go to the hotel
when things cool down.

12:25.358 --> 12:28.339
On this?
I wanna get back on the boat.

12:35.068 --> 12:38.515
- They're getting too far away.
- We'll hang back and follow them.

12:39.005 --> 12:40.575
- We'll be fine.
- Hurry.

12:40.740 --> 12:42.481
We won't be able to see the boat.

12:42.642 --> 12:45.248
- How we gonna get out of here?
- I'm working on it.

12:45.412 --> 12:48.621
- Do you even know which way to go?
- Be quiet. Let me think.

12:48.782 --> 12:52.491
- Damn it, no motor.
- No motor? What now, genius?

12:52.852 --> 12:56.265
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

12:56.423 --> 12:59.802
We're stuck out here.
This isn't some stupid little thing--

13:00.393 --> 13:02.236
Hold on.

13:05.498 --> 13:09.913
Please put your suitcases by the door
to be loaded into the awaiting cabs.

13:10.070 --> 13:11.811
I'd like to thank those of you...

13:11.972 --> 13:15.545
...who brought this unique opportunity
to an abrupt end.

13:15.709 --> 13:17.985
Welcome, gentlemen.
Glad you could make it.

13:18.144 --> 13:20.090
Too bad you're on your way home.

13:20.247 --> 13:23.751
- Ms. Collier, Emma's not here.
- What?

13:25.752 --> 13:27.390
She never came home last night.

13:27.554 --> 13:31.195
I didn't tell anyone because I thought
she was with someone, but--

13:31.358 --> 13:33.861
Okay, well,
how do you know that she's not?

13:34.027 --> 13:37.497
You know her. She wouldn't just bail
She has a schedule to keep.

13:37.664 --> 13:39.735
I tried her cell. She's not answering.

13:39.899 --> 13:42.379
All right, well,
where did you see her last?

13:44.137 --> 13:45.971
On the boat.

13:57.117 --> 14:00.690
- How far do you think we've drifted?
- I don't know. Keep an eye out.

14:00.854 --> 14:03.596
- Can't be that far.
- We've been out here for hours.

14:03.757 --> 14:05.737
Was this pan of your brilliant plan?

14:12.165 --> 14:16.204
- I can't believe my phone got soaked.
- Yeah, I can't believe that either.

14:16.369 --> 14:17.507
Try your phone again.

14:18.438 --> 14:21.681
I told you,
I'm not getting reception out here.

14:23.677 --> 14:26.283
- You want some more water?
- Thanks.

14:32.018 --> 14:34.362
I can't believe you brought water
to a party.

14:34.521 --> 14:37.502
I didn't wanna get dehydrated.
That gives you a hangover.

14:37.657 --> 14:40.069
Really? I thought it was the tequila.

14:42.195 --> 14:47.008
I still can't believe there's no motor.
That's the point of the dinghy, right?

14:47.167 --> 14:49.613
For emergencies.
Why else have the damn dinghy?

14:49.769 --> 14:53.114
- What? How is that funny?
-"Dinghy's" funny.

14:53.707 --> 14:55.414
It's a funny word, "dinghy."

14:55.909 --> 14:57.616
We're floating in the Caribbean.

14:57.777 --> 15:00.656
- You know that, right?
- Yeah.

15:00.814 --> 15:05.661
I also know freaking out isn't gonna
make us any less screwed, so...

15:06.152 --> 15:07.825
So, what do we do?

15:07.987 --> 15:12.766
For now, we float, I guess.

15:15.628 --> 15:17.505
Want some gum?

15:17.664 --> 15:19.109
Why, is my breath bad?

15:19.766 --> 15:20.801
Probably.

15:27.374 --> 15:29.786
- Elizabeth Kover.
- Here.

15:30.944 --> 15:32.082
Samuel Leif er.

15:33.012 --> 15:34.992
- Here.
- Dean McMullen.

15:37.250 --> 15:41.062
Dean? Dean McMullen?
Anyone seen Dean?

15:48.395 --> 15:50.966
- You should try that.
- No, thanks.

15:51.731 --> 15:53.267
You want me to get your back?

15:55.468 --> 15:58.472
- What's with all the Ziplocs?
- What?

15:59.439 --> 16:01.316
You carry all your crap in baggies?

16:01.975 --> 16:03.852
It keeps things from getting messy.

16:04.644 --> 16:08.114
- How's that working out for you?
- Well, at least my phone is dry.

16:13.586 --> 16:16.294
We should've followed the police boat
back to shore.

16:16.456 --> 16:19.266
- What, with a single paddle? Sure.
- I'm just saying.

16:19.425 --> 16:22.463
First of all, I figured we'd be able
to row back in later.

16:22.629 --> 16:26.441
Second, lest we forget, prom queen,
you decided to take a dip...

16:26.599 --> 16:29.443
-...in stormy waters.
- I fell off the boat.

16:29.602 --> 16:31.513
And my name is Emma.

16:32.605 --> 16:34.312
Okay, Emma.

16:36.876 --> 16:39.720
- Oh, my God.
- What?

16:39.879 --> 16:42.951
- Island, there.
- Where?

16:43.116 --> 16:45.960
- Right there. Okay.
- Oh, that's way too far.

16:46.119 --> 16:48.531
We should sit here
until someone picks us up.

16:48.688 --> 16:50.190
Are you kidding?

16:50.356 --> 16:52.700
- Fine, I'll paddle.
- Okay, okay.

16:53.193 --> 16:55.901
I'll paddle. Jeez.

17:03.937 --> 17:05.916
She never made it back to the hotel?

17:06.071 --> 17:08.915
- No. I thought maybe she was--
- Was she drinking?

17:09.075 --> 17:11.281
- What's that have to do with anything?
- Was she with Dean?

17:11.478 --> 17:14.253
- What? No.
- But he was on the boat?

17:14.414 --> 17:18.191
Yeah, but she didn't meet anyone.
And she wasn't hooking up with Dean.

17:18.351 --> 17:21.560
- Ms. Collier, tell them--
- Can anything be done to find them?

17:21.721 --> 17:23.598
More than likely, they'll find you.

17:23.756 --> 17:27.897
This type of thing isn't uncommon.
It's the youthful spirit of adventure.

17:28.060 --> 17:31.440
No, this is my best friend
we're talking about. I know her.

17:31.598 --> 17:33.908
She has no youthful spirit
of adventure.

17:55.355 --> 17:56.766
Dean!

18:26.586 --> 18:27.621
You okay?

18:28.888 --> 18:30.629
Yeah.

18:30.790 --> 18:32.269
You?

18:33.493 --> 18:35.905
Yeah. Think so.

18:38.398 --> 18:40.935
No coverage.
We'll have to find a phone.

18:41.834 --> 18:43.336
Great.

18:48.708 --> 18:49.743
Well, wait up.

19:00.453 --> 19:01.488
Come on.

19:08.294 --> 19:10.103
Really? Who's that for?

19:11.264 --> 19:14.006
I don't know. Shoot the bad guys?

19:17.637 --> 19:20.743
No, you finish it.
I could use a coffee.

19:20.907 --> 19:23.513
Like a mocha ice blended
with an extra shot.

19:23.676 --> 19:25.986
Oh, man. How good would that be?

19:30.817 --> 19:33.525
- What was that?
- I hate bugs.

19:34.387 --> 19:37.095
Well, you've come
to the right place, then.

19:37.257 --> 19:39.134
Let's just find a hotel.

19:39.292 --> 19:41.272
We finish working
on the school today.

19:41.427 --> 19:44.033
I'll bet everyone's probably
all worried about us.

19:44.197 --> 19:47.804
You, maybe. I can promise you
nobody's worried about me.

19:49.335 --> 19:51.144
Yeah, this is Jack.

19:53.539 --> 19:54.847
I'm sorry, what?

19:56.676 --> 19:59.555
- Excuse me. Mrs. Robinson?
- Barbara.

19:59.712 --> 20:03.524
- Jack McMullen. I'm Dean's father.
- Nice to meet you.

20:06.252 --> 20:09.392
What were they doing on the boat,
and who was watching them?

20:09.555 --> 20:11.762
- Now, Mrs. Rob--
- Don't condescend to me.

20:11.925 --> 20:16.396
Don't you dare condescend to me.
I trusted you with our daughter.

20:16.562 --> 20:18.041
They can't find her.

20:18.197 --> 20:20.871
It's okay, we'll find her.
When is the next flight?

20:21.034 --> 20:24.277
There's a redeye tonight
that makes connections in Trinidad.

20:24.437 --> 20:27.213
- There's not an earlier flight?
- That's the earliest.

20:27.373 --> 20:29.182
I can help you with arrangements--

20:29.342 --> 20:31.481
You've done enough.
Thank you. Let's go.

20:33.246 --> 20:37.456
- My feet are killing me.
- I fricking hate hiking.

20:40.486 --> 20:43.399
- You wanna wear my Chucks?
- It's okay.

20:44.157 --> 20:45.830
Thanks, though.

20:48.961 --> 20:50.736
Hey, look.

20:52.665 --> 20:54.667
- Stop.
- What? They're berries.

20:54.834 --> 20:58.475
White and yellow, kill a fellow.
Purple and blue, good for you.

21:01.341 --> 21:04.220
You're a little bit weird.
You know that, right?

21:04.377 --> 21:06.379
Been called worse.

21:36.242 --> 21:38.222
Oh, my...

21:43.149 --> 21:44.526
It's beautiful.

21:48.254 --> 21:50.200
Come on. We gotta keep going.

21:50.356 --> 21:51.994
- Let's just find a hotel.
- What?

21:53.426 --> 21:55.838
We may never get back here again.

21:58.030 --> 22:01.637
- Come on. Take a picture.
- We're already in enough trouble.

22:01.801 --> 22:05.146
You know they grade this trip.
I cannot mess with my GPA.

22:06.072 --> 22:09.315
Hello? Do you know
how unique this is?

22:10.409 --> 22:12.821
Okay.
What's your number-one school?

22:13.246 --> 22:14.384
Princeton. Why?

22:15.882 --> 22:19.159
You know how many people
applying to Princeton have a 4.0?

22:19.785 --> 22:21.287
A lot.

22:21.454 --> 22:24.230
You know how many people
have been swimming in this?

22:24.390 --> 22:26.529
Think of the essay you could write.

22:27.426 --> 22:28.734
Come on.

22:29.796 --> 22:31.867
We gotta find a hotel.

22:33.366 --> 22:36.404
So lame. Fine.

22:36.569 --> 22:39.448
See, this is why I don't hang out
with people.

23:00.026 --> 23:02.404
I can't wait
until we get to a real bathroom.

23:02.562 --> 23:04.735
I can't wait for a coffee.

23:28.254 --> 23:30.200
Where are we?

23:34.660 --> 23:37.140
We've been walking for hours.

23:37.296 --> 23:40.743
And we haven't seen
a single road, person.

23:42.401 --> 23:44.574
We better get back to the boat.

23:46.005 --> 23:48.485
Come on, it's gonna be along walk.

24:03.756 --> 24:06.430
What if we have to spend the night
on this island?

24:06.592 --> 24:09.801
I don't think we're gonna find
a five-star hotel around here.

24:09.962 --> 24:13.341
- Do you know how to make a fire?
- I do.

24:17.970 --> 24:20.473
- Perfect.
- What?

24:25.111 --> 24:26.784
A cave?

24:28.214 --> 24:30.558
I am not sleeping in a cave.

24:30.716 --> 24:34.391
It's the safest place to be.
Dry if it rains, only one way in.

24:34.553 --> 24:36.658
Protection from the elements.

24:36.822 --> 24:38.824
Hey, can I use your phone?

24:38.991 --> 24:41.528
Sure. There's no signal.

24:43.996 --> 24:47.876
- I'm not a cave person.
- None of us are cave persons.

24:48.034 --> 24:50.844
We haven't been cave people
for a long...

24:52.838 --> 24:54.875
<i>Go, 90, go.-</i>

25:02.615 --> 25:06.791
So that's a no on the cave.

25:14.227 --> 25:16.104
Where's the boat?

25:56.168 --> 25:58.375
I'm really tired.

25:58.537 --> 26:00.175
Can we take a break soon?

26:00.339 --> 26:02.683
- Sure.
- Thanks.

26:16.889 --> 26:18.800
You see something?

26:18.958 --> 26:20.528
No.

26:20.693 --> 26:23.196
Use the flare gun.
You need at least two flares.

26:23.362 --> 26:24.898
I saw it in a book.

26:25.064 --> 26:29.103
I think it was the one with the girl who
sails around the world with her cat.

26:29.268 --> 26:31.908
You fire two flares,
one to get their attention...

26:32.071 --> 26:34.381
...and the other
so they can locate you.

26:34.540 --> 26:35.610
Who's "they"?

26:35.775 --> 26:38.312
The people that are gonna
come get us, I guess.

26:38.744 --> 26:41.247
Our families and the police
or whoever.

26:45.551 --> 26:47.656
Dean, what are you doing?

27:00.499 --> 27:01.603
What was that about?

27:03.602 --> 27:06.173
Hey, can I borrow
some of that bug stuff?

27:06.339 --> 27:08.819
- Sure.
- Thanks.

27:08.974 --> 27:11.580
- You want a pillow?
- Thanks.

27:16.649 --> 27:19.323
- Wait a sec.
- What?

27:24.256 --> 27:26.793
Damn, you should be
on that Price Is Right show.

27:26.959 --> 27:28.404
I knew it was in here.

27:28.561 --> 27:32.907
I put it in there in case I got hungry
when we were building yesterday.

27:35.101 --> 27:36.603
Thanks.

27:37.336 --> 27:40.579
And I think you meant
Let's Make a Deal.

27:43.909 --> 27:45.479
Right.

27:45.644 --> 27:46.952
That show.

27:51.851 --> 27:54.058
- Here's some more.
- Thanks.

28:02.161 --> 28:07.270
<i>Flight 415 from Detroit to Miami
scheduled to depart at 11 p. m...</i>

28:07.433 --> 28:12.576
<i>...is now expected to depart
at 12:10 a.m. from Gate 211.</i>

28:12.738 --> 28:14.615
We're gonna get there.

28:28.921 --> 28:30.832
Why do you call me "prom queen"?

28:31.824 --> 28:33.963
- Aren't you?
- No.

28:34.126 --> 28:38.438
You seem like you should be.
Perfect girl, perfect world.

28:38.597 --> 28:41.510
I can't tell if you're being
mean or nice.

28:48.774 --> 28:51.983
What do you think's out there?
In the woods.

28:52.978 --> 28:56.255
- We're gonna be fine.
- I know.

29:02.021 --> 29:04.433
- Still can't get a signal.
- Here.

29:08.193 --> 29:11.072
What are you doing?
You're gonna waste the battery.

29:11.230 --> 29:13.232
Just playing some music.

29:20.206 --> 29:21.708
Here.

29:21.874 --> 29:23.820
- Take my shin.
- Thank you.

29:23.976 --> 29:25.512
Sure.

29:33.219 --> 29:35.859
- Night.
- Night.

29:38.324 --> 29:41.362
They'll come for us. I know it.

29:46.699 --> 29:48.303
What was that?

30:41.854 --> 30:43.356
<i>Hey.-</i>

30:43.522 --> 30:45.866
You're a morning person, huh?

30:46.659 --> 30:48.229
What are you doing?

30:48.394 --> 30:51.170
I'm trying to save us.
What are you doing?

30:51.330 --> 30:53.674
I don't know. Might go for a swim.

30:56.001 --> 30:58.481
- Hey, where's your phone?
- Battery's dead.

31:03.075 --> 31:05.214
We need some more water.

31:42.748 --> 31:46.525
The police have a boat searching
the area where they picked up the kids.

31:46.685 --> 31:49.564
- As soon as they come back--
- When will they be back?

31:49.721 --> 31:50.756
I'm not sure.

31:50.923 --> 31:53.631
- They said they'd let us know when--
- Any word?

31:53.792 --> 31:58.104
I was just telling Barbara the police
have a boat searching the Caribbean.

31:58.263 --> 32:00.265
They did say
that a dinghy was missing.

32:00.432 --> 32:02.969
- How long they been looking?
- What about a helicopter?

32:03.135 --> 32:06.344
As soon as the winds die down,
they're gonna send someone up.

32:06.505 --> 32:09.748
Have they been searching land?
Have you contacted the embassy?

32:09.908 --> 32:11.819
Is there a private team we can hire?

32:11.977 --> 32:14.480
The police are doing everything
that they can...

32:14.646 --> 32:17.092
...with the limited resources
that they have.

32:17.249 --> 32:19.388
There is no private rescue team.

32:19.551 --> 32:21.827
But they did say
they were very confident...

32:21.987 --> 32:24.092
...they're going to find
Dean and Emma.

32:24.256 --> 32:26.827
The first 48 hours
is the most important.

32:26.992 --> 32:30.667
- But the chief said that kids do this
- If I hear one more time...

32:30.829 --> 32:31.864
Are you kidding me?

32:32.030 --> 32:34.533
It's been two days.
What are these people doing?

32:34.700 --> 32:38.705
Except offering anecdotal crap
about other teenagers.

32:40.639 --> 32:43.643
- All right, look, I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

32:44.343 --> 32:46.584
Help us find our children.

33:15.174 --> 33:17.677
The hut's gonna be something
in case it rains.

33:17.843 --> 33:19.516
Rain?

33:19.678 --> 33:21.419
You never know.

33:30.189 --> 33:32.760
You okay? Come here.

33:36.028 --> 33:39.202
This may sting a little.
Does that hurt?

33:41.433 --> 33:43.310
Here, keep the pressure on it.

33:48.674 --> 33:51.382
So why Princeton?

33:53.412 --> 33:57.053
- Why do you wanna go to Princeton?
- I don't know.

33:57.216 --> 33:59.822
- It's Ivy League.
- Yeah.

33:59.985 --> 34:03.728
It's just where we talked
about me going.

34:06.491 --> 34:08.061
It's kind of weird, right?

34:08.226 --> 34:11.902
It's always been
where I wanted to go.

34:12.063 --> 34:14.237
Where I was supposed to go.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.243
I don't think
I ever even questioned it.

34:21.607 --> 34:23.143
Yeah.

34:25.978 --> 34:27.355
They're not gonna give up.

34:28.213 --> 34:31.092
No, they'll come. For you.

34:37.356 --> 34:39.029
Thanks, guys.

34:40.492 --> 34:42.972
Prepare to board in five minutes.

34:45.731 --> 34:47.233
I'm sorry.

34:53.371 --> 34:54.442
<i>Did you find her?</i>

34:55.808 --> 34:57.549
Not yet, but we will.

34:57.709 --> 35:00.918
Yeah, we're gonna
go back out tomorrow.

35:01.613 --> 35:04.958
Sweetie, your mom and I are gonna
need to stay a few more days.

35:05.117 --> 35:06.221
Is that okay?

35:06.385 --> 35:09.127
<i>Sure. Stay however long you need.</i>

36:10.415 --> 36:13.658
There we go.
That should hold for a bit.

36:15.120 --> 36:16.565
Seriously?

36:31.370 --> 36:33.213
Okay, now it's good.

36:35.841 --> 36:37.149
Celebration swim?

36:39.211 --> 36:40.656
Come on.

36:41.713 --> 36:44.853
Come on, it's like a million degrees.
We earned it.

37:12.511 --> 37:14.855
I cannot eat any more fruit!

38:05.397 --> 38:08.344
- Hey, prom queen!
- Don't look.

38:08.500 --> 38:11.447
I was just gonna ask
if you had any more sunscreen left.

38:11.603 --> 38:14.277
I don't have any more anything left.
Look yourself.

38:14.439 --> 38:16.817
The bottles are in the baggies
in the hut.

38:16.975 --> 38:21.014
- I looked for them, didn't see any.
- They're there, but they're empty.

38:21.179 --> 38:25.389
I'm sure there's aloe somewhere.
Now turn around and stop looking.

38:25.851 --> 38:30.027
You know that every time you say that,
it reminds me I should be looking?

38:30.589 --> 38:31.795
I'm serious.

38:32.624 --> 38:34.865
You're the one
who asked me to stand guard.

38:35.027 --> 38:38.236
There's something out there.
I can hear it at night.

38:39.865 --> 38:42.004
<i>This afternoon,
according to officials...</i>

38:42.167 --> 38:44.477
<i>the investigation
has been downgraded...</i>

38:44.636 --> 38:48.311
<i>...from a search-and-rescue
to a search-and-recovery effort...</i>

38:48.473 --> 38:50.919
<i>...as hope of finding the pair alive
has faded.</i>

38:51.076 --> 38:52.851
I want you to call me every day.

38:53.011 --> 38:56.424
- Sometimes twice a day if you can.
- I will, I promise.

38:56.581 --> 38:59.289
I just hate the idea
of leaving you alone down here.

38:59.451 --> 39:01.328
I'll be fine. You've gotta go back.

39:01.486 --> 39:04.092
Stacey needs one of us there,
especially now.

39:04.256 --> 39:06.566
No, I know. You're right.

39:07.793 --> 39:11.935
Well, it's official.
They called off the rescue search.

39:12.731 --> 39:15.234
See what this is?
They don't have the resources.

39:15.400 --> 39:16.435
That's what it is.

39:16.601 --> 39:19.104
<i>--For the families
and the students back home...</i>

39:19.271 --> 39:20.807
<i>...who have kept constant...</i>

39:20.972 --> 39:23.009
I'm not gonna stop, Phil.

39:23.875 --> 39:26.981
I promise, I'll bring her back home.

39:28.146 --> 39:30.126
I know you will.

39:31.349 --> 39:32.828
I know you will.

39:39.324 --> 39:41.930
Jack, thank you for hiring this.

39:42.093 --> 39:44.869
We'll keep covering these waters.

39:45.230 --> 39:48.507
We still have two hours
of flying time.

40:01.413 --> 40:03.689
I miss my mom and dad.

40:04.249 --> 40:06.889
I even miss my little sister.

40:08.453 --> 40:10.330
And my fish.

40:11.556 --> 40:14.867
The smell of my sheets
when they first get out of the dryer.

40:18.463 --> 40:20.875
I'll bet they're still looking for us.

40:21.566 --> 40:23.477
They'd have to be, right?

40:24.202 --> 40:26.478
- You think they quit?
- Would you?

40:28.106 --> 40:32.020
I mean, you keep looking
for something, at some point...

40:32.177 --> 40:33.986
...you figure it's gone, right?

40:40.418 --> 40:43.831
Why do you do this?
Watch the sunset every day?

40:44.656 --> 40:47.796
- Looking for something.
- What?

40:51.897 --> 40:55.276
Nothing. It's stupid.

40:57.602 --> 40:59.445
Zippo's dead.

41:06.544 --> 41:08.217
What is it?

41:16.588 --> 41:18.761
Oh, my God.

41:20.025 --> 41:21.834
How long do you think
he was there?

41:23.094 --> 41:26.803
How long do you think he pretended
that he was gonna make it home?

41:30.669 --> 41:32.444
This guy is not us, Em.

41:32.604 --> 41:34.675
He could've been
some local fisherman...

41:34.839 --> 41:37.012
...or drug smuggler or anyone.

41:38.076 --> 41:40.215
You've got people out there
who love you.

41:40.378 --> 41:41.789
People looking for you.

41:44.116 --> 41:46.892
And you know what else?
We got each other.

41:47.052 --> 41:49.396
And that's something right there,
prom queen.

41:49.554 --> 41:52.831
We're gonna be okay. You hear me?

41:52.991 --> 41:54.800
Nothing bad's gonna happen to you.

43:13.638 --> 43:15.584
Why are you crying?

43:16.841 --> 43:18.514
That was...

43:19.811 --> 43:22.223
That felt so good.

43:24.349 --> 43:26.295
You make that sound
like a bad thing.

43:28.553 --> 43:30.362
It's just...

43:30.522 --> 43:33.298
...for a while, I forgot where we were.

43:34.893 --> 43:37.134
I pictured us home...

43:38.029 --> 43:41.169
worrying about what everybody
was gonna say.

43:43.268 --> 43:45.339
I felt so normal.

44:12.797 --> 44:15.334
Hey, where's my latte?

44:18.036 --> 44:20.277
I'm going to the lagoon.

44:20.839 --> 44:23.285
Dean, did you take
the big water bottle?

44:25.076 --> 44:26.885
Dean?

44:28.713 --> 44:30.283
Dean?

44:31.182 --> 44:32.661
Dean?

44:34.152 --> 44:35.722
Dean?

44:39.724 --> 44:41.704
- Why would you do that?
- Do what?

44:41.860 --> 44:44.568
Leave me there without saying
where you were going--

44:44.729 --> 44:47.903
- You were sleeping.
- And I woke up and you were nowhere.

44:48.066 --> 44:51.206
- What are you doing?
- He deserves to be buried.

44:51.369 --> 44:53.212
Okay? At least have a funeral.

44:56.708 --> 44:59.416
Dean, I don't understand. What--?

44:59.577 --> 45:02.558
- Talk to me. I'm here and--
- You're here and what?

45:02.714 --> 45:04.955
We had sex once.
We're stuck on an island.

45:05.116 --> 45:06.891
We're not soul mates.

45:08.753 --> 45:10.323
That's mean.

45:10.488 --> 45:13.492
Yeah, I'm not a nice guy, Emma.
And now you know.

45:16.227 --> 45:17.706
I don't believe that.

45:17.862 --> 45:20.866
Whatever it is, I'll listen.
Please, just give me--

45:23.368 --> 45:24.938
Emma!

45:26.137 --> 45:28.139
I'm so sorry, Em. I didn't mean to...

45:28.306 --> 45:30.547
It was an accident. I fell.

45:30.708 --> 45:33.746
I don't know what I'd do
if something happened to you.

45:37.382 --> 45:38.417
What are we doing?

45:39.717 --> 45:43.187
We're not some happy couple
on an island vacation.

45:43.788 --> 45:47.201
How are we gonna make it
day after day, just the two of us?

45:47.358 --> 45:50.669
What if something goes wrong?
I mean, what if I broke my leg...

45:50.829 --> 45:54.902
...or one of us gets sick
or something like that?

45:55.733 --> 45:57.940
Nobody knows what's out there, Em.

45:58.103 --> 46:01.141
There's stuff that
we don't know how to deal with...

46:01.306 --> 46:03.343
...and we just gotta figure it out.

46:14.119 --> 46:15.826
I didn't go to my mom's funeral.

46:16.588 --> 46:20.934
That's why I wanted to bury that guy.
Just flesh.

46:21.092 --> 46:23.402
Ashes to ashes.

46:23.762 --> 46:26.971
I thought maybe seeing him
dead in the ground and all that...

46:27.132 --> 46:29.612
...would make things make sense.

46:29.767 --> 46:30.905
Did it?

46:31.603 --> 46:33.310
Not really.

46:34.906 --> 46:37.011
I guess that's the point.

46:37.375 --> 46:39.184
It doesn't always makes sense.

46:45.817 --> 46:47.626
We need hydrotherapy.

46:50.388 --> 46:52.026
And you kind of stink, so...

47:13.778 --> 47:18.124
Step into my office and tell me
about your problems, Mr. McMullen.

47:24.989 --> 47:27.094
I couldn't handle seeing...

47:27.258 --> 47:30.000
Seeing all of it.

47:32.630 --> 47:36.373
You know, the casket
and all the people pitying me.

47:36.868 --> 47:37.972
Blaming me or--

47:38.136 --> 47:40.207
Why would they blame you?

47:43.041 --> 47:44.213
Because I killed her.

47:52.317 --> 47:55.093
She was driving me home
from soccer practice.

47:55.787 --> 48:00.361
We were driving down this side road,
and it was dark.

48:05.730 --> 48:08.233
We used to play this game
when it was snowing...

48:08.399 --> 48:11.312
...where she'd flick on the high beams,
on and off.

48:12.537 --> 48:14.983
It'd look like we were going
into hyperspace...

48:15.139 --> 48:17.949
...from a Star Wars movie
or something like that.

48:18.443 --> 48:21.947
I reached over, trying to be funny,
trying to be like her.

48:23.982 --> 48:26.155
Lost control of the car.

48:26.851 --> 48:29.127
We were laughing,
and the next thing...

48:33.324 --> 48:36.134
I was in the hospital for three days.

48:36.928 --> 48:39.272
When I got out, she was gone.

48:40.231 --> 48:42.472
You didn't kill her.

48:48.740 --> 48:49.912
No.

48:52.377 --> 48:54.823
We should maybe think
about moving here.

48:54.979 --> 48:58.517
Nice neighborhood, and I hear
the public schools are great.

50:42.387 --> 50:47.132
A month after two students went
missing off the coast of Trinidad...

50:47.292 --> 50:50.239
...the search for Emmaline Robinson
and Dean McMullen...

50:50.394 --> 50:51.600
...has been called off.

50:51.763 --> 50:55.267
It's believed that the students
have been lost at sea.

50:55.433 --> 50:58.107
I can't believe
they're gonna stop looking for her.

50:58.269 --> 51:00.545
Even if it's just for her body
or something.

51:00.705 --> 51:03.208
Wow, Helen, that's kind of morbid.

51:03.374 --> 51:06.048
Well, her mom's still there.
Maybe she'll find her.

51:07.178 --> 51:08.782
I know we've been over this...

51:08.946 --> 51:11.358
...but if you'd look
at the new information...

51:11.516 --> 51:15.828
...regarding weather patterns, you'd see
we've been looking in the wrong place.

51:15.987 --> 51:19.366
Mrs. Robinson,
I've seen this information.

51:19.524 --> 51:23.233
- Perhaps your embassy can--
- I've been to the embassy twice.

51:43.648 --> 51:46.128
Excuse me,
have you seen these two?

51:59.730 --> 52:03.337
Sony, folks,
no planes taking off today.

52:09.840 --> 52:12.514
They say the storm
could last for days.

52:12.677 --> 52:14.350
Yep.

52:21.085 --> 52:23.156
When my wife died...

52:24.388 --> 52:27.426
...l tried so hard to keep her here,
you know...

52:27.592 --> 52:29.503
...keep her alive.

52:30.928 --> 52:33.499
I almost lost everything I had.

52:36.200 --> 52:37.770
Dean and I barely spoke.

52:37.935 --> 52:40.939
I almost lost my partnership
at the firm.

52:45.376 --> 52:48.983
I was so focused on what I'd lost,
I forgot what I had.

52:53.417 --> 52:55.954
Maybe it's time to go home, Barbara.

52:58.456 --> 53:00.800
It's not like we haven't tried.

53:00.958 --> 53:02.767
It's a tough call.

53:44.001 --> 53:46.208
Whenever we were at the beach...

53:46.370 --> 53:48.714
...my mom used to talk
about the green flash.

53:48.873 --> 53:52.013
My dad and I would watch
and watch.

53:52.510 --> 53:53.545
I've never seen it.

53:55.546 --> 53:58.425
It's supposed to be
right on the horizon line...

53:58.583 --> 54:00.722
...just as the sun comes down.

54:02.487 --> 54:04.728
I'm thinking maybe it's just a thing...

54:05.923 --> 54:09.803
...people believe in to make them feel
like there's something out there...

54:09.961 --> 54:13.807
...you know? Beauty or whatever.

54:16.434 --> 54:19.210
How long do you really think
we can survive here?

54:27.011 --> 54:29.924
We're gonna be fine, okay?

56:13.484 --> 56:15.828
Should we feel guilty?

56:16.520 --> 56:18.022
For what?

56:19.957 --> 56:22.528
Not being sad all the time.

56:23.060 --> 56:25.267
They probably think we're dead.

56:26.230 --> 56:28.176
But we're not dead.

56:28.332 --> 56:30.573
So we gotta live a little, right?

56:31.368 --> 56:34.281
I just feel like
we should be doing something...

56:34.438 --> 56:37.112
...like trying to find a way off or...

56:37.274 --> 56:38.912
We tried.

56:39.510 --> 56:41.456
We'll keep trying.

56:45.683 --> 56:47.629
Have you been shaving?

56:47.785 --> 56:48.957
What?

56:49.119 --> 56:52.157
You have, like, almost no beard.

56:54.091 --> 56:58.597
Okay, first of all, bite me.

56:59.864 --> 57:03.004
And second of all, it'll get heavier...

57:03.167 --> 57:04.703
...l hope.

57:11.676 --> 57:12.984
Was that okay?

57:14.378 --> 57:15.413
I mean...

57:16.313 --> 57:18.315
...was I okay?

57:19.550 --> 57:22.895
Emma, you are so much better
than okay.

57:23.821 --> 57:25.300
Okay?

57:25.456 --> 57:30.337
If okay is around here somewhere,
you are way over the damn palm trees.

57:30.761 --> 57:34.470
If okay is like a little tiny grain of sand,
you're the whole beach.

57:35.065 --> 57:37.443
If okay is like a little drop of water...

57:37.601 --> 57:40.445
...you're like
the whole freaking Caribbean.

57:40.604 --> 57:42.481
Need me to go on?

57:42.940 --> 57:44.578
Okay.

57:48.012 --> 57:50.185
You were never like this at school.

57:50.848 --> 57:52.384
Like what?

57:52.549 --> 57:55.462
I don't know, fun.

57:57.421 --> 58:00.891
- You're different too.
- No, I'm not.

58:01.058 --> 58:03.800
Yeah, you kind of are.

58:04.495 --> 58:06.065
How so?

58:07.531 --> 58:09.943
No posse, no books.

58:10.868 --> 58:13.348
I used to watch you sometimes.

58:13.838 --> 58:15.749
That's not creepy.

58:17.174 --> 58:19.882
You always seemed like
you had a plan.

58:20.044 --> 58:24.015
Like you had something to do
or somewhere to go.

58:26.116 --> 58:28.790
I guess now
you got nowhere to go, huh?

58:31.822 --> 58:34.564
I can't believe I'm saying this...

58:35.659 --> 58:38.333
...but I kind of like where I am.

58:40.164 --> 58:44.237
And for the record,
I watched you sometimes too.

58:49.473 --> 58:51.612
Who was your first time?

58:52.810 --> 58:56.986
- Oh, we're playing that game?
- Yeah, we are. Who?

58:58.148 --> 59:01.095
I was a sophomore
and she was a junior.

59:01.518 --> 59:04.761
- Do I know her?
- No, she was in college.

59:05.489 --> 59:07.093
I don't know.

59:07.257 --> 59:09.362
I thought she could teach me
some stuff.

59:10.694 --> 59:12.367
Was it fun?

59:12.830 --> 59:15.401
All five minutes were a blast.

59:21.906 --> 59:24.182
Okay, who was your first?

59:30.514 --> 59:34.860
No, no, no.

59:35.018 --> 59:38.488
I told you mine,
now you have to tell me yours.

59:39.723 --> 59:42.863
Football player? Band geek?

59:43.027 --> 59:44.404
- Teacher?
- You.

59:44.562 --> 59:45.597
What?

59:46.563 --> 59:49.669
- You.
- Me?

59:50.668 --> 59:52.341
I was your...?

59:54.638 --> 59:57.642
- Is that a bad "wow"?
- No.

59:58.308 --> 01:00:00.185
Just a "WOW H

01:00:07.451 --> 01:00:09.260
Was it okay?

01:00:10.187 --> 01:00:13.031
I got sand in some weird places.

01:00:19.096 --> 01:00:21.076
I'm glad it was me.

01:00:21.999 --> 01:00:23.603
Me too.

01:00:24.935 --> 01:00:28.712
So since this is all pretty new
to me...

01:00:28.872 --> 01:00:30.749
...maybe we should practice more.

01:00:30.908 --> 01:00:32.387
Yeah.

01:01:19.423 --> 01:01:21.801
Emma, did you hear that?

01:01:21.959 --> 01:01:25.566
Plane! Get the flare gun.
I'll catch up with you.

01:01:41.945 --> 01:01:43.049
No, no, no.

01:01:43.213 --> 01:01:49.425
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:01:53.757 --> 01:01:55.930
They were too high.

01:01:56.093 --> 01:02:00.064
- Did you fire both flares? I didn't see.
- No, I couldn't find the gun.

01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:03.541
What do you mean?
It's in the same place it's always been.

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:06.180
This is our chance, Dean.

01:02:07.704 --> 01:02:09.706
I don't understand.
Where could it be?

01:02:09.873 --> 01:02:11.853
- Did you move it?
- No.

01:02:12.009 --> 01:02:14.011
You're the only one
who's picked it up.

01:02:14.178 --> 01:02:15.623
So you're saying I lost it?

01:02:15.779 --> 01:02:19.192
I'm not saying anybody lost it,
I'm just saying it's not there.

01:02:19.883 --> 01:02:22.363
Someone's been taking our stuff.

01:02:22.519 --> 01:02:26.092
The baggies and my lotions
and my sunscreen and toothpaste.

01:02:26.256 --> 01:02:29.760
- That stuff ran out a long time ago.
- Yeah, but I kept the bottles.

01:02:29.927 --> 01:02:32.533
I use them for aloe
and for water and...

01:02:32.696 --> 01:02:35.734
- Where's the water bottle?
- It's probably there somewhere.

01:02:35.899 --> 01:02:39.847
- I bet you were organizing things--
- Oh, really, organizing?

01:02:40.003 --> 01:02:43.075
That's what happened,
I organized too much.

01:02:47.611 --> 01:02:48.783
Hang on.

01:02:51.949 --> 01:02:54.793
- Emma. Emma.
- Get off me.

01:02:59.556 --> 01:03:01.900
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

01:03:02.059 --> 01:03:07.702
I can't. I can't do this.
I cannot stay on this island any more.

01:03:07.865 --> 01:03:10.402
What are you gonna do, swim back?

01:03:13.971 --> 01:03:15.143
Emma.

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:33.265
Hello!

01:03:35.025 --> 01:03:37.335
There's no one out there, is there?

01:03:38.695 --> 01:03:42.268
Hello!

01:04:19.636 --> 01:04:21.912
We've seen one plane
since we've been here.

01:04:22.072 --> 01:04:24.746
I'm never gonna see
my family again.

01:04:32.416 --> 01:04:36.125
We'll be better off in there,
long-term.

01:04:36.286 --> 01:04:38.698
What's long-term, Dean?

01:04:39.256 --> 01:04:43.136
Look, Em, at some point,
we're gonna have to say this is it.

01:04:43.293 --> 01:04:46.763
This is our life, you know?
It's you and me.

01:04:49.967 --> 01:04:51.605
You hear that?

01:04:51.768 --> 01:04:54.009
It's nothing. It's just the wind.

01:04:54.171 --> 01:04:56.845
I'm gonna find whatever it is
and make it stop.

01:04:57.007 --> 01:04:58.714
Dean, no.

01:05:26.503 --> 01:05:27.538
Dean?

01:05:52.462 --> 01:05:53.839
Dean!

01:06:04.908 --> 01:06:06.387
Dean!

01:06:22.592 --> 01:06:24.196
Dean!

01:09:53.903 --> 01:09:56.975
- You see that? You saw it. You saw it.
- I saw it. I saw it.

01:09:57.140 --> 01:10:00.781
You saw it. We saw it.
Oh, my God, we saw it.

01:10:11.922 --> 01:10:15.870
Think it was the fish?
It smelled a little weird.

01:10:23.867 --> 01:10:26.211
You think maybe you're pregnant?

01:10:26.636 --> 01:10:28.616
No, I'm not.

01:10:29.473 --> 01:10:32.454
It's not that I don't want kids,
it's just...

01:10:32.609 --> 01:10:35.089
- You know.
- I know.

01:10:35.245 --> 01:10:36.553
Yeah.

01:10:37.447 --> 01:10:38.687
You want kids?

01:10:39.516 --> 01:10:41.052
Someday.

01:10:43.153 --> 01:10:44.257
Me too.

01:10:55.332 --> 01:10:58.472
I'd give anything
for some toothpaste right now.

01:10:59.403 --> 01:11:02.282
And some chicken soup
and a sad movie.

01:11:02.439 --> 01:11:06.319
Come here, lie down.
I'll make you feel better.

01:11:16.152 --> 01:11:19.224
Do you ever think about
what everybody else is doing?

01:11:21.324 --> 01:11:23.463
Who's everybody else?

01:11:23.993 --> 01:11:26.166
Friends, family...

01:11:26.329 --> 01:11:28.366
...people out in the world.

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:33.242
We're everybody else now,
prom queen.

01:11:37.808 --> 01:11:39.583
- What was that?
- What the--?

01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:53.099
Okay there, buddy. Stop, stop.
Okay, put it down.

01:11:53.256 --> 01:11:55.759
Put the gun down
and step away from the vehicle.

01:11:55.926 --> 01:11:57.530
Come on, monkey, drop the gun.

01:11:59.095 --> 01:12:02.042
No, no, no. Stop, stop, stop.
Put it down!

01:12:02.199 --> 01:12:06.375
Come on, little guy.
I'll trade you, banana for the gun.

01:12:09.038 --> 01:12:11.450
He didn't even take his banana.

01:12:14.277 --> 01:12:16.223
You know what?

01:12:17.547 --> 01:12:19.618
What the hell?
What'd you do that for?

01:12:19.783 --> 01:12:22.992
- I don't wanna hope any more.
- You're acting crazy. Why did--?

01:12:23.153 --> 01:12:26.396
I'm crazy? No, see,
crazy is thinking that we can survive...

01:12:26.556 --> 01:12:28.627
...for more than a year on this island.

01:12:28.792 --> 01:12:30.271
That's crazy.

01:12:30.427 --> 01:12:33.897
We're gonna make a life here, Em.
It's gonna be better, I promise.

01:12:34.064 --> 01:12:36.670
No noise. I mean,
what's so good out there anyway?

01:12:36.833 --> 01:12:40.042
Life, Dean.
Life is what's so good out there.

01:12:40.203 --> 01:12:43.707
Our families, our-- Everything.

01:12:46.643 --> 01:12:48.247
You're crazy if you think...

01:12:48.411 --> 01:12:51.017
...that I would actually choose
to live like this.

01:12:51.181 --> 01:12:53.923
This is not living, this is surviving.

01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:15.181
Any luck?

01:13:15.338 --> 01:13:16.840
No.

01:13:20.043 --> 01:13:21.317
I never said thank you.

01:13:22.545 --> 01:13:25.958
- For what?
- For saving me.

01:13:27.450 --> 01:13:30.090
For being there. Here.

01:13:30.587 --> 01:13:32.089
Emma...

01:13:42.766 --> 01:13:44.905
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:13:45.068 --> 01:13:47.446
- Hey!
- Where is it?

01:13:47.604 --> 01:13:49.777
Here, hold this.

01:13:49.939 --> 01:13:51.009
Load and shoot, Em.

01:13:52.675 --> 01:13:55.019
Pull the trigger, prom queen.

01:13:59.216 --> 01:14:00.786
- Over here!
- Hey!

01:14:05.054 --> 01:14:10.504
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Hey! Hey! We're here!

01:14:21.605 --> 01:14:24.211
Family and friends
eagerly await the appearance...

01:14:24.374 --> 01:14:27.412
...of two students lost at sea
for more than three months.

01:14:27.577 --> 01:14:29.557
Emmaline Robinson
and Dean McMullen...

01:14:29.713 --> 01:14:32.216
...were rescued
by a helicopter pilot...

01:14:32.382 --> 01:14:35.556
...on a sightseeing tour
just off the coast of Venezuela.

01:14:35.719 --> 01:14:37.995
- Hey, get down.
- I don't think so.

01:14:38.154 --> 01:14:40.828
- There's Emma.
- Emma!

01:14:40.990 --> 01:14:42.833
Hey, Emma!

01:14:46.396 --> 01:14:49.570
- Over here!
- Emma!

01:14:53.970 --> 01:14:55.472
Hey, Emma!

01:15:58.067 --> 01:15:59.603
Emma!

01:16:04.941 --> 01:16:07.615
I never thought I'd see you again.

01:16:18.421 --> 01:16:19.957
<i>- Hey.-
- Hey.-</i>

01:16:20.123 --> 01:16:21.796
What are you doing here?

01:16:21.958 --> 01:16:24.996
I wanted to check on you,
first night back and all.

01:16:25.161 --> 01:16:28.472
I was just looking at Facebook
and stuff.

01:16:30.033 --> 01:16:33.480
- Weird being back, huh?
- Yeah.

01:16:35.071 --> 01:16:38.109
They said we don't have to
go back to school right away.

01:16:38.274 --> 01:16:39.810
Yeah, I know.

01:16:45.281 --> 01:16:48.160
- Of course you are.
- What does that mean?

01:16:49.152 --> 01:16:51.154
Nothing, just...

01:16:51.688 --> 01:16:53.827
I guess summer's over, huh?

01:16:54.691 --> 01:16:56.466
You're talking in code.

01:16:59.229 --> 01:17:01.732
My dad told me about your party.

01:17:01.898 --> 01:17:05.539
Mom's throwing it,
a homecoming thing.

01:17:05.702 --> 01:17:08.774
Are you gonna come?
Lots of kids from school will be there.

01:17:08.938 --> 01:17:11.976
- It'll be fun.
- Yeah, fun.

01:17:14.677 --> 01:17:17.556
You should probably go.

01:17:17.714 --> 01:17:21.685
My mom and dad have been checking
on me like every 10 minutes.

01:17:21.851 --> 01:17:23.524
Sure.

01:17:23.686 --> 01:17:25.859
Come to the party, okay?

01:17:40.770 --> 01:17:43.046
First of all,
thank you so much for coming.

01:17:43.206 --> 01:17:45.447
It's a special day for us.

01:17:45.608 --> 01:17:49.715
I can't imagine the courage it took
to survive those days.

01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:53.827
I really can't.
But I'm so grateful that you did.

01:17:53.983 --> 01:17:56.463
To my girl and to Dean.

01:17:56.619 --> 01:17:59.429
- Where is Dean?
- Behind you.

01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:02.126
I cannot thank you enough.

01:18:02.291 --> 01:18:04.794
You kids really are
an inspiration to us all.

01:18:04.961 --> 01:18:07.271
I mean that. To Emma and to Dean.

01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:11.037
- To Emma and to Dean.
- Hear, hear.

01:18:11.201 --> 01:18:12.771
Yeah.

01:18:16.839 --> 01:18:20.048
- Thank you for coming.
- Thanks so much for having us.

01:18:20.209 --> 01:18:22.951
How come you're not over there
with everybody else?

01:18:23.112 --> 01:18:26.093
I'm not really an everybody-else
kind of guy.

01:18:26.849 --> 01:18:30.160
Emma is. Always has been.

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:33.324
She's really good at that.
People really like her.

01:18:33.489 --> 01:18:34.991
Yeah, I can see that.

01:18:35.158 --> 01:18:37.035
Did you see any sharks?

01:18:37.227 --> 01:18:40.538
It took her like two seconds
to become even more popular...

01:18:40.696 --> 01:18:44.508
-...than before you guys went away.
- Yeah, I can see that too.

01:18:52.342 --> 01:18:54.618
- Come <i>on.</i>
- Like the memoirs. You know what?

01:18:54.777 --> 01:18:58.452
<i>I can't come. Sorry.</i>

01:19:07.323 --> 01:19:09.860
<i>They're calling it
"the miracle at sea. "</i>

01:19:10.026 --> 01:19:12.700
After more than 100 days
on a desert island...

01:19:12.862 --> 01:19:15.365
...two high school juniors,
Emmaline Robinson...

01:19:15.531 --> 01:19:18.740
...and Dean McMullen,
have safely returned to their school...

01:19:18.902 --> 01:19:21.781
...to their family, to their friends,
to their lives...

01:19:21.938 --> 01:19:25.215
...that they thought
they might never see again.

01:19:27.443 --> 01:19:29.320
Welcome back.

01:19:29.946 --> 01:19:32.051
Excuse us.

01:20:05.248 --> 01:20:07.250
I told him I'd think about it.

01:20:07.416 --> 01:20:11.387
Oh, my God, Em, you're my hero.
You told Stephen...?

01:20:12.255 --> 01:20:13.495
You are so the bomb.

01:20:23.232 --> 01:20:24.802
Anyway, so I'm gonna wear...

01:20:24.967 --> 01:20:27.038
Hey, McMullen.

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:32.583
Come on.

01:21:27.063 --> 01:21:29.339
Mom wanted me to tell you
it was dinnertime.

01:21:29.499 --> 01:21:31.809
- Okay.
- And I was gonna feed the fish.

01:21:31.968 --> 01:21:35.211
- Yeah, go ahead. You can feed them.
- Okay.

01:21:35.838 --> 01:21:37.840
What's with the dresses?

01:21:38.007 --> 01:21:39.987
I don't know.

01:21:40.142 --> 01:21:42.486
It's all feeling like...

01:21:42.645 --> 01:21:44.682
It's all feeling like someone else.

01:21:44.847 --> 01:21:48.989
You know, when you were gone,
Mom knew I was there for once.

01:21:49.152 --> 01:21:52.463
I didn't have to yell
or get in trouble or anything.

01:21:53.022 --> 01:21:57.630
At school,
all the teachers were nice to me.

01:21:58.795 --> 01:22:02.106
Even if it was just for pity,
I didn't care.

01:22:03.432 --> 01:22:07.380
And now you're the girl
who survived on the island...

01:22:08.204 --> 01:22:12.152
...going to prom with
the F'ing quarterback, for crap's sake.

01:22:13.009 --> 01:22:18.789
And I'm back to just being me.

01:22:21.617 --> 01:22:25.463
Stacey, you're amazing...

01:22:25.888 --> 01:22:28.732
...and cool and funny...

01:22:28.891 --> 01:22:32.964
...and all of these things
that I can never be.

01:22:34.497 --> 01:22:38.775
And just so you know,
I'm not going to prom with Stephen.

01:22:39.602 --> 01:22:42.674
Really?
Well, who are you gonna go with?

01:22:43.639 --> 01:22:45.346
Nobody.

01:22:46.242 --> 01:22:47.516
You wanna be my date?

01:22:50.313 --> 01:22:53.260
- I missed you, Emma.
- I missed you too.

01:22:53.416 --> 01:22:55.726
I missed you so much.

01:23:11.667 --> 01:23:13.647
I saw it, Mom.

01:23:14.237 --> 01:23:16.649
I saw the green flash.

01:23:18.708 --> 01:23:20.710
It was beautiful.

01:23:22.411 --> 01:23:23.947
And...

01:23:29.785 --> 01:23:33.631
And I just wanted to say I'm sorry
for not being there at your funeral.

01:23:53.742 --> 01:23:56.052
And thanks for watching over us.

01:24:09.759 --> 01:24:12.569
- What do you think?
- It's amazing.

01:24:13.129 --> 01:24:16.667
There's a cute hipster boy
looking right at you, sis.

01:24:16.832 --> 01:24:19.005
- He's looking at you, Em.
- Don't think so.

01:24:19.168 --> 01:24:20.875
Go.

01:24:33.015 --> 01:24:34.494
<i>In front.</i>

01:24:34.650 --> 01:24:38.325
<i>Three down. Oh, what a save.</i>

01:24:38.487 --> 01:24:40.057
<i>Cleared but not out.</i>

01:24:40.222 --> 01:24:42.532
<i>Another shot blocked.</i>

01:24:45.261 --> 01:24:48.105
- You staying in tonight?
- Yeah.

01:24:48.264 --> 01:24:51.143
<i>--The goalie and clears the center
down the ice.</i>

01:24:52.067 --> 01:24:53.944
<i>We're just hanging on now, with...</i>

01:24:54.103 --> 01:24:56.379
You wanna borrow my tux?

01:25:08.617 --> 01:25:10.893
Emma, you look amazing.

01:25:12.588 --> 01:25:15.592
Stephen's gotta be going crazy.

01:25:19.862 --> 01:25:21.864
He's kind of gross anyway...

01:25:22.031 --> 01:25:24.739
...in a smoking-hot kind of way.

01:25:25.401 --> 01:25:27.142
Come on, walk with me.

01:25:27.303 --> 01:25:30.307
You know,
I knew this was always in you.

01:25:30.473 --> 01:25:34.888
It just took being stuck in the middle
of the ocean to find it, but...

01:25:35.811 --> 01:25:38.417
Let's get you a broody boy.

01:25:40.683 --> 01:25:43.630
Oh, my dog

01:25:46.055 --> 01:25:48.592
Damn, he looks good.

01:25:51.594 --> 01:25:54.734
Go. Be romantic.

01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:20.758
I've been trying to come up
with the perfect thing to say.

01:26:20.923 --> 01:26:24.166
I mean, I...
I didn't even know if I could get in.

01:26:24.727 --> 01:26:26.934
Plans are overrated.

01:26:34.336 --> 01:26:36.145
I got you something.

01:26:39.975 --> 01:26:42.581
- Thank you.
- Wanna dance, prom queen?

01:26:42.745 --> 01:26:45.954
I'm not the prom queen. I never was.

01:26:46.115 --> 01:26:48.595
Never wanted to be. I...

01:26:49.452 --> 01:26:51.591
I'm just a girl.

01:26:52.888 --> 01:26:53.923
Wanna dance, girl?

01:26:55.057 --> 01:26:57.503
It's kind of pouring.

01:26:57.660 --> 01:27:01.107
- We've been through worse.
- Yeah.
