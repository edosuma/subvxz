WEBVTT

03:31.962 --> 03:33.327
<i>How's this, boss?</i>

03:33.797 --> 03:34.957
Great.

03:35.532 --> 03:37.557
You don't think it should
go below the plaque?

03:40.971 --> 03:42.734
<i>Oh, here, precious.</i>

03:44.408 --> 03:45.898
You got it crooked.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.443
<i>Gee, boss. This is the big
break we've been waiting for.</i>

03:51.515 --> 03:53.039
<i>With all this press
and Maxfield behind you,</i>

03:53.116 --> 03:55.744
<i>why, you're going to have more
clients than you know what to do with.</i>

03:55.819 --> 03:58.151
I would have loved to have seen
the look on Inspector Wolf's face

03:58.221 --> 03:59.848
when they handed him
the paper this morning.

03:59.923 --> 04:01.481
I bet he choked on his coffee.

04:01.592 --> 04:03.890
We'll probably need a bigger
office in a nicer neighborhood.

04:03.961 --> 04:06.759
It's not the first time I've snatched a
case right out from underneath his nose.

04:07.931 --> 04:09.489
<i>I'll get it. Probably
won't be the last, either.</i>

04:10.834 --> 04:14.099
<i>Still, it's Wolf's town. He's not
going to let you make a fool of him</i>

04:14.171 --> 04:16.332
without trying to find
a way to get back.

04:19.543 --> 04:22.034
<i>Thomas Magnum,
Private Investigator.</i>

04:22.512 --> 04:23.979
Yes.

04:24.348 --> 04:26.248
Yes. Who?

04:28.318 --> 04:30.183
<i>Just a minute, please.</i>

04:31.021 --> 04:34.479
It's Alicia Maxfield. She
says she has to talk to you.

04:34.825 --> 04:37.453
Yeah? What could this be?

04:41.098 --> 04:42.690
Hello? This
is Magnum.

04:42.799 --> 04:44.494
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

04:49.906 --> 04:52.033
No kidding.
Who else knows?

04:52.743 --> 04:56.474
<i>That's good. No, you're doing
fine so far. I'll be right there.</i>

04:57.914 --> 04:59.745
William Tyler Maxfield's
been murdered.

04:59.816 --> 05:01.147
No!

05:01.251 --> 05:03.310
The cops aren't in on it yet.

05:03.987 --> 05:07.514
<i>Listen, you'd better stick
by the phone. I may need you.</i>

05:08.058 --> 05:09.855
Thomas.

05:12.029 --> 05:13.326
Be careful.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.767
<i>William Tyler Maxfield.</i>

05:20.837 --> 05:24.500
<i>There wasn't a newsboy or office girl
in America who didn't know that name</i>

05:24.574 --> 05:26.974
<i>and the papers he put out
under the Maxfield banner.</i>

05:27.044 --> 05:30.445
<i>The Daily Sentinel in New
York. The Evening Star in LA.</i>

05:30.514 --> 05:32.106
<i>The Gazette in San Francisco.</i>

05:32.182 --> 05:35.549
<i>And probably a dozen more
between St. Louis and Denver.</i>

05:35.619 --> 05:38.110
<i>He'd made a lot of enemies
in his climb to the top.</i>

05:38.188 --> 05:41.055
<i>Finding someone with a motive
for murder would be easy.</i>

05:41.124 --> 05:44.753
<i>Narrowing it down to one
suspect was something else again.</i>

05:44.861 --> 05:47.159
<i>Mr. Magnum,
please come in.</i>

05:49.800 --> 05:52.030
I'm afraid there's been a
rather unfortunate accident.

05:52.102 --> 05:53.865
<i>Yeah, I know. Mrs. Maxfield called me.</i>

05:53.937 --> 05:56.872
Looks like the police
beat me here after all.

06:05.348 --> 06:08.010
<i>Well, well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.</i>

06:08.085 --> 06:09.416
Inspector.

06:10.053 --> 06:12.578
<i>Yeah, I should have
known you'd show up.</i>

06:12.656 --> 06:15.921
You're just naturally attracted to
trouble like rotting meat attracts flies.

06:15.992 --> 06:17.482
That's very descriptive.

06:17.561 --> 06:19.961
Too bad you're not as good an
investigator as you are a talker.

06:20.030 --> 06:23.488
But then I guess having unsolved murder
cases lying around doesn't bother you.

06:23.567 --> 06:27.128
<i>Why, I ought to take you to the back
room of the station just for the exercise.</i>

06:27.204 --> 06:28.330
<i>Easy, Inspector.</i>

06:28.405 --> 06:30.771
You can't go around arresting
innocent people in this country

06:30.841 --> 06:34.106
<i>just because you don't like the
way they look. Not just yet, anyway.</i>

06:34.177 --> 06:36.077
Who said anything
about arresting you?

06:36.146 --> 06:37.306
<i>If you two are going to fight,</i>

06:37.380 --> 06:39.348
I wish you'd wait
until you've left the house.

06:39.416 --> 06:41.907
<i>It seems so sordid,
given the circumstances.</i>

06:41.985 --> 06:44.510
<i>Sorry, Mrs. Maxfield.
I let my personal feelings</i>

06:44.588 --> 06:46.419
get the better of
my professional conduct.

06:46.490 --> 06:48.720
<i>Careful, Wolf, you
don't have much to spare.</i>

06:48.792 --> 06:50.419
<i>What's the matter, afraid
you won't be able to grab</i>

06:50.494 --> 06:51.688
<i>any of the headlines on
this one, sport?</i>

06:51.762 --> 06:54.788
I'm not looking for headlines. I'm
looking for the man who killed Maxfield.

06:54.865 --> 06:57.333
Maxfield wasn't murdered.
He killed himself.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.265
Jumped off his balcony
into the ocean.

06:59.336 --> 07:02.328
<i>Accident, suicide, body
washed up onshore this morning.</i>

07:02.405 --> 07:03.633
Is that so?

07:04.674 --> 07:07.768
<i>Well, then, I guess I'll just pay the
family my condolences and be on my way.</i>

07:07.844 --> 07:10.472
<i>Well, I'll be watching you, Magnum.
I'll be waiting for you to screw up.</i>

07:10.547 --> 07:12.879
<i>When you do, and you will, I'll be there.</i>

07:14.151 --> 07:15.641
<i>Let's go, boys.</i>

07:19.456 --> 07:21.947
I'm sorry.
Christine called him.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.422
That girl's done
the opposite of everything

07:24.494 --> 07:26.689
I've asked her to do since
the day I married her father.

07:28.231 --> 07:31.132
I was trying to keep everything
quiet until we had a chance to...

07:36.573 --> 07:38.370
Thank you for coming.

07:39.409 --> 07:41.809
<i>According to Wolf, there's no
point in my staying.</i>

07:41.878 --> 07:46.815
Did William Tyler Maxfield seem like the
kind of man who would kill himself to you?

07:48.552 --> 07:50.076
I can't say as he did.

07:51.254 --> 07:54.018
I'll show you the room
where he was last seen alive.

07:57.394 --> 07:59.726
You're not going to tell
me what to do.

07:59.796 --> 08:01.058
I'm free of him at last.

08:01.131 --> 08:03.258
And nobody else is going to
run my life for me ever again.

08:03.333 --> 08:05.460
<i>Don't be a fool, Christine.</i>

08:07.437 --> 08:09.428
Sorry to interrupt
this charming conversation.

08:09.573 --> 08:12.303
What are you doing here?
Mrs. Maxfield called me.

08:12.375 --> 08:15.003
She seems to think there's more to
her husband's death than suicide.

08:16.546 --> 08:18.741
Stop it. Stop it.

08:21.418 --> 08:22.783
<i>Well, he's mistaken.</i>

08:22.853 --> 08:24.650
The police have already been
here. They filed a report.

08:24.721 --> 08:26.120
You wanna tell me
how you see it?

08:26.189 --> 08:28.589
<i>Go ahead, Sam. You always
seem to have all the answers.</i>

08:28.658 --> 08:31.456
I don't see how
it's any of your business.

08:33.029 --> 08:35.429
<i>Oh, you know that,
and I know that,</i>

08:35.498 --> 08:39.400
but I don't think the newspapers
are gonna see it that way.

08:39.469 --> 08:41.937
You being Maxfield's
attorney and all.

08:42.005 --> 08:44.097
<i>Wonder if they might think
you've got something to hide,</i>

08:44.174 --> 08:46.972
<i>closing the casket on Maxfield
so quickly, no questions asked.</i>

08:47.043 --> 08:48.977
<i>Now look here,
you two-bit gumshoe,</i>

08:49.045 --> 08:51.479
<i>if you're looking for a buyout,
you've come to the wrong guy.</i>

08:51.548 --> 08:53.106
I'm not looking to shake
anybody down.

08:53.183 --> 08:55.481
I'm telling you something
about this business stinks.

08:55.552 --> 08:58.544
<i>As far as I can tell, this country
was built on justice for all,</i>

08:58.622 --> 09:00.283
<i>and no matter what
kind of man he was,</i>

09:00.357 --> 09:02.951
I intend to see that Maxfield
gets his fair share of that.

09:03.026 --> 09:05.927
Maxfield loved to print
that kind of fair-play line.

09:05.996 --> 09:07.293
He found it amusing.

09:07.364 --> 09:09.855
<i>He found you amusing, I don't.</i>

09:10.600 --> 09:14.593
<i>We won't be needing your services
around here anymore, Mr. Magnum.</i>

09:14.671 --> 09:16.662
I'll make a deal with you.

09:17.908 --> 09:22.038
<i>You tell me where you were last
night, and I won't call the press.</i>

09:30.420 --> 09:33.014
I brought Father his tea
around 7:00.

09:34.024 --> 09:37.016
I always bring him tea
before he goes to bed.

09:39.029 --> 09:41.623
<i>We talked briefly,
not about much.</i>

09:43.333 --> 09:46.860
I think we almost communicated
better with our silences.

09:48.305 --> 09:51.604
You know the special bond
a father and daughter have.

09:52.542 --> 09:54.339
I can't say that I do.

09:55.545 --> 09:57.445
Maybe someday you will.

09:59.716 --> 10:05.177
<i>Anyway, we talked about the dog
show coming up next month in Austria.</i>

10:08.024 --> 10:10.959
He was always so proud of
the trophies we brought home.

10:13.430 --> 10:16.797
<i>He said he wanted to read
the paper and then go to bed,</i>

10:17.634 --> 10:21.968
so I kissed him good night and that's
the last time I saw him until...

10:25.075 --> 10:27.305
I came up
about 9:00.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.038
I'd drawn his bath.

10:29.479 --> 10:32.175
But he had drifted
off to sleep in his chair.

10:32.716 --> 10:35.549
I guess the scintillating
conversation had worn him out.

10:35.618 --> 10:38.178
<i>Whatever the case,
I didn't want to disturb him.</i>

10:39.055 --> 10:41.489
Then you were the last
person in this room?

10:41.558 --> 10:44.584
No. I came up about midnight.
I couldn't sleep.

10:44.661 --> 10:47.789
<i>I thought, perhaps, I could
interest W.T. In a nightcap.</i>

10:48.765 --> 10:52.132
He was gone and I noticed the
doors to the balcony were open.

10:52.702 --> 10:54.169
I closed them.

11:08.918 --> 11:12.217
The dogs discovered his body
on the beach this morning.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.393
He didn't need his bath.

11:17.494 --> 11:20.292
He knew he was going to wash
up onshore in the morning.

11:20.764 --> 11:23.858
<i>For God's sake, Christine,
get ahold of yourself.</i>

11:28.505 --> 11:31.497
<i>The Reverend Bentley,
to pay his respects.</i>

11:31.808 --> 11:33.105
I hope I'm not intruding.

11:33.176 --> 11:34.404
Myron.

11:34.477 --> 11:37.503
<i>Oh, Myron, it was so awful.</i>

11:38.815 --> 11:40.976
I came just as soon as I heard.

11:41.051 --> 11:42.541
If there's anything
that I can do...

11:42.619 --> 11:45.019
Can you think of any reason why
Maxfield would want to kill himself?

11:45.088 --> 11:46.646
Any recent business reverses?

11:46.723 --> 11:47.747
No.

11:47.824 --> 11:49.519
An illness that was going
to rob him of his health?

11:49.592 --> 11:51.116
I thought he was going
to outlive us all.

11:51.194 --> 11:53.754
He had recently complained
of a touch of indigestion.

11:53.830 --> 11:57.527
That's hardly the kind of illness that
would make a man contemplate suicide.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.465
Was there anybody else
in this house last night?

11:59.536 --> 12:00.560
No.

12:02.005 --> 12:04.838
<i>Well, that leaves us with only
one way to look at this thing.</i>

12:04.908 --> 12:07.877
Someone in this room murdered
William Tyler Maxfield.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.128
Murder? I don't understand.
I thought that...

12:19.205 --> 12:21.765
Don't be ridiculous. I've
listened to all I'm going to.

12:21.841 --> 12:24.401
<i>Christine, go pack your bags.
We're leaving tonight for Boston.</i>

12:24.477 --> 12:26.138
I'm not going back.

12:26.212 --> 12:28.407
You have no choice
in the matter.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.881
You can't let him talk
to me like this. Tell him.

12:30.950 --> 12:32.144
Tell him what?

12:32.218 --> 12:34.778
<i>No more questions, Mr. Magnum. Tell him what?</i>

12:34.854 --> 12:37.288
That Myron and I were
secretly married last week.

12:39.625 --> 12:41.058
You married Christine?

12:43.462 --> 12:44.622
<i>So that's it, is it?</i>

12:44.697 --> 12:47.257
<i>No, it's not.
Now look here...</i>

12:47.333 --> 12:49.893
<i>No, you look here, you
sniveling little opportunist.</i>

12:49.969 --> 12:51.960
<i>When you saw Christine,
you saw dollars.</i>

12:52.038 --> 12:54.097
<i>Well, she's my ward now
and I'm going to do exactly</i>

12:54.173 --> 12:55.299
what her father was going to do.

12:55.374 --> 12:56.432
I'm going to annul the marriage.

12:56.509 --> 12:57.806
You can't talk to me like that.

12:57.877 --> 12:59.401
Even in this
decadent part of the world

12:59.478 --> 13:01.207
there are laws protecting
underage females.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.145
Don't think I won't see
you rot in jail

13:03.215 --> 13:05.046
before I let you get your
grimy hands on her money.

13:05.117 --> 13:07.085
Her money. You act
like it's your money.

13:07.153 --> 13:08.381
Get out.

13:08.854 --> 13:12.517
<i>Well, are you just going to stand
there and let him talk to you like this?</i>

13:12.758 --> 13:14.123
Get out!

13:17.496 --> 13:19.396
You haven't heard
the last from me.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.228
<i>Oh, I think we have.</i>

13:21.767 --> 13:23.632
How could you do this to me?

13:25.705 --> 13:27.832
Go to your quarters
and pack your things.

13:35.347 --> 13:37.838
<i>You seem to have everything
under control, Caldwell.</i>

13:39.185 --> 13:42.951
<i>Alicia, if you'll excuse us for a
moment, I need to talk to Mr. Magnum.</i>

13:45.357 --> 13:47.188
What about me?
What about you?

13:47.259 --> 13:48.920
I don't want to go to Boston.

13:48.994 --> 13:52.361
<i>It's immaterial to me what
you do, one way or the other.</i>

13:52.431 --> 13:55.628
Aren't you being a little hasty about
leaving? If William was murdered...

13:55.701 --> 13:57.464
<i>It was an accident, Alicia.</i>

13:57.536 --> 13:59.060
<i>The sooner you come to
terms with that, the better.</i>

13:59.138 --> 14:01.538
I suggest you start
making some plans

14:01.607 --> 14:03.541
for after the reading
of the will.

14:10.049 --> 14:12.210
Stop by my room
before you leave.

14:13.219 --> 14:14.686
I need to speak to you.

14:28.167 --> 14:29.930
So what have we got here?

14:30.002 --> 14:31.196
A daughter who wants
to get married

14:31.270 --> 14:33.363
<i>and a controlling, domineering
father who won't allow it.</i>

14:33.439 --> 14:35.168
I'm not interested
in discussing Christine.

14:35.241 --> 14:37.209
So the daughter plots to
get rid of the one impediment

14:37.276 --> 14:39.972
<i>to her imagined wedded bliss, her father.</i>

14:40.579 --> 14:43.707
I believe in a day's wage for a day's work.

14:44.016 --> 14:48.453
<i>You've put in several hours, however
fruitless your investigation has been.</i>

14:48.521 --> 14:49.954
<i>Oh, I wouldn't say
it's been fruitless.</i>

14:50.022 --> 14:52.217
Will this cover your expenses?

14:58.631 --> 14:59.962
<i>There's $1,000 here.</i>

15:00.032 --> 15:01.693
That's not enough?

15:02.168 --> 15:03.760
You know it is.
Good.

15:03.836 --> 15:07.067
Then that should conclude our
business dealings with each other.

15:08.774 --> 15:10.799
It's enough to make
me forget about Christine

15:10.876 --> 15:13.174
and consider what
your motives for murder are.

15:15.681 --> 15:18.548
The butler will show you out.
I've got some packing to do.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.954
<i>Thomas Magnum,
Private Investigator.</i>

17:09.494 --> 17:10.655
<i>Hello, precious.</i>

17:10.729 --> 17:13.721
<i>Oh, Thomas. I was starting
to get worried about you.</i>

17:13.799 --> 17:15.699
I heard a report on the radio.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.792
They're calling Maxfield's
death a suicide.

17:17.869 --> 17:19.701
<i>Oh, don't believe everything
you hear, precious.</i>

17:19.771 --> 17:22.332
I need you to find
something out for me.

17:22.407 --> 17:25.172
<i>Go down to Maxfield's office
at the Gazette, ask around,</i>

17:25.243 --> 17:26.905
see what you can
get on Sam Caldwell.

17:26.979 --> 17:28.412
I got a hunch
he's got money problems

17:28.480 --> 17:30.209
that disappeared with
Maxfield out of the picture.

17:30.282 --> 17:31.874
Sam Caldwell?

17:31.951 --> 17:33.043
<i>Yeah, that's the one.</i>

17:33.118 --> 17:35.916
<i>Oh, and see what you can dig up
on a Bible-thumper named Bentley.</i>

17:35.988 --> 17:37.421
I'll get on it right away.

17:37.523 --> 17:39.047
That's my girl.

17:39.825 --> 17:42.487
Mr. Caldwell said you
needed some assistance.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.119
<i>No, I'm fine.</i>

17:47.633 --> 17:49.430
I'll find my
way out. Thanks.

17:49.802 --> 17:53.932
<i>Mr. Magnum, sometimes it's best
not to look into things too closely.</i>

17:54.673 --> 17:57.767
It spoils
the illusion of perfection.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.310
I'll keep that in mind.

18:12.791 --> 18:15.316
<i>Oh, Thomas. I'm so frightened.</i>

18:15.694 --> 18:17.127
Everything's happening so fast.

18:17.196 --> 18:20.461
I was afraid you wouldn't come.
That I'd never see you again.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.699
<i>Careful, angel.
The walls have ears.</i>

18:23.769 --> 18:25.066
<i>Oh, what am I going to do?</i>

18:25.137 --> 18:28.573
You're going to go to Boston with Caldwell
and play the part of the bereaved widow.

18:28.640 --> 18:30.699
How can I? After what's happened between us?

18:30.776 --> 18:33.142
<i>The very wealthy,
bereaved widow.</i>

18:33.212 --> 18:34.873
You'll think badly of
me when I'm gone.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.608
I'll try not to think
of you at all.

18:36.682 --> 18:39.310
<i>I'm not a bad person,
Thomas. Of course you're not.</i>

18:39.385 --> 18:41.148
I loved William.
So you said.

18:41.220 --> 18:44.712
<i>I did. Even though he
abandoned me romantically,</i>

18:44.790 --> 18:47.281
I devoted my life to him.

18:47.726 --> 18:50.695
Not like that spoiled
little brat he doted on.

18:50.996 --> 18:54.898
<i>Ah, Christine. I thought
that name would come up.</i>

18:54.967 --> 18:56.730
You don't know how
she broke his heart.

18:56.802 --> 19:01.398
She couldn't stand the thought that maybe
her father had found happiness with me.

19:01.473 --> 19:05.910
<i>I know we're much too close in age for
her to ever think of me as a mother, but...</i>

19:05.978 --> 19:09.414
<i>I had hoped, for his sake,
that we could be friends.</i>

19:13.685 --> 19:18.588
That's very good. How long have you been
practicing this pretty little speech?

19:18.657 --> 19:19.817
Thomas...

19:19.892 --> 19:21.985
Did you get a chance to try it
out on Maxfield before he died?

19:22.061 --> 19:24.291
<i>Oh, don't be cruel to me.
Not now.</i>

19:24.363 --> 19:25.728
Oh.

19:26.598 --> 19:29.829
<i>I'm sorry, angel. You
just took me by surprise.</i>

19:30.736 --> 19:32.727
So let me get this straight.

19:32.805 --> 19:35.069
You think Maxfield died
of a broken heart

19:35.140 --> 19:37.734
brought on by the thoughtless
actions of his pampered daughter.

19:37.810 --> 19:41.837
No. I think she's
the one who murdered him.

19:41.914 --> 19:44.849
Christine? She couldn't find her
way to the powder room without help.

19:44.917 --> 19:47.818
Don't you see?
It's all so clear.

19:48.253 --> 19:51.347
William was going to have
her marriage annulled.

19:51.423 --> 19:52.856
<i>She's willful,</i>

19:54.827 --> 19:57.057
used to getting what she wants.

19:57.129 --> 20:00.292
<i>And what about you, Alicia?
What do you want?</i>

20:00.999 --> 20:04.435
<i>I want William's murderer
put behind bars, that's all.</i>

20:07.206 --> 20:08.673
You are good.

20:10.409 --> 20:12.502
You won't let Caldwell
scare you off the case?

20:12.578 --> 20:16.514
<i>Oh, I couldn't do that. I have
my reputation to think about.</i>

20:16.915 --> 20:18.576
Thomas.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.520
<i>When William first
hired you, I thought</i>

20:22.955 --> 20:25.321
perhaps you and I
would have a brief interlude.

20:26.158 --> 20:29.286
<i>And when it was over, I'd be
left with William and my memories.</i>

20:31.463 --> 20:33.590
But now I'm not sure
what's going to happen to me.

20:35.033 --> 20:38.560
<i>You'll land on your feet,
Alicia. Your type always does.</i>

20:45.577 --> 20:47.909
<i>I knew Maxfield had
been murdered all right.</i>

20:47.980 --> 20:50.175
<i>There was no doubt
in my mind about that.</i>

20:50.249 --> 20:51.773
<i>The only problem was
finding the killer</i>

20:51.850 --> 20:54.375
<i>before Caldwell disappeared
with all the evidence.</i>

20:54.453 --> 20:56.683
<i>I decided I'd better get help.</i>

21:00.058 --> 21:01.491
Go away.

21:01.560 --> 21:03.084
<i>Hard at work, I see.</i>

21:03.162 --> 21:05.995
<i>Oh, it's you, Magnum.
Come in, come in, come in.</i>

21:06.064 --> 21:08.157
I thought you closed shop
at 5:00 sharp every day.

21:08.233 --> 21:11.168
<i>No, they got me here late
working on the Maxfield case.</i>

21:12.671 --> 21:14.138
You know how the Chief is.

21:14.206 --> 21:16.140
<i>What does he care that I
promised my girlfriend, Sheila,</i>

21:16.208 --> 21:18.369
that I would take her to the
double feature at the Bijou tonight?

21:18.443 --> 21:20.638
<i>Suspicion and
Death Takes a Holiday.</i>

21:21.246 --> 21:24.340
I happened to drive by
there on my way over here.

21:24.416 --> 21:28.910
Something tells me that you didn't
come all this way to discuss the movies.

21:29.755 --> 21:32.485
What do you make of
Maxfield? You think he jumped?

21:32.558 --> 21:36.654
It's hard to say. He got beat up
pretty bad when he fell on the rocks.

21:36.728 --> 21:38.662
It could've been suicide.

21:38.730 --> 21:40.357
But not for sure.

21:42.868 --> 21:45.803
Nothing is for sure until I
see it with these two eyes.

21:45.871 --> 21:47.532
You have a theory?

21:49.107 --> 21:50.540
A little one.

21:50.609 --> 21:53.339
Not enough to make
a case out of it yet.

21:53.412 --> 21:57.109
Suppose Maxfield took a beating
before he went in the drink?

21:57.182 --> 21:58.513
It's possible.

21:58.584 --> 22:01.815
He sustained injuries around
his head and shoulders.

22:01.887 --> 22:04.048
Have to be a pretty big
man to overpower him though.

22:04.122 --> 22:05.987
Not if he was sedated.

22:06.792 --> 22:09.784
How long before you'll know the
contents of Maxfield's last supper?

22:11.530 --> 22:14.522
Tomorrow morning if I go to
this double feature tonight.

22:14.600 --> 22:20.470
<i>Funny, I just happen to have a couple
of extra tickets to tomorrow's matinee.</i>

22:22.908 --> 22:24.569
<i>In that case, one hour.</i>

22:25.510 --> 22:27.535
You know where to call me.

22:33.385 --> 22:35.080
He jumped right on it.

22:36.989 --> 22:39.549
<i>Well, I was about ready
to give up and go home.</i>

22:39.958 --> 22:41.926
I had a couple of stops to make.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.552
How'd you make out?

22:43.629 --> 22:45.096
<i>Not so good, I'm afraid.</i>

22:45.163 --> 22:47.097
<i>All the girls are
talking, all right,</i>

22:47.165 --> 22:48.996
but not about the right people.

22:49.067 --> 22:51.592
<i>Caldwell's clean. Well,
at least it looks that way.</i>

22:51.670 --> 22:54.138
But then he's too smart to
leave the obvious clues around.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.071
I was afraid of that.

22:57.276 --> 22:59.938
Hello! What's this?

23:00.012 --> 23:02.810
I'm not quite sure. It was
delivered this afternoon.

23:03.148 --> 23:05.412
<i>I did get something
on the girl, though.</i>

23:05.484 --> 23:06.746
Alicia?

23:06.818 --> 23:08.149
Christine.

23:08.220 --> 23:12.316
<i>Seems like she had a terrible row with her
father in his office downtown last week,</i>

23:12.391 --> 23:13.983
and ran out in tears

23:14.059 --> 23:16.152
and one of the
secretaries swears

23:16.228 --> 23:20.096
she heard Christine threaten to kill her
father if she didn't get what she wanted.

23:20.999 --> 23:22.933
<i>Why, Tiffy, you're a detective.</i>

23:23.001 --> 23:24.491
Does that help you out?

23:24.569 --> 23:27.094
You don't know how much. I
think we just hit the jackpot.

23:27.172 --> 23:30.232
<i>Somebody sent us the goods on
Myron Bentley, Christine's playmate.</i>

23:30.309 --> 23:32.607
Appears he's had
quite some past.

23:32.678 --> 23:35.511
He's left six wives with less
money than when he married 'em.

23:36.181 --> 23:39.275
<i>Here's an arrest record.
Boston, Atlanta, Denver.</i>

23:39.351 --> 23:41.615
No wonder he's bringing
salvation to the West Coast.

23:41.687 --> 23:43.211
Arrests for what?

23:43.288 --> 23:46.280
<i>Petty larceny, breach
of promise, bad checks...</i>

23:52.164 --> 23:53.654
What do I do?

23:55.734 --> 23:57.668
<i>Show him in, Tiffy,
dear. Show him in.</i>

23:58.670 --> 24:01.798
<i>Only, file this where he won't
think of looking for it, will you?</i>

24:15.854 --> 24:17.014
Mr. Magnum.

24:17.089 --> 24:19.922
<i>Come in, Reverend Bentley. Sit
down. What can I do for you?</i>

24:24.696 --> 24:27.790
I think it's more a matter
of what I can do for you.

24:27.866 --> 24:29.993
Is that so? I'm all ears.

24:30.068 --> 24:33.970
<i>I have certain information that I would
be willing to trade or exchange for,</i>

24:34.039 --> 24:36.837
<i>shall I say, a document.</i>

24:38.543 --> 24:40.033
A document?
Yes.

24:40.112 --> 24:42.842
A collection of papers
that Mr. Maxfield assured me

24:42.914 --> 24:45.405
would be in my possession
by early this evening.

24:45.484 --> 24:48.647
<i>And of course, given
today's turn of events...</i>

24:48.720 --> 24:52.019
<i>Yes. Yes, I see your problem.
But what did you come to me for?</i>

24:53.425 --> 24:54.858
You don't have them?

24:54.926 --> 24:56.553
Why should I have them?

24:56.628 --> 24:58.152
But I was led to believe that...

25:00.999 --> 25:02.364
<i>Yes, Tiffy?</i>

25:02.801 --> 25:04.860
<i>No, that's fine.
You can go home.</i>

25:04.936 --> 25:07.837
<i>Oh, and lock up behind you,
will you, precious?</i>

25:08.206 --> 25:12.302
<i>I'm going to have to ask you to put
your hands behind your head, Mr. Magnum.</i>

25:12.944 --> 25:14.070
<i>Why, you...</i>

25:15.847 --> 25:17.781
Please. Do as I say.

25:21.319 --> 25:22.911
Stand up.

25:24.456 --> 25:26.356
Step out into
the middle of the room.

25:30.328 --> 25:33.388
<i>I'm going to have to search
your office, Mr. Magnum.</i>

26:32.524 --> 26:34.458
Look what you did to my tunic!

26:34.526 --> 26:37.825
I get nervous when people
start pointing guns at me.

26:38.296 --> 26:41.925
I'm not leaving here until I get what
I came for. Those papers belong to me.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.969
The hell they do. Maxfield
collected a file on you. A good one.

26:45.036 --> 26:46.697
Good enough to convince you
to stay away from his daughter

26:46.771 --> 26:49.103
<i>once he'd had the marriage
annulled. And for good measure,</i>

26:49.174 --> 26:50.971
<i>he threw in a check for $5,000.</i>

26:51.042 --> 26:52.236
You looked in my wallet?

26:52.310 --> 26:54.175
<i>You were ready to take a
powder, but once Maxfield died,</i>

26:54.246 --> 26:56.612
you decided to go back for the
goods. How am I doing so far?

26:56.681 --> 26:58.114
He had no right
to keep those papers.

26:58.183 --> 26:59.411
Who told you I had 'em?

27:02.020 --> 27:03.112
No one.

27:03.188 --> 27:05.315
<i>All right, have it your way.</i>

27:07.192 --> 27:08.523
What are you going to do?

27:08.593 --> 27:11.255
I'm calling the police. I'm telling
them you went back to see Maxfield.

27:11.329 --> 27:12.728
<i>You fought with him
over the papers,</i>

27:12.797 --> 27:14.458
and in the struggle you
pushed him over the balcony.

27:14.533 --> 27:16.501
That's not how it happened
at all. I did go back there.

27:16.568 --> 27:19.196
<i>He promised me $5,000 and the papers.</i>

27:19.404 --> 27:22.965
He lied. But I didn't
kill him. Someone else did.

27:23.041 --> 27:25.373
He came in while I was there and
hit him over the head with a trophy.

27:25.443 --> 27:26.637
Who?

27:27.846 --> 27:30.144
I don't know.
You got to believe me.

27:30.215 --> 27:32.080
All right. Get out of here.

27:32.150 --> 27:33.845
<i>Stay away from
the Maxfield girl,</i>

27:33.919 --> 27:36.615
unless you want the police
looking into your business.

27:36.988 --> 27:38.649
Can I have my gun?

27:45.764 --> 27:48.096
Put your hands behind your head.

27:49.668 --> 27:52.159
Step out into
the middle of the room.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.169
I intend to search your office.

27:58.243 --> 28:00.643
<i>Okay, I won't stop you.</i>

28:12.424 --> 28:13.789
Alicia.

28:21.681 --> 28:23.478
<i>Oh, Mr. Magnum.</i>

28:25.886 --> 28:27.285
I...

28:28.088 --> 28:29.578
I thought you were...

28:30.991 --> 28:32.424
You thought I was who?

28:32.492 --> 28:34.790
<i>I thought you were
Mr. Caldwell, actually.</i>

28:34.861 --> 28:37.056
We've been waiting
dinner on him.

28:37.230 --> 28:39.095
Where's Mrs. Maxfield?

28:40.767 --> 28:42.496
She's in the study.

28:45.105 --> 28:47.630
<i>It's too late, Alicia,
you've lost. Don't be so sure.</i>

28:47.707 --> 28:49.402
The will says the entire estate goes to me.

28:49.476 --> 28:51.467
Not until you're 25.
Or married.

28:51.545 --> 28:53.604
<i>The money's mine.
Not yet, it isn't.</i>

28:53.680 --> 28:54.977
Thomas.

28:55.682 --> 28:57.479
Sam can annul
the marriage all he wants.

28:57.551 --> 28:59.416
<i>I'll just marry Myron
again, and again, and again.</i>

28:59.486 --> 29:00.953
I'm afraid you won't
be able to do that.

29:01.021 --> 29:03.387
<i>What, are you going to
stop me? I won't have to.</i>

29:04.124 --> 29:05.489
Bentley's dead.

29:06.459 --> 29:07.551
No.

29:07.661 --> 29:09.526
What? How?

29:09.596 --> 29:13.657
<i>If I hadn't been there myself, I'd almost
believe you had nothing to do with it.</i>

29:13.733 --> 29:14.927
You.

29:15.001 --> 29:16.935
What are you talking about? You killed him.

29:17.003 --> 29:19.062
I didn't.
Why would I?

29:19.139 --> 29:21.607
<i>From what I just heard, to keep
Christine from getting her inheritance.</i>

29:23.076 --> 29:24.771
Sit down.

29:25.845 --> 29:27.403
Mind your manners.

29:28.548 --> 29:30.812
<i>All right, Alicia.
Start talking.</i>

29:30.884 --> 29:33.250
You got me into this mess and now
I've got a dead man in my office

29:33.320 --> 29:35.982
and a cop who'd like nothing better
than to put me into San Quentin for it.

29:36.056 --> 29:37.956
<i>Why'd you kill him?
Thomas, I swear to you...</i>

29:38.024 --> 29:39.753
I saw your car drive away.

29:39.826 --> 29:43.023
But I've been here all night.
Then who was driving your car?

29:43.096 --> 29:44.324
I was.

29:45.966 --> 29:47.524
I had to go to
the newspaper office

29:47.601 --> 29:49.592
to get Maxfield's will
out of his safe.

29:49.669 --> 29:51.569
<i>Oh, Sam. Myron is dead.</i>

29:52.305 --> 29:54.830
Then the world is
a slightly better place.

29:55.642 --> 29:56.904
The will?

29:57.143 --> 29:58.440
There are no changes.

29:58.511 --> 30:00.138
I suppose you have
witnesses to testify you were

30:00.213 --> 30:02.306
at the newspaper at the time
Bentley was shot to death.

30:02.382 --> 30:03.974
At least a dozen.

30:04.050 --> 30:06.416
I'll give you exactly three
minutes to get out of here

30:06.486 --> 30:08.010
before I have you
arrested for trespassing.

30:08.088 --> 30:10.022
<i>You've overplayed your
hand, this time, Caldwell.</i>

30:10.090 --> 30:11.352
<i>I'm not playing, Mr. Magnum.</i>

30:11.424 --> 30:13.551
You think you can plot and
scheme and control people's lives.

30:13.627 --> 30:15.219
<i>Well, I'm not going
to let you get away with it.</i>

30:15.295 --> 30:17.320
Two minutes and 40 seconds. I'll be back!

30:30.377 --> 30:31.844
Mr. Magnum...

30:35.148 --> 30:36.581
Could you meet me
in my quarters?

30:36.650 --> 30:38.584
I'm staying in the guest house.

30:38.652 --> 30:42.213
Christine. Don't you want to
hear the reading of the will?

30:43.189 --> 30:44.383
Please.

30:55.068 --> 30:58.060
<i>I knew I had to
search Christine's room fast</i>

30:58.138 --> 31:00.629
<i>before she tumbled
to my little game.</i>

31:53.927 --> 31:55.724
<i>Easy, boys. Easy.</i>

32:03.336 --> 32:04.667
<i>Okay, now.</i>

32:05.238 --> 32:07.297
Let's not do anything foolish.

32:07.507 --> 32:08.974
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

32:09.042 --> 32:10.304
<i>Isis, Osiris. Heel.</i>

32:16.583 --> 32:20.041
You must think I'm very bold
asking you to meet me here.

32:20.120 --> 32:22.918
What difference does
it make what I think?

32:22.989 --> 32:26.083
I think it makes all the
difference in the world.

32:27.660 --> 32:29.525
Will you have a drink?

32:29.796 --> 32:32.629
I don't trust a man
who won't have a drink.

32:40.039 --> 32:42.132
I feel like

32:42.475 --> 32:46.775
every bleak moment of my
existence on this earth so far

32:47.213 --> 32:52.207
has led inexorably into the
horrifying events of the past 24 hours.

32:56.256 --> 33:00.124
Have you ever known what it's like to
be a virtual prisoner of your own life?

33:00.193 --> 33:02.991
I'm afraid I never
get that philosophical.

33:03.830 --> 33:06.390
<i>Well, perhaps if you'd
been raised by a father</i>

33:06.466 --> 33:09.560
whose sole aim was to
control and dominate you.

33:10.103 --> 33:14.164
<i>I've been bullied, threatened and
abused since the day I was born.</i>

33:16.176 --> 33:19.634
<i>You know, I thought for a
fleeting moment when Father died,</i>

33:20.013 --> 33:23.005
that perhaps I was about
to be granted my freedom.

33:24.350 --> 33:26.443
But I was only
to change jailers.

33:26.553 --> 33:27.815
Caldwell.

33:28.154 --> 33:31.885
He handles my estate
until I'm 25. Or married.

33:32.659 --> 33:35.253
He controls
all the money. Everything.

33:35.528 --> 33:38.895
So I'm no better off than
some prisoner on death row.

33:40.700 --> 33:42.600
<i>Well, I'd say</i>

33:43.369 --> 33:45.667
you got a nicer cell than most.

33:47.774 --> 33:52.234
<i>Mr. Magnum, do you think that you could
ever find somebody like me attractive?</i>

33:54.914 --> 33:56.711
In the right circumstance.

33:57.083 --> 34:00.519
I need somebody strong. I need
somebody to take care of me.

34:00.587 --> 34:04.148
<i>I mean, I thought Myron was that
man. But he's no match for Sam.</i>

34:04.224 --> 34:05.919
<i>Oh, I'm not sure who is.</i>

34:05.992 --> 34:09.655
You are. You can stand up
to him. I saw that tonight.

34:11.431 --> 34:14.958
Have you ever considered what it
would be like to be a very wealthy man?

34:17.103 --> 34:19.731
I could make all
your dreams come true.

34:21.341 --> 34:23.309
I'll bet you're good at that.

34:24.244 --> 34:26.007
Let's do it tonight.

34:27.447 --> 34:28.641
Slow down.

34:28.715 --> 34:31.775
<i>No, no, no. See, I know somebody
who can handle all of the paperwork.</i>

34:31.851 --> 34:33.112
Paperwork?

34:33.186 --> 34:34.744
<i>Yes, and by morning
we'll be man and wife.</i>

34:34.821 --> 34:37.312
And then Sam will be
out in the cold.

34:37.389 --> 34:41.918
<i>You'd like to see Sam get what's
coming to him, wouldn't you?</i>

34:45.665 --> 34:46.654
Wouldn't you?

34:48.034 --> 34:50.764
Sure. Sure. I'd like
to see him get that.

34:51.237 --> 34:53.295
<i>Well, then
tell me you'll help me.</i>

34:53.373 --> 34:55.170
<i>I'll help you, angel.</i>

35:23.903 --> 35:25.393
<i>What are you doing
here, princess?</i>

35:25.471 --> 35:26.870
<i>Wolf called me at home,
looking for you.</i>

35:26.940 --> 35:28.703
I didn't know where you were. What happened?

35:28.775 --> 35:30.367
How'd Wolf get here so fast?

35:30.443 --> 35:31.876
An anonymous phone tip.

35:31.945 --> 35:34.277
Someone heard the shots you
fired and called the station.

35:34.347 --> 35:36.315
The shots that I...

35:37.083 --> 35:39.176
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

35:40.186 --> 35:42.086
You're gonna pin this one on me.

35:42.155 --> 35:43.782
<i>Yeah, you telling me
you didn't do it?</i>

35:43.856 --> 35:47.155
<i>No. No, there's no use in me pulling
the wool over your eyes, Inspector.</i>

35:47.226 --> 35:48.557
I confess.

35:48.728 --> 35:51.561
<i>I lured Bentley up here, I tricked
him into pulling a gun on me</i>

35:51.631 --> 35:53.360
<i>and then when he had
his back to this window,</i>

35:53.433 --> 35:55.230
<i>I ran downstairs, shot him twice in the back</i>

35:55.301 --> 35:57.792
and then I tipped you off just in case
you thought it was another suicide.

35:57.870 --> 35:59.735
What are you boys looking for?

35:59.806 --> 36:00.864
<i>All right, all right, all right.</i>

36:00.940 --> 36:02.305
Why did Bentley come to see you?

36:02.375 --> 36:05.208
He wanted some advice
on his Sunday sermon.

36:08.381 --> 36:11.373
<i>Laugh your way all the way
to the gas chamber, wise guy.</i>

36:14.887 --> 36:17.651
The coroner called. He wanted to
make sure you got this message.

36:17.724 --> 36:19.089
<i>Thanks, precious.</i>

36:19.158 --> 36:21.683
<i>Bring me that file
on Bentley, will you?</i>

36:24.597 --> 36:25.859
So what's it gonna be?

36:25.932 --> 36:27.661
You gonna take me downtown
and give me the third degree?

36:27.734 --> 36:29.258
Or did you bring
the rubber hoses with you?

36:29.335 --> 36:30.700
<i>If you didn't kill
Bentley, who did?</i>

36:30.770 --> 36:32.897
The same person who killed
William Tyler Maxfield.

36:37.210 --> 36:38.677
Hello?

36:39.379 --> 36:41.244
That's fine.
I'll leave right now.

36:41.314 --> 36:43.282
And just where do you
think you're going?

36:43.349 --> 36:46.978
I asked Maxfield's killer
to meet me in 20 minutes.

36:47.186 --> 36:48.653
We can take your car.

37:10.608 --> 37:13.076
<i>I got everyone here,
just as you asked.</i>

37:13.244 --> 37:15.075
<i>Inspector,</i>

37:15.379 --> 37:17.313
remove this man
from the premises.

37:17.381 --> 37:19.815
<i>Oh, I'm not staying, Caldwell.</i>

37:19.884 --> 37:21.146
I'm leaving.

37:21.219 --> 37:25.417
Just as soon as I explain to Inspector
Wolf which one of you killed Maxfield.

37:25.490 --> 37:26.889
Inspector!

37:28.493 --> 37:29.653
Go on.

37:29.861 --> 37:32.591
<i>Well, from the first it was
obvious it was Caldwell.</i>

37:32.663 --> 37:34.460
This is insufferable.

37:35.066 --> 37:37.034
<i>Please, Mr. Caldwell.</i>

37:39.103 --> 37:41.162
You seemed like
the most likely suspect.

37:41.239 --> 37:44.766
<i>Cold, calculating. Smart
enough to cover your own tracks.</i>

37:44.842 --> 37:48.039
And the only one strong enough to
throw Maxfield off that balcony.

37:48.112 --> 37:49.511
That's true.

37:50.348 --> 37:54.785
<i>I figured you doped him up a
little, put something into his tea.</i>

37:55.520 --> 37:59.718
<i>As the mickey took hold, he accidentally
knocked his tea cup to the floor.</i>

37:59.790 --> 38:01.690
<i>You waited till he was out cold,</i>

38:01.759 --> 38:04.057
<i>then you dragged him
over to the balcony,</i>

38:04.128 --> 38:08.087
<i>threw his body into the ocean
and closed the balcony doors.</i>

38:08.666 --> 38:11.464
<i>You cleaned up behind yourself, all right.</i>

38:12.537 --> 38:15.768
But you missed this little piece of china.

38:17.942 --> 38:19.842
I didn't kill Maxfield.

38:20.645 --> 38:23.045
I know.
I realized that later.

38:23.147 --> 38:25.615
You didn't drug him.
You didn't have to.

38:25.683 --> 38:28.584
Maxfield was already dead before
you even got into the room.

38:31.589 --> 38:35.218
But that doesn't solve the
problem of the broken china cup.

38:37.995 --> 38:40.828
<i>And then, there's
this odd object.</i>

38:42.033 --> 38:44.331
<i>Looks like it broke
off a trophy, doesn't it?</i>

38:44.402 --> 38:45.630
One of mine.

38:46.103 --> 38:48.799
Maybe you can tell me what it was
doing on the floor near the balcony.

38:48.873 --> 38:50.067
<i>Well, I don't know.</i>

38:50.141 --> 38:52.803
The coroner said that Maxfield was
beaten on the head and shoulders

38:52.877 --> 38:57.371
numerous times with a heavy object
before he took his midnight swim.

38:57.448 --> 38:58.506
No...

38:58.583 --> 38:59.675
There's no way to prove that.

38:59.750 --> 39:02.583
Abrasions and contusions could
have been caused by the wave action.

39:02.653 --> 39:04.416
<i>They could've, but they weren't.</i>

39:04.488 --> 39:07.980
Your late husband
saw him get hit.

39:11.596 --> 39:13.188
<i>He was going to
confront Maxfield</i>

39:13.264 --> 39:15.323
<i>and force him to give him
the blackmail folder.</i>

39:15.399 --> 39:18.857
<i>But before he could do that,
somebody else came into the room.</i>

39:18.936 --> 39:23.464
<i>Somebody who beat Maxfield over the head
with a heavy trophy half a dozen times.</i>

39:24.208 --> 39:26.676
<i>I'm already onto
that trail, Magnum.</i>

39:26.744 --> 39:29.178
<i>Get your things,
I'm taking you in.</i>

39:29.547 --> 39:31.174
But I didn't do it.

39:31.248 --> 39:33.842
<i>I never said you did, angel.</i>

39:34.218 --> 39:35.879
Alicia did that.

39:36.020 --> 39:37.419
Don't be ridiculous.

39:38.089 --> 39:40.057
Why would I want to
kill my own husband?

39:40.157 --> 39:42.387
I guess you're the only
one who can answer that.

39:42.860 --> 39:45.693
You know yourself that I
have no claim to the will.

39:45.997 --> 39:48.591
<i>If I murdered William,
I'd lose everything.</i>

39:48.666 --> 39:52.124
<i>Oh, not if you could make it
look like Christine did it.</i>

39:53.004 --> 39:54.369
That's insane.

39:54.872 --> 39:57.204
That's also a bit
of a long shot.

39:57.508 --> 40:00.568
<i>But not beyond you, my darling.</i>

40:00.645 --> 40:01.805
Arrest her.

40:01.879 --> 40:04.439
<i>You're getting ahead of me, angel.
Alicia didn't kill your father.</i>

40:04.515 --> 40:05.573
But you just said...

40:05.650 --> 40:07.311
I said she hit him over the
head with a heavy trophy.

40:07.385 --> 40:09.876
But Maxfield was already
dead when she did.

40:09.954 --> 40:11.854
And how do you figure that?

40:14.825 --> 40:18.488
I kept coming back to the china cup
and what it was doing on the floor.

40:18.596 --> 40:20.928
So I had my friend at
the Coroner's office check

40:20.998 --> 40:23.592
very carefully the contents
of Maxfield's stomach.

40:25.002 --> 40:26.492
He was poisoned.

40:30.307 --> 40:31.740
With this.

40:33.744 --> 40:36.372
Designed to look like
he had a heart attack.

40:36.447 --> 40:38.347
She planted it in my room.

40:38.416 --> 40:39.883
Oh!

40:40.351 --> 40:43.081
<i>I never said I found
it in your room, angel.</i>

40:46.490 --> 40:48.117
Looking for this?

40:48.192 --> 40:51.059
<i>You know, the one thing
I couldn't figure was motive.</i>

40:51.128 --> 40:52.390
<i>What's in it, angel?</i>

40:52.463 --> 40:53.828
Benzedrine?

40:55.900 --> 40:59.165
<i>All right, I'm only going to go
through this once, so listen good.</i>

40:59.236 --> 41:01.727
Christine got into a
little trouble with Bennies.

41:01.806 --> 41:04.434
<i>And when Daddy wouldn't come through
with the money to keep her in supply,</i>

41:04.508 --> 41:06.772
she had to look to other
ways to get her fix.

41:06.844 --> 41:08.607
Eventually all the
avenues dried up.

41:08.679 --> 41:10.237
She had to get her
hands on her own money.

41:10.314 --> 41:13.841
<i>There were only two ways,
murder and marriage.</i>

41:14.218 --> 41:16.448
<i>Marriage didn't work
out so good,</i>

41:16.520 --> 41:19.489
so she started slowly
poisoning her father

41:19.557 --> 41:21.650
hoping it would look
like a natural death.

41:22.359 --> 41:23.724
And it did.

41:27.264 --> 41:29.323
It looked so good

41:29.400 --> 41:32.733
that Alicia thought it
was a heart attack.

41:32.803 --> 41:36.762
She knew that would leave her
penniless. And she couldn't have that.

41:36.841 --> 41:39.901
So she hit Maxfield over the head
with one of Christine's trophies

41:39.977 --> 41:42.707
hoping that it would look to
everyone like Christine did it.

41:42.780 --> 41:46.739
<i>Don't, Thomas, don't. We can
still get away from all this.</i>

41:46.817 --> 41:48.079
Stop now before you go too far.

41:48.152 --> 41:50.382
<i>It's too late for that, Alicia.</i>

41:51.088 --> 41:53.454
It's gone too far already.

41:56.427 --> 42:00.022
<i>With her step-daughter up on a murder
rap, Alicia would get the money.</i>

42:00.664 --> 42:02.689
But she hadn't
counted on Caldwell.

42:04.168 --> 42:06.693
Caldwell came across the
murder frame and believed it.

42:06.771 --> 42:08.671
<i>He knew if Christine
went to the gas chamber,</i>

42:08.739 --> 42:11.105
he wouldn't have
control of Maxfield's estate.

42:14.044 --> 42:17.480
But that wasn't the real
reason you tried to rescue.

42:17.548 --> 42:21.609
<i>Christine from what you thought
was her murderous act, was it, Sam?</i>

42:22.686 --> 42:23.710
No.

42:24.021 --> 42:25.249
No.

42:26.524 --> 42:31.291
What you didn't realize was that Sam
Caldwell was in love with you all along.

42:34.365 --> 42:35.855
How did you know?

42:39.970 --> 42:41.437
I'm not sure.

42:43.174 --> 42:48.009
<i>Anyway, he cleaned it up, he even tried
to bribe me with this thousand dollars.</i>

42:48.245 --> 42:51.544
<i>You'll want that for evidence. So,
once he was in, he couldn't get out.</i>

42:51.615 --> 42:53.207
<i>When he thought Bentley
was going to talk,</i>

42:53.284 --> 42:55.445
<i>pointing the finger at
Christine, he had to kill him,</i>

42:55.519 --> 42:56.986
framing Alicia.

42:57.655 --> 42:58.986
Exactly.

42:59.056 --> 43:02.958
<i>Book 'em all, Inspector. Murder
One and accessory after the fact.</i>

43:06.697 --> 43:08.426
<i>Wait a minute, Magnum.</i>

43:10.234 --> 43:12.327
<i>If they're all going to jail,</i>

43:12.503 --> 43:14.994
who's going to get
Maxfield's money?

43:49.707 --> 43:53.074
<i>"As Magnum drove off into
another beautiful sunset,"</i>

43:53.644 --> 43:55.168
"he wondered"

43:56.380 --> 43:59.508
"how many times he
could go through this"

43:59.984 --> 44:02.316
"before his heart
broke for good."

44:10.995 --> 44:13.020
Well? What do you think?

44:15.532 --> 44:17.193
I think it's

44:18.602 --> 44:21.901
quite possibly the finest piece
of fiction I've ever come across.

44:21.972 --> 44:23.496
You're kidding.

44:24.308 --> 44:26.242
<i>The style is strong
and aggressive,</i>

44:26.310 --> 44:28.403
<i>the characterization is clean,</i>

44:28.479 --> 44:32.745
<i>the story innovative,
yet comfortingly familiar...</i>

44:32.816 --> 44:34.681
<i>Well, it's my first effort,</i>

44:34.752 --> 44:38.483
<i>and I'm sure I'll
have to, you know,</i>

44:39.023 --> 44:42.049
<i>change a word or two here and
there, but you really like it?</i>

44:42.126 --> 44:43.320
Like it?

44:43.394 --> 44:47.956
<i>Not since Dashiell Hammett have
I seen such raw, pure talent.</i>

44:49.466 --> 44:52.094
Wait a minute. You're comparing
me to Dashiell Hammett?

44:52.169 --> 44:56.128
A sort of Raymond Chandler
meets Erle Stanley Gardner...

44:56.206 --> 44:57.537
Black and white.

44:57.608 --> 45:00.168
<i>An Agatha Christie bumps up
against Arthur Conan Doyle,</i>

45:00.244 --> 45:01.836
there's an image.

45:01.912 --> 45:04.107
Excuse me.
I'm still dreaming.

45:06.483 --> 45:08.610
I have to get back to sleep.

45:15.926 --> 45:17.359
<i>Magnum.</i>

45:19.129 --> 45:20.687
<i>Magnum!</i>

45:22.066 --> 45:23.499
<i>Magnum!</i>

45:32.776 --> 45:34.107
Magnum.

45:37.281 --> 45:39.613
<i>Higgins, what are
you doing here?</i>

45:39.883 --> 45:41.976
You asked me to come down.

45:42.419 --> 45:45.217
You implored me to
stop by before I left.

45:46.757 --> 45:48.452
Why are you wearing that suit?

45:49.426 --> 45:50.893
You know why I'm
wearing this suit.

45:50.961 --> 45:53.623
I am going to the Anglo-Hawaiian
Royal Yachting Costume Brunch.

45:53.697 --> 45:56.165
And I'm late. Now what is it
you wanted me to see about?

45:56.767 --> 45:58.098
Right.

45:59.870 --> 46:04.466
I'm sorry. I've
been up all night

46:04.975 --> 46:06.499
working.

46:06.577 --> 46:07.771
Yes?

46:08.379 --> 46:09.744
And...

46:16.854 --> 46:18.185
No.

46:20.057 --> 46:22.150
<i>I just wanted to say,</i>

46:23.193 --> 46:25.184
have a good time at the party.

46:25.262 --> 46:27.059
Don't worry about a thing here.

46:27.131 --> 46:31.329
<i>I'll be on the job, making sure no harm
comes to Robin's Nest in your absence.</i>
