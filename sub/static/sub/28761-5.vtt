WEBVTT

00:11.094 --> 00:13.096
[sobbing]

00:15.098 --> 00:16.099
[Tom] Penny?

00:19.269 --> 00:20.729
Sweetheart, what's wrong?

00:22.063 --> 00:24.566
Why are they putting
these awful things online?

00:28.069 --> 00:30.363
Honey, I don't know. Come here, come here.

00:34.784 --> 00:37.454
-[Penny] They're saying you killed Mom.
-Oh.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.416
Honey, nobody believes that.

00:42.083 --> 00:44.002
They're just being mean. Come here.

00:44.669 --> 00:46.087
I am so sorry.

00:47.589 --> 00:49.299
I am so sorry.

00:55.138 --> 00:56.055
Is it bad today?

00:56.639 --> 01:00.185
Over-the-counter pain relievers?
I might as well be popping Skittles.

01:00.769 --> 01:01.978
I hate leaving you like this.

01:02.062 --> 01:05.273
-Mmm-hmm. I know.
-I've been doing some research.

01:05.356 --> 01:08.276
What about arranging
for a sober companion?

01:08.359 --> 01:10.695
A babysitter? No, thank you.

01:10.779 --> 01:15.492
We have resources.
There are options, solutions.

01:15.575 --> 01:17.327
Aside from you quitting your job?

01:18.953 --> 01:20.789
Is that really what you're asking?

01:20.872 --> 01:24.292
Some wives would.
Some husbands wouldn't have to be asked.

01:26.503 --> 01:28.797
I can't get into this right now.

01:28.880 --> 01:32.050
Just think about
bringing somebody in to help.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.596
Call me if you need me.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.935
[Emily] The president is laser-focused
on the issues,

01:42.018 --> 01:43.102
as are the American people,

01:43.186 --> 01:46.147
not on the vile garbage
that washes up on the ugly Net.

01:46.231 --> 01:47.982
-[line beeping]
-Look, I've gotta take another call.

01:48.775 --> 01:49.901
Hey, Mom, what's going on?

01:49.984 --> 01:51.402
I'm in the hospital.

01:51.486 --> 01:52.695
What? What happened?

01:52.779 --> 01:56.324
Evidently, I have a blood clot,
so they're keeping me a few days.

01:56.407 --> 01:58.076
Jesus! Why didn't you call me sooner?

01:58.159 --> 02:00.829
-I know how stretched thin you are.
-[Emily]<i> Mom, stop.</i>

02:00.912 --> 02:03.081
-Did they tell you what caused it?
-They haven't said.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.707
They haven't said
or you haven't asked them?

02:04.791 --> 02:07.001
I don't like bothering people.

02:07.085 --> 02:08.169
And I do?

02:08.253 --> 02:09.295
It's your job.

02:09.379 --> 02:10.797
[Emily] <i>I can be there in the morning.</i>

02:10.880 --> 02:12.715
And I will bother them,
since I'm such a pro.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.634
[Carrie] <i>But you have the debate tomorrow.</i>

02:14.717 --> 02:16.553
Yeah, in Orlando.
It's only a couple of hours away.

02:16.636 --> 02:18.721
You don't have to, honey.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.807
Mom, I'm coming. I love you. Goodbye.

02:21.516 --> 02:22.600
[sighs]

02:23.351 --> 02:25.937
Our next guest is
national security advisor

02:26.020 --> 02:28.231
and vice-presidential candidate,
Aaron Shore,

02:28.314 --> 02:30.316
who many of you also know
by his other title,

02:30.400 --> 02:31.943
DC's most eligible bachelor.

02:32.026 --> 02:33.695
Thank you very much. It's my pleasure.

02:33.778 --> 02:36.322
The first presidential debate
is tomorrow night.

02:36.406 --> 02:39.033
Have you been helping prep
President Kirkman on foreign policy?

02:39.117 --> 02:41.411
The president doesn't need my
or anyone else's help

02:41.494 --> 02:43.413
when it comes to foreign
or domestic affairs.

02:43.496 --> 02:45.540
We're certainly looking forward
to tuning in.

02:45.623 --> 02:46.958
We assume you'll be attending

02:47.041 --> 02:49.043
with your now live-in girlfriend,
Isabel Pardo.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.712
Yes, we'll be there together.

02:50.795 --> 02:52.505
-First time living with someone?
-It is.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.966
Has it been an adjustment,
remembering to put the toilet seat down?

02:55.049 --> 02:56.593
-[laughs]
-You are remembering?

02:56.676 --> 02:59.929
I'm managing to, but I'm sure
that people are more interested

03:00.013 --> 03:02.432
in the vision President Kirkman
will put forward tomorrow night.

03:02.515 --> 03:04.559
Of course, but our viewers would kill me

03:04.642 --> 03:07.395
if I didn't ask about this rumor
of a marriage proposal.

03:07.478 --> 03:09.272
Well, we're all focused
on the election now,

03:09.355 --> 03:12.191
and President Kirkman's
sensible centrist agenda.

03:12.275 --> 03:13.318
So, no proposal?

03:13.401 --> 03:16.195
Only that people tune in tomorrow night
to hear the exciting plans

03:16.279 --> 03:18.823
President Kirkman has
for the next four years.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.992
They're saying
that I had my wife murdered!

03:21.075 --> 03:22.785
That Alex was a Russian spy?

03:22.869 --> 03:24.662
This is an all-time low,
and that's saying a lot,

03:24.746 --> 03:28.041
given the fact that our politics
have become so poisonous, so rancid.

03:28.124 --> 03:30.251
I can't believe Moss would stoop this low.

03:30.335 --> 03:34.047
Let's not jump to conclusions.
This could be just some crackpot wing nut.

03:34.130 --> 03:35.465
Moss hasn't released a statement yet.

03:35.548 --> 03:38.551
Which is as bad as condoning it.
Porter's team condemned it right away.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.345
They think we're responsible
for the Alzheimer's leak.

03:40.428 --> 03:42.263
[Lorraine] Possibly, yes,
but there is a silver lining.

03:42.347 --> 03:46.267
More voters are gonna sympathize with you
than believe this ludicrous bullshit.

03:46.351 --> 03:49.604
There is no silver lining to this crap.
It's an affront to anything decent.

03:49.687 --> 03:51.481
[Seth] Then say that. I'm getting asked

03:51.564 --> 03:53.733
by every major news outlet in this country
for an official statement.

03:53.816 --> 03:56.027
No, I'm not gonna dignify this
with a response.

03:56.110 --> 03:59.697
And spare me the lecture on how we need
to retaliate every time we're attacked.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.824
We're not giving this any oxygen.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.285
The administration says nothing.
The campaign says nothing.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.496
Understood?

04:06.579 --> 04:07.872
Understood, sir.

04:07.956 --> 04:10.041
Thank you, Mr. President.
[whispers] Let's go.

04:14.045 --> 04:16.047
[theme music playing]

04:22.929 --> 04:26.140
[Hannah] While you're stuffing your face,
let's review what we know.

04:26.224 --> 04:29.560
The women who were infected with the flu
at the Toronto clinic,

04:29.644 --> 04:32.021
they all received an injection
from this male nurse,

04:32.105 --> 04:33.356
who's obviously in the wind.

04:33.940 --> 04:36.776
But no one at the apartment complex
mentions an injection,

04:36.859 --> 04:38.111
so how did they get sick?

04:38.194 --> 04:40.905
Tainted water, aerosolized.

04:41.489 --> 04:44.909
The vents? The HVAC system.

04:45.868 --> 04:48.830
We'll have to go back there
and pull the security footage.

04:48.913 --> 04:50.957
After you finish your death plate,
of course,

04:51.040 --> 04:52.542
and, hopefully, before your infarction.

04:54.168 --> 04:57.380
These people are all eminently deserving
of presidential pardons.

04:57.463 --> 05:00.049
Inarguable is what we're looking for
in an election year.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.010
If POTUS loses, which he won't,

05:02.093 --> 05:04.595
we're only gonna have a couple of months
to get this done.

05:05.179 --> 05:06.848
I'm prepared to back up every case.

05:06.931 --> 05:09.851
Which is precisely why I selected you
to spearhead this.

05:09.934 --> 05:11.227
You're no bullshit,

05:11.311 --> 05:14.480
so I knew you were gonna be able
to back up all of these names.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.941
Like this one. Miguel Salcedo.

05:17.025 --> 05:21.362
Seditious conspiracy?
Accessory to bombings, wasn't he?

05:21.446 --> 05:22.447
He was an activist professor--

05:22.530 --> 05:25.783
"Activist" being a euphemism
for "violent revolutionary"?

05:25.867 --> 05:29.787
He advocated independence for Puerto Rico,
and, yes, he was a nonviolent skeptic,

05:29.871 --> 05:32.623
but the feds sentenced him to 70 years.

05:32.707 --> 05:35.626
That's six times what a murderer got
in the 1980s.

05:35.710 --> 05:36.753
People died.

05:36.836 --> 05:39.088
Not being in the mold of Gandhi
isn't a crime.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.507
-So, this is a free speech issue.
-Exactly.

05:41.591 --> 05:42.675
Then say that.

05:42.759 --> 05:45.720
"Constitutionally protected,"
that's another term you can use.

05:45.803 --> 05:48.097
-So he stays on the list?
-For now.

05:48.181 --> 05:51.976
But this is gonna rattle some cages.
You need to hone your defense chops.

05:52.060 --> 05:55.313
I am not gonna be the last person
you're gonna have to make this case to.

05:56.439 --> 05:59.817
I've been calling and texting Stephanie.
No response.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.569
Texting and calling?

06:01.652 --> 06:03.488
-Not good?
-Not so much.

06:03.571 --> 06:05.907
[sighs] Ghosted by my sperm child.

06:05.990 --> 06:07.283
What a touching term of endearment.

06:07.366 --> 06:09.410
When I think of her that way,
it hurts less.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.497
Maybe giving her a locket
was a little overwhelming.

06:12.580 --> 06:15.583
I just mean, even young women
with conventional parentage

06:15.666 --> 06:18.294
have complicated feelings about things,
so just give her some space.

06:18.377 --> 06:19.587
This is all your fault.

06:19.670 --> 06:21.464
Okay, my turn.

06:21.547 --> 06:23.758
I spoke to my mom this morning,
and she's in the hospital.

06:23.841 --> 06:26.052
-Is she gonna be okay?
-I hope so.

06:26.135 --> 06:30.181
She never wants to feel like a burden,
which makes me feel burdened.

06:30.264 --> 06:33.267
And I just...
I feel like a horrible daughter.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.436
You're a wonderful daughter.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.355
You're also
an irreplaceable senior staffer

06:37.438 --> 06:39.816
on an all-encompassing
presidential campaign.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.568
-You're doing the best you can.
-Thank you.

06:43.319 --> 06:45.571
-But no one is irreplaceable.
-You are.

06:48.157 --> 06:49.742
Please don't make me cry right now.

06:49.826 --> 06:54.122
3:00 p.m., you have an economic brief
with the NEC.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.832
-And then, your final debate prep.
-[sighs]

06:55.915 --> 06:58.835
Every time I think the debate
can't be worse than the debate prep,

06:58.918 --> 07:01.129
I think, "Oh, God, of course it can."

07:01.212 --> 07:03.923
You have a habit of landing on your feet.
I am not worried.

07:04.006 --> 07:06.634
-[chuckles]
-By the way, I've been doing research

07:06.717 --> 07:08.928
about drug decriminalization programs.

07:09.595 --> 07:14.183
In Portugal, substance abuse
is now being treated as a medical problem.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.770
The number of people using heroin
has been cut in half.

07:18.521 --> 07:22.150
The drug-induced death rate is
five times lower than anywhere in Europe.

07:22.233 --> 07:25.695
-How?
-Users receive a citation

07:25.778 --> 07:27.697
and go before a dissuasion panel.

07:27.780 --> 07:31.617
Ultimately, the government
provides them with support,

07:31.701 --> 07:33.703
not imprisonment or shame.

07:33.786 --> 07:37.165
I understand why this is important to you,
with everything you're going through.

07:37.915 --> 07:42.753
In our rural communities, the top concerns
are economics and drug addiction.

07:42.837 --> 07:47.675
A policy change modeled after this
proven success could be a game-changer.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.219
You could provide something

07:50.303 --> 07:53.723
that would give countless people
suffering with this problem

07:53.806 --> 07:56.934
not just hope, but an actual chance.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.061
Educate me.

07:59.145 --> 08:03.149
Put together a working group
and get back to me with a report, a plan.

08:03.232 --> 08:07.195
And if at that time I'm still president,
then we'll talk about implementation.

08:07.278 --> 08:09.113
-Thank you, Mr. President.
-Thank you, Mars.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.157
Good afternoon, everybody.

08:11.240 --> 08:14.702
With the presidential debate coming up,
I have no new announcements.

08:14.785 --> 08:17.413
So, I will take your questions. Philip.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.624
Does President Kirkman have any response

08:19.707 --> 08:22.376
to the release of the photos
of the late First Lady's car accident?

08:22.460 --> 08:24.879
Guys, we're not addressing this, okay?
Jamie.

08:24.962 --> 08:28.132
Does the president plan to resume therapy
in light of these events?

08:28.216 --> 08:31.260
Come on, guys.
You have to ask actual questions, right?

08:31.344 --> 08:34.180
There must be real questions
about real news. Dennis.

08:34.263 --> 08:36.349
Does President Kirkman
feel any responsibility

08:36.432 --> 08:37.683
for these conspiracy theories?

08:37.767 --> 08:40.520
You should be ashamed of yourself.
All of you.

08:40.603 --> 08:44.398
This story is 100% trash.

08:44.482 --> 08:45.942
This is fever-swamp clickbait

08:46.025 --> 08:49.153
for moral degenerates
and conspiracy whack jobs.

08:49.237 --> 08:53.324
I'm sure whoever created this filth
thanks you for being his or her accomplice

08:53.407 --> 08:55.535
in trumpeting this revolting desecration.

08:55.618 --> 08:58.746
Whatever happened to standards?
What happened to ethical practices?

08:58.829 --> 09:01.290
What happened for concern
for the First Children?

09:03.417 --> 09:06.754
Guys, that's their mother!
That's his wife!

09:07.338 --> 09:10.591
I hope none of you ever has to see
your loved one's remains

09:10.675 --> 09:13.052
showcased by every media outlet
around the world,

09:13.135 --> 09:15.137
and then have to explain to your children

09:15.221 --> 09:18.182
what these people, who should know better,
were thinking.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.977
This isn't journalism!

09:23.145 --> 09:24.814
I am so disgusted.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.568
President Kirkman is disgusted.

09:30.069 --> 09:31.612
Are you happy?

09:31.696 --> 09:33.990
There's your answer. We're disgusted...

09:34.657 --> 09:36.951
with every single one of you.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.787
Write that.

09:40.371 --> 09:42.248
Just talk some sense into your girlfriend.

09:42.331 --> 09:44.333
No, that's not how it works.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.128
Well, however it works,

09:47.211 --> 09:52.008
the administration can't include
Miguel Salcedo in this round of pardons.

09:52.091 --> 09:53.676
Moss would make him out to be

09:53.759 --> 09:57.138
the Latino Osama bin Laden
from now until the polls close.

09:57.221 --> 09:58.431
I can talk to the president.

09:58.514 --> 10:00.641
Honey, I can talk to the president.

10:00.725 --> 10:03.769
We need to cut this off at the pass,
and that means Isabel.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.397
Don't let her be the reason that we lose.

10:10.401 --> 10:11.402
[knocking on door]

10:11.944 --> 10:14.196
Which part of "say nothing"
didn't you understand?

10:14.280 --> 10:16.532
I gave specific instructions
not to respond,

10:16.616 --> 10:18.701
and you sing a goddamn aria?

10:18.784 --> 10:21.662
I apologize, sir.
They just kept pushing, and I lost it.

10:21.746 --> 10:24.707
Their job is to push it.
Yours is to not lose it.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.501
Your job is to protect this administration
and, above all, my family!

10:27.585 --> 10:30.171
Instead, you gave the story
three more days of airplay

10:30.254 --> 10:32.173
because you couldn't control
your emotions.

10:32.256 --> 10:34.175
Over something
that didn't even concern you.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.635
I meant no disrespect.

10:35.718 --> 10:36.969
We're done here.

10:40.348 --> 10:43.517
Why don't you take a few days?
Give him time to cool off.

10:43.601 --> 10:46.812
You mean not come to work?
Hey, everything I said there was true.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.189
It doesn't matter.

10:48.272 --> 10:51.067
You don't get to indulge your anger
on the president's behalf.

10:51.150 --> 10:55.112
Go home, reflect on it while you still
have a job to come back to.

10:58.074 --> 11:00.451
[Aaron] President Kirkman claims
he's not a politician.

11:00.534 --> 11:02.411
Since he's served in office
for over two years

11:02.495 --> 11:04.747
without a major accomplishment,
I'm inclined to agree.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.916
I would note to Mr. Porter that presiding

11:06.999 --> 11:09.335
over the complete reconstruction
of the federal government

11:09.418 --> 11:11.587
might be considered an accomplishment.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.089
[Emily] I thank the president
for his service,

11:13.172 --> 11:16.634
but the title is "commander in chief,"
not "caretaker in chief."

11:16.717 --> 11:20.388
It is time to return our highest office
to someone more plainly qualified.

11:20.471 --> 11:22.431
[Aaron] Former president Moss declined
to run again

11:22.515 --> 11:25.851
after the traumatic passing of his wife,
putting country first.

11:26.435 --> 11:28.396
President Kirkman,
faced with a similar tragedy,

11:28.479 --> 11:30.815
exhibited sufficient mental instability

11:30.898 --> 11:33.025
that his own vice president
sought his impeachment.

11:33.109 --> 11:36.278
I received counseling
during that incredibly difficult time.

11:36.862 --> 11:41.242
Unfortunately, my opponents used
my personal grief for political gain.

11:41.325 --> 11:44.286
The intemperate outburst today by
the president's communications director,

11:44.370 --> 11:47.289
who speaks for the president,
hardly points to emotional equilibrium.

11:47.373 --> 11:50.459
Okay, enough! What the hell is going on?

11:50.543 --> 11:52.420
This is a complete waste of my time!

11:52.503 --> 11:54.422
You had an opportunity
to use this exercise

11:54.505 --> 11:58.008
to help me hone and articulate my views
on real political issues.

11:58.092 --> 12:01.178
Instead, you've chosen to make this
about petty, personal attacks

12:01.262 --> 12:03.556
that are bullshit. I am done.

12:03.639 --> 12:07.143
Thank you both. That outburst is
exactly what can't happen.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.645
You cannot bring
Angry Kirkman to the debate.

12:09.728 --> 12:13.149
Your opponents want a repeat
of the State of the Union meltdown.

12:13.232 --> 12:16.068
If you do that, we lose.
It's as simple as that.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.404
When they poke, you must pivot.

12:18.487 --> 12:21.198
I'm not a child
that needs to be tricked into a lesson.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.159
Don't ever do this to me again.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.663
[Lorraine] My job is to prepare him.

12:27.746 --> 12:30.207
He can be so mad at me
that he spits nails,

12:30.291 --> 12:33.961
as long as he doesn't carry that energy
on to the stage tomorrow.

12:36.046 --> 12:38.674
[Hannah] Right there. Who is that?

12:38.757 --> 12:40.843
-Does he work here?
-I don't think so.

12:41.677 --> 12:42.720
Keep running it.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.432
He's deliberately hiding his face.
We need to see his face.

12:46.515 --> 12:47.641
Can you pull up another angle?

12:50.227 --> 12:53.772
Looks like we got our nurse from Toronto.
Zoom in on that plate for me.

12:54.482 --> 12:58.152
Hey, Dianne. We got a hit
on our rogue nurse. Illinois plates.

12:58.235 --> 13:00.321
Echo-Charlie-Two-One-Five-Lima-Charlie.

13:04.992 --> 13:06.785
-[Mars] Mmm.
-[both chuckle]

13:12.583 --> 13:13.834
I have to go.

13:16.378 --> 13:17.379
[sighs]

13:18.005 --> 13:21.175
Wham-bam. Gonna leave some money
on the nightstand, too?

13:21.258 --> 13:26.639
[sighing] Things were...
not great this morning, if you must know.

13:26.722 --> 13:28.224
If I must know?

13:28.307 --> 13:30.643
I know you don't like it
when I talk about home.

13:32.394 --> 13:34.563
[Reena] Well, I like it less
when you don't talk to me at all,

13:34.647 --> 13:36.565
which is happening
more and more these days.

13:37.399 --> 13:39.068
Am I wasting my time here?

13:40.528 --> 13:42.530
You bring wine, you fuck me, you leave.

13:42.613 --> 13:46.742
Let's not do this tonight, please.
I got a lot going on.

13:46.825 --> 13:48.244
You always have a lot going on.

13:49.537 --> 13:52.998
-Are you ever gonna leave your wife, Mars?
-Where did that come from?

13:53.082 --> 13:55.376
I'm your mistress. It's in the handbook.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.586
I never promised that.

13:57.670 --> 14:01.215
No, you've been nothing if not careful,
God knows.

14:01.298 --> 14:03.968
-I can't leave Lynn.
-Right now or ever?

14:04.051 --> 14:04.969
I've got to go.

14:06.387 --> 14:11.141
This was lovely.
We can talk all about this next time.

14:11.809 --> 14:15.145
I don't know how many next times
I've got left in me.

14:17.356 --> 14:20.192
If I wanted to play second fiddle,
I would've stayed with my ex.

14:23.320 --> 14:24.572
I'm sorry.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.909
But you knew my situation when this began.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.538
Yes, you were clear.

14:34.081 --> 14:37.585
And I was okay with it,
or I accepted it, at least.

14:38.335 --> 14:39.336
That's on me.

14:42.047 --> 14:43.757
This is becoming unbearable.

14:47.845 --> 14:50.306
You either wanna be here
or you wanna be there.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.810
The clock's ticking
on your having it both ways.

15:01.859 --> 15:03.861
Sorry about the debate prep ambush.

15:04.445 --> 15:07.823
Lorraine can be a blunt instrument,
but I know why she did it.

15:08.616 --> 15:09.491
Thank you.

15:09.575 --> 15:12.953
Moss is an old hand at this, and I am not.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.997
-How are you feeling about it?
-[chuckles]

15:15.581 --> 15:16.916
Scared shitless.

15:18.167 --> 15:19.460
What concerns you most?

15:19.543 --> 15:23.797
How to turn my policies into soundbites.
Not wanting to make any gaffes.

15:23.881 --> 15:26.091
Wanting to be spontaneous
without being reckless.

15:26.175 --> 15:27.801
I'm trying to keep that all in my head

15:27.885 --> 15:30.971
while staring straight down a clock
that doesn't stop ticking,

15:31.055 --> 15:33.349
knowing that 100 million people
are watching,

15:33.432 --> 15:38.103
judging every bead of sweat,
furrowed brow, twitch of the lip.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.022
-Is that all?
-[chuckles]

15:40.105 --> 15:42.608
Moss has been rehearsing for this
his whole life.

15:42.691 --> 15:45.444
Not Porter. He's a businessman,
not a political pro.

15:45.527 --> 15:47.237
That reminds me of the old joke.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.740
What do you do when a bear charges you?

15:49.823 --> 15:52.117
Don't panic.
You don't have to outrun the bear,

15:52.201 --> 15:53.994
just the guy standing next to you.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.998
You're not a performer, so don't perform.

15:58.082 --> 16:00.084
Just keep showing the voters
who you really are,

16:00.167 --> 16:01.585
and the rest'll take care of itself.

16:01.669 --> 16:05.005
Anyways, enough about the debate.
What did you wanna talk to me about?

16:05.506 --> 16:07.383
My mother's in the hospital again.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.677
Oh, Emily, I am so sorry.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.345
I'm leaving tonight to see her,

16:11.428 --> 16:14.431
and I'm not exactly sure
what I'll be walking into, so...

16:14.515 --> 16:16.058
She's gonna try and protect you.

16:17.518 --> 16:18.644
I wanted to let you know,

16:18.727 --> 16:20.479
in case I don't make it in time
for the debate.

16:20.562 --> 16:23.607
Don't give it a second thought.
Go be with your mother.

16:25.025 --> 16:27.778
Until you've experienced
that kind of loss,

16:27.861 --> 16:30.739
it's impossible to know
the depth of its finality.

16:32.324 --> 16:33.659
Thank you, sir.

16:33.742 --> 16:35.077
Emily...

16:36.370 --> 16:37.621
come here.

16:41.792 --> 16:44.128
-Good luck.
-You, too.

16:47.673 --> 16:48.549
You know what we should do?

16:48.632 --> 16:52.553
We should just quit our jobs,
open up a bistro. What do you think?

16:52.636 --> 16:55.431
One of us would probably
have to learn how to cook first.

16:55.514 --> 16:59.393
Shoot, my mama taught me how to cook
before I could barely see over the stove.

16:59.476 --> 17:04.440
You know, hot water corn bread,
short ribs, collard greens.

17:05.315 --> 17:07.985
I might even teach you
a little something-something.

17:11.321 --> 17:12.239
What's the matter?

17:13.741 --> 17:17.077
There's something we should talk about.

17:20.330 --> 17:21.457
So?

17:23.250 --> 17:24.251
I'm...

17:28.672 --> 17:29.882
undetectable.

17:30.466 --> 17:31.925
Like, you're on the DL? [chuckles]

17:32.676 --> 17:33.594
No.

17:34.511 --> 17:35.846
I'm HIV positive.

17:40.267 --> 17:41.894
I never put you at risk.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.647
We used a condom. We were careful.

17:45.731 --> 17:50.027
Why wouldn't you tell me that you were
HIV positive before we had sex?

17:50.110 --> 17:51.820
I didn't wanna scare you off.

17:52.362 --> 17:55.282
I know that might feel fucked up...

17:57.117 --> 17:59.036
but it doesn't have to be a big thing.

17:59.119 --> 18:02.498
You don't get to decide
not to be upfront with me

18:03.540 --> 18:05.584
and then just act like it's no big deal.

18:08.504 --> 18:11.173
-This is a huge fucking deal.
-You're okay.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.677
I promise.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.262
Yeah, so you say.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.598
Okay, that's not fair.

18:20.808 --> 18:23.143
You really wanna talk about what's fair
in all this?

18:25.479 --> 18:27.397
You took away my right to choose.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.024
I understand how you feel.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.026
No, I don't think you do.

18:31.110 --> 18:36.990
'Cause I'm hearing a whole lot of,
"I didn't tell you, but it's no big deal.

18:39.076 --> 18:39.952
You're okay."

18:42.037 --> 18:43.997
Instead of an actual apology.

18:44.581 --> 18:49.253
No, I'm not apologizing for having HIV.
I take my meds.

18:49.336 --> 18:52.131
By taking care of myself,
I made sure you wouldn't catch it.

19:00.013 --> 19:01.640
Two suits for an overnight trip?

19:01.723 --> 19:04.768
Better too many than too few,
or nothing at all.

19:04.852 --> 19:07.521
Oh, I'll toss something in a bag
in the morning.

19:09.314 --> 19:12.192
So, I hear you have Miguel Salcedo
on your pardon list.

19:12.276 --> 19:14.278
You really think it's the right time?

19:14.862 --> 19:16.029
Lorraine put you up to this?

19:17.447 --> 19:19.867
Of course she did, and you let her.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.243
This isn't about Lorraine,

19:21.326 --> 19:23.495
this is about becoming a liability
to the campaign.

19:23.579 --> 19:25.956
You mean me becoming a liability.

19:26.039 --> 19:27.875
Wow, Aaron. No one would guess

19:27.958 --> 19:30.294
that she's got her hand up your ass,
moving your mouth.

19:30.377 --> 19:34.256
Has it ever occurred to you that I might
disagree on the pardon on principle?

19:34.339 --> 19:37.050
I mean, the man inspired an action
that took lives.

19:37.134 --> 19:38.302
You can't just erase that.

19:38.385 --> 19:42.306
His indictment was based on him
being a brown man with unpopular rhetoric.

19:42.389 --> 19:46.185
Agitating for bomb-throwing
isn't unpopular, Isi. It's seditious.

19:46.268 --> 19:49.396
Miguel has First Amendment rights
like anyone else.

19:49.479 --> 19:50.898
Free speech is not an absolute.
You know that.

19:50.981 --> 19:52.774
You can't shout fire in a crowded theater.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.067
You know that's not a thing, right?

19:54.151 --> 19:55.736
What are you talking about?
Of course it is.

19:55.819 --> 19:58.780
No, not according
to a constitutional lawyer I dated.

19:58.864 --> 20:01.617
Well, let's by all means
take your old boyfriend's words

20:01.700 --> 20:03.035
against Oliver Wendell Holmes'.

20:03.118 --> 20:06.205
Holmes' opinion was overturned
by the Supreme Court.

20:06.288 --> 20:09.958
To break the law, speech has to incite
"imminent lawless action."

20:10.042 --> 20:11.001
Says your ex-flame.

20:11.084 --> 20:13.962
Look, you have an entire suitable list
of fucking pardons.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.547
Why'd you have to risk it all for him?

20:15.631 --> 20:16.965
Because it's right!

20:17.049 --> 20:18.592
It's not gonna be any less right
in December.

20:18.675 --> 20:20.010
He could be dead by then.

20:20.093 --> 20:21.303
We could be packing up our offices!

20:21.386 --> 20:24.973
Do you not understand the position
you're putting the president in? Or me?

20:25.057 --> 20:27.851
The only reason why you even have
a seat at the table right now

20:27.935 --> 20:29.519
is because I'm running for VP.

20:29.603 --> 20:30.812
This is so typical.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.440
You always think that your work
is more important than mine.

20:33.523 --> 20:34.900
That's because it is.

20:38.612 --> 20:39.988
You know what, Aaron?

20:40.072 --> 20:44.284
Find yourself another Latina
to be your arm candy tomorrow.

20:46.411 --> 20:49.248
I'll be busy doing my insignificant work!

20:55.671 --> 20:57.047
What's this?

20:57.130 --> 21:00.801
We haven't been intimate in a while,
which is my fault.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.429
But I'm feeling better,

21:06.014 --> 21:08.767
and I thought tonight could be the night.

21:10.143 --> 21:13.021
-What a nice surprise.
-[chuckles]

21:28.495 --> 21:29.579
[chuckles]

21:36.378 --> 21:40.757
You know... it happens to a lot of men.

21:40.841 --> 21:41.967
My age?

21:43.510 --> 21:46.972
There's no need to be...
anything embarrassed about.

21:48.181 --> 21:49.308
I'm not.

21:57.774 --> 21:59.067
Do you still love me?

22:00.861 --> 22:01.987
Of course I do.

22:02.863 --> 22:04.781
You're just not attracted to me anymore?

22:05.365 --> 22:07.534
Don't say that. Don't even think that.

22:11.496 --> 22:14.166
It's been a long day.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.418
I'm tired.

22:19.129 --> 22:20.464
Of course.

23:07.427 --> 23:10.639
Mars has already spoken to me
about Miguel Salcedo,

23:10.722 --> 23:12.682
and I have to be honest,
I have my concerns.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.726
But he wanted me to hear you out.

23:14.810 --> 23:17.521
There was never a single piece
of hard evidence presented

23:17.604 --> 23:21.775
that he plotted, or conspired with,
or even personally knew the bombers.

23:21.858 --> 23:25.695
Yet he was charged
and found guilty of seditious conspiracy,

23:25.779 --> 23:28.657
and sentenced to 70 years
in a federal prison.

23:28.740 --> 23:32.035
That's six times the average sentence
for a convicted murderer at the time.

23:32.119 --> 23:34.955
His words incited violence. People died.

23:35.038 --> 23:36.414
They were angry words,

23:36.498 --> 23:39.501
which he felt were commensurate
with the injustices he saw.

23:39.584 --> 23:44.256
And those same words also inspired
breakfast programs for children,

23:44.339 --> 23:47.217
community initiatives
and affordable housing.

23:47.300 --> 23:48.301
[Tom] Hmm.

23:49.761 --> 23:52.806
Free speech has to be for everyone,
not just the majority.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.559
Otherwise,
it's not free or protected speech.

23:55.642 --> 23:58.478
It's sanctioned speech. And the state has
no business enforcing it.

23:58.562 --> 23:59.771
Well put, sir.

23:59.855 --> 24:02.399
Elections are
highly-charged political times.

24:02.482 --> 24:06.027
There's no way to ignore that.
It's a reality that has to be factored in.

24:06.111 --> 24:10.240
Having said that, win or lose,
after the election, I could pardon him.

24:10.323 --> 24:13.493
Well, he's an 86-year-old man
in declining health.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.287
The next eight weeks
are not inconsequential

24:15.370 --> 24:16.746
to whatever time he might have left.

24:18.123 --> 24:20.834
-Thank you, Isabel.
-Thank you, Mr. President.

24:32.470 --> 24:33.805
-Where's Isabel?
-She's not coming.

24:33.889 --> 24:34.848
Why not?

24:34.931 --> 24:37.976
We got in a huge fight
over the Salcedo pardon, thanks to you.

24:38.059 --> 24:39.102
Why thanks to me?

24:39.186 --> 24:41.396
You're the one who persuaded me
to talk sense into her.

24:41.479 --> 24:42.981
I didn't say to do it badly.

24:43.064 --> 24:45.442
From now on,
leave my personal life out of this, okay?

24:45.525 --> 24:48.570
You don't have a personal life.
Aren't you getting that?

24:48.653 --> 24:50.906
You two are polling
as America's sweethearts.

24:50.989 --> 24:53.241
I'm not saying
that's worth two dozen electoral votes,

24:53.325 --> 24:55.243
but it's not negligible either.

24:55.327 --> 24:58.330
You gotta kiss and make up.
The sooner the better.

24:58.413 --> 25:02.000
It'd be best to have her on the swing
through the Southwest and California.

25:10.383 --> 25:11.509
Mom.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.514
Sweetheart, you came.

25:16.598 --> 25:17.557
Hi.

25:19.559 --> 25:21.102
How are you feeling?

25:21.186 --> 25:23.396
[chuckles] Better than I look.

25:25.398 --> 25:27.359
This isn't just a blood clot, is it?

25:29.444 --> 25:30.570
Have you eaten?

25:31.321 --> 25:34.950
[voice breaking] Mom.
Please tell me what's going on.

25:35.909 --> 25:37.786
The cancer has spread.

25:42.082 --> 25:43.541
I knew it. [sniffling]

25:46.378 --> 25:49.172
And I'm stopping the chemo.

25:49.256 --> 25:52.425
[crying] No, Mom. You can't stop.

25:53.009 --> 25:55.637
The doctor said it was my choice.

25:56.930 --> 25:57.931
How long?

25:58.974 --> 26:01.977
Months, they think. They don't know.

26:04.312 --> 26:06.606
I need you to do something for me.

26:07.607 --> 26:09.276
Anything you want.

26:10.068 --> 26:12.279
I need you to make me a go-pack.

26:12.362 --> 26:13.488
A go...

26:13.571 --> 26:17.951
That's a mixture of pills I can take
when it's time.

26:19.035 --> 26:20.829
When it's time?

26:22.497 --> 26:23.832
For me to go.

26:23.915 --> 26:26.167
That's what you meant
by you had other plans?

26:26.251 --> 26:29.379
You're considering assisted suicide?

26:32.215 --> 26:34.801
No, I won't do that. That's...

26:35.635 --> 26:37.554
It's what I want.

26:37.637 --> 26:40.974
I'm gonna stay here
and we are gonna talk about this.

26:43.601 --> 26:44.644
No.

26:46.813 --> 26:48.898
I'm going to go back to sleep now.

26:50.483 --> 26:53.194
-And you're gonna go to the debate.
-No, Mom. No.

26:55.322 --> 26:58.033
I'm not going anywhere. [chuckles]

27:01.077 --> 27:03.997
You go to the debate
and come back tomorrow.

27:05.999 --> 27:09.044
I will have a list
of what I need you to get.

27:18.762 --> 27:20.096
This is it.

27:20.180 --> 27:21.556
There's the car from the video.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.183
[Hannah] Yeah.

27:24.142 --> 27:25.185
Are we going in?

27:25.977 --> 27:28.480
We're waiting for Dianne
to call with the warrant.

27:30.357 --> 27:32.692
So, this is a stakeout?

27:34.944 --> 27:36.446
We should've stopped for snacks.

27:37.781 --> 27:40.492
Quinoa chips, something.

27:43.912 --> 27:46.581
-[rock music playing over speakers]
-[music stops]

27:47.957 --> 27:50.710
-Guess we'll just sit in silence.
-What a great idea.

28:00.136 --> 28:01.513
[Alex]<i> You look the part.</i>

28:03.264 --> 28:06.059
[Tom] I know this is gonna
change everything for us,

28:06.142 --> 28:07.519
but I have to do it.

28:08.561 --> 28:10.063
If I don't, then...

28:12.982 --> 28:14.150
I just have to.

28:16.444 --> 28:17.821
You still on my side?

28:19.280 --> 28:23.827
I'm always on your side... Mr. President.

28:23.910 --> 28:25.078
[knocking on door]

28:29.416 --> 28:30.333
Ready?

28:41.052 --> 28:41.970
Let's do this.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.476
Aren't you supposed to be in Orlando,
Prince Charming?

28:50.395 --> 28:52.981
Yeah, well, after my psychotic episode,

28:53.064 --> 28:56.651
I was encouraged
to take a couple days off.

28:57.402 --> 28:59.404
Aren't you supposed to be
at Aaron's debate?

28:59.487 --> 29:01.573
No, 'cause I have a job.

29:01.656 --> 29:02.949
You guys got into a fight.

29:04.284 --> 29:05.535
You need a drink.

29:05.618 --> 29:07.662
[applause on TV]

29:07.746 --> 29:08.747
[Seth] Here we go.

29:10.415 --> 29:13.877
[moderator] Tonight's debate will consist
of six 15-minute segments.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.296
There will be two-minute answers
to the first question...

29:16.379 --> 29:18.631
-Look who's almost not late.
-[Emily sighs]

29:18.715 --> 29:19.924
-[moderator]<i> We drew lots earlier.</i>
-[Aaron] Hey.

29:20.008 --> 29:21.259
[moderator] <i>Mr. Porter</i>
<i>got the first question.</i>

29:21.342 --> 29:22.969
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

29:23.052 --> 29:26.014
[moderator] <i>What is your vision for</i>
<i>healing racial divisions in this country?</i>

29:26.097 --> 29:31.060
<i>My hope is that one day</i>
<i>we will live in a color-blind country...</i>

29:31.144 --> 29:32.979
Color-blindness isn't a thing!

29:33.062 --> 29:37.275
...where every person is
given the opportunities they deserve.

29:37.358 --> 29:41.237
I believe in true fairness,
not positive discrimination.

29:41.321 --> 29:46.743
The white student with a 4.0 GPA
should not be denied college admission

29:46.826 --> 29:49.954
simply because a minority student
with lower grades

29:50.038 --> 29:53.541
needs to be accepted
in order to meet some arbitrary quota.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.794
Now, you take President Kirkman,
for instance.

29:55.877 --> 29:59.255
Why, he wouldn't be standing here today
if he'd been rejected from Cornell.

29:59.339 --> 30:02.634
Ladies and gentlemen,
do not let President Moss fool you.

30:03.343 --> 30:07.430
This has been the argument made by men
of privilege and power for far too long.

30:07.514 --> 30:10.850
There is absolutely no evidence
that supports the claim

30:10.934 --> 30:13.603
that African American, Latino
or Asian students

30:13.686 --> 30:16.481
are preventing white students
from going to school.

30:16.564 --> 30:18.775
And for your own edification,
Mr. President,

30:18.858 --> 30:21.653
as grateful as I am
for my time and education

30:21.736 --> 30:24.697
that I received from Cornell,
Cornell was not my first choice.

30:24.781 --> 30:26.991
The truth is most American students

30:27.075 --> 30:29.869
are not accepted
to their first choice of college.

30:29.953 --> 30:30.954
It's simple math.

30:31.037 --> 30:33.957
Now, if you wanna understand
what I think is truly unfair,

30:34.040 --> 30:36.125
it's the rising cost of higher education.

30:36.209 --> 30:39.712
Predatory loans
putting students in such great debt

30:39.796 --> 30:45.134
that education is once again becoming
a privilege exclusively for the wealthy.

30:46.135 --> 30:49.055
Myles Lee. I bow down.

30:49.681 --> 30:51.933
You're a true wizard and Net master.

30:52.016 --> 30:56.980
Dontae Evans. I do digital, far less ably,
for the Kirkman campaign.

30:57.063 --> 30:59.274
I heard of you.
You've got skills, man. Pleasure.

30:59.357 --> 31:02.402
I have been goose-chasing that source
of that First Lady dump.

31:03.486 --> 31:05.280
Whoever's behind that is adept.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.407
You think it was me?

31:07.490 --> 31:08.658
You'd have the chops.

31:08.741 --> 31:12.453
President Moss has commissioned
some sketchy stuff, but this wasn't him.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.581
I should get back in there.

31:14.664 --> 31:17.375
Tell you what I'll do. I hear any whispers
in the wind, I'll let you know.

31:18.251 --> 31:19.419
Cool.

31:19.502 --> 31:22.005
[Cornelius on TV]<i> Some of you</i>
<i>might not know this,</i>

31:22.088 --> 31:26.050
<i>but President Kirkman canvassed for me</i>
<i>during my first election.</i>

31:26.634 --> 31:28.928
...that this was an accidental presidency,

31:30.054 --> 31:34.309
that he was daunted,
over-matched and unsure.

31:34.392 --> 31:37.312
That's why he begged me
to come in to help run the country.

31:37.395 --> 31:40.148
But America doesn't need a leader
filled with self-doubt.

31:41.065 --> 31:42.609
America needs strength,

31:43.192 --> 31:45.361
and that's something
neither of my opponents possess.

31:47.071 --> 31:51.326
President Kirkman has been reluctant
to take bold steps in office,

31:51.409 --> 31:53.620
possibly because he wasn't elected.

31:53.703 --> 31:57.624
But ladies and gentlemen,
this is no time for the hesitant.

32:01.836 --> 32:05.798
What a politician calls "hesitant,"
you and I would call "thoughtful."

32:05.882 --> 32:07.300
I'll give you an example.

32:07.383 --> 32:10.136
Earlier this evening,
before I walked out here tonight,

32:10.219 --> 32:12.221
<i>I approved the presidential pardon list,</i>

32:12.305 --> 32:17.185
<i>and on that list will be</i>
<i>Puerto Rican nationalist Miguel Salcedo.</i>

32:17.268 --> 32:18.603
Holy shit!

32:18.686 --> 32:22.649
[Tom] <i>Now, some of you might think of that</i>
<i>as a controversial choice.</i>

32:22.732 --> 32:25.902
And I guarantee you my political
opponents' campaigns right now

32:25.985 --> 32:29.489
are feverishly composing attack ads
as I speak.

32:30.448 --> 32:31.866
<i>But after careful consideration,</i>

32:31.950 --> 32:35.787
<i>I came to the conclusion</i>
<i>that it was simply the right thing to do.</i>

32:35.870 --> 32:37.705
There go the swing states.

32:39.290 --> 32:40.792
Not necessarily.

32:40.875 --> 32:45.046
Now, thoughtful people can disagree,
but it's the thinking that counts,

32:45.129 --> 32:48.508
not political calculations
or knee-jerk demagoguery.

32:49.300 --> 32:53.846
It requires honest, thoughtful
and well-informed thinking.

32:54.681 --> 32:57.308
Something we could do with more
these days.

32:57.392 --> 33:00.687
Now, Miguel Salcedo wasn't imprisoned
for something he did.

33:00.770 --> 33:03.356
He was imprisoned for what he said.

33:03.439 --> 33:05.775
And as much as I might disagree
with his words,

33:05.858 --> 33:09.696
the First Amendment should have protected
his absolute right to say them.

33:10.446 --> 33:14.742
Now, I know that many of you have read
the outrageous conspiracy theories

33:14.826 --> 33:16.619
surrounding my wife's untimely death.

33:17.453 --> 33:19.539
And as vile as I might think they are,

33:19.622 --> 33:22.291
and as hurtful as they've been
to my children,

33:22.375 --> 33:25.336
like it or not, they, too, represent

33:25.420 --> 33:28.589
a free people's right
to a protected speech.

33:28.673 --> 33:29.882
Where is he going with this?

33:29.966 --> 33:32.468
[Tom] <i>Having said that,</i>
<i>you do not have to condone the content.</i>

33:32.552 --> 33:36.222
<i>President Moss has failed to make</i>
<i>any statement of condemnation.</i>

33:36.305 --> 33:40.143
So, I have to ask you, sir,
can you say to me or the American people

33:40.226 --> 33:41.811
that you repudiate those lies,

33:41.894 --> 33:45.440
and that you do not want the vote
of anyone who traffics in such filth?

33:45.523 --> 33:50.278
Well, this is nothing but a stunt,
a transparent attempt for sympathy.

33:50.361 --> 33:52.113
I didn't hear him say it.

33:53.197 --> 33:54.574
Maybe he's being hesitant.

33:55.658 --> 33:57.368
He most certainly isn't being thoughtful.

33:57.452 --> 34:00.788
Ladies and gentlemen,
politics do not need to be this dirty.

34:00.872 --> 34:05.168
And on election day,
you have the power to prove it.

34:06.377 --> 34:07.670
[Lorraine] You saw it yourselves,

34:07.754 --> 34:11.466
but our analytics also indicate
a huge victory for President Kirkman.

34:11.549 --> 34:15.928
I mean, he brought actual passion
and honesty and conviction to a debate.

34:16.012 --> 34:18.097
It was refreshing, wasn't it?

34:18.181 --> 34:21.267
Now, if that's your "yay, we won" face,
it needs some work.

34:22.351 --> 34:23.728
I haven't seen Isabel.

34:25.772 --> 34:27.356
Yeah, we got into an argument.

34:28.608 --> 34:30.818
-That bad?
-Yep.

34:32.945 --> 34:34.280
Things you can't get over?

34:34.363 --> 34:38.576
Everything's a battle with her.
She's always gotta be right.

34:40.244 --> 34:43.581
This is a huge moment in my life,
and she didn't show up for it.

34:47.335 --> 34:49.545
So, I don't think I can get over that.

34:51.464 --> 34:56.010
No matter how many rumors Lorraine spreads
about our perfect relationship.

34:56.094 --> 34:59.764
Yeah, she's hell-bent on making you
the next Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.

34:59.847 --> 35:01.682
-Well, it's a pain in my ass.
-Mmm.

35:02.725 --> 35:03.851
What do you want?

35:05.645 --> 35:06.979
I don't know.

35:13.486 --> 35:15.029
My mom's dying.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.324
Jesus, Em.

35:20.868 --> 35:23.371
She's asked me to help her end her life.

35:26.332 --> 35:29.585
I can only speak in euphemisms.

35:32.630 --> 35:37.510
My mom has asked me
to help her... kill herself.

35:48.020 --> 35:49.939
Thanks again for listening to...

35:50.022 --> 35:53.234
You don't have to thank me for that.
Now or ever.

35:54.193 --> 35:55.611
All right? Come here.

36:09.917 --> 36:13.171
I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have done that.

36:14.422 --> 36:15.715
We shouldn't...

36:22.847 --> 36:23.681
[softly] All right?

36:41.240 --> 36:44.577
You're an amazing girlfriend.
Does Aaron know that?

36:44.660 --> 36:48.789
I mean, you're being amazing to me
and you're not even my girlfriend,

36:48.873 --> 36:51.375
and I didn't even think
that we were friends.

36:52.460 --> 36:53.836
We're not.

36:56.005 --> 36:57.298
[both laughing]

36:58.591 --> 36:59.592
Thank you.

37:30.790 --> 37:31.791
[exhales heavily]

37:38.214 --> 37:39.548
Shit.

37:53.688 --> 37:54.689
[engine starts]

37:54.772 --> 37:58.276
Eli, wake up. That's our guy.

38:01.862 --> 38:03.281
Should we follow him?

38:03.906 --> 38:06.367
No, this is our chance
to see what's in there.

38:06.450 --> 38:07.994
What about the warrant?

38:08.786 --> 38:12.248
It's coming. But in the meantime,
we're bootstrapping it.

38:12.331 --> 38:13.457
"Bootstrapping"?

38:14.458 --> 38:18.087
Technically, we know the warrant's coming,
but we're just gonna get a jump on it.

38:18.170 --> 38:20.047
Following the rules lasted longer
than I expected.

38:21.215 --> 38:23.551
I thought the CIA didn't issue guns.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.886
If you think I'm going in there

38:25.970 --> 38:29.348
in a stand-your-ground state
without my gun, you're crazy.

38:30.474 --> 38:31.726
Let's go.

38:32.935 --> 38:34.729
[Carrie] Hey, sweetheart.

38:35.771 --> 38:41.444
The president did so well last night.
You must have had a lot to do with that.

38:42.820 --> 38:45.031
-I may have prepped him a bit.
-[chuckles]

38:45.906 --> 38:47.033
Come here.

38:59.420 --> 39:01.505
I know how hard this is for you,

39:04.008 --> 39:05.593
but it is what I want.

39:10.723 --> 39:12.224
I'll make a deal with you.

39:12.933 --> 39:14.643
You come stay with me in DC,

39:16.020 --> 39:19.482
'cause if you're gonna do this,
we do it together.

39:24.111 --> 39:25.446
I'll think about that.

39:38.459 --> 39:39.502
I don't see anyone.

39:41.670 --> 39:43.089
Why didn't I think of that?

39:45.883 --> 39:47.093
Just stay close.

39:57.853 --> 40:00.314
Great, another biolab.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.400
See what you can find on that computer.

40:10.616 --> 40:12.118
[Tom] Seth, I'm so glad I found you.

40:12.201 --> 40:14.745
I'm sorry, sir.
I know I'm not supposed to be here.

40:14.829 --> 40:16.831
I just came to pick up some paperwork.

40:16.914 --> 40:20.084
Relax, this is exactly where
you're supposed to be.

40:20.876 --> 40:22.670
I owe you an apology.

40:22.753 --> 40:24.630
But, sir, I'm the one who screwed up.

40:24.713 --> 40:26.507
You didn't do what I asked,

40:27.508 --> 40:30.136
but you told the truth,
and I respect that.

40:30.719 --> 40:31.804
Thank you, sir.

40:33.055 --> 40:36.267
By the way, congrats
on the debate win last night.

40:36.350 --> 40:38.686
You really handed Moss
his ass on a platter,

40:38.769 --> 40:39.812
if I may be so bold.

40:39.895 --> 40:43.774
[chuckling] I have to say,
it felt pretty damn good.

40:43.858 --> 40:46.068
Authenticity goes a long way
with the American people.

40:46.152 --> 40:48.571
I can't even tell anymore
if I'm being authentic

40:48.654 --> 40:50.531
or if I'm performing up there.

40:51.240 --> 40:54.326
But you, you spoke from your heart,

40:55.035 --> 40:56.787
and that really says something.

40:57.538 --> 40:58.664
You're a good man.

40:59.790 --> 41:00.708
Ooh.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.169
Maybe you should go home
and freshen up a bit.

41:03.252 --> 41:04.920
You smell like a Kentucky distillery.

41:05.004 --> 41:08.090
Yeah, I didn't think
I was gonna run into you, so...

41:09.091 --> 41:10.092
[chuckles]

41:14.889 --> 41:16.015
Can we talk?

41:17.183 --> 41:18.267
[Isabel] You can talk.

41:26.817 --> 41:30.154
[scoffs] For Christ's sake, Isi,
just look at me, please?

41:34.492 --> 41:37.203
You're the most important person
in my life,

41:39.038 --> 41:41.916
and I don't wanna lose you
because I'm an asshole.

41:45.794 --> 41:48.047
What you did for Salcedo was right,

41:49.548 --> 41:51.217
and those things I said were wrong.

41:54.553 --> 41:59.975
You walk the talk, and that's something
I struggle to do sometimes.

42:06.065 --> 42:07.650
But I love you for that,

42:09.360 --> 42:10.945
more than you know.

42:17.284 --> 42:19.662
Isabel, please...

42:20.746 --> 42:22.248
forgive me.

42:25.251 --> 42:26.293
Please.

42:35.803 --> 42:37.221
I'm so sorry.

42:39.723 --> 42:40.724
[sighs]

42:42.476 --> 42:45.646
This Crawford guy's username is "Krag."

42:45.729 --> 42:48.148
-Any idea what that means?
-No.

43:05.416 --> 43:08.794
It's an Afrikaans word
for power, strength or virtue.

43:09.295 --> 43:10.588
Hey, who the hell are you?

43:10.671 --> 43:11.755
Put the gun down, Crawford.

43:11.839 --> 43:12.798
How do you know my name?

43:12.881 --> 43:14.967
We got a photo of you
at the clinic in Toronto,

43:15.050 --> 43:16.969
and at the apartment complex in Tampa.

43:17.052 --> 43:18.262
I don't know what you're talking about.

43:18.345 --> 43:19.763
[Eli] If I may, I have a question.

43:19.847 --> 43:23.350
What's an aerospace engineer doing
fucking around with DNA

43:23.434 --> 43:24.560
and infecting people with the flu?

43:24.643 --> 43:26.353
You've got the wrong guy.

43:26.437 --> 43:29.565
Put your gun down.
Let's talk about how to help you.

43:29.648 --> 43:31.525
Help me? You haven't got a fucking clue.

43:32.818 --> 43:34.695
This is so much bigger than me.

43:35.863 --> 43:36.739
And you're not gonna stop--

43:38.240 --> 43:39.867
Shit! Hannah!

43:50.836 --> 43:52.129
Eighty-eight?

43:53.172 --> 43:54.798
It's a white supremacist symbol...

43:56.383 --> 43:57.926
for <i>"Heil </i>Hitler."

43:58.010 --> 44:00.638
H is the eighth letter of the alphabet.

44:03.974 --> 44:06.727
-Troy. You've been ignoring me for days.
-Keep your voice down.

44:06.810 --> 44:09.146
I'm not having this conversation
in the middle of the West Wing.

44:09.229 --> 44:10.272
In here.

44:12.316 --> 44:15.235
This is inappropriate on so many levels.

44:15.319 --> 44:18.572
I am sorry you feel like
I took something away from you.

44:18.656 --> 44:19.823
Or that I lied.

44:20.824 --> 44:23.911
But not speaking to me
isn't gonna solve anything.

44:23.994 --> 44:26.372
I just don't know how to deal with this.

44:26.455 --> 44:27.706
[door opens]

44:29.667 --> 44:30.959
I booked this room.

44:31.043 --> 44:32.586
Can you just give us a minute, Felix?

44:40.094 --> 44:44.973
I watched a lot of men die
growing up in Mississippi.

44:49.895 --> 44:51.355
They all looked like me.

44:53.524 --> 44:55.067
They talked like me.

44:56.777 --> 44:58.946
They loved like me.

45:07.371 --> 45:08.997
And they ended up with AIDS.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.919
I swore that would never be me.

45:15.504 --> 45:16.755
I get that.

45:18.799 --> 45:22.594
But I told you, I'm undetectable.

45:26.557 --> 45:29.977
It's actually safer to have sex
with someone who is undetectable

45:30.060 --> 45:32.729
than it is with someone
that hasn't really been tested recently.

45:37.818 --> 45:39.361
When's the last time you were tested?

45:40.028 --> 45:41.572
About a year ago.

45:41.655 --> 45:44.283
And how many people
have you hooked up with since then?

45:44.366 --> 45:46.869
I'm a top. The risk is different.

45:47.536 --> 45:50.247
The person I got it from was a top.

45:50.330 --> 45:52.875
-Yeah, well, I'm clean.
-And I'm dirty?

45:54.585 --> 45:57.129
Being positive doesn't mean I am immoral

45:57.212 --> 45:59.923
or that I'm being punished
for doing something wrong.

46:00.507 --> 46:01.717
Hey, tell me...

46:04.094 --> 46:06.805
you always wait until after
before you let a guy know?

46:07.848 --> 46:10.100
I waited because I liked you,

46:11.727 --> 46:14.438
and I was actually afraid
of being rejected.

46:15.022 --> 46:16.899
I just feel like I can't trust you.

46:19.443 --> 46:20.903
We can end this here.

46:23.864 --> 46:26.116
-Whatever this was.
-[door opens]

46:29.077 --> 46:30.078
Guys.

46:33.165 --> 46:34.958
The room's yours. We're done.

46:36.960 --> 46:38.086
Dontae.

46:41.590 --> 46:43.550
[Mars] Lynn? Lynn?

46:47.513 --> 46:51.600
Lynn? Lynn? Lynn, Lynn. Wake up.

46:51.683 --> 46:52.976
Lynn, wake up.

46:53.060 --> 46:54.561
Shit!

46:55.729 --> 46:57.397
-[line rings]
-[operator] <i>911.</i>

46:57.481 --> 46:59.149
I need an ambulance right away.

46:59.775 --> 47:03.237
My wife OD'd. 84 Barryville Street.

47:04.780 --> 47:07.157
Come on, Lynn. Stay here. Stay here.

47:12.329 --> 47:15.332
Penn, why are you looking at that stuff?
It's just gonna make you upset.

47:15.916 --> 47:17.793
Have you read
what they're saying about you?

47:18.919 --> 47:20.462
Yes, I have.

47:21.296 --> 47:23.465
-Why aren't you mad?
-I was, at first.

47:24.424 --> 47:25.926
And then I realized...

47:27.261 --> 47:29.263
getting mad wasn't gonna fix anything.

47:31.098 --> 47:32.975
Sadly, sometimes, being president means

47:33.058 --> 47:35.227
that people are gonna say
mean things about you...

47:35.978 --> 47:37.938
and about the people that you love.

47:39.189 --> 47:40.607
You know what makes me
feel better, though?

47:43.193 --> 47:44.528
I know the truth.

47:45.821 --> 47:49.658
I know how special Mommy was.
Sasha, Leo, you.

47:50.492 --> 47:52.703
And the truth is, I love you
more than anything in the world

47:52.786 --> 47:54.288
and that's all that matters.

47:55.956 --> 47:57.332
I love you, too.

48:00.794 --> 48:02.045
Book bag.

48:03.547 --> 48:06.008
I still don't know
how you carry that thing.

48:09.177 --> 48:10.929
[distorted voice over laptop]
<i>Tom Kirkman, mourning husband</i>

48:11.013 --> 48:13.307
<i>or murderous spouse? You be the judge.</i>

48:13.390 --> 48:16.685
Your voice-over is the icing on the cake.

48:17.185 --> 48:19.730
Ah, all it took was a little ingenuity

48:19.813 --> 48:21.898
-and electronic distortion.
-Yeah.

48:21.982 --> 48:24.943
Sure did the trick, though,
stirring up Kirkman sympathizers.

48:25.027 --> 48:28.822
Oh, yeah. I couldn't have said
"fuck you" to Moss any better

48:28.905 --> 48:31.742
if I'd painted it on the side
of Beyoncé's tour bus.

48:32.659 --> 48:34.661
I have something for you.

48:36.163 --> 48:38.498
There's a little extra in there
for diverting Dontae.

48:38.582 --> 48:43.128
Let me know if you need anything else.
Moss is paying me in nickels and dimes.

48:43.962 --> 48:45.547
I'll be in touch.

48:53.388 --> 48:55.265
Dianne talked to the FBI.

48:55.349 --> 48:57.351
Crawford was the leader of a new branch

48:57.434 --> 49:00.228
of the Rising Dawn movement
called "Reclaim Our Nation."

49:00.312 --> 49:02.064
He was recruiting young professionals.

49:02.147 --> 49:06.360
That's a new sick twist. Neo-Nazi PhDs.

49:06.443 --> 49:08.528
Another thing to keep me up all night.

49:08.612 --> 49:11.031
Yeah, well, apparently,
the FBI were tracking him

49:11.114 --> 49:12.574
since the alt-right rally in Missouri,

49:12.658 --> 49:14.409
but they didn't have anything
to charge him with.

49:14.493 --> 49:16.161
It's all starting to make sense.

49:16.995 --> 49:20.832
Tinkering with DNA
to make a designer ethnic bioweapon.

49:23.043 --> 49:23.960
Oh, shit.

49:24.544 --> 49:25.545
What?

49:25.629 --> 49:26.880
The birds.

49:29.091 --> 49:30.300
The cardinals.

49:31.343 --> 49:35.222
They killed them with the flu
using a virulent piece of smallpox,

49:35.305 --> 49:38.600
then they targeted people of color
and gave them the flu.

49:38.684 --> 49:40.352
If they put this all together,

49:41.103 --> 49:45.899
you and I
and a big part of the world are dead.

49:52.698 --> 49:54.700
[theme music playing]
