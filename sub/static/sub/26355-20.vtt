Lois's sister who was married
to Mayor West,

00:39.080 --> 00:41.665
- but now he's dead.
- Whoo, I love you, Carol!

00:41.666 --> 00:43.959
We're glad you could come over
for dinner tonight, Carol.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.711
Thank you for having me.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.213
I've been having such a hard
time since Adam passed away.

00:48.214 --> 00:50.507
- Aw...
- Whoo!

00:50.508 --> 00:52.676
I want to squeeze your butt
and then take your pants down

00:52.677 --> 00:53.969
and look at your butt!

00:53.970 --> 00:55.721
We still can't believe
he's gone.

00:55.722 --> 00:59.266
He was such a great mayor,
and a great uncle to the kids.

00:59.267 --> 01:01.643
Wait, Uncle Adam is dead?

01:01.644 --> 01:04.396
Yeesh. How many people
has this show killed?

01:04.397 --> 01:06.815
- Yeah, we're all gonna miss...
- Hey, don't touch me, man!

01:06.816 --> 01:08.942
I'm leaving. I know, I know
what I did. I'm leaving.

01:10.653 --> 01:12.529
Yeah, we're all gonna miss
Mayor West.

01:12.530 --> 01:15.949
You know what'll make you
feel better, Aunt Carol?

01:15.950 --> 01:17.242
Doing an Indian guy.

01:17.243 --> 01:19.244
Meg, stop eating with
the serving spoon.

01:19.245 --> 01:20.537
Nah.

01:20.538 --> 01:22.831
I just wish there was
some way we could honor

01:22.832 --> 01:25.042
Adam's memory here in town.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.293
You know what we should do?

01:26.294 --> 01:28.712
We should rename the high school
for Mayor West.

01:28.713 --> 01:30.756
What, you mean change it
from James Woods High?

01:30.757 --> 01:33.550
Yeah. James Woods
is an embarrassment to Quahog.

01:33.551 --> 01:36.220
He's a political troll
and a maniac on Twitter.

01:36.221 --> 01:37.638
I think that's a great idea,
Brian.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.473
You should meet
with Principal Shepherd

01:39.474 --> 01:40.390
and suggest it.

01:40.391 --> 01:41.892
Awesome. And while you do that,

01:41.893 --> 01:44.812
I'll make a special video
dedication reminding people

01:44.813 --> 01:47.189

Yes. To Adam West High.

02:40.202 --> 02:43.079
Well, you're a talking dog-- you
probably know what you're doing.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.247
Let's do it.

02:44.248 --> 02:46.207
Damn it!

02:46.208 --> 02:48.209
The only thing
that's left to do now

02:48.210 --> 02:52.255
is for you to pay the normal

What?! Wait a minute.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.675

02:55.676 --> 02:57.844
Me? I don't have

02:57.845 --> 03:00.096
Points! Just score points!

03:00.097 --> 03:02.182
I don't care who.

03:02.183 --> 03:04.517
Principal Shepherd,
someone named Eddie Payups

03:04.518 --> 03:06.019
is here to see you.

03:06.020 --> 03:07.270
Tell him I need one minute.

03:07.271 --> 03:09.314
Anyway, great idea.
We'll have a ceremony

03:09.315 --> 03:11.316
to change the name
of the school this week.

03:11.317 --> 03:13.443
What's the score
of that game right now?

03:13.444 --> 03:15.778
It's, uh, 85-75.

03:15.779 --> 03:18.448
Ugh! Not enough.

03:18.449 --> 03:19.449
Wow, we did it!

03:19.450 --> 03:20.867
We changed the name
of the school.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.119
Well, you know, it was
the right thing to do, Brian.

03:23.120 --> 03:26.289
Like when I had to give bad news
to that improv team.

03:26.290 --> 03:29.209
I called you here to tell you
that you're all 45 years old.

03:29.210 --> 03:31.420
Go home
and be with your children.

03:36.926 --> 03:38.468
Thank you, everybody,
for coming today

03:38.469 --> 03:40.845
as we honor one
of Quahog's finest citizens,

03:40.846 --> 03:42.597
Mayor Adam West.

03:42.598 --> 03:43.932
We will start today's ceremony

03:43.933 --> 03:46.226
with the traditional
21-cat launcher salute

03:46.227 --> 03:49.354
to honor our wacky
but beloved mayor.

03:49.355 --> 03:50.647
Ready! Aim!

03:50.648 --> 03:51.814
Meow!

03:53.150 --> 03:55.735
Beautiful.
Now, to unveil our new sign,

03:55.736 --> 03:58.530
we've invited HGTV's
Chip and Joanna Gaines,

03:58.531 --> 04:01.658
who are here to prove that their
show didn't ruin their marriage.

04:01.659 --> 04:05.245

to see your new sign?

04:05.246 --> 04:06.955
Yeah!

Oh, a-are we going that way?

04:09.416 --> 04:12.710

Do you need me
to walk you to your car

04:57.298 --> 04:59.340
in case the studio audience guy
shows up?

04:59.341 --> 05:02.051
No, he killed himself
in my downstairs shower.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.761
Oh, good. That's good.

05:03.762 --> 05:07.098
I just wanted to thank you
for what you did today for Adam.

05:07.099 --> 05:08.766
He was a great man.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.894
You know,
I see a lot of him in you.

05:10.895 --> 05:12.604
Oh, no.
Are we gonna kiss?

05:12.605 --> 05:15.023
- We're gonna kiss, aren't we?
- I came here to say

05:15.024 --> 05:17.025
that what you did was
very honorable.

05:17.026 --> 05:18.443
It showed real leadership,

05:18.444 --> 05:21.529
and I think <i> you</i> should be
the next mayor of Quahog.

05:21.530 --> 05:22.947
Ah, damn it!

05:22.948 --> 05:24.115
Oh, I couldn't do that.

05:24.116 --> 05:25.950
I don't know anything
about politics.

05:25.951 --> 05:28.286
Although, crazier things
have happened.

05:28.287 --> 05:30.371
Harry Truman didn't have
any experience.

05:30.372 --> 05:32.248
Of course he did.
He was vice president,

05:32.249 --> 05:35.001
and before that,
a United States senator.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.337
Oh, word?

05:37.338 --> 05:40.089
Brian, is this gonna be
a politics episode?

05:40.090 --> 05:41.841
I-I think it might be.

05:49.933 --> 05:52.436
No one likes those.

05:56.315 --> 05:59.275
So, Carol was just going on and
on about how I should be mayor.

05:59.276 --> 06:02.278
And it's got me thinking,
it <i> is</i> an interesting idea.

06:02.279 --> 06:04.238
- You think I should do it?
- Absolutely not.

06:04.239 --> 06:06.282
- I mean, if not me, who?
- Anyone.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.076
- If not now, when?
- Never.

06:08.077 --> 06:10.286
- You know, why <i> not</i> me?
- A million reasons.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.747
I mean, who do you want in
there, some career politician?

06:12.748 --> 06:14.374
- Yes.
- What are <i> they</i> gonna do?

06:14.375 --> 06:16.292
-Govern.
-Thanks, Stewie.
Your support means a lot.

06:16.293 --> 06:19.128
- You don't have it.
- You know what? I'm gonna do it.

06:19.129 --> 06:21.047
Guys, I have an announcement.

06:21.048 --> 06:24.384
- I'm gonna run for mayor.
- That's a terrible idea.

06:24.385 --> 06:26.969
You idiot, Brian.
Meg, fart on Brian.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.430
I can't.
I don't have one in the chamber.

a chance, you're not ready.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.477
Chris, tag in for Meg.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.314
See that kid?
He's a gamer.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.983
Great job, Chris.
Now, go hit the showers.

06:40.984 --> 06:43.486
Meg, you miss 100%
of the farts you don't take.

He's going all the way.

for a new segment on our show
called "On the Same Sofa,"

07:14.143 --> 07:16.394
in which a guest and I
have a conversation

07:16.395 --> 07:18.229
while sitting on the same sofa.

07:18.230 --> 07:21.149
My guest tonight is mayoral
candidate Brian Griffin.

07:21.150 --> 07:23.401
- Thank you for coming, Brian.
- Pleasure, Tom.

07:23.402 --> 07:25.570
And thank you for allowing me
up on the furniture.

07:25.571 --> 07:27.864
- I don't always get to do that.
- Oh, word?

07:27.865 --> 07:30.366
Now, I understand
you're running unopposed.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.910
That gives you a bit
of an advantage, doesn't it?

07:32.911 --> 07:35.121
Well, Tom,
I welcome a challenger.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.540
Not the one that exploded,
but, um...

07:37.541 --> 07:40.376
That's probably gonna get me
in trouble right there.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.378
Good thing
I'm running unopposed.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.422
Well, we've now reached
the middle of the interview,

07:44.423 --> 07:46.966
where I ask the guest,
"How's the sofa so far?"

07:46.967 --> 07:49.135
So, Brian,
how's the sofa so far?

07:49.136 --> 07:50.470
So far, so-so.

07:50.471 --> 07:51.512
I see. Sophie?

07:51.513 --> 07:53.347
So far we've got a so-so sofa.

07:53.348 --> 07:56.017
Great. Okay, Tom,
we go live in three,

07:56.018 --> 07:58.102
- two...
- What? None of that aired?

07:58.103 --> 08:00.062
It's all right,
we can recreate it.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.481
And you're on.

08:01.482 --> 08:04.150
So, Brian, I understand
you like eating your own poop.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.818
What's <i> that</i> about?

08:05.819 --> 08:07.195
Yech. Turn that off.

08:07.196 --> 08:09.405
I can't believe we're
gonna have a dog for mayor.

08:09.406 --> 08:11.407
We're gonna be the laughingstock
of the whole country.

08:11.408 --> 08:13.242
Even Sean Hannity's
talking about us.

08:13.243 --> 08:14.619
He's a weird-looking guy.

08:14.620 --> 08:17.413
-Put up a picture
of Sean Hannity.
-Can we do that?

08:17.414 --> 08:19.624
Yeah, Tosh does it
all the time. Put it up.

08:19.625 --> 08:21.292
Yeah, he does look weird.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.543
Yeah. Who does he look like?

08:22.544 --> 08:24.378
I'm seeing Mr. Doubtfire.

08:24.379 --> 08:26.255
High-sodium Superman?

08:26.256 --> 08:28.466
He looks like an angry face
drawn on a thumb.

08:28.467 --> 08:30.259
The richest guy at Rite Aid?

08:30.260 --> 08:32.053
Or the mayor who won't close

08:32.054 --> 08:33.346
the beaches in <i> Jaws.</i>

08:33.347 --> 08:35.014
Wreck-It Ralph
at a job interview.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.515
You know that's a guy

08:36.517 --> 08:38.893
who's roughly led his wife
out of parties by the elbow.

08:38.894 --> 08:41.312
A guy whose ice cream parlor
just went broke.

08:41.313 --> 08:42.980
He looks like a handsome Weeble.

08:42.981 --> 08:44.649
Or a hot Frankenstein.

08:44.650 --> 08:46.734
Yeah, but either way,
he's that Little League coach

08:46.735 --> 08:48.569
the parents hope
their kids don't get.

08:48.570 --> 08:51.364
He looks like a fish that
inflates to scare predators.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.407
The inside trader
who kills himself

08:53.408 --> 08:55.701
the day his prison sentence
is supposed to start.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.870
I'm thinking
Fred and Barney's son.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.414
- Trust me on this.
- Strip club lunch regular.

09:00.415 --> 09:01.999
I feel like that's a dad

09:02.000 --> 09:03.751
who's ripped his kid's posters
off the wall.

09:03.752 --> 09:06.462
And sleeps in pajamas
buttoned to the top.

09:06.463 --> 09:08.673
72-ounce steak contest entrant.

09:08.674 --> 09:11.634
Drowned-in-the-lake-

Hey, let's do Matthew Perry.
I'll start.

09:15.264 --> 09:16.472
He looks like a pelican

09:16.473 --> 09:18.516
trying to swallow
a fish that's too big.

09:18.517 --> 09:20.476
Barn owl in human skin.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.436
He looks like he told a genie

09:22.437 --> 09:25.398
- he wished to be a pool noodle.

11:31.233 --> 11:32.858
My opponent's economic plan.

11:32.859 --> 11:35.695
It's irresponsible for the town
to get two credit cards

11:35.696 --> 11:38.322
and just swap the balance
back and forth each month.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.491
But, but the town
would get miles.

11:40.492 --> 11:43.035

the folder whatever I want?

"Tom's Stuff."

12:01.638 --> 12:02.805
Good question, Tom.

12:02.806 --> 12:06.350
And I'll answer that
with one word: pizza!

12:08.437 --> 12:10.146
Damn it, he burned me twice.

And sometimes it's, like,
kids making the pancakes,

16:33.159 --> 16:35.160
and-and you get
these mondo huge ones.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.662
Wow.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.831
Probably no
chocolate chip pancakes, though.

65 a year, you're gonna get

chocolate chip pancake events.

16:43.545 --> 16:45.254
- You think eight to ten?
- Yes.

16:45.255 --> 16:47.965
And now that I say it out loud,
eight to ten sounds low.
