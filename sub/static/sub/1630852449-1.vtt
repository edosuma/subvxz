00:16.541 --> 00:18.458
<i>My brother, Joseph, always said,</i>

00:19.166 --> 00:24.541
<i>without them, we are just some village</i>
<i>somewhere in the mountains of Tyrol.</i>

00:25.958 --> 00:26.875
<i>But with them,</i>

00:27.625 --> 00:28.958
<i>we are Kitzbühel,</i>

00:29.833 --> 00:31.166
<i>the Aspen of the Alps.</i>

00:34.708 --> 00:36.458
<i>They invade every winter.</i>

00:38.125 --> 00:42.916
<i>They drive to their alpine-chic chalets</i>
<i>up there where the fat cats live.</i>

00:43.791 --> 00:45.625
<i>They bring glamour, money</i>,

00:47.041 --> 00:48.000
<i>and parties.</i>

00:49.791 --> 00:51.791
<i>But behind their sparkling facade,</i>

00:52.500 --> 00:54.166
<i>they are just people</i>

00:55.041 --> 00:56.875
<i>like you and me.</i>

00:58.708 --> 01:01.083
<i>At least, that's</i>
<i>what my brother Joseph always said.</i>

01:03.958 --> 01:05.208
Lisi, you were right.

01:05.708 --> 01:08.458
She's just fucking manipulative.

01:10.666 --> 01:12.666
I really thought she loved me.

01:13.666 --> 01:15.791
And she was just jerking me around.

01:30.875 --> 01:33.500
<i>I wanted her to feel what it means</i>

01:33.583 --> 01:36.583
<i>to lose everything in one night.</i>

01:39.458 --> 01:40.791
<i>I wanted to show her</i>

01:41.291 --> 01:43.708
<i>that even her actions have consequences.</i>

01:49.041 --> 01:50.041
<i>But this…</i>

01:52.375 --> 01:53.875
<i>This isn't what I wanted.</i>

02:11.916 --> 02:12.958
Hey, Lisi.

02:13.625 --> 02:15.125
Your drink will be ready soon.

02:15.208 --> 02:16.791
What do you want?

02:16.875 --> 02:19.041
Here you go. Cheers, <i>mon chéri.</i>

02:19.125 --> 02:20.125
Thank you, Lisi.

02:20.875 --> 02:24.166
Don't drink it too quickly, Hubert,
or else you'll miss the fireworks.

02:24.250 --> 02:26.458
You can't pay with your Visa here.

02:26.541 --> 02:29.000
-What do you want?
-We got here first!

02:29.083 --> 02:31.416
-Hop in your SUV and go back to Munich!
-Stop!

02:31.500 --> 02:32.791
You have a choice.

02:33.333 --> 02:35.791
Either you go outside
and beat each other up,

02:35.875 --> 02:37.875
or you drink with me,

02:38.750 --> 02:41.208
and we drink to a peaceful new year.

02:45.791 --> 02:48.166
-Agreed.
-Thanks, Lisi.

02:48.791 --> 02:50.166
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

02:50.250 --> 02:51.291
Cheers.

02:53.500 --> 02:54.875
Let's go, two games.

02:57.791 --> 02:59.041
Okay, I'm here now.

02:59.833 --> 03:02.708
-Do you know tonight's hostess yet?
-Show me.

03:02.791 --> 03:05.458
<i>Hey, lovelies. I'm on my way to Kitzbühel,</i>

03:05.541 --> 03:08.583
<i>and I'm preparing</i>
<i>the most epic party of the year.</i>

03:08.666 --> 03:11.083
<i>What can't you skip</i>
<i>before such a long night?</i>

03:11.166 --> 03:12.875
<i>The perfect beauty routine.</i>

03:12.958 --> 03:15.625
<i>I'm currently testing</i>
<i>products from Pure Aura.</i>

03:15.708 --> 03:18.375
<i>I swear by the Pure Aura moisture mask.</i>

03:18.958 --> 03:21.208
"Pure Aura"? I'll have some of that!

03:21.291 --> 03:23.375
I'm sure an aura like that will cost you.

03:24.333 --> 03:27.875
-How's tonight looking?
-Taken care of. I talked to Madli.

03:27.958 --> 03:30.083
And I even have your outfit.

03:31.583 --> 03:33.625
Are we working or joining a cult?

03:38.750 --> 03:41.375
Are you sure
you want to do this to yourself?

03:42.041 --> 03:44.166
It's high season.
I'll take what I can get.

03:46.166 --> 03:47.416
But today of all days?

03:48.333 --> 03:50.166
Just tell me about London.

03:51.166 --> 03:53.625
Lots of rain,
no mountains, crazy expensive.

03:54.708 --> 03:56.791
Admit it, you're having a great time.

03:57.375 --> 03:59.708
Fine, then. The city is fucking insane.

03:59.791 --> 04:01.458
You absolutely have to come.

04:05.583 --> 04:08.750
But first, I'll see you
at the "most epic party of the year."

04:08.833 --> 04:10.416
Oh my God. Yes.

04:28.666 --> 04:31.583
You're leaving already? I could go again.

04:32.250 --> 04:34.083
-I have to work.
-Dude!

04:34.708 --> 04:37.041
It's New Year's Eve and you want to work?

04:37.125 --> 04:38.625
I don't want to. I have to.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.625
-What do you do, actually?
-Why?

04:41.708 --> 04:45.833
Well, it's your third time here,
and I don't even know your name.

04:45.916 --> 04:48.958
Unless "Anonymous Fun"
is a typical name in Tyrol.

04:52.875 --> 04:54.833
Not a fan of small talk. Got it.

04:56.416 --> 04:59.750
Sure you can't party with us tonight?
It's going to be epic.

04:59.833 --> 05:00.666
I'M STILL OUT.

05:00.750 --> 05:02.458
-I have to get to the farm.
-Hold on.

05:02.541 --> 05:03.375
BE RIGHT THERE!

05:03.458 --> 05:04.416
"To the farm", you said?

05:05.750 --> 05:06.791
That's a clue.

05:10.500 --> 05:11.333
You're a

05:12.250 --> 05:13.166
farmer.

05:14.625 --> 05:15.625
For real?

05:16.708 --> 05:18.000
An actual farmer?

05:18.500 --> 05:22.541
With a tractor, pitchforks,
and you milk cows and all that shit?

05:23.833 --> 05:24.958
More or less.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.458
Never been with a farmer before.

05:31.000 --> 05:31.833
Congrats.

05:32.791 --> 05:35.083
I'll go milk the cows, then.

05:35.833 --> 05:38.041
Don't they basically do it on their own?

05:38.666 --> 05:40.333
We don't have a milking robot.

05:41.541 --> 05:43.291
That makes things tough.

05:45.750 --> 05:46.958
Who is that?

05:47.041 --> 05:48.625
Just the cleaning robot.

05:49.833 --> 05:51.416
I'll be here a few more days

05:51.500 --> 05:54.166
if you're in the mood
for more "anonymous fun."

06:00.000 --> 06:00.958
Happy New Year!

06:56.541 --> 06:57.833
To London, baby!

06:57.916 --> 07:00.541
To Saint Martins College
of Art and fucking Design!

07:00.625 --> 07:02.125
I'm so proud of you.

07:03.291 --> 07:05.875
Keep it down for a second, please!

07:09.750 --> 07:12.333
My sister here, the little genius,

07:13.916 --> 07:16.875
got a scholarship to London!

07:20.291 --> 07:23.166
Which means she's done serving you here!

07:25.250 --> 07:27.500
That's why the next round will be on Lisi!

07:30.708 --> 07:32.041
-Lisi!
-Lisi!

07:32.125 --> 07:33.458
Okay.

07:34.833 --> 07:35.833
Moscow mule,

07:36.833 --> 07:39.333
Cuba libre, and Dark 'n' Stormy!

07:40.041 --> 07:40.875
Jo?

07:41.708 --> 07:42.958
Dark 'n' Stormy?

07:44.000 --> 07:45.625
No, I'm good. Thanks.

07:46.833 --> 07:47.791
What?

07:48.375 --> 07:49.583
I'm heading out.

07:49.666 --> 07:51.333
But we wanted to celebrate.

07:51.416 --> 07:53.458
No, I have to go. Sorry.

07:53.541 --> 07:54.875
Where are you going?

07:54.958 --> 07:57.333
Probably to his mystery girl. Right, Jo?

07:58.375 --> 08:01.041
Who is it this time, Jo?
Becky from Australia?

08:01.125 --> 08:02.750
Or Francesca from Bologna?

08:02.833 --> 08:04.541
Or maybe she has a boyfriend.

08:04.625 --> 08:05.916
Yeah, she has boyfriend.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
Not anymore. She broke up with him.

08:10.333 --> 08:11.750
See you at the bonfire.

08:17.958 --> 08:18.875
Hey, Hans.

08:32.458 --> 08:33.333
How are you?

08:34.583 --> 08:35.916
It's tough today.

08:39.208 --> 08:40.500
You know what's crazy?

08:42.166 --> 08:44.583
I keep looking over there and wondering,

08:46.208 --> 08:48.583
"Did she even notice that he died?"

08:52.208 --> 08:53.041
Lisi?

08:54.791 --> 08:57.208
Are you sure we're doing the right thing?

08:58.708 --> 08:59.541
Hey.

09:09.625 --> 09:10.541
We will do it.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.041
For his sake.

09:20.958 --> 09:22.208
<i>One year to the day…</i>

09:23.916 --> 09:25.833
<i>the day the world shattered.</i>

09:33.833 --> 09:34.958
<i>A year of stasis,</i>

09:36.041 --> 09:36.916
<i>emptiness</i>,

09:37.875 --> 09:38.875
<i>powerlessness.</i>

09:42.416 --> 09:43.750
<i>A year of waiting</i>.

09:45.041 --> 09:45.875
<i>For today.</i>

09:50.041 --> 09:53.500
<i>For the moment when you retake control.</i>

09:55.416 --> 09:57.291
<i>The moment there's no going back.</i>

09:57.375 --> 10:01.958
PRIVATE PROPERTY

10:07.000 --> 10:09.583
<i>You pause and make yourself aware.</i>

10:11.750 --> 10:13.708
<i>If you want to go through with this,</i>

10:15.708 --> 10:17.958
<i>you can't let yourself get distracted.</i>

10:29.833 --> 10:31.666
Sorry, I'm looking for the caterers.

10:33.208 --> 10:34.041
Around back.

10:38.416 --> 10:39.541
Dominik, right?

10:42.375 --> 10:44.833
-Do I know you?
-You're her boyfriend.

10:45.458 --> 10:47.166
Are you one of her followers?

10:48.916 --> 10:49.958
Exactly.

10:51.416 --> 10:53.083
How was California?

10:55.958 --> 10:56.791
Warmer.

10:57.916 --> 11:00.833
I just left the sauna, so…

11:03.708 --> 11:05.458
Could you toss me the towel?

11:05.541 --> 11:06.375
Lisi?

11:09.208 --> 11:10.333
Work calls.

11:10.416 --> 11:12.291
Okay, so…

11:12.375 --> 11:13.416
Ciao?

11:24.875 --> 11:27.416
The aperitif is a<i> Pét Nat</i>,

11:27.916 --> 11:30.958
organic and made
using traditional methods.

11:31.458 --> 11:34.500
No sulfates
but a really nice and dirty aftertaste.

11:34.583 --> 11:36.708
Hey, Lisi? Got it?

11:37.583 --> 11:39.291
Nice and dirty. Yeah.

11:39.375 --> 11:42.416
Great. Take the champagne
to the hostess' room. Move it!

11:51.500 --> 11:52.333
Hello?

13:20.708 --> 13:21.541
And?

13:22.583 --> 13:23.416
You get lost?

13:25.083 --> 13:26.833
Just bringing the drinks up.

13:27.375 --> 13:29.416
Why were you on the balcony?

13:31.125 --> 13:33.375
-Just airing out the--
-Fascinating.

13:33.458 --> 13:35.333
I don't need all the details.

13:37.083 --> 13:37.916
You can go.

13:47.875 --> 13:51.583
Wirsing! What's the word
on the gifts for the empress?

13:51.666 --> 13:52.541
<i>On it!</i>

13:52.625 --> 13:54.041
Don't leave me hanging.

13:54.125 --> 13:57.125
<i>You sure Vanessa is fine</i>
<i>with me showing up at her party?</i>

13:57.208 --> 13:59.166
Wirsing, where's your confidence?

13:59.250 --> 14:02.083
Nessa is my best friend,
and you're my plus one.

14:02.625 --> 14:06.500
<i>-Are you up there yet?</i>
-Had to get a quick whiff of village air.

14:06.583 --> 14:08.708
Almost there. Party, party!

14:12.541 --> 14:14.333
Feels good to be here again.

14:38.208 --> 14:41.333
-"The one-stop shop for bereavements?"
-Right. Catchy.

14:41.916 --> 14:43.500
-How's it going?
-Yeah.

14:43.583 --> 14:47.500
We're listed
on <i>Forbes Germany's</i> "30 under 30."

14:47.583 --> 14:50.208
-Wow.
-How's your car designing going?

14:51.041 --> 14:52.833
-Good. Really good.
-Yeah.

14:52.916 --> 14:54.875
So they took you on in Pasadena?

14:57.583 --> 14:59.000
-Be right back.
-Yeah.

15:01.958 --> 15:03.791
Thanks, you're my savior.

15:04.791 --> 15:06.833
Something's different about you.

15:08.500 --> 15:09.583
But what?

15:10.458 --> 15:12.250
I found something to wear.

15:13.208 --> 15:14.500
It's a nice look.

15:15.875 --> 15:18.416
No hitting on the staff, Domi!

15:18.500 --> 15:19.750
Kosh!

15:21.166 --> 15:22.000
Hey!

15:23.041 --> 15:24.083
How's it going?

15:24.166 --> 15:25.333
Where's Nessa?

15:25.416 --> 15:28.791
It's very important to show up late,
even at your own party.

15:28.875 --> 15:31.333
I scored some good stuff for us three.

15:31.416 --> 15:33.375
Wirsing is here somewhere. You seen him?

15:33.458 --> 15:35.583
Wirsing? Why Wirsing?

15:35.666 --> 15:37.750
-He's bringing the stuff.
-No.

15:37.833 --> 15:39.750
No Wirsing. Nessa will flip out.

15:39.833 --> 15:40.833
Why not?

15:40.916 --> 15:42.791
Just make sure he leaves.

15:42.875 --> 15:44.708
Come on, we're partying tonight.

15:44.791 --> 15:47.333
I haven't seen you in a year, man!

15:48.375 --> 15:49.625
It hasn't been a year.

15:54.250 --> 15:55.375
Has it been a year?

16:14.833 --> 16:18.208
My lovelies,
a year is simply way too long.

16:18.291 --> 16:20.708
I'm super happy to be back in Kitzbühel.

16:26.333 --> 16:29.375
It's all taken care of.
You know the drill.

16:35.333 --> 16:37.375
Yeah!

16:39.958 --> 16:42.625
-Come here, you bombshell!
-Kosh!

16:44.666 --> 16:45.500
Hey, babe.

16:46.208 --> 16:47.958
Is the band back together or what?

16:48.041 --> 16:51.125
Pipps, this is Kosh,
an old friend from way back.

16:51.708 --> 16:54.000
-You still know each other?
-"From way back?"

16:54.083 --> 16:55.500
Kosh! Crazy!

16:55.583 --> 16:58.208
You look totally different. You were…

16:58.291 --> 16:59.166
Fat like a pig?

17:00.625 --> 17:04.458
<i>Comare</i>, I brought us mezcal.
8,000 a bottle.

17:04.541 --> 17:06.250
Maybe later. I'm going to mingle.

17:06.333 --> 17:08.833
No way! We're drinking. Pass me your cups.

17:08.916 --> 17:12.125
I need to say hi to some people,
but I'm glad you came.

17:15.500 --> 17:18.041
"From way back?" Is she ashamed of me?

17:18.125 --> 17:19.750
Nonsense. Forget it. Come.

17:20.833 --> 17:23.125
What's that supposed to mean,
"From way back?"

17:23.208 --> 17:24.416
Ancient history?

17:24.500 --> 17:26.708
-I feel as if I've gone extinct.
-Hey.

17:27.416 --> 17:31.208
-No Kitzbühel meltdown today.
-Meltdown, schmeltdown!

17:34.333 --> 17:35.333
No offense…

17:37.291 --> 17:38.125
Dude!

17:39.666 --> 17:40.500
Come on.

17:40.583 --> 17:43.208
Let's all get trashed.
You get a drink too.

17:43.291 --> 17:44.250
Domi! Come here.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
Guys, duty calls.

17:59.250 --> 18:00.083
<i>Come on.</i>

18:00.166 --> 18:03.541
<i>Don't drive to see her.</i>
<i>It's almost midnight.</i>

18:05.166 --> 18:08.000
-You can't just leave.
-I'll see you tomorrow anyway.

18:08.083 --> 18:09.166
Calm down.

18:10.375 --> 18:13.791
It's all icy and foggy out there!
Plus, you've been drinking.

18:13.875 --> 18:15.833
A few sips. I'm stone-cold sober.

18:15.916 --> 18:16.750
Hey, Jo.

18:17.583 --> 18:18.416
Just stay.

18:19.458 --> 18:20.875
Don't be dumb. Stay.

18:20.958 --> 18:23.666
I'll see you in the new year.
Don't be mad.

18:25.500 --> 18:26.791
He's tired of life.

18:26.875 --> 18:28.375
No, he's in love.

18:29.458 --> 18:33.916
Five, four, three, two, one…

19:04.333 --> 19:05.583
Happy New Year, love.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.083
Is everything okay?

19:10.833 --> 19:11.750
Happy New Year.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
I have one wish for the new year.

19:17.791 --> 19:19.666
For you to come with me to London.

19:20.333 --> 19:21.333
Like we planned.

19:23.208 --> 19:24.583
But how, Antonia?

19:25.333 --> 19:28.375
I don't know.
Just apply to Saint Martins again.

19:28.458 --> 19:29.833
You were practically in.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.666
I can't leave my parents here alone.

19:35.541 --> 19:36.791
I know your dad.

19:36.875 --> 19:39.791
I don't think
they'd want you to sacrifice your future.

19:44.416 --> 19:46.291
You weren't here last year.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.166
Fuck it, let's do three.

20:05.083 --> 20:06.833
A little ketamine for later?

20:08.208 --> 20:09.208
Absolutely!

20:13.375 --> 20:14.208
Kosh?

20:15.958 --> 20:18.208
-Right on time!
-What's he doing here?

20:18.291 --> 20:19.583
Hi, Domi.

20:19.666 --> 20:21.625
I told you I don't want him here.

20:21.708 --> 20:24.958
Why are you being so mean to Wirsing?

20:25.041 --> 20:27.000
Seriously, I'm a person too.

20:27.083 --> 20:29.666
Sorry if I hurt your feelings.

20:30.416 --> 20:32.208
Now beat it!

20:38.958 --> 20:41.083
-Should I go too?
-Cut it out.

20:45.041 --> 20:47.500
Sorry we haven't spoken much
this past year.

20:48.708 --> 20:50.416
Things were a bit hectic.

20:55.541 --> 20:56.666
Is everything okay?

21:01.791 --> 21:04.000
It's all good. All good.

21:05.416 --> 21:06.416
All right, then.

21:08.416 --> 21:09.541
Let's have a dip.

21:10.125 --> 21:14.458
I'M STILL WAITING FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT.

21:20.625 --> 21:22.291
Wait, we'll be alone soon.

21:28.000 --> 21:31.458
Let's go! Whip it out and jerk it off.

21:36.250 --> 21:37.916
God, you're so pathetic.

21:44.833 --> 21:47.750
Just like that, you dirty, little pig.

21:49.041 --> 21:51.000
I want to hear you come, Ferdinand.

21:52.583 --> 21:55.500
Keep going. So close.

21:58.041 --> 22:00.166
You did very well.

22:01.083 --> 22:03.916
Now go back to your wife like a good boy.

22:04.916 --> 22:06.916
-And think about me.
<i>-Yes, I will.</i>

22:19.500 --> 22:20.333
Hello?

22:22.333 --> 22:23.333
Hello?

22:29.750 --> 22:32.000
-What are you doing here?
-Bathroom.

22:32.083 --> 22:33.625
This one's not for staff.

22:35.500 --> 22:36.500
What's your name?

22:38.000 --> 22:38.916
Your name?

22:40.500 --> 22:41.333
Lisi.

22:42.250 --> 22:43.166
Why?

22:43.250 --> 22:44.083
Cute.

22:44.625 --> 22:47.500
Go back to your friends in the village.
You're fired.

22:49.291 --> 22:52.083
-You can't fire me.
-Sure I can.

22:52.166 --> 22:54.416
I'm the hostess' best friend.

22:54.500 --> 22:55.500
I didn't do anything.

22:55.583 --> 22:59.083
That's what you say,
but you were snooping around, and…

23:02.458 --> 23:05.166
I saw a few things slip into your pocket.

23:06.833 --> 23:09.000
-But--
-Pack your bags, Heidi.

23:10.791 --> 23:13.750
Go on now.
Or do you want to hear me taking a shit?

24:01.666 --> 24:02.750
What the fuck?

24:04.916 --> 24:06.625
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

24:12.250 --> 24:14.916
-I'm sorry! I--
-Stop, you're making it worse.

24:16.583 --> 24:18.541
How hard is it to carry a fucking tray?

24:18.625 --> 24:20.000
What happened here?

24:20.083 --> 24:22.083
Where did you get these fucking amateurs?

24:24.791 --> 24:26.000
The whole outfit's ruined.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.541
I'll go change.

24:52.208 --> 24:54.291
Why are you doing this to yourself?

24:54.375 --> 24:57.291
-I'll be right back in.
-Just go home.

24:57.375 --> 24:59.541
I'll deal with Madli.
Don't worry about it.

24:59.625 --> 25:01.583
I'll call you tomorrow.

25:04.750 --> 25:05.875
What are you doing?

25:07.250 --> 25:08.333
Apologizing.

25:08.416 --> 25:10.166
Go on now. Fuck them.

25:11.375 --> 25:12.916
I can't afford to do that.

25:43.041 --> 25:44.291
Close the fucking door!

25:46.125 --> 25:47.916
Lock it.

25:48.000 --> 25:48.875
Faster!

25:49.583 --> 25:51.750
Get over there. Over there.

25:52.666 --> 25:54.208
Shut up! Both of you!

25:54.291 --> 25:56.333
Shit! Don't look at me!

26:10.250 --> 26:11.083
Nessa?

26:14.166 --> 26:15.791
Say something!

26:17.583 --> 26:18.916
I'll be right there.

26:21.833 --> 26:23.041
Can I come in?

26:23.541 --> 26:25.750
Not now. I'll be right there.

26:25.833 --> 26:27.000
Okay…

26:28.208 --> 26:29.416
See you downstairs.

26:35.041 --> 26:38.291
Don't worry, the police will be here soon.

26:38.375 --> 26:40.291
-What did you say?
-Nothing.

26:40.375 --> 26:41.333
What did you say?

26:42.625 --> 26:45.875
Tell me what you said. Say it now.

26:48.833 --> 26:52.166
-The police will be here any minute.
-Don't lie to me.

26:53.166 --> 26:54.708
I just called them.

26:54.791 --> 26:57.708
-Before you found me.
-You're lying.

26:58.958 --> 26:59.791
If you say so.

27:01.625 --> 27:04.625
If I were you,
I'd leave as fast as I could.

27:08.416 --> 27:10.166
Shut your fucking mouth!

27:21.500 --> 27:22.333
Okay.

27:23.583 --> 27:24.500
It's all over.

27:26.166 --> 27:28.458
It's okay.

27:29.250 --> 27:30.250
-Okay?
-Okay.

27:31.708 --> 27:32.958
Nessa?

27:33.041 --> 27:35.541
Honey, open up. Come on!

27:35.625 --> 27:36.833
Nessa!

27:42.000 --> 27:44.583
Oh my God. I heard about your dress.

27:49.958 --> 27:51.333
What's she doing here?

27:52.583 --> 27:55.125
She just saved my fucking life.

27:55.208 --> 27:56.791
Call the police right now.

28:00.583 --> 28:03.625
-Is this the door he came through?
-Yes.

28:04.250 --> 28:07.500
I had just changed, and he just walked in.

28:07.583 --> 28:09.916
Otherwise you're okay, Ms. von Höhenfeldt?

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
She was threatened with a gun.

28:12.625 --> 28:14.083
How do you think she feels?

28:14.708 --> 28:17.666
-We're done here.
-Baroness von Höhenfeldt.

28:18.166 --> 28:20.416
-Thank you. Goodbye.
-Ciao.

28:25.916 --> 28:26.791
Lisi.

28:28.333 --> 28:29.750
Tell your parents I said hi.

28:35.083 --> 28:36.208
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
I will.

28:56.500 --> 28:57.333
Thank you.

29:00.708 --> 29:05.000
That's enough cuddling.
Get on the dance floor, party animals!

29:05.625 --> 29:06.958
I still have to work.

29:08.250 --> 29:10.250
<i>You </i>are partying with us.

29:10.750 --> 29:11.583
Come on.

30:39.041 --> 30:42.458
-Sorry again about your outfit.
-Who gives a shit?

30:42.541 --> 30:44.666
You're the fucking hero tonight!

30:50.291 --> 30:53.333
-How much longer will you be in Kitzbühel?
-A few days.

30:53.916 --> 30:56.208
But we're having
brunch tomorrow at Dominik's.

30:56.291 --> 30:58.000
Just a few people. Just swing by.

30:59.333 --> 31:00.291
I'd love to.

31:02.125 --> 31:03.583
It'll be awesome! Yeah.

31:11.541 --> 31:13.625
Hey, could you get us some drinks?

31:14.250 --> 31:16.250
What? I'm not--

31:17.041 --> 31:18.916
This time, you won't drop the tray.

31:19.958 --> 31:20.916
Nessa!

31:22.000 --> 31:23.333
Don't mess with her.

31:23.416 --> 31:26.458
She'll give you anorexia
if you don't follow her orders.

31:26.541 --> 31:27.416
Are you okay?

31:28.375 --> 31:30.291
Why is everyone asking me that?

31:42.541 --> 31:45.375
Pippa, what a funny name. Pippa.

31:45.875 --> 31:46.916
Pippa.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.500
Pippa!

31:52.791 --> 31:55.500
Kosh. Dial it back a notch.

31:56.041 --> 31:56.958
Party!

32:22.083 --> 32:22.916
Hey.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.041
You heading out?

32:30.250 --> 32:32.250
I think I'm all out of gas.

32:35.083 --> 32:36.291
Quite a performance.

32:38.083 --> 32:39.916
I guess you could call it that.

32:45.708 --> 32:48.291
That's all I have on me. I can PayPal you.

32:49.083 --> 32:49.916
What?

32:51.250 --> 32:52.250
To say thank you.

32:53.458 --> 32:55.375
You think I came here for a tip?

32:58.625 --> 33:00.333
You think I'm a Munich fat cat

33:00.416 --> 33:03.333
who throws money around and sprays
Dom Pérignon all over the place?

33:06.583 --> 33:08.250
But you're deeper, right?

33:10.083 --> 33:14.333
That's why you're sitting here,
gazing at the mountains and wondering,

33:16.625 --> 33:19.250
"What if I'm not the center
of the universe?"

33:22.583 --> 33:24.958
Seems you've made up your mind about me.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.416
A word of advice,

33:27.500 --> 33:30.458
before you give someone 100 euros<i>,</i>

33:30.541 --> 33:32.166
ask their name first.

33:40.583 --> 33:41.416
Okay.

33:46.291 --> 33:47.333
What's your name?

33:50.958 --> 33:51.791
Lisi.

33:55.958 --> 33:56.791
Dominik,

33:58.041 --> 33:59.500
center of the universe.

34:10.083 --> 34:11.083
Okay, then.

34:12.833 --> 34:14.458
See you soon, Lisi.

34:47.541 --> 34:48.583
Not a word.

34:53.875 --> 34:56.708
Put that fucking thing away, you asshole.

34:57.375 --> 34:59.541
-Dude… Hans!
-What an awesome show!

34:59.625 --> 35:02.208
-We showed those rich fuckers!
-Not so loud.

35:03.750 --> 35:05.000
Tell me how it went.

35:07.875 --> 35:09.708
They invited me to brunch.

35:33.125 --> 35:35.166
"If you don't shut up right now…"

35:35.875 --> 35:37.458
I almost peed my pants!

35:37.541 --> 35:39.500
Am I a gangster or not?

35:39.583 --> 35:41.500
-Total gangster, Hans.
-Fuck you.

35:48.500 --> 35:49.333
Come on.

35:50.166 --> 35:52.541
Only a few days before she's gone again.

35:52.625 --> 35:55.166
One more.
I was in the trunk while you partied.

35:55.250 --> 35:58.041
It was hard work. Don't you worry.

35:58.125 --> 35:59.625
And now you're her hero.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.583
I have to become her friend.

36:11.291 --> 36:12.166
To Joseph.

36:14.375 --> 36:15.208
To Jo.

36:23.416 --> 36:25.333
