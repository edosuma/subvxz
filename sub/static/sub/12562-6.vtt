00:00.034 --> 00:02.133
Previously on <i>Royal Pains</i>...

00:02.158 --> 00:03.758
We have to cancel the wedding.

00:03.783 --> 00:04.983
What are you saying?

00:05.008 --> 00:06.208
I kind of miss that guy... it's weird.

00:06.233 --> 00:09.633
Again, Evan... I have not spoken
with Raj since our quarantine.

00:09.658 --> 00:12.658
Cyberchondriosis, how can it
not upset me, that sounds awful.

00:13.534 --> 00:17.537
Cyberchondriosis is an obsession
with researching health online.

00:17.539 --> 00:19.172
- That's it?
- Hi. I need to get

00:19.174 --> 00:21.508
the number to the Long Island
Blood Bank in West Islip.

00:21.510 --> 00:22.842
I already phoned them, miss Casey.

00:25.814 --> 00:27.881
I just got some really bad news.

00:27.883 --> 00:29.215
Is it medical in nature?

00:29.217 --> 00:30.984
Unfortunately.

00:30.986 --> 00:32.319
I'm gonna be frank with you, son.

00:32.320 --> 00:34.954
You are not Paige Collins material.

00:34.956 --> 00:36.890
- I'm not?
- As soon as we get home,

00:36.892 --> 00:39.059
I am going straight to the safe deposit box

00:39.061 --> 00:42.062
and getting mom's ring,
so you can propose to Paige.

00:51.739 --> 00:54.474
Hi, honey.
Hope you're having fun at camp.

00:54.476 --> 00:56.409
I can't wait to see you tomorrow.

00:56.411 --> 00:57.777
I will pick you up at the airport.

00:57.779 --> 00:59.179
Love you.

00:59.181 --> 01:00.747
Oh, and don't forget to call your mom.

01:18.032 --> 01:20.033
- Hey, babe.
- Oh, hi.

01:20.035 --> 01:22.902
Mmm.

01:22.904 --> 01:25.138
- Marco.
- <i>Ciao,</i> Anna.

01:28.510 --> 01:31.277
Oh, uh, he says it's nice to see you.

01:31.279 --> 01:33.179
Why is Marco smoking around us?

01:33.181 --> 01:34.681
Why is he even here?

01:34.683 --> 01:37.384
I told you I would help you
with this today.

01:37.386 --> 01:39.919
I know you have work to do, and... ah!

01:39.921 --> 01:41.921
Ooh.

01:41.923 --> 01:44.457
Okay, don't... stay calm. Don't freak out.

01:44.459 --> 01:45.792
- You need a tetanus shot...
- No.

01:45.794 --> 01:47.627
...and stitches. I'm calling a doctor.

01:47.629 --> 01:49.429
Don't freak out.

01:49.431 --> 01:50.964
Don't freak out.

01:50.966 --> 01:53.099
I'm okay.

01:58.272 --> 01:59.906
Then after I swing by Divya's,

01:59.908 --> 02:01.474
I'll head back out to wind meadows.

02:01.476 --> 02:03.443
You're gonna drive all
the way back out to that farm

02:03.445 --> 02:05.245
- just to remove some sutures?
- Yeah.

02:05.247 --> 02:06.780
No, that's crazy. If she lives outside

02:06.782 --> 02:08.648
the Hankmed zone, she should come to us

02:08.650 --> 02:10.183
or pay a roaming charge or something.

02:10.185 --> 02:12.485
She's a patient, not a text message.

02:12.487 --> 02:14.254
- Oh, my...
- And her daughter's our friend.

02:14.256 --> 02:17.056
I'm going to her.

02:18.993 --> 02:22.228
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

02:27.334 --> 02:30.603
Wow.

02:30.605 --> 02:32.939
I'm really doing this.

02:32.941 --> 02:36.309
Wow. You're really doing this.

03:05.272 --> 03:06.573
Huh.

03:06.575 --> 03:09.042
It's kind of smaller than I remember.

03:09.044 --> 03:11.578
When we were smaller...

03:11.580 --> 03:13.713
it probably seemed bigger.

03:13.715 --> 03:16.349
I just wonder if it's beautiful enough.

03:16.351 --> 03:18.451
Evan...

03:18.453 --> 03:20.386
It's beautiful.

03:23.390 --> 03:26.993
Yeah.

03:26.995 --> 03:29.462
Yeah, it is.

03:29.464 --> 03:32.699
It's off the market. Congratulations.

03:34.468 --> 03:35.969
Thank you.

03:35.971 --> 03:38.505
- All right, there you go.
- Thank you.

03:41.442 --> 03:43.443
Thank you for doing this,
especially today.

03:43.445 --> 03:45.445
I know that you're trying
to catch up with everything

03:45.447 --> 03:46.913
after being away.

03:46.915 --> 03:48.348
Thank you for holding down the fort

03:48.350 --> 03:49.816
while Evan and I were in Florida,

03:49.818 --> 03:53.119
for taking care of Marissa,
the baby, Jill.

03:53.121 --> 03:54.654
Who seems to be doing better.

03:54.656 --> 03:56.923
Yeah, I think she's still processing it.

03:56.925 --> 03:58.791
- Mm.
- So...

03:58.793 --> 04:01.094
how does it feel to be a first-time renter?

04:01.096 --> 04:03.530
Good. I'm just still embarrassed

04:03.532 --> 04:04.898
that you had to cosign my lease.

04:04.900 --> 04:06.633
Just don't throw any wild parties, now.

04:06.635 --> 04:08.234
Don't worry. I can't afford to.

04:08.236 --> 04:12.272
I have to be frugal now,
cut back on many luxuries...

04:12.274 --> 04:14.173
- Like eating.
- Hmm.

04:23.651 --> 04:25.385
Anybody home?

04:25.387 --> 04:27.487
Elyse? Anna?

04:27.489 --> 04:30.256
- Back here in the kitchen.
- Ah.

04:31.892 --> 04:33.226
Wow.

04:33.228 --> 04:35.028
Looks like somebody went crazy at Costco.

04:36.598 --> 04:38.932
Actually, we use fruit punch
powder to dye alpaca hair.

04:38.934 --> 04:40.667
Huh.

04:40.669 --> 04:42.168
And you should see what we drink.

04:42.170 --> 04:44.604
- Hi!
- Hey, Libby.

04:44.606 --> 04:47.140
- It's so good to see you.
- You too.

04:47.142 --> 04:48.875
- How's your summer going?
- It's been great.

04:48.877 --> 04:51.811
Uh, not really
as good as Tucker's, but...

04:51.813 --> 04:53.012
Yeah, well, it's hard to top

04:53.014 --> 04:55.148
a photo safari in Africa with your dad.

04:55.150 --> 04:56.950
Did you see those pictures
he uploaded last week?

04:56.952 --> 04:58.518
Yeah, they were pretty incredible.

04:58.520 --> 05:00.286
My mom thinks he could be
a professional photographer.

05:00.288 --> 05:03.256
She's probably right.
Where is our favorite farmer?

05:03.258 --> 05:06.192
- Out back unloading hay.
- Arm's not slowing her down?

05:06.194 --> 05:09.495
Death won't slow Elyse down.
She's very goal-oriented.

05:09.497 --> 05:11.464
Anna, honey,

05:11.466 --> 05:13.666
I thought I told you
to cancel the appointment.

05:13.668 --> 05:15.602
Today's not good.
I have two newborn lambs

05:15.604 --> 05:17.170
- that need to be...
- Mom, hi.

05:17.172 --> 05:21.307
Uh, Hank drove all the way
out here to see you.

05:24.179 --> 05:25.945
- I'm sorry.
- Elyse...

05:25.947 --> 05:28.181
This will just take a few seconds.

05:40.527 --> 05:44.864
So I get out of the hot tub,
and I'm naked,

05:44.866 --> 05:47.033
- which is normal, right?
- Yeah.

05:47.035 --> 05:48.401
- It's a hot tub, right?
- Right.

05:48.403 --> 05:49.969
That's what I told him. God.

05:49.971 --> 05:53.072
Anyway, so Hank looks
at my ass... that's not normal.

05:53.074 --> 05:55.041
- Not so much.
- He sees my bullet wound,

05:55.043 --> 05:57.877
and he diagnoses this patient
with lead poisoning.

05:57.879 --> 05:59.879
Okay, Evan, I can't believe
you didn't tell me this

05:59.881 --> 06:01.047
as soon as you got back.

06:01.049 --> 06:02.682
- I know. I couldn't.
- Why?

06:02.684 --> 06:05.184
- You tell me everything.
- It was too humiliating.

06:05.186 --> 06:08.688
You have all four seasons
of <i>Saved By The Bell</i> on DVD.

06:08.690 --> 06:11.290
Look... Oh, my God!

06:11.292 --> 06:12.659
You remember?

06:12.661 --> 06:14.327
It looks just like
the one we took pictures in

06:14.329 --> 06:15.528
on our first date ever.

06:15.530 --> 06:16.996
Oh, technically, it wasn't a first date,

06:16.998 --> 06:18.264
since I was paying you.

06:18.266 --> 06:19.532
Yeah, but it was
the first time we ever kissed.

06:19.534 --> 06:21.167
- Again, technically...
- Just come on.

06:21.169 --> 06:22.535
Okay, okay.

06:22.537 --> 06:24.704
Here we go. All right, get in there.

06:29.877 --> 06:32.045
Just don't make goofy faces this time.

06:32.047 --> 06:33.680
I didn't make goofy faces last time.

06:33.682 --> 06:34.981
Oh, my bad.

06:34.983 --> 06:37.316
- Okay, um, listen, Paige...
- Yeah?

06:37.318 --> 06:39.185
I've waited my whole life

06:39.187 --> 06:41.354
to find a girl
I love as much as I love you.

06:41.356 --> 06:43.389
Evan, that's so sweet.

06:43.391 --> 06:44.691
- Okay, stop talking.
- Why?

06:44.693 --> 06:47.827
'Cause I only have two flashes left.

06:47.829 --> 06:49.328
Hold on.

06:49.330 --> 06:51.197
Paige Collins, will you marry me?

06:51.199 --> 06:52.665
Yes!

06:52.667 --> 06:53.733
- Yes?
- Yes!

06:53.735 --> 06:56.703
Yes! Mmm.

07:05.479 --> 07:07.246
It's perfect.

07:07.248 --> 07:10.550
- Do you really like it?
- Evan, I love it.

07:10.552 --> 07:12.385
And it was your mom's.

07:12.387 --> 07:14.554
How could I not love it?

07:14.556 --> 07:17.290
I'm so glad.

07:19.993 --> 07:21.861
So when did you ask my dad?

07:21.863 --> 07:24.163
- People still do that?
- Oh, no.

07:24.165 --> 07:26.766
- You didn't ask him?
- I don't want to marry him.

07:26.768 --> 07:29.802
I want to marry you.
And he hates my guts.

07:29.804 --> 07:31.537
Okay, no, no. He does not hate your guts.

07:31.539 --> 07:35.341
But if he finds out that you asked me

07:35.343 --> 07:37.643
before you asked him if you could ask me,

07:37.645 --> 07:41.447
it's just gonna make
everything so much worse.

07:41.449 --> 07:44.050
He shot me in the ass.

07:44.052 --> 07:46.385
How could it get worse?

07:46.387 --> 07:49.021
Okay, look, I know my father.

07:49.023 --> 07:50.623
And with a little bit of planning,

07:50.625 --> 07:51.991
we can get him to see it our way.

07:51.993 --> 07:53.493
I promise.

07:53.495 --> 07:55.428
But in the meantime,

07:55.430 --> 07:58.064
I...

07:58.066 --> 08:00.466
I can't be walking around
with this on my finger,

08:00.468 --> 08:01.868
as much as I want to.

08:01.870 --> 08:04.070
I'm so sorry.

08:34.594 --> 08:38.594
Royal Pains 3x06 - An Apple A Day
Original air date August 3, 2011

08:38.619 --> 08:44.619
Sync and corrected by atrn97g
www.addic7ed.com

08:48.875 --> 08:50.276
Should it look like that?

08:50.278 --> 08:52.778
No.

08:52.780 --> 08:55.314
Sorry. I'll let you be the doctor.

08:55.316 --> 08:57.750
It shouldn't take this long
to heal properly.

08:57.752 --> 08:59.719
I mean, you're
a healthy 40-year-old woman.

08:59.721 --> 09:01.854
Are you putting the stitches back?

09:01.856 --> 09:03.322
Uh, no, they're called steri-strips.

09:03.324 --> 09:05.324
I'm not re-suturing it,
because there's a chance

09:05.326 --> 09:07.026
the open laceration is contaminated.

09:07.028 --> 09:09.061
So I want to minimize
the risk of infection.

09:09.063 --> 09:10.896
And it should just heal
on its own, right, Hank?

09:10.898 --> 09:12.732
In another three to five days, yeah.

09:12.734 --> 09:15.167
Oh! Oh, my God.

09:15.169 --> 09:16.602
It's one of my friends from camp.

09:16.604 --> 09:18.037
I'm gonna go Skype, okay, guys?

09:18.039 --> 09:19.071
- Oh, boy.
- Bye!

09:19.073 --> 09:20.740
Bye.

09:20.742 --> 09:24.643
So, Elyse, is anything else
going on, health-wise?

09:24.645 --> 09:26.379
Not really.

09:26.381 --> 09:27.847
Not really?

09:27.849 --> 09:30.016
Babe, what about the bruises
on your legs?

09:30.018 --> 09:31.851
What bruises?

09:34.988 --> 09:36.789
- How'd you get these?
- Don't know.

09:36.791 --> 09:38.924
It's a very physical time
of year for me, so...

09:38.926 --> 09:40.359
Uh-huh.

09:40.361 --> 09:42.695
I want to take a blood sample.

09:44.532 --> 09:45.664
Okay.

09:45.666 --> 09:47.833
Are your muscles achy?

09:47.835 --> 09:49.902
Part of owning a farm.

09:49.904 --> 09:52.671
Any recent diet changes?

09:52.673 --> 09:54.573
Around here? No, no.

09:54.575 --> 09:56.575
They eat healthy food.
I eat everything else.

09:56.577 --> 09:58.677
Okay, this is gonna pinch a little bit.

09:58.679 --> 10:00.679
Mm.

10:00.681 --> 10:02.481
Okay, what about bad habits?

10:02.483 --> 10:04.083
Does Reality TV count?

10:04.085 --> 10:08.020
No, I meant things like drugs, smoking...

10:08.022 --> 10:10.056
Look, I like to have
a glass of wine at dinner,

10:10.058 --> 10:11.891
I'm in a monogamous relationship.

10:11.893 --> 10:15.828
Hank, I'm fine,
and so are my habits, really.

10:15.830 --> 10:17.396
Why do you need to take blood?

10:17.398 --> 10:19.165
It'll help us figure out
why she's not clotting

10:19.167 --> 10:20.733
as well as she should.

10:20.735 --> 10:23.369
Slow-healing wounds
and bruises of an unknown origin

10:23.371 --> 10:24.770
can suggest a number of things.

10:24.772 --> 10:26.806
- Like what?
- It could be some kind

10:26.808 --> 10:29.241
of infection, an autoimmune disease.

10:29.243 --> 10:31.377
We'll see what the tests show.

10:31.379 --> 10:34.447
And for being such a good patient...

10:34.449 --> 10:35.848
Lollipop.

10:35.850 --> 10:37.917
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

10:37.919 --> 10:40.453
We have to keep
that sweet tooth in check.

10:40.455 --> 10:42.054
All right, let me walk you to your car.

10:42.056 --> 10:43.456
Okay.

10:45.492 --> 10:49.829
Look, I wasn't completely honest
with you about bad habits.

10:49.831 --> 10:52.098
I just didn't want to
say anything in front of Anna,

10:52.100 --> 10:56.802
'cause she doesn't know,
and Libby doesn't know either.

11:25.432 --> 11:27.566
Well?

11:27.568 --> 11:29.969
- Well...
- What?

11:29.971 --> 11:32.738
She said yes.

11:32.740 --> 11:34.940
That's great! Ev, that's great.

11:34.942 --> 11:36.775
Yeah. Yeah.

11:36.777 --> 11:38.644
I'm sensing a "but."

11:38.646 --> 11:41.147
But I got to get
the general's blessing first.

11:41.149 --> 11:43.349
Wait, wait, wait.
You didn't ask her father?

11:43.351 --> 11:44.850
You knew people still did that?

11:44.852 --> 11:46.352
Why would you not tell me that?

11:46.354 --> 11:47.786
I don't know.
I just assumed you and I lived

11:47.788 --> 11:48.921
in the same society.

11:48.923 --> 11:50.856
Oh, I've been waiting for that one.

11:50.858 --> 11:52.424
- Hey, Div.
- Hi.

11:52.426 --> 11:55.528
Come here.

11:55.530 --> 11:58.164
I need to come up with a speech

11:58.166 --> 12:00.566
to convince the general
that I'm worthy of his daughter.

12:00.568 --> 12:04.370
It has to be my Mona Lisa,
my <i>Sergeant Pepper's,</i>

12:04.372 --> 12:05.671
my <i>Life of Pi.</i>

12:05.673 --> 12:06.972
I need to use impressive words,

12:06.974 --> 12:09.508
like "alacrity" and "capricious."

12:09.510 --> 12:10.976
I have to open my heart

12:10.978 --> 12:14.346
and let that magnificent bastard
look inside.

12:14.348 --> 12:16.315
Would that work
on the general or... anyone?

12:16.317 --> 12:18.350
You're right. A speech
is not gonna work at all.

12:18.352 --> 12:20.753
General Collins strikes me
as a no-nonsense type of guy.

12:20.755 --> 12:22.254
Why not keep it simple, you know?

12:22.256 --> 12:24.190
Just talk about
the things you have in common.

12:24.192 --> 12:25.658
Okay.

12:25.660 --> 12:27.493
The only thing he and I have
in common, though,

12:27.495 --> 12:29.828
is that neither one of us
were raised by wolves.

12:29.830 --> 12:30.896
That's not true.

12:30.898 --> 12:32.665
You have one other thing in common.

12:32.667 --> 12:34.867
What's that?

12:34.869 --> 12:36.602
You both love Paige.

13:03.930 --> 13:07.066
Wait, please.

13:07.068 --> 13:10.102
Aah!

13:10.104 --> 13:12.504
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

13:12.506 --> 13:14.173
Shh, shh.

13:14.175 --> 13:16.175
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

13:16.177 --> 13:18.310
You're just having that nightmare again.

13:18.312 --> 13:21.780
Shh. Shh.

13:28.455 --> 13:31.457
It's okay.

13:37.294 --> 13:39.496
I don't know what I was so worried about.

13:39.498 --> 13:42.165
I mean, it feels great to be independent,

13:42.167 --> 13:43.700
on my own two feet.

13:43.702 --> 13:45.134
So you're all settled in?

13:45.136 --> 13:46.903
I haven't unpacked yet, no.

13:46.905 --> 13:49.973
I had no idea what
moving into a new home entailed.

13:49.975 --> 13:51.908
Well, don't worry.
I got things here covered.

13:51.910 --> 13:54.644
I'm on my way to Elyse's
to get another blood sample.

13:54.646 --> 13:56.279
What happened to the first one?

13:56.281 --> 13:58.348
The lab didn't store it
properly, and it hemolyzed.

13:58.350 --> 14:00.850
- It happens.
- Well, the cable company

14:00.852 --> 14:03.253
gave me a window from 8:00 to 5:00.

14:03.255 --> 14:05.588
But I'm hoping that they'll be
here sooner rather than later,

14:05.590 --> 14:07.257
and then I'll come meet up with you.

14:07.259 --> 14:08.758
Good luck with that.

14:19.203 --> 14:20.670
There.

14:23.807 --> 14:26.876
Okay.

14:26.878 --> 14:28.845
- Hey, handsome.
- Good morning.

14:28.847 --> 14:31.548
Hi.

14:31.550 --> 14:33.616
I'm sorry I kept you up last night.

14:33.618 --> 14:35.318
Oh, stop it. You didn't.

14:35.320 --> 14:37.487
I don't know why
I keep having these nightmares.

14:37.489 --> 14:39.589
You were in an accident.
Now you're reliving the trauma.

14:39.591 --> 14:41.291
I mean, it's part
of the recovery process.

14:42.727 --> 14:46.729
But, Hank, it feels so real...

14:46.731 --> 14:50.934
Like someone else came up to the car.

14:50.936 --> 14:54.437
Well, um, the paramedics
were there, right?

14:56.507 --> 15:00.243
It's not just the nightmares, Hank.

15:00.245 --> 15:03.813
I'm jumpy every time I get into a car.

15:05.249 --> 15:08.284
Maybe you should talk to someone.

15:08.286 --> 15:10.119
You think it's PTSD?

15:10.121 --> 15:12.789
I think it could develop into that.

15:12.791 --> 15:15.725
I can give you some referrals.

15:15.727 --> 15:17.860
No, it's fine.

15:17.862 --> 15:19.596
I know a few people in that area.

15:19.598 --> 15:22.098
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

15:23.601 --> 15:25.702
Mmm. Okay, I'll see you later.

15:25.704 --> 15:27.403
Okay.

15:30.174 --> 15:32.442
Don't worry. They don't bite.

15:32.444 --> 15:34.577
Oh, so they'll just swallow me whole.

15:34.579 --> 15:35.979
- Yeah.
- Cool. Cool.

15:35.981 --> 15:37.814
Excuse me, my dear. Thank you.

15:37.816 --> 15:40.149
So, uh, how long have you
and Elyse been doing this?

15:40.151 --> 15:43.286
- Um, two years.
- Mm.

15:43.288 --> 15:45.722
And we've been together seven.

15:45.724 --> 15:47.857
I was working at this organic craft store

15:47.859 --> 15:49.092
in the village.

15:49.094 --> 15:50.927
- She came in with Libby.
- Mm-hmm.

15:50.929 --> 15:52.762
You think she's cute now, oh, my God.

15:52.764 --> 15:54.831
And Elyse had, like, a thousand questions

15:54.833 --> 15:57.767
- about different products.
- Sounds very enterprising.

15:57.769 --> 16:00.436
Elyse's life experience trumps mine.

16:00.438 --> 16:02.305
She's amazing... a genius, really.

16:02.307 --> 16:04.207
She'll start something,
make it successful

16:04.209 --> 16:06.509
and then start something else.

16:06.511 --> 16:08.378
It's almost intimidating.

16:08.380 --> 16:10.279
Hmm.

16:10.281 --> 16:11.881
Hey.

16:11.883 --> 16:14.150
Oh, Hank. With the amount
of blood you want from me,

16:14.152 --> 16:15.818
I'm surprised to see you out in daylight.

16:15.820 --> 16:18.421
Sorry. I am trying to let
you keep some for yourself.

16:31.535 --> 16:33.436
- I brought lunch.
- Oh!

16:33.438 --> 16:34.971
Great.

16:34.973 --> 16:37.040
Let's see. Ah.

16:37.042 --> 16:40.209
Too healthy, too healthy,

16:40.211 --> 16:42.512
too healthy, way too healthy,

16:42.514 --> 16:44.914
aha! Some real food.

16:46.317 --> 16:48.217
Don't I have the best partner
in the world?

16:48.219 --> 16:49.886
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say yes.

16:49.888 --> 16:51.688
I don't know what I would do without her.

16:51.690 --> 16:54.323
What or who?

16:54.325 --> 16:57.193
All right, let's give Hank
some blood, okay?

16:57.195 --> 16:59.195
Hank...

16:59.197 --> 17:02.198
You have to take home
some of our alpaca cheese.

17:02.200 --> 17:04.666
It's even better than the cheese
we make from our goats.

17:04.669 --> 17:07.203
Is the, uh... is the milk
you use pasteurized?

17:07.204 --> 17:09.539
- No. Why?
- Well, there are certain types

17:09.540 --> 17:11.773
of diseases that can be transmitted

17:11.776 --> 17:14.510
from animals to humans
by eating infected food products

17:14.512 --> 17:16.279
or even by contact.

17:16.281 --> 17:18.013
I'd like to talk to your vet
about testing your animals.

17:18.016 --> 17:20.383
- She lives just two farms down.
- Great.

17:20.385 --> 17:22.318
Also, I noticed you were limping.

17:22.319 --> 17:24.520
You weren't yesterday.

17:24.521 --> 17:26.989
That's because my legs weren't
hurting as much yesterday.

17:26.991 --> 17:28.858
Uh-huh. Can I take a look, please?

17:33.698 --> 17:37.366
These bruises should
be healing faster than this.

17:37.368 --> 17:39.936
See how soon your vet can get here.

17:52.116 --> 17:54.317
If my father is secure at all points?

17:54.319 --> 17:55.685
Be prepared for him.

17:55.687 --> 17:57.186
- If he is in superior strength?
- Evade him.

17:57.188 --> 17:59.355
- When you are not expected?
- Appear.

17:59.357 --> 18:02.692
- And when he is unprepared?
- Attack him!

18:02.694 --> 18:04.460
But with love.

18:16.440 --> 18:18.007
Yes!

18:18.009 --> 18:20.109
Congratulations, soldier.
You are ready for battle.

18:20.111 --> 18:21.644
Oh, finally.

18:21.646 --> 18:23.713
I got you a graduation present.

18:23.715 --> 18:25.214
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

18:25.216 --> 18:27.984
Does it have a soft top and bucket seats?

18:27.986 --> 18:30.987
It's a galley copy of my
father's upcoming autobiography.

18:30.989 --> 18:33.489
I borrowed it from his safe.

18:33.491 --> 18:34.791
<i>"Never Surrender."</i>

18:34.793 --> 18:36.459
Sounds like an easy read.

18:36.461 --> 18:39.562
I'll read it tonight,
right after <i>30 Rock.</i>

18:39.564 --> 18:41.230
- It's a rerun.
- I will DVR <i>30 Rock.</i>

18:41.232 --> 18:42.298
Yeah, you will.

18:44.168 --> 18:47.937
Ah, so I talked to the vet,
and she's going to...

18:47.939 --> 18:49.472
what...

18:49.474 --> 18:51.574
I've been getting
a couple nosebleeds lately.

18:51.576 --> 18:53.109
Elyse, in order to help you,

18:53.111 --> 18:54.877
these are the things
I need to know about.

18:54.879 --> 18:56.612
I didn't realize it was important.

18:56.614 --> 18:58.648
Look, I'm sure it'll stop soon.

18:58.650 --> 19:01.017
- How long's it been bleeding?
- 30 minutes.

19:01.019 --> 19:03.486
That's too long. Please have a seat.

19:09.660 --> 19:13.262
Okay... Okay, let me take a look.

19:17.334 --> 19:20.703
Yep, you've got a ruptured blood vessel.

19:20.705 --> 19:22.872
Okay.

19:22.874 --> 19:25.541
I'm gonna use silver nitrate
to cauterize it.

19:30.280 --> 19:34.150
Okay, here we go.

19:34.152 --> 19:36.419
Okay.

19:39.189 --> 19:41.357
All right, I want you to put
these saline drops

19:41.359 --> 19:44.060
into your nose to keep
your mucus membranes hydrated

19:44.062 --> 19:47.630
and hopefully to prevent future bleeding.

19:47.632 --> 19:49.031
Elyse...

19:49.033 --> 19:51.834
What is it?

19:51.836 --> 19:55.204
I... I've been an overachiever
my entire life.

19:55.206 --> 19:57.807
By the time I was four,
I was already five.

19:57.809 --> 20:00.343
Well, that would make
for a brief childhood.

20:00.345 --> 20:02.278
Both my parents
were successful entrepreneurs,

20:02.280 --> 20:05.848
and they expected... no, they demanded

20:05.850 --> 20:07.783
the same from their only child.

20:07.785 --> 20:10.486
Well, it sure seems like you delivered.

20:10.488 --> 20:12.188
Yeah, but at what cost?

20:12.190 --> 20:14.957
When I'm out here, I'm not even aware

20:14.959 --> 20:17.260
of what's going on in there.

20:17.262 --> 20:18.961
I lose sight of everything.

20:18.963 --> 20:21.731
Well, we all do, you know, at times.

20:21.733 --> 20:24.066
And then your doctor tells you

20:24.068 --> 20:25.534
that there's something wrong with you

20:25.536 --> 20:27.603
and he doesn't know what it is,

20:27.605 --> 20:29.805
and your mind goes to dark places.

20:29.807 --> 20:33.175
The only thing that's important
to me are Libby and Anna,

20:33.177 --> 20:34.911
and I don't think they know that.

20:34.913 --> 20:37.813
You know what? Most people
realize that when it's too late.

20:37.815 --> 20:41.384
You're ahead of the curve...

20:41.386 --> 20:43.252
Right where you like to be.

20:48.425 --> 20:50.092
- Well, hey.
- Hey, you.

20:50.094 --> 20:52.161
Hi.

20:52.163 --> 20:53.529
So...

20:53.531 --> 20:55.765
I heard about the problem
you had with the blood.

20:55.767 --> 20:58.267
Yeah, you should've seen
the look your mom gave me.

20:58.269 --> 20:59.769
Just imagine having two moms.

20:59.771 --> 21:02.004
- I can't.
- To be honest,

21:02.006 --> 21:04.106
when my mom first got with Anna,
it was weird.

21:04.108 --> 21:05.341
Because she was...

21:05.343 --> 21:06.442
- So young.
- Exactly.

21:06.444 --> 21:07.877
- That's... yeah.
- Yeah.

21:07.879 --> 21:10.146
But Anna is more
in tune with my mom and me

21:10.148 --> 21:13.282
- than my father ever was.
- That's great.

21:13.284 --> 21:14.951
Some light summer reading?

21:14.953 --> 21:19.221
Oh, um, it's just a habit
that I picked up at camp.

21:19.223 --> 21:20.656
What kind of camp has you reading

21:20.658 --> 21:22.191
<i>The New England Journal Of Medicine?</i>

21:22.193 --> 21:24.827
- Mini-Med summer camp at Brown.
- Oh, nice.

21:24.829 --> 21:26.829
After everything that you did for Tucker,

21:26.831 --> 21:28.197
it really got me thinking.

21:28.199 --> 21:30.299
I mean, I don't want to just sit around,

21:30.301 --> 21:32.234
like, worrying about
what's gonna happen to him.

21:32.236 --> 21:33.436
I want to understand it.

21:33.438 --> 21:35.538
Tucker's one lucky guy.

21:35.540 --> 21:37.940
I tell him that every day.

21:41.411 --> 21:42.979
Hello, this is Alexander.

21:42.981 --> 21:45.681
Please leave your phone number,
starting with the area code.

21:45.683 --> 21:47.283
I'm sorry, Alexander,

21:47.285 --> 21:49.518
but I have actually already
punched in my phone number,

21:49.520 --> 21:51.420
so what was the point the first time?

21:51.422 --> 21:53.122
And you know what? If we're
gonna talk about points,

21:53.124 --> 21:54.357
what is the point...

21:54.359 --> 21:55.791
...of an appointment?

21:55.793 --> 21:58.794
All right, never mind.
You're here... finally!

22:03.834 --> 22:06.535
Hello, Divya.

22:06.537 --> 22:09.338
Raj.

22:22.486 --> 22:24.887
This is, uh...

22:24.889 --> 22:26.889
Cozy.

22:27.991 --> 22:31.260
Is there more of it?

22:31.262 --> 22:34.530
No.

22:34.532 --> 22:37.133
Please, have a seat anywhere.

22:42.839 --> 22:44.507
Can I make you some tea?

22:44.509 --> 22:48.377
Uh, no, thank you. I... I won't be long.

22:53.016 --> 22:55.918
How are you?

22:55.920 --> 22:58.254
I'm great.

22:58.256 --> 23:00.856
- How are you?
- I'm well.

23:02.260 --> 23:04.260
But after you called off the wedding,

23:04.262 --> 23:07.763
my parents, as you might imagine,

23:07.765 --> 23:10.900
were... humiliated.

23:10.902 --> 23:15.104
They'd gone to great expense
to fly in dozens of relatives,

23:15.106 --> 23:18.808
arranged a lavish luncheon
for the day after the wedding,

23:18.810 --> 23:20.876
and, of course...

23:20.878 --> 23:23.012
organized the honeymoon.

23:23.014 --> 23:25.381
Okay.

23:26.883 --> 23:29.485
My point is...

23:29.487 --> 23:31.887
they feel entitled to restitution.

23:31.889 --> 23:34.156
Restitution?

23:35.625 --> 23:39.195
An accounting of the
expenses they incurred.

23:44.000 --> 23:46.769
They wanted to hire a lawyer.
I got them to wait.

23:46.771 --> 23:49.538
But they are gonna come after you.

23:54.544 --> 23:56.512
My parents cut me off, Raj.

23:56.514 --> 23:58.414
I can't afford this.

23:58.416 --> 24:01.517
I mean, I can't even afford
the gratuity on this.

24:04.421 --> 24:07.723
I am really sorry for what
your parents have gone through.

24:07.725 --> 24:10.426
But I simply have nothing to offer them.

24:10.428 --> 24:13.863
Actually, uh...

24:13.865 --> 24:16.065
that's not true.

24:18.802 --> 24:22.304
They know that you own 1/3rd of Hankmed.

24:33.367 --> 24:34.701
- Hey.
- Hey.

24:34.703 --> 24:37.237
I got word back from the lab and the vet.

24:37.239 --> 24:38.972
The animals tested negative,

24:38.974 --> 24:41.141
and Elyse's blood work
came back clean, too.

24:42.644 --> 24:45.145
A bleeding problem that
doesn't show up in blood work?

24:45.147 --> 24:46.646
- I know.
- I guess it's time

24:46.648 --> 24:48.581
- to bring in a hematologist.
- Do you want me to call Elyse?

24:48.583 --> 24:50.083
No, I think we should head out there.

24:50.085 --> 24:52.218
I had to twist her arm
just to get her to see me.

24:52.220 --> 24:53.553
She's gonna need some convincing.

24:53.555 --> 24:55.288
- Let's do it.
- Hey, Hank...

24:55.290 --> 24:57.424
before we go, can I talk to you?

24:57.426 --> 24:59.225
Of course, what's up?

24:59.227 --> 25:01.628
Is there any world in which you and Evan

25:01.630 --> 25:04.898
would be interested
in buying my share of Hankmed?

25:04.900 --> 25:07.967
Are you... are you leaving Hankmed?

25:07.969 --> 25:11.337
No, no. I'm not going anywhere.

25:11.339 --> 25:12.872
I... I just...

25:12.874 --> 25:15.508
I think it might be
financially prudent for me,

25:15.510 --> 25:17.177
you know, for my future.

25:17.179 --> 25:19.612
Divya, listen...

25:19.614 --> 25:22.816
I was scared the first time
I signed a lease, too.

25:22.818 --> 25:25.251
If you want, Evan can review
your numbers again.

25:25.253 --> 25:26.619
Nope, you are right.

25:26.621 --> 25:29.956
Uh, I am sure that
it's just renter's remorse.

25:29.958 --> 25:31.524
Yeah, renter's remorse.

25:31.526 --> 25:33.259
Come on.

25:33.261 --> 25:35.295
Let's go.

25:37.398 --> 25:39.265
Then I hear voices saying something,

25:39.267 --> 25:41.734
but it's garbled.

25:41.736 --> 25:45.371
And I see two men walking away.

25:45.373 --> 25:47.373
Why do you think they would abandon you

25:47.375 --> 25:48.842
by the side of the road?

25:48.844 --> 25:52.045
I didn't say "abandon,"
Dr. Sylvander... you did.

25:52.047 --> 25:54.314
They just...

25:54.316 --> 25:57.817
left.

25:57.819 --> 26:00.086
Okay, I don't have abandonment issues.

26:00.088 --> 26:02.021
I didn't say that you did.

26:02.023 --> 26:05.124
And I'm curious why you reacted
so strongly to that word.

26:05.126 --> 26:06.493
I had a marriage

26:06.495 --> 26:08.728
that ended when my husband
couldn't stay put.

26:08.730 --> 26:10.797
Now I have this boyfriend who...

26:10.799 --> 26:13.299
okay, he's not really my boyfriend.

26:13.301 --> 26:15.235
We dated, and then we broke up.

26:15.237 --> 26:18.338
But, anyway, now I've got
one foot out the door

26:18.340 --> 26:21.341
because I have this job
waiting for me in South America.

26:21.343 --> 26:24.978
But we're still seeing
each other sort of, in a way.

26:24.980 --> 26:28.615
Um, actually, he's the one who
recommended I see a therapist.

26:28.617 --> 26:31.818
How did you feel when
your not-really-a-boyfriend

26:31.820 --> 26:33.786
suggested you see a therapist?

26:33.788 --> 26:35.455
He's a doctor.

26:35.457 --> 26:37.357
It was his professional opinion

26:37.359 --> 26:40.927
that I should be concerned
about developing PTSD.

26:40.929 --> 26:43.630
Jill, you went to someone
you were involved with

26:43.632 --> 26:45.331
because you were scared and confused

26:45.333 --> 26:46.900
and you wanted to be comforted.

26:46.902 --> 26:48.968
He recommended professional help.

26:48.970 --> 26:52.005
Is that what you were looking for?

27:01.615 --> 27:03.449
When you are not expected?

27:03.451 --> 27:06.019
Appear.

27:08.556 --> 27:10.590
And when he is unprepared?

27:10.592 --> 27:13.426
Attack.

27:21.502 --> 27:24.804
Wait a sec. General Collins!

27:24.806 --> 27:27.740
It's me... it's Evan! That is so crazy.

27:27.742 --> 27:29.442
I didn't know you steamed here.

27:29.444 --> 27:32.412
What are the odds of that?
It's good to see you.

27:32.414 --> 27:34.347
I've been thinking
about joining up here 'cause...

27:34.349 --> 27:37.216
Oh! 'Cause a lot
of my clients are members here.

27:37.218 --> 27:38.651
They keep telling me, specifically...

27:38.653 --> 27:40.954
Son, this is the one hour of the week

27:40.956 --> 27:43.289
when I can relax completely.

27:43.291 --> 27:46.960
- I'm sure you understand.
- Of course I can.

27:55.103 --> 27:57.704
Sorry. Did you say an hour?

28:05.346 --> 28:07.180
Look, there's Anna.

28:07.182 --> 28:10.817
That's a long walk to get your mail.

28:10.819 --> 28:12.952
I needed to walk off some tension.

28:12.954 --> 28:15.188
Oh.

28:15.190 --> 28:16.623
Is everything okay?

28:16.625 --> 28:18.825
Hank, I'm kind of freaking out.

28:18.827 --> 28:21.327
When Elyse walked you
to your car the other day,

28:21.329 --> 28:24.030
you were discussing
something that looked serious.

28:24.032 --> 28:26.599
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I really can't talk about that.

28:26.601 --> 28:28.968
- You should ask Elyse.
- I did.

28:28.970 --> 28:31.871
And she was totally evasive.
She tells me everything.

28:31.873 --> 28:33.840
She tells me stuff I don't want to know.

28:33.842 --> 28:35.742
Why would she keep secrets from me now?

28:35.744 --> 28:37.377
I... I can't answer that for her.

28:37.379 --> 28:39.078
Does it have to do with Marco?

28:39.080 --> 28:40.813
Help! Help!

28:40.815 --> 28:42.281
My mom needs help. She's fainting.

28:42.283 --> 28:44.017
She's hemorrhaging from her nose.

28:44.019 --> 28:47.020
Okay, everybody in the car.
Show me where she is.

28:51.158 --> 28:53.893
Okay, let's go.

28:53.895 --> 28:56.429
Elyse!

28:56.431 --> 28:58.431
What happened?

28:58.433 --> 29:02.035
My... my throat, it won't stop.

29:03.637 --> 29:05.004
Okay, you have a posterior bleed.

29:05.006 --> 29:06.572
Should we take her to the hospital?

29:06.574 --> 29:08.007
We don't have time for that.
I need to stop it now.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.433
Hank, what can I do to help?

29:13.435 --> 29:15.402
Nothing, Libby.
Just give me some room, please.

29:15.404 --> 29:18.038
Elyse, I need you to lean
forward, spit out the blood,

29:18.040 --> 29:19.473
and take gentle, shallow breaths.

29:19.475 --> 29:21.408
She's lost a lot of blood.

29:21.410 --> 29:23.577
She could go into shock if
we don't stop the bleeding soon.

29:23.579 --> 29:25.045
Yep. The bleed is too deep to squeeze.

29:25.047 --> 29:26.246
I need to apply direct pressure.

29:26.248 --> 29:28.215
Okay, Elyse, I need you to sit up.

29:28.217 --> 29:30.050
That's it.

29:30.052 --> 29:33.053
I'm gonna use Lidocaine Jelly
to numb the inside of your nose.

29:35.289 --> 29:36.957
Okay.

29:36.959 --> 29:40.460
One, two, three.

29:40.462 --> 29:42.996
Okay, there are balloons
at the end of the catheters

29:42.998 --> 29:44.765
that I'm gonna inflate with saline.

29:44.767 --> 29:46.733
The pressure should stop the bleeding.

29:48.102 --> 29:49.336
Okay.

29:56.911 --> 29:58.412
Okay.

29:58.414 --> 30:01.281
You're gonna feel some more pressure now.

30:03.184 --> 30:04.751
Okay.

30:04.753 --> 30:06.820
Here we go.

30:09.657 --> 30:11.291
Okay, good.

30:11.293 --> 30:13.193
Good.

30:13.195 --> 30:16.563
All right, now we'll do the other side.

30:16.565 --> 30:18.465
This should keep it in place.

30:18.467 --> 30:21.234
It's not pretty, but it'll do the trick.

30:21.236 --> 30:22.969
- I can't... I can't breathe.
- Oxygen?

30:22.971 --> 30:26.139
Hey.

30:28.943 --> 30:32.279
I just need to take a look.

30:32.281 --> 30:34.514
Okay, good. The bleeding has stopped.

30:34.516 --> 30:35.682
Let's get her up.

30:35.684 --> 30:37.250
Here we go.

30:37.252 --> 30:39.119
One, two, three. Ah.

30:46.127 --> 30:48.028
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:48.030 --> 30:49.796
How'd it go with Libby's mom?

30:49.798 --> 30:51.298
I'm going to see her at the hospital.

30:51.300 --> 30:53.967
- Is she okay?
- At the moment, yeah.

30:53.969 --> 30:55.702
How'd it go with Paige's dad?

30:55.704 --> 30:57.604
Very well.

30:57.606 --> 30:59.306
Really?

30:59.308 --> 31:01.174
Why do you seem so surprised?

31:01.176 --> 31:04.010
No, I'm just, uh...
I'm glad I could help.

31:04.012 --> 31:06.313
Oh, actually, I... I didn't
use your advice.

31:06.315 --> 31:07.681
I used Paige's, but thank you.

31:07.683 --> 31:09.382
Oh.

31:09.384 --> 31:11.685
Okay.

31:11.687 --> 31:14.387
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

31:14.389 --> 31:16.389
- How are you?
- Fine.

31:16.391 --> 31:18.024
Everything's fine.

31:18.026 --> 31:19.926
Hi. Have you guys met?

31:19.928 --> 31:23.497
Uh, Paige, this is my brother, Hank.

31:23.499 --> 31:27.734
Hank, uh, I'd like you to meet
my soon-to-be fiancee, Paige.

31:33.040 --> 31:35.509
What... what... what was that about?

31:35.511 --> 31:37.811
What? Nothing.

31:39.447 --> 31:41.648
So? What happened with my dad?

31:41.650 --> 31:44.484
Well, uh...

31:44.486 --> 31:47.053
Yeah, your dad... he said yes.

31:47.055 --> 31:48.989
Yes, he said yes.

31:48.991 --> 31:50.891
- Aw!
- All we have to do

31:50.893 --> 31:52.959
is wait until after the election.

31:52.961 --> 31:55.295
You know, the standard obstacle
in every great love story.

31:55.297 --> 31:57.998
- He delayed?
- No, he said yes...

31:58.000 --> 31:59.933
Just aft...

31:59.935 --> 32:02.068
Yeah, yes, he... I guess he delayed.

32:02.070 --> 32:03.503
Delay is the beginning of defeat.

32:03.505 --> 32:05.605
That's the title
of chapter 12 of his book.

32:05.607 --> 32:07.207
Didn't you read it?

32:07.209 --> 32:09.376
Matt Damon was on <i>30 Rock...</i>

32:09.378 --> 32:11.077
Again.

32:11.079 --> 32:14.047
Okay, start at the beginning.
What happened?

32:17.218 --> 32:20.520
What's on your mind, son?

32:20.522 --> 32:24.057
I have a feeling this
isn't just a chance encounter,

32:24.059 --> 32:26.993
so just spit it out.

32:26.995 --> 32:30.497
Give me water. Water, please.

32:32.301 --> 32:34.601
Thank you.

32:43.712 --> 32:44.911
That's good stuff.

32:44.913 --> 32:48.882
You want to marry my daughter, don't you?

32:48.884 --> 32:50.584
Yeah.

32:53.321 --> 32:56.856
I always feared this day would come...

32:56.858 --> 32:59.759
Though I thought I'd be
wearing clothes when it did.

32:59.761 --> 33:02.596
Yeah. Yeah, you and me both thought that.

33:02.598 --> 33:05.198
You think you'll be able
to provide for Paige

33:05.200 --> 33:07.400
in the style to which she is accustomed?

33:07.402 --> 33:09.169
Hankmed's only scratching the surface

33:09.171 --> 33:10.470
of its potential so far, sir.

33:10.472 --> 33:12.439
I intend to become a king out here,

33:12.441 --> 33:14.941
so I can treat her like a queen... I do.

33:14.943 --> 33:17.444
Look, it's bad enough
my daughter's in love with you.

33:17.446 --> 33:18.945
But can't all this just wait

33:18.947 --> 33:21.081
until after the campaign is over?

33:21.083 --> 33:24.784
If you're just dating,
press isn't interested.

33:24.786 --> 33:28.021
But the minute you put a ring
on her finger...

33:28.023 --> 33:30.757
Yeah, but the... the public
loves a good romance, though.

33:30.759 --> 33:33.860
- Come on!
- Son...

33:33.862 --> 33:37.564
I don't think you
want this kind of scrutiny.

33:37.566 --> 33:41.668
Your whole family would be subject to it,

33:41.670 --> 33:45.705
if you know what I mean.

33:45.707 --> 33:49.576
I'm not ashamed of my father, sir.

33:49.578 --> 33:52.445
I don't keep secrets.

33:52.447 --> 33:56.283
That's exactly what I'm afraid of.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.755
Yeah, I kind of failed that test, huh?

34:01.757 --> 34:03.623
Your dad already thought
I was a blabbermouth.

34:03.625 --> 34:05.525
Now I just went and verified it for him.

34:05.527 --> 34:07.127
I somehow thought

34:07.129 --> 34:09.262
that not being ashamed of my family

34:09.264 --> 34:11.598
would score me points.

34:11.600 --> 34:14.801
Evan, I love that you don't keep secrets.

34:14.803 --> 34:18.138
And I wish...

34:18.139 --> 34:20.572
You wish what?

34:20.574 --> 34:23.076
I wish he'd said yes today.

34:24.578 --> 34:27.580
Yeah, me too.

34:29.717 --> 34:32.552
- Hey.
- Hi.

34:32.554 --> 34:36.322
I brought you some whole-wheat,
sugar-free oat-bran muffins.

34:36.324 --> 34:38.658
And there is no need to thank me.

34:38.659 --> 34:39.993
Thank you.

34:39.995 --> 34:42.329
Uh, did you call Marco
about the feed delivery?

34:42.331 --> 34:44.197
I can handle it.

34:44.199 --> 34:46.966
Okay, what's going on?

34:46.967 --> 34:48.435
You've been acting weird lately.

34:48.437 --> 34:49.768
Do you want us to step out

34:49.771 --> 34:51.404
while you ask her what you asked me?

34:51.406 --> 34:52.472
I'm not stepping anywhere.

34:52.474 --> 34:55.875
I want to see where this is going.

34:55.877 --> 34:58.178
You have been spending

34:58.180 --> 35:01.414
a lot more time working
and less time with me.

35:01.416 --> 35:03.516
And then I see you telling Hank something

35:03.518 --> 35:05.919
that you felt you couldn't say
in front of me?

35:05.921 --> 35:07.854
We've never had secrets.

35:07.856 --> 35:10.090
Smoking. I... I smoke cigarettes.

35:10.092 --> 35:11.257
- What?
- Since when?

35:11.259 --> 35:12.592
I don't know. Two years ago.

35:12.594 --> 35:14.427
I can't believe this.
So you're telling me...

35:14.429 --> 35:17.130
No, let me yell at her first,
and then you can have your turn.

35:17.132 --> 35:18.665
I can't believe this. You're telling me

35:18.667 --> 35:21.101
for the past two years, you've smoked?

35:21.103 --> 35:22.936
How have you pulled that off?

35:22.938 --> 35:25.438
I don't know...
lots of showers and toothpaste.

35:25.440 --> 35:28.074
I only have a couple cigarettes
a day, always outside.

35:28.076 --> 35:30.210
I would grab one with Marco
in the barn or when I'm in town.

35:30.212 --> 35:32.178
Look, I am not proud of smoking.

35:32.180 --> 35:34.013
And I'm not proud of covering it up,

35:34.015 --> 35:36.883
especially when my doctor
asked me about it.

35:36.885 --> 35:39.719
And seriously, that is all we discussed.

35:39.721 --> 35:42.188
What?

35:42.190 --> 35:43.990
What did you think I told Hank?

35:43.992 --> 35:46.326
That you were bored with me.

35:46.328 --> 35:48.661
You know, the seven-year itch.

35:48.663 --> 35:50.497
Anna.

35:50.499 --> 35:52.332
Do I need challenges in my life?

35:52.334 --> 35:54.534
Yes.

35:54.536 --> 35:57.904
But not with my family,
not with the people I love.

36:06.314 --> 36:08.548
- Get a room.
- Oh.

36:08.550 --> 36:10.884
Uh...

36:10.886 --> 36:12.385
Elyse...

36:12.387 --> 36:16.256
has the hair on your arm
always been curly like that?

36:16.258 --> 36:17.724
Now that you mention it,

36:17.726 --> 36:19.692
I thought it was just
another indignity of turning 40.

36:19.694 --> 36:22.228
I thought I'd have to be
shaving by the time I was 50.

36:22.230 --> 36:24.864
Besides the alpaca cheese,
what else do you eat?

36:24.866 --> 36:28.234
Oh, uh, eggs, peanut butter, cereal.

36:28.236 --> 36:30.970
Meat and fish, lots of diet coke.

36:30.972 --> 36:33.072
Any fruits, vegetables?

36:33.074 --> 36:35.308
Not really.

36:35.310 --> 36:37.544
Occasionally, she will have a carrot.

36:37.546 --> 36:40.847
Okay, I'm pretty sure I know
why your blood won't clot.

36:40.849 --> 36:44.217
You're suffering from
a severe vitamin "C" deficiency.

36:44.219 --> 36:46.052
Most people know it as... scurvy.

36:46.054 --> 36:47.420
Yeah, that's right.

36:47.422 --> 36:49.722
But I thought only pirates got scurvy.

36:49.724 --> 36:51.624
It's rare, but all the symptoms line up.

36:51.626 --> 36:54.694
It sounds like you have almost
zero vitamin "C" in your diet.

36:54.696 --> 36:57.297
And not that you need it, but
another reason to quit smoking

36:57.299 --> 36:59.833
is that it lowers the amount
of vitamin "C" in your body.

36:59.835 --> 37:01.167
So...

37:01.169 --> 37:03.736
an apple a day
really would've kept you away?

37:03.738 --> 37:06.739
An orange would've been better.

37:06.741 --> 37:09.209
Hey! Hi.

37:09.211 --> 37:10.543
Can I confess something to you?

37:10.545 --> 37:11.978
- You don't smoke, do you?
- No.

37:11.980 --> 37:13.413
Okay, good.

37:13.415 --> 37:15.381
I have always had
this fear of the unknown.

37:15.383 --> 37:18.218
Interestingly, though,
there is no, like, phobia name

37:18.220 --> 37:19.619
for the fear of the unknown.

37:19.621 --> 37:21.120
There's, um, the fear of something new.

37:21.122 --> 37:23.223
That is kainophobia.
But I don't have that.

37:23.225 --> 37:24.891
Good. What do you have?

37:24.893 --> 37:26.926
A realization.

37:26.928 --> 37:30.396
Hank, that moment my mom
was about to bleed to death,

37:30.398 --> 37:32.999
I realized if you weren't there,

37:33.001 --> 37:35.668
I would not have been able to do
anything to help her.

37:35.670 --> 37:37.604
And I don't ever want to feel
that way again,

37:37.606 --> 37:41.741
whether it's my mom or Tucker...

37:41.743 --> 37:43.409
or anybody.

37:43.411 --> 37:46.212
Knowing you, Libby,
I don't think you ever will.

37:46.214 --> 37:48.581
I'll check in on your mom later.

37:48.583 --> 37:49.916
Okay.

37:49.918 --> 37:52.185
- Hey, Hank!
- Yeah?

37:52.187 --> 37:54.823
Do you guys think
you would maybe ever need

37:54.848 --> 37:57.348
some summer help?
Like... around the office?

37:57.425 --> 37:59.158
I don't know. I never thought about it.

37:59.160 --> 38:00.493
Well, think about it.

38:00.495 --> 38:02.128
I will.

38:20.656 --> 38:23.658
Thank you for meeting me.

38:30.399 --> 38:33.801
I really appreciate the heads-up
you gave me at my house.

38:33.803 --> 38:36.704
I'm sure it wasn't easy
for you to come here.

38:36.706 --> 38:39.841
And I'm really grateful.

38:39.843 --> 38:42.944
- You're a good man, Raj.
- Just not good enough for you.

38:42.946 --> 38:45.179
Please, Raj, can we talk about this?

38:45.181 --> 38:47.849
There's nothing to talk about.

38:55.491 --> 38:56.791
What's this?

38:56.793 --> 38:59.494
It's the first installment.

38:59.496 --> 39:01.562
It's what I can afford right now.

39:01.564 --> 39:03.798
And I'll send that
to your parents every month

39:03.800 --> 39:06.434
until the debt is paid off.

39:06.436 --> 39:08.536
What about your share of Hankmed?

39:08.538 --> 39:10.605
I have already asked Hank and Evan

39:10.607 --> 39:12.940
for more than enough help.

39:12.942 --> 39:17.044
Raj, I am not doing this because
of the threat of some lawsuit.

39:17.046 --> 39:19.881
I am doing this because it is
my responsibility.

39:19.883 --> 39:23.651
And I'm gonna figure out
a way to handle it...

39:23.653 --> 39:25.153
my way.

39:27.723 --> 39:31.359
Good luck with that, Divya.

39:35.030 --> 39:36.798
What do you remember next?

39:36.800 --> 39:39.801
The door opened, I think.

39:39.803 --> 39:41.836
I can feel the warm breeze.

39:41.838 --> 39:43.905
Keep going.

39:49.245 --> 39:52.246
What does that mean to you?

39:52.248 --> 39:54.215
Nothing.

40:20.643 --> 40:24.312
It's not her.

40:29.852 --> 40:32.987
Ev, this was a great idea.

40:32.989 --> 40:35.890
Thank you. I am genuinely relaxed.

40:35.892 --> 40:38.492
Yeah, I got a great deal on
a three-day pass from Groupon.

40:38.494 --> 40:40.094
I only needed one day.

40:40.096 --> 40:42.763
But by buying the three-day,
I essentially got a free day.

40:42.765 --> 40:45.833
Okay, whatever you say.
You're the business brain.

40:45.835 --> 40:48.936
Yeah, uh, speaking of business,

40:48.938 --> 40:52.106
I've been thinking about how
to improve Hankmed's efficiency.

40:52.108 --> 40:53.774
Uh-oh.

40:53.776 --> 40:57.044
"A," we're covering way
too much territory right now.

40:57.046 --> 40:58.713
So our options are,

40:58.715 --> 41:01.082
one, we could lower our standard of care.

41:01.084 --> 41:02.550
- Not an option.
- I agree.

41:02.552 --> 41:05.119
And please don't mix numbered
points with alphabetized points.

41:05.121 --> 41:07.488
- It makes my head spin.
- Noted.

41:07.490 --> 41:10.558
- Thank you.
- So option A/2...

41:10.560 --> 41:13.194
- Nice.
- ...we could increase staff size

41:13.196 --> 41:16.597
to responsibly
increase field of operations

41:16.599 --> 41:19.467
without compromising
our signature Hankmed service.

41:19.469 --> 41:22.703
In short, I want to grow Hankmed.

41:22.705 --> 41:25.139
Yeah, I know.

41:25.141 --> 41:27.408
I've heard these kinds
of suggestions before.

41:27.410 --> 41:28.976
None like these.

41:28.978 --> 41:30.845
Seriously, we're talking
about a whole new level here.

41:30.847 --> 41:32.880
I have a fully fleshed-out business plan.

41:32.882 --> 41:35.716
Is this about you wanting
a bigger business?

41:35.718 --> 41:37.018
Or is this about you wanting

41:37.020 --> 41:40.187
to make this a bigger business for Paige?

41:40.189 --> 41:41.856
It's about both.

41:47.163 --> 41:49.597
Hank, it's me. Call me when you can.

41:49.599 --> 41:52.133
I need to talk to you about the accident.

41:52.135 --> 41:54.602
I figured something out.

41:59.142 --> 42:01.008
Hey. Thank you again.

42:01.010 --> 42:03.477
- I really appreciate this.
- Don't thank me.

42:03.479 --> 42:04.946
We need you around here.

42:10.719 --> 42:12.887
Have a good night.

42:15.724 --> 42:17.558
Hello. I'm Divya.

42:17.560 --> 42:20.561
I'm the physician assistant
on duty tonight.
