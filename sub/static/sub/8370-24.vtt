Where'd you go?

Mtoto?

01:15.446 --> 01:17.429
Here I am! (LAUGHS)

01:18.449 --> 01:21.866
Okay, you got us!
(ALL LAUGHING)

01:21.871 --> 01:23.095
Wait.

01:23.100 --> 01:24.765
Do you hear that?

01:24.770 --> 01:26.898
I don't hear anything.

A lot of birds.

(WHIMPERS)

01:40.489 --> 01:43.864
You don't think they're
vultures, do you?

Vultures?

01:47.244 --> 01:48.695

KION: Lion Guard, this way!

01:52.114 --> 01:53.452
Hi, Beshte!

01:53.457 --> 01:54.474
Hey, Mtoto!

01:54.479 --> 01:57.067
That's an un-Bunga-lievable
bunch of birds!

01:57.072 --> 01:59.726
Yeah. I wonder what's going on.

02:03.433 --> 02:05.375
Look at that!

02:06.418 --> 02:09.335
I've never seen so many
birds in one place.

02:09.340 --> 02:11.505
So what are they all doing here?

02:11.510 --> 02:13.411
I bet Ono could tell us.

02:13.416 --> 02:16.419
But I don't know where he is.
ONO: I'm right here!

02:16.424 --> 02:18.233
I got us a spot right in front!

02:18.238 --> 02:20.286
In front of what?

02:20.291 --> 02:21.896
Let's find out.

02:23.347 --> 02:25.240
Can you believe
he's really back?

02:25.245 --> 02:26.424
After all this time?

02:26.429 --> 02:28.239
Who?
Hadithi!

02:28.244 --> 02:29.348
Who-dithi?

02:29.353 --> 02:30.481
Hadithi?

02:30.486 --> 02:32.053
The legendary eagle?

02:32.058 --> 02:34.716
Every bird in the Pride Lands
has heard of him!

02:34.721 --> 02:37.323
Uh, Ono, we aren't birds!

02:37.328 --> 02:40.405
But you don't have to be a
bird to have heard of Hadithi.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.778
Creator of the Hadithi Spin?

02:42.783 --> 02:44.864
Three mid-air loops
and a corkscrew?

02:44.869 --> 02:46.232
I think.

02:46.237 --> 02:49.335
I've always wanted to ask
Hadithi exactly how it goes.

02:49.340 --> 02:50.685
And now I can.

02:50.690 --> 02:52.575
If I can get up
the nerve, that is.

02:52.580 --> 02:54.263
He's kind of my idol.

02:54.268 --> 02:55.645
He sounds <i> Poa,</i> Ono.

02:55.650 --> 02:57.013
Oh, he is.

02:57.018 --> 02:58.403
And smart.

02:58.408 --> 03:00.212
They say whenever he speaks,

03:00.217 --> 03:02.481
nuggets of wisdom 
fall from his mouth.

03:02.486 --> 03:04.481
Pfft! Big deal.

03:04.486 --> 03:06.739
Nuggets fall outta
my mouth all the time.

(BIRDS SQUAWKING AND CHIRPING)

03:12.846 --> 03:15.317
Greetings, my friends.

03:15.322 --> 03:17.719
Say something wise, Hadithi!

03:17.724 --> 03:20.258
The higher you fly,

03:20.337 --> 03:22.818
the more they'll look up to you.

03:22.823 --> 03:25.247
ALL: Ahhhh! Ooooooooooh!

03:25.252 --> 03:28.544
"The higher you fly, the more
they'll look up to you."

03:28.549 --> 03:30.034
That is so deep.

03:30.039 --> 03:32.478
Really? Seems kind of
obvious to me.

03:32.483 --> 03:34.243
Bunga, shh!

03:34.248 --> 03:36.372
Ono really likes this guy!

03:36.377 --> 03:37.731
Isn't he amazing?

03:37.736 --> 03:39.147
Oh, yeah!

03:39.152 --> 03:40.075
Hey, Ono.

03:40.080 --> 03:41.724
Let's ask him about
his spin thingie.

03:41.729 --> 03:43.355
Yo, Hadithi!

03:43.360 --> 03:44.457
Bunga!

03:44.462 --> 03:47.113
You can't just talk to Hadithi.

03:47.118 --> 03:49.550
He's the Raven Rescuer
from Red Rocks.

03:49.555 --> 03:52.152
The Starling Savior
at Summer Springs.

03:52.157 --> 03:55.316
Don't forget the Guardian
of the Great Egret Escape.

03:55.321 --> 03:58.261
Oh, I would never...
(GASPS)

03:58.266 --> 03:59.644
Uh, Bunga?

03:59.649 --> 04:02.097
Is Hadithi
actually talking to me?

04:02.102 --> 04:04.589
Indeed I am, young Egret.

04:04.594 --> 04:06.582
You seem to know a lot about me.

04:06.587 --> 04:09.415
Oh, I do, Hadithi.

04:09.420 --> 04:10.339
Sir.

04:10.344 --> 04:12.094
(CLEARS THROAT) In fact,

04:12.099 --> 04:14.665
I would have to say I'm your

04:15.779 --> 04:17.144
My biggest fan?

sure, young Egret?

(ANIMALS CHEERING)

06:16.129 --> 06:18.965
Thank you so much!

06:18.970 --> 06:22.922
You're the wind
beneath my wings!

06:22.927 --> 06:26.612
But you may just be
my biggest fan after all.

06:26.687 --> 06:27.785
Perhaps.

06:27.790 --> 06:28.777
But don't forget.

06:28.782 --> 06:31.588
You have fans all
over the Pride Lands.

06:31.593 --> 06:34.226
King Simba. Queen Nala.

06:34.231 --> 06:36.643
You honor me with your presence.

06:36.648 --> 06:40.010
We're glad your travels have brought
you back to the Pride Lands, Hadithi.

06:40.015 --> 06:42.799
Yes. Your return
has brought great joy

06:42.804 --> 06:44.269
all over the Savannah.

06:44.274 --> 06:45.437
Mom? Dad?

06:45.442 --> 06:47.299
You've heard of Hadithi?

06:47.304 --> 06:48.347
Oh, yes.

06:48.352 --> 06:51.319
Hadithi is a hero to animals
throughout the Pride Lands.

06:52.804 --> 06:57.510
We all know, Hadithi is a bird
who never thinks of himself.

06:57.515 --> 07:00.073
Especially when
an animal needs help.

07:00.078 --> 07:03.987
When a hero like Hadithi
returns to the Pride Lands,

07:03.992 --> 07:07.659
it is important for us
to mark the occasion.

07:07.664 --> 07:10.237
And this is why we'd like
to honor you at Pride Rock

07:10.242 --> 07:12.190
with a Royal Mud Print ceremony.

07:12.195 --> 07:14.432
A Royal Mud Print ceremony?

07:14.437 --> 07:15.517
For me?

07:15.522 --> 07:18.307
A Royal Mud Print ceremony!

07:18.312 --> 07:21.206
Un-Bunga-lievable!

07:21.211 --> 07:23.409
What's a Royal
Mud Print ceremony?

07:23.414 --> 07:25.799
Hadithi will press
his talons into wet mud!

07:25.804 --> 07:28.963
When it dries, his prints
will be preserved forever

07:28.968 --> 07:31.057
alongside those of other heroes!

07:31.062 --> 07:32.721
I've seen those prints!

07:32.726 --> 07:34.557
But I've never
seen the ceremony.

07:34.562 --> 07:38.487
(LAUGHS) I can't think of
anyone who deserves it more.

07:38.492 --> 07:40.463
And as Guest of Honor,

07:40.468 --> 07:43.503
it is tradition that you
share your great knowledge

07:43.508 --> 07:46.081
with a younger member
of the Pride lands.

07:46.086 --> 07:48.737
Now, who should it be?

07:48.742 --> 07:50.846
Dad, over here.
Him! Him!

07:50.851 --> 07:53.433
Ah, perhaps, young Ono.

07:53.438 --> 07:54.518
Me?

07:54.523 --> 07:58.110
Very well.
If that's your tradition.

07:58.115 --> 08:00.011
Is there anything else you need?

08:00.016 --> 08:02.930
Oh, that's very kind
of you, King Simba.

08:02.935 --> 08:04.918
But, I don't need much.

08:04.923 --> 08:05.949
Very well.

08:05.954 --> 08:09.987
Although, uh,
speaking of tradition,

08:10.187 --> 08:11.156
as guest of honor,

08:11.161 --> 08:15.412
I assume that you'll be building me
the traditional ceremonial nest?

08:15.417 --> 08:17.522
The ceremonial nest?

08:17.527 --> 08:19.164
Hmm. I've never
heard of that.

08:19.169 --> 08:22.100
But we've also never had
a mud print ceremony

08:22.105 --> 08:23.748
for an eagle before.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.170
That's true.

08:25.175 --> 08:27.088
Birds do these things
differently.

08:27.093 --> 08:29.041
The Lion Guard would be honored

08:29.046 --> 08:31.076
to build the traditional
ceremonial nest!

08:31.081 --> 08:32.990
Uh... Wouldn't we?

08:32.995 --> 08:34.232
Uh...

08:34.238 --> 08:35.955
Sure.
Honored.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.317
Then we shall see you at
the clearing by Pride Rock

08:38.322 --> 08:41.422
just before sundown
for the ceremony.

08:42.919 --> 08:46.329
Thank you, Lion Guard,
for your kind offer.

08:46.334 --> 08:49.149
Aw, what's a little
favor among heroes?

08:49.154 --> 08:53.642
I assume you know how to use the
proper leaves for the nest.

08:53.647 --> 08:55.657
The proper leaves?

08:55.662 --> 08:57.564
In keeping with tradition,

08:57.569 --> 08:59.610
the ceremonial nest
should be made of the leaves

08:59.615 --> 09:03.251
from the top of the tallest
tree in the land.

09:03.295 --> 09:04.315
Seriously?

09:04.320 --> 09:07.017
Well, I don't just make up
these traditions.

09:07.022 --> 09:10.361
It makes sense, the fronds
at the top are the softest.

09:10.366 --> 09:11.994
Fit for a hero.

09:11.999 --> 09:14.415
Exactly, Ono.

09:14.420 --> 09:17.017
Maybe you do know
what you're talking about.

09:17.022 --> 09:19.150
Oh, uh, I do?

09:19.155 --> 09:20.455
Of course, you do, Ono.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.868
And while Ono spends
time with Hadithi,

09:22.873 --> 09:24.924
the rest of us can go
get the special leaves.

09:24.929 --> 09:25.986
Right, guys?

09:25.991 --> 09:27.152
Uh.

09:27.157 --> 09:29.112
Maybe?
Sure we can!

09:29.117 --> 09:31.617
Just point me
to the tallest tree.

09:33.842 --> 09:37.042
It sure was nice of you to let
Ono stay with Hadithi.

09:37.047 --> 09:39.294
Shouldn't we be doing
more important things

09:39.299 --> 09:42.001
than fetching leaves
from the tallest tree?

09:42.006 --> 09:44.556
For some eagle
we've never heard of?

09:44.561 --> 09:47.049
(CHUCKLES) But my
Dad's heard of him.

09:47.054 --> 09:48.120
Yeah!

09:48.125 --> 09:50.011
And he's Ono's biggest hero!

09:50.016 --> 09:53.665
Right. So let's go find
that tallest tree.

09:53.670 --> 09:58.466
The higher you fly, the more
they'll look up to you.

09:58.502 --> 10:00.322
ALL: Ah.

10:00.327 --> 10:02.065
That's all well
and good for storks,

10:02.070 --> 10:04.245
but elephants don't fly.

10:04.250 --> 10:07.043
I think what Hadithi
is trying to say is,

10:07.048 --> 10:10.399
we all have challenges that require
us to rise above ourselves.

10:10.460 --> 10:12.277
To become better than we are.

10:12.282 --> 10:14.345
Ah. Thanks, Ono.

10:14.350 --> 10:16.337
Wise words, Hadithi.

10:16.342 --> 10:18.540
Indeed.

10:18.545 --> 10:21.681
KION: Maybe it wasn't such a
good idea to leave Ono behind.

10:21.686 --> 10:22.800

A-ha! Whoa!

10:33.203 --> 10:34.634
You guys should come up.

10:34.639 --> 10:37.059
I can see everything from here!

10:37.064 --> 10:39.587
Just get the leaves
and come down!

10:39.592 --> 10:41.958
But it's the tallest tree
in the Pride Lands.

10:41.963 --> 10:44.114
I can see Pride Rock.

10:44.119 --> 10:46.418
I can see Mekundu Cliffs.

10:46.423 --> 10:49.384
I can see the tallest tree
in the Pride Lands.

10:50.204 --> 10:51.492
Uh-oh.

10:51.497 --> 10:54.996
Did he just say he could see the
tallest tree in the Pride Lands?

10:55.001 --> 10:56.895
(GROANS) Yep.

10:56.900 --> 11:00.356
And everyone will
look up to you.

11:00.361 --> 11:01.747
ALL: Ah.

11:01.791 --> 11:03.762
Thank you for coming, everyone.

11:03.767 --> 11:08.233
And don't forget my Royal Mud Print
ceremony tonight at sundown.

11:08.238 --> 11:09.294
ALL: Hadithi.

11:09.299 --> 11:10.435
Hadithi!

11:10.440 --> 11:11.806
Hadithi!

11:11.848 --> 11:14.166
Everyone! Back off!

11:14.171 --> 11:17.523
Give Hadithi the
respect he deserves!

11:18.234 --> 11:20.063
Thank you, Ono.

11:20.068 --> 11:22.648
It seems you're a natural, too.

11:22.653 --> 11:23.998
I am?

11:24.003 --> 11:25.298
Me?

11:25.303 --> 11:30.322
In that case, do you think you
could show me the Hadithi Spin?

11:30.327 --> 11:34.079
Well, I'd rather not muss my
feathers so close to the ceremony.

11:34.084 --> 11:37.648
Why don't you show me, and I'll
tell you if you're doing it right.

11:37.653 --> 11:39.583
Uh, okay!

11:39.588 --> 11:41.313
Great!

11:44.317 --> 11:47.146
Okay. Here goes.

11:47.151 --> 11:49.375
Three mid-air loops
and a corkscrew.

11:49.380 --> 11:51.234
Hadithi!

11:51.239 --> 11:52.742
You watching?

11:52.747 --> 11:55.742
I sure am!
Give it all you got.

11:56.816 --> 11:58.343
One.

11:58.454 --> 11:59.887
Two.

12:00.157 --> 12:02.323
Three!

12:02.942 --> 12:05.648
Oof! Ahem!

12:05.653 --> 12:07.109
I, uh...

12:07.114 --> 12:10.828
I think possibly I forgot
to compensate for the wind.

12:10.833 --> 12:12.515
Well, that's your mistake,

12:12.520 --> 12:15.258
the wind always
compensates for me.

12:15.263 --> 12:17.359
Oh...

12:17.364 --> 12:19.923
Never mind.
Try it again.

12:19.928 --> 12:23.008
You'll see, Hadithi,
this time I'll get it!

12:28.251 --> 12:29.700
Almost there, little B.

12:29.705 --> 12:31.005
Ah!

12:31.786 --> 12:33.024
I got an idea.

12:33.029 --> 12:35.461
How about we put the
ceremonial nest right here?

12:35.466 --> 12:38.429
(CHUCKLES) I want
to sit right up front.

12:38.434 --> 12:40.593
Hey, birds only.

12:40.598 --> 12:42.915
But we're Hadithi fans too!

12:42.920 --> 12:45.961
It's okay. We'll find
another place to sit.

12:47.263 --> 12:49.461
That was very nice
of you, Mtoto.

12:49.466 --> 12:50.968
I don't mind, Beshte.

12:50.973 --> 12:54.270
After all, you're still
my number one hero!

12:54.275 --> 12:55.445
Huh.

12:55.450 --> 12:57.578
Lot of animals
want to see Hadithi.

12:57.583 --> 12:59.344
Huh. I guess.

12:59.349 --> 13:01.063
So, where is he?

13:01.151 --> 13:02.468
One.

13:02.473 --> 13:05.453
Two. Two and a half loops!

13:05.458 --> 13:06.613
Almost there!

13:06.618 --> 13:08.618
What do you think, Hadithi?

13:09.373 --> 13:10.906
Hadithi?

13:11.228 --> 13:13.291
Oh! Uh.

13:13.296 --> 13:15.867
Oh. Looked great, Ono.

13:16.133 --> 13:17.899
You weren't even watching.

13:17.904 --> 13:20.195
I'm sorry, but I have
to look my best!

13:20.200 --> 13:22.297
It wouldn't do for my fans
to have their hero show up

13:22.302 --> 13:24.773
looking like he just came
in from a windstorm!

13:24.778 --> 13:28.805
Although, it might make
me look even more heroic.

13:30.052 --> 13:32.890
One more try!
I bet I can do it!

13:32.895 --> 13:34.279
I doubt that.

13:34.284 --> 13:35.758
Time to go!

13:35.763 --> 13:38.679
What? But you said
I was a natural.

13:38.684 --> 13:41.273
A natural with the crowd.

13:41.278 --> 13:42.476
You give them what they want.

13:42.481 --> 13:44.256
You play them perfectly.

13:44.261 --> 13:45.357
Play them?

13:45.362 --> 13:46.570
What do you mean?

13:46.575 --> 13:49.523
You always tell them exactly
what they want to hear!

13:49.528 --> 13:50.750
I do?

13:50.755 --> 13:52.828
But, I'm just being honest.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.057

On the rocks just below.

14:08.645 --> 14:11.054
Klipspringers are
excellent climbers.

14:11.059 --> 14:13.251
They got up there,
I'm sure they can get down.

14:13.256 --> 14:15.265

They've got
the klipspringers cornered!

14:24.267 --> 14:26.320
A whole hyena clan?

14:26.325 --> 14:28.468
We can take 'em out
with the Hadithi Spin!

14:28.473 --> 14:31.907
Uh. Oh. Uh, I don't think
you're ready for that, Ono.

14:31.912 --> 14:33.765
And, I wouldn't want
you to get hurt.

Whoa!

20:21.958 --> 20:23.119
Come on, Hadithi!

20:23.124 --> 20:24.866
This is fun!

20:24.871 --> 20:28.144
(STAMMERS) Wait,
did he say "Hadithi"?

20:28.732 --> 20:31.002
ONO: (WHOOPING) Yeah.

20:31.007 --> 20:32.455
(ONO LAUGHING)

20:32.460 --> 20:33.422
<i>Poa!</i>

20:33.427 --> 20:35.183
Wow! Look at him go!

20:35.188 --> 20:38.735
I don't know who's more
impressive, Ono or Hadithi!

20:38.740 --> 20:39.821
I do!

20:39.826 --> 20:41.172
Go, Ono!

20:41.177 --> 20:43.577
Yeah! Go, Ono!

20:44.972 --> 20:48.285
Yes. Go, Ono.

20:50.453 --> 20:53.318
Whoa. I don't
feel so good!

20:53.323 --> 20:54.417
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

20:54.422 --> 20:58.023
I think I'm gonna lose my lunch!

20:58.028 --> 21:00.371
Fur brain! We all are!

21:00.376 --> 21:02.175
(SCREAMING)

21:05.484 --> 21:09.399
Who was that big guy
with the feathers?

21:09.404 --> 21:10.719
Don't you know nothin'?

21:10.724 --> 21:13.947
That was Hadithi,
the legendary eagle!

21:13.952 --> 21:16.266
We got beat by a legend?

21:16.271 --> 21:18.051
(LAUGHING)

21:18.056 --> 21:20.345
Oh, my gosh.
That's great!

(JANJA GROANS)

21:25.435 --> 21:28.253
I was supposed to pass
my wisdom on to you.

21:28.258 --> 21:29.680
But instead,

21:29.685 --> 21:32.673
you passed some wisdom onto me.

21:32.717 --> 21:34.798
You know why, kid?

21:34.918 --> 21:37.383
'Cause you're a natural.

21:37.388 --> 21:40.098
A natural hero.

21:40.103 --> 21:42.074
(ANIMALS CHEERING)

21:43.274 --> 21:45.347
