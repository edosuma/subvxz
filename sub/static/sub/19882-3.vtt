00:06.158 --> 00:08.824
Hey, Vic, you should take a look
at this, mate. It's a bullion heist.

00:08.866 --> 00:10.158
Do we have an idea whose gold this is?

00:10.199 --> 00:11.741
Yeah, we do. It's ours.

00:11.824 --> 00:14.490
I'll get them to share that
gold, one way or another.

00:14.491 --> 00:16.783
- So, what's going on?
- Saul Gold's going on.

00:16.824 --> 00:17.899
He's called a job on.

00:17.924 --> 00:18.991
You pick up my clients,

00:19.033 --> 00:20.658
the Heimels, from the airport.

00:20.699 --> 00:22.823
What else are we transporting
other than the Heimels, Mr. Gold?

00:22.824 --> 00:24.323
Diamonds. A fistful.

00:24.324 --> 00:27.324
Where can we have a
little fun around here?

00:27.408 --> 00:28.991
What kind of fun are you referring to?

00:29.074 --> 00:30.366
Who's heisted my diamonds?

00:30.408 --> 00:31.741
I don't know yet, Mr. Gold.

00:31.783 --> 00:33.783
I want my diamonds back in 48 hours,

00:33.824 --> 00:35.408
or I will cut off your cock.

00:42.033 --> 00:43.949
Oh Christ.

00:45.408 --> 00:47.574
How we gonna write this shit show up?

00:47.658 --> 00:50.491
Way it happened, Bob, is
we burst through the doors

00:50.533 --> 00:52.631
to be greeted by a crew
of hopped-up gangsters

00:52.656 --> 00:54.157
blazing lead in our general direction.

00:54.158 --> 00:55.616
What the f...!

00:56.616 --> 00:58.699
It was us... or them.

01:00.658 --> 01:01.658
Right.

01:03.324 --> 01:04.324
Us or them.

01:07.616 --> 01:10.574
Oh. Lads. Looks like
we've got a live one.

01:10.616 --> 01:12.533
I'll call in the paramedics.

01:12.574 --> 01:15.824
- What you do that for?
- Forty grand, Bob.

01:15.866 --> 01:18.116
Cost per prisoner per year.

01:18.158 --> 01:20.991
Now, say this shithead gets
20 at Her Majesty's pleasure.

01:21.033 --> 01:24.116
You're asking the taxpayer to cough
three-quarters of a million quid.

01:25.116 --> 01:26.531
That's unconscionable, mate.

01:28.991 --> 01:29.991
All right.

01:31.491 --> 01:33.399
Let's see what Vic Hill's been up to.

01:35.991 --> 01:37.098
Bingo.

01:37.590 --> 01:38.865
Bingo.

01:42.656 --> 01:44.495
Bang up job, boys.

01:46.824 --> 01:48.783
Gold must be worth millions.

01:48.824 --> 01:50.741
Gonna be front page news.

01:50.783 --> 01:52.908
We'll get commendations for this, gents.

01:54.561 --> 01:56.158
Sorry to be the one to
break it to you, Bob,

01:56.199 --> 01:58.908
but there'll be no medals or
marching parades for this one.

02:00.366 --> 02:02.658
- Why?
- Well...

02:02.699 --> 02:04.334
missus says she'll
stop making love to me

02:04.359 --> 02:05.762
if I don't buy her a fur coat.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.074

02:21.616 --> 02:24.657
You make a shit criminal
and a shit copper.

02:25.894 --> 02:28.323
What's left for you, Bob?

02:28.324 --> 02:31.659
Sod all! That's what's left for you.

03:21.657 --> 03:22.693
_

03:22.718 --> 03:24.783
How the hell did Castillo
know about the diamonds?

03:24.824 --> 03:26.908
Come on, Charlie. We're talking
about loose chat and strippers.

03:26.949 --> 03:28.908
Sonny probably owned the
joint. It takes one phone call.

03:33.991 --> 03:36.490
Let's just tell Saul
Gold who heisted him.

03:36.491 --> 03:37.990
He'll get the ice back

03:37.991 --> 03:41.408
and redecorate El Flamingo
with bits of Sonny's skull.

03:41.491 --> 03:44.957
But Sonny ain't Saul's
problem, is it? It's ours.

03:45.104 --> 03:47.658
We guaranteed delivery, so
we gotta sort this shit out.

03:47.699 --> 03:49.699
Well, bar selling selective body parts,

03:49.783 --> 03:51.574
we only have two viable options...

03:51.616 --> 03:53.741
either we fence some of the
gold and raise the cash...

03:54.741 --> 03:55.949
or retrieve the diamonds.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.533
Retrieval. Lotti Mott.

04:03.574 --> 04:05.408
She can work with us from the inside.

04:05.449 --> 04:07.866
We go in hard, we go in heavy,
and we light the place up.

04:07.908 --> 04:09.366
She's a hot mess.

04:09.408 --> 04:11.033
You need to wipe your glasses, pal.

04:11.074 --> 04:12.658
They've come over all misty.

04:12.699 --> 04:14.658
Yeah, son, if you've got any
better ideas, then share 'em.

04:14.699 --> 04:16.074
Yeah, we fence some of the gold...

04:16.158 --> 04:17.990
without sparking the enthusiasm

04:17.991 --> 04:19.709
of the local criminal fraternity.

04:20.866 --> 04:23.991
The girl working at
Saul's... she's pin sharp.

04:24.033 --> 04:27.491
She knows the business.
Chloe Koen is our ticket.

04:33.158 --> 04:34.658
I want those diamonds back.

04:36.158 --> 04:37.998
Let's take Lotti Mott
for a walk, shall we?

04:42.991 --> 04:44.866
Everything go to plan?

04:44.908 --> 04:47.866
What's your boy done with my diamonds?

04:47.908 --> 04:50.533
- Come again?
- Don't play the innocent with me, Vic.

04:51.616 --> 04:54.241
Your boy says that he got turned over,

04:54.283 --> 04:57.324
which as a result has put
me and, conversely, you

04:57.366 --> 05:00.074
a quarter-bar in the red.

05:00.158 --> 05:02.157
My boy wouldn't rip you off, Saul.

05:02.158 --> 05:04.457
He knows what's what. I'll
talk to him and get back to ya.

05:04.482 --> 05:06.783
You iron this proper now, Vic...

05:06.824 --> 05:10.783
or your boy will feel the sharp
end of my very sharp stick.

05:10.824 --> 05:15.283
Oh! Vic, in the meantime,

05:15.324 --> 05:17.657
all those privileges you
enjoy in that shithole

05:17.658 --> 05:19.241
that make your miserable existence

05:19.283 --> 05:21.823
marginally less miserable are revoked.

05:26.624 --> 05:28.332
What did you do, son?

05:28.991 --> 05:30.491
What did you do?

05:33.241 --> 05:35.783
So, you want to raid El Flamingo,

05:35.824 --> 05:37.541
get the stones back,

05:37.566 --> 05:39.766
and you want me to
work the thing for you

05:39.824 --> 05:42.364
- from the inside?
- That's the short of it.

05:46.158 --> 05:47.533
And what's in it for me?

05:47.616 --> 05:50.116
- Well, we cut you in.
- Diamonds?

05:50.158 --> 05:52.490
No, no, no, no. The ice
goes back to Saul Gold.

05:52.491 --> 05:54.449
- Then what?
- Come on, you know what, Lotti.

05:54.491 --> 05:56.491
I want to hear him say it.

05:58.658 --> 06:00.783
- Gold.
- I knew it.

06:00.824 --> 06:03.158
- I knew it!
- Will you shut up?

06:04.366 --> 06:05.991
Listen, no word to anybody, all right?

06:06.033 --> 06:08.158
This is some seriously heavy shit.

06:08.199 --> 06:09.574
This is some heavy shit, all right.

06:09.616 --> 06:11.188
All right.

06:11.307 --> 06:12.832
So you up for it or not?

06:13.908 --> 06:17.241
- Equal partners.
- No. No.

06:18.658 --> 06:20.851
You're a junior partner. That's it.

06:24.158 --> 06:26.158
Good luck with Saul Gold, boys.

06:28.824 --> 06:29.824
All right.

06:32.324 --> 06:33.324
All right.

06:34.616 --> 06:35.699
Equal partners.

06:42.574 --> 06:43.574
Hate 'Em.

06:45.116 --> 06:46.116
Hate 'Em!

06:47.408 --> 06:48.699
- What?
- Phone's on the piss.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.199
- You top it up?
- Yeah, last week.

06:50.241 --> 06:52.783
- Should be fully loaded.
- Well, it's not bloody working.

06:58.921 --> 07:00.510
Mine's gone down as well.

07:08.324 --> 07:11.449
Come on. Come on.

07:23.060 --> 07:24.227
Bingo.

07:26.949 --> 07:29.116
What you got there, Fink? Hmm?

07:29.158 --> 07:32.241
Uhh... fraud case. Luxury goods,

07:32.283 --> 07:34.354
knockoff Harrods hampers.

07:34.908 --> 07:36.658
The Harrods Hamper Caper.

07:36.699 --> 07:40.283
- Yeah.
- Just your speed, Bob.

07:40.324 --> 07:41.699
You know, a little birdy told me

07:41.741 --> 07:43.616
you spoke with the armored truck driver.

07:44.908 --> 07:46.408
- Truck driver?
- Mmm.

07:46.491 --> 07:50.657
This bullion robbery is
strictly Flying Squad business.

07:50.658 --> 07:52.375
- We're on it.
- Understood.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.101
You're on it, Teri.

07:55.533 --> 07:59.033
And if I found out that you've been
tailing our investigation again,

07:59.116 --> 08:02.324
I'll kick you square in those
raisins that you call bollocks.

08:03.783 --> 08:04.991
Message received.

08:06.116 --> 08:07.408
Loud and clear.

08:20.158 --> 08:21.741
Hey.

08:21.783 --> 08:23.199
Good boy.

08:58.491 --> 08:59.783
Hello.

09:21.504 --> 09:22.620
These are staff quarters.

09:22.645 --> 09:25.658
Strictly off-limits.
The party's upstairs.

09:25.741 --> 09:28.533
- I'm not here for the party.
- You're not?

09:30.077 --> 09:33.281
Uhh... what are you doing?

09:33.306 --> 09:36.212
- Who are you?
- D.I. Fink.

09:36.949 --> 09:40.033
Well, will you kindly
state your business, sir?

09:40.074 --> 09:43.578
I'm looking for a pair
of monogrammed slippers.

09:43.603 --> 09:47.603
Sir, I don't know what
you are referring to.

09:47.783 --> 09:50.199
I would like to see
proper identification.

10:04.023 --> 10:05.190
Shift.

10:17.074 --> 10:19.533
Oh my gosh.

10:23.068 --> 10:24.443
Hello, gents.

10:24.485 --> 10:26.526
This is what you're up against.

11:03.775 --> 11:05.525
I left something in the safe room.

11:05.567 --> 11:07.109
I can't let you in there, Lotti.

11:11.109 --> 11:12.525
Oh, Manny.

11:14.359 --> 11:15.900
Please do one little thing for me.

11:17.192 --> 11:19.192
You're always there when I need you.

11:23.025 --> 11:24.692
Could you open up the safe room?

11:26.525 --> 11:28.359
Think I left my knickers inside.

11:30.109 --> 11:31.775
We were...

11:31.817 --> 11:33.524
Sonny likes to...

11:33.525 --> 11:36.609
in the safe room... for the cameras.

11:36.650 --> 11:39.275
All the angles, if you know what I mean.

11:57.775 --> 11:59.609
Mmm!

12:00.775 --> 12:02.442
Don't be in such a rush, Manny.

12:02.525 --> 12:05.841
I'll come and find you later
and you can fill your boots.

12:07.192 --> 12:11.150
Must've left my knickers
somewhere else. Laters!

12:11.192 --> 12:13.817
Thank you for that. That
was... that was helpful.

12:15.351 --> 12:19.185
I just gave you the layout
to Sonny Castillo's safe room.

12:19.734 --> 12:21.859
Now, what's the plan?

12:21.900 --> 12:23.859
Well, that's something that
we need to discuss internally.

12:26.567 --> 12:27.567
Without you.

12:31.067 --> 12:32.361
Your boss is a dick.

12:32.386 --> 12:35.609
Well, he isn't my boss. He's my mate.

12:35.650 --> 12:37.192
- Cheers, bro.
- Shut up.

12:37.234 --> 12:40.601
Well, your mate... that bosses
everyone around is a dick.

12:42.692 --> 12:44.900
If you want to turn Sonny Castillo
over, you're gonna need me.

12:44.984 --> 12:46.900
You're gonna need me in all the way.

12:46.984 --> 12:48.650
I can work this thing from the inside

12:48.692 --> 12:50.859
whilst you lot play silly safe-crackers.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.359
She's not wrong, Al.

12:54.859 --> 12:56.775
And you can keep Sonny
distracted, can ya?

12:57.942 --> 12:59.109
What do you think?

13:16.109 --> 13:18.067
Boys, mark this down.

13:18.109 --> 13:20.525
If you're not seen back in
here in less than two weeks,

13:20.567 --> 13:22.625
send Brian round and
drag him out to 'em yard.

13:23.704 --> 13:25.358
You have to cut your
hair regular, you know?

13:47.775 --> 13:50.442
I'm after a fella called...

13:50.484 --> 13:52.900
Windrush... Windrush.

13:52.942 --> 13:55.400
I hear he can help with pest control.

13:55.442 --> 13:58.484
Ooh. Windrush isn't here.

14:00.525 --> 14:02.067
You can take Henry.

14:10.650 --> 14:11.650
Okay.

14:12.650 --> 14:13.743
I'll take Henry.

14:33.361 --> 14:34.859
_

14:34.884 --> 14:37.109
- _
- Shit.

14:37.150 --> 14:38.859
What you wearing those for?

14:38.900 --> 14:41.025
Lucky slippers.

14:41.067 --> 14:42.216
Relax, boys.

14:42.241 --> 14:44.525
Come on then.

14:44.567 --> 14:46.918
What you done now, Charlie?

14:46.943 --> 14:49.192
Oh, I just forgot my dad's birthday.

14:49.234 --> 14:52.031
Nothing a bottle of scotch wouldn't fix.

14:57.525 --> 14:59.650
We're gonna need a proper safe-cracker.

14:59.734 --> 15:01.778
Yeah, all right. Where
we gonna find one of them?

15:04.609 --> 15:05.859
Come through.

15:21.984 --> 15:23.664
Bollocks.

15:24.560 --> 15:25.878
This is medieval, this is.

15:25.903 --> 15:29.051
Now they're depriving us
of basic human necessities.

15:29.400 --> 15:31.191
Got a long reach, this
Saul Gold, isn't he, eh?

15:31.192 --> 15:34.192
He's not bloody God, Hate
'Em. It's just a coincidence.

15:34.234 --> 15:35.778
Really?

15:35.803 --> 15:37.049
Got a visitor, Mr. H.

15:39.067 --> 15:40.192
A visitor?

15:42.859 --> 15:45.025
Ah, there he is.

15:45.109 --> 15:47.650
The prodigal son.

15:47.692 --> 15:50.525
- You all right?
- Well, I'm pressed, Albert,

15:50.567 --> 15:53.275
if you'd like to know.
I'm extremely pressed.

15:54.942 --> 15:56.900
Saul Gold, quarter of a bar in rocks,

15:56.942 --> 15:59.192
on our watch. Strike a note?

15:59.234 --> 16:01.179
There were some
extenuating circumstances.

16:06.275 --> 16:08.123
We got rolled.

16:08.148 --> 16:10.667
You're a Hill. We do
not get fucking rolled!

16:10.692 --> 16:11.839
And you've done 15 years

16:11.864 --> 16:13.484
'cause you didn't pay your
council tax, is that right?

16:13.525 --> 16:15.858
You are clueless as to the repercussions

16:15.859 --> 16:17.525
of your extenuating circumstances.

16:17.567 --> 16:19.191
Saul Gold is a murdering bastard,

16:19.192 --> 16:21.358
and you and I are both nose
deep in the shitter, Son.

16:21.359 --> 16:23.345
- I'm going to handle it.
- Are you now?

16:27.942 --> 16:29.212
I need something from you.

16:30.609 --> 16:31.900
Do you want me to wipe your ass?

16:35.856 --> 16:38.149
I need you to put me in
touch with a safe-cracker.

16:39.734 --> 16:40.734
I need the Ace.

16:42.775 --> 16:44.961
Norman Gordon?

16:49.859 --> 16:52.057
Last I heard, he was
blasting out gangster tours

16:52.082 --> 16:53.716
on Limehouse Lane for a living.

17:00.025 --> 17:03.150
Oh, is that it? No chat about
the football or the weather or...

17:03.192 --> 17:04.579
where is my hug?

17:04.604 --> 17:06.531
I've gotta go. I'll see ya later.

17:07.692 --> 17:10.983
Oi. Don't you go digging that
hole any fucking deeper, son.

17:12.067 --> 17:13.067
Oi!

17:13.108 --> 17:14.775
And on this very spot...

17:15.983 --> 17:18.358
just outside the Crown and Anchor Pub,

17:18.400 --> 17:23.275
was the infamous scene of
Jack Pot and Regis McLemore's

17:23.317 --> 17:26.025
first scrap with the Old Bill!

17:26.067 --> 17:29.025
This incident led the boys to realize...

17:31.234 --> 17:33.275
Led the boys to realize...

17:35.900 --> 17:37.817
So began a life of crime.

17:37.859 --> 17:40.150
Piss off! Out of the way, Granddad!

17:50.025 --> 17:54.360
Last time I saw you, you had
a snotty nose and scabby knees.

17:55.346 --> 17:57.160
Now look at you, Albert.

17:57.185 --> 17:58.831
- All grown up.
- Yeah?

17:58.856 --> 18:01.845
Come on, it's been a while
since I've had scabby knees.

18:02.349 --> 18:03.558
How's your mom holding up?

18:03.583 --> 18:05.641
Yeah, she's all right. You
know Lily, holding it down.

18:07.025 --> 18:09.079
Not easy, being on her own.

18:09.104 --> 18:12.187
Raising a kid and husband locked away...

18:12.525 --> 18:14.525
it takes its toll a marriage.

18:15.456 --> 18:17.853
They... they all right?

18:17.878 --> 18:19.573
Vic and Lily?

18:21.984 --> 18:22.984
Yeah.

18:27.942 --> 18:31.770
Tell me, there been much... demand
for your services as of late?

18:31.795 --> 18:35.234
Pfft! What? For an analog
impresario in the digital age?

18:35.275 --> 18:38.775
No, I've long been supplanted
by the hacker whiz kid.

18:38.817 --> 18:41.150
- Ah.
- Effing new school guys.

18:41.192 --> 18:44.617
See... I have an expertise that...

18:44.642 --> 18:47.103
nobody seems to have the patience for.

18:51.275 --> 18:53.900
Yeah, but it turns
out I may have a job...

18:55.025 --> 18:57.109
for your specialist expertise, Norman.

19:10.359 --> 19:12.317
- Steady as he goes.
- Mmm.

19:50.650 --> 19:52.692
Ah.

19:52.775 --> 19:55.025
I've only got 20 quid on me.

19:57.025 --> 19:58.692
I don't want your pocket change.

20:00.234 --> 20:01.234
Tell me...

20:02.775 --> 20:05.484
where are your slippers, boy?

20:05.525 --> 20:07.985
Slippers? What are you talking
about? Who the hell are you?

20:09.484 --> 20:10.817
D.I. Fink.

20:10.859 --> 20:12.442
I know what you did.

20:12.484 --> 20:15.358
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

20:15.383 --> 20:18.277
No? Oh...

20:18.278 --> 20:20.691
I think you do.

20:20.692 --> 20:23.525
I don't know about any slippers,
but I do know my rights,

20:23.567 --> 20:26.192
so either arrest me or piss off.

20:32.887 --> 20:34.494
You know your rights, do ya?

20:34.525 --> 20:36.525
- What about my rights?
- Let me go!

20:36.609 --> 20:38.919
Video clip has a male, 5'10,

20:38.944 --> 20:41.775
wearing the monogrammed
slippers of the Cavendish Clan

20:41.817 --> 20:45.025
at the site of an armored
truck heist two days ago.

20:46.150 --> 20:47.609
You're Albert Hill's mate,

20:47.650 --> 20:51.775
a wannabe gangster in
a little silly bow tie.

20:55.109 --> 20:56.859
I want that gold, boy.

20:58.900 --> 21:00.775
And if you don't bring it to me...

21:02.192 --> 21:03.442
I will come for it.

21:47.025 --> 21:50.484
Eddie? We need more ribbon
for the prison orders.

21:52.817 --> 21:54.984
Governor's wife loves the ivory lace.

22:00.150 --> 22:02.942
These bi-weekly palm greasers
are hell on inventory.

22:09.484 --> 22:10.484
Oh.

22:14.900 --> 22:16.692
Albert must've bust his chain.

22:20.567 --> 22:22.025
Just this way, sir.

22:27.567 --> 22:30.025
- So sorry.
- What happened to you?

22:30.067 --> 22:32.900
Mugger. I fended them off.

22:32.984 --> 22:36.359
- Awful.
- Yeah, it was... it was nothing.

22:42.997 --> 22:45.359
Oh, thank God.

22:45.400 --> 22:47.609
Those gold ingots were
just enough to cover it.

22:47.650 --> 22:50.268
Oh. You managed to fence them?

22:50.293 --> 22:52.041
Indeed.

22:52.859 --> 22:55.734
- Run into any problems with that?
- Out-of-town connection.

22:55.775 --> 22:59.075
- Won't come back around.
- Oh. Well played, Ms. Koen.

22:59.984 --> 23:02.400
I'll get this. Business expense.

23:02.442 --> 23:05.024
Oh. Are we... so, we're
in business together?

23:05.025 --> 23:08.442
Well, that would depend on if
you guys had any more to offer.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.731
What if I told you...

23:12.525 --> 23:15.400
we have substantially more to offer?

23:15.425 --> 23:17.234
Mmm! I like the sound of that.

23:17.317 --> 23:18.859
And Saul?

23:18.942 --> 23:21.942
How would he feel with
such an involvement?

23:21.984 --> 23:24.279
I could work as an
independent contractor

23:24.304 --> 23:25.879
for this particular commission.

23:27.234 --> 23:30.067
It's on me. Business expense.

23:46.942 --> 23:48.691
Lily? It's me.

23:48.692 --> 23:50.191
- Can you hear me?
- Just about.

23:50.192 --> 23:52.234
Sounds like a bus
station. Where are you?

23:52.317 --> 23:54.524
I'm on a landline, so
mind your "P's" and "Q's."

23:54.525 --> 23:56.900
What's happened to the mobile?

23:56.984 --> 23:59.525
They put a squeeze on my amenities.

23:59.567 --> 24:02.359
Listen, are you still sending the posies

24:02.442 --> 24:04.609
- to those that matter on the inside?
- Yeah, of course.

24:04.650 --> 24:07.189
Two bouquets a week. Bleeding us dry.

24:07.616 --> 24:10.859
If my sweeteners aren't sweet enough,
maybe we should just call it a day.

24:10.900 --> 24:13.442
You've only got a few
months left on your sentence.

24:13.484 --> 24:14.645
You can do that standing on your head.

24:14.670 --> 24:16.192
Oi! You lot!

24:16.234 --> 24:18.067
Can it or I'll stripe the lot of ya!

24:21.817 --> 24:24.581
- You were saying, my sweet?
- You're out soon, yeah?

24:25.734 --> 24:27.862
Don't get gate fever.

24:27.887 --> 24:29.205
Head down and behave, yeah?

24:30.192 --> 24:31.692
Understood?

24:31.734 --> 24:33.191
Vic, do you hear me?

24:33.192 --> 24:35.900
Oi! Shut it! Shut it!

24:37.192 --> 24:40.400
- Vic?
- Loud and clear, my angel.

24:40.484 --> 24:42.442
Loud and clear.

24:56.067 --> 24:57.692
So, what are you after, Billy boy?

24:57.734 --> 24:59.067
Your job, pal.

25:17.650 --> 25:19.692
It's open.

25:24.442 --> 25:25.484
All right, then.

26:07.817 --> 26:08.984
Oh shit.

26:20.609 --> 26:22.109
Hello, big boy.

26:24.734 --> 26:26.359
What a sweet ass, huh?

26:30.734 --> 26:32.358
I'll leave this one with you

26:32.359 --> 26:35.524
- while I keep Sonny occupied.
- Come on!

26:38.817 --> 26:40.025
Lotti!

26:44.025 --> 26:45.900
Bubbles with your bubbles, baby.

26:48.025 --> 26:49.025
What's all this?

26:51.525 --> 26:53.942
We've been fighting too much.

26:53.984 --> 26:56.525
I thought we should make up.

26:56.567 --> 26:59.192
- Come here, baby.
- Baby, you promised.

26:59.234 --> 27:01.067
- Games first.
- Games first.

27:21.192 --> 27:22.650
Okay, baby!

27:23.734 --> 27:25.234
I'll set up the tiles!

27:34.984 --> 27:36.442
Let's get 'em good, Charlie.

27:42.192 --> 27:43.609
Norman.

27:44.650 --> 27:47.395
Norman. Norman!

27:57.192 --> 27:58.192
What are you doing?

27:59.400 --> 28:01.047
Just a sharpener.

28:01.072 --> 28:02.424
Dials in the fingers.

28:02.484 --> 28:04.900
Right, yeah. Norman,
we've got a safe to crack.

28:04.984 --> 28:06.692
I don't think I can, Albert.

28:06.734 --> 28:08.514
Wait a minute. Right. Come here.

28:08.539 --> 28:10.727
Come down here. Come here, Norman.

28:15.525 --> 28:17.109
You're not sure about what exactly?

28:18.942 --> 28:20.109
Who've I been kidding?

28:21.400 --> 28:24.360
- I'm a rusty gun. Past my sell-by date.
- Okay.

28:24.385 --> 28:27.150
I thought I had one good one left in me,

28:27.192 --> 28:29.875
but it turns out I am just a mug

28:29.900 --> 28:32.828
flogging two-bob gangster tours.

28:57.484 --> 28:58.754
Come on!

29:25.400 --> 29:27.984
Woo! Come on!

29:28.025 --> 29:29.859
Come on, you little prick! Come on!

29:36.025 --> 29:38.150
- Come on, you pikey!
- Come on then!

29:43.192 --> 29:47.817
When I win, I'm gonna
eat you like a ripe mango.

29:47.859 --> 29:49.692
If our relationship's going to last,

29:49.734 --> 29:51.859
we need common interests.

29:51.900 --> 29:55.442
Oh, we've got common interests.

29:55.484 --> 29:59.033
Uh-uh. Focus on the game, baby.

30:07.692 --> 30:10.067
My dad used to tell me stories
about you when I was a kid.

30:10.150 --> 30:12.525
- Mmm?
- Yeah.

30:12.567 --> 30:14.650
He said there wasn't a
lock you couldn't pick

30:14.692 --> 30:16.512
or a safe that wouldn't
yield to your mastery.

30:16.537 --> 30:17.798
Huh.

30:19.775 --> 30:21.025
You were my hero.

30:22.650 --> 30:25.150
I drew a comic strip about
you for my school project.

30:28.942 --> 30:30.317
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:30.359 --> 30:34.359
"Norman 'The Ace' Gordon," I called it.

30:34.400 --> 30:36.817
"Steady as he goes."

30:36.859 --> 30:39.734
- Norman "The Ace" Gordon.
- Yeah, and that's you.

30:39.775 --> 30:42.609
You are Norman "The Ace" Gordon,

30:42.692 --> 30:44.025
King of the safe-crackers,

30:45.025 --> 30:47.609
returning for one last caper.

30:49.400 --> 30:51.858
Now...

30:51.859 --> 30:55.485
go out there and secure your place
in criminal folklore... forever.

30:55.818 --> 30:58.500
- Eh?
- Let's crack this bastard!

30:58.525 --> 30:59.978
Your will, I say. Come on.

31:07.275 --> 31:10.156
- Another bottle.
- Just play the tiles,

31:10.984 --> 31:13.081
and then I'll get you anything you want.

31:16.484 --> 31:17.484
Okay.

31:25.400 --> 31:26.859
- You all right?
- I bloody got him.

31:46.525 --> 31:48.150
Fuck me. That's a big 'un.

31:55.025 --> 31:57.317
Right, well, you crack on Norman.
I'll be back in a minute, eh?

32:04.567 --> 32:08.359
You see, some fools are always
punching above their weight.

32:08.400 --> 32:12.109
And sometimes some wankers
never see it coming.

32:17.192 --> 32:19.734
Jesus. Well, help me up.

32:24.359 --> 32:25.859
Told you I had it covered, Al.

32:29.817 --> 32:30.817
You're welcome, Billy.

32:45.734 --> 32:48.859
- Oh. Twat.
- Me.

32:48.900 --> 32:50.442
Go on in, drag him out.

33:08.264 --> 33:09.549
How we doing, Norman?

33:13.317 --> 33:15.900
Norman "The Ace" Gordon.

33:32.109 --> 33:33.192
Bollocks!

33:35.234 --> 33:36.534
What is that?

33:36.559 --> 33:39.024
Uhh... piece of cake, son.

33:39.025 --> 33:41.025
Leave it with me.

33:44.942 --> 33:46.484
Wakey, wakey, Johnny boy.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.572
Oh! What?

33:48.597 --> 33:50.131
We've got a problem.

34:05.359 --> 34:07.109
Bananagrams!

34:14.192 --> 34:15.400
What the fuck?

34:20.192 --> 34:21.317
Shit.

34:39.192 --> 34:40.775
Oh bloody hell.

34:41.984 --> 34:44.192
Norman! Norman!

34:47.025 --> 34:49.442
Get out of here, Albert! I'm done for!

34:49.484 --> 34:53.525
Nobody turns over Sonny Castillo!

34:55.400 --> 34:56.400
Run.

34:56.442 --> 34:57.942
Go!

35:09.650 --> 35:11.359
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

35:12.817 --> 35:16.400
Bastards!

35:33.900 --> 35:35.691
Well, that went well, didn't it?

35:35.692 --> 35:37.109
Why did he try and blow the doors?

35:37.192 --> 35:38.775
I told him... I told him no explosives!

35:38.859 --> 35:40.234
What are we going to do about him?

35:40.275 --> 35:41.692
We'll have to go back in.

36:03.484 --> 36:05.150
- Hate 'Em.
- What?

36:05.192 --> 36:09.650
Where's our friendly screw
with my hot water bottie?

36:09.692 --> 36:12.025
Should've been here a half hour
ago. Do you want me to have a word?

36:12.067 --> 36:14.359
No. I've got this one.

36:15.609 --> 36:18.400
Vic. Vic. Oi! Vic, where you going?

36:24.067 --> 36:26.691
Oi. Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi!

36:26.692 --> 36:29.692
What's the crack then?
Where's my hot water bottie?

36:29.734 --> 36:31.192
You forget about me, eh?

36:31.275 --> 36:33.275
Listen, Mr. H. There's
been a change in protocol,

36:33.317 --> 36:35.442
a crackdown on liberties.
Nothing to be done.

36:35.484 --> 36:37.275
Don't be silly, Bert.

36:37.317 --> 36:38.858
There's always something to be done.

36:38.859 --> 36:40.817
Orders from up on high.

36:40.859 --> 36:42.609
Now, be a chap, take it on the chin,

36:42.650 --> 36:45.234
and get back in your cell sharpish.

36:45.275 --> 36:46.417
I'm Vic Hill!

36:46.442 --> 36:48.650
I own this wing and every slag on it!

36:48.692 --> 36:50.775
Riot squad, feed through.

37:09.025 --> 37:10.692
Tried to warn you, Mr. H.

37:12.692 --> 37:16.484
Prisoner 42718, Hill, return
to your cell immediately.

37:16.525 --> 37:18.192
- Or what?
- Or we are authorized

37:18.275 --> 37:20.150
to use reasonable force
to ensure you comply.

37:20.192 --> 37:22.067
Please, Mr. H. Do as he says.

37:22.109 --> 37:23.942
Jog on, or you'll catch it first.

37:23.984 --> 37:26.150
- Wrap him up, boys.
- Come on, you slags!

37:29.734 --> 37:31.942
Come on, slag! I'll kill the lot of you!

37:31.984 --> 37:34.317
Striking a screw! You know
where that's gonna send ya!

37:34.359 --> 37:36.900
Come on, I'll kill the lot
of ya! Come on! Come on!

37:36.942 --> 37:40.024
I'll kill the lot of ya!
Come on! Come on, you slag!

37:40.025 --> 37:42.734
I'll kill ya! Kill them all!

37:44.025 --> 37:46.358
Come on, you slag!

37:46.359 --> 37:47.817
Come on!

37:47.859 --> 37:50.650
Now then, 42718,

37:50.692 --> 37:52.199
contrary to popular belief,

37:52.224 --> 37:55.109
I am a man with a
generous and giving nature.

37:55.150 --> 37:56.419
Bollocks to ya!

37:56.444 --> 37:58.333
You just attacked a
prison guard, Mr. Hill.

37:59.451 --> 38:01.167
We don't take that kind
of behavior lightly.

38:01.192 --> 38:03.831
Now, it's either the Shitter...

38:04.150 --> 38:07.317
in which your punishment will
be of the digestive variety.

38:07.359 --> 38:10.609
Or the Sleeper,

38:10.650 --> 38:13.150
in which you will slip
into a vegetable state

38:13.192 --> 38:14.942
with your tongue dripping off your face.

38:16.316 --> 38:17.567
Give me the Sleeper, you bastard.

38:17.609 --> 38:20.109
Ah, the Sleeper.

38:20.186 --> 38:23.436
Are you sure? The side
effects can be a bit... mental.

38:23.525 --> 38:25.525
Give it to me! Ah!

38:46.234 --> 38:48.359
Sleep tight, dickhead.

38:52.759 --> 38:54.775
Ah, the Sleeper.

38:54.817 --> 38:57.234
Are you sure?

38:57.275 --> 39:01.525
The side effects can be a bit... mental.

39:01.567 --> 39:03.192
Give it to me!

39:03.234 --> 39:06.191
Sleep tight, dickhead.

39:08.086 --> 39:10.091
Who you working with, old man?

39:15.025 --> 39:16.567
You'll never crack me.

39:34.859 --> 39:36.931
Forget about him, boss.

39:36.956 --> 39:40.164
It was Lotti. She tipped 'em off.

39:58.067 --> 39:59.858
- Oh, son. Hello.
- Hi, Mom.

39:59.859 --> 40:01.109
- Hello.
- Mrs. H.

40:01.150 --> 40:03.275
Hello, hello, hello.

40:03.317 --> 40:05.192
Albert. A moment.

40:10.484 --> 40:12.734
- What's up?
- Eddie found...

40:14.192 --> 40:16.984
Found what?

40:19.650 --> 40:24.025
Uh, he found some more plant
food, so we're good on inventory.

40:24.067 --> 40:26.609
All right. Good.

40:31.567 --> 40:34.400
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah. Why?

40:34.484 --> 40:36.525
Remember, I'm here if you need me, yeah?

40:36.550 --> 40:38.258
Yeah, I know.

40:44.859 --> 40:46.817
- Get him out of there!
- He's dead!

40:47.290 --> 40:50.484
Shut up!

40:50.525 --> 40:52.859
We are gonna get Norman out, 'cause
a Hill does not leave a man behind.

40:52.900 --> 40:54.991
- All right?
- Thank you.

40:55.016 --> 40:56.098
Then I've gotta get straight with Saul,

40:56.123 --> 40:57.405
'cause I'm gonna end up a bloody eunuch.

40:57.430 --> 40:59.053
We're getting squeezed
from every direction.

40:59.078 --> 41:00.967
We need find a way to
move some of this gold

41:00.992 --> 41:02.625
to raise the cash to pay off Saul.

41:02.650 --> 41:04.399
Actually, I... I can help you with that.

41:04.424 --> 41:05.552
Go on.

41:05.577 --> 41:08.285
- Is this bad timing?
- Right on cue.

41:09.442 --> 41:11.775
- What is she doing here?
- Just... she can help us out.

41:11.859 --> 41:13.192
I can fence your gold.

41:14.697 --> 41:16.150
How does she know about the gold?

41:16.192 --> 41:17.900
How the hell does she know
about the gold, Charlie?

41:17.984 --> 41:19.900
Look, someone had to take action, okay?

41:19.984 --> 41:24.817
You're 24 hours from the pickle
jar. Just hear her out, Al.

41:24.859 --> 41:27.317
You know there's not a fence in town
willing to take on that kind of heat.

41:27.359 --> 41:28.942
Who said anything about staying local?

41:29.942 --> 41:31.359
Your passports up-to-date?

41:35.317 --> 41:37.495
- Passports?
- Where we going?

41:38.109 --> 41:39.109
New York.
