WEBVTT

01:29.112 --> 01:32.216
I thought that we could
build our nest high up...

01:33.751 --> 01:34.852
in the trees.

01:38.322 --> 01:40.323
Fly away, like birds...

01:42.760 --> 01:44.295
to the mountains.

04:36.800 --> 04:39.002
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes.

04:39.235 --> 04:41.036
Oh, we have
so many already.

05:40.096 --> 05:42.532
Remember
the day when we first met?

05:44.500 --> 05:46.036
You were shy like now.

05:48.572 --> 05:49.673
I remember.

05:51.375 --> 05:52.910
That motorcycle.

05:55.579 --> 05:57.180
My best dress.

06:05.723 --> 06:07.124
You looked at me...

06:10.127 --> 06:11.496
and I knew.

06:20.437 --> 06:22.507
How simple life was then.

06:27.810 --> 06:31.048
It seemed no trouble
could reach our valley.

06:36.353 --> 06:38.222
We lived above the clouds.

06:53.937 --> 06:56.204
My sister
came to live with us.

06:56.206 --> 06:57.708
He likes you.

07:17.728 --> 07:19.297
We had our home.

07:24.767 --> 07:25.969
Your mother,

07:28.605 --> 07:29.940
our family,

07:35.413 --> 07:36.614
our village,

07:39.649 --> 07:41.017
Radegund.

09:31.562 --> 09:33.431
Ah!

10:26.716 --> 10:27.918
Dear Fani,

10:29.285 --> 10:32.889
warm greetings to you
from your Franz in training.

10:34.291 --> 10:35.225
This week,

10:35.424 --> 10:36.459
I have things easy.

10:38.062 --> 10:40.663
In the mornings,
riding on a motorcycle.

10:42.131 --> 10:43.699
For me,
it's entertaining.

10:43.701 --> 10:45.069
Hello, mountains!

10:47.772 --> 10:50.074
I would love
to hear your singing again.

10:50.874 --> 10:52.475
Hello, sun!

10:52.876 --> 10:55.311
I'm looking forward
to our reunion.

11:03.287 --> 11:04.555
I met a fellow here.

11:05.455 --> 11:06.653
His name is Waldland.

11:06.655 --> 11:09.523
- How are you doing this?
- Well...

11:09.525 --> 11:10.825
In two months of training...

11:10.827 --> 11:12.126
No pretense about him.

11:12.128 --> 11:14.496
I wish that
I could be a little mouse

11:14.498 --> 11:15.564
In the cornfield

11:15.566 --> 11:16.700
Always smiling.

11:16.966 --> 11:19.368
And I
would be out there in the...

11:19.370 --> 11:21.104
Sometimes I wish

11:21.604 --> 11:24.839
I could be a little bird...

12:14.657 --> 12:16.093
My dear husband,

12:19.361 --> 12:21.197
they say that
France has surrendered.

12:24.868 --> 12:26.637
They're
sending farmers home...

12:29.340 --> 12:30.574
for now at least.

12:35.613 --> 12:36.914
Is it true?

12:44.754 --> 12:46.222
Sister's lonely.

12:48.725 --> 12:50.995
I wish
she had someone like you.

12:56.666 --> 12:58.168
We could use you here.

12:59.870 --> 13:01.071
To break in the calf.

13:09.779 --> 13:11.381
The harvest comes nearer.

13:14.985 --> 13:16.687
We burned the bad weeds.

13:37.907 --> 13:40.177
I got some piglets
from Mossbauer.

13:42.546 --> 13:43.614
Four weeks old.

13:54.124 --> 13:55.960
With warm greetings
to you...

13:58.061 --> 13:59.530
Your loving wife,

14:02.365 --> 14:03.334
Fani.

15:04.124 --> 15:04.660
Oh, my wife,

15:10.332 --> 15:12.535
what's happened to our country?

15:17.307 --> 15:19.043
To the land we love?

17:31.775 --> 17:32.974
Where are the kids?

17:32.976 --> 17:34.344
Inside.

18:10.380 --> 18:12.916
Oh,
Papa's coming for you!

20:06.829 --> 20:07.963
What is it?

20:14.371 --> 20:15.739
I've just been called up.

20:21.277 --> 20:23.447
We thought there would be peace,

20:24.881 --> 20:26.450
but this war goes on.

20:29.218 --> 20:30.821
- I don't know why.
- Shh.

20:32.288 --> 20:34.357
Do you believe
in what we're fighting for?

20:37.693 --> 20:38.729
Not really.

21:47.395 --> 21:49.063
He did what he had to.

21:49.065 --> 21:52.168
He was not content
to watch his nation go under.

21:52.535 --> 21:55.572
Before he came, it all was
in a state of collapse.

21:57.173 --> 21:58.474
A Babylon!

22:00.710 --> 22:03.078
We worshipped foreign gods.

22:03.946 --> 22:04.879
You're drunk.

22:05.146 --> 22:06.880
No!

22:06.882 --> 22:11.120
And I am not your friend.
I am your Mayor!

22:11.386 --> 22:12.989
And now they tell us

22:14.222 --> 22:16.526
to spare these other races.

22:18.228 --> 22:19.362
Degraded.

22:20.063 --> 22:24.034
So contemptible they can no
longer despise themselves!

22:28.403 --> 22:30.673
They sow the earth with salt.

22:34.911 --> 22:38.181
Instead of a world,
there is a department store.

22:38.647 --> 22:41.481
Foreigners swarm
over our streets.

22:41.483 --> 22:42.717
Immigrants who don't care

22:42.719 --> 22:45.721
for the past,
only for what they can grab.

22:46.855 --> 22:49.125
This is what happens
when a world...

22:49.491 --> 22:51.060
when a world dies.

22:51.961 --> 22:53.163
Men survive.

22:54.463 --> 22:56.198
But their life is gone.

22:56.499 --> 22:57.698
Their life is gone.

22:57.700 --> 22:59.236
Their reason for living.

23:20.221 --> 23:21.691
The mask is off.

23:23.425 --> 23:25.761
I fear for my family.

23:30.299 --> 23:31.902
Mother's old.

23:33.769 --> 23:34.671
Yeah.

23:37.440 --> 23:39.308
I hope she dies soon.

23:43.546 --> 23:45.849
Don't they know evil
when they see it?

23:59.327 --> 24:01.196
We're used to it now.

24:04.267 --> 24:05.335
Crime.

24:08.237 --> 24:09.469
No shame.

24:16.078 --> 24:17.146
Be careful.

26:00.015 --> 26:02.886
Father, if they call me up,
I can't serve.

26:03.685 --> 26:05.688
We're killing innocent people.

26:07.757 --> 26:09.289
Raiding other countries.

26:09.291 --> 26:10.492
Preying on the weak.

26:11.193 --> 26:14.061
Now the priests call
them heroes, even saints.

26:14.063 --> 26:16.032
The soldiers that do this.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.403
It might be that
the other ones are the heroes.

26:22.271 --> 26:24.838
The ones who defend their
homes against the invaders.

26:24.840 --> 26:26.175
Have you spoken
with anyone else?

26:27.343 --> 26:28.574
- Your wife?
- No.

26:28.576 --> 26:29.712
Family?

26:34.616 --> 26:35.815
Don't you think

26:35.817 --> 26:37.884
you ought to consider
the consequences

26:37.886 --> 26:39.489
of your actions?

26:40.056 --> 26:41.124
For them?

26:51.000 --> 26:53.903
You'd almost surely be shot.

26:57.207 --> 26:59.042
Yes.

27:00.777 --> 27:02.144
Your sacrifice

27:02.711 --> 27:04.314
would benefit no one.

27:14.222 --> 27:17.126
I'll speak with the Bishop,
about your case.

27:22.432 --> 27:23.831
A wiser man than I.

27:23.833 --> 27:24.934
Thank you.

27:25.835 --> 27:26.970
Thank you.

27:52.294 --> 27:54.330
These last weeks,
you're different.

28:00.301 --> 28:01.270
What is it?

28:12.848 --> 28:15.150
Morning.

28:17.119 --> 28:19.388
We are collecting
for the war effort.

28:19.655 --> 28:21.456
Hmm. I see.

28:23.792 --> 28:25.327
I'm sorry, I...

28:30.932 --> 28:33.435
Look, as I said,
I don't have anything to give.

28:33.903 --> 28:35.270
I'm...

28:39.307 --> 28:40.343
Please...

28:41.243 --> 28:42.177
No.

28:50.486 --> 28:52.121
I wish you all a good day.

29:26.020 --> 29:27.988
You have refused to
contribute

29:27.990 --> 29:30.460
to our collection
on behalf of the veterans?

29:32.327 --> 29:33.296
Their families?

29:54.250 --> 29:56.150
I also hear
that you have refused

29:56.152 --> 29:58.153
to accept the family allowance,

29:59.122 --> 30:02.258
and other subsidies the state
would have provided you.

30:03.859 --> 30:04.993
Why?

30:05.428 --> 30:07.430
Franz. Tell me.

30:20.009 --> 30:21.443
Show a little humor.

30:22.743 --> 30:24.646
Yes.

30:28.017 --> 30:30.385
Nobody refused but you.

30:40.296 --> 30:41.230
Please.

30:43.398 --> 30:44.566
Thank you.

31:41.990 --> 31:43.526
We must be strong.

31:45.894 --> 31:47.262
Stand firm.

31:53.169 --> 31:55.505
Learn the lesson
of the blacksmith.

32:00.575 --> 32:03.078
No matter how hard
the hammer strikes...

32:06.114 --> 32:07.817
the anvil cannot,

32:09.551 --> 32:11.653
need not, strike back.

32:16.057 --> 32:18.594
The anvil outlives the hammer.

32:25.166 --> 32:27.567
That which is hammered
on the anvil,

32:27.569 --> 32:28.703
takes its form,

32:29.438 --> 32:32.508
not only from the hammer,
but the anvil, too.

32:45.953 --> 32:47.123
Have a seat.

32:56.665 --> 32:58.100
Your excellency.

33:00.469 --> 33:02.605
Thank you so much
for speaking with me.

33:06.409 --> 33:08.678
If God gives us free will,

33:10.378 --> 33:12.581
we're responsible
for what we do...

33:13.949 --> 33:15.418
what we fail to do...

33:16.451 --> 33:17.452
aren't we?

33:19.689 --> 33:20.790
If our leaders

33:22.090 --> 33:23.391
are not good...

33:25.027 --> 33:26.362
if they're evil...

33:28.063 --> 33:29.332
What does one do?

33:32.000 --> 33:33.769
I want to save my life,

33:35.104 --> 33:36.572
but not through lies.

33:44.913 --> 33:47.215
You have a duty
to the Fatherland.

33:56.125 --> 33:57.926
The church tells you so.

34:07.435 --> 34:09.237
Do you know the words

34:10.371 --> 34:11.907
of the apostle?

34:18.079 --> 34:20.916
Let every man be subject

34:21.916 --> 34:24.286
"to the powers placed over him.'

34:32.494 --> 34:34.563
Do you hear those bells?

34:37.166 --> 34:38.568
They're melting them.

34:40.735 --> 34:42.237
For bullets.

34:48.110 --> 34:49.512
I think he was afraid

34:49.744 --> 34:51.213
that I might be a spy.

34:54.449 --> 34:56.483
They don't dare
to commit themselves,

34:56.485 --> 34:58.387
or it could be their turn next.

35:22.510 --> 35:25.480
We can't blame
the Bishop for going along.

35:28.217 --> 35:29.918
He hoped, by doing it,

35:30.619 --> 35:34.657
that the regime would be more
tolerant towards the Church.

35:37.125 --> 35:40.429
But now, the priests are sent

35:40.795 --> 35:42.631
to concentration camps.

35:44.900 --> 35:46.635
Church processions banned.

35:49.170 --> 35:50.639
We don't have a say.

35:53.175 --> 35:54.543
What can we do?

35:57.079 --> 35:57.980
We,

35:59.782 --> 36:01.350
little people here.

36:23.539 --> 36:26.442
Give me
a piece of coal.

36:27.175 --> 36:29.409
- Coal?
- Just one.

36:29.411 --> 36:31.079
- Just one?
- Yeah.

36:31.780 --> 36:32.848
Thank you.

36:48.130 --> 36:50.766
I paint the tombs
of the prophets.

36:55.637 --> 36:59.342
I help people look up
from those pews and dream.

37:04.313 --> 37:05.480
They look up and...

37:05.914 --> 37:08.782
they imagine that if they
lived back in Christ's time,

37:08.784 --> 37:10.686
they wouldn't have done
what the others did.

37:12.554 --> 37:15.890
They would have murdered
those whom they now adore.

37:21.096 --> 37:25.534
I paint all this suffering,
but I don't suffer myself.

37:26.434 --> 37:27.969
I make a living of it.

37:35.878 --> 37:37.146
What we do

37:38.246 --> 37:39.681
is just create

37:41.349 --> 37:42.550
sympathy.

37:43.351 --> 37:44.619
We create...

37:45.320 --> 37:47.655
We create admirers.

37:50.458 --> 37:52.124
We don't create followers.

37:57.298 --> 37:59.601
Christ's life is a demand.

38:03.338 --> 38:05.106
You don't want
to be reminded of it.

38:07.576 --> 38:10.512
So we don't have to see
what happens to the truth.

38:13.215 --> 38:14.750
A darker time is coming...

38:17.284 --> 38:19.487
when men will be more clever.

38:21.523 --> 38:23.526
They won't fight the truth.

38:25.260 --> 38:26.762
They'll just ignore it.

38:35.936 --> 38:38.574
I paint
their comfortable Christ,

38:40.309 --> 38:42.011
with a halo over his head.

38:45.347 --> 38:46.715
How can I show

38:47.282 --> 38:49.151
what I haven't lived?

38:53.355 --> 38:55.987
Someday I might have
the courage to venture.

38:55.989 --> 38:57.058
Not yet.

39:04.365 --> 39:05.634
Someday I'll...

39:06.668 --> 39:08.737
I'll paint the true Christ.

39:59.855 --> 40:01.923
They won't call you up.

40:05.492 --> 40:07.096
They need farmers.

40:10.498 --> 40:12.567
How else are people
going to eat?

40:25.480 --> 40:27.282
Maybe the war will end soon.

41:05.652 --> 41:08.590
- Is she asleep?
- Yeah.

41:24.472 --> 41:26.808
Why are you
looking at me that way?

41:31.146 --> 41:32.748
It's an act of madness.

41:34.916 --> 41:35.650
A sin...

41:35.951 --> 41:38.186
A sin against his family,
against his village.

42:29.403 --> 42:30.905
We're different, Mother.

42:36.043 --> 42:37.378
I'm sorry.

42:42.150 --> 42:45.054
But I am grateful to you
for wishing me the best.

42:54.262 --> 42:56.999
Your life was
hard enough already.

43:22.958 --> 43:25.160
His mother
looks at me coldly,

43:25.460 --> 43:27.028
like I was to blame.

43:32.434 --> 43:34.002
I want what you want.

43:34.802 --> 43:38.240
But I can't bear
that he makes you suffer.

43:42.443 --> 43:44.313
He makes a choice for you, too.

43:48.081 --> 43:49.817
Does he know what he's doing?

43:52.454 --> 43:53.422
Tell him.

43:56.423 --> 43:57.458
Pride.

43:57.759 --> 43:59.027
It's pride.

43:59.760 --> 44:01.130
That's what it is.

44:13.875 --> 44:15.409
Did they say
something to you?

44:16.777 --> 44:18.980
I saw them speaking
to you by the road.

44:33.360 --> 44:34.362
They said...

44:38.331 --> 44:40.568
...their husbands
have gone off to war.

44:42.771 --> 44:44.539
Why should they fight to...

44:46.474 --> 44:47.509
save us?

44:56.518 --> 44:57.586
Did they hurt you...

45:00.655 --> 45:02.024
with their words?

45:10.364 --> 45:11.399
I don't care.

46:44.626 --> 46:45.527
All good?

46:46.628 --> 46:47.562
Yeah.

47:11.853 --> 47:13.355
You were a wild one.

47:14.556 --> 47:16.490
You fought with the police.

47:16.958 --> 47:19.293
You know, you remember.

47:20.561 --> 47:22.096
Who changed you?

47:24.898 --> 47:26.034
Your wife?

47:28.836 --> 47:30.539
I have sympathy with you.

47:32.706 --> 47:35.242
I don't want anything bad.

47:35.876 --> 47:36.978
I know.

47:38.313 --> 47:39.247
So...

47:40.715 --> 47:41.750
Help me.

47:42.483 --> 47:43.751
Radegund loves you.

47:49.690 --> 47:50.692
You...

47:53.027 --> 47:54.628
You are a child of Radegund.

47:59.132 --> 48:01.102
I am not your enemy.

48:03.038 --> 48:04.235
I'm your friend.

48:04.237 --> 48:06.240
- Yeah?
- Yes, I am.

48:09.342 --> 48:12.312
You still belong to our people.

48:12.614 --> 48:14.449
You cannot say no

48:15.416 --> 48:16.683
to your race.

48:17.085 --> 48:18.253
And your blood.

48:19.753 --> 48:21.153
And your village.

48:21.155 --> 48:22.757
And your home.

48:23.724 --> 48:25.726
We have to defend our land!

48:26.527 --> 48:28.860
Till he came,
the people were in despair.

48:28.862 --> 48:31.032
Humiliated. In chains.

48:32.199 --> 48:34.735
Who do you think
they will make responsible?

48:35.369 --> 48:36.270
It's me.

48:37.271 --> 48:39.775
Who do you think
they will interrogate?

48:40.641 --> 48:41.976
You'll be hanged!

48:42.543 --> 48:45.010
Do you understand
what that means?

48:45.012 --> 48:46.614
They'll hang you!

48:46.947 --> 48:49.315
Your family, your wife,
your children,

48:49.317 --> 48:51.217
will have no one
to support them.

48:51.219 --> 48:53.655
Your mother will die unconsoled!

49:01.429 --> 49:02.431
Calm down.

49:04.865 --> 49:06.134
Don't touch me.

49:06.934 --> 49:07.936
Don't touch me.

49:12.007 --> 49:13.273
You're worse.

49:13.641 --> 49:15.744
You're worse than them!

49:16.143 --> 49:19.113
Because they are enemies,

49:19.646 --> 49:22.616
but you are a traitor!

49:32.726 --> 49:34.261
I've been there, to Vienna.

49:36.164 --> 49:37.666
I saw what happened there.

49:39.634 --> 49:40.367
Lost.

49:40.735 --> 49:42.267
They kicked her
in her face. Bleeding.

49:42.269 --> 49:44.472
Torn from the tent
in which we trusted.

49:44.739 --> 49:47.373
Killing the insane. Children.

49:47.375 --> 49:49.208
Brought to
the King of Terrors.

49:49.210 --> 49:50.811
We saw the hate in their eyes.

49:57.117 --> 49:59.784
We've forgotten our
true Fatherland.

50:36.456 --> 50:38.359
What would
your father say?

50:44.365 --> 50:45.534
What do you think?

50:47.101 --> 50:49.204
- He fought.
- Mm-hmm.

50:51.239 --> 50:52.840
- He died.
- Yes.

50:54.041 --> 50:56.374
And what do you think
what for he died?

50:56.376 --> 50:58.913
In the trenches, in the mud?

51:05.019 --> 51:06.288
Think about it.

51:12.793 --> 51:13.761
Yeah.

51:28.175 --> 51:29.577
I had a dream.

51:32.947 --> 51:34.079
I saw a train.

51:38.152 --> 51:40.921
The locomotive
was powerful and dark, and...

51:42.724 --> 51:44.326
it drew the children.

51:46.594 --> 51:49.396
And you couldn't see
where it was going, just...

51:50.998 --> 51:53.834
the fields and trees
flashing by.

52:17.358 --> 52:18.927
I hold to a memory.

52:24.297 --> 52:25.599
Of what I knew once.

52:38.947 --> 52:40.849
I find no one to turn to.

52:47.355 --> 52:49.057
Nothing enters my soul.

54:56.050 --> 54:58.486
When have our prayers
not been answered?

55:11.065 --> 55:13.802
If we're faithful to him,
he'll be faithful to us.

55:28.583 --> 55:29.951
I believe it.

55:37.057 --> 55:38.226
We have him.

55:43.530 --> 55:44.699
That's enough.

56:08.755 --> 56:10.757
The whole world is sinking.

56:20.300 --> 56:21.835
There's no answer.

56:26.940 --> 56:28.175
To follow him...

56:29.309 --> 56:30.844
is insanity.

56:43.389 --> 56:45.592
What are you going to do, Franz?

56:49.563 --> 56:52.530
They ask you to take an oath

56:52.532 --> 56:55.133
to the Antichrist.

56:55.135 --> 56:56.704
I know, I know.

56:57.237 --> 56:59.206
It's a life without honor.

57:03.043 --> 57:04.578
Is this here,

57:05.445 --> 57:07.047
the end of the world?

57:10.550 --> 57:12.152
Is this the death

57:13.021 --> 57:14.122
of the light?

57:30.536 --> 57:31.972
We are like a breath.

57:39.679 --> 57:41.882
Like a shadow
that passes away.

57:43.317 --> 57:44.585
Madness!

58:39.373 --> 58:40.708
I've been called up.

58:46.880 --> 58:48.416
You could hide
in the woods.

58:55.523 --> 58:56.923
We'll run away!

58:57.125 --> 58:58.192
To the mountains!

59:27.121 --> 59:28.887
Does a man have the right to let

59:28.889 --> 59:31.025
himself be put to death?

59:34.128 --> 59:35.263
For the truth?

59:38.664 --> 59:40.835
Could it possibly please God?

59:41.702 --> 59:43.805
He wants us to have peace.

59:45.806 --> 59:47.175
Happiness.

59:49.275 --> 59:52.846
Not to bring suffering
on ourselves.

01:00:03.090 --> 01:00:05.226
We have to
stand up to evil.

01:00:15.936 --> 01:00:17.872
You're going to do it,
aren't you?

01:02:20.494 --> 01:02:23.030
Her happiness
is in your hands.

01:02:25.097 --> 01:02:26.601
She could have had other men.

01:02:35.208 --> 01:02:37.577
We have enough troubles
in our lives.

01:02:53.126 --> 01:02:55.262
You want too little
for yourself, Fani.

01:03:06.739 --> 01:03:08.408
Why don't you oppose him, Fani?

01:03:09.476 --> 01:03:10.443
Hmm?

01:03:10.811 --> 01:03:11.913
Resist him.

01:03:16.315 --> 01:03:18.385
You don't know
what unhappiness is!

01:03:21.588 --> 01:03:23.124
Your man never left you.

01:03:40.306 --> 01:03:42.242
Oh, okay.

01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:15.710
You can't change the world.

01:04:29.856 --> 01:04:31.458
The world's stronger.

01:04:37.431 --> 01:04:38.532
I need you.

01:05:31.351 --> 01:05:33.119
You could work
in a hospital.

01:05:34.954 --> 01:05:36.590
There's nothing wrong with that.

01:05:45.632 --> 01:05:46.567
Is there?

01:06:18.764 --> 01:06:20.300
You want to have more?

01:07:29.335 --> 01:07:30.904
My dear son.

01:07:41.648 --> 01:07:42.750
You're all I have.

01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:52.893
You know what it is like
to grow up without a father.

01:07:59.331 --> 01:08:01.668
I know what it's like
to be alone.

01:08:23.724 --> 01:08:25.156
Girls, your...

01:08:25.158 --> 01:08:27.995
Your father is going away.

01:08:32.166 --> 01:08:33.567
On a journey.

01:08:34.734 --> 01:08:36.536
On a long journey.

01:08:37.203 --> 01:08:39.238
He'll be gone for a while.

01:13:19.586 --> 01:13:21.021
My dear wife.

01:13:27.194 --> 01:13:28.862
I know you fear for me,

01:13:30.596 --> 01:13:32.532
but my burden is light.

01:13:37.603 --> 01:13:39.402
When I compare my suffering

01:13:39.404 --> 01:13:40.907
to that of other people,

01:13:42.841 --> 01:13:45.576
I see that mine
is the smallest of crosses.

01:13:50.783 --> 01:13:53.252
It is horrible
what they have suffered.

01:14:02.362 --> 01:14:03.896
You have to remember

01:14:04.363 --> 01:14:06.065
what you knew in a better hour.

01:14:28.854 --> 01:14:30.222
Spring has come.

01:14:33.493 --> 01:14:35.492
My three little girls
will already be

01:14:35.494 --> 01:14:37.698
running barefoot,
picking flowers.

01:14:42.969 --> 01:14:44.669
It would be better to tell them

01:14:44.671 --> 01:14:47.207
where their father is
than to tell them stories.

01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:58.986
The fresh green of the grass
is good for a person.

01:15:01.988 --> 01:15:04.658
Someone with freedom
might not notice it.

01:15:22.908 --> 01:15:25.043
Greetings to Mother,
to you,

01:15:25.377 --> 01:15:26.813
the girls and all.

01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:30.951
See you again.

01:15:47.699 --> 01:15:49.001
Dear husband.

01:15:54.608 --> 01:15:55.973
Greetings in God,

01:15:55.975 --> 01:15:58.178
who will make
everything right again.

01:16:02.047 --> 01:16:04.283
Greetings from your
three little women.

01:16:09.689 --> 01:16:11.054
They say to tell you only

01:16:11.056 --> 01:16:13.059
about the good things
they're doing.

01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:14.394
Of course.

01:16:15.761 --> 01:16:16.927
But I wouldn't surprise you

01:16:16.929 --> 01:16:19.132
by telling you
about their disobedience.

01:16:23.470 --> 01:16:24.768
Ow!

01:16:32.045 --> 01:16:33.980
I have to scold the girls.

01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:40.020
They're always
demanding my attention.

01:16:52.097 --> 01:16:54.935
Rosi's always asking about you.

01:16:56.002 --> 01:16:57.771
When we are going to bed,

01:16:58.503 --> 01:16:59.506
she says,

01:17:00.073 --> 01:17:02.008
"Leave the door unlocked

01:17:02.742 --> 01:17:04.411
so Papa can come in."

01:17:09.282 --> 01:17:10.350
At meals,

01:17:11.516 --> 01:17:13.385
"Save some for Papa."

01:17:21.828 --> 01:17:23.530
She sang a song for you.

01:17:29.935 --> 01:17:31.438
Wondered if you could hear.

01:17:36.208 --> 01:17:39.412
Rosi wanted to take your picture
to bed with her tonight.

01:17:43.248 --> 01:17:45.519
You were supposed
to sleep beside her.

01:17:49.588 --> 01:17:52.525
I told her that when Father
comes home, he will.

01:17:56.863 --> 01:17:58.331
Good night.

01:18:13.779 --> 01:18:16.049
Warm greetings
from your loving wife,

01:18:20.819 --> 01:18:22.021
Fani.

01:18:39.005 --> 01:18:40.472
You may leave us alone.

01:18:42.507 --> 01:18:43.510
Have a seat.

01:18:57.355 --> 01:18:59.893
What good do you think
your defiance is doing anyone?

01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:06.599
You think it will change
the course of things?

01:19:14.073 --> 01:19:16.209
You think the authorities
are aware of you?

01:19:17.042 --> 01:19:19.311
That your protests
will come to their attention?

01:19:24.917 --> 01:19:27.621
Do you think anyone
will know of it? Ever hear?

01:19:30.256 --> 01:19:33.493
No one knows what goes on
behind these walls. No one.

01:19:36.828 --> 01:19:38.430
What purpose does it serve?

01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:49.307
Does it make no difference

01:19:49.309 --> 01:19:51.610
if this war is just or unjust?

01:20:00.086 --> 01:20:01.954
You shine their shoes.

01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:12.197
You fill their sandbags.

01:20:17.436 --> 01:20:18.634
Are you innocent?

01:20:55.774 --> 01:20:56.710
What is it?

01:20:57.643 --> 01:20:58.645
Pride?

01:21:02.015 --> 01:21:03.583
Are you better than the rest?

01:21:05.818 --> 01:21:07.253
Are you alone wise?

01:21:12.759 --> 01:21:14.461
How do you know
what is good or bad?

01:21:24.270 --> 01:21:25.605
You know better than I?

01:21:31.644 --> 01:21:33.213
Did heaven tell you this?

01:21:35.081 --> 01:21:36.483
Heard a voice?

01:21:44.789 --> 01:21:45.925
There's a difference,

01:21:46.125 --> 01:21:48.527
between the kind of suffering
we can't avoid

01:21:48.926 --> 01:21:50.529
and the suffering we choose.

01:22:13.586 --> 01:22:15.722
You've forgotten
what the world looks like.

01:22:19.759 --> 01:22:20.760
The light.

01:22:22.127 --> 01:22:23.429
The sky.

01:22:37.109 --> 01:22:39.345
I didn't make this world
the way it is.

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:42.748
And neither did you.

01:22:48.487 --> 01:22:50.690
We all have blood on our hands.

01:22:52.759 --> 01:22:54.194
No one is innocent.

01:22:55.127 --> 01:22:57.097
Crime, bloodshed everywhere.

01:23:03.703 --> 01:23:05.505
He who created this world...

01:23:07.073 --> 01:23:08.541
he created evil.

01:23:16.682 --> 01:23:20.252
Conscience makes cowards
of us all.

01:23:28.694 --> 01:23:30.296
Take care, my friend.

01:23:33.032 --> 01:23:34.833
The Antichrist is clever.

01:23:38.104 --> 01:23:40.373
He uses a man's virtues...

01:23:42.307 --> 01:23:43.807
to mislead him.

01:24:40.932 --> 01:24:42.068
Dearest wife...

01:24:45.971 --> 01:24:49.039
I leave for Berlin
at 10:13 A.M.

01:24:53.145 --> 01:24:54.713
Have no concerns about me.

01:24:57.182 --> 01:24:58.551
Pray for me.

01:27:18.189 --> 01:27:19.424
Look down.

01:27:24.829 --> 01:27:25.765
Down.

01:27:32.837 --> 01:27:33.739
Up.

01:28:30.462 --> 01:28:31.831
Dear husband...

01:28:36.801 --> 01:28:39.471
Your letter of May 7th
has arrived.

01:28:40.405 --> 01:28:41.673
Many thanks.

01:29:00.125 --> 01:29:02.127
The well went dry on Thursday.

01:29:07.065 --> 01:29:08.634
We need a good rain.

01:29:39.465 --> 01:29:41.766
What I feared has come.

01:29:44.871 --> 01:29:47.573
I have found no one
to assist with the work,

01:29:48.106 --> 01:29:49.274
except for Resie.

01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:11.863
Strohofer stole beets
from our field.

01:30:20.171 --> 01:30:22.942
I hear nothing
but your voice.

01:30:37.689 --> 01:30:39.158
I visited the widow.

01:30:40.458 --> 01:30:41.594
Maria.

01:30:45.264 --> 01:30:48.231
She hadn't spoken with anyone
in two weeks.

01:30:57.876 --> 01:31:00.279
The new hay gives me hope.

01:31:03.381 --> 01:31:04.781
The scent in the barn.

01:31:08.587 --> 01:31:09.855
The wind.

01:31:13.692 --> 01:31:15.094
The wheat.

01:31:18.396 --> 01:31:19.664
The sky.

01:31:41.654 --> 01:31:44.123
He won't send us more
than we can bear.

01:32:59.064 --> 01:33:00.865
Excuse me, can you tell me...

01:33:43.175 --> 01:33:45.575
The Colonel
must be consulted.

01:33:45.577 --> 01:33:47.880
May I meet with him?

01:33:51.984 --> 01:33:53.352
A busy man.

01:33:54.953 --> 01:33:57.323
But phone, make an appointment.

01:33:59.792 --> 01:34:00.956
I've tried to,

01:34:00.958 --> 01:34:02.960
but my call isn't answered.

01:34:02.962 --> 01:34:04.497
That surprises me.

01:34:08.132 --> 01:34:10.402
The problem must be
on your side.

01:34:11.168 --> 01:34:13.538
The telephone works
quite well up here.

01:34:22.614 --> 01:34:23.648
Then...

01:34:23.981 --> 01:34:25.818
how can I make an appointment?

01:34:27.719 --> 01:34:29.454
You don't answer my letters.

01:34:32.590 --> 01:34:33.956
It took me two days to get here.

01:34:33.958 --> 01:34:35.860
It's a very difficult journey.

01:35:48.466 --> 01:35:49.634
Most beloved wife...

01:35:52.136 --> 01:35:55.206
Once again, warm greetings
from your loving husband.

01:36:10.956 --> 01:36:12.591
I'll write a few words,

01:36:12.925 --> 01:36:14.960
just as they come from my heart.

01:36:18.396 --> 01:36:21.099
Even though I am writing them
with bound hands,

01:36:21.632 --> 01:36:24.469
it's still better than
if my will were bound.

01:36:44.555 --> 01:36:45.556
These men...

01:36:46.858 --> 01:36:48.360
have no friends.

01:36:52.630 --> 01:36:55.167
No loving hand to hold theirs.

01:36:57.234 --> 01:36:58.670
What are you here for?

01:36:59.938 --> 01:37:01.140
Treason.

01:37:02.306 --> 01:37:04.108
They've seen sorrow.

01:37:05.877 --> 01:37:07.046
Shame.

01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:10.349
Destruction.

01:37:18.222 --> 01:37:20.125
What strong hearts.

01:37:54.059 --> 01:37:55.391
When you give up the idea

01:37:55.393 --> 01:37:57.596
of surviving at any price...

01:38:01.832 --> 01:38:04.135
a new light floods in.

01:38:09.073 --> 01:38:11.042
Once you were in a rush...

01:38:12.143 --> 01:38:14.212
always short of time.

01:38:19.051 --> 01:38:20.753
Now you have all you need.

01:38:29.226 --> 01:38:31.596
Once you never
forgave anyone...

01:38:33.998 --> 01:38:35.964
judged people without mercy.

01:38:40.371 --> 01:38:43.074
Now you see
your own weakness...

01:38:44.609 --> 01:38:47.445
so you can understand
the weakness of others.

01:42:35.006 --> 01:42:36.007
Do you think...

01:42:39.810 --> 01:42:41.012
I did this?

01:42:46.016 --> 01:42:47.685
He used to be different.

01:42:51.456 --> 01:42:53.625
He changed when he met you.

01:43:24.087 --> 01:43:25.487
My dear children...

01:43:28.859 --> 01:43:33.262
I thought of you especially,
Corpus Christi Sunday.

01:43:44.074 --> 01:43:45.277
The bells ringing

01:43:45.543 --> 01:43:47.010
over the fields.

01:43:49.881 --> 01:43:51.714
I would have loved
to have seen you

01:43:51.716 --> 01:43:53.585
with your crowns of flowers.

01:43:59.256 --> 01:44:01.126
Your devoted father greets you,

01:44:03.028 --> 01:44:04.463
from far away.

01:44:54.110 --> 01:44:55.544
Dear husband...

01:44:58.216 --> 01:45:00.819
Loving greetings to you
on this Sunday.

01:45:04.454 --> 01:45:06.289
We're all concerned about you.

01:45:10.028 --> 01:45:11.059
Hopefully,

01:45:11.061 --> 01:45:12.963
things are not going poorly.

01:45:16.768 --> 01:45:18.636
The girls send greetings.

01:45:23.073 --> 01:45:26.076
Loisi says they will give you
kisses together.

01:45:32.449 --> 01:45:34.586
I'm always with you in thought.

01:45:59.810 --> 01:46:01.613
I can go to Salzburg.

01:46:12.456 --> 01:46:14.358
Papa offered to come with me.

01:46:25.436 --> 01:46:27.605
Fear overcomes me.

01:46:30.307 --> 01:46:31.975
I know it should not.

01:46:36.747 --> 01:46:39.584
Trust in the triumph
of the good.

01:46:45.555 --> 01:46:48.092
No evil can happen
to a good man.

01:46:54.899 --> 01:46:57.002
Not a sparrow falls to Earth,

01:46:58.234 --> 01:46:59.468
but he knows it.

01:47:29.300 --> 01:47:30.668
I'm sorry.

01:47:39.143 --> 01:47:40.612
A father...

01:47:41.112 --> 01:47:42.646
loves his child.

01:47:46.283 --> 01:47:47.351
A father

01:47:48.351 --> 01:47:50.220
wants his child to be happy.

01:47:51.488 --> 01:47:53.357
For life not to touch her.

01:47:58.363 --> 01:47:59.631
And you...

01:48:05.202 --> 01:48:06.771
such a good child.

01:48:10.307 --> 01:48:11.676
Franz, too.

01:48:17.881 --> 01:48:20.884
Better to suffer injustice
than to do it.

01:49:22.747 --> 01:49:24.646
I've been appointed
by the court

01:49:24.648 --> 01:49:26.284
to be your defense attorney.

01:49:28.720 --> 01:49:30.486
As I understand,
your resistance is

01:49:30.488 --> 01:49:32.891
specifically to serving
in combat.

01:49:34.057 --> 01:49:36.795
But I believe if you were
to accept medical service,

01:49:37.429 --> 01:49:39.029
you would work

01:49:40.064 --> 01:49:42.833
as an orderly in a hospital,
that sort of thing.

01:49:43.768 --> 01:49:46.371
They would probably
drop these charges.

01:49:53.444 --> 01:49:56.214
Will I be required
to swear loyalty to Hitler?

01:49:56.447 --> 01:49:57.148
Oh, words!

01:49:57.648 --> 01:49:59.884
I mean, no one takes that
sort of thing seriously. Hmm?

01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:03.387
I can't.

01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:11.963
You are a stubborn man.

01:50:15.233 --> 01:50:19.302
See here, I am going to
leave this paper with you.

01:50:19.304 --> 01:50:20.739
Keep it with you.

01:50:21.104 --> 01:50:22.005
Sign,

01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:24.242
and you will go free.

01:50:26.243 --> 01:50:27.411
But I am free.

01:50:32.216 --> 01:50:34.318
So... why am I here?

01:50:39.256 --> 01:50:40.423
I don't know.

01:50:49.266 --> 01:50:50.268
You...

01:50:51.569 --> 01:50:52.871
my shepherd.

01:51:03.413 --> 01:51:06.416
You make me lie down
in green pastures.

01:51:13.423 --> 01:51:15.225
By the river of life.

01:51:28.805 --> 01:51:30.007
You...

01:51:32.743 --> 01:51:34.112
my strength.

01:51:38.682 --> 01:51:40.385
You show me the path.

01:51:47.457 --> 01:51:48.525
You...

01:51:51.828 --> 01:51:53.264
our light.

01:51:58.502 --> 01:52:01.139
Darkness is not dark to you.

01:52:07.711 --> 01:52:09.914
Bring us to your eternal light.

01:52:14.685 --> 01:52:15.887
To you.

01:52:19.355 --> 01:52:20.425
The true.

01:52:25.029 --> 01:52:27.031
The never-failing light.

01:52:41.546 --> 01:52:43.146
You call me your brother.

01:52:56.560 --> 01:52:57.562
Father.

01:53:02.367 --> 01:53:04.068
To you I cry.

01:53:10.307 --> 01:53:11.376
My rock.

01:53:15.445 --> 01:53:16.613
My fortress.

01:53:19.750 --> 01:53:21.652
I can do as I like with you.

01:53:22.185 --> 01:53:24.919
Nobody would know.
Nobody would care.

01:53:24.921 --> 01:53:27.291
Nobody'd lift a hand
to stop me.

01:53:35.867 --> 01:53:36.932
Who sees us?

01:53:47.778 --> 01:53:49.380
Give me strength.

01:53:54.819 --> 01:53:56.120
To follow you.

01:54:02.993 --> 01:54:04.228
Spirit...

01:54:12.936 --> 01:54:14.204
Lead me.

01:54:17.942 --> 01:54:19.210
Show me.

01:55:01.418 --> 01:55:02.420
Lord...

01:55:15.164 --> 01:55:16.768
You do nothing.

01:55:58.309 --> 01:55:59.710
Where are you?

01:56:12.189 --> 01:56:14.555
Why did you create us?

01:57:09.179 --> 01:57:10.411
Have the persecuted

01:57:10.413 --> 01:57:12.716
received the kingdom
of heaven?

01:57:22.326 --> 01:57:24.529
The meek inherited
the earth?

01:57:31.002 --> 01:57:33.304
The wise deceive us.

01:57:33.936 --> 01:57:35.405
Afraid.

01:57:35.872 --> 01:57:37.240
Oh...

01:57:38.408 --> 01:57:40.510
I was once like you.

01:57:46.250 --> 01:57:47.518
Confess it.

01:57:50.354 --> 01:57:52.423
Your God has no pity.

01:57:53.757 --> 01:57:56.592
He left us. Abandoned us.

01:57:56.893 --> 01:57:58.496
Like he did your Christ.

01:57:58.862 --> 01:57:59.931
His son!

01:58:09.605 --> 01:58:12.609
How far we are
from having our daily bread.

01:58:15.244 --> 01:58:17.245
How far from being delivered

01:58:17.247 --> 01:58:18.516
from evil!

01:58:29.859 --> 01:58:34.396
If we could only see
the beginning of his kingdom.

01:58:37.367 --> 01:58:38.735
The dawn!

01:58:41.171 --> 01:58:43.007
But...

01:58:45.943 --> 01:58:47.011
Nothing.

01:58:50.213 --> 01:58:51.582
Nothing ever!

01:58:55.519 --> 01:58:57.986
Why give your life for them?

01:59:08.966 --> 01:59:10.868
Your man died in vain.

01:59:14.037 --> 01:59:15.037
He came.

01:59:15.505 --> 01:59:17.507
And it was all for nothing.

01:59:51.609 --> 01:59:54.512
We had 20 centuries
of failure.

01:59:55.679 --> 01:59:58.048
We need a successful saint.

02:01:01.112 --> 02:01:02.046
Oh, yeah.

02:01:04.047 --> 02:01:05.515
No one will help us,

02:01:06.516 --> 02:01:08.418
well, we do it on our own.

02:01:10.220 --> 02:01:11.422
Sister?

02:01:15.359 --> 02:01:16.727
Yes.

02:01:46.622 --> 02:01:48.525
Come on.

02:02:00.235 --> 02:02:01.137
Okay.

02:02:01.872 --> 02:02:02.840
Yeah.

02:03:23.086 --> 02:03:24.188
Dear wife,

02:03:28.057 --> 02:03:31.662
I still can't say
how my future will unfold.

02:03:35.666 --> 02:03:38.202
What comes next is
seldom better.

02:03:40.603 --> 02:03:43.606
And still,
now begins the month of June.

02:03:45.576 --> 02:03:47.211
The most beautiful month.

02:03:51.381 --> 02:03:53.415
Nature does not notice
the sorrow

02:03:53.417 --> 02:03:55.119
that has come over the people.

02:03:57.921 --> 02:03:59.687
Though I cannot see much here,

02:03:59.689 --> 02:04:01.358
I imagine that everything

02:04:01.557 --> 02:04:04.862
is a more lovely green
than in past years.

02:04:17.875 --> 02:04:18.774
At dawn,

02:04:19.275 --> 02:04:23.113
we can hear blackbirds singing
loudly outside our windows.

02:04:27.917 --> 02:04:29.720
They seem to have more freedom

02:04:30.319 --> 02:04:32.988
and to know more of
peace and happiness,

02:04:33.622 --> 02:04:36.259
though they are
only unreasoning animals

02:04:37.161 --> 02:04:38.761
than we humans do.

02:04:39.962 --> 02:04:43.067
We, who have the gift
of understanding.

02:05:02.452 --> 02:05:04.686
You gave me back more
than I gave you.

02:05:26.809 --> 02:05:28.345
I found a fellow here

02:05:30.447 --> 02:05:31.981
from my training days.

02:05:33.216 --> 02:05:34.118
Franz?

02:05:36.086 --> 02:05:37.054
Franz!

02:05:37.753 --> 02:05:38.956
Look at you.

02:05:41.658 --> 02:05:43.593
What have you done?
You're a criminal!

02:05:43.893 --> 02:05:46.529
He lifts the spirits
of the other fellows.

02:05:46.962 --> 02:05:48.398
We're getting on just fine.

02:05:49.832 --> 02:05:52.134
Good, bad, together.

02:05:52.769 --> 02:05:54.905
He asks about our family.

02:05:55.405 --> 02:05:56.673
Don't you worry.

02:05:57.341 --> 02:05:58.540
Trouble lasts a day.

02:05:58.542 --> 02:05:59.973
Yeah, eat. Eat. Eat.

02:05:59.975 --> 02:06:01.911
- Is that all you have?
- Yeah.

02:06:09.953 --> 02:06:12.089
Have you heard
of the Scharfrichter?

02:06:14.724 --> 02:06:16.427
The one who chops off your head?

02:06:22.398 --> 02:06:24.067
He's a very well-dressed man.

02:06:24.266 --> 02:06:25.868
He comes and he has a...

02:06:27.104 --> 02:06:28.137
a big hat.

02:06:28.771 --> 02:06:30.440
He is a man of good taste.

02:06:31.807 --> 02:06:34.344
He cuts your head,
but it's a clean cut,

02:06:34.543 --> 02:06:36.412
and before
you can think a thought,

02:06:36.680 --> 02:06:38.148
just...

02:07:07.444 --> 02:07:08.912
I wonder how it feels.

02:07:10.313 --> 02:07:14.014
Maybe your body's old,
your head is young,

02:07:14.016 --> 02:07:16.052
and you see
your head flying away.

02:07:16.587 --> 02:07:17.954
And your old arms...

02:07:18.287 --> 02:07:19.521
they reach up

02:07:19.823 --> 02:07:21.125
to the head.

02:07:22.391 --> 02:07:24.193
And they're still in chains.

02:07:26.429 --> 02:07:29.032
And you take this young head...

02:07:31.768 --> 02:07:35.038
and you put it back
on your body.

02:07:36.773 --> 02:07:38.475
And you open your eyes...

02:07:40.542 --> 02:07:42.345
and the chains are gone!

02:07:46.382 --> 02:07:47.451
But what happens then?

02:07:53.457 --> 02:07:55.057
Maybe you'll see the moon.

02:07:58.427 --> 02:07:59.563
Or the stars.

02:08:14.476 --> 02:08:16.313
You know, even if it rains,

02:08:16.947 --> 02:08:18.414
the sun is shining.

02:08:22.351 --> 02:08:23.252
The sun

02:08:23.587 --> 02:08:25.088
shines on good

02:08:25.521 --> 02:08:26.523
and evil

02:08:26.789 --> 02:08:27.925
the same.

02:08:46.109 --> 02:08:47.642
There are more chains

02:08:47.644 --> 02:08:49.046
than mad dogs.

02:09:44.234 --> 02:09:46.169
I wish I'd had a wife.

02:09:47.869 --> 02:09:49.238
And a farm.

02:09:52.108 --> 02:09:53.677
And apple trees.

02:09:54.677 --> 02:09:56.078
And a cherry tree.

02:09:56.912 --> 02:09:58.114
And...

02:09:59.114 --> 02:10:00.716
maybe some grapes.

02:10:01.251 --> 02:10:03.052
We could do our own wine.

02:10:05.255 --> 02:10:06.056
White wine.

02:10:06.256 --> 02:10:10.093
And red wine.
One red wine for the winter.

02:10:10.792 --> 02:10:13.663
And white wine for the summer.

02:10:14.930 --> 02:10:16.565
We would not drink too much.

02:10:17.466 --> 02:10:19.567
We would pray. And work.

02:10:19.569 --> 02:10:20.367
But sometimes...

02:10:20.369 --> 02:10:22.338
Sometimes, a little drink
is good.

02:10:24.606 --> 02:10:25.609
Sometimes...

02:10:27.109 --> 02:10:28.679
we would go to church.

02:10:29.979 --> 02:10:32.215
And sometimes not. Sometimes...

02:10:32.948 --> 02:10:34.417
we'd stay at home.

02:10:37.086 --> 02:10:38.622
And we'd make music.

02:13:05.301 --> 02:13:07.268
Do you have anything to say

02:13:07.270 --> 02:13:08.805
in your defense?

02:13:39.202 --> 02:13:41.304
We'll have
a short recess.

02:13:57.987 --> 02:13:59.355
Come in.

02:14:07.296 --> 02:14:08.664
Please, uh...

02:14:21.243 --> 02:14:22.612
Sit down.

02:14:23.112 --> 02:14:24.346
Thank you.

02:14:28.850 --> 02:14:31.418
Do you imagine
that anything you do

02:14:31.420 --> 02:14:34.457
will change
the course of this war?

02:14:36.024 --> 02:14:40.496
That anyone outside this court
will ever hear of you?

02:14:43.432 --> 02:14:45.502
No one will be changed.

02:14:47.536 --> 02:14:49.838
The world will go on as before.

02:15:01.484 --> 02:15:04.250
Your actions may even
have the opposite effect

02:15:04.252 --> 02:15:05.721
of what you intend.

02:15:08.390 --> 02:15:11.493
Someone else
will take your place.

02:15:23.139 --> 02:15:25.442
Do you judge me?

02:15:30.712 --> 02:15:31.747
I don't judge you.

02:15:35.752 --> 02:15:36.951
I'm not saying,

02:15:36.953 --> 02:15:38.121
"He's wicked.

02:15:38.354 --> 02:15:39.555
I am right."

02:15:42.225 --> 02:15:43.627
I don't know everything.

02:15:52.234 --> 02:15:53.335
A man...

02:15:54.804 --> 02:15:55.904
may do wrong.

02:15:59.274 --> 02:16:00.376
And...

02:16:01.978 --> 02:16:03.512
he can't get out of it.

02:16:04.881 --> 02:16:06.516
To make his life clear.

02:16:10.752 --> 02:16:14.056
Maybe... he'd like to go back
but he can't.

02:16:16.993 --> 02:16:17.994
But...

02:16:22.131 --> 02:16:24.667
I have this feeling
inside me...

02:16:28.871 --> 02:16:30.340
...that I can't do

02:16:31.140 --> 02:16:32.641
what I believe is wrong.

02:16:46.487 --> 02:16:48.725
Do you have
a right to do this?

02:16:51.261 --> 02:16:53.029
Do I have a right not to?

02:17:47.850 --> 02:17:50.853
The judgment
of this court is...

02:17:52.254 --> 02:17:53.456
death.

02:18:20.915 --> 02:18:23.718
So today
they pronounced the sentence.

02:18:27.957 --> 02:18:29.191
But they still

02:18:29.992 --> 02:18:31.628
have to confirm it.

02:18:35.331 --> 02:18:36.964
Sign the paper in your cell.

02:18:36.966 --> 02:18:39.067
You'll go free.
I can work it out.

02:20:51.734 --> 02:20:53.569
It's from his lawyer!

02:21:09.550 --> 02:21:11.587
They've
condemned him to death.

02:21:15.858 --> 02:21:17.693
I have to go to Berlin.

02:21:20.797 --> 02:21:22.031
I'll come with you.

02:23:56.317 --> 02:23:57.486
Franz!

02:24:54.909 --> 02:24:57.112
You're doing no one any good.

02:25:00.415 --> 02:25:01.483
No one.

02:25:05.420 --> 02:25:08.356
This could be the last
opportunity to abandon this...

02:25:11.527 --> 02:25:13.262
senseless position.

02:25:14.663 --> 02:25:15.965
If you do...

02:25:16.264 --> 02:25:17.031
Franz.

02:25:17.299 --> 02:25:19.132
...I will at once
petition the court

02:25:19.134 --> 02:25:21.134
to stay the execution
of your sentence,

02:25:21.136 --> 02:25:22.939
but it must be done
without delay.

02:25:23.672 --> 02:25:25.041
Do you understand?

02:25:26.709 --> 02:25:27.844
Now.

02:25:31.345 --> 02:25:34.279
I'm sticking
my neck out here.

02:25:34.281 --> 02:25:35.584
This could jeopardize
my career...

02:25:37.019 --> 02:25:38.387
my personal safety.

02:25:41.323 --> 02:25:44.393
The charges would be dropped,
I'm sure, if you just...

02:25:45.394 --> 02:25:46.996
change your stand.

02:25:47.563 --> 02:25:48.597
I beg you to.

02:25:50.532 --> 02:25:52.501
The war may soon be over.

02:25:53.668 --> 02:25:54.904
You might...

02:25:56.237 --> 02:25:58.572
You might never
have to face a situation

02:25:58.574 --> 02:26:01.244
that would call on you
to do what you oppose.

02:26:02.778 --> 02:26:04.146
My love.

02:26:07.082 --> 02:26:08.251
Franz.

02:26:10.818 --> 02:26:12.354
Don't you see what's coming?

02:26:19.060 --> 02:26:20.529
There's not much time!

02:26:22.531 --> 02:26:25.568
God doesn't care what you say,
only what's in your heart.

02:26:28.370 --> 02:26:30.573
Say the oath
and think what you like.

02:26:47.923 --> 02:26:49.292
Do you understand?

02:27:14.750 --> 02:27:16.118
I love you.

02:27:21.756 --> 02:27:23.158
Whatever you do.

02:27:26.528 --> 02:27:27.595
Whatever...

02:27:28.496 --> 02:27:29.397
comes.

02:27:35.704 --> 02:27:37.105
I'm with you.

02:27:41.743 --> 02:27:42.745
Always.

02:27:59.861 --> 02:28:01.397
Do what is right.

02:28:23.385 --> 02:28:26.522
No! Let me go!

02:29:40.862 --> 02:29:42.197
You said,

02:29:42.564 --> 02:29:43.498
"Knock.

02:29:45.100 --> 02:29:46.801
It will be opened.

02:29:49.570 --> 02:29:50.638
Ask.

02:29:53.041 --> 02:29:54.508
It will be given."

02:32:59.193 --> 02:33:00.862
You've always been good to me.

02:33:02.698 --> 02:33:03.832
And to my son.

02:33:04.665 --> 02:33:05.634
And I've...

02:33:15.175 --> 02:33:16.545
Forgive me!

02:34:21.141 --> 02:34:22.144
You.

02:34:25.579 --> 02:34:27.750
You love him more than I do.

02:34:37.425 --> 02:34:38.960
Give him courage.

02:34:41.462 --> 02:34:42.663
Wisdom.

02:34:46.400 --> 02:34:47.602
Strength.

02:35:09.356 --> 02:35:10.626
Father...

02:35:24.105 --> 02:35:25.907
Tomorrow it will be done.

02:35:44.325 --> 02:35:45.693
Thank you, Father.

02:36:34.742 --> 02:36:36.810
Now, my dear children...

02:36:37.545 --> 02:36:39.915
When mother
reads this letter to you,

02:36:41.415 --> 02:36:43.117
your father will be dead.

02:36:46.987 --> 02:36:49.891
Through God's grace
we'll soon meet again.

02:37:03.104 --> 02:37:05.073
Dearest wife and mother...

02:37:06.641 --> 02:37:10.242
It was not possible for me
to free you from the sorrows

02:37:10.244 --> 02:37:11.712
that you've endured for me.

02:37:18.253 --> 02:37:19.221
And now,

02:37:20.022 --> 02:37:21.422
oh, my dear ones,

02:37:22.022 --> 02:37:25.124
don't forget me
in your prayers.

02:37:26.527 --> 02:37:28.129
I pray for you.

02:37:29.064 --> 02:37:30.231
From the other side.

02:38:58.486 --> 02:38:59.754
What do I write?

02:39:48.302 --> 02:39:49.837
Shh.

02:41:10.317 --> 02:41:11.252
Franz.

02:41:25.233 --> 02:41:26.234
Franz.

02:46:02.877 --> 02:46:04.342
A time will come
when we will know

02:46:04.344 --> 02:46:06.081
what all this is for.

02:46:19.260 --> 02:46:21.496
And there will be no mysteries.
We will know...

02:46:23.863 --> 02:46:24.865
why...

02:46:28.503 --> 02:46:29.570
we live.

02:46:40.681 --> 02:46:42.250
We'll come together.

02:46:47.888 --> 02:46:49.557
We'll plant orchards.

02:46:52.926 --> 02:46:54.194
Fields.

02:46:58.932 --> 02:47:01.469
We'll build the land back up.

02:47:29.996 --> 02:47:31.265
Franz.

02:47:41.675 --> 02:47:43.210
I'll meet you there.

02:47:49.950 --> 02:47:51.518
In the mountains.
