00:17.600 --> 00:19.143
ANNOUNCER: Jedi abducted!

00:19.269 --> 00:21.478
Ahsoka Tano is missing in action.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.647
Captured and released into a hostile jungle,

00:23.773 --> 00:27.776
she fights to stay alive with the help
of a small band of Jedi younglings.

00:28.111 --> 00:32.948
As Anakin Skywalker scours the galaxy,
desperate to find his lost apprentice,

00:33.074 --> 00:36.493
Trandoshan sport hunters
track their youngling prey.

00:36.619 --> 00:40.622
With the death of their leader Kalifa,
and separated from her friends,

00:40.665 --> 00:45.002
we find Ahsoka on the run,
as the hunters close in around her.

00:45.128 --> 00:46.420

01:16.743 --> 01:18.035
(PANTING)

01:42.143 --> 01:43.644
Where is she?

01:44.437 --> 01:48.732
This one was faster than most,
I've lost the scent!

01:48.817 --> 01:50.109
(GROWLS)

01:50.193 --> 01:52.569
She can't hide forever.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.655
Mark my words,

01:54.739 --> 01:56.782
I'll have her hide

01:56.866 --> 02:01.078
and nail it to the wall for killing my son.

02:14.759 --> 02:16.009
(GROWLS)

02:40.660 --> 02:42.161
You made it!

02:42.245 --> 02:44.079
We feared the worst.

02:46.291 --> 02:48.083
JINX: Where's Kalifa?

02:48.168 --> 02:49.501
She didn't make it.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.421
She's dead?

02:54.007 --> 02:55.841
I can't believe it.

02:55.925 --> 02:58.760
She had been here longer than any of us,
and now...

02:58.845 --> 03:02.347
We're all going to die here,
it's only a matter of time.

03:03.308 --> 03:07.978
If it's only a matter of time till we die,
I say we go down with a fight.

03:08.062 --> 03:09.271
(SCOFFS)

03:09.439 --> 03:11.106
That is suicide.

03:11.691 --> 03:15.861
You've said that every few days
they release new prisoners on the beach.

03:16.279 --> 03:20.741
I say we attack that dropship head on.
They'll never expect it.

03:22.660 --> 03:23.869
(SIGHS)

03:23.953 --> 03:25.454
Is it worth a shot?

03:26.664 --> 03:28.540
Maybe it is.

03:40.970 --> 03:43.222
Get ready, we'll have to be swift.

03:43.306 --> 03:45.641
The drop point's not far.

03:55.860 --> 03:56.985
Now!

04:03.910 --> 04:07.246
What the...
It's one of those blasted Jedi whelps!

04:08.164 --> 04:09.164
Get her!

04:12.335 --> 04:13.585

04:21.511 --> 04:22.886

05:45.553 --> 05:47.262
But the prisoners! They'll die!

05:47.388 --> 05:48.513
Hit the release, hurry!

06:09.702 --> 06:12.954
Well, I guess we won't be escaping
on that ship.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.040
We'll find another way.

06:16.834 --> 06:17.959
(LOUD ROAR)

06:21.422 --> 06:24.049
-What was that?
-A survivor.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.389
It could be one of the prisoners
they were dropping off.

06:41.442 --> 06:42.984
What is that?

06:46.989 --> 06:48.615
It's a Wookiee!

06:49.784 --> 06:50.992
(ROARS)

06:56.541 --> 06:57.833
Ahh!

06:57.875 --> 07:02.671
It's the younglings that did this.
They're getting bold.

07:02.713 --> 07:04.840
What about survivors?

07:05.341 --> 07:07.342
Both of our men were killed,

07:07.385 --> 07:11.012
and there was only one prisoner,
a Wookiee.

07:11.556 --> 07:14.349
And he's missing.

07:15.184 --> 07:20.689
So now the younglings are organized, bold,

07:20.731 --> 07:23.733
and they've got a Wookiee.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.615
Your name is Chewbacca?

07:30.867 --> 07:32.284
(ROARS)

07:32.577 --> 07:36.037
Chewbacca, does anyone even know
you were taken?

07:36.456 --> 07:39.207
(ROARS)

07:39.584 --> 07:43.044
No, but he says his home world
is very close.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.254
That's great,

07:44.380 --> 07:46.715
but it might as well be Coruscant,
as far as I'm concerned.

07:46.799 --> 07:48.550
We've got no ship.

07:49.218 --> 07:50.594
(GRUNTS)

07:54.390 --> 07:58.727
He thinks he can contact his home planet
if we find a way to transmit a signal.

07:58.811 --> 08:01.438
Right, and how would we do that?

08:01.522 --> 08:02.898
Send smoke signals?

08:02.982 --> 08:06.276
We don't exactly have a transmitter
lying around, if you haven't noticed.

08:06.360 --> 08:08.028
(GRUNTING)

08:10.781 --> 08:14.951
Chewbacca says he can build a transmitter
from the wreckage on the beach.

08:17.872 --> 08:19.664
Well, we can't just sit here.

08:20.374 --> 08:23.335
Fine, we'll do it the Wookiee way.

08:29.008 --> 08:31.510
Chewbacca and I will go out
to inspect the crash site.

08:31.594 --> 08:34.429
You two stay here,
and signal us if you see anything.

08:55.243 --> 08:57.035
Get back! It's a patrol.

09:06.295 --> 09:07.837
Happy hunting.

09:20.476 --> 09:23.270
Hopefully that patrol
won't be back for a while.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.022
What are we looking for?

09:28.359 --> 09:29.651

09:29.860 --> 09:33.280
Are you still feeling optimistic about
making a transmitter out of this junk?

SMUG: Now, what do we have here?

10:00.558 --> 10:03.810
(SIGHS) We better get going.
That patrol might come back.

10:12.361 --> 10:15.864
Come on, pretties. One more step.

10:17.366 --> 10:19.534

11:42.618 --> 11:43.785
How's it looking, Chewbacca?

11:44.537 --> 11:45.912
(ROARS)

11:46.872 --> 11:48.373
Will it work?

(ROARING)

11:56.799 --> 11:58.216
We've got a prisoner.

11:58.300 --> 12:01.553
We should be using him to our advantage
while we have a chance.

12:01.804 --> 12:04.472
I thought the prisoner
was the backup plan?

12:04.557 --> 12:07.267
It's clear enough
that we cannot rely on that device.

12:07.309 --> 12:08.435
(ROARS)

12:08.477 --> 12:12.021
No offense,
but we just can't sit here any longer.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.481
We should wait.

12:13.607 --> 12:18.820
I agree with Jinx, we have to act
while we have an advantage.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.990
Let's say we do it your way,
what's the plan?

12:22.074 --> 12:25.869
We can use the prisoner to trick the enemy
into flying one of their pods down to us,

12:25.953 --> 12:27.370
then we hijack the pod,

12:27.455 --> 12:29.664
fly up to their base
and take them by surprise.

12:29.749 --> 12:34.085
Ahsoka, you got us
to believe in ourselves again,

12:34.170 --> 12:37.589
and, well, I believe Jinx's plan will work.

12:37.715 --> 12:39.007

12:39.091 --> 12:43.052
but O-Mer and I are leaving
with the prisoner in the morning.
