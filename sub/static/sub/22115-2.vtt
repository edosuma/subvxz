00:02.570 --> 00:04.405
Hi, I'm Jeffrey Tanner.

00:04.505 --> 00:06.207
Welcome to Sophe.

00:06.307 --> 00:08.276
We all know the Internet
changed the world.

00:08.376 --> 00:10.511
The only question is:
into what?

00:10.611 --> 00:12.146
It can be a platform
to bring us together

00:12.246 --> 00:13.647
or to tear us apart.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.083
I know, because I spent my life

00:15.816 --> 00:16.750
trying to turn it
into something

00:18.152 --> 00:19.287
that would connect us all.
Then...

00:20.354 --> 00:22.056
I love you, Dad.
...my daughter was murdered.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.191
Nothing else mattered anymore.

00:24.292 --> 00:25.726
Everyone was sure
they knew who did it--

00:25.759 --> 00:27.095
the police, my ex-wife--

00:28.396 --> 00:30.131
but I was convinced the wrong
man had been convicted

00:30.164 --> 00:31.765
and the real killer
was still out there.

00:31.799 --> 00:33.701
So together with my team,
I built Sophe,

00:33.734 --> 00:34.768
a crowdsource
crime solving platform

00:36.237 --> 00:38.038
powered by the smartest,
most diverse,

00:39.273 --> 00:41.041
independent collection of
detectives on the planet:

00:41.142 --> 00:43.377
you.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.279
Let's get to work.

00:45.379 --> 00:46.580
Previously on
Wisdom of the Crowd...

00:46.680 --> 00:48.082
ALEX:
You were a good dad.

00:48.182 --> 00:50.118
Please, just let this be over.

00:50.218 --> 00:51.519
TANNER:
Detective Cavanaugh.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.454
Thank you for coming.
I was sent.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.056
This guy was coming
out of Mia's apartment

00:56.157 --> 00:57.558
the night she was murdered.
Have you ever seen him before?

00:57.658 --> 00:59.193
Not that I can
remember.

00:59.293 --> 01:00.294
JOSH:
So who is it?

01:00.394 --> 01:01.429
The other guy.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.097
What's going on?
I got an alert.

01:03.664 --> 01:04.165
It's about another case.

01:04.665 --> 01:05.566
A serial
rapist.

01:06.634 --> 01:07.034
We always knew Sophe can solve
other crimes as well.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.503
Yes, eventually.

01:09.603 --> 01:12.106
People are responding.

01:12.206 --> 01:13.374
Look, one of the users
is posting the arrest.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.109
(applause)

01:15.209 --> 01:16.544
CAVANAUGH:
The state's decided

01:16.644 --> 01:19.113
not to reopen
your daughter's case.

01:19.213 --> 01:20.148
Not until we provide them
with enough evidence

01:20.248 --> 01:21.315
to force their hand.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.150
(evidence alert beeping)

01:26.187 --> 01:28.322
(evidence alert beeping)

01:47.908 --> 01:49.510
SARA:
What's wrong?

01:49.610 --> 01:51.512
Couldn't sleep?

01:53.414 --> 01:55.316
What's this?

01:55.416 --> 01:57.351
TANNER: This is the video
of the man coming out

01:57.451 --> 01:59.853
of Mia's apartment
the night she was murdered.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.555
And this is a new photo
someone just submitted.

02:04.258 --> 02:05.626
JOSH:
Hey, it's Josh from Sophe.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.361
Sorry to bother you so early,

02:07.461 --> 02:09.230
but I just want to ask
about that photo you sent us.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.532
Was that at, like, a
campus-wide party or...?

02:11.632 --> 02:13.534
No, it was the night that
Quentin Anastos

02:13.634 --> 02:14.902
was supposed to speak.

02:15.002 --> 02:17.137
The alt-right guy.
Fascist!

02:17.238 --> 02:18.406
DARIUS:
Yes, man, there was a protest.

02:18.506 --> 02:19.407
It was crazy.
Things got out of hand.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.175
Things got wild.

02:21.275 --> 02:22.610
But I took that picture

02:22.710 --> 02:24.278
way before that.

02:24.378 --> 02:26.146
He didn't even know
she was in the photo.

02:26.247 --> 02:27.581
Look, I didn't even know
who Mia Tanner was

02:27.681 --> 02:28.616
until we found out about Sophe.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.251
Look, we really do appreciate

02:30.351 --> 02:31.919
what you guys do with the,
you know,

02:32.019 --> 02:34.188
crowdsourcing thing...
People helping solve crimes.

02:34.288 --> 02:35.489
JOSH: Okay, thanks
for submitting this.

02:35.589 --> 02:36.857
Metadata checks out.

02:36.957 --> 02:39.193
Photo's from the
night of April 14.

02:39.293 --> 02:41.429
SARA: That's five months
before Mia was killed.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.231
Do you think it could be
the same man from the video?

02:43.331 --> 02:44.432
There's only one way
to find out.

02:46.334 --> 02:47.468
Post it.

02:51.405 --> 02:52.940
SARA:
"To Sophe users:

02:53.040 --> 02:55.843
Can you identify this man
with Mia?"

03:03.317 --> 03:05.419
*

03:15.028 --> 03:16.830
(elevator bell dings)

03:22.303 --> 03:23.637
Tanner, what
are you doing?

03:23.737 --> 03:25.973
You see that photo?
What photo?

03:26.073 --> 03:28.476
Detective, you were on Sophe
for 28 minutes last night.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.311
I know. I run it,
remember?
Fine.

03:30.411 --> 03:31.945
I saw the photo. Your
daughter with some guy

03:32.045 --> 03:33.314
who could be anybody.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.215
Or he could be the guy
from the video,

03:35.316 --> 03:37.318
the one walking out of her place
the night she was murdered.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.852
The department is not reopening
your daughter's case.

03:38.952 --> 03:40.988
I'm sorry.
Until we get
more evidence. Right?

03:41.088 --> 03:42.356
That's why
I need your help.

03:42.456 --> 03:43.491
My help?
Yes.

03:43.591 --> 03:44.592
What are we
talking about?

03:45.559 --> 03:47.695
That night, there was a protest
at Berkeley.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.530
Kids were arrested. He could
have been one of 'em.
(sighs)

03:49.563 --> 03:50.564
No.
I just need the records
from the Berkeley Police.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.266
No! You're not hearing me.

03:52.366 --> 03:54.268
(elevator bell dings)
I am off the case.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.570
I can't help you,
even if I wanted to.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.939
And all these people?
They don't want to.

03:59.039 --> 04:00.408
When it comes to your daughter,
all you've done

04:00.508 --> 04:02.410
is accuse them
of botching their jobs.

04:02.510 --> 04:03.544
And they don't like it.

04:03.644 --> 04:04.645
CAMILLE: That's
just not Antoine.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.246
He is a straight-A student.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.615
He was just studying
at the library.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.016
I understand,
Mrs. Reddick.

04:09.116 --> 04:10.451
Please, he'd never stay out
past his curfew.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.286
He never has.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.422
I promise you, we are
gonna do everything we can

04:14.522 --> 04:15.956
to help you
find your son.

04:16.056 --> 04:17.658
Would you take them to
the conference room, please?

04:19.393 --> 04:20.528
We'll find him.

04:20.628 --> 04:21.995
(sighs):
Come on.

04:24.365 --> 04:25.499
You can help me
get that evidence, right?
RUIZ: Tommy.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.368
You... eh...

04:27.468 --> 04:28.702
Give me a second.

04:28.802 --> 04:29.870
Yeah?

04:32.072 --> 04:33.407
Antoine Reddick.

04:34.475 --> 04:35.976
RUIZ: 13 years old.
He went missing last night.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.445
He's a freshman
at Cypress View Academy.

04:37.478 --> 04:38.312
At 13?
Well, he skipped a year.

04:39.046 --> 04:39.647
Some kind of
computer prodigy.

04:40.414 --> 04:41.949
He was supposed
to be studying

04:41.982 --> 04:42.916
at the school until
9:00 last night.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.318
When he wasn't
home by 10:00,

04:44.352 --> 04:45.586
they started tracking
his cell phone.

04:45.619 --> 04:46.954
CAVANAUGH: And?
And they found the cell phone,

04:46.987 --> 04:47.921
along with his backpack,
in the library.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.791
But the kid was gone.
This photo,

04:50.824 --> 04:51.959
in front of his school, that was
taken yesterday morning.

04:52.059 --> 04:52.860
That's the most recent.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.665
Come here, please.

04:57.765 --> 05:00.000
What is he doing here?

05:00.100 --> 05:01.569
He knows the department
shut him down, right?

05:01.669 --> 05:03.437
Yes, I told him.
Twice.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.305
All right, well, would you
please get rid of him?

05:05.406 --> 05:06.474
Because I need
you on this.

05:06.574 --> 05:07.708
Yeah.
Okay.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.443
Her son's missing?

05:09.543 --> 05:11.011
Yes, um, actually,

05:11.111 --> 05:12.646
it's something I
should be working on.

05:12.746 --> 05:13.914
Do you have kids,
Detective?

05:14.014 --> 05:15.082
What?

05:15.182 --> 05:16.917
Do you have kids?
No.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.586
No, you don't?
You don't have kids?
No, no, no, no.

05:18.686 --> 05:19.520
We're not having
this discussion.

05:19.620 --> 05:20.588
I have a job to do.

05:20.688 --> 05:22.423
Say, look, Tanner.

05:22.523 --> 05:23.991
You are a private citizen;
you can use Sophe

05:24.091 --> 05:26.093
to look into your
daughter's case,

05:26.193 --> 05:27.895
as long as you don't
violate people's rights.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.863
If you find something,
bring it to me.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.565
But in the meantime,

05:31.665 --> 05:33.701
the department's not
your partner on this.

05:33.801 --> 05:36.336
Meaning we're not, either.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.438
Mm. Okay.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.039
Good luck.

05:47.615 --> 05:50.984
Mrs. Reddick, um...
(crying)

05:51.084 --> 05:53.987
I know this is...
it's okay.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.557
It's all right.
(sobbing)

05:56.657 --> 05:58.992
I know.
I know.

06:01.462 --> 06:04.965
(muffled): I'm very sorry
for your loss, Mr. Tanner.

06:05.065 --> 06:08.001
I want you to know we are
pursing every lead we have.

06:26.454 --> 06:28.456
(camera snaps)

06:28.556 --> 06:29.990
(phone buzzes)

06:30.090 --> 06:31.158
What, did you spend
the night here?

06:31.258 --> 06:32.993
What?

06:33.093 --> 06:34.394
Usually only Tanner
gets in before me,

06:34.495 --> 06:35.996
and he lives upstairs.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.466
Plus, if I don't get here early,
someone takes my parking space!

06:38.566 --> 06:39.032
Are they reserved?

06:40.468 --> 06:42.102
SARA:
Boys, focus.

06:42.202 --> 06:43.170
We've got something.

06:43.270 --> 06:44.505
About Mia?

06:44.605 --> 06:45.639
No, something new.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.074
"Has anyone seen

06:47.174 --> 06:49.142
Antoine Reddick?"

06:58.486 --> 07:00.988
(indistinct chatter)

07:01.088 --> 07:03.190
(school bell rings)

07:07.027 --> 07:08.896
*

07:21.542 --> 07:23.143
That is why I'm proud
to join forces

07:23.243 --> 07:24.578
with our city leaders today

07:24.678 --> 07:26.880
to promote affordable
housing developments

07:26.980 --> 07:29.917
like this one,
for families in need.

07:30.017 --> 07:33.987
And I am very proud to be able
to say to Ana and her family,

07:34.087 --> 07:36.490
welcome home.

07:36.590 --> 07:38.526
Congratulations.
(applause)

07:40.894 --> 07:42.095
REPORTER:
Representative Hale,

07:42.195 --> 07:43.463
do you agree with you ex-husband

07:43.564 --> 07:44.732
that Carlos Ochoa is innocent?

07:44.832 --> 07:45.966
(clears throat)
We're here to talk

07:46.900 --> 07:47.701
about housing today,
so we'll stick to that.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.237
Representative!
Do you think
the police got the wrong man?

07:50.270 --> 07:52.072
Um, I'm not gonna...
Do you think that

07:52.105 --> 07:53.273
your daughter's killer
is still out there?
Uh, we're gonna...

07:53.306 --> 07:54.007
Thank you very much.
Excellent question.

07:54.808 --> 07:55.943
Have you visited
the Sophe website?

07:55.976 --> 07:56.877
Enough questions
for today, guys.

07:56.910 --> 07:57.645
Thank you very much for coming.

07:57.745 --> 07:58.746
What the hell was that?

07:58.846 --> 08:00.013
What did you
expect, Alex?

08:00.113 --> 08:01.682
You have to
address this.
Mm-mm.

08:02.983 --> 08:03.483
I'm gonna set up an interview
with the Oakland Chronicle.

08:04.417 --> 08:05.018
It'll be friendly,
they're very supportive.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.254
What am I supposed to say?
That I'm...
You're supposed to say

08:07.287 --> 08:08.121
that Jeffrey's been
wrong about all this.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.190
Right? You've been
divorced nine years,

08:10.223 --> 08:11.258
you don't owe him anything.
I... (scoffs)

08:11.291 --> 08:12.693
It's not about
owing him anything.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.595
I don't want anything
to do with this, okay?

08:14.695 --> 08:16.029
Let me ask you a question.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.030
Do you think Carlos
Ochoa is guilty?

08:19.232 --> 08:20.634
You know I think he's guilty.

08:20.734 --> 08:21.669
Okay, well, then
you need to say so.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.136
And you need to say it publicly.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.938
You are up for
reelection in a year.

08:25.038 --> 08:26.173
All right? This is not
the kind of distraction

08:26.273 --> 08:27.975
that we need right
now. And this--

08:28.075 --> 08:30.077
Sophe-- people love that
this site has caught

08:30.177 --> 08:31.612
two killers already, and the
more they start loving this,

08:32.746 --> 08:33.213
the more they're gonna start
to believe that Jeffrey's

08:34.281 --> 08:35.649
actually right and Mia's
killer is still out there.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.217
You have to deal
with this, Alex.

08:37.317 --> 08:39.286
They won't stop hounding
you until you do.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.122
CAVANAUGH:
We have the photo of Antoine

08:42.222 --> 08:44.191
out to all the local
law enforcement.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.093
We're gonna put it
on the news, on our Web site.

08:46.193 --> 08:47.595
What about an AMBER alert?

08:47.695 --> 08:49.262
Unfortunately,
that's just for when we know

08:49.362 --> 08:50.664
there's been an abduction

08:50.764 --> 08:51.665
and the child is in
imminent danger.

08:51.765 --> 08:53.533
He is in danger.

08:53.634 --> 08:54.534
I know it!

08:54.635 --> 08:56.303
(evidence alert beeping)

08:56.403 --> 08:57.638
What's going on?

08:57.738 --> 08:58.972
(Cavanaugh sighs)

08:59.072 --> 09:00.608
Uh, Tanner.

09:00.708 --> 09:01.709
Why is he still here?
I'm so sorry

09:02.943 --> 09:04.011
to interrupt you guys.
My name is Jeffrey Tanner.

09:04.044 --> 09:04.912
I know who you are.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.681
This man is not affiliated
with the department at all.

09:07.715 --> 09:08.816
Your son was wearing
a fitness tracker

09:08.849 --> 09:09.817
and it had a GPS in it.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.151
CAMILLE: Oh, yeah,
Antoine got that

09:11.251 --> 09:13.186
for his birthday.
You can track the GPS?

09:13.286 --> 09:15.022
I got a guy who can
do just about anything.

09:15.122 --> 09:16.724
Got it.
Sending to the police.

09:16.824 --> 09:18.091
Um, I think you're
a little late.

09:18.191 --> 09:19.292
SARA:
What do you mean?

09:19.392 --> 09:20.694
This is a user named
"ForceofWill."

09:21.829 --> 09:23.263
He posted something about
tracking the GPS on his own.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.249
(phone beeping)

09:42.349 --> 09:44.685
Um, hi. Is this "ForceofWill"?

09:44.785 --> 09:46.687
Just Will.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.021
Are you from Sophe?

09:48.121 --> 09:48.922
Yes, from Sophe.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.223
Dude, we see you
moving towards the area.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.358
You need to stay back.

09:51.458 --> 09:52.325
Just trying to help.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.394
Tell him the police
are on their way.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.163
Uh, I can hear you, actually.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.231
Oh, hold on.
I think I found something.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.269
SARA: That looks like
Antoine's jacket.

10:02.369 --> 10:03.303
Yeah,
there's the fitness tracker.

10:03.403 --> 10:04.237
And there's blood.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.673
Detective...

10:05.773 --> 10:07.240
One of our users
found the tracker

10:07.340 --> 10:09.142
and the sweatshirt
in the garbage.

10:09.242 --> 10:10.978
What?
CAMILLE:
Oh, my God.

10:11.078 --> 10:12.345
Mrs. Reddick...
Is that blood?!

10:12.445 --> 10:13.981
RUIZ: We don't know anything
for sure yet.

10:14.081 --> 10:15.348
Oh...
Please,

10:15.448 --> 10:17.350
you're the only reason
we know anything yet.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.686
Can you please help us?

10:18.786 --> 10:20.353
I-I, uh, my-my team,

10:20.453 --> 10:24.024
my team and I will do everything
we possibly can for you.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.059
As long as the police
are okay with it.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.763
Of course.

10:29.863 --> 10:31.231
Whatever it takes
to get your son back.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.033
(crying): Thank you.
Thank you.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.137
I guess we're partners
after all.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.916
What is this place anyway?
This is where we upload the data

10:49.016 --> 10:50.117
and monitor the platform.
I know you've already talked

10:50.217 --> 10:51.685
to the police, but I'm afraid

10:51.785 --> 10:53.320
there's a few more
questions to ask you.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.388
Even the smallest detail
can potentially be crucial.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.424
CAVANAUGH: You're just putting
it all out there as quick

10:57.524 --> 10:59.727
as your little fingers can type.
That's how it works, Detective.

10:59.827 --> 11:01.661
The crowd tells us
what's important.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.230
Well, it better tell us quick.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.164
This boy's been missing
for almost 16 hours.

11:04.898 --> 11:05.933
SARA:
You said Antoine

11:07.000 --> 11:08.435
was supposed to study
in the library until 9:00 p.m.

11:08.535 --> 11:10.403
Did he often
stay at school that late?

11:10.503 --> 11:13.673
Sometimes later. Cypress View
is very, very competitive.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.208
All right, what is all this?

11:15.308 --> 11:17.277
User-generated theories.

11:17.377 --> 11:20.447
And this tells us how likely
each one of those theories is.

11:20.547 --> 11:22.082
And who decides that?

11:22.182 --> 11:23.450
Sophe does, uh,
using a statistical formula

11:23.550 --> 11:25.118
called Bayes' theorem.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.987
It analyzes the
probability of an event

11:27.087 --> 11:29.122
based on our knowledge of the
conditions related to it.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.158
Do you actually
hear yourself talk?

11:31.258 --> 11:33.026
TANNER: Josh was
getting his second PhD

11:33.126 --> 11:35.095
in applied mathematics when
we stole him away from MIT.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.430
Oh. That explains so much.

11:37.530 --> 11:40.167
What about his online life?

11:40.267 --> 11:43.136
So, social media,
gaming, friends.

11:43.236 --> 11:44.371
No, he only is allowed
two hours of video games

11:44.471 --> 11:46.039
on the weekends,
that's it.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.307
Let's take a random
piece of data

11:47.407 --> 11:49.777
that Sara's getting
from the parents.

11:49.877 --> 11:53.246
Antoine plays only two hours
of video games per week.

11:53.346 --> 11:55.182
No 13-year-old I know does that.

11:55.282 --> 11:58.118
The crowd agrees with you.
Right here: 98%.

11:58.218 --> 12:01.054
Survey says: he used a school
server to set up extra accounts.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.956
That's what I'd do.
In fact, I did do that.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.124
JOSH:
And here, they're taking

12:04.224 --> 12:06.126
the username from
his fitness tracker

12:06.226 --> 12:08.028
and searching for
similar screen names.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.362
CAVANAUGH: "Slayer's
Code." What's that?

12:09.462 --> 12:12.299
Yeah, it's an MMORPG.

12:12.399 --> 12:15.168
Online game. You play it with
other people. Lots of people.

12:15.268 --> 12:16.469
Good work, everybody,
let's run it down.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.476
(footsteps approaching)

12:26.546 --> 12:29.216
(chuckles softly)

12:29.316 --> 12:30.517
Oh.

12:30.617 --> 12:33.954
Uh, could I get you something?

12:34.054 --> 12:38.125
I... Camille, she, uh,

12:38.225 --> 12:40.093
she wanted some tea.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.228
Of course.
(bottle thuds)

12:41.328 --> 12:43.196
Um, we got...
(clears throat)

12:46.033 --> 12:47.134
...chamomile, mint.

12:47.234 --> 12:48.501
Anything's fine.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.217
Camille and Antoine,

13:04.317 --> 13:07.487
they, uh...

13:07.587 --> 13:10.490
they've always had
this bond, you know?

13:12.592 --> 13:14.995
Mothers and their sons, right?

13:17.064 --> 13:18.031
Me...

13:20.233 --> 13:24.204
...I just wanted to show
him how to throw a ball.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.973
Dad stuff.

13:29.376 --> 13:32.980
I just wish that I, uh...

13:33.080 --> 13:34.447
I know.

13:34.547 --> 13:36.083
(water boiling)

13:36.183 --> 13:37.550
(alarm dings)

13:37.650 --> 13:39.519
(exhales)

13:44.424 --> 13:46.459
(quietly):
Here.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.361
You want a second chance.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.966
I hope you get one.

14:14.121 --> 14:15.088
(grunts)

14:17.424 --> 14:18.959
TARIQ:
Hey, Chief Wiggum.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.961
What do you want?

14:21.061 --> 14:22.262
Check this out,
I got something to show you.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.031
Besides, you don't want
to break that chair,

14:24.131 --> 14:25.165
it's expensive.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.067
I can't wait to arrest you.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.435
I got into the kid's account
on Slayer's Code.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.371
Don't have a cow, I asked
his parents' permission.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.540
Look, Antoine is being trolled
by somebody online.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.408
Here, see?

14:35.508 --> 14:38.078
"Bloodstone667." It's a board
of Bay Area players,

14:38.178 --> 14:40.247
so everybody's local.
Listen to this:

14:40.347 --> 14:43.050
"I know where to find you,
and when I do I will hurt you."

14:43.150 --> 14:44.617
You forgot the part where he
says: "You're a piece of..."
Yeah, no.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.254
I can read what it says.

14:47.354 --> 14:50.490
Question is, who the hell
is "Bloodstone667?"

14:50.590 --> 14:52.225
His name is Wayne Ruhl,
and he lives in...

14:52.325 --> 14:54.527
What, yeah-- yo!
We talked about this.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.997
Who the hell are you hacking?
I didn't hack
anyone, dude, I swear.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.265
My cousin works
for the game developer

14:58.365 --> 15:00.067
and he owes me a favor.

15:00.167 --> 15:02.135
Just don't tell anyone,
or he'll get fired.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.404
And possibly deported.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.539
CAVANAUGH: Hey,
this is Detective Cavanaugh.

15:06.639 --> 15:10.010
I need you to run a check
on a Wayne Ruhl.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.514
(door opens)

15:14.614 --> 15:16.449
Is the skyline still there?

15:18.618 --> 15:19.987
(sighs)
What do you got there?

15:22.155 --> 15:23.490
You brought it in here.
Don't pretend

15:23.590 --> 15:25.092
like you don't want me
to see it.

15:25.192 --> 15:27.227
It's our operating expenses.

15:27.327 --> 15:28.495
And this is just from
this last month, Jeffrey.

15:28.595 --> 15:30.998
It's a lot.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.499
And it doesn't help that
you brought everybody in here

15:32.599 --> 15:34.201
at the crack of dawn
this morning.

15:34.301 --> 15:35.502
We had a piece
of new evidence, Mike.

15:35.602 --> 15:36.536
We had to run it down.

15:36.636 --> 15:39.306
Why? Was it going somewhere?

15:39.406 --> 15:41.041
The overtime on that alone,
Jeffrey, it's gonna kill us.

15:41.141 --> 15:43.176
We've been through this.
I get it. Enough.

15:43.276 --> 15:44.577
But we're
hemorrhaging money, Jeffrey.

15:44.677 --> 15:47.147
So unless you can find
some way to monetize all this,

15:47.247 --> 15:48.215
we're in a lot of trouble.

15:48.315 --> 15:49.282
I wouldn't...
SARA: Hey.

15:50.483 --> 15:51.618
I'm sorry.

15:51.718 --> 15:53.620
Am I interrupting something?

15:53.720 --> 15:55.455
Actually, yes. Ac...
He was just leaving.

15:55.555 --> 15:57.157
Weren't you, Mike?

15:57.257 --> 15:59.359
Sure. Yeah.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.527
Why not?

16:00.627 --> 16:02.229
We'll finish this later.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.297
I... That we will. Thank you.

16:06.199 --> 16:07.500
What's up?
It's about Mia.

16:07.600 --> 16:10.003
People are posting photos

16:10.103 --> 16:11.571
from the protest
that happened that night.

16:11.671 --> 16:12.639
Is she in any of them?

16:12.739 --> 16:14.307
Unfortunately not.

16:14.407 --> 16:16.109
And neither is anyone dressed

16:16.209 --> 16:17.244
like the man we're looking for.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.146
R-Right there. Hold on, go back.

16:19.246 --> 16:20.613
(keyboard clicking)
Okay, that's Lori Meyers.

16:20.713 --> 16:22.215
That's Mia's friend.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.217
Yeah, she gave us
that voicemail,

16:24.317 --> 16:26.353
the night she was murdered.
So, if she was at the protest,

16:26.453 --> 16:28.355
he could've been there,
and maybe she saw him.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.990
Hey. We got a lead.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.225
Antoine's being trolled
by some guy online

16:32.325 --> 16:33.493
who's got a record.

16:33.593 --> 16:34.527
What's the record?

16:34.627 --> 16:36.129
Violent assault,

16:36.229 --> 16:37.497
and a sex offense with a minor.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.132
I'll keep you posted.

16:45.538 --> 16:48.108
BOY:
No, get off of me!

16:48.208 --> 16:51.010
WAYNE: Get back here,
you little punk!

16:51.111 --> 16:52.512
Let's go around back.
Yeah.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.013
Hold the front.

16:56.549 --> 16:59.152
WAYNE: Come on!
BOY: No!

16:59.252 --> 17:00.253
WAYNE:
Take your punishment!

17:00.353 --> 17:02.355
Get...
BOY: Get off of me!

17:02.455 --> 17:04.124
Get off of me!
No! No!

17:04.224 --> 17:05.392
WAYNE:
Do it now!

17:05.492 --> 17:07.594
Police! Show me your hands now!

17:07.694 --> 17:09.096
I didn't do anything!

17:09.196 --> 17:10.197
I'm-I'm complying!

17:10.297 --> 17:11.264
I'm complying!

17:11.364 --> 17:13.366
(video game beeping)

17:13.466 --> 17:15.635
BOY (over TV):
Ha, ha, I got you.

17:15.735 --> 17:18.071
Who's beat now, sucker?

17:18.171 --> 17:19.406
Hey, that's a new high score.

17:21.541 --> 17:24.043
(sighs) Sir, can you
put on some pants, please?

17:29.249 --> 17:30.450
You threatened Antoine Reddick.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.452
Online. But I never
touched him. Oh-- see?

17:32.552 --> 17:34.387
Ankle bracelet.
Everything I do is-is tracked.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.323
CAVANAUGH: So what
was your beef with this kid?

17:36.423 --> 17:38.791
He is a punk.
And he's ripping people off.

17:38.891 --> 17:39.759
The hell are you talking about?

17:39.859 --> 17:41.728
The game lets you buy and sell

17:41.828 --> 17:43.363
virtual artifacts online.

17:43.463 --> 17:46.199
Swords, shields, potions,
stuff like that.

17:46.299 --> 17:48.201
But when a scumbag
like that kid,

17:48.301 --> 17:49.469
you know,
he overcharges people,

17:50.537 --> 17:52.339
then-then there's confusion
in the marketplace.

17:52.439 --> 17:53.773
So Antoine cheated you?

17:53.873 --> 17:56.509
No, not me, because
I'm a discerning collector.

17:56.609 --> 17:59.379
But what if some newb came along
and bought Antoine's crap?

17:59.479 --> 18:00.647
Then I didn't get
the chance to sell them

18:00.747 --> 18:02.382
the genuine article,
and that's stealing.

18:02.482 --> 18:04.184
I-It's just
stealing.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.653
JOSH: $500 for
a Bone Axe?

18:06.753 --> 18:09.389
Kid's bold.
Got to respect that.
So is 500 a lot?

18:09.489 --> 18:10.723
Yeah, it's an item
that's worth, like, six bucks.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.292
I mean, who would pay this much?

18:12.392 --> 18:13.626
TARIQ:
Maybe a newb.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.762
Unless-- look.
The overpriced items

18:15.862 --> 18:18.165
have these letters and numbers
in the description.

18:18.265 --> 18:18.798
I don't think that's
a syntax error.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.367
Could be hexadecimal code.

18:21.201 --> 18:21.468
SARA: Maybe it's a
secret message,

18:22.469 --> 18:23.370
telling the buyer what
the item actually was.

18:24.036 --> 18:24.637
So what was Antoine selling?

18:24.737 --> 18:26.373
I don't know.

18:26.473 --> 18:28.375
But I think Sophe
has a theory on how to find out.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.377
JOSH: These users
are saying hexadecimal

18:30.477 --> 18:32.379
converted to Base64.
TARIQ:
Sure.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.347
2008 called,
they want their code back.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.483
Okay. What are we
talking about, guys?

18:36.583 --> 18:38.651
Antoine was literally
writing in code.

18:38.751 --> 18:39.619
Computer code.

18:44.191 --> 18:45.225
JOSH:
"AP U.S. History,

18:45.325 --> 18:46.526
"Chemistry,

18:46.626 --> 18:48.161
Calc B.C.," they're classes.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.496
Let's buy one, see what it is.

18:49.596 --> 18:50.430
As long as Tanner's paying.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.767
Exam answers?
JOSH:
Makes sense.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.169
These kids are under
so much pressure for grades.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.437
SARA:
Antoine must have

18:57.537 --> 18:59.539
figured out how to hack
the school servers

18:59.639 --> 19:01.641
and steal the answers.
TARIQ: Only
three usernames

19:01.741 --> 19:03.410
bought the coded items.
How much do you want to bet

19:03.510 --> 19:04.511
they're Antoine's classmates?

19:06.746 --> 19:08.548
TANNER: What about
this guy, Lori?
LORI: Um...

19:08.648 --> 19:10.650
You see anyone at the protest
with a hoodie like that?

19:10.750 --> 19:13.353
I don't think so,

19:13.453 --> 19:15.154
but I might not remember.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.324
You know, it... the
whole night was nuts.

19:17.424 --> 19:19.659
Black bloc demonstrators showed
up and all hell broke loose.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.361
TANNER:
Was Mia there?

19:21.461 --> 19:23.763
LORI: No. Mia never made it
to the protest.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.299
I know. I saw her later that
night and I told her about it.

19:26.399 --> 19:27.634
What about this guy?
You think that he could be

19:27.734 --> 19:30.337
the "secret boyfriend"
that Mia talked about?

19:30.437 --> 19:32.372
I-I wouldn't know.
I never met him.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.341
TANNER:
How can you be so sure

19:34.441 --> 19:37.277
that t-the secret boyfriend
isn't Carlos Ochoa?

19:37.377 --> 19:39.346
Because Carlos wasn't a secret.

19:39.446 --> 19:41.614
Mia talked about
him all the time.

19:41.714 --> 19:44.684
The other guy, whoever he was,
that was different.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.353
One day, she was head
over heels for him,

19:46.453 --> 19:47.954
then the next,
she was terrified.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.956
She was gonna
cut it off,

19:50.056 --> 19:52.392
but then, um...

19:52.492 --> 19:53.560
This is my class...
One more, one more quick thing.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.628
"Sports shop."

19:55.728 --> 19:56.563
You said something to the
detec-detectives about...?

19:57.297 --> 19:58.197
Yeah, that was
just something

19:59.131 --> 20:00.533
I heard Mia say to him
on the phone once.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.569
What do you think it meant?
I don't know.

20:02.669 --> 20:05.405
I asked Mia, but she just smiled
and said it was a family thing.

20:05.505 --> 20:06.739
That's it?

20:06.839 --> 20:09.442
That's all she said?

20:09.542 --> 20:13.780
The truth is,
Mia could be secretive.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.449
She was conflicted
about her life,

20:16.549 --> 20:18.451
all the money you had.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.521
I think that's why she went
into social work, though.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.623
She found meaning
by helping people.

20:23.723 --> 20:27.294
But sometimes,
she just dealt with it all

20:27.394 --> 20:30.297
by keeping things
to herself.

20:31.698 --> 20:33.300
(quietly):
Okay.

20:38.004 --> 20:38.971
(mouse clicks)

20:51.351 --> 20:53.520
MARIA: You're hurt.
What happened?

20:53.620 --> 20:55.288
CARLOS: It's not
a big deal, Ma.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.490
It's fine.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.726
(speaks Spanish)

21:07.667 --> 21:09.802
Ah, come on,
don't start.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.371
Hey, you're gone get yourself
worked up, okay? Don't do that.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.341
Ma, come on.

21:14.441 --> 21:15.808
The appeals court,
and all of that, they...

21:15.908 --> 21:17.510
they're just going
through the motions, they...

21:17.610 --> 21:19.446
You're wrong. Look at this.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.448
Jeffrey Tanner's
trying to help you.

21:21.548 --> 21:24.283
Ma, it's just a waste of time.
Nothing's gonna come of...

21:24.384 --> 21:25.418
No!

21:25.518 --> 21:26.453
Wait, wait.
Let me see that again.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.392
GUARD: Hey.

21:32.492 --> 21:33.460
No phones.

21:42.068 --> 21:43.670
I don't know.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.009
Doesn't matter anyway.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.415
I love you, Ma.

21:55.515 --> 21:56.749
TANNER: This is supposed
to be the sports shop thread.

21:56.849 --> 21:58.685
What is "svorzando"?

21:58.785 --> 22:00.587
It's a type of
musical notation,

22:00.687 --> 22:03.423
or there's a Café t'Zwart
Schaap in Amsterdam,

22:03.523 --> 22:05.324
a bar in Sacramento
called The Sports Stop.

22:05.425 --> 22:06.993
It feels like every time
we take a step forward,

22:07.093 --> 22:08.428
we've taken two steps back.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.363
Just give it time.

22:10.463 --> 22:12.064
Sophe will find something.

22:15.034 --> 22:17.437
You talk to the parents?

22:17.537 --> 22:19.572
Yeah. They're hanging in there.

22:19.672 --> 22:23.443
I didn't know what
to say to him before.

22:23.543 --> 22:26.713
He wanted to know
how to deal with it.

22:26.813 --> 22:29.115
The truth is, you don't.

22:29.215 --> 22:32.452
It's like a black hole.

22:32.552 --> 22:34.421
It swallows up everything
you thought you were.

22:34.521 --> 22:35.822
But you didn't let it.

22:35.922 --> 22:37.590
You took all that emptiness

22:37.690 --> 22:39.792
and you built
something with it.

22:39.892 --> 22:41.828
You built this.

22:41.928 --> 22:44.697
And this matters, Jeffrey.

22:44.797 --> 22:47.099
It really does.

22:51.471 --> 22:54.006
How did you get so good
at talking me off the ledge?

22:57.810 --> 23:00.112
Don't you know?

23:00.212 --> 23:03.015
I climbed out there
with you, silly.

23:06.686 --> 23:08.120
(cell phone buzzing)

23:12.792 --> 23:15.161
(whispering):
Thank you.

23:15.261 --> 23:16.629
Hey.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.598
Hey.

23:21.468 --> 23:23.570
Did you need something?

23:23.670 --> 23:25.004
Nope.

23:29.809 --> 23:31.478
Got a minute?

23:31.578 --> 23:32.645
Sure.

23:32.745 --> 23:33.613
Excuse me.

23:44.156 --> 23:46.626
I want to talk
about your contract.

23:46.726 --> 23:48.427
I don't have a contract.

23:48.528 --> 23:49.762
Exactly.

23:49.862 --> 23:52.064
And I think that you should...

23:52.164 --> 23:54.166
with an appropriate raise,
of course.

24:00.707 --> 24:04.110
Sir...
He's good. He's with me.

24:04.210 --> 24:05.578
Found all the kids
from his school,

24:05.678 --> 24:07.580
but they're not
saying anything.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.116
More worried about getting in
trouble than helping Antoine.

24:10.216 --> 24:11.484
Parents?

24:11.584 --> 24:12.552
Yeah.

24:12.652 --> 24:13.720
Tanner.

24:13.820 --> 24:16.222
Hey, everybody.

24:16.322 --> 24:17.590
You know who I am?

24:17.690 --> 24:19.058
Uh, yeah.

24:19.158 --> 24:21.561
Okay, everybody knows who I am?
All right.

24:21.661 --> 24:23.029
Then you know that
I'm on the board

24:23.129 --> 24:24.597
or know someone on the board
at every college

24:24.697 --> 24:26.866
that you ever dreamt
that your kid would get into,

24:26.966 --> 24:29.802
every school that they were
willing to cheat to get into,

24:29.902 --> 24:31.470
and I will make it my mission

24:31.571 --> 24:33.472
to make sure that
they are blackballed

24:33.573 --> 24:35.474
from every single
one of them,

24:35.575 --> 24:36.743
unless they tell the police

24:37.810 --> 24:39.211
everything that they know
about Antoine Reddick.

24:39.311 --> 24:40.680
All right?

24:40.780 --> 24:42.248
Whose kid's up first? You?

24:42.348 --> 24:45.017
Great. Let's get into it.

24:47.153 --> 24:48.487
Antoine's the smartest kid
I know.

24:48.588 --> 24:49.589
He didn't even need the answers.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.257
So why did he steal them?

24:51.357 --> 24:53.092
I don't know.
Uh, to make some money?

24:53.192 --> 24:55.595
Plus Antoine is kind
of a dork, you know?

24:55.695 --> 24:57.063
Hooking us up was like a way
for him to fit in.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.631
All right, so, what happened
yesterday, Warren?

24:58.731 --> 25:00.833
You had the chemistry
test, then what?

25:00.933 --> 25:02.769
Uh, we aced it and we took
Antoine out to celebrate.

25:02.869 --> 25:05.171
So, he was with you?
WARREN:
Well, yeah, he...

25:05.271 --> 25:07.574
he-he left his phone.
I-I-It was in the library.

25:07.674 --> 25:09.175
He left it so that his
parents wouldn't track it.

25:09.275 --> 25:10.777
CAVANAUGH: Then why did
we find his sweatshirt

25:10.877 --> 25:13.646
in the Tenderloin
with blood all over it?

25:13.746 --> 25:15.181
There's a liquor store there
that doesn't card.

25:15.281 --> 25:16.515
H-He never even
had a beer before.

25:16.616 --> 25:18.284
H-He cut himself
opening the bottle.

25:18.384 --> 25:20.553
The blood got on the sweatshirt

25:20.653 --> 25:22.722
a-and we didn't want to make
a mess in Kevin's dad's car,

25:22.822 --> 25:23.756
so we just left it.

25:23.856 --> 25:25.057
So, what happened then?

25:25.157 --> 25:26.759
Where did you go?

25:26.859 --> 25:29.028
Uh, Kevin's parents
own a weekend house

25:29.128 --> 25:30.597
in Marin, up
by Muir Woods.

25:30.697 --> 25:32.064
It's where we go to party.

25:32.164 --> 25:34.133
Uh, a-after a
while, Antoine,

25:34.233 --> 25:36.068
he started freaking out.

25:36.168 --> 25:37.536
He said he had to get home,

25:37.637 --> 25:38.771
but we were way too wasted
to drive him.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.740
So what did he do?
I don't know.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.108
I-I passed out.

25:42.208 --> 25:43.175
We all did.

25:43.275 --> 25:45.612
In the morning,
he was gone.

25:47.780 --> 25:49.215
I ran the landline
from the house.

25:49.315 --> 25:51.050
Only three calls
were made last night.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.786
Pizza delivery place,
one of the kids' girlfriends,

25:53.886 --> 25:56.255
and the last went to a kid
named Finn Radnor.

25:56.355 --> 25:57.657
Does that name ring a bell?

25:57.757 --> 25:59.258
Finn goes to
Antoine's school.

25:59.358 --> 26:01.127
He's a few years ahead of him,
but...

26:01.227 --> 26:02.729
So maybe Antoine
called Finn for a ride.

26:02.829 --> 26:03.696
Let's talk to him.

26:07.166 --> 26:09.301
It's crazy.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.303
What?

26:13.673 --> 26:15.742
How could Antoine have
this whole secret life

26:15.842 --> 26:17.143
we knew nothing about?

26:17.243 --> 26:19.345
Stealing tests?
Skipping school?

26:19.445 --> 26:21.848
No. You do what you can
for your kids.

26:21.948 --> 26:24.150
After that...

26:27.353 --> 26:29.656
Trust me,
I'm not the one to ask.

26:36.362 --> 26:38.330
Can you excuse us
for a second?

26:43.770 --> 26:46.973
Thank you.

26:47.073 --> 26:48.841
Something up?
You tell me.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.711
(clears throat)

26:51.811 --> 26:54.647
How'd you know?

26:54.747 --> 26:55.682
"Know"?

26:55.782 --> 26:58.851
You offered Sara a raise.

26:58.951 --> 27:01.754
When was the last time you
offered anyone a raise?

27:01.854 --> 27:03.723
Voluntarily?

27:03.823 --> 27:06.859
I saw the two of you
together earlier.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.995
It was just a little moment,
but...

27:09.095 --> 27:09.996
I could tell...
And you think what?

27:10.096 --> 27:11.931
She's gonna hold

27:12.031 --> 27:13.399
the company hostage

27:13.499 --> 27:15.802
if the relationship
goes sideways?

27:15.902 --> 27:17.837
Well, it's a concern, yes.

27:17.937 --> 27:19.338
All right, look, you-you pay me
to be concerned, remember?

27:19.438 --> 27:22.008
When I found Sara
at Stanford,

27:22.108 --> 27:24.677
she was doing groundbreaking
work in crowdsourcing,

27:24.777 --> 27:27.747
the exact type of work
that we need Sophe to do.

27:27.847 --> 27:31.650
Mia died.

27:31.751 --> 27:34.821
Everything... fell apart.

27:34.921 --> 27:36.689
And...

27:36.789 --> 27:41.393
the relationship,
it just happened.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.395
In all those years
that I was away from Alex,

27:43.495 --> 27:44.897
I never thought that
I would meet someone

27:44.997 --> 27:48.300
that I would feel that way
about again.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.703
Well, that's amazing.

27:50.803 --> 27:53.005
I just... why do you feel like
you got to keep it a secret?

27:53.105 --> 27:57.877
Because I want her to get credit
for the work that she does,

27:57.977 --> 27:59.879
(quietly): not because she's
sleeping with the boss.

27:59.979 --> 28:03.449
You know how difficult it is
for women in Silicon Valley.

28:03.549 --> 28:07.353
And the truth is,
I wasn't ready.

28:07.453 --> 28:09.989
But we're-we're getting there.

28:10.089 --> 28:12.959
(sighs) I still don't know
what you're doing here, Jeffrey.

28:13.059 --> 28:14.761
And I don't know
if you're ever gonna find

28:14.861 --> 28:16.095
what it is that
you're looking for,

28:16.195 --> 28:18.297
at-at least not
before you go bankrupt,

28:18.397 --> 28:20.466
but...

28:20.566 --> 28:23.870
when I saw you with her...

28:23.970 --> 28:25.404
you looked whole.

28:25.504 --> 28:28.941
I just want
to keep you that way.

28:29.041 --> 28:32.378
That's all.

28:32.478 --> 28:33.479
All right.

28:49.461 --> 28:51.730
(groans lightly)

28:56.035 --> 28:58.504
(under breath):
"ConcernedMom. Concerned..."

29:00.973 --> 29:02.942
Oh, crap. Come on.

29:03.042 --> 29:06.478
(sighs)

29:06.578 --> 29:09.315
(under breath):
"ConcernedMom17."

29:09.415 --> 29:12.751
And...

29:12.852 --> 29:13.786
Okay.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.498
MIA:
Mom, I told you this already.

29:26.598 --> 29:28.400
I'm not doing pictures.

29:28.500 --> 29:29.101
ALEX:
Before you leave, come on.

29:29.201 --> 29:30.436
Mom, no.

29:30.536 --> 29:32.972
Mom, you have enough photos.

29:33.072 --> 29:35.107
ALEX: I can never have enough
pictures of you.

29:35.207 --> 29:37.143
Mia, Mia. Stop.

29:37.243 --> 29:38.410
(laughing):
Okay.

29:38.510 --> 29:39.912
Okay. I'm smiling. I'm smiling.

29:40.012 --> 29:41.147
ALEX:
I love you so much.

29:41.247 --> 29:42.448
Love you, too.
(laughs)

29:43.049 --> 29:45.017
(cries)

30:00.933 --> 30:02.902
(under breath):
Oh, my God.

30:16.348 --> 30:18.117
(door opens)
DAVID: Hey.

30:18.217 --> 30:20.119
Hey.
Just got off the phone
with the editor.

30:20.219 --> 30:21.153
You're all set
for the interview tonight.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.022
Great.
Okay.

30:23.122 --> 30:24.423
You're gonna do great.

30:26.392 --> 30:29.028
(school bell rings)

30:37.904 --> 30:39.605
Finn Radnor?

30:39.705 --> 30:41.908
Yeah?

30:42.008 --> 30:44.043
San Francisco PD.

30:44.143 --> 30:46.578
We were hoping to ask you a few
questions about Antoine Reddick.

30:46.678 --> 30:49.115
I didn't mean to hurt him.

30:49.215 --> 30:50.482
It was an accident. I swear it.

30:52.318 --> 30:53.886
We're here because we want

30:53.986 --> 30:55.121
to make sure Antoine
gets home safe

30:55.221 --> 30:56.355
and we think you do, too.

30:56.455 --> 30:58.124
I think it's too late.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.926
What do you mean,
"it's too late"?

31:00.026 --> 31:01.593
FINN:
I mean...

31:01.693 --> 31:05.431
he said he was at a party
and that he needed a ride,

31:05.531 --> 31:08.600
so I borrowed my dad's car
and went out to get him.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.570
I couldn't understand what he
was doing with those guys.

31:11.670 --> 31:14.040
They're such tools and there's
no way they actually like him.

31:14.140 --> 31:16.408
That's when he told me.

31:16.508 --> 31:19.411
About the exam answers?

31:19.511 --> 31:20.579
FINN: Those guys
were just using him.

31:20.679 --> 31:22.481
And he was, like,
bragging to me

31:22.581 --> 31:24.917
about-about throwing
off the curve.

31:25.017 --> 31:26.085
Okay, I'm sorry?

31:26.185 --> 31:27.954
"Throwing off the curve"?

31:28.054 --> 31:29.521
It's everyone against everyone
at my school.

31:29.621 --> 31:31.557
The Ivies only take
a few of us a year.

31:31.657 --> 31:36.062
Antoine was-was helping
those idiots take my spot.

31:36.162 --> 31:39.165
I can see how that
could make you mad.

31:39.265 --> 31:43.369
That's when I, I pulled over.

31:43.469 --> 31:45.104
I told him to get out
of the car.

31:45.204 --> 31:47.473
Then we got into a fight

31:47.573 --> 31:50.609
and he got scared
and ran off.

31:50.709 --> 31:52.111
I was just trying
to stop him

31:52.211 --> 31:53.912
and then he kicked me.

31:54.013 --> 31:55.948
Like, hard.

31:56.048 --> 31:59.551
I pushed him. I mean, it was
just like-like a reflex,

31:59.651 --> 32:01.620
but...

32:03.689 --> 32:06.125
...he was...

32:06.225 --> 32:08.995
he was standing at the edge
of this, like...

32:09.095 --> 32:11.163
ravine and...

32:11.263 --> 32:12.931
then he was just gone.

32:15.067 --> 32:16.535
I looked for him.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.370
I called his name,
but I couldn't see him.

32:20.739 --> 32:23.575
(exhales) I'm applying to Yale--
you-you understand?

32:23.675 --> 32:25.411
This could ruin my whole future.

32:28.180 --> 32:30.149
(birds squawking)

32:39.025 --> 32:41.527
Are you sure this is the spot?

32:41.627 --> 32:44.463
It's where the kid said
he went over.

32:44.563 --> 32:45.697
Captain, look at this.

32:48.734 --> 32:49.635
Hold on.

32:56.708 --> 32:59.011
You said he was
wearing plaid shorts?

32:59.111 --> 33:00.579
Did he survive the fall?

33:00.679 --> 33:02.448
HEATON:
Yeah, it looks like it.

33:02.548 --> 33:06.352
But in the dark, he'd have
no idea which way to go.

33:08.354 --> 33:10.589
Antoine!

33:10.689 --> 33:13.359
(echoing):
Antoine Reddick!

33:15.594 --> 33:17.363
Antoine!

33:28.274 --> 33:30.542
(distant siren wailing)

33:34.646 --> 33:37.349
HEATON: We've only got
an hour of daylight left.

33:37.449 --> 33:39.151
Let's move, people!
We got helicopters?

33:39.251 --> 33:40.752
Nah. Grounded due to fog.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.088
We're gonna have to do this
the old-fashioned way.

33:42.188 --> 33:44.190
ELI: Sir?
CAMILLE: Excuse me.

33:44.290 --> 33:45.757
Any information...
Sir, please, can you
tell us anything? Please!

33:45.857 --> 33:48.160
Hey, Captain,
let me talk to you for a second.

33:48.260 --> 33:50.162
What's he talking
about helicopters?
I don't know.

33:50.262 --> 33:52.198
TANNER:
Detective?

33:52.298 --> 33:53.632
So this is the great outdoors
I heard so much about.

33:53.732 --> 33:55.101
Feels overrated.

33:55.201 --> 33:57.069
Tanner, we appreciate
your moral support.

33:57.169 --> 33:58.704
Look, we got this.
Who are you?

33:58.804 --> 34:00.206
Nice to meet you, too.

34:00.306 --> 34:01.773
He's with me.

34:01.873 --> 34:04.376
I got a laptop here
with a satellite link.

34:04.476 --> 34:05.544
Tanner, what are you doing?
Thank you, sir.

34:05.644 --> 34:07.613
I think that we can help.

34:08.680 --> 34:10.649
Hive, Hive, are you there?

34:10.749 --> 34:12.084
SARA:
Yes. We're getting you.

34:12.184 --> 34:13.152
What can we do, Detective?

34:13.252 --> 34:14.686
CAVANAUGH: Unless you can
stop time, not much.

34:14.786 --> 34:16.655
Look, once the sun
goes down,

34:16.755 --> 34:18.590
they can walk right past him
and never know it.

34:18.690 --> 34:20.759
Look, Tanner, we got to let
Search and Rescue do their jobs.

34:20.859 --> 34:22.128
Okay?

34:22.228 --> 34:23.262
JOSH:
Act-Actually...

34:24.196 --> 34:25.264
I-I think Sophe can help
refine the search.

34:25.364 --> 34:27.166
CAVANAUGH:
How?

34:27.266 --> 34:28.600
JOSH: Well,
a traditional grid search

34:28.700 --> 34:29.635
could take hours, even days.

34:29.735 --> 34:31.603
But remember I told you
about Bayes' theorem?

34:31.703 --> 34:32.704
Now, we can
use that here, too,

34:32.804 --> 34:33.705
to update our hypotheses

34:33.805 --> 34:35.374
based on changing information.

34:35.474 --> 34:37.609
SARA: We give users
all the information we have,

34:37.709 --> 34:38.744
and ask them to estimate things
like how far

34:38.844 --> 34:40.712
Antoine could have traveled
given the conditions,

34:40.812 --> 34:42.314
or what direction he would go.

34:42.414 --> 34:43.382
JOSH:
Then we take that information

34:43.482 --> 34:44.583
to model the path Antoine

34:44.683 --> 34:46.185
would most likely have taken

34:47.386 --> 34:48.254
and create a probability map
of where he ought to be now.

34:48.354 --> 34:50.289
Meaning what?

34:50.389 --> 34:51.623
We can be smarter.

34:51.723 --> 34:53.292
What do you think?

34:54.560 --> 34:55.694
How the hell can the crowd help
us find a boy lost in the woods?

34:56.628 --> 34:57.796
SARA: Well,
that depends on your crowd.

34:58.730 --> 34:59.798
I'm sending a push
to a subset of users,

35:00.766 --> 35:01.533
using their hobbies
and occupations, so--

35:02.468 --> 35:03.535
hikers, climatologists,
mountain climbers,

35:03.635 --> 35:04.803
park rangers...

35:06.272 --> 35:08.874
(phone beeping)

35:11.343 --> 35:12.544
Hey, what are we doing?

35:12.644 --> 35:13.779
Well...

35:13.879 --> 35:15.614
the dots represent
user theories.

35:15.714 --> 35:17.149
And the white area?

35:17.249 --> 35:19.385
TANNER: Their hot zone.
This is approximate.

35:19.485 --> 35:22.288
Accounting for variables,
that's where he should be.

35:22.388 --> 35:23.789
All right, Heaton. Heaton?

35:23.889 --> 35:25.224
Look, that's just
people guessing.

35:25.324 --> 35:26.825
JOSH:
A-Actually, it isn't.

35:26.925 --> 35:28.394
Um, any one person is guessing,

35:28.494 --> 35:30.128
but when we put
those guesses together,

35:30.229 --> 35:31.563
it becomes something more.

35:31.663 --> 35:33.232
That's Bayes' theorem at work.

35:33.332 --> 35:35.834
Update with reports from the
ground, account for variables...

35:35.934 --> 35:38.170
SARA:
And you should be bloody close.

35:38.270 --> 35:39.638
Look, we're almost
out of time, guys.

35:39.738 --> 35:41.540
Then what do we have to lose?

35:41.640 --> 35:42.774
CAVANAUGH:
I know it sounds crazy, man,

35:42.874 --> 35:44.243
but please, one team.

35:44.343 --> 35:45.611
I'm asking for one team.

35:53.819 --> 35:55.921
R-3, this is
Rescue Leader.

35:56.021 --> 35:59.325
Please head half a klick west
by a half a klick south.

35:59.425 --> 36:01.227
VOLUNTEER:
Half a klick west

36:01.327 --> 36:02.894
by half a click south, copy.

36:02.994 --> 36:04.162
Antoine Reddick!

36:04.263 --> 36:06.398
Antoine!

36:06.498 --> 36:08.166
Antoine Reddick!

36:08.267 --> 36:10.202
Antoine!

36:10.302 --> 36:11.703
VOLUNTEER:
Stand by, base.

36:11.803 --> 36:14.806
Approaching the location now.

36:14.906 --> 36:16.808
We're scouring
the whole vicinity, but...

36:16.908 --> 36:18.810
negative.
There's no one here.

36:18.910 --> 36:20.646
What? No, no,
that should have worked.

36:22.948 --> 36:24.650
Any other great ideas?

36:24.750 --> 36:26.352
Guys, I'm gonna
send you

36:26.452 --> 36:27.553
in the east direction
at this point.

36:39.698 --> 36:40.799
The rain...

36:40.899 --> 36:42.934
What?
The rain.

36:43.034 --> 36:46.204
Satellite photos are updated
every one to three years.

36:46.305 --> 36:47.739
So the photos that
everyone is using...

36:47.839 --> 36:49.641
BOTH:
Were taken during the drought.

36:49.741 --> 36:51.277
HEATON: There's been at
least five riverbeds

36:51.377 --> 36:52.678
that have filled up in
the last six months.

36:54.780 --> 36:55.947
Adjusting the data set.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.317
(typing rapidly)

37:09.027 --> 37:10.929
Right there.
Go for base.

37:11.029 --> 37:12.998
VOLUNTEER 2:
Captain, we found a shoe,

37:13.098 --> 37:14.700
southwest of sector six.

37:14.800 --> 37:15.867
Size eight, could be the kid's.

37:15.967 --> 37:18.804
No, no. You're going
the wrong direction.

37:18.904 --> 37:20.639
You got to use the data.
HEATON: I don't care
about your data!

37:20.739 --> 37:21.640
We have minutes before
we lose the sun!

37:21.740 --> 37:22.808
CAVANAUGH:
But Captain...

37:22.908 --> 37:23.942
HEATON: We got one
more shot at this!

37:24.042 --> 37:25.911
We're doing it my way.

37:26.011 --> 37:27.679
Who's on my team?

37:27.779 --> 37:29.981
Got one, two, three. Let's go.
Yes, sir.

37:36.322 --> 37:38.424
Are you sure about this?

37:38.524 --> 37:40.292
Let's go.

37:40.392 --> 37:41.693
Okay.

37:41.793 --> 37:43.829
We're tracking you.

37:46.598 --> 37:48.367
TANNER: Antoine!
CAVANAUGH: Antoine!

37:48.467 --> 37:50.869
TANNER: Antoine!
(Cavanaugh sighs)

37:50.969 --> 37:52.804
Antoine!
Give me the tablet.

37:52.904 --> 37:55.741
Here you go.
(sighs) Let me
see this thing.

37:55.841 --> 37:58.644
All right.

37:58.744 --> 38:00.379
All right, just a
little further east.

38:00.479 --> 38:01.980
It's about a half a mile.

38:03.982 --> 38:05.384
Antoine!

38:05.484 --> 38:07.853
CAVANAUGH:
Antoine!

38:15.994 --> 38:19.898
CAVANAUGH: We're almost near
the target point.

38:19.998 --> 38:22.601
Antoine!
Wait, wait, wait.

38:22.701 --> 38:23.735
He's over here.

38:23.835 --> 38:24.936
He's right here.

38:25.036 --> 38:28.574
I think we found him.

38:28.674 --> 38:30.742
It's him,
we got him.

38:30.842 --> 38:31.743
You okay, buddy?
I got a pulse.

38:31.843 --> 38:32.811
He's alive.

38:33.679 --> 38:34.813
We need paramedics,
but he's alive.

38:34.913 --> 38:36.982
(all cheering, whooping)

38:37.082 --> 38:38.884
SARA:
Fantastic work, everyone.

38:38.984 --> 38:39.851
Good job.

38:43.088 --> 38:44.723
(lively chatter)

38:44.823 --> 38:45.891
We did it.

38:45.991 --> 38:48.059
You did it.

38:48.159 --> 38:51.363
(gags)

38:51.463 --> 38:53.832
(applause, cheering)

38:55.033 --> 38:56.968
CAMILLE:
Antoine?

38:57.068 --> 38:58.737
Antoine?

38:58.837 --> 39:01.640
(crying):
Baby. Oh, baby...

39:03.975 --> 39:07.078
It's-it's okay.
It's all right.

39:07.178 --> 39:08.880
It's all right.
You're gonna be fine.

39:08.980 --> 39:10.749
You're gonna be fine.

39:16.087 --> 39:17.889
I don't know how to thank you.

39:17.989 --> 39:20.125
You got a second chance.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.596
Go. Be with your son.

39:44.916 --> 39:46.885
*

40:08.840 --> 40:10.676
(taps key)

40:12.243 --> 40:14.145
ALEX: Everybody thinks
that it was my career

40:14.245 --> 40:17.115
in public service that must
have inspired my daughter Mia,

40:17.215 --> 40:19.150
but... they're wrong.

40:19.250 --> 40:21.787
Mia was the one
who inspired me.

40:21.887 --> 40:23.689
She pushed me.

40:23.789 --> 40:26.992
No, I know that you want to
sit here tonight and talk about

40:27.092 --> 40:30.896
my ex-husband and the reward,
and whether or not I think

40:30.996 --> 40:33.131
Carlos Ochoa
is guilty, right?

40:33.231 --> 40:35.200
Yeah. We're not gonna
talk about that.

40:35.300 --> 40:37.002
Alex, do you...
No, we're
not doing that.

40:37.102 --> 40:39.805
Okay?

40:39.905 --> 40:42.440
What I would like to talk
to you about is my daughter.

40:42.541 --> 40:45.977
And if and when
I'm ready to do that interview,

40:46.077 --> 40:48.013
I will make sure that
your paper is first in line.

40:48.113 --> 40:50.816
Okay?

40:50.916 --> 40:52.784
But tonight...

40:52.884 --> 40:54.753
I'd like to talk about
my daughter,

40:54.853 --> 40:57.956
and what I'm doing in her honor.

40:58.056 --> 41:00.191
Especially the affordable
housing proposals

41:00.291 --> 41:01.993
that we're working on.

41:02.093 --> 41:03.929
And you're gonna write about it.

41:06.632 --> 41:09.668
So, do we have a deal or...?

41:20.879 --> 41:23.014
(Cavanaugh sighs)

41:23.114 --> 41:25.150
(line ringing)

41:25.250 --> 41:27.218
TANNER:
Detective? You're up late.

41:27.318 --> 41:29.621
I checked all the arrests
from Berkeley that night.

41:29.721 --> 41:32.090
No guy matching the photo.

41:32.190 --> 41:34.225
Well, I thought
you couldn't do that for me.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.628
But...
(taps key)

41:36.728 --> 41:40.165
...city police had a sobriety
checkpoint a few blocks away.

41:40.265 --> 41:41.967
I'm sending you the file
right now.

41:42.067 --> 41:44.102
Same shirt as in the picture.

41:44.202 --> 41:45.771
Tattoos match, too.

41:45.871 --> 41:49.875
But current whereabouts unknown.

41:49.975 --> 41:52.744
Ryan Booth...

41:52.844 --> 41:55.681
I'll help you when I can,
how I can.

41:55.781 --> 41:58.249
That's the best I can do
for now.

41:58.349 --> 42:01.820
Thank you, Detective.

42:01.920 --> 42:04.723
Uh, can I...
can I put this on Sophe?

42:10.195 --> 42:12.230
Well, that's up to you.

42:32.684 --> 42:34.019

42:36.021 --> 42:37.623
