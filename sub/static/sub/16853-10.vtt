00:02.320 --> 00:04.959
This hospital is hemorrhaging
money because you spent

00:05.079 --> 00:08.532
$2 million to put a
helicopter on the roof.

00:08.600 --> 00:10.867
In all fairness, where was I gonna put it?

00:10.903 --> 00:11.769
In the basement?

00:12.505 --> 00:13.854
I'd say "Keep your day job,"

00:13.974 --> 00:15.606
but I'm firing you from it.

00:15.641 --> 00:16.707
No, please.

00:16.742 --> 00:18.342
Just give me another chance.

00:18.410 --> 00:21.178
A little more time, I can
turn this hospital around.

00:21.213 --> 00:23.546
One year.

00:23.582 --> 00:31.582
One more year, starting in... 10...9...8...
Better get going.

00:32.456 --> 00:40.456
- 7...6...5...
- 4...3...2...1... Happy new year!

00:42.298 --> 00:44.833
Lola, my new year's
resolution is to get you to go

00:44.902 --> 00:46.635
out with me, and you can't say no.

00:46.704 --> 00:47.369
No.

00:47.438 --> 00:50.373
- You can't...
- How's the new boyfriend, Cat?

00:50.442 --> 00:51.374
Who... Johnny?

00:51.443 --> 00:52.475
I had to dump him.

00:52.510 --> 00:54.444
He sold all my rollerblades for drugs.

00:54.480 --> 00:55.278
You know, weed?

00:55.314 --> 00:59.116
No, I do not know weed, but I do
know Dr. Joe's famous cake lollipops.

00:59.185 --> 01:00.585
I mean, these things are addictive!

01:00.955 --> 01:02.655
You know what else is addictive?

01:02.690 --> 01:03.556
What's that?

01:03.591 --> 01:04.290
Love.

01:04.358 --> 01:04.839
Love.

01:04.858 --> 01:06.292
Just ask Robert Palmer.

01:06.361 --> 01:07.328
Hey, don't laugh.

01:07.329 --> 01:08.009
I actually could.

01:08.044 --> 01:09.004
Bobby Palmer's a friend.

01:09.005 --> 01:09.925
Oops.

01:10.800 --> 01:12.901
That was a little intimate, Dori?

01:12.936 --> 01:14.402
No worries, Dr. Downs.

01:14.438 --> 01:16.404
I don't think I can get
pregnant from <i>that.</i>

01:17.908 --> 01:19.541
<i>Come on, Sy... think!</i>

01:19.576 --> 01:21.644
<i>You've got to save this hospital.</i>

01:21.679 --> 01:23.946
<i>I got to do a lot of
traveling last year... lots.</i>

01:23.981 --> 01:26.215
<i>Yeah, I'd love to do some
more traveling this year.</i>

01:26.284 --> 01:27.964
<i>If there's one thing I love, it's tourism.</i>

01:27.965 --> 01:30.854
<i>You want to make some
real money, stock trading is a</i>

01:30.890 --> 01:31.789

01:31.824 --> 01:35.359
<i>She said, "The only thing
faster than a taxi is a helicopter."</i>

01:35.394 --> 01:35.954
<i>Tourism.</i>

01:35.955 --> 01:36.694
<i>Moneymaker.</i>

01:36.729 --> 01:37.494
<i>Cahelicopter.</i>

01:37.530 --> 01:38.228

01:38.264 --> 01:38.944

01:39.699 --> 01:40.364

01:41.114 --> 01:41.798
<i>Helicopter.</i>

01:41.834 --> 01:44.474
<i>- Tourism... Is a moneymaker...
- With a helicopter.</i>

01:44.475 --> 01:45.702
<i>That's it!</i>

01:45.771 --> 01:48.972
<i>I'll rip all of my DVDs
on a new hard drive.</i>

01:49.007 --> 01:51.241
<i>That'll free up shelf space.</i>

01:51.276 --> 01:51.975
<i>Hey, Sy.</i>

01:52.010 --> 01:54.911
<i>You ever think about making the
hospital extra money by using</i>

01:54.946 --> 01:56.979
<i>the helicopter for tourists and commuters?</i>

01:57.048 --> 01:58.447
<i>That'll work, too!</i>

01:58.516 --> 01:59.815
<i>Hey!</i>

01:59.884 --> 02:02.418
<i>Happy Valentine's day, Lola.</i>

02:11.397 --> 02:12.563
<i>- ho, Dr. Joe.</i>

02:12.598 --> 02:14.832
<i>You make this saving-life
crap worthwhile.</i>

02:14.868 --> 02:16.367
<i>This guy's a master baker!</i>

02:16.403 --> 02:17.001
<i>Excuse me.</i>

02:17.070 --> 02:17.735
<i>Excuse me.</i>

02:17.804 --> 02:20.371
<i>Is this where I get the
helicopter to downtown?</i>

02:20.440 --> 02:22.340
<i>- - Sir?</i>

02:22.375 --> 02:23.641
<i>Yes, it is. Yes, it is.</i>

02:23.677 --> 02:25.343

What should I do?

02:35.102 --> 02:37.488
I say, move on dot org.

02:37.557 --> 02:39.657
Well, Dori, that was a little intimate.

02:39.726 --> 02:40.992
No worries, Dr. Downs.

02:41.027 --> 02:42.927
I don't think I'll get pregnant from <i>that.</i>

02:45.065 --> 02:46.397

02:46.433 --> 02:47.732

<i>We're really in love.</i>

03:11.660 --> 03:12.859
<i>I just gave the kid in room 3</i>

03:16.432 --> 03:17.331
<i>No problem.</i>

<i>And also, Dr. Downs, I don't

<i>happened in the closet three weeks ago.</i>

03:21.671 --> 03:23.670
<i>Let me guess... you're pregnant?</i>

03:23.739 --> 03:24.838
<i>Yeah. I'm sorry.</i>

03:24.874 --> 03:25.939
<i>That's fine.</i>

03:25.975 --> 03:26.607
<i>It's fine.</i>

03:26.676 --> 03:29.577
<i>It's just, you know, that I make
a lot of money and I play a lot</i>

03:29.612 --> 03:32.580
<i>of golf and I own a lot of
cufflinks, and you're, you know...</i>

03:32.615 --> 03:33.581
<i>I mean, you get it.</i>

03:33.616 --> 03:34.656
<i>I get it... totally.</i>

03:34.691 --> 03:37.211
<i>But I will</i> pay for the child
support and the education.

03:37.212 --> 03:37.652
Okay.

03:37.654 --> 03:38.586
What do you say?

03:38.655 --> 03:39.095
Cool.

03:39.122 --> 03:39.954
Okay? Great.

03:40.023 --> 03:41.823
Just remember to check
on the kid in room 3.

03:41.824 --> 03:42.423
Okay.

03:42.492 --> 03:44.525
Thanks.

03:47.095 --> 03:48.062
Welcome back, folks.

03:48.131 --> 03:49.664
How was your tour of downtown?

03:49.699 --> 03:50.965
Perfect mother's day gift.

03:52.669 --> 03:55.403
Lot of baggage, which is
something I would never bring to

03:55.439 --> 03:56.438
a sexual relationship.

03:56.506 --> 03:57.806
Owen, still no.

03:57.841 --> 03:59.441
Hey, everyone!

03:59.476 --> 04:02.711
I whipped up some special red,
white, and blue lollicakes.

04:02.746 --> 04:03.979
So good!

04:04.014 --> 04:06.781
But why red, white, and
blue for mother's day?

04:07.817 --> 04:10.418
Happy 4th of July, everyone!

04:10.454 --> 04:12.087
I had these left over from mother's day.

04:13.123 --> 04:14.422
Now, that makes more sense.

04:14.458 --> 04:15.458
4th of July.

04:15.459 --> 04:16.692
Even stale, they're delicious!

04:17.461 --> 04:18.427
These are my favorite.

04:18.462 --> 04:19.894
- Lola...
- The answer is no.

04:19.930 --> 04:20.896
Hi, Cat.

04:20.964 --> 04:21.730
Hey.

04:21.798 --> 04:23.699
How's your stockbroker boyfriend?

04:23.734 --> 04:25.635
Turns out he wasn't a stockbroker.

04:25.670 --> 04:26.710
He was a full-time rapist.

04:26.738 --> 04:27.704
Ouch!

04:27.739 --> 04:28.638
I know.

04:28.707 --> 04:30.006
Thanks so much for asking.

04:30.042 --> 04:33.076
Sometimes I think of you as,
like, a father, but, of course,

04:33.145 --> 04:34.812
not in prison, like my real dad.

04:34.847 --> 04:36.447
I'm touched.

04:36.516 --> 04:37.715
I've run many prisons.

04:38.585 --> 04:42.453
And I should <i>in one, but
I'm not in one at the moment.</i>

04:50.756 --> 04:52.196
<i>My son's been throwing up all night.</i>

04:52.232 --> 04:53.931
<i>Okay, fill out these forms, please.</i>

04:53.966 --> 04:55.459
<i>We're on a 3:30 flight to Phoenix.</i>

04:55.460 --> 04:57.820
<i>- Okay, boarding pass, I.D...
- Dori, file these,</i>

04:57.821 --> 04:58.101
<i>please.</i>

04:58.170 --> 04:59.850
<i>And tell me when the baby comes out, okay?</i>

04:59.851 --> 05:01.371
<i>So I can give you a check or whatever.</i>

05:01.372 --> 05:02.172
<i>Okay, will do.</i>

05:02.220 --> 05:03.100
<i>Okay, you are all set.</i>

<i>Can I help you?</i>

05:14.853 --> 05:17.654

05:17.690 --> 05:21.124
My name is Elliot Leizman, and I'm
with the Simon Wiesenthal Center.

05:21.193 --> 05:24.560
My job's to track down Nazi war
criminals who are believed to be

05:24.596 --> 05:25.828
in hiding here in Brazil.

05:25.864 --> 05:29.465
Which, of course, as we both
know, is where we are... Brazil.

05:29.500 --> 05:33.102
Number 1 on our list is Dr. Josef
Mengele, the notorious

05:33.137 --> 05:37.840
madman who performed unspeakable
experiments during the war.

05:37.908 --> 05:41.744
He was presumed dead in '79, but
till I see a body, I'll search

05:41.779 --> 05:46.683
every doctor's office, hospital, and
medical lab this side of the Panama canal.

05:46.718 --> 05:50.020

help me, but I'm asking you,

05:50.055 --> 05:53.023

08:10.701 --> 08:13.035
<i>You guys want to hit banana
Joe's, or do you just</i>

08:13.071 --> 08:16.038
<i>want to get dressed up in my
room at the Marriott and go from</i>

08:16.074 --> 08:16.405
<i>there?</i>

08:16.441 --> 08:17.306
<i>Not tonight.</i>

08:17.341 --> 08:20.009
<i>You know, my husband and I are
opening up a special bottle of</i>

08:20.044 --> 08:22.211
<i>Shiraz, and then I'm gonna
let him put it up my butt.</i>

08:22.280 --> 08:24.515
<i>And my guy's making his
famous Halloween dinner, and</i>

08:24.516 --> 08:27.116
<i>then we're gonna take a romantic
bubble bath, then I'm gonna let</i>

08:27.152 --> 08:28.051
<i>him put it up my</i> butt.

08:28.119 --> 08:29.852
Well, what about you, Danielle?

08:29.888 --> 08:32.248
Wish I could, but Halloween's
about spending time with the

08:32.256 --> 08:34.736
people who are the constants in
your life... the ones who ask

08:34.738 --> 08:37.378
you the same thing over and over
again, you say "No," and now you

08:37.379 --> 08:38.126
feel bad about it.

08:38.163 --> 08:39.128
But happy Halloween.

08:39.197 --> 08:40.129
Happy Halloween.

08:40.965 --> 08:43.866
<i>My new year's resolution is
to get you to go out with me...</i>

08:43.900 --> 08:46.141
<i>Imagine these cups are our...
Why don't you just let me</i>

08:46.170 --> 08:48.671
<i>fertilize your... put it up my butt.</i>

08:55.713 --> 08:56.947
<i>Attention, staff.</i>

08:56.982 --> 08:58.048
<i>Happy Thanksgiving.</i>

08:58.083 --> 09:00.317
<i>The current threat level is burnt sienna.</i>

09:00.352 --> 09:01.685
<i>Dori, what are we at?</i>

09:01.754 --> 09:02.953
<i>8 months. Almost there.</i>

09:02.988 --> 09:03.887
<i>Okay, good.</i>

09:03.923 --> 09:05.523
<i>The cash is ready to go, so don't worry.</i>

09:05.524 --> 09:06.190
<i>Great.</i>

09:06.259 --> 09:08.692
<i>Owen! Owen! Owen!</i>

09:10.495 --> 09:11.328
<i>Owen!</i>

09:11.363 --> 09:12.228
<i>Lola?</i>

09:12.264 --> 09:14.397
<i>I've been running for three weeks.</i>

09:14.433 --> 09:17.701
<i>I almost gave up, but I had to
come back because I realized,</i>

09:17.769 --> 09:22.706
<i>Owen, that I not</i> want to
go out with you... ever.

09:22.741 --> 09:25.709
So... what do you say?

09:25.744 --> 09:26.810
What do you mean?

09:26.879 --> 09:27.479
What <i>can</i> I say?

09:27.480 --> 09:29.179
I have no choice but to say "Okay."

09:30.116 --> 09:31.715
"Okay."

09:31.784 --> 09:33.083
I like "okay."

09:33.118 --> 09:35.819
You son of a gun, you did it!

09:35.855 --> 09:37.087
We're in the black!

09:37.122 --> 09:38.355
Happy days are here!

09:38.424 --> 09:39.823
Goodbye, gray skies!

09:39.858 --> 09:41.791
Hello, blue!

09:44.195 --> 09:45.361
Nobody move!

09:45.430 --> 09:46.896
I got the place surrounded!

09:46.965 --> 09:47.998
Where's Dr. Mengele?!

09:49.902 --> 09:51.168
Roof!

09:51.203 --> 09:52.369
Move! Move! Move!

09:52.438 --> 09:55.006
Go! Let's go! Let's go!

09:59.244 --> 10:01.345
<i>Goodbye, Childrens Hospital.</i>

10:01.380 --> 10:02.813
<i>Thanks for the memories.</i>

10:02.848 --> 10:03.981
<i>Goodbye, Cat.</i>

10:04.016 --> 10:05.883
<i>Goodbye, daddy!</i>

10:05.918 --> 10:07.985
<i>I'll miss having sex with you!</i>

10:08.021 --> 10:09.253
<i>That's not my real</i> daddy.

10:09.289 --> 10:11.455
I would never have sex with my real daddy.

10:11.491 --> 10:12.990
That's just Josef Mengele.

10:13.025 --> 10:21.025
♪ That warm Christmas feeling
is everywhere I go ♪

10:23.302 --> 10:31.302
♪ That warm Christmas feeling
that melts the falling snow ♪

10:32.177 --> 10:40.177
9...8...7...6...
5...4...3...2...1.

10:41.020 --> 10:42.186
Time's up.

10:42.221 --> 10:43.220
You're fired.

10:43.255 --> 10:44.555
I know.

10:48.960 --> 10:52.930
But I do have one more idea...
girls in scanty-clad clothes,

10:52.998 --> 10:57.100
you know, and very tight and...
and then they da... ""

10:57.870 --> 10:59.503
It will bring a lot of people in.

10:59.538 --> 11:02.139
We'll call it "Childrens Hospital Revue"!

11:02.175 --> 11:03.841
You're re-hired.

11:07.379 --> 11:09.013
<i>Attention, staff.</i>

11:09.048 --> 11:11.582
<i>Have you tried Dr.
Adolf's brownie bites?</i>
