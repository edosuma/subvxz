(grunting)

00:19.509 --> 00:21.010
LINDA: <i>Tina, good. Louise, eh.</i>

00:21.044 --> 00:22.478
Gene, get the back a little.

00:22.479 --> 00:24.713
Back, back, up, down,
side, side, go, go!

00:24.714 --> 00:26.649
And... time.
Brushes down!

00:26.650 --> 00:28.350
Yuck! What was that stuff?!

00:28.351 --> 00:29.718
Toothpaste.

00:29.719 --> 00:31.320
So <i> that's</i> toothpaste!

00:31.354 --> 00:33.188
All right, now hurry up and floss

00:33.189 --> 00:35.491
like you've been flossing every
day for the past six months. Go.

00:35.525 --> 00:37.026
We don't <i> have</i> any floss.

00:37.027 --> 00:38.727
We all agreed not to get
food between our teeth.

00:38.728 --> 00:40.195
Maybe Dr. Yap won't notice.

00:40.230 --> 00:41.530
Oh, he'll notice.

00:41.531 --> 00:43.198
Dr. Yap notices everything.

00:43.199 --> 00:44.833
He's like an eagle
soaring through your mouth.

00:44.868 --> 00:47.169
You know, I think I'm gonna
sit this one out today.

00:47.203 --> 00:49.104
Not so fast, Miss Missy.

00:49.105 --> 00:51.040
Those teeth are gonna
get cleaned twice a year

00:51.041 --> 00:53.075
until Dr. Yap stops
taking our insurance.

00:53.109 --> 00:54.843
Why do we even have
to get our teeth cleaned?

00:54.844 --> 00:56.645
What kind of a racket is that?

00:56.680 --> 00:58.681
Louise, we know
you hate going to the dentist,

00:58.682 --> 01:01.216
but come on, can we have
this go smoothly just one time?

01:01.251 --> 01:03.452
Sure, sure.
Let me go get my coat.

01:03.453 --> 01:04.887
She's gonna lock

01:04.921 --> 01:06.422
herself in her room!

01:06.423 --> 01:07.723
Don't make me tackle you!
(thud, groan)

01:07.724 --> 01:09.058
BOB: Got her foot.
Damn it!

01:10.126 --> 01:11.894
Spotless, as always, Tina.

01:11.895 --> 01:13.699
You know, we don't always have
to make this about business.

01:13.730 --> 01:15.698
I'm more than just
a mouthful of perfect teeth.

01:15.732 --> 01:17.132
And off you go.

01:17.133 --> 01:20.035
(creaking) All right, all set.

01:20.036 --> 01:21.971
I feel violated.
Maybe a toy would help?

01:21.972 --> 01:23.706
Okay. You like that toy basket?

01:23.707 --> 01:26.108
Mm-hmm. Toy basket
is what it's all about!

01:26.109 --> 01:28.577
Come on, cup n' ball,
or pirate tattoo!

01:28.578 --> 01:30.746
Ooh!
Ah, the old get-all-the-BBs

01:30.780 --> 01:33.015
into-all-the-holes game. A classic.
I'll master this

01:33.049 --> 01:34.450
when I should be brushing my teeth.

01:34.451 --> 01:35.918
Gene, that's not really the idea.

01:35.919 --> 01:37.764
Bup, bup, bup. Bup.
Got the toy, gonna go.

01:37.787 --> 01:39.555
Well, well, well.
They haven't ripped up

01:39.556 --> 01:42.258
your dental license yet, huh, Dr. Yap?

01:42.259 --> 01:44.627
What's it made out of?
Is it hard to rip?

01:44.661 --> 01:46.061
Ah, hello, Louise.

01:46.062 --> 01:47.563
Still afraid of the dentist?

01:47.597 --> 01:49.298
Afraid?! I'm not afraid!

01:49.299 --> 01:51.800
You're afraid!
You reek of fear!

01:51.835 --> 01:53.569
Whatever you say.
(coughs): Scaredy-cat!

01:53.570 --> 01:55.304
Look, how about I
just sit in that chair

01:55.305 --> 01:56.839
for the allotted time,
flip through a nature mag,

01:56.840 --> 01:58.574
and you can still get your easy money?

01:58.575 --> 02:00.409
Nope.
Ugh! Fine.

02:00.410 --> 02:02.745
But you're in and out in two
minutes, or I start biting.

02:02.746 --> 02:05.481
No loitering! Scrape a gum,
I slap your face, got it?

02:05.482 --> 02:07.416
I know the rules, Louise.
You're the boss.

02:07.417 --> 02:10.085
Just in case you forgot.
All right.

02:10.120 --> 02:13.122
We need you to open your mouth.

02:13.156 --> 02:14.857
Okay, now just, uh...
You're doing great.

02:14.858 --> 02:16.792
Just, the opposite of what
I've asked you to do.

02:16.793 --> 02:18.360
Just open it.
Are we done?

02:18.361 --> 02:20.529
Almost. Just...
Aah. There you go.

02:20.530 --> 02:22.398
<i>Aah.</i> Great, great.

02:22.432 --> 02:23.999
Perfect, tiny opening
I can see through.

02:24.034 --> 02:25.634
(breathing loudly) Hmm.

02:25.635 --> 02:26.902
Ow!

02:26.937 --> 02:28.671
That was fair.
That was fair.

02:28.672 --> 02:30.339
That was my bad. I didn't...
You need to talk to me!

02:30.340 --> 02:31.874
You're right. I know.
It was my fault. I just...

02:31.875 --> 02:33.609
You got real quiet!
No, I know.

02:33.610 --> 02:35.477
Bob, we have a situation.
Did Louise hit you?

02:35.478 --> 02:37.513
Yes, but that's not the problem.

02:37.514 --> 02:41.283
She's got a cavity. Wow.
So, oh, Louise got her first cavity.

02:41.318 --> 02:44.119
(laughing): Yeah, and it's a doozy.
Oh, it's so bad.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.788
Look, I have a cancellation.

02:45.789 --> 02:47.957
I can do the filling right now.
Boom, bam. (clicks tongue)

02:47.991 --> 02:49.692
Hmm. Yeah, maybe a
surprise attack is best.

02:49.693 --> 02:51.060
This isn't gonna be easy.

02:51.061 --> 02:52.628
(sighs)

02:52.629 --> 02:54.063
(whispering):
I don't want to go back in there.

02:54.064 --> 02:55.631
I really don't want
to go back in there, Bob.

02:55.632 --> 02:56.999
Listen.
Mm-hmm?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.367
You can do this.
Yup. Yup.

02:58.401 --> 02:59.835
All right?
Okay.

02:59.836 --> 03:01.303
So, I'll see you later? Yup. Yup.

03:01.304 --> 03:02.738
All right.
(exhales loudly)

03:02.739 --> 03:05.007
I need to stretch out
a little bit. Yup.

03:05.008 --> 03:06.742
You know, I'm just
gonna do a little...

03:06.743 --> 03:08.577
(sighs)... trivial touchup on
that second molar.

03:08.578 --> 03:10.857
What the hell's all that for? Um...

03:10.880 --> 03:12.147
You have a...

03:12.148 --> 03:13.449
(quietly): Cavity.

03:13.483 --> 03:14.883
A cavity?!

03:14.884 --> 03:16.218
No, no, I'm not getting a filling!

03:16.219 --> 03:18.654
Hey, fill this!
Hey! Hey!

03:18.655 --> 03:20.222
You back off!
(shrieks)

03:20.257 --> 03:22.157
(shrieks)

03:22.192 --> 03:23.759
DR. YAP (shrieking):
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Sorry!

03:23.760 --> 03:25.194
It's fun in there.
It's fun.

03:25.228 --> 03:26.662
Here's what's gonna happen, okay?

03:26.663 --> 03:28.330
I'm going out this window,

03:28.331 --> 03:30.332
and that's the last
you'll ever see of these teeth.

03:30.333 --> 03:31.734
Your parents will
bring you back, Louise.

03:31.735 --> 03:33.102
You have a cavity.

03:33.103 --> 03:34.536
Let 'em. I'll keep running!

03:34.537 --> 03:36.038
Ho-ho, they'll never find me.

03:36.039 --> 03:37.907
You're gonna wait ten...
Hey! (shrieks)

03:37.908 --> 03:39.508
You're gonna wait ten minutes
till you tell my dad I'm gone.

03:39.509 --> 03:41.243
This is sil... I...
What did I just say?!

03:41.244 --> 03:42.945
Okay! All right!
Ten minutes. I'm sorry.

03:42.946 --> 03:45.848
Adios, Yap!

03:45.849 --> 03:47.883
She's gone! She ran away! What?!

03:47.884 --> 03:49.885
She told me to wait ten minutes
before I told you.

03:49.920 --> 03:52.388
But I'm a grown man, and she's a
little girl, so I waited eight!

03:52.389 --> 03:55.090
You waited eight minutes to
tell me my daughter ran away?!

03:55.091 --> 03:56.759
Don't tell Louise
I didn't wait the full ten.

03:56.760 --> 03:58.861
Maybe she ran away into the car.

03:58.862 --> 04:00.262
Oh, no, she's gone. Oh, my God.

04:00.263 --> 04:01.697
(shouting): Louise!

04:01.698 --> 04:03.065
Dad, you're scaring everyone.

04:03.066 --> 04:04.533
Oh, sorry.
Yeah.

04:04.534 --> 04:06.992
(shouting): Louise! (birds screeching)

04:08.476 --> 04:11.277
Aah. Aah. Oh, I can't believe
my baby ran away!

04:11.278 --> 04:12.679
We haven't found her yet,
but we're going to.

04:12.680 --> 04:14.114
Aah. I don't know.

04:14.115 --> 04:15.649
She is pretty small
when she crouches down.

04:15.650 --> 04:17.083
She could be anywhere by now,

04:17.084 --> 04:19.084
and in need
of semi-urgent dental care!

04:19.086 --> 04:20.654
She could have fallen into a crevasse!

04:20.654 --> 04:22.622
Do we have those, Bobby?
How deep are they? Oh, God.

04:22.623 --> 04:24.024
She has to come home.

04:24.025 --> 04:25.492
I mean, she's nine years old.

04:25.493 --> 04:27.327
It's not like
she's thought this through.

04:27.361 --> 04:29.796
(crow cawing)

04:31.265 --> 04:33.667
(birds singing)

04:39.507 --> 04:42.108
Exactly where I left it.

04:42.109 --> 04:43.943
Oh. Right.

04:43.944 --> 04:45.378
(laughs)

04:45.379 --> 04:46.813
Candy cell phone.

04:46.814 --> 04:48.448
I was only seven
when I packed this go bag.

04:48.449 --> 04:50.817
I guess I was just a kid back then.

04:50.851 --> 04:52.585
(phone ringing)

04:52.620 --> 04:55.322
Hello? Louise, is that you?
Are you dead?!

04:55.323 --> 04:57.824
Oh, I'm alive and well, and
I plan to stay that way.

04:57.825 --> 04:59.326
And don't bother tracing this call,

04:59.327 --> 05:00.794
'cause I'm not gonna
be on long enough.

05:00.795 --> 05:02.295
Louise, honey, come home!

05:02.296 --> 05:04.864
Only if you call off
that lunatic, Dr. Yap!

05:04.865 --> 05:06.333
Louise, it's your father.

05:06.334 --> 05:07.967
Just come home and get
the stupid filling.

05:07.968 --> 05:09.636
Sorry, Dad, that's not gonna happen.

05:09.637 --> 05:12.005
So, uh, oh, geez,
I guess this is good-bye.

05:12.006 --> 05:13.396
Not how I imagined it.

05:13.407 --> 05:14.841
What? Good-bye?

05:14.842 --> 05:16.643
What do you mean?
We're your family!

05:16.644 --> 05:18.645
Well, Mom, sometimes these
things just don't work out.

05:18.646 --> 05:20.347
Louise, don't...
No, Louise, don't go...

05:21.382 --> 05:23.516
So, Ms. Black, you want to reserve

05:23.517 --> 05:26.186
the Duchess Suite for an
indefinite stay, and you have

05:26.187 --> 05:28.388
one Mr. Bob Belcher's credit card.

05:28.389 --> 05:30.991
Now all I need to complete
this check-in is an adult.

05:30.992 --> 05:32.759
Yeah. I believe this photo I.D.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.728
says I'm an adult.
Yes.

05:34.729 --> 05:36.162
Yeah.
It says you're 43.

05:36.163 --> 05:37.664
Mm-hmm. But it's written in pencil.

05:37.665 --> 05:39.065
And the background says

05:39.066 --> 05:40.333
"Wagstaff School Picture Day."

05:40.334 --> 05:42.335
Wagstaff was my platoon in 'Nam.

05:42.336 --> 05:44.070
Oh, man, they said

05:44.071 --> 05:46.039
there'd be people
like you when I came back.

05:46.040 --> 05:48.074
Uh-huh. Serving my country,
protecting your ass.

05:48.075 --> 05:50.276
I'm going to have to call
the police now. What?

05:50.277 --> 05:52.679
So they can give you a ride home.
Good-bye.

05:57.551 --> 05:59.219
(doorbell rings)

05:59.220 --> 06:02.055
(multiple locks clicking open)

06:02.056 --> 06:03.690
(door creaks shut, lock clicks open)

06:03.691 --> 06:06.259
Louise, what a surprise!

06:06.260 --> 06:08.461
I'm so glad it's you
and not a murderer.

06:08.462 --> 06:11.197
Nope. Just me, as planned.
Remember?

06:11.198 --> 06:12.966
No.

06:12.967 --> 06:15.535
Aunt Gayle, I wrote you weeks
ago about staying with you.

06:15.536 --> 06:19.039
Oh, that darn mailman
must be taking my letters!

06:19.040 --> 06:21.608
If that's his way
of getting me to notice him,

06:21.609 --> 06:23.076
it's kind of working.

06:23.077 --> 06:24.477
You remember the cats? (meowing)

06:24.478 --> 06:26.746
Do I? There's this one and that one.

06:26.747 --> 06:28.248
Oh, the-the other one!

06:28.249 --> 06:29.916
Oh, they like you.

06:29.917 --> 06:31.551
The farther they walk away from you,

06:31.585 --> 06:33.053
the more they like you.

06:33.054 --> 06:34.421
What's, uh...
what's going on

06:34.422 --> 06:35.922
with the plastic situation over here?

06:35.923 --> 06:37.891
Are you renovating your bed?

06:37.892 --> 06:39.492
Ah, I'm not such a good sleeper

06:39.493 --> 06:40.927
so I kind of invented this little game

06:40.928 --> 06:42.429
where I'm the last living

06:42.430 --> 06:43.897
person in the world.

06:43.898 --> 06:45.332
Oh. Does that help, or...?

06:45.333 --> 06:46.733
Yeah! This keeps out the radiation

06:46.734 --> 06:48.401
and the mutant carnivores

06:48.402 --> 06:51.404
that prowl the earth at night,
and I sleep like a baby.

06:51.405 --> 06:53.440
Okay. Well, that's great.

06:53.441 --> 06:55.108
I'm gonna go hit the can.

06:55.109 --> 06:56.509
Well, I'll just call your mom

06:56.510 --> 06:58.011
and let her know you got here safely.

06:58.012 --> 07:00.113
No, no, no, no, do <i> not</i> do that.

07:00.114 --> 07:03.283
My mom said for you to only call
her if I <i> don't</i> get here safely.

07:03.284 --> 07:05.452
Makes sense.
Mm-hmm.

07:06.988 --> 07:10.256
In case I have to keep running,
Cuba's that way.

07:10.257 --> 07:12.425
I can just take a...
Ow! Ow! Ow!

07:12.426 --> 07:13.994
(sucks in through teeth) Suck it up!

07:13.995 --> 07:16.496
(phone ringing) Hello?

07:16.530 --> 07:17.529
Gayle, it's Linda.

07:17.531 --> 07:20.166
Hey, Lin, it's me, Gayle.

07:20.167 --> 07:22.168
Yeah, I-I know, hon.
I called you.

07:22.169 --> 07:23.269
Oh. Okay.

07:23.270 --> 07:24.938
Listen, have you seen Louise?

07:24.939 --> 07:26.373
Yeah, she's here at my place.

07:26.374 --> 07:28.808
Oh, thank God.
Bob, she's at Gayle's.

07:28.809 --> 07:31.277
Yeah, it's that scheduled visit
I didn't know about.

07:31.278 --> 07:32.512
She ran away, Gayle.

07:32.513 --> 07:34.014
(gasps)

07:34.015 --> 07:35.548
Oh, my.
Where'd she go?!

07:35.549 --> 07:37.684
She's at your house, hon.
Oh, right, right.

07:37.685 --> 07:39.319
She's afraid of the dentist.
She got a cavity,

07:39.320 --> 07:40.787
and she doesn't want to get a filling.

07:40.788 --> 07:41.988
Well, who does?

07:41.989 --> 07:43.490
Okay, well, uh,
we'll come pick her up,

07:43.491 --> 07:45.291
but don't tell her, or she'll run.

07:45.292 --> 07:46.826
Oh, good thinking, Lin.

07:46.827 --> 07:48.662
You're the smart one, I'm the hot one.

07:48.696 --> 07:50.697
No. That little dental dodger.

07:50.698 --> 07:52.399
How come Louise gets to run away?

07:52.400 --> 07:54.000
She doesn't <i> get</i> to run away.

07:54.001 --> 07:55.869
I want to run away!

07:55.870 --> 07:57.537
Yeah, I could stand to run away.

07:57.538 --> 07:59.239
It could be chapter four of my memoir,

07:59.240 --> 08:01.474
right after chapter three:
"Going to the Dentist."

08:01.475 --> 08:03.043
No one else is running away.

08:03.044 --> 08:04.844
We just need Louise
to get that filling.

08:04.845 --> 08:06.513
Good luck with that.

08:06.514 --> 08:08.548
Maybe it's time for a
little creative parenting.

08:08.549 --> 08:10.717
Wait. What do we do, Lin...
bribe her to get the filling?

08:10.718 --> 08:12.852
Bribe Louise? We don't
have that kind of money.

08:12.853 --> 08:14.554
But if she lost a bet...

08:14.555 --> 08:15.855
I don't know.
What's the bet?

08:15.856 --> 08:17.090
Pack your bags, kids.

08:17.091 --> 08:18.325
You're running away, too!

08:18.326 --> 08:19.492
Yay!
Yay!

08:19.493 --> 08:21.761
(doorbell rings, cat purrs)

08:23.497 --> 08:24.831
What the...?
What are you guys...?

08:24.832 --> 08:26.232
Guess who else is running away.

08:26.233 --> 08:27.734
Us. Gene and myself.

08:27.768 --> 08:30.103
What about Mom and Dad?
They dropped us off.

08:30.938 --> 08:32.339
I'm not coming home!

08:32.340 --> 08:34.107
I know. Stay at your Aunt Gayle's!

08:34.107 --> 08:35.842
Great. I will. Forever. Thanks.

08:35.842 --> 08:37.910
(laughs) I bet you
can't last the weekend

08:37.912 --> 08:39.279
without Gayle driving you nuts!

08:39.280 --> 08:41.114
Bet I can.
I love it here!

08:41.115 --> 08:43.216
Yeah, care to make a wager? Sure!

08:43.217 --> 08:45.185
I'll tell you what. If you
last the whole weekend,

08:45.186 --> 08:46.686
you don't have to get the filling.

08:46.687 --> 08:48.955
But if you crack,
if you can't hack it,

08:48.956 --> 08:51.625
you get the drillin'
and the fillin'. Deal?

08:51.626 --> 08:53.059
Of course it's a deal!

08:53.060 --> 08:55.095
I can stay here till I'm 30!

08:55.096 --> 08:58.565
It's the most fun
studio apartment in the world!

08:58.566 --> 09:00.133
This better work.

09:00.134 --> 09:01.468
It's gonna work
'cause we're gonna cheat.

09:01.469 --> 09:02.736
We got a man on the inside.

09:02.737 --> 09:04.070
(phone buzzing) "Hi, Mom.

09:04.071 --> 09:05.538
Ready when you are.
It's Tina."

09:05.539 --> 09:07.259
(phone buzzing)
"Tina, your daughter, Tina."

09:09.597 --> 09:11.765
Okay. It's time to text Tina
her first instructions.

09:11.766 --> 09:13.867
We're gonna raise Gayle's
crazy meter to un-fun levels.

09:13.902 --> 09:16.203
Super secret-style, like a ninja.

09:16.204 --> 09:18.372
You know, this whole situation
is absurd.

09:18.406 --> 09:20.274
Hey, you got to fight crazy
with crazy.

09:20.275 --> 09:22.442
Well, Louise gets this
from your side of the family.

09:22.443 --> 09:24.044
(laughing):
You don't think I know that?

09:24.045 --> 09:26.179
(cackling)

09:26.180 --> 09:27.881
What are you doing?
Stop that.

09:27.916 --> 09:30.183
(cackling)

09:30.218 --> 09:31.618
(phone buzzes) (grunting)

09:31.619 --> 09:33.287
Go in the hole, BBs!

09:33.288 --> 09:35.189
Aah! I was so close!

09:35.190 --> 09:37.157
What do you have against
novelty amusements, cat?!

09:37.191 --> 09:39.459
(humming) Hi, Aunt Gayle.

09:39.460 --> 09:42.095
So, um, we were wondering
if you'd read us your poetry.

09:42.096 --> 09:43.530
Uh, what?
Really?

09:43.531 --> 09:44.898
What? You kids want to hear my poetry?

09:44.899 --> 09:46.700
Tina! Oh, wonderful, wonderful!

09:46.701 --> 09:48.402
What's happening?

09:48.403 --> 09:50.537
(clearing her throat)

09:50.538 --> 09:53.340
"Happy Things
We Should Send Into Space."

09:53.374 --> 09:55.309
A jar of mayo.

09:55.310 --> 09:57.844
Magazine clippings of Scott Baio.

09:57.879 --> 09:59.613
That song that starts with "Day-O"...

09:59.614 --> 10:01.949
Little cat, you're just like me.

10:01.983 --> 10:04.484
You go outside and squat to pee.

10:04.485 --> 10:07.054
(shouting): Squat! Squat!

10:07.055 --> 10:08.889
Squat! Squat!
(clapping)

10:08.923 --> 10:10.891
Yeah! (whoops) Okay. That's...

10:10.892 --> 10:12.426
Oh, ah... we got to stop.

10:12.460 --> 10:13.760
But I'm not done.
(shouting): Squat!

10:13.761 --> 10:15.362
The end.

10:15.396 --> 10:17.264
Great poems, Aunt Gayle.
Okay, I'll take that.

10:17.298 --> 10:19.666
Thank you. Wait.
But I have so many more!

10:19.667 --> 10:21.101
And I want to read them!

10:21.102 --> 10:23.470
Later. Alone. So I
don't disturb anyone

10:23.471 --> 10:28.008
when I go, "Mmm. Uh-huh.
Well put. Devastating."

10:28.009 --> 10:30.277
(phone buzzing) LINDA: Oh, poopsicles!

10:30.311 --> 10:33.113
Louise outflanked us. I think
we got to turn up the heat.

10:33.147 --> 10:34.748
You know, I haven't read
any parenting books,

10:34.749 --> 10:37.284
but I'm pretty sure
this wouldn't be in there.

10:37.285 --> 10:39.653
Parenting books?
There are parenting books? Um...

10:39.654 --> 10:41.288
I thought they were...
that was a joke.

10:41.289 --> 10:43.290
Well, there are parenting books. Huh.

10:43.291 --> 10:45.125
I should write a book.

10:45.126 --> 10:46.927
I'd call it <i>Hey, You,
I Saw That. Put It Back!</i>

10:46.928 --> 10:48.595
That's... Yeah. Yup,
you should do that.

10:48.596 --> 10:50.964
I know, right? Make a fortune. Mm-hmm.

10:50.999 --> 10:54.835
Hey, Aunt Gayle, do your cats'
claw caps come in other colors?

10:54.836 --> 10:56.470
What, their Pretty Paws?
(purring and mewing)

10:56.471 --> 10:58.071
Of course!
I got lots of colors.

10:58.106 --> 10:59.773
It's just maybe Jean Paw'd Van Damme

10:59.774 --> 11:01.275
would be happier in pastel colors.

11:01.276 --> 11:02.609
It is spring, after all.

11:02.644 --> 11:04.745
(gasps) You're so right.

11:04.779 --> 11:07.381
Oh, Pink Eye and Mr. Business,

11:07.382 --> 11:09.616
you must be so embarrassed
that you're still

11:09.651 --> 11:11.045
in winter colors.

11:11.052 --> 11:12.819
Let's change 'em up!
We'll all help.

11:12.820 --> 11:15.989
Yeah! If we all pitch in,
it'll only take a few hours.

11:15.990 --> 11:17.658
I'm sure you guys got it covered.

11:17.659 --> 11:19.293
I'm just gonna go... Cat nail salon!

11:19.327 --> 11:21.662
Louise, you hold Mr. Business.
Hurry, hurry.

11:21.663 --> 11:24.231
Why do I have to have Mr.
Business? He's the worst one.

11:24.232 --> 11:27.034
Gene, you-you switch with me. Hell no.

11:27.068 --> 11:29.069
Oh, yeah. Oh, wrap 'em up
with these towels,

11:29.070 --> 11:30.838
'cause when we take
the old Pretty Paws off,

11:30.839 --> 11:32.840
they tend to go for the eyes.
Ah!

11:32.841 --> 11:35.909
No, just round 'em up. Just
close your eyes and dive on 'em.

11:35.910 --> 11:37.678
Thanks so much for helping, kids.

11:37.679 --> 11:39.680
Now that I made 'em all pretty,

11:39.681 --> 11:42.649
the pound will have
to give me that fourth cat.

11:42.650 --> 11:45.085
(yawns) Ah, time to get some shut-eye.

11:45.086 --> 11:46.520
(shrieking)

11:46.521 --> 11:48.522
The apocalypse is upon us!

11:48.523 --> 11:53.227
Why?! Why must the world end
right when I'm getting sleepy?!

11:53.261 --> 11:55.262
What's happening?

11:55.263 --> 11:57.264
Oh, it's how she sleeps.
Don't worry about it.

11:57.265 --> 11:59.500
But there is an apocalypse. Ah!

11:59.534 --> 12:02.369
Every human is dead except for me!

12:02.370 --> 12:04.204
Especially the men!

12:04.205 --> 12:05.606
So there's no men!

12:05.607 --> 12:07.608
So it's okay to sleep alone.

12:07.609 --> 12:10.077
Good night, kids.
Night, Aunt Gayle.

12:10.078 --> 12:12.246
Gayle had 'em
in the cat salon for hours.

12:12.280 --> 12:14.381
Well, Louise has to be
cracking a little, right?

12:14.382 --> 12:16.283
But we need to push her over the top.

12:16.284 --> 12:19.119
Hmm. Wait, wait, wait. Remember
when Gayle hosted a game night

12:19.120 --> 12:21.221
and made us play the
board game she invented?

12:21.222 --> 12:23.624
<i>Gayle Force Winds?</i>
Yes! <i>Gayle Force Winds!</i>

12:23.625 --> 12:26.059
We should get the kids to
play that. It's horrible.

12:26.060 --> 12:28.462
The rules don't make any sense,
it takes all day to play it...

12:28.463 --> 12:31.131
Yes!<i> Gayle Force Winds</i>
will drive Louise nuts.

12:31.132 --> 12:33.300
All right, sex time!
Oh, my God, right.

12:33.301 --> 12:35.302
We can do that, 'cause
they-they're gone.

12:35.303 --> 12:37.137
Yeah...
Let's do it.

12:37.138 --> 12:39.640
(chuckling): Yeah. Let's go!

12:41.376 --> 12:44.044
You want me to win.
Yes, I did it!

12:44.045 --> 12:45.279
Ha! Ha! Ha!

12:45.280 --> 12:46.880
Ha. Eh, hmm.

12:46.915 --> 12:48.982
So, what do you kids want to do today?

12:48.983 --> 12:50.584
You're looking at it, babe.

12:50.585 --> 12:53.754
Okay, great. How does
butter sound for lunch?

12:53.755 --> 12:56.089
(phone vibrates) What,
am I gonna say no to a butter lunch?

12:56.124 --> 12:58.892
Hmm. Hey, Aunt Gayle, I wish there
was a board game that we could play

12:58.893 --> 13:01.628
that stimulates the imagination
but that was too good

13:01.629 --> 13:03.730
for the major board game
companies to even touch.

13:03.731 --> 13:06.466
(gasps) I made a board game
that stimulates the imagination

13:06.501 --> 13:09.336
but that was too good for the major
board game companies to even touch!

13:09.337 --> 13:10.671
Oh, I got to make room.

13:12.173 --> 13:13.607
(grunting) Uh, what's happening now?

13:13.608 --> 13:14.942
Why are you looking at me?

13:14.943 --> 13:17.144
I'm on the same moving couch as you.

13:17.178 --> 13:19.213
So if Louise makes it
to tomorrow morning,

13:19.247 --> 13:20.814
she doesn't have to
get the filling? Right.

13:20.815 --> 13:22.416
But if Gayle's craziness
drives her out,

13:22.417 --> 13:23.984
she loses.
Mm-hmm.

13:23.985 --> 13:25.919
And yet she wins 'cause
her cavity will be filled.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.754
That's right.
Pretty high-level parenting.

13:27.789 --> 13:28.856
Yeah. We know what we're doing, Teddy.

13:28.857 --> 13:30.090
Pretty badass.

13:30.124 --> 13:31.525
But what if Louise flies the coop

13:31.526 --> 13:32.826
and just goes somewhere else?

13:32.827 --> 13:34.127
Oh...

13:34.162 --> 13:35.596
Whoa. You didn't even think
of that, Bobby?

13:35.597 --> 13:36.797
Well, I mean, it's been...

13:36.798 --> 13:38.632
You have no contingency plan in place?

13:38.633 --> 13:41.068
I... Teddy,
it's been mostly Linda's thing.

13:41.102 --> 13:43.737
So we'll, uh... we'll
stake out Gayle's apartment.

13:43.771 --> 13:45.839
Oh, a stakeout.
That sounds fun!

13:45.840 --> 13:48.175
Hey! Get takeout
for your stakeout. Huh?

13:48.209 --> 13:50.043
Maybe you could order steak,
have a takeout-steak stakeout.

13:50.044 --> 13:51.345
I'll get the menus!

13:51.379 --> 13:53.313
It's called <i>Gayle Force Winds.</i>

13:53.314 --> 13:54.781
It's more than just a board game.

13:54.816 --> 13:56.817
It's about love and war and fantasy

13:56.818 --> 13:58.585
and plagues and fashion.

13:58.620 --> 13:59.820
Cool. So how do we play it?

13:59.854 --> 14:01.855
Princess Gayle must save
the five realms

14:01.856 --> 14:04.024
of Worldlandia from the evil winds

14:04.025 --> 14:06.026
sent by the wicked sorceress, Rebecca,

14:06.027 --> 14:07.528
who thinks she's <i> so</i> cute.

14:07.529 --> 14:08.762
She lives upstairs.

14:08.796 --> 14:10.797
Louise, you go first.

14:12.133 --> 14:15.202
Uh-oh, you landed
in Sponge'in Dungeon.

14:15.236 --> 14:17.471
You got to sit with
this wet sponge on your head

14:17.505 --> 14:20.174
for 30 minutes. (quietly):
This game seems pretty weird.

14:20.175 --> 14:24.011
Maybe we should go home. I'd rather sit
here with a wet sponge on my head all day

14:24.012 --> 14:26.580
than get that stupid filling.

14:26.581 --> 14:29.016
LINDA: <i>Nice romantic stakeout.</i>

14:29.050 --> 14:31.051
What is that smell? Oh.

14:31.052 --> 14:33.987
Bobby, Linda,
what are you doing here? Teddy?

14:34.022 --> 14:37.424
What are you doing here? I was just gonna
park over there for a few hours and then, uh,

14:37.425 --> 14:39.359
I happened to see you guys
were here, and I thought

14:39.360 --> 14:41.728
I'd just kind of...
Wait, are you crashing our stakeout?

14:41.763 --> 14:43.230
What? No.

14:43.264 --> 14:45.199
I brought pizza!
Ooh, pizza. Hand it over.

14:45.200 --> 14:48.202
So what'd I miss?
You guys taking copious notes?

14:48.203 --> 14:50.604
Can you... can... Do you mind
both just scooting up

14:50.605 --> 14:52.773
(Linda and Bob grunt) just
a little bit? A little more.

14:52.774 --> 14:54.107
(Linda and Bob grunt) Is that it?

14:54.108 --> 14:55.609
Mmm.
That's as far as it can go?

14:55.610 --> 14:57.244
Should we all just move over
to my truck?

14:57.245 --> 14:58.579
Teddy.
Uh, you know what, I'm fine.

14:58.580 --> 14:59.580
I'll make it work.

14:59.581 --> 15:01.148
Can you mind cracking a window?

15:01.182 --> 15:03.183
GENE: Aw, man!
I landed in Cold Sore-ia.

15:03.184 --> 15:04.384
(grumbles)

15:04.419 --> 15:06.653
Oh, that's hard.
You can ask Tina

15:06.688 --> 15:08.188
for some of her magic ointment.

15:08.223 --> 15:09.890
But I clucked
like an enchanted chicken

15:09.891 --> 15:11.892
for 20 minutes
to get this magic ointment.

15:11.893 --> 15:13.660
I don't know...

15:13.695 --> 15:18.398
Uh-oh. Your indecision has upset
the Gayle Force Winds.

15:18.433 --> 15:19.566
(whooshing sounds)

15:21.536 --> 15:23.036
(grunts)

15:23.071 --> 15:26.039
Everyone has to start over! No!

15:26.074 --> 15:28.075
We've been playing this game
for six hours

15:28.076 --> 15:30.577
and no one has even made it
past the Cliffs of Huxtable!

15:30.578 --> 15:33.413
(moans) That cavity's really
bothering you, Louise.

15:33.414 --> 15:36.316
What's it to you? Whose side are
you on? Don't you want me to win?

15:36.317 --> 15:37.751
Stay cool.
I'm on your side.

15:37.752 --> 15:39.253
Team Louise all the way.

15:39.287 --> 15:40.687
Why are you talking like that?

15:40.722 --> 15:42.556
Like what?
This is how I always talk.

15:42.557 --> 15:44.992
Wait, now I don't remember
how I talk. Is this how I sound?

15:44.993 --> 15:48.195
Never mind. Just help me
get past Rebecca's monkey army.

15:48.229 --> 15:49.930
(phone vibrates) Oh...

15:49.931 --> 15:52.099
Tina says Louise is losing it.

15:52.133 --> 15:55.135
(Teddy snoring) Hopefully our little
girl's about to snap. (chuckles)

15:55.136 --> 15:58.438
Yeah, let's hope it's soon.
Teddy's apnea is making me sick.

15:58.473 --> 15:59.473
(snoring)

15:59.474 --> 16:01.642
(snoring stops)

16:01.643 --> 16:03.377
(coughing)

16:03.411 --> 16:05.412
Oh, God. Thank God.
That one was, like, six seconds.

16:05.413 --> 16:09.116
He's breathing again. I mean,
how lo... how long before you die?

16:09.117 --> 16:10.784
(birds chirping)

16:10.785 --> 16:12.986
I did it.
I made it through the weekend.

16:12.987 --> 16:14.855
I don't have to get the filling!

16:14.856 --> 16:17.624
I win, I win!
Let's all celebrate with more sleep

16:17.625 --> 16:19.186
and no more talking.
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm!

16:19.194 --> 16:20.594
Morning, sleepyheads.

16:20.595 --> 16:22.596
Oh, my God, did we
sleep through the night?

16:22.597 --> 16:24.431
We sure did. Never slept better.

16:24.432 --> 16:26.266
Linda. Linda.
Wha...

16:26.267 --> 16:27.935
Did you know that you snore?

16:27.936 --> 16:30.337
What happened? Did we win?
What-What's going on?

16:30.338 --> 16:31.605
It's morning.
Damn it.

16:31.606 --> 16:33.440
That little bugger pulled it off.

16:33.441 --> 16:35.943
She beat us.
(grunts) That's not an option, Lin.

16:35.944 --> 16:38.445
She needs to get that filling
or else her teeth are gonna fall out.

16:38.446 --> 16:41.448
Okay. I was hoping
it wouldn't come to this.

16:41.449 --> 16:44.084
We're gonna have to make
our baby feel some pain.

16:44.119 --> 16:45.352
Oh, wow.

16:45.353 --> 16:46.854
Y-You did it, Louise!

16:46.855 --> 16:48.455
How about a victory breakfast
of ice cream?

16:48.456 --> 16:51.158
Thanks, T, that's a great idea.

16:53.394 --> 16:55.028
(Louise screaming)

16:56.531 --> 16:58.132
My baby!
(sobs)

16:58.133 --> 16:59.967
Our baby!
We had to do it.

16:59.968 --> 17:01.368
(crying) It was the only way!

17:01.369 --> 17:03.003
(cries)

17:03.037 --> 17:04.471
(screaming)

17:04.472 --> 17:06.334
You gonna finish that?

17:08.079 --> 17:10.448
(doorbell rings)
Make it stop, make it stop!

17:10.449 --> 17:13.451
Knock, knock, time to pick up
some runaways. Ow, ow, ow,

17:13.452 --> 17:16.721
(gps), no, what's wrong, Louise?
ow, ow, ow.

17:16.756 --> 17:20.391
She ate a bite of ice cream,
and I guess it upset her cavity. Aw.

17:20.425 --> 17:21.992
Louise couldn't handle her high.

17:21.993 --> 17:24.729
Why-why is Teddy here?
Yeah.

17:24.763 --> 17:26.396
Why are any of us here?
Think about that.

17:26.397 --> 17:28.400
Whoa. You kids got further
in <i> Gayle Force Winds</i>

17:28.401 --> 17:30.068
than I thought you would.

17:30.102 --> 17:33.037
Wait, you knew we were playing
<i>Gayle Force Winds?</i> Ow.

17:33.072 --> 17:34.973
Um, I-I didn't.
I just, um...

17:34.974 --> 17:36.975
What-What's, uh...
what's <i> Gayle Force Winds?</i>

17:37.009 --> 17:40.011
Oh, now I get it. You guys
were behind all of this.

17:40.012 --> 17:43.248
You cheated!
How could you?! Ow!

17:43.282 --> 17:45.283
Tina helped us cheat! What?! Mom!

17:45.284 --> 17:47.752
Sorry, it's true. We cheated
because we love you, honey.

17:47.753 --> 17:48.887
Yeah.

17:48.921 --> 17:50.655
Oh, that is disgusting.

17:50.656 --> 17:52.757
I hate you guys right no
I can't believe it.

17:52.792 --> 17:54.793
Louise, you got to get that filling.

17:54.827 --> 17:57.929
I'm fine! Ow!
Honey,

17:57.963 --> 18:00.965
now you listen to me.
I know you're afraid. I'm not afraid!

18:00.966 --> 18:03.802
Oh... Aw, screw it!
I'm afraid, I'm afraid!

18:03.803 --> 18:05.637
I know a little something about fear.

18:05.638 --> 18:08.473
You've seen my life.
Yeah. It's bad.

18:08.474 --> 18:12.478
So why don't you let Aunt Gayle
help you get through this, okay?

18:12.479 --> 18:15.647
We're gonna turn your
fear-believe into make-belie.

18:15.648 --> 18:17.315
That's not gonna work.

18:17.316 --> 18:19.484
(moans, hisses) Let's do it.

18:19.485 --> 18:22.153
Great! Now, what character
do you want to play?

18:22.154 --> 18:25.146
(dramatic orchestral music playing)

18:29.328 --> 18:30.628
(moans, hisses)

18:32.398 --> 18:34.399
You've been briefed of
the situation. I have.

18:34.400 --> 18:36.468
This is the asset I spoke about.
Is the asset

18:36.502 --> 18:39.637
willing to do whatever's
necessary to save the universe?

18:39.672 --> 18:42.006
She is.
And the asset promises not to...

18:42.007 --> 18:43.808
bite me during the procedure?

18:43.843 --> 18:46.010
The asset promises.
Then why the hell

18:46.011 --> 18:48.213
are we out here
wasting time, damn it?!

18:48.214 --> 18:50.515
Let's go!
Let's men!

18:50.549 --> 18:52.450
Sector eight, clear!

18:52.485 --> 18:53.218
Sectors ninend ten,

18:53.219 --> 18:55.453
clear!
Ow.

18:55.488 --> 18:58.490
That pain is a toxin from our
enemy's ice cream serum.

18:58.491 --> 19:00.792
The antidote is in this needle.

19:00.826 --> 19:02.527
Ooh! Oh...

19:02.561 --> 19:03.828
Ooh, I don't know...

19:03.863 --> 19:05.196
Okay, no!
You must.

19:05.197 --> 19:08.189
The whole universe
is counting on you, kid.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.034
(sighs) Proceed.

19:10.035 --> 19:11.369
Ow!

19:11.403 --> 19:13.404
Very good. You should be
completely numb

19:13.405 --> 19:14.873
in just a few seconds.

19:16.242 --> 19:17.242
Now, this might look like

19:17.243 --> 19:18.910
ordinary porcelain filling

19:18.911 --> 19:21.980
from a sad, lonely
dentist's office, but this is

19:22.014 --> 19:23.815
a microchip of our plans

19:23.849 --> 19:26.518
for the most amazing
weapon system ever.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.621
(whirring) Oh, wait. Wait a minute.

19:31.123 --> 19:32.524
Oh, no! Our enemies are here!

19:32.558 --> 19:33.557
(mimicking gunshots) Ah!

19:35.361 --> 19:37.362
(strained):
Louise, the mission must go on.

19:37.363 --> 19:38.763
Do it!

19:38.798 --> 19:39.531
(drilling)

19:39.532 --> 19:40.865
Get him!

19:40.866 --> 19:42.434
Cover me, Bobby!
Go, go, go!

19:42.435 --> 19:44.002
Grenade!
(mimics explosion)

19:44.036 --> 19:46.337
Ah!
Flamethrower!

19:46.372 --> 19:49.340
Okay... Okay, all right, all right.

19:49.375 --> 19:52.277
(screaming) I'm hit! I'm hit!
I'm taking fire here!

19:52.278 --> 19:54.712
You got to call in
some air support! This is crazy!

19:54.713 --> 19:55.980
We get the point!

19:55.981 --> 19:57.816
Geez.
We got you.

19:57.817 --> 20:00.085
Okay. You may have shot me
too many times,

20:00.086 --> 20:03.154
but our cause will never die.

20:03.155 --> 20:05.156
You did it, Louise.
I did it?

20:05.157 --> 20:06.758
You did it.
And it didn't...

20:06.759 --> 20:09.427
inconvenience...
anyone... at all.

20:09.428 --> 20:11.129
(exhales)

20:11.130 --> 20:13.998
I'll hug him back to life!
(grunting)

20:13.999 --> 20:16.067
Okay, I'm fine.
Yeah, yeah, Tina, he's fine.

20:16.068 --> 20:17.435
Don't do that. Okay. No. Almost there!

20:17.470 --> 20:19.137
Tina, let-let him go. Almost there!

20:19.171 --> 20:20.271
Tina, get up.

20:20.272 --> 20:23.208
(mimicking gunshots)

20:23.242 --> 20:25.477
When you get to the toy basket,
get the squirt ring!

20:25.478 --> 20:28.480
The squirt ring!
The future depends on it.

20:30.249 --> 20:31.816
Hey, you were good in there.

20:31.817 --> 20:34.486
You, too. I'd do a
mission with you anytime.

20:34.487 --> 20:37.489
I hate to say it, but I think
Gayle out-parented us.

20:37.490 --> 20:39.858
Maybe we should let her
watch the kids more often.

20:39.859 --> 20:42.694
Oh, maybe Gayle could move in
with us, be our full-time nanny.

20:42.695 --> 20:45.096
I'm gonna call your
bluff on that. Yes.

20:45.097 --> 20:47.098
No. No, no. Too late. It's done.

20:47.099 --> 20:49.734
See you at home, Gayle.
Gotcha! (groans)

20:49.769 --> 20:52.504
"Happy Things
We Should Send Into Space."

20:52.505 --> 20:54.339
A jar of mayo.

20:54.340 --> 20:57.008
Magazine clippings of Scott Baio.

20:57.009 --> 21:00.092
That song that starts with "Day-O."

21:01.881 --> 21:03.882
Little cat, you're just like me.

21:03.883 --> 21:06.551
You go outside and squat to pee.

21:06.552 --> 21:09.320
Squat! Squat!

21:09.321 --> 21:10.722
Squat!

21:10.723 --> 21:12.557
Squat!

21:12.558 --> 21:14.358
(clears throat)
