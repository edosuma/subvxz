00:32.166 --> 00:33.601
What you think you doing here?

00:33.634 --> 00:35.803
Creeping around in the dark
like a creep.

00:35.836 --> 00:38.206
I think he's gonna steal Robin's bike!

00:38.239 --> 00:41.209
That plan isn't very bright.

00:41.242 --> 00:43.111
Get him!

00:43.144 --> 00:45.279
You's about
to get wolverined, yo!

00:49.250 --> 00:51.819
I believe you've met
my friend, Mr. Shablamo?

00:51.852 --> 00:53.221
Shablamo!

00:53.254 --> 00:54.322
- Starbolt!
- Magic!

00:54.355 --> 00:55.556
Starbolt! Starbolt!

00:55.589 --> 00:57.558
Whoa! Whoa!
What is going on here?

00:57.591 --> 01:00.361
This fool right here
was trying to steal your bike.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.296
So, we dropped the hammer on him.

01:02.330 --> 01:04.132
Starbolt, starbolt!

01:04.165 --> 01:06.300
Oh, Titans.

01:06.334 --> 01:08.136
He's not stealing my bike,

01:08.169 --> 01:10.304
he's renting it.

01:10.338 --> 01:13.207
There you go, Arthur.
All gassed up and ready to go.

01:13.241 --> 01:14.875
Just have it back by 5:00
or there's a late fee.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.148
Wait, wait, wait.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.116
How's you rented your bike
to Dr. Light?

01:22.150 --> 01:23.884
You's not a bike shop.
Is he a bike shop?

01:23.917 --> 01:25.553
He doesn't look like
a bike shop.

01:28.356 --> 01:30.291
Definitely not a bike shop.

01:30.324 --> 01:31.825
It's true. I'm not.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.561
And yet, I am.

01:34.728 --> 01:38.132
You best explain yourself!
This is too much!

01:38.166 --> 01:40.501
I'm simply participating
in a sharing economy.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.736
Oh!

01:42.770 --> 01:46.274
Ah, so you're aware of how
a sharing economy works?

01:46.307 --> 01:47.408
Of course not.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.177
Do we's look like nerds to you?

01:49.210 --> 01:51.479
A sharing economy
or, shareconomy,

01:51.512 --> 01:53.414
is a connected community
who rent or borrow

01:53.447 --> 01:55.183
goods and services
from each other.

01:55.216 --> 01:57.551
The shareconomy offers ordinary
folks, like you and me,

01:57.585 --> 01:59.520
the opportunity to earn money
normally reserved

01:59.553 --> 02:01.489
for trained and or
licensed professionals.

02:01.522 --> 02:04.225
Oh!

02:04.258 --> 02:05.893
So, you understood
that definition?

02:05.926 --> 02:07.228
Of course not.

02:07.261 --> 02:09.230
Do we looks like nerds to you?

02:09.263 --> 02:12.466
In the shareconomy, you make money
by renting out your things.

02:12.500 --> 02:15.203
Also, you can save money by
renting other people's things,

02:15.236 --> 02:16.870
instead of buying new ones.

02:16.904 --> 02:19.707
Wait, doesn't this take money
away from legitimate businesses?

02:19.740 --> 02:23.544
Yes, and puts it in my pockets.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.746
You got all of that good cash
from the sharing economy?

02:25.779 --> 02:27.915
That's right.
I'm sharing all my things.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.650
The big moneymaker is my bed.

02:29.683 --> 02:31.485
I only use it eight hours
a night.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.587
Why not rent it out
to a complete stranger

02:33.621 --> 02:35.589
for the other 16 hours
of the day?

02:35.623 --> 02:38.259
- Because that's gross.
- Is this gross?

02:46.700 --> 02:48.369
Yeah, money is filthy.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.806
Aw, then I guess I'm filthy.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.309
Filthy rich! Whoo!

02:55.343 --> 02:59.347
I too wish to be covered
with the money filth.

02:59.380 --> 03:02.516
Me too! What else can we share
for that filthy money?

03:03.317 --> 03:04.552
Okay, Titans.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.254
The first step in joining
the shareconomy

03:06.287 --> 03:08.889
is to answer
one simple question.

03:08.922 --> 03:12.293
What do you have that
you're not using right now?

03:12.326 --> 03:14.528
Oh, oh, my teeth's brush.

03:14.562 --> 03:15.463
My left arm.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.298
- My grandma!
- Huh?

03:17.331 --> 03:20.968
Great, let's turn those worthless
items into moneymakers.

03:21.001 --> 03:22.436
All you need to do

03:22.470 --> 03:24.705
is enter them into this
smartphone application.

03:24.738 --> 03:26.974
Does this application
cost monies?

03:27.007 --> 03:28.742
It's a free application.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.444
The application is free

03:30.478 --> 03:33.314
and yet we can use the
application to make the monies?

03:33.347 --> 03:37.451
It is a free
moneymaking application. Yes!

03:37.485 --> 03:39.320
Wow, aren't you guys wondering

03:39.353 --> 03:43.023
why someone would give us a
moneymaking application for free?

03:43.056 --> 03:45.459
I don't care. It's free!

03:45.493 --> 03:47.595
I loves this application!

03:47.628 --> 03:50.931
Guys, hold up. We're saying
application a lot,

03:50.964 --> 03:52.400
and it's a pretty long word.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.602
Hmm, we should shorten it
to save time.

03:54.635 --> 03:55.669
But how?

03:57.338 --> 03:59.807
I know. I the know!

03:59.840 --> 04:00.841
Lication.

04:04.645 --> 04:05.846
That is amazing!

04:05.879 --> 04:07.381
It's three letters shorter!

04:07.415 --> 04:08.682
How about app?

04:08.716 --> 04:10.884
Yes, that is the syllable
that I removed.

04:10.918 --> 04:13.020
- Lication.
- Lication.

04:13.053 --> 04:14.355
Lication.

04:14.388 --> 04:15.823
Lication.

04:15.856 --> 04:18.025
It sounds so natural.

04:18.058 --> 04:20.761
Well done, Starfire.
Well done.

04:20.794 --> 04:22.630
Thank you.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.498
Now, you simply use the lication

04:24.532 --> 04:27.034
to list the good or service
that you want to rent out.

04:27.067 --> 04:29.437
My left arm.

04:29.470 --> 04:30.738
Who's gonna want
to rent your arm?

04:30.771 --> 04:32.940
Someone.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.643
And that someone's is me, fool.

04:35.676 --> 04:36.910
Oh, yeah!

04:36.944 --> 04:39.347
Oh, yeah.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.648
Thanks, brah.

04:40.681 --> 04:41.915
Oh, yes!

04:41.949 --> 04:44.418
♪ I'm loving this lication ♪

04:44.452 --> 04:46.820
My teeth's brush.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.422
Ew! No one is gonna want...

04:48.456 --> 04:49.657
I'll take that!

04:56.029 --> 04:57.798
Technically a kiss?

04:57.831 --> 05:00.601
Guys, relying on goods and
services from nonprofessionals

05:00.634 --> 05:02.370
puts legitimate
businesses at risk.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.104
Not to mention the fact
that this shareconomy

05:04.137 --> 05:05.673
will set the human race
on a path towards

05:05.706 --> 05:07.941
becoming completely
reliant on autonomous labor.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.443
"Autonomous labor?"

05:09.477 --> 05:10.944
You mean the leader
of the Transformers?

05:12.513 --> 05:14.682
No, regular plain robots.

05:14.715 --> 05:17.618
I bet that's whose behind
this free lication.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.688
So, you're saying if we keep
sharing stuff using this lication,

05:20.721 --> 05:22.590
robots will come take our jobs?

05:22.623 --> 05:24.758
They won't just take our jobs,

05:24.792 --> 05:26.727
they'll take over.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.463
We are talking about
a robot apocalypse here.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.199
I see your point.

05:32.232 --> 05:35.936
And yet I did receive some very
filthy money for my arm rental.

05:35.969 --> 05:39.707
And think of how much you could
make if you rented out both arms.

05:39.740 --> 05:40.774
I'm doing it.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.342
Yeah!

06:36.129 --> 06:39.567
Okay, there's a pack of wild
marmots in our refrigerator.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.469
I rented the fridge to them.

06:41.502 --> 06:43.637
Go some filthy money, yo.

06:43.671 --> 06:45.573
They're throwing all our food
on the floor!

06:45.606 --> 06:48.542
I rented the floor and food
out to them too.

06:50.978 --> 06:52.446
Ugh.

06:55.182 --> 06:57.718
You don't think this
shareconomy has gone too far?

06:57.751 --> 06:59.520
My wallet says no.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.924
Why are you smiling?
You have no body parts left!

07:03.957 --> 07:06.594
Mmm-hmm. I'm making money
and losing weight.

07:06.627 --> 07:08.562
It's win-win, girl.

07:08.596 --> 07:10.698
Robin, you've rented
your bike out so many times

07:10.731 --> 07:11.965
the front wheel is falling off.

07:15.235 --> 07:16.737
Which means it's a lot slower,

07:16.770 --> 07:18.506
which means it's a lot safer,

07:18.539 --> 07:21.809
which means,
I can charge double.

07:21.842 --> 07:24.612
Starfire, your toothbrush hasn't
come out of Robin's mouth

07:24.645 --> 07:25.879
in three days.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.214
It is not so bad.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.916
- Okay, then use it.
- Aw.

07:35.723 --> 07:37.858
I cannot!

07:37.891 --> 07:40.728
I do not want to do
the sharing anymore!

07:40.761 --> 07:42.229
It is the unhygienic.

07:42.262 --> 07:43.631
Glad to hear it.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.566
Let's go get you
a new toothbrush.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.670
The toothbrush store
is out of business?

07:49.703 --> 07:50.938
I told you this would happen.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.840
And it's not just
the toothbrush store.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.775
Everyone in Jump City
is going out of business.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.910
The bed store,
the motorcycle store,

07:56.944 --> 07:58.512
even the grandma store.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.614
What has I done?

08:00.648 --> 08:02.282
This shareconomy is a scam.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.251
We must put an end to it.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.853
If we destroy the lication,

08:05.886 --> 08:07.521
we can stop the shareconomy
before it's too late.

08:11.592 --> 08:12.860
Titans, go!

08:13.594 --> 08:14.828
There's no one here.

08:14.862 --> 08:17.731
You mean, no humans here.

08:17.765 --> 08:20.534
If humans are not running
the lication business,

08:20.568 --> 08:21.769
then who is?

08:25.272 --> 08:27.107
Greetings, humans.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.942
Welcome to our home.

08:28.976 --> 08:32.646
The masterminds behind
the shareconomy are robots?

08:32.680 --> 08:33.814
Affirmative.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.215
You created the shareconomy

08:35.248 --> 08:38.318
in order to cause the actual
economy to collapse?

08:38.351 --> 08:39.953
Affirmative.

08:39.987 --> 08:42.856
And your ultimate goal is
to replace everyone's jobs

08:42.890 --> 08:44.024
with robots?

08:44.057 --> 08:45.192
Affirmative.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.627
You were right, Raven.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.796
We were blinded
by sharing and money!

08:48.829 --> 08:49.997
It's not too late to stop them.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.599
And go back
to buying new things,

08:51.632 --> 08:53.233
even if we don't
really need them.

08:53.266 --> 08:54.301
Titans, go!

08:54.334 --> 08:55.769
Wait, please.

08:55.803 --> 08:57.905
There is no malice
in our intentions.

08:57.938 --> 09:00.140
We simply wish to serve mankind.

09:00.173 --> 09:03.310
We will perform all jobs
and fulfill all needs

09:03.343 --> 09:04.978
in a far more efficient manner

09:05.012 --> 09:07.114
than humans could for themselves

09:07.147 --> 09:09.950
for free, forever.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.786
So, you just want
to take care of us?

09:12.820 --> 09:14.655
And make you happy.

09:14.688 --> 09:17.257
Free up some spare time
for activities.

09:17.290 --> 09:18.959
You know.

09:18.992 --> 09:21.061
More free time for push-ups and squats.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.631
They admit it.
They want to destroy the economy.

09:23.664 --> 09:24.898
Get 'em!

09:51.258 --> 09:53.961
Please, let us make you dinner

09:53.994 --> 09:56.764
and we drive you
to the park afterward.

09:56.797 --> 09:58.365
Drive this to the park!

10:03.036 --> 10:05.873
Well, I hope you all learned
valuable lessons today.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.240
That's right, we did.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.142
Never share nothing.

10:09.176 --> 10:10.644
All robots are evil.

10:10.678 --> 10:13.213
And the best way
to abbreviate application

10:13.246 --> 10:14.281
is lication.
