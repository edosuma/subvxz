to put that stuff on hold

19:27.999 --> 19:30.335
for the moment
just until, you know,

19:30.368 --> 19:32.604
until I get the money
rolling back in again.

19:32.637 --> 19:34.706
Right, and the best way
to do that is for you

19:34.739 --> 19:36.808
to get in the studio
and make a great album,

19:36.841 --> 19:38.877
so let's get to it.

19:38.910 --> 19:39.878
What, what can I do to help?

19:39.911 --> 19:43.615
Yeah, uh, that part, um...

19:43.648 --> 19:46.384
I haven't produced
any new music

19:46.417 --> 19:48.986

an album three years ago.

19:51.789 --> 19:53.358

five years ago.

19:55.593 --> 19:59.331
And the tech company,

19:59.364 --> 20:01.766
just everything just got
so damn big, man.

20:01.799 --> 20:04.402
It takes time and money.

20:04.435 --> 20:07.304
I sit and try to write
and it's like,

20:07.338 --> 20:09.241
there's nothing there.
I've done--

20:09.274 --> 20:10.774
like I got too much
stuff in the air,

20:10.808 --> 20:11.777
I'm spread too thin.

20:14.312 --> 20:16.848
You know what?
It worked for me here, though.

20:16.881 --> 20:18.416
This hood.
This is--this is the hood

20:18.449 --> 20:20.285
that inspired me to do music
in the first place.

20:20.318 --> 20:22.320
Yeah. This is
where I need to be.

20:22.353 --> 20:23.888
Yeah. This creativity,
these kids,

20:23.921 --> 20:26.424
this is the vibe
that I need, yeah.

20:26.457 --> 20:28.460
Sage, you can't just
come back here

20:28.493 --> 20:31.396
and expect all your problems
to magically resolve themselves.

20:32.764 --> 20:34.265
That's not what I said.

20:34.299 --> 20:35.934
Yes, it is.

20:35.967 --> 20:38.403
I've been doing this
a long time, okay?

20:38.436 --> 20:39.603
I know what I'm doing.

20:39.637 --> 20:40.871
I'm gonna put this album out,

20:40.905 --> 20:42.674

21:04.562 --> 21:06.697
I didn't expect to see
your name on that list.

21:06.731 --> 21:08.533
The last name I expected
to see on that list,

21:08.566 --> 21:11.703

This album's gonna come out

21:11.736 --> 21:12.937
