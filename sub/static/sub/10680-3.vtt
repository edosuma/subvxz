WEBVTT

00:11.200 --> 00:13.760
[theme music playing]

00:21.680 --> 00:23.320
Or we could just

00:21.680 --> 00:23.320
buy me a hi-fi.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.800
Concentrate.

00:25.840 --> 00:29.320
Sid's gonna be spending

00:25.840 --> 00:29.320
more time in his baby stroller

00:25.840 --> 00:29.320
than anywhere else.

00:29.360 --> 00:32.360
It's like the office was

00:29.360 --> 00:32.360
for you when you were

00:29.360 --> 00:32.360
a working man.

00:32.400 --> 00:35.720
Ah, yes.

00:32.400 --> 00:35.720
Those happy times.

00:35.760 --> 00:37.120
That one with

00:35.760 --> 00:37.120
blue on it?

00:37.160 --> 00:38.720
What? With

00:37.160 --> 00:38.720
the aluminum frame?

00:38.760 --> 00:40.760
Then I don't know,

00:38.760 --> 00:40.760
Dale.

00:40.800 --> 00:44.360
What happened to the time

00:40.800 --> 00:44.360
when you chucked them in a pram

00:40.800 --> 00:44.360
and listened to Screamadelica.

00:44.640 --> 00:45.720
Ken!

00:46.880 --> 00:48.080
Jess.

00:48.120 --> 00:50.600
Haven't seen you since

00:48.120 --> 00:50.600
that time at the hospital.

00:50.640 --> 00:52.480
The time I gave birth!

00:50.640 --> 00:52.480
And you...

00:52.520 --> 00:54.800
Yeah, that time, yeah.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.800
How's motherhood?

00:54.840 --> 00:56.080
Loving it.

00:56.120 --> 00:57.760
And paternity leave?

00:57.800 --> 01:00.000
How does it feel

00:57.800 --> 01:00.000
to be a feminist icon?

01:00.040 --> 01:01.200
What can I say?

01:01.240 --> 01:04.040
-I'm a hero

01:01.240 --> 01:04.040
to all women.

01:01.240 --> 01:04.040
-[laughing]

01:05.840 --> 01:07.840
Yes, the stroller debate.

01:07.880 --> 01:10.520
Marc and I

01:07.880 --> 01:10.520
went for that one.

01:07.880 --> 01:10.520
The Jill Cotterill.

01:10.560 --> 01:13.720
Durable, light,

01:10.560 --> 01:13.720
turns into a car seat.

01:13.760 --> 01:15.720
Oh, gosh,

01:13.760 --> 01:15.720
she's a beauty!

01:16.960 --> 01:20.240
And so this horrific

01:16.960 --> 01:20.240
experience draws to a close.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.120
-I owe you Jess.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.120
-[laughing]

01:22.160 --> 01:24.440
Don't be silly.

01:24.480 --> 01:30.120
I'm doing this mom's group

01:24.480 --> 01:30.120
thing with some

01:24.480 --> 01:30.120
of the girls from NCT.

01:30.160 --> 01:31.560
You should come.

01:31.600 --> 01:36.880
Bloke at a mom's group.

01:31.600 --> 01:36.880
Think that might be

01:31.600 --> 01:36.880
a bit weird.

01:36.920 --> 01:40.240
I said to the doctor.

01:36.920 --> 01:40.240
Hey sonny,

01:36.920 --> 01:40.240
what about my mastitis?

01:40.280 --> 01:41.520
[laughing]

01:42.400 --> 01:44.440
Right,

01:42.400 --> 01:44.440
cake o'clock I think.

01:44.480 --> 01:46.600
Don't you shake your

01:44.480 --> 01:46.600
head at me, Jenny.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.120
That baby weight

01:46.640 --> 01:50.120
is dropping right off,

01:46.640 --> 01:50.120
you bloody deserve it.

01:50.160 --> 01:51.760
Excuse me

01:50.160 --> 01:51.760
for a second, ladies.

01:54.120 --> 01:55.920
Cake report.

01:55.960 --> 01:58.720
This is gonna be

01:55.960 --> 01:58.720
the best darn coffee cake

01:55.960 --> 01:58.720
those girls have ever tasted.

01:58.760 --> 02:01.240
Who would've thought

01:58.760 --> 02:01.240
mom's group

01:58.760 --> 02:01.240
would be so ace?

02:01.280 --> 02:02.920
I know.

02:02.960 --> 02:05.920
We get to enjoy the fun

02:02.960 --> 02:05.920
and gossiping, but

02:02.960 --> 02:05.920
avoid the catty in-fighting.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.640
Beth said your

02:05.960 --> 02:07.640
fruitcake was dry.

02:08.680 --> 02:09.960
That prissy

02:08.680 --> 02:09.960
little tart.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.160
-Right.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.160
-[laughing]

02:11.200 --> 02:12.720
Left the stuff

02:11.200 --> 02:12.720
for my meeting!

02:14.040 --> 02:15.680
How's your

02:14.040 --> 02:15.680
coffee morning going?

02:15.720 --> 02:18.480
Tremendously!

02:15.720 --> 02:18.480
Ken has a

02:15.720 --> 02:18.480
foolproof system.

02:18.520 --> 02:20.360
-I do.

02:18.520 --> 02:20.360
-I prepare all the food.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.000
Clean the house

02:20.400 --> 02:22.000
and wash up.

02:22.040 --> 02:24.680
Ken is the social face

02:22.040 --> 02:24.680
of the operation

02:24.720 --> 02:27.200
occupying the guests,

02:24.720 --> 02:27.200
checking the food is tasty.

02:27.240 --> 02:28.600
That sounds

02:27.240 --> 02:28.600
about right.

02:28.640 --> 02:31.480
Right, now, you wash up.

02:28.640 --> 02:31.480
You, come and meet the girls.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.000
So everyone...

02:33.040 --> 02:36.000
Oh, Ken, busted!

02:36.040 --> 02:38.400
Now Laura's gonna

02:36.040 --> 02:38.400
know about your

02:36.040 --> 02:38.400
daytime harem!

02:38.440 --> 02:39.400
[laughing]

02:39.440 --> 02:41.360
They're not a harem.

02:41.400 --> 02:45.240
Well, I think we would

02:41.400 --> 02:45.240
all like to thank you for

02:41.400 --> 02:45.240
letting us borrow him, Laura.

02:45.280 --> 02:46.840
With Marc

02:45.280 --> 02:46.840
off in Dubai,

02:46.880 --> 02:49.280
Ken's the only

02:46.880 --> 02:49.280
male company I get.

02:49.320 --> 02:52.120
I hope he's not droning on

02:49.320 --> 02:52.120
about history too much.

02:52.160 --> 02:54.840
-Alright you.

02:52.160 --> 02:54.840
-Why would you

02:52.160 --> 02:54.840
say that, Laura?

02:54.880 --> 02:58.480
Ken is a fascinating intellect.

02:54.880 --> 02:58.480
I hope you appreciate him.

02:58.520 --> 03:00.600
I do.

02:58.520 --> 03:00.600
And it's Lorna.

03:00.640 --> 03:03.400
-What's Lorna, Laura?

03:00.640 --> 03:03.400
-My name it's Lorna.

03:03.760 --> 03:05.760
What? No!

03:05.800 --> 03:08.000
Oh, my God,

03:05.800 --> 03:08.000
I'm so sorry!

03:08.040 --> 03:11.000
So embarrassing!

03:08.040 --> 03:11.000
Lorna!

03:12.080 --> 03:15.640
Lorna. Not Laura.

03:12.080 --> 03:15.640
Lorna.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.600
Okay, Well.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.600
Back to work.

03:20.680 --> 03:22.640
Oh! By the way,

03:22.680 --> 03:25.360
save the 25th

03:22.680 --> 03:25.360
for Eliza's christening.

03:25.400 --> 03:28.520
You should be

03:25.400 --> 03:28.520
there, Ken. Seeing as you

03:25.400 --> 03:28.520
were there at lift off.

03:28.560 --> 03:29.600
What?

03:29.640 --> 03:31.320
How do you mean

03:29.640 --> 03:31.320
"There for lift off?"

03:31.360 --> 03:33.960
What Jess means is we

03:31.360 --> 03:33.960
were both at the same hospital

03:34.000 --> 03:35.840
when the babies came.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.840
Right, Jess?

03:35.880 --> 03:38.560
Right. Well,

03:35.880 --> 03:38.560
so just think about it!

03:40.920 --> 03:43.040
-She's a headcase.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.040
-No, she's okay.

03:43.080 --> 03:46.120
Nope, she's a headcase.

03:43.080 --> 03:46.120
See you later.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.520
Squeeze Sid for me.

03:51.440 --> 03:52.960
[sighs]

03:53.000 --> 03:55.360
Jess.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.360
What was that about?

03:55.400 --> 03:58.440
Of course I haven't

03:55.400 --> 03:58.440
told Lorna that I was

03:55.400 --> 03:58.440
at Eliza's birth!

03:58.480 --> 04:00.200
What?

03:58.480 --> 04:00.200
You haven't told her?

04:00.240 --> 04:02.400
No, I haven't

04:00.240 --> 04:02.400
told her.

04:02.440 --> 04:04.600
Because of you,

04:02.440 --> 04:04.600
I missed Sid's birth.

04:04.640 --> 04:07.120
If Lorna finds out,

04:04.640 --> 04:07.120
I'll be murdered

04:04.640 --> 04:07.120
in my sleep.

04:07.160 --> 04:08.280
Keep it to yourself.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.880
Well, it's a bit weird.

04:10.920 --> 04:15.240
I mean, so what?

04:10.920 --> 04:15.240
You held my hand

04:10.920 --> 04:15.240
as I gave birth.

04:15.280 --> 04:17.480
It was an act of kindness.

04:17.520 --> 04:20.560
Plus you wouldn't

04:17.520 --> 04:20.560
let go of my hand, so...

04:20.600 --> 04:25.600
Oh, Ken, I just want to

04:20.600 --> 04:25.600
make it clear, I'm happily

04:20.600 --> 04:25.600
married to Marc.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.200
So am I!

04:27.240 --> 04:29.720
Very happily.

04:27.240 --> 04:29.720
Not to Marc.

04:27.240 --> 04:29.720
To Laura. Lorna.

04:29.760 --> 04:32.800
Well, okay, so then,

04:29.760 --> 04:32.800
please tell your wife.

04:32.840 --> 04:36.560
Because whatever problems

04:32.840 --> 04:36.560
you and Laura having,

04:36.600 --> 04:41.680
I just don't want to

04:36.600 --> 04:41.680
be part of them.

04:36.600 --> 04:41.680
Okay, lecture over.

04:41.720 --> 04:42.920
[giggles]

04:44.160 --> 04:45.440
But...

04:45.480 --> 04:48.280
Ling is thousands

04:45.480 --> 04:48.280
of miles away,

04:48.320 --> 04:50.400
so how come our love

04:48.320 --> 04:50.400
feels even stronger?

04:51.640 --> 04:54.800
And if love transcends

04:51.640 --> 04:54.800
time and space,

04:54.840 --> 04:57.200
perhaps therein lies

04:54.840 --> 04:57.200
the secret of the universe.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.600
What do you

04:58.360 --> 04:59.600
think Dylan?

04:59.640 --> 05:02.240
Couldn't give

04:59.640 --> 05:02.240
a shit, mate.

05:02.280 --> 05:05.120
Hey. What's that game

05:02.280 --> 05:05.120
you're playing on your

05:02.280 --> 05:05.120
robot phone?

05:05.160 --> 05:07.400
Not a game,

05:05.160 --> 05:07.400
you bell-end.

05:05.160 --> 05:07.400
It's Love Swipe.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.120
Ah, fuck, I just

05:07.440 --> 05:09.120
liked a munter.

05:09.160 --> 05:11.600
Love Swipe is a way

05:09.160 --> 05:11.600
of finding romantic partners?

05:11.640 --> 05:14.440
No, it's hunting

05:11.640 --> 05:14.440
willing snatch.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.840
Here, have a look.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.560
Right, okay.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.560
So here we have,

05:18.600 --> 05:20.840
ah, older woman, 24.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.360
Only a hundred

05:20.880 --> 05:23.360
or so meters away

05:20.880 --> 05:23.360
from us, Rachel!

05:24.200 --> 05:25.280
That's mom!

05:25.320 --> 05:27.240
I flicked right.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.240
These treacherous eyes!

05:27.280 --> 05:29.960
Dylan, are you trying

05:27.280 --> 05:29.960
to hook up with me

05:27.280 --> 05:29.960
on Love Swipe?

05:30.000 --> 05:32.800
Your photo's 3 years old.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.800
You look completely different.

05:32.840 --> 05:35.640
So my face has

05:32.840 --> 05:35.640
completely changed

05:32.840 --> 05:35.640
in three years has it?

05:35.680 --> 05:38.600
Mom, you didn't say you

05:35.680 --> 05:38.600
were electronically dating.

05:38.640 --> 05:42.080
I thought I'd put

05:38.640 --> 05:42.080
myself there, see what

05:38.640 --> 05:42.080
the fuss was about.

05:42.120 --> 05:46.960
Well phew! It seems like

05:42.120 --> 05:46.960
there's been nobody on

05:42.120 --> 05:46.960
the scene since December.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.920
Yeah. How many dates

05:47.000 --> 05:48.920
you been on Rach?

05:48.960 --> 05:51.320
Well, in total, none.

05:51.360 --> 05:53.520
What?

05:51.360 --> 05:53.520
Come on, mom!

05:53.560 --> 05:54.760
Get a move on.

05:54.800 --> 05:57.040
Not going to find a man

05:54.800 --> 05:57.040
mooching about the house.

05:57.080 --> 05:59.720
Unless there are some

05:57.080 --> 05:59.720
available guys around here.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.160
And I don't

05:59.760 --> 06:01.160
know of any.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.080
Thanks, Dale.

06:11.040 --> 06:13.840
Phew!

06:11.040 --> 06:13.840
Longest day ever!

06:13.880 --> 06:15.040
Hello.

06:15.080 --> 06:16.120
[kissing]

06:16.160 --> 06:17.320
How's our little Sid?

06:17.360 --> 06:19.160
Yeah, he's good I just

06:17.360 --> 06:19.160
put him down.

06:20.360 --> 06:23.040
Well, the Briony

06:20.360 --> 06:23.040
and Tim saga continues.

06:23.080 --> 06:24.720
Who's Briony and Tim?

06:24.760 --> 06:26.600
-From work.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.600
-Ah...

06:26.640 --> 06:28.720
Don't you listen

06:26.640 --> 06:28.720
to a word I say?

06:28.760 --> 06:31.040
Of course, your voice

06:28.760 --> 06:31.040
is music to me my love.

06:31.080 --> 06:33.520
I just sometimes don't

06:31.080 --> 06:33.520
concentrate on the lyrics.

06:35.160 --> 06:38.120
So there's probably

06:35.160 --> 06:38.120
something I should tell you.

06:38.160 --> 06:39.880
It's no biggie.

06:39.920 --> 06:41.560
And certainly

06:39.920 --> 06:41.560
no one's fault.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.640
So promise me

06:41.600 --> 06:43.640
you won't overreact?

06:43.680 --> 06:46.800
I will react the exact

06:43.680 --> 06:46.800
right amount. What is it?

06:46.840 --> 06:49.320
Well, remember

06:46.840 --> 06:49.320
when Sid was born?

06:50.080 --> 06:51.600
I think I recall it,

06:50.080 --> 06:51.600
yeah.

06:51.640 --> 06:53.200
Well, it's a funny story.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.240
I ran into Jess,

06:56.280 --> 06:59.240
while we were

06:56.280 --> 06:59.240
waiting for Sid.

06:56.280 --> 06:59.240
And she...

06:59.280 --> 07:01.360
And she grabbed

06:59.280 --> 07:01.360
hold of my hand

07:01.400 --> 07:04.040
and she wouldn't let go

07:01.400 --> 07:04.040
until she'd given birth.

07:04.080 --> 07:07.720
Which explains why

07:04.080 --> 07:07.720
I was late, why I missed

07:04.080 --> 07:07.720
Sid's birth.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.400
It's silly.

07:09.440 --> 07:11.720
Like I say,

07:09.440 --> 07:11.720
it's no biggie.

07:12.400 --> 07:13.640
No biggie?

07:13.680 --> 07:15.400
No, no biggie.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.920
Is this a biggie?

07:19.960 --> 07:22.200
[Lorna]

07:19.960 --> 07:22.200
Jesus Christ,

07:19.960 --> 07:22.200
Ken! No biggie!

07:22.240 --> 07:25.280
Come on Lorn,

07:22.240 --> 07:25.280
it's not like it

07:22.240 --> 07:25.280
didn't work all right!

07:25.320 --> 07:27.880
Sid's great. And you're

07:25.320 --> 07:27.880
the best wife a man ever--

07:27.920 --> 07:29.320
Oh, shut your face!

07:29.360 --> 07:31.840
You have no idea

07:29.360 --> 07:31.840
what I was going through,

07:31.880 --> 07:34.720
what it takes to push

07:31.880 --> 07:34.720
a thing like that

07:31.880 --> 07:34.720
out of your bits.

07:34.760 --> 07:37.000
May I remind you

07:34.760 --> 07:37.000
I have seen it

07:34.760 --> 07:37.000
three times

07:37.040 --> 07:39.320
actually with

07:37.040 --> 07:39.320
two different...

07:39.360 --> 07:42.680
Oh, shit.

07:39.360 --> 07:42.680
Lorna, it wasn't

07:39.360 --> 07:42.680
my fault!

07:42.720 --> 07:44.760
Oh, it never is your

07:42.720 --> 07:44.760
fault is it, Ken?

07:44.800 --> 07:46.440
Whoops,

07:44.800 --> 07:46.440
I shot the cat.

07:46.480 --> 07:48.680
Whoops, I didn't

07:46.480 --> 07:48.680
have a vasectomy.

07:49.520 --> 07:51.040
Guys. What's happening?

07:51.080 --> 07:53.440
Are Chief Ken and Lorna

07:51.080 --> 07:53.440
going to get a divorce?

07:53.480 --> 07:55.440
No, this happens

07:53.480 --> 07:55.440
every couple of years.

07:55.480 --> 07:57.560
It's worse when

07:55.480 --> 07:57.560
they make up.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.960
Dad walking round like he's

07:57.600 --> 08:00.960
John Mayer just because he's

07:57.600 --> 08:00.960
done it twice in a week.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.320
How's your robot

08:02.400 --> 08:04.320
phone dating going?

08:04.360 --> 08:06.200
Love Swipe is crammed

08:04.360 --> 08:06.200
with goons.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.480
Well, I hope you'll give

08:06.240 --> 08:09.480
'em a chance,

08:06.240 --> 08:09.480
little miss fussy!

08:09.520 --> 08:12.800
Do you? All right,

08:09.520 --> 08:12.800
well how about him?

08:12.840 --> 08:14.120
He's quite attractive.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.600
Maybe I should go round

08:14.160 --> 08:16.600
to his and have wild sex.

08:16.640 --> 08:18.360
Be all right

08:16.640 --> 08:18.360
with that,

08:16.640 --> 08:18.360
would you?

08:18.400 --> 08:21.480
-Absolutely doodle dandy.

08:18.400 --> 08:21.480
-Absolutely doodle dandy

08:18.400 --> 08:21.480
Right.

08:21.520 --> 08:23.400
-There a match.

08:21.520 --> 08:23.400
-What?

08:23.440 --> 08:26.160
And he wants

08:23.440 --> 08:26.160
to meet now.

08:26.200 --> 08:29.120
I'll just go over

08:26.200 --> 08:29.120
there shall I?

08:29.160 --> 08:31.840
Unless anyone has

08:29.160 --> 08:31.840
any objections to that?

08:31.880 --> 08:33.680
-No, none here.

08:31.880 --> 08:33.680
-Okay.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.640
See you in the morning

08:33.720 --> 08:36.640
then. Or not!

08:37.280 --> 08:38.280
Okay.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.440
I could not be

08:42.600 --> 08:44.440
happier for her.

08:49.240 --> 08:51.160
Maybe we should

08:49.240 --> 08:51.160
get a Super King Size,

08:51.200 --> 08:54.680
that way you can be

08:51.200 --> 08:54.680
even further away

08:51.200 --> 08:54.680
and even more ridiculous.

08:54.720 --> 08:57.240
Just more comfortable

08:54.720 --> 08:57.240
like this.

08:57.280 --> 08:59.240
Lorna, I can't help

08:57.280 --> 08:59.240
what happened.

08:59.280 --> 09:00.880
I didn't mean

08:59.280 --> 09:00.880
to upset you,

09:00.920 --> 09:02.440
but what can I

09:00.920 --> 09:02.440
do about it?

09:02.480 --> 09:05.560
Well, here's an idea,

09:02.480 --> 09:05.560
you can stop

09:02.480 --> 09:05.560
meeting up with Jess.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.040
-[chuckles] Not happening.

09:05.600 --> 09:08.040
-Okay.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.200
If you don't care

09:08.080 --> 09:10.200
about my feelings...

09:10.240 --> 09:12.400
What about my feelings,

09:10.240 --> 09:12.400
Lorna?

09:12.440 --> 09:15.920
Jess, runs the mom's group,

09:12.440 --> 09:15.920
which happens to be my

09:12.440 --> 09:15.920
entire social life.

09:15.960 --> 09:18.640
No, sorry, you don't

09:15.960 --> 09:18.640
get to veto my friends.

09:18.680 --> 09:21.840
Friends? As if!

09:18.680 --> 09:21.840
She's after you!

09:21.880 --> 09:24.480
What? That's ridiculous!

09:24.520 --> 09:27.480
"Oh, Ken what a fascinating

09:24.520 --> 09:27.480
intellect, Ken."

09:27.520 --> 09:30.520
"Oh Ken, hold my hand

09:27.520 --> 09:30.520
while I give birth, Ken."

09:30.560 --> 09:34.200
Lorna, get real!

09:30.560 --> 09:34.200
I'm greying,

09:30.560 --> 09:34.200
I'm out of shape,

09:34.240 --> 09:36.680
Jess is a young

09:34.240 --> 09:36.680
and highly attrac...

09:36.720 --> 09:38.240
Fuck! I didn't

09:36.720 --> 09:38.240
mean that!

09:40.480 --> 09:42.160
No, I'm sorry.

09:42.200 --> 09:45.080
There is a point of principle

09:42.200 --> 09:45.080
here. I am not backing down

09:42.200 --> 09:45.080
on this.

09:45.120 --> 09:46.120
Final word.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.160
[grunts]

09:49.840 --> 09:52.600
Okay, okay,

09:49.840 --> 09:52.600
you win!

09:52.640 --> 09:55.880
I won't see Jess.

09:52.640 --> 09:55.880
I surrender my dignity

09:52.640 --> 09:55.880
at your whim.

09:55.920 --> 09:58.080
Nice to see the patriarchy

09:55.920 --> 09:58.080
at work again.

09:58.120 --> 09:59.600
How I love to

09:58.120 --> 09:59.600
rule the world.

09:59.640 --> 10:02.440
Now, will you please

09:59.640 --> 10:02.440
come back to

09:59.640 --> 10:02.440
the center of the bed!

10:02.480 --> 10:04.400
Don't know what

10:02.480 --> 10:04.400
you're going on about.

10:04.440 --> 10:05.880
[screams]

10:05.920 --> 10:08.640
Right I am getting

10:05.920 --> 10:08.640
a glass of water.

10:27.520 --> 10:30.160
-Hello?

10:27.520 --> 10:30.160
-Hey, how's it kicking?

10:30.200 --> 10:33.800
You must be Rachel's

10:30.200 --> 10:33.800
ancient housemate?

10:33.840 --> 10:35.800
-I'm her father.

10:33.840 --> 10:35.800
-Her father?

10:35.840 --> 10:38.400
Okay, well, I'm Freddy,

10:35.840 --> 10:38.400
I'm a new friend of hers.

10:38.440 --> 10:42.440
We met last night,

10:38.440 --> 10:42.440
and then we had a sleepover.

10:43.880 --> 10:45.760
Is this awkward?

10:43.880 --> 10:45.760
This feels awkward.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.480
-Let us eat our

10:45.800 --> 10:48.480
breakfast in silence.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.480
-Yeah.

10:48.520 --> 10:50.480
-Hello.

10:48.520 --> 10:50.480
-Ah, this is Freddy.

10:50.520 --> 10:52.720
Freddy and Rachel

10:50.520 --> 10:52.720
went on a date last night.

10:52.760 --> 10:54.280
Interesting.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.720
Did he hold hands with

10:54.320 --> 10:56.720
another woman while

10:54.320 --> 10:56.720
she gave birth?

10:56.760 --> 10:59.080
Oh. Seamless segueway!

10:59.120 --> 11:01.520
And thank you for airing

10:59.120 --> 11:01.520
our personal grievances

11:01.560 --> 11:03.720
in front of our daughter's

11:01.560 --> 11:03.720
one night stand.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.320
I'm not a

11:03.760 --> 11:05.320
one night stand guy.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.600
You're boyfriend

11:05.360 --> 11:07.600
and girlfriend,

11:05.360 --> 11:07.600
from now on?

11:07.640 --> 11:09.920
-I mean, I'm not in that place--

11:07.640 --> 11:09.920
-Thank you

11:09.960 --> 11:11.840
Shit! Rachel actually

11:09.960 --> 11:11.840
got laid!

11:11.880 --> 11:15.000
[laughing]

11:15.040 --> 11:17.840
-You're still here?

11:15.040 --> 11:17.840
-Well, it's breakfast...

11:17.880 --> 11:19.920
Most important

11:17.880 --> 11:19.920
meal of the day.

11:19.960 --> 11:21.760
Good morning

11:19.960 --> 11:21.760
my beautiful family!

11:23.640 --> 11:26.960
And complete stranger,

11:23.640 --> 11:26.960
would you like

11:23.640 --> 11:26.960
some pancakes?

11:27.000 --> 11:28.480
That's what I'm

11:27.000 --> 11:28.480
talking about.

11:29.840 --> 11:32.480
You must be

11:29.840 --> 11:32.480
a friend of Rachel's?

11:32.520 --> 11:37.280
Sort of.

11:32.520 --> 11:37.280
We met last night.

11:32.520 --> 11:37.280
On a date.

11:37.320 --> 11:40.280
Oh, fun. Did you stay

11:37.320 --> 11:40.280
the night here?

11:40.320 --> 11:42.320
-Yeah.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.320
-With Rachel?

11:42.360 --> 11:43.880
Yes.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.520
-In her bedroom?

11:43.920 --> 11:46.520
-Yes, Dale, we

11:43.920 --> 11:46.520
slept together okay.

11:46.560 --> 11:47.640
[thumps]

11:47.680 --> 11:48.520
[screams]

11:48.960 --> 11:50.720
Dale!

11:50.760 --> 11:53.240
I am so sorry,

11:50.760 --> 11:53.240
I'll get him

11:50.760 --> 11:53.240
cleaned up in no time.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.520
What the hell was that?

11:54.560 --> 11:57.360
Weird right! It must be

11:54.560 --> 11:57.360
my training with Mr. Xi.

11:57.400 --> 12:00.760
I get these crazy

11:57.400 --> 12:00.760
reflex reactions.

11:57.400 --> 12:00.760
I think he'll be okay.

12:00.800 --> 12:03.120
Dale, you told me

12:00.800 --> 12:03.120
to start dating again!

12:03.160 --> 12:04.200
You should.

12:04.240 --> 12:06.200
Why punch the guy

12:04.240 --> 12:06.200
I spend the night with?

12:06.240 --> 12:07.360
I thought you...

12:07.400 --> 12:09.240
I mean, we made it

12:07.400 --> 12:09.240
very clear.

12:09.280 --> 12:12.240
-There's nothing between us.

12:09.280 --> 12:12.240
-Yeah. What are you saying?

12:12.280 --> 12:14.640
You were jealous.

12:12.280 --> 12:14.640
Of me and him.

12:14.680 --> 12:18.360
What! I love Ling.

12:14.680 --> 12:18.360
See previous conversations.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.320
There're suppressed

12:18.400 --> 12:20.320
emotions here.

12:20.360 --> 12:22.200
Maybe deal

12:20.360 --> 12:22.200
with them, Dale.

12:22.240 --> 12:25.760
I can't have this jealous

12:22.240 --> 12:25.760
ex saying he's not jealous

12:22.240 --> 12:25.760
when he so clearly is.

12:26.760 --> 12:29.480
And I don't care

12:26.760 --> 12:29.480
either way... So!

12:33.920 --> 12:38.400
[yoga teacher] We're going to

12:33.920 --> 12:38.400
take our arms into the air,

12:33.920 --> 12:38.400
stretching to the side.

12:38.440 --> 12:39.440
Rachel is so wrong.

12:40.160 --> 12:43.640
Me? Jealous?

12:40.160 --> 12:43.640
No way.

12:43.680 --> 12:47.400
Sure, once I thought her

12:43.680 --> 12:47.400
to be my one and only

12:43.680 --> 12:47.400
eternal love.

12:47.440 --> 12:49.480
But that was so

12:47.440 --> 12:49.480
eight months ago.

12:49.520 --> 12:53.320
Right leg in the air.

12:49.520 --> 12:53.320
Really push into that stretch.

12:53.360 --> 12:55.120
What do you think,

12:53.360 --> 12:55.120
Chief Ken?

12:57.240 --> 12:59.840
-Chief.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.840
-Yeah, can we talk

12:57.240 --> 12:59.840
about this another time.

12:59.880 --> 13:00.880
[Jess]

12:59.880 --> 13:00.880
Hey.

13:02.360 --> 13:05.120
Oh, no.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.680
Right as soon as this

13:05.160 --> 13:07.680
class finishes

13:05.160 --> 13:07.680
we are leaving.

13:09.600 --> 13:12.440
Keep walking, Dale.

13:09.600 --> 13:12.440
Just keep walking.

13:12.480 --> 13:15.480
Ken! Ken! Ken!

13:17.600 --> 13:21.000
Wow, that is some

13:17.600 --> 13:21.000
world class baby

13:17.600 --> 13:21.000
yoga leaving there.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.120
[laughs]

13:21.040 --> 13:22.120
Right.

13:22.160 --> 13:24.640
It was great to

13:22.160 --> 13:24.640
see you anyway, Jess.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.440
-Bye, now.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.440
-Hey, what are you guys

13:24.680 --> 13:27.440
up to this afternoon?

13:27.480 --> 13:29.200
Some of the moms

13:27.480 --> 13:29.200
are coming over.

13:29.240 --> 13:31.360
I've made a killer

13:29.240 --> 13:31.360
pistachio tart.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.120
Oh, that sounds delicious!

13:33.160 --> 13:35.200
We have absolutely

13:33.160 --> 13:35.200
nothing going on!

13:35.240 --> 13:38.200
Oh, but I'm afraid we do

13:35.240 --> 13:38.200
have something going on,

13:35.240 --> 13:38.200
don't we.

13:38.240 --> 13:39.600
We've got that

13:38.240 --> 13:39.600
thing, Dale.

13:39.640 --> 13:41.480
You know that

13:39.640 --> 13:41.480
thing we've got.

13:44.200 --> 13:46.400
Oh, I get you,

13:44.200 --> 13:46.400
that thing!

13:46.440 --> 13:47.760
[laughing]

13:46.440 --> 13:47.760
He will just...

13:47.800 --> 13:50.600
No, Chief Ken,

13:47.800 --> 13:50.600
that thing is next

13:47.800 --> 13:50.600
Wednesday.

13:50.640 --> 13:52.360
This afternoon

13:50.640 --> 13:52.360
is completely free.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.120
Great! Well,

13:52.400 --> 13:54.120
come round.

13:54.160 --> 13:55.920
Oh, but I'm sorry,

13:54.160 --> 13:55.920
we can't.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.320
Get in. Bye.

13:57.360 --> 13:59.880
Which way you headed?

13:59.920 --> 14:01.400
Through town.

13:59.920 --> 14:01.400
See you.

14:01.440 --> 14:04.480
You couldn't give me

14:01.440 --> 14:04.480
a lift, could you?

14:01.440 --> 14:04.480
It's just,

14:04.520 --> 14:07.760
bit worried about Eliza,

14:04.520 --> 14:07.760
it's such a hot day

14:07.800 --> 14:11.720
and the sun being

14:07.800 --> 14:11.720
so dangerous

14:07.800 --> 14:11.720
for tiny babies.

14:11.760 --> 14:13.640
It's very hot.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.960
-[sighs] Of course.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.960
-Great.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.480
Oh, isn't he

14:16.000 --> 14:18.480
a nice man.

14:18.520 --> 14:21.640
[exhales]

14:18.520 --> 14:21.640
Right. We're dropping her

14:18.520 --> 14:21.640
straight off to her house.

14:21.680 --> 14:24.720
And you do not

14:21.680 --> 14:24.720
mention this to Lorna.

14:21.680 --> 14:24.720
Do you understand?

14:29.320 --> 14:32.160
Sure I can't

14:29.320 --> 14:32.160
tempt you in?

14:32.200 --> 14:33.760
The girls will be

14:32.200 --> 14:33.760
round soon.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.720
Got some eclairs

14:33.800 --> 14:35.720
in from Druckers.

14:35.760 --> 14:39.120
-Oh...

14:35.760 --> 14:39.120
-No, can't do it.

14:39.160 --> 14:42.280
Suit yourself. Dale,

14:39.160 --> 14:42.280
would you be a sweetheart?

14:42.320 --> 14:43.120
Of course.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.200
-Bye.

14:49.720 --> 14:52.000
-Thank you.

14:49.720 --> 14:52.000
-Chief Ken,

14:52.040 --> 14:53.600
have you gone insane?

14:53.640 --> 14:56.160
That's some of the finest

14:53.640 --> 14:56.160
Vienna patisserie

14:53.640 --> 14:56.160
in Birmingham.

14:56.200 --> 14:58.200
Lorna says I'm not

14:56.200 --> 14:58.200
allowed to see Jess.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.640
She's jealous.

14:59.680 --> 15:01.680
But mom's group

14:59.680 --> 15:01.680
is the most fun

14:59.680 --> 15:01.680
we have all week.

15:03.480 --> 15:05.840
Hey, where are

15:03.480 --> 15:05.840
you going?

15:05.880 --> 15:08.000
Lorna didn't say I can't

15:05.880 --> 15:08.000
see Jess did she?

15:08.040 --> 15:09.480
-Well, no.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.480
-Okay.

15:09.520 --> 15:12.320
I'm gonna go have some cake

15:09.520 --> 15:12.320
and have the best time ever.

15:12.360 --> 15:13.200
Traitor!

15:14.800 --> 15:15.760
[sighs]

15:17.320 --> 15:18.760
What do you

15:17.320 --> 15:18.760
think, Sid?

15:18.800 --> 15:21.160
It's not like I'm doing

15:18.800 --> 15:21.160
anything wrong, is it.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.160
Jess is my friend,

15:21.200 --> 15:23.160
I love mom's group.

15:24.320 --> 15:26.240
What do you think

15:24.320 --> 15:26.240
my boy?

15:26.280 --> 15:28.200
Should I obey

15:26.280 --> 15:28.200
your delusional mother

15:28.240 --> 15:31.280
or should I make my

15:28.240 --> 15:31.280
own decisions in life

15:28.240 --> 15:31.280
like a proper adult?

15:32.960 --> 15:34.240
Who's the Chief here?

15:38.240 --> 15:39.400
Hello?

15:43.280 --> 15:45.960
Great! You changed

15:43.280 --> 15:45.960
your mind!

15:46.000 --> 15:47.040
[giggles]

15:47.080 --> 15:49.160
Yep, when are the girls

15:47.080 --> 15:49.160
getting here?

15:49.200 --> 15:51.440
Oh, don't know

15:49.200 --> 15:51.440
in about an hour or so.

15:51.480 --> 15:53.440
Dale, would you

15:51.480 --> 15:53.440
be a love,

15:53.480 --> 15:56.280
and run and get some

15:53.480 --> 15:56.280
of that nice coffee from town.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.000
I invite everyone

15:56.320 --> 15:58.000
over for coffee

15:58.040 --> 16:00.840
What do I forget

15:58.040 --> 16:00.840
to buy? Coffee!

16:00.880 --> 16:02.320
Yeah, I'll be

16:00.880 --> 16:02.320
back soon!

16:03.080 --> 16:04.240
Right.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.960
You make yourself

16:05.600 --> 16:07.960
comfortable.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.960
Back in a sec.

16:12.320 --> 16:13.880
There we are, Sidney.

16:24.360 --> 16:25.920
[breathes]

16:30.640 --> 16:32.200
There you go.

16:33.280 --> 16:34.400
Wine?

16:34.440 --> 16:37.280
Well, there's no

16:34.440 --> 16:37.280
coffee is there!

16:34.440 --> 16:37.280
[laughing]

16:37.320 --> 16:39.240
All right then.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.240
Shower for me.

16:39.720 --> 16:41.080
Sorry, shower?

16:41.120 --> 16:43.920
Well I can't receive

16:41.120 --> 16:43.920
the girls in yoga sweats,

16:41.120 --> 16:43.920
can I?

16:43.960 --> 16:45.120
Okay, Jess.

16:45.160 --> 16:47.120
Should I go

16:45.160 --> 16:47.120
and come back

16:45.160 --> 16:47.120
another time?

16:47.160 --> 16:48.880
Oh no,

16:47.160 --> 16:48.880
I'll be two ticks.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.800
Don't worry, we've got

16:48.920 --> 16:51.800
a couple of hours before

16:48.920 --> 16:51.800
the gang get here.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.080
A couple of hours?

16:56.600 --> 16:57.680
[sighs]

17:08.080 --> 17:09.320
What are you doing?

17:15.280 --> 17:18.720
Ken, oh, you're

17:15.280 --> 17:18.720
not leaving are you?

17:18.760 --> 17:21.600
Shouldn't you be

17:18.760 --> 17:21.600
wearing more clothes?

17:21.640 --> 17:24.080
Why are you walking

17:21.640 --> 17:24.080
towards me?

17:21.640 --> 17:24.080
What's happening?

17:24.120 --> 17:28.400
What's happening is you

17:24.120 --> 17:28.400
are going to ravish me,

17:28.440 --> 17:31.280
you sexy giant old man you.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.920
What? There will be

17:31.320 --> 17:33.920
no ravishing!

17:33.960 --> 17:35.320
Not today or tomorrow.

17:35.360 --> 17:37.760
You were suppose to be

17:35.360 --> 17:37.760
my coffee morning friend.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.600
I'm very disappointed

17:37.800 --> 17:39.600
in you, Jess.

17:39.640 --> 17:41.080
I know you're

17:39.640 --> 17:41.080
tempted.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.720
You are scaring me.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.720
I'm a happily married man.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.160
What about Marc?

17:45.200 --> 17:47.440
Oh, come on,

17:45.200 --> 17:47.440
we both know

17:45.200 --> 17:47.440
there's no Marc.

17:47.920 --> 17:50.200
What?

17:50.240 --> 17:53.080
What? Don't undo that.

17:50.240 --> 17:53.080
Why are you undoing that?

17:53.120 --> 17:54.400
You are mental!

17:54.440 --> 17:57.840
I'm mental

17:54.440 --> 17:57.840
and naked.

17:57.880 --> 18:01.000
I'm not looking.

17:57.880 --> 18:01.000
And I'm leaving!

18:01.040 --> 18:03.600
And I'm not looking!

18:01.040 --> 18:03.600
Goodbye!

18:07.760 --> 18:09.960
-Get in the car.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.960
-Why? I got coffee?

18:10.000 --> 18:11.560
She's a fucking nutter.

18:19.920 --> 18:23.040
So, Lorna was right.

18:19.920 --> 18:23.040
Jess was after you.

18:23.080 --> 18:26.280
Yes. But Lorna has

18:23.080 --> 18:26.280
no right to try

18:23.080 --> 18:26.280
and control my life.

18:26.320 --> 18:28.760
I've behaved entirely

18:26.320 --> 18:28.760
faultlessly, yet somehow

18:28.800 --> 18:30.560
I'm also massively

18:28.800 --> 18:30.560
in the wrong.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.400
I should be the one

18:30.600 --> 18:32.400
to tell Lorna.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.840
No! Obviously we're

18:32.440 --> 18:34.840
not going to tell her.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.520
And you,

18:37.920 --> 18:40.520
my ex-friend,

18:37.920 --> 18:40.520
can bog off.

18:40.560 --> 18:42.000
Right. Inside.

18:42.040 --> 18:44.800
And none of that accidental

18:42.040 --> 18:44.800
truth-telling that you do.

18:44.840 --> 18:48.160
No, I've shaken that

18:44.840 --> 18:48.160
out my system. It's

18:44.840 --> 18:48.160
hard to do business.

18:48.200 --> 18:50.800
-Crime.

18:48.200 --> 18:50.800
-In China, without

18:48.200 --> 18:50.800
the odd porky pie.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.800
I'll stick to my

18:50.840 --> 18:52.800
old standby.

18:52.840 --> 18:57.240
We were in the market

18:52.840 --> 18:57.240
shopping for Lotus dumplings

18:52.840 --> 18:57.240
for the dragon boat festival.

18:57.280 --> 19:00.320
Or maybe just go to

18:57.280 --> 19:00.320
your room and never

18:57.280 --> 19:00.320
talk to Lorna again.

19:00.360 --> 19:01.440
-Okay.

19:07.040 --> 19:09.560
Oh, hi,

19:07.040 --> 19:09.560
you two.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.160
-Hello, beautiful.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.160
-You had a good day?

19:12.200 --> 19:14.520
Yeah.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.520
He's asleep.

19:19.920 --> 19:22.160
-Sorry, we argued.

19:19.920 --> 19:22.160
-Me, too.

19:22.200 --> 19:25.520
Maybe I was being

19:22.200 --> 19:25.520
over-sensitive about Jess.

19:25.560 --> 19:28.000
Well, still, I probably

19:25.560 --> 19:28.000
shouldn't see her again.

19:28.040 --> 19:30.080
Oh you're not bloody

19:28.040 --> 19:30.080
seeing her again.

19:30.120 --> 19:32.760
-Are you seeing her again?

19:30.120 --> 19:32.760
-No! Of course not.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.680
I appreciate it, love.

19:36.480 --> 19:37.840
Oh fuck,

19:36.480 --> 19:37.840
it's started.

19:39.080 --> 19:40.040
[kissing]

19:41.600 --> 19:44.360
So, maybe we

19:41.600 --> 19:44.360
could put on a box set.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.240
A bit of Ken

19:44.400 --> 19:46.240
and Lorna time.

19:46.280 --> 19:48.760
Yes, that's my favorite

19:46.280 --> 19:48.760
kind of time.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.840
Has it ever

20:02.960 --> 20:04.840
occurred to you

20:04.880 --> 20:08.200
that I'm like a faithful,

20:04.880 --> 20:08.200
non-alcoholic Don Draper?

20:08.240 --> 20:10.400
-You totally are.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.400
-I am right.

20:12.440 --> 20:14.320
Yeah. Five to go

20:12.440 --> 20:14.320
to finish the Season.

20:15.400 --> 20:16.840
[baby fussing]

20:18.240 --> 20:20.000
-I'll go.

20:18.240 --> 20:20.000
-You sit down.

20:20.040 --> 20:23.360
Draper's gonna

20:20.040 --> 20:23.360
change that nappy.

20:20.040 --> 20:23.360
God, I am like him.

20:30.160 --> 20:31.840
Well then, Sidney.

20:31.880 --> 20:36.000
No in-depth analysis

20:31.880 --> 20:36.000
of the Arab Israeli

20:31.880 --> 20:36.000
conflict for us tonight.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.200
No, we shall

20:37.000 --> 20:39.200
change that nappy.

20:39.240 --> 20:41.800
A quick bath,

20:39.240 --> 20:41.800
and then bed.

20:39.240 --> 20:41.800
Deal? Oh!

20:44.720 --> 20:47.200
Here I'll do that.

20:44.720 --> 20:47.200
You take the weight off.

20:47.240 --> 20:48.560
No, you're all right.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.960
Ken, honestly.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.960
It's my turn,

20:48.600 --> 20:50.960
you go and relax.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.120
I don't want to relax.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.120
You go and relax.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.480
-Let me change him.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.480
-Lorna.

20:55.520 --> 20:58.640
You are stressed out

20:55.520 --> 20:58.640
and it's ruining

20:55.520 --> 20:58.640
our family life okay?

20:58.680 --> 21:01.720
Now get in there

20:58.680 --> 21:01.720
and chill the fuck out,

20:58.680 --> 21:01.720
yeah?

21:01.760 --> 21:04.000
Oh, okay, I'll go

21:01.760 --> 21:04.000
and make

21:01.760 --> 21:04.000
a cup of tea then.

21:04.040 --> 21:05.960
Right good.

21:04.040 --> 21:05.960
Tea would be nice.

21:10.160 --> 21:14.840
No, no, no,

21:10.160 --> 21:14.840
no, oh fuck.

21:14.880 --> 21:17.720
Just gonna take him

21:14.880 --> 21:17.720
for a little drive.

21:14.880 --> 21:17.720
Sooth him a bit.

21:17.760 --> 21:19.520
But he's not crying.

21:19.560 --> 21:22.200
He's upset though I can tell.

21:19.560 --> 21:22.200
It's a sort of primary

21:19.560 --> 21:22.200
carer thing.

21:23.440 --> 21:25.200
[phone ringing]

21:28.960 --> 21:30.800
<i>Ken! I've been</i>

21:28.960 --> 21:30.800
<i>calling and calling!</i>

21:30.840 --> 21:32.840
<i>Where is my baby?</i>

21:30.840 --> 21:32.840
<i>I want my baby back!</i>

21:32.880 --> 21:36.120
I'm driving her over now.

21:32.880 --> 21:36.120
Don't move! I'll be

21:32.880 --> 21:36.120
ten minutes tops.

21:42.400 --> 21:45.000
Might as well

21:42.400 --> 21:45.000
keep you company.

21:45.040 --> 21:47.040
But let's make it

21:45.040 --> 21:47.040
a short ride.

21:47.080 --> 21:49.080
-How's our Siddles?

21:47.080 --> 21:49.080
-He's very close

21:49.120 --> 21:50.800
to being upset.

21:50.840 --> 21:52.840
Just gonna get something

21:50.840 --> 21:52.840
from the house.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.400
What am I going

21:55.080 --> 21:56.400
to do Dale?

21:56.440 --> 21:57.600
Snap out of it, Ken!

21:57.640 --> 21:59.480
She's in the car!

21:59.520 --> 22:03.800
Now, you listen to me.

21:59.520 --> 22:03.800
I've done swaps like these

21:59.520 --> 22:03.800
with Mr. Xi all right.

22:03.840 --> 22:07.000
Then with suitcases of money!

22:03.840 --> 22:07.000
Now it's babies.

22:03.840 --> 22:07.000
Same principle.

22:07.040 --> 22:08.760
-What?

22:07.040 --> 22:08.760
-I run to Jess's house.

22:08.800 --> 22:12.800
Grab Sid.

22:08.800 --> 22:12.800
You take her baby

22:08.800 --> 22:12.800
to the Leisure Center carpark

22:12.840 --> 22:16.480
that's where we'll meet.

22:12.840 --> 22:16.480
All you got to do

22:12.840 --> 22:16.480
is keep Lorna...

22:16.520 --> 22:18.560
[both]

22:16.520 --> 22:18.560
From looking

22:16.520 --> 22:18.560
at the baby.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.120
-You got this

22:18.600 --> 22:20.120
-I can do this.

22:20.160 --> 22:22.800
-You got this, Chief Ken!

22:20.160 --> 22:22.800
-I can swap these babies!

22:22.840 --> 22:25.080
-I know you can, yes!

22:22.840 --> 22:25.080
-Yeah!

22:25.120 --> 22:26.960
-Dale!

22:25.120 --> 22:26.960
-For luck.

22:33.800 --> 22:36.320
Where's my baby?

22:33.800 --> 22:36.320
Give me my baby now!

22:36.360 --> 22:39.000
Jessica, we're gonna

22:36.360 --> 22:39.000
get your baby.

22:36.360 --> 22:39.000
Just stay calm.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.720
Also, here's your

22:39.040 --> 22:41.720
coffee from earlier.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.800
-Fuck the coffee.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.800
-Let's go.

22:54.640 --> 22:55.720
This is nice.

22:58.240 --> 23:00.120
Okay, I'm bored now

22:58.240 --> 23:00.120
let's go home.

23:00.160 --> 23:03.840
Lorna! I'm loving this.

23:00.160 --> 23:03.840
Come on, let's chat.

23:03.880 --> 23:07.960
Tell me about those guys

23:03.880 --> 23:07.960
at work, you know,

23:03.880 --> 23:07.960
old Tom and Britney.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.200
-Briony and Tim.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.200
-Hell yes. Those guys.

23:10.240 --> 23:13.600
Well, Siobhan thought she

23:10.240 --> 23:13.600
wasn't invited to

23:10.240 --> 23:13.600
the Christmas party...

23:13.640 --> 23:15.360
-No.

23:13.640 --> 23:15.360
-I mean she's very nice,

23:15.400 --> 23:18.280
in her fifties.

23:15.400 --> 23:18.280
She lives on her own,

23:18.320 --> 23:21.640
she's a bit lonely and anyway

23:18.320 --> 23:21.640
she came in the other day

23:18.320 --> 23:21.640
to work

23:21.680 --> 23:25.600
and she burst into tears,

23:21.680 --> 23:25.600
Ken on the shop floor and...

23:30.960 --> 23:34.680
I took her down to the little

23:30.960 --> 23:34.680
room where we have our

23:30.960 --> 23:34.680
cup of tea and stuff...

23:39.680 --> 23:43.280
Anyway she had to admit that

23:39.680 --> 23:43.280
she hadn't even opened

23:39.680 --> 23:43.280
the envelope!

23:43.320 --> 23:44.440
But I'm blathering...

23:46.600 --> 23:49.320
What? I live for this shit.

23:46.600 --> 23:49.320
Lorna, please...

23:49.360 --> 23:52.080
Okay, well, Briony came in

23:49.360 --> 23:52.080
the following day...

23:53.760 --> 23:56.720
And directly said,

23:53.760 --> 23:56.720
I'll go and get...

23:58.880 --> 24:00.520
Aw... Probably

23:58.880 --> 24:00.520
wants his bottle.

24:00.560 --> 24:02.400
What no! Where

24:00.560 --> 24:02.400
are you going?

24:02.440 --> 24:04.360
Bring Sid, in the front

24:02.440 --> 24:04.360
for a cuddle.

24:04.400 --> 24:08.000
No! Lorna this is our time,

24:04.400 --> 24:08.000
just you and me. Let her cry.

24:04.400 --> 24:08.000
Let him cry.

24:08.040 --> 24:10.040
-Ken, I can't listen

24:08.040 --> 24:10.040
to him cry.

24:08.040 --> 24:10.040
-Lorna,

24:10.720 --> 24:12.040
You're so beautiful.

24:23.120 --> 24:25.760
Ken! I don't know

24:23.120 --> 24:25.760
what's got into you?

24:32.200 --> 24:33.880
Oh fuck!

24:40.640 --> 24:42.120
-Ken?

24:40.640 --> 24:42.120
-Stop.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.760
Someone's got my baby!

24:42.160 --> 24:44.760
My baby!

24:44.800 --> 24:47.360
What the hell have

24:44.800 --> 24:47.360
you done with my baby!

24:49.840 --> 24:52.920
Fuck! No!

24:52.960 --> 24:54.920
-Ken, what the hell

24:52.960 --> 24:54.920
is going on?

24:52.960 --> 24:54.920
-Move.

24:55.640 --> 24:57.440
-No!

24:55.640 --> 24:57.440
-Ken!

24:58.040 --> 25:00.000
Ken!

25:00.040 --> 25:01.800
What the hell

25:00.040 --> 25:01.800
are you doing?

25:01.840 --> 25:03.320
So sorry, sir!

25:01.840 --> 25:03.320
I can explain.

25:03.360 --> 25:06.080
-You've got a baby

25:03.360 --> 25:06.080
in the back of your car.

25:03.360 --> 25:06.080
-I don't!

25:06.120 --> 25:08.640
-Dale put it in.

25:06.120 --> 25:08.640
-Hi. I'm Dale.

25:08.680 --> 25:11.640
Oh, thank God,

25:08.680 --> 25:11.640
my little girl.

25:15.400 --> 25:19.400
And don't you dare bring

25:15.400 --> 25:19.400
your stodgy sponge to my

25:15.400 --> 25:19.400
mom's group ever again!

25:20.880 --> 25:24.080
How dare you. That sponge

25:20.880 --> 25:24.080
was light as a feather!

25:25.320 --> 25:26.960
What the hell

25:25.320 --> 25:26.960
is happening?

25:27.000 --> 25:29.880
Going around putting babies

25:27.000 --> 25:29.880
in people's cars.

25:27.000 --> 25:29.880
That is not on!

25:29.920 --> 25:32.280
-Just calm down,

25:29.920 --> 25:32.280
I can explain.

25:29.920 --> 25:32.280
-You will, Ken.

25:32.320 --> 25:34.320
I went round to Jess'

25:32.320 --> 25:34.320
this afternoon...

25:34.360 --> 25:36.720
-Ken!

25:34.360 --> 25:36.720
-I know you

25:34.360 --> 25:36.720
told me not to.

25:36.760 --> 25:37.880
I didn't.

25:37.920 --> 25:39.880
Okay, this is principally

25:37.920 --> 25:39.880
for Lorna.

25:39.920 --> 25:41.640
-Who's Lorna?

25:39.920 --> 25:41.640
-My wife.

25:43.160 --> 25:46.440
Jess was there,

25:43.160 --> 25:46.440
and I had Sid and Eliza,

25:43.160 --> 25:46.440
and I...

25:46.480 --> 25:49.720
No, no, mate, listen

25:46.480 --> 25:49.720
I am way behind here.

25:49.760 --> 25:52.200
I'm sorry Lorn,

25:49.760 --> 25:52.200
can we talk about

25:49.760 --> 25:52.200
this in the car?

25:52.240 --> 25:54.880
Yes, I think we better

25:52.240 --> 25:54.880
get back to your son, Ken.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.240
All I'm saying, Ken,

26:07.000 --> 26:09.240
is I was right.

26:09.280 --> 26:11.040
That mad bitch

26:09.280 --> 26:11.040
did fancy you.

26:11.080 --> 26:12.640
Yes, all right,

26:11.080 --> 26:12.640
you were right.

26:12.680 --> 26:15.680
In future, I will remember

26:12.680 --> 26:15.680
I'm irresistible to all women.

26:15.720 --> 26:18.120
It's their incredibly

26:15.720 --> 26:18.120
well kept secret.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.160
How fast did you

26:18.160 --> 26:20.160
run out of that house?

26:20.200 --> 26:23.880
Like a fat Usain Bolt.

26:20.200 --> 26:23.880
Some wine?

26:26.440 --> 26:27.240
Rachel.

26:29.680 --> 26:33.720
Watching Ken and Lorna today

26:29.680 --> 26:33.720
has taught me how

26:29.680 --> 26:33.720
destructive jealousy can be.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.840
It seems their

26:33.760 --> 26:35.840
marriage is okay now.

26:35.880 --> 26:37.960
But it was touch

26:35.880 --> 26:37.960
and go there earlier.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.720
What are you

26:38.000 --> 26:39.720
trying to say, Dale?

26:39.760 --> 26:41.600
About this morning.

26:41.640 --> 26:46.720
I now accept that somewhere

26:41.640 --> 26:46.720
deep down I may have

26:41.640 --> 26:46.720
residual feelings for you.

26:46.760 --> 26:50.960
But, don't worry, I will not

26:46.760 --> 26:50.960
let those feelings get in

26:46.760 --> 26:50.960
the way of our friendship.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.440
I will crush them using

26:51.000 --> 26:54.440
the immense power

26:51.000 --> 26:54.440
of my mind.

26:54.480 --> 26:57.360
Okay, well, good luck

26:54.480 --> 26:57.360
with that.

26:58.840 --> 27:01.640
So, we're okay?

27:01.680 --> 27:04.040
Absolutely doodle dandy.

27:04.760 --> 27:05.960
Good.
