WEBVTT

00:09.217 --> 00:10.844
Ba-bum.

00:12.178 --> 00:13.179
[croaks]

00:14.639 --> 00:15.890
[panting]

00:17.475 --> 00:20.228
[Claudia]  Previously
on  The Dragon Prince...

00:20.937 --> 00:22.397
Well, maybe it's just a mirror.

00:22.480 --> 00:23.606
[Viren sighs]

00:23.690 --> 00:26.526
Of all the treasures, artifacts and relics

00:26.609 --> 00:28.695
in the lair
of the Dragon King and Queen...

00:28.778 --> 00:30.822
they kept this close to where they slept.

00:30.905 --> 00:32.240
It must be important.

00:33.575 --> 00:36.119
You're writing a letter... to the king?

00:36.745 --> 00:37.954
[Callum]  He'll be worried about us.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.916
It'll mean a lot to him to know
why we left and that we're doing okay.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.419
Wait. They don't know, do they?

00:44.502 --> 00:46.796
[Viren] You are to return
with the terrible news

00:46.880 --> 00:48.923
that the princes have perished.

00:49.466 --> 00:52.260
What am I supposed to do
if we find them alive?

00:52.343 --> 00:53.261
Oh...

00:53.803 --> 00:55.930
you'll know the right thing to do.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.767
[Claudia]  We'll find Callum and Ezran

00:58.850 --> 01:02.687
wherever we find that vile,
bloodthirsty elven assassin.

01:04.689 --> 01:07.067
[chanting indistinctly]

01:12.280 --> 01:13.198
There!

01:13.281 --> 01:14.866
That's where we'll find them.

01:16.534 --> 01:19.079
[ocarina playing faintly]

01:22.540 --> 01:23.541
[sighs]

01:32.509 --> 01:33.593
[ocarina continues]

01:36.888 --> 01:37.889
Do it.

01:43.728 --> 01:45.730
[theme music playing]

02:00.620 --> 02:01.955
[roaring]

02:33.611 --> 02:35.446
Go on. Do it.

02:35.530 --> 02:36.865
What are you waiting for?

02:36.948 --> 02:40.577
She's a Moonshadow elf.
And she kidnapped the princes.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.036
-You just have to--
-I know!

02:42.120 --> 02:44.956
I've just never attacked
someone who's sleeping before.

02:45.039 --> 02:47.792
It doesn't seem... sporting.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.420
You want me to wake her?

02:51.713 --> 02:55.174
And how long do you need her
to be awake for it to be sporting?

02:55.258 --> 02:56.885
Ten seconds? Five?

02:57.427 --> 03:00.096
-One second.
-Okay. On three.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.057
One... two...

03:03.141 --> 03:04.267
-[Rayla grunts]
-[Soren gasps]

03:06.060 --> 03:09.063
But how did you resist the sleep spell?

03:09.147 --> 03:13.526
Oh, I used this lovely rose
to help me stay awake. [sniffs]

03:14.068 --> 03:16.321
Hard to sleep with a thorn poking at you.

03:18.823 --> 03:20.241
[Soren grunting]

03:23.995 --> 03:26.497
Are we gonna fight,
or is this a talent show?

03:27.749 --> 03:28.708
Oh.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.464
[grunts and scoffs]

03:36.549 --> 03:37.550
[Rayla grunts]

03:43.848 --> 03:44.849
[exclaims]

03:46.643 --> 03:48.144
[both grunting]

04:03.910 --> 04:06.037
[panting] I keep telling people,

04:06.120 --> 04:09.165
"'Sweep the leg' is not a thing
in swordfighting!"

04:10.041 --> 04:11.209
[yelps]

04:11.292 --> 04:15.338
Oh, any more swordfighting lessons?
I'm eager to learn.

04:15.421 --> 04:17.715
-[Claudia] Soren!
-[Rayla gasps]

04:22.470 --> 04:24.764
[chanting indistinctly]

04:27.350 --> 04:28.351
Ahhh!

04:29.477 --> 04:31.354
Any last words, elf?

04:31.938 --> 04:35.275
-Does "hot mud" count as a word?
-What do you mean?

04:35.358 --> 04:36.359
[yelps]

04:37.443 --> 04:38.945
-[grunts]
-[Callum] Stop!

04:39.946 --> 04:42.156
-Callum?
-[Callum] Don't fight each other!

04:42.240 --> 04:43.241
You're not enemies.

04:43.324 --> 04:45.118
-Your friends tried to kill me!
-She kidnapped you!

04:45.201 --> 04:47.495
Threw mud in my face,
and some got in my mouth!

04:48.037 --> 04:51.791
Okay! Okay! Knock it off a second.
Just let me explain.

04:51.874 --> 04:53.293
First of all, Claudia and Soren,

04:53.376 --> 04:55.962
I don't know what you're doing here,
but I'm really glad to see you.

04:56.045 --> 04:58.715
Are you kidding?
They attacked me. How can you be glad--

04:58.798 --> 05:00.466
Buh-buh-buh-buhp-buhp-buhp.

05:00.550 --> 05:04.053
Yeah, they're two of my oldest friends,
and I am glad to see them.

05:04.137 --> 05:08.433
But not glad to see you trying
to murder my new friend, Rayla,

05:08.516 --> 05:10.893
-who happens to be--
-She's an elf!

05:10.977 --> 05:13.938
-But a good elf.
-What do you mean, "But a good elf"?

05:14.022 --> 05:18.026
She kidnapped you and Prince Ezran.
How can she be good?

05:18.109 --> 05:20.945
There was no kidnapping.
We went with her by choice.

05:21.696 --> 05:25.199
Listen. It's late.
Let's all just get some rest and cool off.

05:25.283 --> 05:28.328
If, in the morning, I can't convince you
that we're all on the same side here,

05:28.411 --> 05:30.371
you can fight each other then. Agreed?

05:31.706 --> 05:32.540
Fine.

05:32.623 --> 05:34.083
-Fine.
-Whatever.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.002
Guess we'll kill you in the morning.

05:36.085 --> 05:39.088
That's more like it! Come on.
I'll show you where you can stay tonight.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.173
[sighs]

05:41.841 --> 05:46.387
-That was very confident, Callum.
-Oh, yeah? Uh... I guess.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.931
[chuckles] Even though
your hair's a little messy.

05:49.599 --> 05:50.641
[both] Ugh!

06:00.193 --> 06:03.071
[Gren] Good morning. I... I assume.

06:03.696 --> 06:06.365
Come to think of it,
I have no idea what time of day it is.

06:07.158 --> 06:08.576
Good whatever-time-it-is.

06:20.797 --> 06:23.883
Today is a special day, mystery mirror.

06:24.425 --> 06:28.179
It is the day you reveal
your secrets to me.

06:33.559 --> 06:34.519
Ah!

06:38.898 --> 06:42.276
I can't believe they found us.
I hope Claudia's not mad.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.363
Last time we saw her,
you chained her to a wall.

06:45.446 --> 06:50.284
Plus, you stole her Primal Stone.
Then you broke her Primal Stone.

06:50.368 --> 06:56.916
-Yeah, yeah. But how does my hair look?
-Hmm... Well, it could be more up.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.877
Who are you trying to impress, anyway?
Claudia?

06:59.961 --> 07:04.674
[laughs] Wha! What? Wha...
Trying to impress...

07:04.757 --> 07:07.844
[stammering] Does this look more up?

07:10.721 --> 07:12.473
[Soren] I figured out what's going on,

07:12.557 --> 07:15.393
why the princes have gotten
so chummy with the elf.

07:15.476 --> 07:19.647
[sighs] Don't talk to me until I've had
my hot brown morning potion.

07:19.730 --> 07:23.109
[slurps and sighs]

07:23.192 --> 07:25.111
Okay. Go on.

07:25.194 --> 07:29.198
She must have bitten them,
and now they both have Moonshadow Madness!

07:29.282 --> 07:31.325
-What?
-It's a thing.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.035
Where did you hear about that?

07:33.578 --> 07:34.579
Camp.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.790
[laughs]

07:38.416 --> 07:41.461
Well, we need to do something.
Dad gave us a mission.

07:41.544 --> 07:44.255
-To bring the princes home.
-Right.

07:44.338 --> 07:47.175
Unless a terrible accident occurs.
Accidentally.

07:47.258 --> 07:50.219
-[Claudia] What?
-Nothing. My point is...

07:54.515 --> 07:56.767
we should stuff them in sacks!

07:56.851 --> 08:01.564
Soren! They're our friends.
We should try persuasion first.

08:01.647 --> 08:03.649
Use our words, not our muscles.

08:03.733 --> 08:07.487
So you're saying...
we need to butter them up?

08:10.031 --> 08:13.075
[gasps and laughs]

08:16.913 --> 08:18.956
Pancakes!

08:19.040 --> 08:20.374
[all cheering] Yeah!

08:21.792 --> 08:24.670
[all laughing]

08:26.130 --> 08:27.131
[sniffs]

08:28.549 --> 08:34.138
-Mmm. I have to admit, these are good.
-Impossibly fluffy, right?

08:34.222 --> 08:37.767
Mmm. How do you get them so light?

08:37.850 --> 08:39.852
[Claudia] The secret
is separating the eggs,

08:39.936 --> 08:42.522
and beating the whites
into a stiff meringue.

08:42.605 --> 08:45.358
And just a hint of Dark Magic.

08:48.319 --> 08:49.153
So...

08:49.695 --> 08:53.533
now that we know you're not kidnapped,
you guys should come back home.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.034
With the egg, of course.

08:55.576 --> 08:58.829
Egg? Eggs would go great
with these pancakes.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.666
Actually, there is no egg.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.294
What? What happened to the egg?

09:05.378 --> 09:07.380
-You'll understand in a second...
-[Zym whimpering]

09:09.465 --> 09:10.299
[Claudia gasps]

09:11.884 --> 09:12.802
[Zym whimpers]

09:12.885 --> 09:17.682
[gasps and exclaims] It's so cute!

09:21.018 --> 09:24.438
Oh! It's a baby dwagon! Hey, you--

09:25.731 --> 09:30.152
Whoa! What happened to,
"It's not an egg. It's a powerful weapon"?

09:30.736 --> 09:31.696
Still true.

09:31.779 --> 09:35.199
Someday, it could bring death
and destruction raining down on all of us.

09:35.283 --> 09:38.411
But right now, he's so widdle!

09:38.494 --> 09:39.912
Well, get a good look,

09:39.996 --> 09:43.207
because we're headed back to Xadia
to return him to his mother.

09:43.291 --> 09:46.586
Rayla's right. We can't go home yet.
The mission is too important.

09:50.881 --> 09:52.466
[Soren]  We need to butter them up...

09:52.550 --> 09:54.051
butter them up... butter them up...

09:54.135 --> 09:56.554
butter them up... butter them up...
butter them up.

09:57.179 --> 09:59.682
You all do need to come home...

10:01.851 --> 10:06.939
because the king, your dad,
really misses you.

10:15.448 --> 10:21.162
[yawns] Whoa. Did you catch
that intense look I got from the elf?

10:21.245 --> 10:22.330
I think she's into me.

10:22.413 --> 10:25.750
Ugh! She's not into you. She's onto you!

10:25.833 --> 10:30.338
Soren, their dad is dead,
and you lied about it.

10:30.421 --> 10:32.590
And they're our friends. It's wrong.

10:32.673 --> 10:36.969
[scoffs] You squash innocent creatures
to make magic pancakes.

10:38.554 --> 10:42.391
Look, I tried it your way, "using words."

10:42.475 --> 10:45.019
Maybe it's time for my way,
punching and stuff.

10:45.102 --> 10:45.936
No!

10:46.479 --> 10:49.398
Give me one more day
to convince Callum to leave with us.

10:49.482 --> 10:53.319
I'm going to rely on something
that's even stronger than muscles.

10:53.986 --> 10:57.031
Some kind of magic muscles?

10:57.990 --> 10:58.991
Trust.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.369
We can't trust them!

11:01.452 --> 11:03.079
[sighs] Look, I get it.

11:03.162 --> 11:07.124
You don't like Claudia.
She tried to kill you multiple times.

11:07.208 --> 11:10.961
But remember, until today, she thought
you were trying to hurt me and Ezran.

11:11.045 --> 11:15.132
Ugh! That's not it, Callum.
I know they're lying.

11:15.216 --> 11:17.510
I know, because...

11:17.593 --> 11:20.763
-Well, because--
-Knock-knock.

11:27.728 --> 11:31.941
So are you two, like...
Did I interrupt something?

11:32.024 --> 11:35.319
-Between you and...
-What? Me and Rayla? No!

11:35.403 --> 11:37.279
I don't think of her that way.

11:37.363 --> 11:41.992
I think of her more as... an assassin.
An, uh... An assassin friend.

11:42.076 --> 11:45.037
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, I have friends like that.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.874
-So, uh, you wanted to talk?
-Yes.

11:49.417 --> 11:52.545
I need to tell you about some things
that happened back at home.

11:52.628 --> 11:56.382
-You know, good things, bad things...
-Mmm-hmm. I broke your Primal Stone.

11:56.465 --> 11:59.051
-What?
-Sorry. I just had to get it off my chest.

11:59.135 --> 12:02.012
-But how did you--
-I smashed it. Yup.

12:02.763 --> 12:06.517
-Hmm. Well, accidents happen.
-On purpose.

12:07.768 --> 12:11.564
-I'm sure you had a good reason.
-I did! I really did.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.232
Oh! You're the best, Claudia.

12:14.733 --> 12:16.694
I know this doesn't
exactly make up for it,

12:16.777 --> 12:18.696
but I thought maybe you would let me

12:18.779 --> 12:21.657
show you around
all the magic Moon places and stuff?

12:21.740 --> 12:23.033
I would let you.

12:28.664 --> 12:32.501
-[Zym whines]
-[Ellis and Ezran giggle]

12:34.086 --> 12:35.504
[Ava barks]

12:36.547 --> 12:39.592
Ah! You can't hurt a kid, Soren.
He's just a kid.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.680
On the other hand,

12:44.763 --> 12:48.934
if there's an accident because he's
doing something dangerous and stupid,

12:49.018 --> 12:50.728
well... that's on him.

12:54.482 --> 12:55.900
[Ellis and Ezran giggle]

12:55.983 --> 12:57.193
[Soren] Hey, friends!

12:57.276 --> 13:01.447
Ez. Dragon. Wolf-girl. Wolf.

13:01.530 --> 13:04.366
-And my main glow guy right here, Bait!
-[panting]

13:04.450 --> 13:06.410
What's happening, little toad man?

13:06.952 --> 13:07.953
[Bait groans]

13:09.288 --> 13:12.541
I have an idea for something super fun,

13:12.625 --> 13:16.504
but also incredibly dangerous in which
some potential accidents may occur.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.964
But so fun! Who's in?

13:19.048 --> 13:20.382
-[Ezran] What is it?
-I'm in!

13:20.466 --> 13:23.219
I mean... [clears throat] What is it?

13:28.849 --> 13:33.729
Oh. Uh, Claudia, this is Lujanne.
She's a Moon mage, an illusionist.

13:33.812 --> 13:37.900
-Wow! Are you an illusion yourself?
-Well, no, I'm--

13:37.983 --> 13:39.818
But you feel so real!

13:39.902 --> 13:42.238
I am real.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.782
Huh, that's exactly what
an illusion would say.

13:48.744 --> 13:52.581
And just like that, she disappears.

14:08.639 --> 14:11.350
This place is amazing!

14:11.934 --> 14:14.812
[Callum] Yeah.
I wonder what all these runes do.

14:14.895 --> 14:16.939
[Claudia] They're probably
incredible spells.

14:17.523 --> 14:20.317
It's just too bad humans can't do magic
without a Primal Stone.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.402
What?

14:21.485 --> 14:22.903
[scoffs] Yeah, we can.

14:22.987 --> 14:26.782
No, I meant Primal Magic.
Not, you know, your kind of magic.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.994
Oh? My kind of magic?

14:31.245 --> 14:32.538
Dark Magic.

14:33.289 --> 14:36.333
Do you always whisper
when you're being judgmental?

14:36.417 --> 14:38.711
Sorry, I didn't mean it that way.
I just...

14:38.794 --> 14:42.548
I loved learning magic,
and I feel sad now that I can't.

14:42.631 --> 14:44.967
But you can. If you want to.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.473
I want to learn Primal Magic.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.851
But you have to be born
with that magic inside you.

14:53.934 --> 14:57.396
[chuckles] That's the great thing
about Dark Magic.

14:57.479 --> 15:00.524
You just take creatures
that are born with magic inside

15:00.608 --> 15:03.360
and squeeze it out of them.

15:06.363 --> 15:09.617
What... You're doing it again,
Prince Judgy-face!

15:10.284 --> 15:12.620
Look. Here's how I think about it.

15:13.162 --> 15:17.458
Humans weren't born with magic.
We were born with nothing.

15:17.541 --> 15:20.294
But we still found a way
to do amazing things.

15:20.377 --> 15:23.005
That's what Dark Magic
is really all about.

15:25.716 --> 15:27.760
I'm sorry. It's just not for me.

15:28.344 --> 15:29.178
[Claudia] Hmm.

15:42.149 --> 15:44.860
So you just zip across this line?

15:44.944 --> 15:49.740
Exactly.
I call it the Slidey-Sling Go-Fast Rope!

15:50.783 --> 15:52.701
-That is a good name.
-[whimpers]

15:52.785 --> 15:53.786
[peg creaking]

15:54.620 --> 15:56.372
Are you sure it's going to hold?

15:56.914 --> 15:59.375
-Zym is nervous.
-[Zym groans]

16:00.000 --> 16:01.502
I'll show you. It's fine.

16:03.671 --> 16:06.382
[laughs and exclaims]

16:10.052 --> 16:11.053
[Bait exclaims]

16:11.929 --> 16:15.057
That was the best! [echoes]

16:16.141 --> 16:19.520
Okay, Zym, this is your chance
to see what flying feels like.

16:20.437 --> 16:21.855
Yeah!

16:23.732 --> 16:25.776
Whoo!

16:25.859 --> 16:28.278
-Yeah!
-[Zym exclaims]

16:30.072 --> 16:32.241
Whoa!

16:34.326 --> 16:38.497
Zym, you didn't open your wings.
That was the whole point.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.165
-[whimpers]
-You could go again.

16:40.249 --> 16:43.252
But what if, this time, you go first?

16:46.797 --> 16:49.049
There's not much to see here,
but I thought I'd show you--

16:49.133 --> 16:53.846
-Ruins! I love ancient ruins.
-Really? Me, too.

16:58.308 --> 17:01.520
If you close your eyes,
you can imagine what it was like.

17:01.603 --> 17:03.814
Everything so magical back then.

17:04.523 --> 17:07.067
-It's beautiful.
-[wind blowing]

17:08.610 --> 17:10.738
Yeah, beautiful.

17:11.780 --> 17:14.241
Hey. Your eyes aren't closed.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.248
[exclaims and grunts]

17:21.331 --> 17:23.167
[both laughing]

17:23.709 --> 17:26.712
You think this is great?
Wait until you see the Moon Nexus.

17:29.131 --> 17:30.174
Actually, hold on.

17:30.257 --> 17:32.551
We should come back tonight,
after the moon rises.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.929
Great. It's a date.

17:39.641 --> 17:41.101
It's a date!

17:47.066 --> 17:49.151
-Whenever you're ready.
-[Zym grunts]

17:50.277 --> 17:51.528
[Ezran exclaims]

17:56.033 --> 18:00.204
-What you thinkin' about?
-Nothing! What you thinkin' about?

18:02.164 --> 18:05.834
I'm thinkin'... you should go next.

18:06.627 --> 18:07.628
Go ahead.

18:08.170 --> 18:11.799
Unless you think it's not safe
for some reason?

18:12.466 --> 18:18.472
[scoffs] No. It's perfectly safe.
Let me just double-check this peg.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.358
Ah, yeah, it's safe. So safe.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.997
-[Soren exclaims]
-[peg creaks]

18:53.590 --> 18:57.010
-We can't trust Soren and Claudia.
-I thought we talked about this.

18:57.094 --> 18:59.054
But I have proof now.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.766
Soren built a zippy line thingy for Ezran,
but it was a trap.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.560
He wanted there to be an accident.

19:04.643 --> 19:08.313
-Wait. How do you know that?
-The peg was kind of loose.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.899
-Kind of?
-It was definitely loose.

19:10.983 --> 19:14.611
Which is why Soren tightened it
before he went down.

19:14.695 --> 19:17.656
So, it was loose,
but then he tightened it?

19:17.739 --> 19:19.741
Callum, I know I'm not explaining it well,

19:19.825 --> 19:22.953
but you just have to look me
in the eyes and trust me.

19:25.122 --> 19:26.832
I can see you believe it.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.710
But I've known Soren
and Claudia for years.

19:29.793 --> 19:32.171
You and I don't have that yet.

19:49.938 --> 19:52.357
Hey, are you doing something
different with your hair?

19:52.441 --> 19:55.694
Some kind of a... braid-bag flower-dealy?

19:55.777 --> 19:57.237
Yeah, it's cute. So what?

19:57.321 --> 20:00.282
We need to stay focused
on getting the princes to leave with us.

20:00.824 --> 20:04.578
I just want to make sure you're still
on mission, not just... having fun.

20:04.661 --> 20:06.622
Uh, you built a zip line today.

20:06.705 --> 20:08.707
I took no joy in that.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.636
Lujanne, I need your help.

20:21.220 --> 20:25.891
If wisdom is what you seek,
I shall do my best to fake it. [laughs]

20:25.974 --> 20:28.143
That's an old illusionist joke.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.229
Right. Um...

20:30.312 --> 20:33.315
I need my friend to trust me,
but he doesn't.

20:33.398 --> 20:35.359
And I think it's my fault.

20:36.026 --> 20:39.738
I've been keeping a secret from him,
hiding the truth.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.991
Rayla, look at the moon.

20:43.075 --> 20:46.203
Light only falls
on half its face right now,

20:46.286 --> 20:48.705
but that doesn't mean
the other half isn't there.

20:49.498 --> 20:52.751
And it is the same with you.
There are parts you keep hidden.

20:53.835 --> 20:58.257
If I want him to trust me,
don't I have to stop hiding the truth?

20:58.340 --> 21:03.887
Real trust is about accepting
even the dark parts we will never know.

21:04.763 --> 21:08.267
No. No, I don't think that's right.

21:08.350 --> 21:11.311
Lying and hiding the truth
aren't that different.

21:11.395 --> 21:15.440
Strong relationships need honesty,
the full truth.

21:16.024 --> 21:20.779
[laughs] Oh! Now you sound
like my first three husbands.

21:20.862 --> 21:23.907
I'm afraid of hurting him,
but I owe him the truth.

21:24.574 --> 21:27.119
I can't leave Callum
in the dark any longer.

21:27.202 --> 21:29.288
I have to tell him
what happened to his dad.

21:29.371 --> 21:34.751
-Hmm. I'm glad my wisdom helped.
-It didn't. It was wrong.

21:35.335 --> 21:38.630
Was it? Or was it just differently true?

21:51.184 --> 21:55.105
This true-sight serum
will strip away all illusions,

21:55.647 --> 21:59.234
and allow me to see you
for what you really are.

21:59.818 --> 22:02.779
[chanting indistinctly]

22:12.289 --> 22:13.915
[screams]

22:24.301 --> 22:30.849
Nothing? Nothing. Nothing!
Oh, you're powerless, useless.

22:31.475 --> 22:36.229
I thought you were going to be
something special, something important!

22:42.235 --> 22:44.112
[screams]

23:00.378 --> 23:01.379
[gasps]

23:02.881 --> 23:04.466
What is this place?

23:21.441 --> 23:22.275
Hi.

23:26.154 --> 23:29.407
The moon's so bright tonight.
You can see our shadows.

23:37.916 --> 23:42.712
Hey. Did you just have your hand-shadow
hold my hand-shadow?

23:42.796 --> 23:45.757
-Did I?
-[laughs] Come on!

23:45.841 --> 23:47.759
Take me to see the Nexus.

23:53.640 --> 23:54.641
Wow!

23:55.308 --> 23:58.687
It's like the moon, but more... here.

24:01.356 --> 24:04.609
-So, Claudia...
-Yeah?

24:04.693 --> 24:09.322
-Uh. I've known you for so long.
-Yeah. Me, too.

24:09.406 --> 24:11.366
Well, sure.
You've known yourself your whole life.

24:12.868 --> 24:15.036
[Claudia chuckles]

24:15.120 --> 24:19.082
-Callum, you always make me laugh.
-You make me laugh, too.

24:19.166 --> 24:24.379
And you make me think. You make me...
see the world a whole different way.

24:29.551 --> 24:33.889
Wow. I, uh...
I suddenly don't have any more words.

24:33.972 --> 24:40.812
[chuckles] That's okay.
We can just be here... without words.

24:51.072 --> 24:51.907
Wait.

24:51.990 --> 24:55.202
Callum, I need to tell you something.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.002
Callum?

25:04.586 --> 25:07.881
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
We need to talk.

25:08.965 --> 25:10.258
I know what happened.

25:11.218 --> 25:12.219
He's gone.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.473
Oh, no.
