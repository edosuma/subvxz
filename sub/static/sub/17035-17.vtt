WEBVTT

00:09.468 --> 00:11.501
Hey, Lexie.

00:14.640 --> 00:15.906
Axl!

00:16.008 --> 00:17.708
Devin?

00:17.810 --> 00:20.243
Whoa! Hey!

00:20.354 --> 00:21.720
Haven't seen you in like, a year.

00:21.822 --> 00:23.021
Yeah. Where've you been, man?

00:23.046 --> 00:25.057
I stopped by your place once,
but it was all nice,

00:25.082 --> 00:26.801
so I knew you couldn't be
living there anymore.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.493
-Wow, you -- you did?
-Yeah.

00:28.595 --> 00:29.752
How come you didn't tell me you moved?

00:29.854 --> 00:30.820
Ow! Well...

00:30.922 --> 00:33.369
I did.

00:33.659 --> 00:35.519
I moved. I'm living in a Winnebago now.

00:35.581 --> 00:36.659
Wait a minute.

00:36.684 --> 00:39.921
The infamous 'Bago parties --
That's you?

00:40.023 --> 00:40.962
Guilty.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.232
Why'd you never invite me?

00:42.334 --> 00:44.367
You know I'm always good for a six-pack!

00:44.469 --> 00:47.107
Oh, my God! This is, like, so wild.

00:47.209 --> 00:48.605
I mean, I haven't seen you
in, like, forever.

00:48.707 --> 00:50.640
Then you just show up out of the blue.

00:50.742 --> 00:51.741
Axl?

00:51.843 --> 00:53.543
Cassidy!

00:53.645 --> 00:55.829
Axl, wow! Hi!

00:55.931 --> 00:57.598
So good to see you!

00:57.700 --> 00:59.313
What are you doing here?

00:59.338 --> 01:00.630
Aren't you supposed to be at Vassar?

01:00.732 --> 01:02.362
No, no. I'm out already.

01:02.464 --> 01:04.456
I had enough credits to graduate early,

01:04.480 --> 01:06.582
which sounds great
but actually just means

01:06.684 --> 01:08.173
I'm unemployed six months earlier.

01:08.198 --> 01:11.016
Yikes. And here I thought
you were smarter than me.

01:11.118 --> 01:14.390
Oh, you're that Cassidy!
Axl's talked all about you.

01:14.415 --> 01:15.557
He has?

01:15.659 --> 01:16.625
Yeah.

01:16.727 --> 01:18.266
Cassidy, Devin. Devin, Cassidy.

01:18.291 --> 01:20.562
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you guys...

01:20.664 --> 01:21.930
No, no.

01:22.032 --> 01:24.009
I mean, well, we used to be
but before I got married.

01:24.112 --> 01:25.300
You're married!

01:25.402 --> 01:26.335
What?

01:26.360 --> 01:27.269
No, no. Not now.

01:27.371 --> 01:28.637
Not married now.

01:28.739 --> 01:30.872
I mean, it was an annulment
and, you know, it's over.

01:30.975 --> 01:32.420
It only lasted a couple of days.

01:32.445 --> 01:35.043
Who wants to do shots.
Right? Who's got...

01:37.114 --> 01:38.080
Axl?

01:38.182 --> 01:39.648
Oh, God.

01:39.750 --> 01:41.617
Wow! Hey! What are you doing here?

01:41.719 --> 01:44.219
I thought that seniors
didn't come to this party.

01:44.321 --> 01:46.510
Well, I am certainly regretting it.

01:46.612 --> 01:47.850
And who's this?

01:47.952 --> 01:50.626
This is Lexie, Sue's roommate.

01:50.728 --> 01:51.860
You look good.

01:51.962 --> 01:52.995
Thank you.

01:53.097 --> 01:56.231
I mean, uh, not just you.

01:56.333 --> 01:57.690
You're not the only one that looks good.

01:57.792 --> 02:00.151
You all look good! Everybody looks good!

02:00.253 --> 02:01.537
I'm sorry.

02:01.639 --> 02:03.124
I feel like I'm interrupting something.

02:03.226 --> 02:04.570
No, we were just catching up.

02:04.672 --> 02:06.541
Well, this could not get any weirder.

02:06.644 --> 02:07.909
Hi, Axl.

02:09.179 --> 02:11.455
A white wolf came to me
in a dream and told me

02:11.557 --> 02:14.750
if I sacrificed my hair,
you'd come back to me.

02:14.852 --> 02:17.664
You should probably make that
into tea and drink it.

02:17.766 --> 02:18.997
Oh.

02:23.427 --> 02:24.760
What the hell is that?

02:24.862 --> 02:26.455
Do you not ever listen to me?

02:26.480 --> 02:27.479
I told you guys --

02:27.581 --> 02:29.281
the library's closing down
their east wing

02:29.306 --> 02:31.483
so they can turn it
into a Tommy T's franchise.

02:31.585 --> 02:34.108
No kidding? A Tommy T's in Orson?

02:34.210 --> 02:35.688
Oh, I love Tommy T's.

02:35.790 --> 02:37.823
You're missing the point. It's sad.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.725
They're shutting down half the library

02:39.750 --> 02:41.827
because people just read
on their phones now.

02:41.896 --> 02:43.862
So to raise money
to save the other wing,

02:43.931 --> 02:46.431
they're selling all the
displaced books and equipment.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.534
That's why I got a sweet deal
on this baby.

02:48.602 --> 02:51.503
They open up again at 6:00 a.m.
if you wanna check out the sale.

02:51.572 --> 02:54.480
Yeah, I'm not getting up
at 6:00 to buy books,

02:54.549 --> 02:56.690
but I would get up at 6:00
for Tommy T's.

02:56.759 --> 02:58.062
Okay, now I'm craving

02:58.174 --> 03:00.022
a double-fried Big Tommy with bacon.

03:00.047 --> 03:02.746
They guarantee a tablespoon
of mayo in every bite.

03:02.815 --> 03:05.184
I should of stayed with the Fergusons.

03:09.898 --> 03:10.964
Is that my dress?

03:11.032 --> 03:12.239
Oh. Yeah.

03:12.308 --> 03:14.396
Remember how you said I could
borrow anything in your closet?

03:14.611 --> 03:16.411
Well, I have
the Chancellor's Ball to go to,

03:16.513 --> 03:18.006
so hope you don't mind.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.497
Please. What's the point of having

03:19.599 --> 03:20.631
a formal-gown collection

03:20.700 --> 03:22.266
if you can't share it with friends?

03:22.335 --> 03:23.935
Can I just make a teeny adjustment?

03:24.037 --> 03:25.369
Uh-huh.

03:27.841 --> 03:30.174
Ah.

03:30.276 --> 03:31.509
There.

03:31.578 --> 03:35.046
Wow, I can't believe you're
going to the Chancellor's Ball.

03:35.071 --> 03:35.976
I know.

03:36.044 --> 03:38.149
It's like the only perk of
being a Dragonette tour guide.

03:38.251 --> 03:39.917
Well, besides the mini-flashlights.

03:39.986 --> 03:42.351
So, I bit the bullet
and asked Tyler to take me.

03:42.453 --> 03:43.578
Ooh.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.423
Are things heating up between you two?

03:45.525 --> 03:47.907
I don't know. I think so.

03:47.976 --> 03:49.549
I mean, tonight he took me

03:49.618 --> 03:51.229
to the garage where they keep the carts.

03:51.648 --> 03:52.547
Ah.

03:52.649 --> 03:53.748
There's all these plugs,

03:53.850 --> 03:55.683
and you can hear everything charging.

03:55.752 --> 03:57.688
It's more romantic than it sounds.

03:57.791 --> 03:59.088
Wow, that's great!

03:59.157 --> 04:00.121
I don't know.

04:00.223 --> 04:03.724
We just started dating,
and the ball is such a big deal.

04:03.793 --> 04:05.459
I hope it's not too soon.

04:05.562 --> 04:08.296
No, the man showed you his cart garage.

04:08.887 --> 04:10.398
That is true.

04:10.921 --> 04:13.145
So, how was the party?

04:13.170 --> 04:14.970
Oh, my God, it was so weird.

04:15.072 --> 04:17.005
Out of the blue, Axl shows up.

04:17.107 --> 04:19.762
Really? He's a senior.

04:19.829 --> 04:20.998
Why would he do that?

04:21.023 --> 04:22.467
I don't know! But get this --

04:22.536 --> 04:25.166
All of his ex-girlfriends
were there, too.

04:25.191 --> 04:26.127
What?

04:26.152 --> 04:27.904
Yeah. Uh, what's her name --

04:27.972 --> 04:31.290
Uh, Devin and Cassidy
and some wizard lady.

04:31.358 --> 04:33.246
I felt so awkward.

04:33.315 --> 04:35.906
Thank God he has no idea
how I feel about him.

04:36.008 --> 04:39.586
Yeah. Thank God for that.

04:42.624 --> 04:45.125
Man, you must've had
some wild night last night.

04:45.227 --> 04:46.359
Tiny question --

04:46.462 --> 04:48.428
What's with the bag of hair?

04:48.530 --> 04:50.517
Ugh. Weird Ashley.

04:52.303 --> 04:53.673
Yeah.

04:53.698 --> 04:55.153
Weird Ashley was there,

04:55.178 --> 04:57.712
Cassidy was there, Devin was there

04:57.737 --> 04:59.206
Okay, Dorothy.

04:59.274 --> 05:00.674
How much green beer did you drink?

05:00.776 --> 05:02.342
No, seriously, man, they were all there.

05:02.367 --> 05:04.277
It was freaky.
I had to get out of there,

05:04.302 --> 05:05.879
so I told them all
I was getting us beers,

05:05.981 --> 05:08.048
beat my way out of the crowd
with this giant shamrock

05:08.073 --> 05:09.015
and never looked back.

05:09.118 --> 05:10.040
I mean, what are the odds

05:10.065 --> 05:12.130
all my ex-girlfriends
would show up at the same party?

05:12.232 --> 05:13.890
Wow! Don't you get it?

05:13.992 --> 05:15.247
It's a sign.

05:15.349 --> 05:17.193
The universe is clearly
trying to tell you something.

05:17.262 --> 05:18.217
What?

05:18.242 --> 05:19.793
I don't know. Could be about love,

05:19.895 --> 05:21.076
could be you're supposed
to pick one of 'em.

05:21.178 --> 05:23.202
But you'll never know,
my friend, because you bolted

05:23.304 --> 05:25.024
before the universe
could give you the answer.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.057
So, what do I do now?

05:26.159 --> 05:27.091
Only one thing to do.

05:27.193 --> 05:28.459
Toss this nasty hair bag

05:28.561 --> 05:30.761
and seek the guidance of a higher power.

05:30.863 --> 05:32.430
So, we're watching Matthew McConaughey

05:32.532 --> 05:33.864
in "Ghosts of Girlfriends Past?"

05:33.967 --> 05:35.733
Unless you got a better idea.

05:43.802 --> 05:46.035
Uh, what's this?

05:46.104 --> 05:47.837
The greatest day of my life!

05:47.939 --> 05:49.038
Can you believe it?

05:49.140 --> 05:50.840
We are now the proud owners

05:50.909 --> 05:53.009
of our very own microfiche machine.

05:53.078 --> 05:54.877
And just to be clear, this is mine,

05:54.946 --> 05:57.547
but I'm leaving it out
for all of us so we can use it.

05:57.615 --> 05:59.649
You actually spent money for this thing?

05:59.717 --> 06:01.834
Yep, $60.

06:01.902 --> 06:03.640
Best birthday money I ever spent.

06:03.709 --> 06:05.661
And to think
I was this close to blowing it

06:05.730 --> 06:07.356
on a goat for a starving family.

06:12.946 --> 06:13.845
Thank you.

06:13.870 --> 06:15.767
What the hell are you drinking, Heck?

06:16.126 --> 06:17.826
It's called a White Peach Bellini.

06:17.894 --> 06:19.894
Ooh. You drink girly drinks now?

06:19.963 --> 06:23.131
Clearly, without my guidance
you've gone off the rails.

06:23.233 --> 06:24.099
Oh.

06:24.167 --> 06:27.602
Uh, so, what's going on?

06:27.671 --> 06:30.238
I haven't seen you in a year,
then I run into you at a party,

06:30.340 --> 06:31.706
and now you wanna get drinks?

06:31.808 --> 06:32.907
Uh, yeah.

06:32.976 --> 06:35.276
Well, you know,
this might sound kinda strange,

06:35.345 --> 06:38.847
but, um,
I've got some questions about...

06:38.949 --> 06:40.482
the universe.

06:40.550 --> 06:43.919
Ah, universe questions. Bring it.

06:43.987 --> 06:44.905
Okay, great.

06:45.007 --> 06:47.722
So, when we were going out,
uh, I don't know,

06:47.758 --> 06:49.857
it seemed like we were
pretty good together.

06:49.926 --> 06:51.559
I mean, we both liked to hang,

06:51.628 --> 06:53.172
and we both liked to dip
our fries in mustard,

06:53.240 --> 06:54.896
we were both awesome at sports.

06:54.998 --> 06:56.164
-I'm better.
-Debatable.

06:56.233 --> 06:57.666
So, why did we break up again?

06:57.768 --> 07:00.769
Uh, you tell me. Did we, even?

07:00.837 --> 07:02.771
I mean, I know we talked
about seeing other people,

07:02.839 --> 07:04.973
but I thought we we'd still
hang out and watch football,

07:05.075 --> 07:06.608
maybe mess around a little,

07:06.677 --> 07:08.376
but you didn't text or anything.

07:08.478 --> 07:10.111
Kinda seemed like you
were sending me a message.

07:10.213 --> 07:11.279
No! No, no, no, no, no.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.647
There's no message there.
I am not that deep.

07:12.749 --> 07:14.015
Okay, a little advice --

07:14.084 --> 07:15.517
If you really wanted to see me,
you knew where I lived!

07:15.585 --> 07:16.951
Well, how was I supposed to know that?

07:17.020 --> 07:18.186
If I did, maybe it would've --

07:18.255 --> 07:19.988
Hey, if the Seahawks had handed the ball

07:20.057 --> 07:21.723
to Marshawn Lynch at the one-yard line,

07:21.825 --> 07:23.258
they could've won the Super Bowl,

07:23.360 --> 07:24.756
but, you know, whatever.

07:24.825 --> 07:26.496
Hindsight's 20/20, right?

07:27.664 --> 07:30.465
Oh, right. Other arm.

07:30.567 --> 07:31.599
Yeah.

07:37.666 --> 07:41.042
Check out this story
from the Orson Herald from 1954.

07:41.111 --> 07:44.145
"Local woman finds hat in tree."

07:44.739 --> 07:47.821
Local man on couch
wants peace and quiet.

07:48.009 --> 07:49.175
I'm telling you, Dad,

07:49.243 --> 07:51.710
this is a bottomless
fountain of information.

07:51.779 --> 07:54.580
Ooh, here's one from August 1932.

07:54.649 --> 07:56.515
"Have you seen this dog?"

07:56.617 --> 07:57.967
I wonder if they found it.

07:58.035 --> 07:59.418
That dog is dead.

07:59.487 --> 08:01.120
Everyone who cared
about that dog is dead.

08:01.222 --> 08:02.388
The new dog they bought

08:02.456 --> 08:04.456
to get over the pain of losing
that dog is dead.

08:05.218 --> 08:07.596
You're a mean, mean man.

08:08.262 --> 08:09.929
Eh.

08:14.569 --> 08:17.398
Oh, uh, it's a blood orange martini.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.972
I asked for a beer,
but the guy brought me this.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.978
Well, college is a time to experiment.

08:24.085 --> 08:26.605
So, wow.

08:26.707 --> 08:27.880
Here we are.

08:28.617 --> 08:30.620
Why are we here, exactly?

08:30.677 --> 08:32.510
Yeah, I'm just trying
to figure some stuff out.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.613
You're kind of the first girl
I ever really fell for,

08:34.715 --> 08:35.789
and it was pretty intense.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.515
I mean, we were, like,
pretty much opposites,

08:37.583 --> 08:40.126
but we managed to make it work
for a while, right?

08:40.195 --> 08:41.852
Why couldn't we make it work?

08:43.423 --> 08:46.631
Well, for one, we were
a thousand miles apart.

08:46.733 --> 08:48.891
Actually, we were 827.

08:48.926 --> 08:51.096
I should know. I drove 409 of them.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.755
Wait, what? What are you talking about?

08:53.824 --> 08:56.344
Yeah, um, actually, freshman year,

08:56.369 --> 08:58.444
I, uh, drove up to Vassar to see you,

08:58.546 --> 09:00.946
but I stopped halfway
and turned around and came home.

09:01.015 --> 09:02.848
Why did you turn around?

09:02.950 --> 09:05.785
I don't know.
I guess I just kinda freaked.

09:05.853 --> 09:08.387
Thought you might not want to see me.

09:09.199 --> 09:11.779
See, that's kind of the problem, Axl.

09:11.881 --> 09:14.193
You were never clear
about what you wanted.

09:14.295 --> 09:16.740
Well, I think driving
halfway to your dorm

09:16.765 --> 09:17.931
without ever telling you

09:18.033 --> 09:19.766
sent a pretty strong-ish message.

09:20.903 --> 09:23.095
Look, that's all water under the bridge.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.329
So, how are you doing?

09:24.398 --> 09:25.739
I mean, you got divorced?

09:25.841 --> 09:28.008
Yeah, it's kinda weird.

09:28.077 --> 09:30.544
But I'm still dating my ex-wife,
so that's cool.

09:30.646 --> 09:33.450
Uh, and I made
the Dean's list this year...

09:33.519 --> 09:36.608
of, um, people graduating.

09:38.000 --> 09:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:46.002 --> 09:47.368
Surprise!

09:47.436 --> 09:49.470
Sean! Hey! What are you doing here?

09:49.572 --> 09:50.538
Axl's not around.

09:50.640 --> 09:52.106
I know. I actually came for you.

09:52.175 --> 09:53.320
Really?

09:53.347 --> 09:54.508
I seem to recall somebody

09:54.610 --> 09:57.278
wanting to go to the Chancellor's Ball.

09:58.039 --> 10:00.140
Wait, who told you?
How did you know about that?

10:00.165 --> 10:01.269
You did.

10:01.338 --> 10:02.792
Back when I was over here
helping you with your desk,

10:02.817 --> 10:04.126
you were saying you weren't sure

10:04.228 --> 10:05.595
if you were gonna go
'cause you didn't have a date.

10:05.663 --> 10:07.600
And I was walking on my campus yesterday

10:07.669 --> 10:09.060
and it was really warm and pretty out

10:09.085 --> 10:10.713
and I remembered this word
you made up when we were young

10:10.782 --> 10:13.725
to describe days like that
where it suddenly is warm again.

10:13.750 --> 10:15.540
-Springalicious?
-Springalicious.

10:15.565 --> 10:17.456
And it made me think of you
and I was like,

10:17.525 --> 10:19.106
"Why am I thinking of Sue right now?"

10:19.175 --> 10:21.652
And then I remembered
this was your weekend.

10:21.721 --> 10:25.389
So, Suzy Q, on this beautiful
springalicious occasion,

10:25.458 --> 10:27.667
may I have the honor of escorting you

10:27.769 --> 10:29.446
to the Chancellor's Ball?

10:31.998 --> 10:33.889
Oh, Sean.

10:33.958 --> 10:38.565
Don't you have a cellphone?
You could call ahead first?

10:38.667 --> 10:42.498
I actually have a date.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.566
Oh.

10:45.903 --> 10:47.503
Yeah, I didn't -- I didn't call

10:47.572 --> 10:49.372
because I thought the surprise
would be nice.

10:49.793 --> 10:51.117
That was dumb.

10:51.186 --> 10:53.175
I just figured third time
was the charm, you know.

10:53.244 --> 10:56.989
You're gonna owe me for
tux rentals if I keep this up.

10:57.091 --> 11:00.590
But, hey, the important thing
is that you're happy.

11:01.786 --> 11:04.022
I just wanted to make sure
you had the chance to go.

11:05.957 --> 11:07.423
Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

11:08.109 --> 11:10.593
Do you have to go already?
Why don't you stay a while.

11:10.662 --> 11:13.296
We could get a pizza
or hang out or something.

11:13.364 --> 11:16.666
I promise I won't make you
put together any more furniture.

11:17.514 --> 11:18.613
I --

11:19.063 --> 11:22.038
No, no. I -- It's okay.

11:22.106 --> 11:24.340
I should get back to Orson,
spend some time with my folks

11:24.442 --> 11:27.109
before going up to school,
and, uh, yeah.

11:27.212 --> 11:30.246
Have fun at the ball, Suzy Q.
You deserve it.

11:30.348 --> 11:31.714
Oh, but...

11:33.985 --> 11:35.585
Okay.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.378
It's been great catching up, Axl.

11:42.493 --> 11:44.512
If you're in Italy this summer,
look me up.

11:44.537 --> 11:45.636
I will!

11:45.705 --> 11:46.971
It's the one that's shaped
like a boot, right?

11:54.080 --> 11:56.180
I've been watching what's been going on.

11:56.282 --> 11:57.581
I know I'm next.

12:03.348 --> 12:04.856
Ask me whatever you want.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.162
And I brought you a drink.

12:06.230 --> 12:07.550
Yeah, I'm not drinking that.

12:07.627 --> 12:08.393
I wouldn't.

12:08.462 --> 12:09.652
Actually, no, you know what?

12:09.721 --> 12:11.239
Now that you're here,
I-I do have a question.

12:11.307 --> 12:13.367
Um, why do you like me?

12:13.435 --> 12:15.558
It doesn't seem like I'd be your type.

12:15.660 --> 12:16.793
I'll always be here,

12:16.895 --> 12:19.709
in this lifetime
and the next, for eternity.

12:19.777 --> 12:20.755
But I don't get it.

12:20.780 --> 12:22.056
Why are you wasting your time on me

12:22.125 --> 12:23.333
when there's probably some other guy --

12:23.402 --> 12:25.838
or merman -- who'd be perfect for you?

12:25.907 --> 12:27.588
I mean, I've been telling you
for a long time

12:27.657 --> 12:29.343
nothing's ever gonna happen between us.

12:29.374 --> 12:30.373
No, you haven't.

12:30.475 --> 12:32.142
You never told me you didn't like me.

12:32.244 --> 12:33.209
I didn't?

12:33.278 --> 12:35.512
No. You took me to prom twice.

12:35.537 --> 12:37.381
Um...

12:37.495 --> 12:40.120
If you didn't want to be with
me, why didn't you just say so?

12:40.894 --> 12:42.944
You're not very clear
with your signals, Axl.

12:44.347 --> 12:45.625
Maybe you should just sit here

12:45.694 --> 12:47.322
and think about all the pain
you've caused me.

12:47.391 --> 12:49.836
And I hope it's reflected in my tip.

12:58.802 --> 13:00.268
Hello, Mother.

13:00.797 --> 13:03.266
Anything you'd like to, uh, tell me?

13:07.148 --> 13:08.879
That was five months ago.

13:08.948 --> 13:12.907
No, it's something else,
something more revealing,

13:12.932 --> 13:15.510
something very interesting I found

13:15.612 --> 13:17.640
in my microfiche from 1983.

13:17.709 --> 13:20.181
More interesting
than the hat in the tree?

13:20.250 --> 13:21.049
Yes.

13:21.151 --> 13:23.084
My mother -- your wife --

13:23.153 --> 13:25.119
was arrested for indecent exposure.

13:25.188 --> 13:27.221
It was all right there in the Herald.

13:27.290 --> 13:30.391
Oh, my God, I forgot about that.

13:30.493 --> 13:32.166
Oh, Brick, it was nothing.

13:32.268 --> 13:33.394
When we were seniors,

13:33.496 --> 13:36.230
my friends and I went streaking
through the Denny's parking lot.

13:36.332 --> 13:37.632
Eh, we thought it was funny.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.267
Just a harmless high school prank.

13:39.335 --> 13:40.802
We didn't think we'd get caught.

13:40.870 --> 13:42.970
Who would've thought
there'd be cops at Denny's?

13:43.039 --> 13:45.255
Well, it was quite the scandal
at the time.

13:45.357 --> 13:46.809
The whole town was talking about it.

13:46.911 --> 13:49.243
Well, don't you worry that it
could come back to haunt you?

13:49.312 --> 13:51.612
I mean, anyone with a microfiche
machine can see this.

13:51.681 --> 13:53.147
It's what high schoolers do.

13:53.216 --> 13:54.916
They take risks and do dumb pranks.

13:55.018 --> 13:56.751
Did you ever do anything like that?

13:56.853 --> 13:58.052
Oh, you kidding me?

13:58.121 --> 14:01.289
When I was in high school,
we had this algebra teacher,

14:01.391 --> 14:02.457
total jerk.

14:02.525 --> 14:04.759
He drove a Fiero
with vanity license plates

14:04.861 --> 14:06.549
that said "COOLGUY."

14:07.007 --> 14:08.073
A little tip --

14:08.098 --> 14:10.225
anybody who has plates
that say "COOLGUY,"

14:10.311 --> 14:11.243
not a cool guy.

14:11.372 --> 14:13.522
So, I had this buddy
that was a mechanic,

14:13.569 --> 14:15.017
and one night when Mr. Coolguy

14:15.042 --> 14:18.445
was at some band concert,
me and a bunch of guys

14:18.514 --> 14:22.534
took apart his Fiero
and rebuilt it in the library.

14:22.636 --> 14:24.736
Why would you do that to a library?

14:24.838 --> 14:27.606
The library was fine.
You're missing the point.

14:27.675 --> 14:30.008
It was just a prank. It's what kids do.

14:30.110 --> 14:31.843
My friends and I have never done that.

14:31.946 --> 14:33.420
Well, you guys are a bunch of nerds.

14:33.445 --> 14:34.379
Mike!

14:34.481 --> 14:35.380
What?

14:35.482 --> 14:36.815
Not like it's a secret or something.

14:36.840 --> 14:37.629
He knows what he is.

14:37.654 --> 14:38.951
Mm-hmm.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.026
I mean, this is the third time

14:45.051 --> 14:46.417
he showed up to take me to a dance.

14:46.519 --> 14:49.065
I just feel bad because
I never end up going with him.

14:49.090 --> 14:50.592
He's always so nice.

14:50.657 --> 14:51.689
He was the first person

14:51.758 --> 14:53.381
to tell me he liked my hair
after I cut it.

14:53.450 --> 14:54.782
Sean sounds like a great guy.

14:54.817 --> 14:57.452
Oh, super great.
I just hope he's not hurt.

14:57.521 --> 15:00.698
He drove such a long way,
and it was such a nice gesture.

15:00.767 --> 15:03.034
No, a nice gesture
is if you drive an hour.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.836
I don't know what you call
a gesture after five hours.

15:05.938 --> 15:07.371
Did I tell you it was five hours?

15:07.440 --> 15:09.607
You know, you've been talking
an awful lot about Sean.

15:09.709 --> 15:10.708
Have I?

15:12.020 --> 15:13.741
Sue, remember how Julia broke up with me

15:13.810 --> 15:15.763
because I was talking about you
all the time?

15:15.923 --> 15:17.062
It kinda feels like there's somebody

15:17.130 --> 15:18.215
you'd rather be going to this ball with.

15:18.595 --> 15:19.594
What?

15:19.619 --> 15:21.410
No, no, no, no, no. I really like you.

15:21.479 --> 15:23.239
That's why I asked you and everything.

15:23.308 --> 15:26.315
I just didn't realize
Sean would even want to come.

15:26.350 --> 15:29.051
I mean, he is a very social guy,
and he does love to dance.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.133
One time at our block party --

15:31.201 --> 15:33.155
Sue, if you want Sean
to take you, it's not too late.

15:33.257 --> 15:35.431
Oh, no, no, no, no.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.248
Tyler, I really couldn't do that to you.

15:37.350 --> 15:38.321
No, really, it's cool.

15:38.390 --> 15:40.081
I'm not just saying this to be nice.

15:40.183 --> 15:41.245
I mean, yeah, I like you,

15:41.270 --> 15:43.146
but we've only been dating
for three weeks

15:43.215 --> 15:45.284
and it's mostly been
hauling around drunks.

15:45.353 --> 15:47.753
I don't wanna be competing
with some other guy already.

15:47.822 --> 15:50.122
So I think if you like this Sean,

15:50.191 --> 15:53.926
you should probably go talk
to him and figure that out.

15:56.798 --> 15:58.864
Oh, my God. Do you think?

15:58.933 --> 15:59.999
Yeah.

16:00.024 --> 16:02.720
I mean, we've known each other
our whole lives.

16:03.787 --> 16:06.162
But, no, he's already in Orson,

16:06.231 --> 16:07.819
and he's going back to Notre Dame.

16:07.888 --> 16:10.027
Orson's only 42 minutes away.

16:10.240 --> 16:12.747
You -- You told me that a lot, too.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.336
Hey, Brick, everything okay?

16:20.405 --> 16:23.119
Not really.

16:23.221 --> 16:24.374
You know how you guys were talking

16:24.476 --> 16:26.142
about high schoolers pulling pranks?

16:26.211 --> 16:29.114
I don't know. You made it sound so fun.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.643
And I thought,
since I've never done one,

16:30.705 --> 16:32.492
that I would try my hand at a prank.

16:32.909 --> 16:34.360
Please tell me you didn't go streaking.

16:34.429 --> 16:36.308
The '80s were a very different time.

16:36.333 --> 16:38.776
No, I had this great idea to change

16:38.801 --> 16:40.514
the Dewey Decimal System in the library

16:40.583 --> 16:42.483
by switching the 500s with the 900s.

16:42.585 --> 16:45.319
People would go up to a shelf
expecting books on botany,

16:45.388 --> 16:47.688
but instead they'd get
ancient civilizations.

16:47.757 --> 16:52.126
Everyone would be like, "What?
What crazy man did this?"

16:53.846 --> 16:55.156
You'd be the first to do it.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.547
I know! Right?

16:56.649 --> 16:59.073
I had this whole elaborate plan,
like "Ocean's Eleven."

16:59.101 --> 17:01.468
I was gonna push the cart,
Troy was the muscle,

17:01.537 --> 17:02.836
Cindy was the femme fatale.

17:02.905 --> 17:04.932
But they just weren't into it.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.364
So, guess I'll graduate high school

17:07.433 --> 17:08.407
without an epic story.

17:08.510 --> 17:11.478
Maybe that's my story -- no story.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.500
Axl, I know we're supposed
to go out for dinner,

17:20.525 --> 17:22.156
but I didn't eat anything at noon,

17:22.223 --> 17:24.230
so could we go out for lunch instead?

17:24.332 --> 17:25.865
It's not healthy to skip meals.

17:25.967 --> 17:28.758
Yeah, listen, April, we need to talk.

17:28.860 --> 17:30.199
Um...

17:31.818 --> 17:34.252
I've been feeling
really conflicted lately.

17:34.321 --> 17:36.855
I feel like things
have been weird between us

17:36.923 --> 17:38.089
since the annulment.

17:38.124 --> 17:40.707
But I'm 22, and I just don't feel

17:41.394 --> 17:43.355
ready to settle down just yet.

17:43.424 --> 17:45.230
Even though I know we already did.

17:45.298 --> 17:46.664
Before, I would've just let things

17:46.766 --> 17:48.398
keep doing what they're doing.

17:48.467 --> 17:50.741
But it's just not fair, you know?

17:50.809 --> 17:53.938
Like, if I feel like we
don't have a future together,

17:54.007 --> 17:56.540
I should just be clear
and say what I mean.

17:56.642 --> 17:58.576
And what I mean is...

18:00.780 --> 18:03.941
We should break up.

18:07.295 --> 18:08.561
Wow.

18:09.780 --> 18:12.498
I guess the first clue should've
been when we got divorced.

18:12.567 --> 18:16.402
Yeah, well, that was one.

18:16.471 --> 18:22.000
So, then, did you ever love me?

18:22.310 --> 18:24.130
Yes! Of course.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.553
And some part of me always will.

18:27.215 --> 18:29.590
Just not enough to date me.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.861
It's fine.

18:31.886 --> 18:33.038
I get it.

18:33.107 --> 18:35.264
You don't have to hit me over
the head to let me know stuff.

18:36.190 --> 18:39.393
I don't want to make a scene,
so I'll just go.

18:48.177 --> 18:49.476
What the hell are you doing?

18:49.578 --> 18:51.511
Aunt Edie's car died
and I gotta get to Orson!

18:51.614 --> 18:53.614
Uh, kinda in the middle
of something here, Sue!

18:53.716 --> 18:55.682
I gotta talk to Sean!
Now stop distracting me!

18:55.784 --> 18:57.084
This is like driving a whale!

18:57.152 --> 18:58.919
You ever heard of a phone?
Just call him.

18:58.988 --> 19:00.721
He's not answering and I gotta catch him

19:00.789 --> 19:02.289
before he goes back to Notre Dame!

19:02.391 --> 19:03.257
Okay, let me drive.

19:03.359 --> 19:04.625
No, you'll stop! Every second counts!

19:04.727 --> 19:05.826
At least let us out!

19:05.928 --> 19:07.728
No, I'm not stopping
till I get to Orson!

19:10.900 --> 19:13.734
 There's a reason
you go your separate ways

19:13.836 --> 19:15.555
right after a breakup.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.100
Ooh.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.658
How's that?

19:30.727 --> 19:31.968
If we don't do something with butts,

19:32.037 --> 19:33.369
then I don't know what we're doing here.

19:33.438 --> 19:34.437
This is so epic.

19:34.539 --> 19:36.005
Years from now,
I'll be telling the story

19:36.107 --> 19:37.941
about how I pulled a prank
with my parents!

19:38.043 --> 19:40.343
You might wanna leave
the parents part out.

19:40.412 --> 19:42.248
Oh, wait. I've got one.

19:46.051 --> 19:48.176
"Cake beak pan farts."

19:48.245 --> 19:49.978
Okay.

19:50.080 --> 19:53.248
I like, "Pancake breakfast Saturday."

20:10.205 --> 20:14.238
So, thanks for taking this so well.

20:18.259 --> 20:20.518
Mrs. Donahue! Mrs. Donahue!

20:21.039 --> 20:21.946
Is Sean here?

20:21.971 --> 20:23.137
Oh, no, I'm sorry, Sue.

20:23.239 --> 20:25.308
He left for Notre Dame hours ago.

20:26.201 --> 20:28.955
Don't you look beautiful!

20:29.231 --> 20:30.297
Wait.

20:30.349 --> 20:31.908
Aren't you supposed to be at a ball?

20:32.114 --> 20:35.216
Yeah, well,
the situation kind of changed.

20:35.318 --> 20:38.586
Oh, honey. Do you still need a date?

20:38.688 --> 20:40.921
Ron can take you. Ron!

20:41.024 --> 20:43.357
No, I'm good. I'm good.

20:43.459 --> 20:44.658
You sure?

20:44.761 --> 20:47.225
I was a little worried when
you pulled up in such a hurry.

20:48.128 --> 20:49.964
Yeah. Well...

20:50.708 --> 20:52.171
I was just chasing something

20:52.273 --> 20:54.235
that probably wasn't
even really a thing.

20:54.337 --> 20:57.865
I'm fine. I'm fine, really.

21:00.510 --> 21:04.334
So, Sue rejected one prince
and chased down another.

21:04.722 --> 21:05.746
And although she didn't

21:05.848 --> 21:08.632
get to go to the ball
with either of them,

21:08.657 --> 21:12.153
the unlikeliest of princes
came to her rescue.

21:17.527 --> 21:19.736
Cool! Open bar!

21:19.838 --> 21:22.129
You ever tasted a Creamsicle margarita?

21:22.231 --> 21:23.431
Ooh.
