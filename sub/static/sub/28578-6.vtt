00:10.212 --> 00:11.412
Donald Trump Jr.

00:11.437 --> 00:13.937
is testifying to the Senate
Intelligence Committee.

00:13.962 --> 00:17.297
Unfortunately, news cameras
are not allowed inside.

00:17.322 --> 00:20.290
_

00:20.818 --> 00:23.285
Would the witness please
state your name for the record?

00:23.310 --> 00:25.777
D... Uh... Donald Trump Jr.

00:25.802 --> 00:30.104
Uh, previous aliases include
"D-T-J", "His Royal Drinkiness",

00:30.129 --> 00:33.731
"Señor Bong", "The Freak",
"2 Fast, 2 Junior-ous",

00:33.756 --> 00:35.761
- and "Sir Shits-Himself".
- Great.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.327
Did the President have
advanced knowledge

00:37.329 --> 00:38.395
of the Trump Tower meeting?

00:38.419 --> 00:40.786
Yeah, but only because
he can see the future!

00:40.811 --> 00:43.646
Like, yesterday, he said he
just knows he's going to prison.

00:43.671 --> 00:45.278
- That's spooky!
- Jesus Christ.

00:45.303 --> 00:46.768
You guys are lawyers, right?

00:46.770 --> 00:49.338
So, okay, I backed over
this pizza delivery kid,

00:49.363 --> 00:51.863
and his big-ass Adam's
apple dinged my bumper!

00:51.888 --> 00:53.455
Am I entitled to compensation?

00:53.480 --> 00:54.713
Please let's stay on topic.

00:55.894 --> 00:58.094
The secret is to launch the firecracker

00:58.119 --> 00:59.919
from the bottom of your crack.

01:01.036 --> 01:03.624
It stings a little, but
you get drunker faster!

01:04.706 --> 01:06.652
Russia collusion? Not I!

01:06.677 --> 01:09.234
I've been crab-fishing on the high seas!

01:09.259 --> 01:11.326
Did you hide a sailor
suit in the bathroom?

01:11.328 --> 01:12.894
How do you feel about your father

01:12.896 --> 01:14.363
putting you in this situation?

01:14.388 --> 01:16.054
Oh, no! Here it comes!

01:17.570 --> 01:19.303
I'll tell you everything!

01:22.921 --> 01:27.056
But when I'm in jail, you
guys have to take Kim fishing!

01:27.081 --> 01:30.049
Wait. Does that person have to
type everything I say?

01:30.074 --> 01:32.207
Yes, it's the stenographer.

01:32.232 --> 01:34.266
Ass! Whoa! She typed it.

01:34.489 --> 01:37.523
Ass, ass, balls! She typed that, too!

01:37.548 --> 01:39.881
♪ Ass, ass, ass, balls ♪

01:39.906 --> 01:42.107
♪ Ass, ass, ass, balls ♪

01:42.258 --> 01:43.648
♪ Ass, ass, ass, balls,
ass, ass, ass, balls ♪

01:43.672 --> 01:44.702
- Okay. Stop it. Stop.
- ♪ Ass, ass, ass, balls ♪

01:44.726 --> 01:45.829
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- ♪ Ass, ass, ass, balls ♪

01:45.853 --> 01:47.305
♪ Ass, ass, ass, balls,
ass, ass, ass, balls ♪

01:47.329 --> 01:48.531
♪ Ass, ass, ass, balls ♪

01:48.556 --> 01:51.265
♪ Ass, ass, ass, balls,
ass, ass, ass, ass, ass ♪

01:51.290 --> 01:53.023
♪ B-a-a-a-a-alls ♪

01:53.048 --> 01:55.015
- She's still typing!
- That's enough!

01:55.900 --> 01:57.400
And could you read that back for us?

01:57.425 --> 01:58.892
"Ass, ass, ass, balls."

01:58.916 --> 02:00.750
"Ass, ass, ass, balls."

02:02.501 --> 02:04.302
You like my sign?

02:04.558 --> 02:06.524
Okay, who built this sign?!

02:13.846 --> 02:15.879
Pizzuh-hut, Soldiers!

02:15.904 --> 02:19.705
We're here in one of Iraq's
most Middle Eastern-y cities

02:19.730 --> 02:23.565
to recognize the troops
and women dressed as troops

02:23.590 --> 02:26.959
for their tremendous
service in wars or whatever.

02:26.984 --> 02:28.650
Mr. President, I want to introduce you

02:28.675 --> 02:30.942
to one of our bravest,
Sergeant Tully. She's...

02:30.967 --> 02:33.267
Shit! I friggin' whiffed!

02:33.292 --> 02:36.160
I wish I could be there to
shake your dehydrated hands,

02:36.185 --> 02:37.785
but, you know, golf.

02:37.810 --> 02:40.210
We understand. You're very busy, sir.

02:40.235 --> 02:43.136
Hey, you got the next, much
worse thing, Mike Pence.

02:43.161 --> 02:45.294
Shake their hands for me, Mikey!

02:45.319 --> 02:47.586
Pardon my use of the Pence family glove.

02:47.611 --> 02:49.878
Karen says, "Touching
a career woman's hand

02:49.903 --> 02:52.282
is a backstage pass to Hades' land."

02:52.307 --> 02:55.975
Don't shake her hand loud!
It'll distract my swing!

02:56.000 --> 02:57.500
_

02:57.525 --> 02:58.957
I'm Jake Tapper.

02:58.982 --> 03:01.082
And a reminder for folks at home...

03:01.107 --> 03:03.141
no talking during my show.

03:03.166 --> 03:06.262
It appears the President
would rather grip his five-iron

03:06.287 --> 03:08.321
than the hand of a soldier.

03:08.391 --> 03:09.724
This behavior has been satirized

03:09.749 --> 03:12.483
by some of America's
most skilled cartoonists,

03:12.508 --> 03:15.609
including TV newsman Jake Tapper.

03:15.634 --> 03:18.235
Let's check in with President Chump.

03:18.878 --> 03:21.445
President Chump was golfing,

03:21.751 --> 03:25.268
when he should've been
respecting our troops.

03:26.384 --> 03:30.019
It seems this presidency
is hitting a lot of bogies.

03:30.044 --> 03:33.011
_

03:33.036 --> 03:34.135
And that's our show.

03:34.160 --> 03:36.895
Sorry we didn't get to
the Flint water crisis.

03:36.950 --> 03:38.315
Tapper is relentless.

03:38.340 --> 03:40.359
Announce my resignation before he draws

03:40.384 --> 03:42.017
another President Chump!

03:42.042 --> 03:44.076
Everything's gonna be fine!

03:44.101 --> 03:46.734
Let's just fly you to Iraq
to shake a few hands,

03:46.759 --> 03:50.161
hug a few flags, go pat-pat
on a tank like it's a Corgi.

03:50.186 --> 03:54.055
How about instead of Iraq,
I fly to... wait for it...

03:54.122 --> 03:55.287
Mar-a-Lago?

03:55.289 --> 03:57.156
Mar-a-Lago! Yes!

03:57.181 --> 04:00.382
A lot of the club members are
military defense contractors.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.574
Why talk to a soldier about war

04:02.599 --> 04:05.800
when you can laugh with a
billionaire about war crimes?

04:05.825 --> 04:08.758
You could simply mouth the words
"Thank you for your service,"

04:08.783 --> 04:10.283
and I'll fill in the voice later.

04:10.308 --> 04:13.197
"Ehhh! Thank you
for your service. Ehhh!"

04:13.222 --> 04:17.007
It's their job! Am I supposed
to thank this Robo-Vacuum, too?

04:17.033 --> 04:18.333
Without the Robo-Vacuum,

04:18.358 --> 04:20.591
you'd be ankle deep in Pop-Tart crumbs.

04:20.616 --> 04:22.249
Why don't we just
invite Bill Shine back?

04:22.274 --> 04:24.874
- He's the king of optics.
- No, no, Conway.

04:24.899 --> 04:28.401
I got a simple no-fuss solution
to put this issue to bed.

04:28.426 --> 04:31.694
It's time to bring home all
the brave, sweaty troops,

04:31.719 --> 04:35.521
and no troops means no me
sitting on a plane for ten hours

04:35.546 --> 04:38.280
just to shake hands
with some guy named Kyle.

04:38.305 --> 04:39.504
Okay. World peace.

04:39.529 --> 04:40.997
Was the Defense Department made aware?

04:41.021 --> 04:44.055
Chopper's too loud!
Can't hear you! Ha, ha!

04:44.681 --> 04:46.014
Whatever, Louis!

04:46.039 --> 04:48.605
I didn't even want to go
hunting with you anyway!

04:48.787 --> 04:51.128
Ever since I started using
every waking moment

04:51.153 --> 04:53.186
of my adult life to compliment my dad,

04:53.211 --> 04:54.644
I have, like, no friends!

04:54.669 --> 04:55.969
I'm your friend!

04:55.994 --> 04:58.327
You're not my friend, Eric.
You're my brother and enemy.

04:58.352 --> 05:00.719
I'm not even getting
likes on this dank photo

05:00.744 --> 05:03.278
of me playing patty-cake
with a jaguar carcass!

05:03.422 --> 05:06.022
- Elon Musk liked it.
- Yeah, right.

05:06.024 --> 05:10.260
Like Mr. Tesla himself,
owner of "stankmemes.com",

05:10.285 --> 05:12.486
would ever like my dumb Po-oh...

05:12.511 --> 05:15.045
my... ass.

05:15.070 --> 05:16.602
_

05:16.627 --> 05:18.494
Joining me now to
discuss the President's

05:18.519 --> 05:21.953
sudden mass troop withdrawal...
self-appointed spokesman

05:21.978 --> 05:23.845
for millions of unwitting servicemen,

05:23.870 --> 05:25.136
Senator Lindsey Graham.

05:25.161 --> 05:27.278
The only way to keep this country safe

05:27.303 --> 05:29.928
is to have troops in Yemen for so long

05:29.953 --> 05:32.611
that, when they come home,
their dogs forget their scent

05:32.636 --> 05:34.117
and have to take cues from the room

05:34.119 --> 05:35.819
that they should be jumping
around all silly-like.

05:35.843 --> 05:40.046
Which brings us to the latest
installment of President Chump.

05:40.125 --> 05:41.290
Do I have to stay?

05:42.917 --> 05:46.152
The President is withdrawing the troops.

05:46.177 --> 05:48.978
You can't do that at the ATM.

05:49.003 --> 05:51.744
It's not the American Troop Machine.

05:51.769 --> 05:52.868
_

05:52.893 --> 05:54.393
Unfortunately, the only currency

05:54.418 --> 05:56.485
the military accepts is respect,

05:56.510 --> 06:00.371
a phrase made famous by
soul singer Aretha Franklin.

06:00.396 --> 06:02.629
♪ Aretha Franklin ♪

06:02.654 --> 06:05.889
Tapper, stop! I'm a
human being, damn it!

06:05.914 --> 06:08.148
Sir, you can't withdraw
the entire military

06:08.173 --> 06:10.172
just to avoid awkward conversation.

06:10.197 --> 06:11.763
Just pretend the troops are me

06:11.788 --> 06:14.056
and replicate our natural,
jazz-like banter.

06:14.081 --> 06:16.547
The closest our
conversations get to jazz

06:16.572 --> 06:18.839
is when I threaten to
beat you with a saxophone.

06:18.864 --> 06:21.431
The bottom line is
the perpetual war state

06:21.456 --> 06:23.144
only allows the commander-in-chief

06:23.169 --> 06:27.135
to add troops or shuffle the
more confused ones to the back.

06:29.696 --> 06:31.863
Bill Shine. What are you doing here?

06:31.888 --> 06:33.354
Kellyanne told me you're upset.

06:33.379 --> 06:34.945
You only called into Fox & Friends

06:34.970 --> 06:36.803
for 70 minutes today?

06:36.828 --> 06:38.490
Bill, everyone acts like

06:38.515 --> 06:41.216
troops sacrifice more
than I do for this country.

06:41.241 --> 06:43.228
Did you know they let injured veterans

06:43.253 --> 06:44.852
skip the line at Space Mountain?

06:44.854 --> 06:45.921
Doesn't seem right!

06:45.946 --> 06:48.113
That's exactly what I told Goofy.

06:48.138 --> 06:51.539
It's as if my injury doesn't matter.

06:51.709 --> 06:54.910
It was 1969, and I was shipping out

06:54.935 --> 06:57.402
for my fifth deferment from Vietnam.

06:57.427 --> 06:58.860
Nixon had been elected.

06:58.885 --> 07:01.780
Loser John McCain was
still in a P-O-W camp

07:01.805 --> 07:03.204
for being a total loser,

07:03.229 --> 07:06.263
and my foot had an appointment
with the podiatrist.

07:06.288 --> 07:09.623
America's most notorious
draft dodgers were there...

07:09.648 --> 07:11.748
Dutch, an English major from Yale...

07:11.773 --> 07:14.641
Snake Stan from Harvard,
an English major.

07:14.666 --> 07:17.233
And Grunt. By God, he was only 18,

07:17.258 --> 07:20.292
celebrating his last summer
before shipping off to Yale

07:20.317 --> 07:22.852
for his double major in
literature and English.

07:22.877 --> 07:26.244
Give it to me straight, Doc,
exactly how my dad told you to.

07:26.269 --> 07:28.136
You have bone spurs.

07:28.161 --> 07:30.194
♪ My foot hurts ♪

07:30.219 --> 07:32.976
- ♪ Yeah ♪
- ♪ My foot hurts ♪

07:33.001 --> 07:35.135
I left my innocence on the carpet

07:35.137 --> 07:36.937
of that podiatrist's office.

07:36.962 --> 07:39.015
- We all did.
- It's disgraceful

07:39.040 --> 07:41.609
how America treats its
draft-dodging scions!

07:41.611 --> 07:42.643
I'll handle this.

07:42.668 --> 07:44.722
You just focus on being
the first president

07:44.747 --> 07:47.681
to say "dongasorus" on Yom Kippur.

07:47.683 --> 07:50.117
Did you know Elon Musk went bald

07:50.119 --> 07:52.786
and genius-scienced an
entire new head of hair?

07:52.811 --> 07:54.278
Just like Dad!

07:54.303 --> 07:56.369
Dad's hair is real, idiot!

08:01.187 --> 08:03.854
Any moment now, I will be high.

08:03.879 --> 08:07.147
Hello? This is Elon Musk.
You're living in a simulation.

08:07.172 --> 08:11.073
Hey! This is Don Junior Trump.
You know, from the news?

08:11.197 --> 08:14.999
Ohh. Don Junior Trump.
How did you get my number?

08:15.024 --> 08:16.791
You tweeted that you
paid five million bucks

08:16.816 --> 08:18.449
for the number 420-6-9.

08:18.474 --> 08:20.044
Oh, lé cool.

08:20.069 --> 08:23.403
So you're the Trump kid
with the jaguar carcass?

08:23.428 --> 08:26.063
Yeah! You should come by
and shoot it some more!

08:26.088 --> 08:29.022
And maybe hang out? Is that awkward?

08:29.047 --> 08:31.447
- Desperate, much?!
- I'm nervous!

08:31.472 --> 08:33.740
No, no, it's not awkward turtle.

08:33.765 --> 08:35.831
I'm pretty busy innovating right now.

08:35.856 --> 08:36.857
Uh...

08:36.881 --> 08:39.748
But I could come by
in, like, 18.4 minutes.

08:41.931 --> 08:43.931
Look at these brave soldiers.

08:43.956 --> 08:46.557
This is how we're gonna
fix your handshake problem.

08:46.582 --> 08:50.250
For decades, rumors spread that
this flag planting was staged,

08:50.275 --> 08:53.359
a bigger sham than Glenn
Beck becoming a scarf guy!

08:53.384 --> 08:54.918
But validity doesn't matter

08:54.943 --> 08:57.267
if the story is prime for marbleizing.

08:57.292 --> 08:58.925
Don't shake it. Fake it!

08:58.950 --> 09:02.919
Shine, last time I participated
in a misinformation campaign,

09:02.944 --> 09:05.845
I became president of
the United States. Barf.

09:05.870 --> 09:08.060
Fair enough. I guess you could sacrifice

09:08.062 --> 09:10.195
one weekend and fly to Iraq...

09:14.676 --> 09:16.676
Describe when you feel
the pain in your feet.

09:16.701 --> 09:18.768
Every time I almost
serve in the military,

09:18.793 --> 09:20.214
it stings pretty bad.

09:21.660 --> 09:24.561
I've already made one sacrifice
for this country, Bill,

09:24.586 --> 09:26.285
and I'm not about to make another.

09:26.310 --> 09:28.244
Then, Mr. President, let's fake

09:28.269 --> 09:30.641
you shaking a soldier's hand.

09:31.501 --> 09:32.766
What the hell was that?

09:32.791 --> 09:34.191
A fake-out, sir.

09:34.216 --> 09:35.664
Oh, I get it.

09:35.689 --> 09:37.856
Do that again, and I'll fucking kill ya.

09:40.479 --> 09:41.884
So, what's the best way

09:41.908 --> 09:43.422
to fake this troop handshake?

09:43.447 --> 09:45.309
I-I'm new to this whole lying thing.

09:46.824 --> 09:48.658
Okay, okay.

09:48.683 --> 09:50.216
I said okay!

09:50.241 --> 09:52.641
This country has a
rich history of fakery,

09:52.666 --> 09:55.601
like pretending we care about
human rights in South America

09:55.626 --> 09:57.492
and not just their tasty bananas.

09:57.517 --> 09:59.830
If you need any fake
Iraqi backdrops painted,

09:59.855 --> 10:03.090
it's watercolor week at
Karen's heterosexual art class.

10:03.115 --> 10:04.381
I can take every textbook

10:04.406 --> 10:06.439
and paste a bit about you visiting Iraq

10:06.464 --> 10:09.398
over the ten-word summary on
that whole Rosa Parks bus thing.

10:09.423 --> 10:12.758
These are the worst goddamn
pitches I've ever heard!

10:12.783 --> 10:14.482
And Bill O'Reilly once pitched me

10:14.507 --> 10:16.641
a call-in show titled
Late Night Whack Off.

10:16.666 --> 10:18.566
We're just gonna film
it on a soundstage.

10:18.591 --> 10:21.325
Can my actress wife play a
flight attendant or something?

10:21.350 --> 10:23.750
- No!
- Don't blame ya. She sucks.

10:23.775 --> 10:25.775
Just need to be able
to tell her I tried.

10:25.838 --> 10:29.139
I can't believe I'm
boozing with Elon Musk.

10:29.164 --> 10:31.998
It's nice to hang with someone
not trying to cancel me.

10:32.023 --> 10:34.224
People talk about me like I'm Dr. Evil.

10:34.249 --> 10:36.082
But Dr. Evil rules.

10:36.107 --> 10:37.940
And Mini-Me, too!

10:37.965 --> 10:39.865
Shit. Rest in peace, Mini-Me.

10:39.890 --> 10:41.657
I really thought I'd
win the public's love

10:41.682 --> 10:43.014
with my new hyperloop,

10:43.039 --> 10:46.007
but not even a luxury-car
portal for billionaires

10:46.032 --> 10:47.264
could turn my image around.

10:47.289 --> 10:50.124
No matter how hard we
try, we just can't get poor

10:50.149 --> 10:52.382
and therefore ugly people to like us.

10:52.407 --> 10:54.808
- To real friends!
- And Mini-Me!

10:57.158 --> 10:58.758
Who are we getting to direct this

10:58.782 --> 11:00.282
handshake video... Woody Allen,

11:00.307 --> 11:02.473
Bryan Singer, Mario Batali?

11:02.507 --> 11:05.709
I'll film it. I was the visionary
behind Jesse Watters

11:05.734 --> 11:08.568
going down to Chinatown to
mock first-generation immigrants

11:08.593 --> 11:10.760
- who can't quote Tommy Boy.
- Cool!

11:10.785 --> 11:13.445
Now, I'm thinking the troops
come out to their theme song,

11:13.470 --> 11:16.037
which is just the word
"money" 500 times.

11:16.062 --> 11:17.421
Um, that's The Apprentice.

11:17.446 --> 11:20.148
Okay. How 'bout this...
instead of troops,

11:20.173 --> 11:22.773
we bring in tax-evading
sitcom sidekicks,

11:22.798 --> 11:24.331
bald country musicians,

11:24.356 --> 11:26.723
and a young, weeping Piers Morgan.

11:26.748 --> 11:29.648
- Celebrity Apprentice!
- It worked then; it'll work now!

11:29.734 --> 11:32.469
I'd like to get to some
of the stars if I can,

11:32.494 --> 11:34.727
but, if not, maybe
upload my consciousness

11:34.752 --> 11:37.052
into, like, that star...
or even that one.

11:37.077 --> 11:39.478
Elon, this has been the
best night of my life,

11:39.503 --> 11:41.637
and I once saw the Cash Cab drive by.

11:41.790 --> 11:44.457
Hey, do you think my dad would
want one of your hyperloops?

11:44.482 --> 11:45.614
He'd probably prefer it.

11:45.639 --> 11:47.494
Air Force One's toilet flushes scary.

11:47.519 --> 11:48.653
Well, here's the great thing.

11:48.677 --> 11:50.710
You don't need a
toilet on the hyperloop.

11:50.735 --> 11:52.835
You go so fast, your body's only capable

11:52.860 --> 11:55.172
of discharging orgasmic delirium.

11:55.197 --> 11:56.630
But how would we pay for it?

11:56.655 --> 11:59.256
I've been in the red ever
since I went all-in on currency

11:59.281 --> 12:01.073
for a fake country called Abo Dabbo.

12:01.098 --> 12:03.153
Uh, do you think getting
funding from Congress

12:03.178 --> 12:05.379
would be fire or, like, suss?

12:05.404 --> 12:07.904
Good luck getting it
through those vanilla dorks.

12:07.929 --> 12:09.996
They wouldn't even
let my dad build a wall

12:10.021 --> 12:11.854
between refugees and their newborns.

12:11.879 --> 12:14.179
Don't worry. I'm from Silicon Valley.

12:14.204 --> 12:17.005
With a smoke machine,
disorienting house music,

12:17.030 --> 12:20.198
and the unblinking confidence
of a YouTube pickup artist,

12:20.223 --> 12:21.582
anything is possible.

12:22.563 --> 12:25.697
That star's pretty cool.
So many cool stars.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.548
This reminds me of the
good ol' days at Fox News.

12:30.573 --> 12:34.208
I bet Roger Ailes is in heaven
right now, groping down on us.

12:34.233 --> 12:35.699
My brother started Blackwater

12:35.724 --> 12:37.823
and gave me some tips
to get into character...

12:37.848 --> 12:40.712
back straight, chin up,
shoot a few civilians.

12:40.737 --> 12:42.169
Oh, that's a good idea.
We should do that.

12:42.171 --> 12:43.538
I'm late. Whatever.

12:43.563 --> 12:44.829
Go over there and shake

12:44.854 --> 12:46.987
Lieutenant Mnuchin's hand,
please. We're rolling.

12:47.012 --> 12:49.245
Well, wait a second.
I have to shake a hand?

12:49.270 --> 12:50.837
- Jesus fucking hell!
- Ugh!

12:50.862 --> 12:53.162
Fine, fine! Shut up!

12:53.187 --> 12:55.120
And... action!

12:55.222 --> 12:58.123
Wow! Troops! We love the troops!

12:58.148 --> 13:00.849
Oh, no! Enemy attack! I'm so brave!

13:00.874 --> 13:02.941
No other president has ever done this!

13:02.966 --> 13:04.664
I must really love our troops!

13:04.689 --> 13:06.638
We'll fix it in post.

13:06.663 --> 13:09.864
No other president has ever done this!

13:09.889 --> 13:11.922
I must really love our troops!

13:11.947 --> 13:14.747
Okay. I'm going to re-defeat ISIS!

13:20.842 --> 13:22.609
Ahh! That's right, ISIS!

13:23.779 --> 13:25.312
Alright, that's all set.

13:25.337 --> 13:27.570
This handshake has once again proved

13:27.595 --> 13:30.557
our President's undying primordial love

13:30.582 --> 13:31.780
for this country!

13:31.805 --> 13:35.671
Folks, we're having a parade
for him across the entire nation

13:35.696 --> 13:37.596
right now led by me!

13:37.621 --> 13:40.055
Let's go!

13:40.080 --> 13:43.678
Looks like President Chump
has become President Champ.

13:43.703 --> 13:44.998
But instead of

13:45.000 --> 13:48.268
climbing the steps of the
Philadelphia Museum of Art,

13:48.293 --> 13:52.194
like Rocky did, he's climbing
the ranks of best Presidents.

13:55.353 --> 13:56.854
Cory Booker's up there?

13:56.879 --> 14:00.447
That guy's cool as ass! He
wears jeans on the weekends.

14:00.472 --> 14:02.859
Just remember... be as cold and inhuman

14:02.884 --> 14:04.550
as the technology you're selling.

14:04.575 --> 14:05.675
Thanks.

14:06.895 --> 14:08.795
Oh, and, Elon?

14:09.024 --> 14:10.123
Yeah?

14:10.125 --> 14:11.324
Thanks.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.862
I'm here to revolutionize the world

14:16.887 --> 14:19.989
by installing mass
transit for the rest of us.

14:20.014 --> 14:22.414
People who flip out
if the flight attendant

14:22.439 --> 14:25.573
asks us to alter our
behavior in literally any way.

14:25.598 --> 14:27.732
As a resident of Silicon Valley...

14:27.757 --> 14:29.258
- Ooh!
- He lives there.

14:29.282 --> 14:32.049
... I know what it takes
to build this hyperloop

14:32.074 --> 14:34.941
fast, cheap, and with technology.

14:34.966 --> 14:37.667
I've been told technology
is the future of tech!

14:37.692 --> 14:40.065
Here's a normal train
going very slow as ass.

14:40.090 --> 14:41.557
- Boo!
- Boresville!

14:41.581 --> 14:42.955
Where's the technology?

14:42.957 --> 14:45.590
But here is my hyperloop, going so fast!

14:45.615 --> 14:46.747
Look at it go!

14:46.772 --> 14:48.648
It's faster than the slow one!

14:48.673 --> 14:51.074
Hey, Schumer, what's
the most annoying thing

14:51.099 --> 14:52.365
about mass transit?

14:52.390 --> 14:54.423
When loud groups of unruly teenagers

14:54.456 --> 14:56.047
mock my sensible shoes.

14:56.072 --> 14:57.771
We're on our feet all day!

14:57.796 --> 15:00.764
My hyperloop takes the
mass out of mass transit.

15:00.789 --> 15:02.956
It's just you and your car underground.

15:02.981 --> 15:05.177
So it's a car tunnel?

15:05.202 --> 15:06.701
Turn up the fog.

15:06.726 --> 15:09.193
- Ooh!
- Great fog tech!

15:09.218 --> 15:11.685
For a hyperloop from...
and I'm thinking randomly...

15:11.710 --> 15:13.643
Washington, D.C., to Mar-a-Lago,

15:13.668 --> 15:16.570
all I'm asking for is $40 million.

15:16.595 --> 15:18.161
Make it a billion, and you have a deal!

15:20.726 --> 15:24.295
Speech! Speech! Speech!

15:24.297 --> 15:27.064
Bill, we did it. We made it
look like I did it.

15:27.066 --> 15:28.932
How are you this good at optics?

15:28.957 --> 15:31.725
Let's just say... I'm seeing 20/20!

15:31.750 --> 15:33.216
Oh, no.

15:33.241 --> 15:36.342
Shut the hell up until I get it!

15:36.537 --> 15:38.071
Hey, everyone.

15:38.096 --> 15:41.365
My wife bought me a Sony Mini-DCR HC26

15:41.390 --> 15:44.658
a couple Christmases ago, so
I caught some fun bloopers.

15:44.683 --> 15:45.749
Enjoy.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.487
Uh-oh. Here we go.

15:50.423 --> 15:51.855
Thank you for your shervish.

15:51.857 --> 15:53.156
- Shervish?!
- Wait, wait.

15:54.694 --> 15:56.359
He said what?!

15:56.361 --> 15:58.261
Thank you for your service.

15:58.263 --> 15:59.562
Oh, my God!

15:59.564 --> 16:01.331
Oh, my God! Call an ambulance!

16:01.356 --> 16:03.322
Oh, no.

16:03.347 --> 16:05.247
Where is Mnuchin, anyway?

16:05.272 --> 16:07.439
God. I don't even know
why I'm doing this.

16:07.464 --> 16:09.897
I genuinely hate the troops.

16:09.922 --> 16:11.422
You shouldn't laugh at that!

16:11.447 --> 16:13.747
Honestly, it should
turn your blood cold.

16:13.772 --> 16:17.608
Because I am serious. I
absolutely hate the troops!

16:19.251 --> 16:20.484
Pompeo Productions.

16:22.723 --> 16:24.754
Wow. I'm glad you guys like it.

16:24.779 --> 16:27.046
I was nervous when I
posted it on YouTube.

16:29.628 --> 16:33.528
I can feel everyone's mad at me,
but, again, I don't know why.

16:38.659 --> 16:40.760
I'm Wolf Blitzer, and every morning

16:40.785 --> 16:43.736
I wake up in a suit, unsure
how it got on my body.

16:43.761 --> 16:45.041
According to a blooper reel

16:45.066 --> 16:48.434
posted by YouTube user
"CoolSecretAgent63",

16:48.459 --> 16:51.894
the footage of Trump shaking
the hand of troops was staged.

16:51.919 --> 16:54.153
Joining me now, a man whose
brain makes him stutter

16:54.178 --> 16:56.845
out of sheer self-preservation,
Rudy Giuliani.

16:56.870 --> 16:59.203
Is it true the troops are so insulted

16:59.228 --> 17:01.428
that they no longer want
the president to visit?

17:01.453 --> 17:02.954
Now, let me stop you right there, Shep.

17:02.978 --> 17:05.913
Clearly, Donald Trump didn't
shake the hand of a real soldier

17:05.938 --> 17:08.535
because he's too lazy to
fly to the Middle East.

17:08.560 --> 17:11.327
Uh-oh! Maybe if I say
the same thing backwards,

17:11.352 --> 17:12.984
it's like clicking "undo".

17:14.344 --> 17:16.511
- I'm so sorry, sir.
- Sorry?

17:16.536 --> 17:18.303
The troops found out the video's fake,

17:18.328 --> 17:21.162
and now they hate me so much
they don't want me to visit?

17:21.186 --> 17:24.588
Shine, you did it! Whoo!

17:24.613 --> 17:27.526
So, if we convert my dad's
bed into the elevator,

17:27.550 --> 17:30.385
he could ride his mattress
all the way to Mar-a-Lago!

17:30.410 --> 17:31.877
Where's the power source?

17:31.902 --> 17:34.268
Ugh! All this thinking
has sobered me up.

17:34.293 --> 17:35.459
Want to go to Bringo's?

17:35.484 --> 17:37.118
It's eleven-dollar Coors' night!

17:37.143 --> 17:39.309
Uh, how 'bout you go
and I'll meet you there?

17:39.334 --> 17:41.634
Sometimes a genius needs
to work alone, you know?

17:41.659 --> 17:43.693
What's the point of being a genius

17:43.718 --> 17:45.884
if you don't have a best
friend to share it with?

17:45.909 --> 17:48.343
What's Albert without Einstein?

17:48.368 --> 17:52.070
Yeah, man, go for it.
Whatever you need. I'm good.

17:52.095 --> 17:53.662
I'm heading to Mar-a-Lago

17:53.686 --> 17:55.152
for some well-earned me time.

17:55.177 --> 17:58.338
If Melania asks where I am...
Oh, who am I kidding?

17:58.363 --> 17:59.928
Hey, where's the salute-y guy?

17:59.953 --> 18:01.153
You mean the Marine?

18:01.178 --> 18:03.695
He went AWOL when he
saw that blooper reel.

18:03.720 --> 18:06.124
Well, one more arm lift
I don't have to do today.

18:06.149 --> 18:08.183
Also, your pilots went AWOL, too.

18:08.208 --> 18:10.575
Some people just don't
have the personal fortitude

18:10.600 --> 18:12.233
to work for people they hate.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.792
So, you're saying I have to...

18:14.817 --> 18:16.683
walk?

18:18.767 --> 18:20.834
I'd rather ride in a shitty hatchback

18:20.836 --> 18:22.269
with Satan himself!

18:22.271 --> 18:24.537
Did someone say hatchback?

18:24.562 --> 18:27.397
All aboard the S.S. S.S.!

18:28.737 --> 18:32.605
Ugh! Elon is six hours late.
My Coors is piping-hot now!

18:33.584 --> 18:35.761
Merging technology and government

18:35.786 --> 18:38.253
is an important step Congress must take.

18:38.278 --> 18:40.478
Today, Elon Musk's hyperloop.

18:40.503 --> 18:42.569
Tomorrow, functional voting machines

18:42.594 --> 18:44.523
that don't collapse when
you close the curtain.

18:44.548 --> 18:47.183
This hyperloop will have serious BDE,

18:47.208 --> 18:49.809
which, of course, stands
for Big Dick Energy.

18:49.834 --> 18:52.234
- Yeah. Uh-oh. I said it.
- Can you turn this off?

18:52.259 --> 18:53.959
The hyperloop is gonna
break the Internet.

18:53.984 --> 18:55.137
What does the fox say?

18:55.162 --> 18:56.828
He says, "Anyone who
doubts the hyperloop

18:56.853 --> 18:58.352
can cash me outside, how 'bout dah!"

18:58.377 --> 18:59.677
Can you turn this off, please?

18:59.702 --> 19:02.151
Hey... What? Just wanted
to take another look

19:02.176 --> 19:04.043
- at this hyperloop.
- Turn it off, please!

19:04.045 --> 19:07.479
Let me tell you guys, the
hyperloop will be lit A-F.

19:07.481 --> 19:09.916
- Hyperloop, Felicia!
- Please turn it off!

19:09.918 --> 19:13.886
I've always dreamed we'd
drive south together, doing 90,

19:13.888 --> 19:16.880
tailgating some Hispanic
family road-tripping to Disney.

19:16.905 --> 19:18.973
Can't we just put on the radio?

19:18.998 --> 19:21.664
How about the one CD
that's stuck in there?

19:25.282 --> 19:27.642
Ah-ah. Don't touch the
knob. It only gets louder.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.359
You have any snacks or anything?

19:29.384 --> 19:32.719
Doritos Nacho Blasters?
Cheetos Nacho Blast 'Ems?

19:32.744 --> 19:35.545
Something even better
than junk food... Soylent!

19:35.570 --> 19:38.872
All your daily vitamins
in one thick lurid cream.

19:38.897 --> 19:40.897
How much longer is this gonna be?

19:40.922 --> 19:43.789
This car is sort of the opposite
of that bus from Speed...

19:43.814 --> 19:46.915
once you get over 60,
it immediately blows up.

19:46.940 --> 19:49.507
And that's how I found out
that I'm susceptible to cults

19:49.532 --> 19:51.128
but immune to cyanide capsules.

19:51.153 --> 19:52.853
- Oh, look, we're here.
- Let me out!

19:52.878 --> 19:54.651
Hold on. You have to open
all the doors at once,

19:54.675 --> 19:55.699
or it doesn't work.

19:55.724 --> 19:58.458
Mar-a-Lago. The one place in the world

19:58.483 --> 20:01.517
where I'm welcomed with open,
gold watch-covered arms.

20:04.201 --> 20:08.607
Oh, no! Every board member
is a defense contractor!

20:08.632 --> 20:12.334
Forget the troops!
I pissed off Lockheed Martin!

20:12.359 --> 20:14.287
Lockheed...

20:14.312 --> 20:18.414
M-a-a-a-artin!

20:20.845 --> 20:22.619
Don't feel bad about getting kicked out

20:22.621 --> 20:23.920
of your own country club, sir.

20:23.945 --> 20:26.479
I've been kicked out of
three Red Robins this week

20:26.504 --> 20:27.770
just for scent alone.

20:27.795 --> 20:29.695
Why is it so hot?

20:29.720 --> 20:31.986
I can't turn on the AC without awakening

20:32.011 --> 20:34.912
a nasty colony of hornets
currently breeding in there.

20:34.937 --> 20:38.104
Just. Take me. Back.

20:38.129 --> 20:39.663
- Boo! Boo!
- Troop hater!

20:39.704 --> 20:41.404
Respect the troops!

20:41.429 --> 20:42.728
I hate the people,

20:42.753 --> 20:45.287
but the people aren't
supposed to hate me.

20:45.312 --> 20:47.979
I had military-grade wipers installed

20:48.004 --> 20:49.537
just for these situations.

20:49.562 --> 20:52.095
Comes in handy literally
every moment of my life.

20:52.120 --> 20:54.221
- This button?
- No! That's the AC!

20:55.304 --> 20:57.363
Arm yourself! It's the queen!

20:57.388 --> 20:59.588
Thanks for coming, Jeff Bezos.

20:59.613 --> 21:01.980
I prefer my billionaires
without a full head

21:02.005 --> 21:03.572
of luscious high-tech hair.

21:03.597 --> 21:06.463
I'm glad you called and that
your father put aside our feud

21:06.488 --> 21:08.688
to learn how Amazon is revolutionizing

21:08.713 --> 21:11.180
the way our economy hollows
out the middle class.

21:11.205 --> 21:13.329
Sure. Hey, you know what would be fun?

21:13.354 --> 21:15.888
Doing an Instagram video just for fun.

21:16.039 --> 21:18.840
Hey, Elo... Er, shit. Hey, everybody!

21:18.842 --> 21:21.543
I'm here with my best
billionaire buddy, Jay-zos.

21:21.568 --> 21:24.268
Is Amazon kicking around
any cool innovations?

21:24.293 --> 21:26.727
A flying skateboard?
Really funny glasses?

21:26.752 --> 21:28.318
We're adding low-cost housing

21:28.343 --> 21:30.228
to our intercontinental cargo ships

21:30.253 --> 21:32.253
so Amazon Fulfillment Families can sort

21:32.255 --> 21:34.355
recurring toiletry
orders from the comfort

21:34.357 --> 21:36.024
of their own intermodal containers.

21:36.026 --> 21:38.025
Uck! Why did I think you'd be cool?!

21:38.050 --> 21:41.085
Your claim to fame is delivering
a single tube of toothpaste

21:41.110 --> 21:42.510
in nine pounds of cardboard.

21:42.535 --> 21:43.858
Talk about an understatement.

21:43.883 --> 21:46.215
I won't talk about that, actually!

21:47.382 --> 21:48.903
Those guys had it made.

21:48.927 --> 21:51.728
A beach covered in blood
and guts is still a beach.

21:51.753 --> 21:54.587
There's still time to save
yourself, Mr. President!

21:54.612 --> 21:57.914
Senator Lindsey Graham?
What are you doing here?

21:57.939 --> 22:00.172
I'm always right behind you,

22:00.197 --> 22:03.398
just in case you need something
like a bottle of water,

22:03.423 --> 22:05.924
a folksy saying with racist undertones,

22:05.949 --> 22:07.941
or if you're ever having
trouble with the troops...

22:07.965 --> 22:09.925
- The last one!
- Just go meet 'em.

22:09.950 --> 22:13.322
It's not a sacrifice for you.
It's a sacrifice for them.

22:13.347 --> 22:14.476
They're the ones who gotta climb

22:14.500 --> 22:16.540
out of their bunks at
2 a.m. for a photo op

22:16.565 --> 22:18.765
even though on the ballot
they wrote in "Ron Paul".

22:18.790 --> 22:21.691
But I specifically said I wouldn't go.

22:21.716 --> 22:24.051
How can I betray my principles?

22:24.076 --> 22:27.577
I used to say Donald Trump
was evil human garbage,

22:27.602 --> 22:30.603
but then my best friend
who didn't like me died,

22:30.628 --> 22:33.523
and I needed a new best
friend who didn't like me,

22:33.548 --> 22:34.814
and that's you.

22:36.251 --> 22:37.817
Hey, this is Awesome Chris,

22:37.819 --> 22:39.719
and I'm gonna pour 40 ounces of Patrón

22:39.721 --> 22:41.621
into this helium balloon and swallow it.

22:41.646 --> 22:43.913
I wonder if Awesome
Chris would be my friend.

22:43.938 --> 22:46.501
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

22:46.526 --> 22:48.060
Shouldn't you be with Cory Booker

22:48.062 --> 22:49.296
and his cool weekend jeans?

22:49.321 --> 22:52.555
Eh. Seeing you with another
pursed lipped billionaire

22:52.580 --> 22:54.280
made me miss our laughs.

22:55.541 --> 22:58.237
Remember when we yelled at
that waitress for being old,

22:58.239 --> 23:00.005
and she heard us and frowned?

23:00.007 --> 23:01.907
I never meant to use you.

23:01.932 --> 23:04.166
I just saw an opportunity
to leverage our friendship

23:04.191 --> 23:06.633
for financial and political
gain, and I took it.

23:06.658 --> 23:08.492
You should've just told me that!

23:08.517 --> 23:10.750
I heard your father
needs to get to Iraq.

23:10.775 --> 23:13.042
I could sure use some
help building a hyperloop.

23:13.067 --> 23:15.567
But Iraq is a hundreds of miles away.

23:15.592 --> 23:18.593
Once you get into the ground,
every point is equidistant.

23:18.618 --> 23:22.087
Equi-what?! You are a genius!

23:22.196 --> 23:24.229
Tesla Motors.

23:25.932 --> 23:29.501
The future is affluent.

23:29.503 --> 23:33.104

23:33.106 --> 23:35.239

23:58.331 --> 23:59.904
Friends, family,

23:59.929 --> 24:01.865
the millions of people
who wanted to be here

24:01.867 --> 24:04.168
but had to pick up a
friend from the airport,

24:04.170 --> 24:06.370
today, I head to the Middle East

24:06.372 --> 24:09.481
to shake the hand of a
United States soldier.

24:09.506 --> 24:10.838
When will I return?

24:10.863 --> 24:13.370
No one knows, but
probably later tonight.

24:13.395 --> 24:14.752
Lindsey, if I don't make it back,

24:14.777 --> 24:16.247
I give you permission to become

24:16.249 --> 24:18.441
an engorged leech upon Mitt Romney.

24:18.466 --> 24:21.966
Thank you, Mr. President.
Give that hand hell!

24:23.005 --> 24:24.871
Oh, shit, no pilot.

24:24.896 --> 24:27.331
The military still hates
me for hating them!

24:27.356 --> 24:28.655
Handshake is canceled.

24:28.680 --> 24:30.822
Should we just blow up
America and start over?

24:30.847 --> 24:34.415
Dad! Wait! I made a friend.

24:34.440 --> 24:36.340
Don, this isn't a time for jokes.

24:36.365 --> 24:39.166
I'm serious! He has this
tube, and you get in,

24:39.191 --> 24:40.690
and it's a car, and then you...

24:40.715 --> 24:42.315
He can explain it better than me,

24:42.341 --> 24:45.542
but you go right to Iraq in,
like, ten minutes or something.

24:50.082 --> 24:53.455
Don't worry, Mr. President.
We worked out all the kinks.

24:53.480 --> 24:54.645
Who's "we"?

24:54.670 --> 24:56.571
Oh, me and your son Don Jr.

24:56.596 --> 24:57.961
Oh, this will not work.

24:57.986 --> 25:01.255
Relax. I know what I'm doing.
I'm from Silicon Vall...

25:05.001 --> 25:07.635
Wh-Wha... What happened?

25:07.660 --> 25:09.927
You blew up, Dad! It was awesome!

25:09.952 --> 25:11.085
And Elon Musk?

25:11.110 --> 25:12.709
He died doing what he loved...

25:12.734 --> 25:16.069
spending lots of money to
explode a thing nobody wanted.

25:16.094 --> 25:19.015
And he'll get to die again, someday.

25:19.040 --> 25:20.773
Elon! You're back!

25:20.798 --> 25:23.432
Well, I downloaded my
personality from the cloud

25:23.457 --> 25:25.490
into a genetically altered corpse.

25:25.515 --> 25:28.817
I won't give any more details
because they're a tad immoral.

25:28.842 --> 25:32.510
Dad, you got wounded while
trying to visit a combat zone!

25:32.535 --> 25:34.035
You're a hero!

25:37.786 --> 25:40.515
And so I stand here in...

25:41.647 --> 25:43.666
Doggy Bag, Iraq...

25:43.668 --> 25:46.168
to shake the hand of the brave citizen

25:46.170 --> 25:50.572
who injured himself on his
way to the line of duty... me.

25:52.070 --> 25:54.505
I encourage the men who serve

25:54.530 --> 25:57.730
and women who abandoned
their gender to serve

25:57.755 --> 26:01.157
to take their own hand and
shake the hell out of it.

26:01.182 --> 26:02.948
Lord knows I'm not gonna.

26:02.973 --> 26:04.340
Y'all nasty!

26:04.365 --> 26:07.098
- Can we go back to bed?
- Ron Paul revolution!

26:07.123 --> 26:10.012
And that was the President
earlier today in Iraq,

26:10.037 --> 26:11.671
giving us the inspiration

26:11.696 --> 26:14.830
for another installment
of President Chump...

26:14.855 --> 26:18.190
who, after his injury, could
receive a Purple Heart.

26:18.215 --> 26:21.315
All he needs is a brain
and some courage,

26:21.340 --> 26:25.543
and he'll be the wizard
of Washington, D.C.

26:25.568 --> 26:28.101
Those are always fun.

26:28.189 --> 26:30.456
Now on to the looming nuclear war

26:30.481 --> 26:32.315
between India and Pakistan.
