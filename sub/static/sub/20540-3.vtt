00:40.400 --> 00:43.667
- Welcome welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight."

00:43.667 --> 00:45.000
I'm John Oliver.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.767
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:46.767 --> 00:50.033
And unfor--
unfortunately, we must begin,

00:50.033 --> 00:52.333
again, with President Trump,

00:52.333 --> 00:55.100
two words that continue
to sound unnatural together,

00:55.100 --> 00:56.667
like walrus porn

00:56.667 --> 00:58.734
or Tilda Swinton.

00:58.734 --> 01:00.667
Now, on Tuesday, Trump visited

01:00.667 --> 01:02.900
the Museum of African American
History and Culture,

01:02.900 --> 01:04.767
promising to unite
a divided country.

01:04.767 --> 01:06.200
And if you didn't
hear about that,

01:06.200 --> 01:09.066
it's probably because
it happened on the very same day

01:09.066 --> 01:10.600
he did this.

01:10.600 --> 01:11.667
- The Trump administration

01:11.667 --> 01:13.033
this morning laying out plans

01:13.033 --> 01:15.967
to aggressively crack down
on illegal immigration,

01:15.967 --> 01:19.233
potentially sparking a steep
increase in deportations

01:19.233 --> 01:22.266
and stoking fears among
immigrant communities.

01:22.266 --> 01:23.533
- Okay, so that's upsetting

01:23.533 --> 01:25.100
even by Donald Trump's
standards,

01:25.100 --> 01:27.900
because normally, when he wants
to terrify an immigrant,

01:27.900 --> 01:29.433
he just texts Melania,

01:29.433 --> 01:30.533
"Coming home early.

01:30.533 --> 01:32.133
Feeling horny."

01:32.133 --> 01:35.000
Now--now, this new plan gives

01:35.000 --> 01:37.467
ICE agents much greater latitude

01:37.467 --> 01:39.333
in who they can
pursue and deport,

01:39.333 --> 01:42.433
and it includes hiring
15,000 new border patrol

01:42.433 --> 01:43.533
and immigration officers,

01:43.533 --> 01:45.033
which might actually
be difficult,

01:45.033 --> 01:46.934
as they've already had
so much trouble

01:46.934 --> 01:48.166
finding qualified applicants,

01:48.166 --> 01:50.767
there are currently
around 2,000 vacancies.

01:50.767 --> 01:52.567
It seems immigration agent

01:52.567 --> 01:54.767
is the hardest job to fill,

01:54.767 --> 01:58.400
right after "personal assistant
to Mariah Carey."

01:58.400 --> 01:59.700
"I want a limo for my dog

01:59.700 --> 02:02.333
"and mirrors that make me look

02:02.333 --> 02:04.300
Go get me them."

02:04.300 --> 02:07.467
Now, many people were alarmed
by the new guidelines,

02:07.467 --> 02:09.300
and it frankly didn't help
when the president seemed

02:09.300 --> 02:12.066
to escalate the stakes
out of nowhere.

02:12.066 --> 02:15.533
- We're getting really bad dudes
out of this country

02:15.533 --> 02:19.266
and at a rate that nobody's
ever seen before.

02:19.266 --> 02:21.400
And they're the bad ones.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.700
And it's a military operation.

02:23.700 --> 02:25.433
- Okay, okay, first,

02:25.433 --> 02:28.066
please stop using the phrase
"bad dudes."

02:28.066 --> 02:29.233
Please.

02:29.233 --> 02:31.533
I understand that you're
trying to wean yourself off

02:31.533 --> 02:32.700
"bad hombres,"

02:32.700 --> 02:34.734
but it still feels like
a lateral move.

02:34.734 --> 02:35.900
But more importantly,

02:35.900 --> 02:39.033
what was that you said about
a military operation?

02:39.033 --> 02:40.967
That is a casual way to mention

02:40.967 --> 02:43.033
that you've deployed
the armed forces.

02:43.033 --> 02:45.500
And luckily for everyone,
Emmy-winning actress

02:45.500 --> 02:47.066
Melissa McCarthy was on hand

02:47.066 --> 02:49.133
to set the record straight,

02:49.133 --> 02:53.400
with the world's least
convincing explanation.

02:53.400 --> 02:55.367
- The president was using that
as an adjective.

02:55.367 --> 02:56.867
It's happening with precision.

02:56.867 --> 03:00.500
- Okay, Mel, but presidents
really need to be

03:00.500 --> 03:01.700
precise with language.

03:01.700 --> 03:03.166
When you're the commander
in chief,

03:03.166 --> 03:05.667
the term "military operation"
has consequences.

03:05.667 --> 03:08.533
It's not just a meaningless word
you can throw around,

03:08.533 --> 03:11.000
like "consultant"
or "superfood."

03:11.000 --> 03:14.367
But please--please, please,
don't think that Trump

03:14.367 --> 03:16.333
just went after immigrants
this week,

03:16.333 --> 03:19.033
because he targeted
children too.

03:19.033 --> 03:21.133
- Schools and students are
facing uncertainty today

03:21.133 --> 03:24.266
after the Trump administration
withdrew federal guidance

03:24.266 --> 03:27.200
on transgender bathroom use
in public schools.

03:27.200 --> 03:30.033
- Yes, it seems one by one,
Trump is delivering

03:30.033 --> 03:32.433
on his promise to
"Make entire subsets

03:32.433 --> 03:35.100

03:39.100 --> 03:43.233
But this is gratuitous
in so many ways.

03:43.233 --> 03:45.600
The guidelines had already been
suspended last summer,

03:45.600 --> 03:46.867
and there's a Supreme Court case

03:46.867 --> 03:48.400
that may settle many
of these issues,

03:48.400 --> 03:50.600
on top of which,
all the guidelines recommended

03:50.600 --> 03:52.400
was that students
be called by their

03:52.400 --> 03:53.834
preferred name and pronoun,

03:53.834 --> 03:55.700
be allowed to use
the restrooms and locker rooms

03:55.700 --> 03:57.166
consistent with their
gender identity,

03:57.166 --> 03:58.867
and, regardless of gender,

03:58.867 --> 04:02.300
be able to wear a tux to prom
or a dress in yearbook photos,

04:02.300 --> 04:04.066
which is a good rule.

04:04.066 --> 04:06.033
If the government wants to
address an actual problem

04:06.033 --> 04:07.033

04:07.033 --> 04:09.900
maybe ban quotes

Oh, really, Dylan?

04:11.233 --> 04:13.166
You've got so much to say?

04:13.166 --> 04:16.533
Evidence is stacking up
to the contrary.

04:16.533 --> 04:19.300
And look, as we've discussed
before on this show,

04:19.300 --> 04:21.734
anti-transgender rules
like bathroom bills

04:21.734 --> 04:24.600
are almost always rooted in
deep sexual fear-mongering:

04:24.600 --> 04:27.000
the idea that they would
provide cover for predators

04:27.000 --> 04:29.100
to sneak into ladies'
locker rooms,

04:29.100 --> 04:31.567
despite the fact there is
virtually no evidence

04:31.567 --> 04:32.934
of that happening.

04:32.934 --> 04:34.533
What there are reports of

04:34.533 --> 04:38.533
are of Trump himself barging in
on women and teenagers

- Yeah.

05:04.533 --> 05:07.767
- Yeah, you do seem to sort of
get away with it,

05:07.767 --> 05:08.934
which is exactly why,

05:08.934 --> 05:11.300
if we really want to protect
women from predators,

05:11.300 --> 05:13.600
let's stop wasting our time
with pointless,

05:13.600 --> 05:15.000

05:15.000 --> 05:17.600

a "military operation"

05:17.600 --> 05:22.667

from women's rooms nationwide.

06:32.567 --> 06:35.600
Our main story tonight is
the Affordable Care Act,

06:35.600 --> 06:37.166
also known as Obamacare,

06:37.166 --> 06:39.967
or in emails from your uncle
as, "Forward, forward, forward,

06:39.967 --> 06:43.333
the Communist takeover
of American values."

06:43.333 --> 06:45.000
For years now,
Obamacare has been

06:45.000 --> 06:47.600
the bane of Republicans'
existence.

06:47.600 --> 06:50.367
- If Obamacare is ever
implemented and enforced,

06:50.367 --> 06:53.533
we will never recover from it.

06:53.533 --> 06:55.867
- This bill is an affront
on the moral--

06:55.867 --> 06:59.367
morality of the provision
of American health care.

06:59.367 --> 07:03.100
- Obamacare is the worst piece
of legislation ever.

07:03.100 --> 07:06.367
- Yes, the worst piece
of legislation ever.

07:06.367 --> 07:08.400
So good news,
Fugitive Slave Act.

07:08.400 --> 07:11.133
You're finally off the hook!

07:11.133 --> 07:13.900
But now, with--with Republicans
controlling both

07:13.900 --> 07:15.300
the White House and Congress,

07:15.300 --> 07:17.266
they've gone from talking about
repealing Obamacare

07:17.266 --> 07:19.166
to potentially being
able to do it.

07:19.166 --> 07:21.667
Already, the House and Senate
have passed budget resolutions

07:21.667 --> 07:22.867
to start the process,

07:22.867 --> 07:26.533
and at least one member is
positively giddy about it.

07:26.533 --> 07:27.834
- A little over six years ago,

07:27.834 --> 07:29.600
I lived in
a pretty decent house.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.367
And one day I heard a knock
on the door.

07:31.367 --> 07:32.600
And before I knew it,

07:32.600 --> 07:34.500
my colleagues from
the other side of the aisle

07:34.500 --> 07:36.600
had let a goat loose
in my house.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.934
Now, for six years,
that goat has been messing in

07:38.934 --> 07:40.533
and destroying my house.

07:40.533 --> 07:43.033
I want to renovate my house,
but before I can,

07:43.033 --> 07:44.500
I have to get the goat
out of the house

07:44.500 --> 07:46.433
before it does any more damage.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.900
It makes no sense to start
fixing up my house

07:48.900 --> 07:50.600
until we get the goat out.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.233
Voting for the fiscal year '17
budget resolution

07:53.233 --> 07:55.467
gets this goat out of my house.

07:55.467 --> 07:57.734
- That is so specific,

07:57.734 --> 08:01.800
there is just no way that goat
incident didn't actually happen.

08:01.800 --> 08:03.734
I bet he brings it up
all the time.

08:03.734 --> 08:07.033
"Mr. Speaker, NAFTA is like when
you're half-asleep one morning;

08:07.033 --> 08:09.000
"you put your arm around what
you think is your wife,

08:09.000 --> 08:11.767
"but lo and behold,
it's that goat again.

08:11.767 --> 08:14.400
"And you wonder, why is it
wearing my wife's perfume?

08:14.400 --> 08:18.533
Get this goat out
of my house, y'all!"

08:18.533 --> 08:20.333
And yet, all week long,

08:20.333 --> 08:22.834
Republicans have been dealing
with an unexpected problem:

08:22.834 --> 08:24.467
constituents at town halls

08:24.467 --> 08:27.567
furious that Obamacare
might be taken away.

08:27.567 --> 08:31.033
- I can tell you three members
of my family, including me,

08:31.033 --> 08:33.233
that would be dead.

08:33.233 --> 08:36.200
Dead and homeless...

08:36.200 --> 08:40.200
if it was not for ACA.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.500
[cheers and applause]

08:41.500 --> 08:42.734
- Yes.

08:42.734 --> 08:45.767
Apparently, that annoying
Obamacare "goat in the house"

08:45.767 --> 08:47.867
turned out to be
a licensed physician

08:47.867 --> 08:49.700
who's been saving lives,

08:49.700 --> 08:52.967
and a lot of people do not
want her to go anywhere.

08:52.967 --> 08:54.233
And yes, I said "her."

08:54.233 --> 08:57.767
Oh, I'm sorry, you assumed
that goat doctor was a man?

08:57.767 --> 08:59.233
What the fuck is wrong with you?

08:59.233 --> 09:01.300
#LadyGoatsCanBeDoctors.

09:01.300 --> 09:03.233
#Feminism.

09:03.233 --> 09:07.266
And look, that tone is
actually a big shift,

09:07.266 --> 09:09.567
because if you remember
eight years ago,

09:09.567 --> 09:13.333
people were absolutely terrified
about what Obamacare might mean.

09:13.333 --> 09:15.967
- This is the stepping stone
for com--

09:15.967 --> 09:17.734
for a takeover like communism--

09:17.734 --> 09:19.266
like Hitler did in Germany.

09:19.266 --> 09:21.467
- Obama's a Marxist socialist.

09:21.467 --> 09:24.033
- No!
Don't do this to us!

09:24.033 --> 09:25.633
- You dirty thieves!

09:25.633 --> 09:27.266
- You want to kill
my grandparents,

09:27.266 --> 09:29.033
you come through me first!

09:29.033 --> 09:30.700
- Look, relax.

09:30.700 --> 09:33.734
President Obama did not want to
kill that guy's grandparents.

09:33.734 --> 09:36.200
And if he did, he wouldn't have
used health insurance.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.633
He'd have just ordered
a drone strike

09:37.633 --> 09:39.467
and then declared them
enemy combatants.

09:39.467 --> 09:41.266
That was his style.

09:41.266 --> 09:44.567
So tonight,
let's look at Obamacare:

09:44.567 --> 09:46.333
what it does, what needs fixing,

09:46.333 --> 09:48.000
and how Republicans plan
to replace it.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.867
And before we start,
it's worth remembering

09:49.867 --> 09:53.066
just how bad things were
before it was passed.

09:53.066 --> 09:56.000
Nearly 49 million Americans
had no coverage,

09:56.000 --> 09:57.333
and if you were buying
for yourself,

09:57.333 --> 09:59.800
insurers could deny anyone
they considered too risky.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.967
Some denied entire professions,
like air traffic controllers,

10:02.967 --> 10:05.400
taxi cab drivers,
and scuba divers.

10:05.400 --> 10:09.000
And this baby was denied
coverage at just four months old

10:09.000 --> 10:12.066
for an unexpected
preexisting condition.

10:12.066 --> 10:14.800
- His parents decided to apply
for individual health coverage

10:14.800 --> 10:17.967
for Alex,
but they were turned down--

10:17.967 --> 10:19.200
not because of his age,

10:19.200 --> 10:22.166
but because he was too fat.

10:22.166 --> 10:23.867
- Am I supposed to put
my child on a diet?

10:23.867 --> 10:25.867
Put him on a treadmill?
Of course not.

10:25.867 --> 10:27.200
He's an infant.

10:27.200 --> 10:30.000
- Look, yes, I understand
that you're upset.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.166
But think about it--

10:31.166 --> 10:33.367
he's never going to lose
the weight with that attitude.

10:33.367 --> 10:37.367
But the--the point here is,
Obamacare was an attempt

10:37.367 --> 10:38.667
to solve those problems.

10:38.667 --> 10:40.433
It made it illegal
to deny people coverage,

10:40.433 --> 10:41.767
uh, because of
pre-existing conditions.

10:41.767 --> 10:45.600
Uh, it let people stay on their
parents' plans until age 26.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.633
It made preventive screenings
free for everyone

10:47.633 --> 10:50.333
and created marketplaces where
people could shop for insurance

10:50.333 --> 10:51.600
with potential subsidies.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.166
And between all that
and Medicaid expansion,

10:54.166 --> 10:56.700
more than 20 million people
gained coverage,

10:56.700 --> 10:59.200
putting our uninsured rate
at a historic low.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.333
[cheers and applause]
And yet--and yet--

11:01.333 --> 11:03.767
for many people,
like this woman,

11:03.767 --> 11:05.800
whose treatment for
breast cancer was covered

11:05.800 --> 11:08.767
under Obamacare, the law was
just always too closely

11:08.767 --> 11:11.800
associated with the man
responsible for it.

11:11.800 --> 11:18.100
- I absolutely detest hearing
the words Obamacare.

11:18.100 --> 11:19.734
- [unintelligible]
- Detest it!

11:19.734 --> 11:22.567
It just should have
been given...

11:22.567 --> 11:24.200
a more proper name.

11:24.200 --> 11:27.300
Why be named after
our president?

11:27.300 --> 11:30.000
- Okay, well, to be clear,
it did have a proper name.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.400
It was the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.934
But that does go to show you

11:33.934 --> 11:35.734
it matters what people
call something.

11:35.734 --> 11:37.600
Would Emma Stone be as popular

11:37.600 --> 11:40.400
if her real name was
Blump Shartcracker?

11:40.400 --> 11:42.467
No, no, so it's--

11:42.467 --> 11:44.567
that's--that's why it's good
that she changed it.

11:44.567 --> 11:47.367
And some of
the early accusations

11:47.367 --> 11:49.433
hurled against Obamacare
still linger.

11:49.433 --> 11:51.100
Just this month,
a Republican official,

11:51.100 --> 11:55.533
Bill Akins in Florida, threw out
this classic at a town hall.

11:55.533 --> 11:56.967
- Here's the problems I have

11:56.967 --> 11:58.200
with the Affordable
Health Care Act.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.600
Number one, there is
a provision in there

12:00.600 --> 12:04.367
that anyone over the age of 74

12:04.367 --> 12:08.333
has to go before what is
effectively a death panel.

12:08.333 --> 12:10.533
[indistinct shouting]
Yes, they do.

12:10.533 --> 12:11.967
Yes, they do.

12:11.967 --> 12:13.300
It's in there, folks.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.467
You're wrong.

12:14.467 --> 12:17.533
[indistinct shouting]
- Liar!

12:17.533 --> 12:20.300
- Okay, children.
All right, children.

12:20.300 --> 12:23.600
[indistinct shouting]

12:23.600 --> 12:25.233
It is a death panel.

12:25.233 --> 12:28.834
Who here has read
the Affordable Health Care Plan?

12:28.834 --> 12:30.533
I seriously doubt that.

12:30.533 --> 12:34.000
- What the fuck are you
talking about?

12:34.000 --> 12:37.066
The notion of "death panels"
isn't just a lie,

12:37.066 --> 12:40.567
it's PolitiFact's 2009
"Lie of the Year,"

12:40.567 --> 12:43.200
which is impressive,
considering that in 2009,

12:43.200 --> 12:44.600
America was also repeatedly told

12:44.600 --> 12:47.266
Jason Mraz was
the next big thing.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.967
We were lied to
in a big way there.

12:49.967 --> 12:53.100
And look,
Obamacare is not perfect.

12:53.100 --> 12:55.667
It had, and has,
serious flaws.

12:55.667 --> 12:58.166
The Healthcare.gov website
was broken on day one,

12:58.166 --> 13:02.300
and the president famously made
a very misleading promise.

13:02.300 --> 13:04.100
- If you like your doctor,

13:04.100 --> 13:06.834
you will be able to keep
your doctor, period.

13:06.834 --> 13:08.767
If you like your
health care plan,

13:08.767 --> 13:11.900
you'll be able to keep your
health care plan...

13:11.900 --> 13:12.867
period.

13:12.867 --> 13:15.500
- The truth is,
no one can promise that.

13:15.500 --> 13:16.867
Insurers drop policies

13:16.867 --> 13:18.734
and doctors change networks
all the time.

13:18.734 --> 13:21.934
That is as empty a promise as
a father telling his daughter,

13:21.934 --> 13:24.633
"I will always keep you safe,
period."

13:24.633 --> 13:26.967
Really, Dad?
What about bees?

13:26.967 --> 13:29.867
What about angry swarms of bees?

13:29.867 --> 13:32.133
Be honest and say,
"I'll try to keep you safe,

13:32.133 --> 13:35.667
but these bees are
not fuckin' around."

13:35.667 --> 13:38.100
And there've been
practical problems, too.

13:38.100 --> 13:40.133
Some plans have deductibles
so high,

13:40.133 --> 13:41.500
they're essentially unusable.

13:41.500 --> 13:44.166
And in many places,
premiums have increased sharply,

13:44.166 --> 13:45.867
and some insurers
have dropped out,

13:45.867 --> 13:49.800
although that was partly thanks
to Republicans gutting a program

13:49.800 --> 13:51.900
in the original bill that
helped protect insurers

13:51.900 --> 13:53.367
from unexpected losses.

13:53.367 --> 13:55.233
And that has been something
of a pattern here.

13:55.233 --> 13:57.400
Republicans have happily
complained about the flaws

13:57.400 --> 13:58.367
in the law,

13:58.367 --> 14:00.767
taken no responsibility
for fixing them,

14:00.767 --> 14:03.800
and in fact have often
undermined the whole thing.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.333
But that time is now over.

14:06.333 --> 14:08.800
It is their turn
to present a plan,

14:08.800 --> 14:10.500
and the clock is ticking.

14:10.500 --> 14:13.700
Insurance companies are deciding
right now whether to even offer

14:13.700 --> 14:15.166
Obamacare plans next year.

14:15.166 --> 14:16.266
But before you panic,

14:16.266 --> 14:17.800
there are ads on TV right now

14:17.800 --> 14:20.467
suggesting the Republicans
have been working on something

14:20.467 --> 14:22.066
pretty special.

14:22.066 --> 14:24.367
- Imagine a new path forward:

14:24.367 --> 14:28.233
health insurance that provides
more choices and better care

14:28.233 --> 14:29.600
at lower costs.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.467
House Republicans have a plan
to get there

14:32.467 --> 14:35.200
without disrupting
existing coverage,

14:35.200 --> 14:38.600
giving your family
the health care it deserves.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.233
- Well, that sounds nice.

14:40.233 --> 14:42.000
But it is a little worrying that

14:42.000 --> 14:43.633
that ad is literally
encouraging you

14:43.633 --> 14:46.533
to "imagine" a better
health care plan.

14:46.533 --> 14:47.700
"Close your eyes.

14:47.700 --> 14:49.967
"Dream of a better way forward.

14:49.967 --> 14:51.300
"Now open your eyes,

14:51.300 --> 14:52.600
"and tell us what
you came up with,

14:52.600 --> 14:55.367
'cause we've got
fucking nothing."

14:55.367 --> 14:57.900
And--and if you think
I'm kidding there,

14:57.900 --> 15:03.033
that ad ends with "learn more
at ABetterHealthCarePlan.com,"

15:03.033 --> 15:06.000
but if you go there,
this is the entire website:

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
a single page with just
two sentences of text

15:09.000 --> 15:11.033
and the fucking ad again.

15:11.033 --> 15:12.333
And if you click on the ad,

15:12.333 --> 15:13.900
it'll send you back
to the website,

15:13.900 --> 15:15.600
and so on, and so on, and so on,

15:15.600 --> 15:17.400
until you don't even want
health care,

15:17.400 --> 15:20.900
because you're begging for
the sweet relief of death.

15:20.900 --> 15:22.667
Every time you get
near something

15:22.667 --> 15:24.133
resembling a Republican plan,

15:24.133 --> 15:26.600
it seems to just recede
into the distance.

15:26.600 --> 15:30.133
In January, Trump said he was
working on one and that it was

15:30.133 --> 15:33.000
"very much formulated down
to the final strokes."

15:33.000 --> 15:34.734
But watch what happened
when Tom Price,

15:34.734 --> 15:36.767
his secretary of Health
and Human Services,

15:36.767 --> 15:39.867
was asked about it
at his confirmation hearing.

15:39.867 --> 15:41.967
- President Trump said
he's working with you

15:41.967 --> 15:44.166
on a replacement plan
for the ACA,

15:44.166 --> 15:46.600
um, which is nearly finished
and will be revealed

15:46.600 --> 15:47.867
after your confirmation.

15:47.867 --> 15:49.433
Is that true?

15:49.433 --> 15:52.367
- It's true that
he said that, yes.

15:52.367 --> 15:54.600
- Ha ha ha,
ha ha ha ha!

15:54.600 --> 15:57.967
It's funny because the president
lies to us all the time

15:57.967 --> 15:59.100
with no repercussions!

15:59.100 --> 16:03.033
That's--I see what the joke
we're laughing at is.

16:03.033 --> 16:04.900
Oh, dear.

16:04.900 --> 16:07.100
If you need any more proof

16:07.100 --> 16:09.133
of how unprepared
Republicans are right now,

16:09.133 --> 16:11.734
let me show you one of
the draft bills they circulated.

16:11.734 --> 16:13.567
It is just seven pages long,

16:13.567 --> 16:16.967
and it ends abruptly with
the word "placeholder."

16:16.967 --> 16:20.033
And one member of Congress
actually tried to spin that

16:20.033 --> 16:21.567
as a positive.

16:21.567 --> 16:23.700
- This placeholder provides
the clearest signal yet

16:23.700 --> 16:26.400
that we're working with patients
and health care groups

16:26.400 --> 16:28.033
to draft language that balances

16:28.033 --> 16:30.667
important health status
protections

16:30.667 --> 16:33.300
with necessary risk
mitigation tools.

16:33.300 --> 16:34.900
- Oh, please.

16:34.900 --> 16:37.066
If your spouse gave you
a birthday card

16:37.066 --> 16:39.834
that said "placeholder,"
that would not be a signal

16:39.834 --> 16:41.367
they're working on
the best language

16:41.367 --> 16:43.100
to express their feelings
for you.

16:43.100 --> 16:44.834
It would signal
they forgot your birthday

16:44.834 --> 16:46.800
because they're fucking Sharon
from the office.

16:46.800 --> 16:50.233
And deep down, I think
you actually know that.

16:50.233 --> 16:53.834
The best sense we currently have
of what Republicans want to do

16:53.834 --> 16:56.500
is from previous plans from
both Price and Paul Ryan

16:56.500 --> 16:59.834
and from these talking points
that Ryan gave out

16:59.834 --> 17:01.367
ahead of
the congressional recess.

17:01.367 --> 17:03.767
You're going to be hearing
a few phrases from this

17:03.767 --> 17:05.433
a lot in the coming months,

17:05.433 --> 17:07.567
so let's take a moment
to understand

17:07.567 --> 17:08.734
what they actually mean.

17:08.734 --> 17:10.300
And let's start with
the big one,

17:10.300 --> 17:12.500
which Ryan has been
talking up a great deal.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.667
- What we believe is
the right way to go,

17:14.667 --> 17:15.867
which is what our plan is,

17:15.867 --> 17:18.133
are refundable tax credits
for people to go--

17:18.133 --> 17:19.867
be able to buy
affordable coverage.

17:19.867 --> 17:22.233
- Yes, "refundable tax credits":

17:22.233 --> 17:24.967
basically, free money to help
pay your premiums,

17:24.967 --> 17:27.200
which is a little surprising
coming from Paul Ryan,

17:27.200 --> 17:29.900
a man who probably tips waiters
by writing on the check,

17:29.900 --> 17:33.533
"Find a job the market has
deemed has more value."

17:33.533 --> 17:37.667
But--but you should know this
document suggests tax credits

17:37.667 --> 17:39.767
would be based on age,
not income,

17:39.767 --> 17:40.900
meaning theoretically,

17:40.900 --> 17:42.900
61-year-old billionaire
Bill Gates

17:42.900 --> 17:45.834
would get a bigger subsidy
than a 27-year-old

17:45.834 --> 17:47.033
making minimum wage.

17:47.033 --> 17:49.200
And Gates clearly does not
need that money.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.800
He'll just blow it
on more $10 haircuts

17:51.800 --> 17:54.033
and orthopedic sweaters.

17:54.033 --> 17:58.400
But the real risk here is
subsidies ending up too small

17:58.400 --> 18:00.100
for those who need them
the most.

18:00.100 --> 18:03.266
Tom Price once proposed a credit
of $1,200

18:03.266 --> 18:06.000
to peoples aged, uh, 18 to 35,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.567
and $3,000 to people 50 and up,

18:08.567 --> 18:10.467
which is roughly
a third the cost

18:10.467 --> 18:13.734
of the most bare-bones plans
on the market today.

18:13.734 --> 18:17.133
A tax credit that small helps
cover your health insurance

18:17.133 --> 18:19.967
the way a thong covers
your dad's ass.

18:19.967 --> 18:22.367
It doesn't, and
there's something that is

18:22.367 --> 18:24.700
fundamentally wrong about that.

18:24.700 --> 18:27.100
Now--now, the next
big term in here

18:27.100 --> 18:29.767
is "health savings accounts,"
or HSAs:

18:29.767 --> 18:31.500
tax-free accounts where
you can save money

18:31.500 --> 18:33.066
to pay for health care costs.

18:33.066 --> 18:35.667
Republicans love these things.

18:35.667 --> 18:39.266
- In your experience,
why do these savings accounts--

18:39.266 --> 18:42.066
why are you pushing
so hard for them?

18:42.066 --> 18:43.800
Why do you think
they're effective?

18:43.800 --> 18:46.033
- Because you're spending
your own money

18:46.033 --> 18:47.767
as opposed to someone else's.

18:47.767 --> 18:51.133
It is like when my daughter goes
to the mall with my credit card

18:51.133 --> 18:53.900
or when I go to the mall
with my credit card.

18:53.900 --> 18:57.433
Our purchases come back
quite different.

18:57.433 --> 18:59.233
- Okay, setting aside
that health care

18:59.233 --> 19:00.900
is nothing like
shopping at the mall,

19:00.900 --> 19:02.700
shouldn't you come back
with different purchases

19:02.700 --> 19:06.367
than your daughter regardless
of whose credit card you have?

19:06.367 --> 19:08.767
If you came back from the mall
with a tongue ring,

19:08.767 --> 19:10.400
a bottle of manic panic
hair dye,

19:10.400 --> 19:12.667
and a "Yas Queen" crop top,

19:12.667 --> 19:14.367
it would raise
a lot of questions

19:14.367 --> 19:16.800
having nothing to do
with health care.

19:16.800 --> 19:20.934
Now, the key problem with HSAs
should be obvious here.

19:20.934 --> 19:22.233
They're great for rich people.

19:22.233 --> 19:23.700
They're basically a tax shelter.

19:23.700 --> 19:24.934
But if you're too poor to save

19:24.934 --> 19:28.133
or you get sick enough to blow
through what you've saved,

19:28.133 --> 19:29.900
you're not going to be covered,

19:29.900 --> 19:32.633
and you have that
thong problem again.

19:32.633 --> 19:34.467
And people seem
to understand that.

19:34.467 --> 19:35.700
Just listen to the reaction

19:35.700 --> 19:38.667
when Joni Ernst tried bringing
them up at a town hall.

19:41.767 --> 19:45.133
- No, no!
[indistinct shouting and booing]

19:49.934 --> 19:52.433
- That is
an appropriate reaction

19:52.433 --> 19:55.233
when your problem is,
"I don't have enough money"

19:55.233 --> 19:56.433
and the proposed solution is,

19:56.433 --> 20:00.166
"Well, if you ever do, here's
a very fancy piggy bank."

20:00.166 --> 20:03.867
So--so let's move on to another
key idea: block grants,

20:03.867 --> 20:05.967
a phrase perfectly designed
to bore you,

20:05.967 --> 20:09.066
'cause it combines block,
the most nothing shape,

20:09.066 --> 20:12.934
with Grant, your co-worker's
nothing boyfriend.

20:12.934 --> 20:14.600
"I don't believe we've met."

20:14.600 --> 20:19.166
"Yes, we have, six times.
I'm Grant."

20:19.166 --> 20:22.433
Paul Ryan wants to use
block grants to fund Medicaid,

20:22.433 --> 20:24.867
which largely provides health
care to the poorest Americans.

20:24.867 --> 20:27.533
Basically, he wants to stop
guaranteeing to pay each state

20:27.533 --> 20:29.834
a percentage of
their Medicaid costs

20:29.834 --> 20:33.100
and instead just send them
a fixed block of money.

20:33.100 --> 20:35.300
But if costs start to rise

20:35.300 --> 20:38.667
and the block grant doesn't
keep pace, guess what?

20:38.667 --> 20:40.266
It's that thong.

20:40.266 --> 20:42.867
Thong, thong, thong,
thong, thong.

20:42.867 --> 20:45.867
And--and you should know,
a few years ago,

20:45.867 --> 20:48.767
Ryan proposed a block-grant
program that a study estimated

20:48.767 --> 20:52.533
could kick as many as
20.5 million people off Medicaid

20:52.533 --> 20:54.266
over a decade.

20:54.266 --> 20:56.300
That's a kind of evil
so chillingly banal,

20:56.300 --> 20:57.967
you just don't see it coming.

20:57.967 --> 21:01.166
It's like if you found out that
Grant was a serial killer.

21:01.166 --> 21:02.834
"I kill in plain sight,

21:02.834 --> 21:04.700
"for none can remember my face.

21:04.700 --> 21:05.967
"I am Grant.

21:05.967 --> 21:09.700
We've now met seven times."

21:09.700 --> 21:11.233
But now let's move on

21:11.233 --> 21:13.166
to the final big
talking point here,

21:13.166 --> 21:15.533
and I'll let Paul Ryan explain.

21:15.533 --> 21:17.600
- We believe that
state high-risk pools

21:17.600 --> 21:20.900
are a smarter way
of guaranteeing coverage

21:20.900 --> 21:22.600
for people with
pre-existing conditions.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.233
- Yes, high-risk pools.

21:24.233 --> 21:26.333
Now, they may sound like
something you find

21:26.333 --> 21:27.700
at Jeremy Piven's house,

21:27.700 --> 21:29.834
but what they actually do

21:29.834 --> 21:32.934
is isolate the sickest people
in their own insurance group.

21:32.934 --> 21:35.433
Now, in theory,
this brings everyone else's

21:35.433 --> 21:36.734
insurance rates down,

21:36.734 --> 21:38.734
but there is an obvious
problem here again.

21:38.734 --> 21:41.467
Those pools are going to be
incredibly expensive,

21:41.467 --> 21:44.767
which is fine, if the government
subsidizes them properly.

21:44.767 --> 21:46.633
But if it doesn't,
that's right,

21:46.633 --> 21:49.000
it's thong o'clock, everybody.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.700
Because three years ago,
a study estimated that

21:51.700 --> 21:53.433
adequately funding
high-risk pools,

21:53.433 --> 21:56.166
just to maintain Obamacare
levels of coverage,

21:56.166 --> 21:59.200
would cost around $178 billion
a year.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.667
Guess how much Tom Price
set aside?

22:01.667 --> 22:04.800
$3 billion over three years.

22:04.800 --> 22:09.133
That is 1/178th
of what is needed.

22:09.133 --> 22:14.000
Imagine you asked for 178 pounds
of grade-A premium hunk.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.533
But instead of Chris Evans,

22:15.533 --> 22:18.533
someone brought you six
of his severed toes.

22:18.533 --> 22:23.433
Well, Tom Price's plan
is six severed hunk toes.

22:23.433 --> 22:26.400
So--so those are
the four big bullet points.

22:26.400 --> 22:29.066
But perhaps the most revealing
thing about this document

22:29.066 --> 22:31.767
is not what's inside it,
but what is not in there,

22:31.767 --> 22:35.367
because there is no replacement
for the individual mandate,

22:35.367 --> 22:39.333
Obamacare's requirement that you
have insurance or pay a penalty.

22:39.333 --> 22:42.133
And it is the thing
that people hate the most.

22:42.133 --> 22:45.066
- The individual mandate
is unconstitutional.

22:45.066 --> 22:46.934
- We got to get rid of
the individual mandate.

22:46.934 --> 22:48.767
I believe that is
a freedom-killing part

22:48.767 --> 22:49.934
of the Affordable Care Act.

22:49.934 --> 22:51.800
- Out the gate,
that should be repealed.

22:51.800 --> 22:53.467
Get rid of the individual
mandate.

22:53.467 --> 22:56.467
- Who's got two thumbs and
hates the individual mandate?

22:56.467 --> 22:58.900
This fucking guy.

22:58.900 --> 23:01.300
But--but the mandate
keeps younger,

23:01.300 --> 23:02.667
healthier people in the system,

23:02.667 --> 23:05.500
which is crucial to lower
the cost for everyone else

23:05.500 --> 23:08.033
and to keep in
popular provisions like,

23:08.033 --> 23:11.834
among other things,
not punishing fat babies.

23:11.834 --> 23:15.633
The--the Republicans' solution
is to make it really painful

23:15.633 --> 23:17.200
for you to get insurance again

23:17.200 --> 23:20.367
if you drop it at any point
for any reason.

23:20.367 --> 23:22.300
They use
the positive-sounding term

23:22.300 --> 23:24.233
"continuous coverage incentive,"

23:24.233 --> 23:26.700
but it has to involve
some kind of penalty--

23:26.700 --> 23:30.100
maybe a higher premium
or even denial of coverage.

23:30.100 --> 23:33.367
And they are not keen to talk
about details there.

23:33.367 --> 23:35.400
Remember the "placeholder"
from earlier?

23:35.400 --> 23:37.800
That was in place
of an explanation

23:37.800 --> 23:40.100
of the continuous
coverage incentive.

23:40.100 --> 23:42.734
Basically,
this is a subject so toxic,

23:42.734 --> 23:45.066
they'd rather just go
abruptly silent,

23:45.066 --> 23:47.567
much like when you're
a white person singing karaoke

23:47.567 --> 23:51.400
and you realize, "Uh-oh,
We have an N-word coming up."

23:51.400 --> 23:53.066
[laughter]

23:53.066 --> 23:58.000
So, Republicans are
in a real bind here.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.500
They need a plan and soon,

24:00.500 --> 24:03.033
and what Price and Ryan
have given them so far

24:03.033 --> 24:05.400
seems to shift costs from
the government to the people

24:05.400 --> 24:07.266
and from the healthy
to the sick,

24:07.266 --> 24:09.400
and fewer people are
going to be covered.

24:09.400 --> 24:11.967
So good luck fixing that,
Republicans.

24:11.967 --> 24:13.967
Oh, and there's actually
one more problem here,

24:13.967 --> 24:17.333
because you remember how much
shit you gave President Obama

24:17.333 --> 24:19.233
for saying you can
keep your doctor?

24:19.233 --> 24:22.033
Ah, let me remind you what
Donald Trump has promised

24:22.033 --> 24:24.100
that you are going to do.

24:24.100 --> 24:25.133
- Everybody's got to be covered.

24:25.133 --> 24:27.100
This is an un-Republican
thing for me to say,

24:27.100 --> 24:28.767
because a lot of times
they say, "No, no,

24:28.767 --> 24:31.433
the lower 25%, they can't
afford private, but--"

24:31.433 --> 24:32.600
- Universal health care?

24:32.600 --> 24:34.367
- I am going to take care
of everybody.

24:34.367 --> 24:36.066
I'm--I don't care if it
costs me votes or not.

24:36.066 --> 24:37.066
Everybody's gonna be
taken care of,

24:37.066 --> 24:38.600
much better than they're
taken care of now.

24:38.600 --> 24:39.500
- Who pays for it?

24:39.500 --> 24:40.734
- The government's
gonna pay for it.

24:40.734 --> 24:43.166
But we're going to save so much
money on the other side.

24:43.166 --> 24:45.600
But for the most part, it's
going to be a private plan,

24:45.600 --> 24:47.934
and people are gonna be able
to go out and negotiate

24:47.934 --> 24:50.433
great plans with lots
of different competition,

24:50.433 --> 24:53.300
with lots of competitors,
with great companies--

24:53.300 --> 24:54.600
and they can have their doctors.

24:54.600 --> 24:56.533
They can have their plans.
They can have everything.

24:56.533 --> 24:59.800
- "They can have everything!"
Period!

24:59.800 --> 25:02.533
So anything short of that
is a disaster.

25:02.533 --> 25:05.200
And insurers are gonna need
an answer soon, Republicans,

25:05.200 --> 25:07.200
so tick-tock, motherfuckers,

25:07.200 --> 25:10.000
'cause you don't get
to placeholder your way

25:10.000 --> 25:12.500
out of this one again.

25:12.500 --> 25:14.800
And now this.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.867
[trumpets swelling]

25:20.967 --> 25:22.667
- How weird--my nephew Will Carr

25:22.667 --> 25:24.700
hangs around with
John Grisham's kid.

25:24.700 --> 25:26.033
Now, fun little fact:

25:26.033 --> 25:30.533
my beloved late father's
first cousin, growing up,

25:30.533 --> 25:32.533
they were buddies--
they're cousins--

25:32.533 --> 25:34.900
he was a close friend
of Ronald Reagan's.

25:34.900 --> 25:37.834
Fun fact: Bridget Moynahan
watches channel two.

25:37.834 --> 25:39.433
She's probably watching
right now.

25:39.433 --> 25:42.834
Sweet as they come, uh, and
we appreciate her tuning in.

25:42.834 --> 25:44.533
I love "Madam Secretary."
It's a great show.

25:44.533 --> 25:46.767
I met Tim Daly at
an auto show once.

25:46.767 --> 25:48.500
Lionel Richie is
just a nice guy.

25:48.500 --> 25:50.633
He's been in here.
He's a nice guy.

25:50.633 --> 25:52.567
I just like the Peyton Manning
commercials.

25:52.567 --> 25:54.533
He just seems like
such a nice guy.

25:54.533 --> 25:58.667
I actually met Norman Lear in
the cafeteria downstairs here.

25:58.667 --> 26:00.233
Nicest guy ever.

26:00.233 --> 26:01.767
And here at the CBS
broadcast center,

26:01.767 --> 26:04.233
we have pictures around
the building

26:04.233 --> 26:05.967
of some of the great
Norman Lear hits.

26:05.967 --> 26:07.500
It was a very nice moment.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.033
Nice guy.
He had a salad.

26:09.033 --> 26:11.166
[laughter]

26:11.166 --> 26:15.300
- And finally tonight, a few
words about the Supreme Court,

26:15.300 --> 26:18.867
America's most respected adult
assisted living community.

26:18.867 --> 26:20.734
Now, as--as you probably know,

26:20.734 --> 26:22.333
there is currently a vacancy,

26:22.333 --> 26:24.734
following the death
last February of Antonin Scalia.

26:24.734 --> 26:25.667
And just a few weeks ago,

26:25.667 --> 26:28.467
President Trump announced
his nominee.

26:28.467 --> 26:29.734
- In a primetime reveal,

26:29.734 --> 26:32.700
President Trump unveiling judge
Neil Gorsuch

26:32.700 --> 26:35.066
as his nominee
to the Supreme Court.

26:35.066 --> 26:38.400
- Yes, Neil Gorsuch,
a man so blandly handsome,

26:38.400 --> 26:40.633
it feels like you saw him
on page 14

26:40.633 --> 26:43.066
of any JCPenney's catalog

26:43.066 --> 26:46.133
or as second lead in
an erectile dysfunction ad.

26:46.133 --> 26:49.233
He is--he is
aggressively Caucasian.

26:49.233 --> 26:51.166
He's like a white Tim Kaine.

26:51.166 --> 26:55.700
But--but there is--
there is a lot for Democrats

26:55.700 --> 26:57.066
to be annoyed about here.

26:57.066 --> 26:59.533
Not only is Gorsuch
extremely conservative,

26:59.533 --> 27:02.033
Republicans basically
stole this seat,

27:02.033 --> 27:03.233
because Merrick Garland,

27:03.233 --> 27:05.266
who Obama nominated
11 months ago,

27:05.266 --> 27:07.100
wasn't even given a hearing.

27:07.100 --> 27:10.200
So the debate now is whether
to filibuster Gorsuch

27:10.200 --> 27:12.867
or confirm a man whose place
on the Supreme Court

27:12.867 --> 27:14.600
will always have
an asterisk on it,

27:14.600 --> 27:17.867
which actually puts our show
in a tricky position as well.

27:17.867 --> 27:20.934
As you may know, we have
an all-dog Supreme Court

27:20.934 --> 27:23.200
to reenact oral arguments,

27:23.200 --> 27:25.233
since cameras are not allowed
in the courtroom.

27:25.233 --> 27:27.633
When Merrick Garland
was nominated, we held a vote

27:27.633 --> 27:31.033
to choose his dog and you,
the people, chose Molly.

27:31.033 --> 27:34.233
Sadly, Molly never got to serve.

27:34.233 --> 27:36.734
She's on a farm upstate with
a lot of grass and toys

27:36.734 --> 27:40.467
to play with, not unlike
the actual Merrick Garland.

27:40.467 --> 27:44.767
So, technically, we should be
finding a dog for Gorsuch now.

27:44.767 --> 27:45.934
But we're not going to do that.

27:45.934 --> 27:48.867
Instead, to reflect the fact
that Gorsuch's nomination

27:48.867 --> 27:51.166
is a historical aberration,

27:51.166 --> 27:54.133
he will be getting an animal
that will constantly remind us

27:54.133 --> 27:57.333
that it has no place
in that spot on a dog court.

27:57.333 --> 27:58.633
What I'm saying is,

27:58.633 --> 28:00.400
Gorsuch is getting a lobster.

28:00.400 --> 28:03.600
That's right, we're going
"paws and claws"

28:03.600 --> 28:05.266
up in this piece.

28:05.266 --> 28:07.433
But we still need your help

28:07.433 --> 28:08.934
to pick a lobster Gorsuch.

28:08.934 --> 28:12.033
So tonight, we're asking you
to advise and consent

28:12.033 --> 28:16.533
on the choice between these
three glorious lobster justices,

28:16.533 --> 28:19.800
all of whom,
like Neil Gorsuch himself,

28:19.800 --> 28:24.333
have absolutely no business
being here.

28:24.333 --> 28:27.000
First up,
there is Cindy Clawford,

28:27.000 --> 28:28.900
a strict constructionist

28:28.900 --> 28:31.533
who believes that life begins
at the piercing of the abdomen

28:31.533 --> 28:33.667
with the first pair of pleopods.

28:33.667 --> 28:36.900
In the middle, there's
Pinchers Von Shellington III,

28:36.900 --> 28:39.133
a staunch opponent
of judicial activism

28:39.133 --> 28:42.600
who pairs beautifully with
a light tarragon cream sauce.

28:42.600 --> 28:44.633
And finally, there's Mike.

28:44.633 --> 28:47.967
His teeth are actually a gastric
mill located in his stomach,

28:47.967 --> 28:50.967
and he's just a fucking lobster.

28:50.967 --> 28:52.600
So choose wisely, America,

28:52.600 --> 28:55.033
because this is
a lifetime appointment,

28:55.033 --> 28:58.867
and lobsters can apparently live
to be up to 100 years old.

28:58.867 --> 29:00.433
Who knew?

29:00.433 --> 29:02.166
So visit our Twitter feed

29:02.166 --> 29:05.133
and choose Cindy Clawford,
Pinchers, or Mike.

29:05.133 --> 29:06.433
Or tweet your thoughts

29:06.433 --> 29:08.667
using the hashtag
#ClawAndOrder.

29:08.667 --> 29:11.300
Thank you so much
for joining us.

29:11.300 --> 29:12.800
We will see you next week.

29:12.800 --> 29:14.033
Goodnight.

29:14.033 --> 29:17.066
