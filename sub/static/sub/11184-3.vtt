WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:03.838
The wolf has come down from the north.

00:05.739 --> 00:07.650
(Narrator) Next, on Airwolf.

00:10.777 --> 00:13.280
We're closing on an aircraft, String.

00:14.114 --> 00:15.821
Weapons went to combat mode.

00:15.883 --> 00:18.124
Dom, get control of that autopilot.

00:18.619 --> 00:19.791
Too late.

00:20.821 --> 00:23.097
Airwolf's in a steep dive, flat out.

00:23.423 --> 00:26.302
I created Airwolf, and I will destroy it.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074

02:18.839 --> 02:20.819
Are you okay, Dr. Burton?

02:21.008 --> 02:22.248
Okay!?

02:22.442 --> 02:24.979
This is the ride of a lifetime.

02:28.949 --> 02:31.054
(Dominic) You ain't seen nothin’ yet, Doc.

02:31.485 --> 02:35.900
My buddy’ll snake this baby through
those passes like Jean-Claude Killy.

02:41.962 --> 02:44.203
[radar beeping]

02:47.434 --> 02:49.209
(Stringfellow) How's our radar profile, Dom?

02:49.269 --> 02:50.942
(Dominic) Back to 98.7.

02:51.271 --> 02:54.184
As far as radar's concerned, we're invisible.

02:55.542 --> 02:57.988
(Burton) Isn't it sad we have
to sneak past our own defenses

02:58.045 --> 03:00.150
in order to make progress toward peace?

03:00.914 --> 03:04.521
From what you told me, the Russian
scientists are even more covert.

03:04.818 --> 03:06.456
They're very brave people.

03:06.586 --> 03:08.532
Every year, they risk a life in prison

03:08.588 --> 03:11.091
by breaking away from the official
expedition for a few days

03:11.158 --> 03:12.262
to meet with me.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.104
Our little informal meetings have helped

03:15.162 --> 03:17.108
cool down the arms race a lot, I think.

03:17.664 --> 03:18.904
Amen to that.

03:19.266 --> 03:21.212
Of course, if I'm still on that island

03:21.268 --> 03:22.770
when that Russian mother ship returns,

03:22.836 --> 03:24.577
I may be joining them in that prison.

03:24.638 --> 03:27.676
Don't worry, we'll pick
you up. You got my word.

03:28.075 --> 03:30.248
(Dominic) Bering Sea dead ahead, String.

03:31.912 --> 03:34.518
So long, Alaska. Hello, Russia.

04:11.284 --> 04:12.319
Bye-bye, Doc.

04:12.385 --> 04:14.558
Okay, okay. Have a good trip.

04:14.621 --> 04:16.156
See you later, Dr. Burton.

04:40.213 --> 04:42.523
Course is 180, due south.

04:42.849 --> 04:46.160
[laughing] Boy, give me a palm tree any day.

04:46.219 --> 04:47.789
I'm with you, Dom.

04:52.793 --> 04:53.965
(Marella) No sign of ‘em.

04:54.427 --> 04:57.431
(Michael) Halfway home and NORAD
never knew they were there.

04:59.399 --> 05:00.605
[rapid beeping]

05:00.667 --> 05:01.941
What the…

05:04.404 --> 05:07.044
Sir, you better take a look at this.

05:09.676 --> 05:12.987
All of a sudden, there are a lot of
targets where there shouldn't be.

05:15.348 --> 05:16.349
What?

05:16.883 --> 05:19.454
What was it, a malfunction in the system?

05:20.554 --> 05:22.363
I sure hope so.

05:24.224 --> 05:25.897
(Dominic) I don't care what anybody says.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.870
I feel good about this mission.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.430
Hear, hear.

05:29.896 --> 05:33.309
Dr. Roger Burton is a unique individual.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.674
If his work with the international
scientific community

05:36.736 --> 05:38.682
didn't have to be conducted in secret,

05:39.239 --> 05:42.743
he'd have won a whole fistful
of Nobel Peace Prizes by now.

05:42.909 --> 05:44.115
Yeah.

05:44.177 --> 05:47.090
I'd sure hate to see a man like
that fall into the wrong hands.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.490
It'd be a tragedy.

05:48.882 --> 05:51.226
And a propaganda nightmare.

05:51.284 --> 05:54.754
That's why you've got to duplicate
your performance on Friday, Hawke.

05:55.922 --> 05:57.868
You don't have to convince me of that.

05:59.092 --> 06:02.301
Any… any problems with Airwolf?

06:02.762 --> 06:05.368
You know, that's the third
time you've asked me that.

06:05.632 --> 06:07.441
It's just a simple question.

06:07.834 --> 06:10.474
Michael doesn't ask simple questions.

06:12.772 --> 06:15.981
Marella was monitoring the
NORAD map when you came south.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.050
How cozy. She had her eye on us.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.887
Well, I couldn't exactly
see you, but…

06:23.383 --> 06:25.693
well, there were several stray targets.

06:25.785 --> 06:27.594
No one could explain them.

06:27.654 --> 06:29.463
They appeared, disappeared…

06:29.522 --> 06:30.762
"Several"?

06:31.224 --> 06:32.498
From you?

06:33.293 --> 06:34.863
Exactly 6.

06:35.195 --> 06:38.699
Well, again, nice work.

06:39.599 --> 06:41.374
We'll be watching for you on Friday.

06:41.434 --> 06:43.778
And hoping we don't see you.

06:51.678 --> 06:53.055
[door closing]

06:54.347 --> 06:56.349
You know, I didn't wanna say anything before,

06:56.416 --> 06:59.090
but those Airwolf computers
were a little screwy.

07:00.987 --> 07:01.988
Yeah.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.259
Look, let's sleep on it.

07:04.491 --> 07:07.495
We'll play test pilot between
now and Friday, check it out.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.671
Good idea. Hey, you got another beer?

08:29.809 --> 08:31.220
(Stringfellow) How's it looking, Dom?

08:31.277 --> 08:33.188
(Dominic) Good as gold back here.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.398
You ready to try autopilot?

08:53.133 --> 08:55.079
Come on, come on, baby.

08:55.835 --> 08:58.611
The nav system's refusing to engage, String.

09:03.343 --> 09:05.584
We're engaged now. Here comes autopilot.

09:05.979 --> 09:06.980
Hey!

09:07.047 --> 09:08.287
What happened?

09:08.348 --> 09:10.658
The autopilot changed course on us.

09:10.717 --> 09:11.821
It can't do that.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.491
It can't, but it did. The course is due north.

09:15.522 --> 09:18.230
Do you suppose it wants to
go back to the ice and snow?

09:18.291 --> 09:20.202
Well, do you think getting
close to the North Pole

09:20.260 --> 09:21.864
has something to do with it?

09:22.228 --> 09:23.366
Maybe.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.143
Well, let's just let her fly for a while.

09:26.433 --> 09:27.935
See what's happening.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.412
Okay,

09:29.469 --> 09:33.417
but I'd feel better with a thumb
and 4 fingers on the stick.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.685
We're gonna have to change
course and soon, String.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.659
The Air Force test range is dead ahead.

09:43.716 --> 09:46.754
Disengage, we'll come left and go around.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.265
Disengaged.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.961
No, it's not. I haven't got control.

09:51.157 --> 09:52.693
It won't disengage.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.238
We're closing on an aircraft, String.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.313
Weapons went to combat mode.

10:08.374 --> 10:10.217
Dom, get control of that autopilot.

10:11.077 --> 10:12.249
Too late.

10:14.581 --> 10:16.356
Oh, my God!

10:19.219 --> 10:21.028
We killed that crew, String.

10:21.087 --> 10:23.795
No, it was a drone. A target plane.

10:29.062 --> 10:31.042
I've got control. It released.

10:31.097 --> 10:33.236
Yeah, but let's get this baby back to the lair

10:33.299 --> 10:35.370
before something else happens, huh?

10:35.435 --> 10:37.073
My thoughts exactly.

10:53.319 --> 10:57.631
I'm sorry, String. I'm over my head with this.

10:58.925 --> 11:00.802
No, you're okay, you're just…

11:02.729 --> 11:03.833
Old-timer?

11:03.897 --> 11:05.638
Come on, why don't you finish the sentence?

11:05.698 --> 11:07.678
Hey, you work the keyboard just fine.

11:07.767 --> 11:10.213
Especially for a guy who
crank-started his first car.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.340
I'll crank-start you.

11:13.239 --> 11:15.378
You know, I can't even type a letter.

11:27.453 --> 11:30.161
So, how are we gonna pick
up Dr. Burton on Friday?

11:30.924 --> 11:32.835
The computer controls and monitors

11:32.892 --> 11:34.872
every system aboard Airwolf. You know that.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.236
We're gonna fix it.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.242
Oh? And what if we can't?

11:38.698 --> 11:40.939
Forget "can't." There's
no such word as "can't."

11:41.000 --> 11:43.537
Okay, but we'll need help.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.749
I don't even wanna hear his name.

11:47.907 --> 11:51.218
As much as I hate to, we've got
to go with Archangel on this.

11:51.277 --> 11:52.620
No way.

11:53.179 --> 11:56.752
Look, why don't we get a bunch
of his whiz-kid computer types

11:56.816 --> 11:58.818
and bring them down here blindfolded

11:58.885 --> 12:00.364
and put them to work and… and…

12:00.420 --> 12:02.127
Yeah, and then we got
the Firm's people in here.

12:02.188 --> 12:03.462
How do we get them out?

12:03.523 --> 12:06.265
Look, if we can't program Airwolf's computers,

12:06.960 --> 12:10.237
how are we gonna know what
they're gonna put in there?

12:11.064 --> 12:14.307
My friend, there comes a
time in everyone's life

12:14.367 --> 12:16.847
when you've gotta put your trust in somebody.

12:16.903 --> 12:19.611
We can't fix her. Archangel can.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.746
We have no choice.

12:26.679 --> 12:27.987
Maybe we do.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.931
(Karen) Good.

12:46.666 --> 12:48.873
Don't overcompensate, now.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.351
Good.

13:03.283 --> 13:07.356
All right, now concentrate.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.123
[Stringfellow clears his throat]
A hard right turn.

13:11.758 --> 13:13.328
You're not concentrating.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.430
Sorry, Dr. Hansen. We have visitors.

13:15.862 --> 13:17.000
Visitors?

13:17.430 --> 13:19.842
Dr. Hansen, you might remember me.

13:19.999 --> 13:21.569
My name is Stringfellow Hawke.

13:22.368 --> 13:24.075
Stringfellow Hawke.

13:24.570 --> 13:27.141
I wonder if we might have a few words.

13:28.741 --> 13:30.482
Take a break, Stan.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.464
You seem to have changed quite a bit

13:40.520 --> 13:41.965
since the last time I saw you.

13:42.021 --> 13:43.967
Well yes, I lost a few pounds.

13:44.190 --> 13:46.136
Changed my programming, so to speak.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.529
You seem about the same, though.

13:48.594 --> 13:49.834
Maybe a little older.

13:49.896 --> 13:50.897
[snickers]

13:52.899 --> 13:56.437
This is my friend Dominic Santini.

13:56.502 --> 13:57.810
Pleased to meet you.

13:57.870 --> 13:58.974
Hello.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.510
So, what did you wanna talk about, Hawke?

14:02.241 --> 14:03.242
Airwolf.

14:03.810 --> 14:06.689
Oh, that was such a tragedy,
the way it was lost.

14:06.979 --> 14:09.084
It was so far ahead of its time.

14:09.315 --> 14:12.421
I always suspected
Charles Moffett was unstable.

14:13.953 --> 14:16.331
You haven't heard the rumors, then?

14:16.556 --> 14:18.797
I mean, among the intelligence community?

14:18.858 --> 14:22.032
I'm not in the intelligence
community. How could I hear them?

14:22.395 --> 14:25.342
Well, the rumor is that Airwolf has survived

14:25.398 --> 14:28.208
and that Archangel is using
it for special missions.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.512
Why are you telling me this?

14:30.570 --> 14:34.040
Because Airwolf's computer system

14:34.574 --> 14:36.554
has serious problems,

14:36.642 --> 14:39.521
and I understand that you
worked on the original program.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.751
So, you're still with the Firm?

14:42.048 --> 14:44.289
Not exactly.

14:45.918 --> 14:47.625
I don't understand.

14:48.621 --> 14:51.227
I'd be more than happy
to explain it all to you

14:51.290 --> 14:53.600
if you'd promise to help us.

14:53.659 --> 14:55.138
Well, I…

14:55.762 --> 14:57.264
I don't know.

14:57.797 --> 14:59.777
Give me some time to think about it.

15:00.133 --> 15:03.546
Would it be all right if we
come back after a while?

15:03.970 --> 15:05.313
Okay.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.445
Thank you.

15:13.713 --> 15:16.284
Just a dull, dedicated, scientific type, huh?

15:16.382 --> 15:18.589
Well, the lady's changed, just a tad.

15:18.651 --> 15:19.994
[scoffs]

15:36.903 --> 15:42.046
This is Charles Henry Moffett.
I am the creator of Airwolf.

15:42.809 --> 15:46.120
And this is my last will and testament.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.271
(Stringfellow) It's a special
meeting of scientists

16:00.326 --> 16:02.363
that have taken place for several years.

16:02.428 --> 16:05.170
They help defuse world tension
by sharing information.

16:05.231 --> 16:07.370
(Karen) The Russians would
do a double back-flip

16:07.433 --> 16:09.106
if they knew this was going on.

16:09.168 --> 16:11.114
So would our own government.

16:11.204 --> 16:14.549
That's why we've gotta get him
out of there in 2 days.

16:16.042 --> 16:17.385
Well, here we are.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.762
It's beautiful.

16:32.358 --> 16:33.530
Sorry about the blindfold.

16:33.593 --> 16:36.540
No, it's better I don't know where we are.

16:36.762 --> 16:39.709
Yeah, we didn't want you to end up
playing 20 questions with the Firm.

16:39.765 --> 16:40.800
[computer beeping]

16:40.867 --> 16:42.676
Did you guys leave the computer on?

16:42.768 --> 16:44.338
[computer buzzing]

16:49.642 --> 16:52.555
This is my last will and testament.

16:53.412 --> 16:56.621
Airwolf has been instructed
to engage this special program

16:56.682 --> 16:59.993
if it failed to receive a
code from me at this time.

17:00.820 --> 17:05.234
I must assume that I am imprisoned or dead.

17:07.026 --> 17:12.635
So, what will I leave this tacky,
money-grubbing world to remember me by?

17:13.665 --> 17:16.203
I leave a machine out of control,

17:17.103 --> 17:21.848
a machine worthy of that
insane world of theirs.

17:22.974 --> 17:25.285
The wolf has come down from the north,

17:26.178 --> 17:31.287
and your fat little town is safe no longer.

17:33.419 --> 17:35.922
This is Charles Henry Moffett.

17:36.689 --> 17:39.568
This is my last will and testament.

17:40.293 --> 17:42.204
Airwolf has been instructed to engage…

17:42.261 --> 17:43.797
Hey, can we shut him off?

17:43.863 --> 17:46.400
…if it failed to receive a
code from me at this time.

17:46.465 --> 17:49.571
Moffett foresaw that he might
lose control of Airwolf.

17:49.702 --> 17:51.943
He protected himself like this.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.112
He really was a genius, you know.

17:56.976 --> 17:58.785
Twisted genius.

17:59.011 --> 18:00.786
Gives me the creeps.

18:01.614 --> 18:05.061
It's like a ghost. Whoever
heard of a haunted helicopter?

18:05.184 --> 18:07.357
We see a lot of this in the computer trade.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.331
It's called a logic bomb.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.537
Mamma mia! Not only a ghost, but bombs, too?

18:13.793 --> 18:15.670
I'll give you the classic example.

18:16.295 --> 18:19.936
A guy is fired from a company
with a computerized payroll.

18:20.099 --> 18:24.138
But before he leaves, he plants a logic
bomb in the central programming.

18:24.270 --> 18:28.548
Now, when the computer senses that his
name is no longer on the payroll,

18:29.742 --> 18:32.313
it's instructed to disrupt the company,

18:32.545 --> 18:36.083
say, by adding a zero to
everybody else's check.

18:36.415 --> 18:40.056
Someone making $750 is suddenly making $7,500.

18:40.252 --> 18:42.960
It can be darn hard to dig out,
too, if it's planted deep enough.

18:43.022 --> 18:44.194
Can you do it?

18:44.256 --> 18:47.430
Well, I used to play a lot
of chess with Moffett.

18:47.526 --> 18:48.800
I usually won.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.499
This is no chess game.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.042
In a way, it is.

18:52.098 --> 18:53.771
You see, for every move I make,

18:53.833 --> 18:56.074
he may have already programmed a counter-move.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.342
Say, if I turn him off today,

18:58.771 --> 19:02.810
it triggers a signal to come back on
tomorrow, when I don't expect it.

19:04.910 --> 19:06.321
Complicated.

19:06.379 --> 19:09.189
Stick with me, kid. Like I said,
we played a lot of chess.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.893
Hey, maybe we'd better get something to eat.

19:12.952 --> 19:14.260
Good idea.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.765
Do we get a campfire?

19:17.089 --> 19:19.000
What kind of high tech-er are you?

19:19.558 --> 19:21.037
We got a gas stove.

19:21.093 --> 19:23.733
Oh, come on. Let's have a little romance.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.908
Airwolf has been instructed to
engage this special program

19:27.967 --> 19:29.002
Yeah.

19:29.068 --> 19:32.015
…if it failed to receive a
code from me at this time.

19:32.972 --> 19:36.943
I must assume that I am imprisoned or dead.

19:39.011 --> 19:44.586
So, what will I leave this tacky,
money-grubbing world to remember me by?

19:45.351 --> 19:47.092
Oh, shut up.

19:47.153 --> 19:48.154
[beeps]

19:53.325 --> 19:57.535
That was the craziest thing I have
ever done, landing on that sub.

19:57.596 --> 19:58.836
A submarine?

19:58.898 --> 19:59.899
A big one.

19:59.965 --> 20:03.538
In the middle of the Pacific, their
computer had a nervous breakdown.

20:03.903 --> 20:06.679
I was a freelance troubleshooter
with a Secret clearance.

20:06.739 --> 20:11.779
So, 10 hours later, there I was,
doing my Harry Houdini imitation

20:11.844 --> 20:15.257
from a chopper slung 100
feet above a rolling deck.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.092
You get it fixed?

20:18.150 --> 20:19.254
Oh, sure.

20:19.418 --> 20:24.959
But for the next 15 days, I was the
lone female in a crew of 120-plus men

20:25.024 --> 20:27.800
who had all been on patrol for 60 days.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.235
Uh-oh.

20:29.628 --> 20:31.505
(Karen) I learned one thing.

20:31.797 --> 20:32.867
What's that?

20:32.932 --> 20:34.138
Karate.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.644
Seriously, though, they were all gentlemen.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.787
Is that the salt, Dom?

20:47.012 --> 20:48.753
Oh, yeah sure.

20:50.049 --> 20:52.393
Say, if you don't mind,
I've been meaning to ask you

20:52.451 --> 20:55.921
about that experiment that you
were running in your lab.

20:56.322 --> 20:57.323
Oh.

20:57.690 --> 21:01.297
I'm working on a program
that would enable a man to fly

21:01.360 --> 21:03.601
by merely thinking the maneuvers.

21:03.662 --> 21:06.074
A right bank, a dive, whatever.

21:06.532 --> 21:09.775
And land in a crosswind and pluck
a kitten out of a tree, huh?

21:09.835 --> 21:10.905
You can scoff.

21:10.970 --> 21:13.814
But in 20 years, the way
you fly will be obsolete.

21:13.873 --> 21:15.250
Excuse me,

21:15.307 --> 21:18.686
but I've been hearing that word,
"obsolete," most all of my life.

21:18.744 --> 21:20.155
And you know what?

21:20.212 --> 21:22.192
We still dig holes with shovels.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.160
So, if you had it your way,

21:26.218 --> 21:28.698
there'd be hundreds of combat
pilots with nothing to do?

21:28.754 --> 21:31.234
Oh, I'm sure you'll think of something to do.

21:31.724 --> 21:34.603
Like they used to say, "Make love, not war."

21:36.729 --> 21:39.869
They'll probably come up with a
computer to improve on that.

21:41.767 --> 21:43.110
Maybe.

21:44.670 --> 21:48.641
But like Dom says, "We still
dig holes with shovels."

21:57.883 --> 22:00.329
(Karen) Okay Moffett, round 2.

22:09.061 --> 22:12.338
Airwolf has been instructed
to engage this special program

22:12.398 --> 22:15.709
if it failed to receive a
code from me at this time.

22:16.202 --> 22:20.742
I must assume that I am imprisoned or dead.

22:28.714 --> 22:31.991
(Gilson) I have a bone to
pick with you, Archangel.

22:32.451 --> 22:36.297
General Gilson, what a pleasant surprise.

22:36.822 --> 22:39.393
What takes you so far from the beaten path?

22:39.458 --> 22:43.270
I am hot and I am tired and I
want some straight answers.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.369
As soon as I hear a straight question.

22:50.436 --> 22:51.881
Well, how's this?

22:52.771 --> 22:57.277
Are you testing some kind of stealth
aircraft in NORAD's northern sector?

22:58.177 --> 22:59.713
"Stealth aircraft"?

23:00.579 --> 23:03.059
You know what it means, invisible to radar.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.658
Answer the question.

23:09.688 --> 23:11.531
We are testing nothing.

23:11.824 --> 23:14.930
Then why did my big board
light up with false targets

23:15.027 --> 23:18.600
the same day you people started
monitoring our operations?

23:19.932 --> 23:21.434
I don't know.

23:21.500 --> 23:25.778
The Pentagon agreed to provide
your Firm with that information

23:25.838 --> 23:27.476
over my personal objections.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.554
Now, I'm warning you.

23:30.743 --> 23:33.587
If you're doing what I think you're doing,

23:33.746 --> 23:37.125
I'll have whatever it is shot out of the sky.

23:38.951 --> 23:41.295
I hope we understand each other.

23:59.305 --> 24:01.512
Now, why are you looking at me like that?

24:01.774 --> 24:03.549
You know what I have to do about Airwolf.

24:03.609 --> 24:05.555
I have no choice.

24:14.954 --> 24:19.460
I must assume that I am imprisoned or dead.

24:21.794 --> 24:27.676
So, what will I leave this tacky,
money-grubbing planet to remember me by?

24:28.634 --> 24:29.840
I leave a machine…

24:29.902 --> 24:31.040
[Karen screams]

24:31.136 --> 24:32.547
[sparks crackling]

24:33.339 --> 24:34.716
What the…

24:38.877 --> 24:40.379
- What happened?
- Are you okay?

24:40.446 --> 24:42.221
Electric charge.

24:42.581 --> 24:45.425
Electric charge? It tried to electrocute you?

24:45.484 --> 24:47.225
Yeah, isn't that great?

24:48.754 --> 24:50.631
Well, that's a significant clue.

24:50.689 --> 24:53.226
I think Moffett's ghost is done for.

24:54.760 --> 24:57.240
I think you've been working too many hours.

24:57.296 --> 24:58.798
How about some fresh air?

24:58.864 --> 25:00.866
That sounds like a good idea.

25:12.578 --> 25:16.924
Well, nothing like a change
of scenery, is there?

25:19.485 --> 25:22.466
Yeah, I guess we don't need this anymore.

25:24.923 --> 25:25.924
Oh.

25:26.625 --> 25:28.161
It's pretty here.

25:29.194 --> 25:30.264
Yeah.

25:30.829 --> 25:32.035
Hawke?

25:32.097 --> 25:33.098
Uh-huh?

25:33.165 --> 25:35.167
Let me ask you something.

25:36.168 --> 25:38.705
How do you remember me from those days?

25:39.538 --> 25:43.213
Dedicated, worked long hours,
committed to the project.

25:43.942 --> 25:45.888
It was my whole life back then, work.

25:46.311 --> 25:48.723
The project, the team, the job.

25:49.014 --> 25:50.857
At home, I felt dead.

25:52.985 --> 25:56.694
Yeah, I can hardly believe how
much you've changed since then.

25:57.322 --> 25:59.529
That time I spent on the submarine

25:59.591 --> 26:01.537
That was back when I looked so terrible.

26:01.593 --> 26:02.936
And the whole time I was aboard,

26:02.995 --> 26:05.066
they all treated me like one of the guys.

26:05.130 --> 26:06.632
I hated that.

26:06.932 --> 26:09.879
Well, they sure wouldn't treat
you like one of the guys now.

26:10.969 --> 26:12.141
Let's go on back.

26:12.204 --> 26:13.205
Okay.

26:17.142 --> 26:18.587
(Karen) Valley of the Gods.

26:19.812 --> 26:20.882
What?

26:20.946 --> 26:22.323
Nothing.

26:39.531 --> 26:40.805
Do it.

26:43.669 --> 26:44.670
No.

26:50.476 --> 26:51.477
No!

26:54.279 --> 26:55.690
Accept that.

26:58.650 --> 26:59.788
Good.

27:00.552 --> 27:02.327
Now pay attention.

27:04.823 --> 27:07.633
This is my last will and testament.

27:07.693 --> 27:10.833
Airwolf has been instructed
to engage this special program

27:10.896 --> 27:14.241
if it failed to receive a
code from me at this time.

27:14.600 --> 27:18.377
Now goodbye, Charles Henry Moffett.

27:18.437 --> 27:19.438
…or dead.

27:21.507 --> 27:22.986
[roaring]

27:24.510 --> 27:25.511
{whooping]

27:25.811 --> 27:27.313
All right!

27:40.025 --> 27:42.767
She's starting to feel like her
old self. Kick ‘em on, Dom.

27:42.828 --> 27:45.741
Kick on the turbos, let's give
this lady a ride for her money.

27:45.797 --> 27:46.901
Okay.

27:47.866 --> 27:50.073
Oh, wait a minute, String.

27:50.869 --> 27:52.871
You got traffic dead ahead.

27:53.705 --> 27:55.048
Slow, single engine.

28:02.414 --> 28:05.020
Hey, Dom, what's going on?
Did you switch on autopilot?

28:05.083 --> 28:07.563
I hate to say it, but we
still got ghosts back here.

28:07.619 --> 28:09.997
Impossible, I erased that entire menu.

28:10.055 --> 28:11.762
Well, the computer doesn't know that.

28:16.962 --> 28:18.270
(Dominic) Oh, no!

28:18.330 --> 28:22.335
The computer now is showing that
private plane as a target, a MIG-23.

28:22.401 --> 28:23.709
Dom, cut it off.

28:23.769 --> 28:24.873
I can't.

28:24.937 --> 28:27.474
Try “cancel, double M”.

28:30.642 --> 28:32.315
…and testament.

29:03.342 --> 29:05.083
(Stringfellow) It tried to kill those people.

29:05.143 --> 29:06.213
(Karen) It missed?

29:06.278 --> 29:11.660
No, we replaced the live ammo
with blanks, just in case.

29:12.384 --> 29:13.954
Now it's turning north.

29:14.920 --> 29:15.990
Always north.

29:16.288 --> 29:18.097
Hey, can you get us back in control?

29:18.924 --> 29:20.904
Auto-engage override is isolated?

29:20.959 --> 29:24.372
I cut it out completely,
including the diffuser channel.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.602
Type this, direct to CP.

29:26.665 --> 29:31.410
U-U-U-1-5, disengage.

29:34.506 --> 29:36.042
Nothing.

29:44.583 --> 29:46.153
Now it's chasin’ birds.

29:46.251 --> 29:50.791
Try U-U-U-COMDEC-1-5.

29:53.392 --> 29:54.598
Try it.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.471
(Stringfellow) I've got it.

29:57.763 --> 30:00.209
Get us down fast. That won't last forever.

30:05.671 --> 30:08.083
I don't know what to say.

30:09.574 --> 30:10.644
I'm sorry.

30:10.976 --> 30:12.853
Well, at least no one was hurt.

30:13.478 --> 30:15.685
It had me completely faked out.

30:16.281 --> 30:18.727
It must be tied to every system aboard,

30:18.817 --> 30:20.956
like some disease spreading.

30:21.386 --> 30:24.697
Are you saying that Airwolf
will never fly again?

30:24.756 --> 30:26.997
Well, I'm gonna take it up again.

30:27.059 --> 30:28.936
I gotta get Dr. Burton.

30:29.094 --> 30:32.303
Look, if I had a more powerful computer,

30:32.364 --> 30:36.278
I might be able to override this
one and cancel out the program.

30:37.369 --> 30:39.906
If I can get one on such short notice.

30:45.444 --> 30:48.152
I leave a machine out of control,

30:48.847 --> 30:53.421
a machine worthy of that
insane world of theirs.

30:54.886 --> 30:57.162
The wolf has come down from the north,

30:57.956 --> 31:03.167
and your fat little town is safe no longer.

31:05.163 --> 31:07.473
This is Charles Henry Moffett.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.711
Moffett. Now Moffett's ghost?

31:12.604 --> 31:15.380
Aren't we ever gonna be free of this maniac?

31:15.607 --> 31:17.382
We wondered the same thing.

31:17.442 --> 31:19.479
And what does that psychotic riddle mean,

31:19.544 --> 31:21.581
"The wolf has come down from the north"?

31:21.646 --> 31:23.648
It's a colloquialism from a novel by…

31:23.715 --> 31:25.023
Thank you.

31:26.318 --> 31:28.958
Our expert says there's more levels.

31:29.020 --> 31:30.465
We don't even know what he wants yet.

31:30.522 --> 31:33.025
Well, whatever he wants, we know it isn't good,

31:33.091 --> 31:37.096
and until we can sort out those
computers, Airwolf should be grounded.

31:39.331 --> 31:42.642
Perhaps we should have some of
our experts take a look at it.

31:42.701 --> 31:46.080
Fat chance. You don't mean take
a look. You mean take back.

31:46.171 --> 31:48.879
And we already had an expert look at it.

31:49.107 --> 31:52.520
Well, not a very good one,
judging by your last flight.

31:52.677 --> 31:55.681
What happens if the next target
it mistakes for a MIG-25

31:55.747 --> 31:57.988
is in fact a 747?

31:59.284 --> 32:02.197
Every piece of armament has been taken off her.

32:02.254 --> 32:04.894
Suppose Moffett had a kamikaze streak?

32:05.724 --> 32:08.102
People's lives are at stake here.

32:08.326 --> 32:09.600
Your lives!

32:09.661 --> 32:11.538
What about Dr. Burton's life?

32:11.630 --> 32:16.045
We will attempt to provide the Doctor
with another means of transportation out.

32:16.668 --> 32:19.615
I promised the man that I would pick him up.

32:19.671 --> 32:21.048
In Airwolf.

32:21.106 --> 32:23.484
You are impossible to talk to.

32:25.343 --> 32:26.549
Dom.

32:30.982 --> 32:34.828
The computer equipment your
expert asked for is on the ramp.

32:49.067 --> 32:51.843
These are some classified,
detailed designs of Airwolf.

32:51.903 --> 32:54.474
I thought you might like to
show them to your computer man.

32:54.539 --> 32:55.882
Thank you.

32:58.143 --> 33:00.316
She must love one of us, String.

33:00.378 --> 33:02.051
The one is Airwolf.

33:03.682 --> 33:05.127
Take care.

33:21.132 --> 33:26.343
This is Charles Henry Moffett.
I am the creator of Airwolf.

33:26.705 --> 33:30.084
And this is my last will and testament.

33:48.126 --> 33:50.128
After talking with Hawke and Santini,

33:50.195 --> 33:52.266
I'm convinced there's no turning them away.

33:52.330 --> 33:54.105
They will fly Airwolf.

33:54.165 --> 33:56.406
I can't imagine anything more terrifying

33:56.468 --> 33:58.607
than that machine under Moffett's control.

33:58.870 --> 34:01.680
God knows what he's programmed it to do.

34:02.240 --> 34:06.552
If you can fix Airwolf with
absolute certainty, do it.

34:07.178 --> 34:09.886
But if there's even the slightest question,

34:10.415 --> 34:13.554
in a compartment in the rear of
this unit is a homing beacon

34:13.618 --> 34:16.155
and a small explosive charge with a detonator.

34:16.221 --> 34:20.226
You will activate the beacon,
and our personnel will move in.

34:20.559 --> 34:21.902
If they attempt to lift off,

34:21.960 --> 34:25.772
explosives placed on the rudder
will safely disable Airwolf.

34:26.630 --> 34:27.938
Dr. Hansen,

34:28.934 --> 34:33.781
we are all counting on you
in this unpleasant business.

35:05.503 --> 35:07.141
Say, "Good morning."

35:08.206 --> 35:09.742
Good morning.

35:12.410 --> 35:13.855
Did you fix her?

35:14.379 --> 35:15.858
I don't know.

35:20.051 --> 35:21.325
Well, you tried.

35:21.386 --> 35:22.490
Wait.

35:23.755 --> 35:26.736
We can't wait any longer, honey.
We got a passenger waiting.

35:27.092 --> 35:29.868
I just told you, I don't know if it's fixed.

35:30.562 --> 35:32.735
We'll disconnect the
electronics and fly it cold.

35:32.797 --> 35:33.832
It's been done before.

35:33.898 --> 35:35.639
Moffett's programming could override that.

35:35.700 --> 35:39.409
You touch anything in there, including
the radio, and you're inviting disaster.

35:39.838 --> 35:41.112
It'll be okay.

35:41.172 --> 35:42.276
No!

35:43.508 --> 35:46.887
I've planted an explosive,
and this is the detonator.

35:47.379 --> 35:49.916
Now get away, I'm warning you.

35:50.248 --> 35:51.352
Why?

35:51.950 --> 35:53.588
I have my orders.

35:53.652 --> 35:55.131
What do you mean, "orders"?

35:55.186 --> 35:56.392
I'm sorry, Hawke.

35:56.454 --> 35:59.333
I know how important Airwolf is to you.

35:59.391 --> 36:01.496
Your brother and everything.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.569
She's with the Firm.

36:05.330 --> 36:08.800
I suppose Mr. Clean is on
his way up here now, huh?

36:09.234 --> 36:11.111
I've activated a homing beacon.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.341
Where is it?

36:12.404 --> 36:14.577
Stay back, I will detonate this.

36:14.639 --> 36:18.815
And that means Moffett
wins and Dr. Burton dies.

36:19.711 --> 36:21.190
I can't help that.

36:21.246 --> 36:24.420
Oh, yes, you can. You can
put that down right now.

36:24.482 --> 36:26.120
It's too risky.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.562
You know, you've talked about a lot of things,

36:28.620 --> 36:31.100
like how to take control of
your life. Well, then, do it.

36:31.156 --> 36:34.103
Either push that detonator or let's go.

36:34.159 --> 36:36.571
If Moffett's still in that
machine, we need you.

36:39.597 --> 36:41.406
The decision's yours.

36:49.507 --> 36:52.511
(Marella) Jericho 1, this is
Angel 1. We're within 2 miles.

36:52.577 --> 36:54.853
Homing signal still strong and closing.

36:54.913 --> 36:56.722
(man) Angel 1, this is Groundskeeper.

36:56.781 --> 36:58.692
Angel 1, this is Groundskeeper.

36:58.750 --> 37:01.196
We're locked onto Dr. Hansen's homing device.

37:01.753 --> 37:04.461
Good. Don't lose it, whatever you do.

37:04.622 --> 37:06.226
Roger, Marella.

37:19.504 --> 37:21.506
Howdy. Fill her up?

37:22.907 --> 37:26.150
Or did you come here to see the 2-headed snake?

37:50.635 --> 37:53.343
Well, it looks like we're
just about at the Bering Sea.

37:53.404 --> 37:54.849
How do you feel?

37:54.906 --> 37:56.180
Alive.

37:57.642 --> 37:59.849
Scared, but alive.

38:31.843 --> 38:33.379
[helicopters approaching]

39:27.098 --> 39:28.543
Where's Mr. Santini?

39:28.600 --> 39:30.273
We've had a crew change.

39:30.335 --> 39:33.578
Dr. Karen Hansen, this is Dr. Roger Burton.

39:33.638 --> 39:34.912
Welcome aboard, Doctor.

39:34.973 --> 39:36.748
Did you get a look at those gunships?

39:36.808 --> 39:38.719
Those helicopters were headed west.

39:38.776 --> 39:43.054
(Stringfellow) Then we'll head north, over
the Pole, and come down the East Coast.

39:43.114 --> 39:46.095
(Karen) Why not back the way
we came, toward Alaska?

39:46.150 --> 39:49.359
We've gotta return Dr. Burton
to Washington immediately.

39:54.759 --> 39:56.261
We're approaching the coastal ATIS.

39:56.327 --> 39:57.601
We'll have to use the computers.

39:57.662 --> 40:01.405
(Karen) Hawke, we can't take the
chance that Moffett is really gone.

40:01.466 --> 40:04.174
And I can't risk flying
into US territory blind.

40:04.235 --> 40:05.543
Let's try it.

40:05.603 --> 40:08.140
All right, keep your fingers crossed.

40:09.707 --> 40:12.017
(Karen) We're coming online now.

40:19.550 --> 40:22.156
(Air Traffic Controller) I have a
bogey penetrating US airspace.

40:22.220 --> 40:23.665
Scramble jets and intercept.

40:26.824 --> 40:28.269
(Pilot) Baker flight, airborne.

40:34.232 --> 40:37.338
Hawke, I have 2 jets vectoring on us.

40:39.804 --> 40:42.478
Unidentified helicopter, I am on your tail.

40:42.540 --> 40:45.214
Identify yourself at once. Over.

40:47.045 --> 40:48.956
Unidentified black helicopter,

40:49.013 --> 40:51.755
identify yourself at once. Over.

40:51.816 --> 40:53.227
What will you do?

40:53.284 --> 40:55.230
We can outrun them with the turbos.

40:55.286 --> 40:56.390
Yeah, for a while.

40:56.454 --> 40:59.264
They'll report us to the Air
Command, and it's a long way home.

40:59.324 --> 41:00.667
We'll have to talk to them.

41:02.026 --> 41:03.198
(Stringfellow) Air Force pursuit,

41:03.261 --> 41:07.607
we are on an unscheduled intelligence
mission for the United States.

41:07.665 --> 41:09.042
We are unarmed.

41:10.635 --> 41:13.445
(Pilot) Follow me to a
landing zone and set down.

41:15.206 --> 41:16.844
Air Force, my course is…

41:16.908 --> 41:17.909
[static buzzing]

41:19.944 --> 41:22.720
(Pilot) Acknowledge my
transmissions or I will fire.

41:22.780 --> 41:25.192
I say again, I will fire. Over.

41:25.249 --> 41:27.126
Air Force pursuit, do you read me?

41:27.185 --> 41:28.186
[static buzzing]

41:30.955 --> 41:32.730
(Pilot) They're not acknowledging.

41:32.790 --> 41:34.394
Moving into attack position.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.108
Holy! Look at that.

41:45.236 --> 41:47.079
Max thrust. Let's go.

42:03.254 --> 42:04.733
Hawke, what are you doing?

42:04.789 --> 42:06.735
I'm not doing anything.

42:19.437 --> 42:21.314
(Pilot) Topped out. I'm at ceiling.

42:21.372 --> 42:23.147
We're gonna need help with this guy.

42:23.207 --> 42:25.312
Watchdog, Watchdog, this is flight Baker.

42:25.376 --> 42:28.289
Watchdog, this is flight Baker. Do you read?

42:36.687 --> 42:38.428
Quite an elevator ride.

42:38.489 --> 42:39.763
Is everybody okay?

42:39.824 --> 42:41.360
Yes, I'm okay. Did it…?

42:41.426 --> 42:42.962
Yeah, it put us right into a power climb.

42:43.027 --> 42:44.028
What is "it"?

42:44.095 --> 42:46.371
(Karen) Our onboard computer.
It's out of my control.

42:46.431 --> 42:47.967
(Stringfellow) Well, then, take it back.

42:48.032 --> 42:49.807
I can't. Oh, my God.

42:49.867 --> 42:52.313
Moffett's taking control of the ship's systems.

42:52.370 --> 42:53.440
(Stringfellow) Where are the jets?

42:53.504 --> 42:54.505
(Karen) Directly below us.

42:54.572 --> 42:55.607
Can they hear us?

42:55.673 --> 42:59.450
No. They're trying to radio for
assistance, but Moffett's jamming.

43:01.279 --> 43:03.190
This is Charles Henry Moffett,

43:03.247 --> 43:05.989
and this is my last message to all of you.

43:06.050 --> 43:09.224
I created Airwolf, and I will destroy her.

43:09.754 --> 43:13.429
Airwolf goes back to the womb with a boom.

43:13.491 --> 43:16.734
Check and mate. That's all, folks.

43:20.998 --> 43:22.636
Oh, my God.

43:22.700 --> 43:24.145
What is that?

43:24.469 --> 43:25.914
He's projecting.

43:25.970 --> 43:27.278
Russian bombers!

43:30.374 --> 43:32.877
(Karen) He's making us a target for NORAD.

43:32.944 --> 43:34.184
(Stringfellow) More than that.

43:34.245 --> 43:37.158
Those bogeys are to create
confusion so we can get through.

43:37.215 --> 43:40.662
Didn't you hear him? He's targeted
us to kill Langley. The Firm!

43:40.718 --> 43:42.891
There are thousands at that one facility alone,

43:42.954 --> 43:44.661
and when Langley starts to defend itself,

43:44.722 --> 43:46.531
a lot of people will die.

43:46.824 --> 43:48.269
[siren wailing]

44:06.777 --> 44:09.724
(Stringfellow) Jericho Approach.
Jericho Approach, come in.

44:09.780 --> 44:11.316
Archangel, talk to me.

44:11.382 --> 44:14.056
I'm broadcasting in the clear. Come in.

44:14.118 --> 44:17.327
It's no use. Moffett's jamming us.

44:17.388 --> 44:19.994
He'll know. He'll have to know.

44:20.358 --> 44:22.235
Archangel, talk to me.

44:22.527 --> 44:25.633
You know what we're up against. It's Moffett.

44:26.030 --> 44:28.271
Get me General Gilson, please.

44:28.599 --> 44:31.876
It's not what we think that
matters, it's what NORAD thinks.

44:31.936 --> 44:33.540
What are you gonna tell him?

44:33.604 --> 44:35.880
To disregard the radarscope.

44:36.340 --> 44:38.650
He may not disregard.

44:39.844 --> 44:42.848
General, this is Archangel.

44:43.347 --> 44:45.725
The radar tracks you're getting are false.

44:45.783 --> 44:47.763
I repeat, false.

44:47.818 --> 44:49.593
You were right about my project.

44:49.654 --> 44:52.692
I was testing an aircraft.
Something went wrong.

44:52.757 --> 44:54.930
It is sending out those tracks.

44:54.992 --> 44:57.165
There are no Russian missiles.

44:57.228 --> 44:59.139
One plane is doing all that?

44:59.197 --> 45:01.438
It's an extraordinary aircraft.

45:01.499 --> 45:04.207
General, you've got to believe me.
What you're getting is…

45:04.268 --> 45:05.679
I warned you.

45:07.838 --> 45:11.012
I think we've got one chance,
people, the purge control.

45:11.075 --> 45:13.055
Maybe we can freeze Moffett out.

45:13.110 --> 45:15.181
Yes, yes, do it!

45:15.246 --> 45:16.953
Make no mistake,

45:17.014 --> 45:19.858
what depressurizing the cockpit
at this altitude will mean.

46:48.673 --> 46:52.086
(Stringfellow) I remember an offer
to overhaul a certain helicopter,

46:52.143 --> 46:53.816
no questions asked.

46:53.878 --> 46:55.585
You name the time and place.

46:55.646 --> 46:58.650
(Karen) Just send us the parts.
We'll take care of it.

46:58.983 --> 47:01.827
The question is, will it
ever be free of Moffett?

47:01.886 --> 47:05.891
(Karen) It is already, The extreme
cold purged all programming.

47:05.956 --> 47:09.335
It's a blank slate now, like a
child waiting to be taught.

47:09.393 --> 47:11.395
Yeah, and I know a real good teacher.

47:11.462 --> 47:12.941
Well, just promise me one thing.

47:12.997 --> 47:16.376
Will you leave out the story
of the big, bad wolf, okay?

47:16.767 --> 47:17.871
[chuckles] Yeah.

47:17.935 --> 47:19.005
You got it.
