00:06.593 --> 00:08.329
Mr. Cole...

00:11.444 --> 00:13.347
Do you believe in fate?

00:18.614 --> 00:21.488
<i>Three years ago, I sent a traveler</i>

00:21.543 --> 00:23.152
<i>back in time...</i>

00:23.251 --> 00:26.145
- Hey, hey!
<i>- To stop a plague...</i>

00:26.285 --> 00:28.886
<i>that had killed 7 billion people...</i>

00:32.244 --> 00:35.547
<i>Change history, and save the future.</i>

00:35.624 --> 00:37.727
What's happening?

00:37.790 --> 00:40.657
<i>However, the puzzle was far more complex</i>

00:40.719 --> 00:42.592
<i>than we could have ever imagined.</i>

00:42.673 --> 00:44.576
What the hell?

00:44.709 --> 00:48.251
<i>We discovered
the Army of the 12 Monkeys,</i>

00:48.451 --> 00:51.354
<i>a conspiracy spanning centuries,</i>

00:51.553 --> 00:55.662
<i>a cult operating
by fierce religious devotion</i>

00:55.771 --> 00:57.498
<i>to the word of its prophet,</i>

00:57.559 --> 01:02.863
<i>a woman from the future who
called herself the Witness.</i>

01:03.366 --> 01:06.267
<i>The world's end,
an infinite hell on earth,</i>

01:06.330 --> 01:08.626
<i>are by her design.</i>

01:08.696 --> 01:09.806
Begin.

01:11.221 --> 01:13.090
There's too many!

01:13.238 --> 01:17.777
<i>And our mission to stop her
has come at a tremendous cost.</i>

01:24.151 --> 01:28.856
<i>And now, the last remaining
survivors of Project Splinter</i>

01:29.056 --> 01:30.758
<i>have lost everything.</i>

01:30.857 --> 01:33.860
I am dying.

01:34.060 --> 01:36.396
<i>Our will...</i>

01:36.597 --> 01:38.532
<i>our hope...</i>

01:40.166 --> 01:42.536
<i>Our friends.</i>

01:44.137 --> 01:47.904
<i>The Witness has already
begun her destruction of time,</i>

01:48.387 --> 01:50.157
<i>her Red Forest.</i>

01:52.079 --> 01:56.883
<i>And the puzzle, the one
we set out to solve together,</i>

01:56.965 --> 01:59.552
<i>has finally given us an answer.</i>

02:02.856 --> 02:04.691
<i>But not the one we hoped.</i>

02:04.791 --> 02:06.277
What the hell is this?

02:06.363 --> 02:10.631
<i>For, you see, the only
way to save the world...</i>

02:10.731 --> 02:13.562
This is a program for a machine.

02:13.641 --> 02:15.702
<i>To save the past...</i>

02:15.902 --> 02:17.503
<i>the present,</i>

02:17.703 --> 02:19.872
<i>the future</i>

02:20.073 --> 02:22.576
<i>is to erase James Cole...</i>

02:22.675 --> 02:25.779
This is every time he has traveled.

02:25.978 --> 02:29.982
<i>Delete him from every moment.</i>

02:33.572 --> 02:36.589
<i>The loops in time out of time...</i>

02:36.722 --> 02:38.408
<i>This war...</i>

02:39.726 --> 02:41.995
<i>It's all a disease</i>

02:42.194 --> 02:43.797
<i>created by the cure.</i>

02:45.565 --> 02:48.702
<i>Primaries didn't send us
here to stop the plague.</i>

02:48.765 --> 02:50.768
<i>They sent us here to release it.</i>

02:51.071 --> 02:53.806
<i>The end was the beginning,</i>

02:53.944 --> 02:56.947
<i>the serpent eating its tail.</i>

02:57.091 --> 03:00.931
<i>And now, that beginning</i>

03:01.114 --> 03:04.016
<i>is finally here.</i>

03:13.827 --> 03:17.030
<i>My name is Dr. Cassandra Railly
of the M....</i>

03:17.062 --> 03:19.632
<i>We're working on
containment of the Cole...</i>

03:19.700 --> 03:22.293
<i>DDC stations, hear me.</i>

03:22.347 --> 03:25.816
<i>The plague starts with Leland Frost.</i>

03:27.698 --> 03:29.900
<i>The true architects of the plague,</i>

03:29.932 --> 03:31.968
<i>they're watching me.</i>

03:32.002 --> 03:34.171
<i>I'm running out of time.</i>

03:34.204 --> 03:36.510
<i>Is among you.</i>

03:36.840 --> 03:39.042
<i>Please, Cole.</i>

04:36.233 --> 04:38.198
Careful.

04:39.069 --> 04:41.072
She's a delicate beast.

04:44.942 --> 04:46.711
Oh, uh...

04:46.743 --> 04:48.978
I'm not here to harm you.

04:49.012 --> 04:51.982
It's just my own protection, really.

04:52.014 --> 04:54.718
You're wondering how even one scavenger

04:54.752 --> 04:56.754
might be able to remain here,

04:56.786 --> 04:58.822
after Mr. Whitley cleared them all out.

04:58.855 --> 05:00.824
The thought crossed my mind.

05:00.858 --> 05:03.507
Well, it's a sizeable
facility, isn't it?

05:03.793 --> 05:05.349
I imagine it'll take you some time

05:05.374 --> 05:07.270
to discover all the hiding places.

05:10.533 --> 05:12.836
- Smoke?
- I quit.

05:12.870 --> 05:16.206
Oh, yes, for someone you lost.

05:20.978 --> 05:23.848
Foster sent you. That son of a...

05:23.880 --> 05:25.148
Mm-mm-mm.

05:28.384 --> 05:31.768
"Project Splinter."

05:31.921 --> 05:34.524
Project Splinter. Wow.

05:40.361 --> 05:43.932
You're going to need
a lot of test subjects.

05:43.966 --> 05:46.602
Are you prepared for that?

05:46.634 --> 05:49.839
Sending men to their deaths?

05:49.872 --> 05:51.907
Yes.

05:57.379 --> 05:59.315
Awfully selfish of you, isn't it?

05:59.348 --> 06:01.317
Just to save one daughter?

06:01.349 --> 06:04.352
In saving my daughter,
I'll save the world.

06:04.385 --> 06:06.221
But this world is.

06:08.356 --> 06:11.025
And who are you to say
it should be any different?

06:11.058 --> 06:14.229
Because <i> I</i> have the power to change it.

06:14.262 --> 06:15.930
Ah, yes.

06:18.332 --> 06:21.460
Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown.

06:22.004 --> 06:23.973
I just want a chance.

06:24.005 --> 06:26.107
However remote. To do nothing...

06:26.133 --> 06:29.076
Mm, to do nothing...

06:30.178 --> 06:33.014
would be like killing her yourself.

06:38.252 --> 06:40.264
I understand...

06:40.738 --> 06:42.774
better than most.

06:43.361 --> 06:45.431
Still, there may come a day

06:45.487 --> 06:46.995
when a single life for 7 billion

06:47.029 --> 06:49.120
is one too many.

06:49.932 --> 06:51.500
Consider this then.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.627
No matter what,

06:54.069 --> 06:56.005
save the one.

06:58.206 --> 06:59.867
I wish you luck.

07:00.709 --> 07:02.687
You know...

07:03.211 --> 07:06.382
I have every confidence you'll succeed.

07:41.016 --> 07:42.351
In the beginning,

07:42.416 --> 07:45.429
when we first came to Project Splinter,

07:45.553 --> 07:49.656
I had to recreate these injections,

07:49.781 --> 07:54.069
both for my memory and using
my own DNA as a template.

07:54.228 --> 07:58.249
16 people were killed in that machine.

07:58.399 --> 08:01.866
Their bodies rejected the serum.

08:02.103 --> 08:05.084
The machine tore them apart.

08:05.240 --> 08:09.289
We never had a successful
splinter until James Cole.

08:10.077 --> 08:13.315
You made time travel work.

08:14.449 --> 08:16.820
But I never knew why,

08:17.284 --> 08:19.575
until now.

08:24.925 --> 08:27.233
I'm the demon.

08:31.051 --> 08:33.188
First time traveler.

08:35.169 --> 08:37.606
I'm the one who drove time insane.

08:39.408 --> 08:41.110
No, Cole...

08:41.143 --> 08:43.446
That's what the Primaries'
weapon was for...

08:44.612 --> 08:46.341
To erase me,

08:46.481 --> 08:48.516
completely, forever.

08:51.620 --> 08:54.456
I'm so sorry, Cole.

08:54.791 --> 08:56.673
I didn't know.

08:57.292 --> 08:59.295
It's all right.

09:18.447 --> 09:20.316
Okay.

09:21.515 --> 09:23.217
So, how do we do it? We take their code,

09:23.250 --> 09:25.086
- we put it in our machine...
- No.

09:26.587 --> 09:28.591
No.

09:30.225 --> 09:32.094
No, this can't be it.

09:32.126 --> 09:34.229
There has to be another way. Jones?

09:36.597 --> 09:39.067
This is not how it was supposed to end.

09:39.101 --> 09:41.636
How was it supposed to end?

09:41.669 --> 09:44.139
The mission hasn't changed...

09:45.474 --> 09:47.443
Only our feelings.

09:47.476 --> 09:50.611
But if you can erase him,
you can erase Olivia.

09:50.644 --> 09:53.415
There has to be another way.

09:55.216 --> 09:57.218
Maybe...

09:57.251 --> 09:59.454
but this is what we have.

09:59.487 --> 10:01.871
We have run simulation after simul...

10:01.918 --> 10:05.020
But I just murdered 7 billion people.

10:05.559 --> 10:08.304
I will not murder 7 billion and 1,

10:08.335 --> 10:11.343
not when the one is worth all the rest.

10:11.533 --> 10:13.534
Time will be reset.

10:13.567 --> 10:16.538
- They will live again.
- But he won't.

10:16.571 --> 10:19.341
He can't.

10:19.374 --> 10:20.609
- He can't exist at all.
- It's okay.

10:20.641 --> 10:21.889
- No, it's not okay...
- Cassie...

10:21.914 --> 10:23.958
No, it's not okay.

10:24.312 --> 10:27.115
You've given everything to time.

10:28.649 --> 10:30.801
You are owed.

10:31.653 --> 10:35.168
I am owed.

10:35.657 --> 10:38.460
Time owes all of us.

11:18.966 --> 11:21.308
Our time is now.

11:22.470 --> 11:25.386
Yesterday is now.

11:25.974 --> 11:29.207
Tomorrow is now.

11:29.577 --> 11:31.612
Everything always

11:31.645 --> 11:35.559
will soon enough be now.

11:40.822 --> 11:43.958
<i>The beginning of the end
is over for them...</i>

11:46.595 --> 11:50.332
While we stand here
at the end of time...

11:52.634 --> 11:54.702
<i>The dawn of the endless.</i>

11:58.740 --> 12:01.070
By the time this day is over

12:01.275 --> 12:03.594
and the sun has set...

12:04.645 --> 12:08.055
<i>time itself will be ours,</i>

12:08.383 --> 12:10.880
and the sun will rise

12:11.162 --> 12:14.911
<i>when we sit in our forest of red.</i>

12:15.289 --> 12:18.919
Now! Now!

12:18.986 --> 12:20.822
Now!

12:20.919 --> 12:24.298
Now! Now! Now!

12:24.369 --> 12:25.797
Now!

12:53.850 --> 12:54.985
James...

12:57.836 --> 13:00.506
This must be.

13:02.007 --> 13:04.485
We need to complete your cycle,

13:04.575 --> 13:07.845
so that you end up here with the answer.

14:49.275 --> 14:52.142
What the hell are you?

15:06.810 --> 15:08.779
Cole!

15:20.523 --> 15:22.830
The Emerson.

15:23.471 --> 15:25.406
Whoa, oh, oh, easy.

15:25.494 --> 15:27.297
Who are you?

15:31.501 --> 15:33.337
That's right.

15:33.369 --> 15:35.972
Take it all in.

15:36.006 --> 15:38.541
Greetings, asshole.

15:38.574 --> 15:41.109
I'm future asshole.

15:44.414 --> 15:46.742
<i>This is a long fight.</i>

15:46.916 --> 15:49.375
You're only halfway there.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.814
It's gonna hurt.

15:52.823 --> 15:55.759
Things inside of you are gonna break,

15:56.459 --> 15:58.863
things you never even knew you had.

16:01.376 --> 16:04.613
I'll tell you something
I probably shouldn't.

16:04.834 --> 16:07.388
Probably screwing with
all that causality bullshit

16:07.419 --> 16:09.371
Jones used to go on about.

16:16.946 --> 16:20.088
You're gonna have to forgive yourself...

16:20.449 --> 16:22.353
for what you've done,

16:22.518 --> 16:24.587
for what you're gonna have to do.

16:27.858 --> 16:29.788
There's a beginning...

16:30.060 --> 16:32.896
and there's an end to all this...

16:34.830 --> 16:37.341
And all you and I are ever gonna have

16:37.392 --> 16:39.466
is what's in-between.

16:42.939 --> 16:45.223
Wearing this...

16:45.549 --> 16:49.314
means that somehow, somewhere,

16:49.646 --> 16:52.483
you're always gonna
find your way back to her.

16:58.622 --> 17:00.958
Time to go.

17:05.162 --> 17:06.997
See you soon.

17:23.878 --> 17:26.582
That was harder than
I thought it was gonna be.

17:26.616 --> 17:28.853
You told him there was hope.

17:30.454 --> 17:32.489
I had to get here somehow.

17:39.229 --> 17:42.098
You know there's another way.

17:42.131 --> 17:43.933
No.

17:43.966 --> 17:45.997
There's not.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.977
Ms. Goines, you are on foreign soil

17:58.028 --> 17:59.649
in a time of plague,

17:59.683 --> 18:03.554
hunted, cornered, alone.

18:03.587 --> 18:05.489
I'm not alone.

18:05.521 --> 18:07.023
Wait!

18:10.493 --> 18:12.995
Oh, my God, I can't believe that worked!

18:13.029 --> 18:15.636
Ah, James!

18:16.165 --> 18:17.634
Wait...

18:20.136 --> 18:22.505
Which Cole are you?

18:24.040 --> 18:26.710
Last one I'm ever gonna be.

18:50.953 --> 18:51.988
Jesus.

18:53.221 --> 18:54.891
Oh.

18:54.923 --> 18:56.792
I had your back in Prague.

18:56.825 --> 18:59.695
Thanks for making it easy on me.

18:59.728 --> 19:01.898
Thank you.

19:01.930 --> 19:03.900
What's wrong?

19:03.932 --> 19:05.935
There's a problem.

19:05.968 --> 19:07.603
The Primary code has given us

19:07.636 --> 19:09.104
the method to reset the timeline.

19:12.208 --> 19:15.510
Yeah... we're running out of time,

19:15.535 --> 19:17.288
so let's get me in that thing, erase me,

19:17.343 --> 19:18.686
whatever you gotta do.

19:18.749 --> 19:20.585
We can't.

19:20.617 --> 19:22.909
It would take 3 1/2 years
for our systems

19:22.940 --> 19:25.689
to compile and assemble the entire code.

19:27.124 --> 19:29.737
Time will collapse in a matter of hours,

19:29.894 --> 19:33.698
12, maybe 13 at best.

19:33.731 --> 19:35.767
So we go back,

19:35.799 --> 19:37.635
give ourselves the code in the past.

19:37.667 --> 19:41.028
Rendering our machine useless
for all those years.

19:41.053 --> 19:43.608
We'd halt the mission
before it even began.

19:43.641 --> 19:47.045
We'd never reach this point
with the answer.

19:47.505 --> 19:50.409
What about Titan?
It's a time-traveling city.

19:50.434 --> 19:52.917
It must have a thousand times
the processing power we do.

19:52.950 --> 19:54.619
Possibly,

19:54.652 --> 19:57.588
provided one could stop
Olivia's final sequence,

19:57.622 --> 20:00.422
and somehow impossibly, mind you,

20:00.476 --> 20:02.383
gain access to her systems.

20:02.429 --> 20:03.902
Even if we could,

20:03.927 --> 20:07.631
we have no idea
where or when Titan even is.

20:10.701 --> 20:12.797
I'm sorry.

20:13.671 --> 20:15.827
If I hadn't endeavored
to change history,

20:15.852 --> 20:17.040
to rewrite time,

20:17.074 --> 20:19.711
- to manipulate it for personal...
- James...

20:19.743 --> 20:22.060
I'll listen to the rest
of that speech in 12 hours.

20:22.085 --> 20:23.780
Till then, we got work to do.

20:32.088 --> 20:34.558
- James...
- I'm not giving up.

20:35.826 --> 20:37.630
Neither am I.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.764
There's another way.

20:41.598 --> 20:43.256
We can stop Olivia,

20:43.295 --> 20:45.636
kill the Witness, end the storms,

20:45.670 --> 20:47.906
but you don't have to
get into that machine.

20:47.975 --> 20:49.982
We can just live.

20:50.884 --> 20:53.220
If time can be rewritten,
the world can be remade.

20:53.254 --> 20:55.591
The virus mutates again.

20:55.623 --> 20:56.924
We know that.

20:56.957 --> 20:59.127
There's no one left in 2163.

20:59.159 --> 21:01.764
But maybe we can change all that.

21:03.031 --> 21:05.100
This is what was meant to be.

21:10.291 --> 21:13.775
We can do this, together.

21:13.807 --> 21:15.947
There's still time.

21:16.710 --> 21:19.814
- How?
- I have a plan.

21:19.848 --> 21:22.627
We can...

21:22.917 --> 21:25.187
What's that look for?

21:25.342 --> 21:27.344
I've just never heard
you say you have a plan.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.352
I've had plans before.

21:29.404 --> 21:30.876
- No, it's just...
- I have plans.

21:30.901 --> 21:32.709
It takes the end of the world
for you to have a plan.

21:32.734 --> 21:34.342
- You wanna hear it or not?
- Yes, I wouldn't miss it...

21:34.376 --> 21:36.345
Hm? Plan's this way.

21:36.378 --> 21:38.943
- Come on.
- Coming.

21:41.382 --> 21:43.284
There are a lot of variables.

21:43.318 --> 21:46.187
Yeah, and not enough manpower
to account for 'em all.

21:46.221 --> 21:48.791
- Man, it's crazy.
- Ha.

21:52.127 --> 21:54.230
For this to work,
we're gonna have to split up.

21:54.263 --> 21:56.165
- You'll be on your own.
- I can manage.

21:56.197 --> 21:58.767
I know the play.

21:58.801 --> 22:00.903
Ramse and I once took out

22:00.936 --> 22:04.340
a militia quarantine zone the same way:

22:04.372 --> 22:06.174
shock and awe.

22:06.207 --> 22:08.878
But like you said, you had
Ramse to watch your back.

22:08.910 --> 22:10.278
Yeah.

22:10.312 --> 22:12.389
We were good like that once...

22:12.900 --> 22:14.268
at our best.

22:23.958 --> 22:25.894
No.

22:29.031 --> 22:30.198
Ramse?

22:34.937 --> 22:36.938
I made a promise.

22:36.972 --> 22:38.206
Stop!

22:40.341 --> 22:42.244
Ramse and me,

22:42.276 --> 22:44.212
that story's been written.

22:49.318 --> 22:51.961
- Maybe there's a page missing.
- Cassie...

22:52.023 --> 22:54.967
If we do this, we need everyone:

22:55.230 --> 22:56.670
friends...

22:57.993 --> 22:59.360
and family.

23:05.399 --> 23:08.033
Do you understand
what you're asking me to do?

23:16.924 --> 23:18.314
Yes.

23:40.947 --> 23:43.150
- What'd you do?
- It's not what you think.

23:43.184 --> 23:44.952
What'd you do?

23:44.984 --> 23:47.921
Hey, Ramse...
it's all right, just relax.

23:47.946 --> 23:49.881
Ahh!

23:54.360 --> 23:56.030
Stop! Ramse!

24:03.337 --> 24:05.839
Come on.

24:05.872 --> 24:07.908
Come on, brother. It's all right.

24:10.243 --> 24:12.012
It's all right, man.

24:12.485 --> 24:14.891
You're okay.

24:15.115 --> 24:17.024
You're okay.

24:25.158 --> 24:27.195
It's me, brother.

24:37.937 --> 24:39.406
It's over.

24:41.341 --> 24:43.943
I'm sorry.

24:44.177 --> 24:46.763
Sorry, brother.

24:46.880 --> 24:48.482
I'm sorry.

25:07.467 --> 25:09.221
The Witness.

25:10.436 --> 25:12.776
Olivia?

25:13.072 --> 25:15.456
She killed your son...

25:15.943 --> 25:17.581
mine...

25:17.945 --> 25:20.481
and in a few hours,
everyone and everything.

25:25.319 --> 25:27.946
You said that I told you

25:28.213 --> 25:30.204
not to undo this.

25:30.491 --> 25:32.743
Yeah, and I won't.

25:33.426 --> 25:35.592
Once this is over, you have to go back,

25:35.662 --> 25:37.318
die that night,

25:37.497 --> 25:39.982
or else we never end up here.

25:40.199 --> 25:43.060
And I have to climb into that machine

25:43.236 --> 25:45.045
and be erased

25:45.230 --> 25:47.275
from everything.

25:49.475 --> 25:51.311
Jesus.

25:54.380 --> 25:57.013
But if we're going out...

25:57.518 --> 26:00.355
we're taking that bitch with us.

26:01.522 --> 26:03.390
I need you for that.

26:08.963 --> 26:10.409
Yeah.

26:11.231 --> 26:13.284
Yeah?

26:13.500 --> 26:15.303
Yeah.

26:29.282 --> 26:30.737
Hi.

26:32.418 --> 26:34.003
Hi.

26:48.002 --> 26:50.236
Holy shit balls!

26:55.442 --> 26:58.112
Mr. Cole, have you lost
your goddamn mind?

26:58.145 --> 27:00.281
Not him. Me.

27:00.313 --> 27:02.564
- It was my idea.
- 'Sup, bro?

27:02.603 --> 27:05.024
What's up, Cocoa Puffs?

27:05.049 --> 27:06.454
We're going on the offensive.

27:06.486 --> 27:09.622
I can assure you, this is offensive.

27:09.656 --> 27:11.132
The risk to causality?

27:11.218 --> 27:13.843
Won't mean anything
if we can't turn this around.

27:13.929 --> 27:15.930
She's his grammy.

27:15.964 --> 27:17.933
- Ms. Goines...
- Just filling him in.

27:17.966 --> 27:21.035
We have a plan, and we have a window.

27:21.069 --> 27:22.851
Odds are it's not gonna work,

27:22.914 --> 27:25.609
but it's the only chance we got.

27:25.940 --> 27:28.009
So what is it you wanna do, Mr. Cole?

27:30.378 --> 27:32.281
We're gonna take Titan.

28:03.911 --> 28:05.213
There it is.

28:05.246 --> 28:08.150
She is a beaut, isn't she?

28:10.272 --> 28:11.674
You think it'll still run?

28:11.700 --> 28:14.355
Ain't about the age, brother.

28:14.582 --> 28:17.891
It's about the gas
that's left in the tank.

28:18.215 --> 28:20.418
Everything else we can fix, you know?

28:25.441 --> 28:28.278
We gotta go. Almost out of time.

28:28.303 --> 28:31.340
You got your eyes on some keys there?

28:31.372 --> 28:34.761
Be a shame to hotwire a classic,

28:35.269 --> 28:38.279
especially knowing
how you feel about her.

28:42.984 --> 28:44.319
What'd you find?

28:47.769 --> 28:49.805
Somebody's reason to keep going.

28:53.929 --> 28:55.496
Ooh.

28:59.812 --> 29:02.748
- Are you ready?
- Just watch the paint.

29:29.725 --> 29:31.728
I got it.

29:31.897 --> 29:33.732
You couldn't find a closer car?

29:33.800 --> 29:35.354
It's not just any car.

29:38.822 --> 29:41.391
Then I guess we're ready.

29:45.212 --> 29:47.114
One more thing...

30:08.101 --> 30:10.470
It's beautiful.

30:10.504 --> 30:12.106
Yeah.

30:28.955 --> 30:31.523
I don't have, uh...

30:31.957 --> 30:34.227
forever to promise you.

30:37.930 --> 30:40.200
Most I can give you is this moment...

30:43.870 --> 30:46.506
But it's yours if you'll take it.

31:21.041 --> 31:22.876
This isn't enough.

31:35.322 --> 31:37.524
Look at the sun.

31:41.895 --> 31:44.064
You know why it's so beautiful?

31:46.632 --> 31:48.936
'Cause it sets.

33:21.226 --> 33:23.229
Honey, I'm home!

33:24.831 --> 33:28.968
Whoa... not-so-fun-house.

33:29.002 --> 33:31.104
Sorry to drop in on you unannounced.

33:35.140 --> 33:37.177
It was foolish of you to come.

33:42.448 --> 33:44.721
Why are you here?

33:45.815 --> 33:47.987
To say, adios, amigo.

33:49.389 --> 33:51.190
You may have destroyed
the Primary weapon,

33:51.224 --> 33:54.226
but what it was meant to do, the code,

33:54.260 --> 33:56.363
was in here the whole time.

33:57.831 --> 34:00.132
But before we fire up the machine

34:00.166 --> 34:02.002
and wipe you from time and existence,

34:02.034 --> 34:03.654
there's something
I thought you should know.

34:03.679 --> 34:05.718
You know your brand logo thing,

34:05.758 --> 34:07.774
"Copyright, The Witness, TM"?

34:07.806 --> 34:10.309
Well, I get it.

34:10.342 --> 34:13.266
It's Aramaic for the number 12

34:13.634 --> 34:17.547
mirrored to represent
the beginning, the end,

34:17.610 --> 34:20.056
blah-blah-blah, yadda-yadda-
yadda, such and such.

34:20.134 --> 34:22.803
But with just a few little tweaks...

34:26.476 --> 34:28.779
Looks like a little penis man.

34:30.380 --> 34:32.148
Is that because you're such a dick?

34:46.581 --> 34:48.440
Katarina.

34:49.366 --> 34:52.012
The Red Forest has begun.

34:52.168 --> 34:54.237
You're too late.

34:55.806 --> 34:57.775
Am I?

35:13.322 --> 35:17.161
<i>Auf Wiedersehen, Frau Kirschner.</i>

35:19.547 --> 35:22.650
2043 Manhattan.

35:22.721 --> 35:24.212
Now.

35:24.237 --> 35:25.802
But we're in the midst of the final s...

35:25.835 --> 35:27.437
They have the weapon.

35:35.277 --> 35:37.281
She's coming.

35:42.284 --> 35:44.282
It worked.

36:21.391 --> 36:23.159
You good?

36:23.192 --> 36:25.295
Brought some tunes.

36:27.264 --> 36:29.199
Yeah? You got some good shit in here?

36:29.232 --> 36:32.069
My dad was into country and western.

36:32.101 --> 36:34.344
Ah, man.

36:35.470 --> 36:39.164
Are you serious right now, bro?

36:40.276 --> 36:43.011
- Oh... come on.
- Shit!

36:43.044 --> 36:45.113
War's coming!

36:53.321 --> 36:55.548
Come on, man!

36:56.112 --> 36:59.415
Come on, I gotta die
to a good song, brother!

36:59.528 --> 37:01.330
Good song!

37:13.441 --> 37:15.948
I dig it, man.

37:16.253 --> 37:18.889
- I dig it, man.
- It feels right.

37:22.184 --> 37:23.386
This is it.

37:27.200 --> 37:29.090
Hold on a sec, brother!

37:54.316 --> 37:56.752
Titan? Where?

37:56.785 --> 37:58.253
A quarter-mile east.

38:02.390 --> 38:05.199
The last of our enemies is here.

38:05.294 --> 38:08.712
They are weak, vulnerable.

38:08.830 --> 38:12.172
Find them, kill them.

38:12.259 --> 38:15.162
Leave none to...

38:56.144 --> 38:59.014
- That got their attention.
- Let's make sure.

38:59.039 --> 39:01.450
You're set to pop.

39:01.484 --> 39:03.319
How does it work?

39:03.352 --> 39:04.936
Gimme your hand, Louise.

39:04.999 --> 39:06.822
Oh, God.

39:22.261 --> 39:24.206
My God, that was a rush.

39:27.243 --> 39:28.644
Well, that's unfortunate.

39:28.676 --> 39:31.448
- What happened?
- End of an era.

39:32.848 --> 39:35.518
Jones, we're in.

39:35.800 --> 39:37.259
Katarina...

39:37.452 --> 39:39.002
No...

39:39.087 --> 39:41.190
I am standing for this.

39:43.325 --> 39:46.704
Initiate splinter sequence.

40:32.566 --> 40:34.868
Mr. Cole, we are in.

40:40.915 --> 40:43.261
We've walked into a trap.

40:43.944 --> 40:46.414
Splinter Titan.

40:55.493 --> 40:56.933
She's getting ready to splinter.

40:56.966 --> 40:59.368
Initiate temporal disruption pulse.

41:23.392 --> 41:26.190
- What's happening?
- We cannot splinter.

41:26.268 --> 41:28.565
Something's disrupted the towers.

41:28.664 --> 41:30.190
Katarina.

41:30.298 --> 41:33.535
Mr. Cole, Mr. Ramse, it's up to you now.

41:33.548 --> 41:35.499
Take out that power station.

41:35.600 --> 41:38.169
<i>That's the only to stop
the central spire.</i>

41:38.265 --> 41:39.870
Cassie...

41:39.903 --> 41:42.372
We'll head to the mainframe
to finish the Primary code.

41:42.405 --> 41:44.909
See you on the other side.

41:46.242 --> 41:48.910
No matter what, protect the machine.

41:49.680 --> 41:51.332
We'll be back when Titan's ours.

41:51.357 --> 41:53.574
Yeah!

41:53.650 --> 41:55.692
Ready, Freddy?

42:06.204 --> 42:09.207
Okay, we just lost the advantage.

42:09.239 --> 42:11.375
We're outnumbered,
outgunned, and on foot...

42:11.409 --> 42:13.211
and probably gonna die.

42:13.244 --> 42:15.814
Let's do this.

42:15.846 --> 42:19.417
The central spire is capable
of splintering by itself.

42:19.451 --> 42:20.897
We can run.

42:20.922 --> 42:23.085
All we have to do is stop
the sequence and release...

42:23.121 --> 42:25.090
Do not stop the sequence!

42:25.667 --> 42:26.964
It must finish,

42:27.019 --> 42:29.360
or else the process
will reverse entirely.

42:29.393 --> 42:31.128
They don't have the numbers.

42:31.161 --> 42:33.164
Take as many faithful as you can get.

42:33.197 --> 42:36.570
Destroy their machine.
It's the only weapon they have.

42:37.168 --> 42:38.336
Go!
