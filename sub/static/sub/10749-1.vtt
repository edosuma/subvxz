00:45.264 --> 00:46.798
Hope this doesn't embarrass you Jen,

00:46.813 --> 00:48.871
but I found the best thing to do
with the new employee

00:48.936 --> 00:51.992
is to size them up
with a long hard stare.

01:09.697 --> 01:11.058
- So!
- So.

01:11.129 --> 01:12.382
- First day!
- Yes!

01:12.406 --> 01:13.837
- Scary...?
- Yes...

01:13.849 --> 01:16.144
- Don't be scared!
- Oh I'm not really scared.

01:16.181 --> 01:16.735
You should be!

01:16.795 --> 01:18.854
- Well I'm a little bit scared.
- What? Don't be!

01:18.871 --> 01:19.946
Make up your mind!

01:20.912 --> 01:21.897
So here you are!

01:22.896 --> 01:23.365
Yes.

01:23.401 --> 01:25.281
I'm... really looking forward to...

01:25.353 --> 01:27.852
- getting to grips with the...
- I'm gonna put you in I.T.

01:28.030 --> 01:31.223
Because you said on your CV you had
a lot of experience with computers.

01:33.294 --> 01:35.579
I did say that on my CV yes.

01:35.745 --> 01:38.703
I have lots of experience
with the whole...

01:38.814 --> 01:42.413
computer... thing you know, e-mails...

01:42.551 --> 01:47.424
sending e-mails, receiving e-mails,
deleting e-mails...

01:47.701 --> 01:50.863
- ... I could go on.
- Do!

01:51.972 --> 01:56.154
The Web... Using mouse...
mices... using mice.

01:57.295 --> 01:59.835
Clicking... double clicking...

01:59.904 --> 02:03.222
the computer screen of course,
the keyboard...

02:03.416 --> 02:05.541
the...bit that goes on the floor
down there...

02:05.576 --> 02:07.062
- The hard drive?
- Correct.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.768
Well, you certainly seem
to know your stuff.

02:10.086 --> 02:12.613
That settles.
Got a good feeling about you Jen!

02:12.657 --> 02:14.329
And they need a new manager.

02:14.356 --> 02:15.354
Oh fantastic!

02:15.390 --> 02:17.645
So... the people I'll be working with,
what're they like?

02:17.668 --> 02:19.253
Standard nerds!

03:07.630 --> 03:08.525
Hello I.T.?

03:09.392 --> 03:11.135
Have you tried turning it off
and on again?

03:14.024 --> 03:17.127
OK, well, the button on the side,
is it glowing?

03:19.171 --> 03:20.779
Yeah, you need to turn it on!

03:22.865 --> 03:24.939
The button, turns it on?!

03:27.767 --> 03:30.198
Yeah... You... Yeah...

03:30.333 --> 03:33.308
You do know how a button works,
don't you?

03:33.330 --> 03:35.005
No, not on clothes!

03:35.066 --> 03:36.158
Hello, I.T.?

03:37.250 --> 03:38.176
Yeah?

03:39.586 --> 03:42.512
Have you tried forcing
an unexpected reboot?

03:42.529 --> 03:45.156
No, no! There you go! No there you go,
I just heard it come on.

03:46.140 --> 03:48.080
No no, that's the music you hear
when it comes on.

03:48.219 --> 03:49.757
No, that's the music you hear when...

03:50.232 --> 03:52.181
I'm sorry, are you from the past?!

03:52.995 --> 03:56.416
See the driver hooks a function
by patching the system call table.

03:56.451 --> 03:57.758
So it's not safe to unload it,

03:57.768 --> 04:00.403
unless another thread's about
to jump in there and do its stuff.

04:00.470 --> 04:03.557
... and you don't want to end up
in middle of invalid memory.

04:06.238 --> 04:06.831
Hello?

04:07.935 --> 04:11.439
Oh really? Really, why don't you come
down here and make me then?

04:11.563 --> 04:14.355
What? Oh you think I'm afraid of you?
I'm not afraid of you!

04:14.378 --> 04:17.009
You can come down here any time
and I'll be waiting for ya!

04:18.334 --> 04:19.574
That told her!

04:21.512 --> 04:24.769
Oh God, it's about time you got back,
it's been all go.

04:24.814 --> 04:25.672
You had a job?

04:26.157 --> 04:27.431
Girl on fifth...

04:27.493 --> 04:29.484
Did you and her... hit it off?

04:30.348 --> 04:32.118
Define "hit it off"?

04:33.073 --> 04:36.128
Did she continue talking to you
once you'd fixed her computer?

04:37.647 --> 04:38.337
No...

04:39.239 --> 04:42.972
And while I was working on it,
she rested a cup on my back.

04:43.041 --> 04:44.734
- No?!
- Yep!

04:45.868 --> 04:47.072
Unbelievable!

04:47.085 --> 04:50.105
Yeah, I mean they've not respect for us
up there, no respect whatsoever!

04:50.117 --> 04:51.884
We're all just drudgens to them.

04:51.934 --> 04:52.668
Yes!

04:52.803 --> 04:54.694
If there were such a thing as a drudgen,

04:54.763 --> 04:56.233
that is what we'd be to them.

04:56.259 --> 04:57.367
It's like they're pally-wally

04:57.368 --> 04:59.009
when there's a problem
with their printer

04:59.027 --> 05:00.306
but once it's fixed...

05:00.340 --> 05:03.007
They toss us away like yesterday's jam!

05:03.008 --> 05:03.417
Yes!

05:03.486 --> 05:07.322
Yesterday's jam!
That is what we are to them!

05:07.719 --> 05:11.055
Actually you know what?
That doesn't really work as a thing...

05:11.189 --> 05:13.454
because you know, jam lasts for ages...

05:15.362 --> 05:16.980
Hello, I.T. ?

05:17.077 --> 05:19.107
Have you tried turning it off
and on again?

05:21.537 --> 05:26.546
Unisex toilets? You have unisex toilets,
like Ally McBeal?

05:31.360 --> 05:33.496
That's the sort of place this is, Jen.

05:33.526 --> 05:37.854
A lot of sexy people not doing
much work... and having affairs.

05:39.872 --> 05:43.494
Oh my God! Look at that view!

05:46.447 --> 05:48.725
I feel like I'm on top of the world.

05:49.071 --> 05:51.503
Well Jen, this is where I leave you.

05:51.541 --> 05:53.081
<i>Floor 34.</i>

05:53.859 --> 05:57.244
Great sir, thank you.
OK. Where am I going?

05:57.263 --> 06:00.097
All... the way down to the basement.

06:00.136 --> 06:01.911
Good luck!

06:11.975 --> 06:13.669
<i>Get out of the lift...</i>

06:39.488 --> 06:42.465
- Oh. Won't be a tick!
- Oh my God!

06:42.581 --> 06:46.128
Oh  my God! Oh God! OK.

06:55.488 --> 06:56.765
Hello?

06:58.652 --> 07:00.229
Hello?

07:40.323 --> 07:45.617
Yes I believe it was Tolstoy who said...
Oh, it seems we have a visitor.

07:46.687 --> 07:49.184
I'm sorry, myself and Morris
were just engaged

07:49.196 --> 07:51.766
in quite a serious discussion
about books and such.

07:51.816 --> 07:53.646
We didn't hear you come in.

07:54.249 --> 07:56.807
Wait a second, you said it was
Tolstoy, he said what?

07:56.861 --> 07:58.666
Oh never mind that now, Morris!

07:58.757 --> 08:00.446
When have you read Tolstoy?

08:00.745 --> 08:01.907
Shut up, Morris!

08:02.719 --> 08:04.636
Why are you speaking that weird voice?

08:04.651 --> 08:07.410
When did... I don't remember
this conversation at all!

08:09.092 --> 08:11.644
Don't... don't let me disturb you,
I just wanted to come down....

08:12.198 --> 08:14.228
Don't be silly you never dist...

08:20.138 --> 08:23.051
Many people come down here to visit!

08:23.166 --> 08:26.944
What are you talking about?
Who comes down? What people?

08:29.229 --> 08:32.653
Why are you giving me
the secret signal to shut up?!

08:33.799 --> 08:38.168
So... What can we do you for?

08:38.318 --> 08:42.318
I'm the new head of this department.

08:42.751 --> 08:45.095
Is this my office?

08:45.635 --> 08:49.240
Why? What did she... Did she just say...

08:49.384 --> 08:52.448
-  I am the head of this department!
- I thought I was.

08:52.555 --> 08:56.472
It's one of us! Certainly not her!
I'm gonna sort this out...

08:56.520 --> 08:59.024
Roy! You've got a head wound there...
Head wound!

09:00.820 --> 09:01.623
Hi!

09:01.689 --> 09:03.635
I don't wanna be rude or anything

09:03.666 --> 09:07.065
but I wasn't informed of any changes
to this department.

09:07.138 --> 09:09.205
Oh, did they not tell you about me?

09:09.234 --> 09:09.838
No!

09:09.904 --> 09:13.395
And we are perfectly fine down here,
thank you very much,

09:13.431 --> 09:15.817
we're more than capable
of taking care of ourselves.

09:15.829 --> 09:16.844
Sure... sure...

09:16.960 --> 09:18.453
You know you're covered in blood?

09:20.013 --> 09:20.933
Moss!

09:21.745 --> 09:23.000
Amazon thingy.

09:23.089 --> 09:24.462
Ah! Wicked!

09:24.521 --> 09:27.094
I know what this is.
It's the new Harry Potter.

09:27.165 --> 09:30.059
I got the child edition
and the adult edition

09:30.094 --> 09:33.184
just to check that there are
no differences in the text.

09:35.941 --> 09:38.377
Sorry but I'm not gonna be able
to deal with that woman!

09:39.542 --> 09:42.488
Is nobody else going to get the phone?
I suppose I'll get it!

09:42.512 --> 09:45.216
No, that is not a phone.
I'm gonna have a little lie down.

09:50.805 --> 09:51.572
Come in!

09:52.612 --> 09:55.315
Yeah, Denholm. Yeah, yeah.

09:55.924 --> 09:59.132
No no no... No they've been fine so far.

09:59.312 --> 10:02.088
Yeah. I think we're gonna get on great.

10:02.881 --> 10:03.998
Yeah, I know.

10:04.106 --> 10:07.134
All right then, now you take care.
All right, yeah I will, yeah.

10:08.970 --> 10:09.641
Ok!

10:09.701 --> 10:11.956
Ok, take care, take care!

10:12.062 --> 10:13.627
Ok bye! Bye!

10:14.956 --> 10:16.685
Oh, so, hello!

10:16.827 --> 10:20.149
What can I do you fo...
What can I do for you?

10:20.288 --> 10:22.871
Hello. I was just wondering...

10:22.941 --> 10:25.640
Do you want me to connect up your phone?

10:33.627 --> 10:36.188
No no no... No.

10:36.303 --> 10:40.086
It's working.
I was just talking to Denholm.

10:40.143 --> 10:41.548
But how?!

10:41.596 --> 10:45.756
Oh do you mind... Do you mind
closing the door for me?

10:45.963 --> 10:48.109
- Oh yeah, sure.
- Yeah, Ok.

10:49.629 --> 10:50.988
Yeah. From the other side...

10:52.881 --> 10:53.839
Of course.

10:57.326 --> 10:59.072
- Like this?
- That's it!

11:00.143 --> 11:01.842
- With me on the...
- Thanks!

11:12.882 --> 11:14.513
Are you all right?

11:14.638 --> 11:16.962
Oh yes, Moss, I'm fine!

11:16.979 --> 11:19.788
The nurse said I didn't do myself
any serious damage.

11:19.833 --> 11:21.027
I'm standing over here!

11:21.040 --> 11:23.564
I know, I know, I'm joking, I'm fine!

11:23.633 --> 11:24.791
What we gonna do about her?

11:24.947 --> 11:28.679
Well, I just went in, and she was having
a pretend conversation.

11:28.818 --> 11:30.235
- Really?
- Yes.

11:30.260 --> 11:33.812
She's a little bit weird...
to say the least.

11:35.152 --> 11:35.992
What's that?

11:36.078 --> 11:38.370
Oh just water.
Sometimes, I get a hot ear,

11:38.414 --> 11:39.839
and this helps cool it down.

11:40.723 --> 11:42.953
She is quite the oddbod...

11:43.448 --> 11:45.867
Did you notice how
she didn't even get excited

11:45.868 --> 11:47.720
when  she saw this original ZX-IT 1?

11:47.817 --> 11:49.669
Yeah, that was weird.

11:49.712 --> 11:52.072
It's almost as if she doesn't know
anything about computers.

11:52.128 --> 11:52.917
What?!

11:54.723 --> 11:55.515
Look what you did!

11:55.598 --> 11:58.038
Oh don't worry that's why
I always make 2 cups of tea.

11:59.310 --> 12:00.720
Anyway, what were we talking about?

12:00.730 --> 12:02.691
Oh, her not knowing anything
about computers.

12:02.744 --> 12:03.434
What?!

12:08.284 --> 12:10.726
"Dear sir, stroke, madam."

12:10.779 --> 12:12.858
"Fire!" Exclamation mark.

12:12.946 --> 12:15.789
"Fire!" Exclamation mark.

12:15.822 --> 12:18.229
"Help me!" Exclamation mark.

12:18.273 --> 12:20.584
"123, Carendon Road."

12:20.651 --> 12:23.139
"Looking forward to hearing from you!"

12:23.217 --> 12:25.531
"All the best, Morris Moss."

12:25.548 --> 12:27.655
<i>The IT Crowd continues next!</i>

12:32.704 --> 12:34.596
<i>I definitely want to get rid of her.</i>

12:34.711 --> 12:36.026
I agree yeah.

12:36.110 --> 12:38.242
Ok, so, here's the plan:

12:38.477 --> 12:42.458
A plan? Let me put on
my slightly larger glasses.

12:47.389 --> 12:48.901
Ok, hit me!

12:49.549 --> 12:51.255
- Ok. We go in...
- When?

12:52.697 --> 12:54.079
You know, like in a minute.

12:54.204 --> 12:56.402
Will that be enough time for me
to get to know the plan?

12:57.620 --> 13:00.039
Yeah, you know what?
I shouldn't have used the word "plan"!

13:00.067 --> 13:02.223
I... I've clearly gotten you
over-excited!

13:02.265 --> 13:04.131
Would "steamed" be a better word?

13:04.173 --> 13:07.189
Although that's just as exciting,
I might even use these.

13:11.976 --> 13:14.173
All I was gonna say was...

13:14.242 --> 13:17.697
We go in, I make up a load of bullocks
about computers

13:17.704 --> 13:19.184
and we'll see if she picks up on it.

13:22.463 --> 13:25.046
Yes. I can see why
you didn't want to use the word "plan".

13:26.419 --> 13:27.368
Let me do the talk.

13:27.396 --> 13:28.040
All right.

13:29.923 --> 13:30.999
Ouh, Moss, Moss Moss!

13:31.572 --> 13:33.736
Ok, we need to get this right, you know?

13:33.834 --> 13:35.991
We... we need to stay calm.

13:36.113 --> 13:38.535
We do not wanna go in there half-cocked.

13:51.029 --> 13:52.157
Hang on, guys.

13:53.705 --> 13:55.022
How can I help?

13:55.087 --> 13:57.863
Well, we were just wondering
now that you're "The Boss",

13:57.985 --> 14:00.147
would you like us to access
the data supplier

14:00.173 --> 14:01.538
and connect you up to the matrix?

14:04.580 --> 14:07.068
You just made all that up?

14:08.135 --> 14:10.588
You don't know anything
about computers, admit it!

14:10.599 --> 14:14.649
Will you stop trying to undermine me!
Now get in there,

14:14.697 --> 14:17.460
and do some work, to do with computers!

14:17.902 --> 14:20.626
I'll be in there in a minute
and check up on you!

14:21.029 --> 14:22.951
Ok, lady!

14:23.006 --> 14:26.352
You've won this round, but we can wait!

14:26.656 --> 14:28.596
You will slip up one day,

14:28.665 --> 14:31.119
and believe you me,
we will be there when you do!

14:31.158 --> 14:33.160
There will be some piece of evidence
that will prove

14:33.163 --> 14:34.307
without  any shadow of a doubt

14:34.308 --> 14:36.160
that you don't know
anything about computers.

14:36.195 --> 14:37.334
What are you doing?

14:38.034 --> 14:40.221
Plugging in your computer.

14:41.770 --> 14:43.680
It might be something you say...

14:43.763 --> 14:45.299
or something you do!

14:45.769 --> 14:49.310
But when we notice this,
and believe me we will notice this,

14:49.319 --> 14:51.912
there's gonna be a long way down
for you, sweet chicks!

14:56.933 --> 14:58.815
He'll  realise in a second...

15:08.045 --> 15:11.098
I cannot believe you're going
to tell on me.

15:11.231 --> 15:14.718
You're like a pair of horrible
old women.

15:15.050 --> 15:16.223
What did she say?

15:17.172 --> 15:18.843
She said we're like horrible old women.

15:18.932 --> 15:20.127
She didn't!

15:20.835 --> 15:22.009
Hey guys!

15:22.247 --> 15:23.485
Ok, got something to tell me?

15:23.487 --> 15:25.181
Yes, well, it's like this:

15:25.269 --> 15:27.649
Look at you! My I.T. Team.

15:27.926 --> 15:30.028
- Yeah.
- Team players each and every one of you.

15:30.036 --> 15:31.038
Yeah, what she...

15:31.051 --> 15:33.570
There's no room for people
who can't act in a team on my team!

15:33.930 --> 15:35.112
Excuse me.

15:35.281 --> 15:36.464
Hello?

15:36.717 --> 15:37.772
What?!

15:38.378 --> 15:40.517
Well if you can't work as a team,
you're all fired!

15:40.779 --> 15:43.281
That's it, you heard me, fine!
Get your things and go!

15:45.173 --> 15:46.013
Hello, Security?

15:46.472 --> 15:48.126
Everyone on floor 4 is fired.

15:48.662 --> 15:49.873
Escort them from the premises.

15:49.994 --> 15:50.997
And do it as a team!

15:51.118 --> 15:54.013
Remember you're a team, and if you can't
act as a team, you're fired too!

15:55.497 --> 15:56.175
Dawn!

15:56.446 --> 15:59.005
Get onto recruitment.
Tell them to look for a security team

15:59.006 --> 15:59.986
that can work as team.

16:00.474 --> 16:02.869
They may have to escort our
security team from the building,

16:02.944 --> 16:05.173
for not acting like a team!

16:06.518 --> 16:10.233
Team! Team team team team team!

16:10.537 --> 16:12.294
I even love saying the word "team".

16:13.546 --> 16:15.489
You probably think that's a picture
of my family?

16:17.394 --> 16:18.430
It's the A-Team.

16:19.755 --> 16:23.196
Body, Doyle, Tiger, the Jewellery Man!

16:23.591 --> 16:24.753
All of them!

16:26.007 --> 16:27.596
So what do you wanna tell me?

16:27.654 --> 16:29.218
Well, it's just not working out.

16:31.307 --> 16:33.065
- He's joking!
- But you said...

16:33.106 --> 16:34.172
Not working out?

16:34.200 --> 16:35.902
Oh no! No!

16:35.985 --> 16:38.334
We are getting on like
a big house on fire!

16:38.360 --> 16:40.188
- Yeah!
- My ear's getting hot!

16:42.041 --> 16:45.008
No... You know what?
We should leave, now, because

16:45.163 --> 16:46.461
you know, you're a busy man

16:46.473 --> 16:48.491
and we've taken far too much
of your time.

16:48.499 --> 16:50.308
Jen could you just get the door
for me there?

16:50.327 --> 16:51.360
Absolutely Roy!

16:51.379 --> 16:53.125
So why did you come here
in the first place?

16:55.695 --> 16:59.620
We set up a voice activation system
on your computer.

16:59.709 --> 17:01.209
I think you're gonna enjoy it.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.955
It might just take a little while
to get the pitch right on the voice

17:03.972 --> 17:06.106
but nonetheless, go ahead!
Thank you very much!

17:06.124 --> 17:07.202
- Bye bye!
- Thank you!

17:07.525 --> 17:08.657
How exciting!

17:12.335 --> 17:13.169
Hello...

17:16.554 --> 17:17.742
Hello computer!

17:21.655 --> 17:22.843
Hello!

17:24.722 --> 17:27.441
Hello... Hello computer...

17:30.071 --> 17:32.135
What good are you?

17:32.143 --> 17:34.757
You obviously don't know anything
about computers.

17:34.784 --> 17:36.158
No but... OK.

17:36.197 --> 17:37.543
But I can learn.

17:37.650 --> 17:40.679
You know, I mean, for example Moss,

17:40.725 --> 17:42.849
you could take me through
what you're doing right now.

17:42.905 --> 17:44.077
I'd be delighted!

17:44.353 --> 17:47.249
I'm just working on a very simple piece
of programming code.

17:55.541 --> 17:56.842
I see...

17:57.987 --> 18:00.789
Oh God, no, I'm lying again!
I didn't understand any of that!

18:00.796 --> 18:03.080
I don't know anything
about computers, I mean...

18:03.139 --> 18:07.188
I'm absolutely useless to you.
I might as well pack up and go home.

18:09.224 --> 18:13.049
Hi! Is... Roy around?

18:13.553 --> 18:15.222
Hello there little lady!

18:15.307 --> 18:18.788
Are you lost?
How can I help you? I'm Roy.

18:21.130 --> 18:22.609
You wanted me to come down?!

18:23.718 --> 18:24.772
Well here I am!!

18:24.777 --> 18:26.176
Not the face!!

18:26.902 --> 18:28.223
Not the face!!

18:28.361 --> 18:30.747
Well maybe this will teach you

18:30.774 --> 18:33.308
to treat people with
a little bit of respect!

18:34.590 --> 18:37.490
Is it 'cos we spoke on the phone
earlier?

18:38.643 --> 18:41.181
Oh my God! Are those Manolo's?

18:41.237 --> 18:41.843
Yes!

18:41.932 --> 18:44.645
They are gorgeous! Were they expensive?

18:44.697 --> 18:46.899
No, no no no! Got them in a sale.

18:46.941 --> 18:48.213
Oh God! Clever you!

18:48.220 --> 18:50.147
I'm never lucky enough
to get a bargain myself.

18:50.159 --> 18:51.714
Well, I should take you shopping.

18:51.738 --> 18:53.678
Yeah, no that would be fantastic.

18:53.725 --> 18:56.143
Oh I will give you a call.
Nice to meet you! Take care!

18:56.186 --> 18:59.735
- Nice meeting you!
- Chairman! Wow!

18:59.805 --> 19:02.270
You just diffuse that entire situation!

19:02.341 --> 19:03.566
What situation?

19:03.784 --> 19:07.877
Oh oh, that.. yeah!
Oh my God, does that happen a lot?

19:08.097 --> 19:11.024
They're fairly regular,
the beatings, yes.

19:11.117 --> 19:13.504
I'd say we're on a by-weekly beatings.

19:13.578 --> 19:15.235
Ah it's not all that bad!

19:15.293 --> 19:17.969
Ah, come on Roy! It's pretty bad...

19:18.443 --> 19:21.289
Maybe I could help with this.
You know, I mean...

19:21.528 --> 19:23.627
I'm a people person and...

19:23.739 --> 19:26.311
people like you need a person
to deal with people...

19:26.344 --> 19:28.996
a people person like me. Oh my God!

19:29.154 --> 19:31.883
Ideas are coming!
Things are happening here!

19:31.920 --> 19:33.946
Ok, Ok, what would you say here,

19:34.095 --> 19:36.269
if I told you that I had a plan

19:36.332 --> 19:40.320
to raise your profile upstairs by 100%.
What would you say?

19:40.479 --> 19:42.325
I can't be done! You're crazy!

19:42.380 --> 19:46.090
What would you say Roy?
Roy's passed out! Ok!

19:46.314 --> 19:49.574
I need a felt-tip pen, and some paper.

20:12.803 --> 20:15.918
PARTY - I.T. DEPT 5.45 TODAY

20:18.387 --> 20:24.974
No no! Oh no, really really really,
that was a true story!

20:25.041 --> 20:26.412
Unbelievable!

20:26.605 --> 20:29.495
I said why we don't go out
with the I.T. guys more often?

20:29.548 --> 20:31.821
- You're hilarious!
- Yes we are!

20:33.671 --> 20:36.272
You guys should come down here
more often you know,

20:36.431 --> 20:38.977
you should see this as a new era
for Reynholm Industries.

20:39.018 --> 20:40.864
"A new era for Reynholm Industries!"

20:42.558 --> 20:45.346
Oh Do you know what! If you want
to hear something really funny,

20:45.352 --> 20:46.501
a really funny story,

20:46.516 --> 20:48.205
you should hear what happened
to Moss and I,

20:48.224 --> 20:49.898
when we were so drunk in Amsterdam

20:49.921 --> 20:51.838
that Moss lost his glasses!

20:52.456 --> 20:54.068
Moss! Moss!

20:54.745 --> 20:55.661
Come here! Come here!

20:55.759 --> 20:58.579
Tell them that story about
when we were drunk in Amsterdam.

20:58.609 --> 20:59.257
Really?

20:59.384 --> 21:00.850
Yeah yeah yeah! Oh it's brilliant!

21:00.872 --> 21:02.691
Oh this a great story,
you're gonna love it!

21:02.761 --> 21:04.545
I'm just gonna get another box of wine!

21:06.634 --> 21:07.911
Well go on, then.

21:09.607 --> 21:10.818
All right.

21:11.970 --> 21:15.962
- Well, one night, we were really drunk.
- Yeah.

21:16.203 --> 21:21.370
And  huh, we were so drunk
that we decided to hire prostitutes.

21:22.916 --> 21:26.154
And when they arrived to the hotel,
we were too scared to do anything,

21:26.199 --> 21:27.936
so we brought them to the fair.

21:28.826 --> 21:31.712
Oh really nice! In the end,
they only charged us half.

21:31.803 --> 21:33.844
But we did have to pay
for all the rides.

21:40.158 --> 21:43.136
Oh isn't that just the best story?

21:43.348 --> 21:44.775
Oh, man!

21:44.993 --> 21:47.239
You told me to never tell that story
to anyone.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.512
Well, what're you talking about?
That's a brilliant story!

21:49.542 --> 21:51.162
And then you nearly walked
into the canal!

21:51.185 --> 21:53.023
Has it got to that part
with the boatman?

21:56.685 --> 21:59.821
Do you mean the story
when I lost my glasses?

22:03.645 --> 22:04.856
Yes!

22:09.131 --> 22:11.573
What story did you think I mean?

22:12.406 --> 22:13.570
Moss?

22:15.022 --> 22:18.352
What did you say?! What did you say?!

22:20.568 --> 22:22.113
It's all right for you two.

22:23.077 --> 22:25.605
You're used to being social social piranhas...

22:28.883 --> 22:31.946
I'm a very popular person usually.

22:31.975 --> 22:36.887
That girl earlier, that tried
to beat me to death with her shoes,

22:37.113 --> 22:38.947
did anybody get her number?

22:40.003 --> 22:42.398
That was a nice day the fair, wasn't it?

22:45.074 --> 22:47.204
With Brandy and Crystal!

22:50.477 --> 22:51.850
Hello I.T.?

22:53.452 --> 22:56.228
Yeah. Have you tried turning it off
and on again?

23:27.639 --> 23:30.476
