fore!

01:18.145 --> 01:20.378
We're playing
through here.

01:20.447 --> 01:22.581
Ah...Where'd it
go, gilligan?

01:22.650 --> 01:25.350
There it is, Mr. howell.
I knew I'd find it!

01:25.419 --> 01:28.220
Oh! Ho-ho.
Well, good work,
gilligan.

01:28.288 --> 01:29.655
I never thought I'd
see that one again.

01:29.723 --> 01:30.989
Now, where am I?

01:31.057 --> 01:32.658
Well, there's
your avocado pit,
Mr. howell.

01:32.726 --> 01:34.393
I don't know where we are.
What do you mean?

01:34.461 --> 01:36.195
I found your ball,
but I lost
the golf course.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.764
Lost the golf course!
And you call yourself a caddie.

01:38.832 --> 01:39.965
No, I don't. You do.

01:40.034 --> 01:41.066
Well, I'll never
make that mistake again.

01:41.134 --> 01:42.600
Now just stand back.

01:42.669 --> 01:44.103
There you are.

01:45.538 --> 01:46.771
Where'd it go,
gilligan?!

01:46.840 --> 01:48.473
Right there.

01:48.542 --> 01:51.276
Oh, there. Yes, yes.
Of course. I shanked it.

01:53.546 --> 01:56.515
Watch it, gilligan.
Call time.

01:57.751 --> 01:58.916
Which way did it go?

01:58.985 --> 02:00.318
Don't worry.
I'll find it.

02:00.387 --> 02:01.653
Yes. I think
i sliced it
over there.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.791
I wonder where
it is. Huh.

02:07.427 --> 02:09.527
I wonder if it could
be down...

02:09.596 --> 02:11.497
Therrrrre!

02:15.602 --> 02:18.736
Gilligan! Gilligan,
my boy, where are you?

02:18.805 --> 02:20.905
Hey, Mr. howell,
i found your ball.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.041
Ho-ho, yes, yes!
There you are.

02:23.110 --> 02:24.843
Wait'll you get
back home and tell
'em about this.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.311
You made
a cave-in-one.

02:26.380 --> 02:29.581
Yes. I also
sank the caddie
with the same shot.

02:29.649 --> 02:30.682
Sank the cad--

02:30.751 --> 02:33.652
gilligan, what's
that yellow stuff?

02:33.721 --> 02:34.986
What yellow stuff?

02:35.055 --> 02:37.155
That yellow stuff
all over the wall.

02:37.223 --> 02:40.558
Oh...Oh...

02:40.627 --> 02:43.094
You mean
this yellow stuff
that looks like gold?

02:43.163 --> 02:44.496
Yes, yes. What is it?

02:44.565 --> 02:47.899
Uh...I think it is gold.

02:47.968 --> 02:50.535
Gold? Gold?!

02:50.604 --> 02:52.237
Aaaaah!

02:55.275 --> 02:57.142
Gold, gilligan!

02:57.211 --> 02:58.844
I'm richer.

02:58.913 --> 03:01.914
I'm hurt a little...
But I'm richer!

03:12.559 --> 03:14.158
Oh. We lost
the bait again.

03:14.227 --> 03:16.027
Oh. How many little fishes
do we have left?

03:16.096 --> 03:17.228
Just one.

03:17.297 --> 03:18.663
How many did we have
when we started?

03:18.731 --> 03:19.965
24.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.499
You mean we've
lost 23 already?!

03:21.568 --> 03:22.500
Mm-hmm.

03:22.569 --> 03:23.768
If we hadn't
gone fishing,

03:23.837 --> 03:25.671
we could have had
fish for dinner.

03:32.079 --> 03:33.678
Hey! I think we
got a big one.

03:33.747 --> 03:34.479
Hey!

03:34.548 --> 03:36.481
It feels like a whale.

03:36.549 --> 03:39.016
Ho ho!
It's tremendous.

03:39.085 --> 03:40.585
Play him, girls!
Play him!

03:40.654 --> 03:42.520
Don't let him go now.
Here, I'll take it.

03:42.589 --> 03:44.389
Wow, you have
got a big one.

03:44.458 --> 03:47.092
Oh, be careful.

03:47.161 --> 03:49.093
Don't worry, ladies,
I'll land him.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.095
He's putting up
a good fight,

03:51.164 --> 03:53.698
but I think I've
got his number now.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.199
Pull!

03:55.268 --> 03:56.501
Aah!

03:57.805 --> 03:58.803
Pull!

03:58.872 --> 04:00.972
Watch his teeth.
Be careful, skipper.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.507
Now stand back,
stand back.

04:02.575 --> 04:05.711
Whatever it is
might be playing possum.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.582
Oh, he's picking it up!

04:10.651 --> 04:13.718
Hallelujah, ladies!
We're saved! We're saved!

04:13.787 --> 04:15.387
We've got
a rubber life raft!

04:15.455 --> 04:16.788
[Squeals]

04:16.857 --> 04:18.589
Skipper, oh!

04:18.658 --> 04:20.524
What a fish story
this'll make--

04:20.593 --> 04:21.692
catching
our own life raft.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.027
Off your boat?

04:23.096 --> 04:24.496
Yeah. It's
the first time

04:24.565 --> 04:27.332
anybody ever
caught a <i> minnow</i>
with a <i> minnow.</i>

04:29.236 --> 04:30.368
How do we know
it's gold?

04:30.437 --> 04:31.969
Don't you have to make
a test to be sure?

04:32.038 --> 04:34.939
I already have.
It's the best test
in the world.

04:35.008 --> 04:36.508
You're shaking
like a leaf.

04:36.577 --> 04:37.842
My doctors call it
my gold syndrome.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.677
Syndrome?
Yes. It's
an allergy.

04:39.746 --> 04:41.747
Oh. Allergy?

04:41.815 --> 04:43.181
Yes, an allergy.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.784
See, anytime i
get near anything
over 24 karats...

04:45.853 --> 04:47.052
I break out.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.420
Boy, I can't wait
to tell the professor
about this

04:49.489 --> 04:51.056
and the skipper
and the girls.
We'll all be rich.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.091
Oh?
Don't you remember?

04:53.160 --> 04:54.826
We all made an agreement
to share everything
on the island.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.962
Yes, I do recall
making that agreement,

04:58.031 --> 05:00.465
but of course,
then we didn't expect
to find a gold mine.

05:00.533 --> 05:03.034
Understand? Don't you know
what gold does
to people, gilligan?

05:03.103 --> 05:04.536
Uh-huh--
makes 'em rich!

05:04.605 --> 05:05.737
Makes 'em greedy.

05:05.806 --> 05:06.904
Greedy?

05:06.973 --> 05:07.706
Greedy!

05:07.775 --> 05:09.774
What can we do,
Mr. howell?

05:09.843 --> 05:12.543
Well, we're gonna
keep this gold mine
our secret.

05:12.612 --> 05:15.380
Scout's honor,
i won't breathe
a word to anybody.

05:15.448 --> 05:16.881
We'll just leave
this filthy gold
where it is.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.483
Yes...No, no!

05:18.552 --> 05:19.984
We can't take
that chance, you see?

05:20.053 --> 05:22.220
One of the others might fall
in the hole, like you,

05:22.288 --> 05:23.955
and--heh heh--
that'll be that.

05:24.023 --> 05:26.458
Gosh, you're always thinking
of the other fellow.

05:26.526 --> 05:28.126
Well, I'm
a multi-millionaire.

05:28.195 --> 05:29.527
My life
is ruined already.

05:29.596 --> 05:31.429
We have to protect
our poor friends.

05:31.498 --> 05:32.697
How, Mr. howell?

05:32.766 --> 05:35.166
I'm gonna hire you
to mine the gold.

05:35.235 --> 05:37.835
I won't pay you
enough to cause you
any trouble.

05:37.904 --> 05:40.572
Then I'll hide it
so no one will ever
be able to find it.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.039
Promise you won't tell me
where you put it?

05:42.108 --> 05:43.141
Scout's honor.

05:43.210 --> 05:44.810
It's 3.

05:47.580 --> 05:49.514
Fore! All clear.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.048
Now don't forget, gilligan.

05:51.117 --> 05:52.950
I'll see you first thing
in the morning at the, uh,

05:53.019 --> 05:53.752
you know what.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.520
You know what?
You know what!

05:55.589 --> 05:57.122
Oh, the gold--
arrgh!

05:57.190 --> 06:00.025
Gilligan,
there you are--
hello, Mr. howell.

06:00.094 --> 06:01.526
Where have you
been?!

06:01.595 --> 06:02.894
Oh, Mr. howell and I,
we were over there having--

06:02.963 --> 06:04.262
never mind, gilligan.
Guess what I found.

06:04.330 --> 06:05.730
You could guess
all day long,

06:05.799 --> 06:06.531
and you still
wouldn't be able
to guess.

06:06.599 --> 06:07.899
Give us a hint.

06:07.968 --> 06:08.967
Well, it's an answer
to all our problems,

06:09.035 --> 06:10.335
all our prayers.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.169
Oh, what I found's
gonna make your mouths
water.

06:12.238 --> 06:13.104
You've found a gold mine!

06:13.173 --> 06:14.205
[Crack]

06:14.274 --> 06:15.507
Ow!

06:15.575 --> 06:16.975
No, gilligan.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.776
We caught our own life raft
from the <i> minnow.</i>

06:18.845 --> 06:20.045
We're gonna
be able to get off
this island!

06:20.113 --> 06:21.213
Oh! Then we're saved!

06:21.281 --> 06:22.680
Oh, boy! This is
our lucky day.

06:22.749 --> 06:24.081
Mr. howell and I,
know what we fou--
[Crack]

06:24.150 --> 06:25.283
Ow!

06:25.351 --> 06:26.618
I'm sorry, gilligan.

06:26.687 --> 06:27.752
When do we leave, skipper,
tomorrow?

06:27.821 --> 06:29.120
I'm ready to leave
right now.

06:29.189 --> 06:30.354
Oh, not so fast,
gilligan.

06:30.423 --> 06:31.222
We got a lot
of work to do
on the raft.

06:31.291 --> 06:32.423
She's full of holes.

06:32.492 --> 06:33.591
Oh, I'm glad
to hear that!
Glad?

06:33.660 --> 06:35.460
Oh! I mean that
you're gonna fix it.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.162
Oh, don't you worry
about that, Mr. howell.

06:37.231 --> 06:38.996
She'll be safe and sound
when we all get
on board.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.264
I'm sure of it, captain.

06:40.333 --> 06:41.466
I've sailed with you before,

06:41.535 --> 06:43.167
and I know what
you can do with a boat.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.602
Thanks, Mr. howell.

06:44.671 --> 06:47.572
You handled our shipwreck
magnificently.

06:47.640 --> 06:48.907
Well...Anyway,
gilligan,

06:48.975 --> 06:50.675
I want you up
and on the beach

06:50.744 --> 06:51.809
first thing
in the morning
ready to work.

06:51.878 --> 06:53.378
Oh, but I promised
Mr. howell

06:53.447 --> 06:54.512
I'd go down
and dig him--

06:54.581 --> 06:55.380
[crack]
Ooh!

06:55.448 --> 06:56.615
Missed me.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.951
Lovey, have I got news.
News?

07:01.020 --> 07:03.588
Yes. I've discovered
a gold mine
on this island.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.857
Oh, that's wonderful.
There's only one complication.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.626
I don't think
we'll be able
to mine the gold.

07:07.694 --> 07:08.726
Oh, that's dreadful.

07:08.795 --> 07:09.994
The skipper
found a raft,

07:10.063 --> 07:11.396
and it looks like
we'll be rescued.

07:11.465 --> 07:12.831
Oh, that's wonderful.

07:12.899 --> 07:14.332
So we won't have
time to mine
the gold.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.067
Oh, that's dreadful.

07:16.136 --> 07:19.003
Gilligan has to work
all day on the boat
for the skipper.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.137
L-l-lovey!

07:20.206 --> 07:21.472
Oh, I'm sorry, thurston.

07:21.541 --> 07:23.307
Where were we,
dreadful or wonderful?

07:23.376 --> 07:26.311
If that boy has to
work day and night,
it's dreadful.

07:26.380 --> 07:27.545
Quite right, thurston.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.280
You know what would
be wonderful?

07:29.349 --> 07:31.282
It would be wonderful
if you would go down
into that mine

07:31.350 --> 07:32.684
and help that boy dig.

07:32.752 --> 07:35.654
Oh, dear. We're back
at dreadful again.

07:37.524 --> 07:40.291
Oh, good morning,
captain.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.792
How's the work
coming?

07:41.861 --> 07:43.662
The work is coming
along fine, Mr. howell.

07:43.730 --> 07:44.529
Oh.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.030
Something
i can do for you?

07:46.099 --> 07:47.665
Yes. I would
like a few words
with gilligan.

07:47.734 --> 07:49.300
Well, make it
very few, would you?

07:49.369 --> 07:50.668
He's got a lot
of work to do.

07:50.737 --> 07:52.771
Yes, yes,
i understand.
Thank you.

07:54.608 --> 07:57.142
Gilligan.
Gilligan, my boy.

07:59.479 --> 08:01.079
Oh, hi, Mr. howell.

08:02.615 --> 08:04.749
Gilligan,
are you alright?

08:04.818 --> 08:05.616
Sure.

08:05.685 --> 08:07.518
But you look
sort of strained.

08:07.587 --> 08:09.020
I haven't done
this kind of work
in a long time,

08:09.088 --> 08:10.588
and I'm a little
out of shape.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.590
I'll say you are.

08:12.659 --> 08:13.958
Sorry about today,

08:14.027 --> 08:15.727
but I couldn't say
no to the skipper.

08:15.796 --> 08:18.229
You will be able
to make it tonight,
won't you?

08:18.297 --> 08:19.864
Oh, sure thing.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.465
As soon as the skipper
goes to sleep,
I'll leave.

08:21.534 --> 08:24.502
Yes, you'll be able
to do a lot of fine
digging before dawn.

08:24.571 --> 08:25.971
Okay. I'll see
you tonight.

08:26.039 --> 08:28.673
Gilligan,
I'm worried about you.

08:28.742 --> 08:29.974
Oh, don't worry,
Mr. howell.

08:30.043 --> 08:31.710
I'm kind of in
tight quarters here,

08:31.778 --> 08:33.812
but I move around
a lot. I'm okay, see?

08:33.880 --> 08:37.315
Fantastic! Remind me
when we get back
to the states,

08:37.383 --> 08:40.719
I want to talk to you
about <i> the ed Sullivan show.</i>

08:43.289 --> 08:44.789
Heh heh heh.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.125
His...Head and...

08:51.631 --> 08:53.431
What was that
all about?

08:53.500 --> 08:56.901
Oh. Mr. howell is gonna
put me on television on
<i> the ed Sullivan show.</i>

08:56.970 --> 08:59.003
Doing what?
I don't know.

08:59.071 --> 09:01.773
Maybe Mr. Sullivan's
boat needs fixing.

09:05.311 --> 09:08.446
Hey, gilligan,
we did a pretty good
day's work, eh?

09:08.514 --> 09:10.248
Makes you feel real good,
doesn't it?

09:10.317 --> 09:11.449
Sure does.

09:11.517 --> 09:13.284
I wanna tell you,
that mother nature,

09:13.353 --> 09:14.919
there's a pretty
great old gal.

09:14.987 --> 09:16.787
She lets you work
all day long,

09:16.856 --> 09:20.091
and then all of a sudden,
she rings a bell and says,

09:20.160 --> 09:21.926
"you've had enough.
It's time to sleep."

09:21.994 --> 09:26.697
Yup. Mother nature's
a great old...Gal.

09:26.766 --> 09:29.901
[Yawns and snores]

09:35.375 --> 09:37.575
Hey, gilligan,
gilligan.

09:37.643 --> 09:38.810
[Moans]
Hey.

09:45.919 --> 09:49.954
There we are--
exactly 32 ounces
of gold.

09:50.023 --> 09:51.923
Mr. howell, are you sure
that scale is right?

09:51.991 --> 09:54.326
Oh, certainly.
Mrs. howell's
engagement ring

09:54.394 --> 09:55.626
weighs exactly
one pound.

09:55.695 --> 09:57.462
I'm using it as
a counterweight.

09:57.531 --> 09:59.464
You want me
to dig anymore?

09:59.533 --> 10:00.965
Certainly.
It's only 4 A.M.

10:01.034 --> 10:03.968
Is that all? There's
probably a lot more
gold in here.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.337
You can thank
mother nature
for that.

10:06.406 --> 10:08.005
You thank her,
huh, Mr. howell?

10:08.074 --> 10:10.875
You and the skipper
know her a lot better
than I do.

10:14.914 --> 10:16.381
Folks, if I might
have your attention.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.016
I just want you
to know

10:18.085 --> 10:19.984
we're getting
that raft ready as
soon as possible.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.152
Not so fast,
captain.

10:21.220 --> 10:22.587
I think you ought
to make sure

10:22.656 --> 10:24.089
it's safe first,
don't you?

10:24.157 --> 10:26.357
Quite right, thurston.
You all know
the old saying--

10:26.426 --> 10:28.993
"a stitch in time..."
Uh, "stitch in time..."

10:29.062 --> 10:30.829
Well, you all know
the old saying.

10:30.897 --> 10:32.496
There's no point
in repeating it.

10:32.565 --> 10:34.732
How long do you
think it'll take,
skipper?

10:34.801 --> 10:36.668
Don't ask me.
Ask gilligan.

10:37.904 --> 10:39.136
Oh, leave the
poor boy alone.

10:39.205 --> 10:40.371
He's trying to drink
some water.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.273
No, he isn't.
He's asleep.

10:42.342 --> 10:43.574
Wake up,
gilligan!

10:43.643 --> 10:45.175
It's your turn
to get up first.

10:45.244 --> 10:48.146
I got up first yesterday.
It's your turn.

10:48.214 --> 10:49.914
Asleep again.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.016
Yes. I guess I better
get him back to bed.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.318
Never mind.
We'll put him
nighty-night.

10:54.387 --> 10:55.487
Come on, lovey.

10:55.555 --> 10:57.389
Lovey, dear,
you take
the other arm.

10:57.457 --> 10:59.123
I will, just as soon
as I can get

10:59.191 --> 11:01.859
this cup of guava jelly
off his elbow.

11:01.928 --> 11:03.027
Nighty-night.

11:03.095 --> 11:05.696
We've got to give him
his Teddy bear.

11:05.765 --> 11:10.001
Hah! Come on,
sandyman is coming.
Nighty-night.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.602
What do you suppose is
the matter with gilligan?

11:11.671 --> 11:13.237
I've never seen him
so tired.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.206
What do you suppose
is the matter
with Mr. howell?

11:15.275 --> 11:17.207
I've never seen him
so considerate.

11:17.276 --> 11:21.446
You know, they don't
seem very anxious
to get the raft fixed.

11:28.955 --> 11:31.890
Gilligan...Shh, shh!
Dig, dig.

11:37.997 --> 11:40.765
Come, gilligan, my boy.
That's it. Up and at 'em.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.900
Off we go
to the mine to dig.

11:42.969 --> 11:45.403
Shh--no, no, son.
You'll be alright.

11:45.471 --> 11:48.239
Down that way to the mine.
There you go.

11:51.011 --> 11:55.346
Now, let me see. If he
mines 16 ingots tonight--

11:55.415 --> 11:59.751
he's a willing boy.
He's got a strong back.

11:59.819 --> 12:05.256
No labor problem there.
Salary...Well, we'll
just cut him in.

12:05.325 --> 12:08.293
The smelting costs are
absolutely negligible,

12:08.361 --> 12:11.696
but the shipping--
howell enterprises
should gross 6 billion.

12:11.764 --> 12:14.632
Put that into lovey's name
in a dummy corporation...

12:14.700 --> 12:16.800
Oh, well, oh, well...

12:16.869 --> 12:19.270
Counting my money
made me sleepy.

12:33.686 --> 12:34.785
Oh-duh-duhh--

12:34.854 --> 12:37.455
oh-oh-ohhhh!

12:40.860 --> 12:42.593
Hi, skipper.
Glad you dropped in.

12:42.662 --> 12:45.496
Gilligan--oh! Ohh!

12:45.565 --> 12:46.630
What is that?

12:46.699 --> 12:48.299
A one-pound
diamond ring.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.668
So that's what
you've been up to.

12:50.737 --> 12:51.970
You've got
a diamond mine.

12:52.038 --> 12:53.837
No. That belongs
to Mrs. howell.

12:53.906 --> 12:55.339
Well, what are you
doing down here?

12:55.408 --> 12:57.008
Well, I...

12:57.076 --> 12:59.343
And what's
all this stuff
all over the walls?

12:59.412 --> 13:00.344
Gold.

13:00.413 --> 13:01.278
Gold?!

13:01.347 --> 13:02.847
Gold?! Gold?!
Gold?!

13:12.893 --> 13:14.391
And that's
the story, folks.

13:14.460 --> 13:15.860
I was up till
5:30 this morning
with Mr. howell,

13:15.929 --> 13:17.328
and he wouldn't
give an inch.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.096
So we might
just as well finish
working on the raft.

13:19.165 --> 13:21.031
Gilligan's dug
a lot of gold
out of that mine.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.100
Doesn't he get any?

13:22.168 --> 13:23.334
No, professor.
He was working on

13:23.403 --> 13:25.103
a straight hourly
apprentice rate.

13:25.171 --> 13:27.405
I don't think
that's fair.
Do you, Mary Ann?

13:27.474 --> 13:30.808
I certainly do not.
Couldn't we go
to Mrs. howell?

13:30.877 --> 13:32.977
That wouldn't do
any good either,
Mary Ann.

13:33.045 --> 13:34.111
She's working
by the hour, too.

13:34.180 --> 13:35.746
I hate to say
this, skipper,

13:35.815 --> 13:37.815
but last night
when I was looking
down the mine

13:37.884 --> 13:39.684
at all that gold,

13:39.752 --> 13:41.219
something happened
to me.

13:41.287 --> 13:43.855
Well, ginger,
if you can admit it,
so can I.

13:43.923 --> 13:45.389
I've got gold fever.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.957
Professor?

13:47.026 --> 13:49.093
Why not?
Schoolteachers are human.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.095
It's amazing.
We've all been bitten

13:51.164 --> 13:52.997
by the same bug
at the same time.

13:53.065 --> 13:54.598
Gee. I hope it
isn't catching.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.300
I'd hate to see
poor gilligan
come down with it.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.136
It's a cinch
he'll catch it
sooner or later.

13:58.204 --> 13:59.570
Don't say that,
skipper.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.506
Don't say what?
What have I got?
What have I got?

14:01.575 --> 14:03.074
Calm down,
gilligan.

14:03.143 --> 14:05.242
Skipper, you gotta
tell me the truth.
What have I got?

14:05.311 --> 14:06.877
I know there's
no doctor or hospital
on this island.

14:06.946 --> 14:08.746
I wanna know the truth.
What have I got?

14:08.815 --> 14:12.249
All I said is that
you will probably get
what we've already got.

14:12.318 --> 14:15.820
Oh, no! Oh, no, no!
What's everybody got?

14:15.888 --> 14:17.254
Gold fever,
gilligan.

14:17.323 --> 14:18.989
That's what Mr. howell
said would happen.

14:19.058 --> 14:20.757
Oh, never mind
all that now.

14:20.826 --> 14:22.827
I sent you over
to Mr. howell
with a final plea

14:22.896 --> 14:24.295
in hopes that
he might share
his gold with us.

14:24.363 --> 14:25.596
Right, skipper.
Like I told him,

14:25.665 --> 14:26.931
all for one
and one for all.

14:26.999 --> 14:28.299
And what was
his answer?

14:28.368 --> 14:30.668
He sent me back
with this letter.

14:30.737 --> 14:32.003
Well, read
the letter aloud.

14:32.071 --> 14:33.771
Everybody is concerned
with it, gilligan.

14:33.839 --> 14:35.072
You want me to read
the whole letter?

14:35.141 --> 14:36.607
The whole letter.
What is his answer?

14:36.676 --> 14:37.608
Ahem...

14:37.677 --> 14:40.077
"No."

14:40.146 --> 14:42.112
He certainly writes
a nice letter.

14:42.181 --> 14:44.181
I guess
it's hopeless.

14:44.250 --> 14:45.949
Turned me down.
Now he's turned
gilligan down.

14:46.018 --> 14:47.751
We've tried
every approach.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.554
Not every approach,
skipper.

14:50.857 --> 14:53.558
[Whistling]

15:01.534 --> 15:02.933
Hello, Mr. howell.

15:03.002 --> 15:05.036
Yes, yes, miss Grant.

15:05.104 --> 15:06.504
I was just
wondering--

15:06.572 --> 15:09.373
everyone's been wondering,
and the answer is no.

15:09.442 --> 15:10.241
No?

15:10.310 --> 15:11.942
That's right.
A 14-karat no.

15:12.011 --> 15:15.479
But, Mr. howell,
i just wanted to
tell you something.

15:15.548 --> 15:18.482
Mr. howell,
i don't think
the others

15:18.551 --> 15:20.851
have been
very fair to you
about your gold mine.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.653
You don't?

15:22.722 --> 15:24.455
No. I don't like
the way they've been
acting at all.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.557
Heavens to fort Knox,
neither do I.

15:26.626 --> 15:30.862
Mr. howell, I think
they've been making
you feel guilty

15:30.930 --> 15:32.529
about digging
your gold mine.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.800
I've been digging so fast,
i haven't had a chance
to feel guilty.

15:35.868 --> 15:37.835
I been--i--i--

15:37.904 --> 15:38.969
Mr. howell.
Yes?

15:39.038 --> 15:40.771
I think they're
very greedy,

15:40.840 --> 15:44.442
depriving you
of the right
to be generous

15:44.510 --> 15:47.311
and to be
the wonderful man
i know you are.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.446
What?

15:48.514 --> 15:50.448
Mr. howell,
i know you.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.316
I know
that deep down
in your soul,

15:52.385 --> 15:54.418
you're a wonderful,
generous man,

15:54.487 --> 15:57.355
and you wanted
to share your gold
with all of us.

15:57.423 --> 15:58.723
Yes, I did...

15:58.791 --> 16:02.226
But thank goodness
i fought off that
nasty impulse.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.996
The answer
is still...No!

16:06.699 --> 16:07.765
No?

16:07.834 --> 16:09.266
No doubt about it.

16:09.335 --> 16:10.668
The only way we're gonna
get any gold for ourselves

16:10.737 --> 16:12.236
is to stake out a claim
and start digging.

16:12.305 --> 16:15.006
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!

16:41.434 --> 16:42.967
Water, please.

16:43.035 --> 16:45.436
[Gasp] Did you have
to spill everything
all over the table?

16:45.505 --> 16:48.206
Do you have to yell
at the table?

16:48.708 --> 16:50.007
[Coughs]

16:50.076 --> 16:52.243
Do you have to sing
at the table?

16:52.312 --> 16:53.644
I wasn't singing.
I was coughing.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.680
Well, do you
have to cough
at the table?

16:55.749 --> 16:57.382
No gold for you
either, huh?

16:57.450 --> 16:58.583
Not a nugget.

16:59.886 --> 17:01.018
Hi...

17:01.086 --> 17:04.021
[All griping at once]

17:09.228 --> 17:10.394
Anyone wanna work
on the raft tonight?

17:10.463 --> 17:12.061
Absolutely!
Good idea,
skipper!

17:12.131 --> 17:13.531
I'm sorry we're
late, folks,

17:13.598 --> 17:15.433
but we just struck
a rich vein,

17:15.501 --> 17:18.301
and lovey was afraid
it might bleed
all over the floor.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.404
Mrs. howell:
Thurston can't stand
a messy mine.

17:20.473 --> 17:22.973
He always says
a mine that's lumpy
makes you grumpy.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.809
An ode to the mother lode!

17:27.814 --> 17:29.012
Well, don't let
your bad luck

17:29.081 --> 17:30.548
ruin our good dinner,
right, lovey?

17:30.616 --> 17:32.850
Right, darling.
You've no idea

17:32.919 --> 17:36.320
how filling 50 bags
with gold gives you
an appetite.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.554
Come on,
let's go down

17:37.623 --> 17:38.956
and take a look
at the raft, huh?

17:39.025 --> 17:41.692
Yes. I'm not
very hungry anyway.

17:41.760 --> 17:45.362
Say, uh, captain...
How's it coming?
Any progress?

17:45.431 --> 17:47.098
Not since I've been
in the mining business.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.666
I'm gonna turn in
my pick and shovel

17:48.735 --> 17:50.234
and start working
on that raft
in the morning.

17:50.303 --> 17:52.035
As long as
you're turning in
your mining tools,

17:52.104 --> 17:54.838
perhaps Mrs. howell
and I could use them.

17:54.907 --> 17:58.008
When I say "use,"
of course I mean
on a rental basis.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.711
Say, if i
rent 'em to you,
maybe I can do--

18:00.780 --> 18:03.381
that'd work out
just fine.
Ha ha ha!

18:05.918 --> 18:07.552
Anybody home?

18:07.620 --> 18:08.552
Who's calling?

18:08.620 --> 18:10.821
Gilligan's rent-a-pick
calling.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.689
Yes, yes, gentlemen.
Come in.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.091
Door-to-cave
service.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.660
Boy, have we got
some bargains for you.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.329
I just love bargains.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.699
Gentlemen, this is
an unexpected pleasure,
i must say.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.569
All part of
our service,
Mr. howell.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.470
Oh, lovey, come
see what daddy has
bought for you.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.172
We have
6 pieces here.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.273
If you buy all 6,
we'll give you a
very special price.

18:30.342 --> 18:31.709
We hate to
break up a set.

18:31.777 --> 18:34.311
Good morning, gilligan.
How are you, skipper?

18:34.380 --> 18:36.914
Oh, thurston howell III,

18:36.982 --> 18:40.350
are all these
beautiful things
for me?

18:40.419 --> 18:42.386
Nothing finer for
the dainty miner.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.021
Oh, darling, you're
so extravagant.

18:44.090 --> 18:45.856
Yes, my dear.
I'll see you later
at the papaya club.

18:45.924 --> 18:48.358
I can't wait to use them.
Thank you, darling.

18:48.427 --> 18:50.193
Now, gentlemen,
what is the name
of your company?

18:50.262 --> 18:51.962
Oh, no checks,
please, Mr. howell.

18:52.031 --> 18:53.564
No checks?!

18:53.632 --> 18:54.331
No banks.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.599
Money will do
just fine.

18:55.668 --> 18:58.201
I haven't used money
in the past 25 years.

18:58.270 --> 19:00.872
Might I suggest
one of these bags?

19:00.940 --> 19:03.273
One of those bags
is worth $200!

19:03.342 --> 19:05.042
Well, might I suggest
2 of these bags?

19:05.111 --> 19:06.711
But--

19:06.779 --> 19:10.480
...so the elephant said,
"let go of my trunk."

19:10.549 --> 19:12.783
Oh, ginger,
my compliments
to the chef.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.985
That was a superb
seafood salad.
Thank you.

19:15.054 --> 19:16.787
I hope the lobster wasn't
too rich for you.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.490
If he was, he
didn't get a chance
to mention it.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.626
Thurston, you know,
i think it's rude

19:22.695 --> 19:26.496
to talk about money
at the table in front
of a strange lobster.

19:26.565 --> 19:27.731
Will that be
all, sir?

19:27.800 --> 19:29.466
Yes, that'll be all.
Here you are, sir.

19:29.535 --> 19:31.402
What is this?
That's the
dinner check.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.238
$740?!

19:34.307 --> 19:37.240
Seafood salad--$175?!

19:37.309 --> 19:39.042
Lobster--200?!

19:39.111 --> 19:40.611
Grapefruit
muffins--125,

19:40.680 --> 19:43.280
side order
of guava jelly--
50, uh...

19:43.349 --> 19:44.481
So that's your
little game, huh?

19:44.550 --> 19:46.483
First the skipper,
then gilligan.

19:46.552 --> 19:49.186
You're gonna charge
us for our meals,
huh? Well!

19:49.255 --> 19:51.122
That's a fine
kettle of fish.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.690
Thanks for reminding
me, Mrs. howell.

19:52.759 --> 19:53.557
For what?

19:53.625 --> 19:55.693
One kettle
of fish--$300.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.396
And that is positively
my last offer.

19:59.465 --> 20:01.365
Well, if $600 is
all you can spend,

20:01.434 --> 20:02.966
take only 3 candles.
What?

20:03.035 --> 20:05.102
You can't beat
that price anyplace
on the island.

20:05.171 --> 20:08.406
Please, thurston.
You can't see a thing
down in that mine.

20:08.474 --> 20:10.207
Alright, I'll
take 6 candles.

20:10.276 --> 20:11.875
Give the man
$1,200.

20:11.944 --> 20:14.478
$50 more, and i
could gift-wrap
these for you.

20:14.547 --> 20:17.147
No. $1,200 for
6 of them, that's
my last offer.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.282
Well, you're
the man with
the gold mine.

20:19.351 --> 20:21.452
Oh, by the way,
as long as
you're here,

20:21.521 --> 20:23.086
would you
like to look
at some wicks?

20:23.155 --> 20:25.288
You mean there
aren't any wicks
in these candles?

20:25.357 --> 20:27.792
Not for this
kind of money.

20:35.634 --> 20:37.701
That raft is in
perfect shape.

20:37.770 --> 20:40.103
We can float for days
until we're spotted
by a ship or a plane.

20:40.172 --> 20:43.640
I hope that provisions
have been made for my bag
of gold aboard your raft.

20:43.709 --> 20:47.377
Nothing doing. The professor
knows exactly how much weight
that raft will support.

20:47.446 --> 20:50.013
Right. With our combined
weight and the weight
of the provisions,

20:50.082 --> 20:52.483
we can't take a chance.
Gold is very heavy.

20:52.551 --> 20:54.618
Well, my bag
isn't heavy.

20:54.687 --> 20:57.020
Mine's as light
as a feath--

20:57.089 --> 20:59.657
can't I take
a teensy-weensy
little bag of gold?

20:59.725 --> 21:01.392
How teensy-weensy
a bag?

21:01.460 --> 21:03.560
This teensy-weensy?

21:03.629 --> 21:05.029
No!

21:05.097 --> 21:06.396
[Thud]
Ohh!

21:06.465 --> 21:07.798
There will be no gold
aboard the raft,

21:07.867 --> 21:09.300
and that goes for
you, too, gilligan.

21:09.368 --> 21:10.534
I don't have
any gold.

21:10.603 --> 21:13.036
You had $3,000 worth
last night.

21:13.105 --> 21:16.274
I know. I never
should've ordered
that coconut cream pie.

21:17.409 --> 21:20.544
Alright, everybody,
get on board.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.313
I wanna take these
golf sticks back

21:22.381 --> 21:23.514
to show
to the boys
at the club.

21:23.582 --> 21:24.514
Million laughs.

21:24.583 --> 21:25.649
Mr. howell.
Mrs. howell.

21:25.718 --> 21:26.950
Oh, captain,
that's alright.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.520
I made this handbag
while I was here.

21:29.589 --> 21:31.188
I want
to take it home
to show everyone.

21:31.257 --> 21:32.589
Why, certainly.
Watch your step now.

21:32.658 --> 21:34.558
Watch it there,
dear.

21:34.627 --> 21:35.926
This is my homemade
guava jelly.

21:35.995 --> 21:37.494
Can't have too much
of this around.

21:37.563 --> 21:40.097
Ha ha! That's
right, Mary Ann.
Watch your step.

21:40.166 --> 21:43.667
I've got a complete
diary of every day
we've spent here.

21:43.736 --> 21:44.902
Should make
a great movie, huh?

21:44.971 --> 21:47.704
I should say so.

21:47.773 --> 21:49.306
These botanical
specimens

21:49.375 --> 21:52.209
should be of
special interest
back at the school.

21:52.277 --> 21:55.512
Don't fall over
that, professor.

21:55.581 --> 21:57.915
Alright, gilligan...
Cast off.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.616
I sure hope this floats.
You know how deep
the lagoon is.

21:59.685 --> 22:01.686
I know how deep
the lagoon is.

22:01.754 --> 22:04.055
Now cast off.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.826
Everybody get an oar!
Here we go, folks...

22:09.895 --> 22:11.829
Headed for the shipping lanes
and rescue!

22:11.898 --> 22:14.798
Yeah, au revoir!
Good-bye, island!

22:14.867 --> 22:16.266
Bye!

22:16.335 --> 22:17.968
Yeah, good-bye.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.503
Stroke! Stroke!

22:19.572 --> 22:21.771
Row, Mrs. howell!

22:21.840 --> 22:23.074
Gilligan,
hold your course--

22:23.142 --> 22:23.874
we're sinking.

22:23.943 --> 22:25.342
Preposterous!

22:25.411 --> 22:28.479
We couldn't have
2 disasters under
the same captain.

22:28.547 --> 22:31.015
Skipper,
what will we do?

22:31.083 --> 22:32.349
Aah!
It's alright.

22:32.418 --> 22:34.752
What'll we do?

22:34.820 --> 22:37.287
Abandon--
abandon ship!

22:37.356 --> 22:38.823
Women and luggage first!

22:38.891 --> 22:40.023
Oh! My hat!
Oh!

22:40.092 --> 22:42.760
We're drowning!
Oh! I can't swim!

22:42.828 --> 22:46.329
Women and luggage first!
Women and luggage first!

22:46.398 --> 22:48.165
Aah! Lovey!

22:48.233 --> 22:51.768
Skipper, are you or
aren't you gonna go
down with the ship?

22:51.837 --> 22:56.874
I hope not, but if I go,
you'll go with me!

23:01.514 --> 23:05.148
Thurston: Gilligan!
Get my golf clubs!

23:05.217 --> 23:07.817
There! Get my golf clubs!

23:07.886 --> 23:09.386
Lovey! Where are you,
my darling?

23:09.455 --> 23:11.655
Hang on!

23:31.677 --> 23:33.510
We sank anyway,
even without the gold.

23:33.578 --> 23:36.013
I'm afraid this is
all my fault, folks.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.882
I didn't think one bag
of gold would sink us.

23:38.951 --> 23:40.684
2 bags.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.185
3 bags.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.187
4 bags.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.489
5 bags.

23:45.558 --> 23:46.857
6 bags?

23:48.427 --> 23:49.860
Huh, that's
a switch.

23:49.929 --> 23:53.030
Usually,
I'm the one left
holding the bag.

24:04.744 --> 24:06.810
Well, I guess we've all
learned a bitter lesson.

24:06.879 --> 24:08.645
You're so right,
professor.

24:08.714 --> 24:09.846
We've lost all our gold,

24:09.915 --> 24:11.314
and we've ruined
our life raft,

24:11.383 --> 24:13.117
all because
we were so greedy.

24:13.186 --> 24:15.085
I'll never be
greedy again.

24:15.153 --> 24:16.286
Neither will I.

24:16.355 --> 24:19.189
Neither will I.
Thurston?

24:19.258 --> 24:22.126
You people
are always taking
the fun out of life.

24:23.162 --> 24:26.396
Ooh! Mm...Mm...

24:26.465 --> 24:27.698
Look what I found
in this oyster.

24:27.766 --> 24:30.600
Ginger:
It's a Pearl!

24:30.669 --> 24:32.669
Why, it's a perfect Pearl!

24:32.738 --> 24:35.472
Uh, where'd you
find that oyster?

24:35.541 --> 24:36.740
Over in the cove.
There's hundreds
of them.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.776
Hundreds of them!

24:40.613 --> 24:43.080
Or maybe thousands of them!

24:43.149 --> 24:48.118
Or maybe only
1, 2, 3, 4...
All for me.

25:03.268 --> 25:05.201
¶ They're here for
a long, long time ¶

25:05.270 --> 25:07.704
¶ they'll have to make
the best of things ¶

25:07.773 --> 25:09.373
¶ it's an uphill climb ¶

25:09.441 --> 25:11.875
¶ the first mate
and his skipper, too ¶

25:11.944 --> 25:13.878
¶ will do their very best ¶

25:13.946 --> 25:16.046
¶ to make the others
comfortable ¶

25:16.115 --> 25:18.215
¶ in their tropic island nest ¶

25:18.284 --> 25:20.550
¶ no phone, no lights,
no motorcar ¶

25:20.619 --> 25:22.752
¶ not a single luxury ¶

25:22.821 --> 25:24.921
¶ like Robinson crusoe ¶

25:24.990 --> 25:26.923
¶ it's primitive
as can be ¶

25:26.992 --> 25:29.593
¶ so join us here each week,
my friends ¶

25:29.662 --> 25:31.428
¶ you're sure
to get a smile ¶

25:31.497 --> 25:33.730
¶ for 7 stranded castaways ¶

25:33.799 --> 25:35.766
¶ here on gilligan's isle ¶
