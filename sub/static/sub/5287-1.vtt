02:37.654 --> 02:39.451
All right, Curly, enough's enough.

02:39.556 --> 02:44.186
You can't eat the Venetian blinds.
I just had them installed on Wednesday.

03:00.444 --> 03:02.036
Down the hatch.

03:14.291 --> 03:17.192
- She's no good.
- What can I tell you, kid? You're right.

03:17.294 --> 03:18.921
When you're right, you're right.

03:19.062 --> 03:20.723
And you're right.

03:21.899 --> 03:23.833
I'll pay you the rest next week.

03:23.934 --> 03:26.767
We only caught 60 tonne of skipjack
down in San Benedict.

03:26.904 --> 03:30.067
And they don't pay you the same
for skipjack as they do albacore or tuna.

03:30.207 --> 03:31.401
Forget it, will you, Curly?

03:31.542 --> 03:34.841
I only brought it up to illustrate a point.
I don't want your last dime.

03:34.945 --> 03:37.175
What kind of a guy do you think I am?

03:37.281 --> 03:39.681
- Thank you, Mr. Gittes.
- Call me Jake.

03:39.783 --> 03:42.217
Careful driving home, Curl, huh?

03:42.986 --> 03:46.945
Mrs. Mulwray's waiting for you
with Mr. Walsh and Mr. Duffy.

03:47.958 --> 03:50.756
Mrs. Mulwray, may I present Mr. Gittes?

03:51.495 --> 03:54.726
- Mrs. Mulwray, how do you do?
- Mr. Gittes.

03:55.299 --> 03:58.268
Now, what seems to be the problem?

03:59.102 --> 04:00.569
My husband,

04:01.338 --> 04:03.306
I believe, is seeing another woman.

04:05.475 --> 04:08.273
- No. Really?
- I'm afraid so.

04:08.846 --> 04:10.040
I am sorry.

04:10.147 --> 04:14.106
Mr. Gittes, please, do you think
we could discuss this alone?

04:16.420 --> 04:19.321
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Mulwray.
These are my operatives,

04:19.456 --> 04:22.721
and at some point,
they're going to have to assist me.

04:22.826 --> 04:25.226
I can't do everything myself.

04:25.329 --> 04:26.660
Of course not.

04:26.797 --> 04:28.094
Now,

04:32.002 --> 04:34.937
what makes you certain
that your husband is

04:36.340 --> 04:37.637
involved with someone?

04:37.774 --> 04:39.435
A wife can tell.

04:40.878 --> 04:44.109
Mrs. Mulwray,
do you love your husband?

04:45.315 --> 04:46.441
Yes, of course!

04:46.550 --> 04:48.950
- Then go home and forget everything.
- But, l...

04:49.052 --> 04:51.179
I'm sure that he loves you, too,
Mrs. Mulwray.

04:51.321 --> 04:55.189
Do you know the expression,
"Let sleeping dogs lie"?

04:56.360 --> 04:58.760
You're better off not knowing.

04:58.862 --> 05:00.489
I have to know.

05:05.369 --> 05:06.768
Very well.

05:08.038 --> 05:10.632
What is your husband's first name?

05:10.741 --> 05:11.867
Hollis.

05:12.009 --> 05:13.601
Hollis Mulwray.

05:14.711 --> 05:17.771
- Water and Power?
- He's Chief Engineer.

05:19.216 --> 05:21.013
Chief Engineer?

05:28.225 --> 05:30.216
Mrs. Mulwray, this...

05:30.360 --> 05:34.763
This type of investigation can be hard
on your pocketbook.

05:35.399 --> 05:37.026
It takes time...

05:37.167 --> 05:39.931
Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.

05:43.507 --> 05:45.338
Okay, we'll...

05:46.310 --> 05:48.369
We'll see what we can do.

05:48.946 --> 05:51.039
Gentlemen, today
you can walk out that door,

05:51.181 --> 05:54.207
turn right, hop a streetcar,
and within 25 minutes,

05:54.351 --> 05:56.842
end up smack in the Pacific Ocean.

05:56.987 --> 06:00.650
Now, you can swim in it and you can
fish in it, but you can't drink it,

06:00.757 --> 06:04.022
and you can't irrigate
an orange grove with it.

06:04.161 --> 06:06.686
Now remember,
we live next door to the ocean,

06:06.997 --> 06:09.864
but we also live on the edge of a desert.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.628
Los Angeles is a desert community.

06:12.736 --> 06:16.297
Beneath this building,
beneath our streets, is a desert.

06:16.573 --> 06:19.406
And without water,
the dust will rise up and cover us

06:19.509 --> 06:20.908
as though we never existed.

06:21.044 --> 06:24.207
Now, the Alto Vallejo
can save us from this,

06:24.348 --> 06:28.182
and I respectfully suggest
that $8.5 million

06:28.285 --> 06:32.244
is a fair price to pay
to keep the desert from our streets

06:32.389 --> 06:33.378
and not on top of them.

06:33.623 --> 06:34.647
Hear, hear!

06:39.563 --> 06:43.226
Mayor Bagby, let's hear
from all the departments again.

06:43.367 --> 06:46.564
I suppose we'd better take
Water and Power first.

06:46.703 --> 06:47.897
Mr. Mulwray?

06:59.449 --> 07:01.383
In case you've forgotten, gentlemen,

07:01.485 --> 07:05.114
over 500 lives were lost
when the Van der Lip Dam gave way.

07:07.324 --> 07:10.225
Core samples have shown
that beneath this bedrock

07:10.327 --> 07:14.923
is shale similar to the permeable shale
in the Van der Lip disaster.

07:15.065 --> 07:18.034
It couldn't withstand
that kind of pressure.

07:18.135 --> 07:21.730
And now you propose
yet another dirt-banked terminus dam

07:21.838 --> 07:25.035
with slopes of 2.5:1, 112 feet high,

07:25.142 --> 07:27.610
and a 12,000-acre water surface.

07:28.612 --> 07:30.102
Well, it won't hold.

07:30.747 --> 07:33.307
I won't build it. It's that simple.

07:33.450 --> 07:36.214
I'm not going to make
the same mistake twice.

07:36.319 --> 07:38.150
Thank you, gentlemen.

07:43.994 --> 07:46.292
Quiet! Quiet!

07:48.865 --> 07:52.733
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Get those goddamn things out of here!

07:52.836 --> 07:55.168
- Hold some of them.
- Tell me where to take them!

07:55.305 --> 07:58.832
You don't have an answer for that
so quick, do you?

07:58.975 --> 08:02.570
You steal water from the Valley,
ruin the grazing,

08:03.547 --> 08:05.447
starve the livestock!

08:05.549 --> 08:07.915
Who's paying you to do that,
Mr. Mulwray?

08:08.018 --> 08:09.679
That's what I want to know!

12:56.339 --> 12:59.399
- Jeez, he was there all night.
- That's right.

13:00.410 --> 13:03.868
I had to go back three times
to pick up the watches.

13:09.753 --> 13:11.550
Yesterday he went to three reservoirs,

13:11.688 --> 13:15.215
a men's room at a Richfield gas station,
and The Pig'n Whistle.

13:15.392 --> 13:17.883
The guy's got water on the brain.

13:29.773 --> 13:31.866
So what do you got?

13:53.997 --> 13:55.055
This?

13:55.165 --> 13:59.363
Well, they got into a terrific argument
outside The Pig'n Whistle.

14:01.404 --> 14:02.428
What about?

14:02.572 --> 14:04.972
I don't know. The traffic was pretty loud.

14:05.108 --> 14:06.939
I heard only one thing, though.

14:07.076 --> 14:08.304
"Apple core."

14:09.112 --> 14:11.410
- "Apple core"?
- Yeah.

14:14.617 --> 14:17.643
My God, Walsh, is that
what you spent your day doing?

14:17.787 --> 14:21.154
Look, you tell me to take pictures,
I take pictures.

14:21.291 --> 14:23.885
Let me explain
something to you, Walsh.

14:23.993 --> 14:25.392
J. J. Gittes and Associates.

14:25.495 --> 14:28.896
This business requires
a certain amount of finesse.

14:32.001 --> 14:33.127
What is it, Sophie?

14:33.269 --> 14:35.134
Duffy's on the phone.

14:39.876 --> 14:41.503
- Yeah, Duff, where are you?
- I got it!

14:41.644 --> 14:44.306
He's found himself
some cute little twist, the old buzzard...

14:44.447 --> 14:45.937
Okay. Slow down. Where are you?

14:46.049 --> 14:47.744
I'm at Glendale and Douglas.

14:47.851 --> 14:50.684
They're in Echo Park in a rowboat.
A rowboat!

14:50.820 --> 14:52.117
Okay.

14:54.858 --> 14:56.450
Echo Park.

14:56.559 --> 14:57.651
Water again.

15:11.040 --> 15:14.271
Okay, pal, let's have us a big smile.

15:21.851 --> 15:23.443
You'll love it.

16:13.803 --> 16:15.771
Here. Let me...

16:28.117 --> 16:31.245
When you get so much publicity,
you got to get blase about it.

16:31.387 --> 16:34.879
Let's face it, Jake,
you're practically a movie star.

16:39.729 --> 16:42.789
- Just look at that, Barn.
- Yeah, the heat's murder.

16:42.932 --> 16:44.263
Sure is.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.732
Fools' names and fools' faces.

16:50.673 --> 16:52.868
- What's that, pal?
- Nothing.

16:53.910 --> 16:55.571
You got a hell of a way to make a living.

16:55.678 --> 16:58.943
Oh? And what do you do
to make ends meet?

16:59.082 --> 17:01.949
Mortgage department,
First National Bank.

17:02.652 --> 17:06.213
T ell me, did you foreclose
on many families this week?

17:06.321 --> 17:08.722
We don't publish a record in the paper,
I can tell you that.

17:08.825 --> 17:10.291
Neither do l.

17:10.425 --> 17:12.894
No, you have your press agent do it.

17:12.996 --> 17:16.261
Who is this bimbo, Barney?
Is he a regular customer or what?

17:16.366 --> 17:18.060
Hey, listen, pal, I make an honest living.

17:18.166 --> 17:20.135
People only come to me
when they're in a desperate situation.

17:20.269 --> 17:22.464
I help them out.
I don't kick families out of their houses

17:22.605 --> 17:25.506
- like you bums down at the bank do!
- Jake, can I tell you about the guy who...

17:25.642 --> 17:27.439
Maybe you'd like to step down
out of the barber chair

17:27.542 --> 17:29.010
and maybe we can go outside
and discuss it.

17:29.145 --> 17:30.134
- What do you think?
- Oh, come on.

17:30.279 --> 17:31.610
Jake, let me tell you about the guy
who got tired...

17:31.714 --> 17:33.739
I don't know how that thing
got in the newspaper.

17:33.850 --> 17:35.977
It was so quick,
I didn't even know it myself.

17:36.119 --> 17:38.178
- Thank you.
- I make an honest living!

17:38.321 --> 17:39.754
Of course you do.

17:39.856 --> 17:42.154
Anyway, this guy
who got tired of screwing his wife

17:42.291 --> 17:44.657
- said to his friend, "What do I do?"
- An honest living, you understand?

17:44.794 --> 17:46.659
So the guy says, "Why don't you do
what the Chinese do?"

17:46.796 --> 17:48.354
He says, "What do the Chinese do?"

17:48.498 --> 17:50.591
He says, "The Chinese they screw
a little and they get tired..."

17:52.201 --> 17:54.101
Duffy. Hey, Walsh!

17:54.203 --> 17:57.832
Sophie, go to the little girls' room
for a minute, okay?

17:58.174 --> 18:00.642
- But, Mr. Gittes...
- Sophie...

18:01.844 --> 18:03.311
Yes, Mr. Gittes.

18:03.413 --> 18:04.471
- Jake...
- Duffy, listen to me, man.

18:04.580 --> 18:05.842
I want to tell you a story.

18:05.982 --> 18:08.041
So, there's this guy, Walsh,
you understand?

18:08.184 --> 18:09.947
He's tired of screwing his wife.

18:10.053 --> 18:11.611
- Jake, there's a problem...
- Wait a second, Duffy.

18:11.721 --> 18:13.279
You're always in such a hurry.

18:13.389 --> 18:15.016
So his friend says to him,

18:15.158 --> 18:17.285
"Hey, why don't you
do it like the Chinese do?"

18:17.393 --> 18:19.327
So he says,
"Well, how do the Chinese do it?"

18:19.429 --> 18:22.057
The guy says, "Well, the Chinese,
first they screw a little bit,

18:22.198 --> 18:24.826
"then they stop and they go
and read a little Confucius.

18:24.934 --> 18:27.801
"Come back, screw a little bit more,
then they stop again,

18:27.904 --> 18:29.735
- "go back and they screw a little..."
- Jake.

18:29.872 --> 18:32.170
Walsh, just listen to me for a second.

18:32.275 --> 18:33.708
I mean, you'll love this.

18:33.843 --> 18:36.971
Now, then they go back
and they screw a little bit more,

18:37.080 --> 18:39.014
and then they go out
and they contemplate the moon

18:39.115 --> 18:42.050
or something like that.
Makes it more exciting.

18:42.185 --> 18:46.053
So, now, the guy goes home and
he starts screwing his own wife, see.

18:46.522 --> 18:48.422
So, he screws her for a little bit,
and then he stops.

18:48.558 --> 18:51.254
He goes out of the room
and reads LIFE magazine.

18:51.394 --> 18:53.419
Then he goes back in,
he starts screwing again,

18:53.563 --> 18:55.030
and he says,
"Excuse me for a minute, honey"

18:55.131 --> 18:56.826
and he goes out
and he smokes a cigarette.

18:56.933 --> 18:59.265
Now, his wife is getting sore as hell.

18:59.402 --> 19:01.336
He comes back in the room,
he starts screwing again,

19:01.437 --> 19:03.405
he gets up to start to leave again
to go look at the moon,

19:03.539 --> 19:05.336
she looks at him and says,
"Hey, what's the matter with you?

19:05.441 --> 19:08.239
"You're screwing just like a Chinaman!"

19:09.979 --> 19:11.173
Jesus!

19:11.547 --> 19:13.014
That Barney!

19:18.421 --> 19:19.718
Mr. Gittes?

19:21.591 --> 19:22.717
Yes.

19:23.493 --> 19:25.085
Do you know me?

19:26.329 --> 19:27.353
Well,

19:28.898 --> 19:31.230
I think I would have remembered.

19:31.334 --> 19:33.268
Have we ever met?

19:35.738 --> 19:37.205
Well, no.

19:37.306 --> 19:38.603
Never?

19:38.741 --> 19:39.935
Never.

19:40.276 --> 19:41.766
That's what I thought.

19:41.911 --> 19:43.936
You see, I'm Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.

19:44.080 --> 19:46.378
You know, Mr. Mulwray's wife?

19:47.850 --> 19:51.081
Not that Mulwray?

19:51.187 --> 19:53.781
Yes, Mr. Gittes, that Mulwray.

19:55.358 --> 19:58.156
And since you agree with me
that we've never met before,

19:58.294 --> 20:01.559
you must also agree with me
that I never hired you to do anything,

20:01.664 --> 20:04.098
certainly not spy on my husband.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.930
I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes.

20:08.137 --> 20:10.401
Well, you're going to get it.

20:11.207 --> 20:12.606
Now, wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray.

20:12.708 --> 20:14.767
I think there's been some
misunderstanding here.

20:14.877 --> 20:16.469
There's no point
in getting tough with me. I'm just...

20:16.612 --> 20:19.604
I don't get tough with anyone, Mr. Gittes.

20:19.715 --> 20:21.342
My lawyer does.

20:22.885 --> 20:25.615
Here's something for you, Mr. Gittes.

20:29.025 --> 20:32.153
I suppose we'll be hearing
from your attorney.

20:47.643 --> 20:49.941
- Mr. Mulwray?
- He's not in, Mr...

20:50.046 --> 20:52.708
- Gittes.
- May I ask what this is regarding?

20:52.849 --> 20:55.147
It's a personal matter.
Has he been gone long?

20:55.251 --> 20:56.718
Since lunch.

20:57.186 --> 21:00.383
- Gee whiz, and I'm late.
- He was expecting you?

21:00.523 --> 21:04.015
Fifteen minutes ago.
Why don't I just go in and wait?

21:05.228 --> 21:06.490
Sir?

21:10.199 --> 21:12.258
Is Mr. Yelburton there?

21:13.135 --> 21:15.399
Is he still in the building?

21:16.138 --> 21:18.003
Very well. Thank you.

22:40.022 --> 22:43.753
Can I help you? Russ Yelburton,
Deputy Chief of the department.

22:43.859 --> 22:45.349
J. J. Gittes.

22:45.494 --> 22:48.088
It's not a departmental matter,
Mr. Yelburton.

22:48.197 --> 22:50.427
I wonder if you'd care
to wait in my office.

22:50.533 --> 22:51.625
Certainly.

22:52.535 --> 22:54.799
We're a bit nervous around here

22:54.904 --> 22:57.805
with all this business in the papers
about Mr. Mulwray.

22:57.907 --> 22:59.602
Right this way.

23:05.348 --> 23:09.842
You know, after you've worked
with a man for a certain length of time,

23:09.986 --> 23:12.511
you come to know his habits, his values.

23:12.655 --> 23:13.679
You come to know him.

23:13.823 --> 23:16.986
And either he's the kind
who chases after women or he isn't.

23:17.093 --> 23:18.458
And Mulwray isn't?

23:18.561 --> 23:20.825
He never even kids about it.

23:21.230 --> 23:23.994
Well, maybe he takes it very seriously.

23:26.535 --> 23:29.129
- Sit down.
- No, thank you.

23:29.238 --> 23:31.399
Do you know
where Mulwray's having lunch?

23:31.540 --> 23:33.531
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

23:34.243 --> 23:36.507
Well, tell him I'll be back.

23:37.580 --> 23:38.842
I will.

23:39.749 --> 23:41.182
Do you mind if I take one of your cards?

23:41.283 --> 23:43.148
In case I have
to get in touch with you again.

23:43.252 --> 23:45.584
- No, help yourself.
- Thank you.

23:50.092 --> 23:52.424
Mulvihill! What are you doing here?

23:52.561 --> 23:54.859
They shut my water off.
What's it to you?

23:54.964 --> 23:58.229
How'd you find out about it?
You don't drink it.

23:58.367 --> 24:00.858
You don't take a bath in it.

24:00.970 --> 24:02.665
They wrote you a letter!

24:02.805 --> 24:05.706
But then you'd have to be able to read.

24:07.376 --> 24:11.107
Relax, Mulvihill. Glad to see you.
You know Claude Mulvihill here?

24:11.247 --> 24:13.841
Well, I hope so. He's working for us.

24:13.949 --> 24:15.041
Doing what?

24:15.151 --> 24:16.618
Well, frankly, there have been
some threats

24:16.752 --> 24:18.515
to blow up the city reservoirs.

24:18.621 --> 24:21.181
- Any particular reason?
- Well, it's this darn drought.

24:21.290 --> 24:23.918
We've had to ration water in the Valley
and the farmers are desperate.

24:24.060 --> 24:26.528
But what can we do? The rest of the city
needs drinking water.

24:26.629 --> 24:29.257
- Well, you're in luck, Mr. Yelburton.
- How's that?

24:29.398 --> 24:31.923
When Mulvihill here
was Sheriff of Ventura County,

24:32.068 --> 24:35.401
the rum runners landed hundreds
of tonnes of booze on the beach

24:35.504 --> 24:37.972
and never lost a drop.

24:38.107 --> 24:41.406
He ought to be able
to hold on to your water for you.

25:41.504 --> 25:43.995
J. J. Gittes to see Mr. Mulwray.

26:07.897 --> 26:09.194
Please.

26:25.114 --> 26:26.411
You wait.

27:27.977 --> 27:31.140
- Bad for glass.
- Yeah. Sure.

27:32.281 --> 27:34.442
Bad for the glass.

28:11.120 --> 28:12.144
Mr. Gittes.

28:12.288 --> 28:15.746
Actually, I came to see
your husband, Mrs. Mulwray.

28:18.394 --> 28:20.157
Would you like something to drink?

28:20.296 --> 28:21.456
What are you having?

28:21.563 --> 28:24.327
- lced tea.
- That'll be fine, thank you.

28:24.466 --> 28:27.629
- Two iced teas, Kahn, please?
- Yes, ma'am.

28:28.804 --> 28:30.931
My husband's at the office.

28:32.174 --> 28:34.836
Actually, he's not, Mrs. Mulwray,

28:34.977 --> 28:37.468
and he's checked out of his apartment
at the El Macondo.

28:37.579 --> 28:40.377
That's not his apartment.

28:41.917 --> 28:43.282
Anyway, l...

28:44.820 --> 28:48.051
The point is, is I'm not in business
to be loved, but I am in business,

28:48.190 --> 28:50.556
and believe me, Mrs. Mulwray,
whoever set your husband up,

28:50.693 --> 28:51.785
set me up.

28:51.894 --> 28:54.124
L. A.'s a small town. People talk.

28:54.229 --> 28:57.687
I'm just trying to make a living.
I don't want to become a local joke.

28:57.833 --> 29:01.291
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it.
I'll drop the lawsuit.

29:01.403 --> 29:03.530
- What?
- I said, I'll drop the lawsuit.

29:03.672 --> 29:05.731
So let's just drop the whole thing.

29:05.874 --> 29:07.569
- Sugar, lemon, or both?
- Both.

29:07.710 --> 29:09.507
- Mrs. Mulwray...
- Yes, Mr. Gittes?

29:09.611 --> 29:11.738
...I don't want to drop it.

29:13.215 --> 29:16.082
I better talk to your husband about this.

29:16.218 --> 29:18.686
Why? What on Earth for?

29:18.787 --> 29:20.880
Hollis seems to think
you're an innocent man.

29:22.224 --> 29:24.715
Well, I've been accused
of a lot of things before, Mrs. Mulwray,

29:24.860 --> 29:25.918
but never that.

29:26.061 --> 29:27.995
Look, somebody's gone
to a lot of trouble here,

29:28.097 --> 29:30.395
and lawsuit or no lawsuit,
I intend to find out.

29:30.532 --> 29:33.763
I'm not supposed to be the one
who's caught with his pants down.

29:33.902 --> 29:36.336
So unless it's a problem,
I'd like to talk to your husband.

29:36.438 --> 29:38.372
Why should it be a problem?

29:38.474 --> 29:42.706
- May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
- You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.

29:43.912 --> 29:46.073
Well, that little girlfriend,
she was pretty,

29:46.181 --> 29:48.445
in a cheap sort of a way, of course.

29:48.584 --> 29:51.883
She's disappeared.
Maybe they disappeared together.

29:51.987 --> 29:54.922
Suppose they did.
How does that affect you?

29:55.457 --> 29:58.153
- It's nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray.
- It's very personal!

29:58.293 --> 30:00.591
It couldn't be more personal.

30:01.497 --> 30:04.295
Is this business
or an obsession with you?

30:04.433 --> 30:06.333
Let's look at it this way.

30:06.468 --> 30:10.063
Now, this phony broad,
excuse the language,

30:10.172 --> 30:12.640
she tells me she's you. She hires me.

30:12.775 --> 30:14.936
Now, whoever put her up to it
doesn't have anything against me.

30:15.043 --> 30:16.169
They're out to get your husband.

30:16.311 --> 30:18.779
If I can see him, I can help him.

30:21.950 --> 30:24.441
Did you talk to him this morning?

30:25.154 --> 30:26.178
No.

30:26.889 --> 30:28.652
I went riding rather early.

30:29.458 --> 30:31.289
Looks like you went quite a distance.

30:31.393 --> 30:33.327
I was riding bareback.

30:34.963 --> 30:36.123
You...

30:36.999 --> 30:39.490
You might try the Oak Pass
or the Stone Canyon Reservoir.

30:39.635 --> 30:41.432
Frequently, at lunch,
Hollis takes walks around them.

30:41.537 --> 30:43.027
Otherwise, he'll be home by 6:30.

30:43.172 --> 30:44.833
I'll stop by.

30:44.973 --> 30:46.702
Please call first.

31:03.225 --> 31:05.318
Sorry, closed to public, sir.

31:05.994 --> 31:08.326
Oh, that's all right, Officer.

31:09.765 --> 31:12.825
Russ Yelburton,
Deputy Chief of the department.

31:13.368 --> 31:16.531
- Sorry, Mr. Yelburton. Go on down.
- That's okay.

31:42.364 --> 31:44.559
- Gittes! For Christ's sake!
- Loach.

31:44.700 --> 31:46.861
- Get out of here before he sees you.
- What are you talking about?

31:46.969 --> 31:49.267
- What's going on here?
- Loach!

31:50.906 --> 31:52.373
Hello, Jake.

31:53.242 --> 31:55.039
Lou. How are you?

31:56.278 --> 32:00.908
Lousy cold I can't seem to shake,
but otherwise, I'm okay.

32:01.049 --> 32:05.179
- Yeah, summer colds are the worst.
- Yeah, they are.

32:05.287 --> 32:06.720
There's no smoking here, sir...

32:06.822 --> 32:09.689
That's all right, Officer.
We can make an exception this time.

32:09.791 --> 32:13.056
I'll see he's careful with the matches
and doesn't burn himself.

32:13.161 --> 32:14.788
Thanks, Lou.

32:14.930 --> 32:17.228
How'd you get past the guard?

32:18.066 --> 32:20.796
Well, to tell you the truth, I lied a little.

32:21.970 --> 32:24.905
You look like
you've done well by yourself.

32:25.007 --> 32:26.031
I get by.

32:26.141 --> 32:29.542
Well, sometimes it takes a while
for a man to find himself.

32:29.645 --> 32:30.805
Maybe you have.

32:30.946 --> 32:33.972
Yeah, going through
other people's dirty linen.

32:34.116 --> 32:37.950
Yeah. Tell me,
you still putting Chinamen in jail

32:38.086 --> 32:40.316
for spitting in the laundry?

32:41.089 --> 32:43.319
You're a little behind the times, Jake.

32:43.458 --> 32:45.483
They use steam irons now.

32:45.761 --> 32:47.786
And I'm out of Chinatown.

32:48.463 --> 32:49.896
Since when?

32:50.332 --> 32:52.425
Since I made lieutenant.

32:53.435 --> 32:54.766
Congratulations.

32:56.138 --> 32:59.733
- What are you doing around here?
- I'm looking for somebody.

32:59.841 --> 33:00.967
Who?

33:01.543 --> 33:03.841
Hollis Mulwray. You seen him?

33:04.446 --> 33:05.606
Yeah.

33:06.181 --> 33:08.240
I'd like to talk to him.

33:08.850 --> 33:11.114
So you'd like to talk to him, huh?

33:12.654 --> 33:14.588
You're welcome to try.

33:15.958 --> 33:17.425
There he is.

33:35.410 --> 33:39.141
Looks like he was washed down
the entire length of the run-off channel.

33:40.048 --> 33:42.516
- Could he swim?
- Of course.

33:43.852 --> 33:47.379
Obviously, the fall
must have knocked him unconscious.

33:49.224 --> 33:50.691
Mrs. Mulwray,

33:51.893 --> 33:55.021
this alleged affair
your husband was having.

33:56.064 --> 33:58.555
The publicity didn't make him

33:59.701 --> 34:01.498
morose, or unhappy?

34:02.938 --> 34:04.997
It didn't make him happy.

34:05.107 --> 34:07.905
There is no possibility
that he would have taken his own life?

34:08.043 --> 34:09.168
No.

34:11.246 --> 34:12.838
Mrs. Mulwray,

34:13.882 --> 34:16.976
do you happen to know the name
of the young lady in question?

34:18.353 --> 34:19.411
No.

34:19.788 --> 34:21.847
- Or where she might be?
- Certainly not.

34:21.956 --> 34:24.824
You and your husband
never discussed her?

34:26.561 --> 34:27.721
He...

34:28.730 --> 34:29.924
We did.

34:30.565 --> 34:32.862
He wouldn't tell me her name.

34:33.368 --> 34:37.600
We quarrelled over her, of course.
It came as a complete surprise to me.

34:37.739 --> 34:39.706
A complete surprise?

34:39.808 --> 34:42.333
I thought you hired
a private investigator.

34:43.110 --> 34:45.579
A private investigator?

34:46.481 --> 34:47.947
Mr. Gittes.

34:53.822 --> 34:57.258
Yes, but I did that
because I thought I would put an end

34:57.392 --> 35:00.190
to a ridiculous rumor that had no basis.

35:03.565 --> 35:04.896
When did Mr. Gittes inform you

35:05.000 --> 35:07.560
that these rumors
had some foundation in fact?

35:07.669 --> 35:10.866
Just before the story
broke in the papers, Lou.

35:11.973 --> 35:14.305
You wouldn't happen to know
where I could find her?

35:14.443 --> 35:15.535
No.

35:16.144 --> 35:18.305
- Or her name?
- No.

35:19.347 --> 35:20.405
Of course not.

35:20.515 --> 35:22.710
Will you need me
for anything else, Lieutenant?

35:22.818 --> 35:24.979
Oh, no, no, Mrs. Mulwray,
I don't think so.

35:25.120 --> 35:28.556
If we need any more information,
we'll be in touch.

35:29.191 --> 35:31.955
Of course you have
my deepest sympathy.

35:33.295 --> 35:36.162
I'll see her to the car, Lou.
I'll be right back.

35:38.967 --> 35:42.266
- Jake, come on, what's the story?
- T ake it easy, guys. Let us get through.

35:42.370 --> 35:43.735
We better do this in a hurry.

35:43.839 --> 35:47.138
Let us through, guys!
Give us a little room!

35:48.777 --> 35:51.007
You want a picture, guys? Here it is!

35:51.146 --> 35:53.114
"Gittes", two T's and an E.

35:54.449 --> 35:57.680
Thank you for
going along with me back there.

35:58.186 --> 36:00.984
I just didn't want to explain anything.

36:01.556 --> 36:03.319
I'll send you a check.

36:03.458 --> 36:04.482
A check?

36:04.626 --> 36:07.493
T o make it official that I've hired you.

36:23.678 --> 36:26.203
I'll get to him this afternoon if I can.

36:26.348 --> 36:28.646
Jake, what are you doing here?

36:28.750 --> 36:30.274
Nothing, Morty. It's my lunch hour.

36:30.385 --> 36:33.115
Thought I'd drop by
and see who dropped dead lately.

36:33.221 --> 36:35.018
Yeah? Isn't this something?

36:35.657 --> 36:38.182
Middle of a drought,
and the Water Commissioner drowns.

36:38.326 --> 36:40.817
- Only in L. A.
- Yeah.

36:41.096 --> 36:44.361
- Looks pretty banged up.
- Well, it's a long fall.

36:49.604 --> 36:51.902
So how are you doing, Morty?

36:52.574 --> 36:55.805
Never better, except for this darn cough.

36:55.911 --> 36:58.141
- You know me, Jake.
- Yeah.

37:06.188 --> 37:07.917
Who you got there?

37:08.056 --> 37:10.991
Leroy Shuhardt, local drunk.

37:11.726 --> 37:14.422
Used to hang around Ferguson's Alley.

37:15.897 --> 37:17.728
Quite a character.

37:17.866 --> 37:21.768
Lately he'd been living
in one of the downtown storm drains.

37:23.271 --> 37:26.434
Had a bureau dresser down there
and everything.

37:27.309 --> 37:28.606
All right, there.

37:35.217 --> 37:37.208
Yeah. He drowned, too.

37:38.420 --> 37:39.614
Come again?

37:39.754 --> 37:43.349
Yeah. Got drunk, passed out
in the bottom of the riverbed.

37:43.458 --> 37:44.948
The L. A. River?

37:45.260 --> 37:48.718
Yeah, right under Hollenbeck Bridge.
What's wrong with that?

37:48.830 --> 37:51.025
Well, it's dry as a bone, Morty.

37:51.132 --> 37:53.464
It's not completely dry.

37:53.602 --> 37:56.366
Well, he ain't gonna exactly
drown in a damp riverbed,

37:56.471 --> 37:58.530
no matter how soused he is.

37:58.640 --> 38:01.268
We got water out of him. He drowned!

38:59.401 --> 39:00.629
Hello.

39:08.176 --> 39:09.370
Howdy.

39:09.844 --> 39:13.177
You were riding out here
the other day, weren't you?

39:15.317 --> 39:16.511
Do you speak English?

39:21.222 --> 39:25.124
You were talking to a man
a few days ago. He wore glasses...

39:25.560 --> 39:26.618
Yes.

39:28.063 --> 39:30.327
What did you talk about,
do you mind my asking?

39:30.432 --> 39:33.128
- The water.
- What about the water?

39:33.234 --> 39:35.566
- When it comes.
- When it comes?

39:36.671 --> 39:38.195
What did you tell him?

39:38.340 --> 39:40.865
It comes in different parts of the river.

39:41.009 --> 39:43.239
Every night a different part.

42:04.486 --> 42:08.445
Son of a bitch!
Goddamn Florsheim shoe.

42:16.499 --> 42:19.593
Hold it there, kitty-cat! Hold it!

42:25.574 --> 42:28.702
Hello, Claude.
Where'd you get the midget?

42:33.749 --> 42:36.582
You're a very nosy fellow, kitty-cat, huh?

42:36.685 --> 42:38.448
You know what happens
to nosy fellows?

42:38.587 --> 42:42.455
No? Want to guess? No?

42:42.591 --> 42:44.752
Okay. They lose their noses.

42:49.999 --> 42:52.263
Next time you lose the whole thing.

42:52.368 --> 42:55.132
Cut it off and feed it to my goldfish.

42:56.539 --> 42:57.631
Understand?

42:58.541 --> 43:00.099
- Understand?
- Don't you understand, Gittes?

43:00.209 --> 43:01.904
I understand.

43:02.011 --> 43:03.410
All right.

43:14.356 --> 43:16.483
So some contractor
wants to build a dam,

43:16.625 --> 43:19.093
and he makes a few payoffs. So what?

43:19.195 --> 43:22.687
Think you can nail Mulvihill?
They'll claim you were trespassing.

43:22.832 --> 43:24.424
Don't want Mulvihill.

43:24.533 --> 43:27.366
I want the big boys
that are making the payoffs.

43:27.503 --> 43:28.834
Then what do you do?

43:28.971 --> 43:30.598
Sue the shit out of them.

43:30.706 --> 43:32.173
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

43:34.577 --> 43:37.774
- What is it, Sophie?
- A Miss Sessions is calling.

43:38.247 --> 43:40.442
- Who?
- Ida Sessions.

43:42.184 --> 43:44.516
Don't know her. T ake a number.

43:44.987 --> 43:46.318
Sue people like that,

43:46.422 --> 43:50.722
they're liable to be having dinner
with the judge who's trying the suit.

43:51.227 --> 43:54.287
I'm sorry. Miss Sessions insists.

43:54.396 --> 43:56.330
She says you know her.

43:57.066 --> 43:58.192
Okay.

44:02.538 --> 44:05.871
Hello, Miss Sessions.
I don't believe we've had the pleasure.

44:06.008 --> 44:07.873
Oh, yes, we have.

44:08.010 --> 44:10.342
- Are you alone?
- lsn't everyone?

44:11.347 --> 44:13.247
What can I do for you?

44:14.550 --> 44:16.814
Well, I'm a working girl.

44:16.919 --> 44:19.217
I didn't come in to see you on my own.

44:19.355 --> 44:21.084
When did you come in?

44:21.223 --> 44:24.750
I was the one who pretended to be
Mrs. Mulwray. Remember?

44:24.894 --> 44:27.488
- Shut the fuck up.
- Beg your pardon?

44:27.930 --> 44:31.058
- Y es, I remember.
- Beg your pardon? Is something wrong?

44:31.167 --> 44:35.365
No. I was just checking a detail
or two with my two associates.

44:35.471 --> 44:36.563
Go on.

44:36.739 --> 44:40.140
I never expected anything to happen
like what happened to Mr. Mulwray.

44:40.276 --> 44:42.767
The point is, if it ever comes out,

44:42.912 --> 44:45.881
I want somebody to know
that I didn 't know what would happen.

44:45.981 --> 44:47.471
I understand.

44:48.484 --> 44:51.146
Who was your employer?
That could be helpful to both of us.

44:51.287 --> 44:52.777
Oh, no! Oh, no.

44:53.355 --> 44:54.481
No.

44:55.991 --> 44:58.289
What's your address?
Maybe we could talk this over.

44:58.427 --> 44:59.451
No, Mr. Gittes.

44:59.595 --> 45:02.621
Just look in the obituary column
of today's L. A. Post-Record.

45:02.765 --> 45:04.289
The obituary column?

45:04.433 --> 45:08.164
- You'll find one of those people.
- "Those people"? Miss...

45:10.139 --> 45:11.333
Sure.

45:12.474 --> 45:14.135
How do you like them apples?

45:45.074 --> 45:47.133
Ma'am.

45:51.547 --> 45:53.447
Thank you for coming.

46:00.923 --> 46:02.948
- Yes, sir?
- Drink?

46:03.692 --> 46:06.160
T om Collins.
With lime, not lemon, please.

46:06.262 --> 46:08.230
Tom Collins with lime.

46:11.533 --> 46:14.024
I got your check in the mail.

46:14.169 --> 46:17.366
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.

46:18.440 --> 46:21.705
Mrs. Mulwray,
I'm afraid that's not good enough.

46:25.581 --> 46:27.242
How much would you like?

46:27.383 --> 46:30.409
Oh, stop it, the money's fine.
It's generous.

46:30.619 --> 46:35.522
But I think you short-changed me
on the story.

46:36.392 --> 46:38.587
- I have?
- I think so.

46:38.727 --> 46:41.890
Something else besides the death
of your husband was bothering you.

46:42.031 --> 46:44.397
You were upset, but not that upset.

46:44.533 --> 46:47.525
Mr. Gittes, don't tell me how I feel.

46:51.206 --> 46:52.400
Sorry.

46:54.043 --> 46:58.446
Look, you sue me, your husband dies,
you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato,

46:58.580 --> 47:01.913
all of it quicker
than the wind from a duck's ass.

47:02.284 --> 47:03.683
Excuse me.

47:04.953 --> 47:09.185
- Then you ask me to lie to the police...
- lt wasn't much of a lie.

47:09.291 --> 47:11.759
If your husband was killed, it was.

47:11.894 --> 47:15.421
This could look like you paid me off
to withhold evidence.

47:15.564 --> 47:17.429
But he wasn't killed.

47:19.935 --> 47:22.961
Mrs. Mulwray,
I think you're hiding something.

47:28.110 --> 47:29.372
Well,

47:31.246 --> 47:32.770
I suppose I am.

47:34.083 --> 47:36.608
Actually, I knew about the affair.

47:37.653 --> 47:40.554
- How did you find out?
- My husband.

47:40.656 --> 47:42.123
He told you?

47:42.758 --> 47:45.283
And you weren't the least bit upset?

47:45.661 --> 47:47.219
I was grateful.

47:49.131 --> 47:51.395
Mrs. Mulwray, you'll have to explain that.

47:51.500 --> 47:52.626
Why?

47:53.369 --> 47:55.735
Look, I do matrimonial work.
It's my metier.

47:55.838 --> 47:58.773
When a wife tells me that she's happy
that her husband is cheating on her,

47:58.874 --> 48:01.434
it runs contrary to my experience.

48:02.044 --> 48:03.511
Unless what?

48:06.215 --> 48:08.240
She was cheating on him.

48:10.886 --> 48:12.285
Were you?

48:17.393 --> 48:19.588
I dislike the word "cheat".

48:20.829 --> 48:22.296
Did you have affairs?

48:22.398 --> 48:25.094
- Mr. Gittes...
- Did he know about it?

48:26.635 --> 48:29.433
Well, I wouldn't run home and tell him
every time I went to bed with someone,

48:29.538 --> 48:31.597
if that's what you mean.

48:31.907 --> 48:34.341
Is there anything else you want
to know about me?

48:34.743 --> 48:37.473
Where were you
when your husband died?

48:38.080 --> 48:39.513
I can't tell you.

48:39.648 --> 48:41.172
You mean you don't know
where you were?

48:41.316 --> 48:44.615
- I mean I can't tell you.
- You were seeing someone, too.

48:46.422 --> 48:48.117
For very long?

48:48.223 --> 48:51.317
I don't see anyone
for very long, Mr. Gittes.

48:51.827 --> 48:53.795
It's difficult for me.

48:56.765 --> 49:00.667
Now, I think you know
all you need know about me.

49:02.271 --> 49:03.329
I didn't want publicity.

49:03.439 --> 49:06.738
I didn't want to go
into any of this, then or now.

49:07.676 --> 49:08.836
Is that all?

49:13.048 --> 49:16.575
By the way,
what does this "C" stand for?

49:18.887 --> 49:19.979
"Cross."

49:22.558 --> 49:24.890
- It's your maiden name?
- Yes.

49:25.394 --> 49:26.520
Why?

49:27.262 --> 49:28.661
No reason.

49:29.031 --> 49:31.056
You must've had a reason
to ask me that.

49:31.200 --> 49:33.031
No. I'm just a snoop.

49:38.974 --> 49:42.273
No. I have my own car. The Packard.

49:42.411 --> 49:44.276
Wait a minute, sonny.

49:44.413 --> 49:46.540
I think you better come with me.

49:46.648 --> 49:48.878
But why? There's nothing more to say.

49:48.984 --> 49:51.248
Will you get my car, please?

49:53.956 --> 49:55.287
Okay, go home.

49:55.424 --> 49:59.190
But in case you're interested,
your husband was murdered.

49:59.294 --> 50:01.558
Somebody's been dumping
thousands of tonnes of water

50:01.663 --> 50:02.789
from the city's reservoirs,

50:02.931 --> 50:05.263
and we're supposed to be
in the middle of a drought.

50:05.400 --> 50:08.062
He found out about it, and he was killed.

50:08.170 --> 50:10.035
There's a waterlogged drunk
in the morgue.

50:10.138 --> 50:12.606
Involuntary manslaughter,
if anybody wants to take the trouble,

50:12.741 --> 50:13.765
which they don't.

50:13.909 --> 50:16.104
It seems like half the city
is trying to cover it all up,

50:16.245 --> 50:18.076
which is fine by me.

50:19.414 --> 50:20.904
But, Mrs. Mulwray,

50:21.016 --> 50:23.314
I goddamn near lost my nose,

50:23.452 --> 50:24.714
and I like it.

50:24.820 --> 50:26.720
I like breathing through it.

50:26.822 --> 50:29.985
And I still think
that you're hiding something.

50:38.700 --> 50:40.463
Mr. Gittes...

50:50.178 --> 50:53.079
J. J. Gittes to see Mr. Yelburton.

51:23.345 --> 51:26.178
Mr. Yelburton will be busy
for some time.

51:26.548 --> 51:29.984
Well, it's my lunch hour. I can wait.

51:30.419 --> 51:33.217
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.

51:33.855 --> 51:35.948
I take a long lunch hour.

51:37.593 --> 51:39.993
All day, sometimes.

52:39.921 --> 52:42.412
Noah Cross worked
for the Water Department.

52:42.557 --> 52:43.854
Yes.

52:43.959 --> 52:46.223
- No.
- Well, did he or didn't he?

52:46.328 --> 52:48.296
He owned it.

52:49.598 --> 52:52.066
He owned the Water Department?

52:52.167 --> 52:53.293
Yes.

52:54.836 --> 52:58.636
You mean, he owned
the entire water supply for the city?

52:58.774 --> 52:59.900
Yes.

53:05.013 --> 53:07.709
How did they get it away from him?

53:07.816 --> 53:11.252
Mr. Mulwray felt
the public should own the water.

53:11.353 --> 53:13.116
Mr. Mulwray?

53:13.255 --> 53:15.815
I thought you said Cross owned it.

53:15.957 --> 53:17.891
Along with Mr. Mulwray.

53:19.027 --> 53:22.929
- They were partners?
- Yes! Yes, they were partners.

54:00.702 --> 54:03.330
Mr. Yelburton will see you now.

54:08.910 --> 54:11.140
Mr. Gittes, sorry to keep you waiting.

54:11.246 --> 54:14.443
These staff meetings,
they just go on and on.

54:14.549 --> 54:18.781
Yeah. Must be especially tough
to take over under these circumstances.

54:18.887 --> 54:22.880
Yes. Hollis was the best
department chief the city's ever had.

54:23.658 --> 54:25.956
My goodness,
what happened to your nose?

54:26.061 --> 54:27.858
Cut myself shaving.

54:29.030 --> 54:32.022
Well, you ought to be more careful.
That must really smart.

54:32.167 --> 54:33.998
Only when I breathe.

54:38.240 --> 54:40.174
Only when you breathe.

54:40.876 --> 54:43.845
Don't tell me you're still working
for Mrs. Mulwray.

54:43.945 --> 54:46.311
- I never was.
- I don't understand.

54:47.382 --> 54:49.247
Neither do l, actually.

54:49.384 --> 54:50.874
You hired me.

54:51.853 --> 54:54.253
Or you hired that chippy to hire me.

54:54.890 --> 54:57.984
Mr. Gittes, you're not making
a bit of sense.

54:59.060 --> 55:01.255
Well, let's look at it this way.

55:01.396 --> 55:03.557
Mulwray didn't want to build a dam.

55:03.698 --> 55:05.893
He had a reputation
that was hard to get around.

55:06.034 --> 55:07.831
You decided to ruin it.

55:07.936 --> 55:11.269
Then he found out
you were dumping water at night.

55:12.040 --> 55:13.530
Then he was...

55:13.942 --> 55:15.204
Drowned.

55:16.111 --> 55:18.944
Mr. Gittes,
that's an outrageous accusation.

55:19.080 --> 55:21.378
I don't know what you're talking about.

55:21.483 --> 55:25.283
Well, Whitey Mehrholtz
over at the Times will.

55:25.420 --> 55:27.945
Dumping thousands of gallons of water
down the toilet

55:28.089 --> 55:30.922
in the middle of a drought, that's news.

55:32.794 --> 55:34.386
Mr. Gittes,

55:35.397 --> 55:36.694
we're...

55:38.233 --> 55:41.293
We're not anxious for this to get around,
but we have been diverting a little water

55:41.436 --> 55:44.405
to irrigate orange groves
in the Northwest Valley.

55:44.506 --> 55:47.202
As you know, the farmers out there
have no legal right to our water,

55:47.309 --> 55:48.901
but we've been trying to help
some of them out,

55:49.010 --> 55:50.944
keep them from going under.

55:51.079 --> 55:54.776
Naturally, when you divert water,
there's a little run-off.

55:54.916 --> 55:56.975
Yeah. A little run-off.

55:57.819 --> 56:01.482
- Where'd you say those groves were?
- ln the Northwest Valley.

56:01.623 --> 56:04.387
That's like saying they're in Arizona.

56:04.793 --> 56:09.287
Mr. Gittes, my field men are out.
I can't give you the exact location.

56:09.798 --> 56:12.460
- You're a married man, aren't you?
- Yes.

56:12.601 --> 56:15.570
Hard-working? Wife? Kids?

56:16.371 --> 56:17.599
Yes.

56:17.706 --> 56:19.799
I don't want to nail you.

56:24.713 --> 56:27.477
I want to find out who put you up to it.

56:27.616 --> 56:29.846
I'll give you a few days to think about it.

56:29.985 --> 56:31.816
Call me. I can help.

56:32.520 --> 56:33.612
Who knows?

56:33.722 --> 56:37.283
Maybe we can put the whole thing off
on a few big-shots,

56:37.392 --> 56:38.984
and you can stay
the head of the department

56:39.127 --> 56:40.992
for the next 20 years.

57:22.704 --> 57:25.070
- Drink?
- No, thank you.

57:30.412 --> 57:32.539
What is your usual salary?

57:33.448 --> 57:37.407
$35 a day, plus 20 to my associates,

57:38.119 --> 57:39.677
plus expenses,

57:40.622 --> 57:43.022
plus a bonus if I show results.

57:46.361 --> 57:50.092
Whoever is behind my husband's death,
why have they gone to all this trouble?

57:50.231 --> 57:51.425
Money.

57:52.300 --> 57:54.860
How they plan to make it
out of emptying reservoirs,

57:54.970 --> 57:56.699
that I don't know.

57:57.072 --> 57:58.869
I'll pay your salary,

57:58.974 --> 58:00.601
plus $5,000

58:01.109 --> 58:05.045
if you find out what happened to Hollis,
and who is involved.

58:09.384 --> 58:13.548
Sophie, draw up one of our
standard contracts for Mrs. Mulwray.

58:13.655 --> 58:15.384
Yes, Mr. Gittes.

58:19.227 --> 58:21.252
T ell me something.

58:21.396 --> 58:24.365
Did you get married before or after
Mulwray and your father

58:24.466 --> 58:26.593
sold the Water Department?

58:27.002 --> 58:29.630
Noah Cross is your father, isn't he?

58:32.340 --> 58:33.932
Yes, of course.

58:34.576 --> 58:36.476
It was sometime after.

58:37.445 --> 58:40.778
I was just out of grade school
when they did that.

58:42.450 --> 58:45.715
Then you married
your father's business partner.

58:48.490 --> 58:51.459
You've already got one going,
Mrs. Mulwray.

58:53.194 --> 58:57.130
Does my talking about your father
upset you?

58:57.265 --> 58:58.562
Why, no.

58:59.834 --> 59:01.392
Yes. A little.

59:01.503 --> 59:03.596
You see, Hollis and my...

59:05.173 --> 59:06.231
My father

59:06.875 --> 59:08.968
had a falling-out finally.

59:10.345 --> 59:13.314
Over you
or over the Water Department?

59:13.448 --> 59:15.609
Not over me. Why should it be over me?

59:15.717 --> 59:17.344
Then it was over
the Water Department.

59:17.485 --> 59:18.474
Yes.

59:19.721 --> 59:22.155
Hollis felt that the water
should belong to the public,

59:22.290 --> 59:26.021
and I don't think my father felt that way.

59:26.694 --> 59:29.322
Actually, it was over
the Van der Lip Dam.

59:29.464 --> 59:30.761
You know, the dam that broke?

59:30.865 --> 59:34.198
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes. Hollis never forgave him for it.

59:34.335 --> 59:38.533
- Never forgave him for what?
- For talking him into building it.

59:38.673 --> 59:41.267
They never spoke from that time on.

59:45.313 --> 59:47.144
You sure about that?

59:48.049 --> 59:49.846
Of course I'm sure.

59:54.689 --> 59:56.020
Sign here.

59:57.525 --> 59:59.322
The copy's for you.

01:01:01.422 --> 01:01:03.856
- Mr. Gitts?
- Gittes.

01:01:04.893 --> 01:01:06.417
How do you do?

01:01:06.995 --> 01:01:10.761
You've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gitts.
I like that.

01:01:11.633 --> 01:01:12.725
Thanks.

01:01:12.834 --> 01:01:14.734
If you were a bank president,
that would be one thing,

01:01:14.836 --> 01:01:16.929
but in your business, it's admirable.

01:01:17.105 --> 01:01:18.970
And it's good advertising.

01:01:19.107 --> 01:01:20.131
It doesn't hurt.

01:01:20.275 --> 01:01:23.574
It's why you attracted
a client like my daughter.

01:01:24.412 --> 01:01:25.470
Probably.

01:01:25.613 --> 01:01:27.444
But I'm surprised
you're still working for her,

01:01:27.582 --> 01:01:30.050
unless she's suddenly come up
with another husband.

01:01:30.151 --> 01:01:34.212
No. She happens to think
the last one was murdered.

01:01:36.191 --> 01:01:38.250
How'd she get that idea?

01:01:38.826 --> 01:01:40.919
I think I gave it to her.

01:01:42.096 --> 01:01:45.964
I hope you don't mind. I believe
they should be served with the head.

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:49.331
Fine. Long as you don't serve
chicken that way.

01:01:51.439 --> 01:01:54.636
T ell me, what do the police say?

01:01:54.776 --> 01:01:57.108
They're calling it an accident.

01:01:58.213 --> 01:02:02.240
- Who's the investigating officer?
- Lou Escobar. He's a lieutenant.

01:02:02.350 --> 01:02:04.910
- Do you know him?
- Oh, yeah.

01:02:05.453 --> 01:02:06.852
Where from?

01:02:07.655 --> 01:02:10.419
We used to work together.
In Chinatown.

01:02:12.393 --> 01:02:14.827
Would you call him a capable man?

01:02:15.663 --> 01:02:16.823
Very.

01:02:17.332 --> 01:02:18.594
Honest?

01:02:18.967 --> 01:02:20.366
As far as it goes.

01:02:21.236 --> 01:02:24.330
Of course, he has to swim
in the same water we all do.

01:02:24.472 --> 01:02:28.033
Of course, but you've no reason to think
he's bungled the case?

01:02:28.176 --> 01:02:30.474
- None.
- That's too bad.

01:02:31.412 --> 01:02:32.777
T oo bad?

01:02:33.548 --> 01:02:37.143
It disturbs me. Makes me think
you're taking my daughter for a ride.

01:02:37.252 --> 01:02:39.686
Financially speaking, of course.

01:02:40.655 --> 01:02:42.714
What are you charging her?

01:02:44.525 --> 01:02:48.518
My usual fee,
plus a bonus if I get results.

01:02:48.663 --> 01:02:50.722
Are you sleeping with her?

01:02:53.268 --> 01:02:54.326
Come, come, Mr. Gitts.

01:02:54.435 --> 01:02:58.132
You don't have to think about that
to remember, do you?

01:02:59.874 --> 01:03:02.001
If you want an answer
to that question, Mr. Cross,

01:03:02.110 --> 01:03:04.704
I'll put one of my men on the job.

01:03:06.281 --> 01:03:08.078
- Good afternoon.
- Mr. Gitts...

01:03:08.216 --> 01:03:09.877
- Gittes.
- Gittes.

01:03:10.685 --> 01:03:13.882
You're dealing with a disturbed woman
who just lost her husband.

01:03:14.022 --> 01:03:16.422
I don't want her taken advantage of.

01:03:16.557 --> 01:03:18.388
- Sit down.
- What for?

01:03:21.129 --> 01:03:24.496
You may think you know
what you're dealing with,

01:03:24.599 --> 01:03:26.726
but believe me, you don't.

01:03:27.769 --> 01:03:29.430
Why is that funny?

01:03:29.570 --> 01:03:32.698
It's what the District Attorney
used to tell me in Chinatown.

01:03:32.807 --> 01:03:34.604
Yeah? Was he right?

01:03:35.977 --> 01:03:38.946
Exactly what do you know about me?
Sit down.

01:03:44.652 --> 01:03:46.415
Mainly that you're rich,

01:03:46.554 --> 01:03:50.115
and too respectable
to want your name in the newspapers.

01:03:50.258 --> 01:03:52.886
Of course I'm respectable. I'm old.

01:03:54.595 --> 01:03:56.358
Politicians, ugly buildings, and whores

01:03:56.464 --> 01:03:59.558
all get respectable
if they last long enough.

01:04:00.134 --> 01:04:03.399
I'll double whatever your fee is
and pay you $10,000

01:04:03.504 --> 01:04:05.904
if you find Hollis' girlfriend.

01:04:06.441 --> 01:04:09.137
- Girlfriend?
- Disappeared, hasn't she?

01:04:09.277 --> 01:04:10.437
Yeah.

01:04:11.179 --> 01:04:13.704
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?

01:04:13.815 --> 01:04:15.043
Maybe.

01:04:16.818 --> 01:04:17.807
If Mulwray was murdered,

01:04:17.952 --> 01:04:21.149
she'd be one of the last
to have seen him alive.

01:04:21.456 --> 01:04:24.152
When's the last time you saw Mulwray?

01:04:25.593 --> 01:04:27.891
Sheriff's gold posse.
Bunch of damn fools

01:04:27.995 --> 01:04:31.954
who pay $5,000 apiece
towards the Sheriff's re-election.

01:04:32.533 --> 01:04:34.967
I let them practice up out here.

01:04:36.137 --> 01:04:37.297
Yeah.

01:04:39.006 --> 01:04:41.941
Do you remember the last time
you saw Mulwray?

01:04:42.043 --> 01:04:44.568
At my age, you tend to forget.

01:04:46.013 --> 01:04:48.675
It was five days ago outside
The Pig'n Whistle,

01:04:48.816 --> 01:04:51.512
and you had one hell of an argument.

01:04:51.652 --> 01:04:55.611
I got the pictures in my office,
if that'll help you remember.

01:04:58.693 --> 01:05:01.685
- What was the argument about?
- My daughter.

01:05:03.564 --> 01:05:05.156
What about her?

01:05:05.733 --> 01:05:09.533
Just find the girl, Mr. Gitts.

01:05:12.673 --> 01:05:16.632
I happen to know Hollis was fond of her.

01:05:17.578 --> 01:05:19.637
I'd like to help her if I can.

01:05:19.747 --> 01:05:23.615
I had no idea you and Hollis
were that fond of one another.

01:05:24.552 --> 01:05:26.850
Hollis Mulwray made this city,

01:05:27.555 --> 01:05:29.648
and he made me a fortune.

01:05:31.392 --> 01:05:34.520
We were a lot closer
than Evelyn realized.

01:05:37.331 --> 01:05:41.961
If you want to hire me, I still have to
know what the argument was about.

01:05:43.204 --> 01:05:45.468
My daughter's a very jealous woman.

01:05:45.573 --> 01:05:48.633
I didn't want her to find out
about the girl.

01:05:48.910 --> 01:05:50.707
How did you find out?

01:05:50.845 --> 01:05:55.077
I still got a few teeth left in my head,
and a few friends in town.

01:05:58.085 --> 01:05:59.177
Okay.

01:06:00.955 --> 01:06:02.183
I'll...

01:06:03.624 --> 01:06:06.559
I'll have my secretary
draw up the papers.

01:06:07.261 --> 01:06:08.523
T ell me,

01:06:09.697 --> 01:06:13.724
are you frightened for the girl
or what Evelyn might do to her?

01:06:13.868 --> 01:06:15.665
Just find the girl.

01:06:17.205 --> 01:06:18.900
I'll look into it,

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:22.168
as soon as I've checked out
some orange groves.

01:06:23.144 --> 01:06:24.668
Orange groves?

01:06:25.713 --> 01:06:28.011
We'll be in touch, Mr. Cross.

01:06:33.254 --> 01:06:35.245
I'm a little lost.
I wonder if you could you tell me

01:06:35.389 --> 01:06:38.085
where the plat books
for the Northwest Valley are?

01:06:38.226 --> 01:06:40.023
Part of it's in Ventura County.

01:06:40.127 --> 01:06:43.563
We don't have Ventura County
in our Hall of Records.

01:06:44.065 --> 01:06:47.228
Well, then, I'll settle
for Los Angeles County.

01:06:48.102 --> 01:06:49.797
Row 23, section C.

01:06:54.308 --> 01:06:55.536
Weasel.

01:07:51.032 --> 01:07:52.431
Say, sonny,

01:07:54.669 --> 01:07:58.298
why do they have all those names
pasted in the plat books?

01:07:58.406 --> 01:08:01.864
Land sales out of escrow
are always recorded within the week.

01:08:02.009 --> 01:08:05.137
- Then these are all new owners?
- That's right.

01:08:06.347 --> 01:08:09.805
Well, that means that most of the Valley
sold in the last few months.

01:08:09.917 --> 01:08:11.885
If that's what it says.

01:08:13.554 --> 01:08:16.182
Can I check one of these volumes out?

01:08:17.158 --> 01:08:21.185
Sir, this is not a lending library.
It's the Hall of Records.

01:08:21.328 --> 01:08:24.229
- How about a ruler?
- A ruler?

01:08:25.265 --> 01:08:28.497
Yeah. The print's real fine.
I left my glasses home.

01:08:28.603 --> 01:08:31.197
I'd like to be able to read across.

01:08:43.117 --> 01:08:44.709
Why, thank you.

01:09:51.919 --> 01:09:53.648
Hold it right there!

01:11:02.223 --> 01:11:04.521
All right, quit it. Quit, now!

01:11:04.658 --> 01:11:07.149
Search the man. See if he's armed.

01:11:20.241 --> 01:11:23.404
I said see if he's armed,
not empty his pockets!

01:11:23.844 --> 01:11:25.812
Search him. Search him!

01:11:27.014 --> 01:11:28.743
He ain't armed.

01:11:28.883 --> 01:11:30.350
All right, mister, who you with,

01:11:30.451 --> 01:11:33.579
the Water Department
or the Real Estate Office?

01:11:34.421 --> 01:11:35.911
- Get away from me!
- Answer him!

01:11:36.056 --> 01:11:37.421
You come near me
with that thing again,

01:11:37.558 --> 01:11:38.582
you're gonna need a pair of them!

01:11:38.726 --> 01:11:40.523
Why don't you pick on somebody
your own size?

01:11:40.628 --> 01:11:44.530
I said cut that out! Give the man
a chance to say something!

01:11:48.235 --> 01:11:51.898
The name's Gittes.
I'm a private investigator.

01:11:52.039 --> 01:11:53.700
I'm not with either one of them.

01:11:54.909 --> 01:11:57.275
Then what you doing out here, mister?

01:11:57.611 --> 01:11:59.602
A client hired me to see...

01:12:00.714 --> 01:12:03.444
T o see if the Water Department
was irrigating your land.

01:12:03.584 --> 01:12:05.245
Irrigating my land?

01:12:05.386 --> 01:12:06.944
The Water Department's been sending
you people out here

01:12:07.087 --> 01:12:09.783
to blow up my water tanks,
they put poison down three of my wells.

01:12:09.924 --> 01:12:12.017
I call that a funny way to irrigate.

01:12:12.126 --> 01:12:14.856
Who'd hire you for a thing like that?

01:12:19.967 --> 01:12:21.366
Mrs. Evelyn Mulwray.

01:12:21.468 --> 01:12:24.437
Mulwray? That's the son of a bitch
who's done it to us.

01:12:24.572 --> 01:12:29.100
Mulwray's dead. You don't know what
you're talking about, you dumb Okie.

01:12:36.517 --> 01:12:37.950
Well, that's that.

01:13:05.705 --> 01:13:07.332
What's going on?

01:13:07.808 --> 01:13:09.435
You didn't look too good,

01:13:09.543 --> 01:13:12.512
so we thought we better call
your employer.

01:13:17.050 --> 01:13:18.813
Thanks for coming.

01:13:22.956 --> 01:13:26.084
- That dam's a con job.
- What dam?

01:13:26.193 --> 01:13:29.924
The one your husband opposed.
They're conning L. A. into building it.

01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:32.760
But the water's not gonna go to L. A.,
it's coming right here.

01:13:32.866 --> 01:13:34.026
To the Valley?

01:13:34.167 --> 01:13:36.601
Everything you can see.
Everything around us.

01:13:36.703 --> 01:13:39.194
I was at the Hall of Records today.

01:13:45.412 --> 01:13:49.178
In the last three months,
Robert Knox has bought 7,000 acres,

01:13:49.316 --> 01:13:52.979
Emma Dill, 12,000,
Clarence Speer, 5,000,

01:13:53.086 --> 01:13:56.283
and Jasper Lamar Crabb, 25,000 acres.

01:13:56.389 --> 01:13:58.357
- Jasper Lamar Crabb?
- You know him?

01:13:58.492 --> 01:14:02.189
- I think I would've remembered.
- Yeah.

01:14:02.329 --> 01:14:04.126
They're blowing these farmers
out of their land

01:14:04.231 --> 01:14:05.664
and then picking it up for peanuts.

01:14:05.765 --> 01:14:10.327
You have any idea what this land would
be worth with a steady water supply?

01:14:10.437 --> 01:14:13.406
About $30 million more
than they paid for it.

01:14:15.208 --> 01:14:18.575
- Hollis knew about this?
- That's why he was killed.

01:14:20.580 --> 01:14:22.377
Jasper Lamar Crabb.

01:14:23.216 --> 01:14:25.184
Jasper Lamar Crabb.

01:14:27.721 --> 01:14:29.416
- We got it!
- What?

01:14:29.556 --> 01:14:31.080
- We got it.
- What? What is it?

01:14:31.224 --> 01:14:34.216
"A memorial service was held
at the Mar Vista lnn today

01:14:34.361 --> 01:14:35.419
"for Jasper Lamar Crabb."

01:14:35.562 --> 01:14:37.928
He passed away two weeks ago.

01:14:38.932 --> 01:14:40.593
Why is that unusual?

01:14:41.067 --> 01:14:44.764
He passed away two weeks ago,
and one week ago he bought the land.

01:14:44.905 --> 01:14:46.497
That's unusual.

01:15:30.317 --> 01:15:33.650
Hello, there. I'm Mr. Palmer.
Can I help you folks?

01:15:34.154 --> 01:15:35.917
Yes, I hope so.

01:15:37.324 --> 01:15:38.621
It's Dad.

01:15:39.125 --> 01:15:40.752
I can't seem to handle him anymore.

01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:43.158
- Can l, sweetheart?
- My goodness.

01:15:43.296 --> 01:15:45.764
Nothing with Dad. It's me.

01:15:45.932 --> 01:15:48.457
Oh, no, no, Dad is an absolute angel
with everyone else.

01:15:48.602 --> 01:15:51.628
- It's just that he and my...
- Oh, I don't know.

01:15:51.771 --> 01:15:54.604
Of course, I'm anxious
for him to have the best,

01:15:54.708 --> 01:15:56.471
and money is no object.

01:15:56.610 --> 01:15:59.306
Perhaps if we met with your father.

01:15:59.946 --> 01:16:02.642
- There is one question.
- Of course.

01:16:02.782 --> 01:16:05.910
Do you accept people
of the Jewish persuasion?

01:16:06.653 --> 01:16:08.518
I'm sorry, but we don't.

01:16:08.655 --> 01:16:10.282
Don't be sorry. Neither does Dad.

01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:13.325
We just wanted to be sure,
didn't we, hon?

01:16:13.493 --> 01:16:17.759
Would it be possible for me to see
a list of your patients, just to be certain?

01:16:17.864 --> 01:16:21.960
We never reveal the names
of our guests as a matter of policy.

01:16:22.068 --> 01:16:24.161
You would appreciate that
if your father came to live with us.

01:16:24.304 --> 01:16:27.501
That's exactly
what I wanted to hear you say.

01:16:27.641 --> 01:16:28.699
Good.

01:16:28.842 --> 01:16:31.174
I wonder, is it too late
for us to have a look around?

01:16:31.311 --> 01:16:32.539
No. Allow me to show you.

01:16:32.679 --> 01:16:35.273
Would you mind
if we took a stroll on our own?

01:16:35.382 --> 01:16:37.782
Just if you'll confine yourself
to the main building.

01:16:37.884 --> 01:16:39.613
It's almost bedtime.

01:16:39.719 --> 01:16:42.950
We understand. Come, my sweet.

01:16:55.368 --> 01:16:57.962
Charlie! You ought to know
better than that!

01:16:58.071 --> 01:17:00.005
Sit down. Have a chair.

01:17:19.726 --> 01:17:22.854
They're all there. Every goddamn name.

01:17:28.968 --> 01:17:32.495
You're looking at the owners
of a 50,000-acre empire.

01:17:32.605 --> 01:17:34.095
They can't be.

01:17:38.645 --> 01:17:41.239
They may not know it, but they are.

01:17:42.949 --> 01:17:44.610
- Hello, girls.
- Hello.

01:17:44.751 --> 01:17:47.219
- Hello.
- Are any of you Emma Dill?

01:17:48.922 --> 01:17:51.550
- Yes? Are you Emma?
- Yes.

01:17:51.658 --> 01:17:54.218
Well, I've been wanting to meet you
for a long time.

01:17:54.327 --> 01:17:55.351
Why?

01:17:55.462 --> 01:17:57.623
Did you know you were
a very wealthy woman?

01:17:57.764 --> 01:17:59.561
Oh, I'm not.

01:17:59.666 --> 01:18:03.727
- Yes, you are. You own a lot of land.
- No more.

01:18:04.571 --> 01:18:05.765
Some time ago,

01:18:05.905 --> 01:18:09.898
my late husband owned a good deal
of beach property at Long Beach,

01:18:10.009 --> 01:18:11.601
but we lost it.

01:18:12.078 --> 01:18:14.603
- That's very beautiful.
- Thanks.

01:18:15.315 --> 01:18:17.283
Where did you get
this piece of material?

01:18:17.417 --> 01:18:19.282
At the Abbacore Club.

01:18:19.619 --> 01:18:23.214
- Abbacore?
- No. The Albacore.

01:18:23.323 --> 01:18:25.257
It's a fish.

01:18:25.358 --> 01:18:30.057
My grandson is a member,
and they take very nice care of us.

01:18:30.163 --> 01:18:32.063
How do they do that?

01:18:32.165 --> 01:18:36.261
Oh, give us things,
not just like this old flag, but...

01:18:36.836 --> 01:18:37.825
But what?

01:18:37.971 --> 01:18:41.270
We're a sort of unofficial charity
of theirs, Mr. Gittes.

01:18:42.442 --> 01:18:46.503
Would you come with me, please?
Someone wants to talk with you.

01:18:49.282 --> 01:18:50.271
Goodbye, ladies.

01:18:50.383 --> 01:18:51.407
- Bye!
- Bye!

01:18:59.659 --> 01:19:02.651
Come on.
I want you to meet someone, Gittes.

01:19:02.796 --> 01:19:04.957
Can we leave the lady out of this?

01:19:05.064 --> 01:19:08.261
- Yeah. Why not?
- I'd like to see her to the car.

01:19:08.368 --> 01:19:11.098
- She knows where it's at.
- I'll stay.

01:19:11.838 --> 01:19:13.430
Get in the car.

01:20:34.087 --> 01:20:35.782
Maid's night off?

01:20:37.123 --> 01:20:39.717
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

01:20:39.826 --> 01:20:43.762
- Nobody's here, that's why.
- I gave everyone the night off.

01:20:44.631 --> 01:20:46.792
Easy. It's an innocent question.

01:20:46.933 --> 01:20:49.959
No question from you
is innocent, Mr. Gittes.

01:20:50.103 --> 01:20:51.968
I guess you're right.

01:20:55.074 --> 01:20:56.939
T o you, Mrs. Mulwray.

01:20:58.311 --> 01:21:00.779
Frankly, tonight, you saved my...

01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:02.877
You saved my neck.

01:21:06.019 --> 01:21:07.816
T ell me, Mr. Gittes,

01:21:09.188 --> 01:21:11.554
does this often happen to you?

01:21:13.159 --> 01:21:14.626
What's that?

01:21:15.528 --> 01:21:18.292
Well, I'm judging only on the basis
of one afternoon and an evening,

01:21:18.431 --> 01:21:20.592
but if this is how you go
about your work,

01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:24.466
I'd say you'd be lucky
to get through a whole day.

01:21:26.172 --> 01:21:28.936
Actually, this hasn't happened to me
for a long time.

01:21:29.042 --> 01:21:31.010
When was the last time?

01:21:31.644 --> 01:21:32.736
Why?

01:21:33.513 --> 01:21:35.606
It's an innocent question.

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:43.619
- ln Chinatown.
- What were you doing there?

01:21:45.992 --> 01:21:49.450
- Working for the District Attorney.
- Doing what?

01:21:49.562 --> 01:21:51.291
As little as possible.

01:21:51.397 --> 01:21:54.855
The District Attorney gives his men
advice like that?

01:21:55.735 --> 01:21:57.635
They do in Chinatown.

01:21:58.805 --> 01:22:01.365
Why did you leave the police force?

01:22:05.011 --> 01:22:10.472
Do you have any peroxide,
or anything like that?

01:22:10.583 --> 01:22:13.143
Surely. Will you come this way?

01:22:30.536 --> 01:22:32.231
My God!

01:22:35.708 --> 01:22:37.403
It's a nasty cut.

01:22:39.412 --> 01:22:41.073
I had no idea...

01:22:46.185 --> 01:22:47.345
Sorry!

01:22:48.588 --> 01:22:49.816
There.

01:22:50.890 --> 01:22:52.414
Is it painful?

01:22:55.928 --> 01:22:57.691
It must be painful.

01:22:59.732 --> 01:23:01.222
What's wrong?

01:23:02.068 --> 01:23:03.365
Your eye.

01:23:06.706 --> 01:23:08.435
What about it? What?

01:23:09.075 --> 01:23:12.602
There's something black
in the green part of your eye.

01:23:13.379 --> 01:23:14.505
Oh, that.

01:23:15.081 --> 01:23:19.347
It's a flaw in the iris.

01:23:20.653 --> 01:23:22.780
- A flaw?
- Yes.

01:23:24.157 --> 01:23:26.216
A sort of birthmark.

01:24:02.028 --> 01:24:03.996
Did you wear a uniform?

01:24:05.698 --> 01:24:07.097
Sometimes.

01:24:09.168 --> 01:24:11.432
Must have looked cute in blue.

01:24:13.473 --> 01:24:15.498
Give me a break, will you?

01:24:16.042 --> 01:24:17.737
I don't know you.

01:24:19.045 --> 01:24:21.411
I want to know more about you.

01:24:21.981 --> 01:24:23.278
Not now.

01:24:25.551 --> 01:24:29.009
You really don't like to talk
about the past, do you?

01:24:31.557 --> 01:24:32.922
I'm tired.

01:24:33.793 --> 01:24:36.762
No. Why does it bother you
to talk about it?

01:24:37.396 --> 01:24:40.593
- lt bothers everybody that works there.
- Where?

01:24:41.634 --> 01:24:43.465
Chinatown. Everybody.

01:24:44.766 --> 01:24:46.466
To me, it was just bad luck.

01:24:47.421 --> 01:24:48.547
Why?

01:24:51.425 --> 01:24:54.155
You can't always tell what's going on.

01:24:56.297 --> 01:24:57.821
Like with you.

01:25:07.374 --> 01:25:08.773
Why was...

01:25:11.145 --> 01:25:12.942
Why was it bad luck?

01:25:17.785 --> 01:25:20.845
I was trying to keep someone
from being hurt.

01:25:21.522 --> 01:25:24.423
I ended up making sure
that she was hurt.

01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:35.260
Was there a woman involved?

01:25:37.037 --> 01:25:38.436
Of course.

01:25:40.074 --> 01:25:41.200
Dead?

01:25:54.588 --> 01:25:55.953
Yes, hello?

01:25:58.859 --> 01:26:02.659
Oh, my God.
No, look, don't do anything.

01:26:02.763 --> 01:26:05.357
Don't do anything until I get there.

01:26:09.503 --> 01:26:12.233
I have to go.

01:26:12.907 --> 01:26:16.570
- Where?
- Just that I have to.

01:26:17.111 --> 01:26:21.047
- I want to know where you're going.
- No, please. Don't be angry.

01:26:21.182 --> 01:26:24.049
It has nothing to do with you
or with any of all of this. It's just...

01:26:24.185 --> 01:26:26.551
- Where are you going?
- Please...

01:26:29.523 --> 01:26:31.252
Trust me this much.

01:26:41.969 --> 01:26:43.402
I'll be back.

01:26:48.909 --> 01:26:50.433
And there is...

01:26:52.213 --> 01:26:54.841
There is something
that I should tell you about.

01:26:54.949 --> 01:26:59.181
The fishing club
that old lady mentioned...

01:27:00.788 --> 01:27:03.780
- The pieces of the flag... Yes.
- The Albacore Club.

01:27:03.924 --> 01:27:06.552
- lt has to do with my father.
- I know.

01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:09.185
He owns it... You know?

01:27:10.164 --> 01:27:11.529
I saw him.

01:27:15.135 --> 01:27:16.568
You saw

01:27:17.571 --> 01:27:18.868
my father?

01:27:22.309 --> 01:27:25.210
- What... When?
- This morning.

01:27:28.315 --> 01:27:30.044
You didn't tell me.

01:27:30.417 --> 01:27:32.908
Well, there hasn't been much time.

01:27:33.454 --> 01:27:34.614
What...

01:27:35.356 --> 01:27:36.983
What did he say?

01:27:42.496 --> 01:27:44.088
What did he say?

01:27:44.632 --> 01:27:46.566
That you were jealous.

01:27:48.168 --> 01:27:50.159
And that he was afraid
what you might do.

01:27:50.304 --> 01:27:52.465
Do? To whom?

01:27:53.707 --> 01:27:56.005
Mulwray's girlfriend, for one.

01:27:58.445 --> 01:28:00.777
He wanted to know where she was.

01:28:03.984 --> 01:28:05.975
I want you to listen to me.

01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:10.648
Now, my father is
a very dangerous man.

01:28:10.791 --> 01:28:14.420
You don't know how dangerous.
You don't know how crazy.

01:28:15.629 --> 01:28:18.996
Are you trying to tell me
that he might be behind all this?

01:28:19.133 --> 01:28:20.623
It's possible.

01:28:27.141 --> 01:28:29.701
Even the death of your husband?

01:28:29.843 --> 01:28:31.333
It's possible.

01:28:31.578 --> 01:28:33.808
Now, please,
don't ask me any more questions now,

01:28:33.914 --> 01:28:36.041
just wait. Wait for me here.

01:28:37.184 --> 01:28:38.845
I need you here.

01:31:48.041 --> 01:31:49.406
No, no. Here.

01:32:18.872 --> 01:32:20.533
Give me the keys.

01:32:22.809 --> 01:32:23.867
You...

01:32:23.977 --> 01:32:27.413
It's either that
or you drive yourself to the police.

01:32:27.548 --> 01:32:28.913
The police?

01:32:29.650 --> 01:32:30.912
Come on, Mrs. Mulwray.

01:32:31.051 --> 01:32:34.612
You've got your husband's girlfriend
tied up in there.

01:32:34.755 --> 01:32:37.053
- She's not tied up.
- You know what I mean.

01:32:37.157 --> 01:32:40.388
- You're holding her against her will.
- I am not!

01:32:41.461 --> 01:32:44.191
- Okay. Then let's go talk to her.
- No!

01:32:45.933 --> 01:32:47.195
She's...

01:32:47.434 --> 01:32:49.095
She's too upset.

01:32:50.904 --> 01:32:52.303
What about?

01:32:52.973 --> 01:32:54.463
Hollis's death.

01:32:55.576 --> 01:32:56.770
I tried to keep it from her.

01:32:56.910 --> 01:33:01.404
I didn't want her to know until
I could make plans for us to leave.

01:33:01.515 --> 01:33:04.211
You mean she just found out about it?

01:33:06.353 --> 01:33:09.288
That's not what it looks like,
Mrs. Mulwray.

01:33:09.690 --> 01:33:11.658
What does it look like?

01:33:11.858 --> 01:33:14.986
Like she knows more
than you want her to tell.

01:33:16.530 --> 01:33:18.122
You're insane.

01:33:18.265 --> 01:33:20.756
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police.

01:33:20.867 --> 01:33:24.496
I don't care what you've done.
I don't want to hurt you.

01:33:28.642 --> 01:33:30.974
You won't go to the police if I tell you?

01:33:31.111 --> 01:33:32.908
I will if you don't.

01:33:47.060 --> 01:33:48.288
She...

01:33:48.395 --> 01:33:49.623
She...

01:33:50.530 --> 01:33:51.656
She...

01:33:52.966 --> 01:33:54.593
She's my sister.

01:34:01.008 --> 01:34:02.498
Take it easy.

01:34:03.310 --> 01:34:06.108
If she's your sister, she's your sister.

01:34:06.747 --> 01:34:08.544
Why all the secrecy?

01:34:10.751 --> 01:34:11.979
I can't.

01:34:12.085 --> 01:34:16.681
Is it because of Hollis? Because she
was seeing your husband? Is that it?

01:34:20.761 --> 01:34:23.229
I would never have harmed Hollis.

01:34:24.231 --> 01:34:27.997
He was the most gentle,
decent man imaginable.

01:34:30.270 --> 01:34:34.172
And he put up with more from me
than you'll ever know.

01:34:36.543 --> 01:34:40.240
I wanted him to be happy.

01:34:59.199 --> 01:35:03.363
I borrowed your husband's car.
I'll bring it back in the morning.

01:35:03.937 --> 01:35:06.235
But aren't you going...
Coming back with me?

01:35:06.373 --> 01:35:09.274
Don't worry.
I'm not going to tell anybody about this.

01:35:11.278 --> 01:35:13.246
That's not what I meant.

01:35:16.616 --> 01:35:17.742
Yeah.

01:35:18.652 --> 01:35:22.349
Well, I'm tired, Mrs. Mulwray.

01:35:23.557 --> 01:35:24.956
Good night.

01:36:30.357 --> 01:36:31.585
Gittes?

01:36:32.959 --> 01:36:34.449
- Gittes?
- Yeah?

01:36:35.028 --> 01:36:37.360
Ida Sessions wants to see you.

01:36:37.497 --> 01:36:41.160
- Who?
- Ida Sessions. You remember Ida.

01:36:42.702 --> 01:36:44.932
- Yeah, I do?
- Sure, you do.

01:36:48.475 --> 01:36:50.340
I tell you what, pal.

01:36:51.478 --> 01:36:55.812
If lda wants to see me,
she can call me at my office.

01:37:22.742 --> 01:37:27.304
848- 1/2 East Kensington. Echo Park.

01:37:27.414 --> 01:37:30.474
She begged me to call.
She's waiting for you.

01:40:37.937 --> 01:40:40.497
Find anything interesting, Gittes?

01:40:44.778 --> 01:40:46.837
What are you doing around here?

01:40:46.946 --> 01:40:48.743
Didn't you call me?

01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:52.916
How come you happen to know her?

01:40:53.319 --> 01:40:54.616
I don't.

01:40:57.490 --> 01:41:00.220
Come here.
I want to show you something.

01:41:09.502 --> 01:41:12.437
- lsn't that your phone number?
- ls it?

01:41:12.572 --> 01:41:14.767
I forget. I don't call myself that often.

01:41:14.908 --> 01:41:17.900
Well, just to make sure,
we had Loach here give you a call.

01:41:18.011 --> 01:41:19.638
What happened to your nose, Gittes?

01:41:19.779 --> 01:41:21.906
Somebody slam
a bedroom window on it?

01:41:24.584 --> 01:41:28.247
Nope. Your wife got excited.
She crossed her legs a little too quick.

01:41:28.354 --> 01:41:30.219
You understand what I mean, pal?

01:41:31.124 --> 01:41:32.284
Loach.

01:41:52.712 --> 01:41:54.475
They look familiar?

01:41:55.682 --> 01:41:58.981
- Yeah. I took them. So what?
- How did she happen to have them?

01:41:59.119 --> 01:42:02.680
Either you tell me or I guess.
I don't know the answer.

01:42:03.056 --> 01:42:05.320
You must really think I'm stupid,
don't you, Gittes?

01:42:05.458 --> 01:42:06.857
I don't think about it that much,

01:42:06.993 --> 01:42:09.985
but give me a day or two
and I'll get back to you.

01:42:10.130 --> 01:42:13.622
- Now I'd like to go home.
- I want the other pictures, Gittes.

01:42:13.733 --> 01:42:15.257
What pictures?

01:42:16.035 --> 01:42:19.471
This broad hired you,
not Evelyn Mulwray.

01:42:19.572 --> 01:42:21.005
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:42:22.142 --> 01:42:23.803
Somebody wanted
to shake Mulwray down,

01:42:23.910 --> 01:42:25.468
she hired you.

01:42:25.578 --> 01:42:28.046
That's how come you found out
he was murdered.

01:42:28.181 --> 01:42:31.173
- I heard it was an accident.
- Come on, Gittes.

01:42:31.317 --> 01:42:34.650
Who the hell do you think you're
dealing with, a bunch of assholes?

01:42:34.754 --> 01:42:37.052
Mulwray had salt water in his lungs.

01:42:39.159 --> 01:42:42.060
You were following him day and night.
You saw who killed him.

01:42:42.195 --> 01:42:44.186
You even took pictures of it.

01:42:44.330 --> 01:42:45.456
It was Evelyn Mulwray,

01:42:45.565 --> 01:42:48.796
and she's been paying you off
like a slot machine ever since.

01:42:48.902 --> 01:42:51.666
- You accusing me of extortion?
- Absolutely.

01:42:51.771 --> 01:42:53.466
I don't think I need a day or two.

01:42:53.573 --> 01:42:55.700
You're dumber than you think
I think you are.

01:42:55.842 --> 01:42:58.834
Not only that, but I wouldn't extort
a nickel from my worst enemy, Escobar.

01:42:58.945 --> 01:43:00.537
That's where I draw the line.

01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:02.807
I want the rest of the pictures, Gittes.

01:43:02.916 --> 01:43:04.645
We're talking about accessory
after the fact,

01:43:04.751 --> 01:43:06.412
conspiracy, and extortion, minimum.

01:43:06.553 --> 01:43:08.987
What do you think, Evelyn Mulwray
knocked off her husband in the ocean,

01:43:09.088 --> 01:43:10.385
then dragged him up to a reservoir

01:43:10.523 --> 01:43:13.321
because she thought
it would look more like an accident?

01:43:14.761 --> 01:43:16.058
Mulwray was murdered and moved

01:43:16.196 --> 01:43:19.893
because somebody didn't want his body
found in the ocean.

01:43:20.033 --> 01:43:21.022
Why is that?

01:43:21.134 --> 01:43:23.068
He found out
they were dumping water there.

01:43:23.203 --> 01:43:26.104
That's what they were trying to cover up.

01:43:27.073 --> 01:43:31.009
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Come on. I'll show you.

01:43:32.245 --> 01:43:35.442
Come on, Lou. You're in charge.
Make a decision.

01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:55.295
- It's too late.
- Too late for what?

01:43:55.435 --> 01:43:57.960
They only dump the water at night.

01:43:59.739 --> 01:44:02.708
- Reach anybody?
- Yelburton. He's the new chief.

01:44:02.809 --> 01:44:05.539
- Yeah, I know who he is. Go on!
- He says...

01:44:05.645 --> 01:44:07.977
- I know what he says.
- Shut up.

01:44:09.515 --> 01:44:10.573
Go on!

01:44:10.683 --> 01:44:12.548
Yelburton says there's irrigation
in the Valley,

01:44:12.652 --> 01:44:14.813
and there's always a little run-off
after they do that.

01:44:14.954 --> 01:44:16.444
And he says Gittes knows this,

01:44:16.589 --> 01:44:21.049
and he's been going around making
irresponsible accusations all last week.

01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:22.821
Lou, let's swear out a warrant
for her arrest.

01:44:22.962 --> 01:44:24.759
What the hell are we waiting for?

01:44:24.864 --> 01:44:29.460
He just made lieutenant.
Wants to hang on to his little gold bar.

01:44:33.306 --> 01:44:35.740
Have your client in my office
in two hours.

01:44:35.842 --> 01:44:38.333
And remember,
I don't have to let you go.

01:44:38.478 --> 01:44:41.504
I've got you right now
for withholding evidence.

01:44:42.715 --> 01:44:43.943
Loach?

01:45:29.595 --> 01:45:31.460
Where's Mrs. Mulwray?

01:45:33.199 --> 01:45:34.791
These her bags?

01:45:37.437 --> 01:45:39.405
Is she going on a trip?

01:45:40.206 --> 01:45:43.073
What are you doing?
What's going on here?

01:45:43.209 --> 01:45:46.576
- ls she going on a vacation?
- Mrs. Mulwray no home.

01:45:47.013 --> 01:45:51.040
"Mrs. Mulwray no home."
Well, I'll just have a look around, huh?

01:45:58.224 --> 01:46:00.158
Yeah, yeah. Bad for the glass.

01:46:00.259 --> 01:46:02.557
Oh, yes. Bad for glass.

01:46:03.096 --> 01:46:05.394
Salt water very bad for glass.

01:46:21.214 --> 01:46:22.545
Salt water?

01:46:23.249 --> 01:46:26.013
Very, very bad. See?

01:46:34.927 --> 01:46:36.360
What's that?

01:46:38.131 --> 01:46:39.564
Right there.

01:46:43.436 --> 01:46:44.596
There.

01:47:42.395 --> 01:47:44.260
- You wait.
- You wait.

01:47:49.869 --> 01:47:52.099
How are you? I've been calling you.

01:47:52.205 --> 01:47:53.638
- Yeah?
- It's all right, Kahn.

01:47:53.739 --> 01:47:55.866
- Have you slept?
- Sure.

01:47:57.043 --> 01:47:59.375
Have you had lunch?
Kahn can fix you something.

01:47:59.512 --> 01:48:02.675
- Where's the girl?
- Upstairs. Why?

01:48:02.815 --> 01:48:04.510
I want to see her.

01:48:04.917 --> 01:48:08.853
She's having a bath right now.
Why do you want to see her?

01:48:08.988 --> 01:48:10.615
Going someplace?

01:48:11.591 --> 01:48:14.321
Yes. We have a 5:30 train to catch.

01:48:18.164 --> 01:48:19.358
Jake?

01:48:28.941 --> 01:48:31.501
J. J. Gittes for Lieutenant Escobar.

01:48:31.911 --> 01:48:34.641
But... Now look, what's the matter?
What's wrong?

01:48:34.747 --> 01:48:38.843
- I told you, we have a 5:30...
- You're going to miss your train.

01:48:39.352 --> 01:48:40.546
Lieutenant Escobar.

01:48:40.686 --> 01:48:41.744
- Lou?
- Yeah.

01:48:41.888 --> 01:48:44.584
Meet me at 1972 Canyon Drive.

01:48:46.392 --> 01:48:48.383
Yeah. Soon as you can.

01:48:49.362 --> 01:48:51.193
Why did you do that?

01:48:51.631 --> 01:48:54.498
- You know any good criminal lawyers?
- No.

01:48:56.402 --> 01:48:59.166
Don't worry, I can recommend a couple.

01:48:59.739 --> 01:49:02.674
They're expensive, but you can afford it.

01:49:03.476 --> 01:49:06.673
Will you please tell me
what this is all about?

01:49:18.658 --> 01:49:21.627
I found these in your backyard
in the pond.

01:49:22.762 --> 01:49:25.458
They belonged to your husband,
didn't they?

01:49:25.598 --> 01:49:27.065
Didn't they?

01:49:27.967 --> 01:49:31.232
- I don't know. Yes, probably.
- Yes, positively.

01:49:31.337 --> 01:49:33.396
It's where he was drowned.

01:49:33.639 --> 01:49:34.628
What?

01:49:34.774 --> 01:49:37.368
There's no time
to be shocked by the truth.

01:49:37.476 --> 01:49:38.943
The coroner's report proves

01:49:39.078 --> 01:49:41.410
that he had salt water in his lungs
when he was killed.

01:49:41.514 --> 01:49:42.879
Just take my word for it, all right?

01:49:42.982 --> 01:49:45.041
Now, I want to know how it happened,
and I want to know why,

01:49:45.151 --> 01:49:47.142
and I want to know
before Escobar gets here,

01:49:47.286 --> 01:49:49.220
because I don't want to lose my license.

01:49:49.322 --> 01:49:53.383
I don't know what you are talking about.
This is the craziest, most insane thing...

01:49:53.492 --> 01:49:54.959
Stop it!

01:49:55.094 --> 01:49:56.789
I'm gonna make it easy for you.

01:49:56.929 --> 01:49:59.625
You were jealous. You had a fight.
He fell. He hit his head.

01:49:59.765 --> 01:50:00.789
It was an accident!

01:50:00.933 --> 01:50:03.561
But his girl is a witness.
So you had to shut her up.

01:50:03.669 --> 01:50:04.795
You don't have the guts to harm her,

01:50:04.937 --> 01:50:06.768
but you got the money
to keep her mouth shut.

01:50:06.872 --> 01:50:08.464
- Yes or no?
- No!

01:50:09.775 --> 01:50:12.141
Who is she? And don't give me
that crap about your sister,

01:50:12.278 --> 01:50:14.303
because you don't have a sister.

01:50:14.447 --> 01:50:16.074
I'll tell you...

01:50:16.482 --> 01:50:18.507
I'll tell you the truth.

01:50:20.453 --> 01:50:22.284
Good. What's her name?

01:50:24.190 --> 01:50:26.920
- Katherine.
- Katherine who?

01:50:29.395 --> 01:50:31.158
She's my daughter.

01:50:32.365 --> 01:50:34.333
I said I want the truth!

01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:36.595
She's my sister.

01:50:38.037 --> 01:50:39.698
She's my daughter.

01:50:40.740 --> 01:50:42.708
My sister, my daughter!

01:50:43.576 --> 01:50:45.339
I said I want the truth!

01:50:45.478 --> 01:50:46.809
All of it!

01:50:49.081 --> 01:50:51.845
She's my sister and my daughter!

01:50:55.821 --> 01:50:57.686
Kahn, please, go back.

01:50:58.257 --> 01:51:00.623
For God's sake, keep her upstairs.
Go back!

01:51:08.267 --> 01:51:09.996
My father and l...

01:51:14.607 --> 01:51:15.972
Understand?

01:51:16.909 --> 01:51:19.002
Or is it too tough for you?

01:51:28.187 --> 01:51:29.654
He raped you?

01:51:46.305 --> 01:51:48.000
Then what happened?

01:51:48.307 --> 01:51:49.706
I ran away.

01:51:50.076 --> 01:51:51.475
T o Mexico.

01:51:58.017 --> 01:52:01.350
Hollis came and took care of me.

01:52:04.457 --> 01:52:06.254
I couldn't see her.

01:52:07.460 --> 01:52:08.859
I was 15.

01:52:12.565 --> 01:52:14.499
I wanted to, but l...

01:52:15.801 --> 01:52:17.166
I couldn't.

01:52:19.772 --> 01:52:20.966
Then...

01:52:23.709 --> 01:52:25.836
Now I want to be with her.

01:52:26.645 --> 01:52:28.772
I want to take care of her.

01:52:29.148 --> 01:52:31.309
Where are you going to take her now?

01:52:31.450 --> 01:52:33.008
Back to Mexico.

01:52:34.353 --> 01:52:39.086
Well, you can't take the train. Escobar
will be looking for you everywhere.

01:52:41.494 --> 01:52:46.397
Well, how about a plane?

01:52:46.499 --> 01:52:47.659
No, that's worse.

01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:51.133
You better just get out of here.
Leave all this stuff here.

01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:55.104
Where does Kahn live?
Get the exact address.

01:52:55.975 --> 01:52:57.306
All right.

01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:04.313
Those didn't belong to Hollis.

01:53:04.784 --> 01:53:06.411
How do you know?

01:53:06.786 --> 01:53:08.777
He didn't wear bifocals.

01:53:40.319 --> 01:53:44.050
Katherine, say hello to Mr. Gittes.

01:53:44.323 --> 01:53:45.517
Hello.

01:53:46.492 --> 01:53:47.618
Hello.

01:53:52.665 --> 01:53:56.157
He lives at 1712 Alameda.
Do you know where that is?

01:53:59.238 --> 01:54:00.364
Sure.

01:54:21.427 --> 01:54:23.224
J. J. Gittes and Associates.

01:54:23.362 --> 01:54:26.160
- Sophie, get me Walsh.
- Yes, Mr. Gittes.

01:54:27.266 --> 01:54:28.824
- Jake?
- Yeah.

01:54:28.934 --> 01:54:32.529
Listen, pal, Escobar's going to try
and book me in about five minutes.

01:54:32.638 --> 01:54:34.162
What? What the hell's the matter?
What...

01:54:34.273 --> 01:54:36.241
Relax and I'll tell you.

01:54:36.375 --> 01:54:38.502
Wait in the office for me
about two hours.

01:54:38.611 --> 01:54:43.139
If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy
meet me at 1712 Alameda.

01:54:44.016 --> 01:54:46.883
Jesus. That's in Chinatown, ain't it?

01:54:47.019 --> 01:54:48.919
I know where it is. Just do it.

01:54:49.054 --> 01:54:51.079
1712 Alameda...

01:55:19.885 --> 01:55:21.512
Come on in, Lou.

01:55:22.821 --> 01:55:26.655
Looks like we're both too late.
She flew the coop.

01:55:31.997 --> 01:55:35.296
I don't suppose you have any idea
where she went.

01:55:35.401 --> 01:55:38.165
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- Where?

01:55:38.304 --> 01:55:41.137
Her maid's house.
I think she knows something's up.

01:55:41.240 --> 01:55:43.367
What's the maid's address?

01:55:43.876 --> 01:55:45.776
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down.

01:55:45.878 --> 01:55:48.847
No, no, no, Gittes.
You're going to show us.

01:55:49.648 --> 01:55:50.945
What for?

01:55:51.750 --> 01:55:53.843
Because if she ain't there,
you're going downtown,

01:55:53.986 --> 01:55:57.149
and you're gonna stay there
until she does show up.

01:55:57.823 --> 01:56:00.417
Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.

01:56:01.827 --> 01:56:04.694
Tell us about it
on the way to San Pedro.

01:56:17.943 --> 01:56:21.674
- Let's get the little lady.
- Lou, can I ask you a favor?

01:56:22.214 --> 01:56:24.944
I'd like to bring her out myself.

01:56:25.050 --> 01:56:28.577
She's not armed or nothing.
She won't be a problem.

01:56:28.687 --> 01:56:32.589
I just want a minute alone with her.
It would mean a lot to her.

01:56:32.691 --> 01:56:34.022
And to me.

01:56:38.697 --> 01:56:41.063
You never learn, do you, Jake?

01:56:42.768 --> 01:56:44.235
I guess not.

01:56:47.172 --> 01:56:48.730
Okay. But...

01:56:50.676 --> 01:56:52.735
I'll give you three minutes.

01:56:52.845 --> 01:56:54.335
Just three minutes.

01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:56.175
Gee, thanks, Lou.

01:57:12.297 --> 01:57:13.457
Yes?

01:57:14.667 --> 01:57:15.793
Hello.

01:57:16.802 --> 01:57:20.238
Mr. Gittes! Come in!
Well, this is some surprise, Mr. Gittes.

01:57:20.339 --> 01:57:22.170
Call me Jake. How you doing, Curly?

01:57:22.307 --> 01:57:24.275
Just sitting down for supper.
You care to join us?

01:57:24.376 --> 01:57:25.570
No, thanks.

01:57:25.678 --> 01:57:27.441
How about a glass of wine?

01:57:27.546 --> 01:57:30.174
- Hey, honey, this is the fellow that...
- I know.

01:57:30.315 --> 01:57:33.614
No, thank you, Curly, very much,
but I would like a glass of water, though.

01:57:33.752 --> 01:57:35.652
Come on out in the kitchen with me
for a second, huh?

01:57:35.788 --> 01:57:37.119
Sure thing.

01:57:41.193 --> 01:57:43.093
- Curly, where's your car?
- ln the garage.

01:57:43.195 --> 01:57:45.390
- Where's that?
- Off the alley.

01:57:45.497 --> 01:57:48.091
- Can you give me a ride somewhere?
- Sure, soon as we eat.

01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:50.566
Right now, Curly. It can't wait.

01:57:51.003 --> 01:57:53.904
- I'll tell my wife.
- T ell her later, Curl, huh?

01:58:25.971 --> 01:58:28.963
Just drive slow for a block or two,
will you, Curly?

01:58:29.108 --> 01:58:33.477
- What's this all about?
- I'll tell you in a block or two.

01:58:34.813 --> 01:58:36.542
How much do you owe me?

01:58:36.648 --> 01:58:39.617
Gee, Mr. Gittes,
we're going out tomorrow.

01:58:39.752 --> 01:58:43.449
I know you been real good about it,
but my cousin Auggie's sick.

01:58:43.589 --> 01:58:45.420
Forget it.
How would you like to pay me off

01:58:45.524 --> 01:58:48.652
by taking a couple of passengers
to Ensenada?

01:58:48.794 --> 01:58:52.252
- You'd have to leave tonight.
- I don't know.

01:58:52.364 --> 01:58:56.664
I might be able to squeeze 75 bucks
out of it for you.

01:58:57.536 --> 01:58:59.060
Maybe even 100.

01:59:00.572 --> 01:59:03.473
- Plus what I owe?
- I'll throw that in, too.

01:59:04.676 --> 01:59:08.237
1712 Alameda. It's in Chinatown.
Wait for me until 8:30.

01:59:08.347 --> 01:59:11.316
If I don't show up,
take them to your boat.

01:59:24.429 --> 01:59:26.329
You sure this is okay?

01:59:27.166 --> 01:59:30.602
Curly, you know how long
I've been in this business?

01:59:57.963 --> 02:00:02.059
Have you got your checkbook handy,
Mr. Cross? I've got the girl.

02:00:03.168 --> 02:00:05.363
You've got her? Where?

02:00:05.470 --> 02:00:07.563
Do you remember
the figures we discussed?

02:00:07.673 --> 02:00:09.800
Of course I do. Where are you?

02:00:09.942 --> 02:00:13.275
At your daughter's house.
How soon can you get here?

02:00:13.412 --> 02:00:14.640
An hour.

02:00:38.570 --> 02:00:40.435
Oh, there you are.

02:00:40.572 --> 02:00:44.941
Well, you don't look too much the worse
for wear, Mr. Gitts, I must say.

02:00:45.777 --> 02:00:47.768
- Where's the girl?
- I've got her.

02:00:47.913 --> 02:00:50.143
- ls she all right?
- She's fine.

02:00:50.816 --> 02:00:52.579
Well, where is she?

02:00:53.151 --> 02:00:54.846
With her mother.

02:00:56.622 --> 02:00:59.750
I got something
I'd like to show you, Mr. Cross.

02:00:59.892 --> 02:01:01.018
What is it?

02:01:01.126 --> 02:01:04.755
An obituary column.
Can you see all right in this light?

02:01:05.097 --> 02:01:06.587
I guess I can manage.

02:01:16.408 --> 02:01:17.966
What does it mean?

02:01:18.110 --> 02:01:20.442
That you killed Hollis Mulwray.

02:01:21.446 --> 02:01:22.845
Right here,

02:01:23.148 --> 02:01:24.672
in that pond.

02:01:25.384 --> 02:01:27.011
You drowned him.

02:01:28.287 --> 02:01:30.050
And you left these.

02:01:32.291 --> 02:01:36.387
The coroner's report shows Mulwray
had salt water in his lungs.

02:01:39.965 --> 02:01:44.129
Hollis was always fascinated
by tide pools.

02:01:45.170 --> 02:01:47.195
You know what he used to say?

02:01:47.306 --> 02:01:48.864
I haven't the faintest idea.

02:01:48.974 --> 02:01:51.033
"That's where life begins."

02:01:51.143 --> 02:01:53.008
Sloughs, tide pools.

02:01:54.646 --> 02:01:55.704
When we first come out here,

02:01:55.814 --> 02:01:58.578
he figured if you dumped water
into desert sand

02:01:58.684 --> 02:02:02.620
and let it percolate down to the bedrock,
it would stay there

02:02:02.754 --> 02:02:05.780
instead of evaporate
the way it does in most reservoirs.

02:02:05.924 --> 02:02:09.553
You'd only lose 20% instead of 70 or 80.
He made this city.

02:02:09.661 --> 02:02:11.458
And that's what you were going to do
in the Valley.

02:02:11.596 --> 02:02:12.927
It's what I am doing.

02:02:13.298 --> 02:02:14.925
When the bond issue passes Tuesday,

02:02:15.067 --> 02:02:17.297
there'll be $8 million
to build an aqueduct and a reservoir.

02:02:17.436 --> 02:02:18.869
I'm doing it.

02:02:18.971 --> 02:02:20.529
Gonna be a lot of irate citizens

02:02:20.639 --> 02:02:23.904
when they find out that they're paying
for water that they're not gonna get.

02:02:24.009 --> 02:02:25.977
Oh, that's all taken care of.

02:02:26.111 --> 02:02:30.138
See, Mr. Gitts,
either you bring the water to L. A.,

02:02:30.282 --> 02:02:32.580
or you bring L. A. to the water.

02:02:33.251 --> 02:02:34.309
How are you gonna do that?

02:02:34.453 --> 02:02:38.253
By incorporating the Valley into the city.
Simple as that.

02:02:39.992 --> 02:02:42.153
- How much are you worth?
- I have no idea.

02:02:42.294 --> 02:02:43.386
How much do you want?

02:02:43.495 --> 02:02:45.963
No, I just want to know
what you're worth. Over $10 million?

02:02:46.098 --> 02:02:49.090
- Oh my, yes.
- Why are you doing it?

02:02:49.201 --> 02:02:50.293
How much better can you eat?

02:02:50.435 --> 02:02:52.630
What can you buy
that you can't already afford?

02:02:52.771 --> 02:02:54.602
The future, Mr. Gitts!

02:02:55.107 --> 02:02:56.472
The future!

02:02:57.309 --> 02:02:59.140
Now, where's the girl?

02:02:59.277 --> 02:03:01.575
I want the only daughter I've got left.

02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:04.843
As you found out,
Evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.

02:03:04.983 --> 02:03:07.315
Who do you blame for that? Her?

02:03:07.886 --> 02:03:09.683
I don't blame myself.

02:03:11.023 --> 02:03:14.288
See, Mr. Gitts, most people
never have to face the fact

02:03:14.393 --> 02:03:16.953
that at the right time and the right place,

02:03:17.062 --> 02:03:19.257
they're capable of anything.

02:03:21.466 --> 02:03:24.697
Claude, take those glasses from him,
will you?

02:03:31.910 --> 02:03:34.174
It's not worth it, Mr. Gitts.

02:03:36.181 --> 02:03:38.206
It's really not worth it.

02:03:44.856 --> 02:03:45.823
Where's the girl?

02:04:41.012 --> 02:04:44.106
You remember "Night Train"
Claude Mulvihill, don't you, boys?

02:04:44.249 --> 02:04:47.741
Mr. Cross, these are my associates,
Mr. Walsh and Mr...

02:04:49.020 --> 02:04:51.147
You're under arrest, Jake.

02:04:53.291 --> 02:04:54.383
Good news.

02:04:54.493 --> 02:04:58.122
Withholding evidence, extortion,
accessory after the fact.

02:04:58.263 --> 02:05:00.561
I didn't extort nothing from nobody, Lou.

02:05:00.665 --> 02:05:03.964
This is Noah Cross, if you don't know.
Evelyn's father, if you don't know.

02:05:04.102 --> 02:05:06.263
He's the bird you're after, Lou.
I can explain everything.

02:05:06.371 --> 02:05:07.429
- Lieutenant?
- Just give me five minutes.

02:05:07.539 --> 02:05:08.597
That's all I need.

02:05:08.707 --> 02:05:10.834
- He's rich! Do you understand?
- Shut up!

02:05:10.976 --> 02:05:13.103
He thinks he can get away
with anything!

02:05:13.211 --> 02:05:15.441
Shut up or I'm gonna lock you in
to the wheel of that car.

02:05:15.547 --> 02:05:19.278
Lieutenant, I am rich, I am Noah Cross.

02:05:19.985 --> 02:05:22.419
- Evelyn Mulwray is my daughter.
- He's crazy, Lou!

02:05:22.521 --> 02:05:24.182
He killed Mulwray because
of the water thing!

02:05:24.322 --> 02:05:25.311
- I'm telling...
- Water?

02:05:25.457 --> 02:05:26.515
Would you just listen to me
for five minutes?

02:05:26.658 --> 02:05:29.422
Loach, lock him to the wheel of that car.

02:05:30.395 --> 02:05:33.262
Lou, you don't know
what's going on here. I'm telling you.

02:05:33.365 --> 02:05:34.764
Katherine!

02:05:34.966 --> 02:05:36.126
Katherine.

02:05:36.234 --> 02:05:41.103
- I am your grandfather, my dear.
- Come, miss.

02:05:41.206 --> 02:05:42.833
- I'm your grandfather.
- Come, miss.

02:05:42.974 --> 02:05:44.635
Katherine, get in the car.

02:05:44.743 --> 02:05:46.108
- Go on, go on.
- But, ma'am...

02:05:46.211 --> 02:05:49.339
No, no, go back to the Hong Kong.
I'll follow. It's all right.

02:05:50.215 --> 02:05:52.206
Get away from her. Get away!

02:05:52.350 --> 02:05:57.151
Evelyn. Please, please, be reasonable.

02:05:57.255 --> 02:05:59.655
- Come to my...
- Get away from her!

02:05:59.758 --> 02:06:01.020
Evelyn!

02:06:02.260 --> 02:06:05.127
How many years have I got?

02:06:05.730 --> 02:06:07.288
She's mine, too.

02:06:07.399 --> 02:06:09.799
She's never going to know that!

02:06:12.003 --> 02:06:16.201
Evelyn, you're a disturbed woman.
You cannot hope to provide.

02:06:16.341 --> 02:06:19.071
Evelyn, put that gun away!
Let the police handle this!

02:06:19.211 --> 02:06:21.008
He owns the police!

02:06:21.846 --> 02:06:23.370
Get away from her.

02:06:23.515 --> 02:06:26.678
- You'll have to kill me first.
- Get away! Get...

02:06:27.886 --> 02:06:29.979
Katherine, close the door.

02:06:30.855 --> 02:06:31.981
Halt!

02:07:12.497 --> 02:07:13.930
Oh, no!

02:07:14.032 --> 02:07:16.728
Better call the captain.
Get an ambulance.

02:07:16.835 --> 02:07:18.803
- No!
- Turn him loose. Turn them all loose.

02:07:18.937 --> 02:07:20.461
- Lord.
- No!

02:07:24.109 --> 02:07:25.337
Lord.

02:07:25.810 --> 02:07:27.141
Lord.

02:07:28.780 --> 02:07:30.247
No! No!

02:07:32.050 --> 02:07:35.781
- No! No! No! No! No!
- Don't look. Don't look. Don't look.

02:07:48.400 --> 02:07:51.028
- As little as possible.
- What's that?

02:07:54.339 --> 02:07:55.806
What's that?

02:08:00.345 --> 02:08:03.212
You want to do your partner
a big favor?

02:08:04.883 --> 02:08:06.373
T ake him home.

02:08:10.021 --> 02:08:11.545
T ake him home!

02:08:11.856 --> 02:08:14.347
Just get him the hell out of here!

02:08:14.492 --> 02:08:15.982
Come on, Jake.

02:08:17.062 --> 02:08:18.552
Go home, Jake.

02:08:19.597 --> 02:08:21.622
I'm doing you a favor.

02:08:23.201 --> 02:08:24.725
Come on, Jake.

02:08:27.872 --> 02:08:30.238
Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.

02:08:45.123 --> 02:08:48.957
All right, come on. Clear the area!
On the sidewalk!

02:08:50.995 --> 02:08:52.690
On the sidewalk!
