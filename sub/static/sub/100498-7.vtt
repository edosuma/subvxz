WEBVTT

00:12.762 --> 00:16.599
JIMMY: And anything that already happened,
we're not going back over all that.

00:16.683 --> 00:19.728
Let's just focus on from here on out.

00:19.811 --> 00:21.563
Right. Past is past.

00:21.646 --> 00:23.732
And moving forward...

00:23.815 --> 00:26.151
If I have the urge to not tell you something,

00:26.234 --> 00:27.485
then I've gotta tell you.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.320
Right. Full disclosure.

00:29.404 --> 00:30.780
And it works both ways.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.240
Works both ways.

00:35.952 --> 00:39.080
And mute.

00:39.164 --> 00:44.169
Okay, what if I have the urge
to not tell you something, but I tell you,

00:44.252 --> 00:46.504
and you don't like what you hear?

00:47.505 --> 00:49.716
I just wanna know what's going on.

00:51.050 --> 00:52.427
-Yeah, but...
-Jimmy.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.513
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

01:02.103 --> 01:03.063
There he is.

01:06.691 --> 01:09.694
So we're really doing this, huh?

01:09.778 --> 01:11.488
Yeah, it looks that way.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.366
-Am I late?
JIMMY: Nope.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.243
Cool. Good morning.

01:17.327 --> 01:19.162
-Thanks for coming.
-Good to see you.

01:19.245 --> 01:20.830
-Shall we?
-Yeah.

01:32.300 --> 01:33.676
Psst.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.015
Psst.

01:43.645 --> 01:45.104
What's up?

01:45.188 --> 01:47.232
Want me to hold the rings for you?

01:47.315 --> 01:49.609
Oh, there's no rings.

01:49.692 --> 01:52.570
Well, I can fix that easy.
I seen a clerk downstairs,

01:52.654 --> 01:54.322
had a nice rock.

01:54.405 --> 01:55.949
Probably about a half a karat.

01:56.032 --> 01:57.575
Huell, no, I...

01:58.576 --> 02:00.370
This is a different kind of thing.

02:02.163 --> 02:04.707
Oh, it's like that.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.961
Then we should do the right thing for the rugrat.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.255
No, there's no rugrat.

02:12.257 --> 02:14.509
Well, you at least gonna
take her somewhere after this.

02:14.592 --> 02:16.344
Little honeymoon?

02:16.427 --> 02:21.432
I got a friend who runs a B&B in Roswell,
get you a good deal.

02:21.516 --> 02:26.062
How about we take a raincheck on that?
We just need to get this done. Feel me?

02:27.689 --> 02:30.316
This is a legal arrangement.

02:30.400 --> 02:34.946
This way, if I get into trouble,
they can't make her testify against me.

02:36.197 --> 02:37.949
You getting hitched for that?

02:38.950 --> 02:40.076
Yeah.

02:41.077 --> 02:45.498
Yeah. That's all this is. You got it?

02:46.666 --> 02:49.794
Is she gonna be a McGill or Goodman?

02:49.878 --> 02:53.214
Wexler. I-- I gotta go finish this.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.134
Here you go.

02:57.802 --> 02:59.178
KIM:
Thanks.

02:59.262 --> 03:02.724
Sir, do you have documentation
of your two previous dissolutions?

03:02.807 --> 03:03.975
Yeah.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.108
Great. One sec.

03:27.373 --> 03:28.708
This okay with you?

03:30.084 --> 03:31.252
Of course.

03:32.253 --> 03:35.340
Yeah. I just mean, uh...

03:36.591 --> 03:40.136
this might not be what you dreamed of
when you were 12.

03:41.679 --> 03:45.850
Jimmy, it's not about that.
This is just, you know...

03:47.393 --> 03:48.728
everything we talked about.

03:48.811 --> 03:50.396
Right. Right. I know.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.066
Just making sure.

03:54.609 --> 03:57.487
CLERK:
All set. I just need 25 dollars.

03:57.570 --> 03:58.988
I got it.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.400
Sorry to keep you waiting.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.485
Been that kind of day.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.114
So...

04:42.365 --> 04:43.866
Wexler-McGill?

04:45.076 --> 04:46.452
Yes.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.372
-You picked the short vows, that right?
-Yes.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.750
And you have your witnesses.

04:52.834 --> 04:53.918
HUELL:
Mm-hm.

04:54.919 --> 04:56.671
OFFICIANT:
Okay, then.

04:56.754 --> 04:58.298
Here we go.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.428
Here we go.

05:03.511 --> 05:04.679
Oh.

05:08.141 --> 05:12.186
Do you, James Morgan McGill,
take Kimberly Wexler...

05:13.313 --> 05:15.565
Hmm. No middle name.

05:17.567 --> 05:21.154
...to be your lawfully wedded wife,
to have and to hold,

05:21.237 --> 05:23.114
from this day forward,

05:23.197 --> 05:25.158
for better, for worse,

05:25.241 --> 05:27.368
for richer, for poorer,

05:27.452 --> 05:31.539
in sickness and in health, till death do you part?

05:34.375 --> 05:35.668
I do.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.921
OFFICIANT:
And do you, Kimberly Wexler,

05:39.005 --> 05:40.882
take James Morgan McGill

05:40.965 --> 05:43.509
to be your lawfully wedded husband,

05:43.593 --> 05:46.929
to have and to hold, from this day forward,

05:47.013 --> 05:48.681
for better, for worse,

05:48.765 --> 05:51.059
for richer, for poorer,

05:51.142 --> 05:53.061
in sickness and in health,

05:53.144 --> 05:55.396
till death do you part?

05:59.150 --> 06:01.569
-I do.
OFFICIANT: Mm-hm.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.655
Do you have the rings?

06:04.739 --> 06:06.991
-We, um...
-We didn't do that.

06:07.992 --> 06:09.744
No rings.

06:09.827 --> 06:10.912
Okey-dokey.

06:12.288 --> 06:15.124
Then by the power vested in me
by the state of New Mexico,

06:15.208 --> 06:18.753
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

06:22.548 --> 06:24.300
You may kiss.

06:30.181 --> 06:31.599
Psst, psst.

06:31.682 --> 06:33.476
One more. One more.

07:01.879 --> 07:04.090
JIMMY:
So lunch is definitely out?

07:04.173 --> 07:06.259
Sorry, I just can't get away.

07:11.514 --> 07:14.016
But I'll be home early tonight.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.351
Me too.

07:24.861 --> 07:26.737
Saul Goodman, speedy justice for you.

07:26.821 --> 07:28.197
NACHO:
<i>I've been calling you.</i>

07:28.281 --> 07:30.241
Yeah, I had a busy morning.

07:30.324 --> 07:32.994
<i>Go to lockup. Your client's waiting for you.</i>

07:33.077 --> 07:34.370
My client? What--?

07:34.454 --> 07:36.289
Who got picked up this time?

07:36.372 --> 07:38.583
<i>Jorge De Guzman.</i>

07:38.666 --> 07:42.170
Who the hell is Jorge De Guzman?

07:42.253 --> 07:43.671
<i>Who do you think?</i>

08:12.492 --> 08:14.577
WOMAN:
<i>State v. Jorge De Guzman,</i>

08:14.660 --> 08:18.998
case CR2004003022.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.834
Mr. De Guzman.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.546
Murder in the first degree,

08:25.630 --> 08:28.841
robbery while armed with a deadly weapon,

08:28.925 --> 08:31.302
tampering with evidence, arson...

08:31.385 --> 08:35.973
Your Honor, uh, my client waives
the reading of the remaining charges.

08:36.057 --> 08:37.517
JUDGE:
How does he plead?

08:37.600 --> 08:40.144
Not guilty. On all charges.

08:41.145 --> 08:44.774
I'd like to schedule a pre-trial hearing in six weeks.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.776
And I'm going to deny bond.

08:46.859 --> 08:48.778
-Uh, Your Honor...
-That's my decision.

08:59.038 --> 09:01.958
RICH: Thank you for making time for us
on such short notice.

09:04.794 --> 09:07.588
We wanted to tell you, face-to-face,

09:07.672 --> 09:11.759
how much everyone in the firm regrets
what happened yesterday.

09:11.842 --> 09:15.179
The situation in Tucumcari spiraled out of control,

09:15.263 --> 09:17.181
and we take full responsibility.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.603
Kevin, you chose me as your attorney,

09:22.687 --> 09:26.649
and that was the best day of my professional life.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.695
Yesterday was the worst day
of my professional life.

09:31.696 --> 09:36.033
I can't tell you how much I regret
that I let you down.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.868
But I want you to know

09:37.952 --> 09:41.455
that if you choose
to move forward with me, and with us...

09:42.456 --> 09:44.792
nothing like that will ever happen again.

09:46.836 --> 09:49.880
No one's denying that things went off course,

09:49.964 --> 09:52.883
but let's keep in mind that over the last 18 months,

09:52.967 --> 09:54.802
we've opened 24 new branches.

09:54.885 --> 09:59.140
And until Tucumcari, the legal work has been...

10:00.141 --> 10:01.517
flawless.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.687
Well...

10:06.272 --> 10:08.524
Kim, you dropped the ball, that's for sure.

10:09.650 --> 10:12.862
And, heh, with all your smarts,

10:12.945 --> 10:15.948
whole office full of associates and fancy degrees...

10:17.575 --> 10:20.244
you get rolled over by...

10:21.912 --> 10:24.248
Well, you know what happened.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.961
I expected more.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.265
PAIGE:
Thanks for coming in.

10:45.227 --> 10:46.562
Thank you, Kevin.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.481
-Paige.
-Thank you.

10:48.564 --> 10:51.233
Kim, ahem, one more thing.

10:51.317 --> 10:55.863
This fellow, McGill, or Goodman, whatever...

10:58.324 --> 11:00.326
You could do a whole lot better.

11:11.879 --> 11:15.049
I'll say fifty-fifty. But we gave it a shot.

11:16.217 --> 11:19.678
-Rich, we can't leave it like this.
-Oh, he'll stew for a bit.

11:19.762 --> 11:22.640
-And then we'll see.
-And if he does stick with us?

11:22.723 --> 11:25.643
-Then what? We walk on eggshells forever?
-Mmm.

11:25.726 --> 11:27.520
What's our alternative?

11:36.987 --> 11:39.198
-We counted at seven, right?
-Yes, but after the survey...

11:41.075 --> 11:44.745
Uh, sorry to interrupt, but do you mind
if we take just another minute of your time?

11:47.373 --> 11:48.541
I guess.

11:52.253 --> 11:56.882
Kevin, no matter what our relationship
looks like moving forward,

11:57.925 --> 11:59.343
we owe you the truth.

12:01.595 --> 12:03.973
And the truth is,

12:04.056 --> 12:06.350
you ignored our advice.

12:09.270 --> 12:11.355
Oh, so this is my fault?

12:11.439 --> 12:14.984
KIM: We said Mesa Verde should reconsider
the site for the call center.

12:15.067 --> 12:17.153
You declined.

12:17.236 --> 12:20.865
We advised you to keep the purchase lot
as an investment.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.241
You declined.

12:22.324 --> 12:25.244
And we advised you to leave that meeting
when it became apparent

12:25.327 --> 12:27.621
that the other side was negotiating in bad faith.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.123
You declined.

12:29.206 --> 12:32.501
At every point,
we gave you the best guidance we could,

12:32.585 --> 12:35.463
and at every point, you chose to go your own way.

12:36.630 --> 12:40.384
We are your attorneys,
and it is our job to advise you.

12:40.468 --> 12:43.012
The decisions will always be yours,

12:43.095 --> 12:46.056
but if you continue to ignore us...

12:47.808 --> 12:50.227
then this is the wrong relationship.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.735
And, Kevin, I have to tell you,

12:57.818 --> 13:00.488
whoever represents you in the future...

13:02.072 --> 13:04.783
I hope you're gonna listen to them a little bit better.

13:07.411 --> 13:08.579
That it?

13:14.793 --> 13:16.295
All right, then.

13:16.378 --> 13:18.047
See you on Thursday.

13:20.883 --> 13:22.343
Okay.

13:26.972 --> 13:29.058
Well, uh...

13:29.141 --> 13:30.559
I guess we'll get out of your hair.

13:31.560 --> 13:32.853
Thursday.

13:45.199 --> 13:48.285
"JMM." What's that?

13:50.120 --> 13:53.332
-Oh, that's my motto.
-Yeah?

13:54.500 --> 13:57.044
"Justice Matters Most."

14:01.215 --> 14:04.802
Okay, brass tacks. Um...
How solid is this "De Guzman" thing?

14:04.885 --> 14:07.137
Because if they find out
you're not who they think you are,

14:07.221 --> 14:09.306
-that could be a little--
-It's not gonna be a problem.

14:09.390 --> 14:10.766
Great.

14:10.849 --> 14:14.937
Um, first up, we gotta get the murder rap
down to manslaughter.

14:15.020 --> 14:19.108
Now I think that the DA's primed to cut a deal,

14:19.191 --> 14:22.278
so I say, make them come to us, power move...

14:22.361 --> 14:24.029
-No.
-No?

14:25.489 --> 14:28.117
Nope. No deal.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.954
-Here's the thing about going to trial...
-No, no, no.

14:32.037 --> 14:34.748
No trial. No deal.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.335
Okay, yeah, sure, it's just...

14:38.419 --> 14:41.088
Well, what did you have in mind?

14:41.171 --> 14:44.091
-You're gonna get me out on bail.
-Bail?

14:44.174 --> 14:45.634
That's...

14:47.011 --> 14:47.970
Well, the thing there...

14:48.053 --> 14:50.222
I mean, I don't know how things work
south of the border,

14:50.306 --> 14:53.392
but here, under these circumstances, uh,

14:53.475 --> 14:55.185
well, that's a long shot.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.066
I'm sorry, I don't, uh...

15:06.155 --> 15:08.490
You wanna be a friend of the cartel?

15:09.742 --> 15:10.576
Hmm?

15:11.577 --> 15:13.370
Time to get yourself a new motto.

15:14.872 --> 15:15.956
Just.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.458
Make.

15:17.541 --> 15:18.542
Money.

15:26.842 --> 15:30.679
MIKE: "'But what does that mean, 'ephemeral'?
repeated the Little Prince,

15:30.763 --> 15:35.351
who never in his life let go of a question
once he had asked it.

15:35.434 --> 15:36.685
'It means,

15:36.769 --> 15:41.065
which is in danger of speedy disappearance.'

15:41.148 --> 15:45.194
'Is my flower in danger of speedy disappearance?'

15:45.277 --> 15:47.905
'It certainly is.'"

15:50.032 --> 15:51.283
Hmm.

15:51.367 --> 15:54.620
Okay, kid, we'll finish the rest later.

15:54.703 --> 15:56.413
Now, good night.

15:56.497 --> 15:58.540
Not yet, Pop-Pop.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.709
Just two more pages?

16:01.710 --> 16:04.171
Two more pages, that's it.

16:04.254 --> 16:05.965
All right, now lie down.

16:11.178 --> 16:15.307
"'My flower is ephemeral,'
the Little Prince said to himself,

16:15.391 --> 16:20.187
'and she only has four thorns
to defend herself against the world...'"

16:28.737 --> 16:29.947
She's out.

16:30.948 --> 16:33.659
I think <i>The Little Prince</i> did the trick.

16:33.742 --> 16:36.412
I think you wore her out with all that hide-and-seek.

16:36.495 --> 16:39.790
I don't know, I think maybe she wore me out.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.254
This girl at work,

16:45.337 --> 16:47.715
she can't get her son to sleep.

16:47.798 --> 16:51.760
The kid's 2 years old and he's still tearing
around the house at midnight.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.178
MIKE:
Hmm.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.432
Matty was like that.

16:57.516 --> 16:58.434
Really?

16:58.517 --> 16:59.768
Yeah. Really.

17:00.769 --> 17:03.022
Never wanted to conk out.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.815
Too busy.

17:07.943 --> 17:10.029
He was such a cutie.

17:11.530 --> 17:15.034
I love those pictures of him sitting on Santa's lap.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.995
-Oh, that face.
-Mm-hm.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.122
Cried his eyes out.

17:20.205 --> 17:21.457
Every year.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.710
And every year, he'd wanna try it again.

17:30.966 --> 17:32.676
I'm better now.

17:35.637 --> 17:37.473
What changed?

17:39.975 --> 17:42.978
Decided to play the cards I was dealt.

17:52.237 --> 17:55.908
Just decided he'll see us
at the regular Thursday meeting.

17:55.991 --> 17:57.576
You spoke truth to power.

17:57.659 --> 17:59.661
We'll see if he sticks to it.

17:59.745 --> 18:00.829
How'd your day go?

18:04.500 --> 18:06.085
I got married.

18:13.133 --> 18:14.259
Yeah.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.053
What?

18:46.333 --> 18:47.376
What?

18:48.377 --> 18:51.130
I'm having the urge not to tell you something.

18:52.589 --> 18:55.259
It's nothing. I'll-- I'll tell you later, okay?

18:56.760 --> 18:58.595
Jimmy, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

18:59.555 --> 19:00.806
What?

19:00.889 --> 19:02.057
Um...

19:02.891 --> 19:07.729
I have a new client. He's, uh, connected.

19:07.813 --> 19:12.025
I mean, he's a cartel guy. From Mexico.

19:12.109 --> 19:12.943
Pretty high up.

19:14.111 --> 19:17.781
Anyway, he's in for murder,
and he wants bail, which...

19:17.865 --> 19:18.949
That's impossible.

19:19.032 --> 19:20.325
I mean...

19:21.326 --> 19:23.704
no way in hell this dude is ever seeing sunshine,

19:23.787 --> 19:29.042
but if I could, you know, somehow find a way...

19:30.294 --> 19:36.258
um, he said I'd be a friend of the cartel.

19:37.801 --> 19:39.553
"Friend of the cartel"?

19:42.556 --> 19:44.641
You know what that means?

19:45.767 --> 19:47.269
It means money.

19:48.770 --> 19:50.856
"Ranch in Montana" kind of money.

19:50.939 --> 19:53.901
Like, uh, "private jet" kind of money.

19:53.984 --> 19:57.237
Press conferences, TV news, the works.

19:59.531 --> 20:05.078
But do you want to be a friend of the cartel?

20:07.497 --> 20:08.498
No.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.000
No.

20:11.001 --> 20:12.669
Absolutely not, I...

20:13.712 --> 20:15.255
Anyway, it's a moot point.

20:15.339 --> 20:17.925
Because the guy is the definition of a flight risk.

20:18.008 --> 20:22.429
So, look, I'm gonna put up a fight, right?
Just for show.

20:24.389 --> 20:27.309
There's no judge on Earth
who's gonna grant him bail.

20:28.894 --> 20:31.647
I just-- I didn't wanna tell you.

20:31.730 --> 20:35.150
So I thought I should tell you.

20:46.203 --> 20:47.663
You know what?

20:47.746 --> 20:48.956
What?

20:56.463 --> 20:58.215
I'm glad you did.

20:59.508 --> 21:00.801
Oh?

21:45.262 --> 21:46.430
Hey.

21:46.513 --> 21:48.724
No, no, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

21:48.807 --> 21:51.018
So, what's happening with 6th Street?

21:52.102 --> 21:53.353
Mm-hm.

21:54.354 --> 21:55.772
And the take?

21:56.857 --> 21:57.983
Okay.

21:59.151 --> 22:02.070
So, what are you gonna do about it?
Are you gonna send in Ocho Loco?

22:04.364 --> 22:06.950
Oh. Even better. Nice.

22:07.951 --> 22:09.161
Listen.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.372
I got something for you to do.

22:30.390 --> 22:33.852
I'm not telling you shit until we talk about my dad.

22:35.270 --> 22:38.815
What you tell me
and when you say it is not up to you.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.817
Listen, you said, when Lalo's out of the picture,

22:40.901 --> 22:42.944
we'll talk about my father, right?

22:43.028 --> 22:44.571
Well, he's out of the picture.

22:47.574 --> 22:49.910
MIKE: Say your piece.
-I'm done.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.205
I want out.

22:53.288 --> 22:55.582
MIKE:
And you want me to square it with Fring.

22:55.665 --> 22:58.418
NACHO:
Fring's not all of it, it's the cartel.

22:58.502 --> 23:00.629
I disappear, they're gonna go after my father.

23:00.712 --> 23:02.130
He's gotta come with me.

23:02.214 --> 23:05.717
But no matter what I say,
with him, it's the cops or nothing.

23:05.801 --> 23:08.178
The cops won't solve this.

23:12.808 --> 23:14.351
You got a way?

23:16.853 --> 23:17.979
Hm.

23:19.940 --> 23:22.025
What are you holding out?

23:29.032 --> 23:31.201
Lalo called me from inside.

23:31.284 --> 23:33.203
He put me back in charge.

23:36.039 --> 23:37.374
And?

23:39.918 --> 23:41.128
And...

23:42.671 --> 23:45.590
he wants me to burn down Pollos Hermanos.

23:50.053 --> 23:52.472
Then he's not out of the picture, is he?

24:15.787 --> 24:17.289
CLEO:
The Avocado Mania promotion,

24:17.372 --> 24:21.626
which we've been testing in select franchises,
has been a smashing success,

24:21.710 --> 24:24.337
contributing to an 18 percent increase in foot traffic

24:24.421 --> 24:25.881
at participating locations

24:25.964 --> 24:29.259
and a 12 percent bump in customer satisfaction.

24:29.342 --> 24:30.969
We know a good thing when we see it.

24:31.052 --> 24:35.515
So we are planning
to fully roll out Avocado Mania in Q2.

24:35.599 --> 24:42.606
Additionally, our family fun remodel improved
the in-store Whiskerstay's experience,

24:42.689 --> 24:46.443
resulting in increased repeat business
system-wide.

24:46.526 --> 24:48.778
In fact, we are happy to share the news

24:48.862 --> 24:52.824
that the latest ACSI survey
now places Whiskerstay's

24:52.908 --> 24:57.704
in the top 10 percent
of limited-service chains nationwide.

24:59.748 --> 25:01.124
SCHULER:
Very nice, Cleo.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.043
Very nice. Thank you.

25:03.126 --> 25:08.715
And now, let's hear from Gustavo Fring
of Los Pollos Hermanos.

25:08.798 --> 25:11.259
-Thank you, Herr Schuler.
<i>-Bitte.</i>

25:11.343 --> 25:13.929
I am delighted to report that the last quarter,

25:14.012 --> 25:18.266
Los Pollos Hermanos revenues
have increased 8.3 percent.

25:18.350 --> 25:22.479
Comparable restaurant sales
increased by 4.2 percent.

25:22.562 --> 25:28.401
Representing the eighth consecutive quarter
of comparable sales increases.

25:30.320 --> 25:34.574
In addition to our continued focus
on our core menu,

25:34.658 --> 25:39.871
we are very proud to introduce a new offering

25:39.955 --> 25:42.165
that will extend our product line

25:42.249 --> 25:45.877
while celebrating
our traditional New Mexican culture.

25:45.961 --> 25:51.508
I invite you to taste our delicious Spice Curls.

25:52.759 --> 25:56.638
The curly fry with the Southwestern kick.

26:07.857 --> 26:09.317
MAN:
Here we are.

26:10.944 --> 26:13.822
The bathroom has heated floors.

26:14.823 --> 26:17.993
You'll find the dial just under the light switch.

26:18.076 --> 26:20.161
There's a steam shower.

26:21.788 --> 26:23.498
And bidet.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.752
This controls the drapes.

26:29.212 --> 26:31.006
Many of our guests have enjoyed the rodeo.

26:31.089 --> 26:34.384
It's in town tomorrow, Reliance Stadium.
I highly recommend it.

26:34.467 --> 26:37.262
Oh, thank you. I'm only staying the night.

26:37.345 --> 26:38.638
Next time, then.

26:39.639 --> 26:41.057
Is there anything else, sir?

26:41.141 --> 26:43.226
No. No, no, that will be all.

26:44.227 --> 26:46.021
Thank you very much.

26:50.900 --> 26:53.194
-Thank you, Mr. Fring.
-My pleasure.

28:22.492 --> 28:25.620
LYDIA: Peter. Look who's here.
-Hm? Oh?

28:26.329 --> 28:28.498
-Hello, my friend.
-Oh.

28:28.581 --> 28:29.999
Gustavo.

28:34.504 --> 28:37.715
Always good to see you, my friend.

28:37.799 --> 28:39.134
Oh, you look well.

28:39.217 --> 28:40.844
Well...

28:40.927 --> 28:42.554
I don't feel well.

28:46.057 --> 28:48.476
Maybe things will improve, now that you're here.

28:49.477 --> 28:53.606
Lydia tells me Salamanca is in jail.
This means you can continue construction?

28:57.277 --> 29:00.113
Eduardo Salamanca has been arrested
for murder.

29:00.196 --> 29:05.118
-Uh-huh.
-However, even from jail, he creates...

29:06.161 --> 29:07.036
issues.

29:08.079 --> 29:09.998
What kind of issues?

29:11.332 --> 29:14.085
He ordered his men
to burn down one of my restaurants.

29:15.587 --> 29:19.382
You're kidding. He's in jail. He can still do that?

29:19.466 --> 29:20.925
I'm afraid so.

29:21.926 --> 29:24.637
I know it's not exactly my area of expertise,

29:24.721 --> 29:27.807
but don't people get killed in prison all the time?

29:27.891 --> 29:31.478
I mean, shanked and shivved, and whatnot.

29:31.561 --> 29:34.606
Anything happens to Salamanca
on this side of the border,

29:34.689 --> 29:37.942
the cartel will assume that it was my doing.

29:38.026 --> 29:41.029
It would mean war.

29:41.112 --> 29:45.533
War for which we are unprepared.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.118
SCHULER:
My God.

29:47.202 --> 29:50.789
-This nightmare never ends.
-He's concerned about the money.

29:50.872 --> 29:56.211
Concerned?
Four million eight hundred thousand euros.

29:56.294 --> 29:58.379
It's a miracle I haven't been caught.

29:58.463 --> 30:01.633
Last year, the auditors came this close.

30:01.716 --> 30:05.011
One of them, a woman, I think she knew.

30:05.094 --> 30:07.013
-Peter...
-At first it was a year.

30:07.096 --> 30:09.307
Then it was two. Then, three.

30:09.390 --> 30:12.060
And now you're telling me, how long?

30:12.143 --> 30:14.646
I can't. I can't.

30:14.729 --> 30:17.148
-They will catch me. And then it is over.
GUS: Peter.

30:17.232 --> 30:18.608
-I can't.
-Peter.

30:18.691 --> 30:21.069
Gustavo, please. I can't.

30:21.152 --> 30:22.362
Listen to me.

30:22.445 --> 30:24.280
Listen to me.

30:27.408 --> 30:29.202
Do you remember Santiago?

30:31.204 --> 30:35.124
The two of us. Our backs to the wall.

30:35.208 --> 30:39.045
I will never forget what you did.

30:40.338 --> 30:43.925
You are still the same man.

30:45.718 --> 30:49.430
You will do what is necessary.

30:54.727 --> 30:56.896
You stay strong, my friend.

30:58.064 --> 31:00.024
We have come so far.

31:01.067 --> 31:03.444
We are so very close.

31:10.952 --> 31:12.328
Okay.

31:13.955 --> 31:14.789
Good.

31:15.790 --> 31:18.626
Now, you eat.

31:27.927 --> 31:30.847
LYDIA:
Tomorrow, you and I are going to the rodeo.

31:30.930 --> 31:32.724
SCHULER: The rodeo?
LYDIA: Yeah.

31:32.807 --> 31:34.392
To see the cowboys.

31:34.475 --> 31:36.477
SCHULER:
I've never been to a rodeo.

31:36.561 --> 31:38.605
LYDIA:
Well, you're going to love it.

31:39.772 --> 31:41.482
Gustavo?

31:44.360 --> 31:45.403
SCHULER:
Prosit.

31:45.486 --> 31:46.821
LYDIA: Prosit.
-Prost.

31:50.199 --> 31:53.578
Uh, "Your guest will relax
in the elegant great room,

31:53.661 --> 31:56.623
complete with soaring stone fireplace."

31:56.706 --> 32:00.543
-Soaring stone?
-Yeah, that's the best kind of stone.

32:02.128 --> 32:04.756
How about a lavender farm?

32:04.839 --> 32:05.757
Seriously?

32:05.840 --> 32:08.885
Yeah, well, it's lavender-adjacent.

32:08.968 --> 32:10.136
Tell me more.

32:10.219 --> 32:12.221
"Imagine a magical land called home.

32:12.305 --> 32:15.475
Watch the sunset across your own private meadow

32:15.558 --> 32:18.478
as wildflowers sway in the breeze.

32:18.561 --> 32:23.441
This stunning desert retreat promotes
a casual yet luxurious lifestyle."

32:23.524 --> 32:25.318
I'm casual yet luxurious.

32:25.401 --> 32:27.779
Yeah. Totally.

32:27.862 --> 32:29.656
It's got a five-car garage.

32:29.739 --> 32:31.658
KIM:
What? How's that gonna work?

32:31.741 --> 32:34.911
-We only get two-and-a-half cars each?
JIMMY: Yeah. Garbage.

32:34.994 --> 32:41.376
Ha-ha. So that was wildflowers dancing in the sun?

32:41.459 --> 32:44.337
-They're swaying in the breeze.
-Oh.

32:44.420 --> 32:46.005
Okay. Well, either way.

32:46.089 --> 32:47.882
They're having a very nice time.

33:10.947 --> 33:13.616
Saul Goodman, speedy justice for you.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.201
MIKE :
<i>I need a word.</i>

33:16.202 --> 33:20.206
Oh. A word? Yeah. Yeah, I have a word for you.

33:20.289 --> 33:24.043
"Tunnel." Which is where I am right now.

33:24.127 --> 33:26.921
Sorry, I can't hear you. Maybe try again later?

33:28.381 --> 33:29.340
Coming.

33:31.718 --> 33:35.346
Whatever it is, it's not for me.
But it should be for you.

33:36.723 --> 33:38.933
Hey, forget your key...?

33:39.017 --> 33:40.435
Oh.

33:42.729 --> 33:45.648
Okay, yeah, come right in.

33:45.732 --> 33:47.567
Make yourself at home.

33:48.860 --> 33:52.363
You got me in my underwear, so enjoy the show.

33:54.615 --> 33:59.370
You're representing Eduardo Salamanca,
aka Jorge De Guzman?

34:00.496 --> 34:03.624
Yeah, he's a client of mine. Yeah. So?

34:03.708 --> 34:07.128
Well, I need you to get him out on bail.

34:08.379 --> 34:11.841
Wait, what do you have to do
with Lalo Salamanca?

34:11.924 --> 34:15.094
I represent someone who has an interest.

34:15.178 --> 34:16.846
Someone like who?

34:16.929 --> 34:20.141
Someone your client can never know about.

34:20.224 --> 34:24.062
Yeah, look, I don't take marching orders
from the man behind the curtain.

34:24.145 --> 34:27.565
Mm? In this case, it's better that you do.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.489
You know what Salamanca did, right?

34:35.615 --> 34:37.492
I am aware.

34:40.953 --> 34:42.538
What's this?

34:42.622 --> 34:46.000
This is everything you need...

34:47.001 --> 34:48.961
to do your job.

36:55.838 --> 36:57.173
Go.

38:13.082 --> 38:17.586
Significant ties to his local community? What ties?

38:17.670 --> 38:21.924
Did you actually think I wasn't gonna hear
about this private eye of yours?

38:22.008 --> 38:24.176
-Excuse me?
-Dave Clark.

38:25.428 --> 38:30.057
Dave Clark. The mysterious third party
who's coaching your key witness.

38:31.851 --> 38:33.602
All right, good. You know what?

38:33.686 --> 38:36.439
Do the dumb act for Parson. Please.

38:36.522 --> 38:39.900
I can't wait to see him rip you both a new one.

38:43.654 --> 38:46.574
Any idea what that asshole is going on about?

38:49.410 --> 38:51.329
I'll call the librarian.

39:05.718 --> 39:07.178
Hey.

39:07.261 --> 39:09.889
Uh, play to the judge, okay?

39:09.972 --> 39:14.435
But don't-- Don't "play" to the judge. Don't overdo it.

39:14.518 --> 39:17.772
Try not to be too cool. I mean, look humble.

39:19.523 --> 39:21.275
A little bit scared.

39:22.651 --> 39:24.195
No problem.

39:27.573 --> 39:30.076
-Is that them?
-Yep.

39:33.871 --> 39:35.164
Who's that?

39:39.502 --> 39:42.254
It's gotta be his family.

39:42.338 --> 39:44.548
-Fred Whalen.
-Hm.

39:47.093 --> 39:50.846
-The guy who died at the Travel Wire.
-Mm.

40:18.457 --> 40:20.376
JUDGE:
Mr. Goodman?

40:22.878 --> 40:24.422
Mr. Goodman.

40:26.924 --> 40:31.095
That's right, Your Honor. Witness tampering.

40:31.178 --> 40:32.388
I have reason to believe

40:32.471 --> 40:35.516
that the prosecution's key witness was coached

40:35.599 --> 40:40.521
by a private investigator
who was hired to pervert justice.

40:41.772 --> 40:44.024
Does the prosecution have a response?

40:45.192 --> 40:46.861
Unfortunately, Your Honor,

40:46.944 --> 40:51.490
it seems a person unknown to my team
may have interacted with our witness,

40:51.574 --> 40:53.492
causing her to call Detective Roberts

40:53.576 --> 40:57.163
and amend her statement
two months after the initial interview.

40:57.246 --> 41:02.877
This only recently came to our attention,
and we are vigorously investigating.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.962
I would hope so.

41:05.045 --> 41:10.050
Having said that, Your Honor, this witness
is one small element of the state's case.

41:10.134 --> 41:13.846
In light of the extraordinary violence of the crime

41:13.929 --> 41:18.726
and the fact that Mr. De Guzman is
a foreign national with no ties to the community,

41:18.809 --> 41:21.812
we ask that the Court recognize him as a flight risk

41:21.896 --> 41:24.482
and as a danger to the citizens of New Mexico.

41:25.900 --> 41:27.401
JUDGE:
Mr. Goodman?

41:29.278 --> 41:31.447
Uh, all due respect, Your Honor,

41:31.530 --> 41:36.243
but the witness is not just one small element
of the state's case,

41:36.327 --> 41:40.789
she's the only witness tying Mr. De Guzman
to the murder scene.

41:40.873 --> 41:43.417
And she's been manipulated.

41:43.501 --> 41:47.296
Furthermore, the claim that Mr. De Guzman
has no ties to the community,

41:47.379 --> 41:49.507
that's just patently false.

41:49.590 --> 41:53.886
Mr. De Guzman has deep ties
to the city of Albuquerque.

41:53.969 --> 41:56.889
I'd like you to meet his family.

41:56.972 --> 42:01.310
That's his fiancée
and the love of his life, Beth McKinnon.

42:01.393 --> 42:04.271
His stepchildren, Christopher and Ella.

42:04.355 --> 42:07.983
And sitting with them is Beth's mother, Mary.

42:09.026 --> 42:10.819
Now, Your Honor,

42:10.903 --> 42:14.657
my client is the only father
that these kids have ever known.

42:14.740 --> 42:15.908
They depend on him.

42:15.991 --> 42:21.830
How can you possibly see fit
to separate this beautiful family?

42:23.123 --> 42:24.458
Um...

42:24.542 --> 42:25.709
I'm sorry.

42:26.877 --> 42:31.382
The testimony, uh, implicating Mr. De Guzman

42:31.465 --> 42:32.925
in this crime,

42:33.008 --> 42:34.552
it's been fabricated.

42:34.635 --> 42:37.054
You've already held him for three days.

42:37.137 --> 42:41.934
Given the circumstances,
Mr. De Guzman should be granted bond.

42:42.017 --> 42:44.144
Your Honor, a sidebar?

43:03.956 --> 43:06.250
ADA GINA: Your Honor, I really--
JUDGE: Sit.

43:12.881 --> 43:16.802
I accept the defense's argument
that bond is warranted.

43:18.012 --> 43:21.515
But considering the severity of the charges,

43:21.599 --> 43:24.310
I will set the amount at 7 million.

43:24.393 --> 43:26.186
-Cash only.
-Oh, Your Honor...

43:28.105 --> 43:29.648
All rise.

43:34.278 --> 43:35.487
Seven million.

43:35.571 --> 43:37.448
Listen, I am so, so sorry.

43:37.531 --> 43:39.199
I can do that.

43:40.242 --> 43:41.410
The thing is...

43:42.578 --> 43:44.955
-I'm gonna need you to pick it up.
-What, me?

43:45.039 --> 43:47.708
Mm-hm. I'll call you.

44:11.565 --> 44:12.608
HOWARD:
Hey, Jimmy.

44:13.859 --> 44:14.985
Howard.

44:17.237 --> 44:20.574
So, have you thought any more about the job?

44:21.575 --> 44:24.578
The job. Yeah.

44:24.662 --> 44:25.954
No, um...

44:27.164 --> 44:30.125
I'm still giving it some thought.

44:33.337 --> 44:34.505
Giving it some thought?

44:37.174 --> 44:38.258
Yeah.

44:40.803 --> 44:43.389
You know what? Don't bother.

44:44.390 --> 44:48.018
It seems I've upset you. So offer's off the table.

44:49.061 --> 44:51.105
You upset me-- How'd you upset me?

44:52.231 --> 44:53.399
You tell me.

44:58.445 --> 45:00.823
This is getting a little weird, Howard.

45:02.699 --> 45:04.410
You wanna know what's weird?

45:05.452 --> 45:07.204
It's weird to offer a job to a man,

45:07.287 --> 45:09.415
and in return,
have bowling balls thrown at your car.

45:10.541 --> 45:13.293
And prostitutes sent to your business lunch.

45:14.586 --> 45:16.004
That's weird.

45:17.172 --> 45:19.383
Are you listening to yourself?

45:19.466 --> 45:23.303
Ahem, I don't know
what you're into these days, Howard, but, heh...

45:23.387 --> 45:26.723
prostitutes and bowling balls?

45:27.724 --> 45:29.810
You sound unhinged.

45:33.814 --> 45:35.858
Jimmy, I'm sorry you're in pain.

45:38.026 --> 45:39.945
You're sorry.

45:40.028 --> 45:41.447
You're sorry?

45:42.531 --> 45:45.409
You killed my brother, and you say you're sorry?

45:46.452 --> 45:50.038
Let me tell you something.
The job offer, it didn't upset me.

45:50.122 --> 45:52.040
It amused me.

45:52.124 --> 45:56.170
Ooh, big job at the illustrious HHM.

45:56.253 --> 45:58.881
A chance to play at the palace. Little old me?

45:58.964 --> 46:01.800
-I was trying...
-You have no idea what's going on.

46:01.884 --> 46:05.888
You're a teensy, tiny man
in a teensy-weensy, little bubble.

46:05.971 --> 46:09.016
-Oh, Jimmy.
-Oh, don't you fucking "Oh, Jimmy" me.

46:09.099 --> 46:11.226
You look down on me? You pity me?

46:11.310 --> 46:12.936
Walk away. That's right, Howard.

46:13.020 --> 46:14.480
You know why I didn't take the job?

46:14.563 --> 46:16.523
Because it's too small!

46:16.607 --> 46:18.484
I don't care about it!

46:18.567 --> 46:21.445
It's nothing to me! It's a bacterium!

46:21.528 --> 46:24.448
I travel in worlds you can't even imagine!

46:24.531 --> 46:27.075
You can't conceive of what I'm capable of!

46:27.159 --> 46:29.369
I'm so far beyond you!

46:29.453 --> 46:31.622
I'm like a god in human clothing!

46:31.705 --> 46:35.125
Lightning bolts shoot from my fingertips!
