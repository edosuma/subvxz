00:02.001 --> 00:03.836
Previously on Lost:

00:06.382 --> 00:08.341
- Damn it!
- You all right, brother?

00:08.425 --> 00:10.426
I'm fine. I'm fine.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.845
- I'm training.
- You're training for what?

00:12.930 --> 00:15.264
For a race around the world.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.769
- Jack.
- I'm Desmond.

00:20.938 --> 00:23.147
See you in another life, yeah?

00:41.625 --> 00:44.919
Type in exactly what I tell you,
understand? Nothing else.

00:45.003 --> 00:48.673
Four... eight...

00:50.134 --> 00:52.051
...15...

00:52.136 --> 00:53.177
...16...

00:55.055 --> 00:56.472
...23...

00:57.933 --> 00:59.308
...42.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.852
Now press "Execute."

01:00.936 --> 01:03.646
- What's gonna happen?
- Just push it!

01:04.063 --> 01:06.149
Kate! Locke!

01:06.734 --> 01:09.026
Who the hell is that?

01:10.904 --> 01:12.822
Move and I kill him.

01:30.382 --> 01:33.217
- Michael! Sawyer!
- Jin!

01:37.806 --> 01:40.600
Others! Others! Others!

01:40.684 --> 01:42.852
- What?
- Others.

02:35.197 --> 02:40.243
Where's my boy?

02:40.536 --> 02:41.828
Hey!

02:41.912 --> 02:45.456
Hey, what did you do with my boy?
You hear me?

02:45.541 --> 02:47.041
Come back here!

02:50.003 --> 02:52.755
Do you want him to die? Put it down.

02:58.762 --> 03:02.557
Is this what you were talking about,
Locke? Is this your destiny?

03:05.936 --> 03:08.187
"All roads lead here."

03:10.399 --> 03:12.692
My mother stole again from me this week.

03:12.943 --> 03:16.487
I don't even keep money in my purse
anymore, I've been hiding it.

03:16.947 --> 03:19.365
But when she wants a drink...

03:20.242 --> 03:22.118
She stole $30.

03:22.953 --> 03:26.122
I know it may not seem like
a lot of money to some of you,

03:26.206 --> 03:29.542
but it's a lot to me.
And I want it back.

03:32.671 --> 03:35.006
Something you want to say?

03:36.633 --> 03:40.136
John, you've been coming here
for a month now...

03:40.220 --> 03:43.723
I just don't think $30
is worth getting angry about.

03:43.807 --> 03:45.600
Francine feels $30...

03:45.684 --> 03:48.311
Francine feels a little too much,
if you ask me.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.479
You all do.

03:51.148 --> 03:54.734
I mean, seriously...
"So-and-so never called me back."

03:54.818 --> 03:58.821
"My mother stole $30."
I never even knew who my parents were.

03:59.948 --> 04:03.284
Couple years ago,
my birth mother found me.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.578
And...

04:05.662 --> 04:07.705
...she told me...

04:09.791 --> 04:11.876
...I was special.

04:14.087 --> 04:19.675
And through her I met my real father.
Great news, right?

04:19.760 --> 04:23.596
Well, he pretended to love me,
just long enough to steal my kidney,

04:23.680 --> 04:25.640
because he had to have a transplant.

04:25.724 --> 04:29.352
And then he dropped me back
in the world like a piece of trash,

04:29.436 --> 04:32.229
just like he did
on the day that I was born.

04:34.066 --> 04:38.027
You want your damn $30 back?
I want my kidney back!

04:48.747 --> 04:51.207
Probably a good idea.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.628
You know if you get kidney cancer,
you've only got one.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.714
That's funny.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.843
I'm sorry if I ruined your meeting.

05:02.928 --> 05:06.973
Oh, hell. You just said everything
I've always wanted to say in there.

05:07.057 --> 05:11.102
Most of the time, I want to stand up
and scream, "Get over it, freaks!"

05:11.186 --> 05:14.480
- Well, why don't you?
- Ah, I have to keep a cork in.

05:14.564 --> 05:17.942
Once I get all hot and bothered,
there's no stopping me.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.698
Guess you won't be coming back
next week, huh?

05:23.782 --> 05:25.866
No, not likely.

05:25.951 --> 05:28.828
That's too bad. I like bald guys.

05:29.913 --> 05:32.123
- I'm not bald.
- I can wait.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.588
I'm Helen, by the way.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.467
Hi, Helen. I'm John.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.471
Where's Kate?

05:47.556 --> 05:50.141
Lower your gun
or I'll blow his damned head off.

05:50.225 --> 05:52.393
Where's Kate?

06:42.152 --> 06:44.695
- Put it down.
- I'm not putting down anything!

06:44.821 --> 06:46.822
Jack, calm down. It's OK.

06:54.331 --> 06:55.748
- Do not move!
- Don't...

06:55.832 --> 06:57.374
- What?
- He's unarmed...

06:57.459 --> 06:59.668
He just had a gun pointed at your head!

07:03.423 --> 07:08.636
What did you do?

07:13.266 --> 07:22.066
We're all gonna die.

07:42.587 --> 07:45.464
- I have to fix it.
- What the hell's he talking about?

07:45.549 --> 07:48.300
Listen! If you do not let me up,
we are going to die.

07:48.385 --> 07:52.263
- Stop moving, or, I swear to God...
- Look at the wall! You see that?

07:53.390 --> 07:55.558
That's a timer and it's counting down.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.937
I've got to enter the code,
got to push the button.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.814
- Or what?
- Jack, let him up.

08:01.898 --> 08:04.400
Don't tell me what to do. Or what?

08:05.068 --> 08:07.486
What's going to happen?

08:08.613 --> 08:10.197
Do I know you?

08:17.581 --> 08:19.248
You got him?

08:28.550 --> 08:30.259
Bastard!

08:34.139 --> 08:36.472
- What?
- Nothing, Jack.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.949
Hey.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.285
What are you doing?

09:00.332 --> 09:02.625
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere. I...

09:04.794 --> 09:09.215
I... just have trouble
sleeping in a strange bed.

09:12.177 --> 09:16.180
It has nothing to do with you, Helen.
I promise. I really like you.

09:19.768 --> 09:22.061
I'm sorry, I'll call you later.

09:45.543 --> 09:49.755
Morning.

09:50.882 --> 09:54.218
John, I know you like to drive
through my neighborhood.

09:54.302 --> 09:59.306
And I know that every now and then,
you like to park outside my house.

10:01.351 --> 10:05.271
Now, I thought it might all stop
when I moved, but here you are.

10:07.524 --> 10:10.401
Now, I'll admit,
at first I thought it was funny.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.655
Now it's just annoying.

10:14.739 --> 10:17.449
So how about you tell me
what the hell it is you want.

10:22.205 --> 10:25.791
- Why?
- Excuse me?

10:28.545 --> 10:30.087
Why?

10:38.471 --> 10:40.556
There is no "why."

10:41.891 --> 10:45.060
You think you're the first person
that ever got conned?

10:45.186 --> 10:48.063
You needed a father figure,
and I needed a kidney.

10:48.148 --> 10:51.150
And that's what happened.

10:51.234 --> 10:53.360
Get over it.

10:55.530 --> 10:58.073
And, John, don't come back.

11:00.702 --> 11:03.037
You're not wanted.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.687
I don't think you need that, Kate.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.652
Whatever you're looking for,
maybe I can help.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.821
Can you fix a computer?

11:38.406 --> 11:41.408
- Then you can't help me.
- Sayid can fix a computer.

11:42.535 --> 11:46.872
- Get him. Go and get Sayid.
- Can you get back up that rope?

11:46.956 --> 11:49.208
There's got to be a front door here.

11:49.292 --> 11:53.253
Down the corridor to the left.
Be persistent, the wheel sticks.

11:55.298 --> 11:56.757
Got ya!

12:12.482 --> 12:16.402
- Now, tell me what's going on.
- We don't have time...

12:16.486 --> 12:19.405
- We're taking a time-out.
- Please, just let me...

12:19.489 --> 12:22.032
You wanna get to work?
Tell me how you got here.

12:23.243 --> 12:26.703
It was three years ago.
I was on a solo race around the world,

12:26.788 --> 12:29.540
and my boat crashed into the reef
and Kelvin came.

12:29.999 --> 12:32.418
- Kelvin?
- He comes runnin' out the jungle,

12:32.502 --> 12:34.420
"Hurry! Hurry! Come with me!"

12:35.588 --> 12:37.506
He brings me down here.

12:38.133 --> 12:40.467
First thing he does,
'cause it's beeping,

12:40.552 --> 12:43.345
he types in the code,
pushes the button and it stops.

12:46.641 --> 12:49.017
"What was all that about?" I say.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.104
"Just saving the world," he says.

12:54.524 --> 12:57.651
- "Saving the world?"
- His words, not mine.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.948
So I started pushing the button too.

13:04.200 --> 13:07.119
We saved the world together
for a while, and that was lovely.

13:07.203 --> 13:10.706
Then Kelvin died.
And now here I am all alone.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.587
The end!

13:30.560 --> 13:33.145
Don't tell me you believe this.
This is crazy.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.981
You think that makes sense?
Pushing a button?

13:36.566 --> 13:40.652
- You're going to take his word for it?
- His word is all we have, Jack.

13:41.863 --> 13:45.032
You don't have to take my word for it.
Watch the film.

13:47.285 --> 13:50.162
- What?
- The bookcase. Top shelf.

13:50.246 --> 13:53.207
Behind Turn of the Screw.
Projector's in the pantry.

14:28.910 --> 14:30.577
Here...

14:33.373 --> 14:37.292
Dude, I gotta say, I didn't think
we were gonna get through the night.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.421
And I wasn't even here
for that baby-stealing part.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.174
I can assure you it was very exciting.

14:44.259 --> 14:46.843
Things are finally returning
to normalness.

14:46.928 --> 14:48.971
Sayid!

14:49.931 --> 14:51.139
Aw, crap.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.269
Sayid! We need your help.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.946
What do you know?
What'd they do to you?

15:06.030 --> 15:09.533
Who the hell are they?
Who the hell are they?

15:12.328 --> 15:14.079
Others!

15:15.832 --> 15:18.584
- Did you see Walt?
- The Others? How many?

15:20.128 --> 15:21.378
How many?

15:23.673 --> 15:26.842
- They had him blindfolded. Blindfolded.
- Yes!

15:26.926 --> 15:29.720
Could be a hundred of them out there!

15:33.558 --> 15:35.267
- Push me up.
- What?

15:35.351 --> 15:38.687
Push me up.
I wanna try and get us outta here.

15:40.857 --> 15:42.983
C'mon, help us out, Chewie.

15:59.208 --> 16:03.462
They got it weighted down with
something. It's tied off somewhere.

16:05.548 --> 16:07.257
Come on, lift me higher.

16:46.923 --> 16:49.007
It's a girl.

16:57.016 --> 17:00.936
Wanna tell me what was going on
down here before I showed up, John?

17:01.354 --> 17:05.982
Kate was tied up. Desmond had a gun on
me. I think you caught the gist of it.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.278
Desmond.

17:11.989 --> 17:14.281
He wanted to know a lot about us.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.702
How we got here. If we were sick.

17:16.786 --> 17:20.038
- You didn't ask anything about him?
- He was the one with the gun.

17:20.123 --> 17:24.626
You seem calm for someone who believes
the world's going to end in 45 minutes.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.627
He'll fix it.

17:28.423 --> 17:33.051
You understand that what he's saying,
it's insane. It's impossible.

17:33.136 --> 17:35.137
Why is it insane?

17:36.264 --> 17:39.433
The last time I saw the computer
that would save the world,

17:39.517 --> 17:40.934
it didn't look like that.

17:41.018 --> 17:44.438
Is the reason you're so upset
because he said he recognized you?

17:52.613 --> 17:55.615
Because that would be impossible.

18:20.183 --> 18:24.728
Welcome. I'm Dr. Marvin Candle,
and this is the orientation film

18:24.812 --> 18:27.606
for Station Three
of the Dharma Initiative.

18:27.690 --> 18:31.193
In a moment, you'll be given
a simple set of instructions

18:31.277 --> 18:34.780
for how you and your partner
will fulfill the responsibilities

18:34.864 --> 18:38.408
associated with this station.
But first, a little history.

18:39.202 --> 18:42.621
The Dharma Initiative
was created in 1970

18:42.705 --> 18:45.874
and is the brainchild
of Gerald and Karen DeGroot,

18:45.958 --> 18:49.085
two doctoral candidates
at the University of Michigan.

18:49.170 --> 18:53.131
Following in the footsteps
of visionaries such as BF Skinner...

18:53.216 --> 18:57.010
...imagined a large-scale
communal research compound

18:57.094 --> 19:01.473
where scientists and free-thinkers from
around the globe could pursue research

19:01.557 --> 19:07.437
in meteorology, psychology,
parapsychology, zoology,

19:07.522 --> 19:10.899
electromagnetism,
and utopian social...

19:11.025 --> 19:15.445
...reclusive Danish industrialist
and munitions magnate Alvar Hanso,

19:15.530 --> 19:17.864
whose financial backing made their dream

19:17.949 --> 19:22.327
of a multi-purpose social science
research facility a reality.

19:23.329 --> 19:27.707
You and your partner are currently
located in Station Three, or "The Swan,"

19:27.792 --> 19:30.418
and will be for the next 540 days.

19:31.045 --> 19:34.339
Station Three was originally constructed
as a laboratory

19:34.423 --> 19:36.800
where scientists
could work to understand

19:36.884 --> 19:39.386
the unique electromagnetic fluctuations

19:39.470 --> 19:41.847
emanating from this sector
of the island.

19:42.932 --> 19:48.478
Not long after the experiments began,
however, there was... an incident.

19:49.772 --> 19:53.149
Since that time, the following
protocol has been observed.

19:54.068 --> 19:57.988
Every 108 minutes,
the button must be pushed.

19:58.781 --> 20:01.199
From the moment the alarm sounds,

20:01.284 --> 20:06.329
you will have four minutes to enter the
code into the microcomputer processor...

20:06.455 --> 20:08.540
...induction into the program.

20:08.624 --> 20:13.712
When the alarm sounds, either you
or your partner must input the code.

20:14.505 --> 20:18.758
It is highly recommended that you and
your partner take alternating shifts.

20:18.843 --> 20:21.845
In this manner,
you will both stay as fresh and alert...

20:21.929 --> 20:24.639
...utmost importance
that when the alarm sounds,

20:24.724 --> 20:28.518
the code be entered correctly
and in a timely fashion.

20:28.603 --> 20:32.355
Do not attempt to use
the computer for anything...

20:32.982 --> 20:34.733
Congratulations!

20:34.817 --> 20:39.654
Until your replacements arrive, the
future of the project is in your hands.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.991
On behalf of the DeGroots, Alvar Hanso,

20:43.117 --> 20:45.493
and all of us at the Dharma Initiative,

20:45.620 --> 20:50.707
thank you, namaste, and good luck.

21:03.888 --> 21:06.139
We're gonna need to watch that again.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.938
What's that?

21:13.022 --> 21:17.776
It's a present. It's been six months.
Sort of an anniversary, right?

21:21.280 --> 21:24.032
- I didn't get you anything.
- That's OK.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.533
Only cost me a buck.

21:35.711 --> 21:39.047
It's to my place.
Thought you might be tired of knocking.

21:43.511 --> 21:45.387
Well, Helen, I...

21:46.055 --> 21:47.389
I don't know what to say.

21:49.392 --> 21:52.519
There's just one condition though, John.

21:53.771 --> 21:57.232
When you stay over, you stay over.

21:58.234 --> 21:59.275
What do you mean?

22:00.945 --> 22:02.737
I followed you last night.

22:03.656 --> 22:06.199
To that house that you go to.

22:08.202 --> 22:10.161
Is it your father's house?

22:17.378 --> 22:20.380
Why would you follow me, Helen?
Why would you do that?

22:21.257 --> 22:23.591
You sneak off
in the middle of the night.

22:23.676 --> 22:26.052
I just needed to know
where you were going.

22:26.137 --> 22:27.470
I care about you, John...

22:27.596 --> 22:30.223
But what I do is my business.
It's personal.

22:30.307 --> 22:33.893
I wasted 20 years of my life
being angry.

22:35.062 --> 22:39.774
I told myself I would get over it,
but I... I couldn't do it alone.

22:41.986 --> 22:44.112
I needed to find help.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.950
You help me, John.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.788
And I can help you.

22:54.582 --> 22:58.668
You just have to promise me that you're
not gonna go to that place anymore.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.883
All right.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.219
All right?

23:32.828 --> 23:34.579
You're gonna watch that again?

23:36.499 --> 23:40.293
- Aren't you?
- No, John. I'm not.

24:00.856 --> 24:02.107
OK, OK!

24:02.191 --> 24:04.359
You all right, sister?

24:06.779 --> 24:10.156
- Who are you?
- We crashed here.

24:10.241 --> 24:13.326
We were on a plane.
Sydney to Los Angeles...

24:14.870 --> 24:17.622
- What?
- Forty of us made it.

24:21.585 --> 24:22.961
Flight 815?

24:26.674 --> 24:27.674
You were on it too?

24:29.885 --> 24:32.137
What? You were in the back?

24:35.057 --> 24:38.768
- It broke off mid-air, how did you...
- I don't know, I don't know.

24:38.853 --> 24:41.437
The plane came apart,

24:41.522 --> 24:45.984
and somebody's fricking hardside came
out of the overhead and knocked me out.

24:46.068 --> 24:48.236
I woke up underwater and...

24:49.238 --> 24:52.282
...made my way to the top.
Swam to shore.

24:54.410 --> 24:57.996
You been out here by yourself
all this time?

24:59.123 --> 25:03.376
Trying to find food. Making my way,
hoping to find somebody...

25:04.753 --> 25:07.422
And then, yesterday, they found me.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.966
- Who are they?
- You tell me.

25:10.050 --> 25:14.429
Did you see a boy? Ten years old?
They took my son.

25:16.724 --> 25:19.225
No. I'm sorry.

25:21.103 --> 25:23.855
- I'm Ana Lucia.
- Sawyer.

25:24.940 --> 25:27.025
This is Mike.

25:27.776 --> 25:30.153
The quiet Korean guy's Jin.

25:31.322 --> 25:34.741
We're about to be the best thing
that ever happened to you.

25:34.825 --> 25:36.492
How's that?

25:36.619 --> 25:39.245
Next time Shaft opens the cage,

25:40.623 --> 25:43.791
he's gonna get
a surprising little "howdy-doody."

25:51.383 --> 25:54.052
Are you in contact with the people
who made it?

25:54.136 --> 25:56.846
The film?
Are you in contact with anyone?

25:57.640 --> 25:59.891
Do you think I'd be here if I was?

26:01.477 --> 26:05.313
How is it that you didn't know
about the crash? About us?

26:06.815 --> 26:10.485
I push this button every 108 minutes.

26:11.654 --> 26:13.988
I don't get out much.

26:14.865 --> 26:16.991
So these replacements...

26:17.826 --> 26:21.204
Kelvin died
waiting for his replacements.

26:23.123 --> 26:27.168
So you don't get out, you don't see
anyone, where's your food come from?

26:27.753 --> 26:31.047
- You really think this is happening?
- Why wouldn't it be?

26:33.008 --> 26:36.970
It says "quarantine" on the inside
of the hatch to keep you down here,

26:37.054 --> 26:39.347
keep you scared. But you know what?

26:39.473 --> 26:42.600
We've been up there for over 40 days
and no one's gotten sick.

26:42.685 --> 26:45.353
You think this is the only part of it
that's true?

26:45.437 --> 26:49.065
Did you ever think they put you here
to push a button every 100 minutes

26:49.149 --> 26:52.443
just to see if you would?
That the computer, the button,

26:52.528 --> 26:55.196
it's just a mind game? An experiment?

26:57.074 --> 26:59.492
Every single day.

27:06.125 --> 27:08.876
And for all our sakes,
I hope it's not real.

27:11.964 --> 27:15.675
But the film says this is
an electromagnetic station.

27:15.759 --> 27:18.052
And I don't about you, brother,

27:18.137 --> 27:22.390
but every time I walk past that concrete
wall out there, my fillings hurt.

27:26.729 --> 27:28.563
Right.

27:41.577 --> 27:43.828
Oh, no!

27:43.912 --> 27:45.663
What happened?

27:51.587 --> 27:53.838
It's over.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.637
What do you mean, "It's over?"

28:15.069 --> 28:18.488
What are you doing? Are you leaving?

28:19.323 --> 28:21.616
Desmond. Wait.

28:24.370 --> 28:27.872
We can fix the computer.
Sayid is coming. He knows...

28:27.956 --> 28:30.083
Give him my best.

28:38.592 --> 28:41.552
Wait, wait! Where are you...
You can't leave!

28:43.514 --> 28:45.431
Where are you going?

28:45.516 --> 28:47.725
As far as I can run, brother.

28:55.317 --> 28:57.402
- What should we do?
- Nothing.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.947
We do nothing. It's not real.
None of it's real.

29:01.031 --> 29:03.699
No...
This isn't what was supposed to happen.

29:05.702 --> 29:07.829
What was supposed to happen?

29:07.913 --> 29:13.334
- Please! Don't leave me here.
- Goodbye, John. You're on your own.

29:13.419 --> 29:14.502
Jack.

29:44.700 --> 29:46.367
Damn it!

29:47.202 --> 29:50.288
Why is this happening like this?
What do you want?

29:53.375 --> 29:55.751
What am I supposed to do?

30:43.425 --> 30:45.092
Helen, what...

30:45.219 --> 30:48.262
Helen, what...
Hey, Helen, wait.

30:49.097 --> 30:51.349
Helen! Don't!

30:51.433 --> 30:53.100
Helen!

30:56.605 --> 30:58.022
Why are you doing this?

30:58.106 --> 31:01.651
He's not coming out of his house,
John, because he doesn't care.

31:01.735 --> 31:05.154
I know why you're here,
why you keep coming here.

31:05.239 --> 31:10.701
You're scared. You're scared
of moving forward, with me, with us.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.623
You're gonna have to choose.

31:17.042 --> 31:19.043
Him or me.

31:21.797 --> 31:24.215
No, no. No, it's not that simple.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.008
Yes, it is.

31:28.178 --> 31:29.804
I...

31:32.140 --> 31:34.100
I can't.

31:34.184 --> 31:37.353
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't!

31:45.571 --> 31:47.363
I don't know how.

31:47.447 --> 31:50.575
Because you don't know
what's gonna happen.

31:52.035 --> 31:54.161
None of us do.

31:55.414 --> 31:58.583
That's why it's called
a "leap of faith," John.

32:02.087 --> 32:04.255
You don't have to be alone.

32:24.484 --> 32:26.152
Jack?

32:30.699 --> 32:32.199
John.

32:40.208 --> 32:41.208
Dude...

32:44.296 --> 32:45.588
What is this place?

32:47.549 --> 32:52.094
- John, where's Jack?
- Jack's gone. I need your help.

32:57.351 --> 33:00.019
- What does it look like?
- It's a breaker box.

33:00.103 --> 33:02.980
There has to be one.
Follow the conduit lines.

33:03.065 --> 33:05.733
Cool, OK. Great. What's a conduit line?

33:06.985 --> 33:09.570
Those tubes. Follow those.

33:25.629 --> 33:27.463
Did you find it?

33:30.801 --> 33:33.094
Depends what you mean by "it."

33:40.185 --> 33:43.020
Here's what we do.
Jin plays dead. You call for help.

33:43.105 --> 33:45.690
Sick prisoner? You serious?

33:45.774 --> 33:48.150
What, you got a better idea, sweetheart?

33:49.111 --> 33:51.529
- Where'd you get that gun, anyway?
- What?

33:51.613 --> 33:53.614
The gun, how'd you get it on the plane?

33:53.699 --> 33:56.200
There was a federal marshal
on the plane.

33:56.284 --> 33:59.578
So, what? You just happened
to have his gun?

33:59.663 --> 34:03.499
Yeah. I'm lucky.
Mike, let's get this thing going.

34:03.583 --> 34:06.377
How come you didn't use it
when they grabbed you?

34:07.796 --> 34:10.672
Guess I was too busy getting hit
in the face with a club.

34:14.928 --> 34:17.513
Why are you suddenly so interested,
cupcake?

34:17.597 --> 34:19.139
- Hey!
- What?

34:19.224 --> 34:20.558
Come on, we gotta...

34:22.643 --> 34:24.937
Back up! Back up!

34:29.568 --> 34:30.609
Coming out.

34:32.279 --> 34:34.029
Coming out!

34:46.168 --> 34:48.252
What happened? Who are they?

35:12.694 --> 35:13.986
Damn!

35:18.366 --> 35:19.950
Stop!

35:22.704 --> 35:24.580
Oh, right.

35:25.707 --> 35:28.125
- The code, yeah?
- What?

35:28.210 --> 35:29.627
Listen carefully.

35:29.711 --> 35:33.631
If by some miracle you get
that computer working, enter the code.

35:33.715 --> 35:37.092
Four, eight, 15, 16, 23, 42.
Hit "Execute."

35:37.177 --> 35:39.553
- Again. Four, eight, 15...
- Shut up!

35:40.722 --> 35:43.474
- Sorry?
- Nothing is going to happen.

35:44.476 --> 35:47.686
Some... man takes you down there,

35:47.771 --> 35:51.732
shows you a movie,
and you push a button on faith alone?

35:52.442 --> 35:55.027
Nothing is going to happen!

35:56.488 --> 36:00.324
In about 15 minutes, you're either gonna
be very right or very wrong.

36:00.408 --> 36:02.618
You wanna shoot me?
Shoot me. I'm not...

36:02.702 --> 36:06.664
Why are you running? You don't
even know what you're running from!

36:10.752 --> 36:12.837
I remember you.

36:14.506 --> 36:16.382
Running.

36:18.385 --> 36:20.928
I know you. I met you.

36:21.012 --> 36:24.139
- Stop.
- Los Angeles. I was training, yeah?

36:24.933 --> 36:26.851
- You twisted your ankle.
- Stop.

36:26.935 --> 36:31.188
You're a doctor, right? There was
this girl, you were worried, you said...

36:31.273 --> 36:32.606
You said you failed her.

36:35.110 --> 36:38.320
- That was you.
- It doesn't matter.

36:38.405 --> 36:42.533
- Was she OK? The girl?
- It doesn't matter.

36:42.617 --> 36:44.702
- What happened?
- It doesn't matter.

36:44.786 --> 36:47.705
- How can you say it doesn't...
- I married her!

36:57.048 --> 36:58.632
Right.

37:02.137 --> 37:04.013
Then, you're...

37:05.265 --> 37:07.975
You're not married to her anymore, then.

37:31.958 --> 37:34.501
See you in another life, yeah?

37:50.393 --> 37:52.519
Can you fix it?

37:53.521 --> 37:56.690
This man, whoever he was,
replaced the motherboard.

38:00.528 --> 38:04.198
- The power transformer is blown.
- Don't you need to know why?

38:04.950 --> 38:09.036
All I need to know is that the timer
is counting down to something,

38:09.913 --> 38:12.706
and that this computer
needs to be repaired.

38:12.791 --> 38:15.709
I'm sure you'll tell me why
once I've done so.

38:24.052 --> 38:25.928
Found it!

38:35.772 --> 38:37.314
- What's that?
- Sayid...

38:37.399 --> 38:39.316
I'm working on it.

38:39.401 --> 38:41.652
- You have to...
- I know what I have to do.

38:45.073 --> 38:48.450
Reconnected the processor.
Replaced the transformer.

38:55.375 --> 38:57.001
It's on!

38:57.085 --> 39:00.170
- OK, so what now?
- There was a code, he made me enter it.

39:00.255 --> 39:02.715
- What code?
- Can you remember what it is?

39:04.509 --> 39:07.344
- Four, eight...
- Wait a minute.

39:07.429 --> 39:11.015
- ...15, 16...
- Dude, I'm serious, stop!

39:11.099 --> 39:13.851
- This is not the time or the place...
- I think it is!

39:13.935 --> 39:15.019
Twenty-three.

39:15.103 --> 39:18.147
- We don't even know what it does!
- Thirty-two.

39:21.443 --> 39:24.695
You know what? Forget it.
Go ahead. Do your thing.

39:27.449 --> 39:29.658
It's not 32.

39:31.453 --> 39:33.162
It's 42.

39:35.415 --> 39:39.251
He just told me. Desmond.
The last number's 42.

39:40.795 --> 39:42.921
You're sure?

39:43.006 --> 39:45.340
Yeah. I'm sure.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.655
You do it, Jack.

40:11.659 --> 40:13.744
What?

40:14.496 --> 40:16.413
You have to do it.

40:17.957 --> 40:20.959
- You do it yourself, John.
- No, you saw the film, Jack.

40:21.044 --> 40:23.337
This is a two-person job. At least.

40:26.841 --> 40:30.094
- This argument is irrelevant.
- Sayid. Don't.

40:30.178 --> 40:32.096
- Jack.
- Don't. It's not real.

40:32.180 --> 40:34.973
Look, you want to push the button,
do it yourself.

40:35.058 --> 40:38.852
If it's not real, then why are you here?
Why did you come back?

40:39.646 --> 40:42.898
- Why do you find it so hard to believe?
- Why do you find it so easy?

40:42.982 --> 40:45.109
It's never been easy!

40:54.327 --> 40:55.911
Maybe you should just do it.

40:57.372 --> 41:00.833
No. It's a button.

41:04.045 --> 41:06.255
I can't do this alone, Jack.

41:09.592 --> 41:11.510
I don't want to.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.641
It's a leap of faith, Jack.

42:12.989 --> 42:15.282
I'll take the first shift.
