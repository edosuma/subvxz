So much for vacation.

01:51.060 --> 01:52.103
Excuse me,

01:52.520 --> 01:53.646
excuse me.

01:53.813 --> 01:55.398
Let me pass, please.

02:00.903 --> 02:04.115
Hey... what're you wearing?

02:04.281 --> 02:06.409
I was on a date.

02:06.450 --> 02:07.678
You should've changed.
There are cameras.

02:07.702 --> 02:08.953
You said hurry.

02:09.578 --> 02:10.578
Wait!

02:11.831 --> 02:12.831
What?

02:12.873 --> 02:13.958
Have you been drinking?

02:14.041 --> 02:16.752
You can tell? I only had one.

02:17.086 --> 02:19.714
Just hurry. Come on..

02:19.839 --> 02:21.465
All right, all right..

02:22.967 --> 02:23.968
You're here.

02:24.010 --> 02:25.511
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:26.721 --> 02:30.057
You can't show up looking like that.
There could be talk.

02:30.558 --> 02:32.101
What talk?

02:32.184 --> 02:34.228
Like how the police are lax now.

02:34.645 --> 02:35.771
Come on,

02:36.605 --> 02:37.898
what does that matter?

02:38.357 --> 02:39.650
You're driving me nuts.

02:39.692 --> 02:41.902
So, what's going on?

02:42.069 --> 02:43.255
Male and female hostages, one each.

02:43.279 --> 02:44.864
Southeast Asian suspects, in their 30s,

02:44.947 --> 02:46.282
armed with knives.

02:46.323 --> 02:47.783
They're speaking English.

02:47.950 --> 02:48.993
No Korean at all.

02:49.035 --> 02:50.202
That's why we called you in.

02:50.286 --> 02:51.579
Their demands?

02:52.413 --> 02:54.206
They want a helicopter. To escape.

02:54.373 --> 02:55.916
Looks like a simple robbery.

02:55.958 --> 02:58.336
They've seen too many movies.

02:58.377 --> 02:59.462
And the captain?

02:59.795 --> 03:01.630
He's not doing so well.

03:17.730 --> 03:19.482
It's his English.

03:25.571 --> 03:27.823
Hey, Inspector Ha is here!

03:28.949 --> 03:31.911
What are you doing here?

03:32.370 --> 03:33.555
I thought you were on vacation.

03:33.579 --> 03:36.374
I was. You approved it yourself.

03:36.540 --> 03:37.958
He just can't get through.

03:38.376 --> 03:39.919
It's okay. I'm already here now.

03:40.127 --> 03:41.921
What's the situation?

03:42.004 --> 03:44.840
What was explained earlier, that's it.

03:45.633 --> 03:46.884
I'll see what I can do.

03:46.926 --> 03:50.971
No, don't. We're sending in SWAT.

03:51.138 --> 03:54.392
You're not going to try
to talk to them first?

03:54.517 --> 03:56.310
They're not responding to any talk.

03:57.186 --> 03:58.354
So we're going in.

03:59.063 --> 04:00.606
Give me 30 minutes.

04:01.691 --> 04:03.401
I'll get them talking.

04:04.902 --> 04:06.278
Just 30 minutes.

What is she saying?

05:11.886 --> 05:13.137

Okay. Be careful.

What do we do?

06:46.856 --> 06:47.440
What do you mean?

06:47.481 --> 06:49.275
We wait. She's negotiating.

06:49.316 --> 06:51.610
If we don't act now,
we lose the hostages.

06:54.405 --> 06:55.322

11:08.325 --> 11:10.077
Can you give us a minute?

11:19.378 --> 11:21.339
Because of the incident?

11:22.506 --> 11:24.842
It wasn't your fault.

11:25.384 --> 11:31.307
I can't watch people die
in front of me anymore.

11:31.515 --> 11:33.893
You also saved lives.
You don't think about that?

11:35.061 --> 11:39.440
I really think this isn't for me.

11:40.441 --> 11:41.525
I'm sorry.

Sir...

13:20.332 --> 13:22.543
You can't just barge in like this.

13:22.585 --> 13:25.713
You've showered? Good.
Where are your clothes?

13:26.213 --> 13:27.715

Where is your uniform?

13:33.262 --> 13:34.805
I quit, remember?

13:34.889 --> 13:36.766
It hasn't been processed yet,

13:38.309 --> 13:39.829
and the commissioner wants to see you.

13:40.478 --> 13:41.020
What?

13:41.062 --> 13:43.105
The commissioner called for you.

13:43.147 --> 13:44.315
Hurry.

13:55.618 --> 13:57.078

Sit there.

15:23.080 --> 15:24.373
Who am I talking to?

15:24.415 --> 15:26.375
- There's no time to explain.
- Well, at least...

15:26.417 --> 15:29.420
Take the call first. There's the camera.

15:39.180 --> 15:40.181
Connect us.

15:44.560 --> 15:47.146
<i>What's wrong with this thing? Fuck...</i>

15:48.272 --> 15:50.775

<i>And you are the best
negotiator they've got?</i>

16:18.386 --> 16:20.221
I am one of their negotiators, yes.

16:22.348 --> 16:26.227
<i>They went on and on
about how hot you are,</i>

16:26.727 --> 16:28.396
<i>but I've seen better.</i>

16:28.562 --> 16:31.065
<i>What are your measurements?</i>

16:31.565 --> 16:36.278
You know, like in beauty pageants.

16:36.362 --> 16:38.948
Chest, waist, hips...

16:40.741 --> 16:41.741
Where'd he go?

16:42.410 --> 16:43.410
We lost the call?

16:44.161 --> 16:46.789
What happened? Did he hang up?

16:47.164 --> 16:48.708
I did, sir.

16:48.958 --> 16:49.958
What?

16:51.127 --> 16:51.836
Come on.

16:52.003 --> 16:53.421
What are you doing?

16:53.462 --> 16:55.047
Inspector Ha, are you serious?

16:55.089 --> 16:58.050
He'll call back,

16:58.134 --> 17:01.554
but I need to know what's going
on to respond to the situation.

17:01.762 --> 17:03.556
Goddammit...

17:06.392 --> 17:07.977
Sergeant, he's calling again.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.229
Connect the call.

17:10.271 --> 17:11.896
I'll explain everything later.

17:12.022 --> 17:14.942
Don't pick up. We can't let
him lead negotiations.

17:14.983 --> 17:15.526
Hold. Hold.

17:15.568 --> 17:18.404
We will explain later.
Now, pick up the call!

17:27.454 --> 17:29.623
What the hell...

17:35.421 --> 17:40.301
Hello. I need to sort some things out, so
please call back in a little while. Thank you.

17:43.012 --> 17:44.096
<i>She hung up again.</i>

17:48.434 --> 17:49.852
For fuck's sake!

17:51.270 --> 17:53.022
Please tell me what's going on.

17:56.984 --> 17:58.110
He's calling again.

18:01.155 --> 18:02.198
Chief Han!

18:03.199 --> 18:04.700
You take it.

18:08.954 --> 18:09.954
Me?

18:10.039 --> 18:11.039
Do it!

18:12.041 --> 18:13.250
Shit...

18:23.594 --> 18:24.804
Hello,

18:25.429 --> 18:28.224
I am Han Young-sook, Seoul Police

Captain Jung?

18:43.656 --> 18:46.200
<i>- Bring me that.
</i>- What's he doing there?

18:48.411 --> 18:51.580
<i>Say hello. Up there.</i>

18:54.041 --> 18:55.418
<i>Do a peace sign.</i>

18:58.504 --> 19:00.631
<i>You think we're kidding around.</i>

19:03.092 --> 19:04.385
Mr. Min...

19:06.012 --> 19:09.015
Look, we haven't even started yet.

19:10.099 --> 19:11.100
We haven't...

19:11.225 --> 19:12.351
Mr. Min!

19:19.483 --> 19:23.988
<i>It's your lucky day, Captain Jung!</i>

19:35.541 --> 19:36.667
Get ready.

19:37.501 --> 19:38.502
Mr. Min,

19:38.711 --> 19:41.005
can we talk now?

19:41.964 --> 19:43.966
<i>- The fuck? Is it broken?</i>
- Mr. Min?

19:50.306 --> 19:55.186
<i>Hanging up like that is rude.
No matter how busy you are.</i>

19:57.813 --> 19:58.898
I apologize,

19:59.607 --> 20:04.028
but how about extending
us some manners too?

20:05.321 --> 20:08.407
<i>I'm not sure you're in a
position to demand manners.</i>

20:13.704 --> 20:17.833
165, 34, 24, 35.

20:18.751 --> 20:19.794
To answer your question.

20:19.835 --> 20:22.463
<i>Right, the measurements!</i>

20:24.006 --> 20:26.634
<i>You don't look it.</i>

20:26.926 --> 20:29.637
Get a date, and go on a diet.

20:31.931 --> 20:35.935
<i>Captain Jung, I like her.</i>

20:36.394 --> 20:39.647
<i>Maybe I should just pack
it all in and ask her out.</i>

20:39.897 --> 20:41.482
I'm up for it.

20:43.192 --> 20:46.112
<i>How about a drink then? You and me?</i>

20:46.153 --> 20:51.158
Sure. Whatever you want.

20:51.200 --> 20:54.328
<i>Let's leave my demands for
later, but before that...</i>

20:54.662 --> 20:55.329
Yes.

20:55.454 --> 20:58.040
<i>Can we speak frankly?</i>

20:58.165 --> 20:59.083
Of course.

20:59.166 --> 21:00.960
<i>No lies, okay?</i>

21:01.961 --> 21:03.337
You have my word.

21:04.088 --> 21:10.344
<i>It's important you are
completely honest,</i>

21:11.262 --> 21:12.722
<i>Chae-youn. Okay?</i>

21:15.433 --> 21:16.684
Inspector Ha?

21:19.020 --> 21:20.021
<i>Chae-youn?</i>

21:20.146 --> 21:22.523
<i>What happened? Did we disconnect?</i>

21:23.357 --> 21:24.442
I'm listening.

21:24.650 --> 21:27.653
<i>Were you scared just then?</i>

21:28.279 --> 21:32.700
Could you put the gun away?

21:33.034 --> 21:37.705
I don't think we can have a frank
conversation in this atmosphere.

21:38.205 --> 21:42.918
<i>And what if we can't? Just
going to give up on him?</i>

21:45.421 --> 21:48.341
Give me the chance not to give up.

21:48.799 --> 21:54.013
The chance not to give up.
I like that.

21:55.848 --> 21:58.601
<i>Okay, tell me who is watching us.</i>

21:58.809 --> 22:00.644
Put the gun away, and I'll tell you.

22:01.354 --> 22:05.649
<i>Seems studying abroad paid off for you.
You're good at the basics.</i>

22:10.946 --> 22:13.741
<i>Chief Han of Foreign Investigations.</i>

22:13.783 --> 22:15.910
<i>Oh, the old lady? Okay.</i>

22:16.494 --> 22:19.205
Police Commissioner Moon Jong-hyuk.

22:19.246 --> 22:20.246
<i>And?</i>

22:20.456 --> 22:23.000
Several agents monitoring the screens.

22:23.167 --> 22:25.127
Some officers I don't know.

22:25.336 --> 22:27.171
No one else higher up?

22:31.759 --> 22:33.279
<i>Don't tell him Secretary Gong is here.</i>

22:35.346 --> 22:37.807
Nobody higher than the commissioner.

22:37.848 --> 22:40.685
The commissioner has command.

22:46.857 --> 22:49.068
<i>- Chae-youn.
</i>- Yes.

22:49.318 --> 22:50.528
Look at me.

22:53.030 --> 22:56.784
<i>We can't get to know each other
if you tell lies. You get that, right?</i>

22:57.326 --> 22:58.994
Yes. Of course.

23:00.454 --> 23:02.832
<i>Okay. I'll trust you then.</i>

23:03.874 --> 23:05.001
Thank you.

23:06.460 --> 23:08.838
Are there other...

23:08.879 --> 23:10.589
<i>Is the food ready?</i>

23:11.841 --> 23:15.594
<i>Chae-youn, we have to eat,
so let's end the intros.</i>

23:15.636 --> 23:17.221
<i>I'll talk to you soon.</i>

23:17.805 --> 23:20.808
If you have demands, tell us now.

23:20.891 --> 23:22.643
We need time to prepare.

23:22.685 --> 23:26.188
<i>You can't handle that right now.</i>

23:27.106 --> 23:28.106
<i>Oh!</i>

23:28.149 --> 23:30.609
<i>You haven't said hello to Captain Jung.</i>

23:41.454 --> 23:43.414
Sir, are you okay?

23:45.041 --> 23:46.792
<i>You weren't told a thing, right?</i>

23:47.668 --> 23:48.668
Yes.

23:49.295 --> 23:51.714
<i>Inspector Ha, from here on you have to</i>

23:51.839 --> 23:55.051
<i>handle the situation by the book.</i>

23:55.217 --> 23:56.594
<i>Step by step. All right?</i>

23:57.762 --> 24:01.390
Don't worry. Everything will be okay.

24:02.641 --> 24:04.352
<i>By the book. Like in the field.</i>

24:04.393 --> 24:07.396
<i>Okay. That's it.</i>

24:09.231 --> 24:14.028
<i>Remember, complete honesty.
We'll talk soon. Bye.</i>

24:26.832 --> 24:30.211
Reporter Lee was following
a lead on crimes against

24:30.252 --> 24:33.172
Koreans in Southeast Asia when
he was abducted a week ago.

24:33.756 --> 24:36.217
Min Tae-gu is the kidnappers' boss.

24:37.885 --> 24:39.929
From Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok,

24:39.970 --> 24:45.267
he leads an international gang
that has a hand in everything dirty.

24:45.434 --> 24:48.229
It's the most vicious Korean gang,

24:48.354 --> 24:51.399
so they are high on our blacklist.

24:52.316 --> 24:54.443
Three days ago, Daehan
Daily's officials

24:54.485 --> 24:59.532
went to Bangkok with Captain
Jung as the negotiator.

24:59.657 --> 25:01.784
Min Tae-gu intercepted them,

25:04.954 --> 25:07.957
and Jung was kidnapped on the
way to the rendezvous point.

25:08.207 --> 25:10.543
They don't seem to be
interested in negotiating.

25:10.751 --> 25:12.378
Those sons of bitches...

25:13.504 --> 25:16.757
They contacted us just recently.

25:16.799 --> 25:17.799
Hit play.

25:20.302 --> 25:24.056
<i>I now have two cards.
A reporter and a cop.</i>

25:24.640 --> 25:28.978
<i>I am wondering what I
should do with the cards.</i>

25:30.021 --> 25:30.604
<i>Your side</i>

25:30.646 --> 25:32.440
<i>- should have a think.
</i>- Pause.

25:33.899 --> 25:35.901
This morning, after three days,

25:36.652 --> 25:40.656
they called back, showing us Captain Jung
and saying they wanted Inspector Ha.

25:43.576 --> 25:45.536
The media doesn't know yet.

25:45.745 --> 25:48.330
We asked Daehan Daily
to maintain an embargo.

25:48.998 --> 25:53.210
The presidential office feels
uncomfortable about the whole thing.

25:56.172 --> 26:01.677
Not so much uncomfortable as
concerned for our oversea Koreans.

26:02.053 --> 26:02.762
But what's more,

26:02.845 --> 26:06.307
a police officer being taken
is a very serious matter.

26:07.808 --> 26:11.312
We've sent in the Special Air Force
as a joint police-military op.

26:11.520 --> 26:12.772
SART.

26:13.105 --> 26:17.109
The area is plagued by pirates
and the Philippines' rebel militia.

26:17.234 --> 26:20.613
So Thai, Malay, and Indonesian
authorities have little control.

26:20.780 --> 26:24.283
Min's gang is holding the
hostages on this island.

26:24.325 --> 26:26.160
It's officially Thai territory.

26:26.327 --> 26:30.831
We will launch a rescue operation
with Thai government support.

26:31.874 --> 26:33.668
If we can buy time,

26:34.085 --> 26:36.671
the special forces can move in.

26:36.837 --> 26:38.089
Do you see what we're saying?

26:40.883 --> 26:43.719
How much time?

26:44.178 --> 26:47.390
They'll move in at 10 p.m. local time.

26:47.431 --> 26:49.141
That's midnight Korea time.

26:49.266 --> 26:53.604
It's 10 now so you have 14 hours.

26:55.898 --> 27:00.152
The president is very
concerned about this, okay?

27:00.861 --> 27:03.781
It's an overseas military op.

27:03.906 --> 27:06.617
We had to get Thai government support,

27:06.826 --> 27:09.662
as well as help from US recon assets.

27:10.371 --> 27:13.082
It was not easy.

27:13.582 --> 27:15.876
Can you do it?

27:18.963 --> 27:20.464
You can do it, Ha Chae-youn!

27:20.756 --> 27:22.216
For God's sake, man.

27:27.972 --> 27:30.474
Please call in my team.

27:40.234 --> 27:45.197
<i>Indian Ocean, 14 hours to operation</i>

27:45.448 --> 27:46.448
Listen up!

27:48.743 --> 27:50.953
We touch down at the Thai
navy base in three hours.

27:51.037 --> 27:52.747
We stay there till sundown.

27:52.788 --> 27:55.041
We will be transported
by ship to the island.

27:55.082 --> 27:58.252
H-hour is 2200 local time.

27:58.377 --> 27:59.962
Operation code name, Shadow.

28:00.212 --> 28:02.423
Sync watches. 0805.

28:02.465 --> 28:03.215
Three.

28:03.299 --> 28:04.091
Two.

28:04.175 --> 28:05.175
Sync.

28:08.012 --> 28:09.096
Take a look.

28:10.431 --> 28:12.391
Min is a foreign citizen.

28:12.850 --> 28:13.851
Yeah?

28:13.976 --> 28:16.979
He received UK citizenship last year.

28:17.146 --> 28:18.814
Richard Min.

28:19.106 --> 28:22.526
He obtained it through the UK's
immigrant investment program.

28:22.818 --> 28:26.947
Some bastards are quick when
it comes to things like this.

28:29.325 --> 28:32.119
No information about family.

28:32.703 --> 28:36.707
He's an orphan, has been
abroad since an early age.

28:36.957 --> 28:39.126
So there's little info on him.

28:41.629 --> 28:46.008
Who are these people behind him?

28:46.217 --> 28:48.719
Oversea Koreans he met.

28:48.928 --> 28:50.888
We only know they are Korean.

28:51.972 --> 28:53.849
Bloody hell...

28:54.308 --> 28:56.602
It does look like a hostage situation.

28:57.269 --> 29:00.272
And not a non-hostage.

29:00.439 --> 29:01.439
What do you mean?

29:01.524 --> 29:08.280
A hostage situation is using hostages
to get what you want.

29:08.447 --> 29:11.367
In a non-hostage situation,
assailants are just venting anger.

29:15.329 --> 29:16.372
They're calling.

29:23.879 --> 29:27.508
We aren't supposed to wear
uniforms in negotiations.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.428
I'll take it for you.

29:33.973 --> 29:36.100
Did you enjoy your meal?

29:36.809 --> 29:38.519
<i>Yeah, thanks to you.</i>

29:38.936 --> 29:41.564
Where is Captain Jung?

29:41.647 --> 29:44.400
<i>What do you look for in a man?</i>

29:44.817 --> 29:48.237
<i>You know, looks, money, personality...</i>

29:49.238 --> 29:51.991
I like honest men, like you.

29:52.116 --> 29:55.953
<i>Like me? How do you know I'm honest?</i>

29:55.995 --> 29:59.457
I've been told I have a gift.

30:02.043 --> 30:06.714
<i>What kind of ending do you
think this will have?</i>

30:07.173 --> 30:08.507
A happy ending.

30:09.216 --> 30:10.426
<i>A happy ending?</i>

30:13.179 --> 30:15.306
<i>I don't think so.</i>

30:20.936 --> 30:22.438
I do

30:23.397 --> 30:26.984
because you're not a fool.

30:30.905 --> 30:33.657
<i>I have someone I want to
see. Could you call him in?</i>

30:33.741 --> 30:37.870
Before that, may I see Captain Jung?

30:38.037 --> 30:42.500
<i>Sure, why not? Let's say hi.</i>

30:42.667 --> 30:43.709
<i>Bring it.</i>

30:54.970 --> 30:56.430
Captain, are you okay?

30:58.057 --> 30:59.225
<i>Inspector Ha...</i>

30:59.600 --> 31:00.851
<i>Inspector Ha...</i>

31:02.061 --> 31:03.521
<i>How much did you give him?</i>

31:03.813 --> 31:05.815
<i>About 50 milliliters.</i>

31:07.817 --> 31:11.696
Didn't I say that much can kill him?

31:13.447 --> 31:14.657
Sorry...

31:16.492 --> 31:22.498
<i>Captain Jung was having trouble
relaxing, so I gave him something.</i>

31:23.332 --> 31:25.793
<i>He'll be okay. Don't worry.</i>

31:26.585 --> 31:27.837
<i>Captain Jung...</i>

31:28.754 --> 31:29.754
<i>Jung!</i>

31:30.589 --> 31:31.589
Jung!

31:33.426 --> 31:34.719
Is he dead?

31:34.760 --> 31:35.845
Jung!

31:36.971 --> 31:38.180
<i>Jung!</i>

31:40.683 --> 31:41.809
Mr. Min!

31:48.107 --> 31:49.608
Please, don't hit him.

31:50.651 --> 31:52.153
What's this?

31:52.737 --> 31:54.655
Are you two going out?

31:56.282 --> 31:58.117
Is that how it is?

31:58.451 --> 32:04.707
If you carry on like this, I won't
have the room to deal with you.

32:06.208 --> 32:07.293
<i>Put it back.</i>

32:13.382 --> 32:14.592
<i>What room?</i>

32:15.718 --> 32:19.347
Here. This will shut itself up.

32:21.474 --> 32:25.770
I am the only channel you
have to get what you want.

32:26.103 --> 32:29.231
<i>I haven't told you what I want.</i>

32:29.273 --> 32:32.485
So tell me now.

32:32.526 --> 32:34.403
<i>CEO of Daehan Daily,
Yoon Dong-hoon.</i>

32:35.654 --> 32:36.947
<i>I'll give you one hour.</i>

32:38.115 --> 32:40.659
First, we need to know
reporter Lee is still alive.

32:40.701 --> 32:44.038
<i>Come on, what kind of deal is that?.</i>

32:44.080 --> 32:48.376
I need something to convince
my superiors. Give me something.

32:48.668 --> 32:49.794
<i>One hour.</i>

32:50.920 --> 32:54.465
Hold on! We don't know where he is.

32:54.590 --> 32:56.842
It's impossible with Seoul traffic.

32:59.595 --> 33:01.013
<i>Send a chopper.</i>

33:05.768 --> 33:08.896
<i>CEO of Daehan Daily,
Yoon Dong-hoon</i>

33:14.360 --> 33:15.360
He's here.

33:16.612 --> 33:17.780
Mr. Yoon Dong-hoon?

33:18.197 --> 33:18.698
Yes.

33:18.781 --> 33:20.741
I'm Commissioner Moon Jong-hyuk.

33:20.866 --> 33:22.618
Were you briefed on the way?

33:23.202 --> 33:24.370
Yes, yes...

33:24.912 --> 33:27.581
You just need to talk to him
and follow our instructions.

33:27.623 --> 33:28.457
Yes, okay.

33:28.499 --> 33:30.084
Ha Chae-youn, Crisis negotiation Team.

33:30.126 --> 33:32.086
I'm Yoon Dong-hoon.

33:32.211 --> 33:33.629
Thank you for coming.

33:33.713 --> 33:35.297
This way.

33:35.339 --> 33:35.965
Okay.

33:36.007 --> 33:37.007
Excuse me, but

33:37.425 --> 33:39.593
could you change your clothes?

33:46.642 --> 33:48.519
Sit there.

33:55.693 --> 33:58.279
Take off the jacket.

33:58.320 --> 33:59.405
Just the shirt.

33:59.780 --> 34:00.573
I'll take it.

34:00.740 --> 34:01.824
He's calling!

34:03.909 --> 34:07.163
Don't worry, we will support
you through the earpiece.

34:07.204 --> 34:08.831
If you get stuck, look at me.

34:21.427 --> 34:22.553
<i>Mr. Yoon Dong-hoon?</i>

34:22.762 --> 34:23.888
Yes, I am Yoon Dong-hoon.

34:23.929 --> 34:26.014
<i>You look younger than the photos.</i>

34:28.516 --> 34:29.810
<i>You look tense.</i>

34:30.143 --> 34:31.353
<i>Say thank you.</i>

34:31.853 --> 34:35.024
No, I'm okay. Thank you.

34:35.065 --> 34:37.318
<i>No need for that.</i>

34:38.485 --> 34:40.112
<i>Hey, bring over the reporter.</i>

34:40.321 --> 34:42.989
<i>No, both of them.</i>

34:51.873 --> 34:54.001
Ask how reporter Lee is first.

34:54.460 --> 34:57.129
Lee, are you okay?

35:03.844 --> 35:04.844
Yes,

35:05.888 --> 35:07.640
I'm fine, sir.

35:08.307 --> 35:12.353
Hang in there. It'll be okay.

35:12.770 --> 35:14.146
Thank you, sir.

35:15.690 --> 35:17.817
Such good rapport.

35:18.567 --> 35:19.985
<i>Mr. Yoon,</i>

35:20.111 --> 35:22.947
there were no stories about
Lee's abduction in Daehan Daily.

35:23.322 --> 35:29.620
Police requested an embargo,
so we have been careful.

35:29.954 --> 35:33.040
Tell him Lee's safety is priority.

35:33.207 --> 35:38.838
But Lee's safety is more
important than some story.

35:39.005 --> 35:44.385
<i>Yes, of course. Are you two close?</i>

35:44.593 --> 35:47.638
Yes, I meet with him now and then.

35:47.805 --> 35:48.889
<i>Had a drink or two?</i>

35:48.931 --> 35:50.433
Yes, that's right.

35:57.565 --> 36:00.067
<i>What were Lee's exclusives?</i>

36:00.609 --> 36:03.487
Um... June 2014,

36:04.488 --> 36:08.325
a story about military service
being recognized for college points,

36:08.576 --> 36:12.538
and in 2015, one about a Jeju kindergarten.

36:12.997 --> 36:15.166
About a family that died there.

36:15.291 --> 36:20.046
You are smart. You remember all that?

36:20.421 --> 36:27.011
I read his files because of this incident.

36:27.053 --> 36:30.514
You didn't just read it, you memorized it.

36:31.766 --> 36:35.478
You'd think someone prepped
you for being asked about it.

36:40.858 --> 36:43.277
<i>What about his family?</i>

36:44.236 --> 36:48.949
Wife and a school-aged daughter.

36:50.201 --> 36:52.161
You have a good boss, Mr. Lee.

36:52.536 --> 36:53.996
He knows everything.

36:55.831 --> 36:57.750
How much does he drink?

36:59.001 --> 37:00.001
Drink?

37:00.628 --> 37:01.796
<i>Did you not hear me?</i>

37:01.921 --> 37:02.338
Drink...

37:02.380 --> 37:05.216
How much can he drink?

37:05.591 --> 37:10.346
I... I don't like drinking.

37:10.388 --> 37:14.350
You said you drank with him,
but you can't answer my question?

37:14.475 --> 37:18.604
I always leave early.

37:32.785 --> 37:35.621
<i>Okay, Mr. Leave Early, stand up.</i>

37:35.996 --> 37:36.539
Sorry?

37:36.706 --> 37:38.290
<i>Stand up.</i>

37:38.332 --> 37:39.332
Okay, okay.

37:42.878 --> 37:43.629
Take a step back,

37:43.671 --> 37:45.047
<i>so I can see your whole body.</i>

37:45.089 --> 37:47.466
- Okay.
<i>- Back, back, back, back...</i>

37:47.508 --> 37:48.509
<i>Stop.</i>

37:49.385 --> 37:51.178
What are you wearing?

37:51.512 --> 37:52.722
It's...

37:53.389 --> 37:57.435
You were out golfing while one of
your men was being held hostage.

37:57.560 --> 37:59.353
<i>Tell him it was a prior engagement.</i>

37:59.395 --> 38:03.357
It was arranged before. I'm sorry.

38:03.399 --> 38:05.735
Lee is not one of yours, is he?

38:06.527 --> 38:08.195
Sorry? What do you mean?

38:08.237 --> 38:09.697
<i>Be honest,</i>

38:10.406 --> 38:12.158
or your life gets very complicated.

38:13.325 --> 38:17.371
Your wife is Baek Hee-kyung.
Your daughter, Yoon Ju-ri, is in the US.

38:17.413 --> 38:19.853
<i>Your second child, Yoon Ju-seung,
studies at Korea University.</i>

38:20.249 --> 38:21.249
<i>Right?</i>

38:22.043 --> 38:24.920
<i>I'm Commissioner Moon Jong-hyuk.</i>

38:26.505 --> 38:29.175
Talk to me. I am in charge.

38:29.216 --> 38:32.178
<i>You stay out of it for now.</i>

38:32.428 --> 38:34.055
What are your demands?

38:34.597 --> 38:39.393
You'll come in when I tell you to.

38:39.477 --> 38:42.855
We are ready to talk
with all options open.

38:42.897 --> 38:45.983
Fuck... I said stay out!

38:46.275 --> 38:48.194
How many times did I say that?!

38:48.652 --> 38:51.614
<i>We are talking. Can't you see?</i>

38:52.490 --> 38:56.035
You think I'm a fucking
joke, don't you? You fuck!

39:06.879 --> 39:12.468
I'm sorry. Things get rough
when I lose my cool.

39:12.593 --> 39:14.970
It's hard to change.

39:15.137 --> 39:16.263
All right.

39:20.810 --> 39:21.810
Mr. Yoon?

39:22.436 --> 39:23.479
Yes.

39:24.939 --> 39:28.818
Lee is not with Daehan Daily, is he?

39:34.240 --> 39:37.535
I will ask one last time.

39:38.035 --> 39:40.538
Is he or isn't he one of yours?

39:40.663 --> 39:41.747
Please, put the gun away!

39:41.789 --> 39:43.874
You can't solve anything like that!

39:44.333 --> 39:47.211
Should I bring your wife
and kids into this?

39:49.505 --> 39:50.631
Mr. Min,

39:50.965 --> 39:52.633
there must be some misunderstanding.

39:52.675 --> 39:53.718
Answer me, Yoon Dong-hoon.

39:53.759 --> 39:57.471
Inspector Ha! Take Mr. Yoon out. Now!

39:57.930 --> 40:00.016
Mr. Yoon is too taken aback.

40:06.022 --> 40:08.649
Three seconds, or it's his head.

40:08.691 --> 40:09.942
One, two...

40:10.109 --> 40:11.110
He is not!

40:38.346 --> 40:39.513
<i>Chae-youn?</i>

40:41.015 --> 40:42.308
Take a seat.

40:50.483 --> 40:54.904
We said no lies, didn't we?

40:56.280 --> 40:57.531
I didn't know.

40:57.615 --> 41:00.826
But you caught on. Even I did.

41:01.744 --> 41:04.413
I really didn't know.

41:04.455 --> 41:06.499
Shut up, you bitch.

41:08.084 --> 41:10.878
What did I say will happen if you lie?

41:13.631 --> 41:14.340
Tae-gu...

41:14.382 --> 41:17.885
I said complete honesty.

41:19.762 --> 41:20.888
Mr. Min...

41:42.618 --> 41:44.370
<i>Get rid of him.</i>

41:45.329 --> 41:46.956
Fuck.

41:49.291 --> 41:50.876
<i>It's all over me.</i>

41:51.794 --> 41:53.921
Crazy bastard...

41:56.215 --> 41:56.882
<i>What?</i>

41:56.924 --> 41:59.760
Crazy bastard!

42:00.553 --> 42:02.638
<i>Are you swearing at me?</i>

42:02.680 --> 42:04.015
Hang up! Hang up!

42:11.689 --> 42:13.607
You son of a bitch!

42:16.235 --> 42:18.362
Crazy bastard...

42:28.998 --> 42:30.416
<i>Thai airspace, T-9 to H-hour</i>

42:30.458 --> 42:33.586
<i>Eagle one, this is the nest.
Dove two has been killed.</i>

42:33.627 --> 42:36.213
<i>Change of plans, I repeat.</i>

42:36.922 --> 42:38.049
Change of plans.

42:38.215 --> 42:41.135
We infiltrate from the sea.

42:41.302 --> 42:42.302
Gear up.

42:42.386 --> 42:43.386
Gear up!

42:46.057 --> 42:47.600
Who is Lee Sang-mok?

42:49.643 --> 42:51.604
- I'll tell you later.
- Later when?

42:51.854 --> 42:53.522
When everyone's dead?

42:53.606 --> 42:54.606
Inspector Ha!

42:57.401 --> 42:58.527
A call's coming in.

42:58.986 --> 42:59.862
Get ready.

42:59.904 --> 43:01.238
Do not connect!

43:04.825 --> 43:06.160
You knew, right?

43:06.827 --> 43:10.790
You both knew he is not a reporter.

43:11.665 --> 43:13.042
Who is he?

43:14.043 --> 43:16.504
Why aren't you telling me
who Lee Sang-mok is?

43:16.545 --> 43:17.797
Inspector Ha!

43:19.924 --> 43:22.968
From now on, they will handle Min.

43:26.514 --> 43:27.598
No.

43:28.224 --> 43:29.225
Take her away.

43:31.143 --> 43:32.311
Commissioner,

43:33.938 --> 43:36.065
Captain Jung is dead.

43:36.107 --> 43:38.192
You're not the only one who saw that!

43:38.943 --> 43:40.611
You're not the only one suffering!

43:41.237 --> 43:42.905
Take her away, now.

43:45.074 --> 43:46.074
Let's go.

43:53.332 --> 43:54.375
Come on.

43:59.505 --> 44:02.758
Anyone not involved, please leave.

44:05.469 --> 44:06.178
Me too?

44:06.303 --> 44:07.013
Yes.

44:07.263 --> 44:08.973
We're taking over.

44:12.810 --> 44:13.810
Sorry, but...

44:14.478 --> 44:16.522
what is going on here?

44:17.023 --> 44:18.357
Commissioner!

44:37.251 --> 44:38.251
What's going on?

44:40.546 --> 44:42.089
Can I get one?

44:42.882 --> 44:44.008
Here you go.

44:44.175 --> 44:45.301
Thanks.

44:54.560 --> 44:57.772
Lee is a black agent from the
National Intelligence Service.

44:58.272 --> 45:00.733
He was sent to spy on Min's gang.

45:02.485 --> 45:06.614
Is Min a North Korean spy?

45:07.907 --> 45:09.158
He's an arms dealer.

45:10.076 --> 45:12.495
He sells to pirates in the Malacca Straits.

45:12.536 --> 45:16.415
Everything from machine guns and RPGs
to booby traps and body armor.

45:16.624 --> 45:18.626
NIS found out,

45:19.001 --> 45:22.129
sent Lee in undercover.

45:22.963 --> 45:24.799
Why didn't you tell us that?

45:27.593 --> 45:29.720
To keep it from Min.

45:30.513 --> 45:32.932
You being unaware seemed better

45:33.140 --> 45:37.978
for buying time and keeping Min calm.

45:39.563 --> 45:41.816
What does he want?

45:42.149 --> 45:43.776
We don't know.

45:45.236 --> 45:48.656
Maybe he planned on doing that
to Jung from the very start.

45:49.240 --> 45:52.827
Nobody blames you.
You did the best you could.

46:12.596 --> 46:14.390
Sorry, I'm late.

46:16.851 --> 46:17.977
Inspector.

46:18.602 --> 46:22.773
It isn't over. There are more hostages.

46:23.315 --> 46:24.900
We need to stop him.

46:25.735 --> 46:29.071
Let's get that bastard ourselves.

46:32.450 --> 46:36.162
How? He's in Thailand.
We're not Interpol.

46:38.205 --> 46:41.542
Get info on arms trade
in Southeast Asia.

46:41.751 --> 46:43.836
Anything linked to Min Tae-gu.

46:44.086 --> 46:44.962
Hurry.

46:45.004 --> 46:46.213
- Yes.
- Yes.

46:48.090 --> 46:49.091
And you,

46:49.133 --> 46:52.386
go see Yoon. Something will come up.

46:53.179 --> 46:54.347
Inspector Ha...

46:54.972 --> 46:55.973
Ha Chae-youn.

46:57.558 --> 46:59.602
If we do it like this, you might...

46:59.685 --> 47:03.481
And let Jung die for nothing?

47:12.156 --> 47:16.702
Fine, fine. I'll let you know.

47:17.036 --> 47:18.036
Okay.

47:26.128 --> 47:27.128
<i>Who...</i>

47:27.546 --> 47:31.801
Hello, I'm NIS agent Choi Chun-jung.

47:32.009 --> 47:33.344
Park Kyoung-mook.

47:33.761 --> 47:37.181
<i>NIS? Where are the police?</i>

47:37.306 --> 47:38.933
<i>Why is NIS here?</i>

47:39.392 --> 47:43.187
Mr. Min, let's cut the bullshit.

47:43.270 --> 47:47.149
We're all professionals. Let's talk.

47:47.608 --> 47:50.736
Lee is an NIS agent.

47:50.986 --> 47:52.196
You knew, right?

47:52.363 --> 47:55.199
<i>Is that so?</i>

47:55.783 --> 48:00.913
A simple mistake could bring
the entire NIS down on you.

48:01.038 --> 48:04.250
I am so scared.

48:09.755 --> 48:12.675
Release Agent Lee.

48:12.717 --> 48:15.803
<i>How can I just let him go?</i>

48:15.845 --> 48:17.430
Shangri-La Mountain.

48:17.763 --> 48:19.140
It's all about that, right?

48:19.557 --> 48:22.059
You're the president, aren't you?

48:23.769 --> 48:28.524
<i>NIS is so much better than the cops.</i>

48:30.234 --> 48:35.114
<i>But Shangri-La, that's a UK firm.
How does it concern you people?</i>

48:35.156 --> 48:38.034
<i>Why is the NIS involved?</i>

48:38.075 --> 48:40.077
<i>I'm a foreigner.</i>

48:40.327 --> 48:43.080
Because Korean weapons
are being traded.

48:43.330 --> 48:45.958
Agent Lee went to gather intel.

48:46.208 --> 48:49.211
<i>So what does the NIS want?</i>

48:49.879 --> 48:52.131
Let's make a deal.

48:52.340 --> 48:53.340
<i>A deal?</i>

48:53.382 --> 48:56.218
Release Lee, stop selling weapons,

48:56.260 --> 48:58.971
and hand over all information.

48:59.180 --> 49:01.599
Then, we will forget about your past.

49:02.350 --> 49:07.813
<i>You mean, give up everything and
be an NIS snitch, then I get to live.</i>

49:07.855 --> 49:09.315
<i>Is that about right?</i>

49:09.357 --> 49:13.944
Let's avoid a bad situation.

49:35.466 --> 49:36.801
<i>Fuck you.</i>

49:42.556 --> 49:44.558
<i>Don't waste your time.</i>

49:44.600 --> 49:49.313
<i>Bring me Inspector Ha.
I want to deal with her.</i>

49:49.772 --> 49:53.859
You think we're fucking around here?!

49:53.901 --> 49:55.736
<i>Shut up.</i>

49:56.237 --> 49:59.115
If I was scared of you, I never
would have started this.

50:00.533 --> 50:01.533
Bring him.

50:01.617 --> 50:03.494
Mercenaries called Deadpol,

50:03.577 --> 50:05.121
and Min was something else.

50:05.204 --> 50:08.332
Iraq, Libya, Philippines, Lithuania...

50:08.457 --> 50:10.292
He was all over the place.

50:10.626 --> 50:14.755
Then he disappeared five years ago.

50:15.548 --> 50:19.093
He's heavily linked to Korean
weapons trade in Southeast Asia.

50:19.719 --> 50:23.431
How did a foreign mercenary
get hold of Korean weapons?

50:24.265 --> 50:27.101
It's not just a few
stolen weapons either.

50:34.817 --> 50:36.861
Pack up. Let's go.

50:37.445 --> 50:38.445
Where?

50:39.822 --> 50:41.198
To ask him in person.

50:47.371 --> 50:48.414
<i>See,</i>

50:49.582 --> 50:50.666
what will you do?

50:52.418 --> 50:55.046
If I blow his head off now,
what will you do?

50:55.087 --> 50:56.339
<i>We'll kill you.</i>

50:56.380 --> 50:58.049
Will you fire a missile or something?

50:58.090 --> 51:00.217
<i>What? You think we won't?</i>

51:00.259 --> 51:03.971
You've got something up
your sleeve, don't you?

51:04.513 --> 51:07.600
We can give up Agent Lee,

51:07.892 --> 51:09.352
<i>but you're going down too.</i>

51:09.894 --> 51:12.146
Well, fuck...

51:14.023 --> 51:15.024
Bring them in.

51:26.494 --> 51:27.703
Say hello.

51:30.956 --> 51:31.999
You can't talk?

51:35.419 --> 51:36.545
<i>Hello.</i>

51:37.963 --> 51:40.216
They are NIS.

51:42.635 --> 51:44.011
Cho-rong.

51:45.429 --> 51:47.431
It's okay. Come here.

51:48.349 --> 51:49.725
No, No!

51:50.017 --> 51:51.727
Let's go have a chat.

51:52.520 --> 51:53.688
It's okay.

51:57.400 --> 52:00.361
<i>What's your favorite song?</i>

52:00.653 --> 52:01.987
It's okay, you can talk.

52:06.283 --> 52:07.284
"Elephant"

52:07.576 --> 52:08.828
"Elephant"

52:13.332 --> 52:15.334
Come on then, sing.

52:19.005 --> 52:20.172

<i>Go to your mother.</i>

53:48.135 --> 53:49.804
Good girl.

53:50.763 --> 53:52.264
What are you doing?

53:52.306 --> 53:57.353
<i>I'm showing a few more
of my hidden cards.</i>

53:57.937 --> 54:00.773
Now, I don't need Lee Sang-mok.

54:02.400 --> 54:05.111
<i>Hey, Tae-gu...</i>

54:07.905 --> 54:10.533
What? Don't kill him?

54:12.410 --> 54:19.917
<i>Bring me Inspector Ha,
or Lee loses his head.</i>

54:19.959 --> 54:20.960
<i>Get it?</i>

54:21.752 --> 54:23.838
<i>Chae-youn, do you see?</i>

54:23.879 --> 54:24.797
You...

54:24.880 --> 54:25.880
<i>Min Tae-gu...</i>

54:28.718 --> 54:29.718
<i>It's okay.</i>

54:29.760 --> 54:30.678
<i>It's okay.</i>

54:30.761 --> 54:31.846
<i>Half an hour.</i>

54:33.639 --> 54:38.352
<i>If she's not here by
then, we kill Lee.</i>

54:38.561 --> 54:39.561
<i>Okay?</i>

54:44.692 --> 54:46.402
Why isn't she picking up?

54:47.695 --> 54:51.073
People will die! Let me go!

54:54.660 --> 54:56.120
<i>Malacca Straits, T-4 hours</i>

54:56.203 --> 54:59.331
Three! Two! One! Go!

55:26.901 --> 55:30.196
Looks like a family on vacation.
He's even holding children.

55:30.613 --> 55:31.405
Kids?

55:31.530 --> 55:32.573
Brother and sister.

55:40.164 --> 55:42.375
Inspector Ha, come in.

55:43.084 --> 55:44.085
Min Tae-gu is now...

55:44.126 --> 55:45.711
Give me everything.

55:46.921 --> 55:47.463
What?

55:47.505 --> 55:50.758
I want all the intel on Min and Lee,

55:50.841 --> 55:53.552
and anything else you've got.

55:58.474 --> 56:00.518
Okay.

56:00.643 --> 56:04.105
Min only deals with me from here on.

56:07.900 --> 56:08.900
Fine.

56:10.611 --> 56:11.612
This way.

56:15.032 --> 56:19.412
Stay out. I won't let anyone in.

56:20.246 --> 56:22.164
You will need our help.

56:22.915 --> 56:26.293
I told you to share everything.

56:28.921 --> 56:30.006
Call coming in.

56:34.927 --> 56:36.053
Everyone out.

56:41.434 --> 56:42.560
Umm...

56:58.325 --> 56:59.493
<i>You must be busy.</i>

56:59.744 --> 57:01.328
<i>I waited for so long.</i>

57:01.454 --> 57:02.872
I went out to eat.

57:04.957 --> 57:08.002
<i>Sure. Everyone's gotta eat, even
when their colleagues are dying.</i>

57:08.044 --> 57:13.591
Yes, but there are still
people who can be saved.

57:16.344 --> 57:19.847
Were you upset by Jung's death?

57:22.641 --> 57:28.564
He died because of me,
because of my ineptitude.

57:28.898 --> 57:32.568
Come on, you're making me feel bad.

57:32.777 --> 57:35.821
I missed something important.

57:36.113 --> 57:37.113
And that is?

57:37.490 --> 57:39.408
The reasons you're doing this.

57:40.576 --> 57:42.203
Brother...

57:51.420 --> 57:52.880
He's feeling emotional.

57:53.214 --> 57:55.466
<i>Might be because of the kids.</i>

57:56.175 --> 57:58.219
<i>Send the kids and the mom next door.</i>

57:59.428 --> 58:00.888
<i>Daddy, no!</i>

58:00.930 --> 58:03.641
<i>Please, spare their father!</i>

58:03.683 --> 58:05.935
<i>Don't worry and hush!</i>

58:07.895 --> 58:09.146
<i>Be quiet.</i>

58:11.941 --> 58:16.821
<i>Cho-rong, go with your mom. Okay?</i>

58:18.197 --> 58:19.365
<i>Good girl.</i>

58:21.450 --> 58:22.868
<i>Be gentle.</i>

58:34.338 --> 58:37.925
Were you a good kid?

58:39.176 --> 58:41.595
Any memories with your family?

58:41.971 --> 58:43.723
Parents, siblings...

58:43.764 --> 58:46.058
<i>Cut the chitchat.</i>

58:46.559 --> 58:49.395
<i>Ask me a real question.</i>

58:53.357 --> 58:56.193
Why did you bring me back here?

58:57.069 --> 58:59.780
<i>Right. You really want to know?</i>

59:00.448 --> 59:01.449
Of course.

59:03.284 --> 59:05.870
<i>Nine Electrics Chairman Koo Gwan-su.</i>

59:06.996 --> 59:08.164
<i>Get him.</i>

59:08.539 --> 59:11.625
<i>Then you will know why you are here.</i>

59:11.792 --> 59:12.793
<i>Time?</i>

59:13.544 --> 59:14.544
One hour.

59:19.467 --> 59:23.554
We expected he'd ask for Koo.

59:23.679 --> 59:26.616
On paper, Min was the president of
a company in the British Virgin Islands.

59:26.640 --> 59:29.143
A company called
Shangri-La Mountain.

59:29.643 --> 59:32.229
Koo is the man who set it up.

59:33.105 --> 59:36.567
Koo is no longer involved,
and Min is now the owner.

59:36.984 --> 59:39.820
According to intel Agent Lee sent us,

59:40.154 --> 59:43.991
funds from selling weapons to
pirates are sent to Shangri-La Mountain.

59:45.326 --> 59:49.038
At first, Koo used the company to

59:49.163 --> 59:52.917
hide the rebates from arms contracts.

59:53.584 --> 59:56.629
So, Min was Koo's man.

59:56.712 --> 59:57.922
Basically.

59:58.255 --> 01:00:02.426
Koo helped Min get UK citizenship.

01:00:02.593 --> 01:00:08.391
When Min started working
alone in the Malacca Straits,

01:00:08.516 --> 01:00:10.559
they fell out.

01:00:11.811 --> 01:00:15.731
Koo tipped off the NIS about Min

01:00:15.981 --> 01:00:18.859
<i>and reported the $50 million
he'd evaded taxes on.</i>

01:00:19.443 --> 01:00:22.196
<i>Authorities wiped his slate clean.</i>

01:00:23.072 --> 01:00:26.492
So Koo betrayed Min?

01:00:27.326 --> 01:00:30.162
<i>From Min's point of view, yes.</i>

01:00:30.788 --> 01:00:33.541
<i>We have no ulterior motives.</i>

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.668
We just want to save Agent Lee

01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:38.796
and the hostages.

01:00:39.088 --> 01:00:40.423
So do I.

01:00:42.842 --> 01:00:43.842
Okay.

01:00:44.593 --> 01:00:48.305
Where is Koo now?

01:00:48.889 --> 01:00:51.142
<i>Where do you think you are?</i>

01:00:51.976 --> 01:00:55.271
<i>Nine Electrics' weapons lab.</i>

01:00:56.105 --> 01:00:57.398
<i>The funding for the operation,</i>

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.442
<i>the location, equipment, everything</i>

01:00:59.483 --> 01:01:01.736
<i>is being provided by Koo.</i>

01:01:02.028 --> 01:01:05.197
<i>Nine Electrics Chairman
Koo Gwan-su</i>

01:01:06.657 --> 01:01:09.785
<i>NIS Deputy Chief Park In-kyu</i>

01:01:11.454 --> 01:01:14.498
<i>Commander of Air Force
Son Jung-tae</i>

01:01:16.250 --> 01:01:19.337
<i>National Security Chief
Hwang Ju-ik</i>

01:01:30.139 --> 01:01:31.515
Take a seat.

01:01:35.936 --> 01:01:37.688
You didn't have to come personally.

01:01:37.772 --> 01:01:41.108
I had a bit of time before dinner.

01:01:45.446 --> 01:01:46.781
How's it going?

01:01:47.448 --> 01:01:49.283
Min's being more
stubborn than expected.

01:01:50.493 --> 01:01:52.912
Looks like there is no other way.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.830
I will take care of it.

01:01:57.792 --> 01:01:59.627
Not much time till the operation.

01:01:59.710 --> 01:02:01.003
About four hours.

01:02:01.962 --> 01:02:03.381
Four hours.

01:02:04.382 --> 01:02:07.301
I wish I could stay until it's done.

01:02:08.552 --> 01:02:11.013
It will be done before dinner, right?

01:02:11.180 --> 01:02:13.015
Don't worry, sir.

01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:14.850
I will stay until the end.

01:02:15.142 --> 01:02:17.853
Gong is here too. No need to worry.

01:02:18.854 --> 01:02:22.066
It's okay, don't pay me any mind.

01:02:22.108 --> 01:02:24.068
It will be done soon.

01:02:32.326 --> 01:02:33.387
Get in. I'll tell you on the way.

01:02:33.411 --> 01:02:34.537
Dad...

01:02:35.538 --> 01:02:36.956
Get in.

01:02:40.209 --> 01:02:41.544
Going away?

01:02:43.671 --> 01:02:47.258
In a hurry, taking the family too.

01:02:47.842 --> 01:02:48.842
Who are you?

01:02:49.135 --> 01:02:51.429
We met earlier in the situation room.

01:02:52.096 --> 01:02:54.932
Honey, what's wrong?

01:02:55.516 --> 01:02:56.684
Oh, your wife?

01:02:56.726 --> 01:02:59.353
Hello, I met your husband earlier.

01:03:00.187 --> 01:03:02.314
Just... let's talk over here.

01:03:06.736 --> 01:03:10.531
What do you want?
I told you everything I know.

01:03:10.573 --> 01:03:13.576
What did you tell us?
That you don't recall anything?

01:03:13.617 --> 01:03:14.535
No, let's go downtown.

01:03:14.577 --> 01:03:16.996
You can try to recall
more at the station.

01:03:24.503 --> 01:03:25.588
<i>Anything?</i>

01:03:25.713 --> 01:03:28.299
The man who asked Yoon to
give Lee Sang-mok a false ID

01:03:28.841 --> 01:03:30.801
was NIS Deputy Park In-kyu.

01:03:30.968 --> 01:03:33.888
<i>If the NIS is involved,
this is no ordinary case.</i>

01:03:41.937 --> 01:03:44.190
This is Commissioner Moon Jong-hyuk,

01:03:44.899 --> 01:03:46.567
Choi Tae-suk of NIS,

01:03:46.859 --> 01:03:48.652
and Chief Han of Foreign Investigations.

01:03:49.862 --> 01:03:51.280
This way please.

01:03:55.743 --> 01:03:59.789
What are your thoughts on Min?

01:04:00.456 --> 01:04:04.710
He didn't seem to be a violent man,

01:04:04.752 --> 01:04:07.254
more a clever businessman.

01:04:07.505 --> 01:04:14.679
It all began after setting up
a small company together.

01:04:14.970 --> 01:04:18.974
I hear you're funding this operation.

01:04:19.016 --> 01:04:21.519
Is there a special reason?

01:04:26.941 --> 01:04:29.193
This feels like an interrogation.

01:04:30.611 --> 01:04:32.613
I'm sorry you feel that way,

01:04:32.655 --> 01:04:35.866
but I need to know certain
things before I brief you.

01:04:37.535 --> 01:04:38.535
Call coming in.

01:04:39.286 --> 01:04:42.123
Don't be alarmed if I cut in.

01:04:42.164 --> 01:04:43.958
Talk to him like usual.

01:04:44.375 --> 01:04:45.459
Okay.

01:04:50.089 --> 01:04:51.382
<i>Hello, Mr. Chairman!</i>

01:04:51.674 --> 01:04:54.927
Hello, Tae-gu. Was this the only way?

01:04:55.177 --> 01:04:57.346
You couldn't find some other means?

01:04:57.888 --> 01:04:59.432
<i>I am very sorry.</i>

01:04:59.557 --> 01:05:01.058
What is it that you want?

01:05:03.102 --> 01:05:04.937
If you'd rather not say in front...

01:05:04.979 --> 01:05:06.772
<i>No, it's okay.</i>

01:05:07.481 --> 01:05:09.775
<i>The Shangri-La Swiss
account is blocked.</i>

01:05:09.817 --> 01:05:11.652
I will fix that right away.

01:05:12.570 --> 01:05:16.532
It's probably because my name has
been removed from the account.

01:05:16.574 --> 01:05:17.825
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

01:05:18.951 --> 01:05:21.620
Anything else?

01:05:22.997 --> 01:05:24.874
Anything else...

01:05:31.422 --> 01:05:34.425
Oh... why did you kill Hyun-ju?

01:05:39.472 --> 01:05:40.181
Who?

01:05:40.389 --> 01:05:42.516
<i>Hyun-ju, from Yangjae.</i>

01:05:43.934 --> 01:05:47.396
<i>10 days ago. It was on the news.</i>

01:05:47.563 --> 01:05:49.190
What're you talking about?

01:05:49.982 --> 01:05:50.982
Who?

01:05:52.485 --> 01:05:53.485
Really?

01:05:54.278 --> 01:05:56.989
You don't know her?

01:05:57.448 --> 01:06:00.284
You want me to resolve
the Swiss account issue?

01:06:01.077 --> 01:06:04.580
Yes, of course,

01:06:05.414 --> 01:06:09.710
but you saying you don't know
Hyun-ju really bothers me.

01:06:14.632 --> 01:06:15.632
Tae-gu...

01:06:16.050 --> 01:06:17.259
Yes, sir?

01:06:18.052 --> 01:06:23.641
I don't know what you're up to,
but you could get hurt.

01:06:24.183 --> 01:06:30.481
I ask if you know someone, and
you fucking say I could get hurt.

01:06:33.150 --> 01:06:34.402
Chae-youn?

01:06:34.902 --> 01:06:35.902
Yes.

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:41.409
Do you know Yoo Hyun-ju?
A hostage case. 10 days ago.

01:06:41.826 --> 01:06:44.161
<i>You were at the scene.</i>

01:06:53.838 --> 01:06:55.756
<i>Are you okay?</i>

01:06:59.719 --> 01:07:02.096
Well, do you know her or not?

01:07:05.057 --> 01:07:06.142
I do.

01:07:06.267 --> 01:07:08.477
Right? You remember?

01:07:09.228 --> 01:07:12.857
<i>How did that end?
It was a robbery, right?</i>

01:07:13.649 --> 01:07:14.649
<i>Yes.</i>

01:07:15.192 --> 01:07:16.360
Did you believe that?

01:07:18.237 --> 01:07:19.739
<i>You saw the paintings?</i>

01:07:24.201 --> 01:07:24.869
I did.

01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:26.829
<i>Did you find the owner?</i>

01:07:29.123 --> 01:07:31.125
They were killed at the scene.

01:07:31.417 --> 01:07:35.629
Killed? No, no.

01:07:35.671 --> 01:07:37.757
<i>The owner is alive and well.</i>

01:07:40.343 --> 01:07:42.470
<i>Right there next to you.</i>

01:07:43.262 --> 01:07:46.474
<i>Actually, to be exact,</i>

01:07:46.515 --> 01:07:49.727
one of the owners. Isn't that so?

01:07:50.269 --> 01:07:54.315
What do you think you'll
gain with these lies?

01:07:55.483 --> 01:08:00.112
All you have to do is open
the Swiss account,

01:08:00.154 --> 01:08:05.201
but if you could also tell me why
you killed her, that'd be great.

01:08:06.035 --> 01:08:10.456
I don't know who you
are talking about.

01:08:12.917 --> 01:08:14.168
Chae-youn?

01:08:16.212 --> 01:08:18.798
<i>Do I seem to be lying?</i>

01:08:20.883 --> 01:08:21.883
No.

01:08:23.344 --> 01:08:28.683
Right, yet he calls me a liar.

01:08:29.058 --> 01:08:30.100
<i>That's hurtful.</i>

01:08:30.184 --> 01:08:34.979
What makes you think he killed her?

01:08:35.939 --> 01:08:37.692
<i>Where do I begin?</i>

01:08:39.318 --> 01:08:44.782
<i>See, she was his keeper of secrets.</i>

01:08:45.198 --> 01:08:48.118
<i>Looks like he can't recall.</i>

01:08:48.828 --> 01:08:51.122
I introduced the two of them.

01:08:52.456 --> 01:08:54.709
Hello, my name is Yoo Hyun-ju.

01:08:54.917 --> 01:08:56.210
Good to meet you.

01:08:57.002 --> 01:08:59.505
<i>There isn't that much cash in there.</i>

01:08:59.546 --> 01:09:03.175
<i>About 2 billion won. For emergencies.</i>

01:09:03.718 --> 01:09:07.138
<i>The real money is in the paintings.</i>

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:10.057
<i>Each one is worth 10 billion or better.</i>

01:09:12.935 --> 01:09:14.895
Perfect for laundering money.

01:09:15.563 --> 01:09:19.024
<i>But where did all of it go?</i>

01:09:19.483 --> 01:09:21.318
Oh, come on,

01:09:22.194 --> 01:09:24.154
you still don't believe me?

01:09:26.407 --> 01:09:27.450
<i>Sir.</i>

01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:29.785
<i>what does a fighter jet's
specifications matter?</i>

01:09:29.993 --> 01:09:35.124
<i>Pilots retire before they
can learn all functions.</i>

01:09:35.249 --> 01:09:39.127
The media is all over that.

01:09:39.795 --> 01:09:43.758
New generation models will
be launched in just a year.

01:09:44.091 --> 01:09:46.719
So why are you dumping back stock now?

01:09:47.345 --> 01:09:52.015
The public won't know the difference.

01:09:52.515 --> 01:09:55.561
You just have to create good hype.

01:09:55.853 --> 01:09:58.064
Deputy Park, it's not that easy.

01:09:58.105 --> 01:10:02.151
Jung-tae, you have something to say?

01:10:02.318 --> 01:10:05.029
No, sir. Why would you say that?

01:10:05.154 --> 01:10:07.531
Do you think I'm doing
all this just for myself?

01:10:07.615 --> 01:10:09.867
No, sir, that's not it.

01:10:09.909 --> 01:10:10.785
Hey...

01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:14.413
<i>you won't take the fall
even if this all goes wrong.</i>

01:10:14.789 --> 01:10:17.041
<i>We are in the same boat.</i>

01:10:22.004 --> 01:10:26.884
<i>The chairman, he trusts no one,</i>

01:10:27.593 --> 01:10:31.847
<i>so he has a habit of recording
important conversations.</i>

01:10:31.889 --> 01:10:34.433
<i>He's probably doing it right now.</i>

01:10:36.519 --> 01:10:38.979
Are you following me?

01:10:40.606 --> 01:10:45.194
Do you think you can arrest them all?

01:10:46.404 --> 01:10:50.157
Recordings are difficult
to use as evidence,

01:10:50.199 --> 01:10:51.909
particularly in these cases.

01:10:52.868 --> 01:10:54.995
You need something better?

01:10:57.123 --> 01:11:01.293
Okay, let's take it to
the next level then.

01:11:02.253 --> 01:11:04.755
National Security Chief Hwang Ju-ik.

01:11:05.172 --> 01:11:06.465
<i>Exactly one hour.</i>

01:11:06.507 --> 01:11:11.178
<i>If he's not here, they all die,</i>

01:11:11.429 --> 01:11:13.264
<i>including Cho-rong.</i>

01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:45.755
Everyone out.

01:11:55.181 --> 01:12:01.729
Until Min is removed and
all the evidence is gone,

01:12:02.063 --> 01:12:05.524
nobody leaves this room.

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.235
Is that clear?

01:12:09.737 --> 01:12:11.405
Goddammit...

01:12:32.009 --> 01:12:33.594
She lost her parents while in college,

01:12:33.636 --> 01:12:37.682
studied accounting, then
worked for a year at a bank.

01:12:37.765 --> 01:12:38.950
After that, no real job to speak of.

01:12:38.974 --> 01:12:41.727
Hyun-ju's account records
show large transactions,

01:12:42.019 --> 01:12:44.230
but there's nothing on Min Tae-gu.

01:12:44.855 --> 01:12:46.166
There's gotta be
something between them.

01:12:46.190 --> 01:12:47.233
Dig deeper.

01:12:47.274 --> 01:12:48.274
Okay.

01:12:48.567 --> 01:12:50.611
Maybe they were lovers?

01:12:54.907 --> 01:12:55.907
Inspector Ha?

01:12:56.450 --> 01:12:57.576
What is it?

01:12:57.868 --> 01:13:01.956
Hwang is with the President.

01:13:02.498 --> 01:13:06.127
He said we should do everything
to ensure the safety of the hostages.

01:13:06.168 --> 01:13:08.129
How can we?!

01:13:08.504 --> 01:13:09.547
Did you not hear him?

01:13:09.839 --> 01:13:12.216
If Hwang doesn't come, they all die.

01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:14.844
Do your best.

01:13:19.473 --> 01:13:20.766
Shit...

01:13:29.942 --> 01:13:30.609
Yeah.

01:13:30.651 --> 01:13:33.029
I tracked NIS Deputy Park's phone.

01:13:33.612 --> 01:13:36.157
Nothing. They're all borrowed names,

01:13:36.574 --> 01:13:37.574
<i>but on second look,</i>

01:13:38.784 --> 01:13:41.203
I saw Captain Jung's number.

01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:42.163
What?

01:13:42.246 --> 01:13:45.624
Park and Jung talked a few
times after the Yangjae case.

01:13:45.958 --> 01:13:47.293
What do you mean?

01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:53.090
Looks like Jung took a bribe.

01:13:53.591 --> 01:13:57.219
<i>He paid off all his debts
and his wife's medical bills.</i>

01:13:57.428 --> 01:14:00.056
How can that be? Are you sure?

01:14:00.598 --> 01:14:02.558
I checked.

01:14:03.976 --> 01:14:07.271
<i>Look, I have to go. I'll call you later.</i>

01:14:09.357 --> 01:14:11.942
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

01:14:15.446 --> 01:14:18.866
<i>Take a few days off.
Let's talk after my trip.</i>

01:14:22.328 --> 01:14:25.748
- What the...
- The commissioner wants to see you.

01:14:29.168 --> 01:14:33.631
Buy more time. Two hours.

01:14:33.756 --> 01:14:37.635
Sir, there's no telling
what he'll do next.

01:14:38.135 --> 01:14:40.638
He's shown his face, which means
this may be a suicide mission.

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:41.680
This order

01:14:42.932 --> 01:14:44.934
came from all the way up.

01:14:47.269 --> 01:14:48.562
Do you understand?

01:14:56.487 --> 01:15:00.741
<i>Malacca Straits, T-2 hours</i>

01:15:03.119 --> 01:15:04.120
<i>All clear.</i>

01:15:04.412 --> 01:15:05.413
<i>Forward.</i>

01:15:13.462 --> 01:15:15.381
Shadow is on radio.

01:15:22.722 --> 01:15:23.973
You're alone.

01:15:26.267 --> 01:15:30.146
<i>We can't reach Hwang.</i>

01:15:30.980 --> 01:15:33.482
<i>NIS is looking.</i>

01:15:33.774 --> 01:15:34.774
And Koo?

01:15:35.234 --> 01:15:36.610
<i>He is being</i>

01:15:37.153 --> 01:15:38.988
<i>interrogated.</i>

01:15:45.244 --> 01:15:46.620
Chief Hwang...

01:15:47.538 --> 01:15:49.165
he won't come.

01:15:49.248 --> 01:15:54.295
A promise is a promise.

01:15:54.670 --> 01:15:58.966
<i>Mr. Min, the people you're fighting,</i>

01:15:59.508 --> 01:16:01.510
<i>they can't be beaten like this.</i>

01:16:01.927 --> 01:16:05.348
<i>Let the hostages go and work with me.</i>

01:16:05.848 --> 01:16:07.183
I can help you.

01:16:08.017 --> 01:16:11.812
Chae-youn, you're coming on strong.

01:16:12.104 --> 01:16:16.650
<i>The co-owners of the paintings
Koo kept in Yoo Hyun-ju's care,</i>

01:16:16.942 --> 01:16:18.903
<i>the people who took them as bribes,</i>

01:16:19.362 --> 01:16:20.863
<i>I need their names.</i>

01:16:21.238 --> 01:16:24.075
If I tell you, you'll lose your job.

01:16:24.742 --> 01:16:26.452
Are you worrying about me?

01:16:29.372 --> 01:16:30.790
Let's say I did tell you...

01:16:30.831 --> 01:16:35.461
<i>If Koo is the owner, then he must
have visited Yoo at least once.</i>

01:16:35.795 --> 01:16:38.047
<i>There may be CCTV
footage or witnesses.</i>

01:16:38.089 --> 01:16:41.342
Then everything Koo said
about not knowing her is a lie.

01:16:41.550 --> 01:16:44.303
Hyun-ju's case will be reopened.

01:16:44.845 --> 01:16:49.141
Anyone linked to the case –
the victims, the robbers...

01:16:49.225 --> 01:16:50.685
I'll analyze them all over again.

01:16:50.726 --> 01:16:53.646
To find proof that Koo ordered it?

01:16:53.771 --> 01:16:57.358
If I have the list of the owners of
paintings and those who took the bribe...

01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.652
You can link them all.

01:17:01.821 --> 01:17:04.323
<i>Is the commissioner still there?</i>

01:17:06.826 --> 01:17:07.451
Yes.

01:17:07.702 --> 01:17:08.786
Bring him in.

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:17.795
<i>You heard everything she said?</i>

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:19.547
Yes, I did.

01:17:19.672 --> 01:17:23.759
Is Koo really being questioned?

01:17:25.011 --> 01:17:26.095
Yes, he is.

01:17:26.512 --> 01:17:32.435
If I give you the names of everyone,
will you reopen Yoo Hyun-ju's case?

01:17:33.185 --> 01:17:38.357
<i>It will be reopened, whether
or not you make the demand.</i>

01:17:40.568 --> 01:17:44.447
Is that an official statement?

01:17:44.572 --> 01:17:46.365
Yes, it is.

01:17:47.033 --> 01:17:48.033
What?

01:17:49.410 --> 01:17:51.037
Search 'police hostage'.

01:17:51.787 --> 01:17:52.787
Hold on.

01:18:02.631 --> 01:18:05.801
Min's being streamed live.

01:18:05.968 --> 01:18:06.594
What?!

01:18:06.635 --> 01:18:08.262
How? Where's it coming from?

01:18:08.929 --> 01:18:10.723
A Thai server.

01:18:11.057 --> 01:18:12.057
Show me.

01:18:15.436 --> 01:18:17.188
<i>We're the law-enforcement authority.</i>

01:18:18.189 --> 01:18:20.358
<i>How can the police make up a lie?</i>

01:18:20.941 --> 01:18:23.402
Inspector, this whole
thing's being streamed!

01:18:23.569 --> 01:18:27.198
Trust us and tell us what you want.

01:18:37.625 --> 01:18:39.794
It's on the news. Local cable TV.

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:41.045
Check the feed.

01:18:42.713 --> 01:18:44.131
<i>This just in.</i>

01:18:44.215 --> 01:18:47.551
<i>The hostage situation that
began a week ago in Bangkok,</i>

01:18:47.593 --> 01:18:49.905
<i>in which Daehan Daily's reporter
Lee Sang-mok was kidnapped,</i>

01:18:49.929 --> 01:18:52.056
<i>is being live streamed.</i>

01:18:52.098 --> 01:18:53.099
Shut it down!

01:18:53.432 --> 01:18:54.350
<i>Seoul Police's Captain...</i>

01:18:54.392 --> 01:18:57.728
Fuck! Hurry!

01:18:58.229 --> 01:19:01.023
Call the TV stations and stop
it from spreading!

01:19:01.732 --> 01:19:03.693
Check that news station first.

01:19:07.655 --> 01:19:08.698
Fuck...

01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:14.412
<i>So, the man in the live video is</i>

01:19:14.453 --> 01:19:16.539
<i>definitely commissioner Moon?</i>

01:19:16.997 --> 01:19:18.124
<i>Yes. Definitely.</i>

01:19:18.249 --> 01:19:21.711
<i>I am outside the police agency now.</i>

01:19:21.752 --> 01:19:24.588
<i>Access is being strictly controlled.</i>

01:19:24.630 --> 01:19:28.009
<i>Do we know who the victim was?</i>

01:19:28.050 --> 01:19:35.099
<i>Yes, the man killed by the kidnapper is
thought to be Captain Jung Jun-gu,</i>

01:19:35.224 --> 01:19:37.059
<i>though that still has not been confirmed.</i>

01:19:37.518 --> 01:19:38.310
What is it?

01:19:38.519 --> 01:19:40.271
It's being live streamed.

01:19:40.771 --> 01:19:41.981
Live?

01:19:42.106 --> 01:19:44.150
From a Thai server.

01:19:44.692 --> 01:19:45.860
It's Min's doing.

01:19:46.819 --> 01:19:50.072
That son of a bitch...

01:19:51.198 --> 01:19:52.198
Mr. Min,

01:19:52.992 --> 01:19:56.078
the live streaming, are you doing it?

01:19:57.788 --> 01:20:01.042
Oh, did I forget to tell you that?

01:20:01.417 --> 01:20:02.752
I'm sorry.

01:20:05.171 --> 01:20:07.506
Chae-youn, the number of hits...

01:20:08.716 --> 01:20:10.760
A million? Two?

01:20:12.428 --> 01:20:15.056
I know it's over 2.

01:20:15.139 --> 01:20:17.266
<i>But we'll see 10 million soon.</i>

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:23.356
If you keep tricking me, I can
neither help nor trust you.

01:20:24.523 --> 01:20:27.026
And I can trust you?

01:20:29.362 --> 01:20:31.697
Is Koo really being questioned?

01:20:33.032 --> 01:20:36.118
And Hwang, he really can't be reached?
Really?

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:54.136
<i>Mr. Hwang...</i>

01:20:54.428 --> 01:20:55.638
<i>are you watching?</i>

01:20:55.971 --> 01:20:56.972
One hour.

01:20:57.306 --> 01:20:59.058
<i>One last chance.</i>

01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:01.185
<i>If you're not here by then,</i>

01:21:02.311 --> 01:21:05.314
someone dies every 10 minutes,
starting with this bastard.

01:21:13.155 --> 01:21:14.198
Park?

01:21:14.782 --> 01:21:15.782
Yes, sir.

01:21:15.825 --> 01:21:19.537
Make up a story, with
Koo as the main player.

01:21:20.371 --> 01:21:21.371
Yes, sir.

01:21:21.706 --> 01:21:24.875
And begin the military op now.

01:21:25.876 --> 01:21:29.463
It's still light out. The hostages
could be put in danger.

01:21:29.505 --> 01:21:31.090
Begin now!

01:21:31.716 --> 01:21:35.094
Kill them all, including the hostages!

01:21:36.303 --> 01:21:37.596
The bastard!

01:21:37.722 --> 01:21:38.723
Sir!

01:21:39.181 --> 01:21:41.600
You didn't take care of the girl,

01:21:41.684 --> 01:21:43.686
and now we have this mess!

01:21:44.353 --> 01:21:46.897
You incompetent piece of shit!

01:22:04.248 --> 01:22:06.625
There must be something.

01:22:38.824 --> 01:22:40.576
What do you think will happen?

01:22:40.951 --> 01:22:45.206
I think they'll give up on you.

01:22:46.624 --> 01:22:48.751
Then you die too.

01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:55.257
This is the generator and
satellite broadcasting gear.

01:22:55.508 --> 01:22:57.968
That generator probably
powers the whole camp.

01:22:58.135 --> 01:23:02.431
If we take that out, we
can stop the broadcasts.

01:23:02.765 --> 01:23:05.226
Okay, start there.

01:23:05.559 --> 01:23:06.894
What about the hostages?

01:23:07.395 --> 01:23:09.230
We won't be able to see them.

01:23:09.355 --> 01:23:10.481
Inspector Ha!

01:23:11.273 --> 01:23:14.944
Can't you see how urgent this is?
It's a national crisis!

01:23:15.569 --> 01:23:19.615
Once we set up a KAISHOT
cam, we can see inside.

01:23:20.533 --> 01:23:22.660
Can you connect me to the agents?

01:23:22.702 --> 01:23:25.287
Hey, why are police involved
in a military operation?

01:23:25.454 --> 01:23:29.375
If the hostages die, will
you take responsibility?

01:23:30.334 --> 01:23:32.670
There's a 6 and 8 year old in there.

01:23:33.421 --> 01:23:36.090
If they die, will you take the blame?

01:23:38.175 --> 01:23:39.218
That's it.

01:23:45.808 --> 01:23:47.768
What're you doing?

01:23:47.893 --> 01:23:51.689
If you send me out, I'll go to Hwang,

01:23:51.981 --> 01:23:55.484
and if that doesn't work,
I'll tell Min about the op.

01:23:55.735 --> 01:23:56.736
Have you lost it?

01:23:56.777 --> 01:24:01.032
No, I'm completely sane.
It's you who's lost it.

01:24:12.376 --> 01:24:15.296
Where did you get the photograph?

01:24:15.504 --> 01:24:17.423
That's the old building.

01:24:17.465 --> 01:24:18.382
So this one is...?

01:24:18.424 --> 01:24:20.343
The new one.

01:24:21.093 --> 01:24:26.140
But there wasn't a Yoo Hyun-ju
at our orphanage back in 1993.

01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:31.562
There was a Hyun-ju though.
Want to see her?

01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:38.235
Her surname was Min.

01:24:38.361 --> 01:24:39.904
Min Hyun-ju.

01:24:41.614 --> 01:24:43.824
She had a brother.

01:24:54.085 --> 01:24:57.463
<i>Mr. Nag</i>

01:24:57.713 --> 01:25:00.049
<i>Hwang isn't coming, is he?</i>

01:25:03.928 --> 01:25:07.223
<i>If you pull the trigger, it's all over.</i>

01:25:08.265 --> 01:25:09.975
The hostages need to be alive.

01:25:10.351 --> 01:25:14.146
<i>That's how you keep the upper hand.</i>

01:25:14.313 --> 01:25:18.526
<i>Koo, Hwang, Park, and Yoo Hyun-ju.</i>

01:25:19.235 --> 01:25:21.195
<i>Their connection can be proven.</i>

01:25:21.696 --> 01:25:25.991
I know Jung is connected too.

01:25:26.575 --> 01:25:30.538
You want the truth to come out.

01:25:31.163 --> 01:25:32.581
<i>You can win this.</i>

01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:40.100
<i>Yoo Hyun-ju: real name Min Hyun-ju
Min Hyun-ju, Min Tae-gu, siblings</i>

01:25:48.889 --> 01:25:51.767
<i>Min's hideout, Thailand,
20 min to H-hour</i>

01:25:58.357 --> 01:25:59.775
KAISHOT on the main screen.

01:26:17.293 --> 01:26:19.420
<i>Suppression team at cuckoo's nest.</i>

01:26:19.628 --> 01:26:20.629
<i>Execute.</i>

01:26:36.187 --> 01:26:38.356
<i>Demolition team at generator.</i>

01:26:44.945 --> 01:26:46.447
<i>Suppression team, move in!</i>

01:26:51.327 --> 01:26:53.829
<i>Suppression team moving in.
Need more time.</i>

01:26:58.376 --> 01:26:59.377
<i>Mr. Min.</i>

01:27:02.672 --> 01:27:05.132
I promise you,

01:27:05.216 --> 01:27:06.258
if you let them go,

01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:09.345
I will do all I can to bring Koo
and his accomplices to justice.

01:27:09.387 --> 01:27:14.850
If I let them go, Hyun-ju's case will be
buried, and they'll get off scot-free.

01:27:15.351 --> 01:27:16.351
Plus, they'll kill me.

01:27:18.270 --> 01:27:22.983
Korea's not so innocent
and beautiful anymore.

01:27:23.025 --> 01:27:25.194
Times have changed.

01:27:26.278 --> 01:27:29.907
We will protect you as a witness.

01:27:30.282 --> 01:27:33.202
Oh, you will protect me?

01:27:34.036 --> 01:27:38.040
I am so grateful. Drinks are on me.

01:27:47.174 --> 01:27:48.884
<i>Inspector Ha,</i>

01:27:48.968 --> 01:27:50.594
you suck as a negotiator.

01:27:51.095 --> 01:27:56.642
You're too passionate
and a terrible liar.

01:28:03.357 --> 01:28:10.823
Please, let them go. I will defend you.

01:28:11.824 --> 01:28:14.201
Just like her...

01:28:21.751 --> 01:28:22.877
Ready to move in.

01:28:23.669 --> 01:28:25.463
<i>Demolition team ready.</i>

01:28:34.972 --> 01:28:35.972
Fire in the hole.

01:28:43.689 --> 01:28:44.982
<i>Suppression team, go.</i>

01:28:45.399 --> 01:28:46.067
Blowing doors.

01:28:46.233 --> 01:28:47.526
Stop!

01:28:47.693 --> 01:28:49.129
- There's a bomb inside!
<i>- Three, two, one...</i>

01:28:49.153 --> 01:28:50.738
Halt. Explosives inside.

01:28:50.905 --> 01:28:51.905
Halt!

01:28:52.406 --> 01:28:53.741
Holding position.

01:28:54.533 --> 01:28:55.743
The hostages are

01:28:55.785 --> 01:28:57.453
rigged with explosives.

01:28:57.495 --> 01:29:00.122
Who cares? Just move in!

01:29:00.581 --> 01:29:01.832
We need to stop.

01:29:01.999 --> 01:29:03.834
Hurry up and move in!

01:29:06.295 --> 01:29:07.295
<i>Move in.</i>

01:29:10.508 --> 01:29:11.508
Move in.

01:29:12.176 --> 01:29:13.636
We need to stop!

01:29:13.761 --> 01:29:15.096
There are children!

01:29:15.179 --> 01:29:16.514
Stop!

01:30:00.433 --> 01:30:01.559
Okay...

01:30:03.686 --> 01:30:08.232
Min seems to have blown himself
up, along with the hostages.

01:30:15.614 --> 01:30:16.866
Get me a drink.

01:30:50.066 --> 01:30:51.817
Mr. Choi, good work.

01:30:51.942 --> 01:30:53.569
Good work, good work.

01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:55.571
Good work.

01:30:56.113 --> 01:30:57.615
Chief Han, nice work.

01:30:57.823 --> 01:30:58.823
Inspector Ha.

01:30:58.866 --> 01:31:00.117
Min is alive.

01:31:03.287 --> 01:31:07.708
The sunlight disappears
at 5:08 local time.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.002
That's before sundown.

01:31:10.169 --> 01:31:11.169
What?

01:31:11.837 --> 01:31:14.924
Korea is 2 hours ahead of
Thailand, so the time is 7:08.

01:31:14.965 --> 01:31:17.051
Today's sundown was at 7:01.

01:31:19.261 --> 01:31:20.846
Min's in Korea.

01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:45.746
Find everyone who traveled from
Bangkok to Seoul the last 3 days.

01:31:45.913 --> 01:31:48.916
Look at cargo too. Get me everything.

01:31:49.875 --> 01:31:53.254
CCTV, immigration, cargo, everything.

01:32:25.536 --> 01:32:27.830
Everyone, good work.

01:32:28.456 --> 01:32:30.958
Park and Son, wrap things up.

01:32:31.292 --> 01:32:32.001
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

01:32:32.209 --> 01:32:33.502
I'm sorry.

01:32:34.503 --> 01:32:38.632
What a total mess.

01:32:39.216 --> 01:32:39.967
Really.

01:32:40.217 --> 01:32:41.969
Drink up.

01:32:45.723 --> 01:32:46.599
Pick up.

01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:48.476
Pick up, pick up, please.

01:32:51.312 --> 01:32:52.772
Secretary Gong

01:32:56.484 --> 01:32:57.484
Fuck!

01:33:07.995 --> 01:33:08.995
Freeze!

01:33:21.842 --> 01:33:22.842
Check it out.

01:33:24.053 --> 01:33:25.053
Hey...

01:33:25.388 --> 01:33:26.388
Hey!

01:33:26.722 --> 01:33:27.848
Didn't you see the sign?

01:33:29.308 --> 01:33:30.434
Drop the guns!

01:33:31.352 --> 01:33:32.228
Drop the gun.

01:33:32.353 --> 01:33:33.353
Drop the gun!

01:33:34.271 --> 01:33:35.356
On the ground!

01:33:41.237 --> 01:33:42.613
I'll take it from here.

01:33:42.738 --> 01:33:43.322
Boss!

01:33:43.406 --> 01:33:44.406
Boss!

01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:54.166
You did well.

01:34:06.262 --> 01:34:07.262
Got it!

01:34:09.473 --> 01:34:11.660
He came by cargo flight, two
days ago, Cheongju Airport.

01:34:11.684 --> 01:34:13.811
Under the name Ko Min-jun,
a trading firm employee.

01:34:14.228 --> 01:34:15.228
Inspector!

01:34:15.479 --> 01:34:16.479
The Superintendent.

01:34:18.065 --> 01:34:18.691
Hello?

01:34:18.733 --> 01:34:21.694
You were right, Inspector Ha!
He's here in Korea.

01:34:21.861 --> 01:34:22.486
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:34:22.528 --> 01:34:23.612
Somang orphanage.

01:34:24.572 --> 01:34:25.823
<i>What about the hostages?</i>

01:34:26.073 --> 01:34:27.074
The hostages,

01:34:27.825 --> 01:34:30.286
they're fine. I called an ambulance.

01:34:30.619 --> 01:34:31.412
And Min Tae-gu?

01:34:31.454 --> 01:34:32.872
He took off an hour ago.

01:34:42.048 --> 01:34:43.883
Where is Hwang and Koo?

01:34:44.008 --> 01:34:45.885
I told you. At the presidential office.

01:34:45.926 --> 01:34:48.637
If you lie to me, they are in danger!

01:35:32.973 --> 01:35:34.975
Don't get up. Take a seat.

01:35:37.269 --> 01:35:38.437
Sit down.

01:35:46.654 --> 01:35:49.657
Tae-gu, you...

01:35:50.825 --> 01:35:52.076
Be quiet.

01:35:53.327 --> 01:35:54.370
And Mr. Chairman...

01:35:56.122 --> 01:35:59.166
one word out of you, and you're dead.

01:36:09.802 --> 01:36:10.802
So,

01:36:10.928 --> 01:36:11.971
want to come with us?

01:36:21.856 --> 01:36:24.066
This is the place, huh?

01:36:24.525 --> 01:36:26.193
Hyun-ju mentioned it.

01:36:27.445 --> 01:36:29.989
A place just plastered with money.

01:36:30.948 --> 01:36:33.576
Min... Tae-gu, is it?

01:36:33.909 --> 01:36:37.455
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

01:36:37.496 --> 01:36:40.166
Misunderstanding?

01:36:40.207 --> 01:36:41.792
Look here, Min...

01:36:48.090 --> 01:36:49.967
I said don't talk.

01:37:17.787 --> 01:37:20.373
<i>Target has moved from the
parking lot to the VIP lounge.</i>

01:37:20.623 --> 01:37:22.166
<i>Move quickly.</i>

01:37:37.765 --> 01:37:38.808
That's right.

01:37:40.726 --> 01:37:48.776
Sometimes you need a sacrifice.

01:37:49.443 --> 01:37:52.154
It's okay if that's trash like us.

01:37:53.322 --> 01:37:54.490
But...

01:37:56.659 --> 01:38:01.831
to do something like that
to someone like Hyun-ju.

01:38:03.958 --> 01:38:07.128
That's just fucking shitty.

01:38:09.171 --> 01:38:11.257
Min...

01:38:11.799 --> 01:38:13.175
what do you want?

01:38:13.384 --> 01:38:14.719
No, how...

01:38:15.177 --> 01:38:18.848
can we be forgiven?

01:38:19.015 --> 01:38:25.229
I don't know. Ask Hyun-ju.

01:38:28.107 --> 01:38:31.193
Let's go and ask her together.

01:38:33.863 --> 01:38:34.863
Mr. Min!

01:38:34.989 --> 01:38:35.989
Mr. Min...

01:38:46.375 --> 01:38:48.377
Go. If you don't want to die.

01:38:49.253 --> 01:38:53.132
I know why you called for me.

01:38:54.425 --> 01:38:55.760
Min Hyun-ju,

01:38:56.927 --> 01:38:58.721
your sister,

01:38:59.930 --> 01:39:01.891
I let her die.

01:39:03.642 --> 01:39:04.894
I am sorry.

01:39:06.062 --> 01:39:14.070
I know why you had to do this.
I see why this was the only way.

01:39:15.613 --> 01:39:19.325
But please stop now.

01:39:20.701 --> 01:39:23.079
The truth you want to bring to light,

01:39:25.247 --> 01:39:28.834
I will do it.

01:39:29.627 --> 01:39:30.795
Truth?

01:39:33.547 --> 01:39:35.758
Should I tell you the truth?

01:39:40.638 --> 01:39:43.057
It was me

01:39:47.019 --> 01:39:48.604
that got Hyun-ju killed.

01:39:48.979 --> 01:39:52.900
<i>It was me who told
her to steal the files.</i>

01:39:53.234 --> 01:39:55.277
<i>For my business.</i>

01:40:04.745 --> 01:40:07.373
<i>She was just doing what I told her.</i>

01:40:08.666 --> 01:40:11.877
<i>And she died for it.</i>

01:40:14.964 --> 01:40:18.926
That's the real truth.

01:40:21.762 --> 01:40:22.930
Get it?

01:40:27.685 --> 01:40:29.145
Awaiting orders.

01:40:29.353 --> 01:40:30.855
<i>Clear to take a shot.</i>

01:40:40.489 --> 01:40:42.491
Visual lost. Obstacle.

01:40:53.252 --> 01:40:55.546
I don't want to kill you.

01:40:55.671 --> 01:41:00.718
Is this all you wanted?
I can uncover the truth!

01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:03.095
Why won't you fuck off?!

01:41:08.768 --> 01:41:10.061
Just do it

01:41:11.562 --> 01:41:15.733
because I'm tired of watching people die.

01:41:16.692 --> 01:41:19.070
You are a pain in the ass.

01:41:22.823 --> 01:41:23.823
Tae-gu,

01:41:24.575 --> 01:41:28.788
trust me, for just a little bit.

01:41:30.206 --> 01:41:32.625
What do you want with
a shitty life like mine?

01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:36.921
Give me one more chance.

01:41:37.088 --> 01:41:38.255
Trust you again?

01:41:38.506 --> 01:41:39.632
Min Hyun-ju...

01:41:40.216 --> 01:41:41.842
think of her.

01:41:43.219 --> 01:41:47.056
Show the world how these
monsters killed your sister.

01:41:47.848 --> 01:41:50.518
Then die or... do whatever it is you want.

01:42:09.328 --> 01:42:11.580
I actually did want to
get a drink with you.

01:42:13.499 --> 01:42:14.625
No, Tae-gu.

01:42:15.084 --> 01:42:16.335
Don't.

01:42:41.861 --> 01:42:42.861
<i>Hyun-ju...</i>

01:42:48.159 --> 01:42:49.452
let's not do this.

01:42:49.744 --> 01:42:51.454
It's too dangerous.

01:42:53.748 --> 01:42:56.625
I'd rather do this than
live in fear my whole life.

01:42:56.751 --> 01:42:57.585
Hyun-ju, the situation over there...

01:42:57.626 --> 01:42:59.378
Find us a place to live.

01:42:59.795 --> 01:43:01.213
Somewhere with an ocean view.

01:43:02.548 --> 01:43:04.050
Don't worry.

01:43:05.176 --> 01:43:08.095
I got your back. Okay?

01:43:11.891 --> 01:43:13.809
You're a pain in the ass.

01:43:29.867 --> 01:43:30.868
Let's go.

01:43:31.369 --> 01:43:32.453
Get him outside!

01:43:39.752 --> 01:43:41.796
The detonator.

01:43:42.546 --> 01:43:43.546
It's off.

01:43:46.759 --> 01:43:50.221
Target eliminated. One hostage dead.

01:44:22.670 --> 01:44:23.337
Park.

01:44:23.587 --> 01:44:24.587
Sir?

01:44:24.839 --> 01:44:27.216
We need to change the story.

01:44:27.258 --> 01:44:30.052
Yes, it needs a lot of work.

01:44:30.678 --> 01:44:31.971
Think on it.

01:44:39.103 --> 01:44:44.066
Excuse me. I am Inspector Ha
from the Seoul Police Agency.

01:44:44.942 --> 01:44:48.320
Good work. Thanks to you
today's situation ended well.

01:44:48.487 --> 01:44:51.240
Take care of things here. Let's go.

01:44:52.116 --> 01:44:53.576
I'll tell you something now

01:44:53.617 --> 01:44:55.036
that my peers will repeat later.

01:44:55.244 --> 01:45:00.041
For the murder of Yoo Hyun-ju,
illegal arms dealing, bribery,

01:45:00.082 --> 01:45:01.917
and treason, you are under arrest.

01:45:02.084 --> 01:45:03.084
What?

01:45:05.254 --> 01:45:09.050
You have the right to remain silent.

01:45:09.300 --> 01:45:12.553
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

01:45:12.762 --> 01:45:14.847
You have the right to an attorney.

01:45:15.181 --> 01:45:19.518
If you cannot afford one, one will be
appointed to you by the court.

01:45:19.727 --> 01:45:21.979
Crazy bitch!

01:45:23.189 --> 01:45:24.440
Go, now!

01:45:26.442 --> 01:45:27.443
Go!

01:45:41.123 --> 01:45:42.249
Can you comment?

01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:44.085
What happened here?

01:46:03.813 --> 01:46:05.189
Give me a smoke.

01:46:06.941 --> 01:46:07.941
What?

01:46:14.907 --> 01:46:16.075
What is this?

01:46:16.367 --> 01:46:17.535
We need our health.

01:46:34.135 --> 01:46:35.136
What's that?

01:47:06.542 --> 01:47:08.085
Any words to the public?

01:47:08.294 --> 01:47:10.421
I will cooperate with the investigation.

01:47:10.463 --> 01:47:11.881
The charge of conspiracy to murder!

01:47:11.922 --> 01:47:14.258
And illegal arms
dealing, do you admit?

01:47:16.886 --> 01:47:17.887
Can you explain?

01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:24.268
Witness, come forward.

01:47:31.692 --> 01:47:33.110
Present the evidence.

01:47:55.466 --> 01:47:58.177
All rise, hold your right hands up.

01:48:00.137 --> 01:48:01.180
Take the oath.

01:48:06.227 --> 01:48:07.103
Oath...

01:48:07.144 --> 01:48:10.898
I, in the Parliament's probe
on military and government

01:48:10.940 --> 01:48:16.987
corruption in the case
of Yoo Hyun-ju's death,

01:48:17.071 --> 01:48:24.578
swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth.

01:48:25.079 --> 01:48:30.334
I will accept prosecution
if any falsehood is discovered.

01:48:31.085 --> 01:48:35.881
I am Inspector Ha Chae-youn
with the Seoul Metropolitan Police.
