00:42.920 --> 00:44.480
Best coffee in Oxford.

00:51.400 --> 00:53.360
No daemons.

00:53.360 --> 00:55.120
Seems barbaric, doesn't it?

00:55.120 --> 00:57.560
They have the appearance of freedom,

00:57.560 --> 01:00.680
but the government's far more
corrupt than the Magisterium.

01:00.680 --> 01:02.760
Twice as many shopping arcades,

01:02.760 --> 01:06.240
half as many places of worship.

01:06.240 --> 01:10.240
It's a culture of consumerism,
not faith.

01:10.240 --> 01:12.240
Prepare yourself, Marisa.

01:56.800 --> 01:58.120
Argh!

02:05.400 --> 02:08.720
OK, so his house
was set back from the street,

02:08.720 --> 02:11.640
and it had a driveway like this.

02:13.680 --> 02:16.360
Hm. What's that? The window.

02:16.360 --> 02:19.160
The window's really close
to Latrom's house -

02:19.160 --> 02:20.880
that can't be a coincidence.

02:20.880 --> 02:23.320
Then we shouldn't use it.
It's too risky.

02:24.360 --> 02:26.240
You'll have to cut a new window.

02:26.240 --> 02:28.960
If the worlds match up,
we can get even closer.

02:40.520 --> 02:44.120
I bought this shortly after I sold
my first Muscovite collection.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.680
Shall we?

02:47.960 --> 02:50.960
We know where the window is
in both worlds.

02:50.960 --> 02:53.520
So that'll help us find where to cut
through to Latrom's house.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.000
And then, when we're in,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.800
we should start by looking in the
room with all of the glass cabinets.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.480
The alethiometer must be there.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.840
That's assuming
I can definitely cut a window.

05:01.160 --> 05:03.120
Let me show you around.

05:23.400 --> 05:26.040
So this is your big secret?

05:26.040 --> 05:28.920
It must have taken you years
to build this collection.

05:28.920 --> 05:31.480
This item brings me
particular pleasure.

05:31.480 --> 05:35.800
I picked it up in Nova Zembla for
the price of a bread roll. Hm.

05:35.800 --> 05:39.000
Here, it's worth more than half
the vaults of Jordan College.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.800
Ah!

05:55.640 --> 05:58.680
This is a piece of wall

05:58.680 --> 06:01.080
that split the city of Berlin...

06:01.080 --> 06:03.880
Delightful as this...all is...

06:04.960 --> 06:06.920
..how does it connect to Lyra?

06:25.440 --> 06:27.960
Lyra will come here to do
the exchange.

06:33.400 --> 06:36.120
And as you can see, my home
is fully monitored.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.800
Real-time moving images.

06:38.800 --> 06:41.960
When she arrives,
we can trade what I want...

06:41.960 --> 06:43.760
..for what she wants.

06:48.120 --> 06:51.160
When I found her,
she was trying to read it.

06:51.160 --> 06:54.160
So you stole it from her?

06:54.160 --> 06:57.800
In the knowledge
that it would draw her to me...

06:59.280 --> 07:01.200
..for you.

07:02.200 --> 07:03.640
Hm.

07:05.240 --> 07:08.280
I'm not sure I can cut a window.
You can.

07:08.280 --> 07:10.680
It's like Giacomo said -
become the tip of the knife.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.320
Come on, you can do it.
I know you can.

07:34.680 --> 07:37.200
Is this your Oxford, Will?

07:37.200 --> 07:38.800
It is.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.320
Why are we whispering?

07:41.320 --> 07:43.400
I don't know.

07:43.400 --> 07:45.080
Come on, let's do another one.

07:47.080 --> 07:49.160
Will, you left the window open.

07:57.280 --> 07:59.720
Wait, I know this street.

07:59.720 --> 08:01.720
It's near the window in the park.

08:03.720 --> 08:06.120
He's getting good at this.

08:06.120 --> 08:07.640
He is.

08:07.640 --> 08:08.960
Come on.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.640
Lyra... Lyra, come and look at this.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.640
Look, Pan was right.

08:21.560 --> 08:23.200
The worlds do match up.

08:27.680 --> 08:29.920
So that means if we cut a window
by the tower...

08:29.920 --> 08:31.560
Then we cut into his house.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.280
The alethiometer's right there.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.800
And so is Latrom.

08:35.800 --> 08:37.200
We should wait until it's dark

08:37.200 --> 08:39.360
before trying anything
near the tower.

08:39.360 --> 08:41.680
Will, we can't let him have
the alethiometer.

08:41.680 --> 08:43.240
I know.

08:43.240 --> 08:44.880
We will get it back.

09:03.120 --> 09:07.240
The sound quality from these
speakers is quite something.

09:07.240 --> 09:09.640
I can see why you like it here.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.040
You'd like it here, too.

09:21.760 --> 09:24.920
I was considering
investing in a research project

09:24.920 --> 09:26.880
that would certainly suit you...

09:27.920 --> 09:29.920
..concerning elementary particles.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.240
What do they know of that
in this world?

09:35.240 --> 09:37.120
Enough to interest your daughter.

09:37.120 --> 09:38.640
Sorry?

09:40.680 --> 09:42.720
Carlo, can you make that stop?

09:45.520 --> 09:48.400
Explain what you mean.

09:48.400 --> 09:51.000
Lyra visited a woman called Malone.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.080
She runs a small department
in a college.

09:54.080 --> 09:56.360
What do you mean,
she runs a department?

09:58.280 --> 10:01.280
Academia works a little
differently here.

10:01.280 --> 10:04.360
She's investigating
the properties of dark matter.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.760
Dust.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.360
How far is the college from here?

10:11.360 --> 10:13.560
You can't be thinking of going.

10:13.560 --> 10:16.760
Carlo, Lyra hides things
from me instinctively,

10:16.760 --> 10:20.040
and as her mother, all I want to do
is to keep her safe,

10:20.040 --> 10:23.120
and the only way I can do that
is to know what she is doing.

10:23.120 --> 10:27.120
I need to know what strange ideas
her mind is being filled with.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.840
Fine.

10:28.840 --> 10:31.360
But you're far too conspicuous
like that.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.160
Hm.

10:52.760 --> 10:55.360
I didn't know
what your preference would be.

10:55.360 --> 10:56.800
Thank you, Carlo.

11:16.520 --> 11:18.160
Would you mind?

12:03.080 --> 12:05.560
It is fundamental
that the people retain

12:05.560 --> 12:07.960
the purity of their faith
in the Magisterium.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.640
I can assure you, Your Eminence,

12:09.640 --> 12:11.920
that though there are
some mutinous dissidents

12:11.920 --> 12:14.600
advocating Asriel's
preposterous notions,

12:14.600 --> 12:17.200
those men and - heaven help us...

12:18.920 --> 12:20.520
..women...

12:20.520 --> 12:24.200
..have been arrested and are under
the control of the Magisterium.

12:24.200 --> 12:27.600
All except Mrs Coulter,
a former ally to Asriel,

12:27.600 --> 12:31.480
who hasn't been seen since
your inauguration, Cardinal.

12:31.480 --> 12:35.440
Perhaps it is time
the Magisterium issued

12:35.440 --> 12:38.640
a firm public denial of the anomaly.

12:38.640 --> 12:40.920
No, Father Graves.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.560
We remind the people

12:42.560 --> 12:45.360
that it is their faith
in the Magisterium

12:45.360 --> 12:48.720
which will keep them safe
in these troubled times.

12:52.080 --> 12:54.280
I beg your pardon, Cardinal.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.120
Thank you.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.480
A telegram from the North
informing me

13:08.480 --> 13:12.520
that 24 of our Magisterium soldiers
at base camp

13:12.520 --> 13:17.520
have been killed in cold blood
by the witches.

13:17.520 --> 13:21.120
The bombing of their lands has led
them to retaliate.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.760
We restored order!

13:24.400 --> 13:27.480
Not before the witches travelled
through the anomaly.

13:27.480 --> 13:30.280
They've gone through?

13:30.280 --> 13:33.880
Your Eminence,
we're losing control of the North.

13:34.960 --> 13:37.840
We need more troops
around the anomaly immediately.

13:37.840 --> 13:41.680
The witches could return, bringing
corrupting influences to our world.

13:41.680 --> 13:44.440
Cardinal, a decision must be made.

13:44.440 --> 13:47.040
We need to show strength
in the face of insurrection.

13:47.040 --> 13:48.280
This tragedy...

13:50.120 --> 13:51.520
..is not a setback.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.800
It is a sign from the Authority.

13:56.800 --> 13:59.200
The Authority has sensed

13:59.200 --> 14:01.760
a lack of devotion among our ranks,

14:01.760 --> 14:04.320
and for this treachery,

14:04.320 --> 14:08.600
24 of our brothers have been taken
as martyrs.

14:12.440 --> 14:16.600
Father Graves, your faith
is clearly marred

14:16.600 --> 14:18.560
with the stain of doubt,

14:18.560 --> 14:21.840
and doubt is an insult
to the Authority

14:21.840 --> 14:25.080
which must be severely punished.

14:27.640 --> 14:29.280
Will you escort him to the cells?

14:31.880 --> 14:34.160
Yes, Cardinal. Your Eminence...

14:36.600 --> 14:38.920
Guards!

14:38.920 --> 14:41.160
This is absurd.

14:41.160 --> 14:43.400
My devotion to the Magisterium
is absolute.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.600
Cardinal...

14:48.760 --> 14:50.280
Cardinal!

14:53.120 --> 14:54.520
Thank you.

15:00.360 --> 15:01.880
Fra Pavel...

15:04.080 --> 15:07.800
Would you consult your alethiometer
and find out where she's gone?

15:10.080 --> 15:11.440
Who?

15:12.680 --> 15:14.120
Coulter!

15:14.120 --> 15:17.200
She said she was going in search
of something valuable.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.840
I want you to find out what it is.

15:19.840 --> 15:22.040
I am relying on you.

15:57.600 --> 15:59.080
Will I do?

15:59.080 --> 16:01.400
You look wonderful.

16:01.400 --> 16:02.480
Thank you.

16:03.600 --> 16:04.920
You're determined to go?

16:06.080 --> 16:08.280
If your daughter returns,
we may miss her.

16:08.280 --> 16:11.560
And that's why you must stay.

16:14.760 --> 16:16.840
Keys.

16:16.840 --> 16:18.600
Your daemon...

16:18.600 --> 16:19.800
..where is he?

16:23.560 --> 16:25.520
Surely I'm not the first woman
you've witnessed

16:25.520 --> 16:27.160
capable of self-control.

16:30.480 --> 16:33.720
Have you never encountered witches
on your travels?

16:43.520 --> 16:45.080
I won't be long.

17:37.200 --> 17:40.240
Can I help you? Yes. Mrs Malone?

17:40.240 --> 17:42.160
Doctor.

17:42.160 --> 17:44.440
This is my private office.
Who let you in here?

17:44.440 --> 17:46.240
Please forgive me.

17:46.240 --> 17:49.600
I have heard all about your work,
and it sounds...

17:50.560 --> 17:52.480
..absolutely fascinating.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.400
Whichever private investor sent you,

17:54.400 --> 17:56.360
you can read my work
when it's published.

17:56.360 --> 17:58.040
No-one sent me.

17:58.040 --> 17:59.600
Marisa Coulter.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.960
I'm an experimental theologian.

18:01.960 --> 18:05.960
I think you know my daughter...Lyra.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.720
You're Lyra's mother?

18:07.720 --> 18:09.080
I am.

18:10.440 --> 18:12.000
Is she all right?

18:12.000 --> 18:13.600
She's fine.

18:13.600 --> 18:16.560
We're staying with friends
in Oxford. I'm taking her home.

18:18.480 --> 18:21.160
She mentioned trouble at home.

18:21.160 --> 18:23.840
It's been a huge misunderstanding.

18:23.840 --> 18:26.360
She told me what happened,
and that is why I'm here.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.680
I wanted to apologise to you
in person,

18:30.680 --> 18:32.520
in case she was a nuisance.

18:32.520 --> 18:35.560
She wasn't a nuisance
in the slightest.

18:35.560 --> 18:38.240
I loved meeting Lyra.

18:38.240 --> 18:42.240
It was the most interesting
conversation I've had in ages.

18:42.240 --> 18:43.960
The ideas she has...

18:43.960 --> 18:45.920
What ideas are those?

18:45.920 --> 18:49.360
Well, about the morality
of dark matter,

18:49.360 --> 18:52.200
or, um, what did she call it?

18:52.200 --> 18:53.720
Dust.

18:53.720 --> 18:57.440
Her grasp on quantum physics
is astonishing.

18:57.440 --> 18:58.720
And the compass...

18:58.720 --> 19:00.880
The alethiometer. Yes.

19:00.880 --> 19:04.880
How she's able to understand it,
I have no idea.

19:04.880 --> 19:06.640
It's extraordinary.

19:08.320 --> 19:09.880
You must be so proud.

19:11.480 --> 19:12.960
I am.

19:15.480 --> 19:18.840
So it's experimental theology
you've been teaching her?

19:20.360 --> 19:22.520
It's not a field of research
I'm familiar with.

19:23.840 --> 19:27.200
Where would you say
theology comes to science?

19:28.400 --> 19:30.040
Where does it not?

19:37.800 --> 19:39.960
Sorry. Please sit.

19:39.960 --> 19:42.560
Tell me about your work.
I have a million questions.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.360
What was your doctorate in?

19:44.360 --> 19:47.600
Have you published any papers
I might recognise, or...?

19:49.840 --> 19:52.280
Sorry, I'll get you some coffee.
Hold on.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.120
Oh, dirty cups. Sorry about that.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.240
You must play the serpent.

20:39.720 --> 20:43.320
You have been preparing for this
as long as you have lived.

20:45.520 --> 20:49.320
You must make a journey
which starts at hornbeam.

20:50.760 --> 20:52.000
Hornbeam...

20:57.040 --> 20:58.560
Deceive the guardian...

21:00.680 --> 21:02.440
..find the entrance.

21:04.240 --> 21:05.720
Entrance to what?

21:05.720 --> 21:07.600
You will be protected.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.120
Protected from what?

21:11.560 --> 21:13.280
Save the girl...

21:15.400 --> 21:17.600
..and the boy.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.680
Your work here is finished.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.800
We will not speak again...

21:22.800 --> 21:25.200
...in this world.

22:00.080 --> 22:02.680
We start by cutting
into the cabinet room.

22:02.680 --> 22:04.640
What if Latrom's
in the cabinet room?

22:04.640 --> 22:07.400
You can't force him to give
the alethiometer back.

22:07.400 --> 22:09.360
I wasn't thinking about forcing him.

22:09.360 --> 22:11.560
You were. Oh, shut up, Pan.

22:11.560 --> 22:14.200
I was going to say Latrom's
probably got it hidden

22:14.200 --> 22:16.440
in a safe or something.

22:16.440 --> 22:19.480
I could distract him
to give you more time to search.

22:19.480 --> 22:22.720
You do the cutting,
I do the talking.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.120
What's that?

22:27.120 --> 22:30.160
Oh, Tullio, please, no!

22:30.160 --> 22:33.280
Don't leave! Why'd you leave me?!

22:33.280 --> 22:34.880
No, no, no, Tullio!

22:34.880 --> 22:37.880
The Spectres must have got him.

22:37.880 --> 22:39.880
Come on, come back! Come on!

22:39.880 --> 22:42.560
Oh, Tullio, no, no, no!

22:42.560 --> 22:44.600
No! I'm so sorry.

22:44.600 --> 22:47.080
You're sorry?! So you did this.

22:47.080 --> 22:49.800
Look, look, I've lost people, too.
I know what it feels like.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.200
Shut up!

22:51.200 --> 22:53.160
Did you take the knife?

22:53.160 --> 22:55.520
I never meant to hurt him.
It's not Will's fault.

22:55.520 --> 22:57.360
He attacked us.
He was going to kill us!

22:57.360 --> 23:00.640
But you admit it!
You did this to Tullio!

23:00.640 --> 23:01.680
No!

23:01.680 --> 23:04.240
Yes, you did. You did that
to Tullio. You did that!

23:04.240 --> 23:05.600
You see what you did?

23:05.600 --> 23:08.280
I'm so, so sorry. Please...

23:08.280 --> 23:10.200
You see what you did?

23:10.200 --> 23:11.360
I'm sorry.

23:11.360 --> 23:14.760
The knife was the only thing
keeping the Spectres away from him.

23:18.400 --> 23:20.120
They will get you.

23:30.560 --> 23:32.800
He should've been the knife bearer,
not me.

23:32.800 --> 23:34.640
The knife chose you.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.400
But why?

23:36.400 --> 23:39.520
Tullio stole the knife from Giacomo,
he tied him up.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.200
He would've killed us all.

23:43.520 --> 23:45.480
I never wanted to fight him.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.200
I know, Will.

23:48.200 --> 23:49.960
You had to, though.

23:49.960 --> 23:52.520
If we could have got it without
fighting, we would.

24:12.840 --> 24:16.720
"Now the serpent was more crafty
than any of the wild animals..."

24:18.640 --> 24:20.680
Crafty?

24:27.320 --> 24:29.640
Not in the lab? It's a miracle.

24:37.760 --> 24:40.400
That's not what you think.
I'm not judging.

24:41.720 --> 24:44.760
You aren't going back
to the convent, are you? No.

24:44.760 --> 24:46.840
OK, good. Um...

24:48.400 --> 24:52.320
You were right, though,
about my life.

24:52.320 --> 24:53.880
Something happened at work.

24:55.640 --> 24:59.400
It means taking time away
from my research, so...

24:59.400 --> 25:02.400
Finally! You really need a break.

25:02.400 --> 25:05.880
Taking some time is a great idea.

25:05.880 --> 25:09.040
We have friends with a cottage
in Devon.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.480
Um...

25:10.480 --> 25:13.160
I was considering somewhere

25:13.160 --> 25:15.080
a little bit further than Devon.

25:15.080 --> 25:16.520
Abroad?

25:16.520 --> 25:19.760
I might just see
where life takes me.

25:19.760 --> 25:21.440
I don't know yet.

25:48.480 --> 25:49.920
Lyra, you ready?

25:50.960 --> 25:52.400
It's time.

26:07.160 --> 26:09.280
I can't see anyone.

26:09.280 --> 26:12.480
Do you think Giacomo's still
in there?

26:12.480 --> 26:15.120
Do you think the Spectres got him?

26:15.120 --> 26:16.880
Don't think about that now.

26:18.640 --> 26:22.200
I don't want to hurt anyone else,
Lyra, whatever they've done.

26:23.720 --> 26:25.360
You don't have to.

26:25.360 --> 26:27.320
You just need to cut us in there,

26:27.320 --> 26:29.800
get the alethiometer and cut us out.

26:29.800 --> 26:31.560
Hm? OK.

27:20.680 --> 27:23.120
Yes. You were right!

27:23.120 --> 27:25.160
To get to the basement,
we'll have to go lower.

27:25.160 --> 27:26.400
Giacomo's rooms.

27:29.640 --> 27:30.680
Come on.

27:45.640 --> 27:47.960
What do they drink in this world?

27:47.960 --> 27:49.520
That they do rather well.

27:55.480 --> 27:57.680
How did you find Malone?
Impertinent.

28:01.600 --> 28:02.960
Intelligent.

28:05.120 --> 28:07.400
Free.

28:07.400 --> 28:11.000
I found her arrogant,
like many women in this world.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.760
Do you find me arrogant?

28:17.760 --> 28:19.160
Of course not.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.680
Take a breath, Marisa.

28:22.680 --> 28:23.840
You're clearly upset.

28:27.760 --> 28:29.720
Did you know,
when I was an honorary scholar,

28:29.720 --> 28:33.520
I achieved the highest results
in our final examination,

28:33.520 --> 28:35.720
but because I was a woman,

28:35.720 --> 28:38.760
I was denied a doctorate
by the Magisterium?

28:38.760 --> 28:40.840
I've written plenty of papers.

28:41.800 --> 28:44.160
But they're only published
if I agree to let a man...

28:45.600 --> 28:47.160
..take the credit.

28:51.040 --> 28:54.160
What did Malone say to upset you
so much?

28:54.160 --> 28:55.200
Hm.

28:59.400 --> 29:02.040
Do you know who I could have been
in this world?

29:07.800 --> 29:09.440
What do you remember...

29:10.720 --> 29:13.200
..about the scandal
over my affair with Asriel?

29:15.040 --> 29:17.000
He seduced you.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.200
And then abandoned you.

29:19.200 --> 29:20.960
Leaving me a grieving widow.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.080
With a child out of wedlock.

29:28.880 --> 29:30.920
Why are we talking about Asriel?

29:30.920 --> 29:34.200
We're not talking about Asriel,
we're talking about me!

29:44.280 --> 29:46.800
OK, I'll cut here. Wait, no.

29:46.800 --> 29:49.680
We're in the middle of the room.
What if Latrom's there?

29:49.680 --> 29:50.760
Yeah.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.560
Come here.

29:58.960 --> 30:00.840
We'll do it somewhere around here.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.160
Make it really small.

30:15.800 --> 30:17.840
He's in there.

30:17.840 --> 30:19.160
He has the alethiometer.

30:25.520 --> 30:27.800
I wish we could bash him on the head
and just take it.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.160
I've got a better idea.

30:30.240 --> 30:33.280
Why do you assume you're the first
person to have travelled here?

30:35.680 --> 30:37.040
Why not?

30:37.040 --> 30:39.480
If you found the window,
others could have.

30:39.480 --> 30:40.640
But if you were...

30:43.600 --> 30:45.400
..looking at what you've done...

30:47.880 --> 30:49.520
..you wouldn't deserve to be.

30:52.560 --> 30:55.280
That's a little unfair. Is it?

30:55.280 --> 30:59.520
This place is full of ideas,
ideas our world is hungry for,

30:59.520 --> 31:00.560
and yet you...

31:02.800 --> 31:06.600
..you have spent your time
trading trinkets.

31:06.600 --> 31:08.080
Give me some credit.

31:08.080 --> 31:10.880
You've only seen a fraction
of what I've achieved.

31:10.880 --> 31:13.440
I've built a company,
I've made a name for myself.

31:13.440 --> 31:17.720
Oh, and were you hoping to add me to
your little collection of treasures?

31:17.720 --> 31:22.880
I was hoping that this might be
a life you'd want to share.

31:24.960 --> 31:26.440
My dear Carlo.

31:29.040 --> 31:30.400
If you actually got me...

31:32.200 --> 31:34.800
..you wouldn't begin to know
what to do with me.

32:05.040 --> 32:06.360
She's here.

32:09.200 --> 32:10.640
Bring her down.

32:29.840 --> 32:31.320
OK.

32:34.120 --> 32:38.160
One, two, three, four...

32:39.640 --> 32:40.800
Lyra!

32:42.840 --> 32:45.560
Why don't you come inside?
Where's my alethiometer?

32:45.560 --> 32:47.000
Where's my knife?

32:47.000 --> 32:49.160
Will's got it. He's on his way.

33:01.640 --> 33:03.080
Always close the window.

33:51.920 --> 33:55.560
Why don't you come inside
and we can talk about this?

33:55.560 --> 33:58.160
Will will be here any minute now.

34:15.200 --> 34:17.240
Agh!

34:22.200 --> 34:23.880
Stay back. He's going to attack.

34:27.280 --> 34:28.800
Hello.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.960
So you must be Lyra's new friend.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.640
What?

34:34.800 --> 34:36.000
Thank you.

34:39.920 --> 34:42.040
Will! Lyra!

34:44.920 --> 34:46.360
Lyra.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.640
No... Lyra...

34:53.400 --> 34:54.920
The door's locked.

35:06.480 --> 35:07.640
You found it.

35:07.640 --> 35:10.080
Don't come any closer. Stay back.

35:11.200 --> 35:12.720
I thought we had a deal.

35:12.720 --> 35:14.600
Sit down.

35:14.600 --> 35:16.880
The deal's off.

35:16.880 --> 35:20.120
I mean it! I'll cut this.
Just give me the knife.

35:20.120 --> 35:21.520
Lyra!

35:21.520 --> 35:24.040
Here. This is yours.

35:26.600 --> 35:28.960
Take it.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.920
And why would I trust you?

35:32.360 --> 35:34.040
Stay back, I mean it.

35:34.040 --> 35:37.360
Don't you dare. That carving is
of huge historical importance.

35:39.400 --> 35:41.080
I heard you could read it.

35:41.080 --> 35:43.600
I'd love you to show me.

35:43.600 --> 35:47.040
And then I can tell you more
about Dust, if you want me to,

35:47.040 --> 35:50.760
and why Asriel did what he did
to your friend Roger.

35:50.760 --> 35:53.560
I don't want to hurt you.
I've seen what the knife can do.

35:55.960 --> 35:59.240
Lyra, you are special.

35:59.240 --> 36:03.680
I know you don't believe me,
but I am only trying to protect you.

36:03.680 --> 36:05.680
You can already read
the alethiometer.

36:05.680 --> 36:08.320
I can teach you to use that power
in other ways.

36:08.320 --> 36:10.320
Lyra! We need to get out of here.

36:10.320 --> 36:12.200
Give me the knife
and you can leave...

36:12.200 --> 36:14.360
Lyra, stay away from that boy.

36:14.360 --> 36:17.040
Do you understand me?
He will do you nothing but harm.

36:17.040 --> 36:18.800
Lyra, grab the alethiometer!

36:20.320 --> 36:22.240
You are so like I was.

36:23.720 --> 36:25.520
I am...

36:25.520 --> 36:28.000
..nothing like you.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.120
What would your mother say?

36:40.120 --> 36:41.240
What?

36:49.120 --> 36:52.160
How is she, your mother?

36:52.160 --> 36:56.040
Awful to think what could happen
to someone so...

36:57.120 --> 36:58.800
..vulnerable.

36:58.800 --> 37:00.160
Argh!

37:22.720 --> 37:25.880
Agh! Agh!

37:25.880 --> 37:27.400
Agh! Lyra!

37:38.680 --> 37:40.680
Agh!

37:58.680 --> 38:01.160
Lyra, I've got it, come on!

38:01.160 --> 38:02.800
Lyra, we need to go!

38:05.120 --> 38:06.400
Lyra, quick!

38:16.440 --> 38:17.640
Lyra!

38:19.480 --> 38:22.240
Lyra!

38:30.600 --> 38:32.200
Hey.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.160
Made you some coffee.

38:35.160 --> 38:36.200
Thanks.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.200
Thank you, Will.

38:49.320 --> 38:51.320
No problem.

38:52.360 --> 38:53.400
Easy.

39:00.400 --> 39:03.920
When I heard him hurting you,
I wanted to kill him.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.560
So that was your mother?

39:13.280 --> 39:15.720
I've never seen you
like that before.

39:18.200 --> 39:20.600
She can seem so good sometimes.

39:22.160 --> 39:25.120
And I want to believe it,
but I mustn't.

39:25.120 --> 39:28.400
Once, she used her daemon

39:28.400 --> 39:30.600
to hurt Pan, to hurt me.

39:35.280 --> 39:38.760
I'm always scared something bad's
happening to my mum.

39:43.720 --> 39:45.760
But never that she'll hurt me.

39:46.840 --> 39:49.120
It may sound strange, but...

39:50.720 --> 39:53.640
..I hope I'm not like either
of my parents.

39:53.640 --> 39:56.880
It didn't feel good,
acting like she did.

39:58.680 --> 39:59.800
I hope I'm like...

40:01.600 --> 40:02.640
..Ma Costa...

40:04.040 --> 40:05.800
..or Lee Scoresby.

40:05.800 --> 40:08.440
Lyra, you don't need to be
like anyone else.

40:09.680 --> 40:11.840
They'd be lucky to be anything
like you.

40:19.760 --> 40:22.040
Well, now that we've
got this back...

40:24.000 --> 40:26.720
..I will do nothing
but help you find your father.

40:30.560 --> 40:32.000
Promise.

40:33.560 --> 40:37.480
You offered her the alethiometer.

40:37.480 --> 40:39.160
Well, you failed to tell me

40:39.160 --> 40:42.000
that they had a knife
that could cut between worlds.

40:46.640 --> 40:49.480
They're gone.
We can't go after them.

40:49.480 --> 40:51.880
We have to. We can't.

40:51.880 --> 40:54.720
The crossroad world
we passed through...

41:00.120 --> 41:02.200
..is for the Spectres.

41:04.240 --> 41:05.560
Spectres?

41:05.560 --> 41:08.280
Until recently,
the knife was guarded closely,

41:08.280 --> 41:10.520
impossible to get to.

41:10.520 --> 41:14.200
Now the city is deserted,
plagued by Spectres.

41:14.200 --> 41:16.840
They consume everything
that makes us human.

41:16.840 --> 41:18.920
So is Lyra in danger?

41:18.920 --> 41:20.800
The Spectres ignore children.

41:22.440 --> 41:23.840
Tell me more.

41:23.840 --> 41:27.760
They attack and kill adults
in seconds.

41:32.800 --> 41:35.080
Dust...

41:37.040 --> 41:40.320
There's nothing to be done.
No human can survive there.

41:45.240 --> 41:46.720
You're wrong, Carlo.

41:49.240 --> 41:51.520
Once you understand something...

41:52.680 --> 41:54.360
..you can master it.

41:55.720 --> 41:57.720
And we have no choice but to try.

42:01.520 --> 42:02.960
Or...

42:04.760 --> 42:07.040
..are you going to admit defeat

42:07.040 --> 42:09.880
and let an adolescent take
that knife from you?

42:11.560 --> 42:13.120
Hm?

42:23.000 --> 42:24.800
Deceive the guardian...

42:26.160 --> 42:27.360
OK.

42:28.480 --> 42:29.800
OK...

42:43.520 --> 42:45.400
This is private property.

42:45.400 --> 42:48.400
Yes, I'm supposed to be here.

42:48.400 --> 42:51.120
Where's your Latrom security pass?

42:51.120 --> 42:53.640
Latrom security pass...

42:56.480 --> 42:58.280
