13:51.708 --> 13:52.708
That's mine.

13:52.792 --> 13:53.958
The rest were stolen.

13:54.041 --> 13:55.500
Why would somebody do that?

13:55.583 --> 13:56.667
I've had complaints.

in front of this thing.

anything yet,

14:02.541 --> 14:04.041

common sense stuff.

they were a real couple.

for each other.

do what you do in the bedroom,

Come on, Francis.

25:51.458 --> 25:52.875
Here we go, here we go.

25:52.958 --> 25:56.375
Come on, Frankie. You want
your daddy? Come on.

25:56.458 --> 25:57.792
What can I say?

25:58.792 --> 26:01.375

26:01.458 --> 26:05.541

26:05.625 --> 26:09.416
C'mon buddy! Jack of all trades.

26:09.500 --> 26:10.958
Whatever it takes.

26:14.999 --> 26:17.208
We're not exactly setting
the world on fire here.

26:17.291 --> 26:18.833
Well, there's a lot
of competition.

26:18.917 --> 26:20.166
Fuck you.

26:20.249 --> 26:22.208
Hey. Machshaifeh.

26:22.291 --> 26:24.667
This business is set to make
three hundred million dollars

26:24.750 --> 26:26.416
in retail next year.
I want a taste.

26:26.500 --> 26:28.708
Okay, so why don't you lower
the prices for the convention?

26:28.792 --> 26:30.041
-HARVEY: Right.
-You could print up

26:30.124 --> 26:31.124
some coupons.

26:31.208 --> 26:32.833
No profit,
we make it up in volume.

Who the fuck are they?

26:46.708 --> 26:48.166

26:48.249 --> 26:50.249
Made a film, Let Me Tell Ya
'Bout White Chicks.

26:50.333 --> 26:52.999
It's a bunch of fuck scenes
set to music, but it sells.

26:53.917 --> 26:55.291
Why? Sounds like loops.

26:55.375 --> 26:57.958
Well, whatever it is,
they're hot as fire.

26:58.041 --> 26:59.792
Why are they dressed like that?

26:59.875 --> 27:02.041
HARVEY: In public,
they come dressed as pimps.

27:02.124 --> 27:03.958
-It's marketing.
-CANDY: Marketing?

27:04.041 --> 27:07.291
Any pimp I ever knew
would sell those guys for parts.

27:07.375 --> 27:09.792
Well look, they're idiots,
but they're geniuses.

27:09.875 --> 27:13.667
They have a new one coming out,
uh, New Wave Hookers.

27:13.750 --> 27:15.667
Everyone's talking it up.

27:15.750 --> 27:17.083
They're doing a screening
tonight.

27:17.166 --> 27:18.500
You know, we should go.

27:18.583 --> 27:20.291
See how people actually
make a buck with this shit.

Yeah, we'll send 'em right over

27:31.958 --> 27:33.917
But I gotta warn you 'bout
one thing,

27:33.999 --> 27:35.458
if you wanna screw
these bitches

27:35.541 --> 27:37.458
you gotta be playing
that New Wave music.

27:37.541 --> 27:40.208
Now if you play it for 'em,
they'll fuck you all day,

27:40.291 --> 27:44.249

We did pretty good today.

29:42.958 --> 29:44.583
Yeah, we did-- we did
pretty good,

29:44.667 --> 29:47.708
-and we sold a few tapes.
-Come on. We're doing fine.

29:47.792 --> 29:51.416
The retail price points on
the tapes are coming down, huh?

29:51.500 --> 29:53.083
What's that gonna mean?

29:53.166 --> 29:55.958
Less profit.
It means we have to be smarter.

29:56.041 --> 29:57.583
The P and A on the theatrical,

29:57.667 --> 29:59.124
it puts you in the red

29:59.208 --> 30:00.917
It helps with video sales,

30:00.999 --> 30:04.999
but, uh, it's not-- not enough
to justify the expense. So...

30:09.208 --> 30:12.875
So we're going straight
to video.

30:15.958 --> 30:17.708
-Eileen...
-CANDY: Yeah?

30:18.999 --> 30:21.208

as well.

30:21.291 --> 30:22.625
Into what?

30:22.708 --> 30:24.708
Well, you saw the same film
I did.

30:39.416 --> 30:40.792
I had to make that kind
of trash,

30:40.875 --> 30:42.750
I would get
the fuck out of porn.

-Well.
-CANDY: Harvey,

30:44.458 --> 30:47.500
girls hear new wave music
and they lose their minds

30:47.583 --> 30:49.041
and they become fuckholes

willing to do anything
to please men?

30:50.999 --> 30:52.124
That's your story?

30:52.208 --> 30:53.958
I have to turn product.

30:55.291 --> 30:57.708
And our customers are men.

30:57.792 --> 31:01.291
-Our customers are not all men.
-They are mostly men.

who's taking pictures?

-Wasserman...
-Men.

31:13.750 --> 31:15.375
You motherfucker. Are we--
Are we still having

31:15.458 --> 31:16.833
this same goddamn conversation

31:16.958 --> 31:18.249
-after all these years?
-Listen.

31:18.333 --> 31:20.041
You are
a good filmmaker.

31:20.124 --> 31:24.625
But the feminist porn shit
is a niche product

31:24.708 --> 31:29.041
that I can no longer invest in.
Okay?

31:29.124 --> 31:32.208
It is negatively impacting
our balance sheet.

31:32.291 --> 31:33.792
I'm huge in Europe.

31:34.875 --> 31:36.291
So, go to Europe.

31:36.375 --> 31:38.249
Find a European investor.

31:38.333 --> 31:40.500
Or start making a different
kind of film.

31:40.583 --> 31:41.625
Straight porn?

31:42.833 --> 31:44.500
Like everybody else?

31:46.583 --> 31:48.083

-I'm gonna go home.
-Candy.

32:05.166 --> 32:06.541
I'm gonna catch a plane
tomorrow.

32:06.625 --> 32:08.041
Truth is, I need to see my mom.

32:08.124 --> 32:10.041
I'd rather spend New Year's
in New York.

32:28.999 --> 32:31.416
Oh! Where you been, stranger?

32:31.500 --> 32:32.500

32:47.416 --> 32:48.500
You okay?

32:50.166 --> 32:51.750
I don't know.

32:51.833 --> 32:57.917
I got a fever. I can't trick.
I definitely can't dance.

32:57.999 --> 32:59.208
Where you stayin'?

32:59.750 --> 33:00.958
Depends.

33:01.041 --> 33:04.416
Sometimes I crash at the couch
at Show Land.

33:05.500 --> 33:07.249
Frankie's cool about it,

33:08.875 --> 33:10.625
but...

33:10.708 --> 33:12.999
not the other girls sometimes.

33:13.083 --> 33:14.708
Where are you now?

33:14.792 --> 33:18.291
Tonight? I'll figure it out.

33:18.375 --> 33:21.041
-ABBY: Shay.
-Oh. Hey, Abby.

33:23.166 --> 33:25.708
I have to stop by the clinic.
I won't be long.

33:34.208 --> 33:35.750
Cherries for the pretty lady.

33:37.333 --> 33:39.667
Doc, what about that thing
on my backside? Could that be...

33:39.750 --> 33:42.667
-It's an ingrown hair.
-You sure it's not...

33:42.750 --> 33:43.917
Positive.

33:47.667 --> 33:49.500

all the homosexuals

33:51.583 --> 33:53.541
Like, I don't have nothin'
to worry about...

33:53.625 --> 33:56.083
It's not an airborne disease,
Mr. Dwyer.

33:56.166 --> 33:59.333
You can't get it from brushing
against someone on the subway.

33:59.416 --> 34:01.041
This we know.

34:01.124 --> 34:03.416
Seems like nobody knows nothin',
really.

34:07.083 --> 34:09.667
Can I talk to you... straight?

34:11.291 --> 34:14.124
I'm in an environment,
at work,

34:14.208 --> 34:16.792
I mean, where, uh...

34:17.625 --> 34:18.999
I'm around a lot of women.

34:20.291 --> 34:21.708
There's...

34:21.792 --> 34:22.958
temptation.

34:24.124 --> 34:25.875
Not that I don't love my wife...

34:25.958 --> 34:27.375
You've had affairs?

34:27.458 --> 34:28.999
It's gonna sound like a lot,

34:29.083 --> 34:30.958
on account of it's spread out
over ten years or so,

34:31.041 --> 34:32.958
but yeah, I've made mistakes.

34:35.166 --> 34:37.375
Hundreds of mistakes, okay?

34:37.458 --> 34:39.917
All women.
I just want to make that clear.

34:39.999 --> 34:43.291
Well. The virus is
sexually transmitted.

34:43.375 --> 34:45.333
You should always wear a condom,
of course,

34:45.416 --> 34:46.792
and, if possible,

34:46.875 --> 34:50.166
you should probably withdraw
before ejaculation.

34:50.249 --> 34:53.291
Use lubricant to prevent
tearing. And no rimming.

34:53.375 --> 34:54.792
What. What's that?

34:54.875 --> 34:57.041
Putting your tongue around
the edges of the anus

34:57.124 --> 34:58.333
or inside it.

34:58.416 --> 35:00.124
Why the fuck would I do that?

35:04.041 --> 35:06.041
You're gonna test that blood
you took, right?

35:06.124 --> 35:08.083
For a reading of
your T-cell count, yes.

35:08.166 --> 35:10.458
The results will come back
in a couple of days.

35:10.541 --> 35:13.416
Uh, maybe longer,
because of the holiday.

35:13.500 --> 35:17.750
That'll tell you if I have
the disease? The tea stuff?

35:17.833 --> 35:19.792
You can't get the test back
today?

35:19.875 --> 35:20.958
No.

35:22.166 --> 35:23.625
Fuck me.

35:23.708 --> 35:25.333
Can I give you a little advice?

35:26.958 --> 35:28.458
If you're so concerned
about this,

35:28.541 --> 35:31.750
you should probably consider
practicing monogamy

35:31.833 --> 35:33.291
going forward.

35:33.375 --> 35:37.249

36:20.917 --> 36:22.792
We drew a lot more

Well, I had a companion.

53:03.541 --> 53:06.625
But I managed to drop her off
before midnight,

53:06.708 --> 53:09.750
sparing us both
a very awkward moment.
