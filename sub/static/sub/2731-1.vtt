00:47.766 --> 00:52.770
So good of you to come see me, Mr. Bond.
Particularly on such short notice.

00:53.939 --> 00:56.941
If you can't trust a Swiss banker,
what's the world come to?

00:58.151 --> 01:02.071
And now that we're all comfortable,
why don't you sit down?

01:04.114 --> 01:07.618
It was not easy,
but I have retrieved the money.

01:08.620 --> 01:11.705
No doubt, Sir Robert will be
pleased to see it again.

01:12.290 --> 01:15.251
At the current rate of exchange,
minus the fees

01:15.335 --> 01:18.003
and certain unforeseeable expenses.

01:19.089 --> 01:22.716
- VoilÃ , the receipt.
- Would you like to check my figures?

01:24.594 --> 01:26.804
Oh, I'm sure they're perfectly rounded.

01:28.306 --> 01:31.141
- It's all there.
- I didn't come for the money.

01:32.477 --> 01:36.647
The report Sir Robert bought was stolen
from an Ml6 agent who was killed for it.

01:40.819 --> 01:42.069
I want to know who killed him.

01:42.153 --> 01:44.905
- Terrible tragedy.
- I just want a name.

01:45.115 --> 01:48.450
I am merely the middleman.
I'm just trying to do the honorable thing,

01:48.535 --> 01:50.995
returning the money to its rightful owner.

01:51.621 --> 01:54.582
And we know how difficult that can be
for a Swiss banker.

02:00.046 --> 02:03.882
I am offering you the opportunity
to walk out with the money, Mr. Bond.

02:04.175 --> 02:07.428
And I'm giving you the opportunity
to walk out with your life.

02:07.846 --> 02:10.806
Looking at our present situation,
strictly as a banker,

02:10.889 --> 02:14.268
I would have to say
that the numbers are not on your side.

02:14.978 --> 02:20.065
Perhaps you failed to take into account
my hidden assets.

02:30.702 --> 02:32.995
You seem to have had
a small reversal of fortune.

02:33.913 --> 02:36.040
- Give me the name.
- I can't tell you.

02:36.207 --> 02:37.875
Let's count to three.

02:38.668 --> 02:43.881
You can do that, can't you? One, two...

02:45.175 --> 02:47.718
All right. All right.
But you'll have to protect me.

04:48.006 --> 04:51.341
James. Have you brought me
a souvenir from your trip?

04:51.801 --> 04:54.178
Chocolates? An engagement ring?

04:55.638 --> 04:57.514
I thought you'd enjoy one of these.

04:58.975 --> 05:00.225
How romantic.

05:02.812 --> 05:04.480
I know exactly where to put that.

05:08.943 --> 05:10.527
Oh, Moneypenny,

05:10.695 --> 05:15.073
the story of our relationship.
Close, but no cigar.

05:15.658 --> 05:18.202
I hate to tear you away
from affairs of state, 007.

05:18.286 --> 05:19.411
Would you mind coming in?

05:21.873 --> 05:23.207
Right away, M.

05:25.418 --> 05:27.127
Sir Robert King, James Bond.

05:28.421 --> 05:32.216
The man who retrieved my money.
I can't thank you enough. Excellent work.

05:33.134 --> 05:35.177
Be careful, M.
I might try to steal him from you.

05:35.261 --> 05:38.388
Construction's not exactly my speciality.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.390
Quite the opposite, in fact.

05:41.726 --> 05:42.976
Best to the family.

05:48.066 --> 05:51.610
- Old friend?
- We read law at Oxford together.

05:52.904 --> 05:56.949
I always knew he'd conquer the world.
Care for a drink?

05:57.242 --> 05:58.534
Yes, thank you.

05:59.744 --> 06:01.787
He's a man of great integrity.

06:02.247 --> 06:04.915
Who buys stolen reports
for three million pounds.

06:05.834 --> 06:06.917
Thank you.

06:08.169 --> 06:10.921
- Any leads on the sniper?
- Not one.

06:11.256 --> 06:14.424
Professional job.
She must be working for someone.

06:15.301 --> 06:17.678
- Is this the stolen report?
- Yes. Classified.

06:17.762 --> 06:19.680
From the Russian
Atomic Energy Department.

06:19.764 --> 06:21.348
What would King want this for?

06:21.975 --> 06:25.018
He was led to believe the document was
a secret report

06:25.103 --> 06:26.478
identifying the terrorists

06:26.563 --> 06:29.773
who'd attacked a new oil pipeline
he's building in the region.

06:30.275 --> 06:31.441
Interesting.

06:32.902 --> 06:34.069
But it doesn't exactly explain

06:34.153 --> 06:36.488
why someone would want me
out of their office alive.

06:45.164 --> 06:49.293
- King! The money.
- Moneypenny, stop King.

06:57.468 --> 06:59.928
Move! Move, move! Get out of the way!

07:04.767 --> 07:06.059
Stop!

07:42.889 --> 07:46.600
Move! Move! Get out of the way!
Get out of the way! Move!

07:54.692 --> 07:57.819
Stop, stop! It isn't finished!

11:41.836 --> 11:43.211
What was that?

13:03.918 --> 13:05.085
Let's go!

13:05.294 --> 13:07.254
- What the hell do you think you're...
- Let go!

13:36.325 --> 13:39.286
Listen to me! You can't get away.

13:39.537 --> 13:41.997
We can make a deal.
Just tell me who's behind this.

13:42.081 --> 13:44.666
Who are you working for? Don't do it!

13:44.750 --> 13:47.544
Don't blow us up! I can protect you.

13:47.628 --> 13:49.963
Do you understand? I can protect you.

13:50.047 --> 13:51.423
Not from him!

17:19.589 --> 17:20.757
Hello, my dear.

17:33.604 --> 17:36.940
- Who is that young woman?
- King's daughter.

17:38.275 --> 17:40.777
- Elektra.
- Thank you.

17:43.781 --> 17:45.949
The money was dipped in urea.

17:47.117 --> 17:49.118
In effect, a highly compacted
fertilizer bomb.

17:49.203 --> 17:51.913
Having handled the money,
the water on 007's hands

17:51.997 --> 17:54.832
when he touched the ice
started a chemical reaction.

17:54.917 --> 17:57.669
In one of the notes,
the metal anti-counterfeiting strip

17:57.753 --> 18:00.630
had been replaced with magnesium,
which acted as a detonator.

18:00.714 --> 18:04.259
And King's lapel pin
was switched for a copy

18:04.343 --> 18:07.929
which contained a radio transmitter
to trigger the blast.

18:08.013 --> 18:12.183
In other words,
he set off the bomb that killed him.

18:12.268 --> 18:14.519
We know it was someone close to King,

18:15.187 --> 18:17.897
and our only lead committed suicide
on that balloon.

18:18.399 --> 18:23.111
But given the size of King's organization,
it could be anyone, anywhere.

18:24.154 --> 18:25.154
M.

18:27.992 --> 18:29.659
This will not stand.

18:30.828 --> 18:34.163
We will not be terrorized by cowards
who'd murder an innocent man

18:34.248 --> 18:35.665
and use us as the tool.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.042
We'll find the people
who committed this atrocity.

18:38.210 --> 18:41.504
We'll follow them to the farthest ends
of the earth, if needs be.

18:42.631 --> 18:44.757
And we will bring them to justice.

18:58.355 --> 18:59.439
Tanner!

18:59.523 --> 19:01.691
Sorry, James.
M says you're off the active-duty list

19:01.775 --> 19:03.526
until you're cleared by medical.

19:09.241 --> 19:10.908
Dislocated collarbone.

19:11.118 --> 19:14.621
If any more tendons snap, I'm afraid
you're going to be out of action for weeks.

19:18.334 --> 19:22.045
Molly, I need a clean bill of health.

19:23.047 --> 19:25.048
You have to clear me for duty.

19:25.883 --> 19:29.927
- James, that wouldn't really be...
- Ethical?

19:31.138 --> 19:33.765
Practical, smart.

19:34.683 --> 19:38.728
Well, let's just skirt the issue, shall we?

19:41.857 --> 19:45.318
You'd have to promise to call me
this time.

19:46.195 --> 19:48.196
Whatever the doctor orders.

19:49.406 --> 19:52.200
Then I suppose,
if you stayed in constant contact...

19:52.409 --> 19:53.534
Of course.

19:53.827 --> 19:56.454
If you showed sufficient stamina.

19:57.414 --> 20:01.000
- Cut out all kinds of...
- Strenuous activity?

20:22.898 --> 20:26.150
I suppose we all have to
pay the piper sometime, right, Q?

20:26.360 --> 20:28.528
Oh, pipe down, 007.

20:29.363 --> 20:33.908
- Was it something I said?
- No. Something you destroyed.

20:33.992 --> 20:38.871
My fishing boat
for my retirement away from you.

20:41.583 --> 20:45.002
Now, I want to introduce you
to the young fellow

20:45.087 --> 20:47.296
I'm grooming to follow me.

20:58.976 --> 21:00.601
Helps if you open the door.

21:01.812 --> 21:05.189
- And you might be?
- This is 007!

21:05.399 --> 21:07.859
If you're Q, does that make him R?

21:07.943 --> 21:11.821
Yes, the legendary 007 wit.

21:12.740 --> 21:14.323
Or at least half of it.

21:14.408 --> 21:19.245
Now, I dare say, 007, that you've
met your match with this machine.

21:19.329 --> 21:22.832
Yeah? New model? Improved specs?

21:23.834 --> 21:26.836
I thought you were on the inactive roster.
Some kind of injury?

21:26.920 --> 21:28.963
Yes, well, we'll see about that. So?

21:29.047 --> 21:32.675
As I was saying, the very latest
in interception countermeasures.

21:33.010 --> 21:36.596
Titanium armor,
a multitasking heads-up display

21:36.680 --> 21:42.185
and six beverage cup holders.
All in all, rather stocked.

21:42.853 --> 21:46.355
- "Fully loaded," I think is the term.
- I think...

21:46.440 --> 21:50.026
You're not here to think.
You're here to do what I tell you.

21:50.360 --> 21:54.197
Now, go put on the coat
and demonstrate it for 007.

21:54.490 --> 21:55.865
But of course.

21:56.158 --> 21:58.993
Now, watch closely, please, 007.

21:59.828 --> 22:02.872
The right arm goes
in the right sleeve, thus.

22:02.956 --> 22:06.626
And the left arm in the left sleeve, thus.

22:06.710 --> 22:10.254
Now, note closely, please,
pockets, poppers and zipper.

22:10.714 --> 22:14.175
Take the lower part of the zipper
and insert it into the...

22:14.259 --> 22:15.885
Pull the tag.

22:17.846 --> 22:19.055
You said...

22:24.228 --> 22:26.437
He seems well-suited for the job.

22:28.774 --> 22:34.195
You're not retiring anytime soon,
are you?

22:34.571 --> 22:36.447
Now, pay attention, 007.

22:36.865 --> 22:39.075
I've always tried to teach you two things.

22:39.368 --> 22:42.161
First, never let them see you bleed.

22:42.955 --> 22:46.707
- And the second?
- Always have an escape plan.

23:00.514 --> 23:04.100
Good evening.
The Elektra King kidnap ordeal is over.

23:04.560 --> 23:07.019
The Cyprus authorities say
she has escaped

23:07.104 --> 23:10.314
after shooting dead
two of her captors and is...

23:14.528 --> 23:15.653
He shouted.

23:18.532 --> 23:20.324
Shouted all the time.

24:11.668 --> 24:13.502
Level one, clearance required.

24:14.713 --> 24:16.339
Level one, clearance required.

24:21.595 --> 24:22.845
Yes, 007?

24:23.430 --> 24:25.890
Tell me about the kidnapping
of Elektra King.

24:26.099 --> 24:28.517
I wasn't aware you had an assignment
on this case.

24:28.769 --> 24:30.770
I brought the money in that killed King.

24:31.438 --> 24:34.315
- Don't make this personal.
- I'm not. Are you?

24:37.736 --> 24:40.154
You're the only one
who could seal her file.

24:43.909 --> 24:45.368
Will you excuse us?

24:52.376 --> 24:55.044
I will not tolerate insubordination, 007.

25:02.302 --> 25:03.386
What happened?

25:06.431 --> 25:09.225
After Elektra King was kidnapped,

25:10.143 --> 25:14.730
her father tried to deal with it on his own,
with no success.

25:16.483 --> 25:17.942
So he came to me.

25:29.037 --> 25:32.581
As you are aware,
we do not negotiate with terrorists.

25:34.584 --> 25:40.756
And against every instinct in my heart,
every emotion as a mother,

25:41.258 --> 25:45.761
I told him not to pay the ransom.
I thought we had time on our side.

25:48.598 --> 25:50.349
You used the girl as bait.

25:53.145 --> 25:54.145
Yes.

25:55.022 --> 25:57.898
The money in King's briefcase
was precisely the same amount

25:58.859 --> 26:01.152
as the ransom demand for his daughter.

26:07.325 --> 26:11.746
It's a message. Your terrorist is back.

26:18.879 --> 26:24.467
- Victor Zokas, a.k.a...
- Renard, the anarchist.

26:24.634 --> 26:28.888
He was operating in Moscow in 1996.
Pyongyang, North Korea, before that.

26:28.972 --> 26:32.725
And he's been spotted
in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Iraq, Iran,

26:32.809 --> 26:34.977
Beirut and Cambodia.

26:35.854 --> 26:40.191
- All the romantic vacation spots.
- His only goal is chaos.

26:40.650 --> 26:43.903
After Robert came to me,
I sent 009 to kill Renard.

26:44.654 --> 26:47.656
Before he completed the mission,
Elektra escaped.

26:48.867 --> 26:51.077
A week later,
our man caught up with the target.

26:51.495 --> 26:54.830
He put a bullet in his head.
That bullet's still there.

26:56.124 --> 26:57.416
How did he survive?

26:58.043 --> 27:00.544
The doctor who saved Renard
couldn't get the bullet out,

27:00.796 --> 27:02.338
so Renard killed him.

27:03.548 --> 27:06.008
It's moving through
the medulla oblongata,

27:06.093 --> 27:09.553
killing off his senses, touch, smell.

27:09.638 --> 27:11.222
He feels no pain.

27:11.306 --> 27:14.558
He can push himself harder, longer
than any normal man.

27:14.893 --> 27:16.393
The bullet will kill him,

27:16.478 --> 27:19.688
but he'll grow stronger every day,
until the day he dies.

27:24.027 --> 27:27.404
Robert is dead. Ml6 is humiliated.

27:27.948 --> 27:29.448
He's had his revenge.

27:31.326 --> 27:32.535
Not quite.

27:33.495 --> 27:35.913
Renard had three enemies
in that kidnapping,

27:37.124 --> 27:39.208
and there's still one he hasn't touched.

27:41.044 --> 27:42.211
Elektra.

27:44.214 --> 27:45.214
M.

27:48.510 --> 27:52.721
I see the good doctor has cleared you.
Notes you have exceptional stamina.

27:54.057 --> 27:56.267
I'm sure she was touched
by his dedication

27:58.478 --> 28:00.187
to the job in hand.

28:02.524 --> 28:04.650
007, I want you to go to Elektra.

28:05.402 --> 28:09.321
She's taken over the construction of
her father's oil pipeline in the Caspian Sea.

28:09.406 --> 28:11.407
Find who switched that pin.

28:11.825 --> 28:14.243
If your instincts are right,
Renard will be back,

28:14.911 --> 28:16.829
and Elektra will be the next target.

28:17.706 --> 28:19.206
The worm on the hook again.

28:19.291 --> 28:22.168
She doesn't need to know
it's the same man that may be after her.

28:22.252 --> 28:23.627
Don't frighten her.

28:23.920 --> 28:25.671
A shadow operation?

28:25.797 --> 28:29.425
Remember, shadows stay
in front or behind,

28:30.218 --> 28:31.468
never on top.

29:33.949 --> 29:36.700
You, go back. Leave. This area is closed.

29:36.910 --> 29:38.786
I'm here to see Elektra King.

29:38.995 --> 29:41.163
James Bond, Universal Exports.

29:41.331 --> 29:43.707
And I'm Davidov, chief of security.

29:43.917 --> 29:46.669
As you can see, we're having
some problems with the villagers.

29:47.796 --> 29:50.798
I told Miss King to stay
at the office in Baku.

29:51.925 --> 29:53.175
Oh, hell.

30:13.488 --> 30:16.532
- Miss King, I told you to stay...
- I know what you told me.

31:03.788 --> 31:05.080
Send the pipe around.

31:05.165 --> 31:07.791
It's going to take weeks and cost millions.

31:08.001 --> 31:11.587
- Your father approved this route.
- Then my father was wrong. Do it.

31:12.756 --> 31:14.465
- Davidov.
- I'll talk to her.

31:18.303 --> 31:20.512
I saw you at my father's funeral.

31:21.014 --> 31:23.265
Yes. I'm sorry.

31:24.100 --> 31:27.102
M told me she was sending someone. Mr...

31:27.771 --> 31:30.272
Bond. James Bond.

31:32.609 --> 31:36.737
- Did you know my father?
- I met him once, briefly.

31:37.655 --> 31:40.366
You seem to have inherited
his touch for diplomacy.

31:40.575 --> 31:44.119
- Saving the church?
- And avoiding the bloodshed.

31:44.788 --> 31:48.415
A hundred years ago, my mother's family
discovered the oil here.

31:48.625 --> 31:50.959
When the Soviet Union was formed,

31:51.294 --> 31:55.798
the Communists spent the next 70 years
plundering our countryside for it.

31:56.633 --> 31:58.967
I saw the mess they left on the drive in.

31:59.427 --> 32:02.179
The new pipeline
will guarantee our future.

32:03.473 --> 32:06.975
But it would be a crime to destroy
what little is left of our past.

32:13.400 --> 32:16.026
But you didn't come here
to talk about oil, did you?

32:16.111 --> 32:17.111
No.

32:17.737 --> 32:18.904
Tell me,

32:21.908 --> 32:24.451
have you ever lost a loved one, Mr. Bond?

32:27.497 --> 32:30.416
M sent me because we're afraid
your life might be in danger.

32:34.337 --> 32:36.922
Please, I want to show you something.

32:37.382 --> 32:41.552
I'm trying to build an 800-mile
pipeline through Turkey,

32:42.011 --> 32:46.348
past the terrorists in Iraq, Iran and Syria.

32:46.724 --> 32:50.686
Up here, the Russians have
three competing pipelines.

32:50.770 --> 32:52.938
And they'll do anything to stop me.

32:53.356 --> 32:56.733
My father was murdered,
the villagers are rioting,

32:57.402 --> 33:01.864
and you, Mr. Bond, have come all this way
to tell me that I "might" be in danger?

33:05.702 --> 33:07.995
We suspect there might be an insider.

33:10.498 --> 33:13.333
- My father's pin.
- No, a duplicate

33:13.960 --> 33:16.962
with a transmitter inside
that set off the bomb.

33:17.213 --> 33:20.424
My family has relied
on Ml6 twice, Mr. Bond.

33:20.884 --> 33:23.051
I won't make that mistake a third time.

33:26.890 --> 33:29.308
I'm going to finish building this pipeline,

33:29.392 --> 33:31.143
and I don't need your help.

33:31.561 --> 33:34.646
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to check the survey lines.

33:34.731 --> 33:37.149
I've always wanted to
check the survey lines.

33:37.984 --> 33:40.152
You don't take no for an answer, do you?

33:40.653 --> 33:41.653
No.

33:44.240 --> 33:46.408
I hope you know how to ski, then.

33:47.744 --> 33:50.245
I came prepared for a cold reception.

34:07.597 --> 34:09.931
Can't land. Wind's too strong.

34:10.725 --> 34:11.850
Hold her steady.

35:19.377 --> 35:23.255
- You ski very well, Mr. Bond.
- Seems you enjoy being chased.

35:24.215 --> 35:28.051
- It probably happens all the time.
- Less often than you might think.

35:29.012 --> 35:32.556
So this is where they meet,
the two ends of the pipeline.

35:33.099 --> 35:34.433
Your father's legacy.

35:34.642 --> 35:38.020
My family's legacy to the world.

35:48.364 --> 35:50.866
- Expecting visitors?
- No.

35:58.499 --> 36:00.500
This isn't a social call.

36:01.002 --> 36:04.546
Head for the gully.
I'll lead them into the trees. Go, go!

38:07.044 --> 38:08.837
See you back at the lodge.

39:28.292 --> 39:29.501
- Oh, my God!
- It's all right.

39:29.585 --> 39:31.419
- We're buried alive!
- It's all right!

39:34.006 --> 39:38.093
- I can't stay here!
- You're not going to. You're not going to.

39:39.595 --> 39:40.971
- Elektra.
- I can't breathe.

39:41.055 --> 39:43.723
- Elektra, Elektra, Elektra!
- I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

39:43.808 --> 39:46.935
Look at me. Elektra, look at me!
Look at my eyes.

39:47.103 --> 39:49.938
Look at my eyes. Look at my eyes!

39:50.731 --> 39:51.982
You're all right.

39:53.234 --> 39:57.445
Everything's all right. Trust me. Okay?

40:26.225 --> 40:27.225
She's fine.

40:27.310 --> 40:29.561
Some bumps and bruises,
but otherwise fine.

40:29.645 --> 40:32.147
She wants to see you.
Not you, Davidov, him.

40:46.412 --> 40:49.915
- Are you all right?
- I need to ask you something.

40:51.292 --> 40:53.543
And I want you to tell me the truth.

40:53.753 --> 40:56.922
Who is it? Who's trying to kill me?

40:57.965 --> 41:01.760
I told you I don't know.
But I'm gonna find him.

41:02.970 --> 41:04.179
Not good enough.

41:06.140 --> 41:08.683
After the kidnapping, I was afraid.

41:09.185 --> 41:11.603
I was afraid to go outside.
I was afraid to be alone.

41:11.687 --> 41:14.022
I was afraid to be in a crowd.

41:14.774 --> 41:16.858
I was afraid to do anything at all.

41:16.984 --> 41:21.029
Until I realized
I can't hide in the shadows.

41:21.614 --> 41:25.367
I can't let fear run my life. I won't.

41:26.869 --> 41:30.747
After I find him, you won't have to.

41:33.334 --> 41:36.878
Don't go. Stay with me.

41:39.382 --> 41:40.507
Please?

41:45.179 --> 41:46.554
I can't do that.

41:47.598 --> 41:49.683
I thought it was your job to protect me.

41:52.478 --> 41:55.730
- You'll be safe here.
- I don't want to be safe.

42:03.322 --> 42:04.864
I'll be back soon.

42:06.909 --> 42:09.411
And who's afraid now, Mr. Bond?

43:21.317 --> 43:25.320
- I want to see Valentin Zukovsky.
- Impossible.

43:26.614 --> 43:30.075
Vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred.

43:32.161 --> 43:34.120
Tell him James Bond is here.

43:35.539 --> 43:36.706
Now.

43:42.505 --> 43:44.422
I don't think you heard me.

43:54.225 --> 43:56.768
Mr. Zukovsky would be delighted
to see you.

44:01.649 --> 44:05.693
- After you.
- No. After you.

44:06.904 --> 44:08.655
I insist.

44:11.158 --> 44:12.742
And a little for you.

44:16.038 --> 44:17.831
Bond! James Bond!

44:18.541 --> 44:21.751
Meet Nina and Verushka.

44:23.045 --> 44:26.381
Lose the girls, Valentin. We need to talk.

44:26.882 --> 44:31.219
Why am I suddenly worried
that I'm not carrying enough insurance?

44:31.428 --> 44:32.846
Chill out, James.

44:37.268 --> 44:39.727
Fine, ladies. Go on. Beat it. Scram.

44:39.895 --> 44:41.813
Bull, give them an inch.

44:49.029 --> 44:51.906
And make sure they lose it in this casino.

44:54.076 --> 44:55.994
I'll see you later, Mr. Bond.

44:56.203 --> 44:58.413
I see you put your money
where your mouth is.

44:59.248 --> 45:03.376
Mr. Bullion does not trust banks.
So, what would you like to talk about?

45:04.003 --> 45:07.755
I'm not sure I can really help you.
I'm a legitimate businessman now.

45:10.134 --> 45:13.720
Would you care for some caviar?
My own brand, Zukovsky's Finest.

45:15.139 --> 45:16.472
Take a look at this.

45:19.268 --> 45:21.311
Russian Special Services.

45:22.688 --> 45:26.816
Atomic Energy Antiterrorist Unit.
Where did you find this?

45:27.026 --> 45:30.778
I took it off a parahawk which tried to
kill Elektra King this morning.

45:31.614 --> 45:33.281
Renard is behind this.

45:38.746 --> 45:41.331
I think you and I had better have a drink.

45:47.254 --> 45:48.963
And then after Afghanistan,

45:49.048 --> 45:53.384
the KGB decided Renard was a liability
and just cut him loose.

45:53.469 --> 45:56.471
- Now he works freelance.
- But for whom?

45:57.973 --> 45:59.891
There are four competing pipelines.

46:00.100 --> 46:03.645
I'm willing to bet half the customers
in this casino would be very happy

46:03.729 --> 46:06.189
to see the King pipeline disappear.

46:08.192 --> 46:09.400
- What's funny?
- Nothing.

46:09.485 --> 46:12.987
It just appears Miss King does not share
your concern.

46:20.913 --> 46:24.749
- What are you doing here?
- The same thing you are.

46:24.875 --> 46:27.293
Looking for the people
who tried to kill me.

46:27.544 --> 46:29.671
Let me take you home. Now.

46:29.880 --> 46:32.840
No. I want them to see I'm not frightened.

46:33.008 --> 46:38.137
Miss King, how very nice to see you.
We've kept your father's chair free.

46:38.347 --> 46:41.140
Free?
Nothing comes free from you, Zukovsky.

46:42.226 --> 46:45.728
Your father had a credit line with us,
$1 million U.S.

46:46.146 --> 46:48.690
I'd be happy to extend you that courtesy.

46:52.778 --> 46:54.028
So what's it to be?

46:56.115 --> 46:58.199
Blackjack, your father's favorite?

46:59.076 --> 47:00.702
Let's keep it simple.

47:01.704 --> 47:04.122
One card. High draw.

47:08.043 --> 47:09.669
A million dollars.

47:13.340 --> 47:16.718
Wait. Bury the top three cards.

47:19.388 --> 47:21.472
You're determined to protect me,
aren't you?

47:21.557 --> 47:24.142
Perhaps from yourself.
You don't have to do this.

47:26.520 --> 47:30.064
There's no point in living
if you can't feel alive.

47:42.369 --> 47:43.661
Queen of hearts.

47:56.550 --> 48:01.262
It appears that you have been beaten
by the ace of clubs.

48:05.768 --> 48:08.811
No hard feelings, my dear.
Come again soon.

48:14.902 --> 48:16.152
Shall we?

48:16.445 --> 48:21.783
Elektra, this is a game
I can't afford to play.

48:24.745 --> 48:25.912
I know.

48:29.208 --> 48:32.210
- What happened to Davidov?
- I gave him the night off.

48:54.650 --> 48:56.609
Welcome to the Devil's Breath.

48:58.445 --> 49:01.823
For thousands of years, Hindu pilgrims
have journeyed to this holy place

49:03.742 --> 49:07.328
to witness the wonder of the miracle
of the natural flames that never die

49:08.580 --> 49:12.500
and to test their devotion to God

49:14.169 --> 49:17.171
by holding the scalding rocks
in their hands

49:20.342 --> 49:22.051
as they said their daily prayers.

49:24.054 --> 49:27.849
Tell me, Davidov,
what happened this afternoon?

49:28.016 --> 49:32.145
You promised me your best men.
Mr. Arkov supplied the latest weapons.

49:32.271 --> 49:35.356
- Yes, but Bond...
- Bond was unarmed.

49:37.693 --> 49:41.279
And you, Arkov?
Is everything ready for tomorrow?

49:41.488 --> 49:44.031
I have the authorization
and the passes in the car,

49:44.241 --> 49:46.826
and I have arranged for a plane tonight,
but...

49:47.369 --> 49:51.330
- But what?
- We should scrub the rest of the mission.

49:51.415 --> 49:54.792
The parahawks were meant
to be returned.

49:54.877 --> 49:57.211
People will start asking questions,
even of me,

49:57.296 --> 49:59.630
all because of his incompetence.

49:59.715 --> 50:03.634
I see. I see you're right.
You're right, he should be punished.

50:04.636 --> 50:06.387
Davidov, hold this for me.

50:10.684 --> 50:13.144
It was wrong of me to expect
so much of you.

50:15.230 --> 50:16.397
Kill him.

50:18.734 --> 50:20.943
He failed his test of devotion.

50:24.531 --> 50:28.034
You can take his place. Take his ID.

50:29.912 --> 50:31.579
And do be on time.

50:51.558 --> 50:53.059
Poor shoulder.

50:54.269 --> 50:55.895
It looks painful.

50:58.732 --> 51:00.608
Needs constant attention.

51:04.571 --> 51:07.865
I knew. I knew when I first saw you.

51:09.618 --> 51:11.160
I knew it would be like this.

51:23.882 --> 51:25.758
Enough ice for one day.

51:45.988 --> 51:47.989
How did you survive?

51:55.330 --> 51:58.666
I seduced the guards, used my body.

51:59.668 --> 52:01.836
It gave me control.

52:03.422 --> 52:06.340
And the rest,
I got a gun and started shooting.

52:10.137 --> 52:13.514
And what about you?
What do you do to survive?

52:18.020 --> 52:19.854
I take pleasure

52:21.607 --> 52:23.357
in great beauty.

55:02.184 --> 55:05.019
Let's go. It's getting late.

55:09.775 --> 55:13.027
What happened to Davidov?
I was told to expect him.

55:14.821 --> 55:17.114
He was buried with work.

55:18.116 --> 55:20.367
Let's go. Get your stuff.

55:32.047 --> 55:35.257
Okay, come on. Let's get out of here.

55:37.135 --> 55:41.555
You're late. Did you bring it? The grease.

55:44.893 --> 55:46.435
Of course.

55:53.360 --> 55:54.360
Excellent.

56:12.128 --> 56:14.797
Get ready. We're 10 minutes out.

56:14.881 --> 56:16.799
But make sure you wear the ID.

57:03.179 --> 57:04.889
I'm gonna go get some air.

57:22.657 --> 57:26.368
Welcome to Kazakhstan, Dr. Arkov.
I'm a great admirer of your research.

57:27.078 --> 57:30.164
Not often we see someone
of your stature here.

57:30.248 --> 57:32.499
I go where the work takes me.

57:32.584 --> 57:34.960
By the way,
you have the transport documents?

57:44.721 --> 57:47.181
I pulled the plutonium
out of the one inside.

57:47.265 --> 57:49.850
- You can detonate the triggers now.
- Okay.

57:53.521 --> 57:58.859
Look. Our IDA physicist.
Don't bother. Not interested in men.

57:58.944 --> 58:00.569
Take my word for it.

58:00.654 --> 58:02.738
Last year,
we decommissioned four test sites.

58:02.822 --> 58:04.907
Not even a glimmer.

58:09.204 --> 58:12.873
Are you here for a reason
or are you just hoping for a glimmer?

58:13.625 --> 58:14.959
And you are?

58:15.043 --> 58:18.712
Mikhail Arkov,
Russian Atomic Energy Department.

58:18.797 --> 58:23.634
- Miss...
- Dr. Jones. Christmas Jones.

58:23.718 --> 58:26.887
And don't make any jokes.
I've heard them all.

58:26.972 --> 58:29.181
I don't know any doctor jokes.

58:31.309 --> 58:34.144
This is okay.
Take the elevator down the hall.

58:34.229 --> 58:36.397
Your friends are already down there.

58:36.481 --> 58:40.651
- Don't I get some type of protection?
- No, Dr. Arkov.

58:40.735 --> 58:42.611
Down there it's all
weapons-grade plutonium.

58:42.696 --> 58:43.988
Reasonably safe.

58:44.072 --> 58:46.281
Up here we've got hydrogen bombs
that your lab built

58:46.366 --> 58:47.324
leaking tritium,

58:47.409 --> 58:49.827
which I've spent the last six months
trying to clean up.

58:49.911 --> 58:52.204
So if you need any protection at all,
it's from me.

58:55.417 --> 58:56.917
Your friends are waiting for you.

59:03.091 --> 59:04.091
Doctor?

59:06.636 --> 59:08.095
Aren't you forgetting?

59:11.433 --> 59:13.142
Yes, of course. Thank you.

59:13.935 --> 59:15.269
By the way...

01:00:34.557 --> 01:00:39.186
Expecting Davidov?
He caught a bullet instead of the plane.

01:00:39.687 --> 01:00:43.190
Get off. Keep your mouth shut.

01:00:43.274 --> 01:00:45.192
You can't kill me, I'm already dead.

01:00:45.276 --> 01:00:48.445
Yeah, not dead enough for me.

01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:53.617
You could show a little gratitude,
I did spare your life at the banker's office.

01:00:54.202 --> 01:00:58.705
That's right. I couldn't kill you.
You were working for me.

01:00:59.165 --> 01:01:03.043
You delivered the money, killed King,
and now you brought me the plane.

01:01:03.711 --> 01:01:07.089
- What's your plan for the bomb?
- You first.

01:01:07.382 --> 01:01:11.802
- Or could it be you don't have a plan?
- That bomb will never leave this room.

01:01:13.096 --> 01:01:14.471
Neither will you.

01:01:20.186 --> 01:01:24.731
How sad to be threatened by a man
who can't grasp what he's involved in.

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:28.527
Revenge is not hard to fathom
for a man who believes in nothing.

01:01:28.611 --> 01:01:32.030
And what do you believe in?
Preservation of capital?

01:01:32.115 --> 01:01:35.450
Go ahead, shoot me. I'll welcome it.

01:01:35.827 --> 01:01:38.453
My men will hear the shot and kill you.

01:01:38.538 --> 01:01:41.456
And the firefight will bring down
half the army from above.

01:01:41.749 --> 01:01:45.085
But when a certain phone call
isn't made in 20 minutes,

01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:46.461
Elektra dies.

01:01:49.090 --> 01:01:53.010
- You're bluffing.
- She's beautiful, isn't she?

01:01:53.678 --> 01:01:57.556
You should have had her before,
when she was innocent.

01:01:58.308 --> 01:02:02.269
How does it feel
to know I broke her in for you?

01:02:04.314 --> 01:02:06.815
I usually hate killing an unarmed man.

01:02:07.025 --> 01:02:08.901
Cold-blooded murder is a filthy business.

01:02:08.985 --> 01:02:11.320
A man tires of being executed.

01:02:12.405 --> 01:02:16.033
But in your case, I feel nothing,
just like you.

01:02:16.242 --> 01:02:19.953
But then again, there's no point living
if you can't feel alive.

01:02:23.541 --> 01:02:24.541
Hey!

01:02:25.293 --> 01:02:27.461
- Drop the gun!
- Keep away, Colonel.

01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:30.547
He's an impostor.
Dr. Arkov is 63 years old.

01:02:30.632 --> 01:02:34.426
This is your impostor,
along with the men outside on the plane.

01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:36.303
They're stealing the bomb.

01:02:38.139 --> 01:02:39.723
I said drop it!

01:02:50.610 --> 01:02:51.693
On your knees!

01:02:55.073 --> 01:02:56.198
Well done.

01:02:58.159 --> 01:03:01.828
He would've killed us all.
Did you speak to him?

01:03:01.913 --> 01:03:04.498
Yeah, but he's no atomic scientist.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.502
I suppose you were the one
who allowed him down.

01:03:17.887 --> 01:03:18.971
You had me,

01:03:20.556 --> 01:03:24.518
but I knew you couldn't
shoulder the responsibility.

01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:33.193
Now, without any further interruptions,
let's proceed.

01:03:33.569 --> 01:03:36.113
There are too many new faces
around here,

01:03:36.197 --> 01:03:38.365
including yours.

01:03:38.449 --> 01:03:41.702
The bomb doesn't move
until I am satisfied.

01:03:42.161 --> 01:03:45.038
Hey, all of you, to the surface, now.

01:04:07.228 --> 01:04:08.312
Come on! Go!

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:12.065
Move!

01:04:19.073 --> 01:04:20.407
They're sealing us in.

01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:24.077
Who are you?

01:04:25.204 --> 01:04:27.080
I work for the British government.

01:04:32.045 --> 01:04:33.170
Stay calm.

01:06:36.878 --> 01:06:40.422
No hard feelings, Mr. Bond,
but we're even.

01:06:40.882 --> 01:06:44.009
Soon, you'll feel nothing at all.

01:07:10.411 --> 01:07:13.121
Seal the door! Close it!

01:07:25.551 --> 01:07:26.801
Come on!

01:07:47.782 --> 01:07:49.908
Keep going! Move! Hang on!

01:07:50.660 --> 01:07:52.869
So, you're a British spy.
Do you have a name?

01:07:52.954 --> 01:07:54.120
The name's Bond.

01:07:59.502 --> 01:08:00.794
James Bond.

01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:13.306
Don't stop! Go, go! Jump!

01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:35.996
They won't get very far.

01:08:36.162 --> 01:08:39.499
Every warhead has a locator card.
We can track the signal.

01:08:41.335 --> 01:08:43.002
You mean one of these?

01:08:50.678 --> 01:08:52.804
Do we have the range of Renard's plane?

01:08:53.014 --> 01:08:54.680
Anywhere in this circle.

01:08:54.765 --> 01:08:58.435
Russia, Armenia, Iran,
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan...

01:08:58.519 --> 01:09:01.145
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Elektra King is calling from Baku.

01:09:01.229 --> 01:09:04.232
- It's on the video line.
- Put her on the wall screen.

01:09:08.946 --> 01:09:13.617
I'm sorry. I would never call you,
except James has disappeared.

01:09:14.410 --> 01:09:16.493
He left my villa in the middle of the night,

01:09:16.578 --> 01:09:22.292
and my head of security has been found

01:09:22.376 --> 01:09:25.127
near your local airstrip, murdered.

01:09:26.087 --> 01:09:29.381
- I'll send someone out.
- M, could you come?

01:09:30.843 --> 01:09:34.554
I can't help thinking I'm next.

01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:40.268
- Get me out there.
- No, listen...

01:09:40.353 --> 01:09:42.645
Just get me out there.

01:10:00.998 --> 01:10:02.123
Gabor?

01:10:10.424 --> 01:10:11.424
James?

01:10:13.969 --> 01:10:15.178
Surprised?

01:10:15.638 --> 01:10:17.764
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?

01:10:17.848 --> 01:10:20.767
Maybe. Maybe I should ask you.

01:10:21.769 --> 01:10:26.022
After all, "there's no point in living
if you can't feel alive."

01:10:26.107 --> 01:10:28.775
Isn't that right, Elektra?
Isnâ€™t that your motto?

01:10:28.943 --> 01:10:29.984
What are you talking about?

01:10:30.069 --> 01:10:31.194
Or did you steal it

01:10:31.278 --> 01:10:33.321
- from your old friend Renard?
- What?

01:10:33.406 --> 01:10:34.906
He and I had a chat this morning.

01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:37.325
Knew all about us.
Knew about my shoulder.

01:10:37.410 --> 01:10:38.952
Knew exactly where to hurt me.

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:41.663
Are you saying Renard is the man
who's trying to kill me?

01:10:41.747 --> 01:10:42.831
Drop the act.

01:10:44.291 --> 01:10:45.291
It's over.

01:10:46.877 --> 01:10:49.879
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I think you do.

01:10:52.133 --> 01:10:54.217
It's called Stockholm syndrome,

01:10:55.386 --> 01:10:57.262
common in kidnappings.

01:10:57.763 --> 01:11:01.725
Young, impressionable victim. Sheltered.

01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:05.812
Sexually inexperienced.

01:11:06.313 --> 01:11:10.150
A powerful kidnapper
skilled in torture, manipulation.

01:11:11.527 --> 01:11:13.862
Something snaps in the victim's mind.

01:11:14.739 --> 01:11:16.614
The captive falls in love with her captor.

01:11:16.991 --> 01:11:18.199
How dare you?

01:11:19.201 --> 01:11:22.162
How dare you?
That animal? That monster?

01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:24.664
He disgusts me.

01:11:25.708 --> 01:11:27.417
You disgust me.

01:11:28.335 --> 01:11:31.212
So he knew where to hurt you, is that it?

01:11:31.464 --> 01:11:33.840
You had a sling on your arm
at the funeral.

01:11:34.341 --> 01:11:37.135
And I didn't have to sleep with you
to find that out.

01:11:37.344 --> 01:11:40.180
- He used your exact words.
- So you knew.

01:11:40.848 --> 01:11:42.265
You knew all the time
that he was out there,

01:11:42.349 --> 01:11:43.933
that he was coming for me,

01:11:44.018 --> 01:11:45.226
and you lied.

01:11:46.061 --> 01:11:47.520
You used me.

01:11:48.147 --> 01:11:50.023
You used me as bait.

01:11:53.527 --> 01:11:55.236
And you made love to me.

01:11:57.156 --> 01:11:58.364
What?

01:11:59.033 --> 01:12:02.368
To pass the time
as you waited for him to strike?

01:12:08.459 --> 01:12:09.459
Hello?

01:12:14.882 --> 01:12:18.259
He's struck again.
Ten men are dead at the pipeline.

01:12:18.427 --> 01:12:19.719
I'm coming with you.

01:12:20.888 --> 01:12:23.598
You do what you want to do,
but I've called M.

01:12:24.809 --> 01:12:26.851
She's coming to take charge.

01:12:41.367 --> 01:12:42.659
Oh, no.

01:12:56.590 --> 01:12:59.008
I want an update. Where do we stand?

01:12:59.927 --> 01:13:03.096
One of Renard's men removed
the locator card from the bomb

01:13:03.264 --> 01:13:04.764
so we can't track it. But...

01:13:04.932 --> 01:13:06.182
But what?

01:13:06.851 --> 01:13:08.226
With all due respect,

01:13:09.103 --> 01:13:10.937
I don't think you should be here.

01:13:12.106 --> 01:13:15.441
May I remind you
that you're the reason I'm here, 007.

01:13:15.776 --> 01:13:18.319
You disobeyed a direct order
and left that girl alone.

01:13:18.404 --> 01:13:21.406
Perhaps that girl isn't as innocent
as you think.

01:13:21.490 --> 01:13:24.158
- What are you saying?
- Suppose the inside man,

01:13:24.368 --> 01:13:28.997
the one who switched King's lapel pin,
turned out to be an inside woman?

01:13:31.876 --> 01:13:34.502
She kills her father
and attacks her own pipeline?

01:13:34.587 --> 01:13:36.963
- Why? To what end?
- I don't know, yet.

01:13:43.304 --> 01:13:45.221
Rig Station 11- RS

01:13:45.306 --> 01:13:47.724
Look at that. That's not right.

01:13:48.851 --> 01:13:51.895
- What is it?
- An observation rig.

01:13:52.104 --> 01:13:55.690
- Travels in the pipe looking for cracks.
- Shut it down.

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:01.070
I don't understand. It won't respond.

01:14:01.488 --> 01:14:03.406
The place is clean. No sign of the bomb.

01:14:03.490 --> 01:14:06.075
- The bomb is in the pipeline.
- Oh, my God!

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:08.995
They must have brought it through here.
That would explain the attack.

01:14:09.163 --> 01:14:10.538
Heading for the oil terminal.

01:14:10.623 --> 01:14:12.498
Where it would do the most damage.

01:14:12.583 --> 01:14:14.584
Have your men evacuate that terminal.

01:14:16.837 --> 01:14:18.504
So now do you believe me?

01:14:20.966 --> 01:14:23.760
This is an emergency situation.
So, please,

01:14:23.844 --> 01:14:25.678
clear the room. Do it.

01:14:25.846 --> 01:14:27.555
- He's going for the oil.
- Of course.

01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:29.974
The one pipeline the West is counting on

01:14:30.059 --> 01:14:33.186
to supply our reserves
for the next century.

01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:35.855
- Do you have an idea?
- Maybe.

01:14:36.857 --> 01:14:39.943
How far is that rig from the terminal?
And how fast is it traveling?

01:14:40.527 --> 01:14:44.948
It's 106 miles from the terminal,
going 70 miles an hour.

01:14:45.199 --> 01:14:47.283
We've got 78 minutes.
Do you have another rig?

01:14:47.368 --> 01:14:50.078
There's one parked in the passageway
ahead of it.

01:14:50.371 --> 01:14:53.081
- Charles, can you get me out there?
- Of course.

01:14:54.208 --> 01:14:55.291
Wait a minute.

01:14:55.376 --> 01:14:57.085
Are you gonna do
what I think you're gonna do?

01:14:57.169 --> 01:15:00.380
- What do I need to defuse a nuclear bomb?
- Me.

01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:15.937
There it is. Hatch to the passageway.

01:15:20.818 --> 01:15:21.859
Take the controls.

01:15:21.944 --> 01:15:24.112
You keep the speed up
so the other rig catches up with us.

01:15:24.196 --> 01:15:26.406
- I'll be waiting to hear from you.
- Gotcha.

01:15:27.116 --> 01:15:28.741
You know how to drive
one of these things?

01:15:28.909 --> 01:15:32.036
Doesn't exactly take a degree
in nuclear physics.

01:15:40.421 --> 01:15:43.506
They're in the pipeline.
They're on the move.

01:16:00.274 --> 01:16:01.441
Faster!

01:16:09.324 --> 01:16:12.285
If there's even the slightest chance,
Bond will succeed.

01:16:12.453 --> 01:16:16.164
He's the best we have,
though I'd never tell him.

01:16:17.708 --> 01:16:19.208
I hope you're right.

01:16:22.921 --> 01:16:24.255
Here it comes!

01:16:28.552 --> 01:16:30.720
It's closing up. Faster!

01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:37.810
Sit tight.

01:16:53.327 --> 01:16:55.328
No brakes! The controls are jammed!

01:17:09.802 --> 01:17:13.679
It's a tactical fission device, low yield.
Hold me steady.

01:17:14.598 --> 01:17:16.557
You've defused hundreds of these, right?

01:17:16.767 --> 01:17:19.018
Yeah, but they're usually standing still.

01:17:19.103 --> 01:17:22.063
Yeah, well, life's full of small challenges.

01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:27.318
Have a look at this.
Someone stripped the screw heads.

01:17:28.862 --> 01:17:30.655
Someone's tampered with the bomb.

01:17:51.051 --> 01:17:53.719
Look, half the plutonium's missing.

01:17:54.596 --> 01:17:57.265
So what are you saying?
It couldn't go nuclear?

01:17:57.349 --> 01:17:59.934
There's still enough explosive in there
to kill both of us

01:18:00.018 --> 01:18:01.519
if the trigger charge goes off.

01:18:01.603 --> 01:18:03.437
- Let it blow.
- But I can stop it.

01:18:03.522 --> 01:18:04.564
Let it blow!

01:18:10.737 --> 01:18:12.029
Trust me! Leave it!

01:18:15.993 --> 01:18:17.743
Move down. Move down!

01:18:17.953 --> 01:18:19.412
Jump! Go on, jump!

01:18:22.416 --> 01:18:23.583
Jump!

01:18:38.098 --> 01:18:39.765
Robinson's reporting.

01:18:40.267 --> 01:18:42.268
The bomb was a dud.

01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:46.689
But the triggering charge blew out
a 50-yard section of the pipe.

01:18:46.899 --> 01:18:47.982
And Bond?

01:18:49.067 --> 01:18:50.067
Nothing.

01:18:51.904 --> 01:18:53.446
I'm so sorry.

01:18:56.325 --> 01:18:58.075
But I have a gift for you.

01:18:58.869 --> 01:19:03.331
Something that belonged to my father.
He would've wanted you to have it.

01:19:04.458 --> 01:19:07.710
- Perhaps this isn't the time.
- Please.

01:19:09.213 --> 01:19:13.299
He often spoke of how compassionately
you advised him

01:19:13.383 --> 01:19:16.677
on the best course of action
during my kidnapping.

01:19:20.641 --> 01:19:22.308
It's very valuable, you know.

01:19:23.143 --> 01:19:25.978
I just couldn't let it explode
with the rest of him.

01:19:31.026 --> 01:19:34.237
I was very upset when the money
didn't kill both of you.

01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:37.365
I didn't think I'd get another chance.

01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:41.452
Then you dropped the answer
right in my lap.

01:19:41.954 --> 01:19:46.415
Bond. And as you say,
he's the best you have.

01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:48.501
Or should I say, "had"?

01:19:55.008 --> 01:19:56.550
Take her to the helicopter.

01:20:03.433 --> 01:20:05.810
Come on, give me your hand.
Jump, jump, jump!

01:20:07.646 --> 01:20:09.563
Do you wanna explain why you did that?

01:20:09.690 --> 01:20:12.191
I could've stopped that bomb.
You almost killed us.

01:20:12.526 --> 01:20:13.901
I did kill us.

01:20:14.528 --> 01:20:17.863
She thinks we're dead,
and she thinks she got away with it.

01:20:18.031 --> 01:20:21.492
Do you wanna put that in English for
those of us who don't speak "spy"?

01:20:21.702 --> 01:20:24.161
- Who's "she"?
- Elektra King.

01:20:24.371 --> 01:20:26.622
Well, why would she blow up
her own pipeline?

01:20:26.707 --> 01:20:28.207
It makes her look innocent.

01:20:30.043 --> 01:20:32.628
The explosion covers up
the theft of the plutonium.

01:20:34.548 --> 01:20:36.299
And they make it look
like a terrorist attack.

01:20:36.383 --> 01:20:38.634
But why leave this half?

01:20:39.011 --> 01:20:42.638
So there's enough to spread around
to cover up for the part that they did take.

01:20:42.764 --> 01:20:44.807
But what are they gonna do
with the other half?

01:20:45.058 --> 01:20:47.518
It's not enough to make a nuclear bomb.

01:20:47.728 --> 01:20:50.479
- You're the scientist, you tell me.
- I don't know.

01:20:51.606 --> 01:20:54.233
But the world's greatest terrorist
running around with six kilos

01:20:54.318 --> 01:20:56.610
of weapons-grade plutonium
can't be good.

01:20:56.903 --> 01:20:59.405
I have to get it back,
or somebody's gonna have my ass.

01:21:02.242 --> 01:21:03.617
First things first.

01:21:05.871 --> 01:21:07.788
Bond to Robinson. Do you copy?

01:21:07.956 --> 01:21:12.293
By the way, before we go any further,
I just wanna know,

01:21:13.587 --> 01:21:18.883
- what's the story with you and Elektra?
- We're strictly platonic. Now.

01:21:19.092 --> 01:21:20.968
Bond to Robinson. Copy?

01:21:23.638 --> 01:21:27.683
What's your story?
What are you doing here in Kazakhstan?

01:21:27.976 --> 01:21:31.062
Avoiding those kind of questions,
just like you.

01:21:31.605 --> 01:21:34.190
I read you, 007. Red alert.

01:21:34.399 --> 01:21:36.525
M is missing with Elektra.
Three men down.

01:21:36.735 --> 01:21:38.611
Await instructions. Out.

01:21:40.155 --> 01:21:41.155
What do we do now?

01:21:45.786 --> 01:21:48.162
There's one critical element here
I may have overlooked.

01:21:48.413 --> 01:21:50.331
- What? More plutonium?
- No.

01:21:51.124 --> 01:21:52.917
Beluga.

01:21:53.001 --> 01:21:54.251
Caviar.

01:22:24.032 --> 01:22:25.408
Brought me something?

01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:33.833
The power to reshape the world.

01:22:37.254 --> 01:22:40.131
Go on. It's safe.

01:22:41.466 --> 01:22:42.716
Touch your destiny.

01:22:56.731 --> 01:22:59.316
I have brought something for you, as well.

01:23:05.782 --> 01:23:10.119
Your present,
courtesy of the late Mr. Bond.

01:23:11.079 --> 01:23:14.206
- My executioner.
- Overpraise, I'm afraid.

01:23:15.083 --> 01:23:18.002
- But my people will finish the job.
- Your people?

01:23:18.545 --> 01:23:23.883
Your people will leave you here to rot
just like you left me.

01:23:24.885 --> 01:23:26.177
You and my father.

01:23:26.386 --> 01:23:28.429
- Your father wasn't...
- My father was nothing.

01:23:29.055 --> 01:23:31.557
His kingdom, he stole from my mother.

01:23:32.642 --> 01:23:35.394
The kingdom I will rightly take back.

01:23:44.362 --> 01:23:46.822
I hope you're proud
of what you did to her.

01:23:48.158 --> 01:23:50.618
I'm afraid it is you who deserve credit.

01:23:52.204 --> 01:23:55.956
When I took her, she was promise itself,

01:23:56.917 --> 01:23:59.502
and you left her at the mercy
of a man like me.

01:24:00.670 --> 01:24:02.296
You ruined her.

01:24:03.006 --> 01:24:05.341
For what? To get to me?

01:24:06.259 --> 01:24:09.261
- She's worth 50 of me.
- For once, I agree with you.

01:24:11.598 --> 01:24:15.935
Yes. And now we also share
a common fate.

01:24:17.103 --> 01:24:20.397
You will die,
along with everyone in this city

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:26.445
and the bright, starry, oil-driven
future of the West.

01:24:32.953 --> 01:24:37.873
Since you sent your man to kill me,
I've been watching time tick slowly away,

01:24:38.959 --> 01:24:40.751
marching toward my own death.

01:24:44.714 --> 01:24:46.632
Now you can have the same pleasure.

01:24:51.012 --> 01:24:52.763
Watch these hands, M.

01:24:53.807 --> 01:24:57.476
By noon tomorrow, your time is up.

01:24:59.062 --> 01:25:02.648
And I guarantee you, I will not miss.

01:25:25.589 --> 01:25:27.131
So beautiful.

01:25:28.717 --> 01:25:30.134
So smooth.

01:25:31.511 --> 01:25:32.970
So warm.

01:25:33.888 --> 01:25:35.472
How would you know?

01:25:40.812 --> 01:25:45.024
Why are you like this?
Because Bond is dead?

01:25:46.693 --> 01:25:50.946
- It's what you wanted.
- Of course it's what I wanted.

01:25:56.536 --> 01:25:57.703
He was...

01:26:00.999 --> 01:26:02.291
He was a good lover?

01:26:03.168 --> 01:26:06.211
What do you think?
I wouldn't feel anything?

01:26:21.394 --> 01:26:22.895
I feel nothing.

01:26:38.912 --> 01:26:40.245
What about this?

01:26:51.424 --> 01:26:56.720
But surely, you can feel this?

01:27:03.937 --> 01:27:09.066
Remember pleasure?

01:27:56.740 --> 01:27:57.823
Wait here.

01:27:58.825 --> 01:28:02.995
Always something.
First the casino, now the caviar factory.

01:28:03.663 --> 01:28:06.290
I am a slave to the free-market economy.

01:28:19.804 --> 01:28:20.804
Hello?

01:28:22.974 --> 01:28:24.475
Bond is alive.

01:28:29.689 --> 01:28:31.982
Is nothing in this place straight?

01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:40.240
Who are you? And how did you get in?

01:28:40.867 --> 01:28:44.495
I'll call security and congratulate them.

01:28:45.413 --> 01:28:46.705
Drink?

01:28:49.709 --> 01:28:52.294
Can't you just say hello
like a normal person?

01:28:53.963 --> 01:28:55.297
Get lost.

01:28:56.049 --> 01:28:58.675
No, no, no. Down the back.

01:29:01.054 --> 01:29:02.721
What's your business with Elektra King?

01:29:03.723 --> 01:29:07.184
I thought you were the one
giving her the business.

01:29:07.268 --> 01:29:10.687
She drops $1 million in your casino,
and you don't even blink an eye.

01:29:10.897 --> 01:29:12.731
What's she paying you off for?

01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:17.402
You know, if I were you,
a relationship with a man like that,

01:29:17.529 --> 01:29:18.779
I wouldn't bet on it.

01:29:23.243 --> 01:29:25.494
$5000 of beluga ruined.

01:29:25.578 --> 01:29:28.705
That's nothing compared to what a
20-megaton nuclear bomb can do.

01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:29.832
What are you talking about?

01:29:29.916 --> 01:29:32.084
We had a nuclear bomb
stolen this morning.

01:29:32.168 --> 01:29:34.503
Renard and Elektra King
are working together.

01:29:34.629 --> 01:29:36.380
- I didn't know.
- Well, what do you know?

01:32:00.566 --> 01:32:02.192
Q's not gonna like this.

01:33:19.771 --> 01:33:21.646
Hide!

01:33:32.450 --> 01:33:33.533
Get out!

01:34:45.148 --> 01:34:46.189
Help!

01:34:46.274 --> 01:34:48.650
Now, where were we?

01:34:48.734 --> 01:34:51.528
- A rope, please!
- No. The truth.

01:34:51.612 --> 01:34:52.696
She has M.

01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:55.574
- I know nothing about that.
- Those blades were meant for you.

01:34:55.658 --> 01:34:58.034
What does Elektra King
want you dead for?

01:34:58.786 --> 01:35:03.165
It was you who destroyed my factory,
then you drown my Rolls-Royce,

01:35:03.249 --> 01:35:06.751
and now you're trying to drown me
in my own caviar!

01:35:07.086 --> 01:35:08.461
Let me out!

01:35:08.921 --> 01:35:11.798
Too bad we don't have any champagne.

01:35:11.883 --> 01:35:13.133
Or sour cream.

01:35:13.676 --> 01:35:14.676
Okay, okay.

01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:22.475
Occasionally, I get equipment for her.
Machinery. You know, Russian stuff.

01:35:22.602 --> 01:35:24.311
And the payoff in the casino?

01:35:24.812 --> 01:35:26.062
It was a special job.

01:35:26.856 --> 01:35:28.607
My nephew is in the navy.

01:35:29.984 --> 01:35:33.195
He's smuggling some machinery for her.

01:35:33.404 --> 01:35:35.113
- Where?
- Absolutely not!

01:35:35.198 --> 01:35:36.239
Where?

01:35:39.827 --> 01:35:42.412
- Where?
- Istanbul!

01:35:51.797 --> 01:35:55.175
You! Where have you been,
you gold-encrusted buffoon?

01:35:55.259 --> 01:35:57.969
Sorry, boss. I must have bumped my head.

01:35:58.137 --> 01:35:59.763
Oh, really? Get me out of here,

01:35:59.847 --> 01:36:02.224
I'll show you
what a bumped head feels like.

01:36:02.308 --> 01:36:06.561
Look. We have no roof,
but at least we have four good walls.

01:36:19.158 --> 01:36:23.119
The insurance company
is never going to believe this.

01:37:24.473 --> 01:37:27.559
This used to be
the KGB's Istanbul safe house.

01:37:27.643 --> 01:37:30.812
Now it's FSB. Federal Security Bureau.

01:37:31.022 --> 01:37:33.690
Same old friendly service
with a new name.

01:37:34.108 --> 01:37:36.151
- Did you raise Nikoli?
- Nothing.

01:37:36.235 --> 01:37:38.778
Try scanning the emergency frequencies.

01:37:40.531 --> 01:37:41.573
Tragedy.

01:37:42.033 --> 01:37:44.993
In the old days,
there were at least a hundred places

01:37:45.077 --> 01:37:47.162
where a submarine
could surface undetected.

01:37:47.246 --> 01:37:48.330
Submarine?

01:37:49.081 --> 01:37:51.041
What class is your nephew running?

01:37:53.044 --> 01:37:55.003
- Victor III, you call it.
- Nuclear.

01:37:55.087 --> 01:37:57.881
He's not loading cargo. They want the sub.
They want to use the reactor.

01:37:57.965 --> 01:37:59.007
That's it.

01:37:59.091 --> 01:38:02.010
Put weapons-grade plutonium
in that sub's reactor,

01:38:02.136 --> 01:38:04.512
instant catastrophic meltdown.

01:38:04.722 --> 01:38:06.765
Making it all look just like an accident.

01:38:07.725 --> 01:38:08.933
But why?

01:38:09.602 --> 01:38:15.106
Because the existing pipelines from
the Caspian Sea go to the north. Here.

01:38:15.608 --> 01:38:19.778
The oil is put onboard the tankers, shipped
across the Black Sea, down to Istanbul.

01:38:20.529 --> 01:38:25.784
The explosion would destroy Istanbul,
contaminating the Bosporus for decades.

01:38:26.952 --> 01:38:29.079
And there'd be only one way
to get the oil out.

01:38:29.288 --> 01:38:32.999
Yeah, down south to the Med.
The King pipeline.

01:38:33.417 --> 01:38:34.501
Elektra's pipeline.

01:38:35.002 --> 01:38:36.795
We must find Nikoli.

01:38:38.756 --> 01:38:40.131
Captain Nikoli?

01:38:42.259 --> 01:38:43.343
Sir.

01:38:44.261 --> 01:38:45.804
Ready to load your cargo.

01:38:46.013 --> 01:38:47.931
We have only a few hours
before we'll be missed.

01:38:48.015 --> 01:38:49.057
You came with a skeleton crew?

01:38:49.141 --> 01:38:51.142
- Yeah, that's all we can afford these days.
- Of course.

01:38:51.811 --> 01:38:54.145
Some brandy and refreshments
for your men.

01:38:56.148 --> 01:38:57.232
Thank you.

01:39:02.488 --> 01:39:03.655
Good morning.

01:39:08.285 --> 01:39:09.619
What's the time?

01:39:23.217 --> 01:39:25.176
It's time for you to die.

01:39:57.793 --> 01:39:59.210
I've got something

01:40:00.171 --> 01:40:01.921
on the emergency frequency.

01:40:02.131 --> 01:40:04.716
Two six-digit numbers cycled
every 15 seconds.

01:40:04.884 --> 01:40:08.845
- A GPS signal. Position coordinates.
- Locator card. M.

01:40:12.224 --> 01:40:14.142
- Here.
- Yeah. Maiden's Tower.

01:40:14.226 --> 01:40:16.895
- Have you been there?
- No. No. Mr. Bullion.

01:40:21.066 --> 01:40:22.192
Bomb!

01:40:29.074 --> 01:40:30.492
Come on, come on, come on.

01:40:44.256 --> 01:40:47.550
After you. I insist.

01:41:04.610 --> 01:41:06.528
Enjoyed your meal, boys?

01:41:14.411 --> 01:41:16.538
Take them up and throw them in the sea.

01:41:28.884 --> 01:41:30.468
The extruder's in here.

01:41:31.929 --> 01:41:35.890
It will take me half an hour to set up
the machine to make the plutonium rod.

01:41:42.731 --> 01:41:44.148
Put them in here.

01:41:53.701 --> 01:41:57.328
The reactor is secured.
Everything is complete as planned.

01:42:00.082 --> 01:42:03.835
- Is your helicopter ready?
- It's going to pick me up in half an hour.

01:42:07.339 --> 01:42:08.881
Then this is the end.

01:42:09.133 --> 01:42:11.926
No. This is the beginning.

01:42:13.554 --> 01:42:15.346
The world will never be the same.

01:42:29.028 --> 01:42:33.239
The future is yours. Have fun with it.

01:42:40.706 --> 01:42:42.123
James Bond.

01:42:50.633 --> 01:42:51.966
If only you'd kept away,

01:42:52.051 --> 01:42:55.470
we might have met again in a few years
and become lovers once more.

01:43:05.064 --> 01:43:06.564
Take her to Renard.

01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:12.737
Pretty thing. You had her, too?

01:43:18.035 --> 01:43:19.911
I could've given you the world.

01:43:21.372 --> 01:43:22.955
The world is not enough.

01:43:23.874 --> 01:43:26.918
- Foolish sentiment.
- Family motto.

01:43:30.214 --> 01:43:34.592
They were digging near here,
and they found some very pretty vases.

01:43:35.803 --> 01:43:37.970
They also found this chair.

01:43:48.649 --> 01:43:52.735
I think we ignore the old ways
at our peril, don't you?

01:43:53.737 --> 01:43:57.323
- Where's M?
- Soon, she'll be everywhere.

01:43:58.951 --> 01:44:03.454
All this because you fell for Renard?

01:44:06.750 --> 01:44:09.711
Five more turns and your neck will break.

01:44:13.173 --> 01:44:15.675
I've always had a power over men.

01:44:17.886 --> 01:44:22.223
When I realized my father wouldn't
rescue me from the kidnappers,

01:44:22.641 --> 01:44:25.309
I knew I had to form another alliance.

01:44:26.687 --> 01:44:30.148
You turned Renard.

01:44:31.692 --> 01:44:36.446
Just like you, only you were even easier.

01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:44.162
I told him he had to hurt me.
He had to make it look real.

01:44:45.456 --> 01:44:50.752
When he refused,
I told him I would do it myself.

01:44:55.215 --> 01:44:58.426
So you killed your father.

01:44:59.595 --> 01:45:00.845
He killed me.

01:45:02.556 --> 01:45:04.891
He killed me the day
he refused to pay my ransom.

01:45:05.184 --> 01:45:07.477
Was this all about the oil?

01:45:09.229 --> 01:45:11.022
It is my oil.

01:45:11.815 --> 01:45:14.358
Mine and my family's.

01:45:14.693 --> 01:45:17.862
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood.

01:45:19.031 --> 01:45:21.407
I'm going to redraw the map.

01:45:21.658 --> 01:45:24.952
And when I'm through,
the whole world will know my name,

01:45:25.162 --> 01:45:28.372
my grandfather's name,
the glory of my people!

01:45:28.457 --> 01:45:31.667
No one will believe this meltdown
was an accident.

01:45:32.169 --> 01:45:34.629
They will believe. They will all believe.

01:45:35.672 --> 01:45:39.300
You understand? Nobody can resist me.

01:45:44.264 --> 01:45:47.308
You know what happens
when a man is strangled?

01:45:47.392 --> 01:45:50.770
Elektra, it's not too late.

01:45:52.773 --> 01:45:55.566
Eight million people need not die.

01:45:57.402 --> 01:46:00.071
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

01:46:01.198 --> 01:46:04.367
But you couldn't. Not me.
Not a woman you've loved.

01:46:14.795 --> 01:46:17.296
You meant nothing to me.

01:46:22.761 --> 01:46:28.808
One last screw.

01:46:28.934 --> 01:46:30.601
Oh, James.

01:46:53.959 --> 01:46:58.462
Boss, you're alive. So glad to see you.

01:46:59.256 --> 01:47:00.381
Me too.

01:47:06.430 --> 01:47:08.014
I'm looking for a submarine.

01:47:08.098 --> 01:47:11.309
It's big and black, and the driver
is a very good friend of mine.

01:47:16.356 --> 01:47:18.316
Bring it to me.

01:47:19.610 --> 01:47:22.486
What a shame. He's just gone.

01:48:10.661 --> 01:48:12.745
Zukovsky really hated you.

01:48:14.498 --> 01:48:17.208
Everything's under control up here.
Are you ready?

01:48:24.341 --> 01:48:25.967
Time to say good night.

01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:58.499
James, you can't kill me,
not in cold blood.

01:49:05.298 --> 01:49:06.590
Bond!

01:49:28.113 --> 01:49:29.280
Call him off.

01:49:36.413 --> 01:49:37.955
I won't ask again.

01:49:39.291 --> 01:49:42.960
Call him off. Call him off!

01:49:47.674 --> 01:49:48.924
Renard.

01:49:53.722 --> 01:49:57.016
You wouldn't kill me. You'd miss me.

01:49:59.478 --> 01:50:00.478
Yes.

01:50:01.521 --> 01:50:03.439
Dive! Bond...

01:50:09.029 --> 01:50:10.362
I never miss.

01:51:18.598 --> 01:51:19.890
Where is she?

01:51:37.909 --> 01:51:38.909
James!

01:51:39.661 --> 01:51:41.871
Thought I'd forgotten you, eh?

01:52:14.112 --> 01:52:17.489
Level at 100 feet. Hold her steady.

01:52:28.293 --> 01:52:29.668
Level at 100 feet.

01:52:35.133 --> 01:52:39.595
If we can force them up to the surface,
they'll show up on the spy satellite,

01:52:39.971 --> 01:52:41.472
bring out the navy.

01:52:51.858 --> 01:52:53.317
Come on. Get up!

01:52:53.485 --> 01:52:55.194
Over there. Go! Move!

01:52:55.278 --> 01:52:56.487
Move! Go, go, go!

01:52:56.655 --> 01:53:00.115
Get over there! Stay! Up!

01:53:30.355 --> 01:53:32.815
Get us level! Level!

01:53:33.024 --> 01:53:34.650
It's all smashed!

01:53:34.859 --> 01:53:35.901
Christmas?

01:53:37.362 --> 01:53:41.115
- So we're going up, then?
- Slight miscalculation.

01:53:53.211 --> 01:53:54.295
Hold on!

01:53:56.423 --> 01:53:58.382
Hold on, hold on.

01:54:13.690 --> 01:54:15.065
Brace yourself.

01:54:44.346 --> 01:54:47.514
- It's flooding!
- Get up to the hatch.

01:54:55.482 --> 01:54:59.526
Damn! Come on! Go, go!

01:55:00.278 --> 01:55:03.447
Move! Go on! Get out, now!

01:55:24.344 --> 01:55:26.804
He's opened up the reactor!

01:55:26.888 --> 01:55:28.430
And locked himself in!

01:55:28.515 --> 01:55:30.391
I have to get up there to him.

01:55:31.142 --> 01:55:32.518
We've got one chance.

01:55:32.602 --> 01:55:37.189
I'll get out of the submarine and back in
through the reactor room escape hatch.

01:55:40.693 --> 01:55:44.655
When the light goes red,
press this button so I can get back in.

01:55:45.323 --> 01:55:46.907
James, it's too risky.

01:55:46.991 --> 01:55:49.827
If I don't make it,
use this chamber to get out.

01:55:49.911 --> 01:55:51.120
Close the hatch.

01:55:51.204 --> 01:55:53.455
Be sure to exhale all the way up. Close it.

01:58:22.772 --> 01:58:23.772
James!

01:58:26.150 --> 01:58:27.150
Help!

01:58:38.329 --> 01:58:39.580
Come on, come on!

01:58:42.792 --> 01:58:44.876
We're safe from the radiation

01:58:44.961 --> 01:58:47.796
as long as the reactor coolant
doesn't burst.

01:58:47.880 --> 01:58:50.591
If he had gotten the plutonium rod
in the reactor,

01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:53.176
we could've written off the whole city.

01:58:53.428 --> 01:58:54.428
James!

01:58:57.390 --> 01:58:59.349
Welcome to my nuclear family.

01:59:25.918 --> 01:59:28.337
Are you really gonna
commit suicide for her?

01:59:28.421 --> 01:59:30.881
You forget, I'm already dead.

01:59:31.257 --> 01:59:34.593
Haven't you heard? So is she.

01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:41.016
You're lying.

01:59:44.395 --> 01:59:45.562
Liar!

02:01:07.603 --> 02:01:08.979
She's waiting for you.

02:01:27.248 --> 02:01:32.252
The hydrogen gas level's too high.
One spark and the reactor will blow.

02:01:32.462 --> 02:01:34.045
I have to stop it.

02:01:37.717 --> 02:01:40.886
Go to the top of the submarine.
I'll meet you in the torpedo bay. Go!

02:01:46.768 --> 02:01:48.310
The reactor is flooded.

02:01:50.104 --> 02:01:52.773
So it's safe even if this place blows.

02:02:25.181 --> 02:02:26.181
Hey!

02:02:29.268 --> 02:02:30.268
Hey!

02:02:30.812 --> 02:02:32.938
- Hi!
- Hello!

02:02:36.984 --> 02:02:41.738
No, it's simply not the case.
No. Before that.

02:02:47.119 --> 02:02:49.830
- Any word?
- No. Still no contact.

02:02:54.919 --> 02:02:57.295
Always wanted to have Christmas
in Turkey.

02:02:59.841 --> 02:03:04.886
- Was that a Christmas joke?
- From me? No. Never.

02:03:05.930 --> 02:03:08.348
So isn't it time
you unwrapped your present?

02:03:08.432 --> 02:03:09.891
Oh, I think so.

02:03:14.730 --> 02:03:16.273
Look. What's that?

02:03:17.191 --> 02:03:18.817
- The card.
- So he must be nearby.

02:03:19.110 --> 02:03:20.193
Where?

02:03:23.281 --> 02:03:25.031
- Where?
- It picks up body heat,

02:03:25.116 --> 02:03:26.908
so humans come out orange.

02:03:29.203 --> 02:03:30.245
There.

02:03:33.374 --> 02:03:35.250
I thought you said he was with Dr. Jones?

02:03:40.965 --> 02:03:41.965
It's getting redder.

02:03:49.557 --> 02:03:50.765
007!

02:03:56.147 --> 02:03:59.274
Must be a premature form
of the millennium bug.

02:04:02.153 --> 02:04:03.695
I was wrong about you.

02:04:04.989 --> 02:04:06.740
Yeah? How so?

02:04:08.701 --> 02:04:11.701
I thought Christmas only comes
once a year.
