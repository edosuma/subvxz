We really had no idea of the things
that we would discover in the house.

00:23.548 --> 00:27.818
We had never seen anything that violent.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.620
[Whispering] Rebecca.

00:29.621 --> 00:31.988
It was like someone
were saying, I'm here.

00:31.989 --> 00:33.457
I'm here.

00:33.458 --> 00:34.958
I'm here.

her to not be there...

No, honey, come on.

01:16.434 --> 01:19.005
You know, this will
be a huge move for me.

01:19.006 --> 01:23.895
In 2005, I was given the opportunity
to interview for the deanship

01:23.896 --> 01:27.945
of the School of Arts and Humanities at
the University of Arkansas Monticello.

01:27.946 --> 01:29.546
Let me just hear them out.

01:29.547 --> 01:34.852
My wife, Rebecca, was wary
of moving away from Oklahoma.

01:34.853 --> 01:37.728
When Mark first started
applying for jobs,

01:37.729 --> 01:41.391
I told him I would move
anywhere but Alaska or Arkansas.

01:41.392 --> 01:44.227
And so he puts me in the
car to go to Arkansas.

01:44.228 --> 01:46.029
I'm a city girl.

01:46.030 --> 01:47.263

01:47.264 --> 01:50.329
Rebecca and I turned
down North Main Street,

01:50.330 --> 01:54.474
and immediately we were
impressed by these beautiful...

01:54.475 --> 01:58.375
Um, circa 1900 Victorian mansions.

02:00.512 --> 02:06.412
Well, we came to one in particular
that caused us to stop the car.

02:08.219 --> 02:11.254
It was love at first sight.

Wow.

[Chuckles]

02:15.827 --> 02:20.697
I just said, Mark, I will only move
to this town if you buy me that house.

02:20.698 --> 02:24.028
I knew that I would only be happy...

02:24.029 --> 02:26.857
In such an isolated location.

02:26.858 --> 02:31.598
If I had a home that
was everything to me.

We really were fulfilling our desires.

02:58.402 --> 03:00.336
Thanks. Let's go. Let's go.

03:00.337 --> 03:04.777
And now we had the house of our dreams.

03:05.309 --> 03:10.829
That wasn't the fairy-tale
image that I took from it.

03:11.667 --> 03:17.567
I didn't feel so much like a
Princess as I did a scared little kid.

03:21.092 --> 03:26.852
The house is enormous, and
you feel very vulnerable to it.

03:29.300 --> 03:33.860
I felt mesmerized. I
felt very spellbound.

03:33.863 --> 03:37.206
I just laid down on
the floor on my back...

03:37.207 --> 03:42.787
And just had that moment
for myself of, wow, I own it.

04:11.242 --> 04:12.843
- Yeah.
- There?

04:12.844 --> 04:14.745
Just rearrange them how you want, okay?

04:14.746 --> 04:19.683
A little after we had just moved in, we
had decided to sort of rearrange the house.

Out of the corner of my eye,
I caught the record spinning.

04:53.851 --> 04:59.751
And it was going faster and faster,
I mean, just as fast as it could go.

04:59.857 --> 05:01.858
I hadn't cranked the record player.

05:01.859 --> 05:05.279
Rebecca hadn't cranked it.

05:08.648 --> 05:14.548
There was no explanation for why the
record could possibly be spinning.

[Low grinding]

05:27.000 --> 05:28.800
Ah!

05:29.087 --> 05:31.621
It just stopped spinning instantly.

05:31.622 --> 05:35.025
That was very, very strange.

05:35.026 --> 05:38.446
It didn't make any sense.

05:39.765 --> 05:43.328
Seeing something like this really...

feeling about the house.

06:03.654 --> 06:06.982
One of the things that
the kids and I have

06:06.983 --> 06:10.537
always done for recreation
on the weekends is...

06:10.538 --> 06:12.898
To get out our metal detector...

06:12.899 --> 06:14.731
Okay. Hey, slow down, now.

06:14.732 --> 06:16.032
Slow down, Jake.

06:16.033 --> 06:21.004
And to go around, seeing whether we
could find anything in the ground.

06:21.005 --> 06:23.573
There could be some really neat
stuff here in this old yard.

06:23.574 --> 06:26.709
I was out by the front sidewalk.
I was listening to music...

the big old rose bushes...

[Metal detector beeping]

06:36.587 --> 06:39.790
Oh. Wait. Hey, over here.
Guys, found something. Come on.

06:39.791 --> 06:43.526
The metal detector started making
its high-pitched beeping sound.

06:43.527 --> 06:45.662
Over here. Go ahead, Josh.

06:45.663 --> 06:48.631
Get down there with

- Ooh, found something.
- Ooh, what is that?

06:58.329 --> 07:04.229
As we broke apart the soil, we
discovered an old penny from 1948.

07:05.783 --> 07:07.784
See if there's something else in there.

07:07.785 --> 07:08.785
Pull it out. What is it?

07:08.786 --> 07:12.155
And we found an old pillbox.

07:12.156 --> 07:15.358
Wow, this is something else.

07:15.359 --> 07:17.060
- Oh, look at that.
- This?

07:17.061 --> 07:19.569
Wow. What is that?

07:19.570 --> 07:23.590

07:27.090 --> 07:30.030
[Whispering] Rebecca.

07:30.441 --> 07:34.477
I heard someone, a woman's
voice, say, "Rebecca".

07:34.478 --> 07:37.916
I felt this strong sense
that someone was watching me,

07:37.917 --> 07:40.139
and I turned and looked up at the house.

07:40.140 --> 07:42.780
[Dramatic music]

07:46.090 --> 07:51.990
I thought I saw something in the
shape of a woman in the window.

[Feedback screeches]

07:59.503 --> 08:01.963
[Eerie music]

08:03.908 --> 08:08.648
I felt that the house
itself had its own...

08:08.980 --> 08:11.800
Presence, I guess.

08:21.692 --> 08:25.858
We had been in the house maybe a month,
and we decided to have a yard sale.

08:25.859 --> 08:31.067
And my friend Desi said she had some
things she wanted to get rid of too.

08:31.068 --> 08:33.249
I was just walking up the stairs.

08:33.250 --> 08:37.414
As I got closer and closer
to the house, and I looked up.

08:37.414 --> 08:41.975
And in the bedroom
window, I saw Rebecca.

08:45.249 --> 08:47.769
Hey, Destiney.

08:48.085 --> 08:50.671
There was no way that she could
have made it from upstairs in the

08:50.672 --> 08:53.957
bedroom to the door in, you know,
a matter of just a few seconds.

08:53.958 --> 08:55.892
I just saw you in the window.

08:55.893 --> 08:58.094
No, it's just me in the house right now.

08:58.095 --> 09:00.188
And I said, well, I wasn't upstairs.

09:00.189 --> 09:05.235
I've been at the back of the house,
pricing these items for the yard sale.

09:05.236 --> 09:10.816
There was no doubt in my
mind that I knew what I saw.

09:13.577 --> 09:17.914
I started taking my
boxes into the foyer.

09:17.915 --> 09:19.236
I saw Rebecca.

09:19.237 --> 09:21.983
Hey, Rebecca, I could use your
help getting some of that stuff.

09:21.984 --> 09:26.856
It's not a whole lot, but I could use some
help with some big boxes and everything.

09:26.857 --> 09:31.027
And then so I just walked out.
I expected her to follow me.

09:31.028 --> 09:35.546
She wasn't there, and I was like,
oh, I guess she maybe didn't hear me.

09:35.547 --> 09:38.127
[Ominous music]

09:40.237 --> 09:42.505
I walk back into the house
with my second load of boxes.

09:42.506 --> 09:44.274
Rebecca was still just standing there.

09:44.275 --> 09:45.708
Could use some help, please.

09:45.709 --> 09:47.914
I'm like, hey, did you not hear me?

09:47.915 --> 09:50.315
Rebecca? No?

09:51.082 --> 09:54.750
You know, I spoke to her, but
she never spoke back to me.

09:54.751 --> 09:59.311
And I was like, okay,
whatever, you know?

10:03.127 --> 10:04.987
Hey.

10:08.099 --> 10:10.766
Rebecca comes in from
the back of the house.

10:10.767 --> 10:13.603
I mean, I was so confused.

10:13.604 --> 10:14.971
Then I'm very upset.

10:14.972 --> 10:17.607
Rebecca, why have you been ignoring me?

10:17.608 --> 10:21.540
I was practically begging for you to
help me come get some of this stuff out.

10:21.541 --> 10:23.813
Desi, when did you ask me for help?

10:23.814 --> 10:26.983
I don't know who you're talking to.

10:26.984 --> 10:31.488
At this time, I was just like,
ugh, you know, what's going on?

10:31.489 --> 10:32.955
Destiney.

10:32.956 --> 10:36.226
I'm just wondering
if I'm losing my mind.

10:36.227 --> 10:38.294
- Here, let me help you.
- I believed her.

10:38.295 --> 10:44.195
I believed that she saw me somewhere
in the house and I wasn't really there.

_.

11:07.238 --> 11:10.358
Something odd occurred.

11:14.011 --> 11:19.051
There was a broken glass
on the kitchen counter.

11:19.751 --> 11:24.851
It wasn't on the floor.
It wasn't in the sink.

11:31.729 --> 11:35.732
I thought that maybe one of
the kids had broken the glass.

11:35.733 --> 11:39.002
Did any of you break a glass
this morning, last night?

11:39.003 --> 11:40.263
Both: No.

11:40.264 --> 11:43.790
But the kids said they
hadn't broken a glass.

11:43.791 --> 11:48.804
And I really didn't have any
reason not to believe them.

11:48.805 --> 11:54.705
The glass seemed to have broken
overnight when everybody was sleeping.

11:55.219 --> 11:59.467
And then every day that week
when I went down to the kitchen...

11:59.468 --> 12:03.092
There was a broken glass on the counter.

12:03.093 --> 12:08.993
It was strange that it kept
repeating itself, just every morning.

12:09.807 --> 12:12.602
But each day, it was the same thing.

12:43.133 --> 12:47.513
I did not dare look up into the attic.

I went back into my
bedroom and closed the door.

13:05.022 --> 13:07.662
[Faint clinking]

13:11.396 --> 13:16.016
I heard ice cubes
clinking against glass...

13:18.875 --> 13:21.408
As if someone were
walking down the hallway,

13:21.409 --> 13:23.807
and had just gotten a
drink from the kitchen.

13:23.808 --> 13:26.748
[Ice cubes rattling]

13:28.913 --> 13:33.383
There was no way that it was my
little brothers, my dad, or my stepmom.

13:33.384 --> 13:36.787
They were just across the
hall, asleep in their beds.

[Fan whirring]

in, as if someone were pushing them.

14:46.624 --> 14:49.324
I was terrified.

14:52.036 --> 14:53.896
I...

14:54.187 --> 14:59.887
I knew for a fact that there
was something in the house.

15:00.952 --> 15:05.217
Bronte didn't want to be in the house.

15:05.218 --> 15:08.680
So we decided to go on vacation.

15:08.681 --> 15:14.581
She told me on more than one occasion about
things that were happening in her room.

15:15.987 --> 15:21.591
I have to admit that I wasn't
terribly worried about it.

15:21.592 --> 15:24.060
You know, she's an
11-year-old girl,

15:24.061 --> 15:28.398

just her imagination working overtime.

We never leave the house alone.

So we invited one of
Mark's students, Reagan,

15:36.085 --> 15:40.376
to come and house-sit for us and
watch the animals while we were gone.

15:40.377 --> 15:44.036
The Spencers are a very lovely family,
and I had grown quite close to them.

house-sit for them that summer.

comfortable to come in the

house and stay in the
house as much as possible.

15:57.394 --> 16:01.854

anything that had happened in the house.

two walls around it?</i>

16:22.553 --> 16:28.417
Rebecca calls me, and she asked me if I
wouldn't mind going upstairs to the attic.

16:28.418 --> 16:31.962
To make sure that the roof wasn't leaking,
make sure the buckets weren't overflowing.

16:31.963 --> 16:33.997
Okay, yeah, sure.

16:33.998 --> 16:35.799
Okay, bye.

16:35.800 --> 16:38.668
So I thought to myself, I really
don't want to go up there...

16:38.669 --> 16:40.971
Sorry, Howdy.

16:40.972 --> 16:43.073
But I would do anything
for the Spencers.

[Thunder booming]

16:52.149 --> 16:54.609
[Eerie music]

17:11.002 --> 17:14.369
I grabbed a chair and propped
it up against the door.

17:14.371 --> 17:20.191
It helped to leave that door
open to get more illumination.

17:23.614 --> 17:26.314
[Water trickling]

17:34.224 --> 17:36.325
As I walked up the stairs, it was...

17:36.326 --> 17:41.606
I could hear that the rain
was hitting pretty hard.

17:43.333 --> 17:46.033
[Thunder booming]

17:58.315 --> 18:03.595
There were some buckets
that were about to overflow.

18:16.433 --> 18:20.513
I was too nervous to look too far.

18:20.659 --> 18:25.759
Because it was just a
spooky old Victorian attic.

18:32.616 --> 18:35.196
[Ominous music]

18:41.125 --> 18:43.105
Howdy.

18:43.828 --> 18:45.808
Howdy.

18:46.563 --> 18:49.203
Howdy, come on.

18:49.433 --> 18:51.953
Come on, boy.

18:52.069 --> 18:54.137
Howdy, where are you?

[Door slams]

18:56.173 --> 18:57.332
Ah!

me and the dog in total darkness.

19:30.257 --> 19:33.125
I just felt this
overwhelming sense of panic.

19:33.126 --> 19:35.993
I feel like I got to run down, you
know, try to get out of the attic,

19:35.994 --> 19:41.634
but at the same time, I've
still got this dog up here.

19:43.303 --> 19:45.283

20:25.712 --> 20:27.012
Come on, Mister.

20:27.013 --> 20:32.233
I grabbed the dog, and I
just ran for the stairs.

20:33.987 --> 20:37.784
I slipped over. I was terrified.

20:37.785 --> 20:42.645
I needed to get out of
the attic immediately.

20:49.045 --> 20:52.045
The chair had moved.

21:02.115 --> 21:05.117
And I see this person go into
the doorway of Mark's study.

As much as I wanted her to
not be there, she was there.

[Keys jingling]

22:03.810 --> 22:05.811
[Gasps]

22:05.812 --> 22:11.712
I threw the door open and then got
out of there as fast as I could.

22:16.789 --> 22:19.443
Reagan called me and said...

22:19.444 --> 22:23.962
That she had had a really weird,
strange experience in the house.

22:23.963 --> 22:27.381
Someone else in the house having
another strange experience...

22:27.382 --> 22:32.842
Makes you feel like maybe
it's not all in your head.

22:33.673 --> 22:36.709
With all the weird stuff
going on in the house...

22:36.710 --> 22:41.680
I decided to go and do historical
research about the original homeowners.

22:41.681 --> 22:43.282
They were such a wealthy family.

22:43.283 --> 22:44.410
Right.

22:44.411 --> 22:47.786
The Allens were a
particularly prominent family.

22:47.787 --> 22:51.796
Joe Lee Allen was the
President of a bank.

22:51.797 --> 22:55.527
And they had three daughters...
Lonnie, Ladell, and Lewie...

22:55.528 --> 22:58.497
And he really built the house for them.

22:58.498 --> 23:01.494
And this is the picture of Ladell.

23:01.495 --> 23:04.063
Ladell was the middle daughter.

23:04.064 --> 23:09.569
Ladell quickly emerged as a particularly
interesting figure in the Allen family.

23:09.570 --> 23:13.290
Ladell's name kept popping up.

23:13.373 --> 23:17.298
Ladell was a woman who had a
lot of heartache, a lot of...

23:17.299 --> 23:20.547
A lot of tragedy sort
of surrounding her life.

23:20.548 --> 23:22.924
Her dad died when she was little.

23:22.925 --> 23:25.559
She found herself in a bad marriage.

23:25.560 --> 23:27.714
She got divorced in 1927.

23:27.715 --> 23:29.315
Look at this here.

23:29.316 --> 23:34.776
And then her only child
died of pneumonia in his 20s.

23:35.689 --> 23:40.226
And then we discovered that
Ladell had died in the house.

23:40.227 --> 23:42.729
She died relatively young.

23:42.730 --> 23:46.658
There was the mystery
as to why she had died.

23:46.659 --> 23:50.979
Because it seemed that nobody knew why.

23:51.535 --> 23:56.976
So I decided to go ahead and
order her death certificate.

23:56.977 --> 23:59.644
With all the strange, unusual
things that were happening,

23:59.645 --> 24:04.745
I wanted to see if I
could link them to Ladell.

24:09.523 --> 24:10.909
We were both skeptics...

24:10.910 --> 24:12.024
- Morning.
- Hey.

24:12.025 --> 24:17.132
But I was beginning to embrace the idea
that there might be something more to it.

24:17.133 --> 24:19.164
Than we knew or we could explain.

24:19.165 --> 24:21.967
I'm beginning to wonder
about these things.

24:21.968 --> 24:27.640
And she actually broached the subject
of bringing in paranormal investigators.

24:27.641 --> 24:33.541
And I was a little flabbergasted
that she even mentioned this.

24:34.147 --> 24:36.883
I felt that I had a professional
reputation to protect.

24:36.884 --> 24:41.353
I was The Dean of the largest
school at a university.

24:41.354 --> 24:44.897
Rebecca, there's nothing
going on in this house.

24:44.898 --> 24:50.718
I mean, I was all about rational
explanations of everything.

24:53.333 --> 24:55.373
[Sighs]

24:56.870 --> 25:01.850
You can never underestimate
the power of denial.

25:02.509 --> 25:03.518
Okay.

25:03.519 --> 25:06.683
I didn't want them to come in and tell
me that what I was seeing was real.

25:06.684 --> 25:12.084
I wanted them to come in
and say it wasn't haunted.

25:15.589 --> 25:17.859
A lot of people we work with

25:17.860 --> 25:21.494
kind of want to prove their house is
haunted, but Mark and Rebecca did not.

25:21.495 --> 25:23.729
They didn't want this
stuff to be going on.

25:23.730 --> 25:25.950
Ooh. Wow.

25:27.734 --> 25:30.670
We take a great deal
of equipment with us.

25:30.671 --> 25:36.175
Digital tape recorders, electromagnetic
field meters, infrared cameras.

25:36.176 --> 25:37.610
Up in the corner there. One there.

25:37.611 --> 25:41.871
And we run those cameras in the dark.

25:46.319 --> 25:50.155
We sent the children to
friends' houses for the night.

25:50.156 --> 25:53.697
We decided that we were just
sort of in the way, and I said...

25:53.698 --> 25:58.030
We're gonna go see a movie,
and they said, that's great.

25:58.031 --> 26:01.011
I honestly didn't expect them

26:01.012 --> 26:04.704
to find any evidence whatsoever
of paranormal activity.

26:04.705 --> 26:07.006
Bye. The house is all yours.

26:07.007 --> 26:09.287

26:24.491 --> 26:28.192
We get ready to turn all the lights
out, because these are infrared cameras.

26:28.193 --> 26:30.530
And they see better in the dark.

26:30.531 --> 26:32.131
I said, has everybody got their stuff?

distinct odor of cigar smoke.

26:57.090 --> 26:59.625
- Peter?
- Yeah.

26:59.626 --> 27:05.230
And we actually smelled the furniture to
see if the cigar smoke was in the fabric.

27:05.231 --> 27:07.754
Couldn't really smell anything.

27:07.755 --> 27:11.415

sound in the backyard.

out the door to find out what's going on.

Oh, my God.

right, we're coming back.

28:38.282 --> 28:40.802
What happened?

28:43.438 --> 28:46.432
There was this huge tree limb...

of the power line out
of the transformer...

from a completely healthy tree.

- I know.

29:01.171 --> 29:03.038

29:03.039 --> 29:05.408
It hadn't been cut or sawn.

see a tree limb pulled off in a storm...

I started to think...

29:21.378 --> 29:25.398
Well, maybe there's something here.

29:26.797 --> 29:32.697
Something in that house made that
happen to stop that investigation.

29:33.704 --> 29:38.084
We had never seen anything that violent.

takes an awful lot of power and energy.

I knew absolutely that
there was a man in the attic.

30:45.910 --> 30:49.111
I'm in my office, I pick up
the phone, and Rebecca says...

30:49.112 --> 30:51.047
[Whispering] There's a man in the attic.

30:51.048 --> 30:54.484

somebody in the attic? Who's in the attic?

I heard footsteps. Please come home.

was maybe a squirrel.

because Rebecca seems so convinced.

31:10.575 --> 31:11.821
Quick. Hurry.

I thought that if I could possibly
lock the person in the attic,

31:41.618 --> 31:44.548
that they would still be
there when Mark got back.

31:44.549 --> 31:47.336

have gotten out of the

32:25.943 --> 32:27.835
I wasn't used to seeing her like that,

strong, secure woman.

34:27.481 --> 34:32.418
I'm just thinking, I know no one in the
house smokes anything, much less cigars.

34:32.420 --> 34:34.880
[Eerie music]

34:40.428 --> 34:44.563
I couldn't figure out why part of
what I was looking at wasn't there.

34:44.565 --> 34:47.864
It was just blacked out.

34:53.106 --> 34:58.558
I realized that what I was looking at
was a dark figure in the shape of a man.

34:58.559 --> 35:02.816
And he had a cowboy hat
on the top of his head.

35:02.817 --> 35:03.817
Mark.

35:03.818 --> 35:09.458
And it was very scary. I
mean, I was frozen with shock.

35:10.041 --> 35:13.780
Suddenly I noticed the
shadow of a person...

35:13.781 --> 35:17.997
And I was the only person in the attic.

35:17.998 --> 35:21.178
I couldn't believe it.

35:23.838 --> 35:28.398
It was as though
somebody was leading me.

35:30.845 --> 35:34.565
I see a brown piece of paper.

35:38.386 --> 35:40.486
[Grunts]

35:46.159 --> 35:48.319
[Roaring]

35:54.010 --> 35:56.470
It was gone.

35:57.471 --> 36:02.811
Both Reagan and Desi had
seen a woman in the house.

36:02.837 --> 36:06.045
I thought it was very odd
that I wasn't seeing a woman;

36:06.046 --> 36:08.812
I was seeing a man.

36:08.813 --> 36:12.893
I wanted to know who this man was.

36:12.951 --> 36:17.151
There scattered are all these letters.

36:17.580 --> 36:22.012
And these letters are
addressed to Ladell.

36:22.013 --> 36:27.893
These were letters from a man
named Prentiss Savage in 1948.

36:30.856 --> 36:34.032
I realized that this is a love letter.

36:34.033 --> 36:39.433
Written to Ladell a couple
of months before she died.

36:39.998 --> 36:43.787
I thought that these letters
that I held in my hands,

36:43.788 --> 36:47.018
were possibly the answer.

36:47.019 --> 36:50.859
To that mystery, that question...

36:51.242 --> 36:54.182
Why did Ladell die?

36:57.382 --> 37:02.242
In March 1948, Prentiss
is visiting Monticello.

37:03.522 --> 37:05.827
He and Ladell had known each other.

37:05.828 --> 37:07.557
They had even dated.

37:07.558 --> 37:09.994
But they ended up marrying other people.

37:09.995 --> 37:11.662
[Knocking]

37:11.663 --> 37:16.133
And then they don't see
each other for 35 years.

37:16.134 --> 37:21.238
And he writes in one of his
letters about what he's thinking.

37:21.239 --> 37:26.443
He's wondering whether she's as
beautiful as she was when she was younger.

37:26.444 --> 37:29.804
[Sweeping orchestral music]

37:32.518 --> 37:37.138
And he writes that he
wasn't disappointed.

37:38.490 --> 37:44.370
So in March 1948, Ladell and
Prentiss rekindle their romance.

37:47.966 --> 37:51.986
His letters become truly passionate.

37:52.203 --> 37:57.483
<i>These last five days will
live in my memory always.</i>

37:58.577 --> 38:01.679
<i>As the happiest ones in my entire life.</i>

38:01.680 --> 38:03.514
<i>I love you.</i>

38:03.515 --> 38:08.152
<i>Don't ever forget I'm
thinking of you always.</i>

38:08.153 --> 38:14.053
He insists in his letters that
he's going to divorce his wife.

38:14.104 --> 38:18.004
When I got to October of 1948...

38:18.564 --> 38:22.344
I noticed a shift in the tone.

38:22.399 --> 38:25.897
He was frustrated with Ladell...

38:25.898 --> 38:29.678
Pressuring him to make progress.

38:31.109 --> 38:34.144
Then he wrote that last letter...

38:34.145 --> 38:36.305
[Sobbing]

38:36.682 --> 38:39.262
And he said...

38:39.327 --> 38:43.520
That he didn't know when, if ever...

38:43.521 --> 38:47.424
He was going to be able to
free himself of his marriage.

38:47.425 --> 38:49.585
[Sobbing]

39:00.606 --> 39:03.641
And there was silence.

39:03.642 --> 39:07.602
Ladell's death certificate arrived.

39:12.612 --> 39:16.430
The word suicide seemed
so large on the page.

39:16.431 --> 39:22.331
The feeling that I had when I read that on
the death certificate was just incredible.

39:22.729 --> 39:26.209
It was just incredibly sad.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.769
I was in the attic by myself.

39:29.770 --> 39:32.540
I looked up, and...

39:32.541 --> 39:36.381
I saw a woman coming toward me.

39:36.844 --> 39:38.511
She was looking right at me.

39:38.512 --> 39:41.152
[Dramatic music]

39:43.691 --> 39:45.731
[Music]

39:48.284 --> 39:49.964
_.

39:54.011 --> 39:55.691
_.

40:00.369 --> 40:02.632
[Footsteps approaching].

40:02.633 --> 40:04.834
I was startled.

40:04.835 --> 40:07.475
I look again...

40:08.618 --> 40:11.207
And it's Rebecca.

40:11.208 --> 40:13.810
You need to take a look at this.

40:13.811 --> 40:17.747
Rebecca showed me
Ladell's death certificate.

40:17.748 --> 40:21.588
My immediate reaction was horror.

40:21.849 --> 40:27.286
The death certificate stated that
she died by mercury cyanide poisoning.

40:27.287 --> 40:31.847
I noticed that it was
right at Christmas.

40:35.096 --> 40:40.996
From doing my research, I knew her
Mother always threw a Christmas party.

40:46.491 --> 40:51.010
On Christmas night, 1948, Ladell
attended her Mother's Christmas party.

40:51.011 --> 40:53.713
[Indistinct chatter]

40:53.714 --> 40:57.280
Prentiss promised in more
than one of his letters.

40:57.281 --> 41:03.161
- That they would be together at Christmas.
- [Knock at door]

41:06.030 --> 41:10.770
Christmas came, and
Prentiss didn't show up.

41:10.839 --> 41:15.444
And I believe that that was the
thing that pushed her over the edge.

41:15.445 --> 41:18.085
[Dramatic music]

41:18.783 --> 41:21.423
[Glass shatters]

41:28.726 --> 41:34.486
Late in the evening she prepared
herself a glass of punch.

41:44.832 --> 41:48.750
She'd used the punch
to mask the taste...

41:48.751 --> 41:52.471
Of the mercury cyanide tablets.

41:59.582 --> 42:01.742
[Gagging]

42:05.365 --> 42:07.165
Ah!

42:08.505 --> 42:11.265
[Scream continues]

42:14.244 --> 42:20.144
I felt sad for her, I felt someone should
have reached out to her and done something.

42:22.294 --> 42:27.400
I have personally gone from not
believing in spirits at all to...

42:27.401 --> 42:30.761
Being completely convinced.

42:31.277 --> 42:35.722
I think Ladell wanted me to find those
letters, I think Ladell in essence,

42:35.723 --> 42:39.143
showed me where they were.

42:40.072 --> 42:45.172
I think she was ready
for her story to be told.

42:46.939 --> 42:50.989
I would like to hope that
by sharing her story...

42:50.990 --> 42:53.942
She can finally feel at peace.
