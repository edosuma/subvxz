GREGORIO: Come on, we've all
noticed the change in Pride.

01:18.491 --> 01:20.391
He's got a little extra
bounce in his step,

01:20.393 --> 01:22.660
few more smiles,
a little cologne.

01:22.662 --> 01:25.363
I'm pretty sure that
cologne is Sebastian's.

01:25.365 --> 01:26.998
It's part of his
new agent makeover.

01:27.000 --> 01:28.966
Pride's been different,
ever since Rita got back--

01:28.968 --> 01:30.968
who, by the way,
calls him all the time now.

01:30.970 --> 01:33.571
Well, she is a JAG
Reservist and an A.D.A.,

01:33.573 --> 01:34.839
so it's just
probably business.

01:34.841 --> 01:36.407
See, now that's
your problem, Lasalle.

01:36.409 --> 01:38.109
If you can't see the obvious
romance in the world,

01:38.111 --> 01:39.777
how do you expect to ever
get it for yourself?

01:39.779 --> 01:41.412
Gregorio, Gregorio.

01:41.414 --> 01:44.482
I don't need any help finding
"romance," all right?

01:44.484 --> 01:46.017
I'm doing just fine,
thank you.

01:46.019 --> 01:47.718
You're doing just great,
knucklehead.

01:48.988 --> 01:50.388
(exhales)

01:50.390 --> 01:51.956
LASALLE: Looks like one
heck of a bar fight.

01:51.958 --> 01:53.524
PRIDE:
More like an assault.

01:53.526 --> 01:55.726
One of the victims recognized
a Marine Corps tattoo

01:55.728 --> 01:57.995
on the attacker,
so NOPD called us in.

01:57.997 --> 01:59.363
We get an I.D.?

01:59.365 --> 02:01.199
Sebastian's working on it.

02:01.201 --> 02:02.433
Assailant left one dead,

02:02.435 --> 02:04.302
three in the hospital.

02:04.304 --> 02:06.437
Two more ran off
as NOPD arrived.

02:06.439 --> 02:08.172
One marine
took out six guys?

02:08.174 --> 02:09.407
Without firing a shot.

02:09.408 --> 02:10.574
Only weapon discharged

02:10.577 --> 02:11.976
apparently belongs
to the victim.

02:11.978 --> 02:13.044
Morning, team.

02:13.046 --> 02:14.679
(sniffs, groans)

02:14.681 --> 02:15.847
What?

02:17.484 --> 02:18.850
What do you got, Sebastian?

02:18.852 --> 02:21.385
Uh, I got a blood trail
that indicates

02:21.387 --> 02:23.988
the victim might've shot
our suspect before being killed.

02:23.990 --> 02:26.457
Sergeant John Brossette,
U.S. Marine Corps.

02:26.459 --> 02:28.626
I didn't even need
his blood to I.D. him;

02:28.628 --> 02:29.961
he left plenty of prints.

02:29.963 --> 02:31.796
Think he'd be a little more
careful than that.

02:31.798 --> 02:33.097
Well, either that or he didn't
care for some reason.

02:33.099 --> 02:35.099
Anyway, I got
a local address,

02:35.101 --> 02:36.868
but anything past that,
I need security clearance.

02:36.870 --> 02:38.302
Could be Special Ops.

02:38.304 --> 02:40.471
Yeah. Look, Percy's back
at the squad room.

02:40.473 --> 02:41.839
Get her what you know.

02:41.841 --> 02:43.908
Tell her to contact
MARSOC to get clearance.

02:43.910 --> 02:45.209
GREGORIO: There are
three security cameras

02:45.211 --> 02:46.410
on both sides of the bar.

02:46.412 --> 02:47.812
You think we could get
something from the feeds?

02:47.814 --> 02:49.547
Yeah, I was just about to check.
Okay, cool.

02:51.818 --> 02:53.651
Our victim is
Terrence Hayes...

02:53.653 --> 02:55.186
(camera clicking)

02:55.188 --> 02:56.954
...owner of the bar.

02:56.956 --> 02:58.289
Prelim background check shows

02:58.291 --> 03:00.158
he's got a long history
of felony convictions.

03:00.160 --> 03:01.792
Yeah, unfortunately
for Mr. Hayes,

03:01.794 --> 03:03.361
he also has a
recent history

03:03.363 --> 03:04.695
of being tortured.

03:04.697 --> 03:07.999
Has bruising, compound
fracture in the arm,

03:08.001 --> 03:09.233
broken fingers,

03:09.235 --> 03:10.735
looks like one at a time, too.

03:10.737 --> 03:13.671
And based on
the severed spinal cord,

03:13.673 --> 03:15.940
likely cause of death
was asphyxia.

03:15.942 --> 03:17.308
Suspect broke his neck.

03:17.310 --> 03:18.709
GREGORIO:
So, what is this, revenge

03:18.711 --> 03:20.011
or payback for something?

03:20.013 --> 03:21.245
Could be a dirty marine.

03:21.247 --> 03:23.214
They were in a deal together
that went sideways.

03:23.216 --> 03:24.949
Well, whatever it is,
Brossette's dangerous.

03:24.951 --> 03:27.185
We need to get him off the
street and into custody fast.

03:27.187 --> 03:28.219
Get a warrant.

03:28.221 --> 03:29.220
Check his house.

03:29.222 --> 03:30.688
I'll work with Percy.

03:30.690 --> 03:33.324
We'll look into Brossette
and Hayes both.

03:33.326 --> 03:35.326
Best way
to find our marine

03:35.328 --> 03:36.427
is to figure out
what the hell happened here.

03:36.429 --> 03:37.762
SEBASTIAN:
I got their surveillance feed.

03:37.764 --> 03:40.064
And I got to say, aside
from the fact that, you know,

03:40.066 --> 03:42.099
somebody's dead,
this is pretty badass.

03:50.176 --> 03:54.245
Damn, that guy's
got some serious skill.

03:54.247 --> 03:56.514
Wow, so... (chuckles)

03:56.516 --> 04:00.084
he gets shot, barely bats
an eye, and just like that,

04:00.086 --> 04:01.252
kills a man.

04:01.254 --> 04:02.553
PRIDE: Well, doesn't
look like that was

04:02.555 --> 04:03.554
his intention.

04:03.556 --> 04:05.089
He was walking away.

04:05.091 --> 04:06.924
Still don't know what he was
doing there. What'd you find?

04:06.926 --> 04:08.926
Not much, just that
Sergeant Brossette's

04:08.928 --> 04:10.595
as highly trained as they come.

04:10.597 --> 04:12.797
He's a Force Recon team leader.

04:12.799 --> 04:15.266
So what's he doing going after a
small-time felon in Clearwater?

04:15.268 --> 04:16.666
And why do it like that?

04:16.668 --> 04:18.603
Force Recon's trained
in stealth tactics.

04:18.605 --> 04:19.870
Brossette could've
taken them out

04:19.872 --> 04:22.072
without anybody
ever finding out.

04:22.075 --> 04:23.274
PTSD?

04:23.276 --> 04:24.742
PRIDE: Looked pretty
in control to me.

04:24.744 --> 04:27.044
Plus, he clearly
went after Hayes.

04:27.046 --> 04:29.547
You find any connection there?

04:29.549 --> 04:31.749
No, I checked NOPD, FBI, NCIC,

04:31.751 --> 04:32.917
nothing,
other than the fact

04:32.919 --> 04:34.885
that they both live
in Clearwater.

04:34.887 --> 04:39.090
And Brossette...
is originally from Haiti.

04:39.092 --> 04:41.259
He met the marines
doing disaster relief there,

04:41.261 --> 04:43.694
emigrated to the U.S.
with his wife, Amelia,

04:43.696 --> 04:46.330
and then enlisted.

04:46.332 --> 04:47.765
You talk to his wife?

04:47.767 --> 04:49.800
I left her a message, but
she hasn't responded yet.

04:49.802 --> 04:51.035
(cell phone ringing)

04:51.037 --> 04:52.370
Not much to go on.

04:52.372 --> 04:54.438
Yeah, Chris.

04:54.440 --> 04:56.607
LASALLE: I'm leaving
Brossette's house now, King.

04:56.609 --> 04:57.908
PRIDE:
Any sign of trouble?

04:57.910 --> 04:59.176
The door locked
when you got there?

04:59.178 --> 05:00.444
Yeah, we had to bust in.

05:00.446 --> 05:02.413
Everything inside
was normal, though.

05:02.415 --> 05:04.348
Any sign of him
or his wife?

05:04.350 --> 05:06.550
No, none.
Looks like Amelia Brossette

05:06.552 --> 05:09.086
works with an advocacy group
that helps immigrants.

05:09.088 --> 05:11.355
Her calendar says she's at
a federal detention center

05:11.357 --> 05:12.857
in Oakdale today with clients.

05:12.859 --> 05:14.125
(whispers):
I'm on it.

05:14.127 --> 05:15.026
Yeah, Gregorio's

05:15.028 --> 05:16.027
talking to neighbors now.

05:16.029 --> 05:16.994
Maybe she found something.

05:16.996 --> 05:18.129
All right, well,
sooner the better.

05:18.131 --> 05:20.298
Keep digging,
but be careful.

05:20.300 --> 05:22.133
Don't want you running into
Brossette without backup.

05:22.135 --> 05:23.534
Copy that.

05:25.371 --> 05:27.104
Hey.

05:27.106 --> 05:29.340
I've seen some struggling
neighborhoods since I got back,

05:29.342 --> 05:31.442
but nothing like
this one. It's sad.

05:31.444 --> 05:33.811
Yeah, Clearwater got hit
pretty hard by Katrina,

05:33.813 --> 05:36.080
never recovered.
Doesn't make sense, though.

05:36.082 --> 05:38.015
It's right by the river.
You'd think this would be

05:38.017 --> 05:39.984
one of the first places
to bounce back.

05:39.986 --> 05:41.752
Yeah, I had three NOPD buddies
that used to work the area,

05:41.754 --> 05:43.321
and they all got reassigned
to The Quarter.

05:43.323 --> 05:44.889
Got to protect
the tourists, right?

05:44.891 --> 05:46.724
Hey, did you find
anything on Brossette?

05:46.726 --> 05:49.427
'Cause I sure didn't, and King,
he seems a little nervous.

05:49.429 --> 05:50.528
I don't blame him.

05:50.530 --> 05:52.063
Only thing I got was good.

05:52.065 --> 05:53.364
Neighbors sing
the Brossettes' praises

05:53.366 --> 05:54.732
like they're some
kind of saints.

05:54.734 --> 05:56.701
Woman over there,
she says that

05:56.703 --> 05:58.302
if it wasn't for him,

05:58.304 --> 05:59.937
Clearwater would be
overrun by crime.

05:59.939 --> 06:01.405
He does what the cops don't.

06:01.407 --> 06:04.208
So, what? He's some kind
of guardian angel?

06:04.210 --> 06:06.844
I mean, doesn't exactly jibe
with taking out six guys

06:06.846 --> 06:09.080
at a bar and killing a man,
does it?

06:20.293 --> 06:22.193
(groans)

06:22.195 --> 06:24.562
(panting)

06:24.564 --> 06:26.464
<i>(cell phone ringing)</i>

06:28.267 --> 06:30.368
(Pride sighs)

06:30.370 --> 06:32.603
I let Oakdale know we wanted

06:32.605 --> 06:34.939
to talk to Brossette's
wife when she showed,

06:34.941 --> 06:37.041
but I did find something
that might help.

06:37.043 --> 06:39.510
Two days ago,
bar owner, Hayes,

06:39.512 --> 06:42.680
deposited almost ten
grand, all in cash,

06:42.682 --> 06:45.082
three times more than any
deposit he'd made all year.

06:45.084 --> 06:47.118
Find out how
he got the money,

06:47.120 --> 06:49.320
might give us a reason for
Brossette's attack. Good work.

06:49.322 --> 06:51.288
Thanks.
Let's go to the hospital,

06:51.290 --> 06:53.057
find out what
the other victims know.

06:53.059 --> 06:56.060
(cell phone ringing)

06:56.896 --> 06:58.262
Um...

06:58.264 --> 07:00.531
you not gonna answer that?

07:00.533 --> 07:03.000
Nope. Mayor's called three times
already this morning.

07:03.002 --> 07:05.102
God, what does he want?
Who knows?

07:05.104 --> 07:07.104
Could be something
about this case,

07:07.106 --> 07:08.806
could be he's nervous
'cause I'm coming after him

07:08.808 --> 07:10.608
for the murder of Javier Garcia.

07:11.911 --> 07:14.211
Right now, all I care about
is finding Sergeant Brossette

07:14.213 --> 07:15.646
before he hurts anyone else.

07:15.648 --> 07:18.215
SEBASTIAN: Hey, Pride. We might
have a lead on Brossette,

07:18.217 --> 07:19.417
and I think it's pretty cool.

07:19.419 --> 07:20.785
And by "we,"
cowboy means me,

07:20.787 --> 07:22.353
the one who actually
found the lead.

07:22.355 --> 07:24.422
See? You are upset,
just admit it.

07:24.424 --> 07:25.990
You don't want me
sharing your office.

07:25.992 --> 07:27.992
I have no trouble sharing,
but I do have trouble

07:27.994 --> 07:29.960
with you disinfecting my desk
all the time.

07:29.962 --> 07:31.228
Smell like bad cologne.

07:31.230 --> 07:32.263
That actually is a-a cologne.

07:32.265 --> 07:34.331
Is it too much, you think?

07:34.333 --> 07:35.299
The lead, fellas.

07:35.301 --> 07:36.567
PATTON:
Okay, check it out.

07:36.569 --> 07:38.269
I took a closer look
at the surveillance footage,

07:38.271 --> 07:39.336
zooming in on the victim's face.

07:39.338 --> 07:41.806
Yeah, watch what happens
when Patton enhances it.

07:46.312 --> 07:48.512
I'm sorry, what exactly
are we looking at?

07:48.514 --> 07:49.647
We're looking at his lips.

07:49.649 --> 07:51.649
PATTON: And we're using
cutting-edge software

07:51.651 --> 07:54.351
used by the CIA
to read said lips.

07:54.353 --> 07:57.455
COMPUTERIZED VOICE (distorted):
Er-Oh-Emer-Emerald Paw-Pawn.

07:57.457 --> 07:59.790
There-ee-that a-all I know.

07:59.792 --> 08:02.493
Emerald Pawn, that's all I know.

08:02.495 --> 08:04.195
Emerald Pawn?
Where is that?

08:04.197 --> 08:05.963
It's in Clearwater.
It's right near the bar.

08:05.965 --> 08:07.631
PATTON:
That must be important,

08:07.633 --> 08:09.633
'cause Brossette took off
as soon as he heard that.

08:09.635 --> 08:11.502
Not before Hayes took
another shot at him.

08:11.504 --> 08:12.703
That's when Brossette
killed him.

08:12.705 --> 08:15.139
All right,
call Lasalle and Gregorio.

08:15.141 --> 08:18.008
Tell them we will meet them
at the pawn shop,

08:18.010 --> 08:22.246
but to wait for us,
in case Brossette's there.

08:28.187 --> 08:29.320
Any sign of Brossette?

08:29.322 --> 08:30.621
LASALLE:
Not yet,

08:30.623 --> 08:32.188
but the owner just
opened up the shop.

08:32.191 --> 08:33.390
Vadim Reznik.

08:34.126 --> 08:35.359
Record's clean.

08:35.361 --> 08:36.827
How you want
to play this?

08:36.828 --> 08:38.395
Let's talk to Reznik,

08:38.397 --> 08:40.731
see if he has any idea why
Brossette's so interested...

08:40.732 --> 08:42.566
(gunshots in distance)

08:45.404 --> 08:46.570
(panting)

08:46.572 --> 08:48.339
Hayes is already dead.

08:48.341 --> 08:50.608
You want to be next?

08:50.610 --> 08:51.742
Federal agents! Don't move!

08:51.744 --> 08:53.444
Get your hands in the air!

08:53.446 --> 08:55.312
Drop the knife!

08:55.314 --> 08:57.248
LASALLE: Drop the knife
and raise your hands!

08:57.250 --> 08:59.383
Let's go,
get them up!

09:00.386 --> 09:01.886
SONJA:
Come on, Reznik.

09:01.888 --> 09:03.888
Move, move, move!

09:03.890 --> 09:06.423
PRIDE:
Sergeant Brossette, NCIS!

09:06.425 --> 09:09.193
Get on your knees now.

09:14.433 --> 09:16.100
Gregorio, cuff him.

09:18.971 --> 09:20.137
(grunts)

09:33.586 --> 09:35.419
(groans)

09:39.759 --> 09:42.459
(groaning)

09:44.263 --> 09:45.663
(panting)

09:46.399 --> 09:49.066
Everybody... all right?

09:49.068 --> 09:51.235
Define "all right."

09:53.239 --> 09:55.339
Reznik got away, too.

10:01.414 --> 10:03.514
Who is that guy?

10:03.516 --> 10:05.149
(sniffs)

10:23.806 --> 10:24.838
(exhales)

10:24.840 --> 10:26.440
Oh. Might need stitches.

10:26.442 --> 10:28.008
Maybe you ought
to go to the E.R.

10:28.010 --> 10:29.776
I'm too humiliated
to go to the E.R.

10:29.778 --> 10:31.545
I don't want anybody else
knowing that one guy

10:31.547 --> 10:33.180
kicked all our asses.

10:33.182 --> 10:35.182
Yeah, I'm feeling
a little déjà vu.

10:35.184 --> 10:37.451
It's not the first time we've
been in here licking our wounds.

10:37.453 --> 10:38.685
Lucky none of y'all got killed.

10:38.687 --> 10:40.153
PRIDE: Yeah, don't think
it was luck, Loretta.

10:40.155 --> 10:42.856
Brossette had a chance,
held back instead.

10:42.858 --> 10:45.125
Yeah, and he didn't have to;
he already killed a guy.

10:45.127 --> 10:46.359
Well, the bar owner
could've been self-defense.

10:46.361 --> 10:48.028
I mean,
think about it.

10:48.030 --> 10:50.931
He took us out just enough
so he could get away.

10:50.933 --> 10:53.133
Hindsight,
probably good

10:53.135 --> 10:54.167
we didn't get a shot off.

10:54.169 --> 10:56.336
Question is:
what's he want so bad?

10:56.338 --> 10:58.104
Whatever it is,
Reznik must know.

10:58.106 --> 11:01.107
Brossette was obviously pissed
that the guy got away.

11:01.109 --> 11:02.809
Which means he'll be
going after him again.

11:02.811 --> 11:04.878
But if we can find
Reznik first...

11:04.880 --> 11:06.428
He'll lead us
right to Brossette.

11:06.429 --> 11:08.309
You sure you really want
to find Brossette again?

11:08.333 --> 11:09.617
That's a good point, Doc.

11:09.618 --> 11:11.751
(cell phone ringing) We're not gonna
underestimate him again.

11:11.753 --> 11:13.320
Next time, we'll be prepared.

11:14.756 --> 11:16.723
Ah.

11:16.725 --> 11:18.024
Hey, Rita.

11:18.026 --> 11:19.292
RITA:
Dwayne, we need to talk.

11:19.294 --> 11:20.360
Can you hold a sec?

11:20.362 --> 11:21.294
Of course.

11:21.296 --> 11:22.696
Gregorio,

11:22.698 --> 11:24.564
you and Sonja see if
you can find anything

11:24.566 --> 11:27.501
to connect Reznik to
Brossette or the bar owner.

11:27.503 --> 11:30.237
Chris, take Sebastian
back to the pawn shop.

11:30.239 --> 11:33.073
We need to find something
to help us locate Reznik.

11:33.075 --> 11:35.075
You got it.
Sorry about that, Rita.

11:35.077 --> 11:37.544
Okay, I give. Who's Rita?

11:37.546 --> 11:39.546
Well, that's the million-dollar
question, ain't it?

11:44.419 --> 11:45.552
Anybody seen Sebastian?

11:45.554 --> 11:47.787
In his office.
In my office.

11:47.789 --> 11:49.256
Thanks.

11:49.258 --> 11:51.758
Any luck on seeing where
Brossette ran off to?

11:51.760 --> 11:55.028
Nope. That marine managed to
avoid every security camera

11:55.030 --> 11:58.031
anywhere around that pawn shop;
the man is a ghost.

11:58.033 --> 12:00.567
We still can't find his wife,
either; never showed up to work.

12:00.569 --> 12:01.935
PATTON:
I couldn't get a GPS

12:01.937 --> 12:03.870
on her cell phone;
could be she turned it off.

12:03.872 --> 12:06.112
She doesn't want to be found
no more than her hubby does.

12:06.608 --> 12:08.341
All right, try going back
and looking through

12:08.343 --> 12:10.543
the security cams, see if
you can find Reznik instead.

12:10.545 --> 12:12.779
Find Reznik, find Brossette.

12:12.781 --> 12:15.114
Exactly.

12:15.116 --> 12:16.582
Everything all right?

12:16.584 --> 12:19.919
Rita just called as an A.D.A.

12:19.921 --> 12:23.523
Says that Hamilton just
held a press conference.

12:23.525 --> 12:25.691
Threw me and NCIS under the bus

12:25.693 --> 12:27.627
for not catching

12:27.629 --> 12:29.862
Sergeant Brossette fast enough.

12:29.864 --> 12:31.764
Rita says that Hamilton

12:31.766 --> 12:33.800
wants the D.A.'s office
to investigate.

12:33.802 --> 12:35.301
What? That's not fair.

12:35.303 --> 12:36.736
Why would Hamilton do that?

12:36.738 --> 12:37.970
Only one reason:

12:37.972 --> 12:39.539
to get my attention.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.741
Now he's got it.

12:46.514 --> 12:48.948
I'm so sorry, Mr. Mayor.
I couldn't stop him.

12:48.950 --> 12:50.983
HAMILTON: Oh, that's all
right, I'm used to it.

12:50.985 --> 12:52.752
I'll call you back.

12:52.754 --> 12:54.654
Oh, a-a return phone call
would've sufficed, Dwayne.

12:54.656 --> 12:55.988
That's all I'm saying.

12:55.990 --> 12:57.857
- What do you want?
- Should I call security?

12:57.859 --> 13:00.193
Nah, he ain't gonna hurt me.

13:01.930 --> 13:04.063
You know, whether you
like it or not, Dwayne,

13:04.065 --> 13:05.765
I'm the mayor.
(door closes)

13:05.767 --> 13:08.034
And that means when I call you,
you damn well better

13:08.036 --> 13:09.735
pick up that phone next time,
you understand?

13:09.737 --> 13:11.003
Or, what, you're gonna hold
another press conference?

13:11.005 --> 13:12.839
Try and blame me
for your screwups?

13:12.841 --> 13:14.373
My screwups?

13:14.375 --> 13:16.742
There's a maniac marine
running loose in the city.

13:16.744 --> 13:18.010
How is that my fault?

13:18.012 --> 13:19.245
He's not loose
in the city,

13:19.247 --> 13:21.180
he's in Clearwater.

13:21.182 --> 13:23.850
No excuse for
what he did,

13:23.852 --> 13:25.651
but if you hadn't pulled
basic resources,

13:25.653 --> 13:27.086
like police...
Oh, man,

13:27.088 --> 13:28.621
that's just media crap,
and you know it.

13:28.623 --> 13:30.056
They're just trying to put
a spin on everything...

13:30.058 --> 13:31.591
Not spin, it's real.

13:31.593 --> 13:33.659
You've left Clearwater
high and dry for far too long,

13:33.661 --> 13:35.561
and this is what happens.
You don't know.

13:35.563 --> 13:37.263
This whole city
has no resources.

13:37.265 --> 13:38.798
I had to make some choices.

13:38.800 --> 13:41.834
Choices which benefit you
more than the city.

13:41.836 --> 13:43.736
Benefits like the ones
Javier Garcia was gonna share

13:43.738 --> 13:45.738
with the FBI...
Ah, no! No, no, no!

13:45.740 --> 13:47.173
That's it.
...before he was killed.

13:47.175 --> 13:48.307
I'm tired, I'm tired

13:48.309 --> 13:50.343
of your insinuations
and your implications.

13:50.345 --> 13:52.411
And if you think
I have something to do

13:52.413 --> 13:56.315
with Garcia's death,
then you put up or you shut up!

14:01.523 --> 14:04.023
Now, in the meantime,
you do your damn job.

14:04.025 --> 14:05.625
You catch this marine,

14:05.627 --> 14:08.161
and you keep him
and Clearwater off of the news,

14:08.163 --> 14:10.796
or I'll make sure
you stay on it.

14:13.168 --> 14:14.400
(intercom beeps)

14:14.402 --> 14:16.602
You can call security now.

14:26.581 --> 14:28.247
(door closes)

14:32.220 --> 14:34.554
You know, it'd be
a lot easier to find

14:34.556 --> 14:35.922
a connection to Brossette

14:35.924 --> 14:37.323
if Reznik was a little
bit more organized.

14:37.325 --> 14:38.658
Look at this.

14:38.660 --> 14:41.093
You think even a pawn shop
would use a computer these days,

14:41.095 --> 14:42.795
at least a stolen one.

14:42.797 --> 14:45.264
Yeah, a lot of what draws
folks to these kind of places

14:45.266 --> 14:47.066
is things aren't
tracked as easily.

14:47.068 --> 14:48.701
Lot of cash transactions.

14:48.703 --> 14:50.002
Yeah, that might explain
where the bar victim

14:50.004 --> 14:51.370
got his ten grand from.

14:51.372 --> 14:53.973
Still, doesn't connect
Reznik to Charles Bronson.

14:53.975 --> 14:55.174
Charles who?

14:55.176 --> 14:56.776
Come on,
man, really?

14:56.778 --> 14:58.010
Charles Bronson? You know?

14:58.012 --> 14:59.212
<i>Death Wish?</i>

14:59.214 --> 15:00.580
It's a morally
questionable film

15:00.582 --> 15:02.381
about vigilantism?

15:02.383 --> 15:04.483
Guardian angel,
just like Sergeant Brossette?

15:04.485 --> 15:06.018
First one was a huge
hit, but the sequels

15:06.020 --> 15:07.820
just got ridiculous.
Sebastian...

15:07.822 --> 15:09.255
Although, in the third one,

15:09.257 --> 15:11.057
Bronson shoots a bad guy
with a rocket launcher.

15:11.059 --> 15:12.779
- That's actually pretty sweet.
- Sebastian.

15:12.961 --> 15:14.594
What's “acepero...”

15:14.596 --> 15:16.229
Acepromazine?
That's it.

15:16.231 --> 15:17.630
An animal tranquilizer.

15:17.632 --> 15:20.032
It's usually used for
dogs and horses. Why?

15:20.034 --> 15:22.201
Well, I just found
a bunch of it in here.

15:23.705 --> 15:27.907
Why does a pawn shop
have animal tranquilizer?

15:29.310 --> 15:31.577
Any progress finding Reznik?

15:31.579 --> 15:33.212
SONJA:
Maybe.

15:33.214 --> 15:35.248
Just got off the phone
with Lasalle and Sebastian.

15:35.250 --> 15:38.150
They found a stash of
animal tranquilizers

15:38.152 --> 15:39.518
hidden in Reznik's shop.

15:39.520 --> 15:40.820
Animal tranquilizers?

15:40.822 --> 15:42.355
Yeah, turns out,
Reznik's brother-in-law

15:42.357 --> 15:43.789
works at a vet hospital.

15:43.791 --> 15:46.459
Yeah, and Patton tapped
into Reznik's cell.

15:46.461 --> 15:48.694
Turns out, Reznik's been making
a lot of late-night visits

15:48.696 --> 15:50.463
to the vet hospital.

15:50.465 --> 15:52.064
Doesn't give us a connection
to Brossette, but...

15:52.066 --> 15:54.533
But it could give us Reznik if
he's going back to the hospital.

15:54.535 --> 15:58.004
Which is where Brossette
might be waiting for him, too.

15:58.006 --> 15:59.238
Worth a shot.

15:59.240 --> 16:00.806
Good work.

16:00.808 --> 16:02.408
Have Sebastian and Christopher

16:02.410 --> 16:04.577
meet us back here
so we can game plan.

16:04.579 --> 16:06.746
Where you going?

16:06.748 --> 16:09.181
Borrow a few things
from the sheriff's office,

16:09.183 --> 16:12.151
so Brossette doesn't catch us
off guard again.

16:40.148 --> 16:41.881
Brossette's
got to be close.

16:41.883 --> 16:43.382
LASALLE:
Copy that, King.

16:43.384 --> 16:45.885
In position,

Be all right in a minute.

17:36.771 --> 17:39.638
Please, this isn't
what you think.

17:39.640 --> 17:40.773
Yeah, tell it to the judge.

17:40.775 --> 17:42.842
They've taken my wife!

17:43.611 --> 17:45.845
That's why I
went after them.

17:47.181 --> 17:48.714
That's why
I'm doing this.

17:50.151 --> 17:54.553
If we don't catch them in time,
I may never see her again.

18:10.345 --> 18:11.844

It's fine.

18:18.786 --> 18:20.853
Triaged.
I only care about Amelia.

murder...

18:28.696 --> 18:30.763
Murder? No way.

18:30.765 --> 18:32.365
Hayes shot at me, twice.

18:32.367 --> 18:33.699
It was self-defense.

18:33.701 --> 18:35.368
Open to interpretation.

18:35.370 --> 18:38.571
You attacked him first,
with lethal force.

18:38.573 --> 18:40.907
I only wanted to find my wife.

18:40.909 --> 18:42.608

we may be able

Night before last,

18:57.992 --> 19:00.927
when I came home,
Amelia wasn't there.

19:00.929 --> 19:02.795
I assumed she was with a client.

19:02.797 --> 19:04.163
She helps
new immigrants,

19:04.165 --> 19:06.165
people like we once were.

19:06.167 --> 19:08.534
Helps them find jobs,
places to live.

19:10.605 --> 19:12.238
She work late a lot?

19:12.240 --> 19:13.272
Never.

19:13.274 --> 19:15.141
I called her, but it
went to voice mail.

19:15.143 --> 19:16.909
Called her friends, too,

19:16.911 --> 19:19.011
people she works
with, nothing.

19:19.013 --> 19:20.646
I knew something was wrong.

19:20.648 --> 19:21.736
Why didn't you just
call the cops?

19:21.760 --> 19:23.083
I did.

19:23.084 --> 19:25.318
But they wouldn't do
anything for 48 hours,

19:25.320 --> 19:27.219
and I knew I couldn't
wait that long.

19:27.221 --> 19:30.756
Amelia isn't the first person
to disappear from Clearwater.

19:30.758 --> 19:33.459
And what does that mean?

19:34.529 --> 19:37.196
There have been whispers
on the streets.

19:37.198 --> 19:39.665
Stories of immigrants
who arrived all alone,

19:39.667 --> 19:42.335
young women with no families,
suddenly vanish.

19:43.304 --> 19:45.304
NOPD look into it?

19:45.306 --> 19:46.639
Said they did,

19:46.641 --> 19:47.640
but the women aren't citizens,

19:47.642 --> 19:48.708
so there's nothing
they could do.

19:48.710 --> 19:50.209
The police hardly
come around

19:50.211 --> 19:51.744
Clearwater anymore, anyway.

19:51.746 --> 19:53.412
So, you decided to take matters

19:53.414 --> 19:55.314
into your own hands.
I had no choice!

19:55.316 --> 19:57.316
I wasn't going to let them
take my wife!

19:57.318 --> 19:59.518
Calm down, Brossette.

20:04.993 --> 20:07.426
I used my training,

20:07.428 --> 20:10.529
tracked down leads,

20:10.531 --> 20:12.465
learned a blue van
had been hanging around

20:12.467 --> 20:14.266
where Amelia was last seen.

20:14.268 --> 20:17.970
And that blue van
led you to Hayes.

20:17.972 --> 20:20.206
Who led me to Reznik.

20:21.676 --> 20:24.777
REZNIK:
<i>All I do is clean them up.</i>

20:25.613 --> 20:29.015
I take photos, that's it.

20:29.017 --> 20:31.250
Clean them up?

20:31.252 --> 20:33.853
What kind of
scumbag are you?

20:33.855 --> 20:36.188
These are women we're
talking about, not animals.

20:36.190 --> 20:38.724
Yeah, well, apparently
he treats them like animals.

20:40.094 --> 20:41.927
Sedates them
like animals, too.

20:41.929 --> 20:43.963
Is that so they
don't fight back?

20:43.965 --> 20:45.164
Huh, is that it?

20:45.166 --> 20:46.899
I swear to God,
I don't hurt them.

20:46.901 --> 20:48.801
These men, they're selling them.

20:48.803 --> 20:50.403
They're shipping them
out of the country.

20:50.405 --> 20:52.338
Human trafficking.

20:52.340 --> 20:55.474
You got any idea how many years
that gets you in federal prison?

20:55.476 --> 20:57.410
GREGORIO: You better
start talking, Reznik.

20:57.412 --> 20:59.745
You better tell us who
you hand those girls off to,

20:59.747 --> 21:02.214
or you'll never see the outside
of a jail cell again.

21:02.216 --> 21:04.250
REZNIK:
I don't know who.

21:04.252 --> 21:07.019
They don't want me to know
who, in case I get caught.

21:07.021 --> 21:08.788
I get them from Hayes.

21:08.790 --> 21:12.391
When I'm done, I make a call
on a burner cell and I leave.

21:12.393 --> 21:13.726
When I go back,

21:13.728 --> 21:17.363
the women are gone
and my cash is there.

21:17.365 --> 21:18.898
I just wait for the next batch.

21:18.900 --> 21:20.066
Batch?

21:23.171 --> 21:25.271
You're disgusting.

21:30.278 --> 21:31.577
PRIDE: Did you get
anything out of Reznik?

21:31.579 --> 21:33.379
Just enough to make me
sick to my stomach.

21:33.381 --> 21:35.047
I can't believe
this has been going on

21:35.049 --> 21:37.016
for as long as it has
without anybody finding out.

21:37.018 --> 21:38.484
Hey, but if it wasn't
for Brossette,

21:38.486 --> 21:39.819
they'd still be
getting away with it.

21:39.821 --> 21:40.886
Obviously,

21:40.888 --> 21:42.088
they took his wife by mistake.

21:42.090 --> 21:43.856
Didn't realize
who they were going up against.

21:43.858 --> 21:45.391
Yeah, question is: who are they?

21:45.393 --> 21:47.626
According to Reznik,
the trafficking ring

21:47.628 --> 21:49.662
is compartmentalized;
nobody knows who's next up

21:49.664 --> 21:51.097
on the food chain.
We got to hurry up

21:51.099 --> 21:52.665
before they get her
out of the country.

21:52.667 --> 21:55.334
But it's only been 36 hours
since she was taken.

21:55.336 --> 21:57.403
And it's not just Amelia
they're trying to get out.

21:57.405 --> 21:58.571
There's got to be others.

21:58.573 --> 21:59.772
And that takes time.

21:59.774 --> 22:01.073
That means we still
have a chance.

22:01.075 --> 22:03.209
Whoa, are we allowed
to go at it alone?

22:03.211 --> 22:05.377
We're NCIS; we
caught our marine.

22:05.379 --> 22:07.179
Shouldn't we
loop in NOPD, FBI?

22:07.181 --> 22:09.381
By the time we get through
all that bureaucracy,

22:09.383 --> 22:10.516
she'll be gone,

22:10.518 --> 22:12.384
and we can't let that happen.

22:12.386 --> 22:13.886
RITA:
Dwayne?

22:15.389 --> 22:17.089
Rita, what...

22:17.091 --> 22:18.257
what's going on?

22:18.259 --> 22:19.492
Hamilton sent me.

22:19.494 --> 22:21.594
Hamilton? What do you mean? Why?

22:21.596 --> 22:23.395
Because I'm both
JAG and A.D.A.,

22:23.397 --> 22:25.598
and Sergeant Brossette's case
could be heard in either court.

22:25.600 --> 22:26.765
GREGORIO:
Hold up,

22:26.767 --> 22:27.800
what case?

22:27.802 --> 22:29.201
Marine killed a civilian, right?

22:29.203 --> 22:32.538
And word is, you have
him in custody, Dwayne,

22:32.540 --> 22:33.539
so I'm here to take him in.

22:33.541 --> 22:34.673
And Hamilton sent you?

22:34.675 --> 22:38.043
He called the D.A.
and was pretty insistent.

22:38.045 --> 22:40.479
He already has a press
conference set up

22:40.481 --> 22:41.680
to announce the arrest.

22:41.682 --> 22:43.015
Why am I not surprised?

22:43.017 --> 22:44.517
I know how you feel
about Hamilton,

22:44.519 --> 22:47.553
but I have
to do my job.

22:47.555 --> 22:49.455
So, do you have Brossette
or don't you?

22:53.394 --> 22:54.960
Just give me a minute.

22:54.962 --> 22:55.928
What?

22:55.930 --> 22:56.896
Yeah, we'll be right back.

22:56.898 --> 22:59.331
Wait. Well, Dwayne...

22:59.333 --> 23:01.066
Patton, Sebastian?
RITA: Hello?

23:01.068 --> 23:02.601
Hey, wait, wait, whoa,
I know all of y'all

23:02.603 --> 23:04.336
are not moving in here, man.
Come on.

23:04.338 --> 23:05.671
Look, never mind that.

23:05.673 --> 23:07.540
Did you get anything
off of Reznik's burner?

23:07.542 --> 23:09.208
Nothing on it,
except for one number.

23:09.210 --> 23:11.410
It's the same number Reznik
been calling every week or so.

23:11.412 --> 23:13.078
It's got to be the next link
on the trafficking chain.

23:13.080 --> 23:15.347
So we are gonna help Brossette
find his wife.

23:15.349 --> 23:17.349
We're gonna try, but
we got to move fast.

23:17.351 --> 23:19.952
Might need Brossette
to help us, though.

23:19.954 --> 23:21.453
Wait here.

23:22.723 --> 23:24.356
I...
Hold that thought.

23:30.531 --> 23:32.464
I got an idea,

23:32.466 --> 23:33.766
but here's the deal.

23:33.768 --> 23:36.435
NOPD's waiting outside that door
to take you downtown,

23:36.437 --> 23:39.538
but I'm willing to try
and hold them and the A.D.A. off

23:39.540 --> 23:41.407
if you help me find your wife.

23:41.409 --> 23:43.075
So we're clear,

23:43.077 --> 23:45.844
probably won't help you avoid
charges, and it's dangerous.

23:45.846 --> 23:48.514
Tell me what I have to do.

23:48.516 --> 23:50.282
RITA: <i>Are you out of</i>
<i>your mind, Dwayne?</i>

23:50.284 --> 23:53.619
I'm telling you, it's not
as simple as you think.

23:53.621 --> 23:55.654
Pretty simple
from my point of view.

23:55.656 --> 23:56.956
I'm under strict orders.

23:56.958 --> 23:58.424
And I'm not asking
you to disobey them.

23:58.426 --> 24:01.493
All we want is
a little more time.

24:01.495 --> 24:02.628
12 hours, that's all.

24:02.630 --> 24:04.063
12 hours for what?

24:04.065 --> 24:05.130
To try and catch
the traffickers,

24:05.132 --> 24:06.232
get Brossette's wife back.

24:06.234 --> 24:08.467
Rita, listen, despite
what the mayor

24:08.469 --> 24:10.502
wants it to look like,
this isn't just about

24:10.504 --> 24:12.071
a maniac marine on the loose.

24:12.073 --> 24:13.739
Brossette's wife was taken.

24:13.741 --> 24:16.942
He's just trying to save
her, to save others.

24:16.944 --> 24:20.346
But if you take him now,
we may lose our only chance.

24:23.451 --> 24:27.853
Clearwater is an immigrant
neighborhood, all but ignored.

24:27.855 --> 24:30.356
That's why the
traffickers

24:30.358 --> 24:33.559
target the women there-- because
they don't think anybody cares.

24:33.561 --> 24:37.296
Trying to guilt me into this?
Is that your best pitch?

24:37.298 --> 24:39.798
So far.

24:41.535 --> 24:44.770
I just don't see how we can
walk away from this, Rita.

24:44.772 --> 24:46.272
Well, you can't walk away
from anything.

24:46.274 --> 24:47.539
That a bad thing?

24:47.541 --> 24:49.308
Was for us.

24:49.310 --> 24:51.377
Even though,

24:51.379 --> 24:54.079
I have to admit,
I always admired that about you.

24:54.081 --> 24:55.481
The fight for right.

24:55.483 --> 24:57.283
You had the fight
back then, too.

24:57.285 --> 24:59.918
- (chuckles)
- Still do, as far as I can tell.

24:59.920 --> 25:03.289
JAG, A.D.A.-- you're not
doing it for the money.

25:03.291 --> 25:06.325
(chuckles):
That's for sure.

25:08.562 --> 25:10.963
You're gonna say yes,
aren't you?

25:10.965 --> 25:12.498
I was from the beginning.

25:12.500 --> 25:14.733
I just wanted to watch you
work for it a little.

25:15.970 --> 25:17.136
12 hours,

25:17.138 --> 25:18.570
not a minute more.

25:18.572 --> 25:19.738
You got it.

25:19.740 --> 25:21.607
Thanks.

25:24.712 --> 25:25.911
(door opens)

25:25.913 --> 25:28.247
Bought us some time,
but not much.

25:28.249 --> 25:30.716
Means we got to move fast.
How bad you hurt?

25:30.718 --> 25:32.718
Don't worry about me.
What's the plan?

25:32.720 --> 25:35.788
We found a way
to contact the traffickers,

25:35.790 --> 25:38.257
but you're the only one
who can make them meet.

25:38.259 --> 25:39.858
How so?

25:39.860 --> 25:42.461
They got to know who you are,
what you've been doing.

25:42.463 --> 25:43.829
Explain to them

25:43.831 --> 25:45.631
you don't want
any trouble,

25:45.633 --> 25:47.800
you don't care
about the others.

25:47.802 --> 25:51.603
Just want to get Amelia back
and that you're willing to pay.

25:51.605 --> 25:53.405
What if they don't bite?

25:53.407 --> 25:54.573
Then you tell them
you won't stop,

25:54.575 --> 25:55.607
you'll keep coming
after them.

25:55.609 --> 25:56.742
Doubt they want publicity

25:56.744 --> 25:57.943
any more than
Mayor Hamilton does.

25:57.945 --> 25:59.178
Even if they
agree to meet,

25:59.180 --> 26:01.347
they'll try to kill me.

26:01.349 --> 26:03.816
Me and my team will be
right there backing you up.

26:03.818 --> 26:06.652
Moment we see Amelia,
we move in.

26:06.654 --> 26:08.921
You're right, though.

26:08.923 --> 26:11.290
No guarantees this'll work,
but it's all we got.

26:11.292 --> 26:13.025
It's up to you.

26:15.229 --> 26:17.496
♪ ♪

26:27.408 --> 26:28.741
Showtime.

26:28.743 --> 26:30.709
Copy that. Standing by.

26:52.333 --> 26:54.733
Brave man.

26:54.735 --> 26:56.468
You must really love your wife.

26:56.470 --> 26:58.370
Where is she?

26:58.372 --> 27:00.406
First thing first.

27:03.711 --> 27:05.944
You understand, this is
all unfortunate mistake.

27:05.946 --> 27:08.614
Your wife was never meant
to be taken.

27:10.584 --> 27:11.650
Any sign of Amelia?

27:11.652 --> 27:14.186
GREGORIO:
Can't see. Windows are tinted.

27:14.188 --> 27:15.554
Let's see the money.

27:15.556 --> 27:17.956
Not until I see my wife.

27:26.901 --> 27:28.901
It's a setup. It's a setup!
Federal agents! Freeze!

27:39.814 --> 27:40.879
(grunts)

27:46.654 --> 27:48.687
Amelia!

27:48.689 --> 27:51.390
Where's my wife?!

27:51.392 --> 27:53.492
She's not in there!

28:11.723 --> 28:13.856
The wave of violence
in the Clearwater area

28:13.858 --> 28:15.858
continued until early
this morning,

28:15.860 --> 28:18.060
leaving three dead
and one critical.

28:18.062 --> 28:20.296
But with Marine Sergeant
John Brossette

28:20.298 --> 28:21.731
finally in police custody,

28:21.733 --> 28:23.899
the mayor hopes things
can return to normal.

28:23.901 --> 28:26.302
“Return to normal.” Is
that some kind of joke?

28:26.304 --> 28:28.804
Brossette was the only one
who was keeping Clearwater

28:28.806 --> 28:30.072
from getting out of control.

28:30.074 --> 28:31.874
Yeah, and trying
to stop the traffickers.

28:31.876 --> 28:34.043
Just talked to NOPD.

28:34.045 --> 28:35.411
Brossette's at
the hospital jail ward.

28:35.413 --> 28:37.880
He lost lots of blood,
but he should be okay.

28:37.882 --> 28:39.982
Yeah, until they try him
for murder.

28:39.984 --> 28:41.150
Well, I mean, he did kill a man.

28:41.152 --> 28:42.585
Whose side are you on?

28:42.587 --> 28:43.853
I'm just saying
that if the mayor wants

28:43.855 --> 28:46.022
to pin all this on Brossette,
then he's screwed.

28:46.024 --> 28:47.723
No, King won't
let that happen.

28:47.725 --> 28:49.725
We need to focus on
getting these traffickers.

28:49.727 --> 28:51.594
Yeah, and what we
need is a lead.

28:51.596 --> 28:53.195
GREGORIO:
May have one.

28:53.197 --> 28:55.164
NOPD found port parking stubs
from three of the guys

28:55.166 --> 28:56.599
that tried to kill Brossette.

28:56.601 --> 28:58.901
Okay, the port makes sense;
that's the best way to get

28:58.903 --> 29:00.569
kidnapped women
shipped out.

29:00.571 --> 29:02.338
Right, but the question is:
are we too late?

29:02.340 --> 29:03.773
What do you got on the bad guys?

29:03.775 --> 29:07.610
Just that they're all connected
to Bulgarian organized crime.

29:07.612 --> 29:09.979
We just don't know
which networks.

29:09.981 --> 29:11.414
I got ATF working on it.

29:11.416 --> 29:13.616
GREGORIO: All right,
I'll check with FBI, too.

29:13.618 --> 29:15.217
Maybe I can identify which
syndicate we're dealing with,

29:15.219 --> 29:16.452
and then we'll make
the connections

29:16.454 --> 29:18.454
that they have at the docks.
Yeah, and hopefully

29:18.456 --> 29:20.790
we can narrow down which ship
or ships they're using.

29:20.792 --> 29:21.957
Yeah.
All right,

29:21.959 --> 29:24.160
Sebastian and I
will head down to the docks,

29:24.162 --> 29:25.728
see what we can find.

29:25.730 --> 29:27.263
Now, when King gets done
with the mayor,

29:27.265 --> 29:29.065
he's gonna want to know
if we learned things.

29:29.067 --> 29:30.466
Let's have answers.
Okay.

29:32.870 --> 29:34.637
(exhales)

29:34.639 --> 29:36.205
HAMILTON:
<i>None of this would've happened</i>

29:36.207 --> 29:37.973
<i>if you'd just simply done</i>
<i>what you were told</i>

29:37.975 --> 29:39.341
and handed Brossette over.

29:39.343 --> 29:41.077
I gave strict orders
to the D.A.

29:41.079 --> 29:43.813
Has nothing to do with the D.A.
This is my decision.

29:43.815 --> 29:45.781
Oh, y-your decision
wouldn't have anything to do

29:45.783 --> 29:47.616
with that little ex-girlfriend
of yours, would it?

29:47.618 --> 29:49.085
Rita had nothing to do with...
Oh, that's right.

29:49.087 --> 29:50.486
Yeah, I forgot she was
back in New Orleans.

29:50.488 --> 29:51.721
Yeah, I won't make that
mistake again. Don't worry.

29:51.723 --> 29:52.955
Listen to me,
Hamilton.

29:52.957 --> 29:54.824
The only thing we need to be
worried about right now

29:54.826 --> 29:56.525
is trying to save
not just Brossette's wife,

29:56.527 --> 29:58.928
but all the other women
who were taken, too.

29:58.930 --> 30:00.663
Yeah, that's my job, not yours.

30:00.665 --> 30:02.098
Which is why I'm
in the process

30:02.100 --> 30:03.599
of assembling a joint task force
right now...

30:03.601 --> 30:05.134
Damn it,
we don't have time for that!

30:05.136 --> 30:08.070
They'll be long gone by then,
if they're not already.

30:08.072 --> 30:10.339
Well, it ain't your problem
anymore, or your case, Dwayne,

30:10.341 --> 30:12.208
so drop it.

30:12.210 --> 30:13.843
Bottom line: you don't,

30:13.845 --> 30:17.646
I promise I'll have a judge
hold you in contempt

30:17.648 --> 30:20.349
for not handing Brossette over
in the first place.

30:25.022 --> 30:26.756
(door closes)

30:30.027 --> 30:31.761
Hey. Hey.

30:31.763 --> 30:34.997
I guess I don't need to ask
how it went in there.

30:34.999 --> 30:36.398
I didn't get you in trouble
with the D.A., did I?

30:36.400 --> 30:39.001
Nothing I can't handle.
Look...

30:39.003 --> 30:41.337
Don't apologize, Dwayne.
It was the right thing to do.

30:41.339 --> 30:42.738
Just because
it didn't work out...

30:42.740 --> 30:43.839
Yet. It will.

30:43.841 --> 30:46.175
Just got to
figure out how.

30:46.177 --> 30:47.743
I'm not giving up
on Brossette's wife

30:47.745 --> 30:49.245
or the traffickers.

30:49.247 --> 30:50.479
What?

30:50.481 --> 30:52.748
(chuckles):
Nothing. It's just...

30:52.750 --> 30:54.617
some things never change.

30:54.619 --> 30:56.919
I can't figure

30:56.921 --> 30:58.454
Hamilton out.

30:58.456 --> 31:01.257
Why stonewall me
on this? Right?

31:01.259 --> 31:02.758
Innocent lives
are at stake.

31:02.760 --> 31:04.927
It has nothing to do
with me or Garcia's murder.

31:04.929 --> 31:06.929
What am I missing?
I was trying to figure out

31:06.931 --> 31:08.697
the same thing,
so I did some checking.

31:08.699 --> 31:11.100
HAMILTON: Call and
tell him I'm on my way.

31:18.376 --> 31:20.976
I've got a friend
in Planning and Development

31:20.978 --> 31:23.612
who says the mayor shelved
a couple of housing projects

31:23.614 --> 31:24.914
in Clearwater.

31:24.916 --> 31:27.750
So, I got curious,
I started asking around.

31:27.752 --> 31:30.152
And apparently,
Hamilton has quietly...

31:31.556 --> 31:34.290
...has quietly derailed
every proposal there,

31:34.292 --> 31:35.691
not just a couple.

31:35.693 --> 31:38.627
So, it's not about
lack of resources.

31:38.629 --> 31:40.162
No, it's willful intent.

31:40.164 --> 31:42.131
And I don't know
why he's doing it,

31:42.133 --> 31:43.966
but obviously
there's a reason.

31:43.968 --> 31:46.035
One that he doesn't want
anybody figuring out.

31:46.037 --> 31:47.403
Well, explains
why he wants the media

31:47.405 --> 31:48.971
focusing on something else.

31:48.973 --> 31:51.640
Yeah, and why he was in
such a hurry to catch Brossette,

31:51.642 --> 31:53.442
get Clearwater out of the news.

31:53.444 --> 31:54.577
(phone beeping)

31:54.579 --> 31:56.345
Still got some fight in you.

31:57.849 --> 31:59.915
Might have something
on the traffickers. I got to go.

31:59.917 --> 32:01.450
I'll keep digging.
Okay.

32:01.452 --> 32:03.485
Rita.

32:04.488 --> 32:06.055
Watch your back.

32:06.057 --> 32:08.057
I don't trust Hamilton.

32:15.233 --> 32:17.099
Talked to a forklift operator

32:17.101 --> 32:19.902
over at the docks who saw
a ship late last night.

32:19.904 --> 32:22.471
Loaded cargo in the
dark and headed out.

32:22.473 --> 32:23.839
Get the ship's name?

32:23.841 --> 32:25.875
No, but Percy traced
the dock's lessee

32:25.877 --> 32:27.776
to a Micha Draganov.

32:27.778 --> 32:29.745
He's got ties to a
Bulgarian crime syndicate

32:29.747 --> 32:31.313
operating throughout
the South.

32:31.315 --> 32:33.616
And that links him to the men
who attacked Brossette.

32:33.618 --> 32:35.985
Yeah. Problem is, Draganov
took off in a cigarette boat

32:35.987 --> 32:37.686
over a half hour ago.

32:37.688 --> 32:39.588
Eh, doesn't like publicity.
Making a run for it.

32:39.590 --> 32:40.923
SEBASTIAN: Hey,
guys. Good news.

32:40.925 --> 32:42.958
The Coast Guard activated
the Helicopter Interdiction

32:42.960 --> 32:45.361
Tactical Squadron,
and they spotted the boat.

32:45.363 --> 32:48.264
Captain Larrabee, this is
Special Agent Pride, NCIS.

32:48.266 --> 32:50.833
Nice to meet you. HITRON
fired warning shots,

32:50.835 --> 32:52.701
stopped your suspect's boat,
but not before

32:52.703 --> 32:54.403
he made it
to international waters.

32:54.405 --> 32:56.972
Yeah, and since Draganov's boat
has a Bulgarian registration,

32:56.974 --> 32:59.208
we need permission
before we can even board.

32:59.210 --> 33:00.276
LASALLE: What are you saying?
We got to wait?

33:00.278 --> 33:01.377
No, we're not waiting.

33:01.379 --> 33:02.711
Every minute that passes,

33:02.713 --> 33:05.147
that cargo ship
gets farther away.

33:05.149 --> 33:07.316
Sebastian, you stay here,

33:07.318 --> 33:08.584
work with Sonja

33:08.586 --> 33:09.785
and Gregorio.

33:09.787 --> 33:11.053
Find that ship.

33:11.055 --> 33:12.221
You got it.

33:12.223 --> 33:13.923
Let's go!

33:13.925 --> 33:15.357
(engine revving)

33:25.202 --> 33:27.603
(indistinct radio chatter)

33:27.605 --> 33:30.072
(ship horn blows)

33:30.074 --> 33:32.274
(siren wailing)

33:32.276 --> 33:34.376
MAN (over speakers):
This is the U.S. Coast Guard.

33:34.378 --> 33:36.312
Keep your engine secured.

33:36.314 --> 33:37.880
We're coming alongside.

33:37.882 --> 33:39.815
(siren continues wailing)

33:46.123 --> 33:48.791
(siren stops)

33:48.793 --> 33:51.060
PRIDE:
Micha Draganov.

33:51.062 --> 33:52.928
Federal agents. We need to talk.

33:52.930 --> 33:55.164
Yeah? About what?

33:55.166 --> 33:57.900
About your involvement
in human trafficking.

33:57.902 --> 34:00.302
Hands on your head.
Turn around slow.

34:04.608 --> 34:05.808
(gun clicks)

34:18.222 --> 34:19.922
It's clear.

34:19.924 --> 34:21.489
PRIDE: Make it
easier on yourself

34:21.492 --> 34:22.925
if you just gave us the name

34:22.927 --> 34:24.726
and destination
of the cargo ship

34:24.728 --> 34:27.963
that left port last night with
the kidnapped women on board.

34:27.965 --> 34:29.998
No idea
what you're talking about.

34:30.001 --> 34:31.632
Besides,

34:31.635 --> 34:34.303
we are in international waters.

34:34.304 --> 34:36.638
I doubt my government
gave you authority.

34:50.821 --> 34:53.722
Wave off the Coast Guard.

34:59.030 --> 35:01.363
All right, we'll take it
from here, fellas.

35:01.365 --> 35:03.799
Thank you. Call
off the helo, too.

35:18.182 --> 35:19.848
What do you think you're doing?

35:20.718 --> 35:23.252
Looking to motivate you.

35:28.192 --> 35:29.658
(engine revving)

35:31.429 --> 35:32.995
(gasps)

35:32.997 --> 35:34.096
Hey!

35:34.098 --> 35:35.397
Come back here!

35:35.399 --> 35:38.100
Hey! Hey!

35:38.102 --> 35:40.702
Hey! Come back here!

35:40.704 --> 35:42.871
Hey!

35:46.744 --> 35:49.244
You do know there are sharks
in the Gulf.

35:49.246 --> 35:51.947
Fully aware.

36:06.521 --> 36:08.821
Hey!

36:08.823 --> 36:11.657
Come back here!

36:12.728 --> 36:14.261
No disrespect, King,

36:14.263 --> 36:17.664
but you sure you know
what you're doing?

36:17.666 --> 36:20.500
We don't have time to make him
tell us where the ship's headed.

36:20.502 --> 36:22.669
I understand, but you know

36:22.671 --> 36:25.072
that coercion
doesn't hold up in court.

36:25.074 --> 36:26.673
Not worried about court.

36:26.675 --> 36:28.742
Just finding Amelia
and the others.

36:28.744 --> 36:30.644
All right.

36:30.646 --> 36:33.580
Well, how's letting him
drown accomplish that?

36:34.683 --> 36:36.783
You think I'm gonna
let him drown?

36:36.785 --> 36:39.786
Thought did cross my mind.

36:41.090 --> 36:42.823
Well, good.

36:42.825 --> 36:45.225
Means it's crossed
his mind, too. Hold on.

36:45.227 --> 36:47.994
(engine revving)

36:55.738 --> 36:58.105
Hey!

36:59.608 --> 37:00.574
Hey!

37:00.576 --> 37:03.977
(Draganov gasping)

37:03.979 --> 37:05.979
Let's try this again.

37:05.981 --> 37:08.115
Ship name and destination.

37:11.053 --> 37:13.754
It's the <i>Nikolina.</i>

37:13.756 --> 37:15.622
Headed for Aruba.

37:15.624 --> 37:17.257
Aruba.

37:17.259 --> 37:18.492
(coughing)

37:18.494 --> 37:20.293
Just that easy.

37:21.663 --> 37:23.363
(coughing)

37:27.936 --> 37:31.138
(doors creaking)

37:31.140 --> 37:33.340
(women crying, whimpering)

37:35.511 --> 37:38.278
U.S. Coast Guard. It's okay.

37:38.280 --> 37:40.647
You're safe now.
<i>Estás seguro.</i>

37:40.649 --> 37:42.449
Come on.

37:42.451 --> 37:44.217
Come on, ladies.

37:44.219 --> 37:46.620
<i>Está bien. Estás seguro.</i>

37:51.493 --> 37:52.826
Okay.

37:52.828 --> 37:55.529
You're safe.

37:55.531 --> 37:56.997
Are you Mrs. Brossette?

37:56.999 --> 37:58.799
Amelia?

37:58.801 --> 38:00.267
Yes.

38:00.269 --> 38:02.702
Your husband's gonna be
very happy to see you.

38:02.704 --> 38:04.871
(sobbing softly)

38:07.443 --> 38:09.709
♪ ♪

38:20.789 --> 38:22.389
No, Pride did not
toss him overboard.

38:22.391 --> 38:23.490
Oh, yes, he did.

38:23.492 --> 38:25.392
He didn't even hesitate, either.
Ah.

38:25.394 --> 38:27.194
You should've seen the look
on Draganov's face.

38:27.196 --> 38:29.062
I am so not at
the FBI anymore.

38:29.064 --> 38:30.530
So what did <i>you</i> do?

38:30.532 --> 38:31.965
Well, I really didn't
know what to do.

38:31.967 --> 38:33.834
I was just kind of
going along with the flow.

38:33.836 --> 38:35.602
It worked well, though,
didn't it?

38:35.604 --> 38:37.604
Yeah, I'll say.
We took down

38:37.606 --> 38:38.905
a slave trafficking ring,

38:38.907 --> 38:41.107
we saved Brossette's wife,
busted the ringleader.

38:41.109 --> 38:43.376
Not bad, considering
how it all went down.

38:43.378 --> 38:44.644
Think there'll be any blowback?

38:44.646 --> 38:46.246
SONJA: (scoffs)
I don't think so.

38:46.248 --> 38:49.282
Draganov confessed;
it doesn't matter why.

38:49.284 --> 38:50.984
No one would believe him anyway.

38:50.986 --> 38:52.118
What about Sergeant Brossette?

38:52.120 --> 38:53.887
You think the fact that
he was right all along

38:53.889 --> 38:55.021
will help him out?

38:55.023 --> 38:56.189
I think Pride's talking to Rita

38:56.191 --> 38:57.624
about that very subject
as we speak.

38:57.626 --> 39:00.160
Oh, any excuse to talk to Rita.

39:00.162 --> 39:01.795
Oh, here we go.
Profiler at work again.

39:01.797 --> 39:04.598
Doesn't take a profiler to
see the obvious, knucklehead.

39:04.600 --> 39:06.233
Mm-mm. Neanderthal.

39:06.235 --> 39:08.001
Ah. That's a better word.

39:08.003 --> 39:09.703
Whoa. That's a sick burn.
See what I have to put up with?

39:09.705 --> 39:11.071
SEBASTIAN:
They got you.

39:11.073 --> 39:13.773
(laughter)

39:13.775 --> 39:15.976
(romantic jazz music playing)

39:19.715 --> 39:22.682
If I remember right,
you used to like it spicy.

39:22.684 --> 39:24.885
You still do?

39:24.887 --> 39:28.121
I... don't know.
(laughs)

39:28.123 --> 39:30.957
Uh, it's been a while
since I've had shrimp Creole.

39:30.959 --> 39:32.926
What the hell.

39:32.928 --> 39:34.895
Ah. Attagirl.

39:34.897 --> 39:37.230
By the way, if you think
you're gonna butter me up

39:37.232 --> 39:39.733
by wining and dining me,
it's not gonna work.

39:39.735 --> 39:41.635
I don't know what
you're talking about.

39:41.637 --> 39:43.136
Liar.

39:43.138 --> 39:45.739
Sergeant Brossette's
still in a lot of trouble.

39:47.609 --> 39:48.808
Understood.

39:48.810 --> 39:50.277
Mmm.

39:50.279 --> 39:51.478
Mm-hmm.

39:51.480 --> 39:53.413
Mmm.

39:53.415 --> 39:56.616
He broke into two places,
hurt a lot of people.

39:56.618 --> 39:57.784
A lot of bad people.

39:57.786 --> 39:59.986
Killed one.

39:59.988 --> 40:02.389
Self-defense. Man
shot him from behind.

40:02.391 --> 40:05.492
Plus, if he hadn't,
the trafficking ring...

40:05.494 --> 40:08.828
Means justifies the end?
Is that how you see it, Dwayne?

40:08.830 --> 40:11.231
Like I said,

40:11.233 --> 40:12.465
some things don't change.

40:12.467 --> 40:14.434
Hmm.

40:14.436 --> 40:19.673
I should be able
to get his charges reduced.

40:19.675 --> 40:21.775
Thank you.

40:23.312 --> 40:24.544
You hungry?

40:24.546 --> 40:26.313
Starving.

40:26.315 --> 40:27.814
(clears throat)

40:27.816 --> 40:30.050
I am worried about you, though.
How so?

40:30.052 --> 40:33.720
Well, you said that you
think Mayor Hamilton

40:33.722 --> 40:36.890
had something to do with
Javier Garcia's murder.

40:36.892 --> 40:38.258
I know that he did.

40:38.260 --> 40:39.893
Just have to find
a way to prove it.

40:39.895 --> 40:40.927
Well, and then what?

40:40.929 --> 40:42.128
You go after him,

40:42.130 --> 40:43.797
or try to take him down?
Is that it?

40:43.799 --> 40:46.733
I'm gonna do
what I have to do, Rita.

40:47.970 --> 40:50.870
Mayor's corrupt.
Known it for a long time.

40:50.872 --> 40:53.073
With whatever
Garcia had on him,

40:53.075 --> 40:56.209
whatever he's doing
with Clearwater,

40:56.211 --> 40:57.911
it's different now.

40:57.913 --> 40:59.980
And you think you can stop him?

40:59.982 --> 41:01.948
Somebody has to.

41:01.950 --> 41:04.618
The mayor's not under
NCIS's jurisdiction, Dwayne.

41:04.620 --> 41:07.654
And the end doesn't
always justify the means,

41:07.656 --> 41:10.523
especially if it ends up
getting you killed.

41:10.525 --> 41:13.493
That's not gonna happen.

41:51.189 --> 41:51.766
No.

42:17.225 --> 42:18.858
That was a drink
after work.

42:18.860 --> 42:21.394
This is dancing.
We're gonna have fun.

42:21.396 --> 42:22.042

- Yeah.

Just give me
a chance to explain.

Preferably without a gun
pointed at my chest.

43:40.375 --> 43:43.042
An FBI agent?
I did not see that one coming.

I got to admit, you're
really sexy with that gun.

43:53.221 --> 43:54.954
Terrifying, but sexy.

43:54.956 --> 43:56.389
Okay, it's been peachy
catching up,

43:56.391 --> 43:57.857
but I'm gonna call
the cops now.

Wait, hold on a second.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

44:00.095 --> 44:02.161

44:02.163 --> 44:04.330
Look, just give me
two minutes to explain.

44:04.332 --> 44:06.332
And if you still feel it,
you can shoot me.

44:08.403 --> 44:09.802
The Aufieros want me dead.

44:09.804 --> 44:12.338
You stole $80 million
from the FEMA funds

44:12.340 --> 44:14.807
that were for New Orleans
after Katrina.

44:14.809 --> 44:17.610
The whole city wants
you dead, including me.

44:17.612 --> 44:20.146
Look, there might have been
a little bit of embezzlement...

44:20.148 --> 44:22.715
Followed by ten years
of you living high on the hog

44:22.717 --> 44:24.450
in a tropical paradise.

44:24.452 --> 44:28.154
Des Moines is many things.
Paradise is is not.

44:28.156 --> 44:31.291
Des Moines, Iowa?

44:31.293 --> 44:35.528
Ten years ago, Joe Aufiero
forced me to steal that money.

44:35.530 --> 44:37.030
He said he'd kill me
if I didn't.

44:37.032 --> 44:38.831
And you, too,
for that matter.

44:38.833 --> 44:40.266
So I did the only
thing I could...

44:40.268 --> 44:41.501
became an informant
for the FBI

44:41.503 --> 44:42.802
to help take Joe down.

44:42.804 --> 44:43.387
Bull.

44:43.411 --> 44:45.205
It all happened right
after you left me.

44:45.206 --> 44:46.906
I gave the Feds
everything I had,

44:46.908 --> 44:48.374
and they put me in WITSEC--
I couldn't tell anybody.

44:48.376 --> 44:50.476
I can make one call
to the FBI right now

44:50.478 --> 44:52.712
and verify your story.
Do it.

44:52.714 --> 44:55.014
If you were in WITSEC,

44:55.016 --> 44:57.250
why would you come back
to New Orleans?

44:57.252 --> 45:00.086
There's a target the size
of Louisiana on you right now.

45:00.088 --> 45:02.121
The Aufieros figured
out where I was.

45:02.123 --> 45:03.723
Sent someone to kill me.

45:03.725 --> 45:05.825
I'm a marked man.

45:05.827 --> 45:09.228
And you are the only person
I can trust.

45:11.800 --> 45:14.067
(knock on door)
SONJA: Hey, Gregorio, bath time's over.

45:14.069 --> 45:15.635
We caught a case.

45:15.637 --> 45:17.637
I'll be right there, Percy.

45:17.639 --> 45:20.006
Shh, shh, shh.

45:20.008 --> 45:22.408
What are you doing?
Shut up.

45:22.410 --> 45:25.979
Securing a fugitive
until I verify your story.

45:25.981 --> 45:29.415
Then I'll throw you
to the wolves.

45:29.417 --> 45:31.651
Last time we did this,
(knock on door) way more fun.

45:31.653 --> 45:33.119
SONJA: Let's go, Gregorio.
Be quiet.

45:33.121 --> 45:34.687
Don't move.

45:36.524 --> 45:38.624
Coming.

45:41.363 --> 45:43.963
SONJA: About time.
Sorry.

45:51.239 --> 45:53.539
Hello, ladies.
So much for a night off.

45:53.541 --> 45:55.708
SONJA: Ho, no rest
for the wicked.

45:55.710 --> 45:58.044
Are there more NOPD
here than usual?

45:58.046 --> 45:59.445
Yeah, well, we wanted
extra manpower

45:59.447 --> 46:00.713
to protect the crime scene,

46:00.715 --> 46:02.715
considering who
the victim is.

46:04.419 --> 46:07.520
Alex Aufiero.
Joe's youngest son.

46:07.522 --> 46:10.123
As in the Aufiero
crime family?

46:10.125 --> 46:12.158
You know this kid,
Gregorio?

46:12.160 --> 46:13.926
What do we know?

46:13.928 --> 46:15.828
I'd know more
if Forensic Agent Lund

46:15.830 --> 46:17.363
would give me a little room.

46:17.365 --> 46:19.298
I'm sorry, there's
just this substance

46:19.300 --> 46:21.300
on the victim's jacket--
it's fascinating.

46:21.302 --> 46:23.503
Well, you'll get your chance.
First things first.

46:23.505 --> 46:26.639
Lieutenant Aufiero,
he was shot three times,

46:26.641 --> 46:28.474
point-blank range in the chest.

46:28.476 --> 46:30.443
Bled out before
EMTs could arrive.

46:30.445 --> 46:32.845
Can I... can I go now?
Yes.

46:32.847 --> 46:35.515
I think that the killer left
this trace evidence behind.

46:35.517 --> 46:37.183
SONJA: We talking
fingerprints, biologicals?

46:37.185 --> 46:39.285
Right now I'd classify it
as schmutz,

46:39.287 --> 46:40.586
but I'm gonna
bring it back to the lab

46:40.588 --> 46:41.788
and get a more
detailed explanation.

46:41.790 --> 46:42.789
Witnesses?

46:42.791 --> 46:44.424
Gas station attendant

46:44.426 --> 46:46.826
came right out that door
after the shots were fired,

46:46.828 --> 46:51.664
and filmed a man fleeing
the scene in Alex's car.

46:53.334 --> 46:55.868
Oh, no.

46:55.870 --> 46:59.072
Well, it's sad, right?
Young kid.

46:59.074 --> 47:01.674
Could be our shooter

47:01.676 --> 47:03.776
that used Alex's car
to get away.

47:03.778 --> 47:05.278
I'll put a BOLO out.

47:05.280 --> 47:08.881
So last year, Joe Aufiero
died in prison.

47:08.883 --> 47:11.517
But his family's still
active in organized crime.

47:11.519 --> 47:13.486
We don't need another
gang war on our hands.

47:13.488 --> 47:15.888
Alex joined the navy
after his father was convicted,

47:15.890 --> 47:18.024
became a war hero.

47:18.026 --> 47:20.693
Wanted nothing to do
with the family business.

47:20.695 --> 47:22.328
Why do you know
so much about him?

47:22.330 --> 47:24.397
Because my ex-husband
worked with the Aufieros.

47:24.399 --> 47:26.232
Took Alex under his wing.

47:26.234 --> 47:28.334
I don't know what
was harder for him,

47:28.336 --> 47:30.970
his father's guilt
or McKinley's disappearance.

47:30.972 --> 47:33.873
Well, it wasn't easy
for either one of you.

47:33.875 --> 47:36.042
Look, bottom line,
this kid had nothing to do

47:36.044 --> 47:37.510
with organized crime.

47:37.512 --> 47:39.045
Well, it doesn't mean
he wasn't targeted

47:39.047 --> 47:41.080
to send a message
to his family.

47:41.082 --> 47:42.682
All right, I'll check
with the FBI,

47:42.684 --> 47:45.551
see if they have any
Intel on the Aufieros

47:45.553 --> 47:47.987
Be right back. Hey.

47:50.058 --> 47:52.091
You okay?

47:52.093 --> 47:53.759
Never better.

47:53.761 --> 47:55.628
You knew the
victim personally?

47:55.630 --> 47:57.130
All the more reason
to get cracking

47:57.132 --> 47:59.332
on finding out who did this.

47:59.334 --> 48:01.300
GREGORIO:
Don't worry about me.

48:16.751 --> 48:19.252
You've got to be kidding me.

48:25.627 --> 48:29.362
Picked the lock?
Is that a new skill?

48:29.364 --> 48:31.130
A man's got to grow.

48:31.132 --> 48:32.632
Food just arrived.

48:32.634 --> 48:34.200
I have been dreaming
about this spread.

48:34.202 --> 48:37.103
You know how pissed
off I am right now?

48:37.105 --> 48:38.988
Have a glass of Brézé.
Make you feel better.

48:38.989 --> 48:40.279
Same one from our
fifth anniversary.

48:40.303 --> 48:41.675
Alex Aufiero was murdered.

48:41.676 --> 48:43.476
But you know that since
you fled the crime scene

48:43.478 --> 48:44.911
in his car.

48:44.913 --> 48:46.145
I was gonna tell you

48:46.147 --> 48:48.281
right before your friend
interrupted us.

48:48.283 --> 48:50.650
My <i>friend,</i> the NCIS agent,
who was coming to take me

48:50.652 --> 48:52.985
to investigate the homicide
you're involved in!

48:52.987 --> 48:54.754
Alex was a good kid.
I didn't kill him.

48:54.756 --> 48:56.956
Every cop in the city
is after you right now.

48:56.958 --> 48:58.124
No more lies, Ethan.

48:58.126 --> 49:00.660
I haven't lied.
Call the FBI.

49:00.662 --> 49:01.928
They'll tell you
I was in WITSEC,

49:01.930 --> 49:03.129
and that someone tried
to attack me.

49:03.131 --> 49:05.631
I called,
and they confirmed it.

49:05.633 --> 49:08.034
So, see?
I'm in danger.

49:08.036 --> 49:09.735
Okay, and you thought
it was a good idea

49:09.737 --> 49:11.604
to escape my hotel room and
come here and have dinner

49:11.606 --> 49:13.372
in the middle of a restaurant?

49:13.374 --> 49:15.808
Nobody's gonna shoot me here.
And I was hungry.

49:15.810 --> 49:17.743
Oh...
Besides, I left a note.

49:17.745 --> 49:19.145
It's not like
I'm a flight risk.

49:19.147 --> 49:20.880
You are the definition
of a flight risk,

49:20.882 --> 49:22.481
and maybe a murderer.

49:22.483 --> 49:24.317
Come on, baby, let me explain.

49:24.319 --> 49:26.052
Do not “baby” me.

49:26.054 --> 49:27.920
You have 30 seconds.
You better start talking.

49:27.922 --> 49:29.822
I've never explained anything
in 30 seconds.

49:29.824 --> 49:31.657
25 seconds.

49:31.659 --> 49:34.360
T, relax. We've got plenty
of time to sort this out.

49:34.362 --> 49:36.395
Don't tell me to relax.
LASALLE: Ethan McKinley.

49:36.397 --> 49:39.398
NCIS.
Get your hands up.

49:40.268 --> 49:41.934
Gregorio?

49:43.905 --> 49:47.039
Oh, this just got awkward.

49:59.151 --> 50:00.817
GREGORIO: Wait, guys,
I know this looks bad.

50:00.819 --> 50:04.054
You were having a bottle of wine
with a wanted fugitive,

50:04.056 --> 50:05.655
who happens to be
your ex-husband.

50:05.657 --> 50:07.090
So, yeah, it
doesn't look good.

50:07.092 --> 50:08.125
Chris, let her talk.

50:08.127 --> 50:09.559
What more do we
need to know?

50:09.561 --> 50:11.795
All right, this bastard
stole $80 million

50:11.797 --> 50:14.164
from New Orleans,
and is the prime suspect

50:14.166 --> 50:15.665
in Alex Aufiero's murder.

50:15.667 --> 50:16.833
“Bastard's” a strong word.

50:16.835 --> 50:18.001
He said he didn't
kill Alex.

50:18.003 --> 50:19.102
We tracked Alex's
stolen car

50:19.104 --> 50:20.437
to around the corner.

50:20.439 --> 50:21.671
McKinley's fingerprints
were all over it.

50:21.673 --> 50:22.906
Not my smartest move.

50:22.908 --> 50:24.341
Look, I'm the first one
that wants

50:24.343 --> 50:25.809
to see him locked up, okay?

50:25.811 --> 50:26.843
I was gonna arrest him.

50:26.845 --> 50:27.844
Why didn't you?

50:27.846 --> 50:30.313
Look, he may be a bastard,

50:30.315 --> 50:32.849
but he's an FBI informant
whose life is in danger.

50:32.851 --> 50:35.152
He's the reason
Joe Aufiero's in prison.

50:35.154 --> 50:37.621
Someone took a shot at him
while he was in WITSEC.

50:37.623 --> 50:39.289
Multiple shots,
actually.

50:39.291 --> 50:41.758
I would describe it
as a hail of bullets.

50:41.760 --> 50:43.527
None of what
you just said

50:43.529 --> 50:45.095
clears him of Alex's murder.

50:45.097 --> 50:47.464
I was trying to get
the full story, Percy.

50:47.466 --> 50:51.101
Look, I got your back,
but Pride...

50:51.103 --> 50:54.171
he's gonna want
a better explanation.

50:54.173 --> 50:57.207
PRIDE: <i>Don't know whether</i>
<i>to be furious with you</i>

50:57.209 --> 50:58.608
or worried.

50:58.610 --> 51:00.477
You knew McKinley was
in New Orleans,

51:00.479 --> 51:01.912
connected to Alex's murder,

51:01.914 --> 51:04.047
but you said nothing.
He's my ex-husband.

51:04.049 --> 51:05.582
He claims his life
was in danger.

51:05.584 --> 51:07.117
I was just trying
to sort it out.

51:07.119 --> 51:09.085
Alone?
Without your team?

51:09.087 --> 51:10.587
Trust works both ways.

51:10.589 --> 51:11.888
Okay, it was a bad
judgment call.

51:11.890 --> 51:13.323
Yes, it was.

51:13.325 --> 51:14.724
And you need to take
a step back.

51:14.726 --> 51:16.026
Let the rest of us
handle the case.

51:16.028 --> 51:17.527
Whoa, I grew up
with this guy.

51:17.529 --> 51:18.662
I know him better than anyone.

51:18.664 --> 51:20.797
And he knows you.

51:20.799 --> 51:22.732
Ethan McKinley
can't be trusted.

51:22.734 --> 51:24.234
He'll take advantage
of every angle

51:24.236 --> 51:26.736
to get out of this mess,
especially his ex-wife.

51:26.738 --> 51:28.238
You're not gonna let me
be a part of this case?

51:28.240 --> 51:30.407
Haven't decided yet.
Take five.

51:30.409 --> 51:33.076
Get your head on straight.

51:35.380 --> 51:37.781
I'll talk to
the man of the hour.

51:42.020 --> 51:43.820
Oh, good, the
boss is here.

51:43.822 --> 51:45.322
I was wondering if we could
get something to snack on.

51:45.324 --> 51:46.823
You guys interrupted
my dinner.

51:46.825 --> 51:50.327
Ten years ago,
New Orleans was on its knees,

51:50.329 --> 51:52.095
devastated.

51:52.097 --> 51:54.698
A lot of good people
worked hard to bring it back.

51:54.700 --> 51:57.067
You took advantage of them.

51:57.069 --> 51:59.269
Used them to make a profit.

51:59.271 --> 52:01.571
You're angry.

52:01.573 --> 52:03.673
I understand. I was used, too.

52:03.675 --> 52:04.908
If you talk to T...

52:04.910 --> 52:05.876
We did.

52:05.878 --> 52:07.277
Well, then, she told you.

52:07.279 --> 52:08.578
I'm one of the good guys.

52:08.580 --> 52:10.614
Just because you informed
on Joe Aufiero

52:10.616 --> 52:11.882
doesn't mean you're good.

52:11.884 --> 52:13.116
It means you got caught.

52:13.118 --> 52:16.553
Cooperating with the FBI
was an act of self-preservation,

52:16.555 --> 52:18.021
not altruism.

52:18.023 --> 52:20.557
You're a thief and a parasite.

52:20.559 --> 52:22.359
Wow.

52:22.361 --> 52:23.760
Tough room.

52:23.762 --> 52:25.962
This is us being nice.

52:25.964 --> 52:27.664
You don't want to see tough.

52:28.567 --> 52:30.133
Look...

52:30.135 --> 52:31.601
I am flawed.

52:31.603 --> 52:33.870
I have made some huge mistakes.

52:33.872 --> 52:36.439
But I spent ten years
flipping burgers in a diner

52:36.441 --> 52:39.643
after helping take down the most
dangerous man in New Orleans.

52:39.645 --> 52:42.045
That should buy me
some consideration.

52:42.047 --> 52:43.713
Alex Aufiero

52:43.715 --> 52:45.315
was murdered tonight.

52:45.317 --> 52:47.884
You were with him.
And fled the scene.

52:47.886 --> 52:50.120
Which makes you
our prime suspect.

52:50.122 --> 52:51.488
I had to run.

52:51.490 --> 52:53.390
If I hadn't, I would
have been dead, too.

52:53.392 --> 52:55.492
Alex saved my life.

52:55.494 --> 52:58.328
That bullet that killed him
was meant for me.

52:59.798 --> 53:01.965
You can spin anything.

53:01.967 --> 53:03.600
It's not spin.

53:03.602 --> 53:05.936
All right, I went to Alex
tonight out of desperation.

53:05.938 --> 53:07.470
His brothers have a vendetta
against me.

53:07.472 --> 53:08.705
They already tried

53:08.707 --> 53:10.240
to kill me once.

53:10.242 --> 53:12.642
I was hoping Alex could reason
with them, but...

53:13.879 --> 53:16.279
(sighs)
...he never got the chance.

53:16.281 --> 53:19.316
After everything you've done
in your life,

53:19.318 --> 53:21.351
why should we believe you?

53:22.554 --> 53:25.121
Because I can identify
Alex's killer.

53:27.225 --> 53:29.793
GREGORIO: <i>I was just a child</i>
<i>when I met Ethan.</i>

53:30.896 --> 53:32.929
He took care of me.
You know, he was--

53:32.931 --> 53:34.864
my everything.

53:34.866 --> 53:37.467
I even believed his lies.
(scoffs)

53:37.469 --> 53:39.402
Been there.

53:39.404 --> 53:40.804
And then, I learned

53:40.806 --> 53:43.540
he was conning people
our whole marriage.

53:43.542 --> 53:44.741
He embezzled

53:44.743 --> 53:46.843
that FEMA money
right under my nose.

53:46.845 --> 53:48.378
And that's when I left him.

53:48.380 --> 53:50.714
And I decided
I'd never let anyone

53:50.716 --> 53:53.350
deceive me the way he did
ever again.

53:53.352 --> 53:57.487
And so, you joined the FBI to
put people like him away. Right?

53:57.489 --> 53:59.322
And everything I've done
in the last ten years

53:59.324 --> 54:02.058
has been motivated
by that man's betrayal.

54:02.060 --> 54:04.160
Yet here I am again.

54:04.162 --> 54:05.362
No.

54:05.364 --> 54:07.230
No, now this time,

54:07.232 --> 54:09.165
you get to confront your demon.

54:09.167 --> 54:11.668
Beat him down
once and for all.

54:11.670 --> 54:13.436
Finally move on.

54:15.307 --> 54:17.073
I hope so.

54:17.075 --> 54:19.376
We got something, ladies.

54:19.378 --> 54:21.945
Got to start somewhere.

54:23.749 --> 54:25.682
SONJA:
Okay, who are we looking at?

54:25.684 --> 54:27.150
Vincenzo Moretti.

54:27.152 --> 54:29.219
It's the button man
for the Aufiero family

54:29.221 --> 54:30.520
from way back.

54:30.522 --> 54:33.423
He's connected to a dozen
or so contract murders.

54:33.425 --> 54:35.558
Including
Alex Aufiero's.

54:35.560 --> 54:37.527
At least,
according to McKinley.

54:37.529 --> 54:39.896
Why would the Aufieros put
a hit out on one of their own?

54:39.898 --> 54:42.032
Well, McKinley claims
he was the target.

54:42.034 --> 54:43.933
Retribution for informing.

54:43.935 --> 54:46.436
Alex played the hero,
took a bullet to save him.

54:46.438 --> 54:48.505
Question is, do we believe him?

54:48.507 --> 54:50.306
Well, Alex got a Silver Star
for doing the same thing.

54:50.308 --> 54:53.276
If Ethan identified Vincenzo,
you can bet he has an angle.

54:53.278 --> 54:54.611
Yeah, self-preservation.

54:54.613 --> 54:55.879
SONJA:
Well, there's a warrant out

54:55.881 --> 54:57.747
for Vincenzo's arrest
for two years.

54:57.749 --> 54:59.049
The cops can't find him.

54:59.051 --> 55:00.417
Well, that's convenient.

55:00.419 --> 55:02.552
The suspect McKinley feeds us
is hard to find.

55:02.554 --> 55:04.788
Well, the best con men
always stick to the truth,

55:04.790 --> 55:06.489
except for one detail.

55:06.491 --> 55:08.458
Just got to figure out
what that detail is.

55:08.460 --> 55:12.896
We find Vincenzo Moretti,
we figure it out.

55:12.898 --> 55:14.097
Oh, looks like
someone's

55:14.099 --> 55:15.198
enjoying their night.

55:15.200 --> 55:16.966
What? Oh, the rum.

55:16.968 --> 55:18.701
Uh, that's, uh,
that's not for drinking.

55:18.703 --> 55:20.270
It's for analysis.

55:20.272 --> 55:22.038
You guys remember that schmutz
that I found on the victim

55:22.040 --> 55:23.907
at the crime scene?
Well, I was able to get

55:23.909 --> 55:25.108
a little bit more specific,

55:25.110 --> 55:27.410
and I found molasses,
caramel and coconut.

55:27.412 --> 55:28.878
Yeah, we get it. It's rum.

55:28.880 --> 55:30.113
Well, it's not just any rum.

55:30.115 --> 55:31.481
It's a special proprietary blend

55:31.483 --> 55:32.882
called Vieux Carré Gold.

55:32.884 --> 55:34.884
And it is distilled

55:34.886 --> 55:37.287
by Old New Orleans
Louisiana Rum.

55:37.289 --> 55:39.522
Distillery was shut down
over a year ago.

55:39.524 --> 55:41.091
It's been abandoned ever since.

55:41.093 --> 55:43.293
Great hideout for
a wanted killer.

55:43.295 --> 55:46.129
Sebastian, get Patton.
Let's find out.

55:58.009 --> 56:00.443
PRIDE:
Open comms, everyone.

56:00.445 --> 56:01.945
We're moving.

56:09.955 --> 56:11.454
Got eyes on the front
of the building.

56:11.456 --> 56:12.856
No vantage to see inside.

56:12.858 --> 56:15.091
Yeah, same here, King.

56:15.093 --> 56:17.093
There's multiple doors,
but only one looks viable.

56:17.095 --> 56:19.195
Yeah, and Vincenzo's
a wanted fugitive.

56:19.197 --> 56:21.030
If he's in there,
he won't come easily.

56:21.032 --> 56:23.566
We need to take him alive
to confirm McKinley's story.

56:23.568 --> 56:26.436
We breach the building, we may
be walking into an ambush.

56:26.438 --> 56:27.704
Yeah, might need backup.

56:27.706 --> 56:28.938
Should we wait for NOPD?

56:28.940 --> 56:30.106
PATTON:
Backup's already here, baby.

56:30.108 --> 56:31.374
What are you talking about,
Patton?

56:31.376 --> 56:32.742
PATTON: <i>You need eyes</i>
<i>in an abandoned building</i>

56:32.744 --> 56:33.776
<i>with no cameras.</i>

56:33.778 --> 56:35.378
That's why Triple P
is on the case.

56:35.380 --> 56:37.347
Yo, dude, you're stepping
on my pitch, man.

56:38.216 --> 56:39.883
PRIDE:
Well, let's get to it.

56:39.885 --> 56:41.217
I got to go.

56:41.219 --> 56:42.218
(van door opens)

56:42.220 --> 56:43.486
SEBASTIAN:
Pride?

56:45.123 --> 56:46.856
Thermal camera sends images

56:46.858 --> 56:48.224
back to Patton in the van.

56:48.226 --> 56:50.460
He'll be able to tell us
if Vincenzo's inside.

56:50.462 --> 56:52.095
PRIDE:
You see anything, Patton?

56:52.097 --> 56:54.063
Nope. Nothing,
but empty space so far.

56:54.065 --> 56:56.799
Wait a minute,
I think I got your target.

56:56.801 --> 56:58.034
How do you know it's him?

56:58.036 --> 56:59.736
There's a glowing
blue area on his hip.

56:59.738 --> 57:01.838
That would be a gun.

57:01.840 --> 57:04.741
Vincenzo's in a storage room
along the riverside wall.

57:04.743 --> 57:06.709
All right, Chris, Sonja,

57:06.711 --> 57:08.178
come in through the back.

57:08.180 --> 57:09.879
Flush him out to me
and Gregorio in the front.

57:09.881 --> 57:11.347
LASALLE:
You got it.

57:16.321 --> 57:17.720
What about me?

57:17.722 --> 57:19.556
You keep monitoring
their movements.

57:19.558 --> 57:21.090
You're our eyes, Sebastian.

57:22.961 --> 57:24.794
All right, Patton,
we're in position.

57:24.796 --> 57:27.163
Give us the exact location
of the suspect.

57:27.165 --> 57:28.598
PATTON: He's left
the storage room.

57:28.600 --> 57:29.732
You should have eyes on him.

57:29.734 --> 57:30.867
LASALLE:
I got him.

57:30.869 --> 57:31.734
NCIS, get your hands up!

57:31.736 --> 57:33.469
SONJA:
Suspect's fled!

57:35.707 --> 57:37.307
Patton, can you see him?

57:37.309 --> 57:39.442
He's moving north
towards the front exit.

57:39.444 --> 57:41.110
In pursuit.

57:44.783 --> 57:46.716
He's running up the stairs.

57:55.961 --> 57:57.427
(gunshots)

57:57.429 --> 57:58.429
Drop the gun now!

58:00.432 --> 58:01.497
(body thuds on floor)

58:13.478 --> 58:15.645
You okay?

58:16.481 --> 58:18.448
So much for taking him alive.

58:35.882 --> 58:37.648
I just ran initial ballistics.

58:37.650 --> 58:40.585
Vincenzo's gun matches the one
used to shoot Alex Aufiero.

58:40.587 --> 58:44.221
Confirms McKinley's story that
Vincenzo's our murderer.

58:44.223 --> 58:45.456
Still doesn't tell us why.

58:45.458 --> 58:47.858
McKinley claims
he was Vincenzo's target.

58:47.860 --> 58:50.194
Alex took a bullet for him
in some sort of act of heroism.

58:50.196 --> 58:52.430
See, I just-- I don't think
that that's true.

58:52.432 --> 58:53.931
I think
Alex was always the target.

58:53.933 --> 58:56.067
I found this envelope
addressed to Alex

58:56.069 --> 58:58.202
in Vincenzo's jacket.
I think he took it off the body.

58:58.204 --> 58:59.837
What's inside?
It's empty.

58:59.839 --> 59:01.806
About to take it down to the lab
right now to analyze it.

59:01.808 --> 59:03.240
Just don't know
why Vincenzo would take it.

59:03.242 --> 59:05.376
Look, I know my ex
is a compulsive liar,

59:05.378 --> 59:07.044
but his story checks out so far.

59:07.046 --> 59:09.080
Someone tried to kill him
while he was in WITSEC in Iowa.

59:09.082 --> 59:10.448
PRIDE:
Agreed.

59:10.450 --> 59:11.682
Not sure an empty envelope's

59:11.684 --> 59:12.984
enough to contradict his story.

59:12.986 --> 59:14.785
Well,
it's not just an empty envelope

59:14.787 --> 59:17.622
that contradicts his story.
Vincenzo's phone does, too.

59:21.461 --> 59:22.960
I saw Alex get killed.

59:22.962 --> 59:25.630
I don't need to see
the crime scene photos.

59:25.632 --> 59:27.298
Not a crime scene photo.

59:27.300 --> 59:29.533
Found it
on Vincenzo's phone.

59:29.535 --> 59:31.602
Proof of death
for whoever hired him.

59:31.604 --> 59:34.338
If you were
his target,

59:34.340 --> 59:36.741
why would he take Alex's photo?

59:38.144 --> 59:39.510
Must have made a mistake.

59:39.512 --> 59:43.280
He shot Alex
at point-blank range.

59:43.282 --> 59:46.784
Then stopped long enough
to take a photo...

59:46.786 --> 59:49.854
and search the body
for this envelope.

59:52.692 --> 59:54.959
Alex...

59:54.961 --> 59:56.794
was always his target.

59:56.796 --> 59:58.763
I want to know why.

59:58.765 --> 01:00:01.499
You should ask Vincenzo.

01:00:01.501 --> 01:00:02.733
Vincenzo's dead.

01:00:02.735 --> 01:00:04.669
What?

01:00:04.671 --> 01:00:06.070
How'd that happen?

01:00:06.072 --> 01:00:09.340
Tried to shoot Gregorio.
She had to take him out.

01:00:11.077 --> 01:00:13.010
She's fine, by the way.

01:00:13.012 --> 01:00:15.880
(chuckling):
Yeah, I have no doubt.

01:00:15.882 --> 01:00:18.049
She's always been able
to take care of herself.

01:00:19.419 --> 01:00:21.118
Even if she
wasn't so sure of it.

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:23.254
PRIDE: I'm
trying very hard

01:00:23.256 --> 01:00:26.057
to understand
what happened here.

01:00:26.059 --> 01:00:28.159
You claim the Aufieros

01:00:28.161 --> 01:00:30.628
made an attempt on your life
while you were in hiding.

01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:33.564
Not a claim, wasn't hiding--
Witness Security.

01:00:33.566 --> 01:00:36.434
You came back to New Orleans

01:00:36.436 --> 01:00:39.970
to ask for Alex Aufiero's help
making peace.

01:00:39.972 --> 01:00:42.073
Just before a hit man kills him.

01:00:42.075 --> 01:00:44.041
We must have both been targets.

01:00:44.043 --> 01:00:46.610
Well, I understand why the
Aufieros would want you dead.

01:00:46.612 --> 01:00:48.579
You helped
send their father away

01:00:48.581 --> 01:00:50.781
for stealing $80 million
in FEMA funds, but...

01:00:50.783 --> 01:00:53.651
why would they want to kill
their little brother, too?

01:00:55.455 --> 01:00:56.754
Something else you should have
asked Vincenzo

01:00:56.756 --> 01:00:57.822
before you shot him.

01:00:57.824 --> 01:00:59.890
That's not the tone
you want to take

01:00:59.892 --> 01:01:02.226
with the only man
standing between you

01:01:02.228 --> 01:01:04.428
and another Aufiero hit man.

01:01:05.732 --> 01:01:07.898
There's a piece
you're not telling me.

01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:09.633
And it's not
doing you any favors.

01:01:09.635 --> 01:01:11.335
I've been honest.

01:01:11.337 --> 01:01:14.705
I'm slightly offended
you keep suggesting otherwise.

01:01:14.707 --> 01:01:16.874
There's still plenty of time
to get you transferred

01:01:16.876 --> 01:01:21.178
to a federal cell until
we can figure this all out.

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:23.748
On what charges?

01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:26.550
Let's keep in mind,
I haven't done anything.

01:01:26.552 --> 01:01:28.085
The Aufieros are
out for my blood.

01:01:28.087 --> 01:01:30.521
I have no idea
what was in that envelope

01:01:30.523 --> 01:01:31.989
or why Alex was killed.

01:01:31.991 --> 01:01:33.924
But I'm as good as dead.

01:01:33.926 --> 01:01:36.293
I need your help.

01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:38.529
(door opens)

01:01:38.531 --> 01:01:40.331
He's lying.
How can you tell?

01:01:40.333 --> 01:01:41.732
His lips are moving.

01:01:41.734 --> 01:01:43.100
(chuckles)

01:01:43.102 --> 01:01:44.602
He's right about one thing.

01:01:46.339 --> 01:01:48.939
We don't have anything
to charge him with.

01:01:48.941 --> 01:01:51.208
The FBI's waiting to take him
back into WITSEC.

01:01:51.210 --> 01:01:53.244
No, we need more time with him.
Ethan McKinley didn't come

01:01:53.246 --> 01:01:55.579
all the way back to New Orleans
'cause he was afraid.

01:01:55.581 --> 01:01:57.681
Fear was never a motivation
for him.

01:01:57.683 --> 01:01:59.450
Well, whatever his angle,

01:01:59.452 --> 01:02:01.886
you got to figure it out quick.

01:02:01.888 --> 01:02:04.488
I'll focus on Alex.
(phone beeps)

01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:06.157
Try to learn why his family

01:02:06.159 --> 01:02:08.526
would want to have him killed.

01:02:08.528 --> 01:02:10.294
How you gonna do that?

01:02:11.798 --> 01:02:14.565
Guess I'm gonna have a chat
with Alex's older brothers.

01:02:17.203 --> 01:02:18.636
(sighs)

01:02:18.638 --> 01:02:20.604
(door closes)

01:02:20.606 --> 01:02:22.139
That's our baby brother
in there.

01:02:22.141 --> 01:02:23.340
We'd like to bring him home.

01:02:23.342 --> 01:02:24.542
WADE:
Of course you would.

01:02:24.544 --> 01:02:26.210
But his murder is still

01:02:26.212 --> 01:02:27.278
an open investigation.

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.445
MATT: Well, that's
not what we heard.

01:02:28.447 --> 01:02:30.815
Yeah, we heard you got
the killer and he's dead.

01:02:30.817 --> 01:02:32.583
That's case closed,
as far as I'm concerned.

01:02:32.585 --> 01:02:34.418
It's a little more complicated
than that.

01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:36.053
Well, we're here
to make it simple for you.

01:02:36.055 --> 01:02:38.355
Give us some papers to sign,
let us have our brother,

01:02:38.357 --> 01:02:40.291
and there won't
be any problems.

01:02:40.293 --> 01:02:41.659
Didn't realize
there were problems.

01:02:41.661 --> 01:02:43.194
You the man in charge?

01:02:43.196 --> 01:02:45.663
Special Agent Pride.

01:02:47.466 --> 01:02:51.035
So, Matt and Theo Aufiero,

01:02:51.037 --> 01:02:52.069
Joe's other sons.

01:02:52.071 --> 01:02:53.103
You knew our dad?

01:02:53.105 --> 01:02:54.438
Used to see him around the yard

01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.040
when I'd visit my old man
in prison.

01:02:56.042 --> 01:02:57.775
Well, then you should get it.

01:02:57.777 --> 01:02:59.810
Our father makes some mistakes
and we pay the price.

01:02:59.812 --> 01:03:01.245
You won't let us have Alex

01:03:01.247 --> 01:03:02.413
because you assume
that we're criminals.

01:03:02.415 --> 01:03:03.414
It's discrimination.

01:03:03.416 --> 01:03:04.582
Is that what it is?

01:03:04.584 --> 01:03:06.684
Don't assume you're criminals.

01:03:06.686 --> 01:03:09.520
We know you run
your family's business.

01:03:09.522 --> 01:03:10.754
We run a music club.

01:03:10.756 --> 01:03:11.956
And Vincenzo Moretti,

01:03:11.958 --> 01:03:14.825
the man who murdered
your brother,

01:03:14.827 --> 01:03:17.127
he's been doing
your dirty work for years.

01:03:17.129 --> 01:03:19.296
If we had our own
brother murdered,

01:03:19.298 --> 01:03:21.398
why would we come
into a building full of cops

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:22.766
to collect his body?

01:03:22.768 --> 01:03:24.235
(chuckles)
Well, that...

01:03:24.237 --> 01:03:26.570
(clears throat)
...that's a good question.

01:03:26.572 --> 01:03:28.772
You're gonna be hearing
from our lawyer.

01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:32.610
(Wade scoffs)

01:03:32.612 --> 01:03:34.111
That display of bravado

01:03:34.113 --> 01:03:37.014
is about more
than brotherly love.

01:03:37.016 --> 01:03:39.817
They want Alex's body
for some reason. Why?

01:03:39.819 --> 01:03:41.886
I might be able to answer that.

01:03:42.889 --> 01:03:44.521
I analyzed the empty envelope

01:03:44.523 --> 01:03:46.457
we got from Vincenzo's body.

01:03:46.459 --> 01:03:49.593
What I found is
pretty explosive.

01:03:49.595 --> 01:03:53.364
It looks like a magnification
of a white envelope.

01:03:53.366 --> 01:03:56.066
An envelope with the faintest
of logos embossed in it:

01:03:56.068 --> 01:03:57.534
two Hs intertwined.

01:03:57.536 --> 01:03:58.969
And what's it a logo for?

01:03:58.971 --> 01:04:00.304
Holden and Holden law firm,

01:04:00.306 --> 01:04:01.872
but that's not
the explosive part.

01:04:01.874 --> 01:04:04.074
They've been representing
the Aufieros for years.

01:04:04.076 --> 01:04:07.077
It's not a surprise that
Alex would have an envelope

01:04:07.079 --> 01:04:08.412
from the family's firm.

01:04:08.414 --> 01:04:10.147
Still doesn't tell us
what was inside.

01:04:10.149 --> 01:04:11.749
Well, Lasalle and Percy
are on their way

01:04:11.751 --> 01:04:13.484
to the law firm now
to try to find out.

01:04:13.486 --> 01:04:15.119
Well, they'll get hit
with client confidentiality.

01:04:15.121 --> 01:04:16.153
Won't get far.

01:04:16.155 --> 01:04:17.054
They might not need to.

01:04:17.056 --> 01:04:18.088
See, I found something else

01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:19.356
on the inside of the envelope.

01:04:21.127 --> 01:04:23.060
Is this the explosive part?

01:04:23.062 --> 01:04:24.428
SEBASTIAN:
It is.

01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:29.266
Magnetized ink
containing iron oxide.

01:04:30.369 --> 01:04:31.502
(Sebastian chuckles)

01:04:31.504 --> 01:04:33.837
I oversold the explosive part.

01:04:33.839 --> 01:04:35.339
I get it, okay?

01:04:35.341 --> 01:04:37.107
It's just that forensic
material analysis,

01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:38.409
it's a, it's a real
subtle science.

01:04:38.411 --> 01:04:39.944
(Pride clears throat)
Anyway, the point is,

01:04:39.946 --> 01:04:41.912
at the bottom of every
check or bank record,

01:04:41.914 --> 01:04:44.782
there's a code with account
and routing numbers.

01:04:44.784 --> 01:04:46.550
They're printed
with the same kind of ink.

01:04:46.552 --> 01:04:48.285
You're saying
that bank documents

01:04:48.287 --> 01:04:49.453
were inside this envelope.

01:04:49.455 --> 01:04:50.888
Yeah, and a bank card.

01:04:50.890 --> 01:04:52.790
I was able to reconstruct
the routing number

01:04:52.792 --> 01:04:55.125
based on the pattern
of the ink residue.

01:04:56.862 --> 01:04:59.964
It belongs
to Cayman Limited Trust.

01:04:59.966 --> 01:05:01.165
They do a pretty
brisk business

01:05:01.167 --> 01:05:02.533
in offshore,
anonymous accounts.

01:05:02.535 --> 01:05:03.600
It's where all
the biggest thieves

01:05:03.602 --> 01:05:04.868
hide their money these days.

01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:06.203
Any idea how much money?

01:05:06.205 --> 01:05:07.638
No, but it's got to be a lot.

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:09.473
I mean, Cayman Limited
won't even open up

01:05:09.475 --> 01:05:10.808
one of these accounts
with a deposit

01:05:10.810 --> 01:05:12.376
of less than
ten million dollars.

01:05:12.378 --> 01:05:13.577
(whistles)

01:05:13.579 --> 01:05:14.945
Now I'm starting
to understand

01:05:14.947 --> 01:05:18.415
why the Aufieros had
their brother killed.

01:05:21.387 --> 01:05:24.621
We struck out
at the Aufieros' law firm,

01:05:24.623 --> 01:05:27.791
dropped the iron curtain the
minute they heard we were feds.

01:05:27.793 --> 01:05:29.360
But a paralegal
admitted Alex

01:05:29.362 --> 01:05:31.495
had an appointment there
the day he died

01:05:31.497 --> 01:05:33.464
to collect his portion
of his father's will.

01:05:33.466 --> 01:05:35.899
That's all I need
to do my magic.

01:05:35.901 --> 01:05:38.936
Tapped into the law firm's
security cam feed, found this.

01:05:38.938 --> 01:05:41.839
SONJA: Now, this is two
hours before Alex's murder.

01:05:41.841 --> 01:05:44.274
20 minutes later...

01:05:46.178 --> 01:05:47.678
...he came back out.

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:49.546
PRIDE: That's the envelope
he was killed for.

01:05:49.548 --> 01:05:51.415
Wait for it.

01:05:51.417 --> 01:05:54.685
Boom. McKinley was waiting
in his car.

01:05:54.687 --> 01:05:57.521
Something he conveniently
left out of his story.

01:05:57.523 --> 01:06:01.058
That's not all
he was lying about.

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:04.661
Des Moines PD sent me
crime scene photos

01:06:04.663 --> 01:06:06.296
from the attempt
on Ethan's life.

01:06:06.298 --> 01:06:08.265
SONJA: Whoa, it looks like
it was an epic gun battle.

01:06:08.267 --> 01:06:10.367
Too epic.
Vincenzo Moretti is connected

01:06:10.369 --> 01:06:11.869
to a dozen contract killings,

01:06:11.871 --> 01:06:15.305
all murdered like Alex,
up close and in public.

01:06:15.307 --> 01:06:17.374
Why change his M.O.?

01:06:17.376 --> 01:06:18.742
You think this was staged?

01:06:18.744 --> 01:06:20.077
I know it was.

01:06:20.079 --> 01:06:21.945
Like I said, Ethan was
never motivated by fear.

01:06:21.947 --> 01:06:23.614
Money, on the other hand...

01:06:23.616 --> 01:06:25.282
A whole lot of money.

01:06:25.284 --> 01:06:28.986
Seems to be motivating
Theo and Matt Aufiero, too.

01:06:28.988 --> 01:06:30.320
And Ethan came back
to New Orleans

01:06:30.322 --> 01:06:31.955
to con Alex out
of his inheritance.

01:06:31.957 --> 01:06:33.657
But Alex's brothers
had him killed

01:06:33.659 --> 01:06:36.760
before McKinley could succeed,
took the bank documents.

01:06:36.762 --> 01:06:39.830
So when McKinley's plan “A”
didn't work out...

01:06:39.832 --> 01:06:41.765
He came running to
me for a plan “B”.

01:06:41.767 --> 01:06:43.400
Figured our little investigation

01:06:43.402 --> 01:06:45.636
would lead him
to the Aufieros and the money.

01:06:45.638 --> 01:06:47.771
Must be a hell of a lot of dough
in that account.

01:06:47.773 --> 01:06:50.941
Yeah. About $80 million.

01:06:50.943 --> 01:06:53.010
The FEMA funds.

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:56.713
Stolen by Joe Aufiero

01:06:56.715 --> 01:06:59.216
with McKinley's help
and never recovered.

01:06:59.218 --> 01:07:01.185
That money's been sitting
in that account all these years

01:07:01.187 --> 01:07:03.087
until Alex was ready
to collect it.

01:07:03.089 --> 01:07:06.290
But why wouldn't Joe split it
amongst all three of his sons?

01:07:06.292 --> 01:07:07.825
'Cause Alex was his favorite,

01:07:07.827 --> 01:07:10.094
the one he was hoping
would carry on his legacy.

01:07:10.096 --> 01:07:12.062
Yeah, but Navy hero Alex
seems like the type

01:07:12.064 --> 01:07:15.132
who would return the money
when he realized it was stolen.

01:07:15.134 --> 01:07:19.002
That's 80 million reasons
why his brothers want him dead.

01:07:19.004 --> 01:07:20.370
And based on
their desperate behavior,

01:07:20.372 --> 01:07:21.872
trying to get Alex's body
at the morgue,

01:07:21.874 --> 01:07:23.740
they haven't gotten access
to the money yet,

01:07:23.742 --> 01:07:27.611
which means we have a chance
to return it to New Orleans,

01:07:27.613 --> 01:07:29.179
take down what's left
of the Aufieros.

01:07:29.181 --> 01:07:32.683
And we figure out the piece
that they're missing,

01:07:32.685 --> 01:07:34.384
and get to it
before they do...

01:07:34.386 --> 01:07:36.620
Ethan's the only one
that could fill in the blanks.

01:07:36.622 --> 01:07:37.955
Interrogation's all yours.

01:07:37.957 --> 01:07:40.824
No, I'm playing it
his way this time.

01:07:40.826 --> 01:07:43.560
I'm gonna con him.

01:07:49.301 --> 01:07:50.801
McKINLEY:
Where are you taking me?

01:07:50.803 --> 01:07:52.035
Safe house.

01:07:52.037 --> 01:07:53.804
Safe house in the Ninth?

01:07:53.806 --> 01:07:55.706
Kind of a contradiction,
isn't it?

01:07:55.708 --> 01:07:57.474
Look at this place,
they haven't even rebuilt.

01:07:57.476 --> 01:07:59.776
Someone stole their money.

01:07:59.778 --> 01:08:01.945
Look, T, I know I did wrong.

01:08:01.947 --> 01:08:03.914
I had a lot of time to think,

01:08:03.916 --> 01:08:06.550
all those lonely,
winter nights in Iowa.

01:08:06.552 --> 01:08:07.951
I learned humility.

01:08:07.953 --> 01:08:09.286
And if I could
fix it all...

01:08:09.288 --> 01:08:10.754
Maybe you can.

01:08:12.291 --> 01:08:15.459
What if you helped
return the $80 million?

01:08:15.461 --> 01:08:18.694
Took the Aufieros down,
got your life back.

01:08:18.697 --> 01:08:21.665
My life means nothing to me.

01:08:21.667 --> 01:08:23.167
But our life,

01:08:23.169 --> 01:08:24.868
what we had,

01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:26.170
I'd do it in a nanosecond.

01:08:26.171 --> 01:08:27.237
Ethan.

01:08:27.238 --> 01:08:28.971
Remember that first trip
we made? Anguilla.

01:08:28.974 --> 01:08:32.542
Just you, me
and umbrella drinks.

01:08:32.545 --> 01:08:36.279
(sighs) No lies, no resentment,
not a care in the world.

01:08:37.616 --> 01:08:39.883
You know I've always
loved you, T.

01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:43.220
(sighs)

01:08:45.524 --> 01:08:47.024
I'm gay.

01:08:49.228 --> 01:08:50.827
Not the response
I was expecting.

01:08:50.828 --> 01:08:53.964
Yeah, well, there's a lot
about me you don't know.

01:08:53.966 --> 01:08:55.532
(sighs)
Gay, huh?

01:08:55.533 --> 01:08:57.968
So, in a way,

01:08:57.970 --> 01:09:01.037
my betrayal kind of gave you
a chance to find yourself.

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:05.274
Wow. How does my personal
revelation become your victory?

01:09:05.277 --> 01:09:07.044
I'm just saying.

01:09:07.046 --> 01:09:08.377
I've always been
good for you.

01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:10.080
You do know what
gay means, right?

01:09:10.082 --> 01:09:12.549
Can we just focus
on the case?

01:09:12.551 --> 01:09:13.716
Excuse me.

01:09:13.719 --> 01:09:16.486
I-I wish I knew
where the money was.

01:09:16.488 --> 01:09:18.589
It's in an offshore account
under Alex's name.

01:09:18.591 --> 01:09:20.224
That's why his brothers
killed him.

01:09:20.225 --> 01:09:22.359
Probably why they
tried to kill you.

01:09:22.361 --> 01:09:24.728
Yeah, they thought I
knew about the account.

01:09:24.729 --> 01:09:26.529
Yeah, I wish I did, but...

01:09:26.532 --> 01:09:28.631
it's too late now.
They got the money.

01:09:28.634 --> 01:09:29.633
They haven't
accessed it yet.

01:09:29.635 --> 01:09:31.401
They tried to get
Alex's body.

01:09:31.403 --> 01:09:33.737
I'm figuring they needed
a fingerprint or eye scan.

01:09:34.907 --> 01:09:36.372
Hey, listen.

01:09:36.375 --> 01:09:40.810
We got a chance,
with your help, to stop them.

01:09:40.813 --> 01:09:42.578
Please.

01:09:42.581 --> 01:09:44.081
(sighs)

01:09:44.082 --> 01:09:46.015
I want to help you, T.

01:09:46.018 --> 01:09:48.385
I-I want to spend the rest of my
life making up for what I did,

01:09:48.386 --> 01:09:51.688
but I have no idea
how to get that money.

01:09:51.689 --> 01:09:53.290
(scoffs)

01:09:58.731 --> 01:10:01.098
Let me sweep the house.
Stay here.

01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:04.368
(sighs)

01:10:25.190 --> 01:10:26.823
(car beeps)

01:10:26.825 --> 01:10:29.059
(car dinging)

01:10:30.162 --> 01:10:33.430
GREGORIO:
Some people never change.

01:10:33.432 --> 01:10:35.299
You hotwire cars now, too?

01:10:35.301 --> 01:10:37.000
Not very well, apparently.

01:10:37.002 --> 01:10:38.902
That was all me.

01:10:38.904 --> 01:10:42.639
See, I have an app on my phone
that remotely shuts my car off

01:10:42.641 --> 01:10:45.008
because I knew
you'd try to escape.

01:10:45.010 --> 01:10:46.510
Come on,
what did you expect?

01:10:46.512 --> 01:10:48.979
$80 million is
a lot of money, T.

01:10:48.981 --> 01:10:50.180
Can't blame me for trying.

01:10:50.182 --> 01:10:52.349
Oh, I blame you
for a lot of things.

01:10:52.351 --> 01:10:55.218
And I know you have some kind of
devious plan to get that money.

01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:57.921
Doesn't matter now,
because I am going to jail.

01:10:57.923 --> 01:10:59.756
Sure your little team
is waiting in the bushes

01:10:59.758 --> 01:11:00.991
ready to arrest me.

01:11:00.993 --> 01:11:02.993
No, you're not going
anywhere, Ethan.

01:11:02.995 --> 01:11:06.029
You're gonna help the
Aufieros steal that money

01:11:06.031 --> 01:11:09.700
or I will throw your
sorry ass in jail.

01:11:23.706 --> 01:11:27.474
♪ Standing at that bus stop... ♪

01:11:27.476 --> 01:11:29.710
McKINLEY:
<i>Hey, boys.</i>

01:11:29.712 --> 01:11:31.545
Long time no see.

01:11:31.547 --> 01:11:33.280
Nice joint.

01:11:33.282 --> 01:11:34.348
Classy.

01:11:34.350 --> 01:11:35.816
♪ Waiting for the driver... ♪

01:11:35.818 --> 01:11:36.817
Unbelievable.

01:11:36.819 --> 01:11:38.518
You got nerve
showing your face here.

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:41.154
What I got is a
business opportunity.

01:11:41.156 --> 01:11:42.889
How would you two like
to be $80 million richer?

01:11:42.891 --> 01:11:44.625
MATT: <i>No idea what</i>
<i>you're talking about.</i>

01:11:44.627 --> 01:11:46.159
McKINLEY:
Alex's inheritance.

01:11:46.161 --> 01:11:47.861
You stole a bank card
and the account number,

01:11:47.863 --> 01:11:50.097
but you can't access
the money without him,

01:11:50.099 --> 01:11:53.934
which I bet you wish you had
known before you had him killed.

01:11:53.936 --> 01:11:56.069
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Oh, come on.

01:11:56.071 --> 01:11:57.371
Everybody just calm down.

01:11:57.373 --> 01:11:59.506
(laughing): God.
Wha... hey, hey, hey.

01:11:59.508 --> 01:12:01.608
MATT: Hey, shut up!
THEO: Hold still.

01:12:01.610 --> 01:12:03.577
This is a $400 shirt.

01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:06.480
You ratted on our dad.

01:12:06.482 --> 01:12:08.548
We're not taking any changes.
You hold still.

01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:11.084
It's a good thing we didn't
give him a wire.

01:12:11.086 --> 01:12:14.054
All I need is some Wi-Fi access,
a few keystrokes,

01:12:14.056 --> 01:12:16.189
I turned his cell phone
into a mic

01:12:16.191 --> 01:12:18.458
and their security camera
into my private screening room.

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:19.593
Clever.

01:12:19.595 --> 01:12:20.827
Frightening, but clever.

01:12:20.829 --> 01:12:22.229
Oh, don't worry.

01:12:22.231 --> 01:12:24.197
Big Brother Patton only
uses his power for good.

01:12:24.199 --> 01:12:25.799
Yeah, well, the
jury's still out

01:12:25.801 --> 01:12:27.567
on whether saving Ethan's
an act of goodness.

01:12:27.569 --> 01:12:28.902
All right, I'm clean.

01:12:28.904 --> 01:12:30.737
Look, look!
I'm clean.

01:12:30.739 --> 01:12:32.105
Why should we trust you?

01:12:32.107 --> 01:12:34.041
I'm not asking for trust.

01:12:34.043 --> 01:12:36.543
Trust is overrated
in business.

01:12:36.545 --> 01:12:38.845
Need, on the other
hand, very useful.

01:12:38.847 --> 01:12:41.682
We need each other
to get that money.

01:12:41.684 --> 01:12:43.817
No one can access the
account without the other.

01:12:43.819 --> 01:12:45.686
Yeah, well, unless you can bring
Alex back from the dead,

01:12:45.688 --> 01:12:46.987
I believe that ship has sailed.

01:12:46.989 --> 01:12:48.789
I can do better.

01:12:48.791 --> 01:12:50.490
I can be the dead.

01:12:50.492 --> 01:12:51.595
Whoa, whoa!

01:12:51.619 --> 01:12:53.261
Oh, I am more than happy
to help with that.

01:12:53.262 --> 01:12:54.628
McKINLEY:
Theo, that's my jugular.

01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:56.029
Think he's in
over his head?

01:12:56.031 --> 01:12:58.398
Nah, Ethan's always
liked a close shave.

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:00.400
Look, you guys, I know your
brother better than anybody.

01:13:00.402 --> 01:13:02.269
I know his favorite color.
I know his first girlfriend.

01:13:02.271 --> 01:13:05.539
I know the name of every sailor
in his basic training class.

01:13:05.541 --> 01:13:08.675
Without his fingerprints or his
eyes, you can't get the money.

01:13:08.677 --> 01:13:10.010
Actually, I got both.

01:13:10.012 --> 01:13:11.378
Ten years ago,

01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:14.047
your dad sent me to set up
that account for Alex.

01:13:14.049 --> 01:13:17.084
Instead of bringing him along,
I became him.

01:13:17.086 --> 01:13:20.187
Went to the bank, gave
them my biometrics.

01:13:20.189 --> 01:13:24.324
And now I am the only one
that can access that account.

01:13:26.328 --> 01:13:28.395
All I need is that bank card.

01:13:28.397 --> 01:13:29.863
That is genius.

01:13:29.865 --> 01:13:31.665
Mm-hmm. He's always 12
chess moves ahead.

01:13:31.667 --> 01:13:33.133
McKinley's counting on the fact

01:13:33.135 --> 01:13:34.868
that greed outweighs anger.

01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:37.471
Okay.

01:13:39.007 --> 01:13:40.640
Okay.

01:13:40.642 --> 01:13:42.509
So what's the plan?

01:13:44.313 --> 01:13:45.812
You believe this is gonna work?

01:13:45.814 --> 01:13:48.081
I don't know we got
a lot of options.

01:13:48.083 --> 01:13:49.916
We want the money
returned to the city.

01:13:49.918 --> 01:13:52.819
We want Matt and Theo
Aufiero behind bars.

01:13:52.821 --> 01:13:55.655
Yeah, but how can we trust
McKinley will stay on script?

01:13:55.657 --> 01:13:57.758
Simple. We can't.

01:13:57.760 --> 01:14:00.193
Come on.

01:14:00.195 --> 01:14:02.028
I look good, right?

01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:03.764
You look fine.

01:14:05.267 --> 01:14:06.867
At least admit
this is the perfect con.

01:14:06.869 --> 01:14:09.469
It's a sting operation,
not a con.

01:14:09.471 --> 01:14:11.838
Yeah, but really,
what's the difference?

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:13.640
Handcuffs and prison sentences.

01:14:13.642 --> 01:14:16.343
And if it's not the Aufieros
going away, it'll be you.

01:14:16.345 --> 01:14:18.745
PRIDE: We need every penny
of the $80 million dollars

01:14:18.747 --> 01:14:20.580
transferred
into the Aufiero account.

01:14:20.582 --> 01:14:22.516
That's how we're gonna make
our case against them.

01:14:22.518 --> 01:14:24.418
Patton and I will monitor
the transaction.

01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:25.552
And we're arresting the brothers

01:14:25.554 --> 01:14:27.587
as soon as the money
is deposited.

01:14:27.589 --> 01:14:28.688
Piece of cake.

01:14:28.690 --> 01:14:30.824
You deviate one inch
from the plan

01:14:30.826 --> 01:14:33.126
and you're done. Understood?

01:14:33.128 --> 01:14:35.729
We are all part
of the same team.

01:14:35.731 --> 01:14:37.564
Don't worry.

01:14:37.566 --> 01:14:39.399
You can trust me.

01:14:47.376 --> 01:14:49.309
SONJA:
McKinley's here.

01:14:49.311 --> 01:14:52.212
God, he's enjoying this
way too much.

01:14:54.716 --> 01:14:56.550
Hi.

01:14:56.552 --> 01:14:59.619
I would like to access
my account and make a transfer.

01:14:59.621 --> 01:15:02.756
Of course. And how much were you
planning on transferring today?

01:15:02.758 --> 01:15:04.157
The entire balance.

01:15:04.159 --> 01:15:05.125
(gasps)

01:15:05.127 --> 01:15:06.793
$80 million?

01:15:06.795 --> 01:15:09.996
Please wait here, Lt. Aufiero.

01:15:09.998 --> 01:15:11.565
What do you think that's about?

01:15:11.567 --> 01:15:12.999
Can't just transfer $80 million

01:15:13.001 --> 01:15:14.835
without jumping
through some hoops.

01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:19.306
Uh, Lt. Aufiero?

01:15:19.308 --> 01:15:20.907
Lloyd Williams.

01:15:20.909 --> 01:15:22.809
I was your father's
banker for years.

01:15:22.811 --> 01:15:23.810
Of course, Mr. Williams.

01:15:23.812 --> 01:15:25.278
Uh, right this way, please.

01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:27.080
WILLIAMS: I just wanted
to give you my condolences

01:15:27.082 --> 01:15:29.316
on your father's
passing last year.

01:15:29.318 --> 01:15:30.817
I'm surprised
you weren't at the funeral.

01:15:30.819 --> 01:15:32.719
Oh, I was overseas. I
would love to catch up,

01:15:32.721 --> 01:15:34.654
but I have to complete my
business and get back to base.

01:15:34.656 --> 01:15:36.089
Uh, we met before.

01:15:36.091 --> 01:15:37.858
You were in high school,

01:15:37.860 --> 01:15:39.226
playing basketball
against my son's team.

01:15:39.228 --> 01:15:42.496
Ha.
Yeah, you were point guard.

01:15:42.498 --> 01:15:44.297
McKINLEY:
Yeah, well, long time ago.

01:15:44.299 --> 01:15:46.833
Well, I mean,
my boy towered over you,

01:15:46.835 --> 01:15:48.702
and he's barely six feet.

01:15:48.704 --> 01:15:50.637
This isn't good.

01:15:53.442 --> 01:15:55.342
I had a growth spurt in college.

01:15:55.344 --> 01:15:56.743
You know how it is.

01:15:56.745 --> 01:15:58.678
Actually, I don't.

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:01.147
Lt. Aufiero. Is that...

01:16:01.149 --> 01:16:03.350
Yes, it is. Oh, my goodness.

01:16:03.352 --> 01:16:05.185
Hi, uh, I'm sorry to interrupt.

01:16:05.187 --> 01:16:06.453
Dwayne Pride, NCIS.

01:16:06.455 --> 01:16:08.455
So, you know Lt. Aufiero?

01:16:08.457 --> 01:16:10.190
Yes, sir. I, uh, I watched him

01:16:10.192 --> 01:16:11.992
receive a Silver Star
for bravery.

01:16:11.994 --> 01:16:14.895
He pulled three marines
out of a burning Humvee

01:16:14.897 --> 01:16:16.630
under enemy fire.

01:16:16.632 --> 01:16:17.964
Including a close friend.

01:16:17.966 --> 01:16:19.766
Wow, that's an incredible story.

01:16:19.768 --> 01:16:22.135
PRIDE:
Incredible man.

01:16:22.137 --> 01:16:27.941
I'm sorry, I-I just, I just had
to say hello and say thank you.

01:16:27.943 --> 01:16:30.777
All right, Lt. Aufiero, let's
access your account, shall we?

01:16:30.779 --> 01:16:33.146
Okay.

01:16:33.148 --> 01:16:36.917
Now, first, I'll need
your fingerprint there.

01:16:42.457 --> 01:16:44.891
(beeping)

01:16:44.893 --> 01:16:47.227
And now an ocular scan.

01:16:52.434 --> 01:16:55.268
All right. Everything
seems to be in order.

01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:57.771
Uh, to what account would you
like the balance transferred?

01:16:58.874 --> 01:17:01.374
Here you go.

01:17:04.913 --> 01:17:06.379
All done.

01:17:07.416 --> 01:17:08.682
Thank you for your business.

01:17:08.684 --> 01:17:10.850
No. Thank you.

01:17:10.852 --> 01:17:12.852
SONJA: Patton confirmed
the money's been transferred.

01:17:12.854 --> 01:17:15.021
I'm heading out.

01:17:19.528 --> 01:17:22.362
I just made
a career case for you

01:17:22.364 --> 01:17:24.965
and you can't trust me
to walk 50 feet to the SUV?

01:17:24.967 --> 01:17:27.033
You really want me
to answer that?

01:17:27.035 --> 01:17:28.568
(laughs)

01:17:28.570 --> 01:17:30.337
Hey. All joking aside,

01:17:30.339 --> 01:17:33.139
I want to thank you
for giving me another chance.

01:17:33.141 --> 01:17:36.943
For, um, I don't know,
believing in me, when...

01:17:36.945 --> 01:17:38.511
I didn't give you
any reason to.

01:17:38.513 --> 01:17:40.413
(tires screeching)

01:17:40.415 --> 01:17:41.648
Ethan, get down.

01:17:49.891 --> 01:17:51.825
Get your hands up!

01:17:54.162 --> 01:17:54.824
Gun on the ground.

01:17:54.848 --> 01:17:56.848
- Gun on the ground, slow.
- Okay.

01:17:56.965 --> 01:17:58.431
Okay.

01:17:59.768 --> 01:18:02.435
SONJA: His brother's
unconscious.

01:18:03.772 --> 01:18:04.838
I'm calling 911.

01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:07.307
Where the hell is McKinley?

01:18:07.309 --> 01:18:08.875
He can't have gotten far.

01:18:08.877 --> 01:18:10.410
(phone chimes)

01:18:10.412 --> 01:18:12.545
We got a bigger problem.
Patton just texted.

01:18:12.547 --> 01:18:15.015
The money's not
in Aufieros' account.

01:18:15.017 --> 01:18:16.282
What do you mean?

01:18:16.284 --> 01:18:17.417
Somehow McKinley transferred it

01:18:17.419 --> 01:18:19.886
back to Alex's Cayman account.

01:18:19.888 --> 01:18:22.122
So he's the only one
who has access to it?

01:18:22.124 --> 01:18:23.990
That son of a bitch played us.

01:18:39.364 --> 01:18:41.430
THEO: <i>So you want to tell me</i>
<i>how my brother's doing,</i>

01:18:41.432 --> 01:18:43.265
or what?
Matt's fine.

01:18:43.267 --> 01:18:45.234
He's got a broken wrist
and a couple bruised ribs.

01:18:45.236 --> 01:18:47.203
The two of you got
bigger problems, Theo.

01:18:47.205 --> 01:18:49.438
Like colluding
with Ethan McKinley

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:50.773
to steal $80 million.

01:18:50.775 --> 01:18:52.308
Attempting to kill
a federal agent?

01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:53.876
We didn't know she was a cop.

01:18:53.878 --> 01:18:55.444
Oh, and that makes it
so much better?

01:18:55.446 --> 01:18:57.480
And we weren't trying
to kill anyone.

01:18:57.482 --> 01:18:58.981
We were trying to stop McKinley

01:18:58.983 --> 01:19:00.816
from taking
our dead brother's money.

01:19:00.818 --> 01:19:02.652
That money doesn't
belong to you,

01:19:02.654 --> 01:19:04.587
and it didn't belong
to your brother, either.

01:19:04.589 --> 01:19:06.756
All right? It belongs
to the city of New Orleans.

01:19:06.758 --> 01:19:08.357
And you hired a hit man
to kill your brother,

01:19:08.359 --> 01:19:10.593
probably because
he was an upstanding citizen

01:19:10.595 --> 01:19:12.161
and would've returned
the money.

01:19:12.163 --> 01:19:14.230
Then we got you
on tape agreeing

01:19:14.232 --> 01:19:16.232
to commit bank fraud
with McKinley.

01:19:16.234 --> 01:19:17.566
You might want
to check the tape.

01:19:17.568 --> 01:19:18.868
'Cause I don't remember

01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:21.771
agreeing to anything.

01:19:21.773 --> 01:19:23.639
See, the first rule of surviving
as an Aufiero

01:19:23.641 --> 01:19:26.876
is you need to always assume
you're being recorded.

01:19:26.878 --> 01:19:28.010
Oh, yeah.

01:19:28.012 --> 01:19:31.747
And that's gotten you so far.

01:19:37.622 --> 01:19:39.355
SONJA: <i>We questioned</i>
<i>both Matt and Theo.</i>

01:19:39.357 --> 01:19:41.524
Neither one of them
will confess.

01:19:41.526 --> 01:19:44.026
We still can't connect them
to the hit on their brother.

01:19:44.028 --> 01:19:46.495
And we reviewed the tapes
of the meeting with McKinley,

01:19:46.497 --> 01:19:48.230
and they never actually agreed

01:19:48.232 --> 01:19:49.899
to helping him steal
the $80 million.

01:19:49.901 --> 01:19:53.836
And since the $80 million is
no longer in their account,

01:19:53.838 --> 01:19:56.205
they are looking at
a few years in prison,

01:19:56.207 --> 01:19:58.174
not the 30 to life they deserve.

01:19:58.176 --> 01:20:00.543
McKinley planned
the whole thing.

01:20:00.545 --> 01:20:02.278
Figured out a way to
transfer the money

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:05.381
back into Alex's account,
and then used the Aufieros

01:20:05.383 --> 01:20:07.083
as a diversion to
escape custody.

01:20:07.085 --> 01:20:09.452
Yeah, but how'd he know
Matt and Theo would show up

01:20:09.454 --> 01:20:11.287
at the exact moment
he left the bank?

01:20:11.289 --> 01:20:14.757
Simple. Found a warning text
from Ethan on Theo's phone.

01:20:14.759 --> 01:20:16.192
He knew they'd try to kill him,

01:20:16.194 --> 01:20:18.294
and he knew I'd protect him
no matter what.

01:20:18.296 --> 01:20:19.962
Hey, don't beat yourself up,
Gregorio.

01:20:19.964 --> 01:20:21.297
He played us all.

01:20:21.299 --> 01:20:22.631
No, I'm not beating
up on myself,

01:20:22.633 --> 01:20:24.066
I'm just trying to figure
out his next move.

01:20:24.068 --> 01:20:26.469
Well, he doesn't have many.
I mean, you steal $80,000,

01:20:26.471 --> 01:20:29.705
you might be able to slip
away, but $80 million?

01:20:29.707 --> 01:20:32.308
He'll be flagged
at every border,

01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:34.977
airport, train station,
hotel around the world.

01:20:34.979 --> 01:20:36.445
It's just a matter of time.

01:20:36.447 --> 01:20:38.414
No, not Ethan.
If he doesn't want to be found,

01:20:38.416 --> 01:20:40.483
he'll just disappear.

01:20:40.485 --> 01:20:43.319
Without a care in the world.

01:20:54.766 --> 01:20:56.999
Can't believe you left
without saying good-bye to me.

01:20:57.001 --> 01:20:58.701
I hate good-byes, T.

01:20:58.703 --> 01:21:01.203
Yet you came to the one
place you knew I'd find you.

01:21:01.205 --> 01:21:02.371
(sighs)

01:21:02.373 --> 01:21:03.973
I am a hopeless romantic.

01:21:03.975 --> 01:21:06.342
But I figured, if you showed up,

01:21:06.344 --> 01:21:07.810
we'd have a second chance.

01:21:07.812 --> 01:21:09.345
Mm.

01:21:09.347 --> 01:21:12.114
Just you, me, our happy place.

01:21:12.116 --> 01:21:14.049
You should tell that
to the flight attendant

01:21:14.051 --> 01:21:16.185
currently residing
in your suite.

01:21:18.055 --> 01:21:20.122
You know
what's really bothering me?

01:21:20.124 --> 01:21:21.991
The fact that you
were so confident

01:21:21.993 --> 01:21:24.093
that you thought
I'd put my life on the line

01:21:24.095 --> 01:21:26.529
to save yours at that bank.

01:21:26.531 --> 01:21:29.498
That's love, T.

01:21:30.535 --> 01:21:32.902
It's okay to admit it.

01:21:32.904 --> 01:21:34.403
It's why I waited here for you.

01:21:34.405 --> 01:21:36.071
We are meant for each other.

01:21:36.073 --> 01:21:38.641
God, back in the day, I would've
done anything for you.

01:21:38.643 --> 01:21:41.877
Followed you anywhere.

01:21:45.116 --> 01:21:47.783
Well, that's 'cause I was yours
and you were mine.

01:21:47.785 --> 01:21:49.985
Yeah, not anymore.

01:21:49.987 --> 01:21:51.854
I didn't jump in front
of that car out of love,

01:21:51.856 --> 01:21:53.722
I did it because it's my job.

01:21:53.724 --> 01:21:56.192
Just like this is my job.

01:21:56.194 --> 01:21:58.994
Ethan McKinley,
you're under arrest.

01:21:58.996 --> 01:22:01.163
You are truly
the only person in this world

01:22:01.165 --> 01:22:02.565
who can still surprise me.

01:22:02.567 --> 01:22:04.767
(handcuffs click)

01:22:09.407 --> 01:22:11.207
(jazz playing loudly)

01:22:11.209 --> 01:22:12.842
Hey!
Hey.

01:22:12.844 --> 01:22:14.276
How was your trip?

01:22:14.278 --> 01:22:15.644
Well, it was...

01:22:15.646 --> 01:22:17.413
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, hang on.

01:22:17.415 --> 01:22:19.048
(music quiets)

01:22:19.050 --> 01:22:20.482
Sorry. Go ahead.

01:22:20.484 --> 01:22:22.551
Island is still
as beautiful as I remember.

01:22:22.553 --> 01:22:25.054
Company was lacking.

01:22:25.056 --> 01:22:27.056
How about a drink?

01:22:27.058 --> 01:22:28.691
Please.

01:22:33.764 --> 01:22:36.365
Thank you.

01:22:38.336 --> 01:22:40.469
Mm.

01:22:40.471 --> 01:22:42.037
You might want
to just leave that.

01:22:42.039 --> 01:22:43.572
Right there.

01:22:45.610 --> 01:22:48.510
Thank you.

01:22:48.512 --> 01:22:51.547
Aufiero brothers and McKinley
are behind bars.

01:22:51.549 --> 01:22:55.217
We recovered money
that's gonna make a difference

01:22:55.219 --> 01:22:57.786
in a lot of people's lives.

01:22:57.788 --> 01:22:59.955
All because of you.

01:22:59.957 --> 01:23:02.024
Yeah, well.

01:23:02.026 --> 01:23:04.460
I spent a lot of years
chasing Ethan's ghost.

01:23:04.462 --> 01:23:07.830
Changed who I am as a person.

01:23:07.832 --> 01:23:09.932
Now that I caught him,
I just don't know

01:23:09.934 --> 01:23:11.800
who I'm gonna be, you know?

01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:14.837
Time to find out.

01:23:14.839 --> 01:23:17.573
SONJA: No more excuses.
I know you just

01:23:17.575 --> 01:23:18.941
got off the plane, but...

01:23:18.943 --> 01:23:21.110
We're going dancing.

01:23:21.112 --> 01:23:23.679
Oh, yeah? I don't know if
you can keep up with me, though.

01:23:23.681 --> 01:23:25.881
Oh-- that is some tough talk

01:23:25.883 --> 01:23:28.984
coming from someone who's been
a shut-in for six months.

01:23:28.986 --> 01:23:30.719
GREGORIO:
Yeah, well, maybe...

01:23:30.721 --> 01:23:33.722
but I'm not the same girl
I used to be, so...

01:23:36.093 --> 01:23:38.560
