00:02.080 --> 00:03.342
My name is Dean Winchester.

00:03.480 --> 00:05.300
That big fella in there
is my brother Sam.

00:05.440 --> 00:06.464
We kill monsters.

00:06.680 --> 00:07.783
(GUNSHOTS)

00:09.560 --> 00:10.549
(GROANS)

00:10.760 --> 00:13.217
So what are you, some kind of superhero?

00:15.440 --> 00:17.465
Well, goodbye, Cass. Goodbye, Kelly.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.380
Goodbye, Crowley. Goodbye, Mom.

00:19.480 --> 00:22.347
- Dean, we don't know if Mom--
- Yeah, we do. They're all gone.

00:25.200 --> 00:26.588
I know you think that you can use him

00:26.680 --> 00:29.137
_ as some sort of an
InterdlmenSIonal can opener,

00:29.400 --> 00:30.537
and that’s ﬁne.

00:30.640 --> 00:32.187
But don't act like you care about him,

00:32.600 --> 00:34.306
because you only care about
what he can do for you.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.027
- And what about Cass?
- What about Cass?

00:36.120 --> 00:38.099
DEA/V:
He man/,bu/atea’ ﬁlm.
He made him promises.

00:38.200 --> 00:41.180
Said ”Paradise on Earth, ”
and Cass bought it.

00:41.280 --> 00:43.544
And you know what that got him?
It got him dead!

00:43.640 --> 00:45.107
Castiel.

00:46.440 --> 00:47.623
JACK: Castiel.

01:03.680 --> 01:04.704
Hi.

01:05.640 --> 01:06.823
(CHUCKLES)

01:08.160 --> 01:09.149
No.

01:10.520 --> 01:11.703
How? You're...

01:13.400 --> 01:14.389
Dead.

01:15.320 --> 01:17.026
I was. But...

01:18.320 --> 01:20.060
Aren't you gonna say hi back?

01:22.760 --> 01:23.749
Hi.

01:25.040 --> 01:26.746
I missed you, baby bear.

01:28.840 --> 01:30.102
(GROANING)

01:57.880 --> 01:59.825
Hey. How you feelin'?

02:05.080 --> 02:06.741
What you... What you working on?

02:06.840 --> 02:08.102
Dead guy in Madison.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.783
Police say it was a home invasion,

02:10.880 --> 02:14.225
but neighbor claims that
she saw the Vic's dead wife

02:14.360 --> 02:15.782
/ea ve the
cr/me
scene.

02:15.880 --> 02:17.063
SAM: Let's check it out.

02:17.440 --> 02:18.862
DEAN: What, you ready to ditch Damien?

02:19.280 --> 02:20.941
What do you wanna do?
Leave him in a ring of holy oil

02:21.040 --> 02:23.258
with some Netflix and a frozen pizza?

02:23.480 --> 02:24.583
Ha.

02:25.480 --> 02:26.663
No.

02:27.440 --> 02:30.079
(SIGHS) Actually, I thought
we'd bring him along.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.389
(SCOFFS)

02:33.120 --> 02:34.257
Uh, hell no.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.907
What, Adventures in Babysitting
the Antichrist?

02:38.240 --> 02:39.229
No, thank you.

02:39.320 --> 02:42.221
Dean, we can't hide him forever.

02:42.760 --> 02:45.547
And, you know, just keeping him
cooped up here isn't working.

02:45.640 --> 02:48.063
Yeah, it is, actually.
You wanna know why?

02:48.160 --> 02:49.787
Because as long as he's here,

02:50.080 --> 02:52.947
he's not out there doing God knows what.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.786
So what, does this mean that your plan
for bringing Mom back isn't working?

02:57.120 --> 02:58.439
Because I'll say it again.

02:58.960 --> 03:00.029
Mom's dead, Sam.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.545
Lucifer ripped out her freakin' heart.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.301
And the sooner you can
wrap your head around that,

03:04.400 --> 03:06.061
the sooner we can all move on.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.667
So you're saying you want
to move on from Mom.

03:17.800 --> 03:20.223
Right now, I wanna kill
some dead guy's dead wife.

03:20.480 --> 03:21.947
Dean, that isn ’t what this is about

03:22.040 --> 03:23.780
Jack needs to get out.

03:23.880 --> 03:26.906
He needs to get some air. We all do.

03:27.160 --> 03:28.627
He's a good kid.

03:29.440 --> 03:30.657
He is.

03:31.160 --> 03:33.060
Just give him a chance, please.

03:33.720 --> 03:34.789
For me.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.303
Jack?

03:46.680 --> 03:47.669
Hey.

03:49.840 --> 03:50.977
Cione Wars?

03:51.800 --> 03:53.301
The computer said I'd like it.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.301
I do like Ahsoka.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.542
Kind of hate Anakin.

03:57.640 --> 03:58.629
Uh...

03:58.920 --> 04:00.262
That's probably for the best.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.579
Never mind. Um, hey.

04:04.160 --> 04:05.946
You remember when I told you
what Dean and I do?

04:06.040 --> 04:07.507
Our... Our day job?

04:07.880 --> 04:10.440
You kill monsters
because you're the good guys.

04:10.560 --> 04:11.549
Right, right.

04:11.640 --> 04:13.983
And we've got a case, so...

04:15.160 --> 04:16.661
Thought you might want to come along.

04:17.240 --> 04:18.229
No.

04:20.800 --> 04:24.065
Jack, I really think
this would be good for you.

04:24.200 --> 04:26.179
You know, maybe a change
of scenery might--

04:26.280 --> 04:27.747
Get my powers working again?

04:27.920 --> 04:29.387
Yeah, maybe.

04:30.080 --> 04:32.457
_ _So I can be
your Interdlmen5|onal can opener?

04:35.480 --> 04:36.583
(SAM SIGHS)

04:37.600 --> 04:38.988
You're using me.

04:43.240 --> 04:44.309
Jack,

04:45.400 --> 04:46.617
when you were born,

04:47.800 --> 04:51.258
it ripped a hole in reality.

04:51.920 --> 04:55.504
Like, uh... Like a door
from this world to another,

04:56.440 --> 04:59.386
to a really bad, bad place.

05:01.600 --> 05:05.627
So... So Dean and Cass and I,
we closed that door.

05:07.440 --> 05:11.262
But our mom, Mary,
she's trapped on the other side.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.701
If we can get your powers back,
maybe we can open that door up.

05:15.800 --> 05:16.937
Maybe...

05:18.600 --> 05:19.589
(SIGHS)

05:19.720 --> 05:20.823
You wanna save her.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.109
Yeah.

05:26.120 --> 05:27.223
Yeah, I do.

05:29.280 --> 05:30.304
But...

05:32.560 --> 05:35.302
If this doesn't work,
if that can't happen,

05:36.280 --> 05:39.977
that's okay,
because I do care about you.

05:42.640 --> 05:43.743
But I should've told you.

05:44.040 --> 05:46.258
I'm sorry. It's a lot and...

05:49.040 --> 05:50.860
Dean can't even look at me.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.537
He wants to kill me.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.069
I won't let that happen.

06:01.160 --> 06:04.539
Listen, if there's one thing
Dean respects, it's effort.

06:05.160 --> 06:07.424
So come along, help us out.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.502
Let's go be the good guys.

06:20.760 --> 06:23.320
Agent Bonham, Agent Sager,

06:24.000 --> 06:26.423
"Special Agent Anderson." These are you?

06:26.720 --> 06:28.039
Yeah, sometimes.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.907
I thought lying was wrong.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.905
All right, here we go.
Victim, Wes Bailey.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.218
His wife, Erica, died six months ago.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.265
Heart thing, out of the blue.
Uh, question is,

06:37.360 --> 06:39.225
Why'd she come back from the dead
and knife his ass?

06:39.760 --> 06:41.022
People come back?

06:41.120 --> 06:43.065
When a person dies
and their soul can't move on--

06:43.160 --> 06:44.149
They're called ghosts.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.459
And hanging around makes them
go looney tunes.

06:47.120 --> 06:48.109
They go crazy.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.703
Yeah, question is,
since when do ghosts kill somebody

06:50.800 --> 06:51.824
and walk out the front door?

06:52.760 --> 06:54.148
(SMACKS LIPS) So maybe it's a revenant.

06:54.240 --> 06:55.741
Wait. What's a revenant?

06:56.000 --> 06:58.218
A revenant's more like a zombie.

06:59.480 --> 07:00.868
Hey, there's our witness.

07:01.200 --> 07:04.101
Jack, we're gonna talk to the witness,
check out the crime scene.

07:07.440 --> 07:09.465
You stay. Sit.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.419
SAM: Now, you're sure it was his wife?

07:16.680 --> 07:18.898
I've lived next to Erica for six years.

07:19.040 --> 07:21.463
I watered her plants every time
she and Wes took vacation.

07:23.240 --> 07:24.946
What about that night?
You notice anything else?

07:25.040 --> 07:26.905
Maybe flickering lights, cold spots?

07:28.920 --> 07:31.787
I... I think a street light did flicker.

07:33.400 --> 07:34.389
Maybe.

07:41.640 --> 07:42.823
We got a runner.

07:44.440 --> 07:45.429
Thank you.

07:51.760 --> 07:54.183
Hey! I told you to wait in the car.

07:54.280 --> 07:55.304
What the hell are you doing?

07:55.400 --> 07:57.539
I'm trying to help out.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.141
- How is this helping out?
- Hey, Dean.

08:01.120 --> 08:03.145
Thank you, Jack. Did you find anything?

08:03.600 --> 08:04.703
Just this.

08:05.880 --> 08:06.869
Oh.

08:08.080 --> 08:10.389
All right. Jack, look.

08:11.080 --> 08:12.217
This is an EMF meter.

08:12.320 --> 08:13.821
Okay, so spirits, ghosts,

08:13.920 --> 08:16.059
they put out
electromagnetic interference.

08:16.640 --> 08:18.904
If one's here, this will tell us.

08:24.320 --> 08:25.309
What's it saying?

08:25.720 --> 08:27.187
It's saying it's a revenant.

08:27.760 --> 08:29.148
We gotta check her grave.

08:29.800 --> 08:30.937
Come on.

08:36.840 --> 08:39.547
All right, well,
you said you wanted to help,

08:40.480 --> 08:41.617
so dig.

08:43.360 --> 08:45.339
Dean, what's up with all the orders?

08:45.680 --> 08:47.102
You're starting to sound like Dad.

08:47.920 --> 08:49.979
- That a bad thing?
- I'm just saying,

08:50.080 --> 08:52.457
his drill sergeant act worked with you,

08:52.560 --> 08:53.982
but it didn't work with me.

08:54.080 --> 08:55.581
And that's not the way
we're gonna get through to Jack.

08:55.720 --> 08:58.427
Look, you wanted the kid here,
he's here. All right?

08:58.520 --> 09:02.069
But I'm not gonna hold his hand
and tuck him in at night. Pass.

09:02.160 --> 09:04.378
I'm not gonna be his mother,
and neither are you.

09:05.800 --> 09:08.382
And the kid can dig,
so I'll give him that.

09:22.160 --> 09:24.105
All right, I guess we're back to ghost.

09:24.200 --> 09:25.189
SAM: Yeah.

09:25.800 --> 09:28.143
So a body rules out revenant.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.220
All right, I don't get it.

09:31.040 --> 09:32.905
I mean, a ghost that won't
show up on EMF?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.103
Doesn't make any sense.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.279
You know, I mean, we...

09:38.360 --> 09:40.385
We've got portals to apocalyptic worlds.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.983
We've got shape-shifting demons.

09:43.080 --> 09:45.537
Dealing with a whole new set
of tio’o’h/wm/(s.

09:45.640 --> 09:48.541
I say we just do what we do.

09:49.560 --> 09:52.222
My mother, could she be a ghost?

09:52.440 --> 09:54.180
No, we, uh...

09:55.080 --> 09:56.468
We burned the body.

09:57.880 --> 09:59.063
DEA/V: That’s right;

09:59.400 --> 10:02.984
and what gets burned stays dead.

10:10.280 --> 10:11.497

10:18.040 --> 10:19.359
Hello!

10:25.280 --> 10:26.668

May
I
help you?

10:45.400 --> 10:47.857

10:48.000 --> 10:50.560
Okay, no prob/em. We 7/ get
someone r/ght out there.

10:56.160 --> 10:57.229

11:09.920 --> 11:11.057
Thank you.

11:13.160 --> 11:14.741
Well? Get anything?

11:14.840 --> 11:17.297
Yeah, cops found the victim,
Gloria Simon, about an hour ago.

11:17.400 --> 11:18.617
Something ripped her apart.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.699
- Our kind of something?
- No.

11:20.800 --> 11:23.985
Gloria was on the phone
with roadside assistance when she died.

11:24.120 --> 11:26.179
Operator said she was talking
to someone named Scotty.

11:26.280 --> 11:27.269
And?

11:27.600 --> 11:29.465
According to the cops,
Scotty is her son.

11:29.760 --> 11:30.749
Uh...

11:30.840 --> 11:31.943
Was her son.

11:32.440 --> 11:33.907
He drowned in '96.

11:34.040 --> 11:35.109
(WHIRRING)

11:37.120 --> 11:41.147
So we got two ghosts
in two days and no EMF.

11:42.360 --> 11:43.497
SQ?

11:43.640 --> 11:45.380
So, aside from getting dead,

11:45.480 --> 11:47.425
what do Gloria and Wes have in common?

12:20.080 --> 12:21.104
Where's Jack?

12:21.840 --> 12:23.580
Across the street. Food run.

12:27.720 --> 12:29.062
Dean, he's not our intern.

12:29.160 --> 12:30.627
I asked you to keep an eye on him.

12:31.160 --> 12:32.184
I can see him.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.627
- He keeps staring at me.
- Yes, he wants you to like him.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.220
All right, whatever. Here, take a look.

12:40.040 --> 12:41.667
- What's this? Her diary?
- It's a grief journal.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.978
Cops found one
at the first crime scene also.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.344
Wes and Gloria were both seeing
the same grief counselor,

12:46.440 --> 12:47.657
Mia Vallens.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.580
And apparently, she gives homework.

12:49.680 --> 12:52.740
(SCOFFS) Shrinks.
Snake oil for the mind.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.577
- Or how healthy people deal.
- Yeah?

12:55.760 --> 12:58.183
All right, let's see how
good old Gloria was dealing.

12:58.400 --> 12:59.424
Here you go.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.819
’54nd now that I’ve achieved catharsis,

13:03.080 --> 13:04.820
"I can truly see the program works."

13:04.960 --> 13:06.302
"The program"? Come on, man.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.459
I mean, she's one Kool-Aid
away from Jonestown.

13:10.280 --> 13:13.306
- What'd Wes' journal say?
- More of the same.

13:13.400 --> 13:15.743
Um, he was really into
the whole catharsis thing.

13:15.840 --> 13:17.421
DEA/V: Yeah, sure. Who wouldn’t/2e?

13:17.520 --> 13:19.181
I mean, it's like another word
for "happy ending."

13:19.280 --> 13:20.349
Hi, Jack.

13:20.800 --> 13:21.789
What took you so long?

13:22.280 --> 13:24.703
The man in front of me
wanted extra kraut,

13:24.800 --> 13:26.779
but the hot dog man didn't have any.

13:27.320 --> 13:28.457
He was really angry.

13:29.920 --> 13:30.909
Mmm.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.740
That's a cool story.

13:34.120 --> 13:37.783
So let's say that Hannibal chick
is a medium, right?

13:38.120 --> 13:39.587
She's talkin' to spirits,
she's pissing them off somehow.

13:39.680 --> 13:42.501
A ghost shows up,
notches a kill, and takes off.

13:42.600 --> 13:44.864
Yeah, but then, what?
Once it's gone, no EMF?

13:45.800 --> 13:47.301
This woman can talk to ghosts?

13:47.400 --> 13:50.346
If she's the real deal,
mediums can do all kinds of frealq crap.

13:50.920 --> 13:52.308
All right, say you're right.

13:53.160 --> 13:55.742
Can't go in as FBI,
not with doctor-patient confidentiality.

13:55.840 --> 13:59.059
All right. So we'll have to go in
as something else.

13:59.720 --> 14:01.665
(CAR APPROACH AND STOP)

14:04.720 --> 14:06.904
DEAN: This is a dumb idea.
SAM: Just follow my lead.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.786
Yeah, doctor's gonna eat our liver

14:08.880 --> 14:10.825
with some fava beans
and a bottle of Chianti.

14:12.800 --> 14:13.824
Hello.

14:17.880 --> 14:18.904
Hello.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.423
Hello?

14:26.680 --> 14:27.817
Can I help you?

14:27.920 --> 14:30.559
Yeah, we're hoping to see the doctor.

14:30.680 --> 14:33.103
Oh, I'm sorry. You caught us
right at the end of our day.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.986
- Maybe tomorrow.
- No, today's good.

14:36.000 --> 14:36.989
Like right now.

14:37.080 --> 14:39.457
(STU'I'I'ERS) He...
We just need a moment of her time.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.788
You've lost someone recently?

14:41.880 --> 14:43.427
- No.
- My mother.

14:44.640 --> 14:47.143
Our mother.
We're having a difficult time.

14:49.360 --> 14:50.429
Mia Vallens.

14:50.520 --> 14:51.544
Hi. Dean.

14:52.040 --> 14:54.099
That's our little brother Jack,
and I'm Sam.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.464
I see. Please, this way.

14:56.560 --> 14:57.697
SAM: Sure.

14:58.360 --> 14:59.679
Listen, Mr. Spock,

14:59.760 --> 15:02.661
you speak when I tell you
to speak, okay?

15:02.760 --> 15:04.899
- Yes.
- Good.

15:06.320 --> 15:08.140
Your mother, she passed suddenly?

15:08.240 --> 15:09.229
Uh, yeah.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.864
Most of the people I see
are in the same boat.

15:13.800 --> 15:16.462
No warning, no goodbye,

15:16.800 --> 15:18.062
no closure.

15:18.760 --> 15:21.661
Right, yeah.
Pretty much the same for us.

15:21.760 --> 15:25.662
So how does this usually work?
You know, with your patients?

15:25.760 --> 15:30.140
Usually, they just start talking
about the person they've lost.

15:30.280 --> 15:31.941
All right, well, Mom was great,
now she's dead.

15:32.040 --> 15:33.302
What's the deal with catharsis?

15:33.400 --> 15:34.469
I'm sorry?

15:35.400 --> 15:37.106
Uh, we were wondering what that is.

15:37.200 --> 15:41.261
A patient of yours, Gloria Simon,
she referred us. She's a family friend.

15:41.360 --> 15:42.782
MIA: I don ’t talk about my patients,

15:42.920 --> 15:45.423
and Gloria wasn't supposed
to talk about me.

15:45.520 --> 15:47.181
Sure. Um, got it.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.542
But your process--

15:48.640 --> 15:50.699
My program is a range of things.

15:50.880 --> 15:53.303
Talk therapy, meditation.

15:55.760 --> 15:56.784
You ever journal?

15:57.480 --> 15:58.981
Our dad did.

16:00.080 --> 16:01.104
MIA: Dean?

16:02.080 --> 16:03.183
You journal?

16:03.480 --> 16:04.868
Ever since I was a little girl.

16:05.600 --> 16:06.589
(MIA CHUCKLES)

16:07.320 --> 16:10.346
You think this shrink stuff
is a load of crap. Am I right?

16:10.520 --> 16:12.704
- How'd you guess?
- Then why are you here?

16:12.800 --> 16:15.906
Because we all agreed
we'd give it a shot, right?

16:17.400 --> 16:18.469
Right?

16:21.240 --> 16:24.141
My brother, he's not...
He's not processing his grief.

16:24.280 --> 16:25.269
MIA: Mmm.

16:25.360 --> 16:28.147
Really? No, I'm... (CHUCKLES)
No, I'm good, actually.

16:28.240 --> 16:32.142
With death, closure,
whole freakin' bottle of Jack.

16:32.240 --> 16:33.502
Are you?

16:33.600 --> 16:36.706
Yeah, because I know that Mom's dead,

16:36.880 --> 16:38.825
and I know that she's not coming back.

16:38.920 --> 16:41.980
Okay, I hear what you're saying.
I just wish...

16:42.080 --> 16:43.945
You wish he'd be more open to therapy?

16:44.440 --> 16:45.429
(DEAN SCOFFS)

16:45.520 --> 16:46.839
Sure. Exactly.

16:47.560 --> 16:50.586
All right, this is
a safe place, right, doc?

16:52.840 --> 16:54.421
Okay. My brother's delusional.

16:54.520 --> 16:55.737
Dean.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.580
You said you wanted to
give this a shot, right?

16:57.680 --> 16:58.749
Here we go.

16:58.840 --> 17:01.343
He won't even admit that Mom's dead.
Won't even admit it.

17:01.440 --> 17:02.429
Stop.

17:02.520 --> 17:03.862
Because if he admits it, then it's real.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.457
If it's real,
then he has to deal with it,

17:06.560 --> 17:07.663
and he can't handle that.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.546
Right, because this is
so easy for you, huh?

17:09.640 --> 17:10.959
No, it's not easy.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.826
Yeah, but at least you had
a relationship with Mom.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.360
I mean, who would she always call?
Who did she look to for everything?

17:16.440 --> 17:17.429
Okay.

17:17.520 --> 17:19.340
You had something with her I never had.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.707
And now I'm just supposed to accept that
I never will have it?

18:20.320 --> 18:21.423

_ - Problem?
- You just upset your brother so much,

18:59.640 --> 19:00.959
he had to leave the room.

19:03.040 --> 19:04.940
And Jack? Look at him.

19:07.720 --> 19:09.062
He's terriﬁed of you.

19:09.520 --> 19:12.466
No. No, we're simpatico. Right, kid?

19:13.880 --> 19:15.347
We're simpatico.

19:19.480 --> 19:20.902
Convincing.

19:22.760 --> 19:23.829
You're angry, Dean.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.064
And?

19:26.160 --> 19:28.185
And if you don't want
to do anything about it,

19:28.280 --> 19:29.542
that's your business.

19:30.360 --> 19:32.100
But you're aiming it
at everyone in your life.

(DOOR OPENS)

19:34.120 --> 19:36.304
- She's a shapeshifter!
- No, no.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.618
I found hair and teeth.

19:39.320 --> 19:41.299
You must’ve shed your skin,
what couple hours ago?

19:41.400 --> 19:42.537
And here, I just thought
she was annoying.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.505
- What's going on?
- Doc's a monster.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.467
- She killed her patients.
- No! No. No.

19:50.280 --> 19:52.544
I am what you say,

19:52.640 --> 19:54.665
but I have never killed anyone.

19:55.040 --> 19:57.383
- Then what are you doing here?
- I'm helping people.

1' shift into the person
that they’ve lost

20:04.560 --> 20:06.824
so that they could see them
one last time,

20:06.920 --> 20:08.581
so that they can say goodbye.

They're both dead.

20:19.960 --> 20:21.063
What?

20:21.160 --> 20:22.900
Gloria was killed by her son,

20:23.040 --> 20:25.019
or at least someone who looked like him.

20:25.160 --> 20:26.866
Three nights ago,
Wes was killed by somebody

how you're innocent again?

the women's shelter downtown.

cosmic entity.

and you freak out,
rip out your own eyes, et cetera.

wouldn't it, for both of us?

creation, destruction, Heaven, Hell,
your precious little Earth,

21:45.720 --> 21:46.709
what was there?

21:48.040 --> 21:49.223
Nothing.

21:49.320 --> 21:53.063
Yes. That's right. Nothing.

21:53.160 --> 21:55.583
Nothing but empty.

21:55.680 --> 21:57.181
And you are soaking in it.

you all come here when you die.

Yes, sleeping an endless peaceful sleep.

You know, I... I was sleeping, too.

Hey, uh, since we're pals,
there's something I've gotta know.

22:18.360 --> 22:19.861
I've just gotta ask.

22:20.120 --> 22:22.862
Hmm. Why are you awake?

22:24.120 --> 22:25.667
'Cause, fun fact,

when you woke up, I woke up,
and I don't like being awake.

I was young and stupid.

He'd ruin their lives.

He said he liked to see
the look on their face

they had nothing left.
