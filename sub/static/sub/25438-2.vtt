WEBVTT

00:06.256 --> 00:08.049
[funky music playing]

00:11.177 --> 00:13.179
[wrestlers shouting]

00:15.432 --> 00:16.808
-Hi, we're here for the show.
-Shh!

00:16.891 --> 00:18.893
[whispering] Ruth,
we've got four late arrivals.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.645
-[Ruth]<i> Copy. Front row, left.</i>
-[mouthing]

00:20.729 --> 00:21.563
Let's go.

00:21.646 --> 00:23.898
[Keith] Two-on-one.
I'm calling a two-on-one.

00:25.191 --> 00:27.318
[Bash] Oh! And here come
the Biddy Sisters,

00:27.402 --> 00:31.531
dropping off a clothesline
like a bag of dirty laundry!

00:31.614 --> 00:36.453
Would someone please call the ASPCA?
'Cause this is animal cruelty!

00:36.536 --> 00:39.873
Excuse me! Excuse me!
You can't go up there. Oh! Hey, it's you.

00:40.248 --> 00:41.082
Hey.

00:41.166 --> 00:44.044
[Bash] Edna Rosenblatt just hammering
on the Wolf.

00:44.794 --> 00:50.341
Boy, oh, boy, this is a classic example
of nature versus nursing home!

00:50.800 --> 00:53.845
Russell!
Let's turn on the audience, all right?

00:54.929 --> 00:57.974
Phil, stay put.
I'm liking that frame up here.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.392
-[Keith] Two!
-[Sheila grunts]

00:59.476 --> 01:01.978
Hey, find me some energized faces,
will you?

01:02.062 --> 01:03.980
-[wrestlers grunting]
-[Keith] Oh, come on.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.899
Ooh. Keep trying.

01:05.982 --> 01:07.859
You know you're supposed to lose, right?

01:07.942 --> 01:10.653
-I'll only go when it's my time!
-It's your time.

01:10.737 --> 01:11.821
[shouts]

01:11.905 --> 01:14.074
-[Bash] And she's up again!
-[Dawn shouts]

01:14.157 --> 01:15.158
Whoa!

01:15.241 --> 01:17.285
Why is this match not over?

01:19.245 --> 01:20.997
What? I'm working.

01:21.498 --> 01:22.874
I can't find my house key.

01:22.957 --> 01:24.834
In the jacket, on the chair.

01:25.627 --> 01:27.504
[Bash] And she's down again!

01:27.587 --> 01:29.714
-One, two, three!
-[Bash] And she's staying down.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.801
That's it, ladies and gentlemen,
the Biddies win!

01:32.884 --> 01:36.054
-It's a victory for the old and aged!
-[yells]

01:36.137 --> 01:41.309
One final glimmer of glory
before they're both six feet under!

01:41.935 --> 01:42.852
Finally.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.897
Are you ever coming home for dinner?
'Cause there's no food in the house.

01:46.314 --> 01:48.108
Just take 50 out of the wallet.

01:48.233 --> 01:51.402
That's a lot.
Guess I'll use the extra on drugs.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.532
Um,
I wanted to make sure Justine found you.

01:56.407 --> 01:59.119
Oh! [chuckles] I guess she did.

01:59.202 --> 02:02.580
What is it about live taping
that you women don't understand?

02:02.956 --> 02:05.834
[Bash] ...the moment
you've all been waiting for.

02:07.585 --> 02:10.964
So, since I'm not wrestling,
do you want me to do anything?

02:11.047 --> 02:13.675
Why don't you just assume
that I don't need anything,

02:13.800 --> 02:16.678
and that I don't want to see you, okay?

02:17.262 --> 02:18.972
-Mm-hmm.
-[Bash] Up next,

02:19.055 --> 02:22.016
the match of the century! And the show's--

02:22.225 --> 02:23.268
Hey, sir! Hey!

02:23.351 --> 02:27.355
Whoa! The show's not over!
Have a seat, you old-timer!

02:27.647 --> 02:28.648
Cool!

02:30.233 --> 02:33.236
[Russell] Is it just me,
or is this show dragging hairy ass?

02:33.319 --> 02:34.904
It's harder than it looks.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.699
It'd probably be a lot better
if he put his best wrestler in

02:37.782 --> 02:41.077
instead of punishing her for making
that boss-as-hell title sequence.

02:41.452 --> 02:45.540
[Bash] And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the moment you've all been waiting for.

02:45.999 --> 02:50.211
She's a mother and a fighter,
a true red-blooded American hero.

02:50.503 --> 02:53.965
-The beautiful Liberty Belle!
-[audience cheers]

02:56.342 --> 02:58.094
[Debbie exclaims]

03:03.349 --> 03:05.351
[rock music playing]

03:07.896 --> 03:12.066
<i>Liberty Belle, how does it feel knowing</i>
<i>that you won the crown fair and square,</i>

03:12.150 --> 03:14.652
<i>only to have it stolen</i>
<i>by the Welfare Queen?</i>

03:14.736 --> 03:18.698
[Debbie] <i>We do not work in this country</i>
<i>to see all the spoils go to freeloaders!</i>

03:18.781 --> 03:20.700
<i>If Welfare Queen wants the crown,</i>

03:20.783 --> 03:23.453
<i>she's gonna have to fight me for it</i>
<i>in a real match!</i>

03:23.536 --> 03:26.748
Does she have better lighting than us
now that she's a producer?

03:26.831 --> 03:29.751
No, that's just the internal glow
that comes from power.

03:30.501 --> 03:33.004
-[lively music playing]
<i>-Buy yourself something pretty, baby!</i>

03:33.087 --> 03:35.965
-[laughing]
-[Tammé, on TV] <i>Yeah, wake up, stupid!</i>

03:37.300 --> 03:39.344
<i>Smartest thing you could ever do!</i>

03:39.427 --> 03:42.263
-[smacks lips]
-[all laughing]

03:42.764 --> 03:45.850
I think the set looks way better on TV
than it does in person.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.228
[Tammé] <i>Ha! Do you know what it's like?</i>

03:48.311 --> 03:51.522
<i>Ah! Real American royalty!</i>

03:52.565 --> 03:54.400
[Bash] <i>Are you ready?</i>

03:54.525 --> 03:57.278
<i>Looks like Welfare Queen isn't fighting</i>
<i>anyone today!</i>

03:57.362 --> 03:59.822
Look, I'm sorry you're being punished
for my mistake.

04:01.115 --> 04:01.950
With Sam.

04:02.992 --> 04:06.955
He's angry, and I think that's why
you had to fight Beirut this week

04:07.038 --> 04:07.914
instead of Zoya.

04:07.997 --> 04:10.500
No, no. That's not why.
Liberty Belle already vanquished Zoya.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.210
Now she's chasing Welfare Queen.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.296
You're not the center of the story, Ruth.

04:16.089 --> 04:16.923
Right.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.926
Well,
I think the episode turned out great.

04:20.593 --> 04:21.761
Do you think Sam liked it?

04:22.011 --> 04:24.013
Thursday's show dragged.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.140
-[blows a raspberry]
-Matches were too long.

04:26.224 --> 04:28.893
When I cut away to the audience,
it looked like they'd just eaten

04:28.977 --> 04:31.145
-a big Thanksgiving dinner.
-Sam, sorry to interrupt.

04:31.229 --> 04:34.107
Should I sit with the girls in case
you have any notes for the announcer?

04:34.190 --> 04:35.650
Or do you want me to stay with you?

04:36.859 --> 04:37.694
What?

04:38.152 --> 04:40.154
I'll just stay up here with you. Carry on.

04:40.697 --> 04:41.656
Okay. So...

04:42.407 --> 04:46.411
from here on out, instead of shooting
five bloated matches

04:46.494 --> 04:49.038
that I have to Frankenstein together
in editing,

04:49.122 --> 04:50.832
we're just gonna film three.

04:51.416 --> 04:55.545
So you'll audition matches for me
the Wednesday before the show,

04:55.753 --> 04:58.548
and I will pick the best three matches.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.093
Wait, so we're not all gonna be
on TV every week?

05:02.552 --> 05:03.386
Correct.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.472
That was Bash's idea.
He thought you could use the incentive.

05:06.556 --> 05:09.809
Right. Yes. Uh, originally,
my idea was gonna be a cash bonus,

05:09.892 --> 05:11.811
but then I looked into it,
and we can't afford it.

05:11.894 --> 05:15.189
But then Sam said, "You know what else
is a great incentive? Fear."

05:16.816 --> 05:18.735
No, competition. I said "competition."

05:18.818 --> 05:20.611
Yes, you did. Uh, classic mistake.

05:20.695 --> 05:24.699
I love competition. Thins out the herd,
encourages innovation...

05:24.782 --> 05:29.954
Great. All right, so these are the matches
I want to see at this week's auditions:

05:30.413 --> 05:32.498
All right, Welfare Queen, still ducking.

05:32.999 --> 05:34.959
Britannica versus Sheila.

05:35.543 --> 05:37.670
All right? Beirut versus Machu.

05:38.629 --> 05:40.882
-Liberty Belle versus Fortune Cookie,
-Yeah!

05:41.215 --> 05:43.509
and Biddies versus Melrose.

05:43.593 --> 05:46.596
Ooh, goody! Youth versus decrepitude!

05:46.763 --> 05:48.765
-Define youth.
-Not you!

05:49.265 --> 05:50.850
Sam. Sam.

05:50.933 --> 05:52.018
Yeah?

05:52.101 --> 05:53.311
Uh, what about me?

05:54.354 --> 05:58.024
Oh, yeah. Uh... Zoya versus Junkchain.

06:00.234 --> 06:01.069
Yolanda?

06:02.278 --> 06:04.989
She just started training.
She doesn't know any moves.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.200
She had moves when I saw her.

06:07.283 --> 06:11.120
Yeah, right, I got those kind of moves,
but with wrestling, I'm like level one.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.331
Yeah, but you know,
between your can-do spirit

06:13.414 --> 06:17.251
and her "will do anything" spirit,
I think you'll figure something out.

06:17.335 --> 06:20.505
And, you know, Carmen's always here
for help with the technical stuff.

06:20.588 --> 06:23.383
All right? All right, let the games begin!

06:23.466 --> 06:24.759
Carmen, can I get a session?

06:24.842 --> 06:25.885
-Second dibs.
-Third.

06:25.968 --> 06:28.471
That's not fair.
You two are in the same match,

06:28.554 --> 06:30.098
and Yolanda and I need the most help.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.975
It's not a needs-based system.
it's a dibs-based system.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.769
Sorry. Dibs is law.

06:36.562 --> 06:37.397
See you later.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.067
I think that went well. Hey, Sam,
I've been meaning to ask you.

06:41.150 --> 06:42.985
-What do you think about a team dog?
-No.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.237
-How about a ferret?
-No.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.572
Hey! The next time you boys have
a production meeting,

06:46.656 --> 06:48.157
you want to include all the producers?

06:48.241 --> 06:50.034
What production meeting? We had drinks.

06:50.118 --> 06:53.579
Yeah, we would have invited you,
but someone had to go home to their baby.

06:53.663 --> 06:55.373
[both laugh]

06:55.456 --> 06:58.418
Okay, well,
next time, tell me that there's a meeting,

06:58.501 --> 06:59.961
and I won't go home.

07:00.044 --> 07:03.548
Look, we've got six days to figure out
all these matches, rehearse 'em,

07:03.673 --> 07:07.343
film 'em, edit them, put them on the air,
before the whole process begins again.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.262
I don't have time to brush my teeth,

07:09.345 --> 07:12.432
let alone check in with you every time
I need to make something happen.

07:12.515 --> 07:16.018
Okay, well, what about this?
I'll make dinner tonight.

07:16.227 --> 07:18.271
We'll get a bunch of bourbon,
and you boys come over,

07:18.354 --> 07:20.022
and we'll all go over the show
for the week.

07:22.984 --> 07:24.610
Uh, I can't.

07:24.694 --> 07:25.570
I've got a kid.

07:26.237 --> 07:27.905
You're referring to the 16-year-old

07:27.989 --> 07:30.116
you're letting run wild
around Los Angeles?

07:31.367 --> 07:33.744
[chuckling] Oh, my God.
That's clearly a priority.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.746
Eight o'clock. She can find babysitting.

07:37.832 --> 07:39.250
[Rhonda grunting]

07:39.417 --> 07:40.376
What are you doing?

07:41.836 --> 07:45.006
I'm making a suicide vest
to blow myself up.

07:46.048 --> 07:46.883
For the show.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.092
That's my concept.

07:48.342 --> 07:49.677
Kill Beirut, who I hate.

07:51.012 --> 07:51.846
But then,

07:52.263 --> 07:53.431
out from the smoke,

07:53.973 --> 07:55.558
a new character arises.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.185
Phoenix!

07:57.643 --> 08:00.730
She'll have, like,
red and yellow face paint

08:00.813 --> 08:03.900
and these red and yellow streaks
coming out of her hair.

08:03.983 --> 08:05.943
She'll be like a living flame.

08:06.569 --> 08:07.487
Nimble.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.530
Seductive.

08:09.947 --> 08:11.240
Ethnically neutral.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.618
I hope Sam says yes
so I can make that costume.

08:13.701 --> 08:14.952
That sounds rad.

08:15.036 --> 08:16.037
Yeah, totally rad.

08:16.579 --> 08:17.497
Thanks.

08:19.081 --> 08:20.458
What are you guys gonna do?

08:20.541 --> 08:21.584
Oh, we don't know yet.

08:24.545 --> 08:26.797
-How about you guys?
-Don't tell her anything!

08:29.425 --> 08:33.387
When I was audience coordinator
for <i>Family Feud,</i> we'd crank up the AC.

08:33.888 --> 08:35.097
That wakes them up good.

08:36.557 --> 08:38.434
I wonder if this place even has AC.

08:39.143 --> 08:43.814
Hmm. Also, you'd have to make sure
the girls don't get too... nippley

08:44.065 --> 08:45.900
-Right. Nipples. [chuckles]
-[door opens]

08:46.275 --> 08:48.569
Okay. Bash, I will see you tonight.

08:48.819 --> 08:51.030
I am going to make fondue.

08:51.531 --> 08:55.326
And, um, I gave Sam the address,
in case you guys want to carpool.

08:55.701 --> 08:57.245
And, uh, just bring your appetite.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.497
Carpool, yes! I've read about that.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.290
Oh, we're having a team dinner!

09:02.083 --> 09:03.167
Good idea!

09:03.251 --> 09:04.377
To boost morale!

09:04.460 --> 09:06.671
No, sorry.
It's just directors and producers only,

09:06.754 --> 09:09.423
but, Tammé, I would love that, next time.

09:11.342 --> 09:12.802
Is it the chairs?

09:13.636 --> 09:15.054
Are they too comfortable?

09:17.014 --> 09:19.433
So, how long would it take
for me to learn that thing

09:19.517 --> 09:21.644
where I bend backwards
and smash you on the mat?

09:22.270 --> 09:23.104
A suplex?

09:24.313 --> 09:26.607
-A long time.
-[sighs]

09:28.192 --> 09:30.945
We're not gonna get on the show
through wrestling alone.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.948
-[sighs]
-What if I wear a string bikini?

09:34.031 --> 09:37.410
Mm! [chuckles]
No! I would never ask you to do that.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.245
You finally left that life.

09:39.328 --> 09:42.873
Your job is doing G-rated girl-on-girl
in a one-piece.

09:43.165 --> 09:45.001
Okay? You're not far from "that life."

09:45.251 --> 09:47.169
[scoffs] I'm not a stripper.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.254
Oh, neither am I.

09:49.505 --> 09:52.550
Full-time. Just once a week,
when my ex bartends.

09:52.633 --> 09:55.428
[chuckles] I like to torture her
by taking my clothes off.

09:56.512 --> 09:57.680
You like girls?

09:58.806 --> 09:59.640
I love girls.

10:01.475 --> 10:03.352
Cool. Uh, does Sam know?

10:03.436 --> 10:05.479
Does he need to know
about our personal life?

10:05.563 --> 10:07.565
Does Sam know
about you and that camera guy?

10:08.107 --> 10:09.191
What? Russell?

10:09.942 --> 10:11.152
I'm not fucking Russell.

10:12.111 --> 10:12.945
Wait, what?

10:13.237 --> 10:15.865

-Oh, we're gonna be stars of the show!
-Hey!

21:51.893 --> 21:54.271
The transformation gimmick.
That was my idea.

21:54.646 --> 21:56.898
I'm sorry, we just couldn't be
old ladies anymore.

21:57.065 --> 21:58.817
It was weighing on our self-esteem.

21:59.359 --> 22:00.527
But you'll do fine!

22:09.578 --> 22:10.537
[Sheila] We don't have a gimmick.

22:10.620 --> 22:13.498
We just want this to be about pure,
technical wrestling.

22:14.958 --> 22:18.754
So, does any of that technical wrestling
have something to do with a...

22:18.837 --> 22:20.630
shop window male mannequin?

22:20.797 --> 22:23.008
Oh, no. This is just Thomas.

22:23.216 --> 22:24.051
He's my lover.

22:24.843 --> 22:27.679
Yeah, I made him out of spare parts
after a real man broke my heart.

22:30.223 --> 22:31.558

Are you gonna engage

22:56.083 --> 22:59.836
-with the mannequin at all, or...
-Engaged? [chuckles]

23:00.212 --> 23:02.172

23:04.549 --> 23:05.717

I blow up.

23:29.324 --> 23:33.870
All right. You know, we've already got
a thing where someone magically changes

23:33.954 --> 23:35.580
into another thing.

23:36.039 --> 23:37.791
So... what else you got?

23:40.168 --> 23:43.422
I didn't really have that much extra time
this week 'cause I was...

23:43.505 --> 23:45.173
helping the rest of the girls, but...

23:45.257 --> 23:47.884
What if we reveal we're sisters?
Or ghosts?

23:47.968 --> 23:49.511
All right, so you have nothing.

23:49.594 --> 23:50.429
We have that.

23:50.512 --> 23:51.847
We can speak French.

23:52.055 --> 23:53.223
Okay. Next.

23:53.890 --> 23:56.601
But thank you for your time.
Thank you for your vulnerability.

-Okay.

23:58.437 --> 23:59.729

23:59.855 --> 24:02.190
That crazy Russian's been
chasing me everywhere.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.943
She wants to fight me,
but I don't want to fight tonight.

24:05.026 --> 24:05.986
I got plans.

24:06.653 --> 24:08.947
[in Russian accent] Oh... You!

24:09.990 --> 24:13.076
Why will you not accept
the challenge of Zoya?

24:13.577 --> 24:16.246
[Yolanda] Man, first of all,
I don't even know you.

24:16.329 --> 24:19.583
Second, tonight, I was gonna go down
to Beat Street.

24:20.375 --> 24:23.295
Oh! Beat Street?

24:23.753 --> 24:25.088

24:25.380 --> 24:27.257
Come on, you know! Beat Street!

24:27.632 --> 24:29.634

24:31.636 --> 24:35.765
Oh! You mean American ghetto dancing!

24:35.849 --> 24:39.686
I have always wanted to try this,
but in Soviet Union,

24:39.769 --> 24:41.480
only ballet is permitted.

24:42.105 --> 24:45.734
And being fresh is punishable crime.

24:46.568 --> 24:48.612
[Yolanda] Well, lucky for you,

Yes, Sam, I know it wasn't real wrestling.

But you were the one who said
you wanted to break up the repetition

27:18.094 --> 27:21.222

keep the energy flowing.

27:28.063 --> 27:29.856
No. I'm not putting Ruth in.

27:29.939 --> 27:31.941
Why?
Because you're not done punishing her?

27:32.817 --> 27:34.778
She's good.
Otherwise, you would have fired her

27:34.861 --> 27:37.072
and not Reggie. And this is me,
giving Ruth a complement.

28:06.851 --> 28:08.561
It will not be my intention...

28:08.645 --> 28:10.397
I can still cut you from the match.

28:11.481 --> 28:13.358
I could just run Yolanda's side.

28:13.441 --> 28:14.442
Just her dancing.

28:14.901 --> 28:17.362

of a Christmas log.
