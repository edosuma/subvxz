00:19.880 --> 00:21.480
You killed my brother.

00:22.480 --> 00:25.760
-I didn't, I didn't...
-I see you move that body.

00:25.840 --> 00:29.320
You thought it was Hassan in the taxi,
so you killed him.

00:30.480 --> 00:31.680
I didn't.

00:32.720 --> 00:34.800
I'm not going to hurt you
if I get a confession.

00:34.880 --> 00:39.080
He said, "The police is different here,
you can trust most of them."

00:39.160 --> 00:41.000
-So, I'm doing it his way.

00:41.080 --> 00:42.240
Talk!

00:42.320 --> 00:44.440
I didn't kill your brother.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.120
Okay.

00:51.520 --> 00:52.680
Okay.

01:03.680 --> 01:04.800
No.

01:06.160 --> 01:07.440
No!

01:08.200 --> 01:09.400
No! No!

01:14.000 --> 01:16.280
I said I wouldn't hurt you,
if I got a confession.

01:19.880 --> 01:20.960
Talk!

01:22.880 --> 01:25.800
I didn't kill anyone, I moved...

01:27.480 --> 01:29.040
I moved a body.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.640
I moved Grace's body.

01:32.680 --> 01:34.920
-But I didn't kill anyone.
-You liar!

01:35.640 --> 01:37.640
You killed Hassan!

01:38.600 --> 01:41.320
You killed Hassan!
You killed Hassan.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.240
You're late.

03:31.320 --> 03:32.440
Bad night.

03:32.520 --> 03:34.000
Like I Laura, I'm fine!

03:36.440 --> 03:39.000
Okay. Then, go and join Rav
in the interview room.

03:39.080 --> 03:40.880
-Yes.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.080
Carol Fincher.

03:54.240 --> 03:56.040
<i>Sorry.</i>

04:02.760 --> 04:05.640
Carol. She was in your AA group.

04:06.440 --> 04:08.840
Yeah. Yeah, she was.

04:08.920 --> 04:12.280
You had traces of alcohol in your blood
when we brought you in.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.240
Yeah, I, erm...

04:16.320 --> 04:18.880
-I had a small relapse.

04:18.960 --> 04:20.600
'Cause I hate London.

04:20.680 --> 04:24.040
All right, so you didn't drink to forget
killing an innocent little girl.

04:24.120 --> 04:25.880
Hey, I didn't do it!

04:29.960 --> 04:31.320
Oh...

04:33.960 --> 04:36.160
I haven't done anything.

04:36.240 --> 04:39.360
I haven't done anything.
What can I say to make you believe that?

04:44.440 --> 04:45.640
Walter Davies.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.040
Who's he?

04:49.120 --> 04:51.080
He's the father of the man

04:51.160 --> 04:53.720
you and Matthew rented
an apartment from in Norwich. You dropped a key card
at his house, didn't you?

04:58.800 --> 05:00.000
No?

05:01.120 --> 05:03.480
Liz Harper,

05:03.560 --> 05:04.800
Benjamin Williams, Grace Gibson...

05:07.040 --> 05:08.120
Beth Bachan,

05:08.200 --> 05:09.480
May.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.240
I don't think it's him.

05:44.280 --> 05:47.800
Well, we've got his DNA,
there's evidence at his house

05:47.880 --> 05:49.160
and he hasn't got any alibis.

05:49.240 --> 05:51.880
Our man's a methodical,
cold-blooded killer.

05:51.960 --> 05:54.160
Yann doesn't fit that profile.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.560
He could've faked the panic attack.

05:56.640 --> 05:58.200
Mmm-mmm, he didn't.

05:58.280 --> 05:59.280
If you're good at faking it,

05:59.360 --> 06:00.400
it's very hard to tell the difference.

06:02.360 --> 06:03.360
Nothing.

06:03.440 --> 06:05.720
The DNA from his hair...

06:06.760 --> 06:08.000
was in the hand of a murder victim.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.480
I know.

06:11.760 --> 06:13.240
Have you got the forensic report on that?

06:13.320 --> 06:15.320
Er, yeah.

06:16.880 --> 06:17.920
Thank you.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.480
<i>You're saying</i>
<i>Andrew Barnes was murdered?</i>

06:30.560 --> 06:32.480
It seems like it, yes.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.640
That's, er, terrible.

06:34.720 --> 06:35.960
But what's it got to do with us?

06:36.040 --> 06:37.640
You did business with him, didn't you?

06:37.720 --> 06:40.200
Yes, he was the head
of the planning committee in Lambeth.  And he was about to shut down
one of your projects, wasn't he?

06:42.840 --> 06:44.920
Nothing.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
I'm just saying that
if you made a list of all the companies

06:47.080 --> 06:48.560
-that might benefit from Barnes' death...

06:48.640 --> 06:51.880
DTG Construction
would be number one, I'd say.

06:51.960 --> 06:54.400
We had a new plan for Lambeth.

06:54.480 --> 06:57.400
Henry and Jason put together
a proposal that would have saved it.

06:57.480 --> 06:59.480
Backland.  Our Head of Legal.

07:01.640 --> 07:03.080
Wait, he was fired, wasn't he?

07:04.640 --> 07:06.120
If there isn't anything else...

07:06.200 --> 07:08.160
Not for the moment, no.

07:08.240 --> 07:11.320
And if there is, please go through
our legal department next time.

07:11.400 --> 07:12.880
Hmm.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.520
What's this?

07:34.600 --> 07:35.800
You tell me.

07:38.920 --> 07:41.600
"Fifteen grand.
I'll be in touch."

07:43.120 --> 07:44.840
What

07:44.920 --> 07:47.080
You think I'm blackmailing you?

07:48.200 --> 07:50.560
Why would I do that? I can't use it
without incriminating myself.

07:50.640 --> 07:51.720
Then, who sent it?

07:53.080 --> 07:54.320
It doesn't matter.

07:54.400 --> 07:57.560
It's just you giving me an envelope.
What are they gonna do with that?

07:59.040 --> 08:00.360
-Nothing.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.320
It's useless. Forget about it.

08:05.040 --> 08:07.280
It's useless,
unless somebody knows what you did.

08:07.360 --> 08:09.480
Nobody knows.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.240
What?

08:37.160 --> 08:38.400
Nothing.

08:54.280 --> 08:56.240
Hold on. Have you got anything?

08:57.640 --> 08:58.840
What's going on?

08:58.920 --> 09:01.280
What are you doing here?
Has something happened to Yann?

09:01.360 --> 09:03.080
-He's absolutely fine.

09:03.160 --> 09:04.280
This is our home.

09:04.360 --> 09:05.800
What are you doing here?
Where is he?

09:05.880 --> 09:07.200
Mr Neil.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.480
Can we have a word with you
down at the station, please?

09:10.920 --> 09:12.120
Yeah.

09:25.280 --> 09:28.280
So, Matthew,
I just wanted to ask, have you...

09:29.040 --> 09:31.400
have you noticed
anything strange about Yann lately?

09:31.480 --> 09:33.040
Like anything.

09:33.120 --> 09:34.760
I mean,
has he been acting differently?

09:34.840 --> 09:35.840
No.

09:35.920 --> 09:37.320
Er, what are you holding him for? How much does Yann know
about your work?

09:39.640 --> 09:40.840
He knows what I do.

09:40.920 --> 09:42.760
And we talk like normal couples, why?

09:42.840 --> 09:44.920
Well, does he know enough
to get in to a computer?

09:45.000 --> 09:46.160
Like Mrs Shaw's, for example.

09:49.800 --> 09:52.440
That was for a murder investigation.
Is that why you're asking me about him?

09:53.360 --> 09:55.400
Have you seen any of these before?

09:55.480 --> 09:58.760
Insulation tape, cable ties.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.120
Er... okay.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.080
Erm...  is he here?
I have to see him.

10:02.160 --> 10:03.400
So you have no idea
how these got into your home?

10:03.480 --> 10:04.640
No, I don't.

10:04.720 --> 10:07.640
Well, do the names
Liz Harper, Benjamin Williams,

10:07.720 --> 10:11.760
Grace Gibson and Beth Bachan
mean anything to you?

10:15.360 --> 10:16.360
No.

10:16.440 --> 10:17.960
Grace obviously does.
She was my best friend's sister.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.080
Sure.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.720
But none of the others?

10:20.800 --> 10:23.160
And you've never heard
Yann talking about them?

10:23.240 --> 10:24.320
Can I see him?

10:24.400 --> 10:27.120
I'm afraid you can't,
but you can help us...

10:27.680 --> 10:28.800
with our investigation.

10:29.680 --> 10:32.680
If you can let us know your whereabouts
on those dates there.

10:34.640 --> 10:35.880
Er...

11:00.920 --> 11:02.360
Mark?
-Yeah.

11:02.440 --> 11:04.240
Can you do me a favour?

11:04.320 --> 11:05.880
-Sure, anything.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.640
-Hang on.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.080
-Thanks.

11:12.160 --> 11:13.480
You said "anything."

11:24.080 --> 11:25.080
Hi, darling.

11:25.160 --> 11:26.960
Hi, Mum.
Where do you and Dad want to sit?

11:27.040 --> 11:28.160
<i>Sit when, honey?</i>

11:28.240 --> 11:30.800
-Tonight. The talent show.
<i>-Erm...</i>

11:30.880 --> 11:32.280
<i>-Don't say you forgot.</i>
-Erm...

11:32.360 --> 11:35.840
No, of course I didn't.
Erm, it's for eight o'clock, right?

11:38.480 --> 11:40.360
I don't mind,
sit us wherever you want to, darling.

11:40.440 --> 11:41.440
<i>Okay.</i>

11:41.520 --> 11:43.040
I love you, I can't wait.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.800
<i>-Bye.</i>
-Bye-bye.

11:59.880 --> 12:02.240
I'm investigating
the death of Andrew Barnes.

12:03.480 --> 12:07.200
Sylvie Gibson says you were involved
in saving something called the, er...

12:08.120 --> 12:09.960
the Lambeth project.
Is that right?

12:10.960 --> 12:12.960
The committee felt
that we broke our agreement.

12:13.040 --> 12:15.720
Henry Gibson and I
came up with a solution.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.360
Will it be approved this time?
Without Barnes?

12:18.440 --> 12:19.760
I don't know.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.840
Because if it is approved,
then one could say that...

12:22.920 --> 12:25.960
you really benefit
from Andrew Barnes' death.

12:26.040 --> 12:28.320
One could say that, yes, but...

12:28.400 --> 12:30.200
wasn't he depressed
and killed himself?

12:34.760 --> 12:36.520
Weren't you fired from DTG?

12:36.600 --> 12:38.000
Who told you that?

12:38.880 --> 12:39.880
Marcella.

12:42.520 --> 12:44.120
This is all about her, isn't it?

12:44.720 --> 12:46.400
What is?

12:46.480 --> 12:49.760
DTG have over 800 employees.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.960
Are you going to talk to
each and every one of them like this?

12:53.040 --> 12:54.520
No.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.200
Good, you're here.

13:00.400 --> 13:03.520
We've decided to send your new proposal
for Lambeth to the planning committee.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.680
Will you arrange that?

13:05.760 --> 13:07.200
Absolutely.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.120
I'm glad you've finally realised
it's the best way forward.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.720
It's not...
but we're forced to use it.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.600
Andrew Barnes was murdered.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.240
He was against the original plan.

13:16.320 --> 13:17.360
Murdered?

13:17.440 --> 13:20.280
If it went through now,
it might raise...

13:20.360 --> 13:22.960
unnecessary questions with the public.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.680
Sure, yeah.
No, I'll send the new plans along.

13:25.760 --> 13:26.760
Good.

13:26.840 --> 13:30.440
-Henry, just do it.

13:30.520 --> 13:32.840
You don't think he had anything
to do with it, do you

13:32.920 --> 13:33.920
With what?

13:35.000 --> 13:36.280
The murder?

13:36.360 --> 13:38.400
Don't be silly.

13:38.480 --> 13:39.960
He was desperate
to get his job back.

13:40.040 --> 13:42.840
He said working with me was Plan B,
perhaps this was his Plan A.

13:42.920 --> 13:46.280
God, you really
don't want him here, do you?

13:46.360 --> 13:47.640
Forget it.

13:54.160 --> 13:55.720
Jason's a climber.

13:56.800 --> 13:59.400
You said yourself,
he'd do anything for this company.

14:10.960 --> 14:13.240
<i>Yeah?</i>
-They know he was killed.

14:14.360 --> 14:16.200
<i>Who knows?</i>

14:16.280 --> 14:18.920
The police.
This is a murder investigation now.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.880
All right, just calm down.

14:20.960 --> 14:24.240
<i>-I think I should pay.</i>
-No, don't panic.

14:24.320 --> 14:25.600
<i>Look, I need this to go away.</i>

14:31.200 --> 14:33.960
If that's what you want,
but let me handle it.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.800
<i></i>
-Yes.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.160
Tonight?

14:37.240 --> 14:38.360
Okay.

14:44.600 --> 14:45.720
Bendek!

14:50.000 --> 14:53.400
-We need to talk business.
-Sure.

15:03.760 --> 15:05.720
If it's gonna take more than a minute,
it's gonna have to wait.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.960
I've got a case
involving DTG Construction.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.400
I think we should share information.

15:09.480 --> 15:12.480
-A fake suicide.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.360
Should your case be mine?

15:14.440 --> 15:15.560
I don't think
they're connected in that way.

15:15.640 --> 15:17.120
They just involve the same family.

15:17.800 --> 15:18.920
The Gibsons.

15:19.560 --> 15:22.040
And, possibly, Jason Backland.

15:24.440 --> 15:26.560
I guess the superintendent
will have to wait.

15:41.720 --> 15:44.040
Well?

15:44.120 --> 15:45.480
Yes, considerably more.

15:45.560 --> 15:47.320
Right, I need pictures of all of them.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.640
Absolutely.

15:55.080 --> 15:56.080
Thanks, Mark.

15:56.160 --> 15:59.840
Okay, so this is the hair
that we found in Beth's hand.

15:59.920 --> 16:02.800
And this is hair that I pulled
from Mark's head earlier on today.

16:02.880 --> 16:03.960
She did. It hurt.

16:04.040 --> 16:05.880
And, as you can see,

16:05.960 --> 16:09.960
there's only two roots
from the hair in Beth's hand

16:10.040 --> 16:13.840
and yet almost every single hair
I pulled from Mark's head has a root.

16:13.920 --> 16:16.480
Erm, and this is hair from my hairbrush.

16:16.560 --> 16:19.080
Are you seeing the similarities?

16:22.360 --> 16:25.080
I don't think that the hair
that we found in Beth's hand

16:25.160 --> 16:27.720
was pulled... from the killer's head.

16:27.800 --> 16:29.320
She could have grabbed hold
of his hoodie or something.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.960
-Got hold of it that way--
-I think it was planted.

16:36.280 --> 16:38.480
You know, Marcella,
when we find DNA at a crime scene,

16:38.560 --> 16:39.880
it usually means
that person's been there.

16:39.960 --> 16:42.320
What if it was planted? What if...

16:43.240 --> 16:44.960
I mean,
who's got access to Yann's hair?

16:45.040 --> 16:46.400
-His barber.
Matthew Neil.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
Yes, hers is better.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.760
But why would he try and frame
his own boyfriend?

16:53.840 --> 16:55.440
I don't know,
but I don't think it's Yann.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.120
I get everything about this, Marcella.
This is my investigation.

17:01.200 --> 17:02.520
Right, well, I think
we should bring him in.

17:02.600 --> 17:04.680
We can, and we probably will.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.480
But we've already spoken to him today.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.720
And you let him go?

17:09.920 --> 17:11.560
He's not a suspect.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.280
Hi.

17:34.960 --> 17:36.000
The police have Yann. What What for?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.280
They think he's got something
to do with the murders.

17:41.800 --> 17:42.920
Grace?

17:44.360 --> 17:46.400
But they're wrong.

18:29.320 --> 18:30.720
Mum!

18:30.800 --> 18:31.920
Hey.

18:33.360 --> 18:35.200
Hello, gorgeous. Mmm.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.560
Let me look at you. Wow!

18:38.000 --> 18:39.360
-Not really,

18:39.440 --> 18:41.120
just for the rings trick.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.400
Hey.

18:43.440 --> 18:45.040
Are you not doing anything?

18:45.120 --> 18:46.240
Are you kidding?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.200
Are you sure about this?

18:54.000 --> 18:55.320
Yes, I'm sure.

18:56.240 --> 18:58.560
I can't have that picture
down with the police.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.800
I do this and it's over, right?

19:01.440 --> 19:02.720
I'll make sure it is.

19:02.800 --> 19:03.840
Good evening.

19:03.920 --> 19:07.840
If everybody would like
to take their seats, please. Welcome.

19:07.920 --> 19:09.600
Where's Dad?

19:09.680 --> 19:11.440
Come on, let's go in.

19:20.080 --> 19:21.520
You got me into this situation.

19:23.520 --> 19:24.800
And I'll get you out of it.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.800
Here it is.

19:46.880 --> 19:49.200
I've already taken my half,
as arranged.

19:57.960 --> 19:59.560
It's all there,
don't you trust me?

20:03.960 --> 20:06.320
It ends here, Bendek.
Do you hear me?

20:07.240 --> 20:08.560
No more blackmail.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.920
-I mean it.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.080
The next time he wants help...

20:16.000 --> 20:17.080
he might not come to me.

20:25.680 --> 20:27.840
<i>♪ And spaces between us</i>

20:27.920 --> 20:33.120
<i>♪ You have come to show you, go on</i>

20:35.720 --> 20:40.160
<i>-♪ Near, far</i>

20:40.240 --> 20:43.920
<i>♪ Wherever you are</i>

20:44.000 --> 20:49.480
<i>♪ I believe that the heart does go on... ♪</i>

20:50.440 --> 20:51.920
Hey, what happened?
Why are you not here?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.960
What

20:54.040 --> 20:55.520
-The talent show.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.560
Oh, shit!

20:57.640 --> 20:59.160
I completely forgot.

20:59.240 --> 21:00.400
I'll explain it to Edward later.

21:00.480 --> 21:02.120
Quick! I've to go back in.
What do you want?

21:02.200 --> 21:03.360
Listen, erm...

21:03.440 --> 21:05.800
did you tell Tim that I was fired?

21:06.640 --> 21:08.680
Erm, I don't know, might have.

21:08.760 --> 21:10.040
Why?

21:10.120 --> 21:11.440
<i>Do you speak to him a lot?</i>

21:12.400 --> 21:14.080
Is that seriously why you called me?

21:14.160 --> 21:16.280
Well, do you?
He was at our house.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.640
<i>I didn't know you two were so close.</i>

21:19.760 --> 21:22.240
Bye-bye, Jason.

21:44.480 --> 21:46.480
That was so good.
I'm so proud of you.

21:46.560 --> 21:47.960
You missed the start.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.320
And why didn't Dad come?

21:49.400 --> 21:51.280
You'll have to ask him about that.

21:51.360 --> 21:52.480
Why can't we ask you?

21:53.520 --> 21:56.560
He loves us, so I guess
he didn't want to be here with you.

21:56.640 --> 21:58.600
-No, that's not why.
Tell us why.

21:58.680 --> 22:00.120
Why aren't you together any more?

22:00.200 --> 22:02.480
-I didn't do anything.

22:02.560 --> 22:04.200
Except ruin everything.

22:04.280 --> 22:07.560
Emma, why do you always think
that everything is my fault?

22:07.640 --> 22:09.600
Because you've always acted so weird.

22:09.680 --> 22:10.960
Well...

22:13.120 --> 22:14.800
Do you really want to know
why your father's not here? Shall I tell you
why your father is not here?

22:16.640 --> 22:18.040
Yes.

22:19.320 --> 22:21.600
Your Dad's not here
because he was having an affair, for three years, with another woman.

22:24.040 --> 22:25.160
And then, he left me.

22:26.520 --> 22:29.920
And I acted weird because I was depressed
because I'd lost my baby.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.640
It was not a choice.

22:35.400 --> 22:36.440
I'm sorry.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.840
I'm sorry, I...

22:44.920 --> 22:47.400
Mum, Mum...

22:48.680 --> 22:49.960
I'm sorry.
-God.

23:26.680 --> 23:27.720
Hey.

23:28.640 --> 23:31.480
Listen... sorry I missed it.

23:32.440 --> 23:34.280
Yeah, Edward was really disappointed.

23:34.360 --> 23:35.440
What are you doing here?

23:38.960 --> 23:42.200
I was in my car,
on my way home, and I still...

23:43.200 --> 23:44.840
I still think of this as home.

23:45.760 --> 23:47.320
And what do you want?

23:49.600 --> 23:51.480
I don't know.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.000
I just know
I need something good in my life.

23:53.080 --> 23:56.040
We had something good,
and you threw it away.

23:56.120 --> 23:58.080
Look, three nights ago,
you came to me--

23:58.160 --> 24:00.000
Old habit,
it won't happen again.

24:02.360 --> 24:04.080
I told the kids about Grace.

24:09.040 --> 24:10.080
What did you do that for?

24:10.160 --> 24:13.080
Because I was sick of them
blaming me for everything, that's why.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.720
So now, you're gonna
turn the kids against me?

24:14.800 --> 24:16.600
No, I would never do that.
They think the world of you.

24:18.640 --> 24:20.560
When we're with the kids,
we'll be a family,

24:20.640 --> 24:22.240
and when it's just us...

24:24.600 --> 24:26.160
we're nothing.

24:33.160 --> 24:34.840
I want you to give me the key.

24:35.840 --> 24:37.480
No, I still own this house.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.040
Just give me the key.

24:39.760 --> 24:40.880
What, so you can give it to Tim?

24:40.960 --> 24:43.600
Just give me the fucking key!

25:39.520 --> 25:40.920
It's rather late.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.760
Don't you worry.
This is not gonna take long at all.

25:48.080 --> 25:52.360
Can you explain why you stole a key card
from a Premier Lodge reception?

25:53.360 --> 25:57.240
No, no, I can't.
I can't explain the... the DNA,

25:57.320 --> 25:59.240
the stuff you found in my flat.

25:59.320 --> 26:00.520
Anything, all right?

26:01.720 --> 26:04.480
Can I just go back to my cell, please?
I'm really tired.

26:04.560 --> 26:06.120
All right, Yann.

26:06.200 --> 26:08.320
Have a look at this.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.840
This... is a photograph

26:11.920 --> 26:13.960
from said Premier Lodge.

26:14.560 --> 26:17.880
And this here...
is an item of clothing

26:17.960 --> 26:19.200
taken from your home.

26:19.280 --> 26:21.480
Now, if you look at this stitching here.

26:21.560 --> 26:23.040
This repair, yeah?

26:50.120 --> 26:53.040
This is not...
This is not mine.

26:54.080 --> 26:55.320
This is...

26:56.720 --> 26:58.600
This is not me.

26:58.680 --> 26:59.760
This is Matthew's.

27:02.280 --> 27:04.280
You're looking for Matthew. -That's Matthew Neil.
Yeah.

27:32.080 --> 27:34.160
It was his hoodie on the CCTV
at Premier Lodge.

27:34.240 --> 27:35.280
We can't get hold of him.

27:36.680 --> 27:39.680
His phone's switched off.
No match on his car with ANPR.

27:39.760 --> 27:41.200
Okay, thanks a lot.

27:41.280 --> 27:44.320
And the unit we sent to his house
says he's not there.

27:44.400 --> 27:45.680
Work?

27:45.760 --> 27:46.760
He has his own company,

27:46.840 --> 27:48.800
but he works part-time
at DTG Construction.

27:48.880 --> 27:50.240
I asked them to call us,
if he shows up.

27:52.840 --> 27:55.520
He was involved
in the 2005 investigation as well.

27:55.600 --> 27:57.840
-You're fucking kidding me!

27:57.920 --> 27:59.760
No, look.

28:01.400 --> 28:04.360
He wasn't a suspect.
He lived next door to one of the victims.

28:04.440 --> 28:05.840
So, how was he involved?

28:05.920 --> 28:10.320
He was helping the police
see if the victim had anything missing.

28:10.400 --> 28:11.960
So he knows about the trophies.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.600
Sorry, I'm failing to understand this.

28:16.680 --> 28:17.920
Why didn't you tell us this earlier?

28:18.000 --> 28:19.280
We've been talking about him for days.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.960
Er, because I recognised the face,
Rav, I didn't recognise the name.

28:22.040 --> 28:23.960
He's in the case file
for anyone to find.

28:24.040 --> 28:26.400
-We need to talk to him.
-The job he's got at DTG,

28:26.480 --> 28:28.400
his best friend got him it,
Henry Gibson.

28:28.480 --> 28:31.080
Yeah, they spent a lot of time together.
Yann sounded kind of jealous.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.920
He might know
where to find Matthew.

28:34.280 --> 28:35.320
Do we know where Gibson is?

28:36.240 --> 28:37.320
No?

28:37.400 --> 28:39.120
Okay, let's find out, please.

29:14.080 --> 29:16.120
-The door was open.

29:16.200 --> 29:17.320
Right.

29:17.400 --> 29:19.040
That doesn't mean
you can just walk in, though, does it?

29:29.360 --> 29:31.560
So, when was the last time
you saw Matthew?

29:32.320 --> 29:34.760
Matthew?
He was here yesterday.

29:36.640 --> 29:37.800
What did he want?

29:37.880 --> 29:40.560
Well, he was very upset.
You just arrested his partner.

29:40.640 --> 29:42.520
You really think
Yann had something to do with it all?

29:42.600 --> 29:45.040
-Yeah, we can't talk about that.
-No, of course not.

29:46.880 --> 29:49.720
Is this you and Matthew?
Yeah.

29:49.800 --> 29:51.360
Football camp when we were nine.

29:51.440 --> 29:54.360
We grew up together.
He's basically my brother.

29:54.440 --> 29:55.640
So you see a lot of each other?

29:55.720 --> 29:58.080
Yeah. Yeah, well,
especially now he's back in London.

29:58.160 --> 29:59.920
I helped him
set up his business here.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.000
When was that?

30:01.600 --> 30:03.360
About four months ago.

30:06.400 --> 30:08.680
If he's not at work and he's not at home,
where might he be?

30:10.480 --> 30:11.520
Sorry, what's going on?

30:11.600 --> 30:13.440
Did he say where he was going,
when he left here?

30:13.520 --> 30:16.960
Well, he wasn't allowed to see Yann
and he didn't want to go home, so...

30:18.360 --> 30:20.280
-He said he was going away for a bit.

30:24.360 --> 30:26.480
<i>Yeah, just on his own.</i>

30:26.560 --> 30:28.640
Just to try and process all of this,
I think.

30:34.680 --> 30:36.120
If he contacts you,
you call me immediately,

30:36.200 --> 30:37.520
brother or no brother, yeah?

30:37.600 --> 30:39.040
<i>Well, of course.</i>

30:43.800 --> 30:45.280
<i>Whatever it is</i>
<i>you think he's done...</i>

30:45.360 --> 30:47.200
you're wrong.
-Thank you.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.560
Yeah, vehicle found.
Alpha four-seven-six,

30:51.640 --> 30:53.640
Golf, Golf, Whisky.

30:53.720 --> 30:54.960
<i>Status of vehicle?</i>

30:55.040 --> 30:56.160
Abandoned.

31:05.600 --> 31:06.680
Stuart?

31:07.880 --> 31:09.000
Hey.

31:11.520 --> 31:13.400
How was class?

31:13.480 --> 31:14.480
<i>Muy bien. Gracias.</i>

31:14.560 --> 31:15.600
Er...

31:17.520 --> 31:21.320
Do you want some tea?
-Oh, er, <i>si.</i> Pleas-o.

31:22.600 --> 31:24.360
How can you listen to that?

31:24.440 --> 31:26.000
-Yeah.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.080
Bendek! Bendek!

31:39.600 --> 31:40.680
Come on.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.480
Shit! Come on!

32:20.760 --> 32:21.920
Linda!

32:27.640 --> 32:30.160
-Oh, my God!
-Just turn that shit off.

32:30.240 --> 32:31.640
Okay.

32:34.200 --> 32:36.000
Call an ambulance.
-Yeah.

32:46.200 --> 32:48.440
Erm, ambulance service, please.

33:04.640 --> 33:07.600
I wouldn't bother. He's dead.

33:08.600 --> 33:11.600
Er, yeah, yeah.
Sorry, erm... Our lodger, erm...

33:11.680 --> 33:13.640
Yeah...

33:13.720 --> 33:15.760
Could you send
an ambulance, please?

33:20.080 --> 33:22.600
Right, we found Matthew Neil's car.
It's in Dover.

33:22.680 --> 33:24.280
We've informed Europol,
and the French are investigating

33:24.360 --> 33:25.800
if he arrived in Calais.

33:25.880 --> 33:26.880
And when will we know
if he did?

33:26.960 --> 33:29.760
Don't know, so we carry on
as if he's still in the country.

33:29.840 --> 33:32.440
His car's being towed to London
for a proper forensic analysis,

33:32.520 --> 33:35.440
but locals found this
in the glove compartment.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.080
-Mmm-hmm.

33:40.160 --> 33:42.160
May must've made it for her.

33:43.160 --> 33:46.920
I found two new connections
between our victims and Matthew Neil.

33:47.000 --> 33:48.360
Beth was a client of his.

33:49.320 --> 33:50.880
He said he'd never heard of her,
remember?

33:50.960 --> 33:52.240
Yeah.

33:52.320 --> 33:54.840
And Benjamin Williams
was his physiotherapist.

33:55.520 --> 33:57.440
Wait, why was he seeing a physio?

33:57.520 --> 34:00.800
I've got his medical records here.
He had herniated discs.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.880
Lumbar disc herniation.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.800
There's one, there's another.

34:06.880 --> 34:10.800
A man with these problems could barely
lift anything without extreme discomfort.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.080
And what if he does lift something heavy,
like a body?

34:17.160 --> 34:18.760
Out of the question, I'd say.

34:18.840 --> 34:20.880
But what happens if he does?

34:20.960 --> 34:23.880
Extreme pain.
Bedridden, or to say the least,

34:23.960 --> 34:26.680
severe difficulties moving.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.480
-Thanks.

34:43.600 --> 34:44.600
Hey.

34:46.640 --> 34:48.600
So that rules Matthew Neil out as well.

34:48.680 --> 34:52.000
I am just so fucking tired of this case!

34:54.160 --> 34:56.680
It doesn't mean
he didn't kill Grace Gibson.

34:56.760 --> 34:59.520
Then, what?
Someone else came and moved the body?

35:01.200 --> 35:03.120
Maybe.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.400
He's connected to the victims,
the car, the bracelet.

35:05.480 --> 35:06.840
Oh, yeah.

35:06.920 --> 35:08.040
He had the opportunity.

35:08.120 --> 35:11.040
You can't rule him out
because he's got a bad back.

35:36.920 --> 35:39.360
<i>I didn't kill anyone, I moved...</i>

35:39.440 --> 35:40.960
<i>I moved a body...</i>

35:42.920 --> 35:44.120
<i>Talk! You killed Hassan.</i>

35:45.440 --> 35:48.000
<i>I moved... a body. I didn't...</i>

35:49.120 --> 35:52.240
<i>I didn't kill anyone. But I did...</i>

36:36.600 --> 36:38.080
What happened in there?

36:38.160 --> 36:41.840
You know, er,
just a sex act gone wrong.

36:42.760 --> 36:43.920
No.

36:45.960 --> 36:47.520
I mean, with you.

36:49.280 --> 36:51.920
Stuart, is anything wrong?

36:54.480 --> 36:56.120
You have to tell me.

37:00.240 --> 37:01.520
I've got MS.

37:03.160 --> 37:05.520
It's early stages, but, you know...

37:08.520 --> 37:10.240
I can't provide for us any more.

37:11.280 --> 37:12.760
Why didn't you tell me?

37:12.840 --> 37:15.080
Because I'm supposed
to take care of you.

37:18.280 --> 37:20.360
We're supposed to take care
of each other.

37:21.120 --> 37:24.000
I've put some money aside, right,
but it's nowhere near enough.

37:24.080 --> 37:27.640
Shh. Don't worry about money,
we'll manage.

37:27.720 --> 37:30.600
And I've done
some really bad things to get it.

37:33.520 --> 37:35.040
What bad things?

37:37.000 --> 37:39.000
I'm sorry, Linda.

37:39.080 --> 37:40.800
But I do love you.

37:40.880 --> 37:42.400
Oh...

37:43.440 --> 37:44.640
I love you.

38:18.800 --> 38:21.560
Where is it?
Where is it

38:24.600 --> 38:25.640
Shit!

38:27.040 --> 38:29.080
-Good night.
-Hey, Laura.

38:29.160 --> 38:33.480
Sorry, do you remember Bendek Krol,
you know, with the key card?

38:33.560 --> 38:34.960
-Sure.
-He's dead.

38:35.040 --> 38:37.080
Autoerotic asphyxiation.

38:37.160 --> 38:39.480
He tied a leather belt to a door handle
or something.

38:39.560 --> 38:42.120
Is it really that much better without air?

38:44.520 --> 38:47.640
Anyway, because he figured
in our investigation, we got his stuff.

38:47.720 --> 38:49.840
-Yes. Very much so.

38:49.920 --> 38:51.880
This is his phone.

38:51.960 --> 38:53.200
They found 7.5 grand.

38:53.280 --> 38:55.200
But it looks like
he's blackmailed someone.

38:55.280 --> 38:56.640
Here.

38:56.720 --> 38:58.480
If you look at that picture there,

38:58.560 --> 39:01.840
those two guys were both
at Grace Gibson's funeral.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.240
Do you want me to look into it?

39:11.760 --> 39:13.360
No, I'll take it. Thanks.

39:25.200 --> 39:26.520
Found him yet?

39:26.600 --> 39:28.760
Sorry.

39:28.840 --> 39:30.360
Erm, no.

39:31.360 --> 39:32.760
Have you heard about Matthew Neil?

39:32.840 --> 39:35.480
That he couldn't have moved
Grace's body, yes.

39:35.560 --> 39:37.160
I still think it could be him.

39:37.240 --> 39:38.800
I know. Rav said.

39:38.880 --> 39:40.400
I want to stay on him.

39:42.960 --> 39:44.080
Okay.

39:49.080 --> 39:51.120
Well, I just wanted to say good night.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.560
Good night.

40:01.920 --> 40:05.160
Hi, Tim.

40:05.240 --> 40:07.600
Got something for you.

40:07.680 --> 40:09.680
Bendek Krol's mobile.

40:20.880 --> 40:22.520
Found the place all right?

40:23.520 --> 40:24.920
-Yes.
-Yep.

40:27.560 --> 40:30.400
-It's a beautiful house.
-Thank you.

40:30.480 --> 40:33.480
Yes, it's your, er...
it's your first time here, isn't it?

40:34.600 --> 40:36.120
Yes, it is.

40:36.200 --> 40:37.840
Well, hopefully not the last.

40:39.720 --> 40:41.440
Thank you.

40:41.520 --> 40:44.000
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

40:44.080 --> 40:45.640
I'm very glad you could come.

40:48.200 --> 40:50.560
Well, you said you had
something to show us?

40:52.160 --> 40:53.920
Yes, I do.

40:55.320 --> 40:56.600
Are you aware of Battersea?

40:56.680 --> 40:58.320
What about it?

40:58.400 --> 41:03.000
There's a very special plot of land
that the council are hoping to develop...

41:04.560 --> 41:06.880
All right... I'll just show you.

41:28.560 --> 41:31.840
-Mmm. New suspect.

41:31.920 --> 41:33.080
Oh, yeah?

41:36.800 --> 41:38.640
Why are you talking to Jason?

41:38.720 --> 41:43.240
DTG came up in an investigation,
he's head of legal.

41:43.320 --> 41:44.560
Again.

41:46.240 --> 41:49.160
-Mmm-mmm. No.

41:52.600 --> 41:55.400
You have any idea
why he, er, got his job back?

41:55.480 --> 41:58.520
Hmm. They probably realised
they couldn't do without him.

42:01.320 --> 42:02.440
And you?

42:06.320 --> 42:09.280
I've realised I can.

42:29.840 --> 42:31.640
Obviously, it's sustainable.

42:32.600 --> 42:35.400
But, more importantly,
it's a tribute to Grace.

42:36.560 --> 42:40.400
It's bold, elegant, forward-thinking.

42:42.400 --> 42:45.040
And it looks onto the river,
just like Dad always liked.

42:48.560 --> 42:50.720
I think it's beautiful.

42:59.880 --> 43:00.920
Sylvie?

43:04.840 --> 43:06.560
-I love it.

43:10.840 --> 43:11.880
Come here.

43:15.320 --> 43:16.480
Thank you.

43:20.680 --> 43:23.000
Wow, this is cause for celebration.

43:23.080 --> 43:24.600
You know, I have some--

43:24.680 --> 43:26.000
I have, erm...

43:26.080 --> 43:28.720
some nice champagne downstairs.
Let me, er...

43:28.800 --> 43:30.480
I'll be right back.
