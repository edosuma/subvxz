WEBVTT

00:04.659 --> 00:10.090
I thought everyone in Manhattan
getting spider powers was bad.

00:10.170 --> 00:12.260
But everyone
turning into spider-monsters?

00:12.330 --> 00:17.100
That's just... the "wurst."
[growling]

00:20.010 --> 00:21.860
[screeching] Not so fast.

00:23.270 --> 00:28.350
What's the beef, guys?
Looks like you need a time-out.

00:28.385 --> 00:29.689
Oh, great.

00:29.690 --> 00:32.570
[growling, screeching]

00:32.950 --> 00:35.984
Now this guy wants in
on the action. [growling]

00:37.210 --> 00:39.210
[screeches]

00:39.290 --> 00:43.210
- That'll hold ya! [Growling]
- This isn't working, Pete.

00:43.290 --> 00:45.050
At the speed this spider virus
is spreading,

00:45.130 --> 00:47.130
we can't just web these
monsters up one at a time.

00:47.200 --> 00:50.434
The city's gonna tear itself apart
before we make it past Midtown.

00:50.959 --> 00:53.630
Besides, everyone with these
spider powers is evolving.

00:53.710 --> 00:57.470
It's only a matter of time before
you hit monster stage as well.

00:57.550 --> 00:59.990
Uh, the second stage
probably progresses

01:00.070 --> 01:02.490
at different rates for different people.

01:02.570 --> 01:04.220
Guess I'm just lucky
I'm a late bloomer.

01:04.254 --> 01:06.240
Or that you're not Spider-Man.

01:06.310 --> 01:08.160
As the first person
with spider powers,

01:08.240 --> 01:09.870
he was probably also
the first to monster out.

01:09.890 --> 01:13.670
- I wonder which beast is him.
- Who knows?

01:13.750 --> 01:18.010
[quietly] But my real
question is, where's Miles?

01:18.080 --> 01:20.520
At times like this, you want your
friends and family close by.

01:20.590 --> 01:22.190
Speaking of which...

01:22.240 --> 01:26.570
I better check on Aunt May.
Maybe you should head back to Horizon.

01:26.580 --> 01:29.154
See if you can help Anya
find a cure for Gwen.

01:32.750 --> 01:34.520
No way. I'm going with you.

01:34.600 --> 01:38.250
I already lost track of my dad.
I'm not losing you too.

01:38.285 --> 01:39.885
Thanks, Harry.

01:47.850 --> 01:50.350
No sign of monsters.

01:50.385 --> 01:52.010
Maybe the outbreak
hasn't reached Queens yet?

01:52.030 --> 01:54.940
I hope you're right.

01:55.270 --> 01:59.120
<i>[Aunt May] Nice try, but you spiders
are no match for May Parker.</i>

01:59.200 --> 02:02.110
Oh, no! Aunt May!

02:02.145 --> 02:05.540
- Aunt May?
- Uh-oh.

02:05.610 --> 02:09.039
Peter? What's wrong, dear?

02:09.120 --> 02:11.640
Are you okay? I-I thought...

02:11.710 --> 02:15.380
Never could reach that corner.
Been bothering me for years.

02:15.460 --> 02:16.879
You have spider powers too?

02:16.880 --> 02:20.310
- Doesn't everyone?
- [Peter] Well, that's sort of the problem.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.979
Oh, don't be such a worrywart.

02:21.980 --> 02:25.470
The house hasn't been
this spotless in decades.

02:25.505 --> 02:27.630
Who knew this Spider-Man
was having so much fun?

02:27.640 --> 02:32.160
And I bet he keeps his room
a lot tidier than you, Peter.

02:32.230 --> 02:35.948
I wouldn't be so sure about that.
Listen, Aunt May,

02:35.983 --> 02:38.987
the problem is,
people are turning into these...

02:41.740 --> 02:45.590
[chittering] Aunt May?
Aunt May!

02:45.625 --> 02:50.191
You're turning into
one of those... monsters!

02:51.910 --> 02:55.302
<i><font color="cyan"> sync & correction by f1nc0

03:00.430 --> 03:02.440
[roaring] Aah!

03:02.520 --> 03:05.610
[grunting]

03:05.690 --> 03:09.190
Please, Aunt May!
[Grunting]

03:09.570 --> 03:12.790
I know I forget to take out
the trash sometimes, but...

03:12.860 --> 03:15.110
[grunts]
[screeching]

03:15.180 --> 03:17.290
It's no reason for you to eat us!
[grunts]

03:17.370 --> 03:21.520
[pants, grunts]

03:21.555 --> 03:25.680
How about we have some of
your famous wheat cakes instead?

03:26.200 --> 03:27.199
[screeches]
[both grunt]

03:27.700 --> 03:29.950
[grunts]

03:30.030 --> 03:33.880
[grunting] Uh-oh.
[Snarling]

03:33.960 --> 03:36.400
[Peter] I'd even prefer Aunt May's
steamed lima beans to this.

03:36.460 --> 03:39.807
First, my dad, Gwen...
Now Aunt May?

03:39.842 --> 03:42.862
This monster thing is seriously
hitting too close to home.

03:43.550 --> 03:46.150
[grunting]

03:46.230 --> 03:50.480
I hope Anya's having better
luck finding a cure. [Grunting]

03:50.550 --> 03:52.860
[Harry] I just hope we can stay in
one piece until she does.

03:52.890 --> 03:54.980
[Peter] Look out!
[gasps]

03:55.060 --> 03:56.890
Hey! Be careful, would ya?

03:56.925 --> 03:59.650
You think you're angry?
Whoa! Aah!

03:59.730 --> 04:02.910
Just wait until regular Aunt May hears
about you trashing her good china.

04:02.990 --> 04:04.579
[roaring]

04:04.580 --> 04:06.920
Aah! [Grunting]

04:06.990 --> 04:08.274
[roars]
[yells]

04:08.275 --> 04:11.510
[panting]
I got you, Pete!

04:11.590 --> 04:13.190
[both grunt]

04:13.260 --> 04:15.350
Whoa! [Grunts]

04:18.430 --> 04:20.860
Well, there goes
the neighborhood.

04:20.930 --> 04:22.690
[roars]
That's right, Aunt May.

04:22.770 --> 04:25.510
It's me, your Petey-poo.
[snickers]

04:25.590 --> 04:27.530
Don't even...
[Muffled chuckling]

04:27.610 --> 04:30.440
[chittering]

04:30.520 --> 04:32.089
What's going on?

04:32.090 --> 04:35.096
[chittering]

04:36.620 --> 04:39.360
Something I said?

04:39.430 --> 04:42.620
Whatever it was, something
sure got their attention...

04:42.700 --> 04:44.710
"Petey-poo."
[Beeps]

04:44.790 --> 04:46.477
Look. On my Spider-Tracker.

04:46.512 --> 04:48.783
The monsters are all converging
on one point.

04:48.818 --> 04:53.198
We better find out where these
guys are heading together, and fast.

04:56.970 --> 05:00.380
[Anya] Hmm?
Ugh!

05:00.460 --> 05:02.380
You're an aggressive
little virus, aren't you?

05:02.460 --> 05:04.060
[beeping]

05:06.130 --> 05:08.240
[scoffs] Voice mail again?

05:08.310 --> 05:12.630
What the heck, Miles? Where are you?
I'm starting to worry.

05:12.665 --> 05:16.905
I'm still at Horizon, and we really could
use your help with these equations.

05:16.940 --> 05:18.747
[roaring]

05:18.782 --> 05:20.420
Yeah, well, sorry,

05:20.490 --> 05:23.666
but you're not exactly the best
lab partner at the moment, Gwen.

05:23.701 --> 05:25.900
[thud]
[growling]

05:25.980 --> 05:28.500
But we are getting closer.

05:28.580 --> 05:30.500
I've isolated the mutation
in your bloodstream.

05:30.580 --> 05:33.105
[growling]

05:33.140 --> 05:36.491
What's that?
[chitters] Enzymes?

05:36.526 --> 05:39.004
Yeah.
That's actually a good idea.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.660
If I increase the ratio
to match your metabolic rate...

05:41.695 --> 05:43.768
[spider-monsters growling]

05:43.769 --> 05:45.842

05:53.770 --> 05:55.370
Whoa, girl!

05:56.860 --> 06:00.110
[roaring]
[screams]

06:00.145 --> 06:02.246
[grunts]

06:02.281 --> 06:05.520
Seriously? You just had to go
all Hulk on my samples?

06:05.555 --> 06:07.109
[roaring]

06:07.110 --> 06:09.280
Gwen, you put that down!

06:09.360 --> 06:11.554
That's my favorite
spectrophotometer!

06:12.040 --> 06:13.640
[screeches]

06:13.700 --> 06:16.704
[gasps] Uh-oh.

06:16.861 --> 06:19.690
It's clear my infection
is entering the monster phase.

06:19.720 --> 06:22.970
[grunting]

06:25.870 --> 06:27.710
Looks like I'll have to be
my own test subject.

06:28.470 --> 06:30.560
[groaning]

06:30.561 --> 06:33.553
[music]

06:34.640 --> 06:36.830
[chittering]

06:42.890 --> 06:44.740
[Harry] These guys sure are in a hurry.

06:44.820 --> 06:48.000
I wonder where they're...
The Oscorp building!

06:48.080 --> 06:50.510
[Peter] First, Norman-Monster goes AWOL,

06:50.580 --> 06:54.247
then the entire horde of
spider-monsters marches to Oscorp?

06:54.290 --> 06:57.760
- This can't be a coincidence.
- No way, Pete. It has to be.

06:57.795 --> 06:59.180
Think about it, Harry.

06:59.260 --> 07:03.500
Norman was the Stealth Spider.
He tried to poison the city.

07:03.580 --> 07:05.240
Now he's found some way
to control these monsters.

07:05.260 --> 07:09.111
Okay, I... I know you
have issues with my... Dad?

07:09.146 --> 07:11.010
[roaring]

07:11.090 --> 07:12.840
[spider-monsters screeching]

07:12.920 --> 07:14.850
[Norman-Spider vocalizing]
[screeching]

07:14.920 --> 07:17.090
[chittering]

07:17.125 --> 07:20.351
I hate to say I told you so,
but, dude,

07:20.386 --> 07:24.387
your dad is totally the Spider-King.

07:24.422 --> 07:28.037
[screeching, chittering]
[music]

07:28.072 --> 07:31.440
And I'm pretty sure he just
ordered his army to attack us.

07:31.475 --> 07:33.880
So I'm ordering us
to get out of here!

07:33.960 --> 07:36.585
[screeching]

07:39.210 --> 07:40.810
[grunts]

07:40.870 --> 07:42.129
[yells] Harry!
[Grunts]

07:42.130 --> 07:45.641
Webbing my web-shooter?
So not cool! [growling]

07:45.676 --> 07:50.549
[grunts] You know, you guys could
learn a thing or two from Spider-Man.

07:51.790 --> 07:53.980
He would never throw me
off a building!

07:54.050 --> 07:56.277
[screaming]

07:57.220 --> 07:59.820
[screaming]
[grunts]

07:59.890 --> 08:02.730
You like to play it
down to the wire, my friend.

08:02.800 --> 08:05.849
- Anya?
- Or should I say, "Down to the web"?

08:08.140 --> 08:11.538
[screeching] No hitchhikers!

08:13.485 --> 08:18.840
- Nice save, Anya.
- I swore you'd be a monster by now.

08:18.910 --> 08:20.489
I synthesized a serum
in the nick of time.

08:20.490 --> 08:22.079
It reversed my monster mutation.

08:22.080 --> 08:25.375
But when Gwen escaped,
she wrecked the remaining doses,

08:25.410 --> 08:27.750
and any chance of testing it on her.

08:27.830 --> 08:29.940
Fortunately, there was
still some serum left

08:30.020 --> 08:32.197
in the injector
after I used it on myself.

08:32.232 --> 08:34.830
Well, I know the perfect test
subject... the Spider-King.

08:34.840 --> 08:37.972
No! Harry, wait!

08:38.340 --> 08:40.450
That's the only vial
of cure we have.

08:40.530 --> 08:42.130
Let's think this through!
[grunts]

08:43.350 --> 08:44.849
[grunts]

08:44.850 --> 08:47.460
What are you doing?

08:47.530 --> 08:49.805
You said you'd help me
save my dad, Pete.

08:49.840 --> 08:52.200
Now I've got the chance, and
you don't want me to take it?

08:52.280 --> 08:54.460
Hey, enough!
[Grunts, groans]

08:54.540 --> 08:57.280
This isn't just about
the Osborns anymore, Harry.

08:57.360 --> 09:00.470
It's about the whole city!
We need a plan.

09:00.550 --> 09:03.030
I've got one!
You said it yourself, Pete.

09:03.065 --> 09:07.220
The way those monsters attacked us...
My dad can control them.

09:07.290 --> 09:11.200
Hold up. You're saying Norman's the
one in charge of the monster squad?

09:11.210 --> 09:13.710
It looked like Norman was
communicating with the monsters...

09:13.745 --> 09:15.560
right before
he sicced them on us.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.640
If we reverse my dad's mutation,

09:17.710 --> 09:19.710
maybe I can talk
some sense into him.

09:19.745 --> 09:23.084
Get him to rein those monsters in
until we can mass-produce

09:23.085 --> 09:25.343
- Anya's cure.
- That's a big "maybe."

09:25.378 --> 09:27.310
Plus there's no way of knowing
if Norman will still have

09:27.390 --> 09:30.000
a psychic link to the monsters
once he's not one.

09:30.080 --> 09:32.650
Are we sure this is the best plan?

09:32.730 --> 09:34.850
I'm afraid it's the only
plan at the moment.

09:34.885 --> 09:37.820
It'll work. I know you
don't trust my dad, Pete,

09:37.900 --> 09:40.840
but I'm asking you to trust me.

09:40.920 --> 09:43.830
Yeah.
But you're not doing it alone.

09:43.910 --> 09:48.020
- We're a team, remember?
- Hate to break up the bro-mance,

09:48.090 --> 09:51.599
but how did you plan on getting
close enough to inject Norman?

09:51.634 --> 09:54.554
Oscorp is literally crawling
with monsters. [chittering]

09:54.589 --> 09:57.684
We flush 'em away.

10:00.936 --> 10:05.259
[music]

10:05.260 --> 10:06.930
That's right.
Follow the leader.

10:06.965 --> 10:10.152
It's working!
They're all yours!

10:10.187 --> 10:13.913
Hey, have you guys heard the one
about the itsy-bitsy spider?

10:16.620 --> 10:20.050
Guess not, or we couldn't have
washed these spiders out.

10:20.130 --> 10:22.630
[roaring, screeching]

10:25.300 --> 10:27.300
- We don't have much time.
- You go.

10:27.370 --> 10:29.718
- I'll draw off the rest.
- Be careful.

10:29.753 --> 10:33.060
Please! These powers are
becoming second nature to me.

10:33.140 --> 10:35.380
[growling]
[Peter] Maybe we can get close

10:35.460 --> 10:37.380
to the Spider-King
without him seeing us.

10:37.460 --> 10:40.980
[roaring]

10:41.050 --> 10:44.040
So much for taking Norman
by surprise!

10:45.630 --> 10:49.070
- [Harry] Where is he off to?
- Looks like Norman wants his

10:49.071 --> 10:50.990
bodyguards to do the dirty work.

10:51.060 --> 10:53.470
[grunting]

10:53.480 --> 10:55.069
[screeching]

10:55.070 --> 10:56.069
[screeches]

10:56.070 --> 10:59.150
I'd call that
a pretty clean sweep.

10:59.185 --> 11:02.313
Osborn and Parker for the win!
[both laugh]

11:02.348 --> 11:03.570
All right!

11:03.650 --> 11:06.410
Let's cure your dad
and go... home?

11:06.490 --> 11:09.910
[Harry] Oh, man!
Looks more like a spider lair.

11:10.390 --> 11:12.420
[chittering]

11:12.490 --> 11:14.590
<i>[doors close]
[both] Huh?</i>

11:14.660 --> 11:16.270
Let's keep
Norman's little helpers

11:16.350 --> 11:20.045
outside for now, shall we?
[growling]

11:20.705 --> 11:23.853
- Ehh...
- [Peter] And a little extra won't hurt.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.340
[roaring]

11:26.375 --> 11:30.171
Come on, Norman. Be a good
boy and take your medicine.

11:30.172 --> 11:35.065
[music]

11:35.180 --> 11:38.397
Sorry, Dad.
This is for your own good.

11:39.350 --> 11:40.950
[growling]

11:41.870 --> 11:43.470
[grunts]

11:45.710 --> 11:49.075
Hey! Web for brains!

11:49.110 --> 11:52.256
How about you pick on
someone from your own genus?

11:52.291 --> 11:53.630
[roaring]

11:53.631 --> 11:56.722
[music]

11:57.960 --> 11:59.560
[grunts]

12:01.040 --> 12:02.970
[roars]

12:03.677 --> 12:05.174
Ugh!

12:05.550 --> 12:07.069
[screeching]

12:07.070 --> 12:09.421
Harry, now! [Grunting]

12:09.456 --> 12:09.809
[grunts]

12:09.810 --> 12:12.390
[grunts, yells]
[roars]

12:12.425 --> 12:13.924
[grunts]

12:13.925 --> 12:17.079
[grunting]

12:17.980 --> 12:21.800
[screeches, groans] Dad!

12:21.835 --> 12:23.560
[exhales]

12:23.570 --> 12:25.990
He's okay. Just sedated.

12:26.070 --> 12:29.070
But the change
should've occurred by now.

12:29.105 --> 12:32.256
And if our theory was correct, with
Norman unconscious,

12:32.350 --> 12:35.740
the monsters should've
stopped attacking. [clacking]

12:35.775 --> 12:38.430
[Harry] Great. Two failed theories.
[screeching]

12:38.500 --> 12:41.690
[gasps]
They've breached the glass!

12:42.580 --> 12:44.600
You know, I don't like
to use this word,

12:44.680 --> 12:47.208
but, man, these spiders
are a menace.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.760
[roaring]
[grunting]

12:50.795 --> 12:52.349
[screeching, roaring]

12:52.350 --> 12:55.690
Keep it up, uglies.
I can fight you all day. [Chittering]

12:55.760 --> 12:58.370
- Anya, stampede!
- Never mind.

12:58.450 --> 13:00.430
[Harry] Sorry. No monsters allowed.

13:00.440 --> 13:02.440
[thudding]
[growling]

13:02.475 --> 13:04.120
[Peter] That should buy us some time.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.997
[chittering]
[music]

13:07.030 --> 13:10.809
Above us!
[grunts]

13:11.280 --> 13:13.800
[grunting]

13:13.870 --> 13:16.003
Harry, we've got to
lead them away from Anya.

13:16.038 --> 13:18.560
They must still be
communicating with one another.

13:18.640 --> 13:21.210
If Norman's out cold,
then who's controlling them?

13:21.290 --> 13:24.197
<i>The one who's the smartest,
of course...</i>

13:24.232 --> 13:26.729
The Jackal!

13:27.650 --> 13:29.720
The Jackal!

13:29.800 --> 13:32.060
So Norman isn't the Spider-King.
[chittering]

13:32.130 --> 13:34.560
He's just another one
of your spider slaves.

13:34.640 --> 13:38.080
This was your plan all along,
wasn't it, Raymond?

13:38.160 --> 13:41.310
To get revenge?
To ruin my family?

13:41.345 --> 13:45.128
My home!
My city!

13:45.163 --> 13:50.310
While I'd love to say yes,
that's not exactly the case.

13:50.740 --> 13:53.717
Norman destroyed Midtown
and my clones.

13:53.752 --> 13:57.920
Even the spider serum
was vaporized by the explosion.

13:57.990 --> 14:00.600
But as luck would have it,
by going airborne,

14:00.680 --> 14:04.770
the entire city was exposed
to my serum. [screeching]

14:04.850 --> 14:09.431
So, no... things didn't
go according to plan.

14:09.466 --> 14:13.110
But thanks to your father,
the plan was improved.

14:13.190 --> 14:18.530
[chittering] A spider army,
eight million strong,

14:18.600 --> 14:22.308
and genetically programmed
to obey me!

14:22.343 --> 14:25.440
You won't get away with this!
[web shooter deploys]

14:25.475 --> 14:28.242
[grunting]
[Jackal laughing]

14:28.520 --> 14:31.360
But I already have.

14:31.395 --> 14:33.880
Just like your father,
you underestimate me.

14:33.950 --> 14:37.360
And now look.
I turned Norman into my slave.

14:37.370 --> 14:41.103
And I'll do the same to you.
[grunting]

14:42.370 --> 14:44.626
Not if I have
anything to say about it!

14:44.661 --> 14:49.630
- Dad?
- Norman? You should be under my control!

14:49.710 --> 14:53.210
The only person Norman Osborn
answers to...

14:53.245 --> 14:55.970
is Norman Osborn!

14:56.050 --> 14:59.740
You were better off dead, my friend.

14:59.810 --> 15:03.670
My death was liberating,
Raymond. [grunts]

15:03.740 --> 15:07.320
As you'll soon see!
[Roaring]

15:07.400 --> 15:09.910
[snarls]
[grunts]

15:09.990 --> 15:11.790
[both growling]

15:13.830 --> 15:16.250
[grunts]
[growling]

15:16.330 --> 15:18.680
[roaring]

15:18.760 --> 15:22.520
Can't help Norman with all these
monsters defending the Jackal.

15:22.590 --> 15:23.999
[grunts]
[spider-monster thuds]

15:24.000 --> 15:27.991
Come on! [Beeps]
I can't fight without my glider!

15:28.026 --> 15:30.920
[whirring]

15:30.955 --> 15:33.340
I've got ya, Harry!
[Grunting]

15:33.420 --> 15:38.130
- You are really good at this, Pete...
- Beginner's luck, I guess.

15:38.430 --> 15:41.280
[growling]

15:41.350 --> 15:44.610
Aah! [Groans]

15:44.690 --> 15:47.585
[labored breathing]

15:49.290 --> 15:52.460
Dad! So the serum
did have an effect.

15:52.530 --> 15:56.460
Don't tell me this was
your attempt at a cure, son,

15:56.495 --> 15:59.625
because I'm still cursed
with this hideous body.

15:59.660 --> 16:04.730
- Well, was it?
- Anya did her best, Dad.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.230
And, as always, Horizon's best

16:07.310 --> 16:09.970
is nowhere near the genius
of Oz Academy.

16:10.050 --> 16:12.120
Like the geniuses you hid
in your secret lab?

16:12.130 --> 16:14.240
Dreaming up ways
to neutralize Spider-Man?

16:14.310 --> 16:19.480
- I did nothing of the sort.
- No point denying it, Mr. Osborn,

16:19.560 --> 16:21.730
'cause whatever
you learned in that lab

16:21.800 --> 16:26.250
is probably our best chance of
curing the virus, curing you.

16:26.320 --> 16:30.070
[sighs]
We came close to a method

16:30.140 --> 16:32.330
that could feasibly
remove Spider-Man's powers,

16:32.400 --> 16:37.500
but without a sample of his
actual DNA, it proved useless.

16:37.580 --> 16:41.500
- What if we got Spider-Man's DNA?
- [scoffs] How?

16:41.580 --> 16:43.024
Nobody's seen him in days.

16:43.025 --> 16:46.010
He's probably one of
these monsters by now.

16:46.090 --> 16:48.600
And besides, everything
we created was destroyed

16:48.680 --> 16:50.963
when the Jackal
attacked Oz Academy.

16:52.830 --> 16:54.670
But we still have
what's left of Anya's serum.

16:54.705 --> 16:58.100
So, if we could mix her
degenerative monster formula

16:58.170 --> 16:59.359
with a sample of Spider-Man's DNA...

16:59.360 --> 17:05.759
- It could result in a cure.
- Harry, duck! [growls]

17:05.940 --> 17:10.520
Aah!
[groaning]

17:10.555 --> 17:13.373
[roaring]

17:13.700 --> 17:15.700
[grunting]

17:15.780 --> 17:18.020
[roaring]

17:18.030 --> 17:21.030
Uh, Pete?
[screeching]

17:21.065 --> 17:23.880
[both grunting]

17:27.200 --> 17:30.729
Get back here, Warren!
[Grunts]

17:31.210 --> 17:33.150
[cries out, grunts]

17:33.220 --> 17:35.674
[snarls]

17:35.709 --> 17:39.104
[grunts] Harry, we gotta go!
[screeching]

17:39.139 --> 17:42.810
[grunting]

17:42.880 --> 17:46.370
[growling, grunting]

17:46.371 --> 17:50.990
[music]
[groaning]

17:55.320 --> 17:57.490
[Harry] Dad!

17:57.570 --> 18:00.420
[straining]

18:00.490 --> 18:02.130
[grunts]

18:03.590 --> 18:07.780
[screaming]

18:09.080 --> 18:13.020
[labored breathing] Dad...
Dad, no.

18:13.100 --> 18:17.170
I'm losing him, Pete.
What are we gonna do?

18:17.250 --> 18:20.562
[groaning]
He'll die if we don't cure him.

18:20.597 --> 18:23.590
The only way he'll heal
is with Spider-Man's blood.

18:23.625 --> 18:25.225
And he's not here.

18:26.460 --> 18:32.876
[music]

18:38.620 --> 18:41.358
That's not true, Harry.

18:42.610 --> 18:46.404
Spider-Man is right here.

18:46.439 --> 18:49.280
He's been by your side
this whole time.

18:49.315 --> 18:52.755
What? [Stammers]
H-How?

18:52.790 --> 18:58.070
All this time, Pete, you...
you were Spider-Man?

18:58.140 --> 19:00.900
Why didn't you tell me?

19:00.980 --> 19:04.480
- I... I couldn't.
- You couldn't?

19:04.560 --> 19:08.560
Even when I suspected you were,
you couldn't tell me the truth?

19:08.640 --> 19:10.470
[groaning]
[gasps]

19:10.505 --> 19:15.791
I'm sorry, Harry.
I thought I was doing the right thing.

19:17.150 --> 19:19.240
[groaning continues]

19:22.170 --> 19:24.090
[thumping rapidly]

19:24.170 --> 19:25.770
[thumping slowing]

19:28.750 --> 19:32.500
[groans]
[Harry] Dad?

19:33.590 --> 19:35.190
Dad, you're alive!

19:38.520 --> 19:41.152
He's unconscious,
but he should be all right.

19:41.608 --> 19:46.260
[groaning] Anya!
Harry, give me a hand.

19:46.340 --> 19:50.010
You were a fool
to come here, Spider-Man,

19:50.045 --> 19:53.629
considering you're the key to it all.

19:55.440 --> 19:57.960
[grunts]

19:58.040 --> 19:59.609
[Spider-Man] Harry, get
everyone out of here!

19:59.610 --> 20:02.921
[Harry] I will.

20:04.690 --> 20:06.300
[both grunt]

20:06.380 --> 20:09.256
Go! Get them to safety!

20:09.291 --> 20:10.880
[grunting]

20:10.960 --> 20:13.512
I've got nothing
to do with you, Jackal!

20:13.547 --> 20:19.220
- Ugh!
- Don't be so naive, Spider-Man.

20:19.300 --> 20:22.889
You're the center of all this.

20:22.890 --> 20:28.287
I must confess, when you
arrived on the scene months ago,

20:28.322 --> 20:32.975
I feared Norman had used
my confiscated spider experiment

20:33.010 --> 20:36.047
to create his own spider army.

20:36.082 --> 20:39.124
But after witnessing you two fight,

20:39.159 --> 20:43.400
I realized you must have gotten
your powers some other way.

20:43.435 --> 20:48.540
Bitten by one of my babies
accidentally, perhaps?

20:48.575 --> 20:52.420
Oh, no!
You're right...

20:52.500 --> 20:54.260
The spider bite at Oscorp.

20:54.330 --> 20:57.506
It must've been part of
your experiment. [chittering]

20:57.541 --> 21:00.474
I am the first spider soldier.

21:00.509 --> 21:04.670
And only the blood of one
of the first spider soldiers

21:04.750 --> 21:07.750
could be used to create a cure.

21:07.760 --> 21:10.770
Which is why
you must be destroyed,

21:10.850 --> 21:14.543
along with the second
spider soldier.

21:14.578 --> 21:18.930
- Huh? Miles? No!
- Yes, Spider-Man.

21:18.965 --> 21:24.084
[grunting] He's sedated, secure,
and so not coming to your rescue.

21:25.360 --> 21:28.610
With the spider army
firmly under my command,

21:28.645 --> 21:35.955
New York belongs
to the Jackal! [Echoing]

21:36.974 --> 21:41.901
