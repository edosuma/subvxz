01:07.777 --> 01:09.017
- I hope so.

01:09.111 --> 01:10.069
This is the third night in a row

01:10.154 --> 01:12.187
I've had to stay past 9.

01:12.281 --> 01:15.157
I'm starting to forget
what my family looks like.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.617
Oh.

01:16.702 --> 01:17.534
Come on.

01:18.454 --> 01:20.028
Simone, he just emailed.

01:20.122 --> 01:22.197
He wants the title page changed
again.

01:23.167 --> 01:25.542
No, it's fine, I'll take
care of it in the morning.

01:25.669 --> 01:27.869
You get out of there and you go
home.

01:27.963 --> 01:30.506
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.309
No!

01:52.947 --> 01:54.113
Somebody help!

01:55.074 --> 01:56.406
Where's my phone?

02:00.162 --> 02:01.453
No, no!

02:01.539 --> 02:02.412
My keys...

02:03.749 --> 02:05.165
No!

02:05.251 --> 02:06.542
Oh no!

02:06.627 --> 02:08.585
Oh, no, leave me alone!

02:11.006 --> 02:12.798
Help, somebody help!

02:19.014 --> 02:19.847
- Open!

02:21.016 --> 02:22.090
Oh my gosh!

02:22.184 --> 02:23.225
- Simone.

02:23.310 --> 02:23.925
- What happened?

02:24.019 --> 02:25.269
- Simone.
- What happened?

02:25.396 --> 02:27.062
- There was a man...

02:28.107 --> 02:29.148
- Oh my gosh.

02:29.233 --> 02:31.984
You're okay, you're okay.

02:32.069 --> 02:33.777
There's nobody here.

02:35.197 --> 02:37.489
- There is someone following me.

02:39.410 --> 02:41.493
Someone in a mask, and...

02:43.539 --> 02:44.997
- Okay.

02:45.082 --> 02:45.956
It's okay.

02:49.336 --> 02:50.377
- Mrs. Curtis.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.629
Mrs. Curtis.

02:54.258 --> 02:55.340
Mrs. Curtis.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.628
Just a few more questions, okay?

02:59.722 --> 03:01.972
Did you happen to see
where your attacker went?

03:03.559 --> 03:06.801
- He ducked out of sight
when Simone showed up.

03:06.896 --> 03:08.228
She must've scared him off.

03:09.398 --> 03:10.639
- Well, he's lucky he ran,

03:10.733 --> 03:13.233
I would've smashed his face in.

03:13.319 --> 03:15.694
- And you're certain you
didn't see anything either?

03:15.779 --> 03:16.811
- No.

03:16.906 --> 03:20.157
We were both working
late on a presentation.

03:20.284 --> 03:21.983
I had left a few minutes after
Beth,

03:22.077 --> 03:23.485
but I heard her honking,

03:23.579 --> 03:24.328
so I went over to her car,

03:24.455 --> 03:25.621
but I didn't see anyone there.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.789
- And you can't remember
any distinguishing features?

03:27.875 --> 03:30.325
Any scars, marks, tattoos?

03:30.419 --> 03:31.168
- No.

03:31.295 --> 03:32.994
It was dark.

03:33.088 --> 03:36.498
He was wearing a mask,
so I didn't see much.

03:36.592 --> 03:37.257
- Okay, here's what I'm gonna
do.

03:37.343 --> 03:39.000
I'm gonna leave you my card.

03:39.094 --> 03:40.168
If you can remember anything,

03:40.262 --> 03:42.837
no matter how small or
unimportant it might seem,

03:42.932 --> 03:44.973
I want you to give us a call,
okay?

03:49.230 --> 03:51.012
- We'll do everything we
can to find this guy, okay?

03:51.106 --> 03:52.514
- Thank you, Detective.

03:52.608 --> 03:54.015
- Of course.

03:54.109 --> 03:55.108
- We'll be in touch.

03:57.821 --> 03:59.029
- Do you want me to stay?

03:59.156 --> 04:01.198
- Oh, no, I'm fine.

04:02.743 --> 04:03.867
- Are you sure?

04:03.994 --> 04:05.527
I'm the queen of couch surfing.

04:06.789 --> 04:07.579
- I'm okay.

04:08.499 --> 04:09.197
- Of course.

04:09.291 --> 04:10.365
Love you.

04:10.459 --> 04:11.333
- Love you.

04:16.548 --> 04:18.039
- Can I get you anything?

04:18.133 --> 04:19.132
Some tea maybe?

04:21.303 --> 04:22.043
- Yeah.

04:22.137 --> 04:22.719
- Okay.

04:22.846 --> 04:24.054
Some camomile coming up.

04:24.181 --> 04:25.389
- That'd be perfect.

04:25.516 --> 04:27.182
- Be right back.

04:43.117 --> 04:44.366
- Someone help!

04:46.078 --> 04:46.743
No!

04:56.672 --> 04:58.505
- What is all this?

04:58.590 --> 04:59.748
- Oh.

04:59.842 --> 05:00.749
Thought I'd try something other
than

05:00.843 --> 05:02.917
a granola bar for breakfast for
a change.

05:03.012 --> 05:04.469
- Honey, you don't have to do
that.

05:04.555 --> 05:05.420
- Do what?

05:05.514 --> 05:07.088
- Pretend like everything is
normal.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.424
That was a pretty scary night
last night.

05:09.518 --> 05:10.258
- I know.

05:10.352 --> 05:11.727
I was there, Nick.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.812
But I'm just trying to move
forward now.

05:15.566 --> 05:16.732
- Look, why don't I call into
work,

05:16.817 --> 05:20.068
and maybe you, me, and Jess
can spend the day together.

05:20.154 --> 05:21.028
- No.

05:21.113 --> 05:23.447
I don't want everyone knowing
about it.

05:23.574 --> 05:25.774
- Beth, that's gonna be rough.

05:25.868 --> 05:26.608
- Look.

05:26.702 --> 05:28.276
Jess takes her SAT next week,

05:28.370 --> 05:29.995
and I don't want her to be
distracted.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.446
- We can't keep a lid on this.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.281
- Keep a lid on what?

05:33.375 --> 05:34.449
- The frying pan.

05:35.377 --> 05:36.626
- Oh.

05:36.754 --> 05:38.628
Well, we should get a new one.

05:38.756 --> 05:39.755
- Yeah, we should.

05:41.175 --> 05:42.624
There you go.
- Wow!

05:42.718 --> 05:43.759
What gives?

05:43.844 --> 05:45.126
- Nothing gives.

05:45.220 --> 05:46.511
Just eat it.

05:46.597 --> 05:48.630
- Uh, hey, can I borrow 5 bucks?

05:48.724 --> 05:51.466
Carmen and I want to study
at Phil's Diner after school.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.352
- I don't think that's a good
idea.

05:53.437 --> 05:54.803
- We always study at the diner.

05:54.897 --> 05:56.063
- Well, not today.

05:56.148 --> 05:57.972
We want you to come home.

05:58.067 --> 06:00.192
- Mom, I thought we were over
this.

06:00.277 --> 06:01.976
- We are over this.

06:02.071 --> 06:03.945
But I still want you to come
home straight after school.

06:04.031 --> 06:04.988
- Mom.

06:05.115 --> 06:06.114
- End of discussion.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.482
- Dad?

06:07.576 --> 06:08.784
- Do what your mom says.

06:10.079 --> 06:10.744
- Fine.

06:11.747 --> 06:13.372
- Hey, where are you going?

06:13.457 --> 06:14.539
- To school.

06:14.625 --> 06:15.990
Or is that not allowed either?

06:16.085 --> 06:17.918
- Have your father drive you.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.962
- You know, helicopter
parenting is a pejorative term.

06:21.048 --> 06:21.880
- Hey!

06:23.092 --> 06:24.499
I love you.

06:24.593 --> 06:26.301
- I'll see you later.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.727
- Right, thank you.

06:39.566 --> 06:40.849
- Hey, hey, hey!

06:40.943 --> 06:42.109
- Trevor.

06:42.194 --> 06:42.859
What's going on?

06:42.986 --> 06:43.944
- I'm just checking up on you.

06:44.029 --> 06:45.153
How you doin'?

06:45.239 --> 06:46.238
- Best I can.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.907
- Nick, you know things
have been a little tight

06:48.992 --> 06:50.525
since we lost the Bowlen
account.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.360
- I noticed the coffee's gotten
worse.

06:52.454 --> 06:55.372
- Bowlen took hundreds of
billable hours with him.

06:55.499 --> 06:57.198
We're gonna have to make some
cutbacks.

06:57.292 --> 06:58.166
- Cutbacks?

06:58.252 --> 06:59.584
- Layoffs, downsizing, cleaning
house,

06:59.670 --> 07:00.961
whatever you want to call it.

07:01.046 --> 07:02.921
It is not gonna be fun, pal.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.040
- Should I be worried?

07:06.135 --> 07:06.967
- Listen.

07:07.052 --> 07:08.376
We're gonna keep this quiet for
now,

07:08.470 --> 07:10.378
but I want to give you a head's
up.

07:10.472 --> 07:12.380
You have been doing great work.

07:12.474 --> 07:16.226
However, your billables are
down.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.563
- Yeah, I mean, there hasn't
been a whole lot of clients.

07:19.690 --> 07:20.889
- I understand that, but we're
gonna make

07:20.983 --> 07:25.110
all our decisions from here on
out based solely on revenue.

07:26.071 --> 07:26.945
- I need to make it rain.

07:27.030 --> 07:30.574
- You need to make it storm,
hurricane.

07:40.752 --> 07:41.585
- Beth.

07:43.297 --> 07:44.129
Beth.

07:45.215 --> 07:46.089
Hey, Beth.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.250
Are you okay?

07:49.344 --> 07:50.677
- I'm fine.

07:50.762 --> 07:51.970
Why?

07:52.055 --> 07:52.971
- Well, usually you answer
within

07:53.056 --> 07:55.849
the first 5 or 6 times I call
your name.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.142
- Sorry.

07:57.227 --> 07:57.809
- What's up with you?

07:57.895 --> 07:59.853
What are you doing here?

07:59.938 --> 08:01.763
- Greg needed the changes
on the title page,

08:01.857 --> 08:03.899
and there was an error
in one of the tables.

08:03.984 --> 08:04.941
- Beth, come on.

08:06.445 --> 08:09.821
- I just really need the
distraction right now.

08:09.907 --> 08:11.740
- I get that, I do.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.659
Have you thought about talking
to someone?

08:14.745 --> 08:15.443
- I'm talking to you.

08:15.537 --> 08:17.412
- Oh, you know what I mean.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.115
You've gone through a
traumatizing experience.

08:21.210 --> 08:24.211
There's no shame in trying to
get some help processing it.

08:25.339 --> 08:27.255
I know Dr. Ellis has some
openings right now and-

08:27.341 --> 08:28.924
- No, I'm fine, Simone.

08:29.885 --> 08:30.675
- Beth.

08:30.761 --> 08:31.960
You really need to get some
help.

08:32.054 --> 08:34.554
- No, what I need is to
finish this before lunch.

08:38.060 --> 08:39.267
- Okay.

09:18.433 --> 09:19.507
- Thanks, Charlie.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.434
I'll see you tomorrow.

10:15.991 --> 10:16.898
- Sweetie.

10:16.992 --> 10:18.199
Aw, baby.

10:18.285 --> 10:19.159
- Mom?

10:27.628 --> 10:29.077
Why didn't you tell me?

10:29.171 --> 10:30.545
- I didn't want to scare you.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.547
You've got your SAT coming up
next week,

10:32.633 --> 10:34.966
and that's what you need to be
focused on.

10:36.178 --> 10:39.754
- But Mom, I'm not 6 years old
anymore.

10:39.848 --> 10:42.724
If something like this happens
to you, then I should know.

10:42.809 --> 10:43.975
- I should've told you.

10:45.270 --> 10:46.102
- So, what now?

10:46.229 --> 10:48.021
- Well, the police are searching
for him,

10:48.106 --> 10:50.932
and apparently he's attacked
several women

10:51.026 --> 10:52.484
over the last few weeks.

10:53.570 --> 10:54.819
- Well, what if he comes here?

10:54.905 --> 10:55.770
- No.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.405
He doesn't know where we live,
Jess.

10:57.491 --> 10:58.490
We're safe here.

10:58.575 --> 11:01.076
- You didn't seem to
think that this afternoon.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.494
- I'm sorry I scared you.

11:03.622 --> 11:06.039
It's just, I'm still working
through this.

11:08.085 --> 11:09.959
- You know, maybe you
should talk to someone.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.129
- Maybe.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.015
Oh.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.968
Dr. Ellis?

11:27.062 --> 11:27.977
- Sorry, no.

11:29.231 --> 11:32.107
Let me guess, it's your
first time at therapy,

11:32.192 --> 11:33.808
you don't want to be here,

11:33.902 --> 11:35.819
you're wondering if you
can bolt for the door

11:35.946 --> 11:37.195
before anyone sees you.

11:39.741 --> 11:41.741
Don't worry, it's completely
natural.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.203
Would you like to come wait in
my office?

11:45.288 --> 11:47.247
- Oh, no, thank you.

11:48.250 --> 11:49.157
- You sure?

11:49.251 --> 11:50.375
I have fresh coffee.

11:51.253 --> 11:51.993
- Well...

11:52.087 --> 11:54.662
When you put it like that, sure.

11:54.756 --> 11:55.663
- All right.

11:55.757 --> 11:56.381
Follow me.

12:00.095 --> 12:01.553
That must've been terrifying.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.472
- I guess so.

12:04.558 --> 12:05.515
- You guess so?

12:06.810 --> 12:11.521
Well, it sounds like you're
afraid to own your feelings.

12:12.441 --> 12:14.315
- Nothing really happened.

12:15.277 --> 12:16.359
I didn't get hurt.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.446
Some of the other women, I mean,

12:20.282 --> 12:22.190
it could've been much worse.

12:22.284 --> 12:25.326
- So, you feel like you don't
deserve to have a reaction?

12:28.165 --> 12:30.623
Beth, it's just you and me in
here.

12:30.709 --> 12:33.918
Whatever reaction you're
having, it's legitimate.

12:35.005 --> 12:37.756
Somebody tried to hurt you.

12:37.841 --> 12:39.591
It's okay to have a reaction.

12:42.137 --> 12:44.137
- I just, I feel like I keep
going

12:44.222 --> 12:46.014
over and over it in my head.

12:47.225 --> 12:49.383
Did I do something wrong?

12:49.478 --> 12:51.352
Did I do something to deserve
this?

12:51.438 --> 12:54.689
I mean, I know, it sounds
horrible.

12:54.775 --> 12:55.899
- No, there's no horrible.

12:56.026 --> 12:57.734
That's just the way you feel.

12:58.862 --> 12:59.861
- I feel terrified.

13:01.782 --> 13:04.398
I feel like he could be
waiting around every corner.

13:04.493 --> 13:08.703
If I let my guard down for
just one second, he could...

13:10.791 --> 13:12.165
- Beth, you can say it.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.794
- He could finish what he
started.

13:17.547 --> 13:18.922
- You know, if you like,

13:20.050 --> 13:21.582
you and I could work together

13:21.676 --> 13:25.470
maybe to help you not
feel like this anymore.

13:27.557 --> 13:29.423
- But, Dr. Ellis, I-

13:29.518 --> 13:30.558
- It's up to you.

13:31.645 --> 13:33.645
I'm sure that Dr. Ellis
could help you too.

13:35.524 --> 13:38.149
- If I could, I could work with
you?

13:39.778 --> 13:40.610
- Yes.

13:43.782 --> 13:45.240
- Okay.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.366
Yeah, I think so.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.079
Thank you for the coffee.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.205
- Mm, of course.

13:54.918 --> 13:58.953
- Licensed marriage and family
therapist.

13:59.047 --> 14:00.788
Specializing in cognitive
behavior-

14:00.882 --> 14:02.090
- Hey.

14:02.175 --> 14:02.966
- Hi.

14:03.093 --> 14:04.342
- How'd it go with
Ellis?

14:04.427 --> 14:06.636
- Actually, it didn't.

14:06.763 --> 14:07.720
- You didn't go?

14:07.806 --> 14:09.806
- No, I went, I just
went with someone else.

14:09.933 --> 14:10.798
- What does that mean?

14:10.892 --> 14:12.892
- Another therapist in the same
suite.

14:12.978 --> 14:13.977
Marsha.

14:14.104 --> 14:15.979
I emailed Dr. Ellis.

14:16.106 --> 14:18.472
- Okay, well, that's a little
random.

14:18.567 --> 14:21.309
But how did it go with Marsha?

14:21.403 --> 14:23.611
- Um, really well.

14:23.697 --> 14:24.645
- Huh.
- You were right.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.573
It helps to talk with someone
who-

14:26.658 --> 14:28.149
- Can't tell anybody what you
said

14:28.243 --> 14:30.818
under penalty of law.

14:31.746 --> 14:32.912
- Yeah.

14:32.998 --> 14:34.455
So, are you gonna go back?

14:34.541 --> 14:35.415
- Twice a week.

14:36.459 --> 14:37.500
- I'm proud of you.

14:39.254 --> 14:40.661
- I think I am too.

14:40.755 --> 14:42.714
I just felt really comfortable
with her.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.166
We clicked.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.301
- Good.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.835
- All right, back to work.

14:47.929 --> 14:48.803
- Oh, yep.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.471
- I need those by 2 o'clock, by
the way.

14:59.816 --> 15:02.233
- Bethycurt, isn't that cute.

15:06.573 --> 15:07.447
Hm.

15:07.532 --> 15:08.364
So nasty.

15:10.452 --> 15:11.326
Help me!

15:15.624 --> 15:17.290
Mother and daughter.

15:21.588 --> 15:25.373
Oh, hello hubby.

15:27.135 --> 15:32.096
I'll have to pay Motley &
Mitchell a little visit.

15:35.977 --> 15:36.684
- No, I get it.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.552
Simon & Hodell is a great firm,

15:38.647 --> 15:40.355
so if you're happy with them...

15:40.440 --> 15:42.607
Yep, okay, bye.

15:44.027 --> 15:45.193
- Got a minute?

15:45.278 --> 15:45.902
- Dozens of 'em.

15:46.029 --> 15:47.320
What's up?
- Let's walk.

15:49.366 --> 15:51.324
We got a walk-in looking for a
new firm

15:51.409 --> 15:55.403
to manage her late father's
portfolio, it's massive.

15:55.497 --> 15:56.904
It could turn this whole
thing around, brother.

15:56.998 --> 15:58.039
- That's great.

15:58.124 --> 15:58.748
- It is great.

15:58.875 --> 15:59.749
And what's especially great

15:59.876 --> 16:01.793
is she asked for you
specifically.

16:01.878 --> 16:02.794
- She did?
- Mhm.

16:02.879 --> 16:04.754
Let's go see the boss.

16:06.174 --> 16:07.966
I hope we did not keep you
waiting.

16:08.927 --> 16:09.917
- Nick.

16:10.011 --> 16:10.885
- Marsha.

16:10.971 --> 16:11.752
Nice to meet you.

16:11.846 --> 16:13.012
- Pleasure.
- Come on, you two.

16:13.098 --> 16:13.972
Step on in here.

16:15.558 --> 16:16.599
- Thank you.

16:20.563 --> 16:22.397
- Mom, where's my phone?

16:23.942 --> 16:25.400
I don't know where I...

16:25.485 --> 16:26.317
- Oh.

16:27.737 --> 16:28.569
- Oh.

16:29.698 --> 16:31.364
- You're sure you don't
want to just study here?

16:32.325 --> 16:33.157
- Mom...

16:35.286 --> 16:36.452
- They're here.

16:40.250 --> 16:41.791
Study hard.

16:41.918 --> 16:44.502
- I like you guys, a lot.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.212
- We like to be liked.

16:46.297 --> 16:48.122
So, how'd you hear about us?

16:48.216 --> 16:50.925
- Oh, you did some work for
a friend of mine last year,

16:51.011 --> 16:52.760
a firm downtown.

16:52.846 --> 16:53.511
- Ah, the cars.

16:53.596 --> 16:55.805
- Yeah, said wonderful things.

16:55.932 --> 16:59.934
I tell you, I like the fact
that you're a family firm.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.635
But I do have to tell you

17:01.730 --> 17:05.306
that I am gonna be meeting
with Wolf & Waldron as well.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.357
- I'll tell you what.

17:06.443 --> 17:07.358
Give us a few days to
put together a proposal,

17:07.444 --> 17:09.643
and we'll get together next week
sometime

17:09.738 --> 17:11.312
and explain to you why
we beat the pants off

17:11.406 --> 17:12.905
of Wolf & Waldron.

17:12.991 --> 17:13.740
- Over dinner?

17:13.825 --> 17:14.699
- Absolutely.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.743
In fact, if you like the family
touch,

17:16.828 --> 17:18.319
why don't we skip the
restaurant,

17:18.413 --> 17:20.621
Nick's wife is a fantastic cook.

17:20.707 --> 17:21.664
- Actually, you know what?

17:21.791 --> 17:24.584
Beth's got a lot going
on at work right now.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.002
Maybe we can do Sabatino's?

17:28.590 --> 17:29.672
- Oh.

17:29.799 --> 17:30.882
Okay, sure.

17:32.010 --> 17:35.136
You know, I'm not getting
good reception up here.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.472
Wolf & Waldron, that's at 6th
Ave, right?

17:37.557 --> 17:38.181
- You know what?

17:38.308 --> 17:39.682
I'm sure it's fine.

17:39.809 --> 17:40.725
How's Tuesday at 7?

17:42.270 --> 17:43.561
- I'll bring the wine.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.346
- Great.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.847
Wonderful.
- Okay, great.

17:46.941 --> 17:47.815
See you Tuesday.
- Pleasure.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.650
- It's a pleasure.
- Thank you so much.

17:52.363 --> 17:54.855
- So, do I get to keep my job
now?

17:54.949 --> 17:55.948
- Keep it?

17:56.034 --> 17:57.358
If you sign her, I'll put
your name on the door,

17:57.452 --> 17:59.860
but don't tell her that
when you have dinner.

17:59.954 --> 18:01.037
- Wait, me?

18:01.164 --> 18:02.530
I thought this was an us.

18:02.624 --> 18:04.031
- Well, she seems comfortable
with you,

18:04.125 --> 18:05.875
I think it's best if you handle
it.

18:07.796 --> 18:09.087
You could save the firm.

18:09.172 --> 18:10.671
We're all counting on you, Nick.

18:10.757 --> 18:11.631
- You got it.

18:12.550 --> 18:14.592
Assuming my wife doesn't kill me
first.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.642
So, you think she'll be ready?

18:22.727 --> 18:25.436
- Well, she's certainly
working hard enough.

18:25.522 --> 18:27.054
I've barely seen her all week.

18:27.148 --> 18:28.940
She's always studying.

18:29.859 --> 18:30.566
- She's so cute.

18:32.987 --> 18:33.945
How would you feel about
spending

18:34.030 --> 18:36.656
a little quality time
with her in the kitchen?

18:37.992 --> 18:39.900
- Okay?

18:39.994 --> 18:42.703
- You know that new client
I was telling you about?

18:42.789 --> 18:43.904
- Mhm.

18:43.998 --> 18:47.834
- Trevor might've invited
her to dinner on Tuesday.

18:48.962 --> 18:49.836
- So?

18:51.297 --> 18:52.088
Here?

18:52.215 --> 18:53.339
- Yeah, I know, I know.
- Oh, God.

18:53.424 --> 18:55.916
- I'm sorry, I should talk to
you first.

18:56.010 --> 18:57.218
She's talking to Wolf & Waldron,

18:57.303 --> 19:00.721
and I think Trevor just wanted
to make an impression and...

19:00.807 --> 19:01.589
- Ugh.

19:01.683 --> 19:02.515
- It's fine.

19:04.185 --> 19:05.601
I'll just tell him you can't
host.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.478
- I don't want them to
know what happened, Nick.

19:07.564 --> 19:08.563
- I'll just come up with an
excuse.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.315
I'll tell him our dining
room table, it exploded.

19:12.861 --> 19:13.609
- Yeah, we should've paid
attention

19:13.736 --> 19:15.444
to that recall notice, right?

19:15.572 --> 19:16.112
- I'll come up with something.

19:16.239 --> 19:17.438
- No, that's silly.

19:17.532 --> 19:18.239
No, no, no.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.157
Don't do that.

19:19.242 --> 19:20.032
We can host.

19:20.118 --> 19:21.033
- Are you sure?

19:22.662 --> 19:24.787
- Yeah, I know how much
you need these new clients.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.122
- I don't want to push you into
something

19:26.249 --> 19:27.206
if you're not ready.

19:27.292 --> 19:29.000
- No, we'll make it work.

19:30.753 --> 19:32.620
- You're literally an angel sent
to Earth.

19:32.714 --> 19:34.755
You marry me and make my life
better.

19:36.384 --> 19:38.301
- And you are a cheeseball.

19:40.722 --> 19:41.512
When is this dinner?

19:41.598 --> 19:43.097
- Tuesday, 7 o'clock.

19:43.183 --> 19:45.132
- Well, I'll see if Simone's
free to help.

19:45.226 --> 19:46.100
- Oh, can you ask her to make

19:46.186 --> 19:47.768
those little cheesecakes that I
like?

19:47.854 --> 19:49.145
- You are pushing things.

19:49.272 --> 19:51.138
- Fine, whatever.

19:51.232 --> 19:53.107
What'd I do to deserve you?

19:53.193 --> 19:54.150
- You didn't.

19:57.906 --> 19:58.863
- Oh, I love you.
- Love you.

20:02.827 --> 20:04.994
- How were the last few days for
you?

20:06.247 --> 20:08.656
- Uh, better, I think.

20:08.750 --> 20:09.990
- Good.

20:10.084 --> 20:11.325
Better how?

20:11.419 --> 20:14.462
- I felt not necessarily less
scared,

20:14.547 --> 20:16.172
just more able to cope.

20:17.759 --> 20:19.833
Nick's been really supportive.

20:19.928 --> 20:21.844
Almost too supportive, actually.

20:21.971 --> 20:24.222
I think he's just worried about
me.

20:24.307 --> 20:25.598
- And what about Jess?

20:27.268 --> 20:29.393
- That's complicated.

20:30.355 --> 20:31.187
- How so?

20:32.899 --> 20:33.648
- Um-

20:33.733 --> 20:36.067
- Beth, remember.

20:36.152 --> 20:37.652
It's just you and me in here.

20:39.280 --> 20:42.740
- Well, Jess and I, we're just
starting

20:42.825 --> 20:44.575
to get back on track.

20:44.661 --> 20:46.786
Last year was a really rough
year for her.

20:46.871 --> 20:49.863
She ended up stealing
a car and wrecking it.

20:49.958 --> 20:51.499
She had been drinking.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.034
- Whoa, scary.

20:54.128 --> 20:55.294
- Yeah.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.838
I've never been so angry and
so relieved at the same time

20:57.924 --> 21:00.216
when I picked her up
from the police station.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.428
Was I working too much?

21:04.514 --> 21:05.471
Was I ignoring her?

21:05.556 --> 21:07.047
I mean, what kind of mother has
a daughter

21:07.141 --> 21:08.683
who does something so stupid?

21:10.019 --> 21:13.062
- I don't think it's about
the kind of mother, really.

21:14.107 --> 21:15.389
It's adolescents.

21:15.483 --> 21:18.058
They have half of the brain
capacity,

21:18.152 --> 21:19.893
twice the amount of hormones,

21:19.988 --> 21:22.238
they just do stupid things.

21:22.365 --> 21:23.364
- She was so embarrassed.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.399
I actually promised her
I wouldn't tell anyone

21:25.493 --> 21:26.066
about what happened.

21:26.160 --> 21:27.827
Not even Simone knows.

21:28.871 --> 21:31.905
- That's a lot to carry on your
own.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.574
- I think she realized that she

21:33.668 --> 21:34.542
really could've ruined her life,

21:34.627 --> 21:37.244
and she's really turned things
around.

21:37.338 --> 21:38.078
- And you don't want to risk
that.

21:38.172 --> 21:39.580
- No.

21:39.674 --> 21:41.507
She's working so hard.

21:41.592 --> 21:42.750
She's applying to colleges,

21:42.844 --> 21:44.418
and she's studying for the SAT.

21:44.512 --> 21:45.886
You know, she studies
every day after school

21:45.972 --> 21:46.920
at Phil's Diner.

21:47.015 --> 21:48.973
Well, they do have the best
coffee, but...

21:50.059 --> 21:51.517
She's got a lot on her plate.

21:52.395 --> 21:53.311
I just think that it's best if

21:53.396 --> 21:55.730
I keep my own problems my own
right now.

21:58.901 --> 22:00.943
Anyhow, speaking of problems,

22:01.070 --> 22:03.487
I do have a dinner to go make.

22:03.573 --> 22:04.447
- Oh.

22:04.574 --> 22:05.773
What are you making?

22:05.867 --> 22:07.616
- Salmon and risotto.

22:07.744 --> 22:09.660
- Salmon, I love salmon.

22:09.746 --> 22:11.203
Bring me leftovers?

22:11.289 --> 22:12.330
- Will do.

22:12.415 --> 22:16.542
- Beth, you are doing
really great work in here.

22:16.627 --> 22:18.169
I'm proud of you.

22:18.254 --> 22:20.046
- Thank you, Marsha.

22:20.131 --> 22:21.005
I'll see you soon.

22:22.133 --> 22:23.957
- Yes, you will.

22:34.062 --> 22:35.686
- Is she there?

22:35.772 --> 22:37.313
- Who?
- Marsha, Marsha!

22:37.440 --> 22:38.939
- Excuse me!

22:40.234 --> 22:41.809
Please, you need to sit down,

22:41.903 --> 22:42.985
I'll be with you in a moment.

22:43.112 --> 22:44.153
- She's not returning my calls,

22:44.280 --> 22:45.154
I need to talk to her.

22:45.281 --> 22:45.979
I need to talk to her!

22:46.074 --> 22:47.481
- Okay, okay, please calm down.

22:47.575 --> 22:48.532
- Is everything okay?

22:48.618 --> 22:49.325
- Everything's fine.

22:49.452 --> 22:50.150
- Do you need me to call
someone?

22:50.244 --> 22:51.151
- No, no, no, it's fine.

22:51.245 --> 22:51.985
You can go.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.487
- Are you sure?

22:53.581 --> 22:54.488
- It's fine.

22:54.582 --> 22:55.790
- Okay.

22:55.875 --> 22:56.990
Bye.
- Bye.

22:57.085 --> 22:57.825
- Please.

22:57.919 --> 22:59.159
Please, please.

22:59.253 --> 23:00.461
- Okay, please wait.

23:00.546 --> 23:01.379
Oh...

23:02.298 --> 23:03.130
Okay.

23:04.175 --> 23:05.341
Okay, well...

23:06.677 --> 23:07.635
- She's not here.

23:08.846 --> 23:09.678
- No.

23:10.598 --> 23:12.005
She's not here.

23:12.100 --> 23:14.642
She wants me to give you a
message.

23:14.727 --> 23:15.810
- What, you talked to her?

23:15.895 --> 23:17.344
What did she say?

23:17.438 --> 23:19.680
- She said she doesn't
want to see you anymore.

23:19.774 --> 23:21.065
- What?

23:21.150 --> 23:22.358
She wouldn't say that.

23:22.485 --> 23:23.192
- She changed her mind.

23:23.319 --> 23:25.018
- No, no, I want to talk to her.

23:25.113 --> 23:25.778
I need to talk to her.

23:25.863 --> 23:28.197
- Well, you can't talk to her.

23:28.324 --> 23:29.782
And if I ever see you again,

23:29.867 --> 23:31.992
if you ever come back here,

23:32.078 --> 23:33.244
I'm gonna have to call the
police

23:33.329 --> 23:37.289
and let them know everything
that's in your file, Jacob.

23:39.502 --> 23:41.201
- You can't do that.

23:41.295 --> 23:43.045
- Oh, I can do that.

23:43.172 --> 23:45.923
I can do a lot worse than that.

23:49.011 --> 23:49.969
Don't test me.

23:54.559 --> 23:55.266
You know what?

23:55.351 --> 23:57.810
You know, maybe I can help you.

24:01.482 --> 24:02.773
I have the perfect therapy.

24:23.504 --> 24:25.045
- Okay, how's it going in
here?

24:25.131 --> 24:26.046
- Ready in 5.

24:26.132 --> 24:26.755
- Great.

24:26.883 --> 24:28.632
Simone, mini cheesecakes.

24:28.718 --> 24:29.758
Thank you.

24:29.886 --> 24:31.093
You didn't let her add
too much cayenne, did you?

24:31.220 --> 24:33.554
- We're out of cayenne,
I subbed in ghost pepper.

24:33.639 --> 24:34.555
- Yes!

24:34.640 --> 24:35.264
All right, I'm gonna check on
the grill.

24:35.391 --> 24:37.090
- Thank you, honey.

24:37.185 --> 24:37.758
How you doin', Simone?

24:37.852 --> 24:38.809
You need some help?

24:38.895 --> 24:40.478
- Nope, I am finished.

24:43.357 --> 24:44.440
- Of course, they're early.

24:44.567 --> 24:46.192
- Oh, I can get it.

24:46.277 --> 24:47.735
- No, it's fine.

24:47.820 --> 24:50.237
You stay here and help
Jess with the sauce.

24:50.323 --> 24:51.605
Okay.

24:56.204 --> 24:57.277
Marsha?

24:57.371 --> 24:58.037
- Beth?

24:59.707 --> 25:00.789
- What are you doing here?

25:00.917 --> 25:01.916
Is everything okay?

25:02.960 --> 25:04.960
- Yes, I had no idea this was
your house,

25:05.087 --> 25:07.421
I'm just supposed to meet
my attorney for dinner.

25:07.507 --> 25:09.089
- Your attorney?

25:10.384 --> 25:12.292
You're the new client.

25:12.386 --> 25:13.344
Oh...

25:13.429 --> 25:15.796
- My father left me his
real estate holdings

25:15.890 --> 25:17.181
and they're a mess.

25:17.266 --> 25:19.800
Anyway, nevermind, it doesn't
matter.

25:19.894 --> 25:21.936
This must be so awkward for you.

25:22.021 --> 25:22.770
I'm gonna leave.

25:22.855 --> 25:23.896
- No, please.

25:23.981 --> 25:26.473
The whole point of this
dinner is to impress you.

25:26.567 --> 25:27.474
Are you impressed?

25:29.028 --> 25:30.236
- Are you sure?

25:30.321 --> 25:32.571
I don't want to stay unless
you're completely comfortable.

25:33.824 --> 25:35.074
- Marsha, hi!

25:35.159 --> 25:35.699
Welcome.

25:35.785 --> 25:37.985
I see you my wife, Beth.

25:38.079 --> 25:40.320
- We've definitely met.

25:40.414 --> 25:42.489
- All right, well come on
inside, dinner's almost ready.

25:42.583 --> 25:43.657
This is perfect, thank you.

25:43.751 --> 25:46.460
Come on in.

26:01.561 --> 26:02.810
- This is delicious, Nick.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.270
- I can't take the credit.

26:04.355 --> 26:06.063
Beth and Jess have done all the
hard work,

26:06.148 --> 26:07.514
I just threw it on the grill.

26:08.317 --> 26:09.567
- Mother-daughter team.

26:10.444 --> 26:11.193
- Yeah.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.653
Jess is a real whiz in the
kitchen.

26:14.240 --> 26:14.947
Jess?

26:17.827 --> 26:19.201
- Oh, I was just telling Carmen

26:19.328 --> 26:20.035
I'm just gonna be a little bit
late.

26:20.162 --> 26:22.496
- Oh, did you have plans
tonight?

26:22.582 --> 26:24.039
- Just studying.

26:24.166 --> 26:26.000
- Jess is taking the SAT next
week.

26:26.085 --> 26:28.035
- And she's been putting in
those hours,

26:28.129 --> 26:29.369
hittin' those books.

26:30.631 --> 26:32.798
- Well, I appreciate you
making time to cook for us.

26:32.883 --> 26:35.709
- Oh, like we said, we like
to put the family touch

26:35.803 --> 26:36.677
on things at the firm.

26:36.762 --> 26:39.638
- Ah, I see we've reached the
hard sell

26:39.724 --> 26:41.140
portion of our evening.

26:41.225 --> 26:43.225
- I wouldn't call it a
hard sell.

26:44.645 --> 26:48.022
- You know, why don't I get
these dishes out of here, hm?

26:48.107 --> 26:48.772
Jess?

26:48.858 --> 26:49.982
- Yeah, I'll help you.

26:51.152 --> 26:53.944
- So, I know you've been
taking a couple of meetings,

26:54.030 --> 26:56.730
but let me tell you why Motley &
Mitchell

26:56.824 --> 26:59.283
is the perfect fit for your
portfolio.

27:01.495 --> 27:02.995
- Hey, time for dessert?

27:03.080 --> 27:03.996
- Uh, just about.

27:04.081 --> 27:05.289
- Mom, I'll get the rest of the
dishes.

27:05.374 --> 27:06.248
- Thank you.

27:08.085 --> 27:10.077
- So, how's it going down there?

27:10.171 --> 27:12.245
- Oh, just as well as you'd
expect

27:12.340 --> 27:15.174
when your therapist shows up
to dinner with your husband.

27:16.177 --> 27:17.084
- I still can't believe she
stayed.

27:17.178 --> 27:18.919
- Oh, I asked her to.

27:19.013 --> 27:20.921
Nick could really use
the new client right now.

27:21.015 --> 27:23.432
- No, what he needs is a
swift kick in the butt, okay?

27:23.559 --> 27:24.925
She should not have stayed.

27:25.019 --> 27:25.759
- Do you need any more help?

27:25.853 --> 27:27.311
Because I have to go study.

27:27.396 --> 27:28.261
- Before cheesecake?

27:28.356 --> 27:30.064
Simone spent the whole afternoon
on it.

27:30.149 --> 27:33.600
- No, my secret ingredient is
misanthropy.

27:33.694 --> 27:35.986
- Thanks, but I just want
to get back to the books.

27:36.072 --> 27:37.446
- Um, okay.

27:37.573 --> 27:38.947
Well, you know, Jess, your
father and I

27:39.075 --> 27:40.774
would really love it if you
stayed.

27:40.868 --> 27:42.442
- But Mom...

27:42.536 --> 27:43.202
- Okay.

27:43.287 --> 27:44.453
- Need any help with dessert?

27:44.580 --> 27:45.537
- I'll be upstairs.

27:46.624 --> 27:47.623
- Yeah, I think we're good.

27:49.377 --> 27:50.834
- Everything okay?

27:50.920 --> 27:51.952
- Everything's fine.

27:52.046 --> 27:53.629
Marsha, have you met Simone?

27:53.756 --> 27:55.798
- No, it's nice to meet you.

27:57.426 --> 27:59.802
- Isn't it a little weird for a
therapist

27:59.929 --> 28:01.128
to show up at a client's house?

28:01.222 --> 28:01.970
- Simone.

28:02.098 --> 28:03.722
- No, it's okay.

28:03.808 --> 28:06.183
I really wouldn't have
come if I had known.

28:06.268 --> 28:06.975
- I'm sure.

28:08.187 --> 28:11.304
So, you must know Brendan?

28:11.399 --> 28:12.773
From your office?

28:12.858 --> 28:14.441
- Yes, of course.

28:14.527 --> 28:16.309
Love Brendan.

28:16.404 --> 28:17.811
- He's been my therapist for
years,

28:17.905 --> 28:20.280
but never been over for dinner.

28:22.410 --> 28:24.535
- Would you point me in the
direction of the powder room?

28:24.620 --> 28:25.536
- Of course.

28:25.621 --> 28:27.246
It's straight down the hall on
the right.

28:35.005 --> 28:35.829
- What?

28:35.923 --> 28:37.131
- Do I really have to answer
that?

28:37.216 --> 28:40.000
- I'm sorry, it's just a
complete violation of ethics.

28:40.094 --> 28:40.884
- Okay, well tonight we're gonna
have to

28:40.970 --> 28:42.845
bend the ethics just a little
bit.

28:43.931 --> 28:45.338
- I don't agree, okay?

28:45.433 --> 28:47.174
Someone should report her.

28:47.268 --> 28:48.809
- Well, someone needs to calm
down

28:48.894 --> 28:51.437
and help me with the
cheesecakes.

28:51.522 --> 28:52.354
Come on.

28:59.029 --> 29:00.687
Are you sure you don't want a
ride home?

29:00.781 --> 29:02.030
- Ah, it's just a couple blocks.

29:02.158 --> 29:03.690
I'll walk off some of that
cheesecake.

29:03.784 --> 29:04.533
- Okay.

29:04.660 --> 29:05.242
Well, thank you again for
staying

29:05.327 --> 29:06.326
to help with the dishes.

29:06.412 --> 29:08.195
I don't know what I would do
without you.

29:08.289 --> 29:09.747
- Oh, well I'm sure you and
Marsha

29:09.832 --> 29:11.165
can figure things out.

29:11.250 --> 29:11.915
- Simone.

29:12.001 --> 29:12.958
- Oh, fine, I'll drop it.

29:13.043 --> 29:16.253
But if she shows up at cosmo
night,

29:16.338 --> 29:17.379
I'm gonna say something.

29:18.340 --> 29:19.548
- Goodnight, Simone.
- Goodnight.

29:19.675 --> 29:21.884
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

29:30.644 --> 29:31.435
- Simone?

29:32.813 --> 29:33.854
Simone.

29:33.939 --> 29:35.222
You forgot your cheesecake
stuff.

29:35.316 --> 29:36.315
- Oh, right.

29:37.359 --> 29:38.734
Any chance I can get that ride?

29:38.861 --> 29:39.526
- Let me get my keys.

29:39.612 --> 29:41.528
But, hands off the radio.

29:41.614 --> 29:43.396
- Oh, God, I'm not listening to
country

29:43.491 --> 29:45.240
for two whole blocks.

29:54.502 --> 29:57.077
- Well, I would call that a
success, huh?

29:57.171 --> 29:59.004
- I'd say that we pulled it off.

29:59.089 --> 30:00.080
- Thank you for doing this.

30:00.174 --> 30:01.590
I know it was a lot to ask.

30:02.927 --> 30:03.917
- Yeah.

30:04.011 --> 30:05.844
Well, let's just hope
that Marsha's impressed.

30:05.930 --> 30:07.429
- Ah, I think she's great.

30:07.556 --> 30:10.390
Maybe we can have her
over again some time, huh?

30:10.476 --> 30:12.768
- I don't think that's an
option.

30:12.895 --> 30:14.019
- Why not?

30:14.104 --> 30:17.264
- Remember that therapist
that I told you I was seeing?

30:17.358 --> 30:18.732
A woman named Marsha?

30:19.944 --> 30:20.609
- You're kidding.

30:23.072 --> 30:24.988
I had no idea, I am so sorry.

30:26.659 --> 30:27.491
Okay.

30:27.576 --> 30:29.076
I'll call her tomorrow and tell
her

30:29.161 --> 30:30.244
she needs to find another
attorney.

30:30.329 --> 30:31.245
- Oh, no, no, no.

30:31.330 --> 30:32.445
It's fine, Nick.

30:32.540 --> 30:33.372
I talked to her after dinner,

30:33.457 --> 30:34.832
and she said that as long as we
keep

30:34.917 --> 30:37.042
our relationships professional,

30:37.127 --> 30:39.086
mine and hers and hers and
yours,

30:39.171 --> 30:41.588
then there should be no
conflict.

30:41.674 --> 30:42.789
- Are you sure?

30:42.883 --> 30:44.842
I don't want you to feel
uncomfortable with your therapy.

30:45.845 --> 30:47.094
- No, it's fine.

30:48.389 --> 30:49.629
- Okay.

30:49.723 --> 30:50.556
As long as we don't have to

30:50.641 --> 30:52.891
keep our relationship
professional.

30:52.977 --> 30:53.684
Hm?

31:02.736 --> 31:03.819
- You're up early.

31:05.406 --> 31:06.280
- Oh, yeah.

31:06.365 --> 31:07.364
I have a chemistry test this
afternoon,

31:07.449 --> 31:09.867
so just want to get some
extra study time in.

31:11.036 --> 31:11.869
What?

31:12.788 --> 31:13.495
- Nothing.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.289
I'm just really proud of you.

31:16.333 --> 31:19.084
- Well, let's see how
I do on the test first.

31:19.169 --> 31:20.002
- You know what I mean.

31:20.129 --> 31:22.629
You've come so far in the past
year.

31:22.715 --> 31:23.881
- Mom.

31:23.966 --> 31:24.882
I hate when you bring that up.

31:24.967 --> 31:26.666
I just want to leave of that
behind me.

31:26.760 --> 31:27.634
- I know.

31:29.096 --> 31:29.887
I know.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.431
Hey, where you going?

31:32.516 --> 31:34.057
- I'm gonna finish
studying at the library.

31:34.143 --> 31:35.893
- Oh, honey, I didn't mean to-

31:35.978 --> 31:38.770
- No, but I just need to focus.

31:38.856 --> 31:40.355
- I just wanted you to
know that we realize

31:40.482 --> 31:42.357
how hard you've been working.

31:42.484 --> 31:44.776
- Well, let's hope Price
University does.

31:44.862 --> 31:45.777
- Still no word?

31:45.863 --> 31:46.945
- No.

31:47.031 --> 31:47.854
But Carmen heard yesterday,

31:47.948 --> 31:49.740
so I know that it's gonna be
soon.

31:49.825 --> 31:51.033
- Well, you can always live here

31:51.160 --> 31:52.367
and you can go to State.

31:53.287 --> 31:54.161
- Mom.

31:55.122 --> 31:56.696
- Okay.

31:56.790 --> 31:58.031
Well, I'll see you tonight.

31:58.125 --> 31:58.865
Okay?
- Okay.

31:58.959 --> 31:59.791
- Love you.

32:01.712 --> 32:02.502
- Bye.

32:02.588 --> 32:03.462
- Bye.

32:12.014 --> 32:14.214
- So, how did it go last night?

32:14.308 --> 32:15.382
- Actually, pretty well.

32:15.476 --> 32:17.050
I think she likes us.

32:17.144 --> 32:18.060
- Well, I think you're right.

32:18.187 --> 32:21.054
She just called, and
she's signing with us.

32:21.148 --> 32:21.897
- Yes!

32:22.024 --> 32:23.023
Fantastic.

32:23.108 --> 32:25.108
- Whatever you did last
night, keep doing it.

32:25.194 --> 32:27.194
- Actually, I was wondering if I
could

32:27.279 --> 32:28.528
hand this one off to you.

32:29.448 --> 32:30.397
- Hand her off?

32:30.491 --> 32:31.073
What does that mean?

32:31.200 --> 32:32.616
- It's the craziest thing.

32:32.701 --> 32:35.068
Turns out, she knows my wife.

32:35.162 --> 32:36.787
- She knows your wife.

32:36.872 --> 32:38.455
That's not exactly a problem.

32:39.833 --> 32:41.408
- Marsha is Beth's therapist.

32:42.294 --> 32:43.460
- You're joking.

32:43.545 --> 32:44.127
- I'm not.

32:44.213 --> 32:45.879
- Oh my God, well...

32:46.757 --> 32:49.299
That's not an ethical conflict
for you.

32:49.385 --> 32:50.083
- No, well-

32:50.177 --> 32:51.635
- Then what's the problem?

32:51.720 --> 32:52.761
- There isn't a problem,

32:52.888 --> 32:54.471
I just don't want it to
be awkward for my wife.

32:54.556 --> 32:56.756
- Did Beth say it was awkward?

32:56.850 --> 32:58.258
- No, but I-

32:58.352 --> 33:00.927
- Nick, let me be very clear
here.

33:01.021 --> 33:04.439
Signing Marsha Davies is make
or break it for the firm,

33:04.566 --> 33:06.933
and it's make it or break it for
you, pal.

33:07.027 --> 33:08.485
So you need to decide what a
little bit

33:08.570 --> 33:10.362
of awkwardness is worth, okay?

33:11.407 --> 33:14.116
Look, therapy is a lot like the
law.

33:14.243 --> 33:15.942
People come to you with their
problems,

33:16.036 --> 33:17.444
lie to you about what they are,

33:17.538 --> 33:18.778
refuse to take your advice,

33:18.872 --> 33:21.373
and expect things to get better.

33:21.458 --> 33:23.417
And you're supposed to
smile, take their money,

33:23.502 --> 33:24.626
and pretend you don't know
they're lying

33:24.753 --> 33:27.454
and keep your mouth shut about
everything they tell you.

33:27.548 --> 33:29.456
And if you and I can do that,

33:29.550 --> 33:32.926
then no reason in the world
that Marsha Davies can't.

33:33.012 --> 33:33.969
Unless you think

33:34.096 --> 33:36.463
she's some sort of
psychopathic psychologist.

33:38.225 --> 33:39.799
- You're right, you're right.

33:39.893 --> 33:42.135
I appreciate the advice, Trevor.

33:42.229 --> 33:43.103
- Of course.

33:43.188 --> 33:45.022
You know, I thought I was wrong
once,

33:45.858 --> 33:47.274
but I was wrong.

33:53.407 --> 33:55.482
- And we'll need delivery
of the adjusted estimates

33:55.576 --> 33:57.534
by the 26th so that we can
update them

33:57.619 --> 33:58.985
before the presentation.

33:59.079 --> 34:01.321
- I'll call over to NVE in the
morning.

34:01.415 --> 34:02.289
- Great.

34:03.250 --> 34:06.126
- Or did you want to have Marsha
call?

34:06.211 --> 34:07.160
- Simone.

34:07.254 --> 34:08.495
We've talked about this.

34:08.589 --> 34:10.547
It was a completely random
fluke.

34:10.632 --> 34:12.591
- Well, that's pretty freakin'
random.

34:13.510 --> 34:16.470
You don't think there's
something off about her?

34:16.555 --> 34:17.670
- Off like what?

34:17.765 --> 34:19.681
- I don't know, I just got a
vibe.

34:19.808 --> 34:21.841
- I didn't know there was a vibe
involved.

34:21.935 --> 34:23.518
Maybe we should look into her.

34:23.645 --> 34:24.844
- I already did.

34:24.938 --> 34:25.854
- You what?

34:27.149 --> 34:29.849
- I called Dr. Ellis, asked
him what he thought of her.

34:29.943 --> 34:30.567
- You're kidding me.

34:30.652 --> 34:33.520
And what did Dr. Ellis say?

34:33.614 --> 34:35.280
- He said Marsha's excellent.

34:35.365 --> 34:36.406
- Really?

34:36.492 --> 34:38.024
- Well, she was a senior
in the office for a while,

34:38.118 --> 34:39.025
but she's a great therapist,

34:39.119 --> 34:41.787
and he refers people to her all
the time.

34:41.872 --> 34:44.915
- So, why are we still talking
about this?

34:45.000 --> 34:46.083
- I guess we're not.

34:46.168 --> 34:46.875
- All right.

34:47.002 --> 34:49.127
Get those papers to me please.

34:56.929 --> 34:58.261
Hello?

34:58.347 --> 35:00.180
- Beth, it's Marsha.

35:00.265 --> 35:02.015
- Uh, did we have an
appointment?

35:02.101 --> 35:04.017
I thought that we were meeting
on Friday.

35:04.103 --> 35:05.218
- Yes, we are.

35:05.312 --> 35:08.313
I just wanted to see how
you're doing after last night.

35:08.398 --> 35:10.723
I know it was a little
unexpected.

35:10.818 --> 35:11.891
- A little?

35:13.362 --> 35:16.071
- Well, maybe you'd like to meet
up today,

35:16.198 --> 35:17.447
just to process it?

35:17.533 --> 35:19.658
Not a session, just a check-in.

35:21.495 --> 35:22.569
- Um-

35:22.663 --> 35:24.704
- I just want to make sure
that you're feeling okay

35:24.790 --> 35:25.914
after everything.

35:27.543 --> 35:29.709
- Uh, yeah, that would be nice.

35:29.795 --> 35:30.743
- Great.

35:30.838 --> 35:32.745
So, how about I pick
up a couple of coffees

35:32.840 --> 35:35.582
and I meet you at that
park near your office?

35:35.676 --> 35:36.716
Say, half an hour?

35:37.553 --> 35:39.052
- Okay, see you then.

35:39.138 --> 35:39.970
- See you then.

35:54.361 --> 35:55.735
Hey there.

35:55.821 --> 35:56.444
- Oh.

35:56.572 --> 35:58.613
- I'm glad we could meet.

35:58.740 --> 35:59.739
- Me too.

35:59.825 --> 36:01.491
It's nice to get out of
the office for a bit.

36:01.577 --> 36:02.442
- Oh, yes.

36:02.536 --> 36:04.744
And we're much less likely to be
accosted

36:04.830 --> 36:06.779
by angry randos out here.

36:08.500 --> 36:09.457
- Who was he?

36:09.585 --> 36:10.792
Or can you not say?

36:13.338 --> 36:15.622
- He's an ex of one of my
clients.

36:15.716 --> 36:18.633
He keeps coming to sessions
hoping to find her.

36:18.760 --> 36:21.094
She's trying to get a
restraining order.

36:21.180 --> 36:22.554
- That's scary.

36:22.639 --> 36:23.180
- Yeah.

36:23.265 --> 36:24.222
So if you see him again,

36:24.308 --> 36:26.600
just let me know right away,
okay?

36:27.519 --> 36:28.968
- You got it.

36:29.062 --> 36:31.271
- So, how do you feel last night
went?

36:32.357 --> 36:35.483
- I guess that's really
more of a question for you.

36:35.611 --> 36:37.736
- Well, I don't think it
could've gone any better.

36:37.821 --> 36:40.197
Nick seems to have
everything well in hand,

36:40.282 --> 36:42.482
and dinner was delicious.

36:42.576 --> 36:44.150
- Oh, well I had some help.

36:44.244 --> 36:45.118
Nick did the grilling,

36:45.204 --> 36:46.536
and Jess has been great in the
kitchen

36:46.622 --> 36:48.154
ever since she was a little kid.

36:48.248 --> 36:49.989
- Yeah, she seems really great.

36:50.083 --> 36:53.293
You know, it's a shame that
she couldn't stay for dessert.

36:54.755 --> 36:57.664
- Well, she's been so
busy with her senior year.

36:57.758 --> 36:58.798
- I noticed.

37:00.010 --> 37:02.344
And she and I haven't really
been connecting lately.

37:03.305 --> 37:05.171
- Well, maybe you should bring
her in

37:05.265 --> 37:07.173
to one of your sessions.

37:07.267 --> 37:08.266
- What?

37:09.603 --> 37:12.395
- Well, I know that your
relationship has been
complicated,

37:12.481 --> 37:14.272
and sometimes it's just nice to
have

37:14.358 --> 37:18.518
a third party facilitator,
help with the communication.

37:18.612 --> 37:20.070
- I don't think so.

37:20.155 --> 37:21.112
- Why not?

37:22.282 --> 37:25.242
- I'm just not really
comfortable with that idea.

37:26.453 --> 37:28.161
Just, I told you so much about
myself,

37:28.247 --> 37:30.530
and I just think that I
need to keep my therapy life

37:30.624 --> 37:32.457
separate from my everyday life.

37:33.377 --> 37:35.835
- Perhaps a one on one then.

37:35.921 --> 37:37.754
Beth, I really think that I
could help-

37:37.839 --> 37:40.924
- I appreciate it, Marsha,
but the answer's no.

37:44.096 --> 37:44.877
- All right then.

37:46.848 --> 37:47.681
I understand.

37:52.312 --> 37:54.271
- Such a jerk, I don't know why.

37:54.356 --> 37:55.355
Nothing that I ever did to him,

37:55.440 --> 37:56.564
but for some reason he
just has it out for me

37:56.692 --> 37:58.358
and I don't get it.

37:58.443 --> 37:59.392
Well, I'm gonna see you
tomorrow, okay?

37:59.486 --> 38:00.360
- Bye.
- Bye.

38:04.741 --> 38:05.407
- Oh!

38:05.534 --> 38:07.567
- Oh my goodness, I am so sorry.

38:07.661 --> 38:09.235
- No, it's totally my fault.

38:09.329 --> 38:10.570
I am such a klutz.

38:10.664 --> 38:13.623
I dropped my keys and I can't
seem to find where they went.

38:13.709 --> 38:15.417
- Oh, um...

38:18.714 --> 38:19.754
Here they are.

38:21.341 --> 38:22.507
- Thank you so much.

38:24.428 --> 38:26.085
Hey, I know you.

38:26.179 --> 38:28.588
You're Beth's daughter, right?

38:28.682 --> 38:31.725
I was at your house last night
for dinner.

38:31.810 --> 38:33.935
- Oh, yeah, oh my gosh.

38:34.896 --> 38:36.429
What brings you to high school?

38:36.523 --> 38:37.764
- Well, would you believe me if
I said

38:37.858 --> 38:39.566
I was 17 years old?

38:39.651 --> 38:40.433
- No.

38:41.403 --> 38:42.268
But I would believe that you
were

38:42.362 --> 38:43.611
an undercover officer trying to
bust

38:43.739 --> 38:44.654
a high school crime ring.

38:46.074 --> 38:49.075
- No, I'm just helping out
with the counseling department.

38:49.161 --> 38:51.277
Yeah, I work at a couple
of the schools around town.

38:51.371 --> 38:53.780
- Wow, cool.

38:53.874 --> 38:55.615
Well, I will definitely tell
my parents that you said hi.

38:55.709 --> 38:56.458
- Okay.

38:56.585 --> 38:57.950
Mind if I ask you one more
favor?

38:58.045 --> 38:59.252
Do you know of any good places

38:59.338 --> 39:00.420
to get coffee around here?

39:02.090 --> 39:05.592
I'm about to collapse
unless I get caffeinated.

39:06.511 --> 39:07.469
- Well, yeah.

39:07.596 --> 39:09.804
I was on my way to study
over at Phil's Diner.

39:09.931 --> 39:11.014
- Mind if I follow?

39:11.892 --> 39:12.465
- Um, yeah.

39:12.559 --> 39:14.142
Yeah, sure, of course.

39:15.062 --> 39:16.353
- Okay.

39:25.405 --> 39:26.979
- So, how do you know my mom?

39:27.074 --> 39:29.449
- Oh, we met a little while ago.

39:29.534 --> 39:31.493
She's such a lovely woman.

39:32.537 --> 39:33.653
- Yeah, well, she can be,

39:33.747 --> 39:36.489
though I suggest you do
not come home after curfew.

39:38.085 --> 39:41.327
- So, what are all these
shapes and squiggles?

39:41.421 --> 39:42.545
- Oh, these.

39:42.631 --> 39:43.546
So, they call it math,

39:44.591 --> 39:46.216
but I think they're pretty much
just

39:46.301 --> 39:48.167
an updated version of Medieval
torture.

39:49.179 --> 39:51.337
- So, what are your plans for
college?

39:51.431 --> 39:53.264
- Well...

39:53.350 --> 39:55.675
Most of my friends are
staying around here.

39:55.769 --> 39:57.143
- But not you though.

39:58.438 --> 39:59.229
- I don't know.

39:59.314 --> 40:00.271
You know, I kind of just want to
see

40:00.357 --> 40:02.515
what else is out there, you
know?

40:02.609 --> 40:03.858
- Mhm.

40:03.985 --> 40:05.527
Is that why you're studying so
hard?

40:05.654 --> 40:08.530
- Well, I applied to
Price for early admission.

40:11.284 --> 40:12.859
I want to see what my options
are,

40:12.953 --> 40:15.027
I don't want to limit myself.

40:15.122 --> 40:17.247
'Cause what if I could do
something great?

40:17.332 --> 40:18.248
- You could.

40:19.167 --> 40:21.251
- Yeah, well, try telling my mom
then.

40:22.170 --> 40:23.753
- Is she not supportive?

40:23.839 --> 40:26.339
- Well, you see, it's not
that she's un-supportive,

40:26.425 --> 40:29.709
but I think she just wants
me to stay close to home.

40:29.803 --> 40:31.719
- Mm, 'cause of last year.

40:34.683 --> 40:35.882
- What do you mean?

40:35.976 --> 40:36.933
- The drunk driving.

40:37.018 --> 40:39.436
It sounds like you had
a really tough go of it.

40:42.274 --> 40:44.315
- She told you about that?

40:44.401 --> 40:45.233
- Don't worry.

40:45.360 --> 40:47.735
It's not uncommon for someone
your age

40:47.863 --> 40:49.362
to act out a little bit.

40:52.951 --> 40:56.119
- She's never gonna let
me move past that, is she?

40:56.204 --> 41:00.072
I spent this past year trying
to prove that I've grown up.

41:00.167 --> 41:01.791
But she's never gonna be
able to see me as anything

41:01.877 --> 41:03.910
except for the kid behind
the wheel of that car.

41:04.004 --> 41:05.545
- No, I don't think that's true.

41:06.840 --> 41:08.080
I think she's just not ready

41:08.175 --> 41:11.009
to let you be out there on your
own yet.

41:11.094 --> 41:12.093
She loves you.

41:13.346 --> 41:15.805
- Yeah, well, she's got a
funny way of showing it, huh?

41:17.017 --> 41:17.932
- Jess.

41:19.227 --> 41:21.978
You know, try to think of it
from your mom's perspective.

41:22.063 --> 41:24.430
This past year has been hard on
her too.

41:24.524 --> 41:26.774
Why do you think she's
been working so much?

41:30.030 --> 41:30.904
- What?

41:33.074 --> 41:35.200
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't of said
anything.

41:36.161 --> 41:37.952
- Are you saying that my
mom's been working so much

41:38.079 --> 41:42.457
so that she doesn't have to be
around me?

41:42.584 --> 41:43.625
- No, I didn't say that.

41:43.752 --> 41:44.951
- But did she?

41:45.045 --> 41:45.835
- Jess.

41:45.921 --> 41:46.794
- Forget it.

41:47.589 --> 41:49.339
I have to study, so...

41:49.424 --> 41:50.256
- Of course.

41:50.342 --> 41:52.458
Good luck with your Medieval
torture.

41:52.552 --> 41:54.052
- Thanks.

42:02.938 --> 42:04.687
- Mm, they forgot to
include the overtime numbers

42:04.773 --> 42:06.806
so we're just waiting on that
update.

42:06.900 --> 42:07.974
Hi, sweetie.

42:08.068 --> 42:09.141
Let me call you back.

42:09.236 --> 42:10.610
You're home early.

42:10.695 --> 42:11.811
- I couldn't really focus.

42:11.905 --> 42:13.145
- Well, you deserve a break.

42:13.240 --> 42:14.480
I'm home early too, and I
thought maybe

42:14.574 --> 42:16.482
we could make dinner together?

42:16.576 --> 42:17.742
- I'm not hungry.

42:17.827 --> 42:20.787
- Well, I have something that
might help your appetite.

42:20.872 --> 42:21.821
- From Price?

42:21.915 --> 42:22.789
- Mhm.

42:29.089 --> 42:31.130
What does it say?

42:31.216 --> 42:32.924
What does it say?

42:33.009 --> 42:34.425
- I didn't get in.

42:34.511 --> 42:36.335
I can apply again with my new
SAT scores.

42:36.429 --> 42:37.670
- Oh, honey.

42:37.764 --> 42:38.846
- What?

42:38.974 --> 42:40.840
This is what you wanted anyway.

42:40.934 --> 42:41.674
Isn't it?

42:41.768 --> 42:42.684
- What?

42:42.811 --> 42:43.768
- For me to get rejected,

42:43.853 --> 42:45.678
so that I have to stay
home and go to State.

42:45.772 --> 42:46.854
All because of the stupid
mistake

42:46.982 --> 42:48.147
that I made a year ago.

42:48.233 --> 42:48.982
- No, I-

42:49.067 --> 42:49.941
- You know what?

42:51.027 --> 42:52.852
I believed you when you
said you were over it,

42:52.946 --> 42:54.854
but you're never gonna
let this go, are you?

42:54.948 --> 42:55.572
- Jess!

42:55.657 --> 42:57.490
- Just leave me alone.

42:57.576 --> 42:58.858
- But honey...

43:03.582 --> 43:04.664
Hello?

43:04.749 --> 43:05.707
Yes, but I...

43:07.127 --> 43:08.534
Right now?

43:08.628 --> 43:11.379
Um, yeah, I can send those right
now.

43:12.507 --> 43:14.465
Okay, yeah, I'm sending them
right now.

43:18.972 --> 43:20.046
I don't know what happened.

43:20.140 --> 43:21.973
She just completely cut me off.

43:22.058 --> 43:24.383
- Oh, she'll come around.

43:24.477 --> 43:27.937
Try to remember your emotions at
that age.

43:28.023 --> 43:29.055
- I'd rather forget.

43:30.483 --> 43:32.483
- So, how are things otherwise?

43:33.320 --> 43:34.652
- Better, I think.

43:34.738 --> 43:36.613
I've finally been able to focus
on my work

43:36.698 --> 43:37.739
which is really good,

43:37.866 --> 43:40.900
because we have that
presentation this afternoon.

43:40.994 --> 43:42.068
- You've been working hard on
that.

43:42.162 --> 43:44.746
- Yeah, for the last few months.

43:44.873 --> 43:47.415
My boss's boss has been
breathing down her neck,

43:47.542 --> 43:50.576
and our CEO is in from New York.

43:50.670 --> 43:52.712
- That's a lot to worry about.

43:52.797 --> 43:53.504
- It is.

43:54.507 --> 43:56.415
But thank God I have Simone.

43:56.509 --> 43:57.416
You know, she's handling the
slides

43:57.510 --> 43:59.010
so I can focus on my talk.

43:59.971 --> 44:01.754
- Sounds like you guys are a
good team.

44:01.848 --> 44:02.755
- Yeah.

44:02.849 --> 44:03.931
It's funny.

44:04.059 --> 44:06.759
She swore she would never
work in the corporate world,

44:06.853 --> 44:09.428
but when she saw how much
pressure I was under,

44:09.522 --> 44:12.065
she agreed to come on
board to help me out.

44:12.150 --> 44:13.766
And she's great.

44:13.860 --> 44:15.401
She's been with us for a year.

44:15.487 --> 44:16.486
- And how's that going?

44:18.031 --> 44:19.939
- Well, it's a bit of
an adjustment for her.

44:21.201 --> 44:23.275
She's a bit of a square peg.

44:23.370 --> 44:25.161
She doesn't like to wear
her shoes in the office,

44:25.246 --> 44:27.163
and she takes naps in her car.

44:27.248 --> 44:29.874
And she's always threatening to
quit

44:29.959 --> 44:31.584
every week or two.

44:31.670 --> 44:34.453
Other than Nick, she's
really the only other person

44:34.547 --> 44:35.755
I can truly trust.

44:37.884 --> 44:39.625
About most things.

44:39.719 --> 44:40.802
- What does that mean?

44:42.472 --> 44:44.263
- It's nothing, nevermind.

44:45.558 --> 44:46.632
- You know, if there's anything

44:46.726 --> 44:49.802
that I've learned doing therapy,

44:49.896 --> 44:52.605
the one thing that the client
doesn't want to talk about

44:52.691 --> 44:55.358
is exactly what we
should be talking about.

44:57.612 --> 44:59.320
- Um, yeah.

44:59.447 --> 45:02.532
Well, she thinks that I
shouldn't continue seeing you.

45:03.993 --> 45:04.984
- Why is that?

45:05.078 --> 45:05.910
- Um...

45:06.830 --> 45:07.745
Please, don't take offense to
this,

45:07.831 --> 45:11.991
but she said she got a "bad
vibe".

45:12.085 --> 45:14.377
I think it was because of
dinner the other night.

45:14.462 --> 45:15.712
- Beth, you asked me to stay.

45:15.797 --> 45:16.671
- Oh, I know, I know.

45:19.134 --> 45:21.834
I think she just thinks
you're unconventional.

45:21.928 --> 45:25.638
Which, coming from her,
is pretty hilarious.

45:25.724 --> 45:28.674
- You know, sometimes when
we start to get better,

45:28.768 --> 45:31.010
our friends start to be scared

45:31.104 --> 45:33.855
that they're losing the
version of us that they know.

45:35.233 --> 45:36.482
- Hm.

45:36.568 --> 45:37.567
Maybe.

45:37.652 --> 45:40.352
She's very protective.

45:40.447 --> 45:42.780
She actually called Dr.
Ellis to ask about you.

45:43.908 --> 45:47.535
- Oh, and what did Dr. Ellis
have to say?

45:47.662 --> 45:51.914
- He said that you're
great, and I agree with him.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.532
- Well, that's a relief.

45:55.128 --> 45:57.086
So, back to this presentation.

45:57.172 --> 45:58.212
What time is that today?

45:58.339 --> 46:00.047
- Hm, 4 o'clock.

46:00.175 --> 46:02.374
So, four more hours.

46:02.469 --> 46:06.212
All this work, months and
months of hard work pays off.

46:06.306 --> 46:07.972
You know, working in the
corporate world,

46:08.057 --> 46:10.216
it takes a lot out of you.

46:10.310 --> 46:14.312
I have long hours, and I
worry about Jess and Nick.

46:15.482 --> 46:17.940
It's just, it's a lot, so...

46:20.737 --> 46:21.694
I'm grateful for the job,

46:21.780 --> 46:25.397
I'm just, you know, trying to
stay focused

46:25.492 --> 46:26.866
and forget about the attack.

46:31.164 --> 46:32.288
- I'm gonna take my nap for an
hour

46:32.373 --> 46:33.414
before the presentation.

46:34.626 --> 46:36.626
No, I'm just finishing
up some details now.

46:37.545 --> 46:39.245
Okay.

46:39.339 --> 46:40.913
All right, I'll catch you later.

47:27.470 --> 47:28.469
- Marsha?

47:28.596 --> 47:31.180
- Hey, I'm so sorry to
just drop in like this,

47:31.266 --> 47:33.465
but you left your jacket at my
office.

47:33.560 --> 47:34.350
I wanted you to have it.

47:34.435 --> 47:35.634
- That's so nice of you,

47:35.728 --> 47:37.970
but that's actually not my
jacket.

47:38.064 --> 47:38.896
- It's not?

47:39.941 --> 47:41.691
Oh, of course.

47:41.776 --> 47:43.025
I know whose it is.

47:43.111 --> 47:44.819
I'm so sorry that I bothered
you.

47:44.946 --> 47:46.612
- Oh, not at all, that
was really thoughtful.

47:46.698 --> 47:47.479
- Oh.

47:48.283 --> 47:50.149
You know, since I'm here,

47:50.243 --> 47:51.984
I'm supposed to get this to your
husband,

47:52.078 --> 47:53.786
it's for the estate filings.

47:53.872 --> 47:55.371
Save me a stamp?

47:55.456 --> 47:56.330
- Of course.

47:57.584 --> 47:58.499
- I better not.

47:58.626 --> 48:00.501
I realized that I didn't
make myself a copy,

48:00.628 --> 48:02.879
so I'll just get it to him next
week.

48:02.964 --> 48:04.663
- I can make you a copy.

48:04.757 --> 48:05.631
- Are you sure?

48:05.717 --> 48:07.466
I don't want to be any more of a
bother.

48:07.552 --> 48:08.334
- No, I'm sure.

48:08.428 --> 48:09.510
I'll be right back.

48:09.637 --> 48:10.836
- Okay.
- Just one?

48:10.930 --> 48:11.637
- Uh, yeah.

48:11.723 --> 48:12.805
Front and back.

48:12.891 --> 48:14.181
- Okay.
- Thank you.

48:45.298 --> 48:47.798
Oh, Simone, you shouldn't of
done that.

48:50.553 --> 48:52.544
- You didn't date this, but
don't worry,

48:52.639 --> 48:53.879
I fixed it before I made the
copy.

48:53.973 --> 48:56.215
- Oh, thank you so much.

48:56.309 --> 48:57.141
- Sure.

48:57.226 --> 48:58.225
- Good luck with your
presentation.

48:58.353 --> 49:00.811
- Thank you, I'll see you next
week.

49:04.442 --> 49:05.724
- Knock, knock.

49:05.818 --> 49:06.651
It's time.

49:08.321 --> 49:09.395
- Okay.

49:09.489 --> 49:10.905
- You ready?

49:11.032 --> 49:12.114
You got my new slides this
afternoon?

49:12.200 --> 49:14.241
- Yes, and you're sure you
used the updated numbers

49:14.369 --> 49:15.401
for the McCue form?

49:15.495 --> 49:16.568
- I'm sure.

49:16.663 --> 49:17.903
And you made a bullet point

49:17.997 --> 49:19.330
that has the five year
projections?

49:19.415 --> 49:20.331
- Mhm, I did.

49:20.416 --> 49:22.074
- What about that one slide, do
we add-

49:22.168 --> 49:25.002
- Beth, everything we
talked about is done.

49:25.088 --> 49:27.421
Now, let's go in there and
kick some corporate booty.

49:27.548 --> 49:28.714
- Let's do this.

49:28.800 --> 49:29.581
- Great.

49:29.676 --> 49:30.416
- Hello, everyone.

49:30.510 --> 49:31.750
I know we only have a few
minutes,

49:31.844 --> 49:33.419
so I'm gonna jump right in.

49:33.513 --> 49:34.261
Over the last three months,

49:34.389 --> 49:35.930
we've been developing a proposal

49:36.057 --> 49:38.349
for a complete security system
overhaul.

49:40.186 --> 49:42.428
The security breach in
Boston cost the company

49:42.522 --> 49:44.105
six million dollars.

49:46.109 --> 49:47.608
Oh...

49:47.735 --> 49:48.567
I...

49:50.488 --> 49:51.654
I'm sorry, sir.

49:53.074 --> 49:53.698
Let's see...

49:56.452 --> 49:57.952
Oh my gosh, so sorry, sir.

49:59.539 --> 50:00.621
Simone?

50:00.748 --> 50:01.580
- Yeah, yeah.

50:01.666 --> 50:02.957
I don't know...

50:13.344 --> 50:15.761
- What the hell were you doing,
Simone?

50:15.847 --> 50:16.962
Hm?

50:17.056 --> 50:18.222
- Beth, I swear I-

50:18.307 --> 50:21.934
- I know you don't care about
your job, but I need mine.

50:22.020 --> 50:23.969
I have been working on this for
months.

50:24.063 --> 50:25.471
- I know that, okay?

50:25.565 --> 50:26.605
I-

50:26.691 --> 50:28.524
- You know, I can't
believe that I trusted you.

50:28.609 --> 50:29.975
You never wanted to work here,

50:30.069 --> 50:31.819
you never took this job
seriously.

50:31.946 --> 50:33.112
What was I thinking?

50:34.574 --> 50:35.406
- Beth.

50:36.576 --> 50:37.483
Please.

50:37.577 --> 50:39.744
I would never do
something like that, okay?

50:40.747 --> 50:43.497
Beth, you have to believe me.

50:43.624 --> 50:44.665
- It doesn't matter what I
believe, okay?

50:44.792 --> 50:47.960
Now I have to go in there,
and I have to fix this.

50:49.047 --> 50:49.754
- Yeah, yeah, no.

50:49.839 --> 50:51.663
We can still-
- Alone, Simone.

50:51.758 --> 50:54.258
I have to go in there and
I have to fix this alone.

51:12.487 --> 51:14.695
- Hi, this is Simone Mitchell.

51:14.822 --> 51:16.447
I need to talk to Dr. Ellis.

51:18.076 --> 51:19.700
- Thank you for coming.

51:19.827 --> 51:22.536
I'm so sorry about the mix up.

51:22.663 --> 51:24.205
Have a safe flight home.

51:24.332 --> 51:25.915
- Yeah, we'll talk.

52:00.576 --> 52:02.201
- Simone, it's me.

52:02.286 --> 52:03.119
Call me back.

52:04.622 --> 52:05.454
We need to talk.

52:10.169 --> 52:11.794
- See you next week.

52:11.879 --> 52:13.045
- Thank you, Dr. Ellis.

52:56.382 --> 52:57.006
- Enjoying my book?

52:57.091 --> 52:58.632
- Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

52:58.759 --> 52:59.383
I'll be out of here.

52:59.468 --> 53:02.294
- It's okay, it's okay.

53:02.388 --> 53:03.629
It's a best seller, you know?

53:03.723 --> 53:05.181
- Yeah.

53:05.266 --> 53:06.557
- Nice to see you again.

53:07.518 --> 53:08.392
- You as well.

53:10.438 --> 53:12.304
- So gorgeous, isn't it?

53:12.398 --> 53:13.314
- It's amazing.

53:14.275 --> 53:15.816
- You know, you never really
know

53:15.943 --> 53:17.276
what to do with one of these
things

53:17.361 --> 53:19.236
once you win one.

53:48.184 --> 53:49.007
- Simone?

53:49.101 --> 53:51.185
I've been trying to call you all
day.

53:53.105 --> 53:54.605
Will you please call me back?

53:56.150 --> 53:56.982
We need to talk.

54:13.042 --> 54:13.874
Simone?

54:25.429 --> 54:26.303
Hey!

54:26.389 --> 54:28.430
Have you been sleeping in there
all day?

54:29.392 --> 54:30.224
Simone.

54:31.269 --> 54:32.101
Hey, wake up!

54:33.312 --> 54:34.886
Oh, Simone!

54:34.981 --> 54:35.813
Simone!

54:36.857 --> 54:37.648
No, Simone, Simone!

54:37.733 --> 54:39.024
Help!

54:39.110 --> 54:40.526
No!

54:40.611 --> 54:41.360
Help!

54:41.445 --> 54:43.362
Somebody help!

54:43.447 --> 54:44.730
Help!

54:44.824 --> 54:46.064
Somebody!

54:46.158 --> 54:46.949
Simone.

54:48.077 --> 54:49.368
Simone.

54:52.790 --> 54:53.831
No!

54:53.916 --> 54:54.748
Help!

54:55.626 --> 54:56.834
Somebody help!

54:58.004 --> 54:59.211
I hadn't spoke to her all day,

54:59.297 --> 55:02.247
and I was walking down to my
car,

55:02.341 --> 55:04.082
and then I saw her car here

55:04.176 --> 55:06.760
and I thought that she was
asleep.

55:06.887 --> 55:09.847
I opened the door, and she fell
out.

55:09.932 --> 55:10.931
- Mrs. Curtis.

55:11.058 --> 55:11.757
We'll do everything we
can to find the suspect

55:11.851 --> 55:13.091
and bring justice, okay?

55:13.185 --> 55:15.019
- Are you gonna need a ride
home?

55:15.104 --> 55:16.478
- No.

55:16.564 --> 55:17.604
My husband's on his way.

55:17.732 --> 55:20.149
- We'll stay
here until he arrives.

55:20.234 --> 55:21.650
- Thank you.

55:21.736 --> 55:22.443
Thank you.

55:25.573 --> 55:27.573
Do you think it was my attacker?

55:28.451 --> 55:29.941
- It's too early to
say.

55:30.036 --> 55:31.118
- Detectives, please.

55:32.872 --> 55:35.113
- If this was your
attacker showing up again,

55:35.207 --> 55:36.957
it appears to be a revenge
attack.

55:39.462 --> 55:41.119
- Because Simon saved me?

55:41.213 --> 55:43.622
- Again, Mrs. Curtis,
it's too soon to say.

55:43.716 --> 55:44.715
- Then why would, why would-

55:44.800 --> 55:45.632
- Beth.

55:46.552 --> 55:47.426
- Are you okay?

55:48.804 --> 55:49.970
I'm so sorry.

55:51.265 --> 55:52.139
- Hey, sir.

55:52.266 --> 55:53.140
We're gonna do everything we
can, okay?

55:53.267 --> 55:54.892
We already have a few leads,
okay?

55:54.977 --> 55:55.517
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

55:55.603 --> 55:56.518
- Thank you so much.

55:56.604 --> 55:58.562
- We'll be in touch.
- Thank you.

55:58.647 --> 55:59.188
Come on, honey.

55:59.273 --> 56:00.981
Let's get you home.

56:01.108 --> 56:02.232
I brought you some tea.

56:03.069 --> 56:04.151
- Thank you.

56:04.278 --> 56:05.027
- Are you warm enough?

56:05.112 --> 56:05.736
- I'm fine.

56:05.821 --> 56:07.071
- I'll get you a sweater.

56:07.156 --> 56:08.489
- I said I'm fine.

56:09.450 --> 56:10.649
- I can't do anything for you?

56:10.743 --> 56:12.951
- No, there's nothing anyone can
do.

56:13.913 --> 56:15.788
I need some space right now.

56:15.873 --> 56:16.747
- I understand.

56:18.626 --> 56:20.000
Well, I'm here if you need me,
okay?

56:20.127 --> 56:21.668
- Hey, Nick, please.

56:21.796 --> 56:23.662
I just need some space, okay?

56:23.756 --> 56:25.881
I just want to be alone right
now.

56:36.435 --> 56:39.228
- Beth, I am so sorry.

56:39.313 --> 56:40.479
How awful.

56:41.732 --> 56:43.849
Do you know what happened?

56:43.943 --> 56:44.858
- Um...

56:46.028 --> 56:50.906
The police think that my
attacker might've come back.

56:52.451 --> 56:54.076
That he came back looking for
me.

56:55.162 --> 56:57.329
- Oh, that must be very
frightening.

56:57.415 --> 56:58.247
- It is.

56:59.458 --> 57:00.791
But I think that the worse part
is

57:00.876 --> 57:02.793
just the sense of deja vu.

57:04.380 --> 57:05.295
- How do you mean?

57:06.424 --> 57:09.258
- I mean, I've been through
all of this already.

57:10.344 --> 57:12.845
Being frightened just to walk to
my car,

57:12.930 --> 57:15.055
being asked how I'm doing.

57:15.182 --> 57:16.974
You know, I fight every single
morning

57:17.059 --> 57:19.351
just to put on a brave face.

57:19.437 --> 57:20.602
I can't stand it.

57:21.730 --> 57:23.939
I can't stand going through
this all over again,

57:24.024 --> 57:25.774
I just want to be left alone.

57:27.403 --> 57:28.235
You know, even with Nick,

57:28.362 --> 57:29.736
I keep telling him that I need
space,

57:29.864 --> 57:33.449
but I think he's having a
hard time accepting that.

57:34.660 --> 57:38.871
You know, he just wants
to help, but he can't.

57:39.957 --> 57:41.248
He's just making it worse.

57:45.212 --> 57:47.913
- You know, it's difficult to
watch

57:48.007 --> 57:51.592
someone that you love
be in pain, be hurting,

57:51.719 --> 57:53.218
and not be able to help.

57:55.014 --> 57:55.846
- I know.

57:57.683 --> 57:58.432
But the best thing for me right
now

57:58.559 --> 58:01.351
is just to let me mourn in
peace.

58:08.527 --> 58:09.267
- Hey!

58:09.361 --> 58:10.194
- Marsha!

58:10.279 --> 58:12.437
- Glad to find you working so
late.

58:12.531 --> 58:13.739
I was just driving by,

58:13.824 --> 58:15.782
I thought I'd drop off the
approvals that we talked about.

58:15.910 --> 58:16.617
- Oh, thank you.

58:16.744 --> 58:17.442
Yeah, have a seat.

58:17.536 --> 58:18.777
Thanks.

58:18.871 --> 58:21.279
- So, how are you?

58:21.373 --> 58:22.789
I heard about Simone.

58:23.667 --> 58:24.500
- It's awful, isn't it?

58:24.585 --> 58:26.126
- Yeah, are you doing
okay?

58:26.253 --> 58:28.170
- I'm fine, but poor Beth, you
know,

58:28.255 --> 58:30.956
that this guy came back for
her, it's just really scary.

58:31.050 --> 58:33.792
- Oh, it must've been terrible
to see her go through that.

58:33.886 --> 58:36.136
- Yeah, I wish I can
help.

58:36.263 --> 58:38.797
- Well, she just needs to know
that you're there for her.

58:38.891 --> 58:39.806
- Yeah.

58:39.934 --> 58:42.559
- Actually, I really
shouldn't say anything

58:42.645 --> 58:43.936
about this but-

58:44.021 --> 58:46.188
- Say anything about what?

58:48.359 --> 58:51.309
- Does Beth seem like herself
right now?

58:51.403 --> 58:52.644
- What do you mean?

58:52.738 --> 58:55.146
- No one can really know that
I talked to you about this,

58:55.241 --> 58:56.740
it would be unethical.

58:56.825 --> 58:59.618
- Marsha, I'm not comfortable
with that.

58:59.703 --> 59:00.819
- I understand.

59:00.913 --> 59:04.122
And if it wasn't so important
I wouldn't say anything.

59:05.125 --> 59:07.000
But I just need you make sure

59:07.127 --> 59:10.495
that you're keeping a really
close eye on Beth right now.

59:10.589 --> 59:12.163
- What are you saying?

59:12.258 --> 59:14.091
Is she gonna hurt herself?

59:14.176 --> 59:16.301
- I can't go into detail about
it,

59:16.387 --> 59:19.805
but just be there to support
her.

59:19.890 --> 59:23.058
Even if she pushes you
away, you need to be there.

59:23.143 --> 59:25.894
With everything that she's gone
through,

59:25.980 --> 59:27.729
it just wouldn't be unexpected

59:27.815 --> 59:29.481
for her to blame herself.

59:30.609 --> 59:32.943
- Is Beth blaming herself for
this?

59:33.028 --> 59:33.902
- I can't say too much,

59:33.988 --> 59:37.188
but Simone saved her from her
attacker,

59:37.283 --> 59:40.284
and then when he came back for
her-

59:40.369 --> 59:42.861
- I never even thought
about that, poor Beth.

59:42.955 --> 59:43.912
- Yeah.

59:43.998 --> 59:46.197
Well, just be sure you're
checking up on her.

59:46.292 --> 59:49.084
Just let her know that you care
enough

59:49.169 --> 59:51.253
to just push through all those
barriers

59:51.338 --> 59:52.379
that she's created.

59:52.506 --> 59:55.373
- She has been distant lately.

59:55.467 --> 59:56.374
- Yeah.

59:56.468 --> 59:57.884
What she needs right now is her
family.

59:58.012 --> 59:59.678
She needs to know you're there.

59:59.763 --> 1:00:00.887
- Thanks, Marsha, I really
appreciate it.

1:00:01.015 --> 1:00:03.682
- Nick, something is seriously
wrong with these numbers.

1:00:03.767 --> 1:00:05.058
Marsha, hi, um...

1:00:06.186 --> 1:00:07.227
Do we have a meeting scheduled?

1:00:07.354 --> 1:00:10.272
- Marsha was just dropping
off some signatures.

1:00:10.357 --> 1:00:11.940
- Actually, while you're here,

1:00:12.026 --> 1:00:13.725
we have some questions about the
estate.

1:00:13.819 --> 1:00:14.893
It'll just take a couple of
minutes.

1:00:14.987 --> 1:00:17.738
- Well, actually, you know, I've
gotta run

1:00:17.865 --> 1:00:21.066
but maybe we could set
something up for next week?

1:00:21.160 --> 1:00:22.242
- Well...

1:00:22.369 --> 1:00:24.745
- Nick, let me know if I can
do anything else to help.

1:00:24.872 --> 1:00:25.871
- Of course, thanks.

1:00:31.378 --> 1:00:32.210
- What was that about?

1:00:32.296 --> 1:00:33.879
- Nothing, just a personal
matter.

1:00:33.964 --> 1:00:34.630
What's going on?

1:00:34.715 --> 1:00:36.048
- Take a look at these.

1:00:41.180 --> 1:00:43.055
- Looks like there's an
issue with the audit.

1:00:43.140 --> 1:00:45.807
- Did she say anything
about it while she was here?

1:00:45.893 --> 1:00:49.094
I have not been able to
reach her financial guy.

1:00:49.188 --> 1:00:51.813
- No, no, but I'll ask her about
it.

1:00:51.899 --> 1:00:52.939
- Make sure you do.

1:00:54.026 --> 1:00:56.068
Can't move forward until
this is squared away.

1:00:57.446 --> 1:00:58.278
Keep it.

1:01:00.240 --> 1:01:01.606
- You bet.

1:01:15.589 --> 1:01:17.089
Hey there.

1:01:17.174 --> 1:01:18.289
- Hey.

1:01:18.384 --> 1:01:19.591
- How you feelin'?

1:01:24.181 --> 1:01:25.797
- This was the company picnic
this summer.

1:01:25.891 --> 1:01:27.799
Simone hired a magician and a
clown

1:01:27.893 --> 1:01:29.059
and didn't tell them about each
other.

1:01:29.144 --> 1:01:30.769
- I remember that.

1:01:30.854 --> 1:01:32.971
I've never seen a clown
get so territorial before.

1:01:35.943 --> 1:01:37.442
- I can't believe she's gone.

1:01:38.320 --> 1:01:38.985
- I know.

1:01:40.906 --> 1:01:42.480
Do you want to talk about it?

1:01:42.574 --> 1:01:44.241
- I told you, Nick.

1:01:44.326 --> 1:01:45.784
I do want to talk about it.

1:01:45.869 --> 1:01:48.495
I just need some time to
process it on my own first.

1:01:49.373 --> 1:01:51.489
- Beth, I'm your husband.

1:01:51.583 --> 1:01:53.709
I'm here for you, I'm
listening whenever you-

1:01:53.794 --> 1:01:56.128
- I know, and I appreciate that.

1:01:57.798 --> 1:01:58.755
I'm just not ready.

1:02:00.968 --> 1:02:05.429
- I just don't want you to
bottle everything up inside and-

1:02:05.514 --> 1:02:06.304
- Okay, Nick.

1:02:06.390 --> 1:02:08.223
You said that you want to
listen,

1:02:08.308 --> 1:02:09.933
so why don't you just listen?

1:02:10.018 --> 1:02:11.810
Okay, I don't want to talk.

1:02:11.895 --> 1:02:14.104
- Beth, you can't blame
yourself.

1:02:16.442 --> 1:02:17.065
- What?

1:02:17.151 --> 1:02:18.150
- Look, I know this is hard,

1:02:18.235 --> 1:02:20.277
but you're feeling like you
caused this

1:02:20.362 --> 1:02:22.353
or like it should've
been you somehow is just-

1:02:22.448 --> 1:02:23.947
- How can you even say that?

1:02:24.032 --> 1:02:25.031
Nick, it almost was me.

1:02:25.159 --> 1:02:27.576
- And it's natural to
feel guilty about that.

1:02:27.661 --> 1:02:29.161
- For what?

1:02:29.246 --> 1:02:32.030
I was attacked, and my best
friend died,

1:02:32.124 --> 1:02:34.332
and somehow you think
that this is my fault?

1:02:34.418 --> 1:02:35.459
- Of course I don't think it's
your fault.

1:02:35.544 --> 1:02:38.369
I just don't want you
to think that either.

1:02:38.464 --> 1:02:39.421
- Thanks, Nick.

1:02:39.506 --> 1:02:40.922
Thanks for telling me
what you think I feel

1:02:41.008 --> 1:02:41.715
but shouldn't feel.

1:02:41.842 --> 1:02:42.707
Thank you, thanks for that.

1:02:42.801 --> 1:02:45.302
- I'm just trying to help, Beth.

1:02:45.387 --> 1:02:46.470
- Well, stop!

1:02:48.640 --> 1:02:49.431
Please.

1:02:51.810 --> 1:02:52.601
Just stop.

1:02:56.774 --> 1:02:58.064
- Beth, come on.

1:03:10.746 --> 1:03:11.495
- Hi, it's me.

1:03:11.580 --> 1:03:12.412
Leave a message.

1:03:14.041 --> 1:03:15.207
- Hey, listen.

1:03:15.292 --> 1:03:18.627
I got a couple of questions
regarding the documents.

1:03:18.712 --> 1:03:20.587
It may be just a clerical error.

1:03:20.714 --> 1:03:21.630
Call me back.

1:03:38.857 --> 1:03:39.773
- Hey, Mom.

1:03:43.153 --> 1:03:44.486
Are you okay?

1:03:47.950 --> 1:03:48.606
I know.

1:03:48.700 --> 1:03:49.908
I can't believe she's gone.

1:03:51.912 --> 1:03:53.954
You know, I keep thinking
about every Halloween

1:03:54.081 --> 1:03:55.947
when she would come over dressed
up as-

1:03:56.041 --> 1:03:56.957
- Like a zombie chicken.

1:03:57.084 --> 1:03:59.000
- Yeah, or the ghost of the
Easter Bunny.

1:04:00.587 --> 1:04:02.453
- She loved spending Halloween
with you.

1:04:02.548 --> 1:04:03.463
- I loved it too.

1:04:06.885 --> 1:04:09.761
- So, SATs are tomorrow.

1:04:09.847 --> 1:04:10.679
Are you ready?

1:04:12.057 --> 1:04:13.265
- I hope so.

1:04:13.350 --> 1:04:15.767
Carmen and I are gonna spend
the night totally destressing,

1:04:15.853 --> 1:04:17.135
relaxing before tomorrow.

1:04:17.229 --> 1:04:17.853
So...

1:04:17.938 --> 1:04:19.312
- You certainly earned it.

1:04:21.066 --> 1:04:21.857
- I hope so.

1:04:22.734 --> 1:04:23.608
- Jess.

1:04:24.653 --> 1:04:27.571
No matter what happens, I'm
proud of you.

1:04:29.199 --> 1:04:29.948
- Thanks, Mom.

1:04:31.618 --> 1:04:33.151
I'll see you later, okay?

1:04:33.245 --> 1:04:33.994
- Okay.

1:04:51.013 --> 1:04:51.553
- Mrs. Curtis.

1:04:51.638 --> 1:04:52.429
- Detective.

1:04:52.514 --> 1:04:53.972
- Do you have a minute?

1:04:54.057 --> 1:04:55.840
- Yes, please.

1:04:55.934 --> 1:04:56.725
Come inside.

1:04:58.353 --> 1:04:59.185
This way.

1:05:02.232 --> 1:05:03.348
You caught him?

1:05:03.442 --> 1:05:05.650
- We picked up a suspect a
few miles from your office

1:05:05.736 --> 1:05:06.902
following another attack.

1:05:06.987 --> 1:05:08.236
He confessed last night.

1:05:09.948 --> 1:05:10.864
- Thank God.

1:05:11.950 --> 1:05:14.025
- There's still something
we need to discuss.

1:05:14.119 --> 1:05:15.785
- I'd love to help with
an ID, but Detective-

1:05:15.871 --> 1:05:17.913
- No, it's not that, it's about
Simone.

1:05:18.916 --> 1:05:20.365
- What about her?

1:05:20.459 --> 1:05:22.033
- Our suspect confessed to the
attacks,

1:05:22.127 --> 1:05:24.035
but he claims he didn't attack
Simone.

1:05:24.129 --> 1:05:26.463
We're checking his alibi right
now.

1:05:26.548 --> 1:05:27.631
- Alibi?

1:05:27.716 --> 1:05:30.634
- Yes, he says he was out
of state, in North Dakota,

1:05:30.719 --> 1:05:32.543
attending his grandmother's
wake.

1:05:32.638 --> 1:05:33.803
- I don't understand.

1:05:35.390 --> 1:05:38.433
- Whoever killed Simone, I
don't believe it was him.

1:05:40.145 --> 1:05:42.053
- Then her killer's still out
there?

1:05:42.147 --> 1:05:44.389
- When was the last time you saw
Simone?

1:05:44.483 --> 1:05:47.567
- Um, we had a presentation at
my office

1:05:47.694 --> 1:05:48.944
the afternoon that she...

1:05:50.739 --> 1:05:51.613
That afternoon.

1:05:52.574 --> 1:05:54.232
- I understand from your
colleagues that

1:05:54.326 --> 1:05:56.242
you and Simone had a fight?

1:05:56.370 --> 1:05:59.079
- There was a problem
with the presentation,

1:05:59.206 --> 1:06:00.830
we exchanged a few words.

1:06:00.916 --> 1:06:03.241
- Wait, so there was a fight
and you exchanged words,

1:06:03.335 --> 1:06:04.742
and you didn't talk to her after
that?

1:06:04.836 --> 1:06:06.628
- No, I...

1:06:06.713 --> 1:06:09.214
Why are you asking me these
questions?

1:06:09.299 --> 1:06:10.924
Detective, am I a suspect?

1:06:13.053 --> 1:06:14.094
- Not at this time.

1:06:15.097 --> 1:06:17.180
But guarantee, we'll have more
questions.

1:06:21.853 --> 1:06:23.979
- You have my number if
you need anything else.

1:06:24.064 --> 1:06:25.271
Thank you for your time.

1:06:25.399 --> 1:06:26.398
- We'll be in touch.

1:06:32.447 --> 1:06:33.905
- Beth!

1:06:33.991 --> 1:06:35.773
Come in, I was about to call
you.

1:06:35.867 --> 1:06:37.701
- I had to stop for coffee.

1:06:37.786 --> 1:06:39.610
I haven't been sleeping at
night.

1:06:39.705 --> 1:06:41.538
- Well, I would've brewed you
some.

1:06:41.623 --> 1:06:43.331
- A triple shot of espresso.

1:06:43.417 --> 1:06:44.249
- Oh.

1:06:44.334 --> 1:06:45.583
That bad, huh?

1:06:45.669 --> 1:06:46.626
- Mm.

1:06:47.587 --> 1:06:49.421
They found the man who was my
attacker.

1:06:51.174 --> 1:06:51.956
- Wow.

1:06:52.050 --> 1:06:53.091
Well, how did they know it's
him?

1:06:53.176 --> 1:06:54.300
- He confessed.

1:06:57.597 --> 1:06:59.639
- Well, that must be a relief.

1:06:59.766 --> 1:07:02.767
- But they don't think it's
the same man who killed Simone.

1:07:03.645 --> 1:07:05.520
- Why would they think that?

1:07:05.605 --> 1:07:07.439
- Well, he has an alibi.

1:07:07.524 --> 1:07:09.649
You know, I've been going
over and over it in my head

1:07:09.776 --> 1:07:12.193
and it doesn't make any sense.

1:07:12.279 --> 1:07:14.237
I mean, who would want to hurt
Simone?

1:07:15.449 --> 1:07:17.315
- I understand your confusion.

1:07:17.409 --> 1:07:18.825
- I mean, she had no enemies.

1:07:20.579 --> 1:07:22.820
- Well, sometimes it's difficult
for us

1:07:22.914 --> 1:07:25.248
to see the flaws in people that
we love.

1:07:26.126 --> 1:07:27.375
- I don't understand.

1:07:28.503 --> 1:07:30.828
- Well, you have to
remember that I met Simone,

1:07:30.922 --> 1:07:34.132
and while I'm sure that she
was a wonderful friend to you-

1:07:34.217 --> 1:07:36.176
- Yes, she was.

1:07:36.303 --> 1:07:41.306
- She also had the capacity
to be quite rude and abrasive.

1:07:43.268 --> 1:07:44.350
- What are you saying?

1:07:44.478 --> 1:07:47.845
- Well, it's possible that
she made someone angry.

1:07:47.939 --> 1:07:50.148
Some people don't respond well
to that.

1:07:50.233 --> 1:07:53.109
Possibly she said the wrong
thing at the wrong time,

1:07:53.195 --> 1:07:55.570
and she suffered the
consequences.

1:07:55.655 --> 1:07:58.948
- So you're saying that she
deserved this?

1:07:59.034 --> 1:08:01.534
You're talking about my
best friend who just died.

1:08:02.788 --> 1:08:04.862
- I understand, Beth.

1:08:04.956 --> 1:08:09.367
And I know this is a very
difficult time for you.

1:08:09.461 --> 1:08:12.036
And I am just trying
to help you understand.

1:08:12.130 --> 1:08:15.256
- Well, you're not
helping, no one is helping.

1:08:17.135 --> 1:08:18.876
I mean, ever since I
started talking to you,

1:08:18.970 --> 1:08:20.428
things just seem to get worse.

1:08:20.514 --> 1:08:23.047
- I understand that it
could feel that way, Beth,

1:08:23.141 --> 1:08:25.716
but you've been under a lot of
stress.

1:08:25.811 --> 1:08:29.395
You had the attack and the
relationship with your daughter,

1:08:29.523 --> 1:08:32.649
now Simone, and then your
presentation.

1:08:32.734 --> 1:08:33.566
- Wait.

1:08:34.903 --> 1:08:36.069
My presentation?

1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:39.197
- To your CEO.

1:08:42.119 --> 1:08:44.202
- When did we talk about my
presentation?

1:08:47.124 --> 1:08:49.073
- I have it right here.

1:08:49.167 --> 1:08:52.919
We talked about it the
day after it happened.

1:08:53.046 --> 1:08:55.547
You were talking about Simone
and...

1:08:56.842 --> 1:08:57.715
Listen.

1:08:58.802 --> 1:09:00.418
I wouldn't be surprised
if you'd forgotten.

1:09:00.512 --> 1:09:03.221
You have been under so much
stress lately.

1:09:03.306 --> 1:09:04.139
- Right.

1:09:06.560 --> 1:09:08.017
- Beth, I think it would be
helpful

1:09:08.103 --> 1:09:09.686
if we processed your
relationship-

1:09:09.771 --> 1:09:12.647
- You know, Marsha, I have to
go.

1:09:12.732 --> 1:09:14.098
- Go?

1:09:14.192 --> 1:09:15.275
- Yeah.

1:09:15.402 --> 1:09:17.610
You mentioned my presentation
and I just remembered

1:09:17.737 --> 1:09:18.936
that I'm supposed to be
in a conference call.

1:09:19.030 --> 1:09:19.904
- No, Beth-

1:09:19.990 --> 1:09:21.531
- I'm picking up the slack for
Simone,

1:09:21.616 --> 1:09:23.616
so I am so busy, I'm sorry.

1:09:23.743 --> 1:09:24.492
- Beth, I really feel like you
should-

1:09:24.578 --> 1:09:26.452
- I'll see you at our next
session?

1:09:28.331 --> 1:09:29.539
- If you're sure.

1:09:29.624 --> 1:09:30.707
- See you then.

1:10:17.297 --> 1:10:18.129
What?

1:10:19.049 --> 1:10:20.757
48 hours ago?

1:10:20.842 --> 1:10:23.885
- I'm so sorry to just
drop in like this but...

1:10:23.970 --> 1:10:25.261
- That doesn't make sense.

1:10:41.154 --> 1:10:42.186
I need to talk to you.

1:10:42.280 --> 1:10:43.238
- I know.

1:10:43.323 --> 1:10:44.113
- You know?

1:10:44.199 --> 1:10:45.031
What do you know?

1:10:45.158 --> 1:10:46.524
- Please, just come inside,
please.

1:10:46.618 --> 1:10:47.575
- It's okay, Jess.

1:10:47.661 --> 1:10:49.744
We're gonna get your
mom the help she needs.

1:10:52.165 --> 1:10:53.197
- Get out of my house.

1:10:53.291 --> 1:10:54.332
- Bethany, please.

1:10:54.417 --> 1:10:55.700
- It's all right.

1:10:55.794 --> 1:10:58.202
I warned you she might be
resistant.

1:10:58.296 --> 1:10:59.963
Beth, we're only here to help.

1:11:00.799 --> 1:11:01.798
- Help?

1:11:01.883 --> 1:11:02.715
Help?

1:11:02.842 --> 1:11:04.759
She sabotaged my work
presentation.

1:11:04.844 --> 1:11:05.551
- Beth, please.

1:11:05.679 --> 1:11:06.719
- She did it!
- Just sit down.

1:11:06.846 --> 1:11:07.845
Hear us out, please.

1:11:08.848 --> 1:11:10.765
- She's messing with my life.

1:11:10.850 --> 1:11:14.060
- Beth, you have been under
an enormous amount of stress.

1:11:14.187 --> 1:11:15.886
It's no wonder you're trying to
cope.

1:11:15.981 --> 1:11:17.221
You're blaming other people.

1:11:17.315 --> 1:11:18.773
- I'm not blaming anyone, okay?

1:11:18.858 --> 1:11:20.650
She did it.

1:11:20.735 --> 1:11:21.526
What do you want?

1:11:21.611 --> 1:11:23.060
- Mom!

1:11:23.154 --> 1:11:24.112
Please.

1:11:24.197 --> 1:11:26.531
- All any of us wants is
to get you some support.

1:11:26.616 --> 1:11:28.232
- No, I need you out
of my house right now.

1:11:28.326 --> 1:11:29.909
- Beth, listen to yourself!

1:11:30.036 --> 1:11:30.735
You need help.

1:11:30.829 --> 1:11:31.494
- No, I don't need help,

1:11:31.579 --> 1:11:32.996
I need you to listen to me.

1:11:33.081 --> 1:11:33.997
- Beth.

1:11:34.082 --> 1:11:34.956
- Now-
- Beth!

1:11:36.126 --> 1:11:37.375
You need help.

1:11:39.671 --> 1:11:42.630
I can't let you stay here unless
you are willing to get it.

1:11:43.633 --> 1:11:44.465
- You can't kick me out of my
own house.

1:11:44.551 --> 1:11:46.968
- Sorry, I am protecting our
daughter.

1:11:48.013 --> 1:11:49.012
- I can explain everything.

1:11:49.097 --> 1:11:51.097
- Beth, please, just stay
somewhere else tonight

1:11:51.224 --> 1:11:53.308
and we will talk about this
tomorrow.

1:11:54.686 --> 1:11:56.477
I don't want to have to call
someone.

1:11:57.772 --> 1:11:58.771
- No, sweetheart.

1:12:00.233 --> 1:12:00.982
Aw, sweetie.

1:12:01.067 --> 1:12:03.601
Aw, honey.

1:12:03.695 --> 1:12:04.485
Come here.

1:12:04.571 --> 1:12:06.029
It's gonna be fine.

1:12:08.533 --> 1:12:09.824
Shh, shh.

1:12:09.909 --> 1:12:10.775
It's fine.

1:12:10.869 --> 1:12:12.660
Good luck on your test tomorrow,
okay?

1:12:28.136 --> 1:12:29.177
This isn't over.

1:12:30.388 --> 1:12:31.804
Get out of my house.

1:12:49.074 --> 1:12:50.815
- I cannot believe I
didn't see this coming.

1:12:50.909 --> 1:12:51.783
- Oh...

1:12:52.869 --> 1:12:55.745
It's okay, Nick, it
was a long time coming.

1:12:57.290 --> 1:12:58.581
It's gonna be okay.

1:12:59.626 --> 1:13:00.541
I promise.

1:13:01.920 --> 1:13:05.004
- Sorry.

1:13:35.203 --> 1:13:36.536
- Marsha Davies.

1:13:45.213 --> 1:13:46.045
Yearbook.

1:13:59.102 --> 1:13:59.892
What?

1:14:03.773 --> 1:14:05.064
That's not you.

1:14:09.028 --> 1:14:10.820
Marsha Davies.

1:14:14.033 --> 1:14:15.867
Local therapist missing.

1:14:19.873 --> 1:14:20.830
Nick, Jess.

1:14:22.709 --> 1:14:23.741
Detective Stringer?

1:14:23.835 --> 1:14:25.877
It's Beth Curtis, call me back.

1:14:25.962 --> 1:14:28.045
I need you to meet me at my
house, please.

1:14:32.635 --> 1:14:33.301
- Hello?

1:14:33.386 --> 1:14:34.594
- We are in major trouble, Nick.

1:14:37.056 --> 1:14:38.431
- Call Jess.

1:14:38.558 --> 1:14:40.349
- Calling
Jess.

1:14:42.896 --> 1:14:43.761
- Mom?

1:14:43.855 --> 1:14:45.521
- Jess, I need you to listen to
me.

1:14:45.607 --> 1:14:47.982
- Mom, what's going on?

1:14:48.067 --> 1:14:49.734
- She's not who she says she is.

1:14:50.653 --> 1:14:51.486
- Mom, I don't understand.

1:14:51.571 --> 1:14:54.447
- Jess, I know what Marsha told
you.

1:14:54.574 --> 1:14:56.407
She's lying to you.

1:14:56.493 --> 1:14:57.116
Okay?

1:14:57.243 --> 1:14:58.367
I need you to trust me.

1:14:58.453 --> 1:14:59.452
Can you do that?

1:15:01.372 --> 1:15:02.205
- Go ahead.

1:15:03.583 --> 1:15:05.708
- I think that she may have hurt
Simone,

1:15:05.793 --> 1:15:07.960
and I think that she may try to
hurt you.

1:15:08.087 --> 1:15:10.588
I need you to go and get Daddy
right now.

1:15:13.635 --> 1:15:14.625
- Okay, okay.

1:15:14.719 --> 1:15:16.385
- Wait, wait, wait, what
are you talking about?

1:15:16.471 --> 1:15:17.461
- Marsha Davies.

1:15:17.555 --> 1:15:19.296
The title clearance came
back on that property

1:15:19.390 --> 1:15:20.723
she inherited from her father.

1:15:20.808 --> 1:15:21.966
- And?

1:15:22.060 --> 1:15:24.310
- And he's not her father,
and he's not freakin' dead.

1:15:25.188 --> 1:15:26.771
- No, no, that's not possible.

1:15:26.856 --> 1:15:27.522
Let me give her a call.

1:15:27.607 --> 1:15:28.564
- Call her whenever you want.

1:15:28.650 --> 1:15:30.191
I don't know who she is or what
she is,

1:15:30.276 --> 1:15:32.142
but she screwed us, pal.

1:15:32.237 --> 1:15:32.944
- Why would she do that?

1:15:33.029 --> 1:15:33.986
- She's crazy.

1:15:34.113 --> 1:15:36.239
- Trevor, we met with
her, she's not crazy,

1:15:36.324 --> 1:15:37.240
I'm telling you...

1:15:40.870 --> 1:15:42.870
- Did somebody fall down?

1:15:42.956 --> 1:15:44.622
- Nick?

1:15:44.707 --> 1:15:45.498
Nick?

1:15:49.254 --> 1:15:49.961
- Oh...

1:15:56.427 --> 1:15:57.885
- Yes, I'm going right now!

1:16:01.474 --> 1:16:02.840
Daddy!

1:16:02.934 --> 1:16:03.724
- Jess!

1:16:13.736 --> 1:16:14.852
Jess.

1:16:14.946 --> 1:16:16.112
Jess, are you there?

1:16:16.197 --> 1:16:17.071
What's going on?

1:16:19.200 --> 1:16:20.032
Jess.

1:16:21.160 --> 1:16:24.361
- Sorry, Jess can't come
to the phone right now.

1:16:24.455 --> 1:16:25.696
- Marsha.

1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:31.201
- Not Marsha, but I think
you already figured that out.

1:16:31.296 --> 1:16:32.369
- You...

1:16:32.463 --> 1:16:33.963
If you hurt my family...

1:16:34.966 --> 1:16:36.757
- Hurt your family?

1:16:36.843 --> 1:16:40.044
Oh, we both know that that's
your job.

1:16:40.138 --> 1:16:44.381
Pushing away your husband,
judging your daughter.

1:16:45.393 --> 1:16:48.052
My job is to put them
out of their suffering.

1:16:48.146 --> 1:16:50.146
We'll see you when you
get home, sweetheart.

1:16:51.149 --> 1:16:52.023
- Wait!

1:16:52.108 --> 1:16:53.649
No!

1:16:53.735 --> 1:16:57.236
- Jess!

1:17:03.119 --> 1:17:04.285
Jess?

1:17:05.371 --> 1:17:07.404
Oh, which way did she go?

1:17:07.498 --> 1:17:09.206
Did she go this way?

1:17:11.169 --> 1:17:12.043
Jess!

1:17:14.339 --> 1:17:16.881
Come on, Jess, don't play with
me.

1:17:16.966 --> 1:17:17.798
Jess?

1:17:21.512 --> 1:17:24.755
Come out, come out, wherever you
are!

1:17:24.849 --> 1:17:27.591
Your mother told me how you
like to make things difficult,

1:17:27.685 --> 1:17:29.518
but let's not draw this out!

1:17:53.503 --> 1:17:54.627
- I'm coming.

1:17:56.714 --> 1:17:58.130
- Come on out, little girl.

1:17:58.257 --> 1:18:00.341
It's gonna be easier this way.

1:18:02.053 --> 1:18:06.222
Your mom said you're never
gonna amount to anything anyway!

1:18:07.100 --> 1:18:09.809
Too much baggage for this world!

1:18:09.936 --> 1:18:11.977
I'll be doing the world a favor.

1:18:12.105 --> 1:18:13.688
You know, it'll be easier on
your mom

1:18:13.773 --> 1:18:15.189
to have you gone.

1:18:16.401 --> 1:18:18.109
I don't blame her.

1:18:18.194 --> 1:18:23.239
Because the truth is,
you're just not very bright!

1:18:50.727 --> 1:18:54.770
Oh, oh, you were one of the
lucky ones, you hear me?

1:18:54.856 --> 1:18:56.439
You're lucky, but you
didn't appreciate it!

1:18:56.524 --> 1:18:57.982
Your parents gave you
everything,

1:18:58.067 --> 1:19:00.025
and how do you repay them?

1:19:00.153 --> 1:19:04.238
Ingratitude, disrespect,
drinking.

1:19:05.366 --> 1:19:07.408
They won't miss you at all.

1:19:12.707 --> 1:19:13.539
Jess!

1:19:13.666 --> 1:19:16.200
Come on baby, come on.
- My ankle.

1:19:16.294 --> 1:19:18.035
Come on, let's go.

1:19:18.129 --> 1:19:19.795
Let's go, come on.

1:19:19.881 --> 1:19:20.713
Come on.

1:19:22.550 --> 1:19:25.134
Nick!

1:19:25.219 --> 1:19:29.346
Come on.

1:19:29.432 --> 1:19:30.681
- Daddy!

1:19:30.767 --> 1:19:33.601
- He's breathing.
- Daddy!

1:19:33.686 --> 1:19:34.384
- His phone is dead.

1:19:34.479 --> 1:19:35.719
Go call an ambulance.

1:19:35.813 --> 1:19:37.021
Go, go!

1:19:37.106 --> 1:19:38.555
Come on, wake up!

1:19:45.823 --> 1:19:48.199
- Oh, it's just you and me,
Beth.

1:19:49.202 --> 1:19:51.494
- Oh, why are you doing this?

1:19:51.579 --> 1:19:52.286
- Why?

1:19:52.371 --> 1:19:53.245
- Yeah, why?

1:19:53.372 --> 1:19:54.914
- Oh, everyone knows that a good
therapist

1:19:55.041 --> 1:19:57.074
doesn't give you the answers.

1:19:57.168 --> 1:20:00.252
She leads you to find
them out for yourself.

1:20:00.379 --> 1:20:01.253
- You're not a therapist.

1:20:01.380 --> 1:20:03.422
- Oh, no, that is true!

1:20:04.467 --> 1:20:07.927
But I've had enough therapy
to be pretty good at it!

1:20:08.054 --> 1:20:10.262
I had you convinced.

1:20:10.389 --> 1:20:12.014
- What's wrong with you?

1:20:12.099 --> 1:20:14.058
- Depends on who you ask.

1:20:15.186 --> 1:20:16.426
Well, let's see...

1:20:16.521 --> 1:20:20.064
We have reactive detachment
disorder

1:20:20.149 --> 1:20:22.149
when I was 7 years old.

1:20:22.235 --> 1:20:26.987
Oh, then we have intermittent
explosive disorder

1:20:27.990 --> 1:20:29.606
when I was 12.

1:20:29.700 --> 1:20:32.276
Oh, and then narcissistic
personality disorder

1:20:32.370 --> 1:20:34.286
by the time I was 17.

1:20:34.413 --> 1:20:38.165
Oh, then we have antisocial
personality disorder.

1:20:38.251 --> 1:20:40.960
Oh, that one hurt, Beth.

1:20:41.087 --> 1:20:45.122
They said that I was
superficially charming.

1:20:45.216 --> 1:20:45.789
I mean, can you imagine?

1:20:45.883 --> 1:20:47.958
Superficially charming?

1:20:48.052 --> 1:20:50.636
Do I seem superficially charming
to you?

1:20:51.806 --> 1:20:54.515
Yeah, I mean, Marsha
didn't think so either,

1:20:54.600 --> 1:20:56.475
well, not until the very end,

1:20:56.602 --> 1:21:01.605
when I had her strangled
right at her very own desk.

1:21:03.860 --> 1:21:05.642
You're a liar!

1:21:05.736 --> 1:21:09.989
Oh, and there I was cleaning
up the mess and I find you.

1:21:11.409 --> 1:21:15.077
Poor, little frightened thing,
so lost.

1:21:17.456 --> 1:21:18.322
I saw myself in you,

1:21:18.416 --> 1:21:21.625
I couldn't let you sit out there
alone.

1:21:23.921 --> 1:21:25.754
- No, you're wrong, I needed the
help.

1:21:25.840 --> 1:21:26.839
- Why?

1:21:26.966 --> 1:21:28.883
'Cause somebody frightened you?

1:21:30.261 --> 1:21:32.836
Aw, because somebody disrupted

1:21:32.930 --> 1:21:36.181
your perfect little life, huh?

1:21:36.309 --> 1:21:38.142
What, you have a loving husband,

1:21:38.227 --> 1:21:40.895
you have a daughter who is
healthy,

1:21:40.980 --> 1:21:44.348
you have a job that you
love, you have friends.

1:21:44.442 --> 1:21:46.692
Oh, but that wasn't
enough for you, was it?

1:21:46.819 --> 1:21:49.904
It just wasn't enough for you!

1:21:50.823 --> 1:21:54.450
Poor little rich girl.

1:21:54.535 --> 1:21:56.994
Oh, poor baby.

1:21:57.079 --> 1:21:58.245
- You're crazy.

1:21:58.331 --> 1:22:01.415
- Oh, we don't like that term!

1:22:01.500 --> 1:22:03.292
It is stigmatizing.

1:22:03.377 --> 1:22:06.879
Oh, but I know you will never
say that again, will you?

1:22:07.006 --> 1:22:07.704
You know why?

1:22:07.798 --> 1:22:09.539
Because I'm gonna help you!

1:22:12.762 --> 1:22:13.710
Don't fight it!

1:22:13.804 --> 1:22:16.180
Come on, I'm gonna say goodbye
to you

1:22:16.265 --> 1:22:18.307
once and for all.

1:22:18.392 --> 1:22:20.225
Now it's gonna be easy, or is
it?

1:22:39.413 --> 1:22:40.412
- Mom?

1:22:40.539 --> 1:22:41.622
- Jess.

1:22:46.128 --> 1:22:47.086
Go.

1:22:47.213 --> 1:22:48.078
Go get an ambulance.

1:22:48.172 --> 1:22:49.672
Go, they're outside.

1:22:49.757 --> 1:22:51.382
Wake up, baby, come on.

1:22:51.467 --> 1:22:52.716
Wake up, come on, come on.

1:22:56.597 --> 1:22:57.179
Are you warm?

1:22:57.264 --> 1:22:59.348
- Yeah, thank you, Mom.

1:23:00.851 --> 1:23:01.684
- This is ridiculous, I'm fine.

1:23:01.769 --> 1:23:02.643
- Oh, honey, I just want to get
you

1:23:02.728 --> 1:23:04.261
checked out officially, okay?

1:23:04.355 --> 1:23:05.104
- Are you okay?

1:23:05.231 --> 1:23:06.930
Are you okay?

1:23:07.024 --> 1:23:08.190
- We're gonna go to the hospital

1:23:08.275 --> 1:23:09.525
and get your head checked.

1:23:09.610 --> 1:23:10.359
We're right behind you.

1:23:10.444 --> 1:23:11.601
- I love you.

1:23:11.696 --> 1:23:12.269
- I love you.
- I love you.

1:23:12.363 --> 1:23:13.070
- I love you, Daddy.

1:23:13.155 --> 1:23:14.822
- You got hit in the head.

1:23:32.425 --> 1:23:33.465
- Well, Mrs. Curtis.

1:23:34.260 --> 1:23:35.292
Based on what you've told us,

1:23:35.386 --> 1:23:37.052
I feel like I owe you
an apology for earlier.

1:23:37.138 --> 1:23:38.721
- No apology necessary.

1:23:39.598 --> 1:23:41.432
Just happy to have my life back.

1:23:43.477 --> 1:23:45.102
I wouldn't change it for the
world.

1:23:47.231 --> 1:23:49.023
- So, what about Marsha?

1:23:49.984 --> 1:23:51.141
Or whoever she is?

1:23:51.235 --> 1:23:52.609
- Well, I don't think we'll
be hearing from her again

1:23:52.695 --> 1:23:53.777
for a long time.

1:23:53.863 --> 1:23:55.812
- I'll call you tomorrow,
take a statement.

1:23:55.906 --> 1:23:56.822
You should be with your husband.

1:23:56.949 --> 1:23:57.531
- Thank you.

1:23:57.616 --> 1:23:58.657
Thank you, Detective.

1:23:58.784 --> 1:24:01.118
- All right, ma'am, take care of
yourself.

1:24:01.203 --> 1:24:02.619
- All right, let's get
you to the hospital.

1:24:02.705 --> 1:24:04.488
Let's go see Dad.

1:24:04.582 --> 1:24:05.581
- Yes, yeah.

1:24:43.454 --> 1:24:46.747
Mom, that ice cream was so good!

1:24:48.250 --> 1:24:50.584
You know, we should make
this a regular thing

1:24:50.669 --> 1:24:52.002
and go every Wednesday.

1:24:52.088 --> 1:24:55.205
- Oh, I don't know, Jess.

1:24:55.299 --> 1:24:56.381
- Why?

1:24:56.509 --> 1:24:57.591
Too busy with work?

1:24:58.761 --> 1:24:59.968
- No.

1:25:00.054 --> 1:25:03.639
I just don't think you're gonna
be around every Wednesday.

1:25:03.724 --> 1:25:05.215
- Why's that?

1:25:05.309 --> 1:25:06.558
- Well...

1:25:12.316 --> 1:25:14.316
- We're so proud of you!

1:25:16.237 --> 1:25:17.694
- Mom!

1:25:17.780 --> 1:25:18.862
- You did it.

1:25:20.491 --> 1:25:21.698
Here you come, Price.

1:25:23.994 --> 1:25:24.868
- Yes!

1:25:27.498 --> 1:25:30.707
- Yeah, things didn't really
work out all that great

1:25:30.793 --> 1:25:32.709
with my last therapist.

1:25:32.795 --> 1:25:35.912
Actually, things haven't been
that great

1:25:36.006 --> 1:25:37.714
in my life in general.

1:25:37.800 --> 1:25:41.176
And I'm just, you know,
looking for a fresh start.

1:25:41.262 --> 1:25:45.013
Some day I want to be a
therapist and help people.
