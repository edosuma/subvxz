Can we talk?

01:06.199 --> 01:07.766
For a fan? Any...

01:07.801 --> 01:09.334
Oh, great.

01:09.369 --> 01:11.670
A Batman-themed magician,
just what this town needed.

01:14.274 --> 01:16.908
I am Batman.

01:16.943 --> 01:19.111
I know. I get it.
You realize you'll be
competing with

01:19.146 --> 01:21.513
the Shazam-themed magician
at the Desert Empress, right?

01:22.215 --> 01:23.248
You're coming with me.

01:23.283 --> 01:24.749
To Apokolips.

01:24.784 --> 01:27.152
I'm sorry, sometimes
this mask impedes my hearing,

01:27.187 --> 01:28.720
but I guess you know that.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.489
You said Albuquerque?

01:30.524 --> 01:31.557
Apokolips.

01:32.325 --> 01:34.159
No! No, no no!

01:34.194 --> 01:35.560
You do not want
to go to Apokolips,

01:35.595 --> 01:36.628
believe me.

01:36.663 --> 01:39.297
It's my hometown planet
I left for a reason.

01:39.332 --> 01:40.866
I don't have time to argue.

01:40.901 --> 01:42.634
Good, me either.

01:42.669 --> 01:45.571
I have to be across town
to open for that hack Zatanna.
Ugh.

01:46.873 --> 01:49.307
You still use a boomerang?

01:49.342 --> 01:50.775
(SCOFFS) Rookie.

01:50.810 --> 01:52.777
Ta-da!

01:52.812 --> 01:55.981
I'm a master of escape.
You didn't think a little rope
was going to hold me, did you?

01:56.016 --> 01:57.282
You won't get away
that easily.

01:58.218 --> 01:59.751
(THUMPING)

01:59.786 --> 02:00.986
You grabbed my cape?

02:01.021 --> 02:03.488
There's a cape code!
What about the cape code?

02:03.523 --> 02:06.324
(GROANS) I sense a lot
of hostility here.

02:06.359 --> 02:07.726
Have you thought of yoga?

02:09.796 --> 02:11.830
Correction, you had me.

02:11.865 --> 02:14.600
Sorry to leave in a hurry,
but I have a show to start!

02:20.207 --> 02:21.406
(BEEPING)

02:28.315 --> 02:29.948
And five minutes to spare.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.783
Batman thinks he can catch me.

02:32.686 --> 02:33.752
(GRUNTS)

02:34.187 --> 02:35.587
(GROANS)

02:37.390 --> 02:38.723
Huh, would you look at that?

02:38.758 --> 02:42.494
Sorry, Bats.
No one can catch Mr. Miracle!

02:44.297 --> 02:46.832
WOMAN:
Oh, I don't know about that.

02:49.769 --> 02:51.002
MR. MIRACLE: Granny?

02:51.037 --> 02:53.038
You're looking...well.

02:53.073 --> 02:55.273
For an evil, elderly person.

02:55.308 --> 02:57.175
I told Darkseid I would
handle it.

02:57.210 --> 02:58.877
You have.

02:58.912 --> 03:01.246
We'll take it from here.

03:01.281 --> 03:02.481
I don't think so.

03:04.084 --> 03:05.284
(GRUNTS)

03:09.856 --> 03:11.924
Now that's what I call
an entrance!

(GROANS)

03:26.006 --> 03:27.239
(GRUNTS)

03:32.345 --> 03:33.778
And now for the escape.

03:33.813 --> 03:34.880
Follow me, Bats.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.319
You've been very, very bad.

03:41.354 --> 03:43.722
Granny's gonna need
to teach you both

03:43.757 --> 03:44.823
a lesson.

03:46.092 --> 03:47.158
MR. MIRACLE: Oh!

03:47.193 --> 03:49.227
Oh, the agony.

03:49.262 --> 03:51.997
Oh, oh! The pain!

04:22.662 --> 04:24.963

04:24.998 --> 04:26.498
Entertainment!

04:28.435 --> 04:30.636
(CHEERING)

04:31.871 --> 04:34.172
Wow, they loved me.

04:34.207 --> 04:36.375
Take that, Zatanna!

04:38.678 --> 04:42.147
You'll never
escape us, Scottie.

04:42.182 --> 04:44.616
I beg to differ!

04:44.651 --> 04:46.751
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

04:46.786 --> 04:49.488
Spread out.
He has to be nearby.

04:53.727 --> 04:54.826
(YELPS)

04:58.031 --> 04:59.998
How did you know?

05:00.033 --> 05:02.867
I don't have to be the world's
greatest detective to know
there was no way

05:02.902 --> 05:05.103
you were going to leave
a standing ovation.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.739
I know! They loved me!

05:07.774 --> 05:10.375
You should join me
on stage every night.

05:10.410 --> 05:13.011
Mr. Miracle
and his pal, Batman.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.046
80-20 split?

05:15.815 --> 05:17.549
Fine! 70-30.

05:17.584 --> 05:19.050
But just because I like you.

05:19.085 --> 05:21.586
Listen, enough games.
Darkseid has a hostage

05:21.621 --> 05:24.422
and she's finished unless
I bring you to him.

05:24.457 --> 05:26.525
It's not even me
they're after.

05:27.861 --> 05:28.960
What is it?

05:28.995 --> 05:30.895
The last part of the
Anti-Life Equation.

05:30.930 --> 05:33.865
The missing key to
Darkseid's Life-Void Machine.

05:33.900 --> 05:36.267
<i>It's a brutal weapon</i>
<i>of insurmountable power,</i>

05:36.302 --> 05:40.138
<i>capable of stretching across</i>
<i>galaxies and vaporizing</i>
<i>any and all sentient thought.</i>

05:40.173 --> 05:43.608
<i>Leaving only mindless</i>
<i>shells controlled by</i>
<i>Darkseid himself.</i>

05:43.643 --> 05:45.910
If Darkseid gets
his hands on this,

05:45.945 --> 05:49.414
the world as we
know it will just...

05:49.449 --> 05:51.349
Without it,
I can't save Barda.

05:51.384 --> 05:53.451
That's who Darkseid has.

05:53.486 --> 05:55.253
Barda? As in Big Barda?

05:55.288 --> 05:56.588
Yes, do you know her?

05:56.623 --> 05:58.690
Know her? She's my girlfriend!

06:02.095 --> 06:04.295
BATMAN: <i> Darkseid,</i>
<i>this is Batman.</i>

06:04.330 --> 06:05.831
I have Mr. Miracle.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.378
Barda!

06:24.751 --> 06:26.718
Oh, so it's gonna
be like that.

06:33.660 --> 06:36.494
My prodigal son returns.

06:36.529 --> 06:38.696
-Son?
-Adopted. Long story.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.699
Dad! It's great to see you!

06:41.901 --> 06:43.101
You look...good.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.470
Have you been working out?
Your chest feels...

06:46.272 --> 06:47.505
Stonier than usual.

06:47.540 --> 06:50.508
You could have ruled
by my side.

06:50.543 --> 06:54.579
But instead you chose to
run away.

06:54.614 --> 06:58.850
Well, maybe if someone spent
as much time with me as
he did with Kalibak,

06:58.885 --> 07:00.318
I would have stuck around.

07:00.353 --> 07:01.986
Enough prattling.

07:02.021 --> 07:05.390
Give me the piece of
the Anti-Life Equation
you stole.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.859
Once I place it
in the machine,

07:07.894 --> 07:13.498
the universe will bow
before the will
of Darkseid.

07:16.202 --> 07:17.436
You mean this?

07:17.971 --> 07:19.571
Or this?

07:19.606 --> 07:20.906
My mother box!

07:22.942 --> 07:24.142

07:29.949 --> 07:31.316

07:31.351 --> 07:33.952
You could have boom tubed
us out of here instead.

07:33.987 --> 07:36.588
Please, where's the
razzle-dazzle in that?

07:36.623 --> 07:39.124
Besides, we have to destroy
that machine!

saves the day again.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.746

09:11.684 --> 09:13.752
That's my boyfriend!

09:36.976 --> 09:38.810
Miracle, a boom tube!

09:38.845 --> 09:40.278
But the Anti-Life Equation!

09:40.313 --> 09:41.313
Now!

09:53.326 --> 09:54.626
Should we go after them?

09:54.661 --> 09:56.361
We have what we wanted.

09:58.564 --> 10:01.766
As soon as Batman told me
you were in trouble,
I came back.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.303
You've been gone a long time.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.505
Barda...

10:07.540 --> 10:10.075
You are the only trap
I could never escape from.

10:11.577 --> 10:13.211
Aw, Scott.

10:18.418 --> 10:21.353
I'm just sorry Darkseid
got the Anti-Life Equation.

10:22.088 --> 10:23.554
BATMAN: Did he?

10:23.589 --> 10:25.523
But, but how?

10:25.558 --> 10:29.293
You're not the only one
who knows a little
sleight of hand.

10:29.328 --> 10:31.963
We'll keep it under guard
at the Watchtower.

10:31.998 --> 10:33.931
But if you have
the Equation...

10:33.966 --> 10:35.367
What does Darkseid have?

10:37.336 --> 10:42.007
Finally, the last piece
of the Equation is mine.

10:53.252 --> 10:56.855
(YELLING) Scott!
