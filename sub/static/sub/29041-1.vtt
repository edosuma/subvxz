02:02.570 --> 02:04.710
What, what most people don't realize

02:07.096 --> 02:10.096
is that your intestines are
made up of a network of neurons.

02:11.147 --> 02:12.068
It's a lot like your brain.

02:12.070 --> 02:13.135
It's incredibly complex.

02:13.137 --> 02:16.128
It, it, it, it makes
all kinds of decisions

02:16.130 --> 02:17.898
about digesting your food

02:17.900 --> 02:21.138
so your main brain can
get on with other things,

02:21.140 --> 02:24.363
like a, a co-processor.

02:25.310 --> 02:26.823
It's a second brain.

02:27.970 --> 02:30.310
But I'd always suspected

02:31.392 --> 02:34.218
it's way more sophisticated than that.

02:34.220 --> 02:36.203
Like, like what if,

02:37.140 --> 02:40.733
what if your intestines
were actually conscious?

02:42.260 --> 02:43.091
You wouldn't know,

02:43.093 --> 02:44.878
as it'd be separate to your consciousness.

02:44.880 --> 02:48.928
But imagine being the conscious bowel.

02:48.930 --> 02:52.728
You have no eyes, no
ears, can't speak or move.

02:52.730 --> 02:55.998
The only thing you can
do to attract attention

02:56.000 --> 02:58.288
would be to inflict pain,

02:58.290 --> 03:00.838
you know, like abdominal cramps, gut ache.

03:00.840 --> 03:02.611
That's, that's what it is!

03:02.613 --> 03:05.098
It's the conscious bowel trapped

03:05.100 --> 03:06.298
in, in its, in its own,

03:06.300 --> 03:10.488
in its own self-aware
hell of digesting food.

03:10.490 --> 03:15.490
So knowing all this, I did
something kind of pioneering.

03:19.017 --> 03:21.668
I, I made contact. (LAUGHS)

03:21.670 --> 03:25.898
I, like I joined the two consciousnesses.

03:25.900 --> 03:28.108
It's, it's hard to put into words.

03:28.110 --> 03:29.318
Please try.

03:29.320 --> 03:30.478
The details are a bit hazy.

03:30.480 --> 03:32.798
I'm not sure of the exact steps.

03:32.800 --> 03:35.948
But, but once I was, once I was in there,

03:35.950 --> 03:37.568
I could walk around.

03:37.570 --> 03:40.018
I, (LAUGHS) I even saw
other people in there.

03:40.020 --> 03:44.083
Then I saw the girl from my
failed date the night before.

03:45.470 --> 03:47.098
I just spiralled into paranoia,

03:47.100 --> 03:48.468
thinking, thinking about how I,

03:48.470 --> 03:50.948
how I'd screwed up the, the date with her

03:50.950 --> 03:53.438
and, and now she was in my, my bowel.

03:53.440 --> 03:56.168
I mean, how, like how does that happen?

03:56.170 --> 03:57.648
Sweet Jesus.

03:57.650 --> 03:58.488
It gets worse.

03:58.490 --> 03:59.358
Oh it gets worse?

03:59.360 --> 04:01.148
Yeah, while I wasn't paying attention,

04:01.150 --> 04:03.428
I started digesting myself.

04:03.430 --> 04:06.538
Like my intestines were
getting their revenge.

04:06.540 --> 04:09.028
My bowels were out to get me.

04:09.030 --> 04:12.608
I'm telling you, you don't
wanna mess with this fucker!

04:12.610 --> 04:13.918
Don't you think if your bowels

04:13.920 --> 04:15.148
were really trying to kill you,

04:15.150 --> 04:19.230
they would just, I don't know,
stop digesting your food?

04:21.610 --> 04:22.443
I guess so.

04:24.215 --> 04:25.578
But one thing I still can't figure out

04:25.580 --> 04:28.798
is how I ended up in the
women's jail in a burned dress.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.148
Every good journey into your own bowels

04:31.150 --> 04:33.818
ends in a women's jail in a burned dress.

05:03.895 --> 05:06.002

much of an effect on me,

05:19.805 --> 05:20.638
to be honest.

05:21.485 --> 05:23.333
So it's back to the drawing board then.

05:23.335 --> 05:26.398
Well, nice name, nice logo.

05:27.543 --> 05:28.423
Sure as hell works.

05:28.425 --> 05:30.993
It's just too weird to
ever get any mass appeal.

05:30.995 --> 05:32.843
All right guys, listen up.

05:32.845 --> 05:34.293

equipment, new methods.

05:59.515 --> 06:02.923

of this stuff under the radar.

up with something so clean

and, and exquisite, with no scary shit.

06:27.845 --> 06:29.493
to be non-sentient from now on.

tell he was agitated?

07:15.055 --> 07:17.423
being content doesn't breed creativity.

07:17.425 --> 07:19.053

07:51.695 --> 07:53.533
on account of they were so hooked on it.

08:12.185 --> 08:13.983
they got theme nights for everything,

08:13.985 --> 08:16.990
from acid house to drum
and bass, house and trance.

08:16.992 --> 08:19.673

last night first, please?

we got late '80s acid house.

08:28.605 --> 08:30.453
DJ Burst Reynolds, always a winner.

08:30.455 --> 08:31.523

08:32.784 --> 08:37.107
huge illegal outdoor acid house
parties in the late 1980s?

08:39.020 --> 08:41.517

been around at that time.

Next up we have early
'90s, rave, the islands.

DJ Sean Coronary headlining.

I'm thinking loved up,
ecstasy style, you know,

everyone where they're from,

08:54.345 --> 08:57.053
gurning, chewing your own
face off, all the classics.

08:57.055 --> 08:58.403
Chewing.

08:58.405 --> 09:02.173
Then we got late '90s trance.

09:02.175 --> 09:03.063
I'm thinking there's gotta be

09:03.065 --> 09:05.603
an amphetamine or a
coke-type adrenaline rush.

09:05.605 --> 09:09.224
You know, that, that warm,
fuzzy, indestructible feeling.

09:09.226 --> 09:11.343
I'm getting nauseous
just thinking about it.

09:11.345 --> 09:15.743
Then finally there's an
ambient down-tempo night

09:15.745 --> 09:17.363
at the club in the tower.

09:17.365 --> 09:20.713

09:49.546 --> 09:53.026
but you know, events like
this don't happen every year.

who can get us cheap tickets,

09:54.735 --> 09:56.358

to take a serious vacation

12:40.075 --> 12:41.288
Adrian, my love.

12:43.075 --> 12:45.508
I was just dreaming about you.

12:46.475 --> 12:47.833
Hi, grandma.

12:47.835 --> 12:48.668
How you doing?

12:50.063 --> 12:51.113
I'm comfortable, dear.

12:52.965 --> 12:54.708
They're so nice to me here.

12:56.975 --> 12:58.988
This young gentleman in particular.

13:00.763 --> 13:02.365
If I was a few years younger

13:03.735 --> 13:05.415
and could actually move.

13:06.455 --> 13:09.248
You're enough of a handful
bedridden, Mrs. Carter.

13:11.915 --> 13:13.378
I uh, got you these.

13:14.515 --> 13:17.173
Oh honey, they're lovely.

13:17.175 --> 13:19.373
I stole them from Mrs.
Peterson's bedside table.

13:19.375 --> 13:21.375
She was in no condition to run after me.

13:27.995 --> 13:31.328
We've started her on a new
cycle of Butron FL 5 and 6.

13:32.735 --> 13:33.910
I've seen good results with this,

13:33.912 --> 13:36.643
but we'll just have to wait
and see how she responds.

13:36.645 --> 13:37.683
What about the pain?

13:37.685 --> 13:40.363
We're still giving her
high doses of Opiaxa,

13:40.365 --> 13:43.383
but I can't give her anymore
without risking kidney damage.

13:43.385 --> 13:45.185
She's very comfortable, don't worry.

13:46.605 --> 13:47.438
Adrian.

13:50.125 --> 13:50.958
Darling.

13:53.475 --> 13:55.318
Can you hand me the thing?

13:57.499 --> 13:58.330
The thing?

13:58.332 --> 13:59.648
Oh, the thing, yeah.

14:08.275 --> 14:10.336
- Thanks, sweetie.
- DR. LINDSAY: How about you?

14:10.338 --> 14:11.803
When are you being tested again?

14:11.805 --> 14:13.623
I'm being tested every two weeks.

14:13.625 --> 14:14.573
That's good.

14:14.575 --> 14:16.773
I can't emphasize how important it is.

14:16.775 --> 14:18.478
Considering the current situation,

14:19.435 --> 14:20.685
you wanna catch it early.

14:22.015 --> 14:22.979
Yeah, I understand.

14:22.981 --> 14:24.208
I'm on top of it.

14:30.695 --> 14:31.845
Hang in there, grandma.

14:33.550 --> 14:34.950
I can't do this without you.

14:46.985 --> 14:48.683
I've got the results, Mason.

14:48.685 --> 14:50.463
Awesome, Lucy, thanks.

14:50.465 --> 14:51.715
Uh, send them to me here.

14:55.255 --> 14:58.253
Oh, (LAUGHS) not so good, eh?

14:58.255 --> 15:01.083
No, all the virtual
rats died after 26 hours.

15:01.085 --> 15:02.683
90% had brain lesions

15:02.685 --> 15:05.193
and 25% had multiple hemorrhages.

15:05.195 --> 15:06.533
What about the real rats?

15:06.535 --> 15:08.013
We had trouble authorizing that,

15:08.015 --> 15:10.013
so the sample's pretty small.

15:10.015 --> 15:11.683
All of them died after 25 hours,

15:11.685 --> 15:13.803
and 24% had multiple hemorrhages,

15:13.805 --> 15:16.533
pulmonary edema, and renal damage.

15:16.535 --> 15:17.963
Did you try the virtual human?

15:17.965 --> 15:20.283
Well, you know how inaccurate the VH is,

15:20.285 --> 15:23.940
but cardiac arrest, liver
damage, kidney failure,

15:23.942 --> 15:26.643
and the head swelled up
three times the normal size

15:26.645 --> 15:28.003
all within an hour.

15:28.005 --> 15:31.073
Patient was dead 77 minutes
after administration.

15:31.075 --> 15:32.500
Jeez!

15:32.502 --> 15:34.593
I'm glad I'm not taking
this stuff on Friday.

15:34.595 --> 15:35.426
Sorry?

15:35.428 --> 15:36.533
Nothing.

15:36.535 --> 15:38.183
I'll make a few changes.

15:38.185 --> 15:40.393
Thanks Lucy, we're getting there.

Yes, sir.

Very good.

I see you're working on

16:26.385 --> 16:30.125
Compound, uh, 347B has
proven to be the most

16:31.085 --> 16:33.533
difficult so far.

16:33.535 --> 16:34.468
Really, Mason?

16:35.695 --> 16:37.483
I'm a little concerned
about some of the requests

16:37.485 --> 16:39.393
coming out of your department.

16:39.395 --> 16:43.928
Live rats, garmic
analyzers, nano-centrifuges,

16:44.915 --> 16:48.948
and seven liters of
neolysergic-acide trioxidine.

16:50.215 --> 16:53.048
I can't imagine what you
need some of these items for,

16:53.955 --> 16:55.032
especially NAT.

16:56.485 --> 16:57.523
I don't need to remind you

16:57.525 --> 16:59.725
that that stuff is still
tightly controlled.

17:01.525 --> 17:03.513
You're running the department now, Mason.

17:03.515 --> 17:05.948
So please, enlighten me.

17:07.233 --> 17:09.928
Uh, well, sir.

17:10.775 --> 17:14.522
The disease changes so rapidly
in some of the subjects

17:14.525 --> 17:17.363
that the phase one compounds
are already useless.

17:17.365 --> 17:21.358
We, we've had to think
outside the box in phase two.

17:22.205 --> 17:25.272
I'm not using the NAT unaltered.

17:25.275 --> 17:27.808
We're, uh, sieving it.

17:28.705 --> 17:31.733
And the rats were incinerated afterwards.

17:31.735 --> 17:32.785
We're always careful.

17:33.855 --> 17:35.823
Altered or unaltered,

17:35.825 --> 17:37.833
I don't want you injecting
our human subjects

17:37.835 --> 17:39.078
with that stuff, okay?

17:40.195 --> 17:43.343
No sir, I wouldn't, uh, dream of it.

you know how much heat we take

guys kills something?

in your department, Mason,

17:56.695 --> 17:59.413

18:24.124 --> 18:26.403
I've been ordering for the department.

legit for disease research,

18:33.425 --> 18:35.033

rational decisions,

32:07.625 --> 32:09.000
and block their ears.

Otherwise he'd be compelled
by the song of the Siren

01:54:50.420 --> 01:54:52.298
They really know how to throw a party.

01:54:52.300 --> 01:54:54.118
Any excuse, you know.

01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:56.623
I'd hardly call what
you've done an excuse.

01:54:57.573 --> 01:54:59.478
It's the best reason to celebrate.

01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:01.658
My god, does everybody know?

01:55:01.660 --> 01:55:03.063
Word travels fast.

01:55:05.175 --> 01:55:06.008
I guess.

01:55:06.897 --> 01:55:08.233
You wanna get some air?

01:55:09.220 --> 01:55:10.513
Sure, why not?

01:55:16.762 --> 01:55:18.218
Well you've got my attention.

01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:19.183
I knew I would.

01:55:25.147 --> 01:55:26.925
(ADRIAN GRUNTS)

01:55:26.927 --> 01:55:28.258
Are you okay?

01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:29.093
Yeah.

01:55:30.708 --> 01:55:33.158
I must've eaten something
that's disagreeing with me,

01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:33.993
that's all.

01:55:41.220 --> 01:55:42.598
You're gonna have to excuse me.

01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:44.338
Just hold that thought.

01:55:44.340 --> 01:55:45.173
Go.

01:55:53.700 --> 01:55:56.033
(SPLASHING)

01:56:02.168 --> 01:56:04.501
(VIBRATING)

01:56:09.028 --> 01:56:11.465
(SPLASHING)

01:56:11.467 --> 01:56:15.300
("MY BODY" BY OBVIOUSLY HIGH)

01:56:17.410 --> 01:56:18.508
Feeling better?

01:56:18.510 --> 01:56:19.968
Yeah.

01:56:19.970 --> 01:56:20.803
Weird though.

01:56:21.700 --> 01:56:24.678
There's something growing
on their bathroom cabinet.

01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:25.598
It's strange.

01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:27.873
They're usually very clean people.

01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:30.960
I'm sure it's nothing.

01:56:31.910 --> 01:56:33.153
Come on, let's dance.

01:56:35.356 --> 01:56:38.023
(ADRIAN GRUNTS)

01:56:45.596 --> 01:56:47.758
You can't go in there, buddy.

01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:52.117
You breathe in those spores,
you'll turn into a woman.

01:56:57.600 --> 01:56:59.008
(MUFFLED HOWLING)
