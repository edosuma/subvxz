Fisher, it's me!
Fisher, pick up!

01:50.474 --> 01:53.685
I'm late, come on, come on.
I need to bounce some ideas off you.

01:53.768 --> 01:55.728
Mine are all boring,
done it, been there.

01:55.812 --> 01:56.854
Hey, Ike!

01:56.938 --> 02:00.107
When are you guys gonna stop
waking me up every morning?

02:00.190 --> 02:02.567
When your column stops
putting me to sleep.

02:02.651 --> 02:05.278
- Funny, funny.
- Yo, Jonah!

02:05.361 --> 02:07.405
Fisher, come on!
Are you really not there?

02:07.488 --> 02:09.615
All right, cool.
I'll talk to you later.

02:09.698 --> 02:12.659
Excuse me. I'm thinking of doing
an article about limousines.

02:12.742 --> 02:15.787
What do you think about people
who've never been in one?

02:15.828 --> 02:17.663
I don't know people like that.

02:17.747 --> 02:21.625
I need someone to bounce some ideas
off of and get the juices flowing.

02:21.667 --> 02:24.753
I got one hour,
27 minutes, 52 seconds.

02:24.836 --> 02:26.796
Hey, Ike! When are you gonna
put me in a column?

02:26.879 --> 02:29.757
- When your T-shirts stop shrinking.
- [Woman] Shrinks?

02:29.840 --> 02:32.718
-Funny. He's kidding. He's just kidding.
-Oh, forget it.

02:32.801 --> 02:36.012
- Here, give me $5. Give me $2.
- [Woman] No way.

02:36.095 --> 02:39.015
Folks, I got nice shirts here.
Look!

02:39.098 --> 02:41.308
"I love everybody. You're next."

%[Female Singing]

02:56.029 --> 02:59.240
So what's in store for us
in tomorrow's column?

02:59.323 --> 03:02.034
[Groans]
I don't know yet.

03:03.076 --> 03:07.038
I'm, uh, kind of
a last-minute man.

03:07.080 --> 03:10.333
You know, till an hour or two
before deadline, I don't get any ideas.

03:12.001 --> 03:14.586
So you get your ideas
for your column from life.

03:14.669 --> 03:16.588
Start up a conversation with a woman
in a bar.

03:16.671 --> 03:19.340
Attack her dart playing
and try to get a rise out of her...

03:19.423 --> 03:23.010
while you contemplate whether
or not she's worth hitting on.

03:23.093 --> 03:25.804
No, I can't hit on you
till I get an idea.

03:25.887 --> 03:27.639
Wh-- That's flattering.

03:27.722 --> 03:30.057
[Ike]
No, you don't understand.

03:30.099 --> 03:33.602
I understand. See,
my not responding to you baiting me...

03:33.685 --> 03:37.397
will inspire one of those bitter
diatribes you like to write about women.

03:37.480 --> 03:39.774
[Ike]I don't write bitter diatribes
about women.

03:39.857 --> 03:42.651
- Oh-ho.
- Very often. I could.

03:42.735 --> 03:45.570
Only when the ideas
aren't flowing, huh?

03:45.612 --> 03:47.697
It's so nice to meet you,
one-minute man.

03:47.781 --> 03:50.741
It's last-minute man.

03:50.825 --> 03:52.993
Whatever.

03:53.077 --> 03:56.288
Want to hear something funny? For a
good-looking guy, you strike out a lot.

03:56.371 --> 03:59.415
- [Bartender] Have you noticed that?
- [Phone Ringing]

03:59.499 --> 04:01.834
- I bet it's your ex-wife.
- [Man] Excuse me.

04:01.917 --> 04:03.794
I've seen much worse.

04:03.877 --> 04:06.588
[Bartender]
No, Ike's not here.

04:06.671 --> 04:09.716
I say, I've seen much worse.

04:09.799 --> 04:12.301
- I'll tell him when he comes in.
- Excuse me?

04:12.385 --> 04:15.262
The brush-off.

04:15.304 --> 04:18.055
I've witnessed far more...

04:18.098 --> 04:21.184
treacherous and nefarious exits
than that.

04:22.310 --> 04:24.770
At least she castigated you
in private.

04:24.853 --> 04:28.356
Not as private as I thought.
Kevin, you got some napkins there?

04:28.440 --> 04:32.276
- Wiping or writing?
- I'll let you know.

04:32.318 --> 04:35.279
They love you.
They hate you.

04:35.321 --> 04:37.864
They're hot.
They're cold. They're high.

04:37.948 --> 04:39.908
They're up. They're down.

04:39.949 --> 04:43.577
This is fun making a list with you,
but I do have a column to write.

04:43.661 --> 04:45.454
Ike.

04:45.537 --> 04:49.541
But you have yet to find
a really superb idea.

04:49.624 --> 04:53.002
There's a girl from my hometown
that you could write about.

04:53.085 --> 04:55.004
Excuse me,
but we don't need any ideas.

04:55.087 --> 04:58.632
She likes to dump grooms at the altar.
They call her the "Runaway Bride."

04:58.715 --> 05:01.718
She's performed the travesty
seven or eight times.

05:01.801 --> 05:05.429
Turns around, runs like hell.
Bolts. Adios.

05:05.471 --> 05:08.140
Plows down the aisle,
knocking old ladies out of her way...

05:08.223 --> 05:11.017
Like the Running of the Bulls
in Pamplona.

05:11.101 --> 05:13.561
And guess what!
She's got the next victim all lined up.

05:13.644 --> 05:16.772
She's turning another body
on the spit.

05:16.855 --> 05:19.983
[Ike]
Okay, Italics, here we go.

05:22.402 --> 05:26.655
[Ike's Voice] Today is
a day of profound introspection.

05:26.739 --> 05:29.574
I have been accused
of using this column...

05:29.658 --> 05:33.786
to direct bitter diatribes
at the opposite sex.

05:33.870 --> 05:36.956
This uncomfortable accusation...

05:36.997 --> 05:41.209
has plunged me into at least 15 minutes
of serious reflection,

05:41.293 --> 05:43.378
from which I have emerged...

05:43.461 --> 05:48.757
with the conclusion that, yes,
I traffic in female stereotypes.

05:50.801 --> 05:54.303
"But how can one blame me when
every time I step out my front door,

05:54.345 --> 05:58.515
I meet fresh proof that the female
archetypes are alive and well."

05:58.599 --> 06:02.102
"The mother, the virgin,
the whore, the crone."

06:02.185 --> 06:05.063
"They're elbowing you in the subway,
stealing your cabs,

06:05.146 --> 06:07.815
and overwhelming you
with perfume in elevators."

06:07.898 --> 06:09.858
"But perhaps in fairness
to the fairer sex,

06:09.942 --> 06:14.112
I do need to broaden my horizon and add
some new goddesses to the pantheon."

06:14.195 --> 06:18.157
"I would like to nominate
for deity the cheerleader, the coed...

06:18.240 --> 06:21.243
and the man-eater, the last
of which concerns me most today."

06:21.326 --> 06:24.704
"In ancient Greece, this fearsome female
was known as Erinys,

06:24.746 --> 06:26.747
the devouring death goddess."

06:26.831 --> 06:28.499
"In India, she is Kali,

06:28.541 --> 06:31.043
who likes to devour
her boyfriend Shiva's entrails..."

06:31.126 --> 06:33.837
"while her yoni devours
his dot, dot, dot... never mind."

06:33.920 --> 06:38.966
"In Indonesia, the bloody-jawed man-eater
is called Ragma."

06:39.049 --> 06:42.427
You notice these are
all countries without cable.

06:42.511 --> 06:44.888
"And in Hale, Maryland,

06:44.929 --> 06:47.098
where she helps run
the family hardware store,

06:47.181 --> 06:51.852
she is known as Miss Maggie Carpenter,
a.k.a. the Runaway Bride."

06:51.935 --> 06:54.771
"What is unusual about
Miss Carpenter...

06:54.854 --> 06:59.316
is that she likes to dress her men up
as grooms before she devours them."

06:59.400 --> 07:04.237
One antique hot-water handle
with the "hot" still on it.

07:04.321 --> 07:07.073
Guaranteed to fit
any American Standard cast-iron tub...

07:07.156 --> 07:11.743
with a four-inch center mount
made between 1924 and 1938.

07:11.827 --> 07:13.870
In other words,
Mr. Paxton,

07:13.954 --> 07:15.997
I think you are out of the doghouse
with Mrs. Paxton.

07:16.080 --> 07:17.040
Hallelujah!

07:17.123 --> 07:18.833
I'll see you later.
I'll put it on your charge.

07:18.916 --> 07:23.253
There's a possibility
she hasn't seen this yet.

07:23.337 --> 07:27.257
Maybe she just hasn't picked up a paper.
Know what I mean?

07:27.298 --> 07:30.134
- Or not.
- [Man]Maggie?

07:30.217 --> 07:32.886
Earl, you don't need an air-conditioner.
You need an attic fan.

07:32.970 --> 07:36.014
There's more in the back. Hey.

07:39.183 --> 07:41.101
What?

07:41.185 --> 07:44.271
So, Mag,
you've seen this, huh?

07:44.354 --> 07:46.272
Yes, I've seen it.

07:47.190 --> 07:49.108
And it is the rudest,

07:49.192 --> 07:51.694
most offensive...

07:51.777 --> 07:55.072

has ever played on me!

07:55.113 --> 07:58.032
You guys, how long did this take you?
Where did you get it done?

07:58.116 --> 08:00.326
You're both creeps, by the way.
I should "disinvite" you.

08:00.409 --> 08:05.664
Maggie, you told us
no bachelorette jokes, so we didn't--

08:11.293 --> 08:14.755
Holy moly.

08:16.464 --> 08:19.550
- Bag. Bag!
- She's going. She's gonna go!

[Radio] On the local front,
our town of Hale, Maryland,

08:47.199 --> 08:49.659
is still buzzing about
the less-than-flattering article...

08:49.742 --> 08:52.370
about their native daughter,
Maggie Carpenter.

08:52.453 --> 08:54.538
Her bridal exploits were taken
to task...

08:54.622 --> 08:57.207
by New York columnist
Ike Graham in USA Today.

08:57.290 --> 08:59.376
- Mr. Graham called her--
- [Radio Off]

08:59.459 --> 09:02.920
[Maggie's Voice]
Dear Editor: Greetings from the sticks.

09:03.004 --> 09:06.965
Perhaps you believe that
a rural education is focused mainly...

09:07.007 --> 09:11.260
on hog calling and tractor maintenance
rather than reading.

09:11.344 --> 09:13.304
Why else would you print a piece
of fiction about me and call it fact?

09:13.304 --> 09:15.180
Why else would you print a piece
of fiction about me and call it fact?

09:18.350 --> 09:21.227
I suppose Mr. Graham was too busy
thinking up slanderous statements...

09:21.311 --> 09:23.312
about how I dump men for kicks...

09:23.354 --> 09:26.190
to bother with something silly
like accuracy in reporting.

09:26.273 --> 09:29.192
Which is understandable, because
with a man-eater like me on the loose,

09:29.276 --> 09:31.194
who has time to check facts?

09:31.277 --> 09:34.113
- Hey, Frances, lunch today?
- No, I'm going to the bank.

09:34.196 --> 09:36.115
- Sure?
- Sorry, Ike.

09:36.198 --> 09:39.409
- All right. Hey.
- Hey.

09:39.493 --> 09:41.619
I'm going to put in
a good word for you.

09:41.703 --> 09:42.829
Don't mention my name.

09:42.870 --> 09:44.872
[Maggie's Voice]
That's why I was surprised to find...

09:44.914 --> 09:47.207
Mr. Graham's editor was a woman.

09:47.291 --> 09:50.543
Call me a sentimental fool, but I hoped
we man-eaters could stick together.

09:50.585 --> 09:53.087
"Anyway, I'm just dropping
you big-city folk this little note...

09:53.171 --> 09:55.673
to say that I have thought
of a ritual sacrifice..."

09:55.714 --> 09:57.758
"that would satisfy
my current appetite:

09:57.841 --> 10:00.177
"Ike Graham's column
on a platter."

10:00.218 --> 10:02.512
"Yours truly, Maggie Carpenter.

-What's Fisher doing here?
-Ellie asked me to offer moral support.

10:30.702 --> 10:33.705
Since when does Ellie
need moral support?

10:33.746 --> 10:36.165
It's for you, Ike.

10:38.751 --> 10:40.711
What? What?

10:40.752 --> 10:42.879
Journalism lesson number one:

10:42.921 --> 10:46.048
If you fabricate your facts,
you get fired.

10:46.090 --> 10:49.551
Lesson number two:
Never work for your former spouse.

10:49.593 --> 10:54.222
That has nothing to do with it. You
cooked this story up, and you know it!

10:54.305 --> 10:56.307
I did not cook anything up.
I had a source.

10:56.390 --> 10:58.642
Someone reliable?
Some boozehound in a bar?

10:58.726 --> 11:00.144
In vino veritas.

11:00.227 --> 11:04.731
Hey, hey, hey. Don't knock drunk guys
in bars. It means they're not driving.

11:04.772 --> 11:06.732

This is what columnists
are supposed to do.

It's what you like. We push,
we stretch, we go out on a limb.

11:13.655 --> 11:15.198
That's what makes me good!

11:15.281 --> 11:18.617
No, that's what
makes you unemployed.

11:21.328 --> 11:24.414
All right. Let's consider
that my wrist has been slapped.

11:24.456 --> 11:27.458
There. Slap it.
Go ahead, just--

11:27.542 --> 11:30.127
Slap my wrist.
That's done.

11:30.210 --> 11:35.673
Just give me a call when you feel
that I've served my time, and move on.

11:38.426 --> 11:41.136
This is permanent, Ike.

11:42.721 --> 11:45.974

I'll get you severance pay.

- You let me know if it's too heavy.
- Okay. Whoa!

12:58.410 --> 13:02.371
A little... yeah. Yeah,
a little heavy, baby. [Laughing]

13:02.413 --> 13:04.706
[Screams, Laughs]

13:10.003 --> 13:13.130
[Phone Rings, Message Machine] Hi,
it's me. Leave a message after the beep.

13:13.214 --> 13:15.883
If you want to leave a fax,
buy me a fax machine.

13:15.924 --> 13:18.343
[Beeps]
Ike, Fisher.

13:18.385 --> 13:23.097
Get up. I can turn
this Runaway Bride story around.

13:23.180 --> 13:26.516
I'm doing a photo spread for G.Q.
today by the convey or belt.

13:26.558 --> 13:28.977
Meet me. I'll save your tush.

13:29.060 --> 13:32.438
And since I do freelance stuff
for G.Q. now, I have an idea.

13:32.521 --> 13:35.065
- What are you saying?
- Vindication.

13:35.149 --> 13:37.192
How would you like some?

13:37.234 --> 13:40.695
A chance to prove that although
your story wasn't entirely factual,

13:40.778 --> 13:43.364
your theory was correct.

13:43.447 --> 13:47.534
- The real story on Miss Carpenter.
- All the gory details.

13:47.617 --> 13:49.577
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

13:49.619 --> 13:52.830
[Fisher] And if she runs again,
you got a cover story.

14:58.010 --> 14:59.970
Thanks. How late's
the restaurant open?

15:00.012 --> 15:03.431
- 8:30 every night.
- [Chuckles] That late, huh?

15:12.439 --> 15:15.316
[Maggie]
Cindy, can you eighty-six Sprout?

15:15.358 --> 15:18.652
He's licking up all the petroleum
distillates I'm trying to put in.

15:18.736 --> 15:21.196
Oh, sorry.
She's an obedience school dropout.

15:21.279 --> 15:25.116
- [Sprout Barks]
- Have a seat.

15:30.245 --> 15:32.289
[Applause]

15:32.372 --> 15:36.834
Thank you. We'll see you, ladies and
gentlemen, in the hotel on the weekend.

15:46.884 --> 15:49.261
You're a goddess.
You're a goddess!

15:49.345 --> 15:53.390
[Into Tape Recorder]
Shazam! I think I'm in Mayberry.

15:53.473 --> 15:56.684
[Maggie]I didn't have to change a
gasket, just put in new hydraulic fluid.

15:56.768 --> 15:59.311
[Woman] Stop it! When you talk like
that, it turns me on and frightens me.

15:59.395 --> 16:03.982
- Oh, you turn a girl's head.
- [Laughing] Whoa!

16:04.065 --> 16:07.402
Excuse me. Hello?

16:07.485 --> 16:09.695
Excuse me. Could you help--
I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.

16:09.737 --> 16:14.241
There was a, uh, note on the door
of the hardware store across the street.

16:14.324 --> 16:16.367
- Are you a reporter?
- What?

16:16.451 --> 16:18.452
It's just been
our experience that...

16:18.536 --> 16:21.372
anyone who comes in here
with tassels on his loafers...

16:21.413 --> 16:26.084
is a big-city reporter
wanting to do an interview with Maggie.

16:26.167 --> 16:28.169
About her upcoming
wedding and all.

16:28.211 --> 16:33.340
Actually about her getting
that asshole from New York fired.

16:33.382 --> 16:38.261
I am just such a reporter.
And who are you?

16:38.344 --> 16:42.765
- Peggy Flemming. Not the ice skater.
- [Laughs]

16:42.848 --> 16:44.850
[Peggy]
Come in, come in.

16:44.933 --> 16:47.185
[Ike]
Who are these lovely ladies?

16:47.227 --> 16:50.229
Hi. I'm Cindy.
Maggie's unmarried cousin.

16:50.313 --> 16:53.023
Mrs. Pressman.
No relation. Oh, sorry.

16:53.065 --> 16:55.067
[Peggy]
And you are?

16:55.108 --> 16:58.403
Looking... for Maggie.

16:58.444 --> 17:01.113
Maggie, someone to see you.

17:09.244 --> 17:14.708
I hope you've got a new angle because
it's all pretty much been covered.

17:14.790 --> 17:16.835
Hold on. No one interviews Maggie
in here without a haircut.

17:16.917 --> 17:19.337
Sorry, no.
Just got one.

17:19.420 --> 17:22.673
[Mrs. Pressman]
Excuse me, sir, I have a fact for you.

17:22.714 --> 17:26.510
- This is an actual fact.
- Yes, Mrs. Pressman?

17:26.593 --> 17:29.429
This is actually her fourth wedding,
not her seventh like they said.

17:29.512 --> 17:32.556
[Ike] I know. Tell me something.
Do you think she's...

17:32.640 --> 17:35.642
- gonna make it all the way this time?
- I don't know.

17:35.684 --> 17:38.561
[Gasps]

17:38.645 --> 17:42.440
She swallowed her gum.
She does that.

17:44.024 --> 17:47.360
Mr. Schulian, he runs the newsstand.
He's also our local bookie.

17:47.402 --> 17:49.362
He's given eight-to-one odds
that she won't.

17:49.446 --> 17:51.697
Okay.

17:51.739 --> 17:54.617
Instead of a haircut,
how 'bout a wash?

17:54.700 --> 17:56.785
Get all that city grit
out of your hair.

17:56.868 --> 17:58.787
You'll answer my questions?

17:58.870 --> 18:00.788
Mm-hmm.

18:00.872 --> 18:04.333
Fine! You wash, I'll ask.

18:04.416 --> 18:07.044
So, what do you want to know?

18:07.127 --> 18:09.045
When is the big day?

18:09.129 --> 18:13.132
- A week from Sunday.
- Let's put this here like this...

18:13.215 --> 18:16.218
because this aroma therapy
can get a little strong.

18:16.301 --> 18:18.553
The lavender,
we don't want to put you to sleep.

18:18.595 --> 18:20.096
[Ike] You nervous?

18:20.180 --> 18:22.807
I've never been more certain
of anything in my life.

18:22.890 --> 18:26.602
Except I've been having
all kinds of weird dreams.

18:26.685 --> 18:29.437
Mm-hmm. Would you like
to tell me about 'em?

18:29.521 --> 18:31.439
Yeah, sure.

18:31.522 --> 18:35.151
- [Maggie] And another one.
- Pete, I'll be right with ya.

18:35.234 --> 18:38.362
[Maggie] I go inside the church
and everyone I know is there.

18:38.445 --> 18:42.907
The creepiest part is
I look down at my dress, and it's red!

18:42.990 --> 18:46.160
I don't know what that means.
Red is not my color.

18:48.120 --> 18:50.080
What do you think?

18:50.121 --> 18:52.624
- I think you'd look good in red.
- No, no.

18:54.417 --> 18:58.045
She means about your hair.

18:59.838 --> 19:01.840
[Peggy Chuckles]

19:06.218 --> 19:09.221
My jacket, please.

19:09.304 --> 19:11.890
Thank you.

19:11.931 --> 19:17.311
Excuse me, sir. Do you know where I can
get some shampoo? Strong shampoo?

19:17.394 --> 19:21.147
Doc's pharmacy. Third and Elm.
Tell 'em Pete sent ya.

19:21.231 --> 19:23.191
You want my hat?

19:23.274 --> 19:27.111
No, no, I'm fine.
You might need it.

19:34.784 --> 19:39.163
Mr. Graham, if you're looking
for Elm Street, it's that way.

19:39.246 --> 19:41.414
Thank you.

19:41.498 --> 19:44.459
If you came down here in the pursuit of
happiness, you might as well go back...

19:44.500 --> 19:46.586
because you can't make me feel bad.

19:46.627 --> 19:50.839
I'm not trying to make you feel bad.
I'm here for vindication.

19:50.922 --> 19:54.008
In my heart,
I feel I'm right about you.

19:54.092 --> 19:55.676
Mmm.

19:55.760 --> 19:57.803
You got me fired, lady.

19:57.887 --> 20:02.641
You destroyed my reputation,
and you screwed up my hair.

20:02.682 --> 20:05.643
You chew up men,
spit 'em out and love it.

20:05.727 --> 20:08.896
You're gonna do the same thing
to this poor schmuck number four...

20:08.979 --> 20:11.440
that you did
to the previous three.

20:11.481 --> 20:13.441
You're gonna run again.

20:13.483 --> 20:15.735
And I'm not leaving until you do.

20:17.153 --> 20:21.532
I'd love to stay and chat,
but I still have my job.

20:28.371 --> 20:30.914
Hey, kid, kid, kid,
wait a minute.

20:30.998 --> 20:32.958
- Give you ten bucks for the hat.
- Sure!

20:32.999 --> 20:35.627
That's right.

20:39.505 --> 20:41.507
Sheesh.

20:49.013 --> 20:51.015
[Bob Chuckles]

20:51.056 --> 20:54.226
I'm telling you,
that is a photo opportunity.

20:54.309 --> 20:57.937
When I only see one dog,
I know I've had too much to drink.

20:59.647 --> 21:01.774
Hey, you'll never guess...

21:01.857 --> 21:06.236
who came crawling into town
with his tail between his legs.

21:06.319 --> 21:08.237
[Walter]
Who?

21:08.321 --> 21:10.406
Hello, Maggie.

21:10.489 --> 21:14.034
[Ike] I just came over
to apologize to your family.

21:14.117 --> 21:16.369
When I'm wrong, I'm wrong.

21:16.453 --> 21:19.205
I pushed a story.
I made a mistake.

21:19.288 --> 21:24.543
In other words, he's only human.
And he brought us a bottle of wine.

21:24.626 --> 21:28.421
-Made me put my hat back on.
-Yeah. It scared the hell outta Skipper.

21:28.504 --> 21:30.172
[Barks]

21:30.256 --> 21:32.466
You've gotta be kidding me.

21:32.549 --> 21:34.885
No, no. You should've seen Skipper.
He was like-- [Barks]

21:36.595 --> 21:39.180
[Howls]

21:41.140 --> 21:43.308
It wasn't that... funny.

21:43.392 --> 21:46.228
Actually, it's been quite amusing.

21:46.269 --> 21:50.106
Walter, here, has been sharing his
father of the bride wedding memories.

21:50.189 --> 21:52.775
You know what?

21:52.858 --> 21:56.778
I think I'll take this to the kitchen.
[Mouthing Words]

21:56.862 --> 22:00.698
I'll help you bring it in...
to the kitchen.

22:00.740 --> 22:02.992
- Check on the crabs, Bob.
- Okay.

22:03.075 --> 22:05.410
-[Whispers] Is he staying for dinner?
-I don't know.

22:05.452 --> 22:09.122
I hope they don't have a fight. You
don't think they'd call it off, do you?

22:09.205 --> 22:13.584
Wedding cake freezes. This we know.
[Chuckles]

22:13.626 --> 22:18.129
- You know, your daughter is such--
- [Gasps] Oh, I'm sorry.

22:18.213 --> 22:20.798
No, no, that's all right,
Grandma. That's fine.

22:20.882 --> 22:22.842
She's such a lovely girl.

22:22.925 --> 22:25.761
Yeah. Well,
like her mother. Look.

22:25.844 --> 22:28.138
May she rest in peace.

22:28.221 --> 22:31.099
We were all so proud of Maggie
when she was in school.

22:31.140 --> 22:34.643
She won that American Legion
scholarship to college.

22:34.727 --> 22:36.478
She studied industrial design.

22:36.562 --> 22:40.315
I can't see her leaving multiple grooms
in the dust like that.

22:40.398 --> 22:43.317
Oh, yes, you can.
She's got it all on tape.

22:44.610 --> 22:48.447
- Tape?
- Yeah, they're all right there.

22:48.488 --> 22:50.782
You got tapes of the wedding?

22:50.824 --> 22:52.909
Lee, at the hotel,
videos weddings.

22:52.992 --> 22:58.205
Course Maggie didn't know she was
gonna be running the 100-yarddash.

22:58.288 --> 23:01.958
- I gotta say, she makes real good time.
- Bingo!

23:02.041 --> 23:04.668
Maggie may not be
Hale's longest running joke,

23:04.752 --> 23:06.670
but she is certainly the fastest.

23:06.754 --> 23:09.506
Ha, ha.

23:12.175 --> 23:15.469
Maggie's mom and I
were only blessed with one child,

23:15.511 --> 23:17.513
not for a lack of trying.

23:17.596 --> 23:19.598
This is good, Dad.
Don't leave anything out.

23:20.682 --> 23:22.684
I consider it a bonus...

23:22.767 --> 23:25.436
[Skipper Barks]

23:25.478 --> 23:29.106
that I'm actually able to plan
and pay for so many weddings.

23:29.189 --> 23:31.524
Not this one.
This one's on me.

23:31.608 --> 23:34.235
Oh! That's fair.

23:34.318 --> 23:38.489
I don't do it on purpose, and
I have no intentions of doing it again.

23:38.572 --> 23:41.408
That's right, Maggie.
Just keep your eye on the ball.

23:43.660 --> 23:45.911
Sports psychology.

23:45.995 --> 23:51.499
Bob is the head of
the P.E. department at the high school.

23:51.583 --> 23:55.253
And he coaches the football team.
And he's climbed Everest.

23:57.338 --> 24:00.090
- Everest? Is it true?
- [Maggie] Twice.

24:00.173 --> 24:01.925
Without oxygen.

24:02.008 --> 24:05.136
- My girl, she likes to brag about me.
- I do.

24:06.262 --> 24:09.306
Maggie's training
for our wedding night.

24:09.389 --> 24:11.975
I'm taking her trekking on Annapurna
for our honeymoon.

24:12.058 --> 24:15.269
- Oh, how romantic!
- We think so.

24:15.353 --> 24:19.773
Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed
with two Sherpas and a yak.

24:19.857 --> 24:22.108
[Laughing]

24:24.569 --> 24:27.571
Hey, Ike, how's it going?

24:27.655 --> 24:31.366
You won't believe what
I'm looking at here. I got a video...

24:31.450 --> 24:33.368
of all three train wrecks.

24:33.451 --> 24:37.747
[Chavez]
Here's my bride, who's my pride.

24:37.830 --> 24:40.290
I'll never hide
when she's by my side.

24:40.374 --> 24:42.876
This is for you, Maggie,
my "Sugar Magnolia."

24:42.959 --> 24:48.381
[Ike] You want the truth?
You want the facts? I got 'em.

24:52.884 --> 24:55.053
I'll send you a copy
of the notes.

24:55.136 --> 24:57.263
Good weekend reading for you.

24:57.346 --> 24:59.223
Love to Ellie. Okay, bye.

Could we hold the horse, please?
What's wrong with the horse?

27:24.553 --> 27:28.140
The horse seems more jittery
than the bride.

27:55.079 --> 27:56.747
I like the white tuxedo.

27:56.789 --> 27:59.082
Yeah, but he's no good
'cause he's too blond.

All right. Then we just go
with something very traditional.

28:02.377 --> 28:06.422
He's handsome.
Maybe a little too dark for Bob.

Yeah, but he's got

of ridiculous questions.

one ridiculous question.

we dated before you were a priest?

it's, it's really, really how I feel.

- I'll play it for you.

about this, though,

You're saying viciousness is attractive?

39:30.621 --> 39:32.539
I didn't really
know him back then.

at the time.

They were never gonna...

39:42.089 --> 39:44.925

flirtatious energy,

42:36.569 --> 42:40.405

on anything male that moves.

As opposed to anything male
that doesn't?

"Hey, man, check me out."

No, I don't.

"I'm charming and mysterious
in a way that even I don't understand,

43:09.430 --> 43:15.143
and something about me is crying out
for protection from a big man like you."

You are totally mysterious.

- No, you're quirky.

Quirky and weird
are two very different things.

Peggy, I think there
is a distinct possibility...

43:45.961 --> 43:50.381
that I am profoundly
and irreversibly screwed up.

Despite that,

43:54.134 --> 43:57.512
I love you and I promise...

43:57.595 --> 43:59.931
to no longer flirt with Cory.

about you and Cory,

44:04.810 --> 44:07.312
or me and Cory,

44:07.395 --> 44:11.190

irreversibly screwed up.

Maggie, you've been like this
since we were kids.

And all I'm thinking is,
now that you're aware of it,

44:19.155 --> 44:21.449
and that it hurts
people's feelings sometimes,

44:21.490 --> 44:26.411
maybe it's time to get on with life,
and commit to someone of your own,

since you dragged
that little boy up the aisle.

54:03.813 --> 54:05.731
Drag-- No.
I didn't, I didn't--

54:05.814 --> 54:08.108
He tripped
on his own shoelaces.

54:08.191 --> 54:11.361
You've come for your dress. Good.
It's in the back. I'll get it.

54:11.444 --> 54:16.156
Actually, Mrs. Whittenmeyer,
I decided...

54:16.240 --> 54:19.117
- that I want to get this dress.
- Oh.

54:19.159 --> 54:22.078
The one you have on hold
is lovely, dear.

54:22.161 --> 54:25.914
I know, but I've just--
I've changed my mind.

54:25.998 --> 54:28.208
This is $ 1 ,000.

54:28.291 --> 54:31.085
And I have $ 1 ,000.

54:31.169 --> 54:34.213
[Mrs. Whittenmeyer]
The other one is only $300, dear.

54:34.296 --> 54:38.633
Um-- Is that dress for sale?

54:38.717 --> 54:43.137
It's just a lot of money to spend
on one of your dresses, Maggie.

54:43.179 --> 54:47.057
After all, you only wear them
for about ten minutes or so.

54:52.395 --> 54:54.355
Um, yeah, yeah.

54:54.438 --> 54:57.608
I guess that's true.

54:59.401 --> 55:02.862
Uh, the other dress is, is nice.

55:02.904 --> 55:05.114
- Mrs. Whittenheimer?
- Meyer.

55:05.197 --> 55:07.866
Whittenmeyer. Could I talk
to you just for a second?

55:07.950 --> 55:10.243
Come here. I don't know much
about this kind of thing.

55:10.327 --> 55:14.789
I'm from out of town.
But you're a salesperson, right?

55:14.872 --> 55:18.000
- You're here to sell wedding dresses.
- I've been here 30 years.

55:18.041 --> 55:21.836
Perfect! Because
Miss Carpenter is here to buy one.

55:21.878 --> 55:24.881
Ah. But not just any one.
She wants that one.

55:24.922 --> 55:28.467
- It's $1,000!
- Listen, Aunt Bee.

55:30.510 --> 55:33.972
Verbal communication was never perfect
for me. Let's try visual, all right?

55:36.390 --> 55:38.600
[Ike]
We're buying the dress.

55:38.684 --> 55:41.353
Now, we'll have
this nice beautiful dress.

55:41.394 --> 55:45.022
And anything else she wants,
it's hers. Okay? All right?

55:52.237 --> 55:54.864
[Sighs]
What do you think?

56:02.537 --> 56:04.455
Hmm?

56:07.958 --> 56:11.003
[Sighs]

56:11.086 --> 56:13.880
You look--

56:20.177 --> 56:22.220
[Sniffs]
You look fine.

56:22.304 --> 56:24.889
Fine.

56:26.516 --> 56:28.517
[Clears Throat]

56:28.601 --> 56:31.353
You're reading your newspaper
upside down.

56:31.436 --> 56:33.730
That's gotta
be better than "fine."

56:33.772 --> 56:36.399
Yeah.

56:36.482 --> 56:38.442
Come on, now.
Admire me.

56:38.484 --> 56:40.736
Get the whole picture.
Right?

56:40.778 --> 56:42.779
I'm gonna have my hair up
somehow.

56:42.863 --> 56:44.823
I don't know.
Maybe with a little in the back.

56:44.906 --> 56:47.825
And, my favorite feature...

56:47.909 --> 56:52.788
is that it kind of swishes
like a bell when I move.

56:54.414 --> 56:56.249
[Maggie]
% Ding, ding %

56:56.332 --> 56:59.210
% Ding, ding %

57:00.961 --> 57:02.880
It works.

57:02.963 --> 57:05.715
Bob will be very happy.

57:05.799 --> 57:10.636
Oh, Bob! We gotta go.
We gotta go meet Bob.

57:10.761 --> 57:14.014
Oh, jeez, yeah, I'm goin' to the luau.
I never miss it. The barbershop--

57:14.056 --> 57:17.225
Mrs. Pressman, we're ready
to order here, I think.

57:17.308 --> 57:19.185
I'm all out of the special--

57:19.227 --> 57:22.187
That's all right. I'm gonna have
the garden omelet, egg whites only.

57:22.229 --> 57:25.023
- Okay.
- That sounds good. I'll have the same.

57:25.065 --> 57:26.566
Of course.

57:26.649 --> 57:30.986
What is that? I can't even order eggs
without sarcasm from you?

57:31.070 --> 57:32.571
[Clears Throat]

57:32.654 --> 57:34.865
- You're on the same team now.
- What is that sound?

57:34.906 --> 57:36.783
[Clears Throat]
Have some water.

57:36.866 --> 57:40.203
- Penalty box. Penalty box. Hmm?
- What is it? Fur ball?

57:40.286 --> 57:43.622
Ike, Maggie is the sweetest person
you're ever gonna meet.

57:43.705 --> 57:45.791
But she focuses too much out there.

57:45.874 --> 57:48.334
She needs to start
focusing more in here.

57:48.418 --> 57:50.920
That's why I think
she's had, uh,

57:51.003 --> 57:56.091
whatever you wanna call 'em--
problems in the past.

57:56.174 --> 57:58.885
And that's what
we're working on. Focus.

57:58.927 --> 58:02.388
-Focus. Focus on Maggie. Focus.
- Mm-hmm.

58:02.471 --> 58:05.390
Focus on Bob. Focus on Bob.

58:05.474 --> 58:08.351
I've been runnin' Maggie
through these visualization exercises.

58:08.435 --> 58:11.103
All the sports shrinks
use this head stuff.

58:11.187 --> 58:13.689
Visualize the end zone.

58:13.772 --> 58:18.234
Visualize that hole-in-one.

58:18.276 --> 58:22.154
Tell me. When you get to the altar,
do you spike the bouquet?

58:22.238 --> 58:25.240
- Okay, you know what--
- Well, I'm off.

58:25.324 --> 58:27.826
A reporter's work
is never done.

58:27.909 --> 58:29.827
See you later.
Bye, Mrs. Pressman. Thank you.

58:29.911 --> 58:34.164
I'm gonna go focus
on your eggs, Bob.

58:35.666 --> 58:38.126
I'm glad you're here.
I wanted to try to explain.

58:38.210 --> 58:42.421
There are reasons why there have been
three weddings and no "I do's."

58:42.463 --> 58:45.966
You can't believe how much cake
we got stuck with!

58:46.049 --> 58:48.260
It's a wonder
I don't weigh 300 pounds!

58:48.301 --> 58:51.179
And then, her father bought
all that booze that nobody drank.

58:51.262 --> 58:53.180
- But he didn't mind that--
- Hi, Grandma.

58:53.264 --> 58:55.349
[Makes Kissing Sound]
Hi, Netta.

58:55.432 --> 59:00.186
Grammy is giving me the skinny
on why you run from marital bliss.

59:00.270 --> 59:02.688
Right. Netta,
cover up your ears.

59:04.398 --> 59:06.525
It's not that she's afraid
of the wedding.

59:06.608 --> 59:09.819
- She's afraid of the wedding night!
- Mmm.

59:09.903 --> 59:13.406
Innocent girls are terrified
of the one-eyed snake.

59:15.950 --> 59:17.993
Why, when I was a virgin bride,

59:18.076 --> 59:20.328
I took a knitting needle
to bed with me.

59:20.412 --> 59:22.121
Uh--
[Clears Throat]

59:22.163 --> 59:24.498
Grandma, I charmed...

59:24.582 --> 59:29.336
- the one-eyed snake a while ago.
- Oh, yeah. I forgot.

59:29.419 --> 59:33.840
Well, I'll tell you one thing. Your
grandpa never forgot that wedding night.

59:33.923 --> 59:35.841
Netta, you can take
your hands down.

59:35.925 --> 59:37.843
- The tea's cold.
- Good.

59:37.926 --> 59:40.804
Could you excuse us for a minute?
May I have a word with you, please?

59:40.887 --> 59:43.973
Oh. Bye, Netta. Bye.

59:44.056 --> 59:46.850
Thanks, Grammy.

59:46.934 --> 59:49.353
Uh-- [Clears Throat]

59:49.436 --> 59:52.772
I found this, and I didn't know
if it was something interesting.

59:52.856 --> 59:56.275
- My-- This is Miles Davis!
- I was cleaning out the attic and--

59:56.358 --> 59:59.152
This is very hard to find
in good condition.

59:59.236 --> 01:00:03.656
- Hold on to this. This is incredible.
- Why don't you take it?

01:00:05.283 --> 01:00:08.410
- Huh?
- Take it.

01:00:08.494 --> 01:00:13.581
You're figuring out what kind of music
I like, finding me a rare album.

01:00:13.665 --> 01:00:16.542
You're not trying
to butter me up, are you?

01:00:16.625 --> 01:00:18.877
I was cleaning out the attic,

01:00:18.961 --> 01:00:22.672
not attempting the impossible.

01:00:22.714 --> 01:00:26.175
I smell trouble.

01:00:26.384 --> 01:00:29.762
[Car Radio] This is Cory Flemming,
and I'll be featuring the music...

01:00:29.845 --> 01:00:33.807

What do we got here?

01:00:42.022 --> 01:00:44.357
[Maggie]
Come on, big guy.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.359
Oh, on our feet.
Here we go.

01:00:46.442 --> 01:00:49.194
Let's go, let's go,
big guy. Yeah.

01:00:49.278 --> 01:00:52.406
I haven't had any fun
since you got your driver's license.

01:00:52.489 --> 01:00:56.534
Let me give you a tip. I haven't
been having a whole lot of fun either.

01:00:57.952 --> 01:01:00.371
Steady.

01:01:00.454 --> 01:01:03.206
- Good boy, Porthole.
- His name's Skipper, Dad.

01:01:03.290 --> 01:01:05.708
- I changed it.
- Ah. Okay, step.

01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:09.879
- [Groans] I'll be back later, Travis.
- [Scoffs]

01:01:09.962 --> 01:01:12.673
- That guy Travis really has a problem.
- Mmm.

01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:14.799
- I'll get--
- Here we are.

01:01:14.883 --> 01:01:17.885
Okay. Steady.

01:01:17.969 --> 01:01:20.346
You're gonna lean,
I'm gonna push.

don't write anything--

01:01:28.603 --> 01:01:31.605
Forget about it.
Don't even think about it.

01:01:42.948 --> 01:01:46.910
I'm just so tired
of this whole scene.

01:01:46.951 --> 01:01:51.205
Why don't you just let him
sleep it off here in the truck?

01:01:51.247 --> 01:01:54.082
Come for a ride with me,
come back for him later.

01:01:56.751 --> 01:01:58.669

to come back here?

01:02:21.647 --> 01:02:25.484
Yeah. I had to come
run the store for my dad.

01:02:25.567 --> 01:02:29.529
[Ike] My dad had
a small printing business.

01:02:29.612 --> 01:02:32.781
He wanted me to become
a classical musician.

01:02:32.823 --> 01:02:35.200
My mother wanted me
to be a novelist.

So, l, uh--
I became a reporter.

01:02:51.047 --> 01:02:53.674
Not quite a novelist.
But as we all know,

01:02:53.757 --> 01:02:57.677
journalism is literature
in a hurry.

- Whoa!

01:03:21.322 --> 01:03:24.658
This car takes unleaded.
Your filter is clogged.

Can you fix it?

- Oh, good.

01:03:29.412 --> 01:03:31.331

01:03:36.835 --> 01:03:40.046
Well, if there's one thing
us New Yorkers know how to do,

01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:41.798
that's hail a cab.

01:03:41.881 --> 01:03:44.300
If there's no cab, we walk.

01:03:44.342 --> 01:03:48.428
Uh, well, if we saved
the battery here,

01:03:48.512 --> 01:03:50.764
there's a place just down the way.

It's quicker.

01:03:59.563 --> 01:04:01.648
Oh, be careful of snakes.

01:04:03.524 --> 01:04:05.860
- What?
- Snakes.

01:04:05.943 --> 01:04:07.861
I don't like snakes.

01:04:07.945 --> 01:04:10.572

- You're scaring me.
- [Chuckles] I'm scaring myself.

01:04:29.087 --> 01:04:33.007
Do you think there's
one right person for everybody?

01:04:33.091 --> 01:04:35.343
[Sighs]
No, but I think attraction...

01:04:35.384 --> 01:04:39.388
is too often mistaken
for rightness.

01:04:39.471 --> 01:04:42.974
Attraction is very misleading.

01:04:43.057 --> 01:04:45.393
- Yes, it is.
- Yeah.

01:04:45.434 --> 01:04:47.520
- And it doesn't mean anything.
- No.

01:04:47.561 --> 01:04:51.773
No, no.
It doesn't mean anything. It means--

01:05:00.864 --> 01:05:03.658

how to climb a fence.

a very interesting turn.

And end up in the papers?

I've been humiliated enough already
to last a lifetime. Thank you.

and migratory patterns of locusts...

Why do you think she ran?

All right?

01:06:19.263 --> 01:06:21.932

I don't think that's why she ran.

- No!

01:41:56.099 --> 01:41:58.684
I'm making friends with your cat.

01:42:00.019 --> 01:42:01.937
Is it okay that I'm here?

01:42:02.020 --> 01:42:05.815
I don't have much choice
in the matter, do l?

01:42:05.857 --> 01:42:08.985
But, I can't speak for Italics.
Traitor.

01:42:09.068 --> 01:42:11.111
[Purring]

01:42:11.195 --> 01:42:12.988
I don't blame you for being mad.

01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:15.782
Or furious.

01:42:16.866 --> 01:42:19.702
Irate? Livid.

01:42:19.785 --> 01:42:22.538
- [Meowing]
- What is it, Maggie?

01:42:22.621 --> 01:42:24.539
You here on business?

01:42:24.623 --> 01:42:27.959
By the way, I saw your lamps.

01:42:28.042 --> 01:42:32.129
They're terrific. Yeah, really.

01:42:32.212 --> 01:42:35.465
- It's something I've always wanted to--
- [Door Closes]

01:42:35.549 --> 01:42:38.926
You could make breaking and entering
into a new career.

01:42:42.137 --> 01:42:44.848
So, what are you
doing here anyway?

01:42:47.725 --> 01:42:51.270
I wanted to talk to you...

01:42:51.353 --> 01:42:56.524
about why I run,

01:42:56.608 --> 01:42:59.861
sometimes ride, away from things.

01:43:02.655 --> 01:43:05.324
- Does it matter?
- I think so.

01:43:05.407 --> 01:43:07.325
[Clears Throat]

01:43:07.409 --> 01:43:12.580
When I was walking down the aisle,
I was walking toward somebody...

01:43:12.663 --> 01:43:18.376
who had no idea who I really was.

01:43:18.460 --> 01:43:23.297
And it was only half
the other person's fault...

01:43:23.380 --> 01:43:28.134
because I had done everything
to convince him...

01:43:28.218 --> 01:43:30.303
that I was exactly what he wanted.

01:43:30.386 --> 01:43:33.847
So, it was good...

01:43:33.931 --> 01:43:38.727
that I didn't go through with it
because it would've been a lie.

01:43:38.810 --> 01:43:42.521
But you--

01:43:42.605 --> 01:43:45.065
You knew the real me.

01:43:47.109 --> 01:43:49.027
Yes, I did.

01:43:49.110 --> 01:43:51.612
I didn't.

01:43:52.989 --> 01:43:57.242
Still, I ended up
chasing a truck.

01:44:10.962 --> 01:44:14.882
I can't, um,
do anything about the truck.

01:44:16.842 --> 01:44:18.760
But, uh--

01:44:23.222 --> 01:44:25.933
- Benedict.
- Arnold.

01:44:26.016 --> 01:44:28.602
I love eggs Benedict.

01:44:28.685 --> 01:44:31.437
I hate all the other
kinds of eggs.

01:44:31.479 --> 01:44:35.691
I hate big weddings,
everybody staring.

01:44:35.774 --> 01:44:38.777
I'd like to get married on
a weekday while everybody's at work.

01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:42.447
And if I ride off into the sunset,
I want my own horse.

01:44:42.530 --> 01:44:44.991
- Should I be writing this down?
- And there's something else.

01:44:45.074 --> 01:44:47.576
No, you can tell me.
Don't--

01:44:47.659 --> 01:44:49.578
Okay.

01:44:54.582 --> 01:44:56.542
These are for you.

01:45:01.921 --> 01:45:04.924
- Used--
- Well, they're mine.

01:45:05.007 --> 01:45:09.970
I'm turning in
my running shoes to you.

01:45:13.223 --> 01:45:15.141
This is serious.

01:45:15.224 --> 01:45:16.892
And there's one more thing.

01:45:16.976 --> 01:45:19.853
I know, the mind reels that
there could be more after this.

01:45:19.937 --> 01:45:23.940
-But, um, if you could just have a seat.
-[Clears Throat]

01:45:27.276 --> 01:45:30.612
Let's just not have that there.

01:45:30.696 --> 01:45:33.406
Okay. Okay.

01:45:38.410 --> 01:45:42.205
- Oh, no. My, God, no.
- No, no. Don't hide your face.

01:45:42.289 --> 01:45:45.291
This happens once in a lifetime,
and it's definitely a first for me.

01:45:45.375 --> 01:45:48.460
You're not gonna want to miss it,
so pay close attention.

01:45:55.216 --> 01:45:59.803
I love you,
Homer Eisenhower Graham.

01:46:02.472 --> 01:46:03.765
Will you marry me?

01:46:03.765 --> 01:46:05.433
Will you marry me?

01:46:11.813 --> 01:46:13.732
[Laughs]

01:46:15.275 --> 01:46:18.486
I gotta think about this
a little bit.

01:46:18.569 --> 01:46:22.656
- Good. I was hoping you would say that.
- You were not! Not true.

01:46:22.739 --> 01:46:25.658
If you'd said yes, I wouldn't
be able to do this next part...

01:46:25.742 --> 01:46:27.577
and I've been practicing so let me--

01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:31.622
Okay.
[Exhales]

01:46:31.705 --> 01:46:34.416
- Ready?
- I'm listening.

01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:39.920
[Sighs]

01:46:42.256 --> 01:46:47.051
I guarantee
that we'll have tough times.

01:46:47.093 --> 01:46:50.221
And I guarantee
that at some point...

01:46:50.304 --> 01:46:53.765
one or both of us
will want to get out.

01:46:55.183 --> 01:46:58.019
But I also guarantee...

01:46:58.102 --> 01:47:01.564
that if I don't ask you to be mine,

01:47:01.647 --> 01:47:04.232
I'll regret it
for the rest of my life.

01:47:05.483 --> 01:47:07.944
'Cause I know in my heart...

01:47:07.986 --> 01:47:11.280
you're the only one for me.

01:47:18.328 --> 01:47:20.955
That's a pretty
good speech, Maggie.

01:47:21.038 --> 01:47:24.499
I borrowed it from
this writer I know.

01:47:26.876 --> 01:47:29.545
So?

01:47:42.598 --> 01:47:46.935
%[Miles Davis]

01:47:55.651 --> 01:47:58.111
Dance with me.

01:48:21.255 --> 01:48:24.466
[Pastor] We are gathered here
today to celebrate the union...

01:48:24.508 --> 01:48:27.844
of Maggie Carpenter and Ike Graham.

01:48:40.188 --> 01:48:43.024
- Do you have the rings?
- Yes.

01:48:43.065 --> 01:48:46.276
Do you, Ike, take Maggie
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

01:48:49.821 --> 01:48:51.739
I do.

01:48:51.823 --> 01:48:56.201
Do you, Maggie, take Ike
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

01:48:56.243 --> 01:48:58.203
I do.

01:48:58.245 --> 01:49:00.997
[Pastor]
In this life that you share together,

01:49:01.039 --> 01:49:05.000
may your individuality
strengthen your love.

01:49:05.084 --> 01:49:08.253
With the power vested in me,

01:49:08.337 --> 01:49:13.049
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:49:13.091 --> 01:49:15.968
You may kiss the bride.

01:49:29.187 --> 01:49:30.730
[Applauding]

01:49:45.826 --> 01:49:48.412
Guess what. She did it!

01:49:48.495 --> 01:49:50.747
Maggie Carpenter got married.

01:49:50.831 --> 01:49:53.083
% Alleluia %

01:49:58.045 --> 01:50:00.922
Betty, she did it. She did it!
