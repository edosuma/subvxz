and we got it out to the planets
that needed it.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.243

since the last reported outbreak.

00:12.345 --> 00:14.142
That's right, I'm chalking that one up
to the win column.

Look, all I'm saying is
let's not get carried away.

00:16.083 --> 00:18.381
Yes, we stopped them this time,
but you can be damn sure

00:18.485 --> 00:21.477
they're already thinking up some other
means of spreading fear and destruction

00:21.588 --> 00:22.577
through this galaxy.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.554
Yeah, that's why we call them
the bad guys.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.888
And by the looks of things
the next one's gonna be something big.

00:26.993 --> 00:29.962
Priors are already starting to step up
the rhetoric with all this talk of doomsday

00:30.063 --> 00:32.623

between the light and darkness.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.166

Shut her down.

00:47.481 --> 00:49.642
Your mission has been scrapped.

00:50.250 --> 00:53.242
-Why?
-Because you're needed elsewhere.

01:02.028 --> 01:03.154
General, what's going on?

01:03.263 --> 01:06.721
A team of representatives from
the lnternational Oversight Advisory

01:06.833 --> 01:09.063
are going on a tour of the Gamma site.

01:09.169 --> 01:13.196

as their official escort.

-TEAL'C: That is a most unusual request.
-lt will be lOA's first time offworld.

01:17.944 --> 01:21.311
The President wants to make sure
it goes off without a hitch.

01:21.414 --> 01:25.407
He figures, who better to ensure that
than our top team?

01:25.619 --> 01:28.611
-Sir, I don't mean to gripe.
-Permission to gripe granted.

it will take us less than one second
to get there.

04:44.250 --> 04:48.550
Just to clarify, I'm going to be

-That's right.

04:51.891 --> 04:55.292
And the chances
of my being reassembled incorrectly?

04:55.395 --> 04:56.953
Highly unlikely.

05:02.402 --> 05:04.370
But not impossible?

05:04.704 --> 05:06.501
That's a word I stopped using
nine years ago

05:06.606 --> 05:08.801
when I joined the Stargate program.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.889
This planet was chosen for several reasons

05:25.992 --> 05:28.187
including its unique
radioactive ionosphere,

05:28.294 --> 05:31.195
which makes it difficult to lock onto
surface targets from orbit.

05:31.297 --> 05:35.028
-So no one can steal the stargate?
-You can't be too careful these days.

05:35.135 --> 05:39.094
We have over 30 scientists engaged
in ongoing projects here at any given time.

05:39.205 --> 05:41.730
This is Dr. Myers, our lead entomologist.

05:42.075 --> 05:45.272
Doctor, would you mind telling us
a little bit about your research?

05:45.578 --> 05:46.670
Yes.

05:46.846 --> 05:50.247
I'm studying an asexual,
fast-reproducing insect,

05:50.683 --> 05:54.414
responsible for the devastation
of numerous offworld crops.

05:54.521 --> 05:55.647
A space bug.

05:56.322 --> 05:58.290
Right. Space bugs.

05:58.992 --> 06:03.656
However, for the purposes of my research,
I refer to them as R75.

06:04.064 --> 06:08.433
Now, the fact that these insects have only
manifested themselves on planets

06:08.535 --> 06:12.631
recently visited by Priors
makes their analysis a top priority.

06:12.739 --> 06:15.731
Is there anything to indicate
that this is more than mere coincidence?

06:15.842 --> 06:17.070
No, not yet.

06:17.277 --> 06:20.576
Now, our initial research
proved incredibly challenging

06:20.680 --> 06:24.639
due to the short life spans
of the R75 specimens

06:24.918 --> 06:28.251
until we succeeded in dramatically
increasing their life cycles

06:28.354 --> 06:30.788
by depriving them of sustenance.

06:31.057 --> 06:33.617
They feed,
and they die within a matter of hours.

06:33.793 --> 06:37.422
They starve, then they live.
So far it's been three days and counting.

06:37.530 --> 06:39.157
Would you stop that, please?

06:40.733 --> 06:42.257
A bit lethargic, aren't they?

06:43.002 --> 06:44.026
(CLEARING THROAT)

06:49.809 --> 06:50.867
Look at those.

06:51.311 --> 06:52.801
They're nocturnal.

06:53.246 --> 06:57.580
No, they function during the daylight.
They just prefer the darkness.

06:58.051 --> 07:00.383
They spend most of their time
burrowing underground,

07:00.487 --> 07:02.387
consuming crops from the roots up.

07:02.989 --> 07:06.516
Now, R75 also displays
a rather interesting defense mechanism,

07:06.626 --> 07:08.787
which we're still in process of studying.

07:09.462 --> 07:10.296

their enemies, such as birds, for instance.

07:53.706 --> 07:55.537
of the job Stargate Command is doing...

07:55.642 --> 07:57.701
Daniel Jackson,
the problem is not the lOA.

07:57.810 --> 08:00.108
Okay, if we can somehow reassure
the Chinese government.

08:00.213 --> 08:02.443
Oh, I think they're looking
for more than reassurances.

08:02.549 --> 08:04.346
Well, can you blame them?
I mean, three years ago

08:04.450 --> 08:06.281
we promised to share
all offworld technologies.

08:06.386 --> 08:07.910

I'm right. We'll leave it at that.

but to maintain its air of secrecy

-Perhaps it's time that changed.

Well, I can't say for sure,

but my guess is that the bug
must have laid its eggs in him.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.050
Colonel, do you read?

15:20.886 --> 15:23.878
It's all right. I imagine
it's just a little power fluctuation.

15:23.990 --> 15:25.150
(CHUCKLING) Nothing to worry about.

15:26.392 --> 15:29.156
-Oh, damn it.
-That's enough of this.

15:31.263 --> 15:33.493
-Colonel, what's the situation?
-Not good.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.794
There were thousands of those things
in the pod.

15:36.068 --> 15:37.763
They killed one of my men
before we retreated.

15:37.870 --> 15:40.168
-We lost the Gate Room?
-We need to take it back.

15:40.272 --> 15:41.637
Sounds like a plan.

15:42.575 --> 15:47.137
Mr. Woolsey, my men will escort
you and your people to the surface.

15:47.246 --> 15:48.770
Get you to a safe location.

15:49.215 --> 15:52.343
Get you as far away from here as
possible until this situation is contained.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.442
I don't think so.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.822
-Excuse me?
-SG-1 will escort us out.

15:58.624 --> 16:00.751
They're here to ensure
the safety of this delegation.

16:00.860 --> 16:03.886
You understand that no one gets off
this planet until the gate is retaken.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.055
And I'm sure Colonel Pearson
and his people

16:06.165 --> 16:08.793
will do everything in their power
to make sure that happens.

16:08.901 --> 16:11.961
In the meantime,
you will take us to the surface.

16:12.104 --> 16:15.005
You will protect us
as per your orders from the Pentagon.

16:16.042 --> 16:18.670
All right. Get them out of here.

16:42.535 --> 16:43.934
WOOLSEY: Excuse me.

16:46.105 --> 16:48.403
Surely we could have taken a jeep.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.304
We're headed to an unmanned
research station.

16:50.409 --> 16:53.537
It's located approximately 10 clicks
from here, through dense forest.

16:53.646 --> 16:56.171
Then I have to ask
if this is really necessary.

16:56.282 --> 16:57.476
I mean, couldn't we just wait here

16:57.583 --> 16:59.710
until Colonel Pearson
gives us the all clear?

16:59.819 --> 17:01.582
Our orders were to take you
to the research station.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.314
That's where we're going.

17:04.323 --> 17:05.688
(CHIRPING)

17:10.463 --> 17:11.657
Teal'c?

17:18.237 --> 17:21.070
-What is that?
-It's the bugs.

17:21.440 --> 17:22.407
(RUMBLING)

17:22.975 --> 17:24.602
What's happening?

17:24.710 --> 17:25.938
(PANTING)

17:26.712 --> 17:28.304
(YELLING)

17:39.492 --> 17:41.790
We have to move! Now!

17:48.334 --> 17:49.824
MlTCHELL: Hold up!

17:50.469 --> 17:51.766
Hold up.

17:53.405 --> 17:56.772
I think we can assume
the bugs got off the base.

17:56.876 --> 17:59.470
They must be using their echolocation
as a means to hunt their prey.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.205
JACKSON: Us. She means us.

18:01.313 --> 18:03.781
Where can we go?
They move underground.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.651
We need rocky terrain,
somewhere difficult for them to move.

18:07.987 --> 18:10.478
We can try the caves. This way.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.992
Get them inside.

18:32.411 --> 18:33.935
They're coming.

18:34.313 --> 18:35.780
They're highly sensitive to sound.

18:35.881 --> 18:39.009
The concussive force of our weapons
should be enough to drive them back.

18:39.351 --> 18:41.012
Are you serious?

18:41.754 --> 18:45.315
-Fine. Where do we shoot?
-CARTER: Just fire at the ground.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.331
(CHIRPING)

19:01.841 --> 19:03.138
Very nice.

19:04.343 --> 19:07.039
All right, folks, listen up.
We're surrounded by rock here,

19:07.146 --> 19:09.273
so there's no way the bugs are digging in.

19:09.381 --> 19:11.713
We've got the entrance covered.
Everything's gonna be fine.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.414
Till we run out of bullets.

19:21.627 --> 19:23.288
-Bullets.
-Yeah.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.393
What do you have for me, Chief?

19:30.502 --> 19:33.903
Sir, we are unable to acquire
a video feed from the surveillance cameras

19:34.006 --> 19:35.234
in the Gamma site Gate Room,

19:36.876 --> 19:39.709
but I've managed to pick up
motion-sensor telemetry.

19:48.787 --> 19:50.482
What have you found out?

19:50.689 --> 19:52.884
I learned that bugs still creep me out.

19:52.992 --> 19:55.961
It all started when I was a kid
and my parents took me on this picnic,

19:56.061 --> 19:58.222
and this bug crawled up on me...

19:58.898 --> 20:00.763
Maybe you'd prefer to hear this story
another time.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.731
-I doubt it.
-Oh, well...

20:04.603 --> 20:07.071
After careful analysis
of the telemetry we got back

20:07.172 --> 20:08.332
from the Gamma site Gate Room,

20:08.440 --> 20:12.501
I have determined that this is our culprit.
R75.

20:12.611 --> 20:13.635
The Prior bugs.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.543
Yeah, well, that connection
has yet to be determined,

20:15.648 --> 20:19.516
but you know we were originally
investigating this pesky little crop-killer

20:19.618 --> 20:22.052
as a possible weapon
against the addictive kassa harvest

20:22.154 --> 20:24.486
being produced and distributed
by the Lucian Alliance.

20:24.590 --> 20:28.185
And the various specimens
we got from different offworld locations

20:28.294 --> 20:29.283
were incredibly voracious.

20:29.395 --> 20:32.125
So voracious that they would literally
eat themselves to death,

20:32.231 --> 20:36.395
but when deprived of nourishment
these insects underwent some sort of...

20:36.502 --> 20:38.367
Fascinating. How do we kill them?

20:40.806 --> 20:44.333
Well, I mean, given the updated data,
I should be able to whip something up.

20:44.443 --> 20:48.243
Very well, as per protocol CR91,
we'll be sending the Odyssey

20:48.347 --> 20:51.077
to deliver the payload
from planetary orbit.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.681
CR91? Sir?

20:54.553 --> 20:57.078
The toxin will be lethal to humans as well.

20:57.189 --> 21:00.647
I mean, we'll have to be sure
that the Gamma site

21:00.759 --> 21:02.386
is evacuated before we deploy it.

21:02.494 --> 21:05.327
That's assuming there's anyone left
to evacuate.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.388
On the bright side,

21:31.824 --> 21:35.419
I was worried that my report
would make for a boring read.

21:36.695 --> 21:41.132
So I'm guessing we're gonna lose points
for this little incident.

21:43.769 --> 21:46.704
To be honest with you,
my report is a mere formality.

21:47.539 --> 21:50.474
Ultimately, it'll have no bearing
on my government's plan of action

21:50.576 --> 21:52.567
in regard to the Stargate program.

21:54.813 --> 21:57.543
What exactly should we be expecting
down the line?

21:58.083 --> 21:59.914
-Dr. Jackson...
-Daniel.

22:02.021 --> 22:03.181
Daniel.

22:03.756 --> 22:07.385
Maybe now is not the right time
to be having this conversation.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.060
When would be a good time?

22:11.163 --> 22:13.859
Perhaps when we're all back on Earth,

22:14.900 --> 22:18.893
and not having to worry about being
eaten alive by alien insects.

22:19.738 --> 22:23.037
Look, I understand your government
has issues with Stargate Command,

22:23.542 --> 22:27.034
but you cannot deny
the accomplishments, nor the significant...

22:27.146 --> 22:28.841
That has nothing to do with it.

22:30.249 --> 22:32.080
Daniel, let me ask you something.

22:33.018 --> 22:38.183
If nine years ago, it had been my country
and not the United States military,

22:38.624 --> 22:41.957
that had given you the opportunity
to travel to the stars,

22:43.062 --> 22:44.825
would it have made a difference to you?

22:45.564 --> 22:48.032
-Would you have turned us down?
-No, of course not.

22:48.767 --> 22:52.168
So long as the priority remained offworld
exploration that could benefit Earth,

22:52.538 --> 22:54.506
I would have gladly accepted the offer.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.334
I may hold you to that someday.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.180
At ease.

23:14.927 --> 23:17.122
Colonel Pearson, come in.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.560
(STATIC BUZZING)

23:18.864 --> 23:20.525
Pearson, come in.

23:23.068 --> 23:24.968
Gamma site, do you read?

23:28.607 --> 23:30.700
-Damn it.
-lf they haven't answered by now...

23:31.043 --> 23:32.442
Yeah, I know.

23:34.646 --> 23:37.479
-You okay?
-Yes, sir, I'm fine.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.218
I'm just a little bit rattled, is all.

23:48.494 --> 23:50.018
(CHIRPING)

24:07.346 --> 24:10.008
We have heard nothing
from the Gamma site since we left.

24:11.116 --> 24:13.676
I fear we must assume the worst
and plan accordingly.

24:13.785 --> 24:17.414
-Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.
-We cannot remain here indefinitely.

24:17.723 --> 24:19.714
Eventually, this position will be overrun.

24:19.825 --> 24:21.884
Yeah, we need to get as far away
as possible.

24:21.994 --> 24:23.689
Well, given the rate
these bugs are multiplying,

24:23.795 --> 24:26.059
it's doubtful
we could outpace them on foot.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.498
We must return for the F-302s.

24:31.136 --> 24:32.660
JACKSON: He's gone!

24:35.841 --> 24:38.105
-Airman Walker's missing.
-What do you mean "missing?"

24:38.210 --> 24:40.371
I just went to the front to check on him.
He's not there anymore.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.811
Perhaps he's just stepped out
to relieve himself.

24:44.216 --> 24:45.478
We'll be back.

24:56.895 --> 24:58.055
Walker.

25:40.806 --> 25:41.830
I think I got something.

25:42.474 --> 25:43.498
Coming to you.

25:55.287 --> 25:56.982
We're too late.

26:04.496 --> 26:05.656
Walker.

26:07.099 --> 26:09.329
Hey, just take it easy.

26:12.838 --> 26:14.203
(CHIRPING)

26:18.310 --> 26:21.279
Wait. Don't move.

26:31.490 --> 26:33.958
Jackson, why don't you
go back to the cave,

26:34.059 --> 26:36.926
tell Carter
Teal'c and I are going for the 302s.

26:37.696 --> 26:39.323
Where are you planning on landing them?

26:39.431 --> 26:41.456
We'll do an aerial surveillance,
we'll find some place,

26:41.566 --> 26:44.899
then we'll come back, we'll get everybody
and ferry them to a safe location.

26:45.003 --> 26:47.198
Okay. Where would that be?

26:47.673 --> 26:49.573
Far away from here.

26:50.642 --> 26:54.703
All right. Okay. Well, good luck.

27:05.557 --> 27:07.491
Let me ask you a question.

27:08.193 --> 27:09.854
In all the years
you were fighting the Goa'uld,

27:09.961 --> 27:11.326
did you ever just step back and say,

27:11.430 --> 27:14.331
"Sooner or later our luck's gonna run out,
we're gonna get our asses kicked?"

27:14.433 --> 27:16.594
-Never.
-Never? Not once?

27:17.336 --> 27:19.827
Even though you were massively
outnumbered, fighting an opponent

27:19.938 --> 27:21.906
with superior technology and firepower?

27:22.307 --> 27:24.434
They may have had the superior forces
and resources,

27:24.543 --> 27:26.534
but we possessed something far greater.

27:26.812 --> 27:29.645
-Which was?
-A just cause.

27:30.215 --> 27:32.615
I had no doubt the Goa'uld
would be defeated.

27:32.851 --> 27:36.412
Perhaps not in my lifetime,
but I knew eventually they would fall.

27:36.521 --> 27:39.684
And I have no doubt
the same fate awaits the Ori.

27:39.791 --> 27:42.817
See, that's what I like about you.
You're always positive.

27:42.928 --> 27:45.692
Hell, you're probably already past
this bug situation,

27:46.064 --> 27:48.828
thinking about what movie
you want to watch tomorrow night.

27:48.967 --> 27:50.730
I was considering OId School.

27:52.270 --> 27:53.794
"My boy, Blue."

27:54.706 --> 27:56.367
(EXPLOSIONS)

27:57.943 --> 28:00.639
-What was that?
-Wait here.

28:06.284 --> 28:08.115
Teal'c, Cameron, what's your status?

28:13.191 --> 28:15.819
-We're okay, Carter.
-JACKSON ON RADIO: What happened?

28:17.062 --> 28:19.064
Looks like the base self-destruct trigger.

28:21.967 --> 28:23.628
Gamma site's gone.

28:29.274 --> 28:31.538
CHAPMAN: How could the self-destruct
have been triggered?

28:31.710 --> 28:33.610
The bugs must have
gotten into the system.

28:33.912 --> 28:37.143
What difference does it make now?
The base has been destroyed!

28:37.249 --> 28:40.810
-Please calm down.
-Don't tell me to calm down!

28:40.919 --> 28:42.511
If we'd been allowed
to leave on schedule...

28:42.621 --> 28:44.782
Please, keep your voice down.

28:45.590 --> 28:48.115
I am sick of being told what to do.

28:48.693 --> 28:52.060
Why should I listen to you?
Why should any of us listen to you?

28:52.164 --> 28:54.724
Because you are alerting the bugs
to our presence.

29:00.272 --> 29:01.899
Colonel, a word.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.410
I understand you're doing everything
in your power to help us,

29:10.515 --> 29:11.539
and I appreciate that,

29:11.650 --> 29:15.142
but I think you're being a bit insensitive
to our needs right now.

29:15.253 --> 29:18.188
All I'm asking is for a little reassurance.

29:18.290 --> 29:20.758
A few words to let them know
that everything is gonna be okay.

29:20.859 --> 29:23.123
I don't think it's too much to ask,
all things considered.

29:25.197 --> 29:28.530
Mr. Woolsey, if I could go back in time,

29:28.900 --> 29:32.734
which admittedly is an opportunity
I am occasionally presented with,

29:32.838 --> 29:35.966
I would have made sure
that we left the base as scheduled.

29:36.074 --> 29:38.838
But the reality is,
for the time being we are stuck here,

29:38.944 --> 29:41.412
trapped in this cave,
surrounded by predatory insects

29:41.513 --> 29:43.572
with no way of getting to the stargate.

29:43.882 --> 29:46.817
Now, I'm sorry,
but I'm gonna have a hard time

29:46.918 --> 29:51.082
mustering up a convincing pep talk,
all things considered.

29:52.257 --> 29:53.383
I see.

29:55.494 --> 29:59.089
In that case, I'd just like to point out
that this routine offworld excursion

29:59.197 --> 30:00.459
has turned into a disaster,

30:00.665 --> 30:03.725
and the ramifications
for Stargate Command will be enormous.

30:03.835 --> 30:08.534
Saving our lives would go a long way
toward minimizing the damage.

30:09.541 --> 30:11.099
(WHISPERING) I'll keep that in mind.

30:16.448 --> 30:19.076
Don't worry.
She said everything is going to be okay.

30:21.620 --> 30:24.282
I'm telling you,
it's time you got your own place.

30:25.123 --> 30:28.524
Well, I endeavored to establish
a life off-base last year.

30:28.860 --> 30:31.590
I even went so far as to acquire
my own apartment.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.355
Unfortunately, it did not work out.

30:34.599 --> 30:36.362
Yeah, you got framed for murder.

30:36.668 --> 30:39.228
But you can't let one bad experience
put you off.

30:39.804 --> 30:42.637
Hell, first time I moved out,
I lived next door to a guy

30:42.741 --> 30:45.209
who practiced his drum solos
all night long.

30:46.244 --> 30:49.008
When we get back,
I'm gonna help you find your own place.

30:49.114 --> 30:51.742
-That will be unnecessary.
-Dude, what are friends for?

30:51.850 --> 30:54.751
For listening when they are told,
"That will be unnecessary."

30:55.086 --> 30:56.451
(RUMBLING)

31:29.754 --> 31:31.551
What the hell is taking them?

31:41.099 --> 31:44.591
-JACKSON ON RADIO: Where are you guys?
-Requesting radio silence.

31:45.203 --> 31:47.034
(CHIRPING)

32:04.623 --> 32:06.523
(WHISPERING) I think we're good to go.

32:08.026 --> 32:11.427
Perhaps we should keep any
unnecessary conversation to a minimum.

32:12.797 --> 32:14.094
Okay.

32:26.611 --> 32:27.771
(KNOCKING)

32:28.279 --> 32:32.010
Sir, we just received a subspace
transmission from the Odyssey.

32:32.117 --> 32:34.051
Its ETA is five hours.

32:34.886 --> 32:37.650
And the Pentagon's on line two.

32:37.756 --> 32:38.848
(SIGHS)

32:38.957 --> 32:40.481
Thank you, Chief.

32:47.432 --> 32:48.831
Landry here.

32:50.935 --> 32:52.527
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

32:57.075 --> 33:00.408
-All right, scratch Plan B.
-What do we do now?

33:00.912 --> 33:03.608
Maybe if the gate is buried,
they won't be able to send a rescue team.

33:03.715 --> 33:05.148
Which means they'll send the Odyssey.

33:05.250 --> 33:06.945
In fact,
it's probably already on its way here.

33:07.052 --> 33:11.113
So all you gotta do is sit back, relax.
Everything's gonna be fine.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.290
Theoretically.

33:15.727 --> 33:17.160
Theoretically?

33:17.495 --> 33:21.431
Theoretically, yes, the Odyssey could
come and beam us off the planet's surface.

33:21.533 --> 33:22.795
But?

33:25.336 --> 33:28.737
Look, I'm sorry, but there's no point
in sugarcoating this.

33:28.873 --> 33:31.068
If Stargate Command is operating
under the assumption

33:31.176 --> 33:34.373
that the base has been lost,
they'll enact protocol CR91.

33:34.646 --> 33:35.738
What's that?

33:35.847 --> 33:38.111
Once in orbit,
the Odysseywill launch a payload,

33:38.216 --> 33:41.652
probably a neurotoxin,
that will wipe out R75.

33:41.753 --> 33:43.015
That will allow Stargate Command

33:43.121 --> 33:45.180
to mount a salvage operation
at the Gamma site.

33:45.290 --> 33:47.155
But they'll beam us out of here first.

33:47.258 --> 33:50.091
Our transmitters won't work because
of the interference in the atmosphere.

33:50.195 --> 33:51.321
What about our life signs?

33:52.630 --> 33:54.928
Because the bugs are multiplying
at an alarming rate,

33:55.033 --> 33:57.524
and because of the fact
that we are completely surrounded,

33:57.969 --> 34:00.062
the Odysseywon't be able
to pick up our individual readings

34:00.171 --> 34:03.140
-inside a sea of life signs.
-Oh, my God.

34:03.241 --> 34:05.766
What you're saying is
that they're coming out all this way,

34:05.877 --> 34:09.074
but instead of rescuing us,
they're going to kill us with poison gas?

34:09.180 --> 34:11.876
Because they have no way of knowing
that we're still here.

34:12.283 --> 34:15.946
Then we're going to die on this planet,
25,000 light years from Earth.

34:16.054 --> 34:19.353
Hey, relax.
For starters, it's only 24,000 light years.

34:21.392 --> 34:23.519
What's your ETA for Odyssey?

34:23.828 --> 34:25.796
I have no way of knowing
exactly when it was sent,

34:27.232 --> 34:29.598
but given the approximate time
that Stargate Command lost contact

34:29.701 --> 34:32.431
with the Gamma site,
and allowing for production of the toxin,

34:32.871 --> 34:34.304
I'd say inside of a few hours.

34:36.808 --> 34:38.241
We must find a way
to contact the Odyssey

34:38.343 --> 34:40.277
to let their crew know that we are alive.

34:40.378 --> 34:42.346
Except our only way
of communicating with that ship

34:42.447 --> 34:44.415
-went up with the Gamma base.
-Maybe not.

34:44.516 --> 34:45.847
The research station.

34:46.050 --> 34:47.415
It must have some sort
of communication array

34:47.519 --> 34:49.350
that allows it to transmit data
back to the Gamma site.

34:49.454 --> 34:51.922
But is it capable of reaching a ship
in planetary orbit?

34:52.023 --> 34:53.923
It could if I had some time to work on it.

34:54.025 --> 34:56.550
Then all we have to do
is get to the research station.

34:56.661 --> 34:59.687
Right, and the only thing
between us and it,

35:00.064 --> 35:01.964
is five miles of forest
and a whole lot of bugs.

35:06.738 --> 35:08.000
Piece of cake.

35:25.123 --> 35:27.158
-Keep moving.
-I cannot.

35:27.158 --> 35:27.283
-Keep moving.
-I cannot.

35:30.295 --> 35:31.489
We're almost there.

35:31.596 --> 35:33.860
That is what you said
almost half an hour ago.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.862
The transmission we'll be sending
will enable the Odyssey

35:37.969 --> 35:41.632
to triangulate our position
and pick up our individual life signs.

35:41.739 --> 35:44.264
But we all have to be
within the target area.

35:44.576 --> 35:48.478
-We've been walking for hours.
-We don't have time to sit around.

35:48.813 --> 35:51.407
We are in violent agreement.

35:51.716 --> 35:53.809
You know what? Sit here.

35:54.419 --> 35:57.354
You cover our six, but stay alert.

35:57.488 --> 36:00.616
You'll hear the bugs coming,
but tree ferrets give no warning.

36:01.793 --> 36:05.092
-Tree ferrets?
-Yeah, nasty buggers.

36:05.363 --> 36:08.890
Swoop down and separate a man's head
from his torso before he can blink.

36:14.239 --> 36:15.638
You're lying.

36:23.248 --> 36:24.374
Wait.

36:27.819 --> 36:30.253
-We're almost there.
-Stop saying that.

36:40.098 --> 36:41.395
There it is.

36:42.333 --> 36:44.028

37:55.340 --> 37:58.275
Colonel, is it working?

37:58.376 --> 38:01.504
It's too late. We're too late.

38:01.612 --> 38:04.445
-They're right outside.
-ls it going to work?

38:04.549 --> 38:05.914
Do you think you can make it work
in time?

38:11.255 --> 38:15.055
-Thank you, Mr. Woolsey.
-You're welcome.

38:27.772 --> 38:29.034
How's it going?

38:29.140 --> 38:30.767
I need to significantly boost the power

38:30.875 --> 38:33.400
in order to penetrate
the radioactivity in the ionosphere.

38:33.511 --> 38:35.445
All right, boost it already.

38:35.546 --> 38:37.173
Yeah, I think I'm good.

38:37.815 --> 38:39.578

38:53.898 --> 38:56.298
The vibrations being generated
by the communications array

38:56.401 --> 38:58.835
must be attracting the bugs.
Think you can hold them off?

38:58.936 --> 39:01.666

we're almost out of ammo?

It's time to improvise.

39:34.472 --> 39:35.632
Okay, go.

39:37.175 --> 39:39.234
How long before they receive
the transmission?

39:39.343 --> 39:41.743
They should pick it up
as soon as they enter orbit.

39:41.846 --> 39:44.576
But like I said, we have no way
of knowing when that's gonna be.

Surprisingly minimal.
You may face an official reprimand,

41:37.428 --> 41:42.730
but the lOA recognizes the fact that these
were circumstances beyond your control.

an inordinate amount of complaining,

41:45.603 --> 41:46.934
but off the record,

the lOA has nothing
but praise for the job you're doing here.

It was an eye-opening experience.

42:12.563 --> 42:14.622
While you were gone, we received reports
