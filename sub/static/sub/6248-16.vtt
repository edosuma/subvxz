WEBVTT

00:01.130 --> 00:02.600
I'm supposed to
be on vacation,

00:03.005 --> 00:04.860
you know, spending
time with Sully.

00:05.115 --> 00:07.353
Oh, that's a good lesson
for Sully, then, huh ?

00:07.375 --> 00:10.252
Next time he actually
takes youawayon vacation,

00:10.331 --> 00:12.697
you should go away,
you know, leave town.

00:12.782 --> 00:14.317
You had a vacation
and never left town.

00:14.402 --> 00:15.873
That wasn't a vacation,
it was a suspension.

00:15.979 --> 00:17.464
Plus compulsory therapy.

00:17.465 --> 00:19.639
Hey, dude, don't
knock therapy, okay ?

00:19.788 --> 00:21.323
Dr. Wyatt has
helped me realize

00:21.365 --> 00:23.347
that there are
certain pressures

00:23.496 --> 00:24.711
that build up on the job

00:24.796 --> 00:27.290
and I need creative ways...
We do everything together.

00:27.327 --> 00:28.115
...of dealing with them.

00:28.142 --> 00:29.954
Whoa, what exactly do
you have to contend with

00:29.911 --> 00:30.956
on the job
that I don't ?

00:31.062 --> 00:33.258
You, Bones, you don't have
to contend with you.

00:33.623 --> 00:35.669
So we got a trunk.
Looks like it's been wrapped

00:35.712 --> 00:36.756
with chains,

00:36.799 --> 00:38.434
battered up pretty good,
most likely came

00:38.498 --> 00:40.544
through the sluiceways upstream
in Maryland.

00:40.587 --> 00:41.695
Is it locked ?

00:41.951 --> 00:43.251
Not anymore, it isn't.

00:43.357 --> 00:44.551
Is there a body in there ?

00:44.956 --> 00:46.299
Sort of.

00:51.465 --> 00:52.829
Beats the hell
out of me

00:52.957 --> 00:53.767
what the deal is with this one.

00:54.598 --> 00:55.877
The head looks flat,

00:55.963 --> 00:58.243
as if the skull has been
totally pulverized.

00:58.364 --> 00:59.068
Maybe she got run over

00:59.089 --> 00:59.814
by a steamroller ?

01:00.176 --> 01:01.135
What are you saying ?

01:01.199 --> 01:02.840
She was killed
by Wile E. Coyote ?

01:03.927 --> 01:04.495
Okay, I want

01:04.516 --> 01:07.501
the whole kip and canoodle
transported to the Jeffersonian.

01:07.565 --> 01:07.864
Kit...

01:07.949 --> 01:08.972
and caboodle.

01:09.505 --> 01:10.997
Why don't we just
wrap this up fast,

01:11.082 --> 01:12.574
so we can get you back
on your vacation ?

01:12.638 --> 01:14.429
Thank you, I'd
appreciate that.

01:18.689 --> 01:20.004
You have got to be kidding.

01:21.524 --> 01:22.632
What's with the tone ?

01:22.696 --> 01:24.390
You want me to take this face

01:24.518 --> 01:26.436
and build a
skull for it ?

01:26.543 --> 01:28.013
Can you do it ?
No.

01:28.141 --> 01:30.540
You're always taking skulls
and putting on faces.

01:30.671 --> 01:32.205
Can't you simply reverse
the process ?

01:32.206 --> 01:33.037
No.

01:33.122 --> 01:35.680
Why not ?
BecauseIam
a human being.

01:40.640 --> 01:42.111
She's missing
every bone in her body ?

01:42.665 --> 01:44.306
Her skeleton was removed.

01:44.391 --> 01:45.329
Oh.

01:45.415 --> 01:48.569
All right, leaving
the third circle of Hell,

01:48.782 --> 01:49.755
but before I go,

01:50.608 --> 01:51.737
I think she's Asian.

01:51.929 --> 01:53.719
Don't base that on skin tone.

01:53.805 --> 01:55.041
She was boiled,
which is

01:55.116 --> 01:57.247
why we can only get
partial fingerprints.

01:57.354 --> 01:59.272
I'm not going off skin tone.

01:59.997 --> 02:01.230
I'm going off her hair.

02:02.808 --> 02:04.278
I have an idea
for the face--

02:04.470 --> 02:05.728
I... if you can remove
the head

02:05.813 --> 02:07.156
from the rest
of the skin sack.

02:07.292 --> 02:09.758
Please, God, I am not
out of earshot yet.

02:11.663 --> 02:12.921
The victim was boiled.

02:13.049 --> 02:15.756
Then a number of incisions were
made from the top of the skull,

02:15.734 --> 02:18.441
around her right ear
and down her right side.

02:19.038 --> 02:20.168
Then from her left foot,

02:20.253 --> 02:22.206
along the outside
of the body to her left hip.

02:22.334 --> 02:24.593
Someone with medical traing ?
Definitely not.

02:24.785 --> 02:25.787
An untrained hand

02:25.936 --> 02:27.172
but a very sharp instrument.

02:27.279 --> 02:27.663
Boiled ?

02:27.812 --> 02:30.242
The entire skeletal
structure removed,

02:30.449 --> 02:32.878
then the skin was sewn
back around the organs.

02:33.028 --> 02:34.370
It doesn't fit
any kind of

02:34.477 --> 02:36.459
ritual killing
I've ever heard or read about.

02:36.566 --> 02:39.139
The organs are damaged
due to the clumsy cutting,

02:39.078 --> 02:39.760
but everything's there...

02:39.845 --> 02:41.252
except the brain and the eyes.

02:41.316 --> 02:42.190
Oh, God.

02:42.403 --> 02:43.298
Must have been
difficult

02:43.405 --> 02:44.939
to remove all the smaller bones,

02:45.024 --> 02:46.111
like the phalanges.

02:46.346 --> 02:47.674
It's all gone.

02:47.759 --> 02:49.145
I didn't even find one bone.

02:49.251 --> 02:50.019
The algae in the trunk

02:50.125 --> 02:53.685
is cyanobacteria called
microcystis aeruginosa.

02:53.832 --> 02:57.516
The size of the...
scum colony indicates

02:57.596 --> 02:59.237
eight days submersion.

02:59.373 --> 03:00.217
Dr. Brennan.

03:01.347 --> 03:03.308
Have I offended you in some way ?

03:03.585 --> 03:05.461
Dr. Saroyan
said "no bones," so...

03:05.844 --> 03:06.504
You know
what that means ?

03:06.632 --> 03:08.766
I'm back on vacation.

03:08.891 --> 03:10.533
No bones, no Bones.

03:11.828 --> 03:13.768
I was the second "bones."

03:14.642 --> 03:15.707
That's very witty.

03:18.414 --> 03:21.121
Essentially, all we have to do
is refillthe empty head.

03:22.379 --> 03:23.825
Like a balloon.

03:23.931 --> 03:25.828
Which is literally
what we did.

03:25.935 --> 03:27.576
Oh, no, you
did not.

03:27.725 --> 03:29.601
Put a bladder
inside the head

03:29.729 --> 03:32.265
and inflate it very slowly.

03:35.297 --> 03:36.406
This is...

03:38.452 --> 03:39.432
It's...

03:40.263 --> 03:41.691
absolutely...

03:41.969 --> 03:43.546
Brilliant ?
Useless.

03:43.866 --> 03:45.482
You need the exact
shape of a skull

03:45.567 --> 03:47.059
to get a likeness, not just a...

03:47.486 --> 03:48.466
This is...

03:48.615 --> 03:50.107
Turn that off.

03:50.555 --> 03:52.644
Oh, my God.

03:52.814 --> 03:55.180
You guys are perverse.

03:55.619 --> 03:56.791
Dr. Brennan was right.

03:56.919 --> 03:59.711
Bone people should
only do bone things.

04:36.168 --> 04:38.363
Have a good episode !

04:47.509 --> 04:48.511
Hello !

04:50.195 --> 04:51.197
Hey !

04:51.303 --> 04:52.305
Doctor Brennan !

04:52.433 --> 04:54.150
Agent Sullivan I presume.

04:55.006 --> 04:56.327
So ! What do you think ?

04:56.498 --> 04:58.245
I think you're very dirty.

04:58.395 --> 04:59.610
Wow !

05:00.121 --> 05:01.293
- You've got something.
- Oh.

05:02.067 --> 05:03.062
Oh.

05:03.190 --> 05:04.746
Huh... Come on aboard, here.

05:05.620 --> 05:07.175
So i didn't think I'd see you 
for a couple days.

05:07.281 --> 05:09.711
Well, I know... It's strange 
but I actually...

05:10.521 --> 05:12.311
would rather spend time 
with you than work.

05:12.759 --> 05:14.080
Wow. I'm flattered.

05:16.589 --> 05:17.591
So...

05:18.316 --> 05:19.317
You're renting it ?

05:20.021 --> 05:21.705
Well, I...

05:22.237 --> 05:23.708
was thinking about buying her.

05:23.921 --> 05:24.923
Wow...

05:25.387 --> 05:26.154
Can you afford it  ?

05:26.218 --> 05:29.287
If i liquidate everything and 
borrow heavily, not at all.

05:30.886 --> 05:32.719
Seems, you live on it ?

05:33.411 --> 05:34.417
Her.

05:34.460 --> 05:36.058
You know, live on her.

05:36.421 --> 05:37.913
And before I commit,

05:38.339 --> 05:40.342
I wanna spend a night on her

05:41.003 --> 05:42.197
With you.

05:42.474 --> 05:43.625
Oh, what would that prove  ?

05:43.821 --> 05:45.510
Call it sexual Feng shui.

05:45.654 --> 05:47.700
I don't think that's a real thing.

05:47.935 --> 05:49.746
If it doesn't work for us, 
I don't want this boat.

05:56.852 --> 05:57.854
Wow.

05:57.960 --> 05:59.516
Apparently, you do think
it's a real thing.

06:08.172 --> 06:09.771
I can't find anything

06:09.867 --> 06:12.504
on how to estimate the height
of a body without bones.

06:12.589 --> 06:15.765
Does the skin stretch or
contract without a skeleton ?

06:15.914 --> 06:18.919
Uh, boiled leather immersed in
water would tend to stretch,

06:19.047 --> 06:20.685
then contract as it dries.

06:21.026 --> 06:22.390
Maybe the principle applies.

06:22.603 --> 06:25.018
I'm finding bruising
on the torso.

06:25.977 --> 06:28.187
I'll subject the tissue
to reflectance spectroscopy

06:28.315 --> 06:30.766
to get at a rough idea
of when the blows were sustained

06:30.870 --> 06:32.042
and whether they were fatal.

06:32.405 --> 06:33.407
Dr. Saroyan ?

06:33.569 --> 06:35.635
The face debacle taught me
a lesson.

06:35.822 --> 06:38.170
I'm strictly a bone guy,
like Dr. Brennan.

06:38.508 --> 06:41.814
Which is exactly why
I called for you, bone boy.

06:42.728 --> 06:44.028
A patella ?
Yes.

06:44.135 --> 06:46.421
X- rays showed it was lodged in
the fatty tissue of the leg.

06:46.613 --> 06:48.766
A bone.
Something we can work with.

06:49.789 --> 06:50.954
It's just a kneecap, Zack.

06:51.046 --> 06:51.899
Don't get too excited.

06:52.091 --> 06:53.284
To you, it's just a kneecap.

06:53.498 --> 06:56.326
To Dr. Brennan, it's the
best part of a human being.

06:57.179 --> 06:58.223
Good to know.

07:04.292 --> 07:05.294
Hey.

07:09.891 --> 07:10.893
Ahoy the boat ?

07:11.551 --> 07:12.552
Booth ?

07:12.659 --> 07:13.661
Yeah, I need Bones.

07:16.091 --> 07:17.625
Permission to come
aboard or what ?

07:19.245 --> 07:22.617
Hey, man, uh,
is this important ?

07:22.814 --> 07:23.991
Yeah, we got a bone.

07:24.221 --> 07:24.967
Tell me about it.

07:25.841 --> 07:27.354
It's from the boneless girl.

07:28.547 --> 07:29.762
What kind of bone ?

07:34.439 --> 07:36.101
Here and here.

07:36.186 --> 07:37.423
Frontal spurring.

07:38.765 --> 07:40.172
What's that mean ?
Zack ?

07:40.449 --> 07:42.483
A lot of time spent
on the knees.

07:42.644 --> 07:44.685
Oh, so she's either
a nun or a prostitute.

07:44.919 --> 07:46.680
No, tendon attachments

07:46.748 --> 07:49.548
on the inside of the patella
also suggest squatting,

07:49.907 --> 07:50.851
which is not

07:50.861 --> 07:52.383
nun-like behavior.
You didn't need

07:52.393 --> 07:54.020
to interrupt my vacation
for this, you know.

07:54.201 --> 07:56.898
Well, you know, you said to call
if a bone showed up, and...

07:57.814 --> 07:58.773
this is a bone.

07:58.837 --> 08:01.365
The density of secondary
osteon structures

08:01.501 --> 08:03.469
suggests the victim was
in her early 20s

08:03.633 --> 08:04.554
at the time of her death.

08:04.703 --> 08:05.961
See, Zack is capable.

08:06.067 --> 08:07.069
You don't need me.

08:08.939 --> 08:10.439
It's an interesting shape.

08:10.449 --> 08:12.408
Square rather
than triangular.

08:12.547 --> 08:14.039
Classic nail-patella syndrome.

08:14.316 --> 08:16.938
It's a genetic defect,
also known as Fong's Disease.

08:17.108 --> 08:18.277
Fong's Disease, right.

08:18.473 --> 08:19.515
What's that ?

08:19.525 --> 08:21.877
Angela said the victim's hair
suggested Asian.

08:21.887 --> 08:23.383
Our victim
may have grown up

08:23.393 --> 08:25.549
in a non-industrialized
rural environment.

08:25.628 --> 08:28.889
Well, early 20s, Asian, rural area.

08:29.166 --> 08:30.211
I'll check
with immigration.

08:30.403 --> 08:32.022
Zack will do
an osteological profile

08:32.193 --> 08:34.366
on the bone, see if we
can focus geographically,

08:34.509 --> 08:36.385
while I get back on vacation.

08:38.707 --> 08:41.159
Wow, Dr. Brennan
really likes that boat.

08:46.452 --> 08:48.442
I thought you said
you couldn't make a face.

08:48.850 --> 08:50.485
Well, did you hear
about Zack and Hodgins

08:50.495 --> 08:51.711
and the balloon
in the head ?

08:51.779 --> 08:53.749
Ha. Is it as bad
as it sounds ?

08:53.835 --> 08:54.616
Yes.

08:54.626 --> 08:56.978
The least I could do is
try to give her a face,

08:57.106 --> 08:57.980
poor woman.

08:58.598 --> 08:59.536
So...

08:59.813 --> 09:00.986
a boat, hmm ?

09:01.710 --> 09:03.266
Oh, Sully ? Yeah.

09:03.565 --> 09:05.500
Last month he wanted
to live in a tree house.

09:06.761 --> 09:07.805
He's like me.

09:08.232 --> 09:09.319
Yeah.

09:10.726 --> 09:11.642
No, I don't see that.

09:12.132 --> 09:15.195
Well, he's not really made
for all this murder and corpses

09:15.323 --> 09:17.604
and empty eye
sockets crap.

09:17.860 --> 09:19.416
He's a romantic.

09:19.671 --> 09:20.588
Unlike me ?

09:20.673 --> 09:21.462
No.

09:21.590 --> 09:23.551
You're a romantic
of a narrow kind.

09:23.636 --> 09:25.595
You live to
catch bad guys.

09:25.787 --> 09:27.172
Sully lives wide.

09:28.409 --> 09:30.881
Hey, I got a hit off the Homeland 
Security database.

09:31.989 --> 09:33.545
Li Ling Fan.

09:33.884 --> 09:36.636
Yeah, she's here on a Fiancé
Visa from mainland China.

09:36.985 --> 09:39.414
Fingerprints...
it's a match.

09:39.564 --> 09:40.825
Print this up for me.

09:40.885 --> 09:42.121
Yeah, this is the victim.

09:42.228 --> 09:44.466
Okay, I'll go, uh,
visit her fiancé tomorrow.

09:46.065 --> 09:48.153
I... I live wide, too.

09:49.629 --> 09:50.546
Far and wide.

09:51.057 --> 09:52.059
Right ?

09:52.187 --> 09:53.786
There's nothing wider
than Seeley Booth.

09:55.299 --> 09:56.301
Okay, then.

09:57.004 --> 09:58.070
My bad.

09:59.214 --> 10:00.578
Ling Fan is dead ?

10:01.260 --> 10:02.454
Are you certain ?

10:02.654 --> 10:04.990
When was the last time you saw
your wife, Mr. Harper ?

10:05.246 --> 10:06.695
Fan wasn't my wife.

10:06.781 --> 10:07.781
Well...

10:09.380 --> 10:12.641
she immigrated here
on a, um, Fiancé Visa

10:12.705 --> 10:15.134
and you're listed
as the, uh, fiancé.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.202
We called it off.

10:18.032 --> 10:18.991
Mutual thing.

10:19.141 --> 10:20.078
Well, you see,

10:20.249 --> 10:21.293
I don't believe that.

10:21.506 --> 10:23.766
I mean, a poor girl
from China travels

10:23.915 --> 10:26.899
thousands of miles
away from her family

10:27.048 --> 10:30.528
to be with the man
that she loves.

10:30.634 --> 10:32.062
It's not like she has
many options.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.963
So, uh, when was the last time
you saw her ?

10:36.069 --> 10:37.071
About a month ago.

10:37.412 --> 10:38.265
How did she die ?

10:38.371 --> 10:39.352
Yeah, we're still, uh,

10:39.480 --> 10:40.616
we're still looking into that.

10:42.172 --> 10:43.195
Foul play, right ?

10:43.536 --> 10:44.644
I mean, the FBI
wouldn't be asking

10:44.769 --> 10:46.669
so many questions
if it was an accident.

10:46.903 --> 10:47.830
So you, uh,

10:48.033 --> 10:49.546
so you get off
on all this, uh...

10:51.625 --> 10:52.903
Asian stuff, huh ?

10:53.330 --> 10:54.353
Martial arts ?

10:54.864 --> 10:55.632
Weapons ?

10:55.717 --> 10:58.104
I've dedicated my life to it.

10:58.274 --> 11:00.001
She had some bruising,
your fiancé.

11:00.939 --> 11:02.433
I don't know anything
about that.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.183
These, uh, weapons here,

11:05.268 --> 11:06.334
here are they, uh,

11:06.458 --> 11:07.890
genuine ?
Knockoffs.

11:07.996 --> 11:09.275
I can't afford the real thing.

11:09.403 --> 11:10.064
Really ?

11:10.213 --> 11:12.424
Since when does
a fence

11:12.807 --> 11:14.321
worry about affording things ?

11:14.640 --> 11:16.068
Details
like a criminal record,

11:16.218 --> 11:19.116
they tend to, uh, come up
during a murder investigation.

11:20.581 --> 11:21.412
Murder ?

11:21.540 --> 11:22.456
Homicide.

11:22.883 --> 11:24.268
See, I've, uh,
dedicated

11:24.396 --> 11:25.376
my life to it.

12:05.194 --> 12:07.432
I've been on Arab dhows
about this size,

12:07.614 --> 12:09.663
but I don't think I could
handle one all by myself.

12:10.182 --> 12:12.434
This is a lot more
high tech than a dhow.

12:14.011 --> 12:17.353
Why... Why didn't you ask me
to go out with you ?

12:17.521 --> 12:18.950
I'm a good sailor.

12:19.376 --> 12:20.314
Well, you know,

12:20.442 --> 12:22.275
I've got to be able
to handle it by myself.

12:22.594 --> 12:25.759
I'd much rather have
a crew... you, in fact...

12:25.887 --> 12:28.999
but what if you got
conked on the head,

12:29.127 --> 12:30.214
and ran off
with a pirate ?

12:32.303 --> 12:33.177
Ahoy, the boat.

12:33.304 --> 12:34.704
Oh... Booth...

12:34.981 --> 12:37.092
Don't tell me.
You found another bone.

12:37.241 --> 12:40.656
Well, I've got this Chinese book
that needs translating.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.250
Maybe you, uh, got somebody

12:42.309 --> 12:44.076
at the Jeffersonian
we could, uh, talk to ?

12:44.268 --> 12:46.271
No ! I'm on vacation.

12:46.648 --> 12:48.062
Well, he'll just
keep showing up.

12:48.232 --> 12:50.215
Might as well pitch in and get
the case solved.

12:51.998 --> 12:54.578
It's a ledger for buying and
selling weapons.

12:54.748 --> 12:56.508
Illegal
weapons.

12:58.691 --> 13:00.865
One entry
refers to this.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.082
It's a Jian,

13:02.529 --> 13:03.616
a double-edged
sword.

13:03.744 --> 13:05.023
A dergu...

13:05.513 --> 13:06.878
This fellow's not Chinese,
correct ?

13:07.069 --> 13:08.092
How can you tell ?

13:08.220 --> 13:09.435
These characters are

13:09.521 --> 13:10.906
labored, overly formal.

13:11.055 --> 13:13.947
Professor Shi Jon Chen
is a highly-respected

13:14.096 --> 13:15.120
cultural
anthropologist

13:15.247 --> 13:17.102
- who specializes...
- Yeah, he's one of you.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.402
Yeah, I get it.

13:18.445 --> 13:20.086
You definitely
didn't get all

13:20.192 --> 13:20.768
the weapons.

13:21.002 --> 13:23.809
Including this...
a Xing shuang.

13:25.344 --> 13:26.282
A Flying Horse.

13:26.388 --> 13:28.157
A very rare ornate dagger.

13:28.562 --> 13:29.862
So, what do you think, Jon Chen ?

13:29.948 --> 13:32.477
Obviously, he has
a fetishistic slant

13:32.584 --> 13:33.650
towards all
things Asian.

13:33.735 --> 13:35.120
A mail order bride
would have been

13:35.206 --> 13:37.124
a thing to him,
like these weapons.

13:37.230 --> 13:39.767
What about the ritualistic
removal of the bones ?

13:39.895 --> 13:41.365
Could it be Minghun ?

13:41.624 --> 13:43.179
No. Definitely not.

13:43.435 --> 13:44.671
What's that, huh ?

13:44.799 --> 13:47.016
It's an ancient belief
in rural China

13:47.144 --> 13:49.361
that if a young,
unmarried male dies,

13:49.489 --> 13:50.405
his family
should rebury

13:50.548 --> 13:51.869
his bones with the bones
of a woman.

13:52.189 --> 13:53.724
A- A bride for the afterlife.

13:53.865 --> 13:54.939
Like a bury-age,

13:55.066 --> 13:55.940
or a marr-ial.

13:56.431 --> 13:57.198
A deading ?

14:01.684 --> 14:02.898
But I've
never heard

14:02.984 --> 14:05.904
of anyone committing murder
to get these bones.

14:06.055 --> 14:08.568
Well, then, we should pursue
this avenue of investigation.

14:08.717 --> 14:10.055
If you come across

14:10.231 --> 14:11.232
a Minghun

14:11.403 --> 14:14.278
in which the origin
of the bride's bones is unclear,

14:14.769 --> 14:15.728
you let us know.

14:19.841 --> 14:20.928
Of course.

14:25.872 --> 14:26.761
All right,
Sully, look,

14:26.874 --> 14:28.195
I want you to look into buying
one of these ancient

14:28.323 --> 14:31.137
Chinese weapons,
Leaping Donkey ?

14:31.371 --> 14:32.309
Flying Horse ?
Yeah.

14:32.415 --> 14:34.848
Whatever. See if Harper surfaces
long enough

14:34.997 --> 14:36.361
to, uh... to make the sale.

14:39.302 --> 14:40.368
Homeland Security says

14:40.517 --> 14:43.096
the Fiancé Visa was
expedited by a lawyer

14:43.261 --> 14:45.818
on a retainer, and to
a smaller bride agency

14:45.968 --> 14:47.609
here in town called
The Perfect Wife.

14:47.758 --> 14:49.079
That sounds archaic.

14:49.399 --> 14:50.672
Well, you know, in
therapy, I learned

14:50.799 --> 14:55.283
that, uh, superlatives like
"perfect" are, uh, meaningless.

14:55.446 --> 14:56.299
Not in science.

14:56.448 --> 14:58.792
A perfect number is a number
whose divisors add up to itself,

14:58.920 --> 15:00.945
as in, one plus two
plus three equals six.

15:01.382 --> 15:02.437
You know, in
therapy I learned

15:02.544 --> 15:05.592
that definitive statements are
by their very nature wrong.

15:05.728 --> 15:06.395
Isn't the statement,

15:06.405 --> 15:08.680
"Definitive statements
are by their very nature wrong"

15:08.808 --> 15:11.216
definitive,
and, thus, wrong ?

15:11.366 --> 15:12.687
You hate psychology.

15:12.879 --> 15:14.264
You haven't said anything
to change my mind.

15:14.350 --> 15:16.389
You know,
this is exactly why, okay,

15:16.475 --> 15:19.267
sometimes I-I do things like
shoot up an ice-cream truck.

15:19.395 --> 15:20.951
Well, it's a good thing
you had therapy.

15:23.913 --> 15:25.468
You know, we talked about you
in therapy.

15:28.410 --> 15:29.322
You did ?

15:31.841 --> 15:32.886
What did you say ?

15:33.184 --> 15:36.123
Well, you know,
since it was, uh, my therapy,

15:36.226 --> 15:38.314
I don't have
to share the details.

15:39.849 --> 15:40.872
Sorry.

15:42.663 --> 15:44.106
So you specialize

15:44.276 --> 15:46.728
in bringing brides
over from Russia,

15:46.898 --> 15:48.795
Romania, China
and Thailand ?

15:48.944 --> 15:50.586
I've had over 500 marriages

15:50.756 --> 15:51.758
since I opened shop.

15:52.269 --> 15:53.498
I match the happy couple

15:53.647 --> 15:55.182
using an empirical system

15:55.310 --> 15:56.759
of reciprocal attributes.

15:56.866 --> 15:57.867
You can't match

15:57.995 --> 15:59.317
humans empirically
because

15:59.465 --> 16:01.661
the variables number
in the tens of thousands.

16:01.832 --> 16:03.516
I never recommend a match

16:03.595 --> 16:06.366
with less than 200 points
of compatible commonality.

16:06.804 --> 16:10.160
Tens of thousands is
way more than 200.

16:10.395 --> 16:12.313
Yeah, this is great.
Were Drew Harper and Miss Fan...

16:12.398 --> 16:13.485
Miss Li.

16:13.656 --> 16:14.801
In Chinese nomenclature,

16:14.928 --> 16:15.760
the last name's first.

16:15.930 --> 16:17.678
And the first name is last.

16:18.254 --> 16:19.639
Great. Were they a good match ?

16:19.852 --> 16:21.920
Sadly, I'm sorry
to say, in the end, no.

16:22.325 --> 16:23.817
They decided not to marry.

16:23.976 --> 16:26.321
What-What happened
to Ms. Li after that ?

16:26.662 --> 16:29.412
On a Fianc\e Visa,
the couple has 90 days to marry,

16:29.558 --> 16:31.394
and if they don't,
the bride is required

16:31.595 --> 16:33.312
to return to her country
of origin,

16:33.504 --> 16:35.965
so, if Ling Fan is missing,

16:36.125 --> 16:37.833
it's probably because
she went back home.

16:38.068 --> 16:39.070
Ms. Fan is...

16:44.291 --> 16:46.252
Li Ling Fan is dead,

16:46.508 --> 16:47.552
Miss Burrows.

16:47.638 --> 16:48.639
She was beaten.

16:48.959 --> 16:50.622
Drew Harper may
have killed her.

16:50.899 --> 16:51.602
Did that possibility

16:51.687 --> 16:53.371
show up in your 200 points ?

16:56.949 --> 16:58.036
Um...

16:59.377 --> 17:01.660
This is my background check
on Drew Harper.

17:01.788 --> 17:04.516
You'll find that my screening
process exceeds the minimums

17:04.601 --> 17:06.068
set by the Marriage Broker Act.

17:07.517 --> 17:09.095
Thank you, Ms. Burrows.
You-You can leave.

17:18.220 --> 17:21.055
Well, Harper provided
a completely false background.

17:21.523 --> 17:22.377
Is that possible ?

17:22.483 --> 17:23.847
Well, career criminal, fence.

17:23.997 --> 17:25.147
I mean, yeah,
he could bring himself

17:25.297 --> 17:27.079
a whole identity
based on false documents.

17:27.230 --> 17:30.299
This is definitely
not a match made in heaven.

17:31.940 --> 17:34.878
I've bn worming my way
into observing this ceremony

17:35.006 --> 17:37.585
firsthand for two months
through the groom's family.

17:37.777 --> 17:39.227
That would be the dead groom ?
Yes.

17:39.397 --> 17:41.230
Overtures are always made
by the groom's family.

17:41.358 --> 17:45.185
Now, I hear they will pay
$25,000 dollars for a bride.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.777
- That would be the dead bride ?
- Booth...

17:46.896 --> 17:48.419
you're being very judgmental.

17:49.293 --> 17:50.465
I apologize.

17:50.998 --> 17:51.658
I just

17:51.850 --> 17:52.618
think it's a little...

17:53.555 --> 17:54.557
Apparently,

17:54.685 --> 17:55.623
they've found a bride.

17:55.730 --> 17:57.322
Well, who is she, or was she ?

17:57.450 --> 17:58.836
You know, because she's dead.

17:59.240 --> 18:01.585
My sources don't know anything
about the bride.

18:01.820 --> 18:03.695
Who got the $25,000 ?

18:03.887 --> 18:05.123
Most likely the bride's family.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.253
Most likely ?

18:06.731 --> 18:07.802
My understanding

18:07.930 --> 18:11.020
is that before the Minghun,
the bones are spread

18:11.170 --> 18:12.470
throughout the family members,

18:12.725 --> 18:15.454
and then brought together
for the reburial ceremony ?

18:15.518 --> 18:16.562
- That's correct.
- If you could get

18:16.688 --> 18:17.687
me a sample of one

18:17.794 --> 18:19.734
of the bones,
we could check the DNA,

18:19.840 --> 18:21.098
see if it's Li Ling Fan.

18:21.204 --> 18:23.059
Do you know where
any of these bones are, Professor Shi ?

18:27.705 --> 18:31.377
I might know where
maybe one bone is being kept.

18:31.618 --> 18:32.827
If you could get me to a place

18:32.909 --> 18:34.170
where I could just look

18:34.276 --> 18:35.491
at the bone,
your subjects

18:35.576 --> 18:36.898
will never know I was there.

18:41.485 --> 18:42.487
All right,

18:42.593 --> 18:44.426
but you'll have
to pretend to be

18:44.788 --> 18:45.790
my girlfriend...

18:48.519 --> 18:49.520
and her brother.

18:51.542 --> 18:52.672
Yeah, right.

18:59.023 --> 18:59.978
What did she say ?

19:00.085 --> 19:01.875
Just hospitality stuff.

19:10.709 --> 19:12.691
I don't need to
speak Chinese to get that.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.439
She don't think
Bones is good for you.

19:14.908 --> 19:16.080
You just made that up.

19:16.741 --> 19:18.126
Nail on the head.

19:18.446 --> 19:19.448
Ha !

19:37.327 --> 19:39.181
She said your face
has character.

19:39.309 --> 19:41.973
Yeah, well, all the, uh, older
ladies, they-they like me.

19:42.777 --> 19:44.333
Bones, what are you
doing, Bones ? Bones ?

19:45.974 --> 19:48.063
The... These are traditional
storage pots.

19:48.286 --> 19:49.522
Please, Dr. Brennan,
whatever you find,

19:49.650 --> 19:50.865
you promised not
to disturb it.

19:50.951 --> 19:53.040
No, I promised not
to disrupt your study. Ooh !

19:54.248 --> 19:56.124
Whoa, what is it ?
Is that human ?

19:56.380 --> 19:58.213
Yeah, it's an ilium
part of the hip bone.

19:58.980 --> 20:00.131
What am I supposed
to do with this ?

20:00.195 --> 20:01.960
Dr. Brennan, quickly,
put it back !

20:16.787 --> 20:18.321
Did Bones just speak Chinese ?

20:22.497 --> 20:23.605
Definitely human.

20:24.138 --> 20:25.715
No sign of any cut marks.

20:25.864 --> 20:27.548
- Well, is it Li Ling Fan ?
- No.

20:27.633 --> 20:28.635
It's male.

20:29.019 --> 20:30.106
So, what, you got a...

20:30.212 --> 20:31.890
part of the groom instead
of a piece of the bride ?

20:32.145 --> 20:32.998
Bones stole it.

20:33.147 --> 20:35.406
Not stole, swapped.

20:35.492 --> 20:36.962
From an old Chinese lady's
mantle.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.533
I brought
a bunch of

20:38.640 --> 20:42.540
chimpanzee bones and pulled
the old, uh, switchamacallit.

20:42.732 --> 20:43.819
Switcharoo.

20:43.968 --> 20:45.013
Whatchamacallit.

20:45.119 --> 20:45.817
Two different things.

20:45.881 --> 20:47.010
These anomalies--

20:47.160 --> 20:49.270
whoever this was died of cancer.

20:49.376 --> 20:50.591
I'll get Zack
to find the details,

20:50.698 --> 20:52.616
but this is definitely not
Li Ling Fan.

20:52.744 --> 20:54.492
Maybe it's the groom.
Makes sense.

20:54.875 --> 20:58.451
Especially if this is a
dead people bone marriage thing.

20:59.645 --> 21:00.945
Uh, Temperance ?

21:01.521 --> 21:02.501
Hey.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.185
Um, you got a sec ?

21:07.942 --> 21:08.944
Excuse me.

21:09.711 --> 21:10.926
You bought the boat.

21:11.501 --> 21:12.844
Finalized this morning.

21:14.485 --> 21:17.102
Wait, sailboats
have keys ?

21:18.507 --> 21:20.511
Uh, no,
not-not really.

21:20.638 --> 21:23.750
These are keys to the marina,
but, you know, it's symbolic.

21:24.954 --> 21:26.126
Congratulations.

21:28.577 --> 21:30.623
So, I'm gonna tell you
something, and I-I want you

21:30.751 --> 21:32.745
to think about it a while
before you answer.

21:34.088 --> 21:34.877
Okay.

21:34.962 --> 21:36.049
Well, you say ok,

21:36.177 --> 21:39.395
but it takes you microseconds
to think things through, so...

21:40.184 --> 21:41.953
this time,
I'd-I'd appreciate it

21:42.090 --> 21:44.115
if you, uh, just
took a breath,

21:44.243 --> 21:45.245
because...

21:46.119 --> 21:47.461
it's... it's big.

21:51.213 --> 21:52.683
what is it ?

21:54.990 --> 21:56.248
I'm headed south

21:56.418 --> 21:58.145
in the boat to the Caribbean.

21:59.828 --> 22:00.830
When ?

22:01.534 --> 22:02.770
When this case is done.

22:04.672 --> 22:05.866
You quit the FBI ?

22:05.951 --> 22:07.230
No. No, not yet.

22:07.486 --> 22:10.805
I'll take a couple of months
to get used to the boat...

22:10.896 --> 22:11.721
you know, really check it out...

22:11.828 --> 22:14.279
and then I'll start
running charters, probably

22:14.407 --> 22:16.432
- for the Turks and Caicos, which is...
- You're...

22:16.794 --> 22:18.393
You're really talking a lot.

22:18.904 --> 22:19.906
I know.

22:20.354 --> 22:22.523
And I haven't even gotten
to the main part.

22:25.465 --> 22:26.786
Which is, uh...

22:28.917 --> 22:29.919
I really...

22:31.177 --> 22:32.861
really want you to come with me.

22:37.659 --> 22:38.788
You do ?

22:39.918 --> 22:41.005
I do.

22:43.946 --> 22:45.383
Take a sabbatical.

22:46.278 --> 22:48.538
There's more to life
than corpses

22:48.644 --> 22:49.262
and murders.

22:49.369 --> 22:52.012
You know, we do this job
for too long, we get warped.

22:52.694 --> 22:54.542
I can feel it
happening already.

22:54.649 --> 22:56.183
- Maybe you can, too.
- Let...

22:57.270 --> 22:58.720
Let's run away together.

23:03.350 --> 23:05.034
Well, you know,
think about it.

23:07.443 --> 23:08.423
Want a hug ?

23:08.977 --> 23:09.937
Okay. No.

23:10.469 --> 23:11.066
That's...

23:11.770 --> 23:13.667
That's a lot to process.

23:13.795 --> 23:15.220
So, just, you know,
I don't know,

23:15.625 --> 23:18.012
you know, let me know
when you think that maybe...

23:18.886 --> 23:19.888
Okay.

23:38.822 --> 23:42.189
Stage Three Sarcoma,
M-1 Metastasis.

23:42.573 --> 23:44.534
Like Brennan said: Cancer.

23:44.832 --> 23:46.978
Yes, most likely,
it spread from

23:47.085 --> 23:48.939
prostate or testicular cancer.

23:49.322 --> 23:50.708
So it's definitely a guy.

23:50.836 --> 23:52.904
If this is the groom,
then he's Chinese,

23:53.053 --> 23:54.545
and, according
to Dr. Shi,

23:54.652 --> 23:56.246
most likely related in some way

23:56.395 --> 23:59.571
to the old lady
who kept him in a pot.

23:59.614 --> 24:01.276
Which should be enough
to identify him

24:01.354 --> 24:02.299
through hospital records.

24:03.386 --> 24:05.006
None of Harper's weapons show

24:05.113 --> 24:07.393
any sign of being used
to dissect a human being.

24:07.564 --> 24:08.438
No protein residue,

24:08.544 --> 24:09.738
even under ALS.

24:10.100 --> 24:11.166
Is there any way to tell

24:11.272 --> 24:13.127
what kind of blade
was used on the skin ?

24:13.212 --> 24:14.938
Only that it was sharp
and straight-edged.

24:15.024 --> 24:16.339
But I did find
evidence of

24:16.424 --> 24:17.916
toxicity damage to the kidney.

24:18.193 --> 24:19.749
Wait, the victim was poisoned ?

24:20.410 --> 24:22.222
I thought she was
beaten to death.

24:22.499 --> 24:24.801
Well, the bruising could've been
a result of Fong's Disease.

24:25.163 --> 24:26.820
Toxicology
identified the toxin

24:26.948 --> 24:28.760
as a root called Lei Gong Teng.

24:29.293 --> 24:31.147
In small doses,
it's an anti-inflammatory.

24:31.254 --> 24:33.357
In large, it has another name.

24:33.747 --> 24:35.047
Loosely
translates as

24:35.169 --> 24:36.746
"Walk seven steps and die."

24:38.003 --> 24:39.900
I'll have Booth check out
Chinese herbalists.

24:43.374 --> 24:44.717
Want me to bring you up to date ?

24:45.078 --> 24:45.996
No.

24:47.850 --> 24:49.342
I want you to tell me
what to do.

24:49.811 --> 24:50.856
About what ?

24:52.153 --> 24:53.816
Sully wants me
to run off with him.

24:54.221 --> 24:55.969
- Go.
- For a year.

24:56.203 --> 24:57.823
- Go.
- He wants to run a charter boat

24:57.908 --> 24:58.974
around the Caribbean.

24:59.336 --> 24:59.891
Go.

24:59.997 --> 25:01.830
He says I should
take a sabbatical.

25:01.894 --> 25:02.555
Go.

25:03.261 --> 25:04.710
What is the downside ?

25:05.158 --> 25:06.436
He's a great guy.

25:06.543 --> 25:07.886
This is a
great idea.

25:08.419 --> 25:09.655
I'd miss you guys.

25:09.761 --> 25:11.914
Oh, we'll meet you in Barbados.

25:12.426 --> 25:14.960
Look, you have been working
every day since I met you.

25:15.088 --> 25:17.646
It's time to let another part
of yourself out into the sun,

25:17.902 --> 25:21.269
with a bare-chested man
in a tropical breeze.

25:23.060 --> 25:23.955
William Chang.

25:24.083 --> 25:27.111
Single, age 27,
died two years ago

25:27.218 --> 25:29.498
of metastasizing
prostate cancer.

25:29.605 --> 25:31.438
Great nephew
of Mei Zhang.

25:31.630 --> 25:32.887
He looks nice.

25:33.250 --> 25:34.891
Booth will want
to talk to his parents,

25:34.975 --> 25:36.787
try to find out where
they got the female bones,

25:36.894 --> 25:38.236
in case it's Li Ling Fan.

25:38.343 --> 25:39.878
Listen to
me, Brennan.

25:40.560 --> 25:41.561
Go.

25:44.332 --> 25:47.171
There'll still be
murder and mayhem

25:47.256 --> 25:48.258
when you get back.

25:54.588 --> 25:56.677
They're going to know this
information came from me.

25:57.259 --> 25:58.772
You've ruined my study.

25:58.900 --> 26:00.435
They won't know for sure it was you.

26:00.712 --> 26:03.205
Their son's bones are
spread all over the city.

26:03.291 --> 26:06.125
They let me in on something very
precious to them and now this.

26:06.701 --> 26:08.016
I broke the
first rule

26:08.101 --> 26:10.894
of anthropology: minimize
the effect on the study.

26:11.043 --> 26:12.748
Do you really believe
that your study

26:12.833 --> 26:15.050
is more important
than catching a murder ?

26:17.085 --> 26:17.660
You used to be

26:17.746 --> 26:20.538
dedicated to a much larger,
timeless truth.

26:21.915 --> 26:25.517
Now, you're just a tool for those
who have smaller concerns.

26:39.100 --> 26:42.680
So you buried your son William
three years ago.

26:46.197 --> 26:47.838
My condolences.

26:51.141 --> 26:52.797
We have come into possession

26:52.904 --> 26:55.014
of one of his bones.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.765
You have no idea
how this happened ?

27:01.515 --> 27:05.030
Maybe you're planning on
reburying your son

27:05.115 --> 27:06.565
with the bones of a young woman

27:06.885 --> 27:08.078
to provide him

27:08.163 --> 27:09.911
loving company in the afterlife ?

27:14.412 --> 27:15.243
You see, we need to know

27:15.375 --> 27:17.144
who this woman is,
because it's possible

27:17.311 --> 27:18.547
that she's a murder victim.

27:21.297 --> 27:23.407
You wouldn't want that,
would you ?

27:30.533 --> 27:31.791
Okay. Well, you give me
no choice

27:31.876 --> 27:33.347
but to get an order
of exhumation.

27:37.222 --> 27:38.373
Sully bought that boat.

27:38.906 --> 27:39.546
Yeah ?

27:40.143 --> 27:40.867
Next thing you know,

27:40.974 --> 27:43.958
he'll be shipwrecked on some
island talking to a volleyball.

27:44.299 --> 27:45.748
He's leaving for
the Caribbean.

27:49.552 --> 27:50.320
Really.

27:51.407 --> 27:54.561
Look, I'm... I'm sorry, Bones.

27:55.499 --> 27:56.181
I know that
the two of you

27:56.288 --> 27:58.328
were kind of
hitting it off, and...

27:58.392 --> 27:59.671
He wants me to go with him.

28:01.568 --> 28:02.676
Oh.

28:04.317 --> 28:05.653
Oh. Yeah, yeah.

28:06.570 --> 28:09.106
He says I should take
a year off, a sabbatical.

28:09.170 --> 28:10.534
He says it would be fun.
Yeah, it would be.

28:11.877 --> 28:14.392
You just said he'd be
shipwrecked with a volleyball.

28:14.520 --> 28:16.246
No, he's got you,
he doesn't need the volleyball.

28:19.592 --> 28:20.913
You think I should go ?

28:25.586 --> 28:26.566
Yeah.

28:26.907 --> 28:27.742
Yeah.

28:27.867 --> 28:30.403
You know, what's one year
out of your life, huh ?

28:30.851 --> 28:33.387
A person's got to live wide.

28:36.110 --> 28:37.261
This is kind of narrow.

28:40.671 --> 28:41.396
Whoa.

28:42.483 --> 28:43.421
That the coffin already ?

28:43.719 --> 28:44.657
Can't be.

28:44.913 --> 28:45.851
We're only
two feet down.

28:45.914 --> 28:47.193
Oh, easy ! Careful !

28:51.146 --> 28:52.254
Is it fake money ?

28:56.453 --> 28:58.265
There's no body in this coffin.

29:00.515 --> 29:02.796
There was a body in here,
but it was removed.

29:03.627 --> 29:04.906
What's with the fake money ?

29:05.162 --> 29:06.420
Chinese tradition.

29:06.803 --> 29:09.035
Send a loved one off to
the afterlife well-funded,

29:09.163 --> 29:10.782
at least symbolically.

29:10.932 --> 29:12.701
How long ago was
the body removed ?

29:12.807 --> 29:15.685
This little darling is
Phaenicia sericata,

29:16.090 --> 29:18.177
also known as
the common green bottle fly.

29:18.305 --> 29:20.905
Now, William Chang was buried
in January, three years ago.

29:21.182 --> 29:22.248
Since the green bottle fly

29:22.376 --> 29:24.870
is only active in the summer
months, I contend he was dug up

29:24.998 --> 29:26.532
last July or August,

29:26.660 --> 29:28.131
which allowed
maggots to be laid

29:28.252 --> 29:29.701
in the casket to feast on.

29:29.787 --> 29:30.959
Okay, yeah, I got it.

29:31.321 --> 29:32.643
I can be a lot more specific.

29:32.728 --> 29:33.559
No, no, you know...

29:33.666 --> 29:35.648
dug up last summer and
distributed to the family...

29:35.755 --> 29:37.481
specific enough for the FBI.

29:37.844 --> 29:39.312
He would've
decomposed quickly.

29:39.717 --> 29:41.060
Buried in a pine box,

29:41.145 --> 29:43.639
improperly sealed,
buried only two feet

29:43.724 --> 29:44.662
below the surface.

29:45.536 --> 29:47.134
The Changs should
sue their mortuary.

29:47.433 --> 29:48.648
Because of the
shallow burial ?

29:48.733 --> 29:50.145
Yeah, and the decomp seepage

29:50.252 --> 29:52.596
into the fake money is,
um, au naturel.

29:53.492 --> 29:54.536
What does that mean ?

29:54.728 --> 29:56.348
The body was not embalmed.

29:56.497 --> 29:58.543
All right, none of this is
helping us solve the mystery

29:58.692 --> 30:00.439
of what happened to Li Ling Fan.

30:01.099 --> 30:02.570
The funeral home is in on it.

30:02.826 --> 30:04.488
They wanted the
body to decompose

30:04.595 --> 30:05.980
as quickly as possible.

30:06.215 --> 30:07.472
Full service mortuary.

30:07.771 --> 30:10.435
They perform funerals
and weddings for dead people.

30:14.248 --> 30:16.443
Mortuary records show
that we buried William Chang

30:16.635 --> 30:17.743
in a lead-lined
casket.

30:17.850 --> 30:19.214
If you found
another casket...

30:19.363 --> 30:21.047
Pine box.
It was a pine box.

30:21.132 --> 30:24.541
It is obvious that Mr. Chang
was dug up and reburied.

30:24.733 --> 30:26.012
Who embalmed William Chang ?

30:26.204 --> 30:27.482
The records show that

30:27.610 --> 30:30.275
my grandson and I had 
that honor.

30:30.488 --> 30:31.191
You're lying.

30:31.255 --> 30:32.768
William Chang was
never embalmed.

30:33.287 --> 30:34.020
said there was nothing

30:33.834 --> 30:34.857
But you yourself

30:34.942 --> 30:37.287
but fake money in the casket.

30:37.500 --> 30:38.374
So how can you tell ?

30:38.481 --> 30:39.717
We can tell
from the residue

30:39.802 --> 30:40.910
left in the empty casket.

30:45.306 --> 30:46.734
I'm sorry, but we cannot help you.

30:46.819 --> 30:48.439
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Mr. Han,

30:48.609 --> 30:49.462
please, just...

30:49.846 --> 30:51.849
sit down... please ?
Just...

30:52.744 --> 30:54.907
Here's what I think, okay ?
I think that you have

30:54.949 --> 30:57.869
some old Chinese
traditions alive

30:57.997 --> 31:00.278
which are illegal
in this country.

31:00.363 --> 31:02.217
The Minghun reburial ceremony.

31:02.494 --> 31:03.447
...I'm not
concerned about.

31:03.532 --> 31:06.409
What I care about is
if the bride was murdered.

31:07.219 --> 31:07.944
Murdered ?

31:08.051 --> 31:09.969
Our understanding is
that Mr. Chang's family

31:10.097 --> 31:12.633
paid $25,000 for her bones.

31:12.697 --> 31:13.976
People have killed
for much less,

31:14.061 --> 31:18.218
so what part of that
25 grand came to you ?

31:19.113 --> 31:20.712
Did the Changs admit
to paying that money ?

31:21.053 --> 31:21.735
No.

31:21.927 --> 31:24.612
We found a cash withdrawal
that they can't explain.

31:24.975 --> 31:26.520
But you are
not even certain that

31:26.828 --> 31:30.292
William Chang's Minghun bride
is this murdered woman ?

31:31.038 --> 31:31.635
No, sir.

31:31.784 --> 31:33.340
But we can't know
for sure it isn't her

31:33.447 --> 31:34.662
without looking at the bones.

31:34.747 --> 31:37.266
If the bride were not
this murdered woman,

31:37.398 --> 31:39.891
would you allow
the ceremony to proceed ?

31:40.019 --> 31:40.744
Grandfather...

31:45.279 --> 31:46.281
What ceremony ?

32:01.816 --> 32:03.181
We're very sorry to disturb you.

32:03.504 --> 32:04.225
FBI.

32:04.396 --> 32:05.504
I need to see the coffin.

32:07.241 --> 32:07.902
Sorry.

32:08.946 --> 32:10.837
Take a look, Bones.
Take a look.

32:10.943 --> 32:11.647
Okay.

32:12.904 --> 32:14.098
Indications of cancer.

32:14.247 --> 32:15.845
I believe this is William Chang.

32:16.549 --> 32:19.165
Here's the chimpanzee
ilium that I left.

32:19.292 --> 32:20.188
What about the girl ?

32:23.598 --> 32:25.836
Lots of score marks
on the bones

32:25.879 --> 32:27.541
congruent with flesh
being removed

32:27.598 --> 32:29.261
from the skeleton
with blades.

32:30.092 --> 32:31.733
I believe this is
Li Ling Fan.

32:34.184 --> 32:35.314
Where is everybody ?

32:36.231 --> 32:38.186
Well, I guess we really
broke up the party.

32:45.876 --> 32:48.005
Positive I. D. on both
sets of remains:

32:48.155 --> 32:49.945
William Chang
and Li Ling Fan.

32:50.222 --> 32:51.586
Wow, they kind of go together.

32:51.714 --> 32:53.042
Because they're deceased ?

32:53.291 --> 32:54.528
Yeah, but more than that,

32:54.719 --> 32:57.192
they're exactly the same
level of hotness.

32:57.299 --> 32:59.364
Which is zero,
because they're skeletons.

32:59.555 --> 33:00.484
The cuts left on

33:00.621 --> 33:03.243
the skeletal structure by
the removal of soft tissue

33:03.371 --> 33:04.863
match the
implements the FBI

33:05.033 --> 33:06.720
confiscated from the mortuary.

33:06.845 --> 33:07.717
She was ill,

33:07.867 --> 33:09.252
and he was ill.

33:09.423 --> 33:11.852
It's really too bad
they never actually met.

33:12.585 --> 33:15.114
The mortician's lawyer
advised him to clam up.

33:15.582 --> 33:17.032
The Changs now say

33:17.138 --> 33:19.899
the $25,000 was used
to pay off a family debt.

33:20.048 --> 33:20.560
You ever think that

33:20.667 --> 33:22.393
their spirits actually did meet

33:22.478 --> 33:25.889
and are working to get
their bones together here

33:25.974 --> 33:26.848
on the physical plane ?

33:26.976 --> 33:29.683
You mean, like we're possessed
and doing their bidding ?

33:31.565 --> 33:32.965
You know what you people lack ?

33:33.590 --> 33:34.591
Whimsy.

33:35.337 --> 33:36.702
It's a genuine handicap.

33:40.005 --> 33:42.195
There are four morticians
working at that mortuary

33:42.387 --> 33:43.559
and a half a dozen assistants.

33:43.678 --> 33:45.179
Then any one of them
could have removed the bones

33:45.302 --> 33:46.522
and sank the skin in the river.

33:46.757 --> 33:47.758
Personally, I would
have cremated

33:47.886 --> 33:49.123
the remaing skins
and organs.

33:49.272 --> 33:50.940
No crematorium
at that mortuary.

33:51.382 --> 33:53.663
I am gonna draw them
a wedding picture.

33:54.644 --> 33:55.453
Okay.

33:56.008 --> 33:57.977
Well, you do that, we...

33:58.416 --> 34:00.377
should find out
who poisoned the victim

34:00.484 --> 34:02.018
and arrest him for murder.

34:02.947 --> 34:04.209
It's probably the, uh,

34:04.337 --> 34:06.511
bouncing flying
mail order husband.

34:08.898 --> 34:10.007
Does that count
as whimsy ?

34:10.454 --> 34:11.887
Well, you're
handicapped, Zack.

34:12.373 --> 34:14.782
Someone really needs
to throw a telethon for you.

34:18.489 --> 34:20.409
How did Sully find Harper
so quickly ?

34:20.600 --> 34:21.645
He didn't say.

34:22.092 --> 34:23.690
You know, Sully's
a nice guy.

34:24.495 --> 34:25.646
You sound condescending.

34:26.456 --> 34:28.161
I'm just trying
to be nice, okay.

34:28.268 --> 34:30.206
I'm complimenting the fact that
you got a good one this time.

34:30.505 --> 34:33.511
Thereby implying I'm incapable
of making my own judgments.

34:34.447 --> 34:36.743
The physicist
who couldn't tie his shoes...

34:37.360 --> 34:38.320
Oh, the former professor

34:38.405 --> 34:41.047
who was, uh, jealous of your
own success... should I stop ?

34:41.134 --> 34:42.647
- Yes.
- Oh, the guy

34:42.775 --> 34:43.905
that you found
on the Internet

34:44.054 --> 34:45.731
ended up being some kind
of recruiter for a cult.

34:45.817 --> 34:47.650
Oh, and this is my favorite:

34:47.927 --> 34:49.440
the guy who cut off
his own brother's head

34:49.547 --> 34:51.380
because he thought he was
possessed by a witch.

34:51.456 --> 34:52.531
Yeah, you made your point.

34:52.829 --> 34:53.980
Look, I'm just
saying a guy

34:54.257 --> 34:57.409
who wants to take you away
from all this on a sailboat,

34:57.643 --> 34:58.645
that's a step up.

34:58.688 --> 34:59.945
Condescending.

35:07.097 --> 35:07.907
That's our guy.

35:08.248 --> 35:09.314
Okay, so when do
we take him off ?

35:09.506 --> 35:10.507
Down.

35:10.998 --> 35:13.065
We take him down
when Sully puts his cap

35:13.172 --> 35:14.323
in his back pocket.

35:20.213 --> 35:21.214
Freeze !

35:22.834 --> 35:23.836
Freeze !

35:25.066 --> 35:26.536
Geez, I told you
he was fast.

35:27.282 --> 35:28.497
- Are you okay ?
- Yeah.

35:29.435 --> 35:30.266
Okay, great, fine.
Sully,

35:30.344 --> 35:31.950
you chase him,
I'll head him off, okay ?

35:32.398 --> 35:33.810
Okay, okay,
okay, okay.

35:40.610 --> 35:41.903
- Have you thought about my offer ?
- Yes.

35:42.180 --> 35:44.717
- What do you think ?
- This is not the time to discuss it.

35:53.056 --> 35:54.122
The guy must be
on meth !

35:54.250 --> 35:55.252
Martial arts.

35:57.319 --> 35:59.536
FBI. Freeze right there.

35:59.780 --> 36:00.889
I said freeze !

36:01.272 --> 36:02.274
Freeze !

36:02.497 --> 36:03.499
Damn it !

36:11.703 --> 36:13.174
What, is he on wires ?

36:23.642 --> 36:25.731
He ain't bouncing around
any more now, is he ?

36:27.902 --> 36:28.968
See that ?

36:30.737 --> 36:32.293
I did not kill Ling Fan.

36:32.826 --> 36:34.128
Then why'd you keep
running away, huh ?

36:34.297 --> 36:35.000
I'm a criminal !

36:35.085 --> 36:35.938
You're police.

36:36.044 --> 36:37.451
Ling Fan didn't really
know anyone.

36:37.558 --> 36:38.829
That makes you a good suspect.

36:38.922 --> 36:40.712
Sell her bones for $25,000.

36:40.797 --> 36:41.884
Make up for the loss.

36:42.012 --> 36:42.630
What loss ?

36:42.737 --> 36:44.378
You paid $25,000

36:44.463 --> 36:46.915
to the Perfect Wife agency
to bring her over;

36:47.106 --> 36:49.626
probably another eight grand
for the round-trip ticket.

36:49.967 --> 36:51.246
That's a lot of knife sales.

36:51.395 --> 36:52.973
You people got it
completely wrong.

36:53.420 --> 36:55.530
Chick doesn't work out,
you get a full refund

36:55.871 --> 36:56.873
or a swap.

36:57.257 --> 36:58.743
I took the money-back guarantee.

36:59.020 --> 37:00.021
Really ?

37:00.107 --> 37:02.089
- Oops.
- I didn't lose a cent.

37:02.153 --> 37:04.370
It's the mail order agency
that's out all that dough.

37:05.877 --> 37:07.028
What was wrong with her ?

37:07.454 --> 37:08.221
What ?!

37:08.306 --> 37:09.820
Why did you send Ling Fan back ?

37:10.971 --> 37:12.335
Chick was defective, man.

37:13.401 --> 37:15.020
I'm a very active person.

37:15.191 --> 37:16.257
She moved slow,

37:16.342 --> 37:17.361
like an old lady.

37:21.794 --> 37:23.094
You hit me
with the Flying Horse ?

37:23.243 --> 37:23.584
Yeah.

37:23.712 --> 37:25.183
That is a very
good item.

37:26.455 --> 37:27.606
Maybe you still want to buy it ?

37:28.139 --> 37:29.119
I'm gonna need bail money.

37:36.658 --> 37:38.555
So, you wanna know
what your first mistake was ?

37:39.471 --> 37:41.453
Thinking you wouldn't find out
about the refund ?

37:41.517 --> 37:42.583
No, your first mistake

37:42.732 --> 37:43.905
was killing Ling Fan.

37:43.990 --> 37:44.921
And your second mistake was

37:44.985 --> 37:46.627
keeping the poison
that you used

37:46.776 --> 37:47.927
in your refrigerator.

37:48.204 --> 37:50.484
Third mistake was thinking
that, once we had you,

37:50.570 --> 37:53.895
that the grandson
at the mortuary, Nelson Han,

37:54.689 --> 37:55.691
that he wouldn't
cooperate.

37:55.840 --> 37:56.842
I mean, not only
did he follow...

37:58.312 --> 38:01.616
You know, Booth, uh...
is a really good guy.

38:02.064 --> 38:03.364
He says the same about you.

38:03.726 --> 38:04.728
Really ?

38:05.304 --> 38:07.329
'Cause I figured
he was the one talking you out

38:07.435 --> 38:08.629
of going with me.

38:09.972 --> 38:11.187
No, he told me to go.

38:11.677 --> 38:12.977
Angela did, too.

38:14.831 --> 38:16.432
Everyone thinks
it's a great idea.

38:17.766 --> 38:19.109
Everyone except you ?

38:24.480 --> 38:25.864
But you're not gonna go,
are you ?

38:33.686 --> 38:34.901
Why, Brennan ?

38:36.447 --> 38:37.832
Sailing around
warm oceans

38:37.982 --> 38:39.260
with someone who loves you.

38:40.880 --> 38:41.882
Please,

38:42.117 --> 38:43.886
tell me
what is holding you here.

38:49.360 --> 38:50.511
Look, I don't...

38:51.363 --> 38:53.218
I don't wanna sound conceited...

38:54.923 --> 38:55.839
but, uh...

38:57.240 --> 38:58.604
I think
I'm worth the risk.

38:59.478 --> 39:00.544
You are.

39:03.229 --> 39:04.402
You definitely are.

39:07.200 --> 39:09.161
All right, well,
you're the logical one.

39:10.621 --> 39:11.676
What's your thinking ?

39:14.713 --> 39:15.790
Rationally...

39:20.357 --> 39:22.190
...rationally thinking, I...

39:24.598 --> 39:25.898
I want to go.

39:26.894 --> 39:29.237
And I know I should go,
but...

39:34.800 --> 39:35.954
...I can't.

39:44.479 --> 39:45.545
What you're doing...

39:47.783 --> 39:48.593
it's important...

39:52.170 --> 39:55.260
... but it's not important enough
to be your whole life.

42:16.790 --> 42:18.026
What are you doing here ?

42:18.730 --> 42:20.748
I'm waving goodbye...
see ?

42:23.200 --> 42:24.372
What do you want ?

42:24.883 --> 42:26.013
Breakfast.

42:26.525 --> 42:27.441
I'm not hungry.

42:27.633 --> 42:29.388
Aw, come on, huh ?

42:29.708 --> 42:30.561
What are you gonna vomit

42:30.667 --> 42:33.076
when we come across one of
those, uh, horrific cases ?

42:33.182 --> 42:34.205
I don't vomit.

42:35.060 --> 42:36.550
Give it time,
Bones, okay ?

42:36.742 --> 42:37.701
Give it time.

42:38.660 --> 42:40.696
Everything happens
eventually.

42:41.124 --> 42:41.891
Everything ?

42:42.126 --> 42:45.877
All the stuff you
think never happens,

42:46.815 --> 42:47.838
it happens.

42:48.946 --> 42:50.396
You just gotta
be ready for it.
