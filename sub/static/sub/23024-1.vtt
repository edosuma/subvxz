WEBVTT

01:47.775 --> 01:54.907
THE UNTAMED

03:11.483 --> 03:13.319
That's enough, Verónica.

03:13.485 --> 03:15.821
It's time for you to leave.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.160
Let me stay a little longer.

03:21.493 --> 03:22.536
Please.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.684
It hurt her.

07:05.717 --> 07:07.511
Feels so good, Ale.

08:00.647 --> 08:03.609
Mum, Jacobo found the chocolate bars!

08:03.817 --> 08:06.820
And he's getting his allergy again!

08:24.463 --> 08:26.089
How do you feel?

08:26.298 --> 08:27.466
It hurts.

08:28.217 --> 08:31.386
It's normal. It's a deep wound.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.806
You think
the dog might have rabies?

08:35.849 --> 08:37.433
Excuse me?

08:37.808 --> 08:40.812
Could the dog
you told me about have rabies?

08:46.026 --> 08:48.111
I don't know...
I don't think so.

08:48.237 --> 08:50.989
It's important because
if you're not sure there are two options:

08:51.823 --> 08:53.116
We either go look for the dog
or put you...

08:53.242 --> 08:55.452
on a preventive treatment.

08:55.619 --> 08:59.373
You'd have to come in weekly
and get injections in your stomach.

09:00.249 --> 09:02.334
They are painful injections.

09:17.724 --> 09:20.519
Do you know where to find the dog
that bit you?

09:26.650 --> 09:29.403
Then we must go
and look for that dog.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.196
You're okay with that?

09:34.157 --> 09:36.910
Let's see if we can go tomorrow?

09:46.044 --> 09:48.046
You're gonna hurt yourself.

09:49.506 --> 09:51.091
Good morning!

09:52.593 --> 09:54.303
Let me see that rash.

09:55.887 --> 09:58.473
I told you not to bring
those chocolates here.

09:59.182 --> 10:00.767
Your mum gave them to me.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.937
She should have taken them
directly to the party.

10:04.688 --> 10:06.440
Why did you leave them out?

10:06.607 --> 10:07.899
I hid them!

10:08.692 --> 10:11.320
Jacobo knows perfectly well
that he's allergic. Right?

10:12.738 --> 10:14.740
Stop scratching and eat!

10:14.906 --> 10:16.950
Can you take him to the hospital?

10:17.909 --> 10:19.745
Just take him to your brother.

10:20.537 --> 10:22.456
Okay, then take lván to pre-school.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.751
Be careful, lván!

10:27.711 --> 10:30.005
Can you take him to pre-school?

10:30.213 --> 10:32.424
You can take him after the hospital.
I'm already running late.

10:32.591 --> 10:34.468
I could actually get fired.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.931
Don't play with that, eat it!

10:41.808 --> 10:43.560
I can't breathe.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.646
Don't be a clown!

10:49.941 --> 10:52.861
When something like this happens,
don't go to the ER.

10:53.028 --> 10:55.530
Come look for me in the other building,
it's quicker to get you through.

10:55.614 --> 10:56.490
Yes.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.955
- One moment.
- I have big cheeks, uncle.

11:04.122 --> 11:06.124
- Was the chocolate good at least?
- Yes.

11:06.750 --> 11:09.795
That's good, because the doctor
is going to have to give you a shot.

11:10.253 --> 11:11.755
I don't wanna!

11:12.464 --> 11:13.757
Is everything all right, sis?

11:13.882 --> 11:15.133
Yes.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.886
- Come in.
- Thanks, Rosi.

11:20.472 --> 11:23.433
- Let me see your little worm!
- Ask your sister, dude!

11:31.191 --> 11:33.151
Let me see that worm!

11:45.747 --> 11:48.333
Watch out! The boss is coming!

11:56.258 --> 11:57.843
Dude, cut it out!

11:58.427 --> 12:00.637
It's payback, asshole!

12:01.847 --> 12:06.768
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, they fight like school girls!

12:07.352 --> 12:11.398
Let's see if you can clean up
like little ladies!

12:11.732 --> 12:14.359
Let's make sure nothing is missing.

12:14.860 --> 12:18.155
- What about the beers, boss?
- We'll go drink them tonight!

12:18.363 --> 12:21.867
- You are the king of empty promises!
- Not this time.

12:22.993 --> 12:24.870
You're buying anyway!

13:00.572 --> 13:02.616
What's up, dude?

13:11.708 --> 13:15.962
<i>Life is worth nothing</i>

13:17.589 --> 13:21.009
<i>It always begins with crying</i>

13:21.176 --> 13:24.387
<i>And with crying it ends</i>

13:24.513 --> 13:27.974
<i>And that is why in this world</i>

13:28.141 --> 13:32.187
<i>Life is worth nothing</i>

14:43.300 --> 14:45.844
My father had told me
not to make a sound.

14:47.888 --> 14:50.974
All of a sudden
I heard a really loud shot.

14:51.266 --> 14:54.686
The kind of sound
that just rings in your ears.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.567
Then we went to check it out...

15:07.741 --> 15:10.243
And the deer was just lying there.

15:11.494 --> 15:13.580
It had a hole in its head.

15:13.914 --> 15:16.416
A bit of blood was coming out.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.794
It tried to get up but it wasn't able to.

15:21.755 --> 15:25.133
It just lay there and gave up.

15:26.718 --> 15:29.304
I stood there looking at it.

15:30.138 --> 15:32.098
How old were you?

15:32.265 --> 15:34.726
Eleven or so, twelve.

15:34.893 --> 15:38.188
My father took its intestines out and...

15:39.064 --> 15:40.815
roasted them.

15:44.361 --> 15:47.280
I threw up my dinner that night.

15:47.405 --> 15:50.408
And that's why you can't eat meat?

15:52.786 --> 15:54.079
Yeah.

15:55.580 --> 15:56.957
Come here!

15:59.709 --> 16:01.628
Again, Angel?

18:06.461 --> 18:09.422
Keep pressing it for a minute.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.927
Just take the medicine to make sure.

18:14.052 --> 18:16.805
But the wound is not infected,
it looks good.

18:16.971 --> 18:18.139
Yes, doctor.

18:18.306 --> 18:20.475
Careful with those dogs!

18:23.353 --> 18:26.106
- He's cute, don't you think?
- Yeah. I don't know.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.862
Do you have a lot of friends here?

18:33.029 --> 18:34.989
Some, not many.

18:36.241 --> 18:38.243
Neither do I.

18:47.127 --> 18:48.795
You're funny.

18:50.255 --> 18:53.049
That's the nicest thing
anyone has said to me in days.

18:57.595 --> 19:00.056
I'm coming out of a relationship.

19:00.265 --> 19:02.475
A romantic relationship?

19:03.351 --> 19:05.270
I'm sorry.

19:06.271 --> 19:08.273
Do you have somebody?

19:09.107 --> 19:11.151
Not really.

19:11.776 --> 19:13.403
Do you like sex?

19:14.779 --> 19:16.281
Don't we all?

19:17.490 --> 19:19.492
With men or with women?

19:22.036 --> 19:23.288
Sorry.

19:23.621 --> 19:26.374
I'm a bit clumsy socially,
like I told you.

19:26.541 --> 19:28.126
Done.

19:33.047 --> 19:35.133
One of these days
we should go out dancing.

19:35.258 --> 19:35.925
Okay.

19:36.050 --> 19:38.595
I'll invite my sister,
so you can meet her.

19:41.639 --> 19:43.683
<i>Yellow rictus.</i>

19:43.850 --> 19:45.351
<i>Black talons.</i>

19:45.768 --> 19:48.271
<i>White head with some brown stripes.</i>

19:48.438 --> 19:52.483
<i>Black primaries with white tips,
one of them all white.</i>

19:53.067 --> 19:55.361
<i>It's a case of partial albinism.</i>

19:55.695 --> 19:59.365
<i>I once captured one of these
on a birdwatch.</i>

20:00.074 --> 20:01.242
<i>Female adult.</i>

20:01.409 --> 20:03.077
<i>Llano Largo, Santa Rosa.</i>

20:03.244 --> 20:04.746
<i>Autumn.</i>

20:06.372 --> 20:08.875
And those are yesterday's notes.

20:14.130 --> 20:16.466
Good work, darling.

20:18.927 --> 20:20.678
She is so confident.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.890
If she's not careful
she's going to get hurt.

20:25.099 --> 20:26.684
I want her to stop coming.

21:07.183 --> 21:08.351
How is it?

21:08.935 --> 21:10.186
Bad.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.522
It's worse and worse.

21:16.025 --> 21:17.902
I want to see it.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.114
That's not a good idea.

21:22.490 --> 21:24.117
It's dangerous.

21:25.493 --> 21:27.704
We have to find someone else.

21:31.666 --> 21:34.711
What about the male nurse you met?

21:39.299 --> 21:41.134
Trial and error.

21:48.141 --> 21:50.059
Don't get near it, Verónica!

21:57.984 --> 22:00.194
WHAT'S UP?

22:00.361 --> 22:03.948
I WANNA SEE YOU, I WANNA FUCK! ;)

22:14.667 --> 22:15.835
Angel!

22:17.670 --> 22:19.964
Come on, "Piss man"!

22:52.580 --> 22:54.624
I'm also in an unhealthy relationship.

22:54.791 --> 22:56.000
Really?

22:56.209 --> 22:59.420
I don't want him to call me
because I always fall for it.

22:59.754 --> 23:01.047
I can't help it.

23:01.839 --> 23:04.759
Then I feel so bad,
like if I had a hangover.

23:05.802 --> 23:08.638
It's like an addiction
that won't let me be free.

23:08.805 --> 23:11.391
And some people
could end up really hurt.

23:13.518 --> 23:15.395
I'm in a similar situation.

23:17.814 --> 23:19.816
And why aren't you together?

23:22.110 --> 23:24.237
We started to hurt each other.

23:24.404 --> 23:26.447
But he calls and you always go back?

23:26.614 --> 23:28.157
He doesn't call me.

23:28.324 --> 23:31.119
I just keep going back and can't stop.

23:31.285 --> 23:32.995
It's complicated.

23:34.163 --> 23:36.207
What is he like?

23:36.791 --> 23:39.293
I'm not sure if it's a he or a she.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.880
- You're teasing me!
- I'm not!

23:43.214 --> 23:45.425
Show me a picture, I'll tell you.

23:45.591 --> 23:47.385
I don't have any pictures!

23:52.890 --> 23:54.016
Hey.

23:54.809 --> 23:55.810
What?

23:55.935 --> 23:58.312
You know you have beautiful eyes?

24:03.109 --> 24:04.360
Thank you.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.116
<i>One, two, three!</i>

24:10.324 --> 24:13.619
<i>Swing, swing, swing,
Don't miss the target.</i>

24:24.964 --> 24:26.340
Where are you going?

24:27.341 --> 24:30.428
Are you sure you are going to the potty?

24:31.220 --> 24:32.472
- Yes!
- Run!

24:51.657 --> 24:53.659
Wasn't your brother going to come?

24:53.868 --> 24:55.536
He said so.

24:55.703 --> 24:57.955
But maybe he got busy at work.

24:58.164 --> 25:00.166
He might come along with Vero.

25:00.374 --> 25:01.501
Who?

25:01.876 --> 25:04.045
His new friend Verónica.

25:04.212 --> 25:05.588
A girlfriend?

25:06.088 --> 25:08.758
But he's a super faggot!

25:08.925 --> 25:10.176
Woman friend!

25:10.384 --> 25:12.386
Not a girlfriend or anything like that.

25:17.308 --> 25:18.476
It's for the best.

25:18.684 --> 25:21.562
His gayness might rub off on the kids.

25:21.729 --> 25:24.023
Don't talk about my brother like that!

25:24.774 --> 25:28.277
Your son wouldn't get out of
the ball pit. He peed his pants.

25:28.611 --> 25:31.447
- What happened?
- Mama, I wet myself...

25:32.156 --> 25:33.366
Let's go.

25:33.491 --> 25:35.076
You never peed yourself as a child.

25:35.243 --> 25:37.662
And always told us when you had to go.

25:38.371 --> 25:39.872
Let's get out of there, children!

25:39.997 --> 25:42.166
Someone dirtied all the balls!

25:59.600 --> 26:02.562
<i>It's the most beautiful thing
you'll see in this life.</i>

26:04.021 --> 26:06.399
<i>In the whole universe maybe.</i>

26:08.276 --> 26:10.194
<i>Nothing will ever be the same.</i>

26:12.613 --> 26:14.448
<i>I'm nervous, Verónica.</i>

26:14.615 --> 26:16.325
<i>This is all very strange.</i>

26:16.492 --> 26:18.202
<i>Trust me.</i>

26:26.335 --> 26:28.796
It's going to like you.

26:49.525 --> 26:52.153
Follow the stream! You can't get lost!

29:46.744 --> 29:47.870
What's up?

29:49.163 --> 29:51.207
Your new girlfriend?

30:01.717 --> 30:03.677
You're peeing all over the place.

30:32.790 --> 30:34.291
<i>- Let's go
- What's up'?</i>

30:35.668 --> 30:36.544
Leave her alone!

30:36.877 --> 30:38.963
None of your business, buddy!

30:46.470 --> 30:49.014
Hold on! Hold on!

30:49.181 --> 30:50.474
Cool it!

30:54.728 --> 30:57.314
What would you have done
if I hadn't been there?

30:58.232 --> 30:59.608
Huh?

31:01.485 --> 31:03.112
Answer me!

31:10.286 --> 31:12.705
What would you have done
after dancing with that fucker?

31:12.830 --> 31:14.498
Calm down, dude!

31:20.588 --> 31:22.464
- Tell me!
- Let go!

31:24.967 --> 31:26.343
Let go!

31:43.819 --> 31:46.113
Sometimes he acts like an idiot!

31:47.072 --> 31:49.283
You'll just have to get used to it, Ale.

31:51.702 --> 31:53.287
I just can't do it.

31:55.164 --> 31:56.707
And where would you go?

31:56.874 --> 31:57.958
Anywhere.

31:58.626 --> 32:00.920
There has to be more to life than this.

32:09.011 --> 32:10.596
Let's go eat pizza!

32:12.139 --> 32:14.099
Kids, your mum is working.

32:14.308 --> 32:16.644
Ale, I'm going to take them to lunch.

32:24.985 --> 32:27.905
She always gives them sweets
before they eat.

32:28.364 --> 32:30.741
That's how all mothers-in-law are, Ale.

32:31.867 --> 32:35.120
At least this one lets you work
at her candy factory.

32:45.923 --> 32:47.967
You look kind of fucked up.

32:50.344 --> 32:53.472
Alejandra asked
why you are so distant lately.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.226
You came just to tell me that?

32:58.727 --> 33:00.854
She told me to ask you.

33:00.980 --> 33:02.856
Why didn't she call me?

33:03.023 --> 33:05.442
Because you don't pick up the phone.

33:10.239 --> 33:13.867
I've been calling you and texting you
for two fucking days.

33:16.704 --> 33:18.580
What are you laughing at?

33:18.914 --> 33:20.916
Someone could see us here.

33:23.919 --> 33:26.213
If you want to tell me something
just say it!

33:26.380 --> 33:27.798
I already did.

33:29.591 --> 33:31.301
I do have something to say.

33:32.469 --> 33:34.388
I don't need to live like this.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.306
I don't deserve it.

33:38.767 --> 33:40.436
"I don't deserve it".

33:42.396 --> 33:44.314
You're illuminated now?

33:48.027 --> 33:49.903
You met someone?

33:52.531 --> 33:55.451
Or what?
You got yourself another faggot?

33:56.410 --> 33:57.494
Maybe.

34:04.001 --> 34:06.211
I just came to give you that message

34:06.420 --> 34:09.422
that your nephews miss you.

34:14.887 --> 34:15.888
It's over.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.056
What's over?

34:17.222 --> 34:18.891
Lower your voice.

34:22.226 --> 34:25.313
Why are you going to stop
seeing your sister and nephews?

34:25.481 --> 34:27.190
It's you I don't want to see anymore.

34:27.608 --> 34:29.400
I have to get back to work.

34:33.489 --> 34:35.449
Say hi to the kids for me.

35:13.070 --> 35:15.030
Angel, don't be a pig!

35:18.033 --> 35:20.202
I'm a piece of shit!

35:28.919 --> 35:30.587
- Go to bed now.
- No!

35:30.796 --> 35:32.047
Please don't yell.

35:32.214 --> 35:34.091
I didn't want to do it!

35:34.299 --> 35:35.884
I was provoked!

35:37.511 --> 35:39.054
I'm an animal!

35:40.222 --> 35:41.515
Angel!

35:42.391 --> 35:43.684
What are you saying?

35:43.851 --> 35:45.352
Just go to sleep.

35:53.193 --> 35:55.404
Be quiet. The kids.

35:59.575 --> 36:00.742
It's okay.

36:00.909 --> 36:02.327
Don't leave...

36:05.038 --> 36:06.456
Don't leave.

36:08.959 --> 36:10.878
I'm not going anywhere.

36:12.921 --> 36:14.548
Go to sleep.

36:36.069 --> 36:39.364
I was tending to my sheep

36:39.489 --> 36:41.450
and my dogs started to bark...

36:41.617 --> 36:45.746
and that's how I noticed he was there.

36:45.913 --> 36:47.206
What did you do?

36:47.372 --> 36:51.668
I tried getting him out, but I couldn't.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.962
He's damn heavy.

36:54.129 --> 36:56.423
Have you found other bodies?

36:56.590 --> 36:58.967
It's the second one

36:59.134 --> 37:00.886
I found.

37:01.970 --> 37:05.682
- And about what time did you find him?
- Seven in the morning.

37:11.480 --> 37:15.901
My dogs always alert me
of anything strange...

37:16.485 --> 37:18.779
They start barking...

37:50.644 --> 37:51.979
Move aside!

37:53.146 --> 37:54.690
Get back, please!

38:02.948 --> 38:06.243
Young man, are you okay?

38:06.952 --> 38:08.161
Is he alive?

38:23.677 --> 38:25.095
Buddy, are you okay?

38:29.141 --> 38:30.475
Stretcher?

38:32.227 --> 38:36.565
- Get back!
- Let me do my job!

38:39.818 --> 38:41.695
- Who found the body?
- Ask him.

38:44.740 --> 38:46.742
Wait, I'm stuck.

38:46.950 --> 38:48.076
Good afternoon, sir.

38:48.243 --> 38:50.954
- Did you find this man?
- Yes.

38:52.331 --> 38:53.498
What's your name?

38:53.665 --> 38:56.251
Okay. The stretcher.
Let's drag it from here.

38:57.210 --> 38:59.671
Say, Pedro,
what time was it when you left?

38:59.838 --> 39:02.049
- One...
- Two!

39:39.961 --> 39:44.466
He suffered a fracture to the skull
as a result of several blows to the head.

39:45.050 --> 39:48.178
Apparently he also suffered
sexual aggression.

39:51.765 --> 39:53.767
It's amazing he's still alive.

39:56.061 --> 39:59.272
He's in a coma now, but stable.

40:01.817 --> 40:03.610
When will he wake up?

40:03.777 --> 40:05.404
We can't say.

40:06.071 --> 40:09.950
It depends on how his body
reacts to the medication.

40:11.284 --> 40:12.661
Excuse me.

40:15.330 --> 40:17.165
- Doctor?
- Yes?

40:18.917 --> 40:20.335
If I talk to him...

40:20.794 --> 40:22.337
can he hear me?

40:25.382 --> 40:26.675
Maybe.

40:56.163 --> 40:57.789
How are you doing, sweetheart?

40:59.875 --> 41:01.001
Fine.

41:04.296 --> 41:06.631
What have they gotten us into, son?

41:14.806 --> 41:16.433
I don't eat meat.

41:17.392 --> 41:18.852
You know that.

41:19.060 --> 41:22.063
If you want to get rid of that allergy
you have to start getting used to it.

41:22.189 --> 41:24.107
It's all in your head.

41:24.941 --> 41:27.277
I don't feel like it today.

41:34.910 --> 41:36.578
Come and eat!

41:46.129 --> 41:48.298
Hey kids, be easy on your mother!

41:48.798 --> 41:50.133
Hey, my love!

41:50.300 --> 41:51.801
How is he doing?

41:53.303 --> 41:54.888
Any news?

41:55.096 --> 41:56.473
The same.

41:57.641 --> 41:59.643
I have to go back to the hospital today.

41:59.809 --> 42:02.020
Don't worry about getting back
to the factory.

42:02.187 --> 42:04.356
We can discuss that later.

42:05.315 --> 42:06.733
I need the toilet.

42:08.318 --> 42:12.030
What did my uncle do
that made God punish him?

42:12.197 --> 42:13.698
Nothing, lván.

42:19.913 --> 42:22.832
At five I have the medical update
from the doctor.

42:28.505 --> 42:30.966
Did you go see my brother
at the hospital?

42:32.259 --> 42:34.219
We went together, didn't we?

42:37.264 --> 42:39.182
Before he was hurt.

42:41.851 --> 42:43.144
No.

42:48.525 --> 42:51.987
It's just that one of his co-workers
says that he saw you...

42:52.153 --> 42:54.990
arguing with him in the parking lot.

42:55.156 --> 42:56.449
No.

42:59.494 --> 43:01.997
They say they saw you with him.

43:03.456 --> 43:05.208
Why would I go see him there?

43:05.375 --> 43:09.504
The only reason I ever spoke to him
was because he was your brother.

43:10.964 --> 43:12.716
He's still alive.

43:16.970 --> 43:22.309
Okay, well, you know that in general
I don't talk to people like him.

43:22.475 --> 43:24.769
That's what I'm trying to say.

44:11.107 --> 44:12.567
Hello, Alejandra.

44:13.735 --> 44:14.944
Hey.

44:15.070 --> 44:16.446
How are you?

44:22.994 --> 44:24.496
How is he doing?

44:25.580 --> 44:26.748
The same.

44:29.959 --> 44:31.753
Are you busy now?

44:31.878 --> 44:33.546
You want to talk?

44:34.297 --> 44:36.174
It could be good for you.

44:40.095 --> 44:42.472
I need to go to my brother's house.

45:20.885 --> 45:24.305
I'll clean this up while you look
for the birth certificate.

46:17.567 --> 46:18.693
Ale...

46:18.860 --> 46:20.153
ls everything okay?

46:20.945 --> 46:24.365
ANSWER ME FAGGOT!!
I WANT TO BREAK YOUR FACE!!

46:25.158 --> 46:29.579
I'M GOING TO BREAK YOUR EVERY BONE!!
C'MON, JUST CALL ME. I'M HORNY!!

47:07.534 --> 47:09.911
Zoo. You're missing an "o".

47:20.964 --> 47:22.423
- Dad!
- Dad!

47:22.507 --> 47:23.967
Stay here.

47:24.926 --> 47:26.135
Hello, champ!

47:26.261 --> 47:27.637
How was school?

47:28.763 --> 47:30.014
- Fine.
- That's good.

47:30.181 --> 47:31.975
I got into a fight with Gustavo.

47:32.141 --> 47:33.226
Really?

47:33.434 --> 47:34.936
- Did you win?
- Yes.

47:35.061 --> 47:36.521
Oops...

47:39.357 --> 47:41.150
Any news about your brother?

47:41.526 --> 47:42.735
How is he?

47:43.278 --> 47:44.571
The same.

47:45.655 --> 47:47.949
You know that I'm here for you, right?

47:49.075 --> 47:51.160
Your face feels scratchy.

47:52.787 --> 47:54.497
I'm going to take a shower.

48:06.467 --> 48:07.886
Like this, Mum?

48:08.052 --> 48:09.095
Mum?

48:27.822 --> 48:29.073
What's up?

48:43.880 --> 48:45.590
Everything all right, Ale?

48:57.852 --> 49:03.274
He has normal pressure,
heart rate, pulse.

49:04.067 --> 49:07.737
But it's the machine
that is giving that to him.

49:08.237 --> 49:12.408
If we took away those machines...

49:12.784 --> 49:15.078
he would die.

49:21.542 --> 49:24.170
We liked Fabián very much here.

49:33.388 --> 49:37.308
But the fact is that it could take
a very long time before he wakes up.

49:38.226 --> 49:40.478
If he ever wakes up.

49:42.647 --> 49:45.483
Did you take the multimetre?

49:48.194 --> 49:50.822
The isolation metre...

50:04.210 --> 50:05.920
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning.

50:06.087 --> 50:09.465
Mr. José Angel Vázquez Rocha?

50:09.882 --> 50:10.925
Yes, that's me.

50:11.092 --> 50:12.301
Secure him, please.

50:12.468 --> 50:13.803
Hey! But why?

50:13.928 --> 50:16.806
- Let go! No! Let go!
- What's going on, officer?!

50:16.973 --> 50:19.392
We have an arrest warrant.

50:22.311 --> 50:25.314
- Why are you arresting me?
- We have an arrest warrant.

50:28.651 --> 50:30.653
You're hurting me! Let me go!

50:30.820 --> 50:32.613
Why are you taking me?

50:32.739 --> 50:35.116
Stay put, buddy!
I'll arrest you all!

50:40.913 --> 50:42.957
I do not recall how he was dressed.

50:43.124 --> 50:45.668
"I do not recall how he was dressed."

50:46.335 --> 50:49.964
But I do recall this man, this person,

50:50.131 --> 50:55.136
having an altercation
in the back area of the parking lot.

50:55.344 --> 50:58.389
But I do recall this man, this person.

50:58.556 --> 51:03.186
Having an altercation
in the back area of the parking lot."

51:04.187 --> 51:06.939
And that he violently
pushed my colleague Fabián.

51:07.106 --> 51:10.443
"And that he violently
pushed my colleague Fabián."

51:11.027 --> 51:13.404
Do you remember
the time of the incident?

51:13.571 --> 51:17.200
"Do you remember
the time of the incident?"

51:17.325 --> 51:19.035
Late afternoon...

51:19.202 --> 51:22.288
I believe, around 6pm.

51:23.206 --> 51:24.665
I can't recall exactly.

51:24.957 --> 51:28.711
"Late afternoon,
I believe, around 6pm.

51:28.878 --> 51:30.588
I can't recall exactly."

51:35.384 --> 51:38.971
Do you know
the person behind the bars?

51:42.391 --> 51:45.269
Do you know
the person behind me?

51:51.192 --> 51:53.903
You have to answer
loud and clear.

51:59.951 --> 52:01.119
Yes, I know him.

52:01.452 --> 52:02.787
Louder, please.

52:04.413 --> 52:06.249
You are doing fine, Ale.

52:11.963 --> 52:13.506
Yes, I know him.

52:15.216 --> 52:16.843
"Yes, I know him."

52:21.764 --> 52:24.517
Please read the messages
from the cell phone.

52:57.466 --> 53:00.678
Don't be afraid, Mummy,
zombies don't really exist.

53:29.332 --> 53:30.416
Daddy!

53:33.419 --> 53:34.670
Hello.

53:37.340 --> 53:40.676
- Are you with my Dad?
- I told you your father is traveling.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.347
- Hey.
- Hello.

53:44.764 --> 53:45.848
What's up?

53:48.517 --> 53:50.728
I'd like to not be here...

53:51.979 --> 53:54.482
Or anywhere else really.

53:58.110 --> 54:00.905
So you've got somebody
in Tijuana?

54:04.450 --> 54:06.035
An aunt.

54:07.536 --> 54:10.539
She sent me a message
when she found out about Fabián.

54:11.916 --> 54:14.126
She said I could stay with her.

54:16.963 --> 54:18.631
What about Fabián?

54:19.423 --> 54:23.135
You'd leave him here?
Without hearing his side of the story?

54:27.556 --> 54:29.684
What if he doesn't wake up?

54:42.071 --> 54:44.198
You can't escape everything.

54:46.993 --> 54:48.744
Like Fabián and me...

54:49.954 --> 54:52.498
Escaping from Tijuana and look at us now.

54:55.543 --> 54:58.421
Did you and Fabián
come here because of Angel'?

55:11.892 --> 55:14.437
I feel I did everything wrong, Vero.

55:17.189 --> 55:20.443
I'm gonna help you.
Everything's going to be fine.

55:25.823 --> 55:28.242
Do you know you are beautiful?

55:56.771 --> 55:59.357
<i>Mum! Mum! Mum!</i>

56:04.820 --> 56:07.531
I'm here, lván! Mummy's here!

56:07.740 --> 56:10.076
- It's okay!
- Dad! Dad! Daddy!

56:10.326 --> 56:11.660
Enough, lván!

56:12.578 --> 56:15.039
Forgive me! Sorry!

56:16.165 --> 56:18.042
It's okay now.

56:19.085 --> 56:20.544
Calm down.

56:34.433 --> 56:35.935
Hurry UP!

56:37.061 --> 56:39.188
Let's get the sheep!

56:48.989 --> 56:50.616
I'll take care of them.

57:47.715 --> 57:49.175
Catch it!

57:55.764 --> 57:57.641
It went into the water!

58:25.377 --> 58:27.796
How long have you known Verónica?

58:28.714 --> 58:30.966
Since she was little.

58:32.301 --> 58:34.595
She found this place by accident.

58:35.763 --> 58:37.932
But drawn, like you.

58:42.102 --> 58:45.940
Have you had intense,
lucid dreams recently?

58:46.607 --> 58:47.816
No.

58:48.817 --> 58:51.195
That doesn't happen to everybody.

58:57.159 --> 58:59.453
Do you like Verónica?

59:00.037 --> 59:01.455
Yes.

59:02.748 --> 59:04.166
She's with my kids.

59:04.333 --> 59:06.752
Don't worry.
She's a good person.

59:13.509 --> 59:15.844
Let me see your eyes.

59:20.516 --> 59:21.767
Mouth.

59:24.979 --> 59:27.565
Forgive him.
He can be a brute sometimes.

59:38.534 --> 59:41.078
But that's how all scientists are.

59:44.790 --> 59:47.585
With the sensitivity of a rock.

01:00:01.599 --> 01:00:04.476
<i>At first you will think
you're hallucinating.</i>

01:00:09.607 --> 01:00:14.069
<i>This will probably make your brain
and body disconnect for a moment.</i>

01:00:16.655 --> 01:00:19.992
<i>You might lose your will and reason.</i>

01:00:26.332 --> 01:00:29.126
<i>This probably sounds strange...</i>

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:33.213
<i>But it will help, so don't get scared.</i>

01:00:34.214 --> 01:00:35.549
<i>It's normal.</i>

01:00:57.321 --> 01:01:00.199
<i>It hit the earth and left a small crater.</i>

01:01:01.367 --> 01:01:03.702
<i>The animals began arriving...</i>

01:01:04.119 --> 01:01:07.331
<i>They are more in touch
with their immediate needs.</i>

01:01:07.456 --> 01:01:09.416
<i>With their instincts.</i>

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.338
<i>What's there in the cabin...</i>

01:01:14.463 --> 01:01:16.840
<i>is our primitive side.</i>

01:01:17.716 --> 01:01:20.761
<i>In its most basic and purest state.</i>

01:01:20.928 --> 01:01:22.763
Materialised.

01:01:24.973 --> 01:01:27.351
<i>It's never going to disappear...</i>

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:30.354
<i>It's only going to perfect itself.</i>

01:02:14.231 --> 01:02:15.733
I feel strange.

01:02:16.316 --> 01:02:18.444
- It's going to be okay.
- I think it was the tea.

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:20.529
Calm down.

01:02:29.413 --> 01:02:31.206
Calm down.

01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:56.190
She's ready.

01:04:50.804 --> 01:04:52.431
How are you?

01:05:07.362 --> 01:05:09.573
My brother was also with it?

01:05:11.283 --> 01:05:12.284
Yes.

01:05:21.585 --> 01:05:23.086
Would you go back?

01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:47.903
And that's what hurt him?

01:05:53.492 --> 01:05:54.826
<i>No.</i>

01:05:54.993 --> 01:05:56.995
<i>It can only give pleasure.</i>

01:05:57.913 --> 01:05:59.957
<i>It has never hurt anybody.</i>

01:07:22.122 --> 01:07:23.123
Hey, Vero!

01:07:25.042 --> 01:07:26.084
Vero!

01:07:26.251 --> 01:07:27.586
Are you okay?

01:07:40.474 --> 01:07:41.767
Excuse me.

01:08:08.376 --> 01:08:09.753
It's going to be okay.

01:08:10.170 --> 01:08:13.006
It's been better
since Alejandra has been coming.

01:08:15.675 --> 01:08:17.676
Now you need to get well.

01:08:19.805 --> 01:08:22.515
It's not good for you, or for him.

01:08:41.493 --> 01:08:43.703
It's the purest sensation I've felt.

01:08:46.497 --> 01:08:49.000
Someday it might get tired of you.

01:08:49.584 --> 01:08:52.002
And you'll have to find someone else.

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:01.680
Are you okay?

01:09:01.846 --> 01:09:03.140
Yes.

01:09:10.939 --> 01:09:13.441
Now I know that's what hurt my brother.

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:17.069
I'm sorry.

01:09:17.444 --> 01:09:19.113
Sometimes it doesn't work.

01:09:19.322 --> 01:09:21.116
And it's too much for some.

01:09:21.323 --> 01:09:23.410
You shouldn't lie.

01:09:23.577 --> 01:09:25.203
But I understand.

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:28.456
It makes me feel so good

01:09:28.622 --> 01:09:32.169
that it wipes out any resentment or hate.

01:09:37.883 --> 01:09:39.759
I have to get out of here.

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:44.930
Where are you going to go?

01:09:46.057 --> 01:09:48.685
A new place to live, that's all.

01:09:50.895 --> 01:09:52.898
Or a new mountain.

01:10:06.369 --> 01:10:07.579
Thank you.

01:10:47.202 --> 01:10:49.871
Let's go.
Say goodbye to the teacher.

01:10:50.038 --> 01:10:51.539
Goodbye. Have a nice day!

01:10:51.706 --> 01:10:54.000
What's wrong?
Did you fall or something?

01:10:54.167 --> 01:10:55.669
Hello, good afternoon.

01:10:55.794 --> 01:10:57.587
Iván and Jacobo?

01:10:57.754 --> 01:10:59.756
They have already been picked up.

01:10:59.965 --> 01:11:00.966
What do you mean?

01:11:01.258 --> 01:11:03.969
Their grandmother. They said you knew.

01:11:04.094 --> 01:11:06.304
I'm sorry, but I thought...

01:11:10.684 --> 01:11:11.685
Yes?

01:11:12.352 --> 01:11:14.521
Graciela, I came to get my children!

01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:19.859
I came to get my children.

01:11:20.026 --> 01:11:21.861
They're fine, they had lunch.

01:11:22.028 --> 01:11:23.571
They're doing their homework now.

01:11:23.738 --> 01:11:26.741
Have them get their things.
I'm taking them with me.

01:11:29.995 --> 01:11:32.872
You can't take care of them on your own.

01:11:34.791 --> 01:11:36.042
But they are my...

01:11:40.005 --> 01:11:41.089
lván!

01:11:44.426 --> 01:11:45.593
Jacobo!

01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:53.226
- Mummy, are we leaving?
- Come out here, lván!

01:11:57.230 --> 01:11:59.858
Iván! Tell your grandma
to open the door!

01:12:05.905 --> 01:12:07.032
Girl!

01:12:13.371 --> 01:12:15.123
Move away, kids!

01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:18.877
<i>Grandma!</i>

01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:28.553
Mummy, is it true
that you put my dad in jail?

01:12:28.678 --> 01:12:29.846
He went on a trip.

01:12:30.055 --> 01:12:32.682
Grandma says you put him in the can.

01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:35.435
Don't listen to anything
that lady tells you.

01:12:35.602 --> 01:12:37.979
- Where did he go on his trip?
- I don't know.

01:12:38.146 --> 01:12:40.774
- When is he coming back?
- I don't know, lván!

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:44.194
When is my uncle gonna wake up?
So he can visit us.

01:12:44.361 --> 01:12:45.862
- I don't know!
- When?

01:12:45.904 --> 01:12:46.780
Never!

01:12:46.905 --> 01:12:50.158
Mum! Is it true
God punished uncle Fabián?

01:12:50.325 --> 01:12:52.118
Grandma said so.

01:12:54.329 --> 01:12:55.997
Your grandma is a lying witch.

01:12:56.164 --> 01:12:57.290
Mum...

01:12:57.791 --> 01:12:58.917
Let's play a game.

01:12:59.084 --> 01:13:01.920
Whoever can keep quiet all the way
to the house will win a prize.

01:13:02.087 --> 01:13:03.254
What prize?

01:13:03.421 --> 01:13:04.297
It's a surprise.

01:13:04.464 --> 01:13:06.049
And what if we both win?

01:13:06.174 --> 01:13:07.801
Then you both get the prize. Ready?

01:13:07.967 --> 01:13:10.303
One!
One, two, three! Shh.

01:13:20.647 --> 01:13:22.565
Puffy, where are you going?

01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:57.494
You're going to be okay.

01:15:02.749 --> 01:15:04.334
Forgive me.

01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:16.221
I'm going to miss you.

01:15:54.551 --> 01:15:56.469
You ruined the family.

01:15:57.262 --> 01:15:59.097
The candy business.

01:16:00.181 --> 01:16:03.017
We are an embarrassment
to this place now.

01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:06.980
I'm out because I'm innocent, Mum.

01:16:09.816 --> 01:16:12.318
You are here because we got you out.

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:15.113
Because we sold your house.

01:16:15.697 --> 01:16:18.074
Because your father knows the judge.

01:16:28.543 --> 01:16:30.169
Take a look.

01:16:32.505 --> 01:16:34.090
You have none of God's forgiveness.

01:16:34.424 --> 01:16:36.926
CHEATS ON WIFE WITH BROTHER-IN-LAW

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:39.804
THE LITTLE FAGGOT FROM HOSPITAL 33
LEFT IN COMA FOR REFUSING SEX

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:42.557
Go to Mexico City, or wherever you want.

01:16:43.057 --> 01:16:45.393
We'll send you money so you can get by.

01:16:46.185 --> 01:16:48.438
You have no home here anymore.

01:16:49.647 --> 01:16:51.399
You have nothing.

01:16:53.234 --> 01:16:55.028
What about my children?

01:16:57.572 --> 01:17:00.908
Living in a hippie commune
in Pardo Street.

01:17:01.701 --> 01:17:04.621
You can imagine
what that must be like for them.

01:18:25.076 --> 01:18:27.453
<i>Angel! Open UP!</i>

01:18:40.425 --> 01:18:43.261
- What's up?
- What do you mean, "What's up"?!

01:18:44.137 --> 01:18:45.638
Dumbass!

01:18:59.277 --> 01:19:01.154
I'm sorry, Dad!

01:19:33.478 --> 01:19:36.522
What do you mean
you don't know where you're going?

01:19:36.981 --> 01:19:40.276
You don't have to tell me,
but I just don't believe it.

01:19:41.194 --> 01:19:43.488
Just looking for a new place.

01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:45.907
With new people.

01:19:54.749 --> 01:19:56.876
And what is your favourite thing to hunt?

01:19:57.585 --> 01:19:59.003
Wild boar.

01:19:59.212 --> 01:20:01.547
I like it because I do it with my dogs.

01:20:09.013 --> 01:20:11.307
Those dogs you have in that truck there?

01:20:13.768 --> 01:20:15.269
That's them.

01:20:18.356 --> 01:20:20.733
I spend all night
in the countryside with them.

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:22.360
It's fun.

01:20:24.237 --> 01:20:26.572
I let them loose
and they find the boar.

01:20:26.739 --> 01:20:28.658
I shoot and gut them.

01:20:31.244 --> 01:20:33.621
But it's not at all easy
to find a wild boar.

01:20:33.788 --> 01:20:35.665
That's what makes it fun.

01:20:38.835 --> 01:20:40.795
Yeah, sounds fun.

01:20:48.052 --> 01:20:49.762
Sometimes I come back empty-handed

01:20:49.929 --> 01:20:52.056
but it's good to get out
once in a while.

01:20:52.265 --> 01:20:54.058
I like the countryside.

01:21:00.565 --> 01:21:01.899
And you?

01:21:07.071 --> 01:21:09.365
<i>Jonathan, I told you to behave!</i>

01:21:09.574 --> 01:21:12.285
<i>You're grounded for the week!</i>

01:21:39.896 --> 01:21:41.772
Are you okay?

01:22:01.208 --> 01:22:04.086
We're here
because we both want to be, right?

01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:07.673
Yes.

01:22:29.654 --> 01:22:31.614
Can you spend the night?

01:22:34.158 --> 01:22:36.369
I don't think that's a good idea.

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:42.541
Please.

01:22:43.876 --> 01:22:46.170
I'm afraid I'll go back.

01:23:19.912 --> 01:23:21.205
Angel...

01:23:21.706 --> 01:23:23.207
Hello, Ale.

01:23:32.216 --> 01:23:34.593
I know you didn't do anything...

01:23:35.052 --> 01:23:36.846
to Fabián.

01:23:43.227 --> 01:23:44.979
Who is that blonde guy who just left?

01:23:45.146 --> 01:23:46.731
He's a tenant.

01:23:47.565 --> 01:23:49.233
He rents a room here.

01:23:50.943 --> 01:23:54.113
Do you have one for me?
Because I'm homeless.

01:23:56.365 --> 01:23:59.452
If you knew it wasn't me...

01:23:59.577 --> 01:24:02.747
Why didn't you tell the police?

01:24:03.330 --> 01:24:04.749
I'm sorry.

01:24:04.874 --> 01:24:07.001
I tried but they didn't believe me.

01:24:07.168 --> 01:24:09.336
They needed more evidence.

01:24:10.129 --> 01:24:12.381
Since you were having
a relationship with my brother.

01:24:13.674 --> 01:24:16.969
You're the sick one for imagining that.

01:24:18.137 --> 01:24:20.264
What do you want?

01:24:22.850 --> 01:24:24.560
I want to get my family back.

01:24:26.479 --> 01:24:28.606
You asked for my forgiveness.

01:24:29.148 --> 01:24:30.149
I forgive you.

01:24:31.525 --> 01:24:32.818
Not anymore.

01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:37.490
We're not going to be
together again, Angel.

01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:41.660
We have children, for fuck's sake!

01:24:42.995 --> 01:24:45.289
Who have you been fucking?

01:24:48.793 --> 01:24:51.837
Who are you with?
With that blonde guy?

01:24:55.049 --> 01:24:56.425
Tell me!

01:24:59.303 --> 01:25:02.098
We can try to fix things, Ale.

01:25:04.517 --> 01:25:07.103
I can forgive you if you forgive me.

01:25:09.814 --> 01:25:11.816
We'll leave this place...

01:25:12.358 --> 01:25:14.527
All this shit.

01:25:14.652 --> 01:25:16.529
My parents, everything.

01:25:21.534 --> 01:25:23.828
Maybe it's better if you leave now

01:25:24.370 --> 01:25:26.831
and when you calm down we can talk.

01:25:27.039 --> 01:25:29.333
- I am calm.
- You're not calm.

01:25:32.962 --> 01:25:34.630
Let's not talk about it anymore.

01:25:34.839 --> 01:25:38.050
Let's go get the kids and just leave.

01:25:38.551 --> 01:25:41.178
- We'll talk later.
- I don't want to leave.

01:25:43.097 --> 01:25:45.933
For the first time in a long time
I am good.

01:25:47.226 --> 01:25:49.395
I feel good.

01:25:53.941 --> 01:25:55.317
Good?

01:25:58.904 --> 01:26:00.656
Who is he?

01:26:01.323 --> 01:26:03.117
Do I know him?

01:26:08.873 --> 01:26:10.457
Come here!

01:26:12.418 --> 01:26:14.044
So, that's it?

01:26:21.093 --> 01:26:24.889
You don't want to see me anymore?
Because that's what you want, right?

01:26:25.222 --> 01:26:26.974
I'll grant you the wish!

01:26:36.609 --> 01:26:37.943
Ale!

01:26:38.402 --> 01:26:39.820
Ale!

01:26:42.198 --> 01:26:43.449
Help me!

01:28:39.815 --> 01:28:41.817
Why are we in the forest?

01:28:42.443 --> 01:28:43.861
You will see.

01:28:45.571 --> 01:28:47.406
And you'll understand.

01:29:03.422 --> 01:29:05.174
It will be beautiful...

01:29:05.883 --> 01:29:06.967
What...

01:29:08.135 --> 01:29:09.928
You will be fine.

01:29:36.121 --> 01:29:37.873
Mr. Vega?

01:29:39.833 --> 01:29:41.543
Marta?

01:29:52.012 --> 01:29:53.222
Vero!

01:31:07.588 --> 01:31:09.965
I had to take Marta to the hospital.

01:31:10.132 --> 01:31:13.093
With some broken ribs
and a black eye.

01:31:33.489 --> 01:31:35.866
The bodies are piling up.

01:32:01.099 --> 01:32:02.768
Iván!

01:32:03.435 --> 01:32:07.064
- He's here, Ma'am!
- Jacobo, Mum is here.

01:32:22.329 --> 01:32:24.373
Why's your blouse stained, Mummy?
