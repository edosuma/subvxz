<i>Racing, it's our drug.</i>

00:14.890 --> 00:16.993
<i>What goes through my mind
when I'm on the starting line</i>

00:17.017 --> 00:19.120
<i>is I'm wondering how much power
the guy next to me has</i>

00:19.144 --> 00:21.104
<i>and if he's gonna be able
to put it to the ground.</i>

00:21.605 --> 00:23.365
<i>I think supercars
are for rich people.</i>

00:24.608 --> 00:26.401
<i>You can go buy 100 of them.</i>

00:27.194 --> 00:28.946
<i>I got a unique, different vehicle.</i>

00:29.029 --> 00:30.906
<i>You know, it's from Detroit,
built in Detroit.</i>

00:30.989 --> 00:34.326
<i>One quarter-of-a-million-dollar car
racing three yo-yos</i>

00:34.451 --> 00:36.119
<i>like myself from the street.</i>

00:36.912 --> 00:39.164
You know that feeling
of when you saw your child

00:39.248 --> 00:41.792
for the first time,
that feeling inside?

00:41.875 --> 00:44.795
<i>That's the feeling I get
when I'm in a National.</i>

00:45.295 --> 00:48.882
<i>It's exciting for me
to race the parts that I make.</i>

00:50.592 --> 00:53.470
<i>I'm man with machine, connected.</i>

00:53.637 --> 00:55.597
Come on, you gotta go!
We gotta go! Off!

00:55.806 --> 00:57.659
- Don't call me names.
- Hey, I don't give a fuck!

00:57.683 --> 00:59.035
- I do.
- What you gonna do about it?

00:59.059 --> 01:00.185
I'm repping Detroit!

<i>The definition
of a sleeper is a car</i>

01:19.413 --> 01:21.623
<i>that don't look the way it performs.</i>

01:21.999 --> 01:24.668
Look like your grandma could drive it,

01:25.002 --> 01:28.839
your auntie... Aunt Betty can drive it
to the grocery store.

01:29.506 --> 01:34.094
<i>But... when you let it rip,
it'll blow your mind.</i>

01:40.976 --> 01:42.603
<i>My name is Cedric Wade,</i>

01:42.686 --> 01:45.480
<i>coming from the big D,
Detroit, Michigan.</i>

01:47.899 --> 01:51.111
<i>I work in an automotive seating plant,</i>

01:51.528 --> 01:54.615
<i>where we all know Detroit
is the automotive hub of the world.</i>

01:55.532 --> 01:59.244
I've been at my plant
for 14 years this year.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.039
<i>I'm blessed, you know,
to have the job I have</i>

02:02.122 --> 02:06.627
<i>that can afford me to partake
in the thing I love to do,</i>

02:06.710 --> 02:10.547
<i>which is race, and the car I love
to do it in, which is the National.</i>

02:14.259 --> 02:18.889
<i>When I had built my first one,
I was laser-like focused.</i>

02:19.848 --> 02:23.477
I went to work
and worked all the overtime I could.

02:24.186 --> 02:29.316
I lived off potatoes.
I had potatoes, like, for four months.

02:29.775 --> 02:32.194
<i>Lunch, breakfast, dinner,</i>

02:32.527 --> 02:36.573
and every time I got hungry,
or got tired of the taste of potatoes,

02:36.823 --> 02:39.534
I just, uh, thought about the National.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.662
And that tightened me right on up.

02:43.163 --> 02:47.793
<i>People usually fall in love with the stuff
that they seen as kids, you know?</i>

02:48.001 --> 02:52.172
Seventy-year-old dudes
like the '68 Novas and Chevelles,

02:52.255 --> 02:54.095
<i>'cause they remember them
when they was little.</i>

02:54.800 --> 02:58.428
<i>I grew up in the early '80s
with G-bodies and stuff, you know,</i>

02:58.595 --> 03:01.306
<i>Regals, Monte Carlos, Cutlasses.</i>

03:01.390 --> 03:04.101
So, those were special to me.
That was the car I wanted.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.062
I didn't want no Chevelle, you know?
That's my daddy's car.

03:10.315 --> 03:15.237
<i>A guy in my neighborhood, he got
a Grand National for a graduation gift</i>

03:15.612 --> 03:19.408
<i>and he used to hot rod it
around the neighborhood.</i>

03:19.741 --> 03:22.703
And it looked a little different,
looked sportier than the regular Regals

03:22.828 --> 03:25.038
<i>and stuff, and, you know,
it just sounded different.</i>

03:25.163 --> 03:26.873
<i>It sounded like a chainsaw.</i>

03:29.376 --> 03:32.129
<i>But then it goes away,
and it sounds like a jet.</i>

03:33.630 --> 03:35.632
Sounds like a jet
taking off with a whistle.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.969
Just, it sounded weird.
It was like, "What's up under there?

03:39.052 --> 03:40.512
<i>You got a jet up under there?"</i>

03:42.097 --> 03:43.932
I just got infatuated, so,

03:44.057 --> 03:46.727
that's what made me, I was like,
"Oh, yeah, I got to get one."

03:55.485 --> 03:59.406
<i>Unknown thing that probably shock a lot
of people about the Grand Nationals</i>

03:59.489 --> 04:02.617
<i>is that in 1987,
that was the last year of production,</i>

04:02.909 --> 04:05.162
<i>they was the fastest American-made car.</i>

04:07.122 --> 04:09.207
<i>Faster than a Corvette,
faster than a Camaro,</i>

04:09.291 --> 04:11.418
<i>faster than anything
that was made in America.</i>

04:12.043 --> 04:14.963
<i>I haven't raced no supercars
on the street. They don't want to race.</i>

04:15.046 --> 04:19.676
The guys in the Ferraris and the Lambos,
I think they think you beneath them.

04:20.177 --> 04:23.096
<i>I don't even know
if I'd use the term "supercar,"</i>

04:23.180 --> 04:25.265
<i>'cause it ain't nothing really
super about them.</i>

04:25.348 --> 04:28.977
If I'd have hit that Powerball,
I wouldn't have bought one and stuff.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.605
I'd probably have ten Nationals, though.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.698
<i>My name is Nick.
I'm 30 years old.</i>

04:41.782 --> 04:45.202
I'm from Royal Oak, Michigan,
and I have a McLaren MP4.

04:49.581 --> 04:51.541
<i>Most people ask,
"What kind of car is that?"</i>

04:51.625 --> 04:53.627
Because over here in Michigan,

04:53.710 --> 04:56.379
there's about three or four McLarens
in the entire state.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.841
<i>I always dreamed and wished
that I would have a car like this</i>

04:59.925 --> 05:01.927
when I was growing up,
but it's a high hurdle,

05:02.010 --> 05:05.305
so... I don't know
if I really believed it.

05:07.557 --> 05:10.227
I was always into cars, you know?
I'd be one of those little kids

05:10.310 --> 05:12.187
on the side of the road,
giving the thumbs-up,

05:12.270 --> 05:14.064
waving to the cool car
that was going by.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.876
<i>I had always dreamed that I'd be able
to drive cars like this, you know?</i>

05:16.900 --> 05:19.820
And I think that part of
that passion is what's driven me

05:19.903 --> 05:22.948
to be an entrepreneur
and just kind of go after what I want.

05:23.782 --> 05:26.451
<i>Maybe it was because I saw
how hard my parents worked,</i>

05:26.993 --> 05:29.079
<i>nine to five, every day.</i>

05:30.372 --> 05:33.667
<i>As I started college,
I was around a bunch of entrepreneurs.</i>

05:33.750 --> 05:35.585
<i>I started my own company at that point.</i>

05:35.669 --> 05:37.671
<i>Then I started another company
when I was 28,</i>

05:37.754 --> 05:41.424
and it's fortunately afforded me
the ability to buy the toys that I like,

05:41.508 --> 05:43.343
and live the type of lifestyle
that I like.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.178
I'm on the next step.

05:45.303 --> 05:46.948
I want to be taller than you.

05:46.972 --> 05:48.699
<i>You're like an inch taller
than me, aren't you?</i>

05:48.723 --> 05:50.660
- I'm like 5'8" and a half.
- What are you?

05:50.684 --> 05:52.269
I think I'm 5'8" and a quarter.

05:52.727 --> 05:57.732
I don't think that being monogamous,
for me, particularly, is the right move.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.736
<i>Because I want the ability
to go wherever I want,</i>

06:00.610 --> 06:03.071
<i>do whatever I want,
date whoever I want.</i>

06:03.655 --> 06:06.215
<i>If I'm in a monogamous relationship,
I feel like I can't do that.</i>

06:08.869 --> 06:10.949
- You guys got enough room in there?
- Barely.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.506
<i>Well, I like a lot of things
about the McLaren, but I think that</i>

06:15.667 --> 06:18.879
what I love most
is that its entire anatomy

06:18.962 --> 06:21.006
is built around F1 racing.

06:23.758 --> 06:26.386
<i>It's built off a carbon fiber monobody,</i>

06:26.469 --> 06:28.805
meaning kind of where I'm sitting
right now

06:29.306 --> 06:32.017
<i>is one autoclaved carbon fiber shell,</i>

06:32.100 --> 06:34.185
<i>and everything else is built
off that shell,</i>

06:34.394 --> 06:36.688
<i>the same way that it would be
on a Formula 1 car</i>

06:36.771 --> 06:38.815
<i>or any other high-end track racing car.</i>

06:38.899 --> 06:43.570
<i>And it really gives the car a feel
of incredible stability.</i>

06:45.155 --> 06:48.742
When I was coming here on the freeway,
and there was a Camaro... And you know,

06:48.825 --> 06:51.721
he came up, and he was hitting the gas,
screwing with me a little bit, right?

06:51.745 --> 06:54.080
And I was like, "Eh, Camaro,
you know, I'm in a McLaren.

06:54.205 --> 06:56.875
I don't know, man. I don't know
if it's even worth the ticket."

06:57.208 --> 06:58.919
So I was like, âEh, fuck it,â you know?

06:59.336 --> 07:01.880
Downshifted to third
on the freeway and hit it.

07:01.963 --> 07:04.817
And he had some power, you know,
'cause he was there with me for a second.

07:04.841 --> 07:07.841
But I... That McLaren, it pulls away,
'cause it slips right through the air.

07:07.886 --> 07:11.014
It's not the right thing,
you know, with my 56 speeding tickets.

07:11.222 --> 07:14.392
I probably shouldn't engage
in that type of behavior, but it happens.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.913
How do you still have
a license with 56 speeding tickets?

07:16.937 --> 07:18.146
I have good lawyers.

07:26.321 --> 07:28.657
<i>I'm Dave Jarvis,
from Westland, Michigan.</i>

07:29.324 --> 07:32.285
<i>And what I love most
about driving my van is</i>

07:32.452 --> 07:35.330
finally, after all those hours
of hard work,

07:35.914 --> 07:38.249
<i>finally get to get out on that open road</i>

07:39.125 --> 07:40.835
<i>and listen to that motor sing.</i>

07:44.881 --> 07:47.550
<i>My '78 van that I started racing,</i>

07:47.634 --> 07:49.302
<i>I always wanted one.</i>

07:49.552 --> 07:52.055
My buddy Smitty had one
back in high school,

07:52.138 --> 07:54.766
and it was, like, the talk of the town.
It was this chick magnet.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.894
<i>I became obsessed
with trying to find one.</i>

07:58.186 --> 08:01.731
<i>Finally, in 1995,
I found one in the </i> Trading Times.

08:06.027 --> 08:09.489
It was awesome. It ran good,
and I enjoyed it like that for a while

08:09.698 --> 08:11.408
<i>until a couple of my racing buddies</i>

08:11.491 --> 08:14.536
<i>put a cobbled-up nitrous kit
on my van for me,</i>

08:15.078 --> 08:17.497
and I went out in front of the house,
and I floored it

08:17.580 --> 08:19.708
and hit the nitrous
for the first time in my life.

08:27.590 --> 08:31.970
To experience nitrous is, uh...
You'll just never forget it. I...

08:32.220 --> 08:35.724
It hooked me like no other at that point.
I said, "Wow."

08:43.313 --> 08:44.774
<i>I live in the Motor City.</i>

08:45.400 --> 08:47.569
<i>Grew up here my entire life.</i>

08:47.652 --> 08:50.864
<i>My dad worked
at Ford Motor Company till he passed.</i>

08:54.159 --> 08:56.369
<i>I love being around the auto industry.</i>

08:56.619 --> 08:59.622
<i>I'm a manual machinist.
I make parts by hand.</i>

09:00.206 --> 09:03.835
I work on a lot of race cars.
A lot of 'em, you guys.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.134
<i>My van is completely hand-made.</i>

09:11.426 --> 09:15.263
<i>Not the sheet metal.
Chevrolet made the body back in 1978.</i>

09:15.764 --> 09:18.141
<i>But pretty much everything else has been
all hand-made,</i>

09:18.266 --> 09:21.936
<i>the whole drive train and all the brackets
and everything, made by me.</i>

09:22.479 --> 09:26.357
Driving this van feels like harmony...

09:27.192 --> 09:29.819
between man and machine.

09:40.455 --> 09:43.458
<i>I started messing with the thing in 1995.</i>

09:43.750 --> 09:45.460
<i>I got it for 1,500 bucks.</i>

09:46.044 --> 09:49.923
<i>And now there's God knows how much money,
80 grand or more in it,</i>

09:50.006 --> 09:53.259
<i>plus thousands of hours of work
over all these years.</i>

09:54.010 --> 09:57.764
<i>And, uh... it just can't be replaced.
It makes me nervous.</i>

09:57.847 --> 09:59.641
<i>I hope nothing ever happens to it.</i>

10:00.183 --> 10:02.769
<i>Supercars are, you know, very intense.</i>

10:02.936 --> 10:05.688
I guarantee they'd all blow me away
on a road course.

10:05.855 --> 10:09.109
<i>But at a dragstrip,
it'd be very interesting to see.</i>

10:09.484 --> 10:13.071
I can't wait. I'm excited.
I hope the best for me.

10:15.240 --> 10:18.785
<i>Oh my God, when my van came out
in </i> Hot Rod <i>magazine,</i>

10:18.868 --> 10:22.038
I get a phone call from Little
Professor Bookstore in Ann Arbor.

10:22.122 --> 10:25.917
I said, "Oh, my God!"
"Mom, we gotta go!"

10:26.209 --> 10:28.169
<i>So, I jumped in the car with her,</i>

10:28.461 --> 10:31.548
<i>and we get to the Little Professor
Bookstore, and we go running in there,</i>

10:31.756 --> 10:35.635
and right in the middle,
there was my van doing this wheelie.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.429
And I just started bawling, crying.

10:38.513 --> 10:40.640
I was so excited,
I held it against my chest.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.559
We went out in the parking lot,

10:42.934 --> 10:45.937
and my mom actually had
to read the article to me

10:46.020 --> 10:50.066
while I sat in the driver's seat,
because I couldn't read it, I was crying.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.777
It meant the world to me.
It was so exciting.

10:52.861 --> 10:55.572
I'm so grateful and thankful
that she was there. And...

10:59.367 --> 11:00.827
Sorry.

11:02.871 --> 11:04.038
I'm sorry.

11:14.465 --> 11:16.301
My mom...
Excuse me.

11:18.052 --> 11:19.512
My mom was awesome.

11:20.805 --> 11:23.850
<i>She did everything for all of her kids.</i>

11:24.767 --> 11:26.811
<i>There's nothing she wouldn't do
for any of us.</i>

11:27.770 --> 11:30.773
<i>I lived with her most of my life,
'cause my dad, you know,</i>

11:30.857 --> 11:32.734
<i>had been gone our whole lives.</i>

11:33.735 --> 11:38.031
<i>And it was just so exciting
to have her here... with me.</i>

11:42.076 --> 11:45.914
Yeah, one time my mom followed me
to the race track

11:46.456 --> 11:48.750
in my Jeep with all my tools,

11:49.292 --> 11:52.629
and helped me race by being my pit crew.

11:53.004 --> 11:55.548
<i>She was almost 80 years old.
It was awesome.</i>

11:56.382 --> 11:59.344
<i>And on the way back, I said,
"Hey, Mom,</i>

11:59.427 --> 12:02.847
how would you like to go for a ride
in the van? I'll touch the nitrous."

12:03.389 --> 12:04.933
And she said she would love to.

12:07.018 --> 12:09.020
<i>And she hopped in the passenger seat,</i>

12:09.229 --> 12:13.191
<i>and I was able to take my mom
on a slight little pass</i>

12:13.274 --> 12:14.943
<i>and just touch the nitrous.</i>

12:15.026 --> 12:19.197
And me and Ma had a blast
in the van on nitrous.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.578
<i>I feel like now when I compete,</i>

12:25.912 --> 12:28.456
<i>I'm really trying to make
my mom proud of me.</i>

12:30.291 --> 12:32.877
<i>I'm gonna do everything
I can to win this race.</i>

12:33.920 --> 12:34.920
Anything.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.760
And we're gonna race four lanes wide,

12:41.261 --> 12:42.971
- quarter-mile.
- Wow.

12:43.054 --> 12:45.532
- So, you've got all the space?
- Four cars... Yeah, four cars.

12:45.556 --> 12:47.392
- Four cars are gonna go at once?
- Four cars.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.912
- Four cars at the same time.
- So, you're racing three people?

12:49.936 --> 12:50.936
Yeah, I know.

12:53.940 --> 12:57.193
<i>My name's Ryan Vuich,
and I'm from Downriver, Michigan.</i>

12:57.986 --> 13:02.991
<i>Downriver is a cluster of smaller cities
south of Detroit,</i>

13:03.074 --> 13:06.369
so they call it Downriver,
because it's down the river.

13:06.828 --> 13:09.247
<i>Growing up, I always didn't have a lot.</i>

13:09.497 --> 13:12.375
Never had things I wanted,
I had to work for them.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.877
<i>So, I put it in perspective</i>

13:14.961 --> 13:18.089
<i>that I have to work,
save my money, to get what I want.</i>

13:19.048 --> 13:22.135
<i>Well, I saved my money to be able
to get a house and my shop.</i>

13:22.552 --> 13:24.595
<i>I wanted my shop to be at home.</i>

13:36.691 --> 13:38.294
- <i>We met through friends.
- Friends.</i>

13:38.318 --> 13:42.238
And then, uh, we would just kind of start
hanging out after that,

13:42.322 --> 13:45.992
and decided that we liked each other,
and kind of made it a thing.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.453
And after that, where did you take me?

13:48.536 --> 13:50.747
I don't think you took me on a date
after that.

13:50.830 --> 13:51.956
- What?
- You didn't.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.624
- No.
- Where'd we go?

13:53.708 --> 13:55.585
You're on a date every day here.

13:55.668 --> 13:56.961
It's vacation.

13:57.795 --> 13:58.795
Yeah.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.003
<i>I appreciate that he's always
such a hard worker,</i>

14:09.057 --> 14:11.809
<i>so I will help him with whatever
he needs, and support him, and...</i>

14:11.934 --> 14:13.269
Move, baby girl.

14:13.436 --> 14:16.522
<i>...help him run everything around here,
and keep it all together, and...</i>

14:17.648 --> 14:20.026
I think we make a pretty
awesome team together.

14:20.526 --> 14:21.694
Olly!

14:22.111 --> 14:24.489
- What a bunch of turds.
- Bubba! Come here!

14:24.572 --> 14:25.573
Hey!

14:26.282 --> 14:27.658
Come on, Bubba!

14:28.201 --> 14:29.702
Hi!

14:30.328 --> 14:32.830
Come here! Come here!

14:35.208 --> 14:37.585
<i>I have a '94 GMC Sonoma.</i>

14:38.127 --> 14:41.339
<i>I built it about ten years ago,
and have been working on it since.</i>

14:41.964 --> 14:44.801
<i>It has a 3.8-liter Grand National motor
in it, twin turbo.</i>

14:44.884 --> 14:46.719
All Grand Nationals are single turbo.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.614
I wanted something different.
I went twin turbo.

14:48.638 --> 14:52.183
<i>It has a 400 trans manual valve body,
so you gotta shift it.</i>

14:52.266 --> 14:55.103
<i>The motor makes about 14,
1,500 horsepower.</i>

14:55.353 --> 14:56.793
<i>It used to be an eight-second truck.</i>

14:56.896 --> 14:58.776
<i>And I built the truck
to drive it on the street.</i>

14:59.857 --> 15:02.026
<i>I think you should be able
to drive a sleeper car.</i>

15:02.151 --> 15:05.238
If you don't drive your sleeper car
around, it's not a sleeper car,

15:05.321 --> 15:06.614
it's a race car.

15:09.200 --> 15:11.077
<i>Everybody I take for a ride,
they're like...</i>

15:11.202 --> 15:14.247
One person, they, like, blacked out.
People hold their breath,

15:14.330 --> 15:16.833
people try to grab me,
and I'll smack 'em out of the way.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.501
<i>Like, people get scared.</i>

15:18.584 --> 15:20.211
<i>One of my sayings is,</i>

15:20.420 --> 15:22.701
<i>"If I put 100 dollars
on my dashboard and you can grab it,</i>

15:22.797 --> 15:24.877
<i>you can keep it,
but you gotta wait until I take off.</i>

15:25.133 --> 15:27.885
So, sure as shit, they can't move.
It's like G-force.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.273
I mean, I've gone to the track
with him plenty of times,

15:40.398 --> 15:43.109
and I've seen little oops,
where we're running into walls or stuff.

15:43.234 --> 15:46.404
But, I mean, I have confidence
that he knows what he's doing,

15:46.487 --> 15:49.657
<i>and how to control a car,
and he has really fast reflexes</i>

15:49.740 --> 15:52.535
<i>to where if something were to happen,
he can correct it easily.</i>

15:52.618 --> 15:56.372
But there are always
that sense of nervousness

15:56.539 --> 15:59.459
when you're getting into a car
that's going 150 miles an hour

15:59.542 --> 16:01.294
for a quarter-mile, you know?

16:02.336 --> 16:03.754
Oh, God!

16:03.838 --> 16:07.383
Cabana!

16:10.887 --> 16:13.574
- Stop. You think you're gonna win?
- Oh, yeah, I'm gonna win.

16:13.598 --> 16:15.808
- You're gonna win for sure.
- Losing's not an option.

16:15.892 --> 16:17.351
Winning's... We're gonna win.

16:24.275 --> 16:25.568
Get this hooked up...

16:25.651 --> 16:27.069
- Oh.
- Turn the key on.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.033
- We'll get it powered up.
- All right.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.049
- And then we'll...
- I ain't seen one like that one, Bruce.

16:31.073 --> 16:34.118
Yeah, this is old school
for sure. Real old school.

16:34.619 --> 16:36.996
<i>Bruce is a mentor,</i>

16:37.497 --> 16:39.916
<i>a real laid-back guy.</i>

16:39.999 --> 16:44.045
<i>We started our relationship as a customer
and grew into a friendship.</i>

16:44.420 --> 16:48.216
He... This is somebody, you know,
that I'm real proud to call a friend.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.593
You know
what I'm gonna be racing Saturday?

16:50.676 --> 16:53.262
- No, what are you gonna race?
- Take... Take a guess.

16:53.638 --> 16:56.557
- What kind of supercar, you think?
- Lambo, maybe?

16:56.641 --> 16:58.768
- No.
- Not a Bugatti, I hope.

16:58.935 --> 17:01.145
No, I'm glad. I'm glad.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.022
- No Bugattis.
- No Bugattis.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.648
- Ferrari?
- Nope.

17:04.732 --> 17:05.816
That's all of them.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.484
- McLaren.
- Oh, boy.

17:09.487 --> 17:11.298
How fast are they?
What kind of power they make?

17:11.321 --> 17:13.156
Let me see. All right.

17:13.406 --> 17:17.537
Mc... McLaren.
Okay, quarter-mile, 11.0.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.205
- Okay, that's pretty fast.
- Right, yeah.

17:20.330 --> 17:22.583
<i>A win for me and my team,</i>

17:22.666 --> 17:25.086
<i>it'd be a real big
accomplishment for me.</i>

17:25.169 --> 17:28.839
It's something, you know, I could show
my kids one day when they get older.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.050
Come on. Oh!

17:31.467 --> 17:32.927
You're gonna beat Daddy!

17:33.219 --> 17:36.055
Oh. Stand up, let me see you stand up.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.433
Do your tricks, go. Come on.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.019
<i>I have three kids.</i>

17:42.311 --> 17:46.232
<i>My girls, they have no interest
in cars whatsoever.</i>

17:46.941 --> 17:49.610
<i>But Marco, he likes it. He likes it.</i>

17:49.694 --> 17:52.780
<i>So, yeah, I'm passing
the Grand National down to my son.</i>

17:53.823 --> 17:55.783
<i>I'm never selling that car, ever.</i>

17:55.908 --> 17:58.202
<i>'Cause he know that's gonna be his,
he always say,</i>

17:58.286 --> 18:00.788
<i>"Daddy, what you out there doing,
working on my black car?"</i>

18:00.955 --> 18:02.164
<i>And I'll say, "Yep."</i>

18:03.249 --> 18:07.628
<i>Soon as he gets probably 14,
he'll be able to drive on the track</i>

18:07.712 --> 18:10.298
<i>and stuff like that
with some special training and stuff,</i>

18:10.381 --> 18:12.925
so, I might have to go get me
another one and stuff,

18:13.134 --> 18:16.345
'cause he's like,
"Uh-uh, Dad, watch it. This mine."

18:17.638 --> 18:20.516
<i>He's gonna love hearing
his National beat a supercar.</i>

18:34.155 --> 18:35.781
Dave, what car are we racing?

18:36.032 --> 18:41.078
Well, I've never seen one live,
but I think that it's a McLaren MP4.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.123
- A McLaren?
- It's got about 600 plus horsepower

18:43.205 --> 18:44.707
and six speeds.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.418
- All-wheel drive?
- It's a V8, rear-wheel drive.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.503
Okay. How fast are those cars?

18:50.087 --> 18:53.466
Two hundred mile an hour top speed,
but we're going quarter-mile from a dig.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.968
Right. Doesn't sound big enough
to have a bed in the back.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.516
<i>With me having an extra 500 pounds</i>

19:02.933 --> 19:07.396
<i>and a major disadvantage
in the aerodynamics department,</i>

19:07.605 --> 19:10.608
<i>you know, a little bit of nitrous
might be what I need.</i>

19:13.027 --> 19:16.739
<i>Most people run like a five
or ten-pound bottle.</i>

19:17.865 --> 19:19.909
<i>But I run a 30-pound bottle.</i>

19:23.329 --> 19:26.290
<i>I like it, because the bottle pressure
stays a lot steadier,</i>

19:26.374 --> 19:28.376
<i>and you don't got
to fill your nitrous as often.</i>

19:28.626 --> 19:32.463
<i>So, I'm like the only one I know
that runs a bottle this big.</i>

19:32.880 --> 19:33.880
It just got heavier.

19:34.757 --> 19:37.718
So, if bottles are for babies,
I'm a big baby.

19:39.220 --> 19:44.266
<i>Nitrous is a major power adder,
so are turbos, so are superchargers.</i>

19:44.475 --> 19:46.811
There's a place in this world for nitrous,

19:46.894 --> 19:49.563
'cause nitrous can double
the horsepower of an engine.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.314
So, it's gonna be you,
a supercar, and two other...

19:52.525 --> 19:54.318
- Sleeper cars.
- That's interesting.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.697
- One quarter-of-a-million-dollar car
- That's a hell of a track.

19:57.780 --> 20:01.742
racing three... yo-yos like myself
from the street.

20:01.826 --> 20:02.952
I don't know.

20:04.995 --> 20:07.456
<i>McLaren MP4, 616 horsepower,</i>

20:07.540 --> 20:09.583
<i>thirty-two hundred,
it's about the same weight.</i>

20:09.667 --> 20:12.837
What's the quarter-mile time
on that McLaren? See what it says.

20:12.920 --> 20:17.508
McLaren MP4, 12C, 11.1 at 129.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.403
- They go 129...
- If it's stock...

20:19.427 --> 20:21.595
Listen, 129, that's a 10.40...

20:21.679 --> 20:23.699
- That's ten... 10.50, yeah.
- But it's never gonna...

20:23.723 --> 20:25.803
- If it ever hooks.
- Yeah, if it ever hooks.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.229
Here you go.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.639
<i>Me and my buddies started working
on the truck...</i>

20:34.734 --> 20:36.944
<i>to get it in peak performance
for the race.</i>

20:38.320 --> 20:41.365
<i>But then one thing after another
started going wrong.</i>

20:43.325 --> 20:44.325
Yeah.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.288
It's doing that double flash shit again.

20:47.705 --> 20:49.957
There's not even any kind
of spark or anything.

20:54.712 --> 20:56.964
- Where you at? Here.
- Twenty-five past.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.696
- Is that 25...
- No, before.

20:59.842 --> 21:02.052
<i>We took it apart
and put it back together,</i>

21:02.136 --> 21:04.221
<i>but the motor
still just wouldn't fire right.</i>

21:04.764 --> 21:06.032
- You ready?
- The coil's bad.

21:06.056 --> 21:07.516
- Yeah.
- Pay attention.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.316
We're gonna make this thing run.
I feel it coming.

21:15.399 --> 21:18.319
I hope so, man. I need fresh enthusiasm,

21:18.527 --> 21:20.237
'cause I'm all enthusiasm out.

21:23.532 --> 21:26.076
<i>You know, I'm very fortunate
to end up where I am.</i>

21:27.077 --> 21:29.163
A lot of the people we used
to hang out with ended up

21:29.288 --> 21:30.831
either addicted to drugs or in jail.

21:37.087 --> 21:41.759
<i>But, you know, a lot of it...
is not really based on luck, you know?</i>

21:41.842 --> 21:47.348
I attribute what one accomplishes
to one's level of preparedness.

22:00.778 --> 22:02.947
Aaron Bambach, track manager here at M1.

22:06.784 --> 22:09.703
So the plan is,
drag radials on the back,

22:10.037 --> 22:13.833
about 20 PSI in the tires, use
the launch control, good reaction time.

22:13.916 --> 22:16.710
And hopefully get an outside lane,
so if somebody goes squirrelly,

22:16.794 --> 22:18.003
- they don't hit me.
- Right.

22:22.591 --> 22:25.761
Rotation is correct here.
Still got the stickers on.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.471
We'll burn them off later, right?

22:29.348 --> 22:35.020
It's bad luck to peel the stickers off
brand-new tires on race cars.

22:36.146 --> 22:39.483
It's, uh, tradition to burn

22:39.984 --> 22:43.487
the stickers off doing a burnout.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.285
<i>I want a fighting chance here.</i>

22:49.368 --> 22:53.664
I don't want to go out there and,
you know, look stupid or something.

22:53.747 --> 22:55.624
So, I spent the extra few bucks,

22:55.875 --> 22:59.169
<i>and bought a set of the latest,
greatest drag radials.</i>

22:59.378 --> 23:03.215
And this should be the tire that I need
to do what we're gonna do this week.

23:22.109 --> 23:23.879
- Are you ready for this race?
- Yeah.

23:23.903 --> 23:26.989
I'm ready for it. I'm ready.
Well, me and Bruce, we about to get ready.

23:27.072 --> 23:30.492
We still got a little bit of work,
you know? We got some dialing in to do.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.012
- Take no prisoners.
- Rock out.

23:32.036 --> 23:34.622
Take no prisoners.
We gonna make the Natty do what it do.

23:34.997 --> 23:36.999
- G-Bodies forever.
- Yeah, for sure.

23:37.124 --> 23:40.085
G-Bodies or nobodies, for real.

23:40.878 --> 23:42.856
It's just more difficult
to find parts for these cars,

23:42.880 --> 23:45.674
<i>just because there's just fewer
and fewer of them every year.</i>

23:46.508 --> 23:49.637
<i>So, to find spare parts are
very difficult.</i>

23:50.054 --> 23:52.640
<i>I do have a collection
of 30 years of parts,</i>

23:53.057 --> 23:55.434
<i>so, I kind of went into my stash
of parts and found</i>

23:55.517 --> 23:57.811
<i>what we needed to get the job done.</i>

24:01.315 --> 24:04.276
To get ready for the race, we're gonna
switch it from the 93-octane chip

24:05.069 --> 24:08.280
to the 110-octane chip,
so we get more boost, more timing,

24:08.405 --> 24:10.699
more fuel, and make the car faster.

24:17.915 --> 24:20.250
<i>We're gonna take the car out later
and turn up the boost.</i>

24:20.334 --> 24:21.669
We're gonna unlock the knob,

24:22.169 --> 24:25.172
and then we're gonna turn it to the right
to increase spring pressure.

24:25.255 --> 24:27.466
When we get to the desired boost
at wide-open throttle,

24:27.758 --> 24:31.679
we'll lock it in, so Cedric doesn't run
30 or 40 pounds of boost by accident.

24:31.887 --> 24:35.015
Experience. Experience trumps youth

24:35.516 --> 24:37.768
most of the time in drag racing.

24:38.018 --> 24:41.355
<i>Reputation is at stake,
'cause everybody gonna see this,</i>

24:41.647 --> 24:44.358
<i>and who wants to be known
as the guy that lost?</i>

24:44.441 --> 24:46.193
<i>That's your street cred and stuff.</i>

24:46.276 --> 24:50.280
That can really make or break
your reputation in the drag racing world.

24:50.906 --> 24:52.741
<i>I think the National will eat
those cars up.</i>

24:52.950 --> 24:54.660
<i>That's what it's built for, you know?</i>

24:54.743 --> 24:56.787
It's built for straight-line missiles.

24:56.912 --> 25:01.875
Them cars is built for highway,
ten miles, you know, stuff like that.

25:02.084 --> 25:05.045
<i>They're not built
to take off from a dead stop.</i>

25:05.421 --> 25:07.339
<i>Everybody know
what that black Regal do.</i>

25:07.423 --> 25:09.550
<i>Everybody know what it is around here.</i>

25:10.175 --> 25:13.762
I get respect and reverence
when I come around.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.868
Okay, it was running good before.
We need to get back to where it was.

25:18.892 --> 25:21.532
- Doesn't matter what the tune says.
- What are we gonna put it at?

25:22.229 --> 25:24.606
I don't know. Try and start it now,
and see what happens.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.237
Loosen that... Loosen the lock nut.

25:30.612 --> 25:32.865
Loosen up the lock nut
and give me the Allen wrench.

25:37.745 --> 25:39.145
Try it.

25:47.337 --> 25:49.131
Doesn't sound like it wants to run!

25:50.132 --> 25:51.609
- All right. All right.
- Bitch!

25:51.633 --> 25:53.319
That's okay. That's okay.
Just let it go.

25:53.343 --> 25:54.344
Damn it.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.847
- It's like a puzzle.
- Yep.

25:57.139 --> 26:00.934
It's been in this exact position since,
like, Saturday morning.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.620
- It's gonna run now.
- Friday night.

26:02.644 --> 26:04.146
It's gonna run today.

26:06.482 --> 26:09.943
It didn't move. It didn't move.
It's still five degrees after.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.404
Come on, baby.

26:13.197 --> 26:15.115
<i>The balancer has
a reluctor wheel on it,</i>

26:15.199 --> 26:16.992
<i>and the reluctor wheel controls
the timing.</i>

26:17.409 --> 26:19.161
We're unable to find the correct timing,

26:19.286 --> 26:21.622
<i>so we're hoping by changing the balancer,</i>

26:22.039 --> 26:25.501
<i>it'll change the timing, and hopefully
solve the issue we're having.</i>

26:25.959 --> 26:27.211
Can you, uh, bump it, John?

26:27.711 --> 26:29.505
- You want me to...
- Just slow, bump it.

26:30.380 --> 26:31.540
Bump it.

26:32.174 --> 26:34.551
Oh, that'll work.

26:38.180 --> 26:40.974
You know, that car pretty much
does everything for you, right?

26:41.058 --> 26:44.269
It has launch control,
it has the shift points.

26:44.436 --> 26:47.815
<i>You know, there's not really a way that
you can screw up the race in that car.</i>

26:47.898 --> 26:50.859
And I think we have a really good shot.
I'm not nervous at all.

26:52.361 --> 26:54.571
So, I'm gonna put this list
on the doghouse,

26:55.155 --> 26:58.700
and it's one of my last-minute things
I do before I race.

26:59.284 --> 27:01.036
And this will live right here.

27:01.370 --> 27:04.039
And that's my checklist,
before I floor this thing.

27:04.498 --> 27:07.000
If I don't pull the timing back,
you can blow up the engine.

27:14.466 --> 27:17.094
It sounds different.
It's doing something different.

27:18.220 --> 27:20.260
- I'm checking this reluctor, okay?
- Mm-hmm.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.349
Interesting.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.397
Finally, this baby starts!

27:28.730 --> 27:30.899
- It does run!
- Send it!

27:38.073 --> 27:40.659
I feel really excited
that my truck's running now,

27:40.784 --> 27:44.121
after all the hard work me and my buddies,
you know, have been putting in.

27:44.204 --> 27:47.249
I really appreciate all their help,
and we've done nothing

27:47.332 --> 27:49.918
but beat our heads against the wall,
working crazy hours.

27:50.043 --> 27:52.629
<i>But I feel really better now
that it's running and driving,</i>

27:52.713 --> 27:54.590
<i>so there's no stopping me now.</i>

28:09.271 --> 28:12.232
<i>I believe if I can hook
and get up out of there,</i>

28:12.316 --> 28:15.319
<i>you know, I believe I got
an excellent chance of winning.</i>

28:17.029 --> 28:18.989
Very nice. Beautiful car.

28:19.114 --> 28:20.675
- Thank you.
- A beast.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.510
I think this is Darth Vader's old car.

28:22.534 --> 28:25.374
- Right, right. Yeah.
- Very nice. Very nice.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.487
<i>I didn't sleep last night,
the day before the race.</i>

28:29.666 --> 28:33.837
<i>I probably put 130 hours into it myself,
in one week, seven days,</i>

28:33.962 --> 28:36.340
<i>not including all my friends
and family that's helped me.</i>

28:36.715 --> 28:37.715
<i>We got to win.</i>

28:39.301 --> 28:40.737
- How's it going?
- What's going on?

28:40.761 --> 28:42.137
- Ryan.
- Ced.

28:42.429 --> 28:44.014
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, sure.

28:44.097 --> 28:45.265
- Your car?
- Yep.

28:45.349 --> 28:47.184
Nice car. I love Grand Nationals.

28:47.267 --> 28:50.145
Right, yeah. Sounds like
you got a heartbeat goin' on.

28:50.437 --> 28:53.273
Yeah, it's not running right.
Been having nothing but problems.

28:53.482 --> 28:55.692
Yeah, they're very temperamental.

28:56.401 --> 28:57.681
But when they right, they right.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.739
- Well, one of us gotta win, V6 style.
- Right.

29:00.864 --> 29:02.241
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

29:07.454 --> 29:11.250
<i>Thinking about my Ma, you know?
Did I do everything right?</i>

29:11.833 --> 29:13.126
<i>Am I gonna do everything right?</i>

29:13.710 --> 29:16.672
<i>Drag racing's more
than just flooring a gas pedal.</i>

29:16.838 --> 29:19.234
- Jarvis, I know that guy.
- Yeah, I know him too.

29:19.258 --> 29:20.467
Seen him at the track.

29:22.010 --> 29:24.280
- What kind of tires he got on there?
- I don't know.

29:24.304 --> 29:25.806
It look like a full slate.

29:25.973 --> 29:28.100
- Smells like race gas, too.
- Yeah.

29:29.393 --> 29:30.394
You're good.

29:32.229 --> 29:33.772
All right. Ryan.

29:34.022 --> 29:36.024
- Dave Jarvis. My pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.318
- Damn, break my hand.
- Yeah, I got a good handshake.

29:38.402 --> 29:40.696
Easy, easy. Easy.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.781
- How are you? Dave Jarvis.
- Ced. Ced.

29:46.118 --> 29:49.037
- Oh, look. Look what we got here.
- Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Uh-uh.

29:49.121 --> 29:51.665
That's fancy. Let me drive that.

29:51.748 --> 29:53.834
- Here we go.
- I'll show him how to drive that.

29:53.917 --> 29:56.503
Hey, let's switch vehicles,
see who drives it faster.

29:56.586 --> 29:57.629
There we go.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.836
I'll tell you one thing,
I love that color.

30:00.257 --> 30:02.259
<i>I'm not nervous at all
about the drag race.</i>

30:02.342 --> 30:03.885
<i>The only thing that I'm nervous about</i>

30:03.969 --> 30:06.209
<i>is one of these guys going sideways
and smashing into me.</i>

30:06.263 --> 30:08.390
<i>That's the only thing
that I'm nervous about.</i>

30:11.893 --> 30:12.853
Good?

30:12.854 --> 30:15.053
- What's up, man?
- Hi, Dave Jarvis, my pleasure.

30:15.105 --> 30:16.666
Good to meet you. Which one's yours?

30:16.690 --> 30:17.816
- The van.
- Oh, yeah?

30:17.899 --> 30:19.026
- What's your name?
- Nick.

30:19.109 --> 30:21.462
- Nick, nice to meet you, man.
- I'm a little bit scared of that van.

30:21.486 --> 30:23.405
- Oh!
- You've got some big, fat tires there.

30:23.530 --> 30:25.008
- Great, man.
- That's a beat, huh?

30:25.032 --> 30:26.575
He just press a button and go.

30:28.785 --> 30:30.847
What do they call this,
a shaggin' wagon or what?

30:30.871 --> 30:33.099
- That's a name for it!
- The Mystery Machine.

30:33.123 --> 30:39.546
It's 418 cubic inch, all aluminum,
pump gas, small-block Chevy.

30:39.755 --> 30:41.214
How much power you putting down?

30:41.840 --> 30:45.135
- Uh, made 531. At the tire.
- At the wheel?

30:45.385 --> 30:46.970
That fucker's gonna be fast, dude.

30:47.054 --> 30:49.181
I already know. I don't think I'm...

30:49.264 --> 30:51.641
Well, it's heavy and it's not aerodynamic.

30:52.017 --> 30:53.745
<i>I think the van's got
a good advantage.</i>

30:53.769 --> 30:56.730
He's got a lot of weight, so a lot
of weight, when you transfer it,

30:56.813 --> 30:59.775
it actually hooks the tire.
So, I think he's got a good advantage.

30:59.983 --> 31:04.404
Engine fuel pump, nitrous fuel pump,
timing control right here.

31:05.405 --> 31:07.449
Ignition here. Ignition here.

31:07.616 --> 31:10.619
Decked out. You might have
more options than the McLaren.

31:10.744 --> 31:12.371
Yeah, maybe!

31:12.496 --> 31:15.248
- Let's check out this truck.
- Just a V6.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.894
- Twin turbo.
- Yes, you got two cylinders on me, though.

31:17.959 --> 31:19.044
Yeah.

31:19.127 --> 31:23.090
Those cars are fast. That guy's putting
down 800 horsepower to the wheel.

31:23.590 --> 31:26.176
It'll make 1,500,
but I didn't make it that today.

31:26.259 --> 31:28.553
- The motor's actually hurt.
- What do you mean?

31:28.845 --> 31:30.573
- It's got metal in the oil.
- Aw, man.

31:30.597 --> 31:31.807
- It's knocking.
- Really?

31:31.890 --> 31:33.534
- I just...
- Bring it over to the house.

31:33.558 --> 31:36.228
And then the van is putting down
510 to the rear wheel

31:36.311 --> 31:38.397
with a 275 shot of nitrous.

31:40.190 --> 31:42.109
Cedric, how much power
you putting down to that?

31:42.442 --> 31:45.987
Oh, man, a little bit more than stock.
Not much more.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.406
Come on, now.

31:47.489 --> 31:49.991
<i>But they have
the margin of driver error.</i>

31:50.117 --> 31:52.035
The driver has to drive those cars.

31:52.119 --> 31:54.287
Me, I can just be an idiot
and hit the button,

31:54.371 --> 31:56.224
you know what I mean?
For launch control and be gone.

31:56.248 --> 31:58.518
- Let me show you how to open the door.
- How do you do that?

31:58.542 --> 32:00.419
There's a motion sensor,
so you put it...

32:00.544 --> 32:03.189
- You put your hand over there?
- Like you're going up a woman's leg,

32:03.213 --> 32:05.494
- you know, to her butt. Just like that.
- This is Cheryl.

32:05.549 --> 32:07.509
- Hey, Cheryl. I'm Nick.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

32:07.592 --> 32:09.192
- Pleasure to meet you.
- You too.

32:10.345 --> 32:13.849
I love the McLaren.
That color is just out of sight,

32:13.932 --> 32:17.352
but I don't think he gonna do
very well today, you know?

32:17.519 --> 32:19.896
<i>I touched his tires,
and it's hard as hell.</i>

32:19.980 --> 32:23.316
Totally off for what we're trying to do,
which is hook and book.

32:23.608 --> 32:26.445
He gonna...
He gonna spin, I guarantee that.

32:26.695 --> 32:29.364
May we have the drivers here,
please? Drivers only.

32:36.663 --> 32:39.040
We're gonna give you each
an opportunity to walk the track

32:39.666 --> 32:41.668
<i>so that you can see
what the lanes look like,</i>

32:41.793 --> 32:44.129
<i>and you can decide
where you want to run your car.</i>

32:44.463 --> 32:46.298
Oh, look, there's a manhole cover.

32:47.841 --> 32:49.092
Detroit, dog!

32:52.721 --> 32:55.348
I don't think this makes too much
difference to me, to be honest.

32:55.640 --> 32:56.725
It's all the same.

32:57.309 --> 33:01.771
The race will start upon a signal
visible to all vehicles.

33:01.938 --> 33:03.523
That'll be these lights here.

33:03.773 --> 33:07.360
Vehicles will be allowed
one tire-warming run or burnout

33:07.527 --> 33:11.156
before the race in order to clean
and heat the tires, if so desired.

33:12.115 --> 33:14.451
I want to do a small burn.
Motor's getting noisier.

33:15.911 --> 33:18.830
<i>The winner of this race
will go on to the championship race</i>

33:19.080 --> 33:21.291
<i>in El Mirage dry lake bed.</i>

33:22.501 --> 33:24.794
<i>Anything can happen.
Anything can go wrong.</i>

33:25.170 --> 33:27.672
<i>Someone can crash.
Everybody can spin.</i>

33:28.048 --> 33:30.050
<i>One little thing goes wrong,
it can be ruined.</i>

33:30.383 --> 33:33.637
<i>If everything goes right,
I think my van's gonna fly.</i>

33:35.388 --> 33:37.108
<i>When you get up
to the starting line,</i>

33:37.390 --> 33:38.934
<i>everything goes slow motion.</i>

33:39.726 --> 33:41.937
<i>Once you let go
and go down the track, it's fun.</i>

33:44.147 --> 33:46.441
<i>Trying to savor
the moment right now.</i>

33:47.150 --> 33:50.278
<i>All the hard work
and the sleepless nights,</i>

33:51.321 --> 33:53.281
<i>it's coming all to a head.</i>

33:55.450 --> 33:57.619
<i>It's been a long 24 hours, man.</i>

33:58.036 --> 34:00.556
<i>I didn't sleep, and I had a young lady
stay the night last night,</i>

34:00.580 --> 34:02.415
<i>and just... I'm burning it at both ends.</i>

34:02.749 --> 34:04.918
<i>So it's a good thing
I just have to push a button.</i>

34:13.092 --> 34:16.429
I think I got to drive over ten miles
an hour to get the launch mode active.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.598
- You can back up and go over ten...
- Okay.

34:18.723 --> 34:20.141
- ...to get it, yeah.
- All right.

34:25.105 --> 34:26.856
The rules stated, break the tires,

34:26.940 --> 34:28.858
rotate the tires,
it's considered as a burnout.

34:29.025 --> 34:30.985
Supercar, number one,
did his burnout.

34:32.279 --> 34:33.862
Fuck is going on here?

34:34.739 --> 34:36.509
- Are you good?
- I don't know, man.

34:36.533 --> 34:38.451
All right, you're done. Go.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.471
<i>So then this guy, well,
I'm looking at him.</i>

34:40.495 --> 34:43.534
<i>I'm on the brake so I don't roll forward.
Waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting.</i>

34:44.541 --> 34:47.181
Like I said, I want to do
the burnout a foot from that line.

34:48.003 --> 34:49.670
Well, you gotta go!
Let's go, let's go!

34:49.754 --> 34:51.380
How much water you want down?

34:51.840 --> 34:54.509
- Whole thing? Half?
- We gotta go!

34:54.592 --> 34:56.177
- Not even.
- Not even.

34:57.012 --> 34:58.680
<i>These guys pour the water</i>

34:58.930 --> 35:00.849
<i>where they're gonna leave,
at the starting line.</i>

35:00.932 --> 35:02.692
<i>He did that,
and I already knew he fucked up.</i>

35:04.519 --> 35:05.645
Goddamnit.

35:07.689 --> 35:09.983
Did you see what they did?
He's leaving in water.

35:10.942 --> 35:12.837
He's done. That's it.
That's your burnout.

35:12.861 --> 35:15.655
- Aw, fuck!
- They're saying one and done, that's it.

35:15.822 --> 35:17.324
Come on, man!

35:18.241 --> 35:19.784
Oh, he's fucked.

35:20.493 --> 35:23.538
- Now you're sitting in water.
- Fuck that!

35:24.039 --> 35:26.058
- What you gonna do?
- Cars are getting hot.

35:26.082 --> 35:27.417
Bullshit!

35:28.168 --> 35:30.253
<i>I do my burnout.
Little burnout.</i>

35:34.424 --> 35:35.759
<i>So then, Grand National guy...</i>

35:36.301 --> 35:38.511
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

35:38.720 --> 35:40.656
<i>...attempts to do a burnout,
does a little burnout.</i>

35:42.724 --> 35:45.727
<i>Everybody backs up. I'm sitting
there, sitting there, sitting there.</i>

35:45.810 --> 35:48.396
If I pull up to the line,
am I still in the water?

35:48.563 --> 35:50.440
- Yeah.
- Come on, what the fuck?

35:50.523 --> 35:52.400
<i>I'm ready to race.
What is going on?</i>

36:00.909 --> 36:01.909
What?

36:01.993 --> 36:03.679
I don't know how he got
to do another burnout,

36:03.703 --> 36:05.205
but that was not part of the rules.

36:07.040 --> 36:09.250
<i>So, all of a sudden,
people start doing more burnouts.</i>

36:12.671 --> 36:14.991
<i>And then I was sitting there
for ten minutes, it felt like.</i>

36:15.090 --> 36:17.276
<i>Racing, you don't do that.
Race cars, you cannot do that,</i>

36:17.300 --> 36:20.261
<i>'cause your engine could overheat.
I mean, I'm getting burned down here.</i>

36:20.720 --> 36:23.306
Come on, you gotta go!
We gotta go! Off, no more.

36:23.390 --> 36:25.433
We gotta go! Come on up. Come on up.

36:40.615 --> 36:41.741
Damn it.

36:50.291 --> 36:53.002
Fucking son of a bitch.

37:01.219 --> 37:04.389
What the fuck was the one burnout?
That's two burnouts!

37:19.195 --> 37:20.363
Man!

37:22.615 --> 37:25.076
Was sitting here waiting
for 20 fucking minutes!

37:29.372 --> 37:30.372
That's bullshit!

37:31.040 --> 37:33.835
- That's fucking bullshit!
- ...piece of shit now!

37:34.502 --> 37:35.879
Fucking morons!

37:36.379 --> 37:38.590
Fucking sitting here
running all fucking day.

37:38.673 --> 37:39.841
Let me see this motherfucker.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.635
That's fucking bullshit!

37:43.720 --> 37:45.555
<i>They're all probably fucking scared,</i>

37:45.638 --> 37:48.278
<i>fuckin' want to burn me fucking down,
that's some fucking bullshit!</i>

37:48.433 --> 37:51.186
Take this shit to the street,
motherfuckers get shot!

37:55.440 --> 38:00.153
Two fucking weeks nonstop,
we haven't slept in fucking 40 hours!

38:00.236 --> 38:04.240
Hey, what the fuck was that?
One burnout! One fucking burnout!

38:04.324 --> 38:06.844
- You're gonna yell at me?
- Yeah, I'm gonna fucking yell at you.

38:06.868 --> 38:09.496
The rules were for six months,
one burnout.

38:09.579 --> 38:12.373
- I didn't get a burnout.
- Bullshit! You spun the tires!

38:12.457 --> 38:14.876
They said break the tires,
that was one burnout!

38:14.959 --> 38:16.759
You dumb motherfuckers
put the water in there.

38:16.836 --> 38:18.773
- Don't call me names.
- Hey, I don't give a fuck!

38:18.797 --> 38:19.877
- What you gonna do?
- I do.

38:19.964 --> 38:22.151
I'm repping Detroit!
What the fuck you wanna do about it?

38:22.175 --> 38:24.969
I don't give a fuck!
The rules were one fucking burnout!

38:25.386 --> 38:28.026
You're sitting there burning me down,
that's some fucking bullshit!

38:28.097 --> 38:30.657
- I didn't burn anybody down.
- Bullshit! Go to the fucking reel.

38:30.725 --> 38:33.144
He ended up cooking his motor,
and then everybody went.

38:33.353 --> 38:36.481
Get the fuck out of here.
Go to real Detroit street racing.

38:36.564 --> 38:39.192
- Right now? Right now?
- Yeah, let's fucking go, motherfucker.

38:39.692 --> 38:41.402
It's what you get for racing in Detroit.

38:42.278 --> 38:44.989
- I know you're mad.
- I've been working my dick off on this.

38:45.156 --> 38:46.836
I know. I know. And it's okay.

38:46.866 --> 38:48.868
But it's just supposed
to be a fun race and...

38:49.118 --> 38:51.788
- It doesn't matter. They cheated.
- Okay, we can accept that.

38:51.871 --> 38:54.016
- Can you get me a water?
- Can you stop screaming for me?

38:54.040 --> 38:55.792
Yeah, can you get me
a water, please? Yes.

38:55.875 --> 38:58.062
- Can you calm down? Promise me?
- Please, get me a water.

38:58.086 --> 39:00.421
Oh, man, that flew off the handle, boy.

39:00.713 --> 39:02.173
Shit.

39:02.674 --> 39:03.925
- It happens.
- Yeah.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.228
Okay, guys, so...

39:15.854 --> 39:19.190
Unfortunately, that race didn't go
exactly as we planned.

39:19.732 --> 39:21.609
So we're gonna talk
about that a little bit.

39:21.818 --> 39:25.280
And then we also have
what we feel is a resolution

39:25.613 --> 39:28.783
and a situation that will work
for everybody involved, okay?

39:29.033 --> 39:32.495
So, we got to the line, and Dave,
even though the rules said

39:32.620 --> 39:34.706
one burnout, you took two burnouts.

39:34.789 --> 39:37.000
Nick, you took two burnouts
when originally it was one.

39:37.166 --> 39:39.686
The rules were broken,
and the rules shouldn't have been broken.

39:39.752 --> 39:40.962
We all agreed on something.

39:41.045 --> 39:43.245
- You're absolutely right. Yeah.
- You know what I mean?

39:43.298 --> 39:47.218
So, Dave, unfortunately, you had
two burnouts, so you're disqualified.

39:47.969 --> 39:50.805
Nick, same thing. A disqualification
is a disqualification.

39:51.598 --> 39:54.078
It's honestly... It's a shame,
'cause you got some really fast,

39:54.142 --> 39:56.622
really powerful cars out here,
and I'd hoped for a better race.

39:57.020 --> 40:00.481
It was the greatest day
of my life, and now it's the worst.

40:02.525 --> 40:03.526
Man.

40:03.651 --> 40:05.403
Two people followed the rules.

40:05.653 --> 40:08.323
So, what we're gonna do,
what we think the fairest thing to do,

40:08.448 --> 40:11.951
is have a runoff between Ryan and Cedric

40:12.201 --> 40:14.401
<i>at a place to be determined
and a time to be determined.</i>

40:14.871 --> 40:18.166
<i>And the winner of that race
will get to go on to the finals</i>

40:18.458 --> 40:21.294
<i>at the dry lake bed
at El Mirage, California.</i>

40:24.714 --> 40:26.154
<i>I'm feeling real confident.</i>

40:26.215 --> 40:28.676
<i>I know my car's gonna do
what it's gonna do, you know?</i>

40:28.760 --> 40:30.219
<i>I know it's gonna perform, so...</i>

40:31.429 --> 40:34.057
<i>I'm ready to get it done.
I'm ready to drive. That's what I do.</i>

40:36.309 --> 40:37.745
- All right.
- Good to see you again.

40:37.769 --> 40:39.413
- Good to see you.
- Thanks for coming back out.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.522
<i>It's a rematch,
I hope everything goes clean.</i>

40:41.606 --> 40:44.025
<i>I want a good, fair race, you know?
I want to win.</i>

40:44.359 --> 40:45.860
<i>I put in a lot of work, time, money,</i>

40:45.985 --> 40:47.785
<i>and so has my friends,
family, everybody else.</i>

40:47.862 --> 40:49.322
<i>So, I want to represent Detroit.</i>

40:50.239 --> 40:52.051
- Good to see you.
- What's up?

40:52.075 --> 40:53.201
Thanks for coming back out.

40:53.326 --> 40:55.206
- Good to see you again.
- Thank you. I'm tired.

40:56.788 --> 40:57.789
Easy.

40:59.165 --> 41:01.793
<i>The motor obviously broke last time,</i>

41:01.876 --> 41:03.878
<i>so I'm saving it for the race.</i>

41:04.545 --> 41:06.345
<i>When I see a lot
of pushing around...</i>

41:06.381 --> 41:11.010
You know, is that a testament to,
you know, how it's gonna run and stuff?

41:11.260 --> 41:13.596
<i>Well, hopefully,
that'll work out in my favor.</i>

41:13.721 --> 41:15.556
- What's up, bro? You all right?
- Yeah.

41:15.765 --> 41:17.767
Haven't got able,
a chance to test it or anything.

41:17.850 --> 41:20.120
- Right, right, right.
- So, it ain't running right, so...

41:20.144 --> 41:21.604
Right.

41:26.567 --> 41:28.611
<i>You gotta be
completely composed,</i>

41:28.778 --> 41:31.364
<i>focused in your vehicle,
you know, at the starting line.</i>

41:31.489 --> 41:34.742
<i>You mess up, and that's how
people win races, or you lose races.</i>

41:38.162 --> 41:41.165
<i>When I pull up to the burnout box
and do my burnout,</i>

41:41.290 --> 41:43.042
<i>I always think about </i> Top Gun.

41:43.459 --> 41:46.337
<i>Like I'm about to get launched off
the aircraft carrier.</i>

41:47.922 --> 41:49.882
<i>I've got a little bit of nerves going,</i>

41:49.966 --> 41:53.678
<i>but I'm extremely focused,
extremely confident,</i>

41:53.761 --> 41:57.306
<i>and, you know,
I'm just ready for lift-off.</i>

42:03.646 --> 42:05.440
- You good?
- Okay!

42:20.455 --> 42:21.914
Okay, okay!

42:27.587 --> 42:32.133
Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay!

42:35.303 --> 42:36.888
- Woo!
<i>- Okay!</i>

42:36.971 --> 42:39.241
- <i>We got a race. Thank you.
- That was side-by-side...</i>

42:39.265 --> 42:40.576
<i>Thank you. We got a race.</i>

42:40.600 --> 42:42.077
<i>That's a race. That's a race.</i>

42:42.101 --> 42:44.395
- <i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>
- Damn it.

42:46.981 --> 42:48.816
Good race, gentlemen.
Good race. Good race.

42:49.650 --> 42:53.321
<i>I jumped out on about half a car,
and I actually held him there</i>

42:53.571 --> 42:56.657
<i>till probably about 75 percent
of the way down.</i>

42:56.741 --> 42:59.744
<i>I think third gear,
he started to come back around.</i>

43:00.119 --> 43:02.765
<i>I pulled up in front of him,
and I was looking in the mirror.</i>

43:02.789 --> 43:04.290
<i>And I actually grabbed third gear,</i>

43:04.415 --> 43:06.769
<i>and it started...
My motor started to break up a little bit.</i>

43:06.793 --> 43:09.087
<i>But I couldn't see him behind me
in my mirror,</i>

43:09.212 --> 43:11.881
<i>so I knew he was right next to me.
So it was a pretty close race.</i>

43:20.098 --> 43:21.599
- How's it going?
- Yeah.

43:21.849 --> 43:23.289
Okay, let's bring it in.

43:23.726 --> 43:26.145
- Both clean starts. You were the winner.
- Cool.

43:26.229 --> 43:29.941
So you'll be moving on to the dry
lake bed in El Mirage, California.

43:30.024 --> 43:32.902
So, thank you very much for that.
Thank you very much.

43:33.319 --> 43:36.239
A lot of highs and lows,
a lot of sleepless nights,

43:36.322 --> 43:39.826
and busted knuckles
and girlfriends or wives

43:39.909 --> 43:43.412
being mad 'cause you ain't
at home and stuff, but, you know...

43:46.207 --> 43:48.459
I want to thank
my friends and family.

43:48.709 --> 43:50.749
My girlfriend that puts up with me...

43:51.629 --> 43:54.924
In the barn, 24 hours a day, you know?

43:55.007 --> 43:58.052
She's like, "What are you doing down
there?" So, I want to thank everybody.

43:58.636 --> 44:00.847
I won this race today
and I'm going to move forward

44:00.930 --> 44:03.099
to California to race
on a dry lake bed.

44:03.432 --> 44:06.435
<i>I've never done that before,
and I got to do a lot of work</i>

44:06.519 --> 44:09.021
in a short period of time
to get ready for this race

44:09.105 --> 44:11.732
and I only have a couple weeks,
and it's gonna be fun.

44:11.899 --> 44:15.319
All the ups and downs, and the fighting
and the bickering and stuff,

44:15.403 --> 44:17.780
you know, yeah,
all that's behind us now, you know?

44:18.030 --> 44:21.868
<i>'Cause we all was warriors
on the drag strip,</i>

44:21.993 --> 44:24.120
<i>and we all fought and battled,</i>

44:24.203 --> 44:26.706
<i>and we all had our own cars
that we was fighting with.</i>

44:26.789 --> 44:30.543
<i>So, we was living the same thing,
even though we was competitors and stuff.</i>

44:30.626 --> 44:34.547
So, you know, all that stuff that happened
before, man, that's in the past.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.549
You know,
we won't even think about that.
