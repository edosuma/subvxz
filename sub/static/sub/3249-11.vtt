if you ever need me out of your hair,
just give me a shout, OK?

(STRANGE NOISES SUBSIDE)

13:05.520 --> 13:08.879
It's stopped...ish!

13:08.960 --> 13:12.559
- How about your end?
- My end's good.

13:12.640 --> 13:17.079
So, doesn't sound great,
but nothing to worry about?

13:17.160 --> 13:19.679
No, no, no, not really.
Just keep the zigzag plotter on full,

13:19.760 --> 13:21.399
that'll protect you.

13:23.960 --> 13:25.279
Argh!

13:25.360 --> 13:28.599
- Amy, I said the zigzag plotter!
- I pulled the zigzag plotter!

13:28.680 --> 13:31.199
- You've got the door behind you?
- Yes!

13:31.280 --> 13:34.559
OK, take two steps to your right
and pull it again!

13:42.480 --> 13:44.359
- (ENGINE NOISE NORMAL)
- Oh.

13:44.440 --> 13:47.559
Now, I must not use the sonic.
I've got work to do,

13:47.640 --> 13:49.759
- need to pick up a few items.
- Hey!

13:51.960 --> 13:55.799
- (CAT MIAOWING)
- Ssh!

13:58.080 --> 14:00.239
Don't get comfortable.

(THE DOCTOR SINGS NONSENSE TO TUNE OF:

14:11.600 --> 14:14.399
- Doctor!
- Hello?

14:14.520 --> 14:18.839
- How long are you going to be in there?
- Oh, sorry, I like a good soak!

14:19.840 --> 14:22.119
(LOUD THUMPING)

14:22.200 --> 14:24.679
- What the hell was that?
- What did you say?

14:26.440 --> 14:29.639
I'm just going to go upstairs,
see if he's OK.

14:29.720 --> 14:31.239
Sorry?

14:43.840 --> 14:45.119
What did you say?

14:51.480 --> 14:54.199
- ELDERLY MAN: Yes? Hello?
- Craig?

14:55.600 --> 14:56.759
Ow!

14:56.840 --> 15:00.359
It's me from downstairs.
I heard a big bang.

15:02.040 --> 15:04.119
No choice...it's sonicing time.

15:05.160 --> 15:08.039
Thank you, Craig,
but I don't need your help.

15:10.920 --> 15:12.079
Oops!

15:13.280 --> 15:16.319
- What happened, what's going on?
- Is that my toothbrush?

15:16.400 --> 15:18.839
- Correct. You spoke to the man upstairs?
- Yeah.

15:18.920 --> 15:19.959
What did he look like?

15:20.040 --> 15:21.879
More normal than you do
at the moment, mate.

15:21.960 --> 15:24.559
- What are you doing?
- I thought you might be in trouble.

15:24.680 --> 15:29.119
(LAUGHING) Thanks(!) Well if I ever am,
you can come and save me

15:29.200 --> 15:32.759
- with my toothbrush.

- Wah!

Hello! The Doctor.

15:44.640 --> 15:47.439
- Oh. Right.
- Er...you must be Sophie.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.919
Mm-hm.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.239
Oh...oh!

15:52.320 --> 15:55.839
No, Dom's in Malta, there's nobody around.
Hang on a sec.

15:55.920 --> 16:00.039
We've got a match today, pub league,
we're one down if you fancy it.

16:00.120 --> 16:01.879
Pub league? A drinking competition?

16:03.080 --> 16:06.639
- No...football...play football?
- Football!

16:06.720 --> 16:09.479
Yes, blokes play football!
I'm good at football, I think.

16:09.600 --> 16:12.919
You've saved my life! ...I've got
somebody. All right, see you down there.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.439
Hey, Soph.

16:14.520 --> 16:16.879
Hey, I thought I'd come early
and meet your new flatmate.

16:16.960 --> 16:19.119
Do you play, Sophie?

16:19.200 --> 16:22.559
No, Soph just stands
on the sidelines. She's my mascot.

16:22.640 --> 16:24.959
I'm your mascot? Mascot?!

16:25.040 --> 16:28.399
Well, not my mascot. It's a football
match, I can't take a date.

16:28.480 --> 16:31.439
- I didn't say I was your date.
- Neither did I.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.119
Better get dressed.

16:40.640 --> 16:43.999
Oh, spare kit's just in the bottom drawer.

16:44.080 --> 16:45.199
Bit of a mess.

16:47.400 --> 16:50.279
- What do you think?
- You didn't say he was gorgeous!

16:50.360 --> 16:53.199
You unlocked the door. How did
you do that? Those are your keys.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.239
You must have left them
last time you came here.

16:55.320 --> 16:58.759
Yeah, but I...
How do you know these are my keys?

16:58.840 --> 17:01.079
- I've been holding them.
- I have got another set.

17:01.160 --> 17:02.439
You've got two sets of keys

17:02.520 --> 17:04.119
- to someone else's house?
- Yeah.

17:04.200 --> 17:05.479
I see.

17:05.560 --> 17:07.959
You must like it here too.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.799
So I'm going out.
If I hang about the house all the time,

17:22.880 --> 17:26.439
him upstairs might get suspicious,
notice me.

17:26.520 --> 17:29.359
Football. OK, well done.
That is normal.

17:29.440 --> 17:31.839
Yeah, football, all outdoorsy.

17:31.920 --> 17:35.559
Now, football's the one
with the sticks, isn't it?

17:35.800 --> 17:38.519
What are you actually called,
what's your proper name?

17:38.600 --> 17:40.079
- Just call me the Doctor.
- Yeah.

17:40.120 --> 17:43.399
I can't say to these guys, "Hey, this is
my new flatmate, he's called the Doctor."

17:43.480 --> 17:44.759
- Why not?
- Cos it's weird.

17:44.840 --> 17:46.479
- All right, Craig?
- Hey!

17:46.560 --> 17:48.439
- Hey.
- Soph. All right, mate?

17:50.000 --> 17:51.919
Hello, I'm Craig's new flatmate.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.839
- I'm called the Doctor.
- All right, Doctor. I'm Sean.

17:54.920 --> 17:57.039
- Where are you strongest?
- Arms.

17:58.240 --> 18:01.759
No, he means
what position on the field?

18:01.840 --> 18:04.439
Not sure. The front? The side?

18:04.520 --> 18:08.199
- Below?
- Are you any good, though?

Yes. Go!

- Yes.

18:48.680 --> 18:51.439

show them what you've got!

Next week we've got the Crown and Anchor.
We'll annihilate them!

20:19.880 --> 20:22.119
No violence, do you understand me?
Not while I'm around,

20:22.200 --> 20:24.759
not today, not ever.
I'm the Doctor, the oncoming storm...

20:24.840 --> 20:27.399
and you meant beat them
in a football match, didn't you?

20:27.480 --> 20:30.519
- Yeah.
- Lovely. What sort of time?

- It's happening again - worse!
- What does the scanner say?

20:57.960 --> 20:59.919
A lot of nines.

Is it good that they're nines?
Tell me it's good that they're all nines!

21:23.440 --> 21:26.839
- Amy?
- Yes, hello.

21:26.960 --> 21:29.959
Ah, thank heavens. I thought the TARDIS
had been flung off into the vortex

21:30.040 --> 21:33.319
with you inside it, lost for ever.

21:33.400 --> 21:35.239
You mean that could actually happen?!

21:35.320 --> 21:37.719
- You have got to get me out of here.
- How are the numbers?

21:38.920 --> 21:41.039
All fives.

21:41.120 --> 21:42.719
Fives?

21:44.800 --> 21:46.479
Even better.

21:46.560 --> 21:49.679
Still, it means the effect's almost
unbelievably powerful and dangerous,

21:49.760 --> 21:50.879
but don't worry.

21:50.960 --> 21:52.599
Hang on, OK?

21:52.680 --> 21:55.759
- I've got some rewiring to do.
- Hey! You..."hang on"!

22:04.760 --> 22:06.879
Hello, flatmate.

22:06.960 --> 22:08.799
Hey, man. Um...

22:08.880 --> 22:11.879
Listen, Sophie's coming round tonight,

22:11.960 --> 22:15.759
and I was wondering
if you could give us some space.

22:15.840 --> 22:18.359
Oh, don't mind me.
You won't even know I'm here.

- CRAIG: Oh, yeah.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.479
Are we going out?

22:37.560 --> 22:40.959
I've had a bit of a weird day.
Can we do pizza, booze, telly?

22:41.040 --> 22:42.799
Great, love it! Wait.

22:42.880 --> 22:46.799
No Melina, no crises,
no interruptions.

22:46.880 --> 22:49.559
Great. Excellent.

22:50.600 --> 22:52.279
Um, Soph...

22:53.720 --> 22:55.879
I've...

22:59.920 --> 23:01.679
I think...

23:02.920 --> 23:05.079
Where's this going?

23:06.200 --> 23:08.039
I think that we...

23:11.320 --> 23:12.919
...should...

23:14.160 --> 23:15.919
Mm?

23:16.000 --> 23:17.559
- Hello.
- What?

23:17.640 --> 23:19.199
Whoops, sorry.

23:19.280 --> 23:21.919
Don't worry, I wasn't listening -
in a world of my own down there.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.799
- I thought you were going out.
- Just reconnecting all the electrics.

23:24.880 --> 23:28.679
It's a real mess.
Where's the on-switch for this?

23:28.760 --> 23:31.279
- He really is on his way out.
- I don't mind, if you don't mind.

23:31.360 --> 23:35.079
- I don't mind. Why would I mind?
- Then stay.

23:35.160 --> 23:38.599
- Have a drink with us.
- What? Do I have to stay now?

23:38.680 --> 23:41.199
- Do you want to stay?
- I don't mind.

23:41.280 --> 23:43.799
- OK!
- Great!

23:43.880 --> 23:47.719
Cos life can seem pointless, Doctor.
Work, weekend, work, weekend.

23:47.840 --> 23:50.919
And there's six billion people
on the planet doing pretty much the same.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.919
Six billion people?
Watching you two at work,

23:53.000 --> 23:54.759
I'm starting to wonder
where they all come from.

23:54.840 --> 23:58.119
- What? What do you mean by that?
- So, the call centre's no good, then.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.999
What do you really want to do?

24:00.080 --> 24:03.119
Don't laugh.
I only ever told Craig about it.

24:03.200 --> 24:06.439
- Hmm?
- I want to work looking after animals.

24:06.560 --> 24:11.039
Maybe abroad.
I saw this orang-utan sanctuary on telly.

24:11.120 --> 24:13.599
- What's stopping you?
- She can't.

24:13.680 --> 24:16.159
- You need loads of qualifications.
- Yeah, true.

24:16.240 --> 24:19.479
Plus it's scary.
Everyone I know lives round here.

24:19.560 --> 24:23.119
Craig got offered a job in London,
better money, didn't take it.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.839
What's wrong with staying here?
I can't see the point of London.

24:25.920 --> 24:30.079
Well, perhaps that's you, then.
You'll just have to stay here, secure,

24:30.160 --> 24:32.279
and a little bit miserable,
until the day you drop.

24:32.360 --> 24:34.279
Better than trying and failing, eh?

24:34.360 --> 24:36.759
- You think I'd fail?
- Everybody's got dreams, Sophie.

24:36.840 --> 24:40.079
Very few are going to achieve them,
so why pretend?

24:41.800 --> 24:45.759
Perhaps, in the whole, wide universe,
a call centre is where you should be.

24:45.840 --> 24:48.119
Why are you saying that? That's horrible!

24:48.200 --> 24:49.479
- Is it true?
- Of course not.

24:49.560 --> 24:53.919
I'm not staying in a call centre
all my life. I can do anything I want!

24:54.000 --> 24:57.799
Oh! Yeah! Right!

24:57.880 --> 25:00.799
Oh, my God! Did you see what he just did?

25:00.920 --> 25:03.359
No, sorry. What's happening?
Are you going to live with monkeys now?

25:03.440 --> 25:05.199
It's a big old world, Sophie.

25:05.280 --> 25:08.719
Work out what's really
keeping you here, eh?

25:08.800 --> 25:10.719
I don't know.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.199
Dunno.

25:19.360 --> 25:22.839
So, are you going to be taking off, then,
seeing the world?

25:22.920 --> 25:24.799
What? Do you think I should?

25:24.880 --> 25:27.479
Yeah...

25:27.560 --> 25:30.559
Like the Doctor says,
what's keeping you here?

25:30.640 --> 25:32.839
Yeah, exactly! What?

25:35.920 --> 25:37.919
- Bye.
- See you.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.199
- See you in a bit.
- Yeah.

25:53.440 --> 25:55.159
Right. Shield's up.

25:55.240 --> 25:56.799
Let's scan!

25:58.720 --> 26:01.839
- What are you getting?
- Upstairs.

26:01.920 --> 26:04.159
No traces of high technology. Totally...

26:04.240 --> 26:06.359
normal. No no, no, no.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.559
It can't be! It's too normal.

26:08.640 --> 26:10.999
Only for you could too normal
be a problem.

26:11.080 --> 26:13.679
You said I could be lost for ever.
Just go upstairs.

26:13.800 --> 26:17.159
Without knowing, and get myself killed?
Then you really are lost.

26:17.240 --> 26:19.999
If I could just
get a look in there...

26:20.080 --> 26:21.439
Hold on.

26:21.520 --> 26:23.279
Use the data bank,

26:23.360 --> 26:26.479
get me the plans of this building -
its history, the layout, everything.

26:26.560 --> 26:29.639
Meanwhile, I shall recruit a spy.

26:52.040 --> 26:54.239
The Rotmeister...

26:55.320 --> 26:56.479
Ah!

26:56.560 --> 26:57.999
Ow!

27:03.920 --> 27:05.399
Craig!

27:06.440 --> 27:10.319
Craig. (KICKS DOOR)
Breakfast. It's normal.

27:10.400 --> 27:11.879
Craig?

27:14.600 --> 27:15.639
Craig!

27:17.480 --> 27:20.879
Craig, I told you not to touch it!
What's that?

27:20.960 --> 27:23.279
An unfamiliar
and obviously poisonous substance.

27:23.400 --> 27:26.719
"Oh, I know what would be really clever -
I'll stick my hand in it!"

27:26.800 --> 27:28.639
Come on, Craig, breathe.

27:30.080 --> 27:33.839
Come on, Craig, breathe!
Thems are healthy footballer's lungs!

27:34.760 --> 27:36.719
Right. Reverse the enzyme decay.

27:36.800 --> 27:39.559
Excite the tannin molecules.

27:50.120 --> 27:53.599
- I've got to go to work.
- On no account. You need rest.

27:53.680 --> 27:55.159
One more.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.799
It's the planning meeting, it's important.

28:03.880 --> 28:04.959
You're important.

28:07.960 --> 28:09.879
You're going to be fine, Craig.

28:24.880 --> 28:26.399
What?!

28:26.480 --> 28:29.439
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

28:42.120 --> 28:43.359
Oh, afternoon.

28:43.440 --> 28:46.319
I'm so sorry, Michael,
I don't know what happened.

28:46.400 --> 28:47.999
- I've got no excuse.
- I'm afraid

28:48.120 --> 28:50.359
that's not what my screen is telling me,
Mr Lang.

28:50.440 --> 28:51.719
(ANGRY VOICE ON HEADSET)

28:51.800 --> 28:53.839
What's he doing here?
What are you doing here?

28:53.960 --> 28:57.639
If that's your attitude, Mr Lang,
I suggest you take your custom elsewhere.

28:57.720 --> 28:59.959
- (BLOWS RASPBERRY)
- No, no! That's one of my best clients!

29:00.040 --> 29:02.399
Hello, Craig, how are you feeling?
Had some time to kill.

29:02.520 --> 29:04.999
I was curious, never worked in an office.
Never worked in anywhere.

29:05.080 --> 29:06.199
You're insane!

29:06.280 --> 29:08.079
Leave off the Doctor,
I love the Doctor.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.439
He was brilliant
in the planning meeting.

29:10.520 --> 29:12.279
You went to the planning meeting?

29:12.400 --> 29:16.279
Yes. I was your representative. We don't
need Mr Lang any more. Rude Mr Lang.

29:16.360 --> 29:18.199
Here you go,
and I found some custard creams.

29:18.280 --> 29:19.639
Sophie, my hero.

29:19.720 --> 29:22.639
Hi, Craig. I went on the web,
applied for a wildlife charity thing.

29:22.720 --> 29:25.199
They said I could always start
as a volunteer straightaway.

29:25.280 --> 29:28.599
- Should I do it?
- Yeah, great, yeah, good, go for it.

29:28.680 --> 29:30.559
You look awful.
About turn! Bed. Now.

29:30.640 --> 29:34.559
- Who next? Oh, yes.
- (MALE VOICE ON HEADSET)

29:34.640 --> 29:40.119
Hello, MrJoergensen. Can you hold?
I have to eat a biscuit.

29:57.680 --> 29:59.959
What the hell...?

30:01.400 --> 30:02.479
(CAT MIAOWS)

30:04.560 --> 30:06.559
Have you been upstairs?

30:06.640 --> 30:08.079
Yes?

30:08.160 --> 30:10.759
(THROATY MIAOW)

30:13.240 --> 30:16.279
You can do it. Show me what's up there.
What's behind that door?

30:16.360 --> 30:17.639
Try to show me.

30:17.720 --> 30:20.359
Oh, that doesn't make sense!
Ever see anyone go up there?

30:20.440 --> 30:22.679
Lots of people? Good, good.
What kind of people?

30:22.760 --> 30:25.119
- Miaow.
- People who never came back down.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.919
That's bad. That's very bad.

30:29.520 --> 30:31.359
(CAT MIAOWS)

30:31.440 --> 30:33.799
- Oh, hello.
- I can't take this any more.

30:33.880 --> 30:35.159
I want you to go!

30:37.520 --> 30:40.039
- You can have this back, an' all.
- What have I done?

30:40.120 --> 30:43.279
- For a start, talking to a cat.
- Lots of people talk to cats.

30:43.400 --> 30:46.079
Everybody loves you, and you're better
at football than me, and my job,

30:46.160 --> 30:51.479
and now Sophie's all, "Oh, monkeys,
monkeys!" And then...there's that!

30:51.560 --> 30:53.759
It's art! A statement on modern society.

30:53.840 --> 30:57.919
- "Ooh, ain't modern society awful?"
- Me and you, it's not going to work.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.359
You've been here three days,
the three weirdest days of my life.

31:00.480 --> 31:03.839
- Your days will get much weirder if I go.
- I thought it was good weird. It's bad.

31:03.920 --> 31:05.359
- I can't do this!
- I can't leave.

31:05.440 --> 31:06.959
Like you, I can't see the point
of anywhere else.

31:07.080 --> 31:10.799
- Madrid, ha, what a dump! I have to stay.
- No, you don't, you have to leave!

31:10.880 --> 31:12.679
- I can't go!
- Just get out!

31:12.800 --> 31:16.799
Right! Only way. I'm going to show you
something, but ssh, really, ssh!

31:16.880 --> 31:19.279
Oh, I am going to regret this.
OK, right...

31:19.360 --> 31:21.959
- First, general background!
- Yargh!

31:25.120 --> 31:27.399
Oh!

31:27.480 --> 31:29.239
Ow!

31:29.320 --> 31:31.119
- You're a...
- Yes.

31:31.200 --> 31:33.079
- From...
- Ssh.

31:33.160 --> 31:34.919
- You've got a TARDIS!
- Yes. Ssh!

31:35.000 --> 31:36.119
Eleventh!

31:36.200 --> 31:38.559
Right... OK, specific detail.

31:38.640 --> 31:40.199
BOTH: Argh!

31:42.520 --> 31:43.959
Amy! Amy!

31:47.080 --> 31:48.479
You saw my ad

31:48.560 --> 31:51.039
- in the paper shop window.
- Yes, with this right above it.

31:51.160 --> 31:55.519
Which is odd, because Amy hasn't written
it yet. Time travel, it can happen.

31:55.600 --> 31:57.879
That's a scanner! You've used...

31:57.960 --> 32:01.159
non-technological technology
of Lammasteen.

32:01.240 --> 32:03.079
(SHOUTS) Shut up!

32:13.240 --> 32:15.319
CHILD: Please can you help me?

32:16.400 --> 32:17.799
Hi.

32:17.880 --> 32:22.719
- Please. Will you help me?
- What's the matter, my love?

32:22.800 --> 32:25.639
Help you?

32:29.240 --> 32:30.839
Argh!

32:30.920 --> 32:35.799
I am never, never doing that
ever, ever again... Amy!

32:35.880 --> 32:37.079
That's Amy Pond!

32:37.160 --> 32:41.719
Oh, of course, you can understand us
now, hurrah (!) ...Got those plans yet?

32:44.600 --> 32:46.879
- Still searching for them.
- I've worked it out

32:46.960 --> 32:49.039
- with psychic help from a cat.
- Cat?

32:49.120 --> 32:51.959
Yes. I know he's got a time engine
in the flat upstairs.

32:52.040 --> 32:53.879
He's using innocent people
to try and launch it.

32:53.960 --> 32:55.999
Whenever he does, they get burnt up,
hence the stain...

32:56.080 --> 32:58.199
- From the ceiling.
- Well done, Craig.

32:58.280 --> 33:00.159
And you, Miss Pond, nearly get thrown off

33:00.240 --> 33:01.599
- into the Vortex.
- Lovely.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.039
- (SMASH)
- People are dying up there!

33:04.120 --> 33:06.639
People are dying... People are dying...
People are dying... People are dying...

33:06.720 --> 33:09.039
- Amy!
- (SCREAMS) Doctor!

33:09.120 --> 33:11.479
They're being killed!

33:11.560 --> 33:13.119
- Someone's up there.
- Oh, my...!

33:13.200 --> 33:15.399
(ENGINE GOES HAYWIRE)

33:17.560 --> 33:19.919
Doctor! Hang on!

33:21.520 --> 33:24.159
Craig, come on -
someone's dying up there.

33:25.120 --> 33:29.039
It's Sophie. It's Sophie
that's dying up there, it's Sophie!

33:29.120 --> 33:31.279
Doctor! Argh!

33:31.360 --> 33:33.719
- Where's Sophie?
- Wait, wait!

33:33.800 --> 33:35.879
- Amy?
- Are you upstairs?

33:35.960 --> 33:37.119
- Just going in.
- You can't be upstairs.

33:37.200 --> 33:39.199
- Of course I can be upstairs!
- Come on!

33:39.280 --> 33:43.279
No! I've got the plans. You cannot be
upstairs, it's a one-storey building.

33:43.360 --> 33:45.519
Thereis no upstairs!

33:52.800 --> 33:54.639
What?

33:56.240 --> 33:59.839
- What?
- Oh. Oh, of course!

34:01.280 --> 34:04.719
The time engine isn't in the flat.
The time engine isthe flat -

34:04.800 --> 34:07.919
someone's attempt to build a TARDIS.

34:08.000 --> 34:10.159
No, there's always been an upstairs.

34:10.240 --> 34:12.719
- Has there? Think about it.
- Yes.

No. I don't...

a disguise. It tricks your memory.

34:21.160 --> 34:23.399
- Craig!
- It's controlling her. It's willing her

34:23.480 --> 34:26.439
- to touch the activator.
- It's not going to have her!

34:26.520 --> 34:28.199
SOPHIE: Argh!

34:28.280 --> 34:30.879
- Ah! Deadlock seal!
- You've got to do something!

34:33.240 --> 34:36.359
What? Why's it let her go?

34:42.480 --> 34:44.999
- You will help me.
- Right! Stop!

Hello. I'm Captain Troy Handsome
of International Rescue.

34:48.680 --> 34:50.279
Please state the nature of your emergency.

34:50.360 --> 34:52.079
The ship has crashed. The crew are dead.

34:52.200 --> 34:55.119
- A pilot is required.
- You're the emergency crash program.

34:55.240 --> 34:58.279
A hologram. What? You've been luring
people up here so you can try them out?

34:58.360 --> 35:00.639
(MULTIPLE VOICES) You will help me,
you will help me, you will help me.

35:00.720 --> 35:02.159
Craig! Where am I?

35:02.200 --> 35:05.279
Hush! ...Human brains aren't strong
enough, they just burn, but you're stupid.

35:05.360 --> 35:09.159
- You just keep trying.
- 1 7 people have been tried.

35:09.240 --> 35:13.799
- 6,000,400,026 remain.
- Seriously, what is going on?

35:13.920 --> 35:17.319
Oh, for goodness' sake! The top floor of
Craig's building is an alien spaceship,

35:17.400 --> 35:19.359
intent on slaughtering
the population of this planet.

35:19.440 --> 35:20.879
Any questions? No, good.

35:20.920 --> 35:23.879
- Yes, I have questions.
- The correct pilot has now been found.

35:23.960 --> 35:25.639
Yes, I was worried you'd say that.

35:25.720 --> 35:27.199
He means you, Doctor, doesn't he?

35:27.280 --> 35:29.279
The correct pilot has been found.

35:29.360 --> 35:33.479
The correct pilot has been found.
The correct pilot has been found.

35:33.560 --> 35:34.919
What's happening?

35:35.000 --> 35:38.279
- It's pulling me in! I'm the new pilot!
- Could you do it?

35:38.360 --> 35:40.599
Could you fly the ship safely?

35:40.680 --> 35:43.719
No, I'm way too much for this ship.
My hand touches that panel,

35:43.800 --> 35:46.719
the planet doesn't blow up,
the whole solar system does.

35:46.800 --> 35:48.839
The correct pilot has been found.

35:48.920 --> 35:51.599
No...worst choice ever,
I promise you. Stop this!

35:51.680 --> 35:53.719
Doctor, it's getting worse.

35:53.800 --> 35:56.759
It doesn't want everyone.
Craig, it didn't want you!

35:56.840 --> 35:58.879
I spoke to him and he said
I couldn't help him!

35:58.960 --> 36:01.799
It didn't want Sophie before today,
but now it does. What's changed?

36:01.880 --> 36:03.279
Argh! No!

36:03.360 --> 36:06.559
I gave her the idea of leaving!
It's a machine that needs to leave.

36:06.640 --> 36:09.799
It wants people who want to escape,
and you don't want to leave, Craig.

36:09.880 --> 36:12.239
- You're Mr Sofa Man.
- Doctor!

36:12.320 --> 36:13.879
Craig, you can shut down the engine.

36:13.960 --> 36:17.319
Put your hand on the panel and
concentrate on why you want to stay!

36:17.400 --> 36:19.119
- Craig, no!
- Will it work?

36:19.200 --> 36:19.959
- Yes!
- Are you sure?

36:20.040 --> 36:21.639
- Yes!
- Is that a lie?

36:21.720 --> 36:23.159
Of course it's a lie!

36:34.360 --> 36:38.279
Think about everything that makes you want
to stay here! Why don't you want to leave?

- Honestly, do you mean that?

36:51.320 --> 36:54.519
- Of course I mean it! Do you mean it?
- I've always meant it. Seriously, though,

- do you mean it?
- Yes.

36:56.160 --> 36:57.759

remember? I still want you to keep them.

39:21.800 --> 39:22.959
Thank you, Craig.

39:23.040 --> 39:24.759
Thank you, Doctor.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.079
Sophie.

39:26.160 --> 39:30.279
Now, then.
6,000,400,026 people in the world.

39:30.360 --> 39:33.119
That's the number to beat.

39:34.280 --> 39:35.359
Yeah.

39:59.720 --> 40:04.159
Back in time! You need to go to
the paper shop, leave that note for me.

40:04.240 --> 40:07.799
Right little matchmaker, aren't you?
Can't you find me a fella?

40:07.880 --> 40:09.559
Oh, rectifier's playing up again...

40:09.640 --> 40:13.079
Hold on. You write the note,
and I'll change that will.

40:13.160 --> 40:15.519
- You got a pen?
- Make sure it's a red pen.
