01:03.334 --> 01:04.834
D'oh!

01:14.279 --> 01:15.295
Hmm?

01:25.556 --> 01:26.690
You little!

01:48.246 --> 01:49.646
Mm?

01:49.681 --> 01:50.914
Hmm?

01:50.948 --> 01:52.249
Mmm.

02:07.749 --> 02:09.149
Everybody out.

02:11.452 --> 02:13.954
Everybody in.

02:16.441 --> 02:17.541
Bathroom break!

02:17.575 --> 02:19.109
I spilled my pills!

02:19.143 --> 02:21.545
Music today
has no melody!

02:22.613 --> 02:24.348
Everybody out!

02:25.717 --> 02:27.651
Children, you can stop
writing letters of support

02:27.685 --> 02:29.686
to our troops;
that was just busywork.

02:32.390 --> 02:34.991
Now, I want to explain
Miss Hoover's absence.

02:35.026 --> 02:37.394
She is suffering from severe...

02:39.680 --> 02:41.681
...depression.

02:44.318 --> 02:45.752
Not to worry,

02:45.787 --> 02:47.771
she has been treated
with heavy doses of...

02:47.805 --> 02:50.140
Lorazepam and other drugs
from the...

02:50.174 --> 02:52.442
Benzodiazepine family.

02:55.680 --> 02:57.114
Now, until Miss Hoover returns,

02:57.148 --> 03:00.150
this class will be getting
a permanent substitute.

03:01.786 --> 03:04.154
Please let it be
someone smart, motivated,

03:04.188 --> 03:06.890
and who won't just teach us
corporate-sponsored lessons.

03:08.693 --> 03:10.260
Lisa, without
corporate sponsorship,

03:10.294 --> 03:12.062
we wouldn't be able to teach you
the three R's:

03:12.096 --> 03:14.147
reading, refreshment
and Raspberry Buzz Lite.

03:14.182 --> 03:15.649
Get your razz on!

03:20.421 --> 03:21.488
Confident,

03:21.522 --> 03:23.323
Vassar sticker
on the windshield.

03:23.357 --> 03:24.858
Could it be?

03:24.892 --> 03:27.027
Do I detect enthusiasm?

03:28.796 --> 03:30.664
She's brought
her own orrery!

03:30.715 --> 03:32.999
And it's got no Pluto!

03:33.050 --> 03:34.618
How cutting edge.

03:34.652 --> 03:36.720
Please be her,
please be her.

03:36.754 --> 03:38.188
Is this
Ms. Hoover's class?

03:38.222 --> 03:39.289
Score!

03:39.323 --> 03:41.625
Meet your new teacher,
Ms. Cantwell.

03:41.659 --> 03:44.227
Do not call her by
the obvious dirty nickname.

03:44.262 --> 03:45.629
Now I must meet with

03:45.663 --> 03:48.448
the new art teacher,
Mr. Testacleese.

03:49.484 --> 03:51.818
Lisa Simpson. Hi.

03:51.853 --> 03:53.820
As second grade
student-faculty liaison,

03:53.855 --> 03:55.989
I'd like to welcome you...
Get back in your seat.

03:56.023 --> 03:57.491
If I have any apples
that need polishing,

03:57.525 --> 03:58.692
I'll let you know.

03:58.726 --> 04:01.578
I understand there are
homework assignments.

04:01.612 --> 04:03.647
Mm.

04:03.681 --> 04:05.532
Well done, Ralpa.

04:05.566 --> 04:07.701
If I can't remember
the right letter,

04:07.735 --> 04:09.302
I just put an "A."

04:09.337 --> 04:11.071
Well, here's another one.

04:11.105 --> 04:15.208
Well, while you're grading
so generously, here's mine.

04:15.243 --> 04:16.743
"B."

04:16.777 --> 04:18.712
As in, "because I say so."

04:23.351 --> 04:26.553
Nothing brings them around
like old cafeteria meatballs.

04:26.587 --> 04:27.921
Meat?!

04:30.558 --> 04:32.058
I thought you might
be cold, honey,

04:32.093 --> 04:34.561
so I put this
chinchilla coat on you.

04:34.595 --> 04:35.595
Fur?!

04:37.398 --> 04:38.865
It's not really
chinchilla.

04:38.900 --> 04:41.301
I just thought she
needed more sleep.

04:43.404 --> 04:44.871
Hey, Flanders.

04:44.906 --> 04:46.690
Can I borrow some sugar?
Sure.

04:46.724 --> 04:48.859
Uh, a little cream?
Goes with the sugar.

04:48.893 --> 04:50.794
Now if you could make with
some bacon and eggs,

04:50.828 --> 04:51.895
I'll be on my way.

04:53.297 --> 04:55.348
Why don't you come on in
and have breakfast with us?

04:55.383 --> 04:56.900
Are your kids
gonna be there?

04:56.934 --> 04:58.118
Eh, for a little bit.

04:58.152 --> 05:00.120
Okay.

05:00.154 --> 05:02.105
Homer, you know my parents,
Capri and Nedward.

05:02.139 --> 05:03.573
Hey, hey, Homer J.

05:03.608 --> 05:05.976
How many beers did
you kill today?

05:07.512 --> 05:08.962
Dad, don't encourage him!

05:08.996 --> 05:12.065
Son, you are
the Mayor of Dullsville.

05:12.099 --> 05:14.701
Now, you know we don't
discuss politics at the table.

05:14.735 --> 05:15.919
Hello, police?

05:15.953 --> 05:18.588
I'd like to report
a buzz-kill in progress.

05:18.623 --> 05:19.990
There's no
emergency here.

05:20.024 --> 05:22.292
And please charge us
for the false report.

05:23.528 --> 05:25.662
I'm going out for a power walk.

05:25.696 --> 05:28.498
Whoa, this room just got
a whole lot cooler.

05:29.934 --> 05:31.034
Oh, man.

05:38.976 --> 05:41.745
Okay, children,
ten minutes of free play.

05:42.813 --> 05:44.147
I'm a fun factory.

05:47.285 --> 05:49.152
Lisa, free play.

05:49.186 --> 05:50.820
But I am playing.

05:50.855 --> 05:52.789
I'm hop-scotching
from paragraph to paragraph,

05:52.823 --> 05:55.458
climbing the monkey bars
of plot and theme.

05:55.493 --> 05:56.960
Ugh, bull-pie.

05:56.994 --> 05:59.129
You're trying to get
ahead of the other children.

05:59.163 --> 06:00.931
That's it,
you're losing joeys.

06:04.118 --> 06:05.518
Please keep them together.

06:05.553 --> 06:07.454
If not for me, for the mother.

06:11.325 --> 06:14.494
<i>Is it possible I've met</i>
<i>a teacher who doesn't like me?</i>

06:14.528 --> 06:16.496
The joeys go in feet first.

06:17.531 --> 06:19.482
Chauncey!

06:20.985 --> 06:23.203
Six miles, and I'm all smiles.

06:24.272 --> 06:25.772
Whew.

06:26.524 --> 06:27.791
Funyuns?

06:27.825 --> 06:28.858
Little Debbies?

06:29.994 --> 06:31.227
That's cross-legged music.

06:36.150 --> 06:38.118
Look at the size
of that bird.

06:38.152 --> 06:41.488
I'd go Henry VIII
on those drumsticks.

06:41.522 --> 06:43.323
Homer, I can't believe

06:43.357 --> 06:45.125
you're partaking with
my parents.

06:45.159 --> 06:46.159
Yeah, it's medicinal.

06:46.193 --> 06:47.861
We had a pain in our neck.

07:02.109 --> 07:03.893
I didn't know
you were left-handed.

07:12.253 --> 07:14.004
Homer, you'll need to
wear this eye patch

07:14.039 --> 07:15.205
for a couple weeks.

07:15.240 --> 07:18.409
And, uh, you may never
see a film in 3-D again.

07:19.994 --> 07:21.528
But the storytelling

07:21.563 --> 07:24.665
is finally catching up
to the technology.

07:24.699 --> 07:26.016
Ned Flanders.

07:26.051 --> 07:29.019
I can't believe
you struck my husband.

07:29.054 --> 07:31.722
Marge, I've been
racked with guilt and pain.

07:31.756 --> 07:35.192
My mustache fell out;
this is a clip-on.

07:35.226 --> 07:36.226
Sorry, Homer.

07:36.261 --> 07:38.195
Now, do you mind
if I pray at your bedside?

07:38.229 --> 07:39.263
No, I don't.

07:39.297 --> 07:41.365
<i>If</i> you pray to Superman.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.001
Not praying to a character
in a comic book.

07:44.035 --> 07:45.936
What about Christian
Archie comics?

07:45.970 --> 07:47.738
Neither canonical nor comical.

07:47.772 --> 07:49.373
Here, I'll get you started.

07:49.407 --> 07:51.942
Hail Superman, wearing tights,

07:51.976 --> 07:53.677
Clark Kent be thy name,

07:53.711 --> 07:55.946
one nation, under Zod...

07:55.980 --> 07:57.714
Not praying to Superman.
Grouch.

07:57.749 --> 08:00.084
Ned, Homie's a little
cranky right now.

08:00.118 --> 08:03.554
More than his eye,
I think you hurt his feelings.

08:03.588 --> 08:05.706
Give him one of your
famous murmurs, Marge.

08:05.740 --> 08:07.207
My what?
Your famous murmur.

08:07.242 --> 08:09.560
You know.

08:09.594 --> 08:11.728
I never made
that noise in my life!

08:13.264 --> 08:14.231
Thanks, Flanders.

08:14.265 --> 08:15.766
Punch my eye,
destroy my marriage.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.968
Now just pull the plug
and let me die!

08:18.002 --> 08:19.536
That's the plug
for the light.

08:29.414 --> 08:33.217
Neddy, I know you feel guilty
about coldcocking Homer.

08:33.251 --> 08:34.818
Please don't use
that word in bed.

08:35.854 --> 08:37.821
You need to get
some sleep.

08:38.923 --> 08:40.457
Dare I take another sleep aid?

08:42.659 --> 08:44.661
Better not take a full dose.

08:47.332 --> 08:49.967
Mmm. See you in eight hours.

09:03.298 --> 09:04.965
Was this always waiting for me,

09:04.999 --> 09:06.450
or was it recently
thrown together?

09:06.484 --> 09:08.018
That's what I want to know.

09:08.052 --> 09:10.771
♪ Hey-diddly hell-diddly

09:10.805 --> 09:13.590

09:15.393 --> 09:16.960

author of <i>The God Delusion!</i>

09:27.388 --> 09:30.123
I'm making Catholic
saint stew.

09:44.539 --> 09:46.840
No, not Surf 'n Murph.

09:50.578 --> 09:52.880
The answer to my woe

09:58.987 --> 10:00.654
Flag that for later.

10:00.688 --> 10:02.122
Finally.

10:02.156 --> 10:05.058
I know what I must do.

10:09.597 --> 10:11.198
Ms. Cantwell?
Yes?

10:11.232 --> 10:12.833
Why are you so mean to me?

10:12.867 --> 10:13.934
You really want to know?

10:13.968 --> 10:16.470
More than I want unicorns
to be real.

10:16.504 --> 10:18.538
Well, if you guess,
I'll give you extra credit.

10:18.573 --> 10:19.806
I remind you of you?

10:19.841 --> 10:21.008
Now you've got a demerit.

10:21.042 --> 10:22.843
This class
doesn't give demerits.

10:22.877 --> 10:24.711
Now it does,
and you just got another one.

10:24.746 --> 10:26.079
What if I homeschool?

10:26.114 --> 10:27.915
You're bluffing;
I've driven by your home.

10:29.450 --> 10:31.218
Principal Skinner...

10:31.252 --> 10:32.519
Not now.

10:32.553 --> 10:34.187
I'm dealing with
Mr. Testacleese.

10:34.222 --> 10:36.423
Look, kids can be
cruel, Dick.

10:36.457 --> 10:37.991
Ha-ha!

10:38.026 --> 10:40.460
We don't know
when we've gone too far!

10:46.434 --> 10:49.403
"Ann, Mark, Bill and Sally
are on the Ferris wheel.

10:49.437 --> 10:50.971
"Ann is behind Sally.

10:51.005 --> 10:52.522
Mark is
in front of Bill."

10:53.625 --> 10:55.525
Look who's on the Ferris wheel.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.844
Your precious joeys!

11:05.270 --> 11:08.238
Better switch to social studies.

11:08.273 --> 11:11.358
"Eleanor Roosevelt became
Franklin's eyes and ears and..."

11:12.727 --> 11:15.028
Here's the new
deal: you fail!

11:23.171 --> 11:24.471
Oh!

11:24.505 --> 11:26.073
I wish you wouldn't
wear sweaters

11:26.107 --> 11:27.641
that the senior
ladies knit.

11:27.675 --> 11:29.309
Well, putting my arms
in sleeves

11:29.344 --> 11:31.712
is about all I got
to offer a woman.

11:31.746 --> 11:33.046
Oh.

11:33.081 --> 11:34.881
What's the matter, sweetie?

11:34.916 --> 11:37.617
Is a book character
having difficulties?

11:37.652 --> 11:39.319
I have a bully at school.

11:39.354 --> 11:41.455
Oh. Did you tell the teacher?

11:41.489 --> 11:43.824
My bully <i>is</i> my teacher.

11:43.858 --> 11:45.959
A teacher can't be a bully.

11:45.994 --> 11:47.928
Oh, they sure can!

11:47.962 --> 11:49.496
When I was a boy,

11:49.530 --> 11:51.598
teachers would rap my knuckles
with a yardstick.

11:51.632 --> 11:55.268
Now you've got
the metric system.

11:55.303 --> 11:57.104
We don't have the metric system.

11:57.138 --> 11:59.172
What? This isn't Sweden?

11:59.207 --> 12:00.941
And I'm not King Olaf?

12:00.975 --> 12:04.544
Oh, I got some explaining to do
down at the bank.

12:07.448 --> 12:09.416
<i>Skinner!</i>

12:09.450 --> 12:10.851
Why am I here?

12:10.885 --> 12:13.320
Did this fat boy injure his eye
in shop class?

12:13.354 --> 12:14.921
That place is a killing field.

12:14.956 --> 12:16.289
We're here because

12:16.324 --> 12:19.026
our daughter is being
bullied by your teacher.

12:19.060 --> 12:21.128
Mrs. Simpson, this school
does not hire bullies.

12:21.162 --> 12:22.329
That's right. We...

12:22.363 --> 12:23.630
Quiet, nerd!

12:23.664 --> 12:25.265
Well, she's just a substitute.

12:25.299 --> 12:28.301
Maybe you could transfer
Ms. Cantwell to another school.

12:28.336 --> 12:30.504
Nix. She's already got
two weeks tenure,

12:30.538 --> 12:32.973
so she's impossible to dislodge.

12:33.007 --> 12:34.808
I hate unions.

12:34.842 --> 12:37.377
There's this guy at my plant,
caused three meltdowns,

12:37.412 --> 12:39.346
and he still
keeps his job.

12:39.380 --> 12:40.480
Homer, that's you.

12:40.515 --> 12:41.681
Oh, yeah.

12:41.716 --> 12:43.784
I say,
"Union," you say, "Power"!

12:43.818 --> 12:44.785
Union!
Power.

12:44.819 --> 12:46.353
Union!
Power.

12:46.387 --> 12:48.855
Marge, you're really
dogging it on the "power."

12:48.890 --> 12:50.023
But don't worry.

12:50.058 --> 12:52.859
Because of the
union, you're safe.

12:52.894 --> 12:55.195
So, just what are you
gonna do for our daughter?

12:55.229 --> 12:57.731
We should talk about what
we're going to <i>promise</i> to do,

12:57.765 --> 12:59.066
not what we'll actually do.

12:59.100 --> 13:01.401
We really
appreciate that.

13:04.806 --> 13:06.406
Look at those eyes.

13:06.441 --> 13:09.009
There's an employee with a
healthy case of the go-get-'ems.

13:10.445 --> 13:13.296
Hear that lion's roar
of determination.

13:15.032 --> 13:16.566
Homer, Homer, I
found the answer!

13:16.601 --> 13:17.634
Wha...? Huh?

13:17.668 --> 13:19.536
Flanders.
How did you get in here?

13:19.570 --> 13:21.838
This place is
a highly-sensitive area.

13:21.873 --> 13:24.491
Who here wants
to touch radiation?

13:24.525 --> 13:28.195
"Life shall go for life, eye
for an eye, tooth for a tooth."

13:28.229 --> 13:31.231
Hey, I don't go to where you
work and read the Bible to you.

13:31.265 --> 13:33.233
I would embrace
such a glad visit.

13:33.267 --> 13:34.501
Just what do you want?

13:34.552 --> 13:36.887
I want you to punch
me in the eye.

13:36.921 --> 13:38.338
If you do, then
we're even,

13:38.389 --> 13:40.624
according to Exodus,
Leviticus and Matthew.

13:40.658 --> 13:42.559
You went and hired
a law firm, eh?

13:42.593 --> 13:44.060
That's pretty aggressive.

13:44.095 --> 13:46.296
Jeepers creepers, pop my peeper!

13:46.330 --> 13:47.931
Come on, man.
What's the catch?

13:47.965 --> 13:50.066
Homer, just call me
a little bubble,

13:50.101 --> 13:51.568
'cause I'm on the level.

13:51.602 --> 13:52.569
Punch me.

13:52.603 --> 13:55.288
Hmm.

13:59.260 --> 14:00.760
Come on, Homer.

14:00.795 --> 14:02.496
I'm insisting
on a fisting.

14:02.530 --> 14:04.431
What's this
about a fisting?

14:04.465 --> 14:05.932
I'm not punching you,
Flanders.

14:05.967 --> 14:07.200
What? Why?

14:07.235 --> 14:09.469
Because if I hit you back,
we'll be even.

14:09.504 --> 14:13.807
But if I <i>don't</i> hit you,
that makes me the better man.

14:13.841 --> 14:16.460
And I'm liking the way
that feels.

14:16.494 --> 14:17.861
No, you can't.

14:17.895 --> 14:20.330
If I'm not as good as you,
then I'm horrible!

14:20.364 --> 14:22.432
It's not for me
to judge, Ned, because...

14:22.467 --> 14:24.167
I am the better man!

14:24.202 --> 14:26.322
Now, there's no need to...
Better man, coming through!

14:26.354 --> 14:29.189
Way better-better-better!
Way better-better-better!

14:29.223 --> 14:30.290
Zing!

14:30.324 --> 14:31.558
Enough.

14:31.592 --> 14:33.493
You may be the sweater man,
but Homer is the better man.

14:33.528 --> 14:35.111
Now you're rhyming?!

14:35.146 --> 14:36.112
Oh!

14:36.147 --> 14:38.515
I didn't know
you were left-handed.

14:44.240 --> 14:45.168
Hello, Lisa.

14:45.169 --> 14:47.170
I was shocked to hear
from Principal Skinner

14:47.204 --> 14:49.239
that you and I
aren't getting along.

14:49.273 --> 14:51.474
You should never tell
on a bully, Lisa.

14:51.509 --> 14:53.009
Everyone knows that.

14:55.046 --> 14:56.413
Lisa Simpson?!

14:56.447 --> 14:57.814
In detention?

14:57.848 --> 14:59.916
Every rap sheet
has a first line.

14:59.951 --> 15:02.218
What are you in for,
murdering Chopin?

15:03.688 --> 15:05.522
Chopin.

15:05.556 --> 15:07.007
Can I ask you guys something?

15:07.041 --> 15:09.142
Why does someone become a bully?

15:09.176 --> 15:10.710
Neglect.
Abuse.

15:10.745 --> 15:12.379
I'm a Cubs fan.

15:12.413 --> 15:14.848
But why would my teacher
be a bully?

15:14.882 --> 15:16.383
What? Huh?
I don't know.

15:16.417 --> 15:18.018
Your bully's
a teacher?

15:18.052 --> 15:21.221
That means
all of us can be teachers.

15:21.255 --> 15:22.255
Boo-yah!

15:22.290 --> 15:24.691
I'm gonna buy me
a Hyundai Elantra!

15:24.725 --> 15:26.426
Oh, cool!
Whoa!

15:26.460 --> 15:27.811
Oh.

15:30.765 --> 15:32.032
Do not cross.

15:32.066 --> 15:34.901
It is that monster that
terrorizes the jolly fat man!

15:34.935 --> 15:37.237
Come on, people.
You're safe as Sunday with me.

15:37.271 --> 15:39.606
I wouldn't hurt a fly.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.543
I saw the whole thing!

15:43.577 --> 15:47.047
That innocent fly
flew from that fresh pile

15:47.081 --> 15:50.350
of dog feces right into
that monster's mouth!

15:51.669 --> 15:52.902
Fear not, people.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.305
I will lead you safely across.

15:56.824 --> 15:57.924
Idiot!

15:57.958 --> 15:59.376
Help me, Flanders.

16:01.829 --> 16:03.713
Never get into Heaven.

16:03.748 --> 16:06.099
Took harp lessons for nothing.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.034
And here comes the tarp.

16:08.069 --> 16:11.404
The word "tarp," of course,
is short for "tarpaulin,"

16:11.439 --> 16:13.573
which Wikipedia defines
as a strong,

16:13.607 --> 16:15.909
resilient,
water-resistant material.

16:15.943 --> 16:18.378
That definition is a hit
with no errors!

16:18.412 --> 16:20.113
What's wrong, sweetie?

16:20.147 --> 16:22.749
My teacher's
still bullying me.

16:22.783 --> 16:24.217
Even after we came to school?

16:25.686 --> 16:27.320
That just
made it worse.

16:27.355 --> 16:29.422
Oh, every time
I try to fix things,

16:29.457 --> 16:31.257
it just makes things worse.

16:31.292 --> 16:33.426
But I'm gonna fix this.

16:33.461 --> 16:35.628
Uh-huh.

16:35.663 --> 16:37.764
I think I have an idea.

16:37.798 --> 16:42.135
Now there's a baby duck
paddling around on the tarp.

16:42.169 --> 16:45.839
You think they move those legs
one at a time or both at once?

16:45.873 --> 16:47.757
Oh, I'd go with
one at a time, Vic.

16:47.792 --> 16:50.160
You know, the great
Mel Ott used to raise ducks

16:50.194 --> 16:51.861
in Louisiana
during the off-season.

16:51.896 --> 16:53.396
And when a duck got sick,

16:53.431 --> 16:56.433
he would take it to bed with him
till it got well.

16:56.467 --> 16:57.434
Mm-hmm.

16:59.970 --> 17:02.806
Flanders, I've come
to forgive you.

17:02.840 --> 17:04.973
Oh, my prayers
have been answered!

17:05.009 --> 17:06.843
Well, actually,
just this one.

17:06.877 --> 17:09.546
Uh, there is one condition.

17:09.579 --> 17:10.814
You want to hit me.

17:10.848 --> 17:12.348
Well, sir, here's
a roll of quarters

17:12.383 --> 17:14.349
to put in your fist for
extra punching power.

17:14.385 --> 17:15.825
Now, you can shatter
my orbital bone.

17:15.853 --> 17:17.487
That'll knock the
wax off my candle.

17:17.521 --> 17:19.055
Don't want to hit you.

17:19.089 --> 17:20.490
I want your wife.

17:22.673 --> 17:26.695
To elaborate,
I want your wife, the teacher,

17:26.701 --> 17:28.896
to help get rid
of Lisa's substitute.

17:29.064 --> 17:31.398
Edna? You know how you said
you could help me

17:31.433 --> 17:33.801
with any desire,
and nothing was forbidden?

17:33.835 --> 17:36.704
Well, sir, I want you
to rid of Lisa's bully teacher.

17:36.738 --> 17:38.372
Ooh.

17:38.406 --> 17:40.824
Well, there's only one
way: the nuclear option.

17:40.859 --> 17:42.393
How much plutonium
do you want?

17:42.427 --> 17:43.961
Got to warn you,

17:43.995 --> 17:46.363
it might take me
20 minutes to get it.

17:51.803 --> 17:53.637
Ms. Cantwell?
Yes?

17:53.671 --> 17:56.306
I have a new student
for your class.

17:59.310 --> 18:00.144
Yo.

18:00.178 --> 18:02.112
Yes, this is
a very rare

18:02.147 --> 18:03.981
mid-year two-grade
send-back.

18:04.015 --> 18:06.116
Something's fishy.
Are you dating this boy?

18:06.151 --> 18:07.618
Right.

18:07.652 --> 18:10.020
I can't be around him
'cause he's so delicious.

18:11.222 --> 18:14.625
Well, I can't see
what harm one kid could do.

18:25.920 --> 18:29.406
When I come out of this,
I'll be a butterfly.

18:32.477 --> 18:34.511
I just went to the bathroom
for two minutes.

18:34.546 --> 18:36.647
I know.
Posted a video online.

18:36.681 --> 18:39.833
Stupid Lisa, stupid Lisa,
stupid Lisa.

18:39.868 --> 18:41.201
Okay, you've won.

18:41.236 --> 18:42.603
You've driven
me out of this

18:42.637 --> 18:45.172
plum substitute
teaching job.

18:45.206 --> 18:47.991
Ms. Cantwell,
I can make this stop.

18:48.026 --> 18:50.494
All you have to do is like me.

18:50.528 --> 18:52.262
I... I can't.

18:54.833 --> 18:56.300
Wait, wait.

18:56.334 --> 18:57.701
There's no need to leave.

18:57.735 --> 18:59.820
You showed up before the
students; that's all we asked.

18:59.854 --> 19:02.572
You two are the worst-dressed
gay men I've ever met.

19:03.591 --> 19:05.242
Ms. Cantwell, wait!

19:05.260 --> 19:07.177
I've got to know
before you leave.

19:07.212 --> 19:08.796
Why don't you like me?

19:08.830 --> 19:11.014
Lisa, sometimes you just
don't like a person.

19:11.049 --> 19:13.016
There's no logical
explanation.

19:13.051 --> 19:14.301
It just is.

19:14.335 --> 19:16.436
That is so unsatisfying.

19:17.472 --> 19:18.739
Here we go.

19:18.773 --> 19:20.874
If you don't get what you want,
you get all pouty.

19:20.909 --> 19:22.676
All you pretty girls
are the same.

19:22.710 --> 19:24.178
You think I'm pretty?

19:24.212 --> 19:26.747
Right, like you don't get told
that every day of your life,

19:26.781 --> 19:28.148
with your perfect blonde hair,

19:28.183 --> 19:31.251
that Kewpie doll voice
that drives the boys crazy.

19:31.286 --> 19:33.587
And what eight-year-old
wears pearls?

19:33.621 --> 19:37.024
Bookworms like me can't
stand party girls like you.

19:37.058 --> 19:39.993
She hates me
because I'm pretty!

19:41.946 --> 19:44.181
Not so pretty now,
are you?

19:44.215 --> 19:46.150
Can you sign my yearbook?

19:46.184 --> 19:48.519
I'm glad the only
beef between us

19:48.553 --> 19:49.686
is this burger.

19:49.721 --> 19:52.022
Mm, they sure are
getting along.

19:52.056 --> 19:53.757
They don't know it,

19:53.791 --> 19:56.260
but I slipped a
little

19:56.294 --> 19:59.463
into the brownies
I gave them.

19:59.497 --> 20:02.099
How long has it been since
we prayed together, neighbor?

20:02.133 --> 20:03.200
This is praying?

20:03.234 --> 20:05.002
Let me out of here!

20:05.003 --> 20:10.003
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

20:10.038 --> 20:12.038
Help me, God.

20:55.167 --> 20:56.209
Shh!
