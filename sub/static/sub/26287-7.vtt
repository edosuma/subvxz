00:03.873 --> 00:05.309
You can make a difference
in your life.

00:05.353 --> 00:06.615
And for your country.

00:06.658 --> 00:08.008
Over my left shoulder,
two tables back.

00:08.051 --> 00:10.053
His name is Victor Vasquez.

00:10.097 --> 00:11.315
I'’m gonna need you to kill him.

00:15.232 --> 00:17.278
Victor!

00:17.321 --> 00:19.410
!¡Ayuda!

00:19.454 --> 00:21.499
Who'’s this?

00:21.543 --> 00:23.632
I'’m someone who knows
what you'’re really after.

00:23.675 --> 00:25.068
Wes Cole.

00:25.112 --> 00:27.331
I can give him to you.

00:35.731 --> 00:36.906

00:36.949 --> 00:40.431
♪ I should have never

RIANA: You can'’t ground me.
I have a date tonight.

00:45.132 --> 00:46.916
It was canceled by management.

00:46.959 --> 00:49.440
Riana, did you
or did you not

00:49.484 --> 00:52.661
sneak out
with the car last night?

00:52.704 --> 00:54.706
My car. And I was home by 11:00.

00:54.750 --> 00:59.581
Yeah, with exhibit "A": Dylan'’s
sweatshirt in the backseat.

00:59.624 --> 01:02.671
Stop treating me
like I'’m on the stand.

01:02.714 --> 01:05.369
Well, stop acting
like a hostile witness.

01:05.413 --> 01:08.198
Roger? Why aren'’t
you more upset?

01:08.242 --> 01:11.723
Because I already fixed
the situation.

01:11.767 --> 01:15.292
Two words: women'’s college.

01:15.336 --> 01:17.729
Not funny.
Very funny.I'’m not joking.

01:17.773 --> 01:21.081
Aren'’t we all tired
of having this conversation?

01:21.124 --> 01:22.560
Mmm.Right? Riana,

01:22.604 --> 01:24.301
you'’ve tried dating.
It'’s been a disaster.

01:24.345 --> 01:27.174
You can try again
when you'’re 30.

01:29.132 --> 01:30.090
Hello?

01:30.133 --> 01:31.178
MAYA: Murtaugh?

01:31.221 --> 01:32.831
Hi, it'’s Maya Flynn.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.964
Hello, Maya.

01:35.007 --> 01:36.400
Is everything okay?

01:36.444 --> 01:38.054
Yeah, I'’m looking for my dad

01:38.098 --> 01:40.926
because he was bringing me
candy, sodas and Fireballs

01:40.970 --> 01:42.841
to my debate last night,

01:42.885 --> 01:44.582
but he never came.

01:44.626 --> 01:45.975
Honey. Who are you talking to?

01:46.018 --> 01:48.543
It'’s Murtaugh.

01:48.586 --> 01:49.631
Murtaugh who?

01:49.674 --> 01:51.154
That would be Roger Murtaugh.

01:51.198 --> 01:54.157
I'’m Cole's partner.
And you must be...

01:54.201 --> 01:55.593
Natalie Flynn.

01:55.637 --> 01:58.292
I'’m Maya's mom.
I'’m so sorry she bothered you.

01:58.335 --> 02:01.382
Hey, no bother.
Um, is everything okay?

02:01.425 --> 02:04.472
I am sure Cole
is just being Cole, but...

02:04.515 --> 02:06.213
Maya is heartbroken
that he flaked.

02:06.256 --> 02:09.564
Andrew'’s away and I'm at work,
and so we are up a creek

02:09.607 --> 02:10.826
without a sitter.

02:10.869 --> 02:13.176
Well, I'’m sure Cole
has a good excuse.

02:13.220 --> 02:15.483
Excuses were
never Cole'’s problem.

02:15.526 --> 02:17.006
It'’s just... you know,

02:17.049 --> 02:20.488
I finally let him back
into Maya'’s life and he bails?

02:20.531 --> 02:24.840
Listen, uh, my daughter Riana

02:24.883 --> 02:27.799
has no plans and would
love the opportunity

02:27.843 --> 02:29.192
to babysit Maya.

02:29.236 --> 02:31.020
Really? That would be amazing.

02:31.063 --> 02:33.327
When I see Cole,
I will tell him...

02:33.370 --> 02:35.285
Tell him he'’s a jerk.

02:35.329 --> 02:37.026
...to give you a call.

02:37.069 --> 02:38.897
Sure. Improvise.

02:38.941 --> 02:40.899
Thanks, Roger.

02:45.904 --> 02:47.645
BAILEY:
The Gute has been my partner

02:47.689 --> 02:49.473
for 14 hours
and I'’m already thinking

02:49.517 --> 02:50.866
irreconcilable differences.

02:50.909 --> 02:53.521
Well, at least she
shows up to work.

02:53.564 --> 02:57.220
Cole? Totally MIA.
Radio silence.

02:57.264 --> 02:59.918
I would kill for some
peace and quiet right now.

02:59.962 --> 03:01.137
Eh, she can'’t
be that bad.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.878
Not that bad?
She'’s a wild animal.

03:02.921 --> 03:05.054
You know, she smacks her gum,

03:05.097 --> 03:08.275
she interrupts and she has
the nerve to call me...

03:10.929 --> 03:13.236
I hate her.You'’re briefing the
boss without me?

03:13.280 --> 03:14.890
I wouldn'’t dream of it, partner.

03:14.933 --> 03:18.763
Okay, well,
someone needs to update me.

03:18.807 --> 03:20.200
Scorsese, what do we have?

03:20.243 --> 03:22.767
Male, mid-20s.
Blood on his broken wrist

03:22.811 --> 03:25.074
show his own gun was used
on him in a struggle.

03:25.117 --> 03:26.902
So the vic tried to fight back.Well, actually,

03:26.945 --> 03:28.817
there were several sets
of male footprints

03:28.860 --> 03:30.558
dragged to the tire burns.

03:30.601 --> 03:32.081
We'’re looking at an abduction.

03:32.124 --> 03:34.518
So this guy never
finished the job.

03:34.562 --> 03:35.911
Any ID on the body?

03:35.954 --> 03:37.086
BAILEY: Not yet, but I'’ve taken
prints and photos

03:37.129 --> 03:39.523
and I'’ll cross-reference
them at RHD.

03:39.567 --> 03:41.133
Or we could do it the fast way,
which is my way.

03:41.177 --> 03:42.918
You can'’t tou...

03:42.961 --> 03:45.573
SCORSESE: That'’s cool.I knew it.

03:45.616 --> 03:47.052
Mm. Bartolo Huerta,

03:47.096 --> 03:49.881
Vasquez Cartel. I'’d recognize
that butt anywhere.

03:51.709 --> 03:54.712
What? I was undercover,
we were at a wedding.

03:54.756 --> 03:56.932
It was actually pretty
beautiful, so...

03:56.975 --> 04:00.414
It'’s unorthodox,
but, u-uh, effective.

04:00.457 --> 04:02.372
Try "lucky."And kind of gross?

04:02.416 --> 04:04.592
So who is our missing person?

04:04.635 --> 04:06.289
Oh, that I don'’t know.

04:06.333 --> 04:10.641
All that was left behind was a
broken phone and a bag of candy.

04:22.871 --> 04:26.744
Well, that explains
the radio silence.

04:26.788 --> 04:28.616
What are you talking about?

04:29.791 --> 04:32.924
The Vasquez Cartel has Cole.

04:37.581 --> 04:39.714
♪

04:50.072 --> 04:53.162
The whole line, huh?

04:53.205 --> 04:54.250
Impressive.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.079
Not your first time
in the chair?

04:57.122 --> 04:59.647
What'’s your move?

04:59.690 --> 05:02.345
Fingernails?

05:02.389 --> 05:04.739
For now.

05:04.782 --> 05:06.741
But toenails are
more debilitating.

05:06.784 --> 05:10.527
You see? That'’s new.
I should'’ve recertified.

05:17.099 --> 05:19.884
Look, if I cut you off
on the freeway, I apologize.

05:19.928 --> 05:21.190
Oh, you'’re not here for me.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.584
Well, who can I thank
for this hospitality?

05:27.675 --> 05:29.851
SOFIA:
Agent Cole.

05:35.291 --> 05:37.075
!¡Ayuda!

05:37.119 --> 05:39.556
!¡Ayuda!

05:39.600 --> 05:40.992
Sofia Vasquez.

05:42.820 --> 05:44.344
Been a while.

05:44.387 --> 05:45.910
15 years.

05:45.954 --> 05:47.869
And yet, it feels
like just yesterday

05:47.912 --> 05:49.784
that you murdered my husband.

05:49.827 --> 05:53.657
Done a lot of things
I'’m not proud of.

05:53.701 --> 05:55.920
I guess all I can say
is I'’m sorry.

05:57.705 --> 06:00.098
No, you'’re not.

06:00.142 --> 06:02.318
But you will be.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.498
TRISH: Natalie,
it'’s so great to meet you.

06:08.542 --> 06:09.804
You, too.

06:09.847 --> 06:12.197
And you must be Maya.

06:13.764 --> 06:15.810
Wow, nice digs.
Thank you.

06:15.853 --> 06:17.202
All right, let'’s go
pick out a game.

06:17.246 --> 06:19.204
Yeah.All right. Well,
have fun, you two.

06:19.248 --> 06:20.336
Be good.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.598
MAYA:
Bye.
Bye.

06:23.208 --> 06:25.820
I really can'’t thank you enough
for doing this.

06:25.863 --> 06:27.125
Oh, please, are you serious?

06:27.169 --> 06:29.432
We are here to help
in any way we can.

06:29.476 --> 06:30.607
Thank you.

06:30.651 --> 06:32.827
So have you heard from Cole?

06:32.870 --> 06:35.438
Well, can'’t say
I'’m holding my breath.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.311
It'’s Roger. Hi.
Oh.

06:39.355 --> 06:41.183
Y-You won'’t believe
who just arrived.

06:44.447 --> 06:46.362
Okay.

06:48.277 --> 06:50.322
I'’ll tell her.

06:52.499 --> 06:54.414
Okay, I love you, too.

06:57.591 --> 06:59.201
What happened?

07:01.595 --> 07:04.162
SOFIA:
Have you ever loved someone?

07:04.206 --> 07:05.729
No.

07:05.773 --> 07:08.384
Of course you haven'’t.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.909
A monster like you, you can'’t
imagine what that'’s like.

07:11.953 --> 07:15.086
To make someone
your whole world.

07:18.612 --> 07:20.396
You think this hurts?

07:20.440 --> 07:24.487
You don'’t know what suffering is
so I am going to teach you.

07:28.012 --> 07:29.840
COLE:
Is this really necessary?

07:29.884 --> 07:31.581
I told you guys,
I tripped on a bullet.

07:31.625 --> 07:33.278
Is that right?

07:35.106 --> 07:37.718
It'’s surprisingly rocky
out there, in the Himalayas.

07:39.110 --> 07:40.938
I'’m a photographer.

07:40.982 --> 07:43.201
Had the camera, it was just
shot right out of my hands.

07:43.245 --> 07:44.986
Mm. They must really
hate your work.

07:45.029 --> 07:46.944
Yeah, it'’s the curse
of the artist

07:46.988 --> 07:48.990
to be unappreciated
in his own time.

07:49.033 --> 07:50.992
And to be target practice,
apparently.

07:54.952 --> 07:56.998
COLE:
Ouch! Ow.

07:57.041 --> 07:58.652
Oh, no,
they said they numbed you.

07:58.695 --> 08:01.002
Did they not
Did I just...No. No, no, no.

08:01.045 --> 08:02.699
It... it was a bad joke.

08:02.743 --> 08:05.006
You have
a very steady hand.

08:05.049 --> 08:08.400
Okay. Now I know you'’re lying.

08:13.667 --> 08:15.669
So what do you think, Doc?

08:15.712 --> 08:17.279
Am I gonna make it?

08:22.371 --> 08:25.853
Looks like today'’s
your lucky day.

08:25.896 --> 08:28.812
I was just gonna say that.

08:38.430 --> 08:40.128
BAILEY: Here'’s what we know.
The time of death

08:40.171 --> 08:42.086
of the body means Cole
was taken around 7:00 p.m.,

08:42.130 --> 08:44.001
but the traffic cam has
his car heading north

08:44.045 --> 08:45.568
on Route 14 late last night.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.744
Okay, I'’ll put in a call to
all the local departments.

08:47.788 --> 08:49.659
In the meantime, put
out a statewide BOLO.

08:49.703 --> 08:51.052
You'’re not serious. A BOLO?

08:51.095 --> 08:52.140
That'’s it

08:52.183 --> 08:54.098
Louie Gutierrez,
Robbery-Homicide.

08:54.142 --> 08:55.273
You don'’t say. Pleasure.

08:55.317 --> 08:57.885
Is it?
Look, I know
these Vasquez goons.

08:57.928 --> 08:59.147
Let me shake some trees,

08:59.190 --> 09:00.888
see if somebody squeals
about a safe house.

09:00.931 --> 09:02.716
The Gute likes to shake things.

09:02.759 --> 09:04.935
Fine, go. Both of you.

09:04.979 --> 09:06.807
Who hired the new detective?

09:06.850 --> 09:08.330
Not me.
Why don'’t you ask Murtaugh

09:08.373 --> 09:10.550
when he'’s done chatting it up
with the CIA?

09:10.593 --> 09:12.421
Who do we know at the CIA?

09:18.993 --> 09:20.560
Detective.

09:20.603 --> 09:22.736
Have a seat. You hungry?

09:22.779 --> 09:25.782
Hungry

09:25.826 --> 09:27.044
Yeah, all three.

09:27.088 --> 09:29.830
Just a little melodramatic.

09:29.873 --> 09:31.571
Sofia Vasquez has my partner.

09:31.614 --> 09:34.225
I don'’t know why she took him,
or what she'’s doing with him,

09:34.269 --> 09:35.792
but we'’re running out of time.

09:35.836 --> 09:37.359
Come on, man. Calm down. Relax.

09:37.402 --> 09:40.144
All right?
It'’s only been 16 hours.

09:40.188 --> 09:42.625
Now how the hell would
you know that?

09:42.669 --> 09:44.453
When Sofia showed up to the buy,

09:44.496 --> 09:47.804
I knew it wasn'’t about
an ops list. Come on.

09:47.848 --> 09:50.067
You kidding me? No.

09:50.111 --> 09:51.982
This was about him.

09:52.026 --> 09:54.115
So you sold him out?

09:54.158 --> 09:58.119
No, I put my best guy in.

09:58.162 --> 09:59.511
He can handle himself,

09:59.555 --> 10:01.818
and now, with any luck,
he'’ll handle her, too.

10:01.862 --> 10:05.213
Is this what you do?

10:05.256 --> 10:07.955
You throw away the people
that you care about?

10:07.998 --> 10:09.609
We'’re all expendable.

10:09.652 --> 10:12.568
Cole knows that, all right?
Those are the rules.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.309
Not mine.

10:35.547 --> 10:37.637
We'’ll work
on their bedside manners.

10:37.680 --> 10:41.510
I don'’t think you realize the
gravity of your situation, Cole.

10:41.553 --> 10:43.425
Sure I do.

10:43.468 --> 10:45.601
You'’re gonna put
a bullet in my brain.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.690
No. I'’m not.

10:54.784 --> 10:56.917
No.

11:12.323 --> 11:13.673
No.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.413
Easy, detective.

11:15.457 --> 11:17.633
If you panic, you'’ll
only suffocate faster.

11:19.809 --> 11:21.985
No.

11:25.815 --> 11:27.034
No!

11:29.776 --> 11:30.994
No! No!

11:40.700 --> 11:43.441
MURTAUGH:
That'’s Cole's car.

11:43.485 --> 11:47.837
The Gute'’s intel is correct.
He'’s here.

11:47.881 --> 11:50.710
OFFICER: Exit team, on me!

11:53.713 --> 11:55.453
Go, go, go!

11:55.497 --> 11:57.151
Move! Move!

11:57.194 --> 11:59.457
Let'’s go!
All clear!

12:04.549 --> 12:06.943
OFFICER: Looks like this place
is locked down already.

12:06.987 --> 12:08.249
Too late.

12:16.866 --> 12:17.824
Hey.

12:17.867 --> 12:18.912
MAYA: Murtaugh.

12:18.955 --> 12:20.522
Have you found my dad yet?

12:20.565 --> 12:24.395
Not yet, sweetie,
but we'’re working on it.

13:24.412 --> 13:26.414
You left him for dead.

13:26.457 --> 13:27.632
So you brought me down here

13:27.676 --> 13:29.591
so I can see you
throw a little tantrum?

13:29.634 --> 13:30.766
No, to see this.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.508
We found his
fingernails.

13:33.551 --> 13:36.119
You said he'’d be all right.
You said he could handle this.

13:36.163 --> 13:37.512
Well, the Cole I knew would'’ve.

13:37.555 --> 13:38.992
Well, the Cole I know
is in trouble

13:39.035 --> 13:42.430
because of you, and I need you
to help me get him back.

13:42.473 --> 13:44.998
I cannot operate stateside.

13:45.041 --> 13:47.565
Since when has that stopped you?

13:49.741 --> 13:52.309
Okay, look, there may be
another way.

13:52.353 --> 13:53.833
I'’m listening.

13:53.876 --> 13:57.749
Benny Avila, he'’s a business
associate of Sofia'’s.

13:57.793 --> 13:59.142
Your boys

13:59.186 --> 14:00.883
arrested him for assault
this morning.

14:00.927 --> 14:03.755
He'’s in a holding cell
downstairs.

14:03.799 --> 14:05.670
And?

14:05.714 --> 14:08.499
And I'’m sure he'd like
to avoid a 20-year sentence.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.893
I mean,
he'’s got quite the record,

14:10.937 --> 14:12.416
but he'’s connected.

14:12.460 --> 14:14.027
You let him out,
he can find Cole.

14:14.070 --> 14:18.335
I'’m supposed to just
walk a felon out of jail

14:18.379 --> 14:21.338
and hope that
he gives me good information?

14:21.382 --> 14:23.906
You got a better idea?

14:27.823 --> 14:30.173
Where you taking me?

14:30.217 --> 14:32.872
Depends.
On?

14:32.915 --> 14:36.440
Whether you tell me
where Sofia Vasquez is.

14:36.484 --> 14:37.572
I need to find her.

14:37.615 --> 14:40.444
Nah. Can'’t help
you there.

14:40.488 --> 14:42.969
Hey, don'’t sell yourself
so short, Benny.

14:43.012 --> 14:44.318
Why would I help a cop?

14:44.361 --> 14:47.277
Because if you do,
those cuffs come off

14:47.321 --> 14:48.757
and you walk away a free man.

14:48.800 --> 14:52.935
How do I know you'’re not
just gonna arrest me again?

14:55.764 --> 14:58.767
I guess we'’re just gonna

I am great under pressure.

real soon.

You know, the doctors said that
if I was five minutes later,

that you dug yourself
out of the earth

27:11.281 --> 27:12.543
with your own fingertips?

27:12.587 --> 27:15.285
Oh, that'’s, like,
Tarantino-level badass.

27:15.329 --> 27:17.287
Look, guys, let'’s, uh,
give him his space.

27:17.331 --> 27:19.246
Yeah, later.
Okay.

27:19.289 --> 27:21.248
What the hell
are you doing here?

27:21.291 --> 27:22.641
Did you get discharged?

27:22.684 --> 27:24.468
Not in so many words.
What?

27:24.512 --> 27:25.556
You just pulled
the tubes out

27:25.600 --> 27:26.819
and left?
Cole, you...
Last night.

27:26.862 --> 27:29.082
What?
Did you say that
you went to Barnes?

27:29.125 --> 27:32.259
Please tell me that I'’m
remembering it wrong.

27:32.302 --> 27:33.869
I really wish I could.

27:33.913 --> 27:36.742
:
No.

27:36.785 --> 27:38.265
What did he have you do?

27:38.308 --> 27:40.267
That doesn'’t matter.
What matters is you'’re back.

27:40.310 --> 27:42.661
It does matter; this
is how Barnes works.

27:42.704 --> 27:44.619
You have no idea what
you'’ve set in motion.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.447
What did he want?
W

27:46.490 --> 27:48.405
AVERY: Can someone
explain to me how

27:48.449 --> 27:50.277
a handcuffed, two-time felon

27:50.320 --> 27:54.150
just walks out of RHD?

27:54.194 --> 27:55.282
Where'’s Benny Avila, people?

27:55.325 --> 27:57.153
Find him before
the chief calls me back.

27:57.197 --> 27:58.546
That means now.

27:58.589 --> 28:00.548
Who'’s Benny Avila?

28:00.591 --> 28:03.290
He'’s a drug trafficker.

28:03.333 --> 28:04.291
Criminal, you know...

28:04.334 --> 28:05.858
BAILEY:
An ex-lieutenant

28:05.901 --> 28:06.989
of the Vasquez Cartel.

28:07.033 --> 28:08.338
GUTE:
Your friend Sofia

28:08.382 --> 28:10.427
dropped a dime on him,
landed his ass in jail.

28:12.212 --> 28:14.693
Do we still have
Sofia'’s guy in custody?

28:14.736 --> 28:17.696
Yeah. Unless he walked out, too.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.262
Let'’s start squeezing him.

28:19.306 --> 28:21.743
We find out where Sofia is,
we find Benny.

28:21.787 --> 28:22.701
How do you know?

28:22.744 --> 28:24.572
Hey, the man was buried alive.

28:24.615 --> 28:26.705
Less doubting,
more squeezing.

28:31.405 --> 28:32.754
That'’s why Barnes
wanted him out.

28:32.798 --> 28:34.930
He'’s gonna kill Sofia,
make Benny king.

28:34.974 --> 28:36.976
I got to come clean with Avery.Absolutely not.

28:37.019 --> 28:39.369
You do that, you can enjoy
your retirement in jail.

28:39.413 --> 28:41.763
This is all my doing.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.069
You did it for me.

28:43.112 --> 28:45.724
Let'’s find Benny before
he does anything.

28:45.767 --> 28:48.422
I'’m not gonna let Barnes
ruin your life, too.

28:50.946 --> 28:53.383
You think you can ask that
with a little less judgment?

28:53.427 --> 28:55.211
No, no, no, no.
There was no judgment.

28:55.255 --> 28:56.473
It was a genuine
question.

28:56.517 --> 28:58.606
Do you want to do this
my way or your way?

28:58.649 --> 28:59.999
Right there. That'’s judgment.

29:00.042 --> 29:03.263
My way being speedy,
your way being slow,

29:03.306 --> 29:04.568
methodical,
reasoned.

29:04.612 --> 29:05.831
What'’s the problem, Gute?

29:05.874 --> 29:08.181
Other than a partner
who can barely contain

29:08.224 --> 29:09.748
her hostility, I don'’t know.

29:09.791 --> 29:11.140
Oh, I'’m not the hostile one.

29:11.184 --> 29:13.403
You punched me in the face
the first time we met.

29:13.447 --> 29:15.231
Tell you what,
if you can get Sofia'’s location

29:15.275 --> 29:18.104
out of Flaco in three minutes,
I'’ll give you one free shot.

29:18.147 --> 29:19.409
Be right here.

29:19.453 --> 29:20.584
Three minutes?

29:21.455 --> 29:23.413
All right.

29:23.457 --> 29:24.632
Mm-hmm. Sí. Okay,
I got it.

29:24.675 --> 29:26.286
Yeah. I know.Okay.

29:26.329 --> 29:27.417
BAILEY:
Uh-huh.

29:27.461 --> 29:29.768
Don'’t get up, Mr. Flaco.

29:29.811 --> 29:31.552
This won'’t take longer
than three minutes.

29:33.641 --> 29:36.296
♪

29:41.562 --> 29:43.607
You said, "Let'’s find Benny."

29:43.651 --> 29:44.783
Figure of speech.

29:44.826 --> 29:47.786
As in the two of us,
together.

29:47.829 --> 29:50.092
What I meant was,
let me handle this.

29:50.136 --> 29:53.443
The best thing you can do
is stay far away from this mess.

29:55.141 --> 29:56.969
You took care of my family.

29:57.012 --> 29:58.579
Let me take care of yours.

29:58.622 --> 30:00.320
MAYA: Mom, let'’s go!
Dad'’s here!

30:03.105 --> 30:04.150
Dad!

30:04.193 --> 30:05.804
Oh, careful, honey.

30:05.847 --> 30:07.501
Your dad is...No, no, no.

30:07.544 --> 30:09.546
It'’s fine. Hug away.

30:09.590 --> 30:10.547
Are you sure?

30:10.591 --> 30:11.766
You think
they'’d let me

30:11.810 --> 30:13.855
out of the hospital
if I wasn'’t okay?

30:13.899 --> 30:16.423
I was worried about you.

30:16.466 --> 30:17.641
You know what'’s good for worry?

30:17.685 --> 30:19.687
:
Candy?
Candy.

30:19.730 --> 30:21.428
That'’s my girl.

30:21.471 --> 30:23.430
Maya, could you give
me and Dad a minute?

30:23.473 --> 30:24.692
Mm-hmm.Thank you.

30:30.654 --> 30:32.308
Hey, Bailey. What'’s up?

30:32.352 --> 30:34.267
I may have a location on Sofia.

30:34.310 --> 30:36.486
Damn speedy, Bailey.

30:36.530 --> 30:40.186
Enhanced interrogation.
Do I need to worry?

30:40.229 --> 30:42.014
Not about the suspect.

30:43.493 --> 30:45.495
COLE:
I self-discharged.

30:45.539 --> 30:47.454
Who knows my body
better than me?

30:47.497 --> 30:49.760
Definitely not
trained doctors.

30:51.110 --> 30:52.633
Speaking of

30:52.676 --> 30:55.505
hospital-grade
painkillers...

30:56.942 --> 30:59.553
...you said some things
last night that were...

30:59.596 --> 31:00.989
hard to hear.

31:02.077 --> 31:03.600
About your haircut?

31:03.644 --> 31:05.037
My haircut?

31:05.080 --> 31:06.168
What? No.

31:06.212 --> 31:07.691
You didn'’t get a haircut?

31:07.735 --> 31:10.042
You really don'’t remember

31:10.085 --> 31:12.696
anything we talked
about last night?

31:16.962 --> 31:18.877
Maybe it'’ll come back to me.

31:20.791 --> 31:23.229
Well, if it does...

31:23.272 --> 31:25.927
we should talk.

31:32.978 --> 31:35.937
77 Lakeview Canyon Road,
Thousand Oaks.

31:35.981 --> 31:38.635
Flaco gave up
an address for Sofia.

31:38.679 --> 31:40.594
And I'’m coming with.

31:40.637 --> 31:43.031
Roger, we talked about this.

31:43.075 --> 31:44.206
Yeah, I know.

31:44.250 --> 31:45.947
I shouldn'’t be
anywhere near this mess,

31:45.991 --> 31:48.254
but the thing is,
this is my mess to clean up.

31:48.297 --> 31:51.300
But it'’s not. This started
way before you, with Barnes.

31:51.344 --> 31:52.867
I let Benny go.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.695
You'’re really digging in
on this.Yeah, and you know why?

31:54.738 --> 31:57.654
Because this is you
shooting out my tires again

31:57.698 --> 32:00.048
so that I
can'’t follow you, and...

32:00.092 --> 32:01.441
What are you doing?

32:01.484 --> 32:03.617
Writing an apology note.

32:03.660 --> 32:05.227
To who?To you.

32:05.271 --> 32:06.881
:
For what?

32:08.013 --> 32:10.145
For this.

32:10.189 --> 32:12.539
I got you.

32:16.456 --> 32:18.023
Take a little nap, buddy.

32:18.066 --> 32:19.763
Sorry, Roger.

32:24.507 --> 32:26.466
Hey. I need to see you.

32:26.509 --> 32:29.817
I know I'’m grounded, Dylan.

32:29.860 --> 32:31.950
Okay, see you in a minute.

32:55.538 --> 32:57.497
Hey. Whoa, whoa. I'’m impressed.

32:58.672 --> 33:00.630
You snuck out.RIANA: I did.

33:00.674 --> 33:03.198
My parents are
driving me insane.

33:03.242 --> 33:04.678
Damn, I'’m sorry, Ri.

33:04.721 --> 33:06.245
DYLAN:
What'’d they do now?

33:06.288 --> 33:07.637
RIANA:
Let'’s see.

33:07.681 --> 33:09.726
My mom constantly lawyers me,

33:09.770 --> 33:11.772
my dad can'’t seem to leave
his bad cop act

33:11.815 --> 33:12.947
at the office.

33:12.991 --> 33:14.949
DYLAN:
That is so unfair.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.690
They'’re just so critical.

33:16.733 --> 33:18.039
I mean, I did
something nice today,

33:18.083 --> 33:20.259
and my mom was
actually surprised.

33:20.302 --> 33:23.349
They just don'’t appreciate
how good they have it.

33:23.392 --> 33:25.177
And how perfect you are.

33:25.220 --> 33:28.658
RIANA: I mean, it'’s not like I
want to be a bad kid, you know?

33:28.702 --> 33:31.400
Mm

33:31.444 --> 33:32.880
God, you weren'’t even listening.

33:32.923 --> 33:34.708
Ah!

33:34.751 --> 33:36.101
Get your hands off my daughter.

33:36.144 --> 33:38.103
Holy crap.Dad, what are you doing here?

33:38.146 --> 33:40.235
I'’m watching.

33:40.279 --> 33:43.369
Always watching.

33:43.412 --> 33:44.718
Now get out. I'’m taking the car.

33:44.761 --> 33:48.069
Come on, get out the car!

34:15.836 --> 34:18.926
[gunfire,
men shouting in Spanish]

34:34.072 --> 34:36.161
Shh!

34:38.728 --> 34:40.121
Ow! Ugh...

34:40.165 --> 34:42.776
What is it with you and hands?

34:45.170 --> 34:47.824
Sofia, I'’m not here to kill you.

34:47.868 --> 34:49.348
Okay? Benny Avila is.

34:49.391 --> 34:51.132
Benny Avila'’s in prison.

34:51.176 --> 34:54.048
No, he'’s here. He's staging
a coup with the CIA'’s blessing.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.050
Why would you want to save me?

34:56.094 --> 34:57.965
COLE: Because if he kills
you, my partner goes down.

35:00.576 --> 35:02.187
No!

35:11.152 --> 35:12.893
Either you come
downtown with me,

35:12.936 --> 35:14.416
or you stay here
and Benny kills you.

35:19.291 --> 35:21.206
Get me out of here now.

35:40.747 --> 35:43.967
Come on. I'’ll catch you.

35:44.011 --> 35:47.014
Sofia, you have to trust me.

36:00.593 --> 36:02.160
You killed my husband.

36:04.249 --> 36:06.990
Yes. I did.

36:27.489 --> 36:29.578
Benny!

36:29.622 --> 36:31.841
Remember me?We had a deal.

36:31.885 --> 36:35.105
Yes, we did.
And I'’m a man of my word.

36:36.411 --> 36:38.892
Of course,
possession'’s another charge.

36:38.935 --> 36:41.024
Hey, Roger.

36:41.068 --> 36:42.243
What took you so long?

36:42.287 --> 36:45.594
Some smart-ass stole my car.

36:45.638 --> 36:47.292
Hmm.

36:51.600 --> 36:55.256
TRISH: Are you trying
to get in trouble?

36:55.300 --> 36:56.301
Mom, I...

36:56.344 --> 36:58.520
You waltzed in
at 12:30 last night.

36:58.564 --> 37:00.000
I needed some fresh air.

37:00.043 --> 37:01.828
Okay, well, at this
point, you'’re lucky

37:01.871 --> 37:04.613
that room of yours
has a window.

37:04.657 --> 37:06.572
One week just became four.Wait.

37:06.615 --> 37:08.617
You can'’t ground me
when I'’m already grounded.

37:08.661 --> 37:11.098
Like, isn'’t that some kind
of double jeopardy?

37:11.141 --> 37:13.056
Sorry. Separate charges.

37:13.100 --> 37:14.710
You guys started without me?Yeah.

37:14.754 --> 37:17.887
Glad you'’re up. Maybe you can
get through to your daughter.

37:17.931 --> 37:21.282
Dad, please. She'’s trying
to ground me for a month.

37:21.326 --> 37:25.286
Riana, your mother has every
right to be disappointed.

37:25.330 --> 37:26.200
Thank you, baby.

37:26.244 --> 37:28.637
MURTAUGH: That
being said,

37:28.681 --> 37:30.117
a month is a bit harsh.

37:30.160 --> 37:31.466
Thank you, Daddy.

37:31.510 --> 37:35.905
Provided we see some changes
in your dating habits.

37:35.949 --> 37:37.994
I already ended things
with Dylan.

37:38.038 --> 37:39.996
He'’s a terrible listener.

37:40.867 --> 37:43.348
What do you say,
Counselor?

37:43.391 --> 37:44.479
Two weeks?

37:53.358 --> 37:54.707
Mm-hmm.

37:54.750 --> 37:57.362
So, you gonna tell me
what happened last night?

37:58.450 --> 38:01.061
I plead the fifth.

38:11.898 --> 38:14.944
Got to say, I liked it better
when we were working together.

38:14.988 --> 38:16.511
You want your job back?

38:17.425 --> 38:20.515
I'’d rather be buried alive.

38:20.559 --> 38:22.735
And that'’s speaking
from experience, thanks to you.

38:22.778 --> 38:25.085
Look, I'’m sorry about that,
all right?

38:25.128 --> 38:29.045
But the Wesley I know wouldn'’t
have let it get that far.

38:29.089 --> 38:30.699
That guy doesn'’t exist anymore.

38:30.743 --> 38:33.528
It'’s amusing
that you think that.

38:35.443 --> 38:38.707
I gave up everything that
mattered to me because of you.

38:38.751 --> 38:41.319
My family.

38:41.362 --> 38:43.103
That'’s not gonna happen anymore.

38:43.146 --> 38:46.933
I mean, people come and go, Wes.

38:46.976 --> 38:50.632
Duty is all that matters.

38:53.679 --> 38:55.594
Not anymore.

38:55.637 --> 39:00.076
You mess with my partner again,
and I'’ll kill you.

39:00.120 --> 39:03.993
You'’re not the man
I thought you were.

39:06.387 --> 39:09.347
That'’s the nicest thing
you ever said to me.

39:13.263 --> 39:15.962
GUTE:
You asked to see me, Cap?

39:16.005 --> 39:17.050
Gute.

39:17.877 --> 39:19.487
Is it Gute or the Gute?

39:19.531 --> 39:20.880
Whichever. I'’m fine, whatever.

39:20.923 --> 39:22.621
I just wanted to officially
welcome you aboard.

39:22.664 --> 39:24.318
Seems like you and Bailey
really hit your stride

39:24.362 --> 39:27.452
on the Vasquez case.Yeah, you could say that.

39:27.495 --> 39:28.975
Did you hear
we found Benny Avila?

39:29.018 --> 39:30.585
News to me. Where was he?

39:30.629 --> 39:33.371
Second stall,
second floor bathroom.

39:33.414 --> 39:34.981
I walked in, opened the door,

39:35.024 --> 39:36.852
there he was.

39:36.896 --> 39:38.376
That'’s crazy.
Isn'’t it?

39:38.419 --> 39:41.379
Crazy, right? I mean, I...
He says he had been hiding

39:41.422 --> 39:42.989
in there all night,
but that'’s a lie,

39:43.032 --> 39:44.817
because just two
hours earlier,

39:44.860 --> 39:47.123
I was in that very same stall.

39:47.167 --> 39:48.864
Everything okay?

39:48.908 --> 39:50.475
It'’s almost like someone put him

39:50.518 --> 39:52.346
exactly where they knew
I would find him.

39:52.390 --> 39:55.610
Someone with, say, insight
into my stall preferences.

39:55.654 --> 39:58.134
Don'’t look at me.
I'’m new here, so...

39:58.178 --> 39:59.440
True.

39:59.484 --> 40:00.833
And you want to start off
on the right foot.

40:00.876 --> 40:02.138
Course.

40:02.182 --> 40:04.010
So is there anything
you want to tell me?

40:04.053 --> 40:06.360
No.

40:06.404 --> 40:09.145
You'’re not covering for anyone?

40:09.189 --> 40:10.843
Murtaugh, maybe?

40:10.886 --> 40:13.759
Listen, I don'’t know
how he got there.

40:13.802 --> 40:15.543
Head injury and all.

40:16.892 --> 40:18.677
But I think I know
what you'’re saying, Cap.

40:18.720 --> 40:20.418
You do?Mm-hmm.

40:20.461 --> 40:22.550
Stay away from stall two, right?

40:23.682 --> 40:27.686
Yeah.Will do.
