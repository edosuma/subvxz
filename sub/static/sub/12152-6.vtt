Cordelia's shacking up

You're going back to him,
aren't you?

FRED: <i>It was Professor Seidel.</i>
<i>He sent me to Pylea.</i>

00:13.173 --> 00:15.050
- He's gonna pay.
- He's gonna die.

00:15.253 --> 00:16.845
Back out if you think Gunn's right.

00:17.013 --> 00:19.732
Charles doesn't have it in him.
It's what I love about him.

00:20.693 --> 00:22.923
Fred, no!
You kill him, I'm gonna lose you.

- The professor?
- It's taken care of.

Youth, is there anything
more magical?

01:05.773 --> 01:10.324
A time of first loves, great discoveries.
Let's face it, youth is it.

01:10.533 --> 01:13.047
It's a national obsession, crazy cats.

01:13.253 --> 01:16.689
But somewhere, people all forget
what a mess youth is.

01:16.853 --> 01:20.482
It's a time of magic, all right.
And there's nothing more unreliable...

01:20.653 --> 01:24.089
...or annoying than magic.
Let me tell you a little story.

01:24.253 --> 01:25.925
It starts with a kid.

01:31.253 --> 01:33.608
LORNE:
No, actually, it really starts here.

01:35.133 --> 01:37.089
Were we in love?

01:37.453 --> 01:38.772
Hm.

01:39.813 --> 01:42.008
- Were we?
- What?

01:42.173 --> 01:43.765
In love.

01:44.133 --> 01:45.566
With each other?

01:45.733 --> 01:49.203
- Lf you start giving me the runaround...
- I'm not. I'm not!

01:49.373 --> 01:52.763
- Then tell me the truth.
- I don't know.

01:52.973 --> 01:55.328
- You don't know?
- Well, I'm not sure.

01:55.533 --> 01:57.842
I think that's the sort of thing
I'd remember.

01:58.053 --> 02:01.250
Hey, maybe you wrote it down
somewhere. A note on the fridge maybe?

02:01.453 --> 02:05.287
I had feelings for you.
And I thought that maybe you...

02:06.053 --> 02:07.850
But you never told me.

02:08.573 --> 02:12.407
You asked me to meet you to talk...

02:13.173 --> 02:16.404
...and I never saw you again.
- And you think I wanted to tell you...

02:16.573 --> 02:19.167
...I was in love with you.
- I don't think you're ready...

02:19.373 --> 02:22.251
Or maybe I was gonna
tell you to back off, buddy.

Maybe you were coming on
too strong.

Harassing me in the workplace.

02:28.813 --> 02:32.169
Maybe I had a red-hot
restraining order in my mitts.

02:32.373 --> 02:35.251
- You ever think of that?
- It was never in the workplace. I...

02:35.413 --> 02:38.166
Well, there was that one time
with the ballet...

02:38.333 --> 02:41.131
...and the stripping and the roundness,
but that was a spell!

02:41.293 --> 02:44.524
And we were meeting on the bluffs.
That's a romantic restraining order!

02:44.693 --> 02:46.251
You're yelling at me!

02:46.933 --> 02:47.968
I'm not.

02:48.133 --> 02:51.045
See, this is why I don't
wanna answer questions...

...I don't have the answers for.

02:57.133 --> 03:00.045
All I know is that
you were my dearest friend.

03:01.533 --> 03:05.208
And I hope that...
I just... I want that back.

03:07.853 --> 03:09.366
That much, at least.

03:16.813 --> 03:20.726
You have no idea how much
this is killing me.

03:23.053 --> 03:25.521
I know my ABC's, my history.

03:25.693 --> 03:28.412
I know who's president,
and that I sort of wish I didn't.

03:28.613 --> 03:31.332
I know the name of every shoe store
in the Beverly Center...

03:31.493 --> 03:33.290
...but I don't...

03:35.013 --> 03:39.325

the sound of my own name.

Look, I promise you
we will get you back.

Who is "we," paleface? I'm the one
out there doing all the legwork.

03:49.973 --> 03:53.204
Well, it's really more lap-work,
because guess what just fell into it.

03:53.373 --> 03:55.170
- What?
- A memory spell...

...provided by one of my clients,
guaranteed to bring our Cordy back...

03:58.733 --> 04:00.405
...to the way she was.

04:01.093 --> 04:03.687
- Guaranteed?
- No pain, no side effects.

04:03.893 --> 04:07.363
I'm telling you, swingers,
there's no way this can fail.

04:08.693 --> 04:11.287

Spin the Bottle

05:05.173 --> 05:07.892
Well, I had every reason
to believe this spell would work.

05:08.053 --> 05:11.045
And it did, after a fashion.

05:13.653 --> 05:15.530
What happened during it...

05:15.693 --> 05:17.763
...and what came after...

Ooh.

05:20.293 --> 05:22.124
I'm gonna need a bigger drink.

05:22.293 --> 05:26.366
But the spell was legit, straight up.
I had it off this wraith. Sweet girl.

05:26.533 --> 05:29.764
Not overly tangible, but she deals
in memory spells professionally.

05:29.933 --> 05:31.969

that with the right mix...

- I don't care.

remember I'm moussaka.

No, it's Pylean, crumpet.

I said, "I may be prepared
to shout a joyful chant."

And I said,
"May your words please the gods."

Did you...?

08:01.333 --> 08:02.846

First, she didn't say,
"May your words please the gods"...

08:06.053 --> 08:10.205
...so much as, "May you orally
please the gods," which is a slight...

that Wesley had helped her.

And Wesley didn't know Gunn
had killed the guy to save Fred...

08:32.373 --> 08:33.772
...from becoming a killer.

08:33.933 --> 08:36.811
And Fred didn't know that
Gunn was right then figuring out...

08:36.972 --> 08:39.009
...that Wesley had helped her try.

08:39.212 --> 08:42.171
So you can see, I didn't have
all the facts when I started this.

in this clan was exactly singing.

We're almost ready.

So you're perfectly okay with just
wandering into my room any old time?

That fits the "we were in love" theory
and the "harassment" theory...

...pretty much equally.

all be answered soon.

It's his world.

Don't got that champion's heart like

What about Fred?

10:12.013 --> 10:13.924
Well, that's the question, isn't it?

10:16.333 --> 10:18.528
She's pretty brainy too.

10:18.693 --> 10:21.685
Maybe you two are kindred souls.

10:22.493 --> 10:26.372
Maybe that's why she went to you for
help getting revenge on that professor.

What I would do for her.

10:37.973 --> 10:40.168

I should need to know?

You think I don't know
why you keep coming back here?

27:56.893 --> 27:58.804
But I assure you,
this is demonic work.

27:59.453 --> 28:03.844
And they're not nearly
so exploratory.

28:05.093 --> 28:06.731
Don't be afraid.

28:06.893 --> 28:09.361
Ain't nothing here.
It's getting old.

28:09.533 --> 28:12.127
Well, let's not give up probe.

28:15.053 --> 28:17.328
Hope, give up hope.

28:17.533 --> 28:19.330
We're not...

28:28.813 --> 28:31.646
- Any luck?
- Saw no vampires of any kind anywhere.

28:32.173 --> 28:35.245
WESLEY: Did you check every room?
- The ones that wanted turn-down service.

28:35.413 --> 28:37.722
There's five floors. My feet hurt.

28:37.893 --> 28:39.724
- You finish.
- This is a waste of time.

28:39.893 --> 28:42.168
I agree.
There's nothing here.

28:42.333 --> 28:46.611
This place is evil. I think that
I should leave now because of the evil.

28:46.773 --> 28:49.571
- Don't be a fool!
- Good luck, all.

28:51.453 --> 28:53.603
- So we're all locked in, huh?
- Excuse me.

28:53.773 --> 28:58.563
Did I just get the brush off?
Did a guy just bail on me?

28:58.813 --> 29:01.122
There really is
some sort of horrible spell.

29:01.333 --> 29:03.005
Do you think Liam's okay out there?

29:03.173 --> 29:05.892
Something's eating him,
at least he ain't as bored as me.

29:06.053 --> 29:07.645
Joke all you like.

29:08.373 --> 29:11.888
Liam, right now, may be facing horrors
he's never even imagined.

Liam!

29:26.573 --> 29:28.291
- Demons!
- Really?

29:28.493 --> 29:29.608
Told you.

29:29.813 --> 29:33.283
- How many?
- Hundreds, screaming.

29:33.493 --> 29:36.212
- Will they try to get in?
- I don't think they saw me.

29:36.373 --> 29:38.443
I guess we really better
solve this puzzle.

29:39.133 --> 29:42.250
- What type of demons, would you say?
- Shiny.

29:44.013 --> 29:46.129
Yep, I still got it.

29:46.333 --> 29:49.211
So we gotta check the rooms?
Because I'm bored just saying it.

29:49.413 --> 29:51.768
Wouldn't the vampire
be coming after us anyhow?

29:51.973 --> 29:53.247
Aren't we vittles?

29:53.453 --> 29:55.125
WESLEY:
And he should be starving.

29:55.773 --> 29:59.243
But I also happen to think that further
searching would be pointless.

29:59.413 --> 30:02.166
I think the council has been
far cleverer than I imagined.

30:02.333 --> 30:05.166
- Ooh. How?
- Yeah, speech, speech.

30:05.333 --> 30:09.372
Five people, each unknown
to each other, far from home...

30:09.573 --> 30:12.041
...trapped together at night.

30:12.213 --> 30:16.764
I submit that the bloodsucking fiend
may be closer than we dared suspect.

30:16.973 --> 30:18.611
- It may be...
- I'll search the rooms.

30:18.813 --> 30:21.850
- I was getting to the good part!
- Can't just wait for the vampire.

30:22.013 --> 30:24.925
- I'll just flush him out and...
- That it may be one of us!

30:25.133 --> 30:27.772
- Ugh. You're kidding.
WESLEY: Would that I were, Miss Chase.

30:27.973 --> 30:29.804
But the simple fact is...

30:30.013 --> 30:33.403
...the fiend has been
under our noses the entire time...

30:33.573 --> 30:35.643
...waiting for the moment to strike!

30:38.733 --> 30:42.931
See? The English is stupid.
Let's have a different theory.

30:43.133 --> 30:44.566
I'm not quite finished.

30:46.813 --> 30:49.327
I think it's only fair
that everyone has a turn.

30:49.493 --> 30:53.372
The cross obviously doesn't affect me
or our friend the pugilist.

We were hoping you would
enlighten us, spawn of evil.

Oh, dear. I'm starting to suspect my
sure-fire, hit spell closed out of town.

Did Cordy at least get her memory back?

where the vampire is, fiend.

you left me alone with him, genius?

- So clearly, deviant.
