00:02.252 --> 00:04.169
Dad wants us to pick up
where he left off:

00:04.337 --> 00:07.006
Saving people, hunting things.

00:07.632 --> 00:08.632
The family business.

00:09.676 --> 00:12.302
You were the bank robber
on the 11:00 news, not me.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.805
- Yeah?
- This is Agent Victor Henricksen.

00:14.973 --> 00:17.766
My job's to bring you in.
Alive's a bonus, but not necessary.

00:17.934 --> 00:20.686
I've been looking for you for weeks.
And I know about Sam.

00:20.854 --> 00:23.939
I know about the murder in St. Louis,
the Houdini act in Baltimore.

00:24.107 --> 00:27.609
I know about the desecrations
and the thefts.

00:27.777 --> 00:29.111
I know about your dad.

00:29.279 --> 00:30.904
You don't know crap about my dad.

00:33.074 --> 00:34.616
We are so screwed.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074

00:58.641 --> 01:00.309
Well, this makes a lot of sense.

01:00.477 --> 01:04.146
First, they close down the cellblock
and now they open it back up again.

01:04.313 --> 01:06.815
There's your tax dollars at work, huh?

01:09.319 --> 01:10.402
Here.

01:12.572 --> 01:14.323
You got that ready?

01:26.920 --> 01:28.587
Yikes.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.464
Would hate to have gotten
thrown in here.

01:37.847 --> 01:40.682
- Hey, you feel that, man?
- What?

01:44.020 --> 01:47.064
Whoa. What was that?

02:25.228 --> 02:26.603
Uh...

02:32.068 --> 02:33.694
Hey.

02:33.862 --> 02:35.237
Hey, guard. Hey.

02:51.588 --> 02:52.754
Come on, man.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.424
Hey. Guard.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.385
Come here. Come on. Help me.

02:58.553 --> 03:01.221
Going down to B block. Randall again.

03:01.639 --> 03:04.057
Copy that.
Come on, man.

03:05.226 --> 03:07.978
- Hey. Guard, hey.
Shut up, old man.

03:08.146 --> 03:09.938
Come on. I'm trying to sleep.

03:10.106 --> 03:12.691
You telling me you didn't see that?
What are you, blind?

03:12.859 --> 03:13.859
Hey!

03:15.528 --> 03:17.112
Randall, cool it.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.239
Cool it, my ass.
There's somebody there.

03:19.407 --> 03:22.451
Turn out your light and go to sleep.
I'm not gonna say it again.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.620
Yeah, Randall, shut up.

03:43.139 --> 03:44.264
Lights out, B block.

03:44.432 --> 03:46.892
Copy that. Lights out.

03:47.393 --> 03:49.269
Good night, ladies.

04:23.179 --> 04:26.306
- Aah! God!
What's going on, man?

04:28.685 --> 04:30.811
What's going on?

04:35.984 --> 04:39.278
No. No. No.

04:39.445 --> 04:42.489
No! No! No!

04:42.657 --> 04:46.493
No! No! No!

04:46.661 --> 04:49.705
Aah, no!

05:10.727 --> 05:12.269
This way.

05:16.774 --> 05:17.983
I hate this plan, Dean.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.277
Yeah, I got that
the first 10 times I heard it.

06:04.822 --> 06:07.741
Freeze.
Don't move.

06:07.909 --> 06:10.285
I said freeze!
Hold it right there.

06:10.912 --> 06:14.956
Put your hands behind your heads.
Sit down on your knees. Now.

06:15.124 --> 06:16.833
I got them.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.128
- Hands behind your back.
The other hand.

06:27.345 --> 06:29.888
Front. To the right.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.682
I call this one the "Blue Steel."

06:32.850 --> 06:36.311
Yeah, that's great. To the right.
Okay, back to the lineup.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.605
- Who looks better, me or Nick Nolte?
- Shut up.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.989
Well, it's about time.
I'll have a cheeseburger.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.410
Extra onions.

06:53.996 --> 06:56.915
You think you're funny.
- I think I'm adorable.

06:57.333 --> 07:00.168
It is a pleasure to finally meet you
in person, Dean.

07:02.171 --> 07:06.007
I'm Special Agent Victor Henricksen.
This is my partner, Special Agent Reidy.

07:08.136 --> 07:12.264
Henricksen.
Not the Milwaukee Agent Henricksen.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.182
Live and in person.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.017
Ha.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.771
Oh, nice shot.

07:21.065 --> 07:23.275
You can hang that up in your cell
at Supermax.

07:23.568 --> 07:26.069
All right, maybe we can just forget
the cheeseburgers, huh?

07:26.237 --> 07:29.322
Oh, yeah. Keep that game face on.

07:29.490 --> 07:33.243
Try and cover up how cornered you are.
Read him the charges.

07:33.411 --> 07:36.955
Well, we got mail fraud, credit card fraud,
grave desecration.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.206
Skip to the good ones.

07:39.250 --> 07:43.545
Armed robbery, kidnapping,
and, oh, three counts of first-degree murder.

07:43.713 --> 07:47.215
And after Milwaukee, your brother is now
a suspect in a murder case himself.

07:47.383 --> 07:51.553
I'd say for you two, "screwed to hell"
is a major understatement.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.097
Well, where there's life,
there's hope, huh?

07:54.265 --> 07:56.933
Ah, see, that's what I kept thinking...

07:57.101 --> 07:59.895
...as I was searching for your assess
all over hell and gone.

08:02.773 --> 08:03.940
Your dad taught you well.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.068
The way you cover your tracks.
And after Milwaukee, the way you...

08:08.404 --> 08:10.071
...vanished.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.407
Near went nuts trying to find you.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.744
- Ask him.
- He near went nuts.

08:16.204 --> 08:19.956
And after all of that, you get tripped up
on a motion detector.

08:22.126 --> 08:23.585
Pretty rookie move.

08:23.753 --> 08:26.254
Gotta say, I was...

08:26.422 --> 08:27.422
...surprised.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.846
- Dean Winchester?
- In the flesh.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.182
- And you are?
- Mara Daniels, Public Defender's Office.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.183
I've been assigned you
and your brother's case.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.352
Oh.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.772
- Are you Henricksen?
- Yeah, and we're not quite done here.

08:44.273 --> 08:46.274
Uh, yeah, you are.

08:46.442 --> 08:47.943
And if you don't mind...

08:48.110 --> 08:50.987
...I would like
to meet with my clients, privately.

08:54.659 --> 08:57.953
Unfortunately, your arraignment
on the breaking and entering charge...

08:58.120 --> 08:59.120
...won't be until Tuesday.

08:59.288 --> 09:01.623
- And they'll keep us in the county jail?
- That's right.

09:01.791 --> 09:03.959
- Green River County Detention Center?
- Yes.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.628
And considering the charges
you're facing...

09:06.796 --> 09:08.505
...no judge is going to grant bail.

09:09.423 --> 09:11.299
Yeah, we figured that.

09:11.467 --> 09:15.303
Extradition papers have already been filed
from five separate states.

09:15.471 --> 09:17.639
Missouri and Wisconsin
being the biggest...

09:17.807 --> 09:19.516
...the robbery and the murder raps.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.476
How long can we stall extradition?

09:22.812 --> 09:25.230
A week. Maybe less.

09:31.737 --> 09:34.823
All right, let's go. Watch your step.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.033
Come on. Keep moving.

09:56.304 --> 09:59.055
- You're mine, baby.
Looking good, move it along.

09:59.223 --> 10:03.059
Don't worry, Sam,
I promise I won't trade you for smokes.

10:23.372 --> 10:24.748
I call top bunk.

10:28.544 --> 10:29.919
Okay.

10:50.399 --> 10:52.901
My roommate
doesn't say much, how's yours?

10:53.069 --> 10:55.153
He just keeps staring at me...

10:55.321 --> 10:58.323
...in a way that makes me really uneasy.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.618
- It sounds like you're making new friends.
- Dean.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.622
This is, without a doubt, the dumbest,
craziest thing we've ever done.

11:05.790 --> 11:08.458
And that's in a long, storied career
of dumb and crazy.

11:08.626 --> 11:11.002
Calm down. It's all part of the plan.

11:11.170 --> 11:14.089
Oh, really? So Henricksen
showing up was part of the plan?

11:14.590 --> 11:17.092
Yeah, that guy moves
a little faster than I thought.

11:17.259 --> 11:20.595
Look, all we gotta do is find this ghost,
put the sucker down...

11:20.763 --> 11:23.139
...then grab ourselves
a couple of teardrop tattoos.

11:23.307 --> 11:24.933
That's not funny.

11:25.476 --> 11:27.602
Dean, what about this escape plan? It-?

11:27.770 --> 11:30.146
It's 100-percent sure.
I wouldn't have gone in if it wasn't.

11:31.399 --> 11:34.526
I mean, come on, man,
this place has all the signs of a haunting.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.946
- Innocent people are dead. Four so far.
- Yeah, innocent.

11:38.906 --> 11:42.033
You from Texas all of the sudden?
Just because people are in jail...

11:42.201 --> 11:44.994
...doesn't mean they deserve to die.
If we don't stop this...

11:45.162 --> 11:48.289
...people are gonna continue to.
We do the job wherever it takes us.

11:48.457 --> 11:50.709
Look, Dean,
just be straight with me, all right?

11:51.836 --> 11:54.170
- You're doing this for Deacon.
- Damn right.

11:54.338 --> 11:55.964
Well, you barely even know the guy.

11:56.966 --> 12:00.635
We know he was in the corps with dad.
He saved Dad's life. We owe him.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.138
But don't you think
he's asking a little much?

12:03.305 --> 12:04.973
It doesn't matter.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.934
We may not be saints,
but we're loyal and we pay our debts.

12:08.102 --> 12:11.146
Now, that means something to me
and it ought to you.

12:11.856 --> 12:15.150
I'm not thrilled about this either,
but Deacon asked us to hunt this...

12:15.317 --> 12:16.985
...and that's what we're gonna do.

12:22.825 --> 12:26.035
- You know, this chicken isn't half bad.
- Great. Finish mine.

12:27.496 --> 12:29.247
All right, so let's go back over this.

12:29.415 --> 12:32.041
Spirit suspect number one
is Mark Moody, right?

12:32.209 --> 12:35.837
Yeah. Psycho-killer extraordinaire.
Satanism. Ritual murder. Died in jail.

12:36.005 --> 12:37.839
- Are you sure it's him?
- Pretty sure.

12:38.007 --> 12:42.177
Dean, considering our circumstances,
I'm gonna need a bit better than pretty sure.

12:42.344 --> 12:43.678
Really pretty sure.

12:45.765 --> 12:49.350
Moody died of a heart attack, which is
what the victims in here are dying of.

12:49.518 --> 12:53.188
He died in the old cellblock, which they
closed after he croaked, 30 years ago.

12:53.355 --> 12:55.774
They opened that back up,
the killings started.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.859
You think his spirit
was released somehow?

12:58.068 --> 12:59.068
Mm-hm.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.237
What if he was already cremated?

13:01.405 --> 13:04.699
I'm guessing there's something
that belongs to him keeping him around.

13:04.867 --> 13:08.787
Whatever it is, we gotta find it,
and you know the rest. I'm done.

13:16.712 --> 13:18.546
- Sorry, I-
- Watch where you're going.

13:18.714 --> 13:20.799
- Yeah, sure, I just-
- He said he was sorry.

13:20.966 --> 13:24.135
Dean.
- You talking to me?

13:25.638 --> 13:27.055
Are you talking to me?

13:28.098 --> 13:31.434
Great, another guy who's seen Taxi Driver.
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.562
Trust me. Let it go.

13:37.775 --> 13:39.234
Dean, come on.

13:39.985 --> 13:42.070
See, that's how you gotta talk
to these guys.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.321
Instant respect.

13:47.284 --> 13:48.284
You were saying?

13:51.747 --> 13:52.956
Oh, great.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.502
We can end this right now.
No harm, no foul.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.469
That's enough!

14:08.138 --> 14:09.514
On your feet, Lucas.

14:11.976 --> 14:13.643
Yes, sir, boss.

14:20.317 --> 14:22.944
- What's your name?
- Winchester.

14:23.112 --> 14:26.447
Well, Winchester, not a good start.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.123
Solitary.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.458
You too, Lucas.

14:38.335 --> 14:41.170
Yes, sir.
- Are we having fun yet, huh?

15:03.485 --> 15:05.194
I wish I had a baseball.

15:06.363 --> 15:07.655
What?

15:07.823 --> 15:11.659
- What did you say?
- I said I wish I had a baseball.

15:11.952 --> 15:14.329
You know, like Steve McQueen.

15:14.496 --> 15:19.083
Yeah. Well, I wish I had a bat,
so I could bash your fricking head in.

15:20.544 --> 15:21.920
Okay.

15:22.421 --> 15:25.840
Well, so much
for the bonding-in-solitary moment.

15:40.731 --> 15:42.440
Oh, crap.

15:56.538 --> 15:59.958
Lucas, listen to me. Stay very still.

16:29.113 --> 16:32.281
Aaarggh!

16:44.461 --> 16:46.004
Henricksen?

16:46.171 --> 16:47.755
Hey, Daniels.

16:47.923 --> 16:48.965
Can I have a word?

16:49.758 --> 16:51.968
Have a seat. What's on your mind?

16:52.136 --> 16:55.388
I've been going through the Winchester
charges, and I gotta say...

16:55.556 --> 16:57.765
...there are some weird inconsistencies.

16:57.933 --> 16:59.434
Welcome to my world.

16:59.601 --> 17:02.812
I talked to a cop in Baltimore
who swears up and down...

17:02.980 --> 17:06.148
...these boys saved her life,
and helped her catch a killer.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.818
There's a witness
to your robbery in Milwaukee...

17:08.986 --> 17:11.738
- ...she swears Sam and Dean saved her life.
- From what?

17:11.905 --> 17:14.866
- She was a little unclear on that.
- That's because she's nuts.

17:16.242 --> 17:19.037
I was in Milwaukee.
I spoke to her, to all the witnesses.

17:19.788 --> 17:22.040
- And?
- And, all I know is...

17:22.207 --> 17:26.002
...wherever these guys go, people die.
It's that simple.

17:26.170 --> 17:28.253
I don't know that it is.

17:28.589 --> 17:31.215
They just don't seem cut-and-dry
guilty to me.

17:31.592 --> 17:35.094
- I think there's more to this.
- Like what?

17:35.262 --> 17:36.971
I don't know.

17:37.389 --> 17:38.765
I can't put my finger on it.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.600
It's just...

17:41.643 --> 17:42.852
...strange.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.812
Strange?

17:45.814 --> 17:48.316
Yeah, okay.

17:50.527 --> 17:54.655
Grownups are trying to get some
work done here, so if you don't mind...

18:11.840 --> 18:13.007
How you doing?

18:15.803 --> 18:19.680
I'm 54 years old, mopping the floor
of a crapper with bars on the windows.

18:19.848 --> 18:21.891
How you think I'm doing?

18:23.685 --> 18:25.353
All right.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.563
Bad ice-breaker.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.107
I'm Sam.

18:30.275 --> 18:33.111
- Randall.
- Nice to meet you.

18:33.278 --> 18:36.280
Randall? Hey, weren't you there
the night that guard died?

18:37.741 --> 18:40.159
- Yeah.
- Well, what happened?

18:40.702 --> 18:42.954
They say the stress of the job got him.

18:43.122 --> 18:45.623
Yeah? What do you say?

18:51.046 --> 18:53.631
Why are you inside, kid?

18:57.553 --> 19:00.513
Because I got an idiot for a brother.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.099
- That'll do it.
- Yeah.

19:03.892 --> 19:05.685
Well, this place ain't so bad.

19:05.853 --> 19:08.104
Compared to the old cellblock,
this is the Hilton.

19:10.190 --> 19:12.191
You spent time in the old block?

19:12.359 --> 19:14.694
Oh, yeah, I was a regular customer.

19:14.862 --> 19:18.447
- Didn't they have Mark Moody for a while?
- He was there.

19:19.449 --> 19:21.868
I was there too,
the night that lunatic bought it.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.329
Yeah. It was a heart attack, right?

19:26.123 --> 19:29.959
His heart stopped after the guards
stopped using his head for batting practice.

19:31.587 --> 19:34.964
Next morning, I was in his cell
mopping up the blood. What a mess.

19:35.132 --> 19:38.301
Wait, so he was beaten
and nobody reported it?

19:38.677 --> 19:43.431
You kept your mouth shut unless you
wanted to die from the same heart attack.

19:46.476 --> 19:48.019
Randall...

19:48.187 --> 19:50.771
...exactly how much blood was there?

19:53.567 --> 19:54.942
Call.

19:55.652 --> 19:56.903
Three aces.

19:59.698 --> 20:01.657
That's a bad beat.

20:01.825 --> 20:04.660
That's bad beat, but see, I'm full.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.246
Threes over aces.

20:07.414 --> 20:10.416
Ha-ha. I'm sorry.
Hey, it's a cruel game, my friend.

20:14.630 --> 20:16.464
Sorry, guys.

20:20.552 --> 20:23.471
- It's like picking low-hanging fruit.
- You don't even smoke.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.765
You kidding?
This is the currency of the realm.

20:27.684 --> 20:30.269
Look, I got a good lead on Moody.
- Yeah, me too.

20:30.437 --> 20:32.605
- His spirit paid a visit last night.
- What?

20:33.065 --> 20:37.276
Clock-stop, flickering lights, cold spot.
I mean, he did everything but yell, "Boo."

20:37.444 --> 20:39.695
- What happened?
- He walked right by me.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.740
Lucas wasn't so lucky.
I mean, the way he was screaming...

20:42.908 --> 20:45.576
The guy was a jerk,
but he didn't deserve to go like that.

20:46.119 --> 20:47.286
What did you find out?

20:47.454 --> 20:50.248
Yeah, so I think I know
where we might find his remains.

20:50.415 --> 20:53.084
- Blood in his old cell.
- I thought it was a heart attack.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.835
After the guards worked him over.

20:55.003 --> 20:58.047
Apparently there was so much blood,
they had trouble mopping it out.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.966
How we gonna get in?

21:00.133 --> 21:02.009
I got a plan.

21:02.511 --> 21:03.886
That's the Sammy I know.

21:04.054 --> 21:06.806
You're like Clint Eastwood
from Escape From Alcatraz.

21:06.974 --> 21:09.684
Problem is, if we find something,
how are we gonna burn it?

21:09.851 --> 21:11.185
We don't have any accelerant.

21:12.020 --> 21:15.356
Good thing I'm like James Garner
from The Great Escape.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.820
Hey, fellas, who's ready to deal?

21:24.199 --> 21:27.785
- You sure about this?
- Pretty sure.

21:27.953 --> 21:31.914
Yeah, well, considering the circumstances,
I'd like a little better than pretty sure.

21:32.082 --> 21:34.208
Okay, really pretty sure.

21:35.711 --> 21:38.129
I'd like mine al dente.

21:40.924 --> 21:41.924
Perfect.

21:44.553 --> 21:47.013
Save room for dessert, Tiny.
Ha-ha-ha.

21:47.180 --> 21:48.973
Hey, I wanted to ask you...

21:49.141 --> 21:52.018
...because I couldn't help but notice
you are two tons of fun.

21:52.436 --> 21:56.647
Just curious, is that a thyroid problem or is
that some deep-seated self-esteem issue?

21:59.026 --> 22:01.402
Because, you know,
they're, uh, just doughnuts.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.279
They're not love.

22:27.137 --> 22:28.971
Guys, give me a hand.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.976
Get him off.

22:55.248 --> 22:59.001
- If we waited any longer, you'd be dead.
- You waited long enough.

23:01.088 --> 23:04.965
Do yourself a favor. Don't talk.

23:05.509 --> 23:07.510
Take them both up to the infirmary.

24:03.775 --> 24:06.444
- Hey, Tiny.
- Yeah?

24:07.612 --> 24:10.698
Hey, sorry about the things
I was saying earlier.

24:11.491 --> 24:14.702
I can't really tell you why,
but I had to get you angry.

24:15.078 --> 24:16.495
So...

24:17.205 --> 24:20.249
- Anyway, sorry.
- It's okay.

24:20.542 --> 24:23.878
The truth is,
I have low self-esteem issues.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.465
My old man treated me
and my brother like crap.

24:27.883 --> 24:29.425
Right up until the day he died.

24:29.885 --> 24:31.010
How'd he die?

24:31.344 --> 24:32.720
My brother shot him.

24:34.222 --> 24:35.890
Okay.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.689
- Oh, crap.
- What is it?

25:04.961 --> 25:06.128
What's going on?

25:16.473 --> 25:18.265
Oh, God.

25:18.433 --> 25:19.975
What is it?

25:43.458 --> 25:45.834
No!
Tiny.

25:46.044 --> 25:47.586
Tiny!

25:48.463 --> 25:50.089
Guard!

25:50.924 --> 25:52.633
Guard!

25:58.306 --> 26:00.140
Wait, you're telling me it wasn't Moody?

26:00.308 --> 26:02.685
Unless he liked going around
dressed like a nurse.

26:02.852 --> 26:05.145
Poor Tiny, man. Poor, giant Tiny.

26:05.313 --> 26:08.482
So this is like the ghost of some
nurse who worked here or something?

26:08.650 --> 26:10.985
- I don't know, I guess.
- "I don't know, I guess"...

26:11.152 --> 26:14.363
...isn't really working for me.
See, I thought we were done.

26:14.531 --> 26:17.241
I called Deacon, it's happening.
We're getting out tonight.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.577
I guess we gotta do
some quick research, then.

26:19.744 --> 26:24.623
How? I mean, maybe you haven't noticed,
we're in jail.

26:24.791 --> 26:27.167
So you wanna know about some nurse?

26:27.335 --> 26:29.461
- Why do you wanna know?
We got our reasons.

26:29.629 --> 26:32.840
But we'll make it worth your while.

26:37.345 --> 26:40.806
So this nurse, she would have had
white hair, one screwed-up eye.

26:40.974 --> 26:42.975
- Is that ringing a bell?
- Yeah.

26:43.143 --> 26:44.393
Yeah, I remember her.

26:44.561 --> 26:48.188
- You remember her name?
- No, that's still kind of fuzzy.

26:54.571 --> 26:55.738
Give it to him.

26:56.197 --> 26:58.782
- I earned these.
- Dean.

27:05.874 --> 27:08.459
Glockner. Nurse Glockner.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.754
- Nasty old bitch worked here in the '70s.
- You know her?

27:11.921 --> 27:14.340
I met her once.
I had to get a tetanus shot.

27:14.507 --> 27:16.967
She damn near jabbed the needle
through my arm.

27:17.135 --> 27:19.928
- At least I got out of there alive.
- What do you mean?

27:20.889 --> 27:23.390
There were stories,
I don't know if they were true.

27:23.558 --> 27:26.560
- Cons love to talk, but we're all liars.
- What kind of stories?

27:26.728 --> 27:31.023
Guys would go up with a cold,
next thing, they're in a body bag.

27:31.191 --> 27:34.068
A whole rash of heart attacks.
Young guys. Old guys.

27:34.235 --> 27:35.736
- Heart attacks?
- Yeah. The story was...

27:35.904 --> 27:37.571
...Glockner had it out for cons...

27:37.739 --> 27:42.910
...and she did this Charles Bronson thing
with a hypodermic.

27:43.078 --> 27:45.162
That was the rumor.
Nobody proved anything.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.623
- So whatever happened to Glockner?
- I don't know.

27:47.791 --> 27:49.083
I finished my bit and left.

27:49.250 --> 27:51.710
Next time I landed back in here,
she was gone.

27:52.420 --> 27:54.505
Let's say those stories
on Glockner were true.

27:54.673 --> 27:58.008
It's a thought. In life she's a vigilante.
In death, same thing.

27:58.176 --> 28:00.427
But how's she tied in
with the old cellblock?

28:00.595 --> 28:02.763
If she's going after cons,
why kill that guard?

28:02.931 --> 28:06.016
I did hear in the yard
that guard wasn't exactly squeaky clean.

28:06.184 --> 28:09.895
So, well, maybe she's going after anybody
that breaks the law, like me.

28:10.605 --> 28:12.564
- You heard in the yard?
- Yeah.

28:13.525 --> 28:16.610
Dean, does it bother you at all
how easily you seem to fit in here?

28:16.778 --> 28:18.654
- No, not really.
- All right, well, listen.

28:18.822 --> 28:21.532
Either way, we need more info on Glockner.
If she's buried.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.033
If so, where?

28:23.952 --> 28:26.120
And we got five hours to get it.

28:26.788 --> 28:29.707
Don't give me that
we-gotta-see-this-thing-through look.

28:29.874 --> 28:31.834
We are leaving tonight, no matter what.

28:32.001 --> 28:34.420
I just don't wanna let Deacon down.
We owe him.

28:34.587 --> 28:36.338
But we don't owe him our lives, Dean.

28:39.676 --> 28:43.137
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna go talk with our lawyer.

28:46.141 --> 28:47.307
You want me to what?

28:47.475 --> 28:50.644
Her name was Glockner, okay?
She worked here as a nurse in the '70s.

28:50.812 --> 28:54.940
Now, I need you to find out everything
about her, most importantly how she died.

28:55.108 --> 28:56.900
- And where she's buried.
- Are you nuts?

28:57.819 --> 29:00.195
You have any idea
the kind of the trouble you're in?

29:00.363 --> 29:01.488
I have a vague notion.

29:01.656 --> 29:04.575
Good, so let's forget about some
random nurse and talk about your case.

29:05.160 --> 29:08.036
- Mara. It's Mara, right?
- Yeah.

29:08.204 --> 29:10.831
I get that you're trying to help me, okay?
I do.

29:10.999 --> 29:14.334
But believe me when I say
that this is the best way that you can help.

29:14.502 --> 29:17.129
Really, how? Explain that to me.

29:17.297 --> 29:21.175
I wish I could, but I can't. I'm just gonna
have to ask you to trust me on this.

29:21.342 --> 29:23.051
Why should I?

29:23.678 --> 29:27.681
- Henricksen says you're a monster.
- I'm a monster?

29:30.685 --> 29:34.938
Well, he's wrong, okay?
I'm not what they say I am.

29:35.523 --> 29:38.692
- Everybody says that.
- Yeah.

29:39.194 --> 29:42.738
If you're as smart a PD as I think,
then you can tell with just one look...

29:42.906 --> 29:45.949
...whether or not your clients are guilty,
okay? Just like that.

29:46.117 --> 29:49.036
So I want you to look at me. Really look.

29:49.204 --> 29:51.038
And you tell me, am I guilty?

29:54.042 --> 29:55.626
We're not the bad guys.

30:05.178 --> 30:07.221
- She go for it?
- No. No, not so much.

30:07.388 --> 30:10.557
- Maybe she'll still come around.
- We can't wait around to find out.

30:10.725 --> 30:14.394
- We could give it another day.
- No, we're leaving tonight, and that's it.

30:14.562 --> 30:16.438
Not gonna finish?
We're gonna let people die?

30:16.606 --> 30:18.732
Don't give me that.
This was your stupid plan.

30:18.900 --> 30:21.026
I went along,
but we're sticking to the plan.

30:22.195 --> 30:24.655
Okay, you leave, I'm gonna stay.

30:25.198 --> 30:27.699
- Hey, don't turn away from me.
- Screw you.

30:27.867 --> 30:28.867
What? Screw you.

30:29.869 --> 30:31.286
Hey, hey.

30:31.454 --> 30:34.248
All right, hard case.
I see the usual methods ain't gonna work.

30:36.209 --> 30:37.209
You too, sweetheart.

30:38.962 --> 30:40.420
Come on.

30:51.099 --> 30:52.641
Take off.

30:53.434 --> 30:55.644
I wanna handle this alone.

31:12.620 --> 31:15.080
Deacon, you are beating the holy hell
out of me, man.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.791
Sorry, Dean.

31:17.959 --> 31:19.293
I thought I was going easy on you.

31:22.797 --> 31:24.548
Just trying to make it look real.

31:24.716 --> 31:27.134
Yeah, well, mission accomplished.

31:27.302 --> 31:29.803
So is it over?

31:29.971 --> 31:32.431
- No. It turns out it wasn't Moody.
- What?

31:32.599 --> 31:34.558
- Yeah.
- Then who?

31:35.018 --> 31:36.685
It's some nurse
who used to work here.

31:36.853 --> 31:38.103
But we're shy on all the intel.

31:38.271 --> 31:39.897
Which is why
we should stick around.

31:40.064 --> 31:41.982
Oh, hey, guys.
- You wanna fight for real?

31:42.150 --> 31:43.817
- We gotta go now.
Guys.

31:43.985 --> 31:47.362
We're leaving. Otherwise we'll be leaving
for Milwaukee with Henricksen.

31:47.530 --> 31:48.780
- Oh, come on.
- Guys.

31:48.948 --> 31:50.616
What?

31:52.911 --> 31:54.453
Your lawyer left this for you.

31:57.332 --> 32:00.500
Would you look at that?
Man, I am frigging velvety smooth.

32:01.002 --> 32:04.004
You wanna open it after you're done
patting yourself on the back?

32:04.172 --> 32:05.964
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:08.176 --> 32:09.509
- Wow.
- What?

32:09.677 --> 32:11.678
Well, you wanna share
with the class, Dean?

32:11.846 --> 32:14.348
Glockner died in the old cellblock
after Moody bit it.

32:14.515 --> 32:17.893
It seems they had a little inmate uprising,
she got caught in the middle.

32:18.061 --> 32:21.897
They dragged her to a solitary cell,
gave her severe cerebral edema.

32:22.065 --> 32:24.524
- Someone bashed her head in.
- Yeah.

32:24.692 --> 32:26.485
- Say where she's buried?
- Yep.

32:27.195 --> 32:29.071
Then let's get you the hell out of here.

32:30.865 --> 32:32.741
Don't worry, we'll get rid of this thing.

32:36.371 --> 32:39.164
Good, because I want it
out of my prison.

32:40.166 --> 32:42.501
Boys, uh...

32:43.586 --> 32:45.754
...I can't thank you enough for this.

32:45.922 --> 32:48.882
I know it was asking a lot,
but you still came through.

32:49.342 --> 32:51.093
Your daddy raised you right.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.805
Well, we owed you.

32:58.601 --> 33:01.895
I hope to see you again, huh?
Just not in here, okay?

33:02.063 --> 33:04.648
- Yeah. We'll do our best.
Right. Yeah.

33:06.651 --> 33:08.235
Oh.

33:08.945 --> 33:11.154
- Where do you want it?
- What?

33:14.575 --> 33:16.576
Yeah, um...

33:16.911 --> 33:18.412
Uh...

33:18.913 --> 33:20.414
Make it look real, son.

33:33.720 --> 33:37.097
Oh, man, are you a sight for sore eyes.

33:42.979 --> 33:45.731
You know, I almost wish
I could see Henricksen's face.

33:45.898 --> 33:48.108
Really? I'd be happy
if I never saw him again.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.903
- We're not really out of the woods yet.
- Yeah.

33:56.117 --> 33:57.701
Good point.

34:04.125 --> 34:06.793
I told you, one of them
came up behind me.

34:06.961 --> 34:09.129
- You let them get the drop on you?
- Yeah.

34:09.297 --> 34:10.464
I screwed up, all right?

34:10.630 --> 34:13.800
- What do you want me to say?
- I wanna know where they're headed.

34:13.967 --> 34:16.803
- How the hell would I know?
- Let's start over again.

34:17.472 --> 34:18.764
For God's sake.

34:18.931 --> 34:22.516
Again. I wanna know everything they did
today from the minute they woke up.

34:26.272 --> 34:27.272
Got up.

34:27.857 --> 34:31.650
Breakfast. Visiting hours. Rec time.

34:33.362 --> 34:36.822
- Any visitors?
- Just their lawyer.

34:44.540 --> 34:47.667
It's an easy question.
What did you and Dean talk about?

34:47.835 --> 34:49.168
I have already told you...

34:49.337 --> 34:52.380
...it was a private conversation
between me and my client.

34:52.547 --> 34:55.509
Right. And just three hours later,
he just happened to bust out.

34:57.470 --> 34:59.805
Now, tell me what he said.

35:16.697 --> 35:19.366
We gotta move it.
If Henricksen gets to the lawyer...

35:19.534 --> 35:22.953
I thought she couldn't say anything.
That lawyer-client privilege thing.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.205
The privilege doesn't apply, Dean.

35:25.373 --> 35:28.375
- So she'll talk?
- She has to.

35:28.543 --> 35:30.335
Oh, that's frigging super.

35:30.503 --> 35:31.878
Let me make this simple.

35:32.046 --> 35:34.714
You don't come clean,
I will put you on the hook for abetting.

35:34.882 --> 35:36.007
That's ridiculous.

35:36.175 --> 35:38.593
Don't think that I can?
You think this is some game?

35:38.761 --> 35:41.596
I am the last person on planet Earth
you wanna screw with.

35:42.807 --> 35:46.893
Now, tell me what he said.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.775
He wanted me to do some research.

35:55.736 --> 35:58.280
On a prison nurse that died in 1976.

35:58.865 --> 36:00.574
What? Why?

36:00.741 --> 36:02.784
- I don't know.
- What else?

36:05.121 --> 36:07.080
They wanted to know
where she was buried.

36:07.248 --> 36:08.707
Did you find out where?

36:10.376 --> 36:12.752
- Yeah.
- Did you tell them?

36:15.715 --> 36:17.090
Yeah.

36:24.891 --> 36:26.474
Tell me.

37:11.729 --> 37:12.812
Got her.

37:46.722 --> 37:47.931
Aah!

38:05.032 --> 38:07.367
You let those two go.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.789
You sure this is the right cemetery?

38:55.249 --> 38:57.334
She said Mountainside.
Mountainside Cemetery.

39:32.119 --> 39:35.789
- You thought we were screwed before.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.

39:35.956 --> 39:37.665
We gotta go deep this time.

39:37.833 --> 39:39.793
Deep, Dean?

39:40.503 --> 39:41.669
We should go to Yemen.

39:41.837 --> 39:45.048
Oh, I'm not sure
I'm ready to go that deep.
