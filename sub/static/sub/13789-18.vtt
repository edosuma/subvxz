WEBVTT

00:05.506 --> 00:07.468
So I was on my way
to meet Bennett for dinner,

00:07.468 --> 00:09.090
and there's this squirrel
in the street,

00:09.090 --> 00:11.132
just running free,
so I yell, "Squirrel,"

00:11.132 --> 00:13.554
and swerve 'cause I don't want
the poor fella to be road kill.

00:13.554 --> 00:16.097
Don't worry,
he scampered off just fine.

00:16.097 --> 00:20.351
But to answer your question,
no, there's no one
named Stu here.

00:20.351 --> 00:23.484
All right, now I've recorded
everything Ellen just said.

00:23.484 --> 00:24.815
You ready to see how
we turn this into

00:24.815 --> 00:26.737
a really cool prank
using my soundboard app?

00:26.737 --> 00:30.281
- I don't understand Da-da.
- I'm hungry.

00:30.281 --> 00:31.452
Perfect. Let's do it.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.035
Bennett, dinner
is almost ready.

00:35.035 --> 00:38.038
Okay, honey.
What are we having?

00:38.038 --> 00:39.540
Road kill stew.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.752
[Stan laughs]

00:41.752 --> 00:45.876
That's just a funny
sorta name for it, right?

00:45.876 --> 00:48.129
I mean, we're not having
actual road kill.

00:48.129 --> 00:49.260
Squirrel!

00:51.472 --> 00:54.555
Squirrel?
Are you kidding me?

00:54.555 --> 00:55.846
No!

00:57.808 --> 01:01.272
You mean, you're actually
cooking squirrel for dinner?

01:01.272 --> 01:03.354
I found a free
squirrel in the street.

01:03.354 --> 01:05.686
Poor fella.
Dinner.

01:05.686 --> 01:07.318
[laughing]

01:07.318 --> 01:09.360
Is this because
I asked you

01:09.360 --> 01:11.362
to spend less money
on shoes?

01:15.576 --> 01:17.368
So I got dinner.

01:17.368 --> 01:20.371
No, no, no.
We are not eating that.

01:21.832 --> 01:24.545
But it's locally grown
and organic.

01:24.545 --> 01:28.008
Okay, you win.
Buy all the shoes you want.

01:28.008 --> 01:30.131
Yes! Wait, what?

01:30.131 --> 01:32.012
Never mind. I don't care.
I'm gonna buy shoes.

01:32.012 --> 01:33.764
You said buy shoes,
I'll buy shoes.

01:33.764 --> 01:35.386
[laughing]
Yeah!

01:35.386 --> 01:37.678
He thought he was
gonna eat squirrel.

01:37.678 --> 01:38.769
You guys like that prank?

01:38.769 --> 01:40.771
So can we eat
the squirrel?

01:40.771 --> 01:43.144
No, you guys don't
understand pranks.

01:43.144 --> 01:44.565
There is no squirrel.

01:44.565 --> 01:46.437
I wanted squirrel.

01:46.437 --> 01:48.779
Why can't we
have squirrel?

01:48.779 --> 01:51.402
Are you mad at us?

01:51.402 --> 01:53.534
[crying]
What did we do wrong?

01:53.534 --> 01:57.198
[puppies crying]

01:57.198 --> 02:00.040
Okay, okay.
I'll get you a squirrel.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.502
Yay!

02:01.502 --> 02:02.953
What's a squirrel?

02:04.665 --> 02:06.957
There is no end to the fun
I'm gonna be able to have

02:06.957 --> 02:08.959
with my soundboard.

02:08.959 --> 02:11.252
I can't wait to mess around
with some of the things

02:11.252 --> 02:12.553
I caught Robert saying.

02:14.255 --> 02:16.517
Robert, you deleted it?

02:18.679 --> 02:21.472
Always one step ahead.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.373
Knockity-knockity.

02:42.373 --> 02:46.086
You don't knock and say,
"Knockity-knockity."

02:46.086 --> 02:48.419
[scoffs]
Amateurs.

02:48.419 --> 02:51.592
Look, Karl, one of your drones
crashed in our yard.

02:51.592 --> 02:55.636
- You can't prove it's mine.
- It says Air Fink One
on the side.

02:55.636 --> 02:59.220
I am glad you're here,
because I am bursting with news.

02:59.220 --> 03:01.262
I have a girlfriend.

03:01.262 --> 03:03.934
What the what?
You have a girlfriend?

03:03.934 --> 03:04.935
Who is she?
What's her name?

03:04.935 --> 03:07.308
Her name is... made up.

03:07.308 --> 03:08.899
I made her up
so you think I'm cool,

03:08.899 --> 03:10.901
but I'm not,
so carry on with your day.

03:10.901 --> 03:13.234
When you say
"made her up,"

03:13.234 --> 03:16.026
you don't mean built her
out of robot parts, do you?

03:16.026 --> 03:18.819
Because after
the last one attacked
a mall, I thought you quit.

03:18.819 --> 03:21.031
Well, there really
is no reason

03:21.031 --> 03:23.824
for me not to tell you,
is there?

03:23.824 --> 03:25.326
So yes, I should?

03:25.326 --> 03:28.459
But I won't.
There's no such person.

03:28.459 --> 03:30.501
Yeah, I have trouble
imagining

03:30.501 --> 03:32.463
how odd someone
would have to be

03:32.463 --> 03:34.595
to be your
actual girlfriend.

03:34.595 --> 03:36.837
I wouldn't say odd just because
she dresses in black.

03:36.837 --> 03:40.681
And is quiet.
Very quiet.

03:40.681 --> 03:42.052
A librarian.

03:42.052 --> 03:44.014
An angry, angry librarian.

03:44.014 --> 03:46.146
Yes, you don't want to
return your books late to her.

03:46.146 --> 03:47.848
That's the gal for me.

03:47.848 --> 03:49.940
Actually, now that
I think about it,

03:49.940 --> 03:52.443
maybe I do know a girl
who's right for you.

03:52.443 --> 03:54.565
Oh, really? Who is
this enchanting creature?

03:54.565 --> 03:56.907
You already have
a girlfriend.

03:56.907 --> 03:58.569
Max? What are you
doing in Karl's...

03:58.569 --> 04:01.452
Oh, my what the what?!

04:01.452 --> 04:03.574
Okay, fine.

04:03.574 --> 04:06.627
You know.
Karl's my boyfriend.

04:06.627 --> 04:10.250
And apparently,
it's only a secret
when I'm talking.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.333
I'm sorry.

04:12.333 --> 04:14.585
I thought it was best
if we kept it a secret
for now.

04:14.585 --> 04:16.877
You know how things
are when you're in
a group of friends

04:16.877 --> 04:18.969
and two of them
start dating.

04:18.969 --> 04:20.721
Don't worry, we can
still be friends

04:20.721 --> 04:22.513
even if you guys
are dating.

04:22.513 --> 04:24.765
I'm actually glad that
you two got together.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.557
I was worried that neither
one of you would find happiness

04:26.557 --> 04:28.349
and you'd both end up
becoming super-villains

04:28.349 --> 04:29.560
and we couldn't hang out.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.101
Super-villains? Huh.

04:31.101 --> 04:32.773
I am pretty disappointed
in humanity.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.736
And I too have
a pretty good idea
for a Doomsday machine.

04:35.736 --> 04:36.987
[both] Power couple!

04:41.402 --> 04:43.534
Good. You're all here.

04:43.534 --> 04:45.706
I have something very special
for one of you.

04:45.706 --> 04:47.708
- A new car?
- Premium channels?

04:47.708 --> 04:49.540
Hugs for my favorite daddy.

04:49.540 --> 04:51.332
That's how you get
a pony.

04:51.332 --> 04:55.215
So far, Chloe's winning.

04:55.215 --> 04:58.339
I have one extra ticket
to a huge,

04:58.339 --> 05:01.802
once-in-a-lifetime event
at the museum this week--

05:01.802 --> 05:03.594
Oh, just take Avery.

05:03.594 --> 05:05.596
You two always end up at
the educational things together.

05:05.596 --> 05:08.058
I already asked. She's busy,
she has a school thing.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.771
Can't attend something
educational because of school.

05:10.771 --> 05:12.813
Is that ironic?
No, really, is it?

05:12.813 --> 05:15.065
I've never been quite clear
on what irony is,

05:15.065 --> 05:18.068
which is ironic, maybe.
I don't know.

05:18.068 --> 05:21.702
So you graduated
early, huh?

05:21.702 --> 05:24.785
What this means is that
one of you can now go with me.

05:24.785 --> 05:27.077
- Why not take Mom?
- What? Take Chloe.

05:27.077 --> 05:30.040
I can't go.
Who'll watch my pony?

05:30.040 --> 05:34.164
Look, I only ask for
two things in life:

05:34.164 --> 05:37.418
one, no questions while
I watch Upton Carriage House--

05:37.418 --> 05:39.800
- Those English accents--
- And two,

05:39.800 --> 05:42.222
someone to go to
the museum with me.

05:42.222 --> 05:43.674
You guys figure out
which one is going,

05:43.674 --> 05:45.676
and tell me later.

05:45.676 --> 05:47.388
We certainly will.

05:47.388 --> 05:49.309
- We got it.
- [Chloe] Take Tyler.

05:51.392 --> 05:53.273
[phone rings]

05:53.273 --> 05:56.437
- Hello.
- Tyler, it's Tyler,
from the future.

05:58.028 --> 06:00.691
Oh, yeah, well,
if you're me,

06:00.691 --> 06:02.573
then what's
my Buddy Bop password?

06:02.573 --> 06:04.154
1-2-3-4-5-?

06:04.154 --> 06:05.906
Whoa, the only people
who know that

06:05.906 --> 06:08.869
are me and my dog who
asked me that this morning.

06:08.869 --> 06:12.663
[chuckling]

06:12.663 --> 06:15.756
So what's my life like
in the future?

06:15.756 --> 06:17.257
- Okay.
- Yes!

06:19.379 --> 06:21.882
Now do you understand
how pranks are funny?

06:21.882 --> 06:23.964
I saw a butterfly
in the window.

06:23.964 --> 06:27.848
My feet smell like
corn chips.

06:27.848 --> 06:30.511
Well, we're
getting closer.

06:34.645 --> 06:36.106
So, Lindsay,
there's something

06:36.106 --> 06:37.898
I was dying to tell you,

06:37.898 --> 06:39.690
but Karl and Max wanted
to tell you themselves.

06:39.690 --> 06:42.653
Lindsay, I have
a girlfriend.

06:42.653 --> 06:43.864
And I have a boyfriend.

06:43.864 --> 06:45.285
That's a coincidence.

06:47.367 --> 06:51.371
- Actually, I like Karl.
- And I like Max.

06:51.371 --> 06:53.874
What about
your boyfriend?
And your girlfriend?

06:53.874 --> 06:57.087
So many people
are being hurt.

06:57.087 --> 06:58.919
Lindsay, I don't think
you're quite following.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.921
I'm not just following,
I'm one step ahead of you.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.252
The only way to make
this work is if

07:02.252 --> 07:04.004
your girlfriend
and your boyfriend get together.

07:04.004 --> 07:06.597
I think we can
pull this off.
Hands in.

07:07.758 --> 07:09.850
Max is dating Karl.

07:09.850 --> 07:11.011
They're dating each other
exclusively.

07:11.011 --> 07:13.854
There's no other
boyfriend or girlfriend.

07:13.854 --> 07:14.975
Oh!

07:14.975 --> 07:17.017
Eww!

07:17.017 --> 07:19.940
Uh... aww!

07:19.940 --> 07:22.362
I went through
those stages, too.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.325
But when two friends
in a group date,

07:25.325 --> 07:26.446
doesn't that
make things weird?

07:26.446 --> 07:28.829
[both] It's not weird.

07:28.829 --> 07:30.070
[gasping, laughing]

07:30.070 --> 07:33.203
Here's hoping that never
happens again.

07:34.575 --> 07:36.166
All right,
TV night.

07:36.166 --> 07:37.788
Two minutes until
Liars Cove.

07:37.788 --> 07:39.920
I can't wait to find out
if Claudia tells Asher

07:39.920 --> 07:41.081
she's falling in love
with Raif.

07:41.081 --> 07:43.924
The barista with a past.

07:43.924 --> 07:47.347
Karl and I decided
we don't wanna watch
Liars Cove tonight.

07:47.347 --> 07:49.179
We always watch
Liars Cove.

07:49.179 --> 07:50.801
New tradition.

07:50.801 --> 07:52.432
Max wants to watch
The Shuffling Doomed,

07:52.432 --> 07:54.805
so come on, let's watch
The Shuffling Doomed.

07:54.805 --> 07:58.018
I can't wait to see
who's doomed and
who's shuffling.

07:58.018 --> 08:00.310
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:00.310 --> 08:02.442
You can't just say,
"New tradition,

08:02.442 --> 08:05.025
Max wants to
dut-dut-doy."

08:05.025 --> 08:08.609
You are paraphrasing me.
I want that noted.

08:08.609 --> 08:10.200
My point is, Karl,

08:10.200 --> 08:11.411
you should think
for yourself.

08:11.411 --> 08:13.493
I always think
for myself,

08:13.493 --> 08:15.415
and I want to watch...
say Shuffling Doomed.

08:15.415 --> 08:17.788
Just Shuffling Doomed.

08:20.170 --> 08:21.792
All right, we are ready
for game night.

08:21.792 --> 08:23.043
And we brought the games.

08:23.043 --> 08:24.835
Thank you so much.

08:24.835 --> 08:26.386
I know we usually
do this at Lindsay's,

08:26.386 --> 08:28.799
but Max and I were
so looking forward to hosting.

08:28.799 --> 08:30.891
The hostess gifts
you brought can go here.

08:32.302 --> 08:35.515
No? Okay.
No worries.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.848
We'll hold up
our end.

08:38.849 --> 08:40.771
Tonight we're
going to play

08:40.771 --> 08:42.272
the new Realm of the Tower
video game

08:42.272 --> 08:43.984
in honor of the upcoming
convention in the park

08:43.984 --> 08:45.275
We can't wait.

08:45.275 --> 08:47.988
But we always play
one of these games.

08:47.988 --> 08:51.031
I mean, Lindsay
gets confused,
Max gets annoyed,

08:51.031 --> 08:52.823
Karl accuses me of
loading the dice.

08:52.823 --> 08:55.365
Come on, tradition.

08:55.365 --> 08:57.788
Wait, who gets confused?

08:59.499 --> 09:01.161
- Take that.
- And that.

09:01.161 --> 09:03.253
- And that.
- Finish it off.

09:03.253 --> 09:05.966
[both growling]

09:05.966 --> 09:08.468
That was delightful.

09:09.930 --> 09:11.842
Yeah. I think I
gotta get going.

09:11.842 --> 09:13.844
So what do you all
wanna do tomorrow?

09:13.844 --> 09:15.435
You know what?

09:15.435 --> 09:17.437
The rest of you guys
have fun.

09:17.437 --> 09:19.309
- I just wanna be alone.
- Yeah, me, too.

09:19.309 --> 09:20.480
- Wanna go to my house?
- Totally.

09:24.314 --> 09:26.566
Well, I'm still reeling
from no hostess gifts.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.898
Who raised them?

09:30.951 --> 09:32.743
Hey, Max,
where's Karl?

09:32.743 --> 09:34.494
Oh, that.

09:34.494 --> 09:36.156
Yeah, we broke up.

09:42.542 --> 09:46.126
Max, why did you and Karl
break up?

09:46.126 --> 09:48.298
When you guys
walked out last night,

09:48.298 --> 09:50.550
it was so obvious
that our relationship

09:50.550 --> 09:51.972
was ruining the dynamics
of the group.

09:51.972 --> 09:54.214
I told Karl we couldn't
let that happen,

09:54.214 --> 09:56.556
and the two of us
started to fight about it.

09:56.556 --> 09:58.268
He said
some things to me,

09:58.268 --> 09:59.890
I said
some things to him,

09:59.890 --> 10:02.062
I gave him back
his vial of vampire blood,

10:02.062 --> 10:05.565
which was pretty clearly
just hot sauce in a bud vase.

10:06.687 --> 10:09.650
And, well, it's over.

10:09.650 --> 10:10.941
Are you okay, Max?

10:10.941 --> 10:14.074
No, I'm not okay.
He broke my heart.

10:17.197 --> 10:19.619
I know you gave that to me
for my birthday, Avery,

10:19.619 --> 10:22.913
but any heart that's
not shattered mocks me.

10:22.913 --> 10:25.876
Tia, run. Don't ask why.

10:28.298 --> 10:30.090
Run all you want, Tia.

10:30.090 --> 10:32.552
We have fifth period
together.

10:32.552 --> 10:34.925
Max, it was one fight.

10:34.925 --> 10:37.637
If you feel that strongly,
maybe you guys can fix it.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.430
If he came back to me and
apologized, I'd listen to him,

10:40.430 --> 10:43.063
but there is no way I'm
going crawling back to him.

10:45.065 --> 10:46.897
I feel terrible.

10:46.897 --> 10:49.860
Max was worried that
dating Karl would
mess up the group,

10:49.860 --> 10:51.531
and when we walked
out on them,

10:51.531 --> 10:52.943
we proved her right.

10:52.943 --> 10:54.654
We're the reason
they broke up.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.196
I'm gonna go
talk to Karl.

10:56.196 --> 10:58.658
Oh, no, Avery,
I just remembered.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.120
There's a blood drive
on campus,

11:00.120 --> 11:01.872
and everyone's getting
heart stickers.

11:01.872 --> 11:03.914
Cancel the drive,
cancel the drive!

11:07.627 --> 11:12.132
Chloe, I'm worried that
you and your daddy aren't
spending enough time together.

11:12.132 --> 11:15.926
Brainstorm! Maybe that
museum thing would be fun
for you two, huh?

11:15.926 --> 11:18.008
This isn't
mani-pedi time.

11:18.008 --> 11:20.600
It's a trap.
Run for it, Chloe.

11:20.600 --> 11:22.763
Chloe.

11:22.763 --> 11:24.394
As your mother,

11:24.394 --> 11:27.107
I order you to go
to the museum with
your father.

11:27.107 --> 11:30.190
I think if this were
a thing you could order me to
do,

11:30.190 --> 11:32.112
you would've
done that first.

11:32.112 --> 11:34.484
Dang it.

11:34.484 --> 11:36.366
Just for that,

11:36.366 --> 11:38.618
you have to brush
your teeth extra well tonight.

11:38.618 --> 11:40.410
- I do that anyway.
- Dang it!

11:42.162 --> 11:43.283
Hey, Chloe.

11:43.283 --> 11:46.286
It's too bad you're
not going to the museum.

11:46.286 --> 11:48.708
Bet there'll be
a lot of pretty girls there.

11:48.708 --> 11:49.960
Pretty girls love art.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.631
Smart pretty girls.

11:51.631 --> 11:53.383
I've been down that road.

11:53.383 --> 11:56.136
It's all fun and games
till one of us has to talk.

11:56.136 --> 11:59.339
Tyler, I'm sure you have
plenty to say

11:59.339 --> 12:03.433
to a smart...
ah, forget it.

12:03.433 --> 12:05.185
You know what we should do
is come up with a plan

12:05.185 --> 12:07.057
to trick Mom into going.

12:07.057 --> 12:08.809
We can tell there'll be
a bunch of celebrities there.

12:08.809 --> 12:11.231
She does love celebrities.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.653
I've seen her run up to
seven different women yelling

12:13.653 --> 12:15.695
"Amy Adams, I love you!"

12:15.695 --> 12:18.068
Amy Adams?!

12:18.068 --> 12:20.120
Oh.

12:20.120 --> 12:22.572
So it's too bad you're
not going to the museum.

12:22.572 --> 12:24.995
There's a lot of
celebrities there.

12:24.995 --> 12:27.077
Yeah, smart celebrities.

12:27.077 --> 12:29.169
It's all fun and games until
they start yammerin' on

12:29.169 --> 12:30.670
about melting icebergs.

12:30.670 --> 12:33.253
[both] Dang it!

12:36.216 --> 12:38.178
Karl, listen.

12:39.429 --> 12:41.431
Karl, listen.

12:41.431 --> 12:44.014
Max is really upset
about the break-up.

12:44.014 --> 12:46.186
She's upset, is she?

12:46.186 --> 12:48.979
Is she carrying
a candelabra in her hands?

12:50.190 --> 12:52.562
Is she composing
a toccata of misery

12:52.562 --> 12:54.104
for pipe organ
in D Minor?

12:54.104 --> 12:57.657
[funereal organ music plays]

12:59.199 --> 13:02.782
Is she wearing
a gloomy cape?

13:02.782 --> 13:05.115
Oh, be a lamb and hand me
that gloomy cape behind you.

13:12.122 --> 13:14.124
Well, if you're
as upset as she is,

13:14.124 --> 13:16.506
you guys could
get together again.

13:16.506 --> 13:18.338
If you just go to her
and apologize,

13:18.338 --> 13:20.720
- she'll forgive you.
- Me, apologize?

13:20.720 --> 13:23.183
Why doesn't she
come apologize to me?

13:23.183 --> 13:25.265
Finks do not apologize.

13:25.265 --> 13:27.767
We grovel, we surrender,
we flip-flop,

13:27.767 --> 13:30.770
but we do it
sans apology.

13:30.770 --> 13:34.234
You are just as stubborn
as Max is.

13:34.234 --> 13:36.236
Well, if I'm too stubborn
to apologize,

13:36.236 --> 13:38.068
and she's too stubborn
to apologize,

13:38.068 --> 13:40.070
then our relationship
is doomed.

13:40.070 --> 13:42.282
Anyone who isn't
a complete dolt could see that.

13:42.282 --> 13:44.074
You'll explain it
to Lindsay.

13:44.074 --> 13:45.245
As soon as I see her.

13:48.748 --> 13:50.540
[phone chimes]

13:52.712 --> 13:55.255
[Avery] Sorry, Dad, still can't
make it to the geology exhibit

13:55.255 --> 13:56.716
at the museum.

13:56.716 --> 13:58.418
I know the rocks are
gonna be awesome,

13:58.418 --> 13:59.880
but no rock show for me.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.301
[Bennett] But, Avery--

14:01.301 --> 14:03.133
Before you say
"But, Avery,"

14:03.133 --> 14:05.926
I repeat:
I can't go.

14:07.097 --> 14:08.728
- How did she know...
- [phone chimes]

14:08.728 --> 14:10.560
I know you, Dad.

14:12.682 --> 14:14.814
Okay, family meeting.

14:16.816 --> 14:18.318
Listen, I wanted
to tell you guys--

14:18.318 --> 14:20.190
- I can't make it.
- I've got a thing that day.

14:20.190 --> 14:23.323
My doctor says
it might kill me.

14:23.323 --> 14:25.745
You people.

14:25.745 --> 14:28.158
Fine. No one has to
go with me to the museum.

14:28.158 --> 14:29.199
[all sighing with relief]

14:29.199 --> 14:30.951
I just thought
you might enjoy

14:30.951 --> 14:34.254
the greatest rock show
Pasadena will ever see.

14:34.254 --> 14:35.916
Rock show?

14:35.916 --> 14:38.298
Did you say rock show?
I like rock shows.

14:38.298 --> 14:40.340
Not just any
rock show.

14:40.340 --> 14:42.382
The rock show
of the decade.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.965
The stones will be
so close, you can touch them.

14:44.965 --> 14:46.556
The Stones?

14:46.556 --> 14:48.178
The Stones?!

14:48.178 --> 14:51.351
[gasping]

14:51.351 --> 14:53.313
This is perfect.

14:53.313 --> 14:55.475
The Rolling Stones
are Mom's favorite rock band.

14:55.475 --> 14:57.187
Now she'll wanna go
and we're off the hook.

14:57.187 --> 14:59.319
The Stones
will be there?

14:59.319 --> 15:00.610
And so close,
I can touch them?

15:00.610 --> 15:04.234
I tried that once
and they threw me out.

15:04.234 --> 15:06.446
Why are the Stones
gonna be at the museum?

15:06.446 --> 15:09.329
Probably 'cause
they're fossils.

15:09.329 --> 15:12.242
Tyler, there's gonna be
something there for everyone.

15:12.242 --> 15:14.204
Let me say two words:

15:14.204 --> 15:16.166
Volcanic rock.

15:16.166 --> 15:18.038
Volcanic rock?

15:18.038 --> 15:19.419
That sounds awesome.

15:19.419 --> 15:22.252
♪ Volcanic rock! ♪

15:22.252 --> 15:25.465
Suddenly, this sounds
exciting.

15:25.465 --> 15:27.968
This is great.
I'll get tickets for everyone.

15:27.968 --> 15:30.390
Are you sure? It seems like
it's gonna be a really
tough ticket.

15:30.390 --> 15:32.432
I know the guy
who stores the stones

15:32.432 --> 15:34.224
in their velvet-lined
cases between shows.

15:34.224 --> 15:37.357
I am just hearing
about this now?

15:40.400 --> 15:43.323
[ Avery's voice]
Stan is bad.
He's very, very bad.

15:43.323 --> 15:45.445
Okay, yes, I drank
from the toilet

15:45.445 --> 15:46.866
before I licked you.

15:46.866 --> 15:50.160
I did it once;
we were having a fight.

15:50.160 --> 15:52.622
Stan is hummingbird.
Short pants, carrot weasel.

15:52.622 --> 15:55.165
Wait a minute.

15:56.626 --> 15:58.838
We pranked you, Da-da.

15:58.838 --> 16:02.882
You're a short pants
carrot weasel.

16:02.882 --> 16:04.634
You did it!

16:04.634 --> 16:06.886
You pranked
your old man.

16:06.886 --> 16:10.720
Oh, boy. Here come
the tears of pride.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.472
Wait a minute.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.475
Who are you calling
a short pants carrot weasel?

16:16.726 --> 16:18.308
[girls laughing]

16:18.308 --> 16:20.230
Oops. Better put this away.

16:20.230 --> 16:23.603
[Tyler] Hey, good-lookin'.
Thanks for the smile.

16:23.603 --> 16:26.196
Oh, my gosh.
Your brother just
called me good-looking.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.952
It's just a recording
of Tyler talking to himself

16:32.952 --> 16:35.285
in the mirror.
It's a soundboard app.

16:35.285 --> 16:38.458
Well, that's a little
less flattering.

16:38.458 --> 16:39.959
Wait a minute.

16:39.959 --> 16:42.712
This could be how
we can help Karl and Max.

16:42.712 --> 16:45.255
They're both too stubborn
to apologize to each other.

16:45.255 --> 16:47.257
What if we make them think
the other's apologized

16:47.257 --> 16:48.838
using the soundboard app
while they're both at

16:48.838 --> 16:50.470
the Realm of the Tower
convention?

16:50.470 --> 16:52.722
I think we can
pull this off.
Hands in.

16:54.934 --> 16:57.687
Avery, why is your dog
hands-inning with us?

17:07.527 --> 17:09.609
- Do you see them?
- Yeah, there's Max.

17:11.321 --> 17:12.412
[Avery] And there's Karl.

17:12.412 --> 17:13.953
So does your
soundboard guy

17:13.953 --> 17:15.455
have the recordings
of Max and Karl programmed in?

17:15.455 --> 17:18.037
Yes, and he has cut them
together seamlessly.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.579
Max, this is...

17:19.579 --> 17:22.622
[forcefully] Karl Fink!

17:22.622 --> 17:24.294
So who's your
sound guy?

17:26.876 --> 17:28.928
I am the dark of
the dying

17:28.928 --> 17:31.591
that envelops the dreams
of the forgotten.

17:31.591 --> 17:33.383
Nah, no, I'm just kidding.

17:33.383 --> 17:36.676
I'm a regular
soundboard guy.

17:36.676 --> 17:38.518
Ooh, he sounds complicated.

17:38.518 --> 17:40.560
Is he single?

17:40.560 --> 17:42.942
Nope. Married.
Couple of kids.

17:42.942 --> 17:44.354
He doesn't make
a lot of money,

17:44.354 --> 17:47.317
so occasionally,
I throw him a bone.

17:47.317 --> 17:49.399
That is funny for reasons
I cannot tell you.

17:49.399 --> 17:51.151
Let's go.

17:53.613 --> 17:54.784

18:00.580 --> 18:02.752
Hello. I'm Max.

18:02.752 --> 18:06.416
Max, you have
wounded me deeply.

18:06.416 --> 18:08.087
It will take someone
with a poet's soul

and a silver tongue
to win me back.

You make a good case.

Okay, fine.
What do you want, Karl Fink?

18:33.573 --> 18:35.615
Stupid soundboard app.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.407
It was working fine
before.

18:37.407 --> 18:40.410
Why did I upgrade?

18:40.410 --> 18:42.832
Unless you're here
to apologize,

18:42.832 --> 18:44.204
I have nothing
to say to you.

18:44.204 --> 18:46.166
Perfect.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.007
I'm here to apologize.

to give me an apology.

18:50.420 --> 18:54.384
I wanted to give you
an apology.

18:54.384 --> 18:57.096
Karl Fink!

18:57.096 --> 18:58.678
Thank you, Karl.

18:58.678 --> 19:01.020
Your saying that
means a lot to me.

19:01.020 --> 19:02.602
Your saying that
means a lot to me.

19:02.602 --> 19:04.894
Whoopsie.

19:04.894 --> 19:06.646
Are you making
fun of me?

19:06.646 --> 19:09.439
No, no. Apology.

19:09.439 --> 19:11.321
Apology, apology.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.734
Why are you just standing
there staring at me?

19:14.734 --> 19:16.486
Are you waiting
for me to kiss you?

19:16.486 --> 19:19.829
Fine, fine. Fine.

19:19.829 --> 19:21.741
Okay, then,
here I come.

19:23.543 --> 19:25.164
You're sending me
mixed signals.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.086
I've heard romance
can be confusing.

19:27.086 --> 19:29.419
How do so many
stupid people do it?

19:32.292 --> 19:33.843
So you've been
standing there

19:33.843 --> 19:35.295
awfully quiet
for a while.

19:35.295 --> 19:37.056
You don't want
a kiss, do you?

19:37.056 --> 19:39.098
Stupid people do it.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.061
So that's a yes then?

19:43.893 --> 19:45.895
It's gonna be easy
to catch you.

19:45.895 --> 19:48.608
You're kinda running
like Lindsay.

19:48.608 --> 19:52.482
She does run like the zombies
on Shuffling Doomed.

19:54.073 --> 19:55.485
So we're back
together?

19:55.485 --> 19:57.447
Yes, because
one of us had the courage

19:57.447 --> 20:00.079
to accept an apology
when it was offered.

20:00.079 --> 20:01.241
[both] You're welcome.

20:01.241 --> 20:03.323
I don't know
what just happened,

20:03.323 --> 20:05.245
but I believe a kiss
was in the air a moment ago.

20:06.496 --> 20:09.419
Oh, look.
Our plan worked.

20:09.419 --> 20:11.501
They're gonna kiss.

20:11.501 --> 20:14.294
[both] Oh! Ew!

20:14.294 --> 20:17.257
Uh. Aww!

20:18.508 --> 20:20.840
But why are they kissing
with the heads on?

20:23.433 --> 20:26.225
Trust me.
It's better this way.

20:28.308 --> 20:30.310
Sir, that's my hat.

20:30.310 --> 20:31.941
Sir, that's my hat!

20:40.990 --> 20:43.283
You left me
locked in the tower.

20:44.744 --> 20:47.126
A good thing I have
this Rapunzel wig.

20:51.040 --> 20:53.633
Now I just need to wait
for my prince.

20:57.297 --> 21:01.220
I thought we were gonna
ee the Stones at a rock show.

21:01.220 --> 21:05.515
Not the stones
at a rock show.

21:05.515 --> 21:07.727
"Igneous is bliss"?

21:07.727 --> 21:09.439
I don't even know
what this means,

21:09.439 --> 21:10.810
but I know it's not funny.

21:12.312 --> 21:13.943
I can't believe

21:13.943 --> 21:17.487
you let me go to a museum
dressed like this.

21:20.490 --> 21:23.202
I told you you could buy
a sweatshirt at the gift shop.

21:23.202 --> 21:24.784
Why would I do that?

21:24.784 --> 21:27.577
Amy Adams gave me
the thumbs up.

21:27.577 --> 21:30.079
That wasn't Amy...

21:30.079 --> 21:31.501
Ugh, forget it.
