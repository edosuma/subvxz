00:43.847 --> 00:46.759
It's been a long road

00:48.007 --> 00:50.202
Gettin' from there to here

00:51.047 --> 00:53.641
It's been a long time

00:54.767 --> 00:57.998
But my time is finally near

00:58.567 --> 01:01.798
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:02.887 --> 01:05.924
I will touch the sky

01:06.167 --> 01:09.762
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

01:09.927 --> 01:12.839
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:12.967 --> 01:16.926
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

01:17.567 --> 01:20.365
I'm going where my heart will take me

01:20.567 --> 01:24.606
I've got faith to believe

01:25.167 --> 01:27.806
I can do anything

01:27.927 --> 01:31.602
I've got strength of the soul

01:32.447 --> 01:35.200
And no one's gonna bend or break me

01:35.367 --> 01:39.485
I can reach any star

01:40.967 --> 01:42.958
I've got faith

01:44.647 --> 01:47.525
I've got faith

01:48.407 --> 01:51.558
Faith of the heart

02:08.000 --> 02:12.882
Twice! Twice he's been captured.
And twice he's escaped.

02:14.567 --> 02:16.922
Our magistrate
should never have shown him mercy.

02:17.047 --> 02:19.003
He should have been executed
for his crimes.

02:19.127 --> 02:21.561
You had a simple mission, Duras.

02:21.687 --> 02:24.155
Locate the rebels
that Archer was harbouring...

02:24.287 --> 02:27.996
and return them to the Empire.
But you failed.

02:28.127 --> 02:30.163
Archer made a fool of you.

02:30.607 --> 02:33.519
We are offering you
a chance to regain your command...

02:33.647 --> 02:35.160
and your honour.

02:36.447 --> 02:38.039
I will not fail.

02:44.127 --> 02:46.880
- It must be something pretty serious.
- What's going on?

02:47.007 --> 02:49.885
- The Captain wants to talk to us.
- About what?

02:50.007 --> 02:54.285
He's speaking to Admiral Forrest.
It's the third time in the last hour.

02:55.887 --> 02:57.240
Something's obviously up.

02:57.367 --> 03:01.326
I can't remember the last time he asked
me to join the senior staff for a briefing.

03:01.447 --> 03:03.836
Maybe it has something to do with the...

03:11.447 --> 03:13.722
There's been an attack on Earth.

03:15.087 --> 03:17.043
What do you mean attack?

03:18.127 --> 03:21.324
A probe.
They don't know where it came from.

03:22.767 --> 03:24.962
It fired a weapon that cut a swath...

03:26.287 --> 03:28.084
4,000 kilometres long.

03:30.367 --> 03:32.358
From Florida to Venezuela.

03:34.407 --> 03:36.637
There may have been
a million casualties.

03:36.767 --> 03:38.041
A million?

03:39.807 --> 03:43.356
- We've been recalled.
- Did they say why?

03:44.687 --> 03:46.120
I didn't ask.

03:47.647 --> 03:49.763
It'll take a while to get back, sir.

03:50.287 --> 03:52.243
Bridge to Captain Archer.

03:56.287 --> 03:59.040
- Go ahead.
- It's Admiral Forrest, sir.

03:59.567 --> 04:00.886
Understood.

04:02.807 --> 04:05.082
Set a course, Travis. Warp 5.

04:13.967 --> 04:15.161
Come in.

04:19.846 --> 04:22.202
- Excuse me, Captain.
- Trip.

04:23.847 --> 04:28.762
When you spoke to Admiral Forrest,
did he say what part of Florida was hit?

04:30.207 --> 04:31.799
No, I'm sorry.

04:34.287 --> 04:36.801
She may have been away.

04:36.927 --> 04:39.202
Architects take a lot of trips.

04:42.087 --> 04:43.725
Older or younger?

04:44.327 --> 04:45.806
My baby sister.

04:48.767 --> 04:50.564
When we were in school...

04:51.247 --> 04:54.478
I made sure all the boys in her class
got a good look at me.

04:55.567 --> 05:00.197
- None of them ever messed with her.
- Maybe she was away.

05:04.167 --> 05:07.045
Anything you can tell me
about what the Admiral said?

05:07.287 --> 05:10.040
The number of casualties
has been revised.

05:11.607 --> 05:13.563
It's up to three million.

05:14.367 --> 05:16.403
Why would someone do this?

05:18.687 --> 05:19.881
Come in.

05:24.887 --> 05:27.606
- I spoke with Ambassador Soval.
- And?

05:27.727 --> 05:30.799
A Vulcan transport
located the pod in Central Asia.

05:30.927 --> 05:33.919
They retrieved it and brought it
to Starfleet Headquarters.

05:34.047 --> 05:35.685
- What do they know?
- Very little.

05:35.807 --> 05:37.877
There was a pilot, killed on impact.

05:38.007 --> 05:41.556
- Who the hell was he? What species?
- They don't know.

05:41.967 --> 05:45.118
Did they say anything
about what part of Florida was hit?

05:45.247 --> 05:46.202
No.

05:48.887 --> 05:51.082
Trip's sister lives in Florida.

05:57.207 --> 05:58.162
Archer.

05:58.287 --> 06:00.847
Captain, we've got Suliban ships,
eight of them.

06:00.967 --> 06:02.923
Approaching at high warp.

06:03.047 --> 06:05.402
Just what we need. Tactical Alert.

06:10.807 --> 06:12.081
Hail them.

06:14.087 --> 06:16.521
- They're not responding.
- Try again.

06:26.647 --> 06:28.000
The Captain.

06:35.607 --> 06:37.677
There's someone
who needs to speak with you.

06:37.807 --> 06:40.162
Silik! I knew you'd have
something to do with this.

06:40.287 --> 06:42.243
- Do with what?
- Millions of people.

06:42.367 --> 06:43.925
You killed millions of people.

06:44.047 --> 06:46.766
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

06:46.887 --> 06:49.117
That wouldn't be wise, Captain.

06:51.087 --> 06:52.679
What the hell am I doing here?

06:52.807 --> 06:54.957
There's someone
who needs to speak with you.

06:55.087 --> 06:57.237
He has information
you should find helpful.

06:57.367 --> 07:00.916
- Don't worry, you won't be harmed.
- Information about what?

07:01.047 --> 07:04.642
Something to do with your species.
It's in great danger.

07:12.727 --> 07:15.719
He can see you more clearly
if you move closer.

07:17.367 --> 07:19.835
- Who is he?
- He wants to talk to you.

07:19.967 --> 07:22.356
It would be foolish to ignore him.

07:29.447 --> 07:32.678
- What do you want?
- Your planet was attacked.

07:32.807 --> 07:33.922
I'm aware of that.

07:34.047 --> 07:38.802
What you're not aware of is why.
The probe was sent by the Xindi.

07:39.287 --> 07:44.042
They learned that their world would be
destroyed by humans in 400 years.

07:45.007 --> 07:47.567
How would they know
what's going to happen in 400 years?

07:47.687 --> 07:50.076
They were told
by people from the future.

07:50.207 --> 07:53.324
People who can communicate
through time.

07:53.447 --> 07:55.563
Are they the ones
the Suliban are working for?

07:55.687 --> 07:57.917
The Suliban work for me.

07:58.047 --> 08:01.437
So you're the one who tried to start
a civil war in the Klingon Empire.

08:01.567 --> 08:04.286
The one who's manipulated my mission
from day one.

08:04.407 --> 08:08.605
The people who've contacted
the Xindi belong to another faction.

08:08.727 --> 08:10.683
The probe was only a test.

08:10.807 --> 08:14.322
The Xindi are building
a far more powerful weapon.

08:14.447 --> 08:18.156
When it is completed,
they will use it to destroy Earth.

08:19.567 --> 08:22.445
Annihilate us
before we can annihilate them.

08:24.807 --> 08:26.126
Why are you telling me this?

08:26.247 --> 08:29.603
The Xindi were not supposed to learn
about their future.

08:29.727 --> 08:33.686
If they deploy this weapon,
it will contaminate the timeline.

08:34.447 --> 08:36.914
You must not let that happen.

08:39.647 --> 08:44.118
- Why should I believe you?
- You have no choice but to believe me.

08:50.727 --> 08:54.276
If this time traveller is trying
to protect humanity...

08:54.407 --> 08:57.240
why didn't he tell you all this
before millions were killed?

08:57.367 --> 08:59.437
He didn't think we'd believe him.

09:00.127 --> 09:01.845
He's probably right.

09:04.247 --> 09:06.556
I'm sure Starfleet
and the High Command will find...

09:06.687 --> 09:09.155
a far more logical explanation
of who attacked Earth.

09:09.287 --> 09:11.039
He may be telling the truth.

09:11.167 --> 09:15.922
If he is, I need your support,
not your damn scepticism.

09:18.087 --> 09:21.523
Captain's Starlog, April 24th, 2153.

09:21.647 --> 09:23.922
The journey home
has been very difficult.

09:24.047 --> 09:26.880
We've now learned that
over seven million people were lost.

09:28.567 --> 09:29.761
Captain.

09:32.247 --> 09:33.726
That's our sun.

09:39.687 --> 09:42.360
- A vessel's dropping out of warp.
- Where?

09:42.487 --> 09:44.398
200 kilometres off port.

09:45.927 --> 09:47.326
Who are they?

09:48.007 --> 09:50.077
They've fired some kind of...

09:58.487 --> 10:00.443
That one took out
both forward phase-cannons.

10:00.567 --> 10:03.604
- You still have torpedoes.
- It's a Klingon bird-of-prey.

10:10.047 --> 10:11.275
They want you, sir.

10:11.407 --> 10:14.763
They're saying they won't destroy
Enterprise if you surrender to them.

10:15.647 --> 10:17.922
"Archer's an enemy of the Empire.

10:18.047 --> 10:21.437
"He must be brought to justice
if honour is to be regained."

10:21.567 --> 10:22.682
Duras.

10:25.927 --> 10:29.158
- Both their nacelles are crippled.
- Weapons?

10:29.287 --> 10:31.926
- Their cannons are down.
- Cease firing.

10:32.927 --> 10:34.883
Prepare a boarding party.

10:35.647 --> 10:37.558
Three ships approaching.

10:44.727 --> 10:47.002
- Earth vessels.
- Return fire!

10:50.647 --> 10:52.365
Shields are failing.

10:54.567 --> 10:56.205
- Are they off-line?
- No, sir.

10:56.327 --> 10:57.919
Then keep firing!

11:00.447 --> 11:03.120
We've lost disruptor banks 3 and 4.

11:04.567 --> 11:08.242
Withdraw! Go to warp speed.

11:13.287 --> 11:16.404
It's Captain Ramirez, sir,
on the Intrepid.

11:16.527 --> 11:21.317
- What the hell was that all about?
- A Klingon named Duras.

11:23.207 --> 11:26.802
- He's not very fond of me.
- Welcome home, Captain.

11:26.927 --> 11:29.395
I wish it was
under better circumstances.

11:51.927 --> 11:56.318
I told Command every word you've said.
They're having a hard time buying it.

11:56.727 --> 11:59.195
Do they have a better idea
of who did this?

12:01.207 --> 12:05.485
And how about the Vulcans?
I suppose you think I'm hallucinating.

12:06.207 --> 12:08.038
Our Science Directorate
has determined...

12:08.167 --> 12:10.237
that time travel is impossible.

12:10.367 --> 12:12.722
Are you willing to risk a second attack?

12:13.767 --> 12:16.565
All I'm asking is to take Enterprise...

12:17.487 --> 12:19.284
and find these Xindi.

12:20.327 --> 12:22.761
What do we have to lose,
a single starship?

12:23.327 --> 12:26.558
Seems like a small price to pay
if there's one chance in a million...

12:26.687 --> 12:27.676
that he's right.

12:27.807 --> 12:30.002
Do you know where
these coordinates he gave you are?

12:30.127 --> 12:32.322
At Warp 5, about a three-month trip.

12:32.927 --> 12:35.157
They're inside the Delphic Expanse.

12:37.767 --> 12:39.166
What's that?

12:39.647 --> 12:42.844
A region of space
nearly 2,000 light-years across.

12:43.367 --> 12:46.916
Vulcan ships have entered it,
but only a few have returned.

12:47.647 --> 12:50.719
Sounds like you're talking
about the Bermuda Triangle.

12:51.687 --> 12:54.724
There have been reports
of fierce and dangerous species.

12:54.927 --> 12:56.519
Unexplained anomalies.

12:56.647 --> 12:59.639
In some regions,
even the laws of physics don't apply.

12:59.767 --> 13:03.282
20 years ago, a Klingon vessel emerged
from the Expanse.

13:03.567 --> 13:06.957
Every crewman onboard
had been anatomically inverted.

13:07.367 --> 13:11.519
Their bodies splayed open
and they were still alive.

13:12.647 --> 13:16.276
You'd be more than foolish
to pursue this course of action.

13:25.527 --> 13:27.757
It's a risk I'm willing to take.

13:27.927 --> 13:30.521
And I imagine most of my crew
would be with me.

13:30.647 --> 13:33.002
This is typical of your impulsiveness.

13:33.127 --> 13:35.641
You'd be putting your crew's lives
at stake...

13:35.767 --> 13:38.759
when you have no evidence
that anything you were told is true.

13:38.887 --> 13:41.321
We've lost a lot of people already, Jon.

13:42.487 --> 13:45.684
Starfleet Command
would need some kind of proof...

13:46.287 --> 13:47.959
before they'd let you go.

13:48.207 --> 13:52.962
I'm not sure the person I spoke to
was from the future or not.

13:54.087 --> 13:57.682
But he knew that this would be
the reaction that I'd get.

13:59.047 --> 14:00.162
So...

14:01.927 --> 14:03.679
he did give me proof.

14:17.207 --> 14:18.276
Jon?

14:19.407 --> 14:21.841
This is quantum dating the debris.

14:24.287 --> 14:25.640
Take a look.

14:26.447 --> 14:31.077
The principal alloy in this piece was
synthesized within the last four years.

14:32.887 --> 14:35.117
This one, about a year earlier.

14:35.247 --> 14:38.319
What exactly are you trying
to show us, Captain?

14:40.727 --> 14:42.445
12 years for this piece.

14:42.567 --> 14:45.206
- Your point, Jonathan?
- I'm getting to it.

15:00.927 --> 15:02.918
You might find this interesting.

15:07.327 --> 15:10.478
- Your scanner's not working properly.
- Why is that, sir?

15:11.567 --> 15:15.355
- The quantum date reads minus 420.
- What's wrong with that?

15:16.087 --> 15:19.363
Quantum dating always registers
in positive numbers.

15:22.167 --> 15:24.635
Then I guess
this one's not working, either.

15:28.127 --> 15:29.560
You said he told you...

15:29.687 --> 15:33.043
this faction from the future
could only communicate through time.

15:33.167 --> 15:36.204
So how do you suggest
they got this component to the Xindi?

15:36.327 --> 15:38.682
I haven't the slightest idea.

15:38.807 --> 15:42.197
But that doesn't change
what's on these scanners.

15:42.327 --> 15:44.921
This fragment's from the future.

15:45.047 --> 15:47.515
Unless you have another explanation.

15:48.327 --> 15:52.081
A lack of another explanation
doesn't make your assumption correct.

15:53.487 --> 15:55.398
I'll speak with Command.

15:59.527 --> 16:01.597
I'd like to take a look in there.

16:20.847 --> 16:23.281
Are you suggesting this is a Xindi?

16:24.527 --> 16:26.916
I sure as hell would like to find out.

16:36.287 --> 16:37.959
This is Dr. Fer'at.

16:40.007 --> 16:41.679
I don't have a lot of time. What's up?

16:41.807 --> 16:44.765
The Vulcan research team
detected traces of pyretic radiation...

16:44.887 --> 16:46.286
in the alien debris.

16:46.407 --> 16:47.726
Why didn't Starfleet catch it?

16:47.847 --> 16:50.202
Some of our technology
is more advanced than yours.

16:50.327 --> 16:52.716
We need to treat anyone
who got close to the wreckage.

16:52.847 --> 16:55.600
Dr. Fer'at is here to determine
the extent of your exposure.

16:55.727 --> 16:58.560
It shouldn't take long.
Please, have a seat.

17:03.327 --> 17:05.921
Have you experienced
any nausea or dizziness?

17:06.047 --> 17:08.321
- No.
- Numbness in your extremities?

17:08.446 --> 17:09.880
I feel fine.

17:10.007 --> 17:13.636
I was told that you think a piece
of the wreckage came from the future.

17:13.767 --> 17:16.964
I know,
Vulcans don't believe in time travel.

17:17.287 --> 17:18.720
Some of us do.

17:19.686 --> 17:23.964
Tell me, this time traveller you met,
was he humanoid?

17:25.207 --> 17:28.517
- How do you know about that?
- I was briefed before coming here.

17:28.647 --> 17:31.036
He seemed humanoid,
but I couldn't see him that well.

17:31.167 --> 17:33.317
Have you encountered
people from the future before?

17:33.447 --> 17:34.436
A number of times.

17:34.567 --> 17:36.876
Does this have
anything to do with the radiation?

17:37.007 --> 17:38.679
I was just curious.

17:41.047 --> 17:43.800
It must be very difficult
to have so many people...

17:43.927 --> 17:45.519
question your story.

17:45.647 --> 17:48.115
- Does it upset you?
- Doesn't help.

17:48.247 --> 17:51.876
- But how does it make you feel?
- I told you, it doesn't help.

17:52.007 --> 17:54.680
I can sense some anger
when you talk about this.

17:56.087 --> 18:00.126
It's kind of strange that a Vulcan
would be so interested in my feelings.

18:00.247 --> 18:01.646
Just curious.

18:03.327 --> 18:06.797
Your exposure seems minimal.
You'll require very little treatment.

18:06.927 --> 18:08.997
I imagine you must have felt
very anxious...

18:09.127 --> 18:11.163
after meeting someone from the future.

18:11.287 --> 18:14.962
- Why would you imagine that?
- I'm afraid this examination is over.

18:15.087 --> 18:17.203
- I'm nearly finished.
- You are finished.

18:17.327 --> 18:20.285
I just checked the Vulcan database.
There's only one Dr. Fer'at.

18:20.407 --> 18:23.524
And he's not a pathologist,
he's a psychiatric analyst.

18:24.247 --> 18:26.203
Soval sure is persistent.

18:26.647 --> 18:29.286
What did he want you to do?
Prove that I'm out of my mind?

18:29.407 --> 18:31.363
You come to my sickbay
under false pretences.

18:31.487 --> 18:34.399
- Where are your medical ethics?
- I'm doing what I was told to.

18:34.527 --> 18:37.678
Well, I'm telling you
to get the hell off my ship.

18:38.167 --> 18:40.158
If you wouldn't mind, Phlox...

18:40.287 --> 18:43.040
I'd like you to escort our guest
to the airlock.

18:43.927 --> 18:45.042
Gladly.

18:52.807 --> 18:54.160
I'm so sorry.

18:57.887 --> 18:59.798
The house was over there.

19:00.687 --> 19:02.439
Less than a kilometre.

19:06.767 --> 19:09.759
See over there?
That was the old movie theatre.

19:10.647 --> 19:12.239
When we were kids...

19:12.367 --> 19:15.803
if I didn't take my sister with me,
she'd scream like a banshee.

19:18.647 --> 19:21.719
Are you certain she was here
when this happened?

19:23.487 --> 19:26.604
Someone would have heard from her
if she wasn't.

19:35.847 --> 19:39.317
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.
After days of debate...

19:39.447 --> 19:41.085
Starfleet's finally informed me...

19:41.207 --> 19:43.675
that we're to proceed
with our new mission.

19:44.967 --> 19:48.801
- The NX-02.
- She'll be ready to launch in 14 months.

19:50.647 --> 19:52.524
A long time.

19:52.647 --> 19:54.717
Hopefully, you'll be back
well before then.

19:54.847 --> 19:56.121
Hopefully.

19:57.367 --> 19:59.323
What kind of armaments will she have?

19:59.447 --> 20:03.918
The same complement of weapons
that you'll have once the retrofit is done.

20:04.727 --> 20:07.525
- Have you told your crew?
- This morning.

20:09.247 --> 20:12.876
- How many are staying aboard?
- Some haven't decided yet...

20:13.727 --> 20:17.322
but I don't think
more than eight or nine will be leaving.

20:17.767 --> 20:20.406
I talked to General Casey a few hours
ago.

20:20.527 --> 20:23.360
His team should be arriving
at 1800 hours.

20:24.767 --> 20:27.201
I was surprised you asked for them.

20:28.007 --> 20:31.443
You think you'll be comfortable
with military on board?

20:31.567 --> 20:34.604
I don't have a problem
with non-Starfleet personnel.

20:34.727 --> 20:37.719
The General tells me
these are the best he has.

20:38.887 --> 20:42.675
I'm gonna need all the muscle I can get
when we cross into the Expanse.

20:42.807 --> 20:46.686
You weren't told where in this Expanse
you were supposed to look.

20:46.807 --> 20:50.720
- Not even a hint.
- This weapon they're building...

20:51.527 --> 20:53.438
did he say how long it would take them?

20:53.567 --> 20:57.719
I don't think he would have warned us
if we didn't have a chance to stop them.

21:02.247 --> 21:03.680
Subcommander.

21:05.327 --> 21:07.761
Is there something I can do for you?

21:09.407 --> 21:12.240
Are you confident with your decision,
Doctor?

21:12.927 --> 21:16.397
- What decision would that be?
- To remain on Enterprise.

21:17.047 --> 21:21.120
Crewman Fuller just told me a shuttle's
on its way with 200 snow beetles.

21:21.527 --> 21:23.279
They could be for my replacement.

21:23.407 --> 21:27.366
There isn't a doctor in Starfleet
that would know what to do with them.

21:29.687 --> 21:31.484
And what about you?

21:33.687 --> 21:35.325
The High Command has made it clear...

21:35.447 --> 21:38.086
that they don't want me
to enter the Delphic Expanse.

21:38.207 --> 21:40.482
I'm more interested
in hearing what you want.

21:40.607 --> 21:43.167
It's not my place
to disobey the High Command.

21:43.727 --> 21:47.197
Nonsense. You've done it before.

21:50.487 --> 21:53.081
It's interesting, you and I...

21:53.207 --> 21:55.767
the only aliens on board this vessel.

21:56.567 --> 21:58.797
To go or to stay.

22:00.007 --> 22:03.522
For me, it was a simple question
of loyalty toward the Captain.

22:04.207 --> 22:07.324
And the sad realization
that he'll need me more than ever...

22:07.447 --> 22:12.157
on such a crucial mission.
But for you, it's a more difficult decision.

22:12.727 --> 22:15.844
Does your allegiance lie
with the High Command...

22:15.967 --> 22:17.844
or with Captain Archer?

22:20.327 --> 22:22.318
This just arrived, Doctor.

22:28.207 --> 22:29.799
Thank you, Doctor.

22:36.967 --> 22:38.639
Photonic torpedoes.

22:39.687 --> 22:43.805
Their range is over 50 times greater
than our conventional torpedoes...

22:43.927 --> 22:45.724
and they have a variable yield.

22:45.847 --> 22:49.635
They can knock the com array off
a Shuttlepod without scratching the hull.

22:49.767 --> 22:52.645
Or they can put a three-kilometre crater
into an asteroid.

22:52.767 --> 22:54.917
How long's it gonna take
to reconfigure the tubes?

22:55.047 --> 22:56.446
Three teams are working on it.

22:56.567 --> 22:58.956
They promised it'll be done
before we leave Spacedock.

22:59.087 --> 23:01.521
I've got to start integrating them
into the power grid.

23:01.647 --> 23:02.875
Let's go.

23:04.687 --> 23:07.645
Is there going to be
some kind of service?

23:08.207 --> 23:09.526
For Lizzie?

23:10.447 --> 23:14.122
If you're talking about a funeral,
it's pointless when there's nothing left.

23:14.247 --> 23:18.479
- I guess I was talking about a memorial.
- My sister wasn't big on memorials.

23:19.727 --> 23:23.925
I read there was a day of remembrance
for the victims a couple of months ago.

23:24.047 --> 23:25.162
I'm sorry you missed it.

23:25.287 --> 23:28.006
Why are you so obsessed
with memorials?

23:28.127 --> 23:31.119
- I'm not obsessed.
- She's dead.

23:31.247 --> 23:33.681
So are seven million others.

23:33.807 --> 23:36.401
She was no more important
than any of them.

23:36.527 --> 23:38.643
She was more important to you.

23:38.767 --> 23:41.122
There's nothing wrong
with admitting that.

23:41.247 --> 23:44.284
I'm getting real tired of you telling me
what I can and can't do.

23:44.407 --> 23:47.604
And I don't need you to remind me
that Elizabeth was killed.

23:47.727 --> 23:49.797
So just let it alone.

23:51.047 --> 23:54.005
Maybe you should pay more attention
to upgrading your weapons.

23:54.127 --> 23:57.597
So you can blow the hell out
of these bastards when we find them.

24:03.087 --> 24:06.841
With all due respect, Admiral,
what is the point in me watching this?

24:06.967 --> 24:09.003
Is it to frighten me,
make me change my mind...

24:09.127 --> 24:10.526
about commanding this mission?

24:10.647 --> 24:14.242
It's important for you
to see what you'll be facing.

24:15.447 --> 24:17.597
The Vaankara was
in the Delphic Expanse...

24:17.727 --> 24:21.117
for less than two days
when we received a distress call.

24:21.927 --> 24:24.725
This transmission
arrived six hours later.

24:58.127 --> 25:01.563
Less than an hour later,
the Vaankara was destroyed.

25:02.487 --> 25:05.877
There was no indication
of a malfunction or an attack.

25:08.487 --> 25:11.206
Are you suggesting
the crew was responsible?

25:11.327 --> 25:14.125
I'm suggesting
you reconsider this mission.

25:17.167 --> 25:19.283
Is there anything else, sir?

25:24.607 --> 25:26.882
I need to speak with you, T'Pol.

25:33.567 --> 25:36.764
If all goes well, you'll be able to return
to your duties on Earth...

25:36.887 --> 25:40.516
within a year.
That is, if you're still interested.

25:41.847 --> 25:44.361
You haven't been back to Vulcan
for some time.

25:45.127 --> 25:49.405
You may find your assignment
at the Ministry of Information refreshing.

25:50.567 --> 25:53.604
I don't understand
why I can't stay in San Francisco.

25:54.207 --> 25:56.562
You've spent far too much time
with humans.

25:56.687 --> 25:59.360
It would be best
if you return home for a while.

26:00.687 --> 26:03.247
You thought it crucial
to place a Vulcan on Enterprise...

26:03.367 --> 26:06.006
during its first mission. Why not now?

26:07.167 --> 26:10.477
You were there to provide logic
to a crew of humans...

26:10.607 --> 26:13.280
who insisted on leaving
before they were ready.

26:13.407 --> 26:16.319
But logic can't help them
inside the Delphic Expanse.

26:16.447 --> 26:20.281
- Can you be certain of that?
- The High Command was quite specific.

26:20.407 --> 26:22.443
You're to return to Vulcan.

26:23.487 --> 26:26.240
I believe that should be my decision.

26:26.367 --> 26:28.961
This is not a matter of choice.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.839
Defying the High Command
would mean...

26:30.967 --> 26:32.764
immediate dismissal. You know that.

26:35.047 --> 26:38.596
Soval agreed to let us take her back
to Vulcan, if it's all right with you.

26:38.727 --> 26:43.357
It's not that far out of your way.
How's that last refit team doing?

26:43.807 --> 26:46.002
Scheduled to be done by 0600.

26:51.007 --> 26:54.682
I could tell you there are a lot of people
counting on you.

26:58.007 --> 27:01.602
- But I don't need to do that, do I?
- No, sir.

27:04.407 --> 27:05.886
Good luck, Jon.

27:41.167 --> 27:43.522
- Have they gone to Warp?
- Not yet.

27:45.087 --> 27:46.600
Charge weapons...

27:47.847 --> 27:50.236
and prepare to bring them online.

27:59.447 --> 28:02.996
It's bad enough one of us
is up in the middle of the night.

28:03.127 --> 28:04.958
How's Porthos holding up?

28:05.127 --> 28:07.436
If no people have returned
from the Delphic Expanse...

28:07.567 --> 28:08.920
I doubt any dogs have.

28:09.047 --> 28:12.119
He must be doing better than we are.
He's fast asleep.

28:14.807 --> 28:17.401
- You picked a new science officer?
- No.

28:20.647 --> 28:23.081
You're gonna miss her, aren't you?

28:25.647 --> 28:29.162
When they first assigned her,
I felt like strangling Soval.

28:29.767 --> 28:31.917
She does kind of grow on you.

28:33.927 --> 28:37.397
I would think you'd be the first one
to show her to the airlock.

28:37.527 --> 28:38.596
No.

28:43.247 --> 28:44.805
To Henry Archer.

28:49.247 --> 28:51.363
I wonder what he'd think
if he knew his engine...

28:51.487 --> 28:53.523
was gonna help save the human race.

29:00.087 --> 29:01.918
When I got this job...

29:03.007 --> 29:06.079
commanding the first Warp 5 ship
was as big a responsibility...

29:06.207 --> 29:07.560
as I could have imagined.

29:09.367 --> 29:11.961
Then, we began running into so many...

29:13.287 --> 29:14.606
bad guys...

29:15.207 --> 29:18.643
and I had to start thinking
more about the safety of 83 people.

29:18.767 --> 29:22.043
And now the stakes
have gotten a lot bigger.

29:22.167 --> 29:24.203
Weight of the world, Trip.

29:24.327 --> 29:25.601
Literally.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.804
I can't wait to get in there, Captain.

29:31.927 --> 29:34.122
Find the people who did this.

29:35.247 --> 29:37.841
And tell me
we won't be tip-toeing around.

29:37.967 --> 29:41.880
None of that non-interference crap
T'Pol always shoves down our throats.

29:42.007 --> 29:46.239
- Maybe it's a good thing she's leaving.
- We'll do what we have to, Trip.

29:50.047 --> 29:51.719
Whatever it takes.

29:59.247 --> 30:00.441
It's Duras.

30:01.607 --> 30:04.246
- You wanted to test the new torpedoes.
- What yield?

30:04.367 --> 30:06.367
Start low.
We just want to get them off our backs.

30:06.367 --> 30:07.163
Start low.
We just want to get them off our backs.

30:11.527 --> 30:14.121
- What was that?
- Antimatter warheads.

30:14.247 --> 30:17.284
Increase shielding
and target their weapon ports.

30:19.207 --> 30:23.439
- They're still on our backs, sir.
- Bring the yield up, 50%.

30:30.567 --> 30:34.685
- I told you to target the weapon ports!
- Their hull plating's been enhanced.

30:37.367 --> 30:39.358
Our Warp drive is failing.

30:40.967 --> 30:44.277
- They're dropping to impulse.
- Stand down weapons, sir?

30:48.687 --> 30:51.884
How long will it take them
to repair their engines?

30:52.007 --> 30:55.363
- Impossible to determine.
- Give me an educated guess.

30:56.927 --> 30:58.838
Three hours, possibly more.

30:59.487 --> 31:02.047
- What's our speed?
- Warp 3, sir.

31:04.007 --> 31:05.326
Go to 4.5.

31:06.567 --> 31:09.957
If we can make it to Vulcan space
before they get their engines back...

31:10.087 --> 31:13.045
they'll think twice
about giving us any more trouble.

31:17.847 --> 31:19.041
Come in.

31:25.007 --> 31:28.158
Ensign Mayweather says
we're two days from Vulcan.

31:28.687 --> 31:30.484
Why don't you sit down?

31:32.247 --> 31:35.876
Just think, in two days,
you'll be eating real Vulcan food.

31:36.967 --> 31:40.676
Chef's done an adequate job
of approximating Vulcan cuisine.

31:42.527 --> 31:45.917
Well, you never did care
for the way we smell.

31:46.047 --> 31:48.481
At least you won't have
to put up with that anymore.

31:48.607 --> 31:50.404
I've gotten used to it.

31:51.247 --> 31:54.876
How about all those emotions
we bombard you with every day?

31:55.247 --> 31:58.557
I've grown accustomed to that, as well.
Somewhat.

32:05.127 --> 32:07.243
You're not making this easy.

32:09.807 --> 32:13.197
There's gotta be something
you're looking forward to back home.

32:21.687 --> 32:24.520
- I don't wish to return to Vulcan.
- What?

32:25.487 --> 32:29.196
I want to remain on board Enterprise,
if you'll allow me to.

32:30.327 --> 32:32.921
It's not a question of my allowing you.

32:34.847 --> 32:37.202
The High Command
would never agree to it.

32:38.167 --> 32:40.727
I've decided to resign my commission.

32:41.447 --> 32:42.516
Why?

32:44.127 --> 32:45.845
You've worked so hard, T'Pol.

32:45.967 --> 32:49.323
You're taking Enterprise
into a very dangerous place.

32:49.447 --> 32:51.563
This is no time for me to leave.

32:54.367 --> 32:57.484
- We'll be all right.
- You need a science officer.

32:58.287 --> 33:01.438
Whether she's a member
of the High Command or not.

33:02.247 --> 33:04.966
I've been thinking about who to promote.

33:07.127 --> 33:09.163
You need me, Captain.

33:26.407 --> 33:29.205
Keeping away from those Klingons...

33:29.327 --> 33:32.125
isn't going to be as easy as we thought.

33:32.247 --> 33:33.396
Sir?

33:35.087 --> 33:36.998
We're not going to Vulcan.

33:43.567 --> 33:45.046
Mr Mayweather.

33:46.647 --> 33:50.526
- Set a course for the Delphic Expanse.
- Aye, sir.

33:57.407 --> 33:59.284
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

33:59.407 --> 34:02.001
We've been travelling at Warp 5
for seven weeks.

34:02.127 --> 34:04.846
The crew is anxious
to begin our mission.

34:06.047 --> 34:09.119
- Distance?
- Nearly a million kilometres.

34:10.286 --> 34:12.641
Looks a hell of a lot closer than that.

34:13.367 --> 34:16.723
A common mistake,
when viewing something of this size.

34:18.286 --> 34:19.481
Magnify.

34:22.447 --> 34:23.926
Not very helpful.

34:24.047 --> 34:26.880
It's not that dense
all the way through, is it?

34:27.007 --> 34:28.326
The Vulcans said the Expanse...

34:28.447 --> 34:31.324
is surrounded by thick layers
of thermobaric clouds.

34:31.647 --> 34:34.366
When their last ship went in,
it took almost six hours...

34:34.487 --> 34:36.125
to get through it.

34:39.007 --> 34:41.726
Anything on long-range sensors?

34:41.847 --> 34:43.678
Nothing beyond the perimeter.

34:50.007 --> 34:51.725
0.2 impulse, Travis.

34:55.127 --> 34:56.560
Let's head in.

35:14.567 --> 35:16.956
- Anything?
- Nothing yet.

35:18.407 --> 35:21.046
We've been in here
for more than six hours.

35:21.167 --> 35:22.600
Let's be patient.

35:25.007 --> 35:26.804
We launched
the communications buoy, sir.

35:26.927 --> 35:29.839
We got a test signal through
to Starfleet.

35:29.967 --> 35:32.561
- Keep them apprised of our position.
- Aye, sir.

35:34.967 --> 35:36.400
Got something?

35:37.407 --> 35:39.716
- Yes.
- Probably the buoy.

35:40.567 --> 35:42.762
Not unless you launched three of them.

36:00.487 --> 36:04.958
- The targeting scanners won't lock on!
- Then get closer.

36:08.887 --> 36:10.923
You said Klingons wouldn't go
into the Expanse.

36:11.047 --> 36:14.039
We're not in the expanse yet.
Hold your course.

36:14.167 --> 36:16.397
- Go to full impulse.
- I wouldn't recommend that.

36:16.527 --> 36:18.757
The intake manifolds
are having a tough enough time.

36:18.887 --> 36:21.117
You heard me, Travis.

36:21.247 --> 36:23.283
They're keeping up with us, sir.

36:25.767 --> 36:28.042
- We're being hailed.
- Put it up.

36:29.767 --> 36:32.839
- Surrender, or be destroyed.
- Go to hell.

36:33.647 --> 36:38.084
You're outgunned, Archer.
Come about and prepare to be boarded.

36:38.207 --> 36:41.358
If you don't obey my orders, I'll...

36:44.767 --> 36:48.885
The perimeter cloud is dissipating.
I'm detecting clear space ahead.

36:49.687 --> 36:52.281
That's why Duras
wants us to come about.

36:52.407 --> 36:54.557
He's afraid of the Expanse.

36:54.687 --> 36:57.281
Increase speed, Travis.

36:58.007 --> 37:00.441
The other ships are going to turn back.

37:02.687 --> 37:03.881
Cowards.

37:07.207 --> 37:10.995
- We'll do it ourselves.
- We're too close to the Expanse.

37:23.967 --> 37:25.844
Only one left, sir.

37:27.247 --> 37:28.236
Keep firing.

37:28.367 --> 37:30.244
The Expanse
is less than five minutes away.

37:30.367 --> 37:33.837
- Maybe he'll turn around like his friends.
- I wouldn't bet on it.

37:35.647 --> 37:38.366
Your new torpedoes
aren't having the same effect as before.

37:38.487 --> 37:40.239
Duras transferred
his aft shields forward.

37:40.367 --> 37:42.483
Our weapons can't penetrate them.

37:46.887 --> 37:49.082
We just lost three antimatter injectors,
Captain.

37:49.207 --> 37:51.323
Any more and we're in big trouble.

37:51.447 --> 37:55.156
If he's transferred his shielding forward,
what's protecting his stern?

37:55.287 --> 37:58.199
- Does it matter? He's chasing us.
- What's protecting his stern?

37:58.327 --> 37:59.919
Minimal shielding.

38:01.087 --> 38:03.840
Think you can pull off
an L-Four at this speed?

38:03.967 --> 38:05.605
I can try, sir.

38:05.727 --> 38:08.560
Then look for the densest
cloud formation you can find.

38:08.687 --> 38:11.121
Captain Archer to all hands. Hold on.

38:16.007 --> 38:17.201
Captain.

38:19.727 --> 38:21.319
Looks good to me.

38:43.687 --> 38:45.166
Where are they?

38:52.527 --> 38:53.596
Fire.

39:07.527 --> 39:09.199
Nice going, Travis.

39:10.927 --> 39:14.078
I hope you don't ask me
to do that too often, sir.

39:15.567 --> 39:17.683
The Expanse is ahead, Captain.

39:23.047 --> 39:24.878
Did you lose any more
of those injectors?

39:25.007 --> 39:27.680
No, sir. We're good to go.

39:38.607 --> 39:40.962
Sure you still want to tag along?

39:41.887 --> 39:43.525
It's only logical.

39:55.287 --> 39:57.403
Straight and steady, Mr Mayweather.

39:59.567 --> 40:01.603
Let's see what's in there.
