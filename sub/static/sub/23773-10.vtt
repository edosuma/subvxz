FILM 10

01:08.440 --> 01:12.160
<i>At night, the trees ask each other</i>

01:12.920 --> 01:15.880
<i>how can they live without roots?</i>

01:23.520 --> 01:25.200
<i>Do you feel it?</i>

01:26.720 --> 01:27.920
<i>I love you.</i>

01:28.360 --> 01:32.200
Your father launched an investigation
into Major Meglin’s work on October 2.

01:32.800 --> 01:35.960
Call him by his name and rank.
We’re working here.

01:37.520 --> 01:38.520
Fine.

01:43.800 --> 01:47.440
I won’t bother you
with a full list of allegations

01:47.520 --> 01:52.440
made by Senior Adviser Steklov
against Major Meglin…

01:53.760 --> 01:55.880
but I can’t ignore one of them.

02:00.320 --> 02:04.960
Major Meglin
repeatedly and for no valid reason

02:05.040 --> 02:09.080
put Senior Lieutenant Steklova
at risk of psychological distress

02:09.160 --> 02:11.160
while training under his supervision.

02:11.880 --> 02:13.360
Any comments?

02:14.840 --> 02:16.440
Will you fetch me some more?

02:26.720 --> 02:31.840
SERPUKHOV

02:36.880 --> 02:37.960
Good afternoon.

02:38.960 --> 02:42.640
Investigator
Bukreinov Valentin Andreyevich.

02:42.720 --> 02:47.280
Assistant Investigator--
and my son-- Andrei.

02:47.360 --> 02:50.800
A brainy boy.
Solved two cases within a year.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.600
Impressive. No kidding?

02:53.480 --> 02:54.600
You bet.

02:54.680 --> 02:56.680
The murder of a traffic cop on a highway…

02:57.680 --> 03:02.000
and a case of illegal real estate brokers
killing an old woman downtown.

03:02.080 --> 03:03.040
Come on, Dad!

03:03.120 --> 03:05.880
An impressive track record.
Who killed whom?

03:06.560 --> 03:08.880
The traffic cop killed the old lady,
or the other way round?

03:08.960 --> 03:10.280
You feel like joking.

03:10.360 --> 03:13.520
But once he learned you were coming,

03:13.600 --> 03:17.800
he rushed here ahead of me… in my car.

03:18.520 --> 03:20.400
And I had to take a trolley.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.200
A family dynasty is good.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.600
He’ll always have a job.

03:32.080 --> 03:34.360
I knew Larissa for eight years. Why did she let him get so close?

03:36.800 --> 03:38.840
She was a smart investigator.

03:40.440 --> 03:44.240
Three weeks ago,
a case was handed over to her.

03:44.320 --> 03:46.040
A murder in a stairwell.

03:46.120 --> 03:51.120
A woman bought a bicycle
for her son on his birthday.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.320
She wanted it to be a surprise.

03:53.400 --> 03:57.040
She left it at the door and…
what a surprise.

03:57.640 --> 03:59.560
The boy opens the door.

04:00.520 --> 04:01.640
The mother’s not there.

04:01.720 --> 04:05.000
He goes to the elevator and sees her…
lying on the floor.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.720
He’s just nine years old.

04:08.240 --> 04:12.240
He’ll remember this birthday
for the rest of his life.

04:13.840 --> 04:15.360
Maybe it’s not that bad.

04:16.200 --> 04:18.160
In my entire life,

04:18.240 --> 04:20.920
I only remember one birthday--
when I turned 16.

04:24.040 --> 04:27.000
I got my passport.
That’s a day to remember.

04:28.280 --> 04:31.480
The same type of weapon.

04:32.240 --> 04:34.120
A shiv or awl.

04:34.200 --> 04:38.000
-Maybe just a coincidence?
-What kind of a coincidence?

04:38.080 --> 04:40.200
She discovered the murderer.
He knew it and killed her.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.080
-It’s a serial killing.
-A series is three murders or more.

04:43.720 --> 04:45.440
Don’t get too excited.
Wait until he kills once more.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.400
Why do women become investigators?

04:50.640 --> 04:52.240
It depends.

04:52.320 --> 04:55.320
Some follow in the steps of a relative,
like this dynasty.

04:55.400 --> 04:56.800
Some want to fight evil.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.880
Fighting evil is a good cause,

04:59.520 --> 05:00.960
but it pays poorly.

05:02.240 --> 05:03.040
What do you see?

05:04.080 --> 05:05.680
Why are the bags like that?

05:10.320 --> 05:11.640
Yes, why?

05:16.240 --> 05:17.400
Because…

05:21.520 --> 05:22.840
she wasn’t alone.

05:23.480 --> 05:25.360
She was with someone she knew.

05:25.440 --> 05:28.280
He helped her carry the bags.
He put them down.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.120
A blow-- she fell.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.280
May I?

05:36.160 --> 05:37.400
Blood.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.400
On her hands…

05:40.400 --> 05:41.640
and on the wall.

05:41.720 --> 05:44.920
Did she want to write something? A name.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.200
We talked to her neighbors.

05:47.720 --> 05:51.800
Nobody saw or heard anything,
except for an old lady from downstairs.

05:51.880 --> 05:53.080
Right there.

05:53.160 --> 05:55.600
She saw a man
running away from the entryway.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.280
A tall, big man.

05:57.360 --> 05:59.400
Why didn’t you tell me?

06:00.160 --> 06:02.640
-I didn’t have a chance.
-Or maybe he just didn’t want to.

06:03.400 --> 06:06.840
Dynasty, you’re letting down your father.
That’s not good.

06:07.440 --> 06:08.440
Go on.

06:09.400 --> 06:12.840
She saw him from the window.
She said he was tall.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.280
Around 50 years old.

06:14.360 --> 06:16.080
She only saw his back.

06:17.160 --> 06:20.240
-He didn’t seem familiar.
-Didn’t seem familiar?

06:20.320 --> 06:25.800
Yet my colleague claims
that Larissa knew the murderer.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.840
-How do you know that?
-How do you know that?

06:28.920 --> 06:31.880
Who would trust a stranger
to carry their bags these days?

06:32.560 --> 06:33.520
See?

06:34.400 --> 06:35.400
What’s this?

06:36.640 --> 06:38.760
It’s been sealed for seven years.

06:39.160 --> 06:40.960
The owner is in the nuthouse.

06:45.720 --> 06:46.440
I see.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.320
Shall we go inside? Excuse me, darling.

07:07.280 --> 07:08.880
Come on, Larissa…

07:10.040 --> 07:12.640
tell us how you lived your life.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.680
She burned the old one
and bought a new one.

07:24.760 --> 07:27.400
-How did it happen?
-She forgot to turn off the iron.

07:28.520 --> 07:31.360
You’ve never had
any female investigators in your life.

07:31.960 --> 07:33.720
-Any in yours?
-There were.

07:34.240 --> 07:35.560
They drifted away.

07:36.640 --> 07:38.560
She burned it because she drank.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.080
She was lonely, had no children.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.400
All the men she met were jerks.

07:44.480 --> 07:45.880
What was left for her?

07:45.960 --> 07:47.760
She didn’t like herself.

07:47.840 --> 07:50.240
She thought she was plain.
Hardly any pictures of her.

07:50.320 --> 07:52.520
-Maybe she was modest.
-Maybe.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.360
Did she smoke?

07:56.240 --> 07:57.240
I guess not.

08:01.160 --> 08:05.760
Why would a woman like Larissa
become an investigator?

08:06.240 --> 08:07.600
To find a man?

08:09.600 --> 08:10.600
Right.

08:11.480 --> 08:14.280
That’s exactly
what an investigator should do.

08:23.080 --> 08:25.560
Yurochkin Sergei Viktorovich. Sharipov Ruslan Yevgenyevich…

08:29.200 --> 08:30.920
Bukov Dmitry.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.360
Make a list of her recent phone calls,
okay?

08:35.720 --> 08:36.799
And check the numbers.

08:37.159 --> 08:38.159
Got it? See you.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.920
I made copies
of her investigation records.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.680
Excuse me. May I ask you something?

08:54.160 --> 08:56.400
What do you need
to become Meglin’s trainee?

08:56.480 --> 08:57.960
I’m a really good marksman

08:58.040 --> 09:00.360
and a swimmer and a runner.

09:01.400 --> 09:04.200
Father says he takes nobody on,
but he took you.

09:04.280 --> 09:05.680
I sleep with him.

09:11.080 --> 09:13.160
He asked what your method was.

09:13.240 --> 09:15.440
-What did you say?
-That you have no method.

09:15.520 --> 09:18.520
It’s booze at the agency’s expense
and then you finish off the killers.

09:19.680 --> 09:20.720
Well…

09:22.160 --> 09:23.360
as good a method as any.

09:37.880 --> 09:41.120
Over two days, she made about 20 calls
to the same number,

09:41.200 --> 09:43.080
and it’s not among the business cards.

09:43.640 --> 09:44.640
Text Glukhoi.

09:45.360 --> 09:47.120
Tell him to identify the owner.

09:48.640 --> 09:51.080
The beard wants you
to track down this number.

09:53.280 --> 09:54.480
Done.

09:58.680 --> 10:01.960
Roshchina had a theory
that the murderer was a lunatic.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.600
Because he made a doll?

10:06.600 --> 10:07.600
Yes.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.720
Did he bring thread with him?

10:14.480 --> 10:17.080
He uses the victims’ clothes
to make dolls.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.920
-She had a suspect.
-Who is it?

10:24.000 --> 10:26.120
A certain Komarov. After the first murder,

10:26.200 --> 10:29.080
she checked everyone in the district
who was registered with a nuthouse

10:29.160 --> 10:31.400
and had a criminal record.

10:31.480 --> 10:32.480
Original.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.000
Date of interrogation--

10:35.600 --> 10:37.280
yesterday, the day before her murder.

10:40.800 --> 10:41.840
Where does he live?

10:43.840 --> 10:47.480
Proviantskaya, Number 5.
The building across the street.

10:48.120 --> 10:49.560
Come on, let’s go back.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.160
Sure she asked me.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.640
A murder-- they come to me.
A rape-- again to me.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.720
Just because I killed somebody.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.920
They think anyone who killed once
will kill again.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.640
But I didn’t like it.

11:06.720 --> 11:09.400
I won’t kill again. I don’t want to.

11:09.480 --> 11:11.440
I make videos all the time.

11:11.520 --> 11:13.080
Just a moment.

11:13.160 --> 11:16.160
When I go shopping, I film myself.

11:16.800 --> 11:21.400
When I go to the drugstore or for a walk
or to bed…

11:23.440 --> 11:26.240
They always come after me. Here you are.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.200
Where was I?

11:29.000 --> 11:30.520
I have an alibi.

11:32.480 --> 11:35.080
I killed her by accident.

11:35.720 --> 11:38.520
She threw her child from the balcony
while I was taking a walk.

11:38.600 --> 11:42.360
He was lying in the snow. I brought him
to her, and she started screaming.

11:42.440 --> 11:45.480
I took a knife and killed Galya
to stop her screaming.

11:45.560 --> 11:48.160
I have everything recorded and indexed.

11:48.240 --> 11:49.600
She was my neighbor.

11:49.680 --> 11:52.640
<i>Where were you on Friday the 12th</i>
<i>at 5:00 in the afternoon?</i>

11:53.480 --> 11:55.080
<i>I was here at home.</i>

11:55.160 --> 11:57.320
<i>I have an alibi. I can show you.</i>

11:57.400 --> 11:59.480
-<i>Yes, please.</i>
-<i>But I only have one camera.</i>

11:59.560 --> 12:01.600
<i>If I put the tape in now…</i>

12:01.680 --> 12:04.280
When the president calls me in
for a secret meeting,

12:04.360 --> 12:09.440
I will propose a law that forbids throwing
children off balconies into the snow.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.840
They must put this in the constitution!

12:11.920 --> 12:13.320
Fast-forward the tape.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.400
Yes, just a moment.

12:16.560 --> 12:17.600
Stop.

12:17.680 --> 12:19.000
Play.

12:19.080 --> 12:21.240
<i>I’m working, but I’m about to-- What?</i>

12:22.640 --> 12:23.640
<i>Why?</i>

12:24.680 --> 12:26.360
<i>How are you not coming?</i>

12:26.960 --> 12:29.600
<i>What do you mean you’re not coming?</i>
<i>That was settled.</i>

12:30.720 --> 12:32.760
<i>It’s the third time already.</i>

12:33.400 --> 12:35.120
<i>Listen, you can’t do that. I--</i>

12:37.640 --> 12:38.640
<i>You know what?</i>

12:39.240 --> 12:41.360
<i>If you do this again, I--</i>

12:42.880 --> 12:43.880
<i>No, but--</i>

12:45.040 --> 12:46.680
-<i>All right, I--</i>
-Who’s she talking to?

12:46.760 --> 12:49.240
<i>I’ll call you later. I can’t. I’m working.</i>

12:49.320 --> 12:52.160
Take her phone and see who called her.

12:53.880 --> 12:55.640
At 7:54 p.m.

13:02.800 --> 13:04.440
<i>A few too many business cards.</i>

13:05.280 --> 13:06.760
She was a loving young woman.

13:07.800 --> 13:12.520
This time, and then 10 times more,
she called the same guy.

13:13.040 --> 13:15.080
<i>He’s your average manager.</i>

13:15.640 --> 13:17.200
<i>An office rat, so to speak.</i>

13:17.560 --> 13:18.760
Text me his address.

13:20.560 --> 13:21.560
Bye. That’s strange.

13:27.840 --> 13:31.000
She doesn’t seem the type
to go for for a warehouse manager.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.760
Even more so that she slept with him.

13:35.280 --> 13:38.560
Loneliness is tricky.

13:38.640 --> 13:41.080
It makes you turn a blind eye
to a lot of things.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.480
But sleeping with a suspect…

13:43.560 --> 13:45.800
Why? Is that different somehow?

13:48.560 --> 13:51.640
PROSPEKT VOROSHILOVA,
NUMBER 82 - BLDG. 3, APT. 5

13:59.920 --> 14:02.880
Listen,
I have no idea what you want from me.

14:05.640 --> 14:08.640
But if you don’t leave now,
I’ll call the police.

14:08.720 --> 14:11.760
We are the police-- police or militia.

14:12.120 --> 14:15.240
We need you to answer one question.

14:16.360 --> 14:17.880
What do you want from me?

14:18.680 --> 14:21.720
I only dated Larissa a few times.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.040
She was murdered today.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.080
You didn’t even show up.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.160
And you’ve turned off your phone.

14:43.400 --> 14:44.600
I was sick.

14:44.680 --> 14:47.200
I can show you an official note. I--

14:47.840 --> 14:50.000
A doctor came to see me.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.520
Listen.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.120
Listen.

14:55.760 --> 14:57.400
If I went to the hospital…

14:58.520 --> 15:00.200
You see, I’m a married man.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.240
They might misunderstand.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.320
Listen,
maybe we can come to an understanding?

15:07.400 --> 15:08.720
How much?

15:10.000 --> 15:11.240
Well, I don’t know.

15:11.880 --> 15:15.280
-$500.
-500 isn’t enough. What else?

15:15.680 --> 15:16.680
What else…

15:17.640 --> 15:19.880
-The watch.
-I don’t wear a watch.

15:19.960 --> 15:20.960
Where’s your wife?

15:21.880 --> 15:25.440
She’s in the hospital.
It’s serious. She has cancer.

15:25.960 --> 15:28.520
-Have pity, if only for her.
-Why would I?

15:29.080 --> 15:31.920
What does she have to do with it?
She’s in the hospital.

15:34.280 --> 15:35.920
Why should I pity you?

15:36.880 --> 15:38.960
So you were looking for a replacement,
huh?

15:41.160 --> 15:43.560
-Prudent?
-What do you mean?

15:43.640 --> 15:45.160
-Take off your pants.
-What?

15:45.240 --> 15:46.680
Take off your pants.

15:47.360 --> 15:48.280
If you say.

15:50.320 --> 15:51.560
If you say, but…

15:53.040 --> 15:54.040
Iron them. Quickly.

15:54.600 --> 15:56.400
Certainly.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.040
I see.

16:05.680 --> 16:08.640
So first your mommy
ironed your pants for you.

16:09.040 --> 16:10.040
Then your wife.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.040
Then she gets cancer. Whoops.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.400
No one to iron your pants anymore, huh?

16:15.480 --> 16:18.960
You started looking around.
After a while, you found Larissa.

16:19.760 --> 16:22.280
Larissa came to iron your pants, right?

16:24.920 --> 16:25.920
Right.

16:26.480 --> 16:29.720
You searched for single plain Janes
on purpose.

16:31.920 --> 16:33.360
She was the one who called.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.320
She said that she was leaving me,

16:38.400 --> 16:40.280
that she didn’t love me.

16:41.320 --> 16:43.880
She loved someone else,
had loved him all her life.

16:44.440 --> 16:47.440
I was a mistake. She didn’t even like me.

16:47.520 --> 16:48.720
No need to lie to me.

16:49.600 --> 16:53.640
People saw you running away
from her entryway.

17:01.080 --> 17:03.200
Well… Yes, I--

17:03.280 --> 17:04.480
I was there.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.520
I wanted to talk.
I thought I still had a chance.

17:10.960 --> 17:15.319
But when I went upstairs, I saw him.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.960
He was kneeling over her doing something.

17:19.760 --> 17:23.040
She was dead already.
I-- I couldn’t help her.

17:23.119 --> 17:26.160
What, should I have been killed too?

17:26.880 --> 17:28.440
Why are you looking at me like that?

17:28.960 --> 17:30.440
What did he look like?

17:30.520 --> 17:32.280
I don’t know. He… He had his back to me.

17:38.760 --> 17:39.760
Get well.

17:45.280 --> 17:46.080
Let’s go.

18:03.720 --> 18:05.560
Do you think he’s telling the truth?

18:05.640 --> 18:08.280
He never tells the truth,
not even to himself.

18:08.360 --> 18:10.440
-But he’s not the murderer.
-Why not?

18:10.520 --> 18:13.560
Did you see his hands? Soft like dough.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.920
They’re good for nothing.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.320
Do you think he’s capable
of creating such beauty?

18:30.160 --> 18:31.200
Play-dough.

18:31.280 --> 18:32.560
Open it.

18:33.640 --> 18:36.560
Actually,
they didn’t want to issue a warrant.

18:36.640 --> 18:38.160
Our prosecutor is headstrong.

18:38.640 --> 18:41.920
But I used my personal connections,
so it’s okay now.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
Well done.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.360
I’d had some…

18:47.440 --> 18:49.680
hanky-panky with his secretary.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.280
What about the prosecutor?

18:56.920 --> 18:59.880
Enough panting. Let me. There you go.

18:59.960 --> 19:00.960
Dismissed. Well…

19:03.680 --> 19:04.680
Come in.

19:06.640 --> 19:09.040
And you, go see your secretary.

19:11.440 --> 19:12.440
Asshole.

19:14.440 --> 19:16.600
I looked through the lists of residents--

19:17.840 --> 19:20.080
Tolmachev Pavel, 22 years old.

20:09.680 --> 20:10.880
Twenty-two? A diligent lad.

20:15.240 --> 20:17.440
-His name is Pavlik?
-Yes.

20:29.920 --> 20:30.920
He’s the murderer. Whoa.

20:40.000 --> 20:40.800
Steel.

20:42.120 --> 20:43.520
Handy thing.

20:46.000 --> 20:47.600
There must be two of them.

20:52.480 --> 20:54.480
Into the heart with some to spare.

21:00.120 --> 21:04.600
Twenty-two years old.
The award is dated 1979. It’s not his.

21:10.360 --> 21:11.600
Evgeny Tolmachev.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.480
His father? A dynasty?

21:20.720 --> 21:21.920
It turns out…

21:23.120 --> 21:26.080
the murderer she was looking for
was her neighbor.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.920
<i>It was his name that she wanted to write.</i>

21:33.000 --> 21:34.400
It was a good idea.

21:35.360 --> 21:36.640
I wish she had succeeded.

21:44.160 --> 21:45.160
Yes.

21:46.240 --> 21:49.560
He had been treated since he was 15--
genetic schizophrenia.

21:49.640 --> 21:52.560
No friends or acquaintances.
He hasn’t been home for seven years. He has nowhere to go,
meaning we don’t know where to look.

21:56.200 --> 21:59.080
-There’s always a place to go.
-Where did he go?

21:59.160 --> 22:01.760
I have a rough guess. We’d better check.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.800
PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL No. 13

22:56.080 --> 22:57.280
<i>Schizophrenia.</i>

22:58.000 --> 22:59.520
<i>Dual personality.</i>

23:01.400 --> 23:03.040
<i>A craving for violence.</i>

23:05.160 --> 23:07.160
I examined him 12 years ago.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.200
Then he was transferred
to a children’s hospital.

23:10.280 --> 23:12.120
I haven’t seen him since.

23:12.200 --> 23:13.920
His mother worked here.

23:14.760 --> 23:17.280
-What did she do?
-She was a psychiatrist.

23:18.760 --> 23:20.040
More details, please.

23:20.120 --> 23:23.440
-What are you interested in?
-Everything interests us.

23:23.840 --> 23:24.840
Fine.

23:25.720 --> 23:30.040
Diploma from the First Medical University,
with honors.

23:30.600 --> 23:32.640
Good-looking, smart.

23:34.040 --> 23:36.040
A doctor with an attitude.

23:36.120 --> 23:38.560
-What do you mean?
-No compassion. Removed in her childhood
together with her glands.

23:41.160 --> 23:43.480
Not compassion-- pity.

23:44.720 --> 23:46.040
Pity does no good.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.160
Then she got married.

23:50.000 --> 23:52.240
-He was gifted.
-Calm down!

23:52.320 --> 23:53.440
But a schizophrenic.

23:53.520 --> 23:57.560
Not unusual for gifted people.
They don’t have to drive a trolley.

23:57.640 --> 23:59.320
She considered him a genius.

24:00.680 --> 24:04.000
But genius isn’t compatible with villainy.

24:05.080 --> 24:08.480
But it goes hand in hand with madness.

24:11.320 --> 24:12.760
Then he started to leave us.

24:13.440 --> 24:14.320
Where to?

24:15.840 --> 24:17.040
Away from us.

24:20.080 --> 24:25.160
He had increasingly frequent headaches,
tension, anxiety.

24:25.240 --> 24:27.000
I told her to bring him to me.

24:27.720 --> 24:31.640
I talked to him
and diagnosed schizophrenia.

24:34.200 --> 24:38.320
He needed to be treated here,
in the intensive care unit.

24:39.120 --> 24:42.200
But she didn’t want to.
Get him out of here.

24:45.560 --> 24:47.040
He didn’t want to.

24:47.120 --> 24:50.920
She feared
the hospital would traumatize him.

24:51.000 --> 24:51.800
A genius.

24:51.880 --> 24:53.720
She decided to treat him at home.

24:54.680 --> 24:57.560
Both doctor and wife. Who if not she?

24:57.640 --> 24:59.840
Their son was born during that time.

24:59.920 --> 25:01.520
-Pavel.
-Yes.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.640
The craving for violence is a disease.

25:03.720 --> 25:04.720
It’s passed on…

25:05.720 --> 25:06.960
from father to son.

25:08.480 --> 25:09.920
From mother to daughter.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.800
She had a hard time of it.

25:12.880 --> 25:16.680
But she was proud of herself.
Her husband seemed to get better.

25:16.760 --> 25:19.720
A big exhibit was organized in Moscow.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.520
She invited me.

25:23.360 --> 25:25.200
I took a look.

25:25.280 --> 25:26.400
It was a sensation.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.440
Everybody was shouting,
“Genius, genius, genius!”

25:29.160 --> 25:34.040
I looked at those outfits, went to her
and told her that she was wrong.

25:34.880 --> 25:36.200
He got worse.

25:36.880 --> 25:38.160
What did you see?

25:39.680 --> 25:42.440
Cuts on the dresses.

25:42.520 --> 25:45.160
They looked like wounds.

25:48.160 --> 25:50.720
She thought she had conquered the disease.

25:53.200 --> 25:55.680
But it only got worse.

25:57.320 --> 25:59.120
He had this craving for pain.

25:59.600 --> 26:02.760
A craving for… violence.

26:03.360 --> 26:04.920
One day, he tried…

26:06.040 --> 26:08.400
to cut off his fingers with scissors.

26:11.400 --> 26:13.800
She started locking him in the apartment.

26:14.320 --> 26:18.400
To keep him away any stimulus.

26:18.480 --> 26:22.360
One day, she came home and saw him
flailing around like a blind man.

26:24.120 --> 26:25.440
He’d sewn his eyelids shut.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.040
What happened next?

26:33.120 --> 26:35.920
He died half a year later. Here.

26:36.840 --> 26:40.440
Irina stopped working.
She dedicated herself to her son.

26:42.240 --> 26:44.040
She feared he had the same condition.

26:45.040 --> 26:48.720
Seven years later, she committed suicide.

26:49.560 --> 26:52.280
-She gassed herself.
-It wasn’t gas that killed her.

26:54.920 --> 26:56.520
The mania of saving people.

26:57.400 --> 26:58.600
Well, once you’re here…

26:59.400 --> 27:00.920
What are you complaining about?

27:01.840 --> 27:04.240
Come on, come on. Move.

27:04.960 --> 27:06.800
What’s so funny? Calm down!

27:08.800 --> 27:10.200
Do you know that joke?

27:10.280 --> 27:12.520
A doctor asks his patient,
“Do you have any complaints?”

27:12.600 --> 27:15.960
The patient says,
“Doctor, I don’t complain. I suffer.”

28:12.280 --> 28:13.000
That’s all.

28:15.200 --> 28:18.520
In not too long… I’ll be dangerous.

28:20.640 --> 28:21.960
To myself and to others.

28:22.040 --> 28:23.640
And then it’s a direct path…

28:24.960 --> 28:26.440
to catalepsy.

28:28.400 --> 28:29.960
They’ll tie me up like a goat

28:30.040 --> 28:32.040
and stick needles in me… like a cactus.

28:36.560 --> 28:38.440
That’s why the syringe is always close by?

28:39.640 --> 28:42.560
It would be more appropriate
for an officer to shoot himself.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.600
But maniacs aren’t trusted with guns.

28:48.040 --> 28:49.440
But morphine is…

28:50.480 --> 28:52.120
just what the doctor ordered.

28:54.160 --> 28:55.560
Literally.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.280
I’ll simply hide, Esenya.

29:03.520 --> 29:04.800
I’ve earned it.

29:10.720 --> 29:12.360
Only one thing stops me.

29:13.080 --> 29:16.520
I’ll hide, but what will happen to them--

29:18.080 --> 29:19.440
to our kind?

29:21.240 --> 29:22.640
Tell me the truth.

29:24.560 --> 29:27.400
You took me on so you could
hand over the post when the time comes?

29:30.360 --> 29:31.600
At first, yes.

29:40.680 --> 29:42.400
Then I got used to you.

29:51.680 --> 29:52.480
So…

29:54.240 --> 29:55.520
go for a walk?

29:58.400 --> 30:01.120
Do you find the autumn here
to your liking?

30:02.320 --> 30:04.800
I’m off. I have things to do.

30:04.880 --> 30:07.680
You stay here.
Vadim Mikhalich will show you around.

30:07.760 --> 30:08.840
Show me what?

30:08.920 --> 30:10.600
He’ll definitely come here.

30:10.680 --> 30:13.720
Stay here for a couple of days, observe.

30:14.400 --> 30:17.400
Take walks. See how beautiful it is?

32:08.480 --> 32:09.680
Pavlik. Pavlik.

32:46.200 --> 32:48.280
What have you done, Pavlik?

33:08.600 --> 33:10.000
Berestova.

33:16.400 --> 33:19.040
<i>Your father was the lead investigator</i>
<i>in the Olga Berestova case.</i>

33:19.720 --> 33:21.200
A very beautiful woman.

33:25.720 --> 33:26.720
Uh-huh.

33:28.800 --> 33:29.760
Menshikov.

33:39.760 --> 33:40.960
Ivanova.

33:47.240 --> 33:48.080
Egorova.

33:59.840 --> 34:00.840
Esenya.

34:04.600 --> 34:05.680
How did you know?

34:06.360 --> 34:07.760
I met with Rodion.

34:08.800 --> 34:10.719
How do you like it here? Not scary?

34:11.159 --> 34:13.000
Is this how you imagined your training?

34:13.360 --> 34:16.639
-I don’t know what you’re getting at.
-I’m tired of explaining.

34:17.440 --> 34:20.600
There’s an old saying: “You can’t
do any good without using your fists.”

34:20.679 --> 34:22.639
Or a knife, if you’re Meglin.

34:23.360 --> 34:25.920
I not begging you anymore.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.199
I initiated an internal investigation
into his actions.

34:28.280 --> 34:30.400
He’s not right in the head,
and you know it.

34:53.480 --> 34:55.000
What’s going on with you?

34:56.239 --> 34:57.440
Can you tell me?

34:58.480 --> 34:59.680
This is on purpose?

34:59.760 --> 35:01.040
Go away.

38:51.840 --> 38:53.240
Hey, come here! Have you seen everything?

39:55.880 --> 39:56.880
Yes.

40:01.240 --> 40:02.560
You’re all set.

40:06.080 --> 40:08.120
A syringe, morphine.

40:08.880 --> 40:10.680
You hide out, and voilà--
you’re home free.

40:10.760 --> 40:14.400
But you’ve overlooked one thing.
I won’t let you die.

40:19.840 --> 40:21.360
Shall we talk business?

40:23.840 --> 40:24.840
Let’s talk.

40:26.800 --> 40:29.400
-He hasn’t showed up.
-Of course not.

40:31.360 --> 40:35.680
He knows that if he comes in here,
with his clinical history,

40:36.240 --> 40:38.000
he’s unlikely to ever get out.

40:39.400 --> 40:40.800
I talked to his neighbors.

40:41.400 --> 40:44.000
They say Pavlik and Larissa were friends.

40:44.600 --> 40:47.400
He called on her sometimes,
met her at the entryway…

40:48.520 --> 40:50.200
helped her carry her bags.

40:50.800 --> 40:52.320
A paradox, right?

40:52.960 --> 40:56.960
She tried to catch him at work.
He had tea with her at night.

40:57.880 --> 40:59.400
I can’t help thinking,

40:59.480 --> 41:03.960
what if someone
made the poor guy some tea,

41:04.360 --> 41:06.160
asked him how he was getting along,

41:06.240 --> 41:08.720
perhaps he wouldn’t have killed anybody.

41:09.240 --> 41:11.160
Maybe I’m wrong.

41:11.240 --> 41:15.320
They say that an investigator shouldn’t
pity murderers, but seek them out.

41:15.920 --> 41:18.280
I don’t know. Maybe I should change jobs?

41:43.240 --> 41:44.240
Pavlik.

41:46.320 --> 41:48.760
Was that… you?

42:00.080 --> 42:02.200
What have you done?

42:03.080 --> 42:05.280
What have you done, Pavlik?

42:31.080 --> 42:33.080
Who’d expect that from a neighbor?

42:34.040 --> 42:37.480
-Killing women similar to his mother.
-Similar how?

42:42.160 --> 42:43.360
The look, Pavlik.

42:44.400 --> 42:47.000
How your victims looked at you is the key.

43:53.880 --> 43:54.880
Finished? Let’s go.

44:19.880 --> 44:22.840
That look makes you feel guilty.

44:24.680 --> 44:27.760
It’s a disturbing feeling.
That’s why the portraits.

44:31.520 --> 44:35.640
What? All us psychopaths are suspicious.

44:37.880 --> 44:39.560
He’ll be declared insane,

44:40.120 --> 44:43.640
and he’ll stay here
until he’s completely healthy.

44:44.480 --> 44:46.040
Which means until the end of his days.

44:47.880 --> 44:49.800
Why not? Breakfast, lunch, dinner.

44:51.040 --> 44:52.440
Walks, activities.

44:53.880 --> 44:55.840
There’s a park, benches.

45:01.160 --> 45:02.680
The same routine--

45:02.760 --> 45:05.760
winter, spring, summer, autumn.

45:07.040 --> 45:08.440
For life.

45:09.920 --> 45:11.440
Though that is no life.

45:12.640 --> 45:13.640
It’s a death. Slow…

45:17.280 --> 45:18.600
with eyes open.

45:24.840 --> 45:25.840
Huh, Pavlik?

46:09.800 --> 46:11.000
Take him in.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.440
Do you despise me?

46:40.400 --> 46:41.400
No.

47:27.440 --> 47:29.520
You left me at the hospital

47:29.600 --> 47:33.360
not just so I’d learn
why you keep the morphine with you.

47:36.200 --> 47:38.320
You knew I’d see Berestova.

47:41.320 --> 47:42.520
I recognized her.

47:44.720 --> 47:46.040
But Dad didn’t.

47:47.520 --> 47:48.520
Why not?

47:56.160 --> 47:58.160
He worked on her case. They must remember each other.

48:08.760 --> 48:10.440
The past is better forgotten.

48:11.320 --> 48:14.480
The future… is better unknown.

48:49.920 --> 48:50.920
Can’t sleep?

49:01.560 --> 49:03.720
You know, I was thinking,

49:03.800 --> 49:06.280
what if you want to tell me something,

49:06.360 --> 49:08.000
but you’re afraid I won’t understand?

49:11.000 --> 49:13.200
-Well, I will.
-You won’t.

50:03.840 --> 50:05.320
I made keys for you…

50:08.040 --> 50:10.000
so that you’ll always have a place to go.

51:10.280 --> 51:11.880
This is our home now.

51:13.480 --> 51:15.360
Keep it safe, all right?

51:52.640 --> 51:55.440
You say he put me at risk.

51:55.520 --> 51:57.560
Yes, that’s true.

51:57.640 --> 52:00.640
But how else can you learn to survive?

52:01.360 --> 52:04.960
He didn’t spare me because he wanted me
to learn my own lessons.

52:05.040 --> 52:06.480
How?

52:08.160 --> 52:10.760
He taught me
to find a way in the darkness.

52:19.480 --> 52:20.880
ZASLAVSK / SCHOOL No. 23

52:20.960 --> 52:23.720
The self-induced EMF
produced in the coil itself

52:24.160 --> 52:28.360
by changing the current flowing through it

52:28.440 --> 52:32.200
is called self inductance.

52:32.640 --> 52:39.360
Induced EMF in this case
is self-induced EMF.

52:40.160 --> 52:41.560
Let’s do an experiment.

52:41.640 --> 52:43.680
MANIFESTO
Read my manifesto and do as I do!
