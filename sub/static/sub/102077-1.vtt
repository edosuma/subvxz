ears back at base camp.

18:20.664 --> 18:22.449
She is an expert on
everything you need to know

18:22.536 --> 18:24.320
about what you will be hunting.

18:24.407 --> 18:26.453
Ms. Kelso, please tell my
team what they'’re up against.

18:26.540 --> 18:28.846
You are dealing
with two genetically-grown

18:28.933 --> 18:31.240
live and fully
matured allosauruses.

18:31.327 --> 18:33.068
And you have seen
them in action.

18:33.155 --> 18:35.636
Yes. Like grizzly bear
with body armor!

18:35.723 --> 18:37.725
Because these are
highly valuable assets,

18:37.812 --> 18:39.901
you are to only use deadly
force as a last resort.

18:39.988 --> 18:43.252
Instead, you'’ll be using
some specially designed AR-15s

18:43.339 --> 18:45.428
with a high-impact
tranquilizer round.

18:45.515 --> 18:48.475
AR-15? What?
We'’re hunting deer?

18:48.562 --> 18:50.999
Sir, you know we work best
with our own weapons.

18:51.086 --> 18:53.741
You will adapt, soldier.

18:53.828 --> 18:55.743
Remember what you
were hired to do.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.136
I don'’t like this one bit.

18:57.223 --> 18:59.094
It'’s not for you
to like, Deacon.

19:00.443 --> 19:03.185
You'’re here to follow orders.

19:03.272 --> 19:04.404
Are you going to
have a hard time doing that

19:04.491 --> 19:05.579
this time around?

19:05.666 --> 19:07.581
No, sir.

19:07.668 --> 19:10.845
As I said, you are only to use
deadly force as a last resort.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.849
And I know some of
you are as deadly

19:14.936 --> 19:16.546
with your hands and feet

19:16.633 --> 19:21.638
as you are with
swords and guns and knives.

19:21.725 --> 19:23.640
Last resort, soldier!

19:23.727 --> 19:25.381
[ALL]
Yes, sir!

19:25.468 --> 19:27.557
Each of you will also be wearing
a live-linked tracker

19:27.644 --> 19:29.516
so we can monitor your
every movement from here.

19:29.603 --> 19:31.605
We'’ll sweep the outside
of the building first.

19:31.692 --> 19:34.042
See if we can force them
into an enclosed area.

19:34.129 --> 19:39.134
We'’ll split up into usual
two teams, Red east, Blue west.

19:39.221 --> 19:40.483
Are we clear?

19:40.570 --> 19:41.484
[ALL]
Yes, sir!

19:41.571 --> 19:42.485
Let'’s go.

19:42.572 --> 19:43.791
Be careful.

19:49.231 --> 19:50.885
Red Team, head east!

19:50.972 --> 19:52.321
Blue Team, with me!

19:55.411 --> 19:56.847
Comm check, Joy.

19:56.934 --> 19:59.241
Check.

19:59.328 --> 20:00.373
Gordon.

20:00.460 --> 20:01.591
Check.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.814
Yeah, it'’s me.
We'’re running a little late.

20:06.901 --> 20:08.598
Well, don'’t screw this up.

20:08.685 --> 20:10.557
You know how valuable
this product is.

20:10.644 --> 20:12.385
And how important that
this test goes smoothly.

20:12.472 --> 20:16.432
Yes. They'’re already on
them right now.

20:16.519 --> 20:18.391
We'’ve worked too long
and too hard

20:18.478 --> 20:20.523
to just watch
this thing fail.

20:20.610 --> 20:25.006
Now you realize how important
it is that this test succeed.

20:27.791 --> 20:30.185
Okay. Will do.

20:30.272 --> 20:32.231
I don'’t want to have to send
in the drones, Simone.

20:34.929 --> 20:36.322
Okay. Bye.

20:39.977 --> 20:43.546
Red Team heading east.
So far, no signs of the target.

20:43.633 --> 20:46.462
Got you, Red Team. All right, listen up, everyone.

20:46.549 --> 20:49.073
We have approximately
3,200 civilians

20:49.160 --> 20:51.859
only five clicks away
from here just to the north.

20:51.946 --> 20:53.948
We need to bring
those targets alive.

20:55.515 --> 20:57.865
But our main goal
is to make sure

20:57.952 --> 20:59.910
they don'’t get out of
the industrial park.

20:59.997 --> 21:02.826
Stay alert.
Stay frosty.

21:02.913 --> 21:06.003
Don'’t assume that a dinosaur
can'’t catch you by surprise.

21:06.090 --> 21:11.226
I repeat, no matter what you do, keep them from getting out.

21:11.313 --> 21:13.446
-Copy that.
-Copy that.

21:13.533 --> 21:14.838
Copy that.

21:25.849 --> 21:27.547
[ growling ]

21:36.817 --> 21:38.601
Mutant dinosaurs?

21:38.688 --> 21:40.951
Yeah. I still don'’t know
how that'’s even possible.

21:41.038 --> 21:45.739
With enough money, everything'’s
possible, even dinosaurs.

21:47.436 --> 21:49.656
Keep the chatter to a minimum,
Red Team.

21:49.743 --> 21:51.266
Just find the targets.

21:52.876 --> 21:54.878
[ man screams ]

21:54.965 --> 21:58.839
We heard screaming.
We'’re going to check it out.

21:58.926 --> 22:00.623
Copy that, Red Team.

22:00.710 --> 22:04.018
Our initial scan showed no
signs of civilians present.

22:04.105 --> 22:05.933
Use caution, but find out
if we'’re already

22:06.020 --> 22:07.717
looking at civilian casualties.

22:20.556 --> 22:23.080
Base, we have a handprint.

22:23.167 --> 22:26.345
Appears to be blood, no bodies.

22:27.781 --> 22:29.086
Copy, Red Team.

22:29.173 --> 22:31.698
Watch your six
for those grizzlies.

22:31.785 --> 22:34.004
There'’s literally nothing.

22:34.091 --> 22:35.789
Did they eat them?

22:35.876 --> 22:40.359
I don'’t know, but
if this is human blood,

22:40.446 --> 22:42.404
there'’s no way they survived.

22:42.491 --> 22:44.450
[ roaring ]

22:48.192 --> 22:50.281
I'’m gonna go find higher ground.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.718
Try to see
them through my scope.

22:51.805 --> 22:53.372
Good idea.
I'’ll follow the tracks.

22:58.812 --> 23:01.292
Gordon, why are you breaking
apart from your partner?

23:02.946 --> 23:05.253
Where are you going?

23:05.340 --> 23:06.863
We need eyes in the sky.

23:11.999 --> 23:16.307
He is a sniper.
That'’s why he'’s here.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.048
Copy that, Red Team.

23:18.135 --> 23:19.702
Give me a visual from above.
Let me know what you see.

23:29.843 --> 23:33.150
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

23:33.237 --> 23:36.284
You have all been invited
for a very specific reason.

23:36.371 --> 23:40.114
Your GDP allows you to purchase
the product we'’re selling.

23:40.201 --> 23:43.204
Now in the interest of
security and confidentiality,

23:43.291 --> 23:46.381
all participants will
remain anonymous

23:46.468 --> 23:48.731
whether you purchase
our product or not.

23:48.818 --> 23:52.169
Now what exactly are we selling?

23:52.256 --> 23:58.262
Genetically-enhanced dinosaurs
with advanced combat abilities.

23:58.349 --> 24:00.656
This miracle rides
on the backs

24:00.743 --> 24:03.267
of those that have come
before that paved the way.

24:03.354 --> 24:05.400
These military prototypes
have been developed

24:05.487 --> 24:07.620
from the initial experiments
of Dr. Martinelli

24:07.707 --> 24:09.796
at the Triassic
Research Facility.

24:12.494 --> 24:16.150
This is unlike anything
anyone has ever seen before.

24:16.237 --> 24:18.500
Not only is it the
most significant breakthrough

24:18.587 --> 24:22.286
in modern science at the cost of
hundreds of millions of dollars,

24:22.373 --> 24:25.072
but it is also
the biggest breakthrough

24:25.159 --> 24:30.599
in biological warfare since
the invention of gunpowder.

24:30.686 --> 24:31.992
No longer will nations
need to send...

24:32.079 --> 24:33.733
Oh, my God.

24:33.820 --> 24:35.648
...their young men and women
onto the battlefield

24:35.735 --> 24:38.564
to die for their
country or their cause.

24:38.651 --> 24:42.306
PTSD, collateral damage and
all the horrors of war

24:42.393 --> 24:45.919
and conflict will become
a relic of the past.

24:46.006 --> 24:49.270
Mr. Hagan, this is Dr. Ovidio,
our chief immunologist.

24:49.357 --> 24:52.142
He takes care of the animals and
make sure their organs

24:52.229 --> 24:53.709
are appropriate
for transplantation.

24:53.796 --> 24:56.146
Charles.

24:56.233 --> 25:01.412
This was all I ever wanted
when I was like nine years old.

25:01.500 --> 25:05.808
And now here you are

25:05.895 --> 25:08.289
after millions of
years of extinction.

25:08.376 --> 25:10.160
Don'’t get near it.

25:10.247 --> 25:12.859
No, it'’s okay.
This is G-48.

25:12.946 --> 25:16.906
She'’s actually responsible
for the whole G series.

25:16.993 --> 25:18.952
I have to admit, Marissa,
I was more than

25:19.039 --> 25:22.259
a little skeptical you had
real live dinosaurs here.

25:22.346 --> 25:24.610
That'’s why I had to come.

25:24.697 --> 25:28.396
I didn'’t believe it, but now...

25:28.483 --> 25:31.007
We make miracles happen
here every day.

25:32.922 --> 25:38.188
This miracle, my friend,
is our new and improved product.

25:38.275 --> 25:42.279
The bidding will start at
$500 million dollars each.

25:42.366 --> 25:43.933
We have two currently available.

25:46.806 --> 25:49.417
Why so expensive?

25:49.504 --> 25:52.725
You will be purchasing the
most ferocious combat soldiers

25:52.812 --> 25:55.162
to ever walk the face
of the earth

25:55.249 --> 25:57.773
unencumbered
by morality or ethics.

26:01.255 --> 26:06.216
Now we'’ve arranged a little
demonstration for you.

26:06.303 --> 26:09.045
I'’ve hired the most deadly
mercenaries that money can buy

26:09.132 --> 26:11.961
and pitted them against
our allosauruses.

26:12.048 --> 26:14.094
If you watch on your computer
screen, you will see live

26:14.181 --> 26:18.881
and in real time just how
valuable an asset this is.

26:18.968 --> 26:19.969
Enjoy the show.

26:31.067 --> 26:33.156
This place is creepy.

26:33.243 --> 26:34.854
Oh, it'’s old and quiet.

26:34.941 --> 26:36.856
Old and quiet is always creepy.

26:36.943 --> 26:38.684
It'’s not what I mean.

26:38.771 --> 26:42.470
It'’s empty, sitting
in the middle of nowhere.

26:42.557 --> 26:43.558
There'’s nothing here.

26:43.645 --> 26:46.605
Just us and those things.

26:47.997 --> 26:50.347
There!
Broken glass.

26:50.434 --> 26:51.610
We found something!

26:54.351 --> 26:55.788
They'’re here.

26:55.875 --> 26:57.006
How can you tell?

26:57.093 --> 27:00.488
These edges, they'’re fresh.

27:00.575 --> 27:02.098
If this glass
was broken any longer,

27:02.185 --> 27:04.144
then there'’d be dust and
dirt covering the edges.

27:04.231 --> 27:06.363
-Hmm.
-This is new.

27:06.450 --> 27:10.193
They'’re either inside
this building or they were.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.418
Be on the lookout.

27:22.684 --> 27:24.120
They tend to stick together.

27:24.207 --> 27:26.166
But that doesn'’t mean
they always will.

27:26.253 --> 27:28.777
But they usually hide where it'’s
dark and maybe a little damp.

27:28.864 --> 27:30.823
What do they want
with someplace dark and damp?

27:33.695 --> 27:37.177
They'’re nocturnal and that'’ll
remind them of the lab.

27:37.264 --> 27:39.135
They need to know.

27:39.222 --> 27:40.528
Know what?

27:40.615 --> 27:42.138
No, they don'’t.

27:42.225 --> 27:43.923
How much do you want to
keep from them just

27:44.010 --> 27:46.752
to protect secrets that
could help them to help us?

27:46.839 --> 27:49.624
Tell me.

27:49.711 --> 27:52.583
Uh, if there'’s something I need
to tell you that'’s important,

27:52.671 --> 27:54.542
I'’ll let you know.

27:54.629 --> 27:56.457
I decide what'’s important.

27:56.544 --> 27:57.850
That means
bringing your creatures

27:57.937 --> 27:59.982
back alive and
keeping my men safe!

28:00.069 --> 28:01.331
Now tell me!

28:04.117 --> 28:05.292
One of them is pregnant.

28:07.729 --> 28:09.731
And you weren'’t gonna
tell me this?

28:09.818 --> 28:11.124
Doesn'’t that make
the assets more valuable?

28:11.211 --> 28:13.082
Of course, it does.

28:13.169 --> 28:17.130
Transporting two allosauruses
to Costa Rica is tough enough,

28:17.217 --> 28:18.827
let alone two with an egg.

28:18.914 --> 28:20.089
An egg?

28:20.176 --> 28:21.569
No, not an egg.

28:21.656 --> 28:23.223
Nothing anyone has
even seen before.

28:23.310 --> 28:26.182
We'’re talking about
life created from life

28:26.269 --> 28:28.054
that was created
in a petri dish.

28:28.141 --> 28:29.838
Don'’t you get it?

28:29.925 --> 28:35.539
Elaine has made dozens of them,
but they all failed.

28:35.626 --> 28:38.151
Sterile, they died.

28:38.238 --> 28:41.676
What this is is something the
world'’s never seen before.

28:41.763 --> 28:45.506
What? One that can get
another one pregnant?

28:45.593 --> 28:48.378
No, not just that.
Survivors.

28:48.465 --> 28:49.771
These are the only
two test subjects

28:49.858 --> 28:50.946
to ever leave
that building alive.

28:58.388 --> 29:00.173
Go for Deacon?

29:00.260 --> 29:01.304
Deacon here.

29:01.391 --> 29:03.872
One of them might be pregnant.

29:03.959 --> 29:06.614
That'’s supposed
to mean something?

29:06.701 --> 29:10.226
Mama bear.
Things could get hairy.

29:10.313 --> 29:11.575
Copy that.

29:13.360 --> 29:15.101
You okay?

29:15.188 --> 29:17.668
100%.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.279
You brought some
shit up earlier with Joy

29:19.366 --> 29:20.541
when you first saw her.

29:20.628 --> 29:22.673
I need you to be on your game.

29:22.761 --> 29:23.979
We'’re good.

29:25.764 --> 29:26.677
I'’m counting on it.

29:30.769 --> 29:31.900
Base, we got more blood.

29:33.989 --> 29:35.904
Go, Red Team!

29:35.991 --> 29:40.430
Same as before.
Lots of blood, no bodies.

29:40.517 --> 29:43.259
They'’re building a territory,
setting up their own perimeter.

29:43.346 --> 29:45.261
Like soldiers.

29:47.655 --> 29:49.700
More like wolves.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.441
Help me...

29:51.528 --> 29:53.574
I'’ve got a civilian! I repeat!
I got a civilian!

29:53.661 --> 29:55.141
He'’s down and needs
medic immediately!

29:56.490 --> 29:57.708
Wait, no. No, no, no.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.058
That doesn'’t make any sense.

29:59.145 --> 30:00.059
They wouldn'’t do that.

30:00.146 --> 30:01.625
What do you mean?

30:01.712 --> 30:03.062
They wouldn'’t have
left anyone there.

30:03.149 --> 30:04.150
They wouldn'’t have
left him alive.

30:04.237 --> 30:05.194
You'’ve seen this before?

30:07.631 --> 30:09.764
Red Team! Stand down!

30:09.851 --> 30:11.331
Back up and stand down!

30:11.418 --> 30:13.463
What? I said I'’ve got an
injured civilian!

30:13.550 --> 30:15.291
No, they'’re luring you in.
It'’s a trap!

30:15.378 --> 30:16.858
Red Team, fall back!

30:16.945 --> 30:19.339
That'’s an order,
fall back now!

30:19.426 --> 30:21.167
[ roaring ]

30:21.254 --> 30:22.995
Listen to me.
Get out of there now!

30:23.082 --> 30:25.954
Too late for that now, Sarge.

30:26.041 --> 30:27.129
[ roaring ]

30:28.261 --> 30:29.653
[ shouts ]

30:30.741 --> 30:32.178
Red Team, come in!

30:32.265 --> 30:33.570
Red Team, do you read me?

30:33.657 --> 30:35.137
Nick! Nick!
Do you hear me?

30:35.224 --> 30:36.399
Damn it!

30:42.101 --> 30:44.364
Base, Red Team clear.

30:44.451 --> 30:47.584
Not sure what happened, target
just stopped its pursuit.

30:47.671 --> 30:49.717
Copy that, Red Team.
And the civilian?

30:49.804 --> 30:52.546
Target took him,
snapped the guy'’s neck.

30:54.113 --> 30:55.766
Target'’s headed north,

30:55.854 --> 30:57.638
I'’m below,
Gordon'’s still above.

30:57.725 --> 31:00.554
Copy that, Red Team.
Gordon, check in.

31:00.641 --> 31:01.685
Nick, you good?

31:01.772 --> 31:04.036
-[ roaring ]
-Whoa!

31:04.123 --> 31:06.560
I got one.

31:06.647 --> 31:08.823
I'’m pinned
down behind some trash.

31:08.910 --> 31:10.259
Weapon'’s out of reach.

31:10.346 --> 31:12.218
Gordon, what'’s your twenty?

31:12.305 --> 31:13.828
I'’m at the tall building,
north of where I left you.

31:13.915 --> 31:16.135
Half a click.

31:16.222 --> 31:17.658
I'’ll be there.

31:17.745 --> 31:19.355
Gordon needs help.
He'’s pinned down.

31:19.442 --> 31:21.836
Hey, Gordon? Find something
to hide your scent.

31:21.923 --> 31:23.316
It'’ll be your best chance.

31:27.581 --> 31:28.582
I'’m on my way.

31:35.763 --> 31:37.896
Nick, take it nice and slow.

31:37.983 --> 31:39.549
Stay out of sight
and see if you can approach

31:39.636 --> 31:41.203
from around the back side.

31:41.290 --> 31:43.510
These dinosaurs have
excellent hearing,

31:43.597 --> 31:46.165
so keep your voice
low on comms.

31:46.252 --> 31:47.383
Copy that.

31:55.609 --> 31:57.350
I'’ve got eyes.

31:57.437 --> 31:58.917
I'’m just around the corner.

31:59.004 --> 32:01.528
Copy that.

32:01.615 --> 32:03.747
On the count of three,
we'’ll both jump out and fire.

32:03.834 --> 32:05.227
He'’ll be at your twelve.

32:07.490 --> 32:10.841
Three, two, one!

32:15.063 --> 32:17.152
Damn it.

32:17.239 --> 32:18.197
Where'’d it go?

32:20.851 --> 32:22.244
See it?

32:23.593 --> 32:25.160
Where the hell did it go?

32:25.247 --> 32:26.335
It'’s another trap.

32:26.422 --> 32:27.989
Are you kidding me?

32:28.076 --> 32:29.773
No. It'’s Ozzie.
He'’s protecting Harriet.

32:29.860 --> 32:30.861
What does that mean?

32:30.949 --> 32:32.689
He'’s the male.

32:32.776 --> 32:34.996
He'’s leading them away from
Harriet to keep her safe.

32:35.083 --> 32:36.258
He'’s gonna wait until
they'’re further away from her

32:36.345 --> 32:37.781
before he attacks again.

32:37.868 --> 32:40.523
Red Team, get out
of sight immediately!

32:40.610 --> 32:42.873
You can'’t see the target,
but he sees you.

32:45.006 --> 32:46.573
Take cover and wait.

32:52.187 --> 32:53.797
[ roaring ]

32:53.884 --> 32:55.843
[ gunfire ]

32:55.930 --> 32:58.628
The tranqs don'’t work!
They'’re bouncing off his skin!

32:58.715 --> 33:00.195
Try shooting on the nose.

33:00.282 --> 33:01.501
It'’s the softest
part of the skin.

33:01.588 --> 33:03.285
Now you tell us that?

33:07.246 --> 33:09.639
We lost it.
It got away.

33:09.726 --> 33:11.815
What do you mean, you lost it?

33:11.902 --> 33:13.600
I mean we lost it.

33:13.687 --> 33:16.385
Target'’s on the move again,
headed southeast.

33:16.472 --> 33:17.473
Damn it!

33:17.560 --> 33:19.867
-Sarge?
-Yeah?

33:19.954 --> 33:21.869
I never seen anything
like that before.

33:21.956 --> 33:24.393
Those tranqs might as
well have been rock salt.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.221
Barely slowed it down.

33:26.308 --> 33:28.223
Copy that.
Watch your six.

33:28.310 --> 33:29.703
Listen up, everyone.

33:29.790 --> 33:31.966
We aren'’t dealing
with grizzlies here.

33:32.053 --> 33:35.926
These are polar bear.
I repeat, these are polar bear.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.145
Copy that.

33:37.232 --> 33:38.886
What does that mean?

33:38.973 --> 33:40.801
A grizzly bear will do
anything to protect its cub

33:40.888 --> 33:42.368
and its territory.

33:42.455 --> 33:44.761
But they won'’t
actively hunt humans.

33:44.848 --> 33:46.154
And a polar bear?

33:46.241 --> 33:48.374
A polar bear is the only
animal that will

33:48.461 --> 33:50.724
actually hunt and eat humans.

33:59.211 --> 34:01.082
Blue Team, stay alert.

34:01.169 --> 34:02.866
We don'’t know where either
target could be hiding.

34:02.953 --> 34:05.347
-Copy that.
-Copy that.

34:05.434 --> 34:07.741
Gordon, which direction
did it head?

34:10.004 --> 34:12.528
Southeast toward the edge
of the perimeter.

34:12.615 --> 34:15.792
Can'’t see it.
That thing is fast and sneaky.

34:15.879 --> 34:17.577
I'’m all set here.

34:17.664 --> 34:20.058
Okay. I'’m going hunting.

34:20.145 --> 34:23.626
Oh, Nick, try not to get eaten.

34:23.713 --> 34:24.801
I'’ll try.

34:24.888 --> 34:26.629
Here.

34:26.716 --> 34:28.240
This is the midway point
between where we saw

34:28.327 --> 34:30.329
the broken glass and
where Red Team engaged.

34:30.416 --> 34:33.549
If one of them headed southeast,
this is the spot to cut it off.

34:36.335 --> 34:37.597
You'’re the tracker.

34:43.820 --> 34:45.648
I thought you were dead,
you know.

34:45.735 --> 34:47.041
What?

34:47.128 --> 34:50.479
Pakistan.
I thought they killed you.

34:50.566 --> 34:53.700
Is that why you
abandoned me there?

34:53.787 --> 34:55.093
I didn'’t abandon you.

34:58.183 --> 35:00.228
I mourned you.

35:00.315 --> 35:02.056
They sent me your dog tags.

35:02.143 --> 35:04.711
I didn'’t know a thing that
happened for six months.

35:04.798 --> 35:06.191
And even then,
you didn'’t reach out.

35:06.278 --> 35:08.236
I couldn'’t.
We had our orders.

35:08.323 --> 35:09.542
There was a reason
it was a two-person crew,

35:09.629 --> 35:11.196
and it was
to keep things quiet.

35:11.283 --> 35:13.154
We couldn'’t even
contact our team.

35:13.241 --> 35:15.722
Yeah, but I did and
that'’s how I got out of there.

35:15.809 --> 35:18.072
They got me out
when you left me for dead.

35:19.682 --> 35:20.596
Karl?

35:23.164 --> 35:25.340
I thought you knew me
better than that.

35:25.427 --> 35:27.125
I know that you and
I made the same mistake

35:27.212 --> 35:28.909
that nearly got me wiped out

35:28.996 --> 35:31.346
and you thinking
for six months that I was dead.

35:31.433 --> 35:34.132
You and I got too close.

35:34.219 --> 35:35.133
Yes, we did.

35:36.612 --> 35:38.048
I'’ll not make
that mistake again.

35:41.878 --> 35:44.011
And I want my dog tags back!

35:44.098 --> 35:45.578
Those were supposed
to go to my mother.

35:45.665 --> 35:47.275
-You know what--
-Hey!

35:47.362 --> 35:49.147
You two knock it off.
We'’re not here for this.

35:49.234 --> 35:51.627
We'’re here to catch
dinosaurs.

35:51.714 --> 35:54.456
All right, listen up.

35:54.543 --> 35:56.719
Look for the chalk markings
on the buildings.

35:56.806 --> 36:00.158
X means trip wire,
O means motion sensor.

36:00.245 --> 36:01.594
Got you.

36:01.681 --> 36:03.117
Mind the X.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.916
I have a visual.

36:20.003 --> 36:21.440
Take the shot, Gordon.

36:21.527 --> 36:24.399
Aim for its neck.
Softer tissue.

36:24.486 --> 36:25.922
Don'’t kill it, sniper!

36:31.450 --> 36:33.713
Got it!

36:33.800 --> 36:35.671
Oh, please tell me you
used tranquilizer.

36:35.758 --> 36:37.978
That'’s a negative.
I used all my tranqs.

36:38.065 --> 36:41.024
Oh, God.
Status report now.

36:41.111 --> 36:42.548
On our way.

36:48.249 --> 36:49.990
They said the tranqs don'’t work.

36:50.077 --> 36:52.035
No. They said to shoot
it in the nose.

36:52.122 --> 36:53.863
Yeah.

36:53.950 --> 36:56.649
Maybe I can shoot through
the eye with a tranq?

36:56.736 --> 36:58.041
You should not get that close.

36:59.347 --> 37:02.220
How close is too close?

37:02.307 --> 37:04.744
I think my incident at the
garbage was a field test.

37:04.831 --> 37:05.745
You telling me
we don'’t know what it takes

37:05.832 --> 37:07.486
to take these down?

37:07.573 --> 37:11.141
I mean, it'’s not moving.
It'’s probably dead.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.318
Plug it a few times
just to be sure.

37:18.627 --> 37:19.846
What if it'’s playing dead?

37:19.933 --> 37:21.761
Would it do that?

37:23.589 --> 37:25.417
[ gunshots ]

37:25.504 --> 37:27.854
I'’m not sure
I want to get any closer.

37:27.941 --> 37:29.856
Not the time to get
cold feet, Deacon.

37:29.943 --> 37:31.597
We need to bag this thing
so we can go home.

37:32.989 --> 37:33.947
I'’m going in.

37:38.343 --> 37:39.779
[ roaring ]

37:39.866 --> 37:41.694
[ gunfire ]

37:41.781 --> 37:43.478
No!

37:49.049 --> 37:51.660
Deacon!
Stay with me, Deacon!

37:51.747 --> 37:53.271
Don'’t you leave me, Deacon!

37:54.881 --> 37:56.926
Ah!
I'’m out of tranqs!

38:01.583 --> 38:02.932
Go, go!

38:05.892 --> 38:08.024
[screaming]

38:08.111 --> 38:11.637
Deacon! No!
Deacon!

38:11.724 --> 38:13.639
Deacon!

38:13.726 --> 38:17.120
We have to leave him if we'’re
going to get them later.

38:21.211 --> 38:22.125
Damn it.

38:28.567 --> 38:30.612
It'’s V!

38:30.699 --> 38:34.529
The mercs are dropping and
they'’ve hardly made a dent.

38:34.616 --> 38:37.315
Yeah, it'’s happening faster
than I thought.

38:37.402 --> 38:38.751
She'’s ahead of schedule.

38:38.838 --> 38:40.492
Pick up the pace.

38:40.579 --> 38:43.016
Yeah, it means she'’s gonna
be much more angry

38:43.103 --> 38:44.670
and much more protective.

38:44.757 --> 38:48.108
All right.
Keep me informed. I gotta go.

38:48.195 --> 38:50.502
Will do. Bye.

38:54.244 --> 38:58.074
As you can see, we'’ve lost
our first mercenary.

38:58.161 --> 39:00.773
And the current bid,
$650 million.

39:00.860 --> 39:02.383
I hope you have
an underwriter for that.

39:04.864 --> 39:06.561
$700 million.

39:14.613 --> 39:16.354
What'’s going on?

39:16.441 --> 39:17.485
Nothing.

39:18.617 --> 39:19.531
What?

39:22.098 --> 39:24.231
Your team might
not have everything.

39:24.318 --> 39:25.537
What do you mean?

39:28.540 --> 39:30.063
I mean, there might
be a failsafe.

39:32.848 --> 39:34.241
Are you kidding me?

39:34.328 --> 39:36.025
It isn'’t guaranteed to work.

39:37.679 --> 39:39.594
What kind of failsafe?

39:39.681 --> 39:42.728
During the embryonic stage,
we implanted a microdot,

39:42.815 --> 39:46.514
of C4 activated by an
electronic receiver.

39:46.601 --> 39:48.777
C4, as in explosives?

39:48.864 --> 39:50.692
Right.

39:50.779 --> 39:51.693
Where?

39:51.780 --> 39:53.956
The brain.

39:54.043 --> 39:56.829
They have a bomb in the brain?

39:56.916 --> 39:58.918
Yes, but that was before
they had any real value.

39:59.005 --> 40:00.876
Now that we know
they can conceive,

40:00.963 --> 40:03.792
they'’re worth 10 times the
amount that was anticipated.

40:03.879 --> 40:06.360
And you were just told
to forget about this?

40:06.447 --> 40:08.144
Yes.

40:08.231 --> 40:09.842
Tell them, or we walk,

40:09.929 --> 40:11.800
and you bring in
someone else to clean up.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.673
Team?

40:14.760 --> 40:16.501
-Red Team, go.
-Blue Team, go.

40:16.588 --> 40:19.112
Simone needs to be told first.

40:19.199 --> 40:21.984
Told what first?

40:22.071 --> 40:25.727
When were you gonna tell me that
they have bombs in their brains?

40:25.814 --> 40:27.686
Hopefully, never.

40:27.773 --> 40:29.862
They need to know
there'’s a failsafe.

40:29.949 --> 40:31.994
That was put in
before we knew

40:32.081 --> 40:33.343
the potential of
these creatures.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.128
So?

40:35.215 --> 40:38.305
Unless absolutely necessary,
we don'’t tell them.

40:38.392 --> 40:41.656
It'’s too late.

40:41.743 --> 40:45.007
Copy that.
Bomb in the brain.

40:45.094 --> 40:47.401
Well, it doesn'’t matter.
We haven'’t tested it.

40:47.488 --> 40:49.316
We don'’t even know if it works.

40:49.403 --> 40:53.451
There is a password and radio
frequency as a last resort.

40:53.538 --> 40:57.455
But this is not it.
This is not the last resort.

40:57.542 --> 40:59.848
Now continue your sweep.

40:59.935 --> 41:01.676
Is there anything else
I need to know?

41:01.763 --> 41:04.200
You didn'’t even
need to know that.

41:04.287 --> 41:06.594
Screw you and your bank account.

41:08.378 --> 41:09.467
Give it to them.

41:14.689 --> 41:16.343
Team?

41:16.430 --> 41:18.388
Do it and you'’re fired.

41:18.476 --> 41:20.173
And you lose your shares, too.

41:22.392 --> 41:24.177
Give it to them.

41:24.264 --> 41:26.396
Everything I know
about you,

41:26.484 --> 41:28.529
everything you do,
everything you did...

41:28.616 --> 41:30.575
What is she talking about?

41:30.662 --> 41:33.186
Yeah. Elaine, why don'’t
you tell him?

41:33.273 --> 41:34.883
-Just tell him.
-Shut up.

41:34.970 --> 41:36.972
You'’re going to go to jail for
a very long time.

41:39.235 --> 41:40.498
Listen to me.

41:40.585 --> 41:43.718
I don'’t care what you'’ve done.

41:43.805 --> 41:46.547
If my people
come back alive,

41:46.634 --> 41:51.334
I guarantee
I will not betray you.

41:51.421 --> 41:53.598
If they die

41:53.685 --> 41:56.296
and those two creatures
running around free,

41:56.383 --> 42:00.082
there are thousands of
lives on the line.

42:00.169 --> 42:02.650
Help me help them.

42:12.268 --> 42:13.792
Listen up, team.

42:13.879 --> 42:15.794
The frequency to blow
the charges is

42:15.881 --> 42:20.276
165.91250.

42:23.802 --> 42:25.804
You just signed
your own prison sentence.

42:34.639 --> 42:36.554
91250!

42:36.641 --> 42:40.122
250.

42:40.209 --> 42:42.429
How do we use it?

42:42.516 --> 42:44.692
[shouts]

42:44.779 --> 42:46.389
Well, we don'’t have any way
to use in the field.

42:49.131 --> 42:53.135
But perhaps I hook up the sonic
gun to the radio tower.

42:53.222 --> 42:55.094
Yes, this I like.

42:55.181 --> 42:58.445
If I can discharge the weapon
in just the right frequency,

42:58.532 --> 43:01.491
ah, perhaps we set
off charges in their heads.

43:01.579 --> 43:02.841
You'’re a genius, Karl.

43:02.928 --> 43:03.885
Oh, I know.

43:03.972 --> 43:05.060
All right, let'’s do this.

43:05.147 --> 43:07.149
We think we have a solution.

43:07.236 --> 43:10.326
Karl can sync a sonic sidearm
to the nearest radio tower.

43:10.413 --> 43:12.459
He can then isolate
the frequency to match

43:12.546 --> 43:14.200
the detonator in
the dinosaurs'’ heads.

43:14.287 --> 43:16.202
All right.
Then let'’s do it.

43:16.289 --> 43:18.683
From now on,
this is not about retrieval.

43:18.770 --> 43:20.336
This is about survival.

43:20.423 --> 43:23.731
This is now
a search and destroy mission.

43:23.818 --> 43:26.995
Nothing has changed.
I want them back alive!

43:27.082 --> 43:28.562
They never agreed
to a suicide mission.

43:30.259 --> 43:31.521
You heard me.

43:31.609 --> 43:33.785
Use whatever means necessary.

43:33.872 --> 43:36.614
Copy that.

43:36.701 --> 43:37.615
Let'’s do this.

43:40.400 --> 43:41.488
For Deacon.

43:45.971 --> 43:47.233
For Deacon!

43:48.756 --> 43:49.714
For Deacs.

43:55.676 --> 43:56.938

44:13.781 --> 44:16.784
Well, they figured out
a way how to hurt them.

44:16.871 --> 44:19.613
One of them has a sonic gun.

44:19.700 --> 44:23.922
Yeah, they want to blow
the charges in their heads.

44:24.009 --> 44:25.967
Precautions should have
been taken for that!

44:26.054 --> 44:27.795
How did they find that out?

44:27.882 --> 44:29.579
Elaine gave them the code.

44:30.885 --> 44:33.496
This isn'’t good.

44:33.583 --> 44:36.412
All right,
I'’m going to add a randomizer.

44:36.499 --> 44:38.588
The frequency will change
every 15 minutes.

44:38.676 --> 44:39.764
I should have thought of that
in the beginning.

44:48.163 --> 44:49.382
[ roaring ]

44:59.609 --> 45:02.438
The sonic gun seems
to hurt them somewhat.

45:02.525 --> 45:04.484
Finally some good news.

45:04.571 --> 45:08.662
Well, not enough to kill them,
though, of course.

45:08.749 --> 45:10.359
Enough so they don'’t kill you.

45:35.558 --> 45:37.691
All'’s quiet up here.

45:37.778 --> 45:39.606

Nothing wrong with maintaining
the high ground

45:43.349 --> 45:44.872
while we make our next move.

45:44.959 --> 45:46.613
Have you done a clean sweep of
the area?

45:46.700 --> 45:48.833
Of course. Why?

45:50.704 --> 45:52.532
Stay frosty.

45:52.619 --> 45:54.316
There might be
someone else around.

I don'’t know. Janitor?
Security guard?

46:11.246 --> 46:12.770
I think they took
Deacon this way.

-What'’s that?

47:05.735 --> 47:08.695
It'’s Deacon'’s communicator.
It looks like it'’s up again.

And... look.

47:10.871 --> 47:12.090
It'’s tracking him.

Does that mean he'’s unarmed?

The circuitry is a mess.
Some of the wires are unplugged.

out and they'’re missing.

It means we made him smart, but
they exceeded our expectations.

57:36.496 --> 57:38.629
that they would learn
and adapt so quickly.

This.

57:46.898 --> 57:48.552
War, combat.

57:51.380 --> 57:53.557
They'’re intelligence grew
to the point where

57:53.644 --> 57:55.950
they started using
complex deception

57:56.037 --> 57:58.605
to herd the humans where
they wanted them.

57:58.692 --> 58:01.695
Those lucky enough to survive
the initial onslaught

58:01.782 --> 58:06.787
were faced with becoming prey
to a highly efficient predator,

58:06.874 --> 58:11.226
one without conscience,
morals or mercy.

58:11.313 --> 58:13.533
The dinosaurs adapted
so quickly,

58:13.620 --> 58:16.188
they became experts
at deception and manipulation

58:16.275 --> 58:18.190
almost instantly.

58:18.277 --> 58:21.672
In that facility, they became
the dominant species.

58:21.759 --> 58:23.543
The same thing happened when
I tracked it to Deacon.

58:23.630 --> 58:25.980
It'’s like they wanted us
to go there.

58:26.067 --> 58:27.591
It'’s known where we are gonna go

58:27.678 --> 58:32.117
or it'’s taken us
where they want us to go.

58:32.204 --> 58:34.293
Or where they didn'’t
want us to go.

58:34.380 --> 58:36.077
There'’s more.

58:36.164 --> 58:39.777
During the process, the amygdala
ended up growing too.

58:39.864 --> 58:42.040
What does that mean?

58:42.127 --> 58:43.781
It means their fight
or flight response

58:43.868 --> 58:45.434
is greater than a human'’s.

58:45.522 --> 58:46.435
Yeah.

58:48.960 --> 58:50.701
Karl, how close are you?

58:50.788 --> 58:54.443
I am close.
[ chuckles ]

58:54.531 --> 58:56.141
Another minute or two, please.

58:56.228 --> 59:01.929
[phone rings]

59:02.016 --> 59:04.149
What the hell is going on?

59:04.236 --> 59:06.978
Are those mercenaries dead yet? Give me an update!

59:07.065 --> 59:08.980
What the hell is taking so long?

59:09.067 --> 59:11.678
You told me these dinosaurs were
gonna wipe '’em out in no time!

59:11.765 --> 59:12.723
Pick up the pace!

59:16.030 --> 59:17.118
No.

59:19.294 --> 59:20.861
Who is this?

59:20.948 --> 59:22.646
Talk.

59:22.733 --> 59:26.563
Ah, so you'’re the clever one.

59:26.650 --> 59:29.391
These are not just genetically
enhanced dinosaurs.

59:29.478 --> 59:32.220
They'’ve been bred
to be superior soldiers.

59:32.307 --> 59:34.614
And now they can
breed on their own.

59:34.701 --> 59:37.095
When we increased
their intelligence,

59:37.182 --> 59:39.227
they learned to respond
and to react

59:39.314 --> 59:41.665
to the most complex
battlefield scenarios.

59:41.752 --> 59:45.146
Maybe they'’ve become
more aggressive.

59:45.233 --> 59:47.845
All of the strengths of
a lab-developed allosaurus,

59:47.932 --> 59:50.891
but with none of psychological
problems, or so we hoped.

59:54.982 --> 59:57.681
How many laws have you
broken doing all this?

59:57.768 --> 1:00:00.422
Laws?
[ chuckles ]

1:00:00.509 --> 1:00:02.381
People at my level
are not subject

1:00:02.468 --> 1:00:03.774
to the laws of government.

1:00:03.861 --> 1:00:05.427
Now you and your associates,

1:00:05.514 --> 1:00:08.430
well, that'’s a completely
different story.

1:00:10.389 --> 1:00:12.217
Is this true?

1:00:12.304 --> 1:00:13.958
No.

1:00:14.045 --> 1:00:15.742
I'’m worse than both of them.

1:00:15.829 --> 1:00:17.701
They'’re just the money.
They broker the deals.

1:00:17.788 --> 1:00:19.311
I made the actual weapons.

1:00:19.398 --> 1:00:21.139
You knew about all this.

1:00:21.226 --> 1:00:23.228
You'’ve seen this.

1:00:23.315 --> 1:00:27.841
All this time,
I thought it was you.

1:00:29.538 --> 1:00:32.629
You'’re just a suit.

1:00:32.716 --> 1:00:35.588
You'’re a scientist.

1:00:36.676 --> 1:00:38.156
This is your work.

1:00:38.243 --> 1:00:40.462
You have no idea.
This is my life'’s work!

1:00:40.549 --> 1:00:43.640
You think I give
a damn about them? Please.

1:00:43.727 --> 1:00:46.294
So we'’ve all been expendable.
This was all your plan.

1:00:46.381 --> 1:00:48.470
No. Not for me.
This was not my plan!

1:00:50.472 --> 1:00:53.998
None of your plans have worked
today, but yours have.

1:00:54.085 --> 1:00:56.609
What are you talking about?

1:00:56.696 --> 1:00:58.916
That phone call.

1:00:59.003 --> 1:01:03.398
We were all the field test
for your weapons!

1:01:03.485 --> 1:01:05.879
Wait. What do you mean
we'’re the field test?

1:01:05.966 --> 1:01:08.447
We were only called in because
the transport went sour.

1:01:10.623 --> 1:01:13.452
I found this after
the truck crashed

1:01:17.717 --> 1:01:20.633
and I thought it was Harrison'’s.

1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:23.897
But he wouldn'’t carry any
thing like this.

1:01:23.984 --> 1:01:25.116
He'’s never dealt
with explosives.

1:01:25.203 --> 1:01:27.031
What is it?

1:01:27.118 --> 1:01:31.252
This is what is left if a small
receiver for an explosion.

1:01:33.820 --> 1:01:39.086
You blew up their cages and
you didn'’t even sedate them.

1:01:39.173 --> 1:01:42.089
Would you send your soldiers
into battle sedated?

1:01:42.176 --> 1:01:43.090
You son of a--

1:01:43.177 --> 1:01:44.657
Sit down!

1:01:44.744 --> 1:01:46.833
You'’ve got plenty
of blood on your hands.

1:01:48.443 --> 1:01:50.141
You knew about all this.

1:01:50.228 --> 1:01:52.709
This industrial park?
This is all yours.

1:01:52.796 --> 1:01:55.624
Simone: Yep, we own it.

1:01:55.712 --> 1:01:57.061
This is all by design.

1:02:01.500 --> 1:02:03.197
But what if it didn'’t fail?

1:02:03.284 --> 1:02:05.547
What if you actually
succeeded doing all this?

1:02:05.634 --> 1:02:07.071
It wasn'’t part of the plan.

1:02:07.158 --> 1:02:08.899
You were always the B team.

1:02:08.986 --> 1:02:12.380
What does that mean?

1:02:12.467 --> 1:02:14.252
It means we were never supposed to walk out of here.

1:02:14.339 --> 1:02:17.995
I'’m guessing a
drone strike?

1:02:18.082 --> 1:02:20.737
We used the same tactic on
a decoy mission in Beirut.

1:02:20.824 --> 1:02:22.434
It didn'’t work out then.

1:02:22.521 --> 1:02:24.653
At this point,
we need to finish the job,

1:02:24.741 --> 1:02:26.699
or none of us
walks away from here alive.

1:02:26.786 --> 1:02:28.701
I have to check on something.

1:02:28.788 --> 1:02:31.791
Those dinosaurs could have
easily torn us out of that van.

1:02:31.878 --> 1:02:33.401
I want to know why they didn'’t.

1:02:34.576 --> 1:02:36.317
I get it now.

1:02:36.404 --> 1:02:38.276
It'’s where they don'’t
want us to be.

1:02:38.363 --> 1:02:41.105
-Nick, where are you going?
-Are you out of your mind?

1:02:59.601 --> 1:03:02.256
Gordon, you got two rounds left?
I need cover.

1:03:02.343 --> 1:03:04.693
Copy that.

1:03:04.781 --> 1:03:06.521
You'’re crazy to be
out there, amigo.

1:03:06.608 --> 1:03:07.696
Copy that.

[ roaring ]

1:03:45.473 --> 1:03:46.735

1:03:53.612 --> 1:03:56.093
The dinosaurs were listening.

1:03:56.180 --> 1:03:58.747
They have Deacon'’s comm unit.

1:03:58.835 --> 1:04:00.532
They heard everything
we were saying.

1:04:00.619 --> 1:04:03.361
They know where we were
because we told them.

1:04:05.319 --> 1:04:06.886
That'’s why I thought
Deacon was alive.

1:04:08.409 --> 1:04:11.369
His comm wasn'’t even
near his body.

1:04:11.456 --> 1:04:14.067
They turned it on
to lure us to him.

1:04:14.154 --> 1:04:16.635
This is better than
I could have ever imagined.

1:04:16.722 --> 1:04:18.506
They can understand us?

1:04:26.297 --> 1:04:28.690
[laughs]

1:04:28.777 --> 1:04:30.475
I think I have it!

1:04:30.562 --> 1:04:31.911
Good, light it up.

1:04:36.350 --> 1:04:37.221
The dinosaurs are on the move.

1:04:38.962 --> 1:04:39.876

a few minutes

1:04:53.324 --> 1:04:55.500
to reach maximum voltage.

1:04:55.587 --> 1:04:58.982
Copy that.
Keep us posted.

1:04:59.069 --> 1:05:00.505
[roaring]

1:05:07.512 --> 1:05:08.774
They'’re here.

1:05:39.761 --> 1:05:41.328
Don'’t blow the dinosaurs!

1:05:41.415 --> 1:05:42.808
I repeat, don'’t blow the C4!

1:05:42.895 --> 1:05:44.592
Why not?

1:05:44.679 --> 1:05:46.333
Do you even know
what'’s in these buildings?

1:05:46.420 --> 1:05:48.292
No. What?

1:05:48.379 --> 1:05:49.946
Ammonia Nitrate!

1:05:50.033 --> 1:05:52.035
It'’s the same stuff that
blew the hole in Beirut!

1:05:52.122 --> 1:05:54.385
If you blow the C4,
it will activate the chemical

1:05:54.472 --> 1:05:56.256
and blow up half the state!

1:05:56.343 --> 1:05:58.476
Did you know about this?

1:05:58.563 --> 1:06:00.304
No.

1:06:00.391 --> 1:06:01.435
Karl, abort!

1:06:02.567 --> 1:06:03.437
Karl, abort!

1:06:06.223 --> 1:06:07.964
It was a pleasure
working with all of you.

1:06:11.880 --> 1:06:14.883
Karl, come in!

1:06:14.971 --> 1:06:17.930
Did he turn it off?

1:06:18.017 --> 1:06:20.367
Unsure.

1:06:20.454 --> 1:06:21.542
I'’ll go check it out!

1:06:23.153 --> 1:06:24.458
Wait, wait,
no, no, no, no, no!

1:06:24.545 --> 1:06:26.417
What is it?

1:06:26.504 --> 1:06:28.636
The Oxen Valley plant.
It'’s only five miles from here.

1:06:28.723 --> 1:06:29.768
It'’s in the blast zone.

1:06:29.855 --> 1:06:31.074
Oxen Valley?

1:06:31.161 --> 1:06:32.205
It'’s a nuclear power plant.

1:06:32.292 --> 1:06:33.902
Jeez.

1:06:33.990 --> 1:06:36.035
Somebody has to get up there
and stop that signal

1:06:36.122 --> 1:06:37.776
before it blows
and kills us all!

1:06:37.863 --> 1:06:39.343

Gordon, I need you
to watch my six.

1:06:47.133 --> 1:06:48.830
They'’re not far behind.

almost at 90%!

1:07:14.639 --> 1:07:16.293
You need to get there now!

1:07:16.380 --> 1:07:17.598
ELAINE: I'’m looking for
a remote override.

seem to be in pursuit.

1:07:21.646 --> 1:07:23.865

1:07:37.314 --> 1:07:39.055
Karl'’s dead.

1:07:39.142 --> 1:07:40.795
One of them got him.

1:07:40.882 --> 1:07:43.189
What about the one on your six?

1:07:43.276 --> 1:07:45.452
It retreated back
towards the van.

1:07:45.539 --> 1:07:47.280
We got lucky with this one.

1:07:47.367 --> 1:07:50.762
But I don'’t think
Karl messed up.

1:07:50.849 --> 1:07:52.024
What do you mean?

1:07:53.721 --> 1:07:55.462
I mean, the setup is perfect.

1:07:55.549 --> 1:07:57.638
There'’s no reason why
it shouldn'’t have worked.

1:07:57.725 --> 1:07:59.379
We should all be dead right now.

1:08:01.773 --> 1:08:04.776
The sun is gonna set
in less than an hour.

1:08:04.863 --> 1:08:06.517
We need a new plan.

1:08:09.346 --> 1:08:11.478
We have another mercenary down.

1:08:14.002 --> 1:08:16.744
The current bid
is $750 million

1:08:16.831 --> 1:08:19.486
to an undisclosed
African nation.

1:08:19.573 --> 1:08:21.793
$775!

1:08:21.880 --> 1:08:24.274
Of course, we can deliver
within the year.

1:08:25.405 --> 1:08:26.276

You couldn'’t wait?

1:08:35.198 --> 1:08:36.895
Contingency?

1:08:36.982 --> 1:08:38.897
What is this?

1:08:38.984 --> 1:08:41.465
You don'’t understand.

1:08:41.552 --> 1:08:43.336
You and I don'’t matter.

1:08:44.642 --> 1:08:47.079
There'’s too much at stake.

1:08:47.166 --> 1:08:49.473
The dinosaurs must survive.

1:08:49.560 --> 1:08:50.735
What did you do?

1:08:50.822 --> 1:08:52.432
Drone strike.

1:08:52.519 --> 1:08:54.130
To take out the dinosaurs?

1:08:54.217 --> 1:08:56.828
No. Us.

1:08:58.308 --> 1:08:59.787
This just gets better
and better.

1:09:02.442 --> 1:09:06.272

will be solved in the van.

1:09:06.359 --> 1:09:07.882
Can you get there?

1:09:07.969 --> 1:09:11.538
To the van? Yeah.
What am I looking for?

1:09:11.625 --> 1:09:14.498
We were in the van
they didn'’t attack us

1:09:14.585 --> 1:09:17.631
because they hid
their egg in the van.

1:09:17.718 --> 1:09:22.462
Joy, I want you in and out of
there as fast as possible!

1:09:22.549 --> 1:09:24.421

have been one step ahead of us

1:09:24.508 --> 1:09:27.598
