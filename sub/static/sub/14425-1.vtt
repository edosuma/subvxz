EASY SEX, SAD MOVIES

02:26.501 --> 02:30.001
This is lovely, isn't it?

02:46.709 --> 02:48.584
- Will we hear them?
- What?

02:48.709 --> 02:50.042
The chimes.

02:54.501 --> 02:55.584
I don't know.

02:56.876 --> 02:59.542
I've always seen it at home,
on the TV.

03:03.376 --> 03:06.292
<i>It's gone 11:40 already.</i>

03:06.459 --> 03:09.876
<i>Less than 17 minutes to go,
we can see it on the clock</i>

03:10.042 --> 03:12.042
<i>that our cameras
are showing us</i>

03:12.209 --> 03:15.292
<i>from the mobile unit
down in the square.</i>

03:15.459 --> 03:18.001
<i>- Once again, the square is packed...
- It's incredible!</i>

03:30.584 --> 03:34.667
GALAXY STORES WISHES YOU
A MERRY CHRISTMAS

04:07.292 --> 04:09.292
- I'm leaving.
- What?

04:10.084 --> 04:12.542
- I'm sorry, I have to go.
- Victor. Victor!

04:14.334 --> 04:17.041
<i>The last scene of a romantic comedy</i>

04:17.209 --> 04:19.209
<i>is always
the easiest to write.</i>

04:19.875 --> 04:22.959
<i>A great declaration of love
in which the two protagonists</i>

04:23.126 --> 04:25.792
<i>manage to overcome
all the obstacles</i>

04:25.917 --> 04:28.334
<i>and decide
to be together forever.</i>

04:29.501 --> 04:32.084
<i>Then comes the kiss, logically.</i>

04:32.292 --> 04:33.917
<i>That's essential.</i>

04:34.709 --> 04:37.417
<i>The start of the story
isn't too complicated either:</i>

04:37.584 --> 04:42.084
<i>in a bookstore like those
that always appear in romantic comedies.</i>

04:42.292 --> 04:45.334
<i>Marina and Victor
could meet in that place.</i>

04:47.292 --> 04:49.001
<i>In any romantic comedy,
the hero</i>

04:49.167 --> 04:53.001
<i>always has a friend,
fatter or shyer than he is,</i>

04:53.126 --> 04:54.876
<i>in whom he confides.</i>

04:55.001 --> 04:56.751
- You're not helping me.
- Yes, I am.

04:56.917 --> 04:59.167
What I'm not doing
is fuelling the drama.

04:59.376 --> 05:01.626
God, I'd really love
some new friends.

05:01.792 --> 05:04.459
<i>The heroine
must have a friend too,</i>

05:04.626 --> 05:08.292
<i>someone who always has
very difficult love affairs</i>

05:08.459 --> 05:10.501
<i>and seems unable
to talk about anything else.</i>

05:10.667 --> 05:14.167
The thing doesn't last
more than 5 or 7 minutes. Amazing!

05:14.376 --> 05:17.626
Suddenly he does this to me...
A signal for me to go!

05:19.667 --> 05:22.376
<i>And it wouldn't be unusual
that in a romantic comedy</i>

05:22.542 --> 05:25.459
<i>the protagonists' friends
end up falling in love...</i>

05:26.209 --> 05:28.709
<i>and their wedding
could be the perfect excuse</i>

05:28.876 --> 05:30.501
<i>for Victor and Marina
to meet again</i>

05:30.667 --> 05:32.709
<i>after being apart for a while.</i>

05:34.917 --> 05:37.709
<i>Those are the essential moments
in the story.</i>

05:38.876 --> 05:40.459
<i>Now...</i>

05:41.376 --> 05:43.292
<i>I just have to write it.</i>

06:07.042 --> 06:09.584
Your teeth will fall out
if you brush like that.

06:18.959 --> 06:20.584
Scalp massage?

06:21.917 --> 06:24.251
Why not use the helmet
I gave you?

06:34.126 --> 06:35.459
Are you having a shower?

06:37.042 --> 06:39.834
- You could've got up earlier.
- Oh, please...

06:40.001 --> 06:41.542
Well, hurry up.

06:41.709 --> 06:44.834
I was throwing up all night.
I feel awful.

06:45.792 --> 06:47.959
I'm not pregnant,
don't worry.

06:48.542 --> 06:51.001
It must have been
that shit we ate last night.

06:52.042 --> 06:53.584
Why didn't you tell me?

06:53.751 --> 06:54.917
What for?

06:57.459 --> 07:00.501
I don't know, I've got no idea.
I lost it.

07:00.667 --> 07:02.542
Did you call the camera guys?

07:02.709 --> 07:06.709
Don't tell him you're calling for me,
I owe him a fortune.

07:07.667 --> 07:09.959
OK, love, a big kiss.

07:10.584 --> 07:12.459
I don't know where I left mine.

07:12.626 --> 07:15.459
- "Love"? Who was that?
- Didn't I tell you?

07:15.584 --> 07:17.376
She's worked with me for ages.

07:17.501 --> 07:19.751
Don't come crying to me afterwards.
I know you.

07:19.917 --> 07:22.834
- Or have an eighth child...
- No, the ninth.

07:23.001 --> 07:24.917
Claudita, the one I had
with the Brazilian girl.

07:25.084 --> 07:26.834
I lived in Madrid for ages.

07:27.001 --> 07:30.667
I know the city, how they talk,
everything. Don't worry about that.

07:30.834 --> 07:32.959
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, yes.

07:33.126 --> 07:36.209
It has to be light-hearted,
people don't want to be depressed.

07:36.417 --> 07:39.834
And the city has to look
like Paris, New York... Wait!

07:40.001 --> 07:40.959
- Here.
- Thanks.

07:41.126 --> 07:42.876
This is the advance.

07:44.126 --> 07:47.417
Any time now
I'll give you the rest.

07:47.542 --> 07:49.292
- "Any time now"?
- Are you hard up?

07:49.459 --> 07:52.626
No, but "without a fish,
the seal doesn't clap", Andrés.

07:52.792 --> 07:56.001
- Don't you like what I gave you?
- Yes, it's fine. It's work.

07:57.084 --> 07:59.126
- Are you writing anything?
- Something.

07:59.334 --> 08:01.459
Maybe you'll finish it some day.

08:02.584 --> 08:04.959
Come on, don't get annoyed.

08:05.126 --> 08:07.667
And stop worrying
about money because

08:07.834 --> 08:10.792
a guy wants to bring a group
to buy the production company.

08:10.959 --> 08:14.542
He's Turkish. He's not going
to get involved, or...

08:14.667 --> 08:17.126
- do anything.
- That's good.

08:17.334 --> 08:19.667
- Have you got Spanish citizenship?
- No.

08:19.834 --> 08:21.667
- Why not?
- They never gave it to me.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.334
It has to be a co-production.

08:23.501 --> 08:25.792
We have to contract
Argentinean actors,

08:25.959 --> 08:28.042
- Spanish actors...
- That's fine.

08:28.209 --> 08:31.334
For the Argentinians, we can
talk to Daniel and to Peretti.

08:31.501 --> 08:33.208
The Spanish love them.

08:33.667 --> 08:36.126
- When will you finish the script?
- Any time now.

08:36.333 --> 08:37.708
As soon as you can, hurry up.

08:37.833 --> 08:40.501
It's a romantic comedy.
It shouldn't be hard.

08:51.292 --> 08:54.417
INTERIOR. BOOKSTORE. DAY

09:06.376 --> 09:07.542
<i>Valeria!</i>

09:12.584 --> 09:13.792
Valeria!

09:23.167 --> 09:27.167
- Can't you stop?
- No, I can't. Don't you see?

09:28.084 --> 09:29.501
Carry on.

09:29.917 --> 09:32.292
Use a gentler touch.

09:33.876 --> 09:36.209
It's 15 minutes over the hour.

09:54.084 --> 09:56.376
- I teach a kids' dance class.
- That's neat.

09:56.542 --> 09:58.626
Yeah, but I'm hoping
for something better.

09:58.792 --> 09:59.501
Of course.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.167
- What do you do?
- Web sites.

10:01.376 --> 10:03.167
- I'm a designer.
- That's great!

10:03.376 --> 10:06.459
All day in front of a computer.
A bit of a pain, but it's not bad.

10:06.626 --> 10:10.042
- My car's over there.
- I live near here, I can walk.

10:10.167 --> 10:13.459
- But we can have one more.
- I have to dance tomorrow.

10:13.709 --> 10:16.626
- You have my number, right?
- Yes, but, not even one more?

10:16.959 --> 10:18.459
One can't harm you.

10:19.459 --> 10:21.459
Yeah, but not tonight.

10:22.292 --> 10:24.084
That's because you don't know me.

10:24.959 --> 10:26.584
I'm Victor Montero,
32 years old.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.834
At 5, I broke this finger
and bent it forever.

10:29.001 --> 10:32.209
My brother sells cars in Germany.
My parents live in Barcelona.

10:32.417 --> 10:35.626
Every Sunday they eat paella.
They like it. You know what I like?

10:35.792 --> 10:38.292
Gin and tonic.
Another thing we have in common.

10:38.626 --> 10:41.334
If you want to know
anything else about me,

10:41.501 --> 10:42.667
you'll find out later.

10:46.501 --> 10:47.501
What a pity.

10:48.459 --> 10:49.834
You were doing really well.

10:56.292 --> 10:58.334
<i>Yes, you're a dickhead.</i>

10:58.792 --> 11:00.667
It's no big deal.

11:00.834 --> 11:03.417
I was pleasant, but it didn't work.
It's OK.

11:03.584 --> 11:06.417
You can't force relationships.
You know why?

11:06.584 --> 11:09.876
One day you get up and,
somehow, you have a girlfriend.

11:10.334 --> 11:11.876
At first,
we get on really well.

11:12.042 --> 11:13.959
We screw every day,
we try weird positions.

11:14.126 --> 11:16.334
We do it in the park,
the supermarket. The usual.

11:16.501 --> 11:19.542
After 6 months, one says:
"Why pay two rents?"

11:19.709 --> 11:21.959
"Why pay more?
Let's live together."

11:22.126 --> 11:23.501
And you fall for it.

11:23.667 --> 11:26.084
A year later, your girlfriend
has become your roommate.

11:26.251 --> 11:28.834
You're dying to screw, yes.
With everyone except her.

11:29.001 --> 11:31.626
You don't want to hear her problems,
she complicates your life...

11:31.792 --> 11:34.459
- Stop, stop.
- You hang on another six months.

11:34.626 --> 11:37.334
Then you separate and you've lost
18 months. For forcing things.

11:37.459 --> 11:39.167
Why are you so scared
to fall in love?

11:39.334 --> 11:42.709
- I'm not scared.
- Do you know what I'd give to...

11:42.876 --> 11:45.251
Shit, and as well, with a dancer.

11:47.376 --> 11:50.459
Look, call her. That way,
you see her at least once more.

11:50.876 --> 11:54.417
We'll go see her dance one day.
Maybe she has a friend for me.

11:55.167 --> 11:58.709
We might fall in love.
If I have kids with her best friend

11:58.876 --> 12:02.084
my kids will play with yours.
We'd collect them from school.

12:02.251 --> 12:04.251
- Yeah, sure.
- In my Audi.

12:04.459 --> 12:06.084
On Sundays you'd all come
to our house.

12:13.542 --> 12:17.042
Well, I've got your essays.

12:17.917 --> 12:19.751
Weak, guys, eh?

12:20.126 --> 12:22.501
Anyone who didn't read
the classics is just lazy.

12:23.126 --> 12:25.834
Well, a few are good.
Who is...

12:26.001 --> 12:28.959
- Camila...?
- Kander?

12:29.292 --> 12:30.876
Me.

12:33.459 --> 12:36.876
- Hello.
- I was delighted about the essay.

12:37.042 --> 12:39.667
- It's very good.
- I'm so proud that you say that.

12:39.834 --> 12:43.209
In High School, I always read
Pablo Diuk's columns.

12:43.417 --> 12:45.584
My friends and I would wait
for Fridays to read them.

12:45.751 --> 12:48.417
They were great.
Why did you stop?

12:48.542 --> 12:51.042
It was a supplement
for young people...

12:51.209 --> 12:54.709
Right. And I loved your novel.
It really affected me.

12:54.876 --> 12:56.917
The characters, the dialogue...

12:57.084 --> 13:00.126
Are you writing now?
You haven't published in ages.

13:00.709 --> 13:04.042
- Yes, various things.
- That's good.

13:04.209 --> 13:07.751
Different things in different areas.
A movie script too.

13:07.917 --> 13:09.501
That's really good.

13:10.001 --> 13:12.001
Well, it's more of an assignment.

13:12.167 --> 13:15.209
I'm doing a favor for a friend,
a producer.

13:15.626 --> 13:17.001
- Well...
- Well...

13:17.167 --> 13:19.709
At least you'll be able
to change your car.

13:19.876 --> 13:21.751
Yes. Where are you going?

13:22.667 --> 13:25.126
- To Colegiales.
- If you want... It's on my way.

13:25.334 --> 13:26.834
It is? Great.

13:32.126 --> 13:35.334
- I studied cinema too.
- Excuse me, Cristina, put on...

13:35.917 --> 13:37.126
Camila.

13:37.334 --> 13:40.876
Actually, I studied
a load of other things too, but...

13:41.042 --> 13:42.709
I gave them all up.

13:42.834 --> 13:45.084
And I'm going
to give this one up too,

13:45.376 --> 13:48.084
I want to live abroad
and do other things.

13:48.292 --> 13:49.959
I might make a movie first.

13:50.126 --> 13:52.209
- That's good.
- Yes, next year.

13:52.459 --> 13:55.459
I want to show the life
of the super in my building.

13:56.042 --> 13:59.334
A guy who sits there quietly
watching people passing by,

13:59.501 --> 14:00.959
hurrying, coming and going...

14:01.126 --> 14:03.959
Everyone is so busy
and he is just

14:04.126 --> 14:06.001
sitting there, quietly,

14:06.167 --> 14:07.792
as if he were a buddha.

14:07.917 --> 14:10.792
Yes, yes, like a totem.

14:11.334 --> 14:13.126
Yes, something like that.

14:23.126 --> 14:24.167
Well...

14:25.417 --> 14:26.584
Well...

14:27.542 --> 14:29.167
Let me make you some tea.

14:29.376 --> 14:31.751
I don't take coffee,
It gives me a headache.

14:32.209 --> 14:34.501
Come on, and you can
sign your novel for me.

14:36.459 --> 14:37.584
You still have it?

14:37.876 --> 14:40.126
I told you I'm a big fan.

14:53.751 --> 14:56.959
Your class was exhausting.
I love them, but...

14:57.126 --> 14:58.584
- Yes, intense.
- Yes.

14:59.126 --> 15:00.584
I'm dying for a joint.

15:02.001 --> 15:02.917
Will you roll it?

15:03.959 --> 15:05.042
I'm peeing myself.

15:11.667 --> 15:13.042
You want to watch?

17:07.584 --> 17:09.166
Fuck, this is paradise.

17:09.751 --> 17:11.541
Just as well
I insisted you come.

17:11.709 --> 17:13.916
You were on the phone
the whole time.

17:14.084 --> 17:16.209
It was just for a minute.

17:16.666 --> 17:19.041
It's full of hot girls and faggots.

17:19.541 --> 17:21.751
We're going to get interested
in dancing.

17:21.916 --> 17:24.416
We'll get a season ticket
or whatever.

17:24.791 --> 17:26.084
We'll come more often.

17:27.834 --> 17:29.917
I really liked
the one who did the splits.

17:30.084 --> 17:31.126
Yeah?

17:31.334 --> 17:33.376
You know what you can do
with a girl like that?

17:33.501 --> 17:35.334
A lot of things.

17:35.501 --> 17:37.834
Don't laugh, I fall in love
over silly things.

17:38.001 --> 17:40.251
- I know, for your lifetime.
- For my lifetime.

17:41.042 --> 17:42.334
- Victor.
- Hello.

17:42.501 --> 17:43.667
This is a surprise

17:45.126 --> 17:46.501
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?

17:47.001 --> 17:48.084
Great.

17:48.417 --> 17:51.167
Well... I loved it.

17:51.667 --> 17:53.584
- You did?
- Seriously.

17:53.751 --> 17:56.209
When you danced,
it was as if...

17:56.542 --> 17:57.959
you were kind of floating.

17:58.334 --> 18:00.126
And then,
I don't really understand this...

18:00.334 --> 18:03.709
You moved a hand or a foot
and I felt all sorts of things.

18:04.042 --> 18:06.084
Really, you're incredible, I mean it.

18:06.792 --> 18:07.876
That's great.

18:08.042 --> 18:09.917
It knocked me out a bit.

18:11.751 --> 18:12.626
Thank you.

18:12.792 --> 18:13.501
Hi!

18:14.417 --> 18:17.126
- Hello.
- This is Luis, he's a friend of mine.

18:17.542 --> 18:18.917
- You were great.
- Thank you.

18:19.084 --> 18:21.584
- We're going for a beer.
- OK. This is Victor...

18:21.709 --> 18:22.834
Hello.

18:23.001 --> 18:24.667
- And you're...
- Luis.

18:24.834 --> 18:26.709
I've just set up your fan club.

18:28.376 --> 18:30.417
- Thank you.
- I'm serious.

18:30.584 --> 18:32.209
Well, I'm Clara.

18:33.542 --> 18:36.667
- What'll we do? Let's...
- We're going for a beer. Want to come?

18:36.834 --> 18:38.167
- Sure.
- That's great.

18:38.376 --> 18:40.376
- Did you tell the others?
- Yes.

18:42.042 --> 18:43.334
What tonic do you have?

18:43.501 --> 18:44.959
OK, let the ice cubes chill it.

18:45.126 --> 18:46.792
Then take those out
and put in fresh ones.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.459
One quarter of gin, three of tonic.
What ice cubes do you have?

18:49.751 --> 18:51.334
OK, two of those.

18:51.876 --> 18:52.917
What do you want?

18:53.376 --> 18:54.667
I'll have the same.

18:55.167 --> 18:57.376
If the tonic is cold from the start,
it has no taste.

18:57.542 --> 18:59.542
And with more than three ice cubes,
it's too watery.

18:59.709 --> 19:01.376
All right. And one question:

19:01.542 --> 19:04.626
after you have 4 or 5,
do you still notice all that?

19:04.792 --> 19:06.501
I never drink more than two.

19:11.292 --> 19:12.334
Five points.

19:13.792 --> 19:16.376
Four. He forgot to remove
the lemon pips.

19:19.584 --> 19:20.584
How are you?

19:21.751 --> 19:23.792
- Very well, and you?
- I'm well.

19:32.376 --> 19:35.417
I'm... half dating someone.

19:36.626 --> 19:38.417
Best to clarify things now, isn't it?

19:39.001 --> 19:41.459
Yes, of course. It's much better.

19:43.917 --> 19:45.376
We can...

19:49.209 --> 19:51.792
I don't really believe in friendship
in these cases.

19:51.917 --> 19:54.334
I think... it doesn't work.

19:55.709 --> 19:57.917
I agree.
I don't know why I said it.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.584
Something we have in common.

20:06.209 --> 20:08.334
I loved "Flashdance" when I was a kid.

20:08.501 --> 20:10.834
- What?
- I learned all the choreography.

20:11.167 --> 20:14.751
As soon as any neighbors
or relatives came to the house,

20:14.917 --> 20:17.126
I'd put a band on my hair
and start dancing.

20:17.334 --> 20:20.834
And I wasn't bad. I think
I'd have been a great dancer, but...

20:21.001 --> 20:24.334
- my parents didn't support me.
- That's adorable!

20:24.501 --> 20:27.834
- You could start dancing again.
- I haven't ruled it out.

20:28.126 --> 20:31.834
Taxi!
I think I'm leaving now.

20:36.584 --> 20:39.376
Hey, weren't you and I
going the same way?

20:40.501 --> 20:43.501
- Yes! We'll talk.
- OK.

20:45.876 --> 20:47.084
Your poor friend.

20:47.209 --> 20:50.459
- No, your poor friend.
- No, no, your poor friend.

20:53.292 --> 20:54.751
How long has it been?

20:56.042 --> 20:57.417
With that guy.

20:59.626 --> 21:01.292
A week, six days.

21:02.167 --> 21:03.834
Six days?

21:04.001 --> 21:06.167
Yes. I see things
or I don't see them,

21:06.376 --> 21:08.417
And with him... I saw it.

21:10.667 --> 21:12.834
Don't you imagine things?

21:14.042 --> 21:17.459
Yes, at times, but in general
I prefer living in reality.

21:18.542 --> 21:21.167
I don't,
I need to imagine things.

21:22.751 --> 21:26.334
How can you always live in reality,
without imagining anything?

21:26.501 --> 21:28.959
Do you ever surprise anyone
with anything?

21:30.001 --> 21:33.167
Sometimes.
Sometimes I do imagine.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.834
I'm going that way.

21:37.542 --> 21:38.626
OK.

21:39.501 --> 21:41.584
But we'll talk, OK?

21:45.167 --> 21:46.251
Victor.

21:48.459 --> 21:49.709
Thanks for coming.

22:18.417 --> 22:20.626
OK, but when do they kiss?

22:20.917 --> 22:22.626
That'll take a while, Andrés.

22:22.917 --> 22:26.042
It can't be so easy,
so... immediate.

22:26.209 --> 22:28.417
Really?

22:28.667 --> 22:30.001
Well, you know best.

22:32.459 --> 22:34.542
What are you taking?
Are you all right?

22:35.084 --> 22:36.959
Yes, I'll tell you now.

22:38.959 --> 22:42.626
I take it because after the second
whiskey my pressure goes up.

22:42.792 --> 22:45.917
170, 180.
This brings it down a bit.

22:46.542 --> 22:49.626
They changed the medication.
I was taking one and I never came.

22:49.792 --> 22:52.042
I was screwing and screwing
and I never came.

22:52.209 --> 22:53.917
So your girlfriend's happy.

22:54.584 --> 22:57.084
You don't know all I do
to keep in shape,

22:57.251 --> 23:00.001
so I can be
with someone young.

23:00.167 --> 23:02.084
And I still get a hard on.

23:02.459 --> 23:04.751
- I don't use Viagra, they forbade it.
- Without it.

23:04.917 --> 23:06.167
Yes.
You want another?

23:06.376 --> 23:08.917
Wait a minute, Andrés.
Are you sure you can?

23:19.792 --> 23:22.167
Look, 130-80.

23:22.751 --> 23:26.376
I'm fighting fit. And the truth is,
I know that everything

23:26.542 --> 23:28.084
is up here.

23:29.167 --> 23:30.084
I'm not well.

23:32.459 --> 23:34.501
- What's wrong?
- Adriana.

23:34.667 --> 23:37.542
I feel that
she's not committed

23:37.667 --> 23:40.376
to the relationship. She's not...

23:40.542 --> 23:42.876
- I see.
- She's... not there...

23:43.042 --> 23:46.917
I feel that she's always uncertain
and that makes me...

23:47.084 --> 23:50.709
- She's never really...
- She's not... and that makes me...

23:50.834 --> 23:52.834
- It makes me sad.
- Yeah.

23:53.334 --> 23:54.542
It's unbelievable.

23:54.751 --> 23:57.792
- What's so funny, asshole?
- This always happens to you.

23:58.167 --> 24:01.751
It's the same speech, word for word,
almost with the same commas

24:02.626 --> 24:05.292
I need to be loved,
looked after.

24:06.376 --> 24:07.626
Yeah, right.

24:09.001 --> 24:10.709
How are you and Valeria?

24:12.626 --> 24:15.459
Good, we're good.

24:15.959 --> 24:17.459
It's a good moment.

24:18.209 --> 24:20.334
A lovely moment.

24:50.334 --> 24:51.626
What are you doing here?

24:56.709 --> 24:58.167
I didn't have a class,

24:58.376 --> 25:01.542
The university was closed,
there was a strike...

25:01.709 --> 25:03.709
about I don't know what.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.376
Can you turn that off, please?

27:41.251 --> 27:43.001
What'll we do?

28:02.667 --> 28:04.334
I don't know,

28:05.417 --> 28:07.126
I'm stuck right now.

28:07.626 --> 28:09.417
Yes, I know.

28:09.584 --> 28:12.501
It's a bit harder than I expected.
Have a bit of patience.

28:12.626 --> 28:14.376
Give me a fucking break, Andrés.

28:15.751 --> 28:17.376
Nothing, nothing.

28:18.167 --> 28:21.751
I don't feel like talking now.
I'll tell you later.

28:22.667 --> 28:25.709
I don't know, a week or so.
I don't know how long I'll take.

28:26.042 --> 28:28.417
And pay me
the rest of the fucking advance.

28:29.459 --> 28:31.751
No. They didn't send me anything.

28:34.376 --> 28:35.417
How?

28:36.709 --> 28:38.084
What?

29:34.417 --> 29:36.751
Nothing like this
has ever happened to me.

29:36.876 --> 29:38.459
What happened?

29:39.501 --> 29:41.542
You know
what she said to me last week?

29:42.459 --> 29:45.667
That what she liked most about me
was my big cock.

29:46.626 --> 29:49.376
But she's obsessed about it.

29:49.584 --> 29:52.334
- But that's not so bad.
- I don't know how to use it.

29:53.292 --> 29:54.417
And she's right.

29:54.584 --> 29:56.667
- If I'm not comfortable...
- What?

29:56.834 --> 29:58.459
I come very quickly.

30:00.501 --> 30:01.584
Fuck.

30:03.834 --> 30:06.167
I told her I was starting
to feel something for her

30:07.084 --> 30:08.584
and she comes out with that.

30:09.167 --> 30:11.792
She asked why I don't start
seeing other girls,

30:11.917 --> 30:13.417
she doesn't mind.

30:13.626 --> 30:16.334
She wants to start
screwing other guys.

30:17.042 --> 30:19.667
She even said
she wanted to do a "gangbang".

30:20.501 --> 30:22.709
- You know what a "gangbang" is?
- What is it?

30:23.667 --> 30:25.042
Could I have two, please?

30:25.751 --> 30:28.542
Your problem is you're obsessed
with what you feel.

30:28.709 --> 30:31.626
Enjoy your freedom, look at me.
Marina didn't work out.

30:31.792 --> 30:34.792
Do I stay at home?
No, I'm ready for anything.

30:35.001 --> 30:37.376
Look, no one wants to be alone.
Neither do you.

30:38.126 --> 30:39.459
Look at me.

30:40.792 --> 30:42.251
I'm good fun.

30:42.417 --> 30:44.417
- I'm not Brad Pitt.
- No.

30:44.876 --> 30:46.292
- I'm likable.
- Yes.

30:46.459 --> 30:49.042
- I'm not the typical gym guy.
- No, for sure.

30:49.584 --> 30:52.834
- I have an attribute that is...
- Spectacular, I know.

30:53.459 --> 30:56.084
Yet all I want is a girl

30:56.251 --> 31:00.126
who has fun with me
and loves me. You realize?

31:00.667 --> 31:02.334
What's wrong?

31:03.042 --> 31:05.292
I start talking about this
and I get upset.

31:05.542 --> 31:09.084
I want to go home.
There are things I have to do.

31:09.251 --> 31:11.876
It's 5:00 a.m.,
what are you going to do?

31:12.042 --> 31:14.042
It's very late.
I've got lots to do.

31:14.167 --> 31:16.376
Finish your beer.
Relax, don't go.

31:16.542 --> 31:19.376
No, I'm going.
I have things to do.

31:33.376 --> 31:36.542
Excuse me, do you know
where Calle de la Reina is?

31:40.584 --> 31:42.959
I think it's that way,
but I'm not sure.

31:43.126 --> 31:46.334
- Thanks, I've just arrived here.
- I see. Welcome.

32:03.834 --> 32:05.001
Yes?

32:06.167 --> 32:07.167
<i>- Marina?</i>
- Yes.

32:07.334 --> 32:08.167
<i>You're right.</i>

32:08.626 --> 32:10.334
I'm predictable.

32:11.334 --> 32:12.667
Very.

32:13.626 --> 32:16.334
At times I'm so predictable
I bore myself.

32:16.459 --> 32:20.042
It's normal that you'd think:
"He'll never surprise me".

32:22.042 --> 32:25.001
<i>- You hear me?</i>
- Yes, yes.

32:25.501 --> 32:27.167
I want to invite you to breakfast.

32:27.376 --> 32:29.376
<i>- But what time is it?</i>
- I don't know.

32:29.542 --> 32:33.167
Let me bring you breakfast in bed
and then, if you want, I'll leave.

32:33.376 --> 32:36.209
And another thing.
don't comb your hair, OK?

32:36.876 --> 32:39.126
<i>Don't shower,
or brush your teeth, or anything.</i>

32:39.334 --> 32:42.001
<i>I'd like to see how you are
in the morning.</i>

33:12.126 --> 33:14.167
- Fuck.
- What?

33:14.876 --> 33:16.376
You're really pretty.

33:16.751 --> 33:18.876
- Come in.
- I'm serious.

33:22.501 --> 33:23.834
Is someone here?

33:24.751 --> 33:26.542
Yes, come on, I'll introduce you.

33:32.001 --> 33:34.626
- Gustavo, Victor. Victor, Gustavo.
- Hello, Gustavo.

33:35.834 --> 33:38.792
- Don't worry, he doesn't like anyone.
- Really? I'm the same.

33:39.292 --> 33:42.417
So, is he the man of your life,
or what happened?

33:42.584 --> 33:44.334
Yeah, kind of.

33:53.917 --> 33:55.459
You smell great.

33:56.459 --> 33:57.959
Yeah.

33:58.251 --> 34:01.459
I doubt it. Yesterday I was so tired
after rehearsal I didn't shower.

34:01.626 --> 34:05.126
- Even better, I love it.
- What a pig.

34:09.751 --> 34:12.001
- Coffee?
- Yes.

34:13.542 --> 34:14.542
Blue, red?

34:14.708 --> 34:16.001
Blue.

34:17.833 --> 34:20.126
I'll tell you the plan.
We have breakfast now,

34:20.333 --> 34:22.251
we tell each other
a bit about ourselves.

34:22.417 --> 34:25.626
You can shower if you want, or not.
You know I like it.

34:25.751 --> 34:28.833
- Have you anything to do later?
- No, not much.

34:29.001 --> 34:30.626
Good, we're going to the beach.

34:30.751 --> 34:33.292
- To the beach?
- Yes, it's 7:00 a.m. Do you drive?

34:33.458 --> 34:34.583
- Yes.
- Good.

34:34.751 --> 34:37.083
- Do you like the beach when it's cold?
- I love it.

34:37.292 --> 34:38.333
Even better.

34:38.501 --> 34:40.626
If we survive our first day together

34:40.792 --> 34:43.542
we'll spend the night there,
but without forcing things.

34:43.708 --> 34:45.833
If we spend the night there
and get on well,

34:46.001 --> 34:48.667
I think we can start thinking
about a life together.

34:51.667 --> 34:53.833
- Admit I've surprised you.
- You have.

34:59.084 --> 35:01.042
Has it ever happened to you that

35:01.751 --> 35:05.001
you look at people and imagine
how they'll be when they're old.

35:05.834 --> 35:07.876
- No, not a lot.
- No?

35:08.292 --> 35:10.834
- I left a guy for that.
- Really?

35:11.542 --> 35:13.334
I met his father,

35:13.584 --> 35:17.167
and then I looked at him
and I saw that man of seventy.

35:17.542 --> 35:18.626
It was horrible.

35:18.876 --> 35:21.251
Really, it was my paranoia
that killed us.

35:21.917 --> 35:23.876
I hope you never meet my father.

35:24.626 --> 35:26.001
He's completely bald.

35:27.959 --> 35:30.292
No, you'll be
a very attractive grandfather.

35:30.459 --> 35:32.501
Maybe a bit bald.
Around here.

35:32.667 --> 35:33.667
- Seriously?
- Yes.

35:33.834 --> 35:36.001
You never know with hair.
One day it just falls out.

35:36.167 --> 35:37.959
- Yes.
- You know what I do?

35:38.084 --> 35:40.084
- What?
- My weird fixation?

35:40.459 --> 35:42.459
I've never told anyone this.

35:42.626 --> 35:45.667
I imagine geometric figures
with syllables.

35:45.876 --> 35:48.626
For example: "Hi, how are you?"
That's a square.

35:48.792 --> 35:51.042
Hi-how-are-you,
four syllables.

35:52.251 --> 35:55.501
Seriously.
I'm really imaginative.

35:56.251 --> 35:58.751
Yes, and that was really personal.

36:28.834 --> 36:30.126
It's not bad.

36:31.042 --> 36:34.501
I notice something like...
the bubbles. And...

36:35.584 --> 36:37.417
But it's a gin and tonic, right?

36:38.251 --> 36:41.417
- Like any gin and tonic?
- No, no!

36:42.084 --> 36:45.001
This gin and tonic is... different.

36:45.917 --> 36:47.792
- Fuck it.
- It's...

36:47.959 --> 36:50.459
The difference
is in the tiny details.

36:52.126 --> 36:53.459
Some day you'll understand.

36:53.626 --> 36:55.334
- Can you see the details?
- Yes.

36:55.501 --> 36:57.876
I'm looking
and I can't find them.

37:00.376 --> 37:01.584
I love this song.

37:01.751 --> 37:03.751
Don't make me dance,
I can't dance.

37:03.917 --> 37:05.459
Yes, come on, just a bit.

37:13.126 --> 37:15.126
Everyone has seen me.

38:28.626 --> 38:30.334
Good morning.

38:31.751 --> 38:33.209
Good morning.

38:35.584 --> 38:37.334
Shall we live here,

38:37.501 --> 38:40.001
in this room, forever?

38:44.626 --> 38:46.792
Something to eat, a few movies...

38:47.459 --> 38:48.834
All day in bed.

38:55.917 --> 38:58.042
Tell me it'll always be like this.

39:00.417 --> 39:02.167
Just say yes.

39:05.584 --> 39:07.542
I promise.

39:29.834 --> 39:32.292
<i>- Hello.
- Hello.</i>

39:39.876 --> 39:41.292
<i>How about a kiss?</i>

39:52.084 --> 39:53.626
<i>Am I distracting you?</i>

39:56.251 --> 39:57.501
<i>Stop, stop.</i>

40:01.917 --> 40:03.417
<i>Unsettling you?</i>

40:04.959 --> 40:07.376
<i>- What?
- We're going to crash.</i>

40:15.834 --> 40:17.876
<i>- Hello.
- My love.</i>

40:18.709 --> 40:20.917
Talk dirty to me.

40:50.251 --> 40:53.126
Look, I know that...

40:54.376 --> 40:57.292
at the end, the situation
was really blocked,

40:57.459 --> 40:59.042
things were complicated.

40:59.167 --> 41:01.876
- We both really screwed up.
- I know.

41:02.042 --> 41:04.001
But I was also thinking about

41:04.126 --> 41:06.042
lots of beautiful things that we did,

41:06.959 --> 41:08.251
moments... I don't know.

41:08.417 --> 41:12.376
These days I couldn't stop
producing images of us.

41:14.126 --> 41:17.876
Like the first time we went
to the beach, remember?

41:18.126 --> 41:19.376
Do you remember?

41:20.292 --> 41:22.626
Well, and...

41:22.834 --> 41:26.459
And also the things
that could have happened.

41:26.626 --> 41:28.376
Yes, but they didn't happen.

41:28.917 --> 41:30.584
- It's not like that.
- Well...

41:30.751 --> 41:34.251
It's not that the girl is this way
and the boy is that way.

41:34.417 --> 41:37.167
Then one day both realize
they have to change,

41:37.334 --> 41:40.042
they marry and live happily
ever after. It's not like that.

41:40.167 --> 41:42.584
One day, I'm one way,
the next day, I'm another.

41:42.751 --> 41:44.376
- One day I love you...
- Fluctuating...

41:44.542 --> 41:47.667
Yes, one day I can't stand you,
the next, I think you're great.

41:47.959 --> 41:50.709
One day I know what I want,
another day, I don't.

41:50.876 --> 41:53.542
It's confusing. It's not like
those stories you write.

41:53.709 --> 41:55.376
It's a matter of statistics:

41:55.542 --> 41:57.709
the days you get on well,
the days you don't.

41:57.876 --> 42:00.792
And we, statistically,
get on like shit.

42:01.334 --> 42:03.167
What part won't you understand?

42:06.417 --> 42:10.126
If there's anything I could've done
so we don't end like this...

42:10.292 --> 42:11.834
I don't know.

42:12.001 --> 42:14.334
And we should have had kids.

42:16.001 --> 42:18.501
That's what people do.

42:18.667 --> 42:21.834
We'd stop thinking about us
and focus on something else.

42:22.834 --> 42:26.126
- You didn't want kids.
- But if we'd had them,

42:26.376 --> 42:27.584
this...

42:34.084 --> 42:36.792
- No, wait...
- I don't know why you rang me.

42:37.126 --> 42:40.001
- I was feeling better.
- So we could talk.

42:40.167 --> 42:42.459
Sit down, don't make a fuss.

42:42.626 --> 42:45.042
What's wrong?
Do you feel alone now? Is that it?

42:45.209 --> 42:46.334
Why not think before you talk?

43:07.334 --> 43:10.334
<i>In romantic comedies,
the couples are happy,</i>

43:11.001 --> 43:13.876
<i>at least when everything
is going right for them.</i>

43:14.459 --> 43:17.042
<i>A moment when,
if the movie ended there,</i>

43:17.209 --> 43:21.001
<i>we'd feel they'd be happy
for the rest of their lives.</i>

43:25.209 --> 43:27.917
<i>Forever, for all of eternity.</i>

43:29.959 --> 43:31.167
Hey, one thing.

43:32.459 --> 43:33.459
What?

43:34.626 --> 43:36.751
Are you sure
about what we're doing?

43:36.917 --> 43:38.126
No.

43:38.334 --> 43:41.917
But you gave up your apartment,
so we've got no choice.

43:44.084 --> 43:46.292
<i>With no crisis,
no problems, financial,</i>

43:46.459 --> 43:48.459
<i>sexual, family or otherwise.</i>

43:48.626 --> 43:50.834
- Darling, I love them.
- Really?

43:51.001 --> 43:52.001
They're wonderful.

43:52.167 --> 43:53.959
You can't find them anymore.

43:54.126 --> 43:56.751
<i>There are no arguments,
no conflicts, no infidelity,</i>

43:56.917 --> 43:58.417
<i>no illnesses...</i>

43:59.542 --> 44:02.626
<i>Absolute understanding
and total union.</i>

44:32.459 --> 44:36.167
<i>And, just to emphasize
how well they get on,</i>

44:36.376 --> 44:38.376
<i>how much in love they can be,</i>

44:38.542 --> 44:40.584
<i>their friends
are always in a mess.</i>

44:40.751 --> 44:44.959
she felt too young for
such a serious, stable relationship.

44:45.876 --> 44:47.751
She wanted
to be with other people

44:47.876 --> 44:51.292
she wasn't sure
about her feelings, blah blah.

44:51.459 --> 44:54.626
- Yeah, but how are you?
- To be honest, I want to die,

44:54.792 --> 44:55.959
You're not serious!

44:58.167 --> 45:00.292
I only have the strength
to watch series,

45:00.459 --> 45:01.834
any shit will do.

45:02.459 --> 45:03.917
I sit at home all day.

45:04.917 --> 45:07.792
- See what I left you the other day?
- Yeah, I couldn't get into it.

45:07.917 --> 45:11.251
The sixth season is the good one,
have a bit of patience.

45:11.417 --> 45:12.876
OK.

45:13.084 --> 45:14.792
I mean, it's not...

45:15.834 --> 45:17.459
The sixth is good.

45:18.334 --> 45:22.042
I liked the supporting actors.
The stupid brother, who did this...

45:22.251 --> 45:24.459
The one with glasses?
He dies.

45:25.042 --> 45:26.917
Fuck, the one I thought was funny.

45:30.459 --> 45:32.667
Third episode, second season.

45:33.334 --> 45:35.501
The way he talks, he must be sick.

45:36.459 --> 45:38.542
- No, he's run over by a truck.
- Fuck.

45:38.709 --> 45:40.459
He leaves the court, <i>kaput.</i>

45:42.042 --> 45:44.042
<i>They're all very happy.</i>

45:44.251 --> 45:47.667
It's a romantic comedy, asshole.
You want me to kill the mother?

45:47.834 --> 45:49.251
So, they're together now,

45:49.417 --> 45:52.667
And things are good,
and... what's going to happen?

45:52.834 --> 45:55.292
You'll see at the end.
Something will happen.

45:55.459 --> 45:58.042
- All right, then...
- Yes, yes.

45:58.292 --> 46:00.501
Cheer up, I'm going to pay you.

46:00.667 --> 46:03.376
I'm working hard
to sell the production company

46:03.542 --> 46:06.501
and I rang you because
I need you to do me a favor.

46:07.334 --> 46:11.042
No, no, don't worry,
It's nothing odd, it's just...

46:11.251 --> 46:13.334
Remember the Turk
I told you about?

46:13.709 --> 46:17.292
He met some French people
who are going to put in money,

46:17.459 --> 46:19.959
a small production company,
it all adds up,

46:20.084 --> 46:21.584
and that's where you come in.

46:21.751 --> 46:24.084
The idea is that
you write something,

46:24.292 --> 46:25.917
something that happens there.

46:26.501 --> 46:28.042
In France?

46:28.167 --> 46:31.167
Every romantic comedy
has got Paris in it.

46:31.376 --> 46:32.709
- But...
- Just a little scene,

46:32.876 --> 46:34.084
something stupid...

46:34.251 --> 46:37.626
You can easily do it,
you're so talented.

46:40.167 --> 46:42.876
Look, look, look...
Before you go,

46:43.042 --> 46:44.917
check out that girl.

46:49.959 --> 46:53.167
Every time you come,
she asks about you.

46:53.667 --> 46:56.876
She's Adriana, my girlfriend.
I told you about her.

46:57.042 --> 47:00.459
- Didn't I? I told you. She...
- What are you trying to say?

47:00.626 --> 47:03.584
She just suggested
that we could say to Valeria

47:03.751 --> 47:07.626
that the four of us could spend a day
at my house or at an hotel...

47:07.792 --> 47:10.959
- Are you crazy?
- It was her idea. Shall we try it?

47:11.126 --> 47:14.126
No, I've left Valeria.
It's all over.

47:14.292 --> 47:16.376
- You didn't say anything...
- Yeah, well...

47:16.709 --> 47:18.042
- How are you?
- I'm fine...

47:18.209 --> 47:20.417
Fine? Well, you're a writer

47:20.584 --> 47:23.542
and writers are odd,
they're people who can be alone.

47:23.876 --> 47:27.042
My apartment
is always there for you.

47:27.209 --> 47:30.042
I'd die before I shut myself
in an apartment with you.

47:30.209 --> 47:32.959
Listen to me,
talk to Valeria,

47:33.501 --> 47:36.959
mention the idea to her.
Maybe she'll accept

47:37.126 --> 47:41.042
- and things will work out.
- Son of a bitch! Don't touch me!

47:45.376 --> 47:47.376
- To Paris?
- Yes.

47:47.501 --> 47:49.542
But, why? Aren't you happy
here with me?

47:49.709 --> 47:51.959
Of course,
but it's an incredible opportunity.

47:52.126 --> 47:54.126
It's one of the best companies
in the world.

47:54.334 --> 47:57.334
- But what do I do?
- You come with me.

47:58.376 --> 48:01.667
Rehearsals finish at midday.
Then we can explore the city,

48:01.834 --> 48:04.501
visit museums,
you can learn French,

48:04.792 --> 48:05.917
get another job...

48:06.084 --> 48:09.459
- And give up my job here?
- You always complain about it.

48:09.626 --> 48:11.417
Yeah, but it's not that bad.

48:11.542 --> 48:15.001
But you could get something better.
You like designing.

48:15.167 --> 48:17.167
What's here?
A magazine with cars and girls.

48:17.376 --> 48:19.501
All day removing stretch marks
with Photoshop.

48:19.626 --> 48:22.292
- And it could close any time.
- That's not definite.

48:22.459 --> 48:24.501
Let's go, Victor. Let's go!

48:25.542 --> 48:29.376
I need this. Being a dancer here
is like being a bullfighter in Japan.

48:30.834 --> 48:31.834
Come on.

48:33.542 --> 48:36.709
You wanted to live abroad
some day, learn a language.

48:36.876 --> 48:38.959
You wanted to edit
a music magazine.

48:39.709 --> 48:42.501
This is the time.
If not now, when?

48:42.834 --> 48:43.834
True.

48:45.917 --> 48:47.376
Promise you'll think about it.

48:47.542 --> 48:50.042
I promise. I'll think it over.

49:42.167 --> 49:44.626
- You hear me?
- Yes.

49:44.751 --> 49:46.709
And you've got nothing to say?

49:48.042 --> 49:50.126
What do you want me to say?

49:50.709 --> 49:53.167
Something.
Did you like it or not?

49:53.376 --> 49:55.167
You saw the rehearsal.
We open in 3 days.

49:55.376 --> 49:57.667
Of course I liked it.
It's very good.

50:00.917 --> 50:03.376
- I don't know what else you want.
- You don't know...

50:03.542 --> 50:07.417
Don't keep on, don't pressure me.
I'm not a dancer.

50:07.834 --> 50:10.709
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

50:11.042 --> 50:12.584
What's wrong with you?

50:14.292 --> 50:15.917
Have you thought about Paris?

50:16.084 --> 50:19.084
Yes, but I'm still not certain.
It isn't an easy decision.

50:20.417 --> 50:21.751
Fuck it, Victor.

51:05.667 --> 51:06.917
Pablo.

51:08.542 --> 51:09.959
Lucía!

51:10.917 --> 51:13.084
What are you...? No!

51:15.834 --> 51:17.417
What are you doing here?

51:17.667 --> 51:20.126
I can't believe it,
after all this time...

51:20.417 --> 51:21.792
You're still the same.

51:22.834 --> 51:25.501
- Yes.
- It's been so long...

51:27.417 --> 51:29.626
- Are you still in Montevideo?
- Yes.

51:30.084 --> 51:32.251
- It's lovely, peaceful...
- That's good.

51:33.126 --> 51:35.667
But I still come here,

51:35.834 --> 51:38.459
- looking for the noise in Buenos Aires.
- A bit of chaos.

51:38.626 --> 51:41.042
Chaos, yes.

51:43.667 --> 51:47.167
- I thought you were in Spain.
- No, I was,

51:47.334 --> 51:50.542
for quite some time,
but I came back a while ago.

51:51.584 --> 51:53.542
And you buy your own books?

51:57.209 --> 51:58.584
Yes... Well,

51:59.959 --> 52:01.334
They're things that...

52:01.501 --> 52:03.667
- we writers do.
- We can't help it.

52:03.834 --> 52:07.459
- Inevitable.
- No! I don't believe it!

52:07.626 --> 52:10.167
I found it
in a bookstore near here.

52:12.376 --> 52:15.459
- Shall we swap?
- Yes, how could we not?

52:23.084 --> 52:26.501
- Are you writing?
- Well...

52:28.667 --> 52:31.126
- Something.
- Something? It's not coming out.

52:32.209 --> 52:34.667
Some things are, but it's not...

52:37.417 --> 52:40.126
They're stages.
It happens, don't worry.

52:41.376 --> 52:44.626
And if it doesn't,
come visit me in Montevideo.

52:46.417 --> 52:47.084
Yes?

52:49.376 --> 52:50.417
All right.

52:54.417 --> 52:57.417
- Tell me about yourself.
- What do you want to know?

52:58.626 --> 53:00.667
- Did you get married?
- No.

53:01.167 --> 53:02.459
Did you have children?

53:05.626 --> 53:08.292
No. Well, I was with someone until...

53:08.417 --> 53:10.376
until a few months ago.

53:11.584 --> 53:13.042
And, well,

53:14.209 --> 53:17.167
maybe we'll sort it out.
We talk on the phone.

53:24.459 --> 53:25.626
I separated too.

53:26.876 --> 53:28.376
Three years ago.

53:28.542 --> 53:31.292
Couples are complicated.

53:31.501 --> 53:34.126
They're complicated, yes.

53:40.209 --> 53:41.626
What's up, man?

53:42.917 --> 53:45.042
- I don't...
- Do you remember me?

53:46.084 --> 53:48.709
You're the first person I spoke to
when I arrived in Madrid.

53:48.876 --> 53:51.417
I remember you very well,
I asked you about a street.

53:52.084 --> 53:53.292
Remember?

53:56.292 --> 53:58.834
- I'm Camila.
- Victor. Pleased to meet you.

53:59.001 --> 54:01.334
- What are you doing?
- Coming out of work.

54:01.834 --> 54:02.667
That's great.

54:04.751 --> 54:06.626
Spring in Madrid is incredible.

54:06.792 --> 54:09.334
I love it.
Everything is kind of exultant,

54:09.501 --> 54:12.959
I don't know, exotic.
I feel... It's fantastic.

54:14.792 --> 54:17.334
- What are you doing here?
- Directing a play

54:17.501 --> 54:18.626
- that I wrote...
- Careful.

54:19.417 --> 54:22.584
I had some ideas
but I didn't really know

54:22.709 --> 54:26.042
where they were going.
A lecturer said: "Write it down".

54:26.209 --> 54:28.709
He insisted and, I swear,
he saved my life.

54:29.376 --> 54:30.834
- That's good.
- Yes, it is.

54:31.001 --> 54:32.876
- What's it about?
- A girl

54:33.042 --> 54:36.542
who falls in love with the super
of her building, and he with her.

54:36.709 --> 54:40.209
It's very intense,
he leaves his family, his job,

54:40.417 --> 54:42.126
- and they go off traveling.
- They go off.

54:42.334 --> 54:45.626
Yes, it's a love story with
autobiographical touches.

54:45.751 --> 54:47.417
Not everything, but some things.

54:47.584 --> 54:51.459
It's not all autobiographical,
but a bit. It's great.

54:52.542 --> 54:55.376
I thought it was no use,
and now it seems...

54:55.542 --> 54:58.709
We're going on tour
to Paris, Rome...

54:58.834 --> 55:01.626
- Really?
- Yes, it's great. Canada...

55:03.792 --> 55:06.417
I can stop working as a waitress.

55:06.584 --> 55:08.167
What are you doing now?

55:09.376 --> 55:10.834
I was going home.

55:12.292 --> 55:15.376
I won't be opening
for another hour.

55:16.042 --> 55:17.167
You want to come in?

55:27.334 --> 55:28.792
- Well...
- Well...

55:34.084 --> 55:35.834
This...

55:36.376 --> 55:38.876
I'm staying a few more days

55:39.001 --> 55:42.667
here in Buenos Aires.
If you want to...

55:43.334 --> 55:45.542
- All right.
- There's time...

55:45.709 --> 55:48.042
And if not, in Montevideo.

55:48.292 --> 55:50.167
- All right.
- What?

55:50.376 --> 55:52.084
- Where is it?
- It's here.

55:57.126 --> 55:58.459
We'll talk?

55:58.917 --> 55:59.917
OK.

56:00.417 --> 56:01.501
Thanks.

56:03.876 --> 56:07.334
- For the book, I mean!
- Oh, same here.

56:07.501 --> 56:09.417
Wait, one more thing.

56:09.584 --> 56:11.542
You can't open my book

56:11.709 --> 56:14.626
until you finish writing
what you're writing.

56:15.876 --> 56:18.251
- All right.
- It might help you...

56:19.376 --> 56:20.167
- Yes?
- OK.

56:20.376 --> 56:22.542
- It's a deal?
- It's a deal.

56:24.167 --> 56:25.626
Ciao.

56:58.709 --> 57:01.126
<i>Hi, this is Valeria.
Leave your message.</i>

57:24.709 --> 57:26.459
Fucking say something!

57:27.751 --> 57:28.751
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

57:32.959 --> 57:34.959
And she's stupid,
because she's stupid.

57:35.126 --> 57:37.709
Did you see what she wrote?
She's stupid!

57:40.751 --> 57:42.334
You son of a bitch!

57:43.501 --> 57:46.126
- Who else do you write to?
- No, no...

57:46.334 --> 57:47.126
Who?

57:50.834 --> 57:54.459
I'm fine. I'm sure
we'll get over this, I guess.

57:54.876 --> 57:56.376
You know what the problem is?

57:56.501 --> 57:59.001
We haven't been able
to find a solution.

57:59.167 --> 58:00.584
As human beings, I mean.

58:00.751 --> 58:02.709
- Mind the shit.
- Christ!

58:02.876 --> 58:04.959
For everything else, yes.
but not for this.

58:05.459 --> 58:07.459
You don't like your partner?
Separate.

58:07.626 --> 58:10.209
You like people of your own sex?
Get married.

58:10.417 --> 58:13.751
But for sex in a couple,
there's no good solution.

58:15.292 --> 58:18.292
Some married people spend their lives
wanting to screw someone else.

58:18.459 --> 58:21.042
Do they screw? No.
They repress it and suffer.

58:21.584 --> 58:23.709
Others do it.
Yippee, let's screw!

58:23.876 --> 58:26.501
But they have to cheat, lie,
hide to do it,

58:26.667 --> 58:28.459
and they suffer too.

58:29.501 --> 58:32.292
Others say: "I don't want to cheat,
I'll tell my partner".

58:32.459 --> 58:35.792
So they have group sex.
And that must be neat at first.

58:35.959 --> 58:39.501
But one day, they see the other
and start suffering like hell.

58:39.626 --> 58:41.292
There's no good solution.

58:41.667 --> 58:44.751
- Are you listening?
- Yes, there's no good solution.

58:46.751 --> 58:50.709
- Why should there be a solution?
- Give me the water. Just because...

58:51.459 --> 58:53.959
Can you simplify everything
in your life? I can't.

58:54.126 --> 58:56.334
Maybe we should separate
for a while

58:56.501 --> 58:58.042
to see what we feel.

58:58.209 --> 58:59.959
You still don't know what you feel?

59:01.292 --> 59:04.876
Yes, but distance helps you
see things more clearly.

59:05.042 --> 59:06.709
You're a dickhead,
I told you already.

59:06.876 --> 59:09.709
You'll screw with two, three,
twenty, whatever,

59:10.126 --> 59:13.126
but you'll end up
on your own again, in the shit.

59:13.334 --> 59:14.834
You'll be sorry, you'll see.

59:16.834 --> 59:17.792
<i>Right,</i>

59:17.959 --> 59:19.542
If they get over the first crisis,

59:19.667 --> 59:22.376
- if they can carry on.
- That's it.

59:22.542 --> 59:26.126
- We're at that point.
- They're both doing OK.

59:28.959 --> 59:31.417
- Do you want anything, love?
- No.

59:31.584 --> 59:33.459
Mom will be here any minute.

59:34.709 --> 59:36.917
Now, tell me... Answer that.

59:37.084 --> 59:38.167
- No, go on.
- Answer it.

59:38.376 --> 59:40.376
I'll call her later, don't worry.

59:40.542 --> 59:42.834
- What did you say?
- I'll call her later.

59:43.751 --> 59:45.751
- "Her"?
- Lucía.

59:46.376 --> 59:48.459
- Remember?
- You talked a lot about Lucía.

59:48.626 --> 59:51.917
- You did nothing with her.
- She had a boyfriend.

59:52.084 --> 59:54.209
After that, we didn't coincide.

59:55.584 --> 59:57.459
We met by chance the other day

59:57.709 --> 59:59.292
and ended up at my place.

01:00:01.542 --> 01:00:04.584
- She lives in Montevideo.
- How long is she staying?

01:00:05.917 --> 01:00:08.001
For a week, I think.

01:00:08.167 --> 01:00:09.376
Call her.

01:00:11.834 --> 01:00:13.292
Don't be...
What's wrong with you?

01:00:13.459 --> 01:00:16.792
- I've got other things on my mind.
- Listen to me, call her.

01:00:16.917 --> 01:00:19.917
I'm thinking about things...
Valeria is still there.

01:00:20.084 --> 01:00:22.376
- You and Valeria are finished.
- Stop.

01:00:22.542 --> 01:00:25.251
Remember the excuses you gave
for leaving her.

01:00:25.417 --> 01:00:26.251
Stop.

01:00:26.417 --> 01:00:29.417
- Or all the lovers that...
- That's enough.

01:00:31.959 --> 01:00:32.751
That's lovely!

01:00:34.501 --> 01:00:36.001
There's mom.

01:00:38.042 --> 01:00:40.417
We'll put this away.
A big kiss

01:00:40.917 --> 01:00:42.376
for uncle Pablo.

01:00:43.626 --> 01:00:46.042
- Ciao, Pablo.
- Ciao.

01:00:49.626 --> 01:00:50.459
Well...

01:00:51.251 --> 01:00:53.376
Big hug.

01:00:54.917 --> 01:00:55.917
Here.

01:00:56.042 --> 01:00:59.667
And tell mom that
I'll give her the money soon.

01:00:59.834 --> 01:01:00.959
OK.

01:01:02.292 --> 01:01:04.501
- Ciao, dad.
- Ciao, sweetheart.

01:01:08.042 --> 01:01:09.459
Getting back to...

01:01:09.626 --> 01:01:12.376
Have they made up or not?
Are they going to France?

01:01:14.917 --> 01:01:16.334
I've got no idea.

01:02:07.167 --> 01:02:09.584
<i>I don't like goodbyes,
You know that.</i>

01:02:09.751 --> 01:02:13.501
<i>I'll be back in six months, I think.
Look after the cat and the apartment.</i>

01:02:19.292 --> 01:02:20.709
<i>In almost all romantic comedies</i>

01:02:20.876 --> 01:02:23.042
<i>there's a moment
when the couple separate.</i>

01:02:26.084 --> 01:02:27.167
Taxi!

01:02:37.167 --> 01:02:39.167
<i>At times it's a trip
one of them has to make</i>

01:02:39.334 --> 01:02:41.001
<i>or, for some reason,</i>

01:02:41.167 --> 01:02:43.209
<i>given the imminent arrival
of solitude</i>

01:02:43.376 --> 01:02:46.417
<i>each has to consider
what's happened to date</i>

01:02:46.584 --> 01:02:49.084
<i>and what they want to happen
from now on.</i>

01:03:27.084 --> 01:03:29.959
<i>See if the love that worked
for a period of time</i>

01:03:30.126 --> 01:03:32.834
<i>was something that,
after a while, can be forgotten</i>

01:03:33.001 --> 01:03:35.501
<i>as easily as it sprang it up.</i>

01:03:37.667 --> 01:03:38.876
<i>Or not.</i>

01:03:41.084 --> 01:03:41.876
Thanks.

01:03:42.042 --> 01:03:45.376
<i>Maybe they have to realize
they're made for each other.</i>

01:03:57.792 --> 01:03:59.626
<i>Forever.</i>

01:04:32.834 --> 01:04:36.334
Lucas is away on a trip,
so don't worry.

01:04:39.626 --> 01:04:41.626
- Lucas?
- Yes.

01:04:42.334 --> 01:04:43.667
Didn't you know?

01:04:46.084 --> 01:04:49.292
Yes, I knew something,
but I didn't...

01:04:54.751 --> 01:04:57.042
Then you didn't know this either.

01:05:03.126 --> 01:05:05.459
I wanted to show you
because I'm not inviting you.

01:05:07.792 --> 01:05:10.042
We're not that modern.

01:05:11.876 --> 01:05:13.584
Cheer up!

01:05:22.126 --> 01:05:24.584
- Have you gone mad?
- Why?

01:05:26.167 --> 01:05:29.584
You?
You're getting married?

01:05:30.126 --> 01:05:33.667
Yes. He proposed
and I thought it would be fun.

01:05:35.126 --> 01:05:37.626
Come on, have fun with me!

01:05:39.876 --> 01:05:41.876
It's over, it's finished.

01:05:43.376 --> 01:05:44.876
Come on!

01:06:24.917 --> 01:06:27.417
Are you sure about this?

01:06:28.501 --> 01:06:29.917
No.

01:06:32.792 --> 01:06:36.084
But I told him yes
so I can't back out.

01:06:38.876 --> 01:06:40.376
Let's be friends.

01:06:41.917 --> 01:06:44.084
Let's not hate each other.

01:06:53.709 --> 01:06:57.584
And we have to celebrate it,
don't we?

01:06:57.751 --> 01:06:58.876
I think...

01:07:01.751 --> 01:07:02.834
You and I?

01:07:03.876 --> 01:07:05.126
I don't know.

01:07:07.917 --> 01:07:09.292
You want to fuck.

01:07:11.167 --> 01:07:13.917
- Why do you say "fuck"?
- What?

01:07:14.792 --> 01:07:18.084
Have you got sensitive?
Do I have to say "make love"?

01:07:18.251 --> 01:07:19.501
Do you prefer that?

01:08:02.334 --> 01:08:04.334
- Well...
- Well...

01:08:07.251 --> 01:08:09.876
- Good luck and all that.
- Thank you.

01:08:18.542 --> 01:08:21.792
- I love you very much.
- Me too.

01:10:36.001 --> 01:10:38.167
- How are you?
- Fine.

01:10:38.376 --> 01:10:40.626
- And you?
- Great, really good.

01:10:41.042 --> 01:10:42.167
That's nice.

01:10:43.459 --> 01:10:45.501
I took my stuff
out of the apartment.

01:10:45.667 --> 01:10:47.042
Yeah, thanks.

01:10:48.876 --> 01:10:51.501
I'm moving out too.
It's senseless keeping it on.

01:10:51.917 --> 01:10:54.751
And thanks for looking after the cat.
I missed him.

01:10:55.959 --> 01:10:57.084
That's OK.

01:11:04.792 --> 01:11:07.042
I'd give this one three points, right?

01:11:09.376 --> 01:11:10.626
It's a gin and tonic.

01:11:14.084 --> 01:11:17.251
- I'm going out to smoke. Coming?
- You're smoking again?

01:11:17.917 --> 01:11:21.001
Just so as to fuck up
all the French. A nonagon.

01:11:21.834 --> 01:11:24.917
Count: Just-so-as...

01:12:19.251 --> 01:12:22.001
- When do you leave?
- In two weeks.

01:12:22.584 --> 01:12:24.792
I'm here for Christmas and then...

01:12:26.292 --> 01:12:28.042
What are you up to?

01:12:30.167 --> 01:12:31.751
You were right.

01:12:32.209 --> 01:12:34.376
The magazine closed
and I lost my job.

01:12:34.542 --> 01:12:37.251
- I'm sorry.
- No, it worked out well.

01:12:37.417 --> 01:12:40.084
I got a good settlement
and I used it to start

01:12:40.251 --> 01:12:42.584
- that magazine I talked about.
- Yes?

01:12:42.751 --> 01:12:45.459
It's got a section called
"How to be a bullfighter in Japan".

01:12:45.626 --> 01:12:47.834
- It's a dance section.
- Really?

01:12:48.292 --> 01:12:49.667
That's great!

01:12:49.959 --> 01:12:52.751
We started on Internet
and we might move on to paper.

01:12:52.917 --> 01:12:54.334
But I don't care.

01:12:54.501 --> 01:12:57.417
I'm designing my own things.
I'm happy,

01:12:57.584 --> 01:12:59.917
I don't spend the day
removing stretch marks.

01:13:03.876 --> 01:13:06.376
- I'm delighted.
- So am I.

01:13:16.792 --> 01:13:18.501
Listen, forgive me.

01:13:21.126 --> 01:13:24.542
You and I haven't had
much luck, have we?

01:13:25.709 --> 01:13:27.876
Maybe if you were here,

01:13:28.042 --> 01:13:30.376
or I was there, whichever,

01:13:30.751 --> 01:13:34.126
it would be different.
But like this...

01:13:35.959 --> 01:13:37.709
I didn't want to change your life,

01:13:39.042 --> 01:13:40.459
or change mine either.

01:13:43.084 --> 01:13:44.459
Right.

01:13:44.917 --> 01:13:46.334
So...

01:13:47.459 --> 01:13:49.542
We'll talk before you leave, won't we?

01:13:49.751 --> 01:13:51.376
Yes, of course.

01:13:59.709 --> 01:14:01.709
Ciao.

01:14:38.292 --> 01:14:41.709
No... You're completely crazy.

01:14:41.876 --> 01:14:44.084
I didn't want to worry you.

01:14:44.542 --> 01:14:46.709
Did you believe
I had a new office?

01:14:46.876 --> 01:14:48.417
Come on, sit down.

01:14:52.084 --> 01:14:55.126
I didn't lie to you,
I do have an office.

01:14:55.376 --> 01:14:57.667
- Quite nice, isn't it?
- Are you OK?

01:14:58.917 --> 01:15:00.584
I'm getting out in two days.

01:15:01.334 --> 01:15:04.667
I know, you're going to tell me
it's my own fault...

01:15:04.792 --> 01:15:07.376
I know all you're going to say,
but it's not that.

01:15:08.917 --> 01:15:10.542
Adriana left me.

01:15:12.751 --> 01:15:14.126
What happened?

01:15:14.334 --> 01:15:18.167
We did a swap with the Turk
and they fell in love.

01:15:18.834 --> 01:15:21.459
The guy left his wife.

01:15:23.417 --> 01:15:25.126
You're a moron, Andrés.

01:15:26.459 --> 01:15:29.834
Yes, but every cloud
has a silver lining.

01:15:30.001 --> 01:15:33.959
The guy bought
the production company,

01:15:34.376 --> 01:15:35.459
all the movies

01:15:36.417 --> 01:15:39.459
He bought everything,
so I'll have money again.

01:15:39.626 --> 01:15:43.001
- And I can pay you for the script.
- At last!

01:15:43.334 --> 01:15:46.376
And I told him
that our financial agreement

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:49.542
was double what I'd told you,
so you'll get a hell of check.

01:15:49.834 --> 01:15:52.584
- No! You're a genius.
- Yes.

01:15:52.751 --> 01:15:55.084
- You're a genius.
- We can toast if you like.

01:15:55.292 --> 01:15:57.459
With what? Saline solution?

01:16:01.584 --> 01:16:03.542
I don't believe it!

01:16:04.917 --> 01:16:07.417
We're going to drink to life.

01:16:07.584 --> 01:16:10.959
We're going to drink to the script.

01:16:12.167 --> 01:16:14.792
It's almost finished.

01:16:15.084 --> 01:16:17.584
It seems I'm finally finishing
something I write.

01:16:17.751 --> 01:16:18.626
Congratulations.

01:16:22.959 --> 01:16:24.626
Now what are you going to do?

01:16:25.667 --> 01:16:26.834
Rest.

01:16:27.209 --> 01:16:30.334
Spend time with my children,
my grandchildren...

01:16:31.667 --> 01:16:35.334
You have to look after
the people you love, you know?

01:16:36.834 --> 01:16:38.001
What about you?

01:16:40.084 --> 01:16:42.834
I want to keep writing,

01:16:43.001 --> 01:16:45.626
finish some of the novels.

01:16:46.542 --> 01:16:48.959
Now that I'll have money,
it'll be easier.

01:16:50.001 --> 01:16:50.792
And?

01:16:51.876 --> 01:16:55.126
The other is harder for me
than for you.

01:16:56.042 --> 01:16:57.959
I don't fall in love so easily.

01:16:58.834 --> 01:17:01.376
- So I can call her now, can't I?
- Call who?

01:17:01.542 --> 01:17:02.376
Valeria.

01:17:02.542 --> 01:17:04.792
- She's gorgeous.
- I'm going to unplug you.

01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:08.501
Hello!

01:17:08.667 --> 01:17:11.084
What a lovely surprise!

01:17:11.501 --> 01:17:14.209
- Hi, dad.
- Hello, sweetheart.

01:17:15.251 --> 01:17:18.376
- Careful, I can't get up.
- Hi, grandpa, what happened you?

01:17:18.876 --> 01:17:20.959
- Nothing, darling.
- What happened you?

01:17:21.126 --> 01:17:23.084
Nothing... Something silly.

01:17:23.459 --> 01:17:25.376
Don't worry, everything's fine.

01:17:29.501 --> 01:17:30.834
<i>And so that is</i>

01:17:32.042 --> 01:17:33.292
where...

01:17:33.626 --> 01:17:36.459
you can think of the writer as...

01:17:38.417 --> 01:17:41.876
someone who is mid-way
between life...

01:17:43.001 --> 01:17:44.292
and his work.

01:17:47.459 --> 01:17:50.667
Well, I've got the essays.

01:17:50.834 --> 01:17:52.751
Weak, guys, eh?

01:17:54.042 --> 01:17:56.876
Anyone who didn't read
the classics is just lazy.

01:18:00.792 --> 01:18:02.584
<i>All romantic comedies</i>

01:18:02.959 --> 01:18:05.876
<i>always end
with a great declaration of love.</i>

01:18:06.042 --> 01:18:07.417
<i>And with a kiss.</i>

01:18:07.667 --> 01:18:10.084
<i>I said that was essential.</i>

01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:13.792
<i>What comes after, fortunately,</i>

01:18:14.292 --> 01:18:15.792
<i>we can't know.</i>

01:18:18.126 --> 01:18:20.542
<i>We only know what happened before.</i>

01:18:21.001 --> 01:18:23.834
<i>What those characters
had to go through to become</i>

01:18:24.001 --> 01:18:26.751
<i>who they are now and forever.</i>

01:18:28.417 --> 01:18:30.667
<i>Because the characters,
after that ending,</i>

01:18:30.834 --> 01:18:32.584
<i>can't change anymore.</i>

01:18:34.917 --> 01:18:38.376
<i>They will remain unalterable
in the best moment of their lives.</i>

01:18:39.334 --> 01:18:43.084
<i>Just before the moment
when the real problems should begin</i>

01:18:43.376 --> 01:18:47.376
<i>and when movies would start
to seem too much like life.</i>

01:18:48.126 --> 01:18:51.042
<i>Full of conflicts that
can't be solved, of doubts,</i>

01:18:51.251 --> 01:18:54.626
<i>of deaths, of illnesses,
of lies, of deceit...</i>

01:19:01.959 --> 01:19:04.542
<i>And I don't want movies
to seem like life.</i>

01:19:07.959 --> 01:19:09.876
<i>At least, not for now.</i>

01:19:50.167 --> 01:19:52.251
- I'm leaving.
- What?

01:19:53.167 --> 01:19:55.501
- I'm sorry, I have to go.
- Victor!

01:20:36.376 --> 01:20:37.667
What do you want?

01:20:38.334 --> 01:20:39.834
I want to be with you today.

01:20:40.292 --> 01:20:43.126
This year, and all the ones
coming afterwards too,

01:20:43.459 --> 01:20:45.542
because, whatever comes,
I want to do it with you.

01:20:45.834 --> 01:20:49.251
And if I have to change my life,
I'll do it. I don't care.

01:20:49.417 --> 01:20:52.167
And if you have to change yours
a bit too, do it.

01:20:52.376 --> 01:20:55.001
But we'll be together, agreed?
Wherever.

01:20:55.667 --> 01:20:58.167
There'll be other women in my life
and probably

01:20:58.376 --> 01:21:00.501
other men in yours,
better looking ones.

01:21:00.667 --> 01:21:02.126
But this is like gin and tonic:

01:21:02.334 --> 01:21:04.959
The importance is in the details.
And I like your details.

01:21:05.501 --> 01:21:07.917
The smell of your sweaty clothes
when you've been dancing.

01:21:08.084 --> 01:21:10.959
How you imagine
a different life very day.

01:21:11.126 --> 01:21:12.876
I like listening to you
tell me things,

01:21:13.001 --> 01:21:15.001
even though I don't really
understand what you're saying.

01:21:15.501 --> 01:21:17.167
I like that you imagine
how you'll be in 60 years

01:21:17.376 --> 01:21:19.792
and that you imagine how I'll be.

01:21:19.959 --> 01:21:23.542
And I love your gin and tonic,
the passion with which you make them.

01:21:23.834 --> 01:21:26.042
Because I want that passion
in my life.

01:21:26.251 --> 01:21:28.834
And the things I don't like about you
are like... the lemon pips

01:21:28.959 --> 01:21:31.084
that you spit out
and the gin and tonic is still good.

01:21:31.292 --> 01:21:33.959
When you discover that you love
someone, you can't waste time.

01:21:34.084 --> 01:21:37.292
And I don't want to waste time,
I want to look after you.

01:21:59.709 --> 01:22:01.209
THE END

01:23:17.292 --> 01:23:20.542
<i>For Pablo: for everything
that is in these pages,</i>

01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:23.251
<i>which are also partly yours.</i>
