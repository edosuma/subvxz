00:00.953 --> 00:02.703
Previously, on <i>Fringe...</i>

00:02.804 --> 00:04.154
Walter.

00:04.221 --> 00:07.908
I lost the people I loved most,
and I imagine you miss them too,

00:07.992 --> 00:08.909
the people you've
left behind.

00:08.993 --> 00:11.561
Yes, I do.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.763
I will help
you get home.

00:13.831 --> 00:15.332
You okay?

00:15.399 --> 00:16.783
Yeah, I just started
to get another migraine.

00:16.868 --> 00:20.120
<i>I was hoping I wouldn't</i>
<i>need these anymore.</i>

00:25.459 --> 00:27.844
<i>She's not gonna</i>
<i>remember the last two hours.</i>

00:27.912 --> 00:31.598
When she wakes up, she's gonna
have one hell of a headache.

00:31.682 --> 00:33.633
I have come to tell
you something.

00:33.718 --> 00:35.919
<i>Olivia...</i>

00:35.970 --> 00:38.522
Who the hell are you?
How did you know my name?

00:38.589 --> 00:41.691
I have looked
at all possible futures,

00:41.759 --> 00:45.812
and in every one,
the result is the same.

00:45.897 --> 00:48.732
You have to die.

00:54.822 --> 00:55.822
<i>That's him.</i>

00:55.907 --> 00:56.957
<i>Are you sure?</i>

00:57.041 --> 00:58.458
<i>They all look like</i>
<i>the same man.</i>

00:58.543 --> 01:00.777
<i>No, that's the one.</i>

01:00.828 --> 01:03.330
We've been looking at these
people for three years.

01:03.414 --> 01:04.947
Why did they
make contact now?

01:04.998 --> 01:06.049
I don't know.

01:06.116 --> 01:08.284
But he knew my name,
he knew who I was,

01:08.336 --> 01:09.452
and he knew
where to find me.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.638
<i>And then</i>
<i>he just vanished.</i>

01:11.722 --> 01:13.173
What exactly did he say?

01:13.257 --> 01:16.176
He said that he had seen
all possible futures,

01:16.260 --> 01:21.181
and in every one,
I had to die.

01:24.068 --> 01:25.485
<i>I had Astrid run</i>
<i>a sample of his blood.</i>

01:25.570 --> 01:26.820
<i>There was no match</i>
<i>on the DNA,</i>

01:26.904 --> 01:30.974
but she did find antibodies
for the Spanish flu.

01:31.025 --> 01:32.576
The Spanish flu?

01:32.643 --> 01:33.827
Isn't that extinct?

01:33.911 --> 01:36.079
Well, the last recorded
epidemic was in 1919.

01:36.147 --> 01:39.883
<i>Which makes them</i>
<i>a minimum of 91 years old.</i>

01:39.951 --> 01:42.502
I'm going to assign you
a security detail.

01:42.587 --> 01:43.503
<i>I don't think that</i>
<i>that's necessary.</i>

01:43.588 --> 01:44.754
He threatened you.

01:44.822 --> 01:48.341
I'm not sure that's
what he was doing.

01:48.426 --> 01:51.327
I--I think that he was
trying to warn me.

01:51.379 --> 01:53.430
If he approaches
you again,

01:53.497 --> 01:54.497
I expect you to
notify me right away.

01:54.548 --> 01:58.334
Of course.

Excuse me.

03:14.745 --> 03:16.346
Do you know her?

03:16.413 --> 03:17.764
No.

03:17.848 --> 03:19.382
Oh, God.

03:19.433 --> 03:20.750
Is that supposed
to be you?

03:20.801 --> 03:22.435
Ah, she's talented.

03:22.520 --> 03:24.604
Twisted, but talented.

03:24.689 --> 03:26.606
Why would anyone draw
something like that?

03:26.691 --> 03:28.058
Well, she's a teenager.

03:28.109 --> 03:29.476
Isn't that what they do?

03:29.560 --> 03:32.428
Play depressing music, and think
about how everything sucks,

03:32.480 --> 03:35.115
and then try and make everyone
else as miserable as they are.

03:35.199 --> 03:36.149
It's a stage.

03:36.233 --> 03:37.867
Stage or not,
that's creepy.

03:37.935 --> 03:39.035
<i>Hey, look out!</i>

04:15.707 --> 04:17.262
but since I'm not
supposed to exist here,

04:17.274 --> 04:19.358
it wouldn't respond to me.

It will require a biomechanical

We're discussing
cis-acting meiotic

04:36.794 --> 04:37.995
Don't worry, Olivia,

04:38.046 --> 04:39.580
I have no idea what he's
talking about either.

04:39.664 --> 04:40.864
What he's talking about

04:40.915 --> 04:42.249
is finally trying
to get me back home.

04:42.333 --> 04:44.885
I heard that Walter's
going to help you.

04:44.969 --> 04:46.837
I had to see you
with my own eyes.

04:46.888 --> 04:48.889
Oh, don't worry,
Agent Dunham.

04:48.973 --> 04:52.542
This won't interfere with
my usual work, I assure you.

04:52.594 --> 04:53.727
If you need me,

04:53.811 --> 04:55.378
I will give you
my full attention.

04:55.430 --> 04:56.597
It's okay, Walter.

04:56.681 --> 04:58.432
I'm just happy that you two
are working together.

04:58.516 --> 05:00.767
I can't say you're gonna get
his full attention, per se.

05:00.852 --> 05:02.152
He's a little
wired up today.

05:02.219 --> 05:03.820
He's already electrocuted
himself three times.

05:03.888 --> 05:07.241
Which reminds me, I can't feel
my urine response yet.

05:07.325 --> 05:13.247
I should probably go
empty my bladder again.

05:17.752 --> 05:19.086
Dunham.

05:19.170 --> 05:21.404
<i>- Hey.</i> 
<i>- This is a weird one.</i>

05:21.456 --> 05:24.174
It seems a crane operator
lost control of an I-beam,

05:24.241 --> 05:26.242
<i>which was then</i>
<i>tragically introduced</i>

05:26.294 --> 05:27.511
to a Robert Englehart.

05:27.578 --> 05:28.545
<i>And?</i>

05:28.596 --> 05:29.913
A few moments before
he was killed,

05:29.964 --> 05:31.682
someone handed
Mr. Englehart a sketch

05:31.749 --> 05:34.017
depicting him being skewered
by that same I-beam,

05:34.085 --> 05:39.306
<i>as if his death</i>
<i>was predicted.</i>

05:39.390 --> 05:40.757
<i>You still there?</i>

05:40.808 --> 05:43.110
Okay, so the person who--
who gave him the sketch,

05:43.194 --> 05:44.478
what did he look like,
was he bald?

05:44.562 --> 05:47.481
No, it was a she.
A teenage girl.

05:47.565 --> 05:49.900
<i>A coworker of the victim</i>
<i>was with him at the time.</i>

05:49.951 --> 05:52.319
<i>She thinks she could I.D.</i>
<i>the girl if she saw her again.</i>

05:52.403 --> 05:53.320
All right, well,
we need to collect

05:53.404 --> 05:55.271
all the surveillance
from the area.

05:55.323 --> 05:57.574
<i>I'm already on it.</i>

06:02.046 --> 06:03.297
<i>There you are.</i>

06:03.381 --> 06:04.381
Where have you been
all afternoon?

06:04.448 --> 06:06.216
Just around.

06:06.283 --> 06:07.334
Well, you know
you're supposed to call

06:07.418 --> 06:08.335
when you're
gone this long.

06:08.419 --> 06:09.336
Sorry.

06:09.420 --> 06:12.723
I met that kid
in 3-C today.

06:12.790 --> 06:13.790
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

06:13.841 --> 06:15.291
Dad's home.

06:15.343 --> 06:17.627
<i>- Perfect timing.</i> 
<i>- Dinner's almost ready.</i>

06:17.679 --> 06:19.062
Hey, buddy.

06:19.130 --> 06:21.198
<i>Hi.</i>

06:21.265 --> 06:23.183
- So how did it go today?
- Well--

06:23.267 --> 06:25.736
<i>The interview was great.</i>
<i>I start tomorrow.</i>

06:25.803 --> 06:27.971
<i>That's great.</i>

06:44.706 --> 06:47.924
<i>Looks like the view</i>
<i>from the lake house.</i>

06:47.992 --> 06:53.714
You miss it, don't you?

06:53.798 --> 06:58.218
Dad, aren't you tired of moving
us all around so much...

06:58.302 --> 06:59.219
Because of me?

06:59.303 --> 07:01.021
Doesn't matter
where we are.

07:01.105 --> 07:05.642
All that matters
is we're together.

07:05.710 --> 07:11.698
Why did God
make me like this?

07:15.036 --> 07:16.286
You know how I feel, em.

07:16.354 --> 07:19.039
God has a purpose
for all of us.

07:19.123 --> 07:22.659
Even if we can't
understand it.

07:22.727 --> 07:27.697
But I do know mine is
to take care of you guys.

07:27.749 --> 07:33.253
Hey, at least it hasn't
happened in a while.

07:33.337 --> 07:36.840
Let's, uh, keep these curtains
closed at night, okay?

07:36.891 --> 07:38.809
All right.
You get some sleep.

07:38.876 --> 07:40.477
I'll see you
in the morning.

07:40.544 --> 07:43.847
I love you, Dad.

07:43.898 --> 07:49.903
I love you too, Angel.

08:10.741 --> 08:12.125
<i>Any luck?</i>

08:12.210 --> 08:16.680
Agent Dunham.

08:16.747 --> 08:18.215
Were you able to I.D.
the girl who drew the picture?

08:18.266 --> 08:19.399
Not yet.

08:19.467 --> 08:21.301
Lincoln's with the witness
at the moment,

08:21.385 --> 08:22.853
looking at footage
from traffic

08:22.920 --> 08:28.859
<i>and surveillance cameras</i>
<i>in the area.</i>

08:28.926 --> 08:33.763
What?

08:39.620 --> 08:43.073
I got a call
from Health Services.

08:43.124 --> 08:46.493
You've been three times
in the last month?

08:46.577 --> 08:47.777
You checking up on me?

08:47.829 --> 08:52.282
I'm your commanding officer.
They tell me these things.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.121
Migraines.

08:58.172 --> 09:00.090
I needed a prescription,

09:00.141 --> 09:02.676
which is why I went
to Health Services.

09:02.760 --> 09:06.096
Headaches, that's all.

09:12.236 --> 09:17.190
Do you believe
in fate, sir?

09:17.275 --> 09:21.912
No. I don't.

09:21.979 --> 09:24.447
Neither did I.

09:24.499 --> 09:27.617
But this drawing...

09:27.668 --> 09:30.086
How is it the day after
a complete stranger

09:30.154 --> 09:31.454
tells me
I'm going to die,

09:31.506 --> 09:32.956
I end up
investigating a case

09:33.007 --> 09:38.512
where the victim's death
is predicted?

09:38.596 --> 09:41.548
I mean, maybe--

09:41.632 --> 09:47.637
that man from the opera house--
maybe he does know something.

09:53.778 --> 09:56.863
Just for the next
few days...

09:56.948 --> 09:59.533
Maybe we should
be vigilant.

09:59.617 --> 10:05.288
Keep you out
of harm's way.

10:34.569 --> 10:35.852
<i>Good news.</i>

10:35.903 --> 10:37.654
Robert Englehart's
coworker just I.D.ed

10:37.721 --> 10:39.856
the teenage girl
from surveillance tapes.

10:39.907 --> 10:41.024
We got a good image
from the bank

10:41.075 --> 10:42.692
across the street
from the cafe.

10:42.743 --> 10:43.860
Okay, so do we know
where she went?

10:43.911 --> 10:45.228
We know where
she didn't go.

10:45.279 --> 10:47.730
Surveillance showed her bypass
the 8th Street bus stop,

10:47.782 --> 10:49.899
she also walked right by
the subway entrance.

10:49.951 --> 10:51.401
Okay, so there's
a good chance

10:51.452 --> 10:52.535
that she lives
somewhere in the area.

10:52.587 --> 10:54.504
Maybe she goes
to school nearby.

11:44.121 --> 11:45.255
Stop the bus!

12:06.143 --> 12:07.777
I tried.

12:13.162 --> 12:15.576
Wait, 6/8
is the same as 3/4?

12:15.693 --> 12:16.776
<i>Right.</i>

12:16.844 --> 12:18.678
You keep dividing
the fractions in half,

12:18.729 --> 12:20.030
till you can't without
changing the denominator.

12:20.114 --> 12:22.482
No offense, Mom,
but I understand this way better

12:22.533 --> 12:23.533
when Emily explains it.

12:30.541 --> 12:31.625
Uh, good morning, sir.

12:31.692 --> 12:34.578
Ma'am,
sorry to bother you.

12:34.662 --> 12:36.880
I'm Agent Olivia Dunham,
this is Lincoln Lee.

12:36.964 --> 12:37.881
We work for the FBI.

12:37.965 --> 12:39.966
What can I do for ya?

12:40.034 --> 12:41.551
We're looking
for this girl.

12:41.636 --> 12:44.220
We've been going door to door,
asking people if they know her.

12:44.305 --> 12:48.758
<i>One of your neighbors said</i>
<i>she might live in the building.</i>

12:48.843 --> 12:50.977
No, I don't think so.
What's her name?

12:51.045 --> 12:53.763
We don't know.

12:53.848 --> 12:56.483
Do you mind if I ask who else
lives here with you, Mr...

12:56.550 --> 12:58.151
Mallum.
Jim Mallum.

12:58.218 --> 13:01.321
<i>It's just my wife Diane</i>
<i>and our son.</i>

13:01.388 --> 13:04.941
Danny, come here.

13:05.026 --> 13:07.027
You see this girl around?

13:07.078 --> 13:08.995
Wait, is she the one we see
at the park every so often?

13:09.063 --> 13:10.664
I think so.

13:10.731 --> 13:12.532
Yeah. That's Tanner Park.

13:12.583 --> 13:13.917
It's about
four blocks over.

13:14.001 --> 13:15.535
You might want to try looking
for her around that area.

13:15.586 --> 13:17.337
Thank you.
You've been very helpful.

13:17.404 --> 13:22.342
I wish I could offer more.

13:22.409 --> 13:24.961
- Did you happen to notice the cabinet?
- No, why?

13:25.046 --> 13:28.548
Red backpack, same one she's
wearing in the picture.

13:28.599 --> 13:31.134
<i>So why did</i>
<i>he lie to us?</i>

13:31.218 --> 13:32.719
As soon as we
get back to HQ,

13:32.770 --> 13:35.021
I'll get the paperwork started
on getting a warrant.

13:35.089 --> 13:38.224
Maybe we won't have to.

13:38.275 --> 13:40.694
Uh, hi.

13:40.761 --> 13:42.278
<i>I'm Olivia Dunham,</i>
<i>and this is Lincoln.</i>

13:42.363 --> 13:45.115
<i>We both work for the FBI.</i>

13:45.199 --> 13:47.600
It's okay, you're not
in any trouble.

13:47.652 --> 13:51.071
We just want to talk.

13:51.122 --> 13:56.626
Did you draw this?

13:56.711 --> 13:58.545
Is he dead?

13:58.612 --> 14:03.383
Yes, but I think
you already knew that.

14:03.450 --> 14:07.303
How? How were you able to draw
this before the accident?

14:07.388 --> 14:11.091
I don't know.

14:11.142 --> 14:13.143
I just see it...

14:13.227 --> 14:15.628
In my head...

14:15.680 --> 14:18.648
Whenever I'm around
someone who's gonna--

14:18.716 --> 14:21.351
I just sense it.

14:21.435 --> 14:24.804
You just sense what?

14:24.855 --> 14:29.409
Death.

14:33.614 --> 14:35.031
That drawing...

14:35.116 --> 14:38.752
Did you see something else
that's gonna happen?

14:38.819 --> 14:40.420
Maybe we can stop it.

14:40.487 --> 14:41.421
<i>Emily!</i>

14:41.488 --> 14:43.173
- Get in the house.
- Mr. Mallum--

14:43.257 --> 14:45.258
<i>You can't question her</i>
<i>without parental consent,</i>

14:45.325 --> 14:46.459
and I'm not giving it.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.094
You lied to us.

14:48.162 --> 14:50.046
<i>Actually, sir, we don't</i>
<i>need your consent.</i>

14:50.131 --> 14:52.932
<i>It's up to Emily whether or not</i>
<i>she wants to talk to us.</i>

14:53.000 --> 14:56.219
Emily.

14:56.303 --> 15:02.225
Do you want to continue to
answer these agents' questions?

15:02.309 --> 15:03.309
No.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.228
There's your answer.

15:05.312 --> 15:08.782
Come on, Em.
Let's go.

15:08.849 --> 15:10.784
Let me ask you something.

15:10.851 --> 15:11.785
You think you're
the first people

15:11.852 --> 15:13.820
to come after my daughter?

15:13.871 --> 15:16.489
It always starts this way.

15:16.540 --> 15:19.125
Authorities show up when they
get wind of a girl with her...

15:19.193 --> 15:20.243
ability.

15:20.327 --> 15:22.579
Then others come
who want to study her,

15:22.663 --> 15:24.964
<i>like those people</i>
<i>at Massive Dynamic.</i>

15:25.032 --> 15:27.467
Massive Dynamic?

15:27.534 --> 15:30.420
And they never stop.

15:30.504 --> 15:32.722
No matter where we go,
they find her.

15:32.807 --> 15:34.674
Watching from their cars,
waiting for the right moment

15:34.725 --> 15:38.478
to grab her,
take her to their labs.

15:38.545 --> 15:41.564
They poke and prod her
like she's some kind of animal.

15:41.649 --> 15:47.070
You have any idea what
that does to a young girl?

15:50.691 --> 15:53.243
Please...

15:53.327 --> 15:54.694
Let my daughter
have the chance

15:54.745 --> 16:00.750
at what's left
of a normal childhood.

16:05.456 --> 16:07.006
My number's on the card.

16:07.074 --> 16:08.758
If you change your mind
and want to talk,

16:08.843 --> 16:12.629
or if you and your family
are being harassed,

16:12.713 --> 16:17.217
I think I can help.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.472
Okay, when we get
back to the office,

16:22.556 --> 16:24.724
can you run a background check
on the Mallums?

16:24.775 --> 16:26.609
See what we can find out.

16:26.694 --> 16:29.428
I'm gonna pay
a visit to someone.

16:29.480 --> 16:31.314
Listen, you did
the right thing out there.

16:31.398 --> 16:33.566
If it's happening again,
no one can know.

16:33.617 --> 16:39.322
It puts us all at risk.

16:39.406 --> 16:40.606
Dad, I saw
something else.

16:40.658 --> 16:43.126
On the bus.

16:43.210 --> 16:48.882
Something awful.

16:48.949 --> 16:51.551
I'm sorry, sweetie,
but you know how this works.

16:51.618 --> 16:53.619
Even if you told 'em,
would it make a difference?

16:53.671 --> 16:57.473
Remember what they did to you
when we tried to help before?

16:57.558 --> 16:59.676
Trust me, okay?

16:59.760 --> 17:04.463
It's better this way.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.401
<i>I'd certainly like</i>
<i>to see the results for that.</i>

17:08.468 --> 17:11.905
Sooner rather than later.

17:11.972 --> 17:14.357
Yeah, well,
send them to me directly.

17:14.441 --> 17:17.327
What a nice surprise.

17:17.411 --> 17:18.661
<i>If I'd known you were coming,</i>
<i>i would've canceled my lunch.</i>

17:18.746 --> 17:21.079
Hi.

17:21.147 --> 17:24.650
Uh, I'm actually here
about Emily Mallum.

17:24.702 --> 17:26.419
Her father says
that Massive Dynamic

17:26.486 --> 17:28.121
has been harassing her
and her family.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.672
Oh, are you
asking me a question,

17:29.757 --> 17:31.374
or are you accusing me
of something?

17:31.458 --> 17:35.128
Well, I thought you said
that you were done

17:35.179 --> 17:36.495
using children
as test subjects.

17:36.547 --> 17:37.931
Yes, we are.

17:37.998 --> 17:40.666
Massive Dynamic did
approach the Mallum family

17:40.718 --> 17:42.051
when they lived
in Baltimore.

17:42.136 --> 17:44.270
Emily exhibited some
fascinating precog abilities

17:44.338 --> 17:47.140
that would've allowed us
to make drastic advances

17:47.207 --> 17:48.341
in our study
of the human brain.

17:48.392 --> 17:51.327
We simply wanted
to catalog her abilities.

17:51.395 --> 17:52.862
Her father
wasn't interested,

17:52.930 --> 17:58.451
even when we offered to pay
for Emily's schooling.

17:58.518 --> 18:04.123
I don't know how you could've
raised me for so many years,

18:04.191 --> 18:06.576
and seen all the damage
that was done to me,

18:06.660 --> 18:08.294
and pretend that there's nothing
wrong with what you just said.

18:08.362 --> 18:10.413
Olivia, I am sorry.

18:10.497 --> 18:13.383
Now, what happened
to you was awful.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.700
But this girl
is different.

18:14.752 --> 18:16.386
No one made her
this way.

18:16.470 --> 18:20.390
I don't see the difference.
I mean, it's still abuse.

18:25.679 --> 18:27.213
Dunham.

18:27.264 --> 18:28.231
<i>It's Emily.</i>

18:28.299 --> 18:32.218
You said you wanted
to help, Agent Dunham.

18:32.269 --> 18:34.487
Can you meet me?

18:34.554 --> 18:36.739
Can you hold on
one moment?

18:36.824 --> 18:42.829
I'm sorry, I have to go.

18:51.571 --> 18:53.239
<i>Emily?</i>

18:59.263 --> 19:02.215
You picked a nice place
for us to meet.

19:02.266 --> 19:07.920
It reminds me of a place
we used to live.

19:07.988 --> 19:12.976
A better time.

19:13.043 --> 19:16.529
I sometimes sneak
out here to think.

19:16.596 --> 19:21.484
To clear my head.

19:21.568 --> 19:27.490
Does your father know
that you called me?

19:27.574 --> 19:32.996
So what did you want
to tell me, Emily?

19:40.054 --> 19:43.306
<i>I think a lot of people</i>
<i>are gonna die.</i>

19:53.110 --> 19:55.295
It started when I was 11.

19:55.379 --> 19:57.630
I was in a pet store
with my mother.

19:57.715 --> 20:01.351
We were looking at puppies,
when suddenly I heard this hum.

20:01.418 --> 20:04.587
I thought something
was wrong with my ears,

20:04.638 --> 20:06.222
like you know how
sometimes after

20:06.289 --> 20:07.957
you've flown
in an airplane,

20:08.008 --> 20:10.459
but then,
when we were leaving,

20:10.511 --> 20:12.512
the man behind the counter
had a heart attack.

20:12.596 --> 20:15.982
<i>I saw it in my mind</i>
<i>before it happened.</i>

20:16.066 --> 20:17.483
<i>That was the first time.</i>

20:17.568 --> 20:19.319
How long before
it happened again?

20:19.403 --> 20:20.970
A few months.

20:21.021 --> 20:24.524
<i>I heard the hum</i>
<i>during class,</i>

20:24.608 --> 20:27.010
and an image
popped into my head.

20:27.077 --> 20:31.698
My teacher lying dead in the
street, covered in broken glass.

20:31.782 --> 20:33.599
Three days later,
she got hit by a car.

20:33.667 --> 20:36.786
My parents took me
to a doctor, but--

20:36.837 --> 20:41.290
and then people started
to do tests on me.

20:41.342 --> 20:43.325
<i>And my friends</i>
<i>heard about it.</i>

20:43.377 --> 20:47.213
And that's when
people got scared?

20:47.297 --> 20:49.382
And then you moved.

20:49.466 --> 20:52.635
<i>The first time.</i>

20:52.686 --> 20:56.305
<i>But it kept happening.</i>

20:59.360 --> 21:01.227
<i>Hmm. Fascinating.</i>

21:01.311 --> 21:05.014
The theta-one waves
in your occipital lobe

21:05.065 --> 21:06.348
are remarkably active.

21:06.400 --> 21:10.019
And also, your brain seems to be
drawing elevated levels

21:10.070 --> 21:13.189
of both oxygen and blood.

21:13.240 --> 21:15.591
Meaning what, Walter?

21:15.659 --> 21:18.177
Belly and I always
had a theory

21:18.245 --> 21:20.079
<i>that some traumatic events</i>

21:20.164 --> 21:22.832
echo backward in time.

21:22.883 --> 21:25.218
Put simply,
some future events

21:25.302 --> 21:28.221
ripple backwards.

21:28.305 --> 21:30.556
<i>Well, not in a way that we're</i>
<i>consciously aware of,</i>

21:30.641 --> 21:32.675
but it's sort of
like vibrations.

21:32.726 --> 21:34.660
And perhaps your brain

21:34.728 --> 21:39.182
is uniquely sensitive
to these vibrations.

21:39.233 --> 21:41.234
So it's possible that's
the hum that you hear.

21:41.318 --> 21:43.403
<i>Have you ever</i>
<i>been able</i>

21:43.487 --> 21:44.604
to control this ability?

21:44.688 --> 21:46.105
That's not how it works.

21:46.190 --> 21:49.525
These images I see...

21:49.576 --> 21:50.777
They're like dreams.

21:50.861 --> 21:55.564
<i>At first they're vivid,</i>
<i>but then they fade.</i>

21:55.616 --> 21:57.617
<i>That's why I draw them.</i>

21:57.701 --> 22:00.253
But it wouldn't
matter anyway.

22:00.337 --> 22:02.305
Whatever I see...

22:02.372 --> 22:05.241
Somehow it always happens.

22:05.292 --> 22:08.344
<i>I know all these people</i>
<i>are gonna die,</i>

22:08.411 --> 22:10.763
but there's nothing
I can do to stop it.

22:10.848 --> 22:12.181
<i>I don't understand, Emily.</i>

22:12.249 --> 22:14.684
Why do you warn them if they
can't do anything about it?

22:14.751 --> 22:18.638
I don't know.

22:18.722 --> 22:23.092
I guess if people knew,

22:23.143 --> 22:25.144
maybe they could say
"I love you" to someone.

22:25.229 --> 22:30.766
Or just do
one good thing.

22:33.370 --> 22:35.288
<i>Maybe we can I.D. this man.</i>

22:35.372 --> 22:38.107
She said she saw him
on the bus.

22:38.158 --> 22:40.743
I'll check
the MBTA database.

22:40.794 --> 22:45.414
If he has a bus pass,
they might have his photo.

22:49.786 --> 22:52.972
I haven't thanked you
for calling.

22:53.056 --> 22:56.893
That must've been hard.

22:59.229 --> 23:02.431
Can I ask you a question?

23:02.483 --> 23:05.651
Are you sensing
anything now?

23:05.736 --> 23:10.740
Like, here with me?

23:18.699 --> 23:19.648
<i>Emily.</i>

23:19.700 --> 23:20.666
Dad.

23:20.751 --> 23:22.251
We called him.

23:22.319 --> 23:25.004
We didn't want your parents to
worry when you didn't come home.

23:25.088 --> 23:26.655
Did they hurt you?
Mr. Mallum...

23:26.707 --> 23:28.374
You don't need
to worry about us.

23:28.458 --> 23:30.710
<i>Even if we've never</i>
<i>been able to stop it,</i>

23:30.794 --> 23:32.128
let them at least try.

23:32.179 --> 23:33.229
<i>We got something.</i>

23:33.297 --> 23:35.765
Astrid found him.
She got an address.

23:35.832 --> 23:36.766
According to his bus pass,

23:36.833 --> 23:38.167
his name is
Albert Duncan,

23:38.218 --> 23:40.336
he's got an apartment
in Jamaica Plain.

23:40.387 --> 23:41.771
- Let's go.
<i>- And then what?</i>

23:41.838 --> 23:43.272
Even if you can
save Mr. Duncan,

23:43.340 --> 23:44.273
what about the rest
of the people in that drawing?

23:44.341 --> 23:45.775
<i>I don't know.</i>

23:45.842 --> 23:48.227
But we're certainly not gonna
help anything by standing here.

23:48.312 --> 23:51.147
Thank you.

23:51.198 --> 23:52.732
Can my daughter and I
please go home now?

23:52.816 --> 23:54.567
If there's nothing more
she can do for you.

23:54.651 --> 23:58.854
No, I think
actually there is.

23:58.906 --> 24:00.373
Walter, I think
you can hypnotize Emily

24:00.457 --> 24:01.374
<i>to recover her vision</i>

24:01.458 --> 24:05.595
<i>of the event</i>
<i>in that drawing.</i>

24:05.662 --> 24:09.081
Wh--wh--what makes you think
I can do that?

24:09.166 --> 24:10.383
<i>Because where I'm from,</i>

24:10.467 --> 24:15.471
I've seen you
do it before.

24:23.564 --> 24:25.848
So is Albert
in some kind of trouble?

24:25.899 --> 24:27.817
We really don't know.

24:27.884 --> 24:30.719
Sure, I understand.
I wouldn't tell me either.

24:30.771 --> 24:34.390
Hey. Uh, Mr. Duncan
isn't home yet.

24:34.441 --> 24:35.391
He works construction.

24:35.442 --> 24:36.576
We called his boss,

24:36.660 --> 24:37.577
and apparently he's
been away all week.

24:37.661 --> 24:38.995
<i>How's it going there?</i>

24:39.062 --> 24:41.614
Walter's just
getting started.

24:54.378 --> 24:59.899
Emily, I'm going to count
backwards from three.

24:59.967 --> 25:04.520
And when I reach one,
I want you to open your eyes,

25:04.587 --> 25:08.474
and tell me where you are.

25:08.558 --> 25:09.976
Three...

25:10.060 --> 25:11.978
Two...

25:12.062 --> 25:13.062
One.

25:17.067 --> 25:19.368
<i>Where are you, Emily?</i>

25:19.436 --> 25:20.369
<i>On the bus.</i>

25:20.437 --> 25:25.041
On the way home.

25:25.108 --> 25:31.047
Do you see Mr. Duncan?

25:31.114 --> 25:33.749
<i>No.</i>

25:33.800 --> 25:35.301
But I hear it.

25:35.385 --> 25:36.952
<i>I hear the hum.</i>

25:37.004 --> 25:38.954
Look around, Emily.

25:39.006 --> 25:43.625
Find Mr. Duncan.

25:48.465 --> 25:49.982
<i>I see him.</i>

25:50.067 --> 25:53.635
<i>He's getting off the bus.</i>

25:53.687 --> 25:55.354
Guide her, Walter,
you can do this.

25:55.439 --> 26:00.276
Uh--um, Emily, listen...

26:00.327 --> 26:02.811
Don't let
Mr. Duncan get away.

26:02.863 --> 26:05.814
You'll have to catch up
with him. Can you do that?

26:05.866 --> 26:07.483
Yes.

26:07.534 --> 26:09.168
<i>Follow him, Emily.</i>

26:09.252 --> 26:12.788
<i>We need to know</i>
<i>where he's going.</i>

26:13.840 --> 26:16.375
What is it?

26:17.678 --> 26:19.495
Oh, God.

26:30.440 --> 26:33.559
Where are you?

26:33.643 --> 26:36.395
I don't know.

26:36.480 --> 26:40.282
But it's bad.

26:40.350 --> 26:41.951
Oh, God.

26:42.018 --> 26:44.870
They're dead.

26:44.955 --> 26:46.655
They're all dead.

26:46.707 --> 26:47.873
<i>Look around, Emily.</i>

26:47.958 --> 26:50.126
<i>Describe what you see.</i>

26:50.193 --> 26:53.329
Tell me where you are.

27:05.708 --> 27:07.209
I'm scared.

27:07.260 --> 27:10.012
There's nothing
to be frightened of.

27:10.063 --> 27:13.315
Nothing can hurt you.

27:13.383 --> 27:14.716
You know what, Mr. Mallum,

27:14.768 --> 27:20.606
<i>maybe if she heard your voice,</i>
<i>it might help her.</i>

27:23.994 --> 27:29.498
Sweetheart, it's me.

27:29.566 --> 27:34.336
Look around.
Tell me what you see.

27:39.409 --> 27:42.261
<i>- I see something.</i> 
<i>- It looks like Latin.</i>

27:42.345 --> 27:44.597
"Dei judicium...

27:44.681 --> 27:48.801
...fiat justitia."

27:48.885 --> 27:49.802
"By the judgment of God,
let justice be done."

27:49.886 --> 27:50.803
Mm-hmm.

27:50.887 --> 27:53.272
I need to borrow
your phone, please.

27:53.356 --> 27:54.807
Dunham.

27:54.891 --> 27:56.809
It's me.
It's a courthouse.

27:56.893 --> 27:59.094
It's happening
at a courthouse.

27:59.146 --> 28:02.097
Peter, Albert Duncan
just got divorced.

28:02.149 --> 28:04.116
The settlement
was last week.

28:04.201 --> 28:05.367
<i>He lost custody</i>
<i>of his kids.</i>

28:05.435 --> 28:07.119
<i>Maybe he's not</i>
<i>so happy about it.</i>

28:07.204 --> 28:10.539
When I count to three,
I want you to wake up.

28:10.607 --> 28:13.775
I see him.

28:13.827 --> 28:18.881
I see Mr. Duncan.

28:18.948 --> 28:24.887
He's holding something.

28:24.954 --> 28:27.506
Some sort
of weird-looking radio.

28:27.591 --> 28:29.008
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>it's a radio.</i>

28:29.092 --> 28:31.727
I think it's a detonator.
Duncan's not the victim.

28:31.794 --> 28:34.263
<i>He must be setting up</i>
<i>some kind of bomb.</i>

28:52.147 --> 28:53.981
Move, move move!
Go! Move!

29:05.543 --> 29:07.745
Courthouse security office
pulled surveillance

29:07.829 --> 29:08.796
of Albert Duncan's vehicle
entering the south entrance

29:08.863 --> 29:10.380
of the parking garage
20 minutes ago.

29:10.448 --> 29:11.381
We'll assume he's still
in the building.

29:11.466 --> 29:12.666
What about the bomb?

29:12.717 --> 29:14.501
Given the amount of destruction
in Emily's vision,

29:14.552 --> 29:16.369
we assume that
he couldn't possibly have

29:16.421 --> 29:17.387
that amount of explosives
strapped to his person.

29:17.472 --> 29:18.806
The way Emily
described it,

29:18.873 --> 29:20.557
it was as though
the ground erupted.

29:20.642 --> 29:21.925
Right, so we'll assume
the explosive

29:22.010 --> 29:23.376
is in the parking garage
beneath the building.

29:23.428 --> 29:24.728
<i>Bomb squad's about</i>
<i>to go in and look for it.</i>

29:24.813 --> 29:25.763
Peter's gonna join them.

29:25.847 --> 29:26.764
I can help.

29:26.848 --> 29:28.098
Sir, we're ready.

29:28.183 --> 29:32.770
Go. We'll start
evacuating the building.

29:32.854 --> 29:36.657
Dad, I'm sorry.

29:36.724 --> 29:38.609
Calling the FBI,
I know I should've told you.

29:38.693 --> 29:41.228
It's okay, sweetheart.

29:41.279 --> 29:43.664
I'm just really
proud of you.

29:43.731 --> 29:46.900
But you're
in the system now.

29:46.951 --> 29:48.418
You know, so it's only a matter
of time before people start--

29:48.503 --> 29:51.171
No. They're not like that.

29:51.239 --> 29:52.739
Agent Dunham promised.

29:52.791 --> 29:57.678
She said no one would
harass us anymore.

29:57.745 --> 30:00.514
Come on, let's get
in the house, Em.

30:00.581 --> 30:03.267
- Dad.
- This isn't a discussion.

30:03.351 --> 30:05.752
Go pack your bags. Diane!
Dad, please.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.137
What? What is it?

30:07.222 --> 30:09.773
Black van across the street.
Just like the one in Baltimore.

30:09.858 --> 30:11.358
<i>Do what</i>
<i>your father says.</i>

30:28.076 --> 30:29.576
I need a pen.

30:29.627 --> 30:34.798
<i>I want to write down</i>
<i>the license plate.</i>

30:54.969 --> 30:57.104
Uh, excuse me.

30:57.155 --> 30:58.471
I'm looking
for Judge O'Malley.

30:58.523 --> 31:00.307
The judge is in chambers.
Do you have an appointment?

31:00.375 --> 31:03.143
Uh, no, but um...

31:03.194 --> 31:04.328
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

31:04.412 --> 31:05.913
<i>due to a reported</i>
<i>emergency,</i>

31:05.980 --> 31:07.647
<i>please proceed immediately</i>
<i>to the nearest exit.</i>

31:07.699 --> 31:09.983
<i>Please remain calm,</i>

31:10.034 --> 31:14.588
<i>and obey the instructions</i>
<i>of court officers.</i>

31:14.655 --> 31:16.423
What do you got, boy?
What do you got?

31:23.715 --> 31:25.132
<i>26 and 28 are clear.</i>

31:25.183 --> 31:27.467
<i>What about the wheel well?</i>

31:32.840 --> 31:33.840
Hey, I got it!

31:59.000 --> 32:00.300
If you see him, I don't want
you to confront him.

32:00.368 --> 32:01.635
Just keep your
eyes on him,

32:01.702 --> 32:04.221
<i>and you can either let</i>
<i>Agent Broyles or myself know.</i>

32:04.305 --> 32:05.806
<i>Okay. Thank you.</i>

32:08.259 --> 32:09.726
<i>It's me. We were right.</i>

32:09.811 --> 32:11.878
It's rigged up to some sort
of remote detonation trigger.

32:11.930 --> 32:13.263
Well, how long will it
take to disarm?

32:13.348 --> 32:15.482
They don't know yet,
but it's pretty elaborate.

32:15.549 --> 32:16.483
<i>Okay, keep me informed.</i>

32:16.550 --> 32:17.484
Will do.

32:17.551 --> 32:19.403
They found the bomb?

32:19.487 --> 32:20.821
This thing goes off,

32:20.888 --> 32:22.155
we're gonna need to clear
a 200-meter blast radius.

32:22.223 --> 32:23.607
Maybe you should help
the police set up a perimeter.

32:23.691 --> 32:26.059
I know what you're doing,
and I'm not going anywhere.

32:26.110 --> 32:28.412
Olivia...

32:29.730 --> 32:31.415
What that man
said to you...

32:31.499 --> 32:33.566
That you're gonna die...

32:33.618 --> 32:38.571
Maybe this is what
he was talking about.

32:38.623 --> 32:40.874
I can't live
my life like that.

32:40.925 --> 32:45.929
Or do my job.

32:47.382 --> 32:49.132
There's no reason
for you guys to be here.

32:49.217 --> 32:50.767
This thing's wired
with multiple redundancies.

32:50.852 --> 32:52.419
<i>Could take hours.</i>

32:52.470 --> 32:54.554
That guy could remote-trigger
the device any time.

32:56.474 --> 32:59.309
Hey, can you tell me
what frequency

32:59.394 --> 33:00.360
that bomb is rigged
to receive?

33:00.428 --> 33:02.429
Probably.

33:02.480 --> 33:05.265
Yeah, why?
What are you thinking?

33:05.316 --> 33:06.483
<i>Hey, it's me again.</i>

33:06.567 --> 33:09.536
Have everybody turn their
radios to 432.5 megahertz.

33:15.877 --> 33:16.994
Hey.

33:17.078 --> 33:21.798
Hey, Judge O'Malley!

33:21.883 --> 33:25.719
You don't even
know who I am.

33:25.786 --> 33:28.672
No, no. Should I?

33:32.977 --> 33:35.628
You took my family from me.

33:35.680 --> 33:40.984
And I'm gonna take you
away from yours.

33:41.069 --> 33:43.020
<i>It's over, Mr. Duncan.</i>

33:43.104 --> 33:44.571
We blocked your signal.

33:44.638 --> 33:46.189
<i>Nobody wants</i>
<i>to hurt you,</i>

33:46.274 --> 33:49.576
<i>so you can just</i>
<i>put your hands up,</i>

33:49.643 --> 33:54.281
and we'll just
walk out of here.

33:54.332 --> 33:56.166
No.

33:56.250 --> 33:57.650
Nobody's going anywhere.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.920
<i>Albert, you do not</i>
<i>want to do this.</i>

33:59.987 --> 34:02.339
Don't.

34:02.423 --> 34:04.257
He...

34:04.325 --> 34:05.509
He took everything from me.

34:05.593 --> 34:08.045
Okay, I understand
why you're upset.

34:08.129 --> 34:12.215
<i>But you can't do this.</i>
<i>You can't.</i>

34:12.300 --> 34:13.216
Albert...

34:13.301 --> 34:15.385
This is not my fault.

34:15.469 --> 34:18.105
<i>This is because of him.</i>

34:18.172 --> 34:20.357
And this is how
it has to end.

34:20.440 --> 34:21.358
No, you're wrong.

34:21.442 --> 34:23.560
<i>Nothing has to happen.</i>

34:23.643 --> 34:26.063
Nothing is written
in stone.

34:26.147 --> 34:29.516
You and I--
we don't have to die here today.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.118
<i>Now, whatever</i>
<i>happens next</i>

34:31.185 --> 34:35.237
is up to you.
You are in control.

34:38.493 --> 34:40.377
I'm not ready
to die today.

34:40.460 --> 34:46.466
I don't think
that you are either.

34:50.804 --> 34:56.810
<i>Think about all these people.</i>
<i>They have children too.</i>

35:23.121 --> 35:25.872
<i>We're not home. Please leave a message.</i>

35:25.923 --> 35:27.740
Uh, Mr. Mallum,
this is Olivia Dunham.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.426
<i>We defused the bomb.</i>

35:29.510 --> 35:31.545
<i>A lot of people's lives</i>
<i>were saved today.</i>

35:31.596 --> 35:34.214
<i>I thought Emily</i>
<i>would like to know.</i>

35:34.265 --> 35:37.267
Hey, Em.

35:44.692 --> 35:46.426
Jim?

35:46.477 --> 35:47.794
<i>Jim, what is it?</i>

35:47.862 --> 35:49.229
They took her.
They took Emily.

35:55.414 --> 35:57.384
We traced the plate number
Jim Mallum provided.

35:57.385 --> 35:58.886
Boston PD hailed it.

35:58.937 --> 36:00.674
It was just
a dry-cleaning van.

36:00.675 --> 36:02.292
Thanks for
letting us know.

36:02.376 --> 36:03.910
Her father was wrong.

36:03.961 --> 36:05.745
I think he was
just being paranoid.

36:05.796 --> 36:07.597
I don't think Emily
was abducted at all.

36:07.682 --> 36:09.516
Then where the hell
is she?

36:09.583 --> 36:11.218
I think I might know.

36:15.306 --> 36:16.790
<i>Emily!</i>

36:16.858 --> 36:21.311
Emily!

36:23.814 --> 36:28.118
You're freezing cold.
We have to get you out of here.

36:28.202 --> 36:29.202
<i>Her pulse is weak.</i>

36:29.270 --> 36:30.487
I'll call the ambulance.

36:30.571 --> 36:31.488
Help's on its way.

36:31.572 --> 36:33.823
It doesn't matter.

36:33.908 --> 36:36.493
There's nothing
anyone can do.

36:36.577 --> 36:40.847
It's just my time.

36:40.915 --> 36:42.415
<i>This is Agent Lincoln Lee.</i>

36:42.466 --> 36:44.801
I need an ambulance
at  park right away.

36:44.886 --> 36:48.004
No, Emily, you told me what's
in your drawings is inevitable.

36:48.089 --> 36:49.306
But you're wrong.

36:49.390 --> 36:53.493
Today we saved all of those
people because of you.

36:53.561 --> 36:54.544
<i>Emily.</i>

36:59.734 --> 37:01.801
Oh, God.

37:01.852 --> 37:04.187
Emily...

37:13.748 --> 37:18.418
<i>I've known for a while.</i>

37:18.485 --> 37:20.337
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

37:20.421 --> 37:22.322
I knew you'd be here.

37:26.427 --> 37:30.997
Em, please.

37:31.048 --> 37:33.800
They're on their way.

37:33.851 --> 37:38.504
Can you just hold on?

37:38.556 --> 37:43.393
I think you were right.

37:43.477 --> 37:47.981
Everyone has a purpose.

37:50.618 --> 37:54.704
They saved
those people today.

37:54.789 --> 37:57.791
Maybe that was mine.

38:24.352 --> 38:25.852
<i>Hey.</i>

38:25.903 --> 38:27.720
Hey.

38:27.772 --> 38:30.323
<i>They told me what happened</i>
<i>with the girl.</i>

38:30.391 --> 38:34.110
I'm really sorry.

38:34.195 --> 38:36.403
They said it was
some kind of stroke.

38:36.864 --> 38:40.283
Yeah. The overload of electrical
activity in her brain

38:40.368 --> 38:43.403
was just too much.

38:43.454 --> 38:44.537
So the very thing that
gave her her ability...

38:44.588 --> 38:47.040
Also killed her.

38:47.091 --> 38:49.209
Walter said that
even if we'd known,

38:49.260 --> 38:55.265
we couldn't have done
anything to prevent it.

38:57.418 --> 39:01.254
He says, "a candle
that burns twice as bright

39:01.305 --> 39:02.489
burns half as long."

39:04.225 --> 39:05.525
I'm guessing you're
not finding that

39:05.592 --> 39:06.893
all that comforting
right now.

39:06.944 --> 39:10.530
No, not as much
as he does.

39:10.597 --> 39:12.899
<i>Is that an observer?</i>

39:12.950 --> 39:15.402
Is that what
you call them?

39:15.453 --> 39:17.620
Yeah, why?
What do you call 'em?

39:17.705 --> 39:20.540
Well, up until now we haven't
called them anything.

39:25.112 --> 39:26.463
Things really are
different here.

39:26.547 --> 39:30.500
What do you know?

39:30.584 --> 39:32.001
Well, they show up
at significant events

39:32.086 --> 39:34.054
all through history.

39:34.121 --> 39:36.122
Well, how do they do that?

39:36.173 --> 39:37.340
Like some kind
of time travel?

39:37.408 --> 39:41.394
No, it's not really
time travel, per se.

39:41.462 --> 39:45.932
Uh, it's more like they exist
in all times simultaneously.

39:46.000 --> 39:49.936
They don't experience time
the same way that you and I do.

39:49.987 --> 39:55.658
So they know what's
going to happen.

39:55.743 --> 39:56.659
I mean, if one of them
said something

39:56.744 --> 39:58.578
about the future...

39:58.645 --> 40:03.149
Could they be wrong?

40:03.200 --> 40:07.187
Well, no, I don't really
see how they could.

40:07.254 --> 40:10.123
They don't predict
the future, Olivia.

40:10.174 --> 40:16.179
They've already
experienced it.

40:20.334 --> 40:21.718
Did one of them
make contact with you?

40:21.802 --> 40:26.773
Have they reached out?

40:26.840 --> 40:29.442
No.

40:50.631 --> 40:51.548
I hope it's not
too late.

40:51.632 --> 40:53.416
No, I, uh...

40:53.501 --> 40:55.218
I just got home.
Come in.

40:55.302 --> 40:57.470
I wanted to see you.

40:57.538 --> 40:58.972
Especially after
I spoke with Phillip.

40:59.039 --> 41:01.641
He told me what
happened to the girl.

41:01.708 --> 41:02.725
Are you all right?

41:02.810 --> 41:03.726
Yeah, I'm fine.

41:03.811 --> 41:05.711
Really, I-I-I--
I am okay.

41:07.765 --> 41:09.732
Sweetheart,
about what you said

41:09.817 --> 41:12.101
when you came to see me
this afternoon...

41:12.186 --> 41:13.486
I never should've reacted
the way that I did.

41:13.554 --> 41:15.438
I'm sorry, I should not
have accused you.

41:15.523 --> 41:18.158
Please, I-I'm the one
that needs to apologize.

41:18.225 --> 41:20.760
What happened to you as a child
was unconscionable.

41:20.828 --> 41:24.747
You've come so far,
I just forget sometimes

41:24.832 --> 41:28.084
how much you've been
expected to forgive.

41:28.169 --> 41:33.089
I'm not angry with you.

41:36.343 --> 41:39.379
I thought I was
going to die today.

41:39.430 --> 41:41.097
And one of the things
that I kept thinking

41:41.182 --> 41:43.016
was that you--

41:43.083 --> 41:48.221
you wouldn't know
how I felt.

41:50.891 --> 41:54.060
You're the closest thing
I have to a mother.

41:54.111 --> 41:58.264
And I love you.

41:58.315 --> 42:02.151
Oh, Olive...

42:02.236 --> 42:05.905
What? What's wrong?

42:05.956 --> 42:07.790
I've just been getting
these migraines, that's all.

42:07.875 --> 42:11.110
It's really not
that big of a deal.

42:11.161 --> 42:12.378
Well, do you have
any medicine?

42:12.446 --> 42:14.130
Yeah, my doctor
gave me some.

42:14.215 --> 42:16.833
Good. And what about food?
Have you eaten?

42:16.917 --> 42:17.834
No.

42:17.918 --> 42:20.920
I'm going to make
you some soup.

42:20.971 --> 42:21.971
You know, y--

42:22.056 --> 42:23.473
you don't have to do that.

42:23.557 --> 42:24.841
I want to.

42:24.925 --> 42:29.062
I'm the closest thing
you have to a mother. Remember.

42:29.129 --> 42:33.099
Thank you.
That would be great.

42:33.150 --> 42:34.851
Tomorrow I'm going to send
some medication over.

42:34.935 --> 42:36.436
It's a new drug
we've been working on.

42:36.487 --> 42:37.570
It's remarkable.
